1
00:00:00,214 --> 00:00:04,300
MATT: The small village of Bronbog has recently
come under a baneful curse. The young are born

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,011
deformed and demonic. The denizens are driven to
madness and suicide. Those that remain, stubborn

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:14,044
as they are, have fallen silent. The nature of
this curse has drawn the attention of one man.

4
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:22,910
VIN: I am Kaulder, the witch hunter. An 800 year
old immortal. (growls)

5
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,511
MATT: Now, Kaulder, you've seen such curses before
drive whole communities to ruin. But from what

6
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:39,054
your experience as a witch hunter has taught you
is that the usual purpose of such a curse is not

7
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:44,139
just to spread pain and suffering, but to prepare
the land with enough misery and darkness for some

8
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:52,771
ulterior motive. To transform the fane of the land
into a sight ripe for dark ritual. You, in seeking

9
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,342
the source of this curse, have gathered up a
handful of proven warriors in the land to

10
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:59,962
investigate what is actually going down in
Bronbog.

11
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:05,753
LAURA: I'm Vex'ahlia, the stealthy half-elven
ranger. Separated from my twin brother and on the

12
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:06,943
hunt.

13
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:12,119
TRAVIS: I'm Grog, a goliath barbarian with a love
for combat, women, and ale.

14
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,862
JESSICA: I am The Headmistress, a human monk whose
family was killed during a civil war and who's now

15
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:19,844
out seeking vengeance!

16
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:25,133
DAN: I'm Dupont Dupont, dwarven rogue and if
there's coin to be had, I'll be there!

17
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:32,310
MATT: As the five of you trudge up to the
outskirts of the Dreamseep Marshlands, the sun

18
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,400
slowly begins to set. The mildewed, awful set
water smell of the swamp begins to take over your

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,384
senses. As darkness slowly descends upon the
landscape, you can see a bit of light poking

20
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:49,102
through the trees. As you slowly become aware,
you've reached the outskirts of Bronbog proper.

21
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:54,574
You see tons of huts and small villages all
darkened, left desolate. You hear the cricketing

22
00:01:54,574 --> 00:02:00,523
sound of various insects in the swamp begin to
swell. The frogs calling out into the darkness.

23
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:08,151
You approach the only true sign of life in your
vicinity, a small hovel, mildewed on the outside,

24
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:11,053
with a single window that is aglow against the
darkness.

25
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,755
LAURA: Can we peek in the window?

26
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:17,928
MATT: You go up to the side of the window and peek
in the corner. The interior is almost a hoarder's

27
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:22,030
home. There are a series of crates and barrels and
papers scattered about like this place has been

28
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,584
packaged and unpacked multiple times. Someone's
been trying to decide whether to leave or stay.

29
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:33,985
You see in the light a female form, humanoid,
sitting over a desk in the corner, currently

30
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,967
sobbing to herself silently.

31
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:41,536
LAURA: She seems distraught.

32
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,395
DAN: We should probably knock.

33
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:46,255
VIN: Hmm.

34
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:50,125
JESSICA: We're all going to get destroyed by this
girl.

35
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,067
DAN: She's a hoarder! Is she going to put us in a
box, label us?

36
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,914
JESSICA: Tons of d20 lying about.

37
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,916
TRAVIS: It smells really good around here.

38
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,517
JESSICA: Knock. Who's knocking?

39
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:03,126
LAURA: Leader.

40
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:09,576
VIN: Am I knocking? Is that what we're doing. Did
this turn into Kaulder the knocker?

41
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:13,224
MATT: Every journey begins with a single knock.

42
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:20,925
VIN: I can't be surprised, so I guess I'm--

43
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:24,694
JESSICA: Shouldn't we perception the house first?

44
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:25,943
VIN: Maybe.

45
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:27,795
JESSICA: I feel like we're walking into--

46
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:29,125
MATT: Roll a perception check.

47
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,511
VIN: I will. My perception bonus is plus six.

48
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:35,485
LAURA: I think that's a 14.

49
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:38,415
VIN: I like a 14. It's a little bit of a fail
roll.

50
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:45,766
MATT: As you approach the door, the door itself is
not as mildewed as the rest of the building. There

51
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:53,516
is a general appearance to this that the rest of
the house, while old and weathered, this door is

52
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:57,837
much fresher than you'd expect. That's the best
you can ascertain of that nature. It does catch

53
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,926
your eye.

54
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:03,211
DAN: Well, at least she cleaned the door!

55
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:11,476
TRAVIS: Is everybody all hesitant? I'll knock! Let
me show you how we do this. I go up and pound on

56
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,196
the door real hard.

57
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:17,067
MATT: (thudding) The sound echoes through the
interior. You hear a voice go (startled yell) on

58
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:24,175
the other side. A couple of footsteps pitter up to
the side. The door slowly opens with a creak. A

59
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:29,215
young woman in her early to mid 20s, her face
streaked with tears and dirt, very simple

60
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:35,257
clothing. She looks through, peering at the group.
"I'm sorry. Is there a problem? What's going on?"

61
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:43,500
TRAVIS: I don't do well with emotions. I'm really
the group knocker. Somebody else want to take it

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,257
from here?

63
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,967
LAURA: Are you upset, dear? What's been happening
here?

64
00:04:48,967 --> 00:05:00,109
MATT: "It's best you not be here. Death awaits
those who come. What are you doing? Flee! This is

65
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:06,087
"my cause! I chose to live here. Let me take this
onus. You still have a chance to get away!"

66
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:07,777
VIN: Onus?

67
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:08,918
LAURA: We don't run.

68
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:10,128
DAN: Get away from what?

69
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,528
MATT: "Curse."

70
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,067
VIN: We pillage.

71
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,968
JESSICA: I'm with him. We pillage.

72
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:21,134
VIN: She's saying we should run away from the
curse.

73
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:26,098
MATT: She seems honestly distraught in hopes of
trying to instill you with this same fear.

74
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:30,939
LAURA: But maybe she knows more. Have you done
research? Why are you here when everybody else has

75
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:31,948
fled?

76
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:39,248
MATT: "Because my family's always been here. It's
not much, but it's still home. If we all leave,

77
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:44,858
"there's no chance anyone will come and save us.
This whole land will fall to ruin. At the very

78
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:49,424
"least, if I die here, maybe that'll be enough of a
reason for someone to come and alleviate this

79
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,573
"terrible night's bane."

80
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:56,198
VIN: Who's responsible for the curse?

81
00:05:56,198 --> 00:06:03,209
MATT: "I don't know for sure. We hear voices in
the night in the far ends of this swamp. We hear

82
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:10,299
"laughing and terrible gurgling in the swamp.
Voices of languages we don't know. We've had a few

83
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:17,738
"folks go out to try and stop this and they never
came back. Recently, I've heard terrible, wistful

84
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:21,310
"howling of voices moaning in the morning mists."

85
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,241
VIN: Do we know which direction the swamps are
from this?

86
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:32,388
MATT: You're currently a good hour's worth of
travel into the swamp to meet this. You're in the

87
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:38,339
heart of it right now. It goes further out towards
the distant mountain range. You gather from what

88
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:44,780
you have traveled, it gets more desolate, more murky.
The water level seems to sink even further.

89
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:51,989
TRAVIS: There's laughing, gurgling, moaning. We
sure it's not a bar? Might be so bad.

90
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,796
JESSICA: What can we get out of this?

91
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:57,841
MATT: "I can collect some change from the few that
have stayed. I've only got a bit of gold to my

92
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:02,211
"name as well, but we'd be happy to put it up if
you'll be of help. Please, I ask."

93
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:06,061
DAN: A bit is much better than none.

94
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:09,342
TRAVIS: You're greedy.

95
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:17,219
MATT: "I'll speak to the denizens around. If you
come back, alive, that is, we'll have all of

96
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,701
"our money ready for you. Yes, please!"

97
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,480
JESSICA: I think we should get half up front.

98
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,691
DAN: You drive a hard bargain!

99
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,849
TRAVIS: What do you have on you?

100
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,720
MATT: Go ahead and roll a persuasion check.

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,311
JESSICA: 11 plus one. 12.

102
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:39,181
MATT: Okay. She goes, "I'll offer you what I
have." She stumbles off and start thumbing through

103
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:43,631
all these boxes, making this loud clattering
noise. Comes back about five minutes later. "Here.

104
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:50,773
"120 gold. It's all I've got to my name, but if
this means to you that we have your service to aid

105
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:55,062
"us, please. This bravery is a welcome change
around here. If you'd like, I can take you to

106
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:57,322
"these ruins outside the village."

107
00:07:57,322 --> 00:08:03,882
JESSICA: I grab the gold purse and I say: Go ahead
and show us the way. As I put it in my backpack.

108
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:10,053
MATT: "All right! This way!" She walks out past
you, closing the door behind her and locking it

109
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:16,203
with a key. Turns around. "Follow me into the
marsh." She steps out into the night air, deeper

110
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:17,462
into the swamp.

111
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,733
TRAVIS: Yeah, we follow.

112
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,201
VIN: No mounts?

113
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:26,915
MATT: No mounts to get here. You figure the swamp
is hard to traverse with beasts of burden. As you

114
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:31,953
step into the swamp, about an hour's worth of
tense travel continues. You hear the occasional

115
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:39,444
call of an owl into the night air. The swamp
itself grows more and more sticky. You're finding

116
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:44,813
yourself with each sloshing step finding more tension
and drag against the back of your feet. A slow fog

117
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:51,943
begins to roll in as the night truly takes hold of
the Dreamseep Marshlands. I would like you all to

118
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:53,094
roll a perception check.

119
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:56,822
LAURA: Oh, Jesus, really?

120
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,574
JESSICA: Mine's so bad.

121
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,173
LAURA: I rolled a one!

122
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,433
VIN: 13 plus six.

123
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:03,759
MATT: 19.

124
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,953
TRAVIS: 20!

125
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:07,503
MATT: Okay! What'd you get? Perception.

126
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,756
JESSICA: Eight.

127
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,124
DAN: Three!

128
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,759
LAURA: Natural one!

129
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,374
TRAVIS: Great.

130
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:17,773
MATT: As the woman and part of your party begins
to travel forth, Grog and Kaulder.

131
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:21,141
DAN: Perception is plus zero for me.

132
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,364
VIN: It is?

133
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:23,714
DAN: I'm not a wise man.

134
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:27,239
JESSICA: Can't even see your hand in front
of your face.

135
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:31,829
VIN: Thank god I've got some wisdom here. After
800 years, he learned a thing or two.

136
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:37,888
MATT: Pressing forward, part of your party steps
forward. Grog and Kaulder, both of you guys stop

137
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:42,359
for a second, your senses kicking in. the fog
that's rolling, while swirling naturally, is

138
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:48,292
beginning to coalesce and gather into shapes. You
see slowly piercing beyond the veil of the mist.

139
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:55,704
You can see arms appear and then vanish.
Occasionally a face chuckles and disappears back

140
00:09:55,704 --> 00:10:02,609
into the surrounding vapor. You notice, just
beyond Vex, it begins to coalesce behind her in the

141
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:07,134
form of a humanoid wraith-like entity that begins
to reach out for her.

142
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,861
LAURA: I'm trying to pull my foot out of this
muck. I can't even see what's going on right now.

143
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,379
VIN: How far am I?

144
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,636
MATT: She's probably 20 feet ahead of you.

145
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,303
VIN: I should attack.

146
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:20,204
MATT: All right! Seeing this.

147
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,485
VIN: Specter, wraith, something's got to die.

148
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:27,245
MATT: There you go! You, rushing forward seeing
this entity, you burst forward with speed,

149
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:32,296
sloshing through the mud. As it reaches out to
claw, you run forward arcing your sword down in a

150
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:37,393
large strike against the creature. Go ahead and
roll an attack.

151
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:38,776
VIN: 13.

152
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:43,965
MATT: 13 is what you needed to hit its armor
class. Go ahead and roll damage on that. Cool, so

153
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:45,883
that's a total of five damage.

154
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:49,823
LAURA: I spin around. What the what? What are you
attacking?!

155
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:52,474
VIN: I'm attacking the wraith that's behind you.

156
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:53,935
LAURA: Oh!

157
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:55,933
MATT: You see coming up between the two of you--

158
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,970
LAURA: It's a wraith!

159
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,993
MATT: Grog, you're prepared for this, you pull
your axe out in preparation. I want everyone to

160
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:04,253
roll initiative.

161
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:07,734
DAN: It must have been terrifying to see a witch
hunter sprint toward you with its sword.

162
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:14,185
MATT: Kaulder is up first and then coming up the
rear end, we have Dupont.

163
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:16,331
DAN: Someone has to do it, may as well be me.

164
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:23,483
MATT: As you see a second wraith beginning to form
behind you in the center of the group. You're up

165
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,863
first so, Kaulder, what do you want to do with
your next round of combat?

166
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:28,179
VIN: Let me light up the sword.

167
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:32,863
MATT: You use your quick action, you bring the
blade back. As you concentrate on it, closing your

168
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:37,383
eyes, drawing on the mystical power from your
training. Reddish-yellow flames begin to burst up

169
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:42,630
the outside of this metallic blade. It lights up
the exterior of the swamp. The wraith recoils in

170
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,544
fear. What else are you going to do now?

171
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:48,886
VIN: I'm going to attack!

172
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:52,274
MATT: You get two attacks with your sword. Go
ahead and roll twice.

173
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:55,912
VIN: Nice!

174
00:11:55,912 --> 00:12:00,564
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll the first
attack damage with an extra d6 because of the

175
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:01,743
fire.

176
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,144
VIN: Baller.

177
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:09,606
MATT: Right? That comes to a total of four damage
plus the four from the sword, so that's eight

178
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:14,532
against the entity. As you streak down with your
first attack, the flames send the creature

179
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:19,949
separating for a moment, the vaporous mist
bisected in the middle of the air. It slowly

180
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:24,245
reforms. Using that action, recoil for a second
strike downard. Go ahead and roll your next

181
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,919
attack.

182
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,254
VIN: 17.

183
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:31,698
MATT: 17. Roll damage for the second strike.

184
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:33,803
LAURA: That's beautiful.

185
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,417
DAN: Just obliterated.

186
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,245
VIN: What is that, 20?

187
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:44,163
MATT: With the second attack, you swipe down. This
time the orangish-yellow flame burning a bright vibrant

188
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:49,624
white with the intent as your witch hunter
instinct brings the blade down. The wraith screams

189
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:55,303
out in pain as it dissipates into the swamp air,
completely destroyed with Vex standing there

190
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,596
looking dumbfounded by it.

191
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:59,710
LAURA: Gah! Kaulder! Thank you!

192
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,272
VIN: You're quite welcome, Vex!

193
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:07,313
MATT: However, at that same moment, you hear the
creeping sound of the second wraith that seemed to

194
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:10,394
draw up behind you. Next in combat, that would
be--

195
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,284
VIN: Where's our friend right now?

196
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:18,051
MATT: She's currently back with Grog at this
moment, hiding behind the large goliath barbarian.

197
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:20,536
So what do you want to do, Headmistress?

198
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:22,613
JESSICA: Extra attack, I guess.

199
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:27,204
MATT: You dart up, your monk fists up. You see the
focus of your ki energy causes the exterior of your

200
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:30,044
flesh to momentarily harden like iron.

201
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,330
JESSICA: Hell yeah.

202
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,829
MATT: You rush up with unnatural speed. The wraith
not even realizing your presence. Go ahead and

203
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,410
roll three attacks.

204
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,742
JESSICA: 11.

205
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:40,992
MATT: That hits. Roll two more times.

206
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,900
DAN: Punched a ghost!

207
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,362
JESSICA: Two.

208
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,354
MATT: That is going to miss, unfortunately. Third
attack?

209
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:49,259
JESSICA: 12.

210
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,732
MATT: That hits. Roll damage twice. It's a d6 plus
four each strike.

211
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,733
JESSICA: Two.

212
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,082
MATT: That's six. One more time.

213
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:59,774
JESSICA: Five.

214
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:04,813
MATT: Nice! Nine damage. As you rush up, you punch
the wraith from one side. You see its form shimmer

215
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:09,101
from the impact, you go for a secondary uppercut,
it seems to disperse around your fist, completely

216
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:14,201
missing in the air. You rear back for a kick, this
time it's unprepared for the secondary attack. You

217
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:18,940
smack it upside. For a moment, you feel that the
wraith has physical form around your fist and it

218
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,747
takes the impact, drifting back about five feet.
That concludes your turn. Vex, you're up.

219
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:27,793
LAURA: I think Grog was next, he had 17.

220
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:28,763
MATT: Okay.

221
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:35,261
TRAVIS: I take the greataxe and I swing it and I
go for a frenzied strike so I get an additional

222
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,353
attack.

223
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:41,264
MATT: Leaving the woman behind you, fearing for
her life, you go into an angry rage, froth forming

224
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:46,021
at the corner of your mouth. You charge up against
the wraith, flanking it from the side with the

225
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:47,083
Headmistress.

226
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,733
TRAVIS: Say: Here, Moppet. (yells) That's really
good! That's a 24.

227
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,802
MATT: That'll hit! Next attack.

228
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,213
TRAVIS: That's a nine.

229
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:55,744
MATT: Whiff. Third attack now.

230
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,904
TRAVIS: That's 14!

231
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:01,224
MATT: 14 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage
twice.

232
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:12,034
TRAVIS: d12. That's nine. Dang. 12.

233
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:18,294
MATT: That's twice. You missed the one. As you
swing up, you swing the axe wide. It cleaves

234
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:23,334
through part of it. There's now a burst of blue
ectoplasmic energy dissipates from the immediate

235
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:28,254
blast of the attack. You swing back with a
backhand, it dodges out of the way. It's going for

236
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:32,584
your throat. As you do, you bring the axe,
backhanding it to the side. The wraith is pushed

237
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:37,972
off of its axis. It's angry and now intent on you.
It is now the wraith's turn.

238
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:42,169
LAURA: Why?!

239
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,079
DAN: Directed by M. Night Shyamalan!

240
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,065
MATT: It turns to you, reaches out, its face
contorting from these large, angry ghostly fangs.

241
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:54,356
That's a 21 to hit.

242
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:55,566
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

243
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:58,720
MATT: Second strike as well. That's a 14 to hit.

244
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,925
TRAVIS: Nope! You miss.

245
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:04,535
MATT: As the wraith reaches out, it claws the
front of your chest, but the claws seem to seep

246
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:09,676
into your chest cavity, the arm going up to the
wrist. You feel a cold grip on your heart like it

247
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:14,459
stopped beating for a moment. You take 21 points
of necrotic damage and your hit points are

248
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,345
permanently lowered by 21 points.

249
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:18,111
(yelling)

250
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,903
VIN: That's kind of harsh!

251
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,946
MATT: Wraiths are harsh, yo!

252
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:23,286
LAURA: That's major!

253
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,506
VIN: Harsh DM alert!

254
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:28,305
MATT: You don't stroll into my danger. You got to
want to live!

255
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:30,495
DAN: Total party kill incoming!

256
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:35,006
MATT: A third wraith begins to drift out of the
mist behind Grog. Now it's your turn.

257
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:38,776
LAURA: I see what it's doing and I Hunter's Mark
that wraith.

258
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:44,666
MATT: As you concentrate on it, your experience
hunting ghosts clarify its vision. Go ahead and

259
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,010
make your attacks.

260
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:54,126
LAURA: Oh no! I'm so excited. Oh jeez, that sucks.
12.

261
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,787
MATT: 12 just misses.

262
00:16:55,787 --> 00:17:00,937
LAURA: I'm going to do it again. That's better,
that's 18. No, that's 20.

263
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:07,656
MATT: The second arrow finds purchase inside the
ghostial entity, keeping its form semi-coalesced

264
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:10,506
to attack Grog last round.

265
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:16,437
LAURA: Ten plus Hunter's Mark, what's that? Is
that a five? 15.

266
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:21,118
MATT: 15 points of damage. As it goes back to try
and reach into Grog a second time, your second

267
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:25,338
arrow finds it. You see the face burst around as
the arrow just barely misses the side of your

268
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:28,002
head, disappearing into the distant swamp. The
second wraith is destroyed.

269
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,137
LAURA: Yes!

270
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:32,258
MATT: The third wraith, however, is still coming
up from behind Grog.

271
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,652
TRAVIS: Why me?!

272
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,828
MATT: Because you're big and scary.

273
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:37,028
TRAVIS: Makes sense.

274
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,320
MATT: Go ahead.

275
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,248
DAN: I've seen some really impressive things so
far, so I'm going to try to not shortchange this.

276
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:46,426
I'm going to sprint with all of my might, try and
backflip over Grog and the wraith and try to stab

277
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,046
it in the back.

278
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:54,628
MATT: All right! The dwarven rogue lowers his
head, ninja runs across the surface of the

279
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:58,167
marshlands like his body has no weight
momentarily. Leap off of the air. Make an

280
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,528
acrobatics check.

281
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:02,555
DAN: 29.

282
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:08,748
MATT: 29! With a deft silent landing behind the
wraith, you pull your daggers and go in for the dual

283
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,576
attack.

284
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:12,107
LAURA: This is epic.

285
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,796
DAN: That is 18.

286
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,587
MATT: 18 hits, go ahead and roll the second
attack.

287
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:18,146
DAN: That is a 17.

288
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:22,016
MATT: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage and sneak
attack damage on the first attack.

289
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,625
DAN: Oh man, I need 4d6.

290
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,577
LAURA: Here's a d6. Here's a d6.

291
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:31,836
MATT: That's a d4. Oh that's for the daggers,
right. Gotcha. Nine damage on the daggers.

292
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:34,707
JESSICA: I know, it's so tiny!

293
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:38,408
DAN: Plus seven so 16 plus nine, 25 damage.

294
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:44,997
MATT: 25 damage, nice! As the newly formed wraith
sneaks up behind Grog, you flip over it unnoticed

295
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:49,817
in the shadow, you being your stealthy roguish
self. Slam them both into the center of this

296
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:55,426
mystical center of the wraith. You see a flash of
blue ghostly energy and it screams out from the

297
00:18:55,426 --> 00:19:01,567
pain, disperses. Your daggers no longer have any
physical purchase in the creature. It reforms

298
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,407
around, turning and looking towards you.

299
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:06,738
DAN: Uh-oh! Surprise!

300
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:09,988
MATT: That's your turn. Coming to the top of the
round. Kaulder, you're up next.

301
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,837
VIN: How far am I from the dwarf?

302
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:14,329
MATT: I'd say you're probably 25 feet.

303
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:18,317
VIN: Would it be worth a Mystic Blast?

304
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:21,133
MATT: Certainly, if you want to! Go for it.

305
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,317
VIN: Critical!

306
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:25,317
TRAVIS: Yes!

307
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:36,628
VIN: Critical, guys! Critical! Doesn't matter what
decade you're in, guys. A critical is a critical

308
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:39,582
and it's a Mystic Blast.

309
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:42,188
MATT: Roll damage and multiply it by two.

310
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:47,111
VIN: Can I just enjoy this critical for a second?

311
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:48,532
MATT: Heck yeah, dude, take it in.

312
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:53,264
VIN: Critical's dice is-- Okay.

313
00:19:53,264 --> 00:20:01,838
MATT: Roll it again because you get to roll it
twice. That's ten damage plus your bonus.

314
00:20:01,838 --> 00:20:02,978
VIN: Plus three.

315
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:09,199
MATT: As the entity's reaching up, now facing
Dupont. You turn around for a second, glance, and

316
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:13,409
there's a burst of purplish energy from your eyes
as you pull on your mystic background. As you pull

317
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,968
your arm back, you can see a bit of arcane flame
gather in your palm and you release it outward. It

318
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,580
goes streaking through the night air, lighting up
the forest that's around, slamming into the

319
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,797
wraith. You hear it finally scream out into the
air as it is dispersed and destroyed from the

320
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:30,568
blast of mystic energy. You're sitting there. The
front of your face is a little singed from the

321
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,937
nearby impact from the arcane energy.

322
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,088
VIN: Apologies.

323
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:36,418
DAN: Now that was a close shave!

324
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,629
TRAVIS: I think it's actually an improvement.

325
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:40,420
DAN: Thank you.

326
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,439
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

327
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,820
DAN: There's a ghost behind you.

328
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,917
MATT: It calms down for a minute, the adrenaline
still pumping through your system. You take a few

329
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:50,711
breaths before your realize the mist is recoiling
and the swamp before you seems to be unveiled,

330
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,248
showing the rest of your path.

331
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:54,059
JESSICA: It was worth the 120 gold in my opinion!

332
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,648
TRAVIS: Glad we collected up front.

333
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:58,719
DAN: He only lost half his life force!

334
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,610
LAURA: Oh.

335
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:07,411
MATT: The woman walks up to you and says, "That
power you hold. That's strange and ancient. What

336
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:08,900
"are you?"

337
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,030
VIN: It's a good question. I'm a witch hunter.

338
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,528
(laughter)

339
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:17,291
DAN: We all gasp.

340
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,008
(gasping)

341
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:25,820
MATT: She steps back with awe. "Well then, I'm
going to stay with you for the remainder of this

342
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,028
"journey."

343
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:28,820
JESSICA: Oh crap, she's coming with us.

344
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,921
VIN: Oh, she's coming. Okay, cool.

345
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,586
LAURA: Right. We'll protect you.

346
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:33,750
VIN: I'll need more gold.

347
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,480
MATT: She walks alongside you. You step further
into the marsh. Now, the actual liquid of the

348
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,902
swamp is up to your knee and thigh. Each step is
arduous. Eventually, you see a form in front of

349
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:48,211
you. A large, stone archway of a ruined castle or
establishment that has long-toppled over and

350
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:52,990
fallen into the swamp. As you look forward, I want
you all to make a perception check.

351
00:21:52,990 --> 00:22:00,961
VIN: 13 plus six. 19.

352
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,111
DAN: 16.

353
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,351
LAURA: Nine! I suck!

354
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:04,301
JESSICA: 16.

355
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:05,393
TRAVIS: 20.

356
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,819
MATT: Barbarian being so perceptive!

357
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:09,812
TRAVIS: That never happens.

358
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:13,411
LAURA: I keep looking at the purple coming from
your eyes and I get distracted.

359
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:21,592
MATT: Kaulder, Dupont, and Grog, as you guys
approach, you see in the center of this ruin

360
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:26,880
elevated beyond the rest of the swamp water.
There's a large stone platform, a table, much like

361
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:37,434
this, that has on top of it a series of small
trinkets and bone shards. It has some sacrificial

362
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:44,584
nature to it. It is relatively fresh blood,
meaning probably over the past two or three days.

363
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:48,913
Make an investigation check to truly ascertain the
nature of how long it's been there.

364
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:52,654
VIN: Plus four.

365
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,312
MATT: So what's the total on that?

366
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,304
VIN: 11.

367
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:58,144
MATT: It's hard to really get the nature of how
long it's been there. You gather it's probably

368
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:04,097
been a few days. You can't tell if it's human or
not. Regardless, as you approach the table, the

369
00:23:04,097 --> 00:23:11,860
moonlight seems to slowly wither and the room goes
very dark around you to the point where it's pitch

370
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,463
dark.

371
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:15,364
TRAVIS: I don't like it. I go into a rage.

372
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:17,772
JESSICA: Already?

373
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,566
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't like the dark.

374
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,964
DAN: Should I light a torch?

375
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:22,164
LAURA: Yeah.

376
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:27,485
MAT: As you're all here lost in darkness, Dupont,
you light the torch. It bursts, but it seems like

377
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:31,105
the darkness is constricting it. You're still
getting light, but it's very low.

378
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,425
DAN: That's not good.

379
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:33,996
MATT: The night air is trying to strangle it.

380
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,137
LAURA: Can we hear anything around us? Anybody's
voices?

381
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:40,718
MATT: As you take a moment to take this in, the
silence hits and you hear this whispering

382
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:47,925
beginning to surround you. Directionless, it has
no real source, but it is enough to grow louder

383
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:50,636
and louder to instill a lot of you with fear.

384
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:57,726
JESSICA: I grab our tagalong and yell at her:
Where have you taken us?!

385
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:01,585
MATT: As you look for her, you do not see
her. The darkness is too constricting at this

386
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:07,456
point. You hear a voice come out from the darkness
from the other side of the ritual table you're

387
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:08,577
standing at.

388
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:09,886
JESSICA: We're all going to die, guys!

389
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:16,713
MATT: "How eager they are to walk on. Unknowing
they come to the seat of their destiny." Another

390
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:22,306
voice comes from behind, it's the voice of the
young woman following you. "An offering of

391
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:23,631
"outsiders."

392
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,182
JESSICA: I knew it!

393
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:32,006
MATT: "It cleans the palate. It tastes to come."
"Shall we begin the next offering, dear sister?"

394
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:37,507
"Yes, yes we shall." The woman steps out of the
darkness, her head turned to the side. You see her

395
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:43,906
form shimmer. Behind it, you see her flesh extend
as her arms grow overly long, her form large and

396
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:48,964
hunched, this disgusting swamp hag vision. As she
looks forward and cackles, a second one of the

397
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:53,447
same type of physical presence steps in the
opposite side of the ritual table surrounding you.

398
00:24:53,447 --> 00:25:02,937
"Witch hunter, it seems you've come to your final
bout." What do you want to do?

399
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:10,348
VIN: I like this! Attack!

400
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:18,797
MATT: As your sword, still peeling with flame
behind you, you rush towards the first hag before

401
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:20,785
you. Go ahead and make a round of attacks.

402
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,891
VIN: That's a 17.

403
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:23,608
MATT: 17 hits. Roll a second attack. Yeah, it
does.

404
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:37,998
VIN: Critical! Guys, I don't make this up. It's
all 20s.

405
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:40,155
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage for the first
attack.

406
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,578
VIN: Seven.

407
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:47,208
MATT: So 12 points of damage on the first strike.
Streaks across the front of the hag. She pulls

408
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:51,339
back, the flames erupting from the wound in her
chest. You can see black, brackish blood beginning to

409
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:56,610
flow from the wound. She looks at you. Her face,
her crooked nose and evil, deep, sunken yellow

410
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,859
eyes. "It'll take more than that, Kaulder!" Roll
damage for the second strike.

411
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,869
VIN: For the critical?

412
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:02,879
MATT: Yeah.

413
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:05,930
VIN: Ooh!

414
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,747
MATT: Double both dice.

415
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:11,838
VIN: Yeah. That would be 26 plus--

416
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,119
LAURA: Three.

417
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,789
MATT: So 29 point of damage. How do you want to do
this? This is your finishing blow on this one hag.

418
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,498
Describe how you want to do this death blow.

419
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:28,949
VIN: Oh my god. This death blow's just so
delicious. Can I throw a little spin in it?

420
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:31,610
MATT: That's what I'm saying. Go ahead and
describe how you want the death blow to be.

421
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:42,199
VIN: Guys, stand back! This is going to get
really-- I literally have to throw a spin on it

422
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:51,188
because that's what Kaulder would do. My first one
is a beautiful swipe and as I spin, I reposition

423
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:54,720
my sword and lunge deep into the heart.

424
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,600
MATT: Second strike cuts through the front of the
torso. You can see her ribcage exposed as her upper body's having

425
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:04,088
a hard time keeping its physical form. Strange
spirits begin to streak out of her chest screaming.

426
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:13,894
She reels back, "Kaulder!" reaching forward on the
blade as you've brought the hilt up. You can feel

427
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:16,473
that cold crimson spill over the front of your
hand.

428
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:17,561
VIN: Beautiful.

429
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:21,519
MATT: Her face is in yours. You can see the eyes
twitching as life beings to leave her form. "There

430
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,665
"are more. They will find you!"

431
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:28,153
VIN: Silence!

432
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:34,680
MATT: As you push in, her breath escapes the
throat, her eyes fall back and the body falls limp

433
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,423
against your grasp. You draw the blade out,
flicking blood off, some of it onto the

434
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:47,234
Headmistress and Grog. The other hag, who had just
revealed her image, goes, "Another time, then."

435
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:52,961
Backs out, seemingly very frightened by the fact
that you just instantaneously disabled her

436
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:54,005
sister.

437
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,878
LAURA: Yeah, run!

438
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:57,421
MATT: Disappears into the darkness. The moonlight
creeps in again as the shadow that seemed to

439
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:02,225
consume the vicinity seems to fade. You're now
left amongst these cold ruins. The tension and

440
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:09,804
curse seemingly now vanishing. The light and
liveliness of the local fauna and greenery slowly

441
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,736
returning around you.

442
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:14,989
VIN: We have done some good.

443
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:17,741
LAURA: And we got the money up front.

444
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:19,474
JESSICA: Always ask for it up front.

445
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:22,515
TRAVIS: I never liked the old woman, I'm just
saying.

446
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:30,695
MATT: As your merry band of mercenaries head back
towards the city of Brombog, you are greeted by

447
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:37,525
the remainder of the partially insane, but very
grateful survivors of this recent curse. They come

448
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:42,077
out to you. The rest of the money they collected
amounts to about 320 gold pieces as well as a

449
00:28:42,077 --> 00:28:46,636
handful of currently unidentified magical
artifacts that you keep at your side for future

450
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,364
identification.

451
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:49,805
LAURA: Gimme.

452
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:55,260
MATT: That's for you guys to decide. As you step
out of the bog, with a sense of accomplishment, the

453
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,386
five of you look on to consider 1. Where your next
venture will be, and 2. Where this other hag may

454
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:06,269
be wandering off to possibly set another trap and
gain vengeance for the death of her sister. And

455
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:09,045
that, my friends, concludes our adventure for
today.

456
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:12,555
(cheering)

457
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:17,041
MATT: As Kaulder and his band of mercenaries left
the small, saved, cleansed village of Bronbog,

458
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:24,636
they went out into the night air. What adventures
did this world hold in store?

459
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:45,961
