1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,659
(laughing)

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,101
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role! Where a bunch of us

3
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:09,617
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, play Dungeons
and Dragons, and shout obscenities a little late.

4
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:13,079
LAURA: Did it make it?

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,820
MATT: We'll find out, I'm sure.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,976
LAURA: We'll find out.

7
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:19,356
MATT: Anyway, glad you guys could join us for
tonight. Tonight is not a typical episode, we are

8
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:22,635
missing two of our cast members, and since we're
in the throes of an interesting narrative, we

9
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:26,890
wanted to push that off for a week. Next week we
return with Vox Machina's normal narrative as well

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,509
as Jon Heder as a guest, which is going to be a
lot of fun!

11
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:31,226
(cheering)

12
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:35,875
MATT: However, this week, for the five members
that we do have, we are going to have a

13
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:41,846
fantastical Battle Royale. A Level 17 Battle
Royale. The power level has definitely jumped

14
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:47,414
since the last time we had one of these, I'm
curious to see how it pans out. Should be fun.

15
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:51,688
LAURA: By the way, I saw voting-- there was a poll
to see who they thought would win.

16
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,094
MATT: Don't say anything yet! Hold off on that.
Hold off on that.

17
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:56,494
LAURA: Okay.

18
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:58,864
MARISHA: I wonder how many people are going to
lose money on us tonight.

19
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:04,360
SAM: Travis, you have something-- yes, right,
right there.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,410
TRAVIS: Where? Right here?

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,306
SAM: Yeah, right there. There's a little
something.

22
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:08,282
TRAVIS: Did I get it?

23
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,610
SAM: Yup.

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:18,498
MATT: Anyway. So yeah, so real fast, just to get
through our brief announcements for the day. Me,

25
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:23,568
Marisha, Taliesin, and Brian Foster will be flying
out tomorrow, early, to Atlanta to join you guys

26
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:26,554
at MomoCon. We've been talking about it for a few
weeks here. We have a Talks Machina panel on

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,268
Saturday. Signings. Other fun events, so please
come join us if you're going to be out in that

28
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:39,501
vicinity. Next week after that a bunch of us are
going to be at the Stream of Annihilation, a

29
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:44,730
stream up at Seattle with the D&D folks, along
with a bunch of other awesome D&D groups and

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:52,592
streamers, High Rollers guys. We've got Curse of Strahd
folk. A bunch of just really awesome people coming

31
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:56,678
up. We're going to be playing with some folks, I
might be running a game, it will be fun. But look

32
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,002
forward to seeing you guys there. Check us out.
We'll have more information to come out soon. Then

33
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:03,067
the week after that, I'm going to be at A-Kon in
Dallas.

34
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,367
Because I apparently don't like having
weekends.

35
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,197
TRAVIS: Are you allergic?

36
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:12,533
MATT: I need to work on that. Planning is a
problem, it catches up to you. But anyway, I'll be

37
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:17,183
out there for that in Dallas, Texas. Hope to see
you guys that weekend. What else? What else do

38
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:19,052
people want to talk about?

39
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:23,541
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have our
Wednesday Club this Wednesday. I think we're going

40
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,496
to do Wonder Woman. We were having a straw poll,
where I think we're going to be talking about

41
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,874
Wonder Woman.

42
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:29,914
TRAVIS: That's kind of irrelevant right now, right?

43
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:35,401
TALIESIN: Yeah, we don't normally veer relevant,
but we figure this is kind of a big deal so, you

44
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,784
know, and it's an interesting conversation.

45
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:40,447
SAM: Have you ever done an episode about Groo the
Wanderer?

46
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:44,405
TALIESIN: No, but I know of Groo. We don't know
Groo well enough to really delve in.

47
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:47,402
SAM: If you do an episode on Groo, that's the one
I'll watch.

48
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:49,379
TALIESIN: Not the one you'll be on?

49
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,100
SAM: No, no, no. I'll watch it, though.

50
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,108
TALIESIN: You'll watch it, then?

51
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:53,717
SAM: Yeah, yeah. I'm not going to go on your show.

52
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:54,591
TALIESIN: Okay.

53
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,150
(laughter)

54
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,673
SAM: I could bring my comic collection on your
show! And show it off!

55
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,473
TRAVIS: You have a comic collection?

56
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:01,896
SAM: Yeah, man!

57
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,363
TRAVIS: More than ten? More than ten comics?

58
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,950
SAM: Yeah, I've got some good books, man.

59
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,056
TALIESIN: You gave me that really good comic book
for-- was it Christmas last year? Or the year

60
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,016
before, because I read it in Colorado, it was
really nice.

61
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,415
MATT: Save your rolls, Laura.

62
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:13,612
LAURA: I had to test it!

63
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,016
MATT: I know. I know you do.

64
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:16,666
LAURA: That was the Joe-dice.

65
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,284
MATT: Oh! There you go!

66
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,376
LAURA: He's making it into the battle.

67
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,933
MATT: There you go. You need to know who's in your
corner, Laura.

68
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,484
LAURA: That's right.

69
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:30,480
MATT: All righty, guys. If we don't have anything
else to discuss, we're going to go ahead and dive

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,517
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

71
00:03:37,517 --> 00:05:03,382
[dramatic music]

72
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:09,368
MATT: All right, and welcome back, everybody! So
as part of tonight's Battle Royale, a couple of

73
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,695
things that I want to put out there. One: because
we're at higher power levels, it may go quickly.

74
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:24,160
If it goes quickly, we may do a second round.
Which, keep in mind, whatever alliances or

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,649
betrayals you endure that first round will
probably be remembered for the second.

76
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,304
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait! Were we supposed to make
alliances?!

77
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,920
SAM: Oh yeah, we all made alliances. We all made
alliances, Laura.

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,544
(laughter)

79
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,680
SAM: It's all four of us against you.

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,227
TRAVIS: Yeah, raise your hand if you're on Team
Right.

81
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:42,586
MARISHA: Table Right!

82
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:44,081
MATT: Laura, have you played Risk?

83
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,240
LAURA: Yes.

84
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,708
MATT: Risk is a game where you make alliances and
then double-cross people. It doesn't say it in the

85
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:56,018
rules, but that's how it always happens. That's
what I assume will probably happen. It may not!

86
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:59,805
You guys may surprise me! I'm just saying, be
prepared.

87
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:02,570
LAURA and TRAVIS: (singing) Be prepared!

88
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,865
MATT: (laughing) Okay, now I'm voting for that
table! All right, guys, the other thing I want to

89
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:14,646
mention is, whoever the victor is will get a minor
prize. A very, very minor prize.

90
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:18,247
LAURA: What is it?! Do we get to know what it is?

91
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,301
TALIESIN: A Nintendo Switch!

92
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:28,080
MATT: PlayStation 2. No. You will get a fate die
that you get to carry over

93
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,291
into the main campaign.

94
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,573
It's a single reroll.

95
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:34,340
SAM: That could come in handy.

96
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,140
MATT: It's like a Luck point.

97
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,123
TRAVIS: Well fuck! No! My lighthearted self is now
changed!

98
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:43,735
LAURA: You already have fate dice! You have a
fucking Deck of Many Things. You have an entire

99
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:45,397
plethora of fate dice.

100
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:49,053
TRAVIS: That is not the same. There's like a seven
percent chance I even pull

101
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,653
something even close to that.

102
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,599
TALIESIN: I'm with Travis on this one. It's just
not the same. No.

103
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,317
TRAVIS: That's a big prize!

104
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:59,479
LAURA: Enjoy the fate die, Keyleth or Grog.

105
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,712
TRAVIS: Yeah, like when you choose to become a
goldfish from a thousand feet.

106
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:07,581
MARISHA: Yeah, that would have been great. To have
then. Mm-hm. So clutch.

107
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:12,070
TALIESIN: Is this your first Battle Royale? So,
what happens though, is that the people who are

108
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,572
obviously the problem often get targeted first.
And then it'll be other people who somehow have

109
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,938
all their hit points in Round Four.

110
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:24,139
SAM: Oh, that's happening, guys. You're going to
forget I existed.

111
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,498
MARISHA: Mr. Loot-Drop over here.

112
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:32,411
TALIESIN: Mr. Loot-Drop may go down early.

113
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,389
TRAVIS: Mr. Care-Package.

114
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:44,559
MATT: As you all comfortably find yourself
resting, falling into sleep and darkness for the

115
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:53,653
evening, in the city of Whitestone, over some
point in the break of the year-long period. You

116
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:58,178
find yourself-- Your eyes opening; bleary,
blinking, towards what appears to be a grey

117
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:03,988
cloud-covered sky. You look about and find
yourselves somewhat scattered amongst an

118
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:10,351
unfamiliar battlefield. Travis, I want you to go
ahead and roll a d6 for me, please.

119
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,563
TRAVIS: Oh God. Okay!

120
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:15,694
LAURA: This is serious! This is serious!

121
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,070
TRAVIS: A two.

122
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,390
MATT: A two. Okay.

123
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,144
LAURA: Oh my God! I was just looking at the
top-view, I didn't realize that

124
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:25,515
those are fucking towers!

125
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:27,535
MATT: Yeah, so that's you there.

126
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:29,018
TRAVIS: Okay. Okay.

127
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:31,261
MATT: Laura. Go ahead and roll a d6.

128
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,453
LAURA: (panting) Okay! Six!

129
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:41,367
MATT: A six! With Trinket there.

130
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,230
LAURA: Oh God. Oh, with Trinket up there!

131
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,793
MARISHA: Exactly where the ranger should be.

132
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:49,956
MATT: All right, Marisha, roll a d6.

133
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:53,670
SAM: First roll of the night!

134
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,107
MARISHA: Four.

135
00:08:55,107 --> 00:09:03,199
MATT: Four. All righty. Taliesin?

136
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,139
TALIESIN: Four.

137
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,657
MATT: Roll again.

138
00:09:06,657 --> 00:09:09,097
TALIESIN: Three.

139
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:15,137
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d6.

140
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,429
SAM: One.

141
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,202
LAURA: Look at us, spreading out our numbers!

142
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:32,927
MATT: All righty, so as you take in the scenery
around you, seemingly no rhyme or reason. You

143
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:38,663
wonder how you transported to this space. Taryon
in particular, you find that you seem to be a

144
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:45,262
little more viable power than you were when you
went to bed that night. You watch as a singular

145
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:52,843
cloaked figure seems to emerge from the clouds
above you and slowly fall from the sky. As the

146
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:59,755
entity, you see arms out, hood up, the wind
blowing around causing the cloth to flap and curl

147
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:02,941
about them. The hood blows back, and you see
before you, a--

148
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:04,555
SAM: It's me, Vax.

149
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,025
(laughter)

150
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:14,582
SAM: Hey everybody, I can fly 200,000 feet in one
second.

151
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:22,669
MATT: So, if we ever do a live-action Vox Machina
film, we get Owen Wilson to play Vax. So, as the

152
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:27,438
figure descends to about this point in the center
of the battlefield, you watch as the wind blows the

153
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:34,492
hood back, and you see there a handsome man with
immaculate, somewhat ear-length brown hair, and a

154
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:42,488
magnificent beard. As he smiles and looks around
and goes: "Tonight, you fight for me and my

155
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:48,059
"pleasure. For I am the forgotten deity, known as
Colville!"

156
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:54,421
(laughter)

157
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:58,536
MATT: "And you will dance before me. And between
you all, one victor shall stand and gain my

158
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:08,167
"blessing." At which point, he raises his hand, and
you watch as a force field of energy suddenly

159
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:14,532
(whoosh) warps around and encapsulates around it,
also zeroing off the top about there. So there is

160
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:21,742
a height limit to this chamber. Right across
there. About 20 feet up

161
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:24,540
from the base of this tower.

162
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,755
SAM: Which are 30 feet tall, 20 feet tall?

163
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,392
MATT: These are 30 feet tall.

164
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:29,895
MARISHA: So about 50 feet up.

165
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:38,885
MATT: 50 feet up, yeah. You watch as he grins and
smiles. "I hope you all learn something. Now, you

166
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:46,506
"have six seconds to decide where to go and what to
prepare for. No fighting is to commence until

167
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:52,158
"these six seconds are up. And then... Show me what
you've got!"

168
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:55,061
(laughter)

169
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,330
LAURA: So wait, we can cast things in these six
seconds?

170
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,602
MATT: You can cast or prepare anything you want
to, an action or movement or bonus, that doesn't

171
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:06,682
attack or assault another person, for the first
round, but first! Let's roll initiative, guys.

172
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,694
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

173
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,228
TALIESIN: Yeah.

174
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:13,221
SAM: I'm feeling lucky? That's terrible.

175
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,832
MATT: All righty.

176
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:17,588
SAM: That's one Luck down.

177
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:19,599
MATT: So, 25 to 20?

178
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,270
TALIESIN: 29.

179
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,901
TRAVIS: What the fuck, man?

180
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:29,551
TALIESIN: Ain't gonna have a repeat of last
time.

181
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,871
MATT: All righty. (laughs) That's right, yeah.

182
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,973
TALIESIN: I was just low enough, if I had been
above Liam, that would have been the end of him,

183
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:36,749
but he hid.

184
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:38,844
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

185
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:39,889
LAURA: 19.

186
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:40,818
TRAVIS: 16.

187
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:41,987
MARISHA: 16.

188
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:49,051
MATT: Okay. Vex, and then Keyleth and Grog.
Interesting.

189
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:51,048
SAM: You need a tie breaker?

190
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:56,544
MATT: I think so. I'll have you guys both roll
dexterity checks for me, please. Just roll a d20--

191
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,564
TRAVIS: Just normal dex rolls? Or just straight
up?

192
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:00,264
MATT: Just roll a d20, and add your dex modifier.

193
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:03,009
TRAVIS: Okay. 20.

194
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,421
MARISHA: Four.

195
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:14,891
MATT: So we have Vex, then Grog-Keyleth! All
righty, and then Tary!

196
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:16,799
SAM: Oh, sorry, nine.

197
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,783
MATT: All righty. Which, by the way, you also
have--

198
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:20,990
SAM: Doty!

199
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,067
MATT: Doty at your disposal at the top.

200
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,218
SAM: Yes.

201
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,549
MARISHA: Are you at the top of the tower too?

202
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,371
SAM: I'm on that tower. She's on the other tower.

203
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:32,784
LAURA: Wait a minute, here's my question. Did we
see where everybody landed? Could we see

204
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:37,679
everybody, when we came down? Or did we just see
the guy?

205
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,286
MATT: You guys just saw the guy, and you just got
your vision around, so this round is going to be

206
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:47,134
running and taking in your surroundings, and doing
what you're going to do to prepare. From where you

207
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:52,308
are right now, you can barely see somebody. We'll
say as part of this round,

208
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,525
you guys get a feel for it.

209
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:55,857
MARISHA: As part of this round we what?

210
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:59,219
MATT: You get a feel for where everyone else is,
as part of this first round.

211
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:02,795
TRAVIS: On the towers, on the far ends of the map,
is there a back entrance to the tower,

212
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:03,995
or just the door?

213
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:08,160
MATT: Just the doors there, or climbing upward, and
there appears to be a trapdoor on either side.

214
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:09,443
TRAVIS: Going up?

215
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:12,317
MATT: There's a ladder, ladder, and a chain.

216
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:16,996
LAURA: When he said you have six seconds, I
immediately duck down and cast Pass Without a

217
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:18,750
Trace on myself and Trinket.

218
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,408
MATT: Okay, so, we'll get to your turn; Percival,
you're up first.

219
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:28,819
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate the Boots of
Spider Climbing. Should knock that out. I'm going

220
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:34,706
to charge Diplomacy. And then I'm going to--

221
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,372
TRAVIS: Can't hide.

222
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,707
SAM: What, is that a rule?

223
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:40,881
TRAVIS: No, I'm just talking shit.

224
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,414
TALIESIN: I ain't hiding.

225
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,593
SAM: I'm hiding.

226
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:49,764
TALISIN: I'm going to climb up to the top of that
building that's right over there.

227
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,409
MATT: Which one? This one?

228
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:52,951
TALIESIN: That little hut.

229
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,438
MATT: Okay, so you climb up.

230
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:55,654
MARISHA: Is that a hut, is that what those are?

231
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,993
MATT: They're little stone bunker-like
structures. There's an entrance on this side and

232
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,532
on this side.

233
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,015
MARISHA: Shit.

234
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:07,061
TALIESIN: Actually, how far-- I have a--
(counting) six, one, two, three, four, five--

235
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,502
MARISHA: It's like a paintball arena.

236
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,150
MATT: So, it's half your movement, that's 15 feet,
you can move 15 more feet if you want to.

237
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,146
TALIESIN: Yeah, let me get just one step back or
so.

238
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:19,447
MATT: There?

239
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:22,591
TALIESIN: Still at the edge, on the other side,
though. To your right.

240
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:25,661
MATT: Okay, here? Okay. So there you are.

241
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:28,358
TALIESIN: Yeah, and boots are activated, Diplomacy
is activated.

242
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:32,730
MATT: Boots are activated, Diplomacy is activated.
Perfect. All right. Just after Percy goes, you

243
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:40,168
watch as all the flickering braziers, the flames
flicker bright. You see these two glowing towers

244
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:44,337
that are slowly spinning, the blue crystals
(crackling noises) little sparks. And each of

245
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:49,245
these pillars gives off a slight hum. Vex, it's
your turn.

246
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:55,051
LAURA: It's like a trapped thing? This is so
Hunger Games. Oh shit! Okay. I'm going to cast

247
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:59,508
Pass Without a Trace on me and Trinket. And I'm
going to send him down-- Is there a trapdoor or

248
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,838
like a stairway around? That he can go down?

249
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,830
MATT: There is a trapdoor that he can go down and
then make his way.

250
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,855
LAURA: He's going to make his way down. But I am
going to hide, at the top here,

251
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:09,296
behind one of those--

252
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:14,337
MATT: Behind one of those? Okay. Go ahead and make
a stealth check. And Trinket makes it-- We'll say

253
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:20,699
halfway down the tunnel with Trinket's full
movement, there. So down the stairs and he's

254
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:23,050
halfway through the tower there.

255
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,108
LAURA: So my stealth is 30.

256
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:29,779
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Nobody else has any idea
where you are right now.

257
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:30,650
LAURA: Solid.

258
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:36,437
MATT: At the moment. All right, that brings us to
Grog.

259
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:45,686
TRAVIS: (grunts) I would like to rage! Just, oh,
so angry! I don't like people putting me in

260
00:16:45,686 --> 00:17:03,825
strange places and floating down from the clouds,
<i>Colville.</i> Can I equip-- yeah, fuck it. Fuck it.

261
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:07,489
I'm going to stick with the Bloodaxe. Not the
Dwarven Thrower.

262
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,399
MATT: Okay, Bloodaxe. Oof.

263
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:16,705
TRAVIS: I know. I know. That might be a poor
choice. Oh, you motherfuckers can fly!

264
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,340
TALIESIN: I can't.

265
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,604
TRAVIS: Bullshit, you're climbing up shit with
spider boots. You know what, no, Dwarven Thrower.

266
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:26,237
Dwarven Thrower, and can I start to climb the
little rope ladder that's next to me?

267
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,133
MATT: Yes, you can, make an athletics check.

268
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:38,994
TRAVIS: I just want to get a good lay of the land!
I don't even know anybody's up there! 15.

269
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,027
SAM: The glasses are clutch.

270
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,340
MATT: You rage, get up, and just crest over the
top.

271
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:46,446
LAURA: Oh shit, you're already there!

272
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:54,109
SAM: (screaming) He sleeps in war paint?! Why would
he sleep in war paint?!

273
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:59,666
MATT: He rage-climbs the ladder. One rung over the
other, and with the rest of his movement gets to

274
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,997
the very top of the tower.

275
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,781
TRAVIS: Do I have a bonus action?

276
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,647
MATT: Well, your bonus action was rage.

277
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:06,743
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, never mind.

278
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:09,546
MATT: If you have an action you want to do that
doesn't involve attacking or hurting anybody--

279
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,491
TRAVIS: I blow a snot rocket when I get to the
top.

280
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:16,995
MATT: Okay. You watch as a large globule of
goliath snot slaps the ground in front of you, and

281
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,313
skids a bit, leaving a trail.

282
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:20,693
SAM: Oh, man.

283
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:21,668
TRAVIS: Dexterity check.

284
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,185
SAM: It's like a cicada.

285
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:27,712
(laughter)

286
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:30,760
MATT: All right. Is that your turn, Grog? Keyleth,
you're up.

287
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:41,332
MARISHA: Oh, god. It begins. Can I just run up,
and just check that water right in front of me?

288
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:46,509
And really fast, put my foot in it and see if I
can see how deep it goes?

289
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:47,776
LAURA: And you die.

290
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,261
TRAVIS: No, no, let her do it.

291
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:53,475
MARISHA: Let me take my staff. And just put my
staff down a little bit.

292
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:59,867
MATT: Okay. Your staff dips down and it goes
about-- It keeps going. It's pretty deep.

293
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:01,166
MARISHA: It's pretty deep?

294
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,715
MATT: To the point where you get, like, to the very
edge of your staff, holding it there, and it

295
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:06,235
manages to go all the way in.

296
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:08,091
MARISHA: Oh, I touch the bottom now, though?

297
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:11,241
MATT: Yeah. Well, you haven't felt the bottom yet,
any more and you're

298
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:13,541
going to submerge your hands.

299
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:18,715
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to cast Freedom of
Movement on myself. And then can I move around to

300
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:26,161
this side, here-ish? This side here-ish. Over
here. And hide.

301
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:31,670
MATT: And move over this way? Well, you're not
hiding, you don't have anything left to do a hide

302
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,979
action, but you move there.

303
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:33,800
MARISHA: That's fine.

304
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,895
MATT: Okay. All right. So, Taryon.

305
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:38,386
SAM: Everyone else has gone?

306
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,508
MATT: Yeah.

307
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:40,909
SAM: I have a lot to do.

308
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,019
MATT: All right, what are you doing?

309
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,296
SAM: Number one, how much does Doty weigh?

310
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:49,750
MATT: At his size, I'd say he weighs somewhere in
the range of 700 pounds.

311
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,746
SAM: Fuck. That changes things.

312
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:57,202
MATT: He is somewhat hollow in places, though.

313
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:59,449
TRAVIS: Build him out of aluminium?

314
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:05,849
MATT: No. He's large and he's heavy, metallic
substances, but he is hollow in places, so I'd

315
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:09,337
actually say he's probably closer to 500 maybe.
400 to 500.

316
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:21,528
SAM: Still, anything over 400 bones my strategy so
it's okay. We're okay. Plan number two. Okay. I

317
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:30,990
say, Doty! I need you to carry me away from all
the bad people. Remember how we played keep-away

318
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,415
as children? We're playing that now. Keep me away
from everybody.

319
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,182
MATT: "Tary."

320
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:46,254
SAM: Yes. I cast Sanctuary on Doty. I think I can
do that. Yeah? Okay. And then for my action I will

321
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:52,369
throw down the Bead of Force on myself and enclose
myself in the bubble.

322
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:57,905
MARISHA: You're going to be a guy in a hamster
ball being carried around by robot?

323
00:20:57,905 --> 00:21:00,004
SAM: I take 5d4 damage.

324
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,444
LAURA: That's pretty smart.

325
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:02,537
MARISHA: It's pretty awesome.

326
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:03,768
TRAVIS: You take 5d4 damage?

327
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:05,464
LAURA: Just putting yourself in the ball?

328
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,689
SAM: Uh-huh.

329
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:09,958
LAURA: That's smart, you know what? And then we
can't hurt you.

330
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,768
SAM: Not for a minute.

331
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:13,068
LAURA: Oh shit!

332
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:16,790
SAM: I got ten rounds, y'all. See ya!

333
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,521
MARISHA: Is it totally invulnerable type of shit?

334
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:20,679
SAM: Yes.

335
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,118
LAURA: Unless somebody can dispel it or
something?

336
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:26,468
MATT: Only breathable air can pass through the
sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.

337
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:36,671
SAM: It says no magic can pass within or without
the space, it doesn't say that I can't do magic in

338
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,682
the sphere, it just says it can't leave the
sphere.

339
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:44,300
MATT: Correct. So you can cast things on yourself
within, but nothing can pass by. However, you are

340
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:48,132
at the mercy of whoever has control of the ball at
the moment. So yes.

341
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,502
MARISHA: So wait, but you can't cast spells out
either?

342
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:53,334
TRAVIS: You ever see those sporting events where
the beach ball's just going

343
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:54,748
around the fucking crowd?

344
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:57,753
LAURA: So wait. Only air can pass through it,
huh?

345
00:21:57,753 --> 00:22:01,085
SAM: Breathable air. Not poison air.

346
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:05,695
MARISHA: If I was an air elemental, could I go
into the sphere? Just conjecturing.

347
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:09,043
MATT: I don't know if you're considered breathable
as an air elemental.

348
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:13,750
MARISHA: Yeah. But I'm a breath of fresh air.

349
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,387
MATT: Taryon, as you slam into the ground, how
much damage do you take?

350
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:27,282
SAM: I'll roll. Six, seven, eight. Nine points of
damage.

351
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:31,271
MATT: That's not too bad. You take nine points of
damage, and the sphere encapsulates you and you

352
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:41,888
begin to roll forward slightly as Doty walks over,
grabs you, and pulls you back about there to the

353
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:45,073
edge. Not sure what to do, he's just holding you
now in this ball.

354
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,505
SAM: Sure.

355
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:57,239
MATT: "Tary?" Confused. All right. At the end of
that turn, you watch over as Colville, floating in

356
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:05,847
the center, goes, "And now, my champions! Let the
fight begin!" Slams his hands together and you watch

357
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:14,770
him vanish in a burst of thunder as it cracks
around the landscape. And you feel this energy

358
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,873
pulse you all at once as the battle has begun.
Percival, you're up first.

359
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:20,584
TALIESIN: Who can I see?

360
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:24,245
SAM: Grog's head.

361
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:30,948
MATT: You can barely see part of Grog with
three-quarters cover. Barely.

362
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:33,142
TALIESIN: I can barely see Grog with
three-quarters cover.

363
00:23:33,142 --> 00:23:37,437
MATT: Everyone else looks apparently at the moment
not really in your line of sight.

364
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:41,697
TALIESIN: That's fine. That's my first shot then.
Let's just take a couple shots at Grog.

365
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:43,091
MATT: Okay.

366
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:50,907
TALIESIN: You know, if you hadn't made it all the way
up that tower you'd be in intense trouble right

367
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,557
now. Okay, just pointing that out.

368
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,128
MATT: You have Sharpshooter, so you ignore
three-quarters cover.

369
00:23:55,128 --> 00:24:03,975
TALIESIN: Yeah, I ignore three-quarters-- Let's do
first shot with Animus. That's a 29 to hit.

370
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,625
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that hits.

371
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,647
TALIESIN: That hits? All right. Let's just roll
all three first.

372
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,191
MATT: Go for it, yeah.

373
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:15,338
TALIESIN: Oh! No. And then the second one is a
misfire.

374
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:17,666
LAURA, MARISHA: Oh my God!

375
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,195
TRAVIS: Like, gun-break misfire?

376
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:27,485
TALIESIN: Gun-break misfire. It's gun-break
misfire. That's okay. Yeah, so I'll just take my

377
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:31,029
third shot with Bad News. Just for fun.

378
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:33,830
MATT: Okay, go for it.

379
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,442
TALIESIN: 20 to hit.

380
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:40,610
MATT: Yeah, that hits. All right, so-- One Animus
shot, and then one Bad News shot.

381
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,623
TALIESIN: One Animus shot, one Bad News shot. And
I also take, really quickly,

382
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:44,939
I take a little damage.

383
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:46,505
MATT: You take 2d6 psychic, right?

384
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:55,559
TALIESIN: 2d6 psychic damage. Five, six, seven.
Seven points of psychic damage. Did I-- No. It

385
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:00,483
doesn't matter anyway, because I was going to call
Hex, but I'll do it later. Fuck it. All right.

386
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:04,657
Let's roll. I'm also going to run some Cabal's
Ruin into this, just for fun.

387
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:05,688
MATT: Okay.

388
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:07,695
TALIESIN: So, let's do the first one, is 1d10.

389
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:12,451
MATT: So, do Cabal's Ruin damage at the end
because that is not halved.

390
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:23,293
TALIESIN: Yeah. So, 1d10 plus 1d6. So, first shot
is ten points of piercing damage and four points

391
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:24,751
of psychic damage.

392
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:29,088
MATT: Ten points of piercing damage, so that's
reduced to five. And then how many points of

393
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,632
psychic? Four points of psychic. Seven points of
damage.

394
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:35,086
TALIESIN: Then, the Bad News is--

395
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:41,871
MATT: Wait. Ten points-- it's nine. It was ten
points piercing reduced to five and then four

396
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:43,043
psychic. So that's nine.

397
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,993
TRAVIS: Oh, and the psychic's not reduced,
that's right.

398
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:55,870
TALIESIN: So, that's cocked. That's seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11. 17 points of piercing damage.

399
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:59,879
MATT: Okay, so take that down to eight.

400
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:09,735
TALIESIN: And let's just-- three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine. This is not halved, is it?

401
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,921
MATT: Nope!

402
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:12,493
TRAVIS: The psychic?

403
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:15,891
MATT: No, this is Cabal's Ruin. He's pumping you
full of lightning damage.

404
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:21,389
TALIESIN: I'm going to empty Cabal's Ruin into
him.

405
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:25,572
MATT: Okay! That's how many d6s?

406
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:26,536
TALIESIN: 10d6.

407
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:29,630
MATT: 10d6 lightning damage to you, Grog!

408
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,976
TRAVIS: Ones!

409
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:32,400
SAM: Lot of ones.

410
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,280
(laughing)

411
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,817
TALIESIN: Six, 15, 20.

412
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:41,885
SAM: It's all threes and fours.

413
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:43,133
LAURA: I'm so nervous.

414
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,452
MARISHA: Me too.

415
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:46,531
TALIESIN: 33 points of lightning damage.

416
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,623
TRAVIS: 33.

417
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:54,354
MATT: There you go. All right, Percival, and you
have movement. And a bonus, if you want.

418
00:26:54,354 --> 00:26:59,302
TALIESIN: I'm not going to blow my bonus for now,
but I am going to run down and across towards that

419
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:01,508
tower towards you.

420
00:27:01,508 --> 00:27:07,535
MATT: Over here? That's 30 right there, right?

421
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:11,510
SAM: There's like six cameras in front of us.

422
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,803
TALIESIN: As far that way as I can go.

423
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:16,450
MATT: Fair enough. All right, so, end of
Percival's turn.

424
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,863
LAURA: Oh! Oh! Are there lair actions?

425
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:25,752
MATT: There are lair actions on this battlefield.

426
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,578
TALIESIN: Is there a door, by the way, in that
thing?

427
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:28,805
MATT: There's a door right there.

428
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,161
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll eventually be heading towards
that.

429
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:36,613
MATT: Okay. Well, as you're running by it,
Percival, you hear that low hum (humming) begins

430
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:42,356
to (humming intensifies). Spin up, you hear this
crackling noise. And you watch as each of these

431
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:47,627
four towers suddenly gives off this intense
vibration around it. As you're walking, you feel

432
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:53,472
this force pulling on you, like being within a
certain radius of this is forcing you to move

433
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,527
slower (grunting). That's all. Vex, your turn.

434
00:27:58,527 --> 00:28:04,651
LAURA: Okay, I can see Grog as well, because I'm
assuming his head is above those parapets?

435
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,627
MATT: Yes. He does have half-cover from you
currently.

436
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:08,594
LAURA: I have Sharpshooter, so he does not.

437
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:09,464
MATT: All right!

438
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:11,595
LAURA: I'm going to send Trinket down.

439
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:15,797
MATT: So, Trinket does manage to get all the way
to the bottom and emerges from the front door

440
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:18,046
there, but that's as far as Trinket can get with
his movement.

441
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,615
LAURA: Trinket's like (confused bear sound).

442
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,255
TRAVIS: Aren't you concerned with the love of your
life running across the courtyard?

443
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:26,664
LAURA: I can't see him! He's hidden, like from my
field of view, I'm assuming I can't really see

444
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,675
him. Can I see Percy?

445
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:31,875
MATT: Percy? Yeah, you can see Percy from there.

446
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:40,576
LAURA: I'm going to still shoot Grog. Yeah, I'm
going to shoot Grog twice. Once with the Blazing

447
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:48,312
Bowstring, and we're just going to see how that
goes. Aww man! 17.

448
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:50,432
TRAVIS: That is my AC.

449
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:54,244
LAURA: So it hits! Yes! Oh, shit.

450
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,958
TRAVIS: It's not too hard to hit me!

451
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,638
MATT: You've just got a billion hit points.

452
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:04,127
LAURA: 15. 15 plus four lightning damage.

453
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:05,679
TRAVIS: Okay, halved.

454
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,171
LAURA: Wait, lightning damage is halved?

455
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:10,153
TRAVIS: Mm-hm, I have resistance to lightning
damage.

456
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:11,885
MATT: You do when you go into your large form.

457
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:16,538
TRAVIS: Oh, which I'm not, yet! So 15 halved is
eight, right?

458
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:18,714
LAURA: Okay, and then four lightning damage.

459
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:21,342
MATT: Which is why you didn't halve any of the
Cabal Ruin damage last round.

460
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:25,449
LAURA: And then five points of fire damage.

461
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:26,826
TRAVIS: Okay.

462
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:29,174
LAURA: Damn it, he gets half piercing damage?

463
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,226
MATT: Yeah.

464
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,971
LAURA: Fuck! Okay, I'm going to try it again.

465
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:33,171
MATT: All right.

466
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,870
LAURA: And that's an 18!

467
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,348
MATT: That hits!

468
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:46,938
LAURA: 14 halved is seven. No, wait. Eight,
because it's 16 points of damage.

469
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:48,488
TRAVIS: Okay.

470
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:50,668
LAURA: Plus four lightning damage.

471
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:52,096
TRAVIS: Okay.

472
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:55,783
LAURA: Plus Blazing Bowstring. Seven points of
fire damage.

473
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:56,591
TRAVIS: Okay.

474
00:29:56,591 --> 00:30:01,136
LAURA: And I'm going to use my bonus action. I'm
going to move down a couple parapets towards you

475
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:03,959
and I'm going to keep hiding as my bonus action.

476
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,316
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll a stealth check.

477
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:10,840
LAURA: Do I have to roll if I've got skirmisher
stealth? Or do I just continue to hide? I'm just

478
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,362
wondering how that works.

479
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:16,088
MATT: It's been a while since you used skirmisher
stealth.

480
00:30:16,088 --> 00:30:19,376
LAURA: I know. I don't remember. Yeah, it's a
ranger thing.

481
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:25,611
TRAVIS: This fight started and I'm like (machine
gun fire). The fucking Godfather just

482
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:27,418
(screaming).

483
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:29,318
MATT: Basically. You're not wrong.

484
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:31,824
TALIESIN: I hit you with a ball of lightning, man,
like a Tesla coil.

485
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:36,753
TRAVIS: I climb up to the top of the tower like,
what's going on? (machine gun fire)

486
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:41,438
MATT: At the start of your turn, you pick a
creature to remain hidden from,

487
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:42,860
not a general hiding.

488
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,205
LAURA: Oh, so I could say, I'm keeping hidden from
Percy.

489
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:50,442
MATT: Yep. But everybody else can still see you.

490
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:52,625
LAURA: And then I would roll for stealth to hide
from everybody else?

491
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,175
MATT: If you wanted to make the hide action.

492
00:30:54,175 --> 00:31:03,022
LAURA: I'm going to keep hidden from Percy for
skirmisher stealth, and then I'm going to roll for

493
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:08,171
stealth, and I got a 24 to hide from everybody
else.

494
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:16,299
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Now, you guys are aware
she's there, you just cannot shoot her or attack

495
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:20,090
her from this distance necessarily. All right,
that ends your turn?

496
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,171
LAURA: Yeah.

497
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,703
MATT: Grog. Mr. Pincushion. What are you doing?

498
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:37,884
TRAVIS: I take the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash
them together and I cast Enlarge on myself. Is

499
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:39,474
Doty up there with you?

500
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:42,723
SAM: Oh, sure. He's holding me in a ball.

501
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:44,537
MATT: Like a giant hamster ball.

502
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:49,943
(laughter)

503
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:53,359
TALIESIN: Do it.

504
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,973
LAURA: Is this tee-time?

505
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:59,012
TRAVIS: Can I go into a frenzied rage?

506
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:00,227
MATT: Yeah.

507
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:05,899
TRAVIS: And can I try and shove Doty off of the
top of the tower?

508
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:07,737
MATT: Yes, you may.

509
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:11,775
SAM: You'll have to succeed a wisdom saving throw,
first.

510
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:12,909
MATT: Yes, you do.

511
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:15,869
TRAVIS: My wisdom ain't bad. My intelligence is
dick-all.

512
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,293
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

513
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:21,922
TRAVIS: Okay. 14.

514
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:28,077
MATT: Nope. So you go to shove him, and you go
(groan).

515
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:30,435
TRAVIS: Oh, because he's got Sanctuary on
himself!

516
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:32,365
LAURA: That's what Earthbreaker Groon had!

517
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:34,080
MATT: Yep. That's what Earthbreaker Groon did to
you.

518
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,386
TRAVIS: Understood.

519
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:39,127
SAM: You can still make the attack, you just have
to point it at someone else.

520
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:43,552
TRAVIS: Interesting. I choose to urinate all
over-- no.

521
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:47,918
TALIESIN: Does the ball count as someone else, or
just Doty?

522
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:50,171
MATT: You can attack the ball, but it does
nothing.

523
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,990
SAM: Well, it'll throw me away.

524
00:32:51,990 --> 00:33:01,724
TRAVIS: Interesting, interesting. I don't learn
lessons very well. I'm going to try again. One

525
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,618
more time. I get three attacks, so.

526
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,150
MATT: Okay. So you're going to do the second shove
attack.

527
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,533
TRAVIS: Yep.

528
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,188
MATT: Wisdom save.

529
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,421
TRAVIS: 17?

530
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,171
SAM: I mean, that's it. DC 17.

531
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:20,510
MATT: Okay, so now getting Doty's sheet out here.
For a shove attack, I believe it's a contested

532
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,412
athletics check, let me double-check real fast.

533
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:25,192
TRAVIS: Okay. Not strength, but athletics?

534
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:31,962
MATT: Pretty sure. I'm sure the Internet right now
is going, "No, it's this! God damn it, Mercer!"

535
00:33:31,962 --> 00:33:39,002
No, it's athletics contested by athletics, so go
ahead and roll an athletics check, Grog. With

536
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:41,849
advantage, because you're raging.

537
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:44,058
TRAVIS: That's higher.

538
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:49,571
MATT: Roll a d20, add four. For Doty.

539
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:51,442
SAM: 14.

540
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:52,812
TRAVIS: 24.

541
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:58,014
SAM: (Goofy-style screaming)

542
00:33:58,014 --> 00:34:05,772
MATT: You watch as Doty turns to Grog, goes,
"Tary?" (bang) and end over end gets shoved off

543
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:15,464
the parapet, slamming onto the ground, prone here
at the bottom of the chain. You, Taryon, fly off

544
00:34:15,464 --> 00:34:22,669
(boing) harmlessly and roll into the middle of the
pool, and are currently now on your side.

545
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:28,117
SAM: Floating? Is it like at Ren Faire? I'm in one
of those balls!

546
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:40,243
MATT: For the 30-foot fall, Doty takes 11 points
of bludgeoning damage.

547
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:41,900
SAM: Still alive, he's fine.

548
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,931
MATT: And is prone. (chuckles)

549
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:47,341
TRAVIS: I have some movement left.

550
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:50,612
MATT: You do. You have 40 feet of movement left.

551
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:53,847
TRAVIS: Right. Is there a trap door at the top of
the tower?

552
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:54,865
MATT: There is, yes.

553
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:58,114
TRAVIS: Would I need an action or a bonus to be
able to open it? To go down into it?

554
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:01,080
MATT: It would be an action to lift it up.

555
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,884
TRAVIS: I have one-- well, I have an attack. Okay.
Can I move to the--

556
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:09,815
MATT: Actually, it's not that much, because it's
not locked or anything. You can probably just pull

557
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:10,774
it open.

558
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:13,068
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to go into the tower
stairs.

559
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:18,322
MATT: Okay. So, with the rest of your movement, 40
feet, you can get almost to the bottom, so you're

560
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:20,525
partway through that.

561
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:21,864
TRAVIS: And I'm still inside, right?

562
00:35:21,864 --> 00:35:22,932
MATT: Yeah, you're still inside.

563
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:24,933
TRAVIS: Great. As long as no one can... yeah.

564
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:30,138
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Grog.
Keyleth. Your turn.

565
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:33,220
TRAVIS: Fucking hamster ball piece of shit.

566
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,530
MATT: That's so awesome!

567
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,940
SAM: I might be alive for a long time after you're
all dead.

568
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:42,742
MARISHA: That's kind of true. Ten rounds, that's a
long fucking time. Okay, question. The radius of

569
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:47,657
the (energy field sound effect). I have Freedom of
Movement, do I seem to not be affected by that?

570
00:35:47,657 --> 00:35:54,983
MATT: You seem to not be affected by it, actually.
You see it there, and as you push forward a little

571
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:59,313
bit with your hand, it doesn't seem to be-- the
gravitational shift isn't affecting you.

572
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:07,030
MARISHA: Cool. I'm going to move up and forward
this direction.

573
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,639
MATT: Up this way?

574
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,295
MARISHA: Yeah, one, two, three, stop right there!

575
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:12,523
MATT: Right there on the edge?

576
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:14,041
MARISHA: Do I see Doty?

577
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:19,982
MATT: You can just barely see the edge of Doty
right past these. You see his head on the ground.

578
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:23,386
You see Taryon in the middle, and you see Percival
right there.

579
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:26,337
LAURA: I like the idea of seeing Tary like...

580
00:36:26,337 --> 00:36:28,302
MARISHA: I can move one more square, correct?

581
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:32,867
MATT: You can move three more squares if you want
to.

582
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:37,517
SAM: The inside of the ball is all puke smeared
everywhere.

583
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:41,559
MARISHA: Okay. Move me up to the doorway, up one
more.

584
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:46,703
MATT: Okay. You can look inside now. You see a
small chamber, and what appears to be a small

585
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:50,575
chest against the wall there, and this area is
just an open space.

586
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,563
LAURA: Oh, fuck, is there loot?

587
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:54,185
TRAVIS: You shut your damn mouth.

588
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:56,328
LAURA: And I'm up top?! Fuck.

589
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:57,729
MARISHA: That's good to know.

590
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:01,076
TALIESIN: You have a beacon. It's a very nice
beacon.

591
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:04,568
LAURA: I do have a beacon. I have a feeling that
beacon is going to attack us.

592
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:05,940
TALIESIN: It's probably going to attack us.

593
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,980
TRAVIS: No! It's so benignly designed.

594
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:17,196
MARISHA: I'm going to, on top of Doty, cast a
5th-level Flaming Sphere.

595
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:26,988
MATT: (laughing) Okay! (boom) So, you watch as,
suddenly, spiraling out of the air, this swirl of

596
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:35,509
fire forms into a large, burning ball of flame
that begins to collide and burn and singe into

597
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:41,827
Doty's (squealing metal) prone form on the ground,
still reeling from the impact of being knocked off

598
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:49,664
the tower. That's 5d6 damage. Go ahead and roll a
dexterity saving throw for Doty. I think it's

599
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:50,867
dexterity, right?

600
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,154
MARISHA: He's prone.

601
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:58,158
MATT: Prone doesn't change your dexterity saving
throw.

602
00:37:58,158 --> 00:38:04,523
SAM: Oh, I rolled a 16, plus dexterity of zero. So
16.

603
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:09,365
MATT: That does not make her DC, unfortunately. So
that's 5d6 points of fire damage against Doty.

604
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:18,254
MARISHA: 18, 20, 21, 22! 22, and then--

605
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,826
MATT: 22 points of fire damage.

606
00:38:19,826 --> 00:38:21,103
SAM: Sure, sure.

607
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:31,297
MARISHA: I don't get any other bonuses, okay. I'm
going to say, sorry, Tary! And then go (whoosh)

608
00:38:31,297 --> 00:38:36,213
and go fire elemental form, and hope that this
isn't a mistake.

609
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,564
TRAVIS: Please be nothing but black powder in the
chest.

610
00:38:39,564 --> 00:38:41,897
MARISHA: Wouldn't hurt me none.

611
00:38:41,897 --> 00:38:52,412
MATT: Just, "Tary?" (explosion) Just a white flash
like Akira opening.

612
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:56,161
MARISHA: Can I do any more movement with my
elemental form?

613
00:38:56,161 --> 00:39:01,740
MATT: You know what? You had ten feet of movement
left.

614
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,993
MARISHA: I'm going to pop into the room.

615
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:11,295
MATT: So I'll say, boom, boom. There you go. So
you flicker inside and you are currently contained

616
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:12,781
on the inside there.

617
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:15,053
LAURA: Ooh, with the roof on there and
everything.

618
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:20,531
MATT: Oh, yeah. It's all sorts of held up there
for you. So, that ends your turn, Keyleth. Taryon.

619
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:26,603
You are floating in a sphere over a pool of murky
green liquid.

620
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:37,655
SAM: End of round one. Okay. Action: Prep my
healing draught. Just pour it into a bottle and

621
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:42,373
get it ready to rock. Bonus: Click my Boots of
Speed.

622
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:44,673
MATT: Boots of Speed, clicked.

623
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:48,181
SAM: Movement: (rapid vibration sound effect)

624
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:52,852
TRAVIS: Like Sonic the Hedgehog?

625
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:57,694
SAM: With my Boots of Speed on, and the feat that
I took, I've got 80 feet of movement.

626
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:02,488
TRAVIS: Have you ever run in one of those balls on
the water? They don't go anywhere, man.

627
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:06,178
SAM: Shh. It's shooting water everywhere, it's
spraying it on Keyleth!

628
00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:16,355
MATT: You have 80 feet of movement on the sphere.
However, the sphere is half your movement to push

629
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:18,333
it, so you get to push it 40 feet.

630
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,908
SAM: But I'm also in water, and I don't know if it
has any friction or anything.

631
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:28,531
MATT: Right now, on the water, you get about that
far.

632
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:30,140
SAM: Hey, I moved!

633
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:39,722
MATT: (straining sound) It's splashing behind, the
ball's coasting, and you're almost three, two feet

634
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:44,047
from the edge of the rock, and you're like, "Oh
God! Oh God!" The sweat's starting to pour from

635
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,034
your brow.

636
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:47,086
TRAVIS: You're vomiting inside the sphere.

637
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:53,083
TALIESIN: Like the worst spin art ever.

638
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:57,571
MARISHA: Throwing up the wine you drank earlier.

639
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:59,442
MATT: All right. And what's Doty going to do?

640
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:07,280
SAM: I can't communicate with him, I don't think.
I don't think sound can escape, so he's going to

641
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,964
keep doing what I told him to do. Get to me, and
keep me away from other people.

642
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:18,108
MATT: Trapped inside the sphere, it doesn't say
anything about it making silence or blocking

643
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,385
sound, so you can still communicate.

644
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:25,528
TRAVIS: Does Sanctuary stay on Doty now, or does
it go away when I hit him?

645
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:27,987
MATT: Sanctuary, once you get an attack--

646
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,186
SAM: It lasts a minute.

647
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,715
MATT: It lasts a minute until--

648
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:33,834
SAM: It doesn't say if he gets hit it ends.

649
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:40,820
MATT: I'm pretty sure it's until the creature
attacks. Yes, until the warded creature takes an

650
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,938
attack. So right now, it still has Sanctuary on.

651
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:45,577
SAM: Okay, but if he attacks he'll lose it.

652
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:46,700
MATT: Yes.

653
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:56,054
SAM: I'm going to tell him to do that. Get to me
and get me away from other people. This is a

654
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:59,318
suicide mission for Doty, guys, this is not going
to end well for him.

655
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:01,338
TALIESIN: Doty's not going to win this.

656
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:05,196
MATT: That's a valid point and reminder. It
probably will be fine, but Keyleth, I should've

657
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:07,252
remembered, because he did have Sanctuary.

658
00:42:07,252 --> 00:42:10,863
SAM: No, it's okay, because hers was an area of
effect.

659
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:15,763
MATT: No, it wasn't. You target it to ram into
something. It wasn't a Fireball.

660
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:17,536
MARISHA: I have to make a wisdom saving throw?

661
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:22,867
MATT: Wisdom saving throw. Because it says "target
with a harmful spell." So, yes.

662
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:29,051
MARISHA: I've got crazy high wisdom. 22.

663
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:33,456
MATT: You're fine. I just wanted to double check
on that, because I totally forgot about the

664
00:42:33,456 --> 00:42:41,397
Sanctuary. But still warded with Sanctuary,
getting up, half movement, so Doty has 20 more

665
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:46,307
feet to move, I think. Speed of 40. What do you
want Doty to do?

666
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:48,468
SAM: Get to me and push me away.

667
00:42:48,468 --> 00:42:50,941
MATT: Okay, so Doty's going to move five--

668
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:52,953
MARISHA: Is he not affected by the gravity thing?

669
00:42:52,953 --> 00:43:06,575
MATT: No, he is, and he gets about that far.
Doty's like (clanging metal) "Tary!" A ball of

670
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:13,128
flames just slamming into the back. All right. I
think that ends your turn, Taryon. Percival,

671
00:43:13,128 --> 00:43:14,273
you're up.

672
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:17,547
TALIESIN: I'm going to dive into that room.

673
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:26,449
MATT: Okay. Five, ten, 15, 20. Your movement's
halved, it's like rough terrain, essentially, as

674
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:27,757
you're moving forward.

675
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,793
TALIESIN: So I've got two more movement? Two more
bits of movement?

676
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:32,959
MATT: Two more. But now as you get into the
doorway, it's not affecting you anymore. You do

677
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:34,341
see a small chest in the corner.

678
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:37,129
TALIESIN: I'm going to go over to the chest. I'm
going to try and fix my gun really quickly.

679
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:39,207
MATT: Okay, so make an action to try and repair it
real fast.

680
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:45,198
TALIESIN: That's fine. Had to roll a nine, I got a
12.

681
00:43:45,198 --> 00:43:46,653
MATT: Okay, yeah. So you repair Animus.

682
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:49,808
TALIESIN: And then I can't open the chest as
well.

683
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:51,193
MATT: It's an action to do that, yeah.

684
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:53,603
TALIESIN: All right. I'm just going to hide and
wait.

685
00:43:53,603 --> 00:43:58,914
MATT: Okay. So there you are. You are inside of
that chamber. Perfect.

686
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:03,600
SAM: Explosions.

687
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:14,166
MATT: All right. The large pillars that were
humming diminish. The slowly shifting blue,

688
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:22,588
crackling towers at the top of each large tower
begin to spin faster, and you hear (crackling) and

689
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:27,731
bursts of electrical energy just (static) out of
each side. Everyone on the tower, which would just

690
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,377
be you, I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw.

691
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,799
TALIESIN: Yeah!

692
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:34,190
LAURA: Are you celebrating that I'm getting hurt?

693
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,147
TALIESIN: Yes.

694
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:36,539
LAURA: You dick.

695
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,763
TALIESIN: I'm so excited that I don't have to be
the one to kill you. I don't want to be the one to

696
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:41,564
kill you. I'll never live that down.

697
00:44:41,564 --> 00:44:42,493
LAURA: 24.

698
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:45,768
MATT: Okay, so you succeed. It would be 16 points
of lightning damage, it's reduced to eight. So you

699
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:47,616
take eight points of lightning damage.

700
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:48,607
LAURA: All right.

701
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:53,330
MATT: And then as the bolt subsides, the towers
slowly spin back down and appear to have gone

702
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,789
dormant once more.

703
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:56,569
TALIESIN: This is a great map.

704
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:59,107
MATT: This has been fun so far. You guys just
barely got into it.

705
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:02,216
TRAVIS: Call of Duty needs to copy this map.

706
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:06,650
MATT: All right. Laura.

707
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,705
LAURA: Yeah?

708
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,675
MATT: Your turn.

709
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:09,722
LAURA: Okay.

710
00:45:09,722 --> 00:45:10,794
MATT: What you got, Vex?

711
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:12,322
LAURA: Okay. Who can I see?

712
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:19,328
MATT: You can see Doty. You can see Taryon. You
watched Keyleth turn into the fire elemental and

713
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:22,303
disappear into this chamber. And you watched Percy
run into this chamber.

714
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,148
TRAVIS: And the roofs of the chambers are stone,
wood?

715
00:45:24,148 --> 00:45:25,830
MATT: They're stone. Five feet of stone.

716
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,761
TALIESIN: We can't give suggestions, can we, over
the earpiece?

717
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:34,134
MATT: You can if you want to. You guys are welcome
to communicate between each other for this.

718
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:36,477
TRAVIS: On your turn!

719
00:45:36,477 --> 00:45:40,350
TALIESIN: Oh, shit. Damn it. Fuck, I had such a
good thing to do!

720
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:50,360
LAURA: Okay. Trinket's going to run up to Tary and
push him back in the water.

721
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,555
(laughing)

722
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:59,497
MATT: Trinket runs up (heavy footsteps) (growl)
and shoves you, and you spin back.

723
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:01,509
LAURA: Just gentle enough to put him right in the
middle.

724
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:07,078
MATT: Roll a strength check, because this is
pushing against Taryon's wound-up, Sonic the

725
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:08,666
Hedgehog, gotta-go-fast speed.

726
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,154
LAURA: 16.

727
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:13,181
MATT: 16. Okay, make a strength check.

728
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:16,191
SAM: Oh, no. Eight.

729
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:19,959
MATT: Yeah, you get pushed back right into the
center of the water there.

730
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:24,833
TALIESIN: This is the Overwatch map I've been
waiting for.

731
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:32,201
LAURA: Well, then, I'll tell you what. Was that an
attack for Trinket?

732
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:34,477
MATT: Yeah, that was Trinket's attack. It was a
shove attack.

733
00:46:34,477 --> 00:46:43,007
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to save my action
until somebody outside of

734
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:46,429
Tary or Doty becomes visible.

735
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,954
MATT: Okay, so you're holding your attack action,
arrow ready, waiting for someone else to show up.

736
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:52,704
That ends your turn, Vex. Grog, you're up.

737
00:46:52,704 --> 00:47:02,780
TRAVIS: I'll remedy that shit. Can I rage-tiptoe
up to the doorway at the bottom?

738
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,342
MATT: Okay, you (ferocious growling) (quieter
growling).

739
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:07,332
LAURA: The minute I see his head!

740
00:47:07,332 --> 00:47:11,411
MATT: You glance through and you see a large,
burning ball of fire that's right there, just

741
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:18,634
chilling. You see Doty (heavy footsteps) running
away towards the water, where you see Taryon being

742
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:21,688
pushed back in the water by a large bear.

743
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:24,331
TRAVIS: And the fireball's around here?

744
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:30,068
MATT: And as soon as you glance up... a dual arrow
release.

745
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:31,210
LAURA: 17.

746
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,380
TRAVIS: That's my AC.

747
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,121
MATT: Yep. So you get two strikes on this.

748
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:39,023
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm literally doing this, so does
she get me in the fucking eyeball?

749
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,077
MATT: Yep.

750
00:47:40,077 --> 00:47:41,280
TRAVIS: Oh, God.

751
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,812
LAURA: 11 halved. Plus three lightning damage.

752
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:49,063
MATT: So eight damage. Or, because lightning's
halved, too, right?

753
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:50,743
LAURA: Oh, because you're enlarged.

754
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:51,861
MATT: So six damage.

755
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:53,022
LAURA: All right.

756
00:47:53,022 --> 00:47:54,517
TALIESIN: Whittle him down.

757
00:47:54,517 --> 00:48:05,176
LAURA: Ooh, that next one is good. That definitely
hits. And then 16, 17, 19 halved.

758
00:48:05,176 --> 00:48:07,311
TRAVIS: Nine?

759
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:08,987
LAURA: Because he's not by anybody, is he?

760
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,350
MATT: Currently, no.

761
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,424
LAURA: Okay.

762
00:48:11,424 --> 00:48:17,161
MATT: By the way, it is a tiny doorway, and you
are a big man. The hatch you went through was a

763
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:23,985
leap down, and you barely fit through. This
doorway is going to cost you some movement to get

764
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:24,916
through it.

765
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:28,669
TRAVIS: Oh, balls and ass. Okay, can I, after
getting shot in the face--

766
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:32,003
MATT: Yeah, it's like (whooshing arrow) (scream).

767
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:35,371
TALIESIN: You're not having a good day. You're
like an Ernest film right now.

768
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,508
Ernest goes to war.

769
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:41,755
TRAVIS: Ernest goes to camp. Can I break out
through the door and run down here to this corner

770
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,942
as far as I can? How far do you think I can get
with my movement?

771
00:48:43,942 --> 00:48:47,445
MATT: You get out there, it'll take you ten
movement. To get to the doorway, it took you ten

772
00:48:47,445 --> 00:48:50,314
movement, to move and get out of it, so you have
30 more feet from here.

773
00:48:50,314 --> 00:48:52,870
TRAVIS: Okay. How far will that take me on those
squares?

774
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:53,910
MATT: Going this way?

775
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,257
TRAVIS: To that corner.

776
00:48:55,257 --> 00:48:59,042
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. You can get
there.

777
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:01,628
TRAVIS: Yeah, actually, can I come towards you
instead of going back that way,

778
00:49:01,628 --> 00:49:04,393
and can I lay down prone?

779
00:49:04,393 --> 00:49:07,619
MATT: Sure.

780
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:13,792
LAURA: Down and dirty.

781
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:18,220
MATT: All righty. Grog is lying down prone. Is
that your turn?

782
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:24,662
TRAVIS: Can I use my Second Wind to roll a 1d10?

783
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:25,937
MATT: Yes, you can.

784
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:30,434
TRAVIS: Okay. Plus my fighter level. Fucking A.
Ten plus two. 12.

785
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:35,509
MATT: There you go. You gain 12 hit points. All
right. So, Grog, that's your turn?

786
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:36,633
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

787
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:41,871
MATT: Keyleth. You didn't use your action, so if
you wanted to, you could use your action to move

788
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:44,569
again if you wanted to dash. Don't forget you have
that option.

789
00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:47,049
TRAVIS: Oh! Is that 50 more feet? Oh, really?

790
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:51,236
MATT: Yeah. If you're not using your action for
anything else, and your Second Wind is a bonus

791
00:49:51,236 --> 00:49:52,585
action, if I recall, correct?

792
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:53,414
TRAVIS: Yeah.

793
00:49:53,414 --> 00:49:54,332
MATT: So yeah.

794
00:49:54,332 --> 00:50:01,014
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's just mad-dash tear ass towards
the tower that shot me in the eyeball. I might not

795
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:02,494
even get all the way, but we're going to see.

796
00:50:02,494 --> 00:50:05,372
MATT: All right, so instead of falling prone, you
go.

797
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:10,766
TRAVIS: Yeah, just turn the corner and book it
like the T-1000 in Terminator 2, just chopping.

798
00:50:10,766 --> 00:50:15,559
MATT: Do you want to go this way or this way to
get towards the tower?

799
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,822
Like, the perimeter or center?

800
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:18,967
TRAVIS: Perimeter. Perimeter.

801
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:22,065
MATT: Okay. You get there, and then you go prone?

802
00:50:22,065 --> 00:50:23,142
TRAVIS: Yeah!

803
00:50:23,142 --> 00:50:24,917
MATT: All righty. Say you're prone there.

804
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,911
LAURA: Can totally see your head outside of the--

805
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:27,862
TRAVIS: No you can't.

806
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:29,912
LAURA: Yeah, I can. From where I am, I can see
your head.

807
00:50:29,912 --> 00:50:35,252
MATT: From where you are, you cannot see him. You
watched him run; he wasn't being stealthy about it

808
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:37,175
and he's 12 feet tall right now.

809
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:38,775
TRAVIS: Team Target Practice!

810
00:50:38,775 --> 00:50:43,428
MATT: You're watching him (heavy footsteps) and
he's just out of view, but you know exactly where

811
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:52,077
he is. Ends Grog's turn. Keyleth, you're up. You
see a giant Grog just (heavy footsteps) loom past

812
00:50:52,077 --> 00:50:57,319
the outside of the structure. You see this
flickering fire of Keyleth's elemental form in the

813
00:50:57,319 --> 00:50:59,162
inside of this structure there.

814
00:50:59,162 --> 00:51:08,667
MARISHA: I look to see if he's going to keep
going. Okay, know where Grog is. Is there any

815
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:11,923
windows in this little shack that we're in or--

816
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:14,961
MATT: No, there's just the doorway here and the
doorway here. Those are the only--

817
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:17,314
MARISHA: No bars or cracks or crevices?

818
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:21,771
MATT: Not from what you can tell. You can
investigate for it if you want to, but that'll be

819
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:22,769
your action.

820
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:28,355
MARISHA: No, fuck that. Okay, I'm going to move
out-- sorry.

821
00:51:28,402 --> 00:51:34,112
I'm going to go up to Trinket over here.

822
00:51:34,112 --> 00:51:37,687
LAURA: Aww. You terrible person.

823
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:39,496
MARISHA: Can I get into Trinket's space?

824
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,956
MATT: Yeah, it's 25 feet to get into Trinket's
space.

825
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:45,152
MARISHA: Well, let me do my attack first.

826
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:49,690
MATT: Okay, go for it. So 20 movement right next
to Trinket.

827
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:55,385
MARISHA: I'm going to be like, good job with the
ball, buddy! Shh, go to sleep! Go to sleep, we'll

828
00:51:55,385 --> 00:52:00,113
make it less painful for you! We'll make this very
painless. Go to sleep. I'm sorry, I just can't

829
00:52:00,113 --> 00:52:05,105
have you messing stuff up right now! That's true.
I'm trying to smoke him out first.

830
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:09,125
TALIESIN: Your nervous system knows to keep you
awake and conscious for that whole event.

831
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:14,064
SAM: Only you can prevent--

832
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,022
MARISHA: 15 for the first one.

833
00:52:16,022 --> 00:52:17,384
MATT: I believe that misses on Trinket.

834
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,823
MARISHA: Natural 20 for the second.

835
00:52:18,823 --> 00:52:22,351
MATT: Okay! So, the first one misses, the second
one definitely hits. Go ahead and roll double-die

836
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:24,206
damage on the second one.

837
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:28,450
TALIESIN: It's un-bear-able.

838
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:38,016
MARISHA: I get to reroll ones. I also get an extra
d6 for my fire hands.

839
00:52:38,016 --> 00:52:42,935
And then I double die roll, right?

840
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:44,650
MATT: Yes, and then add the bonus.

841
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:51,778
MARISHA: 14, 15, so 30, plus 33 fire damage.

842
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:55,164
MATT: So Trinket takes 33 fire damage and is
currently on fire.

843
00:52:55,164 --> 00:52:56,657
LAURA: Aww, buddy.

844
00:52:56,657 --> 00:53:00,982
MATT: So, Trinket is like (very unhappy bear
groans) (roars).

845
00:53:00,982 --> 00:53:02,501
SAM: There's water right there!

846
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:09,451
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action
to turn over and take my flaming sphere and go

847
00:53:09,451 --> 00:53:11,984
(whoosh) and ram Tary again.

848
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:13,405
MATT: Tary or Doty?

849
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:14,928
MARISHA: Doty, sorry.

850
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:17,985
MATT: Go ahead and make another wisdom saving
throw.

851
00:53:17,985 --> 00:53:20,312
LAURA: Wait, how many damage was that?

852
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:22,572
TALIESIN: 35?

853
00:53:22,572 --> 00:53:24,788
LAURA: 34? I'm going to say 34.

854
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:26,881
MARISHA: 19.

855
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:30,543
MATT: 19? Yeah. Go ahead and roll a dexterity
saving throw for Doty,

856
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:32,641
and roll another 5d6 fire damage.

857
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:36,359
SAM: Pretty good, this is plus his dex, which is
nothing. 18.

858
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,543
MATT: What's your spell DC?

859
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:40,233
MARISHA: 20.

860
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:43,381
MATT: Yeah, no. So, full 5d6 fire damage.

861
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:53,501
MARISHA: Those don't count, it's fine. That's not
great. I can reroll that one. Two, four, six,

862
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:57,827
eight, 11 points of fire damage.

863
00:53:57,827 --> 00:53:59,557
SAM: We have our first victim.

864
00:53:59,557 --> 00:54:01,238
LAURA: Oh, Doty!

865
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:06,227
MATT: As the ball slams into the back, you watch
as Doty's open chamber where the book is held goes

866
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:09,747
(cling) and flings open as fire bursts out from
the inside.

867
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:10,973
TRAVIS: Protect the book!

868
00:54:10,973 --> 00:54:11,806
SAM: No!

869
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:16,361
MATT: He's now burnt and hollowed out from the
inside, and you watch as a cinder cluster of pages

870
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:24,446
hits the ground before burning away. Doty goes,
"Tar--" (clang) and falls to the ground.

871
00:54:24,446 --> 00:54:25,866
MARISHA: Sorry! Sorry, guys!

872
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:28,793
SAM: Does the fire ignite his cannon hand?

873
00:54:28,793 --> 00:54:31,963
TRAVIS: Look, he's rolling for it!

874
00:54:31,963 --> 00:54:40,723
MATT: One arm detonates. It doesn't hit anybody,
but there's now curled pieces of broken and

875
00:54:40,723 --> 00:54:43,697
sheared metal where the arm once was.

876
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:49,375
MARISHA: I'm going to take my other 25 feet of
movement that I have left to go back into the--

877
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,913
MATT: What's the speed of your fire elemental?

878
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:51,669
MARISHA: 50.

879
00:54:51,669 --> 00:54:57,450
MATT: Yeah, so you have 25-- no, it was-- you have
30 more feet of movement.

880
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,530
MARISHA: I go back inside for cover.

881
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:08,495
SAM: It's like she was never there. This crazy
fireball came out, lit a bear on fire and went

882
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:09,578
back in the room!

883
00:55:09,578 --> 00:55:12,280
TRAVIS: Do we have a certain amount of health
potions or anything like that? Like a set number

884
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,183
of them?

885
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:14,395
MATT: What's that, I'm sorry?

886
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:16,550
TRAVIS: Did we start with like a set number of
health potions or anything?

887
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,588
Like one each, or two each.

888
00:55:17,588 --> 00:55:19,399
LAURA: Or is it just what we had on our body?

889
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:23,011
MATT: We'll say for the sake of fairness, because
I realize now if one of you guys was the keeper of

890
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:25,068
the health potions you'd be way too unfair.

891
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:26,445
TRAVIS: Right. I have a shitload.

892
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:28,963
LAURA: Yeah, we aren't, but yeah that's true, Grog
always has a bunch.

893
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:30,953
MATT: I'd say none of you have health potions on
you right now.

894
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:31,911
TRAVIS: Okay.

895
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,982
MATT: You may have to search the battlefield to
discover things to help you.

896
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:39,747
TRAVIS: I'm way too ragey to search for shit.

897
00:55:39,747 --> 00:55:41,736
MARISHA: I'm sorry for beating up Trinket.

898
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:43,312
MATT: All right. Keyleth, that's the end of your
turn?

899
00:55:43,312 --> 00:55:44,243
MARISHA: Yeah.

900
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:45,464
MATT: Okay. Taryon.

901
00:55:45,464 --> 00:55:47,451
MARISHA: Vex is mad at me.

902
00:55:47,451 --> 00:55:57,153
SAM: As my action I tear off my patch of Healing
Potions. Now I have four healing potions.

903
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:01,205
(laughter)

904
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:02,387
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

905
00:56:02,387 --> 00:56:04,829
TALIESIN: He's a lootdrop. We just have to-- Like
he's like such a lootdrop.

906
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,057
TRAVIS: Wait, wait. Ten rounds it lasts, right?

907
00:56:07,057 --> 00:56:10,629
TALIESIN: Not anymore, it's now eight. It's nine
rounds or eight rounds.

908
00:56:10,629 --> 00:56:16,684
LAURA: Don't, none of us do anything. If we don't
do anything for a minute, Tary's weak.

909
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:20,502
MARISHA: That would be so fucked up.

910
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,160
SAM: Don't believe them, Grog, they'll turn on
you.

911
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,123
TRAVIS: Why is there a tapping on this end of the
earpiece?

912
00:56:27,123 --> 00:56:31,284
TALIESIN: This is such a Community episode: in
eight rounds he dies of exposure. I wait nine

913
00:56:31,284 --> 00:56:33,841
rounds. (laughs)

914
00:56:33,841 --> 00:56:37,911
MARISHA: (laughs) That's so true. It's so true.

915
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:42,729
MATT: So Tary, you have your four healing potions.

916
00:56:42,729 --> 00:56:44,241
SAM: Can I take one of them?

917
00:56:44,241 --> 00:56:45,866
MATT: As a bonus action you can, yeah.

918
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:56,128
SAM: I will take one. Yeah! Oh, that's cocked. Ooh!
Ten points, I am whole again.

919
00:56:56,128 --> 00:56:57,251
MATT: There you go.

920
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,502
SAM: Great.

921
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:00,486
MATT: And you're going to attempt to move?

922
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:06,975
SAM: Oh yeah! I mean sure, when Trinket pushed me
do I have momentum that way?

923
00:57:06,975 --> 00:57:08,414
MATT: The momentum is now going this way.

924
00:57:08,414 --> 00:57:10,405
SAM: Okay, so I'll turn around and I'll go that
way.

925
00:57:10,405 --> 00:57:15,191
MATT: You turn around, okay. I'll say you get just
to the edge and you can get ten more feet, that

926
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,169
direction. As the rest of it carries you onto the
land on the other side.

927
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:21,055
That's as far as you get. Okay.

928
00:57:21,055 --> 00:57:22,052
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

929
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,853
MATT: That ends your turn. Percival.

930
00:57:23,853 --> 00:57:27,692
TALIESIN: I'm going to check that chest.

931
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:28,999
MATT: Okay.

932
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:30,418
TALIESIN: Is that a full action?

933
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:31,370
MATT: It is, yes.

934
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,451
TALIESIN: All right.

935
00:57:32,451 --> 00:57:36,136
MATT: So you go (chest opening) throw the chest
open.

936
00:57:36,136 --> 00:57:37,336
LAURA: It's a mimic!

937
00:57:37,336 --> 00:57:40,170
MATT: Ha, shit. No, you do find a greater healing
potion.

938
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:47,818
TALIESIN: I take the greater healing potion. And
then I've got some movement, right, okay. And then

939
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:54,024
I go one, two, three, four-- Can I get to behind
that building? Behind the building towards you?

940
00:57:54,024 --> 00:57:54,842
MATT: Over here?

941
00:57:54,842 --> 00:58:00,363
TALIESIN: No, no like directly-- Yeah, like as far
over there as possible. I'll come out the door I

942
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:05,591
came in. Yeah, over there. And if I have anything
left I'll start walking up the wall. I know I

943
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:06,473
won't make it.

944
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:09,165
MATT: Okay, you can get to the very top if you
want to.

945
00:58:09,165 --> 00:58:11,570
TALIESIN: Not quite, next round I'm going to pop
up.

946
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:15,188
MATT: Okay, so we'll say you're right there. But
this chest is opened, so I'll turn it to the side

947
00:58:15,188 --> 00:58:16,629
as a reminder.

948
00:58:16,629 --> 00:58:18,215
TALIESIN: Knock it prone.

949
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:26,877
MATT: Basically. You knocked the chest prone.
Okay! That's the end of your turn, Percival?

950
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:28,074
TALIESIN: Yep.

951
00:58:28,074 --> 00:58:41,775
MATT: All righty. The fiery braziers around
suddenly begin to (explosion) and detonate, as the

952
00:58:41,775 --> 00:58:49,082
flames inside burst out in a radius. Nobody is
quite in the radius to be affected by them. You

953
00:58:49,082 --> 00:58:52,861
watch as the corners of the battlefield are
suddenly engulfed in flames briefly. Then the

954
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:57,953
flames retract back into just very gently burning
braziers.

955
00:58:57,953 --> 00:59:01,218
TALIESIN: I love it. This is like Battlebots.

956
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,588
MATT: Vex, you're up.

957
00:59:03,588 --> 00:59:08,153
LAURA: Okay, Grog's coming for me.

958
00:59:08,153 --> 00:59:09,384
TRAVIS: No.

959
00:59:09,384 --> 00:59:14,369
LAURA: First of all, Trinket's going to just wade
out into that water to get no longer on fire.

960
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:18,804
MATT: Okay, well, Trinket first takes three points
of fire damage at the top of the round. Trinket

961
00:59:18,804 --> 00:59:24,299
wades into the water and does manage to put out
the fire. However, Trinket does take--

962
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,416
LAURA: Damn it, it's acid or something. What is
it?

963
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:28,026
MATT: -- does take six points of acid damage.

964
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:30,557
TRAVIS: Ooh, that shit's not water, it's acid!

965
00:59:30,557 --> 00:59:31,757
MATT: Nope, it is not water.

966
00:59:31,757 --> 00:59:33,302
TRAVIS: He called that shit poop.

967
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:36,664
MATT: As Trinket wades in he goes (acid sounds)
(hurt bear sounds).

968
00:59:36,664 --> 00:59:39,131
LAURA: No, Trinket goes ow, ow, and then he comes
back out.

969
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:42,283
MATT: He gets back out of the water, and he's
like-- you see like the (sizzling) off of him.

970
00:59:42,283 --> 00:59:46,033
LAURA: Trinket, I didn't even tell you to do that,
you just did that on your own! And then--

971
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:47,568
MATT: If a bear could shrug--

972
00:59:47,568 --> 00:59:53,559
LAURA: Yeah, you know. And then I'm going to get
on my broom--

973
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:55,254
MATT: What is a whale?

974
00:59:55,254 --> 01:00:07,816
LAURA: What's a whale? I get on my broom and I
want to fly up and over, above Grog.

975
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:13,605
MATT: Okay, so you (whoosh) over, and as you get
up, you almost bump into the ceiling

976
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:15,036
where that tower is.

977
01:00:15,036 --> 01:00:19,319
LAURA: Actually, could I actually get to Grog if I
was flying?

978
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:24,863
MATT: If you were flying from here? You could get
right over there and see him on the ground, yeah.

979
01:00:24,863 --> 01:00:27,086
LAURA: I couldn't get down to him, though?

980
01:00:27,086 --> 01:00:29,055
MATT: You could get right down to him.

981
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:39,248
LAURA: Oh, this is going to be the worst move ever
if it doesn't work. I'm going to get down to where

982
01:00:39,248 --> 01:00:45,154
Grog is. This is so stupid, though! No, because if
it doesn't work I can't get away! Because that's

983
01:00:45,154 --> 01:00:46,449
all my movement, isn't it?

984
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:48,151
TRAVIS: Let's team up, you and me.

985
01:00:48,151 --> 01:00:49,608
MATT: What are you doing?

986
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:58,644
LAURA: You want to team up? I go down to Grog and
I say, let's shake on it.

987
01:00:58,727 --> 01:01:02,780
But I take my necklace
off and I put it into my hand.

988
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:07,364
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Oh!

989
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:09,351
MATT: Make a deception check.

990
01:01:09,351 --> 01:01:11,387
TRAVIS: Which is not hard.

991
01:01:11,387 --> 01:01:19,497
LAURA: Oh, it's a one. Whatever. I still try to
touch it to him. Whatever, he doesn't do it.

992
01:01:19,497 --> 01:01:21,574
MATT: Right. So Grog, do you accept it?

993
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:24,502
TRAVIS: No.

994
01:01:24,502 --> 01:01:27,679
MATT: Okay. She still touches it to you, but
you're not willing,

995
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,078
so what's the saving throw on that?

996
01:01:30,078 --> 01:01:32,571
LAURA: It's a wisdom saving throw.

997
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:34,430
TRAVIS: You sneaky.

998
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,251
LAURA: It's only a ten.

999
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:45,105
TRAVIS: That's okay, it's not a high modifier.
That's a five.

1000
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:55,868
MATT: (suction sound) Grog, you are absorbed into
a familiar dark stony throne room, staring out

1001
01:01:55,868 --> 01:02:02,031
through this small open space, almost like a
personalized movie theater of

1002
01:02:02,031 --> 01:02:03,735
the outside of the necklace.

1003
01:02:03,735 --> 01:02:05,192
TRAVIS: How do I get out?

1004
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:07,551
LAURA: You can't unless I release you.

1005
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:16,669
MATT: She has to release you. Mind you, Vex, the
battle cannot be won until all the other people

1006
01:02:16,669 --> 01:02:18,610
have been defeated. This is not considered
defeat.

1007
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,071
TALIESIN: You could release him into the acid,
though.

1008
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:22,004
LAURA: Hey, man. My mind's already there.

1009
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:30,048
MATT: Remember, just be aware, if you're the last
one standing after everything else happens and you

1010
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:33,334
release Grog, he's going to destroy you, so think
tactically.

1011
01:02:33,384 --> 01:02:42,423
LAURA: Yes, I plan on it, believe me. I'm going to
use my bonus action to stay hidden from... for my

1012
01:02:42,423 --> 01:02:46,576
skirmisher stealth, can I pick a target? I want to
stay hidden from Keyleth.

1013
01:02:46,576 --> 01:02:49,961
MATT: Okay. You cannot, because in order to get
there, your full movement leaves you right in the

1014
01:02:49,961 --> 01:02:54,102
doorway where she can see you. You literally
landed, did that to Grog, and turned over your

1015
01:02:54,102 --> 01:02:56,762
shoulder and see a giant fire elemental looking
right at you.

1016
01:02:56,762 --> 01:02:59,379
LAURA: Great. So I can't use my bonus action to
hide, because she's right there.

1017
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:01,089
MATT: Yep, because you're not behind anything.

1018
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:06,872
LAURA: Tight. I'm going to then use my skirmisher
to stay hidden from Percy,

1019
01:03:06,872 --> 01:03:12,698
and I've got nothing I can do.

1020
01:03:12,698 --> 01:03:16,925
TRAVIS: Fuck. Fuck! Like a rat in a cage.

1021
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:20,553
MATT: You're just (groans).

1022
01:03:20,553 --> 01:03:24,121
TALIESIN: I imagine this as the interior of the
genie bottle from I Dream of Jeannie.

1023
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:26,587
Pink and plush.

1024
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:30,753
TRAVIS: Really? I was picturing something from
Saw, like the inside is just awful.

1025
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:36,126
MATT: The inside is essentially a 20-by-20-foot
cold stone room with a central stone throne, and

1026
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:40,061
the view you have is this ten-foot-by-five-foot
slit window that looks out from the necklace.

1027
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:41,338
TRAVIS: Is it fish-eyed?

1028
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:47,935
MATT: No, it's just a perspective. This is what
Galdrick, the wolf, had been looking through for

1029
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:56,168
hundreds of years. And what Trinket looks through
whenever he's trapped. That's your turn, Vex.

1030
01:03:56,216 --> 01:03:58,885
Keyleth, you're up. What are you doing?

1031
01:03:58,885 --> 01:04:00,392
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1032
01:04:00,392 --> 01:04:02,912
SAM: It's like prison. You could do some
push-ups.

1033
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:09,172
TRAVIS: I'm going to Rocky montage this shit.
Wait, are you skipping me?

1034
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:14,028
MATT: Oh, that's right, you're up next. Grog, what
do you want to do?

1035
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:21,056
TRAVIS: I'm going to flip the fuck out! I'm inside
of a goddamn box! I'm going to take my Dwarven

1036
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:25,835
Thrower and throw it as hard as I can at the
window!

1037
01:04:25,835 --> 01:04:28,432
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack.

1038
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:37,108
TRAVIS: Yep. Reckless! Yep. Almost a natural 20.
26.

1039
01:04:37,108 --> 01:04:39,017
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

1040
01:04:39,017 --> 01:04:47,980
TRAVIS: Awesome. I'm getting out of here in no
time. 25.

1041
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,540
MATT: All right. Damage?

1042
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,984
TRAVIS: Yeah, 25 damage.

1043
01:04:51,984 --> 01:04:55,478
MATT: Okay. Good. You are also technically sieged
because of your gauntlets.

1044
01:04:55,478 --> 01:04:56,932
TRAVIS: That's right, double damage.

1045
01:04:56,932 --> 01:05:06,212
MATT: All right. As you slam your axe into the
front of this, you watch as the stone (rumble)

1046
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:10,517
quakes a little bit, and a little bit of dust
(hiss) settles from the ceiling.

1047
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:12,709
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1048
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:13,968
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

1049
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:16,417
LAURA: He could bust out of the necklace.

1050
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:20,564
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is also Matt Mercer, who had us
fight an entire thing, taking down damage the

1051
01:05:20,564 --> 01:05:27,097
whole time while nothing was happening. I'll take
all three attacks at the window. Reckless.

1052
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:28,899
MATT: Go ahead and roll attack.

1053
01:05:28,899 --> 01:05:31,881
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1054
01:05:31,881 --> 01:05:36,808
LAURA: Does that mean if I put an actual monster
inside of it during the game

1055
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,632
that they could break out?

1056
01:05:38,632 --> 01:05:39,913
SAM: You don't know.

1057
01:05:39,913 --> 01:05:45,999
TALIESIN: They'd have to think of it. I wouldn't
think of attacking the room, and he's designed to

1058
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:47,131
hurt rooms.

1059
01:05:47,131 --> 01:05:48,795
LAURA: And he's designed to not think.

1060
01:05:48,795 --> 01:05:50,394
MATT: He's designed to make terrible choices.

1061
01:05:50,394 --> 01:05:55,877
TALIESIN: The room could collapse and squish him
like a bug, for all we know.

1062
01:05:55,877 --> 01:05:59,737
TRAVIS: That critical is 55.

1063
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:03,388
MATT: So that's 110 points of damage with your
siege weaponry.

1064
01:06:03,388 --> 01:06:08,006
LAURA: I'm so dead, you guys. He's going to pop
out!

1065
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:13,898
MATT: As you rear back for your second strike, you
bring your axe to go against this crystalline

1066
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:20,758
field, this layer that defends you from that. As
you slam it, the axe hits and you watch as it

1067
01:06:20,758 --> 01:06:26,964
spider-cracks (cracking) all across, and the room
(rumbling) is now actively shaking. As you look

1068
01:06:26,964 --> 01:06:30,455
around, you can see that the walls are starting to
crumble, and rocks begin to tumble, and you see

1069
01:06:30,455 --> 01:06:33,124
what looks like a black void behind the cracks
that are opening.

1070
01:06:33,124 --> 01:06:35,316
LAURA: Oh no, that could be really bad.

1071
01:06:35,316 --> 01:06:39,399
MATT: You have a third attack, Grog. What are you
going to do, Mr. Raging?

1072
01:06:39,399 --> 01:06:47,063
TALIESIN: Oh god, I love watching his brain
strain.

1073
01:06:47,063 --> 01:06:49,576
MATT: What are you going to do?

1074
01:06:49,576 --> 01:06:50,493
TRAVIS: Fuck it!

1075
01:06:50,493 --> 01:06:52,209
LAURA: Oh shit!

1076
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,203
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1077
01:06:54,203 --> 01:06:55,853
MARISHA: No way. You are lying!

1078
01:06:55,853 --> 01:06:57,022
TRAVIS: No, it's true.

1079
01:06:57,022 --> 01:07:01,476
LAURA: What if you get sucked into a random void?
Then we can never defeat you.

1080
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,417
MATT: Roll some damage.

1081
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:07,893
MARISHA: If he gets sucked into a random void, I
imagine that would be considered defeat?

1082
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:10,589
MATT: Oh, he would be fucking dead.

1083
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,455
TRAVIS: 60 this time, so 120.

1084
01:07:12,455 --> 01:07:21,099
MATT: So 120 points of damage. So Grog. You rear
back once more, and that little bit of doubt in

1085
01:07:21,099 --> 01:07:25,737
the back of your brain, you quickly squash! As
your frenzied fury takes over, you see nothing but

1086
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:30,564
red, anger, and blood, as you rear back a third
time and (whack). As you slam it, you hear what

1087
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:36,047
sounds like a thousand windows shattering at once,
and all the walls suddenly collapse in towards

1088
01:07:36,047 --> 01:07:41,061
you, rocketing and spiraling inward. It crushes
into your body as you're thrust forward as the

1089
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:44,647
crystalline structure ahead of you shatters and
pulls you through like a heavy vacuum.

1090
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:46,878
LAURA: Oh god, he's out!

1091
01:07:46,946 --> 01:07:48,288
SAM: Or he's dead.

1092
01:07:48,288 --> 01:07:55,430
MATT: You suffer 26 points of piercing and
bludgeoning damage.

1093
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:56,888
TRAVIS: Halved to 13?

1094
01:07:56,888 --> 01:07:58,052
MATT: Halved to 13.

1095
01:07:58,052 --> 01:07:59,216
SAM: That's not bad.

1096
01:07:59,216 --> 01:08:01,214
TRAVIS: And imploded from the inside?

1097
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:05,468
MATT: And the necklace in front of you
(shattering) shatters off your chest, and you

1098
01:08:05,468 --> 01:08:11,308
watch as a giant Grog, right there into the
hallway, right in front of you.

1099
01:08:11,308 --> 01:08:15,605
MARISHA: Oh shit! So much just happened!

1100
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:19,872
TRAVIS: Because I reference Terminator 2 later...

1101
01:08:19,872 --> 01:08:27,374
TALIESIN: You punched a hole through time and
space. Well done.

1102
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:35,072
MATT: Your necklace is gone. It is not functional
for the rest of this battle. I was not expecting

1103
01:08:35,072 --> 01:08:37,420
you to attack the inside of the wall.

1104
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,876
TRAVIS: I was just going to do it because he's an
idiot, but that really worked!

1105
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:43,670
MATT: All righty! That ends your turn, Grog.

1106
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:44,514
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1107
01:08:44,514 --> 01:08:45,569
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

1108
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:46,924
LAURA: I was going to release you!

1109
01:08:46,924 --> 01:08:48,358
SAM: In acid!

1110
01:08:48,358 --> 01:09:00,298
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to turn around and be
like (screams, booming) on both of these guys. I'm

1111
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:12,659
going to move into Vex's space and then attack
Grog. (bam, bam)

1112
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:15,774
MATT: Go for it. You're technically occupying
Vex's space, right there.

1113
01:09:15,774 --> 01:09:16,890
MARISHA: Correct.

1114
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,793
MATT: So you attack.

1115
01:09:18,793 --> 01:09:21,718
MARISHA: 15.

1116
01:09:21,718 --> 01:09:23,013
TRAVIS: Misses.

1117
01:09:23,013 --> 01:09:30,457
MARISHA: Second one, much better. That hits. 16
plus six is 22.

1118
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:35,934
MATT: 22? That hits, yeah. So go ahead and roll
damage against Vex. Vex, you also catch fire.

1119
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:39,266
MARISHA: Oh, I'm attacking Grog.

1120
01:09:39,266 --> 01:09:43,790
MATT: Oh, Grog! I misunderstood, sorry. So Grog,
you catch fire. Flames are just (whoosh).

1121
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:47,994
SAM: You're having a weird six seconds of your
life right now.

1122
01:09:47,994 --> 01:09:57,732
TRAVIS: I know! (panting, warp sound effect,
screaming) Hulk angry!

1123
01:09:57,732 --> 01:10:00,546
MARISHA: That's 20 fire damage.

1124
01:10:00,546 --> 01:10:04,385
MATT: So you take 20 points of fire damage,
reduced to ten, and you're on fire. And you will

1125
01:10:04,385 --> 01:10:08,292
remain on fire, taking 1d10 fire damage every
round, until you spend an action to put it out.

1126
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:09,579
SAM: But it looks cool.

1127
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:14,580
MATT: But it looks cool. All right, and because
you moved into Vex's space, Vex, you also catch

1128
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:21,291
fire automatically. Does she immediately take the
1d10 damage for occupying someone's space?

1129
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:29,773
MARISHA: The first time it enters a creature's
space on a turn, that creature takes 1d10 fire

1130
01:10:29,773 --> 01:10:31,290
damage and catches fire.

1131
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:37,811
MATT: Okay. So roll 1d10 damage for Vex.
Technically, both of them, because you had to move

1132
01:10:37,811 --> 01:10:40,906
into both of their spaces to do it, so you take
another 1d10 damage, Grog.

1133
01:10:40,906 --> 01:10:45,034
MARISHA: Five for Vex and four for Grog.

1134
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:47,820
MATT: All right, so Grog, you take two points of
fire damage. Vex, you take five.

1135
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,743
TRAVIS: Can I make my retaliation strike after her
melee on me?

1136
01:10:51,743 --> 01:10:52,872
MATT: Yes, you can.

1137
01:10:52,872 --> 01:10:59,047
TRAVIS: Okay. Reckless! Where's the crit now?
That's what I want to know.

1138
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:03,091
MATT: Actually, that's a valid point. Go ahead and
roll, because he did reckless attack last turn.

1139
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:04,742
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you do get advantage.

1140
01:11:04,742 --> 01:11:09,107
MARISHA: Oh, on that first one again? Nope.

1141
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:11,577
MATT: Okay. So what's your attack roll?

1142
01:11:11,577 --> 01:11:14,715
TRAVIS: It is a 22.

1143
01:11:14,715 --> 01:11:16,835
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1144
01:11:16,835 --> 01:11:21,471
MARISHA: This is going to hurt.

1145
01:11:21,471 --> 01:11:33,962
TRAVIS: Nah, you're fine. No, that's going to
hurt. I'm just kidding. Yeah, 25. That's it.

1146
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:36,286
MATT: 25 points of damage to your fire elemental
form.

1147
01:11:36,286 --> 01:11:40,893
MARISHA: Okay. Is that halved because it's
bludgeoning? No, his weapon's magical.

1148
01:11:40,893 --> 01:11:43,957
MATT: You take full damage. However, doesn't he
take damage whenever he...

1149
01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:49,229
MARISHA: Yeah, when he attacks me, he takes
another 1d10 damage.

1150
01:11:49,229 --> 01:11:50,520
TRAVIS: Good to know.

1151
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,803
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm an asshole. Eight.

1152
01:11:53,803 --> 01:11:59,826
MATT: So you take four points of fire damage. All
righty. Keyleth, so that's your action. You've

1153
01:11:59,826 --> 01:12:04,509
moved 15 feet to get into Vex's and Grog's space.

1154
01:12:04,509 --> 01:12:16,509
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to back out and around
again, through the room.

1155
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:21,333
MATT: Okay, so that's 15, 20, 25, 30. You're going
to stay in the room?

1156
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:22,673
MARISHA: Do I have any more?

1157
01:12:22,673 --> 01:12:25,034
MATT: Yes, you have 20 more feet of movement from
here.

1158
01:12:25,034 --> 01:12:29,737
MARISHA: Yeah, let me go out one more and onto
this lip next to Trinket.

1159
01:12:29,737 --> 01:12:30,924
MATT: There?

1160
01:12:30,924 --> 01:12:37,026
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my bonus action to
take my Flaming Sphere, and I want to jump it over

1161
01:12:37,026 --> 01:12:43,926
this shallow end on this far side. I've got
cameras right in front of me. It can jump over a

1162
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,533
ten-foot gap.

1163
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:48,378
MATT: How much does it move?

1164
01:12:48,378 --> 01:12:52,624
MARISHA: 30. Can it get ten more feet over?

1165
01:12:52,624 --> 01:12:57,396
MATT: 25, 30. It'll get just about there.

1166
01:12:57,396 --> 01:13:02,095
MARISHA: To the edge? If it looks like it's not
going to land in the acid, and extinguish it or

1167
01:13:02,095 --> 01:13:03,368
something weird?

1168
01:13:03,368 --> 01:13:05,545
MATT: It looks like it'll probably land in the
acid.

1169
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:06,741
MARISHA: Would it extinguish it?

1170
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:07,797
MATT: Probably.

1171
01:13:07,797 --> 01:13:09,299
MARISHA: Then I'll keep it there on the edge.

1172
01:13:09,299 --> 01:13:15,076
MATT: Next round, it can. It doesn't have the
movement for the full jump, unfortunately. So it's

1173
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:18,734
right there on the edge (fire noises) angrily
burning. I need you to make a concentration check,

1174
01:13:18,734 --> 01:13:22,117
by the way, with advantage, for the damage that
Grog hit you.

1175
01:13:22,117 --> 01:13:27,794
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take that. 16. What do I have
to get over?

1176
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:31,685
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, and you
have to beat half his damage that he did to you.

1177
01:13:31,685 --> 01:13:33,198
MARISHA: So he did 25 damage.

1178
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:34,419
MATT: So 12, half.

1179
01:13:34,419 --> 01:13:35,626
MARISHA: So yeah, I'm good.

1180
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:38,088
MATT: That ends your turn, Keyleth. Taryon!

1181
01:13:38,088 --> 01:13:48,523
SAM: Oh, hi. I'm going to read my Scroll of Fire
Shield, setting it to a warm shield that will

1182
01:13:48,523 --> 01:13:53,507
protect me from all cold damage and last for ten
minutes.

1183
01:13:53,507 --> 01:13:58,211
TRAVIS: No one can hurt you in there anyway,
right?

1184
01:13:58,211 --> 01:14:00,165
SAM: Oh, but when I get out.

1185
01:14:00,165 --> 01:14:05,573
MATT: Wait, so your Scroll of Fire Shield, you
said?

1186
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:06,768
SAM: Fire Shield.

1187
01:14:06,768 --> 01:14:15,858
MATT: Okay, yeah, that's ten minutes. Not
concentration. So you said warm shield, which

1188
01:14:15,858 --> 01:14:17,328
gives you resistance to cold damage?

1189
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:18,278
SAM: Correct.

1190
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:18,949
MATT: Okay.

1191
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:22,244
SAM: That's what I want, because I'm already
resistant to fire damage.

1192
01:14:22,244 --> 01:14:30,467
And then I'll roll my ball.

1193
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:33,130
MATT: All right, you've got 40 feet of movement.

1194
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:36,474
SAM: I'm just going towards that corner.

1195
01:14:36,474 --> 01:14:37,583
MATT: Here?

1196
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:52,410
SAM: No, top right. And I'll also pull out my rod
and I'll say, crossbow!

1197
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:56,068
MATT: (clang) Turns into a nice crossbow.

1198
01:14:56,068 --> 01:14:57,463
SAM: And I'll load it with a bolt.

1199
01:14:57,463 --> 01:15:03,157
MATT: All right. (clicking) That's your turn? All
right! Top of the round.

1200
01:15:03,157 --> 01:15:04,496
Percy, what are you doing?

1201
01:15:04,496 --> 01:15:05,839
TALIESIN: Pulling around the corner.

1202
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:07,015
MATT: Around here?

1203
01:15:07,015 --> 01:15:07,918
TALIESIN: Yep.

1204
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:09,074
MATT: All right. You turn the corner.

1205
01:15:09,074 --> 01:15:10,831
TALIESIN: Casting Hex on Grog.

1206
01:15:10,831 --> 01:15:17,217
MATT: Grog is now hexed and on fire.

1207
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:29,795
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to take a sharpshooter
shot and add a point of grit for an aimed shot to

1208
01:15:29,795 --> 01:15:34,257
the legs. Actually, does that make that harder for
me to shoot him later?

1209
01:15:34,257 --> 01:15:35,950
TRAVIS: I have pretty big legs.

1210
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:38,608
TALIESIN: No, I mean if you're prone. I can still
shoot him just fine.

1211
01:15:38,608 --> 01:15:42,826
LAURA: Not with sharpshooter, I think. If they're
prone, we don't take disadvantage, right?

1212
01:15:42,826 --> 01:15:45,166
MATT: If they're prone, an attack roll against the
creature has advantage if they're within five

1213
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:48,680
feet. Otherwise it's disadvantage. If the person
is prone, it's harder

1214
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,017
for you to hit with ranged weapons.

1215
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:53,076
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to hold on that
grit, and I'm instead going to use a piercing shot

1216
01:15:53,076 --> 01:16:03,771
with sharpshooter. So for shot number one, with
Animus, sharpshooter. Oh, for fuck's sake.

1217
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:05,199
TRAVIS: Is that a misfire?

1218
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,811
TALIESIN: It's another misfire.

1219
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:12,057
MATT: This is not very Percy of you.

1220
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:19,046
TALIESIN: No. So that needs to be picked up.
That's fine. Irritated, I pull out Bad News and

1221
01:16:19,046 --> 01:16:20,271
take another shot.

1222
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:21,684
MATT: Okay. Is this also piercing?

1223
01:16:21,684 --> 01:16:23,027
TALIESIN: This is also piercing.

1224
01:16:23,027 --> 01:16:24,270
MATT: So that's another grit spent.

1225
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:33,350
TALIESIN: Another grit spent. Oh, thank you.
God damn it... That's better. 22?

1226
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,732
MATT: 22, Grog?

1227
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:36,313
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that hits. Sorry.

1228
01:16:36,313 --> 01:16:39,447
MATT: So you get to also roll an attack against
Vex, as well.

1229
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:40,834
TALIESIN: Yes.

1230
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:46,818
MATT: Basically, the shot goes through both of
you. It goes through Grog's shoulder (explosion)

1231
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:50,099
and has enough weight to actually impact and hit
Vex in the same shot.

1232
01:16:50,099 --> 01:16:53,273
TALIESIN: Thankfully, it can't misfire when I do
this. 16.

1233
01:16:53,273 --> 01:16:54,496
LAURA: No.

1234
01:16:54,496 --> 01:16:59,832
MATT: So you watch as the muscle of the shoulder
explodes, and in that brief second you dodge your

1235
01:16:59,832 --> 01:17:03,949
head out of the way, and watch as the ball goes
(whoosh) and skims the edge of your cheek. A

1236
01:17:03,949 --> 01:17:06,466
little blood goes (flick) down the side.

1237
01:17:06,466 --> 01:17:10,235
LAURA: I glare at Percy, from under Grog's
armpit.

1238
01:17:10,235 --> 01:17:13,203
MATT: You glare at him through the hole in his
shoulder, Tombstone-style.

1239
01:17:13,203 --> 01:17:17,329
TRAVIS: Grog doesn't understand why you're so mad
at his shoulder.

1240
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:29,548
TALIESIN: Aw, shit. So that's (counting). That's
33 points of piercing damage.

1241
01:17:29,548 --> 01:17:33,558
MATT: 33 points of piercing damage. That's 16.

1242
01:17:33,558 --> 01:17:37,681
TALIESIN: Plus four necrotic damage.

1243
01:17:37,681 --> 01:17:39,634
MATT: Four necrotic, not halved.

1244
01:17:39,634 --> 01:17:46,865
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take my last shot.
Actually, I'm going to take a Retort shot, because

1245
01:17:46,865 --> 01:17:53,372
this is the fucking day I'm having, and I'm going
to burn another grit, and I'm going to try and

1246
01:17:53,372 --> 01:17:55,653
knock him prone, because you're welcome.

1247
01:17:55,653 --> 01:17:58,942
TRAVIS: You just have a thing for me today.

1248
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:10,965
TALIESIN: That, too. This is another sharpshooter
with Retort. Ugh, that's a 16.

1249
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:13,343
MARISHA: Snitch is failing you tonight.

1250
01:18:13,343 --> 01:18:16,343
TALIESIN: 16 to hit.

1251
01:18:16,343 --> 01:18:17,542
TRAVIS: Misses.

1252
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:18,693
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

1253
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:23,839
MATT: This time you turn around and see Percy
there. He pulls out the Retort shot, and you're

1254
01:18:23,839 --> 01:18:26,589
like (whoosh) and duck right out of the way.

1255
01:18:26,589 --> 01:18:31,291
TALIESIN: I'm diving back behind the bloody
doorway, goddamn it.

1256
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,884
MATT: Okay. That's about the extent of your
movement, there.

1257
01:18:33,884 --> 01:18:35,567
TALIESIN: Yep. That did not go well.

1258
01:18:35,567 --> 01:18:37,786
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn.

1259
01:18:37,786 --> 01:18:47,439
TALIESIN: Yep. Oh, you have a disadvantage on
wisdom saving throws right now. Wisdom checks.

1260
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:49,796
TRAVIS: Because of Hex? Wisdom saves?

1261
01:18:49,796 --> 01:18:55,863
MATT: Not saving throws, checks. So insight,
perception, things like that.

1262
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:58,270
TRAVIS: Most things that I normally suck balls at
anyway.

1263
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,281
TALIESIN: I want to make sure you really suck at
them right now.

1264
01:19:00,281 --> 01:19:11,550
MATT: All right. The pillars that you see in the
center here begin to (vibration) emit that weird,

1265
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:17,821
vibrating hum again, and you feel, Keyleth, as the
gravitational pull warps around you but doesn't

1266
01:19:17,821 --> 01:19:21,056
affect your form, because of your Freedom of
Movement.

1267
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,592
TALIESIN: Like the Matrix.

1268
01:19:24,592 --> 01:19:34,279
MATT: However, Trinket seems to (groans) be pulled
down by the gravity of it. You watch as Doty's

1269
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:40,318
form on the ground across the way, (crack) gravity
crushes a little further in towards the stone.

1270
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:43,985
TRAVIS: Is it anything inside of the four pillars
or in circles around each pillar?

1271
01:19:43,985 --> 01:19:52,056
MATT: It seems to be radial around each pillar.
All right. Vex, you're up.

1272
01:19:52,056 --> 01:19:55,125
TALIESIN: I take two psychic damage on top of
that. I forgot about that.

1273
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,731
LAURA: I'm going to put myself out.

1274
01:19:56,731 --> 01:20:01,320
MATT: Okay. So you put yourself out as an action?
Okay. First thing, at the top of your round, you

1275
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,734
take four points of fire damage. You spend the
action to put yourself out, so you are now no

1276
01:20:06,734 --> 01:20:07,969
longer on fire.

1277
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,595
LAURA: I'm going to disengage.

1278
01:20:09,595 --> 01:20:10,911
MATT: That's a bonus action. From Grog?

1279
01:20:10,911 --> 01:20:15,432
LAURA: Yes. And I'm going to kick off the ground
and fly up as high as I can.

1280
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:18,760
TRAVIS: You can disengage now? Son of a bitch.

1281
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:28,089
MATT: Rogues, man. So you can get up about...
we'll say 40 feet. Yeah, you're up near the top,

1282
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,189
straight up.

1283
01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:33,067
LAURA: I want to be over the roof of the building
below me.

1284
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:46,380
MATT: Okay, so you get a little ways over. We'll
say about... there. Ends your turn?

1285
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,112
Grog, you're up.

1286
01:20:48,112 --> 01:20:49,520
TRAVIS: How high is Vex?

1287
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,243
MATT: She's about 40 feet up from you right now.

1288
01:20:52,243 --> 01:21:01,061
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm on fire.

1289
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:05,561
MATT: Yeah. So you take three points of fire
damage, reduced to one.

1290
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:19,834
TRAVIS: I am going to stay on fire, because fuck
it, and I am going to use my max speed to advance

1291
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:21,258
towards Percy.

1292
01:21:21,258 --> 01:21:33,270
MATT: Okay. So you turn. All right, you're
advancing towards Percy. (counting)

1293
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:40,238
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I use my Boots
of Feral Leaping to jump 20 feet horizontally in

1294
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:42,068
the direction of Percy?

1295
01:21:42,068 --> 01:21:43,681
MATT: Yes, you can.

1296
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:45,912
TALIESIN: All right.

1297
01:21:45,912 --> 01:21:50,109
MATT: Go ahead and roll your check to see if you
succeed or not.

1298
01:21:50,109 --> 01:21:57,484
TRAVIS: Yeah. 19.

1299
01:21:57,484 --> 01:22:04,496
MATT: You land right on the opposite side of
Percy. We'll push this open just a little bit to

1300
01:22:04,496 --> 01:22:10,226
get your placement as you slam into the ground
right next to him. (heavy impact). All of a

1301
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:17,304
sudden, Percival, you're standing against the wall
and you hear (footsteps). Nothing. (explosion)

1302
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:22,784
Right to the right of you, the sudden slam of
stone, as the behemoth goliath Grog lands next

1303
01:22:22,784 --> 01:22:28,500
to you, grinning, blood pouring out of the bullet
wound in his shoulder, big smile.

1304
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:36,936
TRAVIS: Can I stick my finger in the bullet wound
hole and taste it and go, hi. And can I take all

1305
01:22:36,936 --> 01:22:41,505
three attacks, reckless, great weapon master, the
whole smash.

1306
01:22:41,505 --> 01:22:43,899
MATT: Yes, you may.

1307
01:22:43,899 --> 01:22:45,960
SAM: If that was the real Percy!

1308
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,732
TRAVIS: I know! Some phantom bastard.

1309
01:22:48,732 --> 01:22:51,238
TALIESIN: I'm only nine hit points down.

1310
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:56,778
TRAVIS: Oh, this is the hammer, so I don't have
great weapon master.

1311
01:22:56,778 --> 01:22:59,408
MATT: No, you took Blood Axe, didn't you?

1312
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,559
TALIESIN: No, you went to hammer.

1313
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:06,124
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been using the hammer. 28.

1314
01:23:06,124 --> 01:23:08,459
TALIESIN: 28 hits.

1315
01:23:08,459 --> 01:23:17,323
TRAVIS: Good to hear. That's a 26 for the first
one.

1316
01:23:17,323 --> 01:23:19,390
MATT: 26 points of damage to you.

1317
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,623
TALIESIN: 26 points of damage? Okay.

1318
01:23:21,623 --> 01:23:25,403
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

1319
01:23:25,403 --> 01:23:27,014
TALIESIN: Fuck.

1320
01:23:27,014 --> 01:23:36,049
TRAVIS: (giggling) I don't know what's happening.
That's not part of the plan. Hey, that's okay,

1321
01:23:36,049 --> 01:23:38,362
that's only a two, plus a lot.

1322
01:23:38,362 --> 01:23:42,882
MATT: So you rolled a what? What did you roll for
damage?

1323
01:23:42,882 --> 01:23:46,164
TRAVIS: Well, the dice landed on a two, plus my
modifier.

1324
01:23:46,164 --> 01:23:48,955
MATT: Well, hold on. What level fighter are you?

1325
01:23:48,955 --> 01:23:51,503
TRAVIS: Two?

1326
01:23:51,503 --> 01:23:53,679
MATT: Right, which means...

1327
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,651
TRAVIS: Oh, I can re-roll a one or two for
damage.

1328
01:23:55,651 --> 01:23:58,157
MATT: Yep. That's the great weapon fighting.

1329
01:23:58,157 --> 01:23:59,765
TALIESIN: Fuck, dude. All right.

1330
01:23:59,765 --> 01:24:00,929
TRAVIS: Thank you, Matthew.

1331
01:24:00,929 --> 01:24:02,985
MATT: You haven't used that yet, really.

1332
01:24:02,985 --> 01:24:07,519
TRAVIS: That's cocked. That's an eight.

1333
01:24:07,519 --> 01:24:17,008
SAM: He likes to hit things.

1334
01:24:17,008 --> 01:24:19,395
TRAVIS: 72 points of damage.

1335
01:24:19,395 --> 01:24:22,537
TALIESIN: Is that everything so far? Is that
rolled into what you just did?

1336
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:24,183
TRAVIS: That's just the second hit.

1337
01:24:24,183 --> 01:24:25,996
MATT: Wait, so how much is that?

1338
01:24:25,996 --> 01:24:29,165
TRAVIS: Well, it was a 24. 24 points of damage.

1339
01:24:29,165 --> 01:24:31,594
MATT: You double the dice, not the bonus.

1340
01:24:31,594 --> 01:24:35,313
TRAVIS: Double the dice. Okay. Not the modifier,
too?

1341
01:24:35,313 --> 01:24:41,119
MATT: No, just the dice. So you rolled an eight,
so it's 16, plus the modifier.

1342
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:47,898
TRAVIS: 32.

1343
01:24:47,898 --> 01:24:49,970
MATT: Plus your brutal critical.

1344
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:51,914
TRAVIS: Which is another damage dice.

1345
01:24:51,914 --> 01:24:58,485
MATT: Which is another three additional damage
dice at level 17, Grog. Well, no, because you're

1346
01:24:58,485 --> 01:25:01,116
not a level 17 barbarian, so it is two. You're
right.

1347
01:25:01,116 --> 01:25:06,466
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah. That's a ten. That's a nine.

1348
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:10,025
MATT: So, that's two. An additional 19 to the 30.

1349
01:25:10,025 --> 01:25:11,517
SAM: 51.

1350
01:25:11,517 --> 01:25:14,364
TALIESIN: 51 points, so I'm at 26. 51.

1351
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:16,522
TRAVIS: Third.

1352
01:25:16,522 --> 01:25:22,571
TALIESIN: I have a Hail Mary at the end of this.
We'll see how it goes.

1353
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:24,113
TRAVIS: 27 to hit?

1354
01:25:24,113 --> 01:25:25,746
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

1355
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:30,354
TRAVIS: That's only 19 points of damage.

1356
01:25:30,354 --> 01:25:35,125
TALIESIN: Okay, I actually have to do the math to
see. I don't think I'm unconscious. No, I'm not,

1357
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:36,243
but that hurt.

1358
01:25:36,243 --> 01:25:38,097
MARISHA: You're close, though.

1359
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:40,595
SAM: That was 76 points of damage.

1360
01:25:40,595 --> 01:25:44,000
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the math with a
calculator--

1361
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,918
MATT: 76 plus 19? Right? The last hit was 19
points of damage? So 76 total before that.

1362
01:25:50,918 --> 01:26:01,036
TALIESIN: 26, 51, and 19. I've taken 105 points of
damage. I have 35 points remaining.

1363
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:03,628
SAM: He's fine!

1364
01:26:03,628 --> 01:26:06,009
TALIESIN: I'm at 35.

1365
01:26:06,009 --> 01:26:08,761
MATT: He did 96, wait.

1366
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:11,145
TALIESIN: I'm at 140 points. I have 140 hit
points.

1367
01:26:11,145 --> 01:26:12,954
MATT: Right. Sorry, just doing the math here.

1368
01:26:12,954 --> 01:26:15,696
TALIESIN: I also had nine points of damage from
psychic damage from my own fucking gun.

1369
01:26:15,696 --> 01:26:23,525
MATT: Oh, total! I see. Okay. Grog, not a bad
round. You did 96 points of damage!

1370
01:26:23,525 --> 01:26:28,456
TRAVIS: (heavy footfalls, impact noise)

1371
01:26:28,456 --> 01:26:33,414
MATT: All right! So, that's Grog's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

1372
01:26:33,414 --> 01:26:37,303
MARISHA: (heavy breathing) Okay, Vex is flying.

1373
01:26:37,303 --> 01:26:39,805
MATT: Vex is flying up on the top, on her broom.

1374
01:26:39,805 --> 01:26:41,383
SAM: You're all alone.

1375
01:26:41,383 --> 01:26:44,815
MARISHA: I'm going to take my bonus action, go
ahead and get this out of the way first, to get my

1376
01:26:44,815 --> 01:26:49,463
Flaming Sphere over that gap and ram it into
Trinket.

1377
01:26:49,463 --> 01:26:53,202
LAURA: You are so cruel.

1378
01:26:53,202 --> 01:26:55,519
MATT: Have Trinket roll a dexterity saving throw.

1379
01:26:55,519 --> 01:26:58,543
MARISHA: I'm a druid. I'm sorry! I feel bad about
this.

1380
01:26:58,543 --> 01:27:02,869
LAURA: 16!

1381
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:05,523
MATT: Nope! 5d6 points of fire damage on Trinket.

1382
01:27:05,523 --> 01:27:12,038
LAURA: I have a feeling this going to kill him.
Oh, and I don't have the necklace anymore!

1383
01:27:12,038 --> 01:27:13,260
MATT: Nope!

1384
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,356
SAM: Oh, so he'll just be dead?

1385
01:27:15,356 --> 01:27:17,234
LAURA: Or unconscious.

1386
01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:21,961
MARISHA: Six, 12, 18, 22 damage.

1387
01:27:21,961 --> 01:27:26,479
LAURA: 21 points is what he had. Trinket is
unconscious.

1388
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:35,160
MATT: Unconscious and burning. Smoke (sizzling)
off the burnt fur. (sad bear sounds)

1389
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,025
MARISHA: Okay, I still have my full movement,
right?

1390
01:27:37,025 --> 01:27:39,043
MATT: Full movement and action; that was just your
bonus action.

1391
01:27:39,043 --> 01:27:45,139
TRAVIS: Do I take any extra damage because I
didn't put the fire out at the end of the round?

1392
01:27:45,139 --> 01:27:52,074
MATT: No, it's at the top of your round that you
take the damage. Oh, and Percy? Roll concentration

1393
01:27:52,074 --> 01:27:53,216
checks for Hex.

1394
01:27:53,216 --> 01:27:56,263
TALIESIN: Oh, I took how many points of damage?

1395
01:27:56,263 --> 01:27:58,390
MARISHA: You could roll a natural 20 and save it.

1396
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,612
TALIESIN: I could roll a natural 20.

1397
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:02,918
MATT: So first attack, just roll higher than a 14,
we'll say.

1398
01:28:02,918 --> 01:28:04,499
TALIESIN: No.

1399
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:05,779
MATT: Okay, Hex is gone.

1400
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:07,666
TALIESIN: Hex gone.

1401
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:10,898
MATT: Hex-a-gone! All right. Keyleth, what are you
doing?

1402
01:28:10,898 --> 01:28:19,506
MARISHA: I'm going to haul ass. Do I have enough
movement if I dash, or whatever,

1403
01:28:19,506 --> 01:28:21,751
to get into that building?

1404
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:22,658
MATT: Over here?

1405
01:28:22,658 --> 01:28:23,699
MARISHA: Yeah.

1406
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:29,568
MATT: Speed of 50, right? You can try, I don't
want to tell you if you can or not. You can try to

1407
01:28:29,568 --> 01:28:30,724
figure it out.

1408
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:36,251
MARISHA: (counting) Yeah, I'll try it.

1409
01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:38,849
SAM: You're good at jumping over bodies of water.

1410
01:28:38,849 --> 01:28:46,171
MARISHA: I'm not going over water, man!
Can I peek in?

1411
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:52,275
MATT: You get just there on the inside. You see,
it's largely empty and there is a chest that's

1412
01:28:52,275 --> 01:28:54,640
currently open and looks empty.

1413
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,179
MARISHA: Cool!

1414
01:28:56,179 --> 01:29:02,572
MATT: You see, as you're running by, a large
hammer over the top of the wall on the opposite

1415
01:29:02,572 --> 01:29:16,716
side going (thuds). These heavy, wet thuds. All
right, so that's your movement. You have your

1416
01:29:16,716 --> 01:29:18,229
action, still.

1417
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:35,691
MARISHA: Oh, right! Oh my god! Okay. I'm going to
use my action to expend a level-2 spell slot to

1418
01:29:35,691 --> 01:29:45,375
heal myself. With my spell slot to heal myself in
wild shape thing.

1419
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:49,100
MATT: Right. It's a bonus action to do that, which
you already used to move your sphere.

1420
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:53,388
MARISHA: I can't use my action? I'm basically
wasting an action to do it instead.

1421
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,724
MATT: Sure.

1422
01:29:54,724 --> 01:30:04,943
MARISHA: Okay. Where are my d8s? Here they are.
That's not great.

1423
01:30:04,943 --> 01:30:07,286
I heal nine hit points in my form.

1424
01:30:07,286 --> 01:30:08,752
TRAVIS: That's great.

1425
01:30:08,752 --> 01:30:13,658
MARISHA: Thanks, man. I'm glad you're so
approving.

1426
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,783
MATT: Taryon.

1427
01:30:14,783 --> 01:30:15,796
SAM: Me?

1428
01:30:15,796 --> 01:30:18,139
MATT: Yes. You're there in the corner with your
crossbow.

1429
01:30:18,139 --> 01:30:26,018
SAM: Yep. I'm going to-- crossbow in one hand, I'm
going to take my broom and stick it between my

1430
01:30:26,018 --> 01:30:28,726
legs. Ready to go.

1431
01:30:28,726 --> 01:30:31,927
LAURA: Is there room for that? How big is that
damn orb?

1432
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,062
SAM: I don't know. Matt?

1433
01:30:33,062 --> 01:30:42,478
MATT: The broom isn't huge. You can fit it up
inside there. Take that quote out of context.

1434
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:44,384
(laughter)

1435
01:30:44,384 --> 01:30:46,962
MATT and LAURA: You can fit it up inside there.

1436
01:30:46,962 --> 01:30:52,848
SAM: And then I will continue my movement. Where
am I? Am I that thing in the corner?

1437
01:30:52,848 --> 01:30:54,586
MATT: You're right here, way over in the corner.

1438
01:30:54,586 --> 01:30:56,920
SAM: I'm going to go around the wall so nobody can
see me.

1439
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,938
MATT: Okay. Five, ten, 15.

1440
01:30:58,938 --> 01:31:13,168
SAM: Right next to the fireball of death, yeah.
I'll stay there, and then I'll try something. It's

1441
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:14,118
not going to work.

1442
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:15,348
MATT: What are you going to try?

1443
01:31:15,348 --> 01:31:16,452
SAM: I don't think it'll work.

1444
01:31:16,452 --> 01:31:17,666
MATT: What are you trying, Tary?

1445
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:26,933
SAM: Secretly, I'm going to take a patch off my
robe, a window patch, and see if I can make a

1446
01:31:26,933 --> 01:31:29,348
window to climb through the sphere.

1447
01:31:29,348 --> 01:31:33,698
(laughter)

1448
01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:39,710
SAM: I don't think so. It says no effects can pass
through the sphere. I assume no effects can affect

1449
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:41,815
the sphere, either.

1450
01:31:41,815 --> 01:31:46,364
MATT: I'm going to make a judgment call here,
based on the wording. Give me just one second.

1451
01:31:46,364 --> 01:31:49,828
TRAVIS: Can you drop it prematurely if you want
to, whenever you want?

1452
01:31:49,828 --> 01:31:55,772
SAM: No, I'm trapped in here. Trapped for a
minute.

1453
01:31:55,772 --> 01:31:58,949
TRAVIS: You're in the bomb shelter. You don't
know.

1454
01:31:58,949 --> 01:32:01,395
SAM: They'll let me out when they're ready.

1455
01:32:01,395 --> 01:32:10,633
MATT: Can pass through the sphere...

1456
01:32:10,633 --> 01:32:14,268
SAM: I don't think it's going to work.

1457
01:32:14,268 --> 01:32:17,274
TALIESIN: It's kind of brilliant.

1458
01:32:17,274 --> 01:32:24,037
MATT: I'm going to say sure. It's not passing
through it, it's creating

1459
01:32:24,037 --> 01:32:28,575
a passable window in the sphere.

1460
01:32:28,575 --> 01:32:29,993
TRAVIS: I like the ruling.

1461
01:32:29,993 --> 01:32:31,845
MATT: It makes sense.

1462
01:32:31,845 --> 01:32:33,717
SAM: I'm going to hover out a little.

1463
01:32:33,717 --> 01:32:38,105
MATT: So you go ahead and pull it off and slap it,
and you watch as a little two-foot-by-two-foot

1464
01:32:38,105 --> 01:32:39,339
window opens up.

1465
01:32:39,339 --> 01:32:43,514
SAM: I'm not going to leave yet. I'm staying
in the safety of the sphere for at least one more

1466
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:46,334
round, ready to go.

1467
01:32:46,334 --> 01:32:49,141
LAURA: I really hope the fire pillar goes off.

1468
01:32:49,141 --> 01:32:50,574
SAM: I'm still in the sphere!

1469
01:32:50,574 --> 01:32:52,218
LAURA: Yeah, but you've got a hole in it.

1470
01:32:52,218 --> 01:32:54,025
SAM: Yeah, I realize that.

1471
01:32:54,025 --> 01:32:57,418
TRAVIS: (explosion, screams)

1472
01:32:57,418 --> 01:33:00,668
MARISHA: Come on, fire pillars, come on!

1473
01:33:00,668 --> 01:33:15,099
MATT: All righty. Yeah, technically... nah,
it's too late now to retcon that. My fault.

1474
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:19,414
All right, so. That ends your turn, Tary?
Percival, you're up.

1475
01:33:19,414 --> 01:33:25,436
TALIESIN: Oh here's a hail Mary. First thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to

1476
01:33:25,436 --> 01:33:30,023
down a potion of greater healing, which is how
many d4?

1477
01:33:30,023 --> 01:33:33,249
MATT: Greater healing is 4d4 plus four.

1478
01:33:33,249 --> 01:33:41,450
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four. Let's make that happen.
That's okay.

1479
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,609
MARISHA: Yeah, that's not a bad roll.

1480
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:47,831
TALIESIN: 15 points of healing.

1481
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:51,678
MARISHA: Yeah, not bad.

1482
01:33:51,678 --> 01:33:54,183
TALIESIN: That's one hit from Grog that I can now
take.

1483
01:33:54,183 --> 01:33:56,324
MARISHA: Yeah, might keep you alive.

1484
01:33:56,324 --> 01:34:01,722
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and hit him with
Diplomacy. Since I'm technically in grappling

1485
01:34:01,722 --> 01:34:12,453
distance, I can't shoot, and if I try to move,
he's going to hit me, so I'm going to attempt to hit

1486
01:34:12,453 --> 01:34:14,655
him with Diplomacy and see what happens.

1487
01:34:14,655 --> 01:34:15,850
MATT: Okay. All right.

1488
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:18,878
TALIESIN: What is that, since I haven't used
it...

1489
01:34:18,878 --> 01:34:21,155
MATT: What does it say on the card?

1490
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:31,103
TALIESIN: Where is the card? I have a lot of them
out. It's a dex-based unarmed melee attack. Just

1491
01:34:31,103 --> 01:34:32,205
dex modifier?

1492
01:34:32,205 --> 01:34:38,935
MATT: Yeah, just dex modifier. Well, no. I'd say
add your proficiency, as well, because you built

1493
01:34:38,935 --> 01:34:39,795
the thing.

1494
01:34:39,795 --> 01:34:47,629
TALIESIN: Add the proficiency bonus? Okay, thank
you. That's less of a hail Mary. Slightly. Oh my

1495
01:34:47,629 --> 01:34:49,107
god. 14.

1496
01:34:49,107 --> 01:34:51,516
MARISHA: Oh, buddy! No.

1497
01:34:51,516 --> 01:34:54,459
TALIESIN: I've rolled three ones and a two this
game.

1498
01:34:54,459 --> 01:34:55,902
TRAVIS: That's unreal.

1499
01:34:55,902 --> 01:34:57,234
MATT: So that's one attack.

1500
01:34:57,234 --> 01:35:01,011
TALIESIN: Another round with it?

1501
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:06,837
MATT: Yeah. So Percy's (frustrated grunting)
trying to reach out towards you.

1502
01:35:06,837 --> 01:35:09,474
TALIESIN: 17?

1503
01:35:09,474 --> 01:35:10,990
TRAVIS: That's my AC.

1504
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:20,960
TALIESIN: Okay! That's 2d12 electrical damage.

1505
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:25,269
MATT: Lightning damage to you, so that's halved.

1506
01:35:25,269 --> 01:35:29,742
TALIESIN: That's 24 points of lightning damage.

1507
01:35:29,742 --> 01:35:31,336
MATT: So you take 12 points.

1508
01:35:31,336 --> 01:35:38,774
TALIESIN: Guess what. Make a constitution saving
throw.

1509
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:41,227
TRAVIS: Which I have disadvantage on?

1510
01:35:41,227 --> 01:35:43,289
LAURA, MATT, and TALIESIN: No.

1511
01:35:43,289 --> 01:35:44,955
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

1512
01:35:44,955 --> 01:35:46,804
TALIESIN: You actually no longer have
disadvantage.

1513
01:35:46,804 --> 01:35:48,204
MATT: Yeah, Hex went away.

1514
01:35:48,204 --> 01:35:51,060
TRAVIS: Okay. That's a 27.

1515
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,567
TALIESIN: You have a 27?

1516
01:35:52,567 --> 01:35:54,787
TRAVIS: My constitution is amazing. Fuck.

1517
01:35:54,787 --> 01:35:56,155
MARISHA: He's a fucking barbarian.

1518
01:35:56,155 --> 01:35:57,676
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so fucked.

1519
01:35:57,676 --> 01:36:01,340
SAM: Does it do anything to him?

1520
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,918
TALIESIN: Nope. It doesn't do what I was hoping it
was going to do.

1521
01:36:03,918 --> 01:36:05,548
That would've saved my goddamned life.

1522
01:36:05,548 --> 01:36:07,193
MATT: If he would've rolled low, that would've
saved you, probably.

1523
01:36:07,193 --> 01:36:08,338
TALIESIN: Yeah, if he had rolled low.

1524
01:36:08,338 --> 01:36:09,661
MARISHA: Does he take any damage?

1525
01:36:09,661 --> 01:36:15,098
TALIESIN: He takes 12 points of lightning damage.
What the fuck else am I going to do?

1526
01:36:15,098 --> 01:36:17,864
MARISHA: That's just Grog putting his finger in
the socket.

1527
01:36:17,864 --> 01:36:24,512
TALIESIN: I can run like a motherfucker. Let's
see.

1528
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:33,397
TRAVIS: I had an action surge I forgot about last
time, so consider this borrowed time.

1529
01:36:33,397 --> 01:36:39,036
MATT: Technically, you had advantage on your
attacks against him because he used reckless.

1530
01:36:39,104 --> 01:36:43,970
TALIESIN: But I can't use my gun, can I? Oh wait,
I would've had advantage, but I didn't get

1531
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,439
advantage on the--

1532
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:48,651
MATT: You would've had advantage, so the two
attack rolls we'll say were one attack.

1533
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:52,301
TALIESIN: I can't hit him with my gun, but I can
still hit him with my sword.

1534
01:36:52,301 --> 01:36:54,232
MATT: Well, you can hit him with the gun. You just
have disadvantage with the strikes, but you have

1535
01:36:54,232 --> 01:36:55,783
advantage, so it would be just a straight roll.

1536
01:36:55,783 --> 01:37:00,534
TALIESIN: Okay. So I have two more sword attacks,
and then I've got to figure out some shit. Let's

1537
01:37:00,534 --> 01:37:01,670
take two--

1538
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:03,102
LAURA: Wait, you have four attacks?

1539
01:37:03,102 --> 01:37:05,523
TALIESIN: I have three attacks. But I had
advantage, so technically that was one attack.

1540
01:37:05,523 --> 01:37:06,937
LAURA: Oh!

1541
01:37:06,937 --> 01:37:09,019
TALIESIN: So I'm going to take two sword attacks.

1542
01:37:09,019 --> 01:37:11,935
TRAVIS: Come on, man. You got this.

1543
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:19,339
TALIESIN: No, I don't. That's a 27 piercing.

1544
01:37:19,339 --> 01:37:22,723
MARISHA: Wait, are you rolling damage?

1545
01:37:22,723 --> 01:37:30,421
TALIESIN: No, I'm sorry. That's to hit. I'm sorry,
my brain is-- you're scaring me. 25 to hit and 21

1546
01:37:30,421 --> 01:37:31,694
to hit, so both hit?

1547
01:37:31,694 --> 01:37:32,986
MATT: Both hit, yeah.

1548
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:35,035
SAM: Most of your war paint is gone, by the way,
Travis.

1549
01:37:35,035 --> 01:37:36,623
MARISHA: How did that happen?

1550
01:37:36,623 --> 01:37:38,534
TRAVIS: I absorb things that make me stronger.

1551
01:37:38,534 --> 01:37:41,430
(laughter)

1552
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:47,545
TALIESIN: (counting) 22 points of piercing
damage.

1553
01:37:47,545 --> 01:37:50,373
MATT: Okay, so 11 points piercing damage, Grog.

1554
01:37:50,373 --> 01:37:51,831
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1555
01:37:51,831 --> 01:38:02,773
TALIESIN: And I'm going to burn an action surge.
You can't use an action to disengage unless you

1556
01:38:02,773 --> 01:38:04,400
have it. I'm just fucked, aren't I?

1557
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,472
MATT: Correct. You can still run, but he gets to
swipe at you.

1558
01:38:06,472 --> 01:38:10,778
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my heal with that
action surge. I'm going to heal up.

1559
01:38:10,778 --> 01:38:20,640
MARISHA: Going to hold down the fort? You're
looking down the barrel, man.

1560
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:32,070
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. That's awful. 14 points of
healing, but it'll get me away.

1561
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:34,107
TRAVIS: Can I take my retaliation strike?

1562
01:38:34,107 --> 01:38:35,410
MATT: Yes, you can.

1563
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:39,183
SAM: Oh no.

1564
01:38:39,183 --> 01:38:41,372
TRAVIS: 26?

1565
01:38:41,372 --> 01:38:44,242
TALIESIN: 26 to hit? Hits.

1566
01:38:44,242 --> 01:38:48,385
MARISHA: So fucking nonchalant, like he doesn't
know.

1567
01:38:48,385 --> 01:38:50,112
TRAVIS: 24.

1568
01:38:50,112 --> 01:38:57,038
TALIESIN: 24. Okay. That's his reaction, so I can
run now.

1569
01:38:57,038 --> 01:38:58,156
TRAVIS: You may flee.

1570
01:38:58,156 --> 01:38:59,813
TALIESIN: Oh. Well, that's fine.

1571
01:38:59,813 --> 01:39:01,299
MATT: (laughs) You can flee.

1572
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:05,053
TRAVIS: Or you can stand here and face it, like a
man.

1573
01:39:05,053 --> 01:39:16,355
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'll be laughing when I'm far
away from you. I've got to get some distance. I'm

1574
01:39:16,355 --> 01:39:18,843
going to start running straight up the tower.

1575
01:39:18,843 --> 01:39:20,337
MARISHA: He can still hit you if you run.

1576
01:39:20,337 --> 01:39:21,746
TRAVIS: I already did.

1577
01:39:21,746 --> 01:39:26,263
MATT: (counting) That's as far as you can get with
your movement.

1578
01:39:26,263 --> 01:39:27,735
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1579
01:39:27,735 --> 01:39:30,735
SAM: Is there an entrance to the tower there?

1580
01:39:30,735 --> 01:39:32,480
MATT: There's two doors and a ladder.

1581
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,861
TALIESIN: I don't need a ladder, though.

1582
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:36,211
MATT: No, you can run up the side.

1583
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:38,318
TALIESIN: I don't want to go around that wall. I
want to go <i>up</i> that wall.

1584
01:39:38,318 --> 01:39:39,618
MATT: Up this wall?

1585
01:39:39,618 --> 01:39:40,714
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1586
01:39:40,714 --> 01:39:42,406
MATT: So you're right there.

1587
01:39:42,406 --> 01:39:44,484
SAM: Cat on a hot tin roof.

1588
01:39:44,484 --> 01:39:46,251
MATT: That's your turn, Percy?

1589
01:39:46,251 --> 01:39:48,727
TALIESIN: That's the end of my fucking turn.

1590
01:39:48,727 --> 01:39:57,161
MATT: The electrical towers at the top cycle
(electricity noises) and flash with a bolt of

1591
01:39:57,161 --> 01:40:04,107
energy. Nobody is in the radius to be affected; no
effect. That brings us to Vex. Up at the top, as

1592
01:40:04,107 --> 01:40:08,529
you flew up there on the broom, you felt your head
and shoulders bump and hit the ceiling, and you're

1593
01:40:08,693 --> 01:40:10,573
like, shit. Arrows ready.

1594
01:40:10,573 --> 01:40:18,788
LAURA: Welp. I can see Percy, so I'm going to
Hunter's Mark him.

1595
01:40:18,788 --> 01:40:20,488
TALIESIN: All right.

1596
01:40:20,488 --> 01:40:22,843
LAURA: And then I'm going to attack him.

1597
01:40:22,843 --> 01:40:28,097
SAM: The love of your life. Bathtub buddy.

1598
01:40:28,097 --> 01:40:34,628
LAURA: This first attack. Well, let's see. Oh
yeah, that hits. Yeah, that definitely hits, 31.

1599
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:38,535
And it's a bramble shot.

1600
01:40:38,535 --> 01:40:39,782
MATT: Okay.

1601
01:40:39,782 --> 01:40:43,822
(laughter)

1602
01:40:43,822 --> 01:40:48,325
LAURA: So you have to roll a strength DC.

1603
01:40:48,325 --> 01:40:51,026
TALIESIN: I have to roll a strength check against
bramble?

1604
01:40:51,026 --> 01:40:55,262
MATT: First, roll damage for everything.

1605
01:40:55,262 --> 01:40:56,527
LAURA: For the regular?

1606
01:40:56,527 --> 01:40:57,654
MATT: For all of it.

1607
01:40:57,654 --> 01:41:00,834
LAURA: Oh right. Okay, wait. That's an additional
4d8.

1608
01:41:00,834 --> 01:41:07,524
TALIESIN: Shit. Yeah, no. I'm fucked, anyway.

1609
01:41:07,524 --> 01:41:09,112
SAM: Maybe not.

1610
01:41:09,112 --> 01:41:12,683
TRAVIS: Hey, man. Better to be done by your lover
than by me. I left that action surge out.

1611
01:41:12,683 --> 01:41:17,215
TALIESIN: Oh, I have another action surge that I
didn't-- I was hoping.

1612
01:41:17,215 --> 01:41:26,661
LAURA: (adding) 38, plus six lightning damage.

1613
01:41:26,661 --> 01:41:34,215
TALIESIN: 38 plus six lightning damage? And then
I'm going to take... ugh, this is the worst I've

1614
01:41:34,215 --> 01:41:39,968
ever rolled in my life. 38 plus six lightning. I'm
going to bring that down to 25 points of damage.

1615
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,206
MATT: From?

1616
01:41:41,206 --> 01:41:47,886
TALIESIN: From the Gloves of Missile Snaring. So
38 down to 25. Plus six lightning damage?

1617
01:41:47,886 --> 01:41:50,264
Still alive.

1618
01:41:50,264 --> 01:41:56,397
MATT: As you're on the wall, you feel the sense,
this burning in your ears, and you glance up just

1619
01:41:56,397 --> 01:42:01,503
as you watch an arrow (arrow sound) come towards
you and as it bursts open, this series of tendrils

1620
01:42:01,503 --> 01:42:05,933
of vines, you reach over and grab and stop the
arrow, somewhat, before it pierces into you, but

1621
01:42:05,933 --> 01:42:10,491
you still manage to pull it back and the vines
begin to ensnare around you. Go ahead and roll a

1622
01:42:10,491 --> 01:42:15,891
strength saving throw, I believe?

1623
01:42:15,891 --> 01:42:17,055
TALIESIN: 16?

1624
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:20,401
MATT: DC 17. They (whoosh) wrap around you and you
find yourself--

1625
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:24,000
TALIESIN: Actually, this is better. I'm so sorry.
Strength saving throw, 22.

1626
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,160
MATT: That does succeed. So as they wrap around
you, you (strained grunting) and burst off of them

1627
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:33,730
and the arrow breaks out and they all turn gray
and wither into dust as they hit the ground.

1628
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:36,553
LAURA: You're so strong, darling. I'm so
impressed.

1629
01:42:36,553 --> 01:42:38,598
Right as I throw another arrow at him.

1630
01:42:38,598 --> 01:42:41,742
(laughter)

1631
01:42:41,742 --> 01:42:43,884
LAURA: That's a 25 to hit.

1632
01:42:43,884 --> 01:42:45,517
MATT and TALIESIN: That hits.

1633
01:42:45,517 --> 01:42:49,745
LAURA: I'm going to do another... no, I'm not. I'm
not going to do a bramble shot on him. I'm just

1634
01:42:49,745 --> 01:42:50,961
going to do a regular shot.

1635
01:42:50,961 --> 01:42:52,426
TALIESIN: No, it's smart.

1636
01:42:52,426 --> 01:42:54,166
LAURA: Well, yeah, he's taking half damage.

1637
01:42:54,166 --> 01:42:56,871
TALIESIN: I'm bleeding out. I'm just blood.

1638
01:42:56,871 --> 01:43:00,830
LAURA: Oh wait, do you only get to use the catch
once?

1639
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:04,292
TALIESIN: Once per turn. It's a reaction.

1640
01:43:04,292 --> 01:43:10,821
LAURA: 12, 14, 16 plus six lightning damage.

1641
01:43:10,821 --> 01:43:12,219
TALIESIN: I'm out.

1642
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:21,603
MATT: You fall unconscious and off the wall,
hitting the ground. You take three points of

1643
01:43:21,603 --> 01:43:24,489
bludgeoning damage as you hit, which is an
immediate failed death save.

1644
01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:25,918
TALIESIN: Are we doing death saves?

1645
01:43:25,918 --> 01:43:27,471
MATT: Oh yeah, that's part of this.

1646
01:43:27,471 --> 01:43:30,809
MARISHA: So you could theoretically recover and
come back.

1647
01:43:30,809 --> 01:43:34,790
MATT: Yeah, if you roll a natural 20 on your death
save. It's happened before.

1648
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:43,492
LAURA: Fuck, okay. Those are my two attacks, so
can I fly down to the ground behind the

1649
01:43:43,492 --> 01:43:50,885
building... actually, they're all over on the
other side. I'm going to drop down where I am.

1650
01:43:50,885 --> 01:43:53,713
MATT: Okay. Drop down to the roof?

1651
01:43:53,713 --> 01:44:02,337
LAURA: Yeah, to the roof. And I'm going to lay
down on the roof and use my bonus action to hide.

1652
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:07,432
MATT: Okay, you lay down on the roof, using your
bonus action to hide.

1653
01:44:07,432 --> 01:44:10,812
Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

1654
01:44:10,812 --> 01:44:12,121
LAURA: 27.

1655
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:17,189
MATT: 27. As far as you know, no one has any idea
where the hell you are. All right, that ends your

1656
01:44:17,189 --> 01:44:18,892
turn. Grog, you're up.

1657
01:44:18,892 --> 01:44:23,838
TRAVIS: I see Vex...

1658
01:44:23,838 --> 01:44:25,592
MATT: You watch her (descending noise).

1659
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:32,369
TRAVIS: But she was shooting at my quarry. I turn
the corner towards where Percy is.

1660
01:44:32,369 --> 01:44:38,723
MATT: As you lumber around, you go and see his
unconscious body there, on the ground.

1661
01:44:38,815 --> 01:44:46,643
TRAVIS: (gasps) Percy von Fredrickstein de blah,
skittles and balls and ass. What happened?

1662
01:44:46,643 --> 01:44:49,759
TALIESIN: He burns an action doing this, I
assume.

1663
01:44:49,759 --> 01:44:52,234
(laughter)

1664
01:44:52,234 --> 01:44:56,233
TRAVIS: Spin the hammer, right down on his head.

1665
01:44:56,233 --> 01:45:03,172
MATT: Okay, you move in. That's ten more feet. Go
ahead and roll, with advantage.

1666
01:45:03,172 --> 01:45:09,801
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's a 32.

1667
01:45:09,801 --> 01:45:12,724
MATT: All right. It's an auto-crit because it was
within five feet. How do you want to do this?

1668
01:45:12,799 --> 01:45:22,276
TRAVIS: I start to swing down. Did he get new
glasses? I take them. (heavy impact)

1669
01:45:22,276 --> 01:45:28,663
(laughter)

1670
01:45:28,663 --> 01:45:32,520
MATT: The whole face caves in as the hammer
scatters him like a Gallagher watermelon across

1671
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,942
the stone floor.

1672
01:45:33,942 --> 01:45:36,315
TRAVIS: Oh, I can see very well.

1673
01:45:36,315 --> 01:45:38,209
(laughter)

1674
01:45:38,209 --> 01:45:41,381
MATT: Percival is no more. First to fall.

1675
01:45:41,381 --> 01:45:43,664
TRAVIS: How much speed did I use?

1676
01:45:43,664 --> 01:45:49,699
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20.

1677
01:45:49,699 --> 01:45:51,272
TRAVIS: 20.

1678
01:45:51,272 --> 01:45:54,829
MARISHA: And the sound of the first cannon.

1679
01:45:54,829 --> 01:46:01,343
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to leap, with
the feral leaping, 20 feet toward the tower?

1680
01:46:01,343 --> 01:46:03,124
MATT: Toward the tower this way?

1681
01:46:03,124 --> 01:46:04,290
TRAVIS: Entrance, down.

1682
01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:07,115
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. Go ahead and roll for
that.

1683
01:46:07,115 --> 01:46:14,104
TRAVIS: 21.

1684
01:46:14,104 --> 01:46:19,672
MATT: You land (grunt, impact noise) right toward
the base.

1685
01:46:19,672 --> 01:46:23,061
TRAVIS: Can I use the remainder of my speed to run
up the tower?

1686
01:46:23,061 --> 01:46:24,744
MARISHA: And he's still on fire, right?

1687
01:46:24,744 --> 01:46:27,489
TRAVIS: Yep. Oh, I need to take the fire damage.

1688
01:46:27,489 --> 01:46:31,264
MATT: That's true. Last round, or just this one?

1689
01:46:31,264 --> 01:46:33,654
TRAVIS: Just this one. I took it last time.

1690
01:46:33,654 --> 01:46:36,121
MATT: That's five fire damage, reduced to two.

1691
01:46:36,121 --> 01:46:39,239
TRAVIS: Two. On fire.

1692
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:44,792
MATT: And you disappear into the center of the
tower.

1693
01:46:44,792 --> 01:46:46,696
TRAVIS: 20 feet in?

1694
01:46:46,696 --> 01:46:48,452
MATT: You get partway up the stairs.

1695
01:46:48,452 --> 01:46:49,646
TRAVIS: Is it a winding thing?

1696
01:46:49,646 --> 01:46:54,256
MATT: Yeah, it's a spiral staircase. All right,
that ends your turn, Grog. Keyleth?

1697
01:46:54,256 --> 01:46:58,402
MARISHA: Okay, I saw Vex shooting Percy?

1698
01:46:58,402 --> 01:47:03,375
MATT: No, you were inside the cusp of this
building the entire time. Glancing around there,

1699
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:08,366
you saw her up there, and make a perception
check.

1700
01:47:08,366 --> 01:47:19,911
MARISHA: Okay. 20. No, 21.

1701
01:47:19,911 --> 01:47:26,656
MATT: 21. You got the gist. You watched her
descend, but you have no idea directly where she

1702
01:47:26,656 --> 01:47:29,148
is. You know she's somewhere in this area.

1703
01:47:29,148 --> 01:47:32,874
MARISHA: Okay. So I don't see anyone?

1704
01:47:32,874 --> 01:47:36,995
MATT: You know where she is. If you have an area
something you want to do, you could probably hit

1705
01:47:36,995 --> 01:47:41,017
her, but you can't aim a specific attack directly
at her because you can't see her.

1706
01:47:41,017 --> 01:48:08,522
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to start by moving my
fire ball. Jeez. There's not a lot I can do. I saw

1707
01:48:08,522 --> 01:48:10,914
Grog run by, as well, correct?

1708
01:48:10,914 --> 01:48:16,658
MATT: You saw Grog run by this way, and that's the
last you saw. And you know that Vex is somewhere

1709
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:21,013
in this area. What do you want to do?

1710
01:48:21,013 --> 01:48:26,370
MARISHA: I'm going to move out and around on this
side, my movement over here.

1711
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:28,595
MATT: You're there.

1712
01:48:28,595 --> 01:48:35,925
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and use my bonus
action to heal a little bit more. Actually, no,

1713
01:48:35,925 --> 01:48:40,807
can I use my action to heal like last time and use
my bonus action to move my sphere?

1714
01:48:40,807 --> 01:48:50,302
MATT: Sure. Yeah, okay, go for it. Technically...
yeah, it's fine.

1715
01:48:50,302 --> 01:49:00,825
MARISHA: I'm going to do 1st-level. Five. Okay.
And then I'm going to move my sphere right in

1716
01:49:00,825 --> 01:49:02,600
front of the doorway.

1717
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:03,954
MATT: 30 feet for the sphere?

1718
01:49:03,954 --> 01:49:05,936
MARISHA: Yeah, however far it can go.

1719
01:49:05,936 --> 01:49:11,455
MATT: There, that's as far as it can get right
there. Okay, that ends your turn, Keyleth?

1720
01:49:11,455 --> 01:49:18,677
MARISHA: Do I have any more movement? I'll pop
back in the building a little bit, and that's it.

1721
01:49:18,677 --> 01:49:21,631
MATT: All righty. Taryon, your turn.

1722
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:25,683
TRAVIS: How many rounds is this? Four? Five?

1723
01:49:25,683 --> 01:49:26,795
LAURA: This is the sixth round.

1724
01:49:26,795 --> 01:49:28,067
SAM: This is the fifth round.

1725
01:49:28,067 --> 01:49:30,172
LAURA: This is the fifth round. After this will be
the sixth.

1726
01:49:30,172 --> 01:49:48,273
SAM: Invisibility. And I want to fly out of the
sphere and to a vantage point of your choosing, so

1727
01:49:48,273 --> 01:49:55,560
no one knows where I am, somewhere between 20 and
40 feet high, maybe towards the center-ish of the

1728
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:58,165
game field. Up to you where.

1729
01:49:58,165 --> 01:50:00,678
MATT: Okay, I know where you are. That's your
turn?

1730
01:50:00,678 --> 01:50:01,668
SAM: Yes.

1731
01:50:01,668 --> 01:50:02,915
MATT: Okay, Taryon.

1732
01:50:02,915 --> 01:50:04,259
TRAVIS: Do you know where?

1733
01:50:04,259 --> 01:50:07,173
SAM: No, I don't want to know where I am so you
don't know where I am.

1734
01:50:07,173 --> 01:50:08,480
LAURA: It's smart.

1735
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:13,408
(laughter)

1736
01:50:13,408 --> 01:50:18,338
MATT: No longer Percy's turn. So with that, the
braziers--

1737
01:50:18,338 --> 01:50:22,653
SAM: And Matt. Away from the things that blow up.
Was that understood?

1738
01:50:22,653 --> 01:50:29,014
MATT: Right, yes. And all the braziers flare up.
Don't affect anybody. That brings us to Vex.

1739
01:50:29,014 --> 01:50:35,948
LAURA: I'm going to take off from the roof and try
to make it to the opposite tower.

1740
01:50:35,948 --> 01:50:38,964
MATT: The opposite tower, flying over here?

1741
01:50:38,964 --> 01:50:39,917
LAURA: Yeah.

1742
01:50:39,917 --> 01:50:42,314
MATT: You make your way there.

1743
01:50:42,314 --> 01:50:44,584
LAURA: Can I see anything?

1744
01:50:44,584 --> 01:50:52,478
MATT: Make a perception check.

1745
01:50:52,732 --> 01:50:55,600
LAURA: 20.

1746
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,620
MATT: Yeah, you see the flickering flames of
Keyleth within the inside, in the very cusp of

1747
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:02,216
this. She has three-quarters cover, but you have
sharpshooter, so you ignore that.

1748
01:51:02,216 --> 01:51:09,498
LAURA: Well, then I'll try to hit her. I'm going to
attack her! That's a 27.

1749
01:51:09,498 --> 01:51:11,020
MATT and MARISHA: That hits.

1750
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:26,449
LAURA: Eight plus five is-- no, is it? No. 13? 15,
plus four lightning damage.

1751
01:51:26,449 --> 01:51:29,063
And then I'm going to do it again.

1752
01:51:29,063 --> 01:51:31,679
MATT: 17 points of damage.

1753
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:42,400
LAURA: I'm going to do a bramble shot on her,
because I only did the one. 25 to hit.

1754
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,175
MATT: 25 to hit? That hits. Damage?

1755
01:51:46,175 --> 01:52:05,097
LAURA: (counting) 32, plus three lightning
damage.

1756
01:52:05,097 --> 01:52:07,884
TRAVIS: 35, damn.

1757
01:52:07,884 --> 01:52:13,740
MATT: As the brambles wrap around her, the flames
burn them away. She's immune to being restrained.

1758
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:22,400
LAURA: Yeah, I figured. I bet Tary's up here, but
I don't know that. I'm going to use my bonus

1759
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:30,332
action to hide. I was hidden at the beginning of
the turn, but I'm assuming my movement took me out

1760
01:52:30,332 --> 01:52:36,309
of hiding. Can I use my skirmisher's stealth to
choose a quarry to stay hidden? Or I have to be

1761
01:52:36,309 --> 01:52:37,860
hidden at the top of the turn?

1762
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:42,786
MATT: At this point, yeah. We're skirting a line,
here, of watching you go up and land. You aren't

1763
01:52:42,786 --> 01:52:49,201
amongst trees in a forest. It's easy to see where
you are, vaguely.

1764
01:52:49,201 --> 01:52:50,848
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to hide.

1765
01:52:50,922 --> 01:52:53,815
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

1766
01:52:53,815 --> 01:52:56,255
LAURA: Only 18.

1767
01:52:56,255 --> 01:52:59,256
MATT: Okay, good to know. That ends Vex's turn.
Grog!

1768
01:52:59,256 --> 01:53:09,060
TRAVIS: Right. I don't see any immediate chests in
this big tower, right? It's just a stairwell?

1769
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:13,500
MATT: No, it's just stairwell. Like when you went
through the other one, it's empty, more of a

1770
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:17,310
gaining of ground and/or protective space.

1771
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:24,392
TRAVIS: All right. Live and let die,
motherfuckers! Can I run out of the tower,

1772
01:53:24,392 --> 01:53:27,518
straight towards the pool of acid?

1773
01:53:27,518 --> 01:53:35,106
MATT: You got ten feet in, so ten feet out. You still
have 40 at the doorway. There's a Flaming Sphere

1774
01:53:35,106 --> 01:53:37,148
there, which you're like, "oh, avoid!"

1775
01:53:37,148 --> 01:53:42,170
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm aiming to try and make my way to
this structure.

1776
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:48,762
MATT: 25, 30, 35, 40. You're just stepping over
the corpse of Trinket.

1777
01:53:48,762 --> 01:53:50,336
TRAVIS: Lovely.

1778
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:54,742
LAURA: Oh, I forgot he's just unconscious. He's
not dead yet. I haven't been making saving throws

1779
01:53:54,742 --> 01:53:57,660
for him.

1780
01:53:57,660 --> 01:54:01,177
MATT: He's doing okay for now. Grog, that's your
movement.

1781
01:54:01,244 --> 01:54:10,601
TRAVIS: I raise my hammer as I get to Trinket. I
don't give a shit about Trinket.

1782
01:54:10,601 --> 01:54:17,238
What square am I on?

1783
01:54:17,238 --> 01:54:24,355
MATT: You're technically right here. You have your
action, still. You can dash if you want to get all

1784
01:54:24,355 --> 01:54:27,150
the way there, or you can attack something in the
vicinity. What do you want to do?

1785
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:31,882
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll dash.

1786
01:54:31,882 --> 01:54:45,955
MATT: (counting) You get inside here and see a
small chest by the doorway there.

1787
01:54:45,955 --> 01:54:47,681
TRAVIS: Can I move to the chest?

1788
01:54:47,681 --> 01:54:50,264
MATT: You can move to the chest, but it'll take an
action to open it.

1789
01:54:50,264 --> 01:54:54,609
TRAVIS: Can I use my action surge, which I have
not used, to open the chest?

1790
01:54:54,609 --> 01:55:01,910
MATT: Yes, you can. You do. You open it up, and
there is a potion bottle within it. So you acquire

1791
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:04,788
the potion. You open the chest and you grab the
potion.

1792
01:55:04,788 --> 01:55:08,056
TRAVIS: Right, and I can't do anything else? Can I
consume it?

1793
01:55:08,056 --> 01:55:09,848
MATT: You have your bonus action, still, right?

1794
01:55:09,848 --> 01:55:12,796
TRAVIS: Yeah! That's right. Chug-a-lug, bitches.

1795
01:55:12,796 --> 01:55:14,264
MATT: So 4d4 plus four.

1796
01:55:14,264 --> 01:55:18,627
TRAVIS: Gimme some squares. No, 4d4. I need some
triangles.

1797
01:55:18,627 --> 01:55:21,619
MATT: You also take six points of fire damage,
reduced to three.

1798
01:55:21,619 --> 01:55:25,363
Because you're doing this while on fire.

1799
01:55:25,363 --> 01:55:38,746
TRAVIS: Yeah. 4d4 plus four. 14 points. That's my
turn.

1800
01:55:38,746 --> 01:55:40,772
MAT: Okay, Grog's done. Keyleth?

1801
01:55:40,772 --> 01:55:48,097
MARISHA: Okay. (grunts) Going to go ahead and drop
my fire elemental form. It's looking pretty rough

1802
01:55:48,097 --> 01:55:54,299
now. Hope I don't fuck that up. And I'm going to
peek around the corner and I can see

1803
01:55:54,299 --> 01:55:56,432
Vex a little up on the tower.

1804
01:55:56,496 --> 01:55:58,351
MATT: Make a perception check.

1805
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:02,936
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil, don't fuck me! Oh,
that's good! 29.

1806
01:56:02,936 --> 01:56:07,268
MATT: You glance up the tower, and you see just
the edge of Vex trying to hide around the

1807
01:56:07,268 --> 01:56:10,615
stonework. You see her feather and the edge of her
hair, and you see her right up on the top.

1808
01:56:10,615 --> 01:56:17,524
MARISHA: I'll be like, (yelling) your blue feather
is very pretty against the stonework!

1809
01:56:17,524 --> 01:56:19,194
LAURA: We have earrings, dear.

1810
01:56:19,194 --> 01:56:21,522
(laughter)

1811
01:56:21,522 --> 01:56:28,438
MARISHA: I yell it through the earring, and it
deafens her a little bit. (yelps) Ow, feedback.

1812
01:56:28,509 --> 01:56:33,227
LAURA: Do I hear Tary go (yelps) anywhere?

1813
01:56:33,227 --> 01:56:34,299
MATT: No.

1814
01:56:34,299 --> 01:56:39,661
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my Spire of
Conflux, and just to be sure, I'm going to call a

1815
01:56:39,661 --> 01:56:47,883
Fire Storm down and blanket the tower, and I want
to go down a little bit. So here's what I want.

1816
01:56:47,883 --> 01:56:52,425
I want this.

1817
01:56:52,425 --> 01:56:58,287
MATT: The Fire Storm down the side? How many cubes
is it?

1818
01:56:58,287 --> 01:57:01,890
MARISHA: Rain fire down everywhere.

1819
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:09,189
MATT: That's nasty. Okay, Fire Storm. Ten ten-foot
cubes.

1820
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:16,589
MARISHA: Because I don't know where Tary is. I
haven't seen him in a while.

1821
01:57:16,589 --> 01:57:21,449
MATT: You could even get to Grog, if you wanted
to.

1822
01:57:21,449 --> 01:57:23,448
MARISHA: It's a fire waterfall.

1823
01:57:23,448 --> 01:57:29,741
MATT: Yeah, it is. It's very Minecraft. (fire
noises) All right, I need you to go ahead and make

1824
01:57:29,741 --> 01:57:33,283
a dexterity saving throw, Vex. And Marisha, roll
7d10.

1825
01:57:33,283 --> 01:57:35,237
LAURA: Oh my god.

1826
01:57:35,237 --> 01:57:36,839
TRAVIS: 7d10?!

1827
01:57:36,839 --> 01:57:39,484
MATT: Yeah, that's the damage of Fire Storm, man.

1828
01:57:39,484 --> 01:57:40,796
LAURA: 20.

1829
01:57:40,796 --> 01:57:42,241
MATT: What's your DC?

1830
01:57:42,241 --> 01:57:45,018
MARISHA: Well, my spell DC is 20.

1831
01:57:45,018 --> 01:57:50,831
MATT: So you succeed, so half damage. Just barely
succeeded.

1832
01:57:50,831 --> 01:57:57,344
MARISHA: I get to reroll ones. Do you have one
more?

1833
01:57:57,344 --> 01:57:59,036
TALIESIN: Yeah, in my bag.

1834
01:57:59,036 --> 01:58:04,666
MATT: The front doors, by the way, of this tower?
Are now on fire. The wooden doors at the bottom

1835
01:58:04,666 --> 01:58:08,883
have now caught flame from the Fire Storm, and
you can see elements of the inside the tower are

1836
01:58:08,883 --> 01:58:10,660
starting to catch fire, too.

1837
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:13,809
TRAVIS: Shit, so the passage through them
would...

1838
01:58:13,809 --> 01:58:15,190
LAURA: How many? 10d10?

1839
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:16,920
MATT and MARISHA: 7d10.

1840
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:20,145
MATT: And you get to reroll ones once because of
your staff.

1841
01:58:20,145 --> 01:58:40,093
MARISHA: No ones, but it's a pretty good roll.
(counting) 26.

1842
01:58:40,093 --> 01:58:41,329
SAM: 27.

1843
01:58:41,329 --> 01:58:55,894
MARISHA: (continues counting) 52.

1844
01:58:55,894 --> 01:58:58,007
MATT: So you take 26 points of fire damage.

1845
01:58:58,007 --> 01:58:59,150
LAURA: All right.

1846
01:58:59,150 --> 01:59:00,977
MARISHA: Was Tary in there, at all?

1847
01:59:00,977 --> 01:59:01,915
MATT: No.

1848
01:59:01,915 --> 01:59:03,021
MARISHA: Fuck!

1849
01:59:03,021 --> 01:59:04,235
TRAVIS: He was?! Or he was not?

1850
01:59:04,235 --> 01:59:05,258
MATT: No.

1851
01:59:05,258 --> 01:59:06,784
SAM: I honestly have no idea.

1852
01:59:06,784 --> 01:59:09,005
TRAVIS: When you moved, you said, "I go to you
know where?"

1853
01:59:09,005 --> 01:59:11,834
SAM: No, I said, you pick me a place. I don't want
to know.

1854
01:59:11,834 --> 01:59:13,746
LAURA: He knows where, but nobody else does.

1855
01:59:13,746 --> 01:59:19,091
MATT: Based on your specifications and the movement
of the broom, yes. I know where you are.

1856
01:59:19,091 --> 01:59:26,655
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my bonus action. I
know Grog ran vaguely in this direction, so I'm

1857
01:59:26,655 --> 01:59:34,201
going to take my 30 feet of movement of my Flaming
Sphere and move it toward that tower that Grog is

1858
01:59:34,201 --> 01:59:36,588
towards. Yeah, is that 30 feet?

1859
01:59:36,588 --> 01:59:37,890
MATT: Yeah, it's 30 feet there.

1860
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:41,452
MARISHA: And then I'm going to pop back into
cover, hug against the wall.

1861
01:59:41,452 --> 01:59:45,149
MATT: All righty, that brings us to Taryon!

1862
01:59:45,149 --> 01:59:52,212
SAM: Hi. I lose Invisibility if I cast a spell.

1863
01:59:52,212 --> 01:59:53,624
MATT: Yes, or attack something.

1864
01:59:53,624 --> 01:59:56,988
SAM: Or attack something. Does drinking something
count as casting a spell?

1865
01:59:56,988 --> 01:59:57,897
MATT: Nope.

1866
01:59:57,897 --> 02:00:11,045
SAM: I will drink a Swift-Step Draught, increasing
my walking speed now to 60, plus my Boots of

1867
02:00:11,045 --> 02:00:13,414
Speed, which makes it 120.

1868
02:00:13,414 --> 02:00:14,590
MATT: Yeah.

1869
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:17,880
SAM: I'm the fastest motherfucker on the planet.

1870
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:24,325
MATT: Well, next to Vax. Not on the broom, though.
It's your walking speed.

1871
02:00:24,325 --> 02:00:37,740
SAM: No, I know. Just for future rounds, would
dropping a Smoke Stick count as an attack? It

1872
02:00:37,805 --> 02:00:41,697
doesn't hurt anyone; it just makes some smoke.

1873
02:00:41,697 --> 02:00:42,752
MATT: No.

1874
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,601
SAM: What about dropping a Tanglefoot Bag?

1875
02:00:45,601 --> 02:00:48,216
MATT: That's starting to borderline on an attack.

1876
02:00:48,216 --> 02:00:52,644
SAM: Okay! I just want to know my options here.
All right, cool. I think that's it.

1877
02:00:52,644 --> 02:00:55,625
MATT: You're not too sure. You can try it.

1878
02:00:55,625 --> 02:01:01,425
SAM: The speed thing. And oh, can you just tell
me, without telling me where I am, do I know the

1879
02:01:01,425 --> 02:01:03,761
location of Keyleth?

1880
02:01:03,761 --> 02:01:04,847
MATT: Yes.

1881
02:01:04,847 --> 02:01:07,852
SAM: Okay. And do I know the location of
everybody?

1882
02:01:07,907 --> 02:01:14,881
MATT: Yes. You watched Grog run past, you watched
Vex get set fire in a tower, and you watched

1883
02:01:14,881 --> 02:01:17,268
Keyleth cast the spell and then disappear inside
the room.

1884
02:01:17,268 --> 02:01:18,230
SAM: Okay.

1885
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:19,394
TALIESIN: Is Vex on fire again?

1886
02:01:19,394 --> 02:01:24,794
MATT: She's not caught fire, but you watched
flames consume her briefly. (laughs) It seems to

1887
02:01:24,794 --> 02:01:25,806
be a theme.

1888
02:01:25,806 --> 02:01:27,013
SAM: All right, just move me around.

1889
02:01:27,013 --> 02:01:36,523
MATT: Okay. That's your turn, Taryon. All right,
top of the round. The arcane towers burst. I need

1890
02:01:36,523 --> 02:01:38,068
you to make a dexterity saving throw.

1891
02:01:38,068 --> 02:01:45,259
LAURA: Motherfuck. Oh, that's great; that
definitely saves. 30.

1892
02:01:45,259 --> 02:01:51,395
MATT: 30? Okay, that would be 11 points of
lightning damage, reduced to five.

1893
02:01:51,395 --> 02:01:52,525
LAURA: Okay.

1894
02:01:52,525 --> 02:02:00,170
MATT: All right. Vex, your turn. As the flames
subside, you're like (pants). You glance over and

1895
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:02,892
you can see Keyleth vanish back inside that room.

1896
02:02:02,892 --> 02:02:05,617
LAURA: (groans) But I can't see her? I can't see
anybody from where I am?

1897
02:02:05,617 --> 02:02:09,889
MATT: Currently, you have no view of her, but you
just watched her just barely step inside. You can

1898
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:13,608
still get perspective if you were to move to get a
better angle.

1899
02:02:13,608 --> 02:02:16,294
TALIESIN: This board was designed to actually fuck
with the two of us, because we don't have any good

1900
02:02:16,294 --> 02:02:18,563
long-distance shots but they have nothing but
cover.

1901
02:02:18,563 --> 02:02:20,627
LAURA: There's nowhere for us to hide!

1902
02:02:20,627 --> 02:02:28,470
MATT: There's plenty of places for you guys to
hide. There's nothing but hiding places!

1903
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:42,042
LAURA: No, I know. It's ground hiding. I'm going
to fly up towards you, Matthew.

1904
02:02:42,042 --> 02:02:44,004
MATT: Okay, over here?

1905
02:02:44,004 --> 02:02:45,128
LAURA: Yes.

1906
02:02:45,128 --> 02:02:45,954
MATT: Okay.

1907
02:02:45,954 --> 02:02:48,249
LAURA: And I'm going to hover right there. Wait,
can I see Keyleth?

1908
02:02:48,249 --> 02:02:50,073
MATT: You can barely see Keyleth out of the side,
yeah.

1909
02:02:50,073 --> 02:02:52,296
LAURA: Okay, but three-quarters, and I can still
attack her?

1910
02:02:52,296 --> 02:02:55,322
MATT: Yes, because you have sharpshooter, so you
can attack her.

1911
02:02:55,322 --> 02:02:58,170
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to attack her. She's in
that building.

1912
02:02:58,170 --> 02:03:07,282
MATT: You get to about there. You can look down
and you see her poking out.

1913
02:03:07,282 --> 02:03:10,586
LAURA: I want to be low enough that at the end of
my movement I can drop down to the ground.

1914
02:03:10,586 --> 02:03:12,158
MATT: Okay, I see.

1915
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:15,817
LAURA: I mean, drop down to the roof. Yeah.

1916
02:03:15,817 --> 02:03:22,409
MATT: Yeah, so we'll say you can be there. You can
get down to the roof and see her from there.

1917
02:03:22,409 --> 02:03:28,815
LAURA: (laughing) Yeah. That works, too! She's
still Hunter's Marked from before, isn't she?

1918
02:03:28,815 --> 02:03:31,457
MARISHA: Did you ever Hunter's Mark me?

1919
02:03:31,457 --> 02:03:33,734
MATT: You Hunter's Marked Grog, I thought.

1920
02:03:33,734 --> 02:03:35,515
LAURA: I Hunter's Marked Percy.

1921
02:03:35,515 --> 02:03:37,201
MATT: Percy. That's what it was. Yeah.

1922
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:39,527
LAURA: Then I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to
Keyleth.

1923
02:03:39,527 --> 02:03:41,112
MATT: Keyleth as a bonus action.

1924
02:03:41,112 --> 02:03:46,621
LAURA: Oh, wait. That's a bonus action, just to
move it?

1925
02:03:46,621 --> 02:03:47,567
MATT: Yeah.

1926
02:03:47,567 --> 02:03:49,200
LAURA: Okay, then never mind. I'm not going to do
that.

1927
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:50,522
MATT: I'm pretty sure it is.

1928
02:03:50,522 --> 02:03:52,671
LAURA: It probably is; I'm not going to do it.

1929
02:03:52,671 --> 02:03:53,734
MATT: Okay.

1930
02:03:53,734 --> 02:03:55,141
LAURA: 26 to hit.

1931
02:03:55,141 --> 02:03:56,413
MATT: 26 hits.

1932
02:03:56,413 --> 02:03:57,625
LAURA: Okay.

1933
02:03:57,625 --> 02:03:58,973
MATT: So you're not Hunter's Marking her?

1934
02:03:58,973 --> 02:03:59,990
LAURA: No.

1935
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:01,150
MATT: Okay.

1936
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:12,891
LAURA: 16, plus five lightning damage. And I'm
going to hit her again.

1937
02:04:12,891 --> 02:04:21,612
MATT: 16 plus nine. Roll a concentration check.
With advantage.

1938
02:04:21,612 --> 02:04:24,718
MARISHA: Oh yeah. I'm good. I rolled a natural
19.

1939
02:04:24,718 --> 02:04:25,850
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

1940
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:27,519
LAURA: And the second attack is 30.

1941
02:04:27,519 --> 02:04:33,300
MATT: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1942
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:35,933
LAURA: 16 plus four lightning damage.

1943
02:04:35,933 --> 02:04:41,627
MATT: That's 20 points of damage. Go ahead and
roll another concentration check. Just roll higher

1944
02:04:41,627 --> 02:04:42,954
than a ten.

1945
02:04:42,954 --> 02:04:48,204
MARISHA: With my modifier, right? With my bonus?

1946
02:04:48,204 --> 02:04:49,924
MATT: Yeah, whatever your constitution saving
throw is.

1947
02:04:49,924 --> 02:04:51,298
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.

1948
02:04:51,298 --> 02:04:52,405
MATT: So maintains concentration.

1949
02:04:52,405 --> 02:05:03,636
LAURA: And then for my bonus action, I'm going to cast--
oh, wait, can I do that? No, it's not. Shitballs.

1950
02:05:03,636 --> 02:05:09,403
I was thinking I had a potion, but I don't, and I
can't cast a Cure Wounds. That's an action. And I

1951
02:05:09,403 --> 02:05:18,073
can't retrograde a Hex on her. So I'm going to try
to hide again, because that's the only bonus I can

1952
02:05:18,073 --> 02:05:19,388
do right now.

1953
02:05:19,388 --> 02:05:21,899
MATT: You don't really have any way to hide from
her right now.

1954
02:05:21,899 --> 02:05:24,007
LAURA: I'm going to drop down to the ground.

1955
02:05:24,007 --> 02:05:25,520
MATT: Okay, so you drop prone.

1956
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,206
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's an angle you can hold.

1957
02:05:27,206 --> 02:05:29,573
MATT: There you go, we'll say.

1958
02:05:29,573 --> 02:05:32,775
LAURA: I don't have any movement. I used all my
movement just to get there.

1959
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:33,877
MATT: Yep.

1960
02:05:33,877 --> 02:05:39,532
LAURA: Tight. Because there's no such thing as
Fire Storm, which just fucking destroyed me. No

1961
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:41,030
such thing.

1962
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:43,059
MARISHA: Nope. Don't have any more of those.

1963
02:05:43,059 --> 02:05:47,948
LAURA: Maybe I'll roll a natural 20 and then
she'll just not know that I dropped down. I rolled

1964
02:05:47,948 --> 02:05:49,206
a natural 20!

1965
02:05:49,206 --> 02:05:51,173
TRAVIS: Fucking right, she did.

1966
02:05:51,173 --> 02:05:53,816
LAURA: Does it matter at all that I rolled a
natural 20?

1967
02:05:53,816 --> 02:06:00,452
MATT: You watched her vanish. You know she's
somewhere on or near that roof, but you're not

1968
02:06:00,452 --> 02:06:10,297
specifically aware. So that ends your turn. Grog?

1969
02:06:10,297 --> 02:06:26,803
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can I step out of the room? Can I
use as my bonus action my Boots of Feral Leaping

1970
02:06:26,803 --> 02:06:32,396
to jump 20 feet horizontally towards the building
that Vex is on? Straight line towards the door.

1971
02:06:32,396 --> 02:06:33,808
Straight up.

1972
02:06:33,808 --> 02:06:36,308
MATT: Roll for that.

1973
02:06:36,308 --> 02:06:41,312
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

1974
02:06:41,312 --> 02:06:49,999
MATT: 22, yep. You actually land on Doty's head,
crushing it into the ground.

1975
02:06:49,999 --> 02:06:57,140
TRAVIS: Can I use the remainder of my 50 feet of
speed to run into the building that Vex is in?

1976
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:59,758
TALIESIN: He is being so smart.

1977
02:06:59,758 --> 02:07:05,239
MATT: That's the rest of your movement, there.

1978
02:07:05,239 --> 02:07:06,672
TRAVIS: Right there?

1979
02:07:06,672 --> 02:07:11,867
MATT: Yeah. You can dash if you want to move all
the way in, but you won't have an action.

1980
02:07:11,867 --> 02:07:15,407
SAM: You can still touch the building.

1981
02:07:15,407 --> 02:07:26,671
TRAVIS: Damn, I thought that was going to be just
enough. I am going to dash inside.

1982
02:07:26,671 --> 02:07:32,770
MATT: Okay. So you head inside, and you get to the
appearance of this.

1983
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:35,571
SAM: You're too big for the ceiling.

1984
02:07:35,571 --> 02:07:40,014
MATT: You get in there, and there is the chest
there, yeah.

1985
02:07:40,014 --> 02:07:42,722
TRAVIS: Great. That is my movement.

1986
02:07:42,722 --> 02:07:44,158
MATT: That's your turn?

1987
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:45,105
TRAVIS: Yes.

1988
02:07:45,105 --> 02:07:47,557
SAM: Did you drink the potion that you found? What
was it?

1989
02:07:47,557 --> 02:07:49,501
TRAVIS: It was a greater.

1990
02:07:49,501 --> 02:07:50,467
SAM: Oh, cool.

1991
02:07:50,467 --> 02:07:52,178
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth?

1992
02:07:52,178 --> 02:07:56,356
MARISHA: Oh god. I don't know what to do.

1993
02:07:56,356 --> 02:08:01,388
MATT: Yeah, you just got shot twice, and you're
(gasps). You pull back inside and you're (gasps).

1994
02:08:01,388 --> 02:08:06,294
You glance outside and you hear (heavy footfalls).
You have no idea where Vex is at the moment. The

1995
02:08:06,294 --> 02:08:10,404
last you saw her, she was on the roof, and you
watched Grog dart by without seeing you and then

1996
02:08:10,404 --> 02:08:12,223
run into the building right across the way.

1997
02:08:12,223 --> 02:08:18,800
MARISHA: Okay. All right. Fucking hell.

1998
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:21,826
TALIESIN: I know. It's a horrifying piece of
paper.

1999
02:08:21,826 --> 02:08:23,801
LAURA: I have to pee so bad.

2000
02:08:23,801 --> 02:08:25,095
TRAVIS: Go now.

2001
02:08:25,095 --> 02:08:26,628
LAURA: No, what if I die?

2002
02:08:26,628 --> 02:08:28,676
MATT: What are you going to do, Keyleth?

2003
02:08:28,676 --> 02:08:35,422
MARISHA: Okay. Fuck. Fuck! What am I going to do?

2004
02:08:35,422 --> 02:08:38,835
MATT: What are you going to do?

2005
02:08:38,835 --> 02:08:43,455
TALIESIN: Do something crazy.

2006
02:08:43,455 --> 02:08:54,985
MARISHA: If I do a Fire Storm around there, can I
also call on the inside of the room, as well?

2007
02:08:54,985 --> 02:08:59,355
MATT: Yeah. It's just making them adjacent to each
other. That can be in height, too, yeah. As long

2008
02:08:59,355 --> 02:09:01,645
as they're against a surface.

2009
02:09:01,645 --> 02:09:06,295
MARISHA: Yeah, fuck it. Let's do that again. Pop
out once again from the spire,

2010
02:09:06,295 --> 02:09:09,023
(war cry) coming down.

2011
02:09:09,023 --> 02:09:12,111
MATT: Okay. So how many points has that spent on
the spire?

2012
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:16,954
MARISHA: I only did it once, so that's seven, so
that brings me to another seven, so I have six

2013
02:09:16,954 --> 02:09:18,679
points left in the spire.

2014
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:27,202
MATT: There you go. You're causing it to consume
the entire roof?

2015
02:09:27,202 --> 02:09:32,923
MARISHA: Yeah. And because I heard Grog run in
that area, too.

2016
02:09:32,923 --> 02:09:36,345
MATT: Yeah, so you can just fill the roof and then
down the side and then fill the inside.

2017
02:09:36,345 --> 02:09:38,451
MARISHA: I'm just lighting up that tower.

2018
02:09:38,451 --> 02:09:40,978
MATT: All right, so I need both Grog and Vex to
make dexterity saving throws.

2019
02:09:41,208 --> 02:09:47,062
TRAVIS: That might be all she wrote. We'll find
out. I have advantage on these. That's not

2020
02:09:47,062 --> 02:09:48,880
awesome. That's better.

2021
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:50,786
LAURA: 25.

2022
02:09:50,786 --> 02:09:51,927
TRAVIS: 19?

2023
02:09:51,927 --> 02:09:58,202
MATT: 19 does not make it. So roll 7d10 fire
damage. You take half of it because you're

2024
02:09:58,202 --> 02:09:59,302
resistant.

2025
02:09:59,302 --> 02:10:01,584
LAURA: Well, that's good.

2026
02:10:01,584 --> 02:10:07,797
TRAVIS: I've also been hit a lot. I don't like
getting that close.

2027
02:10:07,797 --> 02:10:10,364
SAM: What just fell all over the floor?

2028
02:10:10,364 --> 02:10:19,873
MARISHA: That was one of my dice. I re-roll ones.
Okay.

2029
02:10:19,873 --> 02:10:21,843
LAURA: What did you just do?

2030
02:10:21,843 --> 02:10:23,272
TRAVIS: Acted like I pushed you off.

2031
02:10:23,272 --> 02:10:39,657
MARISHA: I rolled two tens, so that's 20. Two
eights, so that's 36. 41. 44. One, two, three,

2032
02:10:39,657 --> 02:10:50,313
four, five, six, 44 plus seven is 51. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven. 7d10.

2033
02:10:50,313 --> 02:10:54,687
MATT: Yep. 51 points of fire damage to you Grog,
halve that to 25.

2034
02:10:54,687 --> 02:10:56,095
TRAVIS: 25.

2035
02:10:56,095 --> 02:10:57,334
MATT: Still conscious?

2036
02:10:57,334 --> 02:10:58,237
TRAVIS: Yes.

2037
02:10:58,237 --> 02:11:01,437
MATT: Good. Vex, you take the same thing. 25
points of fire damage.

2038
02:11:01,437 --> 02:11:03,277
LAURA: Okay.

2039
02:11:03,277 --> 02:11:07,356
MATT: So that's your attack.

2040
02:11:07,356 --> 02:11:13,098
MARISHA: For my bonus action, I want to bring my
Flaming Sphill to block this doorway that I'm in

2041
02:11:13,098 --> 02:11:14,068
front of.

2042
02:11:14,068 --> 02:11:15,246
MATT: The Flaming Sphere?

2043
02:11:15,246 --> 02:11:16,082
MARISHA: Yep.

2044
02:11:16,082 --> 02:11:20,082
LAURA: Sphill. The Flaming Sphill is what she
said, and that is what it forever will be called.

2045
02:11:20,082 --> 02:11:22,862
MATT: The Flaming Sphere hits there.

2046
02:11:22,862 --> 02:11:36,836
MARISHA: Okay, and then I want to move back and...
fuck. Around here, on the outside, and hide. Did

2047
02:11:36,836 --> 02:11:41,038
you get where I said?

2048
02:11:41,038 --> 02:11:45,300
MATT: Yeah, you're right. So yes.

2049
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:51,537
MARISHA: I want to go on this side of the building
to use for cover.

2050
02:11:51,537 --> 02:11:54,184
MATT: So you get there.

2051
02:11:54,184 --> 02:11:58,979
MARISHA: Perfect. And then I don't have anything
else I can do, do I?

2052
02:11:58,979 --> 02:12:00,539
SAM: Well, you did everything.

2053
02:12:00,539 --> 02:12:02,948
MARISHA: That's it.

2054
02:12:02,948 --> 02:12:05,145
LAURA: Oh, I only called a giant Fire Storm!

2055
02:12:05,145 --> 02:12:07,088
MARISHA: Can I also hide?

2056
02:12:07,088 --> 02:12:11,077
MATT: No, you spent all your actions. They're well
aware of where you are; they watched you

2057
02:12:11,077 --> 02:12:16,801
(footsteps) around the corner. You hear (heavy
breathing) around the wall.

2058
02:12:16,801 --> 02:12:19,035
MARISHA: Fuck, I hope that wasn't a mistake.

2059
02:12:19,035 --> 02:12:21,056
MATT: That finishes Keyleth's turn. Taryon.

2060
02:12:21,056 --> 02:12:28,104
SAM: I assume, because you know me, Matt, and
you're a skilled strategery man, that I am

2061
02:12:28,104 --> 02:12:29,641
somewhere near Doty?

2062
02:12:29,641 --> 02:12:35,747
MATT: You could, with your movement, reach him.

2063
02:12:35,747 --> 02:12:46,751
SAM: I'll hover near him, over him-- but not right
over him, everybody! And just chuck that Smoke

2064
02:12:46,751 --> 02:12:48,674
Stick right on him.

2065
02:12:48,674 --> 02:12:53,727
MATT: Okay. (hissing gas) What's the radius of
that?

2066
02:12:53,727 --> 02:12:56,234
SAM: It's only a ten-foot radius.

2067
02:12:56,234 --> 02:13:03,194
MATT: Yeah, so there's a 20-foot area here.
Keyleth's the only one that can see it out of the

2068
02:13:03,194 --> 02:13:10,792
corner of your eye. You watch as where Doty's body
is, suddenly smoke fills this area here, obscuring

2069
02:13:10,792 --> 02:13:15,434
Doty's currently not moving body. That's your
turn?

2070
02:13:15,434 --> 02:13:16,895
SAM: That's it.

2071
02:13:16,895 --> 02:13:18,748
TRAVIS: So wait, where did you go?

2072
02:13:18,748 --> 02:13:26,816
SAM: I don't know, actually. I'm in the air,
somewhere within a 30-foot circle of Doty.

2073
02:13:26,816 --> 02:13:27,997
TRAVIS: Okay.

2074
02:13:27,997 --> 02:13:31,859
MATT: If this is going to continue, I want you to
tell me where you're going, just to come over and

2075
02:13:31,859 --> 02:13:35,191
whisper to me. Otherwise this is getting a little
weird. For the first round, it's fine, but...

2076
02:13:35,191 --> 02:13:36,666
TALIESIN: Start texting.

2077
02:13:36,666 --> 02:13:42,135
MATT: Yeah, you can text me if you want to, or
come by and whisper real fast. All right. That

2078
02:13:42,135 --> 02:13:44,720
brings us to top of the round...

2079
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:46,560
MARISHA: Is anyone still on fire, like Grog?

2080
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,832
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am.

2081
02:13:47,832 --> 02:13:49,090
MARISHA: Another ten.

2082
02:13:49,090 --> 02:14:00,836
MATT: You did take ten damage, reduced to five.
All righty. So the towers (vibration) begin to

2083
02:14:00,836 --> 02:14:05,925
extend that vibration again, and the gravity
begins to converge and condense around each of

2084
02:14:05,925 --> 02:14:16,280
these towers once more. All righty. Vex, you're
up. You're on your back right now, going (groans).

2085
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:19,238
A little bit of smoke (coughs) out of the mouth.

2086
02:14:19,238 --> 02:14:26,028
LAURA: If I flew up to the top of the tower,
nobody would see me that I know, right?

2087
02:14:26,028 --> 02:14:27,250
Right now?

2088
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:28,672
MATT: That you know of.

2089
02:14:28,672 --> 02:14:36,950
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to fly up to the top
of the tower by me. But I'm going to be at the

2090
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:40,389
back. I'm going to step away from the edge so that
people on the ground can't see me.

2091
02:14:40,389 --> 02:14:41,939
MATT: Okay, about there.

2092
02:14:41,939 --> 02:14:43,095
LAURA: Yeah.

2093
02:14:43,095 --> 02:14:44,725
MATT: That's as far as you can get with your full
movement.

2094
02:14:44,725 --> 02:14:54,407
LAURA: Okay, and I'm going to use my action to
cast Cure Wounds at 3rd level.

2095
02:14:54,407 --> 02:14:55,932
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2096
02:14:55,932 --> 02:15:15,801
LAURA: Which is 3d8. 15, plus my spellcasting
modifier, which is 18 points. So I heal 18 points

2097
02:15:15,801 --> 02:15:19,938
of health.

2098
02:15:19,938 --> 02:15:22,620
MATT: 18 points of health to you. All right, got
it.

2099
02:15:22,744 --> 02:15:27,128
LAURA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action.

2100
02:15:27,128 --> 02:15:33,446
MATT: Trinket's still doing okay. Succeeded two.

2101
02:15:33,446 --> 02:15:42,632
LAURA: Oh, okay. I can't go down there. Before I
moved, can I have cast Hunter's Mark on Keyleth,

2102
02:15:42,632 --> 02:15:44,236
for my bonus?

2103
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:46,668
MATT: You didn't have visual on her at that time.

2104
02:15:46,668 --> 02:15:49,658
LAURA: I still don't have visual? Do I have visual
on her now?

2105
02:15:49,658 --> 02:15:53,686
MATT: Not since you moved away from the edge. You
moved out of the way to make sure

2106
02:15:53,686 --> 02:15:54,859
nobody could see you.

2107
02:15:54,859 --> 02:15:59,259
LAURA: Can I say I moved up, cast Hunter's Mark on
her, and then backed off?

2108
02:15:59,259 --> 02:16:02,834
MATT: Sure, yeah. She wasn't hidden. So she's
marked.

2109
02:16:02,834 --> 02:16:04,889
LAURA: Okay, and that's it.

2110
02:16:04,889 --> 02:16:08,265
MATT: Okay, that's the end of your turn. Grog?

2111
02:16:08,265 --> 02:16:13,160
TRAVIS: All right. Can I use my bonus action to
take the healing potion in that room?

2112
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:18,441
MATT: You haven't opened the chest yet. So your
action (bang) open the chest. Grab the potion,

2113
02:16:18,441 --> 02:16:19,949
bonus action to drink it, yeah.

2114
02:16:19,949 --> 02:16:21,033
TRAVIS: 4d4?

2115
02:16:21,033 --> 02:16:22,013
MATT: 4d4 plus four.

2116
02:16:22,013 --> 02:16:24,128
LAURA: The chest wasn't on fire and the potion
wasn't destroyed?

2117
02:16:24,128 --> 02:16:29,063
MATT: The chest is burning, but you're already on
fire, so it doesn't affect you any more than it

2118
02:16:29,063 --> 02:16:33,360
would. But you do take two points of fire damage.
It was four, reduced to two,

2119
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,837
because you're still burning.

2120
02:16:34,837 --> 02:16:36,516
LAURA: (laughing) You're still burning.

2121
02:16:36,516 --> 02:16:40,730
SAM: He's not wasting any actions to put himself
out?

2122
02:16:40,730 --> 02:16:42,763
LAURA: No. I love it.

2123
02:16:42,763 --> 02:16:44,187
MATT: It's very Grog.

2124
02:16:44,187 --> 02:16:45,806
TRAVIS: 15.

2125
02:16:45,806 --> 02:16:47,595
MARISHA: I know, I look fucking crazy.

2126
02:16:47,595 --> 02:16:50,294
MATT: You were Hunter's Marked, by the way,
Keyleth.

2127
02:16:50,294 --> 02:16:52,373
MARISHA: Fuck! Did I get hit?

2128
02:16:52,373 --> 02:16:53,742
MATT: No, just Hunter's Marked.

2129
02:16:53,742 --> 02:17:06,772
TRAVIS: Okay. And can I use my movement... to go
to this corner behind the wall?

2130
02:17:06,772 --> 02:17:08,638
MATT: Yeah.

2131
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:11,598
LAURA: He is loving that fire.

2132
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:15,589
SAM: Oh shit! Does he see an empty ball sitting
there?

2133
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:16,889
MATT: Yep!

2134
02:17:16,889 --> 02:17:18,650
SAM; The jig is up!

2135
02:17:18,650 --> 02:17:22,688
MATT: You run over and you see a giant, empty
hamster ball with a big window carved in it that's

2136
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:24,492
empty and derelict.

2137
02:17:24,492 --> 02:17:30,649
TRAVIS: Empty?! That's my turn.

2138
02:17:30,649 --> 02:17:32,446
MATT: All righty. Keyleth.

2139
02:17:32,446 --> 02:17:38,952
MARISHA: Okay. Oh my god. This is so scary.

2140
02:17:38,952 --> 02:17:40,354
TALIESIN: You have that thing you can do.

2141
02:17:40,354 --> 02:17:41,596
MARISHA: I do have that thing I can do.

2142
02:17:41,596 --> 02:17:43,393
SAM: Oh, the Kill Everyone spell?

2143
02:17:43,393 --> 02:17:48,044
MARISHA: Yeah, that Kill Everyone spell... It's
time.

2144
02:17:48,044 --> 02:17:49,411
SAM: Oh god.

2145
02:17:49,411 --> 02:17:50,483
MARISHA: It's time.

2146
02:17:50,483 --> 02:17:52,855
TALIESIN: It's time. Yeah! I've been waiting for
it.

2147
02:17:52,855 --> 02:18:01,742
MARISHA: I am going to, thinking of the acidy
black pit in front of us, and remembering

2148
02:18:01,742 --> 02:18:13,454
Umbrasyl, I am going to turn into an adult black
dragon. (war cry) Full werewolf transformation.

2149
02:18:13,454 --> 02:18:15,190
TRAVIS: Are you serious right now?

2150
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:19,202
MATT: So I don't have an adult black dragon mini.
We're going to use a red one,

2151
02:18:19,202 --> 02:18:20,905
but you are a black one.

2152
02:18:20,905 --> 02:18:24,851
MARISHA: And I burn my Shapechange.

2153
02:18:24,851 --> 02:18:27,203
MATT: Yeah. You are still Hunter's Marked, but
yeah.

2154
02:18:27,203 --> 02:18:29,821
MARISHA: I hope I don't die.

2155
02:18:29,821 --> 02:18:33,962
SAM: No, we got this. We got this.

2156
02:18:33,962 --> 02:18:36,272
TRAVIS: Do some shit!

2157
02:18:36,272 --> 02:18:38,938
SAM: I don't exist.

2158
02:18:38,938 --> 02:18:43,659
LAURA: Seriously! Just a bystander, this whole
fight.

2159
02:18:43,659 --> 02:18:45,962
MARISHA: I can move, right?

2160
02:18:45,962 --> 02:18:47,901
MATT: Yeah, you can still move.

2161
02:18:47,901 --> 02:18:52,027
MARISHA: So how deep is this watery pit? Does it
go pretty deep?

2162
02:18:52,027 --> 02:18:53,937
MATT: Only one way to find out.

2163
02:18:53,937 --> 02:19:01,774
MARISHA: I am going to, as a dragon, see how far I
can get. I'm going to go black dragon, who can

2164
02:19:01,774 --> 02:19:07,734
swim and is immune to acid. I'm going to go (heavy
footsteps) and see if I can lay underneath the

2165
02:19:07,734 --> 02:19:09,585
surface of the acid.

2166
02:19:09,585 --> 02:19:14,313
MATT: You delve into the pool with a splash as it
spills over the edges, and you submerge yourself

2167
02:19:14,313 --> 02:19:18,603
beneath the surface. It's just deep enough for you
to get entirely within the water.

2168
02:19:18,603 --> 02:19:22,151
LAURA: But all the acid pours up and out, doesn't
it? Displacement.

2169
02:19:22,151 --> 02:19:26,725
MATT: It displaces a bit, yeah. But while she's in
it, she's currently submerged.

2170
02:19:26,725 --> 02:19:28,037
TRAVIS: She's not hurt from it?

2171
02:19:28,037 --> 02:19:33,312
LAURA: Does Trinket get hit by the acid? But Doty
does, too.

2172
02:19:33,312 --> 02:19:37,004
MATT: Yep, both of them begin to just (sizzle).
Doty's done.

2173
02:19:37,004 --> 02:19:39,584
LAURA: Right. But just in case.

2174
02:19:39,584 --> 02:19:41,680
SAM: Oh. I thought he was immune, but he's not.

2175
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:47,789
MATT: Nope. And Trinket begins to slowly dissolve
in his unconscious state. That is a second failed

2176
02:19:47,789 --> 02:19:49,466
death save on Trinket.

2177
02:19:49,466 --> 02:19:50,815
SAM: Doty's done?

2178
02:19:50,815 --> 02:19:52,626
MATT: Well, yeah.

2179
02:19:52,626 --> 02:19:54,796
LAURA: Keyleth doesn't care about animals,
apparently.

2180
02:19:54,796 --> 02:19:56,149
MARISHA: Nope.

2181
02:19:56,149 --> 02:19:57,544
LAURA: Only plants.

2182
02:19:57,544 --> 02:19:59,335
MARISHA: That's true. A little biased.

2183
02:19:59,335 --> 02:20:04,131
TRAVIS: At least finish him with dignity before
you go into the pool. You just passed right by

2184
02:20:04,131 --> 02:20:06,709
him. Just let him suffer, unconscious.

2185
02:20:06,709 --> 02:20:11,784
MARISHA: I mean, I could accidentally trip over
him and kick him into the pool with me, if you

2186
02:20:11,784 --> 02:20:13,080
really want me to.

2187
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:14,961
MATT: Is that your turn, Keyleth?

2188
02:20:14,961 --> 02:20:15,794
MARISHA: That's it.

2189
02:20:15,794 --> 02:20:16,974
MATT: All right. Taryon.

2190
02:20:16,974 --> 02:20:18,380
SAM: Land in the smoke.

2191
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:19,475
MATT: All right.

2192
02:20:19,475 --> 02:20:22,484
SAM: See that Doty is history.

2193
02:20:22,484 --> 02:20:23,477
MATT: Yes.

2194
02:20:23,477 --> 02:20:26,077
SAM: Fire Prismatic Spray at the dragon.

2195
02:20:26,077 --> 02:20:28,322
MATT: Okay.

2196
02:20:28,322 --> 02:20:29,580
MARISHA: You can't see me.

2197
02:20:29,580 --> 02:20:39,348
MATT: You're submerged in the water, but the spray
goes through water. It's a light effect. So you

2198
02:20:39,348 --> 02:20:44,522
grab one of your rubies, you run up to the edge of
the smoke, and release a Prismatic Spray in this

2199
02:20:44,522 --> 02:20:55,257
direction. Trinket's done. Trinket is turned to
dust and ash. We're talking Terminator 2 dream

2200
02:20:55,257 --> 02:20:56,735
sequence atomic bomb.

2201
02:20:56,735 --> 02:20:58,098
TRAVIS: It's all T2 tonight!

2202
02:20:58,098 --> 02:21:03,174
MARISHA: Question. Sorry, before we move too far.
Are people affected by my frightful presence

2203
02:21:03,174 --> 02:21:10,456
within 120 feet? Those who are aware of me once I
(heavy footsteps) and then go in.

2204
02:21:10,456 --> 02:21:12,426
MATT: That's an interesting point, actually.

2205
02:21:12,426 --> 02:21:16,865
MARISHA: 120 feet, wisdom saving throw.

2206
02:21:16,865 --> 02:21:22,477
MATT: Well, the only one who's seen you transform
is Taryon, so Taryon, I need you to go ahead and

2207
02:21:22,477 --> 02:21:26,186
make a wisdom saving throw, please.

2208
02:21:26,186 --> 02:21:36,233
SAM: Oh, that's not high for me. No, that's
terrible for me. Oh. I'm going to use Luck! I'm

2209
02:21:36,233 --> 02:21:37,977
going to use Luck.

2210
02:21:37,977 --> 02:21:40,531
TALIESIN: (cackles)

2211
02:21:40,531 --> 02:21:42,162
TRAVIS: They're both terrible?

2212
02:21:42,162 --> 02:21:43,525
SAM: One and a two.

2213
02:21:43,525 --> 02:21:49,927
TALIESIN: A two and a one, even better. He rolled
a two. He rolled again and rolled a one.

2214
02:21:49,927 --> 02:21:54,076
MATT: You are considered frightened. You watch as
Keyleth turns into this black dragon and you go

2215
02:21:54,076 --> 02:21:57,669
(screams) and watch her dive into the acid pool
and you go (screams).

2216
02:21:57,669 --> 02:22:01,224
SAM: So when I'm frightened, I just want to get
away, right?

2217
02:22:01,224 --> 02:22:04,869
MATT: Well, no. When you're frightened,
specifically, you have disadvantage on ability

2218
02:22:04,869 --> 02:22:09,821
checks and attack rolls, as long as you can see
them, and you cannot move willingly closer to it.

2219
02:22:09,821 --> 02:22:17,535
You can move away or adjacent, but you cannot move
closer to her. You make the saving throw at the

2220
02:22:17,535 --> 02:22:18,736
end of your turn.

2221
02:22:18,736 --> 02:22:20,184
SAM: I was not planning on it, anyway.

2222
02:22:20,184 --> 02:22:22,119
TALIESIN: But it does mean that you have
disadvantage on the attack.

2223
02:22:22,119 --> 02:22:23,315
SAM: But it's a spell.

2224
02:22:23,315 --> 02:22:25,867
MATT: It's a spell. It doesn't affect him at all.
So you still have to make a saving throw versus

2225
02:22:25,867 --> 02:22:27,169
Prismatic Spray.

2226
02:22:27,169 --> 02:22:29,360
MARISHA: Shit. What kind of a saving throw?

2227
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:30,739
MATT: We'll find out here in a second.

2228
02:22:30,739 --> 02:22:35,674
TALIESIN: It could be anything. It could be
something you're downright immune to.

2229
02:22:35,674 --> 02:22:37,628
MARISHA: That's true. Come on, acid!

2230
02:22:37,628 --> 02:22:39,415
MATT: So I need you to roll a d8, please.

2231
02:22:39,415 --> 02:22:44,613
SAM: d8. Four.

2232
02:22:44,613 --> 02:22:52,878
MATT: Four. I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw as an adult black dragon.

2233
02:22:52,878 --> 02:22:54,512
SAM: They're probably pretty dexterous.

2234
02:22:54,512 --> 02:22:56,645
MARISHA: Well, they're big fatty dragons.

2235
02:22:56,645 --> 02:22:58,795
TRAVIS: Wow, that is really stereotypical.

2236
02:22:58,795 --> 02:23:04,133
MARISHA: Not great. Seven.

2237
02:23:04,133 --> 02:23:07,739
MATT: Nope. So you take 10d6 poison damage.

2238
02:23:07,739 --> 02:23:10,463
SAM: Poison! Poison for the win!

2239
02:23:10,463 --> 02:23:12,859
MARISHA: Poison.

2240
02:23:12,859 --> 02:23:18,725
SAM: I don't want to roll 10d6, so I'm going to
use one of those websites.

2241
02:23:18,725 --> 02:23:23,277
TALIESIN: Here's 10d6. One, two, three...

2242
02:23:23,277 --> 02:23:25,322
SAM: Then I have to do all the math.

2243
02:23:25,322 --> 02:23:28,534
TALIESIN: Here's ten. Here's ten right here.

2244
02:23:28,534 --> 02:23:30,091
TRAVIS: We've got calculators out, ready to help.

2245
02:23:30,091 --> 02:23:31,427
MATT: You earned this.

2246
02:23:31,427 --> 02:23:40,921
TALIESIN: All the ones that are not yours. Oh man.
Oh, that's bad.

2247
02:23:40,921 --> 02:23:43,040
SAM: 34. That's not that bad.

2248
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:44,199
MARISHA: 34?

2249
02:23:44,199 --> 02:23:47,487
MATT: 34 points of poison damage to you. Make a
constitution saving throw.

2250
02:23:47,487 --> 02:23:50,764
TRAVIS: How many hit points does an adult dragon
have?

2251
02:23:50,764 --> 02:23:51,791
MARISHA: A lot.

2252
02:23:51,791 --> 02:23:53,603
TRAVIS: Like, triple digits?

2253
02:23:53,603 --> 02:23:55,927
MARISHA: Oh, that's a natural 19.

2254
02:23:55,927 --> 02:23:58,048
MATT: You rolled twice, though, didn't you?

2255
02:23:58,048 --> 02:23:59,238
MARISHA: I have advantage.

2256
02:23:59,238 --> 02:24:04,652
MATT: Oh, that's right, because you have that
feat. She has the Warcaster feat. So you're good.

2257
02:24:04,652 --> 02:24:06,753
TRAVIS: Why are we even in this fight?

2258
02:24:06,753 --> 02:24:13,043
SAM: I'm no longer invisible. But I am in a
protecty cloud.

2259
02:24:13,043 --> 02:24:20,181
MATT: You are. So Keyleth, while you're submerged
under the acid, all of a sudden there's a spray of

2260
02:24:20,181 --> 02:24:25,316
greenish light that coasts through the surface of
the water and beams across you, and you feel a

2261
02:24:25,316 --> 02:24:30,827
horrible poison take effect on your stomach and
internal system. You're like (groans). You saw it

2262
02:24:30,827 --> 02:24:34,877
burst forth from that cloud of smoke that had been
appearing on that side of the battlefield just

2263
02:24:34,877 --> 02:24:36,308
outside of the water.

2264
02:24:36,308 --> 02:24:37,333
MARISHA: Okay.

2265
02:24:37,333 --> 02:24:40,217
SAM: I used some movement to land. Do I have any
movement left?

2266
02:24:40,217 --> 02:24:45,789
MATT: With your walking movement, yes. You still
have 40 feet left.

2267
02:24:45,789 --> 02:24:47,316
SAM: Then I'd like to go...

2268
02:24:47,316 --> 02:24:49,509
MATT: You are currently here.

2269
02:24:49,509 --> 02:24:52,827
SAM: I'd like to go around to the back of this
wall back here. Yeah.

2270
02:24:52,827 --> 02:24:54,416
MATT: Okay. There you go.

2271
02:24:54,416 --> 02:24:56,334
SAM: And then I'll cast Sanctuary on myself.

2272
02:24:56,334 --> 02:25:01,177
MATT: As a bonus action? Okay. Sanctuary on you.

2273
02:25:01,177 --> 02:25:05,360
TRAVIS: God, really? Balls, wanker, ass.

2274
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:08,742
MATT: All righty. That ends Taryon's turn.

2275
02:25:08,742 --> 02:25:13,577
SAM: I'm still in my sphere, everyone. Don't come
find me.

2276
02:25:13,577 --> 02:25:15,709
LAURA: I heard Grog yell "empty."

2277
02:25:15,709 --> 02:25:18,043
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did it loud.

2278
02:25:18,043 --> 02:25:25,519
MATT: You did, just in time for all the braziers
to go (puff, fiery explosion). I need you to make

2279
02:25:25,519 --> 02:25:27,748
a dexterity saving throw, Grog.

2280
02:25:27,748 --> 02:25:37,412
TRAVIS: I was like, it's the other ones before
the braziers. Shit, ass, nipples. 15.

2281
02:25:37,412 --> 02:25:41,139
MATT: 15? You take four points of fire damage,
reduced to two.

2282
02:25:41,139 --> 02:25:42,505
TRAVIS: Hey!

2283
02:25:42,505 --> 02:25:44,383
MATT: And you're set on fire, but you already
were.

2284
02:25:44,383 --> 02:25:46,981
(laughter)

2285
02:25:46,981 --> 02:25:51,822
MATT: All right. Vex, you're up.

2286
02:25:51,822 --> 02:25:57,472
LAURA: I know where Grog is. I'm going to step
over and attack him.

2287
02:25:57,472 --> 02:26:03,425
MATT: Okay, so you head over to the edge, glance
down, and you see the flames rescind from the

2288
02:26:03,425 --> 02:26:08,238
brazier, and there Grog is patting the side of his
arm. The flames are on his shoulders, but he's

2289
02:26:08,238 --> 02:26:09,926
putting it out on his elbow.

2290
02:26:09,926 --> 02:26:11,490
TRAVIS: Sounds right.

2291
02:26:11,490 --> 02:26:13,430
MATT: All right, go for it.

2292
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:16,466
LAURA: Oh yeah. 30?

2293
02:26:16,466 --> 02:26:17,469
MATT: Yep.

2294
02:26:17,469 --> 02:26:18,832
LAURA: Okay.

2295
02:26:18,832 --> 02:26:25,277
TRAVIS: You're going to attack me over the giant
red dragon?

2296
02:26:25,277 --> 02:26:26,989
MARISHA: I'm under the acid, man.

2297
02:26:26,989 --> 02:26:30,841
LAURA: Yeah. 12 plus two lightning damage.

2298
02:26:30,841 --> 02:26:36,414
TRAVIS: So six and one. Seven.

2299
02:26:36,414 --> 02:26:43,582
LAURA: And then the second one definitely hits.

2300
02:26:43,582 --> 02:26:45,916
MATT: Okay. This is getting close.

2301
02:26:45,916 --> 02:26:51,704
LAURA: 16 plus one lightning damage.

2302
02:26:51,704 --> 02:26:57,594
MATT: So eight, plus one. Nine. Nine damage.
Okay.

2303
02:26:57,594 --> 02:27:05,604
LAURA: And for my bonus action, I'm going to-- oh
god. No.

2304
02:27:05,604 --> 02:27:06,883
TRAVIS: Stay.

2305
02:27:06,883 --> 02:27:11,596
LAURA: No, he can get up to me. I'm going to get
on my broom and I'm going to fly up! I'm going to

2306
02:27:11,596 --> 02:27:13,975
fly into the air for my movement.

2307
02:27:13,975 --> 02:27:20,080
MATT: You spent ten movement moving up to the side
there. You get on your broom, so you get up to

2308
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:30,274
about... we'll say, for the purposes of this, you
can't get too high up here. You get about there.

2309
02:27:30,274 --> 02:27:36,743
LAURA: I don't want to fly up. I want to fly over.
I want to fly away from Grog. No, towards the

2310
02:27:36,743 --> 02:27:38,086
other brazier. Yeah.

2311
02:27:38,086 --> 02:27:40,655
MATT: You can get about there. A little bit over
to this side.

2312
02:27:40,655 --> 02:27:43,215
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do that.

2313
02:27:43,215 --> 02:27:44,964
TRAVIS: About 15 feet up, you said?

2314
02:27:44,964 --> 02:27:48,682
LAURA: Oh god! You know what? Ooh, this could be
real bad.

2315
02:27:48,682 --> 02:27:50,635
MATT: That's what you're doing.

2316
02:27:50,635 --> 02:27:56,795
LAURA: Nope. I'm not. I'm thinking about it. I'm
going to fly. I'm going to be up, but I'm going to

2317
02:27:56,795 --> 02:28:01,225
stay over the roof. This is still stupid. I'm
going to die. Grog's going to kill me.

2318
02:28:01,225 --> 02:28:04,936
MATT: We'll say you're up there.

2319
02:28:04,936 --> 02:28:10,965
LAURA: But further over towards-- I want to hover
over the roof, but towards the other brazier.

2320
02:28:10,965 --> 02:28:14,439
MATT: Right. About here. I'm just putting you--
fine, I'll move it.

2321
02:28:14,439 --> 02:28:19,636
LAURA: Sorry. I got confused, Matt. I thought
that's where you were saying I was.

2322
02:28:19,636 --> 02:28:21,772
MATT: There you go. Roughly, that's where you
are.

2323
02:28:21,772 --> 02:28:22,832
LAURA: Okay.

2324
02:28:22,832 --> 02:28:26,228
MATT: It's a lot to coordinate. That ends your
turn, Vex. Grog, you're up.

2325
02:28:26,228 --> 02:28:34,431
TRAVIS: I was going to leave you alone. I was
going to leave you alone! Fucking dragon sitting

2326
02:28:34,431 --> 02:28:42,778
in a big-ass pool of acid. Piece of shit! And then
the spiral's going to go off. Fuck it. I'm going

2327
02:28:42,778 --> 02:28:48,604
to-- yeehaw howdy. Can I go to the rope ladder?
How much does that take,

2328
02:28:48,604 --> 02:28:49,894
to get to the rope ladder?

2329
02:28:49,894 --> 02:28:54,991
MATT: The wood ladder here? That is five, ten,
15.

2330
02:28:54,991 --> 02:29:01,162
TRAVIS: 15. Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to
jump 15 feet vertically?

2331
02:29:01,162 --> 02:29:03,196
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll.

2332
02:29:03,196 --> 02:29:06,098
TRAVIS: That's all I need. 25.

2333
02:29:06,098 --> 02:29:09,524
MATT: You get halfway up.

2334
02:29:09,524 --> 02:29:12,595
TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my movement
to climb up onto the turret

2335
02:29:12,595 --> 02:29:14,336
and move to the far end?

2336
02:29:14,336 --> 02:29:20,498
MATT: Yeah. You get up to right about there, and
you have ten more feet. This way? Okay.

2337
02:29:20,498 --> 02:29:23,728
TRAVIS: Can I see Vex?

2338
02:29:23,728 --> 02:29:25,402
MATT: Oh yeah.

2339
02:29:25,402 --> 02:29:29,439
TRAVIS: (whoosh)

2340
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:32,158
LAURA: Hi, Grog.

2341
02:29:32,158 --> 02:29:34,872
(laughter)

2342
02:29:34,872 --> 02:29:36,057
TRAVIS: Reckless, please.

2343
02:29:36,057 --> 02:29:37,205
MATT: Okay.

2344
02:29:37,205 --> 02:29:40,757
TRAVIS: 25.

2345
02:29:40,757 --> 02:29:43,262
LAURA: Oh, it hits me.

2346
02:29:43,262 --> 02:29:45,754
TRAVIS: 19.

2347
02:29:45,754 --> 02:29:46,840
LAURA: Doesn't.

2348
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:48,481
TRAVIS: No, that's the damage.

2349
02:29:48,481 --> 02:29:49,700
LAURA: Oh. Shit.

2350
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:51,581
(laughter)

2351
02:29:51,581 --> 02:30:00,299
TRAVIS: That's a million. That's 34 to hit.

2352
02:30:00,299 --> 02:30:01,849
LAURA: Oh, 34 to hit.

2353
02:30:01,849 --> 02:30:04,592
MATT: Grog, you took another four points of fire
damage, reduced to two, from the fire.

2354
02:30:04,592 --> 02:30:10,529
TRAVIS: And the damage is 24.

2355
02:30:10,529 --> 02:30:12,076
LAURA: Oh god.

2356
02:30:12,076 --> 02:30:13,547
TRAVIS: Last one.

2357
02:30:13,547 --> 02:30:14,985
LAURA: Oh dear lord.

2358
02:30:14,985 --> 02:30:19,632
SAM: So the hammer keeps coming back, and he
throws it again? Oh, wow.

2359
02:30:19,632 --> 02:30:23,638
MATT: (throwing noises) It's nasty.

2360
02:30:23,638 --> 02:30:26,145
TRAVIS: That is a 25.

2361
02:30:26,145 --> 02:30:30,083
LAURA: Oh no! I think my math is wrong. Hold on.

2362
02:30:30,083 --> 02:30:31,648
TRAVIS: You did it right.

2363
02:30:31,648 --> 02:30:39,763
LAURA: Hold on, that doesn't make sense. 25, you
say?

2364
02:30:39,763 --> 02:30:41,449
TALIESIN: Points of damage.

2365
02:30:41,449 --> 02:30:44,972
LAURA: Oh no, I just dropped unconscious.

2366
02:30:44,972 --> 02:30:48,994
(laughter)

2367
02:30:48,994 --> 02:30:51,696
LAURA: I stayed over the roof.

2368
02:30:51,696 --> 02:30:58,199
MATT: You stayed over the roof. You fall prone.
You still take a point of bludgeoning damage,

2369
02:30:58,266 --> 02:31:02,676
which is an immediate failed save, so you've lost
one death save and you're unconscious there.

2370
02:31:02,676 --> 02:31:05,144
TRAVIS: And you're trapped up here with me.

2371
02:31:05,144 --> 02:31:06,907
SAM: He'll go easy on you.

2372
02:31:06,907 --> 02:31:14,425
LAURA: Yeah, I'm sure. Kill me quickly so I can go
pee, because I've had to for an hour now.

2373
02:31:14,425 --> 02:31:16,281
MATT: That end your turn, Grog?

2374
02:31:16,281 --> 02:31:17,498
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

2375
02:31:17,498 --> 02:31:27,429
MATT: All righty. Keyleth. You don't know where
anybody is. You're in acid water.

2376
02:31:27,429 --> 02:31:33,551
MARISHA: I poke my head out. Do I see anything?

2377
02:31:33,551 --> 02:31:34,999
MATT: Perception check.

2378
02:31:34,999 --> 02:31:38,342
SAM: A bunch of smoke.

2379
02:31:38,342 --> 02:31:42,258
MARISHA: Okay. 21.

2380
02:31:42,258 --> 02:31:49,322
MATT: From this perspective? Not really. You do
see Vex go (thud).

2381
02:31:49,322 --> 02:31:53,965
MARISHA: Cool. I've got a good idea. I'm going to
fly up.

2382
02:31:53,965 --> 02:31:56,266
MATT: How far up are you going to fly?

2383
02:31:56,266 --> 02:31:59,537
MARISHA: How high is the tower? (stutters)

2384
02:31:59,537 --> 02:32:05,711
MATT: It's about 35 feet to the top. 35 feet to
the top edge.

2385
02:32:05,711 --> 02:32:10,857
MARISHA: I've got a flying speed of 80 feet, so
I'm going to go 40 feet up.

2386
02:32:10,857 --> 02:32:22,656
MATT: You see Vex unconscious on the ground there,
bleeding out of the side of the mouth, and you see

2387
02:32:22,656 --> 02:32:24,031
a giant Grog.

2388
02:32:24,031 --> 02:32:25,581
TALIESIN: On fire.

2389
02:32:25,581 --> 02:32:30,911
MATT: On fire, with the hammer pulling back. Grog,
you look over your shoulder and you see a big

2390
02:32:30,911 --> 02:32:32,511
black dragon (whoosh).

2391
02:32:32,511 --> 02:32:37,444
MARISHA: I look at him and I say in Draconic,
because I always forget. I go, Grog, check it out!

2392
02:32:37,444 --> 02:32:39,472
Grog, look!

2393
02:32:39,472 --> 02:32:47,111
MATT: The dragon goes (guttural growling speech).

2394
02:32:47,121 --> 02:32:53,648
MARISHA: I'm going to be like, sorry, but I've
always wanted to do this. (vomit noises) And do an

2395
02:32:53,648 --> 02:32:58,335
acid breath. 60-foot line, five-foot wide.

2396
02:32:58,335 --> 02:33:00,129
SAM: You're trashed.

2397
02:33:00,129 --> 02:33:03,417
TRAVIS: Fire elemental, back to Keyleth, into a
dragon?

2398
02:33:03,417 --> 02:33:04,730
LAURA: Come on.

2399
02:33:04,730 --> 02:33:07,991
MATT: To be fair, you guys focused on each other
for most of this fight.

2400
02:33:07,991 --> 02:33:10,036
TRAVIS: That's true.

2401
02:33:10,036 --> 02:33:13,700
MATT: I need you to make a dexterity saving throw,
Grog.

2402
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:19,857
TRAVIS: Thank you. Thank you, sir. May I have
another? 17.

2403
02:33:19,857 --> 02:33:24,597
MATT: That does not succeed. Keyleth, I need you
to roll your 12d8 acid damage

2404
02:33:24,597 --> 02:33:26,591
that Grog's about to take.

2405
02:33:26,591 --> 02:33:30,383
LAURA: Oh, are you immune to acid damage?

2406
02:33:30,383 --> 02:33:31,539
TRAVIS: No.

2407
02:33:31,539 --> 02:33:33,056
MATT: Nor resistant.

2408
02:33:33,056 --> 02:33:42,430
MARISHA: I'll roll five and then I'll roll five
more. Actually, give me one more and I'll roll

2409
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:47,260
twice. Get that out of there.

2410
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:50,968
TALIESIN: And ones you reroll, right?

2411
02:33:50,968 --> 02:33:52,353
MARISHA: Yeah.

2412
02:33:52,353 --> 02:33:55,422
TALIESIN: (cackles)

2413
02:33:55,422 --> 02:34:06,600
MARISHA: 16, plus let's do these two twos, which
is four, which brings us to 20, plus another 12,

2414
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:22,232
so that brings us to 32. And then I roll again.
32, plus another 14, which is going to be 46, plus

2415
02:34:22,232 --> 02:34:36,919
three, which is 49, plus another six, which is 55,
plus another eight and another seven. 55 plus--

2416
02:34:36,919 --> 02:34:38,374
TALIESIN: 70.

2417
02:34:38,374 --> 02:34:40,366
MARISHA: 70, total. Acid damage.

2418
02:34:40,366 --> 02:34:48,978
MATT: (guttural growling) There's a stream of acid
that sprays down the tower over you, Grog. Go

2419
02:34:48,978 --> 02:34:53,813
ahead and make your constitution saving throw.

2420
02:34:53,813 --> 02:34:58,227
SAM: Tary versus a dragon. This is Dragon Slayer.

2421
02:34:58,227 --> 02:35:02,591
TRAVIS: 21.

2422
02:35:02,591 --> 02:35:10,035
MATT: So as the acid sprays over Grog, Grog still
stands there, covered in acid and looks at you. It

2423
02:35:10,035 --> 02:35:11,239
puts out the fire.

2424
02:35:11,239 --> 02:35:14,621
MARISHA: Do you have one hit point left, or some
shit?

2425
02:35:14,621 --> 02:35:18,973
MATT: Barbarians have an ability where when they
go to zero hit points, they make a constitution

2426
02:35:18,973 --> 02:35:21,073
saving throw to resist going to zero.

2427
02:35:21,073 --> 02:35:23,062
LAURA: What is he at, then?

2428
02:35:23,062 --> 02:35:23,982
TRAVIS: One.

2429
02:35:23,982 --> 02:35:25,106
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2430
02:35:25,106 --> 02:35:27,589
MATT: But he's still standing as the acid is
(sizzling).

2431
02:35:27,589 --> 02:35:28,664
TRAVIS: But the fire's out!

2432
02:35:28,664 --> 02:35:32,995
MARISHA: The fire's out, which is ironic because
that means at the top of your turn you could have

2433
02:35:32,995 --> 02:35:40,076
theoretically died. With the remainder of my
movement--

2434
02:35:40,076 --> 02:35:45,203
MATT: Your Hunter's Mark is gone now. You have
your movement.

2435
02:35:45,203 --> 02:35:51,905
MARISHA: I still have more movement. Can I go, oh
fuck! in Draconic and go (boop) right back

2436
02:35:51,905 --> 02:35:53,202
underneath the acid?

2437
02:35:53,202 --> 02:35:55,568
LAURA: She basically pooped. That's what it
sounded like she did.

2438
02:35:55,568 --> 02:35:56,795
MATT: Okay.

2439
02:35:56,795 --> 02:35:59,326
TRAVIS: How much movement do you have?

2440
02:35:59,326 --> 02:36:00,957
MARISHA: I have an 80 fly speed.

2441
02:36:00,957 --> 02:36:10,776
MATT: Into the water. You're mostly submerged
right now. Splashing in and out of the water, it's

2442
02:36:10,776 --> 02:36:15,447
displacing a lot of the acid. Your wings and your
back are still visible.

2443
02:36:15,447 --> 02:36:18,678
All right, that end your turn?

2444
02:36:18,678 --> 02:36:24,090
MARISHA: He doesn't have anything fighting against
three-quarters cover.

2445
02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:29,240
MATT: With that, Taryon.

2446
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:34,389
SAM: Yeah. I'll be fine.

2447
02:36:34,389 --> 02:36:38,725
MATT: You watch this dragon fly up, spray acid
onto the tower,

2448
02:36:38,725 --> 02:36:42,559
and then disappear into the water below.

2449
02:36:42,559 --> 02:36:48,621
SAM: Out of curiosity, where and in what condition
is Percival's dead body?

2450
02:36:48,621 --> 02:36:51,792
MATT: You haven't seen him.

2451
02:36:51,792 --> 02:36:54,046
SAM: Great. Not even when I was in the sky?

2452
02:36:54,046 --> 02:36:58,759
MATT: When you were in the sky, you saw what
looked like a mess in really nice clothing, so you

2453
02:36:58,759 --> 02:37:01,896
saw Percival. The head was pumpkined. It was bad.

2454
02:37:01,896 --> 02:37:03,217
SAM: Okay, then.

2455
02:37:03,217 --> 02:37:09,167
TRAVIS: Are you checking on the state of Percy's
brain?

2456
02:37:09,167 --> 02:37:16,302
SAM: I might need to use it. Can I poke out this
corner?

2457
02:37:16,302 --> 02:37:20,605
TALIESIN: Is that getting closer to the dragon?

2458
02:37:20,605 --> 02:37:23,161
SAM: Is it?

2459
02:37:23,161 --> 02:37:31,689
MATT: Actually, here's the thing real fast. Let me
read this. Frightful presence. You repeat at the

2460
02:37:31,689 --> 02:37:35,223
end of its turn. Make another roll for the end of
your last turn I forgot to make you do.

2461
02:37:35,289 --> 02:37:37,641
SAM: That's a two again.

2462
02:37:37,641 --> 02:37:43,516
MATT: So in theory, you know the dragon's there.
You can't quite move closer to it, and that would

2463
02:37:43,516 --> 02:37:47,465
be considered closer, so you'd have to go around
this way.

2464
02:37:47,465 --> 02:37:55,119
SAM: Where's the door to the thing? It's right
there on the front, right? The door to the tower?

2465
02:37:55,119 --> 02:37:56,676
MATT: The door to the tower is right there, yeah.

2466
02:37:56,676 --> 02:37:58,154
SAM: That's away from the dragon.

2467
02:37:58,154 --> 02:37:59,316
MATT: It is, yeah.

2468
02:37:59,316 --> 02:38:01,226
SAM: I'll use my movement to go there.

2469
02:38:01,226 --> 02:38:02,519
MARISHA: Are you still invisible?

2470
02:38:02,519 --> 02:38:03,423
SAM: Nope.

2471
02:38:03,423 --> 02:38:07,417
MATT: You get there. You see the dragon as you
rush by. The smoke is still there.

2472
02:38:07,417 --> 02:38:09,480
SAM: I poke around the side of the smoke.

2473
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:12,481
MARISHA: I'm like a Florida alligator right now.

2474
02:38:12,481 --> 02:38:15,287
MATT: You move past the smoke and the pillar.

2475
02:38:15,287 --> 02:38:18,640
SAM: And a quick little Prismatic Spray.

2476
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:28,210
MATT: This Flaming Sphere is gone, by the way.
Forgot that. All right, so roll a d8.

2477
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:32,352
TALIESIN: That's a d6.

2478
02:38:32,352 --> 02:38:36,125
SAM: Oh shit. Four again. It's the same.

2479
02:38:36,125 --> 02:38:37,174
MARISHA: Fuck!

2480
02:38:37,174 --> 02:38:40,576
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a dexterity
saving throw, Keyleth.

2481
02:38:40,576 --> 02:38:45,423
MARISHA: Nope. I think that's the exact same thing
I rolled last time.

2482
02:38:45,423 --> 02:38:47,608
MATT: So that's another 10d6 poison damage.

2483
02:38:47,608 --> 02:38:50,215
SAM: Should we call it the same?

2484
02:38:50,215 --> 02:38:51,519
MATT and TALIESIN: No.

2485
02:38:51,519 --> 02:38:55,519
SAM: I don't like to roll this many things!

2486
02:38:55,519 --> 02:38:58,905
TRAVIS: You're actually very fast.

2487
02:38:58,905 --> 02:39:08,158
TALIESIN: Two, four, six, eight, nine, and you
have one. There you go.

2488
02:39:08,158 --> 02:39:15,058
SAM: 35.

2489
02:39:15,058 --> 02:39:17,258
MATT: 35 points of fire damage to you.

2490
02:39:17,258 --> 02:39:19,725
TALIESIN: 35 points of poison.

2491
02:39:19,725 --> 02:39:21,036
MATT: Poison damage, yeah.

2492
02:39:21,036 --> 02:39:25,705
TALIESIN: I'm enjoying being the rules Nazi here.

2493
02:39:25,705 --> 02:39:30,977
MATT: Keyleth, make a constitution saving throw.

2494
02:39:30,977 --> 02:39:39,526
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Don't fuck me. That's
good. That's even better. 24.

2495
02:39:39,526 --> 02:39:44,322
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You maintain your
concentration. Okay, and?

2496
02:39:44,322 --> 02:39:51,953
SAM: Going into the tower. I have a bunch of
movement left, right?

2497
02:39:51,953 --> 02:39:53,262
MATT: You do, yeah.

2498
02:39:53,262 --> 02:39:54,747
SAM: I'll go into the tower.

2499
02:39:54,747 --> 02:39:59,805
MATT: You have your boots and the potion, so your
movement is 160?

2500
02:39:59,805 --> 02:40:00,825
SAM: 120.

2501
02:40:00,825 --> 02:40:05,823
MATT: 120. Yeah, you can go anywhere in that tower
if you wanted to. There's this floor, there's the

2502
02:40:05,823 --> 02:40:08,066
second floor, there's a third floor, and then
there's the hatch through the top.

2503
02:40:08,066 --> 02:40:09,844
SAM: Ooh, there's floors?

2504
02:40:09,844 --> 02:40:10,810
MATT: Yeah.

2505
02:40:10,810 --> 02:40:14,100
SAM: I'm going to go into the second floor, that
has those little...

2506
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:17,477
TRAVIS: Yeah, the little slit windows?

2507
02:40:17,477 --> 02:40:20,093
SAM: Yeah. Is there any that can see the dragon,
or no?

2508
02:40:20,093 --> 02:40:28,709
MATT: This is a stairway, which blocks this.
Technically, that's just there, so you can fit up

2509
02:40:28,709 --> 02:40:34,789
into here, and you don't technically see the
dragon from that. You can glance over to the side

2510
02:40:34,789 --> 02:40:38,921
of here and poke your head through the stairs and
look and be like (whimpers).

2511
02:40:38,921 --> 02:40:45,998
SAM: I'll look, get a bead, and then just duck
back so no one knows where I am.

2512
02:40:45,998 --> 02:40:48,029
And also Sanctuary.

2513
02:40:48,029 --> 02:40:52,617
MATT: And also Sanctuary. One more. Sanctuary's
not there, since you used Prismatic Spray.

2514
02:40:52,617 --> 02:40:54,700
LAURA: I know, right?

2515
02:40:54,700 --> 02:40:56,138
MARISHA: Just hide.

2516
02:40:56,138 --> 02:41:00,070
LAURA: I mean, come on, that would've been the
absolute best thing to do.

2517
02:41:00,070 --> 02:41:02,119
TALIESIN: Just hide and be extremely inconvenient
to Matt.

2518
02:41:02,119 --> 02:41:03,341
TRAVIS: It is a strategy.

2519
02:41:03,341 --> 02:41:10,640
MARISHA: Yeah, you're called a dirty camper. A
camper! Like someone

2520
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:13,565
who camps in first-person shooters.

2521
02:41:13,565 --> 02:41:16,016
SAM: That's me. That's exactly me.

2522
02:41:16,016 --> 02:41:21,221
MATT: All righty, so make a wisdom saving throw to
see if you can resist the frightened effect.

2523
02:41:21,221 --> 02:41:22,459
SAM: 15!

2524
02:41:22,459 --> 02:41:23,421
MATT: Plus?

2525
02:41:23,421 --> 02:41:24,544
SAM: Minus one.

2526
02:41:24,544 --> 02:41:27,768
MATT: Minus one? Nope. You're still frightened.
You're still like, "Oh god, dragon!"

2527
02:41:27,768 --> 02:41:31,119
LAURA: Damn, I wish my thing wasn't busted. I
would put him in the--

2528
02:41:31,119 --> 02:41:32,101
TRAVIS: I know.

2529
02:41:32,101 --> 02:41:41,125
MATT: All righty, top of the round. The pillars
once again (vibration) and begin to affect this

2530
02:41:41,125 --> 02:41:47,315
area around these pillars, beginning to call
gravity to the ground. All righty. That brings us

2531
02:41:47,315 --> 02:41:50,776
to... Vex, roll a death saving throw.

2532
02:41:50,776 --> 02:41:54,464
LAURA: Save.

2533
02:41:54,464 --> 02:42:00,233
MATT: Yeah, okay. Grog, your turn.

2534
02:42:00,233 --> 02:42:09,237
TRAVIS: Standing there, with one hit point, acid
melting my flesh, I would like to pull out the

2535
02:42:09,237 --> 02:42:10,918
Deck of Many Things.

2536
02:42:10,918 --> 02:42:14,846
MARISHA: Oh, you dick! You dick!

2537
02:42:14,917 --> 02:42:20,255
(laughter)

2538
02:42:20,255 --> 02:42:22,562
LAURA: He has the actual, Matt!

2539
02:42:22,562 --> 02:42:28,511
TRAVIS: I actually have this. It's blocked on the
back, and each card represents each one of them.

2540
02:42:28,511 --> 02:42:30,148
You can check it, if it's good.

2541
02:42:30,148 --> 02:42:33,522
MATT: Well, I'll have to pare down the deck, since
we don't have the full deck here. It's a half

2542
02:42:33,522 --> 02:42:35,552
deck. Where did you get this?

2543
02:42:35,552 --> 02:42:41,320
TRAVIS: I think that's... It was a gift from a
fan.

2544
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:44,076
MATT: Oh man. I'm going to do this.

2545
02:42:44,076 --> 02:42:47,752
SAM: Thank you, Critters, for all the cool, useful
stuff.

2546
02:42:47,752 --> 02:42:52,942
TRAVIS: I also have to name a number of cards that
I would like to pull.

2547
02:42:52,942 --> 02:42:54,680
MATT: This is very true.

2548
02:42:54,680 --> 02:43:00,255
TALIESIN: I'm so sad I'm dead right now. This
would've been worth everything.

2549
02:43:00,255 --> 02:43:02,336
MATT: You may not be in a moment! Who knows?

2550
02:43:02,336 --> 02:43:03,686
TALIESIN: Good god.

2551
02:43:03,686 --> 02:43:08,195
MATT: Okay, so starting from here, we have...

2552
02:43:08,195 --> 02:43:20,713
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you. This is the end of
Cabin in the Woods. I'm so impressed. Lighting a

2553
02:43:20,713 --> 02:43:23,001
cigarette at the end of the world.

2554
02:43:23,001 --> 02:43:28,099
TRAVIS: There's not a ton that could help me, but
fuck it.

2555
02:43:28,099 --> 02:43:35,138
MATT: Thanks for your patience, guys.

2556
02:43:35,138 --> 02:43:37,559
TRAVIS: No, take your sweet time.

2557
02:43:37,559 --> 02:43:41,451
SAM: What do we have in the store right now,
Laura?

2558
02:43:41,451 --> 02:43:43,902
LAURA: Oh, we have t-shirts...

2559
02:43:43,902 --> 02:43:45,538
SAM: What do they say on them?

2560
02:43:45,538 --> 02:43:51,319
LAURA: We have Gilmore's Glorious Goods, we have
Vox Machina t-shirts, we have How Do You Want to

2561
02:43:51,319 --> 02:43:52,768
Do This? t-shirts...

2562
02:43:52,768 --> 02:43:58,350
SAM: I feel like people should go to the store and get
stuff now, because when the 100th episode runs

2563
02:43:58,350 --> 02:44:03,263
around, some of those items might be dropped from
the store and replaced with new stuff.

2564
02:44:03,263 --> 02:44:04,705
LAURA: You never know.

2565
02:44:04,705 --> 02:44:07,337
SAM: I don't know, actually. I literally don't
know.

2566
02:44:07,337 --> 02:44:09,391
TALIESIN: He literally has no idea.

2567
02:44:09,391 --> 02:44:12,267
TRAVIS: It's not like we've been planning for a
100th episode or anything.

2568
02:44:12,267 --> 02:44:13,418
LAURA: No.

2569
02:44:13,418 --> 02:44:15,974
SAM: So if you want these items, you got to get
them now.

2570
02:44:15,974 --> 02:44:18,926
TALIESIN: We should totally do that. We should
plan something.

2571
02:44:18,926 --> 02:44:20,635
TRAVIS: We should. When is the 100th?

2572
02:44:20,635 --> 02:44:28,974
LAURA: It's in a couple weeks, right? Is that
enough time to plan anything? Two weeks from now?

2573
02:44:28,974 --> 02:44:31,423
We could throw something together, right?

2574
02:44:31,423 --> 02:44:34,107
MARISHA: I'll get a cake from Porto's.

2575
02:44:34,107 --> 02:44:36,700
SAM: That's it?

2576
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:40,817
MATT: So Grog. How many cards do you want to
pull?

2577
02:44:40,817 --> 02:44:42,932
SAM: Five cards?!

2578
02:44:42,932 --> 02:44:45,404
MATT: (giggling) Five? Five cards?

2579
02:44:45,404 --> 02:44:49,181
TALIESIN: Yeah! Do it, I'm so proud of you!

2580
02:44:49,232 --> 02:44:53,536
SAM: It's chaos, and you're not even going to be
here to deal with it! I'm in a house with this

2581
02:44:53,536 --> 02:44:56,090
stuff! It's going to be me!

2582
02:44:56,090 --> 02:45:00,709
MARISHA: Tary versus many horrible things.

2583
02:45:00,709 --> 02:45:03,133
TALIESIN: No good, really bad day.

2584
02:45:03,133 --> 02:45:09,956
LAURA: Oh my god, it's going to be a grim reaper
that comes out and kills Grog immediately.

2585
02:45:09,956 --> 02:45:11,254
TRAVIS: Do you want to pick one for me?

2586
02:45:11,254 --> 02:45:12,539
LAURA: Can I? Okay!

2587
02:45:12,539 --> 02:45:15,491
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Choose the form of your
destroyer.

2588
02:45:15,491 --> 02:45:18,242
TRAVIS: Wait, keep it face-down when you pick it.

2589
02:45:18,242 --> 02:45:21,169
MATT: Okay. Five cards. Here, you guys got to
pick, all right.

2590
02:45:21,169 --> 02:45:22,393
TRAVIS: Okay, I get four, you get one.

2591
02:45:22,393 --> 02:45:23,584
LAURA: Okay!

2592
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:25,050
TRAVIS: One, two...

2593
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:33,738
MATT: Keep track of the order. The final one
there. Okay, so Vex is the last one.

2594
02:45:33,738 --> 02:45:36,220
SAM: We're never going to get that far.

2595
02:45:36,220 --> 02:45:37,820
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

2596
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:44,576
MATT: Okay. Grog, first card. What did you pull?

2597
02:45:44,576 --> 02:45:48,153
TRAVIS: Ruin.

2598
02:45:48,153 --> 02:45:52,825
SAM: End of game.

2599
02:45:52,825 --> 02:45:54,689
LAURA: What is Ruin?

2600
02:45:54,689 --> 02:46:00,317
TRAVIS: The picture is a cliff exploding and a
body flying off to his death.

2601
02:46:00,317 --> 02:46:03,532
SAM: That's literally what's about to happen.

2602
02:46:03,532 --> 02:46:18,703
MATT: Grog. Weirdly, not much happens to you that
you notice in the moment. At all.

2603
02:46:18,703 --> 02:46:21,395
TRAVIS: Great.

2604
02:46:21,395 --> 02:46:23,892
TALIESIN: Oh, I know how Ruin works.

2605
02:46:23,892 --> 02:46:30,785
MATT: Your Bag of Holding's fucking empty now, and
all of your non-magical items are gone.

2606
02:46:30,785 --> 02:46:32,192
SAM: Oh, you're just poor.

2607
02:46:32,192 --> 02:46:33,960
MATT: All of your personal wealth is gone.

2608
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:39,035
MARISHA: What about his weapons and all of this
shit, too?

2609
02:46:39,035 --> 02:46:47,052
MATT: Magical items are not affected. It's
non-magical. You're no longer a Grand Poobah in

2610
02:46:47,052 --> 02:46:51,706
this temporary alternate universe. So that
probably was one of the better cards you could've

2611
02:46:51,706 --> 02:46:55,414
pulled. What's the second card, Grog?

2612
02:46:55,414 --> 02:46:56,902
TRAVIS: Rogue?

2613
02:46:56,902 --> 02:46:58,283
MATT: Okay.

2614
02:46:58,283 --> 02:47:01,277
LAURA: It looks terrible.

2615
02:47:01,277 --> 02:47:06,914
TRAVIS: An individual standing in front of a devil
with five swords going through his torso.

2616
02:47:06,914 --> 02:47:12,039
MATT: Okay, so no discernible effect at the
moment.

2617
02:47:12,039 --> 02:47:13,409
MARISHA: What?

2618
02:47:13,409 --> 02:47:15,352
LAURA: What does that one do?

2619
02:47:15,352 --> 02:47:19,627
MATT: But I'll say for the hell of it: Should you
survive this battle, it's going to be really rough

2620
02:47:19,627 --> 02:47:23,102
one day to have Wilhand stab you in your sleep.

2621
02:47:23,102 --> 02:47:29,271
TRAVIS: Oh, it turns somebody against you? All
right. Third card.

2622
02:47:29,271 --> 02:47:34,096
MATT: While you're sitting there, and you're
resting one night, Wilhand's like (growls).

2623
02:47:34,096 --> 02:47:38,612
TRAVIS: If I survive this, and I'm acid-melted and
laying there dying, and he walks up with a little

2624
02:47:38,612 --> 02:47:42,496
butter knife, I'll be like, do it! Just do it!

2625
02:47:42,496 --> 02:47:44,505
MATT: All right. Third card.

2626
02:47:44,505 --> 02:47:45,799
TRAVIS: Star.

2627
02:47:45,799 --> 02:47:47,584
LAURA: Oh, it looks good. It looks like a good
one.

2628
02:47:47,584 --> 02:47:50,020
TRAVIS: Which, it seems to be the opposite of
what's been happening, so maybe I'm fucked.

2629
02:47:50,020 --> 02:47:52,303
MATT: Increase one of your ability scores by two.

2630
02:47:52,303 --> 02:47:59,219
TRAVIS: Hey! Life score! Kill dragon score! Health
score?

2631
02:47:59,219 --> 02:48:00,539
LAURA: Intelligence!

2632
02:48:00,539 --> 02:48:02,783
MATT: You can increase your constitution by two.

2633
02:48:02,783 --> 02:48:03,814
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

2634
02:48:03,814 --> 02:48:06,338
MATT: Okay, so your hit points now go up by 17.

2635
02:48:06,338 --> 02:48:07,395
TRAVIS: That's important.

2636
02:48:07,395 --> 02:48:09,710
SAM: Does he have 18 hit points now?

2637
02:48:09,710 --> 02:48:10,938
MATT: Yes, he does.

2638
02:48:10,938 --> 02:48:11,697
MARISHA: Really?

2639
02:48:11,697 --> 02:48:14,304
MATT: Yeah, because it automatically increases his
modifier by one.

2640
02:48:14,304 --> 02:48:16,266
TRAVIS: I'm coming.

2641
02:48:16,266 --> 02:48:17,832
MATT: All right.

2642
02:48:17,832 --> 02:48:19,100
TRAVIS: We'll see.

2643
02:48:19,100 --> 02:48:20,542
MATT: Fourth card?

2644
02:48:20,542 --> 02:48:23,130
TRAVIS: Key.

2645
02:48:23,130 --> 02:48:26,403
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

2646
02:48:26,403 --> 02:48:27,675
MATT: Okay.

2647
02:48:27,675 --> 02:48:31,312
LAURA: Is this a good one, too?
It looks good.

2648
02:48:31,312 --> 02:48:34,454
MATT: This is the one I thought you had pulled
originally. A rare or rarer magical item.

2649
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:36,869
SAM: Oh, you get a cool thing!

2650
02:48:36,869 --> 02:48:42,918
LAURA: I hope I've cursed him! Please let me have
cursed him!

2651
02:48:42,918 --> 02:48:47,229
TRAVIS: I want the one that lets me succeed on my
next venture.

2652
02:48:47,229 --> 02:48:49,791
MATT: I'm going to roll randomly for this real
fast.

2653
02:48:49,791 --> 02:48:54,124
MARISHA: That one automatically succeeds at
something? Bring it, bitch.

2654
02:48:54,124 --> 02:48:57,965
TALIESIN: This is amazing.

2655
02:48:57,965 --> 02:49:01,528
TRAVIS: I should've just picked seven. I picked
five; that was good.

2656
02:49:01,528 --> 02:49:04,050
LAURA: Five is a lot. Five is as high as you can
count.

2657
02:49:04,050 --> 02:49:06,785
MARISHA: That's true. That's how many fingers you
have.

2658
02:49:06,785 --> 02:49:08,289
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2659
02:49:08,289 --> 02:49:11,610
TALIESIN: That's the highest number you really
know. Everything is just more fives.

2660
02:49:11,610 --> 02:49:16,689
MARISHA: Grog lives in intervals of fives.

2661
02:49:16,689 --> 02:49:27,889
MATT: A beautiful black and ivory-inlaid sword
shows up, a greatsword shows up in your hand. You

2662
02:49:27,889 --> 02:49:29,701
have to attune to it, unfortunately.

2663
02:49:29,701 --> 02:49:32,939
TRAVIS: Right. I got 30 minutes to waste. Just
sitting here melting.

2664
02:49:32,939 --> 02:49:37,595
MATT: And then, what's the next card?

2665
02:49:37,595 --> 02:49:39,830
LAURA: Oh no, this looks good, too.

2666
02:49:39,830 --> 02:49:42,177
TRAVIS: The Knight.

2667
02:49:42,177 --> 02:49:44,665
MATT: (giggles)

2668
02:49:44,665 --> 02:49:46,146
LAURA: Does he get a wish?

2669
02:49:46,146 --> 02:49:50,102
MARISHA: Did he get something stupid? He's going
to the bag.

2670
02:49:50,102 --> 02:49:52,491
SAM: You get a horse or something.

2671
02:49:52,491 --> 02:49:56,170
MARISHA: Grog becomes cavalry.

2672
02:49:56,170 --> 02:49:59,182
LAURA: Please be on top of the tower on a horse.

2673
02:49:59,182 --> 02:50:03,185
MATT: You look at the card for a second like,
"Huh, what does this do?" And you hear a voice go

2674
02:50:03,185 --> 02:50:07,201
(clears throat). You look to your side, and there
is a gentleman with armor and weapons who goes,

2675
02:50:07,201 --> 02:50:15,523
"Sir Grog! I am here to serve you! Whatever you
need, let me know! My life for Strongjaw!"

2676
02:50:15,523 --> 02:50:19,227
(laughter)

2677
02:50:19,227 --> 02:50:22,246
TRAVIS: Do you have any health potions on you?

2678
02:50:22,246 --> 02:50:26,533
MATT: "Oh, goodness, sir! Are you all right?"

2679
02:50:26,533 --> 02:50:31,979
TRAVIS: Things are very bad. It's dire stakes.
Kill the dragon.

2680
02:50:31,979 --> 02:50:33,279
MATT: "Dragon?"

2681
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:38,662
TRAVIS: Yeah, dragon. Your courage is most
important at this dire hour!

2682
02:50:38,662 --> 02:50:40,858
MATT: Okay, you control this character. You tell
him whatever to do.

2683
02:50:40,858 --> 02:50:43,602
So you have a 4th-level fighter.

2684
02:50:43,602 --> 02:50:45,103
TRAVIS: 4th-level!

2685
02:50:45,103 --> 02:50:48,338
MATT: Yeah. However, he's the same race as you, so
he's a goliath in full armor.

2686
02:50:48,338 --> 02:50:51,893
TRAVIS: Hey! Sweet. Hold on, come here, I need to
draw some tattoos

2687
02:50:51,893 --> 02:50:53,843
on you to make you look like me.

2688
02:50:53,843 --> 02:50:57,484
MATT: All righty.

2689
02:50:57,484 --> 02:50:59,795
TRAVIS: Awesome.

2690
02:50:59,795 --> 02:51:02,367
SAM: The streak continues with Grog.

2691
02:51:02,367 --> 02:51:09,704
TRAVIS: Right. Okay. I have 18 hit points.
Everybody's alive. That's my turn.

2692
02:51:09,704 --> 02:51:11,038
LAURA: Can you move?

2693
02:51:11,038 --> 02:51:12,823
TRAVIS: Were any of those draw again cards?

2694
02:51:12,823 --> 02:51:13,957
MATT: Nope.

2695
02:51:13,957 --> 02:51:15,080
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool.

2696
02:51:15,080 --> 02:51:16,085
LAURA: Can you move?

2697
02:51:16,085 --> 02:51:20,482
TRAVIS: Oh, I can move, because I'm alive. I live.
At this moment.

2698
02:51:20,482 --> 02:51:22,127
MATT: Yeah.

2699
02:51:22,127 --> 02:51:24,233
TRAVIS: I would like to go down the trapdoor.

2700
02:51:24,233 --> 02:51:27,089
MATT: Okay. What about your friend?

2701
02:51:27,089 --> 02:51:36,023
TRAVIS: Yes, with the friend. No! He's going to
stand up there. Just double birds. Out going like

2702
02:51:36,023 --> 02:51:41,381
this. And he has to go, "I am Grog!" The whole
time.

2703
02:51:41,381 --> 02:51:44,698
MATT: Okay, so you pull down the trap door once
again, and it's small in there.

2704
02:51:44,698 --> 02:51:46,097
How far down do you go?

2705
02:51:46,097 --> 02:51:47,702
TRAVIS: The second level.

2706
02:51:47,702 --> 02:51:50,864
MATT: You go down to the second level and as you
crawl down, you look and you see Taryon there,

2707
02:51:50,864 --> 02:51:58,612
looking out a window, looking very scared.

2708
02:51:58,612 --> 02:52:00,015
SAM: Where's your skin?

2709
02:52:00,015 --> 02:52:01,484
TRAVIS: (grunts)

2710
02:52:01,484 --> 02:52:04,836
SAM: (shrieks) No! It bounces off my Sanctuary!

2711
02:52:04,836 --> 02:52:13,361
MATT: You re-cast Sanctuary on yourself, right?

2712
02:52:13,361 --> 02:52:14,742
SAM: Yeah, I did.

2713
02:52:14,742 --> 02:52:16,879
MATT: All right, so that's your turn, Grog.

2714
02:52:16,879 --> 02:52:17,911
TRAVIS: That's it.

2715
02:52:17,911 --> 02:52:25,032
MATT: As your knight's double fingering towards
the... Gotcha. Whoa, this got weird. Okay.

2716
02:52:25,032 --> 02:52:26,790
Keyleth, it's your turn.

2717
02:52:26,790 --> 02:52:33,123
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to come back out of the
acid. (war cry) What do I see? I look towards

2718
02:52:33,123 --> 02:52:34,645
where Grog was.

2719
02:52:34,645 --> 02:52:38,597
MATT: You look up and you see a goliath in full
armor just going...

2720
02:52:38,597 --> 02:52:45,289
MARISHA: (war cry) I'm going to fly over, and I'm
going to land on top of the tower, and I'm going

2721
02:52:45,289 --> 02:52:51,695
to do a multiattack against him. (heavy impacts)
And frightful presence. I don't know if that

2722
02:52:51,695 --> 02:52:54,378
affects an imaginary knight from a deck of cards.

2723
02:52:54,378 --> 02:52:58,431
MATT: It does! Go ahead and roll a wisdom saving
throw for the knight.

2724
02:52:58,431 --> 02:53:02,944
LAURA: Is that a 20?

2725
02:53:02,944 --> 02:53:04,788
TRAVIS: It's a three.

2726
02:53:04,788 --> 02:53:11,701
MATT: Jeez. He's like, "Dragon! Where--" (screams)
As you land next to him,

2727
02:53:11,701 --> 02:53:14,871
he's like (weak chuckle)

2728
02:53:14,871 --> 02:53:20,932
TRAVIS: Poor bastard. Into creation for, what, 30
seconds?

2729
02:53:20,932 --> 02:53:23,943
MATT: So full multiattack on this guy, you said,
right?

2730
02:53:23,943 --> 02:53:25,613
MARISHA: Yep, bite and two claws.

2731
02:53:25,613 --> 02:53:27,766
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll some attacks
here.

2732
02:53:27,766 --> 02:53:31,768
MARISHA: That's a natural 19 on the first one.

2733
02:53:31,768 --> 02:53:32,972
MATT: Okay, that'll hit.

2734
02:53:32,972 --> 02:53:40,569
MARISHA: So that's 30. Not so good on the second
one. That's 15.

2735
02:53:40,569 --> 02:53:42,599
MATT: Okay, 15 does not hit.

2736
02:53:42,599 --> 02:53:52,064
MARISHA: Okay, and then on the third, that's a
seven plus 11, so 18.

2737
02:53:52,064 --> 02:53:53,392
MATT: 18 does hit.

2738
02:53:53,392 --> 02:53:54,481
MARISHA: So two attacks.

2739
02:53:54,481 --> 02:53:55,863
MATT: Yep, two attacks hit.

2740
02:53:55,863 --> 02:53:58,219
MARISHA: So one bite and one claw, I guess.

2741
02:53:58,219 --> 02:54:00,223
MATT: Sure, go ahead and roll damage.

2742
02:54:00,223 --> 02:54:19,411
MARISHA: 2d10 plus six, plus 1d8 for acid damage.
Oh man, why does this keep happening to me? Okay,

2743
02:54:19,411 --> 02:54:32,769
11 plus seven is 18. Wait, let me make sure I'm
doing this right. No, plus six. 11 plus six, so

2744
02:54:32,769 --> 02:54:45,569
17, and then 1d8. Four. Okay, so he takes 18--
wait, what did I just say? 17 piercing damage, and

2745
02:54:45,569 --> 02:54:48,061
then four acid damage from the bite.

2746
02:54:48,061 --> 02:54:51,384
MATT: Okay, so 21 total. And then your next
strike, the claw?

2747
02:54:51,384 --> 02:55:00,672
MARISHA: Eight plus six is 12. 12 damage.

2748
02:55:00,672 --> 02:55:05,638
MATT: 12 damage. As you strike him (heavy
impacts), he's like (whimpers)

2749
02:55:05,638 --> 02:55:08,462
and he's still alive.

2750
02:55:08,462 --> 02:55:13,672
MARISHA: Okay, can I take the rest of my movement
to fly and hover above?

2751
02:55:13,672 --> 02:55:15,851
TRAVIS: Attack of opportunity.

2752
02:55:15,851 --> 02:55:17,525
MATT: Yes, you do get an attack of opportunity.

2753
02:55:17,525 --> 02:55:18,692
MARISHA: That's fine.

2754
02:55:18,692 --> 02:55:23,673
MATT: All right, so you hover above, we'll say
with your full movement, you don't get too far,

2755
02:55:23,673 --> 02:55:29,187
unfortunately, because you took, to get into that
space up there, would've been 70.

2756
02:55:29,187 --> 02:55:33,518
MARISHA: Would I get out of the sphere of the
electrical attack? Then no, I'll just stay there.

2757
02:55:33,518 --> 02:55:38,762
MATT: Okay. You stay there. Go ahead and roll an
attack for him.

2758
02:55:38,762 --> 02:55:40,254
TRAVIS: What do you think?

2759
02:55:40,254 --> 02:55:42,625
MARISHA: Does he get a retaliation attack?

2760
02:55:42,625 --> 02:55:47,461
MATT: No, if you're not moving, he doesn't. You're
right. Never mind. All right, so bringing it back

2761
02:55:47,461 --> 02:55:48,692
to Taryon.

2762
02:55:48,692 --> 02:56:00,301
SAM: Never thought it would come to this. I hold
up a diamond, and I point it at your face, and I

2763
02:56:00,301 --> 02:56:07,037
say, I will heal you if you swear you will not
stab me in the back.

2764
02:56:07,037 --> 02:56:15,581
TRAVIS: I swear. I want this dragon dead.

2765
02:56:15,581 --> 02:56:17,673
SAM: Insight check!

2766
02:56:17,673 --> 02:56:19,981
MATT: All right, roll an insight check.

2767
02:56:19,981 --> 02:56:25,232
SAM: That's pretty lousy. 11.

2768
02:56:25,232 --> 02:56:32,878
TRAVIS: I swear. Yes. Giant dragon.

2769
02:56:32,878 --> 02:56:37,409
SAM: Healing draught. 9d8.

2770
02:56:37,409 --> 02:56:42,876
MATT: Go ahead. You have to drink it on your turn,
but he hands it to you.

2771
02:56:42,876 --> 02:56:45,627
SAM: I can't use my action to pour it down his
throat?

2772
02:56:45,627 --> 02:56:50,589
MATT: Yeah, you can. You walk up to Grog, and
(cork pop).

2773
02:56:50,589 --> 02:56:51,782
TRAVIS: Give me these things.

2774
02:56:51,782 --> 02:56:53,007
LAURA: What do you want?

2775
02:56:53,007 --> 02:56:56,141
TRAVIS: 9d8! And who rolls them?

2776
02:56:56,141 --> 02:56:58,726
TALIESIN: Here's another question, when was the
last time you hit something?

2777
02:56:58,726 --> 02:57:01,636
TRAVIS: I have persistent rage.

2778
02:57:01,636 --> 02:57:04,632
MATT: He can maintain his rage as long as he
wants. High-level barbarians, man.

2779
02:57:04,632 --> 02:57:08,506
SAM: I will live... to regret this.

2780
02:57:08,506 --> 02:57:10,958
TRAVIS: No! No.

2781
02:57:10,958 --> 02:57:14,757
MATT: Well, there can be only one.

2782
02:57:14,757 --> 02:57:26,812
TRAVIS: 46. 46 plus 18.

2783
02:57:26,812 --> 02:57:29,142
SAM: That's pretty good.

2784
02:57:29,142 --> 02:57:35,808
MATT: So 54? No, 64. 64 health, I think you're
at.

2785
02:57:35,808 --> 02:57:38,192
TRAVIS: I'm at 64, yeah.

2786
02:57:38,192 --> 02:57:40,964
MATT: That's your turn. You can move, Taryon, if
you want to, or do you want to stay put?

2787
02:57:40,964 --> 02:57:48,966
SAM: I don't know what our plan of action is,
so... I can't go up, because I would be scared.

2788
02:57:48,966 --> 02:57:50,968
Do I have to roll for fear again?

2789
02:57:50,968 --> 02:57:53,920
MATT: Yes, at the end of your turn, you do. At the
end of your turn, though. If you're going to move,

2790
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:55,017
move first.

2791
02:57:55,017 --> 02:57:57,783
SAM: I will move down to the bottom floor.

2792
02:57:57,783 --> 02:58:00,244
MATT: Okay, you get down to the bottom floor, and
you're right by the doors, which are now burned

2793
02:58:00,244 --> 02:58:04,565
down entirely. The wood has caught fire and
crumbled in.

2794
02:58:04,565 --> 02:58:07,219
SAM: I still have some movement, right?

2795
02:58:07,219 --> 02:58:09,083
MATT: Yeah, you have a shit-ton of movement.

2796
02:58:09,083 --> 02:58:11,558
SAM: I look up to see if I can see the dragon.

2797
02:58:11,558 --> 02:58:13,625
MATT: You see the edge of a wing going (whoosh).

2798
02:58:13,625 --> 02:58:20,862
SAM: A wing. I'm going to go to the north bunker.

2799
02:58:20,862 --> 02:58:30,142
MATT: Over here? Okay. With that, Taryon, you head
down through here and into this north bunker over

2800
02:58:30,142 --> 02:58:36,577
here. All right. Grog, you're technically in that
room there.

2801
02:58:36,577 --> 02:58:40,382
SAM: All right. And now I roll my fear?

2802
02:58:40,382 --> 02:58:42,632
MATT: Yes, now you roll your fear.

2803
02:58:42,632 --> 02:58:48,830
SAM: 16? 15. What do I have to roll to beat this
thing?

2804
02:58:48,830 --> 02:58:50,504
MARISHA: Yeah, you didn't roll high enough.

2805
02:58:50,504 --> 02:58:51,723
MATT: 18, I think it is?

2806
02:58:51,723 --> 02:58:53,238
SAM: Jesus, I'm never going to do it.

2807
02:58:53,238 --> 02:58:56,345
MATT: Only lasts a minute.

2808
02:58:56,345 --> 02:58:57,746
SAM: Oh, okay.

2809
02:58:57,746 --> 02:58:59,741
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Taryon?

2810
02:58:59,741 --> 02:59:00,973
SAM: Yep.

2811
02:59:00,973 --> 02:59:10,974
MATT: The arcane towers (crackling) send out a
burst of energy. Roll a dexterity saving throw for

2812
02:59:10,974 --> 02:59:13,825
your knight friend, and you roll, as well.

2813
02:59:13,825 --> 02:59:15,133
LAURA: He's not dead?

2814
02:59:15,133 --> 02:59:18,093
TRAVIS: No. 18?

2815
02:59:18,093 --> 02:59:21,038
MARISHA: Oh, that's not that great. I thought that
was better. 15.

2816
02:59:21,038 --> 02:59:23,467
MATT: 18? He succeeds.

2817
02:59:23,467 --> 02:59:25,394
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

2818
02:59:25,394 --> 02:59:35,044
MATT: It would be 16 lightning damage. Instead, he
takes eight. I'll mark that here. He's hurt pretty

2819
02:59:35,044 --> 02:59:38,704
bad, but he's still hanging in there. What did you
roll?

2820
02:59:38,704 --> 02:59:39,629
MARISHA: 15.

2821
02:59:39,629 --> 02:59:45,839
MATT: 15. So you take 16 points of lightning
damage. Go ahead and roll a constitution check.

2822
02:59:45,839 --> 02:59:48,023
MARISHA: A lot. I'm good.

2823
02:59:48,023 --> 02:59:49,314
MATT: Okay.

2824
02:59:49,314 --> 02:59:52,644
LAURA: That's a failed death save for me.

2825
02:59:52,644 --> 02:59:57,646
MATT: And... yeah. How many have you lost now?

2826
02:59:57,646 --> 03:00:00,578
LAURA: That's two fails.

2827
03:00:00,578 --> 03:00:02,231
TRAVIS: What is the point?

2828
03:00:02,231 --> 03:00:05,030
MATT: Now it's your turn. Go ahead and roll
again.

2829
03:00:05,030 --> 03:00:11,148
LAURA: Well, all right. One!

2830
03:00:11,148 --> 03:00:18,961
MATT: And with that, we'll say from a narrative
standpoint, as the lightning sparks out and it

2831
03:00:18,961 --> 03:00:22,452
hits Keyleth in her dragon form, she falls back
and her back foot (squelch)

2832
03:00:22,452 --> 03:00:27,111
accidentally smears Vex.

2833
03:00:27,111 --> 03:00:31,244
TALIESIN: That's going to be hard to clean up.

2834
03:00:31,244 --> 03:00:34,025
LAURA: No fate dice for us, Percy.

2835
03:00:34,025 --> 03:00:40,547
MATT: All right, so that's the end of Vex's turn.
Grog, you're up.

2836
03:00:40,547 --> 03:00:44,315
TRAVIS: I pull out the rest of the-- no, I run up
to the top of the tower.

2837
03:00:44,315 --> 03:00:46,952
TALIESIN: Fear?

2838
03:00:46,952 --> 03:00:50,892
MARISHA: He's immune to fear because barbarian and
raging.

2839
03:00:50,892 --> 03:00:52,763
TRAVIS: I ain't scared.

2840
03:00:52,763 --> 03:00:54,070
MARISHA: He ain't scared.

2841
03:00:54,070 --> 03:01:03,275
TRAVIS: It's absurd. And then she has all of her
hit points left.

2842
03:01:03,275 --> 03:01:09,401
MATT: So Grog, you get up to the top of the hatch
and you come out and you're right there next to

2843
03:01:09,401 --> 03:01:12,681
your goliath friend, in the face of this big
dragon. What are you going to do?

2844
03:01:12,681 --> 03:01:17,580
TRAVIS: I'm going to rush up to the giant red
dragon and go: Yo, Wilfred. This is how it's done,

2845
03:01:17,580 --> 03:01:22,657
lad. And I do all three attacks, reckless, at the
fucking dragon.

2846
03:01:22,657 --> 03:01:24,206
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2847
03:01:24,206 --> 03:01:26,944
SAM: Reckless? You could kill the dragon in one
move.

2848
03:01:26,944 --> 03:01:29,964
TRAVIS: I don't think so. That's a 32?

2849
03:01:29,964 --> 03:01:35,714
MARISHA: To hit? Yeah. He could take me down.

2850
03:01:35,714 --> 03:01:37,614
TRAVIS: 24 on the first one.

2851
03:01:37,614 --> 03:01:39,007
MARISHA: Damage?

2852
03:01:39,007 --> 03:01:43,131
MATT: Before you roll damage on the next one, roll
another constitution saving throw for

2853
03:01:43,131 --> 03:01:45,612
concentration. Beat a 12.

2854
03:01:45,612 --> 03:01:46,472
MARISHA: Yeah.

2855
03:01:46,472 --> 03:01:47,517
MATT: Okay.

2856
03:01:47,517 --> 03:01:49,520
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2857
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:52,946
TALIESIN: You've had a few of those tonight.

2858
03:01:52,946 --> 03:02:05,221
TRAVIS: Okay, so that was a nine, so 25. That was
nine on the die.

2859
03:02:05,221 --> 03:02:11,866
MATT: You rolled a nine on the die. This is the
damage.

2860
03:02:11,866 --> 03:02:13,838
MARISHA: Oh, right.

2861
03:02:13,838 --> 03:02:17,409
MATT: So 18, plus your modifier.

2862
03:02:17,409 --> 03:02:20,718
TRAVIS: So that's 34.

2863
03:02:20,718 --> 03:02:23,470
MATT: Plus two additional dice for the weapon.

2864
03:02:23,470 --> 03:02:33,305
TRAVIS: That's right, yeah. Ten, plus a three.
47.

2865
03:02:33,305 --> 03:02:34,374
MARISHA: Total?

2866
03:02:34,374 --> 03:02:39,971
MATT: 47 points of damage to you. Roll another
constitution saving throw. You have to beat a 23.

2867
03:02:39,971 --> 03:02:48,110
MARISHA: As long as I roll over--

2868
03:02:48,110 --> 03:02:49,310
MATT: Constitution.

2869
03:02:49,310 --> 03:02:50,672
MARISHA: Oh, constitution?

2870
03:02:50,672 --> 03:02:52,875
MATT: It's not wisdom. It's constitution for
these.

2871
03:02:52,875 --> 03:02:54,940
LAURA: Have you been adding your wisdom modifier
this whole time?

2872
03:02:54,940 --> 03:03:05,274
MARISHA: My constitution's all right. I've been
rolling over the minimum, anyway. No. Nope.

2873
03:03:05,274 --> 03:03:07,444
MATT: Keyleth's form drops.

2874
03:03:07,444 --> 03:03:09,262
SAM: Oh shit!

2875
03:03:09,262 --> 03:03:21,124
MATT: The spell drops, losing concentration. Her
form reverts into regular Keyleth again. It wasn't

2876
03:03:21,124 --> 03:03:25,352
damage over. There's Keyleth in front of you. You
still have your third attack.

2877
03:03:25,352 --> 03:03:28,045
TRAVIS: I definitely think about kicking her off
the top of the tower.

2878
03:03:28,045 --> 03:03:29,819
SAM: Of course you do.

2879
03:03:29,819 --> 03:03:34,885
TRAVIS: I think the attack is better. Yep.
Reckless.

2880
03:03:34,885 --> 03:03:37,877
SAM: So many menu options.

2881
03:03:37,877 --> 03:03:43,503
TRAVIS: That hits. 33.

2882
03:03:43,503 --> 03:03:45,451
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage.

2883
03:03:45,451 --> 03:03:46,903
MARISHA: Why were you like, ugh?
You wanted a critical?

2884
03:03:46,903 --> 03:03:50,657
TALIESIN: Don't be greedy.

2885
03:03:50,657 --> 03:03:53,268
TRAVIS: I know. 27.

2886
03:03:53,268 --> 03:03:54,938
MARISHA: Damage total?

2887
03:03:54,938 --> 03:04:01,748
MATT: 27 damage to you, and your friend next to
you, who's no longer frightened because you're no

2888
03:04:01,748 --> 03:04:03,169
longer a dragon.

2889
03:04:03,169 --> 03:04:05,143
MARISHA: He doesn't get to attack, does he?

2890
03:04:05,143 --> 03:04:10,825
MATT: Yeah, he does. He attacks on your turn. He
gets two attacks with his greatsword. Go ahead and

2891
03:04:10,825 --> 03:04:13,012
attack twice for him. Plus five to hit.

2892
03:04:13,012 --> 03:04:17,010
TRAVIS: Plus five to hit. That's a 23.

2893
03:04:17,010 --> 03:04:18,180
MARISHA: Yeah.

2894
03:04:18,180 --> 03:04:21,699
TRAVIS: 24?

2895
03:04:21,699 --> 03:04:25,070
MATT: All right, so 2d6 plus three to each hit.

2896
03:04:25,070 --> 03:04:27,877
SAM: For the honor of Strongjaw!

2897
03:04:27,877 --> 03:04:30,369
MATT: I'll protect you, my lord!

2898
03:04:30,369 --> 03:04:33,289
TRAVIS: Ten, one. You said 2d6 plus one?

2899
03:04:33,289 --> 03:04:34,598
MATT: 2d6 plus three.

2900
03:04:34,598 --> 03:04:36,967
TRAVIS: Right, so that's 13 for the first one.

2901
03:04:36,967 --> 03:04:38,278
MATT: 13 damage.

2902
03:04:38,278 --> 03:04:42,203
TRAVIS: Six, seven. Ten.

2903
03:04:42,203 --> 03:04:43,601
MARISHA: So 23 total.

2904
03:04:43,601 --> 03:04:44,732
MATT and TRAVIS: 23 total.

2905
03:04:44,732 --> 03:04:46,147
MARISHA: Yeah.

2906
03:04:46,147 --> 03:04:52,819
TRAVIS: I thought he was going to be in and out in
a quick Pop Tart flash.

2907
03:04:52,819 --> 03:04:54,780
MATT: Ends your turn, Grog?

2908
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:59,917
TRAVIS: Three attacks, bonus action. Can't do
anything. Yep.

2909
03:04:59,917 --> 03:05:05,560
MATT: Keyleth, you're up. Form has dropped. Grog
is looking healthier than you remember him.

2910
03:05:05,560 --> 03:05:15,494
MARISHA: Grog. We're friends, right? Remember me?
Come here. I'm going to grab him real quick and

2911
03:05:15,494 --> 03:05:17,671
I'm going to do Plane Shift.

2912
03:05:17,671 --> 03:05:21,972
TALIESIN: Whoa!

2913
03:05:21,972 --> 03:05:23,857
MARISHA: It's me, Keyleth! (grunts)

2914
03:05:23,857 --> 03:05:30,104
MATT: Roll a charisma saving throw. I think it's
charisma, right? Plane Shift is a charisma saving

2915
03:05:30,104 --> 03:05:35,770
throw. Grog, roll a charisma saving throw.

2916
03:05:35,770 --> 03:05:41,825
SAM: He's going to break this plane of existence,
too, and come back.

2917
03:05:41,825 --> 03:05:44,763
TRAVIS: It's a 19.

2918
03:05:44,763 --> 03:05:46,772
MATT: What's your charisma?

2919
03:05:46,772 --> 03:05:48,267
TRAVIS: Plus one.

2920
03:05:48,267 --> 03:05:49,473
MATT: So you rolled a 19?

2921
03:05:49,473 --> 03:05:52,409
TRAVIS: It's a 20 with a plus one, but I need a
natural 20, I know.

2922
03:05:52,409 --> 03:05:54,782
MATT: What did you roll on the dice?

2923
03:05:54,782 --> 03:05:55,797
TRAVIS: 19.

2924
03:05:55,797 --> 03:05:56,870
LAURA: Plus one.

2925
03:05:56,870 --> 03:05:58,005
MATT: That's a 20.

2926
03:05:58,005 --> 03:05:59,157
MARISHA: The 20 is what I had.

2927
03:05:59,157 --> 03:06:00,172
MATT: Yeah, so he saves.

2928
03:06:00,172 --> 03:06:02,511
MARISHA: You are lying to me. You are fucking
lying!

2929
03:06:02,511 --> 03:06:03,883
MATT: It's what he rolled!

2930
03:06:03,883 --> 03:06:06,985
TALIESIN: This is what's been happening all
night.

2931
03:06:06,985 --> 03:06:14,115
SAM: The plane of existence. You break it!

2932
03:06:14,115 --> 03:06:19,961
MATT: You resist the effect as Keyleth is holding
onto you, and she slowly lets go,

2933
03:06:19,961 --> 03:06:21,308
shaking a little bit.

2934
03:06:21,308 --> 03:06:23,603
TALIESIN: You have your bonus and your movement.

2935
03:06:23,603 --> 03:06:24,946
MARISHA: I have a bonus and a movement.

2936
03:06:24,946 --> 03:06:25,866
MATT: Yes, you do.

2937
03:06:25,866 --> 03:06:28,310
MARISHA: Okay. Oh god.

2938
03:06:28,310 --> 03:06:29,718
LAURA: Run away!

2939
03:06:29,718 --> 03:06:32,973
MATT: That's your 7th-level spell, gone.

2940
03:06:32,973 --> 03:06:35,720
LAURA: Plane Shift was her 7th-level spell?

2941
03:06:35,720 --> 03:06:50,410
MARISHA: Yeah, it was bad. I'm still all right. I
have a bonus and a movement. Okay. I'm going to...

2942
03:06:50,410 --> 03:06:59,966
take my bonus action to go oh, Grog! And cast a
Grasping Vine.

2943
03:06:59,966 --> 03:07:02,566
MATT: Grasping Vine is 4th-level. You can't cast
it.

2944
03:07:02,566 --> 03:07:15,625
MARISHA: Fuck! Okay. I will do... options are
dwindling very quickly.

2945
03:07:15,625 --> 03:07:18,220
LAURA: Tary will be the survivor because he's
hiding.

2946
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:20,517
SAM: Why, because I haven't taken a single hit
yet?

2947
03:07:20,517 --> 03:07:24,606
MARISHA: I have Freedom of Movement still on me,
though. Does that aid me escaping?

2948
03:07:24,606 --> 03:07:29,030
MATT: Nope. Still gets a swing at you. Both of
them.

2949
03:07:29,030 --> 03:07:42,138
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do a bonus action to
heal myself. Healing Word. Let's do a 3rd-level

2950
03:07:42,138 --> 03:07:44,047
Healing Word.

2951
03:07:44,047 --> 03:07:48,024
MATT: 2nd-level Healing Word. You can't do more
than 2nd-level.

2952
03:07:48,024 --> 03:07:57,143
MARISHA: Sorry. You're right. 2nd-level Healing
Word. So it's 2d4. Oh my god.

2953
03:07:57,143 --> 03:08:01,904
TALIESIN: You are the luckiest motherfucker. This
has all been just--

2954
03:08:01,904 --> 03:08:04,976
LAURA: Why couldn't he have rolled like he did on
the one-shot, where

2955
03:08:04,976 --> 03:08:07,068
it was one after one after one?

2956
03:08:07,068 --> 03:08:10,190
MATT: I can't believe you made that fucking roll!

2957
03:08:10,190 --> 03:08:16,969
TRAVIS: I was like, aw, it has to be a 20. Yeah.
My charisma's plus one.

2958
03:08:16,969 --> 03:08:24,510
MATT: It's the hat. It's the feathered hat. It
pushes it just over.

2959
03:08:24,510 --> 03:08:45,880
MARISHA: 53. Okay. And then I'm going to-- fucking
hell, I'm really tapped out. Okay, my mantle

2960
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:53,740
allows me to jump. My jump distance is tripled.
Does that mean I could successfully back up and

2961
03:08:53,740 --> 03:08:57,365
jump off the tower and potentially land safely?

2962
03:08:57,365 --> 03:08:59,317
MATT: Land safely?

2963
03:08:59,317 --> 03:09:05,614
MARISHA: How about this? I'm going to go, sorry,
Grog! And turn and run, and I'm going to do a

2964
03:09:05,614 --> 03:09:10,358
full-on ninja-style jump and see if I can land on
top of this roof?

2965
03:09:10,358 --> 03:09:11,907
MATT: Okay.

2966
03:09:11,907 --> 03:09:13,751
MARISHA: Parkour.

2967
03:09:13,751 --> 03:09:16,875
MATT: Both you and your buddy get an attack of
opportunity on her.

2968
03:09:16,875 --> 03:09:25,462
TRAVIS: Reckless, for me. Buddy, first. That's a
23 to hit.

2969
03:09:25,462 --> 03:09:26,659
MARISHA: Yeah.

2970
03:09:26,659 --> 03:09:28,117
MATT: 2d6 plus three.

2971
03:09:28,117 --> 03:09:36,626
TRAVIS: Six.

2972
03:09:36,626 --> 03:09:38,762
MATT: Six points of damage to you.

2973
03:09:38,762 --> 03:09:50,001
MARISHA: Just six? Six from the knight. Okay, that
puts me at 46.

2974
03:09:50,001 --> 03:09:52,116
TRAVIS: 28 to hit from me.

2975
03:09:52,116 --> 03:09:54,076
SAM: That hits.

2976
03:09:54,076 --> 03:10:00,298
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

2977
03:10:00,298 --> 03:10:01,826
SAM: She's okay.

2978
03:10:01,826 --> 03:10:05,674
MATT: Keyleth, you turn, you run. Make an
athletics check, please.

2979
03:10:05,674 --> 03:10:09,212
MARISHA: Do I have advantage on this?

2980
03:10:09,212 --> 03:10:10,639
MATT: No.

2981
03:10:10,639 --> 03:10:15,825
MARISHA: I'm so bad at my athletics. I'm always
so bad! 12.

2982
03:10:15,825 --> 03:10:19,615
MATT: It's okay. You didn't have to roll high.
You'll get a decent distance, but your jump

2983
03:10:19,640 --> 03:10:24,402
distance is tripled because of your mantle, so you
do manage to make it and land on that roof. You

2984
03:10:24,402 --> 03:10:32,676
take four points of bludgeoning damage. I rolled
one, one, two.

2985
03:10:32,676 --> 03:10:34,825
MARISHA: Ugh, I fucking twisted my ankle.

2986
03:10:34,825 --> 03:10:37,074
MATT: Yeah, it hurt. It pops a little bit, but
you're there.

2987
03:10:37,074 --> 03:10:40,429
MARISHA: How much? Four points?

2988
03:10:40,429 --> 03:10:54,167
MATT: Four points, yeah. All right. That's your
turn, Keyleth? Taryon. You're way over here.

2989
03:10:54,167 --> 03:11:04,481
SAM: Fly out, fly up. Halfway up.

2990
03:11:04,481 --> 03:11:06,986
MATT: Halfway up? About there.

2991
03:11:06,986 --> 03:11:09,679
SAM: How does a cone work?

2992
03:11:09,679 --> 03:11:12,429
MATT: Cone? It's a cone outward.

2993
03:11:12,429 --> 03:11:18,924
SAM: We're dealing with three dimensions, here.

2994
03:11:18,924 --> 03:11:22,378
MATT: You could hit both of them. All three of
them with it.

2995
03:11:22,378 --> 03:11:24,477
SAM: I will aim that way.

2996
03:11:24,477 --> 03:11:29,172
MATT: You have to pull back a lot, like over
here.

2997
03:11:29,172 --> 03:11:31,266
MARISHA: What the fuck kind of cone are you
using?

2998
03:11:31,266 --> 03:11:33,730
SAM: I have many Prismatic Sprays.

2999
03:11:33,730 --> 03:11:37,519
MARISHA: Even though I'm down from them?

3000
03:11:37,519 --> 03:11:44,679
SAM: It's a 60-feet distance, 60-foot cone. I
don't know if the math is going to work. If not, I

3001
03:11:44,679 --> 03:11:46,416
have a backup plan.

3002
03:11:46,416 --> 03:11:48,549
MATT: Yeah, they're all within 60 feet.

3003
03:11:48,549 --> 03:11:50,092
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3004
03:11:50,092 --> 03:11:52,264
MARISHA: Tary wins.

3005
03:11:52,264 --> 03:11:55,731
SAM: d8 again?

3006
03:11:55,731 --> 03:11:59,127
MATT: Prismatic Spray. Yeah, d8.

3007
03:11:59,127 --> 03:12:02,307
SAM: This is a different one. This is a five.

3008
03:12:02,307 --> 03:12:15,710
MATT: Five. That's cold damage. I need Grog,
Keyleth. Your knight friend is (ice cracking)

3009
03:12:15,710 --> 03:12:20,711
frozen into place and is now a frozen statue of
ice, there, up in the tower.

3010
03:12:20,711 --> 03:12:21,974
MARISHA: Dexterity saves?

3011
03:12:21,974 --> 03:12:24,179
MATT: Dexterity saving throw, yeah.

3012
03:12:24,179 --> 03:12:25,999
MARISHA: Oh, that's good!

3013
03:12:25,999 --> 03:12:30,624
TRAVIS: Six, but I have resistance to cold.

3014
03:12:30,624 --> 03:12:34,723
MARISHA: I am at 20.

3015
03:12:34,723 --> 03:12:39,341
MATT: Yeah, you succeed. So half damage to both of
you. Roll that now. It's 10d6 cold damage.

3016
03:12:39,341 --> 03:12:41,664
TRAVIS: Ten cubes.

3017
03:12:41,664 --> 03:12:49,296
MARISHA: That saving throw may be the only thing
that saves me. Maybe. Depends on how he rolls.

3018
03:12:49,296 --> 03:12:52,983
MATT: Yeah, we'll see how the roll goes. This is
close.

3019
03:12:53,158 --> 03:12:57,024
TALIESIN: Ooh. Oh. Yeah.

3020
03:12:57,024 --> 03:13:05,268
SAM: 36, halved. 18.

3021
03:13:05,268 --> 03:13:08,210
MARISHA: I'm good!

3022
03:13:08,210 --> 03:13:11,493
TRAVIS: She says, before she dies.

3023
03:13:11,493 --> 03:13:13,601
MARISHA: Shut your dirty mouth.

3024
03:13:13,601 --> 03:13:27,059
SAM: Yeah. I'm flying. That negated my Sanctuary.
I'll do one more Sanctuary, and I'm going to stay

3025
03:13:27,059 --> 03:13:32,915
up. Can I fly back down? That probably took all my
speed. Yeah, I'll hover in place.

3026
03:13:32,915 --> 03:13:41,662
MATT: Top of the round. The towers surge,
bursting with energy up here and up here. Grog, I

3027
03:13:41,662 --> 03:13:46,153
need you to roll another dexterity saving throw.

3028
03:13:46,153 --> 03:13:47,856
TRAVIS: 18.

3029
03:13:47,856 --> 03:13:52,255
MATT: 18? Okay, that just succeeds. You take half
damage.

3030
03:13:52,255 --> 03:13:55,211
TRAVIS: And I have resistance.

3031
03:13:55,211 --> 03:14:01,189
MATT: Right. I rolled pretty good, so it was 21
points of lightning damage, reduced to ten, and

3032
03:14:01,189 --> 03:14:03,429
then halved because you have resistance, so five.

3033
03:14:03,429 --> 03:14:04,856
TRAVIS: Okay.

3034
03:14:04,856 --> 03:14:14,353
MATT: And Grog, it's your turn. You have Keyleth
over here.

3035
03:14:14,353 --> 03:14:26,599
TRAVIS: Oh, I only have one target. I stride
confidently to the edge of the tower, and I'd like

3036
03:14:26,599 --> 03:14:34,028
to use my Boots of Feral Leaping to jump and bring
my hammer down on top of Keyleth,

3037
03:14:34,028 --> 03:14:36,256
on top of the tower.

3038
03:14:36,256 --> 03:14:39,632
MATT: Go ahead and roll your athletics check.
Don't be a one.

3039
03:14:39,632 --> 03:14:44,412
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, don't be a one. That's pretty
good. That's a 22.

3040
03:14:44,412 --> 03:14:55,674
MATT: Okay. You leap and land. You do take three
points of bludgeoning damage.

3041
03:14:55,674 --> 03:14:57,443
Six, reduced to three.

3042
03:14:57,443 --> 03:15:01,811
MARISHA: Goddamn it, he was so close. I had him.
Twice!

3043
03:15:01,811 --> 03:15:03,164
MATT: I know.

3044
03:15:03,164 --> 03:15:05,416
MARISHA: I had you twice!

3045
03:15:05,416 --> 03:15:08,404
TRAVIS: Reckless, I smash.

3046
03:15:08,404 --> 03:15:10,306
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3047
03:15:10,306 --> 03:15:15,013
MARISHA: Time for a beautiful and glorious death.

3048
03:15:15,013 --> 03:15:17,928
LAURA: He got another 20!

3049
03:15:17,928 --> 03:15:20,659
MATT: On the first hit? Go ahead and roll damage.

3050
03:15:20,659 --> 03:15:23,882
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3051
03:15:23,882 --> 03:15:27,333
TRAVIS: That's a nine, so 18.

3052
03:15:27,333 --> 03:15:29,572
MARISHA: I almost teleported his fucking ass.

3053
03:15:29,572 --> 03:15:31,062
MATT: I know.

3054
03:15:31,062 --> 03:15:33,611
TALIESIN: There's six places he should have died.

3055
03:15:33,611 --> 03:15:35,360
TRAVIS: 34.

3056
03:15:35,360 --> 03:15:37,065
MARISHA: I'm unconscious.

3057
03:15:37,065 --> 03:15:45,598
TRAVIS: Let's not rush it. 43. 51.

3058
03:15:45,598 --> 03:15:52,623
MATT: So Keyleth-- you take the three damage not
from the stone breaking your fall, but from her

3059
03:15:52,693 --> 03:15:58,209
breaking your fall as you land on her. She (thud)
onto the stone, flat on the ground, the hammer

3060
03:15:58,209 --> 03:16:02,215
placed squarely between the back of her
shoulderblades, in the middle of the neck. As you

3061
03:16:02,215 --> 03:16:06,883
bring the hammer back up, pulling it back,
she's twitching a little on the stonework, but

3062
03:16:06,883 --> 03:16:08,810
she's still alive.

3063
03:16:08,810 --> 03:16:21,973
TRAVIS: I reach down. I grab one of those
jacked-up antlers, hold her up in the air. I look

3064
03:16:21,973 --> 03:16:31,377
at Tary, and I lob it and smack her towards the
acid pool. I want to hit her in the air towards

3065
03:16:31,377 --> 03:16:32,651
the acid pool.

3066
03:16:32,651 --> 03:16:34,481
MATT: Roll an attack.

3067
03:16:34,481 --> 03:16:38,004
MARISHA: (laughing) So cold!

3068
03:16:38,004 --> 03:16:40,962
TRAVIS: Jesus. Yeah, 36?

3069
03:16:40,962 --> 03:16:44,275
MATT: Yeah. It's an auto-crit, so it's two
automatic fails of your death saving throw.

3070
03:16:44,275 --> 03:16:47,724
(splash) Make a strength check.

3071
03:16:47,724 --> 03:16:49,056
MARISHA: Look.

3072
03:16:49,056 --> 03:16:52,189
TALIESIN: Oh, that's depressing.

3073
03:16:52,189 --> 03:16:53,480
MARISHA: Strength check.

3074
03:16:53,480 --> 03:16:57,975
MATT: He's making it, not you. You're making it.
What did you get?

3075
03:16:57,975 --> 03:17:00,699
TRAVIS: That is 12 plus eight. 20.

3076
03:17:00,699 --> 03:17:09,289
MATT: 20. You arc her, (whoosh, sizzle) taking the
final death saving throw as you slowly dissolve in

3077
03:17:09,289 --> 03:17:13,640
the acid. Keyleth eliminated from the battle.

3078
03:17:13,640 --> 03:17:16,358
MARISHA: I got to use the tattoo.

3079
03:17:16,358 --> 03:17:24,748
TRAVIS: One last attack. I look up at Tary and I'm
like, you did save me. What do you want to do?

3080
03:17:24,748 --> 03:17:34,971
SAM: I crack my knuckles. Come on, little man.
Let's rumble.

3081
03:17:34,971 --> 03:17:42,910
TRAVIS: I like your style. I have a throwing
distance. It is ranged, so I think it's at

3082
03:17:42,910 --> 03:17:45,721
disadvantage, which is 70 feet.

3083
03:17:45,721 --> 03:17:49,163
MATT: 70 feet? You can hit him at 70 feet, yeah.
It's disadvantage on the attack, though.

3084
03:17:49,163 --> 03:17:50,923
TRAVIS: So a regular roll, reckless.

3085
03:17:50,923 --> 03:17:54,739
MATT: Right. Well, first make a wisdom saving
throw, because he has Sanctuary.

3086
03:17:54,739 --> 03:17:58,204
TRAVIS: That's right.

3087
03:17:58,204 --> 03:18:00,813
LAURA: What did you get?

3088
03:18:00,813 --> 03:18:02,151
TRAVIS: An eight.

3089
03:18:02,151 --> 03:18:04,112
MATT: You go--

3090
03:18:04,112 --> 03:18:15,931
TRAVIS: Nah. I'll let you go first. With my speed,
can I run on this side

3091
03:18:15,931 --> 03:18:18,165
of the structure to get cover?

3092
03:18:18,165 --> 03:18:19,501
MATT: Here?

3093
03:18:19,501 --> 03:18:24,659
TRAVIS: Yep. Down. Whatever blocks his line of
sight from me.

3094
03:18:24,659 --> 03:18:27,127
MATT: Okay. Your turn, Taryon.

3095
03:18:27,127 --> 03:18:32,719
SAM: I'm flying, so I will fly where I saw him
hide.

3096
03:18:32,719 --> 03:18:35,568
MATT: You see him. He's not really hiding.
(laughs)

3097
03:18:35,568 --> 03:18:45,079
SAM: He's immune to everything, right?

3098
03:18:45,079 --> 03:18:46,830
LAURA: No, he's just resistant.

3099
03:18:46,830 --> 03:18:48,524
SAM: But he's resistant to everything.

3100
03:18:48,524 --> 03:18:52,363
MATT: He's resistant to slashing, bludgeoning,
piercing, fire, cold, and lightning right now.

3101
03:18:52,363 --> 03:18:55,381
LAURA: So poison, acid he's not resistant to.

3102
03:18:55,381 --> 03:18:56,910
TRAVIS: I'm resistant to poison.

3103
03:18:56,910 --> 03:18:58,567
LAURA: Oh, he's not resistant to acid.

3104
03:18:58,567 --> 03:19:00,461
MATT: Yeah, because of your belt.

3105
03:19:00,461 --> 03:19:10,112
SAM: I'll fly over there and I guess I've got to
get within 30 feet above him. Or 30 feet of him.

3106
03:19:10,112 --> 03:19:17,756
MATT: You can get about there. A little closer,
actually. You'd have to get to about there and you

3107
03:19:17,756 --> 03:19:19,258
can throw to him.

3108
03:19:19,258 --> 03:19:22,895
SAM: I'll chuck acid at him.

3109
03:19:22,895 --> 03:19:31,165
MATT: This vial (splash) hits the ground and
splashes acid all around you. He has to make a

3110
03:19:31,165 --> 03:19:32,827
dexterity saving throw, I think?

3111
03:19:32,827 --> 03:19:34,448
SAM: I'll look.

3112
03:19:34,448 --> 03:19:36,952
TRAVIS: Really? Already?

3113
03:19:36,952 --> 03:19:41,800
SAM: Dexterity saving throw.

3114
03:19:41,800 --> 03:19:47,681
TRAVIS: 18 is the first one. 18 on the second
one.

3115
03:19:47,681 --> 03:19:50,339
MATT: The DC, I'm pretty sure 18 makes it.

3116
03:19:50,339 --> 03:19:51,973
SAM: Yeah, so that's halved?

3117
03:19:51,973 --> 03:19:56,335
TRAVIS: Danger sense.

3118
03:19:56,335 --> 03:19:58,628
SAM: It's 9d6.

3119
03:19:58,628 --> 03:20:02,141
TALIESIN: Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

3120
03:20:02,141 --> 03:20:10,825
MARISHA: If Tary wins, I'm going to be so happy,
even though dirty fucking camper. Dirty camper.

3121
03:20:10,825 --> 03:20:12,527
MATT: No, that's a tactic.

3122
03:20:12,527 --> 03:20:16,456
SAM: 16. Wow, lousy. It was all ones and twos.

3123
03:20:16,456 --> 03:20:19,053
TRAVIS: 16 reduced to eight?

3124
03:20:19,053 --> 03:20:21,558
MATT: You take eight points of acid damage, Grog.

3125
03:20:21,558 --> 03:20:28,473
SAM: Oh, I attacked again, didn't I? Shit. I will
do another Sanctuary at level two.

3126
03:20:28,473 --> 03:20:32,732
MATT: All righty. Grog, it's your turn.

3127
03:20:32,732 --> 03:20:39,395
SAM: (singing) I'm like a bird.

3128
03:20:39,395 --> 03:20:51,659
TRAVIS: I climb back up on the roof. I walk over
to Tary. How did I break the Sanctuary with Groon?

3129
03:20:51,659 --> 03:20:56,881
I just booped him, right? Can I reach him with my
fingertip?

3130
03:20:56,881 --> 03:20:59,851
MATT: Nope. He's about 15 feet ahead of you.

3131
03:20:59,851 --> 03:21:01,647
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and hit him.

3132
03:21:01,647 --> 03:21:04,648
SAM: Jump and hit or throw and hit?

3133
03:21:04,648 --> 03:21:06,192
TRAVIS: Throw and hit.

3134
03:21:06,192 --> 03:21:08,103
MATT: So wisdom.

3135
03:21:08,103 --> 03:21:10,029
TRAVIS: No. 13.

3136
03:21:10,029 --> 03:21:12,176
MATT: So you go (frustrated noise).

3137
03:21:12,176 --> 03:21:16,884
TRAVIS: Stubborn as a mule. 11.

3138
03:21:16,884 --> 03:21:21,242
SAM: I'm doing that pec thing that you always do,
but I can't do it, so it looks like this.

3139
03:21:21,242 --> 03:21:24,092
(laughter)

3140
03:21:24,092 --> 03:21:30,325
TRAVIS: One more. Ooh! 19?

3141
03:21:30,325 --> 03:21:37,667
SAM: Sure, yeah. That means it breaks my
Sanctuary, yeah. Does he roll again to attack?

3142
03:21:37,667 --> 03:21:39,774
MATT: You have to roll to attack.

3143
03:21:39,774 --> 03:21:46,150
TRAVIS: Reckless. I got through, ma! 31.

3144
03:21:46,150 --> 03:21:47,319
SAM: Oh yeah.

3145
03:21:47,319 --> 03:21:49,165
MATT: Roll damage on that.

3146
03:21:49,165 --> 03:21:50,286
TRAVIS: 26.

3147
03:21:50,286 --> 03:21:51,489
SAM: Okay.

3148
03:21:51,489 --> 03:21:59,535
MATT: You're like, (laughs, gong sound). You taste
the blood for the

3149
03:21:59,535 --> 03:22:01,813
first time in your mouth, really.

3150
03:22:01,813 --> 03:22:03,535
TALIESIN: Does he stay on the broom?

3151
03:22:03,535 --> 03:22:04,778
MATT: Yeah.

3152
03:22:04,778 --> 03:22:06,331
LAURA: Had to bring him back, didn't you?

3153
03:22:06,331 --> 03:22:08,521
MARISHA: This is your fault.

3154
03:22:08,521 --> 03:22:10,133
SAM: Sorry.

3155
03:22:10,133 --> 03:22:16,288
TRAVIS: With the rest of my movement, can I run
back down off the roof and into the room?

3156
03:22:16,288 --> 03:22:30,029
MATT: Going off the roof there and then get
inside. So you'll be about there. You're low.

3157
03:22:30,029 --> 03:22:36,219
You're hunched in there. Melee attacks inside that
room for you right now are going to be at

3158
03:22:36,219 --> 03:22:41,207
disadvantage because the space is so crowded.
Taryon, your turn.

3159
03:22:41,207 --> 03:22:57,232
SAM: I'm going to actually fly away further and
pull out another gem from my helmet and cast what

3160
03:22:57,232 --> 03:23:12,549
modern-day people would call napalm. Straight into
the door. A Wall of Fire, straight in the door, in

3161
03:23:12,549 --> 03:23:15,376
the room.

3162
03:23:15,376 --> 03:23:21,010
TRAVIS: I ain't winning any beauty contests.

3163
03:23:21,010 --> 03:23:24,129
MATT: A straight wall of flame engulfs the room.

3164
03:23:24,129 --> 03:23:26,524
TRAVIS: (screams)

3165
03:23:26,524 --> 03:23:30,313
SAM: It's 5d8 fire damage.

3166
03:23:30,313 --> 03:23:34,444
TRAVIS: Ones and twos. Here we go!

3167
03:23:34,444 --> 03:23:37,076
SAM: But you're resistant, right?

3168
03:23:37,076 --> 03:23:37,784
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3169
03:23:37,784 --> 03:23:39,083
SAM: Okay.

3170
03:23:39,083 --> 03:23:44,199
TRAVIS: I've been burned, melted, burned, melted,
and burned.

3171
03:23:44,199 --> 03:23:51,289
MATT: Dexterity save from you, Grog.

3172
03:23:51,289 --> 03:24:01,416
TRAVIS: Dexterity? 21. Plus two on a 19.

3173
03:24:01,416 --> 03:24:03,074
SAM: 26.

3174
03:24:03,074 --> 03:24:08,408
MATT: 26, so you take half that, which is 13,
because you succeeded on your save, and then half

3175
03:24:08,408 --> 03:24:12,566
that. You take six points of fire damage.

3176
03:24:12,566 --> 03:24:14,304
SAM: That's it? Weak.

3177
03:24:14,304 --> 03:24:16,323
MATT: He's resistant to fire, man.

3178
03:24:16,323 --> 03:24:18,418
SAM: Okay.

3179
03:24:18,418 --> 03:24:24,852
MATT: That's your turn? You still have your bonus
action.

3180
03:24:24,852 --> 03:24:28,194
SAM: I'll Sanctuary myself again.

3181
03:24:28,194 --> 03:24:30,734
MATT: (laughs) All right.

3182
03:24:30,734 --> 03:24:39,826
TRAVIS: Damn it. Sanctuary!

3183
03:24:39,826 --> 03:24:41,478
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

3184
03:24:41,478 --> 03:24:44,276
TRAVIS: How far above the roof of that building is
he?

3185
03:24:44,276 --> 03:24:46,300
MATT: He's 30 feet above it.

3186
03:24:46,300 --> 03:24:51,197
TRAVIS: Okay, never mind. I will leap horizontally
towards the building that

3187
03:24:51,197 --> 03:24:53,350
he is close to. 20 feet.

3188
03:24:53,350 --> 03:24:56,625
MATT: You have to move out of the room first. So
you have ten feet out.

3189
03:24:56,625 --> 03:25:06,711
TRAVIS: I might not have made that. 17. I made it
by one.

3190
03:25:06,711 --> 03:25:10,899
MARISHA: Oh, you almost tripped in the acid? That
would have been awesome.

3191
03:25:10,899 --> 03:25:12,346
MATT: That would have been great.

3192
03:25:12,346 --> 03:25:13,893
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I fall prone.

3193
03:25:13,893 --> 03:25:16,599
MARISHA: Damn. It would have been so cool.

3194
03:25:16,599 --> 03:25:23,353
TRAVIS: So 20 feet horizontally, and then the rest
of my speed to run to the building, climb up on

3195
03:25:23,353 --> 03:25:30,375
the roof, and get right underneath him. I'd like
to try and get through this fucking Sanctuary.

3196
03:25:30,375 --> 03:25:31,562
MATT: Wisdom save.

3197
03:25:31,562 --> 03:25:33,327
LAURA: I like that we thought this might go fast.

3198
03:25:33,327 --> 03:25:36,489
MARISHA: I know. I'm still laughing at him saying
that at the top.

3199
03:25:36,489 --> 03:25:38,916
TRAVIS: 14.

3200
03:25:38,916 --> 03:25:40,635
MATT: Second attack lost.

3201
03:25:40,635 --> 03:25:43,493
TRAVIS: 19.

3202
03:25:43,493 --> 03:25:44,904
SAM: Oh yeah. That gets through.

3203
03:25:44,904 --> 03:25:50,083
MATT: Third and final strike. (grunts)

3204
03:25:50,083 --> 03:25:53,674
TRAVIS: 31.

3205
03:25:53,674 --> 03:25:55,523
MATT: 31 points of damage.

3206
03:25:55,523 --> 03:25:57,329
TRAVIS: No, just to hit.

3207
03:25:57,329 --> 03:25:58,697
MATT: Oh, to hit? Okay.

3208
03:25:58,697 --> 03:26:01,661
TRAVIS: Ten, 26.

3209
03:26:01,661 --> 03:26:03,086
MATT: 26 points of damage.

3210
03:26:03,086 --> 03:26:04,824
SAM: Okay. Still kicking.

3211
03:26:04,824 --> 03:26:07,458
TALIESIN: Quite well, I might add.

3212
03:26:07,458 --> 03:26:10,049
LAURA: He's got a lot. He had a lot of hit
points.

3213
03:26:10,049 --> 03:26:10,828
TRAVIS: Who?

3214
03:26:10,828 --> 03:26:11,608
LAURA: Tary.

3215
03:26:11,608 --> 03:26:15,168
TRAVIS: Oh, really? He ate half of his cloak or
whatever.

3216
03:26:15,168 --> 03:26:17,095
SAM: This guy is impossible to kill.

3217
03:26:17,095 --> 03:26:21,365
LAURA: Not impossible, Tary. It's not impossible.

3218
03:26:21,365 --> 03:26:23,092
MATT: All right. Tary, it's your turn.

3219
03:26:23,092 --> 03:26:30,586
SAM: Yeah.

3220
03:26:30,586 --> 03:26:37,812
MARISHA: 19. That 19 will haunt me for forever.

3221
03:26:37,812 --> 03:26:53,776
SAM: Is pulling a patch an action? I'll fly right
over the acid pit, right over the center, and I've

3222
03:26:53,776 --> 03:26:56,595
got to do one more Prismatic Spray.

3223
03:26:56,595 --> 03:27:00,727
MATT: All righty. Dexterity check, Grog. Roll a
d8.

3224
03:27:00,727 --> 03:27:02,592
TRAVIS: A d8?

3225
03:27:02,592 --> 03:27:04,613
MATT: He rolls a d8. What did you roll?

3226
03:27:04,613 --> 03:27:07,308
TRAVIS: 19?

3227
03:27:07,308 --> 03:27:10,781
SAM: It's four. It's poison, right?

3228
03:27:10,781 --> 03:27:12,173
MATT: Four is poison, yeah.

3229
03:27:12,173 --> 03:27:13,914
TRAVIS: Which I have resistance to.

3230
03:27:13,914 --> 03:27:17,745
MATT: Yeah, so roll 10d6. And he saved, so he
takes a quarter of the poison damage.

3231
03:27:17,745 --> 03:27:22,961
SAM: Wait, a quarter?! Goddamn it! This guy!

3232
03:27:22,961 --> 03:27:29,982
TRAVIS: Tary, at any time, you can just plop into
the acid and it will all be over. You can drop in,

3233
03:27:29,982 --> 03:27:41,238
listen to the bubbles consume your flesh. Be like
soggy Cracklin' Oat Bran. That milk looks weird.

3234
03:27:41,238 --> 03:27:45,670
SAM: 42 halved and quartered. So it's 11? Wait, is
that right?

3235
03:27:45,670 --> 03:27:46,963
TRAVIS: 21.

3236
03:27:46,963 --> 03:27:49,698
MATT: 21, ten. Ten points of poison damage.

3237
03:27:49,698 --> 03:27:51,740
SAM: Ten? Ten?!

3238
03:27:51,740 --> 03:27:54,734
MATT: He can't have that much more. Don't give
up.

3239
03:27:54,734 --> 03:27:56,944
TRAVIS: Let me guess. Sanctuary?

3240
03:27:56,944 --> 03:28:00,355
SAM: Oh yeah. That's a good idea!

3241
03:28:00,355 --> 03:28:02,189
(laughter)

3242
03:28:02,189 --> 03:28:03,979
SAM: I don't have many more of those.

3243
03:28:03,979 --> 03:28:06,306
MATT: All righty. Grog, it's your turn.

3244
03:28:06,306 --> 03:28:07,954
SAM: 3rd-level Sanctuary.

3245
03:28:07,954 --> 03:28:13,160
TRAVIS: I fucking walk off the roof and toward the
edge of the acid and I'm like, okay,

3246
03:28:13,160 --> 03:28:14,889
in range, and I'll--

3247
03:28:14,889 --> 03:28:18,883
LAURA: Wait, you can't cast 3rd-level spells after
you've already done a spell. You can only do

3248
03:28:18,883 --> 03:28:20,132
2nd-level.

3249
03:28:20,132 --> 03:28:23,158
SAM: Is the Prismatic Spray a spell?

3250
03:28:23,158 --> 03:28:27,373
MATT: It's not casting it at a higher level. He's
sacrificing a higher-level spell slot to cast a

3251
03:28:27,373 --> 03:28:29,580
lower-level. It doesn't change anything about it.

3252
03:28:29,580 --> 03:28:36,430
SAM: No, but because I used Prismatic Spray. Oh, I
see. It's still a low-level spell. I'm just using

3253
03:28:36,430 --> 03:28:37,414
a slot.

3254
03:28:37,414 --> 03:28:40,030
MATT: You're just using a higher-level slot. It's
not casting at a higher level.

3255
03:28:40,030 --> 03:28:45,037
MARISHA: Wait, what? All right. I just thought if
you cast it as a higher-level spell, you couldn't

3256
03:28:45,037 --> 03:28:46,859
do it as a lower-level spell?

3257
03:28:46,859 --> 03:28:48,407
SAM: Shenanigans.

3258
03:28:48,407 --> 03:28:52,681
MATT: He's basically sacrificing a high-level
spell to cast a lower-level spell that doesn't get

3259
03:28:52,681 --> 03:28:54,454
any benefit from being sacrificed.

3260
03:28:54,454 --> 03:29:00,998
TRAVIS: First wisdom save. Goddamn, the fucking--
17?

3261
03:29:00,998 --> 03:29:02,722
SAM: That's my DC.

3262
03:29:02,722 --> 03:29:04,589
MATT: First attack, you get through.

3263
03:29:04,589 --> 03:29:07,346
SAM: Where are you?

3264
03:29:07,346 --> 03:29:08,955
MATT: He moved right under here.

3265
03:29:08,955 --> 03:29:10,597
TALIESIN: He's right under you.

3266
03:29:10,597 --> 03:29:11,932
SAM: But I'm over the acid!

3267
03:29:11,932 --> 03:29:14,953
MARISHA: If you land in the acid, dude--

3268
03:29:14,953 --> 03:29:17,084
LAURA: If he knocks you off your broom?

3269
03:29:17,084 --> 03:29:19,612
TRAVIS: It's a 37 to hit.

3270
03:29:19,612 --> 03:29:24,060
LAURA: Did he get knocked off his broom? He
doesn't have the same things that I have.

3271
03:29:24,132 --> 03:29:28,343
TRAVIS: 24 on the first hit, for damage.

3272
03:29:28,343 --> 03:29:32,789
TALIESIN: I don't think we ever built a safety net
into his broom.

3273
03:29:32,789 --> 03:29:37,657
MATT: No, but he's not being knocked-- if it was
an attack that pushed or did anything to affect

3274
03:29:37,657 --> 03:29:41,111
his movement or yank him, then it would become an
issue. Just doing damage won't do anything.

3275
03:29:41,111 --> 03:29:46,663
TRAVIS: Oh, 26?

3276
03:29:46,663 --> 03:29:49,540
MATT: The same things that would knock him off the
broom would knock you off the broom. It would just

3277
03:29:49,540 --> 03:29:51,588
mean the broom stays attached to you.

3278
03:29:51,588 --> 03:30:02,750
TRAVIS: 22. Natural 19. Son of a bitch. A
million.

3279
03:30:02,750 --> 03:30:04,455
SAM: Sure.

3280
03:30:04,455 --> 03:30:07,161
MARISHA: I love that he's getting so cranky about
rolling natural 19s.

3281
03:30:07,263 --> 03:30:14,858
TRAVIS: 19 points of damage. I mean, after six
rolls, you'd hope so.

3282
03:30:14,858 --> 03:30:17,653
MATT: You made a save on each of those rolls?

3283
03:30:17,653 --> 03:30:22,139
TRAVIS: I am so sorry. I thought after I got
through the first one it just dispelled it.

3284
03:30:22,139 --> 03:30:23,582
MATT: Nope!

3285
03:30:23,582 --> 03:30:26,473
TRAVIS: The first one was a 24, I think?

3286
03:30:26,473 --> 03:30:27,538
MATT: Yes.

3287
03:30:27,538 --> 03:30:28,888
TRAVIS: So you need to erase--

3288
03:30:28,888 --> 03:30:30,901
MATT: Well, you have to roll saves for the next
two.

3289
03:30:30,901 --> 03:30:37,503
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. I probably won't get through
him, though. 15?

3290
03:30:37,503 --> 03:30:38,658
SAM: Nope.

3291
03:30:38,658 --> 03:30:39,831
TRAVIS: 15.

3292
03:30:39,831 --> 03:30:41,954
MATT: All right, so the last two attacks do no
damage.

3293
03:30:41,954 --> 03:30:44,724
SAM: I live to see another day.

3294
03:30:44,724 --> 03:30:47,281
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. I thought it dispelled it.

3295
03:30:47,281 --> 03:30:48,830
MARISHA: Or 15 more seconds.

3296
03:30:48,830 --> 03:30:56,249
SAM: Jesus Christ. I know that he takes acid
damage, right?

3297
03:30:56,249 --> 03:30:58,760
MATT: Yes. He doesn't appear to be resistant to
acid damage.

3298
03:30:58,760 --> 03:31:07,682
SAM: Okay, then I will throw acid at him. In
the face!

3299
03:31:07,682 --> 03:31:11,237
MATT: Two-Face style.

3300
03:31:11,237 --> 03:31:15,532
SAM: Yeah, the acid drop. It's a dex save.

3301
03:31:15,532 --> 03:31:18,180
MATT: It's a dex save on you, Grog, to try and
avoid it.

3302
03:31:18,180 --> 03:31:21,419
TRAVIS: 15?

3303
03:31:21,419 --> 03:31:23,441
MATT: What's your DC?

3304
03:31:23,441 --> 03:31:24,667
SAM: 17.

3305
03:31:24,667 --> 03:31:26,621
MATT: No. Full damage on this.

3306
03:31:26,621 --> 03:31:28,296
LAURA: Oh shit!

3307
03:31:28,296 --> 03:31:42,545
SAM: This could be it. Oh, this is it. Well,
maybe. 29.

3308
03:31:42,545 --> 03:31:46,292
TRAVIS: Oh, 29 points of damage?

3309
03:31:46,292 --> 03:31:50,516
MATT: Acid damage, yeah. Roll a constitution.

3310
03:31:50,516 --> 03:31:53,857
TRAVIS: With the plus two to constitution from the
card.

3311
03:31:53,857 --> 03:32:03,117
MATT: Well, plus one. The modifier gives you a
plus one. The DC is 15 this time.

3312
03:32:03,117 --> 03:32:04,388
TRAVIS: 24.

3313
03:32:04,388 --> 03:32:07,154
MATT: Okay. He stays up at one hit point.

3314
03:32:07,154 --> 03:32:09,347
SAM: (screams) He's insane!

3315
03:32:09,347 --> 03:32:11,668
MARISHA: He's undead!

3316
03:32:11,668 --> 03:32:16,805
MATT: The DC's going to be 20, next time that
happens. You still have your movement.

3317
03:32:16,805 --> 03:32:23,060
SAM: I'm going to go 50 feet anywhere. To the top
of that tower over there, I guess.

3318
03:32:23,060 --> 03:32:24,241
MATT: Over here?

3319
03:32:24,241 --> 03:32:30,254
SAM: Yeah. Can I get there? Or as far away from
him as I can get.

3320
03:32:30,254 --> 03:32:35,422
MATT: You can get... all the way over here.

3321
03:32:35,422 --> 03:32:38,076
SAM: I'm going to get lightninged, but that's
okay. I'll take it.

3322
03:32:38,076 --> 03:32:41,346
MATT: It's better than a Grogning. All right, that
ends your turn.

3323
03:32:41,346 --> 03:32:43,421
TRAVIS: You're on top of the fucking tower?

3324
03:32:43,421 --> 03:32:52,080
MATT: Top of the round, the braziers all
(explosion noise) in the distance. No effect.

3325
03:32:52,080 --> 03:32:53,546
Grog, your turn.

3326
03:32:53,546 --> 03:33:01,111
TRAVIS: May I leap over the acid pit with the
Boots of Feral Leaping, knowing I might fall in.

3327
03:33:01,111 --> 03:33:17,620
No, I'm in there. 23. Where are you going,
chicken? With my 50 feet of speed-- is there a

3328
03:33:17,620 --> 03:33:19,328
chain hanging from the front of it?

3329
03:33:19,328 --> 03:33:20,561
MATT: Yeah, right there.

3330
03:33:20,561 --> 03:33:22,688
TRAVIS: Can I climb that with 50 feet of speed?
Probably not.

3331
03:33:22,688 --> 03:33:25,197
MATT: You can climb it. We'll see how far you can
get.

3332
03:33:25,197 --> 03:33:31,430
TRAVIS: No. I'm going to run into the tower and
start running up the stairs.

3333
03:33:31,430 --> 03:33:39,375
MATT: You'll get partway into the first floor on
your 50. Are you going to dash

3334
03:33:39,375 --> 03:33:41,127
to try and do the rest?

3335
03:33:41,127 --> 03:33:43,001
TRAVIS: Yes, if it will get me to the top.

3336
03:33:43,001 --> 03:33:44,645
MATT: It won't get you all the way to the top,
no.

3337
03:33:44,645 --> 03:33:46,160
TRAVIS: Okay, that's fine. I'll dash.

3338
03:33:46,160 --> 03:33:53,339
MATT: Okay, you'll get-- with your dash, into the
third floor, almost to the hatch. So you're up in

3339
03:33:53,339 --> 03:33:55,778
the third floor right now. Tary?

3340
03:33:55,778 --> 03:34:01,398
SAM: (giggles) I casually walk down the stairs.

3341
03:34:01,398 --> 03:34:14,602
MATT: You come to the hatch, and Grog rushes up
into the third floor there. As you come down in

3342
03:34:14,602 --> 03:34:16,083
the hatch.

3343
03:34:16,083 --> 03:34:20,565
TRAVIS: I have a request. With your hands.
Please.

3344
03:34:20,565 --> 03:34:21,780
SAM: With my hands?

3345
03:34:21,780 --> 03:34:22,770
TRAVIS: Yes.

3346
03:34:22,770 --> 03:34:23,905
LAURA: Don't.

3347
03:34:23,905 --> 03:34:25,163
TRAVIS: I'm a simple man.

3348
03:34:25,163 --> 03:34:34,212
SAM: All right. I can do that. (laughing) I can't
do that. You're so powerful. I'll probably miss!

3349
03:34:34,212 --> 03:34:36,644
TRAVIS: You got it, man.

3350
03:34:36,644 --> 03:34:41,483
SAM: If I miss, then I'm trapped in a room with
him!

3351
03:34:41,483 --> 03:34:43,383
TRAVIS: I've got one hit point.

3352
03:34:43,383 --> 03:34:45,208
SAM: But I could miss.

3353
03:34:45,208 --> 03:34:47,196
LAURA: Kill him, Tary!

3354
03:34:47,196 --> 03:34:51,079
TRAVIS: This is your chance to claim your bravery
for your house.

3355
03:34:51,079 --> 03:34:52,385
SAM: Greatsword!

3356
03:34:52,385 --> 03:34:55,228
MARISHA: You're getting him with a greatsword?

3357
03:34:55,228 --> 03:34:58,187
SAM: That's what I've got. Greatsword.

3358
03:34:58,187 --> 03:35:00,774
MATT: Your rod turns into a greatsword.

3359
03:35:00,774 --> 03:35:03,428
TRAVIS: (laughing) The fucking thing.

3360
03:35:03,428 --> 03:35:11,985
SAM: I'll do this crazy around and around thing
and try to do that with the greatsword. Oh, and

3361
03:35:11,985 --> 03:35:14,230
can I set it on fire, first?

3362
03:35:14,230 --> 03:35:15,167
MATT: Yes, you can.

3363
03:35:15,167 --> 03:35:16,742
TRAVIS: Oh, good. Yeah.

3364
03:35:16,742 --> 03:35:26,126
SAM: What am I rolling? What was that? 12 plus
eight plus two magic. That's 22.

3365
03:35:26,126 --> 03:35:29,165
MATT: Hits. Roll damage.

3366
03:35:29,165 --> 03:35:32,024
SAM: Three.

3367
03:35:32,024 --> 03:35:35,469
MATT: Grog, make a constitution--

3368
03:35:35,469 --> 03:35:38,284
SAM: Oh, it's 2d6. Four.

3369
03:35:38,284 --> 03:35:41,237
(laughter)

3370
03:35:41,237 --> 03:35:48,523
MATT: Roll a constitution saving throw. DC 20.

3371
03:35:48,523 --> 03:35:50,688
TRAVIS: That's a natural 19.

3372
03:35:50,688 --> 03:35:52,730
MARISHA: Oh my god, he's still fucking alive!

3373
03:35:52,730 --> 03:35:54,189
SAM: What happened?!

3374
03:35:54,189 --> 03:35:55,593
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

3375
03:35:55,593 --> 03:35:57,182
SAM: (screams)

3376
03:35:57,182 --> 03:35:59,730
TRAVIS: And I'd like to take my retaliation
strike.

3377
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:01,038
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3378
03:36:01,038 --> 03:36:02,486
SAM: I still have movement.

3379
03:36:02,486 --> 03:36:06,481
MATT: You do, after this. Retaliation is an
immediate reaction.

3380
03:36:06,481 --> 03:36:20,233
SAM: I get a disengage. Didn't we go over this? I
did a melee weapon attack. Don't I get a disengage

3381
03:36:20,233 --> 03:36:21,336
for free?

3382
03:36:21,336 --> 03:36:25,480
MATT: As your feat, you mean?

3383
03:36:25,480 --> 03:36:27,873
SAM: Yes! My Mobile feat.

3384
03:36:27,873 --> 03:36:34,002
MATT: Right, but this isn't him getting a free
attack from you moving away. One of his barbarian

3385
03:36:34,002 --> 03:36:37,729
abilities is if someone hits him with a melee
attack, he can immediately attack.

3386
03:36:37,800 --> 03:36:39,168
SAM: Okay.

3387
03:36:39,168 --> 03:36:41,631
MATT: He goaded you right into doing what he
wanted.

3388
03:36:41,631 --> 03:36:43,212
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3389
03:36:43,212 --> 03:36:45,770
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

3390
03:36:45,770 --> 03:36:47,837
SAM: Enough.

3391
03:36:47,837 --> 03:36:49,322
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

3392
03:36:49,322 --> 03:36:50,669
MATT: Make your attack, Grog.

3393
03:36:50,669 --> 03:36:56,911
TRAVIS: Reckless. Come on, natural 20. No. 27.

3394
03:36:56,911 --> 03:36:58,974
SAM: To hit? Sure.

3395
03:36:58,974 --> 03:37:04,263
TRAVIS: 25 points of damage.

3396
03:37:04,263 --> 03:37:05,810
SAM: That hurts.

3397
03:37:05,810 --> 03:37:07,485
TRAVIS: But not enough.

3398
03:37:07,485 --> 03:37:14,728
SAM: It hurts you, because I have a Shield of Fire
that burns anybody who attacks me with a melee

3399
03:37:14,728 --> 03:37:19,720
attack. With 2d8 cold damage.

3400
03:37:19,720 --> 03:37:27,659
TRAVIS: This fucking magic is too much for this
barbarian. I mean, goddamn. People are turning

3401
03:37:27,659 --> 03:37:31,501
into flames, dragons, running around in a fucking
hamster ball,

3402
03:37:31,501 --> 03:37:34,619
setting me on fucking cold damage...

3403
03:37:34,619 --> 03:37:36,206
MATT: Roll some cold damage.

3404
03:37:36,206 --> 03:37:38,287
SAM: Two. Nine.

3405
03:37:38,287 --> 03:37:40,813
MATT: Make another constitution check with a DC
25, Grog.

3406
03:37:40,813 --> 03:37:42,551
MARISHA: DC 25!

3407
03:37:42,551 --> 03:37:51,071
LAURA: He has to roll a natural 20 in order to get
this. No. He has to roll a 19.

3408
03:37:51,071 --> 03:37:53,581
SAM: He gets two rolls.

3409
03:37:53,581 --> 03:37:58,573
TRAVIS: I have plus 12 as the modifier to the
roll. My constitution is plus 12.

3410
03:37:58,573 --> 03:38:02,030
LAURA: Oh, a saving throw? Oh shit.

3411
03:38:02,030 --> 03:38:05,147
TRAVIS: So I have to roll-- what's the math on
that?

3412
03:38:05,147 --> 03:38:06,478
MATT: It's a 25.

3413
03:38:06,478 --> 03:38:08,377
TRAVIS: 17 or higher?

3414
03:38:08,377 --> 03:38:10,853
LAURA: It's not even that much. It's a 13 or
higher.

3415
03:38:10,853 --> 03:38:15,505
MARISHA: He's going to make it.

3416
03:38:15,505 --> 03:38:18,233
TRAVIS: Seven.

3417
03:38:18,233 --> 03:38:20,981
MATT: Taryon, how do you want to do this?

3418
03:38:20,981 --> 03:38:31,694
SAM: I want him to hit the blazing TD on my chest
and have the might of my name ricochet back with

3419
03:38:31,694 --> 03:38:36,568
the power of energy. The Darrington name strikes
him down.

3420
03:38:36,568 --> 03:38:45,430
MATT: The cold shatters you, and you feel the
ribcage break like brittle glass on the inside of

3421
03:38:45,430 --> 03:38:50,784
your chest from the blast backward. You fall to
your knees, unable to move a muscle. You can feel

3422
03:38:50,784 --> 03:38:55,858
the life barely beating through. Your body is
heaving with each heartbeat pulse. He's prostrate

3423
03:38:55,858 --> 03:38:57,503
before you, Taryon, as you approach.

3424
03:38:57,503 --> 03:39:05,804
SAM: I say, Doty, take this down. I win. And I
kick him over.

3425
03:39:05,804 --> 03:39:12,978
MATT: As you hit the ground, as the last of the
cold damage has curled over your body and freezes

3426
03:39:12,978 --> 03:39:20,105
you solid, you (shattering) shatter into thousands
of small, frozen pieces. The last T2 reference of

3427
03:39:20,105 --> 03:39:31,697
the night, yep. As Taryon Darrington stands victor
of this round. As you stand there, breathing

3428
03:39:31,697 --> 03:39:38,062
heavily, suddenly the stone top of the tower
cracks open, like it's being pulled apart by giant,

3429
03:39:38,062 --> 03:39:45,632
invisible hands. And there you see, descending
from above, a gentleman in a large, dark cloak and

3430
03:39:45,632 --> 03:39:54,484
a magnificent beard, and a glorious, well-kept
mane of hair. He lands. "Let this blessing of

3431
03:39:54,484 --> 03:40:01,577
"Colville carry you into any dimension." He touches
your forehead and you feel the fates reach into

3432
03:40:01,577 --> 03:40:09,738
you and plant you with a seed of possibility. And
then with that, a flash is gone. You awaken in

3433
03:40:09,738 --> 03:40:16,852
your bed. Cold sweat. The next morning after you
went to sleep. You're not as powerful as you felt

3434
03:40:16,852 --> 03:40:23,970
before. That was a crazy dream. But you look down
and you see this slight glow of white light across

3435
03:40:23,970 --> 03:40:31,081
your sternum from underneath your silk pajamas,
and then it fades, and you feel like something

3436
03:40:31,081 --> 03:40:36,945
from that dream is holding on. And that's where
we're going to end our game tonight.

3437
03:40:36,945 --> 03:40:39,073
(cheering)

3438
03:40:39,073 --> 03:40:40,519
TRAVIS: You got your fate dice.

3439
03:40:40,519 --> 03:40:45,977
LAURA: Oh my god. And your parents are named after
Tony Stark's parents. How crazy is that?

3440
03:40:45,977 --> 03:40:47,736
SAM: Oh, wait. They are?

3441
03:40:47,736 --> 03:40:49,928
TRAVIS: How many hit points did you have left?

3442
03:40:49,928 --> 03:40:51,283
SAM: I still had 30 or something.

3443
03:40:51,283 --> 03:40:54,244
TALIESIN: He had 25.

3444
03:40:54,244 --> 03:40:59,083
MATT: I'm curious. Where were you going to try and
Plane Shift Grog?

3445
03:40:59,083 --> 03:41:02,690
MARISHA: Water Plane. Water dimension. You would
have just drowned.

3446
03:41:02,690 --> 03:41:04,230
TALIESIN: Solid.

3447
03:41:04,230 --> 03:41:09,743
MARISHA: I didn't know your charisma was-- I
thought you had zero.

3448
03:41:09,743 --> 03:41:11,492
TRAVIS: It's plus one.

3449
03:41:11,492 --> 03:41:17,532
MARISHA: All he had to roll was an 18 or lower.
Anything else.

3450
03:41:17,532 --> 03:41:21,102
TRAVIS: That's why I was like, ugh, it's a 19.

3451
03:41:21,102 --> 03:41:25,283
LAURA: Oh man. That was awesome.

3452
03:41:25,283 --> 03:41:26,784
MATT: That was a great battle, guys.

3453
03:41:26,784 --> 03:41:32,253
TRAVIS: That was a great map! That map was
amazing.

3454
03:41:32,253 --> 03:41:35,285
MATT: I'm glad you guys had fun. I was hoping it
would be fun.

3455
03:41:35,285 --> 03:41:38,467
TRAVIS: The three different varying--

3456
03:41:38,467 --> 03:41:41,095
SAM: It was like a paintball field.

3457
03:41:41,095 --> 03:41:45,895
MATT: That's what I wanted to make it feel like.
Little bunker areas.

3458
03:41:45,895 --> 03:41:49,573
LAURA: You did have places that people that were
flying could hide.

3459
03:41:49,573 --> 03:41:50,810
MATT: Yeah.

3460
03:41:50,810 --> 03:41:55,373
TRAVIS: If we had tried to hit one of the spires
that created electricity,

3461
03:41:55,373 --> 03:41:57,193
would that have ended that?

3462
03:41:57,193 --> 03:42:02,395
MATT: Here? You could have destroyed it. Hitting
it would have done damage to it, but it would have

3463
03:42:02,395 --> 03:42:04,585
prevented that from going off in that area.

3464
03:42:04,585 --> 03:42:06,490
SAM: Were all the trunks the same thing?

3465
03:42:06,490 --> 03:42:08,604
MATT: Yeah, each trunk had one healing potion. It
was whoever got there first.

3466
03:42:08,604 --> 03:42:10,011
TALIESIN: And there was one trunk left?

3467
03:42:10,011 --> 03:42:11,578
MATT: One trunk left that nobody went to.

3468
03:42:11,578 --> 03:42:12,425
TRAVIS: Which one?

3469
03:42:12,425 --> 03:42:14,631
MARISHA: The one that I was in for a lot of the
time.

3470
03:42:14,631 --> 03:42:16,313
TALIESIN: I kept thinking about telling you.

3471
03:42:16,313 --> 03:42:20,078
TRAVIS: Oh, really? The one down here in the lower
left?

3472
03:42:20,078 --> 03:42:21,362
TALIESIN: Yeah, bottom left.

3473
03:42:21,362 --> 03:42:23,430
MARISHA: It was the one I was camping out in.

3474
03:42:23,430 --> 03:42:25,833
TALIESIN: But it wasn't my turn, so I didn't say
anything.

3475
03:42:25,833 --> 03:42:30,203
MARISHA: I almost thought about taking it just so
no one else could have it, but never got to it.

3476
03:42:30,203 --> 03:42:31,609
MATT: Well done, guys.

3477
03:42:31,609 --> 03:42:34,532
TALIESIN: (giggles) That was nuts.

3478
03:42:34,532 --> 03:42:41,783
MATT: Oh man. Well, when this campaign arc's over
and we have everybody available, hopefully, we'll

3479
03:42:41,783 --> 03:42:47,325
probably have one final battle royale with
everyone max level, with Vax, with Pike, and see

3480
03:42:47,325 --> 03:42:52,366
who comes through on that one. And whatever gift
boon I decide for that one, if it's similar or the

3481
03:42:52,366 --> 03:42:55,263
same, will probably carry over to the next
campaign for their first new characters.

3482
03:42:55,263 --> 03:42:56,632
Should be fun.

3483
03:42:56,632 --> 03:43:00,465
MARISHA: Level 20 Keyleth is nasty. I get
unlimited Shapechange.

3484
03:43:00,465 --> 03:43:08,177
TRAVIS: What do you mean, is nasty? You are nasty!
You were like the fucking Conclave. Jesus. The

3485
03:43:08,177 --> 03:43:09,921
only thing you didn't turn into was a giant.

3486
03:43:09,921 --> 03:43:11,764
MARISHA: I thought I was going to take the light
down.

3487
03:43:11,764 --> 03:43:14,431
MATT: You had a 90% chance of just disappearing
and drowning.

3488
03:43:14,431 --> 03:43:20,026
MARISHA: Yeah. I thought that's what he was going
to fucking do. I can't believe that.

3489
03:43:20,026 --> 03:43:22,188
TRAVIS: That's true, yeah.

3490
03:43:22,188 --> 03:43:24,963
MARISHA: You would have bamfed, and then it would
have been down to Tary and I.

3491
03:43:24,963 --> 03:43:27,540
LAURA: I had no idea you could break out of my
fucking necklace!

3492
03:43:27,540 --> 03:43:29,493
MATT: Nobody tried.

3493
03:43:29,493 --> 03:43:34,019
TALIESIN: There's so many ways that you could have
died tonight.

3494
03:43:34,019 --> 03:43:36,377
MARISHA: Yeah, you could have died 80 times.

3495
03:43:36,377 --> 03:43:42,766
TALIESIN: If that glove had worked, I would have
had an action surge and five shots to the head.

3496
03:43:42,766 --> 03:43:47,445
MATT: It's the balance to the necklace so you
can't just imprison the main big bad guy of

3497
03:43:47,445 --> 03:43:52,278
something and be like, "Oh, that's over because he
rolled poor." It will help for a while, but if he

3498
03:43:52,278 --> 03:43:55,932
stays in there for a long time and he's
intelligent, he'll eventually find a way out. It's

3499
03:43:55,932 --> 03:43:57,416
an imperfect prison.

3500
03:43:57,416 --> 03:44:00,526
TALIESIN: It's a wicker basket.

3501
03:44:00,526 --> 03:44:03,192
TRAVIS: And the Deck, yet again, didn't harm me.

3502
03:44:03,192 --> 03:44:07,040
LAURA: Well, you don't know that because it was
all a dream in Tary's fucking head.

3503
03:44:07,040 --> 03:44:13,297
MARISHA: You pulling that knight probably changed
things because he did just enough damage to me to

3504
03:44:13,297 --> 03:44:14,680
make it a pain in the ass.

3505
03:44:14,680 --> 03:44:17,406
TALIESIN: That plus two to modifier? There's a
lot.

3506
03:44:17,406 --> 03:44:22,025
SAM: The cards were amazing!

3507
03:44:22,025 --> 03:44:26,602
MATT: I'm going to hold onto those, if that's
okay. I want to use those from now on. Oh, that

3508
03:44:26,602 --> 03:44:27,974
was so much fun.

3509
03:44:27,974 --> 03:44:29,689
TALIESIN: Came in the mail a little while ago.

3510
03:44:29,689 --> 03:44:33,692
TRAVIS: Taryon Darrington, champion of the battle
royale.

3511
03:44:33,692 --> 03:44:39,701
MATT: Two clerics and an artificer are our
reigning champions in the battles, guys.

3512
03:44:39,701 --> 03:44:40,818
MARISHA: Two clerics?

3513
03:44:40,818 --> 03:44:43,225
TRAVIS: Kashaw won the first.

3514
03:44:43,225 --> 03:44:44,525
MATT: Then Pike.

3515
03:44:44,525 --> 03:44:51,407
MARISHA: That's right, Kash. And I was the
runner-up with Pike, too! Goddamn it.

3516
03:44:51,407 --> 03:44:54,777
MATT: And then Pike pushed your face into lava.

3517
03:44:54,777 --> 03:44:56,614
MARISHA: I wasn't the runner-up tonight.

3518
03:44:56,614 --> 03:45:00,441
TALIESIN: I went down hard, man.

3519
03:45:00,441 --> 03:45:01,859
LAURA: You did go down hard.

3520
03:45:01,859 --> 03:45:03,068
MATT: Oh, Percy.

3521
03:45:03,068 --> 03:45:04,460
SAM: You got hammered to death so soon.

3522
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:09,610
TALIESIN: Again, if the glove had worked, it would
have been amazing. That would have been an ugly,

3523
03:45:09,610 --> 03:45:11,037
terrible death for Grog.

3524
03:45:11,037 --> 03:45:18,131
MATT: You had some bad rolls. You, more so than
anybody in this party-- maybe Grog, but Grog had

3525
03:45:18,131 --> 03:45:22,746
to still get there-- you, with an action surge and
some good rolls, you can pretty much take down

3526
03:45:22,746 --> 03:45:24,535
almost any member in one round.

3527
03:45:24,535 --> 03:45:25,778
TALIESIN: With good rolls.

3528
03:45:25,778 --> 03:45:26,773
MATT: With good rolls.

3529
03:45:26,773 --> 03:45:32,371
MARISHA: You jammed all of your guns. I can't
believe you jammed all of your guns.

3530
03:45:32,371 --> 03:45:36,298
TALIESIN: Not only that, but the gun that does
damage when it jams jammed twice.

3531
03:45:36,298 --> 03:45:38,000
LAURA: All of your war paint is gone.

3532
03:45:38,000 --> 03:45:39,952
MARISHA: How did you do that?

3533
03:45:39,952 --> 03:45:43,236
SAM: Oh my god, it's gone. Did you go wash your
face?

3534
03:45:43,236 --> 03:45:47,114
LAURA: No, he's just been wiping his face the
whole night. It's all over his hands, probably.

3535
03:45:47,114 --> 03:45:48,698
TALIESIN: Show us your hands.

3536
03:45:48,698 --> 03:45:49,965
LAURA: No, don't.

3537
03:45:49,965 --> 03:45:52,605
SAM: Your sheets tonight are going to be nasty.

3538
03:45:52,605 --> 03:45:54,823
TALIESIN: You're going to be hard to see in the
forest.

3539
03:45:54,823 --> 03:46:03,661
MATT: Well done, guys. Thank you guys for playing.
Hope you guys enjoyed watching. We'll see you guys

3540
03:46:03,661 --> 03:46:11,326
next week to pick up the next leg of the
adventure, as we left off right as you were

3541
03:46:11,326 --> 03:46:19,833
exiting the platinum mines with the swarm of
ankhegs below you. We'll pick up from there next

3542
03:46:19,833 --> 03:46:23,944
week. We'll have Jon Heder as a guest, which I
got to coordinate with him to get his story stuff

3543
03:46:23,944 --> 03:46:32,019
