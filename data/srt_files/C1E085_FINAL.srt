00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:04,655
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:07,985
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons--

3
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:09,389
ALL: (cheering)

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,407
MATT: -- you assholes.

5
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:12,655
MARISHA: Der 'n' Der!

6
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:17,010
MATT: Welcome. Tonight should be an interesting
episode, but, before we begin, let's go ahead and

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,959
get through our announcements for the evening! So,
welcome, and, first and foremost, tonight we are

8
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,864
sponsored by our friends at Loot Crate.

00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:26,209
ALL: (cheering) Loot Crate!

10
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,648
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate, for being amazing
sponsors.

11
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:30,206
Sam, did you want to tell us a little
about--

12
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,204
SAM: Okay! I haven't done this in a while,
so I'm falling back on

13
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:37,898
an old crutch, an old beloved character--

14
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:41,658
Rhodey Slater is back to do another round--

15
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,439
MATT: (laughing) Oh my god.

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,258
SAM: Gotta get in character.

17
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:47,846
(in surfer voice)
Yo-ho-ho, it's me, Rhodey Slater, with another

18
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:53,949
message from our sponsor, Loot Crate. Whether
you're dropping in on a party wave in Uluwatu or

19
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:59,623
even Tamarindo, you won't look like a paddle-puss
if you haul your tres gnarly gear from El Crate-o

20
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:05,856
del Loot-o. This month's theme is Build,
featuring sick brands like Power Rangers,

21
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:11,935
hang ten; Batman, wax it up; Lego, mondo
bitchin'; and Tetris, shaka.

22
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,568
(all laugh)

23
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:15,945
SAM: So don't get raked over
by a wiper, point your nose to

24
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:22,548
Lootcrate.com/CriticalRole and use promo code
"criticalrole" for 10% off your subscription.

25
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:29,303
You'll be radder than Tom Curren nailing a 360
air reverse rodeo. You'll be cooler than a tight

26
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:34,580
on-shore breeze at Malibu. You'll be more
authentic than a sad voice actor searching for

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,604
surfing terms on Yahoo Answers at 5 pm--

28
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:38,773
(all laugh)

29
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:42,683
SAM: -- when he should be really spending more
quality time with his children, as their youthful

30
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:49,672
lives pass by without their father, precious
moments ticking away until one day they're adults,

31
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:55,171
and you're standing at their wedding, thinking,
"Oh my god, I missed so much, I missed so very

32
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:59,915
much, and for what? A Loot Crate ad?"

33
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:02,174
Anyway, ride that tube and subscribe today,

34
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:03,881
(shouting) bonzai!

35
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:06,337
(all laugh and cheer)

36
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:11,490
TRAVIS: I mean, he's a whole new echelon.
It's a whole new--

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,890
TALIESIN: You just Inception'd a Loot Crate ad.

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,413
MATT: Thank you for that!

39
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:19,625
TRAVIS: Incredible!

40
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,488
MATT: Sam.

41
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:24,795
MARISHA: You took, like, a failed Californian
sketch and turned it into Oscar-winning material.

42
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,754
MATT: That is, thank you very much.

43
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:28,992
LAURA: It hurts, it hurts.

44
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,710
LIAM: I didn't know Rhodey's, Rhodey's a father,
that's an interesting development.

45
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,389
SAM: Yeah.

46
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:33,439
MATT: Indeed.

47
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,592
SAM: Many. Many.

48
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:36,619
MATT: Just a heads-up, guys, we've done a couple
of these and we're going to do a couple more of

49
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:40,173
these upcoming For Honor streams, where a few of
us are going to be guesting on here for a number

50
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:44,028
of hours to play For Honor and beat the shit out
of each other and other people, as various

51
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:49,471
historical warriors of old. And then a number of
us are actually, I think, a voice in the game.

52
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,041
TRAVIS: Yeah!

53
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:57,092
MATT: But yeah. So tomorrow, joining the Nerdist
team from 9 am to 12 noon Pacific Time, we have

54
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:58,382
Liam and Travis--

55
00:02:58,382 --> 00:02:58,951
TRAVIS: Woo!

56
00:02:58,951 --> 00:02:59,528
LIAM: Tarvis!

57
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:04,681
MATT: --to jump in on there, and then, on
Saturday, from 12 noon to 3 pm, that's going to be

58
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:08,258
Travis, Taliesin, Sam, Marisha, and myself on
there--

59
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:09,604

00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:12,356
TRAVIS: Yep.

63
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,422
LAURA: Why aren't I there?

64
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,326
TRAVIS: 'Cuz you suck.

65
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:15,053
LAURA: Oh man.

66
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:15,763
LIAM: He's right.

67
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,699
LAURA: I know it!

68
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,108
LIAM: He would know. He would know.

69
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:21,777
MATT: (laughs) So yeah, it'll be here on the
Twitch, check it out, I'm really excited,

70
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:24,740
I haven't played the game yet? And everyone I
know who's talked about has said it's ridiculously

71
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,841
fun and amazing. It's like, the upgrade of Dark
Souls combat and I'm really excited about it.

72
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,365
TRAVIS: I have to, like, show up an hour early and
learn how to play, or we're going to get.

73
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,037
We're going to get killed a lot.

74
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:36,669
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm probably going to.

75
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,297
TRAVIS: We've got to work on our death sounds.

76
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:40,844
LIAM: What, I'm Leet, man, you're going down,
and stuff.

77
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:41,802
TRAVIS: (belches)

78
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:42,671
LAURA: Leet!

79
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,158
MATT: (accented voice) Going down.

80
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,686
TRAVIS: No. No. You... are the one falling,
in the opposite direction of up.

81
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,327
LIAM: (in Christopher Walken voice) It's important
to point out, we're not doing Walken anymore--

82
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,440
(all laugh)

83
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,080
LIAM: --we're doing our impression of Troy,
doing an impression of Nolan doing Walken.

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,081
MATT: Oh, wow.

85
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:58,961
TRAVIS: It's a quad lay-up.

86
00:03:58,961 --> 00:03:59,628
MATT: The chain goes deep.

87
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:00,485
LAURA: Yeah, it does.

88
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:01,748
TRAVIS: (Walken voice) Quad. Lay-up.

89
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:02,849
LAURA: Woah. Just woah. (laughs)

90
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,144
LIAM: I don't even know what Walken sounds like,
it's come through a daisy-chain of assholes.

91
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:16,176
MATT: It's true, it's true. That's our next shirt.
"Daisy Chain of Assholes." I'm okay with that.

92
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:18,297
TRAVIS: Critical Role: It's About Scientology--

93
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:20,097
MATT: Also, don't google that phrase!

94
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,495
TRAVIS: -- and a Daisy Chain of Assholes.

95
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,037
MATT: All right! Next up, we have (quieter) me,
breaking my pen. Uh--

96
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:25,559
LAURA: Oh, no.

00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,434

102
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,322
SAM: We're allowed to say the date now?

103
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:37,957
MATT: We do now. That's all the information we
have so far, but April 1st, WonderCon. Critical

Role and Talks Machina live, in their--

105
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,534
LAURA: Be there or be squared!

106
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:42,687
MATT: -- big room, it's gonna be good.

107
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:43,423
TRAVIS: Anaheim.

108
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:44,581
MARISHA: Big room, did I say square?

109
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,959
SAM: It is not an epic April Fools' Joke--

110
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,523
MATT: No.

111
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:47,433
SAM: -- this is really happening.

112
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,146
TRAVIS: It's really happening.

113
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:49,381
TALIESIN: It's really happening.

114
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:49,865
SAM: Okay.

115
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:51,918
TRAVIS: And it's going to be a big, big,
rowdy room. So if you're like, "Aw, I don't want

116
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,972
to go, there's not going to be any seats." 
There gon' be seats.

117
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:55,620
MATT: There's plenty of seats.

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,295
LIAM: Yeah, it's--

119
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,403
TRAVIS: Bring it, if you can.

120
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:58,801
LIAM: --It's April Fools', we're not going to be
there.

121
00:04:58,801 --> 00:04:59,843
TRAVIS: I can say that.

122
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:00,740
SAM: You know what?

123
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,523
LIAM: We're not going to do that.

124
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:04,597
SAM: I will promise that I will play at least one
April Fools' joke

125
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:08,355
on one of you, during that panel.

126
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:08,981
LAURA: Ooh.

127
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,898
TALIESIN: I'm excited by this.

128
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,667
LAURA: Can I vote for Brian?

129
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:12,289
LIAM: I'm not.

130
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,348
SAM: Sure, of course.

131
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:14,340
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

132
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,722
TRAVIS: He's not listening to this right now.

133
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:18,298
MATT: We should have a poll in the community for
which member of the team Sam gets to prank.

134
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:19,585
(all laugh)

135
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,582
MATT: Don't actually do that, please. 'Cause we
all know that's going to be--

136
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,635
TALIESIN: I'm a big fan of Brian, I have a feeling
that's a good bet.

137
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:25,429
MATT: Also!

138
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:27,192
MARISHA: Man, we're being so transparent.

139
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,185
MATT: Isn't it, though? All right! Next up--

140
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,299
LIAM: Wow.

141
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,017
MATT: Signal Boost has returned. Marisha,
if you want to talk about that.

142
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,297
MARISHA: It has returned--

143
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:34,351
TRAVIS: Oh, snap!

144
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:40,629
MARISHA: Oh, my goodness, you guys! The amazing
Darin De Paul, already. He kicked off the season.

145
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,758
TRAVIS: DDP!

146
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,535
LIAM: So good.

147
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:43,744
TALIESIN: It was crazy.

148
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,649
MARISHA: Yes. Yeah, he kind of set the bar really
high.

149
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:46,312
TALIESIN: It was crazy.

150
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,115
MATT: He's awesome.

151
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:50,307
MARISHA: You guys know Darin as the voice of
Reinhardt from Overwatch,

152
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,120
and many other things. But--

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,152
MATT: He's also the main villain, Ardyn,
in Final Fantasy XV

154
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,370
and a bunch of other games. Super talented--

155
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,774
LAURA: He's blowing up! He's in everything now!

156
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,513
MATT: He's incredible.

157
00:05:58,513 --> 00:05:59,369
MARISHA: He's great.

158
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:00,348
SAM: I don't care for him.

159
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:02,692
(All laugh)

160
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:06,814
TRAVIS: I think he's rude. And he smells funny.

161
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:07,488
MATT: There you go.

162
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:10,637
SAM: He didn't want to come on my show, Siggle
Boost.

163
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,593
MARISHA: (laughs)

164
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:12,748
TRAVIS: Siggle Boost?

165
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,644
SAM: Siggle Boost.

166
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,633
MARISHA: Wow, I haven't heard of that one.

167
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,058
TALIESIN: Do you guys just like draw weird
circles?

168
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:18,024
SAM: Yup. Yeah.

169
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,147
TALIESIN: Right, okay. I was just checking.

170
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:20,526
MATT: And people correct you for mispronouncing
it.

171
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:21,742
LAURA: It's called Sigil Boost.

172
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:22,566
MARISHA: Sigil Boost.

173
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:23,642
SAM: That's true, that's true.

174
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:25,505
LIAM: Let's run the GIF (hard g) of that now,
please.

175
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:26,646
TALIESIN: It's pronounced siggle.

176
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,694
MARISHA: Yes, it's back. You should watch it. Yup.

177
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:29,237
TALIESIN: Yeah.

178
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,053
MARISHA: People.

179
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,154
MATT: Yeah, Erika Ishii just did hers--

180
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:31,810
MARISHA: On Tuesdays.

181
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,158
MATT: --and then Amy Dallen's up next, right?

182
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,858
MARISHA: Amy Dallen is up next and--

183
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:35,604
MATT: Awesome.

184
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,046
MARISHA: Yeah. It's good people coming up.

185
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:38,611
TALIESIN: Yeah, you drain Erika Ishii's blood.
It's pretty great.

186
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,023
MARISHA: Yes. We do. Yeah.

187
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,695
LIAM: Yeah, but you can only do it once, though.

188
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:42,363
MARISHA: Yeah.

189
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:43,455
TALIESIN: It's a great trick. You can only do it
once.

190
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,962
MATT: Laura, do you have a merch update?

191
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,364
LAURA: Do I? Do I? Do-

192
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,495
TRAVIS: Do I?

193
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:48,484
MATT: It's on the list.

194
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:50,043
LAURA: We watched Galaxy Quest last night.

195
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,079
TRAVIS: So great.

196
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,767
LAURA: So good. Again. For, like, the hundredth
time. You know, I mean, there's merch in the store

197
00:06:55,767 --> 00:07:00,095
right now. These dice bags that I'm holding in my
hand. I literally just happened to be holding it

198
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:05,883
as you asked me that, which is crazy. There's a
very small amount of them left, I happen to know.

199
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,725
SAM: In the hundreds? In the fifties? In the
tens?

200
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:08,736
TALIESIN: Baker's dozen.

201
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,455
LAURA: In the barely hundreds.

202
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,161
SAM: Wow.

203
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:11,910
MARISHA: Yeah.

204
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,316
TRAVIS: It's a lot.

205
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:14,563
MARISHA: They went fast.

206
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:17,699
LAURA: Which, you know, could be a lot or
couldn't. Depending on if you want them.

207
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,015
SAM: Wow.

208
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:22,252
LAURA: There's also shirts! And hats! And patches
and--

209
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:24,112
MATT: (singing) Things, oh God!

210
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,197
LAURA: -- other stuff coming up that I'm real
excited about,

211
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,808
and I'll show it to you when it's here.

212
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:29,046
TRAVIS: Yep.

213
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:30,550
MATT: (clicking dice) Such a beautiful sound.

214
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,209
TRAVIS: (sniffing) Allergies. (groans)

215
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,318
TALIESIN: You watched Galaxy Quest.

216
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:34,319
LAURA: Yeah.

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,136
TRAVIS: You don't need that-- he can have that
many. You have too many.

218
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,669
TALIESIN: You know they have the dubbed version of
the alien language on the DVD?

219
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:38,543
LAURA: No!

220
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,736
TALIESIN: (alien noises) The whole movie,
the entire movie-- You can watch it, if you're

221
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:41,893
drunk enough.

222
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,140
LAURA: It's just so good.

223
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,938
MARISHA: (laughs)

224
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,473
MATT: That's pretty great. All right!

225
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:45,918
LIAM: I'm ready.

226
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,364
MATT: Anything else anyone wants to talk about? Or
are we good? I think we're good.

227
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,073
TRAVIS: We're good.

228
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:50,849
MARISHA: Yeah.

229
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,109
MATT: So we're going to hop in, and start off
tonight's episode of--

230
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:53,794
LAURA: Oh God.

231
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:54,863
MATT: Critical Role.

232
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:56,536
(All cheer)

233
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:57,289
MARISHA: That's right.

234
00:07:57,289 --> 00:09:27,568
[opening credits]

235
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,140
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back.

236
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,790
(all laugh)

237
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,681
TRAVIS: Well done.

238
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:34,797
MATT: So, to get you up to speed with our current
story: Vox Machina, having just completed the

239
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:39,788
destruction of the Chroma Conclave, a scourge of
ancient chromatic dragons that have terrorized the

240
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:47,838
countryside. They are victorious, yet in the
process lost a couple of lives. Percy returned and

241
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:51,975
Scanlan, his lifeless body brought back to
Whitestone. They completed the ritual correctly,

242
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:57,787
and he came to life; however, he remains
unconscious in a pseudo-coma. They left him in

243
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:04,464
Whitestone, hopefully to recover. While beginning
to finish up some of their last business they've

244
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:10,662
been unable to with the current rush of this
current arc. They made a journey to Vasselheim,

245
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:15,968
where they walked through the Abundant Terrace
and into the Birthheart itself, the temple of

246
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:27,760
Melora within Vasselheim, spoke with one of the
various worshippers there, and buried a box of

247
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,271
ashes, apparently, of Senokir's wife--

248
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,673
MARISHA: "Apparently"

249
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,481
MATT: --as a thank you for when you guys journeyed
and met him in the City of Brass on the Fire

250
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:41,758
Elemental Plane. Upon doing so, you then began to
scatter about the city to do some business.

251
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:45,398
One of the elements of which: Grog Strongjaw,
along with Pike, made their way to the Trial

252
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:53,399
Forge, which is the Kord section of the city.
Returning to the Trial Forge, the temple to Kord,

253
00:10:53,399 --> 00:11:02,748
and upon walking to the center of the strangely
empty temple structure, you saw, down in a once

254
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:09,623
previously traversed sandpit, there stood
Earthbreaker Groon, the high priest of Kord,

255
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,822
who then turned to you--

256
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:12,943
TRAVIS: My palms are really wet.

257
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:13,779
LAURA: (laughs)

258
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:21,278
MATT: --and asked you to "show him what you had
learned." After slamming his feet into the sand

259
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:27,230
and preparing himself for conflict, he beckons you
towards him. And that is where we left off. So--

260
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,078
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god.

261
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:32,979
MATT: --as you're standing up there on the edge of
this pit, Groon just stands there with his hand

262
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:36,026
beckoning towards you.

263
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:42,871
TRAVIS: I reach into my Bag of Holding, and I pull
out a small drawing of the letter "G". This.

264
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:47,460
This is what I have learn-- That's not it.

265
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,671
That's not what I wanted. And I take out
the Dwarven Thrower and I jump into the sandpit.

266
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:59,165
MATT: All righty. (jumping sound) (impact thud)
There, as you land in the sand, the bottoms of

267
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:05,329
your boots sinking but a couple of inches into the
soft surface. Pike gets ready to leap down after

268
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:09,907
and Groon puts his hand up. "No...."

269
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:10,793
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

270
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,593
MATT: This fight is for us.

271
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:13,716
LAURA: Oh, god.

272
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:16,876
LAURA: Yeah, we're here, we're watching it,
right?

273
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,561
MATT: You guys didn't say if you were catching up
with them last time.

274
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:20,128
LAURA: Yeah, we said we came in the temple with
them.

275
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:21,129
MARISHA: Uh, no, we're totally watching this.

276
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,236
TALIESIN: We're here, we're here.

277
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:24,618
MATT: So then you guys rush in afterward,
hoping that--

278
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,524
Morpheus is fighting Neo, you guys--

279
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:27,812
(all laugh)

280
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:36,630
MATT: You all rush in on the outskirts here to
watch. I'll put you in over here to keep an

281
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,046
eye on the sidelines. Grog, I need you to roll
initiative.

282
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,522
LAURA: Oh my god!

283
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:43,651
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry)

284
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:44,661
SAM: Big roll, big roll.

285
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:46,316
MARISHA: Big roll! Big money, no whammies.

286
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,124
LIAM: Now we attack on the count of three.

287
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:49,381
TRAVIS: I get advantage on my (mumbles)

288
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:50,164
TALIESIN: Jenga.

289
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:50,842
LIAM: Get 'im.

290
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:51,525
TRAVIS: That's shit.

291
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:52,242
LAURA: God, oh god.

292
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:52,973
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

293
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:53,911
TRAVIS: That-- that's one worse.

294
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:54,597
TRAVIS: Five!

295
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:55,520
LIAM: Oh!

296
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,456
MATT: You're going second.

297
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:59,369
TRAVIS: Hey! You can go away.

298
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:00,730
LAURA: (laughs) You're in jail.

299
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,756
MARISHA: You know, second has its advantages
sometimes.

300
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:03,637
MATT: (clears throat) So.

301
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:04,354
MARISHA: Sometimes.

302
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:05,068
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

303
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:07,934
MATT: As you land and ready yourself with the
hammer at the side, knowing that all of your

304
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:14,691
friends are up on the outer edges of this watching
you, you look up at Groon, who just, his hands at

305
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:18,900
the ready, puts them down at his sides and
just.... (slow steps)

306
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,838
TRAVIS: Awesome.

307
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:27,925
MATT: Just walks up towards you... And just stands
there. Your turn.

308
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,586
SAM: Like a matador.

309
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:38,811
TRAVIS: What a dick move! What a dick move! Right.
(clears throat) I, uh. I bow.

310
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,640
SAM: Oh!

311
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:48,201
TRAVIS: And say... Kord's strength be with you.
And I smash the Titanstone Knuckles together.

312
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,092
MATT: All righty! (laughs) Off to a start.

313
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,592
SAM: (sound of impact)

314
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:55,065
LAURA: (whispers) Oh my god.

315
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,399
I wish we had popcorn!

316
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,582
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Is
there popcorn in the studio?

317
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,780
DENISE: (off screen) No.

318
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,795
LAURA and MARISHA: Damn it!

319
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:04,007
MARISHA: Damn it, Denise.

320
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:04,961
TALIESIN and LAURA: (laugh)

321
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:05,790
DENISE: (off screen) Sorry!

322
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,355
(all laugh)

323
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:10,684
MARISHA: Always the bearer of bad news, that one.

324
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,557
MATT: All right.

325
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:13,877
TALIESIN: Don't say her name three times,
then your rolls won't come true.

326
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:24,429
TRAVIS: I would like to move backwards three
squares.

327
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:25,614
MATT: Okay.

328
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,984
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

329
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:32,004
MATT: All right. On his turn he stands there.

330
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:32,819
LAURA: Ahh!

331
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:33,971
MATT: He stares right at you.

332
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:34,826
TRAVIS: Fucking knew it!

333
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:35,716
MATT: Arms at the side--

334
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:37,006
TRAVIS: What is-- It's a test already!

335
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,238
MARISHA: Waiting for you to go first?

336
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:42,522
TRAVIS: I hate the SATs! I hate Scantrons,
I hate number two pencils, I hate all of it!

337
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,916
(all laugh)

338
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:48,111
LIAM: Don't blink, don't blink. Roll with it,
player.

339
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:50,420
TRAVIS: MM-hm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

340
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,110
MARISHA: It's totally--

341
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,521
TRAVIS: I start in that same distance from him,
the same radial distance, I start walking to my

342
00:14:55,521 --> 00:15:04,097
right. My full speed.

343
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:05,680
MATT: Okay.

344
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,239
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

345
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:14,736
MATT: He turns with you as you move and just
rights himself and stares at you. Your turn.

346
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,411
(all laugh)

347
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:17,717
SAM: Worst chess game ever.

348
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,763
LAURA: I know, right?

349
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:20,113
LIAM: Smash cut to two hours later.

350
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:21,011
(all laugh)

351
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:22,066
MATT: I know.

352
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:22,839
TRAVIS: All right. Okay.

353
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,340
SAM: "What do you want me to do!"

354
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,663
LAURA: "Are you hungry? I'm kind of hungry."

355
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:31,484
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

356
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:34,312
MATT: Okay. (woosh) So--

357
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:42,831
TRAVIS: And I do so by taking the...dwarven
thrower and smashing it against my chest.

358
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,680
And then I chuck it at him.

359
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,367
MATT: All right. As you slam it into your chest,
you can feel the impact, and there's that brief

360
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:55,642
sharp bit of pain as the metal clashes against the
muscle, slamming against the bone and your rib

361
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:59,913
cage. And that pain just kind of shoots through
you like exciting electricity and you harness the

362
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:04,672
pain as your eyes blur for a moment as you feel
the rage overtake you, your muscles flexing and

363
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:10,188
tensing and with that fury now flowing through
your body, you take the hammer. I need you to go

364
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:12,084
ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

365
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,279
SAM: Oh no.

366
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,313
LAURA: Oh shit.

367
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:15,907
TRAVIS: (whispers) I knew it. (louder) I mean,
I didn't know it.

368
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:18,458
SAM: Oh no.

369
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,573
TRAVIS: Which is a minus two, right?

370
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:22,703
MATT: Yes.

371
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:25,153
TRAVIS: That's a six.

372
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:29,935
MATT: As you go to throw, the strength leaves your
arm and it just hangs limp at the side.

373
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:31,019
The attack is lost.

374
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:36,446
TRAVIS: Any reason why?

375
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:37,296
MATT: You don't know.

376
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:42,497
TRAVIS: Not that I'd know. Cool. Do I have another
attack?

377
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:44,730
MATT: Yeah. You have two attacks.

378
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,200
MARISHA: He just Jedi mind-tricked you.

379
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,359
TRAVIS: I shake off the random numb arm,
and I toss it over to the other hand like,

380
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:53,439
"C'mon, Betsy!" And I throw it with that hand.

381
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:54,325
(all laugh)

382
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:57,828
MATT: Okay. Roll another wisdom saving throw.

383
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:03,522
TRAVIS: I don't know D&amp;D enough to know what the
fuck's happening right now. Ooh! 16?

384
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:08,230
MATT: Uh, 16, actually let me see this real fast.

385
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,270
TRAVIS: I have a modifier of zero. Minus two.

386
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,256
LAURA: Minus two.

387
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,429
TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.

388
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,115
TALIESIN: Monks are not in my wheelhouse.

389
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,657
MATT: Monks are fun.

390
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:22,163
MARISHA: I feel like this guy's special, too.

391
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,448
TRAVIS: He's not even here. This is a dream.

392
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:28,405
LIAM: Slowly, Raishan uncurls like a Xenomorph
from the ceiling.

393
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:29,242
MATT: What'd you roll?

394
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:30,029
TRAVIS: 16.

395
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:33,857
MATT: Nope. This time, you do manage to push
through and throw the hammer, but you end up

396
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:38,708
throwing it way wide. Like, 20 feet away from him.
Like, you're looking at him and just go (whoosh)

397
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,927
(all laugh)

398
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:44,865
MATT: It comes back, and you catch it, and you're
like, something's just messing with your mind.

399
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,411
There's something about his presence right now
that is

400
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:51,288
oppressing your ability to actually attack
towards him.

401
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:54,689
TRAVIS: All right. All I have is my bonus action.

402
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,464
MATT: Well, you used your bonus action to rage,
right?

403
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:59,036
TRAVIS: Oh I did, yeah. I don't have a bonus
action. That's my turn.

404
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,031
MATT: All right. He turns towards you. Walks
forward--

405
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,119
TRAVIS: No, I don't.

406
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,574
MATT: --very, just, carefully and intently.
That's his turn. You go.

407
00:18:10,574 --> 00:18:12,451
TRAVIS: God dang it!

408
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:18,339
LAURA: Oh man. What does he want-a!

409
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,155
TALIESIN: (whispering) Popcorn.

410
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:20,455
LAURA: (whispering) He wants popcorn.

411
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:21,613
TALIESIN:  (whispering) He wants popcorn.

412
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:23,293
TRAVIS: I try and hit him with it with both
hands.

413
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:24,771
MATT: Okay, so you you're using both hands--

414
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,933
TRAVIS: Yeah, both hands.

415
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,496
MATT: Go for it. Roll a wisdom saving throw.

416
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:29,425
(laughter)

417
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,812
LIAM: Look at his little boy smile.

418
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,466
TRAVIS: Six!

419
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:35,923
MATT: You go to swing and he seems to blur for a
moment, your eyes blink and as you swing with the

420
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:40,937
hammer, you swung far to your left and it's almost
like your arms are intentionally missing and

421
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:43,609
almost fighting your directoral sense.

422
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,604
LAURA: Shut up, Brian Wayne Foster!

423
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:49,328
MARISHA: Awesome! Brian Fostah.

424
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:55,098
TRAVIS: This is so stupid! Okay, I keep the hammer
in one hand but I just try and punch him with the

425
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:56,977
Titanstone Knuckles out of frustration.

426
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,730
MATT: Okay. Make a wisdom saving throw.

427
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,260
TRAVIS: What? No weapon in my hand?

428
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,280
MATT: Mm-hm.

429
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,698
TRAVIS: Nine!

430
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:10,735
MATT: You go to punch and by the time it gets to
his chest there's so little force behind it that

431
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:16,103
your fingers just kind of unfold open against him,
almost breaking your wrist in the process,

432
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:24,726
and you pull back, and he's just staring right at
you. "Show me you have the will to fight.

433
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:31,243
Come at me!" Are you going to move or are you 
going to stay where you are?

434
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:35,958
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay within his attack range,
but I'm going to 180 around him.

435
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,891
MATT: Okay. That's easy enough to get around here.
All righty.

436
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:41,138
TRAVIS: And I'll stay there.

437
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,251
MATT: All right. For his turn, he turns around--

438
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:46,412
TRAVIS: No he doesn't. Come on. Come on.

439
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:47,478
MATT: Your turn.

440
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:51,913
TRAVIS: Oh, this is a nightmare. I just want to
hit him!

441
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:54,896
(all laugh)

442
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:59,400
TRAVIS: All right. All right. Maybe it's all
about love!

443
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,487
And I try and give him a bear hug!

444
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,291
MATT: Okay... make a wisdom saving
throw.

445
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:08,368
TRAVIS: No!

446
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,256
LAURA: You got this.

447
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:10,345
Natural 20.

448
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:11,640
TRAVIS: That's a zero.

449
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,030
(all laugh)

450
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,060
TRAVIS: I rolled a two.

451
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,754
LAURA: Two zero, exactly.

452
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:20,305
MATT: You go to grab him, and you
reach, and you feel this physical form in your

453
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:24,286
grasp, and then your arms all of a sudden touch
nothing, and you realize that he's standing where

454
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:29,977
he was. You grabbed what was almost like a mirage
or an illusion, it's almost like your brain is

455
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:35,531
playing tricks on you. That's one attack.

456
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:36,933
TRAVIS: (surprised grunt)

457
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:41,108
LAURA: You can do it, Grog! I don't know 
what he wants, but figure it out!

458
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:42,853
TRAVIS: I look so pathetic right now.

459
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,553
SAM: Yo, how does it look to the rest of the
gang?

460
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:45,981
MATT: It looks hilarious.

461
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:46,992
(all laugh)

462
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:48,357
LIAM: What did we just see?

463
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:50,445
MATT: It's
hilarious, and it's disconcerting, because you're

464
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:55,804
watching as Grog, in the middle of his rage,
most of his attacks are amateur, far too wide

465
00:20:55,991 --> 00:21:03,064
away from the target, or by the time they get
close, he is holding himself back. And you don't

466
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:07,183
know why. Something is messing with his will and
preventing him

467
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:12,712
from being able to follow through 
with his attacks.

468
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:15,453
TRAVIS: Okay. (sighs)

469
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:16,748
MATT: Second attack?

470
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:22,828
TRAVIS: Second attack. I just want to touch him
with my finger. Just, like, a boop.

471
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:25,154
MATT: Okay. You reach out and your
finger touches his chest

472
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:26,073
(cracking sound),
and you feel--

473
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:27,451
TRAVIS: He's real?! He's there?!

474
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,203
MATT: He's real. The skin's there.

475
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:32,412
TRAVIS: Thought you might be a dragon.
Wisdom saving throw?

476
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:33,773
MATT: That wasn't an
attack.

477
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:34,856
TRAVIS: Oh! I touched him!

478
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:35,704
MATT: You touched him.

479
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,008
LAURA: Great job, Grog!

480
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,330
MARISHA: We believe in you, Grog!

481
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,798
LIAM: Okay, now ramp it up!

482
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,034
(all laugh)

483
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:45,286
MATT: He smiles at you and goes,
"And with gentleness there comes clarity."

484
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:49,054
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing)

485
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:51,051
SAM: I think
you're going to have to fuck him, Grog.

486
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:54,579
(all laugh)

487
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,737
MATT: And that's your turn?

488
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:56,420
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

489
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,685
MATT: Okay.

490
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,251
SAM: (quietly) What? With gentleness there comes--?

491
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:02,661
MATT: "With
gentleness there comes clarity." And he smiles

492
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:08,894
through his big, white-grey beard. And then the
smile fades, his eyes flash, and he is going to

493
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:12,189
attack you with a flurry of blows.

494
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,630
LAURA: Oh no.

495
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,878
TRAVIS: Wait, I haven't learned the lesson yet. I'm still--

496
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,151
MATT: The lesson's just begun.

497
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:20,503
TRAVIS: Oh no.

498
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:24,693
MATT: All right, that is-- ooh.
33 to hit.

499
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,610
TRAVIS: (squeaky voice) Mmm, yep.

500
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,730
MATT: That is a 24 to hit.

501
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,037
TRAVIS: (squeaky voice) Yep.

502
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:33,749
MATT: That is a natural one.

503
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:39,124
So that is a failure. And it's a 32 to hit,
so he hits you three times.

504
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,276
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

505
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,619
MATT: So you're raging, so you take half damage
from these, because they're bludgeoning,

506
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:45,889
since he's punching you.

507
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,166
TRAVIS: Mmhmm.

508
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,851
MATT: His eyes flash, he rushes up and pummels

509
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:54,731
you once in the chin, elbows you in the sternum,
goes and grabs your shoulder and leaps over

510
00:22:54,731 --> 00:23:00,253
behind you and then kicks straight back into the
middle of your shoulder blades and (pained gasp)

511
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,698
you feel the breath almost get kicked out of you.

512
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:09,262
That is 15 bludgeoning damage, halved to--

513
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:10,454
TRAVIS: Seven?

514
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:11,495
MATT: We'll say eight.

515
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:12,968
TRAVIS: Eight? Yeah.

516
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:22,219
MATT: That is nine, reduced to five,
and that is 13 reduced to seven. There you go.

517
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,411
TRAVIS: Oh shit, that's 20 points of damage.
Cool.

518
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:26,245
MATT: That's his turn. You're
up.

519
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:31,745
TRAVIS: Uh, yeah. Sweet, sweet anus.

520
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,406
MARISHA: That's a really good British
candy.

521
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:43,034
TRAVIS: What do monks do? Can I, like,
use my magic powers? And I want to keep my eyes

522
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:48,167
closed, and I'm gonna swing around behind me,
knowing that I just got kicked in the back there.

523
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,085
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack with
disadvantage.

524
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:52,616
TRAVIS: Oh! No wisdom saving
throw?

525
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:53,498
MATT: Nope.

526
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,062
LAURA: With gentleness comes clarity.

527
00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:58,821
You touched him, maybe if you'd've shaken
his hand.

528
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,095
TRAVIS: With disadvantage?

529
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:03,573
MATT: With disadvantage, because you have your
eyes closed.

530
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:06,470
TRAVIS: Uh, 23.

531
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,913
MATT: That just barely hits.

532
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,035
(all gasp)

533
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,737
MATT: Go ahead and roll
damage.

534
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:14,105
TRAVIS: (mumbling) Okay, with a ten.

535
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:15,685
SAM: So what did we learn from that?

536
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:17,180
TRAVIS: I
should've done it reckless. No, I don't want him

537
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,745
rolling reckless, holy shit! God, I'll die in a
second.

538
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:21,214
MARISHA: His AC's 23.

539
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:23,993
SAM: No, that-- close your eyes-- or, how
does this... what?

540
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:25,233
LIAM: It might be touch.

541
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,469
SAM: I'm so confused.

542
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:27,779
LIAM: You're unconscious.

543
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,072
TALIESIN: You've got the touch.

544
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:31,211
TRAVIS: That's 18 points of damage.

545
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:34,771
MATT: 18 points of damage, gotcha.
That's your first strike (hitting sound).

546
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:40,624
You feel the weapon behind you make contact with
a form, and (cracking noise), you see a little bit

547
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:43,776
of sand out of your peripheral this side go
(scattering sound) as his form gets pushed about a

548
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,044
foot, kind of setting some of it off.

549
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:47,778
TRAVIS: So
it goes (low hitting sound). I close my eyes

550
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,078
again. I swing around the other way, and I try to
connect.

551
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:59,397
MATT: Okay, roll again with disadvantage.

552
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:05,329
TRAVIS: That's not bad. 14 and 20,
uh... 29.

553
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,443
MATT: That hits, yes.

554
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:10,900
TRAVIS: Yes, okay. Damn, same thing, so
18 points of damage.

555
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:17,161
MATT: 18 points of damage. All righty.

556
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:23,627
As he takes both impacts, kind of parrying them
with his forearms with each impact. They're still

557
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:28,955
hitting him, and he's still taking the brunt of
the attack and the pain, but with each hit you can

558
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:35,071
feel the force of his forearm is almost stopping
still the hammer blow as you're throwing it behind

559
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:39,615
you, and you can see him gritting teeth with each
impact, but he's just staring right at you again

560
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:45,829
as you kind of spin around, open your eye again to
see what you did.

561
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:48,907
He kind of gives you a bit of a
narrowed glare--

562
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:49,948
TRAVIS: Stink eye?

563
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,007
MATT: Little bit of a stink eye.

564
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,718
TRAVIS: Fuck.

565
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,603
MATT: But like an intentional kind of connecting
point and just says--

566
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:54,728
TRAVIS: Pink eye?

567
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:57,873
MATT: No, that's a whole different--
that's a different monk path.

568
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:00,461
(all laugh)

569
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:06,862
LAURA: Like that little hobbit.

570
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:08,006
TRAVIS: Be nice.

571
00:26:08,006 --> 00:26:09,319
MATT: Let's see
here.

572
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,456
TRAVIS: I'm a student here.

573
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:13,304
LAURA: What's the lesson? What's the lesson?!

574
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:15,102
MATT: Okay,
he's going to go ahead and attack you twice.

575
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:18,884
(punch sound) Two punches, straight to your back
of your shoulders and neck as you're turning

576
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:25,658
around to look at him. That is a 17, misses.
No, that does hit.

577
00:26:25,658 --> 00:26:27,425
TRAVIS: That hits, yeah, it's my AC.

578
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:28,517
MATT: And a 23.

579
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:29,194
TRAVIS: Yeah.

580
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:34,136
MATT: So both hit you. That is... 
16, so eight damage.

581
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:35,630
TRAVIS: Okay.

582
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,412
MATT: And that is ten, so five damage.

583
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:39,071
TRAVIS: Okay.

584
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:44,171
MATT: And he's going to spend three ki.

585
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:45,592
TRAVIS: Three ki?!

586
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:49,207
MATT: Yeah, three ki points. 
So, the first punch hits you across

587
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:54,760
the chin. The second one, he slams his fingers,
curled up, right into your sternum as you turn

588
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,230
around to face him (whack), and as it hits you,
you feel these kind of vibrations, ripples,

589
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,444
carry through your body, and then slowly fade
inside. And you feel this tingling, this very

590
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:10,745
faint, brief numbness that just kind of lingers
throughout your body. You can feel it gathering at

591
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:18,600
the edge of fingertips and toes, almost like
ripples through a lake, and he steps away.

592
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,745
You get to make an attack of opportunity if you'd
like.

593
00:27:20,745 --> 00:27:23,051
TRAVIS: (strained) I would.

594
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:25,204
MATT: Don't forget, you can use your reaction to
get an attack back because of

595
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,361
your retaliation ability.

596
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:32,430
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've totally forgotten that,
I'm just totally stunned at this point.

597
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,942
That's good, that's 32.

598
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:38,016
MATT: 32 hits.
Go ahead and roll damage.

599
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:41,419
TRAVIS: (sing-songy noises) That's a ten.

600
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:42,630
LAURA: Yeah.

601
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,043
LIAM: All
these sounds are in game, in character.

602
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:45,144
TRAVIS: So 20, 25.

603
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:47,125
LAURA and LIAM: (gibberish)

604
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:52,270
MARISHA: (laughs) When Grog becomes Popeye.

605
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,520
MATT: All righty, and he just stands across the way,
and just kind of beckons you towards him.

606
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,524
Your turn.

607
00:27:57,524 --> 00:27:59,113
TRAVIS: And I feel all shake-weighty
at the moment, right?

608
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,480
MATT: Yeah. You're not quite sure.

609
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,025
You don't feel bad, it's just this
kind of uneasiness in your body.

610
00:28:04,025 --> 00:28:05,680
TRAVIS: Can I take a step towards him?

611
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,596
MATT: Mm-hm, take a
step forward.

612
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,272
TRAVIS: Does anything happen? Do I
shit my pants?

613
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:10,792
MATT: Nope.

614
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:11,779
(all laugh)

615
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:13,499
MATT: Not yet.

616
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:15,416
TRAVIS: Can I take the other four steps

617
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:21,268
of the five step exploding heart point technique
thing?

618
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,574
MATT: Seems fine.

619
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:24,497
TRAVIS: Cool.

620
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:26,475
MARISHA: What would you have done if you shat
your pants on that fifth step?

621
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:27,648
LAURA: Oh my god,
that would have been amazing.

622
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,995
TRAVIS: Just
explosive shat. I'd be, like, kill me now.

623
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:32,337
Kill me now, take it away.

624
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,854
MARISHA: Just lost
your bowels.

625
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:37,150
MATT: (laughs) I'd have to bring
out the cone template for that.

626
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,835
MARISHA: Like a
very dedicated marathon runner.

627
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:42,432
LAURA: (laughs) Area of effect?

628
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:44,976
TRAVIS: Can I close the rest of
the distance to him?

629
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:50,158
MATT: Sure.

630
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:52,709
TRAVIS: I want to try the bear hug again.
I want to grapple him.

631
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:58,578
MATT: Okay. So, go ahead. And I think it's your
athletics versus his--

632
00:28:58,578 --> 00:29:00,208
TRAVIS: So I can touch him
now.

633
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,984
MATT: (mumbling) Acrobatics, I'm pretty
sure.

634
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:05,296
TRAVIS: The wisdom saving throw was
something in the beginning.

635
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:06,774
LAURA: Yeah, I think it was,

636
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:09,356
you have to shake his hand or do
something, like, gentle to him.

637
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:12,278
LIAM: I like the idea that it's silent in here and
we're just hearing sand get kicked around

638
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:14,769
and Grog breathing like a bull.

639
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:18,253
LAURA: I like to think that Earthbreaker
Groon has, like, mood music for his fights.

640
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:19,434
MARISHA: Agreed, yeah.

641
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:20,832
TRAVIS: There's
frustrated grunts happening.

642
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:21,891
LAURA: He's got a sound system.

643
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,047
MATT: So, make an athletics check.

644
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:23,791
TRAVIS: Okay.

645
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:24,823
MARISHA: Like war drums, yeah.

646
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:25,776
TALIESIN: Like taiko. (low drum sounds)

647
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:27,174
LAURA: Ooh! That'd be sick.

648
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,371
MARISHA: (joins in on the drum sounds)
Totally.

649
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:31,366
TRAVIS: 24. Plus 16 plus
eight.

650
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:34,040
MATT: Yeah, okay, so you go to grab him and he
just (fwish) slips out.

651
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,653
TRAVIS: Damn. My
athletics versus his? Judo?

652
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,846
MATT: He just kind of like parries it to the side,

653
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,462
ducks under and
rights himself, just out of your grasp.

654
00:29:45,462 --> 00:29:48,747
TRAVIS: Cool, that was nice. Do I have a second
attack?

655
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,431
MATT: Yeah.

656
00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:54,353
TRAVIS: Two-handed great weapon master, please.

657
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:58,771
MATT: Okay, go for it.

658
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:02,602
TRAVIS: That's not going to hit. 24.

659
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:03,950
MATT: 24 hits.

660
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,742
TRAVIS: Oh, it does?

661
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:05,359
MATT: Yeah.

662
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,434
TRAVIS: Oh, 23, that's right.

663
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:07,636
LIAM: 23 was the threshold.

664
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:09,736
TRAVIS: Thank you, god. No it doesn't, 24 minus
five.

665
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:15,101
MATT: Oh, minus five. So, as you go to swing,
both of your hands on the hammer, (grunts) giant

666
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:22,301
downward arc. As it slams downward, you see his
form (whoosh) shift, and suddenly he's two feet to

667
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:27,263
the right. He moved so fast with the side step,
and you slam it down into the sand. You guys

668
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:32,478
watch as this crater emerges (boom), and the sand
shoots off the sides from the impact of Grog's

669
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:36,096
blow on the ground. Groon seemingly unaffected.

670
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:42,048
TRAVIS: That ends my--

671
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,165
MATT: You're not frenzied yet, right?

672
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:47,949
TRAVIS: Nope. That ends my turn. Yep.

673
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:55,164
MATT: Okay. At the end of your turn, he's going to
go ahead and make an unarmed attack on you.

674
00:30:55,164 --> 00:30:56,749
TRAVIS: Unarmed attack?

675
00:30:56,749 --> 00:31:00,974
MATT: That's just his punch as a part of his
legendary action here. That is a 27 to hit.

676
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:03,329
TRAVIS: Oh, that hits.

677
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,250
MATT: You suffer another ten points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to five.

678
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,333
TRAVIS: Okay.

679
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,952
MATT: Now it's Groon's turn.

680
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:14,708
TALIESIN: Two lair actions.

681
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:25,061
MATT: He's gonna go ahead and make another series
of attacks on you. That is an 18?

682
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,279
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.

683
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,314
MATT: 17.

684
00:31:28,314 --> 00:31:29,782
TRAVIS: Hits, also.

685
00:31:29,782 --> 00:31:33,793
MATT: All right. So that is nine plus eight.
That'd be 17.

686
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:36,257
So, say nine points of bludgeoning.

687
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,961
TRAVIS: Nine?

688
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:44,183
MATT: And then--ooh! 18. So another nine points of
bludgeoning damage. I need you to go ahead and

689
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:46,379
make a constitution saving throw.

690
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:50,639
TRAVIS: Damn, Gina.

691
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:54,272
LIAM: Nice pull.

692
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:56,387
SAM: I don't get it.

693
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:57,606
TRAVIS: 21.

694
00:31:57,606 --> 00:32:06,039
MATT: 21, okay. As his first hit is a long round
haymaker punch across the chin, he comes from

695
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:11,340
underneath and goes for an uppercut that hits you
right in the jaw. Right at the side where usually

696
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,146
it would snap and really mess with somebody's
ability to stay either conscious or control their

697
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:21,618
atmosphere. You just manage to maneuver out of the
way where it hurts, but the impact doesn't hit its

698
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:25,585
intended place, and you resist the effect.

699
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:26,808
TRAVIS: What was the effect?

700
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:27,602
MATT: You don't know.

701
00:32:27,602 --> 00:32:29,858
TRAVIS: God damn it.

702
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:30,871
SAM: Diarrhea.

703
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,254
LAURA: Instant knockout.

704
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:33,673
TRAVIS: I'll shit my pants before this fight is
over with.

705
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:34,799
LAURA: The button.

706
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,710
TRAVIS: On the button?

707
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,537
LAURA: It's the button.

708
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,781
TRAVIS: It's the brown note.

709
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,273
MATT: It's your turn.

710
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:44,107
TRAVIS: My turn. I am so tired of this slippery
shit. I go into a frenzied rage!

711
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:45,018
MATT: Okay.

712
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:49,040
(unenthused cheering)

713
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,920
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you. I would like to Great
Weapon Master

714
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,072
try to hit him with the Dwarven Thrower.

715
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:58,590
MATT: Go for it.

716
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,792
TRAVIS: Not reckless.

717
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:14,513
No. (crying) I don't know what the lesson
is. 32 minus five is 37.

718
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:15,142
MATT: 27?

719
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:16,436
TRAVIS: 27!

720
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:17,638
MATT: That hits.

721
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:24,201
TRAVIS: Yeah. 32 minus five is 37! 35.

722
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:34,013
MATT: Okay. This one cracks him right across the
side of his shoulder and pec area (wham),

723
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:38,453
and you watch as for the first time since this
battle started, he loses his footing, and he has

724
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:42,987
to catch himself behind. His head looks back and
he turns around towards you and a big smile goes

725
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:48,893
across his face as he goes, "Good. Keep showing
me."

726
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,703
TRAVIS: I was encouraged until he got creepy with
the talking.

727
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:55,145
LAURA: Maybe he just likes getting hit.

728
00:33:55,306 --> 00:33:56,725
TRAVIS: All right, I hit him again!

729
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:57,871
MATT: Go for it.

730
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:02,058
TRAVIS: That's gonna hit. That's a 31 minus five
is 26.

731
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:05,020
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.

732
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:09,918
TRAVIS: 22... 32.

733
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,183
MATT: 32. Nice.

734
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:16,988
LAURA: He's got like 5,000 hit points. More than
last time.

735
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,306
TRAVIS: Last one. Reckless.

736
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:20,191
MATT: Okay.

737
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,573
LAURA: (gasps)

738
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,257
TRAVIS: What's life without a little spice?

739
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:24,775
MATT: Sure.

740
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:26,946
MARISHA: Ask him.

741
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:31,435
TRAVIS: 18, not quite. 34 minus--29.

742
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:32,395
MATT: That hits, yeah.

743
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:47,769
TRAVIS: Yeah. Close to what I wanted. This is 33.

744
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:54,350
MATT: Okay, cool. All right, so, as you unleash
your next series of blows against him, you saw him

745
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,961
topple from the first hit. The other two,
he pulls his arms in and takes them, one to the

746
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:01,554
shoulder, and the other one hits him in the
stomach (air getting knocked out) and he grabs

747
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:09,705
your arm, and pushes off. Jumps in the air and
lands about five feet from you.

748
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:14,669
TRAVIS: Is he bruised? Is there a slap mark? I
mean, is there any blood? Anything to tell me that

749
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:16,314
I might be doing a good job?

750
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,352
MATT: He looks, more so than the previous fight that
you had with him,

751
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:21,909
it looks like he's starting to take some hits.

752
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:24,021
TRAVIS: Good! Yeah.

753
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,101
MATT: He's gonna use Legendary Action to take a
hit on you.

754
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:27,953
LIAM: A Legendary Action?

755
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:30,701
MATT: That is a 30.

756
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:32,275
TRAVIS: (squeaks) Hits.

757
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,973
MATT: Actually it's with advantage because--

758
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:35,319
TRAVIS: Yep.

759
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:37,961
MATT: So that is another nine points of
bludgeoning damage.

760
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:38,654
TRAVIS: Sweet.

761
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:40,183
MATT: Not halved. That is what it is halved.

762
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:41,420
TRAVIS: Okay. Because it's legendary--

763
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,713
MATT: Because it would be 18, yeah.

764
00:35:42,713 --> 00:35:44,187
TRAVIS: Right.

765
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:56,876
MATT: Okay. His turn. He slowly walks around you.
And says, "Your size is useful for those who know

766
00:35:56,876 --> 00:36:05,213
not how to use it against you." And he rushes
down, beneath your large standing form, and goes

767
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:09,181
into a series of strikes against the inside of
your knees and your legs

768
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:11,988
and we'll see how the last blow hits.

769
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:14,024
TRAVIS: I've been forgetting to roll my enlarged
damage.

770
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:16,393
MATT: That's a 30 on the first hit.

771
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:18,886
TRAVIS: Yep.

772
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,387
MATT: That is a 21 on the second hit.

773
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,017
TRAVIS: (high pitched) Yeah, sure.

774
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:28,250
MATT: That is a 29 on the third hit.

775
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,248
TRAVIS: (laughs) How many hits are there?!

776
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:31,163
LAURA: Four.

777
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:32,954
MATT: And natural 20 on the fourth.

778
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:34,268
LIAM: Natural 20 to the gooch.

779
00:36:34,268 --> 00:36:35,822
LAURA: To the chode hit?!

780
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:37,475
TRAVIS: Wow, had to Reckless, huh?

781
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:38,210
MATT: Yeah.

782
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,251
TRAVIS: Cool.

783
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:41,327
TRAVIS: Vegas is a short trip this time.

784
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:44,171
MATT: So that is 18 reduced to half; that's nine.

785
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:46,141
TRAVIS: Okay.

786
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:49,516
MATT: 14 reduced in half is seven.

787
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:51,564
TRAVIS: Okay.

788
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:53,147
MATT: That is a nine reduced in half is five.

789
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,137
TRAVIS: Okay.

790
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:59,985
MATT: And final strike is a 20. Reduced in half,
that is ten.

791
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:03,081
TRAVIS: Can I use my Stone's Endurance on that
last one?

792
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:04,117
MATT: Sure! Go for it.

793
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:05,267
TRAVIS: All right.

794
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:09,592
LAURA: Nice.

795
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:18,481
TRAVIS: That's 12. Plus my constitution,
which is five, so 17.

796
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:22,393
MATT: And I would like you to make another
constitution save.

797
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:26,509
TRAVIS: Shit! So do I add 17 hit points back?

798
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:29,352
MATT: No, you reduce the attack, which was 10
damage?

799
00:37:29,352 --> 00:37:30,817
TRAVIS: Yeah, so just wipe it out?

800
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,499
MATT: Yeah, it does none.

801
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:34,873
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. I'm getting down there.

802
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:36,548
LAURA: Really?

803
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,563
SAM: He's down to triple digits now.

804
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:44,078
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw. 18.

805
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:45,081
MATT: 18.

806
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:47,189
TRAVIS: Ten plus ten minus two is 18.

807
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:53,762
MATT: Okay. You feel from that impact, all of your
muscles seize up. He goes for the same strike zone

808
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:59,222
on the other side of the chin and hits and you
kind of (groans) as you pull back. And then,

809
00:37:59,222 --> 00:38:03,085
feel all of a sudden this pulse (throbbing
sound). The pulse (louder throbbing sound) and all

810
00:38:03,085 --> 00:38:05,888
your muscles tense up. You're stunned until the
end of your next turn.

811
00:38:05,888 --> 00:38:07,142
TRAVIS: Shit! (laughs)

812
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:09,623
LAURA: What does being stunned do? You can't
move?

813
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,720
MATT: Can't move, can't do anything, you're
considered incapacitated.

814
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,227
TRAVIS: He Vulcan Pinched my ass.

815
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:16,714
LIAM: Groon's in Vegas and your ass just came up
pineapples.

816
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:19,675
LIAM &amp; TRAVIS: (slot machine ringing)

817
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:23,931
LAURA: I'm gonna pull an arrow out and just stand
there and get ready in case Groon does anything.

818
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:30,601
MATT: Okay. Groon is thinking to go ahead and step
back to there.

819
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,009
TRAVIS: What?

820
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,066
MATT: Which would be there.

821
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:36,612
LAURA: He's waiting for you to become unstunned.

822
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:37,658
TRAVIS: Okay.

823
00:38:37,658 --> 00:38:40,366
MATT: And as he darts back, you guys watch as he
runs to the back. As he does, his feet barely

824
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:44,590
touch the sand (fast, light footsteps). You see
these very faint little plumes behind each

825
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,550
footstep, as this giant man has almost no weight
across the ground--

826
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,740
TRAVIS: Like a jackrabbit.

827
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,730
MATT:--as he runs with such speed. And as he lands
and finds his footing (loud boom), the weight

828
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,429
seems to kick in once more, and you watch as the
sand (scattering sound) shoots out behind him.

829
00:38:55,429 --> 00:39:00,753
He stands his ground and crosses his arms,
and just watches. So Grog, it's your turn.

830
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:06,070
You're stunned. You end your turn, you're no
longer stunned. It's now back to him.

831
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,729
TRAVIS: (whispers) Fuck.

832
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,706
MATT: He puts his hand up. Puts it up towards
you.

833
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:13,121
SAM: Oh, no.

834
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:14,649
MATT: Closes his fingers

835
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:16,278
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I've seen this before.

836
00:39:16,278 --> 00:39:19,654
MATT: And you feel this (pulse) in your chest,
right in the sternum right where he hit you

837
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:32,549
earlier. I need you to go ahead and roll a
constitution saving throw again.

838
00:39:32,615 --> 00:39:34,090
TRAVIS: 23 minus two, 21?

839
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,037
SAM: Ooh?

840
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:36,044
MATT: 21!

841
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:37,019
SAM: Ooh!

842
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:38,892
TRAVIS: Constitution I have a lot of. For my
saving throws.

843
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:43,828
MATT: That (pulse) sound ripples out (rapid
impacts) and you feel the muscles begin to tear,

844
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:48,932
the ligaments begin to burn from the inside.
You manage to, through the sheer force of

845
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:54,304
physical constitution, shrug off what would've
been immensely more deadly circumstance,

846
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:56,606
but you still do take 10d10 necrotic damage.

847
00:39:56,606 --> 00:39:58,063
(everyone groans)

848
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,174
SAM: It would've been 20d10?

849
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:01,884
MATT: No, you would've dropped to zero hit points.

850
00:40:01,884 --> 00:40:03,684
LAURA: Oh shit.

851
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:05,083
TRAVIS: Is that the palm thing?

852
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:05,982
MARISHA: Quivering Palm?

853
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:08,023
MATT: It's the Quivering Palm. He's not holding
back this time.

854
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:09,051
LAURA: Oh no!

855
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:12,117
TRAVIS: Oh, I mean, don't make any special
exceptions on my part. Fuck.

856
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:14,232
LIAM: Vax is watching; he just leaked a little
bit.

857
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:16,005
LAURA: Gross!

858
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:18,678
MATT: 18... 26.

859
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:20,323
SAM: (whispers) Quivering Palm...

860
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:26,467
LAURA: No one will ever notice, the armor already
stinks.

861
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,650
MATT: Take 51 points of necrotic damage.

862
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,458
TRAVIS: 52?

863
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,693
MATT: 51 points of necrotic damage.

864
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:35,424
TRAVIS: 51. Okay.

865
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:37,226
LAURA: How much damage?

866
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,220
MATT: 51 points of necrotic damage.

867
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,651
TRAVIS: I'm out of the triple digits guys.

868
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:42,542
LAURA: (gasps)

869
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,689
SAM: Oh, man.

870
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:46,546
LAURA: Does Grog look all bloody yet, or is he--

871
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:49,552
MATT: You guys watch as Grog is standing there,
his body shakes and shimmers, and you watch

872
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:54,963
various veins that usually bulge in his rage and
enhance blood flow of his combat just (bursts and

873
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:59,423
splatters) bursts in places. And blood just seems
to spray out of him from multiple positions on his

874
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:04,227
body.  And you see the blood now leaking all over
him. He's just covered in his own crimson.

875
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:07,667
He slowly turns around, prepares himself for the
next round of combat.

876
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,779
LIAM: That is some North Star shit.

877
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:10,784
MARISHA: Oh, my god.

878
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:11,852
TALIESIN: Nice.

879
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:24,494
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. (exhales) Good deal.
Tight. Wow, distance doesn't help. Okay.

880
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:29,324
LAURA: Can you talk to him? (louder) Can you talk
to him?

881
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:35,293
TRAVIS: I just look up, covered like Carrie,
in the movie. Just dripping with fake blood.

882
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:40,135
LAURA: Never mind! You're doing great, Grog! Keep
going. (whispers) He looks like shit.

883
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:41,660
MARISHA: (whispers) He does.

884
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:49,807
SAM: Sometimes music calms the savage beast.
You could sing to him.

885
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:55,324
TRAVIS: I would try Intimidating Presence,
but he'll just shrug it off because he's amazing.

886
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:58,607
LIAM: It's fine, it looks like he's going to
rally. Here it comes.

887
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:03,226
TRAVIS: I just take off straight for him.

888
00:42:03,226 --> 00:42:15,334
MATT: Okay, you turn around--(counting) You just
get into melee with him.

889
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:23,436
TRAVIS: Cool. Awesome. I am going to take all
three attacks at Great Weapon Master at him.

890
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:25,385
NOT Reckless.

891
00:42:25,385 --> 00:42:28,850
MATT: Okay! Go and make your attacks at
disadvantage.

892
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,413
LAURA and TRAVIS: Why?!

893
00:42:31,413 --> 00:42:32,999
TRAVIS: Because I'm covered in blood?

894
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:36,375
MATT: No. Because he used his Patient Defense.

895
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,999
SAM: Patient Defense.

896
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:40,557
MATT: Essentially with each blow that you--

897
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:41,636
LAURA: Oh, that's fun.

898
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:43,915
MATT:--swing towards him, he's just prepared
himself from a defensive position, to prepare

899
00:42:43,915 --> 00:42:48,711
himself. And he's using your own momentum against
you to sway every attack away from him. So make

900
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:50,689
all of your attacks at disadvantage.

901
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:55,926
TRAVIS: So that's pretty smart. I threw that
literally into the holder and it was on an edge.

902
00:42:55,926 --> 00:43:03,284
Shit. That's a natural 20 that's going to be
replaced by a not as great (inhales sharply).

903
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:07,941
23 minus five. So, it'll be a dud.

904
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:12,953
MATT: Nope. So the first blow swings wide.
He grabs the actual side of the hammer with both

905
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:16,256
hands and just (whooshes) throws it off to the
side.

906
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:25,150
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 31 minus five. 26.

907
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:25,792
SAM: Ooh.

908
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:29,531
MATT: 26. He attempts to parry this one, however,
your sheer force of strength manages to push past

909
00:43:29,531 --> 00:43:33,312
his grasp, and you bring the hammer down towards
his clavicle. Go ahead and roll damage.

910
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:39,835
TRAVIS: (exhales) Oh, thank god. (high pitched) I
like it when I hit them. (normal voice) That's 28

911
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:45,475
plus enlarge. Which I've been forgetting. 20.

912
00:43:45,475 --> 00:43:50,307
MATT: 20!

913
00:43:50,307 --> 00:43:52,653
LAURA: 18 and 10? Because of your--

914
00:43:52,653 --> 00:43:55,204
TRAVIS: 18 plus 10 for Great Weapon Master. 28.
30.

915
00:43:55,204 --> 00:43:56,793
LAURA: 30? You said 20.

916
00:43:56,793 --> 00:43:58,220
TRAVIS: I said 20 I meant 30.

917
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,176
LAURA: It's 30.

918
00:43:59,176 --> 00:44:00,381
MATT: You mean 30.

919
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:03,165
TRAVIS: My apologies. He is hitting me really,
really hard.

920
00:44:03,165 --> 00:44:06,522
LAURA: Yeah. And your brain is already so little.

921
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:08,926
TRAVIS: It's actually large, it just doesn't do
much.

922
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:10,891
MATT: And if you're using your bonus action,
you can get one more strike in.

923
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:13,167
TRAVIS: I would like to. At disadvantage.

924
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:15,552
MATT: Go for it.

925
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,530
TRAVIS: That's a one.

926
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,749
MATT: Nope. So, the second one does hit the
clavicle, and it cracks and he (grunts).

927
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:26,036
You see a little bit of blood spill out the
corner of his mouth down his chin. And he looks up

928
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:32,759
at you, and for a second there, the whites of his
eyes seem to almost dim ever so slightly into a

929
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:37,378
moment of humanity you haven't seen in him yet.
He's been this godlike entity and this is the

930
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:44,398
first point where you see that pain show just a
hint of any sort of weakening. And he kinda looks

931
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:50,099
right up into you. "Good. Good." And as you go for
your third strike he literally puts up his hand

932
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,396
and (heavy impact) catches the hammer in place.

933
00:44:52,396 --> 00:44:54,228
TRAVIS: Oh, god, it's so awesome!

934
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:58,846
MATT: He just holds it there as he stares at you.

935
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:04,663
TRAVIS: (groans) Yeah, I'm checking reflexes.

936
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:05,799
MATT: Good.

937
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:10,492
TRAVIS: I want you to know I'm not afraid to go
down.

938
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:17,618
MATT: That is the first lesson. Let's see if your
words can be put into practice.

939
00:45:17,618 --> 00:45:20,483
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

940
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:21,708
MARISHA: Good night!

941
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:22,854
LAURA: No! No!

942
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,965
MARISHA: We'll see you in the morning, sleep well
friends.

943
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:29,931
TRAVIS: I hope you get a popcorn kernel in your
teeth.

944
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,002
MATT: He is going to, let's see...

945
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:33,835
LIAM: Go Cobra Kai on your ass.

946
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:34,856
TALIESIN: Cobra Kai.

947
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:36,101
TRAVIS: Sweep the leg, Johnny!

948
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:37,256
TALIESIN: Never dies.

949
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:41,236
LIAM: Put him in a bodybag!

950
00:45:41,236 --> 00:45:47,772
MATT: Yeah, he's going to go into a flurry of
blows against you. That's a natural 20.

951
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:49,393
TRAVIS: (groans)

952
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,442
MATT: That is a 18?

953
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:52,821
TRAVIS: Yeah.

954
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:54,359
MATT: That is a 26.

955
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:55,769
TRAVIS: Okay, all hit!

956
00:45:55,769 --> 00:46:00,644
MATT: Yeah, those all hit, okay. So the first one
is 18, reduced to half, is nine.

957
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:02,294
TRAVIS: Nine, okay.

958
00:46:02,294 --> 00:46:04,849
MATT: That is a nine, reduced to half, five.

959
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,241
TRAVIS: Okay.

960
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:09,438
MATT: That is a 12 reduced to six.

961
00:46:09,438 --> 00:46:10,635
TRAVIS: Okay.

962
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,920
MATT: And that is a 13 reduced to seven.

963
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,253
TRAVIS: Sweet. Real excited.

964
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:20,060
MATT: And he's just going to go ahead and rotate
around you to the opposite side. As he turns

965
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,171
around (punch sounds), hitting you as he goes with
each hit.

966
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:25,925
TRAVIS: (grunts, spurting blood noise)

967
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:32,318
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make a strength
saving throw.

968
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,973
You have advantage on these because
you're raging.

969
00:46:33,973 --> 00:46:36,087
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know. But I still have minus two
to them.

970
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:37,493
MATT: This is true.

971
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:39,806
LAURA: Minus two?

972
00:46:39,806 --> 00:46:41,543
LIAM: It's going to knock the beard off your
face.

973
00:46:41,543 --> 00:46:46,316
TRAVIS: That's better. 23 minus two, 21.

974
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:51,980
MATT: 21, okay, yeah. So, the last blow,
as he comes round (punch noise), does a

975
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,941
roundhouse kick and brings back and goes for a
huge double-fisted

976
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:57,362
kind of earth-side punch into
your torso.

977
00:46:57,362 --> 00:46:58,697
TRAVIS: Not the double fist!

978
00:46:58,697 --> 00:47:00,957
MATT: It's about to push you backward, but you dig
in your feet (grunts)

979
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:02,344
and resist it and hold your place.

980
00:47:02,344 --> 00:47:03,996
LAURA: Yeah!

981
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:08,034
TRAVIS: Look who's catching who now.

982
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,603
MATT: Now it's your turn.

983
00:47:09,603 --> 00:47:18,069
TRAVIS: He didn't have a quip back for me, okay.
Right. I would like to turn so I'm facing him.

984
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:24,204
MATT: Okay.

985
00:47:24,204 --> 00:47:27,654
TRAVIS: I want to pick him up and try and bodyslam
him.

986
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:31,304
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and make an athletics check.

987
00:47:31,304 --> 00:47:37,891
TRAVIS: Okay. 24.

988
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:39,645
MATT: No, that's a 30 acrobatics.

989
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:41,411
(everyone gasps)

990
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:46,416
MATT: You go to grab, and he steps back with his
arms still crossed, leaps onto your hands as you

991
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:52,538
reach out for him, and just jumps in the air,
looks down at you before he comes landing right

992
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:56,632
on top of your hands (bam), forcing your fists
into the dirt.

993
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:58,629
What are you going to do for your
next attack?

994
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:03,943
TRAVIS: I almost drop out of my rage because that
was a real dick move, just dunking on me.

995
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:05,492
LAURA: He's jumping and crossing his arms--

996
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:13,123
TRAVIS: He did the Kill Bill on my hands.
I want to try one more time.

997
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:18,473
MATT: All right, roll again.

998
00:48:18,473 --> 00:48:19,707
TRAVIS: 20.

999
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:23,530
MATT: Remember, you have advantage on these
because you're raging.

1000
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,812
TRAVIS: It doesn't matter.

1001
00:48:24,812 --> 00:48:32,161
MATT: Okay, that's a 24 acrobatics. As you pull
your hands up out of the dirt reaching out for him

1002
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:38,027
with these giant Titanstone gauntlet-encrusted
fingers (groans), and the sand burst goes upwards,

1003
00:48:38,027 --> 00:48:44,830
you reach, and find nothing but sand. And as the
sand fades, he uses his-- Is this the end of your

1004
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,550
turn, because you still have a bonus action.

1005
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,701
TRAVIS: I still have a third one, yeah.

1006
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:50,082
MATT: Okay, so as the sand is still cascading,
now you can see his shape through it, what are

1007
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:52,793
you doing with your third strike?

1008
00:48:52,793 --> 00:48:55,363
TRAVIS: I just want to try and grab a hold of the
slippery bastard.

1009
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:57,004
MATT: Okay, one more time.

1010
00:48:57,004 --> 00:48:59,844
TRAVIS: Yeah. Strength, advantage or just natural
roll?

1011
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:01,157
MATT: Advantage on your athletics.

1012
00:49:01,157 --> 00:49:03,517
TRAVIS: Okay.

1013
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:08,172
LIAM: God, it probably looks like he's running in
circles to us.

1014
00:49:08,172 --> 00:49:09,837
TRAVIS: 26.

1015
00:49:09,837 --> 00:49:11,210
MATT: He only rolled 24.

1016
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,247
LAURA: (gasps)

1017
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:15,833
MATT: With the sand there, kind of coming down
from the impact of you pulling your fists out,

1018
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:20,350
you reach out and finally they find purchase on
the sides of his arms. And doing so, you (boom)

1019
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:24,532
pull him in, and grasp him right to your chest.
The hammer still clutched in your right hand,

1020
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:29,943
and you watch as he (grunts) gets pulled in now,
and he is firmly in your grasp,

1021
00:49:29,943 --> 00:49:31,747
he is currently grappled.

1022
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:34,668
TRAVIS: Cool. I don't say anything, I'm just
really stoked that I actually got him.

1023
00:49:34,668 --> 00:49:36,822
(everyone laughs)

1024
00:49:36,822 --> 00:49:39,126
TRAVIS: I'm like, take a picture! Whatever that
is!

1025
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:43,696
LAURA: Draw it! Draw it! Quick, Percy! Should I
flash him? Should I flash him?

1026
00:49:43,696 --> 00:49:45,054
TALIESIN: It couldn't hurt.

1027
00:49:45,054 --> 00:49:47,496
MATT: You want to make this into a bodyslam?

1028
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:48,248
TRAVIS: Could I?

1029
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:49,108
MARISHA Couldn't hurt the rest of us, either!

1030
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,002
MATT: I'll let you, sure. Okay.

1031
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:55,480
TRAVIS: I was thinking initially I'd like to
remove one of his five hits that he takes on me,

1032
00:49:55,532 --> 00:49:57,993
but, four, who gives a shit.

1033
00:49:57,993 --> 00:50:00,759
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this,
since your intent was to bodyslam him, go ahead

1034
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:02,492
and roll an attack with disadvantage.

1035
00:50:02,492 --> 00:50:08,529
TRAVIS: Okay, attack with disadvantage. That's not
that great. Oh, regular attack!

1036
00:50:08,529 --> 00:50:14,087
MATT: It's without your weapon bonus. It's minus
3.

1037
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:17,173
TRAVIS: Yeah, 22.

1038
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:23,045
MATT: 22. You grab him and you lift, and it's like
he's anchored to the ground. He's much smaller

1039
00:50:23,045 --> 00:50:28,295
than you, and you can lift things far larger and
denser than him, but for some reason, he won't

1040
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:35,137
budge an inch. He's just staring up at you,
with his arms pressed to his sides.

1041
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:37,018
MARISHA: I want to learn that trick.

1042
00:50:37,018 --> 00:50:39,754
TRAVIS: I've still got him grappled at least.
That's it.

1043
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:41,066
MATT: All right.

1044
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:44,287
LAURA: You have to be crouched down in order to be
grappling him?

1045
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:45,313
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1046
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:47,004
MARISHA: It's like the possum trick.

1047
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:51,177
TRAVIS: Let's just assume that I picked him up.
I'm just holding him grappled.

1048
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:52,545
Or am I squatting?

1049
00:50:52,545 --> 00:50:53,888
MATT: You're squatting down and grappling him.

1050
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:56,563
You went to lift him up but (grunts) he wouldn't
budge.

1051
00:50:56,563 --> 00:50:58,467
TRAVIS: Hugging Santa's little helper.

1052
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:01,266
LIAM: He's friggin third Hokage, man. He's not
going anywhere.

1053
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,244
MATT: As you're holding him, he closes his eyes.

1054
00:51:03,244 --> 00:51:04,664
TRAVIS: He closes his eyes?

1055
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:09,227
MATT: And you watch as this kind of warm
orange-ish white energy begins to just emanate--

1056
00:51:09,227 --> 00:51:10,645
LARUA: (gasps) He's going super saiyan!

1057
00:51:10,645 --> 00:51:13,286
MATT: --from various parts in his body. Just here,
in the middle of the forehead a little glimmer

1058
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:15,081
opens here, a little glimmer in the shoulder--

1059
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:16,492
MARISHA: He's over 9000!

1060
00:51:16,492 --> 00:51:19,677
MATT: --his various chakra points begin to glow.
And you watch as many of the bruises and

1061
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:22,931
bludgeons that you put upon his body, and cuts
begin to heal up.

1062
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:25,020
LAURA: Shit.

1063
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,332
LIAM: I want to be at level 21.

1064
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:32,114
SAM: That's 20 more levels.

1065
00:51:32,114 --> 00:51:34,549
LIAM: Four more years of this.

1066
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:46,456
MATT: (laughs) And he can't move, he's currently
grappled. All right, so that's his turn.

1067
00:51:46,456 --> 00:51:47,863
You go ahead.

1068
00:51:47,863 --> 00:51:49,119
TRAVIS: I still have him grappled?

1069
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,302
MATT: You still have him grappled.

1070
00:51:50,302 --> 00:51:53,070
TRAVIS: I still want to try to get him to the
ground. I want to try and get him prone.

1071
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:59,321
Can I try a leg wrap, so I'm gonna wrap my right
leg around his, and dive forward. Trying to push

1072
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:01,773
him off-balance on to his back.

1073
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:03,932
MATT: I'll say go ahead and make another athletics
check.

1074
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:10,923
TRAVIS: Okay. 24.

1075
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:15,555
MATT: 24, he got a 21. So we'll say for this,
you go ahead, you'll be releasing the grapple,

1076
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:20,566
but you slam him on the ground and make him
prone. So you manage to just (grunts) rip him off

1077
00:52:20,566 --> 00:52:24,726
of whatever weird center of gravity he's forced
himself into, lift him over your head, and just

1078
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:26,573
pile-drive him into the ground.

1079
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:27,251
TRAVIS: Great.

1080
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:32,625
MATT: (boom) Once again, you see sand and dust
kick up, and then you see these two legs sticking

1081
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:36,255
up as you've basically planted him in the ground
like a carrot.

1082
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:39,401
And he is currently prone on the
ground, yes.

1083
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:43,528
TRAVIS: Great! When he's prone, do I get advantage
on attacks?

1084
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:46,924
MATT: When he is prone, attack rolls against the
creature have advantage

1085
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:48,815
if you're within five feet, so yes you do.

1086
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:52,637
TRAVIS: Great. Great Weapon Master, dwarven
thrower, and I say

1087
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:55,349
I want to know the answer to the lesson!

1088
00:52:55,349 --> 00:53:04,563
(everyone laughs)

1089
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:07,488
TRAVIS: 29 minus five, 24?

1090
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:08,772
MATT: 24, that hits.

1091
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:09,680
TRAVIS: Okay.

1092
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,175
LIAM: Get him, big man!

1093
00:53:11,175 --> 00:53:15,965
MARISHA: Give him the chair!

1094
00:53:15,965 --> 00:53:19,359
TRAVIS: 35.

1095
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,960
MATT: 35.

1096
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,812
TRAVIS: Plus the enlarge damage.

1097
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:28,054
MATT: Nice! Okay, that's your second attack.

1098
00:53:28,054 --> 00:53:33,815
TRAVIS: Uh, 28 minus five, 23.

1099
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:38,187
MATT: 23 just hits.

1100
00:53:38,187 --> 00:53:46,667
TRAVIS: 9, 24, 34, 38.

1101
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:54,267
MATT: 38, oof! All righty. So as you're shouting
this the first blow comes down (whack), you're not

1102
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:58,843
even seeing him or seeing the impact, all you're
seeing is sand and fury. The second and final

1103
00:53:58,843 --> 00:54:03,366
blow, you bring up, and as you bring it down you
feel something (crack) crack underneath.

1104
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:08,480
And you watch as you pull the hammer up again,
he pushes off, and he's gonna actually use it at

1105
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,973
the end of your turn-- are you going to move?

1106
00:54:10,973 --> 00:54:13,376
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1107
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:15,083
MATT: It's up to you, you can stay where you are.

1108
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:18,240
TRAVIS: No, I would be right there, just entranced
that he's actually in the ground.

1109
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,790
MATT: Okay. So at the end of your turn he's going
to go ahead

1110
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,990
and use a legendary action to attack you.

1111
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,619
TRAVIS: I meant 'I run'!

1112
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:31,685
MATT: It's a 30. So it hits you. All right,
that's 18, halved to nine,

1113
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,538
take nine points of damage.

1114
00:54:33,538 --> 00:54:34,656
TRAVIS: Okay.

1115
00:54:34,656 --> 00:54:42,587
MATT: And I need you to make another constitution
saving throw.

1116
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:46,499
TRAVIS: Okay. Natural 20!

1117
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:53,038
MATT: Sick, okay! As you pull up from the hammer,
you can see now, there's quite a bit of blood now

1118
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:57,705
out of his mouth, and there's a part of the chest
where it's pushed in, and you can see where the

1119
00:54:57,705 --> 00:55:01,962
impact has caused heavy bruising and parts of the
skin have broken open from impact. So now he's

1120
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:04,680
bleeding in places. You're bleeding all over the
place.

1121
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,824
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

1122
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:09,855
MATT: So it's just this mess of two somewhat
dressed humanoid men

1123
00:55:09,855 --> 00:55:11,325
covered in their own blood. It's delightful.

1124
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:12,542
TRAVIS: And blood and sand.

1125
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,489
MATT: Yeah, blood and sand. It's encrusted
everywhere.

1126
00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:18,773
MARISHA: Be careful, that's how blood diseases are
transferred!

1127
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,404
TALIESIN: Very filthy.

1128
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:21,425
MARISHA: Be careful!

1129
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:22,442
SAM: Sepsis!

1130
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:27,107
MATT: He pushes off and manages to hit you in the
sternum once again, the same place where the

1131
00:55:27,107 --> 00:55:32,121
vibrations hit. However this time you grab his
hand as it gets there, and it still hits you,

1132
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:37,363
but the gauntlets absorb the impact and prevent
it from spreading through your body. That ends

1133
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:42,528
your turn. It's now his turn. He stands up from
prone.

1134
00:55:42,528 --> 00:55:44,871
TRAVIS: Goddamn, he did that to me on my turn.

1135
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:45,895
MATT: Yeah.

1136
00:55:45,895 --> 00:55:47,869
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's fucked up.

1137
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:50,443
(everyone laughs)

1138
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:56,088
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Natural 20 on my turn,
saved my life.

1139
00:55:56,088 --> 00:56:02,851
MATT: Okay, he's going to go ahead and hit you
twice (punch sounds). That is an 18?

1140
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:03,992
TRAVIS: Hits.

1141
00:56:03,992 --> 00:56:12,408
MATT: And a 20. So yeah, so the first one--I need
you to make a constitution saving throw.

1142
00:56:12,408 --> 00:56:13,986
TRAVIS: Okay.

1143
00:56:13,986 --> 00:56:18,917
MATT: And you take 14 reduced to half, seven
points of bludgeoning damage.

1144
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,135
TRAVIS: Uh, 13 on my constitution saving throw.

1145
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:22,106
MATT: 13.

1146
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:23,641
TRAVIS: What was the damage? I'm sorry.

1147
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:24,296
MATT: Seven.

1148
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:25,688
TRAVIS: Seven.

1149
00:56:25,688 --> 00:56:28,540
MATT: You feel your muscles lock up once more,
and you're stunned now.

1150
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,532
TRAVIS: Awesome.

1151
00:56:29,532 --> 00:56:34,408
MATT: That allows his attack, and since you are
stunned, attacks against you have advantage,

1152
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:38,598
and you are incapacitated, so hits that are
against you are technically all crits.

1153
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:41,348
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

1154
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:44,890
MATT: So the next hit that went against you is six
plus eight--

1155
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,020
TRAVIS: Can I smile before he hits me?

1156
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,855
MATT: Sure, you go. So you feel as your body locks
up, the next hit (whack) goes right into the same

1157
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:55,251
place where he keeps hitting you in the sternum.
You can feel the bruising, now you hear the

1158
00:56:55,251 --> 00:57:02,194
(crack) crack inward as you feel the cartilage
there pop inward. That's the second hit.

1159
00:57:02,194 --> 00:57:07,782
He goes in for two more strikes now as you're
stunned. (whoof) The next one, the third one,

1160
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:13,611
that's going to be a 27? That is eight plus
eight, you take eight damage because it's halved.

1161
00:57:13,611 --> 00:57:22,864
So take eight bludgeoning damage. And his final
hit, that is going to be a 30. That is going to be

1162
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:26,747
a 6, 12, 20, reduce that to ten bludgeoning
damage.

1163
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,427
TRAVIS: Cool! Great!

1164
00:57:28,427 --> 00:57:30,457
LIAM: Still standing.

1165
00:57:30,457 --> 00:57:38,497
TRAVIS: My math is probably wrong but I'm getting
down there.

1166
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:46,121
MATT: Okay. He's going to stand right there.
Your turn.

1167
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:47,352
TRAVIS: He is.

1168
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:48,457
MATT: Yep.

1169
00:57:48,457 --> 00:57:50,463
LAURA: Oh my god.

1170
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:51,518
MATT: What are you going to do?

1171
00:57:51,518 --> 00:57:53,420
TRAVIS: Did he just stand there, and he had a
turn?

1172
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,746
MATT: He just went. He got up from prone,
that's half his movement, and he's not going to

1173
00:57:57,746 --> 00:58:05,123
move around you, he's staying right where he is.
What do you do?

1174
00:58:05,123 --> 00:58:18,240
MARISHA: Show him what you've learned! None of us
know what you learned though! We can't help you!

1175
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:33,253
TRAVIS: I feel like he's doing that Patient
Defense thing again. Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to

1176
00:58:33,253 --> 00:58:38,828
go for broke. Because we're pretty close anyway.
I'm gonna make

1177
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:43,252
all three attacks reckless, Great Weapon Master.

1178
00:58:43,252 --> 00:58:46,008
MATT: Okay! Go for it.

1179
00:58:46,008 --> 00:58:48,957
LIAM: Tripling down on the barbarian.

1180
00:58:48,957 --> 00:58:51,609
TRAVIS: (laughing) I don't know any better,
I don't know.

1181
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:53,595
MATT: Oh no, actually, you're stunned this turn.

1182
00:58:53,595 --> 00:58:54,446
TRAVIS: Oh!

1183
00:58:54,446 --> 00:58:55,615
MATT: I just remembered that.

1184
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,896
LAURA: Fuck!

1185
00:58:56,896 --> 00:59:00,234
MATT: So, you grin, and then (grunts) your body
just won't respond.

1186
00:59:00,234 --> 00:59:02,248
TRAVIS: Is there a small fart at least?

1187
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:04,423
LIAM: (high-pitched fart noise)

1188
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:05,591
MATT: It's about that.

1189
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:09,696
TRAVIS: Yep. It's not even like something to be
proud of. Just a little squeaker.

1190
00:59:09,696 --> 00:59:12,111
LAURA: Oh, did you just poop your pants?

1191
00:59:12,111 --> 00:59:15,058
LIAM: You turtle a little bit?

1192
00:59:15,058 --> 00:59:20,469
TRAVIS: (Scottish accent) A little turtle head
poking out. (Normal voice) So I'm stunned--

1193
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:24,548
MATT: You're stunned until the end of your turn.
Your turn ends, at the end of your turn he's

1194
00:59:24,548 --> 00:59:27,528
going to use one of his legendary actions to use
Like The Wind, and he gets to move his speed

1195
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:32,984
without attacks of opportunity.

1196
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:36,399
LAURA: What does he want from you?

1197
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:38,315
TALIESIN: For you to show him what you learned.

1198
00:59:38,315 --> 00:59:40,657
MATT: He just (whoosh) slips back and he's on the
opposite side, and just goes.

1199
00:59:40,657 --> 00:59:46,223
TRAVIS: Cool. I look back, and do this.

1200
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:48,802
SAM: Ooh! He learned to be a dick!

1201
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:54,012
(everyone laughs)

1202
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:55,369
MATT: That's your turn?

1203
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:56,270
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1204
00:59:56,270 --> 01:00:05,384
MATT: Okay. He begins to rotate. Over there...
and that's his turn.

1205
01:00:05,453 --> 01:00:08,355
SAM: You have a healing--

1206
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:12,182
MARISHA: Everyone is doing their Keanu
impressions.

1207
01:00:12,182 --> 01:00:13,709
TRAVIS: I have no healing anythings.

1208
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:14,539
SAM: Awesome.

1209
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:16,931
TRAVIS: I do if I
short rest, but that's it. All right--

1210
01:00:16,931 --> 01:00:18,435
SAM: Ooh, take one.

1211
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:19,731
LIAM: I do to Keyleth.

1212
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:22,743
TRAVIS: How
far can I throw this fucking thing? Long range of

1213
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:27,652
60 feet. The long range of 60 feet means that it
would be a disadvantage throw?

1214
01:00:27,652 --> 01:00:30,262
MATT: Correct.

1215
01:00:30,262 --> 01:00:32,587
TRAVIS: That's not great.

1216
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,424
MATT: Short range
is 20?

1217
01:00:34,424 --> 01:00:35,987
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1218
01:00:35,987 --> 01:00:38,105
MATT: Just get up within 20 feet of him.

1219
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:42,145
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's be honest.
Could I get to him in 50 feet?

1220
01:00:42,145 --> 01:00:43,903
MATT: You wanna try?

1221
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:45,608
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to try.

1222
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:58,614
MATT: (counting) You just barely get up to him.

1223
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:02,779
TRAVIS: God! I just wanna keep staring back at
him but I don't-- There's no point to it.

1224
01:01:02,779 --> 01:01:06,296
I can't do anything. It's not like I can psych
him out or--

1225
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:07,866
LAURA: Tell him what you learned!

1226
01:01:07,866 --> 01:01:11,575
(all laugh)

1227
01:01:11,575 --> 01:01:12,722
MATT: What are you gonna
do?

1228
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:14,526
SAM: Vague words of encouragement!

1229
01:01:14,526 --> 01:01:16,327
(all laugh)

1230
01:01:16,327 --> 01:01:18,877
TRAVIS: Yeah, going for broke again.
Reckless, great weapon master, all three.

1231
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:19,534
MATT: Okay.

1232
01:01:19,534 --> 01:01:20,256
TRAVIS: Okay.

1233
01:01:20,256 --> 01:01:21,778
MATT: You have
disadvantage on them because of his Patient

1234
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,791
Defense, so they're just straight rolls.

1235
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:25,921
TRAVIS: Spatial-- Patient Defense.

1236
01:01:25,921 --> 01:01:27,757
MATT: Patient Defense, yes.

1237
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:30,640
TRAVIS: Also known as
spatial defense in the barbarian world.

1238
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,442
LAURA: Totally. (gasps)

1239
01:01:33,442 --> 01:01:35,078
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1240
01:01:35,078 --> 01:01:36,044
MARISHA: Ooh.

1241
01:01:36,044 --> 01:01:37,321
MATT: Okay.

1242
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:38,895
LIAM: Just two more of those, please.

1243
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:52,533
TRAVIS: So I double the damage die-- or I 
roll two more damage dice after this.

1244
01:01:52,533 --> 01:01:55,233
LAURA: Are you supposed to roll
10's or 12's?

1245
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:56,471
MATT: 10's for the hammer.

1246
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:57,221
LAURA: Okay.

1247
01:01:57,221 --> 01:02:01,861
TRAVIS: 42.

1248
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:04,415
MATT: 42 points of
damage on the first one, ooh.

1249
01:02:04,415 --> 01:02:05,960
LAURA: (quietly) That's good, that's good.

1250
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,145
TRAVIS: Second one.

1251
01:02:07,145 --> 01:02:11,793
MATT: Second attack.

1252
01:02:11,964 --> 01:02:13,883
TRAVIS: That's a 31 minus five, 26?

1253
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:15,797
MATT: 26 hits.

1254
01:02:15,797 --> 01:02:22,626
TRAVIS: (counting) 35.

1255
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:23,618
MATT: 35 points
of damage?

1256
01:02:23,618 --> 01:02:24,515
TRAVIS: Yep.

1257
01:02:24,515 --> 01:02:25,609
MATT: Oof.

1258
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:26,458
TRAVIS: Last one.

1259
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,601
LAURA, SAM, and MARISHA: (clap)

1260
01:02:27,601 --> 01:02:29,076
MATT: Last attack.

1261
01:02:29,076 --> 01:02:38,103
TRAVIS: I'm buying a ticket to the
no pants dance after this. 20, 22.

1262
01:02:38,103 --> 01:02:39,320
MATT: 22, no.

1263
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,319
LAURA: (groan)

1264
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,096
TRAVIS: Oh no no, that's not
minus five-- it is minus five.

1265
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:44,062
MATT: Yeah,
it is minus five. So, you go bounding up towards

1266
01:02:44,062 --> 01:02:49,440
him (boom boom boom). He just sits there waiting,
his arms up. The first strike, he goes to parry

1267
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,018
but as you hit (crack), his arm gets knocked out
of the way, preventing him from parrying the

1268
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:57,410
second strike as it comes down right across the
side of the face (boof), hitting him, you watch as

1269
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:02,595
blood (splattering sound) across the sand and you
see his jaw's kinda momentarily dislodged,

1270
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:06,863
his beard just kinda crusted in his own blood.
As you come up with a giant over-the-head blow

1271
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:11,982
and as it comes down, he (crack) slaps it from
both sides and stops it mid-action. You see his

1272
01:03:11,982 --> 01:03:16,036
hands shaking as he's holding it, and he just
kinda looks up in your face,

1273
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:18,875
"Good. Good."

1274
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,688
TRAVIS: You keep saying that!

1275
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:23,196
LIAM: That
was so metal.

1276
01:03:23,196 --> 01:03:27,645
MATT: It's now his turn. As he throws the hammer
back over your head, which puts you off-balance,

1277
01:03:27,645 --> 01:03:34,971
he's gonna go into his first two strikes. The
first one is a 21 to hit?

1278
01:03:34,971 --> 01:03:37,376
TRAVIS: (strained) Yes, I believe that hits.

1279
01:03:37,376 --> 01:03:40,244
MATT: That is gonna be ten, reduced to five.

1280
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:40,931
TRAVIS: Okay.

1281
01:03:40,931 --> 01:03:48,547
MATT: Second one, uh-- on the first one, I need
you to make another constitution saving throw.

1282
01:03:48,547 --> 01:03:49,687
TRAVIS: Okay, same damage?

1283
01:03:49,687 --> 01:03:50,724
MATT: Same damage, yeah.

1284
01:03:50,724 --> 01:03:51,650
TRAVIS: Okay.

1285
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:53,233
MATT: But he's gonna do--

1286
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:54,070
TRAVIS: 23.

1287
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:54,649
MATT: 23.

1288
01:03:54,649 --> 01:03:55,841
TRAVIS: Nope, 21.

1289
01:03:55,841 --> 01:04:00,457
MATT: 21, that's right, yeah. So you manage
to resist, the effect of the stunning strike.

1290
01:04:00,457 --> 01:04:02,222
He's gonna go for the secondary attack.

1291
01:04:02,222 --> 01:04:03,277
TRAVIS: Okay.

1292
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:06,157
MATT: Which was seven plus 13,
it's 20, so that still hits you.

1293
01:04:06,157 --> 01:04:07,110
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1294
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,868
MATT: You take 18, reduce that to nine.

1295
01:04:09,868 --> 01:04:11,575
TRAVIS: Oof (laughs).

1296
01:04:11,575 --> 01:04:13,873
MATT: Make another
constitution saving throw.

1297
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:16,580
TRAVIS: Cool (laughs). We in the single digits,
kids.

1298
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,776
(all gasp)

1299
01:04:18,776 --> 01:04:19,759
MARISHA: (quietly) No.

1300
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:21,391
TRAVIS: 22 minus two is 20.

1301
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,112
MATT: 20, you just barely shrug off
the effect of the stunning strike.

1302
01:04:23,112 --> 01:04:24,627
(all sigh in relief)

1303
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,096
SAM: Clutch.

1304
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,978
MATT: He is gonna go in for his flurry of blows 
'cause he knows you're on the edge.

1305
01:04:29,978 --> 01:04:31,355
LAURA: No!

1306
01:04:31,355 --> 01:04:32,728
MATT: He knows you're on
the edge.

1307
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:34,038
SAM: He just has to miss four.

1308
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:35,119
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

1309
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,082
MATT: That's a
natural 20.

1310
01:04:36,082 --> 01:04:37,221
(all gasp)

1311
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:38,002
MARISHA: No.

1312
01:04:38,002 --> 01:04:38,752
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1313
01:04:38,752 --> 01:04:40,219
SAM: Just has to miss three.

1314
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:45,410
MATT:That is 16 plus 8, that is 24 points of damage
reduced to half to 12.

1315
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:52,044
TRAVIS: I am unconscious,
but! I use my relentless rage.

1316
01:04:52,044 --> 01:04:53,072
SAM: (growls)

1317
01:04:53,072 --> 01:04:54,611
MATT: Right! Oh shit, okay.

1318
01:04:54,611 --> 01:04:56,282
MARISHA: You're coming back.

1319
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:57,539
MATT: I forgot about that.

1320
01:04:57,539 --> 01:04:59,194
TRAVIS: Which, it's a flurry of blows,
and he only did it on the first one.

1321
01:04:59,194 --> 01:05:00,247
(all laugh)

1322
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:04,546
TRAVIS: So, I'm like (long groan,
rewind noise) Oh shit! (long groan).

1323
01:05:04,546 --> 01:05:05,552
(all laugh)

1324
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:07,480
MATT: Well, you need to make a
constitution saving throw.

1325
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,349
TRAVIS: I do, yes.

1326
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:09,326
MATT: The DC of 10.

1327
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:10,257
TRAVIS: I do.

1328
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:11,129
MARISHA: C'mon.

1329
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:12,230
SAM: Phillip!

1330
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,857
TRAVIS: If I can't make a DC of 10, I don't know.

1331
01:05:13,857 --> 01:05:14,914
LAURA: Go Phillip!

1332
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:15,662
LIAM: Phil!

1333
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:16,938
TRAVIS: Uh, 21.

1334
01:05:16,938 --> 01:05:20,816
MATT: Okay, so the third hit, the first couple
just kinda loosen you up (pop pop)--

1335
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,640
TRAVIS: This is gonna get interesting.

1336
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,100
MATT: The third hit, he leaps in the
air, kinda Troy style (whack)

1337
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,886
and hits you right square in the face--

1338
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:28,827
LAURA: Superman
punch!

1339
01:05:28,827 --> 01:05:30,875
MATT: -- up in the air and (ringing punch sound)
you kinda pull back as you feel

1340
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:34,910
your vision
begin to darken, and then you feel that surge of

1341
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:39,007
white hot rage in the back of your skull (crack)
bring you back, and you (grunt) pull back up as he

1342
01:05:39,007 --> 01:05:45,018
lands, and you watch as his expression goes (huff)
and he darts downward and goes for a low to high

1343
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:48,181
ground uppercut dragon punch style.

1344
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:50,351
LIAM: Look out, Guile, look out.

1345
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:51,343
MARISHA: Oh god.

1346
01:05:51,343 --> 01:05:53,686
MATT: That's gonna-- oh, that's an 18 plus 13,
that's a 31.

1347
01:05:53,686 --> 01:05:54,912
(all groan)

1348
01:05:54,912 --> 01:05:56,653
MATT: You take nine points, reduced to five.

1349
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,098
TRAVIS: (electronic
shut down noise)

1350
01:05:58,098 --> 01:05:58,780
LAURA: No!

1351
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,815
(all laugh)

1352
01:05:59,815 --> 01:06:01,826
MATT: (boom) Hits you right underneath the chin,
now make--

1353
01:06:01,826 --> 01:06:04,671
TRAVIS: However, I use my relentless rage, now at
a DC 15.

1354
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,477
MATT: Correct.

1355
01:06:05,477 --> 01:06:06,942
SAM: Whaat?

1356
01:06:06,942 --> 01:06:07,910
LAURA: Ooh, shit.

1357
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,057
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

1358
01:06:09,057 --> 01:06:10,397
LAURA: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon.

1359
01:06:10,397 --> 01:06:11,697
LIAM: Game that system, do it.

1360
01:06:11,697 --> 01:06:12,506
SAM: Come on, come on.

1361
01:06:12,506 --> 01:06:13,930
LIAM: Pull out a squeaker, Travis,
c'mon.

1362
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:14,533
TRAVIS: 27.

1363
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,744
SAM: Ohh!

1364
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:16,532
MARISHA: (claps)

1365
01:06:16,532 --> 01:06:16,993
LAURA: (cackles)

1366
01:06:16,993 --> 01:06:18,440
MATT: 27. As it knocks you into the air, 
almost onto

1367
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,266
your feet but you manage to catch yourself and
(groans) right back up as he lands (cracks) turns

1368
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:23,948
around and looks at you and goes,

1369
01:06:23,948 --> 01:06:25,889
TRAVIS:
Good?

1370
01:06:25,889 --> 01:06:27,536
MATT: "I see what you've learned."

1371
01:06:27,536 --> 01:06:28,827
(all laugh)

1372
01:06:28,827 --> 01:06:29,991
MATT: It's your turn.

1373
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:30,701
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

1374
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:31,449
MATT: It's your turn.

1375
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:32,539
SAM: Kill him.

1376
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:36,611
TRAVIS: All three, reckless, great weapon
master! Chewing my tongue off while I do it!

1377
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:37,646
(all laugh)

1378
01:06:37,646 --> 01:06:38,972
MATT: Go for it.

1379
01:06:38,972 --> 01:06:40,927
LIAM: (deep voice) Show
me what you've learned.

1380
01:06:40,927 --> 01:06:42,452
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (deep voice)
Show me--

1381
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:44,765
TRAVIS: 29 minus five, 24.

1382
01:06:44,765 --> 01:06:46,674
MATT: 24 hits.

1383
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:55,790
TRAVIS: Yep. So the first one is... 23, 33, 34.
34 points of damage, first one.

1384
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:56,784
MATT: Okay.

1385
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:59,229
TRAVIS: Second one, nine, damn it.

1386
01:06:59,229 --> 01:07:00,982
TALIESIN: (high-pitched
groan)

1387
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:04,070
MARISHA: (whispering) Kill him.

1388
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,219
LAURA: 22.

1389
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:06,905
TRAVIS: No, but it's minus five so it's
20.

1390
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:07,685
MATT: 20.

1391
01:07:07,761 --> 01:07:08,700
TRAVIS: Misses.

1392
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:11,156
MATT: So the first one hits (whack), it hits him

1393
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:13,444
in the side of
the head, the other side, it rights his jaw

1394
01:07:13,444 --> 01:07:18,280
strangely but knocks him down onto three points.
He's down on his hand and his two knees in the

1395
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,425
ground, his other arm's still up, clenched in a
fist.

1396
01:07:20,425 --> 01:07:22,954
He's breathing heavily, like he's on the edge.

1397
01:07:22,954 --> 01:07:23,695
TRAVIS: Oh.

1398
01:07:23,695 --> 01:07:24,815
MATT: Second strike,
you go--

1399
01:07:24,815 --> 01:07:25,986
LAURA: Get him, Grog!

1400
01:07:25,986 --> 01:07:26,912
MATT: -- to swing down and he rolls out
of the way

1401
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:29,883
(fwish, crack), hits the ground with no effect.
You're going for your third and final strike.

1402
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:30,604
TRAVIS: I am, yeah.

1403
01:07:30,604 --> 01:07:31,185
MATT: Go for it

1404
01:07:31,185 --> 01:07:32,099
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

1405
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:33,596
LAURA: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

1406
01:07:33,596 --> 01:07:36,421
TRAVIS: (strained) That's pretty good. That's a
30, minus five is 25.

1407
01:07:36,421 --> 01:07:37,981
MATT: 25
hits. Roll damage.

1408
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:39,180
(all cheer)

1409
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,111
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

1410
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:44,092
TRAVIS: Fuck you, Master Splinter.

1411
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:46,262
LIAM: Oh man, Vax is just--

1412
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,772
TRAVIS: Yeah, I haven't forgotten
it now--

1413
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,252
LIAM: -- perched on the wall, pulling feathers
out.

1414
01:07:49,252 --> 01:07:52,529
TRAVIS: -- 23, 33, 37.

1415
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:53,024
LAURA:
Oh!

1416
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:54,536
MATT: Okay, how do you want to do this?

1417
01:07:54,536 --> 01:08:02,066
(all cheer and clap)

1418
01:08:02,066 --> 01:08:03,578
LIAM: That was Vox Machina's
real reaction.

1419
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:05,348
TRAVIS: Okay, so the first one hits, right?

1420
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:08,277
MATT: The first one hits, the second one, he
rolls out of the way and you pull back--

1421
01:08:08,277 --> 01:08:14,676
TRAVIS: Right, I reach back for the third
one and I go, who's good now? (whack)

1422
01:08:14,676 --> 01:08:20,025
MATT: (crack) You guys watch as he knocks 
him clean 15 feet in the air

1423
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:24,739
from the blast of the blow. He ends up 
landing on top and the outside--

1424
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:25,845
TRAVIS: Yes! (laughs)

1425
01:08:25,845 --> 01:08:31,324
MATT: -- of the arena (boom) landing strewn across
the steps that lead to the edge of the sand pit,

1426
01:08:31,324 --> 01:08:34,936
and there's just quiet in the chamber.

1427
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:36,649
TRAVIS: (heavy
breathing)

1428
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:38,764
MATT: As he stands there breathing heavily,
covered in blood.

1429
01:08:38,764 --> 01:08:44,649
There's spatters of blood all across the sand and 
Groon's just lying there, unconscious, breathing.

1430
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:47,999
LAURA: We're just
screaming our asses off.

1431
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,868
MATT: You guys are yelling.

1432
01:08:48,868 --> 01:08:49,771
MARISHA: Aaaah!

1433
01:08:49,771 --> 01:08:53,049
TRAVIS: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Stay there.

1434
01:08:53,049 --> 01:08:56,126
LAURA: What?

1435
01:08:56,126 --> 01:08:58,907
MATT: At this point, there's the opening at
the top of the temple.

1436
01:08:58,907 --> 01:08:59,797
TRAVIS: Right.

1437
01:08:59,797 --> 01:09:13,571
MATT: There's... a rumbling sound, a
(rumble), from up above. And there's a small spark

1438
01:09:13,571 --> 01:09:17,470
of energy that (cracks) up above, (cracks) streaks
down and hits Groon--

1439
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,676
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasp)

1440
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:24,652
MATT: -- like a very faint lightning bolt,
just (pfft) out of the sky and Groon rises up on

1441
01:09:24,652 --> 01:09:34,166
the side, his eyes just vibrant bright, almost
glowing, and he stands back up, and he's still

1442
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:40,940
covered in his own blood, he's wrecked. You can
see parts of his body where the muscle is swollen,

1443
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:46,969
one arm appears to be almost ruined, but he lands
right in front of you.

1444
01:09:46,969 --> 01:09:48,532
TRAVIS: Little bit of pee comes out.

1445
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:49,734
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1446
01:09:49,734 --> 01:09:52,564
LAURA: (laughs)
Everybody's peeing.

1447
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:55,343
LIAM: Join the party.

1448
01:09:55,343 --> 01:10:01,528
MATT: "You've learned much... and Kord smiles
upon you."

1449
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:09,569
As you look up and you hear the roiling again,
and two bolts come streaming out of the top of

1450
01:10:09,569 --> 01:10:15,730
the temple down towards Grog. And slamming into
your body, you instinctually pull down and hunker,

1451
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:20,514
as an animal in a thunderstorm would, but you
feel the warmth as your gauntlets all of a sudden

1452
01:10:20,514 --> 01:10:26,854
flash with electrical energy. And you look down as
the runes on all the sides, and the chains are now

1453
01:10:26,854 --> 01:10:30,506
glowing with divine energy.

1454
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:34,113
SAM: You're a magician!

1455
01:10:34,113 --> 01:10:36,208
TRAVIS: Awesome!

1456
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:40,778
MATT: As the roiling kinda comes to a close you
hear the (thunder noises) of thunder begin to

1457
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:48,622
subside, and you feel the smell of burnt sky and
ozone around you begin to subside, still looking

1458
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:52,648
down at the energy pulsing through the gauntlets.
Groon is still standing there,

1459
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:56,458
looking up at you, and just goes:

1460
01:10:56,458 --> 01:11:01,039
"Continue with your journey."

1461
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:04,165
And just looks at you, waiting for some kind of
response.

1462
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:13,991
TRAVIS: I walk over to him. I bow. And then I
reach out one of the Titanstone Knuckles.

1463
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:17,012
Kord's strength to you.

1464
01:11:17,012 --> 01:11:22,024
MATT: And (slamming noise) slams and pulls you in,
and with an intensity you feel his fingers crack,

1465
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:28,595
even through these newly-imbued gauntlets you feel
the tension as his grip is still, strangely...

1466
01:11:28,595 --> 01:11:33,438
You expect he could be powerful enough to crush
the gauntlet with his bare fingers. He just pulls

1467
01:11:33,438 --> 01:11:38,515
you in from your giant form. The strength is
immense and you (grunt) kinda pull down into his

1468
01:11:38,515 --> 01:11:42,557
form. He looks you straight up, face to face,
but an inch away.

1469
01:11:42,557 --> 01:11:52,570
"What have you learned?"

1470
01:11:52,570 --> 01:12:04,819
TRAVIS: That without the love of my friends,
life has no meaning, and I would be nothing.

1471
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:10,159
MATT: And how will you utilize this knowledge?

1472
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:18,567
TRAVIS: I will make their strength mine,
and my strength their own, and in turn,

1473
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:25,390
I will try to make the world a better place than
I found it.

1474
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:30,753
MATT: His grip pulls off, and he withdraws his
arm, and he releases you

1475
01:12:30,753 --> 01:12:32,542
back to your full standing pose.

1476
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:39,024
Now, at your enlarged form, gargantuan in the
center of this temple space, his once very

1477
01:12:39,024 --> 01:12:48,412
intimidating form, diminutive by comparison to
Grog's full structure, looks up and nods.

1478
01:12:48,412 --> 01:12:51,736
"I thank you."

1479
01:12:51,736 --> 01:12:53,674
GROG: I mean, I really-- I thank you.

1480
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:55,293
(all laugh)

1481
01:12:55,358 --> 01:13:00,522
TRAVIS: I've never gone that far in a battle
before. I didn't even know that was possible.

1482
01:13:00,522 --> 01:13:04,718
This was incredible. I'm talking a lot,
aren't I? I have a bit of a man crush--

1483
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:06,297
MATT: Yes. Yes you are.

1484
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:15,065
TRAVIS: Okay. Uh. Thank you.

1485
01:13:15,128 --> 01:13:19,425
And I turn, and I walk back to my friends.

1486
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:24,844
MATT: As you make your way back, Groon steps and
leaps back out onto the opposite side, and you can

1487
01:13:24,844 --> 01:13:33,303
see, on the opposite end of the platform,
of the sand pit, there is a silver, somewhat

1488
01:13:33,303 --> 01:13:40,141
tarnished, but still functional, bell. And he
walks over to the side of it, grabs the rope,

1489
01:13:40,141 --> 01:13:48,850
and just-- (tolling of a low bell). And you
watch, from all the different corners of the empty

1490
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:54,454
temple, all the priests of Kord begin to wander
back in, who had exited previously, as was the

1491
01:13:54,454 --> 01:13:57,566
request, it seems, of Earthbreaker Groon,
knowing that you were coming.

1492
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,499
LAURA: (whispers) Oh my gosh.

1493
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:04,260
MATT: They all just silently enter and kind of nod
and bow in your direction as you make your way

1494
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,584
towards your friends. You acknowledge it,
but it doesn't slow you, doesn't stop you,

1495
01:14:07,584 --> 01:14:09,808
they are still your focus. And you guys watch as

1496
01:14:09,808 --> 01:14:13,470
Grog approaches, bloodied, beaten, barely 
conscious,

1497
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:18,189
one eye, the lid is kinda drooping a bit.
And even though he's strong in his stride,

1498
01:14:18,189 --> 01:14:22,912
there's still a shake with his knees, but he
doesn't show that weakness. He keeps pushing

1499
01:14:22,912 --> 01:14:26,053
towards you with a slight smile through his
bearded face.

1500
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:33,461
TRAVIS: Guys-- (cough) if we could just make our
way out of here, in as cool a way as possible...

1501
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:37,763
If I fall, just pick me up like Weekend at
Bernie's, okay?

1502
01:14:37,763 --> 01:14:39,301
(all laugh)

1503
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:43,669
LAURA: Pike stands next to him and says,
Don't worry, you won't fall. And she casts, um,

1504
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:45,410
Cure-- whatever, fucking--

1505
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,118
(all laugh)

1506
01:14:47,118 --> 01:14:48,571
LAURA: I don't fucking know what the spell is.

1507
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:49,791
MATT: Cure, Cure Things!

1508
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:50,801
LAURA: I'm not even looking at them-- Cure--

1509
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:51,766
MATT: You have the spell!

1510
01:14:51,766 --> 01:14:53,008
LAURA: He-- no, no, no, I gave them back to
Ashley!

1511
01:14:53,008 --> 01:14:53,853
MATT: No, I mean--

1512
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:54,573
TRAVIS: Vex.

1513
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,878
MATT: Vex has the spell.

1514
01:14:55,878 --> 01:14:57,964
LAURA: Yeah, but as Pike, Cure-- okay, but Pike,
she can do it better than Vex can.

1515
01:14:57,964 --> 01:14:59,511
TRAVIS: You have the spell!

1516
01:14:59,511 --> 01:15:05,586
MATT: Sure, I rolled it for you. You heal eight
hit points.

1517
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:08,335
LAURA: That way you're standing and you don't have
to wobble out.

1518
01:15:08,335 --> 01:15:09,759
TRAVIS: I'm back at nine.

1519
01:15:09,759 --> 01:15:12,172
LIAM: Let's get you some ale, big man.

1520
01:15:12,172 --> 01:15:15,437
TRAVIS: That sounds great.

1521
01:15:15,437 --> 01:15:16,227
LAURA: Grog.

1522
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:17,183
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1523
01:15:17,183 --> 01:15:18,598
LAURA: That was fucking amazing.

1524
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:20,279
TRAVIS: Right? I mean, I got struck by lightning,
guys.

1525
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:22,667
LAURA: Wait! Look at your gauntlets!

1526
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:23,204
TRAVIS: What?

1527
01:15:23,204 --> 01:15:25,278
LAURA: They're glowing!

1528
01:15:25,278 --> 01:15:26,625
TRAVIS: Oh shit, they are.

1529
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:27,827
LAURA: What does it mean?

1530
01:15:27,827 --> 01:15:29,821
MARISHA: Is that lightning available to you all
the time?

1531
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:34,866
(all yell)

1532
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:36,389
SAM: Piece of paper.

1533
01:15:36,389 --> 01:15:39,794
LIAM: Just for clarification, that all took place
in Super Nintendo graphics, right?

1534
01:15:39,794 --> 01:15:41,006
MATT: Oh, yeah.

1535
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:42,081
LIAM: 16-bit.

1536
01:15:42,081 --> 01:15:46,625
MARISHA: As we walk out, Keyleth throws a little
gust cantrip to kick up the dust behind us.

1537
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:51,059
It just looks really dusty and epic as we walk
off into the sunset.

1538
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:54,904
MATT: As you guys walk off, the silhouetted
most-of-Vox-Machina with one giant Grog form

1539
01:15:54,904 --> 01:16:01,157
stepping through. You exit the Trial Forge into
the rest of Vasselheim. We'll take a break there.

1540
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:02,200
TRAVIS: Wow.

1541
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,933
LAURA: What's it do, what's it do?

1542
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:06,258
MATT: Yeah, what does it do?

1543
01:16:06,258 --> 01:16:13,917
TRAVIS: In its Exalted form, my strength now
becomes 26, so plus eight, right?

1544
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:15,046
MATT: Yeah.

1545
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:19,726
TRAVIS: And when I use Enlarge now, I gain
resistance to

1546
01:16:19,726 --> 01:16:24,255
fire, cold, lightning, for ten minutes.

1547
01:16:24,255 --> 01:16:27,117
LAURA: Oh shit, imagine if we had done that before
we went after the dragons.

1548
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:29,406
LIAM: You should've fought that guy before the
dragons.

1549
01:16:29,406 --> 01:16:30,536
TRAVIS: Hey, you know?

1550
01:16:30,536 --> 01:16:32,496
(all laugh)

1551
01:16:32,496 --> 01:16:35,121
TRAVIS: A little drama's good for everybody.

1552
01:16:35,121 --> 01:16:37,577
LIAM: You barely eked out that victory, by the
way.

1553
01:16:37,577 --> 01:16:39,051
TRAVIS: I know, and double damage.

1554
01:16:39,051 --> 01:16:40,123
MARISHA: Wait, fire, lightning, and what?

1555
01:16:40,123 --> 01:16:41,107
TRAVIS: And cold.

1556
01:16:41,107 --> 01:16:44,414
MARISHA: Lightning, fire, and cold, and double
damage?

1557
01:16:44,414 --> 01:16:45,476
TRAVIS: Yeah, so --

1558
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:46,835
MATT: Well, not double damage.

1559
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,225
TRAVIS: Double damage on objects and structures.

1560
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:50,627
MATT: He had that previously.

1561
01:16:50,627 --> 01:16:57,539
TRAVIS: But that's a lot of resistance to a lot of
things. And 26 is... that's really strong.

1562
01:16:57,539 --> 01:17:01,217
MATT: 26 is good. It's two more than what you had,
so everything goes up plus one damage to hit.

1563
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:03,232
LAURA: Damn.

1564
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:06,852
LIAM: My armor does that too, but it only makes me
smell bad, it doesn't affect me.

1565
01:17:06,852 --> 01:17:09,528
TRAVIS: That was awesome.

1566
01:17:09,528 --> 01:17:13,324
MATT: All right, guys. We're gonna take a quick
break, hit the restroom, get some snacks,

1567
01:17:13,324 --> 01:17:20,146
and we'll be back here in a few minutes.
Thank you again. See you in a second.

1568
01:17:20,146 --> 01:38:09,756
[break]

1569
01:38:09,825 --> 01:38:12,895
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back to Critical
Role.

1570
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:14,328
(all laugh)

1571
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:19,043
MATT: So, picking up where we left off, Vox
Machina is now exiting the Trial Forge into the

1572
01:38:19,043 --> 01:38:26,736
Braving Grounds, Grog with the recently reinforced
Titanstone Gauntlets by the strength of Kord

1573
01:38:26,736 --> 01:38:31,134
through your duel with Earthbreaker Groon.

1574
01:38:31,134 --> 01:38:32,089
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1575
01:38:32,089 --> 01:38:32,756
LAURA: Sick!

1576
01:38:32,756 --> 01:38:35,343
MARISHA: What do they do Grog? What do they do?

1577
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:39,617
TRAVIS: I dunno. You know what, we'll probably
have to fight somebody to find out, let's find

1578
01:38:39,617 --> 01:38:41,768
the first person outside of here.

1579
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,365
MARISHA: Well, I mean, okay

1580
01:38:43,365 --> 01:38:44,725
SAM: Sure to one-hit them.

1581
01:38:44,725 --> 01:38:46,387
LAURA: Maybe we can find an old building and you
can just destroy it.

1582
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:47,589
TRAVIS: I'm at nine.

1583
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:48,688
TALIESIN: It's just a kitten going-- (mimes
punching a kitten)

1584
01:38:48,688 --> 01:38:49,670
LIAM: Old woman!

1585
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:50,578
MATT: Red mist.

1586
01:38:50,578 --> 01:38:52,085
(all laugh)

1587
01:38:52,085 --> 01:38:53,599
TRAVIS: (exploding noises) Oh shit.

1588
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:55,428
MARISHA: And that's how Grog was beaten to death
by a purse.

1589
01:38:55,428 --> 01:38:57,841
TALIESIN: It is technically one point. He may go
down.

1590
01:38:57,841 --> 01:38:59,669
MARISHA: Yeah, an old lady trying to cross the
street and takes out Grog.

1591
01:38:59,669 --> 01:39:01,343
TRAVIS: I'm at nine hit points.

1592
01:39:01,343 --> 01:39:03,073
TALIESIN: Nine hit points?

1593
01:39:03,073 --> 01:39:06,438
LIAM: He did just take down an old man so our
streak against the elderly is going strong.

1594
01:39:06,438 --> 01:39:08,073
(all laugh)

1595
01:39:08,073 --> 01:39:09,855
MARISHA: You have the hit points of a kitten right
now.

1596
01:39:09,855 --> 01:39:13,141
TRAVIS: Right, well, I do-- I am fond of cats.

1597
01:39:13,141 --> 01:39:18,213
MATT: I'm pretty sure a kitten has less hit points
than that.

1598
01:39:18,213 --> 01:39:19,207
MARISHA: Yeah, like five.

1599
01:39:19,207 --> 01:39:20,234
TALIESIN: Five.

1600
01:39:20,234 --> 01:39:23,362
MATT: Who would've had a level one character with
less hit points then a kitten. That would be the

1601
01:39:23,362 --> 01:39:24,550
saddest thing ever.

1602
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:26,487
(all laugh)

1603
01:39:26,487 --> 01:39:29,475
TALIESIN: We worked it out at one point.
We worked out the math at one point.

1604
01:39:29,527 --> 01:39:30,135
MARISHA: Yeah.

1605
01:39:30,135 --> 01:39:33,584
LIAM: Five is way too many. At level one you can
have five hit points as a person.

1606
01:39:33,584 --> 01:39:35,318
TALIESIN: It's like two hit points, it's going to
be a very tough kitten.

1607
01:39:35,318 --> 01:39:36,580
LIAM: It'd be like 0.1.

1608
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,512
MARISHA: I mean if you're a wizard.

1609
01:39:37,581 --> 01:39:42,037
MATT: What we're saying is 'kitten' is the
baseline hit point counter in Dungeons and

1610
01:39:42,037 --> 01:39:44,331
Dragons, everybody.

1611
01:39:44,331 --> 01:39:47,953
SAM: Can we count hit points in kitten strength
for now?

1612
01:39:47,953 --> 01:39:50,565
MATT: All right, I'm going to use three hit dice,
I'm at 12 kittens.

1613
01:39:50,565 --> 01:39:55,648
LIAM: Jewels, gems, golds and kittens.

1614
01:39:55,797 --> 01:39:58,837
And that's what the air machines run on.

1615
01:39:59,021 --> 01:40:03,133
TRAVIS: Man. Thanks for not jumping in on that.
It was very personal.

1616
01:40:03,133 --> 01:40:04,543
LAURA: It was really hard to not.

1617
01:40:04,543 --> 01:40:05,634
TALIESIN: Anytime. You're welcome.

1618
01:40:05,634 --> 01:40:06,530
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you.

1619
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:08,333
LAURA: For a second there, Grog. For a second.
Well, a couple of seconds.

1620
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:11,297
Well, no, I did, did you not see?

1621
01:40:11,297 --> 01:40:12,545
TRAVIS: I missed it.

1622
01:40:12,545 --> 01:40:14,432
LAURA: Your back was turned for so much of the
time.

1623
01:40:14,432 --> 01:40:15,505
TALIESIN: It was amazing.

1624
01:40:15,505 --> 01:40:17,301
TRAVIS: Encore!

1625
01:40:17,301 --> 01:40:22,189
LAURA: Well, I mean, we're outside. All right.

1626
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:23,143
TRAVIS: Don't.

1627
01:40:23,143 --> 01:40:25,269
(all laugh)

1628
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:27,641
TRAVIS: I'm so sad Scanlan wasn't here for this.

1629
01:40:27,641 --> 01:40:29,207
LAURA: I know, he would've loved that.

1630
01:40:29,207 --> 01:40:31,278
TRAVIS: Yeah seriously. (sniffs)

1631
01:40:31,278 --> 01:40:34,740
LAURA: I feel like we should go celebrate and
drink, but it wouldn't feel right without him.

1632
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:42,175
TRAVIS: No, I need like a million potions,
and maybe some attractive naked women to heal me

1633
01:40:42,175 --> 01:40:44,451
back to my full health.

1634
01:40:44,451 --> 01:40:45,375
LAURA: Right.

1635
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:47,050
MARISHA: It has been a while for you, hasn't it,
Grog?

1636
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:48,158
TALIESIN: Potions or women?

1637
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:51,353
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah. I'm real cranky so I need
bandages,

1638
01:40:51,353 --> 01:40:54,892
and maybe some bondage, and just all the women.

1639
01:40:54,892 --> 01:40:55,956
LIAM: Bandages upon bondages.

1640
01:40:55,956 --> 01:40:57,306
MARISHA: Those things go together!

1641
01:40:57,306 --> 01:40:58,113
TRAVIS: Good!

1642
01:40:58,113 --> 01:40:58,986
MARISHA: That's great.

1643
01:40:58,986 --> 01:41:00,010
TRAVIS: Like a B &amp; B right?

1644
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:02,804
MARISHA: Yeah.. that's exactly what B &amp; B means.

1645
01:41:02,804 --> 01:41:05,817
TRAVIS: That's what the letters for those words
are.

1646
01:41:05,817 --> 01:41:07,188
(all laugh)

1647
01:41:07,188 --> 01:41:09,227
LIAM: How long has Scanlan been out for?

1648
01:41:09,227 --> 01:41:19,656
MATT: Uh, at this point in time Scanlan's been out
for almost a day.

1649
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:21,407
SAM: (making dying noises in the background)

1650
01:41:21,407 --> 01:41:23,378
LIAM: Gosh. I'd like to go get him, but I really
want him to wake up on his own accord.

1651
01:41:23,378 --> 01:41:25,138
MARISHA: I mean, we can try head back to
Whitestone and get Grog

1652
01:41:25,138 --> 01:41:28,771
healed up and check up on Scanlan.

1653
01:41:28,771 --> 01:41:32,410
LAURA: I think that would be good. Maybe get some
potions before we head out here, because

1654
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:36,157
everyone's low. I'll just stop by the store and
pick some health potions

1655
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:37,693
from where we got them before.

1656
01:41:37,693 --> 01:41:39,908
TRAVIS: There are nice stores here, and we haven't
even proper shopped in a while.

1657
01:41:39,908 --> 01:41:42,278
MARISHA: It's true. Vasselheim hasn't been
touched, right?

1658
01:41:42,278 --> 01:41:43,489
LIAM: Yeah. That's good thinking.

1659
01:41:43,489 --> 01:41:45,406
MATT: From what you know of the Conclave, no.

1660
01:41:45,406 --> 01:41:46,829
LAURA: I mean we've got fucking shit to sell--

1661
01:41:46,829 --> 01:41:47,624
MARISHA: (sneezes)

1662
01:41:47,624 --> 01:41:48,444
TALIESIN: Bless you.

1663
01:41:48,444 --> 01:41:48,962
MARISHA: Sorry.

1664
01:41:48,962 --> 01:41:52,252
LAURA: -- and stuff to buy, but that's kind of a
thing.

1665
01:41:52,252 --> 01:41:56,654
TRAVIS:  Or we should check out the stuff that we
got out of the den where Raishan was.

1666
01:41:56,654 --> 01:41:58,414
MARISHA: We should definitely do the research.

1667
01:41:58,414 --> 01:42:00,181
LAURA: That creepy-ass book we need to look at.

1668
01:42:00,181 --> 01:42:04,226
LIAM: Is Scanlan sleeping it off? I mean,
we're in Vasselheim, we've just bamfed across

1669
01:42:04,226 --> 01:42:06,537
miles and miles. We're here.

1670
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:07,401
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1671
01:42:07,401 --> 01:42:09,088
(all laugh)

1672
01:42:09,088 --> 01:42:10,918
MARISHA: I know!

1673
01:42:10,918 --> 01:42:13,194
SAM: Hmm, yeah, it's fine.

1674
01:42:13,194 --> 01:42:15,027
LAURA: No, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, I'm just
fucking sitting here, no big deal.

1675
01:42:15,027 --> 01:42:17,011
SAM: No, it's fine, I'm having a great dream.

1676
01:42:17,011 --> 01:42:20,729
TALIESIN: I wonder what Scanlan would say if he
were here right now?

1677
01:42:20,729 --> 01:42:22,779
SAM: Fucking come back and get me!

1678
01:42:22,779 --> 01:42:27,922
(all laugh)

1679
01:42:28,118 --> 01:42:31,258
TALIESIN: Yes, yes.

1680
01:42:31,258 --> 01:42:32,195
MARISHA: He's asleep.

1681
01:42:32,195 --> 01:42:33,108
TALIESIN: Very asleep.

1682
01:42:33,108 --> 01:42:36,140
SAM: (snores)

1683
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:37,105
MARISHA: In a coma.

1684
01:42:37,105 --> 01:42:38,579
LAURA: Shit.

1685
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:40,868
TALIESIN: Do quick shopping and then head home and
look at all the things.

1686
01:42:40,868 --> 01:42:43,878
LAURA: A quick buying of potions, I just wanna see
if I can get some stuff.

1687
01:42:43,878 --> 01:42:48,118
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1688
01:42:48,118 --> 01:42:49,663
LAURA: I should've just shaken that instead of
just--

1689
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:50,775
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1690
01:42:50,775 --> 01:42:53,075
LAURA: Yeah. 14.

1691
01:42:53,075 --> 01:43:01,899
MATT: Okay, with a cursory glance of the area of
the Quad Roads which you previously went to for

1692
01:43:01,899 --> 01:43:12,761
the acquiring of various tonics and salves and
healing liquids, you do find a new nice

1693
01:43:12,761 --> 01:43:18,508
establishment that's just recently been built.
And as you enter to check in, the gentleman at

1694
01:43:18,508 --> 01:43:20,991
the front looks up at you, and is familiar
looking, and he goes

1695
01:43:20,991 --> 01:43:25,971
"Can I help you-- No! You are not welcome. Leave.
Now. Out. Please." (snaps fingers)

1696
01:43:25,971 --> 01:43:27,282
SAM: Who's this guy?

1697
01:43:27,282 --> 01:43:28,454
MATT: And these two bouncers kind of step--

1698
01:43:28,454 --> 01:43:30,170
LAURA: Are you the cart guy? Fucking who--

1699
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:32,430
MATT: Please. No. Not her. Please!

1700
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:36,823
LAURA: I didn't abuse him. Everyone else abused
him. I was very kind to you.

1701
01:43:36,823 --> 01:43:39,543
MATT: Your business is not welcome here, goodbye.

1702
01:43:39,543 --> 01:43:47,808
TRAVIS: Excuse me, has anyone seen my friend Ve--
You.

1703
01:43:47,808 --> 01:43:49,017
MATT: You?

1704
01:43:49,017 --> 01:43:54,592
TRAVIS: -- beautiful salesman, carrier of all
delightful things.

1705
01:43:54,592 --> 01:43:56,852
LAURA: See! We're friends, we're all friends
here.

1706
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:58,912
TRAVIS: Was he uncomfortable seeing you or
something?

1707
01:43:58,912 --> 01:44:00,332
LAURA: Yeah. Said he didn't like me very much.

1708
01:44:00,332 --> 01:44:03,367
TRAVIS AND LAURA: I can't imagine why?

1709
01:44:03,367 --> 01:44:05,455
MATT: What do you want from me?

1710
01:44:05,455 --> 01:44:07,040
LAURA: Just some potions.

1711
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,038
MATT: We don't have many.

1712
01:44:09,038 --> 01:44:11,543
TRAVIS: Whatcha got?

1713
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:13,409
MATT: We can do business. We cannot.

1714
01:44:13,409 --> 01:44:16,056
LAURA: All right, I'll just stand next to him
while you do business with him.

1715
01:44:16,056 --> 01:44:17,830
MATT: You're not welcome in my establishment.

1716
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:19,990
TRAVIS: I'm really hard of hearing. Like,
I've been working--

1717
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:22,130
MATT: I can yell!

1718
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:23,663
LAURA: Could you understand that?

1719
01:44:23,663 --> 01:44:24,946
TRAVIS: It was like (mimics Matt)

1720
01:44:24,946 --> 01:44:26,012
MATT: (groans)

1721
01:44:26,012 --> 01:44:29,440
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, it's just muffled, it's just
muffled for him.

1722
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:35,270
MATT: (huffs) "Well, our stocks have been running
low since last time you came through,

1723
01:44:35,319 --> 01:44:39,535
we don't have much!" He puts up a small leather 
case and opens it.

1724
01:44:39,535 --> 01:44:43,583
TRAVIS: It is such a shame. Did you tell him
already that we have a whole kingdom's worth of

1725
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:46,196
jewelry and gold to spend, and I'm really tired
of carrying it.

1726
01:44:46,216 --> 01:44:47,153
LAURA: Stuff to sell.

1727
01:44:47,153 --> 01:44:48,454
MATT: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1728
01:44:48,454 --> 01:44:52,153
LAURA: It is so unfortunate. We are saviors of
Emon,

1729
01:44:52,153 --> 01:44:55,233
saviors of the world, really, and he doesn't
even care.

1730
01:44:55,233 --> 01:44:58,104
TRAVIS: I thought I'd lighten this backpack a
little.

1731
01:44:58,104 --> 01:45:02,669
MATT: I really don't care. I have four healing
potions and one greater. That is all I have.

1732
01:45:02,669 --> 01:45:03,848
LAURA: Oh, is it?

1733
01:45:03,848 --> 01:45:07,206
MATT: That's it. You want it? No? Then good day.

1734
01:45:07,206 --> 01:45:10,345
LAURA: You know, I don't like him, I don't even
want to buy it from him.

1735
01:45:10,345 --> 01:45:13,360
MATT: Perfect.

1736
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,136
TRAVIS: You go ahead and leave.

1737
01:45:15,136 --> 01:45:15,867
MATT: Please!

1738
01:45:15,867 --> 01:45:18,174
LAURA: No, Grog, please don't. Don't shop without
me.

1739
01:45:18,174 --> 01:45:20,861
TRAVIS: I'm just gonna yell at him really loud.

1740
01:45:21,019 --> 01:45:24,600
LAURA: No, no, I'm standing here. I can't let you
do this.

1741
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,970
MATT: Could you please just escort them out--

1742
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:30,851
TRAVIS: No, no, no, we'll take it. We'll take it.
How much?

1743
01:45:30,851 --> 01:45:35,485
For the four healing potions and the
one greater?

1744
01:45:35,485 --> 01:45:38,947
MATT: 1500 gold pieces.

1745
01:45:38,947 --> 01:45:39,781
TRAVIS: Cool!

1746
01:45:39,781 --> 01:45:45,105
LAURA: I don't know, me personally, if that is a
good amount. But Vex would know, is that a good

1747
01:45:45,105 --> 01:45:49,540
amount or is that a shit amount?

1748
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:53,173
MATT: Based on your previous dealings with this
individual,

1749
01:45:53,173 --> 01:45:55,976
the fact that you are getting a price
at all--

1750
01:45:55,976 --> 01:45:57,749
LAURA: Yeah.

1751
01:45:57,749 --> 01:45:59,248
MATT: --is good.

1752
01:45:59,248 --> 01:46:00,624
LAURA: But it's not a good price.

1753
01:46:00,624 --> 01:46:04,992
MATT: It's not a good market price, but it's also
a buyer's market right now.

1754
01:46:04,992 --> 01:46:07,524
TRAVIS: I know how to do this. I take a bag of
gold--

1755
01:46:07,524 --> 01:46:08,791
LAURA: No, Grog! Grog, Grog, Grog.

1756
01:46:08,791 --> 01:46:11,134
TRAVIS: -- pour it onto the desk. Just a pile of
gold.

1757
01:46:11,134 --> 01:46:19,941
LAURA: Grog, do not do this. Please, please,
please.

1758
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:21,394
TRAVIS: 1500 gold pieces.

1759
01:46:21,394 --> 01:46:26,539
LAURA: I just scoop it back into your little--
hold out your pouch.

1760
01:46:26,539 --> 01:46:28,882
TRAVIS: Do you not want healing potions, or what?

1761
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:29,640
LAURA: Huh?

1762
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,102
MATT: He starts putting them back into the leather
case. (huffs)

1763
01:46:31,102 --> 01:46:35,933
LAURA: I don't want his healing potions.
I think those aren't even real healing

1764
01:46:35,999 --> 01:46:37,906
potions, I think those are probably water
colored--

1765
01:46:37,906 --> 01:46:39,860
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, clearly I have to say they
have worked.

1766
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:45,533
MATT: Probably yes, you're right. They are colored
liquid of no particular worth. You're right,

1767
01:46:45,533 --> 01:46:46,549
leave. Begone.

1768
01:46:46,549 --> 01:46:47,411
LAURA: Right.

1769
01:46:47,411 --> 01:46:49,184
TRAVIS: They've worked every time.

1770
01:46:49,184 --> 01:46:51,450
LAURA: But we can-- Grog, please.

1771
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:56,840
TRAVIS: Vex. We are so rich.

1772
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:00,966
LIAM: I lean in the door and say, you've been in
there long enough to pay rent, what is going on?

1773
01:47:00,966 --> 01:47:03,209
TRAVIS: Vax, will you come in here a minute?

1774
01:47:03,209 --> 01:47:04,363
LIAM: Uh, yeah.

1775
01:47:04,363 --> 01:47:12,087
TRAVIS: Will you please tell your sister that we
have enough money to fund several townships,

1776
01:47:12,087 --> 01:47:16,631
and that this guy wants 1500 gold for four
healing potions and we have almost none.

1777
01:47:16,631 --> 01:47:18,764
LAURA: And a greater healing potion! Five healing
potions really.

1778
01:47:18,764 --> 01:47:20,217
LIAM: Is she being a pain in the arse?

1779
01:47:20,217 --> 01:47:21,580
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, c'mon, Vax.

1780
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:23,122
LIAM: We're not begging in Stillben. Will you give
the guy some fucking coin

1781
01:47:23,122 --> 01:47:24,542
so we can get the fuck out of here?

1782
01:47:24,542 --> 01:47:27,541
LAURA: Yeah, but this guy's mean!

1783
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:31,074
LIAM: My time is valuable. Will you pay him so we
can go, please?

1784
01:47:31,074 --> 01:47:34,174
TRAVIS: You're also royalty, so you should show
peasants how to act.

1785
01:47:34,174 --> 01:47:36,312
You know, stiff upper lip, pip-pip.

1786
01:47:36,312 --> 01:47:38,261
TALIESIN: So glad I'm not in this room.

1787
01:47:38,261 --> 01:47:39,463
LAURA: That's true.

1788
01:47:39,463 --> 01:47:40,964
MARISHA: My time is valuable.

1789
01:47:40,964 --> 01:47:41,867
LIAM: That was Liam.

1790
01:47:41,867 --> 01:47:42,751
MARISHA: I know, I know.

1791
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:51,620
LAURA: I am a lady, and ladies treat merchants
well, and they don't hold grudges, I hear,

1792
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:57,697
because they are ladies and they are above it.
So here. Take this 1500 gold. I'm going to count

1793
01:47:57,697 --> 01:48:03,506
it out for you, Grog. It's below him, it's beneath
him to count this gold, he's also a Lord.

1794
01:48:03,506 --> 01:48:06,093
There you are. C'mon Grand Poobah.

1795
01:48:06,093 --> 01:48:09,326
LIAM: All he hears is fart noises, and I grab her
by the mouth and I drag her out the door.

1796
01:48:09,326 --> 01:48:10,970
LAURA: Oh my god.

1797
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:16,772
MATT: He hands the potions over to Grog.
"Very well. Enjoy your day, and I'd be wary of

1798
01:48:16,772 --> 01:48:21,800
keeping her as your business contact. She's a bit
abrasive."

1799
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,486
TRAVIS: Yeah, I noticed. You've moved up in the
world, this is really nice.

1800
01:48:25,486 --> 01:48:29,886
MATT: I'm sharing it with a few folks, it's sort
of a partnership, but yes.

1801
01:48:29,886 --> 01:48:31,328
TRAVIS: Is it working out for you?

1802
01:48:31,405 --> 01:48:35,772
MATT: Well, I've had to hire bodyguards,
if that's any indication.

1803
01:48:35,772 --> 01:48:42,114
TRAVIS: If I wanted your name, like if I wanted to
call on you later, 'cause it seems like-- As far

1804
01:48:42,114 --> 01:48:44,956
back as I can remember, we've run into you quite a
bit, and I'm kind of fond of this--

1805
01:48:44,956 --> 01:48:47,067
LAURA: No, just a couple of times. Just a couple
of times.

1806
01:48:47,067 --> 01:48:48,794
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do you have a name?

1807
01:48:48,794 --> 01:48:50,711
MATT: Cidrick Gillsman.

1808
01:48:50,711 --> 01:48:52,189
TRAVIS: I will not remember that.

1809
01:48:52,189 --> 01:48:54,400
MARISHA: Oh, this guy.

1810
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,739
TRAVIS: By the way, did you have any--

1811
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,112
LAURA: It's the guy. That took advantage of Grog

1812
01:48:59,112 --> 01:49:00,270
MARISHA: That took all the money from him?

1813
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:02,250
LIAM: It's why I'm saying nothing.

1814
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:04,835
TRAVIS: --limited exclusive items and, like,
top shelf. Your most elite, (clicks tongue)

1815
01:49:04,835 --> 01:49:06,491
paying customers only?

1816
01:49:06,491 --> 01:49:09,616
MARISHA: Did you say 'a leek'?

1817
01:49:09,616 --> 01:49:13,620
MATT: I just generally run the realm of healing
balms and salves.

1818
01:49:13,684 --> 01:49:14,695
TRAVIS: Right.

1819
01:49:14,695 --> 01:49:19,122
MATT: My partner does a bit more than that,
but he is out currently picking up a shipment and

1820
01:49:19,122 --> 01:49:21,914
will be back in a few days. Try back then.

1821
01:49:21,914 --> 01:49:23,627
MARISHA: Where's his shipment from?

1822
01:49:23,627 --> 01:49:24,455
SAM: Are you there?

1823
01:49:24,455 --> 01:49:25,639
MATT: Who are you?

1824
01:49:25,639 --> 01:49:27,129
MARISHA: Did he come out? I thought he came out.

1825
01:49:27,129 --> 01:49:28,081
ALL: No.

1826
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:29,406
LIAM: No, he walked into the door with Vex.

1827
01:49:29,406 --> 01:49:30,161
MARISHA: No, sorry.

1828
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:31,899
SAM: You're at the window. When's he coming back?

1829
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:34,526
TRAVIS: Where's he getting his shipment from? Do
you trust your partner? This new guy?

1830
01:49:34,526 --> 01:49:38,911
MATT: I do, and I don't trust you enough to tell
you this information.

1831
01:49:38,911 --> 01:49:40,944
TRAVIS: I give him ten gold for the information.

1832
01:49:40,944 --> 01:49:44,440
MATT: Thank you, that is very generous. I don't
know.

1833
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,564
TRAVIS: Oh.

1834
01:49:45,564 --> 01:49:47,028
MATT: He gives the ten gold back.

1835
01:49:47,028 --> 01:49:56,516
TRAVIS: Oh! I thank you for your time, Poobah out.
And I leave.

1836
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:59,418
(all laugh)

1837
01:49:59,418 --> 01:50:02,915
MATT: All right.

1838
01:50:02,915 --> 01:50:05,554
TRAVIS: Look, I know that was hard for you.

1839
01:50:05,554 --> 01:50:06,359
LAURA: Grog.

1840
01:50:06,359 --> 01:50:07,562
TRAVIS: He was very apologetic.

1841
01:50:07,562 --> 01:50:08,411
LAURA: Was he?

1842
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:09,800
TRAVIS: Yup. He was-- yup.

1843
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,005
LAURA: Grog, he took advantage of you before--

1844
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:12,872
TRAVIS: No, he didn't.

1845
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:13,921
LAURA: -- and I didn't like that.

1846
01:50:13,921 --> 01:50:16,096
TRAVIS: No, look, his hands were on that side of
the counter the whole time.

1847
01:50:16,096 --> 01:50:16,867
LAURA: Oh?

1848
01:50:16,867 --> 01:50:17,502
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1849
01:50:17,502 --> 01:50:18,157
LAURA: Really?

1850
01:50:18,157 --> 01:50:19,069
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

1851
01:50:19,069 --> 01:50:19,955
LAURA: Well, all right then.

1852
01:50:19,955 --> 01:50:21,818
TRAVIS: Yeah, here, these are for you.

1853
01:50:21,818 --> 01:50:22,766
LAURA: Thanks, darling.

1854
01:50:22,766 --> 01:50:23,279
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1855
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:24,170
LAURA: Which one do you want?

1856
01:50:24,170 --> 01:50:28,717
TRAVIS: No, I don't want any, I need more of the
hands-on healing, you know what I'm saying?

1857
01:50:28,717 --> 01:50:33,070
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on him. Level four,
bitch!

1858
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:33,815
MATT: All right.

1859
01:50:33,815 --> 01:50:34,730
LAURA: Whoa.

1860
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:36,039
MATT: 4d8

1861
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:36,795
(all laugh)

1862
01:50:36,795 --> 01:50:37,900
TRAVIS: 4d8?

1863
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:38,897
MATT: 4d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

1864
01:50:38,897 --> 01:50:40,027
LIAM: What does that mean?

1865
01:50:40,027 --> 01:50:41,684
TALIESIN: It's like if you gave him an ice cream,
you see me running around on a sugar high for the

1866
01:50:41,684 --> 01:50:43,938
rest of the day. Never gonna burn that off.

1867
01:50:43,938 --> 01:50:44,644
LAURA: 14, 19.

1868
01:50:44,644 --> 01:50:47,035
MARISHA: Yeah, the Makey Mace-- the Mickey
Mouse-shaped one?

1869
01:50:47,035 --> 01:50:47,747
TALIESIN: Forgot the ears.

1870
01:50:47,747 --> 01:50:48,782
MARISHA: Those were great, with the ears.

1871
01:50:48,782 --> 01:50:49,542
LAURA: 22.

1872
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:50,332
TRAVIS: 22

1873
01:50:50,332 --> 01:50:52,595
TRAVIS: 31 hit points.

1874
01:50:52,668 --> 01:50:55,036
LAURA: So... who needs the greater?

1875
01:50:55,036 --> 01:50:56,428
MARISHA: I'm all right. Give it to others.

1876
01:50:56,428 --> 01:50:59,833
TRAVIS: I mean, we could take a short rest and let
me heal up for a second. Once we land somewhere.

1877
01:50:59,833 --> 01:51:01,015
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1878
01:51:01,015 --> 01:51:02,154
MARISHA: We're going home, right?

1879
01:51:02,154 --> 01:51:03,640
LIAM: You wanna rest in the tavern?

1880
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,379
TRAVIS: I mean, maybe.

1881
01:51:04,379 --> 01:51:05,375
LIAM: For an hour?

1882
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:06,845
TRAVIS: But didn't you need to go somewhere?

1883
01:51:06,845 --> 01:51:07,715
LAURA: Percy. Greater?

1884
01:51:07,715 --> 01:51:08,980
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1885
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:10,650
LAURA: Then I pass out the other healing potions
between--

1886
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:12,585
LIAM: Where I have to go is a little more
involved.

1887
01:51:12,585 --> 01:51:13,249
TRAVIS: Oh.

1888
01:51:13,249 --> 01:51:14,777
LIAM: Yeah.

1889
01:51:14,777 --> 01:51:19,495
MARISHA: Are you gonna slide by the temple?

1890
01:51:19,495 --> 01:51:24,621
LIAM: I scoop you by the arm and take you off for
a minute. You know, I want to come back here,

1891
01:51:24,621 --> 01:51:32,057
sometime. One, I would love to go to the Velvet
Cabaret again. You know, just like a date night.

1892
01:51:32,057 --> 01:51:33,470
MARISHA: Oh, that was great. Yeah, that was fu--

1893
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:35,097
LIAM: Yeah, but without somebody trying to kill
us.

1894
01:51:35,097 --> 01:51:38,530
MARISHA: -- oh my gosh, that was before we were
together. That was good times.

1895
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:40,178
(all laugh)

1896
01:51:40,178 --> 01:51:43,833
LIAM: I'd like to go back without somebody trying
to murder any of us, though.

1897
01:51:43,833 --> 01:51:45,167
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

1898
01:51:45,167 --> 01:51:49,773
LIAM: That aside, I do have to go to the temple,
but I don't want to go.

1899
01:51:49,773 --> 01:51:53,080
MARISHA: Why are you saying it like you have to go
to the toilet?

1900
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,965
LIAM: 'Cause that's kind of what it's like.

1901
01:51:54,965 --> 01:51:58,757
MARISHA: Does it feel like that? Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.

1902
01:51:58,757 --> 01:52:02,036
LIAM: Yeah, there is another shoe that's gonna
drop, probably, eventually.

1903
01:52:02,036 --> 01:52:04,432
TALIESIN: You should probably pass that, I think.

1904
01:52:04,432 --> 01:52:06,325
LIAM: I wanna get back to--

1905
01:52:06,325 --> 01:52:08,405
MARISHA: (laughs) As Percy walks by.

1906
01:52:08,405 --> 01:52:10,688
TALIESIN: No, I don't walk by. I just-- I'm amazed
that no one remembers

1907
01:52:10,688 --> 01:52:12,464
that we can hear everything
over these earpieces.

1908
01:52:12,464 --> 01:52:13,655
LAURA: No, you have to be touching your ear.

1909
01:52:13,655 --> 01:52:17,601
LIAM: No, you have to hit send, my friend.

1910
01:52:17,667 --> 01:52:20,531
MARISHA: (laughing) You have to hit send.

1911
01:52:20,531 --> 01:52:22,244
TALIESIN: Carry on, carry on.

1912
01:52:22,294 --> 01:52:24,069
(all laugh)

1913
01:52:24,069 --> 01:52:27,375
LIAM: Her other shoe is gonna drop, eventually.
And I'm not ready for that.

1914
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:32,116
MARISHA: What are you afraid of? What do you think
she's gonna ask of you?

1915
01:52:32,116 --> 01:52:34,326
LIAM: I don't know.

1916
01:52:34,326 --> 01:52:40,917
MARISHA: You think she's gonna cash in on that
bargain?

1917
01:52:40,917 --> 01:52:42,641
LIAM: Why wouldn't she?

1918
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:48,822
MARISHA: I thought you already considered paid up
in a way. I don't know.

1919
01:52:48,822 --> 01:52:51,765
LIAM: I don't know.

1920
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:53,660
MARISHA: Sure.

1921
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:58,487
LIAM: But I feel like being a little selfish and
taking a little time, and when she wants me--

1922
01:52:58,487 --> 01:53:01,873
'cause she's not talking to me at the moment--
when she wants me,

1923
01:53:01,873 --> 01:53:06,456
she'll call. So I'd like a little time.

1924
01:53:06,456 --> 01:53:09,581
MARISHA: Okay. What are you asking of me right
now?

1925
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:11,171
LIAM: Just to come back, down the road.

1926
01:53:11,171 --> 01:53:11,812
MARISHA: Later?

1927
01:53:11,812 --> 01:53:12,448
LIAM: Yeah.

1928
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,570
MARISHA: Do you wanna go now?

1929
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:14,116
LIAM: No.

1930
01:53:14,116 --> 01:53:14,877
MARISHA: While we're here?

1931
01:53:14,877 --> 01:53:15,563
LIAM: No.

1932
01:53:15,563 --> 01:53:16,536
MARISHA: You're sure?

1933
01:53:16,536 --> 01:53:18,085
LIAM: Very sure.

1934
01:53:18,085 --> 01:53:23,092
MARISHA: So, just getting this straight.
What you're proposing is a Raven

1935
01:53:23,092 --> 01:53:29,568
Queen-slash-Velvet date night visit back to
Vasselheim?

1936
01:53:29,568 --> 01:53:30,842
LIAM: Well, I don't know what's gonna happen at
the--

1937
01:53:30,842 --> 01:53:33,791
MARISHA: Like, you go to church and then we go to
the casino?

1938
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:35,489
LIAM: I'd probably do it the other way around?

1939
01:53:35,489 --> 01:53:36,365
MARISHA: Sure.

1940
01:53:36,365 --> 01:53:42,480
LIAM: Because I don't know what's gonna happen at
church. I'm talking months. Unless she rings,

1941
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:50,719
okay? I just want to spend some time with you,
before I have to do whatever the fuck she wants.

1942
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:52,518
She's going to collect.

1943
01:53:52,518 --> 01:53:53,242
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

1944
01:53:53,242 --> 01:53:57,877
LIAM: My sister is walking around and breathing.
Still.

1945
01:53:57,877 --> 01:53:58,859
MARISHA: Okay.

1946
01:53:58,859 --> 01:54:00,864
LIAM: Shocking as that is.

1947
01:54:00,864 --> 01:54:08,612
MARISHA: I mean, the fact that any of us are still
doing that is impressive at this point.

1948
01:54:08,612 --> 01:54:09,836
LIAM: Anyway.

1949
01:54:09,836 --> 01:54:14,371
MARISHA: Okay, so that will be-- that's a good
date night to look forward to.

1950
01:54:14,371 --> 01:54:16,311
Let's go home, I guess.

1951
01:54:16,311 --> 01:54:20,371
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's at least go see if little
lover boy has woken up.

1952
01:54:20,371 --> 01:54:21,571
LAURA: Yeah, we've got our potions.

1953
01:54:21,571 --> 01:54:22,951
LIAM: Way down the line.

1954
01:54:22,951 --> 01:54:23,874
MARISHA: Way down the line.

1955
01:54:23,874 --> 01:54:24,730
LIAM: Way down the line.

1956
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:31,323
MARISHA: Sure. Are you sure you don't wanna just
hop in the Raven's Spa, tonight?

1957
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:32,296
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth?

1958
01:54:32,296 --> 01:54:33,033
MARISHA: Uh-huh?

1959
01:54:33,033 --> 01:54:33,877
LIAM: Jesus.

1960
01:54:33,877 --> 01:54:34,644
LAURA: Sorry, I just--

1961
01:54:34,644 --> 01:54:35,342
LIAM: Who is that?

1962
01:54:35,342 --> 01:54:36,827
LAURA: -- finished buying those potions.

1963
01:54:36,827 --> 01:54:37,469
MARISHA: Yeah.

1964
01:54:37,469 --> 01:54:38,778
LAURA: So, do you wanna get back to Whitestone?

1965
01:54:38,778 --> 01:54:41,789
MARISHA: Are you okay? You're a little-- you look
a little sweaty.

1966
01:54:41,789 --> 01:54:44,383
LAURA: No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1967
01:54:44,383 --> 01:54:46,437
LIAM: That little vein on the side of your
forehead--

1968
01:54:46,437 --> 01:54:48,219
LAURA: You know what? We've made a lot of money,
and--

1969
01:54:48,219 --> 01:54:50,524
MARISHA: Yeah, you've got the Julia Roberts vein
going. (laughs)

1970
01:54:50,524 --> 01:54:51,337
LIAM: Who?

1971
01:54:51,337 --> 01:54:52,401
LAURA: (laughs)

1972
01:54:52,401 --> 01:54:53,391
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

1973
01:54:53,391 --> 01:54:57,061
LAURA: I really do get that thing, though,
I really do. But no, I'm okay. We're fine.

1974
01:54:57,061 --> 01:54:59,882
Everything's fine. Except Scanlan's still
unconscious,

1975
01:54:59,882 --> 01:55:02,154
so maybe we should go see if he's all right?

1976
01:55:02,154 --> 01:55:03,748
MARISHA: You're right, you're right, all right.

1977
01:55:03,748 --> 01:55:04,586
LAURA: All right.

1978
01:55:04,586 --> 01:55:06,943
MARISHA: Let's go. Let's go. Everything's fine
here too, by the way.

1979
01:55:06,943 --> 01:55:09,574
LAURA: Good, good, you guys didn't seem awkward at
all while I walked up.

1980
01:55:09,574 --> 01:55:11,056
MARISHA: No, we're never awkward.

1981
01:55:11,056 --> 01:55:11,848
TRAVIS: How do we get back?

1982
01:55:11,848 --> 01:55:12,784
LAURA: Maybe we should go.

1983
01:55:12,784 --> 01:55:13,666
MARISHA: Huh?

1984
01:55:13,666 --> 01:55:14,955
LAURA: Tree. A tree? Can you still do a Tree
Stride?

1985
01:55:14,955 --> 01:55:15,968
MARISHA: I could do a tree.

1986
01:55:15,968 --> 01:55:16,896
LAURA: Let's do a tree.

1987
01:55:16,896 --> 01:55:18,890
TRAVIS: We gotta leave the city, though,
right? Out of respect.

1988
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:20,904
LAURA: No, I don't think we have to.

1989
01:55:20,904 --> 01:55:21,487
TRAVIS: Oh.

1990
01:55:21,487 --> 01:55:23,175
LAURA: Druid magic's different.

1991
01:55:23,175 --> 01:55:23,851
MARISHA: Huh?

1992
01:55:23,851 --> 01:55:26,635
LAURA: It's not like-- It's not like showy wizard
magic.

1993
01:55:26,635 --> 01:55:30,285
TRAVIS: These rules confuse me, but okay.

1994
01:55:30,285 --> 01:55:32,346
LIAM: The wizard magic is like Broadway musicals?

1995
01:55:32,346 --> 01:55:38,606
LAURA: Yeah. It's like jazz hands. And druid magic
is like modern dance.

1996
01:55:38,606 --> 01:55:39,597
TALIESIN: Community theater.

1997
01:55:39,597 --> 01:55:40,152
MARISHA: Yes, yes.

1998
01:55:40,152 --> 01:55:42,481
LIAM: Brechtian theater. (pained groans)

1999
01:55:42,481 --> 01:55:43,592
MATT: (laughs)

2000
01:55:43,592 --> 01:55:48,331
MARISHA: If wizardry is Bob Fosse, druidism is
Twyla Tharp.

2001
01:55:48,331 --> 01:55:49,335
MATT: There you go.

2002
01:55:49,335 --> 01:55:50,562
TALIESIN: Wow. We went there.

2003
01:55:50,562 --> 01:55:51,427
TRAVIS: That was good.

2004
01:55:51,427 --> 01:55:55,526
MARISHA: I might know my modern choreographers.
Okay? Let's go back to Whitestone.

2005
01:55:55,526 --> 01:55:56,335
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2006
01:55:56,335 --> 01:56:00,003
MATT: All righty. So you find your way back to the
Abundant Terrace,

2007
01:56:00,003 --> 01:56:02,564
where you find a similar-sized tree,

2008
01:56:02,564 --> 01:56:08,132
to what you arrived in. Using Transport Via
Plants, you transport yourself back to Whitestone,

2009
01:56:08,132 --> 01:56:10,557
stepping out of the Sun Tree. Make your way--

2010
01:56:10,557 --> 01:56:11,563
LIAM: Pfft.

2011
01:56:11,563 --> 01:56:13,643
MATT: Where else, you would like to within
Whitestone?

2012
01:56:13,643 --> 01:56:17,885
MARISHA: It does not make that sound. That's what
you're trying to do. It does not sound like that.

2013
01:56:17,885 --> 01:56:18,884
LAURA: Like a little fart?

2014
01:56:18,884 --> 01:56:20,075
MARISHA: That is not canon.

2015
01:56:20,075 --> 01:56:21,129
LIAM: Trees don't fart out here?

2016
01:56:21,129 --> 01:56:24,931
MARISHA: They don't. Trees don't fart, they poot,
okay.

2017
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:25,926
LAURA: I just start heading--

2018
01:56:25,926 --> 01:56:27,390
LIAM: (loud pooting sound)

2019
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:28,224
LAURA: -- towards the castle.

2020
01:56:28,224 --> 01:56:30,979
MATT: It's the air ashari, man. So what were you
saying?

2021
01:56:30,979 --> 01:56:32,957
LAURA: I start heading towards the castle.

2022
01:56:32,957 --> 01:56:35,040
TRAVIS: On the way there, I ask Percy, Percy!
Percy.

2023
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,077
MARISHA: The Cantrip Gust.

2024
01:56:36,077 --> 01:56:38,499
TRAVIS: I know this city's, like, being rebuilt
and everything--

2025
01:56:38,499 --> 01:56:39,457
TALIESIN: Yes.

2026
01:56:39,457 --> 01:56:44,046
TRAVIS: -- but do you think there will ever be
like a pleasure hall, or a house of, you know,

2027
01:56:44,046 --> 01:56:51,391
bosoms. I mean, I just want to put out like a
couple ideas as a city, bound up.

2028
01:56:51,391 --> 01:56:55,687
TALIESIN: Of course it has one. Do I happen to
know where it is, or do I not?

2029
01:56:55,687 --> 01:56:57,476
MATT: I mean, it hasn't been--

2030
01:56:57,476 --> 01:56:59,346
TRAVIS: Nope, yeah, it's pretty empty right now,
I know this.

2031
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:00,805
MATT: -- really functional for a while.

2032
01:57:00,805 --> 01:57:01,892
TALIESIN: I feel like it would be the sort of
thing

2033
01:57:01,892 --> 01:57:03,638
that would have just existed for fuck all ever.

2034
01:57:03,638 --> 01:57:04,784
TRAVIS: No, no, no, yeah.

2035
01:57:04,784 --> 01:57:10,863
MATT: Whitestone has had-- there's generally--
There were two brothels, one was destroyed,

2036
01:57:10,863 --> 01:57:14,714
in the Briarwoods' run.

2037
01:57:14,714 --> 01:57:16,566
MARISHA: Is one called the House of Bosoms?

2038
01:57:16,566 --> 01:57:17,475
SAM: Better be.

2039
01:57:17,475 --> 01:57:18,841
MARISHA: It's like the House of Cards of porno.

2040
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:23,975
MATT: As one of the titled masters of Whitestone,
it could very well in the near future. Just tell

2041
01:57:23,975 --> 01:57:26,011
me so I can add it to the campaign guide.

2042
01:57:26,011 --> 01:57:27,495
(all laugh)

2043
01:57:27,495 --> 01:57:29,254
TRAVIS: I'll come up with something better.

2044
01:57:29,254 --> 01:57:30,593
SAM: International House of Bosoms

2045
01:57:30,593 --> 01:57:31,343
TRAVIS: Yes.

2046
01:57:31,343 --> 01:57:32,891
(all laugh)

2047
01:57:32,891 --> 01:57:34,666
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2048
01:57:34,666 --> 01:57:37,535
TRAVIS: With all the flags on it.

2049
01:57:37,535 --> 01:57:39,020
TALIESIN: Would I possibly know this?

2050
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:41,543
TRAVIS: And six different syrups to choose from in
each room.

2051
01:57:41,543 --> 01:57:43,591
SAM: Ahh, the silver dollars.

2052
01:57:43,591 --> 01:57:45,146
TALIESIN: I don't even know if I would know this.

2053
01:57:45,146 --> 01:57:46,988
MATT: You know what? Make a history check.

2054
01:57:46,988 --> 01:57:55,031
TALIESIN: A history check? That's so-- okay.
A natural twenty.

2055
01:57:55,031 --> 01:57:56,002
TRAVIS: Is it really?

2056
01:57:56,002 --> 01:57:57,042
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2057
01:57:57,042 --> 01:57:57,733
MATT: Okay.

2058
01:57:57,733 --> 01:57:59,517
TALIESIN: That's a natural twenty, with my history
is--

2059
01:57:59,517 --> 01:58:00,381
SAM: Whore check!

2060
01:58:00,381 --> 01:58:01,624
(all laugh)

2061
01:58:01,624 --> 01:58:02,989
TALIESIN: -- is a 30. That's a 30.

2062
01:58:02,989 --> 01:58:04,571
LAURA: Percy <i>knows</i> knows.

2063
01:58:04,571 --> 01:58:08,681
MATT: You've never been to it, but you recall one
of your older brothers who is of age did return

2064
01:58:08,681 --> 01:58:11,790
and tell stories of a house of--

2065
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:13,361
MARISHA: IHOB

2066
01:58:13,361 --> 01:58:15,088
MATT: -- flesh and pleasure.

2067
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:16,569
TRAVIS: Thank god.

2068
01:58:16,569 --> 01:58:21,189
MATT: You don't recall its name, but you know that
it existed somewhere on the western side of this

2069
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:25,283
city, and within a short period of time,
you could lead him to it.

2070
01:58:25,283 --> 01:58:26,513
TALIESIN: Okay.

2071
01:58:26,513 --> 01:58:28,457
SAM: And also that they serve a pancake with--

2072
01:58:28,457 --> 01:58:29,814
(all laugh)

2073
01:58:29,814 --> 01:58:31,084
TALIESIN: There's a pancake brunch.

2074
01:58:31,084 --> 01:58:32,076
TRAVIS: Smiley face?

2075
01:58:32,076 --> 01:58:34,101
SAM: -- some chocolate chips and a smiley face.

2076
01:58:34,101 --> 01:58:36,260
LIAM: The ancient Sumerians would pay for sex with
silver dollars.

2077
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:38,739
TALIESIN: I'm honestly not sure, Grog. I really
have to think about it.

2078
01:58:38,739 --> 01:58:40,596
I don't know if such a thing exists.

2079
01:58:40,596 --> 01:58:44,662
TRAVIS: But I'm just saying, you know, if you need
to lean on me to develop that sort of the economy

2080
01:58:44,662 --> 01:58:47,133
again, I'm here for you buddy.

2081
01:58:47,133 --> 01:58:48,183
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

2082
01:58:48,183 --> 01:58:48,787
TRAVIS: Okay.

2083
01:58:48,787 --> 01:58:50,534
TALIESIN: That's good to know. Excellent.

2084
01:58:50,534 --> 01:58:51,997
TRAVIS: Let's go find Scanlan.

2085
01:58:51,997 --> 01:58:53,746
(all laugh)

2086
01:58:53,746 --> 01:58:55,154
TALIESIN: I wonder if he's awake yet.

2087
01:58:55,154 --> 01:58:57,865
SAM: Search for him. Wherever he might be.

2088
01:58:57,865 --> 01:58:59,222
LAURA: Where did we leave him, again?

2089
01:58:59,222 --> 01:59:01,526
TRAVIS: I think strapped up and covered in
mayonnaise.

2090
01:59:01,526 --> 01:59:02,601
TALIESIN: Pudding. Pudding.

2091
01:59:02,601 --> 01:59:03,472
TRAVIS: Pudding.

2092
01:59:03,472 --> 01:59:04,788
LIAM: "Pudding."

2093
01:59:04,788 --> 01:59:09,298
MATT: So you guys find your way back to castle
Whitestone, upwards to Scanlan's room. The door's

2094
01:59:09,298 --> 01:59:15,480
partially ajar. On the inside you see Kaylie is
actually asleep. She's sitting on a stool next to

2095
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:23,355
the bed and her head's down, and she's very
lightly snoring. And there, in the bed, as you

2096
01:59:23,355 --> 01:59:25,282
left him, is Scanlan.

2097
01:59:25,282 --> 01:59:26,934
LAURA: His arms are still up?

2098
01:59:26,934 --> 01:59:28,537
MATT: Well, he's been turned.

2099
01:59:28,537 --> 01:59:29,500
LAURA: Okay.

2100
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:31,560
TALIESIN: We've had people taking care of that.

2101
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:32,570
LAURA: Jeez.

2102
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:34,880
TRAVIS: And Kaylie's sitting in the chair,
or is she leaning back on?

2103
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,677
MATT: No, she's leaning back in a chair and is
passed out. Scanlan is still on the bed.

2104
01:59:37,677 --> 01:59:39,732
TRAVIS: Can I please knock the legs of the chair
out?

2105
01:59:39,732 --> 01:59:43,209
TALIESIN: There's seven children in this family,
I think they're used to some tomfoolery.

2106
01:59:43,209 --> 01:59:45,406
LAURA: It's up to you, Grog.

2107
01:59:45,406 --> 01:59:49,496
TRAVIS: Yeah. I walk over and I just kick the back
leg of the chair out so she falls down.

2108
01:59:49,496 --> 01:59:52,885
MATT: (falling sound) (yelps)

2109
01:59:52,885 --> 01:59:56,919
TRAVIS: Oh my god, these chairs are so old.
Are you all right?

2110
01:59:56,919 --> 01:59:58,227
MATT: Oh, I'm gonna remember that.

2111
01:59:58,294 --> 02:00:00,045
TRAVIS: Oh right, I forgot, you'll speed bag my
nuts later, sorry.

2112
02:00:00,199 --> 02:00:04,345
LAURA: How you doing, Kaylie?

2113
02:00:04,345 --> 02:00:07,916
MATT: She looks groggy and slightly hung over and
is like,

2114
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:16,472
"All right. So, you've all come back? He hasn't
really done nothing"

2115
02:00:16,472 --> 02:00:22,242
And she kinda smacks him in the side of the face
and wipes some of the pudding off. You hear,

2116
02:00:22,242 --> 02:00:29,521
just ever so faintly, as you kinda are coming out
of your stupor, you hear what sounds like voices

2117
02:00:29,521 --> 02:00:36,287
muffled, and it comes to, you hear what sounds
like Grog, and then what sounds like Kaylie,

2118
02:00:36,287 --> 02:00:40,803
and then something hits you in the cheek and you
feel a slight tinge of pain like a flick.

2119
02:00:40,803 --> 02:00:45,451
But your eyes begin to blink, and you guys watch
as Scanlan begins to stir.

2120
02:00:45,451 --> 02:00:47,344
LAURA: How long has he been like this?

2121
02:00:47,344 --> 02:00:48,721
LIAM: Why is he covered in pudding?

2122
02:00:48,721 --> 02:00:49,846
LAURA: Who did this to him?

2123
02:00:49,846 --> 02:00:50,793
TALIESIN: I have no idea.

2124
02:00:50,793 --> 02:00:51,765
SAM: What's going on?

2125
02:00:51,765 --> 02:00:54,611
MARISHA: Keyleth takes a little bit of the gunk
off and what is it?

2126
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:55,695
LAURA: Gross.

2127
02:00:55,695 --> 02:00:57,335
MATT: It's like a vanilla custard.

2128
02:00:57,335 --> 02:00:58,191
LIAM: Thank God.

2129
02:00:58,191 --> 02:00:59,846
LAURA: That's fucking foul, Keyleth.

2130
02:00:59,846 --> 02:01:05,265
MARISHA: Look. How do you think druids discover
things, okay? Someone has to figure out what's

2131
02:01:05,265 --> 02:01:06,156
poison and what's not.

2132
02:01:06,156 --> 02:01:07,014
LIAM: Sour.

2133
02:01:07,014 --> 02:01:08,192
TALIESIN: They lick them apparently.

2134
02:01:08,192 --> 02:01:11,150
MATT: It's a little sour.

2135
02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:13,713
MARISHA: This is funny. This is funny, was this
you? This is funny!

2136
02:01:13,713 --> 02:01:15,291
SAM: Hello. Hello?

2137
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:16,629
MATT: You guys hear Scanlan talking.

2138
02:01:16,629 --> 02:01:17,688
SAM: Hello? What's going--

2139
02:01:17,688 --> 02:01:18,882
LAURA: Scanlan! (gasps)

2140
02:01:18,882 --> 02:01:19,741
SAM: Hi.

2141
02:01:19,741 --> 02:01:20,637
LIAM: Hey, buddy.

2142
02:01:20,637 --> 02:01:22,235
LAURA (sing-songy) Welcome back!

2143
02:01:22,235 --> 02:01:25,458
SAM: What-- where am I?

2144
02:01:25,458 --> 02:01:27,865
TALIESIN: You missed all the fun.

2145
02:01:27,865 --> 02:01:29,189
SAM: What's going on, where am I?

2146
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:32,239
LIAM: This is the afterlife, Scanlan, you've gone
to the good place.

2147
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:38,819
MATT: Your hands are bound up over your head
currently, and you are dressed in a nightgown and

2148
02:01:38,819 --> 02:01:45,626
your room and yourself are, there's spatters of
pudding everywhere.

2149
02:01:45,626 --> 02:01:48,090
SAM: What's going on? Why am I like this? Where am
I?

2150
02:01:48,090 --> 02:01:50,540
LAURA: You don't remember?

2151
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:52,966
SAM: No. Is the dragon alive?

2152
02:01:52,966 --> 02:01:57,674
LAURA: No, you killed it, and then we all
celebrated, and you had a big orgy.

2153
02:01:57,674 --> 02:02:01,200
TRAVIS: Yeah, you proposed to this woman
downstairs and this was your bachelor party.

2154
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:04,189
MARISHA: You clearly have some very intense
dreams, Scanlan.

2155
02:02:04,189 --> 02:02:06,244
SAM: I feel like you're fucking with me.

2156
02:02:06,244 --> 02:02:08,333
(all laugh)

2157
02:02:08,333 --> 02:02:10,294
MATT: And you hear Kaylie's voice,

2158
02:02:10,294 --> 02:02:15,024
"Oh, you think that? Probably right true."

2159
02:02:15,024 --> 02:02:17,926
SAM: What are you doing here?

2160
02:02:17,926 --> 02:02:20,728
MATT: Well, apparently your friends brought me
along to

2161
02:02:20,728 --> 02:02:24,151
make sure that you woke up nice and right.

2162
02:02:24,151 --> 02:02:26,100
SAM: They brought you here?

2163
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:27,593
MATT: Aye.

2164
02:02:27,593 --> 02:02:30,089
SAM: Where are-- are we in Whitestone?

2165
02:02:30,089 --> 02:02:30,666
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2166
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:31,826
LIAM: We're in Whitestone.

2167
02:02:31,826 --> 02:02:34,921
LAURA: Yeah.

2168
02:02:34,921 --> 02:02:37,656
TALIESIN: And the dragon is very dead. Very,
very dead.

2169
02:02:37,656 --> 02:02:43,136
LAURA: But you are not. And that's very important.

2170
02:02:43,136 --> 02:02:48,156
SAM: Kaylie, could you excuse us a moment?

2171
02:02:48,156 --> 02:02:50,153
MATT: "Aye, but at the very least--"

2172
02:02:50,153 --> 02:02:56,434
And she reaches over and undoes the bindings on
your wrists. Your fingers are a little numb.

2173
02:02:56,434 --> 02:03:00,172
You pull back and kind of rub them instinctually.
She goes,

2174
02:03:00,172 --> 02:03:03,739
"Don't take too long. I've a mind to speak to you
in a minute."

2175
02:03:03,739 --> 02:03:04,720
LAURA: Kaylie?

2176
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:05,760
MATT: Aye?

2177
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:06,900
LAURA: Thank you.

2178
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:13,466
MATT: "Sure." She just kind of storms past and
pushes, a little gnome figure pushing through the

2179
02:03:13,466 --> 02:03:18,571
crowd of Vox Machina, and out of the room.

2180
02:03:18,571 --> 02:03:29,387
SAM: I'm sorry I... fell again. Can someone answer
me one thing, though?

2181
02:03:29,387 --> 02:03:34,755
Who got Kaylie? Who brought Kaylie here?

2182
02:03:34,755 --> 02:03:35,849
TRAVIS: Vex did.

2183
02:03:35,849 --> 02:03:37,950
LAURA: I sit down on the bed with you.

2184
02:03:37,950 --> 02:03:40,045
Well, it just seemed like the logical thing
to do, dear.

2185
02:03:40,045 --> 02:03:42,526
SAM: Why the fuck would you do that?

2186
02:03:42,526 --> 02:03:46,665
LAURA: Right. Well, 'cause you said that--

2187
02:03:46,665 --> 02:03:50,484
SAM: I promised her that I wasn't going to die,
and you showed her my dead body.

2188
02:03:50,484 --> 02:03:52,433
You thought that was a good idea?

2189
02:03:52,433 --> 02:03:54,943
LAURA: What! Would you rather she just discover it
on her own? This way she--

2190
02:03:54,943 --> 02:03:57,234
SAM: No! I'd rather she never know.

2191
02:03:57,234 --> 02:04:05,248
LAURA: Scanlan. She came here. She helped bring
you back. You know what that means, right?

2192
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:08,638
SAM: Yes, I do, unfortunately.

2193
02:04:08,638 --> 02:04:11,833
LAURA: You think it's bad that she cares about
you?

2194
02:04:11,833 --> 02:04:15,039
SAM: I think it's bad that she thinks that I'm an
oathbreaker,

2195
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:20,265
that I am weak, that I failed in my
promise to her.

2196
02:04:20,265 --> 02:04:21,441
LAURA: Scanlan.

2197
02:04:21,441 --> 02:04:26,907
SAM: That everything she thought of me when she
found me is confirmed now. That I can't be

2198
02:04:26,907 --> 02:04:29,694
trusted, and I can't protect her.

2199
02:04:29,694 --> 02:04:37,580
LAURA: Scanlan. She thought nothing of you when
you met her, all right? The fact that she showed

2200
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:43,962
up here and saw that you gave your life for a
greater cause? That's so much more important than

2201
02:04:43,962 --> 02:04:50,832
any promise you made.

2202
02:04:50,832 --> 02:04:54,600
SAM: I hope that's true.

2203
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:59,538
LAURA: I think it is. She didn't run away.
And after the fact

2204
02:04:59,538 --> 02:05:03,033
she stayed here and looked after you!

2205
02:05:03,033 --> 02:05:05,020
LIAM: You should have heard her play.

2206
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:11,627
SAM: I did. I think. I heard music. I heard Pike.

2207
02:05:11,627 --> 02:05:16,172
LAURA: Wait. You heard?

2208
02:05:16,172 --> 02:05:27,329
SAM: I heard voices. I heard Pike saying a poem.
I heard someone playing music.

2209
02:05:27,329 --> 02:05:31,535
TRAVIS: Was that it?

2210
02:05:31,535 --> 02:05:33,244
SAM: Yes.

2211
02:05:33,244 --> 02:05:46,999
LIAM: All your daughter knows is that you stood
against great evil overtaking an entire continent.

2212
02:05:46,999 --> 02:05:52,589
That's nothing to sneeze at, Scanlan.

2213
02:05:52,589 --> 02:06:00,384
SAM: She also knows that I fell and that my
friends thought it would be funny to put me in a

2214
02:06:00,384 --> 02:06:03,937
fucking nightgown and spread pudding all over me.

2215
02:06:03,937 --> 02:06:05,537
TALIESIN: That was me.

2216
02:06:05,537 --> 02:06:17,511
SAM: And bring back my lifeless body and show her
how weak her father is. That's what she saw.

2217
02:06:17,511 --> 02:06:25,097
I made a promise, and I broke it, and you proved
it to her. And I wish you hadn't meddled in my

2218
02:06:25,097 --> 02:06:31,444
affairs. I don't have... I don't have many things
that I care about,

2219
02:06:31,444 --> 02:06:34,232
and I don't have anything that cares about me.

2220
02:06:34,232 --> 02:06:35,297
LAURA: That's a lie.

2221
02:06:35,297 --> 02:06:36,451
TRAVIS: That is bullshit.

2222
02:06:36,451 --> 02:06:37,425
MARISHA: Definitely not true.

2223
02:06:37,425 --> 02:06:38,686
LIAM: That's full bullshit.

2224
02:06:38,686 --> 02:06:40,810
SAM: What? You think you care about me?

2225
02:06:40,810 --> 02:06:41,330
TRAVIS: Yes.

2226
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:42,792
LIAM: Yes, asshole! Yes.

2227
02:06:42,792 --> 02:06:49,494
SAM: Yes, I'm sorry, you're right. You like me
because I make jokes, and I play songs, and I give

2228
02:06:49,494 --> 02:06:54,899
you a warm place to stay at night, and I feed you
fucking chicken, and I heal you in battle.

2229
02:06:54,899 --> 02:07:00,796
But you don't really care about me. Come on.
Let's be honest with each other. You don't really

2230
02:07:00,796 --> 02:07:01,931
give a shit about me.

2231
02:07:01,931 --> 02:07:05,953
LIAM: I've changed my outlook on life because of
you! What the fuck are you talking about? Of

2232
02:07:05,953 --> 02:07:07,061
course we all love you--

2233
02:07:07,061 --> 02:07:08,414
SAM: Prove it.

2234
02:07:08,414 --> 02:07:10,081
LIAM: -- you could crush me in a second.

2235
02:07:10,081 --> 02:07:10,723
SAM: Prove it.

2236
02:07:10,723 --> 02:07:11,414
LIAM: How?

2237
02:07:11,414 --> 02:07:13,208
LAURA: What do you want us to do?

2238
02:07:13,208 --> 02:07:19,055
SAM: We traveled into the fucking nine hells to
get Pike a set of armor. We went and battled a

2239
02:07:19,055 --> 02:07:25,732
city of vampires so Percy could feel good about
his name. We fought goliaths for Grog. We've

2240
02:07:25,732 --> 02:07:31,432
traveled across planes of existence so you could
fix your fucking daddy issues. But you've never

2241
02:07:31,432 --> 02:07:38,527
done anything for me. Ever! You've never risked
anything, you don't know me, you don't know

2242
02:07:38,527 --> 02:07:49,177
anything about me. What's my mother's name? What's
her name? Easy question. Died in front of me.

2243
02:07:49,177 --> 02:08:02,472
Killed by a goblin. Biggest part of my life.
What's her name? My father. Is he alive or dead?

2244
02:08:02,472 --> 02:08:06,541
How old am I? Where's my fucking dog?

2245
02:08:06,541 --> 02:08:07,417
LAURA: We did get the dog.

2246
02:08:07,417 --> 02:08:08,561
SAM: You don't care about me.

2247
02:08:08,561 --> 02:08:09,947
LAURA: We did get your dog.

2248
02:08:09,947 --> 02:08:10,653
SAM: Did you?

2249
02:08:10,653 --> 02:08:11,429
TRAVIS: No, we didn't.

2250
02:08:11,429 --> 02:08:12,355
LAURA: We did, I searched--

2251
02:08:12,355 --> 02:08:14,835
LIAM: I've asked your age.

2252
02:08:14,835 --> 02:08:18,371
LAURA: I thought I did the magic search.
Fucking hell.

2253
02:08:18,371 --> 02:08:25,417
SAM: It's fine. I'm just a little hungover from
being dead, and I just have been thinking for a

2254
02:08:25,417 --> 02:08:39,343
while, and, you know. Grog has Pike. Vax has
Keyleth. Percy has Vex. But Scanlan has no one,

2255
02:08:39,343 --> 02:08:48,144
and I had one chance at one real relationship
with my daughter, and I feel like you've gone and

2256
02:08:48,144 --> 02:08:54,078
fucked it up, too. Because you don't really know
me, and you don't really know what my relationship

2257
02:08:54,078 --> 02:09:03,707
is with her, and what I've promised her,
or anything, really. And it's fine. When I met

2258
02:09:03,707 --> 02:09:14,585
you all, I was just a funny little man playing
songs, and that's all I'll ever really be.

2259
02:09:14,585 --> 02:09:21,399
And that's okay, because I can take care of
myself.

2260
02:09:21,399 --> 02:09:31,756
LAURA: You don't have to, Scanlan. Nobody knew
that any of this was going on. How many times have

2261
02:09:31,756 --> 02:09:37,749
we asked you if you're all right and you just
laugh and joke? We can't help you if you don't

2262
02:09:37,749 --> 02:09:45,167
tell us what's going on.

2263
02:09:45,167 --> 02:09:47,198
SAM: I don't need your help.

2264
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:48,923
LAURA: Well, apparently you do, darling.

2265
02:09:48,923 --> 02:09:51,101
SAM: I don't like that very much at all.

2266
02:09:51,101 --> 02:09:55,967
LAURA: Get used to it. Nobody likes needing
someone.

2267
02:09:55,967 --> 02:10:01,045
MARISHA: Scanlan, do you think any of us could
have gotten here without each other? I thought you

2268
02:10:01,045 --> 02:10:05,737
knew that more than the rest of us. Maybe we just
thought

2269
02:10:05,737 --> 02:10:12,974
you didn't need us as much as you felt
like we didn't.

2270
02:10:12,974 --> 02:10:15,995
LIAM: I thought you were the only one who had
everything figured out.

2271
02:10:15,995 --> 02:10:18,558
MARISHA: I did too.

2272
02:10:18,558 --> 02:10:20,399
SAM: Well then, I must be a very good liar.

2273
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:21,969
MARISHA and LAURA: You are.

2274
02:10:21,969 --> 02:10:30,922
LIAM: I thought for months, what haven't I got
figured out that Scanlan has got figured out? I've

2275
02:10:30,922 --> 02:10:41,205
been trapped in the mud for months, wondering what
I could do to get where you are. Scanlan,

2276
02:10:41,205 --> 02:10:46,670
you fucking saved the world with us. If your
daughter can't see that,

2277
02:10:46,670 --> 02:10:51,778
then she can't see anything.

2278
02:10:51,778 --> 02:10:57,585
SAM: Yeah. If you really respected me, you
wouldn't pick me up like some sort of dwarf and

2279
02:10:57,585 --> 02:11:03,715
pick me up and put me down and take off your
fucking armor and treat me like a fucking child.

2280
02:11:03,715 --> 02:11:09,692
LIAM: You've thrown some of us like baseballs.
I don't know what that is.

2281
02:11:09,692 --> 02:11:13,761
MARISHA: Scanlan. Do you wish we wouldn't have
brought you back? Should we not have done that?

2282
02:11:13,761 --> 02:11:17,004
SAM: I just wish you wouldn't have brought her
into this.

2283
02:11:17,004 --> 02:11:17,709
MARISHA: Scanlan--

2284
02:11:17,709 --> 02:11:23,981
SAM: I had one shot with her, and now how will I
ever show her that I can be trusted? How will I

2285
02:11:23,981 --> 02:11:25,910
ever show her that I can protect her?

2286
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:27,982
LAURA: Well, maybe you should fucking talk to
her.

2287
02:11:27,982 --> 02:11:31,843
MARISHA: Yeah, you're a better father than most of
us have ever had.

2288
02:11:31,843 --> 02:11:33,665
SAM: You're right. I should talk to her.

2289
02:11:33,665 --> 02:11:34,540
LAURA: You should!

2290
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:36,188
SAM: I should! I should. And I will.

2291
02:11:36,188 --> 02:11:39,349
LAURA: Don't treat her like a fucking sacred
object, treat her like a daughter, Scanlan.

2292
02:11:39,349 --> 02:11:46,948
SAM: Fine. You're right. I will. I will.
I'll talk to her. Listen. I don't know what

2293
02:11:46,948 --> 02:11:54,488
adventure we're going on next, but I think you
should go without me.

2294
02:11:54,488 --> 02:11:58,770
TRAVIS: Really?

2295
02:11:58,770 --> 02:12:02,138
SAM: Vex is right. I should talk to her.
I should be here for her. I don't know why I

2296
02:12:02,138 --> 02:12:08,188
wasn't with her in the first place. I didn't need
to go with you to kill the dragons. I should've

2297
02:12:08,188 --> 02:12:13,339
just been with her in the first place. Probably
just scared to.

2298
02:12:13,339 --> 02:12:20,197
I should just be her father and stay.

2299
02:12:20,197 --> 02:12:23,342
TRAVIS: Can I ask you a question?

2300
02:12:23,342 --> 02:12:28,787
SAM: Yeah. No, I will not go whoring with you one
more time.

2301
02:12:28,787 --> 02:12:34,499
TRAVIS: No. I was gonna ask you what your mother's
name is.

2302
02:12:34,559 --> 02:12:36,807
SAM: It was Juniper.

2303
02:12:36,807 --> 02:12:42,251
TRAVIS: I'm sorry I didn't know that.

2304
02:12:42,251 --> 02:12:46,153
SAM: Thank you for asking.

2305
02:12:46,153 --> 02:12:49,167
LAURA: Is your father still alive?

2306
02:12:49,167 --> 02:13:07,058
SAM: I don't really know. He makes things.
Made things, I don't know. His name is Vicou.

2307
02:13:07,058 --> 02:13:20,265
TRAVIS: I'm glad you're back. Whatever you want to
do now that you are... it's up to you, mate.

2308
02:13:20,265 --> 02:13:23,158
MARISHA: I'm sorry if we had selfish intentions.

2309
02:13:23,158 --> 02:13:28,407
TRAVIS: We did have selfish in--

2310
02:13:28,407 --> 02:13:33,610
MARISHA: Yeah. Grog knows what I'm trying to say.

2311
02:13:33,610 --> 02:13:40,642
TRAVIS: We didn't think about those things.
We didn't. We thought about what you meant to us.

2312
02:13:40,642 --> 02:13:48,027
It may not feel like much, to us it feels like a
bit, but now that you're here...

2313
02:13:48,027 --> 02:13:55,726
MARISHA: Scanlan, as much as you can say that you
were just the funny guy who played music and made

2314
02:13:55,726 --> 02:14:06,174
jokes, I don't think you realize how desperately
we need that. That's nothing to scoff at,

2315
02:14:06,174 --> 02:14:13,567
that's not a talent that many of us naturally
possess. You've taught me so much about the

2316
02:14:13,567 --> 02:14:21,466
brightness of the world, and to look at the light
side of things.

2317
02:14:21,466 --> 02:14:26,124
SAM: I guess it's just easier to laugh at the
world when you don't care about it.

2318
02:14:26,124 --> 02:14:29,699
MARISHA: That's not true. You do care.

2319
02:14:29,699 --> 02:14:31,916
SAM: I know.

2320
02:14:31,916 --> 02:14:37,635
LAURA: That's why he's an asshole now.

2321
02:14:37,635 --> 02:14:43,692
LIAM: We've never had one conversation, you and I,
about my mother. Where my sister and I came from.

2322
02:14:43,692 --> 02:14:46,680
Did you know Thordak killed her?

2323
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:48,215
SAM: I think that's come up.

2324
02:14:48,215 --> 02:14:54,918
LIAM: We've never talked about it. Not once.
Because I didn't want to talk about it.

2325
02:14:54,918 --> 02:15:00,384
I didn't push into your private life. If you
wanted to talk to me, and you did, about your

2326
02:15:00,384 --> 02:15:05,059
daughter. We did. We talked in the sewers of
Westruun about your daughter because you wanted to

2327
02:15:05,059 --> 02:15:10,013
talk about her. We love you, Scanlan, and if you
want to talk about your mother or your father,

2328
02:15:10,013 --> 02:15:18,372
we will. You have not been exactly forthcoming.

2329
02:15:18,372 --> 02:15:26,291
SAM: That's fair. I haven't been. But I also
don't-- I don't have anyone.

2330
02:15:26,291 --> 02:15:39,297
I have to take care of myself. That's all.

2331
02:15:39,297 --> 02:15:42,795
LIAM: We have survived a fucking hellscape.
All of us.

2332
02:15:42,795 --> 02:15:45,203
SAM: (quietly) I didn't.

2333
02:15:45,203 --> 02:15:49,180
LIAM: You are standing before me, talking to me.
You did.

2334
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:51,485
SAM: I did not. I died. Twice.

2335
02:15:51,485 --> 02:15:53,159
LIAM: That's fucking semantics, Shorthalt.

2336
02:15:53,159 --> 02:15:55,857
SAM: In a row.

2337
02:15:55,857 --> 02:16:00,580
LIAM: You've been brought back. You're standing
here. Your daughter is there and needs you.

2338
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:10,358
SAM: I'm being kept alive by some fucked-up weird
magic. Before I met you people, I would have

2339
02:16:10,358 --> 02:16:17,322
never-- the worst I would have gotten in is a bar
fight. And I would have won. 'Cause I would have

2340
02:16:17,322 --> 02:16:29,399
been a liar and a cheater. And now, I didn't help
any of you in the last fight. I didn't do

2341
02:16:29,399 --> 02:16:34,338
anything. The fight before that, I didn't do
anything--

2342
02:16:34,338 --> 02:16:35,444
LIAM: What about the fight before that?

2343
02:16:35,444 --> 02:16:36,519
SAM: -- I'm useless!

2344
02:16:36,519 --> 02:16:37,601
LAURA: (tiredly) No, you're not.

2345
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:44,437
SAM: -- I'm out of my league. I'm out of my
league. Listen, it was fun. It's fun. It really

2346
02:16:44,437 --> 02:16:52,813
has been fun to travel with six legends. It's fun.
It's fun to say

2347
02:16:52,813 --> 02:16:56,994
that your friends are legendary fighters. 
It's fun!

2348
02:16:56,994 --> 02:17:05,440
LIAM: Excuse me! Speaking as someone who has been
fucking depressed for a long time-- Look me in the

2349
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:19,841
eye. I was shit for months. And you are one of the
main reasons I am out of that now. We would be

2350
02:17:19,841 --> 02:17:30,984
dead, all of us, if it weren't for you. The first
time we fought Raishan, we would all be dead.

2351
02:17:30,984 --> 02:17:35,352
You are in a pity party right now, and I know
you're hurting, and I'm sorry you're hurting,

2352
02:17:35,352 --> 02:17:41,112
and I love you. But you are lying to yourself,
that you have been no use to us. You are lying to

2353
02:17:41,112 --> 02:17:51,815
yourself.  If you wanna retire, if you wanna go
off with your daughter, that's fucking wonderful.

2354
02:17:51,815 --> 02:17:56,198
I encourage you to do it. But don't lie to
yourself.

2355
02:17:56,198 --> 02:18:06,061
SAM: Well, that's just it. I'm a really good
liar.

2356
02:18:06,061 --> 02:18:10,098
LIAM: (pleading) Scanlan.

2357
02:18:10,098 --> 02:18:14,828
SAM: Just give me some time.

2358
02:18:14,828 --> 02:18:23,901
MARISHA: (timidly) Hey-- hey, guys? We're friends,
right? Are we friends?

2359
02:18:23,901 --> 02:18:25,209
TALIESIN: Worse, family.

2360
02:18:25,209 --> 02:18:26,308
LIAM: Family.

2361
02:18:26,308 --> 02:18:31,917
MARISHA: That's fair.

2362
02:18:31,917 --> 02:18:35,838
TALIESIN: And for fuck's sake, sir, I will say I
died in that fight too.

2363
02:18:35,838 --> 02:18:37,086
SAM: It's not fun, is it?

2364
02:18:37,086 --> 02:18:44,162
TALIESIN: No. And let me tell you something.
Whatever lie you were trying to feed your

2365
02:18:44,162 --> 02:18:48,102
daughter out there about the man she thought you
might be, that you just thought you could tell her

2366
02:18:48,102 --> 02:18:51,664
and then she would walk away and never actually
meet you or get to know you. So that maybe she

2367
02:18:51,664 --> 02:19:03,023
would never see what a shit you can be. And you
can be a shit. That fucking girl out there is a

2368
02:19:03,023 --> 02:19:13,608
shit too. She's a miserable, lying shit.
And for fuck's sake, the thing that brought her

2369
02:19:13,608 --> 02:19:17,644
back here was the things about you that you don't
like about yourself. And don't think that they

2370
02:19:17,644 --> 02:19:28,003
don't count, either. You're a shitty person,
we know! That's not the fucking point. The point

2371
02:19:28,003 --> 02:19:44,895
is for just one moment-- one moment-- once in a
blue bloody moon... You come through in a way that

2372
02:19:44,895 --> 02:19:51,214
others can't. And you do it, and we love you for
it, and you are worthwhile, there's a reason we

2373
02:19:51,214 --> 02:20:02,168
just nearly went mad trying to bring you back.
And it was not pity. And we didn't bring her-- we

2374
02:20:02,168 --> 02:20:09,338
brought her here so that maybe she would snap you
out of wherever the fuck you were going to.

2375
02:20:09,338 --> 02:20:14,305
And I know you're not out of there yet,
I've been where you are and I know it's shit.

2376
02:20:14,305 --> 02:20:20,662
And I would really recommend, as somebody who
misses an awful lot of people, that you are honest

2377
02:20:20,662 --> 02:20:29,250
with that girl and maybe discover that she
actually likes you. As a person. Because you are

2378
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:34,983
actually likeable as a person! I know, it's coming
out of my mouth. I can feel the shit from it but

2379
02:20:34,983 --> 02:20:43,226
it's true. And for fuck's sake, get to know her
and stop making false promises that you can

2380
02:20:43,226 --> 02:20:49,338
protect her, and you'll always be there.
'Cause you can't and you won't. No one can.

2381
02:20:49,338 --> 02:20:56,195
And you're fucking lying! And it's sick.
Be a man. Be a man. I've seen you be a man,

2382
02:20:56,195 --> 02:21:02,099
I know you can fucking do it. And when you're done
with that, and we will leave you with that fucking

2383
02:21:02,318 --> 02:21:09,741
shit girl, I would like you to look up my parents'
name. You can find it on every fifth hallway in

2384
02:21:09,741 --> 02:21:15,092
this fucking city. And then I'm out.

2385
02:21:15,092 --> 02:21:16,685
MATT: (hoarsely) You leave the room?

2386
02:21:16,685 --> 02:21:17,562
TALIESIN: Mm-hm.

2387
02:21:17,562 --> 02:21:21,810
MATT: (clears throat) Okay. As you push the door
open-- it's still partially ajar-- and as you push

2388
02:21:21,810 --> 02:21:24,988
it open, leaning against the wall just by the door
is Kaylie,

2389
02:21:24,988 --> 02:21:28,501
and you can see she has tears streaming
down her face.

2390
02:21:28,501 --> 02:21:30,468
TALIESIN: I give her a big hug, a kiss on the
forehead--

2391
02:21:30,468 --> 02:21:35,278
MATT: She doesn't let you. As soon as you go for
it, she just kind of smacks it away--

2392
02:21:35,278 --> 02:21:36,158
TALIESIN: (makes an air kissing noise)

2393
02:21:36,158 --> 02:21:40,744
MAT: --turns into the room, and just kind of walks
past everyone and grabs her bag off the ground.

2394
02:21:40,744 --> 02:21:51,411
Slings it over her shoulder, grabs her violin
case. "So, you coming?"

2395
02:21:51,411 --> 02:21:55,325
SAM: ...Yeah.

2396
02:21:55,325 --> 02:22:02,229
MATT: "Grab your things. Be waiting for you
downstairs." And she walks out.

2397
02:22:02,229 --> 02:22:09,746
LAURA: Really? Just like that?

2398
02:22:09,746 --> 02:22:13,902
SAM: I have to.

2399
02:22:13,902 --> 02:22:16,459
MARISHA: Where're you going to go? What're you
going to do?

2400
02:22:16,459 --> 02:22:24,594
SAM: I'm just gonna be a Shorthalt for a while.
And I'm just gonna figure out what that means.

2401
02:22:24,594 --> 02:22:38,905
And... it's great being part of a team,
but you gotta know who you are first. So I gotta

2402
02:22:38,905 --> 02:22:51,050
go figure that out. And I gotta go figure out what
she is, too. And when I do, I'll come back and

2403
02:22:51,050 --> 02:23:02,571
find you. And if you really need a place to stay,
I'll advise you to buy some tents, 'cause you

2404
02:23:02,571 --> 02:23:14,611
won't have a mansion anymore. I know you'll be
fine 'cause you all have each other, but for now,

2405
02:23:14,611 --> 02:23:27,848
I just need to have me for a while. I love you
all. I even love Percy... and his parents,

2406
02:23:27,848 --> 02:23:36,616
Frederick and Johanna. And I'll go with Kaylie.

2407
02:23:36,616 --> 02:23:44,657
TRAVIS: Wait. I reach into the Bag of Holding and
I grab my salt-lick rock and I toss it to Scanlan.

2408
02:23:44,657 --> 02:23:46,764
SAM: What's this?

2409
02:23:46,764 --> 02:23:56,273
TRAVIS: It's yours now. When you miss us-- I know
you will-- give it a lick.

2410
02:23:56,273 --> 02:24:06,322
SAM: (choked) All right, I will.

2411
02:24:06,322 --> 02:24:09,407
LAURA: I grab the Gatestone off the end table
where

2412
02:24:09,407 --> 02:24:19,845
we left it with him and hand it over to you
as well.

2413
02:24:19,845 --> 02:24:21,789
SAM: You'll need this.

2414
02:24:21,789 --> 02:24:30,899
LAURA: I'd rather it go to you.

2415
02:24:30,899 --> 02:24:42,182
SAM: When Vex tries to give you something,
you take it. All right. Don't die.

2416
02:24:42,182 --> 02:24:56,116
LIAM: Scanlan... We'll miss you.

2417
02:24:56,116 --> 02:25:18,993
SAM: (exhales) I hope so. And... well, you said I
was right. Let's pick up that conversation later.

2418
02:25:18,993 --> 02:25:21,248
I'll go out the door.

2419
02:25:21,248 --> 02:25:31,067
MATT: Okay. As he walks down the hall, you hear
his feet across the stonework echo quieter and

2420
02:25:31,067 --> 02:25:33,916
quieter until you can't hear it anymore,
and you all

2421
02:25:33,916 --> 02:25:38,219
stand in stunned silence in the chamber.

2422
02:25:45,611 --> 02:25:47,044
LIAM: (draws in a breath) Fuck.

2423
02:25:47,044 --> 02:25:51,688
LAURA: I just pick up a pillow and throw it at the
door.

2424
02:25:51,688 --> 02:25:59,853
MATT: It opens slightly. The pillow lays on the
ground smattered with vanilla pudding.

2425
02:25:59,853 --> 02:26:03,137
TRAVIS: Did he take all his things with him?

2426
02:26:03,137 --> 02:26:13,461
MATT: I would say he would've grabbed his things
as he left, yeah.

2427
02:26:13,461 --> 02:26:16,870
LAURA: Well, that didn't go like I thought it
would.

2428
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:21,631
MARISHA: No. No it didn't.

2429
02:26:21,631 --> 02:26:25,369
LAURA: Kinda wish we would've gone drinking in
Vasselheim now.

2430
02:26:25,369 --> 02:26:28,835
TRAVIS: We might've missed him if we had.

2431
02:26:28,835 --> 02:26:37,072
LIAM: (wearily) We saved the continent, why does
everything feel like shit?

2432
02:26:37,072 --> 02:26:42,235
TRAVIS: He's alive. That's what really matters.

2433
02:26:42,235 --> 02:26:45,897
LIAM: But he's our liar, Grog.

2434
02:26:45,897 --> 02:26:48,189
LAURA: (tearily) And he hates us, now.

2435
02:26:48,189 --> 02:26:53,014
MARISHA: He doesn't hate us.

2436
02:26:53,218 --> 02:26:57,818
I just... think we've all just discovered
that maybe we have a lot more secrets about

2437
02:26:57,818 --> 02:27:10,055
ourselves than we've all ever let on.

2438
02:27:10,055 --> 02:27:19,171
TRAVIS: He needs time. We have that.

2439
02:27:19,171 --> 02:27:25,214
LAURA: (angrily) Fuck him! Fuck him for not saying
anything sooner.

2440
02:27:25,214 --> 02:27:31,825
MARISHA: I dunno.

2441
02:27:31,825 --> 02:27:37,625
LAURA: And fuck us for not asking. (sniffs)

2442
02:27:37,625 --> 02:27:50,663
MARISHA: I think Percy's right. We're worse than
friends, we're family. And family leaves.

2443
02:27:50,663 --> 02:28:00,463
LIAM: Yes. They do.

2444
02:28:00,463 --> 02:28:05,088
MARISHA: Can we not be family? Can we, like,
redact that?

2445
02:28:05,088 --> 02:28:16,222
LIAM: I don't think so. I think it's too late.

2446
02:28:17,929 --> 02:28:21,380
TRAVIS: I step out into the hallway. Do I see
Percy at all?

2447
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:24,178
TALIESIN: I'm around the corner, up on the--

2448
02:28:24,178 --> 02:28:25,331
MATT: Yeah.

2449
02:28:25,331 --> 02:28:28,394
TALIESIN: I'm outside of-- If you went far enough,
you'd see me.

2450
02:28:28,394 --> 02:28:30,034
MATT: You eventually find Percy, yeah.

2451
02:28:30,034 --> 02:28:31,286
TRAVIS: Hey.

2452
02:28:31,286 --> 02:28:33,413
TALIESIN: Hi.

2453
02:28:33,413 --> 02:28:35,626
TRAVIS: Rough one, that. Question:

2454
02:28:35,626 --> 02:28:36,573
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2455
02:28:36,573 --> 02:28:41,376
TRAVIS: Do you have any, like, sneaky people in
your employ here in the castle.

2456
02:28:41,376 --> 02:28:44,424
TALIESIN: 'Course.

2457
02:28:44,424 --> 02:28:53,138
TRAVIS: Wouldn't you feel better if we had
someone just keeping an eye on them? Bit

2458
02:28:53,301 --> 02:29:00,815
explosive, the two of them together.

2459
02:29:00,815 --> 02:29:06,285
TALIESIN: I'm torn. I don't know if he'd like
that.

2460
02:29:06,285 --> 02:29:09,633
TRAVIS: I don't know if I care. (laughs)

2461
02:29:09,633 --> 02:29:16,800
TALIESIN: I don't know if I do, either. I keep
thinking, I could just shout right now and half a

2462
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:21,602
dozen guards would stop them.

2463
02:29:21,602 --> 02:29:30,343
TRAVIS: Yeah. It'd be half a dozen dead guards,
though.

2464
02:29:30,343 --> 02:29:34,235
TALIESIN: Well, what's half a dozen dead guards
these days?

2465
02:29:34,235 --> 02:29:36,616
TRAVIS: Good point.

2466
02:29:36,616 --> 02:29:42,196
TALIESIN: There's tale of a brothel in the west
end of Whitestone. I don't know if it still exists

2467
02:29:42,196 --> 02:29:53,342
but I'm sure if you go drinking in that area,
you might find something. Sorry.

2468
02:29:53,342 --> 02:29:59,801
TRAVIS: No, yeah. Yeah. I'll go give it a look.

2469
02:29:59,801 --> 02:30:03,102
TALIESIN: When you're in the mood.

2470
02:30:03,102 --> 02:30:14,791
TRAVIS: Now's good. Yeah, I'll be back after
nightfall. Gonna go out for a bit.

2471
02:30:14,791 --> 02:30:15,679
TALIESIN: Grog.

2472
02:30:15,679 --> 02:30:22,245
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2473
02:30:22,245 --> 02:30:26,934
TALIESIN: I know we don't always agree, and I know
that I can be unkind but...

2474
02:30:26,934 --> 02:30:31,585
you know you're family, right?

2475
02:30:31,585 --> 02:30:36,442
TRAVIS: I don't know much, but I do know that.

2476
02:30:36,442 --> 02:30:43,941
TALIESIN: It's nice having an older brother again.

2477
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:49,932
TRAVIS: I leave.

2478
02:30:49,978 --> 02:30:55,128
MARISHA: So what, just-- the half-elves are left
alone in a room covered in pudding?

2479
02:30:55,128 --> 02:30:55,559
MATT: Yeah.

2480
02:30:55,559 --> 02:30:56,795
(all laugh)

2481
02:30:56,795 --> 02:30:57,948
MATT: Yeah, basically.

2482
02:30:57,948 --> 02:30:58,937
TALIESIN: Way to paint a tableau.

2483
02:30:58,937 --> 02:30:59,874
MARISHA: Crying.

2484
02:30:59,874 --> 02:31:01,307
MATT: Yeah. Crying in your pudding.

2485
02:31:01,307 --> 02:31:03,591
MARISHA: Angry.

2486
02:31:03,591 --> 02:31:05,960
TALIESIN: I think 'crying in your pudding' is
actually a British saying.

2487
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:09,442
MARISHA: Do you think that if we would've not
covered the room in pudding,

2488
02:31:09,442 --> 02:31:12,314
that he would have stayed?

2489
02:31:12,314 --> 02:31:14,166
LAURA: I start cleaning it up.

2490
02:31:14,166 --> 02:31:16,435
Well, he seemed
pretty pissed that I went and got Kaylie,

2491
02:31:16,435 --> 02:31:19,458
even though he ran away with her at the first
chance he had.

2492
02:31:19,458 --> 02:31:25,120
MARISHA: And you had to stay in a shitty BnB,
a brothel and-- (laughs)

2493
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:27,872
MATT: You see that Pike is still kinda shaking her
fist in the corner right now. She doesn't say

2494
02:31:27,872 --> 02:31:29,666
anything during this whole exchange.

2495
02:31:29,666 --> 02:31:31,832
LIAM: Pike--

2496
02:31:31,832 --> 02:31:33,259
LAURA: Pike, are you okay?

2497
02:31:33,259 --> 02:31:34,366
LIAM: How you doing, Pickle?

2498
02:31:34,366 --> 02:31:40,470
MARISHA: Oh, right, Pike. Right.

2499
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:45,863
MATT: He needs to do this... Right? He needs to do
this.

2500
02:31:45,863 --> 02:31:50,650
LAURA: He says he does.

2501
02:31:50,650 --> 02:31:53,076
MATT: What do we need to do?

2502
02:31:53,076 --> 02:31:56,904
LAURA: I have no fucking clue.

2503
02:31:56,904 --> 02:31:58,687
MATT: I need to get a drink.

2504
02:31:58,687 --> 02:32:04,779
MARISHA: Yeah. We could always go back to
Vasselheim and pick up on that little drinking.

2505
02:32:04,779 --> 02:32:06,626
LAURA: I'm not gonna go anywhere, Keyleth.

2506
02:32:06,626 --> 02:32:08,100
MARISHA: Yeah.

2507
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:11,945
LIAM: I don't wanna go back to Vasselheim.

2508
02:32:11,945 --> 02:32:16,057
MARISHA: I mean, we can drink anywhere. Vasselheim
doesn't have to be in that equation.

2509
02:32:16,057 --> 02:32:21,458
MATT: Where else do we have to go? Away from here.
I just want to be away from here.

2510
02:32:21,458 --> 02:32:22,379
LIAM: Pike--

2511
02:32:22,379 --> 02:32:27,193
MARISHA: I have to go to the water ashari.
I have to.

2512
02:32:27,193 --> 02:32:32,780
LIAM: And before too long, we have a demon who
wants you and I

2513
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:38,503
dead in the night. We have to deal with it.

2514
02:32:38,503 --> 02:32:41,591
MATT: All right. Anything else?

2515
02:32:41,591 --> 02:32:45,797
MARISHA: Pike, you know the Ozmit Sea. You've
sailed it, yeah?

2516
02:32:45,797 --> 02:32:48,013
MATT: It's been a while, but yeah.

2517
02:32:48,013 --> 02:32:51,218
MARISHA: We might need you for the water ashari.

2518
02:32:51,218 --> 02:32:53,370
MATT: I can do that.

2519
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:56,333
MARISHA: Seems like-- I guess all of us are
picking up on

2520
02:32:56,333 --> 02:33:06,867
our own individual paths from here? I guess.

2521
02:33:06,867 --> 02:33:11,756
MATT: Why can't we still help each other out?

2522
02:33:11,756 --> 02:33:15,852
LIAM: We can. Of course we can. Pike...

2523
02:33:15,852 --> 02:33:19,788
MATT: His path is his own. He has to do his thing
alone. We don't have to be alone.

2524
02:33:19,788 --> 02:33:28,768
LIAM: No. No, we don't. We just wanna slow things
down for a while.

2525
02:33:28,768 --> 02:33:32,044
It's been a long couple of months.

2526
02:33:32,044 --> 02:33:40,464
MARISHA: Is Scanlan right? Have we become too
close to each other? Do we need to all take our

2527
02:33:40,464 --> 02:33:48,157
individual time like we've done in the past?

2528
02:33:48,157 --> 02:33:59,650
LIAM: No, we just need to not have our lives on
the line every day. For a little while. Or ever.

2529
02:33:59,650 --> 02:34:14,357
Retirement's not a terrible idea. I mean,
what's the takeaway here, from Scanlan? Can't

2530
02:34:14,357 --> 02:34:26,589
hold anything in. Fuck. You know that I've always
looked up to you, for everything? That I've tried

2531
02:34:26,589 --> 02:34:32,342
to model myself after you. Do you know that? And
you.

2532
02:34:32,392 --> 02:34:37,872
You know that she's my best friend,
right? You know that.

2533
02:34:37,872 --> 02:34:39,608
MARISHA: 'Course.

2534
02:34:39,608 --> 02:34:46,130
LIAM: You know that I'm madly in love with her,
right? You know that, right? We don't need to

2535
02:34:46,130 --> 02:34:50,437
joke about it or dance around it anymore.
You know that I'm in love with her, right?

2536
02:34:50,437 --> 02:34:51,989
LAURA: Obviously.

2537
02:34:51,989 --> 02:34:56,137
LIAM: Obviously.

2538
02:34:56,137 --> 02:34:57,587
MARISHA: What are you getting at, Vax?

2539
02:34:57,587 --> 02:35:02,997
LIAM: I just don't-- He left because he felt like
we didn't know him. I'm scared to death about what

2540
02:35:02,997 --> 02:35:08,545
I have to give to a fucking god, eventually.
I'm scared of that. I don't want to do that,

2541
02:35:08,545 --> 02:35:13,141
but it's going to happen, and it's destiny.
I'm scared about that. There. That's out.

2542
02:35:13,141 --> 02:35:17,686
Do you have anything that you're holding in?
You're in love with Percival. We all know that,

2543
02:35:17,686 --> 02:35:23,525
right? It's plain as day, right?

2544
02:35:23,525 --> 02:35:37,843
LAURA: My take-away from Scanlan is that we all
talk too much. And I leave the room.

2545
02:35:37,843 --> 02:35:40,929
MARISHA: And then I look at Vax and Percy,
and say--

2546
02:35:40,929 --> 02:35:42,005
TALIESIN:  Oh, I'm not there.

2547
02:35:42,005 --> 02:35:42,854
MATT: Percy's not there

2548
02:35:42,854 --> 02:35:43,800
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. Vax and--

2549
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:44,366
MATT: Pike.

2550
02:35:44,366 --> 02:35:49,487
MARISHA: --Pike, and say: And my takeaway is that
maybe we were forgetting who we were before we all

2551
02:35:49,487 --> 02:36:03,683
banded together. And then I leave the room.

2552
02:36:03,683 --> 02:36:06,354
SAM: They're all individually going to the room
next door.

2553
02:36:06,354 --> 02:36:07,433
(all laugh)

2554
02:36:07,433 --> 02:36:08,681
MATT: Yeah, they're all just congregating in the
next chamber.

2555
02:36:08,681 --> 02:36:09,954
LAURA: And that's where Scanlan's waiting.

2556
02:36:09,954 --> 02:36:11,711
TALIESIN: It's like a Black Mirror episode

2557
02:36:11,711 --> 02:36:14,288
SAM: Everyone's reading highlights.

2558
02:36:14,288 --> 02:36:16,078
LIAM: Crack out the aerator, yo.

2559
02:36:16,078 --> 02:36:18,834
TRAVIS: Highlights.

2560
02:36:18,834 --> 02:36:20,610
LAURA: Blacklight.

2561
02:36:20,610 --> 02:36:24,015
MARISHA: It's the basement in Westworld.
We all just go catatonic.

2562
02:36:24,015 --> 02:36:27,764
MATT: Pike kinda walks up to you as they walk out
of the room and puts her gauntleted hand on your

2563
02:36:27,764 --> 02:36:39,008
shoulder and just says, "We all make mistakes,
I make 'em a lot."

2564
02:36:39,008 --> 02:36:42,394
LIAM: Yeah.

2565
02:36:42,394 --> 02:36:49,250
MATT: You have a lot of other people to look up
to, aside from just me.

2566
02:36:49,250 --> 02:36:56,418
LIAM: I've learned that.

2567
02:36:56,573 --> 02:37:03,361
MATT: His path is his own. And he'll come back.
Right?

2568
02:37:03,361 --> 02:37:15,027
LIAM: I don't know. But he's our friend.
I like having him around.

2569
02:37:15,027 --> 02:37:27,022
MATT: Me too. (sighs) Let's get a drink.

2570
02:37:27,022 --> 02:37:28,028
LIAM: What?

2571
02:37:28,028 --> 02:37:31,402
MATT Let's get a drink.

2572
02:37:31,402 --> 02:37:35,587
LIAM: Let's get a drink. You wanna go in town?

2573
02:37:35,587 --> 02:37:36,266
MATT: Yeah.

2574
02:37:36,266 --> 02:37:39,668
LIAM: All right.

2575
02:37:39,668 --> 02:37:44,951
MARISHA: I chase down Vex, and we do the same
thing.

2576
02:37:44,951 --> 02:37:51,896
MATT: You guys all individually find your way
through the rest of the afternoon to discuss,

2577
02:37:51,896 --> 02:38:06,484
cope with and ruminate on the separation of
Scanlan. Going through all the different emotions

2578
02:38:06,484 --> 02:38:10,095
you feel that are necessary, and whatever

2579
02:38:10,095 --> 02:38:15,518
activities you proceed to distract yourself with.
Grog.

2580
02:38:15,518 --> 02:38:21,671
LAURA: (laughs) Crying in a corner.

2581
02:38:21,671 --> 02:38:22,900
LIAM: (mock-crying)

2582
02:38:22,900 --> 02:38:26,991
TRAVIS: Crying on bosoms. (mock-crying)

2583
02:38:26,991 --> 02:38:32,543
(all laugh)

2584
02:38:32,543 --> 02:38:35,825
TRAVIS: I'll pay for this.

2585
02:38:35,825 --> 02:38:38,672
MATT: Yes, you will. That's extra.

2586
02:38:38,672 --> 02:38:43,371
(all laugh)

2587
02:38:43,371 --> 02:38:45,376
MATT: And strangely not uncommon.

2588
02:38:45,376 --> 02:38:48,979
LIAM: He's wrapping up the show, I can tell.
So I came to give Sam a hug.

2589
02:38:48,979 --> 02:38:49,965
LAURA: He's not! No, he's not!

2590
02:38:49,965 --> 02:38:51,522
MATT: He's not, actually. I don't know where you
got that idea.

2591
02:38:51,522 --> 02:38:52,823
LIAM: Well, I was just getting in a mid-game hug.

2592
02:38:52,823 --> 02:38:54,343
MATT: There you go! (laughs)

2593
02:38:54,343 --> 02:38:55,389
TALIESIN: This is awkward.

2594
02:38:55,389 --> 02:38:56,969
MATT: You guys still got shit to do.

2595
02:38:56,969 --> 02:38:59,343
LAURA: Guys, no. Stop it.

2596
02:38:59,343 --> 02:39:01,623
MATT: You guys made promises, you're still on a
timeline for some things.

2597
02:39:01,623 --> 02:39:03,305
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2598
02:39:03,305 --> 02:39:05,123
MATT: You still have things to do.

2599
02:39:05,123 --> 02:39:07,018
MARISHA: No, we know.

2600
02:39:07,018 --> 02:39:07,828
TALIESIN: We know.

2601
02:39:07,828 --> 02:39:10,112
LIAM: We know.

2602
02:39:10,112 --> 02:39:14,934
MATT: Don't take that as Sam closing the curtain
here. Still got shit to do.

2603
02:39:14,934 --> 02:39:19,093
LIAM: I know, but... I craved that, so I took it.

2604
02:39:19,093 --> 02:39:21,588
MATT: No, that's okay. Cross-table hugs are fine.

2605
02:39:21,588 --> 02:39:23,265
TALIESIN: That was weird.

2606
02:39:23,265 --> 02:39:27,430
MATT: The next morning comes around, you're all in
various states of hungover; should you have chosen

2607
02:39:27,430 --> 02:39:29,373
to imbibe with the rest of the party.

2608
02:39:29,373 --> 02:39:30,550
LIAM: Heavily.

2609
02:39:30,550 --> 02:39:35,402
MATT: Grog eventually wanders in, less hungover
but more meek about how his previous day was.

2610
02:39:35,402 --> 02:39:39,895
TRAVIS: Not my best night.

2611
02:39:39,895 --> 02:39:44,338
MARISHA: I see Vax the next morning and I say,
Look, your sister gave me one of her blue

2612
02:39:44,338 --> 02:39:49,468
feathers. It's because this is the darkest
timeline.

2613
02:39:49,468 --> 02:39:54,984
LAURA: I come back and I take that off. I'm like,
No, Keyleth, you took that from me when you were

2614
02:39:54,984 --> 02:39:56,669
drunk last night, actually.

2615
02:39:56,669 --> 02:40:00,794
MARISHA: It's because this is the darkest timeline
and I stole it from you.

2616
02:40:00,794 --> 02:40:10,027
LIAM: Pike and I come in wearing fun buns,
hungover. My face hurts.

2617
02:40:10,027 --> 02:40:11,247
LAURA: How is everyone?

2618
02:40:11,247 --> 02:40:13,860
MATT: She slaps you.

2619
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:15,080
TRAVIS: Amazing.

2620
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:16,848
MATT: Does it still hurt?

2621
02:40:16,848 --> 02:40:19,556
LIAM: Yeah, and also my face hurts as well.

2622
02:40:19,556 --> 02:40:21,766
MATT: Good.

2623
02:40:21,766 --> 02:40:25,239
LAURA: Percy.

2624
02:40:25,239 --> 02:40:26,795
TALIESIN: Good morning.

2625
02:40:26,795 --> 02:40:27,780
LAURA: Morning.

2626
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:29,952
MARISHA: What did you do last night?

2627
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:31,098
TALIESIN: Worked.

2628
02:40:31,098 --> 02:40:33,742
MARISHA: Worked? You were productive.

2629
02:40:33,742 --> 02:40:34,665
TALIESIN: Well...

2630
02:40:34,665 --> 02:40:36,614
MARISHA: You made the rest of us look and feel
like shit?

2631
02:40:36,614 --> 02:40:39,456
TALIESIN: I think we all have our ways of
coping.

2632
02:40:39,456 --> 02:40:42,664
MARISHA: What did you make?

2633
02:40:42,664 --> 02:40:44,101
TALIESIN: Just some sketches.

2634
02:40:44,101 --> 02:40:47,453
MARISHA: Did you bake a cake? I hope you baked a
cake.

2635
02:40:47,453 --> 02:40:48,540
TALIESIN: There's no cake.

2636
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:50,999
MARISHA: I really want coffee cake right now,
Percy.

2637
02:40:50,999 --> 02:40:53,435
TALIESIN: There are people for that.

2638
02:40:53,435 --> 02:40:54,716
LIAM: You look like me.

2639
02:40:54,716 --> 02:40:56,636
LAURA: Squish-squish. Squish-squish.

2640
02:40:56,636 --> 02:40:59,415
LIAM: You look like me. Why do you look like me?

2641
02:40:59,415 --> 02:41:04,462
LAURA: You're still drunk. Sober up. It's a new
day.

2642
02:41:04,462 --> 02:41:08,342
LIAM: That's boring.

2643
02:41:08,342 --> 02:41:15,349
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, shit! He could've broken his
nose just then, I swear. Oh my god.

2644
02:41:15,349 --> 02:41:16,657
MARISHA: Is it a new day?

2645
02:41:16,657 --> 02:41:17,452
LAURA: It is.

2646
02:41:17,452 --> 02:41:18,236
MATT: It is.

2647
02:41:18,236 --> 02:41:19,590
MARISHA: I thought it was still yesterday.

2648
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:22,740
TALIESIN: Oh hey, I've got all my hit dice back.
That's nice.

2649
02:41:22,796 --> 02:41:24,449
MATT: Yeah, spells are back, you guys are healed.

2650
02:41:24,449 --> 02:41:25,722
MARISHA: My staff is charged.

2651
02:41:25,722 --> 02:41:26,870
LAURA: You're up from nine points.

2652
02:41:26,870 --> 02:41:27,657
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2653
02:41:27,657 --> 02:41:35,089
LAURA: Hey, wake up, fuck. Wake up. It's a new
day. Open your eyes. Hey.

2654
02:41:35,089 --> 02:41:37,154
MATT: Pike casts Restoration on Vax.

2655
02:41:37,154 --> 02:41:40,273
LAURA: Hey, you're not drunk anymore, look at
that.

2656
02:41:40,273 --> 02:41:41,514
LIAM: I feel good.

2657
02:41:41,514 --> 02:41:44,838
(all laugh)

2658
02:41:45,041 --> 02:41:49,589
TRAVIS: All right. So, what? First step is the
most important one, right?

2659
02:41:49,589 --> 02:41:53,224
TALIESIN: Well, as far as I know we have three
things still on our plate.

2660
02:41:53,224 --> 02:41:55,197
MATT: Which ones?

2661
02:41:55,197 --> 02:41:56,725
TALIESIN: We've got a hand.

2662
02:41:56,725 --> 02:41:58,041
LIAM: Hotis.

2663
02:41:58,041 --> 02:42:01,951
TALIESIN: We've got the ashari, and we've got a
demon.

2664
02:42:01,951 --> 02:42:05,984
MARISHA: We also have research we have to look at
that we got from that lair of Raishan's.

2665
02:42:05,984 --> 02:42:07,603
TRAVIS: What's the hand?

2666
02:42:07,603 --> 02:42:13,381
LAURA: We have to give Ripley's hand to those guys
in Marquet. I think that's the easy one.

2667
02:42:13,381 --> 02:42:14,677
LIAM: That seems like the quickest.

2668
02:42:14,677 --> 02:42:16,057
MATT: That's definitely the quickest.

2669
02:42:16,057 --> 02:42:17,189
TRAVIS: Let's try that.

2670
02:42:17,189 --> 02:42:19,041
LIAM: My mental acuity's on point.

2671
02:42:19,041 --> 02:42:23,869
MARISHA: I feel like if I teleport I'm gonna
puke.

2672
02:42:23,869 --> 02:42:26,367
MATT: Pike grabs a bucket.

2673
02:42:26,533 --> 02:42:27,870
(all laugh)

2674
02:42:27,870 --> 02:42:32,695
TALIESIN: I run to the kitchen. I put together
something that is not quite, but probably a hot

2675
02:42:32,695 --> 02:42:37,957
sauce, with half a raw egg, and shot of something
that is quite possibly

2676
02:42:37,957 --> 02:42:41,882
but not quite some sort of
fantasy variant of tequila.

2677
02:42:41,882 --> 02:42:43,213
MARISHA: You are not--

2678
02:42:43,213 --> 02:42:44,193
TALIESIN: Swirl it all up.

2679
02:42:44,193 --> 02:42:46,236
MARISHA: -- frat-boy one-shotting me this.

2680
02:42:46,236 --> 02:42:47,759
TALIESIN: This is a thing.

2681
02:42:47,759 --> 02:42:51,969
LIAM: That's science. Listen to Percy. That's
science, you need that and you need a traditional

2682
02:42:51,969 --> 02:42:53,890
Whitestone breakfast.

2683
02:42:53,890 --> 02:42:55,652
LAURA: It's super good, Keyleth, really.

2684
02:42:55,652 --> 02:42:57,490
TALIESIN: Yeah, just get it down, just get it
down.

2685
02:42:57,490 --> 02:42:58,508
MARISHA: Why this?

2686
02:42:58,508 --> 02:42:59,646
TALIESIN: Don't look at it.

2687
02:42:59,646 --> 02:43:01,478
LIAM: Just listen to the science guy and
chug-a-lug.

2688
02:43:01,478 --> 02:43:03,917
TRAVIS: Bottoms up.

2689
02:43:03,917 --> 02:43:06,108
TALIESIN: I was kidding. You shouldn't actually
drink that.

2690
02:43:06,108 --> 02:43:11,472
MARISHA: Fuck you, motherfucker!

2691
02:43:11,472 --> 02:43:12,697
TALIESIN: Can I get a roll damage?

2692
02:43:12,697 --> 02:43:17,776
(all laugh)

2693
02:43:17,952 --> 02:43:22,760
TALIESIN: I've done something very similar to that
on many a morning.

2694
02:43:22,760 --> 02:43:27,291
MARISHA: We need to look at this research.
We need to figure out what Raishan had going on.

2695
02:43:27,291 --> 02:43:30,161
LAURA: My brain hurts from crying so much
yesterday.

2696
02:43:30,161 --> 02:43:32,158
MARISHA: I know. Are my eyes puffy?

2697
02:43:32,158 --> 02:43:32,766
TALIESIN: Yes.

2698
02:43:32,766 --> 02:43:34,377
MARISHA: Do I have bags under my-- thank you.

2699
02:43:34,377 --> 02:43:35,498
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

2700
02:43:35,498 --> 02:43:36,993
LIAM: You wear it well.

2701
02:43:36,993 --> 02:43:39,701
MATT: So what's the plan. What's up first?

2702
02:43:39,701 --> 02:43:42,811
TALIESIN: Let's take a quick look at what we got
from the cave.

2703
02:43:42,811 --> 02:43:45,158
LAURA: Maybe bring Allura and Gilmore in here,
because

2704
02:43:45,158 --> 02:43:48,517
we have that book that seemed very
nefarious.

2705
02:43:48,517 --> 02:43:50,839
MARISHA: I help Percy figure things out.

2706
02:43:50,839 --> 02:43:57,495
MATT: Okay. From the things that you gathered
off, a lot of them were candle-holders, there were

2707
02:43:57,495 --> 02:44:06,938
various reagents, some of them rotted or dried
out, a number of books and tomes, some that deal

2708
02:44:07,009 --> 02:44:11,383
with poisons, various alchemy. Actually, a similar
book to the one that you found earlier in your

2709
02:44:11,383 --> 02:44:20,934
travels, but an older version of it. And there is
the one large tome that you acquired that had the

2710
02:44:20,934 --> 02:44:25,556
more nefarious-looking leather-bound exterior,
the thicker piece.

2711
02:44:25,556 --> 02:44:26,760
TRAVIS: I'll read this.

2712
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:31,987
LAURA: No, don't touch it, Grog, I don't trust it.
I want Allura or Gilmore to look at it first.

2713
02:44:31,987 --> 02:44:38,300
MATT: The easiest person to find here would
probably be Allura, in the castle. Well, no,

2714
02:44:38,300 --> 02:44:42,812
because Allura's off in Emon helping with the
destruction. Gilmore would be the only one you

2715
02:44:42,812 --> 02:44:44,241
could really speak to currently.

2716
02:44:44,241 --> 02:44:45,435
LAURA: Or Eskil.

2717
02:44:45,435 --> 02:44:50,766
MATT: Or Eskil. But he's a little wary of you at
the moment. (laughs)

2718
02:44:50,766 --> 02:44:55,447
LAURA: I just keep making people wary of me.

2719
02:44:55,447 --> 02:44:57,974
MATT: All right, so you go ahead and you bring
Gilmore in?

2720
02:44:57,974 --> 02:44:59,951
MARISHA: Yeah.

2721
02:44:59,951 --> 02:45:04,058
MATT: Okay. And it's easy enough to bring in.
He's just waking up. (yawns)

2722
02:45:04,058 --> 02:45:07,884
"So, what can I help you with?"

2723
02:45:07,884 --> 02:45:09,040
LAURA: Hi.

2724
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:15,683
TALIESIN: We found this. Be careful, it was with
Raishan.

2725
02:45:15,683 --> 02:45:21,707
MATT: He takes it, he sits down and places it on
his lap, and tugs on his braided goatee.

2726
02:45:21,707 --> 02:45:25,598
"This smells like shit."

2727
02:45:25,598 --> 02:45:29,512
TALIESIN: Several things have died on top of it.

2728
02:45:29,512 --> 02:45:32,012
LIAM: I give my armor a sniff.

2729
02:45:32,012 --> 02:45:39,723
MATT: Smells-- different kind of shit, but shit
nonetheless. He takes a look over it.

2730
02:45:39,723 --> 02:45:50,357
"This has a very faint magical essence to it. 
Let me go ahead and--"

2731
02:45:50,406 --> 02:45:54,036
He looks over it for a second, his eyes glow with
that same

2732
02:45:54,036 --> 02:46:03,222
arcane purplish energy that flares when he does 
the Identify spell. Looks over it.

2733
02:46:03,222 --> 02:46:16,203
"This is an evil book. Reading this would be
informative, but would certainly have a cost."

2734
02:46:16,203 --> 02:46:19,561
TRAVIS: Like, money?

2735
02:46:19,561 --> 02:46:21,385
MATT: Soul-money.

2736
02:46:21,385 --> 02:46:22,567
LAURA: Soul-money.

2737
02:46:22,567 --> 02:46:24,321
TRAVIS: Do we have any of that in the bag of
holding?

2738
02:46:24,321 --> 02:46:27,474
LAURA: I don't think we do. Not anymore.

2739
02:46:27,474 --> 02:46:29,469
MATT: Wouldn't recommend it, Grog.

2740
02:46:29,469 --> 02:46:31,941
TALIESIN: What do you recommend we do with this
book?

2741
02:46:31,941 --> 02:46:37,531
MATT: Well, if you ever feel like you want some
light reading. Or find somebody who's foolish

2742
02:46:37,531 --> 02:46:42,159
enough to read it. Or at least has the willpower
to push through

2743
02:46:42,159 --> 02:46:44,408
its dark enchantments. I have no idea.

2744
02:46:44,408 --> 02:46:45,424
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2745
02:46:45,424 --> 02:46:48,878
LAURA: Let's just keep that in a--

2746
02:46:48,878 --> 02:46:50,185
TALIESIN: Going to vault that for the moment.

2747
02:46:50,185 --> 02:46:51,029
LAURA: Yeah.

2748
02:46:51,029 --> 02:46:52,929
TRAVIS: You're saying somebody could read it,
but they'd

2749
02:46:52,929 --> 02:46:56,150
have to make it all the way through the end.

2750
02:46:56,150 --> 02:47:01,636
MATT: I don't want to look into it, I'll put it
that way. But somebody with a strong enough mental

2751
02:47:01,636 --> 02:47:08,072
aptitude to be able to not be corrupted by its
dark magics.

2752
02:47:08,072 --> 02:47:10,891
It's my recommendation at the very least.

2753
02:47:10,891 --> 02:47:12,541
TALIESIN: Not anyone in this room, is what he's
saying.

2754
02:47:12,541 --> 02:47:16,777
TRAVIS: Right. What else have we got?

2755
02:47:16,777 --> 02:47:21,455
TALIESIN: I say hand. It's simple, to the point.

2756
02:47:21,455 --> 02:47:22,530
LAURA: I agree.

2757
02:47:22,530 --> 02:47:23,901
LIAM: I agree. One and done.

2758
02:47:23,901 --> 02:47:27,029
TALIESIN: And we can find the ashari on the way
back.

2759
02:47:27,029 --> 02:47:28,023
MARISHA: Yeah, we can.

2760
02:47:28,023 --> 02:47:31,965
TRAVIS: All right.

2761
02:47:31,965 --> 02:47:34,650
LAURA: This feels wrong.

2762
02:47:34,650 --> 02:47:36,843
TRAVIS: It feels different.

2763
02:47:36,843 --> 02:47:39,012
LIAM: Ah, it feels wrong.

2764
02:47:39,012 --> 02:47:41,222
MARISHA: That's not on us, though, it's on him.

2765
02:47:41,222 --> 02:47:42,983
LAURA: Can you scry?

2766
02:47:42,983 --> 02:47:43,823
MARISHA: Me?

2767
02:47:43,823 --> 02:47:46,880
LAURA: Yeah. See where he is, what he's doing.

2768
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:53,129
MARISHA: I pull out the scrying eye. Can I hold it
out in front--

2769
02:47:53,129 --> 02:47:58,167
this is kind of flavor-- and I let it
levitate in front.

2770
02:47:58,221 --> 02:48:01,524
MATT: It locks itself in place and slowly
rotates.

2771
02:48:01,524 --> 02:48:11,054
MARISHA: Can I open it like a fortune-teller's
spying sphere type of crystal--

2772
02:48:11,054 --> 02:48:14,879
LAURA: And just like project it on the wall behind
her so we can watch it like that movie.

2773
02:48:14,879 --> 02:48:17,130
MATT: The vision comes to you. It doesn't quite do
that.

2774
02:48:17,130 --> 02:48:18,629
MARISHA: That would be really awesome.

2775
02:48:18,629 --> 02:48:21,677
TRAVIS: Can I make it Imax?

2776
02:48:21,677 --> 02:48:24,371
MATT: I want that HD download, not the SD.

2777
02:48:24,371 --> 02:48:26,076
MARISHA: 5.1 Dolby digital surround.

2778
02:48:26,076 --> 02:48:29,404
LIAM: Whoa, it's all around me!

2779
02:48:29,404 --> 02:48:33,891
MARISHA: Oh my god, so many lagging issues.

2780
02:48:33,891 --> 02:48:37,366
TRAVIS: What's he rolling for?

2781
02:48:37,366 --> 02:48:38,628
LAURA: To see if he senses it, maybe.

2782
02:48:38,628 --> 02:48:39,899
LIAM: You don't know.

2783
02:48:39,899 --> 02:48:41,483
MATT: So what's your wisdom modifier?

2784
02:48:41,483 --> 02:48:42,233
SAM: Me?

2785
02:48:42,233 --> 02:48:43,885
MATT: Your wisdom saving throw.

2786
02:48:43,885 --> 02:48:46,687
SAM: Negative two.

2787
02:48:46,687 --> 02:48:49,064
LAURA: Wait, what did you roll?

2788
02:48:49,064 --> 02:48:50,694
MATT: What'd you roll?

2789
02:48:50,694 --> 02:48:55,502
SAM: I got a two total. But I get advantage
against magic.

2790
02:48:55,502 --> 02:48:58,264
MATT: You do.

2791
02:48:58,264 --> 02:48:59,609
SAM: That's a 17.

2792
02:48:59,609 --> 02:49:04,348
MATT: Plus your-- what's your wisdom saving throw
bonus?

2793
02:49:04,348 --> 02:49:07,192
SAM: I mean, that's 19, my wisdom is negative
two.

2794
02:49:07,192 --> 02:49:10,793
MATT: Oh, minus two. Got you. And your spell DC
is--

2795
02:49:10,793 --> 02:49:13,203
MARISHA: Oh, I'm spying on those bitches.

2796
02:49:13,203 --> 02:49:20,878
MATT: Okay, so. You get a brief view of what looks
to be Scanlan,

2797
02:49:20,878 --> 02:49:24,381
wearing his regular outfit and armor now.

2798
02:49:24,381 --> 02:49:25,989
MARISHA: He took his armor off? He's just regular
clothes?

2799
02:49:25,989 --> 02:49:27,622
LAURA: No, he walked out in a fucking nightgown.

2800
02:49:27,622 --> 02:49:28,665
MATT: He walked out in a nightgown.

2801
02:49:28,665 --> 02:49:29,812
MARISHA: Oh, right, yeah.

2802
02:49:29,812 --> 02:49:35,958
MATT: Through this whole emotional circumstance,
he was in a nightgown. But he is currently,

2803
02:49:35,958 --> 02:49:41,888
he's walking through the Parchwood Forest that
surrounds Whitestone. He is on the path south.

2804
02:49:41,888 --> 02:49:43,271
MARISHA: South of Whitestone?

2805
02:49:43,271 --> 02:49:48,489
MATT: Yeah. South of Whitestone. To his left is
Kaylie, and they're both with their sacks over

2806
02:49:48,489 --> 02:49:55,427
their shoulders, and they're just hiking through
the forest. They're, at the moment, not talking,

2807
02:49:55,427 --> 02:50:07,336
but they're both slightly smiling. Just kind of
enjoying the journey, and the company. And you

2808
02:50:07,336 --> 02:50:14,013
just watch them walk for a little bit through the
thick tree canopy above, the well-worn path that

2809
02:50:14,013 --> 02:50:18,902
heads south and out of the Parchwood.

2810
02:50:18,902 --> 02:50:24,797
MARISHA: He looks content. Happy, even.

2811
02:50:24,797 --> 02:50:26,147
LAURA: That's good.

2812
02:50:26,147 --> 02:50:31,037
LIAM: Yeah, good on him.

2813
02:50:31,037 --> 02:50:32,481
TRAVIS: Can you yell at him?

2814
02:50:32,481 --> 02:50:35,377
MARISHA: I feel like he's like flicking off a
bunch of trees now.

2815
02:50:35,377 --> 02:50:38,692
I don't know. He was always an odd one.

2816
02:50:38,741 --> 02:50:40,813
LIAM: To be fair, he did that about seven times a
day.

2817
02:50:40,813 --> 02:50:41,673
(all laugh)

2818
02:50:41,673 --> 02:50:42,641
MARISHA: He did, yeah.

2819
02:50:42,641 --> 02:50:43,597
LIAM: For no reason.

2820
02:50:43,597 --> 02:50:44,949
MARISHA: I never knew his animosity toward trees.

2821
02:50:44,949 --> 02:50:45,592
MATT: You never know.

2822
02:50:45,592 --> 02:50:46,301
SAM: Just in case.

2823
02:50:46,301 --> 02:50:47,742
MARISHA: I don't know.

2824
02:50:47,792 --> 02:50:49,357
(all laugh)

2825
02:50:49,357 --> 02:50:50,213
LIAM and LAURA: Just in case.

2826
02:50:50,213 --> 02:50:51,708
MARISHA: Just really hates oaks.

2827
02:50:51,708 --> 02:50:58,502
LIAM: Raven Queen, demons, you never know who's
looking over your shoulder.

2828
02:50:58,502 --> 02:51:02,128
LAURA: We should've invited Kaylie to come with
us. They could've stayed--

2829
02:51:02,175 --> 02:51:03,706
LIAM: They don't want that.

2830
02:51:03,706 --> 02:51:14,245
MARISHA: I have a feeling there's little chance we
could talk him out of it. Well! All right.

2831
02:51:14,245 --> 02:51:22,050
He's living a nice, happy, content, low-key life
now. Let's continue on.

2832
02:51:22,050 --> 02:51:23,720
LIAM: Yeah, and why shouldn't he, he earned it.

2833
02:51:23,720 --> 02:51:24,258
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2834
02:51:24,258 --> 02:51:24,987
MARISHA: Yeah, he did

2835
02:51:24,987 --> 02:51:26,825
LIAM: He earned it.

2836
02:51:26,825 --> 02:51:29,061
TRAVIS: (quietly) Dick. (louder) Sorry, what?

2837
02:51:29,061 --> 02:51:29,935
LAURA: Yeah, right.

2838
02:51:29,935 --> 02:51:32,212
MARISHA: He saved the world, what more could we
ask of anybody?

2839
02:51:32,281 --> 02:51:36,974
TRAVIS: Let's go. What clears the brain better
than travel? (sniffs) Or sex.

2840
02:51:36,974 --> 02:51:45,152
LIAM: Wait, stop, stop. I was about to say you
sounded very wise, don't fuck it up. Just, period.

2841
02:51:45,218 --> 02:51:46,269
TRAVIS: Period.

2842
02:51:46,269 --> 02:51:47,651
LIAM: Travel and sex. Done.

2843
02:51:47,651 --> 02:51:53,894
MARISHA: You know, there's merit to that.
All right, let's go.

2844
02:51:53,894 --> 02:52:02,244
LAURA: As we head to the tree, I pull Grog aside,
and I ask him: Are you all right, Grog? I mean,

2845
02:52:02,251 --> 02:52:08,181
I know, I know you got your lady favors out of
the way and all that, but... Scanlan was your

2846
02:52:08,181 --> 02:52:12,812
bestie, right? Outside of Pike.

2847
02:52:12,812 --> 02:52:18,266
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just bummed, because I'm glad
he's alive--

2848
02:52:18,266 --> 02:52:19,120
LAURA: Well, yeah.

2849
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:22,667
TRAVIS: I think that's what keeps us from being
terrible. But like-- (sniffs) I only trust like a

2850
02:52:22,667 --> 02:52:30,923
few people in the world. You, Scanlan, and Pike.
And now it's just you and Pike.

2851
02:52:30,923 --> 02:52:32,000
LAURA: Me and Pike?

2852
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:38,019
TRAVIS: No, I mean I trust the others, right,
but like... I know you on a more intimate level.

2853
02:52:38,019 --> 02:52:39,322
LAURA: Cause you saw my titties?

2854
02:52:39,322 --> 02:52:40,093
TRAVIS: Pretty much.

2855
02:52:40,093 --> 02:52:41,107
LAURA: Yeah.

2856
02:52:41,107 --> 02:52:42,521
TRAVIS: Yeah. Um.

2857
02:52:42,521 --> 02:52:46,518
MARISHA: That's literally it. I don't know if
they've ever had, like, an in depth conversation.

2858
02:52:46,518 --> 02:52:47,831
(all laugh)

2859
02:52:47,831 --> 02:52:48,647
TRAVIS: So.

2860
02:52:48,647 --> 02:52:51,155
LAURA: Right.

2861
02:52:51,155 --> 02:52:58,773
TRAVIS: That's all. I just-- I just feel a little
more sad on the inside. But I'm all right.

2862
02:52:58,930 --> 02:53:00,172
LAURA: I'm sorry, Grog.

2863
02:53:00,172 --> 02:53:01,847
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm glad he's okay.

2864
02:53:01,847 --> 02:53:02,558
LAURA: Me too.

2865
02:53:02,558 --> 02:53:04,175
MARISHA: Show him your titties again.

2866
02:53:04,175 --> 02:53:07,156
LAURA: Do you want to see them? Would that make
you feel better?

2867
02:53:07,156 --> 02:53:08,470
TRAVIS: No, it's not right, right now.

2868
02:53:08,470 --> 02:53:11,196
LAURA: Yeah, no, it didn't feel right, I just
wanted to... all right.

2869
02:53:11,196 --> 02:53:14,232
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know. It's... mmm. You know.

2870
02:53:14,232 --> 02:53:18,028
(all laugh)

2871
02:53:18,028 --> 02:53:19,241
TRAVIS: I appreciate the offer.

2872
02:53:19,288 --> 02:53:25,568
MATT: As you walk your way down to the center of
Whitestone, to the Sun Tree--

2873
02:53:25,568 --> 02:53:27,431
LIAM: It's so touching and ridiculous at the same
time.

2874
02:53:27,431 --> 02:53:37,224
MATT: I know. You recall that in the center of the
city itself, Ank'harel, as it acts as one of the

2875
02:53:37,224 --> 02:53:44,041
largest oases in the center of the central Marquet
desert, there are a number of larger trees of

2876
02:53:44,041 --> 02:53:49,276
various types, and there's one not too far from
the Suncut Bazaar, that you recall. You make that

2877
02:53:49,276 --> 02:53:54,578
your designated tree, and upon casting the spell,
you watch the Sun Tree, tear open the doorway,

2878
02:53:54,578 --> 02:53:55,829
and you step across--

2879
02:53:55,880 --> 02:54:01,101
MARISHA: As I cast the spell, I just say, Hey,
Sun Tree? Watch over Scanlan and Kaylie,

2880
02:54:01,171 --> 02:54:04,550
okay? And then go though.

2881
02:54:04,550 --> 02:54:15,872
MATT: You step through. Okay. You all emerge on
the outskirts of the Suncut Bazaar. At this point

2882
02:54:15,872 --> 02:54:25,168
in time, it would be the beginning of-- just past
dusk. The sun has gone down in Ank'harel.

2883
02:54:25,222 --> 02:54:31,330
But you can still see the oranges and reds and
purples of the recent sunset in the distance.

2884
02:54:31,330 --> 02:54:36,224
The city is bustling. Lanterns are alight all
throughout. The bazaar itself and all the various

2885
02:54:36,224 --> 02:54:41,887
multicolored towers and structures and buildings,
the beautiful city just stretch up in all

2886
02:54:41,948 --> 02:54:46,827
directions around you. You can see the bazaar
itself is lively with carts that are open,

2887
02:54:46,955 --> 02:54:54,603
shouting as various barkers are peddling their
wares. It's a very upbeat atmosphere, and one

2888
02:54:54,603 --> 02:54:58,200
that's a stark change to the Whitestone you just
stepped away from.

2889
02:54:58,357 --> 02:54:59,592
LIAM: And the sun is going down, you said?

2890
02:54:59,592 --> 02:55:00,801
MATT: The sun has already gone down.

2891
02:55:00,801 --> 02:55:01,957
LIAM: After we just woke up.

2892
02:55:01,957 --> 02:55:02,702
MATT: Yes.

2893
02:55:02,874 --> 02:55:03,592
LIAM: Jet lag.

2894
02:55:03,638 --> 02:55:04,760
LAURA: We fucked up.

2895
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:06,935
MATT: Yeah. Other part of the world.

2896
02:55:06,935 --> 02:55:07,763
TALIESIN: Jet lag.

2897
02:55:07,763 --> 02:55:08,807
LIAM: Yeah. What?

2898
02:55:08,807 --> 02:55:09,970
TALIESIN: Tree lag.

2899
02:55:09,970 --> 02:55:10,706
MARISHA: Tree lag.

2900
02:55:10,706 --> 02:55:11,415
LIAM: It's a bitch.

2901
02:55:11,415 --> 02:55:12,283
MATT: (laughs) Tree lag.

2902
02:55:12,283 --> 02:55:14,308
MARISHA: It's the worst.

2903
02:55:14,308 --> 02:55:19,869
MATT: You guys begin making your way toward 
the Debt's Respite, which is the tavern

2904
02:55:19,869 --> 02:55:23,818
that housed the Scarbearers. This is where Treev 
Bonebreaker was when

2905
02:55:23,975 --> 02:55:27,268
you last discussed the return of Ripley's
hand--

2906
02:55:27,268 --> 02:55:28,064
LAURA: Right.

2907
02:55:28,064 --> 02:55:33,351
MATT: -- as the assassin that killed one of their
own. And you're returning this hand to absolve

2908
02:55:33,351 --> 02:55:36,144
yourselves of implication in this murder.

2909
02:55:36,144 --> 02:55:36,898
MARISHA: Yes.

2910
02:55:36,898 --> 02:55:38,231
MATT: Since you discovered the body.

2911
02:55:38,231 --> 02:55:42,137
TALIESIN: I'm, for the record, not wearing the
cloak when we do this.

2912
02:55:42,137 --> 02:55:43,200
MATT: Okay.

2913
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:45,064
LAURA and MARISHA: Hey!

2914
02:55:45,064 --> 02:55:46,029
MATT: Good point!

2915
02:55:46,029 --> 02:55:49,925
TALIESIN: And just for the record, I know I'll get
yelled at for twitter on this. I have informed my

2916
02:55:49,925 --> 02:55:54,898
sister where I'm going and what's going on.
Not just going willy-nilly.

2917
02:55:54,898 --> 02:56:05,911
MATT: Right, right, Cassandra is aware. All right.
You guys walk through, you catch a few eyes as

2918
02:56:05,911 --> 02:56:09,927
you are not just outsiders walking through
Ank'harel,

2919
02:56:09,927 --> 02:56:15,750
but you're all adorned in, you know,
beautiful artifact armor--

2920
02:56:15,750 --> 02:56:16,995
LAURA: Right, we didn't put on our--

2921
02:56:16,995 --> 02:56:18,033
MATT: Magical weapons--

2922
02:56:18,033 --> 02:56:18,927
LIAM: God wear.

2923
02:56:18,927 --> 02:56:25,347
MATT: God wear, essentially. And as you walk
toward the Debt's Respite tavern, on the

2924
02:56:25,361 --> 02:56:35,784
outside you can see, there's what looks to be an
eight-and-a-half-foot tall, humanoid, golem-like

2925
02:56:35,832 --> 02:56:42,835
metallic construct. It looks similar to a golem,
but it's smaller. Like the iron golems you've

2926
02:56:42,835 --> 02:56:44,658
fought before, but it's smaller in scale.

2927
02:56:44,658 --> 02:56:47,111
LIAM: Like the one we fought in J'mon's.

2928
02:56:47,111 --> 02:56:55,356
MATT: Yeah, J'mon's, but much smaller. It's less
bulky, and more just a functional, tall,

2929
02:56:55,356 --> 02:57:00,454
metallic humanoid-type construct.

2930
02:57:00,454 --> 02:57:01,607
LIAM: Protocol droid.

2931
02:57:01,607 --> 02:57:02,698
MATT: Yeah. You see it's clutching--

2932
02:57:02,698 --> 02:57:04,904
MARISHA: (gasps) It's basically the Vision?

2933
02:57:05,064 --> 02:57:07,280
MATT: A little more ramshackle in construct.

2934
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:09,030
MARISHA: Ah, okay.

2935
02:57:09,030 --> 02:57:13,136
MATT: It's clutching a leather tome in one hand
that is open, and is holding what looks to be a

2936
02:57:13,136 --> 02:57:19,899
quill in the other, and it's just standing there
quietly. To the front of it you see, almost

2937
02:57:19,899 --> 02:57:25,754
waiting outside the tavern in the process of
thumbing through some satchels, you see a handsome

2938
02:57:25,754 --> 02:57:36,334
human male. Late 30s or so, with shoulder length,
feathered, dirty blond hair and blue-green eyes,

2939
02:57:36,334 --> 02:57:41,762
a well groomed goatee adorning his dashing smirk
as he turns and looks across you and very quickly

2940
02:57:41,762 --> 02:57:51,233
the eyes very overtly take in and categorize your
decor, your dress, your stature. And the smile

2941
02:57:51,233 --> 02:57:57,849
grows even wider. His frame is svelte, he's
adorned a set of polished, immaculate breastplate

2942
02:57:57,849 --> 02:58:03,291
armor with numerous satchels all around him,
and he carries a silver helmet under his arm that

2943
02:58:03,291 --> 02:58:09,629
shines with many, many embedded gems: diamonds,
opals. Just an opulent-looking figure who's

2944
02:58:09,629 --> 02:58:18,271
wearing what looks to be barely used, or at least
very well-kept armor and jewelry and adornments.

2945
02:58:18,271 --> 02:58:21,206
Immediately catches their attention.

2946
02:58:21,206 --> 02:58:22,204
SAM: You there!

2947
02:58:22,204 --> 02:58:23,216
LAURA: (gasps)

2948
02:58:23,216 --> 02:58:33,205
SAM: You lot! Hello! Wow! Who are you all? Look at
this, magical items from head to toe. Why,

2949
02:58:33,205 --> 02:58:35,648
I've never seen anything quite like it.

2950
02:58:35,648 --> 02:58:38,136
LIAM: Pouring it on a little thick, friend.
What's up?

2951
02:58:38,290 --> 02:58:40,320
SAM: Doty, come here, will you? Take this down.

2952
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:45,140
MATT: (stomping and creaking sounds) And you watch
as the giant construct takes a few steps forward

2953
02:58:45,140 --> 02:58:48,297
and begins writing into the book.

2954
02:58:48,297 --> 02:58:49,425
SAM: In my travels through--

2955
02:58:49,425 --> 02:58:54,993
LAURA: Fuck! It's a kleenex, it doesn't work! You
piece of shit!

2956
02:58:54,993 --> 02:58:57,345
LIAM: God dammit.

2957
02:58:57,345 --> 02:58:59,951
MARISHA: That couldn't have been more uncanny!

2958
02:58:59,951 --> 02:59:05,042
LAURA: Fuck! I didn't want to throw something hard
at him.

2959
02:59:05,042 --> 02:59:06,943
MARISHA: Hoooly shit.

2960
02:59:06,943 --> 02:59:09,841
LIAM: Fucking. Hell. (bangs table)

2961
02:59:09,841 --> 02:59:15,189
SAM: Doty. Doty, take this down: In my travels in
Anh'karel, I have never seen so many magical items

2962
02:59:15,189 --> 02:59:22,089
in one place. But then I saw them, walking up to
me, and I knew I had met some very special people.

2963
02:59:22,089 --> 02:59:28,553
That's it for now. Hello! Nice to meet
you all. The name is Taryon Darrington.

2964
02:59:28,619 --> 02:59:31,203
(all laugh)

2965
02:59:31,203 --> 02:59:35,313
MARISHA: Darrien Darriton?

2966
02:59:35,313 --> 02:59:37,404
Sam: Tary-ann-- Taryon Darrington.

2967
02:59:37,404 --> 02:59:38,569
MARISHA: Darrington.

2968
02:59:38,569 --> 02:59:45,315
SAM: My friends just call me Tary. And I'm a bit
of an adventurer. I've been traveling around this

2969
02:59:45,315 --> 02:59:52,061
continent for a while, trying to tick off things
off of my list, and I've had a few scraps and

2970
02:59:52,219 --> 02:59:58,628
scrapes. And I'm looking for more adventure.
I was travelling with a band of ne'er do wells

2971
02:59:58,628 --> 03:00:04,255
that I had hired and, well, let's just say many of
them were killed. Heh. SO. I was looking to employ

2972
03:00:04,255 --> 03:00:10,539
a ragtag group of people, elves, whatever you
are.

2973
03:00:11,018 --> 03:00:14,364
To accompany me, sort of be my side men,
if you will.

2974
03:00:14,364 --> 03:00:15,247
LAURA: (disgruntled) Oh.

2975
03:00:15,247 --> 03:00:17,721
SAM: How much would a band like you cost for a
day?

2976
03:00:17,721 --> 03:00:19,172
LAURA: 50,000 gold.

2977
03:00:19,172 --> 03:00:21,843
SAM: Oh. That's nothing. Would you--

2978
03:00:21,843 --> 03:00:23,762
TRAVIS: An hour.

2979
03:00:23,996 --> 03:00:25,594
SAM: I'm sorry?

2980
03:00:25,594 --> 03:00:26,528
LAURA: 50,000 gold an hour.

2981
03:00:26,528 --> 03:00:27,454
MARISHA: It's like our retainer fee.

2982
03:00:27,454 --> 03:00:28,552
LAURA: (quietly) Good thinking, Grog.

2983
03:00:28,552 --> 03:00:33,924
SAM: Well, I tend to employ people on a
month-by-month basis, and you get a cut of the

2984
03:00:33,924 --> 03:00:41,168
treasure as we go, of course. We can work out the
particulars, but are you in fact, guns and-- or,

2985
03:00:41,168 --> 03:00:43,019
not guns. Swords-for-hire?

2986
03:00:43,019 --> 03:00:45,285
TRAVIS: What, are you going after treasure?

2987
03:00:45,285 --> 03:00:49,751
SAM: I'm going after many things. I have a long
list of things I want to tick off.

2988
03:00:49,819 --> 03:00:51,608
TRAVIS: Are you famous?

2989
03:00:51,608 --> 03:00:57,120
SAM: Of course I am. You haven't heard of...
Well, you haven't heard of me yet because my book

2990
03:00:57,120 --> 03:01:01,669
hasn't come out yet. Doty here is recording my
legendary

2991
03:01:01,669 --> 03:01:04,610
adventures as I travel around the continents.

2992
03:01:04,610 --> 03:01:06,315
TRAVIS: How thick is the book?

2993
03:01:06,315 --> 03:01:10,412
MATT: It's pretty thick. Make a perception check.

2994
03:01:10,412 --> 03:01:11,121
TRAVIS: (surprised) Oh.

2995
03:01:11,121 --> 03:01:12,448
LAURA: Wow.

2996
03:01:12,448 --> 03:01:13,349
TRAVIS: 18!

2997
03:01:13,349 --> 03:01:22,397
MATT: Okay. It's a pretty thick book, but it looks
like Doty is maybe a third into it. A fourth.

2998
03:01:22,397 --> 03:01:25,574
TRAVIS: Lots of scribbles in that book.

2999
03:01:25,574 --> 03:01:34,654
SAM: Yes, I haven't settled on a title yet.
It will either be-- "Tary's Adventures". It's sort

3000
03:01:34,654 --> 03:01:41,404
of lame, sort of lame. Or it could be "Daring
Adventures of Darrington" or it could be "Tarry On

3001
03:01:41,404 --> 03:01:46,519
with Taryon". Or something like that, I'm working
on the title, I have a while to finish it.

3002
03:01:46,572 --> 03:01:47,835
LAURA: (sarcastic) They're all very clever.

3003
03:01:47,835 --> 03:01:50,326
TALIESIN: The Daring Trial and Tribulations of
Tary Darrington.

3004
03:01:50,326 --> 03:01:52,653
SAM: That's fantastic! Doty, please write that
down.

3005
03:01:52,653 --> 03:01:54,655
MATT: (creaks and squeaks)

3006
03:01:54,655 --> 03:01:57,875
SAM: I knew you were special when I ran into you
all, my goodness.

3007
03:01:57,875 --> 03:02:00,479
LIAM: Hey, buddy boy, we have to go to the Nine
Hells

3008
03:02:00,479 --> 03:02:03,983
in the not too distant future, are you down
for that?

3009
03:02:03,983 --> 03:02:12,016
SAM: Well.  Hold on, let me check my list....
that is on the list. It was... lower down, but,

3010
03:02:12,016 --> 03:02:17,893
it's another thing I have to tick off before I'm
a real adventurer!

3011
03:02:17,893 --> 03:02:20,682
So, I'm up for anything if you are.

3012
03:02:20,682 --> 03:02:23,427
LIAM: Hm. I do not like you.

3013
03:02:23,427 --> 03:02:26,722
MARISHA: This fucking asshole, am I right? This
fucking asshole.

3014
03:02:26,722 --> 03:02:29,062
TRAVIS: Can I insight check Asshole?

3015
03:02:29,062 --> 03:02:31,435
MATT: Yes, you may.

3016
03:02:31,435 --> 03:02:33,290
LIAM: Look at this willing accomplice
motherfucker!

3017
03:02:33,290 --> 03:02:34,375
MARISHA: I know!

3018
03:02:34,375 --> 03:02:35,607
LAURA: You piece of shit, both of you.

3019
03:02:35,607 --> 03:02:36,709
MARISHA: You're all pieces of shit.

3020
03:02:36,709 --> 03:02:38,363
LAURA: I'm so angry at everything right now.

3021
03:02:38,363 --> 03:02:39,659
TRAVIS: Is it perception or what on that?

3022
03:02:39,659 --> 03:02:40,449
MATT: Insight.

3023
03:02:40,449 --> 03:02:44,447
TALIESIN: It feels weird. New dad is wearing old
dad's skin,

3024
03:02:44,447 --> 03:02:46,583
and trying to do an impression of him and--

3025
03:02:46,583 --> 03:02:50,351
MARISHA: (yelling) I don't like change!

3026
03:02:50,404 --> 03:02:53,112
LIAM: Who cares about the whisper, what's going 
on, Sam?

3027
03:02:53,112 --> 03:02:54,069
MARISHA: Bullshit.

3028
03:02:54,069 --> 03:02:57,336
TALIESIN: Tell us about the LootCrate, Sam! Tell
us about the LootCrate.

3029
03:02:57,336 --> 03:03:03,357
LAURA: How dare you, Samuel? (gasps) He has a new
character sheet. I'm going to cry, again.

3030
03:03:03,357 --> 03:03:05,237
TALIESIN: Ah! Mother lied. Ah.

3031
03:03:05,237 --> 03:03:07,533
LAURA: I'm going to cry again. Nope. I hate Tary.
He's a dick.

3032
03:03:07,533 --> 03:03:08,721
TRAVIS: We are actually--

3033
03:03:08,721 --> 03:03:10,285
MARISHA: You're going to make Laura cry.
Look what you've done.

3034
03:03:10,285 --> 03:03:11,778
TRAVIS: We are currently under--

3035
03:03:11,778 --> 03:03:13,165
TALIESIN: Dick.

3036
03:03:13,165 --> 03:03:16,566
MARISHA: (yelling) Fuck you, Ryan Green! Fuck
you!

3037
03:03:16,566 --> 03:03:18,725
LIAM: This show is breaking apart because of you,
Sam!

3038
03:03:18,725 --> 03:03:21,409
MARISHA: You were part of this too!

3039
03:03:21,409 --> 03:03:24,773
LIAM: Show me on the character sheet where the bad
DM touched you.

3040
03:03:24,773 --> 03:03:27,983
MATT: So, bringing it back to current conversation
at hand.

3041
03:03:27,983 --> 03:03:34,280
TRAVIS: We are currently employed right now.
We're on a very, very dangerous mission.

3042
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:35,709
LAURA: A super important mission.

3043
03:03:35,709 --> 03:03:45,807
TRAVIS: However, it ends here. So, if you have the
coin, and maybe if you prove yourself not to be

3044
03:03:45,807 --> 03:03:49,732
too much of a lag-behind.

3045
03:03:49,732 --> 03:03:51,019
Percy, what do you feel like--

3046
03:03:51,019 --> 03:03:56,072
TALIESIN: I'm just saying, look, it's not like we
don't have business right now. You seem...

3047
03:03:56,072 --> 03:03:57,448
what does he seem like?

3048
03:03:57,448 --> 03:03:59,417
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you do, Tary?

3049
03:03:59,417 --> 03:04:00,837
SAM: I'm an adventurer!

3050
03:04:00,837 --> 03:04:02,602
TRAVIS: He's an adventurer.

3051
03:04:02,602 --> 03:04:03,610
(all laugh)

3052
03:04:03,610 --> 03:04:05,805
TALIESIN: You seem like a person, and that's
great.

3053
03:04:05,805 --> 03:04:07,382
TRAVIS: Like Kenneth Branagh in Harry Potter.

3054
03:04:07,382 --> 03:04:09,812
LIAM: He seems like a prat.

3055
03:04:09,812 --> 03:04:12,176
TALIESIN: I'm trying not to judge at the moment,
and--

3056
03:04:12,176 --> 03:04:13,380
LIAM: That's what you do.

3057
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:15,130
TALIESIN: I know. I've had a bad day.

3058
03:04:15,130 --> 03:04:16,099
MARISHA: We trust you to judge.

3059
03:04:16,099 --> 03:04:17,554
TRAVIS: What does he do?

3060
03:04:17,554 --> 03:04:19,617
SAM: That's my biographer, Doty.

3061
03:04:19,617 --> 03:04:22,100
TRAVIS: Does he just write stuff?

3062
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:25,474
SAM: If I tell him to. He also has other skills.

3063
03:04:25,474 --> 03:04:27,402
LAURA: What does he have?

3064
03:04:27,402 --> 03:04:31,459
SAM: Many things. I can grant powers to many
people.

3065
03:04:31,459 --> 03:04:34,819
For instance: you, Little Elf Girl, 
what's your name?

3066
03:04:34,819 --> 03:04:37,777
TRAVIS: (laughs) (quietly) I'm gonna move over
here.

3067
03:04:37,777 --> 03:04:44,308
MARISHA: Hell no. Oh-ho-ho-ho.

3068
03:04:44,308 --> 03:04:46,942
TALIESIN: I take it back, I like him.

3069
03:04:46,942 --> 03:04:48,309
LIAM: Wait, I'm stealthing.

3070
03:04:48,309 --> 03:04:53,876
MATT: Flames on the side of my face. Fire.
Heaving breaths.

3071
03:04:53,876 --> 03:04:56,836
MARISHA: Keyleth uses a fog cantrip and just fades
into the alleyway.

3072
03:04:56,836 --> 03:04:59,809
LIAM: I rolled a 33 on stealth, I'm gone!

3073
03:04:59,809 --> 03:05:03,290
TALIESIN: And I just hex into the shadows.

3074
03:05:03,290 --> 03:05:07,517
MARISHA: It's like we're in a Western when they
cut back to the tavern and everyone's gone.

3075
03:05:07,517 --> 03:05:08,771
MATT: Basically.

3076
03:05:08,771 --> 03:05:12,691
LAURA: I walk up to him. What kind of adventurer
are you

3077
03:05:12,691 --> 03:05:17,368
if you've never heard of Vox fucking
Machina?

3078
03:05:17,368 --> 03:05:25,786
SAM: Ooh! Is that a band of evildoers, is that a
roving goliath horde?

3079
03:05:25,786 --> 03:05:30,459
LAURA: Where the fuck have you been? Who are you?
No really, who the fuck are you?

3080
03:05:30,459 --> 03:05:34,249
SAM: My name is Taryon Darrington, I am an
adventurer,

3081
03:05:34,249 --> 03:05:39,458
and I have more recently set out on my
journey, that is true.

3082
03:05:39,458 --> 03:05:41,468
LAURA: This armor looks very new.

3083
03:05:41,468 --> 03:05:48,736
SAM: I have not seen so many real battles yet,
but I have fought many beasts.

3084
03:05:48,736 --> 03:05:49,915
LAURA: Mm.

3085
03:05:49,966 --> 03:05:57,677
SAM: There was one, it was a smallish beholder,
and my men took it out into a field for me and

3086
03:05:57,677 --> 03:06:01,850
sort of roughed it up for me, and then when the
time was right for the kill, they said "Come on in

3087
03:06:01,850 --> 03:06:06,943
and kill it!" And I came in and used my powers and
killed it and I checked it off the list.

3088
03:06:06,943 --> 03:06:08,729
LAURA: Oh, I see.

3089
03:06:08,729 --> 03:06:12,968
SAM: Yes. It was so thrilling.

3090
03:06:12,968 --> 03:06:15,990
TRAVIS: Your men, are you--

3091
03:06:15,990 --> 03:06:17,755
LAURA: The ones that died.

3092
03:06:17,755 --> 03:06:18,810
TRAVIS: Oh.

3093
03:06:18,810 --> 03:06:20,118
LAURA: Right?

3094
03:06:20,118 --> 03:06:23,772
SAM: They also perished, that was a different
group, yes.

3095
03:06:23,772 --> 03:06:24,656
LAURA: Wonderful.

3096
03:06:24,656 --> 03:06:30,011
SAM: But they were well-paid before they went,
and I'm sure they sent some of the money home.

3097
03:06:30,011 --> 03:06:32,882
Some of them, I think they do that, typically.

3098
03:06:32,882 --> 03:06:35,557
TRAVIS: What else is on your list, what're you
looking for?

3099
03:06:35,557 --> 03:06:39,776
SAM: I've got a long list of beasts and animals
I'd like to slay--

3100
03:06:39,776 --> 03:06:40,936
TRAVIS: Just give me one.

3101
03:06:40,936 --> 03:06:44,207
SAM: Uh, naga, I think that's how you say it.

3102
03:06:44,207 --> 03:06:45,303
LAURA: That is how you say it.

3103
03:06:45,303 --> 03:06:46,390
TRAVIS. It's actually nah-jah.

3104
03:06:46,390 --> 03:06:47,260
SAM: Okay.

3105
03:06:47,260 --> 03:06:49,370
MARISHA: (laughs) Nah-jah!

3106
03:06:49,370 --> 03:06:54,209
SAM: I've already gotten a smaller beholder.
Someday I'd like to see a dragon, maybe have a

3107
03:06:54,209 --> 03:06:55,819
crack at it or two.

3108
03:06:55,819 --> 03:06:58,803
LAURA: Oh, I'm sure you'd take it out in no time,
dear.

3109
03:06:58,803 --> 03:06:59,514
TALIESIN: Right.

3110
03:06:59,514 --> 03:07:00,853
MARISHA: Man, I fucking hate this guy.

3111
03:07:00,853 --> 03:07:06,214
SAM: I feel like you're condescending to me! I'm
not, I'm not a dullard, here. I can do a lot of

3112
03:07:06,214 --> 03:07:12,990
things! My wealth has bought me many different
artifacts from my travels,

3113
03:07:12,990 --> 03:07:17,182
and they all do majorly magical things.

3114
03:07:17,182 --> 03:07:18,907
TRAVIS: What kind of weapons does he have on him?

3115
03:07:18,907 --> 03:07:21,409
SAM: I have a rod.

3116
03:07:21,409 --> 03:07:22,341
LAURA: An Immovable Rod?

3117
03:07:22,341 --> 03:07:23,384
TRAVIS: Is it movable?

3118
03:07:23,384 --> 03:07:26,556
SAM: No, it's whatever I want it to be. Sword!

3119
03:07:26,556 --> 03:07:30,870
MATT: You watch as the rod all of a sudden
transforms into this sudden liquid, metal-like

3120
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:34,413
visage, and then solidifies into a longsword.

3121
03:07:34,413 --> 03:07:35,459
SAM: Fire!

3122
03:07:35,459 --> 03:07:37,232
MATT: It bursts into flames.

3123
03:07:37,232 --> 03:07:38,281
TRAVIS: Now that is fucking great.

3124
03:07:38,281 --> 03:07:42,764
SAM: It's fucking cool, isn't it?!

3125
03:07:42,764 --> 03:07:44,094
LAURA: How much money did that cost?

3126
03:07:44,094 --> 03:07:51,375
SAM: Oh, like, 400,000 gold or something? It was a
lot of money. I don't quite... Doty keeps the

3127
03:07:51,375 --> 03:07:54,456
facts and figures. Doty, can you show me that
piece of the book?

3128
03:07:54,456 --> 03:07:57,879
MATT: (mechanical squeaks, pages turning,
squeaks). Turns it around.

3129
03:07:57,879 --> 03:08:00,094
SAM: That's embarrassing.

3130
03:08:00,094 --> 03:08:03,752
MATT: Shows the page to you and you glance through
it, and the actual construction of the item cost

3131
03:08:03,752 --> 03:08:07,302
you upwards around 65 to 70,000 gold.

3132
03:08:07,302 --> 03:08:09,394
LAURA: That's it?!

3133
03:08:09,394 --> 03:08:10,453
MATT: It's a lot of money.

3134
03:08:10,453 --> 03:08:12,367
LAURA: Well I know, but--

3135
03:08:12,367 --> 03:08:17,345
TRAVIS: So wait, you want to come with us,
or you want us to come with you?

3136
03:08:17,345 --> 03:08:22,606
SAM: I don't have a current adventure right now.
Fire off.

3137
03:08:22,837 --> 03:08:29,953
Still getting used to some of the
contraptions.

3138
03:08:29,953 --> 03:08:35,626
LAURA: Tell you what, Tary? 50,000 gold and you
can follow us right now as we finish this very

3139
03:08:35,626 --> 03:08:37,386
adventurous errand we're running.

3140
03:08:37,386 --> 03:08:38,617
MARISHA: What! Vex!

3141
03:08:38,617 --> 03:08:39,292
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3142
03:08:39,292 --> 03:08:40,062
MARISHA: What?!

3143
03:08:40,062 --> 03:08:42,121
LAURA: 50,000 gold. Small fee.

3144
03:08:42,121 --> 03:08:43,980
SAM: What kind of adventure is this, again? You
mentioned

3145
03:08:43,980 --> 03:08:46,473
you're going to do something very dangerous.

3146
03:08:46,473 --> 03:08:47,425
LAURA: It's so dangerous.

3147
03:08:47,425 --> 03:08:48,495
TRAVIS: So dangerous.

3148
03:08:48,495 --> 03:08:50,057
LAURA: We're going into this dangerous--

3149
03:08:50,057 --> 03:08:51,044
SAM: Can you tell me what it is?

3150
03:08:51,044 --> 03:08:52,018
LAURA: I'm afraid I can't, it's very--

3151
03:08:52,018 --> 03:08:57,283
TRAVIS: It's a test of your reflexes, on point,
how you handle things you're not quite ready for.

3152
03:08:57,349 --> 03:08:59,600
SAM: I could limber up, sure.

3153
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:02,362
LIAM: I stealth up behind Keyleth and rest my chin
on her shoulder and just say

3154
03:09:02,362 --> 03:09:04,869
Whaaat the fuuuuck.

3155
03:09:04,869 --> 03:09:07,757
(all laugh)

3156
03:09:07,757 --> 03:09:08,722
MARISHA: And I just say

3157
03:09:08,722 --> 03:09:11,940
I knoooow. 
Um, Vex.

3158
03:09:11,940 --> 03:09:13,551
LAURA: What?

3159
03:09:13,551 --> 03:09:16,637
TALIESIN: One moment, sir. Huddle.

3160
03:09:16,637 --> 03:09:22,983
MARISHA: Huddle. Is 50,000 dollars worth dealing
with this annoying piece of shit?

3161
03:09:22,983 --> 03:09:24,966
LAURA: While we go drop off a hand?

3162
03:09:24,966 --> 03:09:32,910
MARISHA: Look, it just feels like when your guinea
pig dies as a kid and then you immediately get

3163
03:09:32,910 --> 03:09:37,745
another guinea pig to replace it? This doesn't
feel good.

3164
03:09:37,745 --> 03:09:38,707
TRAVIS: You don't like him, right?

3165
03:09:38,707 --> 03:09:39,999
LAURA: You think he's replacing Scanlan?

3166
03:09:39,999 --> 03:09:42,233
MARISHA: No! I just, I don't want another guinea
pig!

3167
03:09:42,233 --> 03:09:46,947
LAURA: This piece of shit would never replace
Scanlan.

3168
03:09:46,947 --> 03:09:56,744
MARISHA: He's a fabricator! He gets ghostwriters
to write all of his books, I bet he does!

3169
03:09:56,744 --> 03:09:57,781
LIAM: He's a schmuck.

3170
03:09:57,781 --> 03:10:00,339
TRAVIS: He probably does. Keyleth, you don't like
him very much, right?

3171
03:10:00,339 --> 03:10:04,913
MARISHA: I don't like new people right now,
as of yesterday!

3172
03:10:04,913 --> 03:10:11,828
TRAVIS: But like, 50,000 gold and we have ourself
a very flamboyant distraction if we need it.

3173
03:10:11,828 --> 03:10:14,808
LAURA: Think about it, for 50,000 gold, we're only
15,000 gold away

3174
03:10:14,808 --> 03:10:17,279
from getting one of those fucking
flaming swords!

3175
03:10:17,279 --> 03:10:23,537
SAM: While they're talking, I'm working on my rod.
Battleaxe!

3176
03:10:23,590 --> 03:10:25,653
LAURA: Look at how fucking cool that rod is!

3177
03:10:25,836 --> 03:10:27,582
TRAVIS: He's in. He's fucking in.

3178
03:10:27,582 --> 03:10:28,246
MARISHA: No!

3179
03:10:28,246 --> 03:10:30,564
TRAVIS: Look at the battle axe! Holy shit!

3180
03:10:30,564 --> 03:10:34,011
MARISHA: You guys, he's like the worst alter-ego
version of Percy!

3181
03:10:34,080 --> 03:10:37,687
He's a rich kid who just buys all of his
cool toys. No offense, Percy.

3182
03:10:37,733 --> 03:10:39,031
TALIESIN: None taken.

3183
03:10:39,031 --> 03:10:41,806
(all laugh)

3184
03:10:41,806 --> 03:10:44,637
MARISHA: It's true though! He's not legit!

3185
03:10:44,637 --> 03:10:49,604
LIAM: I don't like him either, but I'll just say
two words: Hotis bait.

3186
03:10:49,604 --> 03:10:51,413
TALIESIN: Yes, that's my thought.

3187
03:10:51,413 --> 03:10:52,679
LAURA: Maybe he is Hotis.

3188
03:10:52,679 --> 03:10:54,150
MARISHA: Oh yeah, what if he is Hotis?

3189
03:10:54,150 --> 03:10:55,650
TRAVIS: He's not.

3190
03:10:55,650 --> 03:10:57,511
MARISHA: How do you know, Grog?

3191
03:10:57,511 --> 03:10:58,511
LIAM: He hasn't tried to seduce me.

3192
03:10:58,511 --> 03:11:02,108
TRAVIS: I'm a dark wizard.

3193
03:11:02,108 --> 03:11:03,098
LAURA: I've always known.

3194
03:11:03,098 --> 03:11:06,196
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3195
03:11:06,196 --> 03:11:12,316
TALIESIN: I'm not going to pretend I'm not mildly
entertained by the distraction at the very least.

3196
03:11:12,316 --> 03:11:15,970
We just have to drop off a hand.

3197
03:11:15,970 --> 03:11:18,548
MARISHA: And then he's gonna take credit for
dropping off a hand,

3198
03:11:18,548 --> 03:11:21,563
like it's some crazy, miraculous thing!

3199
03:11:21,563 --> 03:11:22,836
LAURA: Let him take credit for the hand.

3200
03:11:22,836 --> 03:11:24,615
TALIESIN: Do you want credit for dropping off a
hand?

3201
03:11:24,615 --> 03:11:28,875
MARISHA: No! I don't care. It's the principle of
the matter!

3202
03:11:29,034 --> 03:11:33,709
TRAVIS: Is there a fighting arena in Marquet,
or anywhere

3203
03:11:33,709 --> 03:11:35,597
we could find a scrap if we wanted to?

3204
03:11:35,597 --> 03:11:39,932
MATT: I mean, I believe there is. Let me find the
name of it real fast.

3205
03:11:39,932 --> 03:11:44,928
TALIESIN: We also could report in to a certain
dragon about things that have happened.

3206
03:11:44,928 --> 03:11:49,182
LAURA: We actually need to because we promised
Jarett we would talk to J'mon.

3207
03:11:49,182 --> 03:11:52,238
LIAM: So many things to do.

3208
03:11:52,238 --> 03:11:53,696
TALIESIN: Let's just--

3209
03:11:53,696 --> 03:11:55,691
LIAM: While Grog's thinking about that, I pull him
aside and say

3210
03:11:55,691 --> 03:12:00,539
Did I ever show you I know how to
summon a dragon, d'you know how to do that?

3211
03:12:00,539 --> 03:12:01,279
TRAVIS: No.

3212
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:09,875
LIAM: Watch and learn from my hand symbols.
What do you think of that, big guy?

3213
03:12:09,875 --> 03:12:11,523
TRAVIS: And I grab his hands with the Titanstone
Knuckles--

3214
03:12:11,523 --> 03:12:12,524
LIAM: Ow! Ow!

3215
03:12:12,524 --> 03:12:13,369
TRAVIS: -- and squeeze.

3216
03:12:13,369 --> 03:12:15,874
LIAM: Jeepers creepers, you've killed my dragon!

3217
03:12:15,874 --> 03:12:16,632
MARISHA: Grog! Grog!

3218
03:12:16,632 --> 03:12:17,464
TRAVIS: Don't --

3219
03:12:17,464 --> 03:12:18,055
MARISHA: Grog! Grog!

3220
03:12:18,055 --> 03:12:19,485
TRAVIS: -- summon the dragon. Uh, what?

3221
03:12:19,485 --> 03:12:20,834
MARISHA: Grog, no, no, let go, Grog drop it,
Grog drop --

3222
03:12:20,834 --> 03:12:21,537
TRAVIS: -- baby dragon

3223
03:12:21,537 --> 03:12:23,756
MARISHA: Drop it, drop it, good boy!

3224
03:12:23,756 --> 03:12:26,228
LIAM: See if I ever do anything nice for you
again! Jeez!

3225
03:12:26,228 --> 03:12:29,199
TRAVIS: Well, I thought you were being taken over.
D'you need me to make sure you're all right?

3226
03:12:29,199 --> 03:12:30,222
TALIESIN: Very proud of you Grog.

3227
03:12:30,222 --> 03:12:33,179
LIAM: Will you kiss it? I thought so. And I walk
away.

3228
03:12:33,179 --> 03:12:40,105
MARISHA: Grog.

3229
03:12:40,105 --> 03:12:41,635
TRAVIS: He comes. C'mon.

3230
03:12:41,635 --> 03:12:42,645
LIAM: We are fucking slap-happy.

3231
03:12:42,645 --> 03:12:43,913
TALIESIN: C'mon then.

3232
03:12:43,913 --> 03:12:45,818
TRAVIS: Besides I wanna see him get in a fight,
let's audition him at least.

3233
03:12:45,818 --> 03:12:47,332
TALIESIN: Vex, let's let the money tag along.

3234
03:12:47,332 --> 03:12:48,036
LAURA: Yeah.

3235
03:12:48,036 --> 03:12:49,562
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

3236
03:12:49,562 --> 03:12:50,410
MARISHA: Okay, but I'm--

3237
03:12:50,410 --> 03:12:51,622
LAURA: C'mon, pretty boy, let's go.

3238
03:12:51,622 --> 03:12:52,985
MARISHA: -- gonna be pouty about this.

3239
03:12:52,985 --> 03:12:56,712
SAM: Doty, take this down. As the group turned
around, I knew I had them.

3240
03:12:56,712 --> 03:12:59,589
(all laugh)

3241
03:12:59,589 --> 03:13:02,410
SAM: And our adventure was about to begin.
End chapter.

3242
03:13:02,410 --> 03:13:03,790
(all laugh)

3243
03:13:03,790 --> 03:13:06,707
LAURA: I hate him so much!

3244
03:13:06,707 --> 03:13:08,219
MARISHA: I hate him so much!

3245
03:13:08,219 --> 03:13:09,128
TRAVIS: I love him.

3246
03:13:09,128 --> 03:13:10,441
LIAM: I miss Scanlan!

3247
03:13:10,441 --> 03:13:15,521
(all laugh)

3248
03:13:15,578 --> 03:13:19,518
MATT: As you guys decide against your better
judgment to

3249
03:13:19,518 --> 03:13:21,863
accept your companion for the time being--

3250
03:13:21,863 --> 03:13:23,222
LIAM: Don't like that word!

3251
03:13:23,222 --> 03:13:26,767
MATT: -- you make your way into the Debt's Respite
Tavern to meet with

3252
03:13:26,819 --> 03:13:30,866
Treev Bonebreaker and deliver the right hand.

3253
03:13:30,866 --> 03:13:33,443
LAURA: Wait, wait, I wanted that gold up front!

3254
03:13:33,443 --> 03:13:37,138
SAM: Oh! I don't carry 50,000 gold with me on my
person!

3255
03:13:37,138 --> 03:13:39,246
LAURA: Well, you carry platinum, how much do you
have?

3256
03:13:39,246 --> 03:13:41,057
SAM: I-- not--

3257
03:13:41,057 --> 03:13:43,728
LAURA: Doty, how much platinum does he have on him
right now?

3258
03:13:43,728 --> 03:13:44,629
SAM: Doty, go ahead and speak.

3259
03:13:44,629 --> 03:13:45,568
MATT: No response.

3260
03:13:45,568 --> 03:13:46,515
SAM: Go ahead, Doty, speak.

3261
03:13:46,515 --> 03:13:47,205
LAURA: Doty!

3262
03:13:47,205 --> 03:13:50,919
SAM: Oh, that's right, Doty can't speak.
Doty's a machine.

3263
03:13:50,919 --> 03:13:55,217
LAURA: Doty, show me the ledger. How much platinum
does he have on his person right now?

3264
03:13:55,217 --> 03:13:56,268
MATT: There's no response.

3265
03:13:56,268 --> 03:13:59,042
LIAM: (robot beeping sound effects)

3266
03:13:59,042 --> 03:14:04,786
SAM: Doty only listens to me. If you had some sort
of a pet, you would understand.

3267
03:14:04,786 --> 03:14:07,809
TRAVIS: (gasps) Oh, I'm gonna love Tary so much!

3268
03:14:07,809 --> 03:14:09,836
MARISHA: Vex! Vex, kick his ass!

3269
03:14:09,836 --> 03:14:10,608
TRAVIS: I'm gonna love him so much.

3270
03:14:10,608 --> 03:14:12,405
MARISHA: Kick his ass, Vex!

3271
03:14:12,405 --> 03:14:14,754
LAURA: Gold up front or you don't join us.

3272
03:14:14,754 --> 03:14:21,998
SAM: How about this? I'll give you a little
present, just for you, little elf girl. And I flip

3273
03:14:21,998 --> 03:14:29,011
her a silver coin that I have put a spell into.
I've put--

3274
03:14:29,011 --> 03:14:30,456
LAURA: I don't catch the coin.

3275
03:14:30,456 --> 03:14:32,413
MARISHA: You're like all the bad things about the
internet as a character.

3276
03:14:32,413 --> 03:14:34,941
LAURA: It's a piece of shit silver coin,
I don't need your stupid silver coin.

3277
03:14:34,941 --> 03:14:37,503
SAM: It's a special coin, you should pick it up.

3278
03:14:37,503 --> 03:14:38,615
TALIESIN: Did he flip the coin at her?

3279
03:14:38,615 --> 03:14:39,365
MATT: He did.

3280
03:14:39,365 --> 03:14:42,662
TALIESIN: I was thinking of intercepting it anyway
so--

3281
03:14:42,662 --> 03:14:44,623
MATT: Okay. It would be easy to do with your
Gloves of Missile Snaring.

3282
03:14:44,623 --> 03:14:46,931
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have Gloves of Missile Snaring.
I intercept it.

3283
03:14:46,931 --> 03:14:51,445
SAM: Well, that was for the elf girl but all
right, sure, you can use it too. When you need it,

3284
03:14:51,445 --> 03:14:57,941
if you just hold that coin up, you'll turn
invisible.

3285
03:14:57,941 --> 03:15:01,469
TRAVIS: Seriously? An invisible-making coin?

3286
03:15:01,469 --> 03:15:06,889
MARISHA: No! Grog, no! Do not show satisfaction in
the things he says.

3287
03:15:06,889 --> 03:15:08,455
TRAVIS: This is just my gut reaction though.

3288
03:15:08,455 --> 03:15:13,054
MARISHA. Even if you're impressed, we pretend like
we're not. Pretend like you're not impressed.

3289
03:15:13,054 --> 03:15:14,668
TALIESIN: I'm not saying I can't be bought--

3290
03:15:14,668 --> 03:15:15,684
LIAM: You said that very loud.

3291
03:15:15,684 --> 03:15:16,592
SAM: Hey, big man.

3292
03:15:16,592 --> 03:15:17,147
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3293
03:15:17,147 --> 03:15:20,266
SAM: Look at this. Heavy crossbow!

3294
03:15:20,266 --> 03:15:23,089
TRAVIS: It's the most amazing thing!

3295
03:15:23,089 --> 03:15:24,023
MARISHA: Grog!

3296
03:15:24,023 --> 03:15:28,792
TRAVIS: I mean, hold on! Not impressed.

3297
03:15:28,792 --> 03:15:30,200
SAM: You can shoot it!

3298
03:15:30,200 --> 03:15:31,022
TRAVIS: I wanna shoot it!

3299
03:15:31,022 --> 03:15:33,825
(all laugh)

3300
03:15:33,825 --> 03:15:34,657
TRAVIS: (bvvm!)

3301
03:15:34,657 --> 03:15:36,456
MATT: (tsoo!)

3302
03:15:36,456 --> 03:15:39,118
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh shit, take it back.

3303
03:15:39,118 --> 03:15:42,272
MATT: You have no idea where it went, it arced way
out of your line of sight.

3304
03:15:42,272 --> 03:15:45,363
SAM: That was pretty good.

3305
03:15:45,363 --> 03:15:46,121
TRAVIS: That's cool.

3306
03:15:46,121 --> 03:15:47,642
SAM: Yes!

3307
03:15:47,642 --> 03:15:49,875
TRAVIS: He stays.

3308
03:15:49,875 --> 03:15:53,572
TALIESIN: Let's get the hand to its final
destination.

3309
03:15:53,572 --> 03:15:55,321
LAURA: Ugh!

3310
03:15:55,321 --> 03:15:56,768
TRAVIS: Or you can kill him and take the weapon
later.

3311
03:15:56,768 --> 03:15:57,802
LAURA: I will.

3312
03:15:57,802 --> 03:16:05,493
LIAM: He's slow. None of the rest of us like you,
so fucking watch it, all right?

3313
03:16:05,493 --> 03:16:07,423
LAURA: We're such dicks!

3314
03:16:07,423 --> 03:16:15,179
SAM: And with that we embarked on our new
adventure! The adventures of, what was it again?

3315
03:16:15,179 --> 03:16:16,169
TALIESIN: (sighs)

3316
03:16:16,169 --> 03:16:18,021
LIAM: What a dillweed!

3317
03:16:18,021 --> 03:16:20,299
SAM: This is going to be fun, fun, fun!

3318
03:16:20,299 --> 03:16:23,671
(all laugh)

3319
03:16:23,671 --> 03:16:27,527
MATT: As you walk into the Debt's Respite Tavern,
we're gonna end tonight's session there and pick

3320
03:16:27,527 --> 03:16:28,429
this up next week.

3321
03:16:28,429 --> 03:16:36,481
(all cheer, groan, yell)

3322
03:16:36,481 --> 03:16:38,288
LIAM: You break our hearts and then pull that
asshole out?

3323
03:16:38,288 --> 03:16:42,900
LAURA: You asshole! How dare you? How dare you?

3324
03:16:42,900 --> 03:16:44,642
TALIESIN: Unbelievable!

3325
03:16:44,642 --> 03:16:45,655
MATT: Oh, it's beautiful.

3326
03:16:45,655 --> 03:16:49,426
LAURA: I am so angry at you!

3327
03:16:49,426 --> 03:16:53,182
MARISHA: You were on the Critical Role wikia last
night weren't you?

3328
03:16:53,182 --> 03:16:54,013
TRAVIS: Tary berry.

3329
03:16:54,013 --> 03:16:55,029
TALIESIN: Yes, he was, he has it all--

3330
03:16:55,029 --> 03:16:56,061
SAM: Tary Darrington.

3331
03:16:56,061 --> 03:16:59,021
LIAM: You ain't know all our characters' mothers'
names, you motherfucker.

3332
03:16:59,021 --> 03:17:00,306
SAM: I know all of your parents' names.

3333
03:17:00,306 --> 03:17:01,989
LIAM: After Googling that shit!

3334
03:17:01,989 --> 03:17:02,962
SAM: Because I love you!

3335
03:17:02,962 --> 03:17:03,943
LAURA: Whatever!

3336
03:17:03,943 --> 03:17:05,021
SAM: I love you so much!

3337
03:17:05,021 --> 03:17:07,947
LAURA: Sam you're the least-- you don't care about
any of it!

3338
03:17:07,947 --> 03:17:08,914
SAM: I am the most sincere!

3339
03:17:08,914 --> 03:17:10,980
LAURA: You're a dick!

3340
03:17:10,980 --> 03:17:12,610
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

3341
03:17:12,610 --> 03:17:14,277
LIAM: It was amazing, it was amazing.

3342
03:17:14,277 --> 03:17:16,952
TALIESIN: I love that-- I wish that everyone could
see that the crew is in

3343
03:17:16,952 --> 03:17:18,590
utter revolt behind us right now.

3344
03:17:18,590 --> 03:17:20,154
