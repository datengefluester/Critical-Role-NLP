1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:04,165
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:09,429
nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice, play Dungeons
and Dragons, and Liam once again throws curses at

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:13,034
me right before we start the stream. It's good, it's
good.

4
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:13,984
LIAM: I love you.

5
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:18,161
MATT: I love you too. Sam's on his way, he'll be
here shortly.

6
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:19,432
LIAM: Lies.

7
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:24,540
MATT: Hopefully. Possibly lies. He's a good liar,
as we know. But we've got a couple announcements

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,732
we want to get done before the show. First and
foremost, as a reminder, we're all flying out to

9
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,403
Portland tomorrow for Wizard World.

10
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:33,513
(cheering)

11
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,521
MARISHA: Getting on a plane!

12
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:35,571
TALIESIN: I gotta pack a bag!

13
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,324
MARISHA: Never unpacked it.

14
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:45,455
MATT: Looking forward to seeing you guys there
tomorrow. We have a panel tomorrow and on Sunday--

15
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:51,968
Saturday. My week, it's been a long week. Saturday
panel at 2PM, which will be--

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,798
LAURA: On the main gaming stage.

17
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:59,950
MATT: Yup. Main gaming stage. Also available
online at twitch.tv/wizardworld during our panel.

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,550
It will be hosted there for you guys to watch, who
can't be there in person.

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:10,837
LAURA: And in case you forget, you can always
follow Critical Role on Twitter, @criticalrole,

20
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:16,067
and the panels will be posted there, I mean, the
schedule, so you guys can find us. Or follow any

21
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,785
of us for our individual signing.

22
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:21,255
LIAM: We have a team of hundreds that man the
Twitter handle with information.

23
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,191
LAURA: Hundreds of twos, of threes.

24
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:25,599
TALIESIN: Like Bond villains.

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,699
LIAM: It's Marisha and I.

26
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,266
(laughter)

27
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,600
MARISHA: Mainly Liam. Mainly Liam.

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:39,829
MATT: Good use of henchmen, it works out well. So
look forward to that. Also, we have going up, it

29
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,843
should be on the store tonight--

30
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:43,079
LIAM: Sam's here!

31
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:52,557
MATT: Sam's here. On the store tonight, Sam's
here! He almost fell over. He made his dex save.

32
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:57,456
Everything's through the filter nowadays. It's
really bad. I have a serious problem. We have

33
00:01:57,456 --> 00:02:03,298
going up on the store tonight at Geek &amp; Sundry, we
have prints-- our Critical Role poster prints with

34
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:07,344
characters. We also have--

35
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:13,307
LAURA: A very limited run. It's very, very
limited, signed by the cast, so those are-- I don't

36
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:17,549
even know how many, but once they're gone, they're
gone, so yeah, those will be available for a short

37
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:18,889
amount of time.

38
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,061
Buy it right now!

39
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,311
MARISHA: Right now, on geekandsundry.com.

40
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,046
LAURA: Sam, you look different tonight.

41
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,065
SAM: I do?

42
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,182
LIAM: You look handsomer.

43
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,061
SAM: That is impossible.

44
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:32,378
MARISHA: I do like your shirt.

45
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:34,326
TALIESIN: It is a very nice shirt.

46
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:41,437
SAM: Hi guys, welcome to Critical Role, where we
nerdy-ass voice actors like to roll dice and play

47
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:46,124
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Oh, and Liam just threw some
curses at me right before we started.

48
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,194
(laughter)

49
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:50,233
MATT: We already-- we already covered all this.

50
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,757
SAM: Oh, sorry.

51
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:59,181
MATT: It's okay, it's good. Redundancy is good in
this industry. So, in that regard, also, we may

52
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:03,460
be, I think we're supposed to have more "How do
you want to do this?" shirts up. Supposed to be up

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,233
soon?

54
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:08,561
LAURA: Potentially soon. We're working on it.
There's some really cool stuff coming. Really cool

55
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,628
stuff.

56
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:13,741
SAM: We don't know what's coming, do we?

57
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:19,450
MATT: And also just a reminder to all of our
friends over in the Europe area, me and Marisha will

58
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:26,386
be guests at Kaizoku Con the first weekend of
March, in Cork, Ireland, so we're excited to go

59
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:41,072
and meet a bunch of Critters out there. Kaizoku. A
Gaelic mythological creature, the Kaizoku. So,

60
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:45,112
those are my base announcements, do we have
anything else anyone wants to mention on the stream?

61
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:47,900
TALIESIN: We have a thing. We got to announce a
thing this week.

62
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:49,514
MATT: What did we get to announce?

63
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:50,932
TALIESIN: We got to announce "Black Butler."

64
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:55,581
MATT: That's right! We have "Black Butler: Book of
Circus," they announced the cast, where Taliesin,

65
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,454
you play--

66
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:00,099
TALIESIN: Well, I'm in "Book of Murder," two
completely different butlers.

67
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,583
MATT: Right, it's a thing.

68
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:07,443
TALIESIN: I'm buttling in "Book of Murder" as Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, so that's exciting. It's the

69
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:10,947
weirdest accent I've ever done. It is all over the
place.

70
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:12,300
LIAM: "Oh, hallo"--

71
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,730
(laughter)

72
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,483
TRAVIS: Might beat that one.

73
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:22,801
MATT: In "Book of Circus," I play Joker. I'm
excited to jump into that little realm there, so

74
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,312
look forward to that.

75
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:30,239
LIAM: We are in an intimate relationship with
Wyrmwood Gaming and if you go to

76
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:37,059
wyrmwoodgaming.com and use the code "critrole,"
"critrole," you will get free shipping on these

77
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:40,121
beautiful boxes. They hold dice.

78
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:46,126
LAURA: They hold dice, they are magnetic, so they
stay closed, they hold your dice so well-- oh--

79
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:50,747
LIAM: Enchanted by witches.

80
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:53,824
MATT: (laughs) That's a beautiful presentation,
guys.

81
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:54,694
LAURA: Thank you.

82
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,028
MATT: I'm proud of each and every one of you.

83
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,975
LIAM: I went to NYU.

84
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,252
MATT: Hey, see.

85
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,133
MARISHA: I dropped out.

86
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:11,218
MATT: Anything else? Cool. We're good? All right,
let's dive into tonight's episode proper. So, last

87
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:18,317
we left off, the party Vox Machina, having
recently suffered their main city of Emon and one

88
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:24,313
of their initial towns where they began their
adventures in Westruun under attack from an entity

89
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:33,387
called the Chroma Conclave, a collection of allied
chromatic dragons, extremely powerful, ancient

90
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:38,902
across the board, it seems, is wreaking havoc
across all of Tal'Dorei. They managed to save a

91
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:47,047
few allies, make a few current, tenuous
relationships with the Clasp, and moved all of the

92
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:52,214
refugees that they had been keeping within
Greyskull Keep to Whitestone to keep them safe for

93
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:57,445
the time being, as that town had seemingly been
passed over by the dragons that are still heading

94
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:04,508
east across the continent. After that, the party
made their way to Vasselheim. Vasselheim, the

95
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:10,612
distant city known as the Cradle of Faith, the
oldest living beacon of civilization in the world

96
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:16,759
that is currently known. After making their way
there, the party made their way into the Guild of

97
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,317
the Slayer's Take, where they had previously
signed on after a trial and are members of, to

98
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:28,172
seek more allies throughout the city of Vasselheim
in hopes of preparing themselves to retake Emon,

99
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:34,436
possibly Tal'Dorei at some point in the near
future. That is where we left off. As you guys

100
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:42,395
have spent some time resting within the actual--
we've got whispers going around over here already, and we

101
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:43,362
haven't started.

102
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,754
MARISHA: Do you want to say?

103
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:45,828
SAM: No.

104
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,776
MARISHA: No thank you, keep going.

105
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:55,556
MATT: Okay. Two can play at that game. So, as you
guys take a little bit of time, getting

106
00:06:55,556 --> 00:07:03,008
reacquainted with the Guild Hall of the Slayer's
Take, setting your stuff down that you need to prepare

107
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:09,222
for a short period of time staying in the city or
longer if need be. You ran briefly into Mertin

108
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:16,136
Cyndrial, the husband of Vanessa, who's the
Huntmaster of the entire Guild, and had a brief

109
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:20,785
conversation with Aldor, who was beating Thorbir
at cards.

110
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,005
LAURA: What a dick.

111
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:22,869
LIAM: Love that guy.

112
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,197
MATT: He's a nice fella.

113
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:27,807
LAURA: Not Thorbir, he's great.

114
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:34,603
MATT: There you go. Not very good with dice. So,
that being the case, what would you guys like to

115
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,593
do at this point in time?

116
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:39,320
LAURA: I don't know, I'm just asking you guys.

117
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,107
MARISHA: So we slept and we woke up?

118
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:48,443
MATT: You just arrived now, it's mid-dayish at
this point. Early morning to mid-day.

119
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:52,228
LIAM: Yeah, we slept at the Slayer's Take, we
talked to Aldor for a minute, right?

120
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:55,734
MATT: You haven't slept, you've arrived, it's like
morning, mid-day now. You've just situated

121
00:07:55,734 --> 00:08:02,709
yourselves in the Guild. You had an evening's
rest before you came here. But you have used your

122
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,826
7th-level spell to get here.

123
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:06,616
MARISHA: Yes. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:09,944
MATT: So what is the plan?

125
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:11,844
LIAM: Is there one?

126
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:20,236
TALIESIN: I'm, at this point, prepared for some
decompression of some kind. No one can be expected

127
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:32,345
to move at the speeds we've been moving at for the
past week. Perhaps grab an early-morning drink and

128
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,253
find out how much news has actually reached this
town about what's happening out in the world right

129
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,199
now.

130
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,606
LIAM: That's a good idea, Percy.

131
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:40,413
LAURA: We need to find Lady Kima.

132
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,073
TALIESIN: That's actually an even better idea.

133
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:43,442
SAM: That's a fantastic idea.

134
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,827
TALIESIN: Perhaps she will go to breakfast.

135
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,747
LAURA: She's at the Temple of Bahamut?

136
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:48,538
LIAM: Yes.

137
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,606
TALIESIN: That sounds right.

138
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,855
SAM: Percy.

139
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:51,789
TALIESIN: Yes?

140
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:58,725
SAM: Can I just remind you, for no other reasons
than to be helpful to you in the game and no other

141
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:05,028
reason, that the black powder salesman lives here.
Just throwing it out there, you might need some

142
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:05,954
supplies.

143
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:10,036
TALIESIN: It's interesting, because I sleep at
night and these voices from nowhere consistently

144
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:13,417
remind me that there's a black powder merchant in
this--

145
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:19,557
LIAM: What game are you talking about? We don't
have time for games, there are dragons that need

146
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,625
dealing with.

147
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,281
SAM: You're right. How silly of me.

148
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:25,746
LIAM: Stick to music, please. We don't need
games.

149
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:28,929
TALIESIN: Kima, I think, is an excellent idea.

150
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,261
SAM: Kima is a great idea.

151
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,081
MATT: Last I heard, Victor was blown apart.

152
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,595
LAURA: We also need-- oh.

153
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:38,313
MATT: You don't know.

154
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:40,724
LAURA: We also need supplies.

155
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:43,104
SAM: Oh, yes. Hell yes. I don't have anything.

156
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,551
LAURA: We need lots of potions, health potions.

157
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,185
SAM: Yeah, but they sell those here?

158
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,489
LAURA: They sell health potions here. Yeah.

159
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,663
MATT: You've purchased them in the past.

160
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:53,258
LAURA: Yeah, they sell them here.

161
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:58,982
MATT: Remember, that's where Grog had his
fantastic bartering skills last time to acquire a

162
00:09:58,982 --> 00:09:59,917
few potions.

163
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,374
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm an investment banker.

164
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:05,534
LAURA: That's right. Oh, that merchant might be
here still. We have so many things to catch up

165
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:06,487
on.

166
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:09,486
MARISHA: We can also talk to the Slayer's Take as
well.

167
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:18,170
LAURA: We're just waiting for Vanessa and Zahra to
get back from their hunt. Am I right?

168
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,739
MATT: Yeah.

169
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:22,136
SAM: Who? Oh, the wife?

170
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:26,124
LIAM: Yeah, Merkel's wife.

171
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:31,240
MARISHA: I didn't meet Zahra.

172
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,375
LAURA: No, you didn't.

173
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,524
TRAVIS: She's got a tail!

174
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:37,901
LAURA: She's quite wonderful.

175
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,216
SAM: She's very powerful.

176
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:43,586
LAURA: She's actually related to-- well, Percy,
you would know.

177
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:46,439
SAM: She's related to Percy? I don't see the
resemblance.

178
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:51,874
TALIESIN: No, she's related to Lillith. They
actually are, they are related, that is true. Our

179
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,794
friend from previously.

180
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,787
LAURA: Yes, our friend. From previously.

181
00:10:55,787 --> 00:11:05,061
TALIESIN: With that, let's find Kima, perhaps.
That would be the best course of action.

182
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:07,789
MATT: So you guys are going to head towards the--

183
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:11,368
LIAM: Do you think Kima wants to go
potion-shopping? Maybe we should go get some shit

184
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:14,281
and then see Kima? I think Kima would be a little
impatient.

185
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:16,033
TALIESIN: That may actually be a good point.

186
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:21,506
LAURA: All right, all right, all right, all right.
Let's go really fast. There's dragons in the

187
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,433
world, we don't have time to shop.

188
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,426
TRAVIS: Can you slam down an hourglass for
shopping?

189
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:30,580
LIAM: Sister, dear, how much coin do we have at
the moment?

190
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,611
LAURA: Well, not a ton.

191
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,621
LIAM: How many Pop-Tarts do we have?

192
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:38,745
LAURA: We have a lot of Pop-Tarts, but not very
many gold pieces.

193
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:45,727
LIAM: In the party, if anyone's holding coin,
because I don't have much at all. I don't need

194
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:48,637
much, but we do need healing potions.

195
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:52,026
LAURA: I have enough in the party funds to buy
some healing potions, so I think--

196
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:54,409
TALIESIN: Is that including what we got from my
sister?

197
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,280
LAURA: Yes, it is.

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,344
TALIESIN: Let's buy some potions.

199
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,764
LIAM: You're in charge, let's go.

200
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:06,044
MATT: All right, as you guys heads towards the
front door of the Slayer's Take Guild Hall, you're

201
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:11,376
but feet from it before the door slams open as the
cold winter wind comes pouring in.

202
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,941
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

203
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:19,243
MATT: There, standing in the doorway, you see the
outer frame of a strong female form, dark

204
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:28,747
brownish-black leathers, you can see tousled dark
hair, piercing pupil-less eyes, and there stands

205
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:35,387
Huntmaster Vanessa, clutching a bag that's
seemingly dampened at its base in her right hand

206
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:42,441
as she steps into the main foyer, looking about
all of you gathered in the front area. "Well,

207
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:46,006
"isn't this a nice surprise in the middle of the
morning? Ah."

208
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,216
LAURA: Welcome back.

209
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:52,381
MATT: "A pleasure to see you all. Ah, hold on. The
rest of you, inside, where it's warmer." And as

210
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:58,162
she steps inside, you see two individuals step out
of the shadows behind her. One of which is another

211
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:04,856
tiefling female, white hair, red in skin, and
another individual, familiar to some of you:

212
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:11,134
human, short brown shoulder-length hair, series of
scars across his arm, carrying a shield and spear,

213
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:14,932
as Kashaw and Zahra come in to accompany--

214
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,897
TRAVIS: Get your ass in here!

215
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:25,391
MARY: Look what the bear brought in. Hello,
darling.

216
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,955
SAM: Where do I go?

217
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:33,918
WILL: I'm going to sneak through.

218
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:41,446
MARY: Hello. Have you gotten bigger?

219
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,621
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've been lifting lots of horses and
mules and stuff.

220
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,942
MARY: Oh, my goodness. Hello, darling.

221
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,954
LAURA: Good to see you.

222
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,378
MARY: It's good to see you, too.

223
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:52,452
LAURA: How are things?

224
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,639
MARY: I'm all right.

225
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,562
TALIESIN: Once you're in, you're stuck.

226
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:58,504
WILL: Hello.

227
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,639
TALIESIN: Hello.

228
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,403
SAM: You said your name was Ka-SHAW?

229
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:02,856
WILL: It's KASH-aw.

230
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:07,333
LAURA: KASH-aw. Like cash. I like it.

231
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,225
MARISHA: Hi.

232
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:10,349
WILL: How are you?

233
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:15,150
MARISHA: What are you doing here?

234
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,968
WILL: This is kind of where I live. What are you
doing here?

235
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:25,573
MARISHA: Just, you know, rolling through. Passing
by. Not much.

236
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,342
WILL: Okay, who're--?

237
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:28,631
MARY: Kash, is that--?

238
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,488
WILL: This is her, Z.

239
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:32,069
LAURA: This is the guy?

240
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:34,286
MARISHA: Vex, Vex, Vex! Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex!

241
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,302
LAURA: What?

242
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,972
MARISHA: I push Vex out of the way.

243
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:40,383
LAURA: (laughs) You called me over to push me.

244
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,510
MARISHA: Yes.

245
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,376
WILL: You're Vex.

246
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:44,461
LAURA: I am Vex.

247
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:49,416
WILL: Oh, thank the gods. Yeah, he said you guys
looked very similar and thankfully it's not too

248
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,372
much, or I felt bad for you.

249
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:53,765
MARY: Yes, you do look very similar. Does that
mean you're--?

250
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,224
LAURA: He's my twin brother.

251
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,835
MARY: It's so lovely to meet you. I whack him with
my tail.

252
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:59,629
LIAM: Oh, jeez!

253
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,384
LAURA: She does that.

254
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:02,872
LIAM: You are impressive.

255
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:10,862
WILL: You are a big-- I recognize you. Wait a
second. I won 75 gold pieces at the Crucible when

256
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,507
I bet on Kern the Hammer.

257
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:15,854
TRAVIS: You did?! That was money well spent, my
friend.

258
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:18,292
WILL: Thank you for that night, by the way.

259
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,701
TRAVIS: You're very welcome. These are my lackeys,
I have a band of-- you know, wandering--

260
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,613
MARISHA: Lackeys?

261
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,407
LAURA: He doesn't realize that you bet against
him.

262
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:31,622
LIAM: I would not bring-- good to see you again--
I wouldn't bring that up.

263
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,499
WILL: It was a wonderful fight, did you see it?

264
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,252
TRAVIS: It was, did you see me power-bomb him at
the end?

265
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:37,340
MARY: Hello Percy.

266
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,884
TALIESIN: Lovely to see you again. It's been a
complicated month, we'll get into it.

267
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,842
MARY: How are the weapons holding up?

268
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:48,573
TALIESIN: Quite-- well, hmm. Liquefied, but mostly
functioning.

269
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,768
Hello, I don't think we've met. Percy
Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.

270
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:53,760
And you are?

271
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,889
WILL: Wh-what? Confused. Can you say that again?

272
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,972
TALIESIN: Just call me Percy.

273
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:59,389
WILL: Okay. Kashaw Vesh.

274
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,750
SAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

275
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,949
WILL: How are you?

276
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:06,267
SAM: It's nice to meet you. I've heard many a tale
of your wit and bravery.

277
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:10,322
TALIESIN: <i>That</i> Kashaw, oh! Yes, that one! Yes,
of course.

278
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:14,518
LAURA: We've heard so many things about you,
Kash.

279
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,206
WILL: Hopefully all good, thank you.

280
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:18,296
TRAVIS: (laughs, then coughs)

281
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,645
WILL: Is he choking?

282
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:21,936
TRAVIS: I'm good.

283
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,555
MARISHA: And you must be Zahra!

284
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:26,986
MARY: I am. And you are Keyleth, is that right?

285
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,594
MARISHA: That's right, yeah, yeah.

286
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:30,511
MARY: You are beautiful, aren't you?

287
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,800
MARISHA: (stutters)

288
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
MARY: Sorry.

289
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,762
SAM: I told her, I told her.

290
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:36,601
MARY: Yes.

291
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:39,430
MATT: At which point, Vanessa groans, staring at
this display.

292
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,621
SAM: Oh, sorry.

293
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,818
LAURA: Sorry.

294
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:45,751
MATT: "I hope this has worked out well for all of
you, I however, have a bit of business of ours to

295
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:46,753
"finish, okay?"

296
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:47,613
MARY: Yes, we do.

297
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:48,586
LIAM: Hey, what's in that bag?

298
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:49,713
TRAVIS: Yeah, what'd you catch?

299
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:53,410
MATT: She walks up to the table where Mertin's
standing, he reaches out to greet her, with arms

300
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,446
extended. She throws it into his arms, he catches
it, pulls it open. You see within there is a head

301
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:07,267
of what looks like a humanoid head, but the skin
is greyish and featureless. The eyes are whitish

302
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:18,387
and milky. What hair is there, in wisps, is white
in color. Who here is trained in arcana?

303
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,840
MARY: I think I am.

304
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,085
SAM: I am.

305
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:23,765
MATT: You know what this is.

306
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:26,178
MARY: I already know.

307
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,231
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

308
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,537
LAURA: Why don't we ask you, then?

309
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:30,465
SAM: 21.

310
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:35,688
MATT: 21. This is the head of a Doppelganger. This
is a creature that spends a lot of its time

311
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:40,544
infiltrating society, being able to take the form
and shape of other individuals to assume their

312
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:45,885
position, to take their wealth, to do all sorts of
sometimes interesting or dastardly things.

313
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:48,043
WILL: Made him a bitch to find.

314
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,213
MARY: Yeah.

315
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:50,793
SAM: It's a shapeshifter?

316
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:51,674
MATT: Yep.

317
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:53,183
SAM: What can you do with the head?

318
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:59,025
MATT: "Well, turn it in for the money it's worth.
Spread the change and forget about it."

319
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:01,087
TALIESIN: How do you know when you have one?

320
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,215
SAM: That's true.

321
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:03,783
TRAVIS: And what was it posing as?

322
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,238
TALIESIN: And at that point, don't you just
already have one at that point?

323
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:10,057
MATT: "Well, this is for me to worry about. Not
for you to care."

324
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,169
LAURA: Vanessa, I have a question.

325
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:13,237
MATT: "Yes, please."

326
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:19,067
LAURA: Do you ever hunt creatures just because
they're evil and they're killing people?

327
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:25,384
MATT: "Generally, somebody will eventually be
paying for such a creature to be hunted, so I do

328
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:28,388
"not feel the necessity to do it, without--"

329
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:32,049
LAURA: What if lots of people are dying and you
might be at risk as well?

330
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,769
MATT: "Then I think it should be very easy to
convince someone to pay for it."

331
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:36,950
LAURA: Okay.

332
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,112
MARISHA: What if the cost is the end of the
world?

333
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:44,730
MATT: "Well, I imagine that would be quite a
terrible thing."

334
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,344
MARISHA: Sure. That's what we're looking at here.

335
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:48,643
MARY: Really?

336
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:57,935
LAURA: Okay, so. Vasselheim is unaware of what's
going on, but a lot of cities have been

337
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,344
destroyed.

338
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:02,027
WILL: Cities. Multiple, cities? Have been
destroyed?

339
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:04,200
LAURA: Multiple cities. Emon was the first one
hit.

340
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,897
WILL: It's <i>gone</i>?

341
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:09,334
LAURA: Well, it's still there technically, just
crumbled.

342
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:10,586
TALIESIN: And flat.

343
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:14,340
MARISHA: And under rule by an ancient red dragon.

344
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,961
MARY: So much has changed since Lillith was
there.

345
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:18,271
LAURA: So much.

346
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,169
MARY: How did this happen?

347
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,436
LAURA: He escaped. He'd been trapped in the fire
plane, and--

348
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:29,798
TALIESIN: We're not entirely sure what happened,
but he escaped the fire plane and somehow created

349
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,741
a coalition of chromatic dragons and they are
ravaging the countryside.

350
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,588
LAURA: Yes. Which is very strange.

351
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,066
MARY: What color?

352
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,307
WILL: How many?

353
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:46,123
LAURA: Red, white, green, black, blue was one of
them at a time.

354
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:49,375
MARISHA: They call themselves the Chroma
Conclave.

355
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,006
TRAVIS: Eight total.

356
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:53,427
MARY: The Chroma Concl-- there were eight?

357
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:55,531
LAURA: There's four of them. There's four of
them.

358
00:19:55,531 --> 00:20:01,908
MARISHA: No, you're-- you don't double them by
city. It's just one city-- No, never mind. Just

359
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:02,987
one dragon.

360
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,635
TRAVIS: One, three, five, eight.

361
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:09,982
MATT: Vanessa's crossed her arms and thinks for a
second and she goes, "Ah, if what you say is true,

362
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:20,272
"this is very unfortunate. And a bit larger than
what our simple guild could even hope to really

363
00:20:20,272 --> 00:20:23,669
"help. This would be something to take to the
various temples."

364
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:30,576
LAURA: Yes, and we plan on it, but we know that
the Slayer's Take is full of very strong, very

365
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:34,590
qualified fighters and we were hoping to have you
at our side as well.

366
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:46,242
MATT: "Well. Let me put it this way. If what you
say is true, multiple incredibly powerful ancient

367
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:51,451
"dragons roaming, destroying-- this is not
something you can throw yourself at until

368
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:59,684
"eventually one or the other falls. You have to
find a weakness, you have to find the way to be on

369
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:07,764
"their level. Ask around. See what other allies you
can find."

370
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,186
LIAM: Yes.

371
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,909
LAURA: A metallic dragon.

372
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:14,020
TALIESIN: Temple of Bahamut.

373
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,232
LIAM: What you say is correct. These are the first
moments after us finding out, this is a first

374
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:30,283
step. But being members here and seeing what your
people can do [no audio] I know this is just a

375
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:35,116
first step, and we're about to enter Vasselheim
proper, but--

376
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:40,574
MARISHA: It should speak pretty loudly that we
came to you first. That's how much we trust you.

377
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:43,461
LIAM: Can we count on you?

378
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:53,143
MATT: (sighs) "I am Huntmaster of the Slayer's
Take. I deal in contracts, I deal in business, I

379
00:21:53,143 --> 00:22:01,481
"deal in the hunting of relatively unorganized
creatures. This-- this is beyond me. That is not

380
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:07,374
"to say I would not be willing to help, but there
are many things to consider first. Perhaps you

381
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:12,689
"should speak with Osysa."

382
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:14,312
SAM: What, who?

383
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:15,867
MATT: "Osysa."

384
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,921
SAM: Osysa?

385
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,226
LIAM: The sphinx.

386
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:21,573
MATT: "Our patron of Ioun."

387
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,823
LAURA: Okay.

388
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:27,716
MATT: "She would have a better mind for this than
me, this is..."

389
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:29,709
LAURA: How do we talk to her?

390
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,776
MATT: "The same way you did last time."

391
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,673
LAURA: Yes.

392
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:33,791
MATT: "Follow me."

393
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,632
MARY: Before we go, I believe we have a little
settling-up to do?

394
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:38,904
WILL: I'm cold and I still haven't been paid.

395
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:43,745
MATT: "My apologies. Mertin!"

396
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:47,983
He's over there, he's currently putting the head
into a small case and closing up and he goes,

397
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:52,996
"Aye, not to worry I'll be more than happy to get
this for you." And he leaves for a second, comes

398
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,851
back, goes through the contract, reads a couple
things. Pulls out a large chest and begins

399
00:22:56,851 --> 00:23:02,704
divvying up coin and throws a satchel to each of
you that contains, for both of you divided for

400
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:07,350
this contract that would come to 2,250 gold
pieces.

401
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,786
MARY: Pleasure, as always.

402
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:12,179
SAM: They have more than we do.

403
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,239
LAURA: No, they don't.

404
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:19,033
MARY: Thank you very much.

405
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:20,849
MATT: "Of course, that's what I'm here for!"

406
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:24,426
MARY: It was an interesting challenge, thank you.
We had a rather good time with that one.

407
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:27,053
WILL: Interesting trying to track it down, that's
for damn sure.

408
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:29,951
TRAVIS: What was it hiding as, by the way?

409
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:37,562
MARY: A plethora of different entities and beings,
it was running around town changing at will.

410
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:39,925
LAURA: Isn't that like that rakshasa you were
talking about?

411
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,895
MARISHA: It seems familiar, actually.

412
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:44,192
WILL: Does sound familiar. That was interesting
and bloody!

413
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:45,498
MARISHA: Yup!

414
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:55,463
MATT: "Regardless... Shall we? Very well." And she
begins walking further to the back of the guild

415
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:59,253
hall, where you come to the same doorway that you
previously entered with her before. The chains in

416
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:04,091
the side, that sets up a large slab that leads to
a staircase that leads to the subterranean area

417
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:10,776
right beneath the Slayer's Take. You may have
noticed it previously, but there is a structure

418
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:19,239
above where the subterranean area is, behind the
Slayer's Take. And it's-- it looks like a very

419
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:26,359
simple temple. You haven't really gone into it,
but as you step down into this dark area

420
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:32,496
underneath you can see the sconces lighting along
with you as you step into this dark cavern. As it

421
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:40,136
opens up once again, you can see the remnants of
this hidden temple to Ioun, the Goddess of

422
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:44,835
Knowledge. And what's curious about this temple is
Ioun is a goddess of knowledge and openness. One

423
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:50,074
of her main astute pushes is the fact that
knowledge is to be shared and spread, so it's

424
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:59,928
curious to see that something of hers is hidden.
There's probably a purpose to that. Pushing up the

425
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:08,331
steps again, Vanessa puts her hand up and tells
you all to stop and calls out again. "Osysa! I

426
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:14,589
"apologize to bother you, but we have a predicament
that I believe requires your attention."

427
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:24,050
As a moment passes, where once again you hear the
low, rumbling growl in the shadows. (growls) You

428
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:31,438
hear slams of giant footfalls across stone as what
little bit of light torches begin to spark to life

429
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:37,975
around the top of this platform, this stone
platform. And at the very top of this staircase

430
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:45,021
that leads to the top of where this platform ends,
you can see standing above it a very large female

431
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:50,581
sphinx with a lion body, a female head adorned
with golden jewels around the neck, eyes that are

432
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:57,431
light sky blue and white in color. Proud as these
giant griffin-like wings stretch out and the

433
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:09,445
entity comes to rest at the top, paws folded over
the edge. "Yes, I recall. So what do you need of me?"

434
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,664
LAURA: Well.

435
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:13,903
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it, Vex.

436
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:20,212
LAURA: Your help, potentially. The world is under
attack.

437
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:29,703
MATT: The head sinks for a moment. "I have been
watching by the heartstone, naught but this past

438
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:39,974
"day I have been keeping tabs in hopes that such a
cataclysm would not find its way to my mate. It

439
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:49,040
"has not. So. Being aware of this, what do you
ask?"

440
00:26:49,040 --> 00:27:01,492
LAURA: Is there anything that you know of that
could help us defeat these ancient beings?

441
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:11,428
MATT: She thinks for a second, steps up and closes
her eyes. As her muscles tense, her eyes open

442
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:19,555
again, that color flashing with this luminescent
blue color. And her voice falls even deeper into

443
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:27,065
her register, and almost has this monotone
informative projection that says: "The Vestiges of

444
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:35,383
"Divergence, relics wielded when the gods walked
and fought alongside their creations." The light

445
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:40,799
fades from the eyes, for a second she catches
herself and steps back.

446
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:49,731
MARY: May I ask, what are the Vestiges of
Divergence?

447
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:59,129
MATT: She shakes her head. "I am a channel for
this knowledge, but the best I can understand,

448
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:12,167
"they are old relics of the War of the Divergence.
Leading into the penance, the Second Spark. These

449
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:20,520
"were armaments. Objects of great power that were
used in these wars against the gods, good and

450
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:29,316
"dark. Many have been buried, entombed, lost,
forgotten. The few that are recovered are passed

451
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:39,465
"on through blood lines, through symbols of power
and of seats of great political importance. But

452
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:43,966
"the actual information is lost to me."

453
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:50,193
LAURA: Do you know of any one in particular?

454
00:28:50,193 --> 00:29:04,023
MATT: She concentrates for a second. "Not within
my field of vision. Objects of this powerful

455
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:11,166
"enchantment are also prone to want to keep
themselves hidden."

456
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,210
LAURA: That's convenient.

457
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:24,136
MARISHA: Osysa. If you are aware of this
knowledge, then you know that Vasselheim is one of

458
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:32,240
the only remaining cities still left standing. Are
there any other services you can offer to help us

459
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,449
fight this?

460
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:45,747
MATT: "The danger that you run here is that
Vasselheim has stood the test of time and survived

461
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:57,059
"two possible ends of civilization as we know it.
But it has survived both of these events because

462
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,697
"those who guard it stayed to guard it.

463
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:09,315
"You may be hard-pressed to convince others to
step beyond the walls knowing that such a danger

464
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:18,516
"could use that to their advantage and destroy the
greatest city that we know of. You are welcome to

465
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:30,340
"ask, but it will be a difficult journey. What I
can offer, though: my mate is a keeper of much

466
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:44,721
"hidden knowledge, over on his side of Tal'Dorei. I
may be able to send you to him to seek this

467
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:46,712
"information."

468
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,754
LAURA: Much hidden knowledge?

469
00:30:48,754 --> 00:30:52,113
SAM: About these Vestiges, perhaps?

470
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:56,352
LAURA: Does he serve your same god? Or another?

471
00:30:56,352 --> 00:31:01,856
MATT: "I am one of the chosen of Ioun. He does not
serve her directly."

472
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:12,167
LIAM: Information is welcome and we are thankful.
And we have been impressed by your wisdom, very

473
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:22,231
much so. The people you employ are chosen very
carefully and very well and we all have been

474
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:37,612
impressed. In addition to information, you provide
a service with the Slayer's Take to Vasselheim. Do

475
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:44,384
you have any interest in spreading that influence
to Emon, if we can save it?

476
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:52,875
MATT: Her large paws cross once again, and she
looks at you with a stern expression. "There is

477
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:59,622
"great danger and darkness in this world, and there
are many fools who stand up in hopes that they

478
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:06,190
"can keep it at bay. If we were to lend our power
to you, I would ask that you prove yourselves the

479
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,571
"ones that could carry this torch."

480
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:12,101
LIAM: How so?

481
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:19,086
MATT: "Perhaps find these relics. Gather other
allies. Prove to me that I would not be sending my

482
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:28,139
"people to their doom. Then return. Perhaps then,
when you think you are ready, we could lend our

483
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:30,307
"guild to your service."

484
00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:31,841
LAURA: All right.

485
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:35,278
MARISHA: And where does your partner reside?

486
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:44,118
MATT: She closes her eyes and concentrates for a
moment. "South of the Frostweald, the mountain

487
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:53,100
"range that guards it." Her eyes open again.
"Understand that it is our nature to present

488
00:32:53,100 --> 00:33:07,870
"challenges. Part of his journey to seek him is to
find him yourself. That is the first step."

489
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,407
MARISHA: Does he have a name?

490
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:14,012
MATT: "It is his name to give."

491
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:19,937
LAURA: One small question, Osysa, I'm sorry.

492
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:21,011
LIAM: No, no.

493
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:25,844
LAURA: You serve the goddess of knowledge, of
openness.

494
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:31,088
MATT: And she steps back and you see the crystal
sphere, the heartstone that she once helped you

495
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:36,925
look through before to look back at the world,
glows beneath framing light under her form.

496
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,186
"Yes."

497
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:45,510
LAURA: Does that mean you would know anything of
the god of secrets: Vecna?

498
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:55,550
MATT: As you say that name, she snarls. (roars)
"It would do you right to not mention that name in

499
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,518
this place."

500
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,223
LAURA: I apologize.

501
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:01,584
MATT: "Yes, I know of him."

502
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:05,503
TALIESIN: His touch has been felt in the north.

503
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:18,725
LAURA: Very close to here, actually. Would you
know of a way to rid ourselves of his weapon, of

504
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,167
his tool?

505
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:28,125
MATT: "If I did, we would have done so long ago.
This creature is one of the few entities that

506
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:37,451
"shrouds my vision. The limits of our sight, of the
things we seek to discover and unveil, are

507
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:43,843
"constantly balked by the veil of darkness he
throws over the world. He may have been held at

508
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:52,217
"bay, many thought destroyed hundreds of years ago,
but no, he stays. And he squeezes a stranglehold

509
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:57,527
"on everything we seek to accomplish."

510
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:07,241
LIAM: Well then, allow us to do you a service. We
have had dealings with his underlings. We have

511
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:18,048
knowledge, which we freely give. Freely. If it
does anything to help our case, winning your aid.

512
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:25,921
And we will seek your partner and we will find
your partner. We're not trying to score points, we

513
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:33,321
are trying to do right. Percival?

514
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:37,084
MATT: "What do you know?"

515
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:49,352
TALIESIN: Dark creatures attempted to, as best
that we can surmise, open a gate beneath the

516
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:51,345
castle of Whitestone.

517
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:55,363
MATT: "Whitestone." She steps back for a second,
her eyes flare up with energy again. You can see

518
00:35:55,363 --> 00:36:00,346
the heartstone embedded in the floor of the stone
glow even brighter and brighter as she puts her

519
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:10,495
paws in the side and peers into it. She begins to
mutter beneath her breath. "I can see the snowy

520
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:25,819
"north of Tal'Dorei, the castle. Beneath, one of our
corrupted temples, forgotten long ago."

521
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:28,125
TALIESIN: Your temples?

522
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:39,041
MATT: "The ziggurats were not of his construction.
But he took them." Her eyes wince for a moment.

523
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:51,583
Her head turns for a minute, her vision and face
staring in the distance. "I look out to follow the

524
00:36:51,583 --> 00:37:03,719
"anger, the swath of death and hatred. Those who
took Emon, they draw my gaze. Something is

525
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,209
"happening."

526
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:07,309
LAURA: Right now?

527
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,385
TALIESIN: What do you see?

528
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:13,888
MATT: "The path to Westruun, eastward."

529
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:18,226
LAURA: What's east of Westruun? Who has the map?

530
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:24,836
MATT: "Parts smoldering and left behind, the path
continues over the Lucidian Ocean, eastward beyond

531
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:33,481
"the shores of Wildemount." Her head looks up,
still staring off into the distance. "Into the

532
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:36,103
"Drimaulth Ravine.

533
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:45,619
"I see the floating islands of Draconia falling.
Crumbling. Gone.

534
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:58,012
"An army sundered. People ruined. The Conclave,
sated, returns towards your land once more." You

535
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:10,992
can see blood pouring out of one of her nostrils
now. The light dulls in her eyes and the

536
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:18,744
heartstone fades for a moment. She gathers
herself. "I peered too far beyond the veil that

537
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:25,908
"contains me, I'm sorry. My (pained grunt)--" She
plops down and is breathing a little heavy.

538
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:29,305
WILL: Can I heal you?

539
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:40,140
MATT: She takes a few steps down towards you.
"Brother Kashaw. It would be appreciated."

540
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:47,845
WILL: Puts his hand around the medallion. Closes
his eyes. Puts his hand out, touches her.

541
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:57,144
MATT: "Thank you." She steps up and bows her head
to you. She steps to the top of the temple once

542
00:38:57,144 --> 00:39:08,767
again. "I've seen this darkness you speak of under
Whitestone, and I shall speak out to our brethren

543
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:20,628
"of Ioun in hopes of discovering the nature of this
shadow. I'm sorry, I must rest."

544
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:22,463
TALIESIN: Of course.

545
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:27,695
LIAM: We thank you for your time. We are your
willing allies.

546
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:31,026
MATT: "Return when you have proven yourself."

547
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:33,419
MARY: We shall.

548
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:38,618
MATT: "When you think this Conclave could possibly
be felled beneath your weapons and might and

549
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:46,529
"will." She whips around the wings (whoosh) as the
torches atop the temple flare out and you can see

550
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:54,352
the edge of Osysa's form as she dives into the
shadow to the back of the temple. You can hear the

551
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:59,298
impact of giant footfalls against sand and then
silence.

552
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:03,946
LIAM: Zahra.

553
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,865
MARY: Yes?

554
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:17,419
LIAM: You said, "We shall." Have we convinced
you?

555
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:22,939
MARY: Knowing that there are four dragons, at
least--

556
00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:24,390
LAURA: At least.

557
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:34,860
MARY: Four to eight dragons, according to Grog,
out there. And after our dealings with Rimefang, I

558
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,248
cannot let this go. You know I cannot, Kash.

559
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:45,588
WILL: Z, this is fucking happy fun bunch over
here. They bring death with them everywhere they

560
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:47,337
go. This isn't our fight.

561
00:40:47,337 --> 00:40:49,023
MARY: Not all of them.

562
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:51,105
SAM: I don't kill very much at all.

563
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:52,511
WILL: Good to know.

564
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:54,348
TALIESIN: Didn't you kill the king of--?

565
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:56,444
WILL: Except for kings, all right.

566
00:40:56,444 --> 00:40:58,722
MARISHA: We just had a third-party perspective.

567
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,879
SAM: Yeah, I mean, she gave us a lot to "sphinx"
about.

568
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,629
(groaning)

569
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,333
TRAVIS: Wow.

570
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,387
SAM: No? No?

571
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,998
MARY: It's nice to know Burt Reynolds is still
around.

572
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:13,684
MATT: There's a very slow clap echoing into the
cavern, as Vanessa goes--

573
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:15,813
(laughter)

574
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:19,179
MATT: "And to think, I might have briefly missed
you."

575
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:22,783
(laughter)

576
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,662
LAURA: We should leave the temple.

577
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:31,541
SAM: Wait, did Osysa just tell us she could
possibly send us to her partner?

578
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,427
LAURA: She told us where he is, and we have to
find him.

579
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:36,046
SAM: Oh, <i>we</i> have to make our way.

580
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:39,777
WILL: You have to find the no-name guy who's going
to help you find the stuff that's hidden that

581
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:40,933
nobody knows where it is.

582
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,267
LAURA: I thought we were finding the stuff that's
hidden while we're finding him.

583
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:47,972
MARY: We will find her mate, he who is not named.

584
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,169
WILL: Well, as long as it's not convoluted.

585
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:52,681
MARISHA: He is south of the Frostweald, in the
mountains.

586
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:55,268
LAURA: I hate to thay this--

587
00:41:55,268 --> 00:41:57,009
LIAM: Yeth?

588
00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:00,341
MARY: Speak freely.

589
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:13,692
LAURA: So, these Vestiges are ancient, right?
Spread across the land. Wasn't Tiberius looking

590
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:23,197
for a bunch of objects of magic that his people
had sent him to find? Perhaps that's the reason

591
00:42:23,197 --> 00:42:27,714
Draconia was hit. Maybe they were trying to hide
these items.

592
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,214
TALIESIN: It's possible.

593
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,894
SAM: That's a big "what if?"

594
00:42:30,894 --> 00:42:42,472
LIAM: Do you really think the Mending Wheel, 
though, would help us against Thordak?

595
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:50,658
MARISHA: I feel like we'll know if it's an ancient
Vestige of Divergence.

596
00:42:50,658 --> 00:42:53,461
TALIESIN: This is good. This is a path for us to
walk.

597
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:59,255
MARY: So, Draconia is gone. Is that my
understanding?

598
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:01,722
TALIESIN: Well, most likely, yes.

599
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:03,349
MARY: What else is left?

600
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:06,279
LAURA: Vasselheim. Whitestone.

601
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,449
MARISHA: Zahra, Kash?

602
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:11,797
LAURA: Potentially Syngorn, even though it's
hidden.

603
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:15,015
MARY: Well, we can either stay here or we can--

604
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:17,129
LIAM: They're opting out of the conversation.

605
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:26,516
MARISHA: Have either of you been near Pyrah, in
the mountains east of here? Have any of you been

606
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:28,699
where the Fire Ashari reside?

607
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:31,286
MARY: I have not.

608
00:43:31,286 --> 00:43:32,565
WILL: No.

609
00:43:32,565 --> 00:43:34,717
TALIESIN: Going to have to make our way there,
eventually.

610
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:35,957
SAM: A lot to do.

611
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:37,750
LAURA: It's a lot to do.

612
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,711
SAM: Maybe we should split up into eight groups.

613
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:42,923
TALIESIN: Actually, 11 groups.

614
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:44,247
MARY: That would be 12.

615
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,682
LAURA: How many is that, Grog?

616
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:47,642
TRAVIS: Four.

617
00:43:47,642 --> 00:43:51,304
(laughter)

618
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:55,790
MARISHA: Do we know how far away the Frostweald is
from here?

619
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,837
MATT: The Frostweald is back in--

620
00:43:57,837 --> 00:43:58,860
LAURA: By Westruun.

621
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,958
MATT: South of Westruun.

622
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,749
MARISHA: Like where we started, right? In
Stillben.

623
00:44:01,749 --> 00:44:04,169
MATT: That was where you got the heart of the
nymph.

624
00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:06,174
MARISHA: That's not far from the Air Ashari,
correct?

625
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:08,329
LIAM: Do you think she's still there, Grog?

626
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:13,107
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, trust me. When you have Grog--
you never leave?

627
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:17,328
LIAM: Yeah, that's the expression, I'm pretty sure
that's the expression.

628
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:20,166
LAURA: We need to find Kima, we need to go to the
Temple of Bahamut.

629
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,489
SAM: Yes, you're right, yes.

630
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:25,008
LAURA: Talk to people that are capable of helping
us.

631
00:44:25,008 --> 00:44:29,400
LIAM: We need Kima. Potions first. I don't want to
bore Kima, then Kima. Yes?

632
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,375
LAURA: Hey, does the Slayer's Take have potions we
can just have? Don't they have like a supply room?

633
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,871
LIAM: It would be welcome.

634
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:44,009
MATT: "We have things we can provide, as you are
members."

635
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:45,515
LAURA: Oh good, yes.

636
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:47,818
MATT: "Mind you, not extremely active members as of
late, but..."

637
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:54,246
LAURA: But we will be. Think about the giant
amount of claws and teeth and eyeballs and leather

638
00:44:54,246 --> 00:44:55,322
wings and scales.

639
00:44:55,322 --> 00:44:56,706
LIAM: We're about to get really fucking active.

640
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:58,230
LAURA: We're going to be so fucking rich.

641
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,682
MARY: Think of the armor I could forge you from
red dragon parts.

642
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:03,865
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

643
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:09,287
LIAM: Can I give advantage if I go like this the
whole time?

644
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:11,491
MATT: No. That's closer to disadvantage.

645
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:14,496
(laughter)

646
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:16,493
LAURA: Oh, how about 12?

647
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:23,797
MATT: "Yes, I'll provide you with what we can.
Come with me."

648
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:25,927
MARISHA: Aw, she likes us.

649
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:28,996
LAURA: No, I could have gotten something really
badass if I had rolled better.

650
00:45:29,057 --> 00:45:33,363
MATT: So, you guys step up and you lead back to
the Slayer's Take guildhall. She snaps at Mertin,

651
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:39,784
whispers something in his ear, and he comes and
offers a small chest to you guys that contains two

652
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:41,766
potions of healing and one potion of greater
healing.

653
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:48,110
LAURA: Oh good, two potions! Vanessa--

654
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:52,169
LIAM: It's welcome, it's very welcome. Which way
is the potion shop from here?

655
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:54,881
MATT: "Go to the Quadroads."

656
00:45:54,881 --> 00:45:56,775
SAM: Quadroads, of course.

657
00:45:56,775 --> 00:45:58,498
LIAM: Yeah, we haven't been here--

658
00:45:58,498 --> 00:45:59,925
LAURA: In quite a while--

659
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:01,249
TALIESIN: As you know.

660
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:03,306
MATT: "I'm afraid your symbols have been getting
dusty."

661
00:46:03,306 --> 00:46:04,373
LAURA: Grog.

662
00:46:04,373 --> 00:46:05,321
TRAVIS: Hm?

663
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:07,120
LAURA: You don't have any potions left?

664
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,908
TRAVIS: No, I've got like, three potions.

665
00:46:08,908 --> 00:46:10,126
LAURA: Who doesn't have any potions?

666
00:46:10,126 --> 00:46:11,135
SAM: None.

667
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,104
LIAM: None.

668
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:13,903
MARISHA: Yeah, I have a couple.

669
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:16,277
LIAM: Hey, I'm squishy as hell, can I have one?

670
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:20,929
LAURA: You get the greater one. You get one, and
you get one.

671
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,366
TALIESIN: All right.

672
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,067
MARY: May I speak with Vanessa very quickly?

673
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:27,658
MATT: "Zahra, what can I do for you?"

674
00:46:27,658 --> 00:46:30,467
MARY: Kash, come with.

675
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,317
WILL: Kash walks over with her.

676
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:39,968
MARY: Vanessa, we've done many jobs together. And
I think we've been very loyal to you. We've

677
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:50,209
brought in a lot of money for you. My only request
is, is there anything extra? Are there any spare

678
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:57,554
potions, any amulets of protection, anything? You
know this is going to come to us.

679
00:46:57,554 --> 00:47:01,668
MATT: "And there is a lot of great money that
you've made that could pay for these things."

680
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:04,009
LIAM: (whispers) But her voice is so deep!

681
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:08,832
MATT: "I've given you already more than I needed
to. You can afford it. If you were broke and

682
00:47:08,832 --> 00:47:12,074
"asking me, maybe I'd be happy to ask, but I just
paid you quite a sum of money."

683
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:13,130
MARY: I know you did.

684
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,955
MATT: "I feel like I'm being taken advantage of."

685
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:18,717
WILL: That's not what we mean, you know that, come
on. Just give us free stuff.

686
00:47:18,717 --> 00:47:21,370
(laughter)

687
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:25,517
MARY: I meant no offense whatsoever. I mean you no
offense.

688
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:30,329
MATT: "And none is taken. However, I would say,
there is business to be had deeper in the city.

689
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:33,770
"You wish potions, there are those that purchase
them. I've already given you what I have and what

690
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,927
"you've earned."

691
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:36,422
MARY: And we thank you for that.

692
00:47:36,422 --> 00:47:37,722
MATT: "Very well."

693
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,023
LAURA: Thank you, Vanessa.

694
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:45,303
LIAM: Vanessa, hey. I'm not asking anything. We're
going to get you into Emon. That's a promise.

695
00:47:45,303 --> 00:47:48,327
MATT: "I look forward to you coming back and
proving me wrong."

696
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:50,176
LIAM: We're going to double your fucking
business.

697
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:53,500
LAURA: Mm, we're going to bring you so many
scales. You just wait.

698
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,915
MATT: (deadpan) "I've never heard this before."

699
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,279
(laughter)

700
00:47:58,279 --> 00:48:02,452
MATT: "I've never been disappointed by it, either.
In all sincerity..."

701
00:48:02,452 --> 00:48:04,384
SAM: "... leave."

702
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:07,864
(laughter)

703
00:48:07,864 --> 00:48:15,399
MATT: "The gnome speaks because I do not have to.
But good luck, and don't stray too far. Stay safe,

704
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,523
"please? I put a lot of faith in you."

705
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:21,256
SAM: All right, to the potion shop. To the
Quadroads.

706
00:48:21,256 --> 00:48:25,260
LAURA: Wait, oh, wait! One thing. I know
we're going.

707
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,830
LIAM: Mirrors.

708
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,802
MARY: (laughs) No! (clears her throat)

709
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:33,213
SAM: I attempt to read lips.

710
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:36,559
LAURA: Is Lyra around? Anywhere?

711
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,133
MATT: As you say that, you hear a voice in the back of the room
go, "What, is she?!" You see Aldor in the back

712
00:48:41,203 --> 00:48:43,486
table, he's already up with his bag, ready to
run.

713
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:45,357
(laughter)

714
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:49,914
MATT: "Aldor, sit down, it's okay. Ah, not at the
moment, she's currently helping her uncle."

715
00:48:49,914 --> 00:48:52,326
LAURA: At the place where he is.

716
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:53,625
LIAM: In town?

717
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,386
SAM: The place where we got a lot of stuff.

718
00:48:56,386 --> 00:48:57,887
MARY: We got the horses last time.

719
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,526
MATT: "He's the ambassador."

720
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:00,880
LAURA: Cool. Thank you.

721
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,864
WILL: As they're leaving, can Kash pull Zahra
aside really quickly? Are you going with them?

722
00:49:07,864 --> 00:49:09,035
Seriously?

723
00:49:09,035 --> 00:49:11,330
MARY: What do you want to do, do you want to stay
here while the world burns?

724
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:12,279
WILL: Yes.

725
00:49:12,279 --> 00:49:13,136
MARY: Why?

726
00:49:13,136 --> 00:49:15,434
WILL: Because we're here. It's warm, we make
money.

727
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:20,187
MARY: Not if nothing's left to protect. Not if
there are no monsters left. If these things get

728
00:49:20,187 --> 00:49:23,389
out, if they spread their fire across the globe,
what's left for us?

729
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:26,356
WILL: If, if, if. If any of the monsters we miss
went out and spread--

730
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:27,891
the world's always ending, baby!

731
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:31,740
MARY: They just took out Draconia, darling. All of
it. Gone.

732
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,230
WILL: I'll follow you. Anywhere. You know that.

733
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,943
MARY: I know. And I'll follow you.

734
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:39,916
WILL: Tell me what you want to do and I'm there.

735
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:43,590
MARY: For a while.

736
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,641
WILL: Let's go.

737
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:48,728
MARY: If we don't like it, we'll leave. If we find
something better.

738
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:56,015
WILL: We'll leave. Okay. Leave half the gold here.
They don't need to know everything that we have.

739
00:49:56,015 --> 00:49:58,386
MARY: Fuck that.

740
00:49:58,386 --> 00:49:59,584
WILL: All right.

741
00:49:59,584 --> 00:50:01,117
MARY: We might need it.

742
00:50:01,117 --> 00:50:05,437
WILL: Then hide half the gold. I don't trust the
twins as far as I can throw them.

743
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:08,266
LAURA: I can read your fucking lips.

744
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:10,224
WILL: Apparently she reads lips.

745
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:12,027
(laughter)

746
00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:18,429
MARY: Oh yes, I'd forgotten that. All right. She
knows how much we have. We're going for a while.

747
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:20,638
WILL: Was I wrong, by the way? Did you see how hot
Keyleth is?

748
00:50:20,638 --> 00:50:21,973
MARY: She's fucking hot.

749
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:24,328
WILL: That's what I'm saying. Let's go, we should
go.

750
00:50:24,328 --> 00:50:25,812
LIAM: We're so nice!

751
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:27,164
LAURA: We're <i>so</i> nice!

752
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:29,017
LIAM: What the fuck is that about?!

753
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:37,303
MATT: All right, so you guys head out of the
Slayer's Take guildhall into Vasselheim, which is

754
00:50:37,303 --> 00:50:42,803
now a little more bustling than it was when you
arrived. It's about midday. The sun is still not

755
00:50:42,803 --> 00:50:46,016
visible. There's enough cloud cover where you can
see where it would be in the sky, but it's still

756
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:51,931
pretty grey. No rain, and there is still
relatively recent snow that covers most of the

757
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:56,401
city streets, some of which has been pushed to the
sides to make walkways easier. It's been snowing

758
00:50:56,401 --> 00:51:03,825
here in the winter rather often, as you two are
both very aware. You have multiple things you

759
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:06,767
want: the potion shop, there's the Platinum
Sanctuary, I think last time you mentioned the

760
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:07,965
Trial Forge.

761
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:08,777
TRAVIS: Yeah.

762
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:09,914
MATT: What do you guys want to do?

763
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:11,264
LAURA: Potions first.

764
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:13,268
MATT: All right. So you make your way to the
Quadroads.

765
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:17,234
LAURA: Can I pull him aside as we're walking
there?

766
00:51:17,234 --> 00:51:18,293
MATT: Yeah.

767
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:27,455
LAURA: And ask, so, I thought you were interested
in Keyleth. Am I wrong? I mean, you're interested

768
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:32,336
in Keyleth. Right? I mean, I know you don't want
to tell me. I know you don't tell me anything like

769
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:35,230
this, but-- is it weird that he's here?

770
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:40,899
LIAM: No, he's fine. And I am.

771
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:45,842
LAURA: Okay. Should I take him out?

772
00:51:45,842 --> 00:51:47,178
LIAM: No!

773
00:51:47,178 --> 00:51:48,767
LAURA: Because I can.

774
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:49,628
LIAM: No, he's--

775
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:50,833
LAURA: Destroy him.

776
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:56,284
LIAM: He's useful. And I don't hold anything
against him, and she's-- why wouldn't he want her?

777
00:51:56,284 --> 00:51:57,632
Of course he does.

778
00:51:57,632 --> 00:52:01,799
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, Keyleth is <i>so</i>! <i>Fucking!</i>
<i>Beautiful!</i> I get it.

779
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:08,117
LIAM: Well, so are you, but what the fuck am I
going to do with that? Jeez, you're fucking weird.

780
00:52:08,117 --> 00:52:09,817
And I walk off.

781
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,411
(laughter)

782
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:15,427
TALIESIN: Now we're getting somewhere.

783
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:20,101
MATT: Coming back to the center of the Quadroads,
you guys have been here before. This is where the

784
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:27,679
center of the city's trade happens. Imagine the
central Abdar's Promenade of Emon, as it once was,

785
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:39,131
but condensed. And it is just hovels and tents and
all these open shops that are crammed in this

786
00:52:39,131 --> 00:52:42,318
heavy space. It looks like the-- what's it, from
"Hellboy II"--

787
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,566
WILL: Underground mall. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

788
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:48,259
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:54,854
MATT: Wall to wall buildings, but people, not
weird creatures. People shouting, people are-- get

790
00:52:54,854 --> 00:52:57,456
some proper audio for this, one second.

791
00:52:57,456 --> 00:53:00,200
LAURA: Fresh fish!

792
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,564
MARY: Fresh fish!

793
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:08,344
MATT: Exactly. So as you guys are walking around,
you eventually find your way up to the same area

794
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:16,804
where you found the potions from before. You can
see him there, he's wearing an open red vest that

795
00:53:16,804 --> 00:53:23,104
falls to the ground behind him, arms are revealed,
he has these thick bracers on that are really

796
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:30,361
finely scrolled with brass. He's got a fine Van
Dyke beard going on now. He's currently speaking

797
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:39,557
with someone off to the side. "Yes, of course, I'm
more than happy to, yes. You! I remember you. Oh,

798
00:53:39,557 --> 00:53:41,490
"it's been quite some time--"

799
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,719
LAURA: You!

800
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,262
MATT: "Step on over here, sir, I would love having
more--"

801
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,219
LAURA: I push Grog out of the way.

802
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:47,428
TRAVIS: What, hey! What?

803
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:49,067
LAURA: <i>You</i>.

804
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:50,381
MATT: "Yes, can I help you?"

805
00:53:50,381 --> 00:53:52,436
LAURA: You sneaky mother-- Is he the one?

806
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:53,304
TRAVIS: What?

807
00:53:53,304 --> 00:53:55,481
LAURA: Is he the one haggled with you? The one you
traded all of our--?

808
00:53:55,481 --> 00:53:57,134
TRAVIS: I got a really great deal!

809
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:03,251
MATT: "He got a fantastic deal the last time. He's
a grade A customer. I'm sorry, is there a problem?"

810
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:06,949
TRAVIS: Nope, no problem at all, you'll be doing
business with me.

811
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:09,462
(laughter)

812
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:14,011
TRAVIS: Sit back, love, and watch a pro work.

813
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:17,139
MARY: Have we all walked into the store?

814
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:20,404
LAURA: He's a cart-- he's a stupid cart salesman.

815
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:23,249
TALIESIN: We're all going to learn something very
valuable right now.

816
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:29,256
TRAVIS: I don't know if you've noticed, but these
twats below me need healing potions. Mm, whatever.

817
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:31,480
Do you have anything like that on you?

818
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,866
MATT: "Hoo, hoo, hoo, do I? Do not worry, sir.
Hold on just a moment." He disappears into the

819
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:37,428
small tent opening behind him.

820
00:54:37,428 --> 00:54:40,205
LAURA: Keyleth, Hold Person or something to shut
him up!

821
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:42,687
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, it's funny, but we don't have
that much gold.

822
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,084
LAURA: We don't have anything.

823
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:48,391
TRAVIS: (calls out) I've got 6,500 gold to spend
and I mean to spend quite a bit of it.

824
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:55,350
MATT: "Music to my ears!" You hear from inside the
tent, as he comes out with this long, very

825
00:54:55,350 --> 00:55:00,960
well-carved wooden-- looks like a test tube set,
almost. There are all various potions of different

826
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,439
sizes and colors. He sets it down. "So, potions of
healing, you say." He pulls out a few of them.

827
00:55:07,439 --> 00:55:12,891
"This here I have, two superior healing
potions..."

828
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:14,534
SAM: Ooh, nice.

829
00:55:14,534 --> 00:55:21,415
MATT: "Three greater healing potions and ten
regular potions of healing, at your disposal,

830
00:55:21,415 --> 00:55:23,733
"should you require them. Mm, yes."

831
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:35,598
LIAM: Grog, what about this? You are <i>really</i>
strong and really good at killing things and my

832
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:40,512
left-- left? Yeah. Nut still has a dent in it. You
are really fucking strong.

833
00:55:40,512 --> 00:55:41,356
TRAVIS: Yeah.

834
00:55:41,356 --> 00:55:44,040
LIAM: You are the best there is at what you do.

835
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,046
MATT: "And by far a handsome and intelligent
salesman."

836
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:48,142
LIAM: Please shut up.

837
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:54,017
My sister is very good at-- do you know what
math is?

838
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,739
TRAVIS: Mathis?

839
00:55:55,739 --> 00:56:01,680
(laughter)

840
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,611
LIAM: Vex'ahlia is very good at--

841
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:11,547
LAURA: I don't even want to deal with this dick now!

842
00:56:11,547 --> 00:56:16,684
LIAM: She is an excellent shopper. I'm telling
you, you know how you take things' skulls and turn

843
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:18,554
them into like raspberry jam?

844
00:56:18,554 --> 00:56:19,709
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a paste.

845
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:25,733
LIAM: Yeah, that's what she does with money. And
I'm saying, we've had our differences, and I know

846
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:32,140
you're stronger than me and I'm saying as strong
as you are, that's as good as she is with shiny.

847
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,421
MATT: "And yet she was so abrasive when she
arrived."

848
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:35,780
LIAM: I say, shut up!

849
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,216
MATT: "Fine, hmph!"

850
00:56:37,216 --> 00:56:43,923
LAURA: Darling. You're lucky I don't-- Trinket?
Have you seen my pet bear?

851
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:46,561
MATT: Trinket stumbles inside.

852
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:49,989
LAURA: Quite adorable. He loves potion salesmen.

853
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:54,450
TRAVIS: You know, I'm not sure if you're aware of
this, but I'm actually the current reigning

854
00:56:54,450 --> 00:57:02,421
champion of the Crucible. And with that title
comes many things, like people that manage your

855
00:57:02,421 --> 00:57:08,937
shinies. I would like to introduce you to my shiny
manager, Vex.

856
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:11,950
MATT: "This one, really?"

857
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:15,336
WILL: Why was he holding your nut?

858
00:57:15,336 --> 00:57:18,472
LAURA: (laughs) No pressure now--

859
00:57:18,472 --> 00:57:22,016
LIAM: It was a little bit of pressure.

860
00:57:22,016 --> 00:57:24,403
TRAVIS: I didn't really hold it, it was like a
flick.

861
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:25,866
MARY: A flick?

862
00:57:25,866 --> 00:57:30,564
LAURA: Look, I'm willing to trade you some very
powerful magical items for some schmeasley little

863
00:57:30,564 --> 00:57:32,500
potions that heal people.

864
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,230
MATT: "How many would you like? What do you want?"

865
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,422
LAURA: I want them all. How much?

866
00:57:36,422 --> 00:57:37,590
MATT: "All of them?"

867
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,589
LIAM: Bulk.

868
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:42,830
MATT: (chuckles) "Well, then. Let me do my math
here." He looks through it. "All right, um..."

869
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,561
WILL: By the way, as you're adding that up, I'd
like to say you should tread lightly or I'm going

870
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:49,938
to tell Vanessa and you'll have trouble getting
anything from the Take ever again.

871
00:57:49,938 --> 00:57:52,470
MATT: "The Take? Are you with the Take?"

872
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,674
LAURA: Oh! Do you not see these-- These amazing--

873
00:57:55,674 --> 00:57:58,579
MARISHA: That's right, we get union discounts.

874
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:04,459
MATT: "Yes, there is indeed a discount with the
Take (nervous laugh). They've been great

875
00:58:04,459 --> 00:58:06,918
representatives in the past, yes."

876
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:08,644
LAURA: I like you more and more, Kashaw, every
time you speak.

877
00:58:08,644 --> 00:58:09,917
WILL: Most people do. Ask Keyleth.

878
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,242
MARISHA: (nervous laughter) What?

879
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:17,261
MATT: "With friendship discount, let me total this
up a bit here."

880
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:23,532
MARY: I walk outside, and I--

881
00:58:23,532 --> 00:58:27,819
MATT: "That will be 6,500 gold pieces for the
lot."

882
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:28,925
LAURA: I'm sorry, how much?

883
00:58:28,925 --> 00:58:31,257
MATT: "6,500 gold pieces for the lot, with the
discount."

884
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,388
LAURA: Right.

885
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:35,827
SAM: So coincidental. That's exactly what Grog
offered.

886
00:58:35,827 --> 00:58:37,505
TRAVIS: That's what I have!

887
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:42,339
LAURA: How about, instead of that, I trade you--

888
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:44,031
TRAVIS: (loud whisper) 7,000!

889
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:45,475
LAURA: Thank you, Grog.

890
00:58:45,475 --> 00:58:47,078
LIAM: (whispers) Stick to the killing!

891
00:58:47,078 --> 00:58:54,822
LAURA: These magical items. And I pull out the
knickknacks that I took from I don't fucking know

892
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:58,678
where. It's knickknacks. But they're magic.

893
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:00,970
TALIESIN: Is knickknack a candy bar?

894
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:06,373
SAM: Vex, no. You can't, you can't possibly trade
that. It's too valuable. What are you doing?

895
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:09,645
LAURA: Well, I know, but where else are we going
to find a vendor--?

896
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:13,104
SAM: Those are the Knickknacks of Kaa.

897
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:19,257
LAURA: I know, and they're quite valuable. But he
said six thousand, six hundred and (mumbles) and

898
00:59:19,257 --> 00:59:21,254
we know this will cover that.

899
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:27,312
SAM: I can't. Please sir, please don't take
advantage of us by taking these things from us.

900
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:30,217
They're too valuable, please, I beg of you.

901
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:32,860
TALIESIN: What have you pulled out?

902
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,409
SAM: The Knickknacks of Kaa.

903
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:36,880
TALIESIN: The Knickknacks of Kaa?! No, not the
Knickknacks of Kaa!

904
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,253
LAURA: (worried sigh) Now I'm doubting-- No, you
know what, maybe I shouldn't trade these.

905
00:59:40,253 --> 00:59:41,722
LIAM: Put them away, put them away.

906
00:59:41,722 --> 00:59:51,040
MATT: Make a deception check. Make a deception
check. I would say, you know, if you wanted to--

907
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,841
SAM: Am I assisting?

908
00:59:52,841 --> 00:59:54,256
MATT: You can assist on this, yeah.

909
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:55,617
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good!

910
00:59:55,617 --> 00:59:57,050
MARY: I'll take some too, as well.

911
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,237
LAURA: What is the assist?

912
00:59:58,237 --> 00:59:59,536
MATT: That gives you advantage on the roll.

913
00:59:59,536 --> 01:00:00,728
SAM: Oh wait, I don't get to roll?

914
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:01,470
MATT: Huh?

915
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,559
SAM: I don't get to roll anything?

916
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:03,778
MATT: No, it just gives her advantage.

917
01:00:03,778 --> 01:00:04,835
LAURA: 27.

918
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:06,131
SAM: (sighs) Oh, that's good.

919
01:00:06,131 --> 01:00:07,531
TALIESIN: That was a really good roll.

920
01:00:07,531 --> 01:00:08,739
WILL: (laughs) That was good.

921
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:13,825
MATT: He goes, "No, no, no, no. Put them on the
table, please. I would like to have a look. Just

922
01:00:13,825 --> 01:00:14,892
"in casies."

923
01:00:14,892 --> 01:00:20,109
LAURA: I'll put one of them down so you can look.

924
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:25,425
MARISHA: As she places it down, can I do a little
Gust cantrip and do a little poof of air?

925
01:00:25,425 --> 01:00:28,079
MATT: Sure. Make a sleight of hand check.

926
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:28,987
MARISHA: Fuck.

927
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:30,618
LAURA: Aw, man. All the time, Keyleth!

928
01:00:30,618 --> 01:00:35,942
MARISHA: I know. Oh, that's good though, that's
good. I'm good, I'm good. Hang on, let me make

929
01:00:35,942 --> 01:00:37,830
sure, make a sleight of hand--18.

930
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:42,595
MATT: 18? Okay. As you sit down (poof), this
little like-- all the dust on the front, a little

931
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:44,641
of the dampness is (poof).

932
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,859
LAURA: I take my hand away, trembling, like I
don't want to give it up.

933
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:57,921
MATT: "Hmm." He pulls out a little glass eyepiece,
inspects. "The craftsmanship is decent."

934
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:07,311
MARY: And as he's doing this, I cast Thaumaturgy
and cause the table to start vibrating.

935
01:01:07,311 --> 01:01:14,628
MATT: What are the components on that?

936
01:01:14,628 --> 01:01:17,857
MARY: It says I can cause minor tremors.

937
01:01:17,857 --> 01:01:20,059
MATT: On the spell. What does it say under
components?

938
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:21,373
LAURA: Oh.

939
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:23,877
LIAM: Knickknacks.

940
01:01:23,877 --> 01:01:26,699
LAURA: Knickknacks is probably the components.

941
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:29,929
WILL: Components is "V."

942
01:01:29,929 --> 01:01:33,441
MATT: Visual. Yeah, you don't have to actually do
anything to it. It just happens.

943
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:35,267
SAM: Why did you even--

944
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:39,128
WILL: Why not, is the question I want to ask.

945
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:45,547
TALIESIN: Really quickly, while the Thaumaturgy is
happening, I'm going to cast Minor Illusion, just

946
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:46,791
go for it.

947
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:48,746
LAURA: What is happening right now?!

948
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,486
MARISHA: We're stacking the deck, man. We're
stacking it.

949
01:01:50,486 --> 01:01:52,578
SAM: Any one of these could fail.

950
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:56,438
MARISHA: If they all succeed, it's going to be
dope.

951
01:01:56,438 --> 01:01:59,566
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a-- the image of a
beautiful woman briefly appear in the reflection

952
01:01:59,566 --> 01:02:03,742
of the object and then vanish. Just a gleam.

953
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:05,356
MARISHA: That's hot. That's hot.

954
01:02:05,356 --> 01:02:06,431
TALIESIN: Thank you.

955
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,297
MATT: You need to make a sleight of hand check.

956
01:02:09,297 --> 01:02:10,966
TALIESIN: I need to make a sleight of hand check?

957
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:12,583
LAURA: Don't you fucking fail at this.

958
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,224
LIAM: Roll that Snitch!

959
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:16,528
LAURA: Natural 20.

960
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,814
TALIESIN: No, but it is a 19.

961
01:02:18,814 --> 01:02:21,249
LIAM: Yeah, gang.

962
01:02:21,249 --> 01:02:25,253
MATT: Okay. So you set down which one of the
knickknacks now?

963
01:02:25,253 --> 01:02:27,121
LAURA: Just one of them.

964
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:28,403
MATT: Which one?

965
01:02:28,403 --> 01:02:30,529
LAURA: Are you asking me as Matt?

966
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:32,017
MATT: These things that you pulled out of the--

967
01:02:32,017 --> 01:02:34,565
WILL: She puts down knick and holds knack.

968
01:02:34,565 --> 01:02:35,482
MATT: There you go.

969
01:02:35,482 --> 01:02:40,531
LAURA: You literally said I gathered up a bunch
of knickknacks worth 750 gold.

970
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:41,564
MATT: Oh, from that. I'm sorry.

971
01:02:41,564 --> 01:02:44,556
(laughter)

972
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:46,881
MATT: I thought you were talking about the tea set
and the dominoes.

973
01:02:46,881 --> 01:02:49,665
LAURA: No, no, no, literally shitty-ass
knickknacks.

974
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:50,803
MATT: Got you.

975
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:52,560
MARISHA: No, we wouldn't be handing that shit
over.

976
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,409
MATT: I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

977
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:56,045
LIAM: This is like matryoshka nesting dolls.

978
01:02:56,045 --> 01:02:57,852
(laughter)

979
01:02:57,852 --> 01:02:59,152
MARISHA: Faberge eggs.

980
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:09,179
MATT: So what this is, it's like a really, really
intricate inkwell that has been made out of gold

981
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:14,121
and bronze. It's stuff you find in a SkyMall,
essentially.

982
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:16,479
SAM: The Pocket Fisherman!

983
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:21,020
TALIESIN: This is Sting, from Lord of the
Rings.

984
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:25,255
MARY: The One Ring to rule them all.

985
01:03:25,255 --> 01:03:26,957
LIAM: That bass is singing!

986
01:03:26,957 --> 01:03:35,287
MATT: All right, so. As the gust of wind fades,
the table begins to shake, and he glances in

987
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:42,248
across the outside of this inkwell amongst a bunch
of other random knickknacks scattered around it.

988
01:03:42,248 --> 01:03:50,539
He looks at it for a second, this flash in his
eyes. He goes, "Hmm. They seem fair enough. I would

989
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:55,993
"say, include these in the transaction, I would be
willing to drop the cost by about 500 gold pieces?

990
01:03:55,993 --> 01:03:58,052
"An even 6,000."

991
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:02,177
LAURA: Darling. I snatch it away and say, do you
have any idea how much these are worth?

992
01:04:02,177 --> 01:04:05,593
MATT: "I do, actually, I'm quite the appraiser.
It's part of my business."

993
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:09,637
LAURA: I know when somebody's trying to swindle
me, darling.

994
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:14,414
MATT: "Well then, step away. You don't need my
business, obviously. Is this how your 'Shiny

995
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:18,635
"Manager' deals with your shinies? Or would you
wish to deal with this face to face?"

996
01:04:18,635 --> 01:04:23,033
LAURA: Tell you what. Take two thousand off your
asking price and we have a deal.

997
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,362
MATT: "That is ridiculous! No."

998
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,129
WILL: How's your family?

999
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,931
MATT: "What does that mean?"

1000
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:33,080
WILL: Just curious how everybody's doing?
Everybody healthy, happy?

1001
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,454
TRAVIS: Yeah, are they well? In one piece?

1002
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,970
MARY: Have you seen your wife?

1003
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:43,136
MATT: Make an intimidation check. (laughing) With
advantage because she's helping.

1004
01:04:43,136 --> 01:04:45,836
(laughter)

1005
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:47,462
WILL: Is that a 20?

1006
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:52,867
MATT: Roll a d20 twice and take the higher of the
two. Add your intimidation.

1007
01:04:52,867 --> 01:04:54,264
TALIESIN: Roll again.

1008
01:04:54,264 --> 01:04:56,310
WILL: 19.

1009
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,954
TALIESIN: Yay! Wait, wait, no. What's your--?

1010
01:04:57,954 --> 01:04:59,184
WILL: Plus intimi-- 18.

1011
01:04:59,184 --> 01:05:04,302
SAM: Negative one intimidation.

1012
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:06,550
WILL: He's a human cleric, I'm doing my best.

1013
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,555
LIAM: Laughter during a game, what a novelty!

1014
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:15,700
MATT: "Um. They're fine. Uh, quite fine. Yes. A
thousand gold? Off the asking price?"

1015
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,402
LAURA: Two thousand gold off the asking price.

1016
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:19,574
MATT: "That-- that's ridiculous. It's not even--
what are you--"

1017
01:05:19,574 --> 01:05:21,823
WILL: Have you heard him talk about paste?

1018
01:05:21,823 --> 01:05:29,172
MATT: "I-- 1,300 off the asking price.
Nothing more."

1019
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:30,615
LIAM: I take one of my daggers.

1020
01:05:30,615 --> 01:05:31,640
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

1021
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:38,570
LIAM: And looking at him, I stick it in Grog's arm
and I drag it down and I never take my eyes off him.

1022
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:40,361
TRAVIS: Neither do I.

1023
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:42,076
TALIESIN: He has a lip collection.

1024
01:05:42,076 --> 01:05:45,027
MATT: He's looking, like, over you guys now,
towards the thoroughfare.

1025
01:05:45,027 --> 01:05:46,578
LAURA: Looking for guards.

1026
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:49,672
MATT: "Ah, um. Perhaps, uh--"

1027
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:51,339
TRAVIS: Keep your voice down.

1028
01:05:51,339 --> 01:05:52,512
MATT: "I would need..."

1029
01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:54,141
LIAM: There's no magic here, friend.

1030
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:56,216
MATT: "Um."

1031
01:05:56,216 --> 01:05:58,998
LAURA: Fifteen hundred off the asking price.

1032
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:00,141
TALIESIN: Seems fair.

1033
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:01,169
SAM: That seems fair.

1034
01:06:01,169 --> 01:06:02,413
WILL: Completely fair.

1035
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:06,181
MATT: "Five thousand gold, knickknacks and ah,
we're all good? Yes?"

1036
01:06:06,181 --> 01:06:10,016
LAURA: Yes. Five thousand gold.

1037
01:06:10,016 --> 01:06:13,003
MATT: "All right, here you are. Please now, it
would be wondrous after we complete this

1038
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:16,303
"transaction that we never meet again."

1039
01:06:16,303 --> 01:06:18,870
LAURA: Oh dear. I'm afraid I've already Hunter's
Marked you.

1040
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:21,757
MATT: "I don't even know what that means."

1041
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:26,200
(laughter)

1042
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,171
MATT: There's a person waiting behind you. "Um,
excuse me--"

1043
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:30,351
"We're closed!"

1044
01:06:30,351 --> 01:06:33,698
(laughter)

1045
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:38,174
LAURA: Oh, right, of course, let me count up this
little amount right here.

1046
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:40,038
SAM: Kash, Zahra, you should probably contribute.

1047
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:44,344
LAURA: No, that's all right, dear. Five thousand
gold.

1048
01:06:44,344 --> 01:06:45,896
MATT: "Thank you."

1049
01:06:45,896 --> 01:06:50,672
LAURA: Oh, and here, these very valuable--

1050
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:57,611
MATT: "Good day! Good day."

1051
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:59,543
WILL: It's been a pleasure.

1052
01:06:59,543 --> 01:07:02,889
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little tulip and give it
to her.

1053
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:04,170
MATT: To him?

1054
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,142
MARISHA: Him.

1055
01:07:05,142 --> 01:07:06,710
WILL: Her now.

1056
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,929
MARY: Her now. Kash does have an effect, doesn't
he?

1057
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:11,272
MARISHA: Debateable.

1058
01:07:11,272 --> 01:07:12,716
MATT: He takes it, confused, and goes--

1059
01:07:12,716 --> 01:07:16,648
LAURA: Wait, what potions did we just take?

1060
01:07:16,648 --> 01:07:21,351
MATT: You grab the potions that are on the table
that he pushed towards you. There is one superior

1061
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:22,309
healing--

1062
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:23,701
LAURA: You said there was two superior.

1063
01:07:23,701 --> 01:07:25,277
TRAVIS: One superior, two greater, and ten--

1064
01:07:25,277 --> 01:07:28,417
MATT: Yes. One superior, two greater, ten
regular.

1065
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:30,037
LAURA: That's a good amount.

1066
01:07:30,037 --> 01:07:32,708
MARISHA: That's pretty good. I didn't realize
there was ten in there.

1067
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:36,511
LAURA: Yeah, it's a lot. Okay, cool.

1068
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,346
TALIESIN: And we only had to threaten a shopkeeper
with bodily harm to get it.

1069
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,235
WILL: I was gonna say, it was the first time I've
ever intimidated anybody in my life. It was fun.

1070
01:07:42,235 --> 01:07:43,508
(laughter)

1071
01:07:43,508 --> 01:07:45,183
WILL: That was fun, I have to admit.

1072
01:07:45,183 --> 01:07:48,763
LAURA: You guys-- I'm sorry, but we make a pretty
good team.

1073
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,235
WILL: That wasn't bad. I could get used to that.

1074
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:56,022
TRAVIS: Not that it's like, not for nothing, will
you take this fucking dagger out of my arm?

1075
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:58,024
MARISHA: Does this mean we're a terrible
influence?

1076
01:07:58,024 --> 01:08:00,923
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on Grog.

1077
01:08:00,923 --> 01:08:03,676
TALIESIN: It means you're a good influence or
we're a terrible influence on you.

1078
01:08:03,676 --> 01:08:07,001
MATT: It would only have been like two points of
damage to you, so that would have healed up fine.

1079
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:12,418
SAM: Vex.

1080
01:08:12,418 --> 01:08:13,660
LAURA: Yeah?

1081
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,347
SAM: He said two superior.

1082
01:08:15,347 --> 01:08:19,186
LAURA: He <i>did</i> say two superior. I knew he said
two superior! Matt!

1083
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:21,181
MARISHA: Oh, look at that, look at that, look at
that!

1084
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:22,627
LAURA: I chase after him.

1085
01:08:22,627 --> 01:08:23,717
SAM: I'm coming too.

1086
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:24,951
(laughter)

1087
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:26,982
TALIESIN: No! No! No?

1088
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:30,172
MATT: So you come into the tent after him?

1089
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,211
LAURA: Yeah.

1090
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:33,877
LIAM: No, no, it's brilliant. Let it play. Let it
play.

1091
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:39,327
LAURA: Actually, dear. Dear? I believe you left
one of your potions off the table.

1092
01:08:39,327 --> 01:08:45,207
MATT: He turns around. "The superior potions are
five thousand gold apiece, baseline."

1093
01:08:45,207 --> 01:08:54,226
LAURA: But you said you had two superior and you
said all the potions for the amount we said.

1094
01:08:54,226 --> 01:08:56,304
MATT: "I said all the ones I placed on the table
before you."

1095
01:08:56,304 --> 01:09:02,575
LIAM: Ah, there's so much blood on this fucking
dagger. Ugh.

1096
01:09:02,575 --> 01:09:04,467
LAURA: Are you going back on your word?

1097
01:09:04,467 --> 01:09:08,888
MATT: "You've made a grand deal with what we said.
If you continue to push this, I'm afraid I'm going

1098
01:09:08,888 --> 01:09:10,994
"to have to get the guards."

1099
01:09:10,994 --> 01:09:16,297
LAURA: Eh. Superior's a superior.

1100
01:09:16,297 --> 01:09:20,985
WILL: My guess is he couldn't get to the front of
the tent by the time we got to him. But that's up

1101
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:23,490
to you. We're just guests here.

1102
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:29,205
LAURA: No, it's all right. I know they're
expensive. And we've already taken enough

1103
01:09:29,205 --> 01:09:30,259
advantage.

1104
01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:32,157
TRAVIS: Yeah, if they're what they say they are.

1105
01:09:32,157 --> 01:09:33,568
LAURA: No!

1106
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:35,398
TRAVIS: That's what I'd do.

1107
01:09:35,398 --> 01:09:36,762
LIAM: Cross your fingers.

1108
01:09:36,762 --> 01:09:41,860
LAURA: Can I sniff and make sure it's actually a
real potion that he gave us? Did he give us

1109
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,230
fucking fake potions?

1110
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:48,686
MATT: You can go back and take a moment and sniff,
yeah. Go ahead and make a perception check.

1111
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:50,536
LAURA: Is it like watered-down gasoline?

1112
01:09:50,536 --> 01:09:52,386
MATT: Make a perception check.

1113
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:58,705
LAURA: 23.

1114
01:09:58,705 --> 01:10:04,614
MATT: You take it and uncork and sniff. Yeah, it's
a very familiar pungent herbal smell of--

1115
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:06,189
WILL: Watered-down gasoline.

1116
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:07,068
MATT: Yeah.

1117
01:10:07,068 --> 01:10:08,516
(laughter)

1118
01:10:08,516 --> 01:10:09,968
LAURA: Fine. Okay.

1119
01:10:09,968 --> 01:10:16,462
TALIESIN: You did very well and there are other
things that we should think about purchasing.

1120
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,560
LAURA: You're right, you're right, you're right.

1121
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,951
SAM: That lady was the worst.

1122
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:20,170
(laughter)

1123
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:22,718
TRAVIS: That lady's the worst.

1124
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:26,061
MARY: Do you need to get gunpowder?

1125
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:30,311
TALIESIN: I could use a bit of a top-up just
because who knows when the next time we're going

1126
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:31,783
to be in this direction.

1127
01:10:31,783 --> 01:10:33,087
SAM: To a pub?

1128
01:10:33,087 --> 01:10:35,432
MARY: No, let's go to the gunpowder. Let's get you
some.

1129
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:42,961
TALIESIN: And perhaps, considering that we're
going to be very mobile, a map would not be the

1130
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:44,465
worst purchase.

1131
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:49,195
LAURA: I thought we have a good map of the world.

1132
01:10:49,195 --> 01:10:55,262
MATT: You have a fair map of Tal'Dorei and you
have what is a basic layout of the continents.

1133
01:10:55,262 --> 01:10:57,885
TALIESIN: Don't we have a mapmaker?

1134
01:10:57,885 --> 01:11:00,592
MARISHA: We do have a mapmaker. Wasn't he here? Or
was he in Emon?

1135
01:11:00,592 --> 01:11:02,051
MATT: You met Tyriok here.

1136
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:03,477
MARISHA: Tyriok, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1137
01:11:03,477 --> 01:11:09,406
MATT: Though you haven't seen him. He mentioned to
you previously he's currently traveling to finish his--

1138
01:11:09,406 --> 01:11:12,119
MARISHA: Yeah, that's right. We caught him in the
tavern, correct?

1139
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:13,120
MATT: Yes.

1140
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,521
MARY: Don't you think the Slayer's Take-- should I
run back and talk to Vanessa?

1141
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,568
WILL: Vanessa has to have maps somewhere.

1142
01:11:17,568 --> 01:11:21,836
MARY: She's got to have one somewhere. You need a
basic map of Vasselheim, is that what you're

1143
01:11:21,836 --> 01:11:22,739
speaking of?

1144
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:24,864
TALIESIN: It would not be a terrible thing to
have, considering we're going to be traveling.

1145
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,695
MARISHA: Of Vasselheim? Or of--?

1146
01:11:26,695 --> 01:11:28,352
SAM: The world.

1147
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:38,524
MATT: Othanzia is the larger country set around.
The continent is Issylra. Issylra is a very large

1148
01:11:38,524 --> 01:11:46,055
continent. It's almost the equivalent of Asia and
Russia, like that whole-- it's very wide and a lot

1149
01:11:46,055 --> 01:11:49,033
of it is wild and untamed land and wilderness.

1150
01:11:49,033 --> 01:11:51,971
TALIESIN: Let me top up a bit on what I need.

1151
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:53,429
LAURA: All right.

1152
01:11:53,429 --> 01:11:56,738
TALIESIN: I'll need you as well because you hold
the purse strings.

1153
01:11:56,738 --> 01:11:58,018
LIAM: Who's got the potions?

1154
01:11:58,018 --> 01:11:59,362
MATT: Hmm?

1155
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:00,380
LIAM: Who's got the potions?

1156
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,275
LAURA: I have the potions.

1157
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:02,512
SAM: Can I divvy those out, please?

1158
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:05,298
LIAM: Ah, I'm so fast, but I'm really weak. Can I
have another one?

1159
01:12:05,298 --> 01:12:07,159
LAURA: I already gave you a greater.

1160
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:10,581
LIAM: I know you did. But I get fucked up really
easily. Could I have another one?

1161
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:13,388
LAURA: I give-- wait, how many people are there?
Eight of us.

1162
01:12:13,388 --> 01:12:14,391
LIAM: Yeah.

1163
01:12:14,391 --> 01:12:15,895
MARISHA: So there was a few regulars, yeah?

1164
01:12:15,895 --> 01:12:17,154
LIAM: Just another, one more.

1165
01:12:17,154 --> 01:12:19,444
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll give you two
normies.

1166
01:12:19,444 --> 01:12:21,398
LIAM: Thank you.

1167
01:12:21,398 --> 01:12:23,858
LAURA: And everybody else gets a normie as well.

1168
01:12:23,858 --> 01:12:24,857
TALIESIN: I'll take a normie.

1169
01:12:24,857 --> 01:12:26,034
WILL: Thank you.

1170
01:12:26,034 --> 01:12:30,707
SAM: Who gets the supe? And the great?

1171
01:12:30,707 --> 01:12:32,413
LAURA: Who's our weakest?

1172
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:34,666
SAM: (clears throat)

1173
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:39,963
LAURA: Yeah, you're pretty weak. Take a greater,
Scanlan.

1174
01:12:39,963 --> 01:12:41,114
SAM: Yes!

1175
01:12:41,114 --> 01:12:42,845
TALIESIN: The two poor decision makers, I
imagine.

1176
01:12:42,845 --> 01:12:47,187
LIAM: What's that, Smoke Man?

1177
01:12:47,187 --> 01:13:01,710
LAURA: Grog, do you want the other greater? Yeah,
take the other greater. And then I have one

1178
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,997
superior. How many hit points does a superior
heal?

1179
01:13:04,997 --> 01:13:09,821
MATT: A superior heals 8d4 plus eight.

1180
01:13:09,821 --> 01:13:10,924
LIAM: That's low.

1181
01:13:10,924 --> 01:13:12,828
LAURA: That's not that many. It's 5,000 gold?

1182
01:13:12,828 --> 01:13:17,152
MARISHA: Yeah, no. No, healing potions are
generally a rip off.

1183
01:13:17,152 --> 01:13:18,501
LAURA: What a waste.

1184
01:13:18,501 --> 01:13:19,454
MARISHA: I know.

1185
01:13:19,454 --> 01:13:23,962
MATT: Oh my god! I just buy healing to save my
life! Such a waste!

1186
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:26,115
(laughter)

1187
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:29,069
MATT: Oh my god, there's like a whole trade of
really talented magical practitioners that spend

1188
01:13:29,069 --> 01:13:32,410
their time crafting and brewing up these potions
in the hopes they can save your life in the future.

1189
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:34,849
LIAM: What's this character called? What's this
character called?

1190
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:39,007
MARISHA: It's true, I did buy a book to learn
alchemy, and I just haven't had time to do it.

1191
01:13:39,007 --> 01:13:40,355
MARY: It's a great read, trust me.

1192
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:42,161
MARISHA: The alchemy book? Yes?

1193
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:44,875
TRAVIS: Are we fucking buying anything else or
what are we doing now?

1194
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:46,102
LAURA: Black powder.

1195
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:47,966
LIAM: He needs the Bang Bang Man.

1196
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:51,750
TALIESIN: Let's go get some powder. Let's get some
black powder and whatever else we might--

1197
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,051
MARY: Boomstick needs the bang.

1198
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:55,945
SAM: While they're buying powder, I'm going to go
get a fucking drink somewhere.

1199
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:56,954
TRAVIS: Ooh! Yeah!

1200
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:58,146
TALIESIN: We'll meet you at the pub.

1201
01:13:58,146 --> 01:13:59,487
MARISHA: I'll go with Scanlan and Grog.

1202
01:13:59,487 --> 01:14:01,211
WILL: I'm going to go to the pub as well.

1203
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:09,900
LAURA: I'm going with Percy. Go get a drink.

1204
01:14:09,974 --> 01:14:12,679
WILL: Okay, I'm going to go to the pub.

1205
01:14:12,809 --> 01:14:15,535
TRAVIS: Yeah, you are, you bad, intimidating
motherfucker!

1206
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,595
SAM: The Abundant Terrace area.

1207
01:14:17,595 --> 01:14:19,326
MATT: Yep.

1208
01:14:19,326 --> 01:14:23,326
MARISHA: Okay. Are you coming to the pub?

1209
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:26,709
LIAM: No, I'm going to help-- no, I'll see you in
a bit.

1210
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:28,747
WILL: I'll take care of her. We'll be fine. Don't
worry about it.

1211
01:14:28,747 --> 01:14:30,355
SAM: Dagon is the owner.

1212
01:14:30,355 --> 01:14:34,137
MATT: Correct, yes. The two taverns you've been to
is that of the Bellows' Respite Inn, which is in

1213
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,684
the Braving Grounds. So yeah, you can go to either
one of those.

1214
01:14:37,684 --> 01:14:40,500
SAM: Oh. Grog, would you rather go to the one near
the Braving Grounds?

1215
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,973
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

1216
01:14:41,973 --> 01:14:43,404
SAM: Or this one?

1217
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:44,597
MATT: Up to you.

1218
01:14:44,597 --> 01:14:47,068
LAURA: Don't start any fights, we have a dragon to
kill.

1219
01:14:47,068 --> 01:14:48,613
TRAVIS: Come on, shot-caller, pick one.

1220
01:14:48,613 --> 01:14:50,525
SAM: Yeah, whatever's closer.

1221
01:14:50,525 --> 01:14:55,961
MATT: Closer would be the Bellows' Respite, that's
also where the Crucible was, the one that was on

1222
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:57,048
the outside of it.

1223
01:14:57,048 --> 01:14:58,002
SAM: Let's go.

1224
01:14:58,002 --> 01:14:59,011
WILL: Better ale.

1225
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:00,753
MARISHA: Old stomping grounds, Grog.

1226
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:03,993
MATT: So you guys go get drinks. Who's going--?

1227
01:15:03,993 --> 01:15:08,761
TALIESIN: Vex and I are going and-- are you coming
as well?

1228
01:15:08,761 --> 01:15:12,819
MARY: How far are we from the Slayer's Take,
and is there any other place in town that I

1229
01:15:12,819 --> 01:15:17,647
personally would know of from being here about
three months, to find a map?

1230
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:23,979
MATT: You can go back and ask the Slayer's Take.
They have basic maps of the nearby countryside. A

1231
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:31,016
lot of the contracts require you to travel across
this side of Othanzia. You go back and you talk to

1232
01:15:31,016 --> 01:15:34,157
Vanessa and you procure one of the maps there that
are usually supplied for one of your missions.

1233
01:15:34,157 --> 01:15:36,153
MARY: All right, and then I'm going to the bar to get a
fucking drink.

1234
01:15:36,153 --> 01:15:37,827
TRAVIS: Yes!

1235
01:15:37,827 --> 01:15:42,078
MATT: All right, so most of them are drinking. Vex
and Percival head-- you guys are all heading

1236
01:15:42,078 --> 01:15:46,282
actually in the same area, to the Braving Grounds
outside the Trial Forge, since that's where the

1237
01:15:46,282 --> 01:15:51,351
bar is and that's also where Victor's little
powder-covered hovel is.

1238
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:54,638
LIAM: Bring him out. Bring him out!

1239
01:15:54,638 --> 01:16:02,336
MATT: So (laughs) as you approach the same area,
you can see that the building is the same as it

1240
01:16:02,336 --> 01:16:05,014
was before, other than it's missing half a roof.

1241
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:08,836
TALIESIN: He might be a bit low on powder.

1242
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:12,984
MATT: It appears to be haphazardly covered with a
series of boards that were nailed to keep things

1243
01:16:12,984 --> 01:16:18,931
closed, but there is definitely, with the snow and
the rain, it's probably not the best place to be

1244
01:16:18,931 --> 01:16:20,473
staying or living.

1245
01:16:20,473 --> 01:16:25,432
TALIESIN: I'm going to remove my coat. As I've
learned.

1246
01:16:25,432 --> 01:16:27,074
LAURA: Yes?

1247
01:16:27,074 --> 01:16:28,569
TALIESIN: Do we have Trinket with us?

1248
01:16:28,569 --> 01:16:29,684
LAURA: Yes, of course.

1249
01:16:29,684 --> 01:16:32,126
TALIESIN: I'm going to put my coat on Trinket for
a moment, just to keep it clean.

1250
01:16:32,126 --> 01:16:33,934
LAURA: A walking coat rack, that's what Trinket
is.

1251
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:36,947
LIAM: Percy, that's not a good idea.

1252
01:16:36,947 --> 01:16:39,235
MATT: Trinket's trying to get the coat off.

1253
01:16:39,235 --> 01:16:43,533
TALIESIN: Thank you, Trinket (knocking).
Hello?

1254
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:51,407
MATT: Some movement, and you hear the shattering
of glass and you hear a (frustrated noise).

1255
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,601
TALIESIN: Victor, are you in there?

1256
01:16:53,601 --> 01:17:01,288
MATT: "Just a moment!" Suddenly the door, whoosh!,
slams open and before you, you see Victor, half

1257
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:06,730
covered in soot, has a big old thick pair of
glasses on his face, one of which is cracked. You

1258
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:12,409
can see his chin now has this puffed out,
partially burnt and curled bit of a goatee at the

1259
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:18,206
very tip of his chin. He looks up at you with
these giant eyes that are projected and magnified

1260
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:21,600
by his eyewear. "Can I help you?!"

1261
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,747
(laughter)

1262
01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:26,780
TALIESIN: Yes, it's Percival. Do you remember me?

1263
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,927
MATT: "No!"

1264
01:17:27,927 --> 01:17:31,136
(laughter)

1265
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:32,646
TALIESIN: Excellent.

1266
01:17:32,646 --> 01:17:34,932
MATT: "Is that all?!"

1267
01:17:34,932 --> 01:17:39,880
TALIESIN: I was hoping to procure some black
powder again. We had a-- we made a deal last time--

1268
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:42,786
MATT: "Yes, yes, come in, please come in!"

1269
01:17:42,786 --> 01:17:44,458
TALIESIN: Do I have to? Okay.

1270
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:46,294
MATT: He turns around and heads back inside.

1271
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:48,369
LAURA: I'm going to stand out here.

1272
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:50,898
TALIESIN: That's quite wise. Please keep my jacket
clean.

1273
01:17:50,898 --> 01:17:58,311
MATT: As you enter, indeed, a good half of the
roof is missing and you see now a lot of things

1274
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:05,525
have been moved away because currently there is a
pile of burnt and destroyed wood splinters that

1275
01:18:05,525 --> 01:18:10,601
are also soaked through, and there's a little bit
of mold and rotten mildew that has gathered in that

1276
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:13,556
far corner as well, from the weather.

1277
01:18:13,556 --> 01:18:16,477
LIAM: I'm going to stand over here and fail to
stay in character, okay?

1278
01:18:16,477 --> 01:18:19,134
(laughter)

1279
01:18:19,134 --> 01:18:22,810
TALIESIN: You should roll for that. You're looking
well.

1280
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:27,849
MATT: "Heh, heh! Mostly." He turns around and you
can see now, what you failed to notice when you

1281
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:31,264
first started this is where once there was five,
there is now three fingers.

1282
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:36,289
MARISHA: Yes, he has character progression!

1283
01:18:36,289 --> 01:18:38,250
(laughter)

1284
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,313
TALIESIN: That's impressive.

1285
01:18:41,313 --> 01:18:43,293
MATT: "Learn from my mistakes!"

1286
01:18:43,293 --> 01:18:45,370
(laughter)

1287
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:47,219
TALIESIN: You can learn three more times, easily.

1288
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:53,253
MATT: "I can. Three, four-- yes!" He runs off and
starts rummaging through a bunch of stuff.

1289
01:18:53,253 --> 01:18:56,259
TALIESIN: Victor, I was hoping you would have some
black powder for sale.

1290
01:18:56,259 --> 01:19:03,815
MATT: "I'm on it, I'm on it! Hold on!" He whips
around with this metallic cylinder that is very

1291
01:19:03,815 --> 01:19:08,533
well sealed. "See, I learn from my mistakes!"

1292
01:19:08,533 --> 01:19:10,846
TALIESIN: That's very impressive. Oh--

1293
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:22,577
MATT: He walks very carefully, very gingerly placing
it on the table. "Okay. Carefully." He pulls out

1294
01:19:22,577 --> 01:19:27,050
(fwoosh) a small torch. "I have to unseal the
metal."

1295
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:33,071
TALIESIN: Let's not do that! And I make a quick...
I'm going to try and bap the thing down as quickly

1296
01:19:33,071 --> 01:19:34,181
as I can.

1297
01:19:34,181 --> 01:19:36,533
MATT: Okay. You smack it out of his hand.

1298
01:19:36,533 --> 01:19:39,433
TALIESIN: Let's... I trust you implicitly.

1299
01:19:39,433 --> 01:19:43,397
MATT: "Heh heh heh heh. It's coffee."

1300
01:19:43,397 --> 01:19:46,435
(laughter)

1301
01:19:46,435 --> 01:19:48,217
MATT: "Black powder." (cackles)

1302
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:51,100
(laughter)

1303
01:19:51,100 --> 01:20:01,499
TALIESIN: I think you've had enough. I'm going to
smell the coffee. It's really coffee?

1304
01:20:01,499 --> 01:20:02,546
MATT: Yeah.

1305
01:20:02,546 --> 01:20:09,394
"Sorry, trying to host. It's been a while
since I've had a guest. Would you like some?"

1306
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:12,765
TALIESIN: Just one spoonful would be quite--

1307
01:20:12,765 --> 01:20:17,213
MATT: He goes over to a small kettle and begins
straining it through. He's got this little coffee

1308
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:24,748
brew on the side. "So, real black powder. Wait! I
do know you."

1309
01:20:24,748 --> 01:20:25,678
TALIESIN: Yes!

1310
01:20:25,678 --> 01:20:26,809
MATT: "You've purchased before."

1311
01:20:26,809 --> 01:20:27,742
TALIESIN: I have.

1312
01:20:27,742 --> 01:20:29,607
MATT: "Return customer. Not many of those."

1313
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:31,207
TALIESIN: Not many? Have there been others?

1314
01:20:31,207 --> 01:20:38,208
MATT: He pours a couple of cups for you, pulls it
over to you. "Oh, one. Months ago."

1315
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,932
TALIESIN: Really? Who would--?

1316
01:20:39,932 --> 01:20:46,491
MATT: "Nice woman. Young, good outfit, well
dressed, heh."

1317
01:20:46,491 --> 01:20:52,540
TALIESIN: Excellent. She didn't happen to say
where she was going, did she? By any chance?

1318
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:59,221
MATT: "No, no. Weeks, not months. Time--
strange."

1319
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:04,640
TALIESIN: Weeks? Very good to know. Thank you,
that's so helpful. Did you talk about anything

1320
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,744
else with this nice young woman, at all?

1321
01:21:07,744 --> 01:21:09,533
MATT: "No! She paid well!"

1322
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:11,161
TALIESIN: I'm sure she did.

1323
01:21:11,161 --> 01:21:12,441
MATT: "Kept her distance."

1324
01:21:12,441 --> 01:21:14,229
TALIESIN: I'm sure she did as well.

1325
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:16,285
(laughter)

1326
01:21:16,285 --> 01:21:22,701
TALIESIN: That's-- I'm curious, how have your own
experiments been going? Going well?

1327
01:21:22,701 --> 01:21:27,649
(laughter)

1328
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:34,498
TALIESIN: You should get that looked at some
point. Three more, three more.

1329
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:35,937
MATT: "Three."

1330
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:36,903
LAURA: Percival?

1331
01:21:36,903 --> 01:21:39,047
TALIESIN: Yes! So any black powder that you have,
I would be happy to--

1332
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:40,705
MATT: "Yes."

1333
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:42,716
TALIESIN: Help you pay for a new roof, maybe.

1334
01:21:42,716 --> 01:21:44,722
MATT: "Oh, I have to fix that."

1335
01:21:44,722 --> 01:21:46,438
TALIESIN: You do. Money can help.

1336
01:21:46,438 --> 01:21:51,423
MATT: "Explains the cold." He smears black right
across the front of his face.

1337
01:21:51,423 --> 01:21:53,260
TALIESIN: Doesn't it, though?

1338
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:58,903
MATT: It's like gelled in with whatever mucus had
been captured in there as well, streaked across.

1339
01:21:58,903 --> 01:22:02,357
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not a mustache. That's so--
ugh.

1340
01:22:02,357 --> 01:22:07,138
MATT: He comes back and he's now keeping,
previously it was out in the open, he's learned

1341
01:22:07,138 --> 01:22:12,021
his lesson. He has these glass vials, similar to
what they put potions in, but now he's filling

1342
01:22:12,021 --> 01:22:18,685
them with powder. And he brings out about four of
them. "This is as much as I will spare. I already

1343
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:28,095
"sold a lot recently to the lady. I have my own
tinkering to do, but if you wish to buy these?"

1344
01:22:28,095 --> 01:22:29,200
TALIESIN: Yes.

1345
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,495
MATT: "I would be happy to sell."

1346
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:31,542
TALIESIN: That would be lovely.

1347
01:22:31,542 --> 01:22:41,147
MATT: "Okay. Process of distilling, drying,
preparing, 250 gold!"

1348
01:22:41,147 --> 01:22:42,823
TALIESIN: I think that's very fair.

1349
01:22:42,823 --> 01:22:44,211
MATT: "Wondrous! Deal, deal."

1350
01:22:44,211 --> 01:22:46,128
TALIESIN: Vex?

1351
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,536
LAURA: Yes?

1352
01:22:47,536 --> 01:22:49,580
TALIESIN: 250 gold, if you'd be so kind.

1353
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,468
LAURA: That much?

1354
01:22:50,468 --> 01:22:52,111
TALIESIN: I'm going to make you something lovely.

1355
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:53,126
LAURA: (singsong) I love you!

1356
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:54,776
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

1357
01:22:54,776 --> 01:22:55,938
MATT: "Hiiii!"

1358
01:22:55,938 --> 01:23:00,265
LAURA: H-hi. I give the money to Percy to give to
him.

1359
01:23:00,265 --> 01:23:02,938
TALIESIN: And I hand it out.

1360
01:23:02,938 --> 01:23:09,558
(laughter)

1361
01:23:09,558 --> 01:23:12,117
MATT: "Would you like some coffee?"

1362
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:19,642
TALIESIN: Victor! Thank you, you're so kind. And
if you would be so lovely as to not mention us to

1363
01:23:19,642 --> 01:23:22,816
my friend if she should happen back.

1364
01:23:22,816 --> 01:23:24,233
MATT: "50 gold."

1365
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:25,650
SAM: Oh, shit!

1366
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:34,508
LAURA: Tell you what, Victor. I don't think you
want to tell her anything.

1367
01:23:34,508 --> 01:23:36,581
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1368
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:38,829
LIAM: All you need is a five.

1369
01:23:38,829 --> 01:23:43,096
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. 12.

1370
01:23:43,096 --> 01:23:52,539
MATT: (laughs) Given the circumstance, he has a
really low DC on this, so I'm glad this is the one

1371
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:57,956
you rolled a 12 on. He goes, "For you? I saw
nothing!"

1372
01:23:57,956 --> 01:24:00,111
(laughter)

1373
01:24:00,111 --> 01:24:01,799
TALIESIN: I love you, darling.

1374
01:24:01,799 --> 01:24:05,906
MATT: He catches it and he grabs a glass vial and
puts it in and caps it up.

1375
01:24:05,906 --> 01:24:08,495
LAURA: Okay. Keep it safe, dear.

1376
01:24:08,495 --> 01:24:14,240
TALIESIN: Until we meet again. All of us. Until we
all meet again. Always a pleasure. Ah, keep safe, and--

1377
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,549
MATT: "Yes?"

1378
01:24:15,549 --> 01:24:16,778
TALIESIN: Keep safe.

1379
01:24:16,778 --> 01:24:18,392
MATT: "Will do."

1380
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:19,388
TALIESIN: Yes.

1381
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:26,003
MATT: "Bye!" He waves with his three fingers.
"Close the door when you're done!"

1382
01:24:26,003 --> 01:24:29,173
LIAM: If I may--

1383
01:24:29,173 --> 01:24:34,528
(cheering)

1384
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:39,543
TALIESIN: You're welcome, Internet. You're
welcome.

1385
01:24:39,543 --> 01:24:42,339
LAURA: That was amazing.

1386
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:48,038
LIAM: Oh, man. Hire that fucking fool!

1387
01:24:48,038 --> 01:24:50,449
(laughter)

1388
01:24:50,449 --> 01:24:54,737
MATT: The rest of you find your way back at the
Bellows' Respite Inn where the rest of the party

1389
01:24:54,737 --> 01:24:56,015
has been drinking.

1390
01:24:56,015 --> 01:24:58,229
(cheering)

1391
01:24:58,229 --> 01:24:59,680
MARISHA: How'd it go?

1392
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,798
MARY: (drunkenly) Wait, wait, wait, wait-- okay--
okay.

1393
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:04,107
MATT: Wow, you've been drinking.

1394
01:25:04,107 --> 01:25:06,410
MARY: Grog, Grog.

1395
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:07,540
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1396
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:12,582
MARY: The first time I ever saw you, you were
fighting... the Hammer? Who were you fighting?

1397
01:25:12,582 --> 01:25:14,387
TRAVIS: Yep, yep, Hammer, Hammer.

1398
01:25:14,387 --> 01:25:22,264
MARY: You were fighting the Hammer. So I went away
and I made you... a hammer. And I'm gonna give you

1399
01:25:22,264 --> 01:25:23,439
the hammer.

1400
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:24,860
TRAVIS: You made me a hammer?!

1401
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,095
MARY: I did! That's what I do. I like to forge
things.

1402
01:25:27,095 --> 01:25:28,156
TRAVIS: Really?

1403
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:30,452
MARY: I do. So I made you a hammer.

1404
01:25:30,452 --> 01:25:31,702
LAURA: Does she not drink very much?

1405
01:25:31,702 --> 01:25:33,106
WILL: Not very much at all.

1406
01:25:33,186 --> 01:25:34,343
TRAVIS: That is amazing! I love hammers!

1407
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:39,668
MARY: And I put my crest on it. It's a moon. It's
a full moon.

1408
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:42,788
LIAM: You said she was lush, you didn't say she
was a lush.

1409
01:25:42,788 --> 01:25:44,124
TRAVIS: Is it like a moon hammer?

1410
01:25:44,124 --> 01:25:49,283
MARY: A lovely moon hammer. I want you to have it.
I want you to have it.

1411
01:25:49,283 --> 01:25:51,725
WILL: Z, you gotta slow down.

1412
01:25:51,725 --> 01:25:53,360
MARISHA: No, never!

1413
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,179
TRAVIS: You don't-- you don't have it now?

1414
01:25:55,179 --> 01:25:58,252
MARY: I'll give it to you before we go.

1415
01:25:58,252 --> 01:25:59,355
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

1416
01:25:59,355 --> 01:26:00,960
LAURA: I go and I sit next to Kashaw.

1417
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,098
LIAM: Keek.

1418
01:26:02,098 --> 01:26:04,375
MARISHA: What? Hi.

1419
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:06,040
LIAM: How many of those have you had?

1420
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,808
MARISHA: What?

1421
01:26:07,808 --> 01:26:09,056
LIAM: Less than five?

1422
01:26:09,056 --> 01:26:10,109
WILL: Two or three.

1423
01:26:10,109 --> 01:26:11,368
MARISHA: Three? Two, three?

1424
01:26:11,368 --> 01:26:12,538
WILL: Enough to where it's fun.

1425
01:26:12,538 --> 01:26:19,060
MARISHA: It's blurry. You should join us! You all
have to catch up. Come on! Life has been hard!

1426
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,052
Come on.

1427
01:26:20,052 --> 01:26:21,136
MARY: Come on, Burt!

1428
01:26:21,136 --> 01:26:26,676
MATT: A barkeep comes by, a human gentleman you
recognize from before as Once-Lucky Ned, who had

1429
01:26:26,676 --> 01:26:32,990
originally given you some information. Comes by,
puts the drinks down. "I thought it was you!"

1430
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:34,131
TRAVIS: Yep.

1431
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:38,883
MATT: "Heh, heh. Phillip! Phillip! It's good to
see you."

1432
01:26:38,883 --> 01:26:44,542
TRAVIS: No, no, it was-- it was Philip before, and
now it's Grog.

1433
01:26:44,542 --> 01:26:48,185
MATT: "Oh, he beat the name out of you. That's
harsh."

1434
01:26:48,185 --> 01:26:52,728
TRAVIS: No, no, no. That was the first time, and
then I came back and won my vengeance. Right?

1435
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:53,820
MATT: "Right, right."

1436
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,831
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1437
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:57,398
MATT: "You want to be known as... I see (clicks
tongue). I got you."

1438
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:59,013
TRAVIS: Grog, Grog.

1439
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:05,678
MATT: "Grog the Phillip is in town! Should anyone
wish to take the title of the Crucible, this would

1440
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:07,399
"be the one to talk to. Heh-heh."

1441
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:08,618
MARY: Woo!

1442
01:27:08,618 --> 01:27:12,114
MATT: Faces turn, then go back to business.

1443
01:27:12,114 --> 01:27:14,135
MARISHA: Is Zahra the only one that claps?

1444
01:27:14,135 --> 01:27:16,130
MARY: Woo! Ooh!

1445
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,719
(laughter)

1446
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:25,456
WILL: Oh, Z. Oh, Z.

1447
01:27:25,456 --> 01:27:26,887
MARY: Shut up, Kash.

1448
01:27:26,887 --> 01:27:31,890
MARISHA: I have missed you guys. I've never met
you! But I missed you guys.

1449
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:34,546
MARY: I've missed... you.

1450
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:40,248
TALIESIN: I think we need to catch up a bit. Vax,
Vex, let's all have a toast to the inevitability

1451
01:27:40,248 --> 01:27:42,352
of the universe, please. A cheers.

1452
01:27:42,352 --> 01:27:45,384
LIAM: Which one of us? What was that?

1453
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:48,359
TALIESIN: Vex and Vax. We're having a toast to the
inevitability of the cosmos.

1454
01:27:48,359 --> 01:27:50,636
LAURA: A toast? We're toasting? At a time like
this?

1455
01:27:50,636 --> 01:27:51,515
TALIESIN: We are.

1456
01:27:51,515 --> 01:27:53,894
MARISHA: Look, there's never not a good time to
toast.

1457
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:55,585
WILL: Is there a better time to toast than when
the world is gonna end?

1458
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:56,591
MARISHA: Exactly.

1459
01:27:56,591 --> 01:27:59,485
MARY: We're about to lose everything, we might as
well celebrate what we've got.

1460
01:27:59,485 --> 01:28:06,144
MARISHA: I toast to celebrating the end of the
world with the best friends we could possibly have.

1461
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:10,170
TALIESIN: I'm, I'm, I have something to say to
this.

1462
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:11,342
SAM: Oh, Percy, well.

1463
01:28:11,342 --> 01:28:12,436
TALIESIN: I have something to say.

1464
01:28:12,436 --> 01:28:13,891
MARISHA: All right, Percy, come on.

1465
01:28:13,891 --> 01:28:17,520
TALIESIN: When one is born into gentry, one is
born with an innate sense of destiny.

1466
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,872
(groaning)

1467
01:28:18,872 --> 01:28:20,793
TALIESIN: An innate sense that the world is moving
in a direction--

1468
01:28:20,793 --> 01:28:22,103
SAM: Fuck the dragons!

1469
01:28:22,103 --> 01:28:23,881
(laughter)

1470
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:28,350
TALIESIN: We have been given a direction to move
to actually defeat our foes. We have been given a

1471
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:32,944
sign, we have been given something to move for.
There is an inevitability to the

1472
01:28:32,944 --> 01:28:34,254
goodness of the universe--

1473
01:28:34,254 --> 01:28:35,878
TRAVIS: (slurred) Inevitability.

1474
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:38,281
MARISHA: There is something to fight for, damn
it!

1475
01:28:38,281 --> 01:28:40,425
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Fuck the dragons!

1476
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:43,222
MARY: Here's to fighting for something more than
just money.

1477
01:28:43,222 --> 01:28:44,708
TRAVIS: (slurred) Inevitability.

1478
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:49,455
LIAM: I would rather be with you all than the
finest people in the world.

1479
01:28:49,455 --> 01:28:53,351
MARISHA: Cheers to that, because God knows we're
not the finest.

1480
01:28:53,351 --> 01:28:55,619
MARY: When you find them, let us know.

1481
01:28:55,619 --> 01:29:02,155
WILL: I agree with you about the inevitability of
the universe. The inevitability is that it's always shit.

1482
01:29:02,155 --> 01:29:07,157
TALIESIN: There's stones that are thrown into the
river. There are stones that are thrown upon the

1483
01:29:07,157 --> 01:29:08,847
river, but the river always moves.

1484
01:29:08,847 --> 01:29:11,909
WILL: It's true, but you're not talking about the
fish that's killed by the stones that's thrown

1485
01:29:11,909 --> 01:29:13,271
into the river.

1486
01:29:13,271 --> 01:29:14,973
TRAVIS: Can I go and find the barkeep?

1487
01:29:14,973 --> 01:29:16,238
MATT: Yeah, Once-Lucky Ned is there.

1488
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:21,534
TRAVIS: Remember, right? It's just Grog. It's not
like "Grog the Phillip." It's just Grog.

1489
01:29:21,534 --> 01:29:23,940
MATT: "Oh, I apologize."

1490
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:31,753
TRAVIS: No, it's all right, it's okay. So, does
Earthbreaker Groon, does he ever come in here? Big

1491
01:29:31,753 --> 01:29:34,498
guy, muscley, long, like, stringy--

1492
01:29:34,498 --> 01:29:38,468
MATT: "I know of him. He doesn't come in and
drink, no. He spends most of his days over there

1493
01:29:38,468 --> 01:29:40,436
in that big Trial Forge Temple of Kord."

1494
01:29:40,436 --> 01:29:41,898
TRAVIS: He never comes out?

1495
01:29:41,898 --> 01:29:49,948
MATT: "He'll go into the city on occasion. But
he's one of them, how do I put it? 'Medititive' types."

1496
01:29:49,948 --> 01:29:51,106
TRAVIS: "Medititive"?

1497
01:29:51,106 --> 01:29:58,466
MATT: "Yes. Spends a lot of time thinking.
Sleeping while standing up. It's weird."

1498
01:29:58,466 --> 01:30:00,512
TRAVIS: What? I don't understand. How do you do
that?

1499
01:30:00,512 --> 01:30:01,745
MATT: "You'll have to ask him."

1500
01:30:01,745 --> 01:30:04,072
TRAVIS: "Medititive."

1501
01:30:04,072 --> 01:30:05,112
MATT: "Yes."

1502
01:30:05,112 --> 01:30:06,384
LIAM: Meeting of the minds.

1503
01:30:06,384 --> 01:30:12,506
TRAVIS: All right. Is he like--? All right. Thank
you.

1504
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:16,939
MATT: "No worries. I mean, if I recall, he
actually came and saw your last bout."

1505
01:30:16,939 --> 01:30:21,679
TRAVIS: Yeah, he did! And I want to like go see
him, but I don't know anything about

1506
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,665
"medititiveness," like sleeping standing up.

1507
01:30:23,665 --> 01:30:26,972
MATT: "Go over there to the Trial Forge! He's seen
you once, maybe he'll say hello again."

1508
01:30:26,972 --> 01:30:29,750
TRAVIS: What should I, like, bring him a gift?

1509
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:34,502
MATT: "I don't know. I don't ever talk to him."

1510
01:30:34,502 --> 01:30:41,467
TRAVIS: Is anybody here, like, in the room right
now behind me? Are they present at the Trial Forge

1511
01:30:41,467 --> 01:30:46,510
very often? Hey, don't be so obvious.

1512
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:50,815
(laughter)

1513
01:30:50,815 --> 01:30:53,026
MATT: "No clue."

1514
01:30:53,026 --> 01:30:57,967
TRAVIS: All right. And I flip him a silver. Bing.

1515
01:30:57,967 --> 01:31:00,631
LIAM: That's like half a penny.

1516
01:31:00,631 --> 01:31:02,400
(laughter)

1517
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,204
TRAVIS: We're just talking (laughs). All right.

1518
01:31:05,204 --> 01:31:10,484
SAM: (sighs) What is it, like, noon right now?

1519
01:31:10,484 --> 01:31:12,011
(laughter)

1520
01:31:12,011 --> 01:31:13,665
TALIESIN: (singing) Day-drinking!

1521
01:31:13,665 --> 01:31:18,386
MATT: Well, no, it's probably about 1:30, 2
o'clock in the afternoon.

1522
01:31:18,386 --> 01:31:21,703
MARY: (slurring) Kash and I just got back from
frikkin' and it's time to drinkin'!

1523
01:31:21,703 --> 01:31:23,117
WILL: We haven't even eaten yet.

1524
01:31:23,117 --> 01:31:27,314
MARISHA: Well, (laughs) I lost a fourth of my
civilization!

1525
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:29,579
WILL: That is funny.

1526
01:31:29,579 --> 01:31:31,859
TRAVIS: Wow. That went dark.

1527
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:36,361
LIAM: I raise the bottom of Keyleth's glass and
keep it going.

1528
01:31:36,361 --> 01:31:38,188
(laughter)

1529
01:31:38,188 --> 01:31:44,212
SAM: Should we find Kima next, or should we spend
the day here?

1530
01:31:44,212 --> 01:31:46,621
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, we still have work to
do.

1531
01:31:46,621 --> 01:31:48,862
LAURA: Well, we do have some very inebriated--

1532
01:31:48,862 --> 01:31:51,903
LIAM: Yeah, I think we've accidentally gotten
shit-faced.

1533
01:31:51,903 --> 01:31:53,540
MARY: I can just walk and not do anything.

1534
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,415
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, she can manage.

1535
01:31:55,415 --> 01:32:00,116
MARISHA: Maybe if we hang here long enough Kima
will show up.

1536
01:32:00,116 --> 01:32:02,546
LIAM: No. We're drunk. Here's what we should do.

1537
01:32:02,546 --> 01:32:03,736
LAURA: I'm not drunk.

1538
01:32:03,736 --> 01:32:04,682
LIAM: You ready?

1539
01:32:04,682 --> 01:32:05,726
SAM: I'm not drunk.

1540
01:32:05,726 --> 01:32:06,735
TALIESIN: I'm not either.

1541
01:32:06,735 --> 01:32:10,453
LIAM: We should go watch Grog fight.

1542
01:32:10,453 --> 01:32:17,536
LAURA: What? There are dragons in the world, right
now! And we're fighting? We're going to watch a fight?

1543
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:23,679
LIAM: We need-- listen to me. We need Kima with
us, but Kima doesn't have time for fucking

1544
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:32,454
drunkards. You might not be, but some of us are a
little drunk. So, while that's going on, we wait a

1545
01:32:32,454 --> 01:32:39,516
day, right? And while that day is going on, we
watch Grog pummel some person's face in.

1546
01:32:39,516 --> 01:32:44,655
MARISHA: Plus, when I was a little girl, we used
to be taught that if you were ever lost in the

1547
01:32:44,655 --> 01:32:48,265
forest, to stay and hug a tree.

1548
01:32:48,265 --> 01:32:49,631
LAURA: Don't hug him, Keyleth.

1549
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:51,310
MARISHA: And someone will come and find you.

1550
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:52,765
WILL: I like this plan.

1551
01:32:52,765 --> 01:33:01,808
MARISHA: So if we stay in one place and this ale
is like our tree, okay? We hug the ale and Kima

1552
01:33:01,808 --> 01:33:04,115
will show up. That's my theory.

1553
01:33:04,115 --> 01:33:08,777
MATT: While this is happening, Vex, you glance
over her shoulder to the entryway to this bar, and

1554
01:33:08,777 --> 01:33:13,505
you see stepping in, a familiar, burly looking
half-orc gentleman.

1555
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:16,747
MARISHA: Damn it, I was hoping it was Kima!

1556
01:33:16,747 --> 01:33:18,265
TALIESIN: That would have been hilarious.

1557
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:25,939
MATT: He walks in, wiping his hands from dirt in
the mines, stops, looks over at your table. Slowly

1558
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:28,775
backs out of the tavern and steps back out into
the thoroughfare.

1559
01:33:28,775 --> 01:33:32,411
LIAM: Hey, look at that guy who went out the door!
He looked like that guy you fought in that ring.

1560
01:33:32,411 --> 01:33:33,500
TRAVIS: Really?

1561
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:36,525
LIAM: That guy, yeah. Go get (stammering) do it
again.

1562
01:33:36,525 --> 01:33:40,601
TRAVIS: Hold on a second. And I run out the door.
I run after him, out the door.

1563
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:43,089
MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.

1564
01:33:43,089 --> 01:33:44,634
LIAM: Oh, come on, Grog.

1565
01:33:44,634 --> 01:33:49,000
TRAVIS: 18.

1566
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,042
MATT: 18. You step out in the front of the tavern,
and immediately to the left, you see him ducking

1567
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:56,598
into the alleyway.

1568
01:33:56,598 --> 01:34:00,406
TRAVIS: Wait! Kern! Kern! And I take off running
after him.

1569
01:34:00,406 --> 01:34:04,532
MATT: Okay. You turn around the corner and you see
his back is against the wall and he has sweat

1570
01:34:04,532 --> 01:34:11,198
dripping down his brow. "Hi."

1571
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:18,664
TRAVIS: Hey. Funny seeing you here.

1572
01:34:18,664 --> 01:34:21,010
LAURA: I run up behind Grog.

1573
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:22,632
MARISHA: Why are they acting like they fucked?

1574
01:34:22,632 --> 01:34:24,821
TRAVIS: Things been good?

1575
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:27,214
MATT: At this point--

1576
01:34:27,214 --> 01:34:30,474
WILL: Did you guys date?

1577
01:34:30,474 --> 01:34:32,504
MARISHA: They're ex-lovers!

1578
01:34:32,504 --> 01:34:36,707
MATT: He looks down. "Still a little sore."

1579
01:34:36,707 --> 01:34:38,422
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah.

1580
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:39,632
MATT: "How about you?"

1581
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,789
TRAVIS: When I chew, my jaw goes to one side. It's
fucking weird.

1582
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:43,760
MATT: "Yeah."

1583
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,070
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1584
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:48,055
LAURA: Are you guys all right, then? Everything's
fine?

1585
01:34:48,055 --> 01:34:49,618
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1586
01:34:49,618 --> 01:34:52,065
LAURA: All right, I'm going to go, grab a drink.

1587
01:34:52,065 --> 01:34:58,018
TRAVIS: So, I meant to ask you, that big, muscly,
like long stringy white-haired guy that was

1588
01:34:58,018 --> 01:34:59,522
watching our last fight.

1589
01:34:59,522 --> 01:35:01,341
MATT: "Yeah, yeah. The Earthbreaker."

1590
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:03,708
TRAVIS: Yeah. Who is he to you?

1591
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:15,533
MATT: "I've seen him around. Haven't really...
I talked to him once. I'll level with you. Went

1592
01:35:15,533 --> 01:35:19,431
"to him for a little training after our first
fight."

1593
01:35:19,431 --> 01:35:20,779
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1594
01:35:20,779 --> 01:35:26,916
MATT: "Um. Says I'm a little too angry to pursue
his path."

1595
01:35:26,916 --> 01:35:28,213
TRAVIS: Angry?

1596
01:35:28,213 --> 01:35:31,697
MATT: "I got a lot of pent-up rage the way I was
raised."

1597
01:35:31,697 --> 01:35:34,209
(laughter)

1598
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:37,061
TRAVIS: Family issues? Tell me about it.

1599
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:44,490
MATT: "Tell me about it. (chuckles) Well, half my
folks are bloodthirsty, wandering barbarians in

1600
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:45,821
"the Northern Wastes."

1601
01:35:45,821 --> 01:35:47,260
TRAVIS: No way!

1602
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,787
(laughter)

1603
01:35:48,787 --> 01:35:51,646
MATT: "Yeah. What, you think being a half-orc's
great? No! It's bullshit!"

1604
01:35:51,646 --> 01:35:55,236
TRAVIS: I know! You think goliath is any better?
It's the same fucking thing!

1605
01:35:55,236 --> 01:35:57,605
MATT: "At least you're made for this weather! It's
cold out here!"

1606
01:35:57,605 --> 01:35:59,600
TRAVIS: That's true, it is fucking cold out here.

1607
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,661
MATT: "Yeah, it is."

1608
01:36:00,661 --> 01:36:03,490
TRAVIS: I can only imagine. I'm really sorry I
took your lip off, by the way.

1609
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:05,004
MATT: "Sorry I took yours off, too."

1610
01:36:05,004 --> 01:36:06,403
TRAVIS: That's true. Mine healed better.

1611
01:36:06,403 --> 01:36:07,397
MATT: "Yeah."

1612
01:36:07,397 --> 01:36:12,958
TRAVIS: Hey, so. When you trained with him,
because you were doing all that yoga pilates

1613
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:16,101
stuff. Did it help you out?

1614
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:19,810
MATT: "Well, obviously not, really."

1615
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:25,467
TRAVIS: Right. What did he ask in exchange for
the tutorial?

1616
01:36:25,467 --> 01:36:30,450
MATT: "He didn't ask for any pay. He--"

1617
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:33,099
WILL: Oh god, what did he ask for?

1618
01:36:33,099 --> 01:36:35,647
MATT: "He told me I had--"

1619
01:36:35,647 --> 01:36:37,048
SAM: (mutters) Pretty eyes.

1620
01:36:37,048 --> 01:36:38,077
MATT: "--to help someone."

1621
01:36:38,077 --> 01:36:39,668
(laughter)

1622
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:40,688
TRAVIS: Help someone.

1623
01:36:40,688 --> 01:36:46,044
MATT: "He still hasn't given me the proper details
yet and he hasn't called in the debt, but he told

1624
01:36:46,044 --> 01:36:51,708
"me one day, I was to help him test someone, and
he'd train me."

1625
01:36:51,708 --> 01:36:58,340
TRAVIS: In that Trial Forge, are there like, more
of him, like a bunch of big, jacked-out guys in there?

1626
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:02,979
MATT: "Not as big as him, no. But there's plenty
of others that train under him. All sorts of

1627
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:08,271
"warriors. Weapons of all kinds. It's Kord!" He
looks over, and you see in the distance, the giant

1628
01:37:08,271 --> 01:37:12,856
statue of Kord that sits atop the Trial Forge. He
looks over and with a look of reverence, gives a

1629
01:37:12,856 --> 01:37:17,773
nod, and you can see that this man, a glimmer of
faith in his eyes. He himself probably a follower

1630
01:37:17,773 --> 01:37:29,080
of Kord as well. "He's a great man. I'm not the
right temperament, it seems. But that's fine. He's

1631
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,547
"getting along okay."

1632
01:37:30,547 --> 01:37:35,325
TRAVIS: Right. I won't take up too much more of
your time, but if I could ask you one last thing.

1633
01:37:35,325 --> 01:37:42,614
Aside from the Slayer's Take and the Trial Forge,
if you had to find men at arms, men to attack a

1634
01:37:42,614 --> 01:37:48,033
very large foe, possibly quite dangerous, where
would you go?

1635
01:37:48,033 --> 01:37:59,862
MATT: "Probably the Platinum Sanctuary. Between
them and the Trial Forge, that's most of the

1636
01:37:59,862 --> 01:38:04,860
"actual army. Most of it's Trial Forge. It's part
of what the Braving Grounds are about. They train

1637
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,534
"the armies here, it's where they breed warriors."

1638
01:38:07,534 --> 01:38:08,901
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1639
01:38:08,901 --> 01:38:16,897
MATT: "Most of the Bastions that look over the
city are trained here, so it's-- those are my best

1640
01:38:16,897 --> 01:38:19,672
"bets, at least. Not much of a political man."

1641
01:38:19,672 --> 01:38:24,052
TRAVIS: Well, it's been good seeing you. No one
hit quite as hard as you did.

1642
01:38:24,052 --> 01:38:38,761
MATT: "You too. Um. The medal was a joke. I was in
a sore place. Literally, a very, very sore place."

1643
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:40,006
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

1644
01:38:40,006 --> 01:38:42,153
MATT: "I wanted to apologize for that."

1645
01:38:42,153 --> 01:38:44,215
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

1646
01:38:44,215 --> 01:38:49,789
MATT: "I should go." He starts walking past you,
out into the main street.

1647
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:54,413
TRAVIS: Kern. Kord's strength to you, my friend.

1648
01:38:54,413 --> 01:38:57,341
MATT: He doesn't even look back to you. "Uh, you
too!" and keeps walking.

1649
01:38:57,341 --> 01:38:59,357
(laughter)

1650
01:38:59,357 --> 01:39:02,721
TALIESIN: Wow. Wow.

1651
01:39:02,721 --> 01:39:04,511
TRAVIS: I go back into the tavern.

1652
01:39:04,511 --> 01:39:05,515
MATT: Okay.

1653
01:39:05,515 --> 01:39:06,949
SAM: Did you kill him, Grog?

1654
01:39:06,949 --> 01:39:10,452
TRAVIS: Yep, yep, there's a lot of pieces of him
all over the alley!

1655
01:39:10,452 --> 01:39:11,773
SAM: That's my boy.

1656
01:39:11,773 --> 01:39:15,274
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like, left nothing to find. It's
great.

1657
01:39:15,274 --> 01:39:16,799
SAM: All right.

1658
01:39:16,799 --> 01:39:18,750
LAURA: I walked out and they were making out.

1659
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:21,260
TRAVIS: Shut the-- that is <i>not</i> what we were
doing.

1660
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:23,012
LAURA: Mugging down in the alleyway.

1661
01:39:23,012 --> 01:39:26,709
MARISHA: Ooh, Grog! I didn't know you swung that
way.

1662
01:39:26,709 --> 01:39:28,314
TRAVIS: Swung what way?

1663
01:39:28,314 --> 01:39:30,727
MARISHA: Toward-- never mind.

1664
01:39:30,727 --> 01:39:31,917
SAM: Swung your axe.

1665
01:39:31,917 --> 01:39:34,111
MARY: Could I have another cup of coffee here?

1666
01:39:34,111 --> 01:39:36,863
MATT: "Of course, coming your way."

1667
01:39:36,863 --> 01:39:43,930
LIAM: No man's-- you know-- goes straight on. Goes
a little bit to the left, a bit of--

1668
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:45,661
WILL: Some men go straight on.

1669
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:47,810
LIAM: I go sit down next to Kash.

1670
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:52,166
LAURA: I sit down next to the other side of Kash,
in between him and Keyleth.

1671
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:54,149
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and watch right next to
you.

1672
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:55,299
MATT: All right.

1673
01:39:55,299 --> 01:39:57,295
MARISHA: (yelling) Another drink!

1674
01:39:57,295 --> 01:39:59,968
LAURA: How about, Keyleth, not another drink.

1675
01:39:59,968 --> 01:40:01,013
MARISHA: What?

1676
01:40:01,013 --> 01:40:02,717
LAURA: How about you have some water, dear.

1677
01:40:02,717 --> 01:40:04,608
MARISHA: Mm, it's been a long few weeks.

1678
01:40:04,608 --> 01:40:08,298
MARY: Come here, Keyleth darling, we'll get some
coffee.

1679
01:40:08,298 --> 01:40:10,519
TALIESIN: No coffee for me, thank you.

1680
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:16,631
LIAM: Excuse me, if I may. All I want to say is
that you are a very impressive man in many ways.

1681
01:40:16,631 --> 01:40:20,101
You are handsome and capable.

1682
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:22,468
LAURA: Your eyes are two different colors, which
is very interesting.

1683
01:40:22,468 --> 01:40:28,634
LIAM: That's a little creepy, but other than that,
you are very, very capable-- Percival, I'm having

1684
01:40:28,634 --> 01:40:33,390
trouble focusing, so if you could sort of go
behind Kash.

1685
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:36,629
WILL: I don't know what's happening. I don't know
what's happening. Is he hitting on me?

1686
01:40:36,629 --> 01:40:37,891
What's happening?

1687
01:40:37,891 --> 01:40:40,531
LIAM: No, no. No, no, no, no. There's only one man
for me.

1688
01:40:40,531 --> 01:40:42,198
WILL: What?

1689
01:40:42,198 --> 01:40:44,340
LIAM: All I'm saying is--

1690
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,578
MARY: What man is that?

1691
01:40:45,578 --> 01:40:52,447
LIAM: (slurring) We could use your help, all
right? I know you're a bit of a mercenary, but you

1692
01:40:52,447 --> 01:40:57,773
are a very capable man and there is a lot at
stake. There is a lot at stake. There are dragons,

1693
01:40:57,773 --> 01:41:06,776
they killed-- I'm not going to get into it. But I
implore you to look past yourself and please try

1694
01:41:06,776 --> 01:41:12,799
to think of the greater world. (stuttering) I'm an
admirer--

1695
01:41:12,799 --> 01:41:15,805
WILL: You've said several times that you're an
admirer of mine.

1696
01:41:15,805 --> 01:41:16,816
LIAM: Yes.

1697
01:41:16,816 --> 01:41:17,787
WILL: Very sweet.

1698
01:41:17,787 --> 01:41:19,205
LIAM: Also, one last thing.

1699
01:41:19,205 --> 01:41:20,229
WILL: Mm-hmm?

1700
01:41:20,229 --> 01:41:24,978
LIAM: You know what, never mind. I don't want to
talk about that. And I wander off into the other

1701
01:41:24,978 --> 01:41:26,298
side of the room.

1702
01:41:26,298 --> 01:41:28,333
WILL: I have literally no idea what just
happened.

1703
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:32,345
SAM: (laughs) He's a complicated man. He goes to
dark places.

1704
01:41:32,345 --> 01:41:33,517
LAURA: Keyleth.

1705
01:41:33,517 --> 01:41:34,874
Maybe you should go see what's happening?

1706
01:41:34,874 --> 01:41:36,487
LIAM: (muffled) It's dark in this closet!

1707
01:41:36,487 --> 01:41:37,697
MARISHA: What?

1708
01:41:37,697 --> 01:41:42,772
LAURA: Go, maybe you should go see what is going
on with my brother? Maybe you should go find out

1709
01:41:42,772 --> 01:41:44,535
what's happening with my brother.

1710
01:41:44,535 --> 01:41:47,584
LIAM: How do you get this closet door open? I
can't get back out here.

1711
01:41:47,584 --> 01:41:50,047
LAURA: He's stuck in a closet.

1712
01:41:50,047 --> 01:41:52,421
MARY: It's all right. Girl talk. So, Keyleth.

1713
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:54,525
MARISHA: What. What. What?

1714
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:59,240
MARY: I heard a little. I wasn't sure and I then
saw you and I thought oh, all right, well, you

1715
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:05,779
know, yeah, all right. So, what, you know? With
the what? (whispers) What happened? With him?

1716
01:42:05,779 --> 01:42:09,043
MARISHA: I literally never even had this
experience in high school, it's throwing me.

1717
01:42:09,043 --> 01:42:11,043
MARY: (whispers) Come on.

1718
01:42:11,043 --> 01:42:12,660
MARISHA: I don't know how to react to any of
this.

1719
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:17,118
LIAM: What is high school?

1720
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:22,365
LAURA: Keyleth. She's talking about you kissing
Kash.

1721
01:42:22,365 --> 01:42:23,233
MARY: Yeah.

1722
01:42:23,233 --> 01:42:24,525
MARISHA: Oh! Right! Oh!

1723
01:42:24,525 --> 01:42:25,871
MARY: He told me. He told me a little bit.

1724
01:42:25,871 --> 01:42:29,747
MARISHA: Funny you mention that, yeah, you know--

1725
01:42:29,747 --> 01:42:31,182
LAURA: Wasn't he your first kiss?

1726
01:42:31,182 --> 01:42:32,742
MARY: Do you like him?

1727
01:42:32,742 --> 01:42:33,885
LAURA: Isn't that so wonderful?

1728
01:42:33,885 --> 01:42:35,400
MARY: I know, it's wonderful. Do you like him?

1729
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:47,088
MARISHA: I, um, you know, okay, I'm kind of new to
all of this. I don't really know what's going on?

1730
01:42:47,088 --> 01:42:49,119
MARY: What, to talking? You're doing very well.

1731
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,169
MARISHA: Thank you. I'm new to that as well.

1732
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:52,103
MARY: No!

1733
01:42:52,103 --> 01:42:53,381
MARISHA: Um--

1734
01:42:53,381 --> 01:42:56,442
LAURA: I'll give you a helpful hint.

1735
01:42:56,442 --> 01:42:58,070
MARISHA: Okay. Yes.

1736
01:42:58,070 --> 01:43:02,331
LAURA: If you're interested in someone, make sure
they know.

1737
01:43:02,331 --> 01:43:03,786
MARISHA: (breathless) Oh.

1738
01:43:03,786 --> 01:43:10,377
LAURA: And if you're not, then stop fucking
dragging them along, because it's not fair.

1739
01:43:10,377 --> 01:43:15,585
MARY: What if she doesn't know? What if she can't
decide?

1740
01:43:15,585 --> 01:43:19,937
MARISHA: Oh, you think I'm dragging Kash along? Oh
no no no no no.

1741
01:43:19,937 --> 01:43:22,708
LAURA: Sure. You're dragging Kash along.

1742
01:43:22,708 --> 01:43:27,214
MARISHA: I mean, he was just, I only spent a day
with him.

1743
01:43:27,214 --> 01:43:28,525
LAURA: Mmm.

1744
01:43:28,525 --> 01:43:30,070
MARISHA: It was just a day.

1745
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:34,338
LIAM: Vex! I can't get out of this closet.

1746
01:43:34,338 --> 01:43:35,356
WILL: Jesus.

1747
01:43:35,356 --> 01:43:37,680
LAURA: Is he really, truly stuck in a closet?
Right now?

1748
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:41,176
MARISHA: I thought he was a lockpick.

1749
01:43:41,176 --> 01:43:42,824
LAURA: (laughing) I go, I walk away.

1750
01:43:42,824 --> 01:43:44,910
LIAM: (mournfully) I rolled a one.

1751
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:49,754
MARISHA: This is literally the only thing Vax is
good at. He really can't get out of the closet?

1752
01:43:49,754 --> 01:43:53,390
TALIESIN: I just want to say, I don't think the
dragons stand a chance.

1753
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,995
(laughter)

1754
01:43:55,995 --> 01:43:57,428
WILL: We've got them now!

1755
01:43:57,428 --> 01:44:02,595
LIAM: I can't get out of this closet as hard as I
try.

1756
01:44:02,595 --> 01:44:04,475
LAURA: What are you doing? Stop it.

1757
01:44:04,475 --> 01:44:10,808
MARISHA: Seriously though (quietly) I'm really
confused.

1758
01:44:10,808 --> 01:44:16,512
MARY: I know, don't hurt him. He's wonderful.

1759
01:44:16,512 --> 01:44:17,606
MARISHA: Kash?

1760
01:44:17,606 --> 01:44:19,000
MARISHA: Okay.

1761
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,696
MARY: He's wonderful.

1762
01:44:20,696 --> 01:44:23,752
MARISHA: Okay.

1763
01:44:23,752 --> 01:44:28,086
MARY: If you do-- he's wonderful.

1764
01:44:28,086 --> 01:44:31,440
TALIESIN: My god, I love other people's problems.

1765
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,875
SAM: This is amazing. Sorry about this, Kash.

1766
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:35,446
WILL: No, this has been wonderful.

1767
01:44:35,446 --> 01:44:37,304
SAM: When our party gets--

1768
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:39,153
WILL: I have men and women telling me I'm
incredible.

1769
01:44:39,153 --> 01:44:40,533
TALIESIN: You are very attractive.

1770
01:44:40,533 --> 01:44:41,801
WILL: That's, wow, that's two.

1771
01:44:41,801 --> 01:44:47,851
SAM: I just met you, and I don't know much about
you, but are you more of a Vax man or a Vex man?

1772
01:44:47,851 --> 01:44:50,094
Like, how do you roll? How do you--?

1773
01:44:50,094 --> 01:44:52,564
WILL: I don't, again, I don't know what that
means.

1774
01:44:52,564 --> 01:44:54,499
(laughter)

1775
01:44:54,499 --> 01:44:56,790
SAM: Would you be interested in the rogue or the
ranger?

1776
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,088
LIAM: We're identical.

1777
01:44:58,088 --> 01:45:05,485
WILL: Oh. Oh! I see what you're saying. All right,
I get it. I go taco, not hot dog.

1778
01:45:05,485 --> 01:45:06,669
SAM: Okay.

1779
01:45:06,669 --> 01:45:08,534
TRAVIS: Yes! I love taco!

1780
01:45:08,534 --> 01:45:12,081
SAM: High five it.

1781
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:15,210
TRAVIS: Respect. Respect.

1782
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:18,071
LAURA: Are we sober yet? Can we go find Kima?

1783
01:45:18,071 --> 01:45:19,431
MARY: Yes, we're sober!

1784
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:20,980
LIAM: I think we need to go to bed.

1785
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:22,965
MARY: Yes. Let's get a break.

1786
01:45:22,965 --> 01:45:29,234
MATT: After a brief time of coffee and a bit of
sobering, you find yourselves of sound enough mind.

1787
01:45:29,234 --> 01:45:31,232
LIAM: 17 hours later?!

1788
01:45:31,232 --> 01:45:32,742
(laughter)

1789
01:45:32,742 --> 01:45:34,046
TALIESIN: Coffee, coffee.

1790
01:45:34,046 --> 01:45:36,016
MARY: I metabolize things very quickly, you'd be
surprised.

1791
01:45:36,016 --> 01:45:38,425
MATT: A few hours, two hours, let's say. It's
four, five o'clock in the afternoon.

1792
01:45:38,425 --> 01:45:39,840
MARISHA: Five o'clock?

1793
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,440
TALIESIN: Or four o'clock. Four o'clock.

1794
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:47,541
MATT: As you, sobering up, the coffee's helped.
You find yourself clear of mind to continue onto

1795
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:53,700
your intended events for the day. With that, we're
going to go ahead and take a break. We'll be back here--

1796
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,477
(cheering)

1797
01:45:55,477 --> 01:45:59,433
WILL: (laughs) Dragons don't stand a chance!

1798
01:45:59,433 --> 01:46:01,751
(laughter)

1799
01:46:01,751 --> 01:46:03,342
WILL: (laughs) That was awesome.

1800
01:46:03,342 --> 01:46:05,741
MATT: All right, guys, we'll see you here in a few
minutes. Thank you.

1801
01:46:05,741 --> 01:46:07,518
(laughter)

1802
01:46:07,518 --> 01:46:12,384
LIAM: That was great. Man.

1803
01:46:12,384 --> 01:59:09,304
[break]

1804
01:59:09,304 --> 01:59:13,272
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So, before we get
back into this, a couple quick announcements. One,

1805
01:59:13,272 --> 01:59:19,768
if we get to 15,000 subscribers tonight,
tomorrow's crew will be celebrating 15k and a

1806
01:59:19,768 --> 01:59:26,623
Cosplay Day. All of our crew will be dressing up
as their favorite characters all night. So you

1807
01:59:26,623 --> 01:59:29,586
guys should go ahead and see if we can hit that
number, because that would be awesome and

1808
01:59:29,586 --> 01:59:30,986
hilarious and awesome.

1809
01:59:30,986 --> 01:59:34,222
LAURA: I might have heard what some people are
going to be dressing up as and I'm very excited

1810
01:59:34,222 --> 01:59:35,150
about it.

1811
01:59:35,150 --> 01:59:38,269
MATT: I heard a couple, too. You guys would enjoy
it, so make it happen, please. I want to see it.

1812
01:59:38,269 --> 01:59:44,180
Also, a reminder that if you want to help support
the channel, check out the Geek and Sundry Amazon

1813
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:50,573
Wish List. You can find the list in chat if you
type "!Wishlist" there and that will give you

1814
01:59:50,573 --> 01:59:53,720
access to it and you can see if there's any way
you want to help build the channel and make it

1815
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:59,755
more awesome. So there's that. Liam will join us
when he can. But we're going to jump in for the

1816
01:59:59,755 --> 02:00:09,579
time being. So, as you guys exit the tavern, you
look out into the Braving Fields.

1817
02:00:09,579 --> 02:00:12,210
TALIESIN: I suddenly remember to go back and open
the closet.

1818
02:00:12,210 --> 02:00:16,017
MARISHA: Oh shit, we need to get the rogue out of
the closet.

1819
02:00:16,017 --> 02:00:21,365
MATT: There is that, yeah. So you're in the center
of the Braving Grounds--

1820
02:00:21,365 --> 02:00:24,296
we traded Liam for Travis.

1821
02:00:24,296 --> 02:00:25,891
LAURA: Yeah. I don't know.

1822
02:00:25,891 --> 02:00:27,501
MATT: Exactly.

1823
02:00:27,501 --> 02:00:29,749
LIAM: Grog, can you get this door open?

1824
02:00:29,749 --> 02:00:31,500
(laughter)

1825
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:35,291
MARY: It is open, darling. Come on.

1826
02:00:35,291 --> 02:00:38,730
SAM: Are we going to Kima now, or are we going to
go see Grog fight?

1827
02:00:38,730 --> 02:00:41,354
LIAM: Is Grog fighting?

1828
02:00:41,354 --> 02:00:48,246
MATT: To your left, around the Heaven's Stair, the
giant mountain that bisects the northern portion

1829
02:00:48,246 --> 02:00:54,580
of Vasselheim, around that way, a little bit of
travel, but that heads towards the Bahamut section

1830
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:58,844
of the city, where the Platinum Sanctuary is. To
your vision, immediately outside the tavern, you

1831
02:00:58,844 --> 02:01:02,585
can see the giant statue of Kord, where the Trial
Forge is. And to the south of you is where the

1832
02:01:02,585 --> 02:01:05,442
Quadroads are, in the southern regions. What do
you guys want to do?

1833
02:01:05,442 --> 02:01:10,291
TRAVIS: I don't really feel like fighting. I just
want to go talk to Master Splinter at the Trial Forge.

1834
02:01:10,291 --> 02:01:14,976
SAM: Sure, sure. All right, we can do that another
day, maybe? Or do you want to--?

1835
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:17,223
TRAVIS: I'm not in a rush.

1836
02:01:17,223 --> 02:01:21,080
LAURA: Should we go to the Platinum Sanctuary?
Where Kima is, right?

1837
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:22,385
TALIESIN: Let's go talk to Kima.

1838
02:01:22,385 --> 02:01:23,668
LIAM: Yeah, right now.

1839
02:01:23,668 --> 02:01:26,873
LAURA: Oh, should we wait until some people are
more sober?

1840
02:01:26,873 --> 02:01:29,789
MARY: No, I'm all right, coffee helps. Coffee
helps.

1841
02:01:29,789 --> 02:01:32,339
LAURA: Walking will help.

1842
02:01:32,339 --> 02:01:34,042
MARY: Walking and coffee.

1843
02:01:34,042 --> 02:01:39,264
SAM: Maybe we should-- they can wait outside or
something.

1844
02:01:39,264 --> 02:01:40,802
MARISHA: But I miss Kima.

1845
02:01:40,802 --> 02:01:42,040
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

1846
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:50,416
MATT: It's been a few hours, and you guys have had
some coffee, so you're still a little tipsy, but

1847
02:01:50,416 --> 02:01:54,589
you're not useless.

1848
02:01:54,589 --> 02:01:58,048
(laughter)

1849
02:01:58,048 --> 02:02:02,122
MATT: To put it nicely. All right, so where do you
guys want to head into--?

1850
02:02:02,122 --> 02:02:04,231
LAURA: The Platinum Sanctuary.

1851
02:02:04,231 --> 02:02:10,332
MATT: All right, you guys make your way south,
southwest around the curvature of the base of the

1852
02:02:10,332 --> 02:02:17,209
Heaven's Stair. You can see up along the mountain
itself, large, ominous, this monolith of earth

1853
02:02:17,209 --> 02:02:21,769
that looks over the entirety of Vasselheim. You
can see embedded in the rock itself, there are

1854
02:02:21,769 --> 02:02:26,316
various homesteads toward the base. As you look
up, you can see there's a number of stairways that

1855
02:02:26,316 --> 02:02:31,907
just spiral around in different directions. You
can see small cliffs and precipices that are built

1856
02:02:31,907 --> 02:02:37,054
on the outside and look to be either various
places of individual worship where statues are

1857
02:02:37,054 --> 02:02:42,142
just barely visible, cresting on the edge. There's
a number of constructs, just built into this

1858
02:02:42,142 --> 02:02:45,142
mountain, that are probably as old as the city
itself.

1859
02:02:45,142 --> 02:02:52,314
You make your way around the south portion of it
back into the actual area of Vasselheim, the

1860
02:02:52,314 --> 02:02:59,751
Silver Talon's Reach, which is where largely 
Bahamut's worship occurs. You make your way past the

1861
02:02:59,751 --> 02:03:08,017
scattered temples, all the different huts and
hovels that build the central residential real

1862
02:03:08,017 --> 02:03:12,468
estate to this territory. There are a few homes
here that look a little bit like-- this town is

1863
02:03:12,468 --> 02:03:20,179
built on existing in hardship and difficulty, so a
lot of people here are just stern folk that live

1864
02:03:20,179 --> 02:03:27,849
amongst terrible weather and money and wealth
isn't really presented or flaunted in this city.

1865
02:03:27,849 --> 02:03:31,483
It's considered in very poor taste as everyone
here is in some way, shape or form, to some level,

1866
02:03:31,483 --> 02:03:37,202
is pious to some degree to one of the deities that
are worshipped here. You find your way to the base

1867
02:03:37,202 --> 02:03:43,135
of the stair that you recall, following when you
first arrived here in Vasselheim, that leads up to

1868
02:03:43,135 --> 02:03:46,710
the Platinum Sanctuary where you were delivering
the Horn of Orcus originally.

1869
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:48,233
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

1870
02:03:48,233 --> 02:03:55,281
MATT: You follow it up the side and it is an
extended staircase that curves up to these three

1871
02:03:55,281 --> 02:04:02,512
silver spires that are pushing out from the side
of the mountain, quite a ways up. After about

1872
02:04:02,512 --> 02:04:05,434
almost 20 minutes of stair climbing, your legs
start to cramp a bit, but you manage to make your

1873
02:04:05,434 --> 02:04:10,489
way towards the top, the outside of the large
stone doors. There you can see there are two

1874
02:04:10,489 --> 02:04:19,245
Scalebearers of Vord, in their silver armor, blue
cloaks at their back, weapons at the ready, just

1875
02:04:19,245 --> 02:04:23,209
looking out. And as soon as you guys approach the
top of the stairway, they change their stance to

1876
02:04:23,209 --> 02:04:25,460
be a little more prepared.

1877
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:28,987
MARISHA: (panting) Guys, this is hard to do 
with alcohol in your system.

1878
02:04:28,987 --> 02:04:31,720
WILL: Hard to do at all.

1879
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:34,298
LIAM: A lot of horses and chickens around here,
too.

1880
02:04:34,298 --> 02:04:35,733
WILL: I noticed that as well.

1881
02:04:35,733 --> 02:04:36,777
LIAM: Everywhere.

1882
02:04:36,777 --> 02:04:38,738
MARISHA: I didn't know this was a farming
industry.

1883
02:04:38,738 --> 02:04:44,626
SAM: Hello there. Excuse us. We are of the
Slayer's Take-- Is that a good thing?

1884
02:04:44,626 --> 02:04:45,779
LAURA: Yes.

1885
02:04:45,779 --> 02:04:50,737
SAM: We are of the Slayer's Take and we ask for
entry into your Platinum Temple.

1886
02:04:50,737 --> 02:04:52,888
MATT: "Your business is with whom?"

1887
02:04:52,888 --> 02:04:54,442
LAURA: Lady Kima.

1888
02:04:54,442 --> 02:05:05,044
MATT: Turns, nods to the other guy. They both grab
these small handles and give a tug, and the door

1889
02:05:05,044 --> 02:05:11,372
opens slightly and one of the guys disappears
between the two doors. About 30 seconds pass to a

1890
02:05:11,372 --> 02:05:19,000
minute, before he steps back out. "Your presence
has been accepted by the Highbearer Vord, the

1891
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,989
"Silvertouched. He will greet you in the central
chamber, please."

1892
02:05:22,989 --> 02:05:26,662
SAM: Thank you. How do we address him?

1893
02:05:26,662 --> 02:05:30,680
MATT: "Highbearer would suffice."

1894
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:32,305
SAM: All right.

1895
02:05:32,305 --> 02:05:33,519
MATT: "Please enter."

1896
02:05:33,519 --> 02:05:35,327
LIAM: Will Kima be there?

1897
02:05:35,327 --> 02:05:38,569
MATT: He doesn't answer. The doors open even
wider.

1898
02:05:38,569 --> 02:05:40,374
LIAM: Hey!

1899
02:05:40,374 --> 02:05:53,121
MATT: So as you guys enter the chamber once more,
this is close to where you flew in in bird form

1900
02:05:53,121 --> 02:05:55,092
and almost got arrested by the Highbearers.

1901
02:05:55,092 --> 02:05:56,861
MARISHA: Uh-huh, right, those guys.

1902
02:05:56,861 --> 02:06:01,051
MATT: So, as you enter the chamber, you see a
number of the guards have already assembled and

1903
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:09,601
they're giving you a walkway path, both as a
presentory arrival vigil, but also making sure

1904
02:06:09,601 --> 02:06:14,991
that you don't wander off the predestined path to
the main central meeting chamber.

1905
02:06:14,991 --> 02:06:17,036
WILL: But it doesn't seem antagonistic in any
way.

1906
02:06:17,036 --> 02:06:19,939
MATT: No. Just-- they're protecting their temple.

1907
02:06:19,939 --> 02:06:21,672
SAM: We'll make it that, though.

1908
02:06:21,672 --> 02:06:32,727
MATT: You guys continue inward, towards the
central chamber, the high stone ceiling before

1909
02:06:32,727 --> 02:06:38,524
you. You can see there are holes carved throughout
the ceiling and the stonework that cause beams of

1910
02:06:38,524 --> 02:06:44,794
light to come shooting through from the sky. What
catches your interest in here is that the sky is

1911
02:06:44,794 --> 02:06:50,502
cloudy. There is no specific source of direct
sunlight, yet there are beams of light within the

1912
02:06:50,502 --> 02:06:57,634
temple itself that form a pattern across the stone
marble floor of the central chamber.

1913
02:06:57,634 --> 02:06:59,216
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

1914
02:06:59,216 --> 02:07:00,803
MATT: Certainly.

1915
02:07:00,803 --> 02:07:02,820
LAURA: What's the pattern look like?

1916
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:06,522
MATT: The pattern resembles a large shield, when
you look at it. It's pointed toward the base of

1917
02:07:06,522 --> 02:07:12,068
where you guys are walking in and fills most of
the chamber in an oval fashion, before coming

1918
02:07:12,068 --> 02:07:14,545
together in a line towards the back.

1919
02:07:14,545 --> 02:07:16,633
MARISHA: 17.

1920
02:07:16,633 --> 02:07:23,571
MATT: 17? Okay, this definitely isn't a natural
occurrence. The sunlight should not be projecting

1921
02:07:23,571 --> 02:07:27,122
this way, which leads you to believe that there's
something about the temple's enchantment or its

1922
02:07:27,122 --> 02:07:34,439
construction that can either dissipate the veil of
clouds to the sunlight or produce their own light

1923
02:07:34,439 --> 02:07:36,416
to mimic it during all hours.

1924
02:07:36,416 --> 02:07:37,485
MARISHA: Cool.

1925
02:07:37,485 --> 02:07:40,176
WILL: Do any of us recognize the symbol on the
floor?

1926
02:07:40,176 --> 02:07:46,296
MATT: You've seen-- the shield itself is akin to
the symbol of Bahamut, which is a shield with a

1927
02:07:46,296 --> 02:07:49,876
silver dragon head on it. You've seen Kima use it
previously when you guys were looking after her in

1928
02:07:49,876 --> 02:07:51,140
the Underdark.

1929
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:53,388
LAURA: We never got that stuff back.

1930
02:07:53,388 --> 02:07:55,202
SAM: Her stuff?

1931
02:07:55,202 --> 02:07:56,451
LAURA: Yeah.

1932
02:07:56,451 --> 02:08:04,094
MATT: As you guys push to the central chamber, you
can see there's a line of three heavily armored

1933
02:08:04,094 --> 02:08:10,960
Knights of Bahamut that are all there, standing
shields at the ready, big tower shields that

1934
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:17,063
almost touch the ground. Two of them separate to
one side and one separates to the other, and in

1935
02:08:17,063 --> 02:08:25,054
the center, arriving before you, is Highbearer
Vord, the Silvertouched, who some of you are

1936
02:08:25,054 --> 02:08:32,145
seeing for the first time. Long, light brown hair
that crests down past his shoulders, his features

1937
02:08:32,145 --> 02:08:39,063
are very elven, very soft and ageless, but there
is a very faint bluish hue to his skin. His eyes

1938
02:08:39,063 --> 02:08:48,900
have no irises, no pupils. Steps forward and
extends his hands. "It is good to see such

1939
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:58,224
"friends, so I ask you once again to join me in
this chamber. Can I help you?"

1940
02:08:58,224 --> 02:09:00,396
LIAM: (whispers) Yes.

1941
02:09:00,396 --> 02:09:12,905
LAURA: You can, actually. Well, we hope that you
can, as it concerns dragon matters. We know that

1942
02:09:12,905 --> 02:09:25,932
you serve Bahamut, the great, the wonderful, the
very metallic. These very terrible colored--

1943
02:09:25,932 --> 02:09:30,703
chromatic red, green, lots of different dragons,
they've attacked--

1944
02:09:30,703 --> 02:09:35,473
SAM: How much do you know about the dragon attacks
that have been raging across the world?

1945
02:09:35,473 --> 02:09:42,707
MATT: He looks about the rest of you, with a
discerning glance, just spending a beat on each of

1946
02:09:42,707 --> 02:09:49,816
you, almost like you're being judged and read in
that instant. You feel as if someone is prying

1947
02:09:49,816 --> 02:09:54,163
into your personality with but a glance, and it's
unsettling at first, but nothing too invasive,

1948
02:09:54,163 --> 02:10:01,904
just enough to catch you off guard. As he finishes
the sweep of the party at hand: "I was given a

1949
02:10:01,904 --> 02:10:12,687
"vision in the night of a far city of man, swathed
in ice and flame, of colors bonded and unleashed.

1950
02:10:12,687 --> 02:10:18,383
"And I feared it was the work of our lord's
nemesis."

1951
02:10:18,383 --> 02:10:22,589
LAURA: Straight-up nemesis?

1952
02:10:22,589 --> 02:10:24,767
MARISHA: Yes, can you elaborate?

1953
02:10:24,767 --> 02:10:25,884
MATT: He puts his hand up.

1954
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:27,144
MARISHA: Sorry.

1955
02:10:27,144 --> 02:10:35,111
MATT: "However, with much prayer of mine and my
acolytes, we find no tremor of the Dragon Queen,

1956
02:10:35,111 --> 02:10:39,292
"nor the stench of Baator, on this business."

1957
02:10:39,292 --> 02:10:43,813
MARISHA: Dragon Queen Baator? Is that what he
said? Baator?

1958
02:10:43,813 --> 02:10:45,787
MATT: Baator. B-a-a-t-o-r.

1959
02:10:45,787 --> 02:10:49,694
MARY: Is the Queen-- I'm sorry-- are the Queen and
Baator the same?

1960
02:10:49,694 --> 02:10:52,757
MATT: Make a religion check.

1961
02:10:52,757 --> 02:10:54,145
LAURA: All of us or just--?

1962
02:10:54,145 --> 02:10:59,044
MATT: All of you, sure. Make a religion check.

1963
02:10:59,044 --> 02:11:03,153
LAURA: 20!

1964
02:11:03,153 --> 02:11:04,551
MARISHA: Ten.

1965
02:11:04,551 --> 02:11:05,601
LAURA: 12.

1966
02:11:05,601 --> 02:11:06,906
MARY: 15.

1967
02:11:06,906 --> 02:11:08,510
TRAVIS: 18!

1968
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:09,514
WILL: 24.

1969
02:11:09,514 --> 02:11:10,379
LIAM: 13.

1970
02:11:10,379 --> 02:11:11,383
TALIESIN: 13.

1971
02:11:11,383 --> 02:11:12,652
WILL: 24.

1972
02:11:12,652 --> 02:11:21,567
MATT: Okay. None of these ring a bell, except for
you, Kashaw. The Dragon Queen is indeed the

1973
02:11:21,567 --> 02:11:29,148
nemesis of the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut. It is an
entity known as Tiamat and is essentially the

1974
02:11:29,148 --> 02:11:37,023
patron of most chromatic dragons. She resides in
Baator, which is one of the Nine Hells.

1975
02:11:37,023 --> 02:11:38,623
LAURA: Eugh.

1976
02:11:38,623 --> 02:11:50,324
MATT: However, it seems that Vord is speaking in a
way that, through much disturbed interest and

1977
02:11:50,324 --> 02:12:00,774
prayer into this matter, there doesn't seem to be
the scent of Tiamat's doing in this matter. And

1978
02:12:00,774 --> 02:12:06,126
strangely, you see a bit of the tension in his
face relax as he tells you this.

1979
02:12:06,126 --> 02:12:15,868
LAURA: So, if it's not the nemesis, the big
nemesis, then you guys could probably take out

1980
02:12:15,868 --> 02:12:21,624
these dragons, like, no problem, since they're not
the Big Bads, they're just really bad.

1981
02:12:21,624 --> 02:12:33,088
MATT: "While these entities do concern us, there
is the alternate vow that we've spoken, and that

1982
02:12:33,088 --> 02:12:40,824
"is to protect Vasselheim. The city has stood as
long as it has because we have not left our post.

1983
02:12:40,824 --> 02:12:51,101
"And the moment that we were to attempt to move
even a minority of our people in the city to be of

1984
02:12:51,101 --> 02:12:56,957
"aid to you in this endeavor, this would be the
moment that the Dragon Queen will be waiting for

1985
02:12:56,957 --> 02:13:02,205
"to attack our citadel. There are many more forces
beyond these dragons that you speak of in this

1986
02:13:02,205 --> 02:13:07,662
"world, bent against the destruction of this city.
And we stand because we hold vigil here."

1987
02:13:07,662 --> 02:13:13,540
MARISHA: But, sir, you should understand how close
this destruction came from your doorstep.

1988
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:18,065
MATT: "And yet it avoided our city. Do you know
why? Because even such creatures know better than

1989
02:13:18,065 --> 02:13:20,304
"to lend their talons against us."

1990
02:13:20,304 --> 02:13:24,459
MARISHA: But how do you know that will happen the
next time? Is that always where you're going to

1991
02:13:24,459 --> 02:13:25,923
place your bet?

1992
02:13:25,923 --> 02:13:29,999
MATT: "Do you think this will be the first time
that ancient dragons have attempted to attack our

1993
02:13:29,999 --> 02:13:31,408
"fair city?"

1994
02:13:31,408 --> 02:13:33,307
MARISHA: How about four?

1995
02:13:33,307 --> 02:13:40,817
MATT: "I can guarantee you, should they mount an
attack on us, four or not, they will fall."

1996
02:13:40,817 --> 02:13:43,908
LAURA: Wow, then I guess everybody in the world can
just move here.

1997
02:13:43,908 --> 02:13:49,397
WILL: Wait a second, you said dragons have
attacked before and they were defeated. How?

1998
02:13:49,397 --> 02:13:59,012
MATT: "Well, we had the aid of Bahamut with us at
that time." And he glances up and you look up and

1999
02:13:59,012 --> 02:14:03,456
you can see the rays of sun that have come through
here, from your current position, you can see

2000
02:14:03,456 --> 02:14:09,792
actually form a matching symbol. Not of a shield,
but of a giant winged dragon outstretched across

2001
02:14:09,792 --> 02:14:14,147
the curved roof of this temple.

2002
02:14:14,147 --> 02:14:15,632
LIAM: But let's talk about--

2003
02:14:15,632 --> 02:14:18,270
LAURA: He's saying something.

2004
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:20,205
MARY: Please continue, I'm so sorry.

2005
02:14:20,205 --> 02:14:21,495
LIAM: My bad.

2006
02:14:21,495 --> 02:14:22,897
WILL: We've been drinking.

2007
02:14:22,897 --> 02:14:24,515
MATT: "Drinking?"

2008
02:14:24,515 --> 02:14:27,202
WILL: No. Water. Long walk up.

2009
02:14:27,202 --> 02:14:38,239
MATT: "Well, understand. I hear your plight. And I
understand that we must aid you in this endeavor,

2010
02:14:38,239 --> 02:14:43,716
"best that we can. But we cannot swear to you our
army."

2011
02:14:43,716 --> 02:14:47,583
LAURA: What sort of aid can you offer, then?

2012
02:14:47,583 --> 02:14:56,174
MATT: "Well, now, while you seek out whatever your
plot is to tear these creatures from their summit,

2013
02:14:56,174 --> 02:15:07,189
"we will grant to you, from our place in the Dawn
City, our finest champion. While I have no

2014
02:15:07,189 --> 02:15:14,323
"resources to offer at this time, this champion
shall come to your aid to help in any way that

2015
02:15:14,323 --> 02:15:26,390
"they can. And once they can report their certainty
that victory can be had, perhaps we may be able to

2016
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:28,733
"send a little more of our power your way."

2017
02:15:28,733 --> 02:15:32,846
SAM: Will we know the presence of this champion or
will it be a silent one?

2018
02:15:32,846 --> 02:15:37,941
MATT: "The champion is here." And he steps aside
and puts his hand out. And one of the armored

2019
02:15:37,941 --> 02:15:46,775
knights steps forward, full armor, this tall,
wide-chested masculine form. You can't see the

2020
02:15:46,775 --> 02:15:53,392
face, the helmet protects it, but the shield comes
out and slams the ground and goes to kneel on one knee.

2021
02:15:53,392 --> 02:16:04,980
"Your charge, Platinum Knight Udire, one of our
finest warriors, whom has had time and time again--"

2022
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:09,349
At which point you hear a loud (clang)
sound as all of a sudden, Udire's thrown off of

2023
02:16:09,349 --> 02:16:14,280
his feet, his shield bent in and skidding across
the ground. You see stepping up behind, a female

2024
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,429
halfling, scar across the face--

2025
02:16:17,429 --> 02:16:18,609
LAURA: Fuck yeah!

2026
02:16:18,609 --> 02:16:22,398
MATT: -- gold-trimmed armor, blue cloak behind
her, shouting out, "Oh no, you don't! This is my

2027
02:16:22,398 --> 02:16:24,498
"home turf! I'm going."

2028
02:16:24,498 --> 02:16:27,280
LAURA: Kima!

2029
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:28,490
MARISHA: Yeah, Kima!

2030
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:29,813
TALIESIN: We'll take that one.

2031
02:16:29,813 --> 02:16:30,995
MARISHA: We want that one.

2032
02:16:30,995 --> 02:16:36,477
MATT: Highbearer Vord rolls his eyes and sighs
loudly. (growls) "Kima, you are in need of

2033
02:16:36,477 --> 02:16:42,946
"discipline and guidance. More than most who walk
the Warrior's Path! Your foolish impulses will get

2034
02:16:42,946 --> 02:16:44,402
"you killed!"

2035
02:16:44,402 --> 02:16:48,947
MARISHA: I think her foolish impulses are
<i>exactly</i> what Vox Machina's looking for.

2036
02:16:48,947 --> 02:16:56,589
MATT: She grins as she swings her maul, slams it
onto the stone ground, a little bit of a rumble as

2037
02:16:56,589 --> 02:17:01,525
you see a flash of divine energy from that. And a
beam from the sky comes down and frames her form

2038
02:17:01,525 --> 02:17:07,681
as she stands there clutching the top of it.
"Better to die a fool for something than live in

2039
02:17:07,681 --> 02:17:10,042
"regret for doing nothing."

2040
02:17:10,042 --> 02:17:11,401
TRAVIS: Church!

2041
02:17:11,401 --> 02:17:14,654
(laughter)

2042
02:17:14,654 --> 02:17:21,220
MATT: An awkward pause as Udire gets back up on
his feet and pulls up the front of his helmet. You

2043
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:27,097
can see there's a very thin pencil 'stache
underneath. A chiseled jaw and a man who looks

2044
02:17:27,097 --> 02:17:33,408
like probably an intense, chivalrous-type knight
gentleman, except there's a look of complete

2045
02:17:33,408 --> 02:17:39,140
disdain and frustration. He gets up and goes,
"Really, her?!" Vord raises his hand and grumbles.

2046
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:52,109
"Very well. Your new charge is Lady Kima, whom you
are already affiliated. Please keep her from doing

2047
02:17:52,109 --> 02:17:54,143
"anything stupid."

2048
02:17:54,143 --> 02:18:00,698
SAM: I think we want her to do her stupidest.
Udire, it would have been a swell adventure with

2049
02:18:00,698 --> 02:18:07,958
you, maybe next time. Sir, thank you for granting
us this aid that we will definitely need in our

2050
02:18:07,958 --> 02:18:16,136
journey. We also are new to this dragon-slaying
business and would love your advice and any

2051
02:18:16,136 --> 02:18:22,227
information you might have, especially about some
specific items. Something called the

2052
02:18:22,227 --> 02:18:24,619
Vestiges of Divergence?

2053
02:18:24,619 --> 02:18:35,827
MATT: His eyes squint for a moment as he puts his
hands in front of his face. "Hmm. To step against

2054
02:18:35,827 --> 02:18:43,469
"such powerful dragons is indeed a death sentence.
It's true that you need to prepare, arm yourselves

2055
02:18:43,469 --> 02:18:52,934
"against this doom. While we are meant to stay here
in the most holiest of places, these relics you

2056
02:18:52,934 --> 02:19:02,590
"speak of from before the Second Spark still lie
forgotten. Hmph, these elements even balked the

2057
02:19:02,590 --> 02:19:13,237
"Primordials of old, blades that slew the Children
of the Dark. Where these relics lie, only story

2058

"and tome can tell, unfortunately. Know that at any
given time, you are not the only ones seeking this

2059

"power. Consider things of such great strength are
perpetually in the minds of those who would make

2060

own townships and peasantry under their own boot

2061

"and gauntlet. Well..."

2062
02:19:43,405 --> 02:19:49,088
MARY: Do these Vestiges help you control the
dragons? Do you become their leader if you find them?

2063
02:19:49,088 --> 02:19:57,739
MATT: "I don't believe any of that such
capability, but I also am not a scholar of ancient

2064
02:19:57,739 --> 02:20:08,456
"magics and artifacts. I have merely come across their
whispers in books and various classes I took as a child."

2065
02:20:08,456 --> 02:20:10,881
LAURA: What sort of books? Fairy books?

2066
02:20:10,881 --> 02:20:16,867
MATT: "There are tomes scattered throughout the
city. And there is the Cobalt Reserve."

2067
02:20:16,867 --> 02:20:21,196
LAURA: Cobalt Reserve is gone. The dragons took it
out.

2068
02:20:21,196 --> 02:20:23,874
MATT: "That is unfortunate."

2069
02:20:23,874 --> 02:20:29,836
MARISHA: You said these tomes might still be in
Vasselheim?

2070
02:20:29,836 --> 02:20:32,819
MATT: "Perhaps."

2071
02:20:32,819 --> 02:20:34,273
MARISHA: Where?

2072
02:20:34,273 --> 02:20:43,610
MATT: "I wish I could tell you. We had one such
entrusted to us long ago, but that was destroyed

2073
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:47,667
"as part of the last assault on Vasselheim that we
withstood."

2074
02:20:47,667 --> 02:20:53,550
LAURA: Do you remember the description of any of
the items from your stories?

2075
02:20:53,550 --> 02:20:56,362
SAM: Or how many there were?

2076
02:20:56,362 --> 02:21:11,251
MATT: "The stories say of at least a dozen. I
can't be certain. I wish I could be of more aid in

2077
02:21:11,251 --> 02:21:17,022
"this, but this is not a path that I chose to learn
much on."

2078
02:21:17,022 --> 02:21:26,178
MARISHA: And are all artifacts necessary to
defeating these dragons?

2079
02:21:26,178 --> 02:21:28,099
MATT: "I have no idea."

2080
02:21:28,099 --> 02:21:29,673
LAURA: We should probably have asked--

2081
02:21:29,673 --> 02:21:32,938
MARISHA: Osysa.

2082
02:21:32,938 --> 02:21:40,394
MATT: "Though the warriors that once wielded these
in the battles of old only seemed to have carried

2083
02:21:40,394 --> 02:21:42,317
"one or two each."

2084
02:21:42,317 --> 02:21:48,428
MARY: How did you defeat them? The dragons that
came to your doorstep?

2085
02:21:48,428 --> 02:21:50,888
MATT: "That was before my time, my dear."

2086
02:21:50,888 --> 02:21:57,867
MARY: There are no legends, there are no scrolls
that might recount the tale of how that happened,

2087
02:21:57,867 --> 02:22:00,554
that you might still have somewhere?

2088
02:22:00,554 --> 02:22:12,777
MATT: "Depends. The Second Spark. Hmm." He takes a
moment to gather his thoughts as I take a moment

2089
02:22:12,777 --> 02:22:14,170
to gather my notes.

2090
02:22:14,170 --> 02:22:15,498
(laughter)

2091
02:22:15,498 --> 02:22:17,683
WILL: While you're doing that, Udire's stuck in
his armor over there.

2092
02:22:17,683 --> 02:22:22,360
TRAVIS: Dented in.

2093
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:24,058
WILL: He's just dented in, he can't get out.

2094
02:22:24,058 --> 02:22:27,137
MATT: He's not happy at all about that.

2095
02:22:27,137 --> 02:22:34,381
Hold on. Got it.

2096
02:22:34,381 --> 02:22:37,355
LAURA: Sorry. One moment please.

2097
02:22:37,355 --> 02:22:39,322
MARY: Right here, hold on.

2098
02:22:39,322 --> 02:22:48,142
LIAM: I've got all my dragon lore over here. Just
give me a second.

2099
02:22:48,142 --> 02:22:56,510
MATT: "It's a long tale, and I recommend you
research the history yourself, but during the

2100
02:22:56,510 --> 02:23:06,413
"times of creation, when the gods first came upon
this world, it was a place of chaotic energies,

2101
02:23:06,413 --> 02:23:15,483
"elements clashing. The very landscape itself was
in eternal turmoil, wrestling for no purpose other

2102
02:23:15,483 --> 02:23:23,705
"than the destruction of the others. There were no
boundaries. Yet the gods still came, and they

2103
02:23:23,705 --> 02:23:32,795
"created us, the various beings and entities. As
they came to understand what their purpose was, as

2104
02:23:32,795 --> 02:23:38,459
"they themselves were still uncertain as to why
they came to be, they hoped that through their

2105
02:23:38,459 --> 02:23:44,917
"creations, they could learn more about themselves.
They began to watch the first burgeoning elves,

2106
02:23:44,917 --> 02:23:54,325
"dwarves, people. Within a short time, a very short
time, the very chaotic nature of this landscape

"consumed and destroyed most of what remained. The
only city that stood, the first city: Vasselheim.

"The titans that walked across these lands, great,
primordial elemental kings, beings of no noble

2109

"mind, sought to destroy any light or beauty. Thus
the first war began. The peoples rose up, the gods'

2110
02:24:27,561 --> 02:24:35,446
"feet touched the ground, and alongside their
creations they slew the titans, with the first of

"these Vestiges. Laying them to rest within the
dirt, within the sky, casting the elements away

2112
02:24:45,937 --> 02:24:55,934
"from this plane, and separate to their own, where
now they remain, amidst fire, earth, air, water,

"and their muddy boundaries between.

2114

"Thus came a time of great privilege and
prosperity. And it also came to be discovered that

2115
02:25:11,741 --> 02:25:20,056
"some of the gods, as part of creation during this
bout with the titans, began to question the

"purpose of creation, to embrace the chaos that
they fought in this battle, and they distanced

2117
02:25:26,783 --> 02:25:36,843
"themselves from the ones that guide us to this
day. They began to take the children of the gods,

"to corrupt them, teach them the wonders of arcana,
magics beyond the divine, the gifts of the gods,

"and for the first time, the creations began to
find power separate from the creators. The

"arrogance to think that perhaps, now, they were
gods themselves. Now, they were the gods'

"creations and they loved them very much, so they
did not see this as a threat. But as the second

"expansion of civilization spread across the world,
we saw rise great, new towns and cities and

2123

of insolence and selfishness. And these new dark

"gods began to prey upon this, and build a force to
take those who still stay true to the first. This

"terrible war, this is what we knew as the
Divergence. This is when the people were split in two.

"The gods were divided as well. Bloody battles
ensued. And it looked as though, while all other

"cities fell into ruin, even Vasselheim would fall.
But in this time, these Vestiges were expanded

"upon, those first few weapons, many more were
created. And the Champions fought alongside the

banished to various planes, far from this plane.

"But it was then the gods also decided that perhaps
their delving had caused this, and they receded,

"leaving the mortals to find their own way, to
rebuild a second time, with the warning of the

"dangers of arcane, which Vasselheim still to this
day holds in its prime oaths. Many of these

"Vestiges that you seek were destroyed, but some
were kept, some were lost, some were entombed,

symbols of power. But since this Second Spark of

02:28:13,970 --> 02:28:23,103
"and the gods leaving us to our own. Thus started
the Penance, where to this day, we still make up

2137
02:28:23,103 --> 02:28:33,642
"for the infractions and sins of our arrogant
brothers and sisters of that day. So, since then,

2138
02:28:33,642 --> 02:28:45,175
"we've had other new civilizations spring up:
Wildemount, Tal'Dorei, Syngorn, Marquet. These are

2139
02:28:45,175 --> 02:28:49,622
"the newer cities of the Third Age."

2140
02:28:49,622 --> 02:29:04,963
LIAM: May I ask-- Vestiges, the word in these
legends, it seems vague. Does no one know anything

2141
02:29:04,963 --> 02:29:11,904
about what they were? Is that a stand-in for
things we don't understand or know about? What are

2142
02:29:11,904 --> 02:29:13,360
these Vestiges?

2143
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:22,192
MATT: "We know of them. Understand, artifacts and
relics of this power are very dangerous. And what

2144
02:29:22,192 --> 02:29:30,666
"better way to hide things of such power than to
destroy the knowledge of where they may be or even

2145
02:29:30,666 --> 02:29:32,824
"if they exist?"

2146
02:29:32,824 --> 02:29:36,789
MARISHA: Sir, I come from the Ashari people.

2147
02:29:36,789 --> 02:29:38,087
MATT: "Yes."

2148
02:29:38,087 --> 02:29:48,197
MARISHA: We are here to protect those boundaries
that we set several thousand years ago. Do you

2149
02:29:48,197 --> 02:29:52,097
think that some of this knowledge might still be
within my people?

2150
02:29:52,097 --> 02:30:07,256
MATT: "It is possible. I am not a practitioner of
the history of the Ashari people."

2151
02:30:07,256 --> 02:30:15,982
WILL: Objects with that much power have to leave
some trace somewhere. Anything you can think of, a

2152
02:30:15,982 --> 02:30:17,958
place to start.

2153
02:30:17,958 --> 02:30:30,869
MATT: "Cobalt Reserve. There the monks keep some
of the most ancient of texts. We here at

2154
02:30:30,869 --> 02:30:39,380
"Vasselheim keep a watchful eye on things that
relate to the wars of old, the history of our

2155
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:46,336
"deities, of our temples, to not repeat the
mistakes we have. The monks are more eclectic

2156
02:30:46,336 --> 02:30:50,250
"in their collections. Perhaps they can be of more aid."

2157
02:30:50,250 --> 02:30:55,295
LAURA: Maybe not all of the Reserve was destroyed.
Maybe they have secret rooms underground, where

2158
02:30:55,295 --> 02:30:59,795
they keep the most ancient texts. We should at
least check.

2159
02:30:59,795 --> 02:31:02,821
TALIESIN: It would be worth looking, at the very
least.

2160
02:31:02,821 --> 02:31:04,696
LAURA: Allura was on her way there.

2161
02:31:04,696 --> 02:31:13,540
SAM: Highbearer. These dragons who are running
rampant across the world, them being chromatic

2162
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:17,153
dragons, do you think they have pledged their
loyalty to the Queen?

2163
02:31:17,153 --> 02:31:29,512
MATT: "If they have, it's a very-- no, they would
not be able to shroud the sight of the Platinum

2164
02:31:29,512 --> 02:31:31,476
"Dragon himself."

2165
02:31:31,476 --> 02:31:37,031
LAURA: Isn't it very strange for dragons to
pledge their allegiance to any other dragon?

2166
02:31:37,031 --> 02:31:38,483
MATT: "For chromatics, it is."

2167
02:31:38,483 --> 02:31:40,445
LAURA: Then why are they serving the red one?

2168
02:31:40,445 --> 02:31:41,966
MATT: "The red one?"

2169
02:31:41,966 --> 02:31:43,416
TRAVIS: The Cinder King.

2170
02:31:43,416 --> 02:31:44,633
LAURA: Thordak.

2171
02:31:44,633 --> 02:31:46,765
MARISHA: That's what he calls himself.

2172
02:31:46,765 --> 02:31:51,879
LAURA: He's ancient. He was in the Fire Realm--
the Fire Plane and broke free. And now he has

2173
02:31:51,879 --> 02:31:53,671
other dragons serving him.

2174
02:31:53,671 --> 02:32:05,258
MATT: "Chromatic dragons respond to a few things:
gold, dominance, and strength. If this red dragon

2175
02:32:05,258 --> 02:32:14,006
"is as ancient and as powerful as you say, perhaps
he, even he, could bully lesser dragons."

2176
02:32:14,006 --> 02:32:21,310
MARISHA: Or do you think it's possible he is
offering any one of those rewards?

2177
02:32:21,310 --> 02:32:26,298
MATT: "There are many possibilities. You would
have to ask one of them yourself."

2178
02:32:26,298 --> 02:32:31,723
TALIESIN: I get the distinct feeling we will get
that chance.

2179
02:32:31,723 --> 02:32:38,566
MARISHA: So, if this is the Third Age, does that
mean the Fourth is upon us?

2180
02:32:38,566 --> 02:32:40,650
MATT: "I hope not."

2181
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:42,780
MARISHA: As do I.

2182
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:49,897
MATT: "But if it does, we will do everything we
can to see that this city stands. It is the only

2183
02:32:49,897 --> 02:32:57,787
"link we have to the past. Should Vasselheim fall,
I dare say all is lost."

2184
02:32:57,787 --> 02:33:08,653
MARY: At the cost of everything else, Vasselheim
stands? That's my only question.

2185
02:33:08,653 --> 02:33:12,027
MATT: "That is your question?"

2186
02:33:12,027 --> 02:33:13,444
MARY: Yes.

2187
02:33:13,444 --> 02:33:23,212
MATT: "From here, civilization could spring anew.
People could defend themselves and thrive

2188
02:33:23,212 --> 02:33:32,137
"thereafter. The rest of the world is scattered.
Petty squabbles, selfish personal endeavors that

2189
02:33:32,137 --> 02:33:40,450
"lead to foolishness and treachery. Should this
city fall, and one of those remain, that is a

2190
02:33:40,450 --> 02:33:47,850
"breeding ground for the dark powers that lie
beyond the Veil. It is only here that those who

2191
02:33:47,850 --> 02:33:57,768
"are the most devout could truly have the hearts
and minds to guide us, Bahamut forbid, into a

2192
02:33:57,768 --> 02:33:59,670
"Fourth Age."

2193
02:33:59,670 --> 02:34:07,084
SAM: Well, thank you for all your help. One more
question before we leave you to your--

2194
02:34:07,084 --> 02:34:11,855
MATT: Which you see, Kima slams her hammer on the
ground. "Oh my god! Can we just go? I'm sick of

2195
02:34:11,855 --> 02:34:13,526
"hearing him rattle on."

2196
02:34:13,526 --> 02:34:16,399
Vord puts his hand out. "Kima!"

2197
02:34:16,399 --> 02:34:25,591
SAM: On our journey, we may have to travel long
distances quite often. Is there any means of quick

2198
02:34:25,591 --> 02:34:29,426
travel to other parts of the continent from
Vasselheim?

2199
02:34:29,426 --> 02:34:32,223
LAURA: Perhaps any flying carpets that you have
lying around?

2200
02:34:32,223 --> 02:34:36,266
SAM: Airships, teleportation circles, any means
that you know.

2201
02:34:36,266 --> 02:34:44,833
MATT: "We do not deal in such teleportation magics
beyond the divine-provided ones, and those I

2202
02:34:44,833 --> 02:34:51,174
"assume are beyond most of you. However, there is
still the Skyport, which I believe you arrived in

2203
02:34:51,174 --> 02:34:58,193
"when you first came to us? Other than that, if
none among you are able to achieve any sort of

2204
02:34:58,193 --> 02:35:04,718
"distance translocation, then I highly doubt you
have the ability to stand up against these dragons

2205
02:35:04,718 --> 02:35:06,400
"you seek to destroy."

2206
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:09,671
MARISHA: We got it. It's fine. It's handled.

2207
02:35:09,671 --> 02:35:11,605
LAURA: Thank you for the vote of confidence.

2208
02:35:11,605 --> 02:35:14,164
TALIESIN: I think we have everything we need
here.

2209
02:35:14,164 --> 02:35:18,875
LAURA: Yes, unless you have any amulets or magical
things lying around?

2210
02:35:18,875 --> 02:35:20,792
SAM: How's that Horn of Orcus going, by the way?

2211
02:35:20,792 --> 02:35:22,136
MARISHA: Good question, actually.

2212
02:35:22,136 --> 02:35:23,187
MATT: "Shh!"

2213
02:35:23,187 --> 02:35:24,184
SAM: Oh, sorry.

2214
02:35:24,184 --> 02:35:25,660
TALIESIN: Ix-nay on the orn-hay.

2215
02:35:25,660 --> 02:35:27,150
SAM: Sorry.

2216
02:35:27,150 --> 02:35:29,166
MATT: "And with that--"

2217
02:35:29,166 --> 02:35:33,537
LAURA: So no on the magic items? Of protection?

2218
02:35:33,537 --> 02:35:35,295
MATT: "I have business for the day."

2219
02:35:35,295 --> 02:35:36,652
LAURA: Cool.

2220
02:35:36,652 --> 02:35:38,930
WILL: I'm not going to ask him how his family is.

2221
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:40,472
SAM: No, don't do that.

2222
02:35:40,472 --> 02:35:43,504
MATT: "Show our guests out, please."

2223
02:35:43,504 --> 02:35:52,229
"With pleasure." Slings her maul up on her
shoulder. "Let's step outside first."

2224
02:35:52,229 --> 02:35:53,507
MARISHA: Yeah.

2225
02:35:53,507 --> 02:35:58,180
MATT: And she leads you all outside, the temple
doors close. As soon as the doors close, she tells

2226
02:35:58,180 --> 02:36:06,130
the two guards, "Shove off, please. We have to
have a conversation." The guards kind of

2227
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:10,078
frustratedly turn around and go back and close
the door. As soon as the doors close behind them,

2228
02:36:10,078 --> 02:36:12,094
she goes, "Oh my god, guys!"

2229
02:36:12,094 --> 02:36:13,371
(cheering)

2230
02:36:13,371 --> 02:36:19,160
MATT: She rushes out, gives hugs to everyone that
she knows. She skips you, asks to be introduced

2231
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:21,245
to-- "And--"

2232
02:36:21,245 --> 02:36:23,061
LAURA: Zahra. Kima.

2233
02:36:23,061 --> 02:36:24,109
MARY: I'm Zahra.

2234
02:36:24,109 --> 02:36:25,328
MATT: "Zahra, nice to meet you."

2235
02:36:25,328 --> 02:36:26,676
MARY: Nice to meet you, Kima.

2236
02:36:26,676 --> 02:36:27,893
MATT: "Kima. Lady Kima."

2237
02:36:27,893 --> 02:36:30,143
MARY: Lady Kima. Lady. All right.

2238
02:36:30,143 --> 02:36:31,744
MARISHA: And have you met Kash? Kashaw.

2239
02:36:31,744 --> 02:36:32,962
WILL: Kashaw. Vesh.

2240
02:36:32,962 --> 02:36:34,323
MATT: "Hmph."

2241
02:36:34,323 --> 02:36:35,937
WILL: All right then.

2242
02:36:35,937 --> 02:36:37,794
MATT: "You're brooding."

2243
02:36:37,794 --> 02:36:40,414
WILL: Don't mean to be. It's been a rough-- yes.
Thank you.

2244
02:36:40,414 --> 02:36:42,915
(laughter)

2245
02:36:42,915 --> 02:36:47,844
MATT: "All right, so. I caught some of that
discussion. Dragons? What are we after here?"

2246
02:36:47,844 --> 02:36:50,199
SAM: Big scary dragons.

2247
02:36:50,199 --> 02:36:52,179
MATT: "I tend to glaze over when he's talking."

2248
02:36:52,179 --> 02:36:54,376
LAURA: Emon's gone, Kima.

2249
02:36:54,376 --> 02:36:59,669
TRAVIS: Yeah, basically four big fuck-off
chromatic dragons destroyed Emon and then Westruun

2250
02:36:59,669 --> 02:37:03,760
and-- Allura was there, she was very upset.

2251
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:05,983
MATT: "Is she all right? Is Allie all right?"

2252
02:37:05,983 --> 02:37:07,018
TALIESIN: She's fine.

2253
02:37:07,018 --> 02:37:13,085
TRAVIS: Yeah, Allie is fine.

2254
02:37:13,085 --> 02:37:17,324
LIAM: We just parted ways with her-- (groans) I
have such a headache.

2255
02:37:17,324 --> 02:37:18,731
TALIESIN: Two days ago.

2256
02:37:18,731 --> 02:37:21,168
MATT: "My home temple's in Westruun."

2257
02:37:21,168 --> 02:37:22,528
TRAVIS: Oh.

2258
02:37:22,528 --> 02:37:26,754
LAURA: We should definitely go there. We need to
look at the Cobalt Reserve as well. We need to

2259
02:37:26,754 --> 02:37:30,238
meet up with Allura, though. She was-- (sighs).

2260
02:37:30,238 --> 02:37:33,491
MATT: "All right, well. I'm with you. Wherever you
need me."

2261
02:37:33,491 --> 02:37:40,797
MARISHA: I just pass Vax my water canteen on the
sly.

2262
02:37:40,797 --> 02:37:44,920
LIAM: And I very obviously chug the entire thing.

2263
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:52,712
MATT: "A few of you started early. I'm jealous."

2264
02:37:52,712 --> 02:37:58,010
MARISHA: Kima, it's been very hard since we last
saw you.

2265
02:37:58,010 --> 02:38:01,089
MATT: "I can see it on your faces. You all look a
bit harrowed.

2266
02:38:01,089 --> 02:38:03,217
TRAVIS: Hairy?

2267
02:38:03,217 --> 02:38:09,488
MATT: "You surprise me day after day, Grog."

2268
02:38:09,488 --> 02:38:13,557
TRAVIS: Why, thank you. Don't have to hide it
around me, it's okay.

2269
02:38:13,557 --> 02:38:16,074
MATT: "All right, where are we off to?"

2270
02:38:16,074 --> 02:38:17,639
LAURA: That's a good question.

2271
02:38:17,639 --> 02:38:19,082
MARISHA: Where are we going?

2272
02:38:19,082 --> 02:38:21,599
WILL: Cobalt Reserve, he said twice.

2273
02:38:21,599 --> 02:38:23,390
LAURA: Yes, but that's in Westruun.

2274
02:38:23,390 --> 02:38:24,910
SAM: It's been destroyed.

2275
02:38:24,910 --> 02:38:27,380
LAURA: Not necessarily, I mean yes, it's fucked
up.

2276
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:32,332
TRAVIS: We still need to go talk to Earthbearer
Groon and see what kind of lesson was there.

2277
02:38:32,332 --> 02:38:35,042
MARISHA: I also really need to check out the Fire
Ashari.

2278
02:38:35,042 --> 02:38:37,067
TALIESIN: Fire Ashari are on the way.

2279
02:38:37,067 --> 02:38:42,936
LIAM: Let's count out the things that we want to
do. Not what we're going to choose, just what we

2280
02:38:42,936 --> 02:38:47,664
have to do, and then we'll choose something. We've
got the Cobalt Reserve, which may or may not be

2281
02:38:47,664 --> 02:38:49,203
totally fucked, right?

2282
02:38:49,203 --> 02:38:51,440
MARY: It could give us information about these
dragons.

2283
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:54,195
MARISHA: We need to go by there regardless. We
need to stop by Westruun.

2284
02:38:54,195 --> 02:38:57,604
LIAM: Okay. So there's Osysa's mate.

2285
02:38:57,604 --> 02:38:59,769
LAURA: That's down by Westruun.

2286
02:38:59,769 --> 02:39:01,534
LIAM: Down by Westruun, in the mountains.

2287
02:39:01,534 --> 02:39:03,061
MARISHA: That's on the way.

2288
02:39:03,061 --> 02:39:07,011
LIAM: Yeah. We've got your people.

2289
02:39:07,011 --> 02:39:08,796
MARISHA: Also on the way out the door.

2290
02:39:08,796 --> 02:39:09,746
LAURA: It is?

2291
02:39:09,746 --> 02:39:11,350
MARISHA: It's not far from here.

2292
02:39:11,350 --> 02:39:15,440
MATT: It's roughly three days' travel, southwest
of Vasselheim.

2293
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:17,008
LAURA: But there's trees.

2294
02:39:17,008 --> 02:39:20,679
MARISHA: There are trees. I can also pop through a
tree. I can pop through a tree through most

2295
02:39:20,679 --> 02:39:25,280
places. Pop through a tree and get us to Westruun,
as long as we take a nap.

2296
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,846
LIAM: Three options. Are we forgetting anything?

2297
02:39:27,846 --> 02:39:30,725
LAURA: And Grog wants to talk to--

2298
02:39:30,725 --> 02:39:33,123
TRAVIS: Earthbearer Master Splinter.

2299
02:39:33,123 --> 02:39:34,641
MARISHA: Earthbreaker.

2300
02:39:34,641 --> 02:39:36,195
TALIESIN: While we charter a ship.

2301
02:39:36,195 --> 02:39:40,374
MARISHA: Percy really wants an airship. Dear gods,
does he want an airship.

2302
02:39:40,374 --> 02:39:43,572
TALIESIN: What a perfect way to make our way
quickly and efficiently.

2303
02:39:43,572 --> 02:39:44,881
LIAM: Let's just talk--

2304
02:39:44,881 --> 02:39:46,387
MARISHA: Quickly? Efficiently?

2305
02:39:46,387 --> 02:39:47,767
WILL: You can go through trees?

2306
02:39:47,767 --> 02:39:48,948
MARISHA: I can.

2307
02:39:48,948 --> 02:39:51,196
SAM: Only trees she's seen and knows very well.

2308
02:39:51,196 --> 02:39:52,509
TRAVIS: But the Earthbreaker is here.

2309
02:39:52,509 --> 02:39:55,839
MARISHA: Luckily, all places that we are going,
we've been to.

2310
02:39:55,839 --> 02:40:01,789
LIAM: I mean, if we're spiraling out, right?
Earthbreaker's here, Ashari are close by, and then

2311
02:40:01,789 --> 02:40:04,175
we're talking about in and around Westruun.

2312
02:40:04,175 --> 02:40:06,272
LAURA: Yeah. So let's go to the Earthbreaker.

2313
02:40:06,272 --> 02:40:07,990
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to the Earthbreaker.

2314
02:40:07,990 --> 02:40:09,575
TALIESIN: Followed by the Ashari.

2315
02:40:09,575 --> 02:40:10,863
SAM: Followed by the airship.

2316
02:40:10,863 --> 02:40:12,448
TALIESIN: Followed by the airship.

2317
02:40:12,448 --> 02:40:21,177
MATT: "Earthbreaker. As in Dawn Marshal? The great
Dawn Marshal of--? (chuckles) I've only seen him

2318
02:40:21,177 --> 02:40:23,597
"from a distance. He's a rough-looking fella."

2319
02:40:23,597 --> 02:40:26,130
TRAVIS: Yeah, right. He's got a pair of arms on
him, doesn't he?

2320
02:40:26,130 --> 02:40:30,346
MATT: "I'm excited to see this." Puts it over her
shoulder and she's walking down, her little legs

2321
02:40:30,346 --> 02:40:32,804
(clanging) with her armor down the stairs.

2322
02:40:32,804 --> 02:40:37,192
TRAVIS: Hold up, Kima. Hold up. What do you mean?
Have you spoken with him before?

2323
02:40:37,192 --> 02:40:39,432
MATT: "I've seen him punch someone's head clear
off."

2324
02:40:39,432 --> 02:40:41,145
LAURA: Off of his body?

2325
02:40:41,145 --> 02:40:42,650
SAM: That is so cool.

2326
02:40:42,650 --> 02:40:44,242
WILL: You only turn them into paste.

2327
02:40:44,242 --> 02:40:47,181
LIAM: Level up.

2328
02:40:47,181 --> 02:40:48,400
TRAVIS: I'm excited.

2329
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:50,182
MARY: Oh! Oh dear.

2330
02:40:50,182 --> 02:40:55,539
MATT: (laughs) "You're not the only one!" And
she continues rushing ahead. You get the feeling

2331
02:40:55,539 --> 02:41:00,266
that Kima's been locked up and been doing temple
stuff for quite some time and is very happy to get

2332
02:41:00,266 --> 02:41:02,005
out of her general duties.

2333
02:41:02,005 --> 02:41:03,539
LIAM: Lead the way, shitkicker!

2334
02:41:03,539 --> 02:41:08,314
MATT: You guys head back down the outside of the
Heaven's Stair, making your way back to the

2335
02:41:08,314 --> 02:41:12,538
outside of the Trial Forge. You can still see now
it's middle of the afternoon, all the forges

2336
02:41:12,538 --> 02:41:17,409
throughout the town are in full steam. You see big
plumes of black smoke pouring out of the various

2337
02:41:17,409 --> 02:41:18,839
steelworks.

2338
02:41:18,839 --> 02:41:28,585
MARISHA: On our way there, I pace next to Kash.
So, do you-- have you met Kima?

2339
02:41:28,585 --> 02:41:29,784
WILL: No.

2340
02:41:29,784 --> 02:41:32,321
MARISHA: I get the feeling that you guys knew each
other.

2341
02:41:32,321 --> 02:41:36,271
WILL: No. Never met Kima in my life. She didn't
seem to like me very much, which is odd, because

2342
02:41:36,271 --> 02:41:41,333
everyone else seems to think I'm an amazing guy.
Vax and Vex, everyone telling me they love my

2343
02:41:41,333 --> 02:41:45,174
eyes, they love this-- I don't know, it's weird.
Bunch of your friends are just very weird.

2344
02:41:45,174 --> 02:41:50,663
MARISHA: You seem really put off by it. I didn't
know it was so--

2345
02:41:50,663 --> 02:41:56,519
WILL: I'm not used to being around people all the
time. I have one real friend, and that's Z. I'm

2346
02:41:56,519 --> 02:42:02,793
only with her because she saved my life. I'd do
anything for her. Everybody else is odd for me.

2347
02:42:02,793 --> 02:42:06,452
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel that.

2348
02:42:06,452 --> 02:42:13,321
WILL: There is one thing I wanted to say to you,
though, about our kiss. I'm very happy that it

2349
02:42:13,321 --> 02:42:19,128
happened. But I shouldn't have stolen it. And for
that, I apologize.

2350
02:42:19,128 --> 02:42:35,413
MARISHA: You don't need to apologize. I also don't
ever want to hurt anyone.

2351
02:42:35,413 --> 02:42:37,282
WILL: Of course.

2352
02:42:37,282 --> 02:42:39,849
MARISHA: Physically or emotionally.

2353
02:42:39,849 --> 02:42:41,512
WILL: Nor me.

2354
02:42:41,512 --> 02:42:43,681
MARISHA: Okay.

2355
02:42:43,681 --> 02:42:46,601
WILL: Well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.

2356
02:42:46,601 --> 02:42:53,700
(laughter)

2357
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:59,029
MATT: So as you guys approach the outside steps
leading up to the doors of the Trial Forge, you

2358
02:42:59,029 --> 02:43:06,228
can see the large rust red-colored monument,
Temple to Kord. Very rigid and very much a temple

2359
02:43:06,228 --> 02:43:13,790
built to withstand. It's a fortress more than a
temple. And you see above it still, across the lip

2360
02:43:13,790 --> 02:43:19,534
at the very top at the front walkway, a little bit
of the Kord statue, looking over the entirety of

2361
02:43:19,534 --> 02:43:22,036
this section of Vasselheim.

2362
02:43:22,036 --> 02:43:23,936
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

2363
02:43:23,936 --> 02:43:26,980
MATT: The doors are actually ajar, they're open.

2364
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:28,032
TRAVIS: Oh!

2365
02:43:28,032 --> 02:43:34,694
MATT: There are two Dawn Marshals there in their
armor with the colors of Kord. As you approach,

2366
02:43:34,694 --> 02:43:37,744
they step out of the way.

2367
02:43:37,744 --> 02:43:40,010
LAURA: Ooh.

2368
02:43:40,010 --> 02:43:50,786
TRAVIS: Yes, clearly my presence is recognized in
this great hall. Good day, good day.

2369
02:43:50,786 --> 02:43:56,067
(laughter)

2370
02:43:56,067 --> 02:43:59,596
TRAVIS: Wouldst thou care to follow me inside?

2371
02:43:59,596 --> 02:44:01,771
SAM: Let's do this.

2372
02:44:01,771 --> 02:44:03,782
LIAM: Verily, verily.

2373
02:44:03,782 --> 02:44:07,530
LAURA: Huzzah, I say, my Lord.

2374
02:44:07,530 --> 02:44:09,419
MARISHA: My liege.

2375
02:44:09,419 --> 02:44:12,922
MATT: As you walk in, the two Dawn Marshals that
are out there put their arms together and they

2376
02:44:12,922 --> 02:44:19,941
lower their head and bow. And as you enter, they
close the doors behind you guys. The doors slam

2377
02:44:19,941 --> 02:44:26,387
behind you and you feel the stone shift from the
impact of the thud. 25-, 30-foot-tall doors that

2378
02:44:26,387 --> 02:44:28,413
mark the front of this.

2379
02:44:28,413 --> 02:44:30,390
TRAVIS: It's all right. Pucker up, we're okay.

2380
02:44:30,390 --> 02:44:37,100
MATT: The echo of the stone slam down the long
hall. You can see there are large pillars that

2381
02:44:37,100 --> 02:44:43,125
mark the run to the central chamber. You've been
here before, and as you walk across the smooth,

2382
02:44:43,125 --> 02:44:51,369
very, very simple stonework ahead, you can see
there is the central portion. It's almost like a

2383
02:44:51,369 --> 02:44:56,783
giant cross, like both sides of the temple meet in
the center. And there is a circular dip in the

2384
02:44:56,783 --> 02:45:01,989
ground. Not really a pit, it's only about four
feet down. But it's filled with a coarse sand, and

2385
02:45:01,989 --> 02:45:08,341
as you guys walk up to that edge, each monk
acknowledging you as you pass quietly, you can

2386
02:45:08,341 --> 02:45:18,482
hear the gentle chanting in the distance of low,
rumbling Gregorian voices, (chanting). And there,

2387
02:45:18,482 --> 02:45:26,974
sitting in the center of this open circular sand
patch, is the Earthbreaker himself. He is sitting

2388
02:45:26,974 --> 02:45:33,957
there, legs crossed, arms resting at the edge of
his knees, eyes closed. You can see, even from

2389
02:45:33,957 --> 02:45:43,964
here for those who haven't seen him before, he
wears simple free-flowing pants of a dark reddish

2390
02:45:43,964 --> 02:45:51,117
color with a gold trim on the sides, but they're
tattered towards the bottom. He has a one-shoulder

2391
02:45:51,117 --> 02:45:57,483
wrap across the front there and these large prayer
beads that hang around his neck. His skin is very

2392
02:45:57,483 --> 02:46:05,493
dark and weathered by sun and training, and he is
probably the most muscular human being you have

2393
02:46:05,493 --> 02:46:15,419
seen for his proportional form, he is a human
being built for discipline and physical martial

2394
02:46:15,419 --> 02:46:21,589
training and battle. Older though, still you can
see his long grey beard that rests about middle to

2395
02:46:21,589 --> 02:46:27,687
his chest, the balding on the front a little bit,
the rest of his grey hair rests to his mid-back,

2396
02:46:27,687 --> 02:46:35,315
and he just sits there quietly in the center. The
rest of the monks have gathered up and begun to

2397
02:46:35,315 --> 02:46:36,910
form around the circle.

2398
02:46:36,910 --> 02:46:39,942
TRAVIS: How many monks, would you say?

2399
02:46:39,942 --> 02:46:43,028
MATT: Right now, about 15?

2400
02:46:43,028 --> 02:46:44,598
TRAVIS: One-five.

2401
02:46:44,598 --> 02:46:45,604
MATT: Yeah.

2402
02:46:45,604 --> 02:46:48,683
LAURA: Are they talking at all or are they all
super-quiet?

2403
02:46:48,683 --> 02:46:50,125
MATT: Super-quiet.

2404
02:46:50,125 --> 02:46:58,469
TRAVIS: I walk up to within 20 feet of
Earthbreaker Groon.

2405
02:46:58,469 --> 02:47:00,284
MATT: Okay, so you leap down into the sandpit?

2406
02:47:00,284 --> 02:47:01,252
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2407
02:47:01,252 --> 02:47:04,060
MATT: Okay, so, you guys on the side. Grog, you
leap off.

2408
02:47:04,060 --> 02:47:06,020
TRAVIS: How deep is it lowered?

2409
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:10,080
MATT: You don't know how deep it is, but it's,
it's not, it's hard sand, it's packed, so you just

2410
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:11,312
kind of--

2411
02:47:11,312 --> 02:47:13,171
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I meant the depression, is it
like a couple feet?

2412
02:47:13,171 --> 02:47:14,715
MATT: Right, the depression's like an inch.

2413
02:47:14,715 --> 02:47:16,030
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

2414
02:47:16,030 --> 02:47:18,299
MATT: Oh, you mean the depression into the actual
ground?

2415
02:47:18,299 --> 02:47:19,280
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2416
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:20,441
MATT: About four feet.

2417
02:47:20,441 --> 02:47:22,392
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Yeah. So.

2418
02:47:22,392 --> 02:47:23,785
MATT: So you vault into it in a bound.

2419
02:47:23,785 --> 02:47:25,274
TRAVIS: Does he move at all?

2420
02:47:25,274 --> 02:47:30,261
MATT: No. He's still facing a little bit away from
you in the far corner.

2421
02:47:30,261 --> 02:47:41,600
TRAVIS: I put my fist in my hand and I bow
slightly. Does he move at all?

2422
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:46,924
MATT: The silence is broken immediately by a low,
rumbling voice that seems to have no particular

2423
02:47:46,924 --> 02:47:55,292
source in the vicinity where you stand. It says,
"You come because your lands now harbor a terrible

2424
02:47:55,292 --> 02:48:03,952
"conflagration. How do you think Groon can assist?"
Still facing away from you.

2425
02:48:03,952 --> 02:48:08,387
TRAVIS: We have traveled near and far, great
Grood.

2426
02:48:08,387 --> 02:48:10,169
MARISHA: It's like Sesame Street.

2427
02:48:10,169 --> 02:48:17,239
TRAVIS: And we would like to request upon you a
moment of your time?

2428
02:48:17,239 --> 02:48:19,484
WILL: Why is he doing the talking? Why is he doing
the talking?

2429
02:48:19,484 --> 02:48:21,613
MATT: As most of you noticed this time, his name
is Groon.

2430
02:48:21,613 --> 02:48:23,898
(laughter)

2431
02:48:23,898 --> 02:48:31,417
MATT: At which point he stands up, and, you know,
would only come to about your sternum,

2432
02:48:31,417 --> 02:48:39,740
height-wise, but he's just this tense, every
muscle is seemingly, there's not an ounce of fat

2433
02:48:39,740 --> 02:48:40,889
on this body and--

2434
02:48:40,889 --> 02:48:42,058
TRAVIS: Like a protein shake.

2435
02:48:42,058 --> 02:48:43,230
MATT: Yeah.

2436
02:48:43,230 --> 02:48:44,424
SAM: Paleo.

2437
02:48:44,424 --> 02:48:53,779
MATT: Turns around towards you and says, "You
stray from the darkness that I warned you, but

2438
02:48:53,779 --> 02:49:01,848
"this current distraction is too great. Even your
blood is drawn to the flames of promise and power.

2439
02:49:01,848 --> 02:49:07,163
"This shall be a test to see if you will break
against the shadow."

2440
02:49:07,163 --> 02:49:11,056
SAM: What shall be a test?

2441
02:49:11,056 --> 02:49:12,412
LAURA: What's the test?

2442
02:49:12,412 --> 02:49:16,216
MATT: "I know many things, Grog Strongjaw."

2443
02:49:16,216 --> 02:49:18,606
TRAVIS: He said my full name.

2444
02:49:18,606 --> 02:49:24,291
MATT: "But such knowledge is earned, not given."

2445
02:49:24,291 --> 02:49:26,984
MARISHA: (whispers) Shit, you might have to fight
this motherfucker.

2446
02:49:26,984 --> 02:49:29,416
MATT: "Where do you find your strength?"

2447
02:49:29,416 --> 02:49:35,008
LIAM: (whispers) What's he talking about, Grog?

2448
02:49:35,008 --> 02:49:44,131
MATT: As you're thinking, in a blinding instant
you see a flash of movement and, like a dagger in

2449
02:49:44,131 --> 02:49:47,517
your stomach, his elbow is (impact sound).

2450
02:49:47,517 --> 02:49:49,279
(groaning)

2451
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:53,701
MATT: Moved three feet in an instant and has slammed you
right in the center of your abdomen. The breath

2452
02:49:53,701 --> 02:49:58,656
just escapes you as you fall back, unable to
really catch yourself, and just land flat on your

2453
02:49:58,656 --> 02:50:00,061
back in the sand.

2454
02:50:00,061 --> 02:50:02,151
TRAVIS: (wheezing sounds)

2455
02:50:02,151 --> 02:50:03,835
MARISHA: We're all hanging back.

2456
02:50:03,835 --> 02:50:05,781
MATT: Puts his arm down.

2457
02:50:05,781 --> 02:50:08,161
MARISHA: Just watching.

2458
02:50:08,161 --> 02:50:13,957
MATT: "Strongjaw. Where do you find your
strength?"

2459
02:50:13,957 --> 02:50:18,187
TRAVIS: In my anger.

2460
02:50:18,187 --> 02:50:29,096
MATT: "You walk between worlds. Weakness in mind
or weakness in conviction. What do you stand for?

2461
02:50:29,096 --> 02:50:36,944
"Where do you find your strength?" At which point,
as you're getting up, there's another blinding

2462
02:50:36,944 --> 02:50:41,627
flash for a second and your feet are left out from
under you. Go ahead and make an athletics check,

2463
02:50:41,627 --> 02:50:43,536
because you're now prepared for this one.

2464
02:50:43,536 --> 02:50:45,013
WILL: Jeez.

2465
02:50:45,013 --> 02:50:47,695
TALIESIN: Gonna get smackdown.

2466
02:50:47,695 --> 02:50:49,235
TRAVIS: 19.

2467
02:50:49,235 --> 02:50:56,005
MATT: Your feet go out from under you as you slam
onto your back, you just barely caught your breath

2468
02:50:56,005 --> 02:51:02,271
before it's almost knocked out again. He's looking
down at you this time, once again, his eyes just

2469
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:11,752
white. "Choose. Choose the two here who would save
you."

2470
02:51:11,752 --> 02:51:13,943
TRAVIS: (whispers) Pike's not here.

2471
02:51:13,943 --> 02:51:19,798
MATT: "Who would push you to your potential.
Choose your bloody muses."

2472
02:51:19,798 --> 02:51:22,663
SAM: Does he mean us, or?

2473
02:51:22,663 --> 02:51:24,584
TRAVIS: Do they have to be here?

2474
02:51:24,584 --> 02:51:30,500
MATT: He looks over to the rest of you on the side
of the pit. "Choose."

2475
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:37,298
TRAVIS: (sighs) I choose my buddy Pike.

2476
02:51:37,298 --> 02:51:39,485
SAM: She's not here.

2477
02:51:39,485 --> 02:51:54,010
TRAVIS: I don't care, I just say it anyway. I
choose Vax and I choose Scanlan.

2478
02:51:54,010 --> 02:51:58,462
SAM: We give him his strength, sir.

2479
02:51:58,462 --> 02:52:03,349
MATT: As you finish that sentence, two monks that
you failed to notice were behind you shove both of

2480
02:52:03,349 --> 02:52:09,012
you into the pit. Make acrobatics checks, both of
you guys.

2481
02:52:09,012 --> 02:52:18,664
SAM: (laughing nervously) Not my kind of fight!
Oh, I got a ten.

2482
02:52:18,664 --> 02:52:20,249
LIAM: 34.

2483
02:52:20,249 --> 02:52:21,262
MATT: Okay.

2484
02:52:21,262 --> 02:52:23,512
(laughter)

2485
02:52:23,512 --> 02:52:28,684
MATT: You tumble, catch Grog's arm, and lift him
onto his feet as you land yourself at his side.

2486
02:52:28,684 --> 02:52:32,659
Scanlan is face-down in the sand.

2487
02:52:32,659 --> 02:52:35,310
SAM: Are we talking still?

2488
02:52:35,310 --> 02:52:38,831
LIAM: I would just like to point out that I am
mostly sober.

2489
02:52:38,831 --> 02:52:44,956
MATT: Groon takes two steps back and just closes
his eyes and puts his arms at his sides.

2490
02:52:44,956 --> 02:52:50,828
"Now. Show me your conviction."

2491
02:52:50,828 --> 02:52:52,218
MARISHA: Oh snap!

2492
02:52:52,218 --> 02:52:53,672
MATT: I need you three to roll initiative.

2493
02:52:53,672 --> 02:52:57,219
ALL: Oh!

2494
02:52:57,219 --> 02:53:03,781
LIAM: Natural 20! 25 off a natural 20!

2495
02:53:03,781 --> 02:53:09,940
WILL: Oh snap! Shit's getting real.

2496
02:53:09,940 --> 02:53:16,506
MATT: The statues that're set at the edge of this,
we're gonna put you, Grog, there--

2497
02:53:16,506 --> 02:53:19,545
LAURA: Look at the coolness that's been created on
this map!

2498
02:53:19,545 --> 02:53:23,121
MATT: And boom.

2499
02:53:23,121 --> 02:53:27,395
LAURA: So cool! This is awesome, Matt!

2500
02:53:27,395 --> 02:53:29,364
MARY: Look how little they are!

2501
02:53:29,364 --> 02:53:32,901
MATT: I'll just move it this way a little bit,
just so you guys can see, there we go.

2502
02:53:32,901 --> 02:53:34,766
LIAM: I'm peeing just a little bit.

2503
02:53:34,766 --> 02:53:35,947
MARY: Oh my goodness.

2504
02:53:35,947 --> 02:53:37,413
LAURA: Hey you guys, don't die!

2505
02:53:37,413 --> 02:53:41,106
MATT: All right, so. Let me get Groon's sheet out
here.

2506
02:53:41,106 --> 02:53:43,111
SAM: Is it just us against one person?

2507
02:53:43,111 --> 02:53:44,305
TRAVIS: Yep.

2508
02:53:44,305 --> 02:53:45,508
LAURA: He's really strong.

2509
02:53:45,508 --> 02:53:47,580
MARISHA: He's gonna kick your guys's asses.

2510
02:53:47,580 --> 02:53:49,260
WILL: Can you see, do you want to switch seats so
you can see? Okay.

2511
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:52,310
SAM: No, I can see on the screen.

2512
02:53:52,310 --> 02:53:53,705
MATT: Okay, so. 25 to 20?

2513
02:53:53,705 --> 02:53:55,106
LIAM: 25 off a natural 20.

2514
02:53:55,106 --> 02:54:00,877
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

2515
02:54:00,877 --> 02:54:02,304
TRAVIS: 19.

2516
02:54:02,304 --> 02:54:03,922
SAM: 16.

2517
02:54:03,922 --> 02:54:11,629
MATT: 16, Scanlan. All right, perfect. First up's
first. You, Vax. Just standing with his arm up.

2518
02:54:11,629 --> 02:54:14,146
LIAM: Click my Boots of Haste.

2519
02:54:14,146 --> 02:54:16,299
(laughter)

2520
02:54:16,299 --> 02:54:19,310
MARY: Click 'em hard!

2521
02:54:19,310 --> 02:54:26,593
LIAM: And use my bonus action to hide behind
Grog's thigh and hold my turn.

2522
02:54:26,593 --> 02:54:28,804
MATT: Until what, what's your trigger?

2523
02:54:28,804 --> 02:54:32,201
LIAM: Until Grog moves towards the Earthbreaker.

2524
02:54:32,201 --> 02:54:33,654
MATT: Okay.

2525
02:54:33,654 --> 02:54:39,347
LIAM: When he does it I'm gonna go with him and
fight him if I can.

2526
02:54:39,347 --> 02:54:45,156
MATT: Well, your movement is in your turn, it's
your action you have to hold.

2527
02:54:45,156 --> 02:54:46,756
LIAM: Oh boy. Oh boy.

2528
02:54:46,756 --> 02:54:49,383
MATT: So. Are you gonna wait behind him?

2529
02:54:49,383 --> 02:54:51,507
LIAM: Well, let me just think for ten seconds
only.

2530
02:54:51,507 --> 02:54:52,791
MATT: Can't, you've got-- dude.

2531
02:54:52,791 --> 02:54:56,662
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so, I use my bonus action to
hide. Do I need to roll for that?

2532
02:54:56,662 --> 02:54:57,847
MATT: Yes, you do.

2533
02:54:57,847 --> 02:54:59,401
LIAM: Yeah. That's a--

2534
02:54:59,401 --> 02:55:00,458
LAURA: Ohh.

2535
02:55:00,458 --> 02:55:05,895
LIAM: No, that's fine, because remember, I'm me.
So that is, that's a 25.

2536
02:55:05,895 --> 02:55:07,075
MATT: Okay.

2537
02:55:07,075 --> 02:55:09,191
LIAM: I guess behind Grog.

2538
02:55:09,191 --> 02:55:10,738
MATT: He has no idea where you are.

2539
02:55:10,738 --> 02:55:12,854
LIAM: No, I'm going to throw fucking daggers at
this guy!

2540
02:55:12,854 --> 02:55:13,831
MATT: Go for it.

2541
02:55:13,831 --> 02:55:22,972
LIAM: Because I'm first. Oh my god. I am. First is
24?

2542
02:55:22,972 --> 02:55:24,752
MATT: 24 hits.

2543
02:55:24,752 --> 02:55:30,146
LIAM: And then, so I used my bonus action to hide,
which means I can do two, right? So the second is

2544
02:55:30,146 --> 02:55:31,444
not that great.

2545
02:55:31,444 --> 02:55:33,038
TRAVIS: I don't know what you're so worried
about.

2546
02:55:33,038 --> 02:55:36,497
LIAM: Using Luck. Better. Second is a 30.

2547
02:55:36,497 --> 02:55:38,259
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

2548
02:55:38,259 --> 02:55:45,289
LIAM: Okay, now. This is, I'm the first to attack,
which means that it is-- Ooh, it's a 19.

2549
02:55:45,289 --> 02:55:48,650
MATT: What's the range increment on this?

2550
02:55:48,650 --> 02:55:50,339
LIAM: I'm Sharpshooter, man.

2551
02:55:50,339 --> 02:55:51,790
MATT: Right, but what's the max range?

2552
02:55:51,790 --> 02:55:52,486
LIAM: 60.

2553
02:55:52,486 --> 02:55:54,712
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2554
02:55:54,712 --> 02:55:58,877
LIAM: Okay, so. I'm hidden behind Grog so it
should be sneak attack, and I'm the first to go so

2555
02:55:58,877 --> 02:56:00,382
it's a crit.

2556
02:56:00,382 --> 02:56:03,488
MATT: You're the first to go, it is a crit. It is
not a sneak attack.

2557
02:56:03,488 --> 02:56:06,443
LIAM: It's not a sneak attack? Even though I used
my bonus to hide behind Grog's big fat leg?

2558
02:56:06,443 --> 02:56:09,002
MATT: Where could you possibly be, Vax?

2559
02:56:09,002 --> 02:56:11,334
LIAM: He's huge! All right, okay.

2560
02:56:11,334 --> 02:56:15,072
MATT: Where could you have possibly hidden from
his sight in the middle of this giant open sandy arena?

2561
02:56:15,072 --> 02:56:16,440
WILL: He's disappeared!

2562
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:18,773
LIAM: I'm drunk and fighting in a pit!

2563
02:56:18,773 --> 02:56:22,174
MATT: It's okay. But it is double damage.

2564
02:56:22,174 --> 02:56:24,827
LIAM: All right, all right. So there is no sneak
attack, but it is crit, right? Because I'm the

2565
02:56:24,827 --> 02:56:26,025
first to attack?

2566
02:56:26,025 --> 02:56:26,958
LAURA: Yeah.

2567
02:56:26,958 --> 02:56:30,688
MATT: Well no, it's surprise, not the first to
attack. He is not surprised.

2568
02:56:30,688 --> 02:56:31,819
LIAM: He's not surprised.

2569
02:56:31,819 --> 02:56:34,034
MATT: No. It's not first, it's just surprised.

2570
02:56:34,034 --> 02:56:35,681
LIAM: Oh god. I'm drunk, tell me what's going on.

2571
02:56:35,681 --> 02:56:37,296
MATT: You hit him twice, roll damage.

2572
02:56:37,296 --> 02:56:39,090
MARISHA: I know, I'm so confused.

2573
02:56:39,090 --> 02:56:42,771
LIAM: One plus seven's eight, and then eight.
Eight and eight.

2574
02:56:42,771 --> 02:56:46,270
LAURA: (laughs) That's almost as good as all those
other things you did today.

2575
02:56:46,270 --> 02:56:49,179
MATT: The first one, he deflects with his hand and
it cuts the arm and you can see the little slash

2576
02:56:49,179 --> 02:56:53,735
of damage it dealt. The second one, he's gonna use
his reaction to do deflect missiles.

2577
02:56:53,735 --> 02:56:57,745
MARISHA: That's cool. That's some Bruce Lee shit.

2578
02:56:57,745 --> 02:57:03,768
MATT: (laughs) Yeah. He reduces the damage
entirely, spends one of his ki points, he catches

2579
02:57:03,768 --> 02:57:06,792
the dagger and throws it right back at you.

2580
02:57:06,792 --> 02:57:08,486
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna use Uncanny Dodge.

2581
02:57:08,486 --> 02:57:12,126
MATT: Not back at you, though. Because you're
currently behind Grog.

2582
02:57:12,126 --> 02:57:14,504
SAM: Hi!

2583
02:57:14,504 --> 02:57:17,046
(laughter)

2584
02:57:17,046 --> 02:57:19,394
LAURA: Are you still face-down in the sand?

2585
02:57:19,394 --> 02:57:21,431
SAM: What's going on?

2586
02:57:21,431 --> 02:57:24,836
MATT: That's 18 to hit.

2587
02:57:24,836 --> 02:57:26,169
SAM: That hits.

2588
02:57:26,169 --> 02:57:36,735
MATT: Okay. So you take 12 points of piercing
damage. As he chucks Vax's dagger back at you, it

2589
02:57:36,735 --> 02:57:40,937
sinks into your shoulder suddenly before it
vanishes and returns to your belt.

2590
02:57:40,937 --> 02:57:42,553
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry.

2591
02:57:42,553 --> 02:57:45,535
SAM: All I've heard was "Scanlan.'"

2592
02:57:45,535 --> 02:57:49,238
(laughter)

2593
02:57:49,238 --> 02:57:51,145
SAM: "My buddy Scanlan."

2594
02:57:51,145 --> 02:57:54,460
MARISHA: (laughs) That's true, that is all you
heard.

2595
02:57:54,460 --> 02:57:57,089
MATT: All right. Now it is Groon's turn.

2596
02:57:57,089 --> 02:58:04,727
Groon is going to rush up to the front of
Grog-- actually no, to the side here so you're

2597
02:58:04,727 --> 02:58:11,970
both in combat, technically, and is going to make
a flurry of blows attack using another one of his

2598
02:58:11,970 --> 02:58:19,683
ki points. So that's gonna be four attacks, all
against you, Grog.

2599
02:58:19,683 --> 02:58:21,217
TRAVIS: Okay.

2600
02:58:21,217 --> 02:58:29,043
MATT: So that's a 27, hits, I'm pretty sure.
Cocked. 26.

2601
02:58:29,043 --> 02:58:30,293
TRAVIS: (laughing) 27 and 26?

2602
02:58:30,293 --> 02:58:31,837
MATT: 16?

2603
02:58:31,837 --> 02:58:33,205
TRAVIS: Oh, it misses!

2604
02:58:33,205 --> 02:58:35,814
(laughter)

2605
02:58:35,814 --> 02:58:36,794
MATT: And 28.

2606
02:58:36,794 --> 02:58:37,966
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits too.

2607
02:58:37,966 --> 02:58:40,751
MARISHA: What the fuck is this guy's base? What?

2608
02:58:40,751 --> 02:58:42,677
WILL: This is when you want to be fighting Wil
Wheaton.

2609
02:58:42,677 --> 02:58:45,141
(laughter)

2610
02:58:45,141 --> 02:58:48,780
MATT: Okay, you take--

2611
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:52,706
TALIESIN: He's doing a lot of math.

2612
02:58:52,706 --> 02:58:59,602
MATT: 31 points of bludgeoning damage. And his
kick just-- whack!-- right across the jaw. You

2613
02:58:59,602 --> 02:59:07,643
haven't even raged yet, and the pain is intense,
your vision goes white for a second. And go ahead

2614
02:59:07,643 --> 02:59:09,473
and make a dex saving throw.

2615
02:59:09,473 --> 02:59:11,821
LAURA: Oh man!

2616
02:59:11,821 --> 02:59:13,465
TRAVIS: Seven.

2617
02:59:13,465 --> 02:59:16,940
MATT: As his fourth action, sweeps your feet out
from under you and you are knocked

2618
02:59:16,940 --> 02:59:18,197
prone on the ground.

2619
02:59:18,197 --> 02:59:21,040
MARISHA: Oh, shit. This guy's a badass.

2620
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:22,904
LAURA: He gets four actions?

2621
02:59:22,904 --> 02:59:24,396
MARISHA: Monks, man.

2622
02:59:24,396 --> 02:59:26,396
MATT: That's his turn. Grog, you're up now.

2623
02:59:26,396 --> 02:59:27,691
WILL: And we can't do anything?

2624
02:59:27,691 --> 02:59:30,474
TALIESIN: Well, if you want to get involved.

2625
02:59:30,474 --> 02:59:36,931
TRAVIS: (panting) I. Would like. To rage. I'd like
to stand up, please.

2626
02:59:36,931 --> 02:59:39,453
(laughter)

2627
02:59:39,453 --> 02:59:43,426
TRAVIS: Do I have to roll for that?

2628
02:59:43,426 --> 02:59:45,574
MATT: No no no, you just use half your movement
for that.

2629
02:59:45,574 --> 02:59:51,744
TRAVIS: I take out Craven Edge, and I'd like to
swing twice against him.

2630
02:59:51,744 --> 02:59:53,066
MATT: Go for it.

2631
02:59:53,066 --> 02:59:57,748
TRAVIS: That's a 25?

2632
02:59:57,748 --> 02:59:59,169
MATT: 25 hits.

2633
02:59:59,169 --> 03:00:01,484
TRAVIS: 25 hits, that's good. And a 17.

2634
03:00:01,484 --> 03:00:02,518
MATT: Misses.

2635
03:00:02,518 --> 03:00:09,949
TRAVIS: Misses. 18. 21 points of damage.

2636
03:00:09,949 --> 03:00:12,284
MATT: 21 points of damage. All righty.

2637
03:00:12,284 --> 03:00:14,159
TRAVIS: And roll for the DC.

2638
03:00:14,159 --> 03:00:15,535
MATT: Yeah, he makes it.

2639
03:00:15,535 --> 03:00:16,857
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

2640
03:00:16,857 --> 03:00:21,487
MATT: (laughs) Sorry. All right, so.

2641
03:00:21,487 --> 03:00:23,384
TRAVIS: Can I move, or is getting up my movement?

2642
03:00:23,384 --> 03:00:24,521
MATT: You can move, yeah.

2643
03:00:24,521 --> 03:00:27,474
TRAVIS: I want to move around, just stay right
next to him, but move around behind him.

2644
03:00:27,474 --> 03:00:28,545
MATT: Right there, you mean?

2645
03:00:28,545 --> 03:00:29,444
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2646
03:00:29,444 --> 03:00:34,574
MATT: Vax is there, then that would be your
flanking potential there. Okay. Cool. That ends

2647
03:00:34,574 --> 03:00:36,196
your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

2648
03:00:36,196 --> 03:00:40,165
SAM: Did Grog moving activate Vax? Didn't you hold
your turn or something?

2649
03:00:40,165 --> 03:00:41,525
LAURA: No, he didn't.

2650
03:00:41,525 --> 03:00:43,042
WILL: He chucked knives.

2651
03:00:43,042 --> 03:00:51,512
SAM: I'll stand up out of the sand. And I
will, eeeee, I will--

2652
03:00:51,512 --> 03:00:53,395
(laughter)

2653
03:00:53,395 --> 03:00:56,235
SAM: I will look extremely weak and I will sing a
song to him.

2654
03:00:56,235 --> 03:00:59,374
(laughter)

2655
03:00:59,374 --> 03:01:06,935
SAM: I will attempt to cast, with the horn,
Eyebite on him, and I'll sing, (singing) My my my,

2656
03:01:06,935 --> 03:01:08,837
eye bitten twice shy.

2657
03:01:08,837 --> 03:01:11,211
(laughter)

2658
03:01:11,211 --> 03:01:17,706
WILL: Wow. Best fight ever.

2659
03:01:17,706 --> 03:01:26,219
MATT: All righty, and that is Eyebite. All right,
so it's a-- you said wisdom save?

2660
03:01:26,219 --> 03:01:27,853
SAM: It's a wisdom save.

2661
03:01:27,853 --> 03:01:30,031
MATT: All right. What's the DC?

2662
03:01:30,031 --> 03:01:31,436
SAM: It's 19.

2663
03:01:31,436 --> 03:01:33,778
MATT: No, he fails it. So what are you doing?

2664
03:01:33,778 --> 03:01:42,782
SAM: This is a good question. I don't know what to
do. Should I make him fall asleep? I think no.

2665
03:01:42,782 --> 03:01:46,386
Because we want this fight to continue, that would
sort of end it, won't it?

2666
03:01:46,386 --> 03:01:51,474
LAURA: Do whatever you want, I dunno.

2667
03:01:51,474 --> 03:01:52,750
WILL: That's a great look.

2668
03:01:52,750 --> 03:01:53,869
TALIESIN: Do something funny.

2669
03:01:53,869 --> 03:01:55,837
SAM: Yeah, I want him to go to sleep in the sand.

2670
03:01:55,892 --> 03:01:57,045
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

2671
03:01:57,045 --> 03:01:58,521
SAM: Just curl up in the fetal position.

2672
03:01:58,521 --> 03:02:03,250
MATT: Okay. Okay, what happens is, as soon as you
move around, Grog, and you sing at him? He glances

2673
03:02:03,250 --> 03:02:07,981
over at you for a second and his eyes roll back
and he (impact sound) and just falls back in the

2674
03:02:07,981 --> 03:02:09,573
sand, unconscious.

2675
03:02:09,573 --> 03:02:11,075
LIAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

2676
03:02:11,075 --> 03:02:12,507
MARY: Ladies and gentlemen.

2677
03:02:12,507 --> 03:02:13,747
SAM: That was a quick fight.

2678
03:02:13,747 --> 03:02:18,913
MATT: At which point, all the monks currently are
gasping in immediate reaction.

2679
03:02:18,913 --> 03:02:21,255
(laughter)

2680
03:02:21,255 --> 03:02:26,517
MATT: As he's currently unconscious and affected
by Eyebite. All right, do you want to move or are

2681
03:02:26,517 --> 03:02:28,370
you staying where you are on your turn? Bonus
action?

2682
03:02:28,370 --> 03:02:33,658
SAM: I mean, he can't swipe at me if I walk away,
so I'm gonna get away from him. Although he can

2683
03:02:33,658 --> 03:02:36,794
move super fast. I'll walk a little bit away.

2684
03:02:36,794 --> 03:02:39,138
TRAVIS: Now in the middle of the room.

2685
03:02:39,138 --> 03:02:43,905
SAM: And I'll inspire Grog, in case this fight
continues, and I will sing--

2686
03:02:43,905 --> 03:02:48,067
MATT: Actually, you know what? No, go ahead. I
forgot to read something. Go ahead. My own fault.

2687
03:02:48,067 --> 03:02:59,434
SAM: I will sing: (singing) Hail to the goliaths,
hail victory, blood on the warpath, fight for Vax

2688
03:02:59,434 --> 03:03:00,534
and me.

2689
03:03:00,534 --> 03:03:03,079
(laughter)

2690
03:03:03,079 --> 03:03:04,488
TRAVIS: That's the best.

2691
03:03:04,488 --> 03:03:05,692
MATT: Take your d10.

2692
03:03:05,692 --> 03:03:10,040
SAM: (whispers) That's the Redskins' fight song.

2693
03:03:10,040 --> 03:03:19,202
(yelling)

2694
03:03:19,202 --> 03:03:21,857
LIAM: That is amazing!

2695
03:03:21,857 --> 03:03:25,994
TALIESIN: Thank you, that was genius.

2696
03:03:25,994 --> 03:03:28,102
TRAVIS: I ain't using it.

2697
03:03:28,102 --> 03:03:31,755
(yelling)

2698
03:03:31,755 --> 03:03:33,634
MARY: As the worlds collide.

2699
03:03:33,634 --> 03:03:35,387
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. Vax, you're up.

2700
03:03:35,387 --> 03:03:38,569
LIAM: Grog, Grog, Grog, do we really want to do
this? He's down, he's asleep!

2701
03:03:38,569 --> 03:03:39,754
SAM: What do we do?

2702
03:03:39,754 --> 03:03:42,767
LIAM: Are we doing this, are we really doing this?
He's asleep.

2703
03:03:42,767 --> 03:03:45,152
TRAVIS: What, like, so if we hit him, does he wake
up?

2704
03:03:45,152 --> 03:03:47,510
SAM: He will, but you get, you'll get a few licks
in.

2705
03:03:47,510 --> 03:03:50,318
LIAM: We're not trying to kill him, we want him to
work with us.

2706
03:03:50,318 --> 03:03:53,220
TRAVIS: You fucking end him and you end him now.

2707
03:03:53,220 --> 03:03:54,524
SAM: Yeah, kill him.

2708
03:03:54,524 --> 03:03:59,335
LIAM: Excuse me? All right, so, I use disen-- no,
I don't have to.

2709
03:03:59,335 --> 03:04:00,792
SAM: No, he's asleep.

2710
03:04:00,792 --> 03:04:05,367
LIAM: Yeah, okay. So I got two daggers in my
hands, and they spin around in my hand, and I just

2711
03:04:05,367 --> 03:04:06,856
start beating him in the head.

2712
03:04:06,856 --> 03:04:08,048
MATT: All right, go for it.

2713
03:04:08,048 --> 03:04:09,555
SAM: I assume this is a sneak attack since he
can't see it.

2714
03:04:09,555 --> 03:04:11,044
LIAM: Yes, it is, because Grog's right there.

2715
03:04:11,044 --> 03:04:14,522
SAM: He will wake up after this.

2716
03:04:14,522 --> 03:04:15,648
LIAM: 21.

2717
03:04:15,648 --> 03:04:17,795
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he might not hit him anyway, he
rolls for it.

2718
03:04:17,795 --> 03:04:19,102
SAM: I don't know, actually.

2719
03:04:19,102 --> 03:04:22,264
MATT: As you go and attempt to strike him-- You
had advantage on the attacks, by the way, because

2720
03:04:22,264 --> 03:04:23,490
he's on the ground.

2721
03:04:23,490 --> 03:04:27,105
LIAM: Oh, well then it is a 32.

2722
03:04:27,105 --> 03:04:28,894
MATT: Okay. Good. That hits.

2723
03:04:28,894 --> 03:04:34,321
LIAM: And then the second one is a 27 and the
third one is a 17.

2724
03:04:34,321 --> 03:04:35,833
MATT: First two hit.

2725
03:04:35,833 --> 03:04:39,083
LIAM: First two hit, and the first one is sneak
attack with the blunt edge.

2726
03:04:39,083 --> 03:04:41,739
MATT: Right. Which is doubled because he's
unconscious.

2727
03:04:41,739 --> 03:04:42,733
LIAM: Yeah it is.

2728
03:04:42,733 --> 03:04:44,192
MATT: Melee attack within five feet.

2729
03:04:44,192 --> 03:05:02,487
LIAM: Oh, I'm so sorry! Nine. Plus-- Whoa. That is
ten, 16, 22, 23, 25, is 50? Plus the-- 59. 59 for

2730
03:05:02,487 --> 03:05:03,659
the first.

2731
03:05:03,659 --> 03:05:04,989
MATT: 59. Hoo.

2732
03:05:04,989 --> 03:05:09,003
LIAM: Ooh, that's the wrong one. And then the
second dagger does ten.

2733
03:05:09,003 --> 03:05:15,377
MATT: Ten. So as you-- whack!-- hit him in the
head, he immediately comes back to consciousness.

2734
03:05:15,377 --> 03:05:21,443
LIAM: And I'm gonna use my movement to run around
and to roll around behind Grog's buttocks.

2735
03:05:21,443 --> 03:05:33,364
MATT: Okay. As you move aside, even on the ground,
prone, he swings his leg out to try and catch you

2736
03:05:33,364 --> 03:05:34,790
as you're running past.

2737
03:05:34,790 --> 03:05:35,985
LIAM: Acrobatics?

2738
03:05:35,985 --> 03:05:39,127
MATT: He has disadvantage on this anyway. That is
still a 24 to hit.

2739
03:05:39,127 --> 03:05:42,621
LIAM: To hit? Oh, that's an attack. Even though he
was unconscious?

2740
03:05:42,621 --> 03:05:47,740
MATT: Well, he woke up after you slammed him,
second attack hits, and in reaction as he sees you

2741
03:05:47,740 --> 03:05:50,935
rush off, he kicks his leg up and manages to catch
you.

2742
03:05:50,935 --> 03:05:52,194
LIAM: Yeah, I'm feeling that.

2743
03:05:52,194 --> 03:05:54,125
MATT: It doesn't manage to trip you, but it does
deal--

2744
03:05:54,125 --> 03:05:55,208
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

2745
03:05:55,208 --> 03:06:00,689
MATT: So you deal half the damage on that. All
right. So you take-- What would be 12 points of

2746
03:06:00,689 --> 03:06:02,975
damage, you take six points of bludgeoning
damage.

2747
03:06:02,975 --> 03:06:04,732
LIAM: Ah, fucking ankle. Come on.

2748
03:06:04,732 --> 03:06:06,174
WILL: It was still uncanny.

2749
03:06:06,174 --> 03:06:08,568
MATT: It was quite uncanny. All right, that ends
your turn?

2750
03:06:08,568 --> 03:06:09,618
LIAM: Yes.

2751
03:06:09,618 --> 03:06:14,810
MATT: All right. It's now his turn. All right,
so.

2752
03:06:14,810 --> 03:06:18,810
LIAM: I'm so acrobatic.

2753
03:06:18,810 --> 03:06:25,311
TRAVIS: We're waiting to see if he's awake or
not.

2754
03:06:25,311 --> 03:06:28,502
MATT: So yeah, until the spell ends, you can use
your action every turn to try and give him another

2755
03:06:28,502 --> 03:06:31,673
effect if you wanted to, Scanlan. So he still has
Eyebite, but he's conscious.

2756
03:06:31,673 --> 03:06:34,569
SAM: Can I change the effect, or does it always
have to be--

2757
03:06:34,569 --> 03:06:36,491
MATT: You can if you want to, when it comes to
your next turn, but it has to be on your turn to

2758
03:06:36,491 --> 03:06:44,026
use your action to do it. He gets up using half
his movement. Which is fine. He's going to, as he

2759
03:06:44,026 --> 03:06:48,970
looks over and you can see him glance to the side
of Grog and see where you are, as the giant crack

2760
03:06:48,970 --> 03:06:53,403
in the side of his head and the blood that's
trickling down the side of his face, he just

2761
03:06:53,403 --> 03:06:56,903
rushes around, still in melee with you so he
doesn't get an attack of opportunity, and he's

2762
03:06:56,903 --> 03:07:07,116
gonna go unarmed attacks on you for three. Natural
20. That's a 17.

2763
03:07:07,116 --> 03:07:09,370
LIAM: No.

2764
03:07:09,370 --> 03:07:13,121
MATT: With your haste, yeah, you get a bonus, so
that's a miss. And that is a 25.

2765
03:07:13,121 --> 03:07:14,851
LIAM: That hits. Two of those hit.

2766
03:07:14,851 --> 03:07:25,432
MATT: All right. So the crit, 28 points of
bludgeoning damage. And the last one is gonna be

2767
03:07:25,432 --> 03:07:41,503
14 points of bludgeoning damage. And he's going to
use three ki points. As he comes around, elbows

2768
03:07:41,503 --> 03:07:45,265
you to the side of the face, you just weren't
expecting it and it cracks you and you feel like a

2769
03:07:45,265 --> 03:07:49,489
tooth crack and the pain sears through your jaw
and you're like, ugh! And then he brings his lower

2770
03:07:49,489 --> 03:07:54,529
hand and (impact) hits you right in the center of
the abdomen, and it hits you, and it hurts, but

2771
03:07:54,529 --> 03:07:59,153
it's not as impactful as you thought it would be
for the force, but you feel like this strange,

2772
03:07:59,153 --> 03:08:02,747
like, quivering vibration in your midsection, like
almost like the muscles are spasming

2773
03:08:02,747 --> 03:08:11,255
uncontrollably and you don't quite understand why.
That is going to end his turn. Grog, you're up.

2774
03:08:11,255 --> 03:08:18,256
TRAVIS: No! And I go into a frenzied rage. If it's
gonna be an ass-beating we take, we might as well

2775
03:08:18,256 --> 03:08:23,324
just get on with it. And I'll use reckless attack
and Great Weapon Master against him.

2776
03:08:23,324 --> 03:08:24,808
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2777
03:08:24,808 --> 03:08:28,458
TRAVIS: Which means he gets advantage on
everything against me, but fuck it, he's hitting

2778
03:08:28,458 --> 03:08:33,966
anyway. Oh, 19, so close. 28.

2779
03:08:33,966 --> 03:08:35,164
MATT: 28 hits.

2780
03:08:35,164 --> 03:08:38,286
TRAVIS: 23?

2781
03:08:38,286 --> 03:08:39,764
MATT: 23 hits.

2782
03:08:39,764 --> 03:08:43,476
TRAVIS: 16.

2783
03:08:43,476 --> 03:08:44,612
MATT: Misses.

2784
03:08:44,612 --> 03:08:47,223
TRAVIS: Damn it. Those were high. Okay.

2785
03:08:47,223 --> 03:08:52,175
LAURA: You could've used your inspiration.

2786
03:08:52,175 --> 03:08:54,273
SAM: It's true.

2787
03:08:54,273 --> 03:08:56,781
TRAVIS: I'm not listening to any of you.

2788
03:08:56,781 --> 03:08:59,102
(laughter)

2789
03:08:59,102 --> 03:09:00,989
TRAVIS: 32 on the first one.

2790
03:09:00,989 --> 03:09:02,008
MATT: Nice.

2791
03:09:02,008 --> 03:09:04,980
WILL: That's hysterical. RG3 could've helped.

2792
03:09:04,980 --> 03:09:09,813
TRAVIS: Four, nine, 17, 27 on the second one, and
the third one missed.

2793
03:09:09,813 --> 03:09:14,673
MATT: Third missed, all right. Succeeds on the
first save with an 18-- and a 19, yeah. Saves both

2794
03:09:14,673 --> 03:09:21,213
hits from Craven Edge. As you slam the blade into
him twice, he's trying to parry them, and he's

2795
03:09:21,213 --> 03:09:25,022
catching the blade off to the side, but the
strength is too strong and you end up jamming it

2796
03:09:25,022 --> 03:09:30,973
into his forearm. As you pull away, the blood
streaks out. Each hit, he's still focused on you,

2797
03:09:30,973 --> 03:09:34,777
and he's not showing any pain, he's not grimacing.
You're just seeing the wounds being had and he's

2798
03:09:34,777 --> 03:09:37,775
just still intent on moving and his expression
focused on you.

2799
03:09:37,775 --> 03:09:40,358
TRAVIS: He made both those checks okay?

2800
03:09:40,358 --> 03:09:48,170
MATT: Yeah. And at that moment he looks at you and
says, "You carry such a dark weapon with you."

2801
03:09:48,170 --> 03:09:51,382
That's all he says. Is that the end of your turn?

2802
03:09:51,382 --> 03:09:53,517
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2803
03:09:53,517 --> 03:09:54,894
MATT: All right. Scanlan.

2804
03:09:54,894 --> 03:09:57,189
SAM: He's still eyebitten.

2805
03:09:57,189 --> 03:10:02,252
MATT: Correct, yes. Actually, let's see, he has to
save at the end of his turn. Which, he rolled a

2806
03:10:02,252 --> 03:10:03,378
one, so no.

2807
03:10:03,378 --> 03:10:12,732
SAM: All right. Instead of sleeping this time, I
would like him to just get sick. Be sick. I want

2808
03:10:12,732 --> 03:10:14,523
him to be sick now.

2809
03:10:14,523 --> 03:10:16,075
MARY: What kind of sick?

2810
03:10:16,075 --> 03:10:17,856
LAURA: Like, pukey or like the other one?

2811
03:10:17,856 --> 03:10:21,385
SAM: Oh, he has like diarrhea.

2812
03:10:21,385 --> 03:10:23,742
MARISHA: That's the worst.

2813
03:10:23,742 --> 03:10:29,786
LAURA: Oh man. That's so embarrassing.

2814
03:10:29,786 --> 03:10:38,106
MATT: All righty. Yeah. As you keep focusing, you
can see his form shifts a little bit, and you

2815
03:10:38,106 --> 03:10:42,373
swear you hear the cramping of someone's
abdominals in the distance, like an unhappy

2816
03:10:42,373 --> 03:10:43,501
digestive tract.

2817
03:10:43,501 --> 03:10:45,328
SAM: You didn't sleep well, did you? No?

2818
03:10:45,328 --> 03:10:49,169
LIAM: Like a tree cracking in the wind from this
guy.

2819
03:10:49,169 --> 03:10:57,912
SAM: And I will turn to Vax this time and inspire
him, and I will say, (singing) Kill that monk-y

2820
03:10:57,912 --> 03:11:08,110
douchebag, white boy. Kill that monk-y douchebag
right. Take out your daggers and kill that monk-y

2821
03:11:08,110 --> 03:11:09,806
douchebag 'til he dies.

2822
03:11:09,806 --> 03:11:12,252
(laughter)

2823
03:11:12,252 --> 03:11:14,369
MATT: Take your d10 inspiration.

2824
03:11:14,369 --> 03:11:16,255
LIAM: Okay, got it, got it, got it.

2825
03:11:16,255 --> 03:11:20,317
MATT: All right, that brings us to the top. Is that the
end of your turn, are you gonna move or anything else--

2826
03:11:20,317 --> 03:11:22,843
SAM: I'll move a little further away, it won't
really help.

2827
03:11:22,843 --> 03:11:24,655
MATT: All right. You're up.

2828
03:11:24,655 --> 03:11:26,430
LIAM: He's still pressed up against Grog, right?

2829
03:11:26,430 --> 03:11:27,420
MATT: Correct.

2830
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:32,949
LIAM: All right, I'm gonna use disengage and pivot
around Grog, right, run all around the circle and

2831
03:11:32,949 --> 03:11:34,475
get behind Scanlan.

2832
03:11:34,475 --> 03:11:37,641
SAM: Oh shit. I was trying to get away from him!

2833
03:11:37,641 --> 03:11:38,804
MATT: Like that?

2834
03:11:38,804 --> 03:11:48,119
LIAM: Yeah. And I'm gonna throw two daggers at
him, yeah. The first one's, okay, natural 20!

2835
03:11:48,119 --> 03:11:51,876
Wait, it's natural 20 on top of a sneak attack,
what happens?

2836
03:11:51,876 --> 03:11:54,770
MATT: Yeah, you double the sneak-attack damage.

2837
03:11:54,770 --> 03:11:56,911
LIAM: You double the sneak-attack?

2838
03:11:56,911 --> 03:12:00,425
MATT: It's a critical hit, all the dice you roll
for a critical hit you double.

2839
03:12:00,425 --> 03:12:02,089
TRAVIS: Picked you for a reason, add that shit up,
man.

2840
03:12:02,089 --> 03:12:04,019
MATT: And then you add the ability modifier at the
end. So yes.

2841
03:12:04,019 --> 03:12:05,379
LIAM: Let me take a moment.

2842
03:12:05,379 --> 03:12:07,422
(laughter)

2843
03:12:07,422 --> 03:12:09,143
MATT: Rogues, baby.

2844
03:12:09,143 --> 03:12:13,421
MARISHA: Get the blood back in your head.

2845
03:12:13,421 --> 03:12:18,621
LIAM: Okay, that's a nine. Okay. Think I want to
savor this.

2846
03:12:18,621 --> 03:12:20,723
WILL: He looks giddy, he looks giddy, it's great.

2847
03:12:20,723 --> 03:12:23,803
LIAM: All right. So. Oh my god. (counting)

2848
03:12:23,803 --> 03:12:30,900
TRAVIS: It's so juicy, so savory.

2849
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:33,688
LIAM: 23 doubled, quadrupled--

2850
03:12:33,688 --> 03:12:36,191
MATT: Not quadrupled. Doubled.

2851
03:12:36,191 --> 03:12:37,475
LIAM: 23. 28.

2852
03:12:37,475 --> 03:12:40,176
MATT: It's doubled, not quadrupled.

2853
03:12:40,176 --> 03:12:44,109
LIAM: Not quadrupled, oh! So sneak attack is not
doubled, then on top-- All right.

2854
03:12:44,109 --> 03:12:48,512
MARISHA: But that's what you said. That's not what
you said!

2855
03:12:48,512 --> 03:12:49,774
MATT: It's not a surprise attack.

2856
03:12:49,774 --> 03:12:50,692
LIAM: So it doesn't stack.

2857
03:12:50,692 --> 03:12:51,692
MATT: No.

2858
03:12:51,692 --> 03:12:53,215
LIAM: Yeah, but he's, he's up against Grog. So I
get--

2859
03:12:53,215 --> 03:12:54,893
MATT: Which is meaning you get sneak attack. So
you're doing sneak-attack damage on him, you

2860
03:12:54,893 --> 03:12:56,353
critically hit, so you just double your sneak
attack damage.

2861
03:12:56,353 --> 03:12:57,962
SAM: Just take your 80 points of damage, not your
160 points.

2862
03:12:57,962 --> 03:12:59,238
LIAM: So I double sneak-attack damage.

2863
03:12:59,238 --> 03:13:00,801
MATT: Yeah. You said quadruple, it's not
quadruple, it's just times two.

2864
03:13:00,801 --> 03:13:02,394
LIAM: 23, the sneak-attack damage is--

2865
03:13:02,394 --> 03:13:04,007
LAURA: That's 28. Times two.

2866
03:13:04,007 --> 03:13:06,562
LIAM: 56. All right. Yeah.

2867
03:13:06,562 --> 03:13:09,668
MARY: That's good, there's no disappointment
there.

2868
03:13:09,668 --> 03:13:12,503
TALIESIN: And now you add your knife.

2869
03:13:12,503 --> 03:13:14,110
LIAM: 68.

2870
03:13:14,110 --> 03:13:19,009
MATT: Oh, total of 68? Gotcha.

2871
03:13:19,009 --> 03:13:22,844
LIAM: Critical hit on a sneak attack. Got it, got
it, got it.

2872
03:13:22,844 --> 03:13:25,662
MATT: He is going to use a ki point to deflect
missiles.

2873
03:13:25,662 --> 03:13:30,531
LIAM: I'm gonna use my last bit of Luck so that he
has to roll again.

2874
03:13:30,531 --> 03:13:37,833
MATT: Okay. All right. It's not an attack roll on
this yet, just so you're aware.

2875
03:13:37,833 --> 03:13:38,994
LIAM: Okay.

2876
03:13:38,994 --> 03:13:40,813
MATT: This is him just reducing the damage he
takes from it.

2877
03:13:40,813 --> 03:13:41,904
LIAM: Oh, all right.

2878
03:13:41,904 --> 03:13:47,615
MATT: So that is a total of, he reduces the damage
by 13, he still takes the impact, but he manages

2879
03:13:47,615 --> 03:13:52,691
to slow the blade with his hands before it finds
itself in his chest and he rips it out, you can

2880
03:13:52,691 --> 03:13:57,697
see the spray of blood that hits in the sand
across the front before the dagger disappears from

2881
03:13:57,697 --> 03:13:58,705
his grip.

2882
03:13:58,705 --> 03:14:00,204
LIAM: And I duck behind Scanlan.

2883
03:14:00,204 --> 03:14:01,245
MATT: All right.

2884
03:14:01,245 --> 03:14:03,899
SAM: Don't hide behind me!

2885
03:14:03,899 --> 03:14:11,504
LIAM: Yeah, sure. It's, that was a four, ten.

2886
03:14:11,504 --> 03:14:12,984
MATT: Nope. This one--

2887
03:14:12,984 --> 03:14:19,393
LIAM: No, I rolled, I rolled a bunch of times.
Didn't I roll a bunch of times? Okay, all right,

2888
03:14:19,393 --> 03:14:21,178
well. She rolled a 20.

2889
03:14:21,178 --> 03:14:22,937
MATT: For nothing.

2890
03:14:22,937 --> 03:14:25,293
LIAM: I rolled a, oh that did fine. It's a 27.

2891
03:14:25,293 --> 03:14:30,145
MATT: Wait, so you did a total of 60-something
damage on him from the one attack?

2892
03:14:30,145 --> 03:14:31,184
LAURA: Yeah.

2893
03:14:31,184 --> 03:14:32,419
MATT: Yeah, got you, yes, the second one does--

2894
03:14:32,419 --> 03:14:33,333
LIAM: Second one is ten.

2895
03:14:33,333 --> 03:14:35,833
MATT: Yeah. So the second one attack hits. Go
ahead and roll for it. Or roll for damage.

2896
03:14:35,833 --> 03:14:37,832
LIAM: Nine.

2897
03:14:37,832 --> 03:14:42,127
MATT: Nine, okay. Cool. Cool.

2898
03:14:42,127 --> 03:14:45,692
LIAM: I'm scared to death, which is why the math
is so bad.

2899
03:14:45,692 --> 03:14:53,011
MATT: That's good. Well, as it comes back to
Groon's turn, Groon, you can see the blood is just

2900
03:14:53,011 --> 03:14:56,995
pouring out of the wound that you left, he takes
one hand and just (impact sound) slams it really

2901
03:14:56,995 --> 03:15:01,692
hard, and it just kind of, the impact sears the
wound. Cauterizing it.

2902
03:15:01,692 --> 03:15:03,604
LIAM: Don't want to be fighting you.

2903
03:15:03,604 --> 03:15:08,477
MATT: Still looking at you. He puts his hand out
and does this, and that quivering in your stomach

2904
03:15:08,477 --> 03:15:12,682
you felt earlier begins to shake and the
vibrations begin to spread through your entire

2905
03:15:12,682 --> 03:15:17,936
body. I need you to make a constitution saving
throw? Yeah.

2906
03:15:17,936 --> 03:15:19,447
SAM: You've got inspiration still.

2907
03:15:19,447 --> 03:15:21,364
LAURA: Does that work on saves?

2908
03:15:21,364 --> 03:15:22,947
LIAM: Plus inspiration.

2909
03:15:22,947 --> 03:15:24,089
MATT: Yeah.

2910
03:15:24,089 --> 03:15:29,630
LIAM: It's a 23.

2911
03:15:29,630 --> 03:15:38,492
MATT: 23. That is a success. You manage to just
stave it off as you can feel it about to tear your

2912
03:15:38,492 --> 03:15:44,743
insides apart, and you just tense real fast and
the vibrations slowly fade. No effect.

2913
03:15:44,743 --> 03:15:46,382
SAM: No effect!

2914
03:15:46,382 --> 03:15:49,043
MATT: Would've been 10d10 necrotic damage.

2915
03:15:49,043 --> 03:15:50,706
SAM: 10d10!

2916
03:15:50,706 --> 03:15:56,784
MARISHA: What happened, like a chestburster, like
came out of him?

2917
03:15:56,784 --> 03:15:58,827
MATT: It's called Quivering Palm, it's a monk
ability.

2918
03:15:58,827 --> 03:16:02,235
LIAM: It's Uma Thurman, it's fucking Kill Bill.

2919
03:16:02,235 --> 03:16:07,680
MARISHA and WILL: The five-point exploding palm
technique.

2920
03:16:07,680 --> 03:16:12,636
MATT: He's going to use another ki point, a bonus
action, as he goes into a defensive stance, a

2921
03:16:12,636 --> 03:16:14,878
familiar one that you've seen before.

2922
03:16:14,878 --> 03:16:16,469
TRAVIS: Before I whooped somebody's ass.

2923
03:16:16,469 --> 03:16:21,873
MATT: Yeah. But into this fully defensive, looking
about and keeping his eyes aware of the entirety

2924
03:16:21,873 --> 03:16:26,529
of his surroundings. And is going to stay right
there. That brings us to Grog.

2925
03:16:26,529 --> 03:16:33,138
TRAVIS: Piece of shit, I don't know what that stance
is-- I chop at him some more with Craven Edge! I

2926
03:16:33,138 --> 03:16:37,636
don't know, can I do one Great Weapon Master and
the other two just regular?

2927
03:16:37,636 --> 03:16:38,692
MATT: Yeah.

2928
03:16:38,692 --> 03:16:39,784
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm gonna do that.

2929
03:16:39,784 --> 03:16:40,788
MATT: Are you doing reckless attacks or not?

2930
03:16:40,788 --> 03:16:41,828
TRAVIS: Yeah, reckless.

2931
03:16:41,828 --> 03:16:46,443
MATT: Okay. His patient defense gives you
disadvantage on all attacks-- He just nullifies

2932
03:16:46,443 --> 03:16:49,061
it, so you just have one roll per attack.

2933
03:16:49,061 --> 03:16:50,967
TRAVIS: 16?

2934
03:16:50,967 --> 03:16:55,878
MATT: Misses. Just knocks the blade out with his
own hand, you hear it (impact) off to the side.

2935
03:16:55,878 --> 03:16:58,972
TRAVIS: 16.

2936
03:16:58,972 --> 03:17:03,938
MATT: This time he actually catches with the two
sides of his hand and throws it back towards you.

2937
03:17:03,938 --> 03:17:05,924
SAM: You could be inspired, god damn it!

2938
03:17:05,924 --> 03:17:08,845
MARY: It's right there.

2939
03:17:08,845 --> 03:17:17,032
TRAVIS: I'm gonna use my other d10 that's not
tainted, so not this one.

2940
03:17:17,032 --> 03:17:19,720
SAM: All you have to do is pledge allegiance to
the Washington football team.

2941
03:17:19,720 --> 03:17:21,945
(laughter)

2942
03:17:21,945 --> 03:17:24,169
WILL: Wow.

2943
03:17:24,169 --> 03:17:28,159
TRAVIS: 27.

2944
03:17:28,159 --> 03:17:32,781
MATT: 27. He goes to try and catch it, but you
change the direction of the blade at the last

2945
03:17:32,781 --> 03:17:35,185
minute and find the side of his flesh, go ahead
and roll damage.

2946
03:17:35,185 --> 03:17:39,934
TRAVIS: Okay. So 12. 19.

2947
03:17:39,934 --> 03:17:41,188
MATT: He does make his save on that.

2948
03:17:41,188 --> 03:17:42,664
TRAVIS: 29. Damn it, he does?

2949
03:17:42,664 --> 03:17:44,022
MATT: 29 damage.

2950
03:17:44,022 --> 03:17:45,305
TRAVIS: 29. All that.

2951
03:17:45,305 --> 03:17:46,923
MATT: He's got a decent constitution.

2952
03:17:46,923 --> 03:17:48,190
TRAVIS: Yeah, you think?

2953
03:17:48,190 --> 03:17:52,379
MATT: All right, so the third blade finally sinks
in about two inches into his clavicle area and

2954
03:17:52,379 --> 03:17:56,472
probably would snap the clavicle bone if he hadn't
put his hands up and caught as much of the impact

2955
03:17:56,472 --> 03:18:00,530
as he could, and then throws it back again and
just kicks you away to get a little bit of

2956
03:18:00,530 --> 03:18:01,817
distance.

2957
03:18:01,817 --> 03:18:04,204
TRAVIS: Shit, really? Little distance, or?

2958
03:18:04,204 --> 03:18:07,462
MATT: It's just like a foot, just away from being
clenched up.

2959
03:18:07,462 --> 03:18:13,223
TRAVIS: Okay. Can I move opposite of where my two
lads are so I stay behind him again?

2960
03:18:13,223 --> 03:18:17,454
MATT: Right there? Yeah, you can do that. Go for
it. All right, that ends your turn?

2961
03:18:17,454 --> 03:18:18,276
TRAVIS: Yep.

2962
03:18:18,276 --> 03:18:24,113
MATT: Scanlan, you're up. Well, let me see
actually if he resists the-- Nope.

2963
03:18:24,113 --> 03:18:26,241
SAM: Still sick.

2964
03:18:26,241 --> 03:18:29,765
MATT: Actually, actually no, remembering this,
because I kept forgetting to do it before, but

2965
03:18:29,765 --> 03:18:33,135
that's fine, he's gonna use his legendary
resistance to automatically succeed, so he no

2966
03:18:33,135 --> 03:18:34,398
longer has Eyebite.

2967
03:18:34,398 --> 03:18:35,500
SAM: Oh, so he's done.

2968
03:18:35,500 --> 03:18:38,173
LAURA: He's not shitting himself anymore.

2969
03:18:38,173 --> 03:18:41,354
MARY: No. But the stench is great.

2970
03:18:41,354 --> 03:18:48,520
MATT: So sickness fades. He spent last round not
doing any actual physical

2971
03:18:48,520 --> 03:18:49,939
attacks for that reason.

2972
03:18:49,939 --> 03:18:56,781
SAM: All right. Well. I'm far away from him, but
Grog's right next to him, so I probably shouldn't

2973
03:18:56,781 --> 03:18:58,399
do anything too terrible.

2974
03:18:58,399 --> 03:18:59,736
TRAVIS: Do it! Do it!

2975
03:18:59,736 --> 03:19:01,046
LIAM: But he's a sponge!

2976
03:19:01,046 --> 03:19:04,164
TRAVIS: Do it! If you don't do it, he will, do
it.

2977
03:19:04,164 --> 03:19:05,834
MARISHA: That's why we have Grog around.

2978
03:19:05,834 --> 03:19:13,161
SAM: I'll join in the bludgeon-fest, and I will
cast (sings) Bigby's Hand! And I will, I'll make

2979
03:19:13,161 --> 03:19:18,806
it come right next to him, sort of between him and
Grog? I can't get between him and Grog.

2980
03:19:18,806 --> 03:19:21,410
MATT: There you go. Not between them, no, but you
can put it like next to him or behind him.

2981
03:19:21,410 --> 03:19:30,364
SAM: Okay. To the side, to the side would be good.
And just punch! Just a couple punches. Just

2982
03:19:30,364 --> 03:19:32,178
throwing some punches.

2983
03:19:32,178 --> 03:19:34,489
TALIESIN: Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting
yourself. Stop hitting yourself.

2984
03:19:34,489 --> 03:19:36,818
MATT: Make a melee spell attack.

2985
03:19:36,818 --> 03:19:38,281
SAM: Melee spell attack.

2986
03:19:38,281 --> 03:19:39,742
MATT: Got it, melee spell attack.

2987
03:19:39,742 --> 03:19:41,275
SAM: What do I add?

2988
03:19:41,275 --> 03:19:43,228
MATT: You add your spell attack modifier, which
should be on your spell page.

2989
03:19:43,228 --> 03:19:44,798
LIAM: On your same page, your spell page.

2990
03:19:44,798 --> 03:19:50,919
SAM: Spell attack bonus-- Okay. 27.

2991
03:19:50,919 --> 03:19:55,989
MATT: 27, that's a hit. As the hand appears to his
right, he's still focusing on Grog and glances

2992
03:19:55,989 --> 03:20:00,010
over for a second and tries to do a deflection,
technically he's still in his defense stance,

2993
03:20:00,010 --> 03:20:02,830
though. So roll twice, because he does have
disadvantage for attacks on him.

2994
03:20:02,830 --> 03:20:05,504
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good.

2995
03:20:05,504 --> 03:20:08,069
SAM: That was a natural 20.

2996
03:20:08,069 --> 03:20:09,075
MATT: Yeah.

2997
03:20:09,075 --> 03:20:16,325
SAM: But the disadvantage, so the 27. Yes. Oh
wait, now I roll for damage.

2998
03:20:16,325 --> 03:20:17,462
MATT: Yep.

2999
03:20:17,462 --> 03:20:19,013
SAM: With Bigby's Hand. I rarely do this.

3000
03:20:19,013 --> 03:20:20,660
TRAVIS: That's true, yeah.

3001
03:20:20,660 --> 03:20:22,050
MATT: 4d8 force damage.

3002
03:20:22,050 --> 03:20:23,018
SAM: 4d8.

3003
03:20:23,018 --> 03:20:27,178
LAURA: You need to do that more, that's pretty
good.

3004
03:20:27,178 --> 03:20:28,474
LIAM: Come on, Scanbo.

3005
03:20:28,474 --> 03:20:39,023
SAM: I'll just roll this one four times, it's
fine. 17?

3006
03:20:39,023 --> 03:20:40,354
MATT: 17 damage.

3007
03:20:40,354 --> 03:20:41,485
SAM: 4d8, right?

3008
03:20:41,485 --> 03:20:46,377
MATT: Yep. So as Bigby's Hand pulls back with a
giant fist, the fingers cracking in an arcane

3009
03:20:46,377 --> 03:20:52,992
echo, whack! Slams into his side, he holds himself
strong and actually slides about seven inches in

3010
03:20:52,992 --> 03:21:00,293
the sand from the impact. And you can see him
shake off his arm from the hit. Yeah, that hurt.

3011
03:21:00,293 --> 03:21:06,656
SAM: Decent, decent. And I will inspire Grog
again, with a little ditty, I will say, (singing)

3012
03:21:06,656 --> 03:21:14,061
You're a psycho killer, with a bearded face, Grog
Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog. Run r--

3013
03:21:14,061 --> 03:21:15,219
That's fine.

3014
03:21:15,219 --> 03:21:16,673
MATT: All right, take your d10.

3015
03:21:16,673 --> 03:21:18,432
(laughter)

3016
03:21:18,432 --> 03:21:19,657
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

3017
03:21:19,657 --> 03:21:23,127
LIAM: I just drop to my knees so I can aim better
and right over Scanlan's shoulder,

3018
03:21:23,127 --> 03:21:24,674
dagger, dagger, dagger.

3019
03:21:24,674 --> 03:21:25,867
MATT: Go for it.

3020
03:21:25,867 --> 03:21:30,896
LIAM: Okay, first one is a one. So that misses.
Second one is a 23.

3021
03:21:30,896 --> 03:21:33,686
MATT: 23. You're rolling disadvantage on all
these, right?

3022
03:21:33,686 --> 03:21:35,056
LIAM: Disadvantage? For what?

3023
03:21:35,056 --> 03:21:38,232
MATT: For all these attacks, because he's still in
his patient defense stance.

3024
03:21:38,232 --> 03:21:39,385
LIAM: Oh shite.

3025
03:21:39,385 --> 03:21:40,915
MATT: So what was this roll you just got--

3026
03:21:40,915 --> 03:21:42,393
LIAM: Well, the first one was a one and a--

3027
03:21:42,393 --> 03:21:45,674
MATT: Yeah, first one missed. The second one was a
23 and what did you roll?

3028
03:21:45,674 --> 03:21:47,275
LIAM: I don't remember what it was. Sorry.

3029
03:21:47,275 --> 03:21:48,496
MATT: Roll again, it's fine.

3030
03:21:48,496 --> 03:21:51,576
LIAM: All right, so this is the second attack.
That is a 17.

3031
03:21:51,576 --> 03:21:52,823
MATT: Misses.

3032
03:21:52,823 --> 03:21:56,069
LIAM: Third attack is a 21.

3033
03:21:56,069 --> 03:21:57,268
MATT: 21 misses.

3034
03:21:57,268 --> 03:21:58,476
(groaning)

3035
03:21:58,476 --> 03:22:03,844
MATT: So all three daggers come at him and he just
dodges one right off the head, another one he

3036
03:22:03,844 --> 03:22:08,178
parries out of the way, and the third one he does
a crescent kick-- whack!-- and knocks the dagger

3037
03:22:08,178 --> 03:22:11,225
out of the air that spins off to the side before
it returns to your belt.

3038
03:22:11,225 --> 03:22:13,636
LIAM: And just under my breath I say, "So fucking
cool."

3039
03:22:13,636 --> 03:22:15,528
(laughter)

3040
03:22:15,528 --> 03:22:24,461
MATT: At the end of your turn before it's his turn
he's gonna go ahead and use one action point to

3041
03:22:24,461 --> 03:22:31,069
use Like the Wind, where he moves his speed
without taking attacks of opportunity. He turns

3042
03:22:31,069 --> 03:22:35,298
and rushes up to Scanlan.

3043
03:22:35,298 --> 03:22:37,364
SAM: I'm a little boy!

3044
03:22:37,364 --> 03:22:42,918
MATT: Starting his turn, now, he's gonna come for
you, Scanlan, he's gonna go ahead and do a flurry

3045
03:22:42,918 --> 03:22:44,130
of blows against you.

3046
03:22:44,130 --> 03:22:45,780
LAURA: Oh no, Scanlan!

3047
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:51,310
MATT: So. Scanlan. First attack is 29.

3048
03:22:51,310 --> 03:22:52,665
SAM: Yeah.

3049
03:22:52,665 --> 03:22:54,317
MATT: Natural one, fails on the second one.

3050
03:22:54,317 --> 03:22:57,977
SAM: Okay, I'll use Cutting Words on the last
one.

3051
03:22:57,977 --> 03:23:04,708
MATT: Okay, well the third one is a 20. And the
fourth one is a 31.

3052
03:23:04,708 --> 03:23:06,449
TRAVIS: Jesus.

3053
03:23:06,449 --> 03:23:07,558
MATT: So three hits.

3054
03:23:07,558 --> 03:23:12,071
SAM: But I'm using Cutting Words on the third one
to try to--

3055
03:23:12,071 --> 03:23:13,503
LIAM: You said the last one.

3056
03:23:13,503 --> 03:23:14,672
SAM: No, I said the third one.

3057
03:23:14,672 --> 03:23:16,406
MARISHA: It doesn't matter, they all suck.

3058
03:23:16,406 --> 03:23:23,457
MATT: Whichever one you want. So the first one
hits, Cutting Words to reduce the attack on the--

3059
03:23:23,457 --> 03:23:25,162
SAM: On the one that was a 20.

3060
03:23:25,162 --> 03:23:26,965
MATT: Yeah. So go ahead and roll your d10.

3061
03:23:26,965 --> 03:23:29,598
SAM: Okay. Six.

3062
03:23:29,598 --> 03:23:31,167
MATT: Six. What's your AC?

3063
03:23:31,167 --> 03:23:32,066
SAM: 17.

3064
03:23:32,066 --> 03:23:35,865
MATT: Yeah, no, so you manage to, what do you
shout at him as he's doing these punches against you?

3065
03:23:35,865 --> 03:23:40,175
SAM: I sing, (singing) No no no no, don't phunk
with my heart!

3066
03:23:40,175 --> 03:23:42,452
(laughter)

3067
03:23:42,452 --> 03:23:47,362
MATT: He cocks his head like a confused puppy for
a second and the fist just hits air above your head.

3068
03:23:47,362 --> 03:23:49,309
TRAVIS: You've gotta be kidding me, man.

3069
03:23:49,309 --> 03:23:54,128
MATT: However, you do take 14 points of
bludgeoning damage from the first strike, and

3070
03:23:54,128 --> 03:24:01,810
another 14 points of bludgeoning damage, so a
total of 28 points of bludgeoning damage from two

3071
03:24:01,810 --> 03:24:06,143
hits. Go ahead and make a dex saving throw, if you
could.

3072
03:24:06,143 --> 03:24:09,010
SAM: Dex, dex, dex.

3073
03:24:09,010 --> 03:24:10,249
TALIESIN: Four.

3074
03:24:10,249 --> 03:24:14,759
SAM: 16. Oh, plus four? Really? Okay. Oh, yeah.
Saw that for some reason there's a plus four

3075
03:24:14,759 --> 03:24:15,911
there. 20.

3076
03:24:15,911 --> 03:24:19,106
MATT: 20's what you need. His last hit, he's
trying to kick you square in the chest and knock

3077
03:24:19,106 --> 03:24:23,359
you off your feet, and while it hits you, it
actually forces you back into Vax, and Vax holds

3078
03:24:23,359 --> 03:24:25,210
you up and you manage to keep on your feet.

3079
03:24:25,210 --> 03:24:26,467
LIAM: Whoa, buddy.

3080
03:24:26,467 --> 03:24:28,689
SAM: Oh, hi. I'm between two strong men.

3081
03:24:28,689 --> 03:24:30,503
LIAM: Debatable.

3082
03:24:30,503 --> 03:24:32,792
SAM: I'm lucky Pierre.

3083
03:24:32,792 --> 03:24:35,745
MATT: Or no, it's Grog's turn, it's Grog's turn,
because you just took yours, yeah.

3084
03:24:35,745 --> 03:24:37,811
TRAVIS: It's my turn? Yeah, I just keep swinging
away.

3085
03:24:37,811 --> 03:24:39,056
MATT: So you're gonna move up to him?

3086
03:24:39,056 --> 03:24:40,308
TRAVIS: Yes, please.

3087
03:24:40,308 --> 03:24:43,103
MATT: Oh, and as a note, I need you to make a
concentration check for both of those hits, they

3088
03:24:43,103 --> 03:24:46,636
were 14 damage each, so, and you have Warcaster,
right?

3089
03:24:46,636 --> 03:24:48,765
SAM: Oh, yes. Oh yes.

3090
03:24:48,765 --> 03:24:55,507
MATT: So go ahead and make constitution checks.
Constitution. Let me look at this.

3091
03:24:55,507 --> 03:25:07,048
SAM: That's 11 plus two is 13, right? Not great,
not great. And 14. 13 and 14.

3092
03:25:07,048 --> 03:25:11,654
MATT: Okay, yeah, that's gonna end concentration,
Bigby's Hand off the table.

3093
03:25:11,654 --> 03:25:13,329
SAM: (gasps) Bigby's Hand is gone.

3094
03:25:13,329 --> 03:25:18,744
MATT: Too much damage for you on that one. So from
the impact of the blows you just managed, the

3095
03:25:18,744 --> 03:25:23,545
spell fizzles from your mind and the hand dissipates
into the distance. All right, now, Grog.

3096
03:25:23,545 --> 03:25:25,975
TRAVIS: At the end of his turn, did he go back
into his defensive pose?

3097
03:25:25,975 --> 03:25:26,849
MATT: No.

3098
03:25:26,849 --> 03:25:33,931
TRAVIS: Okay, great. Okay, so, reckless attack.
That's, let's make it Great Weapon Master with the

3099
03:25:33,931 --> 03:25:38,528
inspiration. 24.

3100
03:25:38,528 --> 03:25:39,790
MATT: 24 hits.

3101
03:25:39,790 --> 03:25:40,990
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3102
03:25:40,990 --> 03:25:44,031
MATT: You've gotta say Great Weapon Master before
you roll, by the way.

3103
03:25:44,031 --> 03:25:45,529
TRAVIS: Should I do it for the next one, then?

3104
03:25:45,529 --> 03:25:46,329
MATT: Yeah.

3105
03:25:46,329 --> 03:25:47,378
TRAVIS: Okay. So that one didn't.

3106
03:25:47,378 --> 03:25:51,600
MATT: Because it can't be like, oh, that doesn't
hit, I'm not gonna do Great Weapon Master yet, you

3107
03:25:51,600 --> 03:25:53,259
have to get the penalty before you roll.

3108
03:25:53,259 --> 03:25:55,963
TRAVIS: Right, that makes sense. Right. So it was
a 29, no, I mean it wasn't. What?

3109
03:25:55,963 --> 03:25:59,469
MATT: You said it was a 24, for that one it
would've been a twenty--- it hit regardless.

3110
03:25:59,469 --> 03:26:00,746
TRAVIS: Okay. Hit regardless.

3111
03:26:00,746 --> 03:26:02,273
MATT: So yeah. So the first one was just a regular
hit.

3112
03:26:02,273 --> 03:26:06,752
TRAVIS: So we'll do the third one will be Great
Weapon Master. This is disadvantage. Come on,

3113
03:26:06,752 --> 03:26:08,836
where are the damn crits? 20.

3114
03:26:08,836 --> 03:26:10,088
MATT: 20 misses.

3115
03:26:10,088 --> 03:26:12,759
TRAVIS: Yep, okay, this is Great Weapon Master.
With adva-- with the inspiraton.

3116
03:26:12,759 --> 03:26:14,975
MATT: Yeah. So.

3117
03:26:14,975 --> 03:26:22,604
TRAVIS: 28? No, minus five. 23.

3118
03:26:22,604 --> 03:26:23,818
MATT: 23 just hits.

3119
03:26:23,818 --> 03:26:25,790
(cheering)

3120
03:26:25,790 --> 03:26:30,045
MATT: So a regular hit, and then a Great Weapon
Master hit.

3121
03:26:30,045 --> 03:26:36,045
TRAVIS: Okay. Six, 11, 19 is the first
one.

3122
03:26:36,045 --> 03:26:38,967
MATT: 19 damage, all right.

3123
03:26:38,967 --> 03:26:42,997
TRAVIS: Fuck. Nine, 17, 27.

3124
03:26:42,997 --> 03:26:50,066
MATT: 27, got it. Both of the strikes, makes his
save, makes his save.

3125
03:26:50,066 --> 03:26:53,046
TRAVIS: (sputters) Not once?

3126
03:26:53,046 --> 03:26:55,621
MATT: It's a 12 DC, it's not a very hard DC for--

3127
03:26:55,621 --> 03:26:57,636
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he's gotta roll shitty
sometimes.

3128
03:26:57,636 --> 03:27:04,916
MATT: He probably will eventually. So anyway. As
you're striking the blades at him, the pain, he's

3129
03:27:04,916 --> 03:27:08,196
just taking the pain to his back, now, because
he's facing Scanlan, and both times hack into the

3130
03:27:08,196 --> 03:27:11,700
back of his shoulderblades and the exposed muscle
you can see as the blade draws back you can see

3131
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:17,476
the muscle and the blood arcing after each
draw of the weapon. However, he glances over his

3132
03:27:17,476 --> 03:27:20,504
shoulder at you as you finish your second blow and
at the end of your turn he's gonna use two action

3133
03:27:20,504 --> 03:27:22,141
points to use Whirlwind of Blows--

3134
03:27:22,141 --> 03:27:24,865
TRAVIS: Can I move? Oh, I already moved.

3135
03:27:24,865 --> 03:27:27,499
MATT: You already moved, yeah. I mean, you can
keep moving if you wanted to move away.

3136
03:27:27,499 --> 03:27:31,238
TRAVIS: I wanted to move in between him and
Scanlan, just wrap around.

3137
03:27:31,238 --> 03:27:32,870
MATT: You can't move between, but you can get
there if you want.

3138
03:27:32,870 --> 03:27:33,903
TRAVIS: Okay, that'd be good.

3139
03:27:33,903 --> 03:27:37,447
MATT: Okay. So he's gonna get an attack on
everyone within range of his punches, which would

3140
03:27:37,447 --> 03:27:41,163
be you and Scanlan. That is gonna be a 26 against
you.

3141
03:27:41,163 --> 03:27:42,113
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3142
03:27:42,113 --> 03:27:45,769
MATT: And a natural 20 against Scanlan.

3143
03:27:45,769 --> 03:27:48,084
SAM: That doesn't hit. That doesn't hit.

3144
03:27:48,084 --> 03:27:51,061
(laughter)

3145
03:27:51,061 --> 03:27:57,357
MATT: First to you, Grog, that is 18 points of
bludgeoning damage. Halved to nine. And Scanlan,

3146
03:27:57,357 --> 03:28:06,806
that is six, no, sorry-- 24 points of bludgeoning
damage.

3147
03:28:06,806 --> 03:28:13,272
SAM: Ah, that's not bad. I'll be fine.

3148
03:28:13,272 --> 03:28:15,254
MATT: All right. Now it's Scanlan's turn.

3149
03:28:15,254 --> 03:28:17,163
SAM: Oh, shit, I get to do more shit?

3150
03:28:17,163 --> 03:28:18,669
TRAVIS: Where you at?

3151
03:28:18,669 --> 03:28:20,122
SAM: I'm fine.

3152
03:28:20,122 --> 03:28:21,573
TALIESIN: Looking a little rough.

3153
03:28:21,573 --> 03:28:23,819
SAM: Fine. Monk's got nothing on me.

3154
03:28:23,819 --> 03:28:25,793
MATT: So last turn you missed all three on him,
remember?

3155
03:28:25,793 --> 03:28:27,080
LIAM: Oh, thanks.

3156
03:28:27,080 --> 03:28:36,441
SAM: So he's right next to me, he's right next to
all of us. Okay. Well, I will-- he's right next to me?

3157
03:28:36,441 --> 03:28:37,435
MATT: Yep.

3158
03:28:37,435 --> 03:28:42,572
SAM: And no one's behind him. So I will just
Lightning Bolt him. From right there. Can I do that?

3159
03:28:42,572 --> 03:28:46,905
MATT: You can, yeah. So as you're there in front,
you just reach back--

3160
03:28:46,905 --> 03:28:52,950
SAM: Oh, I've got something in my pocket,
(yells).

3161
03:28:52,950 --> 03:28:54,759
(laughter)

3162
03:28:54,759 --> 03:28:55,952
MATT: All right.

3163
03:28:55,952 --> 03:28:58,011
TALIESIN: You let the lightning out of the
bottle.

3164
03:28:58,011 --> 03:29:00,344
MATT: What's the DC? I imagine this was out of
your--

3165
03:29:00,344 --> 03:29:02,272
SAM: Is this my spell DC? So 19.

3166
03:29:02,272 --> 03:29:04,448
MATT: 19 with the hand cone, so you were like,
hup, yaaaa!

3167
03:29:04,448 --> 03:29:05,724
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

3168
03:29:05,724 --> 03:29:07,770
MATT: 19.

3169
03:29:07,770 --> 03:29:09,749
TALIESIN: Need some d6's, man?

3170
03:29:09,749 --> 03:29:16,356
MATT: He's going to use another of his legendary
resistances to make the save. And he has evasion,

3171
03:29:16,356 --> 03:29:21,614
which means dex save for half, he gets no damage
on his success, so as you do Lightning Bolt, he

3172
03:29:21,614 --> 03:29:25,521
literally just goes into the splits as the bolt
streaks over his head.

3173
03:29:25,521 --> 03:29:27,469
LIAM: He Van Damme'd it!

3174
03:29:27,469 --> 03:29:34,509
MATT: Slams one of the nearby pillars, and as you
realize that, you look down at him as he squeezes

3175
03:29:34,509 --> 03:29:37,111
his legs back together and lands right back on his
feet.

3176
03:29:37,111 --> 03:29:39,239
WILL: Oh, god. He took no Van Damme-age.

3177
03:29:39,239 --> 03:29:43,763
(laughter)

3178
03:29:43,763 --> 03:29:49,526
SAM: He's fast as lightning. Damn it.

3179
03:29:49,526 --> 03:29:50,833
MATT: Is that your turn?

3180
03:29:50,833 --> 03:29:56,060
SAM: I mean, that's all I can do. You know what,
I'll use my bonus action to heal myself a bit.

3181
03:29:56,060 --> 03:29:57,402
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3182
03:29:57,402 --> 03:30:14,499
SAM: I'll use Healing Word on myself at third level.
So that's two, 3d4 plus five, right? Ten, ten plus

3183
03:30:14,499 --> 03:30:17,616
five. Ten plus five. Okay, 15. Yeah, that's good.
Yeah, I'll take that.

3184
03:30:17,616 --> 03:30:20,218
MATT: Sure, go for it. All right, that ends your
turn, Vax, you're up.

3185
03:30:20,218 --> 03:30:24,362
LIAM: You might already know this, but I'm wearing
my Cloak of Displacement, so he should be at

3186
03:30:24,362 --> 03:30:25,655
disadvantage to hit me.

3187
03:30:25,655 --> 03:30:27,200
MATT: Good to know going forward.

3188
03:30:27,200 --> 03:30:33,115
LIAM: Yeah, thanks. I want to use one action to
grab Scanlan by his purple shirt and rip him and

3189
03:30:33,115 --> 03:30:34,494
pull him away.

3190
03:30:34,494 --> 03:30:35,807
MATT: That's gonna be your action.

3191
03:30:35,807 --> 03:30:36,659
LIAM: Sure.

3192
03:30:36,659 --> 03:30:37,999
MATT: So you won't have any attacks this round.

3193
03:30:37,999 --> 03:30:39,742
LIAM: With Boots of Haste on?

3194
03:30:39,742 --> 03:30:43,133
MATT: In order to get the additional, well, actually
no, you would get one attack from the haste.

3195
03:30:43,133 --> 03:30:46,792
You would. Your offhand attack you don't get
unless you're doing an attack action, so you get

3196
03:30:46,792 --> 03:30:47,938
one attack.

3197
03:30:47,938 --> 03:30:51,337
LIAM: That's fine, that's fine, I rip him, I yank
him away and throw the little bugger.

3198
03:30:51,337 --> 03:30:55,925
SAM: As I fly through the air, I'm looking up to
see if Kashaw's putting any moves on Keyleth or

3199
03:30:55,925 --> 03:30:57,328
anything.

3200
03:30:57,328 --> 03:30:59,608
WILL: Great fight, man!

3201
03:30:59,608 --> 03:31:01,033
MARISHA: (screaming)

3202
03:31:01,033 --> 03:31:02,251
WILL: Great fight!

3203
03:31:02,251 --> 03:31:03,521
MARISHA: Oh god!

3204
03:31:03,521 --> 03:31:12,167
LIAM: And then throw a dagger past Grog at him.
For-- not that great. 19.

3205
03:31:12,167 --> 03:31:15,755
MATT: 19?

3206
03:31:15,755 --> 03:31:16,775
LIAM: 19, that's it.

3207
03:31:16,775 --> 03:31:17,823
MATT: Misses, yeah.

3208
03:31:17,823 --> 03:31:22,370
LIAM: Okay, so I threw him, I threw a dagger and
missed, and I just juke to the right and get

3209
03:31:22,370 --> 03:31:23,600
behind Grog.

3210
03:31:23,600 --> 03:31:28,998
MATT: Okay. So move there. At the end of your
turn, he's gonna use his last action point to do

3211
03:31:28,998 --> 03:31:36,057
an unarmed attack against Grog. That's gonna be a
21?

3212
03:31:36,057 --> 03:31:37,054
TRAVIS: Pretty sure.

3213
03:31:37,054 --> 03:31:38,273
MATT: It hits? Okay.

3214
03:31:38,273 --> 03:31:39,995
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty sure.

3215
03:31:39,995 --> 03:31:43,038
MATT: You take ten points of bludgeoning damage.

3216
03:31:43,038 --> 03:31:44,271
TRAVIS: Halved to five.

3217
03:31:44,271 --> 03:31:47,854
MATT: Half. He's gonna use another ki point to, I
need you to make a constitution save.

3218
03:31:47,854 --> 03:31:53,744
TRAVIS: Okay. 17.

3219
03:31:53,744 --> 03:32:00,366
MATT: 17. As he turns back and slams his fist
right in the center of your clavicle, you feel a

3220
03:32:00,366 --> 03:32:04,950
crack in the sternum and your whole body, all your
muscles just seize up and you are currently

3221
03:32:04,950 --> 03:32:08,187
stunned from a stunning strike until the end of
his next turn.

3222
03:32:08,187 --> 03:32:14,770
LIAM: We got this, guys.

3223
03:32:14,770 --> 03:32:16,932
MATT: However, it's now his next turn.

3224
03:32:16,932 --> 03:32:18,009
LAURA: Oh no.

3225
03:32:18,009 --> 03:32:27,173
MATT: But you're still stunned. He is now going
to, since you don't have a threat to him, he's

3226
03:32:27,173 --> 03:32:33,733
going to swing around, jump between the two of
them, and he's gonna do a flurry of blows, two

3227
03:32:33,733 --> 03:32:42,000
punches against each of you. Against Scanlan,
that's a 17?

3228
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:45,229
SAM: That's my armor class, 17.

3229
03:32:45,229 --> 03:32:47,159
MATT: That hits, okay. Second one is a 17 again.

3230
03:32:47,159 --> 03:32:49,961
SAM: Can I use my Cutting Words on that one?

3231
03:32:49,961 --> 03:32:54,281
MATT: Do you have any more uses of your bardic
inspiration?

3232
03:32:54,281 --> 03:32:55,497
SAM: It's once per turn.

3233
03:32:55,497 --> 03:32:58,684
MATT: You have a limited number of bardic
inspirations per short rest that you can use, and

3234
03:32:58,684 --> 03:33:00,260
you've used quite a few this battle.

3235
03:33:00,260 --> 03:33:02,804
SAM: Oh, that's considered a bardic inspiration,
my Cutting Words?

3236
03:33:02,804 --> 03:33:08,049
MATT: Yeah, you use one of those dice to reduce
the damage. You've inspired at least--

3237
03:33:08,049 --> 03:33:10,499
LIAM: Me once, Grog once--

3238
03:33:10,499 --> 03:33:11,761
MATT: Grog twice now.

3239
03:33:11,761 --> 03:33:20,337
SAM: It says, bardic inspiration, no that's not
it, is it? 1d10, is that, five?

3240
03:33:20,337 --> 03:33:21,690
TALIESIN: Five, you have five of those.

3241
03:33:21,690 --> 03:33:23,177
MATT: So this would be your last one.

3242
03:33:23,177 --> 03:33:24,193
SAM: Okay, I'm using it.

3243
03:33:24,193 --> 03:33:25,153
MATT: All right, go for it.

3244
03:33:25,153 --> 03:33:27,050
SAM: It's a d10, yeah?

3245
03:33:27,050 --> 03:33:29,453
TALIESIN: Yeah. Although to be fair, it doesn't
matter what you roll.

3246
03:33:29,453 --> 03:33:30,658
MATT: It doesn't matter what you roll, you're
still.

3247
03:33:30,658 --> 03:33:31,806
SAM: Hey, I rolled a six.

3248
03:33:31,806 --> 03:33:35,741
MATT: Okay, so one of the attacks, as he's coming
for you, he hits you once, and as he rears back

3249
03:33:35,741 --> 03:33:37,506
for another kick to the side of your head, you
shout--

3250
03:33:37,506 --> 03:33:39,531
SAM: Don't hit me, I'm a little boy!

3251
03:33:39,531 --> 03:33:42,779
(laughter)

3252
03:33:42,779 --> 03:33:45,896
MATT: Just enough pause for you to duck out of the
way. However, he uses that inertia to spin back on

3253
03:33:45,896 --> 03:33:49,208
Vax for a 27.

3254
03:33:49,208 --> 03:33:50,697
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

3255
03:33:50,697 --> 03:33:52,344
MATT: And a 21.

3256
03:33:52,344 --> 03:33:53,603
LIAM: That hits.

3257
03:33:53,603 --> 03:33:54,313
MATT: Okay.

3258
03:33:54,313 --> 03:33:56,242
LIAM: So first one Uncanny Dodge, second one full
brunt.

3259
03:33:56,242 --> 03:33:58,005
MATT: So Scanlan, you take nine points of
bludgeoning damage.

3260
03:33:58,005 --> 03:34:00,642
SAM: Not bad.

3261
03:34:00,642 --> 03:34:02,042
MATT: Vex, you take, ah--

3262
03:34:02,042 --> 03:34:03,022
LIAM: I'm Vax.

3263
03:34:03,022 --> 03:34:04,497
MATT: Sorry, Vax. Every now and then.

3264
03:34:04,497 --> 03:34:05,678
LIAM: Every time.

3265
03:34:05,678 --> 03:34:07,864
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
half.

3266
03:34:07,864 --> 03:34:09,025
LIAM: Seven. Yeah.

3267
03:34:09,025 --> 03:34:10,845
MATT: And the other one is nine points.

3268
03:34:10,845 --> 03:34:11,951
LIAM: Nine points.

3269
03:34:11,951 --> 03:34:12,791
MATT: Yep.

3270
03:34:12,791 --> 03:34:13,779
LIAM: Okay.

3271
03:34:13,779 --> 03:34:20,459
MATT: So a total of 16 points of damage. He's
going to use a ki point again, I need you to make

3272
03:34:20,459 --> 03:34:24,207
a constitution saving throw.

3273
03:34:24,207 --> 03:34:30,116
LIAM: Okay. It's gonna be great. 14.

3274
03:34:30,116 --> 03:34:35,545
MATT: 14. Towards the end of his turn, Grog's stun
shifts off of him, you feel your muscles tense up

3275
03:34:35,545 --> 03:34:42,457
and you almost fall to your knees as your whole body
seizes, the muscles just lock in place. All

3276
03:34:42,457 --> 03:34:47,821
righty. Grog, it's your turn.

3277
03:34:47,821 --> 03:34:55,865
TRAVIS: I'm gonna take Craven Edge and I'm gonna
stab him into the sand. And I'm gonna take out the

3278
03:34:55,865 --> 03:34:57,835
Firebrand Warhammer instead.

3279
03:34:57,835 --> 03:35:06,720
MATT: Okay. So you drop the weapon for free, you
pull out the fire hammer and it bursts into flame

3280
03:35:06,720 --> 03:35:14,138
in your hands as you wield it. As you drop Craven
Edge, you hear this voice scream in the back of

3281
03:35:14,138 --> 03:35:25,646
your head, "You fool! This fight is ours!" As the
hammer lights up, you just feel this cold dread

3282
03:35:25,646 --> 03:35:29,823
run down your spine. I need you to make a will
saving throw. A wisdom saving throw.

3283
03:35:29,823 --> 03:35:33,494
TRAVIS: Ten?

3284
03:35:33,494 --> 03:35:41,337
MATT: Ten? You can't possibly let that blade go
away, and you drop the hammer and pick up Craven

3285
03:35:41,337 --> 03:35:44,046
Edge once more. This is the true weapon of a
warrior.

3286
03:35:44,046 --> 03:35:45,390
TRAVIS: You're right, it is.

3287
03:35:45,390 --> 03:35:47,252
(laughter)

3288
03:35:47,252 --> 03:35:50,052
MATT: And you are not gonna relinquish it. There
is no way you could let go of this blade.

3289
03:35:50,052 --> 03:35:53,777
TRAVIS: No way at all. Reckless attack on all
three swings.

3290
03:35:53,777 --> 03:35:58,092
MATT: Okay. The process of picking it up, we'll
say would take away your bonus action. So you get

3291
03:35:58,092 --> 03:35:59,329
two attacks.

3292
03:35:59,329 --> 03:36:06,812
TRAVIS: 14. That sucks. That's better. 27.

3293
03:36:06,812 --> 03:36:08,078
MATT: Second one hits.

3294
03:36:08,078 --> 03:36:14,374
TRAVIS: Okay. Ow. Six, 11, 19.

3295
03:36:14,374 --> 03:36:21,292
MATT: 19, all righty. This time as the hammer
falls to the ground the flames go out and Craven

3296
03:36:21,292 --> 03:36:30,266
Edge streaks again, no, makes his saving throw. As
it hits him, he stops for a second, puts his hands

3297
03:36:30,266 --> 03:36:33,492
together. I need you to make another wisdom saving
throw.

3298
03:36:33,492 --> 03:36:36,994
(dramatic music cue)

3299
03:36:36,994 --> 03:36:40,339
WILL: Ooh, we're Star Trek fighting.

3300
03:36:40,339 --> 03:36:41,919
TRAVIS: 11.

3301
03:36:41,919 --> 03:36:50,818
MATT: Your vision goes dark as all the sight
around you goes to black and the entire vicinity

3302
03:36:50,818 --> 03:36:59,172
of this fades except for the Earthbreaker before
you, just staring at you in this darkness. Then he

3303
03:36:59,172 --> 03:37:04,481
steps towards you, one step, second step, and
while his mouth doesn't move, you can hear his

3304
03:37:04,481 --> 03:37:13,192
voice piercing into your head that just says,
"Grog. You are stronger than this thing that binds

3305
03:37:13,192 --> 03:37:18,049
"you. Where do you find your strength?"

3306
03:37:18,049 --> 03:37:22,086
TRAVIS: In my friends.

3307
03:37:22,086 --> 03:37:27,569
MATT: The darkness around you immediately shatters
and you can see now your friends off to the side,

3308
03:37:27,569 --> 03:37:35,534
keeping their weapons ready. The entirety of
Groon's posture has dropped, and he just bows

3309
03:37:35,534 --> 03:37:36,663
before you.

3310
03:37:36,663 --> 03:37:39,847
(cheering)

3311
03:37:39,847 --> 03:37:41,671
MARY: Yes! Yes!

3312
03:37:41,671 --> 03:37:43,454
WILL: Wow.

3313
03:37:43,454 --> 03:37:50,955
MATT: At this point, he takes a moment and closes
his eyes, and you can see there's this inner glow

3314
03:37:50,955 --> 03:37:59,913
in his chest, and a bunch of his wounds heal up in
but an instant. And as those wounds leave these

3315
03:37:59,913 --> 03:38:04,544
scars, he looks across the body. "I will wear
these with pride."

3316
03:38:04,544 --> 03:38:08,958
SAM: (strained) So will I.

3317
03:38:08,958 --> 03:38:13,843
(laughter)

3318
03:38:13,843 --> 03:38:21,957
SAM: Oh, fuck. Zahra! Did you see how awesome that
was? I was really good.

3319
03:38:21,957 --> 03:38:24,996
MARY: That was wonder-- you still have a little
sand right there.

3320
03:38:24,996 --> 03:38:32,605
MATT: At this point, he, Groon's not even looking
at you guys, still looking at Grog, he goes, "You

3321
03:38:32,605 --> 03:38:42,535
"need not the strength of Vasselheim to aid you,
nor is that strength any we have to give. What you

3322
03:38:42,535 --> 03:38:53,032
"need can be found, recovered, reborn. I can see in
your face the path is already lying before you. I

3323
03:38:53,032 --> 03:39:00,835
"know of two. The rest you must find yourself.

3324
03:39:00,835 --> 03:39:11,221
"A gift from Kord himself to this mortal plane,
carved from the corpse of the earth primordial

3325
03:39:11,221 --> 03:39:18,142
"titan that fell on this continent in the first
war. These Titanstone Knuckles were a symbol of

3326
03:39:18,142 --> 03:39:23,097
"power and leadership for generations here in
Vasselheim until the last known keeper was slain

3327
03:39:23,097 --> 03:39:28,576
"200 years ago, the gauntlets taken. I know not of
their whereabouts.

3328
03:39:28,576 --> 03:39:39,391
"The other, leathers adorned by the champion of
the Raven Queen. This champion's tomb has since

3329
03:39:39,391 --> 03:39:46,704
"come to ruin, sunken beneath a lake to the west of
here known as the Marrowglade Loch. Within that

3330
03:39:46,704 --> 03:40:00,408
"tomb lies the Deathwalker's Ward. Now go. You've
found your strength. You know your path. I can

3331
03:40:00,408 --> 03:40:02,407
"help you no further."

3332
03:40:02,407 --> 03:40:07,811
He turns around, walks back to the center of the
sand, and just sits back down in the same pose and

3333
03:40:07,811 --> 03:40:09,437
position he was in when you entered.

3334
03:40:09,437 --> 03:40:11,104
LAURA: He's so fucking cool.

3335
03:40:11,104 --> 03:40:13,836
TRAVIS: Scanlan. Vax.

3336
03:40:13,836 --> 03:40:15,306
SAM and LIAM: Yes.

3337
03:40:15,306 --> 03:40:17,302
TRAVIS: Do as I do.

3338
03:40:17,302 --> 03:40:18,773
LIAM: Yep.

3339
03:40:18,773 --> 03:40:20,053
TRAVIS: And I bow.

3340
03:40:20,053 --> 03:40:21,687
LIAM: (strained noise)

3341
03:40:21,687 --> 03:40:24,276
SAM: I bow as well.

3342
03:40:24,276 --> 03:40:30,966
TRAVIS: And I walk backwards, still facing him to
the edge of the pit, and I hoist Vax up.

3343
03:40:30,966 --> 03:40:32,136
LIAM: (garbled yell)

3344
03:40:32,136 --> 03:40:33,210
TRAVIS: And I throw Scanlan up.

3345
03:40:33,210 --> 03:40:34,501
SAM: Oh fuck!

3346
03:40:34,501 --> 03:40:35,858
TRAVIS: Climb out.

3347
03:40:35,858 --> 03:40:36,933
MATT: Okay.

3348
03:40:36,933 --> 03:40:43,412
MARISHA: Keyleth runs over to Vax and just hugs
him super fast and gives him a peck on the mouth.

3349
03:40:43,412 --> 03:40:44,479
LIAM: Gently!

3350
03:40:44,479 --> 03:40:47,815
MARISHA: And says, that was incredible. That was
incredible.

3351
03:40:47,815 --> 03:40:49,639
SAM: I look over at Zahra.

3352
03:40:49,639 --> 03:40:55,917
MARY: That was pretty good, darling. We'll talk
later. It really was. It was very good.

3353
03:40:55,917 --> 03:40:58,024
MARISHA: Are you okay? Do you need healing?

3354
03:40:58,024 --> 03:40:59,352
LIAM: I'm okay.

3355
03:40:59,352 --> 03:41:01,527
LAURA: (whispers) Heal him.

3356
03:41:01,527 --> 03:41:08,449
MARISHA: I give him another hug and give him a
Cure Wounds, level three.

3357
03:41:08,449 --> 03:41:09,942
MATT: All right.

3358
03:41:09,942 --> 03:41:14,514
MARY: Does it also make you sober?

3359
03:41:14,514 --> 03:41:16,017
MATT: No.

3360
03:41:16,017 --> 03:41:17,330
LIAM: No.

3361
03:41:17,330 --> 03:41:22,331
MARY: Potions have nothing to do with clearing
alcohol away?

3362
03:41:22,331 --> 03:41:23,447
LAURA: No.

3363
03:41:23,447 --> 03:41:25,492
MATT: There's a difference between the healing and
flushing one's system.

3364
03:41:25,492 --> 03:41:29,513
LIAM: Wait, wait, (vomiting noises) I'm ready.

3365
03:41:29,513 --> 03:41:30,716
LAURA: We should leave.

3366
03:41:30,716 --> 03:41:33,362
TRAVIS: I don't know about you, but I think we got
all the answers we needed.

3367
03:41:33,362 --> 03:41:35,156
MATT: Make a dexterity save, Keyleth.

3368
03:41:35,156 --> 03:41:38,316
(laughter)

3369
03:41:38,316 --> 03:41:42,051
TALIESIN: You've had this coming. You so had this
coming.

3370
03:41:42,051 --> 03:41:52,237
MARISHA: I heal you for 12 points. I heal you 12,
and then that's actually not bad. Dexterity save?

3371
03:41:52,237 --> 03:41:53,715
MATT: Yeah.

3372
03:41:53,715 --> 03:41:54,931
MARISHA: 20 total.

3373
03:41:54,931 --> 03:42:01,189
MATT: As you see his cheeks fill with bile and
liquid of your previous venture at the bar, you

3374
03:42:01,189 --> 03:42:10,250
instinctually, as the mighty speed and reaction of
an air-based Ashari druid, dodge out of the way as

3375
03:42:10,250 --> 03:42:13,256
he spatters the stonework on the outside of
this--

3376
03:42:13,256 --> 03:42:18,382
MARISHA: I hold his hair back a little bit. His
long black hair.

3377
03:42:18,382 --> 03:42:22,496
MATT: Two of the monks immediately rush forward
with towels out of seemingly nowhere and start

3378
03:42:22,496 --> 03:42:26,059
quickly cleaning it up while staring at you very,
very angrily.

3379
03:42:26,059 --> 03:42:27,777
LAURA: Sorry, we'll leave.

3380
03:42:27,777 --> 03:42:29,778
LIAM: Come on, it was their loincloths, come on.

3381
03:42:29,778 --> 03:42:31,846
TRAVIS: Apologies, apologies.

3382
03:42:31,846 --> 03:42:34,274
We should leave now.

3383
03:42:34,274 --> 03:42:37,089
MARISHA: I just look at them and I'm like, he got
hit in the gut a few times.

3384
03:42:37,089 --> 03:42:38,787
LAURA: He did, actually.

3385
03:42:38,787 --> 03:42:42,099
MARISHA: We're like a mile high, the oxygen's thin
here, it's tough.

3386
03:42:42,099 --> 03:42:43,247
LAURA: We should go.

3387
03:42:43,247 --> 03:42:44,315
MARISHA: All right, we should go.

3388
03:42:44,315 --> 03:42:49,440
LIAM: And as Keyleth helps me away, I say to Kord,
it was an honor, thank you.

3389
03:42:49,440 --> 03:42:51,024
LAURA: Kord? Groon?

3390
03:42:51,024 --> 03:42:52,501
LIAM: Whatever his name is.

3391
03:42:52,501 --> 03:42:54,079
(laughter)

3392
03:42:54,079 --> 03:42:56,864
LAURA: Or to the god that is--

3393
03:42:56,864 --> 03:43:01,004
MATT: Hey, this is a place where I think either
would work. All right. As you guys make your way

3394
03:43:01,004 --> 03:43:07,398
outside of the Trial Forge, we'll go ahead and
leave today's venture for now--

3395
03:43:07,398 --> 03:43:08,842
(yelling)

3396
03:43:08,842 --> 03:43:13,464
MATT: -- we'll return next week, return next week
to pick up this next venture and see where you

3397
03:43:13,464 --> 03:43:18,630
guys go from there. So, well done, guys. And thank
you Will and Mary for joining us.

3398
03:43:18,630 --> 03:43:20,571
(cheering)

3399
03:43:20,571 --> 03:43:22,115
MARY: Thank you for having us!

3400
03:43:22,115 --> 03:43:23,377
MATT: For a couple episodes, yeah.

3401
03:43:23,377 --> 03:43:24,585
LIAM: What a fun episode.

3402
03:43:24,585 --> 03:43:26,031
MATT: Yeah guys, well done everyone.

3403
03:43:26,031 --> 03:43:27,155
WILL: Thank you.

3404
03:43:27,155 --> 03:43:31,679
MARISHA: I saw someone on twitter say that this
was like our Cheers episode, and I agree.

3405
03:43:31,679 --> 03:43:33,470
(laughter)

3406
03:43:33,470 --> 03:43:35,027
MARISHA: I agree with whoever said that.

3407
03:43:35,027 --> 03:43:36,168
MARY: Keyleth!

3408
03:43:36,168 --> 03:43:39,778
WILL: Vasselheim: where everybody knows your
name.

3409
03:43:39,778 --> 03:43:46,244
MARY: Actually, it would be Grog. Grog walks in
the room, everybody goes Grog!
