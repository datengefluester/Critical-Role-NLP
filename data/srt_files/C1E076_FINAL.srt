00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,555
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:11,034
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. We have quite a quickly

3
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:15,513
ramping episode tonight, but before we get to
that, let's go ahead and talk about a few of our

4
00:00:15,513 --> 00:00:19,107
awesome announcements and sponsors. First up,
tonight's episode is sponsored by our good

5
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,480
friends, as always, at Loot Crate.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,555
TRAVIS: Loot Crate!

7
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:26,972
MATT: Sam, you have a few words on that?

8
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,945
SAM: Guys! I've got some talking points here. Go
to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and enter promo code

10
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:45,856
promo code "Sam reads these ahead of time. Just
kidding, that doesn't exist, but that's what

11
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:53,480
"happens when I don't read the notes ahead of
time." That was very funny, crew! Very funny! The

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,796
crew got me!

13
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:56,881
MATT: I believe that was actually supplied by Loot
Crate.

14
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,498
LAURA: No way!

15
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:01,835
TRAVIS: That is amazing.

16
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:04,339
TALIESIN: I can confirm that that is indeed--

17
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:11,740
SAM: That's amazing! They got me! Well, that's
fine. Well, I had prepared something, should I do

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:20,452
it anyway? All right, I need a little slow snap
from everybody, because this is a beat poem. Here

19
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:26,496
it is: Hey daddy-o, you get hip to some knowledge,
it's up from the school of hard knocks, not some

20
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:31,720
stuck up college, I know the Man's gonna try to
shut me down, lock me up, send me off to Vietnam,

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,917
but I've got to speak the truth, little hepcats
and kittens, because that's who I am. See right

22
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:43,510
here is a box of things that corporate America
wants you to buy, wants you to toe the party line!

23
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,418
Cut your hair, shave your goatee, and subscribe!
But me and the Ginchee guys down at Vitamin

24
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:57,718
Village say no, you dig? No to the fat cats, the
stick suits, and the company pigs! We're dragging

25
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,022
our cigs and take a swig of moonshine. Dump this
crate on the floor and look at this so-called--

26
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:09,631
actually, it's really cool stuff; it's some really
awesome stuff-- Doctor Strange! That cat is swell!

27
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:15,672
Fantastic Beasts looks crazy as hell! The box can
fold out too, and that's jazzy! Ignore what I

28
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:21,286
said before, I was just spazzing! So yeah! Loot
Crate, steal my soul, give me a discount, using

29
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:22,740
CriticalRole!

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,045
(cheering)

31
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:33,817
MATT: That was ridiculous! Wow!

32
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:41,868
TRAVIS: That was the bee's knees, daddy-o! Oh
snap! Hot damn!

33
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:43,678
SAM: And they trolled me!

34
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:48,292
MATT: And they trolled you. That's fantastic, Sam.
Thank you so much.

35
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,026
LIAM: Beat poetry-ed us to our death.

36
00:02:50,026 --> 00:03:01,449
MATT: All righty. Setting up here for the next
bout of announcements. First off, thank you to all

37
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:06,794
those who tuned in to our first episode of
Talks Machina earlier this week. It's our first

38
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:11,786
episode, and as first episodes are usually fraught
with much peril, difficulty-- technical and

39
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:19,976
mental. We hit our stride about halfway through, I
felt and I hope you guys enjoyed it. Those will be

40
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:24,863
up Thursday at 7:00. We'll have a few cast members come
in and talk to our fantastic host Brian Foster, he

41
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:26,844
is fantastic, show him some support.

42
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:30,051
TRAVIS: It was so much fun, getting to talk about
all the shit we never actually get to talk about

43
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:31,285
with other people.

44
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,587
MATT: Yeah, me and Marisha had opportunities
every now and then on certain Periscopes to kind

45
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:38,884
of chat a little bit in post-game
conversations, really cool to have a space to do

46
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:44,642
that. That's the thing, too, guys, please send in
your questions. They're extremely helpful, and I

47
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,788
like the idea that we can have some great thoughts
without just reading from a chat room that's

48
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:49,423
scrolling at a thousand miles per hour.

49
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,061
LAURA: #AskTalksMachina.

50
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:56,545
MATT: Yeah. #AskTalksMachina. Thank you very much!
Laura, do you want to talk about some of the

51
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:58,250
things that we have in the store?

52
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,169
LAURA: Oh, this is so exciting! All right, so
these fabulous bracelets and those pins that you

53
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:11,823
guys ordered a while ago? Those are shipping out
next week, you guys, so look forward to that!

54
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:16,262
You remember the limited edition patches that we
had from Comic Con? We got more of those! So

55
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:21,185
those are back in the store tonight, as well as if
you go there right now, you may notice we have a

56
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:26,269
limited run of more Gilmore's Glorious Goods
t-shirts, as well as some How Do You Want To Do

57
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:33,152
This t-shirts, and I know those are probably going
to sell out pretty fast, but they will be back in

58
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:37,374
the store in a couple of weeks, so if you order
now, you might get them before Christmas in a

59
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:41,603
couple weeks. I don't know, but we're doing our
best.

60
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,072
LIAM: You've got to get that unicorn, though.

61
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:44,384
LAURA: That unicorn, though.

62
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,248
MARISHA: It's a great shirt.

63
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,661
TALIESIN: It's my favorite shirt.

64
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:51,981
MATT: I spot them every now and then in the wild
and it's one of the weirdest experiences of my

65
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:55,772
whole life. "Should I say something? I don't know,
I feel like I should."

66
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:59,332
LIAM: Just go (inarticulate noise)--

67
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,398
LAURA: And these ones, these ones are in stock, so
they're not pre-order.

68
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:08,926
MATT: Like Donald Sutherland in The Body
Snatchers! Perfect! Perfect. I'll probably do that

69
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:13,987
from now on. Next announcement. It
recently kicked off, Patrick Rothfuss started a

70
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:17,135
wonderful charity these past couple of years
called World Builders. You can find it at

71
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:22,525
worldbuilders.org and he's asked us to help be
part of that process, to promote it, to get the

72
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:28,277
word out there and hopefully next year be even
more involved on a physical level. But if you want

73
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:32,677
to check it out, it's a fantastic gathering of
authors, writers, and creative minds to help bring

74
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:36,770
together those of our community to help make the
world a better place. Go check it out at

75
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,087
worldbuilders.org, see if it's something you want
to be a part of, donate what you can. It's a

76
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,855
fantastic cause, and they've done incredible
work these past few years. So we invite you to

77
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:49,739
join us as I'm also giving a bunch to it, and
we're helping to keep this promo chain going for

78
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:55,805
the next month, as long as it's going, so go ahead
and take a look, and be a part of it. Thank you,

79
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:58,812
Patrick, for including us in this awesomeness.
We're happy to be a part.

80
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:06,711
Also! We have a new round of playlists that have
begun. We did the character playlists last year

81
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:11,853
that seemed to go over pretty well. The first one
went up last week with Vax's playlist.

82
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,133
LIAM: It's hilarious.

83
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,516
LAURA: You had a song for me, I saw it!

84
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:16,096
MATT: It is a knee-slapper.

85
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:19,346
LIAM: That's me. That's me.

86
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:29,765
TRAVIS: Is it really funny, or is it (singing) All
around me are familiar faces. I'll put that one in

87
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,482
for you on my playlist.

88
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:34,546
MATT: It was an awesome playlist, give you even
further insight as to the growth of Vax's

89
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:38,652
character over this past year. We have the next
one coming up-- is it yours, Keyleth?

90
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:39,955
MARISHA: It's mine!

91
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:43,513
MATT: Yeah, we have Keyleth's coming up next. Hell
yeah. We'll be seeing that on the Geek and Sundry

92
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:45,526
website, so keep an eye out for that.

93
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:46,654
MARISHA: Tomorrow.

94
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:48,006
MATT: Indeed.

95
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:52,331
LIAM: Tell you what, if I have a super-funny year,
I'll make a super-funny playlist.

96
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:53,561
TRAVIS: Yes!

97
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:59,853
MATT: They just announced it today, for those
who've been keeping along with Force Grey, which

98
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:05,755
we did earlier this year with Dungeons and Dragons
and Nerdist, we finished out on a cliffhanger, and

99
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:11,936
now we're going to be finalizing and finishing the
final episode on December 5th, live from the

100
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:18,001
Egyptian Theatre here in Hollywood. They put out a
cool poster today designed by the same artist who

101
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:24,143
did the Stranger Things cover, and you get to see
me Stranger Things-ified, I guess, if you would,

102
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,797
on the cover. You can check out either my Twitter
or the official Dungeons and Dragons Twitter for

103
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,003
more information on that as it comes out by
December 5th, it will also be livestreamed, so if

104
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:36,516
you can't be there in person, it will be available
on the internet via Twitch for you to watch live,

105
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:41,313
at your leisure. Looking forward to that, and hope
you check it out and like it.

106
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:47,516
And last but not least, next week is Thanksgiving.
We will not be having an episode next week,

107
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:52,279
because we're all going to probably be with our
families and out of town and eating a lot of food

108
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,788
and enjoying the tryptophan. Hope you are doing
the same. We'll miss you guys next week but we'll

109
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:02,936
be back the week after at the beginning of
December for the rest of this absolute basket of chaos.

110
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:06,705
LAURA: It'll be good. It'll be at a restart, when
we all die.

111
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:09,433
MATT: Yeah. It'll give you two weeks to build your
characters, great!

112
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:15,576
LIAM: Thanksgiving, we can be thanksful. We can be
thanksful for the campaign we hads, the

113
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:20,290
characters we hads, it'll be greats.

114
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,466
TRAVIS: Plurals all around.

115
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:30,873
MATT: Without further ado, let's go and jump into
tonight's episode of Critical Role!

116
00:08:30,873 --> 00:09:59,186
[dramatic music]

117
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:06,214
MATT: And welcome back. As we last left off, Vox
Machina, in their trek to take down the Chroma

118
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:11,638
Conclave, have been acquiring the Vestiges of
Divergence, ancient artifacts from a long-ago

119
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:17,883
historical battle. They've gathered most each and
every one, with one final one remaining. They

120
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:25,181
pushed the timeline for their encounter with the
Chroma Conclave forward at a rapid pace, and in

121
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:28,801
the process of getting ready for this final
encounter with Thordak, The Cinder King, the

122
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:34,359
great, swollen, powerful ancient red dragon who
lords over Emon and Tal'Dorei, you took a trip to

123
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:39,065
the Fire Elemental Plane to retrieve the final
Vestige known as the Plate of the Dawnmartyr for

124
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:42,108
your fantastic gnome cleric, Pike.

125
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:49,215
Upon making your way there to the City of Brass, a
very tyrannical society and a large, ancient city

126
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:58,967
run by efreet, you encountered some interesting
characters in Senokir and Uten, a fire genasi and

127
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:04,937
a tiefling. Two partnered jewelers that brought
you into their establishment, decided to help you

128
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:13,525
out, threw you in chains to give the image of you
being slaves to his business. Brought you guys to

129
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:18,757
speak to a number of the currently free fire giants in
the city, as apparently the armor belonged or was

130
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:20,221
won by a fire giant.

131
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:25,531
You managed to, upon asking one named Whaska, got
the information and sent you to Juuraiel, a gambler

132
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,334
and very well-off fire giant, one of the few
responsible for selling the rest of their

133
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:34,297
people into slavery here within the City of Brass,
in which a card game was not won.

134
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:37,275
SAM: It was this close!

135
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,130
MATT: This close every single time!

136
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,339
SAM: Yeah!

137
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:45,212
MATT: That was kind of absurd. However, you were
given the option, as opposed to now having sold

138
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:49,039
yourselves into slavery to the giant, to instead
do this grand favor for them. Apparently, the

139
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:57,513
past lover of this giant was killed in the streets
by a pit fiend named Ghurrix who occasionally

140
00:11:57,513 --> 00:12:02,236
wanders the slave district called the Arches here
in the City of Brass. You agreed to go find and

141
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:08,159
kill this pit fiend out of vengeance for the giant
and as such you would be freed from your current

142
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,345
onus and be given the armor that is in the
possession of Juuraiel, this giant, as well, so

143
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:21,500
everything should be great. You guys applied a
Seeming enchantment across the party, allowing

144
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,223
most of you to look kind of like copies of Vex and
Vax, the sexy sextuplets, as you put it. The kind

145
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:34,935
of things you'd want to purchase. Made your way to
the slave market called the Arches, with Scanlan

146
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:45,141
Shorthalt disguised as a flame-wreathed azer, a
Fire Plane dwarf. You proceeded to try and sell

147
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:52,437
this party to the pit fiend, Ghurrix, as he walked
through the area. After acquiring and purchasing

148
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:58,697
two celestial-blooded boys who were on another
slavery block.

149
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,464
LIAM: Altar boys.

150
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:06,115
MATT: That's disgusting. Bait. And it was bait and
it's worked out well so far as it got the

151
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:10,179
attention of the pit fiend. The pit fiend wandered
to where you had set the entrance to your

152
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:16,459
mansion, Scanlan. Upon some conversation,
seemingly were unable to convince the pit fiend to

153
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:25,186
suddenly step into this unsafe, spectral doorway
that you had attempted to coax him into. As many

154
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:31,231
of you emerged into the street, with Pike and
Percy hiding within the mansion, the rest of you

155
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:37,614
set the stage here at the mouth of this alleyway,
the nearby bubbling of a lava stream just off to

156
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:44,600
the right side of you. Keyleth, hidden in the back
of the alleyway, decided that, while this moment

157
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,180
was still tense, to use the element of surprise
and attempted to Feeblemind the pit fiend.

158
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,970
Unfortunately, it was resisted by the creature,
who then, as an instinctive reaction, summoned a

159
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:02,302
friend known as an erinyes from the Nine Hells to
join Ghurrix at his side. And that is where we

160
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:06,152
left off. We're going to bring up some boss music
here.

161
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:08,103
LIAM: Props to that set, though.

162
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:10,956
LAURA: This set is amazing.

163
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:16,620
MATT: Seeing as how we're in the Fire Elemental
Plane, I think it's important that we have some

164
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,447
proper Fire Elemental Plane lighting.

165
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:26,114
LIAM: Ghurrix, would you like to phone a friend?

166
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:29,801
MATT: Would you like to phone a friend? That's not
going to help.

167
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:32,520
MARISHA: So the blue thing is the magical door?

168
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:40,351
MATT: To give you guys some context, set-wise.
This is the doorway, the entrance to Scanlan's

169
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:45,267
mansion. Big as the doorway you could have made.
Back here is Keyleth, who had fired off the spell.

170
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:52,194
Here we have Vex and Trinket, who you had popped
out, as well as Vax, who had just stepped out of

171
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:54,534
the portal. Scanlan, with in front of you, the two
boys.

172
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:57,975
LAURA: In front of him?! They were in front of
him?

173
00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,764
SAM: We were sending them off to be sold.

174
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,110
LAURA: Yeah, but I thought you were holding out
the chain and they were standing behind you.

175
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,156
SAM: No, I was holding the chain and they stepped
forward.

176
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:09,754
MATT: And Grog was off here to the side. Here we
have Ghurrix himself as well as his ally companion

177
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:14,449
and a number of other slavers and/or slaves that
currently line the streets as part of this, who

178
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:17,613
are now watching as this conflict may seem to
erupt here.

179
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:24,071
SAM: Narrator slash Dungeon Master? What are those
guards? There's guards in the city.

180
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:27,411
LAURA: I looked for them the last game, and
they're not around right now.

181
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,704
MATT: There are efreet. You didn't see any around
at the moment, no. And they are called the

182
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:31,753
Illuminated.

183
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:33,448
TRAVIS: Does his companion have a name?

184
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:36,292
MATT: You don't know. You can certainly ask.

185
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:42,646
LIAM: And what's behind the pit fiend where the
map disappears? Is there building there or what?

186
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:48,318
MATT: There is an edge to a building there and
part of a thoroughfare walkway.

187
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:50,110
LIAM: How many stories is the building behind
them?

188
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,031
MATT: I'd say probably two stories.

189
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:58,795
SAM: Is that building made of sharp spikes that if
we destroyed the building it would kill the bad guy?

190
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:03,065
MATT: Probably not. However, I would like to ask
you all to roll initiative.

191
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:06,776
SAM: A lot going on this roll.

192
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:16,483
MARISHA: Oh, natural 20! I don't know what to do
with that in this situation.

193
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:24,129
MATT: All righty, so looking at how things stand
here, currently, 25 to 20?

194
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,745
MARISHA: 22.

195
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,753
LAURA: 24.

196
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,113
MATT: 24, okay.

197
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,505
LAURA: I rolled for Pike, too. Is that right?

198
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:34,036
MATT: Yeah. What's Pike's roll?

199
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,966
LAURA: She's going to kill me.

200
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:45,053
MATT: Natural one? So Pike is at the bottom.
Rolling in character for her. That's great. Great.

201
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,243
20 to 15?

202
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:48,364
LIAM: 19.

203
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:51,688
TRAVIS: Also 19. Yeah, baby.

204
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:55,332
LAURA: But you know what? That'll give her more
time to get into the game.

205
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:59,164
MATT: Hold on, so Grog and Vax 19. Percy?

206
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:00,188
TALIESIN: 18.

207
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:01,415
MATT: 18?

208
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:04,837
TALIESIN: It's not good for me.

209
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:10,832
MATT: All right, Scanlan, what did you get?

210
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:12,083
SAM: 13.

211
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,177
MATT: 13.

212
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:14,959
SAM: I'll be dead by the time I go.

213
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:22,404
MATT: Perfect. Given that standpoint, we are at
the top of the combat round. You watch as the pit

214
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:28,790
fiend's wings unfurl. The jaw clenches as the
fangs, now protruding from underneath its demonic

215
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,550
visage, it looks past all of you into the
alleyway, the source of the magic that seemed to

216
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:42,073
affect it now its current intent. The other, the
devilish female that stepped through the brief

217
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:47,375
portal, her wings unfurled, floating gently off
the ground, holding the longsword in one hand, a

218
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:53,951
longbow strewn over her shoulder, and some sort of
strange wound rope or lasso on her belt side.

219
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:59,334
Fully armored, now looking intently as to what her
next target is going to be. Vex, you are at the top.

220
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,447
LAURA: I'm the top?

221
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,629
MATT: You're the top. 24!

222
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:06,328
LAURA: Oh Jesus. Oh my god. Okay.

223
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:07,799
MARISHA: What are we doing?

224
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,466
LAURA: Number one, I'm going to yell at the boys
to run back into the mansion.

225
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,725
MATT: Okay.

226
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:26,068
LAURA: (nervous laughter) I hadn't thought this
much yet because I didn't know I was going to be

227
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:35,267
first. I'm going to-- Homina, homina. I'm going to
Hunter's Mark.

228
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,994
MATT: Hunter's Mark?

229
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:38,499
LAURA: The pit fiend.

230
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:39,980
MATT: All righty.

231
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,133
TRAVIS: Ghorrix?

232
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,193
MATT: Ghurrix.

233
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:58,317
LAURA: And I have a question. If I do the Bramble
Shot, does it do the damage straight up, and then

234
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:00,280
if they do the strength save then it doesn't--

235
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,173
MATT: Correct. You still have to roll to hit, but
then when it hits, it does the damage, and then

236
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:05,110
the strength save is to see if it's restrained or
not.

237
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:16,541
LAURA: Okay. So I'm going to tell Trinket to move
up next to him.

238
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:25,189
MATT: Okay, Trinket rushes through. Trinket comes
charging upward. (roars)

239
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:30,456
LAURA: Yeah, and can I do Bramble Shot as one of
my attacks and then do another regular attack? Is

240
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:31,787
that the way it works?

241
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,080
MATT: What's it say for the specific ability?

242
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,332
LAURA: It just says Bramble Shot.

243
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:36,001
MATT: So yeah, one of your attacks would be a
Bramble Shot.

244
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,875
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to do the Bramble
Shot on it.

245
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,963
MATT: All right, go for it.

246
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:41,830
LAURA: Okay, that doesn't work.

247
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,445
MATT: What did you roll?

248
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:44,392
LAURA: A one.

249
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,622
MATT: A natural one again?

250
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:46,693
LAURA: Two ones.

251
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,229
TRAVIS: Where's your dice jail?

252
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,561
LAURA: I don't know. The dice jail was in the
thing; it's not here!

253
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:56,900
MATT: Bramble Shot goes wide, swooping past it and
slamming into the building behind it. You watch as

254
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,371
the arrow explodes and a series of vines tangle
outward and wrap around the side of the building.

255
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:04,241
LAURA: Cool. This is off to a really awesome
start.

256
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:05,695
TRAVIS: Come on, captain, let's go.

257
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:08,240
LAURA: I'm going to just try to shoot him.

258
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
MATT: All right.

259
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,217
LAURA: 25?

260
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:12,505
MATT: All righty.

261
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:13,580
LAURA: Does that hit him?

262
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,789
MATT: 25 hits, yeah.

263
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:33,056
LAURA: Okay, good. 14, 16, 17, 18, plus 2d6
because Trinket's standing next to him. 25.

264
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:48,360
MATT: 25 damage. All right. You already used your
bonus action to Hunter's Mark, so he cannot. All

265
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,658
right. Do you wish to move?

266
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:54,218
LAURA: Yes. I want to back up into the alley.

267
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:55,639
MATT: Okay.

268
00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:01,679
LAURA: Can I hide behind that building right
there? In that little crevice?

269
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,465
MATT: Yeah, you can go ahead and dive into that
little alcove there.

270
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,338
LAURA: Okay.

271
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:10,160
MATT: I'll put you just slightly in there. And
there you are. You're not quite hidden but you're

272
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,447
peeking around the side.

273
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:14,344
LAURA: How many feet away am I from them?

274
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:16,167
MATT: From Ghurrix?

275
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,415
LAURA: From Trinket.

276
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:23,627
MATT: Oh, from Trinket you are roughly 40. A
little over 40 feet away. All right?

277
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:24,884
LAURA: Thank you.

278
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,512
MATT: No worries. That's your turn. Keyleth, you're
up.

279
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:28,725
LAURA: My shitty turn!

280
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:31,261
SAM: That was great. You killed him.

281
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:35,182
MARISHA: Where's his friend that he summoned?

282
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:36,512
MATT: Right next to him.

283
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:37,901
MARISHA: The little winged thing?

284
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:39,947
SAM: Yeah, it's like a parrot on a pirate's
shoulder.

285
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:46,274
MARISHA: Okay, and this guy over here, who's like
(growls). Is he angry at us, too?

286
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:52,154
MATT: No. He's currently standing next to this
block with a slave that's in chains that it's

287
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:55,541
holding the chain to and was in the middle of
barking before all of a sudden it watched this

288
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,549
summoning happen.

289
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,050
MARISHA: Okay, so he's just like "Fight!" Okay.

290
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,941
MATT: He's looking over right now and watching
curiously about what's going down.

291
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:06,213
MARISHA: Is the pit fiend considered huge or
large?

292
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:07,166
MATT: Large.

293
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,203
MARISHA: Large.

294
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,311
SAM: And in charge.

295
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:19,255
MARISHA: Okay, and then this is lava? Oh Jesus.
I'm shaking. Okay. I'm going to cast Watery Sphere

296
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,082
right on their faces.

297
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:25,342
SAM: Just get them all wet. Go (blubs).

298
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:28,500
MATT: Watery Sphere.

299
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,458
MARISHA: They both have to make strength saving
throws.

300
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,463
SAM: Or else they're wet? What happens?

301
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,783
MARISHA: Or else they are restrained.

302
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:38,577
SAM: Ooh, in water.

303
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:39,740
MARISHA: In water.

304
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,392
MATT: All right. So we'll use this as the Watery
Sphere.

305
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:47,915
We'll set it facing right there. All right.
What's the save they have to make?

306
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:50,394
MARISHA: Strength.

307
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:53,547
MATT: Both of them have to make a strength saving
throw. All righty.

308
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:56,173
MARISHA: I'm so nervous!

309
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:59,516
MATT: That is a 21 for the pit fiend. What's the
DC?

310
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:00,681
MARISHA: 19.

311
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:02,087
MATT: 19, so it succeeds.

312
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:03,814
TRAVIS: That was strength, too?

313
00:23:03,814 --> 00:23:11,508
MATT: The erinyes makes an eight. She does not
succeed. While the sphere seems to splatter and

314
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:16,833
try and encompass the pit fiend, it is unaffected
by the torrent of water. However, the winged

315
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:20,595
erinyes, who's floating in the air, seems to be
pulled into it and is now thrashing about within

316
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:21,846
the water itself.

317
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,100
LAURA: Good job.

318
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,465
MARISHA: Can I now move it now?

319
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,227
MATT: You conjure the sphere--

320
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:34,875
MARISHA: It says as an action I can move the
sphere up to 30 feet.

321
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:46,828
MATT: From what I can see right here, no. You
create the sphere and they are restrained, and

322
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:49,365
then future turns, as an action, you can move it.

323
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:51,024
MARISHA: Okay.

324
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,452
SAM: Nice!

325
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:54,169
MARISHA: It's restrained.

326
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,821
SAM: You got some bonus shit to do?

327
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,217
MARISHA: Not right now. I'm going to wait.

328
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:00,818
TRAVIS: You got some bonus shit to do?

329
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:03,503
SAM: Yo, you got some bonus shit?

330
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:05,497
MATT: You know, some bonus shit?

331
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:07,682
MARISHA: On my good days, I always have bonus shit
to do.

332
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,096
MATT: Is that your turn? Are you going to move?

333
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:18,916
MARISHA: Can I hug around the corner a little?
Hide a bit?

334
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,224
MATT: Sure.

335
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,115
MARISHA: Just a little tuck in. Yeah, that's good.
That's good. I don't want to like lose too much

336
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,377
visual. Yeah, that's good.

337
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:26,569
MATT: All righty.

338
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,212
MARISHA: Yep.

339
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:31,175
MATT: All right, that end your turn? All right,
that brings us to Vax.

340
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:32,689
LIAM: We're tied?

341
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:36,570
MATT: You're both tied. You and Grog are both at
the same initiative level, so you both go at the

342
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,370
same time, but it's up to you who goes first.

343
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,872
LIAM: Let the big man go first.

344
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:48,308
TRAVIS: I want to light this candle and get the
party started! I would like to fiery rage. And can

345
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:52,395
I bust out in a straight sprint towards the pit
fiend?

346
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:53,926
MATT: That you can.

347
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:58,737
TRAVIS: And in the immortal words of Bob Ross,
"Everybody needs a friend," and I want to give him

348
00:24:58,737 --> 00:25:03,242
a big fucking bear hug. And I would like to try and
grapple him, if I could.

349
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:05,326
MATT: Yes. We can totally do that.

350
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:08,773
TRAVIS: I can grapple a creature one size larger
than myself.

351
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,296
MATT: That you can.

352
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:12,636
MARISHA: Get these fuckers locked down.

353
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,907
LIAM: DND Bob Ross reference is like Playstation
trophies.

354
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:26,745
MATT: It's how it's supposed to be, man. Just
saying. Your grapple can replace an attack, as we

355
00:25:26,745 --> 00:25:29,252
said before. So go ahead and make a strength
athletics check.

356
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:31,534
TRAVIS: And I have advantage on these because I'm
raging.

357
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:32,966
MATT: Correct.

358
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:40,008
TRAVIS: 15, nine. 23.

359
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:46,662
MATT: 22. Moving up, you have him currently
grappled.

360
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,242
TRAVIS and LAURA: Great.

361
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,565
SAM: Okay.

362
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:50,964
MARISHA: They're both grappled.

363
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:52,917
SAM: Let's all leave except for Grog.

364
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:56,662
TRAVIS: That replaces an attack?

365
00:25:56,662 --> 00:26:00,795
MATT: You currently have him grappled with your
arm right now.

366
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:03,850
SAM: We'll tell your story, Grog.

367
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:10,694
TRAVIS: Can I revisit the days of the Crucible and
can I try and suplex this motherfucker onto his side?

368
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,364
MATT: You know what, sure. Why not?

369
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:17,626
TRAVIS: I want to! Just to get him prone, also.

370
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:21,064
MATT: Yeah, because currently I'd say for the
purposes of the grapple, because it takes you all

371
00:26:21,064 --> 00:26:23,826
of your strength to do so, you would not be able to
attack with your axe while you have him grappled.

372
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:33,475
That wouldn't function. You have him grappled. Go
ahead and make another athletics check.

373
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,120
TRAVIS: Okay.

374
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,278
LIAM: Get it girl. Get it.

375
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:39,887
TRAVIS: 19.

376
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:49,392
MATT: He rolled a 17 plus eight. So that is a 25,
so no. As you attempt to lift, these giant devil

377
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:55,858
claws jam into the side of your shoulders. And as
the pain hits, it forces you down, and you can't

378
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:58,703
get enough lift. His wings are just too big. He's
too dense.

379
00:26:58,703 --> 00:27:00,903
TRAVIS: But I'm still giving him love, right?

380
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:03,472
MATT: You're still holding onto him. All righty.

381
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:04,805
TRAVIS: That ends my turn.

382
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:05,997
MATT: All right, that ends Grog's turn.

383
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:07,768
LIAM: Okay, I'm standing right in front of Scanlan.
Right?

384
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:10,104
MATT: Yes, you are. Well, you're right next to
him.

385
00:27:10,104 --> 00:27:12,986
LIAM: Right next to him? All right, I'm going to
take my hand and palm him by the face and cast

386
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:19,252
Heroism on him. That's the first action. First,
I'm going click my Boots of Haste. Which they've

387
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:25,943
seen me for the last 30 minutes. We slept. I put
my boots on. I've not been invisible all day. I

388
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:32,398
slap my hand on his face, cast Heroism, then I
cast it on myself, then I'm going to take to the

389
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:39,489
air and fly up and over them and behind them and
hover over the building behind them. Maybe we

390
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:44,385
should just imagine it, because I want to go
off the table. And throw Whisper at the back of

391
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:51,086
his fucking head from about 40 feet in the air.
Directly behind him.

392
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,602
MATT: Back that way? We'll say for the purposes of
this, you're back behind him.

393
00:27:55,602 --> 00:27:56,970
LIAM: All right.

394
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,889
MATT: Okay, so how far up did you fly?

395
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:06,520
LIAM: I'm going to do 50 feet. Above his head,
back a little bit, and right into his head. That

396
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:13,948
diagonal line is probably just the edge of 60. And
since Grog is hugging him, it's sneak attack, and

397
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:24,736
he's grappled, which means I have advantage, so it
is 25. Which should hit if I was paying attention

398
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:39,439
to the ACs. Two, we'll say is ten, plus the sneak
attack damage is 15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 31, 35 plus

399
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:46,082
the psychic damage. 35 plus-- I need an eight.
Somebody give me an eight. Where's an eight? 38.

400
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:55,137
MATT: 38, gotcha. All right, that ends your turn?

401
00:28:55,137 --> 00:29:03,215
LIAM: No, then I'm going to fly an additional--
because I'm hasted, I can go 120 feet. I'm going

402
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:06,887
to go up another 40 feet. No. I'm going to stay
where I am. Stay where I am.

403
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:10,366
SAM: Am I heroic now? What does that mean? What do
I do?

404
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:14,964
LIAM: Every round, because my charisma bonus is
not that high, you get two hit points every round.

405
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:17,839
SAM: I add two hit points to myself?

406
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,683
LIAM: You get them back. Yeah. Do they go up?

407
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:23,659
SAM: I get two hit points back.

408
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:29,502
LIAM: Temporary hit points. Yeah. They go up. Does
he get them now, or does it start next round?

409
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:32,402
MATT: Let me go look up your spell.

410
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:35,160
LIAM: The wording is unclear on my card.

411
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,224
MATT: Until the spell ends, the creature is immune
to being frightened and gains temporary hit points

412
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:42,256
equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the
start of each of its turns. At the start of your

413
00:29:42,256 --> 00:29:44,688
turn, you get--

414
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:46,165
LIAM: Two. Just two.

415
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:51,630
SAM: And I'm immune to fright. (cackles) Like
always.

416
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:57,528
MATT: Basically. All righty. That ends your turn.
Percy, you're up. You're currently inside

417
00:29:57,528 --> 00:30:02,474
Scanlan's mansion. Last thing you saw was Scanlan
reach out and go "Fucking jenga!" and then

418
00:30:02,474 --> 00:30:04,385
disappear back into the doorway.

419
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:09,710
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to look out the door.
What do I see when I look out the door?

420
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:16,452
MATT: You look out the door. You see the two
chained celestial-blooded boys standing there

421
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:21,069
looking confused and frightened. You see Scanlan
holding their chains from behind currently

422
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:27,774
glancing up as Vax has darted off, winged, and has
begun throwing daggers from the air 50 feet up and

423
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:31,490
behind where the pit fiend is. That's what you
see.

424
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:43,543
TALIESIN: I'm going to take some shots from inside
the mansion at the pit fiend, and then I'm going

425
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:45,419
to duck away from the door again.

426
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,488
LAURA: Best place to be right now.

427
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:52,288
TALIESIN: I'm not going to step out of the
doorway. I'm going to step in. I'm in the doorway still.

428
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:56,207
MATT: Sure. Your hand is out of the doorway.
Cool. Go for it.

429
00:30:56,207 --> 00:31:04,382
TALIESIN: Very specific about that. Here we go.
First shot. Oh, before I do anything, I'm going to

430
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:16,802
cast Hex on the pit demon, giving him a strength
disadvantage.

431
00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:19,257
MATT: Okay. Strength ability checks.

432
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:28,462
TALIESIN: And here we go. First shot. Oh god.
Don't do anything stupid. Okay. That's fine. 22 to hit.

433
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:29,855
MATT: 22 hits.

434
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:33,949
LAURA: I was like (heavy breathing).

435
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,793
TALIESIN: I am so not together.

436
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:41,678
SAM: Guys, we're winning! He hasn't even done
anything. He's pretty weak. He's just sitting

437
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:43,633
there, taking it. Just sitting there.

438
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:47,000
TRAVIS: That red light on Matt's face is so
telling.

439
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,028
LAURA: You're too scary right now, Matt

440
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:50,854
TRAVIS: Don't raise your eyebrows like that.

441
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:53,213
LAURA: Yeah. Don't intentionally look scary.

442
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:59,483
TALIESIN: That's not bad. That's 15 points of
damage, plus six points of psychic, plus four

443
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:01,079
points of necrotic damage.

444
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:04,701
MATT: Okay. 15 plus four?

445
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,236
TALIESIN: 15 plus six plus four.

446
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:07,691
MATT: Okay, good.

447
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:18,706
TALIESIN: Next shot. Let's go Sharpshooter. See
what happens. Yay. 26 to hit.

448
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,673
MATT: 26 hits. Yep.

449
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:30,032
TALIESIN: I'm shaking more than normal. Oh, that's
good. Oh shit. That's really good.

450
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,449
MARISHA: That's a Percy roll.

451
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:40,332
TALIESIN: Holy fuck, that's a Percy roll. 26
points of damage, four points of psychic damage,

452
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:46,791
and six points of necrotic damage. That's
stacking. I'm not breaking it up. All of these are stacked.

453
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,365
MATT: All righty. Good.

454
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:51,453
TALIESIN: Because I don't know if the necrotic and
the psychic are doing full damage to him, so I'm

455
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:54,206
trying to break them up for you. I'm going to do
that again.

456
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,851
LIAM: Magic guns are dangerous.

457
00:32:55,851 --> 00:33:05,703
TALIESIN: (laughs) And here we go for the final
roll for this attack. Pew pew. And that's

458
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:09,781
again. That's really good. That's 29 to hit.

459
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:10,935
MATT: That hits.

460
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,206
TALIESIN: I do not do that crit thing now. Not
yet.

461
00:33:13,206 --> 00:33:17,042
MATT: Not yet. First round is going good for you
guys.

462
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:23,084
TALIESIN: This is also good. That's 28 points of
normal damage, five points of psychic and three

463
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,360
points of necrotic.

464
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,861
MATT: What was it again?

465
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:35,329
TALIESIN: 28 points of normal damage. Five points
of psychic damage. Three points of necrotic

466
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:41,535
damage. And now I'm going to hide behind. I'm
going to like spin around and get inside the

467
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:43,229
doorway and back the fuck off.

468
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:48,542
MATT: Okay. Good to know. That ends Percy's turn.
That brings us to the pit fiend.

469
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:50,907
SAM: Pit fiend's turn.

470
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,128
MATT: Let's see here.

471
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:56,545
LIAM: Let's see here, how can I kill them? Kill
them all at once. Kill them one at a time. Kill

472
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:59,491
them in an embarrassing way.

473
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:04,637
TRAVIS: Don't. No. Leave the book out. There's a
rule that says you can't look at the book once

474
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:06,739
your turn has started.

475
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:08,714
LIAM: Cut the feed. Cut the feed!

476
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:13,449
MATT: Silly grapple. Okay.

477
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,528
TRAVIS: Don't move. He can't see us if we don't
move.

478
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:23,868
MATT: Even with disadvantage, that is an athletics
check of 25. I need you to make an athletics check.

479
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:26,637
MARISHA and LAURA: Come on, Grog.

480
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:31,012
TRAVIS: Nope. 22.

481
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:39,387
MATT: It bursts out of your grasp and takes up in
the air with its giant wings. You do get an attack

482
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:43,322
of opportunity on it. As does Trinket, actually.

483
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:49,438
TRAVIS: I'm going to make it a reckless attack,
Great Weapon Master.

484
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:51,895
LAURA: Can you do that on a reaction?

485
00:34:51,895 --> 00:34:53,823
TRAVIS: On any of them.

486
00:34:53,823 --> 00:35:02,573
MARISHA: What, is he coming for me? That looks
like that's what's happening.

487
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:04,121
LIAM: That's fucked up.

488
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:07,877
TRAVIS: Where did he go? Oh.

489
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:13,026
MATT: It (whoosh) in the air. It's actually going
to stay about--

490
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:17,412
MARIHSA: It's coming for us.

491
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:19,002
LAURA: Why?

492
00:35:19,002 --> 00:35:23,011
MARISHA: I tried to make him stupid and I'm sure
he realizes that.

493
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:29,685
MATT: Let's say about 15 feet up about there.

494
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:31,426
LAURA: Fuck.

495
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:36,798
MATT: That's all he can do with his turn because
of the trying to break out of the grapple.

496
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:38,782
LAURA: Do you have time to move?

497
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:40,178
MATT: How much damage is that?

498
00:35:40,178 --> 00:35:41,444
TRAVIS: I didn't roll damage yet.

499
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:42,658
MATT: Oh what was your roll to hit?

500
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,470
TRAVIS: Great Weapon Master, reckless. I waited to
roll.

501
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,115
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

502
00:35:46,115 --> 00:35:50,795
TRAVIS: That's better. 32 minus five is--

503
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:54,688
MATT: 27. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

504
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:56,096
TRAVIS: Okay.

505
00:35:56,096 --> 00:36:03,067
LAURA: Trinket rolled 21.

506
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,439
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll.

507
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,530
LAURA: Is that a bite?

508
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,386
TRAVIS: 36 with the Great Weapon Master.

509
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:14,717
LAURA: Is it a bite attack or claw attack? Do I
get to choose?

510
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:16,244
MATT: I'll let you choose.

511
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:19,920
LAURA: It's a bite attack.

512
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,480
TRAVIS: His carefree manner worries me.

513
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,834
LAURA: It's 13.

514
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:33,419
MATT: 13. All right. Trinket as he bites upward,
it doesn't do anywhere near the impact you think

515
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:36,993
it would even for a nice solid bite. It seems to
be resistant to Trinket's damage.

516
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:42,222
LAURA: To piercing damage? To bear damage?

517
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:44,797
MATT: Half damage from bears.

518
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:46,774
TRAVIS: Was he resistant to my slashing damage?

519
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:47,833
MATT: No.

520
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,767
LAURA: What? It must be piercing.

521
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:52,198
TRAVIS: I do have a magic weapon.

522
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:57,406
MATT: That ends Ghurrix's turn. All right, that
brings us now to the erinyes. The erinyes is going

523
00:36:57,406 --> 00:37:00,008
to attempt to escape.

524
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:02,343
MARIHSA: Strength saving throw, bitch.

525
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:28,432
MATT: That's a 17 plus four. That's 21. Breaks
free of the sphere. Erinyes, which can go 60 feet

526
00:37:28,432 --> 00:37:46,451
up, is going to fly up onto the rooftop there.
Your sphere is left there on the ground. However,

527
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:58,322
wasted the action to try and break through. All right.
That ends their turns. The two celestial boys try

528
00:37:58,322 --> 00:38:01,045
and pull against the chains. Do you let go or do
you hold them there?

529
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,443
SAM: I let go.

530
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:05,240
MATT: Okay. They both run this way.

531
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,278
LAURA: No. I meant in the mansion!

532
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:10,249
MATT: Do you yell this as they 
start to run way?

533
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:13,866
LAURA: I said yes. I meant in the mansion,
stupid.

534
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:17,665
MATT: Okay. They don't really know what the heck
is going on. I'm going to roll to see if they

535
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:23,881
recognize that in the panic. Okay. Both roll tens.
They both hear you, stop, turn, and bolt into the

536
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:25,069
mansion.

537
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,298
LAURA: Yay!

538
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:28,016
SAM: I don't let them in.

539
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:32,694
MATT: What a dick. What a dick move. All right,
Scanlan, you're up.

540
00:38:32,694 --> 00:38:36,983
LIAM: You get two hit points. Temporary hit points.

541
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:41,660
SAM: I'm doing better. I'm doing better than I was
before this fight started.

542
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,979
LIAM: Oh my gosh, I get to hit a hundred hit points
because of that spell. That's amazing.

543
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:50,006
SAM: How high up is the pit fiend?

544
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:52,926
MATT: 15 feet up off the ground, currently.

545
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:56,314
SAM: And how far away am I from him?

546
00:38:56,314 --> 00:39:05,142
MATT: You are currently... about 55 feet.

547
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,812
SAM: Oh shit.

548
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,538
MATT: 50 to 55 feet.

549
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,162
SAM: Can't even get close enough to do shit.

550
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:12,048
MATT: You can move.

551
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:18,877
SAM: I can move, but my move is nothing. It's 25.

552
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:22,695
MATT: Just so you know. Vax, you didn't get
temporary hit points.

553
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,498
LIAM: At the start of my next turn I do though,
don't I?

554
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,049
MATT: Did you cast it on yourself or on Scanlan?

555
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:30,116
LIAM: Both of us. Action, action, and the bonus
action was an attack. Hasted.

556
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:32,389
MATT: You can't have two concentration spells up
at the same time.

557
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:33,620
LIAM: Oh, it's a concentration spell?

558
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,850
MATT: Yes, it is.

559
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,895
LIAM: I'll leave it on Scanlan. Can I take a
secondary hit on him after the fact, since I was

560
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:41,501
unaware of the rules?

561
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:46,832
MATT: Sure. Because you're not used to casting
spells. Sure. I'll let you.

562
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:52,590
MARISHA: Technically, I thought you couldn't
cast-- I thought it doesn't work with spells. I

563
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,223
don't know.

564
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,468
SAM and MATT: What?

565
00:39:55,468 --> 00:40:00,405
MARISHA: Thought you couldn't just cast two spells.
It was only melee attacks--

566
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:03,108
LIAM: Right. Which is what he's saying.

567
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:09,259
MATT: One of them is concentration. Because it's
an action spell. One action from your haste spell

568
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:10,722
can only be used for a weapon attack.

569
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:14,450
LIAM: Right. And we had a text conversation
earlier today where I said that if I don't hold an

570
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,125
action, I can do this, this, and this, and we just
misunderstood each other.

571
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,101
MATT: Probably. That's totally fine. Sorry, I
misunderstood earlier and thought you were

572
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:22,714
just casting it on Scanlan. No worries.

573
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:26,330
LIAM: So keep the one on Scanlan, and I'm going to
roll. I would have rolled a secondary shitty

574
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,396
attack on him for 22.

575
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:29,753
MATT: Okay, that hits.

576
00:40:29,753 --> 00:40:35,540
LIAM: Okay. That is a massive nine hit points of
damage.

577
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:46,186
MATT: Boom. All righty. Great. So now it is Pike's
turn.

578
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:48,658
SAM: I haven't gone yet.

579
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:50,110
MATT: Oh, that's right.

580
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:56,208
SAM: Okay, I am too far away to do anything and
don't really want to get in closer. I will get a

581
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,695
little bit closer so I am in range to inspire
Keyleth.

582
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:02,085
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, man.

583
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:08,217
SAM: And I will inspire her with a randomly
selected limerick from this disgusting book that

584
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,486
Taliesin gave me.

585
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:10,885
TALIESIN: Oh, throw it at me. Okay.

586
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,791
SAM: Okay.

587
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,303
TALIESIN: Pick carefully.

588
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:17,173
SAM: They're all horrible.

589
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:18,628
TALIESIN: They are. Pick carefully.

590
00:41:18,628 --> 00:41:25,545
SAM: Okay, ready? Nope, that's disgusting. Wow.
Okay. Sure.

591
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:29,130
Maggie is such a sad sack of shit

592
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,283
That no one will tickle her tit.

593
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,311
It would make her so glad

594
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:35,765
To be had by a lad.

595
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:38,396
Her drawers cream at the thought of it?

596
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:42,092
Taliesin, what did you give me?!

597
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:44,094
TALIESIN: The only thing I knew you'd love.

598
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:47,221
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

599
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:50,716
MATT: Keyleth, do you want to take an inspiration
dice?

600
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,297
TRAVIS: It's like the Restricted Section of
Hogwarts.

601
00:41:53,297 --> 00:41:55,417
MARISHA: I wouldn't understand half of those
references.

602
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,074
LIAM: It's very in character.

603
00:41:57,074 --> 00:42:01,924
MATT: Keyleth would be like, "I like whipped
cream."

604
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:04,090
MARISHA: I love whipped cream. It's delicious.

605
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:09,157
MATT: There you go. So take your inspiration dice
in misunderstanding Scanlan's extremely gross

606
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:10,169
limerick.

607
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:13,000
TALIESIN: Don't you dare pin that on me. Don't you
fucking dare.

608
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,844
MATT: That's your bonus action. That's your
movement. What do you want for your action?

609
00:42:15,844 --> 00:42:18,210
LIAM: This is why we play the game.

610
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,332
TALIESIN: That was definitely a nice one that you
found. They get way worse.

611
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,287
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

612
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:34,340
SAM: I will cast Bigby's Hand! And make it an
Interposing Hand between Keyleth and the pit fiend.

613
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,476
MARISHA: Thanks, Scanlan.

614
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:39,267
MATT: All righty.

615
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:41,056
SAM: So now he'll just attack me instead.

616
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:52,379
MATT: Interposing Hand. You have half cover,
Keyleth, as Bigby's Hand is essentially giving you

617
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:57,345
some sort of armor bonus.

618
00:42:57,345 --> 00:43:02,393
SAM: Does it stop him from moving towards her? Is
that how it happens?

619
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:04,570
MATT: It gives her half cover.

620
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,929
SAM: It's like a wall.

621
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:08,587
MATT: Target can't move through the hand's space
if its strength score is less than or equal to the

622
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:09,454
hand's strength score.

623
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,171
SAM: Oh shit. It's probably super strong.

624
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,557
MATT: The hand's strength score is 26. It is
equal.

625
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:16,954
SAM: So what does that mean? It's a roll?

626
00:43:16,954 --> 00:43:18,684
MATT: So it can move through the hand.

627
00:43:18,684 --> 00:43:21,002
SAM: Shit! Well, that didn't do much.

628
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:27,673
MATT: Hold on. Oh, it's less or equal to. So no, it
cannot move through the hand. Sorry. I misread it.

629
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:31,199
Currently, if it tries to force its way through 
the hand, it's going to hold it in place.

630
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,994
MARISHA: Talk to the hand.

631
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:35,145
SAM: Yes.

632
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:38,930
MATT: There we go. All right. So that finishes
your turn? All right. Now it's Pike's turn.

633
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,586
LAURA: Oh. Okay. I'm controlling Pike right now.

634
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,478
MATT: Yes, you are. For the time being. Pike is
inside the mansion right now. She watched

635
00:43:45,478 --> 00:43:51,368
Percy step into the door frame, fire a few shots
out, and then duck right behind it again.

636
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:54,166
LAURA: Okay. So she's looking through the door.
What can she see?

637
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:59,460
MATT: Right now all she sees is Grog and Trinket
were attacking the pit fiend as it flew off, and

638
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,298
that's all she sees now is Grog and Trinket by
themselves outside on the street.

639
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:03,526
LAURA: Okay.

640
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:06,144
MATT: And this watery sphere that's floating in
space.

641
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:14,535
LAURA: Okay, she's going to step out of the door,
and she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

642
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:16,593
MATT: Okay, where is she going to cast it?

643
00:44:16,593 --> 00:44:27,353
LAURA: At fourth level. If she makes it an anvil, can
she knock him down to the ground?

644
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:30,764
MATT: (laughs) That's more of a flavor element.

645
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:37,079
LAURA: I want to make it barbed noose to go around
his neck.

646
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:44,784
MATT: Okay. In true Sarenrae fashion. All right.
So for the purposes of that we will say that this

647
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:46,975
glowing yellow--

648
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,680
LAURA: It's a yellow noose, so it looks
spiritual.

649
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,084
MATT: All righty. So we'll say that it's in the
same space as him where you conjure it. There. At

650
00:44:57,084 --> 00:45:07,337
a fourth level. So at fourth level, that means its
attacks do 4d8 plus five per hit. If it hits. Now

651
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:13,320
that it's landed, so you cast a spell, it makes a
melee attack. So go ahead and roll a d20, adding

652
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,573
ten to that.

653
00:45:14,573 --> 00:45:15,773
LAURA: 23?

654
00:45:15,773 --> 00:45:18,678
MATT: That hits, so go ahead and roll 4d8 plus
five.

655
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:27,391
LAURA: 26 points. And is that all the bonus?

656
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,058
MATT: That's all the bonus action.

657
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,214
LAURA: Okay, cool.

658
00:45:30,214 --> 00:45:33,459
MATT: She cannot cast any other spell, unless it's
second level or lower.

659
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:38,289
LAURA: Oh, okay. Is Beacon of Hope-- oh, it's
third level. Shit balls.

660
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:40,821
SAM: Can you please do this as Ashley, please?

661
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:47,446
LAURA: "Oh, okay! Oh, hold on!"

662
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:50,814
TALIESIN: That's actually really good.

663
00:45:50,814 --> 00:46:02,836
MATT: Things that are helpful: Aid. Let's see,
there is Prayer of Healing.

664
00:46:02,836 --> 00:46:07,031
LAURA: Okay, but nobody's hurt just yet. Spell
bolsters allies with toughness and resolve.

665
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:12,035
MARISHA: Doesn't she have an evil thing? An
anti-evil-people-thing? No?

666
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,728
TRAVIS: Anti-evil-people.

667
00:46:13,728 --> 00:46:21,528
MATT: Let us all cross our fingers that Blindspot
finishes that thing they're shooting soon and she

668
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,876
comes back to us.

669
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:27,265
SAM: She just texted!

670
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:29,104
LAURA: Oh, did she? What did she say?

671
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:33,043
SAM: She said, "I have a power that kills all evil
people around me."

672
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:35,279
LAURA: Oh, good! I want to do that!

673
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:37,085
MATT: That's not how that works.

674
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,444
MARISHA: But there's a radius blast thing.

675
00:46:39,444 --> 00:46:41,568
LAURA: Radius blast, but that's not a second level or
lower.

676
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:46,453
MATT: You know what, we'll say for the purposes of
this, if you want to cast Aid on somebody,

677
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:49,131
otherwise, right now, you'll have to miss the
turn. Because we have to keep this going.

678
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:53,641
LAURA: Oh god, okay, fine! I'll do Aid, I guess.
Why not?

679
00:46:53,641 --> 00:47:00,497
MATT: Okay. Up to three creatures within 30 feet.
Their maximum hit points increase by five.

680
00:47:00,497 --> 00:47:07,530
LAURA: Okay, that's going to be huge. So the only
people that are in range are Trinket, Grog, and me.

681
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,254
MATT: And Scanlan, technically.

682
00:47:09,254 --> 00:47:11,043
TALIESIN: And, technically, me.

683
00:47:11,043 --> 00:47:14,772
MATT: Grog, Pike, and Scanlan would all work if
you wanted to do that.

684
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:21,606
LAURA: So Grog, Pike, and Scanlan. You don't need
it, though. Do you need it? I'm going to go

685
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:22,681
Trinket--

686
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:26,393
MATT: Or you could do Channel Divinity, if you
prefer that. No, it hasn't been seven days, so she

687
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:30,268
can't do it yet. Since the Vorugal battle.

688
00:47:30,268 --> 00:47:32,600
LAURA: Okay, Trinket, Scanlan, and Pike.

689
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,669
MATT: Trinket, Scanlan, and Pike. So that's five
additional hit points to Trinket's maximum, to

690
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:38,709
Scanlan's maximum, and to Pike's.

691
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:40,691
LAURA: And then Pike's going to run back in the
door.

692
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:45,753
MATT: Okay, and then Pike darts back in. There you
go. All right, that ends the first round of

693
00:47:45,753 --> 00:47:52,789
combat. Next round, I'll actually be able to do
some things. Vex, you're up. At the top of your

694
00:47:52,789 --> 00:48:03,467
turn, as you glance up, you can see (whooshing)
this hellish devil creature. Its presence itself

695
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:06,953
quakes you to the core. I need you to roll a
wisdom saving throw.

696
00:48:06,953 --> 00:48:17,001
LAURA: Okay. Oh, okay! Plus five, what is that?
23.

697
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:23,009
MATT: 23, okay. You manage to resist the
creature's fearful aura.

698
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:24,310
LAURA: Thank god!

699
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,868
TRAVIS: Holy shit, aura?

700
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:27,961
MATT: Yeah. You may take the rest of your turn.

701
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:34,218
LAURA: Okay, good! Okay, I've already tried the
Bramble Shot. It's gone now. Then I'm going to

702
00:48:34,218 --> 00:48:42,495
attack him a couple times. That was a one and a
30.

703
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,657
MATT: 30 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

704
00:48:44,657 --> 00:48:46,165
LIAM: Man, your jail is full tonight.

705
00:48:46,165 --> 00:49:02,413
LAURA: The jail is full! I'm out of dice. I have
to go through my bag again. 21. And then I'm going

706
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:13,563
to move into the mansion. No! Yes, I'm going to
move into the mansion. No! Okay. Yeah, I'm going

707
00:49:13,563 --> 00:49:17,265
to move into the mansion. What? He's whispering at
me.

708
00:49:17,265 --> 00:49:22,857
MATT: You vanish inside the mansion. All righty!

709
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:29,876
LAURA: Trinket licks Grog.

710
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:34,219
TRAVIS: Not now! Aw, there's always time for
lick.

711
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:43,586
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? Keyleth. Top
of your turn, even with the Hand there, the

712
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:47,856
creature's size is so large and voluminous by
comparison to it, and you see it's still trained

713
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:50,041
on you. I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

714
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:58,975
MARISHA: (whimpering) Okay. Oh, that's not bad.
21.

715
00:49:58,975 --> 00:50:08,079
MATT: 21? Just succeeds. You guys are rolling real
well tonight. It's frustrating me.

716
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,617
TALIESIN: Don't make that face!

717
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:12,417
TRAVIS: More than the beholder fight?

718
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:19,299
MATT: It's on par. But we've only just begun.
Continue. What are you doing, Keyleth?

719
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:25,586
MARISHA: Oh my god. Okay. My water sphere is still
over there?

720
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:27,601
MATT: Your water sphere is still over there.

721
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:33,385
MARISHA: Well, shit. I'm going to drop the watery
sphere.

722
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:36,170
MATT: All right. Splashes into the ground.

723
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:43,479
MARISHA: I'm going to try and Earthbind this
motherfucker.

724
00:50:43,479 --> 00:50:45,084
MATT: All righty.

725
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,272
SAM: The fiend?

726
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:49,405
MARISHA: Yep. Try and get him down.

727
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:58,820
MATT: Earthbind, there. That is a strength saving
throw against your DC.

728
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,925
TALIESIN: Check, or saving throw?

729
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:08,603
MATT: Saving throw. That is a natural 20, so yeah.
No effect, unfortunately. The spell gets shrugged

730
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:13,229
off. It looks like we have an Ashley.

731
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:19,672
LAURA: Ashley, I'm texting you right now to tell
you what you did!

732
00:51:19,672 --> 00:51:24,040
ASHLEY: Okay!

733
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,460
SAM: She's still in set makeup!

734
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,246
LIAM: She's got professional makeup for our game!

735
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:30,031
LAURA: You look so pretty!

736
00:51:30,031 --> 00:51:31,438
MATT: Keyleth.

737
00:51:31,438 --> 00:51:48,286
MARISHA: Fuck, that's it. He blew my action. Can I
try and back away from his crazy presence? I can't

738
00:51:48,286 --> 00:51:50,113
see exactly where I am.

739
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:53,551
MATT: Yeah, you can back away if you want to.
You're right behind here.

740
00:51:53,551 --> 00:51:57,894
MARISHA: Is there a way I can tuck inside the
little tower that's right there?

741
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:01,637
MATT: You see no entrance to the tower, but you
can tuck into this little alcove there, if you want.

742
00:52:01,637 --> 00:52:02,852
MARISHA: Sure.

743
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:05,642
LAURA: Just come back the other way! Come back
toward us!

744
00:52:05,642 --> 00:52:07,145
MARISHA: Can I move toward them?

745
00:52:07,145 --> 00:52:09,870
MATT: This way? If you want to.

746
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,408
MARISHA: And tuck into this alcove, maybe?

747
00:52:12,408 --> 00:52:14,124
MATT: If you move around--

748
00:52:14,124 --> 00:52:15,763
MARISHA: If I move under him?

749
00:52:15,763 --> 00:52:17,627
TALIESIN: He's high enough up. In theory, he can't
reach.

750
00:52:17,627 --> 00:52:19,054
MATT: Well, he's 15 feet above you.

751
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,125
MARISHA: He's only 15 feet?

752
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,283
MATT: Yeah.

753
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:26,091
MARISHA: Okay, hang on. He's only 15 feet.

754
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:30,687
MATT: He's a bigger creature. Moving beneath him,
there's a possibility he may be able to hit you

755
00:52:30,687 --> 00:52:32,607
with something if you move past him.

756
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,383
SAM: Maybe, but maybe not.

757
00:52:34,383 --> 00:52:35,898
LIAM: Underneath, not within five feet?

758
00:52:35,898 --> 00:52:38,673
LAURA: It's different. He's big! He could have a
whip!

759
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:44,204
MARISHA: Okay, can I try something?

760
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:45,681
MATT: Sure.

761
00:52:45,681 --> 00:53:00,624
MARISHA: He's hovering above this? Can I, as a
bonus action, cast Grasping Vine? Right over here?

762
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:02,401
MATT: Over there?

763
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:05,248
MARISHA: No, sorry. Over here.

764
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:11,930
TALIESIN: He can't see it. Against the south wall
of that little building.

765
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,319
MARISHA: And I want to try and Grasping Vine and
drag his ass into the lava.

766
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,924
MATT: Into the lava? Okay, so there's a Grasping
Vine over here.

767
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:22,324
MARISHA: Yeah, that works.

768
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:34,439
MATT: All right. It lashes out toward it, 30 feet.
It has to make a dexterity saving throw. At a 26.

769
00:53:34,439 --> 00:53:35,565
MARISHA: Fuck.

770
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:36,941
TRAVIS: He's rolling good, too!

771
00:53:36,941 --> 00:53:40,495
MATT: Yeah. The vine reaches out toward him and he
(whiplash) out of the way and it whips into the

772
00:53:40,495 --> 00:53:41,869
air and withdraws back.

773
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:48,505
MARISHA: This isn't going well. All right,
whatever. I'm going to move around, still try and

774
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:50,352
dodge him and tuck in this way.

775
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:59,046
MATT: Tuck in there? Okay. As you rush underneath
him, heading down, he has a large mace in his

776
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:05,686
hand. He sweeps down toward you as you go darting.
I'm going to actually roll a percentile dice to

777
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:10,991
see if it manages to catch you, at your height,
because you're a little over five feet tall.

778
00:54:10,991 --> 00:54:12,518
SAM: She's in half cover.

779
00:54:12,518 --> 00:54:14,628
MARISHA: I do have Bigby's Hand.

780
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:21,656
MATT: You do. The interposing hand is helping you
against ranged creatures. The cover doesn't

781
00:54:21,656 --> 00:54:24,042
really-- Well, let me check, just to be sure.

782
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:28,120
LAURA: So many books tonight.

783
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,510
SAM: So many things, guys. Guys, Dungeons and
Dragons.

784
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:43,244
MATT: It does say 'opposite side of the cover'. So yeah, it's
a plus two to your AC.

785
00:54:43,244 --> 00:54:48,168
MARISHA: Of what? Plus two to my AC? Okay!

786
00:54:48,168 --> 00:54:58,542
MATT: As it charges underneath. It would catch you
as you run past. That is a 26 to hit.

787
00:54:58,542 --> 00:55:00,560
MARISHA: Yeah.

788
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,469
MATT: Okay. So as you go rushing underneath him,
scooting behind this wide arc, he swoops downward

789
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:10,782
with the mace, and it clocks you in the side of
the head as a burst of flame comes bursting out

790
00:55:10,782 --> 00:55:16,229
from the side of it. As you continue to run, you
can already feel the blood pouring down the front

791
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,297
of your face from the impact.

792
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:23,578
LIAM: In the immortal words of Laura Bailey,
"Mother bitch!"

793
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:40,020
MATT: 18 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 29
points of fire damage. To the head. (whack)

794
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,940
MARISHA: All right, that hurts.

795
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:47,513
MATT: The mace bursts into flame as soon as it
begins to arc toward her. As it hits her in the

796
00:55:47,513 --> 00:55:51,660
side, you watch her stumble into the side of the
alleyway, the blood pouring from her face. The

797
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,851
flames burn the edges of her hair. The mace is now
alight, angrily.

798
00:55:55,851 --> 00:55:57,840
MARISHA: My antlers <i>and</i> my hair!

799
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,141
MATT: That end your turn, Keyleth?

800
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:02,009
SAM: (singing) Her head is on fire!

801
00:56:02,009 --> 00:56:07,780
MATT: Keyleth, you're done? Vax, you're up.

802
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:12,168
LIAM: Still, even though we established Grog
first? I'll go first.

803
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,394
MATT: Actually, no, we'll let Grog go first since
you guys decided to do that. I'll switch you in

804
00:56:15,394 --> 00:56:17,508
the order here. Grog first.

805
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:27,388
TRAVIS: Could I ask, the roof that is underneath
She-Devil Wonder Woman? How high would it be for

806
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:31,928
Grog to jump using his amazing leaping things?

807
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:33,057
LAURA: His boots?

808
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,458
TRAVIS: Yeah. The boots.

809
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,400
MATT: Well, what does it say on the boots?

810
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:45,152
TRAVIS: It is a bonus action to jump 15 feet.
Boots of Feral Leaping. DC of 15, 15 feet straight

811
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,228
in the air.

812
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:53,569
MATT: The roof is about where she is. She's about
25 feet up. You would be able to get up onto the

813
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:58,276
roof and probably close enough to maybe get a
throwing attack on her.

814
00:56:58,276 --> 00:57:03,526
TRAVIS: Great. Could I try and run over to there,
jump up on the roof, and run right underneath her?

815
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:05,975
MATT: You leap up.

816
00:57:05,975 --> 00:57:11,915
LAURA: I love these things. Right? They're so
fancy.

817
00:57:11,915 --> 00:57:15,482
TRAVIS: Also, can I attach the Chain of Returning
to the Bloodaxe?

818
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:20,186
MATT: You might actually be able to do melee on
this, looking at where she is. She wasn't quite

819
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,042
that high, so you could actually make a melee
attack.

820
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:23,308
TRAVIS: Really?!

821
00:57:23,308 --> 00:57:26,355
MATT: I was looking at her stand for her height,
but that's just her--

822
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:31,049
TRAVIS: Can I make both my attacks reckless, Great
Weapon Master attacks?

823
00:57:31,049 --> 00:57:32,633
MATT: You can, yes.

824
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:44,389
TRAVIS: 17. That is probably going to hit. That is
a 30 on the first one. Nope, 25. Minus five. 25 on

825
00:57:44,389 --> 00:57:45,462
the first one.

826
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,742
MATT: 25 hits.

827
00:57:46,742 --> 00:57:53,061
TRAVIS: Okay. And that's a 27, minus five. 22.

828
00:57:53,061 --> 00:57:54,281
MATT: Both hit.

829
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:55,594
TRAVIS: Nice.

830
00:57:55,594 --> 00:58:00,016
MATT: This is going to be nasty. Actually, hold on.
Was it 22?

831
00:58:00,016 --> 00:58:01,945
TRAVIS: Yeah, 22 was the second one.

832
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,080
MATT: Yeah, that's not going to matter. Okay, so
it still hits. Go for it.

833
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:19,783
TRAVIS: That's the wrong dice. 28 plus ten is 38
for the first one.

834
00:58:19,783 --> 00:58:21,149
MATT: All righty.

835
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:29,844
TRAVIS: And the second one is (counting) 27. 37
for the second one.

836
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:39,794
MATT: 37, whew. That's nasty. All righty, so two
heavy hits as you rush up, using the boots. You

837
00:58:39,794 --> 00:58:44,060
leap onto the rooftop, coming down with your
axe into two giant swings across the armored lady.

838
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:47,633
Each hits her, and you see sparks fly and a bit of
blood begin to seep from some of the wounds.

839
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:50,530
Definitely taking a nice little chunk out of her.

840
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,663
TRAVIS: I want to ask her name, but I don't.

841
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:58,567
MATT: Well, and you don't have time to really ask
because she hisses in your face.

842
00:58:58,567 --> 00:59:00,424
TRAVIS: I'm allergic to cats.

843
00:59:00,424 --> 00:59:05,341
MATT: All right, that end your turn? All right,
Vax now.

844
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,658
LIAM: Is Grog within five feet now? Is he right up
against her?

845
00:59:07,658 --> 00:59:08,762
MATT: Correct.

846
00:59:08,762 --> 00:59:13,509
LIAM: Okay, so what I want to do, hasted, I can go
120 feet. So what I want to do is a tight arc

847
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:19,574
around so that I can go this way and down into
that little corner so I can land behind Keyleth,

848
00:59:19,574 --> 00:59:24,331
but on the way I want to throw a dagger. Yeah, I
want to land right next to Keyleth, down in that

849
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:27,109
little nook. But on the way, I want to throw
Whisper at her.

850
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:31,188
MATT: Okay, go for it. As you arc around here--

851
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:35,633
LIAM: Okay, advantage, so that is very good. 28.

852
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:37,086
MATT: That hits.

853
00:59:37,086 --> 00:59:53,416
LIAM: So that is one plus eight is nine, plus the
sneak attack is (counting) 32, plus the psychic

854
00:59:53,416 --> 01:00:00,583
damage is 33, so that hits her as I go by. I want
to land right behind Keyleth.

855
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:04,076
MATT: Okay. There's not enough space,
technically--

856
01:00:04,076 --> 01:00:08,280
LIAM: There's no room? Can I land right in front
of her? Okay, I land right in front of her, grab

857
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:14,328
her by the face, kiss her full on the mouth, and
cast Heroism through the kiss. Then I'll use my

858
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:26,617
bonus action for movement and fly up to that roof,
straight out across the street from him. From the

859
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:27,773
pit fiend.

860
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:29,371
MATT: So you're going to go across the way from
here?

861
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:32,530
LIAM: You're now immune to fear, and you get two
hit points per round.

862
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,877
MATT: And, Scanlan, you are not. Your Heroism goes
away.

863
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:36,467
LAURA: It's a concentration.

864
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,786
LIAM: Still doing it.

865
01:00:38,786 --> 01:00:41,230
MATT: So which direction are you going?

866
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,728
LIAM: To the tallest building across from the--

867
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:46,041
MATT: Over here?

868
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:48,043
LIAM: No. I don't have the thingie.

869
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:49,362
TRAVIS: Laser pointer, Keyleth.

870
01:00:49,362 --> 01:00:51,599
MATT: That's why I bought you guys laser
pointers.

871
01:00:51,599 --> 01:01:00,028
LIAM: Sorry. This building right here. But in the
little gap right here, this little diagonal spot.

872
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:03,337
MATT: All righty, so, we'll say for this, we'll
put you right there.

873
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:04,897
TRAVIS: How great is that thing?

874
01:01:04,897 --> 01:01:06,263
MATT: Cool.

875
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:09,795
LIAM: So that I'm like this, so just my little
head is peeking out.

876
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:11,976
LAURA: Your little, itty-bitty head.

877
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:13,424
LIAM: Three-quarters cover.

878
01:01:13,424 --> 01:01:17,542
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Percy.

879
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:23,039
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. Okay. Okay, fine.

880
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:30,036
SAM: He passes.

881
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:38,172
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is tell the
servants, get these children out of their chains.

882
01:01:38,172 --> 01:01:42,847
You, either hide or help. Don't care. Turning
around, out of the room.

883
01:01:42,847 --> 01:01:49,635
SAM: My servants start instinctually stroking you.
Touching your hair.

884
01:01:49,635 --> 01:01:53,737
TALIESIN: You're just doing this to touch my hair.
Lord.

885
01:01:53,737 --> 01:01:55,428
SAM: It's all they know.

886
01:01:55,428 --> 01:02:04,443
TALIESIN: So I'm going to come out of the door,
take a look around, see him, and I'm taking a shot at--

887
01:02:04,443 --> 01:02:07,409
MATT: Okay, so you step out of the doorway and
look around-- Because currently, if you just poke

888
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:09,128
out, all you see is the street in front of you.

889
01:02:09,128 --> 01:02:10,537
TALIESIN: No, I'm curling around the door.

890
01:02:10,537 --> 01:02:14,332
MATT: So you have to step out of the door and look
around the side. Okay. So you step out of the

891
01:02:14,332 --> 01:02:17,253
doorway, look off to this side. You have a view of
him.

892
01:02:17,253 --> 01:02:26,013
TALIESIN: Yeah. I see him. I'm going to take a
shot to try and drop him. I'm going to do a wing shot.

893
01:02:26,013 --> 01:02:27,588
MATT: Okay.

894
01:02:27,588 --> 01:02:30,366
TALIESIN: Burning grit.

895
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:33,496
SAM: Burning down the grit.

896
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:37,780
TALIESIN: Normal shot. Natural 20.

897
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,293
MARISHA: Hey!

898
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:42,153
TRAVIS: Golden snitch!

899
01:02:42,153 --> 01:02:44,856
MARISHA: That was the wing shot?

900
01:02:44,856 --> 01:02:47,332
TALIESIN: That was the wing shot. It doesn't
matter, it doesn't affect the wing shot.

901
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:50,194
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't do damage, it just brings
him down.

902
01:02:50,194 --> 01:02:51,752
TALIESIN: Well, no, the shot still does damage.

903
01:02:51,752 --> 01:02:54,033
MATT: Oh, sorry, but yeah, so 20 does--

904
01:02:54,033 --> 01:02:56,663
TALIESIN: But he still has to do a strength saving
check.

905
01:02:56,663 --> 01:03:01,602
LAURA: Even on a crit? But it's at disadvantage
because of Hex.

906
01:03:01,602 --> 01:03:04,362
TALIESIN: No, that's a strength check.

907
01:03:04,362 --> 01:03:07,741
MATT: Ability checks versus saving throws. So he
rolls a 20. What's the DC?

908
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:11,984
TALIESIN: I can't find the DC. Where did the DC
go?

909
01:03:11,984 --> 01:03:13,310
SAM: Just say, like, 50.

910
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:21,042
TALIESIN: 50. No, it's not 50. I think the
difficulty, I can't find it, but I think it's 18.

911
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:26,788
MATT: Okay, if you haven't updated it, that's your
own fault. All right, so it succeeds the save. It

912
01:03:26,788 --> 01:03:29,593
does not get reduced. But it does take double
damage, so go ahead and roll for that.

913
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:53,119
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm so confused. Here
they are. So, double damage. So that's 18, 22

914
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,057
points of normal damage.

915
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:57,596
MATT: Okay.

916
01:03:57,596 --> 01:04:00,247
SAM: Piercing?

917
01:04:00,247 --> 01:04:12,839
TALIESIN: Of piercing damage. Three points of
necrotic damage. Two points of psychic damage. I'm

918
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:16,802
going to try another shot to bring him down, same
thing. Oh, actually, that's a natural, so I don't

919
01:04:16,802 --> 01:04:19,253
even burn any grit. I'm going to try and bring him
down again.

920
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:20,942
MATT: Okay.

921
01:04:20,942 --> 01:04:23,598
TALIESIN: That's 25.

922
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:28,771
MATT: 25 hits. That is a 26 on the strength save.

923
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:35,247
TALIESIN: And that's not the right dice to roll,
hold on. Wow, I'm really out of it. Here we go.

924
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:44,932
That's 14 piercing. Four psychic. Six necrotic.

925
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:47,262
MATT: All right, cool.

926
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:49,667
TALIESIN: 14, four, and six, altogether.

927
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,655
MATT: 24 total. All righty.

928
01:04:51,655 --> 01:05:06,308
TALIESIN: Then, one more attempt to bring him down
to earth. Here we go. That's 21 to hit.

929
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:14,517
MATT: 21 hits. (laughing) Rolled the same, 26.

930
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:16,696
TALIESIN: Can you switch dice? That would be
cool.

931
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:20,357
MATT: No, he's-- 18 plus eight, yeah.

932
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:22,120
LIAM: Matt bought a platinum snitch.

933
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,765
MATT: I bought a dice to combat you, Percy!

934
01:05:25,765 --> 01:05:30,678
TALIESIN: Oh, that's awful. Nine points of normal
damage, three points of necrotic, three points of

935
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:31,695
psychic.

936
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:33,532
MATT: Okay. 15, got it. All right, cool!

937
01:05:33,532 --> 01:05:38,949
TALIESIN: And bonus round, I reload and I'm going
to finish running to the other side of the--

938
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:42,360
MATT: Going this way? This way?

939
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:47,623
TALIESIN: Yeah. And just hiding against the wall
there. Not even-- just by the fruit. By the fruit

940
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:50,705
cart. Next to the barrel of ugh.

941
01:05:50,705 --> 01:05:53,859
SAM: The explosive barrel that certainly won't
explode.

942
01:05:53,859 --> 01:05:57,163
TRAVIS: Yeah, clearly. The red barrel that says
TNT.

943
01:05:57,163 --> 01:06:03,602
MATT: There you go. Okay, that ends Percy's turn.
Next up is Ghurrix. Ghurrix, who currently the

944
01:06:03,602 --> 01:06:06,142
issue with the hand being a problem, it's
frustrating--

945
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:08,690
(laughter)

946
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:15,971
MATT: --watches this equally frustrating flying
dagger machine flying about. After approaching

947
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:21,517
her, touching her, casting something on her, then
darting off to the side. (mumbling) Versus, he

948
01:06:21,517 --> 01:06:30,904
can't see right there, he's going that way, he's
going to leap into the air. And you watch as this

949
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:36,155
giant devil comes swooping in towards you, lands
on the edge of the rooftop, you hear the top crack

950
01:06:36,155 --> 01:06:41,409
and some of the nearby obsidian that marks the
side of the stone roof shatter and break as dust

951
01:06:41,409 --> 01:06:44,103
and pebbles begin to break off and tumble down the
sides of the roof.

952
01:06:44,103 --> 01:06:45,828
LIAM: Dustin fell off the roof?

953
01:06:45,828 --> 01:06:49,485
MATT: It's going to go ahead and make four attacks
on you.

954
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:50,762
LIAM: Slightly nervous.

955
01:06:50,762 --> 01:06:52,755
MATT: Bite, claw, mace, and tail.

956
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:56,677
SAM: Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.

957
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:59,710
LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge on the first one, I
guess.

958
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:04,825
MATT: Okay, the first one is the claw, that is a
32.

959
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:07,005
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

960
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:17,450
MATT: All righty. So that is 13 points of slashing
damage with the claw.

961
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,023
LIAM: That's what's halved?

962
01:07:19,023 --> 01:07:26,448
MATT: So half of that would be six. The bite
attack against you. That is--

963
01:07:26,448 --> 01:07:28,818
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words on that one.

964
01:07:28,818 --> 01:07:29,972
MATT: Okay.

965
01:07:29,972 --> 01:07:31,649
SAM: I'm going to try to distract.

966
01:07:31,649 --> 01:07:38,244
MATT: So 26 to hit. What's the range on that? 60
feet, right? Yeah, so that's fine. 26 to hit?

967
01:07:38,244 --> 01:07:39,513
LIAM: 26 hits.

968
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:44,841
SAM: I'm going to yell up at the thing, we never
decided where you would send the check for those

969
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:57,422
boys! My address is 1 Greyskull Keep, Emon, 90210,
courtesy of François Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia!

970
01:07:57,422 --> 01:08:04,960
But you should really forward it to Percival von
Fredrickstein von Musel de Rolo!

971
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,947
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d12.

972
01:08:08,947 --> 01:08:12,788
LIAM: Good, you just need it to go down four
points.

973
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,233
SAM: 12 points.

974
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:16,153
MATT: That'll do it!

975
01:08:16,153 --> 01:08:18,027
TRAVIS: Where was that shit during the card game?

976
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,339
(laughter)

977
01:08:21,339 --> 01:08:26,898
MATT: So frustrating. Okay. So, as he goes in to
bite, you duck out of the way and it's going to

978
01:08:26,898 --> 01:08:32,588
grasp for your throat, however the shouting
Scanlan causes his eyes to dart to the side and it

979
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:33,772
just misses by an inch.

980
01:08:33,772 --> 01:08:35,309
LIAM: Love that little man!

981
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:40,075
MATT: It's going to go for its tail attack now.
That is a natural 20.

982
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:43,587
LIAM: I'd like to use my first Luck on him, so he
has to roll again.

983
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:47,068
MATT: All right. Natural 20!

984
01:08:47,068 --> 01:08:48,394
(groans)

985
01:08:48,394 --> 01:08:50,372
MATT: I'm not even joking, you can come look if
you want!

986
01:08:50,372 --> 01:08:52,205
LIAM: Go fuck yourself!

987
01:08:52,205 --> 01:08:57,578
MATT: I'm not even joking! I'm going to take a
picture, 'cause that's fun. That's fun.

988
01:08:57,578 --> 01:09:01,232
LIAM: It's fine, I'll die and roll another
character, it's fine!

989
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:02,971
TRAVIS: Wow, two in row! Was that the studded
guy?

990
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:05,237
MATT: Oh yeah! That's the one I use for my big
actions.

991
01:09:05,237 --> 01:09:10,639
LAURA: Oh no! His figure just died!

992
01:09:10,639 --> 01:09:11,283
MATT: Oh no!

993
01:09:11,283 --> 01:09:12,923
SAM: Vax just died.

994
01:09:12,923 --> 01:09:16,869
MATT: This is where it starts. Hey. That was the
tail, right?

995
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,072
LIAM: Yeah.

996
01:09:18,072 --> 01:09:19,903
MATT: So that's 3d10...

997
01:09:19,903 --> 01:09:21,563
LIAM: Wow, two 20s.

998
01:09:21,563 --> 01:09:24,678
MATT: That was amazing. I kind of wish I was using
that on the mace, but that's fine.

999
01:09:24,678 --> 01:09:27,632
LIAM: Avenge me!

1000
01:09:27,632 --> 01:09:32,835
LAURA: If you fall unconscious, try to fall
unconscious the <i>other</i> direction, okay?

1001
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:37,927
LIAM: Fall down on the mocap mattress!

1002
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:40,248
MATT: That's 46 points of bludgeoning damage.

1003
01:09:40,248 --> 01:09:46,817
LIAM: 4d6 or 46? 46, great.

1004
01:09:46,817 --> 01:09:49,117
MATT: Sorry, 44. Take that back, sorry, 44.

1005
01:09:49,117 --> 01:09:50,630
LIAM: Well, that's much different.

1006
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,482
MATT: There you go. 44 points of bludgeoning
damage.

1007
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:58,276
MATT: As the tail (whack) slams into you as it
spins around, and as the tail hits you it already

1008
01:09:58,276 --> 01:10:03,562
has its mace, the flames curling off of it,
swinging in a backhand motion, toward you. That's

1009
01:10:03,562 --> 01:10:07,434
going to be a 22.

1010
01:10:07,434 --> 01:10:08,704
LIAM: Doesn't hit!

1011
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,002
MATT: Doesn't hit?

1012
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:14,240
LIAM: Doesn't hit, because I just got knocked
down, so it went over my fucking prone body!

1013
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:23,446
MATT: Okay, so that ends its turn at the moment.

1014
01:10:23,446 --> 01:10:26,865
LIAM: Everyone hears (groaning).

1015
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:29,589
MATT: And you know what? Actually--

1016
01:10:29,589 --> 01:10:34,280
LIAM: Does he leave a Cleveland Steamer on me as
well?

1017
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,225
LAURA: He's still got movement left.

1018
01:10:37,225 --> 01:10:50,708
MATT: It's going to go ahead and fly down a bit.
Behind there.

1019
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,935
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh, what a dick!

1020
01:10:53,935 --> 01:10:56,775
MARISHA: What's he doing? Is he hovering over the
lava?

1021
01:10:56,775 --> 01:10:58,633
MATT: You do get an attack of opportunity if you'd
like.

1022
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:01,842
LIAM: Oh, sneak attack? No sneak attack. Okay,
fine. (wheezing) Ouch!

1023
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:03,843
MATT: Yeah, just reaching over toward it.

1024
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:08,110
LIAM: Ah, no, probably not. No. 16.

1025
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:26,864
MATT: 16? No. Now, the erinyes, which is up
against you, Grog, let's see. Yep! It's going to

1026
01:11:26,864 --> 01:11:31,461
go ahead and first reach off to the side and take
its rope that it has. Throws it out in your

1027
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:36,105
direction. The rope suddenly sparks to life like a
magical snake and begins wrapping around your body

1028
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:37,156
rapidly.

1029
01:11:37,156 --> 01:11:38,750
TRAVIS: Not nice.

1030
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:44,643
MATT: All right, go ahead and make either a
strength or dexterity check.

1031
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:55,833
TRAVIS: I have advantage on both. No, strength.
Natural 20.

1032
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,104
MATT: No effect.

1033
01:11:58,104 --> 01:12:03,043
TRAVIS: I did not do that in a gloating way,
because I feel like that was very lucky.

1034
01:12:03,043 --> 01:12:09,783
MATT: The rope that tries to wrap around you
bursts off and whips back to the side. The erinyes

1035
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:17,258
is now going to attempt to fly back and away from
you, which is going to offer you an attack of

1036
01:12:17,258 --> 01:12:18,451
opportunity, Grog.

1037
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:33,297
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. Reckless and Great Weapon Master,
please. That's two natural ones in a row. My yin

1038
01:12:33,297 --> 01:12:35,711
to your yang, sir. Jesus.

1039
01:12:35,711 --> 01:12:41,739
LAURA: You want to put that in my jail?

1040
01:12:41,739 --> 01:12:44,598
TRAVIS: No, I don't subscribe to that voodoo
bullshit.

1041
01:12:44,598 --> 01:12:53,383
MATT: It's going to pull its bow out, its longbow,
while it's up in the air, pull back and loose an

1042
01:12:53,383 --> 01:12:59,682
arrow against you, Grog. That is 21.

1043
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:00,880
TRAVIS: Hits.

1044
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:21,845
MATT: Yes. All righty. So you take seven points of
piercing damage, halved. Plus 14 points of poison

1045
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:26,856
damage, which is not halved. I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

1046
01:13:26,856 --> 01:13:31,936
TRAVIS: Wait, I have resistance to poison because
of the Belt of Dwarvenkind.

1047
01:13:31,936 --> 01:13:36,946
MATT: You do, so you take half that, actually, so
you take seven points of poison damage. You still

1048
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:40,191
need to make a constitution saving throw.

1049
01:13:40,191 --> 01:13:44,775
TRAVIS: Okay. 21.

1050
01:13:44,775 --> 01:13:48,737
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You resist the poison
effect as it pulses through your system. All

1051
01:13:48,737 --> 01:13:59,828
right. It still has a little more movement, so
it's going to go ahead and dart over.

1052
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:03,169
TRAVIS: She's got poisonous arrows!

1053
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:04,820
LAURA: Poisonless?

1054
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,358
TRAVIS: Yeah, how do you say it?

1055
01:14:07,358 --> 01:14:11,392
LAURA: God, is she flying really far away?

1056
01:14:11,392 --> 01:14:16,996
TRAVIS: She's fleeing! I don't blame you!

1057
01:14:16,996 --> 01:14:24,851
MATT: We'll say she darts down and vanishes behind
this, there. All righty. That brings us to

1058
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:29,035
Scanlan.

1059
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:33,571
SAM: I can't see any of our fucking opponents.

1060
01:14:33,571 --> 01:14:34,928
MATT: Nope!

1061
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:38,274
SAM: This sucks!

1062
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:40,644
LAURA: Can Bigby pick you up?

1063
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:42,070
TRAVIS: Wait, where did she go?

1064
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:43,390
MARISHA: Yeah, where is she?

1065
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,298
MATT: She jumped up on the top of the tower.

1066
01:14:45,298 --> 01:14:46,895
MARISHA: Oh. Bitch.

1067
01:14:46,895 --> 01:14:53,245
SAM: We won, guys! They left!

1068
01:14:53,245 --> 01:14:55,537
TRAVIS: We could flee.

1069
01:14:55,537 --> 01:15:10,971
SAM: No thanks. Shit. As my bonus action, I will
have Bigby lift me up as high as I can go. See if

1070
01:15:10,971 --> 01:15:12,826
I can see any of these fuckers.

1071
01:15:12,826 --> 01:15:15,414
MATT: Okay, so you're changing it from the
interposing hand to a lift?

1072
01:15:15,414 --> 01:15:16,490
SAM: Yes.

1073
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:22,864
MATT: Okay. So we'll say Bigby is pretty easy to
lift you up. How far can you move Bigby in a turn?

1074
01:15:22,864 --> 01:15:26,391
SAM: 60 foot movement. It takes a couple feet to
get to me, too, right?

1075
01:15:26,391 --> 01:15:33,419
MATT: Yeah, so it would take ten, I'll say 15 feet
to scoop you up, so there's another 45 feet that

1076
01:15:33,419 --> 01:15:34,983
you can rise up if you want to.

1077
01:15:34,983 --> 01:15:37,244
TRAVIS: Remember, we can hold until we see them,
right?

1078
01:15:37,244 --> 01:15:41,388
LAURA: Yes, we can. But you can't move after, you 
can only do your action.

1079
01:15:41,388 --> 01:15:50,663
MATT: Bigby's Hand can lift you up to about there.
So you can see, with half cover, the erinyes down

1080
01:15:50,663 --> 01:15:54,555
there, and three-quarters cover from the--

1081
01:15:54,555 --> 01:16:00,088
SAM: Oh, I can see them now? Oh, that's great! How
far away are they from me?

1082
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:07,824
MATT: It's hard to say. I'd say probably anywhere
between 50, 60 feet? The erinyes is a little

1083
01:16:07,824 --> 01:16:10,282
closer. She's maybe 35, 40 feet from you.

1084
01:16:10,282 --> 01:16:22,581
SAM: (softly) Fuck. All right, I will-- shit. I
don't care about the fucking erinyes thing. If I

1085
01:16:22,581 --> 01:16:26,812
take a lightning shot at the pit fiend, will I hit
Vax?

1086
01:16:26,812 --> 01:16:28,913
MATT: You can probably aim it so it wouldn't.

1087
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:32,191
SAM: Can I get it so close to him that he's
frightened for a second?

1088
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:33,889
MATT: Sure, you can do that!

1089
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:47,559
SAM: It's such a weak attack, though. Shit. Shit!
All right, sure, I'll take it. I'll do a Lightning

1090
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:55,123
Bolt-- No! I'm not, I'm going to hold my attack
until one of them gets closer. I'm going to hold a

1091
01:16:55,123 --> 01:16:57,246
spell. Do I have to declare it now?

1092
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,066
MATT: You have to declare the spell.

1093
01:16:59,066 --> 01:17:00,342
SAM: Shit.

1094
01:17:00,342 --> 01:17:02,164
MATT: And whatever the trigger is.

1095
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:13,354
SAM: Shit. I will hold Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
until the pit fiend comes within range.

1096
01:17:13,354 --> 01:17:14,676
MATT: And who are you casting it on?

1097
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:15,846
SAM: The pit fiend.

1098
01:17:15,846 --> 01:17:19,286
MATT: Okay, good to know. All right, Pike, you're
up.

1099
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:23,072
ASHLEY: Okay! Hello, everybody!

1100
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:25,973
LIAM: Oh, hi, Pike!

1101
01:17:25,973 --> 01:17:29,555
ASHLEY: Okay, so where am I?

1102
01:17:29,555 --> 01:17:34,668
MATT: You are inside the mansion, the doorway of
which is right there. It's this tiny little spot

1103
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:39,880
there. You don't see any of your friends, except
for Trinket, who's across the way. You

1104
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:44,348
occasionally hear bouts of battle outside. To
really see what's going on, you'd have to step out

1105
01:17:44,348 --> 01:17:45,945
of the mansion.

1106
01:17:45,945 --> 01:17:57,343
ASHLEY: Okay, so the door is open? Okay. Can I pop
out? How close am I to either of the bad guys?

1107
01:17:57,343 --> 01:18:04,540
MATT: Not at all. As you step out, you don't see
either of them. They are currently not visible

1108
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,733
from your perspective.

1109
01:18:05,733 --> 01:18:09,170
TRAVIS: One of them is way up on a tower, and one
is on the other side of a row of buildings from you.

1110
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,822
MATT: But she doesn't know that.

1111
01:18:10,822 --> 01:18:16,515
ASHLEY: Okay, am I close to Vax at all, if I peek
out?

1112
01:18:16,515 --> 01:18:19,770
LIAM: You don't even know how fucked up I am,
probably.

1113
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,521
MARISHA: You're kind of close to me.

1114
01:18:21,521 --> 01:18:24,653
MATT: The downside of hiding in a mansion. Good
news is, you're defended. Bad news is, you don't

1115
01:18:24,653 --> 01:18:25,823
know what's going on.

1116
01:18:25,823 --> 01:18:28,159
MARISHA: You can see me and Grog, and that's
pretty much it.

1117
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:31,792
MATT: And Scanlan, way up in the air above you,
being held by Bigby's Hand.

1118
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:40,108
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to pop out and I'm going
to heal Keyleth, because you're hurting?

1119
01:18:40,108 --> 01:18:41,940
MARISHA: Yeah, I am. Thank you!

1120
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:45,897
ASHLEY: Okay, here I come!

1121
01:18:45,897 --> 01:18:51,600
LAURA: Oh wait, don't forget, Ashley, you have the
Spiritual Weapon up as a bonus action!

1122
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,059
MATT: Yeah, you can move it 20 feet.

1123
01:18:53,059 --> 01:19:03,716
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay. Am I close to her? Sorry, I
can't see the map. You all look like little

1124
01:19:03,716 --> 01:19:05,143
pixelated blocks.

1125
01:19:05,143 --> 01:19:07,720
MATT: Understood. You're about 30 feet from
Keyleth.

1126
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:13,754
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm going to cast Healing Word,
then, since I can't touch her.

1127
01:19:13,754 --> 01:19:15,283
MATT: Okay.

1128
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:32,750
ASHLEY: (mumbling) Sorry guys, this is taking a
minute. Okay, well, you heal nine points.

1129
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,902
MATT: There you go, Keyleth.

1130
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:38,682
SAM: Keyleth, your hair's still on fire.

1131
01:19:38,682 --> 01:19:40,807
MARISHA: Oh, shit, dammit.

1132
01:19:40,807 --> 01:19:46,159
ASHLEY: So, the bonus, is the Spiritual Weapon
still out there?

1133
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:52,038
MATT: It is. It's floating up in the air, about 15
feet up, in this alleyway here. You don't really

1134
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:56,151
know where any targets are at the moment, but you
can still move it 20 feet if you want to.

1135
01:19:56,151 --> 01:20:00,538
ASHLEY: Can I move it 20 feet closer to them?

1136
01:20:00,538 --> 01:20:02,244
MATT: You don't know where either of them are.

1137
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:07,689
ASHLEY: All right, I'll leave it if I can't see.
That'll be my turn.

1138
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:12,243
MATT: All right, that's the end of Pike's turn.
Top of the round, Vex, you're up. You're still

1139
01:20:12,243 --> 01:20:13,748
inside the mansion.

1140
01:20:13,748 --> 01:20:17,981
LAURA: I come out of the mansion. I want to fly
out of the mansion on my broom.

1141
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:21,309
MATT: All right, you fly out of the mansion on
your broom.

1142
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:22,965
SAM: Where you going, Vex?

1143
01:20:22,965 --> 01:20:29,730
LAURA: I don't know! I fly up in the air and
see-- My goal was just to come out, spin around,

1144
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,790
and attack, but I don't see anything. So I want to
be about there.

1145
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:39,278
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this that
you're pretty close to Scanlan. So as you swoop up

1146
01:20:39,278 --> 01:20:45,325
to the side, you can see just barely aspects of
the two of them, hiding behind edges of rooftops

1147
01:20:45,325 --> 01:20:46,488
and towers.

1148
01:20:46,488 --> 01:20:49,397
LAURA: Okay, I don't want to actually be that
close to Scanlan, though, for the actual--

1149
01:20:49,397 --> 01:20:51,266
MATT: So, over here.

1150
01:20:51,266 --> 01:20:52,196
LAURA: Yeah.

1151
01:20:52,196 --> 01:20:55,044
SAM: As she floats away, I try to grab her butt.

1152
01:20:55,044 --> 01:21:00,536
LAURA: I want to shoot a couple of arrows at the
pit fiend. Is he under cover?

1153
01:21:00,536 --> 01:21:03,527
MATT: Yes, he has three-quarters cover, so he has
plus five to his armor class.

1154
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:05,747
LAURA: Can I be any closer so I wouldn't have
that?

1155
01:21:05,747 --> 01:21:08,161
MATT: To get high enough to even see him, that's
going to be your full movement.

1156
01:21:08,161 --> 01:21:09,652
LAURA: Okay.

1157
01:21:09,652 --> 01:21:13,393
LIAM: Why not do your full movement? It doesn't
take away from your actions.

1158
01:21:13,393 --> 01:21:15,524
LAURA: No, that's what he said. It's my full
movement just to see him.

1159
01:21:15,524 --> 01:21:16,909
LIAM: Oh, for another full movement.

1160
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:18,205
LAURA: Yeah.

1161
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:24,588
MATT: So you rolled a nat one? First arrow arcs
off in the distance.

1162
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:28,072
TRAVIS: This is the least amount of d20s that
she's ever had in that tray.

1163
01:21:28,072 --> 01:21:34,829
LAURA: I have four ones that are, right now, in
jail. Second attack is a 29.

1164
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:37,435
MATT: 29 hits, yeah. Even with the three-quarters
cover.

1165
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:48,397
LAURA: Great, cool, tight, awesome! 20.

1166
01:21:48,397 --> 01:21:51,334
MATT: All right, 20 points of damage. Nice.

1167
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:53,611
SAM: Looking pretty rough?

1168
01:21:53,611 --> 01:21:56,638
MATT: You can barely see him.

1169
01:21:56,638 --> 01:22:02,852
LAURA: And then, for Trinket's action, can he run
up after Grog on the roof? Can he try to scramble up?

1170
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:07,972
MATT: Trinket's full movement, he can get there
and start trying to climb. Go ahead and roll an

1171
01:22:07,972 --> 01:22:10,624
athletics check for Trinket.

1172
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:18,311
LAURA: He rolled really low. What is that, just
strength?

1173
01:22:18,311 --> 01:22:19,963
MATT: Yeah, for him.

1174
01:22:19,963 --> 01:22:21,435
LAURA: So he rolled five.

1175
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:26,507
MATT: Trinket is leaving these giant claw marks on
the outside of the building. Not quite getting

1176
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:29,761
there. Starting to break the side of the stand
that's next to him.

1177
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:32,198
LAURA: Wow, I've got to get some more 20s out
here.

1178
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:35,977
MATT: Actually, at this point, too, a number of
the individuals on the street that are watching,

1179
01:22:35,977 --> 01:22:40,884
as you're starting to move around, people are
starting to back away and leave the space. These

1180
01:22:40,884 --> 01:22:45,848
two guys disappear and start heading out of the
street to get away from everything. These guys all

1181
01:22:45,848 --> 01:22:54,685
begin to move this direction to get away from it
all, pulling their various chained servants with them.

1182
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:57,061
TRAVIS: Anyone staying and watching? Eating
popcorn?

1183
01:22:57,061 --> 01:23:02,574
MATT: No, for the most part, once they realized
the scope of what's going on, they were like, "We

1184
01:23:02,574 --> 01:23:06,353
"should get out of the way." Ending Vex's turn,
Keyleth, you're up.

1185
01:23:06,353 --> 01:23:14,420
MARISHA: Okay, do I have any view on Big Pharma?

1186
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:17,345
MATT: No, you have no visual on either of them.

1187
01:23:17,345 --> 01:23:22,426
MARISHA: Okay. Is he peeking off, like if I
shifted around, would I be able to see a little?

1188
01:23:22,426 --> 01:23:26,154
MATT: You could try. You saw him disappear behind
the roof, but you don't see him.

1189
01:23:26,154 --> 01:23:33,199
MARISHA: I'm going to try and shift toward you, to
see if I can see him around the lava bend.

1190
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:40,186
MATT: Around this way? Okay, you get your full
movement there. Currently no view of him.

1191
01:23:40,186 --> 01:23:56,094
MARISHA: Okay. Can I take my action to go ahead
and cast Sunbeam and then hold it until I see him?

1192
01:23:56,094 --> 01:24:01,290
MATT: What you would do is, you would begin
casting the spell and hold your action of casting

1193
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:02,355
Sunbeam.

1194
01:24:02,355 --> 01:24:03,539
MARISHA: That's what I want to do.

1195
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:04,847
MATT: Okay, and what's the trigger for it?

1196
01:24:04,847 --> 01:24:06,031
MARISHA: Whenever I see him.

1197
01:24:06,031 --> 01:24:11,049
MATT: Visual? Okay, good to know. That's the end
of Keyleth's turn. Grog, you're up.

1198
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:17,088
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I move to the tippy-top of the
roof and, frustrated with my inability to follow

1199
01:24:17,088 --> 01:24:24,123
this winged piece of shit, can I take the
Titanstone Knuckles and slam them together, and

1200
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:25,726
enlarge myself?

1201
01:24:25,726 --> 01:24:31,113
MATT: Yes you can! With what sounds like a mild sound
of cracking thunder, these two sides of his

1202
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:37,294
gauntlets slam, causing Grog's size to swell to
astronomical proportions.

1203
01:24:37,294 --> 01:24:40,022
LIAM: That's just a wee jump to that tower now!

1204
01:24:40,022 --> 01:24:47,318
TRAVIS: That's what I was hoping for, but we'll
see. But I have to ask. So that ornamental thing

1205
01:24:47,318 --> 01:24:52,643
that's above the doorway of the tower, does it
look like something I might be able to make a

1206
01:24:52,643 --> 01:24:58,246
leap, with my Boots of Feral Leaping, and start a
very rudimentary climbing up the side of the

1207
01:24:58,246 --> 01:25:02,671
tower, King Kong-style, if I wanted to try and get
up to where she is? Or would I be better suited

1208
01:25:02,671 --> 01:25:04,019
jumping down?

1209
01:25:04,019 --> 01:25:05,702
MATT: What are the limitations on the boots?

1210
01:25:05,702 --> 01:25:09,879
TRAVIS: It says 15 feet straight up, or 20 feet
horizontally.

1211
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:12,240
MATT: Right, and there's no limitation to the
number of times it can be used?

1212
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:18,544
TRAVIS: Bonus action, that's it. If I fail the DC,
I fall prone.

1213
01:25:18,544 --> 01:25:23,665
MATT: Gotcha. Cool. So you could attempt to do
it.

1214
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:33,312
TRAVIS: Cool. Well, go big or go home. I'm going
to try and jump towards the tower and grab onto

1215
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:36,320
that ornamental fixture that's just above the
doorway.

1216
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:41,663
MATT: Okay, so as you jump and leap, I need you to
make an athletics check.

1217
01:25:41,663 --> 01:25:42,964
TRAVIS: Okay.

1218
01:25:42,964 --> 01:25:45,106
LAURA: I feel like you could make it to the top
edge.

1219
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:48,144
SAM: Let him do his parkour, people.

1220
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:52,910
TRAVIS: Well yeah, in essence, I would like to
jump towards the tower. If it goes better than I

1221
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:56,880
thought, then awesome. 21.

1222
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:03,117
MATT: So you leap across the way and catch onto
the side of the building there. Your fingers sink

1223
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:08,454
into the stone, your Titanstone Gauntlets. So
that's your bonus action. You're now holding on to

1224
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:09,643
the side of the building.

1225
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:12,707
TRAVIS: Could I use my movement to Crossfit my way
up?

1226
01:26:12,707 --> 01:26:21,411
MATT: As you climb over the side, you do manage to
get right over (impacts) right there. You see the

1227
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:25,803
erinyes is ducked down with the longbow drawn,
with an arrow. Looks up and sees your much larger,

1228
01:26:25,803 --> 01:26:30,906
now, face, grinning over the side, as you grin
back and then (impact) land on the opposite.

1229
01:26:30,906 --> 01:26:40,160
TRAVIS: (panting) Hold on, I need a breather. Naw,
I'm just fucking about. You're dead. Can I go into

1230
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:45,671
a frenzied-- no, that was my bonus action, so I
get two. Can I do reckless, Great Weapon

1231
01:26:45,671 --> 01:26:48,035
Master, two attacks on She-Ra?

1232
01:26:48,035 --> 01:26:49,938
MATT: Yes, you may.

1233
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:58,312
TRAVIS: 21.

1234
01:26:58,312 --> 01:27:06,905
MATT: 21? Does hit. However, she's going to use
her reaction to parry. So, as you begin to do

1235
01:27:06,905 --> 01:27:12,865
that, she releases the tension on the arrow, pulls
her longsword out, and parries the blade to the

1236
01:27:12,865 --> 01:27:17,841
side. It adds four to her AC, and you miss by one.
The axe slides off and slams into the stonework

1237
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:20,114
next to her as she begins to step away from you.

1238
01:27:20,114 --> 01:27:22,760
TRAVIS: Whoa. Do I know if she can do that again?

1239
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,844
MATT: You don't know.

1240
01:27:23,844 --> 01:27:28,733
TRAVIS: Right, kitten's got claws. I'll make the
second one reckless, but not Great Weapon Master.

1241
01:27:28,733 --> 01:27:33,341
I already said it was, should I do it again
because I said it? All right, fine.

1242
01:27:33,341 --> 01:27:36,467
LAURA: She probably can't do it again.

1243
01:27:36,467 --> 01:27:43,013
TRAVIS: 31. Minus five, 26.

1244
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:44,601
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1245
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:59,520
TRAVIS: Hey, she didn't do it again! Yahtzee. One
point of necrotic, 26, plus ten is 36.

1246
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:06,386
MATT: 36, oof. All righty. That end your turn?

1247
01:28:06,386 --> 01:28:10,604
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm a little attracted to the fact
that she parried my first one. I'm kind of

1248
01:28:10,604 --> 01:28:16,404
confused. Plus, you know, we're up high in the
air, and the city's on fire. It's very romantic.

1249
01:28:16,404 --> 01:28:19,939
MATT: Perfect.

1250
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:21,248
TRAVIS: That's it, that's my turn.

1251
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,377
MATT: All righty, that ends your turn. That brings
us to Vax.

1252
01:28:22,377 --> 01:28:24,421
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use a bonus
action--

1253
01:28:24,421 --> 01:28:29,347
MATT: At the beginning of your turn, as you're on
the edge of the roof, you see the being's right

1254
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:33,399
there, looming, just out of your arm's reach. I
need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

1255
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:40,240
LIAM: Yes. But I'm a half-elf, so I get advantage.
Let's see how I do. Pretty good! 18.

1256
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:45,628
MATT: 18? The sheer presence of this entity shakes
you to the core. You are considered frightened

1257
01:28:45,628 --> 01:28:46,567
right now.

1258
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:50,747
LIAM: Okay, so I can't go toward him, right?

1259
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:55,881
MATT: You cannot go toward him. While he's in the
line of sight to you, your attacks and ability

1260
01:28:55,881 --> 01:28:57,250
checks have disadvantage.

1261
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,727
LIAM: On him, or everything?

1262
01:28:58,727 --> 01:29:02,616
MATT: As long as he's within your line of sight,
you have disadvantage on all of your attacks and

1263
01:29:02,616 --> 01:29:03,567
ability checks.

1264
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:07,649
LIAM: That's fine, I won't do fuck-all with him.
So. For my bonus action, I'm plugging my single

1265
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:20,641
potion of greater healing into my mouth, to start.
So that's 4d4 plus four, right? (adding) 16. Okay,

1266
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:26,258
I'll figure that out in a second. Then I want to
use my first action to-- He's right up on me? I'll

1267
01:29:26,258 --> 01:29:33,017
use my first action to disengage, and then I'm
going to arc, almost go in a straight line, but

1268
01:29:33,017 --> 01:29:37,355
arc slightly around the tower. Since Grog is right
on the erinyes, I want to throw Whisper again at

1269
01:29:37,355 --> 01:29:45,249
her as I zing by, 20 feet away from her. Yeah?
Throw Whisper at her as I go by, and land as far

1270
01:29:45,249 --> 01:29:48,872
away from the pit demon, because I'm so scared, as
I can.

1271
01:29:48,872 --> 01:29:50,101
MATT: Over here?

1272
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:53,439
LIAM: As far away as I can get, and I can go 120
feet with movement. Hasted.

1273
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:58,630
MATT: In order to still be in view of the erinyes,
he's still in view of you. So you'd have

1274
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:00,949
disadvantage on the attack against the erinyes.
But you can go ahead and do it.

1275
01:30:00,949 --> 01:30:05,717
LIAM: Against her? But that cancels out, because I
have advantage because Grog's right on her.

1276
01:30:05,717 --> 01:30:09,094
MATT: You don't get advantage on the attacks for
hitting someone. You just can sneak attack them.

1277
01:30:09,094 --> 01:30:11,875
LIAM: You're right, yes. Thank you.

1278
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:13,182
MATT: So disadvantage.

1279
01:30:13,182 --> 01:30:17,025
LIAM: Disadvantage on the attack. Oh, balls. One.

1280
01:30:17,025 --> 01:30:22,421
MATT: Streaks off and returns to your side. You're
landing over here, you said?

1281
01:30:22,421 --> 01:30:30,190
LIAM: As far as I can get, 120 feet. If there's a
nook to scoot behind in the corner, I will.

1282
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:31,604
MATT: You could probably scoot behind that way.

1283
01:30:31,604 --> 01:30:32,789
LIAM: All right.

1284
01:30:32,789 --> 01:30:39,031
MATT: All righty. Great.

1285
01:30:39,031 --> 01:30:43,703
LAURA: Is that her name? It's definitely Gamora.

1286
01:30:43,703 --> 01:30:49,323
TRAVIS: I should ask her her name, you know. I'm
going to be right on her in a second.

1287
01:30:49,323 --> 01:30:51,237
SAM: Maybe she has a nametag.

1288
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:53,376
MATT: So, that ends Vax's turn. Percy, you're up.

1289
01:30:53,376 --> 01:30:59,987
TALIESIN: There's not much I can do, so I'm going
to run towards that next set of buildings and

1290
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:05,118
recover next to the fountain. That you can't see.

1291
01:31:05,118 --> 01:31:07,047
MATT: Which way? This way?

1292
01:31:07,047 --> 01:31:08,564
TALIESIN: Nope, the other way.

1293
01:31:08,564 --> 01:31:10,160
MATT: Okay, so you're going to run over this way?

1294
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:16,492
TALIESIN: Yep, I'm going to burn the whole thing
and then, see that fountain right there? Full

1295
01:31:16,492 --> 01:31:21,609
movement. Okay, not that far, the other side of
the fountain. I'm hiding in that corner.

1296
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:25,114
MATT: Okay, good. That ends your turn.

1297
01:31:25,114 --> 01:31:28,307
TALIESIN: That actually-- did that burn my
action?

1298
01:31:28,307 --> 01:31:32,792
MATT: To get there, that'd have to be a dash. It's
a move and dash.

1299
01:31:32,792 --> 01:31:39,621
TALIESIN: Actually, how far could I have gone
without burning my action? I'm so sorry.

1300
01:31:39,621 --> 01:31:41,666
MATT: You would have gotten onto the bridge
there.

1301
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:48,168
SAM: Stay true to yourself, Taliesin.

1302
01:31:48,168 --> 01:31:51,446
TRAVIS: Touch yourself, Taliesin.

1303
01:31:51,446 --> 01:31:53,256
LIAM: Stay true to Percy.

1304
01:31:53,256 --> 01:31:57,510
TALIESIN: No, that's fair. I'm just trying to get
somewhere.

1305
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:16,142
MATT: All right, so. Beginning of this turn. The
pit fiend, Ghurrix, is going to then, its claws

1306
01:32:16,142 --> 01:32:22,304
dug into the side of the roof, (roars) dart
upward, wings out, in an upward arc toward Scanlan

1307
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:24,968
and Vex.

1308
01:32:24,968 --> 01:32:28,933
LAURA: Remember, I'm not directly next to him.
That's why I said I wasn't.

1309
01:32:28,933 --> 01:32:30,481
MATT: I'm moving this away.

1310
01:32:30,481 --> 01:32:35,145
TRAVIS: Let the man fly.

1311
01:32:35,145 --> 01:32:40,028
MATT: Technically, Scanlan is there, and you're
back that way because you went straight up out of

1312
01:32:40,028 --> 01:32:41,742
the entranceway. Right?

1313
01:32:41,742 --> 01:32:43,105
LAURA: Sure.

1314
01:32:43,105 --> 01:32:52,654
MATT: Right there? Takes up, you go ahead and get
the Sunbeam, and you do, yes.

1315
01:32:52,654 --> 01:32:54,894
SAM: Mine's first.

1316
01:32:54,894 --> 01:33:01,882
MATT: So as soon as it appears up in the side
there, you're doing Otiluke's Resilient Sphere?

1317
01:33:01,882 --> 01:33:03,472
SAM: Handcone up, yes.

1318
01:33:03,472 --> 01:33:13,188
MATT: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. That is a large
creature. Dexterity saving throw.

1319
01:33:13,188 --> 01:33:15,145
MARISHA: Can my sunbeam go through the sphere?

1320
01:33:15,145 --> 01:33:18,575
MATT: No, it cannot.

1321
01:33:18,575 --> 01:33:23,459
MARISHA: Can I please sunbeam first? God dammit,
Scanlan.

1322
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:26,773
MATT: It's okay. That is a 24.

1323
01:33:26,773 --> 01:33:31,152
SAM: What was the lower of those two rolls?
Because I have advantage.

1324
01:33:31,152 --> 01:33:33,308
MATT: The lower, that was 21.

1325
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:34,660
SAM: That's my DC.

1326
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,290
MATT: So he makes it.

1327
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,975
SAM: Fucking shit!

1328
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:43,626
MATT: Although technically, because he has
advantage on the saving throw and you gave him

1329
01:33:43,626 --> 01:33:49,819
disadvantage, it would've been the first roll. So
yeah, it would've been 24. Sorry. So as the sphere

1330
01:33:49,819 --> 01:33:53,676
begins to condense around him, he shatters it.
However, your Sunbeam does still--

1331
01:33:53,676 --> 01:33:56,233
MARISHA: Yeah, he's probably going to save from
that too.

1332
01:33:56,233 --> 01:33:58,105
LAURA: Just try it, man. Just try it.

1333
01:33:58,105 --> 01:34:04,623
MATT: So, as you watch him appear in the air, you
finish the spell and release the beam, arcing past

1334
01:34:04,623 --> 01:34:06,584
like a laser across the sky.

1335
01:34:06,584 --> 01:34:11,415
MARISHA: (lazer zapping) It's a constitution
saving throw.

1336
01:34:11,415 --> 01:34:20,445
MATT: Constitution saving throw? That is 19.

1337
01:34:20,445 --> 01:34:23,351
MARISHA: That's my DC.

1338
01:34:23,351 --> 01:34:24,799
MATT: So he saves it.

1339
01:34:24,799 --> 01:34:26,743
TALIESIN: Wait, wait! (mumbling)

1340
01:34:26,743 --> 01:34:30,382
MARISHA: No, that's a plus two to spell attack
rolls. I can't use my--?

1341
01:34:30,382 --> 01:34:36,037
MATT: It still hits, he just takes half damage and
isn't blinded.

1342
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:40,464
MARISHA: It's radiant damage, and he's not
blinded. Which would have been so cool.

1343
01:34:40,464 --> 01:34:44,068
MATT: So go ahead and roll your damage.

1344
01:34:44,068 --> 01:34:46,532
MARISHA: Does he take extra because it's radiant?

1345
01:34:46,532 --> 01:34:55,799
MATT: Nope. Leaps over and flies up right between
the two of you, who are hovering up like this

1346
01:34:55,799 --> 01:34:57,403
bright beacon in the sky.

1347
01:34:57,403 --> 01:35:02,395
SAM: Except I'm falling, because that was a
concentration spell. Bigby's gone.

1348
01:35:02,395 --> 01:35:04,021
MATT: Oh, that's right!

1349
01:35:04,021 --> 01:35:06,468
LAURA: That is actually going to help you, dude.

1350
01:35:06,468 --> 01:35:14,826
MATT: All righty! So you go ahead and-- Did you
make your concentration save against that?

1351
01:35:14,826 --> 01:35:17,192
SAM: My concentration save?

1352
01:35:17,192 --> 01:35:22,038
MATT: Oh, Otiluke's was, correct, yeah. So you're
falling.

1353
01:35:22,038 --> 01:35:25,437
MARISHA: He takes nine points of damage, by the
way.

1354
01:35:25,437 --> 01:35:29,441
SAM: Nine points! Yeah, Keyleth!

1355
01:35:29,441 --> 01:35:32,430
LAURA: Jesus, we're all going to die.

1356
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:39,414
MATT: So you take, Scanlan--

1357
01:35:39,414 --> 01:35:43,273
SAM: Do I get any kind of athletic move?

1358
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:45,922
MATT: No. 14 points of bludgeoning damage and--

1359
01:35:45,922 --> 01:35:49,838
SAM: Am I in the lava?

1360
01:35:49,838 --> 01:35:56,191
MATT: You are about to stumble into it. The heat
is so extreme at that point that you-- So, you

1361
01:35:56,191 --> 01:36:01,776
take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, plus an
additional ten points of fire damage due to

1362
01:36:01,776 --> 01:36:09,448
proximity to heat, as the lava's right at the heel
of your boots right now. All right. So, as it

1363
01:36:09,448 --> 01:36:10,663
lands next to you--

1364
01:36:10,663 --> 01:36:13,173
LAURA: That's going to be better for him, though,
than getting these hits.

1365
01:36:13,173 --> 01:36:15,839
MATT: It's going to unleash a full series of
attacks against you.

1366
01:36:15,839 --> 01:36:18,608
LAURA: Instead of shared, great. Yay.

1367
01:36:18,608 --> 01:36:22,055
SAM: Bye! I'll take lava, bye!

1368
01:36:22,055 --> 01:36:24,899
MATT: That's a 28.

1369
01:36:24,899 --> 01:36:26,193
LAURA: Of course.

1370
01:36:26,193 --> 01:36:27,827
MATT: With the claw attack. So, you suffer--

1371
01:36:27,827 --> 01:36:32,279
LAURA: You better use Cutting Words on him, for
one of these things.

1372
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:34,461
SAM: Aaah, the lava, I can't concentrate!

1373
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:38,628
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage for the first
one.

1374
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:40,261
MARISHA: Such a troll tonight!

1375
01:36:40,261 --> 01:37:02,987
MATT: The bite attack is 25. This here, you take
15 points of piercing damage-- Sorry, 15 plus

1376
01:37:02,987 --> 01:37:09,676
eight. So 23 points of piercing damage, total. I
need you to make a constitution saving throw.

1377
01:37:09,676 --> 01:37:16,186
LAURA: Tight. Cool, that is a four.

1378
01:37:16,186 --> 01:37:22,721
MATT: Okay, so you are now poisoned as the fangs
poison your body. You feel it pulsing through

1379
01:37:22,721 --> 01:37:23,966
yourself.

1380
01:37:23,966 --> 01:37:25,656
LAURA: Okay.

1381
01:37:25,656 --> 01:37:29,274
MATT: And you suffer--

1382
01:37:29,274 --> 01:37:34,266
LAURA: I've got to get my calculator out to find
out if I'm about to die.

1383
01:37:34,266 --> 01:37:38,334
MATT: 25 points of poison damage from failing the
save.

1384
01:37:38,334 --> 01:37:43,772
SAM: Matthew? Would I have the wherewithal to see
what's going on and try to--

1385
01:37:43,772 --> 01:37:48,946
MATT: You see white, right now, as you slam onto
your back and (groaning) the ringing in your ears

1386
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:55,287
as this is happening. The tail attack is a 29 to
hit.

1387
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:58,602
TRAVIS: I think that misses.

1388
01:37:58,602 --> 01:38:01,475
LAURA: Yeah, no, that one doesn't hit, but the
rest of them do.

1389
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:08,677
MATT: That is some bad rolls, actually. 16 points
of bludgeoning damage.

1390
01:38:08,677 --> 01:38:11,575
ASHLEY: That's <i>enough</i>.

1391
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:16,063
MATT: And the mace. 25 to hit on the mace.

1392
01:38:16,063 --> 01:38:18,699
LAURA: Okay, yeah, cool, tight.

1393
01:38:18,699 --> 01:38:28,376
MATT: So, you suffer 18 points of bludgeoning
damage, so mark that.

1394
01:38:28,376 --> 01:38:30,454
LAURA: Oh, I thought that's what I just did?

1395
01:38:30,454 --> 01:38:32,562
MATT: Well, you took another 18 from the mace
hitting you.

1396
01:38:32,562 --> 01:38:35,014
LAURA: He got four attacks, right?

1397
01:38:35,014 --> 01:38:38,971
MATT: Yeah, this is the last attack. So, 18
plus--

1398
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:44,444
LAURA: Right? That was already the 18? Or was it?

1399
01:38:44,444 --> 01:38:47,065
SAM: Well, some of the attacks, they add more
poison to it.

1400
01:38:47,065 --> 01:38:49,949
LAURA: Oh, jesus. Okay.

1401
01:38:49,949 --> 01:38:57,402
MATT: So you took the 18 bludgeoning damage, plus
an additional 15 points of fire damage.

1402
01:38:57,402 --> 01:38:59,518
LAURA: Cool, I'm unconscious.

1403
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:08,984
MATT: With that, all of a sudden you watch as the
mace slams Vex in the side. Her form goes limp,

1404
01:39:08,984 --> 01:39:12,547
arcing through the air. The broom spinning off and
scattering across--

1405
01:39:12,547 --> 01:39:15,734
LAURA: No, it's attached to me. It is attached.

1406
01:39:15,734 --> 01:39:25,643
MATT: So, it's spinning and scattering behind you
as you arc over at the impact, that way--

1407
01:39:25,643 --> 01:39:27,789
ASHLEY: Right by me.

1408
01:39:27,789 --> 01:39:32,495
MATT: I'm going to roll a scatter die on this.

1409
01:39:32,495 --> 01:39:36,403
SAM: Scatter die! What is that?

1410
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:45,176
MATT: That's a three. You arc this way, so you
fall and land onto the stonework, there.

1411
01:39:45,176 --> 01:39:46,799
LAURA: Right next to Pike!

1412
01:39:46,799 --> 01:39:52,568
MARISHA: You got your wish! Her body just landed
at your feet.

1413
01:39:52,568 --> 01:39:55,843
LAURA: Does that mean that's an automatic death
save failure, though?

1414
01:39:55,843 --> 01:39:59,965
MATT: From the fall and impact, yeah. So you
automatically suffer one failed death saving

1415
01:39:59,965 --> 01:40:06,563
throw, from the impact. Pike, you watch as Vex,
crack! onto the stonework there, one of her legs

1416
01:40:06,563 --> 01:40:08,578
hanging off to the side.

1417
01:40:08,578 --> 01:40:15,702
LAURA: Oh, off of the stonework, not off of my
body. I was like, just like that, huh?

1418
01:40:15,702 --> 01:40:21,668
MATT: No, you smack. There's no bounce to this.
Might've been worse if it had.

1419
01:40:21,668 --> 01:40:23,151
MARISHA: It's like Left 4 Dead physics.

1420
01:40:23,151 --> 01:40:31,985
MATT: Yeah, kinda. Just, crack! So that's going to
end the pit fiend's turn. The erinyes is--

1421
01:40:31,985 --> 01:40:35,642
LIAM: That was a Dickens novel.

1422
01:40:35,642 --> 01:40:40,245
MATT: She's going to attempt to move away from
you. She does not want to be close to you.

1423
01:40:40,245 --> 01:40:44,263
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I am really a nice guy, when
you get to-- <i>Get the fuck over here.</i>

1424
01:40:44,263 --> 01:40:46,824
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and take your attack of
opportunity.

1425
01:40:46,824 --> 01:40:59,481
TRAVIS: Reckless, great. I'm going to give this a
29 minus five, is a 24.

1426
01:40:59,481 --> 01:41:01,258
MATT: 24, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1427
01:41:01,258 --> 01:41:05,933
SAM: We're having a fight! Oh, oh sorry.

1428
01:41:05,933 --> 01:41:20,060
TRAVIS: Five points of necrotic, (adding) 38. Oh,
oh, oh! Enlarged. 39.

1429
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:29,016
MATT: Nice. Darts off this way and, taking the
impact, you see she's starting to look a little

1430
01:41:29,016 --> 01:41:40,089
rough. Pulls in the side with her longbow. She's
going to take three shots at-- you're on the

1431
01:41:40,089 --> 01:42:00,441
ground, you just fell out of the sky and impacted.
She's going to take three shots at Scanlan.

1432
01:42:00,441 --> 01:42:05,277
Actually, you're prone on the ground, so you're
going to be harder for her to hit. Three shots at

1433
01:42:05,277 --> 01:42:13,120
Keyleth. That is a 28 to hit.

1434
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,523
MARISHA: Heh, yeah.

1435
01:42:14,523 --> 01:42:19,902
MATT: That is a 19 to hit.

1436
01:42:19,902 --> 01:42:21,523
MARISHA: Yep.

1437
01:42:21,523 --> 01:42:23,660
MATT: 18 to hit.

1438
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:28,496
MARISHA: Does inspiration help negate? All three
hit.

1439
01:42:28,496 --> 01:42:40,401
MATT: All three hit, okay. So you suffer, let's
see. Each one of these is poisoned. I need you to

1440
01:42:40,401 --> 01:42:42,654
make a constitution saving throw, by the way.

1441
01:42:42,654 --> 01:42:44,063
MARISHA: Just one?

1442
01:42:44,063 --> 01:42:46,712
MATT: Three, technically.

1443
01:42:46,712 --> 01:42:51,080
LAURA: Don't forget, Scanlan, you've been getting
five extra hit points at the start of your turn.

1444
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:55,560
MATT: Scanlan does not.

1445
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,744
LAURA: Oh, it's just the hit point max, okay.

1446
01:42:57,744 --> 01:42:59,899
MATT: Yeah, but Scanlan also lost that because he
cast it on the--

1447
01:42:59,899 --> 01:43:02,706
MARISHA: Oh that's right, I've got that, at the
top of my turn.

1448
01:43:02,706 --> 01:43:05,343
SAM: Wait, but she did something.

1449
01:43:05,343 --> 01:43:07,035
LAURA: Yeah, Pike cast Aid.

1450
01:43:07,035 --> 01:43:09,460
MATT: You would actually have probably lost
concentration on that when you took all the

1451
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:10,452
damage.

1452
01:43:10,452 --> 01:43:11,562
LIAM: Did I roll for that?

1453
01:43:11,562 --> 01:43:15,699
MATT: I forgot to do that, because I'm not used to
you casting. Roll four constitution saving throws.

1454
01:43:15,699 --> 01:43:23,057
LIAM: Ha, I'm sure I lost it. How do I do this?
First one's a natural 20.

1455
01:43:23,057 --> 01:43:25,780
SAM: Just three more natural 20s.

1456
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:28,570
MATT: Your constitution saving throw.

1457
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:37,183
LIAM: Oh, the zero? Cool. 19. 15. 16.

1458
01:43:37,183 --> 01:43:40,931
MATT: Yeah, we'll say you maintained it.

1459
01:43:40,931 --> 01:43:43,431
(cheering)

1460
01:43:43,431 --> 01:43:54,688
MARISHA: Okay, first one was 21. Second one's 15.
Third one, heh, is a natural one.

1461
01:43:54,688 --> 01:44:07,540
MATT: Okay, so you are poisoned. So you take, on
all three hits, the first one is going to be 17

1462
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:26,104
points of damage. That was crazy, I rolled four
sevens. 28 for the second hit. 18 for the third

1463
01:44:26,104 --> 01:44:31,140
hit. So there you go.

1464
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,973
MARISHA: Okay.

1465
01:44:32,973 --> 01:44:40,313
TALIESIN: She's not fine, but she's not down.

1466
01:44:40,313 --> 01:44:47,170
MATT: And then the erinyes ducks behind the side,
there, to try and gain some cover off the wall.

1467
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:51,042
That's going to bring us to Scanlan.

1468
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:53,700
SAM: Me? What happened to Percy?

1469
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:57,943
TRAVIS: Pike's next. I mean, Pike is after you.

1470
01:44:57,943 --> 01:45:09,409
SAM: Oh, because I was holding my turn. So now
we're up to me? Okay. Oh, great, this is fun. I'll

1471
01:45:09,409 --> 01:45:24,383
stand up out of the lava. There's a guy above me,
right? The pit fiend? Wow, that's fun. Yep, okay,

1472
01:45:24,383 --> 01:45:39,428
sure. Wait, who's dead? Okay, I'll Healing Word
the dead person, the Vex. I will sing to her,

1473
01:45:39,428 --> 01:45:49,707
(singing) Don't you give up, no, no, no! I won't
give up, no, no, no! Let me heal you! Let me heal you!

1474
01:45:49,707 --> 01:45:51,977
TRAVIS: The harmony on that was--

1475
01:45:51,977 --> 01:45:53,477
LAURA: That was amazing.

1476
01:45:53,477 --> 01:46:02,446
SAM: That's a d4 plus six. That's so weak. Okay,
you got seven points.

1477
01:46:02,446 --> 01:46:04,934
LAURA: Hey, thanks, man! Now me and Keyleth have
the same amount of hit points!

1478
01:46:04,934 --> 01:46:07,857
MARISHA: Lucky number seven!

1479
01:46:07,857 --> 01:46:19,749
SAM: I will move away from the sniper fire, so
where Taliesin used to be, where Percy used to be.

1480
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:23,549
MATT: That's as far as you can get, is right
there.

1481
01:46:23,549 --> 01:46:25,835
SAM: That's fine, just as long as the sniper can't
get me.

1482
01:46:25,835 --> 01:46:30,071
MATT: The sniper can still get you. With 25
movement, you can't get far enough away, unless

1483
01:46:30,071 --> 01:46:32,467
you want to use your action to dash.

1484
01:46:32,467 --> 01:46:40,146
SAM: No thank you. How high, he would be--?

1485
01:46:40,146 --> 01:46:43,487
MATT: Actually, technically, you used half your
movement for prone, so you can only get that far.

1486
01:46:43,487 --> 01:46:45,756
SAM: Oh. Is there anything I can hide behind?

1487
01:46:45,756 --> 01:46:47,019
MATT: Currently, no.

1488
01:46:47,019 --> 01:46:48,642
SAM: Can I hide behind Pike?

1489
01:46:48,642 --> 01:46:50,503
MATT: You can't get that far.

1490
01:46:50,503 --> 01:46:53,508
SAM: Jump in the lava?

1491
01:46:53,508 --> 01:46:55,561
MATT: If you want to.

1492
01:46:55,561 --> 01:47:09,792
SAM: Okay, let's just say that, shit. Yep, I don't
know what to do. Well, if I can't move out of the

1493
01:47:09,792 --> 01:47:16,777
way then I'll try to Lightning Bolt the pit fiend.
I mean, we're trying to kill the pit fiend, right?

1494
01:47:16,777 --> 01:47:21,039
That's not going to do shit to a pit fiend.

1495
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:23,022
LAURA: Can you try the sphere again?

1496
01:47:23,022 --> 01:47:28,903
SAM: Pit fiend would be 45 feet up, right? So I
cannot, because I can only get 30 feet. I could

1497
01:47:28,903 --> 01:47:30,210
hop and do it.

1498
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:31,759
ASHLEY: Is he looking rough?

1499
01:47:31,759 --> 01:47:35,434
LAURA: No, not even close. But <i>she</i> is! She's
looking a little torn up.

1500
01:47:35,434 --> 01:47:37,918
TRAVIS: But she's further away.

1501
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:41,979
SAM: I will hold my action until the pit fiend
comes in range.

1502
01:47:41,979 --> 01:47:43,200
MATT: And what are you going to do?

1503
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,118
SAM: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

1504
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:48,663
TALIESIN: That's a great idea.

1505
01:47:48,663 --> 01:47:51,155
LIAM: (singing) If at first you don't succeed--

1506
01:47:51,155 --> 01:47:53,144
TRAVIS: Give up and run away.

1507
01:47:53,144 --> 01:47:56,038
LAURA: Yeah. Oh my god, this is a serious thing,
though.

1508
01:47:56,038 --> 01:47:59,233
MATT: Okay, so. Scanlan's holding his turn. Pike,
what are you doing?

1509
01:47:59,233 --> 01:48:04,001
ASHLEY: Okay, am I even near Keyleth at all, or
no?

1510
01:48:04,001 --> 01:48:11,127
MATT: You're about roughly 50 feet from her.

1511
01:48:11,127 --> 01:48:16,535
AHSLEY: So, if I go in the middle, can I do a Mass
Cure Wounds?

1512
01:48:16,535 --> 01:48:18,616
MATT: You could, yeah.

1513
01:48:18,616 --> 01:48:20,917
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to do that.

1514
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:30,190
MATT: What's the range on Mass Cure Wounds? Range
of 60 feet. Oh, in a 30 foot radius. So you'd have

1515
01:48:30,190 --> 01:48:37,440
to move, you can get about there, move around
Scanlan, and you can get Scanlan, Vex, and

1516
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,099
Keyleth, if you wanted to.

1517
01:48:39,099 --> 01:48:42,984
ASHLEY: Fantastic. Big money, big money.

1518
01:48:42,984 --> 01:48:45,494
MARISHA: Come on, winner winner.

1519
01:48:45,494 --> 01:48:51,946
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to do it at sixth level.

1520
01:48:51,946 --> 01:48:54,587
MATT: All right, so that's 4d8 plus five.

1521
01:48:54,587 --> 01:48:59,658
ASHLEY: Plus my spellcasting?

1522
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:01,781
MATT: Well, that's the plus five.

1523
01:49:01,781 --> 01:49:08,569
ASHLEY: That's the plus five. Okay, so 4d8. Shit,
that's not a lot. Ooh!

1524
01:49:08,569 --> 01:49:14,053
TRAVIS: That d8's very exciting.

1525
01:49:14,053 --> 01:49:19,353
SAM: Am I affected by this? I'm going to get
health?

1526
01:49:19,353 --> 01:49:20,918
LAURA: You're going to get healed.

1527
01:49:20,918 --> 01:49:22,795
TRAVIS: Have you been hit?

1528
01:49:22,795 --> 01:49:25,692
SAM: Yeah. Well, I hit myself by falling out of
the sky.

1529
01:49:25,692 --> 01:49:29,192
ASHLEY: Okay, 31.

1530
01:49:29,192 --> 01:49:34,476
MATT: Okay, so 31 hit points healed to Scanlan,
Keyleth, and Vex.

1531
01:49:34,476 --> 01:49:39,548
SAM: Do I get the temporary hit points that Pike
had granted me, two turns ago?

1532
01:49:39,548 --> 01:49:42,182
MATT: The Aid one? Yeah, you still have that,
technically.

1533
01:49:42,182 --> 01:49:46,227
SAM: She gave me five. Okay, great.

1534
01:49:46,227 --> 01:49:54,013
ASHLEY: As my bonus action, can I move the
Spiritual Weapon any closer to the pit fiend? Do I

1535
01:49:54,013 --> 01:49:55,063
see him now?

1536
01:49:55,063 --> 01:49:57,592
MATT: You can. It won't get close enough to fight,
but it does move a little closer.

1537
01:49:57,592 --> 01:49:59,395
ASHLEY: Just to taunt him a little?

1538
01:49:59,395 --> 01:50:01,027
MATT: Sure. It'll be about there.

1539
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:03,890
LAURA: Just wave it around, like, woo.

1540
01:50:03,890 --> 01:50:09,895
MATT: Yeah. We'll say it's a little ways back. He
needs to move a little bit closer. All right, that

1541
01:50:09,895 --> 01:50:17,589
ends your turn? Okay, at this point in time, as
you're paying attention, Percy, as you're around

1542
01:50:17,589 --> 01:50:23,482
the corner, looking up and seeing the fiend right
there, you glance over to the right at the top of

1543
01:50:23,482 --> 01:50:30,384
the round as you watch one of the Illuminated
begin making its way that way.

1544
01:50:30,384 --> 01:50:31,973
TALIESIN: He's that close, already?

1545
01:50:31,973 --> 01:50:45,282
MATT: It starts coasting up the side. It's
coasting through, seeing all these things going

1546
01:50:45,282 --> 01:50:50,847
off, spells and shit. You see it cruising through
the air, a little bit high up, and is just

1547
01:50:50,847 --> 01:50:56,879
arriving on the scene here, taking in the visual
perspective here. As soon as it turns around the

1548
01:50:56,879 --> 01:51:02,777
corner, it looks at you, looks at everything
happening, and its hand goes for its weapon,

1549
01:51:02,777 --> 01:51:09,207
looking at all of you surrounding it. Currently,
it appears to recognize the individual up above,

1550
01:51:09,207 --> 01:51:12,867
and you all not being from here.

1551
01:51:12,867 --> 01:51:19,192
SAM: But I look really cool with a fire beard and
stuff, so.

1552
01:51:19,192 --> 01:51:20,780
MATT: Yeah.

1553
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:22,569
SAM: I look cool.

1554
01:51:22,569 --> 01:51:29,021
MATT: You do. It sees a bunch of Vexes and Vaxes,
essentially. A bunch of slaves rising up against a

1555
01:51:29,021 --> 01:51:34,854
pit fiend, is what it's seeing. So, top of the
round, Vex. You are prone, but conscious.

1556
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:38,433
LAURA: Okay. I get up.

1557
01:51:38,433 --> 01:51:41,889
MATT: All right, so that's half your movement
there. You're still poisoned.

1558
01:51:41,889 --> 01:51:51,318
LAURA: Oh, then I'm going to cast Protection from
Poison on myself. Wow, as my action. Well, what

1559
01:51:51,318 --> 01:51:55,339
are you going to do? That cancels out the poison.

1560
01:51:55,339 --> 01:52:03,212
MATT: All right, yeah, so you are no longer
poisoned. That is your action.

1561
01:52:03,212 --> 01:52:07,440
LAURA: Then I want to, as my bonus action--

1562
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:12,072
MATT: By the way, by going unconscious, you lost
your Hunter's Mark.

1563
01:52:12,072 --> 01:52:31,320
LAURA: Of course I did. As my bonus action, I'm
going to take-- I don't know. I have a bag of gems

1564
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:40,391
of my own. I'm going to pull out from my thing,
and toss it at the efreet, and say, we're more

1565
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:43,970
than we look, and we need your help. Hope that it
bribes him.

1566
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:46,458
MATT: Okay, make a persuasion roll.

1567
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:50,362
SAM: Mid-battle bribery!

1568
01:52:50,362 --> 01:53:01,628
LAURA: Persuasion, persuasion. 21.

1569
01:53:01,628 --> 01:53:08,271
MATT: You toss the gems, they scatter across the
ground in front of this efreeti, holding its

1570
01:53:08,271 --> 01:53:15,871
weapon to the side. He just snarls. All right,
that ends your turn? Unless you want to move from

1571
01:53:15,871 --> 01:53:19,490
your current position. You have half your movement
now, so you can move 15 feet.

1572
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:27,268
LAURA: I'm going to move-- Is it stupid to move
into the mansion?

1573
01:53:27,268 --> 01:53:28,441
TRAVIS: No.

1574
01:53:28,441 --> 01:53:29,860
LAURA: I'm going to move into the mansion.

1575
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:31,971
MATT: Okay, you move into the mansion.

1576
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:33,782
SAM: Thanks for abandoning us!

1577
01:53:33,782 --> 01:53:36,564
MATT: All righty, that ends Vex's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

1578
01:53:36,564 --> 01:53:41,117
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to Sunbeam him again.

1579
01:53:41,117 --> 01:53:49,074
MATT: Okay, so saving throw. That would be 24.

1580
01:53:49,074 --> 01:53:59,782
SAM: So we all saw Vex wake up, throw a bag of
money, and walk into my house. Very unusual. With

1581
01:53:59,782 --> 01:54:02,561
a broom dragging behind her.

1582
01:54:02,561 --> 01:54:09,481
LAURA: Trinket's going to run and stand next to
Pike, to protect her.

1583
01:54:09,481 --> 01:54:11,142
MATT: All righty.

1584
01:54:11,142 --> 01:54:15,925
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into an air elemental.

1585
01:54:15,925 --> 01:54:18,610
MATT: Well, how much damage does it deal? It still
takes half damage.

1586
01:54:18,610 --> 01:54:24,520
MARISHA: Right. Just a game of attrition, at this
point.

1587
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:34,314
SAM: Oh boy, guys, this is a fight.

1588
01:54:34,314 --> 01:55:02,644
MARISHA: Hang on, sorry, trying to do math.
(adding) 33 divided in half, so, shit. 11! No, 12!

1589
01:55:02,644 --> 01:55:05,760
33? 16!

1590
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,395
MATT: 16 points of radiant damage.

1591
01:55:08,395 --> 01:55:09,501
MARISHA: I'm really nervous!

1592
01:55:09,501 --> 01:55:11,452
MATT: You drop the poison.
When you go into your air elemental form, as your

1593
01:55:11,452 --> 01:55:13,799
bonus action, the poison is cast out of your form.
So you're no longer poisoned.

1594
01:55:13,799 --> 01:55:25,854
MARISHA: I still have movement, right?

1595
01:55:25,854 --> 01:55:32,355
MATT: Yes. Real fast, just to make sure, I keep
forgetting. The Sunbeam you had, and you took a

1596
01:55:32,355 --> 01:55:36,004
bunch of hits from the erinyes? The damage you
took from the erinyes. I need you to roll three

1597
01:55:36,004 --> 01:55:40,622
constitution saving throws. I need to remember to
do this. It's a lot to remember, guys. My

1598
01:55:40,622 --> 01:55:42,000
apologies.

1599
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,265
TRAVIS: As a result of the--

1600
01:55:44,265 --> 01:55:46,831
MATT: Damage that she took from the arrows,
earlier.

1601
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:56,539
MARISHA: That's 18 for the first one. Ooh, not
good. Not good at all. Seven.

1602
01:55:56,539 --> 01:56:01,266
MATT: All right, so in theory the Sunbeam would
already have gone away before--

1603
01:56:01,266 --> 01:56:03,700
MARISHA: Can I use inspiration on that?

1604
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:04,880
SAM: 12.

1605
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,806
MARISHA: Plus 12? Another seven! So 14!

1606
01:56:08,806 --> 01:56:13,098
MATT: 14? That's fine.

1607
01:56:13,098 --> 01:56:20,198
MARISHA: Okay, and then last one, last one. 13.

1608
01:56:20,198 --> 01:56:23,972
MATT: What was the damage you took from the third
arrow?

1609
01:56:23,972 --> 01:56:27,404
MARISHA: I don't know.

1610
01:56:27,404 --> 01:56:29,220
MATT: Did you write down the damage you took?

1611
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:32,639
MARISHA: I did, I took it as I went, and then I
erased it.

1612
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:40,243
MATT: Okay, I'll say, I don't think any attack did
more than 26 to you-- It's my own fault for

1613
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:48,535
forgetting. It's fine. So you maintain your
Sunbeam. We're good. All righty, so. You turn into an

1614
01:56:48,535 --> 01:56:50,803
air elemental. Do you want to move or stay where
you are?

1615
01:56:50,803 --> 01:56:55,531
MARSIAH: Yeah, I want to start heading up,
gliding. I have a fly speed of 90, right? Can I

1616
01:56:55,531 --> 01:56:56,768
get up to her?

1617
01:56:56,768 --> 01:57:04,368
MATT: You can. There you go. That ends your turn.
All righty, Grog.

1618
01:57:04,368 --> 01:57:16,167
TRAVIS: Why does no one want to stay and play with
me?! Can I step up on the ledge, like an assassin

1619
01:57:16,167 --> 01:57:23,066
from Assassin's Creed, attach the Chain of
Returning to my axe, and throw it at the back of

1620
01:57:23,066 --> 01:57:24,618
the pit fiend?

1621
01:57:24,618 --> 01:57:26,986
MATT: Totally. Go for it.

1622
01:57:26,986 --> 01:57:30,784
TRAVIS: Reckless! But not great weapon master.

1623
01:57:30,784 --> 01:57:32,398
MATT: Right.

1624
01:57:32,398 --> 01:57:40,109
TRAVIS: 24.

1625
01:57:40,109 --> 01:57:49,642
MATT: All right. That hits. Go ahead and roll
damage on that.

1626
01:57:49,642 --> 01:58:01,482
TRAVIS: Right. Four points of necrotic, 28. Oh,
plus I'm enlarged. 29.

1627
01:58:01,482 --> 01:58:08,141
MATT: 29 points of damage. The axe jams and embeds
itself into the back. The pit fiend is like

1628
01:58:08,141 --> 01:58:14,998
(snarling). The voice once again emanates from its
telepathic push into your respective brains in the

1629
01:58:14,998 --> 01:58:22,768
vicinity. "You have angered the city guard. You
have no victory now."

1630
01:58:22,768 --> 01:58:29,615
TRAVIS: Well, I'm not going to do any good up
here. I still have my movement, right? I'm going to try

1631
01:58:29,615 --> 01:58:35,580
some stupid shit. Since the axe is in his back,
can I Indiana Jones down to the ground?

1632
01:58:35,580 --> 01:58:42,496
(singing Indiana Jones theme song)

1633
01:58:42,496 --> 01:58:48,371
Just, (yelling) trying to get down to the ground
or underneath him. I may hit the ground, but maybe

1634
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:49,740
it will be slowed by the--?

1635
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:52,795
MATT: I need you to roll an acrobatics check to
land this.

1636
01:58:52,795 --> 01:58:54,198
TRAVIS: I understand.

1637
01:58:54,198 --> 01:59:01,014
MATT: You are heavy, and the chain itself is going
to come loose as you come down, so roll an

1638
01:59:01,014 --> 01:59:03,079
acrobatics check.

1639
01:59:03,079 --> 01:59:07,758
TRAVIS: Not great. Nine.

1640
01:59:07,758 --> 01:59:18,012
MATT: You swing, and you land. You stumble. You
roll and land straight into the lava.

1641
01:59:18,012 --> 01:59:22,202
TRAVIS: (yells)

1642
01:59:22,202 --> 01:59:26,632
MARISHA: Holy shit!

1643
01:59:26,632 --> 01:59:28,217
MATT: Okay.

1644
01:59:28,217 --> 01:59:36,141
LIAM: Think of the burn scars. You'll look so
cool.

1645
01:59:36,141 --> 01:59:39,519
LAURA: Oh no, why is he looking at something?

1646
01:59:39,519 --> 01:59:43,075
MATT: I'm going to check one thing in here, real
fast. There actually is, as I found out later on,

1647
01:59:43,075 --> 01:59:49,655
there is a rule for lava damage. I want to make
sure.

1648
01:59:49,655 --> 01:59:58,111
SAM: Guys, why did we come to the fire plane?

1649
01:59:58,111 --> 02:00:02,721
LAURA: Because we need that Dawnmartyr!

1650
02:00:02,721 --> 02:00:09,372
TRAVIS: It's not like an embankment down to the
lava, right? It's just a river of lava, right?

1651
02:00:09,372 --> 02:00:12,954
SAM: Maybe the lava is a secret passage! Grog, you
should swim down and find out!

1652
02:00:12,954 --> 02:00:15,615
TRAVIS: It's like a hidden Mario level!

1653
02:00:15,615 --> 02:00:21,103
MATT: Sorry, I'm looking this up now.

1654
02:00:21,103 --> 02:00:26,224
SAM: Guys, should I read another limerick while
he's doing this?

1655
02:00:26,224 --> 02:00:28,827
LAURA: I mean, it was so lovely the last time.

1656
02:00:28,827 --> 02:00:34,336
TALIESIN: You know, there are actually chapters
by--

1657
02:00:34,336 --> 02:00:40,402
TRAVIS: That's bad? I'm just going to do the T2 as
I sink into the lava.

1658
02:00:40,402 --> 02:00:44,073
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and use a dice roller
on this one.

1659
02:00:44,073 --> 02:00:47,603
LAURA: Because it's that many dice?

1660
02:00:47,603 --> 02:00:50,417
MARISHA: Oh, jeez!

1661
02:00:50,417 --> 02:00:55,536
TRAVIS: I mean, I stood in lava before, with Gern.
It didn't hurt that much.

1662
02:00:55,536 --> 02:01:02,810
LAURA: Yeah, it didn't, but this is different than
the lava we've been in before?

1663
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:08,175
MATT: This is in the Plane of Fire, and this is
the real rules for lava damage, as opposed to

1664
02:01:08,175 --> 02:01:13,352
mine, made up earlier and not fully considering
the complications. So you suffer 63 points of fire

1665
02:01:13,352 --> 02:01:14,812
damage, Grog.

1666
02:01:14,812 --> 02:01:16,557
TRAVIS: 63, thank you.

1667
02:01:16,557 --> 02:01:31,842
MATT: As you are currently Terminator-ing it into
the lava right now. So that ends your turn? Vax,

1668
02:01:31,842 --> 02:01:32,836
you're up.

1669
02:01:32,836 --> 02:01:36,370
LIAM: All right, I figure I can see Keyleth and
the winged lady, so I'm going to beeline right to

1670
02:01:36,370 --> 02:01:40,672
the other side of the enemy and flank her.

1671
02:01:40,672 --> 02:01:41,727
MATT: Over here?

1672
02:01:41,727 --> 02:01:48,774
LIAm: Yeah, up to the wall. (impact) Dagger dagger
dagger. So flanking, advantage. First attack is a

1673
02:01:48,774 --> 02:01:50,419
26.

1674
02:01:50,419 --> 02:01:52,250
MATT: 26 hits.

1675
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:54,806
LIAM: Second attack is a 19.

1676
02:01:54,806 --> 02:01:59,897
MATT: She's going to pull her longsword out and
parry to the side. The second attack does not hit.

1677
02:01:59,897 --> 02:02:02,661
LIAM: How does that work? She automatically does
it?

1678
02:02:02,661 --> 02:02:04,684
MATT: She adds a plus four to her AC.

1679
02:02:04,684 --> 02:02:13,436
LIAM: Plus four? I'm going to use, nah. Okay. Then
the third attack is a 32.

1680
02:02:13,436 --> 02:02:14,913
MATT: Okay.

1681
02:02:14,913 --> 02:02:33,233
LIAM: Okay, so first and third. The first one gets
the sneak attack. So that is (adding) 29, plus

1682
02:02:33,233 --> 02:02:39,901
the psychic damage, gets 32. That's the one that
sneak attacks. Then the other one, the regular

1683
02:02:39,901 --> 02:02:50,157
one, where'd my pyramid go? Gets a ten. So a
total of 42 between the two attacks.

1684
02:02:50,157 --> 02:02:55,247
MATT: Oof, nice. So, as you dart up around and
land to the side, as you jam the blade into her

1685
02:02:55,247 --> 02:03:02,036
side, she gasps out and you can feel the strange,
burning warmth of her blood on your hand. She's

1686
02:03:02,036 --> 02:03:15,405
not doing too well. All right, that ends your
turn? All right, Percy.

1687
02:03:15,405 --> 02:03:22,905
LIAM: Shoot to kill, baby. Do it, golden snitch.

1688
02:03:22,905 --> 02:03:32,552
TALIESIN: Oh boy, okay. Oh, this is so bad. All
right.

1689
02:03:32,552 --> 02:03:42,402
MATT: In your visual range right now, you have the
pit fiend up in the air, you have the efreeti that

1690
02:03:42,402 --> 02:03:47,231
just arrived, that is currently assessing the
situation and is not favorable in your path right now.

1691
02:03:47,231 --> 02:03:56,463
SAM: He passes, again.

1692
02:03:56,463 --> 02:04:07,617
TALIESIN: This is such a phenomenally interesting
disaster. No, okay, I've got some plans. I'm going to--

1693
02:04:07,617 --> 02:04:11,859
SAM: I'm going to construct a small lever system.

1694
02:04:11,859 --> 02:04:25,103
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and get him to
drop his, ah, fuck. Yeah, fuck it, I'm going to

1695
02:04:25,103 --> 02:04:26,642
get him to drop his mace.

1696
02:04:26,642 --> 02:04:32,080
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a good move. That mace sucks
all the balls.

1697
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:40,672
TALIESIN: So I'm taking that shot with
sharpshooter. Actually, no, you know what? No,

1698
02:04:40,672 --> 02:04:47,067
just straight, clean. Yeah, that'll do. 24.

1699
02:04:47,067 --> 02:04:51,351
MATT: 24 hits. Strength save to try and--?

1700
02:04:51,351 --> 02:04:54,568
TALIESIN: That's a strength save against, I
believe, 18.

1701
02:04:54,568 --> 02:04:56,568
MATT: That's a 27.

1702
02:04:56,568 --> 02:05:05,692
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I don't even know why I
bothered. But at the very least, that is ten

1703
02:05:05,692 --> 02:05:09,102
regular points of damage, two psychic damage, and
six necrotic damage.

1704
02:05:09,102 --> 02:05:10,696
MATT: Okay.

1705
02:05:10,696 --> 02:05:23,973
TALIESIN: I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to hold
off on that for a little bit.

1706
02:05:23,973 --> 02:05:31,709
LAURA: Loot Crate!

1707
02:05:31,709 --> 02:05:38,822
TALIESIN: I'm so horrified by this entire-- I'm
going to take another shot at him, straight, with

1708
02:05:38,822 --> 02:05:49,613
sharpshooter. Nope, that goes really, really
poorly. That misfires, and I take, ooh, yeah, no.

1709
02:05:49,613 --> 02:06:06,072
This may work. Okay. I take six points of psychic
damage. So I take six points of psychic damage,

1710
02:06:06,072 --> 02:06:19,452
and I scream, they're mad, I'm mad, we're all mad!
It's driving us mad! Help us! Help us all! And I

1711
02:06:19,452 --> 02:06:27,375
scream, holding my head and running into the door.
Seeing if I can fake out the djinn to thinking

1712
02:06:27,375 --> 02:06:29,940
that maybe things are a little complicated.

1713
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:35,122
MATT: All right, make a deception check.

1714
02:06:35,122 --> 02:06:39,067
TALIESIN: Do I get advantage on that?

1715
02:06:39,067 --> 02:06:40,055
MATT: No.

1716
02:06:40,055 --> 02:06:46,524
TALISIN: God damn it. Okay, that'll do. 19.

1717
02:06:46,524 --> 02:07:00,006
MATT: Okay. As you come charging through the
doorway, you guys watch as Percy's form disappears

1718
02:07:00,006 --> 02:07:09,141
into the space, which is immediately followed by a
heavy slamming sound as the pit fiend, like a

1719
02:07:09,141 --> 02:07:19,306
Keyteor, drops right there, on the ground, right
next to Pike and Scanlan. It shouts over its

1720
02:07:19,306 --> 02:07:32,033
shoulder, "Call your men!" as it emanates from its
psychic wave of telekinetic speech, "Call your

1721
02:07:32,033 --> 02:07:40,181
"men! I need aid." Going to unload on the beacon of
divinity that stands before it, that has healed--

1722
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:43,236
SAM: Unless it is trapped in my sphere.

1723
02:07:43,236 --> 02:07:51,706
MATT: So, as it moves into the space, what's the
save on that again?

1724
02:07:51,706 --> 02:07:59,878
SAM: 21 if I'm using my cone, which was up for my
last one. I did not Cutting Words on this one, so

1725
02:07:59,878 --> 02:08:01,375
he's got advantage.

1726
02:08:01,375 --> 02:08:16,451
MATT: That is a 22. Plus eight to his dex saving
throw there. He has resistance. He slams onto the

1727
02:08:16,451 --> 02:08:17,794
ground.

1728
02:08:17,794 --> 02:08:24,555
ASHLEY: I'm going to wave at him.

1729
02:08:24,555 --> 02:08:33,780
MATT: As you wave at him, Pike, he makes his claw
attack against you. That is a 19 plus, that's a 34

1730
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:34,810
to hit.

1731
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:35,997
LIAM: Does that hit, Ashley?

1732
02:08:35,997 --> 02:08:37,453
ASHLEY: No! It doesn't hit!

1733
02:08:37,453 --> 02:08:40,037
(laughter)

1734
02:08:40,037 --> 02:08:50,693
MATT: So that is 20 points of slashing damage,
Ashley. It's going to attempt to bite you. It's a

1735
02:08:50,693 --> 02:09:10,687
natural 20 on the bite. That's not good, at all.
That is 40 points of piercing damage, Ashley, and

1736
02:09:10,687 --> 02:09:13,223
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

1737
02:09:13,223 --> 02:09:15,949
LIAM: Matthew Mercer, keeping us humble since
2013.

1738
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:20,520
LAURA: He's really enjoying himself. TPK tonight,
guys.

1739
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:25,958
ASHLEY: Oh, boy, that's bad. I got an eight.

1740
02:09:25,958 --> 02:09:44,372
MATT: All right, so you also suffer, as the poison
courses through your body, that is 25 points of

1741
02:09:44,372 --> 02:09:55,517
piercing damage. I'm not going to double that,
because technically it's not the attack, it's the

1742
02:09:55,517 --> 02:09:59,708
poison that hurt you. The poison isn't critical.
That's a gift.

1743
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:04,345
LIAM: It's pronounced "jift."

1744
02:10:04,345 --> 02:10:12,380
MATT: Now it's going to swing with its tail
action. That is a 20 to hit.

1745
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:15,695
SAM: I'm going to Cutting Words that, with my
reaction.

1746
02:10:15,695 --> 02:10:20,413
ASHLEY: My armor class is 20. Unless, there were
no aids with that--?

1747
02:10:20,413 --> 02:10:22,795
MATT: Well, hold on. You're going to Cutting
Words?

1748
02:10:22,795 --> 02:10:30,405
SAM: That's a hit? So I'm going to Cutting Words
that. I'm going to sing, (singing) Your evilness

1749
02:10:30,405 --> 02:10:41,585
is killing me, and I must confess, I want to flee!
But when you see me you lose your mind, baby it's

1750
02:10:41,585 --> 02:10:46,868
a sign! Pit fiend, baby, now you're mine!

1751
02:10:46,868 --> 02:10:50,023
LIAM: That was strong!

1752
02:10:50,023 --> 02:10:54,232
MATT: Roll that d12, man! You earned that shit!

1753
02:10:54,232 --> 02:10:57,586
SAM: Three.

1754
02:10:57,586 --> 02:11:03,320
MATT: That's enough! So, the tail sweeps over to
try and smash Pike. As you start singing, the

1755
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:10,779
tail, halfway through, stops, and it looks at you.
Then continues the swing, but that's just enough

1756
02:11:10,779 --> 02:11:14,499
for Pike to dodge out of the way, as it cracks
into the stonework. However, it then backswings

1757
02:11:14,499 --> 02:11:24,887
with its mace toward you with its final attack,
Pike. That is a 22 to hit. So you suffer 15 points

1758
02:11:24,887 --> 02:11:29,495
of bludgeoning damage, plus--

1759
02:11:29,495 --> 02:11:32,194
ASHLEY: I'm unconscious, I'm unconscious.

1760
02:11:32,194 --> 02:11:38,528
MATT: You're unconscious? Well, that would have
been an additional 24 points of fire damage. So

1761
02:11:38,528 --> 02:11:52,640
Pike is poisoned and unconscious. Scanlan, you
feel the blade at your side begin to vibrate at

1762
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:57,599
the end of your song. The Mythcarver that's been
sitting there, it begins to shake and quiver at

1763
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:07,755
your side. The erinyes is against you now, it's
its turn. Throws the bow to the side, on the

1764
02:12:07,755 --> 02:12:11,599
ground. Pulls its longsword out and is going to
go three attacks against you, having jammed your

1765
02:12:11,599 --> 02:12:12,902
blade into its side.

1766
02:12:12,902 --> 02:12:14,513
LIAM: Yes, Uncanny Dodge.

1767
02:12:14,513 --> 02:12:17,426
MATT: First one is going to be a 19?

1768
02:12:17,426 --> 02:12:19,665
LIAM: Does not hit.

1769
02:12:19,665 --> 02:12:25,077
MATT: That is a 13. Last hit is a 24.

1770
02:12:25,077 --> 02:12:29,620
LIAM: I will use a second luck to make her roll
again.

1771
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:33,115
MATT: That is even better. That is a 25.

1772
02:12:33,115 --> 02:12:35,126
LIAM: All right, Uncanny Dodge.

1773
02:12:35,126 --> 02:12:42,199
MATT: So you take the hit for the longsword.
That is five plus four, it's nine points of

1774
02:12:42,199 --> 02:12:53,221
slashing damage. Actually, sorry, that would be
plus more-- Nine points of slashing damage, plus

1775
02:12:53,221 --> 02:12:58,763
you take 20 points of poison damage.

1776
02:12:58,763 --> 02:13:02,085
LIAM: So the poison's full, but the swipe is
halved?

1777
02:13:02,085 --> 02:13:04,987
MATT: Technically, it's all in one strike, so the
whole attack would be halved.

1778
02:13:04,987 --> 02:13:07,545
LIAM: So it was nine plus what? 20?

1779
02:13:07,545 --> 02:13:16,239
MATT: Nine plus 20. You take 14 points of damage.
There you go. All right, Scanlan, it's your turn.

1780
02:13:16,239 --> 02:13:31,057
SAM: Fuck. I'm going to draw Mythcarver and look
at it. Admire it for a moment. Turn to Pike, who's

1781
02:13:31,057 --> 02:13:35,935
right next to me, and Healing Words her with just
a simple touch. Can I demonstrate on you,

1782
02:13:35,935 --> 02:13:41,181
Taliesin? I'm going to do this. Just that.

1783
02:13:41,181 --> 02:13:46,061
TALIESIN: It was actually rather pleasant, I have
to admit it. You have very soft hands.

1784
02:13:46,061 --> 02:13:55,815
SAM: They've never worked a day in their life. Ten
points of healing to Pikey.

1785
02:13:55,815 --> 02:14:03,478
MATT: Okay, as you sing, Pike, you do not heal
anything. Pike remains unconscious, bleeding. The

1786
02:14:03,478 --> 02:14:05,010
healing does not make its way through.

1787
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:06,700
LAURA: She's poisoned!

1788
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:09,934
ASHLEY: Oh god, sorry, that was so wasteful.

1789
02:14:09,934 --> 02:14:15,929
MATT: But anyway, what are you doing? You don't
notice this. You sing to her, finish your verse,

1790
02:14:15,929 --> 02:14:17,794
what are you doing?

1791
02:14:17,794 --> 02:14:27,803
SAM: But that changes things! Fuck, I stick to the
plan. Hand Cone up. I'm going to try and Dominate

1792
02:14:27,803 --> 02:14:31,149
what's-his-butt. The pit fiend.

1793
02:14:31,149 --> 02:14:37,201
MATT: All righty. Dominate Monster?

1794
02:14:37,201 --> 02:14:47,119
SAM: Yes. It's at disadvantage, so it's a straight
roll, but I know it's going to be pretty tough.

1795
02:14:47,119 --> 02:14:49,399
It's a wisdom save.

1796
02:14:49,399 --> 02:14:59,206
MATT: Wisdom saving throw. So that would be 23. 13
plus ten, he would've had disadvantage but he has

1797
02:14:59,206 --> 02:15:01,782
advantage against spell saves, so it comes to a
single roll.

1798
02:15:01,782 --> 02:15:03,478
SAM: Damn it, nothing's working.

1799
02:15:03,478 --> 02:15:09,404
MARISHA: He has advantage against spells! Magic
casters have been useless.

1800
02:15:09,404 --> 02:15:12,309
SAM: Pike is dead--

1801
02:15:12,309 --> 02:15:14,149
LAURA: Unconscious.

1802
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:15,890
SAM: Yeah, but I can't leave her.

1803
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:24,982
LAURA: But if you move her, you'll get an attack
of opportunity on her.

1804
02:15:24,982 --> 02:15:33,803
SAM: The thing is, I've made a promise to stay
alive. So I'm going to run away.

1805
02:15:33,803 --> 02:15:37,832
MATT: Okay, which way are you going?

1806
02:15:37,832 --> 02:15:39,325
SAM: Toward the mansion.

1807
02:15:39,325 --> 02:15:43,040
MATT: Okay, so as you move toward the mansion, you
go through to the lighted doorway. It gets an

1808
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:44,799
attack of opportunity on you, Scanlan.

1809
02:15:44,799 --> 02:15:45,813
SAM: Sure.

1810
02:15:45,813 --> 02:15:49,164
MATT: It's going to make its bite attack. That is
a 21 to hit.

1811
02:15:49,164 --> 02:15:50,405
SAM: Oh, sure.

1812
02:15:50,405 --> 02:16:01,546
MATT: All right. You suffer 20 points of piercing
damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

1813
02:16:01,546 --> 02:16:05,974
SAM: That's not good.

1814
02:16:05,974 --> 02:16:07,943
LAURA: God, that Heroes' Feast, man. That would've
been clutch.

1815
02:16:07,943 --> 02:16:09,238
MARISHA: That would have been so great.

1816
02:16:09,238 --> 02:16:10,246
SAM: 21.

1817
02:16:10,246 --> 02:16:17,293
MATT: 21. You just succeed in shrugging the poison
off, as it bites out at you and the teeth claw

1818
02:16:17,293 --> 02:16:21,080
against your shoulder as you run past, scooting
around the way to where the entrance to the

1819
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:26,358
mansion is. You're still feeling the blade
vibrating at your side. It's almost like a pulse,

1820
02:16:26,358 --> 02:16:33,161
like it's trying to fight to be free. So you rush
around. You get to this side.

1821
02:16:33,161 --> 02:16:36,739
SAM: I don't want to go in the mansion. I want to
stay outside. I'm going to go back to my barrel,

1822
02:16:36,739 --> 02:16:41,581
around where Taliesin was before. Hide back there.
Yeah.

1823
02:16:41,581 --> 02:16:47,151
MATT: Okay, there you go. That ends your turn,
Scanlan? Pike, I need you to make a death saving throw.

1824
02:16:47,151 --> 02:16:56,595
ASHLEY: Okay, well, let's see. 1d8 plus one?

1825
02:16:56,595 --> 02:16:58,749
LAURA: No, just roll a d20.

1826
02:16:58,749 --> 02:17:01,399
ASHLEY: I don't know what to do. I don't think
I've done this before.

1827
02:17:01,399 --> 02:17:03,104
LIAM: Ten or higher.

1828
02:17:03,104 --> 02:17:05,732
ASHLEY: That was a five.

1829
02:17:05,732 --> 02:17:12,548
MATT: Okay, so that's a failure. You also take a
pulse of the poison damage in your body, so you

1830
02:17:12,548 --> 02:17:14,501
fail another death saving throw.

1831
02:17:14,501 --> 02:17:16,045
TALIESIN: Fix right now.

1832
02:17:16,045 --> 02:17:17,661
LAURA: We've got to heal her!

1833
02:17:17,661 --> 02:17:26,953
MARISHA: Who's close to her? Do you still have any
spells left? The poison spell?

1834
02:17:26,953 --> 02:17:28,448
LAURA: I do, I have the poison spell--

1835
02:17:28,448 --> 02:17:29,737
SAM: You're in the mansion.

1836
02:17:29,737 --> 02:17:31,314
LAURA: Okay, I'm first out. So, yeah, but I can
run out.

1837
02:17:31,314 --> 02:17:32,713
MARISHA: Can you drag her in?

1838
02:17:32,713 --> 02:17:36,129
LAURA: No, he can't move her! He'll get an attack
of opportunity on Pike!

1839
02:17:36,129 --> 02:17:37,991
TALIESIN: No, he's already burned his attack of
opportunity.

1840
02:17:37,991 --> 02:17:39,802
MARISHA: Yeah, trying to get Scanlan.

1841
02:17:39,802 --> 02:17:50,556
MATT: The efreeti, now, watching you now attack
and go after this fiend, pulls its blade out and

1842
02:17:50,556 --> 02:17:52,377
rushes toward you, Scanlan.

1843
02:17:52,377 --> 02:17:54,470
LAURA: Guess those jewels didn't do shit.

1844
02:17:54,470 --> 02:18:00,971
LIAM: You can keep the jewels, though. Stanky
jewels.

1845
02:18:00,971 --> 02:18:06,579
MATT: He's heading toward you. "Halt! In the name
of the Sultan!" Takes its blade out, and it's

1846
02:18:06,579 --> 02:18:08,874
going to make two scimitar attacks against you,
Scanlan.

1847
02:18:08,874 --> 02:18:15,340
SAM: I do this and say, you wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1848
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:20,223
TALIESIN: Oh, yes they would.

1849
02:18:20,223 --> 02:18:22,462
MATT: Actually, he's not going to move toward you.
He's going to stay back there, on top of the

1850
02:18:22,462 --> 02:18:27,509
bridge, and he's going to hurl two balls of flame
at you.

1851
02:18:27,509 --> 02:18:29,749
SAM: Why, why!

1852
02:18:29,749 --> 02:18:32,837
MATT: That is going to be a 21 to hit.

1853
02:18:32,837 --> 02:18:33,999
SAM: I mean, yeah.

1854
02:18:33,999 --> 02:18:36,652
MATT: And a ten to hit.

1855
02:18:36,652 --> 02:18:38,040
SAM: No!

1856
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:41,438
MATT: So the second one misses you and blasts in
the ground next to you, but the first one does--

1857
02:18:41,438 --> 02:18:43,661
TALIESIN: Something missed! It's so nice.

1858
02:18:43,661 --> 02:18:49,417
MATT: That is 13 points of fire damage to you,
Scanlan, as the fireball blasts against your chest.

1859
02:18:49,417 --> 02:18:53,304
SAM: Matches my beard, now.

1860
02:18:53,304 --> 02:18:56,571
MARISHA: Yeah, it just made you look real cool.

1861
02:18:56,571 --> 02:19:00,328
MATT: All righty, that brings us to the top. Vex.

1862
02:19:00,328 --> 02:19:06,041
LAURA: I mean, the thing is-- I'll come out,
obviously. I'm going to come out of the mansion.

1863
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:12,103
And I'll immediately see Pike.

1864
02:19:12,103 --> 02:19:14,206
MATT: You see Pike, unconscious, on the ground.

1865
02:19:14,206 --> 02:19:19,723
LAURA: I mean, she's right under the demon.

1866
02:19:19,723 --> 02:19:23,217
ASHLEY: Don't, it's dangerous!

1867
02:19:23,217 --> 02:19:25,604
MARISHA: You will die!

1868
02:19:25,604 --> 02:19:38,675
TALIESIN: As far as I know, its reaction, its
single reaction--

1869
02:19:38,675 --> 02:19:48,887
LAURA: I'm going to-- it's not going to work. I'm
going to try to distract him with Trinket, so I'm

1870
02:19:48,887 --> 02:19:53,539
going to have Trinket attack him as I run in and
cast Protection from Poison on Pike.

1871
02:19:53,539 --> 02:20:00,129
MATT: Okay. As you rush forward to cast your
spell, I will say, make an intelligence check.

1872
02:20:00,129 --> 02:20:05,780
LAURA: Oh, because yeah, fuck. I was in the
mansion. What's going on? Can I say that?

1873
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:12,106
TALIESIN: We've probably, I imagine, been
narrating an awful lot of what's going on through

1874
02:20:12,106 --> 02:20:14,451
the headpiece. Well, maybe not.

1875
02:20:14,451 --> 02:20:16,557
SAM: Those don't reach into the mansion.

1876
02:20:16,557 --> 02:20:18,164
LAURA: I can just see that Pike's unconscious.

1877
02:20:18,164 --> 02:20:19,977
MATT: You see that Pike's unconscious. What'd you
roll?

1878
02:20:19,977 --> 02:20:22,934
LAURA: I rolled a, oh, just intelligence? Five.

1879
02:20:22,934 --> 02:20:28,598
MATT: So yeah, you have no idea that she's
poisoned. You just see her unconscious on the ground.

1880
02:20:28,598 --> 02:20:33,968
LAURA: So I can't even cast that on her.

1881
02:20:33,968 --> 02:20:36,165
MATT: I mean, you wouldn't know to.

1882
02:20:36,165 --> 02:20:41,065
TALIESIN: I was going to say, she was yelling--
Well, fuck.

1883
02:20:41,065 --> 02:20:48,240
MATT: She wouldn't have heard you, she was in the
mansion. Downside of using it as a defense

1884
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:49,476
mechanism.

1885
02:20:49,476 --> 02:20:50,791
LAURA: Right.

1886
02:20:50,791 --> 02:20:54,160
MATT: You're up next, Keyleth.

1887
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:57,593
LAURA: Does Lesser Restoration heal at all?

1888
02:20:57,593 --> 02:20:59,698
MATT: No.

1889
02:20:59,698 --> 02:21:07,096
MARISHA: It doesn't heal, but it should fix
poison.

1890
02:21:07,096 --> 02:21:09,428
MATT: If she knew there was poison.

1891
02:21:09,428 --> 02:21:14,624
LAURA: I don't know that she's poisoned. All
right, then I'm going to waste my turn completely

1892
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:18,326
and try to cast Cure Wounds on her, because that's
all I fucking--

1893
02:21:18,326 --> 02:21:22,267
MATT: As you rush forward, Trinket distracting,
are you using your bonus action to have Trinket

1894
02:21:22,267 --> 02:21:26,762
attack? So go ahead and roll the attack with
Trinket. You rush forward and put your hands onto

1895
02:21:26,762 --> 02:21:31,563
Pike, desperately trying to heal her. As the
energy pulses through her body, no effect. All you

1896
02:21:31,563 --> 02:21:40,495
see is the wound from the bite of the fiend in her
neck, and you see the dark veins curling up. Now

1897
02:21:40,495 --> 02:21:42,875
you know, at that proximity, that it's poison.

1898
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:46,371
LAURA: I couldn't have run up and looked at her,
to know it was poison? To see the black around her

1899
02:21:46,371 --> 02:22:02,142
fucking--? Cool. 27 for the attack on Trinket, and
then that is a 14, no, that's a lie. 11.

1900
02:22:02,142 --> 02:22:07,812
MATT: All right. Good to know.

1901
02:22:07,812 --> 02:22:10,838
LAURA: If I move, I'll get attacked.

1902
02:22:10,838 --> 02:22:12,232
MATT: Yes, you will.

1903
02:22:12,232 --> 02:22:14,103
LAURA: I'm going to die.

1904
02:22:14,103 --> 02:22:15,475
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

1905
02:22:15,475 --> 02:22:18,578
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to Sunbeam She-Ra
right in the face.

1906
02:22:18,578 --> 02:22:26,274
TRAVIS: I love that that's her unofficial name.
Announce yourself, woman! Thing! Whatever!

1907
02:22:26,274 --> 02:22:35,631
MARISHA: Just say, I'm sorry, what's your name?

1908
02:22:35,631 --> 02:22:37,987
MATT: From this perspective, you will hit him with
your Sunbeam.

1909
02:22:37,987 --> 02:22:40,386
MARISHA: Well, I can fly, so can I scooch around?

1910
02:22:40,386 --> 02:22:44,651
MATT: You can move around this direction, try and
do it there. So burst that way. Just wanted to

1911
02:22:44,651 --> 02:22:51,765
make sure you're aware of-- All right. Rolled two
threes in a row. Does not save.

1912
02:22:51,765 --> 02:23:01,703
MARISHA: That's right! For once! All right. So,
she's blind, that's the cool part. That's a good

1913
02:23:01,703 --> 02:23:19,447
roll! Okay, that's 14 plus seven, which is 21.
(adding) 29. No, no! 27 plus four is 21.

1914
02:23:19,447 --> 02:23:23,542
MATT: Okay, so as you dart around the side of the
erinyes, you see her bloodied--

1915
02:23:23,542 --> 02:23:25,382
MARISHA: 31.

1916
02:23:25,382 --> 02:23:33,147
MATT: --begins hacking at Vax, right next to you.
You rush around, your hands glow. This beam of sun

1917
02:23:33,147 --> 02:23:38,279
energy bursts out. You hear the screaming echo as
her body is turned to ash within her armor,

1918
02:23:38,279 --> 02:23:42,930
causing the armor to clank to the ground, the rope
at her side scattering to the ground as well. She

1919
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:45,039
has been destroyed.

1920
02:23:45,039 --> 02:23:49,604
MARISHA: Something. It's a hollow victory.

1921
02:23:49,604 --> 02:23:51,468
LAURA: Good job, good job.

1922
02:23:51,468 --> 02:23:53,265
MARISHA: Do I still have any more movement?

1923
02:23:53,265 --> 02:23:58,451
MATT: You do. You've moved five feet, so you still
have--

1924
02:23:58,451 --> 02:24:00,458
MARISHA: 85 flying speed.

1925
02:24:00,458 --> 02:24:04,564
LIAM: I got Pike.

1926
02:24:04,564 --> 02:24:14,781
MARISHA: You've got Pike. I want to, can I make it
to Big Pharma? I don't remember any of their

1927
02:24:14,781 --> 02:24:18,389
names. I'm just using the nicknames we've come up
with. Ghurrix.

1928
02:24:18,389 --> 02:24:27,521
MATT: Yeah, you can get up next to him, if you
want to. You want to get up next to him? There?

1929
02:24:27,521 --> 02:24:30,269
MARISHA: Yeah, can I flank him a bit?

1930
02:24:30,269 --> 02:24:33,473
MATT: You could fly over and flank him this way,
if you wanted.

1931
02:24:33,473 --> 02:24:35,132
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to flank.

1932
02:24:35,132 --> 02:24:37,008
SAM: Got to flank.

1933
02:24:37,008 --> 02:24:42,185
MATT: Kind of hard to flank without stepping into
the mansion, unfortunately, because the door is

1934
02:24:42,185 --> 02:24:43,358
right there on the flank.

1935
02:24:43,358 --> 02:24:45,641
MARISHA: I can fly, though. I can hover. Can I
hover and flank?

1936
02:24:45,641 --> 02:24:49,309
MATT: Not really. You have to be on the entire
opposite side from somebody else. So there's no

1937
02:24:49,309 --> 02:24:53,747
real place you can flank here, unfortunately.

1938
02:24:53,747 --> 02:25:00,334
SAM: It's all good. You're going to die anyway. It
doesn't matter, right? We're all going to die.

1939
02:25:00,334 --> 02:25:07,463
MARISHA: I'll just hover there and look imposing.
I'll puff up real big.

1940
02:25:07,463 --> 02:25:16,615
MATT: Good to know. So you are puffing up real
big. We'll say above. All right, cool. Grog.

1941
02:25:16,615 --> 02:25:23,519
TRAVIS: Right, not that I don't love being in this
river of liquid magma, could I get out, please?

1942
02:25:23,519 --> 02:25:29,070
MATT: Well, first you take 74 points of fire
damage from being in the lava at the start of your turn.

1943
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:30,636
TRAVIS: Can I use Stone's Endurance?

1944
02:25:30,636 --> 02:25:32,646
MATT: You can.

1945
02:25:32,646 --> 02:25:43,554
TRAVIS: 26. So what's--

1946
02:25:43,554 --> 02:25:46,415
MATT: It'd be 48. You take 48 points of fire
damage.

1947
02:25:46,415 --> 02:25:48,595
TRAVIS: Thank you for doing the math for me.

1948
02:25:48,595 --> 02:25:54,780
MATT: The pain is unbearable, but you use that to
fuel your anger as you climb out, feeling the

1949
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:58,210
molten rock spilling off of your body. I imagine
you're going to want to move out of it.

1950
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:04,165
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Toward everybody else, where
all the danger is. The fun zone. Now, I have a

1951
02:26:04,165 --> 02:26:05,099
question.

1952
02:26:05,099 --> 02:26:07,794
MATT: You want to flank around this way, or this
way?

1953
02:26:07,794 --> 02:26:09,231
TRAVIS: Around this way.

1954
02:26:09,231 --> 02:26:11,477
MATT: Okay, so you pull around to that side.

1955
02:26:11,477 --> 02:26:17,824
TRAVIS: What I would like to try and do is, as I
get out of the magma, seeing Pike unconscious is

1956
02:26:17,824 --> 02:26:26,913
the worst. If I try and grab her, and head for the
door, I have to go past the pit fiend. He'll get

1957
02:26:26,913 --> 02:26:33,110
an attack of opportunity on me. If I'm cradling
her, does he get one on her as well?

1958
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:38,515
MATT: Generally, attack of opportunity is against
the creature that's running, so it'd probably be

1959
02:26:38,515 --> 02:26:40,337
against you.

1960
02:26:40,337 --> 02:26:46,308
TRAVIS: All right, I would like to pick up my
buddy Pike and make like hell for the door.

1961
02:26:46,308 --> 02:26:51,997
MATT: Okay, so you reach down. You grab her using
your full action, pick her currently unconscious,

1962
02:26:51,997 --> 02:26:59,190
limp form in your arm, cradling her. You see the
wound, the blood, across her. You pick her up and

1963
02:26:59,190 --> 02:27:04,581
you go running around, into the door. As you do,
the pit fiend-- He already took his attack of

1964
02:27:04,581 --> 02:27:10,469
opportunity earlier, so yeah, he does not get one.
So you grab Pike, and move, and disappear into the

1965
02:27:10,469 --> 02:27:12,375
doorway with her.

1966
02:27:12,375 --> 02:27:15,143
TRAVIS: All right. Oh, Pike!

1967
02:27:15,143 --> 02:27:19,274
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn, Grog. Vax,
you're up.

1968
02:27:19,274 --> 02:27:29,696
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to rocket toward the, hm.
Just give me ten seconds to think.

1969
02:27:29,696 --> 02:27:33,924
SAM: Loot Crate, Loot Crate.

1970
02:27:33,924 --> 02:27:36,270
MATT: Be ready, Percy.

1971
02:27:36,270 --> 02:27:42,017
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to rocket into the door, so
I've got haste, I've got 120 feet.

1972
02:27:42,017 --> 02:27:44,036
MATT: Okay.

1973
02:27:44,036 --> 02:27:49,361
LIAM: So I'm going to arc into the door. If I pass
the pit demon, I'm going to use disengage as a

1974
02:27:49,361 --> 02:27:52,236
bonus action so he does not, and I'll swivel
underneath.

1975
02:27:52,236 --> 02:27:54,059
LAURA: He's already used his attack of
opportunity.

1976
02:27:54,059 --> 02:27:58,945
LIAM: He has? Oh, and Vex is right next to him?
Five feet? I'm going to stab him in the fucking

1977
02:27:58,945 --> 02:28:07,252
face as I fly in the door. 24, hits.

1978
02:28:07,252 --> 02:28:08,876
MATT: 24 hits, yep.

1979
02:28:08,876 --> 02:28:35,324
LIAM: Okay, so that is (adding) 41, as I fly past
into the door. Use Lay on Hands twice. There's

1980
02:28:35,324 --> 02:28:38,847
nothing in the book that says I can only use it
once a turn. So I'm going to use the first time I

1981
02:28:38,847 --> 02:28:46,329
use it to cast Neutralize Poison on her, and the
second time I'm going to use it to give her one

1982
02:28:46,329 --> 02:28:51,752
hit point. It doesn't say anything in the book
about amount per turn.

1983
02:28:51,752 --> 02:28:54,249
MATT: As an action, you touch a creature.

1984
02:28:54,249 --> 02:28:56,314
LIAM: But I have two more actions.

1985
02:28:56,314 --> 02:28:58,136
MATT: You used one to attack.

1986
02:28:58,136 --> 02:28:59,819
LIAM: Can I use the bonus action to attack?

1987
02:28:59,819 --> 02:29:05,233
MATT: You could use your haste attack to hit him
on the way through, and that can only be used as

1988
02:29:05,233 --> 02:29:10,012
an attack anyway, because that's the nature of the
haste bonus. You can use your action to neutralize

1989
02:29:10,012 --> 02:29:11,278
the poison.

1990
02:29:11,278 --> 02:29:17,276
LIAM: All right, question for Matt, and I'm Liam
right now. If I bring her up ten hit points,

1991
02:29:17,276 --> 02:29:22,520
right, poison doesn't bring her down anymore in
5e, it just puts her to disadvantage, correct?

1992
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:27,907
MATT: This poison, you're not quite sure. You
don't know the circumstance.

1993
02:29:27,907 --> 02:29:32,388
LIAM: I'm going to use five points of Lay on Hands
to cure the poison.

1994
02:29:32,388 --> 02:29:36,740
MATT: Okay, so the poison is removed from her.
That is as much as you can do.

1995
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:40,971
LIAM: Well, if I can only use Lay on Hands once,
I'm going to throw another dagger out the door

1996
02:29:40,971 --> 02:29:42,605
into the pit fiend--

1997
02:29:42,605 --> 02:29:46,243
MATT: You cannot see him from that side of the
door. The doorway is facing outward. He's on the

1998
02:29:46,243 --> 02:29:52,138
other side of the doorway. That is the end of your
turn. Pike is no longer poisoned. The bulging

1999
02:29:52,138 --> 02:29:58,014
black veins retract from her throat. The shallow
breath is still there, though fading. Percy.

2000
02:29:58,014 --> 02:30:04,508
TALIESIN: I've lost my list of healing potions,
but I think I had a minor potion left.

2001
02:30:04,508 --> 02:30:07,084
MARISHA: Are you inside?

2002
02:30:07,084 --> 02:30:08,378
TALIESIN: I am inside.

2003
02:30:08,378 --> 02:30:10,167
TRAVIS: I got lots of potions.

2004
02:30:10,167 --> 02:30:13,269
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab a potion from-- I was
about to say, I know I have one, but everything

2005
02:30:13,269 --> 02:30:18,227
got fucked. We restocked right before we went. I'm
going to feed her a potion for my move.

2006
02:30:18,227 --> 02:30:24,660
MATT: Well, for your bonus. Well no, it would be
your action to feed her a potion. All right, so,

2007
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:26,510
feeding her just a basic?

2008
02:30:26,510 --> 02:30:27,797
TALIESIN: Feeding her a basic.

2009
02:30:27,797 --> 02:30:32,969
MATT: All righty. That is a 2d4 plus two.

2010
02:30:32,969 --> 02:30:37,654
TALIESIN: All right. Do I still have movement?
Okay.

2011
02:30:37,654 --> 02:30:40,526
MARISHA: Holy shit.

2012
02:30:40,526 --> 02:30:45,166
TALIESIN: That's five.

2013
02:30:45,166 --> 02:30:48,154
ASHLEY: I'll take it!

2014
02:30:48,154 --> 02:30:50,184
MATT: Pike is now at five hit points and
conscious.

2015
02:30:50,184 --> 02:30:51,898
TRAVIS: Pikey!

2016
02:30:51,898 --> 02:30:55,225
MARISHA: Good teamwork, good teamwork!

2017
02:30:55,225 --> 02:31:00,610
TRAVIS: (voice cracking) Don't do that to us,
Pike!

2018
02:31:00,610 --> 02:31:04,019
MATT: Percy, that end your turn?

2019
02:31:04,019 --> 02:31:07,873
TALIESIN: No. Weird question, how far away is Vex
from the door?

2020
02:31:07,873 --> 02:31:13,465
MATT: Vex is roughly 15 feet.

2021
02:31:13,465 --> 02:31:22,072
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to use half my movement
to get to Vex. If this can be done, I'm going to

2022
02:31:22,072 --> 02:31:34,768
burn my action surge and grab her. The rest of my
movement to drag her into the hole. 15 more feet.

2023
02:31:34,768 --> 02:31:36,007
15 and 15.

2024
02:31:36,007 --> 02:31:38,179
MATT: 15 feet will get you inside, and get her
just outside the door.

2025
02:31:38,179 --> 02:31:40,376
TALIESIN: That'll do.

2026
02:31:40,376 --> 02:31:43,077
MARISHA: Pike? I thought she was already inside?

2027
02:31:43,077 --> 02:31:45,512
LAURA: No, that was me he was doing that to.

2028
02:31:45,512 --> 02:31:47,041
SAM: Are you unconscious, too?

2029
02:31:47,041 --> 02:31:50,388
TALIESIN: No, she's in striking distance of the
asshole. I'm getting her out of striking distance

2030
02:31:50,388 --> 02:31:55,566
of the asshole. Okay! That's my move.

2031
02:31:55,566 --> 02:32:01,787
MATT: That's your move. All righty. Now it is
Ghurrix's turn. Ghurrix, who watched his summoned

2032
02:32:01,787 --> 02:32:09,036
ally get thrown back to the Hells through the
Sunbeam that blasted over the side, looks over to

2033
02:32:09,036 --> 02:32:16,428
the efreet that appears to be, now, on his side.
Takes a leap up (whooshing, crashing) in between

2034
02:32:16,428 --> 02:32:21,934
Scanlan and Vex. Let's see.

2035
02:32:21,934 --> 02:32:23,978
LIAM: Look at his eyes.

2036
02:32:23,978 --> 02:32:25,172
MARISHA: I know.

2037
02:32:25,172 --> 02:32:27,136
MATT: He's real angry at both of you.

2038
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:32,553
SAM: I haven't done <i>anything</i> to him, by the way.
Not a <i>thing</i>.

2039
02:32:32,553 --> 02:32:34,491
MATT: You've tried twice to put him in a magic
sphere--

2040
02:32:34,491 --> 02:32:37,206
SAM: Three times! But I've done nothing!

2041
02:32:37,206 --> 02:32:43,409
MATT: As an intelligent creature that is very,
very familiar with high-level mind controlling--

2042
02:32:43,409 --> 02:32:45,737
SAM: All I've done is perform for him, really.

2043
02:32:45,737 --> 02:32:56,200
MATT: This is true. Regardless, he's going to take
a claw and a bite attack at you, Vex, and then

2044
02:32:56,200 --> 02:32:59,825
make a mace and tail against you, Scanlan.

2045
02:32:59,825 --> 02:33:04,244
SAM: I'm going to Cutting Words the mace attack.
Right?

2046
02:33:04,244 --> 02:33:15,637
MATT: Well, wait till we get to it. So the claw
against you is 34, with a 19 on that. You take 18

2047
02:33:15,637 --> 02:33:19,967
points of slashing damage from the claw. The bite
attack--

2048
02:33:19,967 --> 02:33:21,203
LIAM: She's unconscious already!

2049
02:33:21,203 --> 02:33:22,561
LAURA: No, I'm not!

2050
02:33:22,561 --> 02:33:23,744
LIAM: You're about to be!

2051
02:33:23,744 --> 02:33:25,011
MATT: That is a 25 to hit.

2052
02:33:25,011 --> 02:33:26,253
LAURA: Okay.

2053
02:33:26,253 --> 02:33:33,710
MATT: All right, you suffer (adding) 21 points of
piercing damage.

2054
02:33:33,710 --> 02:33:37,181
LAURA: Motherfuck, I'm unconscious again. By one
point!

2055
02:33:37,181 --> 02:33:38,909
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

2056
02:33:38,909 --> 02:33:45,791
LAURA: For the poison? I've got resistance to
poison now, because I cast Protection from Poison

2057
02:33:45,791 --> 02:33:46,776
on myself.

2058
02:33:46,776 --> 02:33:48,328
MATT: Well, you're unconscious. The spell goes
away.

2059
02:33:48,328 --> 02:33:49,837
LAURA: Aw, that's bullshit!

2060
02:33:49,837 --> 02:33:51,014
MATT: Sorry.

2061
02:33:51,014 --> 02:33:52,174
LAURA: God damn it.

2062
02:33:52,174 --> 02:33:54,204
TALIESIN: Even though she was conscious when she
got bitten?

2063
02:33:54,204 --> 02:33:58,839
MATT: The poison damage isn't what knocked her
unconscious. The bite hits, she falls unconscious,

2064
02:33:58,839 --> 02:34:00,774
and the poison goes through her body.

2065
02:34:00,774 --> 02:34:03,703
LAURA: It's an eight because it's a saving throw.

2066
02:34:03,703 --> 02:34:09,212
MATT: Okay, you fail a death saving throw as the
poison courses through your body. You are now

2067
02:34:09,212 --> 02:34:12,543
poisoned and unconscious, right outside the
mansion door.

2068
02:34:12,543 --> 02:34:16,615
LAURA: Great. Tight.

2069
02:34:16,615 --> 02:34:18,488
MATT: Now, for you, Scanlan.

2070
02:34:18,488 --> 02:34:20,155
SAM: Yeah, what?

2071
02:34:20,155 --> 02:34:23,075
MATT: The tail attack is a 20 to hit you.

2072
02:34:23,075 --> 02:34:24,658
TALIESIN: At least we all see that.

2073
02:34:24,658 --> 02:34:29,814
LAURA: Oh yeah, you just watched that happen right
in front of the door.

2074
02:34:29,814 --> 02:34:33,041
TALIESIN: So we now know what to do.

2075
02:34:33,041 --> 02:34:37,149
LIAM: I'm holding my dying friend, next to my
dying sister.

2076
02:34:37,149 --> 02:34:40,136
MATT: 33 points of bludgeoning damage.

2077
02:34:40,136 --> 02:34:42,787
SAM: Yep.

2078
02:34:42,787 --> 02:34:46,278
MATT: As the tail spins and slams you to the side,
you get pushed against the wall in the corner

2079
02:34:46,278 --> 02:34:52,584
where you've been hiding. The mace is going to
swing toward you. That is going to be a 25.

2080
02:34:52,584 --> 02:34:59,407
SAM: Jesus, well, I'm Cutting Words-ing it, but
it's not going to do much unless I roll a lot. I'm

2081
02:34:59,407 --> 02:35:03,112
going to Cutting Words him with a lovely
limerick.

2082
02:35:03,112 --> 02:35:06,943
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck. All right.

2083
02:35:06,943 --> 02:35:12,200
SAM: There was a young fellow named Brewster, who
said to his wife as he goosed her, "It used to be

2084
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:17,699
"grand, but just look at my hand. You ain't wiping
as clean as you used to."

2085
02:35:17,699 --> 02:35:22,630
(sounds of dismay)

2086
02:35:22,630 --> 02:35:24,683
LAURA: What did you give him, Taliesin?

2087
02:35:24,683 --> 02:35:26,837
TALIESIN: The only thing I could think of.

2088
02:35:26,837 --> 02:35:29,562
MARISHA: What horror have you brought upon us?!

2089
02:35:29,562 --> 02:35:36,340
MATT: Even an ambassador to the Nine Hells is
taken aback by the sheer filthiness of this

2090
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:38,895
limerick. Go ahead and roll your d12.

2091
02:35:38,895 --> 02:35:42,299
SAM: It's bad. It's two.

2092
02:35:42,299 --> 02:35:46,111
MATT: The mace hits you from the side.

2093
02:35:46,111 --> 02:35:49,128
TRAVIS: Just for the sheer limerick.

2094
02:35:49,128 --> 02:35:54,411
MATT: That is 11 points of bludgeoning damage.

2095
02:35:54,411 --> 02:36:04,590
MARISHA: Yeah, we're starting to-- not like this.
Starting to drop like flies.

2096
02:36:04,590 --> 02:36:08,721
MATT: Plus 16 points of fire damage. Still
standing, Scanlan?

2097
02:36:08,721 --> 02:36:09,877
SAM: Oh yeah.

2098
02:36:09,877 --> 02:36:16,254
MATT: Nice. All right. That's going to end the pit
fiend's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

2099
02:36:16,254 --> 02:36:20,611
SAM: Nothing has worked on this motherfucker.
Nothing!

2100
02:36:20,611 --> 02:36:22,235
LIAM: What about your sword?

2101
02:36:22,235 --> 02:36:25,436
LAURA: Do the sword! Yes, attack him as you run by
him.

2102
02:36:25,436 --> 02:36:29,158
SAM: I still draw Mythcarver, and then I put it
away.

2103
02:36:29,158 --> 02:36:30,788
LAURA: No, come on, attack him.

2104
02:36:30,788 --> 02:36:32,042
SAM: I don't hit things with swords.

2105
02:36:32,042 --> 02:36:33,881
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's vibrating.

2106
02:36:33,881 --> 02:36:38,776
SAM: If I did something with everything that
vibrated on my body, I would be doing stuff all

2107
02:36:38,776 --> 02:36:40,429
day long, right.

2108
02:36:40,429 --> 02:36:41,951
MATT: Do you pull the blade from the scabbard?

2109
02:36:41,951 --> 02:36:44,407
SAM: I did in the last turn. It's still out.

2110
02:36:44,407 --> 02:36:50,943
MATT: Right, the second time, as you pull the
blade out, you can see it's glowing, and it's like

2111
02:36:50,943 --> 02:37:00,101
a tuning fork. It's vibrating at the tip, and the
sword is wanting to guide you. It's your call.

2112
02:37:00,101 --> 02:37:02,930
MARISHA: I feel like this is a very strong hint
from the Dungeon Master.

2113
02:37:02,930 --> 02:37:06,558
SAM: I'm not picking up any signs from him.

2114
02:37:06,558 --> 02:37:11,686
TRAVIS: I think you should just put it away. Maybe
offer him the Mythcarver to leave us alone.

2115
02:37:11,686 --> 02:37:15,785
MATT: What do you want to do, Scanlan? Your choice
entirely.

2116
02:37:15,785 --> 02:37:22,771
SAM: I'm going to bonus action heal myself,
Healing Word level two. Okay, two of these. So

2117
02:37:22,771 --> 02:37:26,384
that's nine points.

2118
02:37:26,384 --> 02:37:29,472
MATT: You get nine points, all right. You heal
nine points.

2119
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:36,793
SAM: Great, and then I'm going to let the sword
guide me. I'm going to position it around my belt

2120
02:37:36,793 --> 02:37:43,827
and thrust forward at the beast. I don't know what
to do now.

2121
02:37:43,827 --> 02:37:45,615
LIAM: Roll a d20 to start.

2122
02:37:45,615 --> 02:37:49,777
MATT: Okay, so you used your Cutting Words
feature, so your attack's at advantage, right?

2123
02:37:49,777 --> 02:37:51,113
SAM: Yes.

2124
02:37:51,113 --> 02:37:58,545
MATT: So, as you let the sword guide you, you feel
this energy, this warmth come from the blade, fill

2125
02:37:58,545 --> 02:38:05,048
your arms, and for a second you watch and feel the
spirit of a hundred bards that have wielded this

2126
02:38:05,048 --> 02:38:10,014
blade course through you. You see many, many foes
that have fallen to its blade and those that have

2127
02:38:10,014 --> 02:38:15,876
fallen clutching it at their side. And utilizing
that, you unleash a flurry. You actually get to

2128
02:38:15,876 --> 02:38:18,946
attack four times, all with advantage.

2129
02:38:18,946 --> 02:38:22,197
TRAVIS: With advantage!

2130
02:38:22,197 --> 02:38:26,383
MARISHA: You've had this by your side the whole
time?

2131
02:38:26,383 --> 02:38:28,896
SAM: Okay.

2132
02:38:28,896 --> 02:38:32,364
LIAM: Whatever it is, Matt's been sitting on it
for months. Months.

2133
02:38:32,364 --> 02:38:36,572
SAM: First one is 24. I think.

2134
02:38:36,572 --> 02:38:38,367
MATT: 24 hits.

2135
02:38:38,367 --> 02:38:39,667
MARISHA: That's real good.

2136
02:38:39,667 --> 02:38:44,892
SAM: The second one is more than that. I'm not
even going to do the math. Third one's even more

2137
02:38:44,892 --> 02:38:51,161
than that. I'm not going to do the math. The
fourth one is-- Well this is cocked, so I'm going

2138
02:38:51,161 --> 02:38:53,765
to redo that one. It was a ten plus nine, 19.

2139
02:38:53,765 --> 02:38:57,221
MATT: That last one misses, but the first three
hit. Go ahead and roll damage on those.

2140
02:38:57,221 --> 02:39:05,327
TALIESIN: Mythcarver is a 1d8 and a 1d6 plus
three.

2141
02:39:05,327 --> 02:39:27,753
SAM: Okay. So we're up to 16. Not very much. Ooh,
that's good. 29 total.

2142
02:39:27,753 --> 02:39:37,055
MATT: 29 total, okay. So as the energy courses
through your body, the blade in your hand.

2143
02:39:37,055 --> 02:39:38,772
How do you want to do this?

2144
02:39:38,772 --> 02:39:41,158
(cheering)

2145
02:39:41,158 --> 02:39:43,425
TRAVIS: On the pit fiend?

2146
02:39:43,425 --> 02:39:45,089
LAURA: Are you fucking kidding me?

2147
02:39:45,089 --> 02:39:46,616
SAM: I get to kill the pit fiend?

2148
02:39:46,616 --> 02:39:48,925
LAURA: And the only person that saw it was fucking
Keyleth.

2149
02:39:48,925 --> 02:39:50,595
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2150
02:39:50,595 --> 02:39:55,674
TALIESIN: Yeah, this doesn't feel fair.

2151
02:39:55,674 --> 02:39:57,434
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

2152
02:39:57,434 --> 02:40:02,052
MATT: He only had 22 hit points left.

2153
02:40:02,052 --> 02:40:11,987
SAM: As I slice, I want to slice one wing off,
then the other wing off, and then, as I stab him

2154
02:40:11,987 --> 02:40:19,831
straight through the heart, I will say: no one
messes up a deal with Francois Australia!

2155
02:40:19,831 --> 02:40:25,282
TRAVIS: I cannot believe it. I <i>cannot</i> believe
it.

2156
02:40:25,282 --> 02:40:27,862
LAURA: And all of us have been fucking running.

2157
02:40:27,862 --> 02:40:31,931
TRAVIS: Yeah, but the Vestige got used!

2158
02:40:31,931 --> 02:40:38,953
MATT: As one wing is cloven off from one side, in
a clean cut, it turns into ash and fire on one

2159
02:40:38,953 --> 02:40:44,139
side. The other wing darts off, hits the lava, and
turns to ash across the top of that. This time, as

2160
02:40:44,139 --> 02:40:50,143
it's snarling toward you, the voice in your head
saying, "I will find you!" the blade (stabbing)

2161
02:40:50,143 --> 02:40:56,072
right through its chest. (gasping) Its jaw hangs
open as you say that. Its eyes go dark, and the

2162
02:40:56,072 --> 02:40:58,695
body burns into ash and dissipates.

2163
02:40:58,695 --> 02:41:09,155
SAM: I drop to my knees, start crying, and say,
I'm so amazing!

2164
02:41:09,155 --> 02:41:14,598
TRAVIS: I never knew!

2165
02:41:14,598 --> 02:41:26,715
SAM: I have the power! The power of Greyskull! All
right, so I'll-- shit. That's it! Oh shit, so,

2166
02:41:26,715 --> 02:41:35,650
there's a guy. There's a guard, right? Oh, shit. I
can't do anything to him. So I'll just yell at

2167
02:41:35,650 --> 02:41:42,662
him, he was an assassin, sent to kill the Sultan!

2168
02:41:42,662 --> 02:41:44,603
MATT: Make a deception check.

2169
02:41:44,603 --> 02:41:46,421
TALIESIN: <i>Please</i> make a deception check.

2170
02:41:46,421 --> 02:41:48,816
MARISHA: Come on, come on! Come on, bard!

2171
02:41:48,816 --> 02:41:54,860
SAM: 34. That's 18 plus 16, whatever that is.

2172
02:41:54,860 --> 02:42:02,661
MATT: The efreeti stops his assault on you. It was
ready for another Fireball, and as you shout this,

2173
02:42:02,661 --> 02:42:13,502
it halts. (grunting) It's taken pause. You're not
sure it believes you. Everything that it's seeing

2174
02:42:13,731 --> 02:42:19,588
here, probably familiar with the pit fiend and the
power that it holds, versus one of the

2175
02:42:19,588 --> 02:42:24,955
Illuminated. You see it looking over, past your
shoulder. You glance over and you see five more

2176
02:42:24,955 --> 02:42:32,863
efreeti walking in the direction that it called.
It's taken pause, though. Meanwhile, I need you to

2177
02:42:32,863 --> 02:42:34,646
make another death saving throw.

2178
02:42:34,646 --> 02:42:36,741
ASHLEY: Can I run out to her?

2179
02:42:36,741 --> 02:42:41,507
LIAM: You're unconscious. Oh, Percy helped her!
That's right.

2180
02:42:41,507 --> 02:42:43,171
LAURA: 12.

2181
02:42:43,171 --> 02:42:51,484
MATT: Okay. So you're okay for now. However, you
still take poison damage from the poison pulsing

2182
02:42:51,484 --> 02:42:52,925
through your system.

2183
02:42:52,925 --> 02:42:55,941
LAURA: So that's an automatic fail. So thank god I
passed, because I would have just died!

2184
02:42:55,941 --> 02:43:01,838
TALIESIN: I'm going to finish dragging her in, so
that we can fix this.

2185
02:43:01,838 --> 02:43:03,768
LIAM: Are we out of combat?

2186
02:43:03,768 --> 02:43:05,485
MATT: Not yet.

2187
02:43:05,485 --> 02:43:09,300
TALIESIN: So no, I'm so sorry. I'm going out of
turn, then. I'll wait.

2188
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:14,750
MATT: There is the efreeti that is standing there
and has halted his assault. He's assessing the

2189
02:43:14,750 --> 02:43:15,950
situation.

2190
02:43:15,950 --> 02:43:17,757
LIAM: If we're out of combat, I'll do Lay on
Hands.

2191
02:43:17,757 --> 02:43:19,175
LAURA: We're not out of combat.

2192
02:43:19,175 --> 02:43:24,096
MATT: So that's the end of Vex's turn. Keyleth,
what are you doing? You're currently up where it

2193
02:43:24,096 --> 02:43:29,862
was, in your elemental form, with multiple efreeti
making their way down the road this way.

2194
02:43:29,862 --> 02:43:33,629
SAM: I got something! But I've got to wait my
turn.

2195
02:43:33,629 --> 02:43:36,761
MARISHA: Do we try to get in the mansion, or what
do we do?

2196
02:43:36,761 --> 02:43:39,504
TRAVIS: Yeah, mansion. Mansion.

2197
02:43:39,504 --> 02:43:41,576
LIAM: Safe bet.

2198
02:43:41,576 --> 02:43:50,662
MARISHA: Okay, can I, as part of my speed-- I
wasn't that high up, I was just hovering above--

2199
02:43:50,662 --> 02:43:56,360
can I go down, scoop up Scanlan, and both of us
bolt into the mansion?

2200
02:43:56,360 --> 02:43:58,511
LAURA: Why Scanlan? Why not me?

2201
02:43:58,511 --> 02:44:00,668
SAM: Every time you try to pick me up, I say no.

2202
02:44:00,668 --> 02:44:05,664
MARISHA: Vex is right on the outside of the door?

2203
02:44:05,664 --> 02:44:07,838
MATT: She's unconscious, and poisoned, and
bleeding out--

2204
02:44:07,838 --> 02:44:13,187
MARISHA: Right on the outside of the door. Okay,
I'm going to swoop down and drag her in.

2205
02:44:13,187 --> 02:44:15,737
LAURA: Vex will remember this.

2206
02:44:15,737 --> 02:44:17,622
MARISHA: Do I still have an action?

2207
02:44:17,622 --> 02:44:20,586
MATT: You would have an action, yes. You do.

2208
02:44:20,586 --> 02:44:23,399
MARISHA: I drop my elemental form.

2209
02:44:23,399 --> 02:44:25,667
MATT: Okay, so you are now back to Keyleth.

2210
02:44:25,667 --> 02:44:28,024
MARISHA: And I cast Protection from Poison on
her.

2211
02:44:28,024 --> 02:44:31,055
MATT: Okay, the poison is no longer pulsing in
your veins, Vex.

2212
02:44:31,055 --> 02:44:32,514
LAURA: Thank you.

2213
02:44:32,514 --> 02:44:38,791
MARISHA: Thank god I took that!

2214
02:44:38,791 --> 02:44:44,583
MATT: All right. So, that being the case, Grog,
you're up.

2215
02:44:44,583 --> 02:44:48,195
TRAVIS: Can I poke my head out the mansion and see
who's still outside?

2216
02:44:48,195 --> 02:44:55,401
MATT: Yeah, as you poke your head out, you can see
there is a singular efreet that is standing on the

2217
02:44:55,401 --> 02:45:01,435
edge there, that is, flame in his hand, crackling,
staring at Scanlan, but in a reserved position.

2218
02:45:01,435 --> 02:45:04,865
You see about five of them rounding the corner
towards the Arches.

2219
02:45:04,865 --> 02:45:07,831
TRAVIS: I look around. Is Scanlan still outside?

2220
02:45:07,831 --> 02:45:11,840
MATT: Scanlan is still outside. Scanlan's off in
the corner. You see him.

2221
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:24,667
TRAVIS: Pardon me, Master Australia. The slaves
need hosing down. And I retreat inside the

2222
02:45:24,667 --> 02:45:25,946
doorway.

2223
02:45:25,946 --> 02:45:27,462
MATT: Make a deception check, Grog.

2224
02:45:27,462 --> 02:45:28,986
LAURA: Oh no.

2225
02:45:28,986 --> 02:45:30,685
SAM: Right away, Grog.

2226
02:45:30,685 --> 02:45:33,698
TRAVIS: 13! Plus one.

2227
02:45:33,698 --> 02:45:45,460
MATT: The efreet standing there went from unsure
if truth to, "They're fucking lying." Eyes glare

2228
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:49,899
back at you, Scanlan. Vax. What are you doing?

2229
02:45:49,899 --> 02:45:54,466
LIAM: I scuttle over to my sister, then, and scoop
her head up. I'm looking out the door, watching

2230
02:45:54,466 --> 02:46:00,747
what's happening with Grog, give her a gentle
noogie and cast Lay on Hands, last five hit points

2231
02:46:00,747 --> 02:46:02,169
to bring her health to awake.

2232
02:46:02,169 --> 02:46:04,311
MATT: So you're now conscious, Vex.

2233
02:46:04,311 --> 02:46:06,834
LAURA: Well, that sucked.

2234
02:46:06,834 --> 02:46:09,668
MATT: Percy.

2235
02:46:09,668 --> 02:46:25,925
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my turn to wait for
the efreet to encounter Scanlan.

2236
02:46:25,925 --> 02:46:33,072
LIAM: I'll also say that I'll hold an attack if an
efreet pokes its face in the door.

2237
02:46:33,072 --> 02:46:44,382
MATT: We have more efreet heading down this
pathway here. Scanlan, it's your turn.

2238
02:46:44,382 --> 02:46:46,147
SAM: Handcone up.

2239
02:46:46,147 --> 02:46:48,994
ASHLEY: I think I got skipped!

2240
02:46:48,994 --> 02:46:50,795
MATT: Pike, you're after Scanlan.

2241
02:46:50,795 --> 02:46:55,620
LAURA: There's one person left before you.

2242
02:46:55,620 --> 02:46:58,107
ASHLEY: Oh, so Scanlan goes again?

2243
02:46:58,107 --> 02:47:03,794
MATT: Oh! I did accidentally miss your turn last
time in the mansion. What do you want to do, Pike?

2244
02:47:03,794 --> 02:47:08,446
ASHLEY: Can I peek outside?

2245
02:47:08,446 --> 02:47:10,331
LAURA: I'm in the mansion now.

2246
02:47:10,331 --> 02:47:11,722
ASHLEY: You're in the mansion?

2247
02:47:11,722 --> 02:47:13,708
LIAM: She's awake, but very low.

2248
02:47:13,708 --> 02:47:15,289
LAURA: I've got like one hit point.

2249
02:47:15,289 --> 02:47:16,194
LIAM: Five.

2250
02:47:16,194 --> 02:47:17,451
LAURA: I've got five hit points.

2251
02:47:17,451 --> 02:47:24,013
ASHLEY: Okay! I'm going to check what I have left
here, which is, let's see.

2252
02:47:24,013 --> 02:47:27,137
LIAM: Actually, let's say it's one. Not five.

2253
02:47:27,137 --> 02:47:32,281
MATT: You gave her one. Just one. You can do that;
you can mete it out.

2254
02:47:32,281 --> 02:47:36,330
ASHLEY: I'm going to do Cure Wounds at fifth
level.

2255
02:47:36,330 --> 02:47:39,571
MATT: 5th-level Cure Wounds onto you, Vex.

2256
02:47:39,571 --> 02:47:44,398
LIAM: I'm just an EMT; she's the doctor.

2257
02:47:44,398 --> 02:47:52,443
SAM: Oh! Yeah, I got something.

2258
02:47:52,443 --> 02:47:58,421
TALIESIN: That's why I'm holding my turn! If you
can make this go away, I will be very happy.

2259
02:47:58,421 --> 02:48:00,760
MATT: This is looking very bad.

2260
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:01,910
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2261
02:48:01,910 --> 02:48:03,597
MATT: This is the entire city guard now coming at
you.

2262
02:48:03,597 --> 02:48:05,365
LAURA: Oh Jeebus.

2263
02:48:05,365 --> 02:48:07,510
SAM: That's a book full of shit limericks.

2264
02:48:07,510 --> 02:48:10,205
MATT: How much does that heal?

2265
02:48:10,205 --> 02:48:14,598
ASHLEY: 35.

2266
02:48:14,598 --> 02:48:16,164
LAURA: Yay! Thank you!

2267
02:48:16,164 --> 02:48:20,726
MATT: Looking much better than you did a second
ago. That ends your turn, Pike, or are you going

2268
02:48:20,726 --> 02:48:22,184
to do anything else?

2269
02:48:22,184 --> 02:48:29,805
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay here in the mansion
because I'm useless.

2270
02:48:29,805 --> 02:48:31,072
LAURA: No!

2271
02:48:31,072 --> 02:48:35,555
MATT: Scanlan, you're now about to be flanked by a
series of efreet.

2272
02:48:35,555 --> 02:48:43,122
SAM: I take one step closer to the efreet, putting
me within 30 feet of him. I will hand cone up, and

2273
02:48:43,122 --> 02:48:55,784
I will sing to him to try to charm him. I'll sing:
(sings) my Grog don't like you, and he likes

2274
02:48:55,784 --> 02:49:04,796
everyone! And I should have known that you'd try
to run! But I got so caught up in my spells I

2275
02:49:04,796 --> 02:49:14,484
didn't see that you were trying to rat me out! But
I can't do that right now! I don't know.

2276
02:49:14,484 --> 02:49:18,148
So I'm going to cast Modify Memory at sixth
level.

2277
02:49:18,148 --> 02:49:20,774
ALL: Oh!

2278
02:49:20,774 --> 02:49:27,657
SAM: Ten minutes have not gone by! This whole
thing's taken two minutes, right?

2279
02:49:27,657 --> 02:49:31,724
MATT: This whole thing's been, roughly, from
beginning to end, about two minutes, yeah. From a

2280
02:49:31,724 --> 02:49:39,975
spatial positioning standpoint. Okay! It has to
make a wisdom saving throw. Because technically

2281
02:49:39,975 --> 02:49:43,311
you are fighting the creature because Grog made it
hostile again, it does get advantage on the saving throw.

2282
02:49:43,311 --> 02:49:44,894
SAM: Fuck!

2283
02:49:44,894 --> 02:49:47,839
LIAM: Can I use my Luck on him? I have one left.
Watching this.

2284
02:49:47,839 --> 02:49:50,916
MATT: I think it may be just an attack.

2285
02:49:50,916 --> 02:49:52,492
LIAM: I don't think so.

2286
02:49:52,492 --> 02:49:55,143
MATT: That's why I'm going to check, yo.

2287
02:49:55,143 --> 02:49:58,800
LIAM: I'm wrong about a lot of things, Matt.
In-game and out of game.

2288
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:01,040
MATT: I'm glad you're using it on enemy rolls
now!

2289
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:11,146
SAM: There's nothing in that book that says he
can't! There's something in <i>this</i> book that says

2290
02:50:11,146 --> 02:50:13,190
something much worse.

2291
02:50:13,190 --> 02:50:15,896
TALIESIN: Have you looked at the table of contents
yet? You should look at the table of contents.

2292
02:50:15,896 --> 02:50:17,619
It'll make you really happy.

2293
02:50:17,619 --> 02:50:19,790
MATT: You can also spend a luck point when an
attack roll is made against you.

2294
02:50:19,790 --> 02:50:21,436
LIAM: Just attack rolls, all right.

2295
02:50:21,436 --> 02:50:23,559
MATT: That would've been really powerful.

2296
02:50:23,559 --> 02:50:27,582
SAM: "Abuses of the Clergy"?

2297
02:50:27,582 --> 02:50:29,196
TALIESIN: That's my favorite chapter.

2298
02:50:29,196 --> 02:50:38,415
MATT: That's cocked. That is 19. What is your
spell DC, again?

2299
02:50:38,415 --> 02:50:39,590
SAM: 21.

2300
02:50:39,590 --> 02:50:46,023
MATT: You watch its eyes glaze over for a minute,
and the flame flickers out in its hand as it drops

2301
02:50:46,023 --> 02:50:47,980
to the side. What are you doing? What are you
modifying?

2302
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:57,220
SAM: I'm telling him: You heard this fiend pledge
to murder the Sultan. It's a Sultan, right? You

2303
02:50:57,220 --> 02:51:04,685
heard this fiend pledge to murder the Sultan and
you, joined with us, defeated him. You are brave.

2304
02:51:04,685 --> 02:51:08,444
You are strong. You should tell everyone this.

2305
02:51:08,444 --> 02:51:16,167
MATT: So you paint out this whole memory, this
whole image of watching this pit fiend, caught by

2306
02:51:16,167 --> 02:51:28,366
you guys and this Illuminated efreet, that this
plot was uncovered. The scuffle continued and you

2307
02:51:28,366 --> 02:51:33,341
make this entire epic battle, where somehow you're
the most powerful creature in the universe and

2308
02:51:33,341 --> 02:51:40,455
tore this thing asunder, practically one-handed,
next to this efreet. You instill it with the joy

2309
02:51:40,455 --> 02:51:47,487
and the pride that it just foiled a plot against
the Sultan. You watch as its limp self puffs up

2310
02:51:47,487 --> 02:51:52,457
with its hands on its hips. As the spell finishes
taking effect, rewriting its memory, it looks down

2311
02:51:52,457 --> 02:51:57,401
at you and goes, "You are brave, small one!"

2312
02:51:57,401 --> 02:51:59,712
SAM: Not as brave as you, sir!

2313
02:51:59,712 --> 02:52:05,446
MATT: "Your assistance will be remembered." He
puts his hand out to clasp yours. It encompasses

2314
02:52:05,446 --> 02:52:10,398
your entire elbow with a Beastmaster shake.

2315
02:52:10,398 --> 02:52:11,566
SAM: Noodle arm!

2316
02:52:11,566 --> 02:52:19,297
MATT: As the rest of the Illuminated swoop in now
to catch up, weapons drawn, the one that you were

2317
02:52:19,297 --> 02:52:29,600
talking to goes, "There is no need! We have
thwarted the plot. The Sultan is safe. This slaver

2318
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:42,180
"here, and his paltry allies, they helped me stop
it." The rest of the Illuminated go, "Piss off.

2319
02:52:42,180 --> 02:52:53,616
"You're blowing-- Stop blowing smoke. Well done."
The efreet that you cast on looks a little

2320
02:52:53,616 --> 02:53:03,818
deflated. "No, but seriously!" Points to the ashes
there on the ground and goes to join the rest of

2321
02:53:03,818 --> 02:53:08,609
them. They're giving him shit. You can tell
there's a rapport with them. They don't fully

2322
02:53:08,609 --> 02:53:14,963
believe his story, but there doesn't appear to be
any intent against you. Through a brief

2323
02:53:14,963 --> 02:53:23,108
conversation with them, they have no reason to
consider you an enemy. You've, through a single

2324
02:53:23,108 --> 02:53:30,374
series of lucky rolls and a perfect use of Modify
Memory, prevented the probably 10,000-ish

2325
02:53:30,374 --> 02:53:33,703
Illuminated that were in the city. Let me look at
the specific--

2326
02:53:33,703 --> 02:53:40,452
TALIESIN: I just want to double check, I still
have my attack, though? So I can actually hit him and--

2327
02:53:40,452 --> 02:53:43,196
SAM: Yeah, that's a great idea! Do that.

2328
02:53:43,196 --> 02:53:46,339
MATT: More than that! You're looking at 50,000
Illuminated that are in the City Guard.

2329
02:53:46,339 --> 02:53:48,560
SAM: 50,000?!

2330
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:55,573
TALIESIN: I'm going to saunter over to the pile of
ash and see if there's any proof that I can grab

2331
02:53:55,573 --> 02:53:57,064
that we took care of this.

2332
02:53:57,064 --> 02:54:06,209
TRAVIS: I would join him so I can grab the mallet,
the mace that the pit fiend had. Unless it turned

2333
02:54:06,209 --> 02:54:07,672
to ash as well.

2334
02:54:07,672 --> 02:54:12,376
MATT: It did not turn to ashes. However, when you
grab it, it is a dull, cold iron mace that is too

2335
02:54:12,376 --> 02:54:13,658
large for you to use.

2336
02:54:13,658 --> 02:54:15,014
TRAVIS: Too large for me?

2337
02:54:15,014 --> 02:54:18,019
MATT: I mean, you could use it, but it would be
disadvantage on attacks.

2338
02:54:18,019 --> 02:54:27,556
MARISHA: But he can carry it, right? Proof. You've
got to trade it for the Dawnmartyr armor. Is there

2339
02:54:27,556 --> 02:54:29,704
anything else left of him?

2340
02:54:29,704 --> 02:54:32,716
MATT: No, the rest of it's just ash. The rest of
it burned away into ash.

2341
02:54:32,716 --> 02:54:37,007
MARISHA: Didn't he have a symbol on his chest, or
whatever?

2342
02:54:37,007 --> 02:54:42,764
MATT: There is the symbol that he had, yeah. You
would find that, which is his mark of his station

2343
02:54:42,764 --> 02:54:44,026
within the embassy.

2344
02:54:44,026 --> 02:54:49,097
TALIESIN: Was he wearing a leather thong kind of
thing, with a flap? Because I feel like I could

2345
02:54:49,097 --> 02:54:50,073
really--

2346
02:54:50,073 --> 02:54:51,215
MATT: <i>Nope.</i>

2347
02:54:51,215 --> 02:54:52,163
TALIESIN: Okay.

2348
02:54:52,163 --> 02:55:02,394
MATT: Look at the mini-- Nope. Did you check for
anything else, while you're here? As apparently

2349
02:55:02,394 --> 02:55:05,051
the rest of the crowd has begun to come back and
fill in the Arches again.

2350
02:55:05,051 --> 02:55:06,545
LIAM: Let's am-scray.

2351
02:55:06,545 --> 02:55:08,690
TRAVIS: What about the rope she had? The lasso?

2352
02:55:08,690 --> 02:55:11,030
TALIESIN: Go look to see if there's anything
left.

2353
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:13,472
LAURA: I'll fly up there and see.

2354
02:55:13,472 --> 02:55:16,578
TALIESIN: And let's all take a short rest and then
go back.

2355
02:55:16,578 --> 02:55:22,876
MATT: Okay, there is her armor scattered across
the top of the wall. The bow is broken. There is

2356
02:55:22,876 --> 02:55:28,019
the longsword, and you do see the rope still
there, as well as a pair of nice boots.

2357
02:55:28,019 --> 02:55:29,409
LAURA: I'll grab it all.

2358
02:55:29,409 --> 02:55:32,396
SAM: Nice boots. You have so many fucking boots.

2359
02:55:32,396 --> 02:55:37,692
MATT: So you grab the sword, you grab the boots,
and you grab the lasso.

2360
02:55:37,692 --> 02:55:41,161
SAM: No one wears shoes in this world? Only
boots?

2361
02:55:41,161 --> 02:55:49,161
MATT: Everybody ducks inside of the mansion. All
right. As you guys all duck into the mansion, take

2362
02:55:49,161 --> 02:55:54,144
a rest, we're going to take a bathroom break here.
We'll be back here in a minute. We have a little

2363
02:55:54,144 --> 02:55:58,128
more story resolution to go through before I
finish the episode tonight, so hold off just a

2364
02:55:58,128 --> 02:55:59,276
second.

2365
02:55:59,276 --> 02:56:01,337
MARISHA: That was a three hour fight.

2366
02:56:01,337 --> 02:56:10,176
MATT: And Scanlan, you can go ahead and get your--
This is Mythcarver in its awoken form.

2367
02:56:10,176 --> 02:56:17,300
LAURA: Matt, before I go in the mansion, I gather
up those gems that I threw at the efreet.

2368
02:56:17,300 --> 02:56:22,434
MATT: Okay, gather gems. We are having a giveaway
tonight. Our fantastic friends at Wyrmwood are

2369
02:56:22,434 --> 02:56:30,555

2370
02:56:30,555 --> 02:56:34,888

2371
02:56:34,888 --> 02:56:40,942
We'll have the announcement of who wins this at
the end of the break. Okay, after break, we'll

2372
02:56:40,942 --> 02:56:43,308

2373

2374
02:56:46,849 --> 02:56:47,978
in a few minutes.

2375
02:56:47,978 --> 02:56:49,900
MARISHA: Woo, we didn't die!

2376
02:56:49,900 --> 03:05:41,561
[break]

2377
03:05:41,561 --> 03:05:45,828
MATT: Hello, guys, and welcome back to Critical
Role! We do have a winner in the chat room:

2378
03:05:45,828 --> 03:05:55,836
jenksone9. You are going to be winning this
awesome Wyrmwood dice box. Congratulations! Make

2379
03:05:55,836 --> 03:05:59,564
sure that you talk with our mods and folks in the
chat room to get your information.

2380
03:05:59,564 --> 03:06:04,032
Congratulations, and thank you for entering!
Awesome.

2381
03:06:04,032 --> 03:06:12,030
So. Returning to the circumstance. You, Vox
Machina: bruised, beaten, and through some clutch

2382
03:06:12,030 --> 03:06:17,301
timing-- and thank god some of you guys got
initiative at the top of that round. Maybe we'll

2383
03:06:17,301 --> 03:06:20,603
talk more about this on Talks on Tuesday, because
there's some shit that could have gone really

2384
03:06:20,603 --> 03:06:27,053
wrong if you guys didn't get initiative or if you
hadn't grappled him at the beginning. Yeah, it

2385
03:06:27,053 --> 03:06:32,666
would've been bad. Anyway, while you guys are
taking a short rest-- so you can go ahead and use

2386
03:06:32,666 --> 03:06:36,543
as many of your hit dice to heal up, if you want
to.

2387
03:06:36,543 --> 03:06:40,203
LAURA: We probably should've done that on the
break.

2388
03:06:40,203 --> 03:06:52,183
SAM: I can sing a song to heal you all by 1d12. Is
that right?

2389
03:06:52,183 --> 03:06:55,129
MATT: On top of whatever you used your hit dice
on, you also heal 1d12.

2390
03:06:55,129 --> 03:07:05,042
SAM: Okay, I will sing a song. I will sing:
(singing) Heal thee! With a song, heal thee, all

2391
03:07:05,042 --> 03:07:08,731
night, all night, all night long. Heal thee.

2392
03:07:08,731 --> 03:07:14,014
LIAM: So 1d12, and then we do whatever after
that.

2393
03:07:14,014 --> 03:07:15,058
MATT: Correct.

2394
03:07:15,058 --> 03:07:16,550
ASHLEY: 1d12 plus what?

2395
03:07:16,550 --> 03:07:19,394
MATT: Well, he rolls it, so Sam, go ahead and roll
that.

2396
03:07:19,394 --> 03:07:20,999
SAM: It's a 12!

2397
03:07:20,999 --> 03:07:25,196
MATT: Everyone heals 12 hit points, and then let
me know how much you heal based on your hit dice.

2398
03:07:25,196 --> 03:07:26,834
TALIESIN: Fully healed.

2399
03:07:26,834 --> 03:07:28,327
MATT: All right, Percy's fully healed.

2400
03:07:28,327 --> 03:07:34,994
TALIESIN: Oh, and short rest, which means I get
all that back, and I get that back.

2401
03:07:34,994 --> 03:07:40,577
SAM: Hit dice, huh? Okay, lots of math going on.

2402
03:07:40,577 --> 03:07:45,813
MATT: Is anyone looking at the items you found?

2403
03:07:45,813 --> 03:07:48,330
LAURA: Sure, I'll look at my stuff.

2404
03:07:48,330 --> 03:07:51,306
MATT: Okay. Boots or rope?

2405
03:07:51,306 --> 03:07:54,298
TRAVIS: I healed up to 168.

2406
03:07:54,298 --> 03:07:56,169
MATT: 168 on Grog. All righty.

2407
03:07:56,169 --> 03:07:59,959
LIAM: I'm up to full. 99.

2408
03:07:59,959 --> 03:08:01,455
MATT: Vax is full.

2409
03:08:01,455 --> 03:08:05,204
SAM: I'm up to 85.

2410
03:08:05,204 --> 03:08:07,068
MATT: 85 on Scanlan.

2411
03:08:07,068 --> 03:08:11,724
MARISHA: I am up to 80.

2412
03:08:11,724 --> 03:08:13,813
LAURA: I'm up to 100.

2413
03:08:13,813 --> 03:08:17,311
MATT: Awesome, so boots or rope, Vex?

2414
03:08:17,311 --> 03:08:21,225
LAURA: The rope, and I'm going to pass the boots
to Keyleth to look at.

2415
03:08:21,225 --> 03:08:23,337
MATT: Okay, so I'm going to pass these over to you
guys.

2416
03:08:23,337 --> 03:08:24,878
TRAVIS: Oh god!

2417
03:08:24,878 --> 03:08:40,571
LAURA: Ooh! Here you go. I passed this to you so
you could look at them. This is the Rope of

2418
03:08:40,571 --> 03:08:45,840
Entanglement. The rope is 30 feet long and weighs
three pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and

2419
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:50,660
use an action to speak its command word, the other
end darts forward to entangle a creature you see

2420
03:08:50,660 --> 03:08:58,840
within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed a
DC of 15 dexterity, or become restrained.

2421
03:08:58,840 --> 03:09:01,873
TRAVIS: Do you read that slow all the time?

2422
03:09:01,873 --> 03:09:09,068
LAURA: Yes. You can release a creature by a bonus
action. Target restrained by the rope can use an

2423
03:09:09,068 --> 03:09:11,850
action-- I'm trying to scan it.

2424
03:09:11,850 --> 03:09:17,090
MATT: So you essentially release the rope as an
action toward a creature within 20 feet, and it

2425
03:09:17,090 --> 03:09:19,560
tries to wrap it and restrain it.

2426
03:09:19,706 --> 03:09:21,645
TRAVIS: They'd essentially be grappled.

2427
03:09:21,645 --> 03:09:25,032
MATT: Restrained. Grapple just means their
movement is brought to zero. Restrained means their

2428
03:09:25,032 --> 03:09:28,607
movement is brought to zero, attack rolls against
them have advantage, and attack rolls that they

2429
03:09:28,607 --> 03:09:31,829
make have disadvantage. And they have disadvantage
on dexterity saving throws.

2430
03:09:31,829 --> 03:09:33,585
LAURA: And it's a bonus action?

2431
03:09:33,585 --> 03:09:35,190
MATT: It's an action.

2432
03:09:35,190 --> 03:09:42,007
TALIESIN: Do ranged attacks also have advantage?
Oh! So you grab something and we start whaling on

2433
03:09:42,007 --> 03:09:43,862
it from a distance?

2434
03:09:43,862 --> 03:09:52,349
MATT: Well, grapple is different from restrained.
With the rope, yeah, you can do that. You're your

2435
03:09:52,349 --> 03:09:54,446
own moving gallows.

2436
03:09:54,446 --> 03:10:01,376
TRAVIS: It can be destroyed. It has 20 hit points
and an AC of 20. Is it limited by the size of the

2437
03:10:01,376 --> 03:10:02,691
creature?

2438
03:10:02,691 --> 03:10:04,173
MATT: Yeah.

2439
03:10:04,173 --> 03:10:07,872
TRAVIS: I can't restrain a fire giant?

2440
03:10:07,872 --> 03:10:10,804
MATT: Probably not going to work on Thordak, just
saying.

2441
03:10:10,804 --> 03:10:19,665
MARISHA: These boots appear to actually be boots
that my people might have made. They are Boots of

2442
03:10:19,665 --> 03:10:26,979
Spider Climbing. The wearer can spend an action to
cast Spider Climb on themselves, no concentration

2443
03:10:26,979 --> 03:10:38,100
required. The effect lasts for an hour. Spider
Climb lets you-- I go to Percy. He's waving dibs.

2444
03:10:38,100 --> 03:10:41,095
TALIESIN: Yes, no, this is definitely for me.

2445
03:10:41,095 --> 03:10:44,265
LAURA: Does anybody want this rope?

2446
03:10:44,265 --> 03:10:45,596
TRAVIS: Hello.

2447
03:10:45,596 --> 03:10:47,398
LAURA: You want the Rope of Entanglement?

2448
03:10:47,398 --> 03:10:50,039
ASHLEY: I healed to 74, B-T-W.

2449
03:10:50,039 --> 03:10:51,991
MATT: Thank you, Pike.

2450
03:10:51,991 --> 03:10:55,219
LAURA: Did I say what I healed to? I did, right?

2451
03:10:55,219 --> 03:11:03,198
MATT: You did, yeah. So as you guys finish a short
rest, you've taken in the circumstance. You've

2452
03:11:03,198 --> 03:11:07,332
narrowly avoided a very, <i>very</i> bad situation with
the city.

2453
03:11:07,332 --> 03:11:12,311
MARISHA: I thought that the guards were going to
show up way sooner. We lucked out. They've got a

2454
03:11:12,311 --> 03:11:14,495
low response time in this city.

2455
03:11:14,495 --> 03:11:18,426
TRAVIS: It wasn't bad. It was only a couple
minutes. Better than L.A.

2456
03:11:18,426 --> 03:11:24,210
[static]

2457
03:11:24,210 --> 03:11:35,674
MATT: What do you guys want to do? You're inside
the mansion. You still have the two slaves you

2458
03:11:35,674 --> 03:11:36,997
acquired.

2459
03:11:36,997 --> 03:11:41,139
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, we should talk to them. They're
not in chains, though. Did the servants get the

2460
03:11:41,139 --> 03:11:42,599
chains off of them?

2461
03:11:42,599 --> 03:11:45,421
MATT: The servants did take the chains off of
them. They're both hiding in the back of the foyer

2462
03:11:45,421 --> 03:11:47,094
as you guys are resting.

2463
03:11:47,094 --> 03:11:48,580
TRAVIS: Go on, Vex. See what they want.

2464
03:11:48,580 --> 03:11:54,250
LAURA: All right, I wander over to them. Hello.

2465
03:11:54,250 --> 03:11:56,490
MATT: "Hi."

2466
03:11:56,490 --> 03:11:58,462
LAURA: Hi. What's your name, darling?

2467
03:11:58,462 --> 03:12:08,791
MATT: They both seem a little more relaxed than
when you first spoke with them. "I'm Kyor. He's Hunin."

2468
03:12:08,791 --> 03:12:11,459
LAURA: Kyor and Hunin? Okay.

2469
03:12:11,459 --> 03:12:14,359
MATT: "Thank you."

2470
03:12:14,359 --> 03:12:16,750
LAURA: Of course!

2471
03:12:16,750 --> 03:12:19,014
MATT: "Whatever you need."

2472
03:12:19,014 --> 03:12:21,607
LAURA: How long have you been captured?

2473
03:12:21,607 --> 03:12:25,541
MATT: "Maybe a year?"

2474
03:12:25,541 --> 03:12:29,208
LAURA: Oh no! And where did they take you from?

2475
03:12:29,208 --> 03:12:35,557
MATT: "We were taken from our mother, on the
poorer side of Therines."

2476
03:12:35,557 --> 03:12:40,979
LAURA: Therines? Where is that?

2477
03:12:40,979 --> 03:12:43,757
MATT: "It's in Wildemount."

2478
03:12:43,757 --> 03:12:49,517
LAURA: Oh, okay! We know where that is. Yeah?

2479
03:12:49,517 --> 03:12:51,492
MARISHA: They're from Wildemount?

2480
03:12:51,492 --> 03:12:53,691
MATT: "She sold us off."

2481
03:12:53,691 --> 03:12:56,190
LAURA: <i>She</i> sold you?! Why?

2482
03:12:56,190 --> 03:12:59,627
MATT: Because we're special.

2483
03:12:59,627 --> 03:13:01,298
LAURA: You are special.

2484
03:13:01,298 --> 03:13:05,131
MARISHA: You're different, too!

2485
03:13:05,131 --> 03:13:14,256
LAURA: All of us are rather different. I hate that
music when I'm talking. It makes me creeped out.

2486
03:13:14,256 --> 03:13:17,403
SAM: Sorry, I'll stop playing.

2487
03:13:17,403 --> 03:13:20,612
LAURA: What are you going to do to me, you creepy
little boys?

2488
03:13:20,612 --> 03:13:23,337
MATT: I've changed the music. For you.

2489
03:13:23,337 --> 03:13:28,522
SAM: Wait, did we get their names yet?

2490
03:13:28,522 --> 03:13:36,080
LAURA: Yes, Kyor and Hunin. Well, would you feel
safe going back to them, or would you like to be

2491
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:40,948
with us for a while? To your mother, I mean.

2492
03:13:40,948 --> 03:13:45,109
MATT: You can see Hunin, who's being really quiet
and basically letting Kyor talk, and you get the

2493
03:13:45,109 --> 03:13:57,434
sense he's probably the more talkative of the two.
"We have no real care or love for her, for what

2494
03:13:57,434 --> 03:13:59,087
"she's done."

2495
03:13:59,087 --> 03:14:00,664
LAURA: Understandable.

2496
03:14:00,664 --> 03:14:05,521
MATT: "Whatever the fates bring us toward, I
suppose. We'll walk that."

2497
03:14:05,521 --> 03:14:07,638
LAURA: Well, they've brought you toward us,
darling.

2498
03:14:07,638 --> 03:14:11,319
MATT: He still seems uncomfortable and very much
like, "what are you going to do?"

2499
03:14:11,319 --> 03:14:20,251
LAURA: We're not slavers. We don't want you as
slaves. If you'd like to stay with us, we can try

2500
03:14:20,251 --> 03:14:28,790
to keep you safe. At least, we can get you out of
this Fire Plane, if all things go well.

2501
03:14:28,790 --> 03:14:37,570
MATT: Looks over to Hunin. Hunin looks and shakes
his head. "This place is terrible. If you know a

2502
03:14:37,570 --> 03:14:40,572
"way out, please, take us with you."

2503
03:14:40,572 --> 03:14:43,081
TALIESIN: How do you feel about snow?

2504
03:14:43,081 --> 03:14:45,563
MATT: "I like snow. Where we're from, there's lots
of snow."

2505
03:14:45,563 --> 03:14:47,373
TALIESIN: Well, that will do, then!

2506
03:14:47,373 --> 03:14:52,499
MARISHA: There's a very nice city where we came
from. Might be able to start a new life there.

2507
03:14:52,499 --> 03:14:56,372
MATT: "Okay."

2508
03:14:56,372 --> 03:14:58,385
LAURA: How old are you?

2509
03:14:58,385 --> 03:15:04,537
MATT: "We're both about..." You can see they have
to think for a second. You get the sense that they

2510
03:15:04,537 --> 03:15:07,354
probably didn't have a very good education,
either, where they came from.

2511
03:15:07,354 --> 03:15:09,017
TRAVIS: Respect.

2512
03:15:09,017 --> 03:15:12,020
MATT: "About 15?"

2513
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:13,910
LAURA: 15?

2514
03:15:13,910 --> 03:15:20,531
TRAVIS: I think I might be that many.

2515
03:15:20,531 --> 03:15:23,297
LAURA: Well, you can come with us for a while, all
right?

2516
03:15:23,297 --> 03:15:25,241
MATT: "Yes."

2517
03:15:25,241 --> 03:15:34,379
LAURA: All right. Did you eat some chicken? Have
some chicken. Put some meat on your little bones.

2518
03:15:34,379 --> 03:15:39,301
MATT: The other spectral servants come and take
their hands, lift up, and lead them toward the

2519
03:15:39,301 --> 03:15:44,310
kitchen where they both excitedly seem to enjoy
the prospect of fresh food.

2520
03:15:44,310 --> 03:15:46,702
LAURA: Eat quickly, though, because we'll probably
be leaving soon.

2521
03:15:46,702 --> 03:15:51,630
SAM: We could leave them here while we go do our
business.

2522
03:15:51,630 --> 03:15:55,871
MARISHA: We don't need to check back in with
Senokir. He already has a way to get hold of us.

2523
03:15:55,871 --> 03:15:59,648
LAURA: So we could just go straight to-- Okay.

2524
03:15:59,648 --> 03:16:04,067
MARISAHA: If you guys are fine with it, I think we
can check back in to repay our debt to Senokir

2525
03:16:04,067 --> 03:16:05,495
another time?

2526
03:16:05,495 --> 03:16:07,647
SAM: We need to get our armor.

2527
03:16:07,647 --> 03:16:09,638
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean.

2528
03:16:09,638 --> 03:16:15,257
MARISHA: But we can stealth there, get the armor,
and then get out.

2529
03:16:15,257 --> 03:16:23,981
LIAM: Wait a second, though. Grog, that magic
bucket you have, does it make champagne?

2530
03:16:23,981 --> 03:16:25,261
TRAVIS: No.

2531
03:16:25,261 --> 03:16:26,589
LIAM: Does it make ale?

2532
03:16:26,589 --> 03:16:27,702
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2533
03:16:27,702 --> 03:16:34,387
LIAM: Pour it out. I walk over to Scanlan, I grab
him by the face and cheeks. Look at this guy! I

2534
03:16:34,387 --> 03:16:39,449
scoop him up and I put him on my shoulders. I walk
over to Keyleth and I say: Look at these fucking

2535
03:16:39,449 --> 03:16:48,575
two! To Scanlan and Keyleth, the two biggest
fucking heroes I know! Yeah!

2536
03:16:48,575 --> 03:16:57,468
TRAVIS: Shit, I'll drink to that! I take the jug
and I stick my face in. I go: Beer! It makes four

2537
03:16:57,468 --> 03:16:59,536
gallons of beer.

2538
03:16:59,536 --> 03:17:07,261
LIAM: And can I just say: Thank you, Scanlan.
Thanks, Keyleth.

2539
03:17:07,261 --> 03:17:12,131
MARISHA: Thank all of us. We did this together!

2540
03:17:12,131 --> 03:17:16,117
SAM: We did do this together, and we didn't do
anything that you wouldn't have done for us.

2541
03:17:16,117 --> 03:17:18,337
TALIESIN: He's going to drink all of the beer if
you don't stop.

2542
03:17:18,337 --> 03:17:20,041
LAURA: Oh, Grog! Share.

2543
03:17:20,041 --> 03:17:21,873
LIAM: Is there anything left?

2544
03:17:21,873 --> 03:17:24,502
MATT: It sloshes a bit. There's enough for half a
cup.

2545
03:17:24,502 --> 03:17:26,612
LIAM: For everybody, or for one?

2546
03:17:26,612 --> 03:17:27,956
MATT: For one.

2547
03:17:27,956 --> 03:17:30,070
LIAM: For one half cup?! Is that all it does?

2548
03:17:30,070 --> 03:17:33,285
TRAVIS: It makes four gallons. I'm a big guy.

2549
03:17:33,285 --> 03:17:35,771
LAURA: I take a teeny sip. Pike, would you like
any ale?

2550
03:17:35,771 --> 03:17:38,240
SAM: We have a wine cellar.

2551
03:17:38,240 --> 03:17:40,763
LIAM: You there, blue fellow!

2552
03:17:40,763 --> 03:17:45,425
SAM: Not a fellow! Not a fellow. A lady.

2553
03:17:45,425 --> 03:17:51,013
LAURA: Pass it down. All right. So should we take
the boys with us, then? Because we're not

2554
03:17:51,013 --> 03:17:52,918
necessarily coming back here?

2555
03:17:52,918 --> 03:18:00,944
MARISHA: I have just enough room in my spell bus
to take us all back.

2556
03:18:00,944 --> 03:18:06,074
LAURA: Well, then I bamf Trinket back in the--
well, I can bamf him back in when we-- I'm going

2557
03:18:06,074 --> 03:18:13,417
to leave him out for a while. Let him stretch it
out. He's been confined for a bit. You did so good

2558
03:18:13,417 --> 03:18:14,896
in that fight!

2559
03:18:14,896 --> 03:18:18,380
MATT: (bear noises) Rubs against you. He seems
pretty proud.

2560
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:21,191
LAURA: You did better than your mom. Yeah.

2561
03:18:21,191 --> 03:18:22,907
MATT: (bear noises)

2562
03:18:22,907 --> 03:18:27,357
LIAM: I'm going to walk up to the corner. I've
still got Scanlan on my shoulders. I'm going to

2563
03:18:27,357 --> 03:18:36,277
invert my hands and grab him and turn him upside
down. Hey, you know I'm teasing, but you're an

2564
03:18:36,277 --> 03:18:40,254
amazing man. You are a hero.

2565
03:18:40,254 --> 03:18:43,084
SAM: That means a lot, Vax.

2566
03:18:43,084 --> 03:18:45,626
LIAM: I shut him up and I kiss him.

2567
03:18:45,626 --> 03:18:47,311
SAM: Oh, upside-down Spider-man!

2568
03:18:47,311 --> 03:18:52,713
LIAM: Just take it! Take the compliment, you
fucker!

2569
03:18:52,713 --> 03:19:06,912
SAM: Oh! That's not the first upside-down elf man
kiss I've ever had, but it's probably top three.

2570
03:19:06,912 --> 03:19:12,195
LIAM: I go to Scanlan's cheek. (patting, slap)

2571
03:19:12,195 --> 03:19:15,120
SAM: I can't take that much damage!

2572
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:16,900
LIAM: That's okay, do one for me.

2573
03:19:16,900 --> 03:19:18,733
SAM: (grunts weakly)

2574
03:19:18,733 --> 03:19:21,845
LIAM: I'm going to go find my sister. I'll talk to
you later.

2575
03:19:21,845 --> 03:19:25,964
MATT: That would've been a great Bigby's Hand
moment.

2576
03:19:25,964 --> 03:19:29,346
LIAM: Back out the door.

2577
03:19:29,346 --> 03:19:34,180
MATT: So you guys have gathered your things.
You've gathered your two companions.

2578
03:19:34,180 --> 03:19:40,188
MARISHA: We should probably slave ourselves up
again. We don't have to go far.

2579
03:19:40,188 --> 03:19:42,772
MATT: You still have the illusions.

2580
03:19:42,772 --> 03:19:46,025
LAURA: Oh, you kissed Keyleth in the middle of
that fight!

2581
03:19:46,025 --> 03:19:47,328
LIAM: Absolutely!

2582
03:19:47,328 --> 03:19:49,422
MARISHA: That is weird!

2583
03:19:49,422 --> 03:19:55,112
MATT: You totally kissed your sister.

2584
03:19:55,112 --> 03:19:57,163
TRAVIS: Nasty!

2585
03:19:57,163 --> 03:20:02,003
MATT: And then right now planted one on a flaming,
dark-skinned, bearded fellow.

2586
03:20:02,003 --> 03:20:07,540
LIAM: Yeah. Hey, guys, that's your hangup, not
mine.

2587
03:20:07,540 --> 03:20:10,361
(laughter)

2588
03:20:10,361 --> 03:20:12,932
MARISHA: I feel like I'm learning so much about
you, Vax.

2589
03:20:12,932 --> 03:20:15,527
LIAM: My name is pronounced <i>Liam.</i>

2590
03:20:15,527 --> 03:20:18,544
(laughter)

2591
03:20:18,544 --> 03:20:24,208
MATT: As you guys gather your things, you make
your way back out into the Thoroughfare of the

2592
03:20:24,208 --> 03:20:29,823
Arches, where you can see there is now a heavier
patrolling guard of Illuminated in the vicinity.

2593
03:20:29,823 --> 03:20:32,170
MARISHA: We put our chains back on.

2594
03:20:32,170 --> 03:20:36,961
LAURA: I walk up to Percy before we put our
horrible chains back on, and I grab his hand, and

2595
03:20:36,961 --> 03:20:40,150
I give him a peck on the cheek and whisper: Thank
you.

2596
03:20:40,150 --> 03:20:45,366
TALIESIN: You're welcome. And yes, that was weird
for me, too. Just weird right now.

2597
03:20:45,366 --> 03:20:46,693
LAURA: Just a peck.

2598
03:20:46,693 --> 03:20:48,282
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you, but it's weird.

2599
03:20:48,282 --> 03:20:56,294
LIAM: After my bit with Scanlan, I put the ring
back on and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to

2600
03:20:56,294 --> 03:21:01,894
it, and she hears behind her: (mocking) Oh, thank
you. I love you so much.

2601
03:21:01,894 --> 03:21:03,295
LAURA: I go (grunts).

2602
03:21:03,295 --> 03:21:05,263
MATT: You get an elbow right to the stomach.

2603
03:21:05,263 --> 03:21:07,727
LIAM: No, she's got to roll for it with
disadvantage because I'm invisible!

2604
03:21:07,727 --> 03:21:11,115
MATT: She's grown up with you. She knows exactly
where you are going to whisper into her ear.

2605
03:21:11,115 --> 03:21:17,381
LIAM: (mocking) Your hair is so white and
beautiful. I'm so in love.

2606
03:21:17,381 --> 03:21:19,824
LAURA: Go away.

2607
03:21:19,824 --> 03:21:21,652
LIAM: (mocking) You're a shithead!

2608
03:21:21,652 --> 03:21:29,390
MATT: As you guys begin to make your way,
backtracking to the location of Juuraiel's

2609
03:21:29,390 --> 03:21:37,865
building... without incident. Though there are a
few tense moments of you guys staying in the

2610
03:21:37,865 --> 03:21:43,140
public eye, you've watched how other people walked
about the city, the lack of communication from

2611
03:21:43,140 --> 03:21:49,487
folks that don't seem to be on the upper echelon,
and avoiding as much of the Illuminated as you

2612
03:21:49,487 --> 03:21:52,989
can, with their flaming amulets.

2613
03:21:52,989 --> 03:22:00,116
Eventually, you find your way back to the large
slowly spiraling black-and-gold abode of Juuraiel.

2614
03:22:00,116 --> 03:22:05,746
The door has the same knob on the front. You
knock. The door is lifted and the two fire giant

2615
03:22:05,746 --> 03:22:14,610
slaves greet you and lead you into the home. There
across the way on the other side of her large

2616
03:22:14,610 --> 03:22:20,154
desk, still waiting, arms crossed, fingers
intertwined, you see grinning the ever opulently

2617
03:22:20,154 --> 03:22:25,974
dressed Juuraiel. Waiting for you all to approach
quietly, with a smile on her face. Her eyebrows

2618
03:22:25,974 --> 03:22:32,470
tensed and furrowed, expecting either a sweet
victory or word of a sweet defeat. Either way, she wins.

2619
03:22:32,470 --> 03:22:38,619
TALIESIN: We have the necklace.

2620
03:22:38,619 --> 03:22:43,221
MARISHA: I take out the necklace and throw it at
her feet. Or on the table in front of her.

2621
03:22:43,221 --> 03:22:51,231
MATT: She reaches down and plucks it; it dangles.
She looks at it. "So it is done, then?"

2622
03:22:51,231 --> 03:22:56,569
MARISHA: If word has not reached you by now,
honestly, I'm quite surprised.

2623
03:22:56,569 --> 03:23:01,060
TRAVIS: I'm not. We were super stealthy as
requested.

2624
03:23:01,060 --> 03:23:02,201
LAURA: Yeah, we were.

2625
03:23:02,201 --> 03:23:04,272
MARISHA: Word of mouth. It's a small city.

2626
03:23:04,272 --> 03:23:07,754
TALIESIN: Died in disgrace, as well. Plot to
overthrow the sultan.

2627
03:23:07,754 --> 03:23:10,195
LIAM: A disembodied voice says: Totally.

2628
03:23:10,195 --> 03:23:25,000
MATT: You can see the brow unfurls ever so
slightly, and a look of peace washes over her face

2629
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:29,821
for a moment. She takes the small amulet in her
hand and clutches her fingers around it and closes

2630
03:23:29,821 --> 03:23:43,418
her eyes. "You've done me a great service this
day, and you have upheld your end of the bargain.

2631
03:23:43,418 --> 03:23:51,694
"For this, I thank you." She pulls a drawer open in
the desk and plops it in, slams it shut. (slam) "I

2632
03:23:51,930 --> 03:23:59,012
"absolve you of the ownership I have against you.
My servants will collect your necklaces. Thank

2633
03:23:59,012 --> 03:24:04,509
"you. Thank you very much."

2634
03:24:04,509 --> 03:24:08,312
LAURA: Thank you for the plate mail, as well.

2635
03:24:08,312 --> 03:24:17,106
MATT: "Yes. My apologizes. It's been a long day."
She reaches up and takes the armor pieces there

2636
03:24:17,106 --> 03:24:21,372
and sets it on the edge of the desk.

2637
03:24:21,372 --> 03:24:25,975
SAM: Just curious, what do you say we play one
hand?

2638
03:24:25,975 --> 03:24:27,592
TALIESIN, LAURA, and TRAVIS: No!

2639
03:24:27,592 --> 03:24:29,336
SAM: Oh, okay. All right.

2640
03:24:29,336 --> 03:24:31,537
MARISHA: I think you've done enough gambling for
today.

2641
03:24:31,537 --> 03:24:32,910
ASHLEY: Just for funsies.

2642
03:24:32,910 --> 03:24:40,172
MATT: "Now, the deal is done. Get out."

2643
03:24:40,172 --> 03:24:42,107
LAURA: Goodbye. Thank you.

2644
03:24:42,107 --> 03:24:48,876
MARISHA: Would you care if we do a little
teleportation spell in your living room?

2645
03:24:48,876 --> 03:24:52,379
MATT: "I would recommend doing it towards the
foyer door."

2646
03:24:52,379 --> 03:24:55,416
MARISHA: Right, because you've got-- thank you.

2647
03:24:55,416 --> 03:25:01,039
LAURA: Thank you. Do you want to put it on now,
Pike?

2648
03:25:01,039 --> 03:25:03,375
MARISHA: (chanting) Put it on!

2649
03:25:03,375 --> 03:25:06,541
LIAM: We came all this way.

2650
03:25:06,541 --> 03:25:08,059
ASHLEY: Well, okay.

2651
03:25:08,059 --> 03:25:13,516
MATT: Okay, so you guys help her get out of her
armor. The fire giant's awkwardly watching from a

2652
03:25:13,516 --> 03:25:15,292
distance as she's down to her skivvies.

2653
03:25:15,292 --> 03:25:17,523
SAM: I'm going to hold up a towel.

2654
03:25:17,523 --> 03:25:20,225
MATT: Well, she doesn't have to get fully naked in
here. She's not naked under the armor. There's

2655
03:25:20,225 --> 03:25:21,916
padding and stuff.

2656
03:25:21,916 --> 03:25:24,600
TRAVIS: She's Pike. She's hardcore. I don't know.

2657
03:25:24,600 --> 03:25:31,734
MATT: That'd be painful as shit. Pinches
everywhere. But the plate, which is about human

2658
03:25:31,734 --> 03:25:35,567
size, it's too large for Pike, and it gets loose
when you get inside of it. It's hanging off of

2659
03:25:35,567 --> 03:25:39,941
her. Once you get the last piece of the armor on,
she looks like a child wearing her parents'

2660
03:25:39,941 --> 03:25:41,929
clothing.

2661
03:25:41,929 --> 03:25:43,255
TRAVIS: Perfect.

2662
03:25:43,255 --> 03:25:53,049
MATT: And then, with a creaking sound, all armor
snaps to her form, and you watch as the beautiful

2663
03:25:53,049 --> 03:25:59,426
brass scrolling across the armor itself begins to
brighten. You can see bits where the scrolling

2664
03:25:59,426 --> 03:26:05,902
glows with this pulsing, almost internal fire, and
the rubies gleam. And you see the air around her

2665
03:26:05,902 --> 03:26:12,412
begin to distort, like the air distortion over a
hot flame.

2666
03:26:12,412 --> 03:26:17,034
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Oh jeez!

2667
03:26:17,034 --> 03:26:19,713
SAM: We've got to read it to you.

2668
03:26:19,713 --> 03:26:22,593
LAURA: And you got rubies all over you and stuff!

2669
03:26:22,593 --> 03:26:25,041
LIAM: Well, completionists, we fucking did it.

2670
03:26:25,041 --> 03:26:27,412
MARISHA: Legendary weapons!

2671
03:26:27,412 --> 03:26:30,092
ASHLEY: Aw, I can't really read it.

2672
03:26:30,092 --> 03:26:32,221
SAM: Laura will read it in Ashley's voice.

2673
03:26:32,221 --> 03:26:34,375
MATT: Yeah, Travis. Read it in Ashley's voice.

2674
03:26:34,375 --> 03:26:38,190
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh, beautiful brass
scrolling and priceless--

2675
03:26:38,190 --> 03:26:39,629
ASHLEY: All right, that's a little--

2676
03:26:39,629 --> 03:26:42,123
(laughter)

2677
03:26:42,123 --> 03:26:46,675
LAURA: Beautiful brass scrolling and priceless cut
rubies adorn this silver set of amor.

2678
03:26:46,675 --> 03:26:48,575
TRAVIS: Don't read the whole thing.

2679
03:26:48,575 --> 03:26:49,933
LAURA: No?

2680
03:26:49,933 --> 03:26:51,633
TRAVIS: It's up to Ashley if she wants to.

2681
03:26:51,633 --> 03:26:52,782
LAURA: Oh. Well, okay.

2682
03:26:52,782 --> 03:26:54,406
SAM: Are we going to text it to Ashley to read?

2683
03:26:54,406 --> 03:26:55,967
TRAVIS: She's getting it right now.

2684
03:26:55,967 --> 03:27:00,491
SAM: Okay, text it to Ashley. This is the speed of
internet.

2685
03:27:00,491 --> 03:27:02,847
LAURA: Ashley can read it out loud, if you want
to.

2686
03:27:02,847 --> 03:27:06,215
TALIESIN: Faster than a speeding Loot Crate.

2687
03:27:06,215 --> 03:27:18,247
ASHLEY: Not to be greedy, milady, but what's the
story with that ruby shield?

2688
03:27:18,247 --> 03:27:21,541
(laughter)

2689
03:27:21,541 --> 03:27:24,308
MATT: You start walking up wearing the armor you
just won and ask her this question?

2690
03:27:24,308 --> 03:27:31,229
ASHLEY: I feel like it matches. That's my only
reason I'm asking.

2691
03:27:31,229 --> 03:27:37,806
MATT: Both of her hands reach up over the desk,
because you can barely see her from your vantage

2692
03:27:37,806 --> 03:27:43,369
point, you're so small by comparison. Both of her
hands reach over, grasp the edge, and she leans

2693
03:27:43,369 --> 03:27:51,349
forward, looming over you, her large grinning dark
skin, vibrant red hair, braided, adorned with

2694
03:27:51,349 --> 03:28:04,014
jewels and metallic bands of platinum. She leans
down. "It is not for you to worry about. Now,

2695
03:28:04,014 --> 03:28:09,465
"leave me to my collection. You've already taken
one from me."

2696
03:28:09,465 --> 03:28:17,262
ASHLEY: Well, it wasn't taken from you. Okay,
thank you so much.

2697
03:28:17,262 --> 03:28:19,854
(laughter)

2698
03:28:19,854 --> 03:28:22,617
TRAVIS: You look awesome, Pike.

2699
03:28:22,617 --> 03:28:23,988
LAURA: You look amazing, Pike.

2700
03:28:23,988 --> 03:28:29,279
TRAVIS: Is it actually hotter in that armor? Are
you sweaty in there?

2701
03:28:29,279 --> 03:28:31,782
MATT: It's actually very comfortable and quite
cool.

2702
03:28:31,782 --> 03:28:34,692
SAM: Can you read what it says, Ashley?

2703
03:28:34,692 --> 03:28:37,872
LAURA: Is it quieter than her other mail?

2704
03:28:37,872 --> 03:28:39,061
MATT: No.

2705
03:28:39,061 --> 03:28:40,876
(laughter)

2706
03:28:40,876 --> 03:28:42,709
ASHLEY: It's still loud?

2707
03:28:42,709 --> 03:28:44,822
MATT: It's still pretty loud.

2708
03:28:44,822 --> 03:28:45,876
ASHLEY: Should I read it?

2709
03:28:45,876 --> 03:28:47,289
SAM: Yes, please, read it.

2710
03:28:47,289 --> 03:28:55,235
ASHLEY: Okay. Beautiful brass scrolling and
priceless cut rubies adorn this silver set of

2711
03:28:55,235 --> 03:29:02,770
armor. Worn by the high priest Duana of Pelor as
she fell in the battle of Ghor Dranas. While

2712
03:29:02,770 --> 03:29:06,547
wearing this armor, you gain a plus-three bonus to
AC?!

2713
03:29:06,547 --> 03:29:08,560
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not the best part.

2714
03:29:08,560 --> 03:29:10,151
TALIESIN: What? It gets better!

2715
03:29:10,151 --> 03:29:15,145
ASHLEY: You cannot be frightened, and you gain
resistance to fire damage, and when you are struck

2716
03:29:15,145 --> 03:29:20,791
by a melee attack, the attacker suffers 2d6 points
of fire damage!

2717
03:29:20,791 --> 03:29:25,061
TALIESIN: It gets better!

2718
03:29:25,061 --> 03:29:30,016
ASHLEY: If you are knocked unconscious by an
attack or spell, a blast of healing flame

2719
03:29:30,016 --> 03:29:37,069
surrounds you. You immediately regain five hit
points and are lifted to your feet! All harmful

2720
03:29:37,069 --> 03:29:44,560
creatures within 15 feet of you must make a
dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage,

2721
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:49,549
half damage on a success, and once you've used
this ability you cannot use it again until the

2722
03:29:49,549 --> 03:29:50,750
next dawn.

2723
03:29:50,750 --> 03:29:55,257
SAM: What?! So if someone kills her, they hurt
more.

2724
03:29:55,257 --> 03:29:58,778
LIAM: She bounces back from death one time a day.

2725
03:29:58,778 --> 03:30:00,460
MATT: From unconsciousness, yeah.

2726
03:30:00,460 --> 03:30:02,228
TALIESIN: Unconsciousness one time a day.

2727
03:30:02,228 --> 03:30:04,171
TRAVIS: If they hit her, they take damage.

2728
03:30:04,171 --> 03:30:06,762
LAURA: If she goes unconscious, they get blasted.

2729
03:30:06,762 --> 03:30:09,368
SAM: Holy shit.

2730
03:30:09,368 --> 03:30:11,700
TALIESIN: That's nuts.

2731
03:30:11,700 --> 03:30:15,416
ASHLEY: Oh man.

2732
03:30:15,416 --> 03:30:17,349
TRAVIS: That is amazing.

2733
03:30:17,349 --> 03:30:19,174
ASHLEY: What the heck.

2734
03:30:19,174 --> 03:30:20,974
MATT: It's a good Vestige.

2735
03:30:20,974 --> 03:30:23,089
MARISHA: That's amazing.

2736
03:30:23,089 --> 03:30:25,097
LAURA: Guys, we got all the Vestiges!

2737
03:30:25,097 --> 03:30:27,538
MARISHA: We got all of our legendary weapons.

2738
03:30:27,538 --> 03:30:29,551
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: That we know of.

2739
03:30:29,551 --> 03:30:33,967
SAM: What happens if we all put them together? Do
we become Voltron?

2740
03:30:33,967 --> 03:30:36,003
LAURA: Let's go home and do that.

2741
03:30:36,003 --> 03:30:37,507
MARISHA: Okay, let's go home.

2742
03:30:37,507 --> 03:30:40,141
SAM: Let's try to stack ourselves into some sort
of weird pyramid.

2743
03:30:40,141 --> 03:30:43,528
MATT: All right. So.

2744
03:30:43,528 --> 03:30:45,153
LAURA: Wait, are we going home or are we going--

2745
03:30:45,153 --> 03:30:46,881
MARISHA: To Fort Daxio?

2746
03:30:46,881 --> 03:30:48,238
LAURA: Or should we go home first?

2747
03:30:48,238 --> 03:30:49,140
TRAVIS: Daxio.

2748
03:30:49,140 --> 03:30:51,115
SAM: Do we need to check in with creepy guy?

2749
03:30:51,115 --> 03:30:52,396
MARISHA: We can come back for him.

2750
03:30:52,396 --> 03:30:53,856
SAM: Really? We don't need to check in?

2751
03:30:53,856 --> 03:30:57,275
MARISHA: I gave him a bracelet. He knows where we
are.

2752
03:30:57,275 --> 03:31:01,062
SAM: I don't want him coming for us. Don't we owe
him something?

2753
03:31:01,062 --> 03:31:03,010
LAURA: Yeah, but we can't take care of it right
now.

2754
03:31:03,010 --> 03:31:08,964
MARISHA: I gave him the bracelet so he knows where
to find us. As soon as we kill Thordak, we'll come

2755
03:31:08,964 --> 03:31:10,572
back and make good on our word.

2756
03:31:10,572 --> 03:31:14,211
LIAM: Yeah, if we survive, we'll send him a Jelly
of the Month club membership.

2757
03:31:14,211 --> 03:31:20,214
SAM: This does not seem like a good idea. If we
are in mid-Thordak battle and he shows up to

2758
03:31:20,214 --> 03:31:21,681
collect, we're fucked!

2759
03:31:21,681 --> 03:31:24,673
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'd button it up.

2760
03:31:24,673 --> 03:31:35,337
MARISHA: Well, if we go back, though, what if he
wants to cash in right now? I gave him the

2761
03:31:35,337 --> 03:31:37,049
bracelet. Deliberately.

2762
03:31:37,049 --> 03:31:42,770
TRAVIS: I don't think that meant we're going to
leave the Fire Plane before we settle the favor

2763
03:31:42,770 --> 03:31:46,410
that he <i>constantly</i> reminds that we owe him.

2764
03:31:46,410 --> 03:31:51,221
LIAM: Look, we didn't have the time to come here,
period, so let's go talk to him and ask him if we

2765
03:31:51,221 --> 03:31:54,043
can have a few days to get back to him. If we die,
problem solved.

2766
03:31:54,043 --> 03:31:56,521
LAURA: He'd make us owe him another fucking
favor.

2767
03:31:56,521 --> 03:31:59,869
TALIESIN: May I also recommend that we leave the
children out of that room?

2768
03:31:59,869 --> 03:32:04,110
MARISHA: Yeah, remember, we're dragging children
everywhere we go.

2769
03:32:04,110 --> 03:32:07,115
SAM: Can you send those children back?

2770
03:32:07,115 --> 03:32:08,784
TRAVIS: The mansion is still up, isn't it?

2771
03:32:08,784 --> 03:32:10,968
LAURA: No, but we'd have to walk all the fuck
back!

2772
03:32:10,968 --> 03:32:18,996
MARISHA: Look, he mentioned, "Let me give you a
trinket in case you all leave so I can find you again."

2773
03:32:18,996 --> 03:32:20,144
SAM: In case.

2774
03:32:20,144 --> 03:32:21,689
MARISHA: But he's expecting it.

2775
03:32:21,689 --> 03:32:26,884
TRAVIS: Yeah, but then we put it in his court when
he shows up. Favors.

2776
03:32:26,884 --> 03:32:31,570
ASHLEY: Is it a bad idea to just be like: We're
all done. We just got to go do a thing. You know

2777
03:32:31,570 --> 03:32:33,796
where we are. We'll be right back.

2778
03:32:33,796 --> 03:32:38,731
MARISHA: All right. I guess we can talk to him.
I'm just afraid he'll try and cash in on it right

2779
03:32:38,731 --> 03:32:40,192
now and not let us leave.

2780
03:32:40,192 --> 03:32:46,275
SAM: Then we'll settle this. We don't want Garth
from Wayne's World to have anything on our heads.

2781
03:32:46,275 --> 03:32:51,797
LIAM: Also, we're mostly nice people, but I'm
pretty sure Grog could crush him like an

2782
03:32:51,797 --> 03:32:58,319
accordion. We're not going to do that, but we can
set the terms of the favor a little bit.

2783
03:32:58,319 --> 03:33:00,676
LAURA: All right. Then let's fucking go!

2784
03:33:00,676 --> 03:33:02,028
TRAVIS: Let's go get Senokir.

2785
03:33:02,028 --> 03:33:03,192
LIAM: All right.

2786
03:33:03,192 --> 03:33:04,771
MARISHA: How far of a walk is it?

2787
03:33:04,771 --> 03:33:12,055
MATT: I'd say, with you guys not having a guide
and trying to go off memory in coasting through,

2788
03:33:12,055 --> 03:33:15,979
it'll take you a little over an hour, but you do
find it.

2789
03:33:15,979 --> 03:33:17,270
MARISHA: All right.

2790
03:33:17,270 --> 03:33:24,736
MATT: The establishment you now see from the other
side. There are three different types of languages

2791
03:33:24,736 --> 03:33:28,013
written above the top. One of them is Common; it
says "Flame Garden," and that is the name of his

2792
03:33:28,013 --> 03:33:37,666
jeweler's business. As you guys come to the front
doors, which are actually open for business, there

2793
03:33:37,666 --> 03:33:43,016
are no customers in there at the moment, and you
see Uten in the back is currently working on some

2794
03:33:43,016 --> 03:33:51,919
sort of a crafting circumstance, has a heavy
jeweler's visor-type setup with a number of

2795
03:33:51,919 --> 03:33:57,390
magnifying circular glasses set up, and is
currently grinding something small against a

2796
03:33:57,390 --> 03:34:01,619
piece. You see Senokir is off in the corner,
currently going through papers, and as you guys

2797
03:34:01,619 --> 03:34:14,216
step inside, he glances over. "So. Hello. It's
good to see you so soon. Can I help you?"

2798
03:34:14,216 --> 03:34:22,815
TALIESIN: We're about to head home, and we want to
make sure that you know that we have not forgotten

2799
03:34:22,815 --> 03:34:28,890
that we're indebted to you and that we plan, quite
possibly if it's amenable, about contracting you

2800
03:34:28,890 --> 03:34:32,170
for services in the future, as well, in your more
common field.

2801
03:34:32,170 --> 03:34:44,658
MATT: "That could very well be amenable. I am glad
you returned, for if you are on your way, this

2802
03:34:44,658 --> 03:34:54,064
"would be a good a time for me to ask for your
favor." He turns around and goes behind an area

2803
03:34:54,064 --> 03:34:58,281
and moves a couple of things around. You seem to
hear the clicking of something unlocking.

2804
03:34:58,281 --> 03:35:00,157
LAURA: If you want some autographs--

2805
03:35:00,157 --> 03:35:13,844
MATT: "No need. But you're sweet" And he pulls out
a small, dark box. It's about this big.

2806
03:35:13,844 --> 03:35:15,516
MARISHA: What's in the box?

2807
03:35:15,516 --> 03:35:17,642
(laughter)

2808
03:35:17,642 --> 03:35:28,159
MATT: "Here. I want you to take this and do me a
favor. This will consider our debt cleared, yes?"

2809
03:35:28,159 --> 03:35:30,440
TALIESIN and LAURA: What is it?

2810
03:35:30,440 --> 03:35:40,124
MATT: "This box contains the ashes of my late wife
Zaafin. I've kept them for years and had been

2811
03:35:40,124 --> 03:35:46,620
"intending to make a trip to Vasselheim and bury it
beneath the Birthheart in the Abundant Terrace

2812
03:35:46,620 --> 03:35:55,490
"where she once lived, toiled as a girl. I would
hope that you do this, and I will consider our

2813
03:35:55,490 --> 03:35:56,818
"pact complete."

2814
03:35:56,818 --> 03:36:01,412
SAM: That's it? What a nice, sweet man!

2815
03:36:01,412 --> 03:36:03,244
MARISHA: I think we misjudged him.

2816
03:36:03,244 --> 03:36:05,864
TRAVIS: It would be an honor.

2817
03:36:05,864 --> 03:36:08,676
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check?

2818
03:36:08,676 --> 03:36:11,340
MATT: (laughs) Sure, go ahead.

2819
03:36:11,340 --> 03:36:13,228
TALIESIN: It's not like it's going to help.

2820
03:36:13,228 --> 03:36:16,943
LAURA: Just to see. No, not a natural 20.

2821
03:36:16,943 --> 03:36:19,200
MATT: This is your night, Laura.

2822
03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:21,323
LAURA: This is not my night.

2823
03:36:21,323 --> 03:36:24,480
ASHLEY: Can I roll an insight check?

2824
03:36:24,480 --> 03:36:25,817
MATT: Sure.

2825
03:36:25,817 --> 03:36:27,514
TALIESIN: I like him.

2826
03:36:27,514 --> 03:36:30,730
TRAVIS: "Sure." Better be a 40 or higher.

2827
03:36:30,730 --> 03:36:32,866
ASHLEY: 18.

2828
03:36:32,866 --> 03:36:45,343
MATT: 18. He's hard to read. By his nature,
everything is even-keeled and strange. You can't

2829
03:36:45,343 --> 03:36:48,131
keep rolling insight until somebody gets a
ridiculous number!

2830
03:36:48,131 --> 03:36:49,599
TRAVIS: Well, <i>I</i> can, because it was a four.

2831
03:36:49,599 --> 03:36:50,886
MATT: Good. Great.

2832
03:36:50,886 --> 03:36:54,118
LAURA: Is this the size of the ashes, the box?

2833
03:36:54,118 --> 03:36:59,945
MATT: I'd say, it's about eight inches by eight
inches, and about maybe four inches high.

2834
03:36:59,945 --> 03:37:02,364
SAM: Matt, I just got a four insight check, as
well.

2835
03:37:02,364 --> 03:37:11,308
MATT: Okay, cool. You're all very confused. "Well,
I appreciate both meeting you all."

2836
03:37:11,308 --> 03:37:14,024
SAM: Where exactly would you like us to put
these?

2837
03:37:14,024 --> 03:37:15,501
TRAVIS: Vasselheim.

2838
03:37:15,501 --> 03:37:23,735
MATT: "The Birthheart. Bury it where the nature's
roots touches the soil. She'd like that."

2839
03:37:23,735 --> 03:37:27,943
TRAVIS: I do hate to pry, but how long ago did
your wife pass?

2840
03:37:27,943 --> 03:37:36,988
MATT: "This would have been four years, two
months, six days--"

2841
03:37:36,988 --> 03:37:41,030
ASHLEY: Why is it important to bury it there?

2842
03:37:41,030 --> 03:37:43,923
MATT: "It's where she grew up as a girl."

2843
03:37:43,923 --> 03:37:46,815
TRAVIS: You have our condolences.

2844
03:37:46,815 --> 03:37:49,532
LAURA: And a promise. It will be done.

2845
03:37:49,532 --> 03:37:51,236
MATT: "Good."

2846
03:37:51,236 --> 03:37:55,267
LIAM: Family and history are important.

2847
03:37:55,267 --> 03:37:56,546
MATT: "Indeed."

2848
03:37:56,546 --> 03:37:57,649
LAURA: Okay.

2849
03:37:57,649 --> 03:37:58,958
MATT: "Thank you."

2850
03:37:58,958 --> 03:38:00,380
TALIESIN: Let us be off, then.

2851
03:38:00,380 --> 03:38:09,833
MARISHA: If you ever find yourself in the Material
Plane and need a tour guide--

2852
03:38:09,833 --> 03:38:12,429
LAURA: Hey, Senokir, do you have any fire
potions?

2853
03:38:12,429 --> 03:38:15,447
MATT: "Hold on, I'm conversing. What were you
saying?"

2854
03:38:15,447 --> 03:38:21,395
MARISHA: Just, you know where to find us. I gave
you that bracelet.

2855
03:38:21,395 --> 03:38:25,116
MATT: "Yes, indeed."

2856
03:38:25,116 --> 03:38:27,510
TALIESIN: You'll most likely be hearing from us,
as well.

2857
03:38:27,510 --> 03:38:29,282
MATT: "Thank you."

2858
03:38:29,282 --> 03:38:32,509
LIAM: Wait. Percy?

2859
03:38:32,509 --> 03:38:35,290
TALIESIN: Yes. He does quite good work.

2860
03:38:35,290 --> 03:38:37,654
LIAM: Do you need a commission?

2861
03:38:37,654 --> 03:38:40,737
TALIESIN: I may have a thing. I'm giving it some
time.

2862
03:38:40,737 --> 03:38:45,174
LIAM: Time? It was just yesterday or two days ago
at the most that you said you needed it.

2863
03:38:45,174 --> 03:38:50,106
TALIESIN: I'm working on a commission. It's going
to be lovely. It's going to be a surprise.

2864
03:38:50,106 --> 03:38:52,610
TRAVIS: Not anymore. You're saying it in front of
all of us.

2865
03:38:52,610 --> 03:39:07,232
TALIESIN: All right, fine. If we survive this,
we're going to have killed five dragons, so what a

2866
03:39:07,232 --> 03:39:13,915
lovely thing it would be to have something built
from the scales of five dragons. We would be the

2867
03:39:13,915 --> 03:39:18,362
only people on the plane to be adorned with the
scales of five dragons.

2868
03:39:18,362 --> 03:39:23,098
SAM: Are you talking about fingerless gloves made
of dragonscale?

2869
03:39:23,098 --> 03:39:25,276
TALIESIN: Yes, that's exactly-- and Ray-Bans.

2870
03:39:25,276 --> 03:39:29,088
LIAM: Not what I was expecting, but I like it.

2871
03:39:29,088 --> 03:39:37,648
TALIESIN: I think if we survive this, I
think we all should be given something beautiful.

2872
03:39:37,648 --> 03:39:39,893
LAURA: Some emblem?

2873
03:39:39,893 --> 03:39:42,291
TALIESIN: Also, perhaps adorn the castle with a
few of them, as well.

2874
03:39:42,291 --> 03:39:46,252
LIAM: Well, this is a good place to start. This is
above average here. It's a whole other dimension.

2875
03:39:46,252 --> 03:39:49,553
TALIESIN: I love his work. We'll be in touch.

2876
03:39:49,553 --> 03:39:51,127
MATT: "Very good."

2877
03:39:51,127 --> 03:39:55,764
MARISHA: We have your card. We're good. Yeah, we
know.

2878
03:39:55,764 --> 03:39:57,576
MATT: "All right. Well, I'll be here."

2879
03:39:57,576 --> 03:40:05,772
ASHLEY: Oh, what was your wife's name? Do you want
us to put a marker there or anything like that?

2880
03:40:05,772 --> 03:40:07,130
MATT: "Zaafin."

2881
03:40:07,130 --> 03:40:08,939
SAM: Zaafin?

2882
03:40:08,939 --> 03:40:11,665
LAURA: Got it.

2883
03:40:11,665 --> 03:40:17,730
LIAM: As one last thank you to him, since I'm
still invisible, I make moose antlers behind my

2884
03:40:17,730 --> 03:40:19,253
sister's head and go--

2885
03:40:19,253 --> 03:40:23,831
MATT: (quiet laughter)

2886
03:40:23,831 --> 03:40:26,599
TRAVIS: That's what I wanted. One last laugh.

2887
03:40:26,599 --> 03:40:30,627
MATT: "Thank you so much. Stay safe."

2888
03:40:30,627 --> 03:40:32,901
LAURA: Thank you, Senokir.

2889
03:40:32,901 --> 03:40:37,054
(laughter)

2890
03:40:37,054 --> 03:40:39,332
MATT: He turns around and goes back to his paper.

2891
03:40:39,332 --> 03:40:45,415
MARISHA: Wait, Senokir, before you do that, is it
safe for us to teleport out of here? You won't mind?

2892
03:40:45,415 --> 03:40:47,622
MATT: He's just going through his papers, not
paying attention.

2893
03:40:47,622 --> 03:40:48,825
MARISHA: Okay.

2894
03:40:48,825 --> 03:40:50,220
TRAVIS: Yeah, just do it.

2895
03:40:50,220 --> 03:40:51,367
MARISHA: Let's go.

2896
03:40:51,367 --> 03:40:53,090
MATT: All right, where are you guys going?

2897
03:40:53,090 --> 03:40:56,834
MARISHA: Fort Daxio? Yeah. We all join hands with
the kids.

2898
03:40:56,834 --> 03:40:58,382
SAM: Oh yeah, the kids.

2899
03:40:58,382 --> 03:41:02,094
LAURA: Oh, I bamf Trinket back in my necklace so
that we have enough.

2900
03:41:02,094 --> 03:41:03,689
MARISHA: It's one big fatty spell.

2901
03:41:03,689 --> 03:41:04,978
SAM: Nine? Okay.

2902
03:41:04,978 --> 03:41:09,318
MARISHA: Me and eight. So let's go! (teleporting
sounds)

2903
03:41:09,318 --> 03:41:15,570
MATT: All righty. You all concentrate, focus
yourselves, clasping your hands together,

2904
03:41:15,570 --> 03:41:21,783
concentrating on the Prime Material Plane.
Keyleth, with the memory of Fort Daxio before you,

2905
03:41:21,783 --> 03:41:29,650
you grab out your tuning fork component, your
focus that you use for the spells to consider the

2906
03:41:29,650 --> 03:41:35,346
plane. You find yourselves suddenly shift once
more, the air almost escaping your lungs as that

2907
03:41:35,346 --> 03:41:41,083
cold sensation grasps your torso and you feel like
you're being thrust through a doorway. Suddenly,

2908
03:41:41,083 --> 03:41:46,986
it comes back and the warmth hits you once again
of the sunlight. You open your eyes, and you're

2909
03:41:46,986 --> 03:41:58,247
standing in the Othendin Pass once more. Though
not as you left it. There are billowing clouds of

2910
03:41:58,247 --> 03:42:05,363
black in the air around you. You hear the shouts
in the distance as the fort itself is currently

2911
03:42:05,363 --> 03:42:11,753
under siege. You see what appears to be dozens of
flying creatures currently swooping in and

2912
03:42:11,753 --> 03:42:16,212
attacking. Most of the landscape here has been
recently charred or burned. The bits of scrubland

2913
03:42:16,212 --> 03:42:19,343
that you see have been burned to small ashy
cinders.

2914
03:42:19,343 --> 03:42:27,054
Fort Daxio is in the process of falling. And
that's where we're going to go ahead and pick up

2915
03:42:27,054 --> 03:42:28,823
next Thursday.

2916
03:42:28,823 --> 03:42:33,905
SAM and LAURA: Consequences.

2917
03:42:33,905 --> 03:42:35,755
LIAM: And cows.

2918
03:42:35,755 --> 03:42:38,454
SAM and TALIESIN: Consequences and cows.

2919
03:42:38,454 --> 03:42:41,571
LAURA: Man, maybe we shouldn't have gone back to
Senokir.

2920
03:42:41,571 --> 03:42:48,237
MARISHA: How long were we gone? Do you have any
rough estimate?

2921
03:42:48,237 --> 03:42:49,878
TRAVIS: How long was I gone?

2922
03:42:49,878 --> 03:42:51,961
MARISHA: How long was I out for, man?

2923
03:42:51,961 --> 03:42:56,294
MATT: With the full rest you took to prepare for
your encounter with the pit fiend and the

2924
03:42:56,294 --> 03:43:01,892
travelling to and from, probably close to two
days. Anyway, we'll pick that up next week.

2925
03:43:01,892 --> 03:43:03,741
LIAM: Two weeks from now.

2926
03:43:03,741 --> 03:43:06,214
MATT: Oh, two weeks. Yeah, that's right. Two weeks
from now, because Thanksgiving.

2927
03:43:06,214 --> 03:43:08,103
MARISHA: Oh god, yeah.

2928
03:43:08,103 --> 03:43:12,130
MATT: Congrats on getting all your known Vestiges,
guys!

2929
03:43:12,130 --> 03:43:15,890
LIAM: Let's all be thankful for Vestiges and
thankful for being alive.

2930
03:43:15,890 --> 03:43:17,516
ASHLEY: We have all the Vestiges!

2931
03:43:17,516 --> 03:43:19,368
LAURA: And we're not dead.

2932
03:43:19,368 --> 03:43:25,106
SAM: Daxio really needed a restart anyway. We can
plan our attack from somewhere else.

2933
03:43:25,106 --> 03:43:27,468
MARISHA: How many people did we gather?

2934
03:43:27,468 --> 03:43:31,053
MATT: You sent out and notified a number of
individuals.

2935
03:43:31,053 --> 03:43:33,458
LAURA: But it's only been a day and a half, so
nobody has got here yet.

2936
03:43:33,458 --> 03:43:40,177
MARISHA: I hope so. I hope we didn't put all of
our eggs in one basket and then burn the omelet. Yeah.

2937
03:43:40,177 --> 03:43:44,023
SAM: Hey, guys, we're here to save your fort.
We're going to just step away for two days.

2938
03:43:44,023 --> 03:43:47,524
(laughter)

2939
03:43:47,524 --> 03:43:49,050
SAM: Bye!

2940
03:43:49,050 --> 03:43:50,609
MATT: True Vox Machina.

2941
03:43:50,609 --> 03:43:53,154
LIAM: You're going to do great.

2942
03:43:53,154 --> 03:43:55,044
MARISHA: Thanks for coming!

2943
03:43:55,044 --> 03:43:57,301
MARISHA, SAM, and TRAVIS: Bye!

2944
03:43:57,301 --> 03:44:04,176
MATT: Regardless, guys, great job tonight. We'll
see you guys back here in a couple weeks. Some of

2945
03:44:04,176 --> 03:44:11,780
us will be here next Tuesday for Talks Machina.
It's here on Twitch and Alpha. Yeah.

2946
03:44:11,780 --> 03:44:13,603
TALIESIN: Playlist on Friday.

2947
03:44:13,603 --> 03:44:15,543
MATT: Yeah, playlist on Friday, tomorrow, from
Keyleth.

2948
03:44:15,543 --> 03:44:20,157
LAURA: Is the next playlist still going to go up
the day after Thanksgiving, or is that going to be

2949
03:44:20,157 --> 03:44:21,552
two weeks from now?

2950
03:44:21,552 --> 03:44:22,933
SAM: Well, one's going up tomorrow.

2951
03:44:22,933 --> 03:44:28,306
LIAM: I think we should go ahead and do it. Give
them something to tide them over.

2952
03:44:28,306 --> 03:44:31,905
TRAVIS and LAURA: (singing) Let's give them
something to talk about!

2953
03:44:31,905 --> 03:44:35,480
SAM: We're also doing a Thanksgiving costume
contest.

2954
03:44:35,480 --> 03:44:37,624
(laughter)

2955
03:44:37,624 --> 03:44:42,718
LAURA: Oh, and those winners, those are going out
this weekend to the winners, just so you guys know.

2956
03:44:42,718 --> 03:44:48,392
MATT: All the costume winners, you'll be getting
your stuff soon. Thank you guys so much. Much

2957
03:44:48,392 --> 03:44:55,858
love, and is it Thursday after next Thursday yet?
Happy Thanksgiving, guys!

2958
03:44:55,858 --> 03:52:03,172
