1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
MATT: Welcome, everyone, to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,339
actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. My
name is Matthew Mercer, I'm the Dungeon Master.

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:12,906
For those who are returning, good to see you
again, and for those for the first time, welcome,

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:19,056
and hopefully you're not too lost. So, Sam is on
his way right now, being in the usual traffic from

5
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:25,998
wherever he comes from, being a professional.
Having a career that's functional and perpetually

6
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:33,229
busy. Get here soon, Sam! Quickly, please! Drive
safe. Don't drive with children in the street.

7
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:37,069
Apparently, that was confusion from last time.
People thought that he was actually driving in

8
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:42,442
children. Like, he had problems with children and
traffic, and thought children in traffic. So, keep

9
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,028
your children out of traffic, if you don't mind.
That's a general Critical Role request.

10
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:47,056
MARISHA: PSA.

11
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:55,114
MATT: PSA, yeah. Before we get started in this,
first and foremost, I want to say hello to our

12
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,174
guest for the evening, Mr. Chris Hardwick.

13
00:00:57,174 --> 00:00:59,086
(cheering)

14
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:00,846
CHRIS: Good to be here.

15
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:03,006
MATT: Glad you could join us for tonight's game.

16
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:06,952
CHRIS: Also very excited to be here on Ravenclaw
Appreciation Day: the best house, of course.

17
00:01:06,952 --> 00:01:08,170
MARISHA: Yes, that's true.

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,694
CHRIS: Wit beyond measure is man's greatest
treasure.

19
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,743
LAURA: Hufflepuff!

20
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:11,725
CHRIS: Well...

21
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,168
TALIESIN: Slytherin. Slytherin. Ravenclaw's pretty
good. Pretty good.

22
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,441
CHRIS: If by good, you mean the best.

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:17,759
MATT: There you go.

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,538
CHRIS: I'm sorry, there's no--

25
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,743
SAM: Oh, shit! This is so awkward.

26
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,075
TALIESIN: I thought we called you.

27
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,874
CHRIS: Can you stand near the bear?

28
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:31,784
LAURA: His name is Trinket, all right?

29
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:34,876
SAM: Is this how I was fired from the show?

30
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:39,681
CHRIS: We thought we would do it on the livestream
just to really help capture the traffic that that

31
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:40,845
would bring.

32
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:44,534
SAM: Good luck. I think you're going to do great.
These guys will take care of you.

33
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:47,671
CHRIS: I've been working with this guy for the
last couple of years on Sanjay &amp; Craig. He gets

34
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:53,596
all businessy, he's a responsible adult in the
workplace.

35
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:55,323
MATT: And then he comes here.

36
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,160
SAM: And then I come here. You're not, you're the
same.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,964
CHRIS: I can't wait to see this other side.

38
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:01,436
SAM: Where am I supposed to sit?! Right here?

39
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:03,912
MATT: Right there, yeah. Just scoot in.

40
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:06,693
SAM: Is that true? I don't know. Are we scooting
over?

41
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,014
CHRIS: I would move over, but I need both. My
legs are--

42
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,090
SAM: This is the most awkward.

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,799
TALIESIN: It's like a New York subway over here.

44
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:21,663
CHRIS: Can you just rappel down that?

45
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:24,104
MATT: There we go.

46
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,816
LAURA: This is so awkward.

47
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:29,660
SAM: I love it. No, no, I've got the half-table at
the end here. It's great.

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,405
CHRIS: Matt, I don't like having people on my
right side. Is this weird?

49
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,823
MATT: If becomes a problem, just raise your hand
and scream.

50
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,858
CHRIS: It's already a problem.

51
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,571
MATT: Oh, damn it!

52
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:45,261
MARISHA: I'm technically at the end. This is on
Chris, really.

53
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,977
LIAM: Can you scoot the whole bench down on this
side?

54
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:49,675
LAURA: Yeah, scoot the bench down. Look at how far
the bench is on our side.

55
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:52,937
TRAVIS: Put the leg of the table between here.

56
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:59,357
MATT: Very well-oiled machine, Critical Role.

57
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:02,590
LAURA: Thanks for joining us this week.

58
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,064
MATT: The utmost of presentory quality we promise
to you on a weekly basis. Thank you for joining

59
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:12,469
us. All right, so.

60
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:16,472
TRAVIS: Lock it up, right table, Jesus!

61
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:18,112
SAM: Sorry, we're ready.

62
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:23,644
MATT: Welcome, Sam, glad you could make it. Let's
get through our announcements quickly for the

63
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:30,620
week. Tomorrow, a bunch of us are going to be at
Wondercon down at the LA Convention Center. Not

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,209
Anaheim. It's always been at Anaheim, and I
thought it was Anaheim when I mentioned it last

65
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,525
week. But, no, it's in LA because everything likes
to prove me wrong. We'll be there. 7:00-8:00pm is

66
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:42,806
our Critical Role panel, so if you're in the area,
you're coming to the event, come say hello, bring

67
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:48,271
questions, preferably not punch me in the face for
getting it wrong with Anaheim.

68
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,880
CHRIS: It used to be in San Francisco.

69
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,215
MATT: Even before that!

70
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:57,196
CHRIS: Yeah! I went to it at Moscone Center like
six or seven years ago, and then Anaheim. It's

71
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,383
getting closer and closer.

72
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,519
MARISHA: Yeah, it's going to be in Lancaster next
year.

73
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,616
TALIESIN: And the year after, it's going to be at
my house. It'll be great.

74
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:08,407
MATT: We will go there for that. Going to
Lancaster for anything is a difficult choice.

75
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:09,904
Sorry, Lancaster!

76
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:12,227
LAURA: Longest announcements <i>ever</i>!

77
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:17,531
MATT: I know! We have, tonight--

78
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,041
MARISHA: Shirts!

79
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:25,599
MATT: I'm getting to it! We had an issue last week
where a bunch of our Gilmore shirts sold out

80
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,028
really quickly.

81
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:28,347
SAM: This shirt, right here?

82
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:30,482
MATT: That shirt that you're wearing, the
Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

83
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:32,516
LAURA: The one that everybody wants, but nobody
can have.

84
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:33,818
SAM: I have it!

85
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,219
MATT: That's terrible.

86
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:36,295
SAM: Oh, sorry.

87
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:37,795
CHRIS: Do I have to sit next to him?

88
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,003
TRAVIS: The whole time.

89
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,927
SAM: Don't worry, I've already been emasculated.

90
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,478
(laughter)

91
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:51,680
MATT: We're counting it as community service,
it'll be fine. However, in trying to make sure

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,810
that we can help our folks who don't get to see it
live have an opportunity at these, we're going to

93
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,482
be starting for a week a limited pre-order for
Gilmore shirts. Should be up live now on the

94
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:03,285
website. So if you didn't have the opportunity to
go ahead and grab your own Gilmore's Glorious

95
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:07,816
Goods shirt, go to GeekandSundry.com right now, go
to their store, it should be available for

96
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,518
pre-orders for the next week.

97
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,477
LIAM: Grab this unicorn by the horn.

98
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:19,408
MATT: Yes. Yes. Grog-- Travis, but Grog. You're
wearing a delightful shirt, there. Would you like

99
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,082
to tell us a bit about that shirt?

100
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,896
TRAVIS: This is the next of our shirt designs--

101
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:24,148
SAM: Oh, is that true?

102
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:28,795
TRAVIS: -- the Strongjaw Ale shirt design, which
will be on sale tomorrow at our Wondercon panel

103
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,096
and the Geek and Sundry store as well.

104
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,384
LIAM: That is manly.

105
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:34,592
TRAVIS: Aged six months in a Bag of Holding.

106
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,704
(laughter)

107
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,081
LAURA: You can read?

108
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,729
TRAVIS: Upside-down only.

109
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,126
MATT: Makes sense. Anyone else have any
announcements they want to bring up?

110
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:50,525
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can now be your companion, as of
this week, in Fallout 4, if you build a robot and

111
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:53,654
give it the male voice, I can be really polite to
you for hours on end.

112
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,425
LAURA and MATT: Yay!

113
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:59,540
TALIESIN: You can have me be very polite. That's
the only way you can have me be very polite.

114
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,832
MATT: You can make him very polite, and
apparently be sexy Codsworth, which is the new

115
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:05,058
internet thing. It's the Codsworth top with the
normal legs at the bottom, and it's just sexy

116
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:08,158
running Codsworth, with Taliesin's voice. So do
that.

117
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:09,501
TALIESIN: That horrifies me.

118
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,265
CHRIS: May I promote just a quick thing?

119
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:12,373
MATT: Of course, please!

120
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,128
CHRIS: We're doing the Nerdist panel Sunday at
Wondercon, and then I'm going to do a signing

121
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:19,336
right afterwards, I think 11 and 12 are the two
times for that, and then, if you have a chance, I

122
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:24,917
just posted on Facebook the full, unedited
episode. We did a Trump v. Sanders debate on

123
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,411
@Midnight last night, and it was really fun.

124
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,600
MATT: It's awesome.

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,207
CHRIS: And they extended it to an hour because it
was so much fun, so it's on Facebook now, and just

126
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,945
go and share it, please, because we enjoyed making
it.

127
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,363
MATT: It's awesome, seriously.

128
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,477
CHRIS: Thank you very much.

129
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:42,165
MATT: Of course, of course, yeah, check that one
out. I caught that earlier today, haphazardly, and

130
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,584
I'm glad I did. And you'll be glad too.

131
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,649
MARISHA: Did it trend on Twitter? That's where I
saw it.

132
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,732
CHRIS: It did, yeah, last night it did and then we
stuck it up today. And then a comedy special on

133
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:53,521
Comedy Central, Funcomfortable, April 30th.

134
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:56,017
MATT: April 30th. Heck yeah, man, congrats.

135
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:57,564
(cheering)

136
00:06:57,564 --> 00:07:00,890
MATT: That'll be awesome. All righty.

137
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:07,547
LIAM: Oh my gosh, 'critrole' is the code you need
for free shipping if you want Wyrmwood Gaming

138
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:12,150
boxes to hold your dice in them. We all have them.
I have some at home. My kids love them. Critrole

139
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,965
is the code you need for free shipping.

140
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:16,452
TRAVIS: (belches)

141
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,846
CHRIS: I expected a bassier belch.

142
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:22,982
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, it comes from her, though,
she's like a howitzer, it's a whole other thing.

143
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:25,285
LAURA: Yeah. I'll surprise you with it, don't
worry.

144
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:27,925
TRAVIS: It'll make your shirt move, it's legit.

145
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,563
MATT: No, like, she'll actually surprise you,
she'll wait until you're walking through a parking

146
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:33,664
garage at two am and just over your shoulder
(belches).

147
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:35,059
TRAVIS: Telephone rings. Hello? (belches)

148
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:39,860
MATT: Exactly. She's good. Anyone have anything
else they want to announce before we jump into the

149
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,949
game?

150
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,872
SAM: I'm sitting on half a chair.

151
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,557
MATT: Thank you for that, Sam.

152
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:45,757
CHRIS: Scoot a cheek here.

153
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,444
SAM: No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

154
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:49,044
LAURA: He's not fine.

155
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:51,216
CHRIS: It was important enough for you to bring it
up, Sam.

156
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,679
SAM: I'm fine, Christopher.

157
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:57,218
LIAM: His character is small, but he has a big
personality.

158
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:01,390
CHRIS: How do you do this every week?

159
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,134
MATT: That's a good, good question.

160
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,805
TALIESIN: Normally sedated.

161
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:11,981
MATT: All righty. So. Let's go ahead and jump into
this wondrous--

162
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,693
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

163
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:20,583
MATT: So, to get you guys a little bit up to speed
with some of the fun that's happened previously on

164
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:28,123
Critical Role, our band of intrepid adventurers,
Vox Machina, after having a horrible encounter

165
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:33,458
with the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of chromatic
evil dragons that has just torn through the

166
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:41,013
Tal'Dorei countryside, destroying cityscape after
cityscape, the party has fled and has been seeking

167
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:46,199
information on how to possibly eventually topple
these creatures and restore order to the land of

168
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:51,051
Tal'Dorei. They began seeking these artifacts
known as the Vestiges of Divergence that promise

169
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:56,427
ancient power from wars long past that could aid
them in this journey. After acquiring one, with a

170
00:08:56,427 --> 00:09:01,605
near-death experience by Vex'ahlia over there,
they began their next step in the journey.

171
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:06,544
However, as part of a recent scrying spell by
Keyleth, the druid, they discovered that the Pyrah

172
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:14,686
tribe of her druidic heritage, the Ashari, were
decimated as their home of Pyrah was the portal to

173
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:20,127
the fire elemental plane that they normally guard,
was where Thordak the Cinder King, the great red

174
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:26,546
dragon, tore through into this prime realm and
managed to seemingly wipe out most if not all of

175
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:35,177
the tribe. Vox Machina made the relatively grim
journey back to the mountainside, finding it now

176
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:41,628
brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity
that previously lay dormant. Upon climbing the

177
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:47,426
side of the mountain, you found remnants of the
Pyrah tribe still alive, and making their way up

178
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:52,535
the mountain, as damaged as they are, in hopes
of sealing this now progressively swelling tear

179
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:58,139
between the prime material plane and the elemental
plane of fire. Not just that, there was aid that

180
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:04,789
came to the Pyrah tribe. And it involved a number
of Air Ashari, one of which was Korren, Keyleth's

181
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:11,155
father. There was a brief, tearful exchange and
reunion before the rest of you, steeling

182
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:17,017
yourselves, began to walk in towards the center of
the mountain's caldera, towards the remnants of

183
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:22,282
the Cindergrove, the now-destroyed and sundered
petrified forest, in hopes of closing this

184
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:32,376
rippling tear to the elemental plane once and for
all. And this is where we begin. So. The group of

185
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:41,036
the six of you, gathering alongside the dozen or
so Pyrah members, with various burns, Cerkonos,

186
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:47,602
who is the leader of the tribe, now missing his
arm, cauterized at the shoulder, all advancing

187
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:54,933
forward quietly in this tense push of necessity.
You can see in the distance, swirling between the

188
00:10:54,933 --> 00:11:01,710
trees, clusters of glowing elemental entities that
are either spilling forth from this recently and

189
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,917
have taken this landscape as their own, or are
just enjoying in their-- elementals like to burn

190
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:15,067
shit. And so you're seeing fire elementals wandering
about, just tearing through what remains of this

191
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:23,504
countryside, and let's see, you actually,
Vex'ahlia-- as you guys are stepping forward,

192
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:28,901
keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities,
these creatures, you catch out of the corner of

193
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:34,917
your eye what appears to be a number of other
humanoids, a small cluster of shadowed individuals

194
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:38,549
far off to the left, tucked around the bottom of a
tree.

195
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:43,058
LAURA: I ask everyone to wait. Percy.

196
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:44,100
TALIESIN: Yes?

197
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,308
LAURA: Can you look through your scope and see who
that is?

198
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:49,251
TALIESIN: I'll take a look.

199
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,173
MATT: Make a perception check.

200
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:52,880
SAM: First roll.

201
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
TALIESIN: Ooh. That's not bad.

202
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,035
(eerie music)

203
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:56,940
LAURA: The music.

204
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,169
LIAM: The violins go south.

205
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,329
TALIESIN: 23.

206
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:05,527
MATT: 23. Glancing over in that direction, you
see, towards one of the larger, broken petrified

207
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:12,195
trees, right on the outskirts of the Cindergrove
forest, you see what appear to be a cluster of

208
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:20,502
humanoids. Two of them have flesh. The other two
do not. These skeletal creatures shuffle in place,

209
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:26,197
clutching a blade to one side, while the other two
appear to be in partially rotted states. They're

210
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:35,987
mostly disinterested in their surroundings and
stand there, head to the side, aimless--

211
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:43,096
TALIESIN: Are they in the clothing of the natives,
or do they not look to be Ashari?

212
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:50,663
MATT: From what you can tell, one of them does
appear to have Ashari wardrobe. The other one does not.

213
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:54,424
TRAVIS: -- he said in a weird way.

214
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:57,104
TALIESIN: They look undead. Doesn't--

215
00:12:57,104 --> 00:13:01,028
LAURA: Are they from here?

216
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:10,994
TALIESIN: Possibly. One looks vaguely familiar,
but there's something wrong. We should proceed--

217
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:16,298
let's go up and find out what's happening. Slowly,
and armed.

218
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:22,828
MATT: At this point, Korren, Keyleth's father and
the head of the Air Ashari in your absence, puts

219
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:29,798
his hand forth and goes, "I'm sorry, you're saying
that you see along the way undead creatures."

220
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:37,133
TALIESIN: Yes. There's something unnatural over in
that direction. We should probably be the ones to

221
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,784
investigate.

222
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:44,310
MATT: "All right. Given the nature of the
elemental presence here, we're going to have to

223
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,110
"probably divide and attack the central place from
multiple positions, otherwise they're going to

224
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:55,305
"have too strong of a fire-front at the edges of
this border. Do you feel confident enough to

225
00:13:55,305 --> 00:13:57,853
"handle your own sliver of this assault?"

226
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,727
TRAVIS: (scoffs and laughs) Is he serious?

227
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:05,225
MARISHA: Grog. I believe we can handle it.

228
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:09,223
LAURA: We don't have a lot of magic wielders with
us, though.

229
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,862
MATT: "That's all right--"

230
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:12,639
SAM: (clears throat) I'm pretty good.

231
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,171
LAURA: A lot of magic wielders.

232
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,706
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're better than good, buddy.

233
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:18,390
TALIESIN: You're okay.

234
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:24,323
MATT: "Well, we'll keep an eye out. We'll have two
of our druids overhead, keeping eyesight. If

235
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:29,108
"anything goes wrong, signal up there. You know
how, Keyleth. And we'll send them down to aid you.

236
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,211
"All right."

237
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,428
LAURA: Sounds good.

238
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:37,287
MATT: "The air Ashari will come from the
northeast. Cerkonos, take the rest of your tribe,

239
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:47,759
"head from the west. You, continue on forward. If
this troupe you've found of seemingly lifeless

240
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:54,007
"entities looks even remotely dangerous, do not
engage. They are not our target. But if this is a

241
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:59,828
"scourge that has spread into the Cindergrove, I
fear we may be in worse shape than I had

242
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:08,201
"originally envisioned. Regardless, stay silent,
stay swift." He looks back to the rest of the Air

243
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:13,248
Ashari, and all of them, their outer form shimmers
as the wind begins to collect around their feet,

244
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:19,823
ever so quietly, and they all with an intense
speed begin to trek at an incredible pace,

245
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:24,201
seemingly blending in with the rock surroundings
as they go, disappearing around one side of the

246
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:29,316
Cindergrove forest. Cerkonos and the others nod.
Cerkonos looks to the rest of you, brings up his

247
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:34,600
one hand and gives a touch to the top of his chest
and sternum and bows his head and goes, "I wish

248
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:43,161
"you all great luck. See you on the inside." And
the rest of the fire Ashari turn into burning fire

249
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:48,901
elemental forms and begin to streak through the
various broken rocks and pieces of glass-shattered

250
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:55,815
obsidian that peppered this landscape in the
caldera, leaving the six of you ready to trek

251
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:57,306
forward yourself.

252
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,664
TRAVIS: Scanlan, can you do that?

253
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:02,350
SAM: Ah, no. No, and I don't think I could learn.

254
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,482
TRAVIS: Oh.

255
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:05,759
LAURA: Perfect. So.

256
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,109
MARISHA: Let's go.

257
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:08,137
LAURA: Avoid the skeletons?

258
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:09,444
MARISHA: Avoid the skeletons.

259
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,658
TALIESIN: Let's take a look, at least.

260
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:12,653
MARISHA: What?

261
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:15,697
TALIESIN: We're supposed to make sure they're not
part of something larger that's heading in--

262
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:16,796
LAURA: They're in the way, Keyleth.

263
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:18,604
MARISHA: Did you not just hear my father--

264
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:22,419
TALIESIN: He said if they don't bother us, to
leave them alone, but that we should just check to

265
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,961
make sure that they're not part of something.

266
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,777
LAURA: Are they in the path at all, do they look
like they're going to be near us when we go?

267
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:33,224
MATT: They look like, wherever you're traveling--
because there's an open expanse of about 80 or so

268
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:36,988
feet before you actually reach the edge of the
Cindergrove, and they're right on the outskirts of

269
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:41,817
the Cindergrove forest, so lest you're very
careful, they would technically see you if they're

270
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:42,860
paying attention.

271
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,907
TRAVIS: Yes!

272
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,922
TALIESIN: Tread gently and see if they react.

273
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,119
MARISHA: Do you have Pass Without a Trace, Vex?

274
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:53,968
LAURA: I do. But, Keyleth, the minute we start
fighting, they will notice us, and then they'll

275
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:55,383
attack us from behind.

276
00:16:55,383 --> 00:17:00,239
TALIESIN: So it would be best to get their
attention now when everything's quiet.

277
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:07,264
MARISHA: We also don't want to waste all of our
abilities on undead.

278
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:11,508
TALIESIN: There's only two, maybe four of them.

279
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,110
MATT: There's four of them.

280
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,741
LIAM: That we see.

281
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:20,909
MARISHA: Why don't we just tread that way, and
we'll see what happens.

282
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,620
TALIESIN: That's exactly what we're saying.

283
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,983
SAM: What could happen?

284
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,458
LAURA: I guess I use Pass Without a Trace on all
of us.

285
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,701
TALIESIN: You did.

286
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,201
MARISHA: Did we already have it?

287
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:31,898
LAURA: Did we already have it? From last time?

288
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:35,007
MATT: As long as you're maintaining your
concentration, how long does it last for?

289
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,348
Concentration? I believe it--

290
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,396
LAURA: It holds for up to an hour.

291
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:41,512
MATT: An hour, yeah, so you can still be under
that effect.

292
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,656
LAURA: Sweet.

293
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,005
MATT: So I would like all six of you to roll
stealth checks for me, if you could.

294
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,400
TRAVIS: With triple advantage?

295
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,188
MATT: No. Just the plus ten. Which is better than
advantage.

296
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:52,413
MARISHA: Triple advantage.

297
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:53,608
TRAVIS: 25.

298
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:54,795
TALIESIN: 30.

299
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,786
MARISHA: 28.

300
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:57,853
LIAM: 38.

301
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:58,671
LAURA: 30.

302
00:17:58,671 --> 00:17:59,836
MATT: 38--

303
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,030
SAM: 14.

304
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,743
(laughter)

305
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:03,590
MATT: With plus ten?

306
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,752
SAM: With the plus ten.

307
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:05,631
MATT: All right.

308
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,777
TRAVIS: Incredible.

309
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:11,998
SAM: Tra-la-la-la-la.

310
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:22,726
MATT: So as the entire group bends down into a
ninja-like stance, just darting across as fast as

311
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:27,450
they can, keeping low to the ground and using much
of the shadow of the overhead clouds and smoke

312
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:35,690
that has completely engulfed the above skyscape,
behind you, bounding very loudly, is a gentle

313
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,598
gnome, swishing brown hair--

314
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:39,770
SAM: I'm trying to do that thing that the Ashari
just did.

315
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,572
MATT: Right. It's not working.

316
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:43,490
LIAM: Hot, hot, hot.

317
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:51,359
MATT: And as you're darting across, you're jumping
over little open globules of molten lava that is

318
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:57,316
starting to pour out from various crevices in the
stone floor, you try to hop around to avoid that,

319
00:18:57,316 --> 00:19:03,323
and in doing so, your foot catches the edge of a
piece of stone, and you begin to go into a tumble.

320
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:04,697
Make an acrobatics check.

321
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:10,262
SAM: Oh, yes. Mm-hm. Oh, disadvantage, because I'm
exhausted.

322
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,375
MATT: You are.

323
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,060
LAURA: Oh, shit. I forgot about that.

324
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,205
LIAM: The honest gnome.

325
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:18,923
SAM: Okay. 14.

326
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:25,192
MATT: (laughs) You do manage to catch yourself,
with a slight tumble, skid a bit on your ass, and

327
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:28,342
land on your feet. It would've been a cool
three-point landing if anyone else had attempted

328
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:33,882
it, but you just barely catch yourself, look back
at the group with a sheepish grin, and out of the

329
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:40,251
corner of your eye, you see one of the undead entities
turn its head and look right in your direction.

330
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:41,363
LAURA: (whispering) Good job, Scanlan.

331
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:42,681
SAM: (whispering) I think it saw Grog.

332
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,963
TRAVIS: Sorry.

333
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:47,153
MATT: It starts wandering in your direction.

334
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,716
SAM: Should we engage or keep going?

335
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:54,257
MARISHA: I'm afraid if we engage, it could draw
attention to an entire slew of what could be

336
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:55,266
around.

337
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,333
TALIESIN: Let's just put it down quietly.

338
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,176
MARISHA: All right, Jesus Christ.

339
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,366
TALIESIN: No magic.

340
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,653
LAURA: No.

341
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:02,791
TALIESIN: Just weapons.

342
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,797
LAURA: No guns.

343
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:06,108
TALIESIN: No guns. I pull my sword.

344
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:09,562
MARISHA: Vex, you might be the most capable of
this.

345
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:10,909
LAURA: I shoot it with an arrow.

346
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,092
MATT: All right, roll for an attack.

347
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:15,789
LAURA: Okay. Just going for it. Okay.

348
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:16,709
TRAVIS: Wow.

349
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:22,134
LAURA: I'm literally, I think I cursed myself
sometime between here and San Francisco.

350
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:25,838
TALIESIN: The d20s talk to each other and they
know that you're not true.

351
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:26,997
LAURA: 18.

352
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:31,420
MATT: 18. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

353
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,348
LIAM: Can I attack on her heels when she's done?

354
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:41,167
MATT: At this distance, it'll take a little bit to
rush up if you want to--

355
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,453
LIAM: 60 feet.

356
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:46,425
MATT: I'll say at this point they're roughly 60
feet from you, so if you wanted to--

357
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,126
LIAM: That's my distance.

358
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,870
MATT: Oh, if you go full speed, you can.

359
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,924
MARISHA: Daggers.

360
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:52,122
MATT: Oh, throwing it.

361
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:53,160
LAURA: 15 damage.

362
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,392
MATT: 15 damage. On which one, the skeleton or--

363
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:57,215
LAURA: Oh, that's sneak attack, right? Because I'm
hidden.

364
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,207
MATT: It would be from you, yes. The--

365
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,479
LAURA: Extra two.

366
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:06,619
MATT: What? Extra two. Okay. Is this against one
of the zombies or one of the skeletons?

367
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:10,410
LAURA: I was doing the one that was walking
towards us, I thought the other ones were still in

368
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,259
the area--

369
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,607
MATT: All right, then that would be one of the
zombies.

370
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:13,806
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

371
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:18,244
MATT: All right. The arrow streaks through the
air, slamming into the chest, and it embeds

372
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:23,961
itself, causing a piece of tendon to snap and curl
back inside the torso. Its arm falls a little more

373
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:27,656
limp than it was previously, and it just keeps
walking forward.

374
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:28,975
LAURA: I hide.

375
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:31,783
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a stealth
check. You--

376
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:34,664
LIAM: They're all grouped together?

377
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:38,723
MATT: Three of them are grouped together by the
tree. The one that noticed is slowly wandering

378
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:39,765
toward you.

379
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,461
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to throw at that one
as well.

380
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:42,309
MATT: Okay.

381
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,349
LAURA: 39. Stealth.

382
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:45,521
MATT: All right.

383
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:49,660
LIAM: I'm just going to throw one, and just to
check, I'm hidden, yeah?

384
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,571
MATT: Correct.

385
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:54,116
LIAM: So this is Assassinate, I have advantage
because it hasn't gone yet, and it's a crit

386
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:55,655
because I'm surprising it.

387
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:56,739
MATT: Mm-hm.

388
00:21:56,739 --> 00:22:04,851
LIAM: 25.

389
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:12,191
MATT: 25. With that, as this zombie entity is
hobbling forward, the dagger strikes it right in

390
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:19,562
the center of the skull, right where its mouth and
jaw hinge hit, severs the base of the skull to the

391
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:24,193
spine, and the head just rolls off onto the ground
underneath. The body takes two more steps before

392
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:27,032
falling forward.

393
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:31,305
LAURA: Yeah, do they all-- did any of the other
ones notice that?

394
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:37,121
MATT: All the other undead creatures all of a
sudden turn into the forest, as opposed to towards where

395
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,826
the death happened--

396
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:40,632
LAURA: Ah, shit.

397
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:44,513
MATT: And you see running out from the forest
towards you, a blue-skinned humanoid, rushing out,

398
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:47,394
arms in the air.

399
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:52,788
CHRIS: (in an Irish accent) Stop, stop, stop what
you're doing! Stop it! What have you done? What

400
00:22:52,788 --> 00:23:01,651
have you fucking done? It wasn't hurting anybody!
I don't understand it. Jesus Christ, these are not

401
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:03,190
easy to make.

402
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,524
TRAVIS: Are we killing this one?

403
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:07,680
SAM: No, no, don't kill him, he's precious.

404
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,050
CHRIS: What did I do?

405
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,411
SAM: Who are you? Who are you?

406
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:13,486
CHRIS: Who are you, you're fucking shooting at me,
you're asking me questions!

407
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:16,375
SAM: But these are zombies, these are undead,
these are creatures of evil!

408
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,809
LAURA: They were attacking us, they were attacking
him!

409
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:19,240
CHRIS: These were in my employ.

410
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,205
SAM: Oh.

411
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:22,420
LAURA: Well, you should keep a leash on them,
then.

412
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,134
CHRIS: That would be inhumane, wouldn't it?

413
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:26,183
SAM: They're not human.

414
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:29,194
CHRIS: Well, they were, that's very disrespectful
of you, I don't appreciate it.

415
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:31,637
LIAM: Are they pets? Are they friends? Where were
you--

416
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:33,007
CHRIS: They're friend-pets.

417
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,796
LIAM: You have to be around, though. To keep an
eye on them.

418
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:41,199
CHRIS: I know, but I've been traveling out here
for a while, and so they provide a layer of

419
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:46,572
protection. Certainly not great now. Now they were
four, now there's three.

420
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:50,494
LIAM: Well, listen, when we see these things
without an owner around, we take them out, I'm

421
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,284
sorry, it's pretty standard.

422
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:54,338
SAM: This can't be the first time this has
happened.

423
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:59,441
CHRIS: It does happen quite a lot, actually, yes.
Now that I think about it, it's probably a little

424
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:01,036
bit on me, I suppose.

425
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:04,240
SAM: Can you make them vests or something that
says 'service'?

426
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,877
CHRIS: That's a nice idea, as I'm a vest-maker.

427
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:09,696
LAURA: Put them in a bright color, put a happy
mask on them or something, so people know they're

428
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:10,782
nice.

429
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,898
CHRIS: Certainly, yeah, yeah, masks and vests,
that's a great idea.

430
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:19,606
MATT: You see agreeing before you a blue-scaled
dragonborn. If you would like to describe yourself

431
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:20,848
for the party.

432
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:27,726
CHRIS: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Where are my manners?
My name is Gern Blanston.

433
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,413
SAM: No, it's not.

434
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:30,585
CHRIS: It's Gern Blanston.

435
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,075
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

436
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:33,616
CHRIS: This one's very rude.

437
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:34,783
TRAVIS: He is.

438
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:38,194
CHRIS: You look exhausted.

439
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:44,724
SAM: This volcano-- do you live near here? This
volcano really takes the piss out of you.

440
00:24:44,724 --> 00:24:50,866
CHRIS: No, no, no, I don't live near here. Listen,
I've been traveling, I'm a simple candlemaker.

441
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,782
SAM: What are you doing on top of a volcano?

442
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:58,306
CHRIS: A volcano is nature's candle! What a stupid
question.

443
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:01,576
LAURA: You make candles, but you also make
undead?

444
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:05,970
CHRIS: Yes. They're-- yes. They're like
people-candles.

445
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,079
LAURA: Can I insight and see if he's telling the
truth?

446
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,009
MATT: Go for it.

447
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,216
LIAM: Our lives are so bizarre now.

448
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:15,756
LAURA: 17.

449
00:25:15,756 --> 00:25:21,445
MATT: 17. He's telling the truth.

450
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:26,171
CHRIS: Why is my brain tingling? Is someone
noodling around inside there?

451
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:34,939
MATT: She eyes you up and down, trying to get a
feel for whether or not you're who you say you are.

452
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:39,850
CHRIS: I make special candles. I make special
candles. I'm searching for some magical items up

453
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,792
here in this volcano. I understand there was a wee
bit of damage not long ago from a dragon that had

454
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:51,739
torn through the region, and so I'm just searching
for scraps to make these simple candles. That's

455
00:25:51,739 --> 00:26:01,812
why-- this is my dance vest. I think dancing is
very important. I'm alone most of the time, it

456
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:06,028
keeps me occupied. They have no appreciation for
the arts, these undead creatures that are

457
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:11,797
friend-pets, and, you know, I've just been digging
around up here, seeing what I can scrounge up and

458
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:13,466
find. What are you lot?

459
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:16,222
TRAVIS: Wait, are they special candles or are they
simple candles?

460
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:22,770
CHRIS: Well, some are simple. Some just create
light, and others create tragedy for people.

461
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,412
SAM: They're magical candles?

462
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:27,324
CHRIS: Yes, in a word. Actually, magic is the
perfect word.

463
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:33,028
MARISHA: Who exactly is the patronage of your
candle business? Who do you sell to?

464
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:39,202
CHRIS: I mean, I sell to no one in particular,
really. I have to be a little choosy about who

465
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:42,946
gets the candles, but it's something that I've
crafted over the years.

466
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:46,974
SAM: Well, we feel dreadful about killing one of
your pets.

467
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:48,518
MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

468
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:52,446
SAM: Perhaps we can purchase a candle off of you
to make amends.

469
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,636
CHRIS: Well, maybe you could just kill someone
else, and then I could just bring them back, I

470
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:57,522
mean, that would be a wonderful way to repay.

471
00:26:57,522 --> 00:27:00,494
LAURA: Well, you know what, we're on our way to do
just that thing.

472
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,697
CHRIS: Really?

473
00:27:01,697 --> 00:27:03,641
MARISHA: Things do tend to die around us a lot.

474
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:05,833
TRAVIS: Something larger things, sometimes smaller
things.

475
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,290
SAM: Would you like a body to reanimate or
something?

476
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,089
MARISHA: You might get something even bigger.

477
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,838
CHRIS: Are you inviting me to come along with
you?

478
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,352
SAM: I don't know. Are we?

479
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:16,950
CHRIS: Did I just invite myself to come along with
you?

480
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,801
TRAVIS: Well maybe, like, if you give us one of
those tragedy candles, we can always light it for

481
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:24,086
somebody. That could be good down the road.

482
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:30,381
MARISHA: Oh, like candles for funerals? That's
sad. We do have a lot of tragedy.

483
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:33,182
TRAVIS: We bake somebody a cake, we shove a candle
in the top, and we give it to them.

484
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:37,316
CHRIS: I don't think that would be a grand idea
unless you didn't like the person very much.

485
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:38,910
TRAVIS: Well, that's what I meant, yeah.

486
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:44,670
CHRIS: Well, I think for now I'll just hold onto
the candles I have and just see how things pan

487
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,478
out. I really don't know any of you.

488
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:51,738
SAM: We're Vox Machina, a traveling band of
adventurers led by me, Scanlan Shorthalt, and

489
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:57,816
these are my compatriots. We're on a very
important mission to get-- what are we doing?

490
00:27:57,816 --> 00:28:02,148
MARISHA: We're trying to close this giant rift
that we're walking into.

491
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,467
SAM: We have to break something big and scary.

492
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:05,891
CHRIS: What's your name again?

493
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:06,943
SAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

494
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:08,260
CHRIS: No, what's the name of your group?

495
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,259
LAURA: Vox Machina.

496
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,301
CHRIS: No offense, but that sounds like a shite
band.

497
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:13,434
LAURA: Thank you.

498
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:14,644
CHRIS: Are you musicians?

499
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:18,072
TALIESIN: It's better than Tragedy Candle, really,
I mean that's a shite band, to be fair.

500
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:27,292
CHRIS: (laughs) They opened for Vox Machina. They
were fantastic. Oh, am I not thinking of the right

501
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,827
thing? That's all right.

502
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:30,436
SAM: I'm a musician.

503
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:31,566
CHRIS: Excellent.

504
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:35,461
SAM: But these people, they can't really hold a
tune so much.

505
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:40,732
CHRIS: Listen, seeing as how that you've killed
one of my undead thralls, it'd be really nice if I

506
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:44,518
could join you to see if maybe we can scrounge up
some other things along the way.

507
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:45,860
LAURA: Then you'll help us?

508
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,138
CHRIS: I mean, we'll see how it pans out, but I
feel like everything would come to an abrupt

509
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:53,523
ending if I just walked away at this point.

510
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,879
LAURA: It would be very strange.

511
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:58,000
CHRIS: Thoroughly unsatisfying for anyone else who
might be witnessing this exchange.

512
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,966
SAM: Your undead pets, are they going to try and
eat our brains or anything?

513
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:06,157
CHRIS: No, no, they're just fine. That right there
is Coral, and that's Stimpy, and that's Fatty

514
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:07,181
Arbuckle.

515
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,938
SAM: Who was the one that we killed?

516
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:11,839
CHRIS: Oh, that was Carol. Very sad, very sad
indeed.

517
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,386
LAURA: Carol and Coral?

518
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:15,547
CHRIS: Carol and Coral. I get them confused.

519
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,713
MARISHA: Were they sisters?

520
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:21,925
CHRIS: No, no, no, they were not initially
related, but we became a makeshift family after a

521
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:22,889
while.

522
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:24,125
SAM: Oh, that's very beautiful.

523
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:28,218
CHRIS: I notice subtle differences that most of
the living doesn't notice.

524
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:30,354
TRAVIS: Aren't we supposed to be doing something
really like--

525
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,780
LAURA: Yeah, tell you what, Gern, we're
actually--

526
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,974
LIAM: It's dangerous around us, I don't know--

527
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:38,202
LAURA: We should probably press on, and you can
join us with your family.

528
00:29:38,202 --> 00:29:40,019
CHRIS: Please, that would be very nice.

529
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,521
TRAVIS: What was your name, one more time?

530
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:42,699
CHRIS: Gern Blanston.

531
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:43,760
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

532
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,581
CHRIS: Gern.

533
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:48,261
TRAVIS: Well, let's go, let's move along then,
Gern, yeah? You good to come along with your herd of--

534
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:50,500
SAM: Can you fight and stuff in case shit goes
down?

535
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,645
MARISHA: If you make magical candles, you must
know a little bit of magic, correct?

536
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:58,188
CHRIS: I'm a little bit better of a spellcaster
than I am a fisticuffs type of person.

537
00:29:58,188 --> 00:29:59,308
MARISHA: Okay.

538
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:02,593
LAURA: Perfect. We're short on magic people.
That's wonderful.

539
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,142
CHRIS: Excellent. No offense.

540
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:06,393
SAM: All taken.

541
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:10,214
TRAVIS: We move along.

542
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:14,953
LAURA: Are we still trying to stealth? Or does it
even matter?

543
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,879
LIAM: Your dead things don't stealth, I would
assume?

544
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:25,333
CHRIS: They're not very delicate, unfortunately.
No, no, they're really for protection. Now, the

545
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:29,149
zombies can really take a lot of damage to the
front of the chest and the skeletons are quite

546
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:33,406
quick, actually. So, you know. They've been fairly
good for a while.

547
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:34,240
LAURA: All right.

548
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,448
TALIESIN: Good to know.

549
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,997
LAURA: We head towards the thing.

550
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:39,145
TRAVIS: Stealthily.

551
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:40,372
CHRIS: To the thing!

552
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,974
TRAVIS: Shush! Stealthily.

553
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:43,448
CHRIS: (whispering) To the thing!

554
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:46,621
MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check, if you
don't mind, Gern.

555
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:49,289
LAURA: Does my Pass Without a Trace work on him
too, does it like envelop him--

556
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,672
MATT: Nope. He wasn't there when you cast it.

557
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:52,755
CHRIS: 11.

558
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:53,776
TRAVIS: Fuck.

559
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:54,622
MATT: 11?

560
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:55,918
TALIESIN: He's not under Pass Without a Trace.

561
00:30:55,918 --> 00:31:01,843
MATT: No, and then-- No. As you guys begin
stealthily, there is a couple of (footfalls) heavy

562
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:03,353
footfalls of the lumbering dragonborn.

563
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:04,692
CHRIS: These old dragon feet--

564
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:07,368
MATT: No tail on this one.

565
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:09,711
SAM: What happened to your tail?

566
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,160
CHRIS: Please don't ask me about that.

567
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,133
SAM: Okay, I won't.

568
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:15,231
MATT: The only other dragonborn you've seen
without a tail was the paladin that worked in the

569
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:22,736
Council. Tofor Brotorus. So, that does catch your
attention a little bit. Not just the dragonborn

570
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:27,380
lumbering, but now the three undead that are
(groaning) stepping behind.

571
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,623
LAURA: They're worse than Trinket, Scanlan.

572
00:31:29,623 --> 00:31:31,899
MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know if stealth is
going to be a thing, going forward.

573
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,689
TALIESIN: (whistling)

574
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:36,729
TRAVIS: Yeah! (whistles)

575
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:37,905
LAURA: Okay.

576
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:43,680
CHRIS: Sorry, these dragon lips can't whistle.
Mostly just fire comes out.

577
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,781
MATT: And it's at that point you hear the cracking
of what sounds like heavy timber, no more than 30

578
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:53,898
feet away from you. You all stop in place suddenly
and you glance over and you can see the flickering

579
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:59,975
of light of what appears to be a flame-based
elemental energy that's tearing over the side of a

580
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:03,265
newly fallen petrifoid-- petrifoid-- (mocking
Chris' accent) petrifoid tree, look what you've

581
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,785
done to me! This is your fault!

582
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:08,106
TRAVIS: Gern, son of a bitch.

583
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:12,695
CHRIS: Purple hearts, green stars! Purple hearts.

584
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:15,259
SAM: Seen some shit.

585
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:19,900
CHRIS: Special veteran's edition of Lucky Charms.

586
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,761
MATT: Very, very Lucky Charms.

587
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:24,117
CHRIS: Very Lucky Charms.

588
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,742
LIAM: Shit.

589
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,609
MATT: So!

590
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:29,040
TALIESIN: Well, that got dark.

591
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,569
MATT: Yeah, how about that?

592
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:32,044
LIAM: Back to normal, then, eh?

593
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,060
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay.

594
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,234
MATT: So. As the flame begins to trickle and burn
over the edge, you can see there is an

595
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:39,782
intelligence to it. There are a couple of arms
that writhe over the side and the head pops

596
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:45,154
over and glances, and stops in place, frozen,
staring over in the direction of the bounding

597
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:46,637
dragonborn.

598
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:48,497
MARISHA: It's a fire elemental?

599
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:52,641
MATT: It's smaller than what you're used to
seeing, but it is indeed a creature made of

600
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:54,120
elemental flame.

601
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:01,770
MARISHA: Would he be considered a primordial?

602
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,262
MATT: It would be considered an elemental.

603
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:08,408
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go fire elemental.

604
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:11,215
MATT: Okay. So you're using your transform--

605
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:13,901
MARISHA: Seeing it, I'm going to transform and go
into my fire elemental.

606
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:15,229
TRAVIS: Is this the first time you've done that?

607
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:16,599
LAURA: No no, she's done that.

608
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,384
MARISHA: Is this the first time I've been fire
elemental?

609
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:20,940
MATT: I think it's the first time you've been fire
elemental, yeah?

610
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,988
LAURA: Really?

611
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:23,405
MARISHA: Yeah, learned from Cerkonos, yeah.

612
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:26,012
MATT: So, you guys watch as Keyleth's form
suddenly erupts into flame, which freaks you out

613
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:29,456
for a second, as you're uncertain as to whether or
not she did that.

614
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:32,206
TRAVIS: Keyleth! Are you all right?

615
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:35,884
MARISHA: In fire elemental, just like--

616
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:37,967
LAURA: Does it still look like Keyleth or-- what
does it look like?

617
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:44,153
MATT: It has for a moment, an essence of Keyleth's
more lithe form that most elementals would, but

618
00:33:44,153 --> 00:33:49,588
still these long, curling flame like-arms, these
eyes that glow a bright white fire in the center

619
00:33:49,588 --> 00:33:53,085
of the face. Other than that, relatively formless
other than what looks like where her hair would

620
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:55,921
be, these wisps of flame curl up behind her.

621
00:33:55,921 --> 00:34:01,009
LAURA: Pretty freaking sick. Can you talk to it?

622
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,748
MARISHA: That's what I'm going to go do.

623
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:04,130
MATT: So as you approach the elemental form--

624
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:10,727
MARISHA: So I approach and I'm going to do the
animal instinct thing and poof up and make myself

625
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:12,080
a little big.

626
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,852
MATT: The creature behind the form, you can see,
is drifting away from the trunk of the tree.

627
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:19,497
MARISHA: Oh, it's running from me?

628
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:21,388
MATT: It's turned away and is moving away from
you, yeah.

629
00:34:21,388 --> 00:34:22,863
SAM: That was easy.

630
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:27,966
MARISHA: Deuces. And I roll back.

631
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,630
LAURA: I thought we were supposed to keep them
from coming out into this world.

632
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,237
MARISHA: Are we-- wait. Are we in the fire plane
yet?

633
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:37,123
MATT: No no, you're just-- you're in the caldera
to--

634
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:38,406
MARISHA: Oh, we're in the caldera.

635
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:42,755
MATT: Yeah, you haven't traversed the plane.
You're making your way into the remnants of the

636
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:43,734
Cindergrove.

637
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,234
LAURA: Maybe you should ask it to go back.

638
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:50,417
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to say "Halt!" in Ignan.
Which I'm assuming it speaks.

639
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:56,180
MATT: You guys hear in the distance this echo of
this weird sucking-crackling sound that goes-- It

640
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:03,533
halts for a second, looks over its shoulder and
then goes into double speed, disappearing into the

641
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,092
trees. Away from you.

642
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:09,580
TRAVIS: Kind of following your lead here.

643
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:18,835
MARISHA: I follow after it and I say, in the name
of the guardians of this realm, you will stop!

644
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:24,355
MATT: Okay, as you follow it past the initial
treeline, it's where a bunch of trees have fallen

645
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:29,337
over and formed a small blockade in this portion
of the forest. You glance over as you're shouting

646
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:36,092
that and you can see what appear to be another of
the same small elemental that this one has gone

647
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:42,294
to, to have a brief conversation. Beyond that, you
see a larger one, roughly your size, that has just

648
00:35:42,294 --> 00:35:46,383
turned around and noticed your presence, and all
of them look over at what appears to be another

649
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:53,100
humanoid creature, but instead of a lower torso of
legs, it's an elongated snake-like body, its black

650
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,578
and red scales across its entire form, two human
arms and a humanoid face but these webbed red

651
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:01,625
spines down its entire back.

652
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:05,383
SAM: Gern, is that one of yours? That's you, Gern.
Gern.

653
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:10,745
CHRIS: No, I don't know who this is. I don't-- I'm
not familiar. I'm not familiar with who this is.

654
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:12,721
LAURA: I take my potion of fire resistance.

655
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:17,607
CHRIS: I could send them a present in the form of
a candle, if you prefer.

656
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:19,248
LAURA: Do it.

657
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:22,786
MATT: At this point in time, Keyleth, as you're
standing there, looking over this edge, they all

658
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:33,325
turn and the creature, the weird-- I'll say it-- a
salamander-like creature, begins shouting out

659
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:40,515
phrases in Ignan, which you understand. It says,
"Go! He's not here yet! Alleviate this

660
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:48,021
"uncontrolled one!" At which point, they all begin
to swarm towards you.

661
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:59,535
MARISHA: At which point I'm going to do a fire
intimidation tactic. I'm going to do a fire radial

662
00:36:59,535 --> 00:37:10,276
thing. And I'm going to say, as the leader of this
realm, as the Kaitaki of the Fire Nation, you will

663
00:37:10,276 --> 00:37:13,433
heed my word.

664
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,269
CHRIS: Quite dramatic, isn't she?

665
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:21,816
MATT: As you guys are watching this from a
distance, all you hear is (guttural noises). It's

666
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:23,982
really confusing and a little hilarious, to be
honest.

667
00:37:23,982 --> 00:37:25,531
LAURA: I think it's going well.

668
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:27,923
MATT: I need you to make an intimidation check.

669
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:38,825
MARISHA: No, that one fails me a lot.

670
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:40,863
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure it fails you.

671
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:42,210
MATT: What you got, Keyleth?

672
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,892
MARISHA: It does! Shut up, Travis. Natural 20!

673
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:47,421
TRAVIS: Ha. Thought I made a point.

674
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:52,677
MATT: All right. As this happens, the two smaller
elementals shrink down and glance over at the

675
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:59,701
larger one. The larger one looks about and shouts
back at you in Ignan, once again: "Do you serve him?"

676
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:11,663
MARISHA: It doesn't matter who I serve, for I am
above him. I am your master now. This is not your

677
00:38:11,663 --> 00:38:19,627
realm. Get back into the fire plane. Where you
came from.

678
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:26,023
MATT: He looks back at the long snake-like
humanoid who's standing there who glances at the

679
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:36,364
other one and goes, "She wants us back. Very
well." And they all turn around and begin to

680
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:39,854
slowly drift back towards the center of the
Cindergrove where the flickering light was.

681
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:41,104
MARISHA: Holy shit.

682
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:42,594
LAURA: Good job, Keyleth!

683
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:44,086
TRAVIS: We don't know what happened, why are we
clapping?

684
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:46,044
LAURA: They're turning around, they're heading
back in that direction!

685
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:51,578
MARISHA: I fly back over to them, still in fire
elemental form--

686
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:53,093
LIAM: Whoa whoa whoa!

687
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:55,290
MARISHA: And I'm like: You guys! Did you see that!
It was really crazy! Did you see? Did you see?

688
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,500
They think I'm their leader! They think I'm their
god!

689
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,052
TRAVIS: Is she talking in normal, or is she
talking in the (flickering flames).

690
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:02,549
MATT: (flickering flames)

691
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,141
TRAVIS: Yeah, no idea what you're doing or saying.

692
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,403
LAURA: You're very scary right now, dear.

693
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:06,611
CHRIS: Is she going to be sick?

694
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:10,727
TRAVIS: I think so. I might have to tackle you if
you don't calm the fuck down.

695
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:15,525
MARISHA: I chill out. I chill out, I can't revert
back, though, guys, because I want to stay in this.

696
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:20,510
MATT: So the fire elemental is just like (calm
whoosh). And it's more of a smoldering sad

697
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,034
elemental at the moment.

698
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:23,563
MARISHA: I give them a fire thumbs-up.

699
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:25,771
MATT: There you go. Strong sad elemental.

700
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:27,243
LIAM: First word. Two syllables.

701
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:33,040
TRAVIS: So, they're going back. Do we move on?

702
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,333
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

703
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:43,712
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to take off, leading in
my fire elemental form, deeper towards the rift.

704
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:48,682
Keeping my eye out for any elementals that might
be escaping.

705
00:39:48,682 --> 00:39:50,099
MATT: All right.

706
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,366
TALIESIN: This is her game.

707
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:53,101
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's on fire.

708
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:59,316
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

709
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:01,935
LAURA: What?

710
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,747
CHRIS: 18.

711
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:08,789
MATT: Okay. Vex, make a perception check.

712
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:11,446
TRAVIS: Roll high.

713
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:13,711
LAURA: Pressure!

714
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,361
TALIESIN: Use one of your good dice.

715
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:17,700
LAURA: Perception.

716
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,078
LIAM: And roll bad.

717
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:20,263
LAURA: Shut up.

718
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:21,546
TALIESIN: Should've used the good dice.

719
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,089
LAURA: 30. No. 28.

720
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,447
MATT: 28?

721
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:27,531
SAM: Yep! Wait, are you exhausted?

722
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:29,559
MATT: Yeah, you are.

723
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,752
LAURA: On everything?

724
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:32,200
MATT: Skill check. Roll again.

725
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,904
LAURA: No, even better!

726
00:40:33,904 --> 00:40:35,114
TRAVIS: Even better.

727
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:36,213
LIAM: So it's the earlier.

728
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:39,678
MATT: So it's the earlier one, yeah. Okay. You
just see, as you're all just walking along, your

729
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:44,547
new blue dragonborn friend just reaches down and
snatches something from the dirt, pockets it and

730
00:40:44,547 --> 00:40:45,998
keeps walking.

731
00:40:45,998 --> 00:40:51,020
LAURA: I follow behind him and keep watching him.
Can I see what it was?

732
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,361
MATT: You have no idea. You just see a little
cluster of ash and dust on the ground that's been

733
00:40:55,361 --> 00:41:03,572
partially disturbed. All right. As you continue to
press forward, you hear in the distance a loud

734
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:07,495
cracking sound echoing, and you can see what
appear to be a number of trees in the far-off side

735
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:15,897
to the northeastern side of the forest, as a brief
whirlwind flickers up. You assume this is probably

736
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:19,706
from the Fire Ashari, who've taken that side of
the entranceway, and you can see two flickering

737
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:23,747
lights drift up in the air before sparking out in
the distance.

738
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,009
TRAVIS: Ooh, really?

739
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,050
LAURA: Should we let them know we're in place,
then?

740
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,819
MARISHA: I'll throw up a Skywrite. Or actually, as
a fire elemental, can I just be like (fire flares)

741
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:33,514
in fire elemental form?

742
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:36,487
MATT: I mean, you can make some localized fire
happen.

743
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:39,646
MARISHA: Can I send up a little bit like a flare?

744
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:43,591
MATT: Not in the way you would want to, you'd have
to drop form for that and cast a spell.

745
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:44,557
MARISHA: Fuck.

746
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:49,302
LAURA: I'm going to set an arrow on fire and shoot
it up in the air.

747
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:51,704
MARISHA: I don't realize she's doing it.

748
00:41:51,704 --> 00:41:56,482
MATT: Okay. As you go ahead and take the arrow--
What do you have around the edge that are going

749
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:58,206
to-- are you just going to light the shaft on
fire?

750
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:03,242
LAURA: No, I'm going to tie some of my cloth
from-- you know-- that I have-- The thing.

751
00:42:03,242 --> 00:42:04,207
TRAVIS: Yeah.

752
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:08,503
LAURA: I take some cloth from the Bag of Holding,
from one of those old fancy cloaks that we have.

753
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:10,671
TRAVIS: Better ask first.

754
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:14,902
LAURA: (sighs) Seriously?! Can I have some of the
fancy cloak? Grog, out of the Bag of Holding, please?

755
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:16,497
TRAVIS: Oh, are you hot right now? It's so weird.

756
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:17,833
LAURA: Jesus Christ. Please.

757
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:18,976
TRAVIS: Oh, all right. Fancy cloak.

758
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:28,432
MATT: There you go. The arrow arcs off. Vanishes
across the little bit of the remaining treeline.

759
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:29,920
LAURA: No idea if they saw that.

760
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,202
MATT: All right. Do you guys continue to press
forward?

761
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:36,041
MARISHA: Hold for a second. And wait for Team
Three's response?

762
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,752
SAM: There's a third team?

763
00:42:37,752 --> 00:42:39,401
MARISHA: Right, there's a third team. Three teams,
right?

764
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:41,434
LAURA: All the other teams already responded. We
were the third.

765
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,248
MARISHA: Oh! One, two, we were three. Okay, yeah.

766
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:50,785
MATT: Okay. You begin to push further forward
towards the center of the Cindergrove, as you're

767
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:56,699
noticing more and more of these trees are pushed
flat. It's almost like that Russian forest the

768
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,535
meteor had landed in and exploded; all the trees
are flattened--

769
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,712
CHRIS: Tunguska.

770
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:06,731
MATT: Think Tunguska, thank you. Where you begin
to climb over a number of these flattened portions

771
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:12,691
of the forest, and in the center you can see that
one river of molten rock that had been trickling

772
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:17,476
down the front of the mountain is sourced here in
the center, where once previously you guys had

773
00:43:17,476 --> 00:43:22,370
performed a ritual to pass into the elemental
plane, has now torn into this extremely bright rift

774
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,736
that flickers. It's like looking into the sun, you
have to avert your gaze; you cannot look directly

775
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:30,983
at it without actually hurting your eyesight. And
you can see, there are multiple paths of this

776
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:37,422
molten lava, pouring out from this new volcanic
activity. You can see it burbling up and bubbling

777
00:43:37,422 --> 00:43:43,135
underneath, like the very presence of this tear
itself is causing the activity to just raise and

778
00:43:43,135 --> 00:43:50,299
grow more fervent. At the base of the rift, you
can see a number of other elemental creatures that

779
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:53,419
are in the process of surrounding this opening--

780
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:55,063
(door creak)

781
00:43:55,063 --> 00:43:57,879
MATT: -- and you can-- Everything all right, Ryan?

782
00:43:57,879 --> 00:44:00,179
RYAN: I am not here.

783
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,885
MATT: You're not here, okay?

784
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:03,554
SAM: You don't know.

785
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:04,755
MATT: I don't know.

786
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,874
CHRIS: You guys see him too?

787
00:44:06,874 --> 00:44:13,095
MATT: Perfect. As you can see, all these elemental
entities are swirling around. There are two more

788
00:44:13,095 --> 00:44:20,182
of these strange, snake-like humans, these
salamander-like creatures that are discussing, and

789
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:24,813
one really large one that stands there holding
this strange trident-like structure, and it's

790
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:30,775
shouting out commands left and right, and you can
see these salamander entities and a number of

791
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:36,798
these elementals are all gathered around the
portal, and they're all just focusing this slow,

792
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:41,494
steady beam towards it. And as you can see it
tearing, flickering and slowly expanding with each

793
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:46,919
popping expansion of this doorway, the ground
itself shifts and rumbles.

794
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:48,352
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark the big one.

795
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,336
MATT: All right.

796
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:52,777
CHRIS: Can I send a candle?

797
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,761
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

798
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:59,109
CHRIS: All right, what am I looking at, here?
Fire? There's a bit of fire?

799
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:05,423
MATT: There's a lot of fire. Most of these
entities are either fire essence or just made out

800
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:06,704
of straight flame.

801
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:13,198
CHRIS: I'd like to call over the skeleton known as
Fatty Arbuckle. I'd like to give Fatty Arbuckle an

802
00:45:13,198 --> 00:45:16,064
Ice Storm Candle.

803
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:17,703
MATT: All right.

804
00:45:17,703 --> 00:45:24,793
CHRIS: And ask him to kindly deliver it to the
center of this melee that's happening just up

805
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:25,493
ahead.

806
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:27,311
SAM: Won't that kill your friend?

807
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:29,841
CHRIS: Oh. He's had a good run.

808
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:34,714
TALIESIN: I'm feeling a lot less guilty,
suddenly.

809
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:38,541
CHRIS: Well, I can do it! What I don't appreciate
is when other people do it.

810
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,670
SAM: That's fair. That's fair.

811
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,535
CHRIS: You know, it's my choice. Never said it was
okay for you to start lighting them up with

812
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:48,573
arrows. Jesus Christ, whoever that is.

813
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:53,480
LAURA: I'm Vex'ahlia, nice to meet you.

814
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,648
MATT: Fatty Arbuckle, skeletal claws clasped
around the side of this marbled-looking,

815
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:05,691
bluish-white candle, and clutches it and just goes
(snarl).

816
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:11,209
CHRIS: Yes, off you trot, go!

817
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:13,082
SAM: You don't have to demean him as he goes.

818
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:17,896
TALIESIN: I was really hoping for a Fatty Arbuckle
skeleton impression. I was really, really hoping

819
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:20,279
for it. What you did was cool, but like, that was
just my heart.

820
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:25,020
CHRIS: They can't speak. They don't have voice
boxes or anything.

821
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,548
MATT: As it shuffles forward, down this ashen pit
towards the dome where the lava itself is

822
00:46:29,548 --> 00:46:36,545
beginning to pour forth and the doorway is, you
can see the shadow of its form as the light

823
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:41,319
passes. It looks like the cover of The Thing, how
it's just bright light coursing past this dark

824
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:44,381
image of the skeleton, walking away from you.

825
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:47,824
LAURA: Maybe we should duck down, so that nobody
knows where that came from.

826
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:49,838
CHRIS: Oh, yes, get ten feet back, I should've
said that already.

827
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:56,336
MATT: It's walked quite a distance, thankfully, at
this point. It's probably a good 40 or 50 feet

828
00:46:56,336 --> 00:47:02,200
before it reaches the first salamander. And you
see, as it begins to step forward, they all turn

829
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:09,157
and look, and one of them shouts over (snarling).
One of them glances over, reaches out and pulls

830
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:16,338
out a long, brass-colored longbow and begins to
notch an arrow carefully, as it hobbles forward.

831
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:22,900
They look at each other. One of them shouts out in
Ignan, which you understand, Keyleth, shouting,

832
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:32,684
"You! Who walks here?" Just keeps walking forward
like a little wind-up toy made of bone. Until

833
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:41,515
eventually, the one with the bow gives a nudge
with its head, and the other salamander entity

834
00:47:41,515 --> 00:47:47,502
draws a heavy-bladed object and begins to step
forward towards it, ready to go ahead and cleave

835
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:54,337
it. As the skeleton steps forward, it gets right
at the corner of its range. Do you want to command it?

836
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:56,681
MARISHA: I feel like Helen Hunt in that moment in
Twister.

837
00:47:56,681 --> 00:47:58,851
CHRIS: Squeeze the candle, Fatty Arbuckle!

838
00:47:58,851 --> 00:48:06,321
MATT: At which point, the skeleton, just as the
blade sweeps past and crashes into its torso,

839
00:48:06,321 --> 00:48:12,806
shattering the rib cage, the arms go (crack). The
wax bends and cracks in the center, and there's a

840
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:23,644
brief pause where nothing seems to happen. And a
swirl of sudden, localized storming blizzard just

841
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:29,462
encases a ten-foot radius, hitting both of those
salamander creatures. What does it say on the

842
00:48:29,462 --> 00:48:31,024
candle specifically?

843
00:48:31,024 --> 00:48:40,650
CHRIS: On the Ice Storm Candle. All affected must
make a dexterity saving throw, DC 12, or suffer

844
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,736
4d6 cold damage.

845
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:46,680
MATT: That's a fail and a save. And it's half
damage on success?

846
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,075
CHRIS: Half damage on success.

847
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:51,267
MATT: Great. Okay, so one of them failed and one
of them saved. So go ahead and roll 4d6 damage.

848
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:54,510
TRAVIS: Dang. I think that's a good way to start.

849
00:48:54,510 --> 00:49:02,033
CHRIS: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh boy.
Three, six, nine.

850
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:08,971
MATT: Nine? Okay, nine and five cold damage to each.
So (bang) it blasts open. Oh, and a dexterity

851
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:15,964
check for your buddy, who makes it! So, Fatty
Arbuckle actually walks out of there with a mere

852
00:49:15,964 --> 00:49:18,248
five points of cold damage.

853
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:19,379
LAURA: Nice, Fatty!

854
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:22,915
MATT: Out of ice and frost. His busted-open rib
cage, though, he did suffer...

855
00:49:22,915 --> 00:49:24,867
LIAM: Super duper!

856
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:29,431
TRAVIS: Putting on the Ritz!

857
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:37,792
MATT: Did suffer seven damage from the impact of
this weapon. So Fatty Arbuckle, pretty damaged,

858
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:41,232
but still standing there just going (snarling).

859
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:45,403
CHRIS: Keep standing, Fatty, you can do it! I love
you, Fatty!

860
00:49:45,403 --> 00:49:47,746
MATT: Is everyone just going to sit back at this,
or--?

861
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:49,384
LAURA: No, we should probably attack.

862
00:49:49,384 --> 00:49:52,731
MATT: It's up to you. Or you can watch this
horrible bludgeoning of this skeleton in the teeth

863
00:49:52,731 --> 00:49:53,610
of death.

864
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,291
TRAVIS: When I see the salamander take out the
big, shiny sharp thing, I go into a rage.

865
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:59,426
LAURA: I hide.

866
00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:01,580
MATT: All right. Travis, I assume you're going to
be rushing in there, then?

867
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,439
TRAVIS: Yeah.

868
00:50:02,439 --> 00:50:05,086
MATT: Anyone who wishes to immediately go into
battle now, let's roll initiative.

869
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,246
TALIESIN: All right. I'm in on this.

870
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:07,574
MATT: All right. Let me go ahead and--

871
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:08,831
SAM: For Fatty!

872
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:14,273
MARISHA: So these are all fire elementals. Should
I continue--

873
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:16,759
TALIESIN: Oh, hell yeah.

874
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:17,683
CHRIS: Ah, nice.

875
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:21,357
LAURA: Should we roll for stealth again, or are we
still stealthed?

876
00:50:21,357 --> 00:50:26,862
CHRIS: I was just shouting at a skeleton.

877
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:30,072
LAURA: Oh, I know, I was trying to hide, though.
Like, back away from you as you were doing that.

878
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:33,369
TRAVIS: The candle turned into a blizzard, so.
Ooh!

879
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:36,128
TALIESIN: Is it a candle, though? It's like a
thing, like there's no--

880
00:50:36,128 --> 00:50:39,924
LIAM: And I mean, Gern was shouting.

881
00:50:39,924 --> 00:50:42,979
TALIESIN: It's a candle the way the wheelie things
are hoverboards. I think it's weird.

882
00:50:42,979 --> 00:50:46,514
CHRIS: And they also catch on fire. They also
explode.

883
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:52,670
MATT: All right, so this is quite a ways away from
the portal itself. Lava flow traveling around that side.

884
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,198
TALIESIN: Oh, look at that!

885
00:50:57,198 --> 00:50:59,673
MATT: All right, and we have Keyleth over here as
the fire elemental.

886
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:00,922
LAURA: You're at the portal.

887
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:01,981
MARISHA: Huh?

888
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:04,891
LAURA: That's okay. We're all going to die.

889
00:51:04,891 --> 00:51:06,472
TRAVIS: No.

890
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:07,702
TALIESIN: Where's the big one?

891
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,872
MATT: The big one that you haven't seen yet?

892
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:12,321
LAURA: The big one that I Hunter's Marked.

893
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:15,319
TALIESIN: That one. The one holding the tridenty
thing.

894
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:16,776
MATT: Oh, sorry.

895
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,301
TALIESIN: Thank you.

896
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:24,499
LAURA: Whoa. Look at how pretty those lava bubbles
look!

897
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:26,323
SAM: Is that Gern?

898
00:51:26,323 --> 00:51:28,560
MATT: That's Gern right there.

899
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,283
We have Fatty Arbuckle.

900
00:51:30,283 --> 00:51:32,820
TALIESIN: Fatty!

901
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:38,766
MATT: And chilling over here, we have Coral and
Stimpy.

902
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:43,171
TRAVIS: What is that crater? Is that just a
crater?

903
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:45,737
LIAM: I think that's the portal they were trying
to--

904
00:51:45,737 --> 00:51:53,109
SAM: So these are fire elementals, yes?

905
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:56,333
MATT: They seem to be fire-based creatures, yes.

906
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,409
LIAM: Hey, DM!

907
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:58,234
MATT: Yes.

908
00:51:58,234 --> 00:51:59,980
LIAM: You said they were ripping open the portal?
Where is that on the map?

909
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,745
MATT: It's back, it's this far back.

910
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,831
LIAM: Way back, okay.

911
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,435
TRAVIS: That crater's just a crater, though?

912
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:11,059
MATT: Yeah. There is a pool of magma that goes
this way. You guys are on one side of it, and

913
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:16,395
pushing this way further, the rest of the actual
portal's back this far. All right. So, initiative

914
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:19,331
order, we have 25 to 20, anyone?

915
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:20,222
SAM: 22.

916
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:21,466
TALIESIN: 27.

917
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:26,021
TRAVIS: Fucking Percy. Jesus. Every time. You
motherfucker.

918
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:28,360
TALIESIN: I'm fast as fuck.

919
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:34,999
MATT: Okay. 20 to 15.

920
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:36,755
TRAVIS: 17.

921
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:39,301
CHRIS: 19.

922
00:52:39,301 --> 00:52:43,482
LIAM: 16. Carl!

923
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:49,354
MATT: All right.

924
00:52:49,354 --> 00:52:51,128
LAURA: 13.

925
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:56,119
MATT: 13. Keyleth?

926
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:58,805
MARISHA: Four.

927
00:52:58,805 --> 00:53:02,739
MATT: All right, great. So, top of the round,
Percy, you're up first.

928
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:11,816
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to use my pistol. I'm going to do a trick shot for

929
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:17,884
the arms. Actually, the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to use my bonus action to-- you

930
00:53:17,884 --> 00:53:26,123
know, actually, I'm going to hold off on that. I'm
going to make an arm shot to the

931
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,459
one with the trident.

932
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:28,726
MATT: All righty.

933
00:53:28,726 --> 00:53:39,474
TALIESIN: That was my first shot. And that's 25.

934
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:41,181
MATT: 25 hits.

935
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:46,286
TALIESIN: And that's a strength saving throw.

936
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:50,965
MATT: Strength saving throw. That is going to be a
20.

937
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,383
TALIESIN: That just barely makes it.

938
00:53:52,383 --> 00:53:57,055
MATT: Aw. The blast of your impact (bang) hits the
arm. He manages to hold onto his

939
00:53:57,055 --> 00:53:58,660
trident-like weapon.

940
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,590
TALIESIN: That's fine. He's going to take his
damage, and then he's going to take another one of

941
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,051
those, because eff that.

942
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:05,601
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage on
that.

943
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:07,104
TRAVIS: Because eff that.

944
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:12,623
TALIESIN: That's 13 points of damage.

945
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:15,086
MATT: 13 points of damage. All righty.

946
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,630
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to take another
shot.

947
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,354
MATT: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up on deck, by
the way, so be ready.

948
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:21,370
TALIESIN: 20.

949
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,561
MATT: 20 hits.

950
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:24,715
TALIESIN: Strength check.

951
00:54:24,715 --> 00:54:26,566
MATT: That's a nine.

952
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,212
TALIESIN: He dropped that.

953
00:54:28,212 --> 00:54:31,990
MATT: Failure. (gunshot) You see his fingers are
pried off as one of his pinky fingers is actually

954
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:37,833
blown off from the impact, shooting dark, deep
crimson blood that seems to burn the landscape

955
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:42,887
around as it drips, the trident tumbling to the
ground and getting lodged in a piece of rock,

956
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:44,876
almost ready to spill into part of the lava.

957
00:54:44,876 --> 00:54:47,864
TALIESIN: And that does seven points of damage.

958
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,392
MATT: Seven points of damage, all righty.

959
00:54:49,392 --> 00:54:51,031
TALIESIN: Third shot's going to be a sharpshooter
shot.

960
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:52,659
MATT: All righty. So minus five to the attack.

961
00:54:52,659 --> 00:55:01,168
TALIESIN: That's probably going to miss. 14.

962
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:03,268
MATT: 14, unfortunately, misses.

963
00:55:03,268 --> 00:55:07,641
TALIESIN: All right. That misses. I'm going to
take a run behind and hide behind that rock

964
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:09,373
outcropping.

965
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,485
MATT: There? Okay. Got it. Scanlan, you're up.

966
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:15,669
SAM: Do I see that big thing in the back?

967
00:55:15,669 --> 00:55:19,501
MATT: This big thing here? Yeah, the fire
elemental. You see that.

968
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:24,706
SAM: Okay. And the thing next to Fatty Arbuckle is
also a baddie, yeah? They're all baddies?

969
00:55:24,706 --> 00:55:26,207
MATT: These things are all baddies here.

970
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:34,852
SAM: All right. I'm going to take 15 feet, step to
my right to put me in a straight line with the guy

971
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:43,376
next to Fatty and the big guy behind him. And then
fire a Lightning Bolt straight ahead to hit both

972
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:47,179
of them. I hope they're not immune to lightning.
We'll find out.

973
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:52,467
MATT: All righty. So, and you watch out of the
corner as well, Gern, you see this tiny little

974
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:59,046
gnome step to the side, conjure some arcane
purplish-blue energy, and then thrust his pelvis

975
00:55:59,046 --> 00:56:02,277
forward as a bolt of lightning energy just
rockets forth, tearing--

976
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:03,407
SAM: From my penis.

977
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:04,767
CHRIS: Nice. Of course.

978
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:07,367
SAM: Just felt like I had to make that clear.

979
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:12,688
CHRIS: Oh, I don't think I've ever seen that
happen before.

980
00:56:12,688 --> 00:56:13,847
TALIESIN: We have.

981
00:56:13,847 --> 00:56:14,867
LAURA: So many times.

982
00:56:14,867 --> 00:56:16,038
CHRIS: Have to get that looked at.

983
00:56:16,038 --> 00:56:17,725
MATT: Slamming both into the larger salamander
creature and the elemental behind it. Go ahead and

984
00:56:17,725 --> 00:56:21,201
roll 8d6 damage. What's the DC on this?

985
00:56:21,201 --> 00:56:22,684
SAM: Is it my spell save DC?

986
00:56:22,684 --> 00:56:23,602
MATT: Yes.

987
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:24,891
SAM: With the hand-cone?

988
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:25,812
MATT: Yeah.

989
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:26,700
SAM: 20.

990
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,738
MATT: Ooh! That is a failure and a failure!

991
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:32,925
TRAVIS: Yes!

992
00:56:32,925 --> 00:56:34,616
MATT: All right. So full damage against both.

993
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:35,754
SAM: 27.

994
00:56:35,754 --> 00:56:45,170
MATT: Oof. All righty. As the bolt of lightning
energy tears through both of them, eventually

995
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,438
absorbed into the stone behind them, the elemental
flame form flickers and falls to the ground for a

996
00:56:50,438 --> 00:56:54,907
second, trying to reform itself, while the
salamander looks down at this blackened, burned

997
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:58,705
char mark in the center of its torso from where
the bolt entered and exited out of its back to

998
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:02,471
strike its compadre. Not too happy, and confused
how such a large, damaging thing came from such a

999
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:05,205
small little creature.

1000
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:14,023
SAM: It's powerful. Then I'll turn to our new
friend Gern, and I will inspire him. I'll say,

1001
00:57:14,023 --> 00:57:20,679
please, help us, and to inspire you I will sing
you a song. And I will sing--

1002
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:22,924
CHRIS: Pretty inspired by your dick lightning, to
be honest.

1003
00:57:22,924 --> 00:57:23,977
SAM: Oh, there's more.

1004
00:57:23,977 --> 00:57:25,252
CHRIS: You think a song's going to get better than
that?

1005
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:32,289
SAM: It might! It might. And so I sing (singing):
To everything, Gern, Gern, Gern. There is a

1006
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:42,707
season, Gern, Gern, Gern. I just like to sing your
name, Gern Blanston. Did that help?

1007
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:47,237
CHRIS: Do I have to roll to determine if that was
helpful or not?

1008
00:57:47,237 --> 00:57:48,576
MATT: If you'd like to.

1009
00:57:48,576 --> 00:57:49,495
CHRIS: Certainly.

1010
00:57:49,495 --> 00:57:53,176
MATT: Roll a d20 for musical taste.

1011
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:56,359
CHRIS: Four.

1012
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:59,485
MATT: Four. It catches you by the ear with
delight.

1013
00:57:59,485 --> 00:58:02,912
CHRIS: It's not bad, actually. It's not bad.

1014
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:07,099
MATT: Your general frustration with modern music
is completely bisected by the more oldies,

1015
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:08,846
classical sound of his tune.

1016
00:58:08,846 --> 00:58:13,203
CHRIS: I quite enjoyed how you worked my first
name into that, actually.

1017
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:17,341
No one's ever done that before.

1018
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:19,181
MATT: So you get a d10 inspiration dice.

1019
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:19,994
CHRIS: All right.

1020
00:58:19,994 --> 00:58:24,557
MATT: So just keep that on the side. If ever you
make an attack roll or a saving throw that isn't

1021
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:28,490
as high as you want it to be, you can then roll
that and add the d10 to that roll.

1022
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:29,536
CHRIS: Okay, great.

1023
00:58:29,536 --> 00:58:31,631
MATT: So you just have that in the wings, as you
feel inspired.

1024
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:33,037
TALIESIN: We'll try and remind you if something
affects it.

1025
00:58:33,037 --> 00:58:34,440
CHRIS: Thank you very much. Excellent.

1026
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,746
MATT: All right. That brings it to the elementals'
turn. Now, this flame elemental is going to streak

1027
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:49,422
over (whoosh) to Blern who's-- or, no, sorry, this
is to Fatty Arbuckle. There's too many weird names

1028
00:58:49,422 --> 00:58:52,683
tonight. And this larger fire elemental here is
going to--

1029
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:58,956
CHRIS: Oh, Fatty. He served me well.

1030
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:04,556
SAM: I don't know, he's got a fighting chance. I
love that we were scrambling for d6's when we have

1031
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:07,827
this right in front of us.

1032
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:09,536
CHRIS: Are there any dice around anywhere?

1033
00:59:09,536 --> 00:59:11,041
SAM: Where are we going to find...?

1034
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:12,938
TALIESIN: I'm just waiting for the hand to go in
and just--

1035
00:59:12,938 --> 00:59:16,478
CHRIS: I found this polyhedral vase and I had to
fill it with nine pounds of dice.

1036
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:18,945
TRAVIS: He went the long way.

1037
00:59:18,945 --> 00:59:20,689
MATT: He's not doing anything, he used his whole
round to get there.

1038
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:21,926
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

1039
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:27,356
MATT: But now, as the larger elemental burns into
the center of Scanlan, Percy, you can feel, just

1040
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:33,275
his presence itself is extremely, dangerously hot.
The air around you is blistering. You can feel

1041
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:38,586
your hair curl back in its presence. The small
elemental is going to go ahead and make two

1042
00:59:38,586 --> 00:59:40,751
attacks against Fatty Arbuckle.

1043
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:43,234
CHRIS: Ah, shite.

1044
00:59:43,234 --> 00:59:50,386
MATT: That's going to be a nine to hit. I think
his AC's 13, so I don't think it's going to hit,

1045
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,305
yeah. Second one rolls a one.

1046
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:53,528
SAM: Fatty lives!

1047
00:59:53,528 --> 00:59:55,867
TRAVIS: Fatty just don't want to die.

1048
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:57,508
TALIESIN: Can't keep Fatty down.

1049
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:59,657
LIAM: Bob and weave, Fatty, bob and weave!

1050
00:59:59,657 --> 01:00:09,383
CHRIS: Don't step too hard, Fatty! You
won't be able to take it!

1051
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:14,488
MATT: And with that, Grog, it's your turn. So you
go into your rage at the top of your turn, and

1052
01:00:14,488 --> 01:00:15,776
then what would you like to do?

1053
01:00:15,776 --> 01:00:19,651
TRAVIS: Can I use, I guess, my entire action to
run towards Scanlan?

1054
01:00:19,651 --> 01:00:21,453
MATT: What's your speed again?

1055
01:00:21,453 --> 01:00:22,487
TRAVIS: 50.

1056
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:27,993
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. You can
get right there between Scanlan and this creature

1057
01:00:27,993 --> 01:00:29,326
if you want to.

1058
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,546
TRAVIS: That's about it, huh?

1059
01:00:30,546 --> 01:00:33,188
MATT: I'd say that's your movement. You can move
ten more feet if you want to.

1060
01:00:33,188 --> 01:00:34,518
SAM: You can leap over me.

1061
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:38,054
TRAVIS: Nah, we need to spread out. Can I go back
and arc the other way? Can I run to the left as

1062
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:39,273
far as I can?

1063
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:40,056
MATT: This way?

1064
01:00:40,056 --> 01:00:41,536
TRAVIS: No, from where my starting point was.

1065
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:42,562
MATT: Oh, you mean like this way instead?

1066
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:44,421
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, back towards you, around the
pool.

1067
01:00:44,479 --> 01:00:50,595
MATT: That's about as far as you can get, right
there. If you do not attack anything, you would

1068
01:00:50,595 --> 01:00:51,822
lose your rage.

1069
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:56,629
TRAVIS: I fall out of my rage, yeah. So I fall out
of it. Can I throw something? I guess I can, yeah.

1070
01:00:56,629 --> 01:00:58,116
MATT: You can throw your weapon if you want to.

1071
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:04,917
TRAVIS: Can I attach the Chain of Returning to
Craven Edge? And I'll throw it at trident-less

1072
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:06,758
bastard right there, yeah.

1073
01:01:06,758 --> 01:01:11,898
MATT: Go for it. So you watch as this muscle-bound
goliath comes leaping around the corner as it

1074
01:01:11,898 --> 01:01:15,431
affixes a chain to the edge of its weapon,
flinging a two-handed sword like a giant boomerang and--

1075
01:01:15,431 --> 01:01:17,377
TRAVIS: Only 14.

1076
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:21,126
MATT: 14, against the larger one?

1077
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:22,051
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1078
01:01:22,051 --> 01:01:26,724
MATT: Unfortunately, it makes an impact, but it
just ricochets off of its plated body armor, and

1079
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:30,134
then tumbles to the ground. You can go ahead and
make your--

1080
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:35,086
TRAVIS: Thing to pull it back. Strength. 18.

1081
01:01:35,086 --> 01:01:39,667
MATT: Okay, no problem. You pull it back with the
chain and catch it mid-air. Ending your turn there?

1082
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:41,010
TRAVIS: Keeping my rage.

1083
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,583
MATT: Indeed. Vax, you're up.

1084
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:49,247
LIAM: All right, so I rev up the Boots of Haste
and I'm going to run right next to Vex'ahlia, on

1085
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:53,366
the very edge of the map. And the fire elemental
there's right up against Percy, right?

1086
01:01:53,366 --> 01:01:54,381
MATT: Yep.

1087
01:01:54,381 --> 01:02:04,948
LIAM: All right. I'm going to stab him three times
in his fire buttocks. First one is a 27.

1088
01:02:04,948 --> 01:02:07,274
MATT: That hits.

1089
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:09,005
LIAM: Second one is a 16.

1090
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:10,152
MATT: Hits.

1091
01:02:10,152 --> 01:02:11,631
LIAM: Third is a 14.

1092
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:12,487
MATT: Hits.

1093
01:02:12,487 --> 01:02:23,165
LIAM: Hits, okay. So, first one's sneak attack,
so, shite. An eight-- I'll add that on at the end.

1094
01:02:23,165 --> 01:02:36,013
Here come the dice. Two, four, seven, ten, 16, 21,
27, 28. 28 plus two is 30, 36, for that first with

1095
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:37,223
sneak attack damage.

1096
01:02:37,223 --> 01:02:41,462
MATT: Oof! His form flickers briefly for a moment
from the sheer impact of the dagger hit.

1097
01:02:41,462 --> 01:02:48,287
LIAM: Second dagger does seven, and third swipe
does nine.

1098
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:52,174
MATT: Nine. All righty. The two other daggers
impact, partially passing through its form, not

1099
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:56,466
quite as impactful as the first. That first one
did seemingly cause the creature to have a hard

1100
01:02:56,466 --> 01:03:01,637
time coalescing its fire-wreathed physicality.
That ends your turn, Vax?

1101
01:03:01,637 --> 01:03:02,742
LIAM: Yes.

1102
01:03:02,742 --> 01:03:05,435
MATT: Gern, you're up. So you're right there.

1103
01:03:05,435 --> 01:03:13,581
CHRIS: I'm right there. How far can I run and cast
a spell at the ones around Fatty?

1104
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,648
MATT: 30 feet is how far you can run, and that's
about six squares.

1105
01:03:16,648 --> 01:03:24,806
CHRIS: If I were to cast a bit of-- how about a
Cone of Cold, could I cast a Cone of Cold at the

1106
01:03:24,806 --> 01:03:25,896
fire elementals?

1107
01:03:25,896 --> 01:03:27,541
MATT: You could, you could very much so.

1108
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,248
LIAM: That sounds delightful.

1109
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:33,177
CHRIS: I could cast Ice Storm, but that's a
general malaise of middle-aged couples living in a

1110
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:36,699
neighborhood, becoming aware of their dead-end
lives.

1111
01:03:36,699 --> 01:03:39,381
MATT: All right, so you want to move around here?

1112
01:03:39,381 --> 01:03:44,635
CHRIS: Yes, let's move around that bit right
there. And I'd like to cast Cone of Cold. I might

1113
01:03:44,635 --> 01:03:46,694
unfortunately have to take out Fatty, but--

1114
01:03:46,694 --> 01:03:52,033
MATT: Yeah, there's probably a good chance, this
is not going to be-- After everything else Fatty's

1115
01:03:52,033 --> 01:03:56,749
survived, his own master deals him the possible
finishing blow.

1116
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,752
CHRIS: I feel like I should be the one to do it.

1117
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,207
SAM: Of course.

1118
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:02,254
CHRIS: It's much more humane.

1119
01:04:02,254 --> 01:04:03,402
SAM: It's poetic.

1120
01:04:03,402 --> 01:04:04,542
CHRIS: I think so.

1121
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,013
MARISHA: You brought him into this world.

1122
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:07,843
CHRIS: This is what Fatty would've wanted.

1123
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:14,161
MATT: Everything under that area gets affected. So
yeah, you could do that.

1124
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:19,200
CHRIS: Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine. No
big thing. This old spell? I mean.

1125
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,572
LIAM: Y'all want to go to the DQ and get a cone of
cold?

1126
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:27,306
MATT: What's your spell DC? It should be at the
top of your spell page.

1127
01:04:27,306 --> 01:04:29,279
CHRIS: It is 16.

1128
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,147
MATT: 16, all right. And it is a constitution
save, let's see if they make it. That is a

1129
01:04:33,147 --> 01:04:38,024
failure, a failure, and a failure.

1130
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:41,800
SAM: What about Fatty, did he succeed?

1131
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:49,261
MATT: Oh, I'll roll for Fatty. Fatty does not
succeed. Nope.

1132
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,774
LAURA: It was inevitable.

1133
01:04:50,774 --> 01:04:53,818
MATT: Nope. All right, go ahead and roll 8d8
points of cold damage.

1134
01:04:53,818 --> 01:04:56,520
SAM: Jeez. Oh man, these are not used a lot.

1135
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:04,557
CHRIS: I have four. Let's see, I have a whole--
there's another one here... They're not that easy

1136
01:05:04,557 --> 01:05:09,333
to get to. Two, four, six. I need two more.

1137
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:11,250
SAM: Two more? Good gravy.

1138
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,287
CHRIS: Is this one?

1139
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:13,250
SAM: Yep.

1140
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,559
CHRIS: Here's one, and... D'oh!

1141
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:19,649
LAURA: This is why I sort my dice at the beginning
of the game...

1142
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:23,815
CHRIS: Sorry, it sounded like there was something
coming from the other side of the room.

1143
01:05:23,815 --> 01:05:27,899
SAM: Taliesin, you don't have a d8?

1144
01:05:27,899 --> 01:05:29,661
CHRIS: Do you have a d8 I can borrow?

1145
01:05:29,661 --> 01:05:33,748
TALIESIN: I actually don't. I don't know what
happened to my d8's. I'll buy some at the

1146
01:05:33,748 --> 01:05:35,158
convention tomorrow.

1147
01:05:35,158 --> 01:05:36,555
LAURA: Yay!

1148
01:05:36,555 --> 01:05:42,518
MATT: By the way, guys, if we hit 16k before the
end of tonight's show, we're going to go ahead and

1149
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:44,703
have a sloth come into the studio.

1150
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,985
LAURA: What?!

1151
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,620
MATT and MARISHA: 16K and a sloth!

1152
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,184
MARISHA: I know! I know!

1153
01:05:49,184 --> 01:05:50,272
LAURA: When? When?

1154
01:05:50,272 --> 01:05:51,168
TRAVIS: What?

1155
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:52,085
SAM: An actual sloth?

1156
01:05:52,085 --> 01:05:53,252
LIAM: Is it going to play with us?

1157
01:05:53,252 --> 01:05:54,186
LAURA: Can we hold it?

1158
01:05:54,186 --> 01:05:55,227
TRAVIS: Focus, focus.

1159
01:05:55,227 --> 01:06:00,666
CHRIS: Seven, 14, 21, 27, 31, 34, 38, 44!

1160
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,066
ALL: Oh!

1161
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:04,637
MATT: 44, all...

1162
01:06:04,637 --> 01:06:07,866
LAURA: (mocking Gern's accent) Farty-far pints o'
cald damage!

1163
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:12,957
CHRIS: I don't think I appreciate that very
fucking much! I'm saving all your fucking arses

1164
01:06:12,957 --> 01:06:17,466
out here! For crumb's sake!

1165
01:06:17,466 --> 01:06:28,414
MATT: As he's shouting out at you, releasing this
amazing, condensed blast of pure winter hell in

1166
01:06:28,414 --> 01:06:33,356
front of him, it comes scattering across this way,
freezing the corner of this, turning partially

1167
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:39,548
some of the lava here to stone just by proximity,
blasts past these entities, and as the arcane snow

1168
01:06:39,548 --> 01:06:45,948
comes to rest, you can see the fire elemental here
itself is having a hard time keeping itself

1169
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:49,668
together. Its flame is (whoosh) sputtering and
flickering, barely keeping itself together.

1170
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:57,613
However, by its side you see three very still
frozen-solid statuettes of the remnants of the two

1171
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:02,733
salamanders and Fatty Arbuckle. Taken by the cold
of winter.

1172
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:05,451
MARISHA: Oh, shit. That was awesome.

1173
01:07:05,451 --> 01:07:07,176
SAM: Maybe you can reanimate him.

1174
01:07:07,176 --> 01:07:10,707
CHRIS: It's too late. He's no good any longer.

1175
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:13,303
SAM: Freezer burn?

1176
01:07:13,303 --> 01:07:14,805
CHRIS: Move on. I have.

1177
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:20,496
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of remembering
that, too, put a couple of:

1178
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:25,596
frozen, frozen, and frozen.

1179
01:07:25,596 --> 01:07:27,951
CHRIS: (singing) Let it go, let it go.

1180
01:07:27,951 --> 01:07:35,402
MATT: All right. I believe that ends your turn,
Gern? All right. It would be the salamanders'

1181
01:07:35,402 --> 01:07:42,349
turn, but they're frozen. Damn, they got pummeled.
Vex, you're up.

1182
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:47,017
LAURA: Awesome. Wait, so they can unfreeze? Or are
they basically frozen until something--

1183
01:07:47,017 --> 01:07:48,160
MATT: You don't know.

1184
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:54,371
LAURA: (groans) Okay. That yellow one behind me,
that's Keyleth, right?

1185
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:56,368
MATT: You believe so.

1186
01:07:56,368 --> 01:08:01,415
LAURA: Okay. I know, right? I'm going to flip
backwards like ten feet.

1187
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:03,820
MATT: All right, right behind it.

1188
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:09,224
LAURA: I don't want to be around anybody else, so
I'm going to flip over the lava pit and go out there.

1189
01:08:09,224 --> 01:08:11,595
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an acrobatics
check.

1190
01:08:11,595 --> 01:08:14,799
LIAM: Oh, don't burn your foot. Ooh!

1191
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,880
LAURA: That would be 38.

1192
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:24,582
MATT: Without issue, you land-- not even, no.
Two-point landing, on your feet, knee down, still

1193
01:08:24,582 --> 01:08:30,405
clutching your ready-to-go bow, unscathed by the
boiling cauldron of molten rock.

1194
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:38,214
LAURA: And I Hunter's Mark the guy attacking near
Percy and Scanlan and I shoot two arrows into him.

1195
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:43,315
MATT: Okay, right there. Go for it. Two attacks.

1196
01:08:43,315 --> 01:08:53,683
LAURA: Ugh. Where is my thing? Hold on, sorry.
(giggles)

1197
01:08:53,683 --> 01:08:56,911
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

1198
01:08:56,911 --> 01:08:57,950
LAURA: 21?

1199
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,249
MATT: 21 hits.

1200
01:08:59,249 --> 01:09:00,791
LAURA: And 17.

1201
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:01,770
MATT: Both hit.

1202
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,889
TRAVIS: That's nice.

1203
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:12,239
LAURA: 17 on the first hit.

1204
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,856
MATT: All right.

1205
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:18,104
LAURA: And then 18 on the second hit.

1206
01:09:18,104 --> 01:09:26,578
MATT: Nice! Both arrows burn to ash when they
impact, but the sheer blow and the magical energy

1207
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:31,912
behind it from the bow that you threw it from hit
it and you can see it begin to shake its form even

1208
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:35,004
more, itself. Did you do the Hunter's Mark damage
as well?

1209
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:35,921
LAURA: Yeah.

1210
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,157
MATT: Okay, good. Cool. That end your turn, Vex?

1211
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:39,572
LAURA: Yes.

1212
01:09:39,572 --> 01:09:40,677
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

1213
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,705
MARISHA: Okay. Work with me here.

1214
01:09:43,705 --> 01:09:45,796
MATT: Okay. All right, whatcha got, whatcha
got?

1215
01:09:45,796 --> 01:09:52,239
MARISHA: So here's what I want to do. I want to go
low and dive into that lava pit in front of me.

1216
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,535
SAM: Ooh! Sounds scary.

1217
01:09:54,535 --> 01:10:03,285
MARISHA: And I want to-- using the lava around me
to rise out of the lava and look really scary and

1218
01:10:03,285 --> 01:10:13,133
badass, and then I'm going to shout to the living
elementals, I'm going to be like, hear my warning!

1219
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:23,143
I am your new master! Retreat to the Fire Plane or
meet your imminent demise! This is your last chance.

1220
01:10:23,143 --> 01:10:24,575
SAM: Pretty good. Pretty good.

1221
01:10:24,575 --> 01:10:26,250
TALIESIN: Way better than last time.

1222
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:31,487
MARISHA: Thanks! Thanks, guys. And if you'd like
to meet for coffee later I might be available.

1223
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:37,919
MATT: I'll say, given the use of lava control in
this, they are still elementals, go ahead and

1224
01:10:37,919 --> 01:10:41,151
make a persuasion check. No, intimidate, this
would be intimidate.

1225
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:45,554
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. That's better than my
persuasion. Let's do this one, that one rolled a

1226
01:10:45,554 --> 01:10:50,380
one. Get out of here. Get out of here. 15?

1227
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:59,277
MATT: 15? You can see the smaller elemental here
that just watched its friends get frozen solid, as

1228
01:10:59,277 --> 01:11:06,554
well as whatever that skeleton was, turns towards
you, and (snarls) and begins to make

1229
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,278
its way this direction.

1230
01:11:08,278 --> 01:11:10,150
MARISHA: Away? That's cool.

1231
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:11,501
TRAVIS: Towards the portal.

1232
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:14,310
MATT: Yeah. The large one doesn't seem prominently
fazed by your display.

1233
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,715
MARISHA: Okay. But that one's peacing out? Do I
still have an action?

1234
01:11:18,715 --> 01:11:24,778
MATT: I would say that whole thing of bringing up
the molten rock and the shout and everything would

1235
01:11:24,778 --> 01:11:26,179
be your action.

1236
01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:27,985
TALIESIN: You knocked one off the plank, Keyleth.

1237
01:11:27,985 --> 01:11:29,375
MARISHA: I knocked one off the plank.

1238
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:32,150
MATT: There you go. All right, ends your turn,
Keyleth, brings us to Percy.

1239
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:36,747
TALIESIN: I'm toe to toe with that one right
there, aren't I?

1240
01:11:36,747 --> 01:11:37,995
MATT: Yeah, it's right up in your space.

1241
01:11:37,995 --> 01:11:44,569
TALIESIN: It's in my space. Okay. I'm going to
draw my sword, I'm going to try to do a back and

1242
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:46,466
forth. Let's see how this goes.

1243
01:11:46,466 --> 01:11:47,440
MATT: All right.

1244
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,401
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a swipe at it with my
sword.

1245
01:11:51,401 --> 01:11:53,029
MATT: Go for it.

1246
01:11:53,029 --> 01:11:57,522
TALIESIN: That's a 30. That hits.

1247
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:03,932
MATT: That hits. You take nine points of fire
damage, as just striking it, the flames burst back

1248
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:06,303
and burn towards your face and torso from the
impact.

1249
01:12:06,303 --> 01:12:08,705
MARISHA: Did I put fire resist on you? At the end
of last game?

1250
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:10,967
TALIESIN: Yes, you did! I have fire resist on me.

1251
01:12:10,967 --> 01:12:12,231
MATT: Okay.

1252
01:12:12,231 --> 01:12:13,808
MARISHA: So you take half damage.

1253
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:16,068
TALIESIN: So that's how much? How much fire
damage?

1254
01:12:16,068 --> 01:12:17,652
MATT: That would be four. Four damage.

1255
01:12:17,652 --> 01:12:19,254
TALIESIN: Four damage? Four damage. Four.

1256
01:12:19,254 --> 01:12:22,416
MATT: All right. And roll damage for your strike.

1257
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:26,304
TALIESIN: Ooh! 15 points of damage.

1258
01:12:26,304 --> 01:12:32,517
MATT: Hmm! All right. Do you want to make a second
attack, you said? Or are you just going to keep

1259
01:12:32,517 --> 01:12:36,743
going back and forth, what's your plan? Whatcha
doing? Whatcha doing, Percy?

1260
01:12:36,743 --> 01:12:41,321
TALIESIN: He's being a dick. I'm going to try and
break away and back up, I'm going to try and roll

1261
01:12:41,321 --> 01:12:43,864
away from him to be on the other side of the
rock.

1262
01:12:43,864 --> 01:12:51,686
MATT: Okay. As you roll away, it's going to take
an attack of opportunity at you. That is an 18 to hit?

1263
01:12:51,686 --> 01:12:58,108
TALIESIN: My armor class is 18, but I'm going to
use my shield for plus five to my AC, so that won't hit.

1264
01:12:58,108 --> 01:13:02,075
MATT: Okay, so you use your shield brooch, okay.
As it strikes out towards you, streaking its

1265
01:13:02,075 --> 01:13:05,989
elemental claws outward, you back away, instilling
the power of the brooch, and you see an arcane

1266
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:11,541
shield temporarily ricochets, pushing its claw
away from you. You run away unharmed to the other

1267
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:12,941
side of the rock.

1268
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:16,172
TALIESIN: Instead of going to the other side of
the rock, I'm going to run straight back, and I'm

1269
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:19,628
just going to shoot at it as I run away. I'm going
to make two more shots at it.

1270
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,355
MATT: Go for it.

1271
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:27,300
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to take one more shot,
because I have to reload. That's a 15.

1272
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,935
MATT: 15 hits.

1273
01:13:28,935 --> 01:13:30,773
TALIESIN: Wow! Holy cow.

1274
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,435
MATT: Elementals aren't very hard to hit.

1275
01:13:32,435 --> 01:13:39,973
TALIESIN: No, that was amazing. That's ten points
of damage. And then I reload.

1276
01:13:39,973 --> 01:13:42,602
MATT: All right, and you reload. All right, that
ends Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1277
01:13:42,602 --> 01:13:46,892
SAM: Who's behind me back there, way at the edge
of the map?

1278
01:13:46,892 --> 01:13:48,504
MATT: Over there?

1279
01:13:48,574 --> 01:13:49,917
LAURA: That's Vax.

1280
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:57,611
SAM: That's Vax? Oh, he'll be fine. Okay, I don't
want to be near this thing, probably. Right?

1281
01:13:57,611 --> 01:13:58,975
MATT: That's your call.

1282
01:13:58,975 --> 01:14:02,067
SAM: Okay, I'm going to take a step towards Vax.

1283
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:03,192
MATT: Okay.

1284
01:14:03,192 --> 01:14:11,942
SAM: And away from Gern, right? So is Gern 15 feet
away from me yet, so far?

1285
01:14:11,942 --> 01:14:14,250
MATT: He's 15 feet from you, yeah.

1286
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:20,906
SAM: Okay. So I will then cast Thunderwave, which
should not hit Gern, but will hit Vax.

1287
01:14:20,906 --> 01:14:22,409
MATT: Is that a 15-foot radius?

1288
01:14:22,409 --> 01:14:24,413
SAM: It's a 15-foot cube.

1289
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:27,436
MATT: Cube, so you can just make the cube here,
and it'll hit none of them.

1290
01:14:27,436 --> 01:14:35,812
SAM: Oh! Oh, great. I'll do that. And I'll do it
at level two. Thunderwave.

1291
01:14:35,812 --> 01:14:45,495
MATT: All right, level two Thunderwave. Coming on
up. Oh, it's a self. A 15-foot cube originating

1292
01:14:45,495 --> 01:14:47,303
from you, so yeah, so you can hit that guy.

1293
01:14:47,303 --> 01:14:48,684
SAM: Yeah, originating from me.

1294
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,963
MATT: All right, cool. So, level three, that's
3d8, let's see if it makes its constitution saving

1295
01:14:50,963 --> 01:14:54,273
throw. It does not, not with a natural seven. So
go ahead and roll your damage,

1296
01:14:54,273 --> 01:14:55,940
3d8 thunder damage.

1297
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,414
SAM: Not very much -- Ooh! That's pretty good.
20.

1298
01:14:58,414 --> 01:15:00,174
MARISHA: Nice!

1299
01:15:00,174 --> 01:15:02,487
MATT: 20! How do you want to do this?

1300
01:15:02,487 --> 01:15:05,347
(cheering)

1301
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:07,055
TRAVIS: Scanlan Shorthalt!

1302
01:15:07,055 --> 01:15:14,776
SAM: I send the Thunderwave out by cracking my
knuckles, and as I do so, I do: ahem, Gern,

1303
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,291
might want to check this out.

1304
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:18,430
CHRIS: Oh, I'm looking at something over here.

1305
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,741
SAM: Gern!

1306
01:15:19,741 --> 01:15:21,626
CHRIS: I'll be with you in just a minute, I'm
dealing with something.

1307
01:15:21,626 --> 01:15:23,372
SAM: Gern, I'm doing something really cool here.

1308
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:25,075
CHRIS: I'll be with you in just a minute.

1309
01:15:25,075 --> 01:15:27,801
SAM: Fuck. So I do it anyway but with a scowl on
my face.

1310
01:15:27,801 --> 01:15:29,141
CHRIS: All right, what did I miss?

1311
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:30,050
SAM: Fuck!

1312
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:34,251
CHRIS: Oh, I was just, why didn't you wait? I just
said a minute.

1313
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:36,333
SAM: Oh, forget it, you had to be there.

1314
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:39,077
CHRIS: All right. I was here, but you didn't-- you
should've told me.

1315
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:44,034
MATT: You even missed your own Thunderwave spell,
you were so distracted with your frustration. You

1316
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:47,849
look back, you cracked your knuckles, and it's
gone, but you didn't see it happen and it's a

1317
01:15:47,849 --> 01:15:49,201
little disappointing overall.

1318
01:15:49,201 --> 01:15:50,441
SAM: I kick the dirt.

1319
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:59,039
MATT: All right. You guys look over as this
elemental runs off towards the glowing doorway you

1320
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:05,383
see further down this passage. It's not that far
away from you, but you do see the flickering

1321
01:16:05,383 --> 01:16:10,541
doorway that's like (sputtering). You can see
other entities beginning to step out of it, and you

1322
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:18,957
can see one larger form. It looks fiery, humanoid,
just (crackling) comes out, lower body made of ash

1323
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:20,117
and cinders.

1324
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:24,800
MARISHA: I rush that way and look for my other
tribe. Can I see any of my other tribemates?

1325
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,838
MATT: Make a perception check.

1326
01:16:26,838 --> 01:16:28,533
LIAM: You're running at them.

1327
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:31,820
TRAVIS: So if they're frozen, does that mean
they're dead?

1328
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,823
MATT: You can go find out.

1329
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,166
LAURA: They'll probably melt eventually.

1330
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:37,692
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I walk over there close to
them?

1331
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:40,825
MARISHA: That's better. That one keeps fucking me.
What'd you say? Perception?

1332
01:16:40,825 --> 01:16:41,915
MATT: Yes.

1333
01:16:41,915 --> 01:16:43,044
MARISHA: 26.

1334
01:16:43,044 --> 01:16:45,287
MATT: 26. Currently, from where you stand--

1335
01:16:45,287 --> 01:16:47,051
MARISHA: No, sorry, sorry. 24.

1336
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:51,968
MATT: 24. From where you stand, you can look off
in the distance, you can see parts of the treeline

1337
01:16:51,968 --> 01:16:56,977
across, down the Cindergrove, shifting and moving,
and you hear the distant sounds of combat, but you

1338
01:16:56,977 --> 01:17:00,079
do not have a visual perspective. It looks like
the other teams have not quite made their way to

1339
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:08,335
the center. You're actually the first team to get
here. And you made your way around a possible

1340
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:12,460
encounter, and in doing so, arrived before the
other teams did. However, it looks like a

1341
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:15,646
secondary line of defense is now pouring out of
this doorway.

1342
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:16,991
LAURA: Oh shit.

1343
01:17:16,991 --> 01:17:19,633
TRAVIS: Can I make my way to the two frozen
statue-types?

1344
01:17:19,633 --> 01:17:20,944
MATT: There's three statues, actually.

1345
01:17:20,944 --> 01:17:22,039
TRAVIS: Or three of 'em, yeah.

1346
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:23,357
MATT: Including Fatty Arbuckle.

1347
01:17:23,357 --> 01:17:27,256
TRAVIS: Fatty Arbuckle. Can I make my way over to
one of them and-- should I just

1348
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,533
make sure they're dead?

1349
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:30,325
LAURA: Yeah, just push 'em over, smash them.

1350
01:17:30,325 --> 01:17:32,534
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, can I push Trident-dick over?

1351
01:17:32,534 --> 01:17:37,245
MATT: Yeah. As you shove-- and it's a pretty heavy
form, especially with the ice that's, you know,

1352
01:17:37,245 --> 01:17:38,602
formed around the body--

1353
01:17:38,602 --> 01:17:39,617
TRAVIS: Come on.

1354
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:44,378
MATT: --but not too hard for you, Grog, because
you're Grog. You give a little shove, and as it

1355
01:17:44,378 --> 01:17:47,554
topples over, it just shatters into 100 pieces.

1356
01:17:47,554 --> 01:17:49,472
TRAVIS: Ooh, like the T-1000.

1357
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:51,534
LIAM: What?

1358
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:52,559
TRAVIS: Yeah, I dunno.

1359
01:17:52,559 --> 01:17:53,768
LAURA: Do the other one now.

1360
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:55,524
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, can I go over and do the other
one, like, (giggles).

1361
01:17:55,524 --> 01:17:57,331
MATT: Yeah. This time, you give this one a full
push, this one actually gets

1362
01:17:57,331 --> 01:17:58,696
about ten feet in the air.

1363
01:17:58,696 --> 01:17:59,730
MARISHA: Cow-tipper!

1364
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:04,639
MATT: Before scattering across the ground, pieces
of it actually spilling into the molten lava. And

1365
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:13,530
there stands, frozen in place, Fatty Arbuckle,
chest destroyed, arm limp to the side, just--

1366
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:18,168
TRAVIS: Can I pick him up and walk him back
over to Gern and go: sorry.

1367
01:18:18,168 --> 01:18:23,469
MATT: You see the half-giant goliath
handing you the frozen body

1368
01:18:23,469 --> 01:18:24,787
of your skeletal friend.

1369
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:26,922
CHRIS: Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do
with this, now.

1370
01:18:26,922 --> 01:18:28,178
TRAVIS: You don't want him?

1371
01:18:28,178 --> 01:18:32,038
CHRIS: I mean, he's not very-- maybe we could have
a quick burial.

1372
01:18:32,038 --> 01:18:33,968
LAURA: You could hang a coat on him.

1373
01:18:33,968 --> 01:18:39,380
CHRIS: So we basically would just carry him around
as a coat-rack.

1374
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,919
LIAM: Don't we have company incoming?

1375
01:18:40,919 --> 01:18:44,296
LAURA: We have a Bag of Holding. Oh, there's a
giant monster. I Hunter's Mark it.

1376
01:18:44,296 --> 01:18:45,777
Is it close by?

1377
01:18:45,777 --> 01:18:50,419
MATT: We'll get to that as soon as we come back
from this break. We're going to take a quick

1378
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:55,772
bathroom break and we'll see you guys back here in
about ten minutes or so to continue this next step

1379
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,280
in the adventure.

1380
01:18:57,280 --> 01:34:10,621
[break]

1381
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:16,628
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. Last we left off, the party was

1382
01:34:16,628 --> 01:34:20,801
making their way towards the center of the caldera
where the portal torn open to the fire elemental

1383
01:34:20,867 --> 01:34:26,251
plane resides over a flow of molten rock pouring
in three directions from the center of the

1384
01:34:26,251 --> 01:34:31,276
mountain. Seeing a number of entities swirling
around, and some pouring forth from this open

1385
01:34:31,276 --> 01:34:36,991
doorway, Vox Machina and their current temporary
ally by the traveling dragonborn

1386
01:34:36,991 --> 01:34:45,902
wizard/necromancer/candlemaker named Gern Blanston
have made their way in this direction. Now, before

1387
01:34:45,902 --> 01:34:49,632
we start, just to remind you guys, I guess we're
getting pretty close to 16k subscribers, and when

1388
01:34:49,632 --> 01:34:52,399
we hit 16k something with a sloth is going to
happen.

1389
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:53,759
LAURA: Not tonight, though.

1390
01:34:53,759 --> 01:34:55,388
MATT: No, not, I don't think tonight.

1391
01:34:55,388 --> 01:34:57,009
SAM: We have a sloth on standby.

1392
01:34:57,009 --> 01:35:07,435
MATT: There will be a sloth apparently that will
come here for 16k and a sloth. And if you want to

1393
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:08,850
watch Laura freak out--

1394
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:10,845
LAURA: Ah, so much!

1395
01:35:10,845 --> 01:35:15,789
MATT: Also, we have a giveaway winner for the
evening; ToastKingJr is the winner of

1396
01:35:15,789 --> 01:35:21,532
tonight's Critical Role giveaway, congratulations.
Well done, you, we'll be sending you a lot of fun

1397
01:35:21,532 --> 01:35:23,375
goodies your way very shortly, so--

1398
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:25,263
CHRIS: Our regards to ToastKing senior.

1399
01:35:25,263 --> 01:35:29,100
MATT: Oh yes; well, you've made him proud. Make
sure to let him know. We'll give him a little a

1400
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:37,081
little pipe or something inside too, it'll be
good. All right, so you guys gather yourselves,

1401
01:35:37,081 --> 01:35:41,270
stepping through the battlefield you had just
encountered, the shattered and slowly melting

1402
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:46,466
pieces of ice that once were some of these fire
elemental denizens scattered around your feet, you

1403
01:35:46,466 --> 01:35:51,721
step forward as you see the somewhat human,
somewhat flame-based entity come pouring out of

1404
01:35:51,721 --> 01:35:56,651
the void, surrounded by other elementals, and one
of the other standing salamander general-type

1405
01:35:56,651 --> 01:35:59,242
individuals. You can see--

1406
01:35:59,242 --> 01:36:00,625
MARISHA: This is coming out of the rift?

1407
01:36:00,625 --> 01:36:01,865
MATT: Yes, coming out of the rift.

1408
01:36:01,865 --> 01:36:03,146
LAURA: Is that behind him, is that what the--

1409
01:36:03,146 --> 01:36:04,679
MATT: This is the actual doorway right there.

1410
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:09,313
MARISHA: Oh, and so this is a pool of lava
that they're coming out of?

1411
01:36:09,313 --> 01:36:11,684
MATT: Yes, this is all molten--

1412
01:36:11,684 --> 01:36:14,107
MARISHA: Molten fire plane, more or less?

1413
01:36:14,107 --> 01:36:18,786
MATT: Well, this is actual lava from the inside of
the mountain that has been called forth and

1414
01:36:18,786 --> 01:36:22,148
cracked through the surface, because of the
presence of the tear.

1415
01:36:22,148 --> 01:36:23,459
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

1416
01:36:23,459 --> 01:36:25,431
CHRIS: Probably fine.

1417
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:30,246
TRAVIS: Probably. I don't think this will be bad

1418
01:36:30,246 --> 01:36:33,443
TALIESIN: We did not take a short rest, did we?

1419
01:36:33,443 --> 01:36:36,084
MATT: No, you did not.

1420
01:36:36,084 --> 01:36:39,004
TALIESIN: There has been no time.

1421
01:36:39,004 --> 01:36:54,463
MARISHA: I'm going to, and upon seeing this, drop
my fire elemental form and I say: oh shit, I have

1422
01:36:54,463 --> 01:36:58,862
a feeling this is the 'him' they were talking
about. And I have a feeling he's not going to

1423
01:36:58,862 --> 01:37:03,856
believe that I'm the real new master. So there's
that.

1424
01:37:03,856 --> 01:37:08,941
LAURA: So do some cold stuff, like this guy.

1425
01:37:08,941 --> 01:37:12,280
MATT: I'd like you all to make a stealth check, by
the way, as this is transpiring, and these

1426
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,965
entities are now making--

1427
01:37:13,965 --> 01:37:16,414
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace? Is that still in
effect?

1428
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,161
MATT: No, you cast Hunter's Mark, so the
concentration on that ended,

1429
01:37:18,161 --> 01:37:19,547
unfortunately, sorry.

1430
01:37:19,547 --> 01:37:25,640
CHRIS: 14.

1431
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,026
SAM: 15.

1432
01:37:27,026 --> 01:37:28,016
TALIESIN: 13.

1433
01:37:28,016 --> 01:37:29,495
SAM: Oh wait, with Pass Without a Trace?

1434
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:30,536
MARISHA and LAURA: No.

1435
01:37:30,536 --> 01:37:31,467
MARISHA: 24.

1436
01:37:31,467 --> 01:37:32,420
LIAM: 34.

1437
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,370
LAURA: 22.

1438
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:34,372
TRAVIS: 20.

1439
01:37:34,372 --> 01:37:42,875
MATT: As you guys are all having this
conversation, hushed behind this barricade of

1440
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:49,697
broken tree elements, you can see this salamander
general turn and hiss in that direction, look

1441
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:59,031
over, and point his trident in the direction of
where you all are. You can see the larger fire

1442
01:37:59,031 --> 01:38:05,964
elementals all of a sudden turn their attention
in the direction of the party, as the humanoid

1443
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:11,575
floating about five feet off the ground, his lower
form just this swirl of cinders and black ash,

1444
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:20,326
chuckles with his arms crossed. Points forward,
and the elementals begin moving forward.

1445
01:38:20,326 --> 01:38:24,874
MARISHA: Can Keyleth do a quick ancillary action
before shit happens?

1446
01:38:24,874 --> 01:38:29,355
MATT: Well, this would be the initiative order
now, so everyone roll initiative.

1447
01:38:29,355 --> 01:38:32,483
LIAM: Maybe they see something behind us.

1448
01:38:32,483 --> 01:38:35,894
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1449
01:38:35,894 --> 01:38:40,366
MARISHA: Jesus, sucking it up today.

1450
01:38:40,366 --> 01:38:58,162
MATT: All right, folks, this brings us to 25 to
20?

1451
01:38:58,162 --> 01:38:59,817
LIAM: 20.

1452
01:38:59,817 --> 01:39:01,273
SAM: Hey!

1453
01:39:01,273 --> 01:39:02,910
TRAVIS: Jude.

1454
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:05,361
CHRIS: Don't make it bad.

1455
01:39:05,361 --> 01:39:08,211
TALIESIN: (singing) Take a bad roll...

1456
01:39:08,211 --> 01:39:10,406
MATT: 20 to 15?

1457
01:39:10,406 --> 01:39:11,742
LAURA: 19.

1458
01:39:11,742 --> 01:39:16,855
CHRIS: Yes, I'm 16.

1459
01:39:16,855 --> 01:39:20,122
MATT: 16 for Gern.

1460
01:39:20,122 --> 01:39:22,582
LIAM: ErmahGern!

1461
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:24,249
MATT: 15 to ten?

1462
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:25,465
TALIESIN: 13.

1463
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:30,079
MATT: 13 for Percy. Ten to five?

1464
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:31,980
TRAVIS: Eight.

1465
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,852
MATT: Eight for Grog. Scanlan, what's your--

1466
01:39:34,852 --> 01:39:37,657
SAM: Oh, ten, sorry, ten, ten.

1467
01:39:37,657 --> 01:39:45,940
MATT: So that would be just below you, Percy. All
righty. I believe that's all on that end there.

1468
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:47,148
And that brings us to--

1469
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:50,737
MARISHA: I'm seven, by the way.

1470
01:39:50,737 --> 01:39:52,195
MATT: Oh, seven, thought I got you.

1471
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,244
LAURA: Nobody cares, Marisha.

1472
01:39:54,244 --> 01:39:58,405
MARISHA: I know, I'll just... be back here...
caboose.

1473
01:39:58,405 --> 01:40:09,060
MATT: There we go. So right before Grog is
Keyleth. Great. All right.

1474
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,735
Top of the combat round.

1475
01:40:10,735 --> 01:40:12,559
MARISHA: Yeah, nope. Not leading.

1476
01:40:12,559 --> 01:40:14,495
MATT: All right.

1477
01:40:14,495 --> 01:40:16,217
MARISHA: Shitty initiative roll.

1478
01:40:16,217 --> 01:40:18,199
SAM: It's going to be fine.

1479
01:40:18,199 --> 01:40:22,953
TALIESIN: He's cut things out of cardboard. This
doesn't look fun.

1480
01:40:22,953 --> 01:40:27,329
MARISHA: There was planning. There was a thought
process.

1481
01:40:27,329 --> 01:40:29,496
TRAVIS: Oh shit, towers.

1482
01:40:29,496 --> 01:40:33,799
TALIESIN: There was an instructables involved in this.
This is just really-- we're doomed.

1483
01:40:33,799 --> 01:40:37,758
TRAVIS: No, no, he was down in the play zone
before!

1484
01:40:37,758 --> 01:40:45,763
MATT: Tell me who wants to roll an arcana check as
you see this entity rising up--

1485
01:40:45,763 --> 01:40:47,281
TRAVIS: Oh, absolutely.

1486
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:48,661
SAM: I will, as well.

1487
01:40:48,661 --> 01:40:50,011
MATT: For people who are proficient with it.

1488
01:40:50,011 --> 01:40:51,359
TRAVIS: Two.

1489
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:53,062
SAM: Oh, with disadvantage, right?

1490
01:40:53,062 --> 01:40:54,437
MATT: Yes, you do.

1491
01:40:54,437 --> 01:40:55,759
LIAM: So tired.

1492
01:40:55,759 --> 01:40:57,066
CHRIS: 24.

1493
01:40:57,066 --> 01:41:00,232
TRAVIS: Whoa! Get out of here, dragonborn!

1494
01:41:00,232 --> 01:41:02,195
SAM: Look at the big brain on Gern.

1495
01:41:02,195 --> 01:41:04,372
CHRIS: I'm very smart.

1496
01:41:04,372 --> 01:41:08,840
MATT: (laughs) And as you say that, you recognize
this entity and blurt out its name, just

1497
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:13,744
instinctually as you get a proper view of it. One
of the many denizens of the fire elemental plane,

1498
01:41:13,744 --> 01:41:15,928
this is an efreeti, it is a fire genie.

1499
01:41:15,928 --> 01:41:17,973
SAM: A nefreeti?

1500
01:41:17,973 --> 01:41:23,770
MATT: Efreeti. Yes, the species is efreeti, but an
ee-frit, ee-freet, however you want to pronounce

1501
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:29,008
it, a flame genie, generally hailing from the City
of Brass and/or spaces around and in the fire

1502
01:41:29,008 --> 01:41:30,183
elemental plane.

1503
01:41:30,183 --> 01:41:31,448
TALIESIN: I could feel it from that side.

1504
01:41:31,448 --> 01:41:32,645
LIAM: I was thinking it.

1505
01:41:32,645 --> 01:41:34,518
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, I could feel it.

1506
01:41:34,518 --> 01:41:41,762
MATT: Floats above all of you, arms still crossed,
opens its arms and as it chuckles, both hands just

1507
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:49,086
are engulfed in flames that congeal into these
large fiery balls as it flings them both down in

1508
01:41:49,086 --> 01:41:50,832
the direction of the party.

1509
01:41:50,832 --> 01:41:54,552
TRAVIS: Feel like we're in MegaMan. A MegaMan
boss.

1510
01:41:54,552 --> 01:41:56,434
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah!

1511
01:41:56,434 --> 01:42:00,320
MATT: This is going to be at Scanlan and Vex.

1512
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,601
LAURA: What?!

1513
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:03,345
SAM: These are Fireballs, right?

1514
01:42:03,345 --> 01:42:05,045
MATT: To Scanlan, that is 13?

1515
01:42:05,045 --> 01:42:06,154
SAM: No way.

1516
01:42:06,154 --> 01:42:09,631
MATT: Vex, that is 15.

1517
01:42:09,631 --> 01:42:10,689
LAURA: No!

1518
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:14,403
MATT: Both just (fireball impacts), cracking into
the ground to the sides of where you're standing,

1519
01:42:14,403 --> 01:42:20,283
barely missing them. It keeps glaring down at the
rest of you with a smile. Ending that, it brings

1520
01:42:20,283 --> 01:42:22,854
us to Vax. You're up.

1521
01:42:22,854 --> 01:42:27,603
LIAM: I got a high stealth right beforehand, so am
I hidden at the moment?

1522
01:42:27,603 --> 01:42:31,405
MATT: As far as you know, depending on the
individual. You don't know who saw you

1523
01:42:31,405 --> 01:42:32,622
and who didn't.

1524
01:42:32,622 --> 01:42:38,334
LIAM: As far as I know. All right. Balls. I'm just
going to throw three daggers at the salamander,

1525
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:39,891
right from where I am.

1526
01:42:39,891 --> 01:42:41,765
MATT: Right from where you are? All right.

1527
01:42:41,765 --> 01:42:49,239
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so. First is a 20, second is a
14, third is a 19.

1528
01:42:49,239 --> 01:42:51,966
MATT: Okay. The first one was what?

1529
01:42:51,966 --> 01:42:53,058
LIAM: 20.

1530
01:42:53,058 --> 01:42:56,781
MATT: The first and the third hit. If you are
hidden, though, which you would technically be

1531
01:42:56,781 --> 01:43:00,422
hidden from this individual, you do have advantage
on those attacks, so you can reroll the--

1532
01:43:00,422 --> 01:43:05,512
LIAM: And if I'm hidden it's a surprise, right? On
that guy? You tell me.

1533
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:09,661
MATT: No, no, it's a sneak attack if you're
hidden. A surprise round is if they have no idea

1534
01:43:09,661 --> 01:43:10,876
that you're there.

1535
01:43:10,876 --> 01:43:16,708
LIAM: Okay, I thought it was a-- okay, great!
Fine. Love it. Okay, so.

1536
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:19,956
LAURA: You have advantage, so maybe one of those
would be a 20 if you rerolled them with their

1537
01:43:19,956 --> 01:43:21,505
advantages.

1538
01:43:21,505 --> 01:43:40,735
LIAM: All right. No, and other one, no. So, four,
eight, 12, 13, 16, 20, 31, 35 for the first. And

1539
01:43:40,735 --> 01:43:43,183
the second one is a ten.

1540
01:43:43,183 --> 01:43:45,255
TRAVIS: Kick us off strong!

1541
01:43:45,255 --> 01:43:51,340
MATT: Not bad! Flinging both daggers, one strikes
it square in the sternum and the blade cracks and

1542
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:55,213
pops as it hits the center of the chest. It
(gurgle), you know, it can't make any sound as it

1543
01:43:55,213 --> 01:43:59,420
disappears from the wound, returning to your belt.
The second dagger manages to come towards, it

1544
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:03,036
tries to parry out of the air, but in doing so
just gets it embedded in its forearm and it

1545
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:08,651
shrieks out in pain, as that too vanishes and
appears once again in your belt. Are you going to move,

1546
01:44:08,651 --> 01:44:09,778
or stay where you are?

1547
01:44:09,778 --> 01:44:13,626
LIAM: I'm going to move. I'm going to skip to my
right and stand behind Grog and spank him on the

1548
01:44:13,626 --> 01:44:15,729
ass and say: go get 'em, tiger.

1549
01:44:15,729 --> 01:44:17,612
MATT: "Go get 'em, tiger." Right there. All
righty.

1550
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:19,237
TRAVIS: My name's Grog.

1551
01:44:19,237 --> 01:44:21,507
MATT: Vex, you're up.

1552
01:44:21,507 --> 01:44:28,000
LAURA: Are those trees, do they have any substance
at all, or are they just there to look pretty?

1553
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,434
MATT: I mean, you could get behind them if you
want to, they're maybe about that wide.

1554
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:36,912
LIAM: They're like Charlie Brown Christmas trees?

1555
01:44:36,912 --> 01:44:40,772
MATT: Practically. As far as the Cindergrove's
concerned, they're pretty sad-looking. A lot of them have

1556
01:44:40,772 --> 01:44:42,727
been destroyed and torn and pushed down around.

1557
01:44:42,773 --> 01:44:44,949
LAURA: All right. I'm going to try to use one as
protection. I'm going to hop behind

1558
01:44:44,949 --> 01:44:46,605
the one over this way.

1559
01:44:46,605 --> 01:44:48,469
MATT: This way, here?

1560
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,349
LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark the efreeti.

1561
01:44:50,349 --> 01:44:54,343
MATT: All righty. Mark the efreeti.

1562
01:44:54,343 --> 01:44:57,434
LAURA: And then I'm going to use my Longbow of the
Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to

1563
01:44:57,434 --> 01:44:59,217
shoot him three times!

1564
01:44:59,217 --> 01:45:00,639
MATT: Go for it.

1565
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:05,818
LAURA: That first one probably does not succeed.
It is a 16.

1566
01:45:05,818 --> 01:45:07,467
MATT: That does not hit, nope.

1567
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,690
LAURA: What about 23?

1568
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:10,676
MATT: That does hit.

1569
01:45:10,676 --> 01:45:15,638
LAURA: All right. How about... mega miss. So one
of those hits, because I'm a loser.

1570
01:45:15,638 --> 01:45:22,934
MATT: Streaking past, and the third one hits as
he's holding the flame balls in his hands. Seeing

1571
01:45:22,934 --> 01:45:27,186
the small impact, he just glares at you though the
impact.

1572
01:45:27,186 --> 01:45:30,393
TRAVIS: You need to sacrifice a small mammal.
Maybe we can find a squirrel or something.

1573
01:45:30,393 --> 01:45:31,607
LAURA: 11.

1574
01:45:31,607 --> 01:45:33,564
TRAVIS: A pagan ritual.

1575
01:45:33,564 --> 01:45:35,479
TALIESIN: I can hook you up. I have a kit.

1576
01:45:35,479 --> 01:45:37,725
TRAVIS: (laughter) Why am I not surprised?

1577
01:45:37,725 --> 01:45:40,509
LAURA: 17 points of damage and that's it because I
suck.

1578
01:45:40,509 --> 01:45:44,595
MATT: 17 points of damage. And you are hiding
behind the tree?

1579
01:45:44,595 --> 01:45:46,245
LAURA: I am hiding behind the tree.

1580
01:45:46,245 --> 01:45:49,233
MATT: That's the end of Vex's turn. It is now the
elementals' turns.

1581
01:45:49,233 --> 01:45:51,275
LAURA: These piece-of-shit dice.

1582
01:45:51,275 --> 01:46:00,070
MATT: This is going to move in and actually
consumes the space of Gern and his followers.

1583
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:02,183
TALIESIN: That's not even a figurine, it's just a
chunk of plastic.

1584
01:46:02,183 --> 01:46:07,147
MATT: So as you're sitting there, you just see
this fire elemental just streak around real fast

1585
01:46:07,147 --> 01:46:12,828
and all of a sudden step into the space where you
and your two undead followers are, flames whirling

1586
01:46:12,828 --> 01:46:21,328
around you. All of you immediately take five
points of fire damage, you and your two allies.

1587
01:46:21,328 --> 01:46:25,928
Stimpy and Coral, poor guys.

1588
01:46:25,928 --> 01:46:37,672
CHRIS: Weren't there-- oh, they killed one, that's
right, and you guys fucking killed one, too.

1589
01:46:37,672 --> 01:46:50,380
MATT: With that, it's going to make two strikes
towards you, Gern. The fire elemental rushes in

1590
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:52,221
and just (slithering fire noises).

1591
01:46:52,221 --> 01:46:53,889
CHRIS: Not the vest, not the vest!

1592
01:46:53,889 --> 01:47:00,226
MATT: That is going to be a 13 to hit. What's your
armor class?

1593
01:47:00,226 --> 01:47:01,340
CHRIS: 13.

1594
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:04,442
MATT: Just hits you. And that's a natural 20.

1595
01:47:04,442 --> 01:47:06,629
(sighs and groans)

1596
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:08,568
MATT: So you take 14 points of fire damage from
the first one.

1597
01:47:08,568 --> 01:47:10,435
CHRIS: Doesn't feel very natural.

1598
01:47:10,435 --> 01:47:16,023
LIAM: Thanks for coming, thanks for playing.

1599
01:47:16,023 --> 01:47:26,561
MATT: 19 points of fire damage from the second
strike. And you are currently engulfed in flame.

1600
01:47:26,561 --> 01:47:29,682
You caught fire from the impact with the fire
elemental.

1601
01:47:29,682 --> 01:47:34,500
CHRIS: It doesn't hurt, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm
part dragon.

1602
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,789
LAURA: Do dragonborn have natural fire
resistance?

1603
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:38,427
MATT: Certain ones do, not blue ones.

1604
01:47:38,427 --> 01:47:39,729
LAURA: Oh no!

1605
01:47:39,729 --> 01:47:43,765
CHRIS: If it was lightning, it'd be fine. But no.

1606
01:47:43,765 --> 01:47:58,625
MATT: That ends that elemental's turn. This one is
going to step into the space where both Percy and

1607
01:47:58,625 --> 01:48:02,493
Scanlan are. Both of you guys immediately suffer
seven points of fire damage.

1608
01:48:02,493 --> 01:48:04,563
TALIESIN: I'm halved because I have resistance.

1609
01:48:04,563 --> 01:48:09,756
MATT: Correct, so you'd take three points. And
it's going to make a strike on each of you. That's

1610
01:48:09,756 --> 01:48:14,864
going to be a 14 versus you, Scanlan.

1611
01:48:14,864 --> 01:48:17,255
SAM: That does not hit me.

1612
01:48:17,255 --> 01:48:21,347
MATT: And then versus Percy. Same roll. 14.

1613
01:48:21,347 --> 01:48:24,678
TALIESIN: (laughter) Ah, you're adorable.

1614
01:48:24,678 --> 01:48:29,905
MATT: Misses you both with a series of terrible
attacks. That ends their turn. Gern, you're up. At

1615
01:48:29,905 --> 01:48:31,944
the start of your turn--

1616
01:48:31,944 --> 01:48:33,775
CHRIS: It's my turn.

1617
01:48:33,775 --> 01:48:36,070
TALIESIN: But first you have to take your fire
damage.

1618
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:41,278
CHRIS: Oh, I'm still on fire.

1619
01:48:41,278 --> 01:48:48,529
MATT: Yep. At the top of your turn, because you're
now on fire, you take six points of fire damage.

1620
01:48:48,529 --> 01:48:53,824
You're just wreathed in fire, all around. It's a
bad, bad Sunday for Gern.

1621
01:48:53,824 --> 01:49:05,212
CHRIS: Oh boy. I'm trying to find something that
won't destroy-- How close is everyone to me?

1622
01:49:05,212 --> 01:49:06,553
Everyone's pretty close.

1623
01:49:06,553 --> 01:49:09,289
SAM: No one's near the big guy.

1624
01:49:09,289 --> 01:49:12,261
CHRIS: No, but I'm standing right there.

1625
01:49:12,261 --> 01:49:20,110
TALIESIN: Here, you can see it right here. You're
that little red ring right there, and then your

1626
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:26,563
two followers are right there. If you have
anything that goes in a cube, you'd be fine. Do

1627
01:49:26,563 --> 01:49:28,278
you have anything that's a cube shot?

1628
01:49:28,278 --> 01:49:29,871
CHRIS: And which way am I facing?

1629
01:49:29,871 --> 01:49:31,760
TALIESIN: Whichever way you want to be facing.

1630
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:42,678
CHRIS: I mean, I guess-- I'd like to run around
and throw another Cone of Cold aimed at that guy,

1631
01:49:42,678 --> 01:49:45,488
and then up at the prick hovering above everyone.

1632
01:49:45,488 --> 01:49:46,837
MATT: This direction, you mean?

1633
01:49:46,837 --> 01:49:48,054
CHRIS: Yes. Aye!

1634
01:49:48,054 --> 01:49:54,108
MATT: So you can move around to this side of the
elemental, pushing past your allies, whip around,

1635
01:49:54,108 --> 01:49:59,107
you get a little bit of a view through the fire and
flames swirling around you. You concentrate and

1636
01:49:59,107 --> 01:50:04,401
release a burst of cold energy. It might not be
close enough.

1637
01:50:04,401 --> 01:50:07,057
CHRIS: Of course it is!

1638
01:50:07,057 --> 01:50:12,464
MATT: It'll be enough to get those two there.

1639
01:50:12,464 --> 01:50:15,692
CHRIS: All right, well, I suppose that's better
than nothing at all.

1640
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:17,430
SAM: That's impressive.

1641
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:20,087
MATT: It's better than nothing. All right, so
constitution saves on the elemental.

1642
01:50:20,087 --> 01:50:23,013
What's your DC?

1643
01:50:23,013 --> 01:50:24,376
CHRIS: 16.

1644
01:50:24,376 --> 01:50:32,180
MATT: 16. It fails. On the salamander, that's another
big fail with a 13. So go ahead

1645
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:34,069
and roll 8d8 damage.

1646
01:50:34,069 --> 01:50:51,907
CHRIS: (counting) 40. I'm sorry. What was that
last one? Shit. 35.

1647
01:50:51,907 --> 01:50:57,131
MATT: Nice, 35 points of cold damage to both the
salamander and the elemental in front of you.

1648
01:50:57,131 --> 01:51:05,159
Great. So you see as a blast of winter arcane
energy just skirts forward, casting most of the

1649
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:10,966
dark area here in snow and ice and sleet. You can
see the front of this lava pond is cooled for the

1650
01:51:10,966 --> 01:51:16,516
moment and actually can be walked across
probably for one or two more rounds.

1651
01:51:16,516 --> 01:51:18,272
CHRIS: You're welcome.

1652
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:22,134
LIAM: You're still on fire, by the way.

1653
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:29,420
MATT: Yes, you are also still on fire. Someone
has to take an action to try and douse the

1654
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:34,418
flames on him, whether it be himself or possibly
your allies. You can still give actions to your

1655
01:51:34,418 --> 01:51:35,885
two undead buddies.

1656
01:51:35,885 --> 01:51:45,786
CHRIS: Oh. In that case. I think I'd like to ask
the zombie character, who I believe was-- no,

1657
01:51:45,786 --> 01:51:53,338
Stimpy was the skeleton, this is Coral. I'd like
to have Coral rip-- is my skin on fire, or is it

1658
01:51:53,338 --> 01:51:54,638
just my vest?

1659
01:51:54,638 --> 01:51:58,391
MATT: Both, actually. The scales are starting to
crisp.

1660
01:51:58,391 --> 01:52:00,136
CHRIS: Those are really hard to get!

1661
01:52:00,136 --> 01:52:01,172
SAM: The vest?

1662
01:52:01,172 --> 01:52:02,341
CHRIS: Yes!

1663
01:52:02,341 --> 01:52:07,870
TALIESIN: You could just have them swat you. Like
(zombie grunting noises).

1664
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:16,675
CHRIS: I need to have the zombie hurl its body on
top of me, onto the ground, and roll around on me,

1665
01:52:16,675 --> 01:52:20,034
to get the flame off. It's a very stinky
enterprise.

1666
01:52:20,034 --> 01:52:27,549
MATT: Okay, I'll allow this. You're intentionally
going prone, so you start your next

1667
01:52:27,549 --> 01:52:34,318
combat round on the ground, which means you'll
have half your movement. As Stimpy hobbles over

1668
01:52:34,318 --> 01:52:35,492
(zombie groan).

1669
01:52:35,492 --> 01:52:36,626
SAM: This is Coral.

1670
01:52:36,626 --> 01:52:38,567
CHRIS: Is there like snow or ice on the ground?

1671
01:52:38,567 --> 01:52:40,485
MATT: There is behind the elemental, yes.

1672
01:52:40,485 --> 01:52:42,414
CHRIS: Can he scoop some up?

1673
01:52:42,414 --> 01:52:46,538
MATT: The zombie can take one action,
unfortunately, it's not a super intelligent

1674
01:52:46,538 --> 01:52:48,213
creature. One or the other.

1675
01:52:48,213 --> 01:52:51,875
CHRIS: All right, then, I suppose he just has to
roll on top of me.

1676
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:55,222
MATT: You guys glance over out of the corner of
your eye and you see is the dragonborn all of

1677
01:52:55,222 --> 01:52:59,108
a sudden jumps to the ground, sprawled out, snow
angel style.

1678
01:52:59,108 --> 01:53:04,670
CHRIS: Do it! Just do it already! What are you
waiting for?!

1679
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:09,869
MATT: As this undead begins flailing about on top
of his body. You're starting to get elements of

1680
01:53:09,869 --> 01:53:12,213
decaying goo and--

1681
01:53:12,213 --> 01:53:14,136
CHRIS: Yes, it's fucking terrible!

1682
01:53:14,136 --> 01:53:20,195
MATT: But the flames do eventually go out, over
the next five to six seconds or so. What would you

1683
01:53:20,195 --> 01:53:21,716
like Stimpy to do?

1684
01:53:21,716 --> 01:53:31,195
CHRIS: I mean, I guess-- I would have to give him
a candle, wouldn't I?

1685
01:53:31,195 --> 01:53:32,835
MATT: You would, yes.

1686
01:53:32,835 --> 01:53:40,275
CHRIS: Right. Maybe he just scoops up as much ice
and snow as possible, and attacks the--

1687
01:53:40,275 --> 01:53:42,868
MATT: Sure.

1688
01:53:42,868 --> 01:53:45,222
SAM: Snowball fight?

1689
01:53:45,222 --> 01:53:46,893
CHRIS: Snowball fight.

1690
01:53:46,893 --> 01:53:58,117
MATT: He picks up some of the frost on the ground
with his skeletal hands. Flings it. Funnily

1691
01:53:58,117 --> 01:53:59,599
enough, it hits.

1692
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,151
CHRIS: Fuck yeah, it does.

1693
01:54:01,151 --> 01:54:05,719
MATT: Because it's right there. We'll say for that
particular instance, it takes--

1694
01:54:05,719 --> 01:54:07,666
CHRIS: What, like a hundred points of damage?

1695
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:09,029
MATT: Three points of cold damage.

1696
01:54:09,029 --> 01:54:10,582
(cheers)

1697
01:54:10,582 --> 01:54:17,528
MATT: Immediate steam, in the face of a fire
elemental.

1698
01:54:17,528 --> 01:54:20,228
CHRIS: I smell like cooked cow anus at the
moment.

1699
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:23,603
MATT: Percy, you're up.

1700
01:54:23,603 --> 01:54:29,943
TALIESIN: Weird question, what saving throw does a
creature have to make with your sword?

1701
01:54:29,943 --> 01:54:31,706
TRAVIS: Wisdom.

1702
01:54:31,706 --> 01:54:33,089
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom saving throw?

1703
01:54:33,089 --> 01:54:34,657
MATT: No, it's constitution.

1704
01:54:34,657 --> 01:54:38,088
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. Good to
know.

1705
01:54:38,088 --> 01:54:40,402
TRAVIS: I just answered the first thing that popped
into my head.

1706
01:54:40,402 --> 01:54:46,626
TALIESIN: That was wisdom, fascinating. Okay, I'm
right in the thick of it, aren't it?

1707
01:54:46,626 --> 01:54:47,596
MATT: Yes.

1708
01:54:47,596 --> 01:54:55,856
TALIESIN: I'm going to break away, I'll take the
hit. I don't like attacking these

1709
01:54:55,856 --> 01:54:57,187
things straight on.

1710
01:54:57,187 --> 01:55:03,434
MATT: At the top of your turn, by the way, you
take nine points of fire damage, down to four,

1711
01:55:03,434 --> 01:55:09,004
because you are also engulfed in flame, as is
Scanlan for having passed over the space there.

1712
01:55:09,004 --> 01:55:18,805
TALIESIN: Nine points of fire damage, down to
four. Okay. I'm going to break away and take a run

1713
01:55:18,805 --> 01:55:21,554
for it towards that crater in the far right
corner.

1714
01:55:21,554 --> 01:55:24,039
MATT: This way here?

1715
01:55:24,039 --> 01:55:26,418
TALIESIN: Thank you, yes.

1716
01:55:26,418 --> 01:55:29,966
MATT: Running past the fire elemental, it does get
an attack of opportunity on you, swinging out with

1717
01:55:29,966 --> 01:55:34,862
its flaming appendage. That is going to be a 13 to
hit.

1718
01:55:34,862 --> 01:55:39,580
TALIESIN: That ain't going to hit. That's fine,
I'm going to take my bonus action, and I'm going

1719
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:42,580
to cast Hex on it.

1720
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:44,057
MATT: On which one?

1721
01:55:44,057 --> 01:55:45,840
TALIESIN: On the one I just ran away from.

1722
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,102
MATT: Okay, that elemental is now currently Hexed.

1723
01:55:49,102 --> 01:55:51,721
TALIESIN: With a disadvantage on constitution
saving throws.

1724
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:53,167
MATT: Oh, okay!

1725
01:55:53,167 --> 01:55:54,802
TRAVIS: Hey!

1726
01:55:54,802 --> 01:55:56,856
TALIESIN: Teamwork!

1727
01:55:56,856 --> 01:56:00,030
TRAVIS: I don't think he has any blood, though.

1728
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:01,897
MATT: Is it saving throws, or is it ability
checks?

1729
01:56:01,897 --> 01:56:03,315
TALIESIN: Ability checks.

1730
01:56:03,315 --> 01:56:04,800
MATT: That does not affect saving throws,
unfortunately.

1731
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,271
TALIESIN: God damn it. All right, never mind.
That's fine. Since I've broken off from him, I'm

1732
01:56:08,271 --> 01:56:11,656
going to take some shots at him anyway. I'll take
three shots.

1733
01:56:11,656 --> 01:56:14,006
MATT: Go for it.

1734
01:56:14,006 --> 01:56:17,005
TALIESIN: First one is an 18.

1735
01:56:17,005 --> 01:56:18,690
MATT: 18 hits.

1736
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:30,648
TALIESIN: That's seven points of damage. Second
one's a sharpshooter. That's 25.

1737
01:56:30,648 --> 01:56:35,219
MATT: 25. And with that shot (boom).

1738
01:56:35,219 --> 01:56:37,316
(cheering)

1739
01:56:37,316 --> 01:56:40,382
TRAVIS: Jeez, leave some for the rest of us, big
boy.

1740
01:56:40,382 --> 01:56:42,015
MARISHA: Oh, wait, why did it go back?

1741
01:56:42,015 --> 01:56:45,555
MATT: Sorry, this is the one that took all the
damage from the Cone of Cold, so this one is still

1742
01:56:45,555 --> 01:56:48,266
fine. Robbed you of victory!

1743
01:56:48,266 --> 01:56:51,709
CHRIS: That was so weird, he disappeared for a
moment and then came right back!

1744
01:56:51,709 --> 01:56:53,464
TALIESIN: I haven't actually damaged him yet, have
I?

1745
01:56:53,464 --> 01:56:54,691
MATT: You did seven damage.

1746
01:56:54,691 --> 01:56:57,899
TALIESIN: That was the first damage. The second
damage I haven't done yet.

1747
01:56:57,899 --> 01:56:59,427
MATT: No, you have not.

1748
01:56:59,427 --> 01:57:02,051
TALIESIN: 20 points of damage.

1749
01:57:02,051 --> 01:57:06,684
MATT: All right, nice. You're adding your Hexes to
this, right?

1750
01:57:06,684 --> 01:57:08,256
TALIESIN: No, I'm not! Oh, shit.

1751
01:57:08,256 --> 01:57:09,825
MATT: Add d6 to each of these, buddy.

1752
01:57:09,825 --> 01:57:17,641
TALIESIN: So that's six extra points, and that's
seven extra points total. Third sharpshooter shot.

1753
01:57:17,641 --> 01:57:24,281
Thank you for reminding me on the Hex. That's a
12, that's going to miss.

1754
01:57:24,281 --> 01:57:28,418
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately. You shoot too far.
It actually separates its body for a second, the

1755
01:57:28,418 --> 01:57:32,630
flames flickering away from the impact of the
bullet, passing through, no effect,

1756
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:34,012
unfortunately.

1757
01:57:34,012 --> 01:57:38,505
TALIESIN: Weird thing. Can I spend an action surge
and put myself out of the fire?

1758
01:57:38,505 --> 01:57:39,861
MATT: You can.

1759
01:57:39,861 --> 01:57:41,875
TALIESIN: You know what, it's just fire. I will be
on fire.

1760
01:57:41,875 --> 01:57:43,660
MATT: You will be on fire, Percy.

1761
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:44,985
TALIESIN: I'm going to be on fire.

1762
01:57:44,985 --> 01:57:46,420
MARISHA: It's just fire.

1763
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,666
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

1764
01:57:47,666 --> 01:57:52,693
SAM: What is holding the thing that's floating in
the sky aloft? Is he flying? Is he supported on a

1765
01:57:52,693 --> 01:57:54,659
column of fire?

1766
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:57,343
CHRIS: No, he's brought a plastic shelf with
himself, apparently.

1767
01:57:57,343 --> 01:57:59,208
SAM: Oh, of course.

1768
01:57:59,208 --> 01:58:00,623
CHRIS: He's just standing on it.

1769
01:58:00,623 --> 01:58:02,372
MATT: It's Ikea-made, you just have to build it.

1770
01:58:02,372 --> 01:58:03,904
TRAVIS: It's the "schlogel."

1771
01:58:03,904 --> 01:58:08,172
MATT: It appears to be flying. The very essence of
this creature is partial flame and magic, and it's

1772
01:58:08,172 --> 01:58:14,265
levitating as its lower form is a tiny dervish
whirlwind of black ash and flame.

1773
01:58:14,265 --> 01:58:19,877
SAM: And he's a larger creature or smaller?

1774
01:58:19,877 --> 01:58:21,091
MATT: Large.

1775
01:58:21,091 --> 01:58:30,150
SAM: He's a large creature or smaller. Okay. I'm
going to make him the boy in the bubble. I will

1776
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:33,459
cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

1777
01:58:33,459 --> 01:58:34,824
TALIESIN: Yay!

1778
01:58:34,824 --> 01:58:36,332
MARISHA: What is that?

1779
01:58:36,332 --> 01:58:39,114
SAM: I'm going to make a bubble around him.

1780
01:58:39,114 --> 01:58:42,136
MATT: First you take four points of fire damage,
because you're on fire.

1781
01:58:42,136 --> 01:58:48,421
SAM: Oh, sure, whatever. No, wait, but it was
nine, right? You said? Just four?

1782
01:58:48,421 --> 01:58:51,730
MATT: That was when it originally got to you, and
then you're still burning every turn until you put

1783
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:55,422
yourself out. The range on the resilient sphere is
30 feet, so you're going to want to get closer to

1784
01:58:55,422 --> 01:58:56,437
cast it.

1785
01:58:56,437 --> 01:58:58,699
SAM: Oh, okay. I'll walk. He's going to hit me,
isn't he?

1786
01:58:58,699 --> 01:59:03,424
MATT: This is cool, currently, if you want to go
across. You can get there, and that'll be enough

1787
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,459
distance.

1788
01:59:04,459 --> 01:59:08,381
SAM: I'll do that, and then straight up in the
air.

1789
01:59:08,381 --> 01:59:17,615
MATT: Okay, so it has to make a dexterity saving
throw. What's the DC? The DC on your spells is a

1790
01:59:17,615 --> 01:59:19,510
20 right now, right?

1791
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:20,520
SAM: It is.

1792
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:21,493
TALIESIN: Wow.

1793
01:59:21,493 --> 01:59:23,275
MATT: And it rolled a 19. 18 plus one.

1794
01:59:23,275 --> 01:59:25,027
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

1795
01:59:25,027 --> 01:59:29,576
MATT: And, with that, suddenly you guys see
Scanlan concentrate, shouting the magical

1796
01:59:29,576 --> 01:59:31,303
incantation through the hand cone--

1797
01:59:31,303 --> 01:59:34,028
SAM: You're in a ball, motherfucker!

1798
01:59:34,028 --> 01:59:44,502
MATT: You see a pink-purple-hued globe of
crystalline, magical arcane energy just form

1799
01:59:44,502 --> 01:59:54,301
around the creature, and the efreet goes
(grunting).

1800
01:59:54,301 --> 01:59:57,825
SAM: Does he fall, or can he continue to fly?

1801
01:59:57,825 --> 02:00:03,016
MATT: The sphere is weightless, so no, he stays
where he is.

1802
02:00:03,016 --> 02:00:05,902
LIAM: And is it a good witch, or a bad witch?

1803
02:00:05,902 --> 02:00:13,262
TALIESIN: Science check. Does oxygen penetrate the
sphere?

1804
02:00:13,262 --> 02:00:14,927
SAM: There is still air inside.

1805
02:00:14,927 --> 02:00:17,417
TALIESIN: Damn it. Because that would've been
amazing if he just died.

1806
02:00:17,417 --> 02:00:19,161
CHRIS: I was looking away, what just happened?

1807
02:00:19,161 --> 02:00:20,157
SAM: Oh, fuck!

1808
02:00:20,157 --> 02:00:21,081
CHRIS: What?

1809
02:00:21,081 --> 02:00:22,247
SAM: Always look at me!

1810
02:00:22,247 --> 02:00:26,627
CHRIS: Oh, I was looking at some grubs over by
the--

1811
02:00:26,627 --> 02:00:27,661
TRAVIS: Grubs?

1812
02:00:27,661 --> 02:00:28,640
CHRIS: I'm hungry.

1813
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:37,411
SAM: Oh, and I'll turn around and I will heal
Gern, because he's not doing great. With my bonus

1814
02:00:37,411 --> 02:00:43,879
action, at a second level, I will cast Healing Word,
and I will sing to him again, because he loves it

1815
02:00:43,879 --> 02:00:44,990
so much.

1816
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:47,452
CHRIS: You know, I think I'm fine with 26 hit
points.

1817
02:00:47,452 --> 02:00:53,523
SAM: (singing) Gern, baby, Gern! Candle inferno!
Gern, baby, Gern! Burn that mother down!

1818
02:00:53,523 --> 02:00:59,210
MATT: All right. Second level, that's 2d4 plus--

1819
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:00,366
SAM: Five.

1820
02:01:00,366 --> 02:01:01,712
MATT: 2d4 plus five you heal.

1821
02:01:01,712 --> 02:01:03,887
CHRIS: Oh, do I roll that?

1822
02:01:03,887 --> 02:01:05,224
SAM: Do I roll, or does he?

1823
02:01:05,224 --> 02:01:06,567
MATT: Whichever one. Doesn't matter to me.

1824
02:01:06,567 --> 02:01:14,046
CHRIS: Okay, so nine.

1825
02:01:14,046 --> 02:01:18,411
MATT: All right. Scanlan, I believe that ends your
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1826
02:01:18,411 --> 02:01:24,935
CHRIS: Thank you. I will never again not watch
your spellcasting! You tiny bundle of adorable

1827
02:01:24,935 --> 02:01:26,420
creature!

1828
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:34,985
MARISHA: Is that guy and that guy within 30 feet
of each other? It's hard to tell with the thing on it.

1829
02:01:34,985 --> 02:01:39,250
MATT: There is 30 feet between them, yes.

1830
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:44,451
MARISHA: A 30 foot long spell could hit both of
them, correct?

1831
02:01:44,451 --> 02:01:52,495
MATT: A 30 foot long spell could-- It could only
hit one. It's 30 feet between them.

1832
02:01:52,495 --> 02:02:00,586
MARISHA: Okay. But this guy-- oh, damn it. What
about this guy and this guy? They're within 30

1833
02:02:00,586 --> 02:02:02,108
feet, right?

1834
02:02:02,108 --> 02:02:07,993
MATT: 35 between them. These two, there is
definitely.

1835
02:02:07,993 --> 02:02:19,691
MARISHA: Actually, yeah, let me do that. I am
going to cast a Tidal Wave right here and I'm

1836
02:02:19,691 --> 02:02:28,337
going to go outward in this direction, and it's
ten foot wide and 30 foot long, so let me back up

1837
02:02:28,337 --> 02:02:29,768
a little bit out of it.

1838
02:02:29,768 --> 02:02:31,787
MATT: So it's ten feet wide, and it'll go (rushing
water) like that, you mean?

1839
02:02:31,787 --> 02:02:32,752
MARISHA: Yeah.

1840
02:02:32,752 --> 02:02:34,254
MATT: Okay, so you back up to there?

1841
02:02:34,254 --> 02:02:35,340
MARISHA: Yes.

1842
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:42,736
MATT: All right. Okay, dexterity save on each of
them. Dexterity save on the first one.

1843
02:02:42,736 --> 02:02:46,488
MARISHA: Since it's water, do they have
disadvantage?

1844
02:02:46,488 --> 02:02:55,373
MATT: No, not for the saving throw. The first one
does make the saving throw, however, that is a 19

1845
02:02:55,373 --> 02:03:02,370
plus three, so 22. On a success, it takes half as
much damage and isn't knocked prone, so it takes

1846
02:03:02,370 --> 02:03:04,521
half. The other one, however, does fail.

1847
02:03:04,521 --> 02:03:06,756
MARISHA: Do they take more damage because it's
water?

1848
02:03:06,756 --> 02:03:08,877
MATT: How much is in the spell?

1849
02:03:08,877 --> 02:03:10,414
MARISHA: It does 4d8 damage.

1850
02:03:10,414 --> 02:03:12,561
MATT: Right, go ahead and roll that. I'd say, how
many gallons would that be?

1851
02:03:12,561 --> 02:03:14,335
That's a shit-ton of gallons.

1852
02:03:14,335 --> 02:03:25,996
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. 12 plus eight is 20,
plus another eight is 28. Math.

1853
02:03:25,996 --> 02:03:28,961
TALIESIN: That's a d8 there.

1854
02:03:28,961 --> 02:03:39,605
MATT: 14. Okay, so that's 14 and 28. I'd say that
Tidal Wave, how many gallons of water would we say

1855
02:03:39,605 --> 02:03:40,905
each one of those is?

1856
02:03:40,905 --> 02:03:42,318
MARISHA: It's 30 foot tall.

1857
02:03:42,318 --> 02:03:45,013
MATT: Well, it's ten foot tall, ten foot wide, so
that's...

1858
02:03:45,013 --> 02:03:48,149
MARISHA: And 30 feet long.

1859
02:03:48,149 --> 02:03:51,593
TALIESIN: Four gallons, easily.

1860
02:03:51,593 --> 02:03:55,182
MATT: I'd say we're looking at close to 50 gallons
of water, right?

1861
02:03:55,182 --> 02:03:57,467
TALIESIN: Probably way more than 50 gallons.

1862
02:03:57,467 --> 02:03:59,294
LAURA: That's a lot of gallons, for sure.

1863
02:03:59,294 --> 02:04:00,769
CHRIS: I think it's like a million gallons.

1864
02:04:00,769 --> 02:04:03,001
SAM: Somewhere between 50 and a million.

1865
02:04:03,001 --> 02:04:05,360
MARISHA: Why didn't we switch to metric?

1866
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:07,265
TALIESIN: It would be a few hundred gallons of
water.

1867
02:04:07,265 --> 02:04:13,496
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, for the
width of it and the space you had to pass it

1868
02:04:13,496 --> 02:04:19,508
through, we'll say roughly 60 gallons of water
passes through each of these elementals. Water

1869
02:04:19,508 --> 02:04:23,119
susceptibility, for every five feet the elemental
moves in water, or for every gallon of water

1870
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:27,658
splashed on it, it takes one point of cold damage,
so they both take an additional 60 points of

1871
02:04:27,658 --> 02:04:33,338
damage. Which destroys both of the elementals.

1872
02:04:33,338 --> 02:04:36,535
LAURA: Fuck yeah! Do that again, Keyleth!

1873
02:04:36,535 --> 02:04:37,869
MARISHA: Okay, I will!

1874
02:04:37,869 --> 02:04:39,414
TALIESIN: Again, again!

1875
02:04:39,414 --> 02:04:43,964
MATT: So Keyleth, you have more movement still, if
you want to move somewhere.

1876
02:04:43,964 --> 02:04:50,731
MARISHA: Oh! I'll scootch up a bit, start moving
towards...

1877
02:04:50,731 --> 02:04:52,331
MATT: There?

1878
02:04:52,331 --> 02:04:53,641
MARISHA: That's good, that works.

1879
02:04:53,641 --> 02:04:56,938
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Grog, you're up.

1880
02:04:56,938 --> 02:05:03,519
TRAVIS: I would like to rush up where Scanlan is,
and attack that little guy on the ground there.

1881
02:05:03,519 --> 02:05:04,668
MATT: Right there?

1882
02:05:04,668 --> 02:05:06,199
SAM: I'm the little guy on the ground.

1883
02:05:06,199 --> 02:05:11,441
TRAVIS: No, not you, the other guy that's next to
him. And can I use a reckless attack--

1884
02:05:11,441 --> 02:05:13,689
MATT: Are you raging first, or are you--

1885
02:05:13,689 --> 02:05:19,395
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, raging. I would like to rage. And
then use reckless attack against him!

1886
02:05:19,395 --> 02:05:21,732
MATT: All right, so you got two attacks, reckless
attack.

1887
02:05:21,732 --> 02:05:25,697
TRAVIS: 24?

1888
02:05:25,697 --> 02:05:27,302
MATT: 24 hits.

1889
02:05:27,302 --> 02:05:31,227
TRAVIS: 23.

1890
02:05:31,227 --> 02:05:32,503
MATT: 23 hits.

1891
02:05:32,503 --> 02:05:39,217
TRAVIS: Awesome. 18 on the first one.

1892
02:05:39,217 --> 02:05:40,462
MATT: Nice.

1893
02:05:40,462 --> 02:05:46,995
TRAVIS: And 23.

1894
02:05:46,995 --> 02:05:52,487
MATT: 23, nice. All right, so as you rush past,
looking over at the cooled rock that's starting to

1895
02:05:52,487 --> 02:05:57,472
crack, and bits of steam vents are starting to
push through underneath your feet, Scanlan. The

1896
02:05:57,472 --> 02:06:00,460
area you're standing on isn't very sturdy, you're
probably going to want to move pretty soon.

1897
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:08,088
However, you see this barreling form of pure anger
and blade come rushing past as Grog slams into the

1898
02:06:08,088 --> 02:06:15,543
salamander twice with his blade. That fails first
constitution, and fails second. So you gain plus

1899
02:06:15,543 --> 02:06:18,574
two strength, salamander loses two strength.

1900
02:06:18,574 --> 02:06:19,974
TRAVIS: Yes.

1901
02:06:19,974 --> 02:06:31,633
MATT: However, because you've taken... With each
strike within melee of the salamander's heated

1902
02:06:31,633 --> 02:06:38,068
body, it's so intense by its proximity that you
suffer six points of fire damage from the first

1903
02:06:38,068 --> 02:06:39,402
melee attack against you.

1904
02:06:39,402 --> 02:06:41,039
TRAVIS: She gave me resistance, so halved to
three?

1905
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:42,021
MATT: Halved to two.

1906
02:06:42,021 --> 02:06:43,042
TRAVIS: Halved to two.

1907
02:06:43,042 --> 02:06:45,738
MATT: The other one would be 12, so you take six.

1908
02:06:45,738 --> 02:06:46,914
TRAVIS: Eight total.

1909
02:06:46,914 --> 02:06:53,442
MATT: Total of eight fire damage just from
slamming and attacking this salamander. All

1910
02:06:53,442 --> 02:07:00,140
righty, that brings us to the very end. It is now
the salamander's turn. After being hacked twice by

1911
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:06,865
you, Grog, it turns around, takes its trident in
both hands, looks at you with this horrible snarl.

1912
02:07:06,865 --> 02:07:13,187
You can see now these glistening, almost ruby-like
sharp teeth in its wide grin. (snarl) These long

1913
02:07:13,187 --> 02:07:19,647
catfish-like tendrils that waft off its face as it
slams down the spear towards you.

1914
02:07:19,647 --> 02:07:21,734
TRAVIS: Oh, you brought a fork to a sword fight.

1915
02:07:21,734 --> 02:07:26,426
MATT: That is going to be a 23 to hit.

1916
02:07:26,426 --> 02:07:27,871
TRAVIS: Oh shit, that hits.

1917
02:07:27,871 --> 02:07:32,394
MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage.

1918
02:07:32,394 --> 02:07:33,444
TRAVIS: Halved.

1919
02:07:33,444 --> 02:07:39,188
MATT: Halved to six. And it's going to also turn
around and its tail, its long snake tail (whoosh)

1920
02:07:39,188 --> 02:07:43,583
whips you. That is going to be an 18 to hit.

1921
02:07:43,583 --> 02:07:45,217
TRAVIS: That misses!

1922
02:07:45,217 --> 02:07:49,634
MATT: It misses, all righty. The tail comes
towards you, and you knock it out of the way with

1923
02:07:49,634 --> 02:07:56,395
Craven Edge. That will end its turn. Top of the
round, I'm going to make a roll for the

1924
02:07:56,395 --> 02:08:04,075
consistency of the currently cooled lava pool. It
maintains. However, you feel your

1925
02:08:04,075 --> 02:08:05,713
feet cracking beneath--

1926
02:08:05,713 --> 02:08:07,203
SAM: I think I'll stay.

1927
02:08:07,203 --> 02:08:11,454
TRAVIS: Feels nice here. Maybe a timeshare.

1928
02:08:11,454 --> 02:08:17,280
MATT: This efreet-- let me look at the logistics
of this spell now, because--

1929
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,025
TRAVIS: It's pissed off in a ball.

1930
02:08:20,025 --> 02:08:21,607
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, this spell is awful.

1931
02:08:21,607 --> 02:08:23,409
SAM: It can't do anything.

1932
02:08:23,409 --> 02:08:25,938
MATT: It is enclosed for the duration, up to a
minute.

1933
02:08:25,938 --> 02:08:31,825
LIAM: Sorry, Matt. Sorry, Matt.

1934
02:08:31,825 --> 02:08:34,395
TRAVIS: He's like, first the beholder, now my
flame genie.

1935
02:08:34,395 --> 02:08:38,361
MATT: It's pushing against, and it takes these two
flame balls it conjures and throws them out

1936
02:08:38,361 --> 02:08:42,226
towards you guys. They just go (impacts) against
the sphere and then go out, and it's just

1937
02:08:42,226 --> 02:08:47,214
(growling). It's really, really pissed off. It
can't do anything.

1938
02:08:47,214 --> 02:08:51,307
CHRIS: (singing) Like a genie in a bottle. Got to
rub me the right way.

1939
02:08:51,307 --> 02:08:55,078
LIAM: Can we all collectively look up at him, look
sad, and go, aw.

1940
02:08:55,078 --> 02:08:58,996
TALIESIN: I'm looking forward to rolling it back
through the rift.

1941
02:08:58,996 --> 02:09:03,459
MARISHA: Oh my god, can we do that? Like a hamster
ball.

1942
02:09:03,459 --> 02:09:10,657
MATT: All right. Ending its turn, because it can't
do anything, Vax, you're up.

1943
02:09:10,657 --> 02:09:18,985
LIAM: All right, I'm going to scoot up right in
front of Keyleth on the edge of the frozen-over

1944
02:09:18,985 --> 02:09:23,432
pool of lava, but I'm not going to stand on it.
And I'm going to chuck three daggers at the

1945
02:09:23,432 --> 02:09:25,225
salamander in front of Grog.

1946
02:09:25,225 --> 02:09:26,636
MATT: Okay. Right there, about?

1947
02:09:26,636 --> 02:09:32,082
LIAM: Right in front of her. Between her and the--
yeah. There. One, two, three to the salamander.

1948
02:09:32,082 --> 02:09:33,490
MATT: Go for it.

1949
02:09:33,490 --> 02:09:43,219
LIAM: 21. Then 25. And then 21.

1950
02:09:43,219 --> 02:09:46,291
MATT: Okay, all three hit.

1951
02:09:46,291 --> 02:09:51,568
LIAM: All right, and because he's flanked by Grog,
the first one gets sneak attack damage. Two plus

1952
02:09:51,568 --> 02:10:02,988
eight, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 31 for the first.

1953
02:10:02,988 --> 02:10:04,131
MATT: Nice.

1954
02:10:04,131 --> 02:10:09,456
LIAM: And then ten for the second and eight for
the third.

1955
02:10:09,456 --> 02:10:16,069
MATT: All right. Good to know. (whoosh) As you
jump in front of the way of Keyleth, you unleash

1956
02:10:16,069 --> 02:10:21,699
all three daggers in rapid succession, each one
finding its mark (impacts) into the body of the

1957
02:10:21,699 --> 02:10:27,427
now profusely bleeding salamander. You can see now
streaks of its own blood are pouring down, boiling

1958
02:10:27,427 --> 02:10:31,665
on contact with air, the significant difference in
temperature from the exterior and its actual

1959
02:10:31,665 --> 02:10:35,734
interior body causing it to change from a liquid
to a gas.

1960
02:10:35,734 --> 02:10:37,337
TRAVIS: That's our rogue.

1961
02:10:37,337 --> 02:10:38,481
MATT: End your turn?

1962
02:10:38,481 --> 02:10:41,342
LIAM: I look over my shoulder at Keyleth like a
dumb schmuck for a second, and then back at the

1963
02:10:41,342 --> 02:10:42,456
salamander.

1964
02:10:42,456 --> 02:10:44,766
MATT: Okay. Vex, you're up.

1965
02:10:44,766 --> 02:10:47,921
LAURA: Okay. Am I hiding? Am I hidden?

1966
02:10:47,921 --> 02:10:57,928
MATT: You can roll a stealth check. A hide action
is a hide action. As a rogue, do you have the--

1967
02:10:57,928 --> 02:11:00,666
LAURA: What is that number?

1968
02:11:00,666 --> 02:11:04,038
MATT: I don't know what number that is.

1969
02:11:04,038 --> 02:11:06,510
LAURA: It's completely smooshed off of the dice!

1970
02:11:06,510 --> 02:11:08,488
LIAM: That means that existence is about to end.

1971
02:11:08,488 --> 02:11:10,138
LAURA: There's literally--

1972
02:11:10,138 --> 02:11:12,738
LIAM: Just roll this. Roll another one.

1973
02:11:12,738 --> 02:11:17,992
MATT: Technically, you do not have cunning action
yet, that's a 2nd-level rogue ability, so you

1974
02:11:17,992 --> 02:11:19,245
would use your action to hide.

1975
02:11:19,245 --> 02:11:21,379
LAURA: But I had my skirmisher stealth.

1976
02:11:21,379 --> 02:11:24,884
MATT: If you go from hide to hide you can do that,
but you are not hidden at the

1977
02:11:24,884 --> 02:11:26,373
beginning of the round.

1978
02:11:26,373 --> 02:11:29,167
LIAM: It's a rookie rogue mistake. It happens in
the beginning.

1979
02:11:29,167 --> 02:11:31,666
LAURA: Yeah. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. All
right, then I'm just going to...

1980
02:11:31,666 --> 02:11:34,196
LIAM: At the higher levels you mess up the
assassinate thing.

1981
02:11:34,196 --> 02:11:40,622
LAURA: Everything's a concentration thing, so I'm
just going to lightning arrow the giant fire guy.

1982
02:11:40,622 --> 02:11:41,528
MATT: Right there?

1983
02:11:41,528 --> 02:11:42,354
LAURA: Yeah.

1984
02:11:42,354 --> 02:11:43,624
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack.

1985
02:11:43,624 --> 02:11:48,832
LAURA: Okay. 30!

1986
02:11:48,832 --> 02:11:50,712
MATT: That'll hit.

1987
02:11:50,712 --> 02:11:52,474
SAM: That'll hit anything.

1988
02:11:52,474 --> 02:11:57,977
LIAM: She just hit a sparrow on a paraglider.

1989
02:11:57,977 --> 02:12:00,013
LAURA: That's 4d8 lightning damage on a hit.

1990
02:12:00,013 --> 02:12:02,356
MATT: Correct, yep.

1991
02:12:02,356 --> 02:12:11,693
LIAM: Oh. Well, half good, half bad.

1992
02:12:11,693 --> 02:12:15,663
LAURA: 18. That's it.

1993
02:12:15,663 --> 02:12:17,326
MATT: 18 points of lightning damage?

1994
02:12:17,326 --> 02:12:18,329
LAURA: Yeah.

1995
02:12:18,329 --> 02:12:21,675
MATT: All right. So as you turn around the side of
the tree, releasing the arrow. As it goes through

1996
02:12:21,675 --> 02:12:26,583
the air, streaking, it suddenly bursts into an
arcing bit of energy (crackling energy), a bolt of

1997
02:12:26,583 --> 02:12:31,563
lightning that strikes into and begins to spill
around the insides of the elemental. You can see

1998
02:12:31,563 --> 02:12:34,126
it shakes it off as the energy disperses.

1999
02:12:34,126 --> 02:12:39,635
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to
hide then, with the skirmisher's thing. For my

2000
02:12:39,635 --> 02:12:41,828
skirmisher stealth, I can use a bonus action to
hide.

2001
02:12:41,828 --> 02:12:45,028
MATT: I'm pretty sure you have to... If you go
from hiding to hiding, you can do it.

2002
02:12:45,028 --> 02:12:48,259
LAURA: You told me, I swear!

2003
02:12:48,259 --> 02:12:49,890
MATT: Read the ability, read the ability!

2004
02:12:49,890 --> 02:12:51,092
LAURA: Okay, where was it?

2005
02:12:51,092 --> 02:12:52,312
LIAM: Right now, on the air.

2006
02:12:52,312 --> 02:12:55,653
LAURA: Okay, where is it? I don't know where it
is. I'll find it, and then I'll find out. And then

2007
02:12:55,653 --> 02:12:57,590
I'll roll for stealth then if it works.

2008
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:02,387
MATT: I'll say for the sake right now of the
distraction, go ahead and do it for now, and we'll

2009
02:13:02,387 --> 02:13:09,311
correct it later if need be. I would rather you
have fun than not. So, what's your stealth roll?

2010
02:13:09,311 --> 02:13:14,220
LAURA: My stealth roll is 15, it doesn't even
matter.

2011
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:19,178
LIAM: 15, she said 15.

2012
02:13:19,178 --> 02:13:24,739
LAURA: It's not in the book, it's in the--

2013
02:13:24,739 --> 02:13:28,313
MATT: No, it's in the PDF. Anyway, what did you
roll?

2014
02:13:28,313 --> 02:13:29,411
LAURA: 15.

2015
02:13:29,411 --> 02:13:34,762
MATT: 15, okay. Good to know. End of your turn.
This elemental creature--

2016
02:13:34,762 --> 02:13:36,698
LIAM: Oh jeez. Here it comes.

2017
02:13:36,698 --> 02:13:38,156
MATT: Comes up over--

2018
02:13:38,156 --> 02:13:39,436
(yelling)

2019
02:13:39,436 --> 02:13:41,590
LIAM: Oh, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!

2020
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:43,723
MARISHA: He tripped at the finish line!

2021
02:13:43,723 --> 02:13:51,829
MATT: As another one tears out of the portal and
begins making its way here at full movement to

2022
02:13:51,829 --> 02:13:57,624
there. This one's going to go ahead and make two
strikes towards you, Scanlan.

2023
02:13:57,624 --> 02:13:59,495
SAM: Two attacks towards me?

2024
02:13:59,495 --> 02:14:03,699
MATT: Yep. That's going to be 11.

2025
02:14:03,699 --> 02:14:06,002
SAM: Is that the attack roll?

2026
02:14:06,002 --> 02:14:12,583
MATT: The attack roll. And a natural one.
Elementals can't roll today. And you're already on

2027
02:14:12,583 --> 02:14:16,532
fire, so its fire form won't make much of a
difference to you either way. All right, so that's

2028
02:14:16,532 --> 02:14:22,022
going to end its turn, and the other elemental
pours in, that's the end of their round. All

2029
02:14:22,022 --> 02:14:23,568
right, that brings us to Gern.

2030
02:14:23,568 --> 02:14:24,933
CHRIS: Oh boy.

2031
02:14:24,933 --> 02:14:26,840
SAM: Feel the Gern, feel the Gern.

2032
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:35,025
MATT: Flames are out, you push-- not Stimpy--
Coral off of you, Coral standing (groan).

2033
02:14:35,025 --> 02:14:42,922
CHRIS: Does it count as my turn if I ask him a
question about the orb?

2034
02:14:42,922 --> 02:14:47,159
MATT: No, you can make a quick little aside. You
have to shout it out, though.

2035
02:14:47,159 --> 02:14:50,985
CHRIS: If I attack the genie, is it just going to
attack the orb, and then he's going to be free?

2036
02:14:50,985 --> 02:14:54,596
SAM: Yes! I'm not looking at you, by the way.

2037
02:14:54,596 --> 02:15:00,000
CHRIS: It really hurts, I didn't realize how much
that hurt!

2038
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,342
SAM: Yeah, I know!

2039
02:15:01,342 --> 02:15:10,944
CHRIS: I've learned a valuable lesson today, while
I've half-caught on fire. Can I cast some type of

2040
02:15:10,944 --> 02:15:14,075
a mental spell through the orb to the fire genie?

2041
02:15:14,075 --> 02:15:16,585
MATT: You can certainly try.

2042
02:15:16,585 --> 02:15:26,197
CHRIS: Would it be too crafty if I were to cast
Modify Memory? Could I modify the fire genie's

2043
02:15:26,197 --> 02:15:38,597
memory to forget to not kill himself? I'll take
that as a no. Can I modify the fire genie's memory

2044
02:15:38,597 --> 02:15:45,602
into thinking that he's completed the task that he
came to this realm to complete, and that he might

2045
02:15:45,602 --> 02:15:46,728
go home?

2046
02:15:46,728 --> 02:15:48,367
MATT: You can certainly try.

2047
02:15:48,367 --> 02:15:50,071
CHRIS: I'd love to try.

2048
02:15:50,071 --> 02:15:52,891
MATT: Okay. What's the range on the spell?

2049
02:15:52,891 --> 02:15:54,081
CHRIS: Infinity.

2050
02:15:54,081 --> 02:15:59,774
(laughter)

2051
02:15:59,774 --> 02:16:06,796
MATT: Modify Memory, where is it? There we go,
5th-level.

2052
02:16:06,796 --> 02:16:08,862
TALIESIN: Oh, God, I hope this works.

2053
02:16:08,862 --> 02:16:15,446
MATT: It's a 30-foot range, so you're going to
have to get a lot closer. You're getting up from

2054
02:16:15,446 --> 02:16:18,758
prone, which is half your movement, so you only
have 15 more feet you can move, so you wouldn't be

2055
02:16:18,758 --> 02:16:20,496
able to even get into range.

2056
02:16:20,496 --> 02:16:31,386
CHRIS: Oh, shit, I can't cast Modify Memory
anyway, I've already cast two spells

2057
02:16:31,386 --> 02:16:33,785
like that today.

2058
02:16:33,785 --> 02:16:38,337
MATT: That's true, Cone of Cold. You're out of
fifth level.

2059
02:16:38,337 --> 02:16:46,730
CHRIS: So which way-- is there a chain of people? I
see a couple right there.

2060
02:16:46,730 --> 02:16:50,677
MARISHA: Here's a laser pointer if you need it.

2061
02:16:50,677 --> 02:16:55,261
CHRIS: Thank you. This guy's new, right?

2062
02:16:55,261 --> 02:16:58,629
MATT: Yeah, and this guy hasn't been touched
really, except for her lightning arrow.

2063
02:16:58,629 --> 02:17:05,407
CHRIS: Oh, I can shoot lightning breath, right?

2064
02:17:05,407 --> 02:17:06,951
MATT: You can, yeah.

2065
02:17:06,951 --> 02:17:12,192
CHRIS: Should I shoot at this guy or this guy?

2066
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:17,894
SAM: Well, the guy next to me might hit me, but
whatever!

2067
02:17:17,894 --> 02:17:28,083
CHRIS: I'll throw some lightning breath at this
person right here.

2068
02:17:28,083 --> 02:17:33,477
MATT: Okay, as you stand up and dust off yourself,
your fantastic zipper-covered dance jacket,

2069
02:17:33,477 --> 02:17:38,394
brushing it off with your hands, you lumber
forward to the outskirts of this newly cracking

2070
02:17:38,394 --> 02:17:43,225
rock crust that once was a lava pool and will soon
be once again, inhale. As you guys look around,

2071
02:17:43,225 --> 02:17:48,352
you see this glow, this blue crackling blow-- glow
on the inside of his mouth. The blow is how he got

2072
02:17:48,352 --> 02:17:50,516
to the mountain and then got inspired to shoot the
lightning.

2073
02:17:50,516 --> 02:17:56,075
CHRIS: I'm flying high, but I can't get an
erection. I've done so much blow.

2074
02:17:56,075 --> 02:18:00,626
MATT: Gern Blanston. Flying high, no erection.

2075
02:18:00,626 --> 02:18:01,911
CHRIS: Sad.

2076
02:18:01,911 --> 02:18:07,390
MATT: This crackling electric energy in the back
of his toothy mouth as he-- (snarl) releases this

2077
02:18:07,390 --> 02:18:12,386
blast of lightning energy forward, striking into
the chest of the fire elemental that freshly

2078
02:18:12,386 --> 02:18:15,808
stepped out of the portal. What's the saving throw
DC on that?

2079
02:18:15,808 --> 02:18:17,016
CHRIS: 14.

2080
02:18:17,016 --> 02:18:20,767
MATT: 14. It rolled a nine, so go ahead and roll
the damage on the breath. How much is it?

2081
02:18:20,767 --> 02:18:22,019
CHRIS: It's 4d6.

2082
02:18:22,019 --> 02:18:23,367
TRAVIS: Love the way you're rolling today.

2083
02:18:23,367 --> 02:18:24,902
MATT: I'm rolling really bad tonight!

2084
02:18:24,902 --> 02:18:29,196
CHRIS: Four, ten, 15, 16!

2085
02:18:29,196 --> 02:18:30,432
SAM: Yeah, that's good.

2086
02:18:30,432 --> 02:18:36,846
MATT: 16 points of lightning damage to that
elemental. (impact) It pulls back from the blast.

2087
02:18:36,846 --> 02:18:43,646
You can see its form has to reconvene. There's a
little bit of black and gray smoke that billows

2088
02:18:43,646 --> 02:18:49,741
out from the wound as it turns to you (snarling).
You've definitely got its attention.

2089
02:18:49,741 --> 02:18:51,394
CHRIS: Hello!

2090
02:18:51,394 --> 02:18:55,257
MATT: With your bonus action, would you like to do
anything with your compadres?

2091
02:18:55,257 --> 02:19:00,252
CHRIS: Oh, right. I still have two left, don't I?

2092
02:19:00,252 --> 02:19:01,595
MATT: Yes, you do.

2093
02:19:01,595 --> 02:19:04,287
SAM: You do like dancing.

2094
02:19:04,287 --> 02:19:13,182
CHRIS: I'd like to send them off to start dancing
just to the left of this gentleman right here.

2095
02:19:13,182 --> 02:19:19,197
Just to distract him a little bit, because I seem
to have caught his attention, so I'd like to start

2096
02:19:19,197 --> 02:19:27,647
a little dance party right there. This fellow
right here, the zombie, can do a little break

2097
02:19:27,647 --> 02:19:36,928
dancing, and then the skeleton can do a bit of the
bird, and then maybe the worm.

2098
02:19:36,928 --> 02:19:43,535
MATT: All right. As the skeleton leaps down into
the worm (crash), just flat laid out, cracking

2099
02:19:43,535 --> 02:19:45,531
part of its pelvis...

2100
02:19:45,531 --> 02:19:47,950
CHRIS: Dancing without music.

2101
02:19:47,950 --> 02:19:50,831
MATT: Yep. No music whatsoever.

2102
02:19:50,831 --> 02:19:59,404
CHRIS: Is the zombie like (zombie groaning). The
tip of his arm falls off at the ulna.

2103
02:19:59,404 --> 02:20:01,483
TALIESIN: Pop and lock! Pop and lock!

2104
02:20:01,483 --> 02:20:06,564
MATT: All right. I'm going to go ahead and--

2105
02:20:06,564 --> 02:20:12,046
CHRIS: These guys are great!

2106
02:20:12,046 --> 02:20:16,122
MATT: I'm going to ask you to go ahead and roll a
performance check.

2107
02:20:16,122 --> 02:20:18,954
SAM: We never do those!

2108
02:20:18,954 --> 02:20:21,962
LAURA: I feel really bad that I killed Carol now.

2109
02:20:21,962 --> 02:20:26,640
MARISHA: Oh, that was almost bad.

2110
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:27,982
TALIESIN: Wait, plus, plus--

2111
02:20:27,982 --> 02:20:29,514
SAM: Oh, you have inspiration!

2112
02:20:29,514 --> 02:20:30,509
MARISHA: You do!

2113
02:20:30,509 --> 02:20:31,403
LAURA: Use it!

2114
02:20:31,403 --> 02:20:32,409
SAM: Use a d10!

2115
02:20:32,409 --> 02:20:33,483
LIAM: This is the time.

2116
02:20:33,483 --> 02:20:37,767
CHRIS: Oh. So seven, plus performance plus one,
eight, and then a d10.

2117
02:20:37,767 --> 02:20:39,658
LIAM: Roll the d10, add it.

2118
02:20:39,658 --> 02:20:42,216
CHRIS: Jesus Christ. Ten.

2119
02:20:42,216 --> 02:20:48,433
MATT: Ten. Trying to recall and hum the song that
Scanlan once sang to you, naught but ten minutes

2120
02:20:48,433 --> 02:20:54,318
before, you don't recall it much at all, and it
comes out (tuneless humming).

2121
02:20:54,318 --> 02:20:58,230
CHRIS: (singing) Gern, Gern, It's Gern. It's Gern
time!

2122
02:20:58,230 --> 02:21:00,212
SAM: Pitchy, little pitchy. Flat.

2123
02:21:00,212 --> 02:21:02,065
CHRIS: (singing) It's Gern, time to Gern!

2124
02:21:02,065 --> 02:21:03,451
SAM: Well, now you're sharp.

2125
02:21:03,451 --> 02:21:07,072
CHRIS: (singing) Gern it all the way. I'm doing
great!

2126
02:21:07,072 --> 02:21:08,786
SAM: Yep, your name was in the song!

2127
02:21:08,786 --> 02:21:13,868
CHRIS: (singing) Gern is my name and this is
definitely the song that I'm singing.

2128
02:21:13,868 --> 02:21:20,233
MATT: It's discordant enough that on a low wisdom
save I'll say the fire elemental's next attack has

2129
02:21:20,233 --> 02:21:30,551
disadvantage. That was the strangest round of
combat I think I've ever had in D&amp;D. All right,

2130
02:21:30,551 --> 02:21:39,300
Percy, you're up. Follow that. First, top of your
round, you take nine points of fire damage.

2131
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:41,189
TALIESIN: That's halved to five.

2132
02:21:41,189 --> 02:21:45,441
LAURA: I have the skirmisher stealth! As a bonus
action at the end of your turn, you can make a

2133
02:21:45,441 --> 02:21:48,288
dexterity (stealth) check to hide again.

2134
02:21:48,288 --> 02:21:50,730
MATT: All right, cool, there you go. Perfect.
Wasn't sure if you had to be hidden

2135
02:21:50,730 --> 02:21:52,338
at the top to do it.

2136
02:21:52,338 --> 02:21:55,765
TALIESIN: I'm going to shift my Hex to the tiny
little (Irish accent) fucker. God, you've got me

2137
02:21:55,765 --> 02:21:58,936
doing it now. Damn it. It's a plague.

2138
02:21:58,936 --> 02:22:00,280
CHRIS: It's contagious.

2139
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,353
MATT: To which one, this guy there?

2140
02:22:01,353 --> 02:22:02,898
TALIESIN: No no no, the one furthest from me.

2141
02:22:02,898 --> 02:22:03,785
MATT: Right there?

2142
02:22:03,785 --> 02:22:08,618
TALIESIN: Yeah, right there. I'll move my Hex to
him. I'm going to bust out the Bad News rifle, I'm

2143
02:22:08,618 --> 02:22:13,077
going to sit, and I'm going to take a nice, calm,
calculated sharpshooter shot at him.

2144
02:22:13,077 --> 02:22:15,212
MATT: All righty.

2145
02:22:15,212 --> 02:22:20,036
TALIESIN: And Bad News just goes (click).

2146
02:22:20,036 --> 02:22:21,317
MATT: Did you misfire?

2147
02:22:21,317 --> 02:22:22,338
TALIESIN: I misfired.

2148
02:22:22,338 --> 02:22:27,541
MATT: Oh no! You get down with the gun and
(click). You look at it and you can see some of

2149
02:22:27,541 --> 02:22:30,543
the metal bowing in the centerpiece like, "That's
bad. That's bad. That's bad. That's bad!"

2150
02:22:30,543 --> 02:22:33,657
TALIESIN: It's fine. I put it down, I pull out the
pistol, and I'm going to take a shot.

2151
02:22:33,657 --> 02:22:38,582
MARISHA: It's hot. It's really hot. Just keep
going.

2152
02:22:38,582 --> 02:22:40,417
TALIESIN: That was really awkward.

2153
02:22:40,417 --> 02:22:44,353
MARISHA: Maybe the heat made you misfire.

2154
02:22:44,353 --> 02:22:46,061
TRAVIS: Just roll the dice.

2155
02:22:46,061 --> 02:22:47,857
LIAM: You're also 60 feet apart at the moment.

2156
02:22:47,857 --> 02:22:51,564
TALIESIN: That's a 25 to hit.

2157
02:22:51,564 --> 02:22:54,910
MATT: 25 hits. Sharpshooter? No.

2158
02:22:54,910 --> 02:22:55,835
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2159
02:22:55,835 --> 02:22:57,658
MATT: That's sharpshooter? Wow. Nice roll.

2160
02:22:57,658 --> 02:23:09,668
TALIESIN: Six, 12, 22 points of damage. And I
reload, and that's my turn.

2161
02:23:09,668 --> 02:23:14,356
MATT: That's your turn. Okay. Finishing up Percy,
that brings us to Scanlan. You're still

2162
02:23:14,356 --> 02:23:16,199
concentrating on Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

2163
02:23:16,199 --> 02:23:17,322
SAM: Oh, yes I am.

2164
02:23:17,322 --> 02:23:18,779
LIAM: The gnome has got this.

2165
02:23:18,779 --> 02:23:21,439
SAM: Hey, how's that stuff under my feet?

2166
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:23,910
MATT: Pretty rough. You're going to want to step
off of it very soon, probably.

2167
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:25,835
SAM: I'm going to step into it.

2168
02:23:25,835 --> 02:23:28,664
LIAM: Love you, Scanlan.

2169
02:23:28,664 --> 02:23:31,870
SAM: So I can fire a Lightning Bolt and hit both
of those guys.

2170
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:33,641
MATT: Oh, snap. Okay.

2171
02:23:33,641 --> 02:23:36,776
SAM: And yeah, that's it. That'll be my--

2172
02:23:36,776 --> 02:23:38,449
MATT: You can still move after that.

2173
02:23:38,449 --> 02:23:41,222
SAM: Oh, good! Okay, good, thank you for saving
me.

2174
02:23:41,222 --> 02:23:43,058
MATT: So the bolt arcs past, go ahead.

2175
02:23:43,058 --> 02:23:44,571
CHRIS: I saw that, it was great!

2176
02:23:44,571 --> 02:23:48,173
SAM: Oh, for once! Thank you! Thank you, it was
for you!

2177
02:23:48,173 --> 02:23:49,769
CHRIS: Much appreciated!

2178
02:23:49,769 --> 02:23:53,353
MATT: Five, no. And a 12 plus three, 15, no. Both
fail their saving throw.

2179
02:23:53,353 --> 02:23:54,823
SAM: Okay, so 8d6?

2180
02:23:54,823 --> 02:24:00,657
MATT: 8d6 points of lightning damage to both of
them. It's a wonderful display, Gern.

2181
02:24:00,657 --> 02:24:03,693
LIAM: I ship Scanlan and Gern.

2182
02:24:03,693 --> 02:24:05,694
CHRIS: Shh, guys, please.

2183
02:24:05,694 --> 02:24:08,129
SAM: 33.

2184
02:24:08,129 --> 02:24:09,736
MATT: 33, nice roll.

2185
02:24:09,736 --> 02:24:16,777
CHRIS: Oh, that Lightning Bolt was so big. And
wide!

2186
02:24:16,777 --> 02:24:19,637
SAM: It's the width that really does it.

2187
02:24:19,637 --> 02:24:23,077
CHRIS: It really does. It's not so much the
length.

2188
02:24:23,077 --> 02:24:25,007
TALIESIN: It's the girth of Gern.

2189
02:24:25,007 --> 02:24:31,640
SAM: And I will re-inspire Gern. Oh, wait, you're
still injured, aren't you?

2190
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:32,550
CHRIS: Yeah.

2191
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:33,751
SAM: I will heal Gern.

2192
02:24:33,751 --> 02:24:34,467
CHRIS: Please.

2193
02:24:34,467 --> 02:24:39,288
SAM: With another Healing Word. This time at
third level.

2194
02:24:39,288 --> 02:24:43,897
MATT: Technically, a second spell can only be as
high as second level. You used two spells in one

2195
02:24:43,897 --> 02:24:44,690
round.

2196
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:46,113
LIAM: It's still very romantic, though.

2197
02:24:46,113 --> 02:24:50,981
SAM: Okay, I'll do a 2nd-level Healing Word, and I
will sing to him, because I'm running out of

2198
02:24:50,981 --> 02:24:58,372
things that rhyme with his name: (singing) Gern
down for what! (EDM beat) Gern down for what!

2199
02:24:58,372 --> 02:25:01,014
That's it.

2200
02:25:01,014 --> 02:25:04,032
CHRIS: Might I remind you I am unable to get an
erection at the moment?

2201
02:25:04,032 --> 02:25:09,861
MATT: However, in spite of that, the blue pill
does give you ten additional hit points healed.

2202
02:25:09,861 --> 02:25:13,512
LAURA: Did the skeleton and the zombie start
dancing better, after that?

2203
02:25:13,512 --> 02:25:17,034
MATT: Yeah, it actually does pick up their pace a
little bit now that they have a backtrack.

2204
02:25:17,034 --> 02:25:21,197
CHRIS: What is the elemental doing while they're
dancing?

2205
02:25:21,197 --> 02:25:26,062
MATT: Well, it's currently being surrounded by a
swirl of Hex shadow and looking around very

2206
02:25:26,062 --> 02:25:28,563
confused and wondering why it got up in the
morning.

2207
02:25:28,563 --> 02:25:30,618
TALIESIN: Where did the glow sticks come from?

2208
02:25:30,618 --> 02:25:32,113
MATT: Do you want to move out?

2209
02:25:32,113 --> 02:25:33,174
SAM: And I can move out?

2210
02:25:33,174 --> 02:25:34,063
MATT: Yeah, you can.

2211
02:25:34,063 --> 02:25:35,108
SAM: Will he take a swipe at me?

2212
02:25:35,108 --> 02:25:37,919
MATT: It will yes, but better than possibly
falling in.

2213
02:25:37,919 --> 02:25:39,942
SAM: I'm still on fire, right?

2214
02:25:39,942 --> 02:25:44,434
MATT: Yes, you are. Takes an action to put it out,
though, unfortunately. That's 18 plus six. I

2215
02:25:44,434 --> 02:25:51,891
believe that does hit you. You take 12 points of
fire damage.

2216
02:25:51,891 --> 02:25:54,362
SAM: Plus whatever I was on fire for.

2217
02:25:54,362 --> 02:25:56,032
MATT: You already took that damage earlier.

2218
02:25:56,032 --> 02:25:58,820
SAM: Oh, I did? At the beginning of my turn.

2219
02:25:58,820 --> 02:26:01,516
MATT: Yeah, I rolled for that already, you take
nine points of fire damage, I think it was.

2220
02:26:01,516 --> 02:26:02,792
SAM: Oh, okay, plus 12?

2221
02:26:02,792 --> 02:26:10,122
MATT: Plus 12. If I'm wrong, whatever, it's fine.
All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Keyleth.

2222
02:26:10,122 --> 02:26:15,394
MARISHA: So we have these two assholes in front of
us.

2223
02:26:15,394 --> 02:26:18,573
LIAM: My name is Vax.

2224
02:26:18,573 --> 02:26:25,544
MARISHA: Well, depends on the day. So, that guy is
still alive too, yeah?

2225
02:26:25,544 --> 02:26:29,905
MATT: Yeah, all three of these guys are alive. And
this guy's in a hamster ball.

2226
02:26:29,905 --> 02:26:32,352
LAURA: Being pissed!

2227
02:26:32,352 --> 02:26:34,987
TALIESIN: It's just like a weather balloon.

2228
02:26:34,987 --> 02:26:37,089
MATT: Yeah it's a rover just holding him in
place.

2229
02:26:37,089 --> 02:26:46,287
MARISHA: I'm going to Tidal Wave again. Tidal
Wave! Right here, this way, fucking

2230
02:26:46,287 --> 02:26:47,635
with these two guys.

2231
02:26:47,635 --> 02:26:49,541
MATT: All righty, let's go ahead and roll some
saving throws on their end.

2232
02:26:49,541 --> 02:26:51,399
('The Prisoner' theme starts playing)

2233
02:26:51,399 --> 02:26:53,686
TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you.

2234
02:26:53,686 --> 02:26:59,699
MATT: Yeah. Six and an eight, both fail. Who is
number one?

2235
02:26:59,699 --> 02:27:03,579
CHRIS: I am not a number, I'm a free man!

2236
02:27:03,579 --> 02:27:09,654
MATT: So good, so good. The original one, not the
remake. Patrick McGoohan. Two failed saving

2237
02:27:09,654 --> 02:27:11,698
throws, go ahead and roll damage on that.

2238
02:27:11,698 --> 02:27:17,110
MARISHA: It's really good, I'm warning you right
now. Seven and seven is 14 plus another six,

2239
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:25,617
brings me to 20, plus eight, 28, again. That's
what I had last time right? 28.

2240
02:27:25,617 --> 02:27:26,708
LIAM: Kismet.

2241
02:27:26,708 --> 02:27:30,783
MATT: 28 points of water damage, plus the
additional blast of water gallons surging through

2242
02:27:30,783 --> 02:27:35,617
them, manages to completely scatter both these
guys.

2243
02:27:35,617 --> 02:27:40,867
TALIESIN: We actually had a Critter tweet us how
much water.

2244
02:27:40,867 --> 02:27:42,514
MATT: How much water would be in a Tidal Wave?

2245
02:27:42,514 --> 02:27:44,040
TALIESIN: 225 gallons.

2246
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:45,802
MATT: Oh, there is no way they're surviving that.

2247
02:27:45,802 --> 02:27:50,457
MARISHA: And then technically in Tidal Wave it
says the water then spreads out across the ground

2248
02:27:50,457 --> 02:27:54,881
in all directions, extinguishing unprotected
flames in the area within 30 feet of it.

2249
02:27:54,881 --> 02:28:00,706
MATT: Unprotected flames are different than lava
pools. Water doesn't cool it, it just evaporates.

2250
02:28:00,706 --> 02:28:02,347
TALIESIN: We've got steam.

2251
02:28:02,347 --> 02:28:06,016
MATT: You do. You have a very heavy cloud of steam
now, that is (steam sound) to the side. The

2252
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:12,295
dancing skeleton and zombie are now just these
shadows lit in this cool music video light now as

2253
02:28:12,295 --> 02:28:13,773
they're (groan) dancing.

2254
02:28:13,773 --> 02:28:16,941
LIAM: As if this were a Telltale game, at the top
of the screen it says,

2255
02:28:16,941 --> 02:28:18,809
'Keyleth will remember this'.

2256
02:28:18,809 --> 02:28:26,889
MATT: Exactly. Tidal Wave on fire elementals is
nasty, man.

2257
02:28:26,889 --> 02:28:31,579
("Thriller" starts playing)

2258
02:28:31,579 --> 02:28:33,774
MARISHA: Can I use my bonus action--

2259
02:28:33,774 --> 02:28:46,561
MATT: Perfect. This is happening, guys. Is that
the rest of your turn, Keyleth? Do you want to

2260
02:28:46,561 --> 02:28:47,813
move somewhere?

2261
02:28:47,813 --> 02:28:48,779
MARISHA: Question.

2262
02:28:48,779 --> 02:28:50,722
MATT: Yes, what's your question?

2263
02:28:50,722 --> 02:28:55,229
MARISHA: Can I theoretically cast a Grasping Vine
coming out of the hellmouth?

2264
02:28:55,229 --> 02:28:59,256
MATT: No, Grasping Vine is a 4th-level spell, I
believe, and as a bonus action you can't do

2265
02:28:59,256 --> 02:29:01,179
anything more than a 2nd-level spell in the same
round.

2266
02:29:01,179 --> 02:29:07,183
MARISHA: Fuck, never mind. Actually, no, that's
not true. I will take my bonus Healing Word to

2267
02:29:07,183 --> 02:29:12,291
toss another Healing Word, just 1st-level, over to
Gern.

2268
02:29:12,291 --> 02:29:14,633
MATT: Everyone's keeping the dance master alive
over there.

2269
02:29:14,633 --> 02:29:16,123
CHRIS: Oh my god, amazing.

2270
02:29:16,123 --> 02:29:22,933
MARISHA: So you heal eight points, Gern.

2271
02:29:22,933 --> 02:29:25,578
MATT: Eight points of healing to you, Gern.

2272
02:29:25,578 --> 02:29:26,883
SAM: He's gone.

2273
02:29:26,883 --> 02:29:28,592
MATT: We can't save him. Grog, you're up.

2274
02:29:28,592 --> 02:29:35,130
TRAVIS: I use another reckless attack and I make
the first strike against the guy right in front of me.

2275
02:29:35,130 --> 02:29:36,514
MATT: Go for it.

2276
02:29:36,514 --> 02:29:40,851
TRAVIS: Jesus. Better. 14.

2277
02:29:40,851 --> 02:29:43,954
MATT: 14 misses, unfortunately.

2278
02:29:43,954 --> 02:29:44,979
TRAVIS: Damn it.

2279
02:29:44,979 --> 02:29:47,342
MATT: Are these with great weapon master?

2280
02:29:47,342 --> 02:29:56,438
TRAVIS: No, just reckless attack. This one is with
great weapon master. Nope. Better. 16 plus nine is

2281
02:29:56,438 --> 02:29:57,907
25, minus five is 20.

2282
02:29:57,907 --> 02:29:59,000
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2283
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:05,842
TRAVIS: Yahtzee! Five, ten, 18, 28!

2284
02:30:05,842 --> 02:30:12,426
MATT: 28 points of damage, okay. This time, as you
release the first blow of your sword forward, he

2285
02:30:12,426 --> 02:30:16,138
catches it in the blade of the trident and
deflects it off to the side, slamming it into the

2286
02:30:16,138 --> 02:30:20,171
ground, almost pinning the weapon for a second. He
gets up in your face and grins (snarls), and the

2287
02:30:20,171 --> 02:30:24,235
actual breath that emanates from its teeth begins
to burn and singe the edge of your beard hairs.

2288
02:30:24,235 --> 02:30:31,728
That infuriates you, and you lift up Craven Edge
between the blades of the trident. It's a test of

2289
02:30:31,728 --> 02:30:36,021
strength as you both tense, and eventually you
lift it back, and with the backswing, slash him

2290
02:30:36,021 --> 02:30:41,851
right across his chest with that blow. You see a
strike of extremely hot, hot blood splatter

2291
02:30:41,851 --> 02:30:45,441
across, (sizzling), singe the front of your chest
and leave little burn marks on you.

2292
02:30:45,441 --> 02:30:46,505
SAM: Yes!

2293
02:30:46,505 --> 02:30:47,694
TRAVIS: Like freckles.

2294
02:30:47,694 --> 02:30:49,346
LIAM: You don't want to fuck with his beard!

2295
02:30:49,346 --> 02:30:53,003
MATT: He does make the save.

2296
02:30:53,003 --> 02:30:54,274
CHRIS: She has a name.

2297
02:30:54,274 --> 02:30:58,077
LIAM: Sorry, Laura.

2298
02:30:58,077 --> 02:31:00,507
MATT: Well played. Does that end your turn?

2299
02:31:00,507 --> 02:31:02,214
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the end of my turn.

2300
02:31:02,214 --> 02:31:03,739
LAURA: Why am I laughing at that?

2301
02:31:03,739 --> 02:31:06,874
TRAVIS: Darling, shush.

2302
02:31:06,874 --> 02:31:11,959
MATT: Efreet's going to start pushing against the
ball, which is going to begin to coast through the

2303
02:31:11,959 --> 02:31:13,416
air this way.

2304
02:31:13,416 --> 02:31:17,066
LIAM: Does he spin the globe?

2305
02:31:17,066 --> 02:31:23,778
MATT: Just gliding through slowly.

2306
02:31:23,778 --> 02:31:24,942
TRAVIS: Genie hamster.

2307
02:31:24,942 --> 02:31:26,573
MATT: Yeah, that's about all he can do this turn.

2308
02:31:26,573 --> 02:31:28,226
SAM: Sorry!

2309
02:31:28,226 --> 02:31:31,947
MATT: No, no, it's what you do. It's what you do.
All right, Vax, you're up.

2310
02:31:31,947 --> 02:31:37,492
LIAM: Man, all right. I'm in a good spot, I'll
just throw three more daggers at the salamander

2311
02:31:37,492 --> 02:31:44,036
that Grog has not yet killed. First one is a
natural 20, the second one is a 13, and the third

2312
02:31:44,036 --> 02:31:46,644
one is, aw, fuck, is a 14.

2313
02:31:46,644 --> 02:31:53,785
MATT: Okay. Hold off on those two attacks, just in
case how much your critical sneak attack does.

2314
02:31:53,785 --> 02:32:08,757
LIAM: Five, six, seven, eight, 12, 18, 21, 25. 25,
so you double the dice, is 56 for the first one.

2315
02:32:08,757 --> 02:32:14,590
MATT: Okay, so as you throw the dagger, it goes
right past Grog's ear and you hear the (whoosh) of

2316
02:32:14,590 --> 02:32:19,988
the wind as it just brushes past your face. After
you finish your backswing with Craven Edge, as the

2317
02:32:19,988 --> 02:32:26,387
salamander creature rears back from the impact, it
looks towards you, and its eyes twitch ever so

2318
02:32:26,387 --> 02:32:30,329
slightly to your right as it sees the incoming
blade a little too late as it (impact) right into

2319
02:32:30,329 --> 02:32:35,673
its right eye socket. Its tongue lolls out of its
jaw as it falls onto its back, and its tail moves

2320
02:32:35,673 --> 02:32:38,856
and twitches for a few seconds before it
eventually goes limp.

2321
02:32:38,856 --> 02:32:41,745
TRAVIS: No, no, he's still alive! And I kick him.
Now he's dead.

2322
02:32:41,745 --> 02:32:48,685
MATT: Grog stomps it into the ground. The
twitching stops, the salamander now destroyed.

2323
02:32:48,685 --> 02:32:51,936
TRAVIS: Does the dagger stay in his eye socket?

2324
02:32:51,936 --> 02:32:54,325
MATT: It's currently in the eye socket, yeah.

2325
02:32:54,325 --> 02:32:57,633
TRAVIS: Ooh. Can I reach down and grab it?

2326
02:32:57,633 --> 02:33:01,315
MATT: Yeah. You reach down and grab the dagger,
and as you pull it out, (poof) it turns into smoke

2327
02:33:01,315 --> 02:33:02,369
in your hand.

2328
02:33:02,369 --> 02:33:04,965
TRAVIS: Holy shit! I look back at Vax.

2329
02:33:04,965 --> 02:33:07,047
LIAM: Grog, how did you do that?

2330
02:33:07,047 --> 02:33:13,418
TRAVIS: I don't know! I think maybe I'm a magic
user now! And I start trying to cast reanimate

2331
02:33:13,418 --> 02:33:15,659
person on the dead thing.

2332
02:33:15,659 --> 02:33:16,691
MATT: Okay.

2333
02:33:16,691 --> 02:33:18,119
CHRIS: That's not how you do that!

2334
02:33:18,119 --> 02:33:19,747
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I've got to concentrate!

2335
02:33:19,747 --> 02:33:20,843
CHRIS: All right.

2336
02:33:20,843 --> 02:33:23,123
TRAVIS: (straining)

2337
02:33:23,123 --> 02:33:24,127
LAURA: Hey, Scanlan!

2338
02:33:24,127 --> 02:33:25,068
SAM: Oi!

2339
02:33:25,068 --> 02:33:26,673
LAURA: What are we going to do with this giant
ball?

2340
02:33:26,673 --> 02:33:31,687
SAM: We need someone to bring him down to earth.
Keyleth, can you vine him down? Or, Gern, do you

2341
02:33:31,687 --> 02:33:33,790
have something that can move things?

2342
02:33:33,790 --> 02:33:34,814
MARISHA: Can I--

2343
02:33:34,814 --> 02:33:36,491
CHRIS: Go ahead.

2344
02:33:36,491 --> 02:33:38,502
MARISHA: No, go, you first. Please, Gern.

2345
02:33:38,502 --> 02:33:40,669
LIAM: Does anyone have a large purple hand they
could use?

2346
02:33:40,669 --> 02:33:43,218
TALIESIN: I think he would lose--

2347
02:33:43,218 --> 02:33:45,160
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a concentration spell.

2348
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:46,673
MATT: Yeah, one spell at a time.

2349
02:33:46,673 --> 02:33:49,262
CHRIS: I thought I had some sort of a Telekinesis
spell, but I guess I don't.

2350
02:33:49,262 --> 02:33:51,017
SAM: Chromatic Orb?

2351
02:33:51,017 --> 02:33:52,829
MARISHA: No, that's an attack.

2352
02:33:52,829 --> 02:33:55,387
LAURA: Can you bring it down, Keyleth?

2353
02:33:55,387 --> 02:34:00,887
MARISHA: I can try. Can I do a Grasping Vine from
the bottom underneath of him, and see if I can?

2354
02:34:00,887 --> 02:34:02,174
LIAM: He's over lava.

2355
02:34:02,174 --> 02:34:03,359
SAM: He's got something!

2356
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:04,513
CHRIS: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

2357
02:34:04,513 --> 02:34:07,542
MATT: What are you doing? I know what you're
doing, what are you doing?

2358
02:34:07,542 --> 02:34:15,116
CHRIS: I could either manipulate his memory, or I
do have a flying broom.

2359
02:34:15,116 --> 02:34:17,363
SAM: What?

2360
02:34:17,363 --> 02:34:18,496
LIAM: Yes?

2361
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:19,856
CHRIS: Yes, I have a flying broom.

2362
02:34:19,856 --> 02:34:20,965
TRAVIS: Like you do.

2363
02:34:20,965 --> 02:34:22,990
LAURA: Are you going to bat him down like you're
sweeping the sky?

2364
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:25,943
CHRIS: I could fly up and gently glide him down.

2365
02:34:25,943 --> 02:34:28,978
LAURA: How come everybody flies?

2366
02:34:28,978 --> 02:34:31,846
MATT: Are you doing your vine as well?

2367
02:34:31,846 --> 02:34:33,759
MARISHA: Let me see how this goes first.

2368
02:34:33,759 --> 02:34:41,252
MATT: So, without any other command, your two
friends, Coral and Stimpy, are still over there

2369
02:34:41,252 --> 02:34:49,038
dancing as the mist slowly dissipates from the
deluge. You pull out from the side of your little

2370
02:34:49,038 --> 02:34:55,430
satchel there your flying broom, which is a pretty
decent, medium-sized broom, places it in the air

2371
02:34:55,430 --> 02:35:00,308
and it rests there, slightly shifting in place.
You leap up onto it and grab onto the front as you

2372
02:35:00,308 --> 02:35:01,974
shoot up from the side.

2373
02:35:01,974 --> 02:35:05,233
CHRIS: Going up to catch the golden bitch!

2374
02:35:05,233 --> 02:35:09,361
LAURA: There's flying brooms?!

2375
02:35:09,361 --> 02:35:15,706
MATT: As you place yourself on top of Otiluke's
Resilient Sphere, placing all your weight onto it,

2376
02:35:15,706 --> 02:35:22,710
it sinks a little bit, then it comes to a halt.
About three feet it sinks, as you're just standing

2377
02:35:22,710 --> 02:35:23,800
on top of it.

2378
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:25,281
MARISHA: That's as far as it goes?

2379
02:35:25,281 --> 02:35:27,805
MATT: What do you want to do?

2380
02:35:27,805 --> 02:35:31,758
CHRIS: I'd like to try to cast a memory spell on
it, if possible.

2381
02:35:31,758 --> 02:35:36,971
MATT: Okay. Well, you've already cast a 5th-level
spell twice, how many 5th-level spells can you

2382
02:35:36,971 --> 02:35:38,091
cast per day?

2383
02:35:38,091 --> 02:35:39,167
CHRIS: Two.

2384
02:35:39,167 --> 02:35:41,763
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately you're out of 5th-level
slots.

2385
02:35:41,763 --> 02:35:45,628
CHRIS: Could I cast it on you to forget that I've
already cast it twice?

2386
02:35:45,628 --> 02:35:49,489
LIAM: Scanlan, how much time do we have with this
bubble?

2387
02:35:49,489 --> 02:35:52,403
SAM: A minute, but about 30 seconds have gone by.

2388
02:35:52,403 --> 02:35:55,060
MATT: Yeah, you're getting down to about the
40-second mark.

2389
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:57,118
TALIESIN: Can I put myself out while all of this
is happening?

2390
02:35:57,118 --> 02:35:58,311
MATT: Yes, you can do that.

2391
02:35:58,311 --> 02:35:59,506
SAM: Can he push down?

2392
02:35:59,506 --> 02:36:01,865
MATT: You can jump onto it and begin to push
down.

2393
02:36:01,865 --> 02:36:04,651
CHRIS: I'm going to push down with all my might,
to try to get him down on the ground.

2394
02:36:04,651 --> 02:36:09,780
MATT: You leap in the air and jump on it again and
as you do the orb (sinking noise) and just slowly,

2395
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:16,253
over the next 15 seconds shove it down to the
point where you're over the orb on the very top,

2396
02:36:16,253 --> 02:36:19,151
as you can feel the spell about to dissipate.

2397
02:36:19,151 --> 02:36:24,485
LIAM: Grog, Grog! Stop trying to reanimate that
thing and hit the freaking red guy into the hole!

2398
02:36:24,485 --> 02:36:26,445
MATT: Grog, go ahead and roll an arcana check.

2399
02:36:26,445 --> 02:36:28,777
SAM: Oh, he's the best at arcana.

2400
02:36:28,777 --> 02:36:31,696
LIAM: 20. Get it. Get it. Reanimate that fucker.

2401
02:36:31,696 --> 02:36:32,832
TRAVIS: Six.

2402
02:36:32,832 --> 02:36:36,171
MATT: Six. This isn't working.

2403
02:36:36,171 --> 02:36:39,240
TRAVIS: Must be a rookie mistake.

2404
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:42,979
SAM: What are we trying to do, shove him back into
the hole?

2405
02:36:42,979 --> 02:36:44,688
TALIESIN: Shove him in the hole!

2406
02:36:44,688 --> 02:36:46,419
LIAM: Grog, shove that fucking thing in there.

2407
02:36:46,419 --> 02:36:47,762
TRAVIS: He's over lava.

2408
02:36:47,762 --> 02:36:50,671
LIAM: You are made of hit points!

2409
02:36:50,671 --> 02:36:55,492
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it-- This is your thing.

2410
02:36:55,492 --> 02:36:59,273
MARISHA: Can I do the vines from out of the
portal?

2411
02:36:59,273 --> 02:37:03,247
MATT: No, it has to have an anchor point
somewhere.

2412
02:37:03,247 --> 02:37:07,570
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it, now I just run, in a
rage, I run into the lava and I start shoving him

2413
02:37:07,570 --> 02:37:11,791
straight toward the flaming vagina hole.

2414
02:37:11,791 --> 02:37:16,290
MATT: Okay, I want you to make an athletics check.
Actually, no, this would be a full strength check.

2415
02:37:16,290 --> 02:37:19,778
Just roll a strength check. You have advantage
because you're still raging. Although you

2416
02:37:19,778 --> 02:37:23,707
wouldn't be raging anymore because you spent time
concentrating on the spell, you could go into a

2417
02:37:23,707 --> 02:37:26,752
rage for this if you'd like to, spend another use
of your rage.

2418
02:37:26,752 --> 02:37:28,328
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll use another one.

2419
02:37:28,328 --> 02:37:39,962
MATT: Okay, you go into a rage. All right, as you
step into the lava, you suffer 26 points of fire

2420
02:37:39,962 --> 02:37:44,243
damage from wading up to your knees in molten
rock.

2421
02:37:44,243 --> 02:37:45,427
MARISHA: Halved.

2422
02:37:45,427 --> 02:37:46,891
MATT: Halved because of your resistance.

2423
02:37:46,891 --> 02:37:49,851
TRAVIS: So 12. I rolled a 22.

2424
02:37:49,851 --> 02:37:56,295
MATT: 22. With that you, (boof), you shove the
sphere, which shifts back about halfway to there.

2425
02:37:56,295 --> 02:38:02,155
You have to catch yourself on the side, grabbing
the broom and holding it out here as you're

2426
02:38:02,155 --> 02:38:05,775
stepping the other direction. I want you to make
an acrobatics check.

2427
02:38:05,775 --> 02:38:14,560
CHRIS: All right. Seven.

2428
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:16,395
MATT: Seven.

2429
02:38:16,395 --> 02:38:19,039
TALIESIN: You have inspiration!

2430
02:38:19,039 --> 02:38:20,417
SAM: Nope. He used it.

2431
02:38:20,417 --> 02:38:26,359
MATT: As you (slipping noise) slip off the top of
the sphere, begin to fall back toward the lava

2432
02:38:26,359 --> 02:38:33,674
behind you, in a very Lord of the Rings Gollum
tumbling into Mount Doom type of view. (sploosh)

2433
02:38:33,674 --> 02:38:36,485
Back first into the lava.

2434
02:38:36,485 --> 02:38:37,843
LAURA: Oh shit.

2435
02:38:37,843 --> 02:38:39,200
CHRIS: I feel fine.

2436
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:47,539
MATT: Actually, you take six points of fire
damage. Impacting-- rolled really low on that. (sploosh)

2437
02:38:47,539 --> 02:38:55,796
You can feel the back of your scales and the flesh
on your back immediately begin to burn with

2438
02:38:55,796 --> 02:39:00,597
horrifying pain. You're holding your broom aloft,
'cause you don't want that to go in the fire.

2439
02:39:00,597 --> 02:39:02,519
LAURA: I run forward to try to help him out.

2440
02:39:02,519 --> 02:39:04,281
SAM: And steal the broom.

2441
02:39:04,281 --> 02:39:08,158
MATT: And with that, the sphere breaks.

2442
02:39:08,158 --> 02:39:10,150
(disgruntled moans)

2443
02:39:10,150 --> 02:39:11,841
LIAM: Crap.

2444
02:39:11,841 --> 02:39:14,849
MARISHA: Can Keyleth run up, do I have an action?

2445
02:39:14,849 --> 02:39:19,171
MATT: Right now we're going back to the initiative
order, since combat has re-initiated with the

2446
02:39:19,171 --> 02:39:24,344
sphere opened. That brings us to the top. The
efreet, now freed from its sphere,

2447
02:39:24,344 --> 02:39:25,665
is going to go first.

2448
02:39:25,665 --> 02:39:26,607
LIAM: He's mad.

2449
02:39:26,607 --> 02:39:30,480
MATT: He is livid. All right.

2450
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:34,323
TRAVIS: I just want you to know, I was trying to
free you.

2451
02:39:34,323 --> 02:39:37,244
SAM: I don't know these people.

2452
02:39:37,244 --> 02:39:40,056
LIAM: These assholes.

2453
02:39:40,056 --> 02:39:43,658
TRAVIS: Can you believe how rude these people are?

2454
02:39:43,658 --> 02:39:45,407
MATT: He's going to fly back up.

2455
02:39:45,407 --> 02:39:47,166
(groans)

2456
02:39:47,166 --> 02:39:58,661
MATT: Keep away. Let's see. It's going to cast
Invisibility on itself, then it vanishes from view.

2457
02:39:58,661 --> 02:40:00,695
MARISHA: Great.

2458
02:40:00,695 --> 02:40:04,605
SAM: As it does that, do I recognize the spell?

2459
02:40:04,605 --> 02:40:05,824
MATT: You do.

2460
02:40:05,824 --> 02:40:08,672
SAM: I cast Counterspell.

2461
02:40:08,672 --> 02:40:16,597
MATT: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll-- Oh, wait,
no, it's a 2nd-level spell. It auto-- Yeah. Yeah.

2462
02:40:16,597 --> 02:40:17,861
Because it is a 2nd-level spell.

2463
02:40:17,861 --> 02:40:18,953
SAM: Hi!

2464
02:40:18,953 --> 02:40:21,298
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2465
02:40:21,298 --> 02:40:26,665
MATT: As its form begins to vanish, Scanlan, what
do you do to counter it?

2466
02:40:26,761 --> 02:40:33,781
SAM: I'm going to sing-- No! I'm going to distract
it with this.

2467
02:40:33,781 --> 02:40:35,337
TALIESIN: With an app?

2468
02:40:35,337 --> 02:40:41,357
SAM: With an app. (airhorn) (song starts) Oh, wait
that's not what I wanted to do!

2469
02:40:41,357 --> 02:40:45,979
CHRIS: Keep going! Distract him with your morning
radio program!

2470
02:40:45,979 --> 02:40:53,014
MATT: And that bit of chaos is just enough, as he
begins to cast his innate Invisibility spell, it

2471
02:40:53,014 --> 02:40:59,433
looks over. "What in the-- Shit!" And loses the
spell concentration. The invisibility field

2472
02:40:59,433 --> 02:41:05,915
vanishes, and it stands there above. All right,
that brings us to Vax.

2473
02:41:05,915 --> 02:41:11,692
LIAM: Oh, shite. All right, I'm going to leap over
the lava pit.

2474
02:41:11,692 --> 02:41:13,465
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

2475
02:41:13,465 --> 02:41:21,058
LIAM: Yeah. That'll be a 28. I run up behind Grog,
and I should be within--

2476
02:41:21,058 --> 02:41:24,179
MATT: Darting around the side there, because you
are hasted with this, so you can actually just

2477
02:41:24,179 --> 02:41:25,543
dart around the side.

2478
02:41:25,543 --> 02:41:28,999
LIAM: All right, right behind Grog. I should be
within 60 feet of the efreeti.

2479
02:41:28,999 --> 02:41:29,953
MATT: Yes.

2480
02:41:29,953 --> 02:41:31,348
LIAM: And I'll throw three daggers at it.

2481
02:41:31,348 --> 02:41:32,296
MATT: Go for it.

2482
02:41:32,296 --> 02:41:33,662
LIAM: First one is a 34.

2483
02:41:33,662 --> 02:41:34,611
MATT: That hits.

2484
02:41:34,611 --> 02:41:40,027
LIAM: Second one is a 27. Third is a 29, so they
all hit.

2485
02:41:40,027 --> 02:41:41,741
MATT: Shit, jeez, 34.

2486
02:41:41,741 --> 02:41:43,169
LIAM: But there's no sneak attack on these--

2487
02:41:43,169 --> 02:41:45,595
MATT: How did you get 34 on your attack?

2488
02:41:45,595 --> 02:41:55,898
LIAM: I don't know anymore. I rolled really high,
and I rolled my attack bonus, like a 19 plus 11?

2489
02:41:55,898 --> 02:41:57,367
A 30?

2490
02:41:57,367 --> 02:41:58,651
MATT: 30, okay.

2491
02:41:58,651 --> 02:41:59,752
LIAM: I don't know.

2492
02:41:59,752 --> 02:42:00,908
MATT: That's okay. A 30 works.

2493
02:42:00,908 --> 02:42:02,421
LIAM: Math looked right when I did it.

2494
02:42:02,421 --> 02:42:08,065
MATT: 34, I was just like (groaning) bleeding from
the nose, I couldn't deal with it. 30 hits.

2495
02:42:08,065 --> 02:42:12,377
LIAM: There's no subterfuge, it might be
stupidity. First one's a ten, second one was a

2496
02:42:12,377 --> 02:42:15,403
ten, and the third one is a seven.

2497
02:42:15,403 --> 02:42:18,472
MATT: Seven. Got it. Cool. That ends your turn,
Vax. That brings us to Vex.

2498
02:42:18,472 --> 02:42:19,824
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

2499
02:42:19,824 --> 02:42:21,584
MATT: All right. It is...

2500
02:42:21,584 --> 02:42:25,269
LAURA: It wasn't, because I used Lightning Arrow,
so it dropped the concentration on it.

2501
02:42:25,269 --> 02:42:28,530
MATT: That's right, so you Hunter's Mark once
again. Put that back on there. All right.

2502
02:42:28,530 --> 02:42:32,350
LAURA: Although it doesn't really matter because
I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on him and I

2503
02:42:32,350 --> 02:42:35,149
lose my Hunter's Mark again.

2504
02:42:35,149 --> 02:42:40,179
TRAVIS: Trauma from the earlier episodes. Hunter's
Mark!

2505
02:42:40,179 --> 02:42:43,169
MATT: All right, so Lightning Arrow again, go
ahead and roll for the attack.

2506
02:42:43,169 --> 02:42:48,755
LAURA: Oh yeah! Oh, that's 31?

2507
02:42:48,755 --> 02:42:49,906
LIAM: 79!

2508
02:42:49,906 --> 02:42:51,673
LAURA: 31!

2509
02:42:51,673 --> 02:42:52,945
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2510
02:42:52,945 --> 02:42:54,236
LAURA: Okay!

2511
02:42:54,236 --> 02:42:57,882
MATT: Gern, you're on deck.

2512
02:42:57,882 --> 02:43:05,356
LAURA: 23!

2513
02:43:05,356 --> 02:43:08,267
MATT: 23 points of damage, all righty.

2514
02:43:08,267 --> 02:43:10,152
LAURA: That's better.

2515
02:43:10,152 --> 02:43:14,499
MATT: (impact) The lightning slams into his chest,
and you can see it arcs through its scimitar that

2516
02:43:14,499 --> 02:43:18,320
it's holding up in its hand, and it shakes and
almost drops the weapon, and catches its arm as

2517
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:22,691
the electricity disperses out the edge of the
blade and looks back at you. He's now glaring at

2518
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:24,107
both you and Scanlan.

2519
02:43:24,107 --> 02:43:27,969
LAURA: I'm going to use my movement to run up
around the molten lava and hold my hand out for

2520
02:43:27,969 --> 02:43:32,370
Gern, so that he can use me to get out of the
molten lava.

2521
02:43:32,370 --> 02:43:34,174
MATT: All right, that's as far as you can get
there.

2522
02:43:34,174 --> 02:43:35,151
LAURA: Okay.

2523
02:43:35,151 --> 02:43:39,635
MATT: Gern, top of your turn, you take 24 points
of fire damage from the lava as you're sinking

2524
02:43:39,635 --> 02:43:41,974
into it. (sizzling)

2525
02:43:41,974 --> 02:43:48,665
CHRIS: So, can I jump up and then cast a spell?

2526
02:43:48,665 --> 02:43:55,482
MATT: Right now you can try and cast, in this
area, but you would have a hard time

2527
02:43:55,482 --> 02:43:58,452
concentrating. I'd say you'd have to take a
concentration check to even get a spell out,

2528
02:43:58,452 --> 02:44:01,434
because you're in so much pain. I'd say you would
probably want to move out of the lava before you

2529
02:44:01,434 --> 02:44:02,465
do that.

2530
02:44:02,465 --> 02:44:03,959
CHRIS: All right, I'll get out of the lava.

2531
02:44:03,959 --> 02:44:07,125
MATT: So you (straining) stand up.

2532
02:44:07,125 --> 02:44:08,497
LAURA: Take my hand!

2533
02:44:08,497 --> 02:44:13,141
MATT: It's too deep and you're having to basically
wade your way through, which is burning your hands

2534
02:44:13,141 --> 02:44:14,564
as you get over there.

2535
02:44:14,564 --> 02:44:15,897
CHRIS: What about my broom?

2536
02:44:15,897 --> 02:44:20,768
MATT: You were holding your broom! So here's what
you do. You go ahead and you lift yourself up out

2537
02:44:20,768 --> 02:44:26,638
of the lava onto the broom and then (blowing)
push. You're not fully on it, and it's hard to

2538
02:44:26,638 --> 02:44:30,830
engage its mental commands directly with the
current amount of chaos around you, but you do

2539
02:44:30,830 --> 02:44:36,278
manage to skirt yourself to the very edge of the
lava and land on your feet, which are numb after

2540
02:44:36,278 --> 02:44:39,668
the sheer amount of pain you've suffered, and
you don't even want to look down at what you look

2541
02:44:39,668 --> 02:44:40,930
like from the waist below.

2542
02:44:40,930 --> 02:44:42,934
LAURA: Do you need me to hold your broom while you
cast your spell?

2543
02:44:42,934 --> 02:44:44,232
CHRIS: Please!

2544
02:44:44,232 --> 02:44:45,185
LAURA: Thank you!

2545
02:44:45,185 --> 02:44:46,452
SAM: Oh, don't do-- Okay.

2546
02:44:46,452 --> 02:44:48,824
MATT: So she takes the broom from your hand. What
are you going to cast?

2547
02:44:48,824 --> 02:44:50,071
CHRIS: Disintegrate.

2548
02:44:50,071 --> 02:44:51,339
MATT: Okay!

2549
02:44:51,339 --> 02:44:53,064
TRAVIS: Disintegrate?

2550
02:44:53,064 --> 02:44:54,511
SAM: That's a spell?

2551
02:44:54,511 --> 02:44:56,714
LIAM: That's a big one, we've seen that happen.

2552
02:44:56,714 --> 02:44:57,781
SAM: We have?

2553
02:44:57,781 --> 02:44:58,704
MARISHA: Yes.

2554
02:44:58,704 --> 02:44:59,762
SAM: Who did that?

2555
02:44:59,762 --> 02:45:01,336
LIAM: The giants got disintegrated.

2556
02:45:01,336 --> 02:45:03,115
CHRIS: I'm fairly pissed at the moment.

2557
02:45:03,115 --> 02:45:06,877
MATT: As you should be. All right, so you get to
go ahead and roll.

2558
02:45:06,877 --> 02:45:08,733
LIAM: Get the fucker, you dirty bastard.

2559
02:45:08,733 --> 02:45:15,241
MATT: Let me get to the spell here real fast.
Disintegrate. Oh, it just makes a dexterity saving

2560
02:45:15,309 --> 02:45:18,082
throw! It doesn't even get a chance. All right,
what's your spell DC again?

2561
02:45:18,082 --> 02:45:19,297
CHRIS: 16.

2562
02:45:19,297 --> 02:45:21,376
MATT: 16. It rolled a two.

2563
02:45:21,376 --> 02:45:22,815
LAURA: Yes!

2564
02:45:22,815 --> 02:45:29,939
MATT: That's going to be bad. All right, roll 10d6
plus 40 damage. Damn!

2565
02:45:29,939 --> 02:45:31,742
TRAVIS: 10d6?

2566
02:45:31,742 --> 02:45:47,363
MATT: Disintegrate doesn't mess around. It's an
all or nothing spell. If they make the save,

2567
02:45:47,363 --> 02:45:50,327
nothing. You don't make it, (explosion).

2568
02:45:50,327 --> 02:45:53,517
CHRIS: 27, 33, 36... So 76!

2569
02:45:53,517 --> 02:46:00,751
MATT: 76 points of force damage. As you get out,
you can see your vest itself is burning, there's

2570
02:46:00,751 --> 02:46:07,030
still elements of embers burning at the edges of
the leather and the cloth. The bottom part of your

2571
02:46:07,030 --> 02:46:12,198
scales are a combination of blue, black, and
little bits have cracked open where you can see

2572
02:46:12,198 --> 02:46:14,962
red flesh underneath. There's a lot of burn
damage.

2573
02:46:14,962 --> 02:46:17,212
CHRIS: The zippers are very hot, I might add.

2574
02:46:17,212 --> 02:46:22,670
MATT: They're really glowing. However, as you turn
around, as your fin jewelry on the sides of your

2575
02:46:22,670 --> 02:46:27,055
face jangles with the speed as you spin around and
point your finger upward, the arcane energy

2576
02:46:27,055 --> 02:46:33,011
forming at the end of your finger, this singular
beam of dull green arcane energy streaks forward.

2577
02:46:33,011 --> 02:46:39,348
The efreet, who is currently focused on Scanlan
and watching Vex run past, looks down just in time

2578
02:46:39,348 --> 02:46:43,588
to see you release the spell. Opens his eyes and
attempts to dodge out of the way, unfortunately

2579
02:46:43,588 --> 02:46:48,577
not fast enough. It blasts in the side of its
shoulder and you can see as a whole chunk of its

2580
02:46:48,577 --> 02:46:55,835
back muscle, shoulder, and lower torso are just
turned to dust, exposing bone and elements of its

2581
02:46:55,835 --> 02:47:02,522
musculature and flesh underneath. It goes (snarls)
and looks down. It can't even make a loud emission

2582
02:47:02,522 --> 02:47:09,162
of pain, it's just gutturally whispering its
horrible suffering. As it looks down, it reaches

2583
02:47:09,162 --> 02:47:14,906
up with its hand and cauterizes the wound on the
back of its body, leaving it a charred cinder. It

2584
02:47:14,906 --> 02:47:20,639
glares down at you, extremely angry. "I hate you
most of all, scarecrow!"

2585
02:47:20,639 --> 02:47:23,574
CHRIS: Go back to your fire slit!

2586
02:47:23,574 --> 02:47:31,167
MATT: Percy, you're up. Unless you want your dudes
to do anything, by the way. They're still over

2587
02:47:31,167 --> 02:47:32,741
there dancing.

2588
02:47:32,741 --> 02:47:38,316
CHRIS: They should get a little bit closer and
dance in front of him, just to make sure. They get

2589
02:47:38,316 --> 02:47:40,564
very self-conscious if no one's paying attention.

2590
02:47:40,564 --> 02:47:41,999
SAM: Of course.

2591
02:47:41,999 --> 02:47:43,367
MATT: They're just cheering on.

2592
02:47:43,367 --> 02:47:45,134
TRAVIS: At least they're dancing while I'm standing 
on fire.

2593
02:47:45,134 --> 02:47:52,218
TALIESIN: Can I knock him down a notch? Can I try
and shoot him to drop him out of the sky a bit?

2594
02:47:52,218 --> 02:47:53,800
MATT: You can certainly try.

2595
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:58,770
TALIESIN: I'm going to try. First of all, I'm
going to Hex him. He's hexed. I point.

2596
02:47:58,770 --> 02:48:00,095
MATT: All right, so the Hex moves over.

2597
02:48:00,095 --> 02:48:07,673
TALIESIN: Hex moves over. And I'm going to take a
shot to try and drop him. I'm going to take a grit

2598
02:48:07,673 --> 02:48:09,169
shot to drop him.

2599
02:48:09,169 --> 02:48:10,581
MATT: Go for it.

2600
02:48:10,581 --> 02:48:13,960
TALIESIN: That's 22.

2601
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:15,455
MATT: 22 hits.

2602
02:48:15,455 --> 02:48:19,802
TALIESIN: And that's, what's the saving throw for
that? Strength throw.

2603
02:48:19,802 --> 02:48:21,876
MATT: Strength? 23.

2604
02:48:21,876 --> 02:48:23,460
TALIESIN: Aw, really?

2605
02:48:23,460 --> 02:48:24,968
MATT: Yeah. Sorry.

2606
02:48:24,968 --> 02:48:26,730
TALIESIN: That's fine, he'll just take his damage.

2607
02:48:26,730 --> 02:48:29,573
MATT: Little bitch. Plus 1d6, don't forget.

2608
02:48:29,573 --> 02:48:31,335
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you.

2609
02:48:31,335 --> 02:48:33,905
MATT: Wow, Disintegrate spell fucked him up.

2610
02:48:33,905 --> 02:48:37,197
TALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage.

2611
02:48:37,197 --> 02:48:38,468
MATT: Nice.

2612
02:48:38,468 --> 02:48:41,674
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot again.

2613
02:48:41,674 --> 02:48:43,707
MATT: Is this with your pistol?

2614
02:48:43,707 --> 02:48:45,371
TALIESIN: Yeah, just with the pistol right now.

2615
02:48:45,371 --> 02:48:47,199
MATT: And what's your first range increment on
that?

2616
02:48:47,199 --> 02:48:48,665
TALIESIN: 400.

2617
02:48:48,665 --> 02:48:49,843
MATT: The pistol?

2618
02:48:49,843 --> 02:48:51,961
TALIESIN: Yeah. 1,200 for Bad News.

2619
02:48:51,961 --> 02:48:53,863
MATT: Your first range increment.

2620
02:48:53,863 --> 02:48:55,963
TALIESIN: I'm sharpshooter, I have no range
increment.

2621
02:48:55,963 --> 02:48:59,250
MATT: That's right. Good call. All right, so fire
again.

2622
02:48:59,250 --> 02:49:03,565
TALIESIN: Range increments are for-- We don't do
that here.

2623
02:49:03,565 --> 02:49:04,696
MATT: Yeah.

2624
02:49:04,696 --> 02:49:10,858
TALIESIN: That's a 31 to hit.

2625
02:49:10,858 --> 02:49:13,185
MATT: That hits, roll damage. Scanlan, you're up
next, by the way.

2626
02:49:13,185 --> 02:49:17,391
TALIESIN: And that's 16 points of damage.

2627
02:49:17,391 --> 02:49:22,780
MATT: All righty. (two impacts) Just as it manages
to cauterize the wounds from the Disintegrate

2628
02:49:22,780 --> 02:49:27,576
spell, both bullets blast into its torso, and you
can see it's now, thinking the height advantage

2629
02:49:27,576 --> 02:49:32,637
would be helpful, after being locked in a hamster
ball and now being repeatedly blasted from every

2630
02:49:32,637 --> 02:49:36,360
which way, it's not enjoying its current
experience by any means.

2631
02:49:36,360 --> 02:49:39,966
TALIESIN: It's going to get worse. All right, and
now I'm doing a sharpshooter shot.

2632
02:49:39,966 --> 02:49:41,853
MARISHA: Pew pew.

2633
02:49:41,853 --> 02:49:45,466
TALIESIN: Pew pew. That's 18?

2634
02:49:45,466 --> 02:49:47,018
MATT: 18 hits.

2635
02:49:47,018 --> 02:49:56,186
TALIESIN: And that's 12, 18, 28 points of damage.

2636
02:49:56,186 --> 02:50:02,037
MATT: Nice! This one (impact) blasts into the
center of its chest, and you can see part of its

2637
02:50:02,037 --> 02:50:08,538
pectoral muscle tears open and flame erupts from
the impact. It reaches up and (snarling).

2638
02:50:08,538 --> 02:50:18,044
TALIESIN: Action surge. Fuck this guy. Same thing,
sharpshooter. I'm going to be rolling

2639
02:50:18,044 --> 02:50:19,210
sharpshooter.

2640
02:50:19,210 --> 02:50:20,355
MATT: Go for it, okay.

2641
02:50:20,355 --> 02:50:21,425
LIAM: Get the other nipple, now?

2642
02:50:21,425 --> 02:50:22,918
TALIESIN: The other nipple.

2643
02:50:22,918 --> 02:50:24,708
MARISHA: Matching piercings.

2644
02:50:24,708 --> 02:50:26,284
TALIESIN: 22.

2645
02:50:26,284 --> 02:50:30,848
MATT: 22 hits. This is going to be a rough round
for him.

2646
02:50:30,848 --> 02:50:36,270
TALIESIN: 27 points of damage.

2647
02:50:36,270 --> 02:50:38,893
MATT: Ooh!

2648
02:50:38,893 --> 02:50:40,695
TALIESIN: Reload and one more shot!

2649
02:50:40,695 --> 02:50:42,364
LAURA: Jesus Christ! I mean.

2650
02:50:42,364 --> 02:50:43,902
TALIESIN: Reload, one more shot.

2651
02:50:43,902 --> 02:50:45,208
MATT: You got it.

2652
02:50:45,208 --> 02:50:47,790
TALIESIN: That's 17, 27, 29--

2653
02:50:47,790 --> 02:50:50,371
MATT: That's a hit. Go for it, roll damage.

2654
02:50:50,371 --> 02:50:51,515
TALIESIN: That hits.

2655
02:50:51,515 --> 02:50:52,660
MATT: Damn, man.

2656
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:55,825
TALIESIN: 21 points of damage.

2657
02:50:55,825 --> 02:51:01,822
MATT: All right. (two impacts) These holes are
beginning to appear in its body where the bits of

2658
02:51:01,822 --> 02:51:08,455
fiery flesh are being blasted away from the
impacts of your weapon. All right, that brings us

2659
02:51:08,455 --> 02:51:09,888
to Scanlan!

2660
02:51:09,888 --> 02:51:11,156
LAURA: It didn't kill him?

2661
02:51:11,156 --> 02:51:14,723
TALIESIN: No, but he's a sieve now.

2662
02:51:14,723 --> 02:51:16,726
MATT: You guys held him--

2663
02:51:16,726 --> 02:51:20,270
LIAM: He just took 100 points of damage.

2664
02:51:20,270 --> 02:51:21,628
TALIESIN: He took a lot of damage.

2665
02:51:21,628 --> 02:51:28,733
SAM: Hey, that Ioun stone that I have? Does that
allow me to cast a fourth level three spell?

2666
02:51:28,733 --> 02:51:33,121
MATT: If the spell you put into it was a fourth
3rd-level spell, yeah.

2667
02:51:33,121 --> 02:51:35,962
SAM: It was a 3rd-level spell, so it's an extra
3rd-level spell?

2668
02:51:35,962 --> 02:51:37,047
MATT: Right.

2669
02:51:37,047 --> 02:51:40,791
SAM: I'm maxed out on 3rd-level spells, but I
still have that thing.

2670
02:51:40,791 --> 02:51:43,824
MATT: Yeah, so it wouldn't be a 4th-level spell
because you didn't cast into it as a 4th-level.

2671
02:51:43,824 --> 02:51:47,775
SAM: No, I mean, the fourth time I've cast a
3rd-level spell.

2672
02:51:47,775 --> 02:51:50,777
MATT: Oh, got you. It wouldn't count against your
daily. It's in addition to that.

2673
02:51:50,777 --> 02:51:57,250
SAM: Okay! So I will, for the first time ever, use
that stupid Ioun stone and cast Lightning Bolt

2674
02:51:57,250 --> 02:52:00,359
again. I'm just sticking with my method here.

2675
02:52:00,359 --> 02:52:04,595
MATT: All right, all right. With a five, it does
not make its saving throw. Go ahead and roll

2676
02:52:04,595 --> 02:52:06,074
damage. 8d6.

2677
02:52:06,074 --> 02:52:08,426
SAM: 8d6, thank you.

2678
02:52:08,426 --> 02:52:12,956
LIAM: Here comes the cube.

2679
02:52:12,956 --> 02:52:21,397
CHRIS: 23, 28.

2680
02:52:21,397 --> 02:52:25,242
SAM: Thank you. Did you do this one too? 28!

2681
02:52:25,242 --> 02:52:26,991
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2682
02:52:26,991 --> 02:52:28,912
(cheering)

2683
02:52:28,912 --> 02:52:31,493
TRAVIS: Both kills! Both of them!

2684
02:52:31,493 --> 02:52:43,270
SAM: I think I would like to, if there's a way,
I'd like to angle it somehow so that he will drop

2685
02:52:43,270 --> 02:52:50,058
right on top of Grog. I feel like Grog can do
something to a falling behemoth.

2686
02:52:50,058 --> 02:52:53,684
MATT: It's hard-pressed from this angle,
unfortunately. Grog is at an angle where you

2687
02:52:53,684 --> 02:52:55,183
wouldn't really be able to do that.

2688
02:52:55,183 --> 02:52:56,198
SAM: Damn it.

2689
02:52:56,198 --> 02:52:59,611
MATT: Mind you, when you blast him, he'll plummet
close to his feet, if you wanted to.

2690
02:52:59,611 --> 02:53:07,966
SAM: All right, yes, let's do that so Grog can
feel like he gets part of this, too. And if I can,

2691
02:53:07,966 --> 02:53:11,356
I'd like to burn a big S in his chest.

2692
02:53:11,356 --> 02:53:17,630
MATT: So, as you charge up and blast the lightning
bolt from your crotch region, you then do a little

2693
02:53:17,630 --> 02:53:23,194
dance maneuver with your waist, causing it to
(crackling) carve a Scanlan S into the torso of

2694
02:53:23,194 --> 02:53:29,200
the efreet. As it plummets to the ground, slamming
into where the lava would be, while the fire

2695
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:32,874
doesn't hurt its form, you can see, Grog, as it
stands in the ground (groaning). Its form is

2696
02:53:32,874 --> 02:53:37,487
turning into ash around you. It's actually just
dissipating and turning to ash as its eyes roll up

2697
02:53:37,487 --> 02:53:39,019
and meet with yours.

2698
02:53:39,019 --> 02:53:44,489
TRAVIS: I run over in the lava and I go, I'd like
to cast Beheading!

2699
02:53:44,489 --> 02:53:53,445
MATT: All right. You suffer 26 points of fire
damage, reduced to 13 from taking another

2700
02:53:53,445 --> 02:53:54,442
round in there.

2701
02:53:54,442 --> 02:53:57,341
TRAVIS: Not a problem. Totally worth it for the
spell.

2702
02:53:57,341 --> 02:54:00,420
MATT: As you take Craven Edge and take the head
off. As the head rolls away--

2703
02:54:00,420 --> 02:54:01,523
TRAVIS: I grab it!

2704
02:54:01,523 --> 02:54:03,024
MATT: You grab it! It turns to ash.

2705
02:54:03,024 --> 02:54:04,855
TRAVIS: (panting) I run out of the lake.

2706
02:54:04,855 --> 02:54:09,107
MATT: You get out of the lava, stand on the side,
and look over just as the rest of the head turns

2707
02:54:09,107 --> 02:54:10,694
to ashes.

2708
02:54:10,694 --> 02:54:12,056
TRAVIS: Aw, shit.

2709
02:54:12,056 --> 02:54:13,125
LAURA: I walk up to Grog.

2710
02:54:13,125 --> 02:54:14,057
LIAM: You did it again!

2711
02:54:14,057 --> 02:54:19,856
LAURA: I pat him on the shoulder, and say, that
was so impressive. A genuine mage! And I use

2712
02:54:19,856 --> 02:54:26,111
sleight of hand to shove the flying broom into the
Bag of Holding.

2713
02:54:26,111 --> 02:54:27,888
MATT: Okay. Roll sleight of hand.

2714
02:54:27,888 --> 02:54:28,805
TALIESIN: Whoa!

2715
02:54:28,805 --> 02:54:30,063
LIAM: Yeah, girl.

2716
02:54:30,063 --> 02:54:31,422
CHRIS: Am I allowed to roll a perception?

2717
02:54:31,422 --> 02:54:32,403
MATT: Yes, you can.

2718
02:54:32,403 --> 02:54:35,861
LIAM: Come on, Vex. Come on, sister.

2719
02:54:35,861 --> 02:54:37,302
LAURA: 18?

2720
02:54:37,302 --> 02:54:38,425
LIAM: Get it.

2721
02:54:38,425 --> 02:54:41,485
CHRIS: 16.

2722
02:54:41,485 --> 02:54:42,568
MATT: Plus?

2723
02:54:42,568 --> 02:54:43,502
TALIESIN: No.

2724
02:54:43,502 --> 02:54:44,575
MATT: Total of 16?

2725
02:54:44,575 --> 02:54:45,697
CHRIS: 15 plus one, yeah.

2726
02:54:45,697 --> 02:54:51,366
MATT: As you're dealing with this, you have no
notice of this. You may question it later, if you

2727
02:54:51,366 --> 02:54:54,776
like, but you have no idea where it went, and
didn't see any of this transaction happen.

2728
02:54:54,776 --> 02:54:58,195
LAURA: Oh no! Oh no!

2729
02:54:58,195 --> 02:54:59,509
SAM: What, what is it?

2730
02:54:59,509 --> 02:55:01,338
LAURA: Your broom fell in the lava!

2731
02:55:01,338 --> 02:55:02,598
CHRIS: What?

2732
02:55:02,598 --> 02:55:03,709
LAURA: I saw it!

2733
02:55:03,709 --> 02:55:05,044
CHRIS: I just turned around for a moment!

2734
02:55:05,044 --> 02:55:06,779
LAURA: I tried to give it back to you and it fell
in the lava!

2735
02:55:06,779 --> 02:55:07,761
CHRIS: Are you sure?

2736
02:55:07,761 --> 02:55:08,556
LAURA: Yeah!

2737
02:55:08,556 --> 02:55:09,830
MATT: Make a deception check.

2738
02:55:09,830 --> 02:55:11,363
SAM: You shouldn't have looked at me when I cast
my spell!

2739
02:55:11,363 --> 02:55:12,823
CHRIS: This is why I never looked at you before!

2740
02:55:12,823 --> 02:55:14,147
SAM: I was wrong to doubt you!

2741
02:55:14,147 --> 02:55:18,355
CHRIS: No! No, you're a constant source of
disappointment!

2742
02:55:18,355 --> 02:55:19,546
LAURA: 18.

2743
02:55:19,546 --> 02:55:21,356
CHRIS: Where's my fucking broom?

2744
02:55:21,356 --> 02:55:22,835
MATT: Make an insight check now.

2745
02:55:22,835 --> 02:55:28,363
CHRIS: Insight. 13.

2746
02:55:28,363 --> 02:55:33,837
MATT: 13. She's telling the truth, man. That broom
just went straight in the lava.

2747
02:55:33,837 --> 02:55:35,463
SAM: You're a horrible person.

2748
02:55:35,463 --> 02:55:38,803
CHRIS: You know, I'm really good at reading
people, and I know that you're telling me the

2749
02:55:38,803 --> 02:55:39,985
truth right now.

2750
02:55:39,985 --> 02:55:41,401
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

2751
02:55:41,401 --> 02:55:48,732
CHRIS: No, I feel your sorrow. I feel it. I feel
bad for you, that you have to experience that!

2752
02:55:48,732 --> 02:55:54,310
It's just a broom. Right? It's just a flying broom
that's very difficult to find, no big deal.

2753
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:56,700
LAURA: I wouldn't know. I don't even know.

2754
02:55:56,700 --> 02:56:02,340
CHRIS: That's all right. You know, it actually--
It sterilized me, actually, I'm quite glad. It has

2755
02:56:02,340 --> 02:56:09,171
very dirty properties. Anyone that would put it
between their legs to fly around would be in

2756
02:56:09,171 --> 02:56:13,243
horrible danger. Horrible danger. So it's actually
probably for the better.

2757
02:56:13,243 --> 02:56:14,520
SAM: Communicable diseases?

2758
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:21,931
CHRIS: Yeah, so many STDs. It's really just like a
disease tampon, is really what it is.

2759
02:56:21,931 --> 02:56:25,437
LIAM: A what? Is that like a magic candle?

2760
02:56:25,437 --> 02:56:27,850
CHRIS: It's sort of like a magic candle.

2761
02:56:27,850 --> 02:56:29,483
LAURA: A tragedy candle.

2762
02:56:29,483 --> 02:56:30,844
CHRIS: It's a tragedy candle.

2763
02:56:30,844 --> 02:56:32,078
TALIESIN: A Blanston candle.

2764
02:56:32,078 --> 02:56:33,002
CHRIS: Yes.

2765
02:56:33,002 --> 02:56:34,773
LIAM: I don't understand sorcery at all.

2766
02:56:34,773 --> 02:56:40,112
MATT: At this point, you hear the flickering of
flame and the portal itself has begun to expand

2767
02:56:40,112 --> 02:56:42,091
even further, glowing brighter.

2768
02:56:42,091 --> 02:56:48,143
MARISHA: Keyleth throws up a Skywrite spell and
says, we're taking the portal.

2769
02:56:48,143 --> 02:56:58,648
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, the flames
themselves grow higher and higher. The lava begins

2770
02:56:58,648 --> 02:57:03,703
to boil and roil. As you guys all move up to the
side, you can see the lava is beginning to

2771
02:57:03,703 --> 02:57:08,659
(bubbling) splash out and spray bits are starting
to scatter as some of the nearby trees tumble

2772
02:57:08,659 --> 02:57:14,364
over. You can see the four Fire Ashari as well as
Korren come across one of the clearings. The other

2773
02:57:14,364 --> 02:57:20,011
way, you see what looks to be another salamander
gets thrown about 15 feet from the trees, hits the

2774
02:57:20,011 --> 02:57:26,660
ground, skids, and is motionless as you see
Cerkonos with the rest of the Pyrah, the Fire

2775
02:57:26,660 --> 02:57:33,270
Ashari stepping through. "Keyleth. We saw your
symbol. Is it time?"

2776
02:57:33,270 --> 02:57:34,530
MARISHA: Yes.

2777
02:57:34,530 --> 02:57:39,668
MATT: "All right. Let us try to close this rift."
And the rest of the druids all begin to gather

2778
02:57:39,668 --> 02:57:45,471
around the outside of this portal. As it's
flickering, you can see, piercing into the

2779
02:57:45,471 --> 02:57:50,156
extremely blinding light, Keyleth, you take a
moment, and using your attachment to the Fire

2780
02:57:50,156 --> 02:57:55,666
Ashari and the Fire Elemental Plane from your last
passage through it, you can see past the

2781
02:57:55,666 --> 02:58:01,191
brightness and see beyond the doorway. You can see
on the other side, there appears to be probably

2782
02:58:01,191 --> 02:58:05,403
another half dozen or a dozen or so of a few other
elementals and salamanders that are now making

2783
02:58:05,403 --> 02:58:07,045
their way towards the portal.

2784
02:58:07,045 --> 02:58:13,330
MARISHA: I stand next to my father and join the
rest of the druids.

2785
02:58:13,330 --> 02:58:15,924
LAURA: Grog, you should probably help them with
all of your magic powers.

2786
02:58:15,924 --> 02:58:17,814
TRAVIS: Do you think so? It feels like it's an
intimate thing.

2787
02:58:17,814 --> 02:58:19,364
LAURA: Just hold your hands up, hold your hands
up.

2788
02:58:19,364 --> 02:58:20,590
TRAVIS: All right.

2789
02:58:20,590 --> 02:58:26,694
MATT: All right. As the rest of the Ashari begin
to gather around the portal and concentrate, they

2790
02:58:26,694 --> 02:58:33,112
are managing to hold the rift in its current size.
You see as beads of sweat begin to pour down

2791
02:58:33,112 --> 02:58:39,117
Korren's face, not used to this type of terrain.
He goes (gasps), "We need more power!"

2792
02:58:39,117 --> 02:58:40,579
TRAVIS: Okay!

2793
02:58:40,579 --> 02:58:45,243
MATT: "If you can aid, whatever you have to bring
to this, please, now is the time!" Does anyone

2794
02:58:45,243 --> 02:58:46,666
wish to help with the ritual?

2795
02:58:46,666 --> 02:58:47,684
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

2796
02:58:47,684 --> 02:58:48,789
CHRIS: I'll help.

2797
02:58:48,789 --> 02:58:50,549
MATT: All right, how would you wish to help?

2798
02:58:50,549 --> 02:58:54,905
SAM: What a nice guy he is! Certainly not someone
we should swindle!

2799
02:58:54,905 --> 02:58:58,228
LIAM: Strange that you would say that.

2800
02:58:58,228 --> 02:59:00,333
CHRIS: I would know if someone were trying to
swindle me, believe me.

2801
02:59:00,333 --> 02:59:01,611
SAM: That's true. That is true!

2802
02:59:01,611 --> 02:59:05,705
CHRIS: You all have honest faces. Particularly
her, over there. Very honest face. What can I do

2803
02:59:05,705 --> 02:59:07,157
to help?

2804
02:59:07,157 --> 02:59:12,977
MATT: What do you think would lend itself to a
fire gate-sealing ritual? It could be a spell, it

2805
02:59:12,977 --> 02:59:15,437
could be a use of a skill. How would you like to--?

2806
02:59:15,437 --> 02:59:17,497
SAM: A candle? Do you have any candles that could
aid?

2807
02:59:17,497 --> 02:59:19,204
LAURA: Like fiery candles, maybe?

2808
02:59:19,204 --> 02:59:28,275
CHRIS: I have a-- No, this one casts-- This is
bright light, there's a thunder candle. Blink

2809
02:59:28,275 --> 02:59:33,045
candle. Destroy-- No, that destroys dexterity. I
have a thunder candle, but I don't know if that

2810
02:59:33,045 --> 02:59:34,349
would work.

2811
02:59:34,349 --> 02:59:41,006
MATT: Make an arcana check.

2812
02:59:41,006 --> 02:59:44,330
CHRIS: 19.

2813
02:59:44,330 --> 02:59:50,129
MATT: 19. The Blink candle, which you crafted from
various parts from blink dogs and other creatures

2814
02:59:50,129 --> 02:59:55,141
that have natural translocation capabilities,
might have the capability, as this is a doorway

2815
02:59:55,141 --> 03:00:00,577
between planes, and teleportation magic is based
on creating short-form doorways between similar

2816
03:00:00,577 --> 03:00:04,429
spaces, might have some impact on the ritual if
used properly.

2817
03:00:04,429 --> 03:00:10,548
CHRIS: I have this Blink candle. It's formed from
various animals that blink and if-- that has

2818
03:00:10,548 --> 03:00:17,354
trans-dimensional properties, very good
properties. The best kind of robust properties

2819
03:00:17,354 --> 03:00:24,467
that I can throw it in, and it might help stop
the-- from-- all of that.

2820
03:00:24,467 --> 03:00:26,436
TRAVIS: That makes perfect sense.

2821
03:00:26,436 --> 03:00:29,239
CHRIS: Right. So we're all in agreement, then.

2822
03:00:29,239 --> 03:00:30,932
SAM: Well-explained!

2823
03:00:30,932 --> 03:00:38,667
CHRIS: All right. So I'm going to hand Blink
candle to Coral and I'm going to have Coral walk

2824
03:00:38,667 --> 03:00:40,877
into the portal.

2825
03:00:40,877 --> 03:00:42,230
TRAVIS: Brave Coral.

2826
03:00:42,230 --> 03:00:46,782
CHRIS: Brave Coral. Fuck, I've lost two and my
broom. What a fucking terrible day.

2827
03:00:46,782 --> 03:00:58,673
MATT: As Coral takes the candle, (groans) turns
around and begins to just slowly melt, steps into

2828
03:00:58,673 --> 03:00:59,904
the lava.

2829
03:00:59,904 --> 03:01:01,670
LIAM: Run, Coral, run!

2830
03:01:01,670 --> 03:01:07,434
MATT: Nine points of fire damage to Coral who was
already sitting at--

2831
03:01:07,434 --> 03:01:10,576
CHRIS: Six.

2832
03:01:10,576 --> 03:01:16,891
MATT: And had taken six damage, right? So 15
from 33. Coral's at half health. Coral, as this is

2833
03:01:16,891 --> 03:01:22,447
rough terrain, gets part of the way there,
then continues walking forward the rest of the

2834
03:01:22,447 --> 03:01:29,360
way. Takes an additional 17 points of damage.

2835
03:01:29,360 --> 03:01:30,751
LAURA: Oh no.

2836
03:01:30,751 --> 03:01:40,806
MATT: So that's 32 points of damage. What's
Coral's hitpoints? 33 is the max?

2837
03:01:40,806 --> 03:01:42,939
LAURA: That's what you said.

2838
03:01:42,939 --> 03:01:50,682
MATT: Yep. On the sheet right there. I can read my own
text. 33 hit points. Coral, at one hitpoint, gets

2839
03:01:50,682 --> 03:01:57,755
up to the lava, take the candle and (boof). As
the energy expands from it, you can see a ripple,

2840
03:01:57,755 --> 03:02:05,756
a heat wave ripple, that billows outward. Coral
vanishes entirely and the portal shrinks down by

2841
03:02:05,756 --> 03:02:09,701
about five to six feet, actually closing in its
space

2842
03:02:09,701 --> 03:02:12,024
CHRIS: Oh, Coral, I forgot to tell you somethi--
fuck.

2843
03:02:12,024 --> 03:02:19,182
MATT: Suddenly you hear a (zip) and Coral appears
about ten, 15 feet in the air--

2844
03:02:19,182 --> 03:02:23,118
CHRIS: Oh good, there you are. Listen, did you see
my broom?

2845
03:02:23,118 --> 03:02:35,610
MATT: Smack! Coral falls those 15 feet, taking six
points of bludgeoning damage. Let's see if Coral

2846
03:02:35,610 --> 03:02:46,406
survives this with Undead Fortitude. Nope. That is
a roll of eight versus a total DC of 11 with the

2847
03:02:46,406 --> 03:02:53,743
damage taken, and Coral just splats like a really,
really old orange just slammed into the concrete,

2848
03:02:53,743 --> 03:02:55,382
just (splatting).

2849
03:02:55,382 --> 03:02:59,166
TRAVIS: Like an old orange.

2850
03:02:59,166 --> 03:03:05,056
MATT: One of the Fire Ashari goes (cringing,
gagging) and just ends up concentrating on holding

2851
03:03:05,056 --> 03:03:06,429
the gate.

2852
03:03:06,429 --> 03:03:09,264
CHRIS: I'm starting to think you're all very bad
luck.

2853
03:03:09,264 --> 03:03:12,644
MATT: However, that did aid the ritual. We have
two more folks who could aid in this ritual.

2854
03:03:12,644 --> 03:03:18,914
LAURA: I can use-- I don't know if it will help,
but I have a really great diamond of awesomeness

2855
03:03:18,914 --> 03:03:20,987
that's precious.

2856
03:03:20,987 --> 03:03:22,833
MATT: How would that help the ritual?

2857
03:03:22,833 --> 03:03:23,953
LAURA: I don't know.

2858
03:03:23,953 --> 03:03:27,490
MARISHA: Am I a part of the people who could be
included in the ritual too?

2859
03:03:27,490 --> 03:03:28,766
MATT: Yeah. Oh yeah.

2860
03:03:28,766 --> 03:03:36,813
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to cast a 7th-level
Plane Shift to help smush it closed.

2861
03:03:36,813 --> 03:03:41,855
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a nature roll
with advantage. This is your understanding of

2862
03:03:41,855 --> 03:03:46,750
the natural elements of the world around you and
the connection you have with the fire elemental plane.

2863
03:03:46,750 --> 03:03:49,279
LAURA: I don't know how this magic stuff works.

2864
03:03:49,279 --> 03:03:53,141
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll teach you later.

2865
03:03:53,141 --> 03:03:57,064
MARISHA: 12. Oh, with advantage. 23

2866
03:03:57,064 --> 03:04:05,007
MATT: 23. As you begin to concentrate, your hands
instinctively burst into flames to coalesce your

2867
03:04:05,007 --> 03:04:10,243
connection to the Fire Elemental Plane. As you
complete the Plane Shift spell, your form shimmers

2868
03:04:10,243 --> 03:04:14,923
for a second, and for a moment it looks like she's
only partially there. She's actually translucent,

2869
03:04:14,923 --> 03:04:19,726
as flames begin to lick up the sides of her body.
At this point, you can see the lava flow in the

2870
03:04:19,726 --> 03:04:25,283
mountain begins to slow and the bubbling begins to
come to a stillness. The portal itself shimmers

2871
03:04:25,283 --> 03:04:31,621
again and then shrinks down to the size of a
normal doorway, about five foot by ten foot tall,

2872
03:04:31,621 --> 03:04:35,775
and it's just barely holding on. As you're
concentrating on holding it in its place, you can

2873
03:04:35,775 --> 03:04:40,813
see now the rest of the druids around are sweating
profusely. Who wishes to take on the last part of

2874
03:04:40,813 --> 03:04:42,042
this ritual?

2875
03:04:42,042 --> 03:04:48,784
TRAVIS: I have a Firebrand Warhammer. I could hit
it. Anybody else got anything better?

2876
03:04:48,784 --> 03:04:50,497
LAURA: Do you have any magic stuff, Scanlan?

2877
03:04:50,497 --> 03:04:54,771
SAM: I can inspire them. I mean...

2878
03:04:54,771 --> 03:04:57,213
TRAVIS: Your Dimension Door?

2879
03:04:57,213 --> 03:04:59,380
MARISHA: Do you have your Dimension Door?

2880
03:04:59,380 --> 03:05:00,960
SAM: Dimension Door what?

2881
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:04,941
MARISHA: A door. I did Planar Binding, which
technically really wasn't supposed to do what I

2882
03:05:04,941 --> 03:05:06,045
just did--

2883
03:05:06,045 --> 03:05:07,310
MATT: Planar Shift you said.

2884
03:05:07,310 --> 03:05:09,284
MARISHA: Planar Shift, I mean, yes. 7th-level.

2885
03:05:09,284 --> 03:05:12,916
MATT: Finding ways to tailor magic essences into
this type of a ritual.

2886
03:05:12,916 --> 03:05:19,064
SAM: Do I know that that will work or help?

2887
03:05:19,064 --> 03:05:25,101
MATT: You don't know. You'll find out. However you
wish to aid this ritual and justify how it would

2888
03:05:25,101 --> 03:05:26,861
be helpful in this instance.

2889
03:05:26,861 --> 03:05:30,592
LIAM: There's something I could do.

2890
03:05:30,592 --> 03:05:34,591
TRAVIS: Yeah, spit it up.

2891
03:05:34,591 --> 03:05:42,139
LIAM: I whip the Cape of the Mountebank out of my
pocket and run at that door and jump off the edge

2892
03:05:42,139 --> 03:05:46,521
and just try to balloon umbrella it down over with
that red cape.

2893
03:05:46,521 --> 03:05:51,435
MATT: Hmm. Okay.

2894
03:05:51,435 --> 03:05:53,255
LAURA: Matador it.

2895
03:05:53,255 --> 03:05:55,449
LIAM: I'm doing it. I'm matadoring it.

2896
03:05:55,449 --> 03:06:03,471
MATT: Okay. I will say-- hmm. How do I make this
work? I'm going to want you to go ahead and make

2897
03:06:03,471 --> 03:06:05,866
an acrobatics check.

2898
03:06:05,866 --> 03:06:09,307
LIAM: Okay. That is a 25.

2899
03:06:09,307 --> 03:06:14,681
MATT: All right. You rush up, leaping off the
side, spinning in the air. As you, do you unfurl

2900
03:06:14,681 --> 03:06:20,699
the cape and turn it into a limited parachute-type
projection and as you slam it down towards-- I

2901
03:06:20,699 --> 03:06:31,269
need you to go ahead and make a wisdom check to
see if you have the capability of triggering the

2902
03:06:31,269 --> 03:06:34,190
magic of the item at the right time to be
impactful.

2903
03:06:34,190 --> 03:06:35,464
LIAM: Cross your fingers, everybody.

2904
03:06:35,464 --> 03:06:36,422
TRAVIS: Come on, Vax.

2905
03:06:36,422 --> 03:06:37,907
LIAM: No bonuses here.

2906
03:06:37,907 --> 03:06:39,185
CHRIS: No whammys.

2907
03:06:39,185 --> 03:06:42,862
MARISHA: We don't still have our fancy feast, do
we?

2908
03:06:42,862 --> 03:06:44,606
SAM: Oh, yeah, are we still feasting?

2909
03:06:44,606 --> 03:06:46,259
MATT: Yeah.

2910
03:06:46,259 --> 03:06:48,164
LIAM: So what does that mean? Advantage.

2911
03:06:48,164 --> 03:06:49,867
MARISHA: You have advantage on wisdom throws.

2912
03:06:49,867 --> 03:06:53,442
LIAM: That's better. That is 13.

2913
03:06:53,442 --> 03:07:02,562
MATT: 13? That's better. As you come down, you
take the cape and encase, you trigger the magic,

2914
03:07:02,562 --> 03:07:11,695
at which point the remainder of this doorway just
blinks out entirely, the cape gone. The doorway, gone.

2915
03:07:11,695 --> 03:07:13,607
LIAM: Hot hot hot hot hot.

2916
03:07:13,607 --> 03:07:17,181
MATT: As Vax (splashing) right into the lava.

2917
03:07:17,181 --> 03:07:21,241
MARISHA: I take a Grasping Vine from the edge and
try and yank him back.

2918
03:07:21,241 --> 03:07:25,770
MATT: Okay. You take 22 points of fire damage as
you splat into the lava.

2919
03:07:25,770 --> 03:07:31,443
LIAM: The Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire.

2920
03:07:31,443 --> 03:07:37,437
MATT: So it resisted to 11. So you
(splashing) in the lava. All of a sudden, images

2921
03:07:37,437 --> 03:07:40,555
flash in your head of the time that you lost most
of your foot in the Underdark. And you go--

2922
03:07:40,555 --> 03:07:42,650
LIAM: No no no no no no no no!

2923
03:07:42,650 --> 03:07:45,393
MATT: And, before you can even react, all of a
sudden, something wraps around your waist and

2924
03:07:45,393 --> 03:07:50,780
yanks you out as a vine pulls you in an arc and
slams you into the hard obsidian floor on the

2925
03:07:50,780 --> 03:07:55,656
outside of the lava flow. The rest of you gather
there as the rest of the druids finish their

2926
03:07:55,656 --> 03:08:02,388
concentration. The lava pools themselves have gone
still and you can see elements beginning to cool,

2927
03:08:02,388 --> 03:08:05,753
and there's currently no sign of a tear between
the elemental planes that's

2928
03:08:05,753 --> 03:08:07,776
currently bursting through.

2929
03:08:07,776 --> 03:08:09,419
TRAVIS: Nice job, Vax!

2930
03:08:09,419 --> 03:08:11,231
LIAM: Where am I, am I near her, on the ground?

2931
03:08:11,231 --> 03:08:15,538
MATT: She would be back here. You're on the
ground, right next to a dancing skeleton.

2932
03:08:15,538 --> 03:08:19,181
MARISHA: I moved up, I moved up. I would be over
there.

2933
03:08:19,181 --> 03:08:21,657
MATT: You would be part of the ritual. But you
fell next to the dancing skeleton.

2934
03:08:21,657 --> 03:08:28,086
LIAM: Okay, I look at the skeleton, I look at her.
I look at the skeleton, I look at her.

2935
03:08:28,086 --> 03:08:30,913
I'm an idiot.

2936
03:08:30,913 --> 03:08:38,276
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I already knew that. It's fine.
You did good. You did good. I reach down and I

2937
03:08:38,276 --> 03:08:42,082
help him on his feet. How bad are you?

2938
03:08:42,082 --> 03:08:45,052
LIAM: I'm pretty bad.

2939
03:08:45,052 --> 03:08:50,169
MARISHA: I Cure Wounds, level four.

2940
03:08:50,169 --> 03:08:53,404
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool, do that. I'm going to walk out
of the lava now.

2941
03:08:53,404 --> 03:08:56,183
(laughter)

2942
03:08:56,183 --> 03:09:12,437
MATT: Taking another 21 points of fire damage.
Reduced to ten. The druids look around and give a

2943
03:09:12,437 --> 03:09:16,979
nod of acceptance. All of them acknowledge you,
who they have not met and don't understand quite

2944
03:09:16,979 --> 03:09:22,422
where you came from or why you're here. One of
them, who is currently missing an arm on one hand.

2945
03:09:22,422 --> 03:09:29,402
Dark, weathered skin, long jet black hair cruising
down to the middle of his back, approaches you and

2946
03:09:29,402 --> 03:09:35,313
his one right arm he puts on the shoulder and
says, into your eyes, "I do not know you, friend,

2947
03:09:35,313 --> 03:09:40,259
"but you have come to our aid at an hour when we
really required it."

2948
03:09:40,259 --> 03:09:47,084
CHRIS: Great, sure, I just thought I'd come and
lose a couple of thralls and my fucking broom. But

2949
03:09:47,084 --> 03:09:50,691
great to be here. Everyone seems nice. Especially
her, she's great.

2950
03:09:50,691 --> 03:09:56,035
MATT: He removes his hand. "Very well."

2951
03:09:56,035 --> 03:09:58,515
CHRIS: Let me know if I can do anything else! Do
you want a candle?

2952
03:09:58,515 --> 03:10:00,220
MATT: "Candle?"

2953
03:10:00,220 --> 03:10:03,466
CHRIS: Well, I make candles, just various candles.

2954
03:10:03,466 --> 03:10:09,529
MATT: He does this and his finger bursts into
flame and you can see a flame flickering. "We do

2955
03:10:09,529 --> 03:10:12,241
"not need candles here in Pyrah. But thank you."

2956
03:10:12,241 --> 03:10:16,210
LIAM: Is that the finger? Or is that the finger?

2957
03:10:16,210 --> 03:10:25,390
MATT: Insinuated, actual finger. At this point,
Korren, your father, approaches you and places a

2958
03:10:25,390 --> 03:10:28,985
hand on your shoulder, and turns you around to
look you in the face. And you can see there's

2959
03:10:28,985 --> 03:10:34,916
smears of dirt and still glistening from sweat
from the whole ritual and looks a bit weathered

2960
03:10:34,916 --> 03:10:40,687
and winded from the experience. "Keyleth, I'm
proud of you."

2961
03:10:40,687 --> 03:10:44,642
MARISHA: Thank you, Father.

2962
03:10:44,642 --> 03:10:52,370
MATT: I think we will stay here and help the Pyrah
try and rebuild.

2963
03:10:52,370 --> 03:10:57,140
MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

2964
03:10:57,140 --> 03:11:03,265
MATT: And he takes your chin and pulls it up and
looks you in the face with a broad smile on his

2965
03:11:03,265 --> 03:11:13,161
face, he says, "The road before you, Keyleth, is
hard and fraught with loss and sadness. To live is

2966
03:11:13,161 --> 03:11:21,235
"to struggle against the void. But it's those
moments of darkness that define the joy of the

2967
03:11:21,235 --> 03:11:33,439
"world around them. Learn from the loss and push
forward as a beacon of perseverance, of hope for

2968
03:11:33,439 --> 03:11:43,134
"life after pain. This is one of the pillars of
strength of a leader. One that I have learned with the

2969
03:11:43,134 --> 03:11:53,082
"loss of your mother. But you are my beacon of
hope. And to many more than you even expect." And

2970
03:11:53,082 --> 03:11:57,564
he looks back towards the four other members of the
Zephrah tribe that are all just looking at you,

2971
03:11:57,564 --> 03:11:59,173
and they nod.

2972
03:11:59,173 --> 03:12:03,734
MARISHA: I hope I do not fail you, Father.

2973
03:12:03,734 --> 03:12:14,258
MATT: "I trust you will not. Go forth, while we
stay here. I want you to grasp your destiny,

2974
03:12:14,258 --> 03:12:25,001
"vanquish this terrible beast that lies on the
shores of Tal'Dorei. Complete your Aramente."

2975
03:12:25,001 --> 03:12:28,651
MARISHA: How do you know that this is my destiny?

2976
03:12:28,651 --> 03:12:39,141
MATT: "Whatever your destiny is, grasp it. But
you've chosen this path, and all destiny really

2977
03:12:39,141 --> 03:12:50,709
"is, is the choices you make, leading towards a
goal that perhaps you do not yet understand. But

2978
03:12:50,709 --> 03:12:54,748
"when you've returned I wish for you to teach us
the wisdom you've gained on this journey."

2979
03:12:54,748 --> 03:12:59,447
MARISHA: Kaitiaki, father.

2980
03:12:59,447 --> 03:13:01,471
MATT: "Kaitiaki, Keyleth."

2981
03:13:01,471 --> 03:13:05,088
CHRIS: Did you see a broom lying around anywhere?

2982
03:13:05,088 --> 03:13:08,558
MATT: "No."

2983
03:13:08,558 --> 03:13:11,624
CHRIS: Sorry.

2984
03:13:11,624 --> 03:13:14,608
MATT: "It's all right, we will keep an eye out for
it though."

2985
03:13:14,608 --> 03:13:20,969
CHRIS: Please. And tell everyone #feelthegern.
They'll know what it means.

2986
03:13:20,969 --> 03:13:22,328
SAM: What is a hashtag?

2987
03:13:22,328 --> 03:13:23,394
CHRIS: I'll explain later.

2988
03:13:23,394 --> 03:13:24,854
SAM: All right.

2989
03:13:24,854 --> 03:13:38,933
MATT: "Well, unless there's anything else, we have
business to attend to in restoring this area. I

2990
03:13:38,933 --> 03:13:41,809
"wish you all great luck. "

2991
03:13:41,809 --> 03:13:56,154
MARISHA: Korren, If we should ever need you-- if I
should ever need you, or the assistance of the

2992
03:13:56,154 --> 03:14:00,325
Ashari, what is the best way to get hold of you?

2993
03:14:00,325 --> 03:14:12,130
MATT: "Call to Zephrah. Come home. And we will
come with you." As he looks over all of you,

2994
03:14:12,130 --> 03:14:16,468
giving each a look of-- a nod of respect and
appreciation--

2995
03:14:16,468 --> 03:14:20,591
("Don't You" by Simple Minds plays)

2996
03:14:20,591 --> 03:14:22,029
LIAM: Wow.

2997
03:14:22,029 --> 03:14:23,326
TALIESIN: I felt it coming.

2998
03:14:23,326 --> 03:14:34,405
MATT: Glances past to Grog, Vex, and lingers a
very long look on Vax, and just gives you a nod.

2999
03:14:34,405 --> 03:14:39,176
LAURA: His diamond earring is glistening in the
light.

3000
03:14:39,176 --> 03:14:40,773
MATT: Yeah.

3001
03:14:40,773 --> 03:14:45,205
LIAM: Did I stutter?

3002
03:14:45,205 --> 03:15:00,999
MATT: "Stay safe. For her sake." And Korren turns
around and walks back, as the rest of the Zephrah

3003
03:15:00,999 --> 03:15:10,797
Ashari walk along with him. You, through all this
chaos, get a little bored and frustrated with all

3004
03:15:10,797 --> 03:15:17,562
this weird nonsensical stuff, look at the ground
and realize there's a lot of hidden treasures

3005
03:15:17,562 --> 03:15:20,026
scattered amongst this vicinity.

3006
03:15:20,026 --> 03:15:30,890
CHRIS: Probably so. You know, I might stay behind
a bit and dig around for a little while. You know,

3007
03:15:30,890 --> 03:15:32,790
candlemaking's a difficult business.

3008
03:15:32,790 --> 03:15:33,748
SAM: Is it now?

3009
03:15:33,748 --> 03:15:34,888
CHRIS: Aye.

3010
03:15:34,888 --> 03:15:39,022
TALIESIN: Well, if you're ever looking for more
customers, you'll always find them in Whitestone.

3011
03:15:39,022 --> 03:15:41,330
So, if you make your way north.

3012
03:15:41,330 --> 03:15:42,535
CHRIS: Excellent!

3013
03:15:42,535 --> 03:15:43,888
TALIESIN: You're always welcome.

3014
03:15:43,888 --> 03:15:48,789
CHRIS: Thank you. Could someone heal me a bit
before you leave? I'm quite singed.

3015
03:15:48,789 --> 03:15:50,251
TALIESIN: Oh my!

3016
03:15:50,251 --> 03:15:53,591
LAURA: I walk up and I cast Cure Wounds on him. I've
got jack shit.

3017
03:15:53,591 --> 03:15:55,216
CHRIS: She's so nice!

3018
03:15:55,216 --> 03:15:56,373
SAM: She's great.

3019
03:15:56,373 --> 03:15:57,229
CHRIS: She's the nicest!

3020
03:15:57,229 --> 03:15:58,801
LAURA: At a level three for you!

3021
03:15:58,801 --> 03:16:01,987
CHRIS: That's really nice of you.

3022
03:16:01,987 --> 03:16:03,699
TRAVIS: You're a really good person.

3023
03:16:03,699 --> 03:16:07,551
LAURA: I am! I am. 20 points.

3024
03:16:07,551 --> 03:16:09,199
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

3025
03:16:09,199 --> 03:16:10,554
SAM: Vex?

3026
03:16:10,554 --> 03:16:11,481
LAURA: Yes?

3027
03:16:11,481 --> 03:16:13,857
SAM: This gentleman has done nothing but aid us.

3028
03:16:13,857 --> 03:16:15,887
LAURA: I know, and it's so kind of him.

3029
03:16:15,887 --> 03:16:17,387
SAM: He's suffered the loss of three of his--

3030
03:16:17,387 --> 03:16:20,663
LAURA: Look at all these treasures he's going to
find here for his candles!

3031
03:16:20,663 --> 03:16:22,104
SAM: Is there anything we can do to repay you?

3032
03:16:22,104 --> 03:16:23,974
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3033
03:16:23,974 --> 03:16:31,488
TRAVIS: That scimitar that the genie had, did it
fall into the lava?

3034
03:16:31,488 --> 03:16:36,975
MATT: Yes.

3035
03:16:36,975 --> 03:16:38,284
LAURA: 18.

3036
03:16:38,284 --> 03:16:42,233
MATT: As you look down and say "all these
treasures around," you get a closer look. The

3037
03:16:42,233 --> 03:16:48,947
ground here is rugged rock and black ash and dust
and pieces of charred and burnt, petrified wood,

3038
03:16:48,947 --> 03:16:56,497
and right around the outskirts of where the lava
pool is, you can see what look to be broken slivers

3039
03:16:56,497 --> 03:17:08,055
of soot-covered dragon scale just peppered
throughout the landscape. Barely visible until you

3040
03:17:08,055 --> 03:17:14,585
look real close, thanks to the constant barrage of
blacken soot and dust that falls from the nearby area.

3041
03:17:14,585 --> 03:17:20,083
LAURA: Do you collect dragon scales for your
candles?

3042
03:17:20,083 --> 03:17:24,141
CHRIS: Oh, I forgot to tell you. I sold out my own
kind because I was enslaved by dragons who had

3043
03:17:24,141 --> 03:17:27,501
tails who consider themselves royalty and
therefore better than me and I don't have a tail.

3044
03:17:27,501 --> 03:17:32,879
And so I spent my whole life trying to figure out how to
turn scales into weaponized candles. Anyway, got

3045
03:17:32,924 --> 03:17:36,810
to go, everyone have a great time! Thank you!

3046
03:17:36,810 --> 03:17:38,748
MATT: You just leave?

3047
03:17:38,748 --> 03:17:44,186
CHRIS: I leave! Scoop up some of the few scales
and piss off.

3048
03:17:44,186 --> 03:17:52,025
MATT: You guys watch as Gern Blanston begins
walking around and, like a gutter snipe, or one of

3049
03:17:52,025 --> 03:17:55,261
the people on the beach with a metal detector,
starts combing through.

3050
03:17:55,261 --> 03:17:56,720
CHRIS: (singing) Don't you forget about me!

3051
03:17:56,720 --> 03:17:59,877
LAURA: Gern! Before you leave!

3052
03:17:59,877 --> 03:18:00,983
CHRIS: Aye?

3053
03:18:00,983 --> 03:18:05,966
LAURA: You know, we're killing a very, very large
dragon, hopefully rather soon.

3054
03:18:05,966 --> 03:18:08,481
CHRIS: Very interesting! Where would that be?

3055
03:18:08,481 --> 03:18:11,219
LAURA: Well, he's in Emon now, but we're gathering
our forces in Whitestone.

3056
03:18:11,219 --> 03:18:13,978
CHRIS: Good to know! I might catch up with you
later on.

3057
03:18:13,978 --> 03:18:15,025
LAURA: All right!

3058
03:18:15,025 --> 03:18:16,135
CHRIS: Good-bye!

3059
03:18:16,135 --> 03:18:18,177
LAURA: Good-bye!

3060
03:18:18,177 --> 03:18:22,284
MATT: Which she says with a strange doppler effect
even though he's but 20 feet away from you and has

3061
03:18:22,284 --> 03:18:24,795
chosen to ignore the rest of your party to go
about his business.

3062
03:18:24,795 --> 03:18:30,769
CHRIS: It's just like an NPC, just Skyrim.

3063
03:18:30,769 --> 03:18:35,088
MATT: As your skeleton's in the background
dancing.

3064
03:18:35,088 --> 03:18:36,475
CHRIS: There's only one left!

3065
03:18:36,475 --> 03:18:38,124
MATT: Yeah, only one left.

3066
03:18:38,124 --> 03:18:39,582
TALIESIN: He's freezeframe.

3067
03:18:39,582 --> 03:18:43,464
MATT: There's plenty of charred corpses littered
all over this mountaintop you could make undead from.

3068
03:18:43,464 --> 03:18:46,591
TRAVIS: Does the skeleton go with him, or does it
stay?

3069
03:18:46,591 --> 03:18:54,335
MATT: It follows him. All right, so the rest of
you, what is your next course of action?

3070
03:18:54,335 --> 03:19:01,886
LIAM: I sidle up next to my sister and stand there
for a moment and deadpan say, boy, the more things

3071
03:19:01,886 --> 03:19:06,970
change, the more they stay the same. And then I
walk away.

3072
03:19:06,970 --> 03:19:10,501
(laughter)

3073
03:19:10,501 --> 03:19:13,197
TALIESIN: Keyleth, why don't we head home?

3074
03:19:13,197 --> 03:19:14,628
MARISHA: Which home?

3075
03:19:14,628 --> 03:19:15,881
SAM: How do we do that?

3076
03:19:15,881 --> 03:19:16,770
TRAVIS: Whitestone.

3077
03:19:16,770 --> 03:19:19,284
LAURA: Can we get to Whitestone, can you bamf us?

3078
03:19:19,284 --> 03:19:20,638
MARISHA: I can, yeah.

3079
03:19:20,638 --> 03:19:22,160
LAURA: Let's go there and rest up.

3080
03:19:22,160 --> 03:19:23,683
LIAM: Yeah.

3081
03:19:23,683 --> 03:19:28,561
MARISHA: Hey, thank you guys. Thanks for coming,
for helping.

3082
03:19:28,561 --> 03:19:31,111
LAURA: Your dad is very noble.

3083
03:19:31,111 --> 03:19:41,571
SAM: Your homeland is, you know, I mean, the
volcano, the magma, the monsters, the fire torn in

3084
03:19:41,571 --> 03:19:46,745
the sky, it's lovely. It's charming, really.

3085
03:19:46,745 --> 03:19:50,513
MARISHA: Thank you, Scanlan. This isn't my
homeland. I appreciate how well you know me after

3086
03:19:50,513 --> 03:19:51,621
all these years.

3087
03:19:51,621 --> 03:19:53,575
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you lived here.

3088
03:19:53,575 --> 03:19:55,574
MARISHA: No, this is the Fire Ashari's camp.

3089
03:19:55,574 --> 03:19:57,195
SAM: You're not a Fire Ashari?

3090
03:19:57,195 --> 03:19:59,022
MARISHA: I'm an Air Ashari.

3091
03:19:59,022 --> 03:20:01,393
LIAM: It's all right, it's only been a couple of
years.

3092
03:20:01,393 --> 03:20:03,639
SAM: Aren't all Ashari the same?

3093
03:20:03,639 --> 03:20:08,734
MARISHA: You know what, Scanlan, that might be the
most questions you've ever asked me about myself.

3094
03:20:08,734 --> 03:20:11,487
SAM: I don't even know your last name!

3095
03:20:11,487 --> 03:20:15,503
MARISHA: I don't have one.

3096
03:20:15,503 --> 03:20:18,459
SAM: Hey, what's a hashtag?

3097
03:20:18,459 --> 03:20:21,815
LAURA: Hey, Gern! Gern! Gern! Gern!

3098
03:20:21,815 --> 03:20:23,800
CHRIS: Hello?

3099
03:20:23,800 --> 03:20:28,285
LAURA: Is it just dragon scales, or is it any
dragon parts you use?

3100
03:20:28,285 --> 03:20:34,065
CHRIS: You know, mainly dragon scales, but I do
like to see them blown apart, so that part's

3101
03:20:34,065 --> 03:20:35,552
merely for pleasure.

3102
03:20:35,552 --> 03:20:38,192
TRAVIS: You could give him five pounds of dragon
scales.

3103
03:20:38,192 --> 03:20:43,965
MARISHA: I pick a tree that's big enough to
fit all of our fat faces.

3104
03:20:43,965 --> 03:20:47,507
MATT: You already cast Transport via Plants this
day, that's how you got here.

3105
03:20:47,507 --> 03:20:49,753
MARISHA: Maybe we should rest.

3106
03:20:49,753 --> 03:20:52,486
TRAVIS: Do you need me to help you with the tree
spell?

3107
03:20:52,486 --> 03:20:57,393
LAURA: Maybe we should just sleep here and rest up
and spend the night, wake up in the morning, head

3108
03:20:57,393 --> 03:20:58,732
back to Whitestone.

3109
03:20:58,732 --> 03:21:01,511
TALIESIN: He's going to still be there next week,
by the way.

3110
03:21:01,589 --> 03:21:07,257
MATT: And with that, Vox Machina leaves Gern to
his business as they go and camp out at the base

3111
03:21:07,257 --> 03:21:08,952
of the mountain.

3112
03:21:08,952 --> 03:21:12,507
CHRIS: Did someone lose an orb?

3113
03:21:12,507 --> 03:21:14,376
MATT: And with that, we're going to finish
tonight's game!

3114
03:21:14,376 --> 03:21:18,858
(laughter)

3115
03:21:18,858 --> 03:21:21,113
CHRIS: Can I say something from this realm?

3116
03:21:21,113 --> 03:21:22,300
MATT: Yeah.

3117
03:21:22,300 --> 03:21:26,986
CHRIS: I'm delighted. We showed a thing tonight on
@Midnight of someone lounge singing Stand By Me to

3118
03:21:26,986 --> 03:21:32,721
Donald Trump and putting the name Donald in there,
so I told everyone, please tweet that to @Wilw, and

3119
03:21:32,721 --> 03:21:34,973
people are fucking doing it.

3120
03:21:34,973 --> 03:21:36,457
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

3121
03:21:36,457 --> 03:21:41,232
CHRIS: So, if you find the guy singing a very poor
rendition of Stand by Me to Donald Trump, please

3122
03:21:41,232 --> 03:21:45,864
send it to Wil Wheaton, he'll love it! Favorite
thing in the world!

3123
03:21:45,864 --> 03:21:50,349
MATT: You heard it, guys. Critters' call to
action. Make it happen.

3124
03:21:50,349 --> 03:21:52,482
CHRIS: #FeelTheGern.

3125
03:21:52,482 --> 03:21:53,638
LIAM: CritterStrong.

3126
03:21:53,638 --> 03:21:54,893
SAM: Feel the Gern.

3127
03:21:54,893 --> 03:21:58,958
MATT: All right, well, guys. Chris, thank you so
much for coming and hanging out with us.

3128
03:21:58,958 --> 03:22:00,569
CHRIS: Thank you, this was so much fun!

3129
03:22:00,569 --> 03:22:02,466
TALIESIN: A week without crying!

3130
03:22:02,466 --> 03:22:04,417
TRAVIS: Feel the Gern!

3131
03:22:04,417 --> 03:22:08,056
CHRIS: The best DM in the world! This is a
wonderful party, and you're all fantastic. Thank

3132
03:22:08,056 --> 03:22:10,723
you so much. I'm not even upset that you stole my
broom.

3133
03:22:10,723 --> 03:22:18,853
LAURA: Don't judge me, Scanlan, you didn't see me
do it!

3134
03:22:18,853 --> 03:22:20,697
SAM: I didn't! I didn't!

3135
03:22:20,697 --> 03:22:21,991
LAURA: Sam's just judging.

3136
03:22:21,991 --> 03:22:23,878
SAM: I'm judging you, Laura Bailey.

3137
03:22:23,878 --> 03:22:26,236
(laughter)

3138
03:22:26,236 --> 03:22:27,976
MATT: There is a definite distinction.

3139
03:22:27,976 --> 03:22:30,676
LIAM: Don't worry, everyone will judge you when you take
it out and use it for the first time.

3140
03:22:30,676 --> 03:22:33,521
SAM: Vex is fine. Laura Bailey? Awful.

3141
03:22:33,521 --> 03:22:35,847
TRAVIS: She's wanted to fly so much.

3142
03:22:35,847 --> 03:22:37,727
LIAM: Beat him by one.

3143
03:22:37,727 --> 03:22:43,882
MATT: Well, thank you all so very much for
watching tonight. Hope you enjoyed tonight's

3144
03:22:43,882 --> 03:22:48,382
episode. We return next Thursday, 7PM Pacific time
once again to pick up the next length of Vox

3145
03:22:48,382 --> 03:22:54,708
Machina's journey. Everyone, show your love on
Twitter to Chris, @hardwick. Thank you again for

3146
03:22:54,708 --> 03:23:00,463
coming and being an amazing wizard for all of us.
And is it Thursday yet? See some of you guys

3147
03:23:00,463 --> 03:23:02,498
tomorrow, and if not, next week.

3148
03:23:02,498 --> 03:23:03,960
TRAVIS: Peace out!
