00:00:01,487 --> 00:00:03,776
Hello everybody! Are we on the internet?

2
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:04,630
No!

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,735
We're not on the internet, we're live at WonderCon!

4
00:00:07,736 --> 00:00:09,286
We're here at a Critter meetup.

5
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:11,996
We're gonna ask a bunch of Critters
what they know about the show they love.

6
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:13,457
Test their true knowledge.

7
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:14,613
Let's talk to them and find out what's up.

8
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,470
Hi Kayla.

9
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,001
Hi.

10
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,358
Where'd you come from for WonderCon?

11
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:18,674
I came from Oregon.

12
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:20,130
All the way here from Oregon?

13
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,334
Just to come to this fountain?

14
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,031
Mm-hm!

15
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,884
Who is the only member of Vox Machina
to not have died?

16
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:24,730
Keyleth.

17
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,694
Ooh, that's so good.

18
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,406
How many cloaks does Vax have?

19
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:28,520
Um, like 10 billion?

20
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,373
Three.

21
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:31,037
Okay.

22
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:34,200
Name all four members of the Chroma Conclave.
Can you?

23
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,889
Yeah.

24
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,566
Umbrasyl, Raishan, Thordak, and...

25
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,314
Vorugal.

26
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:42,847
For a bonus, name the fifth member.

27
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:44,588
Starts with a B.

28
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,141
Yeah it does.

29
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:47,266
[laughs]

30
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:51,746
Who is the only member of Vox Machina to not have died yet?

31
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,149
Keyle-e-e-e-th!

32
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,435
What kind of feathers did Vex give to her 
half-sister when the party went to Syngorn?

33
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,547
It was owlbear.

34
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:58,765
Oh my god, how do you know this?

35
00:00:58,765 --> 00:00:59,860
Do you want a "Free Denise" pin?

36
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,434
Sure!

37
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:01,438
Okay, there you go.

38
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:02,260
Free her!

39
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,154
Eh, someday.

40
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:07,208
What kind of feathers did Vex give to her half-sister
when the party went to Syngorn?

41
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,493
Those were owlbear feathers.

42
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:09,863
They sure as f**k were!

43
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,936
What later villain did Vox Machina almost encounter

44
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,241
in their first visit to the Fire Plane?

45
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,307
The Cinder King.

46
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:19,844
Correct!

47
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,668
Can you name all four members of the Chroma Conclave?

48
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:26,323
Raishan, Thordak, uh...

49
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:28,046
Uh...

50
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:29,718
I'm blacking out again.

51
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:32,119
He's blacking out.
He's been drinking since 9 a.m.

52
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,019
Yeah, that's what Finnish guys do.

53
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:36,049
I get it.
It's what Irish guys do too.

54
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:36,934
Where is Denise?

55
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:38,305
BRIAN: She's not here.

56
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:41,266
She couldn't make it because of the Witness Protection Program.

57
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:41,947
Okay.

58
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:43,268
Well, you're dressed as Scanlan.

59
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,935
Why is he your least favorite character 
from Critical Role?

60
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,189
Ah, piece of sh*t.

61
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,085
Who possessed Craven Edge before Grog?

62
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,305
Lord Briarwood.

63
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:54,544
Yes, that's correct.
Good god!

64
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:57,127
Percy knows a lot about the show that he's on.

65
00:01:57,127 --> 00:01:58,418
What is Scanlan's mother's name?

66
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,234
I'm a terrible person and I don't know.

67
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:05,171
That doesn't make you a terrible person!

68
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:06,499
It just makes me like the rest of Vox Machina.

69
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:07,885
Absolutely!

70
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:11,208
Pike's mace is particularly effective 
against which type of creature?

71
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:11,926
Undead.

72
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:12,834
Slam dunk.

73
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,460
Would you like a "Free Denise" pin?

74
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,660
Oh my god.

75
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,062
She has one on.

76
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,940
Part of being a great host is observing things
that happen on your show.

77
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,281
I have a question for you, though.

78
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,034
Hit me.

79
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,392
Do you want a "Free Denise" pin?

80
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:27,100
I do not.

81
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,257
Okay. [laughs]

82
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:31,667
A lot of things in this life are free.

83
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,929
Denise is not one of them.

84
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:51,922
