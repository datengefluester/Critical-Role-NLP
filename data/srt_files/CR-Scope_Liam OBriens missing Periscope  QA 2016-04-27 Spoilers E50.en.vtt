NOTE Paragraph

00:00:03.538 --> 00:00:12.793
All right, this looks a little more like what I
remember. Yeah, all right. Hi, everybody. Hmm. So

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:20.312
I only got like 20 minutes, but I know I said I
would do this once in a while, so here we are. I'm

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:28.333
sitting in my office and I came to get some of my
supplies because I have to do some prep for a

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:38.082
gnome druid, a gnome cleric, a gnome rogue, and a
human monk for my seven-year-old daughter's first

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:44.093
game. I don't have a ton of time time to do this,
but I'll probably try to do it like once every

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:49.253
other month, maybe. Anyway, questions. Throw them
at me. "What are your thoughts on the 50th

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:58.282
"episode?" I hope that there are 250 more. I love
doing the show; it's one of the highlights of my

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:08.623
week. I do it with my favorite people. Life and
work get hectic. I think the reason all of us are

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:16.953
drawn to it is it gives us a little time to break
away. What is RWBY? Would I ever consider voicing

00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:23.225
something on RWBY? I don't know what it is! My
kids have seen snippets of the show. I think

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:29.603
we're-- for my taste, it's a little too blue for
them. They're young, but I have

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:34.802
pre-screened parts of it and shown them stuff. I
showed them a little bit of a goblin game the

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:42.912
other day because I thought they'd get a kick out
of that. My dagger collection is quite big. I'll

00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:53.213
show you. It's up here. My nerd shelf. There's
battle cap being ridden by Nightcrawler, but up

00:01:53.213 --> 00:02:00.844
here out of reach of little hands are multiple
daggers. There's the brand-new one from this past

00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:12.872
episode. Yeah, they're all up here. By the way,
Matt Mercer has totally corrupted me and I'll

00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:30.870
show you what I mean by that. Do do do. We're not
done! (sings tune to Isengard theme) Yeah. So I'm

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.300
not quite as addicted as Matt is, but I'm getting
there this year. My kids-- put that back at my

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:47.430
desk. Biggest advice is a tad-- I don't know, man.
I don't know. I don't know if there's an answer to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.271
that. Just try, try your best. Can I come to a con
in Ontario? Well, me coming alone or us coming as

00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:05.451
a group are two different things. I'm probably
more likely these days to go to a convention with

00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:12.332
the group. I don't go to many conventions because
I don't like leaving my family that much and now I

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:18.193
want to go with the CR game. Then the problem with
getting all of us to a convention is you got to

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:23.734
get all of us and we have crazy schedules, so
we'll definitely hit some conventions; not a

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:30.064
million, because the stars have to align, but
we'll get out when we can. I have not considered

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:34.666
recording my kids' games. There's a level of
privacy I'd like to keep for my own life and my

00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:43.455
family. So that'll just be a home deal. Let me
see. "Are you going to Denver Comic Con with the

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:51.966
"crew?" If we have plans, they'll be announced by
the con. What is my favorite mini? Oh gosh. What's

00:03:51.966 --> 00:04:08.294
my favorite mini? Do you even have to ask? Here he
is. Send all your advice to him. Coming back.

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:14.056
Okay. "Podcast soon?" Yeah, podcast soon. Sam and
I talk about it all the time, even though we don't

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:22.176
do it. We do want to do it and now I have gift
certificates to Swordplay LA, so Sam and I'll get

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:29.116
our butts over there and whack each other. I
guess. Let's see. I like being a rogue in the

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:38.478
game. Yes, that's what I gravitated towards most.
I like that Vex jumped into the rogue pool. I

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:46.544
think it's really cool how she ranged for so long,
and then leaned into the rogue, which is where she

00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:56.106
wanted to start, anyway. How much fan art in gigs
do I have from the Critters? I don't know. I mean,

00:04:56.106 --> 00:05:08.085
I could probably figure that out. It's a lot.
Hello, Montana. Hello, Wisconsin. If you asked a

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.733
question and I didn't answer it, chances are I
didn't see it while I was answering another

00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:23.085
questions, so feel free to toss it out again. Good,
more rogues, cdoh_. The podcast. Someone was

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:28.025
asking about the podcast I do with Sam. The
podcast is why Critical Role exists. The podcast

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:33.594
was a show that Sam and I did semi-regularly a
couple years back. We keep it alive every once in

00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:40.705
a while, but where we talked about being
overworked, busy dads with no time to do goofy

00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:49.175
shit, the two of us. Early in that short-lived
run-- it's still going, technically-- but we

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:57.905
pulled people together to do D&D and it just went
from there. Let me see. "How does Vax feel about

00:05:57.905 --> 00:06:06.227
"Vex's new perspective on death?" I don't know, it
just happened. Well, I mean, what Liam thinks is

00:06:06.227 --> 00:06:11.834
different than what Vax thinks for all these
characters. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like

00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:18.895
weeks are going by on these episodes and whether
you guys really realize it or not, I think you

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:24.574
feel like these characters have lived with these
decisions in these events the same amount of time

00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:33.797
that's passed between episode 41 and episode 50,
but we're talking-- Vex died-- I don't know

00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:40.636
exactly-- but it's been within a week. Still
pretty fresh. Who I think will almost die next?

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:49.621
Oh, everybody. I think where Matt's taking us into
dangerous territory now, so I think the stakes are

00:06:49.856 --> 00:06:58.515
raised. "What would your advice be to someone who
wanted to start playing D&D?" Just buy a Player's

00:06:58.515 --> 00:07:07.888
Handbook and try to find people. I've done a
little bit of remote, as you've seen, and I've

00:07:07.888 --> 00:07:12.198
done plenty in-person. Remote is better than
nothing. In-person's better than remote just

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:19.509
because that split second of improvisation-- the
delay can hurt things a little bit or slow it down

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:27.117
a little bit. But again, I would rather play
remotely than not play. "DM advice?" I have no DM

00:07:27.117 --> 00:07:33.926
advice because I am still riding with training
wheels on. I get a lot of requests probably from

00:07:33.926 --> 00:07:39.606
some people in this Periscope right now saying,
"You should you should do a Periscope-- you should

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:46.007
"DM a one shot!" With the amount of pile-on that
Matt gets for occasional decisions and Matt knows

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:54.237
<i>everything</i>. He knows everything and he still
gets piled on for occasional decisions. I am

00:07:54.237 --> 00:07:59.947
fudging it, and winging it, and making it up as I
go. I'm brand new, guys, and I'm doing it was with

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:04.067
a seven-year-old group and a nine-year-old group,
so I don't think I'm quite ready for primetime.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:11.067
Give me a year to cut my teeth, maybe. It's fun.
My kids love it; both of my kids love it. I can't

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:16.505
wait till Romper Stomper-- which is my nickname
for my daughter-- Romper Stomper and her three

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:30.478
friends play on Sunday. I really can't wait. Let's
see. "BlizzCon this year again?" I assume. I don't

00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:39.848
know if I'll officially be there, but I try to go
even when I'm not. "Do Matt Colville's tips help

00:08:39.848 --> 00:08:48.276
you?" Yes, because I've watched Matt Mercer do it
for three years, but I haven't listened to Matt

00:08:48.276 --> 00:08:54.638
Mercer talk about it for three years. Matt
Colville crystallized a lot of things that I think

00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:59.468
that Matt does as well, so it was a good added
perspective and that guy's just sharp as a tack

00:08:59.468 --> 00:09:06.746
and fun to listen to. I met him working on the
game Evolve. He's the writer on that game and I

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:12.528
directed the lion's share of the voiceover on it
and we just became friends even before Critical

00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:18.958
Role and we talked a little bit of D&D. Then
because he knew we were playing around. Good guy.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:25.340
"Is D&D ever stressful?" Yeah, sometimes.
Sometimes it's stressful getting ready for the

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:32.823
game. I can really empathize for Matt just from
preparing my children's games. Then anytime anyone

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:43.092
dies because it's not real, it's a game-- but
let's say Vex or Vax were to die, the faux sibling

00:09:43.092 --> 00:09:51.288
relationship that Laura and I have had for for
this long is an important and meaningful part of

00:09:51.288 --> 00:10:01.121
my life. If one of us dies, we'll reroll another
character and rejoin, but it won't be the same. It

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:05.661
could grow into being something just as good, but
it won't be the same. It's this thing that I've

00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:12.957
had with Laura for three years. It's just like
finishing a really good book: you don't want to

00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:21.971
get to the end, but then you do. It'll happen
eventually. (imitates crying) "Whose death would

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:30.653
"hit me the hardest?" I don't know. "Does the show
ever feel like a job and less like a hobby?"

00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:39.431
Behind the scenes, a little bit because we're
spinning a lot of plates to make it go. But no,

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:47.460
the games feel great. Gosh, I guess I'll mention
this here because enough time has passed. The game

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:59.512
has been like therapy for me for for this entire
time because my mom battled cancer for the past

00:10:59.512 --> 00:11:06.430
couple of years and it got ugly at the end. She
passed away couple months ago, so the funeral was

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:16.849
me. Some of you know that a funeral happened: that
was me. So I don't want to dwell on it because

00:11:16.849 --> 00:11:27.199
it's private and I'm making my peace with it, but
this group of friends for me is just really dear

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:37.109
to me. The game and their company has lifted me
up. So again, I don't want to I don't want to drop

00:11:37.109 --> 00:11:45.180
down into despair. It was hard and occasionally
still is hard, but it's universal, we all go

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:53.379
through it. We'll move on from it. Yeah, it's
okay, thank you, guys. She was-- she was a great

00:11:53.379 --> 00:12:04.500
woman. Do I intentionally try to make people cry?
No, I don't. You do know now, though, a lot of

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:14.940
what was probably feeding me under the surface for
the last year or so. Things got-- I don't know.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:25.795
Let's lighten it up. What other lighter questions
do you have? "Did you check with Matt before

00:12:25.965 --> 00:12:31.114
"letting Vax fall in love with Keyleth?" Yeah, I
talked about this on a Periscope with Matt and

00:12:31.114 --> 00:12:37.245
Marisha, actually, a month or two ago. I
definitely did. Some of you already know, but in

00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:44.364
the Underdark portion show Marisha did something--
I honestly don't remember what it was at this

00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:49.227
point-- but she did something that I thought was
was touching and it just put the idea in my head.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:54.523
I thought, "Oh, is that something you could even?"
Because for the two years at home, I'd never had

00:12:54.523 --> 00:13:00.246
any notion or thought or inkling at all. Just
because of something that happened in one episode,

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:03.494
I'm going, "Oh, I wonder if you could do that the
game. I don't know. Would it be weird with that?

00:13:03.494 --> 00:13:09.815
"This is a game. It's acting, sort of, sort of
isn't. I don't know." So I talked to him about it

00:13:09.815 --> 00:13:16.213
and I said, "If that's something that you don't
want me to do, I do not have to do it, and we'll

00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:22.424
"sweep it under the rug. Forget it." And even when
he was supportive and to this day, like one of the

00:13:22.424 --> 00:13:28.035
most supportive people for Vaxleth with has been
Matt. Behind the scenes, has told me that he loves

00:13:28.035 --> 00:13:34.525
the story that we're carving out together. But I
wasn't sure I wanted to do it because I didn't

00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:42.097
know. There's never been a D&D show quite like
this before. Who does publicly live on the

00:13:42.097 --> 00:13:48.256
Internet the faux relationship with half elves. I
don't know, so I kicked around the idea in the

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:56.255
background and after talking to Matt said maybe
I'll do it and maybe I won't. Just put my toe in,

00:13:56.255 --> 00:14:03.267
put another toe in and then it felt like it's
going to be okay and so on forward. I played

00:14:03.267 --> 00:14:09.375
Juliet once. I pretended to be in love with a dude
who whose breath smelled like ham. It's just

00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:23.735
acting, guys. "What's your-- wait." Oh boy, this
is going fast. It's going fast. "What was it like

00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:28.285
shooting the new Critical Role opening?" Oh my
gosh, it was the best. The hair, though, the long

00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:34.906
wig that they got somewhere and glued to my head
got caught on everything. It got caught in my

00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:38.884
mouth, they got caught on the buttons of my
clothes, it got caught on doors as I walked

00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:45.915
through them. Loved the outfit and loved seeing
everybody come to life, loved watching Sam gyrate.

00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:56.055
I saw Sam do a lot of things you haven't seen yet.
It was the best. "Any advice for voice acting?"

00:14:56.055 --> 00:15:02.430
Yes: study acting, learn how to act, go to where
the work is, hit your head on the wall for ten

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:15.420
years and figure it out and that's the that's the
truest advice there is. "Did you guys keep your

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:22.469
"intro costumes?" Pieces of it. A lot of stuff was
loaners from other people, but I have a lot of

00:15:22.469 --> 00:15:30.591
stuff. Do I enjoy DMing my son's group?
Absolutely! I loved scaring their pants off. I'm

00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:36.988
doing the the starter set. I think I'm going to
start just making it up for my daughter after this

00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:42.440
because it's easy to remember your own stuff. With
the books, I'm flipping around. I'll probably jump

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:51.088
back and forth, but there is a youngish dragon in
that starter set. Yeah, scared the bejesus out of

00:15:51.088 --> 00:15:57.080
them. I knocked one of them down. I'm nerfing
everything. At least for the first year, if not

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.020
for much longer, no one's going to die. The most
they'll ever do is fall unconscious and I will

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:09.191
fudge the dice rolls because I'm not going to make
nine-year-old boys cry. It's supposed to be fun

00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:31.360
for them. Let me see. "What was your favorite fan
gifts for Critmas?" Gosh, okay. I'm not going to

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.271
answer that one, just because I don't want-- a lot
of cool stuff and a lot of touching stuff and a

00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:41.118
lot of handmade stuff. I don't want to say this
and then everyone else go, "Aw!" So I guess I'll

00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:47.611
skip that one. "Are there outtakes for the new
intro?" Probably somewhere, but I don't have

00:16:47.611 --> 00:16:55.099
access to them. "Thoughts on Grog's near-death?" I
don't want Grog to die! I don't want anybody to

00:16:55.309 --> 00:17:06.528
die. I don't want Percy to die, as much as there's
friction between those two. Gosh, I just didn't

00:17:06.528 --> 00:17:26.419
roll high enough with Raven Queen last week, guys.
Let's see. The code for free shipping is-- I can't

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:30.719
remember. "What did Pike learn from her insight
check on Vax?" You'll have to watch to find that

00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:39.241
out or not find out. I don't know if you will. "Is
the bromance growing between Vax and Grog?" I

00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:46.811
think the bromance has already always been there,
but like brothers, sometimes they really lean on

00:17:46.811 --> 00:17:57.101
each other and other times they want to punch each
other. "Do you think Craven Edge will come back to

00:17:57.101 --> 00:18:01.190
"haunt the group?" I don't know. There's a lot of
things that could come back to haunt us. Me,

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:10.990
specifically, there's a rakshasa, there're hags,
bad decisions in general. No, you cannot send me

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:17.630
100 pounds of fudge. Something came in the mail,
guys, with this last round of Critmas and

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:23.263
everything didn't show up in two weeks, it showed
up over months. Somebody sent food and it was

00:18:23.263 --> 00:18:36.211
rotten. It smelled bad. So food, probably not a
good idea. Let me see. "Read anything good

00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:47.471
"lately?" I just finished reading, I didn't finish
it, I've been reading a comic called-- what's it

00:18:47.471 --> 00:18:57.960
called? Harrow Country? It's an Appalachian horror
comic. Must be Harrow Country. "How does Vax feel

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:09.051
"about polyamory?" Guys, come on. I'll stay for
like five more minutes, by the way, because I have

00:19:09.051 --> 00:19:15.890
to draw on maps and I plan some stuff. "Which twin
is older?" I'm the older twin by five minutes. I

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:21.550
snuck out early. Did I see Acquisitions, Inc.? I
didn't watch the most recent. I've been too busy.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.599
I probably will. I don't know how soon, but I
definitely will watch it sometime in the next

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:36.293
month. I haven't read the Uncanny Adventures yet.
"Are we ever going to see Vax and Gilmore getting

00:19:36.293 --> 00:19:47.999
"flirty again?" I don't know. Not at the same
level, probably. Anything specific I want for

00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:53.449
Critmas? No, guys, just keep watching the show and
enjoying it. That's what I want for Critmas. Just

00:19:53.449 --> 00:19:59.539
keep watching the show and enjoying it. "Read the
Hellboy books yet?" Guys, I've read the Hellboy

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:10.141
books many times, but they live down here now in
that same shelf just below my Vectrex. Do any of

00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:15.854
you know what that is? No, 5% of you know what
that is. That was a video game machine in the

00:20:16.074 --> 00:20:23.716
early 80s with line graphics. It was not in color.
The color comes from that. I used to do this all

00:20:23.716 --> 00:20:32.334
the time as a kid. Something to put back in 
there. Careful, there's ninjas. What else do I

00:20:32.334 --> 00:20:41.107
have up here? I have the door to my old Castle
Grayskull when I was a kid. I've got some art that

00:20:41.328 --> 00:20:50.457
you might recognize there. Some books. There's
Simon, and the poison kit, and my Dragonlance

00:20:50.457 --> 00:21:00.118
books from my youth. Those old books are the Lord
of the Rings trilogy, which was the second edition

00:21:00.118 --> 00:21:10.787
given to me by Laura and Travis. Here's Asura from
Asura's Wrath that's made of wood. There's a

00:21:10.787 --> 00:21:18.257
little Vaxleth art back there. That's the tooth of
a prehistoric shark which I've had since I was a

00:21:18.257 --> 00:21:23.807
kid and that's a tie that belonged to my
grandfather who was a bus driver in upstate New

00:21:23.807 --> 00:21:39.227
York. You know who that is. What else? There's
that guy. All my nerdy stuff up here which was

00:21:39.227 --> 00:21:49.627
boxed away in our last place. Hey, Hellboy. Got
that. Those two. Here is the beginning of my

00:21:49.627 --> 00:21:56.266
daughter's group. I need to go to a store tomorrow
and get some. This is my daughter's gnome rogue

00:21:56.266 --> 00:22:03.168
and this will be gnome, I don't know, cleric or
druid nobody's painted yet. Here's our monk.

00:22:03.168 --> 00:22:12.308
That's one game. Those are my daughter's for her
little game. This is for another game for my kids,

00:22:12.308 --> 00:22:17.297
which is just my son and my daughter and he's
playing a dwarven wizard and she's playing an

00:22:17.297 --> 00:22:26.577
elven druid. Then my son's game are these three
guys: my son playing the druid in the middle, and

00:22:26.577 --> 00:22:34.269
then we've got a rogue dragonborn, and a fire
dragonborn. Yes, I am Vax'ildad, it's true. All

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:42.137
right, I'm going to pick three more questions out
of the ether here, and then I got to go do some

00:22:42.137 --> 00:23:05.007
stuff. I'm going to watch for a minute and pick
ones that I like, but it's so fast. I don't know what my

00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:11.578
ring size is. I won't count that for the three.
"Are you a fan of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are

00:23:11.578 --> 00:23:16.680
"Dead?" Yeah, I'm a huge fan of that play and I
think about it all the time when I work in video

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:23.937
games when I do pain and death sounds because one
of the characters-- so it's Rosencrantz and

00:23:23.937 --> 00:23:27.996
Guildenstern. For anyone who doesn't know, it's
the two minor characters from the play Hamlet.

00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:35.486
It's a comedy told from their perspective, so
those two guys are stuck waiting to talk to the

00:23:35.486 --> 00:23:40.177
prince, waiting to talk to the king and thee
queen, and they meet the Player King who was

00:23:40.177 --> 00:23:44.937
an actor, the head of a troupe. That guy goes
on and on saying-- I'm going to paraphrase-- but

00:23:44.937 --> 00:23:48.219
like, "Would you want to see a death? We do all
all kinds of death! We do passionate death, sad

00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:52.857
"death, tragic death, fiery death!" Any time I'm
screaming and pretending get electrocuted and

00:23:52.857 --> 00:24:01.567
pretending to get gutted, I think of that
character in that play. I'm going to wait for the

00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:15.697
next two. What do I think if Kynan returns? I
don't know. I mean, if you'd asked me that 12

00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:22.007
episodes or so ago, I'm a bad opinion, but there's
so much bigger fish to fry. I'm sure Vax hopes

00:24:22.007 --> 00:24:32.096
he's alive. Our game was like a fanciful jaunt up
into the mid 30s, really, and changed a little bit

00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:38.279
but then Mercer went (fire breath) and knocked
everything everywhere. I see a lot of stuff like,

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:46.326
"Oh Liam or Vax, so sad!" and I have no doubt that
like at a certain point, he'll probably get

00:24:46.326 --> 00:24:52.179
his sea legs again, but it's really been like a
week or two since since everything went completely

00:24:52.179 --> 00:24:58.987
upside down and many people he knows were killed
and his sister died in front of him. He made a

00:24:58.987 --> 00:25:05.078
deal, I think he took a gamble and tried to
negotiate with a god and it totally blew up in his

00:25:05.078 --> 00:25:14.006
face. The way I look at Vax is that his life has
been-- as much as his sister and I are tight as

00:25:14.006 --> 00:25:18.977
hell, though life has been kind of crap, what
happened with the dragons was the bottom dropping

00:25:18.977 --> 00:25:23.847
out, and then what happened with Vex and the Raven
Queen was what he thought was the bottom dropping

00:25:23.847 --> 00:25:30.507
another 50 feet, so I don't know, guys. I'm just
doing what makes sense to me from my point of

00:25:30.507 --> 00:26:05.616
view. Last question of the night. Favorite moment
pre-stream. I'll tell you the three moments that

00:26:05.616 --> 00:26:13.437
stand out the most. It's a good cop out. One is
the birth of Burt Reynolds, which was us trying to

00:26:13.437 --> 00:26:22.606
enter a wizard's tower and Sam ridiculously put
his finger in front of his face and talked his way

00:26:22.606 --> 00:26:26.299
through it. It was one of those moments where you
could see in Matt's eyes like, "No, that's not

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:31.228
"going to work, forget it." That's the beauty of
Dungeons & Dragons. Sam rolled a 20 and had to

00:26:31.228 --> 00:26:40.827
roll with it, so that was huge. The Pike death was
a huge moment that none of us will ever forget.

00:26:40.827 --> 00:26:46.929
We're all like-- I was standing up and I felt like
I was vibrating. Again, it's not real, of course

00:26:46.929 --> 00:26:55.128
it's not real, but we had had this relationship
with Ashley and this specific setup between all of

00:26:55.128 --> 00:27:02.549
us, this story. If that character were to have
gone we would have missed that dynamic, so

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:10.618
that was that was huge. Then taking down the blue
dragon who may or may not be part of the Chroma

00:27:10.618 --> 00:27:16.867
Conclave. We don't know either; only one person
knows that. When he put the mini down, it was the

00:27:16.867 --> 00:27:24.707
scariest thing we'd seen on our home table and
there was so much ridiculousness leading up to it

00:27:24.707 --> 00:27:31.698
with Grog nuttily dragging coin to the bag of
holding. Then I got the How Do You Want To Do This

00:27:31.698 --> 00:27:39.257
on it. I parkoured up a wall, went (shink), and
dragged all the way down and he just toppled and

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:44.507
started knocking the whole place down. We had to
flee and leap out of the teleportation circle we used

00:27:44.507 --> 00:27:49.377
to come in. So maybe those three. I bet there's
more that I can't remember if I really thought

00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:56.048
about it. Anyway. This is one of my four or
five-ish Periscopes I'll do for the year. I hope

00:27:56.048 --> 00:28:03.067
you guys had fun. I now I'm going to go design a
cave full of spiders and drow. So peace,

00:28:03.067 --> 00:28:11.397
everybody. Have fun. It's almost Thursday, so I'll
see you soon. Where do they put this thing?
