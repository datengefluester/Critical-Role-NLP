00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:04,008
MATT: Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:08,632
bunch of us nerdy voice actors sit around a table
and play Dungeons & Dragons. If you are returning,

3
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:12,732
welcome back. For those who it's their first time
watching us live on the stream, welcome to the

4
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:18,434
chaos. So, before I begin, a couple of quick
notifications I want to give you guys. We had our

5
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:25,315
first subscriber giveaway hit before the show
started at 4,200. It was LL1973. Turn the mic

6
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:33,681
around. Oh, now you can hear me. Look at this!
The magic of live. Live communication. You have a

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:39,971
wonderful view of this fantastic midsection. It's
delightful. There we go. Is that better?

8
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:40,979
ZAC: Yep.

9
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:47,761
MATT: Velcome. So, welcome to Critical Role, for
those who didn't hear me before. D&D, voice

10
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:53,452
actors, you know the drill now. So our first
giveaway already happened tonight for the

11
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:59,277
subscriber count at 4,200 to LL1973.
Congratulations. You're going to be winning a

12
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:03,001
signed Player's Handbook of Dungeons & Dragons
Fifth Edition, as well as a signed photo of the

13
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:09,392
Critical Role cast. Our next one will be at 4,250,
so, up to every fifty subscribers after that we

14
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:12,134
will be giving away an additional Player's
Handbook and photo signed by the cast.

15
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:13,280
Awesome times.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,334
(cheering)

17
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:16,388
MARISHA: Awesome times?

18
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:17,441
MATT: Indeed, very awesome times.

19
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,733
MARISHA: Good times, good time together.

20
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:23,374
MATT: I think so, indeed. Also, as a heads-up to
you guys, there will be no Critical Role next week

21
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,201
because the San Diego Comic-Con is happening. Down
in San Diego.

22
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,979
MARISHA: We're doing a panel, aren't we?

23
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,156
MATT: I know, we have a panel, though. We have a
panel Thursday, I'll be on the main Geek and

24
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:35,848
Sundry panel with Laura at 1-2 and then we have
our actual full Critical Role panel from 4-5. So

25
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:38,494
if you are going to be there, come see us at PetCo
Park on Thursday.

26
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:39,854
LAURA: You don't need a badge.

27
00:01:39,854 --> 00:01:42,011
MATT: Nope, you can just come and walk on in.

28
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:45,994
MARISHA: Yeah, it is at PetCo Park, so don't get
lost looking around the convention center. Because

29
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:48,857
it won't be there. It's at PetCo Park.

30
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:52,707
MATT: It's the big sports stadium, which to me is
a wonderful irony of us giving a panel about

31
00:01:52,707 --> 00:02:02,348
Dungeons & Dragons in the center of a giant sports
stadium. That's right! Indoor kids. However,

32
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:11,972
however, they are also filming the panel for those
who can't be there. The panel will be on the

33
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:17,781
stream the following day, I believe, so check it
out there, after, with the rest of the Comic-Con

34
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:23,401
stream coverage. It'll be fun. Yeah, so that'll be
good. The week after that, me and Marisha are

35
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:29,161
going to be out of town in New Zealand, so this
means a two-week period without Critical Role

36
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:33,399
main-story stuff, and I apologize, this is all
stuff that got planned before the stream even

37
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:38,856
started. We'll be at a convention in New Zealand.
For those out there planning to come to

38
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:42,147
Armageddon, please come see us, we'll be down
there. It'll be fun for all New Zealand fans.

39
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:48,432
Otherwise, the rest of the Critical Role cast that
are available will be here and will play some

40
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:53,641
other sort of game together and generally interact
with the chat and have a good time until we

41
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,955
return. So.

42
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:56,259
MARISHA: We're working it out.

43
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,290
MATT: Yeah, we're getting the circumstance ironed
out.

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,475
MARISHA AND ORION: Hi, Liam!

45
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,252
MATT: We have Liam on Skype over here.

46
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,290
LIAM: Hi, guys.

47
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,578
MATT: What's up, buddy?

48
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:06,952
LIAM: Hi!

49
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:12,546
MATT: Liam, who's finishing up his vacation as
well. As far as I understand, we have a--

50
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:14,356
MARISHA: How's New Jersey?

51
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:19,136
LIAM: I am deep in upstate New York on the
Canadian border.

52
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:27,331
MATT: Slowly migrating into expatriotism. Don't
go Canadian on us.

53
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:30,102
LIAM: It's frightening to drive here at night. I
can't wait to do it at two in the morning.

54
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:31,106
LAURA: Yay.

55
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:32,138
MATT: Yes.

56
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:33,731
ASHLEY: I'm drinking out of your mug.

57
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:34,622
MATT: She is.

58
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,862
LIAM: My mug? Here's mine.

59
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:39,833
MATT: On river time, there you go.

60
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,571
MARISHA: On river time, what?

61
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,414
MATT: That is-- that's a mug.

62
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:48,485
MARISHA: Did you instantly turn into a 64-year-old
golfer as soon as you went there?

63
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:51,263
LIAM: I'm on a river. I'm on a river.

64
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:53,848
LAURA: I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat.

65
00:03:53,848 --> 00:04:02,552
MATT: So that's going on. Other things we want to
mention. We'll have a special presentation at

66
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:09,543
the break today. We're taking a break from the 826LA
charity for another special charity that has been

67
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:14,705
running for the past week known as GameChanger:
it's a cancer charity and it's been working in

68
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:19,834
conjunction with SquareEnix this past week. To
raise money for cancer research, they've been

69
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:26,923
doing-- if you donate $1 to it they're giving away
codes for the first Deus Ex game for PC and a lot

70
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:30,779
of other fun stuff. We'll have more information
and a presentation for you at the break. So be

71
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,156
aware that's the fun charity we're promoting
tonight, so if anyone has the ability to give,

72
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:41,115
please do, they're an awesome charity. We're also
waiting on Sam Riegel and Taliesin Jaffe, they're

73
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:45,864
both fighting traffic but will be here shortly.
However, let's go ahead and cut to the intro to

74
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:49,579
give us a one-minute break, and then we'll jump
right into this crazy, crazy episode. So see you

75
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:52,371
in just a moment.

76
00:04:52,371 --> 00:05:27,206
[no audio]

77
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,448
Well, while we get that figured out--

78
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:30,723
ORION: Oh, is this a podcast now?

79
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:31,647
MATT: Apparently.

80
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,497
ORION: (old-timey voice) Old time radio.

81
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:34,919
MARISHA: Well, I think the intro--

82
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,137
MATT: Intro video's frozen.

83
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,337
ORION: Damn it.

84
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:46,727
MATT: Also, this is, as opposed to making it a
surprise, this'll be our last game for a little

85
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:48,244
while with--

86
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,423
LAURA: No, don't say it, don't say it yet.

87
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,672
MATT: Don't say it-- okay.

88
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:52,999
TRAVIS: If you say it, it makes it true.

89
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,088
MARISHA: Makes it too real.

90
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,043
MATT: Okay, you're right.

91
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:55,799
ORION: Ooh.

92
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,056
MATT: I'll hold off, all right.

93
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,832
LIAM: Unfortunately, Travis has to leave the
show.

94
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:02,583
MATT: No, that's not true. Grog's ale still needs
to be filled.

95
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,748
TRAVIS: Smash.

96
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:11,010
MATT: Indeed. So we'll patiently wait, folks,
pizza at the ready. Now.

97
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,195
MARISHA: What's going on?

98
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,172
LIAM: Is there a full table behind this computer?

99
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:14,960
LAURA: Pretty much.

100
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,012
MATT: There is, yes.

101
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:17,400
LAURA: Travis is directly behind you.

102
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,041
LIAM: Am I in his chest again?

103
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,505
LAURA: Yeah, you might be even in his face at this
point.

104
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,946
ORION: It's pretty good, though, I like this
better than the iPad.

105
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:27,090
MARISHA: And we can see you more.

106
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,178
LAURA: Can you still see Travis?

107
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,139
MARISHA AND ORION: Yeah.

108
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:29,879
LAURA: Oh.

109
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,882
MATT: It'll be fine.

110
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:31,898
ORION: How can we not see him?

111
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:32,702
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

112
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:33,402
LAURA: That's true.

113
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:34,242
ORION: He's a mountain of man.

114
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:35,152
TRAVIS: I am Rushmore.

115
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:36,231
MARISHA: Travis takes up this side of the frame.

116
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,232
ORION: I'm Rushmore.

117
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:39,892
MATT: If we're having an issue with the intro
video, do you want to just go to the game?

118
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:43,092
TRAVIS: We can do a live intro video.

119
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:47,013
ALL: (intro video music)

120
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:48,893
MATT: Grog! Goliath Barbarian.

121
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:49,942
MARISHA: (crow sound)

122
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,997
(laughter)

123
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,235
MATT: -- and we're done.

124
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:55,890
TRAVIS: I'd been thinking that this had to happen
at some point.

125
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,236
MATT: Yeah.

126
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:58,847
LAURA: Boomf! I was being you, Tiberius.

127
00:06:58,847 --> 00:06:59,739
MARISHA: Yeah.

128
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,120
TRAVIS: We could totally do a Brady Bunch.

129
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,261
MARISHA: Ah ha!

130
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,069
LAURA: Light!

131
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:03,897
MATT: That was pretty good.

132
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:05,582
TRAVIS: You guys are on the bottom of the feed,
right?

133
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:06,559
ORION: Right.

134
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,481
TRAVIS: So if you looked up and we looked down,
we'd essentially be looking at each other.

135
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,441
MARISHA: Oh right, Brady Bunch style!

136
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,411
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, no way.

137
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:11,685
TRAVIS: Oh, hi guys.

138
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:12,811
MARISHA: Hi, Travis.

139
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,041
ORION: Is that how it looks?

140
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,487
TRAVIS: And then everyone looks to the right to
look at Mercer.

141
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:19,212
LAURA: No, yeah, everyone looks to the same--

142
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,702
TRAVIS: Oh, we look right, you look left.

143
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:21,840
TRAVIS AND MATT: No.

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,263
MATT: They look right. Everyone looks right.

145
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:26,339
MARISHA: Everyone looks right? So if we're looking
this way, "Hi, Matt!"

146
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,063
MATT: And I disapprovingly look to my left. There
you go.

147
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,183
ASHLEY: Are we still on?

148
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,090
MARISHA: Yeah.

149
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,329
ASHLEY: Still going?

150
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,329
MATT: Real-time Critical Role.

151
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,282
MARISHA: We're still kind of confused.

152
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:35,233
LAURA: I can't tell what happening.

153
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,092
MATT: So I figure if the intro video's not
working, let's not worry about it. Let's just jump

154
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,227
into the game and get this started. How about
that?

155
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,039
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not.

156
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:40,931
MATT: Cool with that?

157
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:43,034
ASHLEY: Wait, can we show someone that's here
that's really cool?

158
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:43,967
MATT: What's up?

159
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,370
MARISHA: Go ahead and bring him on?

160
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,082
MATT: Oh, well, we're waiting on the break, unless
you want to do it now.

161
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:49,232
ASHLEY: Do it on the break.

162
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:50,218
ORION: So we have video problems?

163
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:51,620
MARISHA: You can come say hi.

164
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,389
ORION: I'm Periscope-ing until we're not having
video issues.

165
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,496
MATT: Well, as far as I know we're on camera.

166
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:02,341
ORION: Oh, we are?

167
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:03,088
CREW: Yeah.

168
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,386
MATT: Yeah, just the intro video's not working.

169
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,406
ORION: Okay.

170
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:09,836
MARISHA: Oh, we probably could have been going for
a while. We've just been like dicking around.

171
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,275
ORION: Bye, guys, we're live.

172
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:14,400
MATT: Ah, welcome to the chaos of live internet.
All right, so let's--

173
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,360
LIAM: I don't think we should go any more meta
than it has to be.

174
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,321
MATT: Let's jump in, guys. Let's jump in. So a
little bit of overview for those of you who are

175
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:26,819
just joining us. At this point in the story, Vox
Machina, this intrepid band of adventurers,

176
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,604
misfits, whatever you must call them, completed an
adventure through the Underdark, a very dangerous,

177
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:33,471
cavernous--

178
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,577
LAURA: Oh, Sam's here.

179
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:35,589
MATT: Oh, we're gonna let Sam in.

180
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:36,613
MARISHA: Sam's here!

181
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,895
ORION: Yeah, he texted.

182
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:42,359
MATT: All right, so after completing this
Underdark challenge, they discovered and managed

183
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:49,291
to extract an evil artifact known as the Horn of
Orcus that held great power and seemingly has a

184
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:55,482
partner somewhere in the world that is unknown.
But the one they have acquired is indestructible,

185
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:59,991
as far as folks know, and it was decided by the
Council of Tal'Dorei and Vox Machina that it

186
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:06,758
should be sealed away and hopefully forgotten for
the rest of eternity. The best place to do so came

187
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:11,449
up in the conversation to be the city of
Vasselheim, which is on a different continent far

188
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:15,192
to the northwest of Tal'Dorei, the kingdom where
most of the story as to this point has taken

189
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:23,666
place, to be sealed in what is referred to as the
Platinum Sanctuary, the oldest existing temple to

190
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:30,585
Bahamut, the good platinum dragon deity. So they
were given passage on a skyship to cross the Ozmit

191
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:36,357
Sea to Othanzia, the continent that houses the
capital city, Vasselheim. So the group gathered

192
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:43,539
together, rode on to the magically elevated
skyship, and are traversing the ocean carrying the

193
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:47,403
Horn of Orcus within this holy container. Hello!

194
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:48,774
MARISHA: Hi, Sam.

195
00:09:48,774 --> 00:09:49,815
MATT: Sam has joined us.

196
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:50,914
SAM: Hi!

197
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:57,744
MATT: They found themselves over the ocean,
suddenly attacked by a band of what seemed to be wyvern-

198
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:03,167
and griffin-riding bandits. The battle took place
on the top of the skyship, some of the magic being

199
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:09,258
taken out, a few lives lost, but the party managed
to persevere, take a captive, and continue on

200
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,105
their journey, the Horn of Orcus and its container
kept safe. And that's where we pick up and begin.

201
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,929
SAM: Can you say all of that again for me?

202
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:19,377
(laughter)

203
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:20,868
TRAVIS: You don't listen, anyway.

204
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:22,125
MATT: No.

205
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,938
MARISHA: (laughs) You don't listen, anyway.

206
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:32,336
MATT: All righty, so as you guys have settled in,
the Horn safe, you've taken a couple more days on

207
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:39,299
this journey, what was told to be about a six-day
journey across the ocean, six to seven days. Is

208
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,443
there anything you guys wish to accomplish at this
moment?

209
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:42,632
SAM: Are we in the air?

210
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:43,837
MATT: You are still in the air on the skyship.

211
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:44,863
SAM: Not much we can do.

212
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,657
MARISHA: Well, we just-- so we fought off the
wyverns.

213
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,409
SAM: Oh, do we have one? We have one.

214
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:52,265
TRAVIS: Is the little magician halfling still
being polite and brushing her teeth and stuff?

215
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,070
LAURA: Oh, that's right, our little halfling that
we--

216
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,026
TRAVIS: Who you saved. Wuss.

217
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:57,921
MATT: Yes.

218
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,105
SAM: She's a mage, right?

219
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:03,782
MATT: That you saved. She is a mage, and she has
also been bound, at the orders of the captain, so

220
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:07,371
as not to cause any issues on the ship while she's
there. So as to her future, after your

221
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:12,422
conversation with him, as to whether or not she
could work on this ship, based on the fact that

222
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,104
their first meeting involved her and her band
attacking and trying to murder his entire crew,

223
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:23,490
Captain Damon was not too keen on the idea at the
time being and decided to lock her up.

224
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,558
LAURA: Oh.

225
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,299
MATT: So. We shall see her fate in the near
future.

226
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,273
TRAVIS: She's locked up.

227
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:28,260
LAURA: Okay. She's locked up.

228
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,464
TRAVIS: She's got tricks, though, right?

229
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:33,151
MATT: She has tricks, but there is an anti-magic
brig built into the ship specifically

230
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,128
for this purpose.

231
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,293
SAM: Ooh. Fancy.

232
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:36,993
TRAVIS: That's all I needed to know.

233
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,860
LAURA: Oh, that's good to know. I was going to pay
you to put the kibosh on her.

234
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:41,239
ORION: She's negged.

235
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,312
TRAVIS: Cool.

236
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:47,271
MATT: (laughs) So. I'll say that Percy is
continuing to read his book. The next few days

237
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,073
pass without incident. Is there anything you want
to accomplish? Anything?

238
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:52,925
ORION: You said the next few days without
incident? Cool.

239
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:54,540
TRAVIS: Could I try to further my beard?

240
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,696
SAM: Oh, yes! Try to grow a beard.

241
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:56,890
MARISHA: Yeah, his beard. Let's go for the beard.

242
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,086
MATT: Go ahead and roll another percentage dice.

243
00:11:58,086 --> 00:11:59,442
TRAVIS: Yeah! It's a d20, right?

244
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,479
LAURA: It's a percentage die.

245
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,222
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, that's right. The two in
a row. I remember.

246
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,070
MATT: Two d10s.

247
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,569
TRAVIS: I'm learning. I'm learning.

248
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:05,525
MARISHA: Yep.

249
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,733
MATT: First one and the second one.

250
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:07,877
TRAVIS: Three. Eight.

251
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:12,865
MATT: 38. The little bit of peach-fuzz stubble on
the chin of your goliath face begins to slowly

252
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:18,134
grow. It's coming out colorless. It's almost
translucent with a hint of gray and white.

253
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:19,342
SAM and LAURA: Ew.

254
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,028
TRAVIS: I'm a Targaryen, baby.

255
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:22,177
(laughter)

256
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:23,320
LIAM: That's hot.

257
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,732
LAURA: It's translucent, like--

258
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:29,552
MATT: A color is there. It's almost like fishing
line is growing out of the bottom of his chin.

259
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:30,417
TRAVIS: Yeah.

260
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,278
SAM: Ugh.

261
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:32,092
ASHLEY: Whoa.

262
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,068
TRAVIS: Don't be jealous.

263
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,735
ASHLEY: Grog, it's sparkling. It's sparkling!

264
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:35,884
LAURA: It's really creepy, Grog.

265
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,452
ASHLEY: Hey, I feel it. It's like sandpaper, a
little bit.

266
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:38,610
TRAVIS: Thank you. Thank you.

267
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,773
MATT: Keep in mind, goliaths, predominantly--
especially pureblood goliaths-- do not grow facial

268
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:48,420
hair. The fact that this magical feat is even
achieving any modicum of growth is in itself an

269
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,038
arcane marvel, and who knows what detrimental
effects this may have in the long run, going

270
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,856
against your physiology.

271
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:59,643
TRAVIS: Oh, crap. It's all right. It'll make me
look really wise, you guys. Nobody will know.

272
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:03,861
MARISHA: I have some beads. If you want, we can
braid it and put beads in there.

273
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:04,861
LAURA: Ooh.

274
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,798
TRAVIS: I'm all about it. Beads and bells and
shit?

275
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:07,715
MARISHA: Okay!

276
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:08,946
MARISHA: I braid Grog's beard.

277
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,347
TRAVIS: Give me a staff and I'll be Gandalf.

278
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,310
MATT: All right.

279
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,416
MARISHA: And put beads in it. And a few flowers,
as well.

280
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,606
TRAVIS: Wait! Ooh, weird.

281
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,174
MARISHA: It looks nice.

282
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:17,392
TRAVIS: All right.

283
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:23,235
MATT: It takes you a lot of concentration to try
and get any sort of braidage through the about an

284
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,679
inch to inch and a half facial hair that is
growing from his chin.

285
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,808
MARISHA: Looks good!

286
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,329
TRAVIS: It's really tight when you braid it like
that. It pinches.

287
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,459
MARISHA: You'll get used to it.

288
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,022
LAURA: Maybe you can cast Grasping Vine on his
chin and grow it out.

289
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,769
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

290
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:36,049
(laughter)

291
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,631
TRAVIS: Do it. Could be great.

292
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,237
ORION: I suggest against this.

293
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,635
TRAVIS: I thought you suggest violence.

294
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:42,807
ORION: No.

295
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:44,083
SAM: He encourages violence.

296
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,341
LAURA: I encourage violence.

297
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,509
ORION: I'm against this.

298
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:47,607
ASHLEY: Is it just violence?

299
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,790
LAURA: So we're healed. We're healed, right?

300
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,717
SAM: Oh, days have gone by, right?

301
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:51,676
MATT: Yeah, you guys have rested. Days have gone
by, your spells have returned to you--

302
00:13:51,676 --> 00:13:53,839
LIAM: Hey, DM, days have gone by?

303
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,207
LAURA: Trinket's feeling good.

304
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,436
MATT: Days have gone by at this time. You've
continued traveling over the Ozmit Sea.

305
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,331
ORION: Are we nearing the destination?

306
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,877
MATT: I'll get to that in just a second. Do you
have a question, Liam?

307
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:09,525
LIAM: No, not a question, but last night while
Grog was sleeping-- I can see right up Grog's

308
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:17,669
nose. While Grog was sleeping, I went and got a
bit of rope from the ship and used my disguise kit

309
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:24,919
that I have. I sort of frayed a part of the rope
and spent about an hour using spirit gum to glue

310
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:35,837
bits of frayed rope to Grog's chin into a small
Gilmore-esque goatee. And he didn't seem to wake

311
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:39,083
up, and I'd like to see how that worked out.

312
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,873
MATT: (laughs) All righty.

313
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:49,222
TRAVIS: I'm gonna do a sleep check or something,
right? I can't let him survive that.

314
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,576
MATT: For this, go ahead and make a perception
check with disadvantage.

315
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:53,940
TRAVIS: With disadvantage?!

316
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,847
SAM: Because you're asleep!

317
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:56,791
TRAVIS: One.

318
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,848
(laughter)

319
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,077
ORION: Get it out now.

320
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:04,478
MATT: You wake up the following morning and
immediately run to the nearest reflective surface

321
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:11,314
to check on yourself, and you have a glorious,
dark brown, well-braided, mildly frayed, thick,

322
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:14,771
coarse goatee braid. It goes about a good three to
four inches from the bottom of your chin. And you

323
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:15,928
are very proud.

324
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:19,410
TRAVIS: I knew it! I knew it! I am a special boy.
(laughs)

325
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,314
(laughter)

326
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:27,249
TRAVIS: Only this one strand is this color and
everything else is white and translucent,

327
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,544
whatever--

328
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:29,701
ORION: I think it looks good on you, Grog.

329
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:30,683
TRAVIS: Thank you!

330
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:32,514
I wave my head and it whips around.

331
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,889
ASHLEY: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.

332
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,412
TRAVIS: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.

333
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:45,446
MATT: It stays taut on your chin. All right, so as
you reach the middle of the sixth day of travel,

334
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:51,209
the sky, which up to this point had been fairly
sunny and clear, begins to slowly cloud over. The

335
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:57,726
weather grows more gray, and the clouds themselves
seem to cluster more into-- I wouldn't say a

336
00:15:57,726 --> 00:16:01,552
stormfront, but definitely a more gloomy
atmosphere.

337
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:05,859
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if this
seems to be natural or arcane?

338
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,133
MATT: Certainly.

339
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,728
ORION: Nice.

340
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:13,208
LAURA: (sings) With her big fancy die!

341
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,162
MARISHA: Okay, that's a 10 plus-- 20, total.

342
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:19,322
MATT: All right. Looking at these clouds, it is a
slow formation, and they aren't moving at an

343
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:25,000
unnecessary speed or seem to have any ominous
press towards you. It just seems like the weather

344
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,735
itself towards this northern continent seems to be
of a colder variety.

345
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:36,355
ORION: I'm going to sense the weather, I suppose,
because this doesn't look fun.

346
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:38,662
MATT: Okay. The weather is cold.

347
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:40,684
ORION: Ooh, it's cold.

348
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:42,527
TRAVIS: So the weather outside is frightful?

349
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,042
LAURA: Good call, Tiberius. Good call. I agree, it
is rather cold.

350
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,122
ORION: I don't like this. Scanlan.

351
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,360
SAM: Oi?

352
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:56,137
ORION: Like we were discussing earlier, would you
be interested in the still-standing trade of my

353
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:59,319
Ioun Stone for your circlet-crown thingy?

354
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:05,029
SAM: Oh, you know what, Tiberius, I have been
giving this a lot of thought and consideration.

355
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,656
What's for lunch?

356
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:10,953
ORION: What would you like for lunch? I already
ate.

357
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,262
SAM: Oh. No. No, I was done with the
conversation.

358
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:14,355
TRAVIS: Oh, good diss.

359
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:15,894
LAURA AND ASHLEY: Oh.

360
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:21,960
ORION: Well. Keyleth, if you could put a little
slate up for me, I'd like to illustrate something

361
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,799
for little Scanlan. And perhaps his tiny mind can
comprehend it. (clears throat)

362
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,080
LAURA: Ooh!

363
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,521
ASHLEY: Hey, that's rude.

364
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:32,028
ORION: Would you, perhaps, do this?

365
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:36,267
LAURA: His tiny mind is exactly proportionate for
the rest of his body, Tiberius.

366
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,506
SAM: Well, not the entire body.

367
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:41,406
ORION: I'm going to walk up to the hull and be
like--

368
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:44,776
MARISHA: No! Write it right here! I throw up a
slate.

369
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:45,887
ORION: Oh. (clears throat)

370
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:50,345
MATT: Okay. It's the strangest wall you've
constructed, as up in the air on the ship that is

371
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:54,517
mostly constructed out of iron and metal, there is
little to no stone available of which you can

372
00:17:54,517 --> 00:18:00,091
sprout a Wall of Stone. However, there are weights
set up on top, so what you create is less of a

373
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:08,133
smooth Wall of Stone and more of a very thin,
brittle shale wall that may function for the time

374
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,897
being, but probably won't stand up for more than
five to ten minutes.

375
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:13,453
ORION: I see. Prestidigitation. Some chalk.

376
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:15,427
MATT: All right.

377
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:21,534
ORION: You see, Scanlan, you've had this
particular piece for over ten, let's say, matches

378
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:34,169
or weeks. You have used it zero times. In over six
battles, over the same course,

379
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:36,586
using it zero times.

380
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,031
(laughter)

381
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:42,186
ORION: I, being a sorcerer, have a special ability
called sorcerer points, where I can do multiple

382
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,104
spells in a single round.

383
00:18:44,104 --> 00:18:45,174
SAM: Yes.

384
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,500
ORION: Which none of you can do. Other than monks,
of course.

385
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,845
LAURA: That's true. Brag about it, Tiberius. Just
keep bragging about it.

386
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:58,494
ORION: When I can do multiple spells, like two,
versus you, who can do one, that means that I can

387
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,775
do one more spell than you can per round.

388
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:01,997
(laughter)

389
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:02,972
SAM: All right.

390
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,855
ORION: And every round after that. One hundred
percent.

391
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,200
(laughter)

392
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,964
SAM: This is amazing.

393
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:18,071
ORION: Your utilization of the actual item has
been equivalent to nothing. In the interest of the

394
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:24,863
group and the use of items in general, it would be
wise to switch it, because you have needed extra

395
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,366
spells like Invisibility--

396
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,827
MATT: The shale wall cracks.

397
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:30,281
(laughter)

398
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,944
ORION: Several times.

399
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:33,283
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

400
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:35,872
ORION: Where my item would be more useful in
general to you.

401
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:41,463
LIAM: May I ask, is magical ability inversely
proportionate to wisdom?

402
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,515
ORION: Oh, me?

403
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,957
SAM: Who are you asking?

404
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:47,314
ASHLEY: Is magical ability inversely proportionate
to wisdom?

405
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:52,354
ORION: Absolutely not. I am one of the strongest
casters in all of Draconia, and it only takes the

406
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:54,999
strength of my charisma to do my stuff.

407
00:19:54,999 --> 00:20:00,569
LAURA: Oh. Everything makes sense now, Tiberius.

408
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:04,755
TRAVIS: So are you saying you want what he has
back?

409
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:08,413
SAM: (laughs) I didn't recognize you, Grog. Is
that you?

410
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,856
TRAVIS: It is I, Brad Pitt from Legends of the
Fall.

411
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,817
(laughter)

412
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:14,339
TRAVIS: My beard of glory.

413
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,536
ORION: That is a movie.

414
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:18,890
TRAVIS: It's an old bard's tale.

415
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,247
ORION: So, Scanlan. What say you?

416
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:27,351
SAM: Your mathematical skills have been quite
impressive.

417
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,073
ORION: I don't like to show them off.

418
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:36,487
SAM: No, no. For a man of such low wisdom, you are
proving wiser than I ever imagined.

419
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,453
(laughter)

420
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:44,748
SAM: I will gladly make this trade with you. You
have convinced me.

421
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:45,585
LAURA: Hey.

422
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:46,381
MARISHA: Aww.

423
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,510
ORION: Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

424
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,580
SAM: Yes. Yes.

425
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,288
ASHLEY: Hey.

426
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,109
LAURA: That's wonderful.

427
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,175
SAM: All right. Hugs, hugs, hugs.

428
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,275
(laughter)

429
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,787
ORION: (explosion sound)

430
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,580
SAM: Now, what does this thing do?

431
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,957
ORION: Now you can store up to three level spells.
Three of them in there.

432
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:01,482
LAURA: Oh, it's better than the Pearl of Power!

433
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:04,284
ORION: And you don't have to expend spell slots to
do the spells.

434
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:05,897
SAM: All right. Thank you very much.

435
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:06,894
ASHLEY: Hey.

436
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:07,891
LAURA: That's a good trade.

437
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,978
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that was so good.

438
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,176
ASHLEY: That was amazing.

439
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,562
ORION: You can put three Lightning Bolts in there
and it costs nothing.

440
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,853
ASHLEY: Oh, math!

441
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:15,795
SAM: All right, all right. I'm man enough to admit
that he's convinced me.

442
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,956
TRAVIS: That was so good.

443
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:19,231
ASHLEY: That was awesome.

444
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:21,964
TRAVIS: I don't know what you wrote, but it looked
good.

445
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,251
MARISHA: Oh, man.

446
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,573
ORION: I'm sorry.

447
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:28,290
MATT: The Ioun Stone which you had taken, you
place by your head and release. It seems to fix

448
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,762
itself in the air and slowly rotate above your
head.

449
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:31,823
ORION: It orbits.

450
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,819
MATT: Almost held in its own orbital gravity
around your head.

451
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:34,568
LAURA: Ooh.

452
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:35,736
SAM: Pike.

453
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:38,873
ASHLEY: Oh. (laughs) Oh, wow. It's like you have a
halo.

454
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:39,882
ORION: It is fancy.

455
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:45,788
SAM: It's like a halo. Like your god has smiled on
me, maybe, and said, "He's cool. Go for it."

456
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:49,228
ASHLEY: Oh, wow. Well, I don't know if that's what
it means.

457
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:54,790
SAM: Well. You know, religion is up to
interpretation, so I interpret it that way.

458
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,533
ASHLEY: It is very cool-looking.

459
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,402
SAM: Thank you, Pike.

460
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:02,907
TRAVIS: (laughs) So casual, her god. "It's cool.
Go for it."

461
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:08,651
MATT: (laughs) Sarenrae. The she-bro you never
had.

462
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:10,074
(laughter)

463
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,763
SAM: Sarenrae's my wingman.

464
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,050
ASHLEY: We cool, Sarenrae.

465
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,248
TRAVIS: I can't breathe.

466
00:22:15,248 --> 00:22:21,576
MATT: Many a cart hold that bumper sticker. All
right, so as this conversation comes to a close,

467
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:27,149
the temperature in the sky has gotten noticeably
chillier. And you swear for an instant you start

468
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:32,106
seeing what looks like specks of white snow
beginning to drift from the clouds ahead.

469
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:33,918
MARISHA: (gasps) It's snowing.

470
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,113
LAURA: It's snow, Keyleth.

471
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:38,721
SAM: (sings) I'm dreaming of a white
whatever-we-celebrate.

472
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:40,436
TRAVIS: Festivus!

473
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:41,678
ORION: Festivus.

474
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:50,924
MARISHA: There was something I should probably
tell you. In this area of land, in Vasselheim, on

475
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:59,203
this continent, somewhere, I'm not sure where,
resides the Fire Ashari. Somewhere in

476
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:00,484
the town of Pyrah.

477
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:01,463
LAURA: What's that?

478
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,309
ASHLEY: Ooh.

479
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,488
LAURA: What are Fire Ashari?

480
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:07,386
MARISHA: Well, they're my sister tribe. They're a
part of my sister tribe. I come

481
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,563
from the Air Ashari.

482
00:23:08,563 --> 00:23:09,294
LAURA: Right.

483
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:10,154
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

484
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,254
MARISHA: Yeah, from Zephra.

485
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:12,305
ASHLEY: (whispers) Fire Ashari?

486
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:13,256
LAURA: So they-- oh.

487
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:15,942
MARISHA: Yeah, so there are Fire Ashari. So the
point behind the Ashari-- I'm not sure I have

488
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:25,052
expressed this to you all in the past few months.
The point of our tribe is we sought out the

489
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:32,053
weakest points where the elemental planes start to
bleed with our plane of existence, and these

490
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:37,959
planes need to be protected, so our people have
sought them all out in order to make haven there

491
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:43,809
and be the protectors that we were all born to be.
And as part of my Aramente, I have to seek out

492
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,536
each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy
leader.

493
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:49,591
TRAVIS: Ooh.

494
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,357
MARISHA: Which makes me really nervous.

495
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:54,675
LAURA: We've got your back, Keyleth.

496
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:56,076
ASHLEY: Oh, you'll do it. You'll totally do it.

497
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:57,788
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, we can burn shit for days.

498
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:04,464
MARISHA: So I just thought, you know, maybe after
we handle the Horn, maybe we can pop in. You know,

499
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,577
since we're here.

500
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,997
LAURA: Totally. You know, if you want to, Keyleth,
when we go, we'll all follow your orders and make

501
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:11,072
it seem like you're an extraordinary leader of
us.

502
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,206
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah.

503
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,438
MARISHA: Oh. That could be good. Oh, that sounds
fun!

504
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:17,660
ORION: Oh. Good idea, yes. Of course, I will be
your mage guard.

505
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,922
TRAVIS: Do they make you burn things as a display
of your abilities?

506
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:21,592
MARISHA: Well, they kind of teach me new things.

507
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:22,523
LAURA: Ooh!

508
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:24,218
MARISHA: They kind of instill me with their
knowledge.

509
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:26,395
LAURA: So the tornado thing. You could be like a
fire tornado?

510
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:28,256
MARISHA: I could. I know!

511
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:29,203
TRAVIS: Shut up!

512
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:36,171
MARISHA: I'm so excited! But yes. Super nervous,
because social skills aren't my strongest suit.

513
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,168
LAURA: We've noticed.

514
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:38,545
TRAVIS: You're a natural. You're great.

515
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:39,689
LAURA: You're great, though.

516
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:40,835
MARISHA: Oh, you guys.

517
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:41,951
ASHLEY: But it's very charming.

518
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:44,015
TRAVIS: We gotta go there. It's fire everywhere!

519
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,485
ORION: (laughs) Oh.

520
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,650
MARISHA: Yes. Yes.

521
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,296
LIAM: Is everything copacetic between the
different tribes?

522
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:50,486
TRAVIS: Oh, good question.

523
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:51,757
MARISHA: What? What?

524
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:52,660
TRAVIS: Is it copacetic?

525
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,712
LAURA: Are you guys friendly with each other?

526
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:54,604
LIAM: Are they happy?

527
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:55,461
ORION: The tribes.

528
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,717
MARISHA: Well, yes. Yeah, no, we're all happy. I
mean, that's kind of the thing, where once a

529
00:24:58,717 --> 00:25:03,810
generation someone sets out and goes on the
Aramente in order to come back a headmaster, and

530
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:10,351
it's kind of like our once-a-generation check-in,
if you will, to make sure everything's okay.

531
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:12,920
TRAVIS: Exchange students.

532
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,632
MARISHA: Unfortunately, the last person to go on
the Aramente didn't come back, which happens

533
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:18,862
sometimes. Yeah.

534
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:23,299
TRAVIS: Like, didn't come back ever?

535
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:24,629
MARISHA: No.

536
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:26,294
LAURA: So, like, you could die?

537
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,820
ORION: Or maybe they got lost to the winds of the
road.

538
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,998
TRAVIS: Right, yeah.

539
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:32,104
MARISHA: It was actually my mother.

540
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:33,777
ORION: Oh, goodness.

541
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:34,764
LAURA: (gasps) What?

542
00:25:34,764 --> 00:25:36,028
TRAVIS: To which tribe?

543
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:43,203
MARISHA: I-- we don't know. She left when I was a
little girl, so I don't remember much. So I don't

544
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:45,864
know if she's alive or dead, really, but--

545
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,055
LAURA: Keyleth.

546
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,837
TRAVIS: We did not know that.

547
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,055
MARISHA: It's okay. It's okay.

548
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:52,295
TRAVIS: Yeah, no bigs, right?

549
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:53,139
LAURA: Yeah.

550
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:54,309
TRAVIS: Just your mother.

551
00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:00,065
MARISHA: I mean, it's-- I mean. Well. It's fine.
It's just. It's weird. I haven't seen her, so I

552
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:00,957
don't know.

553
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:01,959
SAM: Awkward.

554
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,066
MARISHA: I barely remember her.

555
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:06,054
TRAVIS: Do you think there's a chance of when we
visit this place, we might have to defend

556
00:26:06,054 --> 00:26:07,214
ourselves?

557
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:09,240
MARISHA: No. No. I wouldn't think so.

558
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,817
ORION: Which means "of course."

559
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,860
LAURA: It's not like your family, Grog. They're
actually nice.

560
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,202
MARISHA: Yeah, we're pretty-- we're cool.

561
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:18,833
TRAVIS: Look, my family is nice, too. We just
share love with fists.

562
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,978
ORION: Understandable.

563
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:23,184
LAURA: That sounds wrong in so many ways.

564
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:24,656
TRAVIS: It does, actually.

565
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:30,927
LIAM: Keyleth, did your mother have to go alone,
or does your tribe permit there to

566
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:34,121
be help for you?

567
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:37,417
MARISHA: I'm assuming it would be okay. We're
pretty welcoming.

568
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,621
LAURA: That's good.

569
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:39,859
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should totally be there.

570
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:41,402
LAURA: All right. We will go.

571
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:42,009
MARISHA: Yeah.

572
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,283
TRAVIS: And maybe ask them if they've seen your
mom.

573
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:44,344
MARISHA: Yeah. That'd be interesting.

574
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:45,193
LAURA: Yeah.

575
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:49,154
MARISHA: It's weird. There's this part of me in
the back of my head that kind of always wonders if

576
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:51,139
I'm going to run into her.

577
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:54,760
TRAVIS: How old-- when was the last time you saw
your mother, or do you even remember?

578
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,808
MARISHA: I was five, six maybe, years old when she
left.

579
00:26:58,808 --> 00:26:59,959
TRAVIS: Wow.

580
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,326
MARISHA: So I'm the next in line.

581
00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:04,033
LAURA: (whispers) Wow.

582
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:05,274
SAM: This is heavy.

583
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:06,177
TRAVIS: Yeah.

584
00:27:06,177 --> 00:27:07,284
ASHLEY: This is very heavy.

585
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,289
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring the
mood down.

586
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:09,595
SAM: No, it's fine. It's good to know this.

587
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,768
MARISHA: I'm just letting you know that we're
going to be in that neck of the woods,

588
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:13,048
so I should probably--

589
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:13,783
LAURA: Stop by.

590
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:14,542
ASHLEY: Yes.

591
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,502
MARISHA: -- you know, go.

592
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:16,175
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

593
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:17,167
LAURA: Give a little hello.

594
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:19,804
MATT: "Land sighted!" A voice breaks out from 
the side of the ship's bow.

595
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:20,615
ORION: Ooh.

596
00:27:20,615 --> 00:27:25,829
MATT: You guys glance over quickly to the edge of
the skyship, and you see, right over the edge of

597
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:33,868
Deera, what looks to be this ominous continent
slowly approaching. Through the mists, the low

598
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:38,165
clouds of this area, you can make out what looks
to be a fairly heavily wooded and overgrown

599
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:44,037
landscape. You can see dark forest peppered with a
little bit of snowfall across the top.

600
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,489
LAURA: My kind of place.

601
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:49,089
MATT: Occasional mountaintops and peaks breaking
through the canopy of the distant forest.

602
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:51,169
LAURA: Look, Trinket! Home.

603
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:59,415
MATT: Trinket looms up to the side and looks a bit
chilly and shakes it off. At which point, Kima

604
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:04,788
comes up and joins the rest of you. Puts her
elbows over and looks off wistfully for a second

605
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:13,541
and goes, (sighs) "It's been some time. Welcome to
Othanzia, folks. It's an interesting place."

606
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,675
TRAVIS: It is, isn't it?

607
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:16,052
LAURA: We'll follow your lead.

608
00:28:16,052 --> 00:28:23,713
MATT: She points off, says, "This forest here we
refer to as the Vesper Timberland, and it goes for

609
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:30,984
"miles and miles and miles before bleeding into
endless tundra to the north, so let's hopefully

610
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:39,345
"not travel that far." (sighs) "This'll be
interesting." And she turns around and heads back

611
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:41,778
down into the ship. As you continue--

612
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:42,730
LAURA: Good talk!

613
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,576
MARISHA: Why did she say that? (laughs) I know!

614
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:45,928
ORION: Who was that person?

615
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:47,887
MARISHA: That was so weird, right?

616
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:52,502
ORION: Everywhere we go. It's everywhere we go.
Why can't people be normal?

617
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:54,926
TRAVIS: She's warming up to me, I can feel it.

618
00:28:54,926 --> 00:29:02,680
MATT: As the ship slowly begins to descend, you
can see, in the distance, from one of the various

619
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,487
mountain ranges that break past the top, there is
one singular mountain spire that tends to protrude

620
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:14,284
from the center of the forest, about 20 to 30
miles off the shoreline of the Ozmit Sea. Around

621
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:20,052
the base of this mountain, you can see, the closer
you get to it, what looks like hundreds upon

622
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:25,735
hundreds of stone buildings. You can see little
details along the mountainside. Countless

623
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:31,621
staircases are spiraling up this mountain in
different directions in a chaotic fashion. There

624
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:36,845
are large structures, fortresses, built into the
side of this mountain spire as you progress up the

625
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:46,841
top. And this city proper, which spreads out, I'd
say, about a third larger than Emon. Layers of

626
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:51,463
walls and walls and walls. This is
probably the most-fortified city you've seen in

627
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:57,946
your existence up to this point. Slowly it begins
to bring itself down towards-- and you can see, as

628
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:06,310
you get closer to the city, the walls vary in
color and material. Some look recently built. Some

629
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:12,445
look like they'd been constructed in the past 50
to 60 years or so from fine, smooth stone, using

630
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:18,594
modern architectural techniques. Some walls look
extremely ancient, partially crumbled and having

631
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:28,731
to be refortified. You also notice the top of
these walls are completely covered with what looks

632
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:35,020
like these strange dragon-headed ballistae. These
defense ballistae that are along every single row

633
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,065
of walls. This is a city that is meant to
withstand--

634
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:40,433
MARISHA: A siege.

635
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:42,133
MATT: -- any sort of a siege or onslaught.

636
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,824
LAURA: Does it look like it's suffered a lot of
sieges? I mean, is there battle damage to the--

637
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:49,745
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance. You're
just starting to pick up details as the ship

638
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:54,241
slowly descends into the city of Vasselheim
proper. But from what you can tell, there are

639
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:59,831
scars across some of the larger buildings. Some of
the walls look like they have sections that have

640
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:04,742
been knocked down and then rebuilt and then
knocked down and then rebuilt. This is a very,

641
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:14,205
very old, old city. Slowly, the ship descends
towards what looks like a smoothed-out, flattened

642
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:19,875
platform on top of some mill of some kind. It
doesn't look like it's built for skyship purposes,

643
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:25,093
more than it's been haphazardly put together to
receive a skyship should it come to the city. But

644
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:30,198
it looks like that type of travel doesn't come to
this area too often. At this point in time, you

645
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:33,792
can see now, the crew is gathering their ropes,
they're getting ready to go ahead and lower it

646
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:38,818
down. Captain Damon is slowly steering and
shouting directions back and forth to his

647
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:50,046
deckhands. The Scalebearers and Kima come up to
the top of the ship, carrying the box that

648
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:55,348
contains the Horn of Orcus, as well. As the ship
slowly makes its way to dock on the top of this

649
00:31:55,348 --> 00:32:02,129
mill, Kima, who has all of her materials over her
shoulder, says, "All right, so. It's everyone's

650
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,973
"first time here in the city?"

651
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:05,018
SAM: Yes.

652
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:05,980
TRAVIS: Yeah.

653
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,307
SAM: Yeah, well. Keyleth?

654
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:08,606
ORION: I've never been here.

655
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:09,386
MARISHA: No.

656
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,217
SAM: Okay. Yes.

657
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:11,020
MATT: "All right."

658
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,241
ORION: And there's enough in the interim for a
short rest from us getting from there to the last

659
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:16,667
day to where we're at?

660
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,546
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

661
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:18,522
TRAVIS: A day's rest? All right.

662
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:19,543
ORION: Okay, cool. Awesome.

663
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:20,174
MATT: Yeah.

664
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:21,267
TRAVIS: Tiberius, you ever been here?

665
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:22,031
ORION: No.

666
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:23,013
(laughter)

667
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:26,191
LAURA: Is it cold in the city?

668
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:32,601
MATT: It's pretty chilly as you come down. I mean,
you wear furs naturally in cold environments, but

669
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:36,936
this is-- the temperature's to the point where you
may have to consider getting a little bit of

670
00:32:36,936 --> 00:32:39,043
warmer clothing if you travel too far outside of
the city.

671
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:41,082
TRAVIS: How do goliaths do? Not wearing much.

672
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:42,739
LAURA: I have a lot of winter cloaks already in
my--

673
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:44,232
SAM: We have some fancy cloaks, too, don't we?

674
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:45,980
LAURA: Well, those are fancy clothes.

675
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,806
SAM: Oh.

676
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:49,563
LAURA: But I've got winter coats that I bought for
the group a long time ago.

677
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,742
SAM: All right. Pass them out.

678
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:52,922
LAURA: All right.

679
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:55,372
MATT: So she pulls out the really nice, thick--

680
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:57,154
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. We went shopping.

681
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:58,041
LAURA: Remember?

682
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,983
MARISHA: I remember.

683
00:32:58,983 --> 00:32:59,962
ASHLEY: Oh, we went shopping.

684
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:01,068
TRAVIS: We have three other fancy robes.

685
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:01,908
ASHLEY: We had a girl shop day.

686
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:02,689
MARISHA: Yep.

687
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,940
SAM: A fancy. I want a fancy robe.

688
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,210
TRAVIS: You do? It's huge on you. You want it
anyway.

689
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,605
ORION: I'd have to take off my cloak, though, to
wear that, right?

690
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:08,334
MATT: Yeah.

691
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,435
ORION: I won't wear one. I keep my cloak on.

692
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:10,407
TRAVIS: I give you a colorful one.

693
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,195
SAM: I'll gird it.

694
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:13,061
MATT: We'll say you could probably put it over. It
will just look a little chunky.

695
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:13,951
ORION: Okay.

696
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:19,706
SAM: I'm going to take a large fancy robe and try
to tie it up-- to gird it so that it looks okay.

697
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,281
LAURA: He wants a fancy robe, not a fur.

698
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:22,560
TRAVIS: Be aware, we only have two left.

699
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,738
SAM: I'm going to gird my loins.

700
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:27,244
MATT: And you gird them well. You look like the
tiniest Turkish wrestler you've ever seen.

701
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:28,030
LAURA: Oh.

702
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,300
(laughter)

703
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,452
MATT: It's kind of adorable.

704
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:33,313
SAM: Also, I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt into
the Ioun Stone.

705
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:34,452
ORION: Yay.

706
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:38,042
MATT: Okay. So mark that down, you have a
third-level Lightning Bolt saved. You still used

707
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:42,940
the spell slot, but after you rest, it'll be safe
inside there. Which is an interesting experience,

708
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:49,169
you see him do this arcane finger wiggle in the
air, and then he releases what is a burst of

709
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:53,160
electrical energy that immediately funnels itself
and vanishes into the stone, which is now humming

710
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,982
with this low pulsing glow of greenish-blue
light.

711
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:57,743
SAM: (whispers) Pike, are you watching this?

712
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,406
ASHLEY: Wow, and you're--

713
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,619
LAURA: It's green? It's a green-- wait, is it like
a diamond shape?

714
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:02,761
SAM: I don't know.

715
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:04,701
LAURA: It's like a Sim!

716
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,157
MARISHA: Oh, it's like a Sims thing.

717
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:07,094
ORION: It's like a little--

718
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:08,583
LAURA: As long as it's green, you're happy,
Scanlan!

719
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:11,201
ORION: But I believe it's white, right? It's a
white stone?

720
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:14,458
MATT: It is a white stone, but the energy glowing
off it is greenish in color.

721
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,465
ORION: Ah, there you go.

722
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:16,303
MARISHA: He's happy.

723
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,528
ASHLEY: And you're so well-girded.

724
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:19,376
SAM: I'm girded and I've got a shiny head.

725
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:24,741
MATT: Eventually the ship comes to a stop. You
feel a little bit of a lurching sensation as the

726
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:31,872
ship suddenly halts its advancing. All the ropes
get dropped off the sides. They start bringing

727
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:37,602
what looks to be some sort of a haphazard crane
also, in preparation for Trinket to be lowered off

728
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:48,969
the ship. You can see, there's a look of-- I can't
describe it better than anxiousness to Kima. She

729
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,545
says, "If you have any questions about the city,
just speak up and I'll do my best."

730
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:54,294
LAURA: Where do we take the Horn?

731
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:55,442
SAM: (laughs) That's a good question.

732
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:56,599
(laughter)

733
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,509
MATT: "I believe--" And she looks over the edge of
the ship. "I believe our escorts will be happy to

734
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:00,794
"guide us."

735
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:01,633
LAURA: Our escorts?

736
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,824
LIAM: I'd like to do an insight check before we
hustle off.

737
00:35:03,824 --> 00:35:05,020
MATT: On?

738
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,765
TRAVIS: Kima.

739
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:06,539
LIAM: Kima.

740
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:07,585
MATT: Go for it.

741
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:10,630
ORION: I would like to look for any places-- oh,
sorry.

742
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,693
LIAM: I rolled an 18.

743
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,523
MATT: Okay, and what are you trying to glean off
of her?

744
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:23,165
LIAM: Why does she seem anxious? Does she seem
different? Does her demeanor seem different, or

745
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,243
does she just seem in a hurry?

746
00:35:25,243 --> 00:35:29,522
MATT: You can probably take it as a little bit of
being in a hurry, but you also get the feeling

747
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:42,251
like-- there's a nervousness to her that stems--
it's hard to really tell where it comes from, but

748
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:44,317
there is a nervousness to her.

749
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:47,349
LAURA: Kima, when was the last time you were with
your Order?

750
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,689
MATT: "Proper? That would be eight years."

751
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,694
LAURA: Oh.

752
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:55,343
ORION: That's a long time to be out of Order.

753
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:56,890
MATT: "Of which-- we are about to meet them."

754
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,700
ORION: Sorry.

755
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,927
SAM: High five.

756
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:00,319
LAURA: Do you get along well with them?

757
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:04,662
MATT: "Yes. Yes. They're just, well." (laughs)
"You'll see." And she leaps over the side of the

758
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:09,333
ship, grabbing the rope, and lowers herself down,
as do the rest of the-- the two Scalebearers come

759
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:14,751
down in tandem, clutching the chain on the sides
of the box, bringing it down almost like a big

760
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:15,922
Jacob's ladder.

761
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:17,558
TRAVIS: (quietly) I love you.

762
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:20,364
MATT: Eventually, you all make your way onto the
platform, and they're waiting for you. You see

763
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:27,596
there's a cluster of well-armored men and women,
wearing semi-matching gray tabards over patchwork

764
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:36,316
and plated armor. They look like a really
rough-and-tumble militia, but they all stand firm

765
00:36:36,316 --> 00:36:41,640
and as you guys walk up, they give a nod of
respect and understanding. Amongst them, you see

766
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,356
one gentleman, an elderly gentleman with no hair,
completely bald, thick spectacles on the tip of

767
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:51,855
his nose, wearing the same silver and blue robes
as the envoys that met you at the Council of

768
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:57,731
Tal'Dorei, the ones that are carrying the box. As
you all approach, Kima steps out ahead and says,

769
00:36:57,731 --> 00:37:00,629
"Yonn. It's been a while."

770
00:37:00,629 --> 00:37:02,051
SAM: Yonn.

771
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:07,524
MATT: The old man steps forward. "It has been,
indeed, Kima. It has, indeed. And that's

772
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:10,343
"Scalebearer Yonn, if you don't mind--"

773
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,014
TRAVIS: Scalebearer.

774
00:37:12,014 --> 00:37:16,994
MATT: "I would prefer in mixed company the proper
niceties of our presentation."

775
00:37:16,994 --> 00:37:19,033
LAURA: Oh, we're no proper company. It's all
right.

776
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,667
MATT: "Hm. And you are?"

777
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,501
SAM: We are--

778
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:28,814
ORION: I'm Tiberius Stormwind, and we are Vox
Machina. Everybody has names, too.

779
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:29,857
LAURA: Hmm.

780
00:37:29,857 --> 00:37:30,736
ASHLEY: I'm Pike.

781
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:33,097
MARISHA: Keyleth.

782
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:36,862
SAM: I'm Ioun Stone-bearer Scanlan.

783
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:39,161
(laughter)

784
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:40,476
MATT: He cocks his head curiously.

785
00:37:40,476 --> 00:37:42,432
SAM: You can call me Kingslayer.

786
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,087
I also did that.

787
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:48,527
MATT: "Very well." Percy introduces himself, as
well.

788
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:50,279
TRAVIS: I have a beard.

789
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,027
(laughter)

790
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:56,378
MATT: He gives you the most curious look of all,
which is hard to follow off of Scanlan over here.

791
00:37:56,378 --> 00:38:03,960
"And I'm to understand these are the bearers of
the artifact?" Kima gives a nod. "Yes, and I think

792
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:08,933
"we should be on our way quickly." "Yes, yes, of
course. Please. These are our escorts. Follow

793
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:15,596
"suit. We will bring you onward to the Platinum
Sanctuary proper to dispose of this thing."

794
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:19,270
SAM: How far is the Platinum Sanctuary?

795
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,854
MATT: "No more than a 25-minute walk."

796
00:38:21,854 --> 00:38:22,724
LAURA and SAM: Oh.

797
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:24,230
ASHLEY: May I insight-check Yonn?

798
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,159
MATT: You may.

799
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,109
LIAM: Yes, please.

800
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:27,034
MARISHA: Oh, so--

801
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,816
ORION: I'm going to look for any temples that
might have a sigil inside while we're going

802
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:31,766
through the town.

803
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:35,837
MATT: All right. Do you want to ask around about
that?

804
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:39,371
ORION: I'll ask the Yonn guy.

805
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:42,128
MATT: Okay. Well, first off, you finish your
insight check. What did you roll?

806
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:43,362
ASHLEY: What did you get, Liam?

807
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,409
LIAM: 13.

808
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:46,514
ASHLEY: Okay. I got 15.

809
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:52,604
MATT: Okay. He seems stuffy. He seems definitely
dedicated to whatever his intent is, but there

810
00:38:52,604 --> 00:38:57,585
doesn't seem to be anything deceptive in his
speech.

811
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:02,824
MARISHA: So am I correct to assume our plan is
that we're going to march this Horn through the

812
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:05,265
town? Until we get to the temple?

813
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:06,616
LAURA: Well, nobody knows what it is.

814
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:07,504
ORION: Right.

815
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:08,383
SAM: Well, unless someone--

816
00:39:08,383 --> 00:39:09,863
LAURA: So we'll just be aware there's a huge
envoy.

817
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:12,268
MARISHA: I mean, we can only assume-- Yonn?

818
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,416
MATT: "Yes?"

819
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:17,073
MARISHA: How many people in this city are aware of
this Horn being brought here?

820
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:30,536
MATT: "Well, up until now, other than myself, you
travelers, and the Highbearer Vord himself, no one else."

821
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:31,501
ORION: Hm.

822
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:32,732
MARISHA: Highbearer Vor-- his name is Vord?

823
00:39:32,732 --> 00:39:34,274
MATT: "Vord. The Highbearer of the Platinum
Dragon."

824
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:35,641
LAURA: What kind of man is he?

825
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:39,843
MATT: You hear when he mentions Vord, Kima
twitches a little bit, and you remember Kima's

826
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:42,489
official title is Lady Kima of Vord.

827
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,415
LAURA AND ORION: Hm.

828
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,098
SAM: Her ex?

829
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:46,419
TRAVIS: Is that her pops? Her pops?

830
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:47,711
ORION: Vonn. Yonn?

831
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:50,601
MATT: "Scalebearer Yonn, yes."

832
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:56,082
ORION: Oh, Scalebearer Yonn, that's a fun name.
(clears throat) As we travel through town, if you

833
00:39:56,082 --> 00:40:02,255
could point me to any place that would have a
sigil of arcane-ness--

834
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:05,330
SAM: Arcane-iosity is what he's trying to say.

835
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,479
MATT: "There are none."

836
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,235
ORION: Oh.

837
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:13,080
MATT: "This city, arcane magic for the most part,
is not allowed within consistent practice. This is

838
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:14,927
"a divine, a holy place."

839
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:15,767
ORION: Ah.

840
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:20,960
MATT: "And the arcane tends to, ah. How do you
say, when unwatched, corrupt and destroy from the

841
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,312
"inside. "

842
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:25,183
LIAM: Oh shit, Tiberius.

843
00:40:25,183 --> 00:40:28,421
ORION: No, I'm fine! He's talking about other
people.

844
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:32,287
TRAVIS: You don't have any arcane abilities
anyway, right?

845
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:34,188
ORION: Oh of course I do, I'm a sorcerer.

846
00:40:34,188 --> 00:40:35,570
LAURA: No no no, right?

847
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,608
SAM: Ix-nay.

848
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,636
TRAVIS: Wink wink, nudge nudge.

849
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,930
ORION: No, no, I think he-- sure.

850
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:44,596
MATT: "This here in Vasselheim, the cradle of
faith, the Dawn City, of once all civilization and

851
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:52,291
"current faith once stemmed from. There is no way
in but by foot. It is a pilgrimage, a journey for

852
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:57,287
"each to come here, and those that stay, stay of
their own will and divine right." And as he refers

853
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:02,624
to the guards, each guard you see now has around
their neck a very visibly shown holy symbol of

854
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:06,672
some kind of deity. Most seem to fall--

855
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,586
MARISHA: We've basically walked into the
Crucible.

856
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:09,663
ORION: It's fine.

857
00:41:09,663 --> 00:41:15,394
MATT: -- into the realm of Arathis, Avandra,
Melora, and a couple with Bahamut. None of--

858
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:16,650
ASHLEY: None of Sarenrae.

859
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,790
MATT: None of Sarenrae.

860
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,882
TRAVIS: Or as Liam calls it, Sa-REN-rae.

861
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:19,921
LAURA: The best one?

862
00:41:19,921 --> 00:41:20,851
ASHLEY: The best, the best one.

863
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:21,926
LIAM: Sa-REN-rae!

864
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:22,937
(laughter)

865
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:23,851
ASHLEY: Sarenrae!

866
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:26,470
ORION: I'm going to take it you don't see very
many dragonborn in these parts.

867
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,341
MATT: "No, and frankly you're making me a bit
nervous."

868
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:29,187
ORION: Oh.

869
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:34,994
MATT: "However, as we ourselves are followers of
the Platinum Dragon, we understand that it is

870
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:42,165
"dragonkind at the heart of it, the metallics, that
bring life and civilization and order to this

871
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,150
"world."

872
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,348
ORION: Yes.

873
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:46,507
MATT: "Your color I find off-putting."

874
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:47,381
ORION: It's--

875
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,069
LAURA: I've always noticed a fine metallic sheen
coming from your red scales.

876
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:55,296
ORION: No, I'm of the chromatic nature, I'm a bit
of an anomaly in my family, they're all of the

877
00:41:55,344 --> 00:42:01,423
metallic brand, I assure you. The Stormwind name
runs true and wide throughout Draconia, but--

878
00:42:01,423 --> 00:42:03,772
MATT: "I have heard of the Stormwinds, yes."

879
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:09,205
ORION: I cast Alter Self real quick and I turn
myself into, I believe, gold. Because that's the

880
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:12,315
red-- equivalent of red. On the metallic scale.

881
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:14,014
MATT: Okay. He gives you a curious look and
goes--

882
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:16,751
ORION: I think that would be better for everyone
involved.

883
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:22,684
MATT: "I would be mindful to not do such things so
openly in public in the future."

884
00:42:22,684 --> 00:42:23,769
ORION: Oh, sorry.

885
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:31,890
MATT: "Ahem." And he kind of adjusts his robe.
"This way please, follow me." And Scalebearer Yonn

886
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,689
leads you--

887
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:34,843
LAURA: You look very nice, Tiberius.

888
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:35,858
ASHLEY: You look really great in gold.

889
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:37,019
ORION: Thank you, thank you.

890
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:38,106
MARISHA: So wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.

891
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:38,776
TRAVIS: What?

892
00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:39,925
MARISHA: Before we move on-- we're about to leave,
I'm assuming?

893
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:43,724
MATT: You're stepping off the platform onto a
staircase that leads off of the top of the mill.

894
00:42:43,724 --> 00:42:48,774
MARISHA: Should a few of us kind of like flank
around and--

895
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,195
LAURA: Definitely, we should all kind of surround
the box, sure.

896
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,493
TRAVIS: Like rooftops and shit.

897
00:42:52,493 --> 00:42:53,459
MARISHA: Rooftop shit, yeah.

898
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:54,230
LAURA: Oh.

899
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,081
TRAVIS: I like it.

900
00:42:55,081 --> 00:42:56,413
MARISHA: I can go eagle form and have aerial
support.

901
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:57,475
TRAVIS: I love it.

902
00:42:57,475 --> 00:43:00,317
LAURA: I can stick to the rooftops, I guess, try
to follow along.

903
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:01,356
TRAVIS: Overwatch.

904
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:02,625
MARISHA: Overwatch. What's that? Yeah.

905
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,174
LAURA: I'll snick to the rooftops and try to
follow along, sniper eye.

906
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:05,116
MARISHA: Okay.

907
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,122
TRAVIS: Yeah, you two up top.

908
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:07,667
ASHLEY: I'll just stay right on the path.

909
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:08,630
TRAVIS: Yep, you and me.

910
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,742
MATT: All right.

911
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:10,983
TRAVIS: Smash hands.

912
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:12,166
MATT: All right, so.

913
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,389
ORION: I'll take the six.

914
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:14,632
MATT: Okay. As you--

915
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:17,961
LIAM: I'm gonna stay with it but try to blend in
with the crowd.

916
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,574
MATT: All right, all right. Go ahead and make a
stealth check.

917
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:21,839
LIAM: Yes.

918
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,135
TRAVIS: Scanlan?

919
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:26,257
LIAM: 23 for stealth.

920
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:29,258
MATT: All right, ah, if you wouldn't mind, Vex,
making a stealth check as well?

921
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:30,135
LAURA: Oh.

922
00:43:30,135 --> 00:43:31,141
TRAVIS: Overwatch.

923
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,329
MATT: Just to keep your rooftop activity
inconspicuous.

924
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,513
LAURA: Not disturbing.

925
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:35,391
TRAVIS: We have a UAV.

926
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:37,076
LAURA: Oh, well I rolled a one. So that's lovely.

927
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:38,101
MATT: Okay.

928
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:39,303
SAM: Are you flying up above?

929
00:43:39,303 --> 00:43:40,473
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going eagle.

930
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:42,107
TRAVIS: Don't you have advantage?

931
00:43:42,107 --> 00:43:45,755
LAURA: Do I have advantage in-- no.

932
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:48,173
ORION: And I'm taking up the rear, following
behind.

933
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:49,596
MATT: No. Not in this terrain, unfortunately.

934
00:43:49,596 --> 00:43:50,577
ASHLEY: But there are forests here.

935
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:51,924
LAURA: But with the forests I'd be amazing.

936
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,976
LIAM: I do applaud your honesty, though, sister.

937
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:54,821
LAURA: Yeah.

938
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:59,391
MATT: So as you loudly clomp up and begin
rooftop-hopping, a few individuals in the city

939
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:01,433
kind of take notice and they point up, which by
the way--

940
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,710
LAURA: I wink at them as I'm climbing up.

941
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:09,996
MATT: Ah, the classic Vex wink. All right, so.
Just you guys-- kind of atmosphere, as you step down

942
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:13,976
the staircase and get to the main city street
proper, the first thing you notice, the roads

943
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:22,243
themselves are not cobblestone, are not brick,
they are mud. They are thick, recently sleeted

944
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:29,380
mud. You hear the clomping of horse hooves as
carts are pulled through and each one is a sickly

945
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,629
(squelch) sound as each footstep makes it through.
The people of this city are a very hardened and

946
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:42,448
rugged folk. Most clothing is swathed in furs and
thick leathers, armor is patchwork in itself, most

947
00:44:42,448 --> 00:44:45,736
of the men grow coarse facial hair and the women
themselves, their hair is wild and their

948
00:44:45,736 --> 00:44:53,525
appearance very stoic and grizzled. The landscape
of Vasselheim-- oh, thank you kindly. Delivery of

949
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:54,590
our chicken.

950
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,940
MARISHA: Chicken through the magic door.

951
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,864
MATT: The people who live here, you gather,
quickly walking through-- and Kima gives you a bit

952
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:10,474
of insight as well-- live here not because it's
easy to live, not because there's many comforts,

953
00:45:10,532 --> 00:45:15,119
it's a very harsh living in the city of
Vasselheim. But the city is also currently the

954
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,875
oldest known bastion of civilization in the world.
As far as it's understood, most human

955
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:26,863
civilization, and a lot of humans believe pre-elf
and pre-dwarf, although the dwarves and elves very

956
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:32,283
staunchly disagree, all stemmed from this city,
which is believed to be tens of thousands of years

957
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:39,848
old. They have uncovered the single oldest temples
to the main deities of good and neutrality within

958
00:45:39,848 --> 00:45:44,875
this city, and as such it is considered the
holiest place in the modern world, which is why it

959
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:51,422
has been through many, many wars and has seen much
warfare and strife and difficulty. And those that

960
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:56,120
live here live here because they feel that they
can fight against this, and they actually call it

961
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,864
a privilege to exist in this harsh landscape as
devotion to their respective deities. Also,

962
00:46:01,864 --> 00:46:06,531
because it is such a holy place, this is why the
arcane is considered, for the most part, profane

963
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:09,815
in public and very carefully controlled otherwise.

964
00:46:09,815 --> 00:46:12,872
TRAVIS: So we gotta be sneaky with that.

965
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:14,036
LAURA: Yeah.

966
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:15,809
MATT: The buildings look old--

967
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,843
TRAVIS: So I'll put my spells in my back pocket
for now.

968
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:22,825
MATT: The buildings range from old to newer stone,
warped wood from just the weather itself. You can

969
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:28,167
see a lot of the wood has a kind of mossy texture
to it just from the general overgrowth that tends

970
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:36,320
to take the city. It's not kept for beauty, it's
kept for function. There's scars across most of

971
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:42,264
the buildings where you can see warfare has bled
into the city, and there are markings and various

972
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:46,429
points of ancient damage and certain structures
that have not been rebuilt, that have just been

973
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:50,185
left in ruin where they stand, because they have
not yet found somebody or a purpose to be

974
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:57,678
restructured. It's a very different landscape than
what you're used to, and the walk itself is a very

975
00:46:57,678 --> 00:47:01,429
solemn, quiet walk through the city. The folks
that do take notice just kind of give a nod of

976
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:07,855
acknowledgement or a gruff grunt as they pass by.
There doesn't seem to be a definite interest in

977
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:12,412
your travel, this isn't a special occasion. It
seems like travelers and strange occurrences are

978
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,908
not that unnatural in this city.

979
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:18,583
MARISHA: Okay. So it's like New York.

980
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,386
MATT: You could say that, yeah. It's a very
ancient New York.

981
00:47:22,386 --> 00:47:25,916
SAM: And we're carrying a large ark, or a box of
some sort?

982
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:30,784
MATT: You are carrying the platinum box that the
Horn was kept in.

983
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:32,335
SAM: How big is it?

984
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:35,027
MATT: It's approximately like a foot and a half,
or two feet by two feet.

985
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:36,372
ASHLEY: Oh, Taliesin's here.

986
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:37,376
LAURA: Oh!

987
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:38,390
TRAVIS: Taliesin's outside.

988
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,358
SAM: And it's platinum? It's just a platinum box?

989
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,478
MATT: Yes, it is made of like solid platinum and
silver with a series of very, very intricate

990
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:46,467
scrolling and engravings on it.

991
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:47,751
MARISHA: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?

992
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:49,491
LAURA: There were some sapphires in there, too,
some blue sapphires, I remember.

993
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,516
MATT: Yes, yes.

994
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:52,193
MARISHA: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?

995
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:58,108
MATT: Best you can tell, there are people taking
notice of it, but none that like stop and gawk,

996
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,777
they just kind of, "huh." Keep walking.

997
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,802
MARISHA: Damn, maybe we should've thrown a blanket
or something over it.

998
00:48:02,802 --> 00:48:05,916
MATT: You could if you want to, now.

999
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,803
TRAVIS: Can we, though?

1000
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:13,362
MARISHA: Burlap sack or something? Anybody?

1001
00:48:13,362 --> 00:48:17,131
MATT: The guards still flanking you guys,
surrounding this ensemble as it presses towards

1002
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:24,888
the base of the mountain. You make your way
towards the edge of the mountain, or where the

1003
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:28,649
mountain begins at the bottom of the floor, and
you can see dozens of staircases ascending the

1004
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:35,694
outskirts of this giant pointed cragless spire
that just sticks up into, actually, the clouds cut

1005
00:48:35,694 --> 00:48:41,484
off the top of it. It's reminiscent of Gatshadow,
the mountain outside of Westruun that you guys

1006
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:42,693
traveled to long ago.

1007
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:43,672
TRAVIS: Right.

1008
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:49,253
MATT: But even larger. You continue up this
staircase, and the stonework itself is a little

1009
00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:53,205
lopsided and awkward, and with each step sometimes
you have to kinda catch yourself, especially as

1010
00:48:53,205 --> 00:48:56,148
the wind begins to pick up the higher up the
mountain you go, and it takes about 15 to 20

1011
00:48:56,148 --> 00:49:01,540
minutes to ascend this staircase. Your legs begin
to grow a little sore, until eventually you reach

1012
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:08,724
the base of what you can only imagine is the
Platinum Sanctuary. You see before you, built into

1013
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:16,043
the side of the rock of this mountain, a grand
stone fortress that looks older than time in

1014
00:49:16,043 --> 00:49:21,261
itself. You can see the elements have weathered to
the point where even the solid points and how the

1015
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:28,719
stonework was meant to be an edge has been rounded
and smoothed down. There are a series of silver

1016
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,676
markings across the outskirts of it, which
Tiberius, you recognize as Draconic.

1017
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:36,212
ORION: Look, Percy, it's Draconic.

1018
00:49:36,212 --> 00:49:37,578
TALIESIN: Oh, so it is.

1019
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:39,976
(laughter)

1020
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,738
MATT: Certain words in Draconic--

1021
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:44,637
MARISHA: Percy, you've been so quiet here lately.

1022
00:49:44,637 --> 00:49:46,054
TALIESIN: I don't want to talk about it.

1023
00:49:46,054 --> 00:49:54,492
MATT: You see phrases emblazoned on the side of
this giant temple that say things like "honor,

1024
00:49:54,492 --> 00:50:02,687
justice." Various, very old base Draconic stuff.
The current language is a more refined version.

1025
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:05,470
This is a very, very ancient basis of that language.

1026
00:50:05,634 --> 00:50:10,573
ORION: See that, Scanlan? That says something like
Apollo Justice something.

1027
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:12,300
SAM: It's Phoenix something.

1028
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,987
ORION: It's maybe the rise of the justice of the
phoenix.

1029
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,873
SAM: Nah, I don't know.

1030
00:50:17,873 --> 00:50:19,258
ORION: It's a lot of things.

1031
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:20,279
TRAVIS: Dawn of justice--

1032
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:23,470
MATT: On the top of this fortress, you see three
constructs that don't match the stone structure.

1033
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:28,003
These may have been constructed or built many
years later and have been added onto the temple.

1034
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:35,324
But three ivory and silver spires, towers that
ascend from the top of the fortress itself, almost

1035
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:40,963
parallel to the very steep mountainside that this
fortress is built into. You come to the front

1036
00:50:40,963 --> 00:50:49,991
doors of this structure. Two very, very large gray
stone doors with almost what looks like white

1037
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:54,864
marbling through them, and you can see, mostly
worn away but still barely visible, the symbol of

1038
00:50:54,924 --> 00:51:00,646
a shield with a dragon head emblazoned on the
front of it, the symbol of Bahamut. As the

1039
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:06,371
Scalebearer-- yes, that there-- as the
Scalebearers approach the front, the doors, on

1040
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:11,946
their own, and open to the interior, the grinding
sound of stone across the marble flooring of the

1041
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:17,005
fortress proper. You can see the interior. Did you
have a question?

1042
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:20,480
MARISHA: Can I see inside the temple? Or are the
temples pretty enclosed?

1043
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,957
MATT: You can see now as the doors begin to open.

1044
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:23,329
MARISHA: Well, I was an eagle flying overhead.

1045
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:24,080
MATT: Oh, yes! You--

1046
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,511
MARISHA: And I was gonna do a perception check to
see if I noticed, like kinda do a loop

1047
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:28,578
of the temple.

1048
00:51:28,578 --> 00:51:29,701
MATT: Go for it.

1049
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:30,993
SAM: So, I'm an eagle.

1050
00:51:30,993 --> 00:51:32,988
MARISHA: So I'm an eagle right now, so.

1051
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:36,124
TALIESIN: You're such an eagle. Oh my god.

1052
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:39,446
LAURA: I very, very poorly fall off of the roof
and clamber down.

1053
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:41,300
MARISHA: 20 total.

1054
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:50,336
MATT: Best you can tell, there are for the
makeshift guards in the city-- which, you've heard

1055
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:55,889
them referred to as Bastions, they're all
volunteers, and actually from what you gather

1056
00:51:55,889 --> 00:52:01,843
here, probably a quarter of the populace are
Bastions. So they have a very, very heavy

1057
00:52:01,843 --> 00:52:05,993
civilian-based militia that guards this city.

1058
00:52:05,993 --> 00:52:09,140
SAM: Are those the guys who were with us, the 
envoys?

1059
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,040
MATT: Yes. No, no, not the envoys, the envoys'
come from the temple of Bahamut, they have

1060
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:18,254
the blue and silver robes. You see, they're just
wearing makeshift patchwork armor, whatever that

1061
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:22,530
could be scavenged or constructed to outfit a
militia, essentially.

1062
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,814
SAM: Okay.

1063
00:52:23,814 --> 00:52:30,547
MATT: You see them going up and down every which
staircase, just doing various passes and

1064
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:34,055
patrolwork. Some of them have spyglasses and you
see them looking off in the distance, and as

1065
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:37,800
you're getting higher up the mountain, too, you
look out about, and you can see the entire forest

1066
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:44,295
around you. Very thick, ominous, and you swear
every now and then you can see some trees move

1067
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:48,543
suddenly and heavily before coming to rest in the
distance.

1068
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:50,151
MARISHA: I'm gonna go check that out first.

1069
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:55,430
MATT: The rest of you are entering the temple.
Keyleth is not there.

1070
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,849
ORION: Is it lit in there?

1071
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:58,559
MATT: The doors close behind you.

1072
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,330
SAM: Hope Keyleth is okay.

1073
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,611
LAURA: Keyleth--

1074
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,917
MARISHA: (eagle noises)

1075
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:10,003
LIAM: I don't think that I was with the group, I
think I was back with the crowd--

1076
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:10,897
LAURA: No, you--

1077
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:11,858
SAM: Great.

1078
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:14,382
LIAM: -- so I see the eagle fly off and I'm just
gonna follow after her.

1079
00:53:14,382 --> 00:53:16,094
LAURA: What?

1080
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:17,662
MATT: The eagle flies out of the city.

1081
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:18,865
LIAM: Yeah.

1082
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:20,997
LAURA: You're gonna leave the city, brother?

1083
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,009
LIAM: No.

1084
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,340
ORION: You're leaving?

1085
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,726
MARISHA: Gonna see if I can figure out what's
making the trees move.

1086
00:53:24,726 --> 00:53:26,007
LIAM: Now that I understand the--

1087
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:27,141
LAURA: Come on in the temple.

1088
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:28,752
LIAM: But do I still get shut in my face? So.

1089
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:30,109
MARISHA: I'm flying! I'm fine.

1090
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:34,157
LIAM: It's a big solid building, doors are shut,
that's it?

1091
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:37,402
MATT: Yeah, I mean, the temple, would you like to
enter the temple with the rest of the group?

1092
00:53:37,402 --> 00:53:38,715
LAURA: Yeah, you would.

1093
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,720
ASHLEY: Yeah, do it.

1094
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,052
MATT: All right.

1095
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,162
LIAM: Yeah.

1096
00:53:42,162 --> 00:53:46,697
MATT: So just as the doors are closing, you rush
out of your subtle following pattern and, wait,

1097
00:53:46,697 --> 00:53:49,669
and put your hands up and manage to make your way
into the temple right before the doors close,

1098
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:52,704
catching up with the rest of the group. Keyleth,
make a perception check.

1099
00:53:52,704 --> 00:53:57,002
MARISHA: I have advantage because I'm an eagle.
Ooh, natural 20!

1100
00:53:57,002 --> 00:53:58,390
SAM and TRAVIS: Nice!

1101
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,215
TALIESIN: On the shiny die.

1102
00:54:00,215 --> 00:54:01,453
MATT: All right.

1103
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:02,928
ORION: It is on the shiny die.

1104
00:54:02,928 --> 00:54:09,106
MATT: It's hard to see much of anything because
the canopy of this forest is so dense and so

1105
00:54:09,106 --> 00:54:14,173
thick, and the snowfall itself, which is getting
stronger through the air, and is kind of obscuring

1106
00:54:14,173 --> 00:54:18,595
some of your vision, but you glance down and you
see another set of trees shift suddenly about a

1107
00:54:18,595 --> 00:54:24,405
quarter-mile away from the city's walls. And you
can see on the edge of the city wall a number of

1108
00:54:24,405 --> 00:54:28,930
guards are beginning to swarm up to the ballista
and starting to load them and prepare them. You

1109
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:34,846
glance down, and all you see are something
fast-moving beneath the canopy, something large.

1110
00:54:34,846 --> 00:54:44,730
Something you can swear you see it looks
serpentine-like. But multiple serpentine-like

1111
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,227
bodies or forms. And then it's gone in a second.

1112
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:49,358
LAURA: Hydra! You think it's a hydra?

1113
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:51,239
ORION: I don't want it to be a hydra.

1114
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:53,340
LIAM: Stop gasping, I don't see shit, Laura.

1115
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,352
ORION: Oh, that's right.

1116
00:54:54,352 --> 00:54:55,676
LAURA: Shut up!

1117
00:54:55,676 --> 00:55:00,774
MATT: You see a couple ballista set loose. The
bolts go flying through the air, entering the

1118
00:55:00,774 --> 00:55:08,920
forest. You can hear a loud screeching sound, and
a few dozen forests now begin to shake to the side

1119
00:55:09,075 --> 00:55:13,159
as the creature makes its way away from the city
before going still in the distance.

1120
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:14,272
MARISHA: Okay.

1121
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:16,589
MATT: You get the sensation that this is a--

1122
00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:17,734
MARISHA: A common occurrence.

1123
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,299
MATT: -- a common occurrence.

1124
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:22,830
MARISHA: Okay. Good to know. I'm going to loop
back around. Is there like an open window in the

1125
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:25,569
temple that I can just fly through--

1126
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:29,102
ORION: Ooh. Is there a super clear one that she
could try to go through first?

1127
00:55:29,102 --> 00:55:32,108
MARISHA: Be like that Windex commercial, back in
the day.

1128
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:34,120
MATT: The temple--

1129
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,981
ORION: (crashing sounds) Dammit!

1130
00:55:35,981 --> 00:55:37,750
MATT: You make your way--

1131
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,006
MARISHA: I break my neck, I die.

1132
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:39,983
ORION: No.

1133
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:42,868
MATT: There are small-- they are not windows, more
than they are slits for arrow defense.

1134
00:55:42,868 --> 00:55:43,735
TRAVIS: Right.

1135
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:47,166
MATT: You as Keyleth could squeeze through. It
would be one of those things where you have to

1136
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:50,387
careen in, transform, and then squeeze through.

1137
00:55:50,387 --> 00:55:51,957
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do that.

1138
00:55:51,957 --> 00:55:55,542
MATT: Which you do, and as you do, you come right
into the face of a spear right there--

1139
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:59,908
LAURA: (gasps) You should have transformed into a
fly.

1140
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:02,128
MATT: -- as another one of the Platinum Dragon
guards says, "Who goes there?"

1141
00:56:02,128 --> 00:56:03,181
SAM: Oh boy.

1142
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:06,663
MARISHA: Hi. Hi.

1143
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,370
MATT: Another guard begins to approach from the
side.

1144
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:15,478
MARISHA: I am with Vox Machina. I'm pretty sure
they just came through the front door. It's cool.

1145
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:20,512
I was just doing-- just like aerial support. I'm
just going to go and reconnect with my group.

1146
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:21,904
It's fine.

1147
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:23,263
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1148
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:24,415
MARISHA: I'm Keyleth.

1149
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,102
TRAVIS: (whispers) Mention the Scalebearer.

1150
00:56:26,102 --> 00:56:27,412
MARISHA: I'm not good at this shit.

1151
00:56:27,412 --> 00:56:28,428
MATT: You're not there, Grog.

1152
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:29,893
MARISHA: What am I doing? A persuasion check?

1153
00:56:29,893 --> 00:56:30,887
MATT: Yeah.

1154
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:31,915
MARISHA: Christ.

1155
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:32,821
ORION: You're going to roll a one.

1156
00:56:32,821 --> 00:56:33,807
MATT: Sorry, Miss Charisma.

1157
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,616
MARISHA: Shut up.

1158
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:35,644
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

1159
00:56:35,644 --> 00:56:37,397
MARISHA: Oh, wait. I don't know why I'm rolling
two.

1160
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:38,895
TALIESIN: That's real funny.

1161
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,375
MARISHA: Six?

1162
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,434
LAURA: Oh no!

1163
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:42,855
SAM: Keyleth's dead.

1164
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:45,505
ORION: (whispers) No, they'll probably just put
her in prison.

1165
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:47,774
MATT: The guy holding the spear to you keeps it
there. The other guy walks up behind and says,

1166
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:51,789
"Let me see your hands."

1167
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:52,956
LAURA: (gasps)

1168
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:55,375
LIAM: Shit.

1169
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:56,634
MARISHA: Why?

1170
00:56:56,634 --> 00:57:04,982
MATT: "Let me see your hands." He takes your
hands, pulls out a set of shackles--

1171
00:57:04,982 --> 00:57:05,906
LAURA: (gasps)

1172
00:57:05,906 --> 00:57:06,763
ASHLEY: Oh no.

1173
00:57:06,763 --> 00:57:07,770
MATT: -- and locks them on.

1174
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,187
LAURA: This is the second time you've been
arrested!

1175
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:10,315
MARISHA: Yeah, it is.

1176
00:57:10,315 --> 00:57:13,872
MATT: The guy with spear turns behind you and just
holds it to your back as the gentleman who just

1177
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:16,630
cuffed you grabs the chain between and starts
pulling you towards the main chamber.

1178
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,402
MARISHA: You know, can we just buzz by the front
foyer, and then we'll find my friends, and then

1179
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:23,257
we'll all be like, hey, those are my-- It'll be
fine.

1180
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:24,558
ORION: I think that's where you're going.

1181
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:28,937
MATT: He leads you down the stairway to an area
where it opens up into a small courtyard, takes

1182
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:34,350
you to the right of the courtyard into a central
chamber, where the rest of Vox Machina is

1183
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,565
currently being led.

1184
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:36,694
LAURA: Keyleth!

1185
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:37,811
ORION: Do I see her?

1186
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:39,945
MATT: Yeah, you guys all see her being led in, in
cuffs, essentially.

1187
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:42,701
ORION: Seriously? Again?

1188
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:44,064
TRAVIS: What did you do?

1189
00:57:44,064 --> 00:57:45,075
LAURA: Again, Keyleth?

1190
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:46,249
ORION: Your Highness, what is your problem?

1191
00:57:46,249 --> 00:57:50,084
ASHLEY: Oh. She's with us. She's with us, she was
just outside, we got in before.

1192
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:51,586
TRAVIS: No, we don't know who she is.

1193
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:53,607
TALIESIN: Actually, can we have a few minutes to
discuss this?

1194
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:54,893
MARISHA: Shut up, Grog!

1195
00:57:54,893 --> 00:57:58,159
MATT: At this point, Kima turns and says, "She's
with me."

1196
00:57:58,159 --> 00:57:59,193
LAURA: Oh.

1197
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:03,635
MATT: And both the Scalebearers go, "Lady Kima, I
am so sorry." And they go ahead and take the cuffs

1198
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:05,925
off real fast and pull the spear back and step
back.

1199
00:58:05,925 --> 00:58:06,741
ASHLEY: Wow.

1200
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:07,818
LAURA: Yeah, you listen to Lady Kima.

1201
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:08,594
ORION: The classic.

1202
00:58:08,594 --> 00:58:09,432
MARISHA: The classic.

1203
00:58:09,432 --> 00:58:10,536
ORION: The classic handcuff wrist twist.

1204
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:11,703
MARISHA: Ouch.

1205
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:13,061
LIAM: Hardass.

1206
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:14,455
(laughter)

1207
00:58:14,455 --> 00:58:16,777
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm with her.

1208
00:58:16,777 --> 00:58:20,488
MATT: They back off and bow deeply and escort
themselves off, embarrassed.

1209
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:21,580
MARISHA: Did you guys see that?

1210
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,576
ASHLEY: That was cool.

1211
00:58:22,576 --> 00:58:23,765
ORION: I nudge Grog.

1212
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:25,068
TRAVIS: That was cool. You were arrested.

1213
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,739
ORION: Grog, Grog, I'm nudging you.

1214
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:27,896
TRAVIS: You hadn't done anything.

1215
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:28,854
TALIESIN: I knew you had it in you.

1216
00:58:28,854 --> 00:58:30,014
MARISHA: I'm starting to feel so hardcore.

1217
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:31,001
ORION: I'm just nudging you.

1218
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:31,787
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

1219
00:58:31,787 --> 00:58:33,093
ORION: Because Kima did something super hot.

1220
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:33,999
TALIESIN: You need a tattoo.

1221
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:35,028
MARISHA: I do need a tattoo.

1222
00:58:35,028 --> 00:58:36,907
TRAVIS: I know, I noticed. She doesn't love me,
though.

1223
00:58:36,907 --> 00:58:38,147
LAURA: She does, Grog.

1224
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:39,233
TRAVIS: No, not yet.

1225
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:42,452
MATT: All right. Scalebearer Yonn continues to
lead you through this main chamber. And this

1226
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:46,121
chamber, like I said, it's the temple. It's
strange, because most temples you've seen to

1227
00:58:46,121 --> 00:58:50,906
Bahamut or many other deities are extravagant or
are, you know, built with a modern-day sense of

1228
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:58,895
architecture. This is a very plain, simple stone
fortress. It's hard to grasp what time it was

1229
00:58:58,895 --> 00:59:04,398
built, but just the smell itself seems very
ancient. There's a scent of dust and age, and

1230
00:59:04,398 --> 00:59:11,919
functionality to its construct. But there's still
a sense of power to it. Especially you, Pike,

1231
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:16,533
where you're sensitive to divine energy. This
whole place is humming with it. Even though it's

1232
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:22,197
not the kind you're used to connecting with. This
is-- When they say this is a holy place, you can

1233
00:59:22,197 --> 00:59:23,701
feel it.

1234
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:26,151
LAURA: Is everything okay, Pike?

1235
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:31,974
ASHLEY: It's just-- there's a lot of holiness
here.

1236
00:59:31,974 --> 00:59:33,696
(laughter)

1237
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:34,794
ORION: I would imagine.

1238
00:59:34,794 --> 00:59:35,709
MARISHA: Oh.

1239
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:37,783
SAM: On a scale from one to five, five being super
holy--

1240
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,546
ASHLEY: Probably six.

1241
00:59:39,546 --> 00:59:40,369
SAM: Whoa.

1242
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,229
LAURA: Whoa.

1243
00:59:41,229 --> 00:59:42,066
MARISHA: (gasps)

1244
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:43,151
ORION: That's extra holy.

1245
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:44,266
MARISHA: This temple goes to six.

1246
00:59:44,266 --> 00:59:46,704
ASHLEY: This temple, I mean this--

1247
00:59:46,704 --> 00:59:47,971
ORION: (laughs) This temple goes to six.

1248
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:51,369
ASHLEY: Just this whole land in particular. I mean
there's a lot, there's a lot here, but--

1249
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:52,593
ORION: That is good, though.

1250
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:53,604
ASHLEY: Yes, good.

1251
00:59:53,604 --> 00:59:56,053
SAM: Do you need a moment? Do you need to sit
down? Do you need me to hold you?

1252
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:58,239
ASHLEY: I think I'm okay to keep going.

1253
00:59:58,239 --> 00:59:59,382
LAURA: All right.

1254
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:02,994
ASHLEY: But maybe later. We'll see. If I get a
little tired.

1255
01:00:02,994 --> 01:00:08,668
MATT: At which you feel a nudge at your side and
it's an armored elbow from Kima, saying, "If you

1256
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,436
"wouldn't mind holding off on the fraternizing in
the temple of Bahamut, I would really appreciate it."

1257
01:00:13,436 --> 01:00:14,891
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

1258
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:16,275
SAM: Message understood.

1259
01:00:16,275 --> 01:00:22,620
MATT: At which point Scalebearer Yonn is now at
the second set of double doors and he presents his

1260
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,130
holy symbol above his chest, it glows a second,
and what was originally just smooth stone doors, you

1261
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:31,858
see a divine glow and the symbol of Bahamut you
saw at the front of the temple appear for a

1262
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:37,865
moment, and then as it vanishes the two doors open
on their own into a central worship chamber. This

1263
01:00:37,865 --> 01:00:44,017
is a much larger domed room. It looks like it goes
up about 80 feet to the top of the ceiling, and

1264
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:50,376
the dome itself has what looks like an extremely
ancient, detailed drawing, like Sistine

1265
01:00:50,376 --> 01:00:57,535
Chapel-style, the tale of the entirety of
creation. You see all the elemental planes

1266
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:02,192
represented in the corners, the theoretical
corners, where corners would be in a domed room.

1267
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:09,970
You can see a crude representation of how all the
planes lay over each other, you can see the Astral

1268
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:14,200
Plane, you can see where the Nine Hells would
exist, and the Abyss itself, and in the center

1269
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:19,255
there's the Prime Material Plane, and across it
you see a giant image of the great platinum dragon

1270
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:23,792
Bahamut drawn in all of his glory, currently
snapping down on one of the throats of a

1271
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:29,098
multi-headed dragon. This other dragon, with five
different heads of five different chromatic

1272
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:32,867
colors, and this struggle between what you know to
be Bahamut and Tiamat.

1273
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:34,105
TRAVIS: Tiamat?

1274
01:01:34,105 --> 01:01:35,242
MATT: Tiamat.

1275
01:01:35,242 --> 01:01:36,604
LAURA: Is that the bad one?

1276
01:01:36,604 --> 01:01:37,873
MATT: You gather.

1277
01:01:37,873 --> 01:01:40,189
LIAM: That is the baddest one.

1278
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:42,688
LAURA: I mean, I know that because I know a lot
about dragons.

1279
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:43,695
MATT: Indeed.

1280
01:01:43,695 --> 01:01:49,518
MARISHA: Whoa. Do I see or learn anything about
the elemental planes that I didn't know before?

1281
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:51,583
MATT: Not from the artwork. It's very pretty.

1282
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,033
MARISHA: Ah, so pretty.

1283
01:01:53,033 --> 01:01:56,868
ORION: I take it all in and I'm reminded of one of
the museums at home.

1284
01:01:56,868 --> 01:02:02,458
MATT: And actually, you've seen this art piece in
a book. It's been a long time, but you know that

1285
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:07,893
this has been studied before and exists somewhere
in Draconia, the tome that talks about this exact

1286
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:08,778
temple.

1287
01:02:08,778 --> 01:02:09,861
TRAVIS: A book?

1288
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,316
MARISHA: We just made cave drawings, I don't--

1289
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:13,074
SAM: That's those square things.

1290
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:15,224
ORION: The square things with all the paper leaves
in them and squiggles.

1291
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:16,090
TRAVIS: Right.

1292
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,571
LAURA: Is Tiamat still alive? Is he still around?

1293
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:19,108
ORION: I read a lot of those. Can't put my finger
on it.

1294
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:21,954
MATT: At which point both Yonn and Kima and the
Scalebearers kind of turn to you with a look of--

1295
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:29,594
kind of understanding that you don't quite know,
but also the fear and the knowledge that-- they

1296
01:02:29,594 --> 01:02:32,515
don't say anything, they just give you a look that
says, yes, very much so.

1297
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:38,179
LAURA: Oh. I mean. (nervous laugh) Tiamat's still
around, huh?

1298
01:02:38,179 --> 01:02:40,329
ORION: Unfortunately, yes.

1299
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:41,452
MATT: They continue walking.

1300
01:02:41,452 --> 01:02:42,260
LAURA: Oh.

1301
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:49,277
MATT: Now, the floor of this chamber, which is a
very simple stone, you can see there are small

1302
01:02:49,277 --> 01:02:56,082
sculptures, each one representing some sort of a
humanoid entity dressed in similar robes to the

1303
01:02:56,082 --> 01:03:01,429
other envoys and members of this temple that
you've encountered thus far. Some of them are in

1304
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:05,960
full armor, some are wearing just robes, and
they're very, very old. Some of them seem a little

1305
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:11,151
more recent, and you gather these each have some
sort of cultural or religious significance to this

1306
01:03:11,151 --> 01:03:16,568
temple. However, one of these is not a statue. In
the center of this worship chamber, which is

1307
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:24,536
strangely, eerily quiet, there is one humanoid
that turns to the rest of you. What you see before

1308
01:03:24,536 --> 01:03:34,274
you is a slender, elven male draped in long, white
robes that drag a few feet behind his form across

1309
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:44,413
the ground. He has jet-- not jet, stark-white hair
that is slicked back against his head, no facial

1310
01:03:44,413 --> 01:03:53,577
hair, frail but very handsome features. Elves,
when they age, they age very gracefully--

1311
01:03:53,577 --> 01:03:55,090
LAURA: Yeah we do.

1312
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:56,434
MARISHA: Yeah.

1313
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:59,001
MATT: -- and from the look of most elves you've
seen, this is a very old elf that has aged very

1314
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:08,099
gracefully. He turns to the rest of you and you
see across his neck a very, very well-crafted,

1315
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:16,608
intricate series of draconic symbols that finishes
with a giant emblem of Bahamut himself. His voice

1316
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:21,289
rings out and echoes throughout the hallway as you
approach, each footstep echoing as you get closer.

1317
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:30,577
"Welcome, everyone, to the Platinum Sanctuary. I
am called Highbearer Vord."

1318
01:04:30,577 --> 01:04:32,876
LAURA: Oh, right.

1319
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:39,047
MATT: "Keeper of this most holy of places. I
received word from a disciple of mine--" At which

1320
01:04:39,047 --> 01:04:47,220
Kima has now stepped forward, and bows, kneels
before him and says, "Your holiness." At which he

1321
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:53,222
looks down with a smile. "Ah, Kima. I am pleased
to see you. It has been a long time, my disciple."

1322
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:59,573
He looks up to the rest of the group. "I
understand you carry something of terrible omen.

1323
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:07,083
"Let us discuss how to be rid of it. Please.
Present the container."

1324
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:08,571
LAURA: Right here?

1325
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:13,970
MATT: The Scalebearers step forward and set the
container on the ground. They go to reach for it

1326
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:19,279
and he goes, "No no no. Do not open it." And he
kind of takes a second and holds his symbol to his

1327
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:23,361
chest and closes his eyes, and you can see this
kind of divine glow pulse off

1328
01:05:23,361 --> 01:05:24,658
of him for a second.

1329
01:05:24,658 --> 01:05:25,990
MARISHA: Kima, what's happening?

1330
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,182
MATT: She goes, "Shh, shh."

1331
01:05:27,182 --> 01:05:28,292
MARISHA: Okay.

1332
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:33,659
MATT: The box begins to pulse with the divine
light as well, and then suddenly vanishes and he

1333
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:43,652
kind of (gasps) catches his breath. "It is as you
said. This must be sealed immediately."

1334
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:44,659
ORION: Well, yes.

1335
01:05:44,659 --> 01:05:46,958
MARISHA: Yeah-huh. We could have just told you
that.

1336
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:51,348
MATT: He gives a look to the rest of the group
here, and you can see there's a noticeable bead of

1337
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:58,444
sweat he kind of wipes off his forehead. "I just
needed to confirm that this was not some

1338
01:05:58,507 --> 01:06:06,827
"haphazardly constructed fake or some other
artifact mistaken for such a horn, but we indeed

1339
01:06:06,983 --> 01:06:09,962
"have within our presence one of the Horns of
Orcus, and this does not bode well."

1340
01:06:09,962 --> 01:06:11,559
LAURA: (whistles)

1341
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:12,566
MATT: "Thankfully--"

1342
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:13,797
LAURA: Are you guys-- oh, sorry.

1343
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:15,166
MATT: "No, please. What do you want to say?"

1344
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:18,424
LAURA: I was just wondering. You've had one of
these before, yes?

1345
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:25,816
MATT: "No, but we know that these exist. A few of
us do; the knowledge itself has been lost to time

1346
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:36,902
"intentionally. It was brought to my attention, and
through discussions with the Council that sent you

1347
01:06:36,902 --> 01:06:42,824
"on this journey, that this would be the safest
place to seal such an artifact, and amongst all

1348
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:52,047
"our other options, as of this time, I see no other
choice. So. What's been proposed. Allow me to

1349
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:58,009
"explain to you the plan. One of our most divine
relics of our most beloved protector Bahamut was

1350
01:06:58,009 --> 01:07:08,420
"kept deep beneath this temple, within the mountain
we rest against. The Star of Exaltation, a crystal

1351
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:14,542
"born from the tear Bahamut shed for the sacrifices
his first devoted made in the Great War of the

1352
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:22,215
"Beginnings, the Dawn War. This item was
unfortunately lost nearly 300 years ago, giving

1353
01:07:22,215 --> 01:07:27,828
"the last of its power to protect this very
Vasselheim. The intervention it brought from our

01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:36,935
"great deity expended and left the artifact
destroyed. Since the chamber that held this Star,

1355
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:44,263
"a blessed and ever-watched nexus beneath the gaze
of the Great Platinum Dragon Himself, has gone

1356
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:51,877
"empty, we've tended to it. We've kept it fairly
well-watched and in the state it was originally

1357
01:07:51,877 --> 01:08:00,362
"constructed for. And we think no greater location
to seal such a deeply-rooted evil exists within

1358
01:08:00,362 --> 01:08:09,226
"our spheres of influence or any other.
Unfortunately, the last time the chamber was

1359
01:08:09,226 --> 01:08:17,074
"cleansed and prepared was some 15 years ago.
Our curate tasked one of our own Scalebearers--"

1360
01:08:17,074 --> 01:08:24,281
And he looks over towards Yonn, who sheepishly
backs away. "-- was tasked with preparing it for

1361
01:08:24,281 --> 01:08:34,899
"your arrival, and the artifact's, and it was found
that the lower chambers have been infested with

1362
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:38,442
"some manner of foul subterranean spider
creature."

1363
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:40,014
MARISHA: Oh, man.

1364
01:08:40,014 --> 01:08:47,418
MATT: "Our Scalebearer fled." At which point Yonn
leaves the entire conversation and exits the room.

1365
01:08:47,418 --> 01:08:48,471
ASHLEY: (quietly) Excuse me.

1366
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:49,579
SAM: Yonn.

1367
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:52,060
MATT: You hear Kima kind of give a spit in his
direction.

1368
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:58,436
MATT: "But not before initiating the vault's
defenses."

1369
01:08:58,637 --> 01:09:08,229
(sighs) "So thus, I ask you to complete your
journey into the Hall of the Exalt below, clear

1370
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:14,730
"out these meager beasts, and guide your reliquary
into the vault chamber to seal it for good."

1371
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:17,564
ORION: Will we have to contend with the defense
systems as well?

1372
01:09:17,564 --> 01:09:23,667
MATT: "Not all of them, but apparently in his
haste to escape and defend himself, he set a few

1373
01:09:23,716 --> 01:09:26,617
of them to aid his escape."

1374
01:09:26,617 --> 01:09:28,567
LAURA: Great. (shouts) Good job, Yonn!

1375
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:29,927
MARISHA: Thanks, Yonn.

1376
01:09:29,927 --> 01:09:31,413
MATT: You hear no response other than the
pitter-patter of steps.

1377
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:32,770
SAM: Why does he still work here?

1378
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,612
TRAVIS: (laughs) Right?

1379
01:09:34,612 --> 01:09:36,440
ORION: (laughs) Very good question.

1380
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,903
TALIESIN: Would you like to speak to his manager?

1381
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:39,768
SAM: Does he have tenure or something? Is it a
union thing?

1382
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:46,279
MATT: "He's been with us for many, many years, and
he has great heart and devotion. Though addled may

1383
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:48,500
"be his mind, he does bring much to the temple."

1384
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,842
MARISHA: He has seniority.

1385
01:09:49,842 --> 01:09:50,821
SAM: All right.

1386
01:09:50,821 --> 01:09:54,984
MARISHA: So wait, you said you lost the Crystal of
Exaltation during the War of--

1387
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:58,583
MATT: "It was destroyed during a siege of the
city."

1388
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,156
MARISHA: During the War of what? Beginnings?

1389
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:01,782
MATT: "The War of the Beginnings."

1390
01:10:01,782 --> 01:10:02,907
MARISHA: The War of the Beginnings.

1391
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,069
TALIESIN: That was close.

1392
01:10:05,069 --> 01:10:08,376
MARISHA: And how long ago was this War of the
Beginnings?

1393
01:10:08,533 --> 01:10:11,258
MATT: "Well that, oh, I'm sorry. It was created in
the War of the Beginnings."

1394
01:10:11,258 --> 01:10:12,550
MARISHA: It was created then?

1395
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:15,902
MATT: "It was lost in a battle, a siege of the
city of Vasselheim 300 years ago."

1396
01:10:15,902 --> 01:10:17,220
LAURA: 300 years?

1397
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,665
MARISHA: Called what? During what war?

1398
01:10:18,665 --> 01:10:19,968
TALIESIN: The Siege of the Metal Champions.

1399
01:10:19,968 --> 01:10:21,402
MATT: "That had no particular name."

1400
01:10:21,402 --> 01:10:22,144
MARISHA: Oh.

1401
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:22,954
LAURA: Oh.

1402
01:10:22,954 --> 01:10:23,875
MARISHA: Just a siege.

1403
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:24,675
LAURA: It was just a thing?

1404
01:10:24,675 --> 01:10:25,644
MATT: "It was one of the sieges and there was--"

1405
01:10:25,644 --> 01:10:26,709
SAM: The Battle Where the Thing Was Lost.

1406
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:27,597
MATT: Yes. There it is.

1407
01:10:27,597 --> 01:10:28,347
ORION: Right.

1408
01:10:28,347 --> 01:10:29,387
(laughter)

1409
01:10:29,387 --> 01:10:35,687
LIAM: Vord. Hi. Question, please. We'll clear out
your basement, that's not a problem. I'd like to

1410
01:10:35,687 --> 01:10:43,525
understand how you plan to protect this horn, how
you plan to keep it out of the hands of entities

1411
01:10:43,525 --> 01:10:45,111
who would use it for ill--

1412
01:10:45,111 --> 01:10:49,115
LAURA: That big scary creature living out in the
woods. Sorry, brother.

1413
01:10:49,115 --> 01:10:50,741
LIAM: Then how-- that's fine.

1414
01:10:50,741 --> 01:10:53,442
MATT: He glances towards you and says, "Oh, that
is but one of many."

1415
01:10:53,442 --> 01:10:54,417
LAURA: Huh.

1416
01:10:54,417 --> 01:11:02,639
MATT: "Let it be known that this temple is
extremely well-guarded. It is continuously under

1417
01:11:02,639 --> 01:11:11,230
"the gaze of our patron deity and while some of the
defenses have been put in place for your arrival,

"if the entirety of the vault is triggered, there
is nothing that will make its way there

"unannounced."

1420
01:11:22,025 --> 01:11:24,082
TRAVIS: Good sell.

1421
01:11:24,082 --> 01:11:29,644
SAM: Are we to carry the box down as we journey
into the dungeons below, or are we to leave it

1422
01:11:29,644 --> 01:11:31,828
here while we go clear out the basement?

1423
01:11:31,828 --> 01:11:33,266
MATT: "The Scalebearers will bring it with you."

1424
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:34,165
SAM: Okay.

1425
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,311
MATT: "Keep them safe."

1426
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:38,906
SAM: Keep them safe? Oh. All right. We've got
enough to worry about keeping ourselves safe.

1427
01:11:38,906 --> 01:11:48,359
MARISHA: So just to get one thing clear, and I
mean no (clears throat) disrespect, but how was

1428
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:55,005
the crystal lost 300 years ago, if it was in this
chamber? So this chamber has been

1429
01:11:55,005 --> 01:11:56,241
broken into before?

1430
01:11:56,241 --> 01:12:03,698
MATT: "We can enter the chamber under very
specific circumstances. We, at the time, requested

1431
01:12:03,698 --> 01:12:09,442
"the use of the Star of Exaltation as a divine
focus--"

1432
01:12:09,442 --> 01:12:10,578
MARISHA: Oh.

1433
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:14,304
MATT: "-- a ritual that required the intervention
of Bahamut to keep the city safe."

1434
01:12:14,304 --> 01:12:17,839
MARISHA: Oh, so someone brought it out and then
was clumsy and lost it.

1435
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,013
LAURA: And then it was lost.

1436
01:12:19,013 --> 01:12:20,095
SAM: And you know what--

1437
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:22,337
MATT: "It wasn't clumsy and lost. It was used as a
focus in the ritual."

1438
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:23,051
MARISHA: Oh.

1439
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:28,859
MATT: "It was by the will of Bahamut Himself that
the Star no longer was required to exist on this plane."

1440
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:30,214
ORION: She gets it. She gets it.

1441
01:12:30,214 --> 01:12:31,254
MATT: "It served its purpose."

1442
01:12:31,254 --> 01:12:32,448
MARISHA: So it was destroyed.

1443
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:33,571
LAURA: Lost, as in--

1444
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:35,332
ORION: Like not around.

1445
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:38,419
MARISHA: You should change your verbage here.

1446
01:12:38,419 --> 01:12:40,568
TALIESIN: Charisma of ten, ladies and gentlemen.
Charisma of ten.

1447
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:45,525
LAURA: While everybody's been talking, can I have
used my Primeval Awareness to see within six miles

1448
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:47,264
if there's any dragons around us?

1449
01:12:47,264 --> 01:12:52,560
SAM: (sings) Primeval Awareness, yeah.

1450
01:12:52,560 --> 01:13:03,489
MATT: So you take a moment and kind of zone out
for a second. You do not sense any dragons in the

1451
01:13:03,489 --> 01:13:06,119
immediate vicinity of the six-mile radius of the
city, no.

1452
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:09,010
LAURA: Oh, okay. All right. That's all I wanted to
know.

1453
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:13,622
SAM: (sings) Primeval Awareness, over.

1454
01:13:13,775 --> 01:13:18,212
TRAVIS: Can we drop off this box, or what? I want
to go see the fire dancers.

1455
01:13:18,212 --> 01:13:20,016
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

1456
01:13:20,016 --> 01:13:24,261
LAURA: No, we need to go-- we also need to-- are
we going to do that now?

1457
01:13:24,261 --> 01:13:25,483
SAM: Let's just go.

1458
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:26,994
LAURA: Go clear out the basement?

1459
01:13:26,994 --> 01:13:28,282
SAM: Yeah, it's the morning, still. Okay? Let's
go.

1460
01:13:28,282 --> 01:13:29,438
ORION: Are we all potioned up, are we all--

1461
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,315
MARISHA: Yeah, we're good.

1462
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:31,184
ASHLEY: We're all healed.

1463
01:13:31,184 --> 01:13:31,872
ORION: We're good?

1464
01:13:31,872 --> 01:13:32,846
LAURA: Let's clear out the basement.

1465
01:13:32,846 --> 01:13:33,800
TRAVIS: There's nothing down there, right?

1466
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,952
LAURA: Yeah? I mean, you want us to do it now,
yeah?

1467
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,042
TALIESIN: I'm not-- I haven't been paying
attention.

1468
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:41,056
MATT: "Lest this artifact be left longer in the
open, which I would not be comfortable with."

1469
01:13:41,056 --> 01:13:42,161
LAURA: No, neither would I.

1470
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:43,744
MATT: "I would prefer this be taken care of
immediately."

1471
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:44,680
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll do it now.

1472
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,580
SAM: Let's go do it.

1473
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,543
TALIESIN: We've got a bear.

1474
01:13:46,543 --> 01:13:49,188
LAURA: I mean, obviously we want the Horn taken
care of, but--

1475
01:13:49,236 --> 01:13:50,606
TRAVIS: Here we go.

1476
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:52,630
LAURA: -- you know, we're taking care of a problem
for you, too.

1477
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,074
SAM: Oh, here it goes.

1478
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:54,934
TRAVIS: Here it comes.

1479
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:55,895
SAM: Here it goes.

1480
01:13:55,895 --> 01:13:56,825
ASHLEY: Get it, girl.

1481
01:13:56,825 --> 01:13:57,586
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

1482
01:13:57,586 --> 01:13:58,547
ASHLEY: Get it, girl. Get it.

1483
01:13:58,547 --> 01:14:00,129
LIAM: The holiest place on the map.

1484
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:01,091
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs)

1485
01:14:01,091 --> 01:14:02,274
LAURA: The holiest place?

1486
01:14:02,274 --> 01:14:03,653
SAM: Haggle with the pope.

1487
01:14:03,653 --> 01:14:05,388
TALIESIN: Shaking down the pope.

1488
01:14:05,388 --> 01:14:07,949
MATT: "You want a monetary reward--"

1489
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:09,492
LAURA: I was just wondering.

1490
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:11,013
MATT: "-- for your aid."

1491
01:14:11,175 --> 01:14:12,098
LAURA: I'm not asking.

1492
01:14:12,098 --> 01:14:17,991
MATT: "The temple can provide a sum of three
thousand gold pieces."

1493
01:14:17,991 --> 01:14:21,008
LAURA: Per party member, yes?

1494
01:14:21,008 --> 01:14:26,359
MATT: "Entirely. Three thousand gold pieces for
your trouble on this journey." At which Kima steps

1495
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:31,123
forward and says, "Highbearer, we do not need to
take money from--"

1496
01:14:31,123 --> 01:14:34,035
LAURA: We don't want money, of course not. I mean,
I--

1497
01:14:34,035 --> 01:14:38,079
SAM: But think of the good we could do with that
money, giving alms to the poor back home where we are.

1498
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:42,229
LAURA: Yes, spreading the word of Bahamut where we
go.

1499
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:43,833
ASHLEY: Are we going to return for it?

1500
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:51,467
SAM: We do a lot of charity work and it would be
well-received back home. (under his breath) In our Keep.

1501
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:54,249
MATT: You make a persuasion roll. You make a
deception roll.

1502
01:14:54,249 --> 01:14:55,268
SAM: Deception?

1503
01:14:55,268 --> 01:14:58,522
LAURA: It's not a deception, we really will--

1504
01:14:58,522 --> 01:14:59,988
TRAVIS: No, no. Only one of you.

1505
01:14:59,988 --> 01:15:01,254
MATT: (laughs) No, he won't.

1506
01:15:01,254 --> 01:15:04,002
TALIESIN: The ladies of the evening really, really
do need the money, apparently.

1507
01:15:04,002 --> 01:15:05,136
MARISHA: (laughs) No, he won't.

1508
01:15:05,136 --> 01:15:06,413
TRAVIS: What did you roll, Sam?

1509
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:07,161
SAM: A 30.

1510
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:07,836
ORION: (laughs)

1511
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,263
LAURA: Oh. That's really good because I rolled a
19. Wait!

1512
01:15:09,263 --> 01:15:09,961
MARISHA: A 30?

1513
01:15:09,961 --> 01:15:10,849
ASHLEY: No, you didn't.

1514
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:11,581
LAURA: Yeah, I did.

1515
01:15:11,581 --> 01:15:12,339
LIAM: Three-zero?

1516
01:15:12,339 --> 01:15:15,447
SAM: Three-zero! I have a +13 for deception.
(laughs)

1517
01:15:15,499 --> 01:15:16,456
TRAVIS: Really?

1518
01:15:16,456 --> 01:15:17,412
(laughter)

1519
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:18,514
TALIESIN: That explains so much.

1520
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,809
TRAVIS: We've got to get you deceiving more.

1521
01:15:19,809 --> 01:15:21,706
MARISHA: (laughs) We've got to get you deceiving
more.

1522
01:15:21,706 --> 01:15:24,857
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1523
01:15:24,857 --> 01:15:26,826
MARISHA: You should lie more. It's good.

1524
01:15:26,826 --> 01:15:28,707
TALIESIN: Lie to me, Pinocchio. Lie to me.

1525
01:15:28,707 --> 01:15:33,169
MATT: "Three thousand gold, at your disposal, to
bring about and to share in the prosperity of your

1526
01:15:33,169 --> 01:15:35,264
"people back home."

1527
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,363
SAM: Amen.

1528
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:37,648
(laughter)

1529
01:15:37,648 --> 01:15:39,795
MATT: "Once the artifact is delivered and
sealed."

1530
01:15:39,795 --> 01:15:47,598
SAM: From one holy man to another, I think we've
struck a deal. Let's go.

1531
01:15:47,598 --> 01:15:51,372
ORION: Burt Reynolds, you've done it again.

1532
01:15:51,372 --> 01:15:52,651
TRAVIS: Amen.

1533
01:15:52,651 --> 01:15:54,791
(laughter)

1534
01:15:54,791 --> 01:16:05,749
MATT: As you all turn, Kima goes, "I'll show you
to the vault room."

1535
01:16:05,749 --> 01:16:07,294
LAURA: Are you going to come with us, Kima?

1536
01:16:07,294 --> 01:16:08,406
MATT: "Yes, I'm coming with you."

1537
01:16:08,406 --> 01:16:09,435
LAURA: Oh, good.

1538
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:12,257
MATT: She glances over at you. (sarcastically)
"Shall we, holy man?"

1539
01:16:12,257 --> 01:16:14,387
(laughter)

1540
01:16:14,387 --> 01:16:16,605
SAM: Why yes, my sister, lead the way.

1541
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:17,832
MARISHA: Sister.

1542
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:19,615
(laughter)

1543
01:16:19,615 --> 01:16:23,709
MATT: As you guys are walking out of the chamber,
the doors close behind, she turns to you and says,

1544
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:29,562
"Is that why you were blessed with such a
temporarily swollen appendage before?"

1545
01:16:29,623 --> 01:16:32,067
SAM: I don't know how the lord works, it's
mysterious.

1546
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:36,506
(laughter)

1547
01:16:36,506 --> 01:16:42,325
MATT: "Let us be on our way." She kind of walks
off, flustered and frustrated. You guys are led

1548
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:48,383
down two layers. This actual temple recedes
further and further into the mountain, until

1549
01:16:48,383 --> 01:16:55,610
you're led into what seems to almost be a storage
basement. It's a very musty smell. It's old earth--

1550
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,925
ORION: It's dank down here.

1551
01:16:58,925 --> 01:17:06,922
MATT: Yeah, it kind of has that moldy scent to it.
There are five guards stationed in this storage

1552
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:13,067
vicinity, and as you approach, they all stand up.
They're all still wearing ceremonial armor, two of

1553
01:17:13,067 --> 01:17:16,131
which you can see are really well-armed, one with
a greatsword and one with a longsword at the side.

1554
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:22,069
They look pretty prestigious to be assigned to a
basement this terrible.

1555
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:23,516
LAURA: At ease, soldiers.

1556
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:26,976
MATT: "Of course, of course."

1557
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:34,217
MATT: And they step aside. Kima steps forward and
takes her holy symbol and removes it from around

1558
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:40,216
her neck. She looks at the wall for a second, then
places it into what you didn't see before was some

1559
01:17:40,216 --> 01:17:47,752
sort of a slight recess in the wood. It flashes
with divine energy, and suddenly the wood illusion

1560
01:17:47,752 --> 01:17:53,025
is dispelled and what you see before you is a
stone doorway that begins to slowly shift to the

1561
01:17:53,025 --> 01:17:55,524
side and open up into a staircase.

1562
01:17:55,524 --> 01:18:00,219
LAURA: Are we going to find any of these defenses
right away, or what?

1563
01:18:00,219 --> 01:18:06,168
MATT: Kima kind of gives you a look, shrugs, and,
"To be perfectly honest, I have not been within

1564
01:18:06,168 --> 01:18:07,367
"the vault."

1565
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:08,365
TALIESIN: Well.

1566
01:18:08,365 --> 01:18:09,517
ASHLEY: Okay.

1567
01:18:09,517 --> 01:18:11,971
MARISHA: Huh. Is there a blueprint somewhere?

1568
01:18:11,971 --> 01:18:14,625
TRAVIS: Liam, you're up. I mean, (clears throat)
Vax.

1569
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,883
SAM: I thought he was Vex.

1570
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:23,577
LIAM: Sorry, my communication earring was a little
low there. What was said?

1571
01:18:23,577 --> 01:18:25,729
LAURA: Check for some traps, brother.

1572
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:30,950
LIAM: You got it. You got it. I'm glad to get out
of upstairs, I mutter to my sister, because the

1573
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,976
decor up there was shit.

1574
01:18:32,976 --> 01:18:34,395
MARISHA: (laughs)

1575
01:18:34,438 --> 01:18:45,610
LIAM: That is... high. That was a 26.

1576
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:47,062
MATT: 26 for?

1577
01:18:47,062 --> 01:18:49,156
LAURA: Traps in the stairway.

1578
01:18:49,156 --> 01:18:50,362
LIAM: Just traps.

1579
01:18:50,362 --> 01:18:53,759
MATT: Perception for traps? All right. As you
slowly begin to descend the stairway, you keep an

1580
01:18:53,759 --> 01:18:57,761
eye out across the staircase itself and any of the
surrounding walls. The stonework here is also

1581
01:18:57,761 --> 01:19:03,164
extremely ancient, marking probably a similarity
to the most ancient of buildings you've seen in

1582
01:19:03,164 --> 01:19:12,103
this city. This subterranean structure is probably
one of the older parts of this temple. You don't

1583
01:19:12,103 --> 01:19:18,218
see anything trap-wise. The stairway eventually
comes to an end into a chamber about 50 feet by 50

1584
01:19:18,218 --> 01:19:21,568
feet. It's very, very low light. There appear to
be--

1585
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:22,947
ORION: Oh! Light!

1586
01:19:22,947 --> 01:19:28,255
MATT: Okay. The brief moment of light, before your
eyes can really focus in, there's a flash of light

1587
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:33,661
at the end of Tiberius's staff, and the room
actually gets harder to see. You see there is a

1588
01:19:33,661 --> 01:19:38,164
thick white mist that just kind of hangs in the
air throughout the entirety of this room.

1589
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:39,111
ORION: Oh! (fssh)

1590
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:40,712
MARISHA: It's like having your high-beams on when
it's foggy.

1591
01:19:40,712 --> 01:19:42,038
ORION: I de-cast Light.

1592
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:43,457
MATT: Okay. You dispel the Light.

1593
01:19:43,457 --> 01:19:45,161
ORION: What is all of this poppycock?

1594
01:19:45,161 --> 01:19:48,243
MATT: Your eyes adjust a little bit, and you can
see what looks like-- this room, for the most

1595
01:19:48,243 --> 01:19:52,412
part, doesn't have any sort of details. There are
a couple of sconces with low, flickering light

1596
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:56,115
that are embedded in the side of the walls of this
50 foot by 50 foot room. It's about 20 feet high.

1597
01:19:56,115 --> 01:20:01,119
MARISHA: I go ahead and I do a little Wind Gust
and I go, (blows air).

1598
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:02,067
MATT: Okay.

1599
01:20:02,067 --> 01:20:03,824
MARISHA: Down the hall, to clear out the fog.

1600
01:20:03,824 --> 01:20:05,505
MATT: Which spell is this?

1601
01:20:05,505 --> 01:20:07,248
MARISHA: Gust of Wind.

1602
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:13,490
MATT: Okay, so you cast Gust of Wind. The mist
that was filling this room blows out the other

1603
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:16,060
side and you can see, the room is a little more
visible now.

1604
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,368
ORION: Oh, very good. Light!

1605
01:20:17,368 --> 01:20:21,465
MATT: There's still a light mist on the sides, but
the center of the walkway is clear for a second.

1606
01:20:21,465 --> 01:20:25,945
You see now in the center of the room what were
initially just dark spots in the mist, there are

1607
01:20:25,945 --> 01:20:31,887
two pillars that are attached from ceiling to
floor, roughly about 20 feet apart from each

1608
01:20:31,887 --> 01:20:37,062
other, kind of in the center of each side of the
room. Each pillar is solid gray stone with what

1609
01:20:37,062 --> 01:20:43,771
looks like intricately carved small dragons almost
curling and wrapping around the statues. Each one

1610
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:48,198
of their heads kind of turned, mouth opened kind
of angrily in different directions.

1611
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:55,267
LAURA: Can I check for traps or see if there's
anything--

1612
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,686
TRAVIS: You should re-cast that.

1613
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:57,985
MATT: You guys, both of you guys make perception
checks.

1614
01:20:57,985 --> 01:20:58,893
LAURA: Yeah.

1615
01:20:58,893 --> 01:20:59,848
LIAM: That's a 19.

1616
01:20:59,848 --> 01:21:01,013
LAURA: Oh, he already rolled. Look at him.

1617
01:21:01,013 --> 01:21:01,913
LIAM: Yeah.

1618
01:21:01,913 --> 01:21:03,883
LAURA: Perception?

1619
01:21:03,883 --> 01:21:04,755
MATT: Mm-hm.

1620
01:21:04,755 --> 01:21:05,803
LAURA: 25.

1621
01:21:05,803 --> 01:21:19,045
MATT: So looking about, Liam-- Sorry, Vax. You
notice the base of each one of these pillars is

1622
01:21:19,045 --> 01:21:23,908
not flush with the floor. There is a slight gap,
meaning there is some sort of a rotation or a

1623
01:21:23,908 --> 01:21:25,353
pivot to these pillars.

1624
01:21:25,353 --> 01:21:26,441
LAURA: Hm.

1625
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:33,595
MATT: You notice that these mouths of the dragons
seem to be what's creating this white mist, and as

1626
01:21:33,595 --> 01:21:37,564
time progresses, the mist begins to refill up the
room rather quickly.

1627
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:43,716
LAURA: All right. Do I notice any-- does it seem--
Well, without touching it. Any kind of poisonous

1628
01:21:43,716 --> 01:21:45,826
in nature, anything like that?

1629
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:47,071
MATT: Looks like mist.

1630
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:48,547
ASHLEY: Should we run through?

1631
01:21:48,547 --> 01:21:52,873
ORION: While we're standing around, I'd like to
reassign the earrings to Vax, Grog, and Scanlan.

1632
01:21:52,873 --> 01:21:58,321
LAURA: I don't get one anymore? You're taking it
off of me right now?

1633
01:21:58,321 --> 01:22:00,705
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's giving it to me. (laughs)

1634
01:22:00,705 --> 01:22:04,747
ORION: Because we're always together, we're always
kind of in the back together, and they're always

1635
01:22:04,747 --> 01:22:06,890
kind of like up in the fray, so--

1636
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,369
TRAVIS: That's true, I do wander off easily.

1637
01:22:09,369 --> 01:22:10,750
SAM: Oh, is that you, Grog?

1638
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,044
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hi. I know.

1639
01:22:12,044 --> 01:22:14,655
ORION: She's always kind of like in the middle.
She's the wild card. He's always in the back with

1640
01:22:14,655 --> 01:22:17,086
us also because we're the ranged dudes.

1641
01:22:17,086 --> 01:22:18,243
LAURA: All right.

1642
01:22:18,243 --> 01:22:19,709
MARISHA: Wait, do I still have one?

1643
01:22:19,709 --> 01:22:23,471
TALIESIN: I'm putting down my mask, just in case
this is awful.

1644
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:26,852
MATT: Okay. You guys are still at the stairway.
The mist has now filled the room again in front of you.

1645
01:22:26,852 --> 01:22:30,949
LAURA: Ugh. Should we try breathing it and see
what happens?

1646
01:22:30,949 --> 01:22:31,893
SAM: Yeah, sure.

1647
01:22:31,893 --> 01:22:32,894
MARISHA: My Gust of Wind--

1648
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:34,231
LAURA: I just reach my arm into the mist and just
see--

1649
01:22:34,231 --> 01:22:38,910
MARISHA: My Gust of Wind lasts up to one minute,
by the way, so I can keep--

1650
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:41,594
LAURA: Oh, maybe we should just not touch the mist
and go straight through the room.

1651
01:22:41,594 --> 01:22:42,728
MARISHA: I'm just airbending.

1652
01:22:42,728 --> 01:22:44,370
MATT: Okay.

1653
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,989
TALIESIN: You've been wanting to say that.

1654
01:22:45,989 --> 01:22:47,860
LAURA: So you can blow it and we just walk
through?

1655
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:53,444
MATT: As this conversation has continued-- let's
say about 30 or 40 seconds has gone by in

1656
01:22:53,444 --> 01:22:56,799
transferring the earrings and the discussion, so
there's still a little bit of-- there is a clear

1657
01:22:56,799 --> 01:22:58,149
pathway in the center there.

1658
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:59,089
MARISHA: Not much time.

1659
01:22:59,089 --> 01:22:59,849
SAM: Let's go.

1660
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:00,403
LAURA: Should we go?

1661
01:23:00,403 --> 01:23:00,936
SAM: Let's go through.

1662
01:23:00,936 --> 01:23:01,800
LAURA: Let's go before it gets back.

1663
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,377
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1664
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,260
ASHLEY: I start running.

1665
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:03,866
TALIESIN: Yes, go, run.

1666
01:23:03,866 --> 01:23:04,690
LIAM: Hustle, hustle.

1667
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:05,441
LAURA: Go, go, go.

1668
01:23:05,441 --> 01:23:07,798
MATT: Okay. You all start running through. You're
running through with them and keeping

1669
01:23:07,798 --> 01:23:08,796
concentration on your spell.

1670
01:23:08,796 --> 01:23:09,859
ORION: Vax, check for traps!

1671
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,212
SAM: Vorak, Desona, come!

1672
01:23:11,212 --> 01:23:13,580
LAURA: I perception-checked the room. It didn't
seem like there was anything.

1673
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,745
ORION: Oh, are we good? Okay.

1674
01:23:14,745 --> 01:23:19,516
LIAM: I'm running ten feet ahead of everybody. I
rolled a big old one.

1675
01:23:19,516 --> 01:23:21,041
(laughter)

1676
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,111
SAM: He tripped.

1677
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:23,410
MATT: Okay.

1678
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,793
MARISHA: Wow.

1679
01:23:24,844 --> 01:23:32,137
MATT: You continue forward, and as you're rushing
through the group, not paying attention, you

1680
01:23:32,194 --> 01:23:38,387
gently hit the edge of the mist barrier with your
shoulder, as you're rushing to the side

1681
01:23:38,387 --> 01:23:42,077
instinctually to stealth along the wall. As your
shoulder breaks the mist--

1682
01:23:42,123 --> 01:23:43,434
LIAM: Bring it.

1683
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:50,089
MATT: All of the dragon mouths burst into bright
fiery flame and begin spinning rapidly in the

1684
01:23:50,089 --> 01:23:54,418
room. The people that are in the center running
through right now, which include Keyleth, Scanlan,

1685
01:23:54,418 --> 01:23:58,239
Tiberius, and Pike, all of you guys make dexterity
saving throws.

1686
01:23:58,239 --> 01:23:58,984
ASHLEY: What?!

1687
01:23:58,984 --> 01:23:59,787
SAM: Whoa!

1688
01:23:59,787 --> 01:24:00,682
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

1689
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:01,354
LAURA: Vax!

1690
01:24:01,354 --> 01:24:02,596
SAM: Way to go, Vax.

1691
01:24:02,596 --> 01:24:04,533
TALIESIN: Teacher, teacher, did I have time to
finish my book?

1692
01:24:04,533 --> 01:24:05,383
MATT: You have.

1693
01:24:05,383 --> 01:24:06,185
TALIESIN: Yes!

1694
01:24:06,185 --> 01:24:07,142
ASHLEY: Dexterity check?

1695
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:08,148
LIAM: You said dex save? Dex save?

1696
01:24:08,148 --> 01:24:09,426
MATT: Dex save, yes.

1697
01:24:09,426 --> 01:24:12,100
ORION: 18.

1698
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,391
MARISHA: It's all right.

1699
01:24:13,391 --> 01:24:14,255
MATT: 18?

1700
01:24:14,255 --> 01:24:15,319
ORION: Mm-hm.

1701
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:17,540
MATT: All right. Hmm. Scanlan?

1702
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,779
SAM: Oh! 13.

1703
01:24:18,779 --> 01:24:19,727
MATT: 13.

1704
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:21,224
ASHLEY: Three.

1705
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:22,103
MATT: All right.

1706
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:23,558
LIAM: 26.

1707
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,804
MATT: All right.

1708
01:24:24,804 --> 01:24:25,813
MARISHA: Also 13.

1709
01:24:25,813 --> 01:24:27,288
ASHLEY: But I'm short! I'm so short. They would--

1710
01:24:27,288 --> 01:24:28,329
LAURA: Super duper short.

1711
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:29,514
TRAVIS: Just going to hit you in the face.

1712
01:24:29,514 --> 01:24:30,625
ASHLEY: They would just flow right over me.

1713
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:35,772
MATT: Okay. As the flames just burst out
throughout the room, tearing into the air with

1714
01:24:35,772 --> 01:24:40,634
this reddish-white flame, both Vax and Tiberius
manage to try and dodge out of the way as best

1715
01:24:40,634 --> 01:24:44,733
they can, only receiving, each of them--

1716
01:24:44,733 --> 01:24:50,381
LAURA: Well, all Vax has to do is roll,
because he's already on the freaking ground.

1717
01:24:50,535 --> 01:24:52,419
MATT: 12 points of fire damage to each of you.

1718
01:24:52,419 --> 01:24:53,526
MARISHA: To who?

1719
01:24:53,526 --> 01:24:56,077
LIAM: Well, rogue with Uncanny Dodge, for a
successful save gets zero damage.

1720
01:24:56,077 --> 01:24:57,134
MATT: You take none.

1721
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,189
ORION: And I take half.

1722
01:24:58,189 --> 01:24:59,408
MATT: So you take zero damage, you take 12.

1723
01:24:59,408 --> 01:25:00,763
ORION: So I take half. Is it 24 total?

1724
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,300
MATT: No, 24 total. You take half.

1725
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,347
ORION: Oh.

1726
01:25:03,347 --> 01:25:04,355
MARISHA: The rest of us?

1727
01:25:04,355 --> 01:25:06,828
MATT: Scanlan, Keyleth, and Pike all take 24
points of fire damage.

1728
01:25:06,878 --> 01:25:07,612
SAM: Ugh.

1729
01:25:07,612 --> 01:25:08,738
ASHLEY: I got 24 points.

1730
01:25:08,738 --> 01:25:09,792
MARISHA: Ouch.

1731
01:25:09,792 --> 01:25:12,131
ORION: Oh! My robe.

1732
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:17,035
SAM: Ow. Are we still moving?

1733
01:25:17,035 --> 01:25:18,104
LIAM: Tuck and roll.

1734
01:25:18,104 --> 01:25:19,934
ORION: Are you getting used to your new foot,
Vax?

1735
01:25:19,934 --> 01:25:22,578
LIAM: I'm back!

1736
01:25:22,578 --> 01:25:29,297
MATT: You guys move through-- that's the four of
you guys. Percy, Grog, and Vex and Trinket are all

1737
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:34,876
behind, as they watch the flames burst out and
they all kind of stop their inertia, and now the

1738
01:25:34,876 --> 01:25:36,441
mist slowly fills up the room.

1739
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:37,523
TRAVIS: Whoa.

1740
01:25:37,523 --> 01:25:40,264
MATT: About the time that your spell wears off for
the first minute.

1741
01:25:40,264 --> 01:25:43,202
MARISHA: Okay. (weak chuckle) Let's move?

1742
01:25:43,202 --> 01:25:44,536
TRAVIS: It fills up the room?

1743
01:25:44,536 --> 01:25:45,631
LAURA: We're still in the room.

1744
01:25:45,631 --> 01:25:46,675
SAM: The three of us, you're still back.

1745
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:48,721
MATT: You guys are split right now, with the
bearers, the Scalebearers.

1746
01:25:48,721 --> 01:25:50,992
LAURA: Oh, they're coming with us, they're like
coming with us through the whole thing?

1747
01:25:50,992 --> 01:25:52,406
MATT: They're with you, yeah.

1748
01:25:52,406 --> 01:25:53,369
MARISHA: Wait, hang on.

1749
01:25:53,369 --> 01:25:56,761
LAURA: Keyleth, blow the smoke again. Blow the
mist away. If you can.

1750
01:25:56,761 --> 01:25:59,365
MARISHA: Burning another spell slot. All right,
here we go.

1751
01:25:59,365 --> 01:26:00,437
MATT: Oh, no.

1752
01:26:00,437 --> 01:26:02,857
ASHLEY: We run through it.

1753
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,114
LAURA: And now we run.

1754
01:26:04,114 --> 01:26:05,585
MARISHA: Oh, no. He doesn't care.

1755
01:26:05,585 --> 01:26:06,389
TRAVIS: He doesn't care.

1756
01:26:06,389 --> 01:26:07,790
TALIESIN: No, we walk gently through.

1757
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:11,793
MATT: Burning the second spell slot. (wind noise)
The mist clears itself. Now that you're aware of

1758
01:26:11,793 --> 01:26:15,522
what it does, you're very careful to direct it
towards the center and leave an open path. The

1759
01:26:15,522 --> 01:26:18,834
rest of you rush through, including the
Scalebearers, in the minute you have. The wind is

1760
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:22,174
blowing in your face from Keyleth's position. It's
kind of like stepping into the force of a

1761
01:26:22,174 --> 01:26:24,578
hurricane. You have to put your hand in front of
you to see--

1762
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:26,577
LAURA: (shouts) Your breath smells pretty good,
though, Keyleth.

1763
01:26:26,577 --> 01:26:29,362
MARISHA: Thanks, I tried to get a little of a sage
thing.

1764
01:26:29,362 --> 01:26:31,163
ASHLEY: Sagey rosemary?

1765
01:26:31,163 --> 01:26:32,277
TRAVIS: Very minty.

1766
01:26:32,277 --> 01:26:34,018
MARISHA: A little orange blossom. It's nice.

1767
01:26:34,018 --> 01:26:35,801
ORION: I'm going to Prestidigitate a tiny air
shield in front of me.

1768
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:37,962
LIAM: When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty--

1769
01:26:37,962 --> 01:26:40,509
MARISHA: It's also pure oxygen, so we could get a
little buzz.

1770
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:42,577
MATT: It's a very, very tiny shield. It protects
this much of your face.

1771
01:26:42,577 --> 01:26:43,615
ORION: That's what I'm doing.

1772
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,561
MATT: Your eyes are fine. The rest of your robes
are still (windblown cloth sounds).

1773
01:26:45,561 --> 01:26:46,681
ORION: Yeah.

1774
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:49,359
MATT: You guys all make your way across the room.
You then finish your spell and the mist

1775
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:53,471
immediately fills up and completely obfuscates
that room behind you once more.

1776
01:26:53,471 --> 01:26:54,784
SAM: One down!

1777
01:26:54,784 --> 01:26:56,611
MARISHA: We made it!

1778
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:59,514
SAM: 20 rooms to go.

1779
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:05,700
MATT: You're now in what is a ten-foot-wide
chamber for an additional-- a tunnel or hallway--

1780
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:10,106
for another 20 feet before it opens up into
another room, but there is no light source in

1781
01:27:10,106 --> 01:27:15,857
there whatsoever. You, with Light on your staff
again, you kind of step ahead to--

1782
01:27:15,857 --> 01:27:17,732
LAURA: Do you want to shoot an arrow in?

1783
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,095
ORION: Oh, would you like to see?

1784
01:27:19,095 --> 01:27:20,130
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it.

1785
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,711
ORION: Yeah, very good. Light.

1786
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:25,754
MATT: All right, so as Vex releases her arrow,
light bursts forth from the wooden shaft as it

1787
01:27:25,754 --> 01:27:30,108
arcs across the room. As it does, you can see the
room. As compared to the previous one that was

1788
01:27:30,108 --> 01:27:37,698
square in shape, this one is circular. It is
almost a cylinder in its design. Go ahead and make

1789
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:40,476
a perception check.

1790
01:27:40,476 --> 01:27:44,376
LAURA: 16.

1791
01:27:44,376 --> 01:27:46,046
MATT: Okay.

1792
01:27:46,046 --> 01:27:47,700
LIAM: 29.

1793
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,184
LAURA: He's better.

1794
01:27:49,184 --> 01:27:55,886
MATT: Okay. You notice that across this floor of
the circular room, there are these circles marked

1795
01:27:55,886 --> 01:27:58,480
across the entirety of the surface here.

1796
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:02,265
LAURA: Great. Those are probably traps.

1797
01:28:02,265 --> 01:28:04,383
TRAVIS: I bet those are fun.

1798
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:06,245
LAURA: Pressure plates, maybe?

1799
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:09,552
ORION: Okay, or sigils or-- maybe we have to
activate them or not activate them?

1800
01:28:09,552 --> 01:28:11,413
TRAVIS: I have darkvision, now with a range of 60
feet.

1801
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:13,635
SAM: Can we see to the other side of the room?

1802
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:14,580
MATT: Hm?

1803
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,699
SAM: Can we see all the way to the other side of
the room?

1804
01:28:16,907 --> 01:28:20,093
MATT: Opposite side, there is actually a much
larger opening and what looks to be another

1805
01:28:20,093 --> 01:28:24,957
staircase that descends. This one is 20 feet wide.
It's a very wide staircase from what you're used

1806
01:28:24,957 --> 01:28:26,699
to seeing, especially in these structures.

1807
01:28:26,699 --> 01:28:27,924
SAM: And I'm hoping there's no door.

1808
01:28:27,924 --> 01:28:30,459
MATT: No doorway. It's open. It just descends down
below. And the only way you can tell is that the

1809
01:28:30,459 --> 01:28:31,766
arrow arcs across--

1810
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:33,269
LIAM: Everybody stand back.

1811
01:28:33,269 --> 01:28:35,357
I'm going to click my Boots of Haste--

1812
01:28:35,577 --> 01:28:39,473
LAURA: What? Shouldn't we throw something onto one
of the pressure plates first and see what it does?

1813
01:28:39,525 --> 01:28:45,143
LIAM: Yeah, me. I'm going to click my Boots of
Haste, I'm going to run, I'm going to do a sort of

1814
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:53,202
a running roll, land on the closest circle and
wait for half a tick and then roll off of it.

1815
01:28:53,202 --> 01:28:54,469
LAURA: Are you kidding me?!

1816
01:28:54,469 --> 01:28:55,423
ORION: What are you doing?

1817
01:28:55,423 --> 01:28:56,504
TRAVIS: No, no, let him do it! Let him do it.

1818
01:28:56,504 --> 01:29:01,165
MATT: So as you guys are about to go, "Wait!", Vax is
already off. Clicks the boots. The arcane magic of

1819
01:29:01,165 --> 01:29:04,051
the Boots of Haste kick into his body. He leaps
forward. Make an acrobatics check.

1820
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:08,520
LIAM: Okay. 22.

1821
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,521
TRAVIS: I hope you get your eyebrows burned off.

1822
01:29:10,521 --> 01:29:14,594
MATT: All right. You leap forward. Your hand
touches the first circle in the room. As it does,

1823
01:29:14,594 --> 01:29:20,337
there's suddenly a large shift in the room. All of
a sudden, the hand which you had purchase on

1824
01:29:20,337 --> 01:29:25,125
slides out from underneath you. You catch yourself
on your feet, but now suddenly there's a loud

1825
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:31,034
grinding sound and the entire room seems to be
shifting, moving, spinning in its own right, and

1826
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:38,427
you instinctually feel something moving towards
you very quickly. Make a dexterity saving throw, Liam.

1827
01:29:38,427 --> 01:29:39,626
SAM: Oh, boy.

1828
01:29:39,626 --> 01:29:42,645
LAURA: Vax!

1829
01:29:42,645 --> 01:29:44,893
ORION: I click my earring. You're an idiot, Vax.

1830
01:29:44,893 --> 01:29:46,918
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck because that blew. And
that's a natural 20.

1831
01:29:46,968 --> 01:29:48,559
SAM AND MARISHA: Oh!

1832
01:29:48,559 --> 01:29:49,551
ASHLEY: Oh snap.

1833
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:50,653
ORION: Yeah, 20!

1834
01:29:50,653 --> 01:29:51,726
ASHLEY: Yeah, 20.

1835
01:29:51,726 --> 01:29:52,615
MARISHA: Yeah!

1836
01:29:52,615 --> 01:29:57,304
MATT: So. You barely manage to move out of the
way before that circular portion of the ground

1837
01:29:57,304 --> 01:30:02,981
skyrockets up like a pillar-- one very similar to
the one that you created for your spell-- slams

1838
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:09,320
into the ceiling with a heavy thud, retracts, and
continues again. In fact, looking around you, all

1839
01:30:09,521 --> 01:30:13,464
of them in the room are now, at different levels,
pistoning into the ceiling. (repeated crashing

1840
01:30:13,464 --> 01:30:19,483
rock noises) This entire room is slowly rotating
and there's just a series of pillars mashing into

1841
01:30:19,483 --> 01:30:20,779
the ceiling.

1842
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:22,627
MARISHA: Oh, it's like a mini-game.

1843
01:30:22,627 --> 01:30:25,069
MATT: You have to make an acrobatics check to try
and get through this now because you have very

1844
01:30:25,069 --> 01:30:26,298
little space to move.

1845
01:30:26,298 --> 01:30:27,710
LIAM: Okay.

1846
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,362
(laughter)

1847
01:30:29,362 --> 01:30:31,321
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck again.

1848
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:32,623
MATT: (laughs)

1849
01:30:32,623 --> 01:30:35,574
LIAM: That is 18.

1850
01:30:35,574 --> 01:30:42,465
MATT: 18. You manage to make your way halfway
across the room, dodging out of the way as these

1851
01:30:42,465 --> 01:30:46,853
pillars are slamming and retracting. Kind of use
the pattern of when they're pulling down from the

1852
01:30:46,853 --> 01:30:51,778
ceiling, but they're moving very fast. One of them
manages to catch you underneath your ankle. Go

1853
01:30:51,778 --> 01:30:54,536
ahead and make a dexterity saving throw again.

1854
01:30:54,536 --> 01:31:00,381
LIAM: That is 15.

1855
01:31:00,381 --> 01:31:03,455
MATT: 15. All right.

1856
01:31:03,455 --> 01:31:04,935
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

1857
01:31:04,935 --> 01:31:07,265
ASHLEY: You're going to hurt your foot again,
Vax.

1858
01:31:07,265 --> 01:31:10,460
MATT: It catches you, takes you off of your
balance, and it rockets you towards the ceiling.

1859
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:14,964
You manage to pull most of your body out of the
way in time, but it still catches the back of your

1860
01:31:14,964 --> 01:31:20,171
shoulder blade. You take 40 points of crushing
damage.

1861
01:31:20,171 --> 01:31:21,136
TRAVIS: Yes! (cackles)

1862
01:31:21,136 --> 01:31:22,644
SAM: Ohhh!

1863
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:23,658
MARISHA: Holy shit.

1864
01:31:23,658 --> 01:31:26,716
MATT: As you are slammed into the ceiling. And as
the pillar retracts, you roll off with a heavy

1865
01:31:26,716 --> 01:31:32,784
wheeze of pain. (groan) Catching onto your feet
again. Make one more acrobatics check.

1866
01:31:32,784 --> 01:31:35,779
MARISHA: Oh my god. If you get crushed to death--

1867
01:31:35,779 --> 01:31:38,079
TRAVIS: (laughs) On Skype.

1868
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:39,451
LIAM: That's a 23.

1869
01:31:39,451 --> 01:31:40,586
MATT: What was that?

1870
01:31:40,586 --> 01:31:41,784
TRAVIS: 23.

1871
01:31:41,784 --> 01:31:44,386
MATT: 23.

1872
01:31:44,386 --> 01:31:46,195
LIAM: I'm like an acrobatic cheetah. 23.

1873
01:31:46,195 --> 01:31:51,821
MATT: 23. You manage to-- in the severe pain
you're feeling, you can tell there's probably some

1874
01:31:51,821 --> 01:31:55,673
serious bruising in there and you probably broke a
couple of ribs, but you manage to just barely

1875
01:31:55,673 --> 01:31:59,591
dodge and leap out of the way, making your way
across the room to where the staircase descends,

1876
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:00,879
out of the immediate danger.

1877
01:32:00,879 --> 01:32:01,820
SAM: Ah.

1878
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:02,724
LAURA: Jeez.

1879
01:32:02,724 --> 01:32:05,949
MATT: The rest of you now are standing on the
opposite side of this room, which is currently a

1880
01:32:05,949 --> 01:32:08,058
rotating grinding mill.

1881
01:32:08,058 --> 01:32:09,683
TRAVIS: That was great.

1882
01:32:09,683 --> 01:32:13,939
LIAM: I'd like to check if there's any kind of
device or anything on this side--

1883
01:32:13,939 --> 01:32:19,632
ORION: Okay, hold on a second, Vax, just chill out
for a minute. We all just took a little damage

1884
01:32:19,632 --> 01:32:20,733
this last time.

1885
01:32:20,733 --> 01:32:22,243
LIAM: I'm just trying a perception check.

1886
01:32:22,243 --> 01:32:23,165
SAM: He's checking. He's checking.

1887
01:32:23,165 --> 01:32:24,254
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

1888
01:32:24,254 --> 01:32:25,206
MARISHA: For a lever or something.

1889
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:26,120
TRAVIS: For a switch.

1890
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:26,926
LIAM: 25.

1891
01:32:26,926 --> 01:32:27,871
SAM: 25.

1892
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:34,461
MATT: 25. You can see, in the ceiling, in the
very, very center of the room, precariously placed

1893
01:32:34,461 --> 01:32:39,778
right where one of the pillars in the center slams
into the ceiling, there appears to be a small

1894
01:32:39,778 --> 01:32:43,297
quarter-sized hole, gold piece-sized hole in the
ceiling.

1895
01:32:43,297 --> 01:32:44,529
ASHLEY: Yeah, come on, Vex.

1896
01:32:44,529 --> 01:32:46,916
TALIESIN: Race you for it.

1897
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:48,876
MATT: It's in the middle of the room.

1898
01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:50,819
In the ceiling, where--

1899
01:32:50,974 --> 01:32:53,923
LIAM: Is there a clear shot of it or is there
(bang bang bang) going on?

1900
01:32:53,923 --> 01:32:58,549
MATT: Oh, no, it's still going. The pillars are
still slamming into the roof. And that one hole

1901
01:32:58,549 --> 01:33:02,681
you see is right where one of the pillars slams
into the roof. You only see it intermittently when

1902
01:33:02,681 --> 01:33:03,904
the pillar retracts.

1903
01:33:03,904 --> 01:33:05,100
MARISHA: Go, sharpshooters, go.

1904
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,349
TALIESIN: You first, or me?

1905
01:33:06,349 --> 01:33:09,410
LAURA: Well, let's try this first because you
might just break it down completely.

1906
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:10,610
TALIESIN: Oh, very well.

1907
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,942
LAURA: You are much more powerful than I am,
Percy.

1908
01:33:12,942 --> 01:33:14,538
TRAVIS: Yeah, ladies first, perhaps.

1909
01:33:14,538 --> 01:33:15,599
TALIESIN: Ladies first.

1910
01:33:15,599 --> 01:33:17,690
LAURA: All right, can I try to shoot an arrow into
the little hole?

1911
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:23,369
MATT: You can. This is a hard shot because it's at
an angle now. We're talking, this is Robin

1912
01:33:23,369 --> 01:33:27,079
Hood-level split-the-arrow. Because you have to
hit it and then ricochet upward to see if it'll

1913
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:28,003
have any effect.

1914
01:33:28,003 --> 01:33:28,984
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise.

1915
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:30,071
TRAVIS: Well, get up there.

1916
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:31,405
MARISHA: I place my hands on her shoulders--

1917
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:32,399
TRAVIS: Can you inspire?

1918
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:33,553
SAM: I can inspire her.

1919
01:33:33,553 --> 01:33:35,445
MARISHA: And I give her Enhance Ability.

1920
01:33:35,445 --> 01:33:36,590
SAM: Ooh, Enhance Ability.

1921
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:37,942
LAURA: Okay, what does that mean?

1922
01:33:37,942 --> 01:33:41,979
MARISHA: You have advantage on-- oh, ability
checks. It's just ability checks.

1923
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:43,365
MATT: Ability checks. It's not going to help for
an attack.

1924
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:44,528
LAURA: This is, what, an attack?

1925
01:33:44,528 --> 01:33:45,376
MARISHA: Never mind.

1926
01:33:45,376 --> 01:33:46,490
MATT: This would be an attack.

1927
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:49,316
TRAVIS: I would like to offer my beard for a rub
of good luck.

1928
01:33:49,316 --> 01:33:53,363
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

1929
01:33:53,363 --> 01:33:56,206
MATT: As you offer the beard, it tears off.

1930
01:33:56,206 --> 01:33:57,093
TRAVIS: What?

1931
01:33:57,093 --> 01:33:58,047
ASHLEY: Oh, no!

1932
01:33:58,047 --> 01:33:59,409
TRAVIS: What did you do?!

1933
01:33:59,409 --> 01:34:03,614
LAURA: You know what, I'm going to tie this to the
arrow. It's going to give it really good luck.

1934
01:34:03,614 --> 01:34:05,699
SAM: That seems like it's aerodynamically--

1935
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:07,722
LAURA: I'm not actually going to tie it to the
arrow.

1936
01:34:07,771 --> 01:34:08,877
TALIESIN: Okay!

1937
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:10,616
LAURA: I'm just going to tuck it--

1938
01:34:10,616 --> 01:34:14,948
MATT: Mark in your inventory, you now have Fake
Grog Rope Beard.

1939
01:34:14,948 --> 01:34:17,959
TRAVIS: Is that a -1 to my confidence now?

1940
01:34:17,959 --> 01:34:20,773
MATT: (laughs) It will come into play.

1941
01:34:20,773 --> 01:34:23,053
TRAVIS: (cries)

1942
01:34:23,114 --> 01:34:27,501
ORION: So the goal is to shoot an arrow into
this-- like the Death Star?

1943
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,040
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

1944
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,054
LAURA: Yeah.

1945
01:34:30,054 --> 01:34:35,063
ORION: Okay, cool. As I see her ready, I'm
going to hold up my hand with my ring and point it

1946
01:34:35,227 --> 01:34:36,507
right at that hole.

1947
01:34:36,507 --> 01:34:37,439
MATT: To do--

1948
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:38,650
LAURA: So you can deflect it if I--

1949
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:39,510
ORION: I got your back.

1950
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:40,518
LAURA: All right, thanks, Tiberius.

1951
01:34:40,518 --> 01:34:41,413
ORION: Get it, Vex.

1952
01:34:41,413 --> 01:34:42,357
MATT: All right, and you're going to--

1953
01:34:42,357 --> 01:34:50,782
SAM: I'm going to inspire her. With inspiration.
I'll sing, (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that

1954
01:34:50,782 --> 01:34:54,548
hole! Your arrow is my destiny, yeah I said,

1955
01:34:54,548 --> 01:35:00,361
ALL: (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole!
(laughs)

1956
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:05,493
MATT: And with that, you feel your focus, you
wait, you breathe in, you breathe out, you breathe

1957
01:35:05,493 --> 01:35:08,331
in, you breathe out in pattern with the slamming
of the piston against the ceiling.

1958
01:35:08,331 --> 01:35:09,565
LAURA: Oh, I'm so nervous.

1959
01:35:09,565 --> 01:35:11,068
ASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it, you're going to do
it.

1960
01:35:11,068 --> 01:35:15,078
MATT: You let out all your breath and you hold,
hold, hold, waiting between heartbeats, and then

1961
01:35:15,078 --> 01:35:17,899
(twwt), release. Go ahead and make your attack
roll.

1962
01:35:17,899 --> 01:35:21,590
LAURA: I'm going to roll the fancy one we got last
week.

1963
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:23,239
LIAM: Get it, girl. Get it.

1964
01:35:23,239 --> 01:35:28,108
LAURA: All right. (laughs) Oh, no. Okay. I add my
attack bonus?

1965
01:35:28,108 --> 01:35:29,555
MATT: Yes, you do.

1966
01:35:29,555 --> 01:35:30,920
SAM: Plus an inspiration.

1967
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,949
LAURA: Plus an inspiration dice?

1968
01:35:31,949 --> 01:35:33,096
MATT: Plus a d10.

1969
01:35:33,096 --> 01:35:35,389
ORION: Oh, shit.

1970
01:35:35,389 --> 01:35:36,943
MARISHA: (whispering) It's so quiet.

1971
01:35:36,943 --> 01:35:38,342
ORION: I know.

1972
01:35:38,342 --> 01:35:43,584
LAURA: Oh, that's awesome! Okay. 35.

1973
01:35:43,584 --> 01:35:45,531
(yelling)

1974
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,666
TRAVIS: Good inspiration.

1975
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:52,767
MATT: As you release the arrow, you see the
pillars slamming. The pillar comes down just as

1976
01:35:52,767 --> 01:35:57,445
the arrow crests over it, past another pillar that
just barely manages to miss it by a segment.

1977
01:35:57,445 --> 01:35:59,687
ORION: I cast Telekinesis to swoop it up.
(whoosh)

1978
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:00,962
SAM: Oh, god.

1979
01:36:00,962 --> 01:36:02,066
ORION: Just to help and guide it.

1980
01:36:02,066 --> 01:36:03,402
ASHLEY: No, but it's already gone in.

1981
01:36:03,402 --> 01:36:04,350
TRAVIS: We don't need it! We don't need it!

1982
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:05,557
LAURA: Oh, let me just see if I got it first!

1983
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:06,921
LIAM: She rolled a 35, we don't need shit.

1984
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:09,519
ORION: It's going in there, anyway. I don't even
have to roll.

1985
01:36:09,519 --> 01:36:16,111
MATT: So. As the pillar pulls down, the arrow goes
cascading forward. Go ahead and make a d20 roll

1986
01:36:16,111 --> 01:36:18,476
with the +5 modifier.

1987
01:36:18,476 --> 01:36:21,396
ORION: Sweet. That's 17.

1988
01:36:21,396 --> 01:36:30,022
MATT: 17? Okay. So as the arrow makes its way, it
ricochets off the bottom edge of the actual hole

1989
01:36:30,022 --> 01:36:35,276
and immediately bends itself upward, the shaft
bending. As it begins to start heading up the

1990
01:36:35,276 --> 01:36:40,012
hole, there's a sudden force of arcane energy that
slams it even harder up into the top of this tiny

1991
01:36:40,012 --> 01:36:41,239
little slit.

1992
01:36:41,239 --> 01:36:42,325
TRAVIS: Yeah, good.

1993
01:36:42,325 --> 01:36:46,934
MATT: As it goes up there, you hear what sounds
like a splintering of wood and metal. Then you

1994
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:53,957
hear metal grinding. You start seeing bits and
chunks of grinding metal begin to pour out of the

1995
01:36:53,957 --> 01:36:57,688
hole and the pillars begin to (scraping stone).

1996
01:36:57,688 --> 01:36:58,628
LAURA: Hey.

1997
01:36:58,628 --> 01:36:59,564
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1998
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:00,712
TRAVIS: Nice shot!

1999
01:37:00,712 --> 01:37:01,726
ASHLEY: Yeah, Vex!

2000
01:37:01,726 --> 01:37:04,208
MATT: Eventually coming to a halt.

2001
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:06,062
MARISHA: A wrench in the machine.

2002
01:37:06,062 --> 01:37:07,161
TALIESIN: I could have done it.

2003
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:08,122
LAURA: You totally could have done that.

2004
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:09,651
TALIESIN: I could have made that shot.

2005
01:37:09,651 --> 01:37:10,698
SAM: Next room's yours.

2006
01:37:10,698 --> 01:37:12,299
TALIESIN: Yes, next room, next room's all mine.

2007
01:37:12,299 --> 01:37:13,674
ORION: That was one of those impossible things,
right?

2008
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:15,150
MATT: Pretty damn close to impossible.

2009
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:16,422
ORION: I knew it.

2010
01:37:16,422 --> 01:37:17,395
LAURA: Nice.

2011
01:37:17,395 --> 01:37:19,152
MARISHA: (laughs) Pretty damn close to
impossible.

2012
01:37:19,152 --> 01:37:22,613
SAM: All right, let's go across and heal our
rogue.

2013
01:37:22,613 --> 01:37:24,211
TRAVIS: Yeah, we walk across.

2014
01:37:24,211 --> 01:37:26,240
LAURA: Yeah, all right.

2015
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:31,152
LIAM: As they come to the other side, I clutch my
broken rib and injuredly hold a hand up and give a

2016
01:37:31,152 --> 01:37:34,623
half-assed high-five to my sister. (grunts)

2017
01:37:34,623 --> 01:37:36,636
LAURA: Good job getting slammed into the roof like
that.

2018
01:37:36,636 --> 01:37:37,743
LIAM: Yeah, you're welcome.

2019
01:37:37,743 --> 01:37:38,666
LAURA: Yeah.

2020
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:39,701
MATT: All right.

2021
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:44,306
MARISHA: So can we take a short rest to heal up
and then also a short rest to take a short rest in

2022
01:37:44,306 --> 01:37:45,463
real life?

2023
01:37:45,463 --> 01:37:48,957
MATT: You can. We're going to go ahead and stop
here. You're now taking a short rest.

2024
01:37:48,957 --> 01:37:50,014
LAURA: Okay.

2025
01:37:50,014 --> 01:37:54,925
MATT: You guys take a moment. If you want to go
ahead and heal up using any of your hit dice,

2026
01:37:54,925 --> 01:37:56,152
you're able to, Vax.

2027
01:37:56,152 --> 01:37:57,233
MARISHA: I'm going to do that.

2028
01:37:57,233 --> 01:37:58,242
SAM: Me, too.

2029
01:37:58,242 --> 01:38:01,983
MATT: And on that note, we're going to go ahead
and take our five-minute break here, guys.

2030
01:38:01,983 --> 01:38:02,805
TRAVIS: Cool.

2031
01:38:02,805 --> 01:38:03,601
SAM: Five.

2032
01:38:03,601 --> 01:38:05,909
MATT: While the party takes a short rest, we're
taking a five-minute rest. We've got to be done by

2033
01:38:05,909 --> 01:38:07,731
ten tonight with the stream, so.

2034
01:38:07,731 --> 01:38:08,685
SAM: Let's do it.

2035
01:38:08,685 --> 01:38:09,550
LAURA: Woo.

2036
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:10,470
MATT: So we're going to take a five-minute break.

2037
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:11,302
SAM: True five. True five.

2038
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,144
MATT: Orion, if you want to go ahead and come
over, we're going to go ahead and give you guys--

2039
01:38:13,144 --> 01:38:14,770
yes, sir?

2040
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,052
ZAC: Bring them on up.

2041
01:38:16,052 --> 01:38:19,345
MATT: Okay, yeah, so we're going to go ahead and
introduce our guests and give them an overview of

2042
01:38:19,345 --> 01:38:21,811
the charity that we have currently on the stream
tonight.

2043
01:38:21,811 --> 01:38:23,203
TRAVIS: That was great work, though.

2044
01:38:23,203 --> 01:38:24,114
LAURA: Yes.

2045
01:38:24,114 --> 01:38:25,387
MARISHA: Oh my god, I rolled two eights in a row.

2046
01:38:25,387 --> 01:38:26,088
TALIESIN: Nice!

2047
01:38:26,088 --> 01:38:26,827
MARISHA: That's awesome.

2048
01:38:26,827 --> 01:38:27,961
MATT: I'm going to pass this over to Orion.

2049
01:38:27,961 --> 01:38:28,754
ORION: Okay.

2050
01:38:28,754 --> 01:38:29,918
MATT: Come on over. Gonna enjoy my chickens.

2051
01:38:29,918 --> 01:38:31,098
SAM: Don't forget to go to Teespring and buy our
T-shirts.

2052
01:38:31,098 --> 01:38:32,839
LAURA: Oh, let-- no! We haven't even talked about
it at all!

2053
01:38:32,839 --> 01:38:34,483
MATT: Yes! By the way, our T-shirts are on
Teespring. We'll have six more days.

2054
01:38:34,483 --> 01:38:35,596
SAM: Six more days.

2055
01:38:35,596 --> 01:38:42,085
MARISHA: They also just went up on our website, on
critrole.com. So you can go to our website and

2056
01:38:42,085 --> 01:38:43,001
find the link.

2057
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:44,621
MATT: All right, guys, we'll see you in a little
bit. Meanwhile, take it away.

2058
01:38:44,621 --> 01:38:46,855
SAM: I'm going to tweet the Teespring link right
now.

2059
01:38:46,855 --> 01:38:48,320
ZAC: Lucas, go fullscreen.

2060
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,753
MARISHA: Sam is tweeting it.

2061
01:38:49,753 --> 01:38:51,717
ORION: Give me that chair.

2062
01:38:51,781 --> 01:38:54,892
ZAC: Cool. Are you good, man?

2063
01:38:54,892 --> 01:38:55,923
ORION: Yeah.

2064
01:38:55,923 --> 01:38:57,230
ZAC: Sweet.

2065
01:38:57,230 --> 01:39:00,782
ORION: We had points. We had points. Are we
standing for this?

2066
01:39:00,782 --> 01:39:02,487
TAYLOR: Yeah.

2067
01:39:02,487 --> 01:39:12,075
ORION: Tell me that for the chat thing. Hi,
everybody! Orion Acaba here and Taylor Carol. This

2068
01:39:12,075 --> 01:39:19,070
is our special guest. And he's with GameChanger,
and he has a couple of things to say for this

2069
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:24,781
particular awesome charity that we are working
with today with SquareEnix and the Deus Ex

2070
01:39:24,797 --> 01:39:25,730
anniversary.

2071
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:26,646
TAYLOR: Yeah.

2072
01:39:26,646 --> 01:39:29,023
MARISHA: Taylor!

2073
01:39:29,023 --> 01:39:32,826
TAYLOR: Well, first of all, on behalf of
GameChanger, I just want to say what a blast it is

2074
01:39:32,826 --> 01:39:38,393
to be with you guys. Personally, I've never
watched D&D before. You guys have made me a huge fan.

2075
01:39:38,393 --> 01:39:39,785
ORION: Yes.

2076
01:39:39,785 --> 01:39:45,812
TAYLOR: And, yeah. So a little bit of backstory
about GameChanger. About nine years ago, I was

2077
01:39:45,812 --> 01:39:51,462
diagnosed terminal form of cancer. I was given
about two weeks left to live, but thankfully it's

2078
01:39:51,462 --> 01:39:54,061
been a long two weeks. I'm totally healthy now.

2079
01:39:54,061 --> 01:39:56,803
(cheers)

2080
01:39:56,803 --> 01:40:02,976
TAYLOR: Thank you. But when I was sick, the most
incredible thing that I saw was the impact that

2081
01:40:02,976 --> 01:40:07,434
video games had on the people and on the children
that were fighting cancer and other rare diseases.

2082
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:14,614
And witnessing the incredible good of the game
community of video games. My dad and I resolved to

2083
01:40:14,614 --> 01:40:20,617
make an organization that used and capitalized on that
incredible good of the video games, of the

2084
01:40:20,776 --> 01:40:26,106
gaming community, to help those suffering from
rare diseases. And so one year later, GameChanger

2085
01:40:26,304 --> 01:40:31,849
charity was born, and we started out just
collecting games from the incredible gaming

2086
01:40:31,849 --> 01:40:37,696
community, giving them back to kids suffering from
rare diseases. And seven years later it evolved

2087
01:40:37,696 --> 01:40:44,184
into what we have now. Now we're sponsored with
some incredible gaming organizations like Square.

2088
01:40:44,184 --> 01:40:52,275
A huge thanks to them for partnering with us for
this awesome campaign. But yeah, today we go into

2089
01:40:52,275 --> 01:40:58,289
hospitals and do things called GameChanger days
where we go and we bring food for the staff, for

2090
01:40:58,289 --> 01:41:03,377
the families, for the kids suffering from rare
diseases. We bring them gaming packages so they

2091
01:41:03,377 --> 01:41:07,854
can bond together. We provide college
scholarships, and we really just try and provide

2092
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:15,748
hope and inspiration-- the same hope and
inspiration that games really provided me when I

2093
01:41:15,748 --> 01:41:17,010
was sick.

2094
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:20,411
ORION: Yeah. That's awesome. And we here at--

2095
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:22,698
TAYLOR: Oh, thank you. No, thank you guys.

2096
01:41:22,698 --> 01:41:27,627
ORION: And we here at Critical Role really love
organizations like yours, which is why when we

2097
01:41:27,627 --> 01:41:31,772
started talking, it was such a nice partnership
for you to come on and tell us about this

2098
01:41:31,772 --> 01:41:38,947
organization. Tell everybody where they can find
to help, if they wanted to send to GameChanger.

2099
01:41:38,947 --> 01:41:40,855
TAYLOR: Yeah, GameChanger. Yeah.

2100
01:41:40,855 --> 01:41:43,071
ORION: Yeah, where would they go for that, to
check it out?

2101
01:41:43,071 --> 01:41:46,716
TAYLOR: To support GameChanger, to learn more
about what we do, you can visit

2102
01:41:46,716 --> 01:41:54,616
www.gamechangercharity.org, and if you go to our
website, you can see our campaign with Deus Ex.

2103
01:41:54,616 --> 01:41:59,402
You can go online and if you donate anything more
than a dollar, you get a free copy, a director's cut--

2104
01:41:59,402 --> 01:42:03,806
ORION: Oh! Well, awesome. That's cool.
I'll probably do that too.

2105
01:42:03,806 --> 01:42:10,935
It sounds like it's pretty sweet. And I
want to thank you, the rest, with all of us. I'm

2106
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:19,972
doing this because I'm currently fighting cancer.
I have-- I don't have that bad of a trek to go

2107
01:42:19,972 --> 01:42:27,946
through, but it is very inconvenient and painful,
but hearing stories like you. I mean, you're

2108
01:42:27,946 --> 01:42:34,586
20. He has a beautiful singing voice. He's a
singer. And you're going to Harvard, is that

2109
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:35,586
what's going on?

2110
01:42:35,586 --> 01:42:36,896
TAYLOR: I am, yeah, I'm a rising junior.

2111
01:42:36,896 --> 01:42:38,403
ORION: Stupid doctors, they don't know shit.

2112
01:42:38,403 --> 01:42:49,349
But people like you inspire me, because up
until a few months ago, I didn't need any of that

2113
01:42:49,349 --> 01:42:54,316
kind of inspiration. So it's great, and your
organization's great, so we just wanted to thank

2114
01:42:54,316 --> 01:42:58,230
you for coming on and speaking with everybody and
letting everybody know, and we'll be working

2115
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:04,187
together in the future, too, and we'll be doing
lots of fun stuff, so yeah. Check these guys out, please.

2116
01:43:04,187 --> 01:43:05,343
LAURA: Donate, donate.

2117
01:43:05,343 --> 01:43:07,242
ASHLEY: What are you studying at Harvard?

2118
01:43:07,242 --> 01:43:08,715
TAYLOR: I am an English concentrator.

2119
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:09,992
ORION: Whoa.

2120
01:43:09,992 --> 01:43:10,939
MARISHA: Nice.

2121
01:43:10,939 --> 01:43:11,861
TAYLOR: Yeah, yeah.

2122
01:43:11,861 --> 01:43:12,973
LAURA: I don't even know what that means.

2123
01:43:12,973 --> 01:43:14,881
ORION: Hold on a second. Do you mean like you
concentrate on English?

2124
01:43:14,881 --> 01:43:16,738
TAYLOR: (English accent) English primarily.

2125
01:43:16,738 --> 01:43:19,182
ORION: Oh, very good. Okay, cool.

2126
01:43:19,182 --> 01:43:20,659
That's like my second language.

2127
01:43:20,659 --> 01:43:23,444
TAYLOR: You guys have to teach me better accents.
I love all of your accents.

2128
01:43:23,444 --> 01:43:29,741
ORION: (laughs) Any other questions for our guest,
guys?

2129
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:34,547
ZAC: I'd like to let everybody know, the mods all
have access to the GameChanger command in the

2130
01:43:34,547 --> 01:43:38,187
chatroom, so if you guys are watching and are not
in the chat, just join the chat really quick and

2131
01:43:38,187 --> 01:43:43,511
you guys will be able to get that link for the
donation link to get Deus Ex and anything over a

2132
01:43:43,511 --> 01:43:46,814
dollar and you get a copy of the game. We're going
to go ahead and let that run all the way

2133
01:43:46,814 --> 01:43:50,947
throughout the rebroadcast and throughout the
weekend, so mods, just keep spamming that

2134
01:43:50,947 --> 01:43:51,984
throughout the chat.

2135
01:43:51,984 --> 01:43:54,228
LAURA: So donations tonight are going to
GameChanger, yeah?

2136
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:55,276
ORION: Yeah.

2137
01:43:55,276 --> 01:44:01,528
ZAC: It's up to you guys whether or not you want
826LA to go to GameChanger because the link right

2138
01:44:01,528 --> 01:44:04,063
now just goes to Critical Role, so it's up to you
guys for where it goes from there.

2139
01:44:04,063 --> 01:44:05,044
ORION: So we can do that.

2140
01:44:05,044 --> 01:44:07,251
LAURA: Awesome. I think donations tonight will
definitely go to GameChanger, yeah.

2141
01:44:07,251 --> 01:44:09,190
ORION: Yeah, so that's what we'll do. Awesome!

2142
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:10,169
TAYLOR: Thank you all.

2143
01:44:10,169 --> 01:44:11,101
ORION: Right now. That's the decision.

2144
01:44:11,101 --> 01:44:11,915
TAYLOR: Go team.

2145
01:44:11,915 --> 01:44:12,842
MARISHA: Tell them it's the last day.

2146
01:44:12,842 --> 01:44:14,139
ORION: And this is our last day. Is that right?

2147
01:44:14,139 --> 01:44:15,927
TAYLOR: Yes, so this is the last day to get your
copy--

2148
01:44:15,927 --> 01:44:17,148
ORION: For the Deus Ex thing.

2149
01:44:17,148 --> 01:44:18,701
ZAC: Okay, then I will not let it run over the
weekend.

2150
01:44:18,701 --> 01:44:22,496
ORION: Yeah. But again, dude, thank you for coming
on.

2151
01:44:22,496 --> 01:44:23,607
TAYLOR: Hey, thank you.

2152
01:44:23,607 --> 01:44:27,548
ORION: And we'll break because I have to pee
really bad. But thank you so much.

2153
01:44:27,548 --> 01:44:29,019
TAYLOR: Thank you.

2154
01:44:29,019 --> 01:44:36,909
ZAC: So guys, just to be clear, all of your
donations tonight will go towards GameChanger, but

2155
01:44:36,909 --> 01:44:41,761
if you want a copy of the game, just go and donate
a dollar on the link that we have access to in the

2156
01:44:41,761 --> 01:44:45,674
chatroom. And just so you guys know, there will
not be time for them to read messages tonight

2157
01:44:45,674 --> 01:44:52,039
after the show. Lucas and I both have to catch a
flight, so sorry. We'll get to them next time.

2158
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:54,508
TAYLOR: Anything more than a dollar.

2159
01:44:54,508 --> 01:44:57,333
ZAC: Anything more than a dollar, to be clear.
Anything more than a dollar.

2160
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:59,486
ASHLEY: Go donate. Just do it!

2161
01:44:59,486 --> 01:45:03,910
ZAC: Listen to Ashley. We're also really close to
another giveaway, guys. If you guys subscribe, I

2162
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:09,461
think we're only like ten away from another
giveaway, a large giveaway, which is a signed

2163
01:45:09,461 --> 01:45:14,502
Player's Handbook and a signed photo of the cast.
And every 50 we'll do a giveaway until the show's

2164
01:45:14,502 --> 01:45:19,871
over tonight. We will not be going late, so just
keep in mind, guys, don't send Geek & Sundry

2165
01:45:19,871 --> 01:45:24,698
messages upset that your message wasn't read.
We'll get to it next time. We appreciate you guys

2166
01:45:24,698 --> 01:45:30,528
donating and Lucas, go ahead and go to drop cam.
Yeah, go drop cam.

2167
01:45:30,528 --> 01:56:09,616
[break]

2168
01:56:09,691 --> 01:56:10,753
MATT: Welcome back.

2169
01:56:10,753 --> 01:56:13,371
ZAC: I had a really quick announcement before we
get back into the game. The winner is Paula

2170
01:56:13,371 --> 01:56:15,131
Konito, so congratulations--

2171
01:56:15,131 --> 01:56:16,066
MARISHA: Paula Konito!

2172
01:56:16,066 --> 01:56:17,171
MATT: Paula Konito, congrats!

2173
01:56:17,171 --> 01:56:18,404
MARISHA: Paula Konito!

2174
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:21,457
ZAC: -- and I understand that we crashed their
website for donations--

2175
01:56:21,457 --> 01:56:22,679
MATT: (laughs)

2176
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:23,528
ASHLEY: What?

2177
01:56:23,528 --> 01:56:27,730
ZAC: So congratulations, guys, for crashing the
website, but what is not crashed is our donation

2178
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:32,705
link, so if you scroll down and click on the 826LA
link, all of the donations that are made tonight

2179
01:56:32,705 --> 01:56:34,747
they've said will go to GameChanger

2180
01:56:34,747 --> 01:56:37,440
LAURA: Yeah, the portion of the donations that
would normally go to 826LA tonight are going to go

2181
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,509
to GameChanger.

2182
01:56:38,509 --> 01:56:42,368
ZAC: So just scroll down on the channel page,
click on 826LA or the donate link that's being

2183
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:46,930
spammed in the chat room, and all of those
donations will go to GameChanger. And they let us

2184
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:51,113
know before they left, they just got 10,000 more
Deus Ex keys, so we will let that run throughout

2185
01:56:51,113 --> 01:56:52,063
the weekend.

2186
01:56:52,063 --> 01:56:52,975
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

2187
01:56:52,975 --> 01:56:53,937
LAURA: Oh, awesome.

2188
01:56:53,937 --> 01:56:54,897
ORION: Nice!

2189
01:56:54,897 --> 01:56:57,501
ZAC: So the mods will keep spamming that
throughout the weekend and you guys can donate

2190
01:56:57,557 --> 01:57:00,687
throughout the rebroadcast and things like that
for a one-dollar Deus Ex code.

2191
01:57:00,687 --> 01:57:01,720
LAURA: Anything over a dollar.

2192
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:02,750
ZAC: Anything over a dollar, yeah.

2193
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:03,693
MATT: That's so awesome.

2194
01:57:03,693 --> 01:57:04,940
ZAC: One-oh-one! Enjoy Deus Ex.

2195
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:06,062
MATT: Yeah! Thank you guys so much.

2196
01:57:06,062 --> 01:57:07,511
LAURA: It would be good if you donated more than
one dollar, if you want.

2197
01:57:07,511 --> 01:57:09,118
TALIESIN: It's still needed.

2198
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:10,839
MATT: The Critters are strong. The Critters are
legion.

2199
01:57:10,839 --> 01:57:11,798
TRAVIS: It is. They are.

2200
01:57:11,798 --> 01:57:12,841
MATT: It's amazing the things we can do.

2201
01:57:12,841 --> 01:57:14,287
ORION: It is on. YES.

2202
01:57:14,287 --> 01:57:15,742
TALIESIN: There are Critters in the walls.

2203
01:57:15,742 --> 01:57:16,800
MARISHA: They're in the god--

2204
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,714
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: -- damn walls!

2205
01:57:18,714 --> 01:57:20,279
TALIESIN: Thank you for being there with me on
that.

2206
01:57:20,279 --> 01:57:22,002
MATT: All righty, so! Back into the fray.

2207
01:57:22,002 --> 01:57:23,075
LAURA: Oh, god, okay.

2208
01:57:23,075 --> 01:57:27,844
MATT: You guys, after finishing your short rest,
healing up various wounds in that circumstance--

2209
01:57:27,844 --> 01:57:30,042
SAM: (plays note on flute)

2210
01:57:30,042 --> 01:57:31,835
(laughter)

2211
01:57:31,835 --> 01:57:34,910
MATT: You make your way, playing a fancy little
ditty on the flute. You make your way down this

2212
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:43,252
long, long staircase. You continue down for, I'd
say, probably a good hundred feet or so before you

2213
01:57:43,252 --> 01:57:49,990
start encountering, I'll say, a mild change in the
scenery, at least. What was normally just a musty

2214
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:55,505
hallway is becoming thicker and thicker coated
with large spiderwebs.

2215
01:57:55,505 --> 01:57:56,808
LAURA: Ugh.

2216
01:57:56,808 --> 01:57:57,966
TRAVIS: Awesome.

2217
01:57:57,966 --> 01:57:59,332
ORION: Everything's so sticky.

2218
01:57:59,332 --> 01:58:00,473
ASHLEY: Spiders!

2219
01:58:00,473 --> 01:58:04,811
MATT: You manage to push through and cut through,
but it gets to the point where it's just so matted

2220
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:09,935
you guys are having to bushwhack your way through
as if you had a machete.

2221
01:58:09,935 --> 01:58:12,085
TALIESIN: I'm not taking off my mask.

2222
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:18,445
TRAVIS: Can I turn to one of those (clears throat)
Scalebearers and ask if they've ever dealt with

2223
01:58:18,445 --> 01:58:21,127
any umber-hulks in this region.

2224
01:58:21,127 --> 01:58:30,382
MATT: Scalebearer Vorak gives kind of a curious
look to your question. Scalebearer Desona looks to

2225
01:58:30,382 --> 01:58:38,068
you and says, "No, I don't believe they exist in
this region. Nor this close to the surface, as far

2226
01:58:38,068 --> 01:58:39,543
"as I know."

2227
01:58:39,543 --> 01:58:42,648
TRAVIS: Right. That's important, isn't it.

2228
01:58:42,648 --> 01:58:47,656
ORION: Are the spiderwebs-- are they becoming more
as we traverse--

2229
01:58:47,656 --> 01:58:49,056
MATT: Yes, they're getting thicker and thicker.

2230
01:58:49,056 --> 01:58:52,339
ORION: Okay, so I'm going to make my way towards
the front of the group because I'm noticing this

2231
01:58:52,339 --> 01:59:00,270
and I'm going to do a Fire Breath, and I'm going
to instantly cast Control Flame and catch as much

2232
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:03,590
as I can of it, and start spinning it, burning the
webs as we go.

2233
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:11,154
MATT: Okay. Very cool. So, Tiberius steps forward
and breathes a heating breath of dragon fire out

2234
01:59:11,154 --> 01:59:17,157
of his mouth. As it cascades forward, burning
through the nearby webs, he casts a secondary

2235
01:59:17,157 --> 01:59:21,859
spell and captures it and begins to shape it,
almost like it's a fiery clay in the middle of the

2236
01:59:21,859 --> 01:59:26,283
air. And he utilizes it in a very similar way to
how he uses Telekinesis and begins to use that

2237
01:59:26,283 --> 01:59:29,684
rolling fire to burn through the webbing as you
guys continue down the stairway.

2238
01:59:29,738 --> 01:59:30,471
LAURA: Nice.

2239
01:59:30,471 --> 01:59:31,748
TALIESIN: That's convenient.

2240
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:33,161
MARISHA: At least it'll be disinfected.

2241
01:59:33,161 --> 01:59:34,974
ORION: Mm-hm-hm. Fire cleans all.

2242
01:59:34,974 --> 01:59:40,722
MATT: It also leaves a terrible stench. Burning
web has this awful kind of--

2243
01:59:40,777 --> 01:59:42,157
TRAVIS: Burnt hair?

2244
01:59:42,157 --> 01:59:46,793
MATT: It's similar. Burnt hair with burnt plastic,
if you can think of it-- it's awful.

2245
01:59:46,793 --> 01:59:48,850
LAURA: What's plastic?

2246
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:53,520
MATT: This is more for your own player knowledge,
sensory knowledge.

2247
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,077
(laughter)

2248
01:59:56,077 --> 02:00:00,678
MATT: The sound of crackling of the nearby webbing
that's slowly retracting and burning and melting

2249
02:00:00,678 --> 02:00:05,907
is immediately joined by the sound of a low
clicking.

2250
02:00:06,065 --> 02:00:08,731
(groaning)

2251
02:00:08,731 --> 02:00:10,921
LAURA: I stealth immediately.

2252
02:00:10,921 --> 02:00:16,513
MARISHA: Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we-- I can
try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if

2253
02:00:16,513 --> 02:00:18,031
we want to sneak through here.

2254
02:00:18,031 --> 02:00:19,168
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that would be good!

2255
02:00:19,168 --> 02:00:20,267
MARISHA: Do you want to try to sneak through?

2256
02:00:20,267 --> 02:00:21,056
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

2257
02:00:21,056 --> 02:00:22,419
MARISHA: I cast Pass Without a Trace.

2258
02:00:22,419 --> 02:00:23,758
TRAVIS: Now let's vogue.

2259
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:26,294
This changes every time!

2260
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:27,486
ORION: Sweet!

2261
02:00:27,486 --> 02:00:30,577
MATT: All right, so Pass Without a Trace is cast,
while you two both make stealth rolls.

2262
02:00:30,577 --> 02:00:32,103
LAURA: So, with the Pass Without a Trace?

2263
02:00:32,103 --> 02:00:33,232
MATT: With the Pass Without a Trace, yes.

2264
02:00:33,232 --> 02:00:34,361
LAURA: 31.

2265
02:00:34,361 --> 02:00:35,659
ORION: (quietly, to Marisha) Is my magic on
stealth, too?

2266
02:00:35,659 --> 02:00:36,585
LIAM: 24.

2267
02:00:36,585 --> 02:00:37,853
MATT: With the plus ten?

2268
02:00:37,853 --> 02:00:39,212
LIAM: Plus ten from what? Say again?

2269
02:00:39,212 --> 02:00:40,197
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace.

2270
02:00:40,197 --> 02:00:41,214
MATT: Keyleth cast Pass Without a Trace.

2271
02:00:41,214 --> 02:00:42,454
LIAM: Oh, 34.

2272
02:00:42,454 --> 02:00:47,559
MATT: All right. You guys dart off to the side,
kind of using the remnants of the web to block

2273
02:00:47,559 --> 02:00:55,902
your physical forms. The boiling fire that has
been placed ahead of you is starting to reflect

2274
02:00:55,902 --> 02:01:01,708
small little points of reflected light throughout
the shadows in the distance that are moving

2275
02:01:01,708 --> 02:01:06,647
towards you as you see giant hairy arachnid legs.

2276
02:01:06,647 --> 02:01:17,516
ORION: I back up! I have my cloak on. And I'm
going to go ahead and cast Stoneskin. That's what

2277
02:01:17,516 --> 02:01:19,185
I do right now.

2278
02:01:19,185 --> 02:01:22,626
MATT: You cast Stoneskin? I'm going to go
ahead and ask--

2279
02:01:22,626 --> 02:01:26,655
MARISHA: I'm also going to cast Stoneskin.

2280
02:01:26,706 --> 02:01:32,942
LAURA: Can I cast, while they're coming-- where
did I write it down?

2281
02:01:32,942 --> 02:01:35,156
SAM: I'm going to go invisible.

2282
02:01:35,156 --> 02:01:39,027
LAURA: Never mind, I can't find my spell.

2283
02:01:53,945 --> 02:01:57,481
SAM: This is exciting, guys. There's a board
of some sort.

2284
02:01:57,549 --> 02:02:00,548
LAURA: I cast Entangle on the ground.

2285
02:02:00,548 --> 02:02:02,383
MATT: In front?

2286
02:02:02,383 --> 02:02:03,835
LAURA: Yeah.

2287
02:02:03,835 --> 02:02:06,212
SAM: You have-- you can cast things?

2288
02:02:06,212 --> 02:02:07,446
LAURA: (quickly) Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2289
02:02:07,446 --> 02:02:09,465
ORION: (quietly) Yeah, she's a ranger, she can
cast stuff.

2290
02:02:09,465 --> 02:02:10,613
TRAVIS: Apparently.

2291
02:02:10,613 --> 02:02:12,077
TALIESIN: As long as it's at range.

2292
02:02:12,077 --> 02:02:13,462
SAM: Grog, you've got a beard spell.

2293
02:02:13,462 --> 02:02:14,451
TRAVIS: I do.

2294
02:02:14,451 --> 02:02:16,547
TALIESIN: That was my terrible joke and I wish I
hadn't. Now I'm embarrassed.

2295
02:02:16,547 --> 02:02:18,488
TRAVIS: I can also cast Flatulence.

2296
02:02:18,488 --> 02:02:21,997
SAM: And you have Frenzied Rage.

2297
02:02:22,047 --> 02:02:31,479
MATT: All right. You can now see skittering off to
the side what appear to be a series of large

2298
02:02:31,479 --> 02:02:36,364
arachnid-like creatures. As you cast Entanglement,
you can--

2299
02:02:36,364 --> 02:02:37,994
LAURA: I'm reading it now.

2300
02:02:37,994 --> 02:02:40,130
MATT: Go ahead and read the spell.

2301
02:02:40,297 --> 02:02:44,141
ORION: Did I manage to catch with the Control
Flame my entire Fire Breath when I did that? And

2302
02:02:44,141 --> 02:02:45,652
I'm controlling it still?

2303
02:02:45,652 --> 02:02:46,867
MATT: Currently you are.

2304
02:02:46,867 --> 02:02:49,952
LAURA: Oh, that's not what it was. That's the
wrong spell. Sorry, sorry, it's Spike Growth, is

2305
02:02:49,952 --> 02:02:51,125
the spell.

2306
02:02:51,125 --> 02:02:52,496
SAM: Spikes growth?

2307
02:02:52,496 --> 02:02:55,457
LAURA: I cast Spike Growth.

2308
02:02:55,457 --> 02:02:57,371
MATT: Spike Growth, okay, that is different.

2309
02:02:57,371 --> 02:03:03,521
LAURA: Yes, which is-- the ground in a 20-foot
radius centered on a point within range twists and

2310
02:03:03,521 --> 02:03:10,120
sprouts hard spikes and thorns. It's difficult
terrain for the duration, but anybody that can see

2311
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:14,895
me casting it doesn't take damage to it, it's only
the people that don't see me casting it.

2312
02:03:14,895 --> 02:03:16,349
MARISHA: Dope.

2313
02:03:16,349 --> 02:03:18,104
SAM: Really?

2314
02:03:18,104 --> 02:03:19,705
MATT: All right.

2315
02:03:19,705 --> 02:03:23,314
LAURA: Yeah. Any creature that can't see the area
at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check.

2316
02:03:23,314 --> 02:03:24,520
ORION: Cool.

2317
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:26,188
SAM: All right, but can they see the area?

2318
02:03:26,188 --> 02:03:28,329
MATT: They can see the area.

2319
02:03:28,329 --> 02:03:34,628
LAURA: Oh. Well, that's not quite the same thing,
then, what I saw. (yells) Forget it, my spell is stupid!

2320
02:03:34,628 --> 02:03:35,554
SAM: No, no!

2321
02:03:35,554 --> 02:03:36,812
ORION: It's fine, just not in a hallway with
stairs.

2322
02:03:36,812 --> 02:03:37,697
LAURA: I know!

2323
02:03:37,697 --> 02:03:39,558
SAM: It's fine, just stick to arrows, really.

2324
02:03:39,558 --> 02:03:43,853
ASHLEY: She can do so much more than just arrows!

2325
02:03:43,853 --> 02:03:49,208
ORION: As I see this, can I release my Control
Flame and let the Fire Breath just happen, and not

2326
02:03:49,208 --> 02:03:50,371
control it anymore?

2327
02:03:50,371 --> 02:03:56,708
MATT: Looking into your spell now. Oh, Control Flames
is a cantrip. You are able to control just enough

2328
02:03:56,879 --> 02:04:01,010
fire to burn away the things. It wouldn't actually
do any damage if released. Control Fire kind of

2329
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:03,014
like captures an element of it.

2330
02:04:03,014 --> 02:04:05,741
ORION: Okay. So that's what I was using, the
element of what I did.

2331
02:04:05,741 --> 02:04:06,596
MATT: Yeah.

2332
02:04:06,596 --> 02:04:07,832
ORION: So I used it so I could have the fire.

2333
02:04:07,832 --> 02:04:08,595
MATT: Exactly.

2334
02:04:08,595 --> 02:04:09,358
ORION: Got it.

2335
02:04:09,358 --> 02:04:11,169
MATT: You set it as a catalyst to it.

2336
02:04:11,169 --> 02:04:14,170
LAURA: They can see the ground.

2337
02:04:14,170 --> 02:04:16,019
MATT: They can.

2338
02:04:16,019 --> 02:04:18,472
LAURA: Then no, don't cast it.

2339
02:04:18,628 --> 02:04:20,705
TRAVIS: Doesn't it mess up the ground if we try to
walk through it?

2340
02:04:20,705 --> 02:04:22,068
LAURA: Not you guys, but they--

2341
02:04:22,068 --> 02:04:25,842
MARISHA: But they're spiders. They're probably not
that wise.

2342
02:04:25,842 --> 02:04:27,278
ORION: Can I cast something else?

2343
02:04:27,278 --> 02:04:28,438
MATT: No. Right now everyone rolls initiative.

2344
02:04:28,438 --> 02:04:29,581
ORION: Damn it!

2345
02:04:29,581 --> 02:04:31,588
ASHLEY: Ugh.

2346
02:04:31,588 --> 02:04:32,977
MATT: There are only so many things you can do
here, Tiberius.

2347
02:04:32,977 --> 02:04:34,447
ORION: I know, but I like doing lots of things.

2348
02:04:34,447 --> 02:04:35,375
MATT: I know you do.

2349
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:37,037
MARISHA: That's not bad! I'll take that.

2350
02:04:37,037 --> 02:04:38,099
SAM: I lost my dice.

2351
02:04:38,099 --> 02:04:38,990
LAURA: That's my punishment.

2352
02:04:38,990 --> 02:04:40,095
TRAVIS: Fuck, yeah.

2353
02:04:40,095 --> 02:04:41,239
TALIESIN: I love my new stats.

2354
02:04:41,239 --> 02:04:42,509
LAURA: I don't think that should count.

2355
02:04:42,509 --> 02:04:45,131
TALIESIN: I rolled terribly this time but my stats
are good.

2356
02:04:45,131 --> 02:04:46,585
SAM: Every time, every time.

2357
02:04:46,585 --> 02:04:48,000
ORION: What?

2358
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,709
SAM: I've never rolled a double digit initiative
roll, ever.

2359
02:04:51,709 --> 02:04:53,949
MATT: Oh, Scanlan, but you roll when it
counts.

2360
02:04:53,949 --> 02:04:56,733
TRAVIS: Just Wil Wheaton roll every time you do
initiative.

2361
02:04:56,786 --> 02:04:58,165
TALIESIN: Is that what we're calling it?
Wheatoning?

2362
02:04:58,165 --> 02:04:59,129
TRAVIS: Yeah, Wheatoning.

2363
02:04:59,129 --> 02:05:00,196
LAURA: Wheatoning? Yeah.

2364
02:05:00,196 --> 02:05:00,952
TALIESIN: All right.

2365
02:05:00,952 --> 02:05:01,840
TRAVIS: Wheatoning.

2366
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,419
SAM: (announcer voice) Wha-Wha-Wheaton.

2367
02:05:03,419 --> 02:05:04,692
MATT: All right, so. 25-20.

2368
02:05:04,692 --> 02:05:05,805
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

2369
02:05:05,805 --> 02:05:07,342
(yelling)

2370
02:05:07,342 --> 02:05:09,354
ASHLEY: I don't think that ever happens when it's
like damage or something.

2371
02:05:09,354 --> 02:05:10,684
MATT: That's okay.

2372
02:05:10,684 --> 02:05:11,777
LAURA: 23.

2373
02:05:11,777 --> 02:05:12,759
ASHLEY: I'm gonna go with it.

2374
02:05:12,759 --> 02:05:13,811
MATT: Okay, so 23. Grog, what have you got?

2375
02:05:13,811 --> 02:05:14,811
TRAVIS: 21.

2376
02:05:14,811 --> 02:05:22,469
MATT: Okay, so we've got Vex, Grog, and Pike,
what's your dex? What's your initiative bonus?

2377
02:05:22,469 --> 02:05:23,836
ASHLEY: Nothing.

2378
02:05:23,836 --> 02:05:26,906
MATT: Nothing, so 20. All right. 20 to 15?

2379
02:05:26,906 --> 02:05:28,116
MARISHA: 17.

2380
02:05:28,116 --> 02:05:29,322
MATT: 17, Keyleth.

2381
02:05:29,322 --> 02:05:30,269
ORION: 15.

2382
02:05:30,269 --> 02:05:31,345
TALIESIN: 16.

2383
02:05:31,345 --> 02:05:40,010
MATT: All right, Percy. Tiberius. Vax?

2384
02:05:40,010 --> 02:05:42,030
LAURA: He's gone.

2385
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:43,483
MATT: Has left the screen.

2386
02:05:43,483 --> 02:05:44,526
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

2387
02:05:44,526 --> 02:05:45,530
SAM: Great.

2388
02:05:45,530 --> 02:05:46,619
ASHLEY: Last.

2389
02:05:46,619 --> 02:05:48,070
MATT: I'm going to consider that a low
initiative.

2390
02:05:48,070 --> 02:05:49,195
MARISHA: Oh-ho-ho-ho.

2391
02:05:49,195 --> 02:05:50,306
ORION: He just went to go poop.

2392
02:05:50,306 --> 02:05:51,818
SAM: Seven!

2393
02:05:51,857 --> 02:05:53,097
MATT: Seven for Scanlan.

2394
02:05:53,097 --> 02:05:53,963
ORION: Or deal with--

2395
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:55,470
MATT: All right, we'll get to his turn when we get
to it.

2396
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:56,412
ASHLEY: (yells) Vax!

2397
02:05:56,412 --> 02:05:57,562
MATT: It's okay. All right, Vex.

2398
02:05:57,562 --> 02:05:58,529
MARISHA: Wait, there he is.

2399
02:05:58,529 --> 02:05:59,559
SAM: He's holding a cat.

2400
02:05:59,559 --> 02:06:01,214
ORION: He has a cat.

2401
02:06:01,277 --> 02:06:03,502
SAM: It's Trinket! It's Trinket!

2402
02:06:03,502 --> 02:06:05,446
MATT: What did you roll for initiative?

2403
02:06:05,446 --> 02:06:06,524
LIAM: That is a 16.

2404
02:06:06,524 --> 02:06:07,551
MATT: 16?

2405
02:06:07,551 --> 02:06:08,334
ORION: Okay.

2406
02:06:08,334 --> 02:06:09,676
TRAVIS: Get your head out of your ass.

2407
02:06:09,676 --> 02:06:10,899
SAM: He's Dr. Evil.

2408
02:06:10,899 --> 02:06:12,552
(laughter)

2409
02:06:12,552 --> 02:06:13,153
MATT: All right, Vex.

2410
02:06:13,153 --> 02:06:14,021
LAURA: Me?

2411
02:06:14,021 --> 02:06:15,327
MATT: Yes.

2412
02:06:15,393 --> 02:06:18,291
LAURA: Oh! I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at
all of the spiders coming at us.

2413
02:06:18,344 --> 02:06:20,186
MATT: All righty.

2414
02:06:20,186 --> 02:06:23,343
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark whatever one
looks the biggest.

2415
02:06:23,343 --> 02:06:26,693
MATT: Okay, from this position you will also hit
Tiberius to hit all the spiders.

2416
02:06:26,693 --> 02:06:27,585
LAURA: Oh, where am I?

2417
02:06:27,585 --> 02:06:28,947
MATT: You're right here.

2418
02:06:28,947 --> 02:06:30,443
LAURA: Oh.

2419
02:06:30,443 --> 02:06:34,418
TRAVIS: You gotta do what you gotta do. (laughs)
Sorry.

2420
02:06:34,418 --> 02:06:35,579
MATT: I mean, you could--

2421
02:06:35,579 --> 02:06:37,516
LAURA: I'm going to move to where I'm in the
middle of them. I'm still kind of stuck.

2422
02:06:37,516 --> 02:06:38,467
MATT: Right there?

2423
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:39,156
MARISHA: Get it!

2424
02:06:39,156 --> 02:06:40,317
LAURA: Yeah, and then I'll Conjure Barrage from
there.

2425
02:06:40,317 --> 02:06:40,953
MATT: Okay.

2426
02:06:40,953 --> 02:06:41,853
TRAVIS: (quietly) Don't encourage it.

2427
02:06:41,853 --> 02:06:43,333
LAURA: I cast Hunter's Mark on the biggest one I
see.

2428
02:06:43,333 --> 02:06:44,811
MATT: Okay, this one here is one of the larger
ones.

2429
02:06:44,811 --> 02:06:45,600
LAURA: Okay.

2430
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:50,805
MATT: So I'm going to go ahead and mark that one.
So go ahead and-- Conjure Barrage does what

2431
02:06:50,805 --> 02:06:51,860
damage?

2432
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:52,912
TRAVIS: (quietly) Hate it.

2433
02:06:52,912 --> 02:06:54,883
LAURA: It does 3d8 on all creatures.

2434
02:06:54,883 --> 02:06:56,694
MATT: Do they get a saving throw?

2435
02:06:56,694 --> 02:07:00,963
LAURA: They get-- yes, they do. They get
half-damage if they save.

2436
02:07:00,963 --> 02:07:04,625
MATT: Mmkay. What's the DC on your spells?

2437
02:07:04,625 --> 02:07:08,494
LAURA: (in a funny gruff voice) My DC is 14.

2438
02:07:08,494 --> 02:07:09,576
ORION: (laughs)

2439
02:07:09,576 --> 02:07:10,720
MATT: All righty.

2440
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,020
ORION: (mimicking Laura's gruff voice)
MemememememeME.

2441
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:13,356
MARISHA: What's your DC, girl?

2442
02:07:13,356 --> 02:07:14,078
LAURA: Okay.

2443
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:16,902
MARISHA: What's yo digits? Gimme those stats.

2444
02:07:16,902 --> 02:07:19,895
MATT: Okay, all you need--

2445
02:07:19,895 --> 02:07:21,199
LAURA: Do I need to roll for attack?

2446
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:22,124
MATT: Only this one makes it.

2447
02:07:22,124 --> 02:07:23,258
LAURA: Oh, sweet!

2448
02:07:23,258 --> 02:07:24,774
MATT: No, the barrage just happens. They're all
caught in it.

2449
02:07:24,774 --> 02:07:25,489
LAURA: Okay, cool.

2450
02:07:25,489 --> 02:07:27,453
MATT: So all of them take full damage, except for
this one takes half damage, so go ahead and roll

2451
02:07:27,453 --> 02:07:28,639
the damage on that.

2452
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:40,030
LAURA: Okay. 3d8. 15, and then 20 for the big one
with the Hunter's Mark.

2453
02:07:40,098 --> 02:07:53,523
MATT: All righty. So. So you moved, did that. Do
you want to move Trinket as well?

2454
02:07:53,523 --> 02:07:55,861
LAURA: Can I have Trinket attack?

2455
02:07:55,861 --> 02:07:57,342
MATT: Trinket--

2456
02:07:57,342 --> 02:07:58,808
LAURA: Oh, that's a lot of them.

2457
02:07:58,808 --> 02:08:01,968
MATT: Well, that, and the spell you cast was an
action. Trinket can attack as part of your attack

2458
02:08:01,968 --> 02:08:02,704
round.

2459
02:08:02,704 --> 02:08:04,535
LAURA: Okay, so I get a second attack?

2460
02:08:04,535 --> 02:08:07,074
MATT: Well, no, your spell was an action. So
that's your turn. You do Conjure Barrage instead

2461
02:08:07,074 --> 02:08:08,553
of your attack.

2462
02:08:08,553 --> 02:08:10,146
LAURA: Cool, I'm going to step back against the
wall.

2463
02:08:10,146 --> 02:08:12,763
MATT: All right, so you step back there. Do you
want to move Trinket anywhere in particular?

2464
02:08:12,763 --> 02:08:14,418
LAURA: Nah, he can't really get anywhere, it's
fine.

2465
02:08:14,418 --> 02:08:15,730
MATT: All right, Trinket is there and-- (bear
noises)

2466
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:17,065
LAURA: It's good times, guys.

2467
02:08:17,065 --> 02:08:19,810
MATT: Angrily, a growl in the distance. Grog,
you're up.

2468
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:21,536
TRAVIS: I'd like to hold my turn.

2469
02:08:21,536 --> 02:08:22,515
SAM: What?

2470
02:08:22,515 --> 02:08:23,403
ORION: Ooh, yeah!

2471
02:08:23,403 --> 02:08:24,805
MATT: All right, Grog holds initiative.

2472
02:08:24,805 --> 02:08:25,767
ORION: Strategy.

2473
02:08:25,767 --> 02:08:26,832
MARISHA: Must be something good.

2474
02:08:26,832 --> 02:08:27,835
MATT: Pike, you're up.

2475
02:08:27,835 --> 02:08:32,913
ASHLEY: Okay, how far can I move up to use a
Spiritual Weapon? I can't tell where I'm at. I'm

2476
02:08:33,082 --> 02:08:34,224
sorry, I didn't wear my glasses.

2477
02:08:34,224 --> 02:08:36,479
MATT: I mean, you can move through your allies
without an issue. You can shift through your own

2478
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:38,806
guys without a problem.

2479
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:44,194
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to cast a golden
spiderweb of thorns.

2480
02:08:44,194 --> 02:08:45,141
SAM: Ooh.

2481
02:08:45,141 --> 02:08:46,152
LAURA: (gasps) What?

2482
02:08:46,152 --> 02:08:47,149
MARISHA: Ooh.

2483
02:08:47,149 --> 02:08:48,130
ORION: (laughs) Nice!

2484
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:49,126
TALIESIN: Fancy.

2485
02:08:49,126 --> 02:08:51,225
MATT: All right. Okay.

2486
02:08:51,225 --> 02:08:53,661
ASHLEY: And encase the spiders.

2487
02:08:53,661 --> 02:08:55,414
MATT: Okay.

2488
02:08:55,414 --> 02:08:56,782
MARISHA: That's cool.

2489
02:08:56,782 --> 02:08:58,664
MATT: Okay.

2490
02:08:58,664 --> 02:09:00,677
(laughter)

2491
02:09:00,677 --> 02:09:02,069
ASHLEY: Like a thorny net.

2492
02:09:02,069 --> 02:09:05,848
MATT: This would be considered a net, if we are
considering a weapon that you are conjuring for this.

2493
02:09:05,848 --> 02:09:07,266
ASHLEY: I'm just making it look really pretty.

2494
02:09:07,266 --> 02:09:08,000
MATT: Right.

2495
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,010
ASHLEY: Basically.

2496
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:10,802
TRAVIS: (quietly) It looks so pretty.

2497
02:09:10,802 --> 02:09:16,248
MATT: So the effect of this-- I'm letting you hit
multiple guys with this. It would not do any

2498
02:09:16,248 --> 02:09:17,413
damage.

2499
02:09:17,413 --> 02:09:19,206
ASHLEY: It wouldn't do any damage, it would just
contain them?

2500
02:09:19,206 --> 02:09:21,648
MATT: It would possibly have an effect on their
ability--

2501
02:09:21,648 --> 02:09:26,028
ASHLEY: Even if they're thorny? Even like holy
thorns? Oh.

2502
02:09:26,028 --> 02:09:27,745
MATT: It would be very itchy for them.

2503
02:09:27,745 --> 02:09:29,246
ASHLEY: All right, you know what?

2504
02:09:29,246 --> 02:09:30,733
ORION: Oh. Well, I mean, that's not out of--

2505
02:09:30,733 --> 02:09:32,014
LAURA: I think you should stick with it, it's
awesome.

2506
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:32,911
SAM: Yeah, man, commit.

2507
02:09:32,911 --> 02:09:33,949
ASHLEY: Okay. Contain them.

2508
02:09:33,949 --> 02:09:34,626
ORION: Yeah, it's thematic.

2509
02:09:34,626 --> 02:09:35,946
ASHLEY: Contain them and then somebody could
just--

2510
02:09:35,946 --> 02:09:36,691
LAURA: Fireball.

2511
02:09:36,691 --> 02:09:37,947
ASHLEY: Throw fire, a fireball at them.

2512
02:09:37,947 --> 02:09:40,090
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a d20 and then
add five to it.

2513
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:45,161
ASHLEY: Okay. 12.

2514
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:46,417
MATT: 12? Okay.

2515
02:09:46,417 --> 02:09:57,431
These four in the immediate front, right
there, as you bring back your mace in the air, you

2516
02:09:57,431 --> 02:10:01,934
kind of hang onto the side with the leather strap
around your wrist. You reach up and grab your holy

2517
02:10:01,934 --> 02:10:06,549
symbol. As you release the holy symbol to hold
your hand up, divine energy streaks out from your

2518
02:10:06,597 --> 02:10:13,107
fingertips and forms into this kind of gold and
silver net. As your arm is doing this kind of

2519
02:10:13,107 --> 02:10:18,512
throwing animation in the air like that, the net
shoots out from the front and spreads down onto

2520
02:10:18,512 --> 02:10:20,560
the spiders and contracts around.

2521
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:24,401
You can see it catches them and they start
scrambling inside. These front four are considered

2522
02:10:24,401 --> 02:10:25,379
grappled.

2523
02:10:25,379 --> 02:10:26,527
(cheering)

2524
02:10:26,527 --> 02:10:27,775
ASHLEY: All right, all right!

2525
02:10:27,775 --> 02:10:29,190
MATT: The one in the back managed to avoid it.

2526
02:10:29,190 --> 02:10:29,901
ORION: Cool.

2527
02:10:29,901 --> 02:10:30,804
LAURA: Nice!

2528
02:10:30,804 --> 02:10:31,632
MARISHA: Nice!

2529
02:10:31,632 --> 02:10:33,276
MATT: That's it? That brings it to Keyleth.

2530
02:10:33,276 --> 02:10:35,962
MARISHA: Okay, with that new development--

2531
02:10:36,026 --> 02:10:38,773
ORION: Wait. Can you do lightning?

2532
02:10:38,773 --> 02:10:46,006
MARISHA: I can. I'm going to do Poison Spray,
though. Where am I right now?

2533
02:10:46,006 --> 02:10:49,275
MATT: You're right here. Behind Pike as she threw
her giant golden net.

2534
02:10:49,275 --> 02:10:54,266
MARISHA: I'm going to be like, 'scuse me, 'scuse
me, Pike, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry.

2535
02:10:54,266 --> 02:10:55,854
ASHLEY: Yes? Oh, go through, go through, go go
go!

2536
02:10:55,854 --> 02:10:57,350
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2537
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:58,831
ASHLEY: Tag you in! Tag you in!

2538
02:10:58,831 --> 02:11:02,794
MARISHA: (whoosh) Poison Spray! It's a ten-foot
cone.

2539
02:11:02,794 --> 02:11:09,048
MATT: Ten-foot cone. If you want to get right up
in here you could get these three there.

2540
02:11:09,048 --> 02:11:10,218
MARISHA: I'll do that.

2541
02:11:10,218 --> 02:11:11,121
MATT: Okay.

2542
02:11:11,121 --> 02:11:14,237
MARISHA: (whoosh) So, it's a constitution saving
throw.

2543
02:11:14,237 --> 02:11:20,903
MATT: Okay. This one succeeds, this one fails,
this one fails.

2544
02:11:20,903 --> 02:11:24,034
SAM: (singing along with the battle music) It's
the music that means we're having a fight.

2545
02:11:24,034 --> 02:11:27,173
MATT: All right. So, this one succeeds, so no
damage, but these two take damage. Go ahead and

2546
02:11:27,173 --> 02:11:28,066
roll it.

2547
02:11:28,066 --> 02:11:33,687
MARISHA: Okay, so they take 2d12. Six. Ugh. Seven
damage.

2548
02:11:33,687 --> 02:11:35,574
MATT: Seven damage to each.

2549
02:11:35,574 --> 02:11:39,037
MARISHA: It's not great. I think he takes half
damage, though, even though he fails.

2550
02:11:39,037 --> 02:11:41,524
MATT: Does he? I think Poison Mist--

2551
02:11:41,524 --> 02:11:42,935
MARISHA: Poison Spray.

2552
02:11:42,935 --> 02:11:45,381
MATT: Oh, Poison Spray. It's a cantrip. I think
it's damage or nothing.

2553
02:11:45,381 --> 02:11:47,955
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, I guess so.

2554
02:11:47,955 --> 02:11:51,709
MATT: All right. It's your move, do you want to
keep moving or do you want to stay where you are?

2555
02:11:51,709 --> 02:11:58,580
MARISHA: Can I get out of everyone's way?

2556
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:04,128
MATT: You're currently-- actually, down from where
you cast it, you would be able to move out, yeah.

2557
02:12:04,128 --> 02:12:05,733
MARISHA: Can I back up a little bit? Yeah.

2558
02:12:05,733 --> 02:12:06,917
MATT: You can, they're still grappled.

2559
02:12:06,917 --> 02:12:08,286
MARISHA: I just kind of want to-- yeah.

2560
02:12:08,286 --> 02:12:09,387
MATT: To there. All right.

2561
02:12:09,387 --> 02:12:10,420
MARISHA: Your turn!

2562
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:12,688
MATT: That ends your turn. Vax, Percy.

2563
02:12:12,688 --> 02:12:16,020
TALIESIN: Please, be my guest.

2564
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:18,014
LIAM: Did you say Vax, Percy?

2565
02:12:18,014 --> 02:12:18,809
MATT: Yes.

2566
02:12:18,809 --> 02:12:19,621
TRAVIS: Yep.

2567
02:12:19,621 --> 02:12:22,888
LIAM: I'm doing my best seeing from where I can
see here. Keyleth is right in front of me?

2568
02:12:22,888 --> 02:12:25,254
MATT: She was. She just pulled behind you.

2569
02:12:25,254 --> 02:12:26,258
MARISHA: I moved behind.

2570
02:12:26,258 --> 02:12:27,343
LAURA: Now you're in front of the spiders.

2571
02:12:27,343 --> 02:12:28,597
MARISHA: You're good, you're in front.

2572
02:12:28,597 --> 02:12:31,802
LIAM: Okay, there's a little bit of distance, so
I'm just going to start hucking daggers at them.

2573
02:12:31,802 --> 02:12:35,218
I'm going to start with dagger of life stealing.

2574
02:12:35,218 --> 02:12:37,713
MARISHA: You're only two squares away.

2575
02:12:37,713 --> 02:12:40,771
LIAM: That is a 16 to hit.

2576
02:12:40,771 --> 02:12:42,431
MATT: 16 to hit? Hits.

2577
02:12:42,431 --> 02:12:49,467
LIAM: Okay, so that is four, six, is ten of
damage.

2578
02:12:49,467 --> 02:12:50,451
MATT: All right.

2579
02:12:50,451 --> 02:12:54,597
LIAM: Then the keen dagger follows. That is a 27.

2580
02:12:54,597 --> 02:12:55,905
MATT: That hits.

2581
02:12:55,905 --> 02:12:59,940
LIAM: That hits for ten damage, and then--

2582
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:01,625
LAURA: You're killing them!

2583
02:13:01,625 --> 02:13:02,896
LIAM: And then the flametongue dagger.

2584
02:13:02,896 --> 02:13:06,970
MATT: You're not Hasted anymore, by the way.

2585
02:13:07,032 --> 02:13:10,084
LIAM: You're right, forget it, yeah, forget that
last. That's right, two.

2586
02:13:10,084 --> 02:13:15,956
MATT: So as you're off to the side hiding among
the slowly burning webbing, you move around, huck

2587
02:13:16,167 --> 02:13:20,739
both daggers. One strikes a spider right in the
center of where its eyes are and it screeches for

2588
02:13:20,947 --> 02:13:27,202
a second before it curls up, its legs kind of
pulling into its torso. The other one begins to

2589
02:13:27,202 --> 02:13:31,922
pull out of the net that Pike set, and as it does
you throw the secondary dagger. It strikes it in

2590
02:13:31,922 --> 02:13:36,833
its abdomen, and the blade retracts and returns to
your belt, and as it does, it leaves this streak

2591
02:13:36,833 --> 02:13:41,965
of greenish liquid. And you have a better view of
these spiders now. Go ahead and make a nature

2592
02:13:41,965 --> 02:13:46,259
check, both Keyleth and Vex.

2593
02:13:46,259 --> 02:13:47,436
MARISHA: Dope.

2594
02:13:47,436 --> 02:13:51,043
ORION: By the way, I'm here, but I'm also there.

2595
02:13:51,043 --> 02:13:52,925
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2596
02:13:52,925 --> 02:13:54,718
(yelling)

2597
02:13:54,718 --> 02:13:55,867
MATT: You're also there?

2598
02:13:55,867 --> 02:13:56,751
ORION: Cloak of Displacement.

2599
02:13:56,751 --> 02:13:57,908
LAURA: Good, because I rolled an eight.

2600
02:13:57,908 --> 02:13:58,705
MATT: Oh.

2601
02:13:58,705 --> 02:13:59,721
ORION: There's like two of me.

2602
02:13:59,721 --> 02:14:02,204
MATT: All right. So, Keyleth

2603
02:14:02,204 --> 02:14:04,151
SAM: (whistles with the battle music)

2604
02:14:04,151 --> 02:14:07,757
MATT: You notice as most spider-like creatures go,
you're used to like the darker, furry, wolf-spider

2605
02:14:07,757 --> 02:14:16,371
types. These have a different color. Their
physical bodies are more white and blue. Their

2606
02:14:16,371 --> 02:14:20,629
coloration is mostly white but with a kind of
bluish hue to it and their eyes are almost

2607
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:22,639
pink-white in color.

2608
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:23,684
LAURA: Ugh.

2609
02:14:23,684 --> 02:14:25,280
ASHLEY: Because they live underground. There's no
sunlight.

2610
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,033
MATT: They're a very strange, different kind of
spider.

2611
02:14:27,033 --> 02:14:28,370
LIAM: I don't like this.

2612
02:14:28,370 --> 02:14:30,378
MARISHA: Is that all I know, with my natural 20?

2613
02:14:30,378 --> 02:14:36,510
MATT: You haven't encountered too many types of
arachnids, but there's something about them that

2614
02:14:36,510 --> 02:14:40,416
seems loosely themed in the ethereal.

2615
02:14:40,416 --> 02:14:41,784
LAURA: Oh.

2616
02:14:41,784 --> 02:14:43,854
MARISHA: Hm.

2617
02:14:43,854 --> 02:14:51,554
MATT: You in your experience, you've heard of
certain spiders that can travel through the planes

2618
02:14:51,554 --> 02:14:52,976
rapidly.

2619
02:14:52,976 --> 02:14:55,759
ORION: Now damn plane spiders?

2620
02:14:55,759 --> 02:14:57,662
TRAVIS: Maybe we don't have to kill it, maybe they
just (pfft).

2621
02:14:57,662 --> 02:14:58,482
MARISHA: Gotcha.

2622
02:14:58,482 --> 02:15:00,860
Hey, guys, I think these are like magical
bamf-ing spiders.

2623
02:15:00,910 --> 02:15:01,982
ORION: Oh.

2624
02:15:01,982 --> 02:15:02,784
TALIESIN: Okay.

2625
02:15:02,784 --> 02:15:03,706
SAM: Cool, bro, let's kill them.

2626
02:15:03,706 --> 02:15:04,798
MARISHA: Yeah, let's kill them.

2627
02:15:04,798 --> 02:15:06,395
TALIESIN: There's one spider that's not caught?

2628
02:15:06,395 --> 02:15:08,392
LAURA: There's what, there's three spiders left?

2629
02:15:08,392 --> 02:15:09,537
MATT: Yes, one back here.

2630
02:15:09,537 --> 02:15:13,039
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take a couple of
shots at it with my Sharpshooter, so let's start

2631
02:15:13,039 --> 02:15:19,757
with 24 to hit?

2632
02:15:19,757 --> 02:15:22,765
MATT: What was it?

2633
02:15:22,765 --> 02:15:23,917
TALIESIN: 24 to hit?

2634
02:15:23,917 --> 02:15:25,100
MATT: That hits.

2635
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:26,988
TALIESIN: And let's do this. My first shot--

2636
02:15:26,988 --> 02:15:28,505
SAM: Ka-pew!

2637
02:15:28,505 --> 02:15:30,510
TALIESIN: That's depressing.

2638
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:34,047
Well, I get the bonus, so that's 18
points of damage.

2639
02:15:34,112 --> 02:15:36,115
MATT: 18 points of damage? All righty.

2640
02:15:36,115 --> 02:15:37,018
MARISHA: That's not too depressing.

2641
02:15:37,018 --> 02:15:37,835
ASHLEY: That's not depressing at all.

2642
02:15:37,835 --> 02:15:38,863
TRAVIS: That's not depressing.

2643
02:15:38,863 --> 02:15:41,191
TALIESIN: That's not too depressing. It's because
I'm taking a negative five to hit.

2644
02:15:41,191 --> 02:15:42,754
LAURA: Oh.

2645
02:15:42,814 --> 02:15:51,926
TALIESIN: And that's-- oh, that's not bad. I have
new numbers. 16 to hit.

2646
02:15:51,926 --> 02:15:54,058
MATT: 16 does also hit, yeah.

2647
02:15:54,058 --> 02:15:55,051
TALIESIN: Aha!

2648
02:15:55,051 --> 02:15:55,948
MATT: Same target?

2649
02:15:55,948 --> 02:16:05,088
TALIESIN: Same target, with an added fire bonus.
Three fire damage and 17 as well.

2650
02:16:05,088 --> 02:16:06,205
MATT: All right.

2651
02:16:06,205 --> 02:16:07,297
TALIESIN: 17 plus three fire damage.

2652
02:16:07,297 --> 02:16:08,241
ASHLEY: That bonus is awesome.

2653
02:16:08,241 --> 02:16:09,178
LAURA: He is so dead.

2654
02:16:09,178 --> 02:16:10,822
MATT: (gunshot noise) That spider gets splattered.
You see there's a burst of flame and a (explosion

2655
02:16:10,822 --> 02:16:15,552
noise) as its body is knocked in the air, torn
asunder, and then consumed by the flame burst at

2656
02:16:15,552 --> 02:16:20,182
the same time. You see what looks like a
scattering of ash across the ground and the steps

2657
02:16:20,182 --> 02:16:20,996
beneath it.

2658
02:16:20,996 --> 02:16:22,366
MARISHA: It looks like flash paper?

2659
02:16:22,366 --> 02:16:23,126
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

2660
02:16:23,126 --> 02:16:24,389
TALIESIN: And I duck back behind Grog.

2661
02:16:24,389 --> 02:16:25,805
(laughter)

2662
02:16:25,805 --> 02:16:27,762
TRAVIS: Where are you going?

2663
02:16:27,762 --> 02:16:37,029
MATT: All right. These two spiders that are
currently caught in the net both (whoosh) vanish

2664
02:16:37,029 --> 02:16:38,132
and the net falls flat.

2665
02:16:38,132 --> 02:16:40,111
LAURA: Oh, bamf-ing spiders.

2666
02:16:40,111 --> 02:16:41,537
MATT: (teleportation noise)

2667
02:16:41,537 --> 02:16:44,451
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

2668
02:16:44,451 --> 02:16:48,247
MATT: One is striking at you.

2669
02:16:48,247 --> 02:16:49,693
LAURA: Me?

2670
02:16:49,693 --> 02:16:52,644
MATT: That is a 21 to hit.

2671
02:16:52,644 --> 02:16:54,149
LAURA: It hits me.

2672
02:16:54,149 --> 02:16:56,195
MATT: And against Percy, that is a 25.

2673
02:16:56,195 --> 02:16:57,844
TALIESIN: Oh my god, that hits.

2674
02:16:57,844 --> 02:17:01,794
MATT: All right. You both take 13 points of
piercing damage

2675
02:17:01,794 --> 02:17:02,778
TALIESIN: Ow!

2676
02:17:02,778 --> 02:17:05,405
MATT: And I need you both to make a constitution
saving throw.

2677
02:17:05,405 --> 02:17:06,992
(groaning)

2678
02:17:06,992 --> 02:17:10,590
TALIESIN: Oh, bugger.

2679
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:11,931
MARISHA: That can't be good.

2680
02:17:11,931 --> 02:17:13,466
TALIESIN: 13 points of piercing damage?

2681
02:17:13,466 --> 02:17:14,755
MATT: Mm-hm.

2682
02:17:14,755 --> 02:17:16,386
MARISHA: They poofed. Poofers.

2683
02:17:16,386 --> 02:17:18,297
LAURA: 17? Oh, wait. 19.

2684
02:17:18,297 --> 02:17:21,457
MATT: 19 constitution saving throw.

2685
02:17:21,457 --> 02:17:25,366
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. (blows
raspberry)

2686
02:17:25,366 --> 02:17:27,128
MARISHA: Oh, no, Percy!

2687
02:17:27,128 --> 02:17:28,546
TALIESIN: Rolled a one.

2688
02:17:28,546 --> 02:17:32,918
MATT: So as all of a sudden, the strange
(teleportation noise) sound streaks behind you,

2689
02:17:32,918 --> 02:17:36,804
you turn over your shoulder just in time to see
the spiders pop out of seemingly nowhere and

2690
02:17:36,804 --> 02:17:40,453
strike into you. The fangs sink into your side and
you knock them off with your elbow.

2691
02:17:40,453 --> 02:17:41,675
LAURA: (grunts in pain)

2692
02:17:41,675 --> 02:17:46,642
MATT: You feel the venom extract itself from the
fangs, but just as you pull it out of the side,

2693
02:17:46,642 --> 02:17:51,156
so it actually does not envenom your body. Percy,
you're not so lucky. The venom pulses into the

2694
02:17:51,218 --> 02:17:52,170
side of your shoulder.

2695
02:17:52,170 --> 02:17:53,339
TALIESIN: (groans in pain)

2696
02:17:53,339 --> 02:17:56,905
MATT: And you feel this burning sensation ripple
through your entire upper right torso. You take 21

2697
02:17:56,905 --> 02:17:58,600
points of poison damage.

2698
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:00,570
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

2699
02:18:00,570 --> 02:18:05,177
LIAM: What was that number, again?

2700
02:18:05,177 --> 02:18:06,627
ALL: 21.

2701
02:18:06,627 --> 02:18:08,339
SAM: He's fine, he's fine.

2702
02:18:08,339 --> 02:18:10,403
MARISHA: Is that all it does, just poison him?

2703
02:18:10,403 --> 02:18:11,344
MATT: Yep.

2704
02:18:11,344 --> 02:18:12,586
TALIESIN: I am poisoned, though.

2705
02:18:12,586 --> 02:18:14,376
MATT: You are not considered poisoned. It's the
damage that's poison.

2706
02:18:14,376 --> 02:18:15,469
LAURA: Oh, it's straight-up damage.

2707
02:18:15,469 --> 02:18:17,577
MARISHA: Okay, that's not too bad.

2708
02:18:17,577 --> 02:18:19,383
TALIESIN: It could be worse.

2709
02:18:19,383 --> 02:18:22,307
MATT: That ends their turn. Tiberius? You're still
holding your turn, Grog?

2710
02:18:22,307 --> 02:18:23,273
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

2711
02:18:23,273 --> 02:18:24,284
MARISHA: I did take Protection From Poison.

2712
02:18:24,284 --> 02:18:25,348
LAURA: I should cast that on us.

2713
02:18:25,348 --> 02:18:26,500
MARISHA: If that's necessary.

2714
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:28,035
MATT: All right, Tiberius?

2715
02:18:28,035 --> 02:18:29,369
ORION: So we're in a hallway, a stairwell?

2716
02:18:29,369 --> 02:18:32,259
MATT: Yes, it's a stairway heading down,
essentially, right here, and then it evens out at

2717
02:18:32,259 --> 02:18:33,440
the bottom point there.

2718
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:35,925
MARISHA: Fighting on the stairs.

2719
02:18:35,925 --> 02:18:39,250
ORION: Is it like a big--

2720
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:44,786
MATT: It's about 15 feet up to the ceiling. Ten,
15.

2721
02:18:44,786 --> 02:18:46,695
ORION: Oh. Very well.

2722
02:18:46,695 --> 02:18:47,956
How many are left, two?

2723
02:18:47,956 --> 02:18:48,750
MATT: Two.

2724
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:49,483
LAURA: Yeah.

2725
02:18:49,483 --> 02:18:50,875
ORION: Obelisk of Stone.

2726
02:18:50,875 --> 02:18:52,104
MATT: Okay.

2727
02:18:52,104 --> 02:18:53,229
MARISHA: Squishy spiders.

2728
02:18:53,229 --> 02:18:54,282
ORION: Yeah, these squishy spiders.

2729
02:18:54,282 --> 02:18:59,322
MATT: So as both the spiders are knocked off both
Percy and Vex, you guys kind of rear back, ready

2730
02:18:59,322 --> 02:19:04,573
to defend yourselves. Suddenly the stairwell
shakes for a second and pillars of stone go (stone

2731
02:19:04,573 --> 02:19:08,922
crushing noises) from underneath. Similar to the
trap room you encountered earlier.

2732
02:19:08,922 --> 02:19:17,948
ORION: That's it. 21.

2733
02:19:17,948 --> 02:19:20,392
MATT: 21? And what's the DC on your spell?

2734
02:19:20,392 --> 02:19:21,373
ORION: 17.

2735
02:19:21,373 --> 02:19:26,993
MATT: 17? Both spiders get mashed pretty horribly
into the ceiling. You see where the pillars are

2736
02:19:26,993 --> 02:19:31,533
slammed into the ceiling permanently. You can see
the legs kind of dangling out for a second and then

2737
02:19:31,533 --> 02:19:35,280
slowly curl in towards where the edge of the
stone pillars are at the ceiling.

2738
02:19:35,343 --> 02:19:36,443
LAURA: Eat it.

2739
02:19:36,443 --> 02:19:40,665
MARISHA: Are there any corpses that are more
accessible than the one that got torched and the

2740
02:19:40,665 --> 02:19:41,801
ones that are squished?

2741
02:19:41,801 --> 02:19:44,156
TRAVIS: Yeah, are there any spider fangs we can
put in the bag?

2742
02:19:44,156 --> 02:19:46,876
MARISHA: Yeah, because I have that book that helps
me do that now.

2743
02:19:46,876 --> 02:19:48,189
TALIESIN: There's the one I shot.

2744
02:19:48,189 --> 02:19:54,162
MATT: You can, actually, there are-- there's one
that you shot. No, actually, the one that you

2745
02:19:54,162 --> 02:19:56,019
killed is the one that burst into flame.

2746
02:19:56,019 --> 02:19:57,515
TALIESIN: Yes, the one that burst into flame.

2747
02:19:57,515 --> 02:20:01,076
MATT: That one's not going to be salvageable.
There's a few that you and Vex killed. Vex and Vax

2748
02:20:01,076 --> 02:20:05,175
both just kind of wiped out a few of the spiders.
Go ahead and make an herbalism roll.

2749
02:20:05,175 --> 02:20:09,225
LAURA: Ooh, I bet we can get some of that poison.
Dip the arrows in it.

2750
02:20:09,225 --> 02:20:14,935
MARISHA: What did the book do again, gave me a
plus or an advantage? Did it give me an advantage

2751
02:20:14,935 --> 02:20:17,313
on rolls or like a plus something?

2752
02:20:17,313 --> 02:20:20,185
MATT: I asked you to write that down. I will say
advantage.

2753
02:20:20,185 --> 02:20:22,315
MARISHA: Oh, wait, you did ask me to write it down
and I think I did.

2754
02:20:22,315 --> 02:20:24,545
MATT: Advantage or a bonus, which of the two is
it?

2755
02:20:24,545 --> 02:20:26,946
MARISHA: Oh, no, I didn't write it down, I just
wrote that I have the books.

2756
02:20:26,946 --> 02:20:30,987
MATT: Ah. I don't remember what I did for that.

2757
02:20:31,034 --> 02:20:34,794
I will say advantage. That's the easiest to
remember.

2758
02:20:34,794 --> 02:20:40,534
MARISHA: That's better. 24.

2759
02:20:40,534 --> 02:20:47,198
MATT: 24. You managed to extract two poison glands
from one of the spiders. The other ones were too

2760
02:20:47,198 --> 02:20:48,542
damaged beyond repair.

2761
02:20:48,542 --> 02:20:49,255
LAURA: Ooh.

2762
02:20:49,255 --> 02:20:49,950
ORION: Sweet.

2763
02:20:49,950 --> 02:20:50,773
MARISHA: Two poison glands.

2764
02:20:50,773 --> 02:20:51,707
MATT: Two small venom glands.

2765
02:20:51,707 --> 02:20:52,407
ORION: Nice.

2766
02:20:52,407 --> 02:20:54,128
MARISHA: I give them to the twins.

2767
02:20:54,128 --> 02:20:54,938
MATT: Okay.

2768
02:20:54,938 --> 02:20:56,363
LAURA: Oh, we can just use them?

2769
02:20:56,363 --> 02:20:57,132
MATT: You don't know.

2770
02:20:57,132 --> 02:20:57,989
LAURA: Okay.

2771
02:20:57,989 --> 02:21:00,564
MATT: She hands you two nasty-looking glands that
are still wet with spider ichor.

2772
02:21:00,564 --> 02:21:02,037
MARISHA: I got this for you guys.

2773
02:21:02,037 --> 02:21:03,481
LAURA: Oh, thank you, Keyleth.

2774
02:21:03,481 --> 02:21:04,950
TRAVIS: Do you want me to hold onto them?

2775
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:07,298
LIAM: That's very... that's sweet. I love it.

2776
02:21:07,298 --> 02:21:11,030
LAURA: Tiberius, would you happen to have a little
glass vial or something I could put this in?

2777
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:12,355
ORION: I think I have two left.

2778
02:21:12,355 --> 02:21:13,129
LAURA: Oh!

2779
02:21:13,129 --> 02:21:14,093
ORION: I need to get more.

2780
02:21:14,093 --> 02:21:14,964
TRAVIS: I have them.

2781
02:21:14,964 --> 02:21:15,948
ORION: Oh, here we go. (pop)

2782
02:21:15,948 --> 02:21:17,009
LAURA: Thank you.

2783
02:21:17,009 --> 02:21:19,299
TALIESIN: (laughs) Well.

2784
02:21:19,299 --> 02:21:21,711
TRAVIS: I'm like a Wal-Mart over here. You could
have asked me, but that's cool.

2785
02:21:21,711 --> 02:21:23,278
MARISHA: Your book helps.

2786
02:21:23,278 --> 02:21:24,722
SAM: I'm ready to make my attack turn.

2787
02:21:24,722 --> 02:21:28,023
MATT: All right. There is nothing there.

2788
02:21:28,023 --> 02:21:29,758
(laughter)

2789
02:21:29,758 --> 02:21:32,076
SAM: I sheath my sword.

2790
02:21:32,076 --> 02:21:33,381
MATT: There you go.

2791
02:21:33,381 --> 02:21:35,134
(laughter)

2792
02:21:35,134 --> 02:21:40,146
TALIESIN: A little help here, please? Would be
nice.

2793
02:21:40,146 --> 02:21:40,950
ASHLEY: Yes.

2794
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:42,782
LAURA: Oh. Oh, wait, I thought you weren't
poisoned-- oh, you need healing because you are--

2795
02:21:42,782 --> 02:21:43,901
ASHLEY: What are you at?

2796
02:21:43,901 --> 02:21:45,104
TALIESIN: I'm at 47.

2797
02:21:45,104 --> 02:21:45,840
LAURA: Okay.

2798
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:46,740
ASHLEY: Okay.

2799
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:48,164
SAM: Eh, you're fine. Suck it up.

2800
02:21:48,164 --> 02:21:49,963
ASHLEY: I guess we all need some-- what's
everybody else at?

2801
02:21:49,963 --> 02:21:54,670
LIAM: Ah, that's what I was at after I healed
myself with a handful of hit dice after getting

2802
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:55,913
crushed into the ceiling.

2803
02:21:55,913 --> 02:21:57,679
LAURA: Yeah, but we took a short break and we're
not doing that now.

2804
02:21:57,679 --> 02:21:59,498
SAM: Use your hit dice, you'll be fine.

2805
02:21:59,498 --> 02:22:01,057
TALIESIN: I could just use my-- oh.

2806
02:22:01,057 --> 02:22:02,031
ASHLEY: Um, hold on.

2807
02:22:02,031 --> 02:22:03,481
MATT: Are you guys taking a short rest, is that
what you're doing?

2808
02:22:03,481 --> 02:22:04,136
LAURA: No.

2809
02:22:04,136 --> 02:22:04,878
TRAVIS: No, no.

2810
02:22:04,878 --> 02:22:05,748
MARISHA: No, we're good.

2811
02:22:05,748 --> 02:22:06,970
ASHLEY: Let me heal you up, Percy, hold on.

2812
02:22:06,970 --> 02:22:08,037
LAURA: Can I ask a question while she's healing
Percy?

2813
02:22:08,037 --> 02:22:09,085
ORION: We've taken a short rest already, right?

2814
02:22:09,085 --> 02:22:09,954
MARISHA: Yeah.

2815
02:22:09,954 --> 02:22:11,875
LAURA: The grappling arrow I used on the little
halfling, I can get that back, right?

2816
02:22:11,875 --> 02:22:13,208
MATT: Yeah, you retrieved it.

2817
02:22:13,208 --> 02:22:15,746
LAURA: Just making sure.

2818
02:22:15,746 --> 02:22:19,335
SAM: I'll continue on down the hallway.

2819
02:22:19,335 --> 02:22:20,766
TRAVIS: I join him.

2820
02:22:20,766 --> 02:22:23,797
MATT: Keyleth, are you still using Pass Without a
Trace?

2821
02:22:23,797 --> 02:22:25,919
MARISHA: No.

2822
02:22:25,919 --> 02:22:26,854
LAURA: No?

2823
02:22:26,854 --> 02:22:28,945
SAM: She had to break it to use Stoneskin.

2824
02:22:28,945 --> 02:22:30,091
MATT: It's a concentration spell, isn't it?

2825
02:22:30,091 --> 02:22:31,406
MARISHA: Yeah, but I cast Stoneskin on myself.

2826
02:22:31,406 --> 02:22:33,381
MATT: You did. All right. So go ahead and make a
stealth roll.

2827
02:22:33,381 --> 02:22:34,542
MARISHA: Sorry.

2828
02:22:34,542 --> 02:22:38,099
SAM: Not good. Nine.

2829
02:22:38,099 --> 02:22:39,308
TRAVIS: I'm with you.

2830
02:22:39,308 --> 02:22:40,211
MATT: Nine. All right.

2831
02:22:40,211 --> 02:22:41,545
SAM: (nasal voice) Nine.

2832
02:22:41,545 --> 02:22:42,835
ASHLEY: Nine, Percy.

2833
02:22:42,835 --> 02:22:46,270
LIAM: I would like to continue to stealth ahead of
the group and also continue checking for traps.

2834
02:22:46,270 --> 02:22:47,599
SAM: We already went.

2835
02:22:47,599 --> 02:22:48,921
TRAVIS: Scanlan's already ahead of you.

2836
02:22:48,921 --> 02:22:49,746
LAURA: Sam already said it.

2837
02:22:49,746 --> 02:22:50,685
LIAM: Oh, he is?

2838
02:22:50,685 --> 02:22:54,412
MATT: As you stealthily move along the side of the
wall, Scanlan comes pattering down the stonework.

2839
02:22:54,412 --> 02:22:55,542
SAM: Skipping.

2840
02:22:55,542 --> 02:22:58,455
ASHLEY: Percy, 18.

2841
02:22:58,455 --> 02:22:59,747
TALIESIN: 18? Thank you.

2842
02:22:59,747 --> 02:23:00,916
LAURA: Scanlan, no. (groans)

2843
02:23:00,916 --> 02:23:04,229
MATT: Into what is a large central chamber. You
can see webbing scattered throughout the entirety

2844
02:23:04,229 --> 02:23:12,840
of the stone room. It's about 60 feet up. There is
very low light from the flickering sconces that

2845
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:18,545
are on the walls of this towards the base of the
actual room. The building in the center, it looks

2846
02:23:18,545 --> 02:23:22,940
almost like an ancient mausoleum structure, how
it's placed in the center of the room. Closed

2847
02:23:22,993 --> 02:23:27,349
stone doors. But what catches your eye is that the
entirety of the structure seems to be crafted of

2848
02:23:27,349 --> 02:23:32,951
the same platinum-like material as the container
that you guys are carrying the horn in.

2849
02:23:32,951 --> 02:23:33,935
LAURA: Oh, wow.

2850
02:23:33,935 --> 02:23:35,004
SAM: Oh, we made it.

2851
02:23:35,004 --> 02:23:36,819
LAURA: Are there sapphires all over the walls in
here, then?

2852
02:23:36,819 --> 02:23:40,614
MATT: Not the walls of the actual chamber itself,
just this central building right there.

2853
02:23:40,614 --> 02:23:42,885
ORION: We're not stealing from this place.

2854
02:23:42,885 --> 02:23:45,259
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check, anyone
who wishes to look for traps.

2855
02:23:45,259 --> 02:23:46,307
SAM: While we're out there, I'm going to check--

2856
02:23:46,307 --> 02:23:49,173
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no, that was my big fancy one.

2857
02:23:49,173 --> 02:23:53,956
ORION: Nice. I'm going to check for any arcane
stuff and I got--

2858
02:23:53,956 --> 02:23:55,127
LIAM: 14.

2859
02:23:55,127 --> 02:23:56,567
MATT: 14 perception.

2860
02:23:56,567 --> 02:23:57,655
LIAM: Yeah, 14.

2861
02:23:57,655 --> 02:23:59,757
ORION: I'm going to check for 25.

2862
02:23:59,757 --> 02:24:01,098
TALIESIN: 21.

2863
02:24:01,098 --> 02:24:03,053
MATT: Perception?

2864
02:24:03,053 --> 02:24:04,359
TALIESIN: Perception, 21.

2865
02:24:04,359 --> 02:24:06,398
MATT: Okay. 25 for arcane?

2866
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:07,372
ORION: Yeah.

2867
02:24:07,372 --> 02:24:16,025
MATT: Best you can gather, as far as the presence
of any arcane in this room, the scrolling on the

2868
02:24:16,025 --> 02:24:24,358
structure in front of you, there are elements of
the scrolling that you can see are based in the

2869
02:24:24,358 --> 02:24:31,557
arcane runes that are used for ritual inscribing,
but there's nothing of any magic that you've ever

2870
02:24:31,557 --> 02:24:36,440
been familiar with that is utilized in this
structure. What did you roll?

2871
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:39,391
LAURA: Really, really high. Eight.

2872
02:24:39,391 --> 02:24:43,240
MATT: All right. So, who is moving in? Who wants
to--

2873
02:24:43,240 --> 02:24:45,473
SAM: I moved in with Grog.

2874
02:24:45,473 --> 02:24:46,979
TRAVIS: I move in as well.

2875
02:24:46,979 --> 02:24:48,096
LIAM: I'm moving in.

2876
02:24:48,096 --> 02:24:50,843
LAURA: Can I try to stealth and move alongside
just kind of keep to the edge?

2877
02:24:50,843 --> 02:24:51,620
ASHLEY: Going in.

2878
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:52,593
TRAVIS: We're all going in.

2879
02:24:52,593 --> 02:24:53,692
LIAM: Ditto, kiddo.

2880
02:24:53,692 --> 02:24:55,919
MATT: All right, you move off to the side, kind of
pushing through some of the webs and there's still

2881
02:24:55,919 --> 02:24:57,351
webs on the side of the room.

2882
02:24:57,351 --> 02:25:00,523
ORION: I'll keep close to the guards and the box.

2883
02:25:00,523 --> 02:25:01,607
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go in.

2884
02:25:01,607 --> 02:25:03,292
LAURA: Okay, I rolled 18 on the stealth.

2885
02:25:03,292 --> 02:25:04,196
MATT: All righty.

2886
02:25:04,196 --> 02:25:06,209
ASHLEY: I'll go in close to Grog.

2887
02:25:06,209 --> 02:25:07,382
MATT: All righty.

2888
02:25:07,382 --> 02:25:08,394
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2889
02:25:08,394 --> 02:25:09,932
LIAM: I'm going to tail my sister, actually.

2890
02:25:09,932 --> 02:25:13,084
MATT: All right. (whoosh) You move around over
here with your sister.

2891
02:25:13,084 --> 02:25:16,256
LAURA: And Trinket's going to stay next to
Keyleth.

2892
02:25:16,256 --> 02:25:17,503
MATT: All righty.

2893
02:25:17,503 --> 02:25:19,063
MARISHA: Come here, Trinket.

2894
02:25:19,063 --> 02:25:20,186
MATT: So they'll go back to this point.

2895
02:25:20,186 --> 02:25:22,010
SAM: I'm going to go invisible.

2896
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:27,996
TALIESIN: Wait. I'm furry, but I'm not Trinket.
Jesus Christ.

2897
02:25:27,996 --> 02:25:29,592
MARISHA: (laughs)

2898
02:25:29,592 --> 02:25:31,176
MATT: All right, you are currently marked as
invisible, Scanlan.

2899
02:25:31,176 --> 02:25:33,810
LAURA: Can we see a spider in here, like a big
spider?

2900
02:25:33,810 --> 02:25:35,148
MATT: You don't.

2901
02:25:35,148 --> 02:25:37,036
MARISHA: There's always a big mama spider.

2902
02:25:37,036 --> 02:25:38,747
LAURA: Okay, can I-- it's dark?

2903
02:25:38,747 --> 02:25:39,771
MATT: It's very low light.

2904
02:25:39,771 --> 02:25:41,084
SAM: No one's cast Light yet.

2905
02:25:41,084 --> 02:25:41,969
ORION: I know.

2906
02:25:41,969 --> 02:25:44,502
LAURA: I'm going to use my Primeval Awareness and
see if I can sense any spiders in the area.

2907
02:25:44,502 --> 02:25:54,682
MATT: Okay. You take a moment to concentrate and
you sense-- while not in visible range, on the

2908
02:25:54,682 --> 02:26:04,053
opposite side of this room, a whole bunch of tiny
little life sources and one rather large one.

2909
02:26:04,053 --> 02:26:05,494
LAURA: Good to know.

2910
02:26:05,494 --> 02:26:06,358
TRAVIS: Shit.

2911
02:26:06,358 --> 02:26:07,191
ASHLEY: Ugh.

2912
02:26:07,191 --> 02:26:11,771
LAURA: (whispers) Lots of spiders. Lots. I'm going
to cast Protection From Poison on myself.

2913
02:26:11,771 --> 02:26:12,746
MATT: All right.

2914
02:26:12,746 --> 02:26:14,260
TRAVIS: I cast Terminix.

2915
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:15,979
TALIESIN: (laughs)

2916
02:26:15,979 --> 02:26:19,132
LIAM: I'm drinking a healing potion right now.

2917
02:26:19,132 --> 02:26:20,467
MATT: All righty.

2918
02:26:20,467 --> 02:26:22,929
ASHLEY: I'm going to do the same thing.

2919
02:26:22,929 --> 02:26:27,529
MARISHA: Also, I'll go ahead and-- nah, nah, it's
fine.

2920
02:26:27,529 --> 02:26:29,778
TALIESIN: What does a level two healing potion do,
again?

2921
02:26:29,778 --> 02:26:31,721
MARISHA: I'm going to keep my Stoneskin up.

2922
02:26:31,721 --> 02:26:33,954
ASHLEY: Yeah, what's the level two?

2923
02:26:33,954 --> 02:26:38,607
MATT: Level two healing potion does 4d4 + 4.

2924
02:26:38,607 --> 02:26:43,629
ORION: I'm going to go use Greater Invisibility,
as well.

2925
02:26:43,629 --> 02:26:46,309
MATT: Okay. All right. You are also considered
invisible.

2926
02:26:46,309 --> 02:26:47,531
SAM: Why greater?

2927
02:26:47,531 --> 02:26:51,362
ORION: Because I can cast and still stay
invisible.

2928
02:26:51,362 --> 02:26:59,017
MATT: All right, Kima pushes ahead through the group
while you guys are doing this, walks up to the

2929
02:26:59,066 --> 02:27:03,473
front of the chamber, and you see she takes the
holy symbol around from her neck, the symbol of

2930
02:27:03,524 --> 02:27:09,266
Bahamut, and much like she did to the doorway at
the bottom of the temple earlier to find this

2931
02:27:09,266 --> 02:27:14,804
initial passageway, she feels around in the
scrolling and eventually finds a section of it and

2932
02:27:14,804 --> 02:27:20,844
rotates what looks like a circular part of it that
shifts and then pulls out. When she pulls it out,

2933
02:27:20,844 --> 02:27:27,117
you can see there is a kind of engraving, there is
a recessed engraving of the same shape as her holy

2934
02:27:27,117 --> 02:27:28,144
symbol.

2935
02:27:28,144 --> 02:27:32,123
LAURA: Before she touches anything, can I let her
know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the

2936
02:27:32,123 --> 02:27:33,393
other side of the room.

2937
02:27:33,393 --> 02:27:34,359
MATT: You may do that.

2938
02:27:34,359 --> 02:27:35,790
SAM: Wait, what? You didn't tell any of us that.

2939
02:27:35,790 --> 02:27:38,485
TRAVIS: Can I shift to her right flank, just at
the corner of the mausoleum structure?

2940
02:27:38,485 --> 02:27:39,805
Right there.

2941
02:27:39,805 --> 02:27:43,054
LAURA: Just so everybody's aware, those things we
just fought? There's a ton more of them on the

2942
02:27:43,054 --> 02:27:44,327
other side of this little chamber.

2943
02:27:44,327 --> 02:27:45,688
SAM: Oh, thanks for telling us.

2944
02:27:45,688 --> 02:27:46,584
LAURA: No problem.

2945
02:27:46,584 --> 02:27:47,557
MATT: Grog, make a stealth check.

2946
02:27:47,557 --> 02:27:48,968
MARISHA: (whispers) Be very quiet.

2947
02:27:48,968 --> 02:27:51,455
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Natural 20.

2948
02:27:51,455 --> 02:27:53,479
(cheering)

2949
02:27:53,479 --> 02:27:55,740
TALIESIN: Spiderman.

2950
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:58,124
LAURA: Good thing you took that beard off because
it had bells and shit in it.

2951
02:27:58,124 --> 02:27:59,505
TRAVIS: Oh, the beard is still there.

2952
02:27:59,505 --> 02:28:00,681
SAM: No, no, it fell off.

2953
02:28:00,681 --> 02:28:02,019
TRAVIS: Its most majestic part fell off.

2954
02:28:02,019 --> 02:28:02,943
SAM: Oh.

2955
02:28:02,943 --> 02:28:05,134
MATT: Yeah. There's still some goliath peach fuzz
there.

2956
02:28:05,134 --> 02:28:06,443
TRAVIS: Substantial Viking-ness happening.

2957
02:28:06,443 --> 02:28:12,367
MATT: Grog, for a moment there, you recess into
your old hunter training when you were traveling with

2958
02:28:12,367 --> 02:28:19,675
your barbarian tribe and you take in the darkness
around you and walk, fleet of foot, to the edge of

2959
02:28:19,728 --> 02:28:22,775
it, not making a single sound. You're damn proud
of yourself.

2960
02:28:22,775 --> 02:28:23,941
TRAVIS: I am.

2961
02:28:23,941 --> 02:28:24,967
TALIESIN: (whispers) Quietly.

2962
02:28:24,967 --> 02:28:27,243
MATT: So as you tell this to Kima, she goes,
(whispers) "What? Spiders?"

2963
02:28:27,243 --> 02:28:30,602
LAURA: (whispers) Lots and lots of spiders. Is
that going to make noise?

2964
02:28:30,602 --> 02:28:33,403
MATT: (whispers) "I don't know. I haven't been in
this chamber before."

2965
02:28:33,403 --> 02:28:39,142
LAURA: Perhaps we should deal with the spiders
before we make noise, or maybe just be prepared.

2966
02:28:39,142 --> 02:28:44,586
In fact, you know what? I'm going to cast Spike
Growth on the ground in between where they're

2967
02:28:44,586 --> 02:28:46,071
going to have to walk through.

2968
02:28:46,071 --> 02:28:47,640
MARISHA: Ooh, good. Smarty-pants.

2969
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:49,599
LAURA: Because they can't freaking see it right
now, can they?

2970
02:28:49,599 --> 02:28:50,565
MATT: Which way?

2971
02:28:50,565 --> 02:28:52,480
LAURA: Yeah, there, yeah.

2972
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:53,753
ASHLEY: Both sides?

2973
02:28:53,753 --> 02:28:55,914
MATT: You said Spike Growth. How much does it
affect?

2974
02:28:55,914 --> 02:29:00,732
LAURA: It affects-- damn it-- I didn't put it in
my thingy because I'm dumb. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

2975
02:29:00,732 --> 02:29:02,662
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry.

2976
02:29:02,662 --> 02:29:03,695
MATT: That's okay.

2977
02:29:03,695 --> 02:29:05,136
ORION: You're not dumb. You're a strong, smart
person.

2978
02:29:05,136 --> 02:29:06,335
ASHLEY: While she's looking, could I--

2979
02:29:06,335 --> 02:29:07,224
LAURA: Spike Growth!

2980
02:29:07,224 --> 02:29:08,285
ASHLEY: You found it.

2981
02:29:08,285 --> 02:29:09,329
TALIESIN: Way more than arrows.

2982
02:29:09,329 --> 02:29:11,863
LAURA: It is a 20-foot radius. That's not that
much.

2983
02:29:11,863 --> 02:29:14,471
MATT: Okay, cool. So you can do this whole area
right here is all spiky growth.

2984
02:29:14,471 --> 02:29:16,879
LAURA: And it's hard spikes. Hard spikes and
thorns.

2985
02:29:16,879 --> 02:29:18,049
MATT: Good to know.

2986
02:29:18,049 --> 02:29:19,463
TALIESIN: Briar.

2987
02:29:19,463 --> 02:29:24,476
SAM: All right, well, I'm going to follow suit and
go to the other side and cast Stinking Cloud. No, over--

2988
02:29:24,476 --> 02:29:25,761
MATT: Over here?

2989
02:29:25,761 --> 02:29:27,207
SAM: Over there, yeah.

2990
02:29:27,207 --> 02:29:28,626
TRAVIS: Our side's the best!

2991
02:29:28,626 --> 02:29:30,526
(laughter)

2992
02:29:30,526 --> 02:29:32,459
MATT: Go ahead and make another stealth check.

2993
02:29:32,459 --> 02:29:36,130
SAM: Okay. 15. 17!

2994
02:29:36,130 --> 02:29:37,286
MATT: 17.

2995
02:29:37,286 --> 02:29:39,822
SAM: That's the best stealth I've ever done.

2996
02:29:39,894 --> 02:29:40,634
ASHLEY: Well done.

2997
02:29:40,634 --> 02:29:41,648
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.

2998
02:29:41,648 --> 02:29:44,349
MATT: You quietly come by and mutter under your
breath your arcane ritual and all of a sudden

2999
02:29:44,349 --> 02:29:46,775
(quiet whoosh). And what was the size of the cloud
on that one?

3000
02:29:46,775 --> 02:29:55,453
SAM: 30 feet, I think? I think it's 30 feet. Hold
on, hold on, hold on. 90 feet! Oh, that's the range.

3001
02:29:55,453 --> 02:29:56,517
MATT: What's the radius?

3002
02:29:56,517 --> 02:29:57,725
SAM: It's a 20-foot radius.

3003
02:29:57,725 --> 02:29:58,789
ORION: Oh, your cards are cool!

3004
02:29:58,789 --> 02:30:00,811
MATT: 20-foot radius, which would be-- Actually, a
20-foot radius for this would be...

3005
02:30:00,811 --> 02:30:02,059
ORION: Nice, they have little bard thingies.

3006
02:30:02,059 --> 02:30:03,527
MARISHA: Oh, they're purple. Mine has like a--

3007
02:30:03,527 --> 02:30:04,377
ORION: Nice color diversity!

3008
02:30:04,377 --> 02:30:05,568
MATT: This whole area here--

3009
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:06,427
LAURA: Oh, nice!

3010
02:30:06,427 --> 02:30:07,394
ORION: (laughs) Oh, I did see this.

3011
02:30:07,394 --> 02:30:09,062
MATT: This whole area here is done.

3012
02:30:09,062 --> 02:30:10,331
MARISHA: I've got like a scythe.

3013
02:30:10,331 --> 02:30:11,228
TALIESIN: A sickle.

3014
02:30:11,228 --> 02:30:15,151
MATT: And you also now make a very nasty cloud in
this vicinity as well. This whole area is

3015
02:30:15,220 --> 02:30:17,168
completely marked off on both sides now.

3016
02:30:17,168 --> 02:30:23,073
ORION: I'd like to walk up as I see this going on.
I'm going to take out my deck of illusions. I'm

3017
02:30:23,073 --> 02:30:29,712
going to toss two cards both ways, two cards on
each side. So I'm going to do this, real quick.

3018
02:30:29,712 --> 02:30:34,230
LAURA: Question. That chamber in the center of the
room, does it go all the way to the ceiling, or is it--

3019
02:30:34,230 --> 02:30:35,948
MATT: No, there is a gap.

3020
02:30:35,948 --> 02:30:37,352
ORION: Deck of illusions, everyone.

3021
02:30:37,352 --> 02:30:40,178
LAURA: So there's a huge-- so technically, the
spiders could crawl up the ceiling and drop down

3022
02:30:40,178 --> 02:30:41,342
on us?

3023
02:30:41,342 --> 02:30:42,544
TRAVIS: Yes.

3024
02:30:42,544 --> 02:30:43,752
MATT: In theory?

3025
02:30:43,752 --> 02:30:51,657
TALIESIN: Why would you give him ideas like that?
Just feed him irony!

3026
02:30:51,873 --> 02:30:53,892
TRAVIS: Let's go.

3027
02:30:53,892 --> 02:31:00,764
ORION: Ten of Hearts, Yes! Joker, Queen of Hearts,
and another Joker! What?!

3028
02:31:00,764 --> 02:31:03,021
SAM: What does that mean?

3029
02:31:03,021 --> 02:31:04,454
MATT: Wait, you threw--

3030
02:31:04,454 --> 02:31:06,301
ORION: I put two on each side.

3031
02:31:06,301 --> 02:31:08,131
MATT: Oh, two on each side.

3032
02:31:08,131 --> 02:31:12,331
ORION: Yeah. So, like, two over in the spot before
all that mess over there and two are in the other mess.

3033
02:31:12,331 --> 02:31:14,832
ASHLEY: Do you want to go one up top, just in
case?

3034
02:31:14,832 --> 02:31:16,140
LAURA: Yeah.

3035
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:17,011
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3036
02:31:17,011 --> 02:31:17,978
ORION: So the Jokers--

3037
02:31:17,978 --> 02:31:18,937
MATT: Are you.

3038
02:31:18,937 --> 02:31:20,214
ORION: And a female version of me.

3039
02:31:20,214 --> 02:31:21,228
LAURA: Ooh, that's awesome.

3040
02:31:21,228 --> 02:31:23,199
MATT: All right, so a secondary Tiberius appears
right there.

3041
02:31:23,199 --> 02:31:25,125
ORION: (falsetto) Hello, everyone.

3042
02:31:25,125 --> 02:31:26,914
MARISHA: You know, you make a good woman.

3043
02:31:26,914 --> 02:31:27,989
ORION: (falsetto) Tiberiosa.

3044
02:31:27,989 --> 02:31:29,813
MATT: Female Tiberius appears over on that side.

3045
02:31:29,813 --> 02:31:31,436
MARISHA: Tiberiosa.

3046
02:31:31,436 --> 02:31:35,719
ORION: And then whichever side you decide, a Queen
of Hearts and Ten of Hearts.

3047
02:31:35,719 --> 02:31:37,136
MATT: Queen of Hearts-- oh, interesting.

3048
02:31:37,136 --> 02:31:39,326
TRAVIS: (falsetto) Levi-O-sa, not levio-SA.

3049
02:31:39,326 --> 02:31:41,720
MATT: A succubus appears over here. Winged.

3050
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:42,909
MARISHA: Well, that's fun.

3051
02:31:42,909 --> 02:31:44,475
MATT: Sorry, what was the other one that you
said?

3052
02:31:44,475 --> 02:31:46,145
ORION: Queen of Hearts and a Ten of Hearts.

3053
02:31:46,145 --> 02:31:49,345
MATT: Ten of Hearts. A cloud giant on this side of
the room.

3054
02:31:49,345 --> 02:31:50,491
LAURA: What?

3055
02:31:50,491 --> 02:31:51,565
ORION: (explosion noise)

3056
02:31:51,565 --> 02:31:52,556
ASHLEY: Rad.

3057
02:31:52,556 --> 02:31:55,804
MATT: We'll use that mini for now, it's fine. All
of a sudden appear, kind of translucent, their

3058
02:31:55,804 --> 02:31:59,098
image flickering. It's not a great illusion, but
it's enough where it catches some attention.

3059
02:31:59,098 --> 02:32:02,984
ORION: And they're positioned right before the
messes of each side.

3060
02:32:02,984 --> 02:32:04,279
MATT: Like right there.

3061
02:32:04,279 --> 02:32:05,541
ORION: Yeah.

3062
02:32:05,541 --> 02:32:09,987
MATT: All righty. Kima's now sitting there like,
(whispers) "Put the key in now?"

3063
02:32:09,987 --> 02:32:13,190
SAM: No, no, do it.

3064
02:32:13,190 --> 02:32:14,356
TALIESIN: Yes, yes, go.

3065
02:32:14,356 --> 02:32:15,707
MARISHA: Okay, you're good. Go for it, yeah.

3066
02:32:15,707 --> 02:32:19,387
MATT: She puts her symbol into the recess. As it
does, the stone doors shift and there's a dull

3067
02:32:19,387 --> 02:32:27,997
kind of creaking of the stone as it slides not
open, but into the walls, revealing an interior

3068
02:32:27,997 --> 02:32:41,636
that is, as the light filters in, the entirety of
the wall, floor, and ceiling of this room is of

3069
02:32:41,636 --> 02:32:47,656
the same scrolling, the same platinum/sapphire
material as the outside of the building and the

3070
02:32:47,656 --> 02:32:52,791
box that's there, except for the design seems to
all filter in towards the center, like the center

3071
02:32:52,791 --> 02:32:55,894
of a spiderweb. All the design coalesces to the
center point.

3072
02:32:55,894 --> 02:32:57,614
LAURA: Had to be a spiderweb.

3073
02:32:57,614 --> 02:33:04,385
MATT: It's not an actual spiderweb. There's a
raised dais up in the center there, about four

3074
02:33:04,385 --> 02:33:11,816
feet wide, about a half-foot thick. Kima kind of
takes her symbol and puts it back around her neck

3075
02:33:11,816 --> 02:33:18,817
and kind of motions like this. The two
Scalebearers begin to move down, carrying the

3076
02:33:18,817 --> 02:33:23,433
case, looking about the rest of you like--

3077
02:33:23,433 --> 02:33:29,761
ORION: I invisibly follow right behind the box,
still keeping my illusions in check.

3078
02:33:29,761 --> 02:33:30,960
MATT: All right.

3079
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:31,854
ASHLEY: Same, same, same.

3080
02:33:31,854 --> 02:33:32,800
MATT: Everyone holds in place?

3081
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:33,791
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not going to move far away.

3082
02:33:33,791 --> 02:33:34,604
ASHLEY: Following.

3083
02:33:34,604 --> 02:33:35,397
TRAVIS: As you will.

3084
02:33:35,397 --> 02:33:36,234
MARISHA: No, no, no, no.

3085
02:33:36,234 --> 02:33:37,202
MATT: You're staying right there?

3086
02:33:37,202 --> 02:33:41,050
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, if I held-- let me shift one
over, just so I'm not in Trinket's way. The other

3087
02:33:41,050 --> 02:33:43,295
way. Yeah.

3088
02:33:43,295 --> 02:33:55,379
MATT: There you go. All right, so. As they enter
the chamber, Kima enters as well, you guys filing

3089
02:33:55,379 --> 02:33:58,972
in behind them, I need you all to make stealth
checks.

3090
02:33:58,972 --> 02:34:00,411
TRAVIS and LAURA: Everybody?

3091
02:34:00,411 --> 02:34:03,661
MATT: No, Tiberius, with advantage, because you're
invisible.

3092
02:34:03,661 --> 02:34:04,776
LIAM: What kind of check?

3093
02:34:04,776 --> 02:34:05,727
SAM: Stealth!

3094
02:34:05,727 --> 02:34:06,595
TRAVIS: Not you.

3095
02:34:06,595 --> 02:34:07,710
MATT: Not you, don't worry about it.

3096
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:08,646
ASHLEY: I don't?

3097
02:34:08,646 --> 02:34:09,646
MATT: You do.

3098
02:34:09,646 --> 02:34:15,933
ORION: 17.

3099
02:34:15,933 --> 02:34:22,327
ASHLEY: Three.

3100
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:25,265
(laughter)

3101
02:34:25,265 --> 02:34:27,335
SAM: Clang, clang, clang.

3102
02:34:27,335 --> 02:34:33,042
MATT: So you step into the chamber, losing your
footing for a moment on the smooth, kind of

3103
02:34:33,042 --> 02:34:36,342
platinum-like ridges across the ground, and you
kind of catch yourself, your plate hitting the

3104
02:34:36,342 --> 02:34:43,673
ground with a loud (ting) sound, at which point
the two Scalebearers kind of look at you--

3105
02:34:43,673 --> 02:34:45,491
ASHLEY: (whispers) Sorry! Sorry!

3106
02:34:45,491 --> 02:34:50,580
MATT: With a heavy sigh, and Kima goes, "Go, go,
go!" They both step forward and take and place the

3107
02:34:50,580 --> 02:34:55,468
box into the center of the room on top of the
dais. As they both release the chains, the box

3108
02:34:55,468 --> 02:35:01,357
seems to levitate on its own to the center of the
room, much like how the Horn itself ascended and

3109
02:35:01,357 --> 02:35:06,628
was kept aloft in the center of the box. The box
lifts up and slowly begins to rotate on its own.

3110
02:35:06,628 --> 02:35:11,934
As it does, you can see the sapphire bits that are
ingrained on this box flash with a bright blue

3111
02:35:11,934 --> 02:35:17,499
light and all of a sudden the blue energy
spreads into the ceiling and the floor of this

3112
02:35:17,579 --> 02:35:24,375
room and all of the blue and silver veins that are
carved into this begin to glow with a similar blue

3113
02:35:24,375 --> 02:35:25,363
light.

3114
02:35:25,363 --> 02:35:26,210
SAM: Cool.

3115
02:35:26,210 --> 02:35:27,012
MARISHA: Cool.

3116
02:35:27,012 --> 02:35:28,213
ORION: I love light.

3117
02:35:28,213 --> 02:35:29,740
MATT: At which point, the doors begin to--

3118
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:30,535
SAM: Which doors?

3119
02:35:30,535 --> 02:35:32,369
MATT: The doors you guys entered this room through
begin to close.

3120
02:35:32,369 --> 02:35:33,513
SAM: Ah, we should leave.

3121
02:35:33,513 --> 02:35:34,690
ORION: I'm going to scootch.

3122
02:35:34,690 --> 02:35:38,863
MATT: Yeah, you guys immediately scootch out of
the way. Kima darts off. Both of them turn around

3123
02:35:38,863 --> 02:35:40,073
and start running back.

3124
02:35:40,073 --> 02:35:42,211
SAM: (whispers) They're going to die.

3125
02:35:42,211 --> 02:35:43,982
MATT: They both make it out.

3126
02:35:43,982 --> 02:35:45,166
ASHLEY: Oh! That's good.

3127
02:35:45,166 --> 02:35:49,018
MATT: They both manage to just squeeze through
real fast as the doors slam behind.

3128
02:35:49,018 --> 02:35:50,677
MARISHA: That would be terrifying.

3129
02:35:50,677 --> 02:35:58,590
MATT: At which point, you see a series of spiders
beginning to try to cut around-- these here,

3130
02:35:58,590 --> 02:36:00,466
what's the DC on your--

3131
02:36:00,466 --> 02:36:02,380
SAM: My spell?

3132
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:03,378
MATT: Your spell, yeah.

3133
02:36:03,378 --> 02:36:05,913
SAM: 17, because I didn't do it through the hand
cone.

3134
02:36:05,913 --> 02:36:06,641
MATT: Yeah.

3135
02:36:06,641 --> 02:36:07,675
LAURA: (whispers) Why?

3136
02:36:07,675 --> 02:36:08,697
MARISHA: Should we run?

3137
02:36:08,697 --> 02:36:12,655
MATT: Both of these spiders get disoriented and
try to find their way through the Stinking Cloud,

3138
02:36:12,655 --> 02:36:14,560
kind of like (choking, clicking noises).

3139
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,420
MARISHA: Yeah, who's going to be back down here,
theoretically.

3140
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:17,855
ORION: The guards could come back.

3141
02:36:17,855 --> 02:36:19,675
MATT: None of them make their way through. The
rest of these begin coming forward-- what's the

3142
02:36:19,675 --> 02:36:21,225
roll they have to make for the Spiky Growth?

3143
02:36:21,225 --> 02:36:22,155
LAURA: 14.

3144
02:36:22,155 --> 02:36:24,057
TALIESIN: To repair the room that we broke,
anyway.

3145
02:36:24,057 --> 02:36:26,299
MATT: 14. Both missed their save. What's the
damage on that?

3146
02:36:26,299 --> 02:36:30,192
LAURA: That's 2d4 for every five feet crossed.

3147
02:36:30,192 --> 02:36:34,735
MATT: They would probably be skittering around
here halfway through before they changed

3148
02:36:34,735 --> 02:36:37,139
trajectory, so-- 1d4, 2d4?

3149
02:36:37,139 --> 02:36:38,806
LAURA: 2d4 for every five feet.

3150
02:36:38,806 --> 02:36:44,047
MATT: So 10d4 each.

3151
02:36:44,047 --> 02:36:46,060
MARISHA: Nice!

3152
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:48,299
MATT: They come charging around the corner rapidly
(skittering noises).

3153
02:36:48,299 --> 02:36:49,800
MARISHA: 10d4? That's cool.

3154
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:51,067
ORION: Oh, nice, what?

3155
02:36:51,067 --> 02:36:52,366
MARISHA: For her thorns.

3156
02:36:52,366 --> 02:36:53,889
ORION: (whispers) Sweet, thorns.

3157
02:36:53,889 --> 02:36:59,608
MARISHA: My little sister once fell into a rose
bush.

3158
02:36:59,608 --> 02:37:00,825
SAM: Good story.

3159
02:37:00,825 --> 02:37:02,192
MARISHA: It was very painful.

3160
02:37:02,192 --> 02:37:04,162
ORION: Good story? (laughs)

3161
02:37:04,162 --> 02:37:06,535
I once fell into a fire ant hill.

3162
02:37:06,535 --> 02:37:08,907
MARISHA: That sucks, too.

3163
02:37:08,907 --> 02:37:11,660
ORION: It was very painful. I was riding my bike.
It sucked.

3164
02:37:11,660 --> 02:37:12,699
LAURA: 22.

3165
02:37:12,699 --> 02:37:17,906
MATT: 22. Both of these spiders stop in place,
looking severely messed up and damaged and just

3166
02:37:17,906 --> 02:37:22,627
kind of hold their ground, looking very confused.
You see, crawling up over the top of this

3167
02:37:22,627 --> 02:37:32,589
structure, one large white and bluish spider that
leaps up. As this is happening, you guys are

3168
02:37:32,589 --> 02:37:37,640
noticing that blue energy is cracking through the
floor and now following the pattern across the

3169
02:37:37,701 --> 02:37:40,111
entirety of the structure. It crawls up the
walls--

3170
02:37:40,111 --> 02:37:41,127
MARISHA: Oh.

3171
02:37:41,127 --> 02:37:43,685
MATT: -- and that blue energy reaches to the
ceiling and illuminates it. And what you missed

3172
02:37:43,685 --> 02:37:50,214
when you entered the room is you can see, recessed
into the ceiling of this room, four large humanoid

3173
02:37:50,214 --> 02:37:55,774
entities that are just currently held aloft,
buried in the ceiling, of platinum armor.

3174
02:37:55,774 --> 02:37:56,868
ORION: Go.

3175
02:37:56,868 --> 02:37:58,048
TRAVIS: We've got to go. We've got to go.

3176
02:37:58,048 --> 02:38:02,919
MATT: One of them suddenly flashes, dislodges, and
(whoosh, thud), squashing the spider in the

3177
02:38:03,085 --> 02:38:04,073
process.

3178
02:38:04,073 --> 02:38:05,752
(yelling)

3179
02:38:05,752 --> 02:38:06,867
MARISHA: What is that?

3180
02:38:06,867 --> 02:38:09,869
MATT: Just (spider screech, croak) screeching
sound, the spider slowly tries to curl in place,

3181
02:38:09,869 --> 02:38:15,798
the giant platinum golem now slamming on top and
squishing on top. You see as it slowly comes to

3182
02:38:15,798 --> 02:38:23,826
stand, each hand holding these giant platinum
cleavers. You suddenly hear a voice ringing

3183
02:38:23,826 --> 02:38:27,992
through your heads collectively: "Get out."

3184
02:38:27,992 --> 02:38:29,328
LAURA: (whispers) We should get out!

3185
02:38:29,328 --> 02:38:32,669
ORION: You heard the man! You heard him! You heard
him! The earrings, everybody heard him.

3186
02:38:32,669 --> 02:38:35,953
SAM: Wait, can we just leave the thing here with
the golem?

3187
02:38:35,953 --> 02:38:38,363
LAURA: Golems are meant to protect.

3188
02:38:38,363 --> 02:38:39,786
ORION: It's going to kill everything there.

3189
02:38:39,786 --> 02:38:40,784
SAM: Oh, then let's go.

3190
02:38:40,784 --> 02:38:41,740
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3191
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:44,085
MATT: All right, so all of you guys start bolting
out. I want everyone to go ahead and make a

3192
02:38:44,085 --> 02:38:45,265
dexterity check.

3193
02:38:45,265 --> 02:38:48,877
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, sure.

3194
02:38:48,877 --> 02:38:54,202
ORION: 13.

3195
02:38:54,202 --> 02:38:56,549
MATT: All right, anyone lower than a ten?

3196
02:38:56,549 --> 02:38:58,025
TRAVIS: What about on a ten?

3197
02:38:58,025 --> 02:38:58,860
MARISHA: No.

3198
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:00,618
MATT: Lower than a ten?

3199
02:39:00,618 --> 02:39:02,242
ORION: (quietly) We all got above ten?

3200
02:39:02,242 --> 02:39:03,142
MATT: Anyone?

3201
02:39:03,142 --> 02:39:04,374
All right. You as well?

3202
02:39:04,374 --> 02:39:05,185
ASHLEY: 14.

3203
02:39:05,185 --> 02:39:05,980
MATT: Awesome.

3204
02:39:05,980 --> 02:39:06,861
(laughter)

3205
02:39:06,861 --> 02:39:07,893
ORION: Even Pike!

3206
02:39:07,893 --> 02:39:10,295
MATT: You guys all come darting out of the room,
except for Kima, who rolls a one.

3207
02:39:10,295 --> 02:39:12,091
So all of you guys come running out of the
room--

3208
02:39:12,158 --> 02:39:13,090
SAM: Kima's dead.

3209
02:39:13,090 --> 02:39:14,032
MARISHA: Kima?

3210
02:39:14,032 --> 02:39:18,060
MATT: The rest of the Scalebearers come rushing
out, they're no longer encumbered by the box.

3211
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:21,807
Kima's kind of helping everyone get by, trying to
keep everyone at bay, being the hero. As she turns

3212
02:39:21,807 --> 02:39:27,984
around, the first one comes leaping off of the
structure, runs towards her and gives one giant

3213
02:39:27,984 --> 02:39:30,578
sweep with one of its blades.

3214
02:39:30,578 --> 02:39:40,245
Ooh, yeah, that'll hit. You see the blade
streak across the front of her silver armor. She

3215
02:39:40,245 --> 02:39:48,079
takes 24 points of slashing damage. It sends her
flying back ten feet with the sheer force of it,

3216
02:39:48,079 --> 02:39:53,229
but she manages to roll out of it, yeah! With an
acrobatics check, catching herself to her feet and

3217
02:39:53,229 --> 02:39:54,898
just keeps bolting behind the rest of you guys.

3218
02:39:54,898 --> 02:39:56,107
LAURA: Can I see?

3219
02:39:56,107 --> 02:40:00,270
MATT: You now see behind two more (crash, crash)
dislodging from the ceiling as the one that's

3220
02:40:00,270 --> 02:40:03,405
charging after you is coming up the stairway.
Through this, we're now going into a skill

3221
02:40:03,405 --> 02:40:04,863
challenge as you guys are rushing out.

3222
02:40:04,863 --> 02:40:05,637
LAURA: Oh, god.

3223
02:40:05,637 --> 02:40:06,560
TRAVIS: Must go faster. Must go faster.

3224
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:07,352
SAM: Skill challenge.

3225
02:40:07,352 --> 02:40:08,384
MARISHA: Skill challenge!

3226
02:40:08,384 --> 02:40:09,428
ASHLEY: Ah, go, go!

3227
02:40:09,428 --> 02:40:10,508
ORION: Yeah, all right. Run for your life.

3228
02:40:10,508 --> 02:40:11,375
MARISHA: We haven't done this in a while.

3229
02:40:11,375 --> 02:40:12,565
MATT: Now, as you're running to get through,
there's still bits of webbing still in the way. I

3230
02:40:12,565 --> 02:40:14,577
need everyone to go ahead and make another
dexterity check.

3231
02:40:14,577 --> 02:40:15,615
SAM: All right, doing good.

3232
02:40:15,615 --> 02:40:16,544
ORION: Yes!

3233
02:40:16,544 --> 02:40:17,658
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3234
02:40:17,658 --> 02:40:19,776
MARISHA: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

3235
02:40:19,776 --> 02:40:20,685
ORION: 21!

3236
02:40:20,685 --> 02:40:21,593
LAURA: 25.

3237
02:40:21,593 --> 02:40:22,409
TALIESIN: 22.

3238
02:40:22,409 --> 02:40:23,252
TRAVIS: 21.

3239
02:40:23,252 --> 02:40:24,252
LIAM: 26.

3240
02:40:24,252 --> 02:40:25,060
ASHLEY: 17?

3241
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:25,872
MARISHA: 11?

3242
02:40:25,872 --> 02:40:26,810
TALIESIN: 22.

3243
02:40:26,810 --> 02:40:27,564
MATT: All right.

3244
02:40:27,564 --> 02:40:28,553
SAM: 19.

3245
02:40:28,553 --> 02:40:34,043
MATT: All right, as you guys are all charging up,
kind of helping each other but also clamoring to

3246
02:40:34,043 --> 02:40:38,239
get through, Kima is rushing up and you can see
where one of the Scalebearers has now tripped and

3247
02:40:38,303 --> 02:40:39,451
fallen on the stairs.

3248
02:40:39,451 --> 02:40:40,445
SAM: Oh, no!

3249
02:40:40,445 --> 02:40:42,744
MATT: She runs past, leans back to reach her hand
out as the golem comes up behind--

3250
02:40:42,744 --> 02:40:43,655
MARISHA: No!

3251
02:40:43,655 --> 02:40:45,738
MATT: -- with two hands, swings down with both
blades.

3252
02:40:45,738 --> 02:40:46,885
SAM: Against Kima again?

3253
02:40:46,885 --> 02:40:48,175
MATT: No, this is against one of the
Scalebearers.

3254
02:40:48,175 --> 02:40:48,844
SAM: Oh, okay.

3255
02:40:48,844 --> 02:40:49,735
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3256
02:40:49,735 --> 02:40:50,830
LAURA: Should I be rolling for Trinket?

3257
02:40:50,830 --> 02:40:52,151
MATT: I'm considering Trinket with you, so no.

3258
02:40:52,151 --> 02:40:53,160
MARISHA: Too late, just leave them.

3259
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:54,336
LAURA: Okay, thank you.

3260
02:40:54,336 --> 02:40:57,144
MATT: We'll do that next round because I forgot.
There's a lot of things to consider. One of them

3261
02:40:57,144 --> 02:41:00,806
hits the stone and just streaks off, sparks flying
through the air, illuminating the space

3262
02:41:00,806 --> 02:41:09,705
secondarily. However, the other Scalebearer takes
28 points of slashing damage from the blow. As it

3263
02:41:09,705 --> 02:41:14,591
reaches up again for a second blow, Kima reaches
down and grabs Desona's arm and lifts her up off

3264
02:41:14,591 --> 02:41:18,217
her feet and they both go charging forward. You
guys make your way up the stairway as you see now

3265
02:41:18,217 --> 02:41:19,739
the golem pushing its way through.

3266
02:41:19,739 --> 02:41:24,779
ORION: I'm going to dissipate my card illusion and
I'm going to cast Fly on myself, so I'm hovering.

3267
02:41:24,779 --> 02:41:26,203
MATT: Okay.

3268
02:41:26,203 --> 02:41:31,790
MARISHA: How much of a gap is there between the
last trailing-behind Scalebearer and the golem?

3269
02:41:31,842 --> 02:41:36,446
MATT: Well, now that Kima's got them, they're
rushing up and there's about a ten-foot, 15-foot

3270
02:41:36,446 --> 02:41:37,251
gap now.

3271
02:41:37,251 --> 02:41:38,178
LAURA: Okay.

3272
02:41:38,178 --> 02:41:39,713
MARISHA: I'm going to turn around and do Wall of
Stone. Boof!

3273
02:41:39,713 --> 02:41:44,099
MATT: Okay. As they rush past, a wall of stone
slams up as the golem goes smashing into it--

3274
02:41:44,366 --> 02:41:47,768
ORION: I'll do support. I'll do Obelisk right
behind it, too.

3275
02:41:47,768 --> 02:41:53,530
MATT: All right. So as you guys come rushing up to
the top of this, you guys are just doing the stone

3276
02:41:53,530 --> 02:41:57,245
wall, obelisk, obelisk, obelisk. We'll say you
cast it twice to go ahead and reinforce.

3277
02:41:57,245 --> 02:41:58,806
MARISHA: Boof!

3278
02:41:58,806 --> 02:42:03,750
MATT: All right, you hear the impact from behind.
You hear stone crack and break and you see two of

3279
02:42:03,750 --> 02:42:08,766
the pillars that you put up impact, dust and bits
of rock shoot out, but it settles. Apparently it's

3280
02:42:08,766 --> 02:42:11,843
holding strong and you start hearing slamming of
some sort of heavy weight behind it.

3281
02:42:11,843 --> 02:42:13,031
MARISHA: Right, run.

3282
02:42:13,031 --> 02:42:16,402
MATT: As well as the following of additional giant
heavy footsteps. It's now got its reinforcements

3283
02:42:16,402 --> 02:42:19,166
caught up to it. You guys charge into the room
with the broken trap, which now has

3284
02:42:19,166 --> 02:42:23,049
partially raised platforms. You're rushing around
and trying to find your way through. You get to

3285
02:42:23,211 --> 02:42:26,881
the other side of the room. There's now an
entirety-- a room filled with mist in front of you.

3286
02:42:26,942 --> 02:42:28,179
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no.

3287
02:42:28,179 --> 02:42:32,875
MARISHA: I still have it. I can Gust of
Wind. That's my last 3rd-level spell.

3288
02:42:33,031 --> 02:42:35,508
MATT: Okay. All right, Gust of Wind. I'm going to
ask all of you guys to make a wisdom check as you

3289
02:42:35,508 --> 02:42:36,779
rush through.

3290
02:42:36,779 --> 02:42:37,962
MARISHA: Including me?

3291
02:42:37,962 --> 02:42:38,825
MATT: Everyone.

3292
02:42:38,825 --> 02:42:40,143
SAM: Wisdom check or saving throw?

3293
02:42:40,143 --> 02:42:41,416
MATT: This is a wisdom check.

3294
02:42:41,416 --> 02:42:45,741
MARISHA: Just adding your wisdom?

3295
02:42:45,741 --> 02:42:47,039
ASHLEY: Natural 20!

3296
02:42:47,039 --> 02:42:48,101
LAURA: What what!

3297
02:42:48,101 --> 02:42:49,058
MATT: Nice!

3298
02:42:49,058 --> 02:42:49,911
ASHLEY: 24.

3299
02:42:49,911 --> 02:42:51,673
MARISHA: Saving throw or just your ability
modifier?

3300
02:42:51,673 --> 02:42:52,462
ORION: 12.

3301
02:42:52,462 --> 02:42:53,361
MATT: Ability modifier.

3302
02:42:53,361 --> 02:42:54,271
TALIESIN: Oh.

3303
02:42:54,271 --> 02:42:55,278
MARISHA: Okay, 16.

3304
02:42:55,278 --> 02:42:56,413
ORION: I thought it was negative three.

3305
02:42:56,413 --> 02:42:58,300
SAM: Ten. Ten for me.

3306
02:42:58,300 --> 02:42:59,225
TALIESIN: 14.

3307
02:42:59,225 --> 02:43:00,302
LAURA: 13.

3308
02:43:00,302 --> 02:43:01,234
LIAM: Nine.

3309
02:43:01,234 --> 02:43:02,145
TRAVIS: Two.

3310
02:43:02,145 --> 02:43:03,230
SAM: Nine, wow.

3311
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:10,253
MATT: All of you guys are pushing through. So, as
you guys come rushing in you're like, go go! You

3312
02:43:10,253 --> 02:43:14,608
see Keyleth's focusing and getting the wind to
escape, Keyleth rushes up, Kima comes through with

3313
02:43:14,608 --> 02:43:18,025
the two Scalebearers, everyone comes through,
Grog's bringing up the back. You can see now, in

3314
02:43:18,025 --> 02:43:24,414
the back behind him, a giant blade-wielding fist
as the golem comes smashing through the wall. The

3315
02:43:24,414 --> 02:43:28,866
rest of you guys, ushering Grog along, Grog comes
running, hears the sound, looks over his shoulder

3316
02:43:28,866 --> 02:43:34,858
and in the chaos of it, his trajectory is off and
he ends up brushing into the side of the mist.

3317
02:43:34,858 --> 02:43:36,288
LAURA: Oh, no!

3318
02:43:36,288 --> 02:43:38,205
MATT: Grog, go ahead and make a dexterity saving
throw.

3319
02:43:38,205 --> 02:43:40,382
TRAVIS: 12.

3320
02:43:40,382 --> 02:43:47,381
MATT: You end up taking 24 points of fire damage
as the pillars spin, unleashing a torrent of flame.

3321
02:43:47,381 --> 02:43:49,348
TRAVIS: No, bad car wash, bad car wash!

3322
02:43:49,348 --> 02:43:51,111
MARISHA: (laughs) Bad car wash.

3323
02:43:51,111 --> 02:43:53,592
LAURA: Oh, no, Grog, your beard has been singed.

3324
02:43:53,592 --> 02:43:54,313
ORION: Oh!

3325
02:43:54,313 --> 02:43:55,269
TRAVIS: What?

3326
02:43:55,269 --> 02:43:57,590
(laughter)

3327
02:43:57,590 --> 02:44:01,991
MATT: You reach up instinctively, you feel it's as
smooth as a baby goliath's face.

3328
02:44:01,993 --> 02:44:03,300
(laughter)

3329
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:06,133
ORION: All that work!

3330
02:44:06,133 --> 02:44:08,411
MATT: As you guys charge up the rest of the
staircase--

3331
02:44:08,411 --> 02:44:10,042
ORION: Is Grog behind us now, like the furthest
away?

3332
02:44:10,042 --> 02:44:13,461
MATT: He's just caught up to you guys as you're
rushing up the staircase. You get to the final

3333
02:44:13,461 --> 02:44:19,309
door. You exit. As Kima rushes everyone through,
she brings out her holy symbol real fast, and as

3334
02:44:19,309 --> 02:44:24,578
she pulls it off her neck, you see the first golem
reach the bottom of the staircase. It begins

3335
02:44:24,578 --> 02:44:25,503
looming up--

3336
02:44:25,503 --> 02:44:26,773
ORION: We're leaving! What are you doing?!

3337
02:44:26,773 --> 02:44:29,502
MARISHA: Yeah, go home! Go home! Bad golem.

3338
02:44:29,502 --> 02:44:30,488
TALIESIN: I take a--

3339
02:44:30,488 --> 02:44:33,684
MATT: Kima takes out her holy symbol and holds it
aloft in front of her and says under her breath

3340
02:44:33,684 --> 02:44:40,505
(murmurs), at which point it begins to glow with
this extremely vibrant glow. As it does, you see a

3341
02:44:40,505 --> 02:44:46,074
symbol emblazoned on the front of the golem and it
flashes with light as it stops and just kind of

3342
02:44:46,074 --> 02:44:50,930
holds its place-- and waits. And Kima looks at the
symbol like "I wasn't sure that was going to

3343
02:44:50,930 --> 02:44:53,512
"work." She takes--

3344
02:44:53,512 --> 02:44:55,298
ORION: Tell it to go kill the spider.

3345
02:44:55,298 --> 02:45:00,199
MATT: She takes the symbol and puts it back in the
side of the stone door that originally was closed.

3346
02:45:00,199 --> 02:45:06,661
The doors slowly seal shut once again. She pulls
the symbol out-- and she falls to her knees,

3347
02:45:06,661 --> 02:45:07,956
breathing heavily.

3348
02:45:07,956 --> 02:45:09,352
SAM: Oh, Kima.

3349
02:45:09,352 --> 02:45:10,451
MARISHA: We did it!

3350
02:45:10,451 --> 02:45:11,980
TRAVIS: Next time, lead with that.

3351
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:15,439
ORION: I agree, Grog. Very well said.

3352
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:17,580
MATT: "It kind of happened very quickly, I'm
sorry."

3353
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:20,343
ASHLEY: All right, do some people need to be
healed?

3354
02:45:20,343 --> 02:45:21,347
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

3355
02:45:21,347 --> 02:45:22,255
LAURA: Yeah.

3356
02:45:22,255 --> 02:45:23,154
SAM: Kima, for sure.

3357
02:45:23,154 --> 02:45:24,000
ORION: I'm actually okay.

3358
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:24,990
MARISHA: I'm all right. I'm all right.

3359
02:45:24,990 --> 02:45:25,859
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

3360
02:45:25,859 --> 02:45:26,853
SAM: Oh, Grog's got a burnt face.

3361
02:45:26,853 --> 02:45:29,258
TRAVIS: No, I want to wear this pain as a
remembrance of my beard.

3362
02:45:29,258 --> 02:45:31,683
LAURA: You can grow it back, Grog.

3363
02:45:31,683 --> 02:45:32,867
ORION: It's okay, big fella.

3364
02:45:32,867 --> 02:45:38,199
MATT: You make your way back up to the main
chamber, where High Bearer Vord is currently

3365
02:45:38,199 --> 02:45:39,317
waiting for you.

3366
02:45:39,317 --> 02:45:40,375
SAM: Oh, this guy.

3367
02:45:40,375 --> 02:45:47,186
MATT: He turns to you as you enter. "So I am to
assume that your journey was a success?"

3368
02:45:47,186 --> 02:45:53,582
ORION: Yes, surprisingly so. It went off without a
hitch. Well, no.

3369
02:45:53,582 --> 02:45:55,362
LAURA: You've got some good security down there.

3370
02:45:55,362 --> 02:45:56,462
MARISHA: Very good.

3371
02:45:56,462 --> 02:46:00,457
MATT: "I told you. Once it's instilled, it will be
safe."

3372
02:46:00,457 --> 02:46:02,825
LAURA: A little warning next time would be great.

3373
02:46:02,825 --> 02:46:04,454
ASHLEY: 25 points of healing.

3374
02:46:04,454 --> 02:46:05,756
MATT: There you go.

3375
02:46:05,756 --> 02:46:07,402
ORION: You're really a girl on fire now.

3376
02:46:07,402 --> 02:46:09,220
MARISHA: That really heals me up, then.

3377
02:46:09,220 --> 02:46:11,221
TALIESIN: That will top me off very nicely.

3378
02:46:11,221 --> 02:46:12,516
MARISHA: I'll take that.

3379
02:46:12,516 --> 02:46:15,392
ORION: Well done, everyone, by the way.

3380
02:46:15,392 --> 02:46:16,566
LAURA: Yeah.

3381
02:46:16,566 --> 02:46:17,641
TALIESIN: That could've gone worse.

3382
02:46:17,641 --> 02:46:18,898
MARISHA: It could have gone worse.

3383
02:46:19,038 --> 02:46:25,381
MATT: At which point, the High Bearer Vord kind of
raises his hand. "Yonn, if you do not mind." And

3384
02:46:25,381 --> 02:46:26,924
Yonn kind of shuffles forward.

3385
02:46:26,924 --> 02:46:27,775
SAM: Yonn.

3386
02:46:27,775 --> 02:46:29,167
ORION: Such a bore.

3387
02:46:29,167 --> 02:46:30,191
MARISHA: Yawn.

3388
02:46:30,191 --> 02:46:31,871
MATT: "Excuse me, I'm right here."

3389
02:46:31,871 --> 02:46:35,081
ORION: It was a play on words. Your name also
means something that you do when you're tired.

3390
02:46:35,081 --> 02:46:37,234
MARISHA: Yeah!

3391
02:46:37,234 --> 02:46:39,016
MATT: "I don't like you."

3392
02:46:39,016 --> 02:46:40,228
(laughter)

3393
02:46:40,228 --> 02:46:42,127
MATT: He reaches out and puts a big old sack of
coins in your hands.

3394
02:46:42,191 --> 02:46:45,206
LAURA: Oh! I'll hold onto that.

3395
02:46:45,206 --> 02:46:46,297
ORION: Of course.

3396
02:46:46,297 --> 02:46:49,228
TALIESIN: We should mention, you may have to have
one of the rooms repaired.

3397
02:46:49,389 --> 02:46:50,640
ORION: I take a couple out.

3398
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:54,191
TALIESIN: The spinning column--

3399
02:46:54,191 --> 02:46:56,307
SAM: Circle of death.

3400
02:46:56,307 --> 02:46:57,436
LAURA: Yeah.

3401
02:46:57,436 --> 02:46:58,775
TALIESIN: May have gotten--

3402
02:46:58,775 --> 02:47:03,260
LAURA: A little broken. We thought were maybe just
disarming it but I think we probably broke it.

3403
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:04,618
TALIESIN: We put an arrow into it.

3404
02:47:04,618 --> 02:47:07,757
TRAVIS: (tearfully) If you find the remnants of a
glorious beard, preserve it.

3405
02:47:07,757 --> 02:47:09,435
LAURA: Oh, Grog, actually--

3406
02:47:09,435 --> 02:47:10,572
TRAVIS: What?

3407
02:47:10,572 --> 02:47:13,186
LAURA: I've got some remnants of a lovely beard.

3408
02:47:13,237 --> 02:47:15,320
And I try to smush it onto his chin.

3409
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:17,075
TRAVIS: It is not the same.

3410
02:47:17,075 --> 02:47:18,443
MATT: It is not the same.

3411
02:47:18,443 --> 02:47:19,843
LAURA: It looks pretty good.

3412
02:47:19,843 --> 02:47:20,929
MATT: It is not the same.

3413
02:47:20,929 --> 02:47:22,019
LAURA: Dang it.

3414
02:47:22,019 --> 02:47:29,872
MATT: At which point, the High Bearer turns to
you, Pike. "Mighty cleric, I see this meeting,

3415
02:47:29,872 --> 02:47:36,267
"though it escaped my vision before, that you bear
the holy sigil of the Dawnflower, the Lady of

3416
02:47:36,317 --> 02:47:43,718
"Redemption Herself. While we may walk under
different stars, I offer these words that caught

3417
02:47:43,718 --> 02:47:50,772
"my ear naught but a week ago. In an excavation
beneath the toppled tower of Syrac, the

3418
02:47:50,772 --> 02:47:57,254
"long-cursed ruin that sat like a blemish upon this
city for hundreds of years, it was revealed that

3419
02:47:57,254 --> 02:48:04,750
"perhaps the five holy paths that began here at
Vasselheim, there may indeed now be a sixth."

3420
02:48:04,750 --> 02:48:06,285
SAM: What?

3421
02:48:06,285 --> 02:48:13,077
MATT: "A forgotten temple to Sarenrae has been
uncovered. Crumbled, lost, and without light, it

3422
02:48:13,077 --> 02:48:19,637
"sat, forever and a day, and few are around in this
city of her guiding flame to recover and restore

3423
02:48:19,637 --> 02:48:23,142
"its glory. Perhaps you should look into it."

3424
02:48:23,142 --> 02:48:26,209
ASHLEY: I will gladly look into it.

3425
02:48:26,209 --> 02:48:31,740
MATT: "The ruin lies to the west of here, at the
base of the city's mountain. Look for the dark

3426
02:48:31,740 --> 02:48:38,762
"stone ruin. Nevertheless, I thank you for your
time. Kima, if you wouldn't mind, we have some

3427
02:48:38,762 --> 02:48:40,506
"things to discuss as well."

3428
02:48:40,506 --> 02:48:43,577
MARISHA: Oh, quick, Vorg--

3429
02:48:43,577 --> 02:48:48,249
MATT: "Vord. High Bearer Vord."

3430
02:48:48,249 --> 02:48:49,231
MARISHA: Vord.

3431
02:48:49,231 --> 02:48:50,306
TALIESIN: Vord.

3432
02:48:50,306 --> 02:48:51,450
LAURA: Highbearer Vord.

3433
02:48:51,450 --> 02:48:52,773
MATT: "Was that so hard? Yes?"

3434
02:48:52,773 --> 02:49:03,932
MARISHA: Vord? You wouldn't have happened to hear
of maybe a druid tribe called the Fire Ashari?

3435
02:49:03,932 --> 02:49:11,887
They call their little hometown Pyrah. Do you
happen to know, maybe?

3436
02:49:11,887 --> 02:49:19,657
MATT: He gives you a keen look and says, "There
has been talk of a rogue band of druids, not more

3437
02:49:19,719 --> 02:49:25,722
"than two day's travel, in the-- let's see, where
did I put the maps here?" He thinks to himself for

3438
02:49:25,722 --> 02:49:33,964
a moment, considering it. "Towards the Sunder Peak
Mountain Range. Dangerous territory, fraught with

3439
02:49:33,964 --> 02:49:38,072
"volcanic activity. Yet these folks seem to call
it home."

3440
02:49:38,127 --> 02:49:43,884
MARISHA: Is Sunder Peak like west or east to where
we--

3441
02:49:43,884 --> 02:49:46,335
MATT: "Southwest of the city. It's hard to miss."

3442
02:49:46,335 --> 02:49:47,475
MARISHA: Southwest.

3443
02:49:47,475 --> 02:49:50,017
MATT: "Look for the plumes of sulfurous smoke."

3444
02:49:50,017 --> 02:49:52,473
LAURA: Is the temple to Sarenrae on the way to
the--

3445
02:49:52,473 --> 02:49:56,323
MATT: "The temple to Sarenrae is on the same
mountain that this temple is built on."

3446
02:49:56,323 --> 02:49:57,383
LAURA: Oh.

3447
02:49:57,383 --> 02:49:59,356
MATT: "To the west of here. Follow the mountain
base."

3448
02:49:59,356 --> 02:50:01,246
MARISHA: Oh. So we can stop there first?

3449
02:50:01,246 --> 02:50:03,131
ORION: Yes, it's close, it seems.

3450
02:50:03,131 --> 02:50:04,759
LAURA: All of us can--

3451
02:50:04,759 --> 02:50:14,984
ORION: Before we part, you seem to be quite
learned about many things that I am not. Have you

3452
02:50:14,984 --> 02:50:22,157
ever heard of anything called the God's Hammer or
the Pale Stone? Or any particular artifact, Ropes

3453
02:50:22,157 --> 02:50:24,621
of Mercy, perhaps?

3454
02:50:24,621 --> 02:50:26,686
MATT: "I can't say I have, unfortunately."

3455
02:50:26,686 --> 02:50:27,830
ORION: Of course.

3456
02:50:27,830 --> 02:50:30,422
MATT: "But I shall keep this in mind, should the
information come my way."

3457
02:50:30,422 --> 02:50:32,710
ORION: Thank you. I bow.

3458
02:50:32,710 --> 02:50:43,638
MATT: He gives you a look, a quick glance, and
notes: "For the record, while your color is not

3459
02:50:43,638 --> 02:50:52,589
"what it was when you first entered, know that the
great Platinum Dragon sees through this guise to

3460
02:50:52,589 --> 02:50:54,427
"the heart beneath."

3461
02:50:54,427 --> 02:51:00,099
ORION: Yes, thank you for noticing. I agree with
the same sentiment. And I bow in the Draconic

3462
02:51:00,099 --> 02:51:01,891
fashion.

3463
02:51:01,891 --> 02:51:09,007
MATT: "Well, Kima. Business. Thank you all very
much." And he kind of lends his hands out. As he

3464
02:51:09,007 --> 02:51:13,129
extends his hand, the doors on the opposite side of
the room open up.

3465
02:51:13,192 --> 02:51:15,710
LAURA: Magic. Thought it was banned.

3466
02:51:15,710 --> 02:51:19,708
MATT: For the sake of brevity, because we have
people who have to leave on this, very soon, it

3467
02:51:19,708 --> 02:51:27,461
doesn't take you long to find your way across the
city. You find some of the city's Bastions

3468
02:51:27,461 --> 02:51:33,213
standing guard on the outskirts of this crumpled
tower ruin. It's like, black and soot-covered

3469
02:51:33,213 --> 02:51:39,361
stone that looks like a plot of land that has been
left untouched. Like, once it fell, no one wanted

3470
02:51:39,361 --> 02:51:44,161
anything to do with it. You speak with the
Bastions and they eventually let you through,

3471
02:51:44,161 --> 02:51:51,462
especially given the aid of those you've walked
with since arrival. You come to the ruin and you

3472
02:51:51,462 --> 02:51:57,211
can see there's about a 40-foot gap in this pile
of stone that is a recess in the ground, almost

3473
02:51:57,211 --> 02:52:03,005
like a small sinkhole. It looks like there is some
sort of excavation that has been set here. Very

3474
02:52:03,005 --> 02:52:08,406
haphazard. There is very simple wood boards that
have been placed into the side of this small

3475
02:52:08,406 --> 02:52:16,939
sinkhole to allow relatively comfortable, though a bit
rickety, descent into the structure. As you make

3476
02:52:17,004 --> 02:52:22,705
your way down, your eyes adjust to the little bit
of daylight that spills into this dark

3477
02:52:22,705 --> 02:52:31,076
subterranean cavern. There before you, you see a
surprisingly glorious sight: a simple structure of

3478
02:52:31,076 --> 02:52:38,347
brass and polished limestone, ancient as the day
is long. One of the walls has partially collapsed,

3479
02:52:38,347 --> 02:52:44,239
and you see what looks like three figures
rummaging through the debris. An older human

3480
02:52:44,239 --> 02:52:48,762
woman, who is being helped by two others: a young
man of blond hair and simple clothes and an older

3481
02:52:48,762 --> 02:52:54,398
gnome that's carrying a crutch under his arm.
They're all in the process of collecting and

3482
02:52:54,398 --> 02:53:01,262
setting aside and cleaning up various things that
have been recovered from this temple. You

3483
02:53:01,262 --> 02:53:10,314
immediately see against the brass structure the
very simplified symbol of the wings of Sarenrae,

3484
02:53:10,314 --> 02:53:17,850
multiple times across the structure in various
incarnations. This is very much indeed a lost

3485
02:53:17,850 --> 02:53:19,414
temple of Sarenrae.

3486
02:53:19,414 --> 02:53:21,234
LAURA: (whispers) Wow, Pike.

3487
02:53:21,234 --> 02:53:22,795
ASHLEY: (whispers) Wow.

3488
02:53:22,795 --> 02:53:27,128
SAM: So, when you've fully excavated it, you can
come back and check it out.

3489
02:53:27,297 --> 02:53:28,218
ASHLEY: Yes...

3490
02:53:28,218 --> 02:53:31,626
ORION: Or you can stay here and restore it.

3491
02:53:31,626 --> 02:53:36,326
MATT: At which point, the older woman sees you
guys walk down and says, "Please! There's nothing

3492
02:53:36,326 --> 02:53:40,129
"to take. Nothing but history and rock, I guarantee
you. Bandits are not welcome here."

3493
02:53:40,129 --> 02:53:44,370
ASHLEY: No no no! I take out my symbol and I say,
no no no, I'm here to help.

3494
02:53:44,370 --> 02:53:52,635
MATT: You can hear an audible gasp from her. She
says, "My eyes don't deceive. Oh my, I am sorry.

3495
02:53:52,635 --> 02:54:00,250
"My name is Gesyra, a simple painter, but one of,
as far as I know, the three devoted to the Lady of

3496
02:54:00,456 --> 02:54:09,399
"the Everlight here in Vasselheim. And now a
fourth. I don't know where you came from, but

3497
02:54:09,463 --> 02:54:17,213
"would you stay with us for a bit and help us
rebuild? Bring her name into the light amongst the

3498
02:54:17,213 --> 02:54:21,107
"others here in Vasselheim? Restore it to its
glory?"

3499
02:54:21,107 --> 02:54:28,726
ASHLEY: (tearfully) Yes. Oh, man, I don't want to
leave you guys.

3500
02:54:28,726 --> 02:54:34,952
MATT: "It shouldn't take long, especially with
your help. And we can bring the light into the

3501
02:54:34,952 --> 02:54:39,186
"heart of others." And you can see the two other
kind of joined her at the side and they all look at you with

3502
02:54:39,186 --> 02:54:43,150
this look of hope that you can probably tell from
the crinkles in their face they haven't had in

3503
02:54:43,213 --> 02:54:49,152
quite some time. And they look up to you in their
simple clothes as the first true strong bastion

3504
02:54:49,152 --> 02:54:56,297
for Sarenrae that they've seen in a long time.
With that, Pike, you get to turn to the rest of

3505
02:54:56,297 --> 02:54:57,971
the group.

3506
02:54:57,971 --> 02:55:07,514
ASHLEY: Well, I think this is a pilgrimage I have
to take. So, Vox Machina, keep your eyes out. I

3507
02:55:07,514 --> 02:55:18,800
will contact you every once in a while if I can,
and we will meet up once this is completed. All in.

3508
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:20,706
TRAVIS: Right.

3509
02:55:20,706 --> 02:55:24,219
ASHLEY: Vox Machina on three. One, two, three.

3510
02:55:24,219 --> 02:55:26,717
ALL: Vox Machina.

3511
02:55:26,717 --> 02:55:29,872
ORION: (tearfully) You will be missed very much,
Pike.

3512
02:55:29,872 --> 02:55:32,479
ASHLEY: I'm going to miss you guys very much.

3513
02:55:32,479 --> 02:55:39,661
MATT: And on that note, we have to close because
people are in a rush. Yeah, Ashley will be leaving

3514
02:55:39,661 --> 02:55:44,502
us for a time. She's going to New York for a few
months to shoot a web-- a television series.

3515
02:55:44,502 --> 02:55:45,877
(laughter)

3516
02:55:45,877 --> 02:55:47,439
SAM: A little web series.

3517
02:55:47,502 --> 02:55:53,510
MATT: A wonderful television series she has
recurring. We're really happy and proud of her--

3518
02:55:53,510 --> 02:55:56,186
we're just a jumble of emotions under the
circumstances.

3519
02:55:56,186 --> 02:56:01,040
ASHLEY: You guys have been so amazing and have
made this experience even better for us, and thank

3520
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:07,543
you so much for going with us on our journey. It
will keep going, but I will be back when I can.

3521
02:56:07,543 --> 02:56:08,510
ORION: You will be back.

3522
02:56:08,510 --> 02:56:09,358
LAURA: You'll be back.

3523
02:56:09,358 --> 02:56:10,286
TALIESIN: You'll be back.

3524
02:56:10,286 --> 02:56:11,232
ORION: She will be back.

3525
02:56:11,232 --> 02:56:12,344
ASHLEY: But it might be a long time.

3526
02:56:12,344 --> 02:56:15,194
MATT: Yeah, she'll pop in and out if she can, and
there will eventually be a return of Pike, but for

3527
02:56:15,194 --> 02:56:18,939
the time being she feels the calling to stay and
help rebuild this temple of Sarenrae.

3528
02:56:18,939 --> 02:56:20,904
MARISHA: We're going to miss you, Pike.

3529
02:56:20,904 --> 02:56:22,468
ASHLEY: I'm going to miss you guys.

3530
02:56:22,468 --> 02:56:24,432
MARISHA: But we understand personal journeys.

3531
02:56:24,432 --> 02:56:25,701
ASHLEY: Personal journey.

3532
02:56:25,701 --> 02:56:28,231
TRAVIS: You have a good time.

3533
02:56:28,231 --> 02:56:29,903
ASHLEY: I will.

3534
02:56:29,903 --> 02:56:37,158
SAM: Pike, I, Scanlan, will not physically wait
for you, but emotionally--

3535
02:56:37,158 --> 02:56:39,221
(laughter)

3536
02:56:39,221 --> 02:56:47,015
SAM: Emotionally I will wait for you, and I will
not stray emotionally. I will always be there for

3537
02:56:47,015 --> 02:56:48,463
you emotionally.

3538
02:56:48,463 --> 02:56:49,466
ASHLEY: Okay, Scanlan.

3539
02:56:49,466 --> 02:56:51,866
SAM: But physically, I mean, come on, it's going
to be months.

3540
02:56:51,866 --> 02:56:57,468
MATT: Thank you so much, Ash. We're going to
miss you but we'll tabs and we'll have you back soon.

3541
02:56:57,671 --> 02:56:58,513
ASHLEY: Okay.

3542
02:56:58,513 --> 02:57:02,736
MATT: All right. Thank you all so much for
watching. Everyone give Ashley love on the

3543
02:57:02,736 --> 02:57:04,071
Twitter, on the internet.

3544
02:57:04,071 --> 02:57:05,208
TRAVIS: Good going, Ashley!

3545
02:57:05,208 --> 02:57:11,253
MATT: And we'll see you guys at Comic-Con next
week. Those that'll be at Anime Expo, I'll be

3546
02:57:11,253 --> 02:57:12,897
there tomorrow for a couple of panels.

3547
02:57:12,897 --> 02:57:14,505
ZAC: Buy those shirts!

3548
02:57:14,505 --> 02:57:15,677
SAM: Oh, yeah, buy the shirts.

3549
02:57:15,677 --> 02:57:18,235
MATT: Six more days for the Critical Role shirts
before they go away.

3550
02:57:18,281 --> 02:57:20,378
LAURA: Hey, it's still got Pike on it, you gotta
get it now.

3551
02:57:20,378 --> 02:57:21,268
ALL: Yeah.

3552
02:57:21,268 --> 02:57:22,382
SAM: Collector's edition.

3553
02:57:22,382 --> 02:57:23,984
ASHLEY: Definitely limited edition.

3554
02:57:23,984 --> 02:57:27,147
MATT: All right, guys, thank you and have a
wonderful evening, we've got to let these guys go.

3555
02:57:27,147 --> 02:57:31,899
We'll see you-- me and Marisha will see you in
three weeks.

3556
02:57:31,899 --> 02:57:34,103
ORION: See us at Comic-Con.

3557
02:57:34,103 --> 02:57:36,181
MARISHA: We'll see you at Comic-Con.

3558
02:57:36,181 --> 02:57:38,501
MATT: The others will see you in two. All right.
Have a wonderful night, guys.
