00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:03,948
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:09,685
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight, picking up from a

3
00:00:09,685 --> 00:00:14,615
crazy episode last week, we have Percy among us
still.

4
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:19,580
TALIESIN: Hi! Ugh, my product!

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,511
MATT: We'll get through a few announcements. One,
apparently this is the night where we all wear the

6
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:31,740
same shirt, because that happened. Also, three of
us may have gone to a CHVRCHES concert on Monday

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,978
and are obsessed with them, so there's that.
Anyway. Let's jump in here. First and foremost,

8
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:42,436
tonight is our fantastic sponsor returning as
often as they do and thank you so much, Loot Crate!

9
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:44,808
(cheering)

10
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:50,754
SAM: Loot Crate. The theme of this month is
horror. I've been dabbling in the hip-hop world

11
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:58,391
lately, so I prepared a little rap. It's pretty
street, guys.

12
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:03,034
LAURA: Oh no! No, you are not doing that right
now!

13
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:08,653
SAM: It's going to be pretty hardcore, so buckle
up. Maestro, I need a track.

14
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:13,841
[hip-hop music]

15
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:22,104
SAM: A little louder. Got to feel a jam here. My
name is MC Sammy, and I'm here to say, I love Loot

16
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:28,873
Crate in a major way. Their boxes are fly and full
of loot. You'll feel real dope and that's no bull

17
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:37,952
shoot! Yeah! (record scratch) I'm funky fresh, a
real hip-hopper and we got a discount to save you

18
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:44,000
some copper. If you use our code you can save
three bucks! And if you don't, I don't give a fu--

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,599
beatbox break down. (beat boxing)

20
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,138
(laughter)

21
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:52,873
SAM: There's more.

22
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,845
TRAVIS: I have the hiccups!

23
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:59,098
SAM: So in conclus-- oh.

24
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:03,548
(laughter)

25
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:14,529
SAM: So in conclusion, listen up, G, I'm down with
Loot Crate and with OPP. Their swag is the bomb,

26
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:19,236
and their threads rocks. You want horror? It's in
the box! Word!

27
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:22,523
LAURA: Wow!

28
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:25,513
MATT: Thank you, Sam!

29
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:26,499
SAM: Sure.

30
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:27,942
LAURA: That made me sweat.

31
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:32,166
SAM: Man. That went really well.

32
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,993
MATT: That did not at all send hip-hop back to
1991.

33
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:41,855
MARISHA: I think I saw that in my D.A.R.E. class.

34
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:47,009
(laughter)

35
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:54,483
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate, for allowing us, week
after week, to have Sam do this. Thank you. Thank

36
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:55,653
you, Sam.

37
00:02:55,653 --> 00:03:00,949
SAM: Also, lootcrate.com/criticalrole now goes to
a custom Critical Role page within lootcrate.com,

38
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,752
and you should check it out. Love you all. Word to
your mama.

39
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,599
(laughter)

40
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,959
MATT: All righty! Next up on the list.

41
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,698
LIAM: I knew this episode would start in tears.

42
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:15,899
(laughter)

43
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:20,845
MATT: It hasn't even started yet! Laura, do you
want to talk about merch stuff coming up here?

44
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,321
LAURA: Merch stuff coming up?

45
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:24,754
MATT: Preorders are still going?

46
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:28,619
LAURA: Yeah, preorders for the hoodies are still
going on, aren't they? How about that, guys?

47
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:34,958
They're still happening. You can still order those
for I think a whole other week. No? Am I wrong?

48
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,231
I'm stroking out so hard. For another week!

49
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:43,117
MARISHA: Continuing the 1991 trend.

50
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:50,531
MATT: All right. The next thing we want to
mention, as 'tis the season of Halloween, we are

51
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,457
announcing tonight, leading up to the end of the
month, we're having a Critical Role Halloween

52
00:03:54,457 --> 00:04:01,343
costume contest. If any of you guys are dressing
up as anything Critical Role related whatsoever,

53
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:06,700
go ahead and tweet it at us or Instagram it at us
with the hashtag #CriticalCostumes. Together, one

54
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,007
word. #CriticalCostumes. We'll have a winner and a
runner-up. Prizes are to be determined. Sam is

55
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:15,221
dead-set on giving away a bunch of his old shirts.
That might be one of them. We'll figure it out.

56
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,985
TALIESIN: It's going to be a Halloween treat.

57
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:19,599
LAURA: We don't know what we're doing yet.

58
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,540
MARISHA: No. I also didn't tell Geek and Sundry we
were doing this.

59
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,090
MATT: This isn't a Geek and Sundry contest. This is
our contest. We are doing this with you guys.

60
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,866
We'll be figuring out prizes. Yeah.
#CriticalCostumes. You'll have to the end of the

61
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:38,817
month up until Halloween proper. We shall
determine a winner and runner-up. Excited to see

62
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,298
what you guys do.

63
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:46,008
Laura and Travis, you want to talk about another
episode of another project you guys are working on?

64
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:51,850
TRAVIS: I will! We're both in Telltale's the
Batman series, which is great. Laura plays

65
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,728
Catwoman. I play Harvey Dent. Episode two released
last week or the week before. I think it was last

66
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:02,905
week. It's really great. It's on major consoles,
PS4, Xbox One. You can get it on your phone now,

67
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:11,781
too, so check it out and watch us be a part of the
Batman rogues' gallery. Yeah. And save Harvey Dent.

68
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:14,875
Don't worry about Catwoman. She's a piece of cat
poop.

69
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,547
MATT: There you have it.

70
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,699
LIAM: That's a line straight from the game!

71
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,207
TRAVIS: You can look forward to that kind of
writing.

72
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:28,673
LAURA: In addition, though, to Batman: The
Telltale Series, Gears of War is launching on the

73
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:35,383
11th. We just did a big live event yesterday.
Gears of War 4. If you got the Ultimate Edition,

74
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:39,631
you can download it and you can play it early. As
in, tonight. Which, you shouldn't do. You should

75
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,650
be watching us. But you could do it after you're
done watching us.

76
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,434
TRAVIS: It's pretty sweet. I played it a bunch.
It's really great.

77
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:46,847
MATT: That's fantastic.

78
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,803
MARISHA and TALIESIN: War harder.

79
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:55,460
MATT: Other couple of announcements. Really
amazing isometric RPG that me and few of you guys

80
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,683
have worked on. Liam, you worked on it. Sam, did
you work on Masquerada?

81
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:58,643
SAM: Which?

82
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,776
MATT: Masquerada?

83
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,525
SAM: Nope!

84
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:05,503
MATT: Nope! Me and Liam worked on Masquerada. It
came out last week on Steam, and I believe it will

85
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:11,053
be available on consoles later in the year. It's a
great story, incredibly well-written, fantastic cast.

86
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,315
LIAM: Matt is very fancy in it.

87
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:20,218
MATT: Yes! I highly recommend it. I'm really proud
of the game. If you like really good narrative

88
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:24,829
stories and great character development, I highly
recommend it. Check out Masquerada on Steam.

89
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:28,542
Coming up towards the end of this month, too,
Titanfall 2.

90
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,910
LAURA: Your trailer looks so good!

91
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:39,987
MATT: I play the protagonist in the single-player
mode. You should check it out. You get to have a

92
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:45,788
fun buddy cop experience with me and your titan.
Check that out in a few weeks, guys.

93
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:50,910
LIAM: That's all I'm allowed to say. I also play a
guy. Yeah. Okay. That's it.

94
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,982
LAURA: That's as far it gets right now.

95
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:57,004
TRAVIS: We're basically in all the video games,
you guys.

96
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:59,073
SAM: I'm not in that one, apparently.

97
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:00,584
TALIESIN: Apparently not.

98
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:12,953
SAM: Yeah, well, Matt, are you in Blue Robot 13?
Yeah. Are you in Verdant Lightning? Yeah.

99
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:14,374
LAURA: Are those real games?

100
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:15,616
SAM: No, they're not real.

101
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:20,569
TALIESIN: They could've been, though. I was
nodding like, yeah, Verdant Lightning. I have that.

102
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:26,358
MATT: Couple of other quick announcements. Me and
Taliesin, not this weekend but the weekend after,

103
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:31,426
will be in New Hampshire at Another Anime Con.
We'll be doing panels and signings and fun stuff

104
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:37,473
there. Those of you guys in that vicinity, come
say hello to us. Bring things and books to sign

105
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:42,620
and bring questions for our panels, because we
will be lonely otherwise. (German accent) And it

106
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,957
would be a great time to meet you, and make your
way to Another Anime Convention. We'll see you there.

107
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,115
TALIESIN: (German accent) We'll be doing these
accents--

108
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:52,348
SAM: That's your New Hampshire accent?

109
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:56,639
MATT: (German accent) That's what they sound like
in New Hampshire, is that correct? (normal voice)

110
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,588
Last but not least, guys, please don't forget to
vote.

111
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,583
TALIESIN: Register!

112
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,575
LAURA: Register to vote! You've still got some
time.

113
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,095
MARISHA: And then vote.

114
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:10,916
MATT: Deadlines for most states are coming up
pretty soon. California has until October 24th as

115
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:17,098
the deadline to register. Please register so you
can go out and vote. It's so important, you guys.

116
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:23,098
Oh my god. Seriously, we're living in an Orwellian
fantasy right now. Please vote.

117
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,557
MARISHA: We'll be there, waiting in lines at
public schools just like everybody else.

118
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:31,004
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to come to the line that
you would go to if you vote because we know which

119
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:34,786
ones you're going to be at. We'll shake your hand.
We're going to be there for each one of you.

120
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:37,367
Individually. Like Santa Claus.

121
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,386
MATT: Travis will be there at each individual one
at the speed of light.

122
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,444
TALIESIN: My voting center actually has a tank out
front that's a National Guard center that we play

123
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:47,196
on the tank. There'll be a picture of me with a
tank later.

124
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:48,121
MARISHA: That's cool!

125
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:49,541
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's nice.

126
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:56,179
MATT: Unless we have any other announcements, I
think it's time to bring us down to tonight's

127
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,799
episode of Critical Role.

128
00:08:58,799 --> 00:10:34,860
[dramatic music]

129
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,932
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So! Picking up
where we last left off. Vox Machina, our band of

130
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,050
adventurers, had been collecting the Vestiges of
Divergence, a series of artifacts to prepare for

131
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,985
their coming encounter with Thordak the Cinder
King and the rest of the Chroma Conclave, a group

132
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:55,241
of evil, ancient dragons that banded together to
tear across and dominate the Tal'Dorei

133
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,289
countryside.

134
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:03,186
During their most recent journey, they were
tailing a competitive group searching for these

135
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:08,924
same artifacts led by a forgotten villain of the
past known as Dr. Ripley. They were led into a

136
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:13,540
trap, and a heavy battle took place, one that
claimed the life of Percival. The party retrieved

137
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:20,790
his body, took it back to Whitestone, and through
a series of very lucky rolls and imploring his

138
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,624
soul to return, once freeing it from the devouring
jaws of Orthax the shadow demon, he was restored

139
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:27,716
to life.

140
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:33,408
Celebration was short-lived thus far. After an
evening's rest, they were asked by their old ally,

141
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:38,480
Seeker Asum, to meet them upstairs in Castle
Whitestone in the war room for a very important

142
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,139
meeting. Upon arriving around the central table,
Asum revealed himself to actually be Raishan, the

143
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,449
green dragon and member of the Chroma Conclave
that you had not seen since the original attack on

144
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:58,647
Emon, and left you last with the bombshell and bit
of information that Raishan's here to make an

145
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:05,289
alliance and as you are, as well, Raishan is
interested in the destruction and downfall of

146
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,317
Thordak, the Cinder King.

147
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:17,762
And that's where we're going to pick up. Having
just revealed through the somewhat transformed

148
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:26,973
eyebrows, eyes, and upper face of the hairless,
tattooed and scarred side head of Seeker Asum, you

149
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:31,620
can see the reptilian green scales billow out and
become glowing yellowish reptilian eyes peeking

150
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:41,944
through. The voice modulates into more of a
deeper, but thin, reedy hiss after Asum looks to

151
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:57,097
you all as Raishan and says, "I wish to kill the
Cinder King. Now, do you accept my alliance?"

152
00:12:57,097 --> 00:13:02,720
LAURA: That's it? We're just supposed to trust
you?

153
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,535
MATT: "No! I assumed you'd ask questions. I'm an
open book. What do you require?"

154
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:13,183
LIAM: Why in the fuck should we trust you?

155
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:20,611
MATT: "You shouldn't, to be perfectly honest. I am
a being that rides the line between what's true

156
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:28,580
"and what's false, and I know your research has
spoken the same. However, strange circumstances

157
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:36,892
"make for strange bedfellows. And circumstances as
they are, I think you have very little choice, as

158
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:38,479
"do I."

159
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,572
LIAM: What do you claim your motives to be?

160
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:48,412
MATT: "Listen for a moment, and I'll tell you a
bit about the history of this green dragon before you.

161
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:57,873
"My home is south of here within the jungles of
the Rifenmist Peninsula along the southern side of

162
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:05,476
"the Stormcrest. That is where I met the Cinder
King nearly two decades ago. He encroached upon my

163
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:18,808
"territory. We battled then, an exhausting struggle
over days. Thordak is keen of eye, however, and

164
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:30,399
"older than I. He held his assault. He saw me, and
he saw my disease.

165
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:39,346
"I was cursed a half-century ago, when I
infiltrated and toppled a temple of Melora that

166
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:46,356
"was being built by a high druid for her roving
peons. As I consumed her last follower, broke the

167
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:54,968
"druid upon her altar, she gave her dying breath to
spite me. This sickness that she imparted was

168
00:14:54,968 --> 00:15:02,890
"merely an inconvenience, but as the years wore on,
it spread and worsened.

169
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:11,355
"I left my pursuits of base interests and began to
obsess over a cure for this before it took me. I

170
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:19,802
"burned through servant after servant to find
<i>anything</i> on such a disease. Everything failed.

171
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:23,210
"<i>Everything.</i>

172
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:37,986
"Thordak somehow noted and recognized my ailment.
He said, 'You are unwell. A rare malady upon you.

173
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:49,159
"'It will claim you, in time. However, I've traveled
the world, I've gathered many secrets, and I know

174
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:56,489
"'how to be rid of it. To burn it out of your
system with a fire you will never find. I've done

175
00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:02,616
"'it before. I can burn away the worst of
illnesses.'

176
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:11,847
"Now, I am a creature that can pierce any lie by
nature. I know in my heart that he spoke the truth

177
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:26,109
"that day, that dragon. When asked what he wanted
in return, he said, 'Your servitude.' We made an

178
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:32,674
"agreement. He would return once he marked his
domain. We discussed the terms.

179
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:43,193
"However, he did not return. I grew furious and
sought answers only to find that he was brought

180
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:54,614
"low and sealed away by some assembled others, some
fools from Emon. It took me years of seeking, but

181
00:16:54,614 --> 00:17:00,419
"I found his whereabouts. I was not going to let my
chance to strike away this bloody curse slip from

182
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:11,282
"me, so I met him on the fire plane. Over the
years, I saw his swelling, his pained form. He

183
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:16,763
"spoke of plans, ideas for vengeance and
domination, but he would not relinquish the

184
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:20,140
"secrets he promised me until I released him.

185
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:27,940
"I proposed the Conclave. I assembled the others.
I negotiated the agreements. I corrupted the

186
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,428
"binding stone. I prepared the Pyrah gate. I did
<i>everything</i>!

187
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:43,901
"As time went on, Thordak's clarity muddled. It
seemed his bindings, the power that he was

188
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:51,814
"absorbing, was beginning to drive him mad, so we
did not have any more time. I needed to initiate

189
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:57,677
"the escape before he lost enough to forget our
agreement, the means to even fulfill his side of

190
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:07,080
"the bargain. No celestial solstice as planned, but
Winter's Crest would have to do. And with Thordak

191
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,600
"freed, the Conclave assembled, Tal'Dorei was
razed, divided, and won.

192
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:26,165
"But Thordak still withheld his words. He laughs
at my requests. I see now that he does not mean to

193
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:35,374
"tell me, and never really did, as his mind began
to go. He enjoys his seat of power over all of

194
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:46,774
"you, over me. I want him <i>dead</i>! I want to watch
him be torn apart, I want to see his eyes go cold

195
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:54,576
"and in that very moment, I want to call his spirit
back and bind his word to tell me how I can save

196
00:18:54,576 --> 00:19:00,190
"myself. And then laugh at his misfortune as I tear
what's left of him.

197
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:15,616
"<i>That</i> is why I come to you. I have not the power
to take him myself."

198
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:27,705
MARISHA: Thordak will experience all of those
things. He will burn and he will suffer and you

199
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,943
will not be there to watch it happen.

200
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,657
LAURA: Keyleth?

201
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:46,595
MARISHA: You want to feel the burning inside of
you? Oh, you will feel it, Raishan. But it will

202
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:58,900
not be from Thordak or whatever proposed cure he
made up. The burning you feel will be from the

203
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:14,282
souls of ten thousand Fire Ashari as they sear your
flesh, and the last thing that you will see will

204
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:27,447
be <i>my</i> face as I watch you suffer, as you watched
a quarter of my civilization burn!

205
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:40,728
MATT: "Child, I commend your bravery in the face
of certain doom, but think before you give in to

206
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:47,664
"such base passions. There is much to be gained by
us working together, and so much more to be lost."

207
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:54,984
MARISHA: Oh, you commend me for bravery? Oh,
Raishan, for someone who is supposed to be so

208
00:20:54,984 --> 00:21:09,566
smart-- I am not afraid! I know what you are. You
are a parasite. You walk around calling yourself a

209
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:20,118
magnificent ancient dragon. You are nothing more
than a leech. You consumed the energy of my people

210
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:27,459
for years! And we're supposed to just trust you?

211
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:28,905
MATT: "Child, your anger is misplaced--"

212
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,277
MARISHA: (shouting) Call me child one more goddamn
time!

213
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:33,234
TRAVIS: I move behind Keyleth.

214
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:43,043
MATT: "I did not slay a single one of your people.
Thordak's release destroyed the top of that

215
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:44,086
"mountain--"

216
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:51,170
MARISHA: (shouting) Which you did! You unleashed
the mad dog, you bitch! This is your fucking

217
00:21:51,170 --> 00:22:09,969
fault! (quieter) He's just a mad king. As you said
so yourself, you're the master planner! But your

218
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:20,345
plan backfired, didn't it? So now you've come to
us, and you think that you can formulate some

219
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:29,551
other master plan that's still going to somehow
get you what you want! You dumb fool. When will

220
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,662
you fucking learn?

221
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:37,981
MATT: "Keyleth."

222
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,524
MARISHA: Raishan.

223
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:55,168
MATT: "Do not mistake my grace in this room for
need of conflict, nor foolhardy wishes. If I

224
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:59,697
"wanted each one of you dead, I would be chewing on
your bones right now."

225
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:19,607
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, if I may be so bold as
to tidy up what Keyleth is trying to drive home

226
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:31,012
here, is that for all intents and purposes from
this side of the table, you strike me as a

227
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:37,638
desperate creature who's pretending that he has a
choice to be here and has brought-- she, excuse

228
00:23:37,638 --> 00:23:46,655
me. That is another conversation. You've brought
very little to the table. We are not impressed

229
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:52,316
with your notions that somehow we can work
together. You need us, and this is all you bring?

230
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,868
MATT: "I bring information--"

231
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,322
TALIESIN: (scoffs)

232
00:23:56,322 --> 00:23:58,042
MATT: "I bring knowledge of Thordak--"

233
00:23:58,042 --> 00:23:59,360
TALIESIN: Where is Asum?

234
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,005
MATT: "I know where Asum is--"

235
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,465
TALIESIN: Where is Asum?

236
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:04,698
LIAM: Let's start with that.

237
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:07,843
TALIESIN: Let's stop pretending you have a choice
here.

238
00:24:07,843 --> 00:24:20,717
MATT: "The one you call Seeker Asum is alive, in
Emon, still working amongst the Clasp. The story I

239
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:28,992
"gave you was mostly truth, peppered with necessary
deceit to place me here amongst you for the time I

240
00:24:28,992 --> 00:24:33,818
"needed. He is there to secure survivors against
Thordak.

241
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:41,634
"I infiltrated the ranks of the Clasp, gained his
trust, which allowed me to find your whereabouts,

242
00:24:41,634 --> 00:24:49,289
"and so I came. He sent me on a mission to notify
you of his plans, which, by the way, along with

243
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:56,722
"Brotoras, Goldhand, and the Clasp's cooperation,
they have a plan to strike at the Cinder King."

244
00:24:56,722 --> 00:25:10,866
LIAM: Insight check. Well, hold on. No. 13. Never
mind.

00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:13,055
MATT: Slippery dragon.

(laughter)

247
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:18,690
MATT: There's no reason for you to believe or
disbelieve. It's just words to you right now.

248
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,311
LIAM: Yeah.

249
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:25,841
LAURA: What's their plan?

250
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:35,702
MATT: "One that'll fail, of course. You see, they
put their knowledge in what a red dragon is

251
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:42,719
"capable of. They believe that by quelling the
flames or stoking some nature of the crystal in

252
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:48,069
"its belly's magic, there would be a way to stop
him. And there is a path to be taken there, yes,

253
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:54,517
"but their knowledge is faulty. They don't
understand the nature of the enchantment, and

"should they attack, they will burn in the flames
of their own righteousness."

LAURA: What's your illness?

256
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:14,726
MATT: "I wish I knew the extent of it--" And you
watch as Asum's form grows a little more green in

257
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:20,595
places, the scales unfolding, and as the image,
though still in the halfling form, where the

258
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:25,517
scales rest you can see a series of deep,
purplish-black veins that ride up the side of the

259
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:38,267
throat, and across the chest and the arms, and
they pulse with each heartbeat. "It withers my

260
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:50,605
"constitution. It makes me weary. I've sat with
this for nearly a hundred years. My brain is not

"dull, but I wish not to have this brilliant
intellect waste away into ash because I couldn't

"find an answer."

00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:00,487
LAURA: So you come before us and you tell us
you're weak?

264
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:03,397
MATT: "Well, weak by my standards."

265
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:06,556
MARISHA: You're weak by mine, too.

LIAM: <i>If</i> we were to work with you, and that is a
massive fucking if, if we were to work with you

267
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:21,357
and Thordak were to fall-- Paint us a picture,
what can we look forward to after that? What

268
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:24,517
happens to you, where do you go, what happens to
Tal'Dorei?

00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:31,801
MATT: "I have no interest in this mass domination.
Most of these petty creatures that you call your

270
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:37,386
"brethren, they live amongst their cities, and
that's fine. My happiness lies in returning to my

271
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:43,478
"home in the Rifenmist, where I can pillage the
eastern and southern coasts. Or I can ride out

272
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:50,717
"amongst the Viridian Ocean and steal what is
necessary to survive and enjoy my network of

273
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:54,173
"followers and spies. Far away from where you
live."

274
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:59,177
LIAM: You might as well be feeding us nursery
rhymes.

275
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,796
MARISHA: Sounds like a life happily ever after.

276
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:10,657
MATT: "If you're uncomfortable with my proximity,
post the fall of the king, I will happily take my

277
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:17,274
"presence elsewhere. Gather my people, my
belongings, and find a roost, somewhere across the

278
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:18,907
"Ozmit perhaps."

279
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:22,815
TALIESIN: I'm comfortable with that being a
conversation that happens later.

280
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:25,369
LAURA: Well, obviously, but I don't believe
anything she says.

281
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:30,249
TRAVIS: You're sure that Thordak has a cure for
you?

282
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:43,038
MATT: "I have spent many years trying to untangle
what could be the lie behind those eyes, and I am

283
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:53,581
"certain. There is a confidence with knowing and
withholding. It is stronger than the strongest of

284
00:28:53,581 --> 00:29:03,652
"bluffs, and I've seen that confidence in the
Cinder King. A cruelty in that knowledge, that

285
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:05,133
"smugness."

286
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:09,619
LAURA: Is he still insane?

287
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:21,661
MATT: "By most standards, has been for some time,
but it continues to slip. His narcissism grows to

288
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:24,423
"dangerous bounds."

289
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:28,837
TRAVIS: What about the white dragon?

290
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:35,573
TALIESIN: Before we would consider any terms, we
would need the white dragon removed from the

291
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,932
playing field.

292
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:46,238
MARISHA: Could be a good way for you to show us
your loyalty, even though you have none. But know,

293
00:29:46,238 --> 00:30:03,541
Raishan, whatever deal we strike does not end in
you leaving my sight. You're going to die. You're

294
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:08,334
going to die, even if I have to die doing it.

295
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:12,511
MATT: "Amusing."

296
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:20,756
TALIESIN: Really, this is a conversation about
whether or not we wait to try and kill you until

297
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:27,154
before or after the Cinder King. That's fair, I
think.

298
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:37,221
MATT: "You think that because you took surprise
upon Umbrasyl, the brute, his inferior intellect,

299
00:30:37,221 --> 00:30:45,648
"that you will have the opportunity to strike me
down? You have no idea what I'm capable of, no

300
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:48,610
"matter what malady festers within me."

301
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,214
TALIESIN: Oh, we know.

302
00:30:53,214 --> 00:30:55,736
MATT: "This is your home, right, Percival?"

303
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:56,693
TALIESIN: It is.

304
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:59,230
MATT: "It would be a shame for it to suddenly no
longer exist."

305
00:30:59,286 --> 00:31:01,347
MARISHA: Can we please just fucking kill her now?

306
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:12,838
TALIESIN: I'm not Keyleth. Your threats, they
won't bend me, because I believe you. I believe

307
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:19,521
that you would rend this entire city asunder.
That's why I'm at the table. I am conscious of

308
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:30,706
where we are, I'm conscious of who you are, and
I'm conscious of what you need. I'm just trying to

309
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:36,597
make sure that everybody's clear that the minute
that red dragon dies, all bets are off. You know

310
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:45,404
it as well as I do. And you should be wary,
because only one side of this table is

311
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,471
underestimating the other.

312
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:52,234
TRAVIS: Which side is it?

313
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:53,692
TALIESIN: Thank you, Grog.

314
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:59,158
SAM: Can I do a perception check to make sure that
this being is actually in the room and is not just

315
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:01,480
some sort of phantom?

316
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,861
LAURA: We've seen this before.

317
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:11,526
SAM: 17. Oh wait, am I proficient? No, 19.

318
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:19,936
MATT: 19, okay. The entity you see before you does
appear to be physically present, to the best of

319
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:24,609
your knowledge. No one's touched it or attempted
to, but it does seem to be present with you.

320
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:31,563
TRAVIS: All right, I love a good story, so do you have
a plan?

321
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:33,763
TALIESIN: One step at a time. White dragon.

322
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:49,304
MATT: "Vorugal is a beast. Simple of mind. Eager
to kill, eat, sleep. That's about the extent. As

323
00:32:49,304 --> 00:32:53,541
"long as it's given enough land and cattle to
devour, it seems happy. It enjoys the hunt; it

324
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,541
"enjoys the challenge."

325
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,820
TALIESIN: How willing do you feel to be a
participant in his demise?

326
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,046
LIAM: A lot better if you'd be willing to shed a
bit of blood.

327
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,108
TALIESIN: Get your hands dirty.

328
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:11,206
MARISHA: Oh, she's already done that.

329
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:22,609
MATT: "Our agreement, should this go forward, does
not end when the Cinder King dies. I demand the

330
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:26,262
"opportunity to converse with the spirit from the
corpse.

331
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:46,626
"Once that's done, then you may pull your rug out
from under me, if you will. I wish you the best of luck."

332
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:51,980
TALIESIN: Well, I assume once he's dead, either
you'll turn on us or you'll run away. Either way

333
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,816
works for me.

334
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:56,425
LIAM: Yeah, we're getting a bit ahead of
ourselves. Are you going to scrap with the white

335
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,977
dragon with us or not?

336
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:02,913
LAURA: Can you talk him into flying off, leaving
everyone alone?

337
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:06,236
TALIESIN: No, I want a dead dragon.

338
00:34:06,236 --> 00:34:16,053
MATT: "You see, whereas I have the aptitude to
know where my alliances stand, Vorugal is, of the

339
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,368
"entire Conclave, the closest Thordak has to a lap
dog."

340
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:20,440
LAURA: So dead, then.

341
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,702
MATT: "Probably the best bet, yes."

342
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:26,375
TALIESIN: Yes, Grog?

343
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:36,623
TRAVIS: I have a question. Do you want to talk to
Thordak's dead spirit, or are you after the big

344
00:34:36,623 --> 00:34:38,181
shiny jewel in the middle of his chest?

345
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:42,168
MATT: "I have no interest in whatever enchantment
shackles him to his insanity. I merely wish to

346
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:45,903
"draw from him the secret I've been promised."

347
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:47,298
TRAVIS: Insight check to see if he's lying.

348
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:48,174
LAURA: Ditto!

349
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:49,559
MATT: Insight check, both of you guys, go.

350
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,403
LAURA: Oh, that was terrible!

351
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:52,666
TRAVIS: 18.

352
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:57,124
LAURA: Ugh, 13.

353
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:58,280
MATT: Seems to be telling the truth.

354
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,222
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

355
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,617
LAURA: Well, yeah, sure she does.

356
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:02,016
TRAVIS: He's telling the truth.

357
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,804
LAURA: She.

358
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:04,381
TRAVIS: She's telling the truth.

359
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:17,086
TALIESIN: Once the white dragon's off the board,
then we will hammer out whatever promises can be

360
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:24,430
made, but until then, there's just many players on
the field to say one way or another.

361
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,359
LAURA: Have you been here as Asum this whole time?
What have you been doing?

362
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,141
MATT: "Gathering information, like I do."

363
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:34,886
LAURA: What do you do, sleep in his room like a
halfling?

364
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:41,567
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you wear his clothes, and use his
soap, and brush with his toothbrush?

365
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:46,824
MATT: "No, I moved down to the stables and found a
soft bit of hay. <i>Yes,</i> I sleep in his bed and his clothes."

366
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:53,885
TRAVIS: That's a lot of attitude to what I feel is
a simple question. It's gross.

367
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:54,842
MARISHA: It's pretty gross.

368
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:58,498
TALIESIN: It must be so humiliating for you that
you need to turn to us for help. You do have my

369
00:35:58,498 --> 00:35:59,772
pity in that regard.

370
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:06,932
MATT: "It isn't the most optimal circumstance, but
I think we both have much to gain."

371
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:12,621
MARISHA: Why do you think Thordak is the only one with
knowledge of a cure?

372
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:17,288
MATT: "Because everywhere I've sought the
information seems to have been destroyed by

373
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:19,074
"Thordak once we made the accord."

374
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:22,331
LAURA: If you tell us what the disease is--

375
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:36,674
MARISHA: Because that puny little druid that
cursed you-- well, don't forget you're dealing

376
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,763
with a puny little druid right here.

377
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:43,831
MATT: "You could take a look if you like, but I
myself do not know its nature."

378
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:46,296
LAURA: Have you tried Greater Restoration?

379
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,992
(laughter)

380
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:50,657
MARISHA: That seems to be the solution to all of
our problems.

381
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:52,724
TALIESIN: It's the chicken soup of Dungeons and
Dragons.

382
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:56,314
MARISHA: Chicken soup for the DND soul.

383
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,737
LIAM: It's feed a curse, starve perma-death.

384
00:36:58,737 --> 00:37:06,662
TRAVIS: Please, go ahead.

385
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:10,162
MATT: "Yes, I have."

386
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,284
MARISHA: What was the question?

387
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:16,976
MATT: "I've tried all forms of cleansing magic.
I've bent many diviners to my aid, and all have

388
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:27,553
"failed! This isn't a simple magic, this was a
spirit curse, this was something far more

389
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:29,224
"powerful."

390
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:34,547
TRAVIS: Sounds like a job for me. (spits) Come
on.

391
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:36,736
TALIESIN: You don't have to.

392
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:39,059
MATT: "I don't want to."

393
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:43,231
TRAVIS: Spit smells funny, you know.

394
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:45,823
TALIESIN: Is it two days until the white dragon?

395
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:48,146
LAURA: How long do we have?

396
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:54,404
TRAVIS: Wait, will Thordak know if we do something
to Vorugal?

397
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:56,207
TALIESIN: Of course.

398
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:01,243
MATT: "It's likely. Very quickly, yes."

399
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:02,170
TRAVIS: Why?

400
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,767
MATT: "Keeps a close watch on his subjects. He's
paranoid. Requires us to continuously

401
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,911
"check in, which I have been."

402
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:13,352
LAURA: You've been checking in from where? Here?

403
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:18,444
MATT: "I have my means in my room, yes."

404
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:20,681
LAURA: Does he know where you are?

405
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:27,432
MATT: "No. As far as he knows, I'm currently
somewhere on the outskirts of Westruun attempting

406
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:31,394
"to forge some sort of vengeance for what happened
to Umbrasyl."

407
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:38,755
TALIESIN: If he did find out he was here, it would
be very easy to turn the two of them against each

408
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:39,710
other.

409
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:52,898
LAURA: So when Vorugal flew over... did he not
sense you?

410
00:38:52,898 --> 00:39:00,792
MATT: "I'm very good at avoiding the sight of
those who would seek me if I wish not to be seen."

411
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:04,925
LAURA: Was he seeking you, or was he seeking
Whitestone?

412
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:10,077
MATT: "Based on the correspondence that was put
out by Thordak, he was very perturbed at the death

413
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:19,810
"of the black dragon that you've slain. As such,
sent a rather large assortment of his and

414
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:26,910
"Vorugal's wyvern army to sweep the entire middle
eastern side of Tal'Dorei in search of you, I

415
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,284
"presume.

416
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:38,686
"Thankfully, your allies put up some sort of
illusory barrier, which I did not disturb during

417
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:42,371
"that time, to whatever consolation that is to our
agreement."

418
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:48,059
TALIESIN: It is of great consolation. In fact, I
would go so far as to say that I am willing to say

419
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:56,341
that these talks will continue post the
destruction of the white dragon, so long as these

420
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:58,602
talks take place in Whitestone.

421
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:02,304
LAURA: We won't have much time to talk after the
destruction of the white dragon.

422
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:08,883
TALIESIN: We'll have enough. And if there is no
Whitestone to hold talks in, there will be no talks.

423
00:40:08,883 --> 00:40:10,345
MATT: "This is true."

424
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:19,679
SAM: One moment. Game this out for me, friends. If
this is all bullshit and Thordak has sent this

425
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:29,078
little lady here to trick us into traveling with
her to Draconia, where Thordak is lying in wait to

426
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:36,405
kill us the second we get there, well, then if
we're making a deal for this little lady to kill

427
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:42,412
on our behalf, why do we need to go? Can we just
stay in Whitestone and you go kill the white

428
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:45,659
dragon for us? You're powerful, aren't you? Why do
you need us?

429
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:56,334
MATT: "You see, if I were to utilize my full
potential, which would be required to fell

430
00:40:56,334 --> 00:41:03,061
"Vorugal-- as idiotic as the creature is, it's
still a very dangerous and cunning foe."

431
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:06,203
LIAM: Not for you. You're so clever.

432
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:13,410
SAM: Yeah, you can pretend to be Vorugal's--
something, pet hamster-- for a while until you

433
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,265
kill him in his sleep.

434
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:23,001
MATT: "Maybe I overestimated your intelligence,
but in doing so, would immediately paint a target

435
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:29,011
"on my back for Thordak. I think it's best that I
remain in his good graces, as we all flank up

436
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:31,482
"unexpectedly when the time is right."

437
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:32,642
TALIESIN: He is correct.

438
00:41:32,642 --> 00:41:33,879
MATT: "She!"

439
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:35,823
TALIESIN: I'm really enjoying that.

440
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:41,766
TRAVIS: I would also say that if she wanted to set
a trap with three dragons on us, they would all be

441
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,146
here right now.

442
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:50,662
TALIESIN: Also, they could've avoided it entirely
and waited for us to go to Draconia, as opposed to

443
00:41:50,662 --> 00:41:55,374
having someone come by to remind us that we were
going to Draconia in the first place. It seems

444
00:41:55,374 --> 00:41:57,153
like an awful lot of work.

445
00:41:57,153 --> 00:42:01,663
MARISHA: I still don't really know why we need her
to begin with. We're powerful enough. Why don't we

446
00:42:01,663 --> 00:42:02,959
just kill her now?

447
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,697
TALIESIN: Honestly? Because it would damage the
castle.

448
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:09,755
TRAVIS: No, don't provoke--

449
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:12,733
SAM: What is that move? Don't do that.

450
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:16,397
MARISHA: Are you inviting?

451
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:25,821
MATT: "I'm saying the choice is yours. Either we
work together, or you all fall."

452
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:30,685
TRAVIS: Come on. Even my simple mind sees the
advantages here.

453
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:36,769
LIAM: Keyleth. All we're debating is the order in
which they die.

454
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:42,576
MARISHA: She was first on my list.

455
00:42:42,576 --> 00:43:02,611
TALIESIN: I don't recommend lists. The only reason
I'm stopping you from doing this-- and I swear

456
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:05,858
this is the truth-- is because this is my home.

457
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:07,954
MARISHA: But this could be our best chance.

458
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:09,677
TALIESIN: There would be nothing left.

459
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:10,914
MARISHA: Could be the easiest--

460
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:22,272
MATT: "Half-elf. Look at me. Your worldview is
clouded by optimism that does not belong in

461
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:33,459
"Exandria. There is good, there is evil, but this
world has been remade many times because life is

462
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:41,907
"destruction. You should know this as a purveyor of
life in its own right. The cycle lives on. The

"chaos perseveres. Everything grows, eats, then
dies or is eaten. You can put whatever fine

464
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:54,118
"dressing on it you like."

465
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:56,050
LIAM: Yeah, shut the fuck up, sick bag.

466
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:01,576
MARISHA: She's not making this easy to walk away,
you guys!

467
00:44:01,576 --> 00:44:10,229
LIAM: Percy is right. We don't want the
people of Whitestone to fall like the people of

468
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:13,629
the Ashari.

469
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:15,570
LAURA: More deaths do not make it right, Keyleth.

470
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,957
TRAVIS: You're going to get yours. You're going to
get it.

471
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:23,711
MATT: "Are you telling me you have not claimed a
life or two in your time? Do you think your goals

472
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:29,497
"and your attempts to save those close to you have
not been wrought with bloodshed?"

473
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:40,389
MARISHA: Oh, I know the consequences of every step
of my actions. It is you, Raishan, who did not

474
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,198
realize the biggest consequence is standing in
front of you right now.

475
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:48,645
MATT: "Do you think you have not stepped on an
anthill to get to your destination?"

476
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,954
MARISHA: I don't give a flying shit.

477
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:54,667
MATT: "I merely stepped on an anthill to get to
mine."

478
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:56,797
LIAM: You're just fucking winding her up, man.

479
00:44:56,797 --> 00:45:07,472
MATT: "Understand, there are different levels of
thought, intellect, and intent here. I come to you

480
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:14,240
"because we have much to gain together. Or lose
everything by not listening to what I have to say."

481
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,973
TALIESIN: You will join us in the fight against
the white dragon.

482
00:45:16,973 --> 00:45:24,178
MATT: "I will, if you promise to let Thordak's
soul be mine."

483
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:27,143
TALIESIN: Nope, that's not the deal.

484
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:30,217
LIAM: We're talking about a second round of
negotiations.

485
00:45:30,217 --> 00:45:35,670
TALIESIN: We will consider your offer once the
white dragon is dead, not a minute before.

486
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,746
MATT: "This isn't a negotiation."

487
00:45:37,746 --> 00:45:40,668
TALIESIN: This is everything of a negotiation, you
fool.

488
00:45:40,668 --> 00:45:42,522
MATT: "What am I getting out of this?"

489
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,132
TALIESIN: Your life!

490
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:46,852
SAM: An opportunity to prove yourself to us.

491
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:47,975
TALIESIN: A cure to yourself.

492
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:51,418
LAURA: A chance to take down Thordak. You said
yourself you can't do it on your own.

493
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:54,554
LIAM: We haven't danced with a dragon that now
stands breathing.

494
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:57,072
TALIESIN: Your desperation is so obvious.

495
00:45:57,072 --> 00:46:03,579
MARISHA: We walk away, and you die. Or we stay,
(whispering) and you die.

496
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:20,686
MATT: "If I aid you with the tearing of Vorugal as
a show of goodwill, in response, you keep my true

497
00:46:20,686 --> 00:46:23,659
"nature secret between those in this room."

498
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:27,772
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah.

499
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:33,281
MATT: "You maintain that I have access to the
length and breadth of Whitestone."

500
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:41,295
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. Why the length and bread of
Whitestone?

501
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:49,959
MATT: "Largely because I have interests in
deciding my plan against Thordak. Let's just say

502
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:55,734
"some of it may include a trinket or two that have
come in your way on your travels."

503
00:46:55,734 --> 00:47:04,695
TRAVIS: Are you fully aware of what lies beneath
Whitestone?

504
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:08,019
MATT: "I have some ideas."

505
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,794
TALIESIN: Would you like to see it?

506
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:12,868
MATT: "I have seen it already."

507
00:47:12,868 --> 00:47:14,170
TALIESIN: Have you?

508
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,370
LAURA: You've been down there?

509
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,294
MATT: "I've been here for some time, my dear."

510
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,845
LAURA: Then why didn't we meet down there? Why are
you so scared of it?

511
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:24,162
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you've seen it, tell us what it
is.

512
00:47:24,162 --> 00:47:28,688
MARISHA: I know. You know.

513
00:47:28,688 --> 00:47:30,209
TALIESIN: Of course he--

514
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:34,605
SAM: You say it first.

515
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:38,960
MATT: "I'm not telling you anything. That was not
part of the negotiation."

516
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,423
TRAVIS: How big is it? If you've seen it.

517
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:44,887
(laughter)

518
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:46,559
SAM: Describe it.

519
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,498
TALIESIN: One dead white dragon and then--

520
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:53,039
MARISHA: Oh jeez, what is that?

521
00:47:53,039 --> 00:48:01,576
MATT: Raishan snaps her fingers. You see a spark,
and you notice a brief burst akin to a minor

522
00:48:01,576 --> 00:48:06,359
illusion. No sound, nothing, just the image of a
tiny black orb.

523
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,046
TRAVIS: Shit! She's seen it.

524
00:48:09,046 --> 00:48:22,297
TALIESIN: One dead white dragon, and then the
negotiations continue. We will speak to no one of

525
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:28,637
what you truly are, although we may caution others
that we're looking a bit sideways at Seeker Asum.

526
00:48:28,637 --> 00:48:35,009
MATT: "I would recommend none of that. Any
suspicion means I'm being followed. If I'm

527
00:48:35,009 --> 00:48:41,720
"followed and feeling threatened, the person you
told may not survive. We do not want that, but I'm

528
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,957
"going to look out for myself, so anyone you tell,
you're putting in danger."

529
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,585
TALIESIN: That's also fair.

530
00:48:48,585 --> 00:48:54,914
MARISHA: Anyone you touch, you're then putting
yourself in danger. If any of our friends wind up

531
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:57,822
dead, we're looking at you first.

532
00:48:57,822 --> 00:48:59,802
MATT: "Fair enough."

533
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:01,899
LAURA: Have you done anything with the rest of our
friends?

534
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:07,340
MARISHA: Where's Asum? Did we already cover that?

535
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,851
LAURA: Yeah, we already covered that.

536
00:49:08,851 --> 00:49:11,145
MARISHA: I was very angry. I couldn't hear a whole
lot.

537
00:49:11,145 --> 00:49:16,209
TALIESIN: Whitestone will not fall. If Whitestone
falls, all deals are off. If Whitestone is

538
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:19,285
attacked, all deals are off. You keep it off the
radar.

539
00:49:19,285 --> 00:49:24,403
MATT: "It's already off the radar. I just will not
touch the radar."

540
00:49:24,403 --> 00:49:25,814
TALIESIN: That'll do.

541
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:26,917
LIAM: What is radar?

542
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:28,221
MATT: "I don't know."

543
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:31,563
TALIESIN: Do you never go into my room? Do you
never look at what I'm working on?

544
00:49:31,563 --> 00:49:33,438
SAM: What room are we in right now?

545
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:36,062
MATT: This is the old war room, which is upstairs
facing the front.

546
00:49:36,062 --> 00:49:40,553
LAURA: The old war room, because we moved the new
one down into the ziggurat and she didn't respect that!

547
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:41,394
MATT: Nope.

548
00:49:41,394 --> 00:49:43,938
MARISHA: (whispers) Bitch.

549
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:46,691
LIAM: I said (singing) bitch.

550
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:51,447
SAM: How big is the room?

551
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:58,701
MATT: It's about, I'd say-- close to 30 feet by 60
feet.

552
00:49:58,701 --> 00:50:01,215
SAM: How many entrances?

553
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:04,321
MATT: There's two doors that enter, and then two
windows that face out the front.

554
00:50:04,321 --> 00:50:06,662
LAURA: Are you going to attack her all of a
sudden? Are you going to attack her right now?

555
00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:08,848
SAM: We should probably kill her right now.

556
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:15,567
MARISHA: I agree with that! Can I do a scan of the
room, like a perception check to see if I notice

557
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:20,080
magical traps or anything weird set up?

558
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,539
MATT: Make an investigation check.

559
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:22,759
MARISHA: Investigation?

560
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:24,499
MATT: If you're looking for traps, it's
investigation.

561
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:27,293
MARISHA: No, is there anything off? Does it look
like there's an opening?

562
00:50:27,293 --> 00:50:29,011
MATT: Make a general perception check.

563
00:50:29,011 --> 00:50:32,174
TRAVIS: We can kill her whenever. Might as well
use her.

564
00:50:32,174 --> 00:50:38,198
MARISHA: General perception? 21.

565
00:50:38,198 --> 00:50:43,819
MATT: 21? Glancing about the room, it does not
appear to have anything that you notice different.

566
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:47,375
It has the two banners on the side walls. It has
the table in the center with some chairs scattered

567
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:55,942
about and there's the two windows opposite. One
window that currently Raishan has to her back.

568
00:50:55,942 --> 00:51:04,647
LIAM: I don't think Scanlan is wrong. I think he
is weak.

569
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:08,320
LAURA: Why?

570
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,494
SAM: It.

571
00:51:09,494 --> 00:51:18,503
LIAM: However, she will try to destroy as much as
possible out of spite in her death throes.

572
00:51:18,503 --> 00:51:24,940
TALIESIN: Thus also exposing the city. We will be
attacked. That will be the end of Whitestone.

573
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:33,562
TRAVIS: I walk up very gingerly to Keyleth, and I
grab one of her antlers very gently, and I say:

574
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:43,077
Look, if you want to go, we're with you, but if
you exercise a little patience, I think we'll get

575
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:45,889
more out of this, and you'll still get yours in
the end.

576
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:50,671
MARISHA: Is Grog talking to me about patience
right now?

577
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:52,598
LAURA: That's very important.

578
00:51:52,598 --> 00:51:53,782
MARISHA: That's so extreme.

579
00:51:53,782 --> 00:52:01,591
TRAVIS: Don't get me wrong, I want to crack it
open right now, but we'll get more later.

580
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:03,122
LIAM: He's learned a lot.

581
00:52:03,122 --> 00:52:06,109
MARISHA: Grog--

582
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:19,828
TALIESIN: I guarantee you, the complete lack of
satisfaction that you feel when she's finally dead

583
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:22,858
will be just as potent two days from now.

584
00:52:22,858 --> 00:52:31,971
MARISHA: Did Thordak tell you about the trinkets
of ours that you wanted?

585
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:38,639
MATT: "Thordak has no idea what lies beneath this
city. Thordak is too obsessed with himself."

586
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:40,344
MARISHA: About what we have, I mean.

587
00:52:40,344 --> 00:52:45,901
MATT: "Are you referring to your Vestiges?"

588
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:47,175
MARISHA: She knows.

589
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:52,367
MATT: "You already told me everything. You
informed me of your entire journey."

590
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:55,646
LAURA: I know, okay! Because we're really smart
and we totally--

591
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:59,699
SAM: We knew it was you all along. We want you to
know what you're up against.

592
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:00,920
LAURA: That's right.

593
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,957
MATT: "Of course you did."

594
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:03,085
LIAM: Taunting you all along.

595
00:53:03,085 --> 00:53:08,047
MARISHA: We thought she was Asum. We talked, and
she knows. She knows. We told her everything. What

596
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:09,331
does he want?

597
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:19,731
MATT: "What does Thordak want? Thordak wants
everything. Everything. Thordak is using the

598
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:29,590
"crystal in his belly to slowly build a volcano
beneath Emon. To turn the surrounding city and the

599
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,442
"countryside into a new mountain of his visage."

600
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,837
LAURA: How long until that happens?

601
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:40,890
MATT: "That's going to be another hundred years
before the entire mountain is complete, but the

602
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:47,812
"physicality is already adjusting. The molten rock
begins to swirl and flow beneath the Cloudtop

603
00:53:47,812 --> 00:53:49,020
"District."

604
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,770
TRAVIS: Wait, you said he's building a volcano?

605
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:58,467
MATT: "Well, the volcano is being summoned beneath
him. Such is the nature of the crystal he carries.

606
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:03,993
"The energy he absorbed from the fire elemental
plane carried over with him, and it's still

607
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:10,515
"hungry. It's why he swells; that's why he's in
pain. But he just laughs amidst it, as it also

608
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:13,495
"gives him extreme power and nigh
invulnerability."

609
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:19,644
TRAVIS: And you said you knew Thordak before he
was trapped in the elemental plane. Was he, in any

610
00:54:19,644 --> 00:54:24,494
way, on what is now known as Glintshore before the
elemental plane?

611
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:30,073
MATT: "It's possible. I have no knowledge of this
Glintshore."

612
00:54:30,073 --> 00:54:34,720
LIAM: What do you know about the Briarwoods?

613
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,216
MATT: "I don't think I know anything about some
Briarwoods."

614
00:54:39,216 --> 00:54:45,463
LIAM: Really? What do you think about the wall
surrounding that beach ball down there? It's a

615
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:47,045
little creepy down there, isn't it?

616
00:54:47,045 --> 00:54:51,232
MATT: "It's a little off-putting, yes."

617
00:54:51,232 --> 00:54:56,532
LIAM: You expect us to believe you know nothing,
as smart as you are, you know <i>nothing</i> of what

618
00:54:56,532 --> 00:54:58,661
happened there in the months past.

619
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:00,324
MATT: "I know what I've been told."

620
00:55:00,324 --> 00:55:06,361
LIAM: Are you sure you're not trying to summon
something awful out of that marble?

621
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:12,161
MATT: "Do you think I wish to have another
creature that I pay subservience to?"

622
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:13,866
LAURA: No.

623
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:15,749
TRAVIS: Maybe if he can heal you.

624
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:21,266
LAURA: Is Melora an enemy of Vecna? Do we know
that?

625
00:55:21,266 --> 00:55:31,654
MATT: Essentially, Melora is the goddess of the
wilderness and the sea. Very nature, life,

626
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:40,896
elemental-based deity. Vecna is not a god. Vecna
was very powerful, wanted to become a god and was

627
00:55:40,896 --> 00:55:50,274
balked and scattered, supposedly destroyed a long
time ago but the cults still endure and infiltrate

628
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:52,550
and wander various parts of Exandria.

629
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,570
LIAM: What do you want to do with that thing?

630
00:55:54,570 --> 00:56:02,159
MATT: "It pertains to what I think is a sound plan
to bring Thordak down to our level."

631
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,061
LIAM: Well, tell me a little bit more.

632
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,511
MATT: "I will tell you, once we finish this next
length of your journey, since you are so eager to

633
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:09,266
"have made the agreement."

634
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,510
LAURA: Makes sense.

635
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,907
LIAM: I think you're lying through your teeth. I
think you want something you're not telling us

636
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:17,888
about, but I do want the white dragon dead, and we
can work on it later.

637
00:56:17,888 --> 00:56:21,628
SAM: Let's all agree that this is definitely
bullshit.

638
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:29,102
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to disagree. I think that
everything that she said is the truth, and I think

639
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:34,725
that she's not saying an awful lot more. Deception
is far less interesting if you're not telling the

640
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:40,419
truth all the time, and I think she's telling a
lot of truth, just not nearly all of it.

641
00:56:40,419 --> 00:56:42,814
LIAM: Lies of omission are a tricky thing, aren't
they?

642
00:56:42,814 --> 00:56:47,115
TALIESIN: They're far more tricky than simple
lies, and I think that we've heard an awful lot of truth.

643
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,256
TRAVIS: I'm confused.

644
00:56:49,256 --> 00:56:53,104
TALIESIN: So yes, I'm willing to work with what we
have.

645
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:57,592
MARISHA: Do you have any ideas on how to defeat
Vorugal?

646
00:56:57,592 --> 00:57:05,957
MATT: "Well, for one thing, I will be peripheral
to the battle. I will aid you, but I cannot be

647
00:57:05,957 --> 00:57:14,062
"seen on the battlefield, or Thordak will know
immediately there has been a turn of allegiance."

648
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:15,933
LAURA: So what good are you? What can you do?

649
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,301
SAM: Can you shapeshift into other beasts?

650
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:24,398
MATT: "I can change my form into a number of
creatures and be of assistance in that way. I have

651
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:28,015
"a series of arcane talents that I can bring to the
battlefield, as well."

652
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:32,830
SAM: We needed a beast to bait Vorugal with.

653
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,416
LAURA: I have an idea with that.

654
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:39,072
TALIESIN: I believe we're all on the same page.

655
00:57:39,072 --> 00:57:41,947
MARISHA: What's interesting is the way that
stacks, too.

656
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:44,072
TRAVIS: Go ahead, or do you want to save it?

657
00:57:44,072 --> 00:57:48,686
LAURA: If we're in this together, can I say it in
front of her?

658
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:49,645
SAM: Sure.

659
00:57:49,645 --> 00:57:51,700
TRAVIS: No, don't.

660
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:57,029
SAM: Well, she'll need to know, at some point.
Once we get there.

661
00:57:57,029 --> 00:58:03,048
TRAVIS: I say we agree on principle. We agree--

662
00:58:03,048 --> 00:58:07,463
TALIESIN: Yes, we agree.

663
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:11,939
TRAVIS: I agree. Hands?

664
00:58:11,939 --> 00:58:14,215
SAM: What are we agreeing on?

665
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:17,003
TRAVIS: To fight with Raishan.

666
00:58:17,003 --> 00:58:20,252
TALIESIN: I'm in this far.

667
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:27,064
SAM: You don't need our votes. It's already
decided.

668
00:58:27,064 --> 00:58:32,765
TRAVIS: You're abstaining? I really wish you would
vote. Your vote matters.

669
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:36,304
SAM: Is voting this time important, particularly?

670
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,528
LIAM: Jump on the carpet and go kill her, anyway.

671
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:43,614
SAM: But if I don't vote, won't someone else vote
for me?

672
00:58:43,614 --> 00:58:48,053
TRAVIS: No, you actually sway the vote in greater
ways than you can possibly imagine. Very

673
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:49,093
important.

674
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,844
SAM: I don't even know how. Is it easy to find
out?

675
00:58:50,844 --> 00:58:52,434
TRAVIS: I'm sure the internet has all your
answers.

676
00:58:52,434 --> 00:58:55,678
SAM: I should go online and find out how to
register to vote.

677
00:58:55,678 --> 00:59:00,646
LIAM: Look, it's never an easy choice, but you
have to fall down on one side or the other,

678
00:59:00,646 --> 00:59:01,735
Scanlan.

679
00:59:01,735 --> 00:59:04,391
LAURA: Preferably one that doesn't rely on hate as
a message.

680
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:08,301
TALIESIN: Okay, we've gone far enough off the
track. Okay, reeling it back.

681
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:11,327
SAM: All right, let's kill a dragon and feel that
burn.

682
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:16,290
(laughter)

683
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:20,227
LIAM: Oh, Chris Hardwick as Gern, coming in for
the political joke!

684
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:25,101
SAM: All right, I'm in, for now.

685
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:26,773
MATT: "All right."

686
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:34,214
MARISHA: Keyleth holds her hand out to shake her
hand.

687
00:59:34,214 --> 00:59:40,066
LIAM: I am drawing a blade behind my back.

688
00:59:40,066 --> 00:59:45,948
MATT: Asum walks around the table slowly, making
eye contact with you, those yellow, reptilian

689
00:59:45,948 --> 00:59:58,615
slits for eyes. Brushes past you. "You've grown
quite a bit in just these few moments, young Keyleth."

690
00:59:58,615 --> 01:00:09,537
MARISHA: I heat up my hands a little bit with my
flame hands. Feel the burn.

691
01:00:09,537 --> 01:00:16,425
SAM: The dragon dies.

692
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:19,496
(laughter)

693
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:29,395
MATT: She stands there, keeping the grip, and then
releases your hand. "Very well. What's your plan

694
01:00:29,395 --> 01:00:32,398
"against Vorugal?"

695
01:00:32,398 --> 01:00:42,152
TRAVIS: We need a moment. I feel like the emotions
in here are a bit raw. Can we please?

696
01:00:42,152 --> 01:00:47,955
TALIESIN: We will reconvene tomorrow for battle.
Plan for travel. Tomorrow morning to arrange

697
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:50,372
travel and the battle plan towards--

698
01:00:50,372 --> 01:00:53,251
SAM: Shouldn't we keep an eye on this one all
night?

699
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:54,209
TALIESIN: No.

700
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:56,315
LAURA: What? We haven't kept an eye on her the
whole time.

701
01:00:56,315 --> 01:01:00,276
SAM: I know, but she could be sneaking around,
creeping into rooms--

702
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:02,317
TALIESIN: That she hasn't already creeped into?

703
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:07,384
MATT: "I can guarantee you you're not wrong, but I
have been and I will, regardless of what you try."

704
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:11,253
SAM: She could come into my room at night and do
things to me that I don't want to be done.

705
01:01:11,253 --> 01:01:13,331
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, there's nothing--

706
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:15,566
TALIESIN: Let's be fair.

707
01:01:15,566 --> 01:01:18,404
LAURA: You're giving her ideas right now, aren't
you?

708
01:01:18,404 --> 01:01:24,222
TALIESIN: I'm not changing the status of the
castle. She has the same status she had before,

709
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,203
there's no sense in changing them.

710
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:29,334
SAM: I'm going to have sex with every beast on
every continent.

711
01:01:29,334 --> 01:01:31,344
TALIESIN: Thank you, Captain Kirk.

712
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:34,173
MATT: (singing) Gotta catch 'em all.

713
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:37,403
(laughter)

714
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:40,200
TALIESIN: I'm content with this.

715
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:48,497
MATT: "Very well. I'll go check in with the boss,
if you will. Alleviate any concern on his end."

716
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:49,805
TALIESIN: Thank you.

717
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:51,224
MATT: "We shall meet tomorrow."

718
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:52,688
TALIESIN: See you tomorrow.

719
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:57,674
MARISHA: Can I get an insight check on that "check
in with the boss?" See if she's going to turn

720
01:01:57,674 --> 01:01:59,731
around and tell him everything.

721
01:01:59,731 --> 01:02:01,068
LAURA: Natural 20!

722
01:02:01,068 --> 01:02:06,359
MARISHA: Come on, natural 20! It wasn't bad. It
was a 15, so 26.

723
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:07,744
TRAVIS: That's not a 20.

724
01:02:07,744 --> 01:02:09,501
SAM: Whispers.

725
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:14,223
TALIESIN: While you're whispering, Sam's got
another rap for you.

726
01:02:14,223 --> 01:02:17,245
SAM: Do I?

727
01:02:17,245 --> 01:02:25,942
LIAM: (rapping) Whenever I go to the Loot Crate,
somebody kill me now 'cause of the embarrassment

728
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,482
I'm experiencing, live in front of the Internet.

729
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:29,914
TALIESIN: Hey-o.

730
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:36,480
TRAVIS: Holy shit. I was alive for that. I was
alive for that just now.

731
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,222
LIAM: I didn't have a sideways hat. I needed a
sideways hat.

732
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,174
TRAVIS: The glasses didn't help, either.

733
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,831
LIAM: What is this? Manure Movers of America?

734
01:02:44,831 --> 01:02:46,639
SAM: That's my hat.

735
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,268
TALIESIN: The feather shirt really adds the
whole--

736
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:53,533
(laughter)

737
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:55,472
SAM: Yeah, boi!

738
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:56,892
MATT: Raishan looks very confused.

739
01:02:56,892 --> 01:03:00,173
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

740
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:06,672
MATT: "Very well. See you tomorrow." The image of
the veins, the scales, everything, reverts back to

741
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:09,765
normal. Seeker Asum nods and leaves the room.

742
01:03:09,765 --> 01:03:13,646
TALIESIN: Downstairs, to the real room. To the
real room, downstairs. Downstairs, to the real room.

743
01:03:13,646 --> 01:03:18,200
SAM: To the real war room, magically incapable
of--

744
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,353
LAURA: Yes.

745
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:24,379
SAM: Okay, but wait, before we go down there, two
things: Keyleth, can you scry today?

746
01:03:24,379 --> 01:03:27,182
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

747
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:28,935
TALIESIN: Do not!

748
01:03:28,935 --> 01:03:34,388
SAM: We could check in on Vorugal. Make sure that
Vorugal is actually there.

749
01:03:34,388 --> 01:03:37,576
LAURA: Don't actually look at Vorugal, look at
something near Vorugal.

750
01:03:37,576 --> 01:03:45,563
SAM: Just to make sure Vorugal is in town and not
here. We could look into Raishan's room right now

751
01:03:45,563 --> 01:03:50,190
and watch how it communicates with its boss.

752
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:53,992
TALIESIN: Absolutely do not think that's a good
idea.

753
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:56,272
LAURA: I don't think so, either. She'll know.

754
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:58,216
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go down to the war room.

755
01:03:58,216 --> 01:04:02,345
SAM: She'll go ape-shit and what? So we kill her.
We're better than she is!

756
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:04,096
TALIESIN: We're really not.

757
01:04:04,096 --> 01:04:08,517
LIAM: She's obviously hiding shit from us, and if
one of us goes and pokes our nose in there, she's

758
01:04:08,517 --> 01:04:11,155
going to start a draw, right there.

759
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:13,813
MARISHA: Are we in the war room? Can we go down
and talk about this in the war room?

760
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:18,912
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way through
Whitestone through the tunnels to the location of

761
01:04:18,912 --> 01:04:22,882
the ziggurat. The war room is a series of tables
and chairs that have been assembled on the top of

762
01:04:22,882 --> 01:04:32,234
the ziggurat, near the spinning bead of death, as
you call it. But yeah, it's makeshift, it's

763
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:37,238
functional. There's currently nobody else in here
even though there are a couple of guards stationed

764
01:04:37,238 --> 01:04:43,732
to make sure that nobody comes in here without
approval. You are currently stepping up to the top

765
01:04:43,732 --> 01:04:47,518
of the ziggurat, and there it rests, still
spinning silently in place.

766
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:49,995
TRAVIS: Drop it on them.

767
01:04:49,995 --> 01:04:54,089
LAURA: I sit on the table. What's going on?

768
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:55,894
TRAVIS: No, tell them your plan.

769
01:04:55,894 --> 01:05:00,015
MARISHA: Keyleth screams her head off for a
second.

770
01:05:00,015 --> 01:05:03,442
LAURA: You did well, dear.

771
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:15,732
TALIESIN: I know how hard that was. I know. And I
wish I could say I did as well as you did, when it

772
01:05:15,732 --> 01:05:17,408
was my turn.

773
01:05:17,408 --> 01:05:22,426
MARISHA: I don't think I understood until that
moment what you did.

774
01:05:22,426 --> 01:05:26,910
LIAM: You'll have your day. Absolutely.

775
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:38,139
TALIESIN: We can't spy on her. Well, we <i>can</i> spy
on her, but we have to be careful. We shouldn't

776
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:44,481
spy on her when she's speaking to Thordak because
Thordak might see it, which would mean that plan

777
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:46,783
or no plan, everything would be ruined.

778
01:05:46,783 --> 01:05:53,693
LIAM: If Thordak senses, sees, any one of us in
the same place as her, he will go mad.

779
01:05:53,693 --> 01:06:04,407
TALIESIN: And then if I were her, I would destroy
this city and all of us as quickly as possible and run.

780
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:10,519
LAURA: I feel like she needs to talk to the spirit
because she's going to try to absorb his power or

781
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:11,652
something.

782
01:06:11,652 --> 01:06:21,413
MARISHA: She's a fucking idiot. What do I know
about Melora and this curse? Because there are a

783
01:06:21,413 --> 01:06:23,606
lot of druids who worship Melora.

784
01:06:23,606 --> 01:06:25,471
MATT: Make a religion check.

785
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:36,413
MARISHA: That's not good. I never do religion
checks. Nine.

786
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:51,110
MATT: You know that Melora is worshipped by druids
of nature, hunters, societies that exist in a more

787
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:58,904
natural setting, as well as ship captains, oversea
merchants, in hopes of getting good luck in

788
01:06:58,904 --> 01:07:08,067
getting across large bodies of water and weather.
She is considered by some to be good, some

789
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:13,771
consider her to be in a neutral space and more of
like a mother nature type entity amongst the

790
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:23,028
pantheon here, if there was one. And as far as
curses go, you don't have too much experience with

791
01:07:23,028 --> 01:07:30,915
curses outside of the minor ones that you've seen
used or have yourself at your disposal. But even

792
01:07:30,915 --> 01:07:34,005
just from the few of you, Sam especially, Sam, go
ahead and roll an intelligence check.

793
01:07:34,005 --> 01:07:34,949
SAM: Who, me?

794
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:36,242
MATT: Yes.

795
01:07:36,242 --> 01:07:43,748
SAM: I need my thing. Hold on. Intelligence?
Straight intelligence?

796
01:07:43,748 --> 01:07:44,839
MATT: Yes.

797
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:46,647
SAM: 16.

798
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:49,055
MATT: 16, and you get to add your plus two.

799
01:07:49,055 --> 01:07:50,255
SAM: 18.

800
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:54,523
MATT: And if you wanted to, add your inspiration
die.

801
01:07:54,523 --> 01:07:59,266
SAM: I will inspire myself, which is d12 now,
right?

802
01:07:59,266 --> 01:08:00,526
MATT: Yeah, d12.

803
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:03,001
SAM: 26.

804
01:08:03,001 --> 01:08:04,202
MATT: 26, okay.

805
01:08:04,202 --> 01:08:05,907
SAM: Wow. That escalated fast.

806
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:13,312
MATT: That's what you can do as a bard; it's
pretty rad. Through the two of you conversing over

807
01:08:13,312 --> 01:08:20,143
this, there are simple curses that can be imparted
for a temporary period of time, usually as some

808
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:27,794
sort of a penance to someone who slighted you.
Some that are part of a corruption on the land, a

809
01:08:27,794 --> 01:08:36,179
blight that spreads to a life source. And there
are soul curses. Usually where someone feels so

810
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:42,097
wronged in their final moments that they basically
burn their soul and any possibility of the

811
01:08:42,097 --> 01:08:51,279
afterlife purely to scourge whoever was
responsible for their pain. It's rarely ever done,

812
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:57,919
because it is essentially accepting oblivion. Your
existence is done. The gods don't hold any sway

813
01:08:57,919 --> 01:09:03,403
over your immortal soul; there is no afterlife.
However, you die knowing, for whatever that means

814
01:09:03,403 --> 01:09:10,337
in that brief moment, that you have scarred the
individual in some degree for possibly the rest of time.

815
01:09:10,337 --> 01:09:15,300
SAM: Do we know anything about how it can be
reversed or undone?

816
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:20,964
MATT: No, you have no idea. You've heard of it in
stories. And as far as you know, it was mainly a

817
01:09:20,964 --> 01:09:25,560
folklore element, and you're like okay, no, I've
kind of heard of this. So if there was anything, this

818
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,508
might be it.

819
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:35,085
LIAM: I worry about her intentions with this
thing. Help me remember. When Pike has spoken to

820
01:09:35,085 --> 01:09:39,501
dead things, they cannot lie.

821
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:41,093
TALIESIN: That's true.

822
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:49,429
LIAM: So she wants to talk to Thordak's spirit.
Who presumably cannot lie, right?

823
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:50,765
TALIESIN: Yes.

824
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:56,600
LIAM: Which could mean the cure to this disease.
But it could mean something to do with that thing.

825
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:06,952
TALIESIN: It could. It also, and this is a third
option. (sighs) Thordak could have tasked her with

826
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:15,638
bringing us to him in a way that he feels
comfortable with, and only then will he cure her.

827
01:10:15,638 --> 01:10:18,659
I believe he holds the cure as sway.

828
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:20,999
MARISHA: This whole thing could be an entire
trap.

829
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:25,301
TALIESIN: Which means that we do have an ally for
defeating the white dragon.

830
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:27,262
SAM and TALIESIN: And should use it.

831
01:10:27,262 --> 01:10:28,765
SAM: But then right after.

832
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:31,769
TALIESIN: Well, if the opportunity presents
itself.

833
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,285
SAM: Or shake her.

834
01:10:33,285 --> 01:10:38,090
TALIESIN: If the opportunity presents itself to
kill her there, in a way that is fitting and where

835
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:40,204
we have advantage, then yes.

836
01:10:40,204 --> 01:10:41,777
LIAM: Away from this city.

837
01:10:41,777 --> 01:10:43,399
TALIESIN: In Draconia.

838
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:51,827
LAURA: We never mentioned J'mon Sa Ord when we got
back, so Asum does not know about that, or Raishan

839
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:53,500
doesn't know about that.

840
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,150
MARISHA: Unless she was scrying on us, which is
highly possible.

841
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,416
TALIESIN: Which is highly possible.

842
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:59,632
LAURA: Do we have no way of having knowledge of
when someone scries on us? They can do it.

843
01:10:59,632 --> 01:11:02,009
TALIESIN: Sometimes we can notice, but often--

844
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:06,118
MARISHA: I would have to have a super high
perception in order to maybe sense it?

845
01:11:06,118 --> 01:11:11,256
MATT: If someone were to scry on you and you were
to succeed on your saving throw, they would fail

846
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:15,504
to scry, and you'd have some sort of inkling that
something weird is going on. If you are a person

847
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:21,157
who's capable of casting the spell like you are,
you would be like, "Okay, someone's trying to peer

848
01:11:21,157 --> 01:11:22,393
"through the veil."

849
01:11:22,393 --> 01:11:26,099
LAURA: So you would know. She would know if
someone was trying to scry on us.

850
01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:27,238
MATT: Unless she--

851
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:30,231
SAM and MATT: If she picked up on it.

852
01:11:30,231 --> 01:11:33,030
MATT: You have no recollection of that happening.

853
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,678
MARISHA: Is there a way I can start looking out
for that?

854
01:11:36,678 --> 01:11:43,773
MATT: You can be very conscious of that
possibility and keen on intercepting should

855
01:11:43,773 --> 01:11:45,174
anything like that occur, sure.

856
01:11:45,174 --> 01:11:48,820
TALIESIN: The other thing that can happen is we
can set different forms of attack when we finally

857
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:54,249
go against Thordak so that we have our mode of
entry and the way that we are going to be moving

858
01:11:54,249 --> 01:12:00,328
that attack forward and make sure we have
secondary lines of attack that she will have no

859
01:12:00,328 --> 01:12:02,729
knowledge of, that we will keep separated from
her.

860
01:12:02,729 --> 01:12:08,520
SAM: Is there any way to move Whitestone, to
reinforce Whitestone, to get something here to

861
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,869
protect Whitestone?

862
01:12:09,869 --> 01:12:14,407
TALIESIN: A bit. But not a lot. There's just not
enough time.

863
01:12:14,407 --> 01:12:17,157
TRAVIS: How many Vestiges are left?

864
01:12:17,157 --> 01:12:20,780
LIAM and LAURA: Two?

865
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,472
TALIESIN: That we know of.

866
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:26,890
LAURA: Speaking of Vestige, this is part of the
plan. So?

867
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:32,232
MARISHA: The Spire of Conflux was born from
Melora, so I'm wondering--

868
01:12:32,232 --> 01:12:37,058
LAURA: (gasps) The Spire of Conflux. That's why
we've heard of her!

869
01:12:37,058 --> 01:12:38,117
MARISHA: Yeah.

870
01:12:38,117 --> 01:12:39,196
LAURA: Shit!

871
01:12:39,196 --> 01:12:43,947
MARISHA: Oh, I've been thinking about that staff
for a while. I'm wondering if I can get to the

872
01:12:43,947 --> 01:12:49,878
staff quick enough, it could be the key to really
defeating Raishan.

873
01:12:49,878 --> 01:12:53,329
LAURA: It's resting in the belly of a terrible
beast in the Abyss, right?

874
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:54,407
MARISHA: Correct.

875
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:56,109
LAURA: So. Gate scroll.

876
01:12:56,109 --> 01:12:59,562
MARISHA: And Vorugal loves something to hunt.

877
01:12:59,562 --> 01:13:06,439
LAURA: What if we bring it through, let it fight
Vorugal, kill Vorugal, get the staff--

878
01:13:06,439 --> 01:13:11,882
MARISHA: Kill Raishan. I like this plan.

879
01:13:11,882 --> 01:13:14,232
LAURA: Not like anything could go wrong with it
but--

880
01:13:14,232 --> 01:13:19,130
TALIESIN: It's a good start. It's brazen. I like
it.

881
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:23,270
SAM: (sighs)

882
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,417
TRAVIS: Yes?

883
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:25,994
TALIESIN: There's no easy way to do this.

884
01:13:25,994 --> 01:13:29,483
SAM: We don't know what that thing is that has--
what the beast is.

885
01:13:29,483 --> 01:13:33,799
MARISHA: Apparently, it's a goristro. A goristro?

886
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:35,411
TALIESIN: Can I make a history check?

887
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,051
MARISHA: It's a barista?

888
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:40,265
TALIESIN: There's no defeating a barista.

889
01:13:40,265 --> 01:13:44,179
MARISHA: And she's really angry, because it's fall
time. Pumpkin spice lattes.

890
01:13:44,179 --> 01:13:46,805
MATT: No, I'd say this would be a religion check.

891
01:13:46,805 --> 01:13:50,137
TALIESIN: Not history, it'd be religion?

892
01:13:50,137 --> 01:13:51,366
TRAVIS: I got this.

893
01:13:51,366 --> 01:13:52,803
MARISHA: On what a goristro is?

894
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:58,110
MATT: Let me double-check just to be sure.
Specifically, this is knowledge of fiends is what

895
01:13:58,110 --> 01:13:59,230
this is.

896
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:04,141
MARISHA: Apparently, his name was Yenk. Yank?

897
01:14:04,141 --> 01:14:06,303
MATT: Yenk. Y-E-N-K.

898
01:14:06,303 --> 01:14:07,734
MARISHA and LAURA: Yenk.

899
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,320
TRAVIS: All those yanks.

900
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:14,800
TALIESIN: One day, there will be a creature whose
name we don't make fun of.

901
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,632
LIAM and TALIESIN: Not this day!

902
01:14:18,632 --> 01:14:24,329
MATT: And every creature you make fun of is going
to hurt that much more when it kills you.

903
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:28,104
TALIESIN: We are the Peter Parker of this game. We
walk around mocking things.

904
01:14:28,104 --> 01:14:30,585
MATT: It's great. It's so wonderful.

905
01:14:30,585 --> 01:14:34,283
TALIESIN: There's like this seventh ring of hell
where they're all hanging out going, "And then

906
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:35,984
"they called me Purvan."

907
01:14:35,984 --> 01:14:40,027
LIAM: "It's pronounced 'Purvin.' That's so much
better."

908
01:14:40,027 --> 01:14:43,372
TALIESIN: "I was named after my grandfather,
man."

909
01:14:43,372 --> 01:14:49,919
MATT: I'd say honestly, like I might give a
religion check or a straight intelligence check.

910
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:55,134
It's going to be a hard DC for anybody that doesn't
have any specific knowledge or training in

911
01:14:55,134 --> 01:14:56,627
anything fiend-centric.

912
01:14:56,627 --> 01:14:58,479
MARISHA: In anything fiend-centric?

913
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,877
MATT: A goristro is a fiend. It lives in the
Abyss. Most things in the abyss are fiends.

914
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:05,653
SAM: You said religion?

915
01:15:05,653 --> 01:15:11,700
MATT: I said possibly religion, if you have it
trained. If you're proficient in religion.

916
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,517
LAURA: Can Pike--

917
01:15:13,517 --> 01:15:15,679
MATT: You can go ask her.

918
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,220
MARISHA: She's here.

919
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,963
TALIESIN: I'll send one of the guards to go bring
her in.

920
01:15:21,963 --> 01:15:26,754
MATT: You wait about an hour. Pike quickly jogs
up. You hear the clanking of the armor as she

921
01:15:26,754 --> 01:15:32,156
ascends the steps. "Hey, guys! Hi! What do you
need?"

922
01:15:32,156 --> 01:15:34,365
TRAVIS: Barely heard you coming that time.

923
01:15:34,365 --> 01:15:38,224
MATT: "Oh, thank you, Grog."

924
01:15:38,224 --> 01:15:44,914
LAURA: Pike, have you ever heard of a goristro
named Yenk?

925
01:15:44,914 --> 01:15:51,176
MATT: "No?"

926
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:56,824
LAURA: Nothing? It's a fiend in the Abyss.
Anything about a goristro?

927
01:15:56,824 --> 01:16:01,194
MATT: "Fiends are bad, but I don't know anything
about a goristro."

928
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:03,859
LAURA: At least you know how to pronounce it.

929
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:12,571
TALIESIN: Do we have a library to consult?

930
01:16:12,571 --> 01:16:17,009
TRAVIS: What would be wrong with summoning it?
What if it's really bad?

931
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:23,071
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea. The worst
thing that happens is it's going to have to fight

932
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:24,242
two dragons.

933
01:16:24,242 --> 01:16:28,055
SAM: It's a cool idea, but I don't think we can.
We need to know the beast that we are summoning.

934
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:29,805
TALIESIN: We have its name.

935
01:16:29,805 --> 01:16:34,427
MARISHA: Yeah, we know what it is. Can we go to a
library, find a picture?

936
01:16:34,427 --> 01:16:36,199
LIAM: Maybe Allura knows.

937
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:42,134
LAURA: Where is Allura? We haven't seen her in
forever. She's out--

938
01:16:42,134 --> 01:16:43,704
SAM: She's a dragon.

939
01:16:43,704 --> 01:16:45,816
TALIESIN: They can't all be dragons!

940
01:16:45,816 --> 01:16:49,673
TRAVIS: I have something to confess. I farted.

941
01:16:49,673 --> 01:16:50,992
LAURA: Just now?

942
01:16:50,992 --> 01:16:52,024
TRAVIS: Yeah.

943
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:59,725
TALIESIN: Does the little black orb absorb that?
And suddenly the demon-portal-hell opens.

944
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:01,213
"Oh, that's all it took!"

945
01:17:01,213 --> 01:17:04,683
(laughter)

946
01:17:04,683 --> 01:17:11,562
MATT: What do you guys want to do?

947
01:17:11,562 --> 01:17:14,303
TALIESIN: I'm going to go research.

948
01:17:14,303 --> 01:17:16,518
LAURA: Yeah, can we go in the library and look in
the books there?

949
01:17:16,518 --> 01:17:22,391
MATT: Sure. Okay. Who's going to the library?
Okay, those two. What's everyone else doing?

950
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:24,217
LIAM: I need to talk to you for a minute.

951
01:17:24,217 --> 01:17:28,202
MARISHA: Okay. I stare blankly into space.

952
01:17:28,202 --> 01:17:38,778
MATT: Okay, roll for perception. No. 
Grog, Scanlan, what are you guys doing?

953
01:17:38,778 --> 01:17:40,871
SAM: Nothing for us to do.

954
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:44,329
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? We're the
masterminds of this portion of the adventure.

955
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:47,381
SAM: You're right. What do you want to do?

956
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:49,844
TRAVIS: I've got nothing.

957
01:17:49,844 --> 01:17:58,933
LAURA: Is there somebody religious, outside of
Pike, in the city? Oh yeah, ask Kash!

958
01:17:58,933 --> 01:18:03,966
MATT: Kash is in Vasselheim right now.

959
01:18:03,966 --> 01:18:06,171
TALIESIN: But we do have priests. We have two
priests.

960
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:08,234
MATT: You have Keeper Yennen.

961
01:18:08,234 --> 01:18:11,751
TRAVIS: Yeah, ask him about a giant fiend-beast.
I'm sure they know all about it.

962
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:16,362
SAM: All right, Grog and I will go talk to Keeper
Yennen about Yenk.

963
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:17,307
TRAVIS: Yeah.

964
01:18:17,307 --> 01:18:21,513
TALIESIN: You could also always pray to the Raven
Queen.

965
01:18:21,513 --> 01:18:23,939
LAURA: Oh yeah, you do have a shrine, after all.

966
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:30,468
MATT: We'll go with your guys' conversation first.
Vax and Keyleth.

967
01:18:30,468 --> 01:18:45,158
LIAM: Come on, that's a good idea. Let's go to the
temple. I've been thinking a lot about your longer

968
01:18:45,158 --> 01:18:52,786
life that you told me about. Once you're leading
your people, you've come into your own, yeah?

969
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:57,508
MARISHA: If I live past killing these dragons,
yeah.

970
01:18:57,508 --> 01:19:08,157
LIAM: A thousand years or so, yeah? Now, I've
thought a lot about that, and I think we should

971
01:19:08,157 --> 01:19:19,448
make a point of seeing that it happens. Well, once
you come out the other side of this. I want that

972
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:21,218
for you.

973
01:19:21,218 --> 01:19:33,643
MARISHA: What do <i>you</i> want? I have a born duty to
my people that's hard to escape.

974
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:39,415
LIAM: Well, if we're all alive in a month, we can
work that out.

975
01:19:39,415 --> 01:19:43,011
MARISHA: I guess we'll cross that bridge when we
get there.

976
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:55,384
LIAM: In the meantime, I want you to have this.
And I undo my cloak and shove it into her hands.

977
01:19:55,384 --> 01:19:58,269
MARISHA: (whispers) Which cloak?

978
01:19:58,269 --> 01:20:01,940
LIAM: I only have one. Made from the--

979
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:05,459
MARISHA: Oh, the displacer cloak.

980
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:12,148
LIAM: I'm so used to you smashing across our
enemies, shoulder-to-shoulder with Grog, I get

981
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:21,429
complacent. You're so strong. I know that. So much
more powerful than I am. Lulled me into a false

982
01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:32,372
sense of security. But I can't have you gone. I
need you here, so anything we can do to stack the

983
01:20:32,372 --> 01:20:46,343
deck in your favor. When you fell yesterday, it
shook me.

984
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:52,266
MARISHA: Seems to be a trend, watching all of us
fall.

985
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:56,984
LIAM: Kiki, will you wear that?

986
01:20:56,984 --> 01:21:10,515
MATT: You'll have to attune to it on a short rest,
but you can do that. While you guys are doing

987
01:21:10,515 --> 01:21:15,867
that, Percy and Vex, could you guys roll an
investigation check, each of you? Percy, minus

988
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:19,300
three, because you're still suffering resurrection
issues.

989
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:26,570
LAURA: Investigation? Oh! No, this has nothing to
do with dragons.

990
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:30,462
SAM: It's okay. You're fine.

991
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:32,314
LAURA: Ten.

992
01:21:32,314 --> 01:21:33,615
TALIESIN: I did.

993
01:21:33,615 --> 01:21:36,861
LAURA: Did you get a 20? Does it still count as a
20?

994
01:21:36,861 --> 01:21:39,101
TALIESIN: Yeah, a 20's a 20.

995
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:41,409
MATT: It's still minus three. What's your total?

996
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:47,604
TALIESIN: Investigation? 21, after that minus
three. But this is a natural 20.

997
01:21:47,604 --> 01:21:57,724
MATT: And ten? All righty. You guys spend the
better part of the next two hours or so poring

998
01:21:57,724 --> 01:22:00,978
through the various libraries. You know them very
well. You've read through a lot of these growing

999
01:22:00,978 --> 01:22:08,904
up. There aren't a lot of tomes or books that deal
with anything terribly fiendish. You do find one

1000
01:22:08,904 --> 01:22:20,104
that deals with tales of the Betrayer Gods. It's
more of an old history tome that deals with

1001
01:22:20,104 --> 01:22:26,555
pre-Divergence. It deals with the Founding, which
is the first era; the Age of Arcanum, which is the

1002
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:36,300
second era; this is all pre-Divergence. It speaks
of the Betrayer Gods and many of their creations

1003
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:44,354
and their followers that began to lay waste to
civilization and began to enslave the creators of

1004
01:22:44,354 --> 01:22:47,153
those that remained on the side of light.

1005
01:22:47,153 --> 01:23:02,478
You do see mention in there of various fiends and
demons and princes of evil. It's all very thick

1006
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:12,521
religious text, but there is one page that has
artwork on it. Sketched and simple, but it shows

1007
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:21,102
this strange, almost long, lithe vulture-like
creature, with wings and clawed hands, and a

1008
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:34,157
beak-like mouth, called a vrock. You see another
section that has a woman, but the lower half of

1009
01:23:34,157 --> 01:23:41,527
her body is serpentine, like a snake, and she has
six arms carrying six different blades. It says

1010
01:23:41,527 --> 01:23:49,902
"marilith." Behind them, you see a looming
creature of hulking fur and muscle with fists like

1011
01:23:49,902 --> 01:23:59,351
battering rams, a turned up, pug-like nose with a
toothy jaw, and giant horns adorned with brass

1012
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:04,223
rings that curve forward. Under that it says
"goristro."

1013
01:24:04,223 --> 01:24:05,609
LAURA: Did you find it?

1014
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:09,251
TALIESIN: Well, that's intimidating.

1015
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:12,031
LAURA: That's enormous.

1016
01:24:12,031 --> 01:24:17,587
TALIESIN: Yes. I think the dragon will be
pleased.

1017
01:24:17,587 --> 01:24:19,723
LAURA: I hope the dragon kills it.

1018
01:24:19,723 --> 01:24:21,327
TALIESIN: I'm fine either way.

1019
01:24:21,327 --> 01:24:24,665
LAURA: Well, that's helpful.

1020
01:24:24,665 --> 01:24:29,500
TALIESIN: It's very helpful. Whoever survives--

1021
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:47,378
LAURA: We kill them. No problem. Anyway! And I
leave. We should probably show everybody what we found.

1022
01:24:47,378 --> 01:24:58,988
LIAM: It feels really third-grade in here, all of
a sudden.

1023
01:24:58,988 --> 01:25:03,474
MATT: The awkward pause dissipates, and you both
bumble your way out of the library to find the others.

1024
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:05,763
TALIESIN: We both go out the door at the same
time.

1025
01:25:05,763 --> 01:25:07,136
LAURA: No, you first--

1026
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:08,333
TALIESIN: Please--

1027
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:15,146
MATT: Grog, Scanlan, you guys make your way over
to--

1028
01:25:15,146 --> 01:25:19,999
SAM: We are the worst people for this mission.

1029
01:25:19,999 --> 01:25:21,416
TRAVIS: We've got this on lock!

1030
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:32,614
MATT: There's Keeper Yennen there with his small
temple to Erathis, I believe. There's nobody in

1031
01:25:32,614 --> 01:25:40,059
there, currently. It's empty. He's sweeping up
with one of his assistants that's helping keep the

1032
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:41,765
place clean.

1033
01:25:41,765 --> 01:25:45,035
SAM: Tally-ho, Keeper Yennen.

1034
01:25:45,035 --> 01:25:49,582
MATT: "It's been some time. I'm glad to see that
you're all safe and sound."

1035
01:25:49,582 --> 01:25:57,349
SAM: Yes, well. We come seeking knowledge that
only you have. Maybe.

1036
01:25:57,349 --> 01:26:01,053
MATT: "Well, I am at your service. What can I
do?"

1037
01:26:01,053 --> 01:26:07,843
SAM: We needed some information about something
that is beyond our scope.

1038
01:26:07,843 --> 01:26:14,056
TRAVIS: Wait. I don't know if he's cool, man.
Maybe you should check him.

1039
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:19,654
SAM: Check him? All right. I'll check him.

1040
01:26:19,654 --> 01:26:21,636
MATT: "What?"

1041
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:24,426
TRAVIS: Yennen, you keep your hands where I can
see them.

1042
01:26:24,426 --> 01:26:25,952
MATT: "This is very--"

1043
01:26:25,952 --> 01:26:28,117
TRAVIS: Just keep them where I can see them.

1044
01:26:28,117 --> 01:26:30,838
MATT: He's got the broom in front.

1045
01:26:30,838 --> 01:26:34,311
SAM: I'm going to slowly touch his arms, make sure
he's real.

1046
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:39,966
MATT: Your hands meet cloth and somewhat wrinkled
older gentleman skin.

1047
01:26:39,966 --> 01:26:41,698
SAM: I'll pat him down.

1048
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:43,575
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1049
01:26:43,575 --> 01:26:46,634
SAM: 19.

1050
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:52,474
MATT: You find a small pouch, seems to contain a
few coins. A somewhat stale piece of half-eaten

1051
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:59,733
bread. A couple of unlit candles. That's about
it.

1052
01:26:59,733 --> 01:27:03,535
SAM: I sniff the bread. (sniffing) He's clean.

1053
01:27:03,535 --> 01:27:07,443
TRAVIS: All right. As you were.

1054
01:27:07,443 --> 01:27:10,709
MATT: "Most unusual."

1055
01:27:10,709 --> 01:27:12,580
TRAVIS: Don't worry. Can't be too careful.

1056
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:13,987
SAM: There's dragons around.

1057
01:27:13,987 --> 01:27:18,013
MATT: "Right, right. That's all right." He picks
the bread up off the ground and puts it back in

1058
01:27:18,013 --> 01:27:19,089
his pocket.

1059
01:27:19,089 --> 01:27:20,572
SAM: Sorry about that.

1060
01:27:20,572 --> 01:27:29,297
TRAVIS: We're actually hoping you have some
information on a fiendish beast named Lucas.

1061
01:27:29,297 --> 01:27:30,503
SAM: Nope.

1062
01:27:30,503 --> 01:27:34,550
TRAVIS: Named Victor.

1063
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:43,366
SAM: Yenk. Yenk. And he is a-- what's the type of
beast? A goristro.

1064
01:27:43,366 --> 01:27:53,723
MATT: "I have come across texts that speak of a
goristro. I do not know of one named Yenk,

1065
01:27:53,723 --> 01:27:55,413
"specifically."

1066
01:27:55,413 --> 01:28:03,492
SAM: Well, it's very important that we know his
name-- or her name-- accurately, because, well,

1067
01:28:03,492 --> 01:28:09,342
for many reasons. But we need to know its true
name. Is there any text you can point us to?

1068
01:28:09,342 --> 01:28:12,722
TRAVIS: Or tell us what you know of goristros.

1069
01:28:12,722 --> 01:28:23,868
MATT: "They were dangerous front-line behemoths
when the fiends attacked these lands, back in the

1070
01:28:23,868 --> 01:28:31,807
"pre-Divergence era. They were 20-plus feet tall
and living battering rams that tore through stone

1071
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,994
"like it was paper."

1072
01:28:33,994 --> 01:28:40,576
SAM: Force is their weapon, not fire or any
magic?

1073
01:28:40,576 --> 01:28:53,502
MATT: "I don't know the specifics, but the texts I
have read speak of it being an unstoppable fist in

1074
01:28:53,502 --> 01:28:56,905
"the service of the Dark Princes."

1075
01:28:56,905 --> 01:29:00,975
TRAVIS: Right, now, we are totally up to date on
how to fight these things, but we are also part of

1076
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:08,506
a group that's making sure you are at your best in
case they come round here. If I were to ask you

1077
01:29:08,506 --> 01:29:11,237
how to fight one of these things, what would you
bring?

1078
01:29:11,237 --> 01:29:16,514
MATT: "Everything?"

1079
01:29:16,514 --> 01:29:19,238
(laughter)

1080
01:29:19,238 --> 01:29:26,176
TRAVIS: An interesting answer. Might you be a
little less vague for my simple friend here?

1081
01:29:26,176 --> 01:29:29,211
SAM: Do they have any resistances? Acid, poison,
fire?

1082
01:29:29,211 --> 01:29:38,344
MATT: "I have no idea, unfortunately. I'm not
extremely well versed in fiendish things. I know a

1083
01:29:38,344 --> 01:29:43,033
"bit offhand from my teachings, but it's a very
specific--"

1084
01:29:43,033 --> 01:29:48,718
TRAVIS: I expected more, really. I did.

1085
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:52,564
SAM: Are we going to play bad Grog, good gnome?

1086
01:29:52,564 --> 01:29:56,698
TRAVIS: I don't even know if it's worth it, at
this point. I expected more.

1087
01:29:56,698 --> 01:29:59,924
SAM: Oh, you're going to guilt it out of him.

1088
01:29:59,924 --> 01:30:03,407
MATT: "I'm not withholding any information. I
genuinely--"

1089
01:30:03,407 --> 01:30:09,979
TRAVIS: You want to protect Whitestone, right? See
its people to prosperity?

1090
01:30:09,979 --> 01:30:11,848
MATT: "That's what I'm doing."

1091
01:30:11,848 --> 01:30:14,906
TRAVIS: All right, then, maybe you should <i>learn
more about hellish fiends!</i>

1092
01:30:14,906 --> 01:30:17,473
MATT: "We've rebuilt half the city--"

1093
01:30:17,473 --> 01:30:22,681
SAM: (voice breaking) Grog, I don't think I can--
I'm emotional thinking of all the people in

1094
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:24,680
Whitestone who are going to die.

1095
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,012
TRAVIS: Look what you've done.

1096
01:30:26,012 --> 01:30:30,903
SAM: I can't keep it together. Is there any
information you might know that can save your

1097
01:30:30,903 --> 01:30:32,365
people?

1098
01:30:32,365 --> 01:30:39,906
MATT: (strained) "I don't know!" And he rushes off
toward his room. You start hearing him turning

1099
01:30:39,961 --> 01:30:44,196
over blankets, things tumbling onto the ground.
He's tearing through his room in the back of the

1100
01:30:44,196 --> 01:30:45,229
temple.

1101
01:30:45,229 --> 01:30:46,988
TRAVIS: Well done. You've got to lick your fingers
and then wet--

1102
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:49,033
SAM: Oh, good, yeah. Ooh.

1103
01:30:49,033 --> 01:30:56,143
MATT: About ten minutes go by before he comes out,
sweat pouring down his face. He's like, (panting)

1104
01:30:56,143 --> 01:30:59,795
"I have nothing. I'm sorry."

1105
01:30:59,795 --> 01:31:10,188
TRAVIS: It's all right. We all have room to
improve. I suppose we know now where yours lies.

1106
01:31:10,188 --> 01:31:17,027
You have your orders. Don't make me tell Percy
about this.

1107
01:31:17,027 --> 01:31:19,061
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1108
01:31:19,061 --> 01:31:22,516
LIAM: That guy's going to go back to his room and
flagellate himself.

1109
01:31:22,516 --> 01:31:25,403
SAM: We're shaking down our friend.

1110
01:31:25,403 --> 01:31:27,093
TRAVIS: 24.

1111
01:31:27,093 --> 01:31:36,794
MATT: He goes, "Yes, right, of course. I will
further my research, and perhaps I could send

1112
01:31:36,794 --> 01:31:44,482
"someone to scour the rubble of the Cobalt Reserve.
It may take a couple weeks. I'm so sorry."

1113
01:31:44,482 --> 01:31:49,510
TRAVIS: Not a bad idea. You've done lovely work in
here, by the way. The rebuilding effort looks great.

1114
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:50,891
MATT: "Thank you."

1115
01:31:50,891 --> 01:31:53,507
TRAVIS: I'd like to see that passion in the rest
of your projects, that's all.

1116
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:57,994
SAM: Is there anyone else who has knowledge that
you can think of that we should speak to?

1117
01:31:57,994 --> 01:32:02,268
MATT: "Not that still lives in the city,
unfortunately. You're in the service of the

1118
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:09,121
"greatest minds of our city now, up in the castle.
We're trying to put homes up for those who need them."

1119
01:32:09,121 --> 01:32:10,472
TRAVIS: Shit.

1120
01:32:10,472 --> 01:32:11,593
LAURA: Yeah.

1121
01:32:11,593 --> 01:32:13,815
SAM: Thank you for your service to Whitestone.

1122
01:32:13,815 --> 01:32:16,346
MATT: "Also, thank you for yours."

1123
01:32:16,346 --> 01:32:21,160
SAM: We've had a weird, rough week, so sorry if
we--

1124
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,191
MATT: "Apparently, now so have I."

1125
01:32:23,191 --> 01:32:31,532
TRAVIS: Just curious, do you need any money for
these homes? Or anything?

1126
01:32:31,532 --> 01:32:34,144
MATT: "Cassandra's taking care of the costs."

1127
01:32:34,144 --> 01:32:35,765
TRAVIS: Right. Shit.

1128
01:32:35,765 --> 01:32:39,818
MATT: "She's sending up materials from the Turst
Fields."

1129
01:32:39,818 --> 01:32:44,677
TRAVIS: You should know, we've been taking surveys
around the town, like, "A, B, C, people most

1130
01:32:44,677 --> 01:32:49,892
"important in the rebuilding of Whitestone," and
role models, and you're always the first name.

1131
01:32:49,892 --> 01:32:51,312
Isn't that right, Scanlan?

1132
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:53,630
SAM: I don't think we can talk our way out of this
one.

1133
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:57,760
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to make him feel better.
It's you.

1134
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,421
SAM: You're top five in Whitestone, for sure.

1135
01:32:59,421 --> 01:33:05,169
MATT: "I appreciate-- It's very kind."

1136
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:08,211
TRAVIS: You're doing good work. (strained) All
right.

1137
01:33:08,211 --> 01:33:10,773
MATT: "I have a lot of sweeping to do, if you
don't mind."

1138
01:33:10,773 --> 01:33:17,035
SAM: We did a good thing in there, Grog.

1139
01:33:17,035 --> 01:33:25,897
MATT: The assistant is over there wide-eyed,
watching this whole circumstance. He's a young,

1140
01:33:25,897 --> 01:33:31,529
maybe 17-year-old boy in a similar robe.
"Sebastian, stop staring and help me clean!"

1141
01:33:31,529 --> 01:33:35,715
"Yes, sir!" They both start sweeping the rest of
the temple as you guys walk out.

1142
01:33:35,715 --> 01:33:38,003
SAM: He's going to kill you someday.

1143
01:33:38,003 --> 01:33:40,248
TRAVIS: We clearly got the most info out of
anybody.

1144
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:43,810
SAM: I think we got all there was. High-five.

1145
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:48,903
MATT: All right. The two of you finally make your
way to the recently constructed temple of the

1146
01:33:48,903 --> 01:33:52,604
Raven Queen that Percy had built. What would you
like to do?

1147
01:33:52,604 --> 01:33:56,237
LIAM: I want to go in and have a moment. Pray.

1148
01:33:56,237 --> 01:33:58,085
MATT: Okay.

1149
01:33:58,085 --> 01:34:09,412
LIAM: So I will go in and kneel down where
Percival showed me and stay quiet for a few

1150
01:34:09,412 --> 01:34:27,741
minutes, then ask a couple of questions. I haven't
spoken in a while. I'm trying to grow stronger.

1151
01:34:27,741 --> 01:34:55,400
Whatever it is you need. Maybe it is selfish, but
I seek vengeance against my mother's killer. Once

1152
01:34:55,400 --> 01:35:14,039
I have it, I will go to the ends of this world for
you. To help me go stronger, is there anything you

1153
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:25,475
can tell me about the fiend named Yenk? We need to
use it.

1154
01:35:25,475 --> 01:35:30,114
MATT: Roll a religion check.

1155
01:35:30,114 --> 01:35:34,069
LAURA: You can do it!

1156
01:35:34,069 --> 01:35:40,158
LIAM: I will stick with that. No, I'll stick with
that. 21.

1157
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:49,889
MATT: 21. The door still left ajar to the temple
as Keyleth walked in earlier, a bit of a breeze

1158
01:35:49,889 --> 01:35:56,437
swirls in for a second, carrying a few leaves.
They scatter around, come to rest. The candles

1159
01:35:56,437 --> 01:36:06,754
flicker for a moment and the light dims ever so
slightly. Nothing beyond that from your

1160
01:36:06,754 --> 01:36:16,197
perspective, Keyleth. You, Vax, feel a familiar
cold embrace. It's interesting. It's chilling and

1161
01:36:16,197 --> 01:36:25,579
causes your skin to goosebump, but it's still
comforting. While you see nothing within your

1162
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:37,934
closed eyes, you can sense a pair of cold lips to
your left ear that whispers toward you, "Knowledge

1163
01:36:37,934 --> 01:36:55,423
"of this is earned. You seek this with your allies.
Some have already found secrets. I can only say

1164
01:36:55,423 --> 01:37:12,163
"that the path you walked to the sphinx gave you
what you need. Stay alive." You feel the lips fade

1165
01:37:12,163 --> 01:37:18,473
from your ear. Warmth comes back to your sides,
and your eyes flicker open, knowing that her

1166
01:37:18,473 --> 01:37:20,331
presence is no longer there.

1167
01:37:20,331 --> 01:37:26,050
MARISHA: Any luck?

1168
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:34,751
LIAM: Sort of. She told me something, but I'm too
stupid to understand.

1169
01:37:34,751 --> 01:37:44,543
MARISHA: I don't think that's true. Gods really
enjoy being vague. What'd she say?

1170
01:37:44,543 --> 01:37:51,521
LIAM: She said that the path to the sphinx told us
everything we want to know.

1171
01:37:51,521 --> 01:37:55,347
MARISHA: Which sphinx? We've seen two now.

1172
01:37:55,347 --> 01:37:58,205
LIAM: She didn't say.

1173
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:01,323
MARISHA: Damn it. Why do they have to be so
cryptic?

1174
01:38:01,323 --> 01:38:04,140
LIAM: Because they can.

1175
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,446
MARISHA: Ugh.

1176
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:10,015
LIAM: Come here. That's on crooked.

1177
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:17,115
MARISHA: I don't think I wear it as well as you.
It's a little baggy.

1178
01:38:17,115 --> 01:38:24,340
LIAM: Here's to a thousand years of you.

1179
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:28,149
MARISHA: That made me a little nauseous. Let's
go.

1180
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:34,355
MATT: As you guys all go to convene in Castle
Whitestone to discuss the next length of your

1181
01:38:34,355 --> 01:38:41,136
plan, we're going to take a restroom break. See
you guys back here in a few minutes. Thank you

1182
01:38:41,136 --> 01:38:45,332
once again, Loot Crate, for being awesome, our
sponsor. Thank you guys for sticking around. See

1183
01:38:45,332 --> 01:38:48,019
you guys in a minute.

1184
01:38:48,019 --> 01:38:51,000
LAURA: "Is it Thursday yet?" Did you almost say
"Is it Thursday yet?"

1185
01:38:51,000 --> 01:57:03,616
[break]

1186
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:08,836
MATT: Welcome back everybody from the break.
Before we get started, I wanted to bring this up

1187
01:57:08,836 --> 01:57:14,082
in case you guys were not aware. I was made aware
of it at the end of last week, but they announced

1188
01:57:14,082 --> 01:57:21,092
Twitch Prime. What that allows is for anybody out
there that has an Amazon Prime account you get

1189
01:57:21,092 --> 01:57:25,786
automatically one free subscription to a Twitch
channel of your choice, so if you are not a

1190
01:57:25,786 --> 01:57:29,395
subscriber to Geek and Sundry's Twitch, to help
support the show, and you have an Amazon Prime

1191
01:57:29,395 --> 01:57:31,952
account, you can do that now, free of charge.

1192
01:57:31,952 --> 01:57:34,292
TRAVIS: You'll be in the chat room; you'll get all
the goodies.

1193
01:57:34,292 --> 01:57:37,234
MATT: All the goodies, you'll have access to the
VODs immediately. You won't have to wait until

1194
01:57:37,234 --> 01:57:40,820
Monday for the YouTube videos to come out for the
episodes, and it is of no additional cost to you

1195
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:44,322
as long as you have a Prime membership. I wanted
to make sure you guys were aware of that, because

1196
01:57:44,322 --> 01:57:45,932
I was recently made aware of that.

1197
01:57:45,932 --> 01:57:55,458
All righty. Picking up where we left off, the rest
of you guys have done some research, gathered some

1198
01:57:55,458 --> 01:58:00,701
information that may or may not be helpful. What
do you want to do for the rest of your preparation

1199
01:58:00,701 --> 01:58:02,564
for whatever you wish to do going forward?

1200
01:58:02,564 --> 01:58:03,875
LIAM: This is before beddy-bye time?

1201
01:58:03,875 --> 01:58:05,095
MATT: Yeah, you guys are still--

1202
01:58:05,095 --> 01:58:07,632
TALIESIN: I've a few things I think we should do.

1203
01:58:07,632 --> 01:58:08,915
LAURA: Okay?

1204
01:58:08,915 --> 01:58:10,575
MARISHA: I think there's a lot we need to do.

1205
01:58:10,575 --> 01:58:12,573
TALIESIN: First, I think we should brew some tea
and not drink it.

1206
01:58:12,573 --> 01:58:17,968
LAURA: Oh. It only lasts for how long?

1207
01:58:17,968 --> 01:58:19,166
TRAVIS: What?

1208
01:58:19,166 --> 01:58:20,846
LAURA: The venomous tea.

1209
01:58:20,846 --> 01:58:22,873
MATT: It'll probably last for the day.

1210
01:58:22,873 --> 01:58:24,992
LAURA: All right, yeah. It'll last for 24 hours.

1211
01:58:24,992 --> 01:58:28,070
SAM: So wait, you want to make poison and not do
anything with it?

1212
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:29,437
LAURA: We'll keep it.

1213
01:58:29,437 --> 01:58:30,473
MARISHA: Just in case.

1214
01:58:30,473 --> 01:58:32,924
SAM: In case someone comes over for tea?

1215
01:58:32,924 --> 01:58:33,862
MARISHA: Emergency poison.

1216
01:58:33,862 --> 01:58:37,289
TRAVIS: Why wouldn't you make it in front of her,
and then it's <i>way</i> less conspicuous.

1217
01:58:37,289 --> 01:58:44,830
LAURA: (gasps) That's true! Let's make some and
put it a flask, and then we'll do it later.

1218
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:46,352
LIAM: Are you talking about for Raishan?

1219
01:58:46,352 --> 01:58:47,903
TALIESIN: No, just to have some poison.

1220
01:58:47,903 --> 01:58:49,182
LIAM: She's a poisonous dragon.

1221
01:58:49,182 --> 01:58:51,133
LAURA: Just to have some poison in general. Not
necessarily for Raishan.

1222
01:58:51,133 --> 01:58:52,727
TALIESIN: Maybe we'll make it in the morning.

1223
01:58:52,727 --> 01:58:54,138
LIAM: Maybe an enemy will come over. You're
right.

1224
01:58:54,138 --> 01:58:56,628
MARISHA: Maybe an enemy will come over.

1225
01:58:56,628 --> 01:59:04,399
MATT: As a specific master of dragon and dragon
knowledge, so you're aware, green dragons are--

1226
01:59:04,399 --> 01:59:06,297
LAURA: Poison.

1227
01:59:06,297 --> 01:59:07,786
MATT: Poison by nature.

1228
01:59:07,786 --> 01:59:09,153
LAURA: I don't think this is for Raishan!

1229
01:59:09,153 --> 01:59:10,021
MATT: Okay.

1230
01:59:10,021 --> 01:59:16,242
TALIESIN: I was actually thinking if we had a bit
of poison and if we could get it into the system

1231
01:59:16,242 --> 01:59:19,261
of one of the larger creatures at some point. A
big pot of poison, maybe.

1232
01:59:19,261 --> 01:59:22,255
LAURA: I knew you didn't think it was for
Raishan.

1233
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:25,076
TALIESIN: Raishan's not going to drink tea and
die.

1234
01:59:25,076 --> 01:59:27,968
MARISHA: Right, internet? We knew it wasn't for
Raishan.

1235
01:59:27,968 --> 01:59:30,283
MATT: (laughs) All right.

1236
01:59:30,283 --> 01:59:37,500
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to go downstairs, and I
want to see if Grog will give me all of the guns

1237
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:41,032
to go upstairs and look at our giant cache of guns
that we suddenly have.

1238
01:59:41,032 --> 01:59:44,749
MARISHA and TALIESIN: All the guns.

1239
01:59:44,749 --> 01:59:56,984
SAM: That reminds me. On the walk home with Grog,
I turn to him and say: Oi, Grog, got any of those guns?

1240
01:59:56,984 --> 01:59:58,017
TRAVIS: I do!

1241
01:59:58,017 --> 01:59:59,193
SAM: How many?

1242
01:59:59,193 --> 02:00:06,965
TRAVIS: Two pistols, two rifles, really long
skinny guy. And I've got a greatsword.

1243
02:00:06,965 --> 02:00:15,145
SAM: Why should Percy have all the fun? What say
you and me take a pistol each, just as a backup

1244
02:00:15,145 --> 02:00:17,142
plan? An insurance policy.

1245
02:00:17,142 --> 02:00:19,449
TRAVIS: I don't want a pistol. How about you take
one?

1246
02:00:19,449 --> 02:00:21,978
SAM: You don't want a pistol?

1247
02:00:21,978 --> 02:00:22,986
TRAVIS: No!

1248
02:00:22,986 --> 02:00:24,667
SAM: You'd look so cool!

1249
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:26,452
TRAVIS: It's not as intimate as what I do.

1250
02:00:26,452 --> 02:00:29,555
SAM: You are about the personal touch.

1251
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:30,942
TRAVIS: I need the connection.

1252
02:00:30,942 --> 02:00:35,518
TALIESIN: What are the actual chances that he will
even know how to operate it? I'm not talking to

1253
02:00:35,518 --> 02:00:39,612
either of you. I'm talking to the powers that be.

1254
02:00:39,612 --> 02:00:44,782
TRAVIS: It'd be like a little GI Joe handgun. Do
you want a pistol?

1255
02:00:44,782 --> 02:00:46,689
SAM: Do you have any ammo?

1256
02:00:46,689 --> 02:00:50,275
TRAVIS: I do. I have 185 rounds.

1257
02:00:50,275 --> 02:00:52,518
SAM: Holy shit!

1258
02:00:52,518 --> 02:00:56,794
TRAVIS: So I take out one of the two pistols. Do
they look the same?

1259
02:00:56,794 --> 02:00:58,933
MATT: They look comparable, yes.

1260
02:00:58,933 --> 02:01:00,087
TRAVIS: Which one?

1261
02:01:00,087 --> 02:01:03,298
SAM: Is there any blood on either of them?

1262
02:01:03,298 --> 02:01:04,535
TRAVIS: Are there?

1263
02:01:04,535 --> 02:01:06,500
MATT: A little smattering on each of them, yeah.

1264
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,113
TRAVIS: I'll give you the super bloody one.

1265
02:01:08,113 --> 02:01:09,225
SAM: I want the bloody one.

1266
02:01:09,225 --> 02:01:12,497
TRAVIS: Yeah! I toss it to him, and I give him--

1267
02:01:12,497 --> 02:01:15,381
LAURA: Six ammo. (laughs)

1268
02:01:15,381 --> 02:01:18,811
TRAVIS: (laughs) 15 rounds of ammo.

1269
02:01:18,811 --> 02:01:26,528
SAM: Thank you, Grog. Thank you very much. I don't
know what to do with this, so I'll pocket it.

1270
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:30,023
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure if you look into it--

1271
02:01:30,023 --> 02:01:32,631
LAURA: Don't even encourage that--

1272
02:01:32,631 --> 02:01:36,619
SAM: I've seen Percy do that a lot. Stares right
down the barrel and make sure it's working.

1273
02:01:36,619 --> 02:01:39,055
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's where the expression comes
from: "right down the barrel."

1274
02:01:39,055 --> 02:01:43,965
TALIESIN: Don't do that at home, kids. Just don't
do that.

1275
02:01:43,965 --> 02:01:46,044
LAURA: Just don't.

1276
02:01:46,044 --> 02:01:51,316
MATT: All right, so you go looking for Grog who is
not around the castle, and eventually, as you step

1277
02:01:51,316 --> 02:01:55,026
out, you notice Scanlan and Grog both walking up
the pathway to the front of Whitestone Castle.

1278
02:01:55,026 --> 02:01:58,890
TALIESIN: Oh good! We need to go through the guns,
we need to see what we have, we need to clean them

1279
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,782
up. I've got a plan.

1280
02:02:00,782 --> 02:02:07,628
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, yeah. We need to-- (sniffs)
<i>you</i> need to clean up the guns.

1281
02:02:07,628 --> 02:02:09,519
TALIESIN: I do. I need to clean up the guns.

1282
02:02:09,519 --> 02:02:12,646
TRAVIS: Who has those guns? <i>I</i> have the guns.

1283
02:02:12,646 --> 02:02:14,990
TALIESIN: You do. That's right; you were very
clever.

1284
02:02:14,990 --> 02:02:16,483
TRAVIS: What you have?

1285
02:02:16,483 --> 02:02:25,935
TALIESIN: I have a book. It's a very nice book.

1286
02:02:25,935 --> 02:02:27,956
TRAVIS: Are you joking?

1287
02:02:27,956 --> 02:02:30,651
TALIESIN: No! No, I have a cloak. Would you like a
cloak?

1288
02:02:30,651 --> 02:02:31,925
TRAVIS: For what?

1289
02:02:31,925 --> 02:02:35,152
TALIESIN: The guns. I thought we were making a
trade here.

1290
02:02:35,152 --> 02:02:36,744
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we are.

1291
02:02:36,744 --> 02:02:38,497
TALIESIN: All right, do you want a cloak, then?

1292
02:02:38,497 --> 02:02:39,950
LIAM: A Vestige?

1293
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:41,688
TALIESIN: No, I've just got a cloak.

1294
02:02:41,688 --> 02:02:43,965
(laughter)

1295
02:02:43,965 --> 02:02:44,895
TRAVIS: What does it do?

1296
02:02:44,895 --> 02:02:47,438
TALIESIN: It looks smashing, and it's quite warm.

1297
02:02:47,438 --> 02:02:48,818
TRAVIS: It's a cloak of smashing?

1298
02:02:48,818 --> 02:02:50,475
TALIESIN: Yes, it is a cloak of smashing.

1299
02:02:50,475 --> 02:02:55,126
TRAVIS: Deal. All right. I will trade you that for
the long barrel thing.

1300
02:02:55,126 --> 02:02:56,524
TALIESIN: I'll need them all.

1301
02:02:56,524 --> 02:02:57,777
TRAVIS: In a minute.

1302
02:02:57,777 --> 02:02:59,962
TALIESIN: No, I need them all. I really don't have
anything else.

1303
02:02:59,962 --> 02:03:02,009
SAM: You don't have any guns? What happened to
your guns?

1304
02:03:02,009 --> 02:03:03,773
TALIESIN: Well, no. I need to clean--

1305
02:03:03,773 --> 02:03:05,280
TRAVIS: What about your glasses?

1306
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,022
TALIESIN: (chuckles) I sort of need those
glasses--

1307
02:03:09,022 --> 02:03:10,066
TRAVIS: Do you?

1308
02:03:10,066 --> 02:03:11,125
TALIESIN: Yes.

1309
02:03:11,125 --> 02:03:16,176
TRAVIS: Give me your glasses. Just let me hold
them. Show us some faith.

1310
02:03:16,176 --> 02:03:19,330
SAM: We're friends here, right, Grog?

1311
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:21,948
TALIESIN: Is everybody here? Is everybody watching
us?

1312
02:03:21,948 --> 02:03:25,985
MATT: Just the three of you guys and three guards
back by the front of the castle.

1313
02:03:25,985 --> 02:03:30,976
SAM: I don't know what he's doing. I would not
trust him. But then again, you don't have a choice.

1314
02:03:30,976 --> 02:03:34,659
TALIESIN: I don't trust him, either. I did have
siblings; I'm aware of how this happens.

1315
02:03:34,659 --> 02:03:38,935
TRAVIS: How many fingers am I holding up?

1316
02:03:38,935 --> 02:03:40,267
TALIESIN: Four.

1317
02:03:40,267 --> 02:03:41,863
TRAVIS: Was he right?

1318
02:03:41,863 --> 02:03:43,047
SAM: He was right!

1319
02:03:43,047 --> 02:03:45,782
TRAVIS: I don't know why you need the glasses.

1320
02:03:45,782 --> 02:03:48,475
TALIESIN: I need the glasses because I can't see
things that are up close. I can see things that

1321
02:03:48,475 --> 02:03:50,153
are far away perfectly fine.

1322
02:03:50,153 --> 02:03:54,693
TRAVIS: How many fingers am I holding up?

1323
02:03:54,693 --> 02:03:56,130
TALIESIN: I don't know.

1324
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:57,286
TRAVIS: Is he right?

1325
02:03:57,286 --> 02:03:58,369
SAM: He doesn't know.

1326
02:03:58,369 --> 02:03:59,881
(laughter)

1327
02:03:59,881 --> 02:04:04,867
TRAVIS: Very well. You passed. Glasses. And I give
him the two rifles.

1328
02:04:04,867 --> 02:04:07,869
TALIESIN: He also has Ripley's gun?

1329
02:04:07,869 --> 02:04:08,902
MATT: Yes.

1330
02:04:08,902 --> 02:04:16,057
TALIESIN: Why don't we come inside so I can
explain to you my plan so that you can feel good--

1331
02:04:16,057 --> 02:04:19,027
TRAVIS: No, this is very important for me out
here. I have a position of power, and I'm not

1332
02:04:19,027 --> 02:04:23,019
about to give it up. What else have you got?

1333
02:04:23,019 --> 02:04:27,748
TALIESIN: I have a title. I can title you.

1334
02:04:27,748 --> 02:04:29,678
SAM: Oh, yes! Title him!

1335
02:04:29,678 --> 02:04:32,316
TALIESIN: Would you like a title?

1336
02:04:32,316 --> 02:04:36,455
TRAVIS: Take note, Scanlan: this is how you get
shit done. I'm listening.

1337
02:04:36,455 --> 02:04:42,698
TALIESIN: All right, I will title you if you give
me everything that I need. I need all the

1338
02:04:42,698 --> 02:04:48,188
ammunition, all the guns, especially the
complicated guns. I'm going to need everything.

1339
02:04:48,188 --> 02:04:53,874
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have one other pistol, I have 170
rounds for the little bitty guy, and I've got 26

1340
02:04:53,874 --> 02:04:56,228
rounds for the (belches) rifles.

1341
02:04:56,228 --> 02:04:57,593
TALIESIN: All right.

1342
02:04:57,593 --> 02:04:59,386
TRAVIS: Do you want the full plate armor and the
greatsword, too?

1343
02:04:59,386 --> 02:05:02,036
TALIESIN: No, plate armor and greatsword are
completely up to you.

1344
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:06,253
TRAVIS: (belches) Okay. I give it all over. What's
my title?

1345
02:05:06,253 --> 02:05:16,180
TALIESIN: Grand Poobah de Doink of All of This and
That.

1346
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:19,920
SAM: Grand Poobah de Doink of All of This and
That.

1347
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:26,039
TALIESIN: Of <i>All</i> of This and That. It comes with
no money and no land, but it is a title.

1348
02:05:26,039 --> 02:05:34,558
SAM: I'm unfamiliar with protocol. A Grand Poobah,
how do you address them? Is it a "your Majesty," a

1349
02:05:34,558 --> 02:05:36,509
"your Highness," "your Grace?"

1350
02:05:36,509 --> 02:05:39,068
TALIESIN: No it's "Hey you, over there." "Hey, you
guy."

1351
02:05:39,068 --> 02:05:40,483
SAM: Hey, you guy.

1352
02:05:40,483 --> 02:05:43,519
TRAVIS: Yes, my humble servants.

1353
02:05:43,519 --> 02:05:45,736
TALIESIN: "Sweet chestnut."

1354
02:05:45,736 --> 02:05:47,682
TRAVIS: Are those all official names?

1355
02:05:47,682 --> 02:05:49,916
TALIESIN: Oh, yes. They're used in very different
ways.

1356
02:05:49,916 --> 02:05:53,896
TRAVIS: Well look, let's keep it on the low-low,
right, I don't want too many people getting

1357
02:05:53,896 --> 02:05:58,432
jealous, so like only in private quarters will you
address me by my <i>official</i> title.

1358
02:05:58,432 --> 02:06:00,597
TALIESIN: Okay, or the shortened versions
thereof.

1359
02:06:00,597 --> 02:06:03,203
TRAVIS: Yeah, which I look forward to learning.

1360
02:06:03,203 --> 02:06:06,348
TALIESIN: You will enjoy them. I'm sure we will
all enjoy them.

1361
02:06:06,348 --> 02:06:07,841
SAM: This is a great day, Grog.

1362
02:06:07,841 --> 02:06:13,962
TRAVIS: It is, right? Man, I just keep coming up
in the world. Coming up, against all the odds. I

1363
02:06:13,962 --> 02:06:19,501
feel like an Eminem song in the background right
now. Eight Mile, bitches. Let's go inside.

1364
02:06:19,501 --> 02:06:26,190
TALIESIN: Didn't even bother to insight check, did
you? That's great. That makes me so happy.

1365
02:06:26,190 --> 02:06:30,542
SAM: Percy, don't forget, you promised me one
of those guns.

1366
02:06:30,542 --> 02:06:33,863
TALIESIN: I'd actually have to teach you how to
use it, you are aware of that?

1367
02:06:33,863 --> 02:06:38,175
SAM: Maybe you can teach me first, and when I've
learned, you can give me one.

1368
02:06:38,175 --> 02:06:44,085
TALIESIN: Maybe we'll have that conversation. I'm
going to take a look at their various levels of

1369
02:06:44,085 --> 02:06:48,506
repair. I want to take a look at how they look,
how many of them need work, how many of them are

1370
02:06:48,506 --> 02:06:49,660
at least functional.

1371
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:54,769
MATT: Most of them need work. A number of them
backfired during the actual battle, and the other

1372
02:06:54,769 --> 02:07:00,498
ones were not taken very good care of, so you're
probably going to need to run a few repair checks

1373
02:07:00,498 --> 02:07:03,036
on that. You have the materials at your disposal,
you have your workshop.

1374
02:07:03,036 --> 02:07:12,126
TALIESIN: I'm going to do this not in private, but
I'm going to be, then I want to look at Ripley's gun.

1375
02:07:12,126 --> 02:07:16,442
MATT: Okay. You take a good solid look at Animus,
get a feel for it.

1376
02:07:16,442 --> 02:07:18,361
TRAVIS: I've got it!

1377
02:07:18,361 --> 02:07:22,033
MATT: Thank you, Travis.

1378
02:07:22,033 --> 02:07:24,561
SAM: (belches)

1379
02:07:24,561 --> 02:07:26,191
LAURA: Wow.

1380
02:07:26,191 --> 02:07:28,517
TALIESIN: Oh my god, really?

1381
02:07:28,517 --> 02:07:30,649
LIAM: That was Laura Bailey-esque.

1382
02:07:30,649 --> 02:07:33,996
TRAVIS: Can I find Vax while he's looking for the
gun?

1383
02:07:33,996 --> 02:07:35,120
MATT: Yep.

1384
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:38,464
LAURA: Yeah, I want to go find Vax and Keyleth, as
well.

1385
02:07:38,464 --> 02:07:40,372
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I meant Vex.

1386
02:07:40,372 --> 02:07:41,530
LAURA: Oh, me?

1387
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:42,498
TRAVIS: Yeah, you.

1388
02:07:42,498 --> 02:07:44,705
LAURA: You want to find me? Hi, what's up?

1389
02:07:44,705 --> 02:07:48,172
TRAVIS: Hey, so remember when you showed me your
boobies during the fight with Kern?

1390
02:07:48,172 --> 02:07:49,584
LAURA: Oh, you saw them?

1391
02:07:49,584 --> 02:07:52,435
TRAVIS: Only out of the peripheral.

1392
02:07:52,435 --> 02:07:53,953
LAURA: Okay, yes?

1393
02:07:53,953 --> 02:07:58,080
TRAVIS: I wanted to say thank you on a very
delayed timeline by giving you this potion of

1394
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,499
superior healing.

1395
02:07:59,499 --> 02:08:04,221
(laughter)

1396
02:08:04,221 --> 02:08:05,799
LAURA: Thank you <i>so</i> much, Grog.

1397
02:08:05,799 --> 02:08:09,700
TRAVIS: Yeah, so if they ever get jacked up again,
heal them, because I fight better with boobies

1398
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,958
around.

1399
02:08:10,958 --> 02:08:12,200
LAURA: I'll remember that.

1400
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:12,985
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

1401
02:08:12,985 --> 02:08:13,869
LAURA: All right.

1402
02:08:13,869 --> 02:08:14,669
TRAVIS: Deal.

1403
02:08:14,669 --> 02:08:15,711
LAURA: Thank you so much.

1404
02:08:15,711 --> 02:08:16,631
TALIESIN: This is mean.

1405
02:08:16,631 --> 02:08:18,123
LIAM: That was spectacular.

1406
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:23,872
TALIESIN: I missed everything. I'll watch it on
the preview because this is a--

1407
02:08:23,872 --> 02:08:27,217
MARISHA: Isn't it breast cancer awareness month?
It is, right?

1408
02:08:27,217 --> 02:08:28,756
TALIESIN: Now I'm aware.

1409
02:08:28,756 --> 02:08:30,092
MARISHA: Check your boobs, ladies.

1410
02:08:30,092 --> 02:08:31,320
LAURA: It's important.

1411
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:33,306
LIAM: Don't let them get jacked up.

1412
02:08:33,306 --> 02:08:46,950
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to do my best to clean
and work on these guns tonight, and at some point,

1413
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:49,231
I'm going to send a guard to find Vax.

1414
02:08:49,231 --> 02:08:55,326
MATT: Vex, you've gone and looked for Vax and
Keyleth. After you guys had your conversation

1415
02:08:55,326 --> 02:09:01,217
about everything, eventually you catch up to-- are
you guys still together? Yeah, so you find the two

1416
02:09:01,217 --> 02:09:02,189
of them.

1417
02:09:02,189 --> 02:09:04,172
LAURA: Hey, did you find anything?

1418
02:09:04,172 --> 02:09:07,628
LIAM: Sort of. I wanted to talk to you and
probably Percival, as well.

1419
02:09:07,628 --> 02:09:09,280
LAURA: Yes?

1420
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:16,286
LIAM: Well, I communed with my deity--

1421
02:09:16,286 --> 02:09:20,028
LAURA and MARISHA: The Raven Queen.

1422
02:09:20,028 --> 02:09:24,884
LIAM: That's the one! And she said something that
I don't know what she meant.

1423
02:09:24,884 --> 02:09:26,120
LAURA: Okay.

1424
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:33,152
LIAM: I asked about this Yenk, and she said
everything we needed to know we saw on the way to

1425
02:09:33,152 --> 02:09:34,805
the sphinx.

1426
02:09:34,805 --> 02:09:36,308
LAURA: Which one?

1427
02:09:36,308 --> 02:09:37,852
MARISHA: That's what I said!

1428
02:09:37,852 --> 02:09:40,099
LIAM: She didn't say.

1429
02:09:40,099 --> 02:09:41,175
LAURA: Okay.

1430
02:09:41,175 --> 02:09:43,346
LIAM: I'm drawing a blank, I don't know.

1431
02:09:43,346 --> 02:09:45,889
LAURA: Everything we need, we saw on the way to
the sphinx.

1432
02:09:45,889 --> 02:09:51,230
LIAM: So I remember the more recent trip better.
What happened the first time?

1433
02:09:51,230 --> 02:09:53,100
LAURA: Well, it's here--

1434
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:54,288
LIAM: It was under the Slayer's Take.

1435
02:09:54,288 --> 02:09:55,154
LAURA: No.

1436
02:09:55,154 --> 02:09:56,443
LIAM: Yes, under the Slayer's Take.

1437
02:09:56,443 --> 02:09:57,916
LAURA: But there was a ziggurat, as well.

1438
02:09:57,916 --> 02:10:02,279
LIAM: Yes. Then the second time--

1439
02:10:02,279 --> 02:10:06,017
LAURA: We went down a cavern, and there was a
name.

1440
02:10:06,017 --> 02:10:08,020
MARISHA: Right. Had to do the whole name trial.

1441
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:09,174
LIAM: Grog almost drowned.

1442
02:10:09,174 --> 02:10:16,650
MARISHA: So the first one was near where the
Cindergrove is.

1443
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:19,565
LAURA: Right, and she worshipped the goddess of
knowledge.

1444
02:10:19,565 --> 02:10:23,119
MARISHA: Osysa was her name.

1445
02:10:23,119 --> 02:10:25,367
LIAM: We just spoke to her.

1446
02:10:25,367 --> 02:10:34,483
MATT: Osysa was the gynosphinx who works at the
Slayer's Take. The goddess she worships is Ioun.

1447
02:10:34,483 --> 02:10:36,163
LAURA and MARISHA: Ioun!

1448
02:10:36,163 --> 02:10:45,649
LAURA: So maybe we need to talk to Ioun, no? Maybe
we just talk to a god. That's impossible unless you're--

1449
02:10:45,649 --> 02:10:51,387
LIAM: I just did it, yeah, but I didn't understand
what she told me, so six of one, half a dozen of

1450
02:10:51,387 --> 02:10:52,484
the other.

1451
02:10:52,484 --> 02:10:55,198
LAURA: Worthless, really. Yeah. That's a nice
cloak you have there, Keyleth.

1452
02:10:55,198 --> 02:10:59,387
MARISHA: It's a little baggy, but thank you.

1453
02:10:59,387 --> 02:11:03,489
LIAM: I gave you a cloak once, and you stopped
using it.

1454
02:11:03,489 --> 02:11:11,733
LAURA: This is true. It looks lovely, though,
stacked next to the rest of my clothing. Do you

1455
02:11:11,733 --> 02:11:13,492
want it back?

1456
02:11:13,492 --> 02:11:15,080
LIAM: No, I do not want it back.

1457
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:21,929
LAURA: He only gives cloaks to those he really
cares about, Keyleth. Really cares about.

1458
02:11:21,929 --> 02:11:27,849
LIAM: This is really awkward, and I'm going to
walk the fuck out of here. Good night, ladies.

1459
02:11:27,849 --> 02:11:31,751
MARISHA: I got a wink from Vex!

1460
02:11:31,751 --> 02:11:36,574
LIAM: I go off looking for Percy.

1461
02:11:36,574 --> 02:11:43,048
TALIESIN: Good man.

1462
02:11:43,048 --> 02:11:47,079
MATT: While they share their awkward smile, you
find Percival down in his workshop, currently

1463
02:11:47,079 --> 02:11:52,490
repairing weaponry with Ripley's gun placed down
out on its own in the middle of the table.

1464
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:53,891
LIAM: Hello?

1465
02:11:53,891 --> 02:11:55,397
TALIESIN: Oh, good. It's you.

1466
02:11:55,397 --> 02:11:56,595
LIAM: Do you mind?

1467
02:11:56,595 --> 02:11:58,657
TALIESIN: Not at all. I was actually hoping you
would stop in.

1468
02:11:58,657 --> 02:12:01,935
LIAM: Gods! What does all this shit do?

1469
02:12:01,935 --> 02:12:06,697
TALIESIN: Mostly break, quite successfully.

1470
02:12:06,697 --> 02:12:12,591
LIAM: Just like us. I just broke in the temple
that you--

1471
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:16,989
TALIESIN: I assume it was vague and unhelpful?

1472
02:12:16,989 --> 02:12:18,817
LIAM: It was.

1473
02:12:18,817 --> 02:12:19,955
TALIESIN: Excellent!

1474
02:12:19,955 --> 02:12:25,406
LIAM: First, I don't think I ever officially
thanked you for it.

1475
02:12:25,406 --> 02:12:27,179
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

1476
02:12:27,179 --> 02:12:30,656
LIAM: Thank you. How are you feeling, buddy?

1477
02:12:30,656 --> 02:12:36,950
TALIESIN: (sighs) I'm terrified, but other than
that, I think I'm good.

1478
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:48,559
LIAM: I came here for a reason, you're the brain,
you're the one that hangs brain. I don't know what

1479
02:12:48,559 --> 02:13:03,327
to make of my conversation with the higher power.
I asked about Yenk. I asked what we should do, and

1480
02:13:03,327 --> 02:13:06,967
she talked about the sphinxes. She said that
everything that we needed to know we learned on

1481
02:13:06,967 --> 02:13:11,305
the way to the sphinx. I don't know which one? I
don't know if it was the gynosphinx or the

1482
02:13:11,305 --> 02:13:12,699
not-gynosphinx?

1483
02:13:12,699 --> 02:13:19,821
TALIESIN: I would assume it was the sphinx that
was guarding her treasure. Oh! You should take a

1484
02:13:19,821 --> 02:13:28,743
look at this. And I point at the open book with
the picture. Look what we have. <i>That</i> is our friend.

1485
02:13:28,743 --> 02:13:31,275
MARISHA: Oh, is that Yenk?

1486
02:13:31,275 --> 02:13:33,932
LAURA: Well, it's one of Yenk's brethren.

1487
02:13:33,932 --> 02:13:36,419
LIAM: Did you follow me down here? I said I didn't
fucking want to--

1488
02:13:36,419 --> 02:13:39,437
LAURA: Well, obviously Keyleth's there, so I
figured I was, too!

1489
02:13:39,437 --> 02:13:42,382
MARISHA: I thought you were working in the middle
of--

1490
02:13:42,382 --> 02:13:48,223
TALIESIN: My door's open. I'm in my thing, but
it's open, and I've already sent people to send for--

1491
02:13:48,223 --> 02:13:53,324
MARISHA: I said "Hi, Percy." It's not my fault no
one notices I'm around. It's not my fault I'm a

1492
02:13:53,324 --> 02:13:54,631
fucking wallflower.

1493
02:13:54,631 --> 02:13:59,849
LIAM: You scared the shit out of me. This is some
nasty business. This is what we're dealing with?

1494
02:13:59,849 --> 02:14:06,485
TALIESIN: Yes, and if all goes well, which it
never does, that will be fighting the white

1495
02:14:06,485 --> 02:14:15,694
dragon, and possibly the green dragon. And one of
the two of them will kill the other, and then we

1496
02:14:15,694 --> 02:14:18,033
swoop in and clean up what's left.

1497
02:14:18,033 --> 02:14:20,794
LIAM: I don't know if it's smart, but I'm really
curious.

1498
02:14:20,794 --> 02:14:26,873
TALIESIN: I know. I understand; I feel the same
way. It's probably not going to work. It's

1499
02:14:26,873 --> 02:14:28,372
probably going to go terribly.

1500
02:14:28,372 --> 02:14:31,339
LIAM: I think it might.

1501
02:14:31,339 --> 02:14:37,148
TALIESIN: I think it might work. I'm feeling good
about that.

1502
02:14:37,148 --> 02:14:43,146
LAURA: Do we even know how to use the Gate scroll
exactly? Scanlan has to use it, right?

1503
02:14:43,146 --> 02:14:44,971
LIAM: Yeah, the little guy can pull it off.

1504
02:14:44,971 --> 02:14:47,173
MARISHA: It's going to have to be either Scanlan
or me but--

1505
02:14:47,173 --> 02:14:48,368
SAM: Hey, guys!

1506
02:14:48,368 --> 02:14:50,243
MARISHA: Scanlan! Hey!

1507
02:14:50,243 --> 02:14:55,590
SAM: Door was open, thought I'd come in. Grog's
right outside in the hall.

1508
02:14:55,590 --> 02:14:59,510
MARISHA: Hey, Grog! Come on in.

1509
02:14:59,510 --> 02:15:02,865
LIAM: Have you ever been here? Look at all this
fucking esoteric bullshit!

1510
02:15:02,865 --> 02:15:04,286
TRAVIS: Wow.

1511
02:15:04,286 --> 02:15:07,047
SAM: It's crazy! Is that a brain in a jar?

1512
02:15:07,047 --> 02:15:11,492
TALIESIN: No-- yes, that is <i>something</i> in a jar.
It's not a brain, though.

1513
02:15:11,492 --> 02:15:13,210
TRAVIS: What's that a picture of?

1514
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:15,545
LAURA: Oh, that's the goristro.

1515
02:15:15,545 --> 02:15:16,957
TRAVIS: Oh. What are the other ones?

1516
02:15:16,957 --> 02:15:22,066
LAURA: Well, one is called a snake lady. A
marilith.

1517
02:15:22,066 --> 02:15:25,286
TRAVIS: Are they all together, or is it the one
guy?

1518
02:15:25,286 --> 02:15:30,182
LAURA: I think it's just the one guy. Hopefully,
other things can't come through. Can they? Read

1519
02:15:30,182 --> 02:15:31,703
that scroll again, Scanlan.

1520
02:15:31,703 --> 02:15:38,043
SAM: What, my Gate scroll? Yeah, well, I left that
at home today, but I think it calls the thing that

1521
02:15:38,043 --> 02:15:41,987
you call for. You give it a name, it goes, it
grabs it, it brings it in.

1522
02:15:41,987 --> 02:15:44,340
LAURA: It doesn't bring other things through?
Doesn't leave the gate open?

1523
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:49,461
SAM: The gate does stay open for as long as your
conjuration, which is about a minute.

1524
02:15:49,461 --> 02:15:52,026
LAURA: So other things could come through.

1525
02:15:52,026 --> 02:15:53,730
SAM: Yes, that is true--

1526
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:55,895
MARISHA: But you could close the gate once it
passes through.

1527
02:15:55,895 --> 02:16:03,994
SAM: I could drop it, yes. However, this is a
tricky spell for me because I am not-- as much as

1528
02:16:03,994 --> 02:16:10,957
it pains me to say this, I am not good enough to
cast this spell.

1529
02:16:10,957 --> 02:16:13,154
LIAM: You're selling yourself short.

1530
02:16:13,154 --> 02:16:20,291
SAM: I'm really good, but I'm not quite that good,
so I can cast it, but it carries a risk. If luck

1531
02:16:20,291 --> 02:16:25,182
is not on my side, it will not work.

1532
02:16:25,182 --> 02:16:30,544
TRAVIS: Like, it burns when you pee risk, or it's
going to fall off in three months risk?

1533
02:16:30,544 --> 02:16:36,298
SAM: Like it won't work forever. I get one shot.
If I don't do it right, it's gone forever.

1534
02:16:36,298 --> 02:16:37,896
TRAVIS: Are we talking about your penis, still?

1535
02:16:37,896 --> 02:16:40,468
SAM: Yes. My penis will fall off.

1536
02:16:40,468 --> 02:16:41,749
TRAVIS: That is terrible.

1537
02:16:41,749 --> 02:16:43,459
LAURA: We will have Raishan with us.

1538
02:16:43,459 --> 02:16:53,206
SAM: I'm not giving this thing to Raishan. But do
we know anyone who is at a slightly higher skill

1539
02:16:53,206 --> 02:16:54,607
level than me?

1540
02:16:54,607 --> 02:16:56,016
LIAM: Allura or Gilmore.

1541
02:16:56,016 --> 02:16:59,939
MARISHA: Also, Kima wanted to come with us to
fight the white dragon, remember?

1542
02:16:59,939 --> 02:17:01,631
SAM: Is she an arcane caster?

1543
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:06,356
MARISHA: She's not, but if Kima is going, then
maybe Allura will.

1544
02:17:06,356 --> 02:17:12,410
TRAVIS: We can't bring them. We'd have to tell
them that Raishan's with us.

1545
02:17:12,410 --> 02:17:18,591
LAURA: No, we wouldn't. Raishan will be in
disguise.

1546
02:17:18,591 --> 02:17:24,204
LIAM: Raishan has had everyone fooled for a long
time.

1547
02:17:24,204 --> 02:17:27,126
SAM: Do we know where Kima and Allura are?

1548
02:17:27,126 --> 02:17:29,668
MATT: You haven't checked in to see if they're
here or not.

1549
02:17:29,668 --> 02:17:31,603
LAURA: Oh, they could be at the castle?

1550
02:17:31,603 --> 02:17:36,480
MATT: They wouldn't be at the castle. They stay at
one of the houses at the northern end of the city.

1551
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:39,132
TRAVIS: Should I call for a guard?

1552
02:17:39,132 --> 02:17:40,333
TALIESIN: Call for a guard.

1553
02:17:40,333 --> 02:17:41,657
TRAVIS: (loudly) Guard!

1554
02:17:41,657 --> 02:17:44,425
TALIESIN: There's one literally down the hall.

1555
02:17:44,425 --> 02:17:46,006
TRAVIS: Oh. (stage whisper) Guard!

1556
02:17:46,006 --> 02:17:53,795
MATT: Who has now arrived and steps up. "You
called, Grog?"

1557
02:17:53,795 --> 02:17:58,041
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, please don't use my official
title. If you would, could you go see if Lady Kima

1558
02:17:58,041 --> 02:18:00,974
and Lady Allura are around?

1559
02:18:00,974 --> 02:18:03,396
MATT: "Do you wish for me to fetch them?"

1560
02:18:03,396 --> 02:18:05,679
TRAVIS: Yes. Go forth, quickly, with haste.

1561
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:10,251
MATT: He rushes off. You hear the armor and
chainmail clinking in the distance.

1562
02:18:10,251 --> 02:18:11,458
LAURA: What time is it?

1563
02:18:11,458 --> 02:18:17,623
MATT: It's mid-afternoon. You guys have spent the
day doing research and checking things out. You

1564
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:22,150
woke up in the morning and you had your
conversation with Raishan, so it's two, three in

1565
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:23,288
the afternoon.

1566
02:18:23,288 --> 02:18:28,239
MARISHA: I have another question. How far are we,
timeline in the year? How close are we getting to

1567
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:29,807
Winter's Crest?

1568
02:18:29,807 --> 02:18:39,074
MATT: You are close to three months past it, so
you have a ways to go before it's Winter's Crest

1569
02:18:39,074 --> 02:18:40,205
again.

1570
02:18:40,205 --> 02:18:41,805
MARISHA: When's the next solstice?

1571
02:18:41,805 --> 02:18:47,883
MATT: The celestial solstice? You're not sure,
actually. Make a nature check.

1572
02:18:47,883 --> 02:18:51,325
MARISHA: There's not a summer solstice and winter
solstice?

1573
02:18:51,325 --> 02:18:53,186
MATT: There are solstices, yes.

1574
02:18:53,186 --> 02:18:57,134
MARISHA: 24.

1575
02:18:57,134 --> 02:19:07,081
MATT: 24. The next solstice is going to be in
about a month. Roughly 28 days.

1576
02:19:07,081 --> 02:19:09,487
LAURA: Whatever relevance that has.

1577
02:19:09,487 --> 02:19:11,585
TRAVIS: So none at all.

1578
02:19:11,585 --> 02:19:14,312
TALIESIN: No, I see what you're getting at.

1579
02:19:14,312 --> 02:19:25,543
MARISHA: Thordak was busted out on the winter's
solstice, right? Also, the Briarwoods were rushing

1580
02:19:25,543 --> 02:19:29,829
to try and get the ziggurat up and running in time
for the solstice.

1581
02:19:29,829 --> 02:19:32,296
LAURA: Right. Important day, is that?

1582
02:19:32,296 --> 02:19:39,743
MARISHA: Very important day, where nature and
stars tend to align and planes can blur a little bit.

1583
02:19:39,743 --> 02:19:46,788
TRAVIS: Can I ask a quick question? I really like
this plan to use the gate thing and go attack

1584
02:19:46,788 --> 02:19:52,222
Vorugal. I don't even feel like we need Raishan
for it. Shouldn't we lure her away to somewhere

1585
02:19:52,222 --> 02:19:54,030
and then fucking kill her?

1586
02:19:54,030 --> 02:19:56,253
TALIESIN: This <i>is</i> luring her away somewhere.

1587
02:19:56,253 --> 02:19:58,188
MARISHA: The sooner she dies, the happier I'll
be.

1588
02:19:58,188 --> 02:20:00,630
LAURA: We get her over there, and then we kill her
afterward.

1589
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:09,694
TRAVIS: But we'll be weak and she's on the fringe,
because remember, she's barely helping out?

1590
02:20:09,694 --> 02:20:12,717
SAM: What is she going to be doing to help us,
anyway?

1591
02:20:12,717 --> 02:20:14,009
TRAVIS: We haven't decided.

1592
02:20:14,009 --> 02:20:19,833
LAURA: She was going to be another magic user,
dressed as a human, or something.

1593
02:20:19,833 --> 02:20:25,356
TRAVIS: I like tricks, but Ripley got us pretty
good, and I don't feel like walking right into

1594
02:20:25,356 --> 02:20:27,798
another trap one week before another fight.

1595
02:20:27,798 --> 02:20:40,450
LIAM: I think better to get Raishan away from
here, and in that fray, she might not be touched,

1596
02:20:40,450 --> 02:20:43,564
but she might be whittled down a little bit.
That's better than nothing.

1597
02:20:43,564 --> 02:20:45,128
TALIESIN: She'll spend some power.

1598
02:20:45,128 --> 02:20:47,251
LIAM: We have to get her away from Whitestone. We
have to.

1599
02:20:47,251 --> 02:20:52,493
TRAVIS: I guess we couldn't get her anywhere with
a low ceiling, where her dragon form doesn't have

1600
02:20:52,493 --> 02:20:54,011
such an advantage?

1601
02:20:54,011 --> 02:20:55,553
TALIESIN: I think the ceiling would give.

1602
02:20:55,553 --> 02:20:58,595
TRAVIS: No, I mean a cave or something.

1603
02:20:58,595 --> 02:20:59,804
SAM: We could do that.

1604
02:20:59,804 --> 02:21:00,964
TALIESIN: How?

1605
02:21:00,964 --> 02:21:03,276
MARISHA: Vorugal lived in a cave.

1606
02:21:03,276 --> 02:21:08,618
LAURA: Yeah, but a little cave. A cave that Asum
would fit in.

1607
02:21:08,618 --> 02:21:14,665
MATT: That wasn't a cave, it was inside a chasm. A
giant ravine.

1608
02:21:14,665 --> 02:21:21,567
TALIESIN: I think far away on another continent is
a great idea.

1609
02:21:21,567 --> 02:21:23,449
TRAVIS: What about the little cave in Glintshore?

1610
02:21:23,449 --> 02:21:28,630
TALIESIN: I'm happy just to take her. She's going
to follow us already.

1611
02:21:28,630 --> 02:21:37,551
MARISHA: Well, here's my question. I'm sure she's
anticipating us turning on her. What would you do

1612
02:21:37,551 --> 02:21:40,401
if you were a green dragon anticipating people
turning on you?

1613
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:51,956
TALIESIN: It depends. If I needed them, I would
put myself in a position of safety, make myself

1614
02:21:51,956 --> 02:21:56,796
useful, and then make sure I was back somewhere
where they would not attack me as quickly as

1615
02:21:56,796 --> 02:22:00,901
possible. If I didn't need them, I would turn on
them immediately after the fight.

1616
02:22:00,901 --> 02:22:05,577
LIAM: She's going to put out the barest amount of
effort to help us from behind.

1617
02:22:05,577 --> 02:22:14,252
TALIESIN: If we die, her plan foils. If we do not
feel she put in enough effort, her plan also foils.

1618
02:22:14,252 --> 02:22:22,894
TRAVIS: I picture Thordak going, "Raishan, use
your treachery and intellect and go kill Vox Machina."

1619
02:22:22,894 --> 02:22:30,369
TALIESIN: My feeling is use your treachery-- Where
are we? We're in my shop right now? Okay.

1620
02:22:30,369 --> 02:22:37,398
MARISHA: Keep that in mind. We could be getting
spied on. Are we being watched?

1621
02:22:37,398 --> 02:22:43,420
MATT: You have no sense of being watched by any
exterior force.

1622
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:48,693
LIAM: Also, we know we're walking into this shit.
That's no surprise.

1623
02:22:48,693 --> 02:22:55,293
SAM: And our plan doesn't necessarily have to be
kill Vorugal, turn and kill Raishan right there.

1624
02:22:55,293 --> 02:22:58,939
We can keep playing with her for a little while
longer.

1625
02:22:58,939 --> 02:23:01,634
LAURA: She can sense lies.

1626
02:23:01,634 --> 02:23:08,252
TRAVIS: All right, so we buck up. We go through
with it.

1627
02:23:08,252 --> 02:23:13,563
TALIESIN: We go through with it. We made an
agreement. I say we honor it until such point as

1628
02:23:13,563 --> 02:23:15,538
it is deeply inconvenient.

1629
02:23:15,538 --> 02:23:16,856
TRAVIS: I'm down.

1630
02:23:16,856 --> 02:23:19,192
LAURA: Can I go find Zahra?

1631
02:23:19,192 --> 02:23:20,972
MATT: You can, yes.

1632
02:23:20,972 --> 02:23:23,961
TALIESIN: Vax, your boy.

1633
02:23:23,961 --> 02:23:27,640
LIAM: Arguably so, yeah.

1634
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:37,061
TALIESIN: Your boy. I'm thinking of creating a
company of shot for the castle with these guns. Do

1635
02:23:37,061 --> 02:23:45,640
you think that would be a position that would suit
him? Guards that would be forbidden from carrying

1636
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:53,013
these weapons outside the walls of the castle
itself, and would arm the parapets if there was an

1637
02:23:53,013 --> 02:23:55,012
attack from a dragon.

1638
02:23:55,012 --> 02:24:03,558
LIAM: I do. I don't know how good a judge of
character I am, though.

1639
02:24:03,558 --> 02:24:06,617
TALIESIN: Hopefully, a better judge than I am.

1640
02:24:06,617 --> 02:24:23,857
LIAM: You know, I have face-planted more than any
of you, maybe. I have with that boy. I can see it

1641
02:24:23,857 --> 02:24:34,092
in his eyes. We're up to our elbows in blood.
There has to be room for a little bit of

1642
02:24:34,092 --> 02:24:37,339
redemption in this world.

1643
02:24:37,339 --> 02:24:43,763
TALIESIN: I'm a big believer in second chances. At
least, I am now.

1644
02:24:43,763 --> 02:24:47,596
LIAM: It's a good idea.

1645
02:24:47,596 --> 02:24:55,035
TALIESIN: I wanted to check with you. I thought
this was something that I assumed you would have

1646
02:24:55,035 --> 02:24:57,563
some insight into.

1647
02:24:57,563 --> 02:25:02,175
LIAM: Do we have time to teach them how these
things work?

1648
02:25:02,175 --> 02:25:05,977
TALIESIN: He may already know a bit. He spent some
time around them, which is also why I thought it

1649
02:25:05,977 --> 02:25:07,552
might be helpful.

1650
02:25:07,552 --> 02:25:13,111
LIAM: Do you want to talk to him?

1651
02:25:13,111 --> 02:25:22,321
TALIESIN: Well, I figured <i>we</i> would talk to him.
I'm still not 100%. We are going to be fighting

1652
02:25:22,321 --> 02:25:24,635
these dragons, and I am not at my best.

1653
02:25:24,635 --> 02:25:29,882
LIAM: Well, you probably need to get to bed, but
why don't we go find him before it grows too late?

1654
02:25:29,882 --> 02:25:39,396
TALIESIN: I'll continue to work on these. Bring
him down when you find him.

1655
02:25:39,396 --> 02:25:42,206
LIAM: I will. Thank you. I head out.

1656
02:25:42,206 --> 02:25:47,074
MATT: Okay. Percy, can you make three tinkering
checks for me?

1657
02:25:47,074 --> 02:25:48,508
TALIESIN: Tinkering check?

1658
02:25:48,508 --> 02:25:49,533
MATT: Yes.

1659
02:25:49,533 --> 02:25:50,593
SAM: Three.

1660
02:25:50,593 --> 02:26:06,708
TALIESIN: Stop that. Where did all my dice go?
Okay, apparently I have three. Dex, proficiency,

1661
02:26:06,708 --> 02:26:24,550
if I recall? Okay. That's a 29, a 27, and a 13.

1662
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:28,554
MATT: Okay. Rudimentary in their design, but
functional. You manage to clean them all and

1663
02:26:28,554 --> 02:26:34,888
repair the ones that were heavily damaged earlier
and make them functional again without an issue.

1664
02:26:34,888 --> 02:26:38,538
During that time, Keyleth, you were going to
mention something, you said?

1665
02:26:38,538 --> 02:26:40,172
TRAVIS: And Zahra.

1666
02:26:40,172 --> 02:26:45,073
MARISHA: What did you say about Ioun, and why is
Ioun important right now?

1667
02:26:45,073 --> 02:26:56,712
MATT: Ioun is the god of knowledge and spreading
of knowledge and was what the temple that Osysa

1668
02:26:56,712 --> 02:27:02,401
watches beneath the Slayers' Take is based around.
It's also what the ziggurat beneath the city used

1669
02:27:02,401 --> 02:27:07,213
to be: a temple to Ioun, before it was corrupted
by the Briarwoods.

1670
02:27:07,213 --> 02:27:11,509
MARISHA: Scanlan, do you still have those Ioun
stones?

1671
02:27:11,509 --> 02:27:13,602
SAM: I have an Ioun stone.

1672
02:27:13,602 --> 02:27:23,994
MARISHA: Okay. Was Raven's Slumber the name of the
temple?

1673
02:27:23,994 --> 02:27:25,620
LAURA: That's my necklace.

1674
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:32,648
MARISHA: That's your necklace that's got Trinket
in it.

1675
02:27:32,648 --> 02:27:39,290
LAURA: When we're not in the city. He's out of the
necklace. Yes, he's always around.

1676
02:27:39,290 --> 02:27:49,136
MARISHA: What if we go back to that temple?

1677
02:27:49,136 --> 02:27:51,402
SAM: And do what?

1678
02:27:51,402 --> 02:27:54,931
MATT: Vax is gone right now.

1679
02:27:54,931 --> 02:27:56,559
LAURA: I'm also gone.

1680
02:27:56,559 --> 02:27:59,544
TALIESIN: She's been helping me clean.

1681
02:27:59,544 --> 02:28:03,107
MARISHA: Never mind, keep going. I'm just trying
to figure this out.

1682
02:28:03,107 --> 02:28:10,515
MATT: All right. Vex, you go ahead and find Zahra,
who's in the process of still researching in her

1683
02:28:10,515 --> 02:28:20,228
room, her and Allura, while she was focusing on
the ziggurat and the essence of it. So you find

1684
02:28:20,228 --> 02:28:24,130
her and her tomes are spread out, and she's
actually fallen asleep on her desk in her room.

1685
02:28:24,130 --> 02:28:29,943
LAURA: Knock-knock? Zahra?

1686
02:28:29,943 --> 02:28:37,630
MATT: Puts her wand out in your direction.
"Darling, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean that."

1687
02:28:37,630 --> 02:28:40,661
LAURA: How are you? How are things?

1688
02:28:40,661 --> 02:28:48,331
MATT: "Tiring, if anything." She wipes this bit of
drool from the side of her chin. Immediately sits

1689
02:28:48,331 --> 02:28:50,572
upright in her chair.

1690
02:28:50,572 --> 02:28:52,857
LAURA: I never noticed the drool, don't worry.

1691
02:28:52,857 --> 02:29:00,008
MATT: (chuckles) "Good, just trying to figure out
what we can from these siphons."

1692
02:29:00,008 --> 02:29:01,696
LAURA: Anything interesting?

1693
02:29:01,696 --> 02:29:05,743
MATT: "Not yet, though it's been a lot of fun
throwing things into them and watching them go away."

1694
02:29:05,743 --> 02:29:14,936
LAURA: Speaking of, you've been very busy, I know,
with all of your research, but do you remember

1695
02:29:14,936 --> 02:29:17,105
what we spoke of before we left?

1696
02:29:17,105 --> 02:29:18,748
MATT: "Remind me."

1697
02:29:18,748 --> 02:29:20,604
LAURA: Arrows of dragon-slaying?

1698
02:29:20,604 --> 02:29:26,544
MATT: "Oh, yes! I was able to muster one."

1699
02:29:26,544 --> 02:29:29,299
LAURA: Okay, that's wonderful! One is better than
none.

1700
02:29:29,299 --> 02:29:35,001
MATT: "That is all I've been able to get done in
time." She pulls out a small case and opens it. It

1701
02:29:35,001 --> 02:29:42,121
looks a little roughshod, not quite as perfect,
but she says, "The enchantment took."

1702
02:29:42,121 --> 02:29:47,620
LAURA: Wonderful! This is costly, what do I owe
you?

1703
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:54,497
MATT: "Oh, for this?" Let's find out.

1704
02:29:54,497 --> 02:30:01,941
LAURA: I hope this isn't a lot.

1705
02:30:01,941 --> 02:30:05,557
TRAVIS: 5,000 gold.

1706
02:30:05,557 --> 02:30:12,757
MATT: "That would come to roughly-- on the market,
about 30,000 gold pieces."

1707
02:30:12,757 --> 02:30:23,787
LAURA: But she made it, so that's not how much it
would be, right? Zahra said it wasn't that much before.

1708
02:30:23,787 --> 02:30:35,258
MATT: "It's <i>mostly</i> done? I could keep working on
it, if you like, and make it all done."

1709
02:30:35,258 --> 02:30:40,680
LAURA: Oh. Okay. But that's 30,000 gold pieces?

1710
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:44,866
MATT: "Well, for cost and time. I'd put it more
about 12, for a friend."

1711
02:30:44,866 --> 02:30:48,527
LAURA: Jesus. Man.

1712
02:30:48,527 --> 02:30:51,172
TRAVIS: Better make it work, then. Better wait.

1713
02:30:51,172 --> 02:30:53,941
LAURA: I'll wait. You keep making this awesome.

1714
02:30:53,941 --> 02:30:59,372
MATT: "Okay. Sorry dear, I haven't had a lot of
time."

1715
02:30:59,372 --> 02:31:01,812
LAURA: (dryly) No. I know you're so busy.

1716
02:31:01,812 --> 02:31:07,062
LIAM: The romance is over.

1717
02:31:07,062 --> 02:31:09,636
(laughter)

1718
02:31:09,636 --> 02:31:14,604
LAURA: Mark it back down to one in my-- Zahra,
you're amazing.

1719
02:31:14,604 --> 02:31:19,104
LIAM: (dryly) No, it's great. It's super cool.

1720
02:31:19,104 --> 02:31:26,972
LAURA: We're going into battle pretty soon. These
fuckers are pretty dangerous, so I'm concerned.

1721
02:31:26,972 --> 02:31:33,356
MATT: "So should I balk on the research and focus
on--"

1722
02:31:33,356 --> 02:31:37,486
LAURA: Keep doing what you're doing. If you find
the time--

1723
02:31:37,486 --> 02:31:40,561
MATT: "Noted."

1724
02:31:40,561 --> 02:31:42,888
LAURA: Thank you, Zahra.

1725
02:31:42,888 --> 02:31:49,977
MATT: "No worries, dear. I should make some tea."
She rubs her eye a little bit, gets up. "Have a

1726
02:31:49,977 --> 02:31:55,216
"good night, Vex." Walks by. As she exits the room
as you stand there, her tail whips you in the back.

1727
02:31:55,216 --> 02:31:57,359
LAURA: I deserved that!

1728
02:31:57,359 --> 02:32:00,649
LIAM: Mary is going to see this!

1729
02:32:00,649 --> 02:32:02,654
LAURA: Mary said it was only five, okay.

1730
02:32:02,654 --> 02:32:06,923
TALIESIN: Mary says a lot of things.

1731
02:32:06,923 --> 02:32:09,914
TRAVIS: Did Kima and Allura show up yet?

1732
02:32:09,914 --> 02:32:13,411
MATT: Kima shows up.

1733
02:32:13,411 --> 02:32:15,489
TRAVIS: Kima shows up? Kima!

1734
02:32:15,489 --> 02:32:22,476
MATT: As she walks up, it's midday. She's not
armored at all. She's wearing a standard linen

1735
02:32:22,476 --> 02:32:28,135
shirt that's sweat through. It looks like she's
been doing physical labor work and she comes up

1736
02:32:28,135 --> 02:32:32,392
with dirt smeared in her face. "Grog, it's been a
while!"

1737
02:32:32,392 --> 02:32:36,637
TRAVIS: It has! Yeah, you little badass.

1738
02:32:36,637 --> 02:32:43,010
MATT: (chuckles) "You big badass. What can I do
for you?"

1739
02:32:43,010 --> 02:32:46,941
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah. The thinkers are inside the
room.

1740
02:32:46,941 --> 02:32:52,142
SAM: Hey. Where's Allura?

1741
02:32:52,142 --> 02:32:54,443
MATT: "Do you need me to get her, as well?"

1742
02:32:54,443 --> 02:32:57,072
SAM: Yeah, the guard was supposed to get you
both.

1743
02:32:57,072 --> 02:33:02,599
MATT: "Ugh. I'll be right back." She leaves for a
bit. You wait a little bit longer.

1744
02:33:02,599 --> 02:33:13,316
Eventually, she comes back with Allura. Allura not
quite as dirty as Kima. They both arrive. "Hello,

1745
02:33:13,316 --> 02:33:18,412
"I'm glad to see you've returned. Can I help you?"

1746
02:33:18,412 --> 02:33:27,878
SAM: Yes, I don't normally need to ask for help
with magic, but this Gate scroll that I have here,

1747
02:33:27,878 --> 02:33:30,309
is this something that you can do?

1748
02:33:30,309 --> 02:33:33,641
MATT: "This is beyond my magic."

1749
02:33:33,641 --> 02:33:37,003
SAM: Forget I ever showed it to you. Doesn't
exist.

1750
02:33:37,003 --> 02:33:39,139
MATT: "No, this is incredible. This is very
powerful magic."

1751
02:33:39,139 --> 02:33:41,744
SAM: I know it's really cool, but you shouldn't
know about it. It's bad news.

1752
02:33:41,744 --> 02:33:50,289
MATT: "I think it has quite a bit of utility, to
be honest. Do you need this, or could I--"

1753
02:33:50,289 --> 02:33:54,018
SAM: No, I do need it, desperately, yes. It's very
vital to our mission.

1754
02:33:54,018 --> 02:33:55,810
MATT: "Well, all right."

1755
02:33:55,810 --> 02:34:00,043
TRAVIS: Whoa, wait. Do you have a use for it in
mind, in particular?

1756
02:34:00,043 --> 02:34:10,322
MATT: "Well, this is the kind of spell that I
could copy into my spellbook, and once I'm able to

1757
02:34:10,322 --> 02:34:13,292
"utilize it down the road it would be at my
disposal."

1758
02:34:13,292 --> 02:34:16,736
SAM: Would that make this scroll inactive?

1759
02:34:16,736 --> 02:34:22,817
MATT: "It would destroy the scroll, but I would be
able to utilize the spell in a few years, maybe."

1760
02:34:22,817 --> 02:34:28,848
TRAVIS: How long does it take to copy down the
scroll? A couple seconds?

1761
02:34:28,848 --> 02:34:31,267
MATT: "It takes a few hours, maybe."

1762
02:34:31,267 --> 02:34:34,622
TRAVIS: What is this voice I'm hearing?

1763
02:34:34,622 --> 02:34:38,789
LAURA: I just wandered back. I'm done talking to
Zahra. Hey. The door's open.

1764
02:34:38,789 --> 02:34:55,191
MATT: "Be careful with that. From what I can glean
from the enchantment, it offers you quite a chance

1765
02:34:55,191 --> 02:35:00,461
"to pull pretty much anything to your side, but no
real bindings on what you pull through."

1766
02:35:00,461 --> 02:35:14,336
SAM: Yes. I think I understand how it works, but I
don't know if I'll be able to do it when the time comes.

1767
02:35:14,336 --> 02:35:19,463
TRAVIS: No bindings on what comes through? You
might get more than you bargained for?

1768
02:35:19,463 --> 02:35:27,467
MATT: "There are many a mage who ended up trying
to bend something to their will and weren't seen

1769
02:35:27,467 --> 02:35:29,122
"ever again."

1770
02:35:29,122 --> 02:35:36,182
SAM: I think what she's referring to is once we
pull the thing through, it acts of its own

1771
02:35:36,182 --> 02:35:38,495
volition. We can't tell it what to do.

1772
02:35:38,495 --> 02:35:40,669
LAURA: We stay clear.

1773
02:35:40,669 --> 02:35:46,010
TRAVIS: Okay. But will its friends come through?

1774
02:35:46,010 --> 02:35:48,406
SAM: Probably not?

1775
02:35:48,406 --> 02:35:51,153
TRAVIS: Probably is good enough for me.

1776
02:35:51,153 --> 02:35:55,299
SAM: (sighs) All right.

1777
02:35:55,299 --> 02:35:59,833
LAURA: Once we pull it through, how do we keep it
in place long enough for--

1778
02:35:59,833 --> 02:36:03,300
SAM: We don't, we pull it through right in front
of--

1779
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:05,361
LAURA: How do we get in front of--

1780
02:36:05,361 --> 02:36:06,928
SAM: I could be invisible.

1781
02:36:06,928 --> 02:36:11,406
TRAVIS: Allura, thank you so much for your time.
Please don't let us disturb you any longer.

1782
02:36:11,406 --> 02:36:18,249
MATT: "No worries, I'm about to ready continuing
to strengthen the veil with Shaun--"

1783
02:36:18,249 --> 02:36:22,882
SAM: Also I don't know if you'd heard, but Tiberius
fell.

1784
02:36:22,882 --> 02:36:45,904
MATT: "Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. These are
dangerous times. I've got something I've got to

1785
02:36:45,904 --> 02:36:56,845
"do. Stay safe. Be careful with that." She walks
out of the room, a little dazed, and rubs the top

1786
02:36:56,845 --> 02:37:01,221
of Kima's head, and you watch her leave.

1787
02:37:01,221 --> 02:37:03,557
LAURA: How is she?

1788
02:37:03,557 --> 02:37:07,780
MATT: "She's stretched a little thin these days,
to be honest."

1789
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:09,870
LAURA: Her and Gilmore both.

1790
02:37:09,870 --> 02:37:12,691
MATT: "Well there's a lot going on, and a lot
needs to be <i>found</i> and a lot needs to be <i>done</i>,

1791
02:37:12,691 --> 02:37:22,521
"and a never-ending barrage of responsibility.
Which I despise. Where are you guys off to?"

1792
02:37:22,521 --> 02:37:26,600
LAURA: Well, something you might enjoy, actually.

1793
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:35,344
MATT: "Really?" You see this big, toothy grin curl
across her face, and her fingers twitch. "So?"

1794
02:37:35,344 --> 02:37:37,374
LAURA: Feel like killing a dragon?

1795
02:37:37,374 --> 02:37:44,183
MATT: (excited chuckles) "I was hoping you'd say
that! Let me get my armor. How soon? When?"

1796
02:37:44,183 --> 02:37:47,478
TRAVIS: Pretty soon. We only save you for the big
fights.

1797
02:37:47,478 --> 02:37:55,599
MATT: "All righty! Stay right here. I'll be right
back!" She darts off with a spring in her step and

1798
02:37:55,599 --> 02:37:57,546
a little chuckle as she heads down the
hall.

1799
02:37:57,546 --> 02:37:59,105
TRAVIS: Quick, before she comes back.

1800
02:37:59,105 --> 02:38:00,084
LAURA: No!

1801
02:38:00,084 --> 02:38:02,533
TRAVIS: What? It would be the best bag ever, come
on.

1802
02:38:02,533 --> 02:38:04,511
SAM: Won't she ask why Asum is with us?

1803
02:38:04,511 --> 02:38:06,952
LAURA: No.

1804
02:38:06,952 --> 02:38:08,782
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1805
02:38:08,782 --> 02:38:13,387
MARISHA: Here's what I think. She's going to find out
eventually, and then what do we say when they all

1806
02:38:13,424 --> 02:38:15,346
know we've known the whole time?

1807
02:38:15,346 --> 02:38:22,354
TRAVIS: Look, when we start attacking Seeker Asum,
then we kill Kima. What? She's probably a dragon, too.

1808
02:38:22,354 --> 02:38:30,509
LAURA: Shit. I totally did that, didn't I? But she
wanted to come! And fight the dragon. I'm an idiot.

1809
02:38:30,509 --> 02:38:35,340
TRAVIS: Look, we don't have to tell her. As soon
as we hit Raishan, she'll reveal herself, anyway.

1810
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:38,962
That was our agreement, not tell, right?

1811
02:38:38,962 --> 02:38:42,375
MARISHA: But then what happens when Kima goes, did
you guys know?

1812
02:38:42,375 --> 02:38:43,845
TALIESIN: Yes.

1813
02:38:43,845 --> 02:38:45,465
TRAVIS: Yeah. She didn't ask.

1814
02:38:45,465 --> 02:38:49,377
SAM: Paints us as pretty shady folk.

1815
02:38:49,377 --> 02:38:53,865
MARISHA: These are the people we need to trust us.
They are our allies.

1816
02:38:53,865 --> 02:38:57,569
TALIESIN: She has kept secrets from us, and we
have a perfectly legitimate reason for not

1817
02:38:57,569 --> 02:38:58,566
telling.

1818
02:38:58,566 --> 02:38:59,883
TRAVIS: I'm with Percy on that.

1819
02:38:59,883 --> 02:39:00,979
MARISHA: That was also years ago!

1820
02:39:00,979 --> 02:39:05,275
TALIESIN: No, we have a very-- fine! We still have
a perfectly reasonable reason for not telling

1821
02:39:05,275 --> 02:39:08,740
anyone, which is that if we tell people the city
gets destroyed.

1822
02:39:08,740 --> 02:39:10,091
LAURA: And they get destroyed!

1823
02:39:10,091 --> 02:39:14,065
TALIESIN: You are welcome to tell her, and then we
have to deal with the city being destroyed.

1824
02:39:14,065 --> 02:39:18,570
TRAVIS: Plus, Kima is a total bash brother, and if
she gets to find out she gets to kill two dragons

1825
02:39:18,570 --> 02:39:21,202
instead of one, I don't think she's going to be
upset.

1826
02:39:21,202 --> 02:39:24,945
SAM: I don't know, we're putting her in a lot of
danger.

1827
02:39:24,945 --> 02:39:27,213
TALIESIN: As opposed to staying here.

1828
02:39:27,213 --> 02:39:31,657
MARISHA: And we were aware, and we could have told
her. She going to be angry at not telling her the

1829
02:39:31,657 --> 02:39:32,628
full parameters.

1830
02:39:32,628 --> 02:39:33,552
TALIESIN: She will.

1831
02:39:33,552 --> 02:39:36,862
TRAVIS: Yeah, did see her, though? She's sweaty.
She's working on the outside of houses.

1832
02:39:36,862 --> 02:39:38,814
MARISHA: This is not someone we want to lose our
trust.

1833
02:39:38,814 --> 02:39:44,110
SAM: She could help protect the city, it could go
under siege.

1834
02:39:44,110 --> 02:39:47,289
TALIESIN: She's a soldier. They're used to not
being told things.

1835
02:39:47,289 --> 02:39:54,264
MARISHA: No, she is not a soldier in our
manifested army! She is our friend and ally. There

1836
02:39:54,264 --> 02:39:57,171
is a difference right now. This is a different
duty and relationship.

1837
02:39:57,171 --> 02:39:59,639
LAURA: I feel like I got us into this, and I'm
really sorry about that.

1838
02:39:59,639 --> 02:40:02,639
SAM: We can get her out of it really quickly.

1839
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:04,477
TALIESIN: We can tell her not to come.

1840
02:40:04,477 --> 02:40:07,020
SAM: We can tell her that it never happened.

1841
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:14,393
TRAVIS: You saw how excited she was! It's her
choice! If she's our friend and ally, let her choose.

1842
02:40:14,393 --> 02:40:18,750
SAM: She'll choose a fight every time.

1843
02:40:18,750 --> 02:40:19,745
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1844
02:40:19,745 --> 02:40:23,837
MARISHA: But she'll choose a fight unaware of
exactly what she's getting into.

1845
02:40:23,837 --> 02:40:29,248
TALIESIN: Well, we can make that clear, then. Tell
her that there are aspects of this fight that

1846
02:40:29,248 --> 02:40:33,933
sadly must remain secret, that it's far more
dangerous than we could possibly even explain--

1847
02:40:33,933 --> 02:40:35,247
TRAVIS: Yep, what he said.

1848
02:40:35,247 --> 02:40:38,499
TALIESIN: And that things may go completely
tits-up.

1849
02:40:38,499 --> 02:40:43,156
MARISHA: This is Lady Kima we are talking about!
She is one of the most hard-headed people we know.

1850
02:40:43,156 --> 02:40:46,156
She is going to push until we tell her what
happened.

1851
02:40:46,156 --> 02:40:48,349
TALIESIN: Even if we tell her the truth, she's
still going to want to come.

1852
02:40:48,349 --> 02:40:55,168
MARISHA: So then either we tell her the truth and
trust that she can keep a secret, or she doesn't

1853
02:40:55,168 --> 02:40:59,425
come. She's going to find out, and I don't want to
lose her trust.

1854
02:40:59,425 --> 02:41:00,815
TALIESIN: I don't want to tell her.

1855
02:41:00,815 --> 02:41:02,121
MARISHA: Percy--

1856
02:41:02,121 --> 02:41:07,765
TALIESIN: No, I'm happy for her not to come
because I don't want to tell her, because I don't trust--

1857
02:41:07,765 --> 02:41:10,707
MARISHA: I don't trust anyone right now.

1858
02:41:10,707 --> 02:41:14,546
TALIESIN: I barely trust <i>us</i> to keep this secret,
let alone another person.

1859
02:41:14,546 --> 02:41:18,380
TRAVIS: Oh my god, honestly. All right. To a
vote.

1860
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:21,066
LAURA: What are we voting on?

1861
02:41:21,066 --> 02:41:23,911
TRAVIS: Whether we bring Kima or not.

1862
02:41:23,911 --> 02:41:30,059
MARISHA: She's going to be mad at us either way,
so it depends on if she's mad at us now or even

1863
02:41:30,059 --> 02:41:31,753
more angry at us later.

1864
02:41:31,753 --> 02:41:37,755
TRAVIS: I want her to fight a dragon. All those in
favor of Kima <i>not</i> going to fight a dragon, raise

1865
02:41:37,755 --> 02:41:46,206
your hand. All those in favor of Kima <i>going</i> to
fight a dragon, raise your hand.

1866
02:41:46,206 --> 02:41:49,777
LAURA: You're abstaining?

1867
02:41:49,777 --> 02:41:50,975
LIAM: I'm not there.

1868
02:41:50,975 --> 02:41:52,016
LAURA: Oh shit!

1869
02:41:52,016 --> 02:41:54,131
TRAVIS: I grab my earring. I'm like, Vax, where
are you? Can you hear me?

1870
02:41:54,131 --> 02:41:56,680
LIAM: I'm sure I'm more than 500 feet away.

1871
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:57,650
MATT: Yeah.

1872
02:41:57,650 --> 02:42:04,436
MARISHA: Well, look, she's then going to wonder
why we uninvited her. We are lying to her no

1873
02:42:04,436 --> 02:42:06,164
matter which way we take right now.

1874
02:42:06,164 --> 02:42:08,394
SAM: If you want I can wipe her memory of the fact
that we offered--

1875
02:42:08,394 --> 02:42:09,780
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

1876
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:13,862
LAURA: If she finds out, she is going to be really
super pissed.

1877
02:42:13,862 --> 02:42:15,421
TALIESIN: I'm okay with this plan.

1878
02:42:15,421 --> 02:42:18,240
TRAVIS: Removing an ally from a fight.

1879
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:20,592
LAURA: I feel like she should come.

1880
02:42:20,592 --> 02:42:26,175
TRAVIS: Taking one of the guns and going, nah! I
want that gun to trust me.

1881
02:42:26,175 --> 02:42:31,910
MARISHA: Look, I want her there more than
anything. I don't want to lie to her and I also

1882
02:42:31,910 --> 02:42:37,300
don't want her dead and I don't want to drag her
into a situation she could have known more about.

1883
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:42,005
SAM: I defer to the Grand Poobah's will. I will
change my vote to yes.

1884
02:42:42,005 --> 02:42:44,177
TRAVIS: There could be ears listening.

1885
02:42:44,177 --> 02:42:47,346
SAM: I know. Don't worry, I'll wipe their minds,
too. Let's bring her.

1886
02:42:47,346 --> 02:42:48,690
TALIESIN: You really won't.

1887
02:42:48,690 --> 02:42:49,880
LAURA: Let's do it.

1888
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:50,828
MARISHA: So we're bringing her?

1889
02:42:50,828 --> 02:42:54,067
SAM: Yes. And what's our plan? Do we go to sleep
and wake up and go? How do we get there?

1890
02:42:54,067 --> 02:42:57,309
TALIESIN: We go in the morning.

1891
02:42:57,309 --> 02:42:59,573
SAM: How are we getting there?

1892
02:42:59,573 --> 02:43:00,813
LAURA: Tree Stride.

1893
02:43:00,813 --> 02:43:04,778
SAM: We're going to burn her spell in the morning
to get there? Shouldn't we go now, sleep there?

1894
02:43:04,778 --> 02:43:10,371
TALIESIN: No, I was assuming we would go there
tomorrow, set everything up, and then have it

1895
02:43:10,371 --> 02:43:14,398
happen the day after. We can go camp in our house,
deep in--

1896
02:43:14,398 --> 02:43:20,317
SAM: With Raishan? In <i>my</i> house? Raishan's not
getting in the mansion, ever.

1897
02:43:20,317 --> 02:43:27,707
TRAVIS: By the way, that two-week time period we
had. How far into that are we?

1898
02:43:27,707 --> 02:43:29,181
SAM: Two days?

1899
02:43:29,181 --> 02:43:31,355
MATT: Yeah, you got a handful of days left.

1900
02:43:31,355 --> 02:43:32,973
TRAVIS: Okay. Just checking.

1901
02:43:32,973 --> 02:43:39,313
TALIESIN: We go there, we set up. Raishan can
handle herself.

1902
02:43:39,313 --> 02:43:42,394
SAM: Fine, let's go.

1903
02:43:42,394 --> 02:43:45,415
MARISHA: We're going? Well, you know what? I've
got to handle something first.

1904
02:43:45,415 --> 02:43:46,783
SAM: Oh boy.

1905
02:43:46,783 --> 02:43:54,343
MATT: While this is happening: Vax. Eventually,
you find your way to the makeshift training

1906
02:43:54,343 --> 02:44:03,397
barracks that are established on the northeastern
side of the city where Kashaw was earlier training

1907
02:44:03,397 --> 02:44:07,638
recruits. You can see now that this late in the
afternoon, most of the training has come to a

1908
02:44:07,638 --> 02:44:14,607
halt, but Jarett is still in the process right now
of instructing Kynan. Kynan has been given more

1909
02:44:14,607 --> 02:44:25,534
standard Whitestone armor to get rid of the dark,
roguish look that he had before, partially to help

1910
02:44:25,534 --> 02:44:32,882
him mentally feel like he's in a different place
and has some connection to the city. But Jarett is

1911
02:44:32,882 --> 02:44:40,340
in the process now of working him through some
swordplay. As you approach, the two of them stop

1912
02:44:40,340 --> 02:44:47,106
and Jarett looks over towards you. "Ah, Vax, it is
good to see you. What can we do for you?"

1913
02:44:47,106 --> 02:44:49,947
LIAM: Well, first, how's he coming along?

1914
02:44:49,947 --> 02:44:54,919
MATT: "Well he's a bit rough around the edges, but
he's actually a pretty decently trained fighter."

1915
02:44:54,919 --> 02:44:57,907
LIAM: Yeah, I'd agree with that.

1916
02:44:57,907 --> 02:44:59,344
MATT: Kynan's quiet.

1917
02:44:59,344 --> 02:45:07,378
LIAM: I'm on de Rolo business right now. Can I
borrow the boy?

1918
02:45:07,378 --> 02:45:09,443
MATT: "I don't know. Do you want to be borrowed?"

1919
02:45:09,443 --> 02:45:14,887
"I suppose. Did I do anything?"

1920
02:45:14,887 --> 02:45:17,402
LIAM: No, you're fine. Take a walk with me?

1921
02:45:17,402 --> 02:45:18,854
MATT: "Sure."

1922
02:45:18,854 --> 02:45:20,437
LIAM: I need to head back to the castle.

1923
02:45:20,437 --> 02:45:25,450
MATT: "Let me just--" And he hands the blade over
to Jarett, who takes it and sheathes it on the side.

1924
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:28,894
LIAM: Jarett. He'll be back tomorrow for a little
more, all right?

1925
02:45:28,894 --> 02:45:37,599
MAT: "All right. I shall prepare. Don't do
anything stupid, boy." He smiles, and comes up and

1926
02:45:37,599 --> 02:45:42,493
starts walking with you but keeps about a foot and
a half, two feet between the two of you. He seems

1927
02:45:42,493 --> 02:45:45,595
to still be putting a boundary there.

1928
02:45:45,595 --> 02:46:03,767
LIAM: Hey. Listen to me. I wanted to give you a
little more time. I wanted to. And I don't think

1929
02:46:03,767 --> 02:46:14,155
we have it. Things are moving fast. You didn't
know what was going on. I don't fault you; I fault

1930
02:46:14,155 --> 02:46:32,840
myself. That day you showed up-- look at me. I had
a point, but I made sport of you while making it,

1931
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:41,477
and that is on me. And I'm sorry for it.

1932
02:46:41,477 --> 02:47:01,570
MATT: "I'm sorry, too. I should have taken it for
the lesson it was, and I was too dumb and young to

1933
02:47:01,570 --> 02:47:04,979
"let it get through my thick skull."

1934
02:47:04,979 --> 02:47:14,208
LIAM: Hey, man. I'm a little bit older than you,
but I'm a massive fucking shithead. I've made

1935
02:47:14,208 --> 02:47:20,809
plenty of mistakes, and I only knew how easy it
was for shit to blow up in your face, and now it

1936
02:47:20,809 --> 02:47:29,698
has. Percival and I want to offer you a means of
squaring yourself off.

1937
02:47:29,698 --> 02:47:34,809
MATT: "What do you need?"

1938
02:47:34,809 --> 02:47:46,557
LIAM: This city is in danger, and it needs people
watching it, and I know you're training. Percy--

1939
02:47:46,557 --> 02:47:57,271
I'm sorry, Percival-- has a task for you, and I
think it's well suited for you. You were around

1940
02:47:57,271 --> 02:48:04,939
Ripley, you were around her other men, and you
know how to use a sidearm.

1941
02:48:04,939 --> 02:48:13,571
MATT: "I've toyed with it. I wouldn't say I'm a
great shot, by any means."

1942
02:48:13,571 --> 02:48:18,809
LIAM: Sure. But the number of people who know how
to use those things I can count on two hands.

1943
02:48:18,809 --> 02:48:26,379
Here. We have guns now. We need people to use
them, so I want you to come and talk to Percival

1944
02:48:26,379 --> 02:48:32,399
for a bit, and we're going to work out a plan for
you to show some people the ropes.

1945
02:48:32,399 --> 02:48:35,677
MATT: "All right. Okay."

1946
02:48:35,677 --> 02:48:50,368
LIAM: This is your second chance. I don't doubt
you're going to make the best of it. I truly do

1947
02:48:50,368 --> 02:48:56,021
not. And again, I was going to wait on this,
because I can see the pain in your eyes, but there

1948
02:48:56,021 --> 02:49:04,604
isn't time. And I want you to be well equipped, so
I want you to take these. And I hand him two of

1949
02:49:04,604 --> 02:49:11,433
the three daggers that I bought that day, and I
take out the Keen Dagger, which requires

1950
02:49:11,433 --> 02:49:22,712
attunement. These are mine, and now they're yours.
Water under the bridge, and I don't want to hear a

1951
02:49:22,712 --> 02:49:25,245
word, just walk with me to de Rolo.

1952
02:49:25,245 --> 02:49:31,807
MATT: "Okay. Thank you."

1953
02:49:31,807 --> 02:49:35,974
LIAM: I'm sorry.

1954
02:49:35,974 --> 02:49:46,084
MATT: "I'm sorry." He walks along with you,
eventually leading you back to Percy's workshop

1955
02:49:46,084 --> 02:49:52,390
where the instruction is given for the weapons.
Anything beyond that he doesn't understand about

1956
02:49:52,390 --> 02:50:02,417
the rifles. Nothing construction, general
outfitting. He seems to be more of an adept

1957
02:50:02,417 --> 02:50:05,694
student than you expected. He's got some intellect
to him, at the very least, he can pick up the

1958
02:50:05,694 --> 02:50:10,166
details pretty quick. Quick learner, when he puts
his mind to it.

1959
02:50:10,166 --> 02:50:20,699
About this time, as you're having this discussion,
you can hear the bounding of armored feet, and

1960
02:50:20,699 --> 02:50:26,651
bursting through the partially open door you see,
fully armored, eager, hair pulled back in a tight

1961
02:50:26,651 --> 02:50:35,945
braid, big old maul scraping on the stone behind
her. "All right. When are we doing this?"

1962
02:50:35,945 --> 02:50:37,953
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

1963
02:50:37,953 --> 02:50:40,601
MATT: "Tomorrow? That's--"

1964
02:50:40,601 --> 02:50:43,411
(laughter)

1965
02:50:43,411 --> 02:50:47,728
MATT: "Does it <i>have</i> to be tomorrow?"

1966
02:50:47,728 --> 02:50:49,710
SAM: Why, what are you doing tomorrow?

1967
02:50:49,710 --> 02:50:51,789
MATT: "It's really quiet here. I'm getting
extremely bored."

1968
02:50:51,789 --> 02:50:53,190
SAM: Oh. You want to go now?

1969
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:55,952
MATT: "I mean, whenever you need to, I'm just
saying--"

1970
02:50:55,952 --> 02:50:58,508
SAM: We could go now and camp there.

1971
02:50:58,508 --> 02:51:04,459
TALIESIN: That'll give Kik a chance to replenish.

1972
02:51:04,459 --> 02:51:08,008
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

1973
02:51:08,008 --> 02:51:13,451
MARISHA: I don't see any difference in Raishan
being able to kill us in our sleep here or there.

1974
02:51:13,451 --> 02:51:18,003
LIAM: She could stay in the shittiest room in the
mansion, Scanlan.

1975
02:51:18,003 --> 02:51:22,517
SAM: She's not getting in the mansion. She can go
sit in the fucking snow and go to sleep, for all I care.

1976
02:51:22,517 --> 02:51:24,840
MATT: "I'm very confused right now."

1977
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:26,746
SAM: Oh.

1978
02:51:26,746 --> 02:51:27,914
LIAM: Do the thing.

1979
02:51:27,914 --> 02:51:32,314
(laughter)

1980
02:51:32,314 --> 02:51:34,307
LAURA: It's only ten minutes now. It's only ten
fucking minutes.

1981
02:51:34,307 --> 02:51:40,405
SAM: The whole shebang, or just what we said right
now? Just what we just said right now, just that? Great.

1982
02:51:40,405 --> 02:51:44,095
TALIESIN: No, wait! Might as well test the
waters.

1983
02:51:44,095 --> 02:51:47,677
SAM: Okay, yeah. Good. Nine minutes and counting.

1984
02:51:47,677 --> 02:51:51,801
MATT: "Okay, hang on, whoa. I need some
clarification here." The hammer slams down onto

1985
02:51:51,801 --> 02:51:53,148
the stonework.

1986
02:51:53,148 --> 02:51:59,152
TALIESIN: Shut the door, lock it. This is not how
I wanted this to go down, but apparently this is

1987
02:51:59,152 --> 02:52:04,595
how it's happening-- wait a minute. Your boy is
gone by now, right? We sent him out.

1988
02:52:04,595 --> 02:52:06,139
LAURA: He's gone.

1989
02:52:06,139 --> 02:52:10,146
MATT: (laughs) No, you guys were teaching him
about the guns when she came back.

1990
02:52:10,146 --> 02:52:13,339
LIAM: You never know when it's out of character or
in character--

1991
02:52:13,381 --> 02:52:18,085
MATT: Mind you, he seems largely confused and
doesn't seem to know what's going on.

1992
02:52:18,085 --> 02:52:25,006
TALIESIN: I'm going to go take the boy for a
stroll and show him how this is going to work and

1993
02:52:25,006 --> 02:52:30,413
explain to him everything. Gentlemen, you actually
plan how we're going to kill dragons. Excuse me.

1994
02:52:30,413 --> 02:52:34,768
Give me strength.

1995
02:52:34,768 --> 02:52:40,374
LIAM: All right, quickly. Kima, we need to talk to
you about something very important, and if it

1996
02:52:40,374 --> 02:52:42,361
doesn't go well, Scanlan is going to erase your
memory, but--

1997
02:52:42,361 --> 02:52:44,992
MATT: "Excuse me?!"

1998
02:52:44,992 --> 02:52:46,641
SAM: I can do crazy things.

1999
02:52:46,641 --> 02:52:49,139
MATT: "No, nobody's doing that to me!"

2000
02:52:49,139 --> 02:52:57,640
LIAM: Of course not, because you are so cool. Cool
as a cucumber. We're in a bit of a predicament. We

2001
02:52:57,640 --> 02:53:04,879
are going to Draconia so that you can fight not
one but two dragons. Here's the thing: one of the

2002
02:53:04,879 --> 02:53:07,996
dragons is here right now, is coming with us in
disguise--

2003
02:53:07,996 --> 02:53:10,249
MATT: Immediately the maul gets grabbed, she says,
"Here?"

2004
02:53:10,249 --> 02:53:12,543
LAURA: No, I think you're doing it wrong.
Scanlan--

2005
02:53:12,543 --> 02:53:13,774
LIAM: We've got eight more minutes!

2006
02:53:13,774 --> 02:53:15,047
LAURA: No, we don't.

2007
02:53:15,047 --> 02:53:22,569
SAM: Lady Kima. We, in order to kill one dragon,
are entering into a deal with another.

2008
02:53:22,569 --> 02:53:24,465
LIAM: Before we kill it.

2009
02:53:24,465 --> 02:53:26,994
MATT: "Are you crazy?!"

2010
02:53:26,994 --> 02:53:28,592
TRAVIS: I know, that's what I said.

2011
02:53:28,592 --> 02:53:29,980
LAURA: Pure stupidity.

2012
02:53:29,980 --> 02:53:31,267
MATT: "Obviously, yes!"

2013
02:53:31,267 --> 02:53:32,730
TRAVIS: Hear him out.

2014
02:53:32,730 --> 02:53:43,036
SAM: If we do this, it could help us kill the
dragon that killed Tiberius.

2015
02:53:43,036 --> 02:53:45,892
MATT: "And you think you can trust this dragon?"

2016
02:53:45,892 --> 02:53:47,707
ALL: No.

2017
02:53:47,707 --> 02:53:52,697
MATT: "Come on, guys!"

2018
02:53:52,697 --> 02:53:58,464
TRAVIS: All right, look. The dragon is actually
poisoned by a curse. She's very weak.

2019
02:53:58,464 --> 02:54:00,484
MATT: "Great! Perfect!"

2020
02:54:00,484 --> 02:54:02,703
TRAVIS: We plan to take advantage of that.

2021
02:54:02,703 --> 02:54:06,059
MATT: "Why don't we kill the dragon here, and then
kill the other dragon <i>there</i>--"

2022
02:54:06,059 --> 02:54:09,834
LAURA: She'll fuck up Whitestone. It'll give us
away. We have to get away from the city.

2023
02:54:09,834 --> 02:54:18,414
SAM: Lady Kima, you're looking at a group of
idiots who have felled dragons, killed beholders,

2024
02:54:18,414 --> 02:54:25,409
negotiated with sphinxes, gone to other realms and
other planes, and somehow managed to get out of it

2025
02:54:25,409 --> 02:54:27,122
more or less alive.

2026
02:54:27,122 --> 02:54:30,350
MATT: "You are a lucky bunch of sons-of-bitches,
that I'll give to you!"

2027
02:54:30,350 --> 02:54:32,183
LIAM: You know what also this is like?

2028
02:54:32,183 --> 02:54:34,032
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye on the time.

2029
02:54:34,032 --> 02:54:36,155
MATT: She leans on her hammer.

2030
02:54:36,155 --> 02:54:41,992
LIAM: This is what this is like: this is just like
the Underdark, with one exception. We worked with

2031
02:54:41,992 --> 02:54:48,836
that fucking asshole thinking he might have some
redeeming qualities and he didn't, he turned on

2032
02:54:48,836 --> 02:54:49,786
us, right?

2033
02:54:49,786 --> 02:54:53,081
MATT: "Yeah, and who told you that? Who told you
that was going to happen? Who at the very first

2034
02:54:53,081 --> 02:54:56,572
"moment you showed him to me said, 'This guy is
going to try and kill you?'"

2035
02:54:56,572 --> 02:55:00,746
LIAM: But on the side, he helped us get as far as
he did, but then he got shot through the head, but

2036
02:55:00,746 --> 02:55:06,980
that's water under the bridge! <i>This</i> time, we
know that we're dealing with a fucking piece of

2037
02:55:06,980 --> 02:55:14,281
shit. We're going to turn on the piece of shit and
kill her. The whole plan is to get them all to

2038
02:55:14,281 --> 02:55:18,803
turn on each other, and then we mop up the messy
bits afterwards.

2039
02:55:18,803 --> 02:55:20,073
TALIESIN: Seven minutes!

2040
02:55:20,073 --> 02:55:25,145
LIAM: One dragon or two dragons? You want to play?
Let's play.

2041
02:55:25,145 --> 02:55:30,242
SAM: Or you can let us go into this without you.
And probably all die.

2042
02:55:30,242 --> 02:55:32,287
MATT: "Yeah, you're all going to die!"

2043
02:55:32,287 --> 02:55:34,278
TRAVIS: Oh.

2044
02:55:34,278 --> 02:55:36,174
LIAM: You were ready to run with us, girl!

2045
02:55:36,174 --> 02:55:39,041
MATT: "Oh, I'm coming with you, because I'm not
going to let you die!"

2046
02:55:39,041 --> 02:55:40,209
SAM: Oh, you are?

2047
02:55:40,209 --> 02:55:51,212
MATT: "God. Stupid bunch of gits, I swear.
Bahamut, are you serious? (scoffs) This is

2048
02:55:51,212 --> 02:55:56,076
"ridiculous. I'm not going to tell anyone you made
this plan until it's done, because this is

2049
02:55:56,076 --> 02:55:57,961
"<i>stupid</i> as <i>shit</i>."

2050
02:55:57,961 --> 02:56:03,884
SAM: It could be. But with you by our side, it has
a slightly better chance of going correct.

2051
02:56:03,884 --> 02:56:04,942
MATT: "Yes, it does."

2052
02:56:04,942 --> 02:56:06,481
LIAM: Kimmy, can you be cool?

2053
02:56:06,481 --> 02:56:07,761
MATT: "Please don't call me that."

2054
02:56:07,761 --> 02:56:08,983
SAM: Lil' Kim.

2055
02:56:08,983 --> 02:56:11,383
LIAM: Can you be cool?

2056
02:56:11,383 --> 02:56:14,323
MATT: "Where's the dragon?"

2057
02:56:14,323 --> 02:56:17,635
LAURA: It's in Draconia.

2058
02:56:17,635 --> 02:56:20,727
TALIESIN: Six minutes.

2059
02:56:20,727 --> 02:56:22,375
MATT: "What about the one that's here?"

2060
02:56:22,375 --> 02:56:24,289
LAURA: It's hiding.

2061
02:56:24,289 --> 02:56:25,497
MATT: "Hiding?"

2062
02:56:25,497 --> 02:56:28,494
LIAM: It's going to show up after the fact. In
Draconia.

2063
02:56:28,494 --> 02:56:33,014
MATT: "So this whole deal, you just don't trust me
enough to tell me where the dragon's sleeping in

2064
02:56:33,014 --> 02:56:36,095
"our place right now? You're all acting very
weird."

2065
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:37,510
TRAVIS: We made a deal.

2066
02:56:37,510 --> 02:56:42,209
SAM: It's for your own protection. We can't tell
you everything.

2067
02:56:42,209 --> 02:56:46,339
LAURA: What if you go running off? What if you go
try to kill it in here, and Whitestone gets

2068
02:56:46,339 --> 02:56:47,872
destroyed?

2069
02:56:47,872 --> 02:56:49,993
MATT: "Please."

2070
02:56:49,993 --> 02:56:52,928
LAURA: It's a temptation. Believe me, we know.

2071
02:56:52,928 --> 02:56:56,389
MATT: "It is very tempting, trust me, yes it is.
But I'm also not stupid."

2072
02:56:56,389 --> 02:56:58,124
SAM: After all we've been through--

2073
02:56:58,124 --> 02:57:01,816
LIAM: We've all almost died a hundred times.

2074
02:57:01,816 --> 02:57:11,775
SAM: We're asking you to trust us blindly in this
scenario, and I know that it's not ideal, but we

2075
02:57:11,775 --> 02:57:13,726
have saved you before.

2076
02:57:13,726 --> 02:57:20,379
MARISHA: And Kima, please remember: between me and
you, of all people, before we trusted the

2077
02:57:20,379 --> 02:57:23,205
illithid, we trusted you.

2078
02:57:23,205 --> 02:57:24,764
LAURA: Well <i>we</i> trusted her.

2079
02:57:24,764 --> 02:57:27,902
MARISHA: You're right. I didn't trust you.

2080
02:57:27,902 --> 02:57:29,805
MATT: "I was about to say--"

2081
02:57:29,805 --> 02:57:41,147
MARISHA: They trusted you. I didn't. I'm getting
to my point! But we grew past that, and now I

2082
02:57:41,147 --> 02:57:44,954
trust you more implicitly than most people in this
world.

2083
02:57:44,954 --> 02:57:46,206
MATT: "Good."

2084
02:57:46,206 --> 02:57:48,647
TALIESIN: This is precisely why you people need
me!

2085
02:57:48,647 --> 02:57:54,599
LIAM: I think all these words are fucking it up.
She seems down. I think we should just get it on.

2086
02:57:54,599 --> 02:57:59,319
LAURA: Here's the thing, though: you have to
pretend like you don't know. It's super

2087
02:57:59,319 --> 02:58:00,584
important.

2088
02:58:00,584 --> 02:58:02,026
LIAM: Right. Can you be cool?

2089
02:58:02,026 --> 02:58:04,167
MATT: "You're asking me to lie?"

2090
02:58:04,167 --> 02:58:07,726
LAURA: Well. Pretend.

2091
02:58:07,726 --> 02:58:11,362
MATT: "I'm not real good at lying."

2092
02:58:11,362 --> 02:58:14,093
TRAVIS: How about you just don't say anything?

2093
02:58:14,093 --> 02:58:15,292
MATT: "That I can do."

2094
02:58:15,292 --> 02:58:19,765
LAURA: Okay. Perfect. And don't attack.

2095
02:58:19,765 --> 02:58:22,348
TALIESIN: Four minutes.

2096
02:58:22,348 --> 02:58:23,702
SAM: Should I wipe her memory?

2097
02:58:23,702 --> 02:58:24,622
TRAVIS and LAURA: No.

2098
02:58:24,622 --> 02:58:26,332
SAM: Might be easier, at this point.

2099
02:58:26,332 --> 02:58:27,563
TRAVIS: No, we're good.

2100
02:58:27,563 --> 02:58:31,965
MATT: "You come near me with any sort of magic
mumbo-jumbo, I'm going to clock you in the head, Scanlan."

2101
02:58:31,965 --> 02:58:34,983
SAM: Lady Kima, I don't know what you're talking
about.

2102
02:58:34,983 --> 02:58:42,927
MATT: "I love you, but I'm going to clock you in
the head if you try and wipe my memory, little gnome."

2103
02:58:42,927 --> 02:58:47,042
LIAM: Kima. We've got three minutes left. Kima.

2104
02:58:47,042 --> 02:58:48,449
MATT: "Until what?!"

2105
02:58:48,449 --> 02:58:51,453
LAURA: He can choose any ten minutes he wants,
really.

2106
02:58:51,453 --> 02:58:56,295
LIAM: That's true. You know our mind, you know
what our plan is. You're kind of a firebrand, do

2107
02:58:56,295 --> 02:59:01,247
you think it might be better for you not to know--
you know now, but to not know going in and then

2108
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:04,551
you kill everything on sight when we're there?

2109
02:59:04,551 --> 02:59:08,377
MATT: "I have no idea what you're talking about,
and this is really starting to frustrate me. Are

2110
02:59:08,377 --> 02:59:09,580
"we going to kill a dragon?"

2111
02:59:09,580 --> 02:59:10,618
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yes.

2112
02:59:10,618 --> 02:59:11,692
MATT: "We're going to kill two dragons?"

2113
02:59:11,692 --> 02:59:12,864
LIAM: One to two dragons, yes.

2114
02:59:12,864 --> 02:59:14,167
MATT: "Great, okay. What's the plan?"

2115
02:59:14,167 --> 02:59:15,926
TRAVIS: We leave tonight.

2116
02:59:15,926 --> 02:59:16,982
LAURA: We go.

2117
02:59:16,982 --> 02:59:22,398
SAM: We go where the dragon is, we're going to
release bait. When the dragon is done with the

2118
02:59:22,398 --> 02:59:24,160
bait, we go in and kill the dragon.

2119
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:25,331
TRAVIS: Yep, pretty much.

2120
02:59:25,331 --> 02:59:26,539
LIAM: And then another dragon.

2121
02:59:26,539 --> 02:59:28,853
SAM: Maybe a third after that.

2122
02:59:28,853 --> 02:59:35,105
LAURA: If we're totally weak, though, we can't
fight the second dragon right away, we have to

2123
02:59:35,105 --> 02:59:38,271
save up our strength and then fight her after so
we don't die.

2124
02:59:38,271 --> 02:59:48,217
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, I admire your drive
and gusto. Just be smart about this."

2125
02:59:48,217 --> 02:59:52,304
TALIESIN: Look at that, she says she can't lie,
and there she did it so well.

2126
02:59:52,304 --> 02:59:53,491
SAM: I thought you were gone.

2127
02:59:53,491 --> 02:59:57,572
TALIESIN: I'm listening in to this whole thing
through the earphone as I'm talking. That's how I

2128
02:59:57,572 --> 03:00:01,527
keep telling you how long you have, because I'm
laughing <i>so</i> much.

2129
03:00:01,527 --> 03:00:02,872
MATT: "All right. Well, then."

2130
03:00:02,872 --> 03:00:04,619
MARISHA: I'm going to go talk to the Sun Tree.

2131
03:00:04,619 --> 03:00:07,351
SAM: I thought we were going? We're leaving now?

2132
03:00:07,351 --> 03:00:09,132
MARISHA: Just gather your shit. I'll meet you
there.

2133
03:00:09,132 --> 03:00:10,301
SAM: Where?

2134
03:00:10,301 --> 03:00:12,192
TALIESIN and MARISHA: The Sun Tree.

2135
03:00:12,192 --> 03:00:13,550
LIAM: She's our ticket there.

2136
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:16,846
LAURA: Don't talk to anyone, Kima.

2137
03:00:16,846 --> 03:00:19,455
MATT: "If we're leaving soon, I'm sticking with
you guys."

2138
03:00:19,455 --> 03:00:27,078
TALIESIN: I'm going to let Asum in on our plan.

2139
03:00:27,078 --> 03:00:32,361
LIAM: Hey, Scanlan, could you wipe Kynan's memory,
please?

2140
03:00:32,361 --> 03:00:33,576
SAM: Kynan?

2141
03:00:33,576 --> 03:00:34,482
LIAM: Yeah, he's here.

2142
03:00:34,482 --> 03:00:35,851
SAM: Kynan didn't really hear anything.

2143
03:00:35,851 --> 03:00:37,010
TALIESIN: No, I left with him.

2144
03:00:37,010 --> 03:00:38,023
LIAM: You left with him?

2145
03:00:38,023 --> 03:00:39,506
TALIESIN: I haven't been in the room because I
took him away.

2146
03:00:39,506 --> 03:00:40,894
LIAM: I redact that statement. Excellent.

2147
03:00:40,894 --> 03:00:43,673
LAURA: Yeah, that's why Percy left.

2148
03:00:43,673 --> 03:00:45,831
LIAM: I see. I was focused on the fire--

2149
03:00:45,831 --> 03:00:51,184
TALIESIN: Oh, no. I've walked Kynan to show him
how I would like things to function.

2150
03:00:51,184 --> 03:00:55,607
MATT: Yeah, and as you're listening in you gave
him all the instruction and he takes it in pretty

2151
03:00:55,607 --> 03:01:02,959
well. Jarett catches up with you, and you both
coordinate with that. All right. You head to the

2152
03:01:02,959 --> 03:01:05,184
Sun Tree while the rest of you gather the rest of
your materials and supplies.

2153
03:01:05,184 --> 03:01:13,719
LAURA: I'm going to-- well, if we have time. I'm
going to attune my cold-snap armor to me, so I'll

2154
03:01:13,719 --> 03:01:17,431
probably not have my bracers attuned.

2155
03:01:17,431 --> 03:01:23,139
MATT: Okay, so that's two damage off any of your
ranged attacks. So keep note of that.

2156
03:01:23,139 --> 03:01:26,163
LAURA: But I get, what, cold resistance and added
AC, or something?

2157
03:01:26,163 --> 03:01:35,450
TALIESIN: I'm going to attune Animus and drop the
gloves of missile snaring for this fight.

2158
03:01:35,450 --> 03:01:37,813
LIAM: Free wet willies.

2159
03:01:37,813 --> 03:01:48,638
MATT: As you attune the weapon, there's a brief
familiar dark glow on the weapon, and all the

2160
03:01:48,638 --> 03:01:53,327
three names that exist on the barrel all
dissipate. It's now a clean barrel.

2161
03:01:53,327 --> 03:01:59,978
LAURA: Oh no.

2162
03:01:59,978 --> 03:02:10,167
TALIESIN: Well, all right. We'll have to have a
talk about that. Is it all right if I let Asum

2163
03:02:10,167 --> 03:02:12,888
know what our basic plan is?

2164
03:02:12,888 --> 03:02:15,146
SAM: What, that we're leaving now?

2165
03:02:15,146 --> 03:02:21,853
TALIESIN: We're leaving now, we'll be heading
there, the fight will be tomorrow. There will be a

2166
03:02:21,853 --> 03:02:29,441
creature that we will lure and bait the white
dragon with, we will attack at the end. We expect

2167
03:02:29,441 --> 03:02:34,198
to see her participation. If we are not acutely
aware of it, all deals are off.

2168
03:02:34,198 --> 03:02:36,890
LIAM: Sounds good to me.

2169
03:02:36,890 --> 03:02:38,784
TALIESIN: I relay that information.

2170
03:02:38,784 --> 03:02:41,466
MATT: Okay. Do you go to Asum's room?

2171
03:02:41,466 --> 03:02:44,430
TALIESIN: I knock.

2172
03:02:44,430 --> 03:02:46,041
MATT: You knock on the door.

2173
03:02:46,041 --> 03:02:47,204
TALIESIN: Asum?

2174
03:02:47,204 --> 03:02:53,387
MATT: A voice goes, (shushes). You hear lowered
voices from the other side of the door for a

2175
03:02:53,387 --> 03:02:54,843
moment.

2176
03:02:54,843 --> 03:02:59,126
TALIESIN: I walk away, assuming that Asum will
know where to find me.

2177
03:02:59,126 --> 03:03:03,429
TRAVIS: That's it?

2178
03:03:03,429 --> 03:03:10,723
TALIESIN: I go back to gathering my things, pulling
powder and shot out of what was necessary.

2179
03:03:10,723 --> 03:03:17,973
MATT: Okay. About ten minutes go by, and as you're
gathering things Asum approaches. "I'm sorry,

2180
03:03:17,973 --> 03:03:20,297
"Percy. I was indisposed."

2181
03:03:20,297 --> 03:03:25,770
TALIESIN: I apologize. I hope I didn't disrupt
anything important.

2182
03:03:25,770 --> 03:03:35,212
MATT: "No. I was keen enough to cover, but both
the Cinder King and the Frigid Doom are under the

2183
03:03:35,212 --> 03:03:38,300
"impression that there is no mounting danger."

2184
03:03:38,300 --> 03:03:43,679
TALIESIN: Tonight, we go to Draconia.

2185
03:03:43,679 --> 03:03:45,749
MATT: "Very well."

2186
03:03:45,749 --> 03:03:54,685
TALIESIN: Tomorrow, we fight the dragon. We will
bait him with another creature of great strength--

2187
03:03:54,685 --> 03:04:00,864
MATT: "Might I ask what creature of great strength
you intend to bait Vorugal with?"

2188
03:04:00,864 --> 03:04:06,550
TALIESIN: I don't think anything you've ever heard
of before.

2189
03:04:06,550 --> 03:04:08,267
MATT: "Try me."

2190
03:04:08,267 --> 03:04:19,643
TALIESIN: What the hell. I pull out the book and
show him the picture.

2191
03:04:19,643 --> 03:04:21,080
SAM: (whispering) Her.

2192
03:04:21,080 --> 03:04:22,735
TALIESIN: Sorry. Thank you.

2193
03:04:22,735 --> 03:04:24,449
LAURA: Well, it's Asum right now.

2194
03:04:24,449 --> 03:04:25,968
LIAM: It's confusing, man.

2195
03:04:25,968 --> 03:04:27,798
TALIESIN: Yeah. There's a lot of gender issues in
this.

2196
03:04:27,798 --> 03:04:31,748
MATT: "Reaching into the Abyss! That's curious."

2197
03:04:31,748 --> 03:04:39,556
TALIESIN: I figured that quite possibly, in
private, you and I have the closest dispositions.

2198
03:04:39,556 --> 03:04:43,152
MATT: "I can see that kinship, as well."

2199
03:04:43,152 --> 03:04:51,137
TALIESIN: Once that fight has concluded, we mop up
whatever is left. We expect to see your

2200
03:04:51,137 --> 03:04:56,310
participation in some form. I understand if it
can't be direct.

2201
03:04:56,310 --> 03:05:06,608
MATT: "I can be of aid, I just have to remain
inconspicuous. I cannot be seen to be part of this

2202
03:05:06,608 --> 03:05:08,044
"confrontation."

2203
03:05:08,044 --> 03:05:09,356
TALIESIN: Obviously.

2204
03:05:09,356 --> 03:05:12,777
MATT: "And all shall be fine."

2205
03:05:12,777 --> 03:05:20,466
TALIESIN: We may have some extra people with us,
as well.

2206
03:05:20,466 --> 03:05:26,868
MATT: "This was not discussed. Who would you
intend to bring into this deal?"

2207
03:05:26,868 --> 03:05:37,535
TALIESIN: That, sadly, I cannot inform. Although
there will be Draconians. They are disinterested

2208
03:05:37,535 --> 03:05:38,889
in our politics.

2209
03:05:38,889 --> 03:05:40,183
MATT: "And disposable?"

2210
03:05:40,183 --> 03:05:48,142
TALIESIN: I would hope not. But I understand your
point of view. I will say for the sake of this

2211
03:05:48,142 --> 03:05:57,385
encounter, our point of view will be dominant. But
I understand and respect yours. When dealing with

2212
03:05:57,385 --> 03:06:03,732
ants, you must respect the needs of ants. Surely
you understand?

2213
03:06:03,732 --> 03:06:07,812
MATT: "I follow. All right."

2214
03:06:07,812 --> 03:06:13,111
TALIESIN: So there will be that. We will have a
couple of accompanying members as well, but since

2215
03:06:13,111 --> 03:06:18,401
you're staying hidden, it shouldn't be a problem.
I would recommend not showing up in this form, at

2216
03:06:18,401 --> 03:06:19,505
the very least.

2217
03:06:19,505 --> 03:06:28,469
MATT: "Oh, in this form? I have many forms I can
take. I have an idea. Very well. Fetch me when

2218
03:06:28,469 --> 03:06:29,795
"you're ready."

2219
03:06:29,795 --> 03:06:34,613
TALIESIN: We will be leaving on our own. You will
have to meet us there. I'm sure getting to

2220
03:06:34,613 --> 03:06:37,449
Draconia shouldn't be too much of a problem for
you?

2221
03:06:37,449 --> 03:06:41,832
MATT: "Why not travel with you and your band? That
seems like a waste of magic."

2222
03:06:41,832 --> 03:06:51,642
TALIESIN: It does, but sadly we are trying to keep
our own reality quiet. The needs of ants. And

2223
03:06:51,642 --> 03:06:55,550
also, they don't want you around. They don't trust
you.

2224
03:06:55,550 --> 03:07:02,770
MATT: "I understand that, but if you're going now,
it takes me at least three, four days of travel

2225
03:07:02,770 --> 03:07:04,933
"over the ocean to get to Draconia."

2226
03:07:04,933 --> 03:07:15,512
TALIESIN: Surely you can find a faster way. You
got here very quickly. You so rarely lie that I'm

2227
03:07:15,512 --> 03:07:22,808
so fascinated that when you do, I think I'm
starting to get your tells, just a bit of them.

2228
03:07:22,808 --> 03:07:26,888
MATT: "You're a funny little man."

2229
03:07:26,888 --> 03:07:30,289
TALIESIN: I take that as the highest compliment.

2230
03:07:30,289 --> 03:07:34,439
MATT: "Well, then. I'll see you tomorrow."

2231
03:07:34,439 --> 03:07:36,711
TALIESIN: See you tomorrow.

2232
03:07:36,711 --> 03:07:40,764
MATT: And Asum turns around and exits.

2233
03:07:40,764 --> 03:07:48,442
TALIESIN: I turn the corner, get far enough away,
and drop to my knees and breathe deeply for a

2234
03:07:48,442 --> 03:07:50,031
minute.

2235
03:07:50,031 --> 03:07:52,494
MARISHA: Well done.

2236
03:07:52,494 --> 03:08:00,935
TALIESIN: Head to the Sun Tree.

2237
03:08:00,935 --> 03:08:11,172
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the Sun
Tree. While you're walking, Keyleth, you head

2238
03:08:11,172 --> 03:08:12,996
there, as well. Is there anything you wanted to do
before they arrive?

2239
03:08:12,996 --> 03:08:20,102
MARISHA: Yes, I wanted to go underneath in our
little Sun Tree cave that we carved out.

2240
03:08:20,102 --> 03:08:23,686
MATT: Okay. So you go beneath the tavern, into the
basement, down into the little tunnel beneath that

2241
03:08:23,686 --> 03:08:25,148
leads to the Sun Tree's roots.

2242
03:08:25,148 --> 03:08:29,560
MARISHA: Yeah. And I cast Commune with Nature.

2243
03:08:29,560 --> 03:08:30,617
MATT: Okay.

2244
03:08:30,617 --> 03:08:48,303
MARISHA: (laughs) There's so much pressure on
this. Is there a way I can put my hand inside the Sun Tree?

2245
03:08:48,303 --> 03:08:49,617
TALIESIN: Wow.

2246
03:08:49,617 --> 03:08:50,894
LAURA: Yeah.

2247
03:08:50,894 --> 03:08:58,215
MATT: It's less of a merger and more as you touch
and connect to the roots, your consciousness and

2248
03:08:58,215 --> 03:08:59,543
the Sun Tree's consciousness can combine.

2249
03:08:59,543 --> 03:09:00,937
LAURA: You're holding the roots.

2250
03:09:00,937 --> 03:09:16,556
TRAVIS: Dear diary--

2251
03:09:16,556 --> 03:09:18,566
LAURA: Today I talked to the Sun Tree.

2252
03:09:18,566 --> 03:09:20,340
MARISHA: Dear Sun Tree--

2253
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:21,860
SAM: It was so turgid.

2254
03:09:21,860 --> 03:09:23,870
TRAVIS: Turgid?

2255
03:09:23,870 --> 03:09:28,304
TALIESIN: It was an appropriate usage of the word!
Very well done, very good.

2256
03:09:28,304 --> 03:09:29,423
MATT: Yeah!

2257
03:09:29,423 --> 03:09:32,197
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to cast Commune with
Nature and try and connect with the Sun Tree.

2258
03:09:32,197 --> 03:09:37,670
MATT: You grab the roots and feel the warmth flow
through your hands and there your consciousness

2259
03:09:37,670 --> 03:09:41,807
connects with that of the Sun Tree, and you are
both present in that same plant space.

2260
03:09:41,807 --> 03:09:48,235
MARISHA: Sun Tree?

2261
03:09:48,235 --> 03:09:50,817
MATT: "Hey, Keyleth."

2262
03:09:50,817 --> 03:09:56,180
(giggling)

2263
03:09:56,180 --> 03:09:58,644
MATT: "Been a while."

2264
03:09:58,644 --> 03:10:00,838
MARISHA: Hey Sun Tree.

2265
03:10:00,838 --> 03:10:03,667
MATT: "Hey, Keyleth."

2266
03:10:03,667 --> 03:10:08,264
MARISHA: Without burning a question, can I
personally ask you, how are you doing, man?

2267
03:10:08,264 --> 03:10:10,910
MATT: "Doing all right."

2268
03:10:10,910 --> 03:10:12,411
MARISHA: Yeah?

2269
03:10:12,411 --> 03:10:18,939
MATT: "A little cold, but... Whitestone."

2270
03:10:18,939 --> 03:10:28,394
MARISHA: Okay, man, yeah. Hey, Sun Tree?

2271
03:10:28,394 --> 03:10:30,798
MATT: "Yeah, Keyleth?"

2272
03:10:30,798 --> 03:10:44,424
MARISHA: So you're overtop all these arcane
ley-lines across the whole globe, right? I've

2273
03:10:44,424 --> 03:10:53,671
traveled a lot of places here lately. What are all
the cities that the other arcane ley lines fall across?

2274
03:10:53,671 --> 03:10:58,776
MATT: "I don't rightly know."

2275
03:10:58,776 --> 03:11:01,510
MARISHA: Can I sense it through the Sun Tree's
roots?

2276
03:11:01,510 --> 03:11:07,493
MATT: Which, as he converses with you, he says,
"I've been here a long time. Don't really get

2277
03:11:07,493 --> 03:11:18,883
"around much, being a tree." But you do feel this
light, fuzzy, blue, almost like a mist energy,

2278
03:11:18,883 --> 03:11:25,654
like a particle energy that is coalesced around
Whitestone and above it, and it shoots off in six

2279
03:11:25,654 --> 03:11:29,976
different directions, some that curl up
northwards, some that curl out over the ocean, and

2280
03:11:29,976 --> 03:11:38,295
you see them spider out in places and then go
beyond your peripheral. The ley-lines only spider

2281
03:11:38,295 --> 03:11:43,781
out past the Alabaster Sierras; you can't see much
further than that.

2282
03:11:43,781 --> 03:11:53,682
MARISHA: Are there any cities, any places of
interest I can see that we've been through before,

2283
03:11:53,682 --> 03:11:55,398
where they happen to cross?

2284
03:11:55,398 --> 03:11:57,718
MATT: Let me look at the specifics of Commune with
Nature real fast.

2285
03:11:57,718 --> 03:12:05,033
MARISHA: I'm trying to see if I can use the Sun
Tree to extend my vision a little further.

2286
03:12:05,033 --> 03:12:07,498
MATT: Unfortunately, the spell only lasts for
up to three miles.

2287
03:12:07,498 --> 03:12:11,862
MARISHA: Yeah. I want to extend a little further?

2288
03:12:11,862 --> 03:12:17,241
MATT: You sense that yes, these ley energies do
travel much further and surround the world and

2289
03:12:17,241 --> 03:12:22,645
make a network of various magical pathways, but
unfortunately the Sun Tree and your vision right

2290
03:12:22,645 --> 03:12:31,009
now doesn't go far beyond Whitestone. "Yeah. It
isn't a lot."

2291
03:12:31,009 --> 03:12:42,257
MARISHA: So the ziggurat, the spinning orb of
death that happens to be right underneath you, are

2292
03:12:42,257 --> 03:12:44,654
you in touch with what that might be feeding?

2293
03:12:44,654 --> 03:12:46,635
MATT: "Can't say I do."

2294
03:12:46,635 --> 03:12:48,516
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Sun Tree! Goddamn it!

2295
03:12:48,516 --> 03:12:57,638
MATT: "Keyleth, calm down. I'm happy to answer
your questions, invite you to my space. Just

2296
03:12:57,638 --> 03:13:00,661
"because I'm not an all-seeing tree, don't be angry
with me."

2297
03:13:00,661 --> 03:13:02,877
MARISHA: I'm not angry with <i>you,</i> Sun Tree.

2298
03:13:02,877 --> 03:13:06,369
MATT: "Angry in general. Just chill."

2299
03:13:06,369 --> 03:13:09,575
MARISHA: That's really easy for you to say, Sun
Tree.

2300
03:13:09,575 --> 03:13:10,821
MATT: "Yeah, it is."

2301
03:13:10,821 --> 03:13:15,828
(laughter)

2302
03:13:15,828 --> 03:13:20,203
MARISHA: Okay. All right. Sun Tree.

2303
03:13:20,203 --> 03:13:22,020
MATT: "Yeah, Keyleth?"

2304
03:13:22,020 --> 03:13:26,500
MARISHA: You're a tree from Pelor, yes?

2305
03:13:26,500 --> 03:13:28,292
MATT: "More or less."

2306
03:13:28,292 --> 03:13:37,291
MARISHA: Have there been the attention of any
other gods on Whitestone right now? That you can

2307
03:13:37,291 --> 03:13:46,096
sense? Or can I sense? I'm asking the Sun Tree out
of humor, but can I sense it? I'm assuming the

2308
03:13:46,096 --> 03:13:48,250
tree doesn't actually know fucking shit.

2309
03:13:48,250 --> 03:13:55,259
MATT: The tree may know a lot, just, the right
questions need to be asked. The Sun Tree says, "To

2310
03:13:55,259 --> 03:14:03,802
"be perfectly honest, Keyleth, even Pelor's grace
left this place hundreds of years ago. His

2311
03:14:03,802 --> 03:14:10,559
"presence is here in bits and pieces, but when I
was first taking seed, the gods were much more

2312
03:14:10,559 --> 03:14:16,724
"present, much easier to read. Kind of lonely
nowadays."

2313
03:14:16,724 --> 03:14:19,474
MARISHA: That's so sad.

2314
03:14:19,474 --> 03:14:22,435
MATT: "I know, Keyleth. I know."

2315
03:14:22,435 --> 03:14:28,567
MARISHA: You've got me, Sun Tree. I'm here. You
shouldn't be lonely.

2316
03:14:28,567 --> 03:14:32,546
MATT: "When you're around, Keyleth, nobody can be
lonely."

2317
03:14:32,546 --> 03:14:36,222
MARISHA: Aww, that's so-- aww.

2318
03:14:36,222 --> 03:14:39,968
LAURA: He's saying that as you're holding on to
his roots.

2319
03:14:39,968 --> 03:14:42,235
MATT: Don't make it weird, Laura.

2320
03:14:42,235 --> 03:14:43,365
LAURA: Sorry.

2321
03:14:43,365 --> 03:14:45,354
LIAM: It was weird five minutes ago, Matt!

2322
03:14:45,354 --> 03:15:00,263
MARISHA: Okay, Sun Tree. I don't think I have much
time left, but is there anything-- you said you're

2323
03:15:00,263 --> 03:15:09,287
lonely. I just want to say if you ever want to
talk, I'm here. You know you can confide in me. If

2324
03:15:09,287 --> 03:15:12,201
there's anything you want to say, I'm all ears,
you know?

2325
03:15:12,201 --> 03:15:14,083
MATT: "I appreciate that."

2326
03:15:14,083 --> 03:15:15,039
MARISHA: Yeah?

2327
03:15:15,039 --> 03:15:16,571
MATT: "You've got to come to me."

2328
03:15:16,571 --> 03:15:21,944
(laughter)

2329
03:15:21,944 --> 03:15:25,243
MATT: "But when you do, hell yeah."

2330
03:15:25,243 --> 03:15:33,625
MARISHA: You know, I didn't really get any of the
things I was looking for, Sun Tree, but I still

2331
03:15:33,625 --> 03:15:35,437
feel a little better. Thank you.

2332
03:15:35,437 --> 03:15:37,326
MATT: "That's all that matters, Keyleth."

2333
03:15:37,326 --> 03:15:40,048
MARISHA: Yeah! You're cool, Sun Tree.

2334
03:15:40,048 --> 03:15:41,868
MATT: "You're cool too, girl."

2335
03:15:41,868 --> 03:15:43,671
MARISHA: Aww! Not as cool as you.

2336
03:15:43,671 --> 03:15:45,234
MATT: "Probably."

2337
03:15:45,234 --> 03:15:49,136
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, I'm going to be walking
through you here in a minute, so I wanted to let

2338
03:15:49,136 --> 03:15:53,349
you know that there's going to be eight people
going through, so don't feel alarmed.

2339
03:15:53,349 --> 03:15:54,721
MATT: "Oh boy."

2340
03:15:54,721 --> 03:15:56,179
MARISHA: Does that hurt you?

2341
03:15:56,179 --> 03:15:57,630
MATT: "It tingles a little."

2342
03:15:57,630 --> 03:15:58,654
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

2343
03:15:58,654 --> 03:15:59,762
MATT: "That's all right."

2344
03:15:59,762 --> 03:16:02,112
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm not going to stop doing
it, but I'm sorry.

2345
03:16:02,112 --> 03:16:04,686
MATT: "I appreciate it."

2346
03:16:04,686 --> 03:16:07,133
MARISHA: All right. Bye, Sun Tree.

2347
03:16:07,133 --> 03:16:09,099
MATT: "Bye, Keyleth."

2348
03:16:09,099 --> 03:16:11,861
LAURA: Has anybody seen Keyleth?

2349
03:16:11,861 --> 03:16:15,127
MATT: As you go up top, the whole group is
gathered there, currently.

2350
03:16:15,127 --> 03:16:17,433
TALIESIN: She's downstairs with her wood.

2351
03:16:17,433 --> 03:16:20,996
LAURA: Oh. Did you have fun?

2352
03:16:20,996 --> 03:16:25,190
LIAM: You seem way more relaxed than even an hour
ago.

2353
03:16:25,190 --> 03:16:26,733
TALIESIN: You smell of pine.

2354
03:16:26,733 --> 03:16:29,503
LAURA: And sap.

2355
03:16:29,503 --> 03:16:33,697
LIAM: Yep. I'll have whatever she's having.

2356
03:16:33,697 --> 03:16:36,717
SAM: Are we ready to do this?

2357
03:16:36,717 --> 03:16:37,825
LAURA: Yeah.

2358
03:16:37,825 --> 03:16:39,053
MARISHA: Sure.

2359
03:16:39,053 --> 03:16:48,552
SAM: Hey, before we go, Lady Kima. (singing) When
the gnome hits your eye like a big pizza pie,

2360
03:16:48,552 --> 03:16:53,407
you've been mind-melded! (speaking) I'm going to
wipe her mind. It's too risky.

2361
03:16:53,407 --> 03:16:55,222
TALIESIN: Of what?

2362
03:16:55,222 --> 03:16:57,267
SAM: Of the whole conversation. It's too risky.

2363
03:16:57,267 --> 03:16:59,897
TALIESIN: That's a lot of mind--

2364
03:16:59,897 --> 03:17:02,338
SAM: Nope! It's a ten-minute conversation.

2365
03:17:02,338 --> 03:17:04,750
LIAM: Ten minutes, when he wants it.

2366
03:17:04,750 --> 03:17:07,185
MATT: All right, what's your spell DC on this?

2367
03:17:07,185 --> 03:17:08,283
SAM: 21.

2368
03:17:08,283 --> 03:17:11,093
MATT: Well, you didn't have your hand cone out,
though, when you did it.

2369
03:17:11,093 --> 03:17:12,889
SAM: Oh, you're going to bust me on that? 19,
then.

2370
03:17:12,889 --> 03:17:14,970
(laughter)

2371
03:17:14,970 --> 03:17:24,946
MATT: Kima's eyes blink for a second.

2372
03:17:24,946 --> 03:17:29,163
"Didn't I warn you, Scanlan Shorthalt, 
not to try and wipe my mind?!"

2373
03:17:29,163 --> 03:17:30,633
SAM: (yelps)

2374
03:17:30,633 --> 03:17:34,456
MATT: She's taking a hit. Natural 20.

2375
03:17:34,456 --> 03:17:36,470
(gasps)

2376
03:17:36,470 --> 03:17:39,272
MATT: Right there. Okay.

2377
03:17:39,272 --> 03:17:45,553
SAM: (nervous laugh) This is how I die.

2378
03:17:45,553 --> 03:17:48,242
TALIESIN: I'm okay with this.

2379
03:17:48,242 --> 03:17:50,681
MARISHA: I <i>was</i> feeling relaxed.

2380
03:17:50,681 --> 03:18:06,955
MATT: You take 35 points of damage. 27 of it blunt
damage from the actual impact with the hammer; the

2381
03:18:06,955 --> 03:18:12,264
rest of it's thunder damage. As her Holy Thunder
Maul slams into the side of your head and sends

2382
03:18:12,264 --> 03:18:16,304
you skidding ten feet across the ground, coming to
a halt.

2383
03:18:16,304 --> 03:18:17,936
TALIESIN: That felt fair.

2384
03:18:17,936 --> 03:18:19,605
LAURA: Well, he deserved it.

2385
03:18:19,605 --> 03:18:21,230
MATT: "Damn right, he did."

2386
03:18:21,230 --> 03:18:25,503
LIAM: Well, he had good-- there's a lot at
stake--

2387
03:18:25,503 --> 03:18:28,137
TRAVIS: Vax. Let it be.

2388
03:18:28,137 --> 03:18:32,742
LAURA: How about we get through the tree before we
talk anymore?

2389
03:18:32,742 --> 03:18:36,311
MATT: "I love you guys, but--"

2390
03:18:36,311 --> 03:18:37,704
LAURA: Yeah.

2391
03:18:37,704 --> 03:18:39,436
TALIESIN: Oh, no, he had that coming.

2392
03:18:39,436 --> 03:18:40,787
TRAVIS: It was a good swing.

2393
03:18:40,787 --> 03:18:45,879
MATT: "Thank you. I've been tense recently,
anyway."

2394
03:18:45,879 --> 03:18:50,785
LIAM: I pull the gnome up and cast Lay on Hands
and give him ten hit points. You all right,

2395
03:18:50,785 --> 03:18:51,786
buddy?

2396
03:18:51,786 --> 03:18:58,182
SAM: (groaning) You passed the test. You're worthy
of coming with us on the journey.

2397
03:18:58,182 --> 03:19:02,515
TALIESIN: We can only apologize for him so much.

2398
03:19:02,515 --> 03:19:05,755
MATT: "This is true. Shall we get on with it?"

2399
03:19:05,755 --> 03:19:07,475
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

2400
03:19:07,475 --> 03:19:13,160
LAURA: We're popping in far enough away, right? In
the tree grove up above the chasm?

2401
03:19:13,160 --> 03:19:15,148
LIAM: There was that sideways tree?

2402
03:19:15,148 --> 03:19:18,414
MATT: The sideways tree was where you came
through, but you found a tree above that you could

2403
03:19:18,414 --> 03:19:19,395
get to.

2404
03:19:19,395 --> 03:19:22,044
MARISHA: And I grew a tree, right? Didn't I grow
some trees?

2405
03:19:22,044 --> 03:19:23,216
MATT: Yeah.

2406
03:19:23,216 --> 03:19:24,639
MARISHA: I pick one of those trees.

2407
03:19:24,639 --> 03:19:31,887
MATT: Okay. You finish your Transport Via Plants
spell. The portal opens. You all begin darting

2408
03:19:31,887 --> 03:19:34,995
through, Kima darts through. Who's the last one
out?

2409
03:19:34,995 --> 03:19:37,524
TALIESIN: I'll be the last one out.

2410
03:19:37,524 --> 03:19:39,415
MATT: Make a perception check.

2411
03:19:39,415 --> 03:19:48,355
TALIESIN: No. 11.

2412
03:19:48,355 --> 03:19:54,314
MATT: 11. Okay. You dart through the portal before
it closes. You all emerge from the other side. The

2413
03:19:54,314 --> 03:20:00,099
cold, snowy ice hits you. There is actually a bit
of a snowstorm that is blowing through right now

2414
03:20:00,099 --> 03:20:05,663
as you come on the other side. Immediately, the
wind chill hits you, and it gets extremely cold.

2415
03:20:05,663 --> 03:20:14,832
It was darker in the day; it was starting to get
later in the afternoon. Here, it is night. It is

2416
03:20:14,832 --> 03:20:23,122
blustery. Not quite blizzard, but definitely a
heavy snow. Decent wind, night, on the bluff right

2417
03:20:23,122 --> 03:20:30,159
outside the ravine that dips down into the
remnants of Draconia, and the small, icy throne

2418
03:20:30,159 --> 03:20:32,641
that Vorugal currently calls home.

2419
03:20:32,641 --> 03:20:35,493
TALIESIN: Let's find a place to hide the mansion
and sleep.

2420
03:20:35,493 --> 03:20:39,411
MARISHA: What time is it here?

2421
03:20:39,411 --> 03:20:44,020
MATT: It's night. You don't know what hour, but
it's black night.

2422
03:20:44,020 --> 03:20:46,913
MARISHA: I can scry once we get in the mansion.

2423
03:20:46,913 --> 03:20:49,885
LAURA: Can you set us up?

2424
03:20:49,885 --> 03:20:51,933
SAM: Sure, yeah. I'll poof the mansion.

2425
03:20:51,933 --> 03:20:53,245
MATT: Okay.

2426
03:20:53,245 --> 03:20:59,849
LIAM: Also, quickly, I've attuned Whisper, and
I've changed the Deathwalker's Ward to cold.

2427
03:20:59,849 --> 03:21:03,912
LAURA: What's my armor class now that I've put the
cold-snap armor on?

2428
03:21:03,912 --> 03:21:05,349
MATT: You had armor on before, right?

2429
03:21:05,349 --> 03:21:07,417
LAURA: I did, so is it up two points from that?

2430
03:21:07,417 --> 03:21:12,184
MATT: The armor was plus two, right? You have the
item card for it? Then yeah, your armor class

2431
03:21:12,184 --> 03:21:13,536
would be up by two.

2432
03:21:13,536 --> 03:21:25,489
All right, so. You guys enter the mansion. Kima
comes in, looking around. "Well, that's pretty

2433
03:21:25,489 --> 03:21:26,908
"damn swanky!"

2434
03:21:26,908 --> 03:21:29,624
TALIESIN: Yeah. Shut the door.

2435
03:21:29,624 --> 03:21:31,421
MATT: (shushes)

2436
03:21:31,421 --> 03:21:33,271
SAM: I was going to show you to your room--

2437
03:21:33,271 --> 03:21:34,464
MATT: "No."

2438
03:21:34,464 --> 03:21:37,060
SAM: All right, well, then you can sleep in the
fucking living room.

2439
03:21:37,060 --> 03:21:39,748
MATT: "Fine. I've slept in worse."

2440
03:21:39,748 --> 03:21:44,434
SAM: Great. Servants! Don't help her.

2441
03:21:44,434 --> 03:21:54,452
MATT: "I don't need any help." She leans up
against the side of the foyer wall and starts

2442
03:21:54,452 --> 03:21:59,384
taking her armor off. She's keeping an eye on
Scanlan the whole time.

2443
03:21:59,384 --> 03:22:02,157
LAURA: Kima, there's extra rooms upstairs.

2444
03:22:02,157 --> 03:22:03,952
MATT: "I'm good here."

2445
03:22:03,952 --> 03:22:05,990
TRAVIS: Are you hungry at all?

2446
03:22:05,990 --> 03:22:07,990
MATT: "I actually am pretty hungry, yeah."

2447
03:22:07,990 --> 03:22:09,896
TRAVIS: I'll find food for you. I go for the
kitchen.

2448
03:22:09,896 --> 03:22:14,533
MATT: "Thank you." What else do you guys want to
get done in preparation for this?

2449
03:22:14,533 --> 03:22:23,365
LIAM: Do we want to have a Heroes' Feast because
of the terror that dragons inflict upon all those who--

2450
03:22:23,365 --> 03:22:27,285
SAM: Is it prepared?

2451
03:22:27,285 --> 03:22:30,898
LIAM: What else are we saving it for, other than
this?

2452
03:22:30,898 --> 03:22:33,727
SAM: No, I mean, she has to prepare it ahead of
time.

2453
03:22:33,727 --> 03:22:41,220
MARISHA: Can I cast it ahead of time? Sorry. Can I
cast Heroes' Feast at a higher level?

2454
03:22:41,220 --> 03:22:44,242
MATT: You can, yeah. But do you have it prepared?

2455
03:22:44,242 --> 03:22:48,366
MARISHA: No, I brought Transport via Plants. I can
do it in the morning.

2456
03:22:48,366 --> 03:22:52,924
LAURA: But it uses one of your spells? Is that all
right? I mean, it's pretty important.

2457
03:22:52,924 --> 03:22:58,541
MARISHA: It is pretty important. Can I do it as a
ritual spell?

2458
03:22:58,541 --> 03:23:10,330
MATT: I don't think it works that way unless it
says it's a ritual. Sorry. Yeah, Heroes' Feast is

2459
03:23:10,330 --> 03:23:12,734
not a ritual, so you have to have it prepared.

2460
03:23:12,734 --> 03:23:18,155
SAM: You can do it tomorrow morning, or not at
all.

2461
03:23:18,155 --> 03:23:22,940
MARISHA: I'm going to scry.

2462
03:23:22,940 --> 03:23:24,770
MATT: Okay. What are you going to scry?

2463
03:23:24,770 --> 03:23:30,761
MARISHA: I don't want to necessarily scry on
Vorugal, but can I scry in her--

2464
03:23:30,761 --> 03:23:38,280
TALIESIN: She has guards. We also have the leader
of the dragonborn.

2465
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:42,675
MARISHA: What do you mean?

2466
03:23:42,675 --> 03:23:46,262
TALIESIN: We can see where <i>he</i> is right now.

2467
03:23:46,262 --> 03:23:49,396
MARISHA: Instead of spying on Vorugal?

2468
03:23:49,396 --> 03:23:53,086
LAURA: Who? What?

2469
03:23:53,086 --> 03:23:58,938
SAM: Wasn't the leader of the dragonborn a female,
first of all? And wasn't Vorugal a male?

2470
03:23:58,938 --> 03:24:00,651
LAURA: She was. Vorugal's a male.

2471
03:24:00,651 --> 03:24:07,253
MATT: Tooma is the leader of the-- They're not
Draconians. These are the Ravenites. Draconians

2472
03:24:07,253 --> 03:24:12,082
were essentially wiped out. Ravenites currently
hold the ravine.

2473
03:24:12,082 --> 03:24:14,356
LAURA: Scry on Tooma.

2474
03:24:14,356 --> 03:24:15,899
MARISHA: I can scry a few times.

2475
03:24:15,899 --> 03:24:20,047
MATT: Just so you're aware, you can only scry on
someone on the same plane of existence, so you'll

2476
03:24:20,047 --> 03:24:22,721
have to step outside the mansion to scry.

2477
03:24:22,721 --> 03:24:26,957
MARISHA: Oh. I'll step outside the mansion to
scry.

2478
03:24:26,957 --> 03:24:28,086
MATT: Okay.

2479
03:24:28,086 --> 03:24:32,475
MARISHA: I step outside the mansion, and I take a
good, hard look around.

2480
03:24:32,475 --> 03:24:34,893
LAURA: I'll sit in the door, and I'll keep an eye
on this.

2481
03:24:34,893 --> 03:24:36,401
MATT: Okay, both you guys make perception checks.

2482
03:24:36,401 --> 03:24:38,502
SAM: I'm also going out there with them.

2483
03:24:38,502 --> 03:24:40,218
TRAVIS: I'm in the kitchen.

2484
03:24:40,218 --> 03:24:41,415
LAURA: Natural 20.

2485
03:24:41,415 --> 03:24:45,958
MARISHA: Hey! 14.

2486
03:24:45,958 --> 03:24:46,992
SAM: Ten.

2487
03:24:46,992 --> 03:24:49,305
MATT: What's the total on that for you, Vex?

2488
03:24:49,305 --> 03:24:54,557
LAURA: 33.

2489
03:24:54,557 --> 03:25:05,634
MATT: Okay. For what distance that you can see,
there is no light visible down in the ravine. It

2490
03:25:05,634 --> 03:25:11,027
is pitch-black darkness. You can see around you,
there are the trees that you guys came through, a

2491
03:25:11,027 --> 03:25:16,146
couple of other barren, broken trees that have
been long dead or at least leafless for a while,

2492
03:25:16,146 --> 03:25:20,844
slowly curling over the edge of the ravine. The
land has eroded over time and they've slowly begun

2493
03:25:20,844 --> 03:25:28,269
to move with it. You don't see anything else in
the immediate vicinity. It is freezing cold,

2494
03:25:28,269 --> 03:25:31,745
though. You're doing okay because of your armor.
You're a little chilly, and you're shaking

2495
03:25:31,745 --> 03:25:37,724
naturally from the wind chill as you're preparing
the ritual. You begin to focus on the scrying. Who

2496
03:25:37,724 --> 03:25:39,817
are you scrying on, currently?

2497
03:25:39,817 --> 03:25:42,021
MARISHA: First, I'm going to scry on Tooma.

2498
03:25:42,021 --> 03:25:52,836
MATT: All right. As the cold begins to hit, the
tips of your fingers begin to go numb, you finish

2499
03:25:52,836 --> 03:25:59,018
the ritual. Your eyes glaze over white, and your
vision projects itself into the darkness in front

2500
03:25:59,018 --> 03:26:04,764
of you. It rushes down like a sudden drop of a
roller coaster into the bottom of the ravine, and

2501
03:26:04,764 --> 03:26:11,299
is rushed to the side, inside the warm interior of
the wall on the western end of the ravine.

2502
03:26:11,299 --> 03:26:16,955
Darting through a number of familiar tunnels, you
find yourself back to the small village that was

2503
03:26:16,955 --> 03:26:25,499
built by the Ravenites, through the central
circular opening where the small fountain was, and

2504
03:26:25,499 --> 03:26:33,304
you're thrust into the tent where you first met
Tooma. There you see upon the throne is Tooma with

2505
03:26:33,304 --> 03:26:41,624
four guards around, currently draped over and
asleep. Slowly snoring as her head droops.

2506
03:26:41,624 --> 03:26:48,509
MARISHA: What's going on around her? Do people
seem to be preparing for a battle?

2507
03:26:48,509 --> 03:26:56,048
MATT: You can't really tell. You only have focus
on her. You see very fuzzy things. There's not a

2508
03:26:56,048 --> 03:26:58,035
lot of action around that you can tell.

2509
03:26:58,035 --> 03:27:01,523
MARISAH: I'm going to do it again.

2510
03:27:01,523 --> 03:27:08,567
MATT: The scry finishes. Your fingers are now
getting more cold.

2511
03:27:08,567 --> 03:27:10,697
MARISHA: I take the cloak and wrap it around as
much as I can.

2512
03:27:10,697 --> 03:27:13,535
MATT: Putting your flame hands to warm yourself up
a bit.

2513
03:27:13,535 --> 03:27:30,014
MARISHA: Now, I'm going to scry on that outside
entrance to Vorugal's lair.

2514
03:27:30,014 --> 03:27:37,254
MATT: Well, Vorugal's lair is in the open of the
ravine. It's a little ways up.

2515
03:27:37,254 --> 03:27:39,288
LARUA: Yeah, remember, it's that raised ice
platform.

2516
03:27:39,288 --> 03:27:43,430
MATT: Where you guys are up on top, it goes down
into the ravine, and the ravine curls through and

2517
03:27:43,430 --> 03:27:48,149
splits off in different directions. In the center
of where a section of the ravine forks off, in the

2518
03:27:48,149 --> 03:27:52,168
center there is that cluster of ice with all the
spikes off it on top of the rubble of one of the

2519
03:27:52,168 --> 03:27:57,665
central islands of Draconia. That's where Vorugal
is currently living.

2520
03:27:57,665 --> 03:28:04,680
MARISHA: Okay, because we were in there earlier,
so can I scry on the location? Not trying to focus

2521
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:06,183
necessarily on Vorugal?

2522
03:28:06,183 --> 03:28:10,551
TALIESIN: There will be guards at the guard
stations all around the outside.

2523
03:28:10,551 --> 03:28:18,708
MATT: Generally, a particular creature you can
choose from. I can let you scry on the location,

2524
03:28:18,708 --> 03:28:21,796
but I'll have to make you roll for it.

2525
03:28:21,796 --> 03:28:23,619
LAURA: I think that's dangerous.

2526
03:28:23,619 --> 03:28:25,884
MARISHA: Scrying on the dragon, or the location,
or both?

2527
03:28:25,884 --> 03:28:30,420
LAURA: Both. Anything near Vorugal, I feel like
it's dangerous.

2528
03:28:30,420 --> 03:28:33,289
MARISHA: Not knowing could be more dangerous.

2529
03:28:33,289 --> 03:28:40,551
LAURA: Plus, Thordak has those scrying balls
within the location.

2530
03:28:40,551 --> 03:28:58,293
MARISHA: Did Vorugal have any other allies? Do you
remember some of the guards?

2531
03:28:58,293 --> 03:29:03,904
TALIESIN: Just the guards, and it's not really
allies at all. Everybody will turn the moment it looks--

2532
03:29:03,904 --> 03:29:09,153
MARISHA: All right. I abandon the campaign and go
back inside.

2533
03:29:09,153 --> 03:29:16,125
MATT: Okay. Anything else you guys wish to do to
prepare for the evening, before the morning comes?

2534
03:29:16,125 --> 03:29:19,640
SAM: Oh, I'm going to try to load the gun.

2535
03:29:19,640 --> 03:29:28,285
MATT: Okay. Make a dexterity check. Add your
dexterity modifier to a d20 roll.

2536
03:29:28,285 --> 03:29:31,574
SAM: 16.

2537
03:29:31,574 --> 03:29:37,357
MATT: 16. You take a moment and take one of the
pistols. The little barrel clicks out, and you go,

2538
03:29:37,357 --> 03:29:38,461
"Oh!" You take--

2539
03:29:38,461 --> 03:29:41,074
TALIESIN: That's your dex save, not your dex
modifier.

2540
03:29:41,074 --> 03:29:42,937
SAM: Oh! Thank you. 11.

2541
03:29:42,937 --> 03:29:54,865
MATT: 11? You've seen Percy load a bunch, so you
go and take this small bit of powder, put it in,

2542
03:29:54,865 --> 03:30:00,153
put the bullet inside. It slides in, and it seems
fine.

2543
03:30:00,153 --> 03:30:04,434
SAM: Okay. That's it. Holstered.

2544
03:30:04,434 --> 03:30:08,396
MATT: All right. Anything else, guys?

2545
03:30:08,396 --> 03:30:12,667
TALIESIN: I have to sleep it off. I feel terrible,
so I'm just going to sleep.

2546
03:30:12,667 --> 03:30:18,632
MARISHA: Where exactly are we going to-- Do we
have a plan on dropping this beast?

2547
03:30:18,632 --> 03:30:25,794
TALIESIN: We're going to tell Tooma to tell the
dragon that they've found something to kill, and

2548
03:30:25,794 --> 03:30:29,797
take him out into the wastelands where we're going
to release it.

2549
03:30:29,797 --> 03:30:31,616
MARISHA: Should we go try and talk to Tooma now?

2550
03:30:31,616 --> 03:30:35,795
TALIESIN: We could send, I would say, Vax--

2551
03:30:35,795 --> 03:30:39,267
LAURA: I think Scanlan, Polymorphed, something
very teeny.

2552
03:30:39,267 --> 03:30:43,563
SAM: What's going on? Are we going to go talk to
Tooma?

2553
03:30:43,563 --> 03:30:46,266
LAURA: And let her know the plan of releasing--

2554
03:30:46,266 --> 03:30:52,124
TRAVIS: If you leave the safety of the mansion,
you have the chance of being ambushed at any time

2555
03:30:52,124 --> 03:30:53,911
by a fucking dragon.

2556
03:30:53,911 --> 03:30:55,863
SAM: Can we all go as a group tomorrow? No?

2557
03:30:55,863 --> 03:30:59,136
LAURA: No, we can't wander on down into Vorugal's
territory.

2558
03:30:59,136 --> 03:31:00,781
SAM: How far are we from Tooma?

2559
03:31:00,781 --> 03:31:01,972
TALIESIN: Very close.

2560
03:31:01,972 --> 03:31:06,093
LAURA: That's why I said, if you Polymorph into a
teeny, flying bug--

2561
03:31:06,093 --> 03:31:07,542
MARISHA: Fly there. I can Polymorph you.

2562
03:31:07,542 --> 03:31:13,885
LIAM: You can be invisible, as well, and I'm very
sneaky.

2563
03:31:13,885 --> 03:31:15,641
SAM: You could fly.

2564
03:31:15,641 --> 03:31:20,534
LAURA: Dragons see a lot. A lot.

2565
03:31:20,534 --> 03:31:25,689
LIAM: Well, the dragon would know if I was really
a mouse or not, though, as well.

2566
03:31:25,689 --> 03:31:30,750
SAM: We're not going near the dragon. We're going
to see Tooma.

2567
03:31:30,750 --> 03:31:32,886
LAURA: Pretty close to the dragon.

2568
03:31:32,886 --> 03:31:34,965
MARISHA: Yeah, in the same area.

2569
03:31:34,965 --> 03:31:45,529
MATT: Maybe a half- to quarter-mile away from the
entrance to Tooma's area.

2570
03:31:45,529 --> 03:31:47,173
LIAM: Got that Dust of Tracelessness?

2571
03:31:47,173 --> 03:31:54,883
SAM: We could fly in as little birds or something.
Stay low in the ravines, out of sight.

2572
03:31:54,883 --> 03:32:00,299
LIAM: I don't know how to un-Polymorph myself. One
of us has to talk, and you'll do the talking, yeah?

2573
03:32:00,299 --> 03:32:05,724
MARISHA: I can drop Polymorph as long as you guys
keep me in contact with the earpieces.

2574
03:32:05,724 --> 03:32:07,212
SAM: We'll be out of range.

2575
03:32:07,212 --> 03:32:12,614
MARISHA: Then I don't know.

2576
03:32:12,614 --> 03:32:17,904
LIAM: Hit us with the Dust of Tracelessness. You
turn invisible. We'll hoof it.

2577
03:32:17,904 --> 03:32:19,944
SAM: Sure.

2578
03:32:19,944 --> 03:32:21,604
LIAM: Yeah.

2579
03:32:21,604 --> 03:32:22,811
TRAVIS: All of us?

2580
03:32:22,811 --> 03:32:26,374
TALIESIN: No, just them. If they run into a
problem--

2581
03:32:26,374 --> 03:32:29,280
LIAM: We're shit out of luck.

2582
03:32:29,280 --> 03:32:33,243
MARISHA: Are the earpieces going to stay in
range?

2583
03:32:33,243 --> 03:32:36,673
LIAM: Not in a quarter-mile.

2584
03:32:36,673 --> 03:32:39,573
LAURA: Be safe. This is dangerous.

2585
03:32:39,573 --> 03:32:42,243
SAM: All right.

2586
03:32:42,243 --> 03:32:51,120
MATT: They don't work from within the mansion to
outside the mansion. It's a different plane of

2587
03:32:51,120 --> 03:32:52,461
existence, technically.

2588
03:32:52,461 --> 03:33:03,373
MARISHA: Then I'm going to go Minxie form, my
white snow-tiger, and I will stay within earshot

2589
03:33:03,373 --> 03:33:06,131
range so that way if anything goes bad, I can
alert the rest of the group.

2590
03:33:06,131 --> 03:33:10,059
LAURA: How are you going to stay in earshot?

2591
03:33:10,059 --> 03:33:11,971
MARISHA: Earpieces.

2592
03:33:11,971 --> 03:33:14,298
LAURA: Just from the top of the cavern?

2593
03:33:14,298 --> 03:33:17,180
MARISHA: I'll follow as close as I can.

2594
03:33:17,180 --> 03:33:18,642
LIAM: With Dust of Tracelessness.

2595
03:33:18,642 --> 03:33:20,620
TALIESIN: Should be fine.

2596
03:33:20,620 --> 03:33:23,366
LIAM: Hit us, Grog.

2597
03:33:23,366 --> 03:33:26,684
MARISHA: Let's go without having some sort of--

2598
03:33:26,684 --> 03:33:30,591
TRAVIS: You know, the Dust of Tracelessness you
sprinkle behind you.

2599
03:33:30,591 --> 03:33:33,166
MATT: Yeah, it gets rid of tracks. Makes you
harder to track.

2600
03:33:33,166 --> 03:33:36,344
LAURA: I can cast Past Without a Trace on you.

2601
03:33:36,344 --> 03:33:40,944
SAM: I can make us both invisible, so we'll be
plenty stealthy.

2602
03:33:40,944 --> 03:33:45,014
TRAVIS: And real quick, we've got to tell Tooma
that we're coming? You don't think if we start

2603
03:33:45,014 --> 03:33:47,665
attacking her dragon, she'll be like, "Oh! It's
those fucks from two weeks ago!"

2604
03:33:47,665 --> 03:33:49,188
TALIESIN: We're not attacking the dragon.

2605
03:33:49,188 --> 03:33:52,993
LAURA: That's true. If we bust out the thing and
then--

2606
03:33:52,993 --> 03:33:58,668
SAM: No, but they need their people all ready to
attack.

2607
03:33:58,668 --> 03:34:05,280
LIAM: We want them to know to stay clear, to not
attack this thing if they can help it.

2608
03:34:05,280 --> 03:34:09,680
SAM: Also, they might be able to tell us where we
should release the beast.

2609
03:34:09,680 --> 03:34:14,251
MARISHA: Yeah, they would know. They've been
tracking down animals for it to hunt for a while.

2610
03:34:14,251 --> 03:34:15,737
LIAM: It's a worthwhile risk.

2611
03:34:15,737 --> 03:34:18,920
MARISHA: They have to tell him where to find it.

2612
03:34:18,920 --> 03:34:22,962
MATT: You're going there right now?

2613
03:34:22,962 --> 03:34:26,006
LIAM: Yeah, gather up. You, Scanlan, here.

2614
03:34:26,006 --> 03:34:31,369
LAURA: I don't know if Pass Without a Trace works
if I'm not near you.

2615
03:34:31,369 --> 03:34:35,109
MARISHA: I think you have to cast it on yourself.

2616
03:34:35,109 --> 03:34:42,032
SAM: We'll be invisible. It'll be fine. We're the
best in the business. We walked around here

2617
03:34:42,032 --> 03:34:47,250
completely without any stealth protection last
time. We did fine, and we didn't even know

2618
03:34:47,250 --> 03:34:49,265
anything about the culture or the people.

2619
03:34:49,265 --> 03:34:51,510
LAURA: Yeah, but there was no dragon last time.

2620
03:34:51,510 --> 03:34:58,380
MARISHA: I can enhance one of y'all's abilities so
you have advantage on rolls for a stat. I can do

2621
03:34:58,380 --> 03:34:59,811
that to one of you.

2622
03:34:59,811 --> 03:35:02,169
SAM: Maybe you should enhance my stealth ability.

2623
03:35:02,169 --> 03:35:06,189
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. I'm going to
cast Enhance Ability, and that's a dex ability,

2624
03:35:06,189 --> 03:35:13,256
the Cat's Grace or whatever it was? Cat's Grace on
Scanlan. I'm going to turn into Minxie.

2625
03:35:13,256 --> 03:35:19,684
LIAM: Can I do the same? Does that stuff stack, or
no? I could cast Bless, do the same thing, help

2626
03:35:19,684 --> 03:35:20,784
with saves and--

2627
03:35:20,784 --> 03:35:21,692
MATT: Yeah.

2628
03:35:21,692 --> 03:35:23,059
LIAM: All right, I Bless the three of us.

2629
03:35:23,059 --> 03:35:29,387
SAM: Oh, thanks. I will give us both Invisibility,
level three Invisibility.

2630
03:35:29,387 --> 03:35:36,696
MATT: Okay. Both of you go invisible. You turn
Minxie. What are you doing?

2631
03:35:36,696 --> 03:35:40,310
MARISHA: I'm going to stealth as far behind them
as I can.

2632
03:35:40,310 --> 03:35:43,156
MATT: You guys are all stealthing along the top of
the ravine?

2633
03:35:43,156 --> 03:35:47,270
SAM: Yeah. The top of the ravine? In the ravine,
right?

2634
03:35:47,270 --> 03:35:49,135
MATT: How are you getting down?

2635
03:35:49,135 --> 03:35:50,994
SAM: Oh. Oh, it's steep?

2636
03:35:50,994 --> 03:35:55,098
MATT: It's a cliff. It's the Grand Canyon.

2637
03:35:55,098 --> 03:36:01,144
LIAM: I shoot out the wings, and I glide Scanlan
and I invisibly down to the bottom.

2638
03:36:01,144 --> 03:36:08,975
MATT: Okay. You guys disappear down into the
ravine. You lose eye contact with them once

2639
03:36:08,975 --> 03:36:10,656
they're outside of 120 feet of you.

2640
03:36:10,656 --> 03:36:15,956
MARISHA: I'll stalk the top of the ravine and keep
an ear open.

2641
03:36:15,956 --> 03:36:17,002
MATT: Okay.

2642
03:36:17,002 --> 03:36:22,202
MARISHA: And keep an eye out for anything that
looks horrifying and bad.

2643
03:36:22,202 --> 03:36:24,018
MATT: Okay. Make a--

2644
03:36:24,018 --> 03:36:26,932
SAM: Horrifying check.

2645
03:36:26,932 --> 03:36:28,862
MATT: Make a perception check.

2646
03:36:28,862 --> 03:36:31,532
SAM: Who, us? Her? Everyone?

2647
03:36:31,532 --> 03:36:32,775
MATT: Either of you.

2648
03:36:32,775 --> 03:36:34,054
SAM: 16.

2649
03:36:34,054 --> 03:36:38,541
LIAM: Perception, you said? 22.

2650
03:36:38,541 --> 03:36:48,233
MATT: 22. All right. You glide down, and it takes
you a moment, but you do, over the next 30 minutes

2651
03:36:48,233 --> 03:36:55,299
or so it takes you to finally find the area that's
familiar to you in this dark, that is where you

2652
03:36:55,299 --> 03:37:00,640
guys previously were. You're having to look around
for quite a bit, and it's a lot of having to go

2653
03:37:00,640 --> 03:37:07,687
back up again and glide around. It's a big space,
and in the dark, in the middle of the night, it's

2654
03:37:07,687 --> 03:37:12,536
very difficult for you to figure out any sign of
where you previously tread. You do manage to find

2655
03:37:12,536 --> 03:37:15,098
it, but you're now looking at-- how long does
Invisibility last?

2656
03:37:15,098 --> 03:37:16,377
SAM: One hour.

2657
03:37:16,377 --> 03:37:19,386
MATT: Okay, so you guys are about halfway through
Invisibility's functionality.

2658
03:37:19,386 --> 03:37:21,022
LIAM: And halfway through flying.

2659
03:37:21,022 --> 03:37:27,870
MATT: Marisha, make a survival wilderness check.

2660
03:37:27,870 --> 03:37:31,437
LAURA: I want to sit on the door.

2661
03:37:31,437 --> 03:37:34,250
MATT: A stoop?

2662
03:37:34,250 --> 03:37:40,840
MARISHA: What do I use? Just nature?

2663
03:37:40,840 --> 03:37:42,535
MATT: This is wisdom survival.

2664
03:37:42,535 --> 03:37:43,567
MARISHA: 15.

2665
03:37:43,567 --> 03:37:51,781
MATT: Okay. Best you can, you begin to follow the
edge of the ravine and try and do your best,

2666
03:37:51,781 --> 03:37:58,927
remembering the path of the ravine based on where
you were previously and taking in what sort of

2667
03:37:58,927 --> 03:38:05,440
outcroppings and structures were familiar to you.
You think you may have found, over time, something

2668
03:38:05,440 --> 03:38:09,043
near the entrance. You're not sure. Best you can
do right now.

2669
03:38:09,043 --> 03:38:16,174
You guys eventually find the entrance where you
were led in by the rest of the Ravenites. You zip

2670
03:38:16,174 --> 03:38:26,053
through, and it begins to open up into the
subterranean town, if you will. It is very quiet.

2671
03:38:26,053 --> 03:38:38,088
There are a few walking, appear to be
sentries, haphazardly armed and armored. But it

2672
03:38:38,088 --> 03:38:41,509
seems like the majority of those here are
sleeping.

2673
03:38:41,509 --> 03:38:47,402
LIAM: Whatever we do, we don't want to scare the
shit out of everybody and get attacked.

2674
03:38:47,402 --> 03:38:52,234
SAM: No. Should we become visible, or wait until
we get right up next to Tooma and then become

2675
03:38:52,234 --> 03:38:53,244
visible?

2676
03:38:53,244 --> 03:38:55,202
LIAM: I think we go visible now.

2677
03:38:55,202 --> 03:39:03,755
SAM: All right. Okay, yes, let's do it. I'll drop
Invisibility.

2678
03:39:03,755 --> 03:39:09,996
MATT: Both of you guys appear. Do you begin to
walk toward the central--

2679
03:39:09,996 --> 03:39:12,567
SAM: Yeah, so is anyone awake?

2680
03:39:12,567 --> 03:39:15,262
LIAM: No, we just hear quiet underground.

2681
03:39:15,262 --> 03:39:20,764
MATT: It's a quiet, underground tunnel with a
bunch of huts and tents and small abodes that are

2682
03:39:20,764 --> 03:39:25,819
all silent. There are two wandering sentries that
are armored. As soon as you begin walking through,

2683
03:39:25,819 --> 03:39:27,714
they both turn and look, and see you.

2684
03:39:27,714 --> 03:39:29,586
SAM: Hi. Hello.

2685
03:39:29,586 --> 03:39:31,007
MATT: Spears out.

2686
03:39:31,007 --> 03:39:36,717
SAM: It's fine. Yes, we're friends of Tooma. We've
come to parlay.

2687
03:39:36,717 --> 03:39:38,344
MATT: "Put your weapons down."

2688
03:39:38,344 --> 03:39:41,251
SAM: I have no weapons. I play fiddles.

2689
03:39:41,251 --> 03:39:44,339
MATT: "I see a sword at your side."

2690
03:39:44,339 --> 03:39:46,421
SAM: Would you like me to drop it to the floor?

2691
03:39:46,421 --> 03:39:47,455
MATT: "Yes."

2692
03:39:47,455 --> 03:39:52,055
SAM: All right. Well, I'm already being asked to
take off my belt.

2693
03:39:52,055 --> 03:39:56,304
MATT: "You, too."

2694
03:39:56,304 --> 03:39:57,756
LIAM: All right.

2695
03:39:57,756 --> 03:40:04,838
SAM: We're friends of Tooma. We have an important
mission.

2696
03:40:04,838 --> 03:40:06,939
MATT: Persuasion check.

2697
03:40:06,939 --> 03:40:11,186
SAM: 22.

2698
03:40:11,186 --> 03:40:20,791
MATT: (Draconic words) The other guard walks off.
There's an awkward three-minute beat where he's

2699
03:40:20,791 --> 03:40:27,265
staring at both of you intently, with the spear
out. Eventually the other guard comes back and

2700
03:40:27,265 --> 03:40:32,575
talks back to him in a language you don't
understand. (Draconic words)

2701
03:40:32,575 --> 03:40:34,006
SAM: Oh yeah, we don't speak this.

2702
03:40:34,006 --> 03:40:35,982
LAURA: I should've gone. I really should've gone.

2703
03:40:35,982 --> 03:40:46,269
MATT: "It is a strange hour to drop by, but Tooma
will see you. Leave your weapons where they lay."

2704
03:40:46,269 --> 03:40:51,903
LIAM: You're going to take good care of them?
You're going to leave them there?

2705
03:40:51,903 --> 03:40:53,803
MATT: "They will stay where they lay."

2706
03:40:53,803 --> 03:40:55,353
LIAM: All right.

2707
03:40:55,353 --> 03:41:06,299
MATT: "Come with us." Both of them stand behind
you guys, spears to your back, and nudge you to

2708
03:41:06,299 --> 03:41:12,157
continue forward. You make your way to Tooma's
tent. The four guards inside are there, with their

2709
03:41:12,157 --> 03:41:16,660
spears at the ready. Two of them have shields and
they're-- not an aggressive stance, but definitely

2710
03:41:16,660 --> 03:41:22,275
alert and making sure that you're aware, by their
physicality, that they're paying attention to you

2711
03:41:22,275 --> 03:41:25,403
and are ready to deal with anything you bring.

2712
03:41:25,403 --> 03:41:33,942
Across the way, there's a small fire in the center
of the room, a small fire pit that is largely

2713
03:41:33,942 --> 03:41:40,655
burned out now to small embers. The smell of
smoke and sage is very prominent and strong in the

2714
03:41:40,655 --> 03:41:50,156
room. Tooma, you can see, is now cupping a small
goblet made of simple wood. You see steam rising

2715
03:41:50,156 --> 03:41:52,010
off of it, and she's sipping.

2716
03:41:52,010 --> 03:41:54,274
LIAM: I'll leave this up to you, Mr. Reynolds.

2717
03:41:54,274 --> 03:41:58,179
SAM: Lady Tooma, sorry to wake you out of your
slumber.

2718
03:41:58,179 --> 03:42:00,728
MATT: "It is a very strange hour."

2719
03:42:00,728 --> 03:42:07,953
SAM: Well, where we come from, it's a totally
different time. We've come to complete our promise

2720
03:42:07,953 --> 03:42:16,477
to you. The fact that we are here should give you
at least some confidence that we are men of our words.

2721
03:42:16,477 --> 03:42:18,012
MATT: "Aye, it was close."

2722
03:42:18,012 --> 03:42:23,643
SAM: As a show of good faith, could you please
instruct your guards to go get our weapons and

2723
03:42:23,643 --> 03:42:28,116
bring them close to us? Not for any use, we just
want them close by.

2724
03:42:28,116 --> 03:42:34,698
MATT: "You are not among enemies. Your weapons
will stay where they are while we speak."

2725
03:42:34,698 --> 03:42:40,261
SAM: We really would like them close to us.

2726
03:42:40,261 --> 03:42:42,519
MATT: "Then you should leave."

2727
03:42:42,519 --> 03:42:50,062
SAM: All right. Then we'll leave, and the dragon
will torment your people forever.

2728
03:42:50,062 --> 03:42:52,527
MATT: "That is your choice."

2729
03:42:52,527 --> 03:43:01,759
LIAM: We came with a whole fucking plan. Do you
want to hear about it?

2730
03:43:01,759 --> 03:43:07,055
MATT: "I would love to hear about it, but I do not
talk to people who stumble into my home before the

2731
03:43:07,055 --> 03:43:10,987
"sun rises with weapons and arms at their side."

2732
03:43:10,987 --> 03:43:15,832
SAM: We are not trying to have weapons by our
side, we want them close at hand. I don't trust

2733
03:43:15,832 --> 03:43:18,623
them with people I don't know.

2734
03:43:18,623 --> 03:43:23,577
MATT: "They will not be touched! Everyone is
sleeping, foolish gnome."

2735
03:43:23,577 --> 03:43:27,690
LIAM: We came to report, and we'll get out of
here, all right?

2736
03:43:27,690 --> 03:43:34,045
SAM: Here's the plan. We'll be quick so you can
get back to sleep. Tomorrow morning, we're going

2737
03:43:34,045 --> 03:43:40,390
to release a beast that will, we hope, lure the
dragon out of its lair. We want you and your

2738
03:43:40,390 --> 03:43:43,778
people at the ready to attack. Can that be done?

2739
03:43:43,778 --> 03:43:47,058
MATT: "That can be done, yes."

2740
03:43:47,058 --> 03:43:51,759
SAM: And where would you recommend we release this
beast?

2741
03:43:51,759 --> 03:44:05,804
MATT: Her eyes curl up with a slight, slick sound
of older, not-as-moisturized lizard eyes. You see

2742
03:44:05,804 --> 03:44:23,170
these eyelids click across as she thinks. "Across,
to the northern side of the ravine, the ramp leads

2743
03:44:23,170 --> 03:44:41,331
"up. Up that ramp, you will see a circle of stones,
a hundred feet across. That should suffice."

2744
03:44:41,331 --> 03:44:43,008
SAM: Insight check.

2745
03:44:43,008 --> 03:44:44,248
MATT: Make it.

2746
03:44:44,248 --> 03:44:49,226
SAM: 16.

2747
03:44:49,226 --> 03:44:50,760
MATT: 16?

2748
03:44:50,760 --> 03:44:56,707
SAM: I get a whisper! Who will talk about Loot
Crate?

2749
03:44:56,707 --> 03:45:00,593
LIAM: Man, so many good things about Loot Crate.

2750
03:45:00,593 --> 03:45:09,015
TRAVIS: It's a horror theme this month, you guys.
Friday the 13th. Halloween. Nightmare on Elm

2751
03:45:09,015 --> 03:45:11,965
Street. Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

2752
03:45:11,965 --> 03:45:17,385
TALIESIN: I'm a Halloween fan, myself.

2753
03:45:17,385 --> 03:45:24,437
SAM: Is there any particular time that the dragon
would be hungry for a hunt?

2754
03:45:24,437 --> 03:45:30,227
MATT: "The dragon is always hungry for a hunt.
It's hungry now, I'm sure."

2755
03:45:30,227 --> 03:45:38,462
SAM: And once this hunt happens, and hopefully
weakens the dragon, will you be ready to pounce?

2756
03:45:38,462 --> 03:45:40,827
MATT: "We will be ready."

2757
03:45:40,827 --> 03:45:46,610
SAM: All right. How do we get word to you that
we're in position?

2758
03:45:46,610 --> 03:45:50,619
MATT: "We'll be ready."

2759
03:45:50,619 --> 03:45:54,675
SAM: Okay. Anything else?

2760
03:45:54,675 --> 03:46:06,031
LIAM: The thing we're going to release is gnarly,
so give it a little bit of space.

2761
03:46:06,031 --> 03:46:09,804
MATT: "I will tell my men."

2762
03:46:09,804 --> 03:46:17,624
LIAM: All right, good chat. Scanlan, want to head
back to the pad?

2763
03:46:17,624 --> 03:46:21,420
SAM: Unless you'd like to talk about anything else
tonight?

2764
03:46:21,420 --> 03:46:23,916
MATT: "Please, leave me."

2765
03:46:23,916 --> 03:46:31,103
SAM: Not a morning person? Evening person?

2766
03:46:31,103 --> 03:46:33,536
LIAM: Hey, let's go get our shit and get out of
here.

2767
03:46:33,536 --> 03:46:34,939
SAM: All right.

2768
03:46:34,939 --> 03:46:39,339
LIAM: I grab him by the scruff of the neck and
start pulling him out of the room.

2769
03:46:39,339 --> 03:46:43,169
MATT: You guys leave the tent, make your way back.
Your weapons are right where you dropped them.

2770
03:46:43,169 --> 03:46:51,091
SAM: (hyperventilating)

2771
03:46:51,091 --> 03:46:57,051
LIAM: I'm so sorry, Simon. I should never have
left you in there. Love you.

2772
03:46:57,051 --> 03:47:02,587
MATT: You make your way out toward where the
cavern opens into the ravine itself. The snow is

2773
03:47:02,587 --> 03:47:10,546
still a good foot and a half up now, up the
ravine. What do you guys do?

2774
03:47:10,546 --> 03:47:14,472
LIAM: How long has it been since I bamfed out the
wings? An hour?

2775
03:47:14,472 --> 03:47:18,256
MATT: I'd say it's getting pretty close. You're
not quite sure of the exact time.

2776
03:47:18,256 --> 03:47:21,122
LIAM: Start going up toward the ridge.

2777
03:47:21,122 --> 03:47:23,672
SAM: I hope this doesn't make us fall!

2778
03:47:23,672 --> 03:47:27,395
MATT: All right. You take the wind, the cold wind
hitting the wings. Even though they're an

2779
03:47:27,395 --> 03:47:32,483
extension of the armor, you feel this twinge of
cold hit you. Thankfully you have your resistance

2780
03:47:32,483 --> 03:47:33,957
up, so it's helping with that.

2781
03:47:33,957 --> 03:47:35,731
SAM: One more Invisibility for both of us.

2782
03:47:35,731 --> 03:47:37,462
MATT: All right.

2783
03:47:37,462 --> 03:47:38,948
LAURA: That's <i>important</i>.

2784
03:47:38,948 --> 03:47:43,039
MATT: Thank you for noting that.

2785
03:47:43,039 --> 03:47:45,309
LIAM: This is intense.

2786
03:47:45,309 --> 03:47:49,288
TRAVIS: (laughing) His hand was like, all right.

2787
03:47:49,288 --> 03:47:54,107
MATT: All right. You guys invisibly coast up
through the ravine.

2788
03:47:54,107 --> 03:48:01,079
TRAVIS: Did you hear the garment of the reaper as
he walked past you?

2789
03:48:01,079 --> 03:48:05,611
(laughter)

2790
03:48:05,611 --> 03:48:08,137
TRAVIS: "Thank you for noting that."

2791
03:48:08,137 --> 03:48:18,337
MATT: Making your way up onto the top of the
cliffside, into a soft bank of snow. Keyleth,

2792
03:48:18,337 --> 03:48:24,342
you do hear the (soft impact) of several footfalls
maybe 40 feet to the left of you. You look over to

2793
03:48:24,342 --> 03:48:26,963
see an indentation in the snow.

2794
03:48:26,963 --> 03:48:30,149
MARISHA: I start pacing that way, assuming it's
them.

2795
03:48:30,149 --> 03:48:35,546
MATT: You guys watch Minxie emerge from the
darkness and snow.

2796
03:48:35,546 --> 03:48:37,965
MARISHA: (meows)

2797
03:48:37,965 --> 03:48:45,123
SAM: Hi, Random Cat Who Is Definitely Supposed To
Be Part of This Landscape. Let's go.

2798
03:48:45,123 --> 03:48:54,262
MARISHA: I got this form from being in the
mountains of my hometown, so yes.

2799
03:48:54,262 --> 03:48:56,271
MATT: You hear, (nonsense meowing).

2800
03:48:56,271 --> 03:48:58,328
(laughter)

2801
03:48:58,328 --> 03:48:59,722
SAM: Can we ride?

2802
03:48:59,722 --> 03:49:01,040
LIAM: Yeah, can we get a lift?

2803
03:49:01,040 --> 03:49:04,622
SAM: I can, probably. I'm little.

2804
03:49:04,622 --> 03:49:06,509
MATT: You both could ride Minxie.

2805
03:49:06,509 --> 03:49:08,069
LIAM: You're massive, aren't you?

2806
03:49:08,069 --> 03:49:10,507
MARISHA: They can ride me? I'm that big?

2807
03:49:10,507 --> 03:49:15,730
MATT: I mean, not full, but they could both be on
your back and you'd be like, (strained noises).

2808
03:49:15,730 --> 03:49:17,233
You could carry them along.

2809
03:49:17,233 --> 03:49:19,837
MARISHA: (strained noises) Back hurts. Come on.

2810
03:49:19,837 --> 03:49:25,657
MATT: You eventually bring them back to the
outside of the door, with Vex waiting for you on

2811
03:49:25,657 --> 03:49:31,898
the stoop. You guys make your way into the warm
interior of Scanlan's mansion, where Kima is

2812
03:49:31,898 --> 03:49:39,105
currently de-armored and snoring, leaning against
the foyer wall. You guys prepare yourselves for an

2813
03:49:39,105 --> 03:49:44,328
evening's rest, for tomorrow, you battle one,
possibly two dragons.

2814
03:49:44,328 --> 03:49:50,229
And that's where we're going to leave the session
for tonight. We'll be back here next week for

2815
03:49:50,229 --> 03:49:52,540
whatever this chaos is going to be.

2816
03:49:52,540 --> 03:49:55,942
SAM: Are you ready to rumble?!

2817
03:49:55,942 --> 03:50:01,501
MATT: We've got Yenk the goristro coming in versus
Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, versus Raishan, the

2818
03:50:01,501 --> 03:50:04,007
Diseased Deceiver.

2819
03:50:04,007 --> 03:50:05,775
LAURA: The Diseased--?

2820
03:50:05,775 --> 03:50:07,469
MATT: The Diseased Deceiver.

2821
03:50:07,469 --> 03:50:12,651
MARISHA: The Diseased Deceiver! Well, I'm going to
write that down.

2822
03:50:12,651 --> 03:50:18,015
TALIESIN: Nothing is going to go wrong. Everything
is great.

2823
03:50:18,015 --> 03:50:23,404
TRAVIS: And we set ourselves up for it.

2824
03:50:23,404 --> 03:50:25,523
SAM: I think we've got a really solid plan.

2825
03:50:25,523 --> 03:50:27,525
LIAM: Two massive enemies.

2826
03:50:27,525 --> 03:50:28,910
TALIESIN: And an army.

2827
03:50:28,910 --> 03:50:34,477
SAM: Also, there's a really good chance that I
won't be able to summon that thing, and then we'll

2828
03:50:34,477 --> 03:50:35,781
have to improvise.

2829
03:50:35,781 --> 03:50:38,054
LAURA: Oh god, I didn't think about that.

2830
03:50:38,054 --> 03:50:48,390
MATT: Don't roll low. Don't roll low, Sam.
<i>Please</i> don't roll low. That would be so bad.

2831
03:50:48,390 --> 03:50:49,984
SAM: Or so great!

2832
03:50:49,984 --> 03:50:51,709
MATT: Or so great.

2833
03:50:51,709 --> 03:50:54,369
MARISHA: Can I use Enhance Ability to help him out
with his spellcasting?

2834
03:50:54,369 --> 03:50:59,750
SAM: The thing has a DC. A very high DC.

2835
03:50:59,750 --> 03:51:08,048
MATT: You're probably pretty good because you have
a high enough charisma. For you, Enhance Ability,

2836
03:51:08,048 --> 03:51:09,181
let's see.

2837
03:51:09,181 --> 03:51:15,149
LAURA: Can you inspire yourself when you're
casting a spell?

2838
03:51:15,149 --> 03:51:16,546
SAM: I don't know, can I?

2839
03:51:16,546 --> 03:51:23,671
MATT: Let me look at the rules for this. It should
say on the scroll. What do you have to roll?

2840
03:51:23,671 --> 03:51:25,433
SAM: I didn't bring any of my stuff tonight.

2841
03:51:25,433 --> 03:51:31,414
MATT: Actually, Enhance Ability might help with
that. It does give advantage on checks to the

2842
03:51:31,414 --> 03:51:38,080
specific ability, which would be charisma. So it
would be Eagle's Splendor, you would get advantage

2843
03:51:38,080 --> 03:51:39,342
on charisma checks.

2844
03:51:39,342 --> 03:51:40,465
SAM: Eagle's Splendor?

2845
03:51:40,465 --> 03:51:46,499
MARISHA: Yeah, they've got fancy names for each
one, like Cat's Grace, Eagle's Splendor.

2846
03:51:46,499 --> 03:51:52,999
MATT: So in theory, that could help. We'll define
it more. I'll look at the scroll I wrote up, look

2847
03:51:52,999 --> 03:51:57,660
at the rule, make sure we confirm that before next
episode, but yes. That is probably a possibility.

2848
03:51:57,660 --> 03:52:02,578
And if this is an ability check, you could also
inspire yourself with a d12.

2849
03:52:02,578 --> 03:52:05,014
MARISHA: Honey badger Spock, is that what you just
said?

2850
03:52:05,014 --> 03:52:12,153
MATT: Anyway, start thinking how you're going to
handle this next week, guys. You've got a week to

2851
03:52:12,153 --> 03:52:13,829
pull this together.

2852
03:52:13,829 --> 03:52:17,952
MARISHA: Yeah, we can talk this time!

2853
03:52:17,952 --> 03:52:19,562
LIAM: Sure. We're in the mansion.

2854
03:52:19,562 --> 03:52:23,944
MATT: Yeah, you guys are having a whole night
where you can work this out.

2855
03:52:23,944 --> 03:52:28,060
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm annoyed that I know what
that perception check was about, and that Percy

2856
03:52:28,060 --> 03:52:30,118
doesn't know. It really annoys me.

2857
03:52:30,118 --> 03:52:31,119
MATT: You don't know.

2858
03:52:31,119 --> 03:52:32,105
TALIESIN: Yeah, I do.

2859
03:52:32,105 --> 03:52:36,894
MATT: Anyway, guys, well done. Great game tonight.
Thank you guys for watching. We'll be back here

2860
03:52:36,894 --> 03:52:40,727
next week, on Thursday. Is it Thursday yet?

2861
03:52:40,727 --> 03:59:33,104
