NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer. I am a
voice actor and the Dungeon Master for Critical

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.129
Role here at Geek &amp; Sundry, and today's episode of
GM tips is going to discuss some suggestions I

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.460
have should you be inspired to homebrew your own
RPG content.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.590 line:1
[intro music]

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.031
Now homebrewing, or creating original game content
for a campaign or system, can be very inspiring

00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:28.271
and fulfilling, whether it be creating your own
character class options or new ideas for abilities

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:32.799
and equipment, it's an exercise in design and
creative writing that can really improve your

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:37.678
understanding of the game, and aide in customizing
your players' experiences. It's also a process

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:43.014
fraught with many challenges, and easily-made
mistakes. Here, I hope to discuss a few of these

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:46.280
elements to help you take a crack at it, should
you be so inclined.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.034 line:1
First up, custom player content. This generally
involves new player options not in the official

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:55.832
books. Using D&amp;D as an example, the creation of
new feats, new class abilities or archetypes, and

00:00:55.832 --> 00:01:00.371
entirely new character classes would fall into
this category. Now, mind you, homebrew isn't only

00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:05.182
the realm of the GM either. Designing new spells
for your sorcerer is a fun and creative pastime

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:09.598
for many players, and originally how some of these
damn spells got designed in the first place. I'm

00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:14.510
looking at you, Melf and Bigby. Which, by the way,
is there no greater name for a mage than Melf?

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.811
It's like you already know about him with just
that. Take a guess what sex and race Melf was.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:25.761
Also, can I mention, his flair for alliteration?
Man, it's all been downhill since. Anyway, before

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:28.831
you do anything, perhaps have a decent knowledge
of the rules as well.

00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:33.991
Now, when designing new player features and
options, first, begin with the idea. What makes it

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:38.899 line:1
unique and cool against all the existing options?
Does it add a missing mechanical element to your

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.906
games, or bring a fun new narrative flavor to it?
Write down the messy initial design and function

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:49.919
of the new idea. Wow, that was complicated and
over written, isn't it? That's okay! Now, think

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:54.870
about the terminology and how you can condense and
simplify it. Use existing rules and similar

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.672
abilities in the core books as inspiration for
verbage. Try your best to make it as concise and

00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:01.900
easy to understand as possible.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.731 line:1
Now, following the design, do some research to
make sure it hasn't already been done. Look on the

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.480 line:1
internet, scour come homebrew forums, and wikis
for existing content that is similar to what

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.671
you've designed. This will help inform you if
you've wandered into already-treaded territory.

00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:19.580
And, if you have, that's okay! You now have a
great example to learn from and can now either

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.913
adopt elements of or the entire existing homebrew
or alter your own design to be unique against the

00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:30.190
discovered predecessor. Just remember, if you
borrow or use existing homebrew content, always

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.429
give credit. Seriously.

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:37.550 line:1
Next, compare the power level and capability of
the new feature to existing official abilities.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.491
Our instincts sometimes is to make something cool
also be <i>really fucking powerful</i>! And you can use

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:46.902
this period to reel is back a bit, and try to
balance it within the game system. Consider many

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:51.340
different scenarios you can see this ability being
used in. Consider any possible synergies it may

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.181
have with other character class abilities, items,
or feats that might make it unintentionally

00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:00.870
strong. Even playtest it yourself, or with the
willing friend who is happy to work for pizza or

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.980
backrubs, in a number of stress test circumstances
or scenarios where you feel it could be exploited.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.211
Then, record your feedback, and adjust or tweak
the ability to better fit within the existing

00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.545
boundaries of the game system’s balance.

00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:18.400 line:1
When designing new character classes, repeat the
above steps for each new feature once you've

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.393 line:1
completed the initial design. I know, it's a
lengthy process, but it's also extremely important

00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:27.579
to ensure you both learn about the core boundaries
of the system’s intended balance, and it helps you

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.899
end up feeling like you've made something wholly
unique and fresh.

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:35.891
The next step will require some bravery, and while
not required, I highly recommend it. Post your

00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:41.482 line:1
design on the internet for feedback. There are
some amazing communities that enjoy and focus on

00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:46.320
homebrew content, and aiding in its creation. Like
Reddit's D&amp;D Homebrew, or Unearthed Arcana

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.661
Communities. Many experienced designers, with a
keen eye for the pitfalls of early homebrew can

00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:55.441
quickly help you shape up your design. Some of
these same people can sometimes be rather blunt

00:03:55.441 --> 00:04:00.102
and dry with their feedback. But know it comes
from a place of honest intent to help. And don't

00:04:00.102 --> 00:04:04.271
take any of it personally please. We are all in
these places of the web to share and learn.

00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:07.961
Now, when you're feeling confident in your design,
go ahead and offer it to your players. Have them

00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:13.881
take a read and perhaps one or more may with to
give it a spin in the future. If not, no worries.

00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:16.811
You have plenty of NPCs who can bring it on down
the road.

00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.712 line:1
There are also emerging places where you can
upload your homebrew content for others to use and

00:04:20.712 --> 00:04:24.980
enjoy. The aforementioned reddit communities also
enjoy completed homebrew releases, as well as the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.460
DM's Guild at dmsguild.com, an official community
open store where you can upload your completed D&amp;D

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.980
content for the community to purchase, write, and
utilize. Even possibly make you a little pocket

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.569
change. I would recommend you read the guidelines
for such places before uploading to ensure the

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.243
quality of the materials you present and the legal
details are kosher with you. This is also a great

00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:48.670
resource for researching any existing content that
may be similar to your design in earlier stages.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.261
Now if you are a player designing new abilities,
items, or spells for your character to utilize,

00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:58.091
you can go through all these same steps, but you
have one big difference. You need to also work

00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:02.361 line:1
with your GM and their approval. They will be a
great resources, and really the only needed source

00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:06.170
to use this for your home game, through the
process. And it's their final approval you need

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.820
before you can use any of your designs. Let them
know early of your intent. I hope these have been

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.611
helpful for you and any other tips you may have
picked up in this video. Thank you so much for

00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.930
watching, and I'll see you on the internet.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:36.498
