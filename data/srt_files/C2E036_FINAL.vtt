NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.152
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.152 --> 00:00:05.618
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:07.916
TRAVIS: (silly voice) Dungeons & Dragons!

00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:11.279
MATT: Like that. Before we jump into tonight's
episode, we have some quick announcements to get

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.121
through. First off, we have two fantastic sponsors
for tonight's episode! Our good friends for the

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:21.368
whole campaign, D&D Beyond, which we'll get to in
just a second, and tonight a recurring friend

00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:25.200
who's come by to say hi for this episode, our
friends at Backblaze. Sam?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.747
SAM: Hi everyone! This time next week, we'll be
doing this show in New York City!

00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:36.355
LAURA: New York City!

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:42.465
SAM: Get a rope. So I thought I would write
Backblaze a New York-style Broadway advertisement

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:51.101
to celebrate! Hit it, boys! (vaudeville music)
Dateline, the Big Apple. 42nd Street is buzzing

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:56.114
with the latest smash Broadway sensation:
Backblaze! The dazzling new musical the Times

00:00:56.114 --> 00:01:02.376
calls: "Aces! Keen! The best cloud-based backup
storage musical since Cats!" Theater critic Yav

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:07.410
Brantley raves: "All my data, movies, music, and
character sheets were copied to a secure location.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.545
"And that was just act one!" Dames and fellas alike
are shaking a leg to Backblaze on Broadway! With

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:22.950
music by Andrew Lloyd Website and Cameron
Mac-or-PC, the spectacle features glitzy stars

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:33.439
like Data Rivera, Computer Streisand, and the
young starlet Angela Lansbury. Backblaze will get

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.926
your toes tapping with songs like "Some Enchanted
Upload," "I Could Have Backed Up All Night," and

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:45.672
"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Encryption." Plus,
Blaza Minnelli and her tap dancing hard drives!

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:50.981
Punky Winkerbean of the New York Daily News hails,
"I've never seen a closing number where the lead

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:55.449
"character re-installs an operating system from a
backup disc he received via the mail! I smell

00:01:55.449 --> 00:02:03.204
"Tony!" The best part? Tickets are just $5 a month!
That's a five-spot with no gimmicks, add-ons, or

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:08.491
gotchas. Go to backblaze.com/criticalrole to start
a free trial, and let them know Crit Role sent

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:13.848
you! Curtain up! Light the lights! Run, don't walk
to Backblaze on Broadway!

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:16.190
(applause)

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.963
LAURA: That was great.

00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:20.670
MARISHA: Brava!

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.993
SAM: I like that one of your own shitty puns made
you drop the voice entirely.

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:28.769
MARISHA: Sam is my favorite when he's judging his
own jokes.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.956
SAM: Thank you, Taliesin, for this stunning
Broadway style.

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:37.347
MATT: Its second appearance now on Critical Role.

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:43.144
MARISHA: I feel like someone needs to name a bong
Blaza Minnelli, by the way. That's a perfect bong name.

00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:45.016
MATT: Get to it, Critters.

00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:48.732
(laughter)

00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:54.048
MATT: And, as I mentioned before, thank you again,
our friends at D&D Beyond for being our second

00:02:54.053 --> 00:02:57.525
sponsor for tonight's episode. We've mentioned
before, and we'll say it again, the new Waterdeep:

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:02.345
Dragon Heist adventure from Dungeons & Dragons
that I got to consult on and am super proud of is

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:10.378
now available on D&D Beyond, that's dndbeyond.com.
It will guide players from levels one to five, it

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:16.957
has a lot of fun events to it, and a cool heist
rush-adventure story. It's really cool. After

00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:20.942
that, you can also explore the legendary
Undermountain Dungeon below the city of Waterdeep,

00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:27.894
called the Dungeon of the Mad Mage, which is
levels five to 20. It's quite a bulky bit! It's

00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:33.821
pretty cool, I was just in Seattle a couple of
days ago at their office and I got to see some of

00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:40.656
the stuff that's in the book, it's pretty badass.
They've put out one piece of art that has the mind

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:45.527
flayer pirate captain in one of the stages, which
is basically Davy Jones. It's Davy Jones, but he's

00:03:45.527 --> 00:03:48.258
a mind flayer. It's pretty great. But there's a
lot of fun stuff in there, I'm excited for you

00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:54.567
guys to check it out. That will be available for
preorder on dndbeyond.com right now and will be

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:59.246
released November 2nd, so go check it out. Let's
see, other announcements to get through.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:01.661
TRAVIS: Chick-a-chick ah!

00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:10.495
MATT: Bow bow! Jesus. It's the five golden rings
thing. You can't resist it. Next week, guys, we

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:15.677
are in New York. We are at New York Comic Con with
our live show next Thursday. Tickets are still

00:04:15.677 --> 00:04:21.318
available. It's at the United Palace in Washington
Heights next Thursday the 4th. They're available

00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:25.561
now via Ticketmaster. You don't need a badge to
the convention to attend, it's completely offsite

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:30.903
and a separate entity, so come join us! If you're
attending New York Comic Con be sure to pick

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:34.732
up a presale ticket to come meet us at the
convention as well, we have panels going on, it's

00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:42.944
going to be crazy. You can find all the events and
information for it at critrole.com/events. We also

00:04:42.944 --> 00:04:45.854
have a bunch of shows that are all happening now!

00:04:45.854 --> 00:04:46.994
TRAVIS: Yeah, man!

00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:53.623
MATT: All developed and put to the test and given
creation from our fantastic creative director,

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:55.063
Marisha Ray.

00:04:55.063 --> 00:04:56.852
ALL: Yay!

00:04:56.852 --> 00:05:00.587
LIAM: Yaas, queen! She's working her butt off.

00:05:00.587 --> 00:05:02.182
MARISHA: I'm so tired.

00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:03.586
LIAM: Working her butt off.

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:06.028
MATT: I know. The latest episode of Between the
Sheets, starring our fantastic Travis Willingham,

00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:12.478
aired this Monday-- it was great-- is now
available on YouTube. If you didn't get a chance

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.220
to see it then or subscribe to our Twitch, it's on
YouTube now for free.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.544
MARISHA: Go watch it!

00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:18.014
MATT: Go watch it, it's really great.

00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:19.032
SAM: Or listen to it.

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:23.047
MATT: Yes, that's right, the podcast as well.

00:05:23.047 --> 00:05:24.970
TRAVIS: They might get me confused with you just
because our voices are so--

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:28.990
MATT: It's true, that happens all the time. Laura
will be the next guest on Between the Sheets next

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.315
week, so you get to look for that next Monday on
twitch.tv/criticalrole.

00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:35.887
LAURA: I wonder what I said.

00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:38.778
MARISHA: Luckily we recorded it all.

00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:43.708
MATT: There you go. That'll be live at 7:00pm this
coming Monday at twitch.tv/criticalrole, or you

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:51.003
can watch it on YouTube the following Wednesday.
Our newest show, All Work No Play, are these two

00:05:51.003 --> 00:05:53.732
buggers who have returned, too.

00:05:53.732 --> 00:05:55.147
SAM: That's tomorrow night.

00:05:55.147 --> 00:06:01.776
MATT: Tomorrow night, also at 7:00pm Pacific here
at twitch.tv/criticalrole. Look for that, it's a

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:06.790
continuation of their grand podcast from ages
past. It's real special.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.130
LIAM: We're going to jump in the chat.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.665
SAM: We're going to jump in the shat?

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.582
LIAM: We're going to jump in the shat.

00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:16.333
TRAVIS: That's a good activity.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.449
LIAM: We're going to shat in the chat tomorrow
night during the show.

00:06:19.466 --> 00:06:21.226
ALL: Shat chat.

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:27.901
MATT: I'm sure that's an old AOL chat room that no
one wants to go to. But yeah, tomorrow night, look

00:06:27.901 --> 00:06:32.360
forward to that. Let's see, merch, Laura, you have
some announcements?

00:06:32.557 --> 00:06:35.468
LAURA: Yeah. Oh my gosh. We have our first Keyleth
shirt.

00:06:35.468 --> 00:06:36.936
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:06:36.936 --> 00:06:38.426
SAM: It's out?

00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:41.582
LAURA: It's in the store right now! There's two
styles; we got our "Sleeves are Bullshit" shirt--

00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:43.269
why don't we have it?

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.105
TALIESIN and MARISHA: We did have one.

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:46.401
SAM: Where is it? I still haven't seen it!

00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:49.121
LAURA: We'll bring it out during the break; it's
really cool. Go check it out at Crit Role:

00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:56.285
shop.critrole.com. You know, they've got one
that's sleeveless, that's a girl's, and then one

00:06:56.285 --> 00:07:02.690
that's unisex that's not as sleeveless. And those
are pre-order, so if you order them, they're going

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.343
to ship in two weeks, so that means they're not
sold out immediately, so that's really great for

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:14.156
people that want to actually get them. We also
have our Deven Rue maps. By the way, that

00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:19.754
Keyfish-- this Keyfish-- was designed by Lauryn
Ipsum, who's phenomenal and we know her from her

00:07:19.754 --> 00:07:25.785
work on the artbooks. We have our mini Yasha bust
in the store right now; we have the Wildemount

00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:30.122
dice that are still in the store right now, and
there's other stuff like a bumper sticker that you

00:07:30.122 --> 00:07:32.838
can proclaim-- I keep talking about the bumper
sticker.

00:07:32.838 --> 00:07:34.939
MARISHA: Traveler is my co-pilot.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.353
TRAVIS: Trying to spread that good word.

00:07:36.353 --> 00:07:37.697
LAURA: That's right.

00:07:37.697 --> 00:07:40.249
TALIESIN: You want to see one on the 405 one day,
don't you?

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:42.257
LAURA: I do! I really want to see the bumper
sticker.

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:44.772
TRAVIS: Just run up and bumper tap them.

00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:48.500
TALIESIN: They get out and they see Laura and go,
"Ah!"

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:51.409
LIAM: Do I see the shirt waiting in the wings
right now? We do.

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:54.189
MARISHA: Yes! Hey, Vinny!

00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:58.632
LAURA: This is the uni-sexy one. It's so
uni-sexy.

00:07:58.758 --> 00:08:00.286
SAM: Oh, wow.

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:02.777
LAURA: (British accent) Look, I don't know if you
can see it, but it's a goldfish with little dice

00:08:02.777 --> 00:08:08.904
trailing behind, and then there's a special little
treat at the bottom that says, "It's fine, we're gods."

00:08:08.904 --> 00:08:11.160
SAM: Oh, that's so cool!

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.604
LIAM: That fish looks so disturbed.

00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:14.762
TALIESIN: It is a very disturbed fish, yeah.

00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:16.708
MARISHA: That fish has instant regrets.

00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:19.194
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like it jumped off a cliff and
killed myself for no reason.

00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:20.521
MARISHA: "What did I do?"

00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:23.720
TRAVIS: With nothing achieved.

00:08:23.887 --> 00:08:28.294
MARISHA: We just lost money on that death. It was
a very expensive death.

00:08:28.294 --> 00:08:30.259
TRAVIS: I loved it. So good.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:34.188
MATT: All right then, guys. I believe that's the
end of my announcements, unless you have anything

00:08:34.188 --> 00:08:42.696
to add to that. I think it's time for us to get
into this heroic adventure, and as a celebration

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:49.725
of other real heroes in this world, some by the
name of Christine. Let's take our way down

00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:53.022
to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:08:54.282 --> 00:08:57.034
[TV static, click]

00:09:02.765 --> 00:10:16.020
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:26.835
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty
Nein had been following a story thread. They had

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:31.600
encountered some pieces of paper that alluded to a
mystical orb that they had previously encountered

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:39.882
that seemed to be related to something about your
patron, Fjord. After unknowingly having a vision

00:10:39.882 --> 00:10:45.508
and absorbing this orb within yourself, you
completed your business up in the Empire, and

00:10:45.508 --> 00:10:50.357
following information in this note, you made your
way south outside of the Dwendalian Empire to the

00:10:50.357 --> 00:10:57.863
Menagerie Coast to the city of Nicodranas, which
was home-- and is home-- to Jester.

00:10:57.863 --> 00:10:59.682
MARISHA: Freudian slip.

00:10:59.682 --> 00:11:07.161
MATT: Yeah. Bought some pets along the way, lost
some pets along the way, but you met the Ruby of

00:11:07.161 --> 00:11:14.093
the Sea. You aided her in absolving herself of the
stress of having a really, unfortunately

00:11:14.093 --> 00:11:21.013
aggressive admirer who was becoming a serious
problem, so you told him to stop by cutting off

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.877
his hand and sending him away forever.

00:11:22.877 --> 00:11:25.316
SAM: Yeah, and killing all of his friends.

00:11:25.316 --> 00:11:33.461
MATT: Then you went to inquire the docks at night,
looking for an individual named Marius LePual.

00:11:33.461 --> 00:11:36.555
MARISHA: It's bad when you say it like that.

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:40.705
TRAVIS: The recap really sticks it in and turns
it.

00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:45.718
MATT: You stealthed you way there, began to
formulate a plan to listen in. Unfortunately, due

00:11:45.718 --> 00:11:52.325
to a not quite as quiet attempt at entering the
water, garnished their attention. A not quite

00:11:52.325 --> 00:12:01.175
effective attempt at deceiving them triggered them
to realize that they were being followed and

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:06.683
proceeded to try and cover their tracks and take
out those who would be following them. That led to

00:12:06.683 --> 00:12:15.193
a scuffle in the battlefield of the docks here in
the wharf where you alerted the guards, managed to

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:20.469
take down these shadowy figures, captured Marius
LePual, and hijacked their ship called The Mist,

00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:29.634
where you managed to leave the docks out into the
night air, the moonlit open night. You had just

00:12:29.634 --> 00:12:33.408
managed to take down a few figures that remained
on the ship, a few things were burned in the

00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:42.056
process. The chaos was palpable. Caduceus managed
to swim out to you guys in time to make it onto

00:12:42.056 --> 00:12:49.486
the ship, and where we left off, you all had taken
a moment, and some of you began to head back into

00:12:49.486 --> 00:13:00.634
the ship to see what lied within. Mighty Nein,
what would you like to do?

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:10.007
LIAM: Well, you know, all told, I think that went
very well. It could've been worse; they attacked

00:13:10.007 --> 00:13:17.306
us, unprovoked. I know that we were not exactly
normal-seeming to them, but we did not get

00:13:17.306 --> 00:13:24.474
threatening with them. They made the first move,
and it just unraveled from there, what can you do?

00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:27.776
Sometimes, you just have to follow the cabbages in
front of you.

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:30.675
MARISHA: What?

00:13:30.675 --> 00:13:34.465
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm at the helm. Is there anybody
down below, seeing about that?

00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:36.581
MATT: Jester, I think, was rushing down.

00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:41.453
LAURA: I was on my way down, right when I stuck an
axe in the back of a guy's head.

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:43.721
LIAM: What did you say?

00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.113
MARISHA: That's right.

00:13:45.113 --> 00:13:50.457
LAURA: I accidentally stuck an axe in the back of
a guy's head. I didn't mean to though, I was

00:13:50.457 --> 00:13:52.568
aiming for his shoulder.

00:13:52.568 --> 00:13:56.371
MARISHA: You can Speak with Dead though, right? Is
that something you can do?

00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.961
LAURA: I can do that.

00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:00.876
MARISHA: Maybe that's how we interrogate him?

00:14:00.876 --> 00:14:02.753
LAURA: I don't know if I have it prepared,
though.

00:14:02.753 --> 00:14:04.135
SAM: We could sleep on it.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:05.543
MATT: Who's heading down?

00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:09.080
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say, I'm at the helm.
Beau, if you'll stay with me. We need to--

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.055
LAURA: I do have it prepared!

00:14:11.055 --> 00:14:14.620
TRAVIS: We need to check the ship for damages
because we tried to blow it up a couple of times,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.719
and then if the rest want to head down and see
what's below.

00:14:17.719 --> 00:14:19.939
SAM: I'll come with.

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:22.857
MATT: Jester and Nott? Who else?

00:14:22.857 --> 00:14:24.729
LIAM: I will go down as well.

00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:26.106
MATT: Okay, and Caleb. Caduceus, you're staying
up. Yasha's--

00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:32.161
TALIESIN: I am going to just sit at the front of
the ship, wet, and I'm not in any of this right

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:36.923
TRAVIS: Any chance you want to come up and help
me? I pull a big piece of splintered wood out of

00:14:36.923 --> 00:14:41.599
my forehead, throw it over to the side. In time,
I'm good.

00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:44.464
MARISHA: I'll help you out.

00:14:44.464 --> 00:14:46.282
TRAVIS: Thanks.

00:14:46.282 --> 00:14:49.999
MATT: Yasha steps over to you, Caduceus, and
she puts a hand to your shoulder and she goes,

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:52.412
"Glad you're okay."

00:14:52.412 --> 00:14:55.801
TALIESIN: You keep leaving.

00:14:55.801 --> 00:14:59.543
MATT: "You keep finding me. Or they do."

00:14:59.543 --> 00:15:02.452
TALIESIN: I think you might have the right idea.

00:15:02.452 --> 00:15:05.093
SAM: (whispering) Oh no.

00:15:05.093 --> 00:15:08.321
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to sit.

00:15:08.321 --> 00:15:13.376
MATT: Yasha stands up, looks back towards you
guys, goes over and takes a rope and begins

00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:20.004
helping you guys hold onto the sails, watching you
and figuring out what to do. None of you have ever

00:15:20.004 --> 00:15:21.897
really run a boat before.

00:15:21.897 --> 00:15:25.984
MARISHA: Yasha's following me? I'm like: You can
follow me, but I'm just--

00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:28.704
MATT: Well, she's just helping you out with
whatever you need on the ship.

00:15:28.704 --> 00:15:32.510
TRAVIS: I'll bark out: Make sure the sails are
open, tighten all the everything off, and then

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:37.742
check the exterior of the ship if you can just for
breaks in the wood, fire marks, any damage that

00:15:37.742 --> 00:15:39.048
you can see.

00:15:39.048 --> 00:15:41.511
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:43.544
MARISHA: 15.

00:15:43.544 --> 00:15:47.793
MATT: Okay, glancing over the side where the
Fireball had impacted, a lot of the wood is

00:15:47.904 --> 00:15:55.584
charred black. There is visible sign of burning.
Nothing is on fire, but there was a flash-burn.

00:15:55.584 --> 00:16:01.296
Some of the wood right around the edge of the
deck is broken and splintered in a bit and part of

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:07.216
the sail underneath was burned and singed. Not
enough to the point where it tore it away from the

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:15.519
mast. But there is visible damage, but nothing that
impedes your movement. Just more aesthetic damage.

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:19.537
MARISHA: It just looks more dope now.

00:16:19.537 --> 00:16:21.760
TRAVIS: More dope?

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.420
MARISHA: Yeah, we look like badasses. I think it
makes the ship look cooler.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.237
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:28.911
MARISHA: Yeah, we look rad.

00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.501
TRAVIS: Less fancy will actually do us some good
in these waters, so that's good.

00:16:31.501 --> 00:16:33.411
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:36.499
MATT: You guys head down. Jester, as you're the
first person down, the first thing you notice is

00:16:36.499 --> 00:16:42.868
at the bottom of the steps, you see the fellow
with the axe stuck in him and he's on his stomach

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:46.031
and slowly crawling forward.

00:16:46.031 --> 00:16:48.163
LAURA: He's not dead!

00:16:48.163 --> 00:16:49.485
SAM: Heal him!

00:16:49.485 --> 00:16:50.804
LAURA: I'm out of spells.

00:16:50.804 --> 00:16:54.850
SAM: Take the axe out of him.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.479
LIAM: Is it better to pull it out or leave it in
place?

00:16:57.479 --> 00:17:01.663
LAURA: Is it like a puncture wound? Can I cast--

00:17:01.663 --> 00:17:05.303
SAM: I'll ask him. Would you like us to leave the
axe in or take it out?

00:17:05.303 --> 00:17:09.949
MATT: He looks over his shoulder. You see the
blood streaks down the side of his face and--

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:13.180
(groaning) begins to crawl quicker away from you.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.594
LAURA: No, no, no. I hold onto his ankles.

00:17:15.594 --> 00:17:19.290
MATT: (groaning) His fingernails are scraping
against the wood floor.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:24.005
LAURA: I know it's really terrible. I'm sorry that
I did this, I hope you're okay.

00:17:24.005 --> 00:17:26.435
SAM: Can't you do healing or anything?

00:17:26.435 --> 00:17:29.991
LAURA: I mean I can cast Spare the Dying, but he's
already not--

00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:31.231
SAM: Spared?

00:17:31.231 --> 00:17:32.910
LAURA: Yeah: dying.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.246
MATT: That's when he passes out.

00:17:34.246 --> 00:17:36.117
LAURA: I cast Spare the Dying.

00:17:36.117 --> 00:17:38.550
MATT: Okay. He's just like, "Ugh."

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.927
LIAM: We're just going to leave hole in his head
like Phineas Gage?

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:46.895
LAURA: Well, I think, you know, maybe Deuce could
do something about it?

00:17:46.895 --> 00:17:50.167
SAM: Do you want me to go get Deuce?

00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:53.476
LAURA: Yeah. See if he'll come down here for a
moment.

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:55.035
SAM: All right, I'll run up there and get him.

00:17:55.035 --> 00:18:00.707
LIAM: I'm just going to move the axe head a
centimeter or two.

00:18:00.707 --> 00:18:05.860
LAURA: Don't move the axe! What if his brain
starts leaking out?! Don't do it!

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.457
SAM: If you press on it, can you get his hand to
move?

00:18:09.457 --> 00:18:11.903
TRAVIS: Give it a little flick.

00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:14.899
LAURA: That's so messed up.

00:18:14.899 --> 00:18:21.637
MATT: Nott, as you rush up to the shadowed deck of
The Mist, the moonlight still coming down, you can

00:18:21.637 --> 00:18:27.117
see the outer shape of the still-damp Caduceus,
legs tucked into his shoulder, leaning back

00:18:27.117 --> 00:18:32.048
against the inside of the left hand of the deck,
or what would be considered the port side.

00:18:32.048 --> 00:18:36.534
SAM: Mr. Clay? You look-- are you okay?

00:18:36.534 --> 00:18:41.403
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's been a day. It's hard
to gauge.

00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:46.335
SAM: Yeah. Are you cold?

00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:48.628
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:55.593
SAM: I have this cloak that would maybe fit one of
your shoulders?

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:58.504
TALIESIN: I'm going to be okay.

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:03.644
SAM: Well, if you can muster the strength, it
would be great if you could come downstairs and

00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:07.064
maybe help save an individual's life?

00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:14.417
TALIESIN: I'll get up and go down. See what's down
there.

00:19:14.417 --> 00:19:21.809
MATT: The quarters of this ship, it's designed to
be not a comfortable ship, but a fast ship. The

00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:28.898
crew's quarters and the deck below was called--
for bigger ships, it'd be the gun deck, but it's

00:19:28.898 --> 00:19:37.164
where the cabin is. It's pretty tight for a human.
Caduceus, you're have to really bend and stoop

00:19:37.164 --> 00:19:42.944
down to make your way through. But as you come
down, you find both Jester and Caleb currently

00:19:42.944 --> 00:19:48.946
sitting around an unconscious enforcer, one of the
cloaked figures that was involved with the crew

00:19:48.946 --> 00:19:50.623
that previously had this ship.

00:19:50.623 --> 00:19:55.413
LAURA: He got an axe in his head.

00:19:55.413 --> 00:19:58.865
TALIESIN: It's probably good you didn't pull it
out.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:01.600
LAURA: Yeah, see!

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:08.164
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to tap him on the head
and cast Healing Word at 3rd-level.

00:20:08.164 --> 00:20:10.369
MATT: Okay.

00:20:10.369 --> 00:20:15.819
TALIESIN: That's 11 points right there.

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:18.201
MATT: Okay.

00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:20.983
LIAM: As soon as Cad's hands start to glow, I yank
the axe out of his head.

00:20:20.983 --> 00:20:26.122
MATT: Okay, you yank it out and there's a streak
of blood and you watch as what would be the open

00:20:26.122 --> 00:20:32.925
axe wound begins to slowly seal itself up to the
point where it's still going to be healing for a

00:20:32.925 --> 00:20:35.634
while, but it scabbed over instantaneously.

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:40.440
SAM: Look, you just saved a life! That's good
news, right?

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.667
TALIESIN: Well, he'll be dead eventually. I'm
going to head back upstairs.

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:46.330
MATT: Okay.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:50.015
TRAVIS: Fuck me! Oh god! Help!

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:52.371
MATT: Caduceus heads back upstairs.

00:20:52.371 --> 00:20:55.725
LIAM: Caduceus is America tonight.

00:20:55.725 --> 00:20:58.562
TALIESIN: Too real.

00:20:58.562 --> 00:21:05.165
MATT: The person comes to consciousness
immediately as the axe is pulled. (gasping) You

00:21:05.165 --> 00:21:10.166
get a better look at him now. You can see
scruffed, probably unshaven for the past two

00:21:10.166 --> 00:21:12.849
weeks, coming out in tufts. It looks like there
are parts where the hair isn't growing in because

00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:19.897
there's scarring or some sort of heavy acne at a
younger age prevented those follicles from

00:21:19.897 --> 00:21:29.072
developing. Pockmarked face, weathered from sun
and perpetual sunburns. You can see the actual

00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:36.498
hair itself is a matted, greasy mess of a light
brown color. Looks like the kind of person you'd

00:21:36.498 --> 00:21:41.768
imagine lives at sea and not in a very monetarily
comfortable income.

00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:45.456
LAURA: Oh hi, bud.

00:21:45.456 --> 00:21:52.395
MATT: "What's that? Who the fuck are you?"

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:54.954
LIAM: Jester, this is your axe.

00:21:54.954 --> 00:21:56.514
LAURA: Thank you.

00:21:56.514 --> 00:21:58.040
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:07.508
LAURA: So we have this ship now, but I just wanted
to say: Hi, welcome to the crew! You know, we're

00:22:07.508 --> 00:22:14.922
The Mighty Nein! All your friends are gone right
now, but it's because you attacked us first, really.

00:22:14.922 --> 00:22:19.965
MATT: "Just following orders, sorry."

00:22:19.965 --> 00:22:23.898
LAURA: No, see! That's okay! I understand
following orders.

00:22:23.898 --> 00:22:25.614
SAM and LAURA: Uh-huh.

00:22:25.614 --> 00:22:31.246
SAM: Yes, we are a tight crew that follows orders
as well. Caleb is our leader, and we--

00:22:31.246 --> 00:22:32.923
LAURA: Hmm.

00:22:32.923 --> 00:22:38.108
SAM: We are enforcers of justice and saw that
justice needed to be done.

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:42.127
MATT: "I don't know anything about that."

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.710
LAURA: What were you guys doing?

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.555
MATT: "We were delivering a message, picking up a
message."

00:22:49.555 --> 00:22:51.192
LAURA: That's it?

00:22:51.192 --> 00:22:53.487
SAM: A whole boat just for a message?

00:22:53.487 --> 00:23:01.859
MATT: "Well--" In his position right now, he's
being trepidatious in giving you information. The

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:07.339
more you're prying, the more he's closing off and
his words are trailing off. "I don't--"

00:23:07.339 --> 00:23:14.690
LIAM: Well, buddy, we're at sea now. We are not at
the dock any more. You are trapped with us. We

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:19.160
have questions and I don't want to alarm you. None
of us want to put an axe in your head or anything.

00:23:19.588 --> 00:23:22.431
LAURA: No, I don't want to do that. That was
really sad.

00:23:22.431 --> 00:23:31.739
LIAM: Right, we want to just get along. We're all
tired. I'm tired, <i>but</i> I'll go to work if I need to.

00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:33.015
TRAVIS: Oh jesus christ!

00:23:33.015 --> 00:23:35.545
(laughter)

00:23:35.545 --> 00:23:37.089
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:23:37.486 --> 00:23:39.149
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:41.439
LAURA: That's so terrible!

00:23:41.439 --> 00:23:43.231
TRAVIS: Fuck!

00:23:43.231 --> 00:23:45.025
TRAVIS and MARISHA: <i>But!</i>

00:23:45.025 --> 00:23:48.498
MARISHA: I was going to say, that's how we know
Caleb is serious! <i>But!</i>

00:23:48.498 --> 00:23:51.368
TRAVIS: We'll be listening to him lift that rocking
chair outside.

00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:53.035
LIAM: 18.

00:23:53.035 --> 00:24:02.576
MATT: 18. His whole body tenses, his eyes dart
around the three of you and then slackens and he

00:24:02.576 --> 00:24:12.536
exhales in a sense of resignation. "You know what?
Fuck, I'll tell you what you want. Anything you

00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:19.086
"need to know. Just-- can you let me go? Drop me
back off in town or something?"

00:24:19.086 --> 00:24:25.397
LAURA: Yeah, I think that seems like something
we're going to do.

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:29.766
LIAM: The easy route is what I'm talking about.
Good decision.

00:24:29.766 --> 00:24:35.797
MATT: "Yeah, well, it's not worth it." He sits up
and you see that he's bruised and even though he's

00:24:35.797 --> 00:24:43.146
been healed, he's not used to the aftermath of
physical confrontation the way you guys are. He's

00:24:43.146 --> 00:24:46.577
like (groaning), leans up against the table a bit
and puts his back against it so he's leaning

00:24:46.577 --> 00:24:51.164
against the leg and top of it. (groaning)

00:24:51.164 --> 00:24:56.797
LAURA: Who do you work for?

00:24:56.797 --> 00:25:03.234
LIAM: We have a lot of questions, so tell us
everything.

00:25:03.234 --> 00:25:10.229
MATT: "This is The Mist. We're a sister ship to
Captain Avantika's. Our captain was Captain

00:25:10.229 --> 00:25:14.548
"Jawgrasp, but I take it you probably killed him
too."

00:25:14.548 --> 00:25:16.826
LAURA: He attacked us first, you know.

00:25:16.826 --> 00:25:24.139
MATT: "Well, it makes sense. We're not supposed to
leave any survivors who've seen what they

00:25:24.139 --> 00:25:26.249
"shouldn't have seen. General business."

00:25:26.249 --> 00:25:28.027
LAURA: Oh, really? Why?

00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:31.299
MATT: "Just don't want to be followed. It's part
of our directive."

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:33.009
SAM: Are you pirates?

00:25:33.009 --> 00:25:41.300
MATT: "More or less. We'll just say we're not keen
on the taxation and enforcement of the Concord on

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.401
"these seas. So we do what we feel is necessary."

00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:48.758
LAURA: I like it.

00:25:48.758 --> 00:25:50.148
SAM: Freedom fighters.

00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:51.629
MATT: "Yeah."

00:25:51.629 --> 00:25:57.408
SAM: You said that you're sister ship to Captain
Avantika?

00:25:57.408 --> 00:25:59.098
MATT: "The Squalleater, that's her ship."

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.063
LAURA, MATT, and LIAM: The Squalleater.

00:26:03.063 --> 00:26:06.234
SAM: Ah yes, we did know that.

00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:07.923
LAURA: Yes, we did.

00:26:07.923 --> 00:26:13.802
LIAM: Gesturing to the desk and all the burned
papers: What's all this, then? What was this that

00:26:13.802 --> 00:26:16.374
we can't read anymore?

00:26:16.411 --> 00:26:24.991
MATT: "Primarily it was maps to locations of
things that were important. For our travels."

00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:26.952
LIAM: Like?

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:33.582
MATT: "Like things that-- I wasn't the navigator!
I didn't know specifically, but I was told to

00:26:33.582 --> 00:26:35.503
"burn everything."

00:26:35.503 --> 00:26:38.136
LAURA: Is there some stuff you didn't get to?

00:26:38.136 --> 00:26:45.318
MATT: You rummaged through and found a few things.
Most of it's scrap and ash, or blank sheets that

00:26:45.318 --> 00:26:52.134
look like they were scribbled notes in a code that
you don't really understand. This is the only

00:26:52.134 --> 00:26:53.916
visible thing.

00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:57.191
TRAVIS: Oh yes, Matthew! Do us right! Ooh!

00:26:57.191 --> 00:27:05.670
LIAM: Take care of him. I pull out the book and I
begin to do the ritual for Comprehend Languages

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.039
to see if that will help with the code. It's a long shot,
but I'll give it a shot.

00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:12.658
LAURA: What was the message you were trying to
get?

00:27:12.658 --> 00:27:23.336
MATT: "We were sent by Avantika to head back to
Nicodranas, and we're supposed to wait for about a

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:33.288
"week or two. Interface with that guy Marius.
Either he was going to pay us back for the money,

00:27:33.288 --> 00:27:38.805
"if he didn't get what he was supposed to find, and
if he did have what he was supposed to deliver--

00:27:38.805 --> 00:27:47.240
"one of the things I burned was a drawing of it, it
was an orb thing. We were supposed to take that

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.062
"back to Avantika."

00:27:49.062 --> 00:27:50.571
SAM: Where is Avantika?

00:27:50.571 --> 00:28:00.268
MATT: "Avantika's on-- what's the island called? I
don't remember. Don't fucking remember what it

00:28:00.268 --> 00:28:03.822
"was called. It was on there! That's it right there."

00:28:03.822 --> 00:28:06.161
SAM: Is it a secret island?

00:28:06.161 --> 00:28:12.001
MATT: "It's not a secret; it's just mostly
avoided. It's near one of the reef clusters of the

00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:13.838
"Lucidian Ocean, this side of the coast."

00:28:13.838 --> 00:28:17.785
LAURA: Do you see it, Caleb? Do you see it?

00:28:17.785 --> 00:28:20.938
LIAM: I'm doing a ritual spell for 11 minutes.

00:28:20.938 --> 00:28:25.610
LAURA: Do you think Mending would help fix that,
or would it make the piece of paper come together?

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.384
TRAVIS: Yeah, great fucking call.

00:28:27.384 --> 00:28:30.065
LAURA: Mending!

00:28:30.343 --> 00:28:34.300
MATT: All right, you do the Mending cantrip, and
because I do not have a completed map for you,

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.122
we'll use our imagination.

00:28:36.122 --> 00:28:37.835
LIAM: D&D!

00:28:37.835 --> 00:28:42.070
MATT: It completes a much larger piece of paper,
that you think would have a bunch of other either

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:48.703
islands or the things around it. It looks like it
may have been a much larger size. Unfortunately,

00:28:48.703 --> 00:28:53.246
the ink does not come through on it.

00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:55.398
MARISHA: But we still have the ink of that.

00:28:55.398 --> 00:28:59.335
MATT: You still have the ink of that, yeah. It's
a large piece of paper that is mostly blank, and

00:28:59.335 --> 00:29:03.839
then there's that one section that is stained with
the burned edges and has the actual drawing.

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:06.540
LIAM: Oh wow, so it spread out blank from-- that's
cool.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.802
LAURA: Okay.

00:29:09.802 --> 00:29:12.028
SAM: So it's an island.

00:29:12.028 --> 00:29:15.425
LIAM: The code was where? You said there was a
code, I thought?

00:29:15.425 --> 00:29:23.347
MATT: There was some things with bits of coded
language on it, it looked like. But those have

00:29:23.347 --> 00:29:29.107
also been burned, and they're in chunks. You do
your--?

00:29:29.107 --> 00:29:34.029
LIAM: Yeah, it takes ten-ish minutes to do
Comprehend Languages, and if I'm touching--

00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:36.507
MATT: Is it ten minute casting time?

00:29:36.507 --> 00:29:40.385
LIAM: It is ten minutes plus one minute as a
ritual. So yeah.

00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:42.511
MATT: As a ritual, it's whatever the duration
is--

00:29:42.511 --> 00:29:45.748
LIAM: Casting time: one action, plus ten minutes.

00:29:45.748 --> 00:29:50.169
MATT: One action plus ten minutes, okay. There you
go. Then it would be a total of 11 minutes. All

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:56.060
righty. While you're working on that, you guys can
continue to pry, if you want.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:00.585
LAURA: If we drop you off, are you going to change
your name or something? Are you afraid Avantika is

00:30:00.585 --> 00:30:02.983
going to come and kill you?

00:30:02.983 --> 00:30:11.623
MATT: "I mean, probably lay low for a while.
There's other jobs out there. Find my way back to

00:30:11.623 --> 00:30:13.545
"Darktow eventually."

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.027
SAM: Tell us about-- oh, sorry.

00:30:15.027 --> 00:30:17.331
LAURA: No, you go. You go next.

00:30:17.331 --> 00:30:21.877
SAM: Oh, all right. Tell us about Avantika.

00:30:21.877 --> 00:30:28.725
MATT: "She's a weird one. Her whole crew, they've
got some weird mystical thing they're obsessed with."

00:30:28.725 --> 00:30:31.475
LAURA: Like the ball? Is it the ball?

00:30:31.475 --> 00:30:35.850
MATT: "That's one of the things we're supposed to
be picking up, yeah. They've got some creepy

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:43.027
"religious thing. We work for her. She hired us as
the sister ship out of Darktow and we've been

00:30:43.027 --> 00:30:44.915
"doing errands for her."

00:30:44.915 --> 00:30:47.370
LAURA: Docktow?

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.123
MATT: "Darktow, yeah."

00:30:50.123 --> 00:30:51.365
LAURA: What's that?

00:30:51.365 --> 00:30:57.006
MATT: "It's generally the hub of most unlawful
activity out here. Used to belong to the Concord,

00:30:57.006 --> 00:31:03.990
"but about 50 years back, it was taken by people of
my professional interests and they haven't been

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.919
"able to take it back since."

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:07.990
LIAM: You're talking about a place, an island, a
building?

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.475
MATT: "Yeah, it's an island."

00:31:09.475 --> 00:31:13.756
SAM: Wait, we already know what the islands are.
Swavain Islands. I can't even read my writing.

00:31:13.756 --> 00:31:17.147
That's where we were told Avantika is.

00:31:17.147 --> 00:31:18.568
LAURA: Is that what this is? Swavain Islands?

00:31:18.568 --> 00:31:20.966
MATT: "Swavain Islands is the whole series of
islands."

00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:23.233
TRAVIS: It's a cluster out in the Lucidian Ocean.

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:25.986
MARISHA: And Darktow is also an island?

00:31:25.986 --> 00:31:29.190
MATT: "Darktow is one of the islands far, far west
of here, though."

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:33.611
LAURA: Why does it say Y, Y, Y, Y?

00:31:33.869 --> 00:31:35.436
SAM: I think those could be little pointers.

00:31:35.436 --> 00:31:41.183
MATT: "I'm not the navigator, but I remember going
in and out. There were little markers set on areas

00:31:41.183 --> 00:31:48.875
"where we were supposed to-- like visual guides if
we were on the right paths and to help us get

00:31:48.875 --> 00:31:50.961
"through the reef."

00:31:50.961 --> 00:31:52.588
LAURA: Because it's on the other side of the
reef.

00:31:52.588 --> 00:31:54.817
MATT: "And to go around is another hundred miles
to your trip."

00:31:54.817 --> 00:31:56.852
LIAM: And you've made this trip yourself?

00:31:56.903 --> 00:32:01.155
MATT: "Yes. Well, we've made to and out once. We
were going to go back after this."

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.531
LIAM: What are the risks one would encounter
trying to traverse this area?

00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:06.356
MATT: Are you still working on your spell?

00:32:06.356 --> 00:32:07.541
LIAM: Oh.

00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:12.477
SAM: Do you live on the island? Does Avantika live
on the island?

00:32:12.477 --> 00:32:16.337
MATT: "Oh, god no. No one's going to fucking
settle on that thing. It's fucking cursed."

00:32:16.337 --> 00:32:18.271
SAM: The island is cursed?

00:32:18.271 --> 00:32:19.769
MATT: "Yeah!"

00:32:19.769 --> 00:32:23.416
SAM: So she docked there for a while, or--?

00:32:23.416 --> 00:32:28.301
MATT: "It's supposed to be something there that
she wants. Well, she's waiting on us to get back

00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:31.265
"with whatever we're supposed to pick up, and if
they didn't have it there, then we were supposed

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:34.436
"to try and find out where the next one might
possibly be."

00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:36.043
SAM: The next one?

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.790
LAURA: On the hunt for ancient relics.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:46.540
SAM: It's a dangerous game. Who knows how it will
end?

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.561
LAURA: Only two will find out.

00:32:49.561 --> 00:32:51.355
LAURA and SAM: Yeah!

00:32:51.355 --> 00:32:53.926
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:32:53.926 --> 00:32:57.813
TRAVIS: Jesus! Maybe I jump overboard.

00:32:57.813 --> 00:33:04.806
SAM: Can you tell us, because this is a bit shredded,
you were here before, right? You were here?

00:33:04.806 --> 00:33:06.508
LAURA: That's the island? That's where the island
is, then?

00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:09.428
MATT: "I think that's the island, yeah, it's
mostly jungle-covered."

00:33:09.428 --> 00:33:14.286
SAM: Did the wind blow you out, or did you fight
against the wind to leave? Was this east, is this

00:33:14.286 --> 00:33:16.486
west, where is this?

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.361
MATT: "I don't know." You get the sense the more
he looks at it, one, he's definitely not the

00:33:22.361 --> 00:33:27.063
navigator of the ship's crew, and probably can't
read.

00:33:27.063 --> 00:33:28.664
LAURA: What's your name?

00:33:28.664 --> 00:33:31.138
MATT: "Gallan."

00:33:31.138 --> 00:33:32.414
LAURA: Gallan.

00:33:32.414 --> 00:33:33.926
MATT: "Gallan Wesmen."

00:33:33.926 --> 00:33:35.614
LAURA: I like your name.

00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:37.421
MATT: "Thank you."

00:33:37.421 --> 00:33:39.348
LAURA: Have you heard of The Traveler, Gallan?

00:33:39.348 --> 00:33:41.079
MATT: "I've met many travelers."

00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:44.930
LAURA: Have you heard of <i>The</i> Traveler?

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.989
MATT: His eyes go a little narrow. He's like, "Oh
no, not another one."

00:33:48.989 --> 00:33:51.547
TRAVIS: Another one what?

00:33:51.547 --> 00:33:56.009
LAURA: Do you want maybe a brochure? I could tell
you about him.

00:33:56.009 --> 00:33:57.646
MATT: "I'm okay."

00:33:57.646 --> 00:34:01.344
LAURA: You could spread his name wherever you go.

00:34:01.344 --> 00:34:02.939
MATT: "I'll think on it."

00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:04.757
LAURA: All right.

00:34:04.757 --> 00:34:10.073
SAM: You've met Avantika, right? Sorry to
interrupt. I don't want to cut off your weird

00:34:10.073 --> 00:34:15.981
evangelizing, but you've met Avantika?

00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:20.079
MATT: "I've seen her. I've not actually spoken to
her, that was mainly--"

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:22.143
SAM: Have you seen her use any magic?

00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:24.341
MATT: "No. She mainly stays on the ship."

00:34:24.341 --> 00:34:26.561
LAURA: What does she look like?

00:34:26.561 --> 00:34:34.789
MATT: He scratches his head. "She's elf, I think.
She's got them elven features, the pointy ears,

00:34:34.789 --> 00:34:49.614
"the whole brown-red skin. Big hair that comes in
strings. Sleeveless coat, high collar, big scarf thing."

00:34:49.614 --> 00:34:55.708
MARISHA: I don't know, I got distracted by the
sleeveless coat aspect. That's all I heard.

00:34:55.708 --> 00:35:00.361
TRAVIS: When he gives descriptions and we don't
fucking writes notes, it bites us in the ass.

00:35:00.361 --> 00:35:07.477
MATT: "I didn't get all the details. I wasn't one
of the important ones."

00:35:07.477 --> 00:35:10.743
LAURA: You should be important!

00:35:10.743 --> 00:35:15.224
SAM: You survived this brutal attack. You are
extremely strong.

00:35:15.224 --> 00:35:18.679
MATT: He's sitting there going, "Yeah. Yeah you're
right."

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:21.417
SAM: Everyone else died. You had an axe in your
head!

00:35:21.417 --> 00:35:23.514
MATT: "Fuck them! Fuck them! I'm a survivor."

00:35:23.514 --> 00:35:25.646
SAM: You had an axe in your head! You survived!

00:35:25.646 --> 00:35:32.448
MATT: "I had a what?" He reaches back and is
like-- There's like still blood back there, of

00:35:32.558 --> 00:35:35.479
course, and he's like, "I'm okay? Is it bad?"

00:35:35.479 --> 00:35:40.648
SAM: It's nothing to you. It's nothing! Missed all
the major organs.

00:35:40.648 --> 00:35:45.095
(laughter)

00:35:45.329 --> 00:35:47.279
SAM: You're fine.

00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:48.536
LAURA: Yeah.

00:35:48.536 --> 00:35:51.771
SAM: What else do we need to know? Anything? How
about this ship, you know this ship? Is there

00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:56.926
anything funky on the ship? How much food stores
do we have? How many days of food and water?

00:35:56.926 --> 00:36:02.522
MATT: "Well we'd just stocked up so we've got
probably about two weeks of tack and water

00:36:02.522 --> 00:36:05.497
"and some ale below."

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.089
LAURA: Do you know how to sail?

00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:14.981
MATT: "I know how to repair. I was more of the
ship carpenter."

00:36:14.981 --> 00:36:20.517
SAM: You know what we should do first? Since we
have a carpenter on board?

00:36:20.517 --> 00:36:21.815
LAURA: What?

00:36:21.815 --> 00:36:23.836
SAM: On the side of the ship it says "The Mist."

00:36:23.836 --> 00:36:25.519
LAURA: We should change the name.

00:36:25.519 --> 00:36:27.174
SAM: We should get some new letters going.

00:36:27.174 --> 00:36:28.556
LAURA: Like Mysterious Ball. The Mysterious Ball.

00:36:28.556 --> 00:36:35.152
SAM: Yes, The Mistress of the Loins. I don't know,
what would be a good name?

00:36:35.152 --> 00:36:37.610
LAURA: The Mistake.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.505
SAM: That's not bad.

00:36:39.505 --> 00:36:43.477
TRAVIS: Kind of appropriate?

00:36:43.622 --> 00:36:44.702
MARISHA: The Mistake!

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.612
MATT: That's really on brand!

00:36:46.612 --> 00:36:48.864
SAM: We took The Mist, and now it's The Mistake.

00:36:48.864 --> 00:36:53.270
LIAM: Did my spell trigger yet?

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.196
TALIESIN: There's at least five jokes in there.

00:36:56.196 --> 00:37:00.206
MATT: I'll say sure. Technically ten minutes is a
while, but we'll say between the small talk,

00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:01.849
you've completed your spell.

00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:07.058
LIAM: Only because I want to say, the name as it
is, is fairly appropriate. We might want to change

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:12.496
it to change up our appearance and stuff. Do
you know what <i>Mist</i> means in Zemnian?

00:37:12.808 --> 00:37:15.006
SAM: Fog?

00:37:15.006 --> 00:37:17.856
LIAM: It means shit.

00:37:17.856 --> 00:37:19.353
LAURA: Does it?

00:37:19.353 --> 00:37:25.005
LIAM: Yeah, manure. Crap, it means crap. It's
pretty on brand for us, honestly.

00:37:25.005 --> 00:37:27.150
LAURA: I don't want to ride around in The Shit.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.818
LIAM: You've been doing it for several months now,
Jester.

00:37:31.873 --> 00:37:35.940
LAURA: You just draw it, you don't live in it.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:43.650
LIAM: We're going to add on to-- Mistake is funny,
too. I like that. Can I read this code?

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:55.304
MATT: Sure. With the slips that you have, you read
through it and it seems to be a list of supplies

00:37:55.304 --> 00:38:04.386
that were supposed to be purchased. A lot of them
seem to be heavy bits of rope, chains, climbing

00:38:04.427 --> 00:38:19.017
pitons. You see ball bearings, torches. You're not
quite sure why this was encoded, per se, and

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.653
only for the slips that you have that are visible,
but it's mainly just a list of materials.

00:38:22.653 --> 00:38:30.021
LIAM: Okay. See these squiggles here? This is
either just supplies, or maybe they are trying to

00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:33.231
make booby traps for their island. I don't know.

00:38:33.231 --> 00:38:44.467
SAM: Are there any intact maps, like larger scale
maps of the ocean?

00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:50.813
MATT: Unfortunately, no. You look around you and
there is ash everywhere. Even the air has bits of

00:38:50.813 --> 00:38:57.844
ash that are still floating in the space. They
burned-- through the purpose of that battle while

00:38:57.844 --> 00:39:01.450
you guys were dealing with all of that, this guy
was in here torching everything. You're lucky

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.445
to have gotten that bit.

00:39:03.604 --> 00:39:06.602
LAURA: Man, you did a really good job with what
you were told to do.

00:39:06.602 --> 00:39:12.708
MATT: "Thanks. I take pride in my work." He's
still touching the wound in the back of his

00:39:12.708 --> 00:39:15.764
head, unsettled.

00:39:15.764 --> 00:39:17.695
LIAM: Little ridge that he's not used to.

00:39:17.695 --> 00:39:19.773
SAM: Caduceus, are you down here?

00:39:19.773 --> 00:39:22.158
TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm not. Just me enjoying a head
wound.

00:39:22.158 --> 00:39:26.545
LAURA: Well, okay, I'm going to go upstairs.

00:39:26.545 --> 00:39:32.494
SAM: All right. Is he tied up? Are you tied up?

00:39:32.494 --> 00:39:34.130
LAURA: He's not tied up.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:37.648
MATT: "No. I can-- come on."

00:39:37.648 --> 00:39:39.507
LIAM: Do you have any weapons left on you?

00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:45.063
MATT: You look over, and he had a sword. The
thing he was swinging and attacking you guys with

00:39:45.063 --> 00:39:46.444
in the doorway earlier.

00:39:46.444 --> 00:39:47.666
LIAM: Does he have it now, or has he chucked it?

00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:50.356
MATT: No, it tumbled down the stairs when to took
an axe to the head.

00:39:50.356 --> 00:39:52.054
LAURA: I will take that.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.874
MATT: As you're taking it he's like, "Sorry about
that."

00:39:53.874 --> 00:39:56.714
LAURA: It's okay.

00:39:56.714 --> 00:39:58.775
MATT: "Profession."

00:39:58.815 --> 00:40:00.888
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:00.918 --> 00:40:05.408
LIAM: That's water under the bridge. We just don't
want any new problems, yeah? And there's a lot of

00:40:05.535 --> 00:40:07.614
us here; so it would be foolish to do anything,
right?

00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:09.873
MATT: "Yeah."

00:40:09.873 --> 00:40:13.050
SAM: You have now officially been conscribed to
The Mighty Nein--

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:14.624
LAURA: Temporarily.

00:40:14.624 --> 00:40:18.434
SAM: --for the purposes of this sea voyage, at the
end of which, you will be compensated for your

00:40:18.434 --> 00:40:22.685
duties. If you kill any of us, you will be thrown
overboard.

00:40:22.685 --> 00:40:27.965
LAURA: If you jump overboard, we'll jump after
you, and we'll bring you back.

00:40:27.965 --> 00:40:34.542
SAM: Also, as a result of us not mostly knowing
how to sail, you are also the first mate.

00:40:34.542 --> 00:40:37.536
MATT: "Okay."

00:40:37.536 --> 00:40:40.081
LAURA: Congratulations.

00:40:40.081 --> 00:40:44.230
TRAVIS: That's a big promotion for him. Carpenter
to first mate!

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.092
MARISHA: He's kind of the worst.

00:40:46.092 --> 00:40:48.204
SAM: Congratulations!

00:40:48.204 --> 00:40:49.477
MATT: "Okay."

00:40:49.477 --> 00:40:51.435
SAM: Welcome to The Mighty Nein.

00:40:51.435 --> 00:40:52.645
LIAM: You just got a come-up.

00:40:52.645 --> 00:40:58.548
MATT: "Thank you. Should I go get my stuff,
then?"

00:40:58.548 --> 00:41:01.234
SAM: You're the first mate! Why don't you give us
an order?!

00:41:01.234 --> 00:41:15.590
MATT: "Ah!" He points towards you and, "Um." He's
not a very intelligent fellow. "Go... fetch me

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.881
"some... dried meat."

00:41:18.881 --> 00:41:24.841
LAURA: Yeah, I don't feel doing that. Maybe you
should just go upstairs.

00:41:24.841 --> 00:41:27.121
MATT: "I'm going to go lay down for a minute."

00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:33.337
LAURA: Hmm, okay. I'm just going to tie your hands
while you're sleeping, though, okay?

00:41:33.337 --> 00:41:34.667
MATT: "Okay."

00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:35.898
LAURA: All right.

00:41:35.898 --> 00:41:44.678
MATT: You head down to the cabin quarters to one
of the small cots that are there, essentially, and

00:41:44.678 --> 00:41:47.815
tie him down. He's like, "Mmm." He passes out;
he's exhausted.

00:41:47.815 --> 00:41:50.347
LAURA: Poor guy!

00:41:50.347 --> 00:41:51.432
LIAM: You got a new pet.

00:41:51.432 --> 00:41:53.387
SAM: Let's call him--

00:41:53.387 --> 00:41:56.401
SAM and MARISHA: Professor Thaddeus!

00:41:56.474 --> 00:41:58.333
TALIESIN and MARISHA: The second!

00:41:58.333 --> 00:42:00.771
LAURA: What was his actual name?

00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:02.623
SAM and LAURA: Gallan.

00:42:02.623 --> 00:42:04.725
MATT: G-A-L-L-A-N.

00:42:04.725 --> 00:42:07.373
LIAM: Thaddeus Klossowski von Musel.

00:42:07.373 --> 00:42:09.847
MARISHA: The second.

00:42:09.847 --> 00:42:16.511
MATT: All right. While that's happening, the rest
of you on the surface, where are you taking it?

00:42:16.511 --> 00:42:19.663
TRAVIS: Time of day-ish?

00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:21.877
MATT: Time of <i>night</i>-ish.

00:42:21.877 --> 00:42:23.506
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:42:23.506 --> 00:42:27.233
MATT: Yeah, it's maybe 2:30, 3:00 in the morning,
at this point.

00:42:27.233 --> 00:42:32.674
TRAVIS: Straight out from shore, full sail. Just
trying to put distance between us and the coast.

00:42:32.688 --> 00:42:34.056
MATT: Got you. Okay.

00:42:34.056 --> 00:42:36.209
TRAVIS: I know we have time to decide on our
route.

00:42:36.209 --> 00:42:40.281
MATT: Yeah. But you just take some distance in
case of pursuit? Got you. It's a pretty quick

00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:47.584
ship. You can see why it was used as a messenger
ship. You're used to cargo ships and things that

00:42:47.584 --> 00:42:51.906
are used for shipping, so it's nice to have one
that's designed just for speed.

00:42:51.906 --> 00:42:57.774
TRAVIS: Ooh, sports car! Where is Marius?

00:42:57.774 --> 00:43:01.394
MATT: He's tied to the mast right now.

00:43:01.394 --> 00:43:04.182
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh, that's right!

00:43:04.182 --> 00:43:07.949
MATT: He's fallen asleep as well because he's just
been there while you guys were doing your thing.

00:43:08.024 --> 00:43:11.551
No one is paying attention to him, and he's had a
long day. He's like, (snoring).

00:43:11.551 --> 00:43:18.876
TRAVIS: Not to put you too at ease, navigating was
never really my thing, either. I'm better than

00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:22.438
most, but I do need to decide on where we're
going.

00:43:22.438 --> 00:43:24.313
MARISHA: Right.

00:43:24.313 --> 00:43:29.644
TRAVIS: If we want to use Marius, we're going to
have to wake his ass up and ask him some questions.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:32.150
MARISHA: You want me to wake him up?

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.779
TRAVIS: Yeah, wake him up.

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:37.025
MARISHA: All right, okay.

00:43:37.025 --> 00:43:39.502
TRAVIS: Not-- (stammers)

00:43:39.502 --> 00:43:41.430
MARISHA: (impact)

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:42.698
MATT: "Ugh!"

00:43:42.698 --> 00:43:44.830
MARISHA: That was gentle, right?

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:46.645
MATT: "What was that all about?"

00:43:46.645 --> 00:43:48.889
MARISHA: Good morning.

00:43:48.998 --> 00:43:51.039
MATT: "It's still dark."

00:43:51.039 --> 00:43:54.331
MARISHA: Don't think that far into it, man. It was
a cool line.

00:43:54.331 --> 00:44:00.683
MATT: "Okay. Was that necessary?"

00:44:00.683 --> 00:44:02.646
MARISHA: Probably not.

00:44:02.646 --> 00:44:08.592
TRAVIS: Yeah, probably not. Listen, we'll let you
go back to your slumber right quick. Where were

00:44:08.592 --> 00:44:13.533
you headed with this ship? I assume to meet up
with Avantika, yeah?

00:44:13.533 --> 00:44:16.963
MATT: "I wasn't headed anywhere. I was going
to give back their money and send them off on

00:44:16.963 --> 00:44:22.512
"their way, and you attacked, and they weren't
going to let me stay behind, I guess."

00:44:22.512 --> 00:44:26.505
TRAVIS: Right. But now we've changed your plans,
yes? You're with us?

00:44:26.505 --> 00:44:28.727
MATT: "Apparently!"

00:44:28.727 --> 00:44:33.200
TRAVIS: And Avantika needs the sphere, correct?

00:44:33.591 --> 00:44:35.957
MATT: "Well, I don't have it!"

00:44:35.957 --> 00:44:42.161
TRAVIS: No, but I do. Do you know where she is?
I'll reach behind my back and use Minor Image

00:44:42.161 --> 00:44:45.230
again and show the sphere.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:58.363
MATT: Right. "I don't really-- I was just hired to
pass on a letter and wait for some sort of an

00:44:58.363 --> 00:45:05.567
"arrival of that, and then it never came, and then
I asked for an extension in case it was just

00:45:05.567 --> 00:45:10.789
taking its time to get there. And then, never
showed up. So I had to return the money,

00:45:10.789 --> 00:45:17.461
"unfortunately. But you know, I like keeping a
reputation as a reliable messenger."

00:45:17.461 --> 00:45:19.753
TRAVIS: Who were you going to give this to?

00:45:19.753 --> 00:45:26.148
MATT: "I was going to give it to-- what's his
name, Captain Jawgrasp. Big fella, you cut

00:45:26.194 --> 00:45:28.257
"the fuck out of and kicked him off the side of the
docks."

00:45:28.257 --> 00:45:29.962
TRAVIS: Right.

00:45:29.962 --> 00:45:33.149
MARISHA: How many times have you worked with
Jawgrasp or Avantika in the past?

00:45:33.149 --> 00:45:35.760
MATT: "This is the second time."

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.530
MARISHA: And what were you doing for them before?

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:42.811
MATT: "Well, before they found me on the side of
the docks here at the wharf and they asked me if I

00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:45.286
"knew the quickest way to get this letter up north
to Shadycreek Run."

00:45:45.286 --> 00:45:52.033
TRAVIS: Shadycreek Run. Where we were. You
wouldn't happen to know where Jawgrasp called

00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:55.318
home, would you? Or where he was heading next?

00:45:55.318 --> 00:45:59.412
MATT: "Not a fucking clue, none of my business. I
don't ask questions of those who are, you know, a

00:45:59.412 --> 00:46:04.036
"full foot and a half taller than me and can
probably wipe the floor with me. I just nod,

00:46:04.036 --> 00:46:08.479
"take my money and do the job. Once again, I
have a reputation." (sniffs)

00:46:08.479 --> 00:46:10.860
TRAVIS: Do you feel comfortable on a ship?

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:17.023
MATT: "I feel comfortable all right, you know,
when I can fucking move! Sorry, sorry, I'm just

00:46:17.023 --> 00:46:19.121
"a bit grouchy."

00:46:19.121 --> 00:46:21.205
TRAVIS: We are kind of limiting him. He's got big
poofy sleeves and everything, he's not going to

00:46:21.205 --> 00:46:22.574
swim anywhere.

00:46:22.574 --> 00:46:25.620
MARISHA: Well that's his own damn fault he has
poofy sleeves.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.942
TRAVIS: You could rid him of that, I hear sleeves
are...

00:46:26.942 --> 00:46:28.483
MARISHA: Fucking bullshit.

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:30.997
MATT: "I paid good money for this shirt. Please
don't do anything--"

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.472
MARISHA: (ripping)

00:46:32.472 --> 00:46:34.677
(laughter)

00:46:34.677 --> 00:46:37.003
MATT: You rip them underneath the ropes as he is
tied to the mast.

00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:38.184
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:46:38.184 --> 00:46:40.840
MATT: You start tearing them off in chunks. He's
like, "No! No!"

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.336
TRAVIS: Hey, welcome to the crew of the-- well,
we'll have to rename this thing. And I'll summon

00:46:45.336 --> 00:46:47.342
the falchion and just swipe through the ropes.

00:46:47.342 --> 00:46:54.684
MATT: "Ah!" He starts pulling up the scrap of his
sleeves. "Do you have any idea how much I paid for this?"

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.766
MARISHA: Throw them overboard.

00:46:56.766 --> 00:47:01.910
(laughter)

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.769
MATT: "I'm going to remember this."

00:47:03.769 --> 00:47:05.747
MARISHA: Yeah, you should.

00:47:05.747 --> 00:47:07.519
MATT: He combs his hair over.

00:47:08.003 --> 00:47:11.890
MARISHA: It was a pretty fucking dope thing. Okay.
Here is the thing, this reputation you keep

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:15.111
talking about? That you are s<i>o</i> deeply concerned
about--

00:47:15.111 --> 00:47:17.101
MATT: He pulls a tooth out.

00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:19.313
TRAVIS: Oh, pal.

00:47:19.313 --> 00:47:23.617
MARISHA: Aw. Can I have it? (laughs) Deflect
missiles!

00:47:23.617 --> 00:47:29.414
TRAVIS: That seems unnecessarily adept.

00:47:29.414 --> 00:47:32.144
MATT: Roll a d10, see how many-- no.

00:47:32.144 --> 00:47:41.758
MARISHA: Why are you so concerned with this
reputation of yours? How long have you been

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:44.832
running around in the criminal underworld is what
I'm saying.

00:47:44.832 --> 00:47:48.951
MATT: "Not criminal, I'm not a criminal. I do
business with whoever pays well. I don't ask

00:47:48.951 --> 00:47:51.011
"questions, so I don't know if I've done any
crimes."

00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:54.971
TRAVIS: I can't tell, I don't know. Is he an innocent
middleman that doesn't know what he's

00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:56.348
shipping or is it just--

00:47:56.348 --> 00:48:01.937
MARISHA: No, I've met this type. He plays stupid,
that way if people start asking questions you've

00:48:01.937 --> 00:48:04.626
got disbelief.

00:48:04.626 --> 00:48:10.318
MATT: "Exactly! So if I don't know technically who
I'm involved with and what the larger scale of my

00:48:10.318 --> 00:48:15.445
"work is, if anybody starts asking questions, I'm
as dumb as the rest of them. It's got me this far."

00:48:15.445 --> 00:48:18.234
MARISHA: Still doesn't mean you're not a criminal
though.

00:48:18.234 --> 00:48:22.955
MATT: "That's for the people to decide."

00:48:22.955 --> 00:48:27.460
TRAVIS: Listen, what we're going to ask for is
that you be as forthcoming as you possibly can be.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.634
Would you mind walking over to the side of the
ship there, and tell me how far Nicodranas looks

00:48:31.634 --> 00:48:33.271
right now?

00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:39.338
MATT: He goes over and looks. "Can't see it."

00:48:39.338 --> 00:48:44.248
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can't see it, can you? Stuck with
us. So I'm going to need everything that comes out

00:48:44.248 --> 00:48:46.436
of your mouth to be the truth.

00:48:46.436 --> 00:48:50.711
MATT: "It has been the truth! Why am I lying to
you right now, you've destroyed my shirt, you've

00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:52.444
"made me lose a tooth--"

00:48:52.444 --> 00:48:57.067
TRAVIS: My goodness, he is very sensitive about
this. I'm just trying to set the tone for the ship.

00:48:57.067 --> 00:49:04.898
MATT: "Look, I'm a very anxious fellow. And when
things go ass up-- I'm having a breakdown right now."

00:49:05.065 --> 00:49:08.652
TRAVIS: Do me a favor. Go below decks and try and
find us some drink, will you?

00:49:08.652 --> 00:49:12.146
MATT: "Okay, sure, fine, I'll do that for you.
Whatever you want."

00:49:12.146 --> 00:49:14.464
MARISHA: Take a little walk, we'll continue
talking when you get back.

00:49:14.464 --> 00:49:15.941
TRAVIS: Jeez, yeah seriously.

00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:17.762
MARISHA: God, I hate him.

00:49:17.987 --> 00:49:20.784
MATT: Makes his way below deck and passes by these
guys.

00:49:20.784 --> 00:49:22.401
LAURA: Hi!

00:49:22.401 --> 00:49:24.289
MATT: "Hi."

00:49:24.289 --> 00:49:26.696
TRAVIS: Are they coming up?

00:49:26.696 --> 00:49:29.041
MATT: Yeah, they all come out and join you on the
deck.

00:49:29.041 --> 00:49:31.477
SAM: We found some crucial information.

00:49:31.477 --> 00:49:32.598
TRAVIS: Oh?

00:49:32.598 --> 00:49:35.188
LAURA: That guy who I stuck an ax in is actually
still alive.

00:49:35.386 --> 00:49:36.939
TRAVIS: No kidding!

00:49:36.939 --> 00:49:39.926
LAURA: Yeah, Caduceus saved his life and he's
really nice. He's a pretty nice fellow.

00:49:39.926 --> 00:49:42.513
SAM: He's your first mate now. And--

00:49:42.513 --> 00:49:44.413
TRAVIS: Ax-head is?

00:49:44.413 --> 00:49:45.980
SAM: Yeah, don't worry we took the ax out.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.562
LAURA: Well, Caleb did technically.

00:49:47.562 --> 00:49:55.299
SAM: And we have this map that goes to the Swaven
Islands? We heard the name earlier.

00:49:55.299 --> 00:49:57.821
MATT and MARISHA: Swavain.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:04.345
SAM: That's where we'll find Avantika. Who seems
to be some sort of cultist, right?

00:50:04.345 --> 00:50:08.435
LAURA: Yes, she's very religious and is interested
in relics.

00:50:08.435 --> 00:50:13.013
SAM: I mean, I assume she's a cultist. Maybe she
just is a very nice religious person.

00:50:13.013 --> 00:50:15.348
LAURA: Maybe she just likes to collect things.

00:50:15.348 --> 00:50:16.875
SAM: Yeah! But he said creepy.

00:50:16.875 --> 00:50:23.252
LAURA: He said that they were mysterious and her
whole crew had some sort of magic-y stuff.

00:50:23.252 --> 00:50:25.163
TRAVIS: About the sphere.

00:50:25.163 --> 00:50:30.812
SAM: He said that they were supposed to collect
this sphere, and if it wasn't available, to go

00:50:30.812 --> 00:50:33.868
look for <i>others.</i> How many have you swallowed?

00:50:33.868 --> 00:50:36.027
TRAVIS: One.

00:50:36.027 --> 00:50:40.819
LAURA: Imagine if you swallow another one, how
powerful would you become?

00:50:40.819 --> 00:50:43.195
LIAM: Then you'll have two balls.

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:47.143
MARISHA: Wait, does the ball make you powerful? Is
there something going on?

00:50:47.166 --> 00:50:53.808
TRAVIS: I certainly feel like I have gained
abilities, yeah. I don't know though. Is this

00:50:53.808 --> 00:50:56.761
where they were headed?

00:50:56.761 --> 00:51:01.320
SAM: This is where they were going to head after
they got the ball, yes.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.511
TRAVIS: This is a map to a reef. I know the reefs
of the Lucidian Ocean, this is very familiar.

00:51:04.511 --> 00:51:10.081
LAURA: Those are the arrows, are the ping-pong
points that you have to hit and then you get to

00:51:10.081 --> 00:51:11.825
the island that you--

00:51:11.825 --> 00:51:14.572
TRAVIS: Yeah, well otherwise you wreck the ship.

00:51:14.572 --> 00:51:17.242
LIAM: You recognise those specific points there?

00:51:17.242 --> 00:51:23.181
TRAVIS: Well, there's the Everplume Reef, there's
the Torrid Reef, but this looks like the Inkclaw Reef?

00:51:23.237 --> 00:51:39.902
MATT: Make a-- this would be a survival check,
since this is-- no. For you, make that a history

00:51:39.928 --> 00:51:46.078
check with advantage. Since it does fall into your
sailor background.

00:51:46.313 --> 00:51:48.841
TRAVIS: (groans) That was less. 11.

00:51:48.841 --> 00:51:54.573
MATT: It could be one of three reefs.

00:51:54.573 --> 00:51:57.444
MARISHA: The three you just named?

00:51:57.444 --> 00:52:00.580
TRAVIS: There are a lot. There're quite a few.

00:52:00.592 --> 00:52:12.219
MATT: Yeah. It's a toss up, you're not entirely
sure which one it is. Give me a second. I can

00:52:12.219 --> 00:52:16.142
probably narrow it down for you. Give me a second.

00:52:16.142 --> 00:52:21.571
TRAVIS: There are a few reefs that protect certain
islands. One of which is the Darktow Isle.

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:26.121
SAM: He said that, Darktow Port.

00:52:26.138 --> 00:52:28.654
TRAVIS: You don't want to go there.

00:52:28.654 --> 00:52:30.174
LAURA: He said it was bad.

00:52:30.174 --> 00:52:32.364
SAM: But he also said it was far away from the one
that Avantika was at.

00:52:32.364 --> 00:52:35.665
LAURA: He didn't make it sound like that's the one
that--

00:52:35.665 --> 00:52:38.734
SAM: He said it was far away from the one where--

00:52:38.734 --> 00:52:43.812
TRAVIS: That would narrow it to two in my mind. If
it's in the Lucidian Ocean. One is far northwest

00:52:43.812 --> 00:52:48.756
of the Darktow and one is more straight east by
several hundred miles.

00:52:48.756 --> 00:52:52.940
LIAM: We came here for the two of you. What are
you after?

00:52:52.940 --> 00:53:00.577
TRAVIS: What am I after? Well I'd like to see-- I
keep saying Avan-teek-a, but it's--

00:53:00.627 --> 00:53:05.917
LAURA: Avantika. Who knows, really? It could be
Avan-teek-a.

00:53:05.917 --> 00:53:10.724
TRAVIS: I want to know what she wants the sphere
for. I want to know why Vandren had it in the

00:53:10.724 --> 00:53:16.587
first place. What else are they looking for? Does
it have a brother, sister sphere? I don't know.

00:53:16.736 --> 00:53:18.760
LIAM: Why would we not want to go to this place?

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:26.565
TRAVIS: No, I do! This doesn't look like Darktow
to me. Darktow is more in a U shape. You really

00:53:26.565 --> 00:53:30.583
have to go around the whole damn thing to get in
without touching the reef. It's a pain in the ass.

00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:34.053
MATT: It could be either Inkclaw or it could be
Deep Row. Those are the two that come to mind.

00:53:34.053 --> 00:53:43.440
SAM: Aren't you just a little bit scared that this
person, Avantika, has spent all this time and

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.946
resources trying to get these things and you've
got one in you and we're going right towards her.

00:53:48.946 --> 00:53:51.170
Isn't that a little scary?

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:53.028
TRAVIS: No, that sounds great to me.

00:53:53.028 --> 00:53:54.538
MARISHA: I mean it sounds like she wants this
thing.

00:53:54.538 --> 00:53:56.426
SAM: But she might just chop you open and take it.

00:53:56.426 --> 00:53:58.446
TRAVIS: You wouldn't let her do that, would you?

00:53:58.446 --> 00:54:03.663
LAURA: We'll try not to. I really should sleep if
we're going to do that, though.

00:54:03.663 --> 00:54:07.919
TRAVIS: We have plenty of time, it's quite a
distance away. So it could either be the Deep Row

00:54:07.919 --> 00:54:10.251
Reef or it could be the Inkclaw Reef.

00:54:10.251 --> 00:54:20.191
LAURA: We should really figure it out. I wonder if
in the morning we can ask Gallan about it, maybe

00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:22.730
he knows one of those sound familiar.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.262
SAM: Oh yes, yes.

00:54:24.262 --> 00:54:30.794
TRAVIS: Fair enough. We'll have plenty of time, I
could-- well, we have to pick one. One's to the

00:54:30.794 --> 00:54:34.175
northwest and one's down to the southeast from
where we are now.

00:54:34.175 --> 00:54:37.586
SAM: Do we have to pick right now or can we-- oh
wow, those are two different directions (laughs).

00:54:37.586 --> 00:54:42.619
LAURA: Well, let me go downstairs and wake him
up.

00:54:42.619 --> 00:54:49.172
TRAVIS: If you want-- we do have the stars on our
side so we'll be able to navigate easier. We could

00:54:49.172 --> 00:54:50.641
drop sail and--

00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:53.461
LIAM: Yeah, north is that way, and I point north.

00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:59.016
TRAVIS: Oh, you're going to be so helpful in
this! You're the ship's navigator. I dub thee

00:54:59.016 --> 00:55:02.273
The Mist navigator.

00:55:02.273 --> 00:55:05.826
SAM: It's the Mistake now. We renamed the ship.

00:55:05.871 --> 00:55:08.000
TRAVIS: The what? The Mistake?

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.794
SAM and LAURA: The Mistake.

00:55:10.794 --> 00:55:12.290
SAM: Or the SS Mistake?

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:18.968
MARISHA: Wait, are you saying the Mis-Steak like a
good filet mignon or like a mistake?

00:55:18.968 --> 00:55:28.023
LIAM: Or you could put Zemnian and Common together
and make it the Shit-ake, if it's the Mistake.

00:55:28.023 --> 00:55:33.616
SAM: M-Y-S-T-A-K-E? We're all about spelling
things wrong, so maybe we should do that.

00:55:33.616 --> 00:55:44.441
TRAVIS: Do I remember if the Deep Row or the
Inkclaw, one is closer than the other?

00:55:44.463 --> 00:55:50.939
MATT: The Deep Row is a little bit further away,
that one's more to the west of where you guys are.

00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:55.667
There are a number of small islands all throughout
the various reefs that aren't on the larger maps.

00:55:55.667 --> 00:56:00.103
And you haven't been all over the coast, these are
all just from the trade routes you've done, and

00:56:00.103 --> 00:56:08.483
the things that aren't directly near or you'll pass on
the trade routes-- some things aren't even charted.

00:56:08.764 --> 00:56:14.438
TRAVIS: My knowledge is limited to what I've
journeyed through before. The Inkclaw is closer,

00:56:14.438 --> 00:56:20.280
we could try there-- at least set course for that
direction. How does that sound?

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.843
SAM: You're the captain!

00:56:22.843 --> 00:56:25.948
LAURA: Would we get there in two weeks? Because
that's how much food we have.

00:56:25.948 --> 00:56:28.623
MARISHA: Oh that's a good point.

00:56:28.623 --> 00:56:42.592
MATT: Well, travel-wise this would be-- say we put
this at the speed of a longship, so per day you

00:56:42.592 --> 00:56:54.841
could probably do about 72 miles in a longship. It
looks like travel to-- to which reef? To Inkclaw?

00:56:54.841 --> 00:57:02.092
It's about 230 or so, 250 miles from Nicodranas.

00:57:02.092 --> 00:57:04.206
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could do it.

00:57:04.206 --> 00:57:07.690
LIAM: Does someone need to man the ship at night
when most of us are sleeping?

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:12.151
TRAVIS: Yes, if nothing else to look out for other
ships.

00:57:12.151 --> 00:57:14.827
LAURA: And sea monsters.

00:57:14.827 --> 00:57:18.344
LIAM: Can we do that without any sailing
experience?

00:57:18.344 --> 00:57:25.531
MATT: That's the thing. As you consider, and you
know, it takes a number of people to maintain a

00:57:25.531 --> 00:57:32.655
ship. To go at the speed you would need to, you'd
need to have somebody who's manning the sails,

00:57:32.655 --> 00:57:40.476
somebody who's navigating the ship, somebody who's
actually necessary for maintaining the course--

00:57:40.476 --> 00:57:48.110
TRAVIS: I'll tell you what we could do. There's a
joint stop on the trade routes, an island called

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:52.505
Brokenbank, we could make it there. I'm familiar
with how we would get there and we could try and

00:57:52.505 --> 00:57:54.080
find some extra hands.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.374
LIAM: How far off?

00:57:55.374 --> 00:58:00.398
TRAVIS: Almost one-and-a-half times the distance I
think, --ish.

00:58:00.398 --> 00:58:03.354
SAM: Wait, farther?

00:58:03.354 --> 00:58:10.909
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've never sailed directly to the
Inkclaw Reef. I just know where it is because I've

00:58:10.909 --> 00:58:13.225
seen maps.

00:58:13.225 --> 00:58:18.438
LIAM: The other thing we could do is find a place
on the Menagerie Coast a good ways away from where

00:58:18.438 --> 00:58:23.333
we departed and some of us could try to find a
crew. Also, we left the cart behind.

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:27.497
LAURA: And my mom and our puppy.

00:58:27.497 --> 00:58:33.237
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could return to somewhere else
along the-- Nicodranas or Port Damali.

00:58:33.237 --> 00:58:36.522
MARISHA: Maybe we should talk about the whole
Nicodranas thing really fast?

00:58:36.522 --> 00:58:40.302
MATT: As you guys are having this moment of
conversation, you can't help but notice in the

00:58:40.302 --> 00:58:47.943
middle of this talk, quiet off to the side--
Yasha's just on the outskirts of you, holding onto

00:58:47.943 --> 00:58:52.584
the rope of the sail. She hasn't tied it down yet,
she's just using herself to hold and maneuver the

00:58:52.584 --> 00:58:59.546
sail because that's all she knows. But there is,
on the far end on the port bow of the ship, is

00:58:59.546 --> 00:59:04.334
still Caduceus, legs curled up to the chest
looking out over the ocean.

00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:08.471
LAURA: We should definitely talk about it.

00:59:08.471 --> 00:59:12.539
TRAVIS: I didn't mean for that to go the way it
did.

00:59:12.539 --> 00:59:22.018
MARISHA: I don't think any of us did. Can we return
back to your hometown ever again after that?

00:59:22.039 --> 00:59:23.952
LAURA: That is a really good question.

00:59:23.952 --> 00:59:26.596
MARISHA: I feel like we might need to drop some--

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:32.182
LAURA: Stealing comes with a pretty hefty fine. So
does killing people.

00:59:32.182 --> 00:59:36.941
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's not looking good for us right
now.

00:59:36.941 --> 00:59:44.054
MARISHA: Also we have a couple of members of the
Mighty Nein that seem a little bit disparate.

00:59:44.054 --> 00:59:47.233
LAURA: I walk over to Caduceus.

00:59:47.233 --> 00:59:49.914
MARISHA: I'll join.

00:59:49.914 --> 00:59:54.090
LAURA: Um, hello?

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.095
TALIESIN: Hey.

00:59:56.095 --> 01:00:00.932
LAURA: I sit down cross-legged in front of him.

01:00:00.932 --> 01:00:08.423
MARISHA: I maneuver to the other side but sit
leaning up against the ship, out of it, but here.

01:00:08.423 --> 01:00:11.657
LIAM: (whispers) Saved by the Bell style.

01:00:11.657 --> 01:00:14.312
LAURA: How are you?

01:00:14.312 --> 01:00:20.592
TALIESIN: I think it's been a day.

01:00:20.592 --> 01:00:23.532
LAURA: It has.

01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:26.621
TALIESIN: Miss Jester, do you have a plan?

01:00:26.621 --> 01:00:38.851
LAURA: Hmm.. Wow, no. I don't think I ever have
had a plan.

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:45.485
TALIESIN: I did. I do-- I did-- I don't know.

01:00:45.485 --> 01:00:47.389
LAURA: What is your plan?

01:00:47.389 --> 01:01:14.050
TALIESIN: (sighs) I... had a mission, a holy
purpose, a thing that defined me, and I thought

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:32.232
that I was honoring it, and now-- what if I was
wrong? This is not what I thought it was going to be.

01:01:32.743 --> 01:01:34.628
LAURA: What was your mission?

01:01:34.628 --> 01:01:57.389
TALIESIN: My home is dying and... I thought this
was what I was supposed to do. I waited for a sign

01:01:57.389 --> 01:02:06.807
and I thought you were the sign, and now maybe
there wasn't any sign. Maybe I just left, and I'm

01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:19.302
on a ship in an ocean that doesn't want me here.
It's been so quiet, and--

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:24.475
LAURA: Like how? Do you sometimes hear things?

01:02:24.475 --> 01:02:30.171
TALIESIN: I always hear things. What if I made a
mistake?

01:02:30.171 --> 01:02:32.123
LIAM: I wander over.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:45.689
LAURA: Well. A lot of times I think that maybe the
Traveler has left me and I think maybe things are

01:02:45.689 --> 01:02:57.567
going poorly and he doesn't like me anymore, but
sometimes he'll just show up after a while and

01:02:57.567 --> 01:03:03.820
tell me that I was on the right path all along,
and he just made it fun for me to find it again.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:09.411
TALIESIN: And one day will be the last time; what
then?

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:13.468
LAURA: You're not afraid of death, are you?

01:03:13.468 --> 01:03:28.945
TALIESIN: No. Although dying was-- I've been hurt
before and I've-- almost drowning was a lot.

01:03:29.192 --> 01:03:39.280
(laugh) That was a lot and the ocean is a lot and
this is a lot.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.536
LAURA: Breathe.

01:03:41.536 --> 01:03:45.057
TALIESIN: (deep breathing)

01:03:45.057 --> 01:03:51.080
LAURA: The world is a lot bigger than your
cemetery. There are a lot of things for you to

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.609
see, and you have to break out of your comfort
zone in order to find the path that you are

01:03:53.609 --> 01:03:59.304
looking for.

01:03:59.304 --> 01:04:10.378
TALIESIN: I think I needed to hear that.
Breathing's hard. (breathing)

01:04:10.378 --> 01:04:13.712
LAURA: Just keep doing that.

01:04:13.712 --> 01:04:19.792
TALIESIN: (deep breathing) It smells really weird
in here.

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:22.461
LAURA: You can't smell dead people when you're on
the ocean.

01:04:22.461 --> 01:04:24.681
TALIESIN: It's very salty.

01:04:24.681 --> 01:04:26.550
LAURA: Yeah.

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:27.901
TALIESIN: Are you hungry?

01:04:27.901 --> 01:04:28.572
LAURA: Yes.

01:04:28.572 --> 01:04:31.139
TALIESIN: I'm really hungry.

01:04:31.139 --> 01:04:34.383
LAURA: Do you want to make some food? We have a
lot downstairs: two weeks' worth.

01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:36.355
TALIESIN: I like cooking. I think I need to cook.

01:04:36.355 --> 01:04:37.382
LAURA: Let's go.

01:04:37.382 --> 01:04:48.207
TALIESIN: Let's go cook. Really, I feel better, that
was actually really nice. I'm going to go cook.

01:04:48.707 --> 01:05:01.450
MARISHA: As they walk away and since Caleb
wandered up-- Do you truly believe the amount of

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:03.753
justification you were just doing for our
actions?

01:05:03.753 --> 01:05:10.239
LIAM: What do you mean, that they started it?

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:23.070
MARISHA: Everything we just did. Definitely had a
long string of-- sounded like convincing yourself

01:05:23.374 --> 01:05:31.452
and maybe the rest of us and I just wondered how
much you actually believed it, or how much you're

01:05:31.452 --> 01:05:36.343
trying to convince yourself that you didn't fuck
up real bad.

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:38.038
LIAM: No, I'm good.

01:05:38.038 --> 01:05:40.095
MARISHA: Okay, that's great.

01:05:40.095 --> 01:05:49.204
LIAM: Today was not optimal by any means, but we
have helped our friend's mother and she is better

01:05:49.204 --> 01:06:00.515
off. The things on the dock did not go great-- no
one would use the word great-- but we did not draw

01:06:00.515 --> 01:06:05.266
a blade on them or do anything, they attacked us.
We kept ourselves alive, we kept our friends

01:06:05.266 --> 01:06:11.081
alive. I did not expect us to be departing
Jester's hometown quite so quickly, but here we

01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:24.778
are. We're all alive, we're helping another one of
our friends. This is not our home.

01:06:24.778 --> 01:06:29.133
MARISHA: It's not our home, but does that give us
the right to shit on everyone else's?

01:06:29.133 --> 01:06:31.700
LIAM: I would not say that we have shit on
everyone else's.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:43.966
MARISHA: All right. Okay. I don't know. I'm not
looking for answers--

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:49.097
LIAM: Which part specifically troubles you most?
Is it the fact that the town might be without

01:06:49.097 --> 01:06:50.968
power for a little bit?

01:06:50.968 --> 01:06:52.252
MARISHA: Eh, people can adapt.

01:06:52.252 --> 01:07:01.072
LIAM: They can adapt. They have to adapt. People
have to adapt. And that creature down there, he's

01:07:01.072 --> 01:07:07.707
doing better. You can't have a society built on
slavery.

01:07:07.707 --> 01:07:17.372
MARISHA: It's just that-- I've done a lot of
shitty things and I've made a lot of shitty

01:07:17.372 --> 01:07:27.173
choices and a lot of mistakes, and after Molly, I
told myself that I was going to try and not do

01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:31.812
that as much, but it's fucking hard.

01:07:31.885 --> 01:07:37.548
LIAM: Well, there were a lot of innocent people in
that death hole and they're alive because of you.

01:07:37.548 --> 01:07:44.860
Jester's mother is better off because of you.
Alfield is better because of you-- you have done a

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.635
lot of good.

01:07:47.635 --> 01:07:52.356
MARISHA: Can we justify murdering six people to
have Jester's mom be a little bit better off?

01:07:52.356 --> 01:07:55.522
LIAM: Well, they attacked us.

01:07:55.522 --> 01:08:01.887
MARISHA: Okay, yep. They attacked us. And I walk
away.

01:08:02.019 --> 01:08:07.080
TRAVIS: I'll call out to Beau as she's walking
off.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.638
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:08:08.638 --> 01:08:12.937
TRAVIS: How's it looking down there? Spirits
high?

01:08:12.937 --> 01:08:15.756
(laughter)

01:08:15.756 --> 01:08:18.766
MARISHA: Uh...

01:08:18.766 --> 01:08:25.252
TRAVIS: Okay, no-- I thought I'd ask. How are you
feeling?

01:08:25.252 --> 01:08:29.614
MARISHA: Conflicted, I guess.

01:08:29.614 --> 01:08:31.170
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't feel very good.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:44.608
MARISHA: I don't know. Look, I know we reacted
accordingly and in self-defense, but we probably

01:08:44.608 --> 01:08:47.142
could have a been a little bit smarter about that
entire situation.

01:08:47.142 --> 01:08:49.127
TRAVIS: It's been a day, right?

01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:51.185
MARISHA: It's been a fucking day!

01:08:51.185 --> 01:08:54.818
TRAVIS: We were going to talk to Algar, we ended
up killing his bodyguards and setting that thing

01:08:54.818 --> 01:08:58.238
free, and then we were going to go and talk to
Marius and then we ended up killing the whole

01:08:58.238 --> 01:09:01.173
fucking crew and captain, minus one.

01:09:01.173 --> 01:09:11.814
MARISHA: In a part of myself, I'm a little mad
because-- I don't know. Everything that tortle was

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:19.413
telling us about Marius and how he hangs out at
the docks and waits until midnight and I'm like,

01:09:19.413 --> 01:09:27.760
(scoffs) "What a random, fun guy, just hanging out
by the docks at mid--" I don't know, everything

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.746
about that should have connected in my brain
that--

01:09:30.746 --> 01:09:38.779
TRAVIS: Why didn't we just go talk? I feel like
we've abandoned the use of-- here's my thing,

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:47.147
right? Magic's new to me, this sword is new to me.
I didn't have most of this all of my life. All I

01:09:47.147 --> 01:09:53.230
had was my words to get out of situations, to try
and heal conflict, to try and outsmart somebody.

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:59.560
Now, all of a sudden, I have this power and I feel
like it's a shortcut and that I've been cheating

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:06.050
myself. I don't feel like I've put forth the same
effort to resolve something because I can just

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:09.645
will something into happening. That doesn't seem
right to me.

01:10:09.645 --> 01:10:19.397
MARISHA: In a fucked up way, I can actually relate
to that quite a lot. For me, I've always had my

01:10:19.397 --> 01:10:24.699
fists, and, man, is it way easier to solve
problems when you're beating the shit out of

01:10:24.699 --> 01:10:26.352
somebody.

01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:32.648
TRAVIS: How does Caleb feel about all this?

01:10:32.648 --> 01:10:35.171
MARISHA: Like we were justified in our actions.

01:10:35.171 --> 01:10:37.739
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

01:10:37.739 --> 01:10:39.356
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:10:39.356 --> 01:10:45.423
TRAVIS: I don't know, just doesn't sit right.
How's Caduceus?

01:10:45.423 --> 01:10:53.029
MARISHA: Jester had a good talk with him; I think
he'll actually be okay. We might need to do a

01:10:53.029 --> 01:11:04.416
little bit more maintenance. I feel bad; I've
treated people like shit my whole life. And having

01:11:04.416 --> 01:11:09.472
one transformative moment doesn't mean that you're
immediately going to be a different person

01:11:09.472 --> 01:11:14.095
overnight and being better is something you have
to work at, I guess.

01:11:14.095 --> 01:11:16.591
TRAVIS: That was actually very profound.

01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:29.446
MARISHA: I can understand taking the easy way out
with the power that you have. It's what I've done

01:11:29.446 --> 01:11:36.210
my whole life. I just don't know anything else,
though.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:45.931
TRAVIS: I get that. Maybe we try not to do that. I
check you, you check me. We check the group.

01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:53.126
Otherwise, I feel like Caduceus is not going to be
the last person that thinks about--

01:11:53.126 --> 01:11:54.975
MARISHA: Walks away from us.

01:11:54.975 --> 01:11:56.118
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:11:56.118 --> 01:12:06.098
MARISHA: I've driven most people in my life away
from me. Hearing him talk like that, it's not the

01:12:06.098 --> 01:12:14.958
first time I've heard those things, and I don't
want to drive you guys away. I don't want us to

01:12:14.958 --> 01:12:20.333
drive each other away. (sighs) Anyway.

01:12:20.515 --> 01:12:27.931
TRAVIS: We need to decide on a destination,
whether we turn around and-- Were we in the Open

01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:30.107
Quay or were we in the Wayfarer's...?

01:12:30.107 --> 01:12:32.769
MATT: No, that was in the Wharf.

01:12:32.769 --> 01:12:34.430
TRAVIS: We're in the Wharf.

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:36.643
MATT: Yeah, The Restless Wharf.

01:12:36.643 --> 01:12:40.294
TRAVIS: The Restless Wharf. We can turn around and
come back to the Open Quay or where the

01:12:40.294 --> 01:12:47.642
Wharfmaster was and try and get in and out real
fast with some crew, or we can head to Port

01:12:47.642 --> 01:12:50.894
Damali, or we can head out to the open sea, but we
do need to pick a destination.

01:12:50.894 --> 01:13:00.181
MARISHA: Is there any damage-- whoever's there! Is
there any damage control we want to consider in

01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:04.235
Nicodranas before we fuck off forever?

01:13:04.235 --> 01:13:05.858
SAM: Damage control?

01:13:05.858 --> 01:13:07.749
LIAM: Well, we can't leave without a crew.

01:13:07.749 --> 01:13:09.421
SAM: We can send a letter.

01:13:09.421 --> 01:13:15.140
MATT: Which, as a note, you would know there are a
few different positions that probably need to be

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:20.035
filled. There definitely needs to be a captain,
there needs to be a navigator, there needs to be a

01:13:20.035 --> 01:13:25.468
quartermaster-- who is essentially the first mate
that is the second in command under the captain

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:31.656
and handles all of the elements there. You're
going to need some form of a cook, someone that

01:13:31.656 --> 01:13:33.887
handles and prepares food. You're probably going
to need a bosun.

01:13:33.887 --> 01:13:35.861
TRAVIS: Caduceus. Oh, bosun--

01:13:35.861 --> 01:13:40.975
MATT: Bosun handles the upkeep on the ropes and
the sails and general deck upkeep.

01:13:40.975 --> 01:13:45.735
SAM: Cruise director, bursar, bartender.

01:13:45.735 --> 01:13:47.125
MARISHA: Stand-up comic.

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:48.635
SAM: I've seen The Love Boat.

01:13:48.635 --> 01:13:52.736
MATT: There is the carpenter below. Carpenter does
ship repairs and upkeep as well. Barrel-keepers

01:13:52.736 --> 01:13:57.670
are those that maintain the barrels of supplies.
There's a bunch of different-- you don't need all

01:13:57.670 --> 01:13:59.554
of these necessarily--

01:13:59.554 --> 01:14:01.306
TRAVIS: We don't have any guns? There's not guns
or powder--

01:14:01.306 --> 01:14:03.652
MATT: No, this is made for speed. Not that you've
noticed, at least.

01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:05.600
MARISHA: This has turned into a resource
management game.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.739
TALIESIN: I live for that shit.

01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:09.500
MARISHA: Lemonade Tycoon!

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:13.502
MATT: You do see Yasha, who's still holding the
rope but staring off to the south.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:19.047
LIAM: This works out for you, you were going to
get a boat.

01:14:19.047 --> 01:14:21.736
MATT: "That's fine, I guess."

01:14:21.736 --> 01:14:23.998
LIAM: Know where you want to go?

01:14:23.998 --> 01:14:30.429
MATT: She looks back at you and back at the south
and says, "Just looking for a storm."

01:14:30.489 --> 01:14:33.400
MARISHA: Oh.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:39.633
SAM: Fjord, should we have a quick ship's
meeting?

01:14:39.633 --> 01:14:41.266
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:14:41.266 --> 01:14:43.332
SAM: Okay, crew meeting, everyone!

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.995
MATT: You guys, at this point, have gone down and
you've been introduced to the wonders of hardtack!

01:14:45.995 --> 01:14:52.893
Which is a lot of, essentially, hefty crackers.
Shitty, shitty crackers.

01:14:52.893 --> 01:14:54.780
TALIESIN: I've got plans.

01:14:54.780 --> 01:15:00.275
MATT: You do find a couple of barrels of fresh,
tropical fruit, which is new for you, Caduceus,

01:15:00.275 --> 01:15:04.591
especially. Short-term travel elements there.

01:15:04.591 --> 01:15:06.239
LAURA: That's good for scurvy.

01:15:06.239 --> 01:15:10.247
TALIESIN: How well stocked is this kitchen? Is it
stocked at all?

01:15:10.247 --> 01:15:16.030
MATT: It's stocked at the necessary level for a
two-week journey.

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:21.065
TALIESIN: Okay, I've got the stuff in my set as
well so I'm going to just--

01:15:21.065 --> 01:15:25.611
MATT: Oh yeah, you have everything on you to
create and evoke all sorts of unique flavors.

01:15:25.611 --> 01:15:28.235
TALIESIN: We're doing some shit. This is on.

01:15:28.735 --> 01:15:31.683
MATT: Are you calling everybody from the crew
together? You are in the process of planning it

01:15:31.683 --> 01:15:36.592
out and you're taking stock of everything you have
at your disposal and you hear Fjord up top calling

01:15:36.592 --> 01:15:38.303
you guys.

01:15:38.303 --> 01:15:41.989
TALIESIN: You know that spicy fruit you can buy on
the side of the road? We're doing spicy fruit.

01:15:41.989 --> 01:15:44.215
LAURA: That sounds so lovely!

01:15:44.215 --> 01:15:46.712
TALIESIN: That sounds so good right now. I'm
genuinely fiending for it.

01:15:46.712 --> 01:15:48.983
LAURA: Should we go up for the meeting and then
come back down?

01:15:48.983 --> 01:15:51.364
TALIESIN: I think we can bring the bowls up. It
doesn't take that long.

01:15:51.364 --> 01:15:54.122
LAURA: Oh sweet! We'll bring up and give people
food while we have our meeting.

01:15:54.122 --> 01:15:56.445
SAM: All right.

01:15:56.445 --> 01:15:59.830
TALIESIN: There's bowls. Mine, mine, mine.

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:01.495
SAM: Thank you.

01:16:01.495 --> 01:16:03.736
LIAM: These crackers are terrible.

01:16:03.736 --> 01:16:06.344
LAURA: Spicy fruit! It's spicy fruit.

01:16:06.344 --> 01:16:09.379
LIAM: That's why it's a bad cracker.

01:16:09.379 --> 01:16:16.045
TRAVIS: Caduceus, thank you for making all this.
We need to decide on a destination. We're going to

01:16:16.045 --> 01:16:20.012
need more hands that are able to figure out where
we are going next.

01:16:20.012 --> 01:16:24.229
SAM: To get more hands, we could either go back to
the place that we exploded and murdered.

01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:29.021
TRAVIS: Not those docks. We could go to a separate
landing site.

01:16:29.021 --> 01:16:32.316
SAM: And risk being spotted by the coast guard.

01:16:32.517 --> 01:16:33.751
LAURA: Super disguised.

01:16:33.751 --> 01:16:37.837
LIAM: Who here cannot change their appearance?
You? That's it.

01:16:37.837 --> 01:16:41.773
SAM: We can't change the boat's appearance.

01:16:41.773 --> 01:16:47.116
MATT: Yasha is listening out of the corner of her
ear and raises her hand and looks back.

01:16:47.116 --> 01:16:48.816
LIAM: Okay. You've got the boat.

01:16:48.816 --> 01:16:51.934
SAM: Or we could go further to--

01:16:51.934 --> 01:16:54.137
TRAVIS: Port Damali.

01:16:54.137 --> 01:16:58.455
SAM: Port Damali, or some other place on the coast
that I don't know. Or this other place, this

01:16:58.455 --> 01:17:00.710
island that's like 300 miles away.

01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:04.916
LAURA: Port Damali's all the way up at the top. We
could just stop at the next city up.

01:17:04.916 --> 01:17:06.633
SAM: What's the next city up?

01:17:06.633 --> 01:17:08.886
MATT: Next city up would be Port Zoon.

01:17:08.886 --> 01:17:10.668
LAURA: Port Zoon.

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:15.146
MATT: That's about a three-day travel to get
there.

01:17:15.191 --> 01:17:17.980
LAURA: That is a lot of time, though, to get
there.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.478
LIAM: We would be exhausted.

01:17:19.478 --> 01:17:24.358
TRAVIS: We could turn around and try to go to
the-- Where was the wharfmaster? The dwarf. Ingus?

01:17:24.358 --> 01:17:28.321
MATT: I think it was Ignus.

01:17:28.321 --> 01:17:30.075
TRAVIS: Ignus.

01:17:30.075 --> 01:17:35.180
LAURA: Are we seriously considering bringing the
ship right back to Nicodranas?

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.046
TRAVIS: It's a different section of the city.

01:17:37.434 --> 01:17:40.252
SAM: Do we have a lifeboat or any sort of buoy or
anything?

01:17:40.252 --> 01:17:41.954
MARISHA: Yes, lifeboat. Is there a--

01:17:41.954 --> 01:17:49.944
MATT: There's not a lifeboat, per se. There is a
small row skiff.

01:17:49.944 --> 01:17:54.514
LIAM: What about pulling into a cove outside of
the city a couple of miles and walking in?

01:17:54.514 --> 01:17:57.785
MARISHA: Or we could just leave the boat out in
the ocean a little bit and take the skiff in.

01:17:57.785 --> 01:18:01.746
SAM: Are we hiring a crew? Are we kidnapping a
crew?

01:18:01.746 --> 01:18:03.765
TRAVIS: Hiring a crew.

01:18:03.765 --> 01:18:05.397
SAM: Do we have enough money?

01:18:05.397 --> 01:18:08.016
TRAVIS: Fuck. I don't know.

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:12.253
MATT: You've not hired a crew before. You just
know what you've worked for which is not a lot.

01:18:12.253 --> 01:18:14.254
LAURA: How much did you make when you were--

01:18:14.254 --> 01:18:15.386
TRAVIS: Not a ton.

01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:17.509
MATT: It's maybe, depending on the job, two, three
gold a day.

01:18:17.519 --> 01:18:19.457
MARISHA and SAM: Okay.

01:18:19.499 --> 01:18:20.869
SAM: We have enough gold.

01:18:20.869 --> 01:18:25.456
TRAVIS: Our quickest bet is just to turn back
into-- What area was the wharfmaster Ignus in?

01:18:25.456 --> 01:18:29.410
MATT: Ignus was in the Restless Wharf.

01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:31.500
TRAVIS: It was the Restless Wharf.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:36.081
LAURA: I guess I could maybe-- can I try to cast
Mending on the sail and see if it looks like the

01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:38.642
burn damage goes away?

01:18:38.642 --> 01:18:44.724
MATT: Yeah. I'll say you can slowly, over time
focus-- It'll take you about a good hour or so,

01:18:44.724 --> 01:18:48.399
but you could eventually get the sail to be
unsinged.

01:18:48.399 --> 01:18:53.477
LAURA: Maybe I can paint something on the sail so
it looks like a different boat.

01:18:53.477 --> 01:18:55.069
SAM: Ooh yes.

01:18:55.069 --> 01:18:58.904
LIAM: We can either pull the name off of the boat
or alter it.

01:18:58.904 --> 01:19:00.501
MARISHA and LIAM: The Mistake.

01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:02.933
MARISHA: Super into it.

01:19:02.933 --> 01:19:04.362
LIAM: I am, too.

01:19:04.362 --> 01:19:11.415
MARISHA: I have a thought. There was something we
used to do and sometimes I'd get hired to do in my

01:19:11.415 --> 01:19:16.015
town. A little bit of subterfuge. If we wanted to
try and--

01:19:16.015 --> 01:19:19.678
TRAVIS: That's gone real well for us in the past
24 hours, but go ahead.

01:19:19.678 --> 01:19:23.307
MARISHA: Well, this one's a little bit more under
the surface.

01:19:23.307 --> 01:19:27.200
LIAM: Quiet subterfuge instead of loud subterfuge
which is what we've been doing.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:33.966
MARISHA: In fact, quiet is the key. We used to do
little whisper campaigns.

01:19:33.966 --> 01:19:36.435
SAM: How so?

01:19:36.435 --> 01:19:45.619
MARISHA: Just going into bars, pubs. Start talking
a little bit loudly about the pirate crew and

01:19:45.619 --> 01:19:52.931
Captain Jawgrasp and the hell that he unleashed on
the docks the other night.

01:19:52.931 --> 01:19:57.836
SAM: Oh. Disparage the dead's name so that when
people--

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.123
MARISHA: Fuck it, he's dead. Yeah.

01:19:59.123 --> 01:20:03.420
SAM: And then when anyone finds out that we did
it they'll be like, "Good for them for killing those

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.210
"bastards," right?

01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:07.280
MARISHA: I don't even think we'd throw our name in
the mix.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.811
LAURA: We don't ever mention ourselves.

01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:11.517
MARISHA: Never mention ourselves, just--

01:20:11.517 --> 01:20:15.918
LIAM: Maybe the crew turned on their captain and
killed him on the docks and fled with his ship, <i>ja</i>.

01:20:16.481 --> 01:20:23.843
MARISHA: Build a narrative. Start talking just a
little bit louder than what you should in public.

01:20:23.843 --> 01:20:27.126
Maybe whispering to some bartenders.

01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:28.853
SAM: Seems like it would take days.

01:20:28.853 --> 01:20:30.864
TRAVIS: Yeah, could you do this in a night?

01:20:30.864 --> 01:20:34.501
MARISHA: Well, my thought was if we split up a
little bit, you guys focus on hiring a crew,

01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:37.142
someone else focus on spreading some words.

01:20:37.142 --> 01:20:40.090
LAURA: We could just sleep before all this stuff
happens because damn!

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:46.750
TRAVIS: Sure. Although the more time that passes,
the longer word has to spread.

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:49.894
LAURA: It probably has already spread.

01:20:49.894 --> 01:20:53.774
SAM: Well, it's the middle of the night now, so
it's not going to spread till morning. Right?

01:20:53.774 --> 01:20:58.725
MATT: It's about this point you look over in the
horizon and you can see the faint hint of dark

01:20:58.725 --> 01:21:00.869
blue turning to lighter blue.

01:21:00.869 --> 01:21:03.527
LAURA: Can we just sleep? I'm so tired.

01:21:03.527 --> 01:21:07.189
SAM: Let's take a nap. We'll just coast here. Can
we coast? Do we have an anchor? Can we anchor?

01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:10.772
TRAVIS: We're a little deep for an anchor.

01:21:10.772 --> 01:21:13.446
SAM: Can we just do doughnuts?

01:21:13.446 --> 01:21:18.145
LAURA: Can we go to sleep even if we're just
sailing around?

01:21:18.145 --> 01:21:27.235
TRAVIS: Sure. Let's go in circles. 12 miles off
coast, we'll just go in circles.

01:21:27.377 --> 01:21:31.171
LIAM: Fjord, can the boat just be adrift if a
couple of us stay up in shifts to make sure that

01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:32.420
there are no enemies?

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.652
TRAVIS: In shifts, you can navigate in a pattern,
yeah.

01:21:34.652 --> 01:21:37.698
MARISHA: Can we slowly in shifts navigate towards
a cove?

01:21:37.698 --> 01:21:40.200
LIAM: None of us know how to steer this thing
except for Fjord.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.576
MARISHA: Fuck me.

01:21:43.576 --> 01:21:45.585
LIAM: I think we just need to cool it.

01:21:45.605 --> 01:21:54.518
MATT: You can very faintly see towards the horizon
where Nicodranas is, the occasional little soft

01:21:54.735 --> 01:22:00.721
light of the lighthouse. You're not completely out
of sight of it and when it's this dark and you pay

01:22:00.721 --> 01:22:03.630
attention, you can just barely see that little
blip of light.

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:05.288
LAURA: They're going to see us.

01:22:05.288 --> 01:22:07.112
SAM: We don't have any light on here.

01:22:07.112 --> 01:22:08.862
MATT: Yeah, there's no light on the ship.

01:22:08.862 --> 01:22:10.711
LAURA: They'll see us when it gets lighter.

01:22:10.711 --> 01:22:13.005
SAM: We're fine.

01:22:13.005 --> 01:22:15.913
LAURA: I'm going to go sleep, okay bye.

01:22:15.913 --> 01:22:22.334
SAM: The plan is we're going to find a cove and
hide the ship, sneak in, get some crew, sneak

01:22:22.334 --> 01:22:32.161
back. Or, we're just going to sail right into a
different port also in Nicodranas? Grab a crew

01:22:32.161 --> 01:22:36.097
while we start a whisper campaign, and bolt?

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:40.801
TRAVIS: Yes. I don't know. Either one of those is
fine.

01:22:40.801 --> 01:22:42.624
MARISHA: Sounds insane.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:49.997
TRAVIS: Yeah. I vote for sailing up outside of the
wharfmaster area, taking a little skiff in, just

01:22:49.997 --> 01:22:52.289
getting some crew and getting the fuck out of
here.

01:22:52.289 --> 01:22:54.818
MARISHA: We can always pull in the ship really
fast to load on the crew and then peace out?

01:22:55.141 --> 01:23:01.984
TRAVIS: I'd keep the ship out of there just in
case the Zello, the Jello.

01:23:01.984 --> 01:23:03.179
MATT: Zhelezo.

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:06.077
TRAVIS: Zhelezo have come up and said (exaggerated
accent) "There was a ship and the Fireball

01:23:06.077 --> 01:23:09.285
"detonated on the side of it and ours has a bunch
of burn damage."

01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:10.778
LIAM: Why are you talking so funny?

01:23:10.778 --> 01:23:13.560
TRAVIS: I don't-- The splinters are in my
forehead.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:19.172
MARISHA: Let's sleep. So tired.

01:23:19.213 --> 01:23:21.540
LIAM: Sit up with me for a little bit. We'll take
the first shift.

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.125
SAM: Are you talking to me or--

01:23:23.125 --> 01:23:24.674
LIAM: You. Nott the Brave.

01:23:24.724 --> 01:23:28.026
LAURA and TALIESIN: Good night.

01:23:28.324 --> 01:23:34.933
MATT: All right. You guys take shifts throughout
the evening. To the early elements of the morning.

01:23:35.102 --> 01:23:38.757
LIAM: Yeah, late morning. Can I just take a moment
with my goblin friend while they're sleeping?

01:23:38.757 --> 01:23:39.779
MATT: Sure.

01:23:39.779 --> 01:23:40.913
LIAM: Come here, look. I want to show you
something.

01:23:41.064 --> 01:23:42.502
SAM: What?

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:43.810
LIAM: You want a piggyback?

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.442
SAM: Yes.

01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:47.118
LIAM: Skitter up.

01:23:47.118 --> 01:23:48.190
SAM: (skittering)

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:51.361
LIAM: You see the sun is coming up, but you can
still see one or two up there. You see that one?

01:23:51.361 --> 01:23:53.009
SAM: The stars?

01:23:53.009 --> 01:23:55.499
LIAM: That's a planet, that one. That's another
place.

01:23:55.499 --> 01:23:57.475
SAM: No, we're on the planet.

01:23:57.475 --> 01:23:59.606
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes.

01:23:59.606 --> 01:24:07.016
LIAM: Today was a major clusterfuck. Everything
went wrong. We did all the wrong things.

01:24:07.016 --> 01:24:10.554
SAM: It didn't feel very good, did it?

01:24:10.554 --> 01:24:17.288
LIAM: No. But do you know what worries me more is
the feelings I'm getting from everyone in the

01:24:17.288 --> 01:24:21.219
crew. They're a little despondent. All of them.

01:24:21.219 --> 01:24:24.043
SAM: What do we do about that?

01:24:24.043 --> 01:24:33.046
LIAM: I know that it didn't go very well, but,
this is our new family, right? We want the family

01:24:33.046 --> 01:24:37.837
to stick together. I think we need to-- oh you're
over here. I think we need to lead by example.

01:24:37.837 --> 01:24:43.014
SAM: You mean just laugh extra hard and pretend
like we're having a great time?

01:24:43.014 --> 01:24:51.192
LIAM: Keep their morale up, I think, is all I
mean. We have done good things, I know that the

01:24:51.192 --> 01:24:58.558
day was-- it was a day. But we want this to keep
going.

01:24:58.558 --> 01:25:00.052
SAM: Yes.

01:25:00.052 --> 01:25:01.950
LIAM: We care for these people, <i>ja</i>?

01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:08.211
SAM: Absolutely. And we want to stay together, and
if they're thinking that this is not working out,

01:25:08.211 --> 01:25:14.554
we have to do something to change that. I don't
know about going in and starting to lie to a bunch

01:25:14.554 --> 01:25:16.822
of people. Is that going to make them--

01:25:16.822 --> 01:25:22.329
LIAM: We definitely need to think more than just
wing it, you know? This group, we get under each

01:25:22.329 --> 01:25:26.541
others' skin, and we all egg each other on and we
like to wing it, so maybe we need to slow things

01:25:26.541 --> 01:25:32.309
down. But I am serious, the thing that I am
worried most is they feel like it's fracturing,

01:25:32.309 --> 01:25:36.528
and we cannot let that happen.

01:25:36.528 --> 01:25:42.245
SAM: All right. I'll start thinking about what we
can do.

01:25:42.245 --> 01:25:50.924
LIAM: Also, are you mad about the swimming thing?

01:25:50.924 --> 01:25:58.428
SAM: Oh, no, you did what you had to do! I needed
to be with the group, otherwise I would've been

01:25:58.428 --> 01:26:04.773
stranded there alone, and that wouldn't have been
good. Next time, you can just tell me, though.

01:26:04.773 --> 01:26:09.254
LIAM: Tell you when I'm going to mess with your
head a little bit?

01:26:09.254 --> 01:26:11.388
SAM: Yeah, it's all right. I need it.

01:26:11.388 --> 01:26:13.662
LIAM: I thought it would help.

01:26:13.662 --> 01:26:21.198
SAM: It did, temporarily. I'm still very scared of
the water, and I like being on the boat, but

01:26:21.198 --> 01:26:34.116
getting off is going to be a trick. But it's all
right. Yeah. Yeah, we're cool. It's just these

01:26:34.116 --> 01:26:35.831
other people that're all messed up.

01:26:35.831 --> 01:26:37.838
LIAM: (whispering) They're losing their cool.

01:26:37.838 --> 01:26:47.119
SAM: I know. We'll keep them together. If all else
fails, fake a heart attack. Everyone will go to

01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:51.461
your aid, and then when they save you, we'll be
like, "Yeah, we saved him, yeah!"

01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:55.568
LIAM: I don't know if you're joking or not, but
I'm going to do it.

01:26:55.568 --> 01:26:57.125
SAM: Okay, good.

01:26:57.125 --> 01:26:59.308
LIAM: And there really is another world.

01:26:59.308 --> 01:27:01.004
SAM: No, we're on the world.

01:27:01.004 --> 01:27:03.195
LIAM: Fine.

01:27:03.195 --> 01:27:13.681
MATT: Nott is a One Earther. All right, you guys
keeping first watch, make a perception check.

01:27:13.681 --> 01:27:17.220
Whoever's maintaining that, either advantage or
you both roll independently.

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:18.614
SAM and LIAM: Independently.

01:27:18.614 --> 01:27:19.949
SAM: 14.

01:27:19.949 --> 01:27:21.988
LIAM: It's a perception? 22.

01:27:21.988 --> 01:27:27.976
MATT: Keeping an eye out, you begin to watch as
multiple ships begin to cruise out from

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:33.512
Nicodranas. At first you begin to get nervous, but
watching them, you can see it's the early morning.

01:27:33.512 --> 01:27:39.835
Right as dawn hits, a lot of these fisherman ships
start going out and finding sections where lots of

01:27:39.835 --> 01:27:46.110
schools tend to come to feed. Beyond that, you
don't see any encroaching danger.

01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:54.166
SAM: Are there any distinct flags or colors
hanging from our rigging?

01:27:54.166 --> 01:28:03.429
MATT: You have sails. There is a flag that sits at the
top of the main mast, but it is currently tied up.

01:28:03.454 --> 01:28:08.331
SAM: Okay. Can I skitter up there and see what it
is if it were to unfurl?

01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:12.223
MATT: It's big, so you'd have to unfurl to see
it.

01:28:12.223 --> 01:28:14.610
SAM: Can I pull it down? Is there a thing?

01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:20.664
MATT: Yeah, you can bring it down. You bring the
flag down and open it up, and it's a light gray

01:28:20.664 --> 01:28:32.838
flag that looks almost like a curled wave. It
looks like a wave of water that curls away. That's

01:28:32.838 --> 01:28:35.527
the best you can ascertain as to what the design
means.

01:28:35.527 --> 01:28:38.332
SAM: We'll ask Fjord about it when he wakes up.

01:28:38.332 --> 01:28:43.978
MATT: You guys finish your shift. Who's taking
next shift?

01:28:43.978 --> 01:28:46.160
TRAVIS: I'll go second.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.933
MATT: Okay.

01:28:47.933 --> 01:28:50.914
SAM: On the crossover: Does this mean anything to
you?

01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:52.645
MATT: It does not.

01:28:52.645 --> 01:28:54.097
TRAVIS: It does not.

01:28:54.097 --> 01:28:57.758
SAM: Maybe we should change it. On the next
crossover, tell Jester to paint it.

01:28:57.758 --> 01:29:00.581
TRAVIS: It's going to be a giant dick and balls if
we do.

01:29:00.581 --> 01:29:01.897
SAM: That's fine.

01:29:01.897 --> 01:29:03.089
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:29:03.089 --> 01:29:08.501
MATT: Who's taking next shift? It's Fjord, and
just Fjord? Fjord and Caduceus out there for

01:29:08.501 --> 01:29:10.130
second shift.

01:29:10.130 --> 01:29:16.370
TRAVIS: How you doing?

01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:18.275
TALIESIN: I think I'm embracing the chaos.

01:29:18.275 --> 01:29:24.142
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, that's a good way to deal.

01:29:24.142 --> 01:29:26.040
TALIESIN: Do you have a plan?

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.007
TRAVIS: A plan?

01:29:28.007 --> 01:29:32.344
MARISHA: You're asking everyone. Oh no.

01:29:32.344 --> 01:29:40.072
TRAVIS: I have a series of expectations, but I
wouldn't call it a plan.

01:29:40.072 --> 01:29:44.058
TALIESIN: I don't get it, but okay.

01:29:44.058 --> 01:29:51.365
TRAVIS: I'm in pursuit of something, and I know what
maybe the next couple of steps are, but past that--

01:29:51.658 --> 01:30:01.300
TALIESIN: That's an answer. That'll do. Yesterday
was-- oh god, what's the word?

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.790
TRAVIS: Heavy?

01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:04.977
TALIESIN: Heavy. Heavy's good. Yeah.

01:30:04.977 --> 01:30:08.459
TRAVIS: I take it you haven't seen much combat.

01:30:08.459 --> 01:30:15.398
TALIESIN: Well, I've fought animals, a few
bandits.

01:30:15.398 --> 01:30:17.841
TRAVIS: You ever fought a giant water genie?

01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:20.043
TALIESIN: No. No, that was a first.

01:30:20.043 --> 01:30:23.025
TRAVIS: Me neither. Never even seen one before.

01:30:23.025 --> 01:30:28.133
TALIESIN: Is life always this directionless?

01:30:28.133 --> 01:30:37.390
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, yeah, my new life, pretty
much, yeah. It's open.

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:45.909
TALIESIN: The one with the hair, I think she's
going to take off again.

01:30:45.909 --> 01:30:48.145
TRAVIS: Yasha.

01:30:48.145 --> 01:30:49.706
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:30:49.706 --> 01:30:51.334
TRAVIS: What makes you say that?

01:30:51.334 --> 01:30:56.591
TALIESIN: Oh, you know how it is. Some rocks don't
sit right.

01:30:56.591 --> 01:31:04.972
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do you naturally have the ability to
feel that out of people?

01:31:04.972 --> 01:31:10.471
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah?

01:31:10.471 --> 01:31:12.813
TRAVIS: It's very insightful.

01:31:12.813 --> 01:31:19.907
TALIESIN: Well, my job for most of my life was to
talk to people. Well, it wasn't to talk to people;

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:23.769
it was to listen to people. I've listened to a lot
of people.

01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:26.039
TRAVIS: For your job?

01:31:26.039 --> 01:31:32.382
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's a graveyard. People come and
they talk. A lot.

01:31:32.382 --> 01:31:35.911
TRAVIS: When they're grieving?

01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:44.792
TALIESIN: Yeah, and you listen a lot. I don't know
much, but I know people. And I know things that

01:31:44.792 --> 01:31:49.230
aren't people. There's a lot more, apparently.

01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:52.429
TRAVIS: You seem to pick up on the stuff that's
not said?

01:31:52.429 --> 01:32:01.633
TALIESIN: You have to. I like that you're looking
for something. That's good.

01:32:01.633 --> 01:32:05.454
TRAVIS: Otherwise, I don't really know what I'd be
doing.

01:32:05.454 --> 01:32:11.151
TALIESIN: Well, I hope we find it, because then
you'd get to figure out what to do next, and then

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:13.639
there'll be two of us who would be wondering.

01:32:13.639 --> 01:32:18.324
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Okay.

01:32:18.324 --> 01:32:21.204
TALIESIN: I'm definitely looking out on the ocean
to see if--

01:32:21.204 --> 01:32:23.087
MATT: Yeah, perception check from each of you?

01:32:23.087 --> 01:32:24.208
TRAVIS: I'll give you advantage.

01:32:24.208 --> 01:32:29.988
TALIESIN: I'll do the double, yeah. Yeah, that's
not bad. 21.

01:32:29.988 --> 01:32:37.130
MATT: Keeping an eye out on this as well, you,
towards the end of your shift, notice one ship

01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:42.266
that isn't one of the fishermen ships or one of
the traders' ships that you've seen in the docks

01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:51.275
and pointed out to you. It is one of the Zhelezo
search ships. It's not leaving too far from the

01:32:51.275 --> 01:32:55.473
docks, but it's at least patrolling around the
outskirts.

01:32:55.473 --> 01:32:59.082
TALIESIN: Is that a sign that maybe we should
really leave?

01:32:59.082 --> 01:33:03.422
TRAVIS: I think we'll expand our travel pattern to
skate out wider.

01:33:03.422 --> 01:33:08.152
TALIESIN: Sometimes it's worth owning a mistake,
and I think yesterday was a big mistake.

01:33:08.152 --> 01:33:12.598
TRAVIS: We don't necessarily want to own that
here; they are very stern about mistakes.

01:33:12.598 --> 01:33:16.635
TALIESIN: Well, by owning it, I mean stop trying
to necessarily fix it, and let it be a mistake.

01:33:16.635 --> 01:33:19.030
TRAVIS: I agree with that.

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:20.586
TALIESIN: And maybe just--

01:33:20.586 --> 01:33:22.173
TRAVIS: Move on?

01:33:22.173 --> 01:33:24.428
TALIESIN: Admit that there might be no fixing
this.

01:33:24.428 --> 01:33:27.340
TRAVIS: I think that's wise.

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:32.604
MATT: The ship does have a wide berth. It's only
one ship that's going across the entire coast

01:33:32.604 --> 01:33:35.909
there, but that's one thing you've noticed. It's a
danger.

01:33:35.909 --> 01:33:39.209
TALIESIN: Going to have some thoughts about that
flag, too, but that's for tomorrow.

01:33:39.209 --> 01:33:47.336
MATT: Okay. You guys finish your time at watch.
The rest of you come to consciousness. It's now

01:33:47.336 --> 01:33:54.576
late morning, going to be approaching the
afternoon fairly soon, but you've woken up, some

01:33:54.576 --> 01:34:03.433
food has been devoured, your cabin mate, Gallan,
has come to consciousness, and has instinctually

01:34:03.433 --> 01:34:08.797
gone to start looking at the side of the boat and
starting to repair bits of the Fireball damage you

01:34:08.797 --> 01:34:12.487
had left. Pulls out his tools, starts going to
work on that.

01:34:12.487 --> 01:34:13.750
LIAM: That was good work.

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:15.630
LAURA: Found a carpenter!

01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:21.689
MATT: Marius is choking through some hardtack.
What do you guys want to do?

01:34:21.717 --> 01:34:26.340
SAM: We're going back? Find a cove?

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:32.709
TRAVIS: We'll make our way up to the docks where the
wharfmaster is, which is a separate docks from where--

01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:34.216
SAM: It's the same city, right?

01:34:34.216 --> 01:34:39.751
MATT: Same city. The Restless Wharf and the Open
Quay are two large sections of docks on the north end.

01:34:39.751 --> 01:34:45.216
TRAVIS: Remember it took a while to walk from one
to the other. And we're only taking the skiff in.

01:34:45.216 --> 01:34:48.823
LAURA: Plus it was dark when we left, and nobody
saw the--

01:34:48.823 --> 01:34:53.562
TRAVIS: And only people that don't look like us
can take the skiff in to get the crew that we're

01:34:53.562 --> 01:34:55.087
going to look for.

01:34:55.087 --> 01:34:57.548
LIAM: I don't know, couldn't the name of this boat
be on a ledger or something somewhere?

01:34:57.548 --> 01:34:59.383
TRAVIS: What, The Mistake?

01:34:59.383 --> 01:35:01.187
LAURA: Good thing we changed it to The Mistake.

01:35:01.187 --> 01:35:04.770
MATT: You do know that when ships check into
port-- you have not been in charge of it, but

01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:12.190
you've seen it-- usually there is a ledger of
ownership or deed of ownership to the ship that

01:35:12.190 --> 01:35:16.485
the captain presents to the wharfmaster so that
they can keep tabs on who comes in and comes out.

01:35:16.531 --> 01:35:19.011
SAM: Do we have one on this ship?

01:35:19.011 --> 01:35:20.499
MARISHA: Not for the Mistake.

01:35:20.499 --> 01:35:21.420
MATT: It got burned.

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:25.738
LAURA: (singing) Guess what I can do! I can make
things!

01:35:25.764 --> 01:35:28.031
SAM: If you've seen one before!

01:35:28.031 --> 01:35:29.841
LAURA: Fjord can tell me what they look like.

01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:31.019
TRAVIS: Can I?

01:35:31.019 --> 01:35:37.739
MATT: You can probably get the gist of it. Let's
give it a shot. You can certainly try.

01:35:37.739 --> 01:35:40.905
TRAVIS: Okay, let's try to forge a pink slip for
the Mistake.

01:35:40.905 --> 01:35:42.797
LAURA: To Fjordie?

01:35:42.797 --> 01:35:48.080
LIAM: But also, "The Mist" is printed on the side
of the boat. We have not changed that, have we?

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.716
SAM: We've got to chip that off. Carpenter! First
Mate!

01:35:50.716 --> 01:35:52.371
MATT: "Yeah?"

01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:56.802
SAM: Hold your carpentry duties for now and go
change the name of the ship.

01:35:56.802 --> 01:35:59.488
MATT: "Okay. To what?"

01:35:59.488 --> 01:36:04.228
SAM: The Mist<i>ake</i>! No one will know.

01:36:04.228 --> 01:36:05.612
MATT: "Great."

01:36:05.612 --> 01:36:08.219
SAM: In a different font.

01:36:08.219 --> 01:36:18.738
MATT: "I would love to help you, little goblin
girl. However, I can't really write or read."

01:36:19.007 --> 01:36:20.780
LAURA: Is it painted on or is it chipped on?

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:22.511
MATT: It's painted on.

01:36:22.511 --> 01:36:23.837
LAURA: I can do that!

01:36:23.837 --> 01:36:25.260
LIAM: You're an artist.

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:26.721
SAM: Back to your duties, please!

01:36:26.721 --> 01:36:28.385
MATT: "Right." He goes back to repairs.

01:36:28.385 --> 01:36:30.412
TALIESIN: Is the flag going to be a problem?

01:36:30.412 --> 01:36:32.280
LAURA: Well, we don't have to unfurl it.

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.598
TALIESIN: But will they know what the flag looks
like? Will that be part of the information that

01:36:35.598 --> 01:36:37.872
exists about the ship?

01:36:37.872 --> 01:36:39.919
TRAVIS: I am an actor in real life, you should
probably ask Matt.

01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:42.590
TALIESIN: Which is why I'm asking you and hoping
you make eye contact with the game--

01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:52.066
MATT: As far as you know, they don't check the
sails. The sails are designed to show allegiance

01:36:52.066 --> 01:36:57.975
to certain areas. If, for whatever reason, the
ship was searched and a sail was found that

01:36:57.975 --> 01:37:05.835
perhaps was known to be not kosher with the laws
of the coast, then that would be a problem. But

01:37:05.835 --> 01:37:08.315
that's only if the sail itself is--

01:37:08.315 --> 01:37:11.507
TALIESIN: But the flag, is it possible someone
might recognize the flag?

01:37:11.507 --> 01:37:15.035
MATT: It's possible. You probably wouldn't want to
go into port with the flag unfurled.

01:37:15.035 --> 01:37:17.376
TRAVIS: They don't even have to board us, because
we're going to stay out in the river. We're just

01:37:17.376 --> 01:37:18.799
taking the skiff in.

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:20.574
MARISHA: Maybe burn the flag?

01:37:20.574 --> 01:37:21.849
TALIESIN: I could dye it.

01:37:21.849 --> 01:37:23.132
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:37:23.132 --> 01:37:26.556
TRAVIS: How about we get into the docks first so
we can get some crew?

01:37:26.556 --> 01:37:30.523
LAURA: Okay. I'll rewrite the name, at least, on
the side of the ship.

01:37:30.523 --> 01:37:35.954
MATT: Okay. In order to do so, you'll have to
dangle from the actual stern of the ship.

01:37:35.954 --> 01:37:39.342
LAURA: Yasha, hold my ankles!

01:37:39.342 --> 01:37:51.624
MATT: Yasha looks confused. "Okay, I guess," and
turns you over and holds you off the side. (straining)

01:37:51.624 --> 01:37:57.707
Yasha's even having to wedge against the side because
to get you further enough down, it's about ten feet

01:37:57.733 --> 01:38:02.214
from the stern, so Yasha's having to get her foot
caught up underneath the railing.

01:38:02.214 --> 01:38:03.913
SAM: Keep doing this motion.

01:38:03.913 --> 01:38:05.247
MATT: Jeez.

01:38:05.247 --> 01:38:08.566
LAURA: I'm holding paint!

01:38:08.566 --> 01:38:10.060
SAM: Oh, this is the paint can upside-down...

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:11.510
LAURA: Yes!

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:12.815
SAM: And you're dipping?

01:38:12.815 --> 01:38:14.378
LAURA: I'm dipping because I'm hanging
upside-down!

01:38:14.378 --> 01:38:23.996
MATT: GIF of the week, right there. You manage to
write in a really extravagant, well practiced,

01:38:23.996 --> 01:38:32.053
Jester way, "The Mistake" on the back of the ship.
Yasha lifts you back on board. Any other

01:38:32.053 --> 01:38:33.575
preparations you guys want to do?

01:38:33.793 --> 01:38:35.853
LAURA: We should disguise ourselves.

01:38:35.853 --> 01:38:37.875
SAM: Should we leave anyone on the ship?

01:38:37.875 --> 01:38:41.407
MARISHA: Jester, you have a disguise kit, right?

01:38:41.407 --> 01:38:43.233
LAURA: I do.

01:38:43.233 --> 01:38:46.447
MARISHA: Would you do my makeup for me? Could you
disguise me?

01:38:46.447 --> 01:38:48.567
LAURA: Of course! Yes, of course I can.

01:38:48.567 --> 01:38:50.724
SAM: Do we need to leave someone on the ship?

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:52.206
TRAVIS: I should probably stay on the ship.

01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:54.288
SAM: No! You're the charmer! I'll stay on the
ship.

01:38:54.288 --> 01:38:56.058
MATT: Yasha goes, "I'll stay."

01:38:56.058 --> 01:38:58.198
LAURA: Yasha's going to stay on the ship.

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:01.155
TRAVIS: Do you know how to move the ship if you
need to all of a sudden?

01:39:01.155 --> 01:39:02.380
MATT: "No."

01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:06.604
TRAVIS: Then I'll stay on the ship. You guys go
on, take a big bunch of money, go get the crew.

01:39:06.604 --> 01:39:08.857
What is the argument to that?

01:39:08.857 --> 01:39:11.661
SAM: How am I going to go convince crew to work
for us?

01:39:11.661 --> 01:39:13.085
TRAVIS: You're not.

01:39:13.085 --> 01:39:15.663
SAM: Then what am I supposed to-- I have no job
out there!

01:39:15.663 --> 01:39:17.773
MARISHA: (whispering) Whisper campaign.

01:39:17.773 --> 01:39:21.760
SAM: I can do that!

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.027
TALIESIN: This is going to go so poorly.

01:39:24.027 --> 01:39:27.459
SAM: Who's going to hire a crew? We don't even
know the parts of the boat that we need to fill!

01:39:27.459 --> 01:39:29.461
You have to come with us!

01:39:29.461 --> 01:39:30.746
TRAVIS: I'll write a list.

01:39:30.746 --> 01:39:33.057
SAM: No, Yasha stays with our First Mate,
Gallan--

01:39:33.057 --> 01:39:36.669
TRAVIS: Listen, last time the only guy who could
move the ship was below deck! I'm not leaving my

01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:40.163
wingman! I'm not making this mistake a second
time!

01:39:40.163 --> 01:39:47.633
SAM: If Yasha has to move the ship, she might as
well abandon it. There's nothing she can do! She's

01:39:47.633 --> 01:39:49.802
not going to outrun a naval vessel!

01:39:49.802 --> 01:39:51.634
TRAVIS: No, I'm staying on the ship.

01:39:51.634 --> 01:39:54.738
SAM: What are <i>you</i> going to do? You're one man!
You're going to sail the ship away?!

01:39:54.738 --> 01:39:58.809
TRAVIS: Yeah, you'll stay with me, I'll make you
the little lackey that moves shit.

01:39:58.809 --> 01:40:01.468
SAM: (sputtering, sighs)

01:40:01.468 --> 01:40:05.863
TRAVIS: I'll keep Marius and I'll keep Gallan.

01:40:05.863 --> 01:40:08.568
SAM: I don't like this.

01:40:08.568 --> 01:40:11.900
LIAM: How close to the shore do we get with the
ship? The ship proper.

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:18.318
TRAVIS: I don't know. A quarter mile off the
coast? A couple hundred yards? I don't know, how

01:40:18.318 --> 01:40:21.101
close do you get to the ship if you want to take
the skiff in?

01:40:21.101 --> 01:40:25.697
MATT: You'd have to get fairly close to even drop
anchor, and you don't want to have to row--

01:40:25.697 --> 01:40:27.713
LIAM: You picked a sailor, man.

01:40:27.713 --> 01:40:31.029
TRAVIS: I know, I wished I'd picked an astronaut.
Then I wouldn't be fucked.

01:40:31.029 --> 01:40:33.920
(laughter)

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:41.950
MATT: The strangest of Wildemount backgrounds. You
have to get pretty close unless you want somebody

01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:44.728
to be rowing that boat for a long time.

01:40:44.728 --> 01:40:46.727
TRAVIS: Which I do, because I want to punish
them.

01:40:46.727 --> 01:40:50.380
MATT: Honesty, I appreciate that.

01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:51.780
TRAVIS: 150 yards.

01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:58.902
MATT: Okay. This'll be interesting. You're helming
the ship?

01:40:58.902 --> 01:41:01.415
TRAVIS: Based off the last game, right?

01:41:01.415 --> 01:41:06.732
SAM: What will you be able to do by staying on the
ship? If another vessel--

01:41:06.732 --> 01:41:10.868
TRAVIS: What if a Zhelezo ship comes around and
arrests Yasha? We can at least get--

01:41:10.868 --> 01:41:12.904
SAM: No, if you're on the ship and a Zhelezo boat
comes out--

01:41:12.904 --> 01:41:16.503
TRAVIS: We drop sail, we take off and I leave you
guys in the cove.

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:18.795
SAM: With one person?!

01:41:18.795 --> 01:41:20.186
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:41:20.186 --> 01:41:25.600
MATT: Okay, as you're making your way towards
Nicodranas having this conversation, the Zhelezo

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:33.281
ship is doing its patrol across. You have to time
the best way to come through without gaining its

01:41:33.281 --> 01:41:37.947
attention. Who wants to be in charge of trying to
navigate the ship?

01:41:37.947 --> 01:41:39.901
SAM: You, you're the sailor.

01:41:39.901 --> 01:41:47.480
MATT: That would be you, I think, Fjord. Make an
intelligence check and I'll give you advantage,

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:54.509
because you have a sailor background and you
understand some of the pathways, especially since

01:41:54.509 --> 01:41:57.767
watching and noticing this earlier with Caduceus,
you've seen it move back and forth.

01:41:57.767 --> 01:41:59.191
TRAVIS: 16.

01:41:59.191 --> 01:42:11.542
MATT: The Zhelezo ship passes by and it begins to
inspect another ship that is coming in from the

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.563
western trade route.

01:42:13.563 --> 01:42:16.482
LAURA: Should I draw up the deed?

01:42:16.482 --> 01:42:20.417
MATT: Okay, you want to make a forgery of it?

01:42:20.417 --> 01:42:24.226
LAURA: Should I be? Okay, I'm doing that as we're
going in and stuff.

01:42:24.226 --> 01:42:25.830
TRAVIS: This is very complicated.

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:28.556
MATT: As you're watching this, you're also helping
tell Jester what you think might be included in

01:42:28.556 --> 01:42:32.971
the paper that you've not really seen. Make--

01:42:32.971 --> 01:42:35.128
TRAVIS: I have not really seen?

01:42:35.128 --> 01:42:36.739
LAURA: I thought you said you had?

01:42:36.739 --> 01:42:41.794
MATT: You've seen the papers, but you haven't
studied very heavily what is contained on these.

01:42:41.794 --> 01:42:44.812
TRAVIS: What would the point be? Because the
wharfmaster, that's all he looks at.

01:42:44.812 --> 01:42:46.484
SAM: Do it in a different language! What other
languages do you speak?

01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:48.936
LAURA: Oh good question. I speak Infernal.

01:42:48.936 --> 01:42:57.102
SAM: A hell boat?! Is that really the only other
language you speak is Infernal?

01:42:57.102 --> 01:42:58.549
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:58.549 --> 01:43:00.447
SAM: What are you?

01:43:00.447 --> 01:43:06.411
MATT: She's a tiefling. If you'd like to make a
forgery check.

01:43:06.411 --> 01:43:11.516
TRAVIS: I'm open to all fucking suggestions. I
just wanted to park a boat and go get some crew.

01:43:11.516 --> 01:43:17.987
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your intelligence
modifier and your proficiency, because you are

01:43:17.987 --> 01:43:20.026
proficient with forgery.

01:43:20.026 --> 01:43:21.811
LAURA: I hate that it's intelligence.

01:43:21.811 --> 01:43:26.028
TALIESIN: That's an impressive roll.

01:43:26.028 --> 01:43:27.711
LAURA: 20.

01:43:27.711 --> 01:43:37.106
MATT: Holy shit! Okay, you craft what is probably
the most evenly-constructed and in some ways

01:43:37.106 --> 01:43:50.396
beautiful deeds to a ship. It has borders on it,
the signature that's on there looks very formal

01:43:50.396 --> 01:43:53.391
and probably from some naval captain.

01:43:53.391 --> 01:43:56.263
TALIESIN: And yet somehow there's a dick in the
signature.

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:57.657
MATT: Yeah, it's subtle.

01:43:57.657 --> 01:44:00.574
TRAVIS: The filigree on the borders. There's
little nut sack.

01:44:00.574 --> 01:44:05.915
MATT: You're not sure what the content would
require, but you've seen a few formal documents in

01:44:05.915 --> 01:44:11.585
passing, and you make it up as you go and you hope
it's enough. You're proud of it, but you hope it's enough.

01:44:11.585 --> 01:44:13.121
LAURA: This is really pretty.

01:44:13.344 --> 01:44:15.048
SAM: Don't forget to spray it with perfume.

01:44:15.048 --> 01:44:17.514
LAURA: Oh, right. A little lavender oil right in
the corner.

01:44:17.514 --> 01:44:21.799
MATT: Okay. Are you taking it in to dock, or are
you waiting outside and taking the skiff in?

01:44:21.799 --> 01:44:23.451
LAURA: We should take it to the dock.

01:44:23.451 --> 01:44:25.063
MATT: It's up to you.

01:44:25.063 --> 01:44:26.455
SAM and LAURA: That way we have you.

01:44:26.455 --> 01:44:33.123
TRAVIS: Let's take it into dock. Against all the
advice of zhelezo looking for a burned ship that

01:44:33.123 --> 01:44:34.302
had a Fireball.

01:44:34.302 --> 01:44:35.808
LAURA: It doesn't look burned anymore, does it?

01:44:35.808 --> 01:44:37.222
LIAM: Jester has fixed the sail.

01:44:37.222 --> 01:44:38.692
MATT: The sail's been fixed.

01:44:38.712 --> 01:44:42.053
TRAVIS: Blackened, charred wood on the outside of
it in a sphere shape.

01:44:42.053 --> 01:44:45.551
MARISHA: I thought we fixed-- did we fix that? Did
we fix the black sphere?

01:44:45.792 --> 01:44:49.247
MATT: The wood is being repaired, but it's a few
days of repair to get all that taken care of.

01:44:49.247 --> 01:44:54.578
LIAM: Also the Fireball went off the side of the
ship, so the edge of the ship would be burned.

01:44:54.578 --> 01:44:57.040
TRAVIS: I like it. Let's go into the dock. I love
this plan.

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.860
MARISHA: We always make these plans and then
abandon them.

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.852
MATT: That's D&D, man. That's how it works.

01:45:01.852 --> 01:45:05.629
SAM: No, let's take the skiff in. If you want to
take the skiff, we can take the skiff.

01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:10.461
TRAVIS: Nope, this is an adventuring party. Let's
go into the dock.

01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:13.230
MATT: Okay. Restless Wharf or the Open Quay?

01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:17.454
TRAVIS: The one that we were not just killing
people at.

01:45:17.454 --> 01:45:23.603
MATT: Open Quay, okay. You make your way towards
the Open Quay. Thankfully, you timed it so that

01:45:23.603 --> 01:45:29.003
the one patrolling Zhelezo ship that you see is
currently invested in another ship that it's

01:45:29.003 --> 01:45:35.415
interfacing with. You make your way to the Open
Quay. You make it to the docks.

01:45:35.415 --> 01:45:38.871
LAURA: Disguise Self as we get closer.

01:45:38.871 --> 01:45:43.615
MATT: All of you that are on there, and you're
applying a disguise kit to Beau? If you wouldn't

01:45:43.615 --> 01:45:48.444
mind rolling a d20, add your dexterity modifier
and your proficiency modifier.

01:45:48.444 --> 01:45:54.091
TRAVIS: We will tell Marius and Gallan to stay
below the entire time.

01:45:54.091 --> 01:45:56.263
MARISHA: Good call.

01:45:56.263 --> 01:45:57.885
TRAVIS: And Yasha.

01:45:57.885 --> 01:45:59.447
LAURA: 18 plus three.

01:45:59.471 --> 01:46:01.453
SAM: Yasha's staying on the boat with--?

01:46:01.459 --> 01:46:05.186
MATT: Yeah, Yasha's staying below and keeping an
eye on the rest of your crew. With that, you're

01:46:05.186 --> 01:46:12.970
approached at the docks. The dockmaster there
takes your document, is going to inspect it and

01:46:12.970 --> 01:46:25.629
rolled pretty well, but you rolled a 20. He looks
and seems to be taken aback at how well designed

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:33.725
versus the occasional chicken scratch and heavily
stained, ocean air-tattered pieces of paper are

01:46:33.725 --> 01:46:40.502
handed to him. Seems to accept it and you guys
make your way onto the Open Quay docks. You're

01:46:40.502 --> 01:46:45.126
there, you drop anchor. What do you wish to do
while you're here?

01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:51.470
MARISHA: I hand off 20 gold to Caleb. Here. Here's
for hiring crew.

01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:52.916
LIAM: Okay.

01:46:52.916 --> 01:46:54.874
SAM: Are there any-- yes?

01:46:54.874 --> 01:46:56.844
MARISHA: You're with me on the whisper campaign?

01:46:56.844 --> 01:46:58.732
SAM: I am the whisper campaign.

01:46:58.732 --> 01:47:00.665
MARISHA: That's what I'm talking about.

01:47:00.665 --> 01:47:06.763
SAM: But wait. Before we go, is there anyone
walking about the docks? You know, like dockhands?

01:47:07.016 --> 01:47:08.342
MATT: Oh plenty.

01:47:08.342 --> 01:47:13.885
SAM: Okay. Should we buy anyone off to be like,
"This ship's fine, we checked it."

01:47:13.885 --> 01:47:15.869
LAURA: To say that we've been here awhile or
something?

01:47:15.869 --> 01:47:22.202
SAM: Yeah, or if anyone comes asking they're like,
"Oh yeah, these guys just came in from, I don't

01:47:22.202 --> 01:47:24.517
"know, Marquet or something."

01:47:24.517 --> 01:47:26.865
MATT: If anybody that would be the dockmaster.

01:47:26.865 --> 01:47:29.633
LIAM: The dockmaster is the one person who's in
charge of the whole area.

01:47:30.241 --> 01:47:32.051
TRAVIS: The wharfmaster Ignus.

01:47:32.051 --> 01:47:34.750
MATT: Well, that's in the other side. That's up at
the Restless Wharf.

01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:36.499
SAM: The guy we just gave the papers to?

01:47:36.499 --> 01:47:37.605
MATT: Yes.

01:47:37.605 --> 01:47:39.238
SAM: Go bribe him!

01:47:39.238 --> 01:47:40.371
LAURA: Give him five gold.

01:47:40.371 --> 01:47:43.759
SAM: Ten gold. Do it!

01:47:43.759 --> 01:47:45.382
TRAVIS: You want me to do it?

01:47:45.382 --> 01:47:47.774
SAM: Yeah, you're the sailor guy! This is your
whole episode!

01:47:47.774 --> 01:47:53.090
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll go find that guy with five
gold.

01:47:54.097 --> 01:48:03.168
MATT: Okay, you approach. This is a human fellow,
lanky with a very pronounced Adam's apple and a

01:48:03.168 --> 01:48:12.842
cleft chin. Big sideburns and this mop of
reddish-brown hair, a thick sweater on that

01:48:12.842 --> 01:48:17.476
bunches up around the neck. He turns back as you
approach. "Hi, can I help you?"

01:48:17.476 --> 01:48:21.961
TRAVIS: Yes. We're trying to get in and out of
port as fast as we can looking to acquire a few

01:48:21.961 --> 01:48:27.405
crew members. Would you do me a favor though?
I'll produce the five gold and say: Would you mind

01:48:27.405 --> 01:48:30.985
telling any inquiring minds that we've been here
for awhile and that we're coming from--

01:48:30.985 --> 01:48:33.184
MATT: "You're on The Mistake?"

01:48:33.184 --> 01:48:37.276
TRAVIS: The Mistake, that's correct, yes, and we
are coming over from-- what was the port in

01:48:37.276 --> 01:48:38.515
between Port Damali and this one?

01:48:38.795 --> 01:48:40.970
MATT: Well there's two, but Port Zoon's the
closest.

01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:44.709
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're out of Port Zoon and we're
just trying to get there and back in the same

01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:46.629
day if we can.

01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:48.292
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:48:48.292 --> 01:48:50.524
TRAVIS: 15.

01:48:50.524 --> 01:49:04.872
MATT: He gives you a nod and goes to shake your
hand and goes, "Understood." Slips the coin into

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:10.785
his hand. "All right, in and out real quick." Take the
paper, folds it and hands it back to you.

01:49:10.785 --> 01:49:19.295
TRAVIS: Is there a posting for people looking for
crew positions? A sign?

01:49:19.295 --> 01:49:24.849
MATT: "For that you're probably going to look
outside of the Seafloor's Bounty or probably on

01:49:24.849 --> 01:49:26.745
"the board at the Withered Bird Inn."

01:49:26.745 --> 01:49:28.281
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:49:28.281 --> 01:49:32.711
MATT: Seafloor's Bounty or the Withered Bird Inn.

01:49:32.711 --> 01:49:39.543
TALIESIN: Nothing like a bar with "withered" in the
name.

01:49:39.543 --> 01:49:40.460
LAURA: Yeah, right?

01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:45.009
MATT: Welcome to the Open Quay. What are you guys
doing while you're here?

01:49:45.143 --> 01:49:49.372
LAURA: Hiring crew and we're going to get some
food for the thing.

01:49:49.372 --> 01:49:53.701
TALIESIN: We're going to need food and supplies,
so anything that you think that we might need,

01:49:53.701 --> 01:49:56.138
I'll go pick that up.

01:49:56.138 --> 01:50:00.647
TRAVIS: I'll tell them the amount of supplies that
I think they need to pick up for a month's worth

01:50:00.647 --> 01:50:03.678
of travel.

01:50:03.678 --> 01:50:12.806
MATT: Okay. That'd be a lot of additional rope,
some repair materials for the ship, maybe an

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:17.270
additional set of tools, a couple of empty
barrels, just in case you need them. Actually

01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:20.697
quite a few barrels if you're going to be buying a
lot more food, because right now, since they had

01:50:20.697 --> 01:50:24.389
stocked up with what they had felt they needed
just for their crew and the short trip they were

01:50:24.389 --> 01:50:27.720
making their way there, if you're stocking up for
a while, you're going to need more means of

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.065
transport and storage.

01:50:29.202 --> 01:50:34.029
LAURA: Okay, I've disguised myself to look like an
old, grizzled sailor.

01:50:34.029 --> 01:50:42.075
MATT: Perfect. Okay. It takes you a few hours, but
you gather the materials that are needed. The total

01:50:42.075 --> 01:50:46.474
MATT: cost for all of the materials together, for
all of you-- is it food for a month as well?

01:50:46.498 --> 01:50:51.495
TALIESIN: I'll even go so far as to say good food
for a month. I'm going to bake some shit. Fuck it.

01:50:51.538 --> 01:50:57.221
I also know that I can create food if I have to,
so I can do a lot of, like, base--

01:50:57.221 --> 01:51:01.297
MATT: For a month, that's going to be about, I'd
say 300 gold.

01:51:01.567 --> 01:51:03.352
TALIESIN: I do not have 300 gold.

01:51:03.352 --> 01:51:09.787
MATT: If it's good food, for all of you guys and
the people that you're hiring on the crew, to feed

01:51:09.787 --> 01:51:12.848
all of you, every day, for a month?

01:51:12.876 --> 01:51:14.268
LIAM: How about mac 'n' cheese?

01:51:14.268 --> 01:51:15.981
TALIESIN: What's adequate food?

01:51:15.981 --> 01:51:17.889
MATT: Adequate food will put you at about 100
gold.

01:51:17.889 --> 01:51:22.542
LAURA: Well, let's do that. I'll do 50 gold and
you do 50 gold.

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:25.029
TALIESIN: I'll do 50 gold, plus I'll up my spice
to make do.

01:51:25.029 --> 01:51:33.589
MATT: Okay. It's still better food than most
sailors have on long trips for that cost. That's

01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:40.413
for you and the entire crew you're hiring and the
two you have on your ship, for a month. Okay, so

01:51:40.413 --> 01:51:41.948
you acquire that bit.

01:51:41.948 --> 01:51:49.364
LIAM: I would say that I look like a somewhat plump,
good, Zemnian boy, blond, and a little rounder.

01:51:49.364 --> 01:51:51.151
MATT: <i>Ach, ein</i> Zemnian boy!

01:51:51.151 --> 01:51:53.450
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, a little bit!

01:51:53.509 --> 01:51:55.199
SAM: Augustus Gloop!

01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:56.807
MATT: Augustus Gloop, exactly!

01:51:56.807 --> 01:52:00.451
LIAM: Don't make me run, I'm full of chocolates! I
saw Fjord talking to the wharfmaster, so I will

01:52:00.451 --> 01:52:03.761
wait until Fjord is finished, and then I will go
up and talk to him as well.

01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.379
MATT: Okay, cool.

01:52:05.379 --> 01:52:11.370
LIAM: Excuse me, we have been doing very well on
our travels at sea, and we are looking to share

01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:17.762
the duties and want to hire a bigger crew. I know
there's many docks around here, but why wouldn't I

01:52:17.762 --> 01:52:22.925
start here, of course. Do you know-- is this a
good place, is there anyone who's looking for work

01:52:22.925 --> 01:52:28.908
right now? We're going on a journey, oh, you know,
three or four or five or six weeks, perhaps.

01:52:28.908 --> 01:52:30.999
One-time job.

01:52:30.999 --> 01:52:36.475
MATT: Glances at you, glances at you, glances
back. "Yeah, if you're looking to hire, you'll

01:52:36.475 --> 01:52:43.401
"find most of them at either the posting at the
Seafloor's Bounty, or the Withered Bird Inn."

01:52:43.401 --> 01:52:45.604
LIAM: Oh, I'm so sorry, did you cover that
already?

01:52:45.604 --> 01:52:48.297
MATT: "Yes, but now both of you are informed."

01:52:48.297 --> 01:52:50.131
LIAM: Excellent.

01:52:50.131 --> 01:52:52.142
MATT: "So good luck."

01:52:52.142 --> 01:52:53.955
SAM: I come wandering up.

01:52:53.955 --> 01:52:57.841
(laughter)

01:52:57.841 --> 01:53:00.140
SAM: (shouting) We need a crew!

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.372
MATT: Ugh!

01:53:02.372 --> 01:53:04.776
SAM: I look like Cap'n Crunch, by the way.

01:53:04.776 --> 01:53:10.941
(laughter)

01:53:10.941 --> 01:53:14.131
SAM: All right. We know what we're doing, right?

01:53:14.412 --> 01:53:16.171
LIAM: For real though, like a real-world Cap'n
Crunch?

01:53:16.171 --> 01:53:20.793
SAM: Yeah, short, hat, white moustache.

01:53:20.793 --> 01:53:30.059
MATT: I'm so happy this campaign you guys have a
mostly deceptive, illusory-based party. This

01:53:30.059 --> 01:53:35.607
really makes for a lot of shenanigans You guys
start looking for a crew to hire. How many crew

01:53:35.607 --> 01:53:37.454
are you looking to hire?

01:53:37.454 --> 01:53:39.698
TRAVIS: Seven. No, six. Crew of six.

01:53:39.698 --> 01:53:44.290
MATT: Crew of six. You have two with you already.

01:53:44.315 --> 01:53:46.192
LAURA: Yeah, and you can be the captain.

01:53:46.236 --> 01:53:48.336
LIAM: Carpenter, captain, so we need a boatswain.

01:53:48.336 --> 01:53:53.002
TRAVIS: We need a boatswain. Well, we've got the
cook. We need a quartermaster, we need a

01:53:53.002 --> 01:53:57.414
navigator, and a captain. If we don't need a cook
or a carpenter--

01:53:57.414 --> 01:53:59.721
LIAM: What came between boatswain and navigator?

01:53:59.721 --> 01:54:02.178
MATT: A barrel keeper.

01:54:02.178 --> 01:54:04.115
LIAM: Okay.

01:54:04.115 --> 01:54:13.279
MATT: You've worked as a boatswain before. That's
primarily what you've done, as well as some

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:18.264
element of barrel keeping in your travels. Those
are primarily what your skills would fall under.

01:54:18.264 --> 01:54:23.116
TRAVIS: Sweet. Let's call it a crew of five.

01:54:23.116 --> 01:54:24.399
MATT: Okay.

01:54:24.399 --> 01:54:29.362
TRAVIS: Captain, navigator, quartermaster, cook,
and another boatswain slash barrel keeper.

01:54:29.362 --> 01:54:31.084
MARISHA: Can you be a cook?

01:54:31.084 --> 01:54:33.469
TALIESIN: I am a cook.

01:54:33.469 --> 01:54:35.086
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:54:35.086 --> 01:54:36.404
TRAVIS: Me?

01:54:36.404 --> 01:54:37.752
MATT: Yes.

01:54:37.752 --> 01:54:39.190
TRAVIS: Ten.

01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:40.140
MATT: Ten? Okay.

01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:42.806
TALIESIN: I look like Shaggy from the special
episode of Scooby Doo where he's pretending

01:54:42.806 --> 01:54:45.198
to be a pirate.

01:54:45.198 --> 01:54:50.675
MATT: You find a few folk that are pretty good,
so you hire pretty much for all the other positions

01:54:50.675 --> 01:54:53.695
you need. The navigator's the one you're having a
hard time with. Everyone you've talked to is like,

01:54:53.695 --> 01:55:00.296
"Yeah! I can sail the sea!" And you're like, "Hm.
Nah." You're having a harder time finding a navigator.

01:55:00.296 --> 01:55:02.036
SAM: Maybe we should go elsewhere.

01:55:02.292 --> 01:55:03.421
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:55:03.421 --> 01:55:05.502
SAM: Let's go elsewhere.

01:55:05.502 --> 01:55:06.875
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:55:06.875 --> 01:55:08.604
MARISHA: Wait, are we at a bar or something?

01:55:08.604 --> 01:55:11.485
TRAVIS: No, we're at the docks right now.
We'll go to the Seafloor Bounty first.

01:55:11.485 --> 01:55:13.113
LIAM: Seafloor Bounty.

01:55:13.113 --> 01:55:17.121
MATT: All right. I'm assuming in this degree,
you're going to these places to find these hires,

01:55:17.121 --> 01:55:21.954
as opposed to having to roleplay every interview
with each of these crewmen.

01:55:21.954 --> 01:55:24.346
TALIESIN: It's been awhile. I don't know. Sorry!

01:55:24.346 --> 01:55:25.606
MATT: That's true.

01:55:25.606 --> 01:55:26.398
TRAVIS: We never know, we might kill them, so--

01:55:26.398 --> 01:55:27.646
MATT: Yeah, that's possible.

01:55:27.646 --> 01:55:30.564
MARISHA: If we stop at any bars along the way
(whispering) whisper campaign.

01:55:30.564 --> 01:55:36.859
LIAM: Do you know what this is reminding me of,
though? Is getting the crew for our keep in the

01:55:36.859 --> 01:55:38.547
last home game.

01:55:38.547 --> 01:55:39.808
TALIESIN: That was totally what I was thinking
about.

01:55:39.808 --> 01:55:41.088
MATT: Kind of.

01:55:41.093 --> 01:55:43.826
TALIESIN: We also make them fight and try to kill
each other.

01:55:43.826 --> 01:55:46.694
MATT: So whisper campaign. One of you make a
deception check and one of you make an

01:55:46.694 --> 01:55:48.296
investigation check.

01:55:48.590 --> 01:55:50.072
SAM: I'll do investigation.

01:55:50.072 --> 01:55:54.939
MARISHA: Okay. I'll do deception. Natural 20.

01:55:54.939 --> 01:55:56.622
MATT: Oh shit!

01:55:56.622 --> 01:55:58.160
TALIESIN: Thank god.

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:05.436
SAM: It's not a roll. Not great. Investigation.
17.

01:56:05.436 --> 01:56:08.490
MATT: 17. That's pretty good.

01:56:08.490 --> 01:56:10.622
SAM: Wasn't a good roll, but I have a lot of
plus.

01:56:10.622 --> 01:56:14.343
MATT: There you go. All right. What whispers do
you want to disseminate?

01:56:14.343 --> 01:56:20.971
MARISHA: I disseminate that these ruffian pirates,
coming in, messing up our nice and peaceful

01:56:20.971 --> 01:56:30.395
Nicodranas again. I heard it was that Captain
Jawgrasp. He came in and he deceived his own crew,

01:56:30.395 --> 01:56:35.727
and he murdered them all in a plot of vengeance
and greed, and then he took the boat, and he went

01:56:35.727 --> 01:56:37.641
off on his own.

01:56:37.641 --> 01:56:42.905
MATT: All right. As you're spreading this rumor,
you start hearing people responding to that being

01:56:42.905 --> 01:56:45.204
like, "Jawgrasp, wasn't he found dead at the docks
the other night?"

01:56:45.204 --> 01:56:47.569
SAM: Let's adjust--

01:56:47.569 --> 01:56:52.931
MATT: Hold on. You do find out that a number of
the corpses that were gathered, the two names that

01:56:52.931 --> 01:56:57.457
you find are Captain Javeed Jawgrasp and Mattheus
Freecall. They were both known criminals that had

01:56:57.457 --> 01:57:06.462
bounties on their head. In one hand, there is a
search for, or at least there is an understanding

01:57:06.462 --> 01:57:13.974
that some unknown do-gooders were responsible for
killing two people with bounties on their heads.

01:57:13.974 --> 01:57:21.676
However, there was a blue-skinned tiefling that
killed herself on the dock and people are trying

01:57:21.676 --> 01:57:28.808
to find out information. They're searching for the
body, and they're trying to find out who that was.

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:39.072
Apparently, a ship was taken from some of the
surviving crew of these people. You're getting the

01:57:39.072 --> 01:57:45.500
idea that the guards didn't realize there was a
conflict happening, and just assumed that whoever

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:49.860
took the boat, you guys, were members of this
Captain Jawgrasp's crew.

01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:53.150
LIAM: The rumor we're trying to spread is what
they already think.

01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:55.379
SAM: The whisper campaign succeeded!

01:57:55.379 --> 01:57:58.416
MARISHA: Succeeded? Yeah! We're already great!

01:57:58.862 --> 01:58:03.381
SAM: But we should adjust it, right? If they're
looking for Jester, why don't we put in a little

01:58:03.381 --> 01:58:07.595
doubt, right? They're looking for a blue-skinned
tiefling. Why don't we just say: Oh, I heard it

01:58:07.595 --> 01:58:15.854
was a green-skinned dwarf, or something like that.
Just do a little confusion so maybe they're not

01:58:15.854 --> 01:58:21.294
sure who it was, who killed herself on the dock. I
heard she was already crazy, or something like

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:29.768
that. And then maybe the ship that was taken.
Didn't it have that distinct three-mast silhouette

01:58:29.768 --> 01:58:31.786
that you would definitely recognize?

01:58:31.786 --> 01:58:33.908
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh yeah!

01:58:33.908 --> 01:58:36.098
SAM: Yeah. We could do some of that.

01:58:36.098 --> 01:58:43.356
MARISHA: It was so dark, but the sails seemed
black like the heart of Captain Jawgrasp.

01:58:43.356 --> 01:58:45.064
SAM: Yeah, sure.

01:58:45.064 --> 01:58:47.063
MARISHA: Just like his soul.

01:58:47.063 --> 01:58:48.240
SAM: A little flourish.

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:55.022
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe this-- We got to come up with
something better than green-skinned dwarf. That's

01:58:55.022 --> 01:58:56.978
not a real thing.

01:58:56.978 --> 01:58:57.508
SAM: What?

01:58:57.573 --> 01:58:59.580
TALIESIN: That's how we do it at home, is you
raise your hand.

01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:06.404
SAM: What is it, Mr. Clay? We want your input, as
you are definitely part of this team.

01:59:06.404 --> 01:59:17.615
TALIESIN: I see what you're doing and I like it. I
like a good ghost story. Maybe--

01:59:17.615 --> 01:59:21.608
MARISHA: Ooh. This is getting so complicated with
each layer!

01:59:21.608 --> 01:59:27.743
TALIESIN: Maybe they saw everybody knows the
legend of the little devil girl who drowned a

01:59:27.743 --> 01:59:30.155
hundred years ago.

01:59:30.155 --> 01:59:33.078
SAM: And you see her every hundred years?

01:59:33.078 --> 01:59:35.352
TALIESIN: Every now and then, someone reports
about seeing--

01:59:35.352 --> 01:59:37.933
TRAVIS: Jason Voorhees Jester.

01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:41.098
LIAM: Yes, more often than a hundred years.

01:59:41.098 --> 01:59:43.833
TALIESIN: Everyone loves a good dock tour. Like, a
haunted dock tour.

01:59:43.833 --> 01:59:45.218
LIAM and MARISHA: That's true.

01:59:45.218 --> 01:59:47.575
TALIESIN: Well, I like a haunted tour. I've never
actually been to a dock, now that I think about it.

01:59:47.837 --> 01:59:51.921
MARISHA: She drove the captain mad with the
vengeance--

01:59:51.921 --> 02:00:00.301
LAURA: No! He drove her crazy with love! And she
killed herself because she couldn't be with him!

02:00:00.301 --> 02:00:07.835
MARISHA: Yeah. Now her spirit lives on, and she is
haunting sailors, looking for her long-lost lover!

02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:09.560
LAURA: I love it!

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:14.660
MATT: All right. You've planted the seeds of this
ghost story on the docks. In an attempt to co-opt

02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:23.047
the story of this blue-skinned, horned tiefling,
you've also disseminated the information that

02:00:23.047 --> 02:00:29.058
Jawgrasp died somehow in line with this ghost
story.

02:00:29.058 --> 02:00:31.529
MARISHA: I'm just saying. Spooky coincidences.

02:00:31.529 --> 02:00:33.061
SAM: The curse.

02:00:33.061 --> 02:00:35.268
MATT: We'll see if it sticks. You've set the
seeds.

02:00:35.268 --> 02:00:39.071
MARISHA: We, once again, put misinformation out
about the boat.

02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:40.719
MATT: Okay.

02:00:40.719 --> 02:00:41.995
LAURA and MARISHA: What it looked like.

02:00:41.995 --> 02:00:47.361
MATT: Okay. Remember, everything you've heard are
all been common rumors. People just talking who

02:00:47.361 --> 02:00:50.865
hear the whispers you're saying and the tales, and
retorting with what they've heard in the past

02:00:50.865 --> 02:00:55.523
morning because there was hubbub. People there are
discussing what they saw or heard about what happened.

02:00:55.579 --> 02:00:57.546
LIAM: Rumors only grow.

02:00:57.717 --> 02:01:03.609
MATT: But you haven't seen any of the guards that
were present. All right, cool! While that's

02:01:03.609 --> 02:01:05.546
happening, you're all still trying to find a
navigator.

02:01:05.546 --> 02:01:09.242
LIAM: Find that navigator. Did we find the rest?

02:01:09.242 --> 02:01:11.859
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

02:01:11.859 --> 02:01:17.405
LIAM: Oh. 14.

02:01:17.405 --> 02:01:24.117
MATT: 14? Okay. You have met one navigator
before.

02:01:24.117 --> 02:01:27.039
LAURA: (gasp) I remember!

02:01:27.039 --> 02:01:28.412
LIAM: I do not.

02:01:28.412 --> 02:01:31.146
LAURA: Was it Orly?

02:01:31.146 --> 02:01:33.205
MARISHA: I think it was Orly.

02:01:33.205 --> 02:01:35.771
LIAM: Was it within the last month? Then you have
to tell me who it is.

02:01:35.771 --> 02:01:37.654
MATT: That's what I did, it's Orly.

02:01:37.654 --> 02:01:39.467
LIAM: She said Orly, you didn't confirm it!

02:01:39.467 --> 02:01:40.831
MATT: I was waiting to see if you'd pick up on
it.

02:01:41.111 --> 02:01:42.492
TALIESIN: Oh really?

02:01:42.492 --> 02:01:50.221
MATT: Oh. That's going to cost you. Caduceus'
intelligence just went to eight.

02:01:50.221 --> 02:01:53.039
TALIESIN: That was all me, that wasn't Caduceus.
Ugh.

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:54.523
MARISHA: Let's go get Orly.

02:01:54.523 --> 02:01:55.726
SAM: He's in the other port.

02:01:55.726 --> 02:01:57.013
TRAVIS: That's all right, go get them. We don't
look like ourselves.

02:01:57.013 --> 02:01:59.341
LIAM: Yeah, we'll walk there. We need turtle
power.

02:01:59.341 --> 02:02:00.919
SAM: How long is the walk?

02:02:00.919 --> 02:02:06.025
MATT: From here? I'd say-- Carefully? About an
hour.

02:02:06.274 --> 02:02:08.505
SAM: An hour. We'd have to re-spellify ourselves.

02:02:08.505 --> 02:02:10.775
LAURA: We can send a message to him.

02:02:10.775 --> 02:02:15.241
SAM: Oh! How do you send a message to him? You
mean, like, spell Message?

02:02:15.241 --> 02:02:16.851
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

02:02:17.081 --> 02:02:18.595
SAM: He's not going to respond to that!

02:02:18.595 --> 02:02:19.850
TALIESIN: If there's money involved.

02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:21.197
LAURA: Yeah, hold on.

02:02:21.197 --> 02:02:22.939
SAM: All right. Think hard about this.

02:02:22.939 --> 02:02:25.052
LAURA: This is a powerful spell.

02:02:25.052 --> 02:02:28.669
LIAM: Offer money from the get-go.

02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:30.435
SAM: Come to Open Quay.

02:02:30.435 --> 02:02:33.113
LAURA: Come to The Mistake in the Open Quay.

02:02:33.113 --> 02:02:36.032
SAM: Lose all the thes.

02:02:36.032 --> 02:02:40.785
LAURA: Come to Mistake in Open Quay. We've got
money for you as a navigator.

02:02:40.785 --> 02:02:42.731
TALIESIN: Job opportunity.

02:02:42.731 --> 02:02:44.146
SAM: You still have more words.

02:02:44.146 --> 02:02:48.374
MARISHA: Should we say, "We're The Mighty Nein,
we met you the other night"? No, maybe not.

02:02:48.374 --> 02:02:52.624
SAM: Why do we know that he likes or hangs out
with?

02:02:52.624 --> 02:02:54.420
LAURA: Marius.

02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:57.524
SAM: Oh, we can say "Marius needs help. Come to
Open Quay--"

02:02:57.524 --> 02:02:59.430
LAURA and LIAM: No.

02:02:59.430 --> 02:03:00.814
SAM: No? Shit.

02:03:00.814 --> 02:03:04.625
LIAM: Just say, your messages, you put it: Your
friends from the other night. That's it.

02:03:04.625 --> 02:03:07.183
LAURA: Dear Orly--

02:03:07.183 --> 02:03:12.664
MATT: That's the first two. Go.

02:03:12.664 --> 02:03:17.948
TALIESIN: (singing) How are you? I'm fine.
Everybody else is too.

02:03:17.948 --> 02:03:37.041
LAURA: Come to Open Quay. The Mistake will hire
you as a navigator. Lots o'money. That's one word.

02:03:37.068 --> 02:03:38.951
MATT: (uncertain groan)

02:03:38.951 --> 02:03:43.520
LAURA: O'money. Of money. Okay. Lots of money. No,
no.

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:44.960
MATT: No, I know.

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:48.776
SAM: Now?

02:03:48.776 --> 02:03:51.050
LAURA: How many words do I have left?

02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:53.064
SAM: Is that 17 that she's--

02:03:53.064 --> 02:03:54.594
MATT: Yeah, eight left.

02:03:54.594 --> 02:03:55.959
LIAM: Eight left?

02:03:56.003 --> 02:03:58.268
SAM: Come now. Also, The Mistake is a boat.

02:03:58.539 --> 02:04:07.371
LAURA: Come now. Also, The Mistake is a boat.

02:04:07.371 --> 02:04:20.758
MATT: Yep. There's a brief pause, and eventually,
you hear this voice come through, "I'll swing on

02:04:20.758 --> 02:04:29.913
"over. Soon as I m-m-muster the energy to finish
my breakfast."

02:04:29.913 --> 02:04:31.488
LAURA: He's coming.

02:04:31.488 --> 02:04:40.677
MATT: Little time passes, and sauntering up onto
the dock, you see the massive, waddling form of

02:04:40.677 --> 02:04:46.411
the tortle, with the sack over the shoulder. The
rest of the deckhands look and give a nod. Some

02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:53.731
recognize him, others are still like, "Fucking
tortles, they're weird." Then eventually makes his

02:04:53.731 --> 02:05:01.503
way to the ship, over to the skiff and goes-- Oh
no, you guys have the ship in dock. You brought it

02:05:01.503 --> 02:05:11.103
all in there. He walks over and steps up onto the
gangplank. "So whom-- who am I talking to?"

02:05:11.387 --> 02:05:16.282
TRAVIS: Me, apparently.

02:05:16.282 --> 02:05:28.772
MATT: "Hey there, it's real good to see you again.
I heard from some m-m-mysterious magic voice that

02:05:28.772 --> 02:05:34.644
"you were going to hire someone to navigate."

02:05:34.644 --> 02:05:37.083
TRAVIS: We were hoping your services weren't
spoken for.

02:05:37.083 --> 02:05:42.324
MATT: "How long you looking to need m-m-me?"

02:05:42.324 --> 02:05:45.387
TRAVIS: Few weeks? At the most, maybe only a
couple.

02:05:45.387 --> 02:05:51.566
LIAM: Do you know who you're talking to? We all
look different from the last time that we have met.

02:05:51.566 --> 02:05:54.701
MATT: "I have no idea."

02:05:54.701 --> 02:06:00.662
LIAM: We came to see you, we talked about that
we-- a man named--

02:06:00.662 --> 02:06:04.419
LAURA: Shush, just let him get on the boat before
we tell him these things.

02:06:04.419 --> 02:06:09.738
LIAM: We like the look of you. We have a good job
and big money.

02:06:09.738 --> 02:06:18.373
MATT: "I'm m-m-mighty confused, but money
definitely drives, so."

02:06:18.373 --> 02:06:21.930
SAM: How much do you charge on a weekly rate?

02:06:21.930 --> 02:06:33.864
MATT: "Weekly, let me think. 35 gold?"

02:06:33.864 --> 02:06:35.940
MARISHA: (shouting) A week?!

02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.325
TRAVIS: A week.

02:06:37.325 --> 02:06:38.436
LIAM: A week, yeah, it's--

02:06:38.436 --> 02:06:41.191
SAM: We might be gone a month or two.

02:06:41.191 --> 02:06:43.201
LIAM: Well, I have 20 gold.

02:06:43.201 --> 02:06:46.289
TRAVIS: 27 gold a week.

02:06:46.289 --> 02:06:48.435
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:06:48.435 --> 02:06:48.885
MARISHA: Yes.

02:06:48.885 --> 02:06:52.522
LAURA: How are we going to get enough gold to pay
all of these people?

02:06:52.522 --> 02:06:54.452
SAM: He's literally our only job candidate.

02:06:54.452 --> 02:06:55.530
MATT: Yep.

02:06:55.530 --> 02:06:57.015
TRAVIS: 19.

02:06:57.015 --> 02:07:07.129
MATT: "Deal, <i>if</i> I get to choose my quarters."

02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:10.894
SAM: Choose your quarters?

02:07:10.894 --> 02:07:13.130
MATT: "M-m-my quarters."

02:07:13.130 --> 02:07:17.013
TRAVIS: We can accommodate that.

02:07:17.013 --> 02:07:25.986
MATT: "Then, m-m-my friend, it's a deal."
(laughter) Begins walking up the gangplank and

02:07:25.986 --> 02:07:34.309
then inflates the bag and (bagpipe sounds)
announces his presence onto the ship as he arrives.

02:07:34.353 --> 02:07:37.143
SAM: We're trying to be quiet.

02:07:37.262 --> 02:07:39.854
LIAM: A full Scottish send off when we leave.

02:07:39.854 --> 02:07:43.952
MATT: Yeah. You know, the more you hear it, the
more you're like, "Eh, it's not that bad,

02:07:43.952 --> 02:07:48.706
"actually." It's the initial note that kicks in and
once you get used to it, it's not bad.

02:07:48.706 --> 02:07:51.700
LIAM: It breathes better in open space.

02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:57.322
MATT: Yeah. All right, with your crew and supplies
acquired and--

02:07:57.322 --> 02:07:59.555
MARISHA: We did it.

02:07:59.555 --> 02:08:06.308
MATT: -- possible seeds of whispers disseminated,
some information gained about the scenario of

02:08:06.308 --> 02:08:10.184
those that you killed on the dock the night
before, and the knowledge that they're still

02:08:10.184 --> 02:08:19.172
searching for the rest of the crew, you make your
way off the dock. Are you going to try and pass by

02:08:19.172 --> 02:08:22.406
the Zhelezo ship once more? Because you're going
to have to to make your way out.

02:08:22.639 --> 02:08:24.121
TRAVIS: Well then, yeah.

02:08:24.121 --> 02:08:29.188
MARISHA: Can I assist him with counting as they go
by?

02:08:29.188 --> 02:08:34.586
MATT: Actually, with Orly hired and helping you
out with this. Did you tell Orly you were trying

02:08:34.586 --> 02:08:35.647
to avoid that ship?

02:08:36.231 --> 02:08:37.424
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:08:37.424 --> 02:08:50.357
MATT: Orly goes, "I think this helps me know what
kind of business we into." Okay, with advantage on

02:08:50.357 --> 02:08:58.884
that. Nice, all right. Quickly telling you, "All
right, go now, round about that way," he begins

02:08:58.884 --> 02:09:04.418
giving you the proper timing and based on your
previous information, without issue you manage to

02:09:04.418 --> 02:09:09.360
dodge the Zhelezo ship, make your way to open
waters and now, in the later afternoon, you guys

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:16.493
have now exited the outskirts of Nicodranas. We'll
see how much of what you've left behind helps to

02:09:16.493 --> 02:09:21.520
what you left behind the night before, but
nevertheless you have a crew, you have supplies,

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.452
and you are on the water. With that, we're going
to go ahead and take a break.

02:09:25.452 --> 02:09:26.729
SAM: Wow.

02:09:26.729 --> 02:09:28.863
LIAM: Nice, nice, nice.

02:09:28.863 --> 02:09:30.384
MATT: You hired the tortle!

02:09:30.384 --> 02:09:32.767
TRAVIS: Just keep him around.

02:09:32.767 --> 02:09:35.971
TALIESIN: I want to hear you do that voice
forever.

02:09:35.971 --> 02:09:41.890
MATT: Well I have to now. You fucking hired him.
I was thinking, I'm like, "They met a navigator.

02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:47.764
"Aw fuck." All right, so we're at the giveaway break.
We're going to be giving away this awesome

02:09:47.764 --> 02:09:54.304
Peruvian walnut tabletop dice tray by Wyrmwood. It
is slick, it is leather on the inside, it feels

02:09:54.304 --> 02:10:04.724
like. For this, the keyword tonight is "theft."
Come over to the Critical Role Twitch channel and

02:10:04.724 --> 02:10:09.699
the chat room to be a part of this giveaway during
the break, that's twitch.tv/criticalrole, enter

02:10:09.699 --> 02:10:14.438
the word "theft" once, any more than that and
you'll be disqualified. Once again, it's only good

02:10:14.438 --> 02:10:19.766
for those in the United States and Canada,
excluding Quebec, we're working on it. We'll have

02:10:19.766 --> 02:10:23.354
the winner when we come back, so see you guys here
in a few minutes. Yeah!

02:10:23.354 --> 02:29:47.296
[break]

02:29:47.614 --> 02:29:54.530
MATT: And welcome back. We have our winner of the
fantastic giveaway, the Peruvian walnut tabletop

02:29:54.530 --> 02:30:01.795
dice tray by our friends at Wyrmwood is Goku518.
That's right, not only does he keep coming back

02:30:01.795 --> 02:30:08.587
from the dead, he also wins dice trays. Goku, you
won this awesome tray. We'll get that sent out to

02:30:08.587 --> 02:30:14.394
you ASAP, we'll get your info. Congratulations,
and well done. Picking up where we left off, as

02:30:14.394 --> 02:30:20.911
Orly is on the ship, Orly also brings with him a
map of the Menagerie Coast. Because USPS is the

02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:23.856
fucking worst--

02:30:23.907 --> 02:30:26.197
SAM: Please sponsor our show. Please sponsor.

02:30:26.197 --> 02:30:30.400
MATT: -- it did not arrive in time, the full one,
so you'll have to deal with this printout for the

02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:34.090
time being, but there is one on the way.

02:30:34.090 --> 02:30:36.002
SAM: How big was the full one going to be?

02:30:36.002 --> 02:30:37.387
MATT: Pretty big.

02:30:37.387 --> 02:30:38.941
(disappointed groaning)

02:30:38.941 --> 02:30:45.876
MATT: I know. Next week, possibly at the live
show. There we go. That can be something for you

02:30:45.876 --> 02:30:49.499
to reference for your travels on the Menagerie
Coast.

02:30:49.499 --> 02:30:57.107
MARISHA: I keep sharpening it, and it's just
shit--

02:30:57.107 --> 02:31:01.423
LIAM: Rose gold.

02:31:01.423 --> 02:31:09.485
SAM: (Russian accent) Rose gold is best gold.
(regular accent) I'm wearing an Apple watch with a

02:31:09.485 --> 02:31:12.435
rose gold band on it.

02:31:12.435 --> 02:31:14.139
MATT: Oh, Sam.

02:31:14.139 --> 02:31:16.509
MARISHA: Mine and Matt's wedding rings are rose
gold.

02:31:16.509 --> 02:31:18.328
SAM: (Russian accent) It is the best color.

02:31:18.328 --> 02:31:22.787
MATT: (mimicking accent) It is good for for
wedding materials as well, yes.

02:31:22.787 --> 02:31:30.283
(regular accent) Mighty Nein, you have your crew.
This is a pretty packed ship for a runner ship,

02:31:30.283 --> 02:31:36.044
because you have a full crew, and then on top of
that, you have you guys. As opposed to training

02:31:36.044 --> 02:31:42.543
as sailors, you've hired more on top of what you
have, so now you have a very busy ship. However,

02:31:42.543 --> 02:31:48.567
you are out and about on the ocean. What are
you guys going to do, where are you going, what's

02:31:48.943 --> 02:31:50.989
the plan? Orly needs something.

02:31:50.989 --> 02:31:59.784
SAM: Yeah, we've got to show-- maybe this jogs
Orly's memory. Orly-- why am I showing this to

02:31:59.784 --> 02:32:05.591
you, but here, here's a piece of a map we
retrieved! We'd like to go there. But keep it

02:32:05.591 --> 02:32:09.212
secret from the rest of the crew.

02:32:09.212 --> 02:32:16.568
LAURA: Is that the Inky Claw Reef?

02:32:16.568 --> 02:32:30.898
MATT: He compares it with the map and goes,
"B-b-est I can tell, it's probably close to the

02:32:30.898 --> 02:32:32.943
"Inky Claw, you know?"

02:32:33.224 --> 02:32:34.793
SAM: Oh, you were right, Fjord!

02:32:34.793 --> 02:32:37.789
TRAVIS: You're off the boat.

02:32:37.789 --> 02:32:39.164
MATT: "What?"

02:32:39.164 --> 02:32:41.353
MARISHA: Take your gold and leave.

02:32:41.353 --> 02:32:44.022
TALIESIN: Why do they call it the Inky Claw?

02:32:44.022 --> 02:32:46.119
TRAVIS: Why do they call it the Inky Claw?

02:32:46.119 --> 02:32:54.686
MATT: From what you know, partially because the
waters around there are very murky and very dark,

02:32:54.686 --> 02:33:00.428
so it's hard to see where the reef comes close to
the surface. A lot of the sea creatures that live

02:33:00.428 --> 02:33:05.143
in the area tend to knock a lot of the silt up,
that's close to the bottom of the reef, which

02:33:05.143 --> 02:33:10.547
means sometimes the reef sneaks up on you and
rakes across the bottom of the ship itself.

02:33:10.547 --> 02:33:16.799
TRAVIS: Because we have this map, and we have a
navigator, that doesn't mean that we can go from

02:33:16.799 --> 02:33:20.697
one destination on a map that we saw to another.
We still need to follow the trade routes, right?

02:33:20.697 --> 02:33:31.203
MATT: You can, it just means that-- anything
that's off the trade routes means there is not a

02:33:31.203 --> 02:33:37.248
lot of patrolling Zhelezo ships to maintain
protection for people that are using those lanes.

02:33:37.248 --> 02:33:44.283
It also means that sometimes, as you've heard,
certain creatures that live in the ocean or

02:33:44.283 --> 02:33:47.878
nearby, you're a little more susceptible to, but
it's a quicker route if where you're heading is

02:33:48.250 --> 02:33:50.113
the Inky Claw?

02:33:50.113 --> 02:33:52.449
LIAM: Roads. It's just like roads. Off roading it
or roading it?

02:33:52.449 --> 02:33:57.874
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it looks like there's not a
main trade route.

02:33:57.874 --> 02:34:03.379
TRAVIS: Yeah, if we stay on the trade route, we
have to go here, and then down, and then come

02:34:03.379 --> 02:34:06.755
across, or we go here.

02:34:06.755 --> 02:34:08.774
LAURA: Let's off-road it!

02:34:08.774 --> 02:34:10.704
TALIESIN: As the crow swims.

02:34:10.704 --> 02:34:12.784
SAM: (laughs) As the crow swims?

02:34:12.784 --> 02:34:15.207
TRAVIS: (laughs) Do crows swim?

02:34:15.207 --> 02:34:17.097
LIAM: Sure.

02:34:17.097 --> 02:34:19.564
MATT: You're telling Orly to head to where?

02:34:19.564 --> 02:34:24.329
TRAVIS: Well, I want to make everyone aware of the
dangers, okay. If we take the trade route, it will

02:34:24.329 --> 02:34:32.510
take three and a half times longer to get there
than if we just go from Point A to Point B. But

02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:38.324
Point A goes across uncharted waters, and on this
map there are giant tentacles coming out of the

02:34:38.324 --> 02:34:41.244
water, probably just for flavor.

02:34:41.244 --> 02:34:43.904
LAURA: I told you, sea monsters!

02:34:43.914 --> 02:34:47.900
TRAVIS: Could just be artist's interpretation, to
try and fill in blank space, doesn't mean anything.

02:34:48.298 --> 02:34:49.960
LIAM: There's tentacles on the map?

02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:55.685
LAURA: I can't tell anything about what's
happening here. Port Damali. Nicodranas.

02:34:55.685 --> 02:34:59.510
TRAVIS: Nicodranas, and the Inkclaw is down to
your lower right hand corner.

02:34:59.510 --> 02:35:02.177
SAM: Those could just be vines.

02:35:02.177 --> 02:35:03.711
TALIESIN: Literally can't tell what that is.

02:35:03.711 --> 02:35:05.271
MATT: Sea vines.

02:35:05.271 --> 02:35:07.487
TRAVIS: They're like little sea cucumbers.

02:35:07.487 --> 02:35:09.404
LIAM: TGIF flair, is all that is.

02:35:09.404 --> 02:35:15.838
TRAVIS: We also have this map, which is at the top
of the Inkclaw Reef, that will guide us through

02:35:15.838 --> 02:35:21.892
the reef. Instead of coming this direction and
then down and underneath, which is what you would

02:35:21.892 --> 02:35:23.468
probably be doing.

02:35:23.468 --> 02:35:25.257
LAURA: Let's do it!

02:35:25.257 --> 02:35:27.543
TRAVIS: All right. We'll instruct Orly--

02:35:27.543 --> 02:35:33.946
SAM: Not only will we do it, we will do it in
solidarity with you and your quest, because

02:35:33.946 --> 02:35:40.238
we are a team! A cohesive unit that acts as one!
When one member wants something, we all want

02:35:40.238 --> 02:35:43.013
something, right guys?

02:35:43.013 --> 02:35:50.553
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, of course. We are The Mighty Nein, not to
be trifled with. Welcome to The Mighty Nein, Caduceus.

02:35:50.553 --> 02:35:51.880
SAM: Put it in!

02:35:52.078 --> 02:35:53.937
TRAVIS: Put what in? The map?

02:35:53.937 --> 02:35:56.445
LIAM: No, she means your hands.

02:35:56.445 --> 02:35:58.873
MARISHA: Both hands, or just one?

02:35:58.873 --> 02:36:00.485
LAURA: And Yasha!

02:36:00.485 --> 02:36:02.944
MATT: Yasha puts one hand in as well.

02:36:02.944 --> 02:36:04.589
SAM: On three, ocean. One, two, three!

02:36:04.589 --> 02:36:06.403
ALL: Ocean!

02:36:06.403 --> 02:36:09.996
TRAVIS: Is that a goblin thing?

02:36:09.996 --> 02:36:12.005
SAM: Now it's a--

02:36:12.005 --> 02:36:14.737
LAURA and SAM: It's a Mighty Nein thing!

02:36:14.737 --> 02:36:17.655
MARISHA: Yeah! We have a thing.

02:36:17.655 --> 02:36:18.403
SAM: It's a new thing.

02:36:18.403 --> 02:36:25.618
TRAVIS: We're going to instruct Orly to navigate
from north to south to the top of the reef, using this.

02:36:25.673 --> 02:36:34.067
MATT: Orly corresponds and is like, "Just out of
personal curiosity, why are we heading through the

02:36:34.067 --> 02:36:37.430
"reef? Where are we going?"

02:36:37.699 --> 02:36:46.216
TRAVIS: We are trying to catch up with a captain
that we need to make contact with.

02:36:46.216 --> 02:36:58.333
MATT: "All right. Well, this captain you're talking
about m-m-may be where that 'X' is on the paper?"

02:36:58.333 --> 02:37:01.975
TRAVIS: I think they might, yep.

02:37:01.975 --> 02:37:06.391
MATT: "So that's putting us right by the island."

02:37:06.391 --> 02:37:08.513
LAURA: Which island?

02:37:08.513 --> 02:37:13.616
MATT: He points to, just on the outskirts of the
'X', the land mass.

02:37:13.616 --> 02:37:15.584
LAURA: Oh, that island.

02:37:15.584 --> 02:37:20.777
MATT: "According to my map right here, that is
Urukayxl."

02:37:20.777 --> 02:37:25.535
TRAVIS and SAM: Urukayxl?

02:37:25.535 --> 02:37:30.229
LAURA: I see it, yes, I see this map.

02:37:30.729 --> 02:37:36.522
MATT: "That's a real avoided locale."

02:37:36.522 --> 02:37:38.359
LAURA: Why?

02:37:38.359 --> 02:37:49.262
MATT: "Superstition. Many folks around here, they
talk about the dark stories of dense jungle and

02:37:49.262 --> 02:38:04.019
"very dangerous, iron-bearing creatures. They talk
of strange, ancient m-m-masses, and they talk of

02:38:04.019 --> 02:38:08.307
"wild, unnatural types."

02:38:08.307 --> 02:38:14.040
LIAM: Could it just be talk? For instance, there
is a rumor of a ghost girl on the docks back in

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:17.017
the Menagerie Coast we heard circulating.

02:38:17.017 --> 02:38:26.909
MATT: "Not too familiar with that one, but it's
possible. Mind you, I'm the navigator, I ain't

02:38:26.909 --> 02:38:31.179
"getting off the ship, so that's all up to you."

02:38:31.179 --> 02:38:33.682
LAURA: Have you ever heard of the Silver Silt
Palace?

02:38:33.682 --> 02:38:37.527
MATT: "Can't say I have."

02:38:37.527 --> 02:38:39.538
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

02:38:39.538 --> 02:38:43.371
TRAVIS: Caduceus, are you excited about these
haunted stories?

02:38:43.371 --> 02:38:50.666
TALIESIN: I mean, I guess, I don't know. I hadn't
really thought about it.

02:38:50.666 --> 02:38:55.477
LAURA: Hey look, it could be the path leading us
to more dead people, yeah?

02:38:55.477 --> 02:39:10.539
TALIESIN: I guess. I don't know, I'm trying to
reevaluate my expectations, I suppose. But we have

02:39:10.539 --> 02:39:17.088
a direction, we have a place to go, and stories
are stories.

02:39:17.088 --> 02:39:23.902
LIAM: This thing that you want to do, this mission--
I'm sorry, I overheard last night-- is there a

02:39:23.902 --> 02:39:30.555
place that it needs to happen, or is it something
that you will do wherever you go on the road?

02:39:31.077 --> 02:39:41.144
TALIESIN: I didn't really think it through, I
hadn't really-- I thought it would be easier to

02:39:41.144 --> 02:39:43.346
figure out.

02:39:43.346 --> 02:39:47.556
MARISHA: Caduceus, do you actually even know what
you're looking for?

02:39:47.556 --> 02:39:50.244
TALIESIN: A sign.

02:39:50.244 --> 02:39:59.078
MARISHA: So you came with us because we thought we
were a sign?

02:39:59.078 --> 02:40:01.317
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:40:01.317 --> 02:40:03.197
MARISHA: And now you're looking for the next
sign.

02:40:03.197 --> 02:40:06.742
TALIESIN: Well, when you say it out loud--

02:40:06.742 --> 02:40:10.395
TRAVIS: Whereas he still hasn't found what he's
looking for.

02:40:10.395 --> 02:40:17.249
MATT: Yasha actually approaches from the side,
overhearing the conversation, looks up to you,

02:40:17.249 --> 02:40:33.712
Caduceus, and goes, "I know what it's like to be
looking for some meaning. Some guidance.

02:40:33.712 --> 02:40:40.197
"Do you trust in your visions?"

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:48.569
TALIESIN: I did. I-- yeah.

02:40:48.569 --> 02:41:01.740
MATT: "And you have strong faith in this thing you
follow?"

02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:03.849
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:41:03.849 --> 02:41:19.853
MATT: "Then if you ever go off the path, maybe
they'll tell you. You just have to keep looking."

02:41:19.853 --> 02:41:27.668
TALIESIN: Well, that's fair. I hadn't really
thought about that.

02:41:27.668 --> 02:41:32.168
MATT: "It's kind of new to myself as well."

02:41:32.168 --> 02:41:42.818
TALIESIN: We're heading towards an island. I've
heard stories. Let's go to the island.

02:41:42.818 --> 02:41:47.254
MATT: As you guys are--

02:41:47.254 --> 02:41:54.185
MARISHA: When we fully get out of the reach of the
land, by the way, as we're sailing away, I just

02:41:54.185 --> 02:42:03.363
want to keep an eye out on the horizon and be
like: Professor! See if I see him.

02:42:03.363 --> 02:42:06.313
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:42:06.313 --> 02:42:09.444
MARISHA: I throw some dead pigeon or seagull in
the air.

02:42:09.444 --> 02:42:12.215
TRAVIS: Never has there been a more worthless
perception check.

02:42:12.215 --> 02:42:15.042
MARISHA: Nope. Seven.

02:42:15.042 --> 02:42:22.236
MATT: No sign of the Professor. You do have-- what
is it, Sprinkle? Sprinkle is still nestled up next

02:42:22.236 --> 02:42:30.643
to you. However your blink puppy, Nugget, still
remains with Marion back in Nicodranas.

02:42:30.643 --> 02:42:33.944
LAURA: I want to send a message to her before we
go to sleep tonight.

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:36.491
TRAVIS: To Nugget or your mom?

02:42:36.491 --> 02:42:38.225
LAURA: To my mama.

02:42:38.225 --> 02:42:41.395
MATT: Okay. All right. The evening comes quick; by
the time you guys are leaving, it's not that far

02:42:41.395 --> 02:42:45.827
from dusk, and so your first evening out on your
new trajectory, you have time. What do you want to

02:42:45.827 --> 02:42:47.592
send to Marion?

02:42:47.592 --> 02:42:55.884
LAURA: Mama, stuff happened at the docks and we
had to leave very quickly. Please take care of

02:42:55.884 --> 02:43:04.550
Nugget for a while. We'll be back, I promise. You
may have heard about the little girl who was

02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:06.902
killing herself on the dock--

02:43:06.935 --> 02:43:09.989
MATT: Are you using this across multiple spells?

02:43:09.989 --> 02:43:18.573
LAURA: Yes, this is my second message. My second
message: that looked like me but it wasn't me,

02:43:18.573 --> 02:43:22.628
don't worry, I'm very much alive, and I love you
very much, and I'll be home soon.

02:43:22.628 --> 02:43:24.367
LIAM: Beep!

02:43:24.367 --> 02:43:30.312
MATT: She doesn't have the chance to respond to
the first one, because you go right through to the

02:43:30.312 --> 02:43:38.703
second, but Marion does respond to the second and
goes, "Oh! Well, thank you for letting me know,

02:43:38.703 --> 02:43:55.838
"Jester. Be safe, be bright, and make me proud. And
come back soon. You and your friends. Goodbye!"

02:43:55.838 --> 02:44:07.042
All right, who's keeping watch the first evening?
Because now, with a full crew, you can go full

02:44:07.042 --> 02:44:12.369
pace on this longship, which will put you about 72
miles per day. It's about a 250 nautical mile

02:44:12.369 --> 02:44:19.289
trip, including through the reef, with a full
crew. That means it'll put you there in a little

02:44:19.289 --> 02:44:23.245
over three days, about three and a half, maybe
four days with careful passage through the reef.

02:44:23.245 --> 02:44:32.300
For the evening, who's watch? Okay. And you have
crew who can take up as well, if you want to. So

02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:36.237
one of you or both of you, make a perception
check.

02:44:36.237 --> 02:44:38.507
LAURA: Want both of us to do it?

02:44:38.507 --> 02:44:44.234
TRAVIS: Sure. Ten.

02:44:44.234 --> 02:44:46.242
LAURA: 15.

02:44:46.242 --> 02:44:57.123
MATT: 15? Okay. During the evening, you keep an
eye on the waves. At some point, the moon itself

02:44:57.123 --> 02:45:01.925
is starting to find itself low in the sky, and you
look over and you see this faint glow in the water

02:45:01.925 --> 02:45:09.663
below. You feel the back of your neck get warm for
a second and you glance over to try and inspect

02:45:09.663 --> 02:45:17.091
what the source of this light is. It's a jellyfish
bloom. You see hundreds and hundreds of these tiny

02:45:17.091 --> 02:45:25.697
jellyfish below the surface that are giving this
faint bioluminescent blues and pinks and variety

02:45:25.697 --> 02:45:32.840
of colors in that pastel spectrum. They pass under
the waves as you move by and you look out beyond

02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:39.253
that and you can see a few more. For the next hour
or so, you look over the water and pass by these

02:45:39.253 --> 02:45:45.206
beautiful little beacons of color in the middle of
this dark black ocean.

02:45:45.206 --> 02:45:48.438
LAURA: Fjord, have you ever seen anything like
this before?

02:45:48.438 --> 02:45:50.573
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:45:50.573 --> 02:45:51.883
LAURA: Really?

02:45:51.883 --> 02:45:53.955
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're beautiful.

02:45:53.955 --> 02:45:56.655
LAURA: Yeah. I've never seen anything like this.

02:45:56.655 --> 02:46:00.049
TRAVIS: Last thing you want to is jump in there,
though. That is a bad time.

02:46:00.049 --> 02:46:02.599
LAURA: Really?

02:46:02.599 --> 02:46:04.732
TRAVIS: Yeah, jellyfish sting and it's quite
painful.

02:46:04.732 --> 02:46:08.823
LAURA: Sometimes things that are the most
beautiful are the things that can hurt you the

02:46:08.823 --> 02:46:18.179
worst. Are you worried about where we're going?

02:46:18.179 --> 02:46:34.436
TRAVIS: No. No, I'm more anxious to get there. My
curiosity, I suppose, overrides my fear.

02:46:34.436 --> 02:46:41.425
LAURA: That's good. You're not afraid that this
captain is going to hurt you?

02:46:41.425 --> 02:46:52.523
TRAVIS: No, I don't think I had gotten that far.
Plus, I have the sphere. Captain Avantika doesn't.

02:46:52.523 --> 02:46:54.515
LAURA: That's true.

02:46:54.515 --> 02:46:57.171
TRAVIS: I feel like we take care of ourselves
pretty well.

02:46:57.171 --> 02:47:00.477
LAURA: Yeah. I promise I'll heal you if you start
to hurt, okay?

02:47:00.477 --> 02:47:03.800
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:10.932
LAURA: You're welcome. Do you ever get sad?

02:47:10.932 --> 02:47:13.856
TRAVIS: Sad?

02:47:13.856 --> 02:47:18.998
LAURA: Yeah, that sometimes things don't work out
the way you were hoping?

02:47:18.998 --> 02:47:33.085
TRAVIS: Yeah. I suppose I get sad. Are you sad,
Jester?

02:47:33.085 --> 02:47:41.215
LAURA: Only sometimes, but it passes really
quickly.

02:47:41.215 --> 02:47:55.782
TRAVIS: I'm sometimes sad about the things that I
had before, that I won't have anymore. I sometimes

02:47:55.782 --> 02:48:01.540
wish that things were different. What makes you
sad?

02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:10.982
LAURA: I miss my mama already. I thought we could
see her longer.

02:48:10.982 --> 02:48:23.050
TRAVIS: I am sorry that we left in the way that we
did. Would your mom ever think of leaving Nicodranas?

02:48:23.382 --> 02:48:34.431
LAURA: I don't know. She thought about it one time
with my dad. She was planning to leave with him,

02:48:34.431 --> 02:48:38.087
but then he never came back.

02:48:38.087 --> 02:48:45.486
TRAVIS: Right. What would you want for her? To
stay there and grow old or--?

02:48:45.486 --> 02:49:05.818
LAURA: I would like for her to be happy. I would
like for him to love her. I don't know. I would

02:49:05.818 --> 02:49:08.369
like for her to not have to work anymore.

02:49:08.369 --> 02:49:13.361
TRAVIS: That's very noble of you. Yeah.

02:49:13.361 --> 02:49:16.751
LAURA: I'm pretty noble.

02:49:16.751 --> 02:49:22.966
TRAVIS: Well, how about on some of these islands
I've heard that there is treasure.

02:49:22.966 --> 02:49:26.101
LAURA: Oh really?

02:49:26.101 --> 02:49:32.266
TRAVIS: Hard to find. I'm not making any promises,
but if we play our cards right and we take care of

02:49:32.266 --> 02:49:35.790
each other, we might return a bit wealthier than
we left.

02:49:35.790 --> 02:49:42.820
LAURA: This is a pretty good plan. Then we can use
that money to bribe The Gentleman to go back and

02:49:42.820 --> 02:49:46.204
woo my mama again.

02:49:46.204 --> 02:49:52.235
TRAVIS: Or give it to your mom and have her go
find The Gentleman, but she's just amazing.

02:49:52.235 --> 02:49:54.292
LAURA: That could work, too.

02:49:54.292 --> 02:50:01.677
TRAVIS: Yeah. Don't be sad. Your mom is very proud
of you, that much was clear.

02:50:01.677 --> 02:50:07.532
LAURA: Yeah. Thanks, Fjord.

02:50:07.532 --> 02:50:09.560
TRAVIS: Don't mention it.

02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:17.849
MATT: The remainder of the evening goes thankfully
uneventful. The blooms fade as you pass through

02:50:17.849 --> 02:50:26.471
the evening mating grounds of these jellyfish. The
next day comes, the morning comes, and your first

02:50:26.471 --> 02:50:33.601
true on-the-ocean breakfast kicks in. Thankfully,
because of supplies that were purchased, there are

02:50:33.601 --> 02:50:39.860
a number of fresh meats available. A proper
breakfast can be made. You can see through the

02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:45.057
crew that you've hired, they're quite surprised by
the quality of food they're given on this journey.

02:50:45.057 --> 02:50:50.607
There's a bit of like a, "Damn, now I'm glad I
agreed to this journey." They take some food and a

02:50:50.607 --> 02:50:51.737
couple of them are like--

02:50:51.737 --> 02:50:55.319
TRAVIS: They decided not to kill us.

02:50:55.319 --> 02:50:56.824
LIAM: Mutiny!

02:50:56.824 --> 02:50:58.685
TALIESIN: There are vegetarian options as well.

02:50:58.685 --> 02:51:02.365
LIAM: "Wow, this quinoa's pretty good!"

02:51:02.365 --> 02:51:06.583
TALIESIN: That's all I wanted, I can die happy
now.

02:51:06.583 --> 02:51:09.378
MATT: Hilariously, Marius is actually a
vegetarian.

02:51:09.378 --> 02:51:11.084
TALIESIN: Perfect.

02:51:11.084 --> 02:51:12.656
TRAVIS: Of course he is.

02:51:12.656 --> 02:51:16.475
MATT: He is! He's like, "I'll probably partake in
that, too, if that's all right?"

02:51:16.475 --> 02:51:18.008
TALIESIN: No, please.

02:51:18.008 --> 02:51:20.179
MATT: "This is delicious."

02:51:20.179 --> 02:51:22.184
TALIESIN: Thank you, I'm very proud of this.
Family recipe.

02:51:22.184 --> 02:51:23.604
MATT: "They're crazy, aren't they?"

02:51:23.634 --> 02:51:25.972
TALIESIN: Completely crazy. Bonkers.

02:51:25.972 --> 02:51:28.570
MATT: "What's going to happen, are they going to
let me go, you think?"

02:51:28.570 --> 02:51:34.234
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. I mean, probably. I don't know.
I mean, I'm just barely attached on to this at

02:51:34.234 --> 02:51:36.098
this point, but I think you're fine.

02:51:36.346 --> 02:51:40.571
MATT: "If worst comes to worst, we cut and run,
huh? You and me?"

02:51:40.571 --> 02:51:45.828
TALIESIN: Worst comes to worst, I'll make sure you
can cut and run. I think I'm stuck here for a

02:51:45.828 --> 02:51:49.001
while, but I'll make sure you can bugger out if
you need to.

02:51:49.001 --> 02:51:51.670
MATT: "Okay, thanks."

02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:53.648
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:51:53.648 --> 02:51:54.977
MATT: "Once again, very good."

02:51:54.977 --> 02:51:56.747
TALIESIN: I have no idea what just happened.

02:51:56.747 --> 02:52:00.115
MATT: Continuing on your journey, who's keeping
watch for this next day?

02:52:00.115 --> 02:52:02.407
MARISHA: I'll go.

02:52:02.407 --> 02:52:07.487
MATT: All right, so either you guys roll individually
or one of you with advantage, your choice.

02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:08.968
MARISHA: Individually, yeah?

02:52:08.968 --> 02:52:10.546
MATT: Go for it.

02:52:10.546 --> 02:52:11.955
MARISHA: Perception?

02:52:11.955 --> 02:52:12.845
MATT: Yeah.

02:52:12.845 --> 02:52:14.264
TRAVIS: Nice. Solid.

02:52:14.264 --> 02:52:15.754
MARISHA: Natural one.

02:52:15.754 --> 02:52:17.280
LIAM: 17.

02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:18.669
MATT: 17? Okay, good.

02:52:18.669 --> 02:52:21.914
SAM: Marisha, you have to give $100 to 826LA.

02:52:21.914 --> 02:52:27.364
LAURA: Oh my god, can you imagine? We would be so
broke.

02:52:27.364 --> 02:52:34.753
SAM: Every time we roll a one, we have to donate
$100 from our own wallets.

02:52:34.753 --> 02:52:41.803
MATT: Okay, since Orly is the navigator, helping
you out and are you leading this-- are you guiding

02:52:41.803 --> 02:52:43.593
the boat, are you the captain of this?

02:52:43.593 --> 02:52:44.911
LAURA: You're the captain, just take it.

02:52:45.270 --> 02:52:49.599
MATT: You didn't hire a captain and they need to
be hired by somebody, so one of you needs to be

02:52:49.599 --> 02:52:51.528
the captain.

02:52:51.528 --> 02:52:53.449
LAURA: You're the captain. Captain Fjord!

02:52:53.449 --> 02:52:57.931
MATT: You generally don't hire a captain for the
ship, like hey, we're just a bunch of assholes

02:52:57.931 --> 02:53:01.617
with a boat! We need to hire someone to be our
leader and pay us.

02:53:01.617 --> 02:53:06.062
TRAVIS: I saw, right next to the cut your own keys
booth next to the dock, there was a

02:53:06.062 --> 02:53:13.304
rent-a-captain. He would sit there with a corncob
pipe and he's like, "Argh, me is a--"

02:53:13.304 --> 02:53:16.338
TALIESIN: You didn't download the app, though,
didn't you, so you didn't hire him.

02:53:16.338 --> 02:53:18.854
MARISHA: Yeah, that's just a photo opportunity.

02:53:18.854 --> 02:53:20.637
MATT: What's your captain name, to your crew?

02:53:20.637 --> 02:53:22.361
TRAVIS: My captain name?

02:53:22.361 --> 02:53:27.269
MATT: They need to have to know who their captain
is, who they're going to go towards.

02:53:27.269 --> 02:53:32.023
TRAVIS: Captain... Captain Tusktooth.

02:53:32.023 --> 02:53:39.861
MATT: Captain Tusktooth. There we go. They're very
confused because there are no tusks visible on Tusktooth.

02:53:40.086 --> 02:53:41.906
TRAVIS: Nope. You never want to see them.

02:53:41.906 --> 02:53:47.387
MATT: Good to know, Captain Tusktooth. All righty.

02:53:47.387 --> 02:53:52.078
LIAM: The perception check was for at night during
a shift?

02:53:52.078 --> 02:53:54.481
MATT: No, this was throughout the day.

02:53:54.481 --> 02:53:56.164
LIAM: All throughout the whole day, okay.

02:53:56.204 --> 02:54:01.811
MATT: The crew's keeping watch, too, but this is
keen eyes and occasionally going up to-- climbing

02:54:01.811 --> 02:54:05.674
the sail a bit to get a good view, or climbing the
mast to keep an eye out.

02:54:05.674 --> 02:54:10.338
MARISHA: I'm leaning on the edge and I just go:
Caleb, this is boring. It's just blue.

02:54:10.338 --> 02:54:12.680
LAURA: I'm blue!

02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:15.572
MARISHA: Jester's more interesting to look at.

02:54:15.572 --> 02:54:20.765
MATT: Roll a survival check with advantage for
Orly's help as the navigator. To keep us on task

02:54:20.765 --> 02:54:22.774
and in the proper direction.

02:54:22.774 --> 02:54:25.139
LIAM: Could we say that Beau and--

02:54:25.139 --> 02:54:26.279
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:54:26.279 --> 02:54:30.491
MATT: You're going to pick up some speed,
actually.

02:54:30.491 --> 02:54:33.245
LIAM: Look at Fjord. He is the captain now.

02:54:33.245 --> 02:54:42.903
MATT: Captain Tusktooth already, out of the gate,
acting like a captain and the crew's coming

02:54:42.903 --> 02:54:49.009
together. For all of you who watched the fuckery
that was you trying to get out and then back to

02:54:49.009 --> 02:54:53.477
port the night before, seeing a full crew on the
ship knowing what they're doing, you're like "Oh."

02:54:53.477 --> 02:54:57.712
Yeah. It's probably good you hired this crew.

02:54:57.712 --> 02:55:00.306
TRAVIS: Lower the inboard motor! Fire at--

02:55:00.306 --> 02:55:03.875
LIAM: One quick thing.

02:55:03.875 --> 02:55:06.860
MATT: Yes.

02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:19.212
LIAM: You know, I want to thank you. You could
have told any of these people anything about me

02:55:19.212 --> 02:55:20.652
and you have not.

02:55:20.652 --> 02:55:25.484
MARISHA: No. Don't give me that much credit yet, I
still could.

02:55:25.484 --> 02:55:31.403
LIAM: I know. You have every right to. I hope you
don't. I don't know how all of them would handle

02:55:31.403 --> 02:55:37.174
it. Be that as it may, I have something for you.

02:55:37.174 --> 02:55:38.564
MARISHA: What?

02:55:38.564 --> 02:55:46.274
LIAM: I bring Frumpkin out in his new speckled elf
owl form, which is the smallest owl on the planet.

02:55:46.274 --> 02:55:47.461
He weighs one ounce.

02:55:47.461 --> 02:55:51.216
TRAVIS: Really, one ounce?

02:55:51.216 --> 02:55:52.778
MATT: Oh no!

02:55:52.778 --> 02:55:54.826
LAURA: Like the famous little owl with the star
eyes?

02:55:54.826 --> 02:55:58.595
LIAM: The tiniest little owl that ever existed.
This is a loaner.

02:55:58.595 --> 02:56:00.200
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:02.126
LIAM: You can have him for roughly a week.

02:56:02.126 --> 02:56:04.891
MARISHA: He doesn't look as angry as Professor
Thaddeus.

02:56:04.891 --> 02:56:10.927
LIAM: No, this is the way owls are supposed to be.
I place him. He's going to listen to you.

02:56:10.927 --> 02:56:12.476
MARISHA: Is he?

02:56:12.476 --> 02:56:14.188
LIAM: Yeah.

02:56:14.188 --> 02:56:16.093
MARISHA: I poke him and see if he bites me.

02:56:16.093 --> 02:56:18.279
SAM: He's dead.

02:56:18.279 --> 02:56:20.861
MATT: Every time!

02:56:20.861 --> 02:56:22.907
MARISHA: Everything that I touch!

02:56:22.907 --> 02:56:26.386
TRAVIS: One ounce! One inch punch!

02:56:26.386 --> 02:56:30.344
MATT: It is technically a monk weapon, the index
finger.

02:56:30.344 --> 02:56:34.520
MARISHA: My hands are registered weapons!

02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:47.903
LIAM: A couple rules. He will listen to you. Will
you listen, Frumpkin? Frumpkin nods. Okay. If you

02:56:47.903 --> 02:56:55.291
need to get him out of danger in a hurry, you
say "split." That's what it will take. You'll need

02:56:55.291 --> 02:57:01.779
me to bring him back, but if he's in danger and
you want to keep him for your week loaner, you say

02:57:01.779 --> 02:57:06.952
split. Okay? He's yours. Thank you. Yeah?

02:57:06.952 --> 02:57:11.669
MARISHA: Thanks, Caleb. Thank you.

02:57:11.669 --> 02:57:16.670
MATT: Your guys' day shift goes by, keeping watch.
Nothing really catches your attention; it's just

02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:22.088
open shores and open waters. Since you're off the
trade route path, there don't appear to be any

02:57:22.098 --> 02:57:30.248
other ships passing back and forth. It feels
comforting to be so alone in some ways, but for

02:57:30.248 --> 02:57:34.693
some of you, it's strangely isolating. There may
be a few moments throughout the next few days

02:57:34.703 --> 02:57:39.514
where you have to go below deck and not
conjecture, you especially, Caduceus. This is--

02:57:39.514 --> 02:57:42.930
TALIESIN: I'm good in my head.

02:57:42.930 --> 02:57:49.049
MATT: Day two and day three start getting a little
hard on you to-- we've been traveling for 48 hours

02:57:49.049 --> 02:57:51.939
and literally everything looks exactly the same.

02:57:51.939 --> 02:57:54.779
TALIESIN: I'm going to start probably talking to
fish at some point in the near future.

02:57:54.842 --> 02:58:04.008
MATT: Okay. For the evening's watch on the second
day, or this is technically the end of the first day.

02:58:04.008 --> 02:58:06.439
SAM: I'll take a watch.

02:58:06.439 --> 02:58:07.763
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

02:58:07.763 --> 02:58:09.749
MATT: Both of you guys roll for your perception.

02:58:09.749 --> 02:58:13.215
SAM: Six-- nine!

02:58:13.215 --> 02:58:15.203
TALIESIN: 15.

02:58:15.261 --> 02:58:24.190
MATT: 15, okay. You continue on through the
evening, uneventful.

02:58:24.190 --> 02:58:31.753
SAM: Want any booze? Oh, you don't drink.

02:58:31.753 --> 02:58:33.529
TALIESIN: I don't drink.

02:58:33.529 --> 02:58:35.469
SAM: Mind if I drink?

02:58:35.469 --> 02:58:37.717
TALIESIN: Not at all.

02:58:37.717 --> 02:58:38.924
SAM: All right.

02:58:38.924 --> 02:58:43.399
TALIESIN: Out of idle curiosity, why have you been
trying to butter me up?

02:58:43.399 --> 02:58:53.612
SAM: Well, you joined us a little late in our
adventures, but many of us-- not me, of course--

02:58:53.612 --> 02:59:05.988
but many of us were maybe outcasts or whatever
before. Over the course of spending some time

02:59:05.988 --> 02:59:13.555
together and traveling and doing some good things,
mostly good things, but a few bad things together,

02:59:13.555 --> 02:59:23.530
we've come to rely on each other and well, it
doesn't feel like we're outcasts as much anymore.

02:59:23.530 --> 02:59:34.652
Just trying to maintain that sense of a unit.
Because even though we've made some mistakes and

02:59:34.652 --> 02:59:43.710
we'll probably continue to, it feels like we're a
little bit better when we're together. This other

02:59:43.710 --> 03:00:05.768
fellow in the group, Mollymauk, he sort of showed
us that... by dying. I'm just trying to keep us together.

03:00:05.864 --> 03:00:08.068
TALIESIN: Well.

03:00:08.068 --> 03:00:10.787
SAM: We all have our own things, right? I'm sure
you have your own thing.

03:00:10.787 --> 03:00:14.440
TALIESIN: I do, and for the record, I'm on board
for now.

03:00:14.440 --> 03:00:16.316
SAM: That's good.

03:00:16.316 --> 03:00:19.511
TALIESIN: I'll keep your boy safe, that's okay.

03:00:19.511 --> 03:00:28.501
SAM: Thank you. He will definitely need lots of
healing on this island. Between you and me,

03:00:28.501 --> 03:00:40.751
Jester's a really bad cleric, so-- it'd be good if
you could just stick-- if I go right, you go left.

03:00:40.751 --> 03:00:43.573
You stick with Caleb.

03:00:43.573 --> 03:00:46.997
TALIESIN: I'm not an only child; I'm aware of how
this works.

03:00:46.997 --> 03:00:50.762
SAM: Okay. You have sisters and brothers?

03:00:50.762 --> 03:00:51.767
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:00:51.767 --> 03:00:55.510
SAM: Oh, that's right, you told us. You had a
large family, but they're all scattered about, right?

03:00:55.531 --> 03:00:57.654
TALIESIN: They're somewhere, I suppose.

03:00:57.905 --> 03:01:02.894
SAM: Are they trying to save your town? Is it a
town? Is it your home?

03:01:02.894 --> 03:01:07.268
TALIESIN: It's just the temple ground, that's all
there is to it.

03:01:07.268 --> 03:01:10.323
SAM: They're out there trying to find a solution
for whatever ails it?

03:01:10.323 --> 03:01:14.490
TALIESIN: That's why they left, yeah. That was the
thought.

03:01:14.490 --> 03:01:17.909
SAM: You've had no contact with them?

03:01:17.909 --> 03:01:20.808
TALIESIN: No. I was the last one left.

03:01:20.808 --> 03:01:24.921
SAM: Well, I hope no one breaks in.

03:01:24.921 --> 03:01:35.656
TALIESIN: Well, I've resigned myself to the thought
that it's entirely possible that someone will.

03:01:35.795 --> 03:01:48.966
SAM: I'm not a religious lady, but I will tell you
that, for me, this journey with this group has

03:01:48.966 --> 03:01:57.364
been a bit of a sign. I know that you're
questioning whether it was for you, but--

03:01:57.364 --> 03:02:01.464
TALIESIN: What kind of sign?

03:02:01.464 --> 03:02:14.230
SAM: A sign that there could be, for all of us,
another chapter.

03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:20.558
TALIESIN: Wow, I thought I had you figured out.
Never mind. All right.

03:02:20.558 --> 03:02:23.678
SAM: I'm going to drink now.

03:02:23.934 --> 03:02:36.893
MATT: (laughs) Finishing your watch, uneventful.
As the evening comes in, other folks can take a

03:02:36.893 --> 03:02:40.889
shift, or you can leave it to any of your crew.
You don't have to take every shift, but you have

03:02:40.889 --> 03:02:43.712
to rely on your crew to keep a watch.

03:02:43.712 --> 03:02:45.267
TALIESIN: NPCs!

03:02:45.267 --> 03:02:47.986
MATT: Any plans for the evening?

03:02:47.986 --> 03:02:55.729
TRAVIS: I'll take the last watch. Is it at night
at all?

03:02:55.729 --> 03:03:00.385
MATT: This would be night, yeah. You've been
captaining the ship for a full day.

03:03:00.385 --> 03:03:06.047
TALIESIN: Before I go to sleep, I'm going to
politely ask any of the fish and things that are

03:03:06.047 --> 03:03:11.151
in the ocean to let us know if there's trouble up
ahead. If they would be so kind.

03:03:11.151 --> 03:03:14.941
MATT: Okay. You get the sense that the fish would
be happy to, as they--

03:03:14.941 --> 03:03:18.436
TALIESIN: I'm a lunatic aren't I? There's just
no--

03:03:18.436 --> 03:03:20.381
MATT: No, it's great.

03:03:20.381 --> 03:03:23.596
TALIESIN: Okay, because I have a roll for this,
but I'm okay.

03:03:23.596 --> 03:03:29.713
MATT: You lean over the side of the boat and,
talking to the fish that pass by-- you get the

03:03:29.713 --> 03:03:34.197
sense that it's like, (chorus of fish) "Sure."

03:03:34.197 --> 03:03:37.922
(laughter)

03:03:37.922 --> 03:03:40.696
TRAVIS: You can talk to them, but they can't talk
back.

03:03:40.696 --> 03:03:46.707
MATT: They're nowhere near as fast as the ship, so
within the sphere of perception that a fish has,

03:03:46.707 --> 03:03:51.777
the ones that are now far behind you will definitely
let you know when you come across something.

03:03:51.828 --> 03:03:54.220
TALIESIN: I don't know that.

03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:57.928
MATT: I know. And I love playing that element.

03:03:57.928 --> 03:04:01.365
LAURA: (as a fish) Nice boat!

03:04:01.365 --> 03:04:06.151
TRAVIS: I'll hand off the wheel to someone and
I'll go down to the side of the ship and I'll

03:04:06.151 --> 03:04:07.927
summon the falchion.

03:04:07.927 --> 03:04:09.586
MATT: Okay.

03:04:09.586 --> 03:04:14.687
TRAVIS: With not a lot of people on the deck
paying attention, hopefully, can I reach over the

03:04:14.687 --> 03:04:18.288
side and dip the tip of the sword into the ocean?

03:04:18.288 --> 03:04:26.114
MATT: Sure. It drags through the water like any
other blade would.

03:04:26.114 --> 03:04:28.883
TRAVIS: Does the eye do anything?

03:04:28.883 --> 03:04:31.203
MATT: No, it doesn't react.

03:04:31.203 --> 03:04:34.614
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll summon it back.

03:04:34.614 --> 03:04:36.615
MATT: Okay. Falchion's back whence it came.

03:04:36.615 --> 03:04:39.448
TRAVIS: (quietly) From whence it came.

03:04:39.448 --> 03:04:41.932
MATT: Are you keeping watch?

03:04:41.932 --> 03:04:43.072
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:04:43.072 --> 03:04:45.087
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

03:04:45.087 --> 03:04:47.132
TRAVIS: Ooh, seven.

03:04:47.132 --> 03:04:59.781
MATT: Okay, nothing for the evening. Okay. As
you're focusing on your blade on the side of the

03:04:59.781 --> 03:05:09.795
boat, as it gets close to midnight-- let me
actually roll for the crew as well. Nope, okay. As

03:05:09.795 --> 03:05:23.700
you are checking your blade and looking around,
you hear this sound that catches your ear. It's

03:05:23.700 --> 03:05:36.053
like (rustling), but it's up. Glancing up to the
left of your vision, and there's a shape that's

03:05:36.053 --> 03:05:37.925
sitting up on one of the sails.

03:05:37.925 --> 03:05:42.815
LAURA: What the fuck? What is it?

03:05:42.815 --> 03:05:46.778
MATT: Just a dark shape sitting up there on the
sail.

03:05:46.832 --> 03:05:48.793
TRAVIS: Professor Thaddeus?

03:05:48.793 --> 03:05:52.082
MATT: It's not moving.

03:05:52.082 --> 03:05:53.908
LAURA: Oh god.

03:05:53.908 --> 03:05:57.612
MARISHA and LAURA: It's so spooky.

03:05:57.612 --> 03:05:59.489
TRAVIS: (whistle) I'll sound a general alarm.

03:05:59.489 --> 03:06:05.997
MATT: As you whistle, you see it has two wings,
and it-- and takes off into the dark night.

03:06:05.997 --> 03:06:10.815
SAM: What is it? What's going on?

03:06:10.815 --> 03:06:17.049
TRAVIS: There was something that took off from the
mast; it had wings.

03:06:17.049 --> 03:06:19.812
LAURA: Was it a parrot? I hear there's parrots on
pirate ships.

03:06:19.812 --> 03:06:22.071
TRAVIS: It was pretty large, right?

03:06:22.071 --> 03:06:24.619
MATT: It looked humanoid-ish.

03:06:24.619 --> 03:06:27.069
LAURA: Humanoid-ish?

03:06:27.069 --> 03:06:32.121
MATT: As far as size-wise, it looked like a human.
You saw big wings and you saw legs dangling. It

03:06:32.121 --> 03:06:35.284
looked like a bird, but it was human-sized.

03:06:35.284 --> 03:06:41.384
MARISHA: Where is Yasha? I go down; is Yasha still
sleeping, or is Yasha still here?

03:06:41.384 --> 03:06:47.417
MATT: Yasha's asleep. You go down and Yasha sits
up. As soon as you enter the room, the chamber

03:06:47.417 --> 03:06:48.865
that Yasha has--

03:06:48.865 --> 03:06:50.505
MARISHA: (shouting) Yasha, are you still here?

03:06:50.505 --> 03:06:53.195
MATT: Before you even get to that point, the sound
of the door opening, Yasha's like-- (panting).

03:06:53.195 --> 03:06:56.434
MARISHA: (shouting) Yasha's still here.

03:06:56.434 --> 03:07:08.378
MATT: "Be careful, Beau." Puts the blade and leans
it against the side of the cot and leans back.

03:07:08.378 --> 03:07:16.824
MARISHA: Just wanted to give you a quick update.
Fjord saw a thing with two wings, appeared to be

03:07:16.824 --> 03:07:19.883
humanoid, flying off the boat, and just wanted to
make sure--

03:07:19.883 --> 03:07:22.534
MATT: Grabs the sword and gets back up and walks
past you and up the stairs.

03:07:22.534 --> 03:07:24.093
MARISHA: (shouting) Yasha's coming.

03:07:24.093 --> 03:07:26.549
LAURA: What the fuck was it, Fjord?

03:07:26.549 --> 03:07:29.308
TRAVIS: I don't know. I didn't see, it's too
dark.

03:07:29.308 --> 03:07:36.140
MARISHA: I'm going to turn around and do a scan of
the horizon. Do I see anything?

03:07:36.140 --> 03:07:41.331
MATT: Perception check, with disadvantage, because
this is looking into far darkness.

03:07:41.331 --> 03:07:43.370
MARISHA: I'll put my goggles on just in casies.

03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:46.338
MATT: Just in casies, sure. But still at
disadvantage.

03:07:46.338 --> 03:07:50.089
MARISHA: Nine. Eight.

03:07:50.089 --> 03:07:55.805
MATT: Glancing out, it looks like-- at this point,
the moon is just starting to vanish in the

03:07:55.805 --> 03:08:01.247
distance, so there's not a lot of light, and it
looks like a black, endless void around the ship

03:08:01.247 --> 03:08:06.948
with just a faint image of a blue line as a
horizon in all directions.

03:08:06.948 --> 03:08:09.937
LAURA: Can I climb up to where it was and see if
it left anything behind?

03:08:09.937 --> 03:08:11.260
MATT: Sure.

03:08:11.260 --> 03:08:12.577
TRAVIS and SAM: Like some poop.

03:08:12.577 --> 03:08:14.722
LAURA: Like poop, or a feather, or--

03:08:14.722 --> 03:08:16.458
MATT: You make your way up. Go ahead and make an
investigation check.

03:08:16.458 --> 03:08:18.012
LAURA: A wallet.

03:08:18.012 --> 03:08:21.167
MARISHA: Look, personal identification.

03:08:21.167 --> 03:08:24.520
LAURA: 12.

03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:33.816
MATT: You look and you can see-- it's dry,
weathered wood; this mast has been in use for a

03:08:33.816 --> 03:08:37.824
while. You do see what appear to be some grooves,
like large talons.

03:08:37.824 --> 03:08:39.615
LAURA: It had claws.

03:08:39.615 --> 03:08:48.149
LIAM: Oh hey. Rub a little phosphorus on and--
send a globule of light 120 feet in every

03:08:48.149 --> 03:08:51.661
direction from the boat, four of them, to see if
there's anything.

03:08:51.661 --> 03:08:56.002
MATT: Okay. As the lights drift out, at that
moment, you watch as a series of shapes swoop in

03:08:56.002 --> 03:09:05.612
(squawking). In that instant, you watch as a
cluster of harpies-- not coming towards you-- are

03:09:05.612 --> 03:09:10.106
now coming in and dive-bombing the sails. They're
rushing in and trying to drag their claws through

03:09:10.106 --> 03:09:17.063
to put you dead in the water. From a narrative
standpoint, go ahead and roll initiative.

03:09:17.063 --> 03:09:19.173
MARISHA: Jesus.

03:09:19.173 --> 03:09:22.414
SAM: No, oh no. Laura asks a good question.

03:09:22.414 --> 03:09:26.466
LAURA: It was last campaign, Travis said.

03:09:26.466 --> 03:09:30.254
MARISHA: Here's my boots.

03:09:30.254 --> 03:09:32.211
MATT: All right. 25 to 20?

03:09:32.211 --> 03:09:33.464
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:09:33.464 --> 03:09:40.837
SAM: Oh, do you want someone to roll for Yasha?

03:09:40.837 --> 03:09:42.835
MATT: Oh, yeah.

03:09:42.835 --> 03:09:45.035
LIAM: Matt'll do it.

03:09:45.035 --> 03:09:47.091
MATT: Yeah, that's a 16.

03:09:47.091 --> 03:09:48.669
SAM: Whoa, best roll ever.

03:09:48.669 --> 03:09:51.901
MARISHA: That's because Ashley's not here to roll
initiative for herself. 20 for Beau.

03:09:51.901 --> 03:09:53.968
TALIESIN: Are we doing 25 to 20 still?

03:09:53.968 --> 03:09:56.061
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:56.061 --> 03:10:02.124
LIAM: We've been doing therapy talks for two and a
half hours, Matt has to wake up now. We're on combat.

03:10:02.124 --> 03:10:06.945
MATT: All right. 20 for Beau. 20 to 15?

03:10:06.945 --> 03:10:08.614
LAURA: 18.

03:10:08.614 --> 03:10:09.887
TALIESIN: 17.

03:10:09.887 --> 03:10:11.316
MATT: Ooh, look at that.

03:10:11.316 --> 03:10:13.328
TALIESIN: There we are.

03:10:13.328 --> 03:10:14.675
TRAVIS: Yasha had 16.

03:10:14.675 --> 03:10:17.540
MATT: Yep. Jester, Caduceus, Yasha. 15 to ten?

03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:19.048
TRAVIS and SAM: 11.

03:10:19.048 --> 03:10:23.814
LIAM: <i>Nein.</i> Oh no, I was saying no in German,
excuse me. I did not roll a nine.

03:10:23.814 --> 03:10:26.572
MATT: Nott, Fjord, and then Caleb, you're last?

03:10:26.572 --> 03:10:28.299
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Five.

03:10:28.299 --> 03:10:34.154
MATT: All right. Harpies rolled a natural 20 on
their initiative roll.

03:10:34.154 --> 03:10:35.878
SAM: Whoa.

03:10:35.881 --> 03:10:41.949
MATT: With their plus one, that's a 21, so they're
going first. You watch as six harpies come

03:10:41.949 --> 03:10:50.827
swooping in. Two of them land up on top and
getting a view of who all's on the ship. The few

03:10:50.827 --> 03:10:56.339
crew that are currently running the deck start
shouting, "Harpies!" and they start running.

03:10:56.339 --> 03:11:04.903
They're not hired to fight, and they go charging into
the cabin below. They're both looking towards the

03:11:04.903 --> 03:11:09.984
guys who are running and they're both going to swoop
down and see if they can go over to the deckhands.

03:11:09.984 --> 03:11:11.516
TRAVIS: Have they already slashed the sails?

03:11:11.813 --> 03:11:13.117
SAM: No! Not our crew!

03:11:13.117 --> 03:11:18.529
MATT: No, not yet. Those two haven't. One of
them's going to swoop down-- that's cocked. No,

03:11:18.529 --> 03:11:24.505
not with a six. Manages to try and harry the guy
and he kicks it off, manages to push through. The

03:11:24.505 --> 03:11:33.981
other one dives down to grab a second one. Does
manage to do so. Claws sink in, not doing a whole

03:11:33.981 --> 03:11:38.875
lot of damage, but you watch as it grips into and
begins lifting one of the deck hands. He's three

03:11:38.875 --> 03:11:42.626
or four feet off the ground, and he's like--
(yelling), and the harpy's lifting him up. Three

03:11:42.626 --> 03:11:51.565
of the others are going to tear through the sails,
and one of them is about to land on the poop deck

03:11:51.565 --> 03:11:56.217
on the back towards the stern of the ship. The
three are going to try to sweep across the sails.

03:11:56.217 --> 03:11:58.663
Yeah, that's a hit. That's a hit.

03:11:58.663 --> 03:12:02.296
LAURA: Fucker.

03:12:02.296 --> 03:12:06.916
MATT: That's a miss. One of them attempts to try
and grab towards the sail, but the way the wind is

03:12:06.916 --> 03:12:11.552
blowing, it can't actually get a hold of it and
only does a slight tear on the side. The other

03:12:11.552 --> 03:12:26.585
two, however, with their claws-- seven, 13 points
of damage to that sail. You hear the tearing sound

03:12:26.585 --> 03:12:34.719
as they both drag a series of open tears across
the central sail on the main mast. You watch as

03:12:34.719 --> 03:12:39.969
the sail-- (flapping) the ship's starting to slow
a little bit in that process. The one that lands

03:12:39.969 --> 03:12:49.268
in the back of the ship stops, wings out, inhales,
and this voice begins to emerge, this strange,

03:12:49.268 --> 03:12:59.578
baleful-- (singing)-- this weird, ghostly voice
that seems to emanate and then grow into its own

03:12:59.578 --> 03:13:06.982
chorus-- it's like a dirge, almost-- as it spreads
out into the space. I need everybody to make a

03:13:06.982 --> 03:13:09.107
wisdom saving throw.

03:13:09.107 --> 03:13:11.939
SAM: Ooh. Not my strength.

03:13:11.939 --> 03:13:13.591
MARISHA: Natural 20.

03:13:13.591 --> 03:13:14.725
MATT: Great.

03:13:14.725 --> 03:13:15.718
TRAVIS: 16.

03:13:15.718 --> 03:13:17.278
MATT: That's a success.

03:13:17.278 --> 03:13:18.073
LIAM: 16.

03:13:18.073 --> 03:13:19.147
MATT: Success.

03:13:19.147 --> 03:13:20.188
SAM: Eight.

03:13:20.188 --> 03:13:21.213
MATT: Fail.

03:13:21.213 --> 03:13:22.112
LAURA: 24.

03:13:22.112 --> 03:13:22.964
MATT: Success.

03:13:22.964 --> 03:13:24.060
TALIESIN: 17.

03:13:24.060 --> 03:13:26.884
MATT: Success. Roll for Yasha, if you don't mind.
One of you.

03:13:26.904 --> 03:13:28.471
SAM: 15 plus--

03:13:28.471 --> 03:13:35.367
MATT: Everyone succeeds. You hear this and you
feel this weird, faint grasp in your brain, this

03:13:35.407 --> 03:13:43.871
song beginning to placate your adrenaline, but
then you shrug it off, except for Nott. Nott, you

03:13:43.871 --> 03:13:50.925
are charmed by this harpy. You listen to this
music, and it's beautiful. You find yourself-- all

03:13:50.925 --> 03:13:59.667
the tension leaving your body, and you can't focus
on anything else. You're just watching it there.

03:13:59.667 --> 03:14:05.683
You guys watch as Nott's arms drop, her weapon
going limp to her side, her head turned slightly

03:14:05.683 --> 03:14:11.957
towards one shoulder and smiling, listening to
this song. One of the crew that's not currently

03:14:11.957 --> 03:14:17.537
being held by the harpy almost makes it into the
lower cabin, and then stops dead in his grasp and

03:14:17.537 --> 03:14:22.251
is also entranced by the song. The harpy continues
to sing. All right, Beau, you're up first.

03:14:22.251 --> 03:14:30.617
MARISHA: With a quick glance, does it look like
the sail is worth trying to save any further, or

03:14:30.617 --> 03:14:33.387
is it fucked? Just with a quick glance.

03:14:33.387 --> 03:14:40.807
MATT: No, the sail is not completely destroyed,
and it could be repaired, should they not continue

03:14:40.807 --> 03:14:42.219
to pull it apart.

03:14:42.228 --> 03:14:44.858
MARISHA: They look like they're still going for
it?

03:14:45.308 --> 03:14:46.707
MATT: It looks like it.

03:14:46.707 --> 03:14:52.150
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to run over and try and
collapse the sail. So it's not unfurled, try and

03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:54.404
collapse it? I don't know if that's the right
call.

03:14:54.404 --> 03:14:59.636
MATT: You can give it a shot. All right. You have
done a little bit of sail work. I'd say make a

03:14:59.636 --> 03:15:07.513
quick intelligence check. Having not been formally
trained, necessarily, we'll see if you can--

03:15:07.513 --> 03:15:10.235
MARISHA: 17.

03:15:10.235 --> 03:15:15.837
MATT: Yeah, in your time on the ship and studying
how the different elements of the ship maneuver

03:15:15.837 --> 03:15:25.638
together to create motion and riding the wind, you
figure out that one of the various ropes you pull

03:15:25.638 --> 03:15:31.686
and release and will cause the sail to entirely
come down, or you could just pull it up and cause

03:15:31.686 --> 03:15:35.759
it to no longer be unfurled.

03:15:35.759 --> 03:15:37.778
MARISHA: Whatever's quickest.

03:15:37.778 --> 03:15:42.959
MATT: Probably pull it in. You grab the rope and
pull it up. Both the harpies are curving around

03:15:42.959 --> 03:15:50.205
for another series of attacks on it, but you're
pulling that element of the sail up.

03:15:50.205 --> 03:15:53.756
MARISHA: Can I take a bonus action to do Patient
Defense after I do that?

03:15:53.756 --> 03:15:58.821
MATT: You can. Your arm holds the rope in place
and you get yourself ready in case anything

03:15:58.821 --> 03:16:01.810
happens. That finishes your go. Jester, you're
up.

03:16:01.810 --> 03:16:08.303
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon as
my bonus action right above the singing harpy and

03:16:08.303 --> 03:16:10.486
try to slam it down upon her head.

03:16:10.486 --> 03:16:11.997
MATT: Go for it.

03:16:11.997 --> 03:16:16.610
LAURA: What-- that-- I don't know.

03:16:16.610 --> 03:16:17.847
TALIESIN: That was exciting.

03:16:17.847 --> 03:16:25.432
LAURA: I feel like that shouldn't count, but
whatever. That is a 12.

03:16:25.432 --> 03:16:27.812
MATT: 12 hits.

03:16:27.812 --> 03:16:29.181
LAURA: Oh, good!

03:16:29.181 --> 03:16:33.671
MATT: They're not very hard to hit. They don't
have a lot of armor, if at all. They're more just

03:16:33.671 --> 03:16:39.036
a little dexterous, but other than that-- you see
these harpy forms. You see these humanoid female

03:16:39.036 --> 03:16:50.336
lithe bodies, naked, but their legs curl into
these taloned, hawk-like feet. They have these

03:16:50.336 --> 03:16:53.962
sets of wings that come off of it, and their long
stringy hair. Their faces are little--it goes

03:16:53.962 --> 03:17:00.870
beautiful to grotesque where the mouth itself seem
almost like the lips are shrunk and shriveled, and

03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:05.604
series of sharpened, broken teeth are visible from
where they open their mouth.

03:17:05.906 --> 03:17:07.478
LAURA: 12 damage.

03:17:07.478 --> 03:17:09.147
MATT: 12 damage.

03:17:09.147 --> 03:17:12.476
LAURA: Then, I'm going to use my action to--

03:17:12.976 --> 03:17:15.246
SAM: Action surge!

03:17:15.246 --> 03:17:19.677
LAURA: To cast Toll the Dead right over her head!
And ring a bell right across it.

03:17:19.677 --> 03:17:21.681
MATT: All right. What is--

03:17:21.681 --> 03:17:24.160
LAURA: Wisdom saving throw of 15.

03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:25.814
MATT: Natural one. No.

03:17:25.814 --> 03:17:28.155
LAURA: Yeah! That's 2d12.

03:17:28.155 --> 03:17:32.542
SAM: (like Sesame Street's The Count) A two, a D,
a 12. Ah, ah, ah!

03:17:32.874 --> 03:17:36.237
LAURA: Seven points of damage. Ah, ah, ah!

03:17:36.237 --> 03:17:44.293
MATT: You see the impact of the spiritual weapon,
the large spinning lollipop cracking into her

03:17:44.293 --> 03:17:50.394
face. The song stops for a second, and the blast
of divine energy in the middle of her head sets

03:17:50.394 --> 03:17:59.993
her off, but she pushes through and continues the
song. Looks pretty hurt and is wondering what to

03:17:59.993 --> 03:18:02.191
do next. That finishes your turn, Jester?

03:18:02.191 --> 03:18:06.403
LAURA: Yeah, I guess. I'm on the sail, right? I'm
on the top?

03:18:06.403 --> 03:18:09.827
MATT: Yeah, you're up at the top looking down, and
the two harpies that are spinning back, they

03:18:09.827 --> 03:18:12.808
definitely noticed you casting these spells.

03:18:12.808 --> 03:18:17.421
LAURA: Can I hold on? Can I grab onto rope or
anything? Or is that like an action?

03:18:17.421 --> 03:18:21.756
MATT: You can try to reach for something.

03:18:21.756 --> 03:18:26.547
LAURA: Could I consider my movement to like reach
down and hold onto like--

03:18:26.547 --> 03:18:29.690
MATT: I'll say you hold onto a rope, sure. That'll
be your movement. Okay, that finishes Jester's

03:18:29.690 --> 03:18:31.621
turn. Caduceus?

03:18:31.621 --> 03:18:35.494
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to cast-- I'm going to get myself into a

03:18:35.494 --> 03:18:44.662
reasonable position and I'm going to cast-- where
did it go? There it is. Calm Emotions. In theory,

03:18:44.662 --> 03:18:51.337
if this is a charm spell, and this counts as a
charm if I'm correct, you can just fail a charisma

03:18:51.337 --> 03:18:53.296
save, if you'd like.

03:18:53.296 --> 03:18:56.451
SAM: What? How does this-- Huh? Who?

03:18:56.451 --> 03:18:57.855
MATT: What are you attempting to do here?

03:18:57.855 --> 03:19:02.437
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Calm Emotions to negate
the charmed effect on Nott, and anybody within 20

03:19:02.437 --> 03:19:08.545
feet of me. Actually, anyone within 20 feet of
it. I'm going to run a few feet away from you,

03:19:08.770 --> 03:19:13.911
I'm going to take my staff and I'm going to pull
piece of silverware and bang that crystal. It's

03:19:13.911 --> 03:19:17.796
going to make a dissonant sound and
wakey-wakey.

03:19:17.796 --> 03:19:19.216
SAM: Whoa!

03:19:19.216 --> 03:19:21.551
MATT: I will say, because technically--

03:19:21.551 --> 03:19:27.246
TALIESIN: Charisma saving throw a creatures can
choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes.

03:19:27.246 --> 03:19:30.879
MATT: Well no, there is no saving throw if they're
suppressing it. So it just happens. Suddenly, the

03:19:30.879 --> 03:19:39.977
song that's entrancing you, you shake out of it as
Caduceus finishes muttering this phrase and you

03:19:39.977 --> 03:19:43.608
feel the clarity come to your mind once more.

03:19:43.608 --> 03:19:46.602
SAM: That was awesome.

03:19:46.602 --> 03:19:49.325
TALIESIN: We've got work to do.

03:19:49.325 --> 03:19:51.784
SAM: Okay.

03:19:51.784 --> 03:19:55.211
MATT: This also affects the other deckhands.

03:19:55.211 --> 03:20:01.039
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm just basically disrupting
that song as long as it's within a certain range

03:20:01.039 --> 03:20:09.329
for about a minute. I'm also going to use my bonus
action to wake up the bugs.

03:20:09.329 --> 03:20:17.364
MATT: The mass of winged beetles begin to clatter
out in a cloud.

03:20:17.364 --> 03:20:19.856
TALIESIN: The one that's singing, I'm going to
roll it towards the lollipop.

03:20:19.856 --> 03:20:22.041
MATT: Okay. They rush in there.

03:20:22.041 --> 03:20:23.438
TALIESIN: Snack time.

03:20:23.438 --> 03:20:26.020
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack. It's a d20.

03:20:26.020 --> 03:20:28.579
TALIESIN: 17.

03:20:28.579 --> 03:20:31.573
MATT: Yeah, that'll definitely hit. That is 2d--

03:20:31.573 --> 03:20:34.926
TALIESIN: I got to fix this at some point.

03:20:34.926 --> 03:20:39.911
MATT: Yeah, I'll make a print out. Remind me to make
a print out for you since this is having a hard time.

03:20:39.911 --> 03:20:42.753
TALIESIN: I know. We just haven't had time to fix
anything.

03:20:42.753 --> 03:20:44.160
MATT: I know.

03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:45.587
SAM: Why not?

03:20:45.587 --> 03:20:47.143
MATT: Yeah, it is 4d4.

03:20:47.143 --> 03:20:58.072
TALIESIN: That's right. That's ooh! 15 points of
damage.

03:20:58.072 --> 03:21:00.435
MATT: 15 points of damage?

03:21:00.435 --> 03:21:01.932
LAURA: Beetle damage!

03:21:01.932 --> 03:21:03.910
TALIESIN: I don't even know what just happened.

03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:05.592
MARISHA: Caduceus is back!

03:21:05.592 --> 03:21:10.679
MATT: Okay. The beetles are now swarming this
harpy who's taken bludgeoning. It is now bleeding

03:21:10.679 --> 03:21:15.625
profusely, and you can only see part of her torso
and she's like (screeching). The song is dropped,

03:21:15.625 --> 03:21:21.417
and now is trying to fly away as she's picking up
her wings, as these beetles are now tearing into

03:21:21.417 --> 03:21:24.590
her flesh. That ends your turn, Caduceus?

03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:26.431
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:21:26.431 --> 03:21:32.909
MATT: Yasha's turn. There's the two that are up on
top, darting down to pick up the guy. The one

03:21:32.909 --> 03:21:36.885
that's currently holding the other deckhand,
Yasha's going to rush forward, since it's

03:21:36.885 --> 03:21:40.306
technically within her melee range. She's going to
rush forward and take two strikes. If someone

03:21:40.306 --> 03:21:43.670
wants to roll for her.

03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:45.382
SAM: I will.

03:21:45.382 --> 03:21:46.725
MATT: Go for it.

03:21:46.725 --> 03:21:48.838
SAM: Nope, that's not a d20. A ten and a one.

03:21:48.838 --> 03:21:50.839
MATT: All righty. The ten hits, the one does not.

03:21:50.839 --> 03:21:52.786
SAM: Great.

03:21:52.786 --> 03:21:54.282
LIAM: I'm sure some stuff was added to the ten.

03:21:54.282 --> 03:21:56.611
MATT: All right. No, it's 3d6 actually.

03:21:56.611 --> 03:21:58.423
LAURA: I want to do that.

03:21:58.423 --> 03:21:59.712
MATT: Go for it.

03:21:59.712 --> 03:22:01.672
TALIESIN: Yeah! Teamwork!

03:22:01.672 --> 03:22:03.871
LAURA: Oh. Six!

03:22:03.871 --> 03:22:05.575
SAM: My rolls were better!

03:22:05.575 --> 03:22:07.409
LAURA: Your rolls would've been better.

03:22:07.409 --> 03:22:08.816
MATT: Great, okay.

03:22:08.816 --> 03:22:11.493
LAURA: You rolled a one on your hit. We both
suck.

03:22:11.493 --> 03:22:18.068
MATT: Yasha carves through a large chunk of it.
The harpy still holds onto the deckhand, but is

03:22:18.068 --> 03:22:25.144
unable to make a drop. This brings us to Nott and
Fjord.

03:22:25.144 --> 03:22:30.055
SAM: Is anyone in melee range with anyone else?

03:22:30.055 --> 03:22:35.186
MATT: Currently, there is the one holding the
deckhand that Yasha just attacked.

03:22:35.186 --> 03:22:36.617
SAM: I'm going to shoot at that one.

03:22:36.617 --> 03:22:38.400
MATT: Go for it.

03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:39.811
SAM: Okay. 15.

03:22:39.811 --> 03:22:42.094
MATT: That hits.

03:22:42.094 --> 03:22:44.930
SAM: Sneak attack.

03:22:44.930 --> 03:22:49.658
MATT: They're not very armored or dexterous
creatures.

03:22:50.158 --> 03:22:53.776
SAM: 18 points of damage!

03:22:53.776 --> 03:22:59.239
MATT: 18 points of damage, nice. Blasts! You see
it has to right itself, she's flapping her wings,

03:22:59.239 --> 03:23:04.586
but still holding on and trying now desperately to
just get away. There's no attempt to interface;

03:23:04.586 --> 03:23:06.914
she has her quarry and is about to bolt.

03:23:06.914 --> 03:23:08.725
SAM: Fire again, bonus action!

03:23:08.725 --> 03:23:10.021
MARISHA: Kill it.

03:23:10.021 --> 03:23:12.603
SAM: Oh, not good. 11.

03:23:12.603 --> 03:23:14.029
MATT: 11 just hits.

03:23:14.029 --> 03:23:16.326
LAURA: 11 hits!

03:23:16.326 --> 03:23:19.204
SAM: Hits! Whoa! No sneak attack. Eight points of
damage.

03:23:19.204 --> 03:23:27.276
MATT: Eight points of damage. Yeah, that'll do it.
As it's flying away, it gets about ten or so feet

03:23:27.276 --> 03:23:30.294
up, and the deckhand is screaming "Ah! Help me!"

03:23:30.294 --> 03:23:32.421
SAM: I've got you, nameless deckhand!

03:23:32.421 --> 03:23:38.835
MATT: The bolt hits it, spins in the air, a
cluster of feathers, then slams down hard on the

03:23:38.835 --> 03:23:44.537
deck of the ship. The deckhand also hits, and
rolls, and hits the side of the ladder that leads

03:23:44.537 --> 03:23:49.248
up to the poop deck. He's like (groaning) and now
starting to freak out looking at the other harpies

03:23:49.248 --> 03:23:51.624
that are circling. There's still five of them.

03:23:51.624 --> 03:23:55.597
SAM: I'll use my movement to run over to the
deckhand and be like: You're okay now!

03:23:55.597 --> 03:23:58.110
MATT: "Ah!"

03:23:58.110 --> 03:23:59.913
SAM: You're fine!

03:23:59.913 --> 03:24:02.037
MATT: All right. Fjord?

03:24:02.037 --> 03:24:07.310
TRAVIS: I'll aim two Eldritch Blasts up at one of
the two harpies that's flying up above the mast.

03:24:07.459 --> 03:24:09.076
MATT: Okay.

03:24:09.076 --> 03:24:11.318
TRAVIS: 19 on the first one.

03:24:11.318 --> 03:24:12.794
MATT: That hits.

03:24:12.794 --> 03:24:14.849
TRAVIS: And the second one is, ooh, 25.

03:24:14.849 --> 03:24:16.141
MATT: Both hit.

03:24:16.141 --> 03:24:20.563
TRAVIS: That is-- oh shit, where is the 1d10?
Ten!

03:24:20.563 --> 03:24:22.944
MATT: Ten points of damage on the first one--

03:24:22.944 --> 03:24:25.944
TRAVIS: Nope, no! Sorry, I was calling that out
like an idiot. 11 points of damage on the first

03:24:25.944 --> 03:24:29.481
one, and seven points of damage on the second
one.

03:24:29.481 --> 03:24:36.719
MATT: All right. You turn around, glancing up at
them, release that one blast of eldritch energy

03:24:36.719 --> 03:24:41.448
that crackles and spins, slamming into each of
them up in the air, and lights up the sky above

03:24:41.448 --> 03:24:46.980
the mast. You can see through the diffusing of the
impacts behind the sails on the opposite side of

03:24:46.980 --> 03:24:51.746
the deck, for those of you on the other end of the
ship. As both of them spin into a circle, taking

03:24:51.746 --> 03:24:57.728
pain from the impact, but then right themselves,
looking down to the source of this angry,

03:24:57.728 --> 03:25:00.222
aggressive act.

03:25:00.222 --> 03:25:01.896
TRAVIS: That's it.

03:25:01.896 --> 03:25:03.289
MATT: All right. That brings us to Caleb.

03:25:03.289 --> 03:25:08.951
LIAM: How far up the mast could you say I could
climb with my movement? Is that half speed?

03:25:08.951 --> 03:25:14.594
MATT: With your movement, it would be half speed
and I'd say, for you, who's not a necessarily an

03:25:14.594 --> 03:25:16.579
accomplished climber, it would be an athletics
check.

03:25:16.579 --> 03:25:17.893
LIAM: Okay.

03:25:17.893 --> 03:25:19.679
LAURA: Necessarily an "accomplished climber."

03:25:19.679 --> 03:25:20.988
TALIESIN: Indoor kid.

03:25:20.988 --> 03:25:22.551
LIAM: How high does the mast go?

03:25:22.551 --> 03:25:26.068
MATT: The mast would go up probably 25, 30 feet.

03:25:26.068 --> 03:25:30.875
LIAM: Nevermind. I will stand at the mast and I
will pull a white feather out of my coat and trace

03:25:30.875 --> 03:25:38.032
a baleful glyph in the air and cast Fear, and they
must make a wisdom saving at 16.

03:25:38.278 --> 03:25:39.622
MATT: Both of them?

03:25:39.622 --> 03:25:41.563
LIAM: Anything within 30 feet of Caleb.

03:25:41.563 --> 03:25:42.977
MATT: Anything within 30 feet of Caleb?

03:25:42.977 --> 03:25:44.250
SAM: Anything?

03:25:44.250 --> 03:25:45.675
LIAM: Enemies.

03:25:45.675 --> 03:25:46.622
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:25:46.622 --> 03:25:53.929
MATT: That would get three of them. The one that
failed to grab the other guy is just out of range.

03:25:53.929 --> 03:25:56.120
TRAVIS: There's only three left, right?

03:25:56.120 --> 03:25:58.409
MATT: There's five left, technically.

03:25:58.409 --> 03:25:59.947
TRAVIS: I thought there were only five?

03:25:59.947 --> 03:26:01.484
SAM: There were six--

03:26:01.484 --> 03:26:06.005
MATT: There were six total. One's died, one of
them's close to death, and there are two wounded,

03:26:06.005 --> 03:26:08.013
and two that have been untouched.

03:26:08.013 --> 03:26:09.650
TRAVIS: Oh, the song broke, it didn't die.

03:26:09.650 --> 03:26:11.658
LIAM: 16 wisdom save.

03:26:11.658 --> 03:26:18.637
MATT: That's a failure. That's a failure. And
that's a success! The one that had missed one of

03:26:18.637 --> 03:26:25.923
the deckhands and is on an up-swoop doesn't seem
affected. The two by the mast immediately, as the

03:26:25.923 --> 03:26:32.887
glyph completes, and there's this very subtle
burst of dark, dull-green shadow energy that

03:26:32.887 --> 03:26:38.655
emanates from you. Both of them (shrieking) and
are going to start getting the fuck out of Dodge.

03:26:38.655 --> 03:26:40.917
All right, that ends your turn, Caleb?

03:26:40.917 --> 03:26:42.554
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

03:26:42.554 --> 03:26:47.122
MATT: Back to the top of the round, harpies. Those
two harpies full dash, full run, go spinning back

03:26:47.122 --> 03:26:49.731
in the direction they came. As far away from you
as they can get.

03:26:49.731 --> 03:26:51.341
LIAM: <i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

03:26:51.341 --> 03:26:56.537
MATT: Those two, for the time being, are out of
the way. Let's see if they can make their save. Nope!

03:26:56.537 --> 03:27:00.890
LIAM: They have to be out of line of sight. If
they can see there's me on the boat--

03:27:00.890 --> 03:27:02.841
MATT: That's true, yeah.

03:27:02.841 --> 03:27:04.488
LIAM: That's what the spell says.

03:27:04.488 --> 03:27:07.974
MATT: Yeah, facing away doesn't matter. Yeah, no,
they're still running.

03:27:07.974 --> 03:27:09.469
LIAM: See ya!

03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:13.112
MATT: Okay. There's the one on the back that's
near death, it's going to attempt to fly away as

03:27:13.112 --> 03:27:17.224
well. It's going to move and dash. That's 80 feet
out, and it's trying to catch up with the other

03:27:17.224 --> 03:27:26.608
two. Now there's three of them fleeing. That one,
that one, and that one. All right. The two that

03:27:26.608 --> 03:27:33.689
are attacking-- there's two that are attacking the
mast. One picked him one, one that's singing. I

03:27:33.689 --> 03:27:46.678
know, I'm trying to remember where it is. Okay,
yeah. There we go. There's the one that tried to

03:27:46.678 --> 03:27:51.647
grab the one deckhand, it's going to swoop down
and try and grab him again because he hasn't made

03:27:51.647 --> 03:28:00.395
his way fully in. Does manage to grab him. Swoops
down, only gets partial, only 15 feet up with him.

03:28:00.395 --> 03:28:07.506
That's its turn. Let's see, the other two are
going to go ahead-- Two are fleeing. That's

03:28:07.506 --> 03:28:11.743
fleeing. Oh, there's only one that's free. That
one is going to attempt to attack one of the other

03:28:11.743 --> 03:28:17.194
sails because there's multiple sails up at that
point. A smaller one. You know what? No, it's

03:28:17.194 --> 03:28:20.786
going to come after you since you're the one
that's holding the sail. It's going to swoop down

03:28:20.786 --> 03:28:23.003
and attack you with claws.

03:28:23.003 --> 03:28:25.145
MARISHA: Come at me, bitch.

03:28:25.145 --> 03:28:30.270
MATT: That is a-- actually surprising, an 18.

03:28:30.270 --> 03:28:31.707
MARISHA: Miss.

03:28:31.707 --> 03:28:33.716
MATT: I think that misses you. Oh, it's at
disadvantage, too, because you have your--

03:28:33.716 --> 03:28:35.403
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

03:28:35.403 --> 03:28:38.138
MATT: Yes. Second attack. Yeah, misses with both.

03:28:38.138 --> 03:28:40.360
LIAM: You motherfucker.

03:28:40.360 --> 03:28:47.699
MATT: It's going to attempt to move 15 feet away
from you with the rest of its movement.

03:28:47.699 --> 03:28:49.166
MARISHA: Pop!

03:28:49.166 --> 03:28:51.003
MATT: Go for it. Make an attack.

03:28:51.003 --> 03:28:52.675
SAM: Punch attack!

03:28:52.675 --> 03:28:54.832
TRAVIS: Didn't we say we weren't going to try and
solve things with fists?

03:28:54.832 --> 03:28:56.623
SAM: Yeah, let's talk it out.

03:28:56.623 --> 03:28:58.722
MARISHA: It's all I have!

03:28:58.722 --> 03:29:00.586
TRAVIS: (cawing)

03:29:00.586 --> 03:29:01.676
MARISHA: 13. I believe that hits.

03:29:01.676 --> 03:29:03.685
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

03:29:03.685 --> 03:29:07.946
MARISHA: This is unarmed, ooh, ten total!

03:29:07.958 --> 03:29:09.896
MATT: All righty.

03:29:09.906 --> 03:29:12.301
LIAM: Max damage!

03:29:12.301 --> 03:29:18.809
MATT: And it cannot move. It's less of a punch, but
more of like with your open hand, you grab the back

03:29:18.809 --> 03:29:25.824
her leg and slam the harpy on the edge of the boat.
It gets dragged down and thrust down on the edge

03:29:25.824 --> 03:29:31.200
of the railing and crack a rib, and it's trying to get
out of your grasp and it manages to pull free,

03:29:31.200 --> 03:29:35.551
but now is right there next to you. Couldn't get
much further. You get the sense now that they're

03:29:35.551 --> 03:29:42.427
retreating. This was a quick harrying. They didn't
expect quite so much resistance, and most of

03:29:42.427 --> 03:29:48.966
them are wanting to get the hell out. With that
knowledge, Beau, it's your turn.

03:29:48.966 --> 03:29:53.895
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use the rope that I'm
holding onto, and I'm going to use that to lift

03:29:53.895 --> 03:29:58.382
myself up and do like a little swinging
double-kick action to this harpy.

03:29:58.382 --> 03:30:00.890
MATT: I love it. Go ahead and make your two
attacks.

03:30:00.890 --> 03:30:09.255
MARISHA: Little Cirque du Soleil shit. Both hit.
That's a 16 and a 19.

03:30:09.462 --> 03:30:11.378
MATT: That's correct. Go ahead and roll damage for
each.

03:30:11.378 --> 03:30:12.661
LIAM: Bop bop!

03:30:12.661 --> 03:30:17.006
MARISHA: Pop pop. For both of them.

03:30:17.006 --> 03:30:18.501
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:30:18.501 --> 03:30:20.347
LIAM: Yeah, high rolls!

03:30:20.347 --> 03:30:27.973
MARISHA: Eight plus five is 13 plus another six is
19.

03:30:27.973 --> 03:30:29.588
SAM: Oof.

03:30:29.588 --> 03:30:34.762
MATT: 19 points of damage. Both kicks (whack
whack) to the harpy as she's trying to get back up

03:30:34.762 --> 03:30:37.821
on the air; ends up knocking her back onto the
deck. (angry crowing)

03:30:37.821 --> 03:30:40.530
MARISHA: Still up?

03:30:40.530 --> 03:30:42.752
MATT: Still up and is now is going to continue to
try and make an escape.

03:30:42.752 --> 03:30:46.322
MARISHA: I'm going to take the rope and wrap it
around my fist once and <i>pop</i> with my bonus

03:30:46.322 --> 03:30:52.036
action. No, Flurry of Blows. Two attacks. Pop.
Pop.

03:30:52.036 --> 03:30:53.813
LIAM: Come on, Beauregard!

03:30:53.813 --> 03:31:00.084
MARISHA: Let me roll for two attacks. Okay, that
is 14 for one and a natural 19 for the other.

03:31:00.084 --> 03:31:01.832
MATT: Yeah, roll damage.

03:31:01.832 --> 03:31:05.993
MARISHA: Ten damage.

03:31:05.993 --> 03:31:08.035
MATT: Ten damage total?

03:31:08.035 --> 03:31:10.204
MARISHA: Yep.

03:31:10.204 --> 03:31:18.939
MATT: With the next hit, you go ahead and just
punch past the face and then with the other hand

03:31:18.939 --> 03:31:25.457
you wrap the rope around her throat then release.
You watch the tension of the sail as it unfurls

03:31:25.457 --> 03:31:31.134
and snaps the neck of the harpy and drags her up
and is now dangling from the rope as the sail is

03:31:31.134 --> 03:31:33.242
now unfurled again, still torn.

03:31:33.242 --> 03:31:35.203
TRAVIS: Did you do that on purpose?

03:31:35.203 --> 03:31:36.828
SAM: Wind physics.

03:31:36.828 --> 03:31:39.918
MARISHA: It was better results than I expected.

03:31:39.918 --> 03:31:41.857
LAURA: Always say yes!

03:31:41.857 --> 03:31:42.957
MARISHA: Yes.

03:31:42.957 --> 03:31:45.349
MATT: That finishes up Beau's turn. Jester, you're
up.

03:31:45.730 --> 03:31:51.181
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon
to send it to the harpy that is trying to get that

03:31:51.181 --> 03:31:53.149
guy off the ground.

03:31:53.149 --> 03:31:54.815
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:31:54.815 --> 03:32:01.558
LAURA: Nine plus seven, it hits.

03:32:01.558 --> 03:32:03.306
MATT: Yes, roll damage.

03:32:03.306 --> 03:32:07.365
LAURA: Eight points of damage to him.

03:32:07.365 --> 03:32:12.865
MATT: That was the first time that it's been
wounded. It gets hit by the large, spiritual

03:32:12.865 --> 03:32:16.515
lollipop as it's trying to carry off the deckhand,
still holding on.

03:32:16.515 --> 03:32:26.800
LAURA: I think I'm going to use Guiding Bolt on
the one that was flying away that was singing.

03:32:26.800 --> 03:32:31.616
MATT: Okay, go for it. It's quite a ways away and
you can see it (flapping).

03:32:31.616 --> 03:32:33.440
LAURA: I get 120 feet.

03:32:33.440 --> 03:32:36.010
MATT: Yeah, definitely within 120 feet, so go
ahead and roll for the attack on that.

03:32:36.010 --> 03:32:38.448
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:32:38.448 --> 03:32:40.059
MATT: Level one?

03:32:40.059 --> 03:32:41.202
LAURA: Yes, level one.

03:32:41.202 --> 03:32:43.036
MATT: It looks pretty hurt.

03:32:43.036 --> 03:32:44.776
LAURA: I don't know what I add to it.

03:32:44.776 --> 03:32:46.286
TALIESIN: It should be right above.

03:32:46.286 --> 03:32:47.495
LAURA: It's an 18, I get 18 plus whatever.

03:32:47.495 --> 03:32:50.144
MATT: Yeah, it's your spell attack bonus. The same
as your spiritual weapon.

03:32:50.144 --> 03:32:52.246
LAURA: Oh, okay plus seven. It's good.

03:32:52.246 --> 03:32:54.102
MATT: 4d6.

03:32:54.102 --> 03:32:57.747
LAURA: Oh, come on. Seven points of damage.

03:32:57.747 --> 03:33:02.879
MATT: Seven points of damage. As you bring the
spiritual weapon down, you turn to see the other

03:33:02.879 --> 03:33:07.889
one flying away. You release the bolt of vibrant,
radiant energy. It streaks off right as it's

03:33:07.889 --> 03:33:14.438
flying, heading it off. You quickly aim, watching
its arc and as it flies away (impact)

03:33:14.438 --> 03:33:20.398
(screeching). You watch this burst of light as its
body tumbles and <i>sploosh</i> into the ocean water

03:33:20.398 --> 03:33:24.061
below. Jester, that finishes your turn. Caduceus,
you're up.

03:33:24.061 --> 03:33:32.720
TALIESIN: Sure. Yeah. There's one that's trying to
get away with one of our deckhands?

03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:34.885
MATT: Correct, it's been hit once.

03:33:34.885 --> 03:33:44.989
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm just going to nuts and bolts
this. I don't suppose my insect swarm can attack

03:33:44.989 --> 03:33:46.999
for a bonus action?

03:33:46.999 --> 03:33:49.114
MATT: It can't get close enough, unfortunately.

03:33:49.114 --> 03:33:50.985
TALIESIN: Well, then.

03:33:50.985 --> 03:33:53.619
MATT: Yeah, the other harpy pulled away from it.
It can move closer, but it's not going to--

03:33:53.619 --> 03:33:56.262
TALIESIN: I guess I'll do a Guiding Bolt at level
three.

03:33:56.262 --> 03:33:57.652
MATT: Okay.

03:33:57.652 --> 03:34:01.658
TALIESIN: I just saw you that. I'm like: Ah.

03:34:01.658 --> 03:34:03.211
MATT: All right.

03:34:03.211 --> 03:34:10.587
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 19, so that's 6d6.

03:34:10.587 --> 03:34:12.179
LAURA: Damn.

03:34:12.179 --> 03:34:13.550
TRAVIS: Shit.

03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:16.463
MATT: Caduceus, looking at the swarm, turns
around, holds the staff in the air towards the one

03:34:16.463 --> 03:34:19.154
taking off with one of your deckhands and when you
saw the bright beam--

03:34:19.154 --> 03:34:24.445
TALIESIN: 16 points of damage.

03:34:24.445 --> 03:34:34.023
MATT: Ooh! Spins around and releases a far heavier
and brighter burst of light that streaks into and

03:34:34.023 --> 03:34:41.966
blasts into the harpy, wobbles in the air for a
second. The energy explodes and is now spinning,

03:34:41.966 --> 03:34:48.817
keeping this weird shifting, like an atom spin
around the outside of its body. The next attack

03:34:48.817 --> 03:34:52.822
has advantage because of Guiding Bolt. It's
looking pretty hurt, too.

03:34:52.822 --> 03:34:54.318
LAURA: Show off.

03:34:54.318 --> 03:34:56.497
MATT: That finishes Caduceus's round.

03:34:56.497 --> 03:34:59.652
SAM: Is it carrying our deckhand over open water
now?

03:34:59.652 --> 03:35:01.356
LAURA: Not yet.

03:35:01.356 --> 03:35:03.083
MATT: No, not yet.

03:35:03.083 --> 03:35:04.516
SAM: Okay.

03:35:04.516 --> 03:35:13.721
MATT: Yasha's turn. Yasha-- it just grabbed him
and is trying to pull away. Yasha's-- I don't

03:35:13.721 --> 03:35:15.870
think Yasha's close enough to hit and melee it, it
pulled him up too high.

03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:18.789
TRAVIS: "Throw the sword," no.

03:35:18.789 --> 03:35:21.910
MATT: Yeah, she's not going to do that.

03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:23.176
TRAVIS: Fuck!

03:35:23.203 --> 03:35:28.570
MATT: Yeah, that's not happening. There's not much
Yasha can do right now.

03:35:28.605 --> 03:35:30.060
LAURA: Can she jump and swing?

03:35:30.060 --> 03:35:36.078
MATT: Not really. Sorry. Yasha's going to get
underneath though, and prepare in case it does get

03:35:36.078 --> 03:35:39.785
knocked down a peg or whatever, just gets the
sword at the ready and is eyeballing it angrily,

03:35:39.785 --> 03:35:45.418
and is going to rage because that's fun. All right,
that brings us to Nott and Fjord.

03:35:45.456 --> 03:35:49.077
SAM: I will fire at the thing. With my crossbows.

03:35:49.077 --> 03:35:53.736
MATT: You do have disadvantage though, because
it's out of your firing range, although you can

03:35:53.743 --> 03:35:56.869
probably move up closer and get within range. It's
up to you, you can do that.

03:35:56.869 --> 03:35:58.708
MARISHA: The deckhand one?

03:35:58.708 --> 03:36:00.902
SAM: Yeah, there's only one left, right? No?
Maybe?

03:36:00.903 --> 03:36:02.412
TALIESIN: I think so, yeah.

03:36:02.412 --> 03:36:03.679
LAURA: Yeah, there's one left.

03:36:03.719 --> 03:36:05.505
SAM: I only rolled an 11.

03:36:05.505 --> 03:36:08.637
TALIESIN: But you also have advantage because it's
got Guiding Bolt.

03:36:08.811 --> 03:36:09.826
MATT: Yes.

03:36:09.826 --> 03:36:11.063
SAM: Oh, that helps.

03:36:11.063 --> 03:36:12.852
MATT: 11 does hit, but--

03:36:12.852 --> 03:36:14.887
SAM: Oh, well that's even better, 17 to hit.

03:36:14.887 --> 03:36:16.113
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

03:36:16.113 --> 03:36:18.715
SAM: Sneak attack, because it's-- no, it's holding
the friend.

03:36:18.715 --> 03:36:20.988
MATT: Not technically -- it's holding, yeah, and
it's not even an ally who's in combat with it, so.

03:36:20.988 --> 03:36:24.477
SAM: It's an employee. Seven points of damage.

03:36:24.477 --> 03:36:27.454
MATT: Seven points of damage, all right. (arrow
sound) Still flying.

03:36:27.454 --> 03:36:29.917
SAM: I'll shoot again, one more time.

03:36:29.917 --> 03:36:31.478
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

03:36:31.478 --> 03:36:33.142
SAM: 18 to hit.

03:36:33.142 --> 03:36:34.399
MATT: Yeah.

03:36:34.399 --> 03:36:36.405
SAM: Only eight more points of damage.

03:36:36.405 --> 03:36:38.568
MARISHA: That's pretty good.

03:36:38.568 --> 03:36:40.116
MATT: That'll do it.

03:36:40.116 --> 03:36:41.827
(cheering)

03:36:41.827 --> 03:36:45.267
MATT: And all out of hit points. So (arrow sound)
the second one, you watch as it goes (pained

03:36:45.267 --> 03:36:49.350
sounds) and it begins to just careen down towards
the edge of the ship.

03:36:49.350 --> 03:36:50.175
SAM: Oh no!

03:36:50.175 --> 03:36:53.301
MATT: It's about to slam-- we'll see, there's a
percentage chance here.

03:36:53.301 --> 03:36:55.336
SAM: Ooh, percentage dice?

03:36:55.336 --> 03:36:59.847
MATT: I'm going to roll a percentile dice to see
if it hits either on the deck, or over the edge.

03:36:59.847 --> 03:37:02.286
No, it hits on the deck.

03:37:02.286 --> 03:37:04.118
SAM: Oh, nice.

03:37:04.118 --> 03:37:09.223
MATT: 50% chance of either. It crashes in to the
other guy, slams in to the side of the railing,

03:37:09.223 --> 03:37:13.366
manages to pull free and catches up with the other
guy as they both run inside the ship. At this

03:37:13.366 --> 03:37:15.472
point, the other harpies now are just--

03:37:15.472 --> 03:37:16.592
TRAVIS: Bugging out.

03:37:16.794 --> 03:37:18.199
MATT: Bugging out and fleeing.

03:37:18.199 --> 03:37:20.933
MARISHA: Threats are all gone more or less?

03:37:20.933 --> 03:37:27.997
MATT: At the moment-- by the time your spell would
wear off, there are none to be seen.

03:37:27.997 --> 03:37:35.555
LAURA: Can I hang from my rope that I was holding
on to and slowly start casting Mending on the sail?

03:37:35.555 --> 03:37:37.379
MATT: Sure.

03:37:37.379 --> 03:37:39.098
TRAVIS: Oh, smart.

03:37:39.098 --> 03:37:46.492
LIAM: Caleb clutches his chest and cries out and
falls to the floor of the boat. (gasping)

03:37:46.492 --> 03:37:49.192
SAM: Oh no, it's his condition!

03:37:49.192 --> 03:37:51.156
LAURA: (shouting) What's wrong with Caleb?!

03:37:51.156 --> 03:37:52.680
SAM: It's a heart condition!

03:37:52.680 --> 03:37:53.919
TRAVIS: Since when?!

03:37:53.919 --> 03:37:56.468
SAM: He always has had one since he was a boy.

03:37:56.468 --> 03:37:58.549
TRAVIS: Do you have any medicine for him?

03:37:58.549 --> 03:38:00.550
SAM: Yes! He needs mouth to mouth resuscitation.

03:38:00.769 --> 03:38:01.989
TRAVIS: Well, get at it!

03:38:01.989 --> 03:38:07.226
SAM: No, no, no. My mouth is too small for a human
jaw to make perfect contact.

03:38:07.226 --> 03:38:09.186
TRAVIS: Just cup his nose, just (breathes).

03:38:09.186 --> 03:38:11.837
SAM: No, I can't get my mouth wide enough, too
many teeth are in the way!

03:38:11.837 --> 03:38:14.130
LAURA: I'll do it!

03:38:14.130 --> 03:38:16.383
SAM: That would be good, you or Beau really.

03:38:16.383 --> 03:38:23.119
LAURA: I drop down. I have, like, really good
medicine training.

03:38:23.119 --> 03:38:24.647
SAM: All right.

03:38:24.647 --> 03:38:27.635
LAURA: (exhaling heavily)

03:38:27.635 --> 03:38:32.179
MATT: Okay. Well Caleb, just for the sake of it,
roll a deception check.

03:38:32.369 --> 03:38:33.455
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, sure.

03:38:33.455 --> 03:38:34.845
TRAVIS: "<i>Ja</i>, sure."

03:38:34.845 --> 03:38:36.938
MATT: Just out of curiosity.

03:38:36.938 --> 03:38:39.294
LIAM: It's pretty good. 20.

03:38:39.294 --> 03:38:43.704
TRAVIS: Caleb, always pretending he's hurt.

03:38:43.704 --> 03:38:48.606
MATT: Caleb is having a rough -- a terrible --
yeah, all right, so just-- so are you --

03:38:48.606 --> 03:38:53.223
LAURA: I'm going to try to blow into his mouth
as hard as I can.

03:38:53.223 --> 03:38:54.708
TRAVIS: You know how much that hurts?

03:38:54.708 --> 03:38:56.507
MATT: Yeah, it's super uncomfortable, Caleb.

03:38:56.507 --> 03:39:03.946
SAM: I think it'll help-- he's still not out of
the woods, I think we all need to pray.

03:39:03.946 --> 03:39:06.072
LIAM: (strained) That's not what I was expecting!

03:39:06.072 --> 03:39:08.416
LAURA: Oh good, you're alive!

03:39:08.416 --> 03:39:10.474
TRAVIS: Do you want to lead the prayer?

03:39:10.474 --> 03:39:11.859
SAM: Yes.

03:39:11.859 --> 03:39:15.411
LIAM: Oh, thank goodness! You know I'm such a
fearful person.

03:39:15.411 --> 03:39:17.368
SAM: Oh, maybe he's okay.

03:39:17.368 --> 03:39:20.838
LIAM: I'm always getting scared of things and that
one was too much for me.

03:39:20.838 --> 03:39:22.766
TRAVIS: He could be on the edge of life and, maybe
the prayer.

03:39:22.766 --> 03:39:24.105
LAURA: I start climbing back up.

03:39:24.105 --> 03:39:26.685
MARISHA: Glad you're not dead again, buddy.

03:39:26.685 --> 03:39:28.295
LIAM: I look over at Nott.

03:39:28.295 --> 03:39:33.014
SAM: Wow! You guys, we saved his life with the
power of friendship!

03:39:33.014 --> 03:39:37.164
TRAVIS: Was that-- I thought it was Jester's
healing.

03:39:37.164 --> 03:39:40.701
SAM: Yeah, but we all were there to pitch in.

03:39:40.701 --> 03:39:42.967
TRAVIS: I just watched.

03:39:42.967 --> 03:39:50.865
LIAM: Caleb is beet red. Beet red. Face matches
his hair.

03:39:50.865 --> 03:39:52.798
TALIESIN: I don't understand anything that just--

03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:55.878
TRAVIS: How do we prevent further heart episodes
from--

03:39:55.878 --> 03:39:58.309
SAM: More friendship! Just more friendship.

03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:59.852
TRAVIS: <i>More</i> friendship?

03:39:59.852 --> 03:40:03.510
LIAM: No, we just need to not be attacked by
anything anymore, we need to just stop pursuing

03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:06.574
our pursuits, and pick an island and stay there.

03:40:06.574 --> 03:40:10.082
MARISHA: Are you saying you want to retire from
adventuring life, Caleb?

03:40:10.082 --> 03:40:11.988
TRAVIS: Beau, go give Caleb a hug.

03:40:11.988 --> 03:40:16.980
LIAM: I feel pretty good, I feel like--

03:40:16.980 --> 03:40:20.403
MARISHA: You're so-- why are you so stiff?

03:40:20.403 --> 03:40:24.452
TRAVIS: Like a Voldemort hug.

03:40:24.452 --> 03:40:27.344
LIAM: This is feeling like it's going too far,
Nott.

03:40:27.344 --> 03:40:30.379
SAM: (hisses) It's working!

03:40:30.379 --> 03:40:40.636
MARISHA: We've only done this once before, Caleb.
It's still weird, I just want to point that out.

03:40:40.636 --> 03:40:43.445
Okay, let go of me. Get off, yeah.

03:40:43.445 --> 03:40:48.514
LIAM: Is it hot? Feels hot.

03:40:48.514 --> 03:40:50.802
LAURA: (whispers) 12.

03:40:50.802 --> 03:40:52.798
MATT: No sign of any harpies.

03:40:52.798 --> 03:40:54.294
TRAVIS: How's that sail coming, Jester?

03:40:54.294 --> 03:40:55.765
LAURA: I'm working on it!

03:40:55.765 --> 03:40:58.967
MATT: It takes a short time but you manage to, in
the next ten minutes or so, feel comfortable that

03:40:58.967 --> 03:41:01.901
you've mended most of what the harpies had done.

03:41:01.901 --> 03:41:05.924
TALIESIN: I'm going to go down and let the crew
know that everything seems to be copacetic upstairs.

03:41:05.924 --> 03:41:10.970
MATT: The two crew that you hired who already
rushed in there are in the process of telling

03:41:10.970 --> 03:41:15.888
the story of what they just saw. They're like,
"And then there was a blasting light up there!

03:41:15.888 --> 03:41:17.605
"It was crazy!"

03:41:17.605 --> 03:41:26.859
TALIESIN: Hey, everything seems to have calmed
down upstairs, everything seems fine. I think I'm

03:41:26.859 --> 03:41:32.507
going to try blintzes for breakfast tomorrow. I
feel like we could all use a treat.

03:41:32.507 --> 03:41:36.560
MATT: You notice half of them go, "Yeah!"

03:41:36.810 --> 03:41:39.877
TALIESIN: They don't know what I'm making them out
of, but yeah.

03:41:39.877 --> 03:41:43.630
MATT: No. And the other half are like, "Blintzes?"

03:41:43.630 --> 03:41:48.560
TRAVIS: Are we putting limits on your cuisine,
Taliesin?

03:41:48.560 --> 03:41:54.932
TALIESIN: Not anymore! I now have the song "Every
Little Piece" from Pete's Dragon going through my head.

03:41:54.932 --> 03:42:02.376
SAM: There's a harpy dead on deck, right?

03:42:02.376 --> 03:42:05.512
MATT: Two of them.

03:42:05.512 --> 03:42:10.358
SAM: I'm going to definitely butcher one of them
and try to take some meat for myself, and for the crew.

03:42:10.358 --> 03:42:12.379
MATT: Go ahead and make a general medicine check.

03:42:12.379 --> 03:42:13.991
SAM: Oh my goodness.

03:42:13.991 --> 03:42:16.670
MATT: I'll say with disadvantage because you're
not too familiar with the body of a harpy.

03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:17.880
SAM: Eight.

03:42:17.880 --> 03:42:27.783
MATT: You butcher it. That's a gamey-ass harpy.
You do get some meat. To you it looks delicious,

03:42:27.783 --> 03:42:32.059
but everyone else, you're like, "I'm good." You
get like a pound.

03:42:32.059 --> 03:42:33.995
SAM: I want some wing.

03:42:33.995 --> 03:42:35.523
MATT: Okay.

03:42:35.523 --> 03:42:37.474
SAM: Maybe they can deep fry it.

03:42:37.474 --> 03:42:39.063
MATT: It's pretty sinewy.

03:42:39.063 --> 03:42:40.676
TALIESIN: Do we have an empty barrel?

03:42:40.676 --> 03:42:42.663
LAURA: I bought a couple barrels.

03:42:42.663 --> 03:42:44.471
MATT: You guys bought a number of barrels. You
filled a lot of them--

03:42:44.471 --> 03:42:49.590
TALIESIN: Whatever is left over if you could put
in there, and I'm going to start something and

03:42:49.590 --> 03:42:50.940
hopefully something--

03:42:50.940 --> 03:42:52.722
SAM: Like a stock?

03:42:52.722 --> 03:42:54.548
MARISHA: He wants his dead people tea.

03:42:54.548 --> 03:42:58.094
TALIESIN: I don't know what I'm going to get, I've
never tried harpy before. It could be mushrooms,

03:42:58.094 --> 03:42:59.730
could be anything.

03:42:59.730 --> 03:43:01.357
TRAVIS: Start something.

03:43:01.357 --> 03:43:03.226
LIAM: Some bone broth, maybe?

03:43:03.226 --> 03:43:05.956
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a little zing and
see what I get.

03:43:05.956 --> 03:43:14.529
MARISHA: Seeing Nott butcher the harpy, I go: Ooh!
I look in my pocket and I pull out owl Frumpkin.

03:43:14.529 --> 03:43:16.356
Is owl Frumpkin okay?

03:43:16.356 --> 03:43:18.220
MATT: Owl Frumpkin is fine.

03:43:18.220 --> 03:43:20.174
MARISHA: Hey! Sorry about that.

03:43:20.174 --> 03:43:22.024
MATT: (owl hoot)

03:43:22.024 --> 03:43:25.826
MARISHA: Back in my pocket.

03:43:25.826 --> 03:43:29.404
TRAVIS: Start moving his feet and his eyes stay in
the same place.

03:43:29.404 --> 03:43:31.827
MARISHA: I make his head dance a little bit.

03:43:31.827 --> 03:43:35.778
LIAM: I rolled for him last week and he
appropriately only has one hit point.

03:43:35.778 --> 03:43:45.929
MATT: Good to keep that in mind. As you bring your
things in for the evening, that comes to a close;

03:43:45.929 --> 03:43:51.594
your second full day of travel, now the following
morning, comes to bear. Who's keeping watch for

03:43:51.594 --> 03:43:53.371
this day?

03:43:53.371 --> 03:43:55.522
TALIESIN: Sure, I'll take that.

03:43:55.522 --> 03:43:57.715
MATT: Make a perception check for me please.

03:43:57.715 --> 03:44:00.478
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's terrible. 13.

03:44:00.478 --> 03:44:11.778
MATT: 13, okay. For the day, you don't see
anything. You do-- no, you don't see anything.

03:44:11.778 --> 03:44:14.458
Okay. Ocean! All wide ocean.

03:44:14.458 --> 03:44:20.211
TRAVIS: Are you listening underneath the boat?
Using your sonar?

03:44:20.211 --> 03:44:23.365
MATT: Yeah, what are you doing with your barrel?

03:44:23.365 --> 03:44:29.567
TALIESIN: I just was going to put anything that
was dead now, and I was just going to see if I

03:44:29.567 --> 03:44:33.620
could maybe start either-- I don't know what
they're going to make, but I'm curious if it's

03:44:33.620 --> 03:44:36.339
going to be anything I can either eat or use as a
spice.

03:44:36.339 --> 03:44:38.748
MATT: Okay, so you just begin to Decompose.

03:44:38.748 --> 03:44:42.360
TALIESIN: I'm using the Decompose and ferment and
maybe hopefully getting some mushrooms or

03:44:42.360 --> 03:44:45.084
something, I don't know what harpies make. We'll
find out.

03:44:45.084 --> 03:44:51.642
MATT: You'll find out. It'll be a little while.
You watch as the start of various fungus and fuzzy

03:44:51.642 --> 03:45:01.246
mold begins to appear at edges of its corpse.
You've started it; a couple days, maybe you'll

03:45:01.246 --> 03:45:04.009
have something that will give you an idea what is
growing.

03:45:04.009 --> 03:45:06.346
TALIESIN: Yeah, if it's good I keep it, if it's
bad I toss it.

03:45:06.346 --> 03:45:09.524
MATT: Next evening? All right, go ahead and make a
perception check.

03:45:09.524 --> 03:45:14.390
TRAVIS: I don't know why I keep volunteering for
fucking perception. 14.

03:45:14.390 --> 03:45:21.862
MATT: 14. Okay. Make your survival check for me as
the captain, please. With advantage, because you

03:45:21.862 --> 03:45:23.717
have Orly on board.

03:45:23.717 --> 03:45:26.631
TRAVIS: 12.

03:45:26.631 --> 03:45:33.300
MATT: That's successful, you're not picking up any
additional speed like you were the day before...

03:45:33.300 --> 03:45:46.848
okay, uneventful. At one point you pass by a few
small rock islands, bits of stone that are

03:45:46.848 --> 03:45:54.555
breaking through the surface, too far away to make
any details. They're not large; one set appears to

03:45:54.555 --> 03:46:00.110
be maybe ten, 12 feet across, the other one looks
to be about 40 or so feet across. Just little

03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:04.692
breaks in the water, where a little mass of stone
has breached, but that's all you can make out. The

03:46:04.692 --> 03:46:14.215
evening goes by, uneventful. By the third day, the
morning comes around, Orly comes up to the top,

03:46:14.215 --> 03:46:28.641
comes to you and goes, "Excuse me, Captain. I'm
keeping tabs on our travels southward, I can see

03:46:28.641 --> 03:46:32.652
"the reef is approaching."

03:46:32.652 --> 03:46:43.287
TRAVIS: Excellent. (laughter) Well, let's prepare
to navigate through it!

03:46:43.287 --> 03:46:47.476
TALIESIN: Such captaining.

03:46:47.476 --> 03:46:54.660
TRAVIS: I just picked it as a backstory, I didn't know
I'd need to know fucking anything about sailing! Jesus.

03:46:54.660 --> 03:46:56.805
SAM: Someone get Travis a subscription to Sailing
Monthly or something.

03:46:56.805 --> 03:47:00.773
MATT: There are different-- see those Y marks?
Each one of those is going to be a survival check

03:47:00.773 --> 03:47:04.274
to try and maneuver the boat through the reef.

03:47:04.602 --> 03:47:07.174
LAURA: Do we get advantages on those or something?

03:47:07.174 --> 03:47:11.267
MATT: Yes, because you have Orly with you, and
Orly is working with you side by side, holding up

03:47:11.267 --> 03:47:16.457
the map and looking at the scenery. A lot of the
crew's on the deck as well keeping eyes out.

03:47:16.457 --> 03:47:18.734
LIAM and SAM: The dodecahedron!

03:47:18.734 --> 03:47:20.928
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah! Focus on this, Fjord!

03:47:20.928 --> 03:47:22.512
LIAM: Take a huff.

03:47:22.512 --> 03:47:25.336
MATT: You have your Fragment of Possibility.

03:47:25.336 --> 03:47:30.119
TRAVIS: These are survival checks?

03:47:30.119 --> 03:47:33.762
MATT: Yes, with advantage. For the first one--

03:47:33.762 --> 03:47:35.456
TRAVIS: 16.

03:47:35.456 --> 03:47:41.145
MATT: You guys can now see-- at first it just
looks like open water, but then as you begin to

03:47:41.145 --> 03:47:47.638
maneuver past the first section, looking down 20
feet, 15 feet, ten feet, some of them barely

03:47:47.638 --> 03:47:55.612
breaching the surface, you can see these colorful
reefs that are full of vibrant life, all sorts of

03:47:55.612 --> 03:48:01.300
manner of sea creatures and fish going through,
and within a very short distance you can see

03:48:01.300 --> 03:48:10.119
broken wood. You can see other ships, the remnants
of which have been scattered across the reef, and

03:48:10.119 --> 03:48:19.622
have since been overgrown. Carefully making your
way through this gap, you manage to curve slightly

03:48:19.622 --> 03:48:27.631
one bit, the back of your stern scrapes at one
point on one edge, but any damage would be

03:48:27.631 --> 03:48:34.698
superficial, and you manage to maneuver past where
you can see one set of sticks that have been tied

03:48:34.698 --> 03:48:41.404
together and embedded into the reef just below,
just barely peeking past-- breaking the surface.

03:48:41.404 --> 03:48:46.416
And that's the first sign you see of one of those
points.

03:48:46.416 --> 03:48:50.686
LIAM: (pirate voice) Dead men tell no tales.

03:48:50.686 --> 03:48:54.690
MATT: Now that you've seen it, that's going to be
your guiding point for each portion of this reef.

03:48:54.690 --> 03:49:02.644
You and Orly both, going through and traversing
this, you can see the next path before you. Both

03:49:02.644 --> 03:49:04.920
of you together, go ahead and make another
survival check with advantage.

03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:09.156
TRAVIS: Got to use the dodeca.

03:49:09.156 --> 03:49:14.843
MATT: All right, roll one more. You only roll one
more, so pick one and roll it.

03:49:14.843 --> 03:49:17.249
TRAVIS: That's a ten.

03:49:17.249 --> 03:49:18.951
MATT: Total is a ten?

03:49:18.951 --> 03:49:21.015
TRAVIS: Survival is minus two for me.

03:49:21.015 --> 03:49:24.702
SAM: Minus two? You're our fucking captain!

03:49:24.702 --> 03:49:26.377
TRAVIS: Not very wise!

03:49:26.377 --> 03:49:39.190
MATT: All right then. As you make your way through
the next portion of the reef, turning it over, you

03:49:39.190 --> 03:49:49.441
hear it impact a heavy portion of the reef, scraping
across it. The ship's hull does take damage.

03:49:49.441 --> 03:49:52.042
LAURA: Gallan, go! Go fix it!

03:49:52.042 --> 03:50:01.431
MATT: Okay, that is 11 points of hull damage.
Eventually pulls past and dislodges from the

03:50:01.431 --> 03:50:06.559
MATT: reef. Looking behind, you can see parts of it
that are broken and falling in and pieces of wood

03:50:06.799 --> 03:50:12.553
that have been dragged off and splintered. The crew
rushes down inside and making an investigation

03:50:12.738 --> 03:50:19.214
check-- pretty high-- they do not see any damage
to the hull that's taking on water, but that was

03:50:19.214 --> 03:50:25.278
not a happy thing. You do not know how many more
of those type of hits you'll take before the ship

03:50:25.278 --> 03:50:29.744
begins to take on water and they can't do repairs
to the hull unless it's in a port of some kind.

03:50:29.744 --> 03:50:32.343
TRAVIS: There's not a hit point counter on the
wheel? That's ticky tock?

03:50:32.343 --> 03:50:36.290
LAURA: I'm going to stay down where it was and
cast Mending as much as possible.

03:50:36.290 --> 03:50:40.265
MATT: You have no visual perspective on it. All
the damage is below the surface of the water.

03:50:40.265 --> 03:50:43.342
LAURA: Oh, yeah. At all. I'm just going to keep my
hands on the--

03:50:43.342 --> 03:50:44.969
MATT: Just in case. Okay.

03:50:44.969 --> 03:50:45.870
LAURA: Yeah.

03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:48.504
MATT: Keeping low. All right, so that's the
second one. You're marking each of these

03:50:48.504 --> 03:50:49.894
that you pass by?

03:50:49.894 --> 03:50:51.488
TRAVIS: Yeah. One and two. We're on the third.

03:50:51.488 --> 03:50:52.689
MATT: We're on the third.

03:50:52.689 --> 03:50:53.585
MARISHA: Come on.

03:50:53.585 --> 03:50:55.071
MATT: Go ahead and try again now.

03:50:55.071 --> 03:50:56.587
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:50:56.778 --> 03:51:02.407
MATT: Okay! The channel you've made your way
through in the reef is getting narrower and you

03:51:02.407 --> 03:51:10.426
can see elements of the reef are beginning to
vanish into just jutting pieces of stone. It looks

03:51:10.426 --> 03:51:15.869
like, in a weird way from a distance, like a
series of gravestones. Familiar to you as you pass

03:51:15.869 --> 03:51:21.997
by as bits of rock are breaking the surface, some
at odd angles and there were semblances of stone

03:51:21.997 --> 03:51:28.331
spires that naturally jut from underneath the
water that the reef is built on over time. The

03:51:28.331 --> 03:51:34.328
channel gets thinner here, but thankfully after
that last hit, you dig deep in yourself and be

03:51:34.328 --> 03:51:39.886
like, "No, I've seen ships go through this, I'm
getting the feel for this whole captain thing,"

03:51:39.886 --> 03:51:45.053
and between you and Orly communicating, you manage
to just make it through the channel. At a point,

03:51:45.053 --> 03:51:50.840
all of you hold your breath as you see elements of
the reef that should be wide enough to put maybe a

03:51:50.840 --> 03:51:56.998
ship that's slightly larger than the one you have
in, but with even just a small narrow margin of

03:51:56.998 --> 03:52:01.916
failure here, you would've ground against the side
of one or the other side. You cut straight through

03:52:01.916 --> 03:52:06.487
perfectly, balancing on both sides, coming past
the third marker beneath the surface, this one

03:52:06.487 --> 03:52:12.673
breaking through about a foot past the water. As
you spin around, you guys begin to just barely see

03:52:12.673 --> 03:52:21.932
the shadowed landmass of an island beginning to
appear as your destination. As you come to the

03:52:21.932 --> 03:52:27.011
final portion of the reef's channel, go ahead and
make your final check.

03:52:27.011 --> 03:52:28.998
LAURA: Come on, Tusktooth!

03:52:28.998 --> 03:52:30.495
TRAVIS: 13.

03:52:30.495 --> 03:52:40.536
MATT: 13. You come through the last portion of
this. It's a very tight location and you and Orly

03:52:40.536 --> 03:52:44.671
look back and forth. You may have been a little
off in the portion of the reef you thought you

03:52:44.671 --> 03:52:48.839
were supposed to take through this broken channel
and as you do-- it seems fine, and you're looking

03:52:48.839 --> 03:52:53.477
at the front of the ship, a bunch of them gathered
at the bow, and look over, both on port and

03:52:53.477 --> 03:52:57.336
starboard side and go, "I think we'll be all
right!" (crashing)

03:52:57.336 --> 03:52:58.826
SAM: Oh no!

03:52:58.826 --> 03:53:04.986
MATT: Grinds over a portion of the reef, the ship
jolts. It wasn't a hard hit. You're just grinding

03:53:04.986 --> 03:53:09.851
over the top of it and you're breaking a lot of
the reef right there in the process of doing so.

03:53:09.851 --> 03:53:15.255
You don't take as much damage as the last hit, but
you do take some damage. That's a bad roll. You

03:53:15.255 --> 03:53:21.568
take nine more hull damage. With that, Jester,
(whooshing) water begins to pour in from the side.

03:53:21.568 --> 03:53:28.104
This is less of just mending a small object; this is
structural hull damage.

03:53:28.299 --> 03:53:30.803
LAURA: Gallan! Gallan, come on, carpenter!

03:53:30.803 --> 03:53:33.431
SAM: Gallan, wake up!

03:53:33.431 --> 03:53:38.489
MATT: A single break or tear in an object you
touch. Mending is not going to help you with this.

03:53:38.489 --> 03:53:40.033
LAURA: No.

03:53:40.033 --> 03:53:44.083
MATT: Gallan and anybody who wants to come help,
the hull is now taking on water.

03:53:44.083 --> 03:53:46.114
LAURA: Yeah, I want to help block it.

03:53:46.114 --> 03:53:48.213
MATT: Okay. What are you doing to help block it?

03:53:48.213 --> 03:53:49.929
LAURA: I'm going to--

03:53:49.929 --> 03:53:57.897
MATT: It's essentially a one, one-and-a-half foot
long break and the wood is torn away, it's broken

03:53:57.897 --> 03:54:00.912
apart, and there's a gap where the water's now
pouring in.

03:54:00.912 --> 03:54:06.445
LAURA: Is there any furniture I can rip apart and
we can nail to it real fast?

03:54:06.445 --> 03:54:10.569
MATT: Make a perception check real fast as you
glance around the chamber.

03:54:10.569 --> 03:54:17.420
LAURA: That dropped out of my hand, it shouldn't
count. Aw, it was so much better when it didn't. Nine.

03:54:17.420 --> 03:54:19.776
SAM: Oh, rough.

03:54:19.776 --> 03:54:28.618
MATT: Looking around, there's some of the barrels
and in the various quarters of the interior of the

03:54:28.618 --> 03:54:32.488
ship there's some cots and there's some sacks and
whatever supplies people brought with them.

03:54:32.488 --> 03:54:35.827
Nothing comes to mind, looking around. You're kind
of panicking. All the rest of the crew are

03:54:35.827 --> 03:54:40.032
suddenly coming down they're starting to get a
bucket chain, trying to just get water out of

03:54:40.032 --> 03:54:45.404
there as they have no idea at the moment. Gallan
gets his tools, starts looking around for whatever

03:54:45.404 --> 03:54:51.950
scrap materials they had purchased. You're now an
inch of water in the bottom of the ship. Anyone

03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:53.894
else doing anything to help here?

03:54:53.894 --> 03:54:58.581
SAM: Some barrels. Come on, captain, tell us what
to do!

03:54:58.581 --> 03:55:00.651
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

03:55:00.651 --> 03:55:03.311
SAM: You're the fucking captain!

03:55:03.311 --> 03:55:04.738
TRAVIS: Abandon ship!

03:55:04.738 --> 03:55:06.217
SAM: No!

03:55:06.217 --> 03:55:11.645
LAURA: Can I use one of the barrels and start
scooping the water into the barrel and lift the

03:55:11.645 --> 03:55:13.655
barrel up and out and try to carry it?

03:55:13.655 --> 03:55:16.044
MARISHA: Me and Yasha help with the barrel-train.

03:55:16.044 --> 03:55:19.437
MATT: You guys are slowing the water coming on
board.

03:55:19.437 --> 03:55:22.326
SAM: Oh, Caleb! You're a wizard, freeze the
water!

03:55:22.326 --> 03:55:25.205
LIAM: I am not able to do that.

03:55:25.205 --> 03:55:26.589
SAM: Ah!

03:55:26.589 --> 03:55:29.919
LAURA: Can we take the barrel that I was holding
the water in and stick it over the hole and then

03:55:29.919 --> 03:55:32.053
hold it?

03:55:32.053 --> 03:55:34.065
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:55:34.065 --> 03:55:35.781
MARISHA: I miss my druid.

03:55:35.781 --> 03:55:42.148
MATT: Yeah. Yasha goes and grabs the other side of
the barrel and both of you go try and force and

03:55:42.148 --> 03:55:43.487
hold it there.

03:55:43.701 --> 03:55:48.805
LIAM: I start working on Leomund's Tiny Hut. It's
going to take some time.

03:55:48.805 --> 03:55:51.545
MATT: All right. How much time?

03:55:51.545 --> 03:55:54.427
LIAM: Ten minutes. 11 minutes, yeah.

03:55:54.427 --> 03:55:57.423
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make a strength
check, with Yasha's help, with advantage.

03:55:57.423 --> 03:56:04.728
LAURA: Okay. Goddamn it, really? 12.

03:56:04.728 --> 03:56:13.236
MATT: 12. You hold the barrel over and it seals.
(bursting water) You're holding it there but it's

03:56:13.236 --> 03:56:19.450
spraying around the edges. The barrel immediately
fills, and you're now trying to cork the hole with

03:56:19.450 --> 03:56:22.637
this barrel and it's just (spraying sounds) all
around you--

03:56:22.637 --> 03:56:28.102
SAM: Fjord, go swim down on the outside and plug
it from the outside. Go!

03:56:28.102 --> 03:56:29.481
MARISHA: With what?!

03:56:29.481 --> 03:56:31.013
SAM: Bring something!

03:56:31.013 --> 03:56:32.659
MARISHA: What?

03:56:32.659 --> 03:56:34.087
SAM: Some pieces of wood!

03:56:34.087 --> 03:56:36.032
TALIESIN: Do we have a mattress or something like
that? Do we have anything?

03:56:36.032 --> 03:56:42.433
MATT: They're less mattresses in the ship. There
are cots. There is actually a mattress in the

03:56:42.433 --> 03:56:45.128
captain's quarters. There's the one mattress.

03:56:45.128 --> 03:56:52.569
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll drag that out and jump over the
side and try and push up against the hole.

03:56:52.569 --> 03:56:54.420
MARISHA: It's fabric!

03:56:54.420 --> 03:56:55.810
MATT: Is that what you're doing?

03:56:55.810 --> 03:56:57.099
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:56:57.099 --> 03:57:02.456
TALIESIN: I'm going to join you and tie ourselves
off and I'm going to also cast Water Walk if

03:57:02.456 --> 03:57:04.382
you're into it on--

03:57:04.382 --> 03:57:07.294
TRAVIS: I'm thrilled. We can still go underwater
though, right?

03:57:07.294 --> 03:57:09.059
MATT: Yeah, and you can walk on the surface if you
choose to.

03:57:09.059 --> 03:57:15.459
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you Water Walk for the
moment because you're probably stronger than I am.

03:57:15.459 --> 03:57:17.246
I should probably not do this.

03:57:17.246 --> 03:57:19.292
MARISHA: I'll go up there and hold that safety
line that you were talking about.

03:57:19.292 --> 03:57:21.017
TALIESIN: You've got Water Walk.

03:57:21.017 --> 03:57:28.132
TRAVIS: I throw the mattress in, I jump in after
it, and I try and go under--

03:57:28.132 --> 03:57:33.202
MATT: You can stand on the surface and then,
below--

03:57:33.202 --> 03:57:35.769
TALIESIN: There's a suction.

03:57:35.769 --> 03:57:39.499
MATT: You get below and you get the mattress--
what do you do?

03:57:39.499 --> 03:57:43.799
TRAVIS: I press it against the outside of the ship
and hope the current (suctioning).

03:57:43.799 --> 03:57:47.644
MATT: Okay, make a perception check because it's
under the water and you're not entirely certain

03:57:47.644 --> 03:57:52.616
where-- there's a large scrape section where a lot
of the reef pulled against the hull.

03:57:52.616 --> 03:57:54.532
TRAVIS: 20.

03:57:54.532 --> 03:57:57.917
MATT: 20, yeah. Glancing down, as you're about to
go help, you look and you can see, of all the

03:57:57.917 --> 03:58:00.745
damage that's taken that's superficial, there's
one section where it looks like a heavy groove is

03:58:00.745 --> 03:58:07.134
carved out from that last impact, and there you
can see this faint shift of the water pouring

03:58:07.134 --> 03:58:15.965
through that gap. You take and hold down the
mattress and it pulls against it. It's there in

03:58:15.965 --> 03:58:20.717
place-- the suction's holding it. You're not sure
how long it'll hold there without anything holding

03:58:20.717 --> 03:58:22.513
it in place.

03:58:22.513 --> 03:58:25.821
TALIESIN: I'm going to run down below and-- all
right, fix it! Fix it, now! Got to get it up! I

03:58:25.821 --> 03:58:28.396
start trying to pull the barrels apart--

03:58:28.396 --> 03:58:31.521
MATT: Gallan, at this point, has his tools and
starts handing out nails left and right. He

03:58:31.521 --> 03:58:34.596
brought an additional set of tools so two of you
can--

03:58:34.596 --> 03:58:36.578
TALIESIN: I'm also going to cast Light in there to
make it super, super light.

03:58:36.578 --> 03:58:38.965
MATT: While you're brightening that, Gallan's over
there. He's hammering in the nails--

03:58:38.965 --> 03:58:40.790
LAURA: I'll help.

03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:43.545
MATT: Two barrels down, pulled apart to get
materials to try and patch this.

03:58:43.545 --> 03:58:45.691
MARISHA: I'm still part of the water bucket
brigade.

03:58:45.691 --> 03:58:52.409
LIAM: Correction for me, not 11 minutes, 20
minutes. Still doing it.

03:58:52.409 --> 03:58:56.818
SAM: I'm on the top of the-- crow's nest? Is that
what it's called?

03:58:56.818 --> 03:58:58.935
MATT: Crow's nest is the very top.

03:58:58.935 --> 03:59:00.876
SAM: As far away from the water as possible.

03:59:00.876 --> 03:59:02.798
MATT: Okay. "Looking good!"

03:59:02.798 --> 03:59:04.504
SAM: Yeah.

03:59:04.504 --> 03:59:09.887
MATT: All right, great. You're there. Because the
ship is still moving, you're having to hold it in

03:59:09.887 --> 03:59:16.618
place while walking on the side. It seems to be
holding itself okay for the time being, just from

03:59:16.618 --> 03:59:22.515
the pressure of the water, but it's starting to
slide off as it goes. It's a weird scenario where

03:59:22.515 --> 03:59:26.867
now that it's blocking the section, there's no
suction, there's just the pressure of the water,

03:59:26.867 --> 03:59:30.318
but as it moves it is sliding along with it.

03:59:30.318 --> 03:59:33.793
TRAVIS: I'll take the sword, shove it-- no, I'm
just kidding.

03:59:33.793 --> 03:59:43.554
MATT: All right. Jester, you're helping out with
the repairs? Make a general d20 check.

03:59:43.554 --> 03:59:49.252
LAURA: Two.

03:59:49.252 --> 03:59:51.149
MATT and MARISHA: Aw.

03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:58.531
MATT: I lost that d20, I'll pick that up later.
Oh! Natural 20 on Gallan's turn. If you needed

03:59:58.531 --> 04:00:01.061
that any time, it's fucking now!

04:00:01.061 --> 04:00:02.745
LAURA: Ooh, Gallan!

04:00:02.745 --> 04:00:14.108
MATT: Gallan sees you mucking up. (grunting) "Let
me do it, hold on. Here's how you place it over--

04:00:14.108 --> 04:00:19.170
"fuck it. Shit." He does it himself. He goes to
town, and earns his keep since he arrived here.

04:00:19.170 --> 04:00:25.184
One by one, begins taking the best parts of the
barrel that Yasha helped him break, begins holding

04:00:25.184 --> 04:00:30.477
it in place. "Hold this here!" He starts nailing
it down. Eventually, over the 20 or so minutes it

04:00:30.477 --> 04:00:34.689
takes for him to cast the spell, he patches it in
a way where he's like, (Scottish accent) "This will

04:00:34.689 --> 04:00:42.376
"hold for a little bit. But we're going to
have--" Why'd I go Scottish there for a second?

04:00:42.376 --> 04:00:51.383
"This will hold for a little bit. I don't know how
long. We're going to have to figure out some way

04:00:51.383 --> 04:00:52.750
"to fix this, get it to shore, or something."

04:00:52.750 --> 04:00:54.055
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:00:54.055 --> 04:00:55.874
LAURA: Yes, of course.

04:00:55.874 --> 04:00:57.124
MATT: (sighs) "Okay."

04:00:57.124 --> 04:00:58.874
TRAVIS: I say from outside the boat: Yeah.

04:00:58.874 --> 04:01:07.429
MATT: As you're walking alongside the boat, it's
going to pick up speed a little bit here. You're

04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:10.842
going to have to either have to let this mattress
go or find a way to keep it in place. What are you

04:01:10.842 --> 04:01:12.188
going to do?

04:01:12.188 --> 04:01:13.376
TRAVIS: I'll let it go.

04:01:13.376 --> 04:01:19.915
MATT: Okay. The mattress slides away and you see
water (spraying). It's a slow leak. It is still

04:01:19.915 --> 04:01:22.008
taking on water, but slowly.

04:01:22.056 --> 04:01:23.935
LAURA: Okay.

04:01:23.935 --> 04:01:29.598
MATT: It's a patch job. When Caleb returns, he can
tell us what the fuck he was planning with the spell.

04:01:29.598 --> 04:01:32.516
TRAVIS: I'll tug on the line and get myself pulled
back up into that boat.

04:01:32.516 --> 04:01:34.955
SAM: We're taking on water?!

04:01:34.955 --> 04:01:36.244
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:01:36.244 --> 04:01:39.383
SAM: Oh god. We have to-- anything non-essential
just throw overboard!

04:01:39.383 --> 04:01:40.998
LAURA: No, no, no.

04:01:40.998 --> 04:01:42.839
TRAVIS: We got to get the crow's nest out of the
boat.

04:01:42.839 --> 04:01:45.845
SAM: No, everything overboard. Everything! The
sails, everything.

04:01:45.845 --> 04:01:52.268
MATT: The crew now rapidly getting the water out
of the bottom of the cargo hold. They're throwing

04:01:52.268 --> 04:01:57.602
it overboard. You gather with the slow leak, in
the next couple hours they'll be able to minimize

04:01:57.602 --> 04:01:59.883
the amount of water that's below there.

04:01:59.883 --> 04:02:01.076
LAURA: Okay.

04:02:01.111 --> 04:02:04.778
MARISHA: Does it look like there's a little island
nearby?

04:02:04.778 --> 04:02:09.509
TRAVIS: Yes, we've done the final turn, so we
could try and push towards the island, but we're

04:02:09.509 --> 04:02:12.091
going to have to beach it.

04:02:12.091 --> 04:02:18.266
MATT: You guys are now turning towards the island
and it's an open bay now. You passed the reef, and

04:02:18.266 --> 04:02:24.391
you're heading towards the island of Urukayxl.

04:02:24.391 --> 04:02:28.495
TALIESIN: Is there anywhere that looks like a dock,
or anywhere that looks like it's appropriate to--?

04:02:28.495 --> 04:02:30.624
MATT: Make a perception check.

04:02:30.624 --> 04:02:35.768
TALIESIN: Yeah, I am. I think that's right, 26.

04:02:35.768 --> 04:02:41.137
MATT: 26. No dock, but you do see another ship.

04:02:41.137 --> 04:02:42.961
SAM: Ah!

04:02:42.961 --> 04:02:44.500
TRAVIS: What's your spell do?

04:02:44.500 --> 04:02:45.908
LAURA: What was your spell doing?

04:02:45.908 --> 04:02:49.565
LIAM: I'm making the tiny hut, but I don't know
how much time has passed while I was peeing.

04:02:49.565 --> 04:02:55.095
MATT: 20 minutes as they've try to makeshift plug
the hole. It's a slow leak still, but they've

04:02:55.095 --> 04:02:56.581
managed to hold it off.

04:02:56.581 --> 04:03:00.639
LIAM: A ten-foot radius, immobile dome of force
springs into existence around and above you and

04:03:00.639 --> 04:03:05.548
remains stationary for the duration. Environment
or weather can't get in, so that's up to you if

04:03:05.548 --> 04:03:07.293
the ocean can get in or not.

04:03:07.293 --> 04:03:12.924
MATT: I would say-- you know what, that's clever.
I will say if you choose not to let the ocean in,

04:03:12.924 --> 04:03:14.340
it will not.

04:03:14.340 --> 04:03:15.727
LAURA: Yay!

04:03:15.727 --> 04:03:22.083
LIAM: It is totally transparent. All of us can
look through it and see into the ocean.

04:03:22.106 --> 04:03:23.597
SAM and LIAM: Glass bottom boat!

04:03:23.597 --> 04:03:25.475
MATT: There you go.

04:03:25.475 --> 04:03:27.701
LAURA: How long will it stay?

04:03:27.701 --> 04:03:29.737
LIAM: Eight hours.

04:03:29.737 --> 04:03:32.161
LAURA: Nice. Long enough for us to patch it up.

04:03:32.161 --> 04:03:38.822
LIAM: I can certainly, 20 minutes in advance, get
it going again. As long as I can focus, indefinitely.

04:03:38.822 --> 04:03:42.110
TRAVIS: We've approached the island. We have
another boat.

04:03:42.110 --> 04:03:43.959
TALIESIN: How do you want to play this?

04:03:43.959 --> 04:03:45.362
TRAVIS: What?

04:03:45.362 --> 04:03:50.481
TALIESIN: That's another boat. Are we making
ourselves known or are we not making

04:03:50.481 --> 04:03:52.310
ourselves known?

04:03:52.310 --> 04:03:55.468
LAURA: Off to the side. Park it away from the
other boat.

04:03:55.468 --> 04:03:57.356
TRAVIS: But I think it's daytime, right?

04:03:57.356 --> 04:03:58.587
MATT: It is, yeah.

04:03:58.587 --> 04:04:00.344
TRAVIS: If we can see them, they can see us.

04:04:00.344 --> 04:04:04.071
TALIESIN: How far away is the other boat?

04:04:04.071 --> 04:04:06.572
MATT: I'd say it's--

04:04:06.572 --> 04:04:08.290
TALIESIN: Is it possible they haven't seen us
yet?

04:04:08.290 --> 04:04:16.186
MATT: They're about maybe-- as you're breaking
past the reef, they're a few miles away.

04:04:16.186 --> 04:04:20.989
TALIESIN: Would it be reasonable to think they've
seen us by this point?

04:04:20.989 --> 04:04:26.327
MATT: It's possible. If you can see them with your
naked eye, there's a chance they've seen you, but

04:04:26.327 --> 04:04:28.411
you don't know. You have no way to confirm that.

04:04:28.411 --> 04:04:30.432
MARISHA: Does it look like they're coming or going
from that island?

04:04:30.432 --> 04:04:36.235
MATT: You just noticed them, you don't see any
motion yet. You'd probably have to try and

04:04:36.235 --> 04:04:38.249
gauge it over a period of time.

04:04:38.249 --> 04:04:41.881
TRAVIS: I will try to increase our speed towards
the island in the direction away from them and

04:04:41.881 --> 04:04:44.754
aim to get on the island, if we can.

04:04:44.754 --> 04:04:46.921
TALIESIN: All right.

04:04:46.921 --> 04:04:50.280
MATT: You are covering that. You've given that
information to Orly and he's like, "All right.

04:04:50.280 --> 04:04:58.669
"I'll keep to that way there." He begins to lead you
in that direction, you move the ship that way.

04:04:58.669 --> 04:05:04.705
Keeping watch as you're shifting around. Are you
going south or north side? You're heading south

04:05:04.705 --> 04:05:08.962
towards the island as you went through
the reefs, so now you're on the northwestern

04:05:08.962 --> 04:05:11.275
side of the island.

04:05:11.537 --> 04:05:15.790
TRAVIS: It just depends on where the ship was, if
it was directly ahead of us or towards the north

04:05:15.790 --> 04:05:18.366
or the south, we'd obviously go the opposite way.

04:05:18.366 --> 04:05:21.038
MATT: Okay, it's a little bit north of where
you're headed.

04:05:21.038 --> 04:05:23.065
TRAVIS: We're going to the southern tip.

04:05:23.065 --> 04:05:27.244
MATT: You're cruising, and you're keeping an eye
closely you watch as the ship was stationary

04:05:27.244 --> 04:05:29.977
begins to move in the direction you're traveling.

04:05:29.977 --> 04:05:31.620
SAM: Oh no.

04:05:31.620 --> 04:05:36.561
TRAVIS: We're going to ground this ship. We're
going straight into the beach and we're going to

04:05:36.561 --> 04:05:38.668
run our asses into the fucking jungle.

04:05:38.668 --> 04:05:40.552
SAM: How will we get back?

04:05:40.552 --> 04:05:42.663
TRAVIS: I don't know. We're not there yet.

04:05:42.663 --> 04:05:44.602
SAM: You are a terrible captain.

04:05:44.602 --> 04:05:46.243
TRAVIS: I throw Nott overboard. Full sail!

04:05:46.243 --> 04:05:50.846
MATT: All right.

04:05:50.846 --> 04:05:52.921
TRAVIS: I grab her and bring her back. No, I'm
just kidding.

04:05:52.921 --> 04:05:55.477
MARISHA: You know that video of the monkeys
throwing the raccoon?

04:05:55.477 --> 04:05:56.555
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

04:05:56.555 --> 04:05:59.111
MARISHA: That's what I imagined.

04:05:59.111 --> 04:06:04.949
MATT: In pushing the ship ahead as fast as you can
with the hole plugged, towards the south side of the

04:06:04.949 --> 04:06:11.651
island in the attempt to beach it, as you continue
the ship is moving to head you off at the pass.

04:06:11.651 --> 04:06:12.488
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

04:06:12.488 --> 04:06:16.167
MATT: Eventually you start getting a closer look
at it, and it's a bigger ship than the one you

04:06:16.167 --> 04:06:18.846
have now. It's dual mast.

04:06:18.846 --> 04:06:23.020
TRAVIS: Yep. Does it have some trap doors on the
side of the--?

04:06:23.020 --> 04:06:26.396
MATT: Well, make a perception check.

04:06:26.396 --> 04:06:30.921
TRAVIS. Yeah. 16.

04:06:30.921 --> 04:06:40.519
MATT: You look and you don't see any, and then you
do because one of them opens. You watch as one of

04:06:40.519 --> 04:06:42.538
the gun ports (popping).

04:06:42.538 --> 04:06:45.685
TALIESIN: I'm going to raise the flag?

04:06:45.685 --> 04:06:47.783
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not.

04:06:47.783 --> 04:06:49.313
SAM: What flag do we have?

04:06:49.313 --> 04:06:50.564
LIAM: The white flag.

04:06:50.564 --> 04:06:51.844
TALIESIN: The blue flag.

04:06:51.844 --> 04:06:53.168
TRAVIS: We've got the gray wave one.

04:06:53.168 --> 04:07:00.446
MATT: Okay, as you get situated, you hear (cannon
explosion) (water splashing), but a ways away.

04:07:00.785 --> 04:07:02.643
SAM: It's a warning shot!

04:07:02.643 --> 04:07:04.646
MATT: Yeah. It is a warning shot.

04:07:04.646 --> 04:07:06.463
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

04:07:06.463 --> 04:07:08.339
SAM: Raise the flag!

04:07:08.339 --> 04:07:11.337
TALIESIN: I rose it, it's been risen. It is
risen.

04:07:11.337 --> 04:07:22.576
TRAVIS: I use Mask of Many Faces to make myself
look like Captain Jawgrasp. You, lower the flag

04:07:22.576 --> 04:07:30.947
and-- hmm. Fuck, I don't know. Jesus Christ.

04:07:30.947 --> 04:07:33.756
TALIESIN: It's tough being the smart one, eh?

04:07:33.756 --> 04:07:36.425
LIAM: Yeah, no more Grog.

04:07:36.425 --> 04:07:38.358
TALIESIN: Be bold.

04:07:38.358 --> 04:07:42.823
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it, we're going to beach the ship.
We're just going to keep driving towards the island.

04:07:42.823 --> 04:07:44.907
MATT: You're going to keep going?!

04:07:44.907 --> 04:07:45.874
TRAVIS: Yep.

04:07:45.874 --> 04:07:46.912
LIAM: (excitedly) Yeah!

04:07:46.912 --> 04:07:49.164
TRAVIS: How far are we? That's another question.

04:07:49.164 --> 04:07:53.842
MATT: Oh you're probably, at this point, about a
mile and a half, two miles.

04:07:53.842 --> 04:07:56.939
TRAVIS: Oh no no, nevermind. No. We'll slow down
the ship a little.

04:07:56.939 --> 04:08:04.027
MATT: Yeah, it's quite a distance from the island,
you notice it as you go to move. It's quite a ways.

04:08:04.027 --> 04:08:07.266
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah. We'll lower the flags, slow
the ship.

04:08:07.266 --> 04:08:12.063
MATT: Okay. You slow the ship-- do you come to a
stop?

04:08:12.063 --> 04:08:13.841
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

04:08:13.841 --> 04:08:17.925
MATT: All right. The ship, you bring it slowly
down. Do you drop anchor?

04:08:17.925 --> 04:08:23.070
SAM: Caleb? I want to talk about mutiny.

04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:34.858
MATT: As you're watching off to the side, you can
see all the gun ports are open now. But you see

04:08:34.858 --> 04:08:42.646
two smaller boats that are now coming towards you
from the other ship. You can see two separate

04:08:42.646 --> 04:08:45.160
small crews that are rowing in your direction.

04:08:45.160 --> 04:08:51.885
TRAVIS: Cool. Let's lower the rope ladder over the
side and welcome them aboard.

04:08:51.885 --> 04:08:57.126
TALIESIN: You could technically stand and offer, I
might add. Since you can actually stand on water.

04:08:57.126 --> 04:08:59.012
TRAVIS: I can what?

04:08:59.012 --> 04:09:00.011
TALIESIN: You can stand on water right now..

04:09:00.011 --> 04:09:01.351
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know if he did that, so let's
not.

04:09:01.351 --> 04:09:05.476
MATT: The other ship has maneuvered up to the
point where it is now, its full starboard side is

04:09:05.476 --> 04:09:11.650
facing you, full gun ports open. You're in a bad
position.

04:09:11.917 --> 04:09:13.691
TRAVIS: Yep!

04:09:13.691 --> 04:09:16.644
MARISHA: Is there anything in the sails? Any
flags, iconography?

04:09:16.644 --> 04:09:18.575
MATT: Make a perception check.

04:09:18.575 --> 04:09:22.830
MARISHA: My perception checks have been garbage.
Six.

04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:29.656
MATT: There is one sail that is currently
partially unfurled. But from this distance it

04:09:29.656 --> 04:09:32.197
looks like it's facing away from you, from the
direction you're looking, so you can't make out

04:09:32.197 --> 04:09:33.937
any details on it. But there is some sort of
stitching in it.

04:09:33.937 --> 04:09:37.501
TALIESIN: We do have his flag up, though.

04:09:37.501 --> 04:09:44.909
MATT: Yeah, you do have the ship's flag up above
the Mistake. As these row boats steadily make

04:09:44.909 --> 04:09:51.426
there way towards your ship, the moment of
possible parley approaching, we're going to end

04:09:51.426 --> 04:09:56.408
the episode there. We'll pick up there for our
live show in New York next week.

04:09:56.408 --> 04:09:58.656
SAM: Boats!

04:09:58.656 --> 04:10:00.658
LIAM: Boats in New York.

04:10:00.658 --> 04:10:04.041
MARISHA: Weren't we on boats for our first Gen Con
liveshow?

04:10:04.041 --> 04:10:08.926
MATT: No, you guys were in the Feywild. You fought
a feymire crocodile there.

04:10:08.926 --> 04:10:11.630
LIAM: Just lost the southern tip.

04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:12.725
TALIESIN: Just the tip.

04:10:12.725 --> 04:10:18.299
SAM: Oh boy, does that mean we all need to wear
sailing clothing to our show in New York?

04:10:18.299 --> 04:10:20.160
MATT: (laughs) You should, Sam.

04:10:20.160 --> 04:10:22.275
TALIESIN: Oh man.

04:10:22.275 --> 04:10:24.608
MARISHA: That's actually a good thing. We were
trying to figure out what to wear!

04:10:24.608 --> 04:10:26.590
TALIESIN: We've been having that discussion about
what to wear.

04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:29.098
MARISHA: We do the cast of South Pacific.
Yeah!

04:10:29.098 --> 04:10:33.880
SAM: Yes! Ooh! Could we all get sailor's costumes
with the bell bottoms?

04:10:33.880 --> 04:10:36.392
MARISHA: Can the ladies be pirates?

04:10:36.392 --> 04:10:38.073
LAURA: Yeah!

04:10:38.073 --> 04:10:40.317
TALIESIN: It can't be hard--

04:10:40.317 --> 04:10:42.110
SAM: Fleet week!

04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:44.363
MATT: Careful, guys, you're making promises the
internet live right now.

04:10:44.363 --> 04:10:46.761
LAURA: We'll figure something out.

04:10:46.761 --> 04:10:48.280
SAM: Call a rental house.

04:10:48.280 --> 04:10:54.324
TALIESIN: I was going to say we could also get
some blue bell bottoms and some Japanese school

04:10:54.324 --> 04:10:56.152
tops and fake it.

04:10:56.152 --> 04:10:59.697
MARISHA: I mean, I know you can two-day ship any
type of--

04:10:59.697 --> 04:11:01.431
LAURA: Costume on Amazon.

04:11:01.431 --> 04:11:07.843
MARISHA: Yeah. Especially ones that look like for
sex role play. You can get tons of those.

04:11:07.843 --> 04:11:09.872
TALIESIN: I don't know what video very
specifically--

04:11:09.872 --> 04:11:12.831
LIAM: You heard it here. Next week in New York,
live on stage.

04:11:12.831 --> 04:11:15.664
SAM: Live sex. Live sailor sex!

04:11:15.664 --> 04:11:18.380
TALIESIN: It's the pilot--

04:11:18.380 --> 04:11:21.892
MARISHA: I was going to say, it was the high school
pilot outfit.

04:11:21.892 --> 04:11:23.467
TALIESIN: I know exactly what you're talking
about.

04:11:23.467 --> 04:11:26.655
LIAM: Your shipping dreams and your shipping
dreams are coming true.

04:11:26.655 --> 04:11:30.326
MATT: On that note, guys.

04:11:30.326 --> 04:11:32.347
SAM: Thank you, Backblaze!

04:11:32.347 --> 04:11:36.825
MATT: Thank you, Backblaze. Thank you, D&D Beyond.
Thank you guys for coming along with us for a

04:11:36.825 --> 04:11:39.810
crazy nautical adventure this week.

04:11:39.810 --> 04:11:40.951
LAURA: Yay!

04:11:40.951 --> 04:11:45.896
MATT: We love you, and in tougher times, we love
you a lot. Have a wonderful week. We'll see you

04:11:45.896 --> 04:11:50.372
next Thursday, and is it Thursday yet? Good
night.

04:11:50.372 --> 04:24:23.561
[music]
