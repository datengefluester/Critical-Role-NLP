NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.360
[MATT MERCER VO] For as long as I can recall,
I've quested for a hero of a different kind.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.120
I have traveled far and wide, weaving tales with friends so that I can bring joy

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.690
to any ear willing to listen.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.961
Through conclaves and cows, goldfish and gnolls,

00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:19.700
only one quest has alluded me.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.070
Till now.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.840
Everything has prepared me for this moment.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.550
This serpentine path from the humble beginnings at 
our mimosa-stained dinnertable,

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.430
now brings me to donning a crappy Halloween store cloak

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.660
and venturing to the threshold at the Ed Sullivan Theatre.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.700
Here, the hero I have searched for now awaits.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.960
Ready for his own journey.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.530
Our hero: Stephen Colbert. 
Our enemy: child poverty.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.450
Our adventure: the search for the 
crimson sphere of generosity.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.839
Are we rolling?
Are we rolling now?

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.209
[COLBERT] This is magic right here.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.209
Oh, yeah.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.090
The magic for me--
like the fun for me is reentering into this

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.010
after all my teen years completely obsessed with it.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.700
And then I--I havent, I haven't rolled the dice

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.043
since I was a senior in college, maybe?

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:25.230
-- Wow.
-- Yeah, or maybe the first year out of college.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.000
-- Gotcha.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.020
-- 'Cause I lived with a couple of people who play.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.020
-- Right, right.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.260
-- We played a couple of times. But I'd lost the--

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.100
I'd lost a step.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.920
-- That's okay! 
-- You know, because--

00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:37.945
All right, I'll stop.
-- No worries.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.040
-- Is this okay?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.640
Is this guy okay here? Is he blocking too much?

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.240
-- I think it's pretty solid.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.500
-- I used to use this for pitches sometimes.

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:49.775
When the writers would come with a pitch,
I'd go--

00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:52.152
[tinny growling noise]

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.750
I go, I love it.
But the cave troll--

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.680
I love the idea. He's got a problem with it,
and it's kind of a partnership.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.240
-- It's good to have plausible deniability.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240
-- Yeah, exactly.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.520
-- So, yeah, quick overview.
Bard, they're essentially a charismatic spell caster.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.800
-- Right. Is it one of those things where you 
actually have to go through another

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.979
whole character class first?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.931
The way like monk is?

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.480
Like monk, you had to go through like cleric
and then be a monk, or--

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.839
-- There used to be rules, yeah, where you had to
multiclass through.

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.969
-- Bard you had to do two different before you
were the bard, or something like that.

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.440
-- It used to split strangely.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.650
They've definitely, in the newer additions, 
made it a lot easier to jump into things

00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:27.820
you wanted to.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.045
-- Back in my day,
you had to earn it.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.490
I'm just saying.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.480
-- You're not wrong.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.770
-- I'm original AD&D is all I'm saying.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.900
-- Heck yeah, man!

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.570
-- I was at GenCon when the Dungeon Master's guide
was released.

00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:41.400
-- Dude--

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.820
-- I have a copy signed by mister Gary Gygax.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.560
-- I am so jealous of that by the way.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.920
-- All right. It's not mine.
It's my friend Haskel Futenberg's.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.881
But they got mixed up at some point.

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.451
So Haskel. I've got the guide signed by Gary.

00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:54.271
If you want it, just let me know where you are.

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.261
-- Just make sure he doesn't see this video.

00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:57.540
-- Okay, good.

00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:02.600
-- The statistics remain the classic, similar zero to 18.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.070
-- Did you generate this for me randomly?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.360
-- These are actually stats that you could 
assign to it if you'd like.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.335
-- Okay, great.

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:10.600
-- So those were placed in.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.170
The main things is you got to remember is these numbers create these modifiers.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.520
So if ever you want to go ahead and I ask you

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:18.881
to make a strength check or a charisma check,

00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:21.501
you would roll your d20 and then add 
that number in the circle.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.631
-- Dig it, daddio.

00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:24.500
-- That would be your final number.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.810
-- I hear and I obey.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.950
-- There you go. You have your skills here, similar thing.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.760
If you have to make a skill check, you look at the number for the corresponding skill.

00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.310
-- Well, this is way more detailed than the old days.
-- Yeah.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.760
It's kind of expanded a bit.
So if I'm like--

00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.210
you're trying to be quiet and I'll say, "Roll a stealth check,"

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.440
you roll that and add your stealth modifier,
which is a plus three.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.300
-- Gotcha. Gotcha.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.140
-- Then you have your armor class,
you have your hit points,

00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.150
you have your initiative.
Those are all similar to the old set.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.580
-- Yep. I got that.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.860
When did you start playing?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.240
-- I started playing, I was 14.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.950
Which would've been '96 for me.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.971
-- Okay, yeah.

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.462
-- So yeah, 23 years for me.

00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:02.651
But still. Not quite as long as you,

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.140
but I've been invested heavily since.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.380
-- 1977. 1977, I think is when I started.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.640
-- Hell yeah.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.720
-- Matter of fact, all there was in D&D.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.120
You couldn't get D&D when I first started playing

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.581
because I was playing Metamorphosis Alpha.

00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:16.161
-- Oh, shit!
-- Do you know what that is?

00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:18.790
-- Yeah, yeah.
-- Which is basically Heinlein's universe ship.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.040
--Yeah.
-- But you know, the crew doesn't know--

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.640
I mean, the colonists don't know that
the crew are dead and you're in a ship,

00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.920
you're fighting mutants everywhere.

00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.261
-- That's so cool. That's where you started?

00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:29.971
-- We played metamorphosis Alpha first.

00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:32.620
Then we heard about this other thing called D&D, 
and so we played that.

00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:35.710
We went to World of Miniatures.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.600
That was the place that sold everything.
Went to World of Miniatures.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.410
Or Randy's Hobby Shop. One of those two.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.010
Anyway, that's the only place you could get them.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.485
And we started playing D&D.

00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:44.630
-- That's so cool.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.520
-- And all there was was the one pamphlet,
the one that's stapled.

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:50.010
Oh, those little ones were the extra modules.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.210
There was the basic. The basic was about this.

00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:56.050
And had the dragon on the front, rising up 
as the treasure--

00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.280
The--the, what's it called?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.630
The group that go together on the--

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.280
-- Oh, the adventuring party.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.850
-- The party. When the party come in.

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:09.370
And then after that came the little ones,
like Men and Magic,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.900
Gods, Demigods and Heroes.
-- Oh, yeah.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.629
And there was a third one, I can't remember it.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.630
-- Yeah. That was right before they got sued 
by the Tolkien estate for using hobbits and ents.

00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.190
-- Oh, that's right.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.650
-- Changed it to "halfling."

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:21.275
-- Then it became "halflings," exactly.
-- And "tree ents."

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:23.111
-- But they kept "orc."
-- They did.

00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:23.981
-- Yes.

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.740
-- Because technically there are other instances
of "orc" in literature.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.479
-- Sure.
-- Just not in that instance.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.310
-- Exactly. <i>Orcneas</i>. 
-- Yep.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.020
So yeah, that was an interesting time in D&D.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.850
-- All right. Sorry, I'm getting us sidetracked here.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.850
-- It's all good. I'm not complaining.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.870
So as a bard, your main thing is
that you're an entertainer.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.020
You're charismatic--

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.320
-- The one character class I never played 
in the old days, by the way.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.910
-- Well, thank the internet for that one.
-- Okay, great.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.570
-- Thanks guys.
-- Wait, the 'net voted me a bard?

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.400
-- Yep. They voted you a bard.
-- Thank you.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.300
-- They also voted you have a companion 
for this adventure.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.101
--Okay.

00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:59.451
There could been a various number of companions.
They chose for you to have a bee.

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:01.281
-- A bee?
-- You have a bee.

00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:03.062
-- Is it my familiar?
-- These are your stats for your bee.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.221
It has one hit point,

00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.140
but a higher armor class and it can 
sting things for some damage.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.340
-- Wow. And is this like--
remember the old familiars?

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.340
-- Oh yeah.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.950
-- Is it like a familiar? Can we communicate with it?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.190
-- You can talk with it, yeah. And they can talk back.
You can understand Bee.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.110
-- Okay, great.
-- And it is your friend.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.941
You can name it if you have a name for your bee,
if you'd like to decide.

00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:22.941
-- Eric.

00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:26.400
--Eric the bee. not the half a bee,
but the bee himself.

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:28.125
I like that. All right.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.360
And do you have a name and race of choice 
for your character?

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.010
-- I look--this illustration here, 
you'll get a shot of it later I assume.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.210
The illustration here--I look at least
half elvish.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.670
-- You could be half-elf.
-- I'll be a half-elf bard.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.420
-- So you can put down your character name
and your race right there.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.330
-- Okay.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.690
Oh, my name. My name.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.873
Character race.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.030
Half-elf.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.620
Character name. Um--

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.070
-- Choose wisely.
-- Yes, I know.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:07.743
Uh--

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.660
Capo.
-- Capo it is.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.020
Proper bard name. I love it.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.060
All right, so Capo the half-elf bard.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.510
So as a bard, you have a few things.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.090
You have your longsword with you

00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:30.410
if you have to roll an attack roll.
You just roll and add four.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.031
If it hits, then you roll your damage. The d8 plus two.

00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:36.851
Same with the crossbow, if you need to shoot
from a little further away.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.230
You have some abilities here called bardic inspiration.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.580
-- Once on your turn you can inspire an ally like Eric.
-- Yep.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.510
Granting them a 1d6 to add to a role.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.460
You can use this four times.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.420
Cutting words. When an enemy rolls an attack,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.790
you can use a bardic inspiration to insult them,

00:07:56.791 --> 00:08:00.360
resulting in 1d6 and subtracting it 
from their roll. Wow.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.350
-- So if an enemy's going to attack you, you
can use one of your bardic inspirations

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.250
to instead insult them, 
and possibly screw up their attack.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.400
-- Wow, wow, wow. Also called "throwing shade."
-- Very much so, yeah.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.931
-- Okay. Mm-hmm. It's a darkness spell.
All right.

00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.581
-- So each time you want to use that,
you can mark off one of these little things there

00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:16.420
for you to keep track of it.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.779
-- Oh, I dig it.
And what do we have over here?

00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:20.970
-- You have your bard spells.

00:08:20.971 --> 00:08:23.490
-- You don't have to dig too deep into them
if you want to.

00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:26.280
Vicious Mockery, you can use that spell 
as many times as you want.

00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:29.580
Both of these are cantrips.
You can use them in an infinite number of times.

00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:32.369
They're nice. They're not super powerful,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.360
but you got them in the back.
So you can hurt somebody by mocking them.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.750
-- Okay, okay.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.280
-- You have the spell Disguise Self

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.890
so you can transform what you 
look like for a short time.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.831
-- Sure, sure.

00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:46.150
-- To look like any other character that somewhat 
near your physical state.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.130
-- Right.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.240
-- Cure Wounds. Heal yourself or your bee friend 
if he's in dire straights.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.330
-- Got it.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.220
-- Thunderwave. You create a huge blast
of thunder that goes out for a 15 foot cone.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.830
So you can hit multiple enemies in front of you 
if you want to and do some damage.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.751
-- Does it do damage, or just stun?

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.311
-- It does damage and it pushes them away from you,
which is kind of nice.

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.261
And you got Tasha's Hideous Laughter,
which you can cast on somebody

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.110
and if they don't resist it, they
uncontrollably laugh to the point where

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.080
they can't attack or move, and you
can just wail on them if you want.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.810
-- Okay.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.200
-- So these are your cantrips.

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.670
These are your first level spells.

00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.690
You have four of them you can cast per day and you can choose any of these four.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.170
So you can cast Cure Wounds four times
if you want, or one each.

00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:28.580
Whenever you cast one of these spells,
you mark off one of your first levels.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.580
-- Got it.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.620
-- And then here's your second level. Invisibility.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.600
You can turn yourself invisible for up to an hour,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.100
but you become un-invisible if you attack something 
or cast a spell.

00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:38.580
-- Same. Same old, same old.
-- Yep.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.900
And then Suggestion,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:45.600
you just get to make a single one sentence suggestion 
to a creature that doesn't put it in serious harm.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.810
And if it fails, it takes--it can be like,
"Hey, you--go up to the top of that mountain."

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.810
"Okay."

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.210
And the orc just takes off for awhile.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.010
-- Gotcha. "Not the droids you're looking for."

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.220
-- Yeah, very much so.
-- Got it. Got it. Got it. All right.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.180
-- So that's what you have.
You can feel free to ask any questions.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.350
-- There were no props,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.850
but there were no cards.
The last time I played,

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:11.890
it was just you talking and us listening 
and then the charts. That was it.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.511
-- Yeah.
-- And then I've got the dice, yeah.

00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:16.981
-- And you know what?
Back then, not a lot of people played.

00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:17.661
-- No.

00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:18.860
(laughter)

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.690
-- Are you saying that's why? People like the props?

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.850
-- I'm saying it's definitely helped for people 
to be onboarded to a game.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.350
-- Sure. Yeah.
-- It was hard to describe.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.080
-- All right, let's do this thing.
-- All righty.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.080
-- Onward!

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.250
-- We begin in the hot summer months 
of the Menagerie Coast of Wildemount,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.250
the temperate kind of jungle,
coastal home of the beautiful city of Feolinn.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.490
It's a wine city known for its affordable timeshares 
and tourist boards.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.310
But also the nearby forest, the Plumgroves,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.510
where it gains most of its wonderful fruit for its wines.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:01.310
But you, Capo, you've been collecting errant bits of lore
of the history of the Plumgroves.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.391
And there was once a dark history
that cast a shadow over this beautiful forest.

00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:11.520
Where once there was a dark mage
who went mad, named Zathkira,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.390
who was trying to corrupt an ancient artifact
known as the Crimson Sphere of Generosity.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.650
In his attempts to convert this artifact,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.540
he began to draw various tourists down into 
a subterranean layer beneath this forest,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.160
never to be seen again, or to become his 
terrible corrupted minions.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.240
However, he was defeated by a great hero named Shiona,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.540
who was wielding the Exalting Blade of Favor.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.750
However, upon defeating this mage,
this laboratory vanished and was never found again,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.550
nor was the hero or the sword that she wielded.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.110
Now, this is just interesting information 
for anyone to have.

00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:51.300
And you being such a book-learned bard,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.470
you've been noticing strange disappearances recently,

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.530
very similar to this very tumultuous time
in Feolinn's history.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.710
No one else listening to you, you grow frustrated.
You gather your belongings,

00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:07.310
gathering your weapons, and gather 
your companion friend Eric, your bee,

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.360
to go ahead and see if you can find out 
the root of this terrible, rash

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.390
series of disappearances.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.970
So, gathering your things as you leave your home 
heading towards the Plumgroves,

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.520
you glance up and there, 
out of the corner of your eye--

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.823
(buzzing)

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.740
Eric lands on your shoulder, and you head your way into the forest.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.190
So is there anything you'd like to prepare 
or anything you'd like to do

00:12:31.191 --> 00:12:33.081
upon your journey into the forest?

00:12:33.081 --> 00:12:35.511
-- What supplies do I have going to the forest?

00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.990
-- On your equipment right there, you have those supplies.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.520
-- Backpack, studded leather, armor, Thieve's Tools,
torch x3, bedrool, flint and steel, waterskin,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.310
50 feet of rope, and grappling hook.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.731
-- I'm good.
-- You're good?

00:12:50.731 --> 00:12:51.571
-- I'm good.
-- All right.

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:52.401
-- All right.

00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:54.540
-- So, as you make your way into the forest,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.970
Eric comes up to your ear and starts
talking to you about stuff in the day.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.200
[buzz-like talking]

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.210
You, understanding Bee, can hear
exactly what he's saying.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.131
So you have a nice conversation.

00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:08.201
-- Can Eric scout for me?
-- He can, yeah.

00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:10.701
-- Can he go out ahead of me?
-- If you'd like to, yeah.

00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:13.220
Bees can be great scouts.
They fit in well in forests.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.560
-- All right. Hard to hit?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.100
And they have compound eyes, so they can see a lot.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.730
-- Oh, quite a bit actually.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.630
-- Okay. So, we're on the edge of the forest, I assume?

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.630
-- Yes.
-- Okay.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.080
The Plumgroves.
-- The Plumgroves.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.020
-- Are the fruit on the tree?

00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:31.715
Is it--is it the season for plums?

00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:35.690
-- Actually it's off season at the time.
There are a few there, but they're ripe

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.460
and probably not ready for the picking.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.430
-- Okay. All right, all right.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.750
They're a bit ripe, so they're overripe.
They're prunes?

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.430
-- Yes.
-- It's a Prunegrove. Okay.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.380
-- I send Eric in first.
-- Okay.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.020
-- I send him in.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.020
Can I direct him? Go in 50 yards,
and come back.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.101
-- Sure. Go ahead and roll a d20 to see how Eric's capabilities--

00:13:59.101 --> 00:14:00.101
-- Five.

00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:03.110
-- Five. Eric returns saying-- [buzzing]

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.990
-- Everything's good?

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.670
All right. I follow him on the path that he just took.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.670
-- Okay. So you guys begin making your way deeper,

00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:13.270
deeper into the Plumgrove, the
shaded canopy of the forest itself

00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:16.860
keeping a good portion of the sunlight 
from reaching you directly.

00:14:16.861 --> 00:14:20.040
It is beautiful. It's cooler.
The temperature drops as you progress forward.

00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:24.160
The smell of fermenting fruit gets strong on your nose.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.320
Eventually you find a small clearing.
Starting to feel a little hungry. Have a little snack.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.610
Eric feels confident, 
nothing's a problem in the area.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.230
[conversational buzzing]

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.290
-- Okay.
-- Go ahead and roll a perception check for me.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.820
-- 20?
-- Yep.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.680
-- 12.

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:44.620
A 12. And your perception score is plus--?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.360
-- Perception is plus zero.
-- Plus zero, so a standard 12. Okay.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.320
So as you're stopping for a moment and
enjoying your sandwich, Eric has

00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:56.051
and Eric is getting a bit of pollen off to the side,

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:59.730
you hear out of the left corner of your peripheral--

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.580
[growling]

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.980
-- I draw my sword.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.280
-- You draw your sword and glance over just in time 
to see a mass of black fur

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.580
just leap out of the woods in your direction.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.441
You need to roll initiative for me, friend.

00:15:16.111 --> 00:15:17.591
-- It's still 20?
-- Still d20, yeah.

00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:20.610
-- 13.
-- 13, okay.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.641
-- Plus--do I have any--
-- Initiative modifier's right there.

00:15:23.641 --> 00:15:25.181
-- Plus two, okay, so, 15.

00:15:25.211 --> 00:15:27.370
-- You go first.
You actually beat this creature.

00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:30.970
You glance around to see a large black-furred panther.

00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:34.060
But you see--in the split second that leaps towards you,

00:15:34.061 --> 00:15:36.490
it's jaws open, it's teeth slavering down--

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.580
part of its face is scraped off and you see bone.

00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:41.500
It doesn't appear to be entirely alive.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.670
But you have the draw. What are you doing?

00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:45.935
-- Uh, uh, hack and chop.

00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:49.860
-- Okay! Go ahead and roll an attack with your longsword.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.350
-- Again, 20?
-- d20, yeah.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.823
-- It's been awhile.
-- It's all good.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.680
-- Oh!

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.620
-- Oh no!

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.540
(laughter)

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.190
-- Two!
-- Add your--

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.190
-- Two plus four.

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:02.635
-- Six.
-- Six!

00:16:02.635 --> 00:16:05.590
It catches you off guard and you try and swing wide,
but find your body battered to the side.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.650
You tumble and drag to the ground
right as it pounces on top of you.

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:12.730
The panther creature is now-- [growling]
right over you.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.060
However Eric gets a turn on your turn as well.
So what would you like Eric to do?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.250
-- Sting him in the eye.
-- Go for it.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.900
So go ahead roll an attack for Eric.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:21.955
-- Three!

00:16:21.955 --> 00:16:23.220
-- [laughing] Plus six!

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.770
-- It's going to be a brief adventure friends.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.290
I'd really love to help Red Nose Day more than this,

00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:31.080
but it looks like we're going to be knocked out pretty soon.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080
-- Yeah, we'll see.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.300
So, Eric attempts to swing down 
and try and jam into the eye.

00:16:34.301 --> 00:16:35.800
However, he does sting the eye,

00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:39.640
but the eye doesn't seem to be really alive anymore.

00:16:39.641 --> 00:16:42.510
It's dangling out of the socket.
It seems to be clouded over.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.350
It doesn't have an effect on the creature.

00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:46.221
So now it's the creature's turn.

00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:50.010
Pinned on your chest, it's going to attempt to
try and bite down towards you.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.580
That is going to be a 13 to hit.
What's your armor class?

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.750
-- My armor class is 14.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.120
-- 14. Putting up your blade, 
you just manage to keep it off

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.910
and throw it to the side.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.619
Tumbles off, catches itself, whips around again.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.310
It's your turn.
What are you doing?

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.390
-- Let's Thunderwave this bad boy.
-- Okay, all right!

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.300
It goes and runs towards you to leap once more 
as you pull up your hands and cast Thunderwave.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.479
This giant wave of force energy blasts out in front of you.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:23.020
So you deal--it says there 2d8 thunder damage.

00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:25.720
-- 2d8 thunder damage.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.920
-- Does not make its saving throw.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.211
-- 10. Six and four.

00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.901
10 points of thunder damage.

00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:36.000
You watch as it leaps in the air, its jaws open,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.821
its claws extended towards you--

00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:39.781
--as it blasts outward.

00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:42.640
You actually shake the flesh off of its bones.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.710
It scatters into a large spray of dark ichor and bone.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.150
And this little skull of this panther,
scrape to the ground and roll at the base of your foot,

00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:55.320
and roll at the base of your foot, destroyed.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.981
-- I haven't heard the word "ichor" in almost 30 years.

00:18:00.221 --> 00:18:01.451
-- Welcome back.

00:18:01.451 --> 00:18:03.050
-- Okay, okay, okay.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.930
Is there anything--

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.790
I search the remains.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.280
Okay. Roll a d20 and make a perception check for me.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.940
-- 19.
-- Ooh!

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.460
-- Plus perception--

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.860
I've got no pluses. 19.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.860
-- 19, that's great.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.130
So looking through the corpse, you can see that
it's been dead for a while.

00:18:21.131 --> 00:18:26.050
But seeing as how it was manifest in this kind of actual living seeming form,

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.550
there was some dark magic that
iseems to be animating it from this nearby space.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.670
Wit that check as well, you 
You also looked at, in the struggle,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.761
your Thunderwave struck a 
nearby small rocky hillside cliff

00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:41.560
and knocked a series of thick vines off the surface.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.670
And you can see now, revealed, a small entryway,
a cavern, that dives deeper

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.500
into the subterranean regions beneath the Plumgroves.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.191
-- Is there a door or just an opening?

00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:55.641
-- It's an opening, but it looks like 
it was carved to be almost like a door.

00:18:55.641 --> 00:18:58.991
All right, can I--do we still have listening?
Is that still something we do?

00:18:58.991 --> 00:19:02.160
-- That's your perception, if you'd like to.
-- I'd like to go listen at the door.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160
-- Okay.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:04.890
--16.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.980
-- Okay. You put your ear up to it and listen carefully.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.410
Nothing comes. But there was a bit of a faint breeze,

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.810
like this kind of distant echoing whine from deeper within.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.880
-- Okay, Eric, let's go. Let's go in.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.880
[buzzing]

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.100
Okay? Sword out.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.060
Sword out, all righty.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.060
As you open the door,
looking inside this chamber,

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.980
you can see this long, heavy, rocky, winding path

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.850
that leads lower and lower into the earth. You--

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.440
-- Is it carved as steps or is it just a--?
-- Right now it's natural.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.950
It's just a natural, slight grade that 
heads further and further down inside.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:55.220
There's a faint whiff of rot along with
stagnant hard water that catches your nose.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.750
You continue on for about five or so minutes carefully keeping an eye out,

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.150
sword at the ready, Eric stinger forward.

00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:07.310
-- It's not easy to fly that way.
-- It is not.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.630
But he's a very trained bee.
-- He's using his abs.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.583
[laughter]

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:17.500
The chilled breeze hits you just as you find this pathway open up into another

00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:19.630
chamber about 70 feet across.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.700
You can see a series of stalagmites hang from the ceiling 
slick with interior moisture.

00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:27.070
-- Tites, mites. Sorry.

00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:29.240
-- Damn, I always mess that up.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.380
-- This is what it was like to play D&D with me when I was 13.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.380
-- There you go.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.870
-- C'mon man, those are stalag<i>mites</i>.
-- Damn right.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.985
-- Where the stalag<i>mites</i> would be--

00:20:39.985 --> 00:20:40.702
-- Yes?

00:20:40.742 --> 00:20:44.396
-- You see instead a large dark pit, lightless before you.

00:20:44.896 --> 00:20:47.880
-- So I'm on the edge of the pit?
-- You're on the edge of the cliff,

00:20:47.901 --> 00:20:52.210
and you can see two stone imps that are
wedged into the sides of the wall.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.420
A single rope bridge goes across this chasm 
where to pitons hold it on the opposite end.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.750
-- Do not f***ing get on that bridge.
That's what I've learned.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.070
Do I have any other--what other--

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.450
Let's see, what do I got here?

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.400
I got nothing. I got nothing. I got nothing.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.910
Eric, go fly to see how--

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.490
Can I see how long this bridge is
or does it go off into the dark?

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.861
-- You can see the bridge goes for about 60 or so feet.

00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:23.051
Because you are a half-elf, you do have the ability
to see through--

00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:25.305
infravision, as you would recall.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.390
-- Oh, nice. I forgot about that.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.340
I send Eric out to go see what's 
on the other side of that bridge.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.235
-- Okay.

00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:39.270
[buzzing]

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.450
Eric heads off into the darkness 
and scouts out the opposite side.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.211
It seems that across the bridge there is another opening

00:21:47.211 --> 00:21:51.090
that leads to a slowly spiraling rock tunnel heading lower and lower,

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.730
but you have to cross the chamber to get to it.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.283
-- Hmm.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.700
-- Crazy question.
-- Yes.

00:22:00.755 --> 00:22:03.605
Eric, as a bee, doesn't have any particular--

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.510
he can't carry a length of rope, can he?

00:22:07.145 --> 00:22:09.125
-- You can certainly try.

00:22:09.687 --> 00:22:12.597
[laughter]

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:17.040
I would like to see if Eric could take one length 
of my rope and bring it

00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:18.611
to the other side of the bridge.

00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:20.071
Okay. Eric returns.
You go ahead and hold the rope.

00:22:20.071 --> 00:22:21.160
Eric grabs it.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160
[buzz]
[thump]

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.290
-- Can't do it.
-- Can't do it. He's a bee.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.791
-- All right. How far is it from me to the other side?

00:22:26.791 --> 00:22:28.111
-- 60 feet.
-- 60 feet.

00:22:28.111 --> 00:22:31.790
I only got a 50 foot rope.
That's not smart.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.140
Okay, so here's what I'll do.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:34.780
-- Yes.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.060
-- I assume there are posts on this side of the bridge.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.060
-- There are, yes.
-- Okay.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.970
-- I tie the rope to these posts.
-- Okay.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.700
-- Tie another length of the rope around my waist.

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.770
Or make a harness, you know?
-- Yeah, yeah.

00:22:49.005 --> 00:22:52.085
-- Loop it around, I know how to harness myself.
I'm a damn half-elf.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.571
And then I--I start crossing the bridge.

00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:57.461
--Okay.

00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:01.080
-- Wait, wait. I go back to where I started.
Back to where I started.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.591
Tell me about these imps again.

00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:05.051
-- You see these two stone imps,

00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:06.501
they look roughly hewn.

00:23:06.501 --> 00:23:08.011
Not a lot of fine craftsmanship went into them.

00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:10.280
Which as a bard, you are discerning about art craft.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.810
You're a little disappointed that it looks so rough.

00:23:12.811 --> 00:23:15.870
But they're both embedded slightly in the wall 
and just appear to be stationary.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.200
-- And can I get to them, or does the edge 
of the pit go straight up

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.250
underneath where the imps are?

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.640
-- It goes underneath where the imps are.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.030
They're not within range to you, unfortunately.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.400
Not within, like--physically.
Your crossbow could probably reach them.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.800
-- Are there any rocks around or anything like that?

00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:34.461
--Yeah, there's a few rocks you can find 
around you on the floor. Yeah.

00:23:34.461 --> 00:23:37.210
-- I whip a rock at one of the stone imps.

00:23:37.235 --> 00:23:40.055
-- Okay, roll a d20 for me, add your dexterity modifier.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.560
-- It didn't quite do the thing.
-- Go ahead and roll again.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.560
-- Okay.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.250
-- 14 plus plus dexterity? 16.

00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:51.661
-- 16. You chuck the rock.

00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:55.635
It hits the imp. It crooks to one side.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.570
It's now partially dangling off from its perch where it was sitting.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.660
-- Do it again.
-- Roll again.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.220
-- 16. Plus two, 18.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.670
-- Whack! You slam it with a rock and--

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.540
it tumbles out of its little nook and 
you hear it vanish into the darkness below before--

00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:21.060
[splash] into water.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:23.853
-- Okay.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.350
-- Now there's one imp.
-- There's one imp.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.980
-- All right. So I'll tie the rope to one of the posts.
And I'll start to make my crossing.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.971
-- Okay.

00:24:35.531 --> 00:24:38.301
You tie to the post and make your way 
across the rope bridge.

00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:40.020
Creaks from side to side.

00:24:41.671 --> 00:24:45.820
Carefully, you make it about halfway there 
and you see this very faint pinkish-purple glow

00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:46.800
on the right side.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.680
You glance over and see the eyes of the imp
are flaring up towards your direction.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.030
-- Okay. Yeah. All right.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.940
[laughter]

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.060
-- But only one imp.
-- Only one imp.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.130
Okay. I go faster and I tell Eric 
to keep an eye on that damn imp.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.970
-- Okay. Are you still attached by the rope on your waist?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.190
-- Yeah, I'm going to go all the way,
as far as I can, attached by the rope.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.320
-- Okay. You get about 40 feet because you've used 
some of your 10 feet of your 50 foot length

00:25:10.321 --> 00:25:13.260
to tie yourself to the post.
-- I'll accept your judgment.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.850
You stop at that point.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.920
Right as this large burst of arcane energy 
blasts out of the side of the imp in your direction.

00:25:20.885 --> 00:25:21.885
[inhales]

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.403
You take--

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.940
Three points of arcane damage 
as it hits you in the right shoulder,

00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:31.210
almost throwing you off the bridge.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:37.630
Also, I would like you to roll a percentile dice 
for me right there if you don't mind.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.260
-- Uh, which one is which?

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.330
-- So that's 55.
-- 55, okay, great.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.650
Okay, so the blast of arcane energy off your shoulder

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.230
emits this burst of fire that nearly--but does not--

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.613
catch the rope bridge.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.540
You see its eyes now glowing a second time,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.180
preparing for a second blast, what are you doing?

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.390
-- Cut the rope and run.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.950
-- Okay, so you cut the rope and go running past,

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.530
Eric's scooting up behind you, (buzzing)

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.980
as fast as he can.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.740
Right as you get to the edge of the rope bridge,

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.940
it fires another blast in your direction,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.680
but with a natural four it fails,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.310
you just duck and tumble out of the way, (impacts)

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.790
it hits the side of the dirt, causing rocks to fly up

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.790
and spray off of the nearby side,

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:18.960
but you are across the bridge,

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.610
and Eric (buzzing) catches up to you,

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.910
safe and sound on the opposite side.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:24.743
-- All right.

00:26:24.743 --> 00:26:27.710
So I've taken three hits points of damage.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:28.751
-- Correct.

00:26:28.751 --> 00:26:30.920
-- What's going on with the glowing eyes

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.810
of the imp at this point?

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.537
-- They have faded.
-- Okay.

00:26:33.537 --> 00:26:37.630
Is there anything in the present form of D&D

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.000
I can use to heal myself?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.100
-- You have Cure Wounds as a spell you can do.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.974
-- [reading] equal to 1d8, I'll wait.

00:26:45.974 --> 00:26:47.126
-- You'll wait.
-- I'll wait.

00:26:47.126 --> 00:26:48.172
-- Okay.

00:26:48.172 --> 00:26:50.490
-- 'Cause chances are, on average I'd cure myself

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.432
more than I've hurt.

00:26:51.432 --> 00:26:53.870
That's actually a very good point.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.623
All right, so, now crossing and heading down

00:26:55.623 --> 00:26:58.140
into the next dark rocky cavern--

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.750
-- I cannot begin to tell you where this is taking me,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.139
these feelings right now.

00:27:02.139 --> 00:27:03.780
(Matt laughing)

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.613
-- Hopefully positive.

00:27:04.613 --> 00:27:06.090
-- Very positive, very positive, yeah,

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.120
but also extremely insecure.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.120
--Don't be, you're doing great.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.710
-- No, no, no, because I'm going back

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.117
to my teenage years right now.

00:27:12.117 --> 00:27:13.260
Oh. (laughing)

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.263
-- I can feel chest hairs growing as we speak.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.540
-- Well here you go, you're reclaiming it

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.610
for your modern self.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.533
-- Exactly, exactly, yeah.

00:27:20.533 --> 00:27:22.260
-- All right. So.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.400
-- Old skills coming out.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.530
-- Yeah, you're doing good.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.480
So, the next hall you turn into, it would probably be about

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.550
60 or so feet, a slow spiral downward opens up

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.070
into a small crystalline chamber.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.610
You can see reflective glass and onyx pillars

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.129
that rise up in various places.

00:27:37.129 --> 00:27:39.323
The textures in the cavern are jagged, warped,

00:27:39.323 --> 00:27:41.550
with light refracting against them

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.600
ever so slightly from faint torches and sconces

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.408
that are burrowed into the side walls.

00:27:45.408 --> 00:27:46.340
-- Of course.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.038
-- You gotta have torches in there.

00:27:48.038 --> 00:27:52.450
-- Nowhere in the universe is there as much onyx and obsidian

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:53.900
as there is in a D&D module.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.086
-- Damn right.
-- Exactly.

00:27:55.086 --> 00:27:56.090
(laughing)

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.122
-- Best possible stone, why wouldn't you want onyx?

00:27:58.122 --> 00:27:59.751
(Matt laughs)

00:27:59.751 --> 00:28:02.110
So, along the kind of sunken earthen floors,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.157
you can see scattered bits of bone in small piles

00:28:04.157 --> 00:28:06.900
just kind of tossed around, as well as what looks to be--

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.740
-- Human bones?

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.028
-- It could be, you'd have to go check in person.

00:28:10.028 --> 00:28:12.590
You also notice occasionally put around there,

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.470
small red spheres about that big

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.640
that are dull and cracked in places,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.340
kind of amongst the bones.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.620
On the opposite side of this chamber,

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.310
about 30 feet from you, you can see what looks to be

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.033
some sort of a sarcophagus or a stone tomb

00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:29.070
that has gold gilding and scrolling around the outside of it

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.020
and what looks to be a single blade placed through the top.

00:28:34.454 --> 00:28:35.890
-- And the floor itself?

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.270
-- The floor itself is mostly clear of earth,

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.577
you just see like bits of scattered bone

00:28:39.577 --> 00:28:41.910
and these little dull red spheres.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.050
-- And when you say crystalline chamber, you mean the walls--

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.440
-- The walls are crystalline.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.273
-- Okay.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.760
-- Examine the bones.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.733
-- Okay, go ahead and make a medicine check for me,

00:28:51.733 --> 00:28:54.563
-- just roll a d20 and then add your wisdom modifier.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.096
-- Six plus--

00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.766
negative one, five.

00:29:01.766 --> 00:29:03.200
(Matt laughing)

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.957
-- Them's some bones.

00:29:04.957 --> 00:29:08.320
That's some bones right there on that floor.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.020
Something died. And those were in them.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.110
-- Okay, I have no idea what kind of animal

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.180
or creature this is.
-- You don't.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.360
-- Okay, I look at one of the dull red spheres.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.193
-- Okay.

00:29:19.193 --> 00:29:20.850
As you approach and get within a foot of it,

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.203
you watch as it rolls for a second in your direction, stops.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.170
-- I take a step backwards.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.747
-- You watch a little line appear across the front of it

00:29:28.747 --> 00:29:31.097
and it rolls a little faster in your direction.

00:29:31.991 --> 00:29:35.290
It's now rolling really quickly towards you on the ground.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.123
-- Okay.

00:29:37.723 --> 00:29:39.360
I run to the tomb.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.577
-- Okay, so you just go into a full sprint past.

00:29:40.577 --> 00:29:42.250
-- Full sprint, full sprint.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.740
-- As you're running towards the tomb you watch

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.460
as about six or seven of these spheres

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.470
begin to roll out of the piles of bones towards you.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.017
You watch the line where the crack was open up

00:29:49.017 --> 00:29:51.990
and you see small rows of serrated teeth, (snarling).

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.560
It starts leaping and rolling towards you.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.740
In your research of the Crimson Sphere of Generosity,

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.070
these must be discarded attempts

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.710
that failed at recreating its magic

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.310
that are now small mites rushing towards you.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.930
Seven of these are gonna leap at you

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.940
as you try and rush past.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.037
The first one, that's gonna be--

00:30:08.037 --> 00:30:09.240
-- (whispers) Seven.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.610
-- That's gonna be a 14, I believe that hits.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.430
-- Okay, but they can't do a <i>lot</i> of damage.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.420
-- That one does one point of damage.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.970
You kick it off the side of your boot.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.240
The second one, that would be an 11.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.350
This one was not even an issue, it just misses you,

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.340
whiffing past. Another set, a pair of them,

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.343
go leaping towards your face.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.680
Three, and okay--one of them you manage to bat

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.010
out of the way, the other one

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.956
does latch onto the side of your face,

00:30:33.956 --> 00:30:38.510
and with that one you take another one point of damage.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.343
-- Okay.

00:30:39.343 --> 00:30:41.330
-- The last three are now rolling towards you,

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.030
coming from the front of the tomb.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.720
With a nine, which misses your armor class,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.550
a four, which misses your armor class,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.280
and a 15, which hits.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.430
So you manage to just dodge out of the way of two of them,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.330
and the final one leaps right towards you

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.900
and latches onto your chin for four points

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.880
of piercing damage.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.001
-- Man!

00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:03.530
15, if I've got that math right, I'm down to 15 here.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.710
-- You rip it off the chin, throw it,

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.130
it shatters against the crystal floor,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.360
but however, you stop at the base of the tomb,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.830
look around you, and all the rest of them

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.430
have come to rest, apparently no longer

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.580
aware of your presence.

00:31:13.952 --> 00:31:14.785
-- Okay.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.210
I observe, I look at the tomb, any carvings, any messages?

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.550
-- You don't see any language on it,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.510
you do see beautiful scrolling around the sides of it,

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.110
and on the top of it, you see what looks to be

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.960
a sculptured relief of a female warrior

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.660
in beautiful armor, the sword itself

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.090
seemingly almost plunged through the chest,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.760
but she's holding it in a peaceful expression.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.660
As you kind of approach--

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.630
-- She's holding the sword--

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.621
-- Holding the sword like this, yeah.

00:31:39.621 --> 00:31:42.590
As you begin to look over it, you hear this faint,

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.270
strange, ethereal voice, kind of come

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.263
sourcelessly around you.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.633
"Walk this path towards your own destruction."

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.720
You see a ghostly apparition appear of a female knight.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.500
Her golden armor and beautiful dark skin

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.150
now manifest in a pale blue ethereal glow.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.430
You recognize this to be, most likely, Shiona,

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.780
the warrior that previously defeated this mage.

00:32:12.342 --> 00:32:17.342
"Beware, for this tomb will claim you as it has claimed many.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.740
"As it has claimed me, the fool, the victorious.

00:32:24.046 --> 00:32:29.766
"He has risen in unlife, and I am bound to my grave,

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.053
"my shame."

00:32:33.763 --> 00:32:35.613
And the ghost just looks towards you.

00:32:37.265 --> 00:32:38.720
(buzzing)

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.870
Eric's a little scared.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.840
-- What's the scrollwork around--I look at

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.400
the scrollwork around the edge.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.970
Okay, make an intelligence check for me,

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.870
roll a d20, add your intelligence modifier.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:59.347
-- 11 plus intelligence of 12, so 13. 12.

00:32:59.347 --> 00:33:00.200
-- 12, okay.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.770
Looking around it, gather that this is a ward of protection.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.710
This isn't a language, because these are like

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.280
simple arcane runes that are meant as a means

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.363
of either containing or protecting a holy space.

00:33:18.046 --> 00:33:20.750
-- Is the sword a sword, or is it also carved of stone?

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.540
-- It is a sword, it is a beautiful sword

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.603
of gold and silver inlay, the hilt is intricate.

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.647
-- All kinds of reasons why this could turn bad,

00:33:27.647 --> 00:33:29.060
but let's pull that sword out.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:29.893
-- Okay.

00:33:29.893 --> 00:33:31.810
As you reach for the sword, the spirit suddenly

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.560
flares angrily.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.310
"This blade has brought down the terror of Zathkira once,

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.367
"but I will not see it in the hands of one unworthy.

00:33:40.367 --> 00:33:45.367
"You tell me, what do you fight for?

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.720
"What is so precious that you would

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.393
"throw your life away in these pits of despair?"

00:33:52.971 --> 00:33:55.870
-- I fight to alleviate children's poverty.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.870
-- "Then your heart is pure and driven.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.433
"The Exalting Blade of Favor is yours, Capo.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.400
"Young bard, take it, and finish what I could not."

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.489
And you watch the specter slowly dissipate into the air,

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.770
the blade now there for the taking.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.530
-- I remove the blade.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.706
-- It comes out with a shiny flash of divine energy.

00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:22.719
It hums for a second.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:25.139
You feel its magical essence connect

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.050
through your wrist and your arm, and for a moment,

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.489
there's a surge of energy and purpose through your body.

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:33.650
You hear the blade almost speaking to you,

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.750
directly to your mind.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.980
It says:

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.630
"Hey hey, my man!

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.920
"You're pretty bold, bro.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.679
"You got what it takes, and I cannot wait

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:43.560
"for the world to see.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.683
"Let's do this! Woo!"

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.630
-- I love a talking sword.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.570
-- There is your Exalted Blade.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.768
Exalting Blade of Faith.

00:34:51.768 --> 00:34:55.409
Exalting Blade, so it exalts me.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:56.578
-- Yeah.
-- Wow.

00:34:56.578 --> 00:35:00.320
The Blade of Favor, you gain fire and lightning resistance.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.291
-- Yep.
-- Okay.

00:35:01.291 --> 00:35:03.740
That's a hint of things to come.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.995
-- It may or may not be.

00:35:04.995 --> 00:35:06.744
-- No, it is 100 percent.
-- Of course it is, yeah.

00:35:06.744 --> 00:35:08.230
You only have 30 minutes for this, so.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.800
-- That's fantastic.
(Matt laughing)

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.653
Okay, attack, plus six to hit,

00:35:13.926 --> 00:35:17.880
1d10 plus five radiant damage?

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.713
-- Correct.

00:35:18.713 --> 00:35:20.510
-- So we'll find out that is when I use it,

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.848
but I assume there's some sort of blast force.

00:35:22.848 --> 00:35:23.681
-- Could be.

00:35:23.681 --> 00:35:25.455
-- Could--we'll see, all right.

00:35:25.455 --> 00:35:26.288
(laughing)

00:35:26.288 --> 00:35:28.290
How many times do I get to use 
any of these spells, just once?

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.835
-- You've used Thunderwave once, so you can mark off that.

00:35:30.835 --> 00:35:33.420
-- So I can use each of them four times?

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.060
-- Each of these here, a total of four through all of them.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.210
-- Right, Thunderwave would've been good

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.350
for those little red balls.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.390
That would've been good for it,

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.460
but you have three more of these you can cast

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.460
and two of these you can cast.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.323
Your choice.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.510
-- Okie smokey.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:51.030
Okay, so is there an exit to this tomb that we're in?

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.230
-- Just beyond this tomb you can see what looks to be

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.170
another doorway.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.630
It is of a dark marbled wood with what looks like

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:01.400
silver and gold veins kind of almost grown through it.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.421
-- Okay.

00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:03.959
Let's go over to the doorway.

00:36:03.959 --> 00:36:05.750
-- Okay, you go to the door. (clicks)

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.583
It's locked.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.510
-- Listen at the door.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.413
-- Okay, make a Perception check for me.

00:36:13.213 --> 00:36:14.590
-- Two.
(Matt laughs)

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.130
I am stone deaf.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.511
-- You're like, all right. Seems safe.

00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:22.178
(both laughing)

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.689
-- Very first time I ever heard anybody talk about D&D,

00:36:27.689 --> 00:36:31.780
I think it was Roy Slachiver and Haskell Fudenberg

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.340
and Keith Sargi having an argument

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.511
over whether or not they should've been able to hear

00:36:35.511 --> 00:36:38.781
the giant rats that were in the room

00:36:38.781 --> 00:36:40.757
they listened to the night before.

00:36:40.757 --> 00:36:42.790
I'm like what do you mean, listened to?

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.770
Because listening was a part of Metamorphosis Alpha.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.330
It was like, what do you mean listening?

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:47.385
How did you listen?

00:36:47.385 --> 00:36:48.785
(murmuring)

00:36:48.785 --> 00:36:49.618
Like that.

00:36:49.618 --> 00:36:50.740
And I'm like, I want in!

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.893
So listening, I always listen, it's a big thing for me.

00:36:52.893 --> 00:36:54.913
-- Heck yeah, no man, it's important, when you roll well.

00:36:54.913 --> 00:36:56.500
-- "The rats were big enough, we would've heard them

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.880
scratching around."
(laughing)

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.220
Okay, so, I can't open the door and I can't

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.799
hear a damn thing.

00:37:03.799 --> 00:37:04.890
-- Well the door is locked, at least.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.013
Oh, it's locked.

00:37:06.021 --> 00:37:07.231
I don't have any--

00:37:07.231 --> 00:37:09.945
Bards don't have any lockpicking skills
or anything like that--

00:37:09.945 --> 00:37:11.492
Do they have thief skills?

00:37:11.492 --> 00:37:14.382
Oh, torch, thieves' tools!

00:37:14.382 --> 00:37:15.940
Bards have thief powers?

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.430
-- Anybody can have thieves' tools,

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.410
just rogues are really really good at that.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.930
-- Okay, so let's try to pick the lock.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.830
-- Okay, roll a d20, add your Dexterity modifier.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:28.027
14 plus Dexterity of 15, 16.

00:37:28.027 --> 00:37:29.580
-- 16, it takes you a little bit of time,

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.114
but you eventually find this older, somewhat rusted lock

00:37:34.114 --> 00:37:36.843
not that difficult to pick. (creaks)

00:37:36.843 --> 00:37:40.840
It opens before you, this cold, howling wind

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.230
scraping across the stonework of the interior

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.380
of this chamber. (inhales)

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.260
Just kinda moans out in your direction.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.960
An ominous portent to what lays within.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.556
But the blade comes to you and goes,

00:37:52.556 --> 00:37:55.960
"Don't worry man, you got this. Trust me, you got this."

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.642
-- Does the blade give off any light or anything?

00:37:58.642 --> 00:38:00.730
-- Would you like to will it to?

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.970
-- I will the blade to give off light.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:03.830
(whooshes)

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:07.640
It emanates, the equivalent of bright torchlight

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.480
in the area.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.780
-- And I hold it in front of me as I go into the room,

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.820
to illuminate my path.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.660
-- Okay.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.380
As you step within the chamber, you can see what looks to be

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.350
stairs that curl downward briefly into the Exandrian earth,

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.590
the stench of decay itself intense as it lingers

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.250
with almost like an old incense that had burned long ago

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.650
and barely hangs in the air.

00:38:30.557 --> 00:38:34.760
You kind of follow the steps downward around the side

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.760
before it opens up into a large domed interior.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.960
From what you can see in here,

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.120
it's a laboratory or a sanctum of some kind.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.890
You can see the smooth, dark stone floor,

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.990
there are perimeter tables that carry all manner

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:53.990
of intricate glass-tubed alchemical setups and supplies

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.970
with little brass mechanisms that spark

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.510
blue and white in places.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.740
On the furthest left-hand corner you can see a table

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.670
where corpses are piled onto it.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.890
-- Fresh corpses?

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.550
-- Fresh-ish, from what you can see at this distance,

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:12.690
and a figure hunched over it, long black and red robes,

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:15.262
you can see them kind of billowing past the shoulders,

00:39:15.262 --> 00:39:17.850
the skin itself sickly and pale,

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.800
parts of it seemingly almost torn.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.390
Long bony fingers pulling apart one of these corpses

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.990
as you can see the hooded figure kind of peering through.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:28.490
"Where do these creatures hide their generosity?

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.390
"It's stored somewhere within their gallbladder, maybe?

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.223
"Bah."

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.660
The creature turns and reveals its ghastly decomposing head.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:41.110
A thin, pale face, torn skin, sickly yellow eyes,

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.630
the pupils clouded over and invisible amongst the rest

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.970
of this disgusting look.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.610
You can see a bulbous red shiny orb

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.349
affixed to the front of its face.

00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:55.140
"You, foolish guest. (chuckles)

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:59.633
"Help me unlock this strange relic's power.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.360
"Where do you dumb muling mortals

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.070
"hide your generosity, anyway, eh?

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:09.210
"I need to figure out how to get this blasted thing to work!"

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.910
-- So I'm guessing this is Zathkira, that's my guess.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.560
-- You have done enough research, and can sense from

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.000
the people that speak of his terrible,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.290
annoying voice, this is probably him,

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.510
though in a different form of unlife.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.530
-- Okay, all right.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.790
And that is the Crimson Orb of Generosity.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.840
-- On his face, yes.
-- On his face, okay.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.830
I--I--hmm.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.833
So he's asked me where we mortals hide our generosity.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:51.033
I say, I will tell you, but first I need the orb.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.289
Give me the orb and I will tell you.

00:40:55.289 --> 00:40:56.570
(mumbling)

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.530
Make a Persuasion check. (chuckles)

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:00.363
-- Okay.

00:41:01.538 --> 00:41:04.090
-- Roll a d20 and add your Persuasion skill.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:04.923
-- Yeah, okay.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.223
Oh, not very well, five.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.150
And Persuasion, plus six, so 11.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:18.013
-- He seems a bit wary of the request and goes,

00:41:18.996 --> 00:41:21.230
"well, just a second, what is it that you

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.340
"would do with such a sphere?

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.150
"Ah, you must understand, I've worked very hard to attain it,

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.660
"and well, you're within moments of having

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.990
"your life stripped of your body,

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:36.470
"so what do you hope to unlock from me granting it to you?"

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.620
-- I will unlock all of its powers.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.243
What do you need from the orb?

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.930
"You have to understand.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.990
"I spent a lot of time with it.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.650
"Talking to it, trying to make it breakfast,

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:50.680
"whatever things generous people do,

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.160
I don't know how it works.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.570
"So I just hope maybe you, who carry

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.320
"such a small strange creature,"

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.580
and Eric kind of gets a little defensive, (buzzing)

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.040
up on your shoulder, "Maybe you would have more of an idea

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.820
"of what generosity might spark or inspire its effects."

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.820
As he pulls it off his nose, but he's not convinced

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.110
to give it over.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.910
-- Okay, so he takes it off his nose.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.433
Is he armed?

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.850
-- He has arms, but there are no weapons visible.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:19.683
-- Okay.

00:42:20.637 --> 00:42:23.554
(fingers drumming)

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.810
I continue to talk with him, and I'll tell you

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.090
what I'm gonna say in a moment, but first,

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.899
how do I communicate with Eric?

00:42:32.899 --> 00:42:36.170
Can I communicate telepathically, can I communicate--

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.003
do I have to use words?

00:42:37.003 --> 00:42:38.610
-- You can do a side whisper.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.180
-- I say, search the room, see what else is in here.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.893
Okay, so he goes around the room when I say:

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:49.190
well, to know how to open the power of the orb,

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.926
I need to touch it first, so I can feel

00:42:51.926 --> 00:42:54.610
where the source of its power is.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:55.860
-- Make a Deception check.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.950
-- 15 plus six.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.593
21 baby.

00:43:01.677 --> 00:43:02.780
-- 21. (laughing)

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.015
-- Blackjack.

00:43:04.015 --> 00:43:07.500
-- He goes, "Ah yes, feelings, feelings,

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.464
"I keep hearing about these feelings.

00:43:09.464 --> 00:43:11.420
"Well then, feel this and tell me

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.570
"before I swipe your existence away."

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:17.860
-- So, I have the orb, is Eric back yet?

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.280
-- Eric is currently like (buzzes)

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.740
doing a little scan around the back side.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.500
-- Okay, so I search the orb.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.690
Is there anything I can see on the orb?

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.780
What can I see when I look at it?

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.340
-- As you look into it for a moment,

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.602
you concentrate and focus, and within the orb,

00:43:30.602 --> 00:43:34.390
your consciousness seems to pierce its shiny exterior,

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:37.480
and for a moment you can see thousands,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.140
tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.600
pouring their faith and their joy and their generosity

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.650
towards this one central relic, to give it the power

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:49.490
to help others who need it.

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:51.630
It should not be in the clutches of such a creature.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.130
-- Now I know that where humans keep their generosity

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:55.093
is in their heart.

00:43:56.275 --> 00:44:00.450
But how do I activate the orb, that's what I don't know.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:01.545
Do I--?

00:44:02.525 --> 00:44:04.265
I put it on my nose.

00:44:04.265 --> 00:44:05.460
-- You put it on your nose. (whooshes)

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.010
It locks its way onto the front of your face.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.403
You feel as if the surge that the sword gave you once

00:44:11.403 --> 00:44:13.690
is now doubled over as the generosity

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.700
pouring from these people now pours into you.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.280
Your chest suddenly expands three inches,

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.460
more manly than you've ever been, your hair blows back

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.600
in a beautiful metal video type visage,

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.620
you hear music emit from out of nowhere,

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.380
and your sword goes, "Yeah, that's right,

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.453
"I told you he's great, bring it, old dead guy!"

00:44:33.985 --> 00:44:35.330
(laughing)

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:37.750
-- So the sword is picking a fight before I have.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:38.750
-- It's hyping you up, man.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.610
-- Okay, all right.
(Matt laughing)

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:44.040
I do what the sword says and we attack Zathkira.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.940
-- Go ahead and roll initiative for me.

00:44:47.477 --> 00:44:48.414
-- Three.

00:44:48.414 --> 00:44:50.100
-- Okay.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.933
So.

00:44:50.933 --> 00:44:53.600
-- Three plus, do I have initiative--

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.060
oh, plus two, five, jeez.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.153
-- All right, Zathkira, seeing this, goes,

00:44:58.153 --> 00:44:59.470
"Ah, I should've known!"

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.500
And pulls back, and you watch the hands crackle with divine

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.057
and arcane energy on both sides, slams them together

00:45:05.057 --> 00:45:07.820
as a bolt of lightning fires from his hands

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.863
in your direction.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.870
You have resistance, you take half damage.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:13.667
I need you to go ahead and just roll a d20

00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:15.120
and add your Dexterity modifier

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.405
to see if you can try and dodge out of the way.

00:45:17.405 --> 00:45:19.210
-- Four plus two, six.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.190
-- That's a no, so you take--(laughs)

00:45:26.046 --> 00:45:26.879
23,

00:45:29.299 --> 00:45:31.790
29 points of lightning damage,

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.620
reduced to half because of your resistance,

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.730
so you only take 14 points of lightning damage.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:39.919
-- I have one hit point left.

00:45:39.919 --> 00:45:41.810
(laughing)
One hit point left.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.220
So on my--

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.450
-- It's your turn for you and Eric.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.290
My round--is Eric back, by the way?

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.560
Eric is now in the back like (buzzing)

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.250
and pointing towards what looks to be a torch

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:56.180
hanging above a large bed covered in rags and linens.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.053
-- I Cure Wounds.

00:45:58.053 --> 00:46:00.250
-- Yourself?
-- I cure myself, yes.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.530
-- Go for it.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:02.363
1d8, right?

00:46:02.363 --> 00:46:04.120
-- You can cast it at a second level if you wanted to

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.953
to roll 2d8.

00:46:04.953 --> 00:46:05.786
-- Let's do this thing.

00:46:05.786 --> 00:46:06.833
-- All right, roll 2d8.

00:46:07.877 --> 00:46:11.140
-- Oh, six and seven, not too shabby.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.610
-- So 13 plus your Charisma modifier, four,

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.560
so you heal 17 hit points.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.310
-- So I'm back up to 18.
-- You are.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:19.597
-- So that was my round.

00:46:19.597 --> 00:46:20.430
-- That's your round, Eric gets to go

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.010
if you want Eric to do something.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.613
-- Eric attacks him.

00:46:23.613 --> 00:46:26.670
-- All right, Eric (buzzes) flies in towards

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.200
this undead mage, go ahead and roll an attack.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.230
-- 17.

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:31.733
-- Ooh, plus three?

00:46:31.733 --> 00:46:33.570
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.610
-- Okay.

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.720
1d4 plus one.
-- 1d4 plus one, wow.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.794
-- Mm-hmm, this isn't one of those things

00:46:38.794 --> 00:46:39.790
where if he stings somebody he dies,

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.970
like some insects, is it?

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:42.803
-- It depends on if he's allergic.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:44.783
-- Two.

00:46:44.783 --> 00:46:46.480
-- All right, so three points of damage.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.920
I meant, did Eric die,

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.140
because sometimes the stinger tears off.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.870
-- Oh, no no, he's not a honeybee.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.110
(laughing)

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:52.943
-- Okay.

00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:55.410
-- So as Eric (whooshes, groans)

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:59.220
reaches back and like is now completely dumbfounded

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.500
by this bee attacking him, like, "This strange creature!"

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.610
It's now his turn.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:03.443
-- Yes?

00:47:03.443 --> 00:47:07.263
-- He's gonna go ahead and cast Inflict Wounds on Eric.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.323
That's a 21 to hit.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.780
-- He has one hit point.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:14.613
-- Yeah.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.107
-- As he reaches back--

00:47:18.547 --> 00:47:20.367
I rolled double tens.

00:47:21.947 --> 00:47:24.063
21 points of necrotic damage, you watch as

00:47:24.063 --> 00:47:26.580
Eric is pulling out of the creature's neck,

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.860
angry faced, looking towards you, tiny bee thumbs up,

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.940
like, "You did a good job!"
-- Yes.

00:47:31.498 --> 00:47:34.730
He's just splatted across the side of his neck.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:37.080
Pulls the hand off, and you see a flattened, destroyed Eric,

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.893
kinda (buzzing) to the ground.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:43.803
It's your turn.

00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:46.008
(growling)

00:47:46.008 --> 00:47:48.258
(laughing)

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.050
-- I run to the door that Eric pointed out for me.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.140
-- You got it.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.570
You go charging past.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.760
It takes you the entire movement to get over there,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.610
you still have an action, what would you like to do?

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.457
-- Oh really?
-- Yeah.

00:48:00.457 --> 00:48:02.350
So you're on the opposite side where you see

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.970
this bed and this cluster of rags,

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.610
and there's a small doorway.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.050
A bed and a cluster of rags.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.373
-- Yes.
-- And a small doorway.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.260
Invisibility.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.220
-- All right, you cast Invisibility on yourself. (whooshes)

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.530
You're now, as far as you know, unseen.

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:26.550
Now as the undead mage spins around--

00:48:27.451 --> 00:48:28.451
"Now where's his master?

00:48:29.352 --> 00:48:31.130
"Come on!" (whooshes)

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.690
Fires a bolt of lightning off in the far corner,

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.830
near where you were on the front part of the chamber.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:38.663
-- Yes?

00:48:38.663 --> 00:48:39.900
-- He is not aware of your presence.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.853
It's your turn.

00:48:40.853 --> 00:48:42.460
-- I search the bed and the rags.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.480
Does that end my invisibility, if I search?

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.910
-- No, searching you can do.
-- Okay, I'll search.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:48.010
-- All right, go ahead and roll a d20 and add your,

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.785
yeah, perception.

00:48:49.785 --> 00:48:51.160
-- 16 plus perception
-- Plus zero.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.640
-- What do I got here, nothing.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.880
-- Yeah, all right, so as you're rummaging through

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.440
the rags underneath, you find what looks to be

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.479
a tiny, looks like a glass tube that contains

00:49:01.479 --> 00:49:04.360
some sort of faint blue energy.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.947
It throbs with a heartbeat, kinda (thumping).

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.837
Hidden beneath the pillow.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.600
--Was there--for me to put the nose on,

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.363
was there a crease or anything in the orb, no?

00:49:21.363 --> 00:49:22.313
-- In the orb, no.

00:49:22.313 --> 00:49:24.482
It just (whooshes) affixed itself to you.

00:49:24.482 --> 00:49:26.730
This has like, it's really cold to the touch

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.170
and kind of pulses with this dull energy.

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.940
As it lifts up, you see the undead mage turn towards you.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.940
"Oh, don't touch that!"

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.220
-- I shatter it.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.780
-- Okay, roll an attack with your sword against it

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.360
to see if you can.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.720
It is a very, very hardy material.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.206
Go for it.

00:49:46.206 --> 00:49:48.855
-- That one just got paged surprise right there.

00:49:48.855 --> 00:49:50.310
We're about to win, 15.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.460
--15 plus--?

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.917
-- Plus what, strength?

00:49:52.917 --> 00:49:54.510
-- No, with your sword.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:58.140
--Where's my sword, oh, oh, plus six, come on.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:58.973
21.

00:49:58.973 --> 00:50:01.690
-- Go ahead and roll damage with the radiant blade.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.740
-- It's 1d--
-- 1d10, right there.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.360
-- 1d10.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.193
Plus five.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:08.503
Nine.

00:50:08.503 --> 00:50:09.510
-- Nine points of radiant damage.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.870
As you pull the blade back, you throw this small vial

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.840
into the sky and you hear from the blade,

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.048
"I told you you can do it!"

00:50:16.048 --> 00:50:19.020
You slam it, (whooshes) it shatters in the air.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.830
Having discovered this mage's phylactery,

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.320
you watch as the glass spatters into a thousand pieces,

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.870
the blue pulsing energy within dissipating

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.357
as the mage goes, "No!"

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:29.400
And the body just falls limp, lifeless,

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.100
clattering to the ground, the bones hitting the stone.

00:50:34.968 --> 00:50:36.030
So, as you hold--

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.863
-- That's how you do it.

00:50:36.863 --> 00:50:39.830
-- Having the red magical orb in your possession,

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.934
glancing upon it, the blade at your side,

00:50:42.934 --> 00:50:47.934
you think to yourself, the sacrifice that Eric had made,

00:50:48.675 --> 00:50:52.488
maybe that will enable this good artifact

00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:55.350
to bring joy and generosity to many more

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:57.313
across the Menagerie Coast.

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:03.563
-- For Eric.

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:06.523
-- For Eric.

00:51:06.523 --> 00:51:07.356
-- For Eric.

00:51:08.453 --> 00:51:09.286
(chuckles)

00:51:09.286 --> 00:51:10.119
-- Thank you very much.

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:11.290
-- Thank you.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:15.936
I am so back in.

00:51:15.936 --> 00:51:17.140
(laughing)

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.160
It only took one adventure, I am so back in.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.290
I hope we can do this again sometime.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.356
-- I hope so too.

00:51:22.356 --> 00:51:23.189
-- Thank you so much, buddy.

00:51:23.189 --> 00:51:24.440
-- Happy Red Nose Day, everybody.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.273
-- Happy Red Nose Day.

00:51:25.273 --> 00:51:26.106
-- Thank you Eric.

00:51:27.063 --> 00:51:28.293
That was so fun.

00:51:28.293 --> 00:51:29.552
(people cheering)

00:51:29.552 --> 00:51:30.730
-- That was so much fun.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:31.848
Absolute pleasure, seriously.

00:51:31.848 --> 00:51:32.891
(applauding)

00:51:32.891 --> 00:51:34.047
Honestly, I'm not joking, like I really,

00:51:34.047 --> 00:51:35.120
I know we had to keep moving, but I just wanted to,

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.560
like, absorb what it felt like again,

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.391
because I mean, really, from like age 13 to age 20,

00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:43.830
I spent countless hours doing this.

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.290
-- Oh yeah, man.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:46.123
-- Unbelievable.

00:51:46.123 --> 00:51:48.125
This is what got me into theater and got me into acting.

00:51:48.125 --> 00:51:51.557
My D&D was my gateway, and now it's become

00:51:51.557 --> 00:51:54.850
an unexpected career that has just blown up, so.

00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:56.600
-- Thank you so much, man.
That was a ton of fun.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.969
-- Absolute pleasure.

00:51:57.969 --> 00:52:01.384
-- For Eric and his sacrifice in fighting Zaktira?

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:02.217
-- Zethkira.

00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:03.370
-- Zethkira.

00:52:04.138 --> 00:52:06.539
Please donate to Red Nose Day,

00:52:06.539 --> 00:52:09.463
and release your own Orb of Generosity.

00:52:12.669 --> 00:52:14.689
