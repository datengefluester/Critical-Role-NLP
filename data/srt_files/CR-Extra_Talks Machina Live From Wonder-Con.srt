BRIAN: My people! Welcome to Talks Machina Live at
WonderCon! Give it up!

00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:36,978
(cheering)

00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:41,867
BRIAN: You guys are looking good. If you're
looking at my haircut and wondering if you

5
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:56,119
accidentally stumbled into the Imagine Dragons
panel, you did not. The beard is in New York. I am

6
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:07,861
your host for this afternoon, affordable Chris
Hardwick, the internet's Brian Wayne Foster. Thank

7
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:19,227
you for coming! If you guys have seen Talks
Machina, you know we like to open the show with a

8
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:25,829
single question. Does anyone know what it is? Are
we on the internet, Denise?

9
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,219
DENISE: No, guys. You know we're pre-taping this
for Tuesday, right?

10
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:36,298
BRIAN: I know, okay, we are not on the Internet.
We will be on Tuesday.

11
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,717
DENISE: Yeah, uh-huh. That's correct. Uh-huh.

12
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:40,816
BRIAN: I literally just said that, Denise.

13
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:42,519
DENISE: Uh-huh, yeah, correct.

14
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:50,589
BRIAN: Moving on. No. We're going to go over a few
things really fast while we wait for Sam to get

15
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:57,889
here. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. Thank
you guys for waiting so long out there in line,

16
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:04,198
and for coming to see us. Some of you as far away
as Finland. Where are my Finland dudes at?

17
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:05,649
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Here!

18
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:16,459
BRIAN: Yes! Woo! The tall guys in the front. This
panel will air 7:00 Tuesday night in our

19
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:22,335
normal timed slot on Geek &amp; Sundry's Twitch and
Alpha. 7:00 PM Pacific, if you guys want to watch

20
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:29,570
this. If you're watching it right now, it's
Tuesday. Hello. I have the night off! I'm at home

21
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:37,926
drinking in the dark! Did you guys get pins when
you came in? Everybody get pins? We made those

22
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:43,389
specially for you guys, so hope you like them. If
we see you out and about today, there's also

23
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,330
people giving out some pin that says something
about "Free Denise" or whatever. So those are

24
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,765
some special edition ones. My grandfather used to
tell me, "Brian, a lot of things in this world are

25
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:59,810
"free, and Denise is not one of them." We're going
to try our best today to keep things as general as

26
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:06,404
possible, but as always, there may be some
spoilers if you are not all the way caught up on

27
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:16,523
Critical Role, #sorry #blamebrian. And finally, we
like on Talks Machina for most of the questions to

28
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:22,550
come from you guys. So, halfway through the panel,
I'm going to let you know to line up at the mics

29
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,071
and we'll spend the second half of the panel, you
guys asking questions. Do me a huge favor, do

30
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:32,911
everyone else a huge favor, please just one
question. Don't think we're going to have time for

31
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:39,670
individual questions for each of the cast. There's
still a lot of them for now. Try to limit it to

32
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:49,260
one or two questions. One question for one or two
cast members, if you will. And now, without

33
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,918
further ado, I would like to introduce the cast of
Critical Role.

Liam O'Brien!

00:04:52,161 --> 00:05:02,041
Woo! Laura motherfucking Bailey!

41
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:24,129
And our fearless leader, give it up, Mr. 
Matthew Mercer! Give it up! My goodness.

42
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,962
MATT: That's a lot of people. Hi!

43
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:36,711
SAM: Brian, how's it feel? This is the most people
that have or ever will see your show!

44
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:45,372
BRIAN: I would have thought it'd be a quarter of
this. At least after the first week. Speaking of

45
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:51,662
all these beautiful people out here, let's start
by talking about the community. I'm not going to

46
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:58,069
ask many individual questions, so you guys fight
over who wants to answer what. Sam, make sure

47
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,361
everyone gets a turn, please.

48
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,751
SAM: I can sing.

49
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:10,026
BRIAN: Let's hear it. Give us some Britney.
Yeah, give us a little Britney.

50
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:15,085
SAM: Britney? (singing) You might've been hurt,
babe. (normal) I don't know, is that Britney?

51
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:20,782
BRIAN: That's perfect. No, that's good. I think
that's a great place to stop. So between the

52
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:25,742
different portals where Critical Role is
available, every week a pretty insane amount of

53
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:34,422
people watch the show, unlike mine. I'm joking. I
said that because Sam said that. You're watching,

54
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:40,302
Mom, and that's all that matters. What's been the
coolest or most surprising part about the

55
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:43,012
community surrounding this show for you guys?

56
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:51,715
MATT: I'll jump in here and say that an internet
space that can be a very volatile and opinionated

57
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:58,002
place for people who are passionate, I'm
perpetually and continually proud that this

58
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:02,734
community has been so open, so accepting, and so
supportive of each other that it's kind of allowed

59
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:08,338
Critical Role to become so much more than just a
show. The community itself has become really the

60
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:19,319
driving and most important and magical thing about
it to me. So that's you guys. We're talking about you!

61
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,392
LAURA: Oh, there I am. I've been most surprised by
all of the sexy-time art.

62
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:29,733
BRIAN: All of the sexy-time art.

63
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,871
LAURA: That's really not surprising.

64
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:39,512
SAM: If I may, I've been recently most impressed
and surprised by the babies that have been named

65
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:47,433
after Liam. Several new babies are out there in
the world named Liam. I'm just throwing it out

66
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,563
there, Sam's a nice name for a boy <i>or</i> a girl!

67
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:54,983
MATT: So is Travis. Boy or girl.

68
00:07:54,983 --> 00:08:03,323
LIAM: I like seeing the hundreds of pictures we've
seen of new games that you guys are playing. A lot

69
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:06,751
of people who watch the show have never played
D&amp;D, didn't know what it was when they started.

70
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:14,367
We've seen hundreds of photos of people around card 
tables and dining room tables. It's amazing to see this

71
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:19,749
game that we quietly loved on our own at home,
spreading the way it is. I mean, it's been around

72
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,273
for ages but I feel like it's really kind of
setting on fire.

73
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:29,934
BRIAN: Heck yeah. So yeah. Hmm.

74
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:32,163
SAM: The golf clap.

75
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,634
BRIAN: A lot of people were like, I agree with
what he said, but I'd like to be gentle about it.

76
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:45,794
So as we're approaching nearly a hundred episodes
of Critical Role, and let's see, almost probably

77
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:49,057
five years of playing some of these characters?

78
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:50,558
MATT: Yeah.

79
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:57,083
BRIAN: What are the joys and challenges of a game
versus a show, and how do you not lose one or the

80
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,913
other?

81
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,234
MATT: Oh man, that's a good question.

82
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,625
BRIAN: He's confused by the question immediately.

83
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:09,934
MATT: As far as, like, challenges of both ways,
when you have a show, especially when it's

84
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:15,284
something that you do privately that's put on
display, there's a difficulty of, one, waiting for

85
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:19,954
an audience to set it on fire and watch the thing
you love be burned to the ground. Thankfully that

86
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:21,434
didn't happen!

87
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:22,957
BRIAN: That's my job, Matt.

88
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:29,472
MATT: Not yet. But I think at least, between the
two, what makes shows like this and other tabletop

89
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:33,965
shows and kind of what internet media is pushing
for now is people that are open about their

90
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:39,536
passion and are creating it for themselves as well
as the audience, and not just as content to be

91
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:44,864
consumed. It's an invitation to be part of it, as
opposed to, "Hope you like this thing I made!" As

92
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,428
long as we maintain that, I think we're doing
okay.

93
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:54,636
TRAVIS: I think we had two solid years of playing,
so we knew what our game was, we knew who our

94
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:59,476
characters were. We knew how much we hate each
others' guts and how irreverent we are. We don't

95
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,293
give a shit what anybody thinks.

96
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:02,906
MARISHA: Definitely not friends.

97
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,023
TRAVIS: Right, that's true.

98
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,305
MARISHA: Not based on friends.

99
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:10,656
TRAVIS: Once we got used to the random-ass cameras
being in the room, we keep doing our thing. Live

100
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:13,468
shows are totally, that's another thing.

101
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,948
TALIESIN: That's a whole different thing.

102
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,008
TRAVIS: There's a lot of people out there.

103
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:25,462
MARISHA: I know. Yeah, I will say, doing the live
show when I got the "How do you want to do this?"

104
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:33,688
and the entire audience exploding at Gen Con?
Definitely one of the top three, maybe four

105
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:37,218
moments of my life. It's insane.

106
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:42,628
MATT: That is one of the weirdest things. Having
this little phrase that organically started in our

107
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:47,593
game rooms at home, not just on merch, but other
people in thousands of games use it now. I'm like,

108
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:51,091
it's exciting! I would never have thought that!

109
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,058
MARISHA: People have it tattooed on their bodies.

110
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:56,929
MATT: I know, I'm sorry! This was not expected!

111
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,928
LAURA: I have it tattooed across my lower back.

112
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,237
MATT: You, too?

113
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:02,989
TRAVIS: You do?!

114
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:11,138
LIAM: Sam in a random game at Laura and Travis'
dining room table, putting his finger here, is now

115
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,118
the stuff of legend.

116
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:18,160
SAM: Yeah. But we always did blame Keyleth, even
at the home game.

117
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,469
MATT: Thanks, Keyleth.

118
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,559
SAM: We kept that consistent.

119
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:33,228
BRIAN: Before this goes completely off the rails
in about four minutes, hey, my dad's here, guys. A

120
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:41,528
lot of people recently have been talking about the
connection between tabletop RPGs and social

121
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:48,149
therapy. Has the show been therapeutic for you
guys in any way, and if so, you know, in what ways?

122
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,818
TRAVIS: I mean, we drink a lot.

123
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:56,838
LIAM: You're going to put it right out there,
huh?

124
00:11:56,838 --> 00:12:02,040
TRAVIS: Water. We drink water a lot.

125
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,819
BRIAN: They're too far away to see all the liver
stains on your face from all of the Goldschläger.

126
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:12,655
TALIESIN: I'll say the game is therapeutic. I
don't necessarily know if broadcasting it on the

127
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:16,379
internet is therapeutic. But the game is! I work
things out.

128
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,791
MARISHA: Yeah, we work things out from the
response on the internet from the week before on

129
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,269
the game. It's like an ouroboros.

130
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,924
TALIESIN: It was a few weeks ago, I was with you,
and I was like, man, I'm in a mood. Percy's going

131
00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:35,461
to do something messed up, man. Argh. I need to put
it somewhere. I'm going to kill a guy. Somebody

132
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:39,721
yelled at my mom three states away, grr. True
story.

133
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:42,159
MARISHA: That is true, yeah.

134
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:48,080
LAURA: I think, more than anything, it's the
getting to hang out with our family every single

135
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,320
week, you know? Because getting to hang out with
you guys always puts me in such a good mood, any

136
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,978
time I'm depressed or anything like that, the
minute we all get together it's so uplifting.

137
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:03,501
Yeah. Wah-wah, cheesy, whatever. But it's true.

138
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:09,530
TALIESIN: It's true though, because we've all done
theater. There's that family thing that happens in

139
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,546
theater, but then there's that pre-show jitter
that happens with theater. I don't get the

140
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,667
pre-show jitter, I just get the family vibe. It's
really nice.

141
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,716
LAURA: I fully get a pre-show jitter. Every time
I'm on my way to the show, I'm like, I feel like

142
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,050
I'm about to do a play that I know none of the
lines to.

143
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,800
BRIAN: That's why you do a bunch of shots first.

144
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,601
MATT: Don't even talk about pre-show jitters to
me, guys. I'm a madman for an hour before every

145
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:35,032
cast. You guys see me, I don't even talk to them.
They come by like, hey Matt! I'm like, go away,

146
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:36,928
I'm setting things up.

147
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:41,581
LAURA: And then when Sam wasn't there, just
recently, we reminded you right before the show,

148
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:45,604
we were like, oh yeah! Sam's not here this week!
You were like, oh, that's right! And you had to

149
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:48,190
completely play Tary out of the blue.

150
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,301
MATT: I was like, okay, cool, that's happening!
Give me more of that <i>water</i>, Travis!

151
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:57,161
TRAVIS: Yeah, we have rituals for that. All the
profanities that we throw to you right before we

152
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,960
go live? It's our way of going, welcome, Matt!

153
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,651
MATT: Yeah, that's a great little dodge and weave
every week now.

154
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,301
LIAM: Born out of love.

155
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:13,122
MARISHA: Some people walk out to the ring with
hardcore metal music. We shout profanities at our

156
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,804
DM. That's what we do to hype ourselves up.

157
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:24,031
MATT: I don't recommend it unless-- be really good
friends with your DM before you do that, please.

158
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,972
That's when the boulder appears and crushes your
character, so be careful.

159
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:33,553
MARISHA: On this entire question about therapy,
we've only talked about things that people go to

160
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,391
therapy about.

161
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:39,783
MATT: But that's also part of therapy! But no, to
try and tie it back to the question--

162
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:41,232
BRIAN: <i>Please</i>.

163
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:43,192
TRAVIS: No, leave the question alone. It's done.

164
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:47,461
MATT: Well no, I mean, tabletop gaming, there's
been a lot of studies that speak on the

165
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:52,046
therapeutic benefits of the ability to create a
persona that is outside of yourself, live in those

166
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:58,028
shoes, and build empathy through that experience.
I know I owe a lot of who I am today to playing

167
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:03,930
tabletop gaming. Not only this experience forged
our friendships to be as strong as they are, but

168
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,440
it's now gone out and forged all these
friendships through this community and beyond. You

169
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,110
know, there are people I used to game with that I
still keep in contact to this day from a long time

170
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,131
ago. So it's a weird shared bond, like, going
through a very intense experience together with

171
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:23,797
people, except it's all up here because we're
crazy. In my eyebrows. Everyone has to go into my

172
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,681
eyebrows for the adventure.

173
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:29,279
BRIAN: He stores all the next campaign in those
eyebrows.

174
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,165
MATT: That's what Wildemount is translated to in
Dwarvish.

175
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:39,652
LIAM: I'll also say, I have one last thing to add.
Before this show was a show, when it was just a

176
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:43,779
game, oh boy.

177
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,972
MATT: Let it happen.

178
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:50,676
LIAM: I, in a very real way, hit rock bottom when
this was just our game at home. Then I did it

179
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:59,520
again during this show. The people you're seeing
up here are the closest, outside of my own family,

180
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,059
are my family. We're not faking it. We weren't
cast. These are the closest people in my life.

181
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:11,855
They helped me work through some shit on stage.
It's one of the greatest gifts in my life.

182
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:13,697
BRIAN: Hell yeah.

183
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:17,783
(cheering)

184
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:20,522
LAURA: That got more than golf claps, Liam!
Congratulations!

185
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:26,715
SAM: He's sensitive.

186
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:36,792
BRIAN: Even at WonderCon, something for Tumblr.
Okay. That is all for Tumblr. Hey, where do you

187
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:45,923
guys feel Vox Machina stands in their
ever-evolving ability to plan and seek varying

188
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,341
options? How do you think it's going?

189
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,943
LIAM: We are role models!

190
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:54,725
LAURA: We're the worst. Just the worst at
planning.

191
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,875
TRAVIS: Man, we're Seal Team Six, shut up!

192
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:01,019
LAURA: Honestly, that's one of the hardest things
about knowing that it's being broadcast, because

193
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,281
if we were at home and we were going through this
planning stage, it'd be, okay, well, we're taking

194
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:09,229
our time planning, no big deal. Let's go get some
snacks while we're doing it.

195
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,837
LIAM: Who wants another mimosa?

196
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:15,662
LAURA: Exactly, we'd be drinking mimosas,
whatever. But on the show, I know that people are

197
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:18,787
probably like, oh my god, just do something
already!

198
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,356
MATT: By "people", you mean Travis?

199
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:25,603
LAURA: Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, I do have that
smoke rising next to me. I can feel it.

200
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:32,622
MATT: I will say, you guys have gotten better
recently. I mean, moderately. Incrementally. There

201
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:37,171
has been more planning. There has been more seeing
alternate options before making a choice. This

202
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:42,404
happened in a recent episode. So you guys are
stepping, baby steps, in a good direction! Travis

203
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:44,267
is already out, all right. Next question.

204
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:49,838
TALIESIN: No, but there's a fair point, also, to
say, and I feel like this is true even of my home

205
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:55,855
games that we played before stream, I think of--
and I know I'm going to get a list of movie

206
00:17:55,855 --> 00:18:01,387
titles. You think of your favorite movies and so
many of them are about making a plan and executing

207
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:07,861
it perfectly, and then everything going fine, and
like, that's not fun. Chaos is fun! Complete lack

208
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,558
of control is fun!

209
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:11,631
TRAVIS: You sounded like the Joker just then. That
was amazing.

210
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:18,861
LIAM: We all can't wait till Travis has to play a
19-intelligence general or wizard next campaign.

211
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:25,986
MARISHA: Yeah, if you're not some type of war
general planning Sun Tzu type of shit next

212
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,033
campaign--

213
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,627
LAURA: It'll be great. Then we'll all know what to
do.

214
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:37,066
TRAVIS: I plan to play a pigeon next. I'm going
down. I'm not going up. Intelligence of six? I'm

215
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,901
coming to three.

216
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:43,234
LAURA: He does nothing but drool the whole game.

217
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:50,305
BRIAN: To go with Matt's point about being
moderately better at it, the reason the panel

218
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:54,489
started late is we were in the back and then the
security guy said, "The panel's right through that

219
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:58,189
"door." And everybody stopped and went--

220
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:00,458
TRAVIS: Our old nemesis.

221
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:10,336
BRIAN: We've seen one of these before! Matt, tell
us a little bit, mild, teeny baby mild-sauce

222
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:15,327
spoilers. Tell us a little bit about devil
contracts and the dangers of the Hells, where Vox

223
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,436
Machina currently find themselves.

224
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:21,696
MATT: Well, for those who aren't familiar with the
difference between devils and demons, in a

225
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:28,062
nutshell, demons are an ancient chaotic force of
destruction and mayhem. Devils are very organized,

226
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:34,526
tyrannical structure of chaos and mayhem. Recent
adventures bring them to a very dangerous place,

227
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:41,239
with a lot of large-scale dangers than they're
used to. They're used to single-target, localized

228
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:46,511
enemies. They've stepped into a territory where
everything around you for forever is bad. It's

229
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:56,353
been fun to watch them squirm, I'm not going to
lie. As far as contracts go, that's the bread and

230
00:19:56,353 --> 00:20:03,470
butter of the devils' work. That's how they gain
their influence and power. I was very eager to see

231
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:09,821
what the reaction was when such a contract was
presented. So, without spoiling anything, I am

232
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:17,737
very proud of my group. From a DM standpoint, not
for you guys. I absolutely love anything you do

233
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:26,414
that is a poor choice. It fills me with such joy
and inspiration. But to be fair, in the Nine

234
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:31,650
Hells, there is no real great choice. Everything
is going to probably end up poorly. So, good

235
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,741
luck!

236
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:39,513
BRIAN: Somebody's asking for some Lord Have Mercer
in the near future.

237
00:20:39,513 --> 00:20:43,960
LAURA: I have a question though. If you were good
in the Nine Hells, if you did something nice,

238
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,978
that's actually the equivalent of doing something
bad?

239
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:51,841
MATT: I mean, it's not that black and white. If
you did something good, people would be like,

240
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:58,043
why'd you do that? Depending on who it was. We'll
find out, huh?

241
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,114
TRAVIS: We don't plan on doing anything good.

242
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:02,925
MATT: I didn't think so.

243
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:05,221
BRIAN: Or anything well.

244
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:15,083
MARISHA: Is it kind of like a Vegas situation,
like, what happens in the Nine Hells stays in the

245
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:20,785
Nine Hells? If so, Spring Break '94! Cancun!

246
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:23,503
TRAVIS: Are there brothels in Hell?

247
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:28,521
LAURA: "Are there brothels in hell." Are there
brothels in Hell?

248
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:35,813
MATT: You know what incubi and succubi are, guys?
Grog'll maybe find out! Tune in next week!

249
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:37,470
BRIAN: Don't taunt the DM.

250
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,714
LAURA: You have to sign a contract in order to
walk into the brothel.

251
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:43,498
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

252
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:51,430
BRIAN: Guys, in an orderly fashion, please line up
for questions if you have them. We will get to

253
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,745
them shortly.

254
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,218
MATT: Where do they line up?

255
00:21:55,218 --> 00:22:01,555
BRIAN: There's a mic in the center here, I see. I
am blinded (singing) blinded by the light!

256
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:16,299
(normal) Oh, there's a spotlight right there in
the center! Okay, up next, Sam. How much fun are

257
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:20,045
you having with everything going on right now?
Because it looks like the answer is a lot.

258
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:28,626
SAM: With my current state of characterization? I
don't want to spoil. Am I not supposed to spoil

259
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:29,831
things?

260
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:32,769
BRIAN: I don't know, what do you guys think? is
everyone caught up?

261
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,968
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes!

262
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:36,770
BRIAN: Hit them with it, Sam!

263
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:44,281
SAM: Yeah man, so I get to play, unlike everyone
else on stage, a new character right now. It's so

264
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:50,290
exciting and it's so fun. It was terrifying for
the first two or three times, as it will be for

265
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:57,379
you all when you all die. But because, like these
guys said, we've been doing these characters for

266
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:05,805
so long, we know them backwards and forwards, but
to play a new guy is super weird. It feels like--

267
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:13,316
Well, I was going to say something really dirty
and I'm not going to. There's a little placard

268
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:17,218
right here that says, "Please be aware that
members of your audience are underage."

269
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:21,663
BRIAN: I said the F-word in the intro.

270
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:32,405
SAM: Anyway, I feel ham-handed and weird and
awesome. What am I doing? I don't know! I don't

271
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:37,010
know what I'm doing, oh god! Oh god, it's
happening, no! Stop it! No, it's very

272
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,348
exhilarating, Brian, and I'm having a lot of fun
with it. I don't know how long it'll last, but I'm

273
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:44,885
riding it.

274
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:49,716
TALIESIN: You've definitely inspired a lot of
vaguely drunk conversations about what we're going

275
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:52,727
to do next, between a bunch of us. We've started
talking.

276
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:58,920
LIAM: Lot of ideas. When you made your entrance
and saw all of our faces, did you feel like you

277
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:02,620
had walked into a seedy tavern on the wrong side
of town? Like, some guy breaking a bottle and

278
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,980
sizing you up?

279
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:14,062
SAM: You guys all had such scorn! Such hatred on
your faces! I was genuinely scared you would fire

280
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:20,532
me or something. I don't know. No, it was great.
It made me work harder to try to convince you to

281
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:23,488
let me stick around, and you did. For now.

282
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:26,303
LAURA: And then everything you did, I was like, I
don't believe it.

283
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:33,415
MARISHA: Laura and I were genuinely pissed at you
for a good 24 hours. Not cool.

284
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:36,072
SAM: Sorry. I trolled you guys.

285
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:37,877
MARISHA: You totally did.

286
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:45,796
BRIAN: Doesn't that character seem like the kind
of guy who would have a Chumbawamba tattoo?

287
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:50,705
SAM: For sure, for sure. He was into them long
before Tubthumping, though.

288
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,999
BRIAN: Yeah, that's true.

289
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:57,448
TALIESIN: Britney you don't know, but that, you
know. Okay. Glad that's making a map right there.

290
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,478
BRIAN: So, this question's from me.

291
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:01,348
SAM: It's for you?

292
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:09,319
BRIAN: No, from me, man! Watch my lips when I
speak! Read my lips! Noelle Stevenson was on the

293
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:17,289
show this week. Special guest star, and will be
back this week! Now, in almost 100 episodes of

294
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:24,036
Critical Role, there have been many, many guest
stars. Would you guys say this is the first

295
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:25,303
Noelle?

296
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:27,642
(groaning)

297
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,511
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Boo this man!

298
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:35,409
BRIAN: I'm not apologizing. I'm not taking it
back. Throw your fruit, America. Laura's face is

299
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:43,421
the reason that joke made the cut. I want to hear
everyone's favorite one-liners from the past 92

300
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:44,923
episodes.

301
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,363
LAURA: Our favorite what?

302
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:50,611
BRIAN: Like, pick out your favorite one-liner.
Rapid-fire them at me.

303
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:56,439
TALIESIN: People legitimately tweet quotes at me,
and my only reaction is, I said that? When did I

304
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,908
say that?

305
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:03,192
MARISHA: Sometimes Matt will read one back and
I'll be like, that's funny! Who said that? And

306
00:26:03,192 --> 00:26:05,605
he'll be like, you did. And I'm like, oh.

307
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,509
TALIESIN: I don't even know the context anymore!

308
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:08,971
MARISHA: Yeah, what was I talking about?

309
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:12,235
TRAVIS: "Your secret is safe with my indifference"
is one.

310
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:13,882
TALIESIN: Thank you, I'm very proud of that one.

311
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:16,214
MARISHA: "Trust me, I have an intelligence of six.
I know what I'm doing."

312
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:23,968
TALIESIN: I'm going to be a jerk. I can only think
of one of my own. "Life needs things to live." I'm

313
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:30,281
so glad that has weirdly-- I was so tired. I'm so
pleased, thank you Sam, that has become a thing. I

314
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,045
can never escape it ever again.

315
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:33,481
SAM: It's profound.

316
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:36,150
TALIESIN: Oh, I was so tired.

317
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,724
LAURA: Oh man. I liked-- oh, I can't say it,
because under 18. "In the darkness, I say,

318
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:49,706
"'fuck.'" I liked that one.

319
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:55,559
MATT: I mean technically, it was written, but it
had a lot of impact, I think. By a good writer.

320
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,518
When Patrick Rothfuss wrote the letter to Keyleth,
the "You passed through fire," I think, was such a

321
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,822
wonderful encapsulation of her character arc at
that time.

322
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,257
LIAM: That guy can write!

323
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:11,595
MATT: Yeah! He should do a book! At least, a third
one. Sorry, Pat!

324
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:16,336
BRIAN: There was one episode, maybe 20 episodes
ago, where Matt was describing something and he's

325
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:23,783
like, "There's this giant cylinder. It's almost
wheel-shaped." And Sam goes, "Wheel?" That's like,

326
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:30,884
yes, a wheel-shaped wheel. Why wouldn't I have
just said, "a wheel"? Okay, last question from me,

327
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:36,474
and then we'll go to the audience. What's
something about your characters you think will

328
00:27:36,508 --> 00:27:47,171
never change, despite what Vox Machina ends up
going through? Oh god, this guy.

329
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:48,386
TRAVIS: Ale.

330
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:50,322
BRIAN: Yeah, good answer.

331
00:27:50,322 --> 00:28:01,736
MARISHA: I mean, she's always going to put her
foot in her mouth at least once a week.

332
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:04,720
TRAVIS: Get arrested once a year.

333
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:13,011
MARISHA: Yeah. Hopefully, I don't think I ever
want Keyleth to lose her wonderlust, her

334
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:19,154
excitement for the world and her love for the
world.

335
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:26,094
TALIESIN: I think the air of superiority may go.
It may not. But the anger issues, I don't think

336
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:30,833
are ever going away. He'll never stop pretending
he doesn't have them.

337
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,106
LIAM: Is that in character?

338
00:28:33,106 --> 00:28:38,437
TALIESIN: (Percy voice) No, yes, of course.

339
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:41,941
SAM: Poop and/or puke.

340
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:50,507
LIAM: Vax will probably always step in front of
trains if he thinks it will keep the family safe.

341
00:28:50,507 --> 00:29:06,823
LAURA: Aww. Urgh. Vex will probably always hold
grudges. She'll always want to get naked in random

342
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:10,727
situations. And she'll always love Trinket.

343
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:16,600
SAM: And Victor will have less and less digits.

344
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,337
MATT: I will always have multiple personality
disorder. There we go, thank you.

345
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:28,138
BRIAN: Who is up first at the mic with the
spotlight on it?

346
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:29,618
LAURA: In the Pikelight!

347
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:30,818
BRIAN: Hello!

348
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,921
SAM: Hey, Loot Crate shirt!

349
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:39,893
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, my question is for Marisha,
Taliesin, and Sam. Simple, what would you

350
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:44,344
multiclass your character into if you had whatever
option?

351
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:46,198
TALIESIN: Oh, current character?

352
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:47,766
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, current character.

353
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:51,839
BRIAN: No, the one I'm writing for you for the
next campaign. I'm writing all your new

354
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,105
characters.

355
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,308
MARISHA: Barbarian.

356
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:55,919
TALIESIN: Whoa.

357
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,637
MARISHA: Yeah. But I'm going for that Archdruid,
bitches. I want that level 20!

358
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:09,342
TALIESIN: God, probably sorcerer at this point.
Which I know would be a little weird, but I'd make

359
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:13,461
it work. I'm not going to multiclass, but if he
did, that's where it would end up.

360
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:20,636
SAM: I mean, I just asked Matt what multiclassing
is, so. I don't really know how to play Dungeons

361
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:25,478
and Dragons. I don't know, wizard? Is that a
thing? Is wizard a thing? Okay, great.

362
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:29,146
MATT: Wizard is actually artificer-adjacent, so
yeah!

363
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:30,883
SAM: Okay, good.

364
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,986
LIAM: Yeah, you never play. You've only played 500
hours.

365
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:35,150
SAM: As one guy! Well, two.

366
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:41,461
MATT: You're a busy man, making Duck Tales and
shit. It's fine.

367
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:45,933
BRIAN: Thank you. Hey, what's your name?

368
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:54,345
JARED: Hi, I'm Jared. Hi. This question is
actually for Matt. You are awesome, and I aspire

369
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:55,793
to be a DM like you someday.

370
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:58,713
MATT: You are awesome, and I aspire to be you.

371
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:04,540
JARED: Thank you! So, I have watched your whole
series on tips for dungeons masters. I was

372
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:10,076
wondering if there was anything else that you had
to tell any dungeon masters who are up and coming?

373
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:15,622
Also, if maybe you're going to be on the floor to
sign my Dungeon Master's Guide and bless it so

374
00:31:15,622 --> 00:31:17,485
that my campaign goes well?

375
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:21,388
BRIAN: Does that work, Matt? Do you hear from
people that, if you've blessed a Player's

376
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:24,090
Handbook, that they rule?

377
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,693
MATT: Yeah, dice and books before, and you know
what? I feel guilty if they don't work, and if

378
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:38,171
they work, I'm happy to take credit. But thank
you. As far as advice goes, my first point of

379
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:44,183
advice would be watch Matt Colville's YouTube
channel. There's a lot I would like to say, but I

380
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:49,383
don't have the time to get into the nitty-gritty,
and he has such an incredible way of communicating

381
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:54,826
very elaborate, detailed, and informative
conversations and discussions on this topic. If

382
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:59,130
you haven't seen his work, check out his videos.
They're incredible. He's a dear friend and an

383
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:06,140
amazing writer, so check it out. As far as
blessing your book, I can bless it from here, and

384
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:12,980
if you can hunt me down at some point today, we
couldn't get a spot to do a signing at this

385
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:20,354
convention, unfortunately. WonderCon was a little
slammed. But I will send my juju from here.

386
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:22,753
SAM: I'll grab a piece of his hair for you later.

387
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:32,463
BRIAN: Yeah, we can get that cleared with the con
staff. Who's up next? Step into the light! What's

388
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:33,734
up?

389
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:34,971
MARCUS: Hello!

390
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:37,106
TALIESIN: White Phoenix shirt, very solid. Feeling
it.

391
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:45,599
MARCUS: I'm Marcus, and my question is to Matt.
I've noticed a lot of 18s and 19s failing recently

392
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,053
while in, where they are. I'm trying to keep
spoilers out. Is that due to levels scaling, or is

393
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:50,419
it due to where they are?

394
00:32:50,419 --> 00:33:01,332
MATT: It's due to the scaling of the entities that
they're working with, and the situation involved.

395
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:07,170
A DC can be set based on how difficult the
challenge is. You know, if a person's like, I'm

396
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:12,304
trying to stealth in a shadowy alleyway, that's
going to be a pretty low DC, but if I'm going to

397
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,343
try and stealth while standing on top of this
lighthouse in broad daylight, it'll probably have

398
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,582
a higher DC to roll a proper stealth check.

399
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,385
LIAM: I can do it.

400
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:28,224
MATT: He could probably pull it off. So yeah, I
adjust the DC. If a person's trying to convince

401
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:32,656
somebody and they make a really convincing
argument, I'll lower the DC for a persuasion roll.

402
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:39,201
If they really bungle it up, then I'll raise it a
little higher. So yeah, it'll adjust depending. A

403
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:45,442
lot of creatures that work in the place where they
currently are, you know, the Hells, they thrive on

404
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:50,814
deception and being paranoid. Especially in Dis.
Dispater, the archdevil of where they are right

405
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:55,485
now, is a very paranoid son of a bitch. That
nature of always looking to see if your underlings

406
00:33:55,485 --> 00:34:00,425
are trying to undermine you means that if you're
trying to lie, they're going to definitely have a

407
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:04,996
high sense for that and be looking for that as
well. So yeah. To answer your question, yes. Thank

408
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:07,966
you.

409
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:14,240
BRIAN: Who's up next? I don't know why I said that
so creepy.

410
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,595
EDDIE: You've seen me before. I was at Gen Con. I
have a question for you guys. Oh, Eddie Freeman,

411
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:29,016
by the way. Freeman. Free man. Eddie Freeman. My
question for you is, you guys just entered Hell.

412
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:36,684
As your characters, what were your first
impressions and your second impressions? Of Hell?

413
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:44,322
TRAVIS: Everything's hot and it burns.

414
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:48,157
MARISHA: Kind of reminds us of the City of Brass.

415
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,529
TALIESIN: This is fine.

416
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:53,303
TRAVIS: The food is not that bad.

417
00:34:53,303 --> 00:35:03,442
MATT: I'm going to call this to the art community.
Can somebody please do an art piece of Vox Machina

418
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:10,963
sitting in the City of Dis, saying communally,
"This is fine." Please? Sam.

419
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:20,463
SAM: My guy's been so petrified, terrified, for
the last, all of their travels together that this

420
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:26,135
is nothing new. I mean, he's at a baseline of
abject terror all the time.

421
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:35,546
LIAM: Temporarily thinking, one last job. Just one
last job, until it all fucks up again. Oops,

422
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:36,682
sorry.

423
00:35:36,682 --> 00:35:39,384
SAM: Children! It's a Dungeons and Dragons term.

424
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:46,158
LAURA: I think Vex quickly realized that her
normal tricks aren't working down there, and now

425
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:49,939
she's at a loss. I don't know what the eff I'm
supposed to say. I don't know, because none of her

426
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,087
persuasion was working. It sucks!

427
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,304
MATT: Roll higher.

428
00:35:55,304 --> 00:36:02,619
LAURA: Oh, it's the dice. It's totally just the
dice, it's not my bumbling over words.

429
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,238
MATT: No, not at all.

430
00:36:04,238 --> 00:36:09,316
BRIAN: Okay, it's not the dice, because if two
thousand people believe one thing and one guy

431
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:16,112
believes another, and he goes, all of you were
wrong, I think it might be-- It's probably the

432
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:22,299
dice. Who's up next? Thank you, Eddie Freeman.
Good to see you, man. I love that thing.

433
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:26,630
LAURA: We still have it, yeah! We have, at our
house, you gave one to Travis before, right?

434
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,371
BRIAN: Oh, that's cool. Who's up next?

435
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:35,146
BRENDAN: Hey guys, my name is Brendan. I'm
flexing, because Travis, you're yoked as hell.

436
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:38,417
LAURA: Oh, you're wearing your Strongjaw shirt!

437
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:49,397
BRENDAN: So, thanks for the flex. Travis, this is
for you. You're not ashamed of being a fan of

438
00:36:49,397 --> 00:37:02,550
Hamilton. Recently, Lin Manuel tweeted that he
played his first game of D&amp;D. Sorry. Who would you

439
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,726
rather have a song of inspiration from, Scanlan or
Lin Manuel?

440
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:15,409
TRAVIS: Ooh. I would require a rap battle between
one Scanlan Shorthalt and one Lin Manuel Miranda.

441
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:22,848
To drop some lyrical rhymes! The winner could be
my inspiration maker.

442
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:30,159
MATT: I will say, now that Lin Manuel has gotten
himself a little warmed up, I think it's time for

443
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,422
him to take another crack at a different D&amp;D
game.

444
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:35,892
LAURA: That would be amazing.

445
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:38,466
MATT: No, seriously, Lin, please come play with
us!

446
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:48,542
BRIAN: Get on it, Denise! Who's up next? Hey!

447
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:56,451
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. So, Laura, you
specifically, this last episode, came in with a

448
00:37:56,451 --> 00:38:05,260
slightly different accent. So, not to call you on
it, but how do you guys in total keep your voices

449
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,133
in check? How do you keep your voices in your head
in check?

450
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:14,002
LAURA: Normally it's not that hard! I came off of
an eight-hour session of recording as a South

451
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:17,902
African, so it was in my brain, is all.

452
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:24,116
SAM: I don't know how Matt does it. I mean, he
changes accents within sentences, sometimes.

453
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:32,887
MATT: I had a lot of time alone as a kid. I make
notes. I have general notes next to certain NPCs

454
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:39,466
of their vocal texture, their age, different
things to get me Cliffs Notes. I try and ballpark

455
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:41,803
it whenever they show up, or I make something up.

456
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:49,294
SAM: So is it like, age and a descriptor, or is it
like, this one sounds like Lucky the Leprechaun?

457
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:53,680
MATT: I mean, if there is a celebrity I can
attribute it to, I'll put that down. Like an Alan

458
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,729
Rickman type, or an Orson Welles type. Usually
it's like, you know, gravelly, low, basically what

459
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:04,558
you'd see in any voice-over side, where it's super
vague but just enough to get an idea.

460
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:09,454
LIAM: Oh, it must be a weird setlist, like,
Godfried, Chocolate Rain.

461
00:39:09,454 --> 00:39:16,055
MATT: Kind of, yeah. Like most of my notes, it's
all Sanskrit at this point. It's only for me to

462
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:17,543
read.

463
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:20,017
BRIAN: Who is up next?

464
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:24,883
JARED #2: Hi.

465
00:39:24,883 --> 00:39:26,523
BRIAN: What's your name?

466
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:32,691
JARED #2: My name is Jared as well. Hi. This is a
question for Matt. What's been one of your

467
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:37,329
favorite experiences as a DM in the past couple of
years, doing Critical Role?

468
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:44,741
MATT: Oh man. I mean, some of my favorite
experiences as a DM involve having an opportunity

469
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:50,579
to share what little knowledge I have with people,
and learn things from other DMs. You know, as a

470
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:56,252
community, D&amp;D for a long time was whatever you
could learn from your local comic shop, and maybe

471
00:39:56,252 --> 00:40:01,492
a forum board in the mid-2000s when that became
more of a thing. So now there's this breadth of

472
00:40:01,492 --> 00:40:06,470
information out there, from all these different
schools of running a game. For me, it's been

473
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,467
really cool to learn from other people and try and
impart what I do know, that's hopefully helpful to

474
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:15,040
other people. That's been a big thing. As far as
actually playing a game with these guys, I'd say

475
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,775
probably the attack on Emon. Having a
two-and-a-half-year-long plot hook that's been

476
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:28,650
brewing and brewing, and get them into this place
of comfort and finality, and then smash it all to

477
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,629
pieces and watch their faces as everything they
know crumples around them. That was pretty fun.

478
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:41,330
BRIAN: Who's next? Step on up to the mic!

479
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,071
MARISHA: Each person that walks up, it's like a
reveal. Step into the spotlight!

480
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,607
BRIAN: Hi! Hey, what's your name?

481
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:54,615
ANTHONY: Anthony Lopez. So, my question is not
really specific to anyone, but who would your

482
00:40:54,615 --> 00:40:57,513
greatest dream celebrity guest be?

483
00:40:57,513 --> 00:40:59,017
MARISHA: Stephen Colbert.

484
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:02,561
LAURA: Oh my god, yes.

485
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,722
BRIAN: Scanlan Shorthalt.

486
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:12,369
SAM: He's a fun guy.

487
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,973
MATT: What about you guys? Anyone else?

488
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,776
TALIESIN: I feel like we've talked about this
before, and now I'm drawing a blank, other than

489
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:20,985
Lin Manuel.

490
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:29,183
SAM: It would be nice to have, like, the entire
cast of Cats. I don't know. Like, in costume. I

491
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:31,628
don't know. Might be fun.

492
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:35,826
MATT: As one cumulative guest? They switch out
roleplaying the character?

493
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:40,292
BRIAN: And then Sam could come in dressed as Hotis
from the Halloween episode and totally steal the

494
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,066
show, obviously!

495
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:49,310
MARISHA: We have tossed into the universe that we
would love to try and play with the Stranger

496
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,611
Things kids.

497
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:57,953
MATT: And since we already got Vin Diesel, the
next step obviously is Madame Judi Dench. I think

498
00:41:57,953 --> 00:42:03,432
she'd have fun. Since he did teach her how to
play! Yeah.

499
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:09,832
BRIAN: Yeah, I've often heard, if you can get
Diesel, you can get Dame Judi. Who's up next?

500
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:10,762
Thank you.

501
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:11,966
TRAVIS: They package them together a lot.

502
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:14,571
SAM: One of our guests is here, by the way. Jason
Miller.

503
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:19,040
BRIAN: Jason Charles Miller, raise your hand! Also
did the theme song for Critical Role and Talks

504
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,477
Machina, ladies and gentlemen! Royalty.

505
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:26,282
LAURA: You know, he's the one that wrote our
opening theme song, right?

506
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:31,286
SAM: Also, Dame Judi Dench is right over there!

507
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:32,479
MATT: Hello!

508
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:37,455
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! I mainly had a question about
when you converted from your pre-show game to your

509
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:41,524
live. Did anything change because you converted
from Pathfinder to 5th edition, character- or

510
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:42,793
story-wise?

511
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:48,363
MATT: Story-wise, no. I mean, some of the
character abilities changed based on the system,

512
00:42:48,363 --> 00:42:50,503
but not a whole lot, thankfully.

513
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:56,209
SAM: Some of the mechanics of how it works change.
We had to re-learn. We did a couple of practice

514
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:57,754
sessions with Matt.

515
00:42:57,754 --> 00:43:00,580
MATT: I'll tell you, Scanlan became a lot more
helpful.

516
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,924
SAM: Yeah, for sure.

517
00:43:01,924 --> 00:43:07,791
TALIESIN: We had, like, three iterations of me
before I was really functional, I think.

518
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:13,861
MATT: Yeah, and then I had to completely create
the 5th-edition transition for your gunslinger,

519
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:15,494
but other than that.

520
00:43:15,494 --> 00:43:22,171
LAURA: I almost switched. When we switched over to
5th edition, there was that alternate path for

521
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:30,964
ranger that I feel is actually way cooler than the
beastmaster. Yeah, that's why you home-brewed so

522
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:36,092
much of it, and it was awesome. But it was like,
Trinket. What am I going to do? I have to have

523
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:38,873
Trinket, he's Trinket! So I stuck with it.

524
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:40,987
SAM: You could leave the bear. Leave the bear
behind.

525
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:42,975
LAURA: Leave Doty. How about you just leave Doty?

526
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,913
SAM: Doty works.

527
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,584
LAURA: Doty stands around and he's heavy and he's
slow.

528
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:54,686
SAM: And he writes my every word! Wouldn't you
want that in real life? Wouldn't you want a guy

529
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:56,322
right behind you all the time?

530
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:58,826
TALIESIN: I will admit, I really like Matt's
Doty-face.

531
00:43:58,826 --> 00:44:02,294
LAURA: Yeah, it is really great.

532
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:06,014
TALIESIN: It's like a cartoon bird.

533
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:09,406
MATT: Thank you very much.

534
00:44:09,406 --> 00:44:11,072
BRIAN: Who's next?

535
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:15,853
TRAVIS: Step into the light!

536
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,146
LAURA: (gasps) Fun buns!

537
00:44:18,146 --> 00:44:19,548
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

538
00:44:19,548 --> 00:44:20,684
DIANE: I'm Diane.

539
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:22,955
LAURA: Oh wait, those are ears. They look like fun
buns from up here.

540
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:30,826
DIANE: No, they're ears. My question is to the
panel. Has Matt always been this sadistic, or is

541
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:32,697
he really working at it?

542
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:35,870
MATT and LAURA: Always.

543
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,037
BRIAN: That is a great question.

544
00:44:38,037 --> 00:44:45,243
SAM: He's been really bad lately, but at the
beginning of the game, he was very supportive and

545
00:44:45,243 --> 00:44:56,661
he wanted us to enjoy. He's like a dealer, right?
He hooks you with some easy kills, and then slips

546
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:59,694
you the hard stuff. Then he's got you.

547
00:44:59,694 --> 00:45:04,067
MATT: There has to be, you know, ebb and flow.
There has to be some encounters that are

548
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:08,706
relatively not as challenging so you can really
enjoy the power that you've acquired as a

549
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,862
character. Then there have to be challenges along
the way to make you feel like it's a terrible,

550
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:14,460
difficult circumstance. Yeah.

551
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,932
LIAM: Matt is generally one of the kindest people
I've ever met, but those quiet waters run deep,

552
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:27,206
man. You don't know what's under the surface.
(hums Jaws theme)

553
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:33,381
MARISHA: Having the entire party strung up on a
tree in Whitestone, that's when I was like, Who

554
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:38,963
<i>are</i> you? Who am I sleeping next to every night?
Oh god!

555
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:44,561
MATT: Hi. I have a love for gothic horror, I'm
sorry!

556
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,733
MARISHA: What do you dream?

557
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:49,700
MATT: I dream of trees.

558
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:58,046
BRIAN: We should move on before this engagement
falls apart. Thank you very much. Before our very

559
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:03,293
eyes! How was WonderCon? Well, we saw the breakup
of an engagement. Who's next?

560
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:10,722
LIAM: I had it too, though. When Gilmore shanked
Vax, in my mind, I was like, how dare you! How

561
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:13,160
<i>dare</i> you!

562
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,327
MATT: There was a reason.

563
00:46:15,327 --> 00:46:20,630
MARISHA: And this past game, you punished Travis
for using big words!

564
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:26,892
MATT: Because it was funny! And Travis agrees!

565
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:32,361
TRAVIS: Yeah, I caught that. I did it right at the
same time, I was like, Agh! It hurts!

566
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:36,767
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

567
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:44,412
KYRIE: I'm Kyrie. Hi! My question was for Matt.
What's your favorite mini that you've used in the

568
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:49,384
game so far? Marisha, does he sit on the floor at
home going, "Grr! Argh!" with them?

569
00:46:49,384 --> 00:47:00,727
MARISHA: Sometimes. Not lying. Every time he gets
a new Dwarven Forge set, he plays house.

570
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:09,003
BRIAN: Periscope! Periscope!

571
00:47:09,003 --> 00:47:15,878
MATT: It's practicing and rehearsing and learning
techniques for the show, guys! That's totally it!

572
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:25,767
No, to be fair, for a good ten years since they
first announced it, and I couldn't afford it, I've

573
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:33,859
always looked at a distance from the colossal red
dragon mini. The colossal mini. Just could never

574
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:41,338
get it. When you guys, as a community, sent two of
them? It was like a long-time Christmas coming

575
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:47,907
that finally arrived. Those are centerpieces that
I'm still proud of to this day. Then somebody sent

576
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:53,557
me a painted Tarrasque that's just waiting for the
day that it gets to be unleashed! That's pretty

577
00:47:53,557 --> 00:47:55,506
fun too. That's going to be good.

578
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:56,904
TRAVIS: No. No.

579
00:47:56,904 --> 00:47:58,599
BRIAN: Hard pass from Travis on that.

580
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:04,740
MATT: So yeah, definitely probably those two.
Thank you.

581
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:11,975
BRIAN: Who is up next? Yeah! Hey, what's your
name?

582
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:20,447
SEAN: Sean. Hi. I wanted to start with a little,
Matt and Liam, you inspired me to be a DM. Laura,

583
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:25,165
Marisha, and Ashley, you are three of my greatest
female role models, even though Ashley's not here.

584
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:32,829
Sam and Taliesin, you significantly improved my
wit, and Travis, I've started working out. I

585
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:42,519
swear. My question is, when Tary's book is finally
released, like Volo and Elminster did, will Vox

586
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,140
Machina release an annotated copy?

587
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:55,155
SAM: Did he say when Tary dies? Oh. Will I write one in
real life, is that the question?

588
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:59,809
LAURA: No, the question is will Vox Machina
release a second one with the truth.

589
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:08,997
SAM: Sorry, I was really not listening at all. I
actually sat down the other night to maybe write a

590
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:11,257
little bit of a book.

591
00:49:11,257 --> 00:49:12,455
MATT: Do it, that'd be awesome!

592
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:15,097
SAM: Yeah, I really did. I don't know what's going
to happen.

593
00:49:15,097 --> 00:49:17,629
MATT: That'd be a lot of fun! Would you guys like
to see that?

594
00:49:17,629 --> 00:49:20,397
(cheering)

595
00:49:20,397 --> 00:49:26,772
SAM: I don't know. I will see how far I get. We'll
release it and they can all annotate it and cross

596
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:28,071
stuff out.

597
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:33,590
MATT: Oh my god, that'd be so funny to see
everything from his perspective. Good suggestion.

598
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,458
BRIAN: All right, who's up now?

599
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:41,420
LAURA: Oh, I see a costume.

600
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,357
BRIAN: What's your name?

601
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:47,829
JOEL: I'm Joel. Favorite magical item?

602
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:50,133
MATT: Favorite magical item?

603
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:51,965
TRAVIS: Deck of Many Things!

604
00:49:51,965 --> 00:49:55,316
LAURA: Broom of Flying!

605
00:49:55,316 --> 00:50:01,647
MARISHA: I'm a little partial to the Dust of
Tracelessness, just because then I get to hear

606
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:06,891
Travis say, "I do the Dust of Tracelessness with
my flower girl routine."

607
00:50:06,891 --> 00:50:15,392
TALIESIN: I like the milk/water/mayonnaise jar.

608
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:16,958
MATT: The Alchemical Jug?

609
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:21,932
LIAM: Grog with the Bag of Holding has brought us
so much joy.

610
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:28,577
MARISHA: Basically all the things Grog has. All of
Grog's stuff.

611
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:32,512
LAURA: The amount of dried poo that's probably
floating around in the Bag of Holding.

612
00:50:32,512 --> 00:50:34,724
LIAM: The worst dimension ever.

613
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:37,494
MATT: The Grog dimension.

614
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:42,636
TRAVIS: What you fools haven't realized is that I
have amassed all the magical power in the

615
00:50:42,636 --> 00:50:44,859
universe. I'm going to kill all of you.

616
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:47,127
BRIAN: He's turned into Thanos.

617
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:54,837
TRAVIS: I'm going to hot-glue it all to an oven
mitt and be like, I am now the strongest in the

618
00:50:54,837 --> 00:50:56,103
world!

619
00:50:56,103 --> 00:51:02,721
LAURA: The greatest part is how detailed Travis's
list is for the Bag of Holding. I mean, it is

620
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:07,248
like, from the beginning of our game, every single
thing written down in there.

621
00:51:07,248 --> 00:51:10,048
TALIESIN: That Asmodeus ring, that was a deep cut,
man.

622
00:51:10,048 --> 00:51:12,231
TRAVIS: We got dried poo in that bag.

623
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:15,192
LAURA: That's what I'm saying, I know there is
dried poo in there.

624
00:51:15,192 --> 00:51:22,801
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's like three pieces in there.
You know, some people collect sand from different

625
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:26,271
beaches? I got to take poop.

626
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:30,249
BRIAN: Some people collect poop from different
bitches. Who's up next?

627
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:35,042
MATT: My answer, real fast, to that, because I
feel it needs a mention, is Craven Edge. Just

628
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:37,890
because the Grog interactions were so much fun.

629
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,970
BRIAN: Yes, look at this! What's your name?

630
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,478
LAURA: Oh my god! You look beautiful!

631
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:50,549
CHRISTINA: Hi guys, my name's Christina. So, I
have a question for Taliesin and Matt, actually.

632
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:56,762
With Percival's love of these demon deals, and
Matt's newfound love of demon litigation with that

633
00:51:56,762 --> 00:52:02,447
contract, in the Hells, can we expect a sort of
version of soul claims court at this point? Over

634
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:03,731
Percy's soul?

635
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:06,903
SAM: The people's court.

636
00:52:06,903 --> 00:52:09,935
TALIESIN: Some sort of soul litigation?

637
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:16,072
MATT: I guess we'll have to find out. I mean, it
depends on whether or not the first person the

638
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:22,982
deal was made with still exists, and if it does--
And there is actually a place in the Hells for

639
00:52:22,982 --> 00:52:29,390
people that are contesting contracts. There is a
pit fiend, Baatezu, who is there as the judge that

640
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:34,361
is part of the process of you trying to appeal
your contract when your soul arrives. Usually goes

641
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:37,099
poorly anyway, but there are a few that get off.
It's kind of fun.

642
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:38,771
LIAM: Sounds like Hell within a Hell.

643
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:46,743
TALIESIN: Do a little Faust play. Mephistopheles.

644
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:52,151
MATT: I guess we'll see, if you take the other
pacts. Or break this one.

645
00:52:52,151 --> 00:52:59,754
TALIESIN: I'm a little worried. I don't know, Hell
makes me very nervous right now, I've got to

646
00:52:59,754 --> 00:53:01,391
admit. I'm a little nervous.

647
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:02,795
TRAVIS: Nah, you're fine.

648
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:04,859
MARISHA: Remember, this is fine.

649
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:19,379
BRIAN: Great question, even better costume. And it
lights up? The bow lights up? Hell yeah! Somebody

650
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:24,514
get you a prize. We've got time for two more.
Let's move quick, so we can get them in. Hey,

651
00:53:24,514 --> 00:53:25,794
what's your name?

652
00:53:25,794 --> 00:53:36,365
ASHLEY: Hi, I'm Ashley. So, in the earlier parts
of the show, you guys were given the jerky that

653
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:44,372
had a very specific smell. We have our own
homemade jerky that we would like to give to you.

654
00:53:44,372 --> 00:53:47,363
I'm wondering what would be the best route to get
it to you.

655
00:53:47,363 --> 00:53:49,142
TRAVIS: Just throw it from where you are.

656
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:53,010
LIAM: Said the woman covered in blood?

657
00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:00,322
SAM: So you, a stranger covered in blood, want to
give us raw meat? Okay.

658
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:03,429
TALIESIN: I usually only accept meat from friends
covered in blood.

659
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:12,972
MARISHA: There are a few Geek &amp; Sundry reps that
are watching right now. They'll come up, like

660
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:20,106
Eddie over here who's waving his hands, or Chris
who's walking toward you in a very dedicated

661
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:24,094
manner. Talk to one of them, they'll help you
out.

662
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:29,238
BRIAN: Okay, last question. Sorry guys. Who's up
last?

663
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:42,918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is for Sam. What is
Scanlan doing right now in the story? What do you

664
00:54:42,918 --> 00:54:44,425
think he'd be doing right now?

665
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:48,520
SAM: What is he doing right now? That is a good
question. Me and Matt are going to meet this week

666
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:59,970
to figure that out. I could go one of two ways.
He's either in a gutter somewhere sort of blitzed

667
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:10,896
out of his mind with children peeing on him, or he
has killed two people in a casino somewhere and is

668
00:55:10,896 --> 00:55:17,125
being showered in gold. That's it.

669
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:24,994
BRIAN: Thank you guys for asking questions! Thank
you for waiting in line so long! Thank you for

670
00:55:24,994 --> 00:55:40,590
coming! I would like to thank my guests! Cravitz
Fillinghand. Mariska Haritray. Owl-skin Taffy.

671
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:56,238
Jean-Claude van Sam Fecal. Mausoleum Robe Tie-In.
Fedora, Maybe? And our fearless leader, the one

672
00:55:56,238 --> 00:56:03,808
and only Path Traverser. Give it up for the cast
of Critical Role! Don't forget to love each other,

673
00:56:03,808 --> 00:56:10,115
and it's almost kind of Thursday! We love you
guys, thank you!

674
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:29,936
