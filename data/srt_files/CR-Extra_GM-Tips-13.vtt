NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
MATT: Hello. My name is Matthew Mercer. 
I'm a voice actor and the Dungeon Master

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.331
on Critical Role here at Geek &amp; Sundry, 
and today's topic is the

00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:11.371
nuts and bolts behind actual magical-- 
I shouldn't say actual, because we're

00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.990
not actually creating an item. 
That'd be kind of cool but no, we're not doing that.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.040
All right. From the top.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.881
[music]

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.041
Now there are a number of great magical items 
and equipment provided as reward options in many,

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:29.760
many RPG systems. However, sometimes 
either you have inspiration to design and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.782
customize a piece of enchanted gear for 
a member of the adventuring party,

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:37.170
or a magically inclined member of the party 
wishes to craft their own piece of custom loot

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.701
during in-game downtime. 
Well, here are a number of tips

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:43.260
to consider while coming upon either 
of these circumstances.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.121
One, how prevalent are magical items 
in your campaign, and how integral

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.589 line:1
do you want them to be to a PCs ability 
and power level? If you hand them out rather

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.310 line:1
often, perhaps you would want to keep 
the enchantment fairly light and situational,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.331 line:1
adding it to their toolbox. 
If you prefer to build the mystique of magical items,

00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:03.130
gifting them rather infrequently, consider 
making them a little more robust in description

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.923
and function, therefore, it's a more special 
occasion when it's actually presented for them.

00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:10.625 line:1
I'd say read up on the suggested rules on 
magical item distribution.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.951 line:1
Most systems will have a section written 
for GMs describing the intended PC levels for certain items.

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:19.272
Use those as a gauge regarding the 
general amount of power you want to

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:23.251
give any custom items so as not to overbalance 
the party because once you do that,

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:28.950
it's a little hard to reel it back, buddy. 
If there is none, err on the side of less

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.881
than more at first. If the item appears to be 
a dud shortly after granting it,

00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:38.150
you can always have the item suddenly evolve 
or exhibit new qualities that improve its usefulness

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.292
as they progress further in the game.

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:45.155
Often you're creating a new magical item
with a specific PC or PCs in mind.

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:49.551 line:1
Now consider what that PC is missing, 
or what benefit would make for a fun and engaging

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:55.172 line:1
enchantment for that PC. Are they generally 
grounded and lack ranged attacks to deal with flying foes?

00:01:55.172 --> 00:01:59.840
Perhaps a benefit that enables a ranged strike 
or method of temporarily reaching a distant foe

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.131
so they don't feel completely useless 
in those situations. Now try not to load down

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:08.339
a new magical item with a laundry list 
of abilities too early into a campaign.

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:13.552
It can seem overwhelming to non-veteran players 
and most of those cool abilities will go forgotten and unused.

00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:17.850
Some really good items can come with a cost, 
like a curse that inhabits the item and isn't

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.072
revealed until used. They must quest to 
cleanse the item or find a powerful enough

00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:26.771
healer to break the curse to utilize its true power. 
Maybe something terrible is also seeking

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:33.082
the item and as long as you wield it, you know
you are slowly being stalked by the previous owner.

NOTE Paragraph

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:37.191
Some magical items can be sentient, 
either harboring the soul of the creator

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.762
or a previous owner, or the item was instilled 
with life essence when crafted.

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:45.140 line:1
Consider the personality elements of the 
NPC persona locked within.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.774 line:1
What are their goals? Their hatreds? 
What would they not tolerate in a wielder?

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:54.395
Perhaps you design a series of magical items that, 
on their own, carry a meager enchantment,

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:58.091
but when worn with other items from 
the set the benefits increase.

00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:04.680
Now the search is on for other members of 
the item's family. Aw... family. Bringing people together.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.163
Now the monetary worth of the item can 
follow the suggested worth in recommended

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:13.482
RPG systems, but also keep in mind that what 
an item is worth is far more than most merchants

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:17.471
are willing to pay for it. I mean, after all, 
that's how they make a profit.

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.421 line:1
So when considering the party selling back 
magical items through the game, merchants

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:26.393 line:1
will generally try and barter from anywhere 
from half to a quarter of what it's worth.

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:29.922
Then you can go ahead and gauge your 
social encounter and how much they actually

00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:32.332
pay for it, based on the success of the party.

00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:36.512
Now some players may have access to materials 
and resources in game to create and enchant

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:40.829
their own magical accessories. If so, 
here are a number of things to consider,

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.032
as well as some tips to keep in mind.

00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:47.631 line:1
How often do you imagine the adventuring party 
will be able to have downtime during the adventure

00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:51.980 line:1
you've set out for them? If it's not very often, 
consider truncating the recommended crafting

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.380 line:1
time to allow the PC the chance to occasionally 
make use of their skills in this.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.173 line:1
If the player wants to create a new, original 
magical item, let them pitch you the gist of their item.

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:05.382 line:1
Maybe even send you a mock-up of the item 
from their perspective. Now take that item

00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:10.101 line:1
and compare it to other existing magical items
of similar or equal intended power level.

00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:15.130
You can then adjust the item's power, if needed, 
to befit the level of equipment you wish your

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.311
party to have access to at their current level. 
Adjust the cost, and time required to create

00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:24.180
the item accordingly and let the player know 
the changes you made. If you both can agree on it,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.039
then allow it to be done within the game. Hurrah!

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.052
If the item they wish to create is a bit beyond 
the power level you're comfortable with

00:04:31.052 --> 00:04:35.059
at the moment, you can always let them 
craft a part of it and notify them that some pieces

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:39.353
needed to complete the item must be located, 
recovered, or scrounged from very dangerous

00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:43.701
locales in your world. They can now travel forward 
with the party keeping an eye out for those

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:47.391
missing components while getting excited 
at the prospect of a new piece of equipment

00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:49.932
that they've been working on.

00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:54.331
Anyway, I hope these tips have been useful 
for the implementation of custom items in your campaign.

00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.321
