1
00:00:00,988 --> 00:00:03,127
Due to apparently a fried
motherboard suddenly,

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:05,129
we're not gonna be able to--

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,097
we're gonna have to be
switching cameras tonight

4
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:06,930
so bear with us.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,147
It's gonna be a lot of one shots.

6
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:11,268
Single shots cutting back and forth.

7
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,196
But it'll still be a great episode.

8
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:14,615
Hope you enjoy.

9
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:15,691
Let's go ahead and get to

10
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:16,695
these announcements real fast.

11
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:17,616
Those who haven't seen it,

12
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,129
Dragon+ Magazine put up
today a new issue in which

13
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:21,913
they interviewed me and a bunch of other

14
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:23,551
great DM's that stream

15
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,199
for West Marches and Real Roleplay

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,249
and Highrollers and Chris Perkins himself.

17
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:31,984
So go check that out, the new

18
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:34,064
issue of Dragon+ if you get the chance and

19
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:37,426
maybe find some wisdom in there.

20
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:39,231
Also we just released recently, if--

21
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,113
unless you guys are releasing it now,

22
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:43,332
a new cell phone wallpaper,

23
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:45,573
featuring some of the amazing photography

24
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:49,202
of our recent group's
photo shoot in costume.

25
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,055
So that I think is up
on the social media now.

26
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:52,888
Is that right?

27
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:53,721
Mhm.

28
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,012
Go find it.

29
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,181
It is somewhere on the internet.

30
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,621
LAURA: It's up on
Twitter and on Facebook.

31
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:00,454
There you go.

32
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:03,880
Twitter and Facebook, go find it.

33
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,974
Next up...

34
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:07,377
a really amazing game called Mascarada

35
00:01:07,377 --> 00:01:08,551
that I'm lucky to be a part of.

36
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:10,284
It's on Kickstarter to
finish up their big push

37
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:13,718
for the final polish of the game.

38
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:15,512
If you're looking for a
great kind of isometric,

39
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:17,187
beautifully drawn RPG experience,

40
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:18,593
go check out the Kickstarter and if it's

41
00:01:18,593 --> 00:01:19,954
something you wanna help make

42
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,036
the best it can possibly be, do so,

43
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:24,442
so go check out Mascarada on Kickstarter.

44
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:27,760
Also, this week, or as of last Friday,

45
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,884
the Goblin one-shot that we
did with Marisha and Taliesin

46
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:32,026
and a bunch of other fantastic guests

47
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,508
is up on the Geek and Sundry website

48
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:34,548
if you haven't seen it yet.

49
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:37,282
It's ridiculous and I
think you'll enjoy it.

50
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:38,282
And...

51
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:41,295
Also, as a reminder, that the

52
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:43,271
"How do you want to do this?" sweaters

53
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,613
are still up for pre-order in the store.

54
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,188
Oh wait, but it has to switch.

55
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:48,021
SAM: No, it switches.

56
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:48,923
It switches?

57
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:49,970
SAM: They can switch cameras.

58
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,803
Oh.

59
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:51,636
SAM: Just one at a time.

60
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:52,634
Wait, wait.

61
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,519
And, we finally have the

62
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,740
"How do you want to do this?" T-shirts

63
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,134
back in stock in the shop.

64
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:01,249
So those who missed that,
we finally, finally got them

65
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,552
back up in stock on the website,

66
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,335
so if you're looking for
those, they're available.

67
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,541
LAURA: They're for
pre-order for another week.

68
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,475
There's like modeling happening right now.

69
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,613
And then, I know there was modeling.

70
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:12,553
These European models are
in these smoking hot--

71
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:14,913
Oh, who? These European models?

72
00:02:14,913 --> 00:02:16,666
MATT: Look, they see
something fascinating far away

73
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,697
and they're turning to see it.

74
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:19,114
Oh, look at that.

75
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:23,862
[audio silence]

76
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:25,287
Liam?

77
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:26,120
What?

78
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,873
Oh man I hope in the last
hour, I hope in the last hour,

79
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:30,274
where you had all this time to kill,

80
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:34,186
you went to Wyrmwood Gaming
to get boxes for your dice

81
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,322
where you could use the code Critrole.

82
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,389
Critrole!

83
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,959
To get free shipping.

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,470
Not free boxes, but free
shipping with Critrole.

85
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,680
Also, I think we got one more week

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,857
on their Kickstarter for the sentinel box,

87
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:48,994
you can get this logo on any box, but--

88
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:49,827
Right here.

89
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:51,874
You could also get the Vox Machina box

90
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:53,350
which is pretty sweet.

91
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,229
Inlaid and fancy.

92
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,062
If you're nuts.

93
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,524
I keep a human heart in here.

94
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:58,357
It's true.

95
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,190
Critrole.

96
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,673
(laughing)

97
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:02,506
All right.

98
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:03,339
Anything else, are we good to jump

99
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,321
into this game for tonight?

100
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,154
TRAVIS: Light this candle.

101
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:07,206
LAURA: Let's do it, oh my gosh.

102
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:09,058
Alright folks, let's go
ahead and bring us down

103
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:13,411
back into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

104
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,484
(spooky ethereal music)

105
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,327
(heavy breathing)

106
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,494
(roaring)

107
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:29,352
(dramatic music)

108
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,680
(gun firing)

109
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,081
Welcome back.

110
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,788
So, last we left off,
the party having found

111
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,675
their way back to the city of Westruun,

112
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,948
which had been overrun by the herd of

113
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:59,115
roving nomadic tribal barbarians
and other such brigands

114
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:03,273
that wander the landscape of Talâ€™Dorei

115
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:04,865
that Grog once belonged to,

116
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,796
had swooped in and taken Westruun

117
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:09,833
after the Chroma Conclave dragon attack

118
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,998
across this countryside.

119
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:16,198
The party had devised a plan
to find their way into the town

120
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,638
or at least one of them would,

121
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:21,683
distract a cluster of these
individuals, these Goliaths,

122
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,533
many of which are, you
know, half-giant Goliaths

123
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,885
pulling them out of the
city into a large pit

124
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:27,457
that had been hidden after being carved

125
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:29,571
by the druid Keyleth.

126
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,435
Scanlan went into be the distraction.

127
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,310
Becoming invisible, leaping to the center

128
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,395
of the main town square,

129
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:35,689
right in front of the margrave's house,

130
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:39,772
where apparently the leader
of this clan, Kevdak,

131
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:44,088
which has a long history
with Grog, resides.

132
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:47,188
As part of this distraction,
Scanlan released a thunderwave

133
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:49,694
and in doing so unknowingly
also revealed himself

134
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,967
as the invisibility spell went away.

135
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:55,488
And an entire cluster
of very angry-looking

136
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,580
individuals bared down on him,

137
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,395
managed to escape thanks
to dimension door,

138
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,128
twice and made your way into the

139
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,727
partially ruined Temple of Arathis

140
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:07,293
where you came face to
face with a number of

141
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:10,274
refugee Westruun villagers and

142
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,191
Dr. Dranzel and Kaylee.

143
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:16,128
And that is where we left off so

144
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,933
after appearing and having
a moment of realizing

145
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:22,704
the scenario, you see a handful of people,

146
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:26,371
most of them filthy,
completely beleaguered,

147
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:31,640
and in need of not being
in this circumstance

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,492
as long as they possibly can.

149
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:36,698
And you can see Kaylee kinda
holding them back defensively

150
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,518
and Dranzel, having just
noticed your appearance

151
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:40,137
and calling out to you with a chuckle,

152
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,298
realizing that you're here and

153
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:44,069
Kaylee rolling her eyes,
apparently unable to really escape

154
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,980
through fate, though there
is a look, a brief glance of

155
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,345
appreciation that at least you're not

156
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:53,728
burnt to a crisp somewhere outside Emon.

157
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,842
But Dranzel walks up to you and is like,

158
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:56,675
as hush as he can be,

159
00:06:56,675 --> 00:07:00,258
"Scanlan, so glad to
see that you survived.

160
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,065
"What are you doing here?"

161
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:05,037
SCANLAN: Well...

162
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:06,268
Doctor...

163
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:09,018
there will be plenty of time for,

164
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,757
for festive reunions and...

165
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:15,066
hopefully tearful hellos but right now

166
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:18,307
I'm afraid we have a bit of problem.

167
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:21,992
See, my friends are stationed
outside the main gate,

168
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:24,090
lying in wait for these Goliaths

169
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,105
that are terrorizing the town.

170
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:27,966
My mission was to come in here and

171
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:32,207
somehow convince the Goliaths
to leave through the main gate

172
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:34,219
and my mission is not
complete, and I'm afraid,

173
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,640
well, I've roused them and they're

174
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,336
going to come in here and kill us all.

175
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:44,387
Unless I get them
out through the main gate.

176
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:46,992
So, we're in a bit of a time crunch.

177
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:47,988
Hi.

178
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:50,999
And Doctor, Doctor, you are

179
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,534
such a long friend of mine
and a trusted companion

180
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:57,701
but I'm afraid, though I love
you, I uh - you cannot help me.

181
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:01,119
I need Kaylee's help in this.

182
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:03,406
At which point, Dranzel,

183
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,310
whose face has fallen into a look of

184
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,477
absolute fear and despair to confusion

185
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,153
to mild frustration.

186
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:15,867
Continues still glaring
in your face, goes,

187
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,714
"Well, I guess some things
don't change over time,

188
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:18,833
"you son of a bitch.

189
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,396
(laughing)

190
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,146
"Okay, well, Kaylee?"

191
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,594
And he looks over his shoulder and

192
00:08:24,594 --> 00:08:27,744
Kaylee kinda steps up now
and brushes off her shoulder.

193
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,227
"All right, so what kind of business

194
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,847
"am I getting you out of now, father?"

195
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,083
Well, not just, not
just getting me out of.

196
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,379
I'm afraid, I'm afraid we'll
all die if you don't help.

197
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,003
KAYLEE: "Great, great, that's fantastic."

198
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:42,836
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:43,953
"You've just banished all of these

200
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:45,398
"fine folks to their demise.

201
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:46,255
"Do you feel good?"

202
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:48,396
No, no I haven't, not if you help, so...

203
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:51,668
Listen, I've been
thinking a lot about you,

204
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,487
and it's so wonderful to see you and

205
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,951
I just need you to trust me in this and,

206
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:01,785
and lend me your talents
and your magic if you can.

207
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,785
Will you trust me today?

208
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:08,145
"Doesn't seem like I really
have much of a choice."

209
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:10,289
At which point you hear
in the outside footfalls,

210
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:12,245
heavy footfalls, going in the street

211
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:13,873
on the outside of the
temple and you hear some

212
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:15,189
shouting muffled in the distance.

213
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,171
(muffled shouting)

214
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:20,982
(mimics heavy footsteps)

215
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:24,758
Everyone kinda stays
really still and silent.

216
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:26,008
And then you...

217
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:29,219
Hear a few more footsteps.

218
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,603
(mimics footsteps)

219
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,797
(mimics loud crash)

220
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,808
On a partially broken door of the temple,

221
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,350
some heavy hand falls hit
and everyone just kinda

222
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,994
ducks down and the air
leaves the room entirely.

223
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:46,013
At which point there's a moment of pause,

224
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:50,122
and the door begins to push
open against all the rocks

225
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,283
and this barricade that's
been placed against the door

226
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:56,450
slides against the ground,
opens ever so slightly.

227
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:02,346
Quiet still stands and you
see these fingers come through

228
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,544
and pull it and another voice say,

229
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:08,711
"Hey, give me a hand here,
this one's barricaded."

230
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,288
The door slides a couple more inches

231
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,574
and you see an arm come through.

232
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:17,570
Now holding against the side of the room.

233
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,111
Another arm comes out.

234
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,228
Shit.

235
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:23,664
Can I grab Kaylee and get everyone to,

236
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,335
is there anywhere to hide in this room?

237
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:26,882
Any place in the back?

238
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:28,887
We'll it's a partially collapsed, like,

239
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,148
half-ceiling area that's part of the

240
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:31,923
temple on the second floor.

241
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,053
There is an area beneath
the spiral staircase

242
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,380
that leads to the second floor

243
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,779
that can fit most of the people there.

244
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,612
Okay.

245
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:42,893
I'm going to very quickly,
and with her help,

246
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,600
usher everybody back into this back stair.

247
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,433
MATT: Okay.

248
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:49,266
Turn around, blow my horn of fog

249
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:52,273
to fill the room partially with smoke.

250
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:53,251
MATT: Okay.

251
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:56,518
And then I'm going to tell Kaylee,

252
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:59,370
can you throw your voice?

253
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,350
After that.

254
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,751
(mimics horn)

255
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,053
Just fills with this heavy, heavy mist,

256
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,694
obscuring the vision of
most everyone in the room

257
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:08,036
that isn't directly at your side.

258
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,638
You hear the voice at the door go,

259
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:11,816
"Hey, what's that coming out here?"

260
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,296
And then now fighting
heavily against the door

261
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:14,553
and it's slamming against the barricade.

262
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,465
(mimics banging and slamming)

263
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:20,564
Kaylee, kind of getting a
feel for what's happening.

264
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:22,814
"All right, what can I do?"

265
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,714
You can throw your voice, I've
seen you do it once, right.

266
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:28,547
KAYLEE: I can, I can.

267
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,481
Can you change your voice?

268
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,632
I can.

269
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:33,255
Okay.

270
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:34,338
Can you be...

271
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,861
the scariest fucking
voice you've ever done

272
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,153
in your entire life?

273
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:42,053
I will tell you what to
say, I'll whisper it to you.

274
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:45,260
You just be the voice, I will
be the visuals, all right?

275
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,111
I'm gonna create an image,

276
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:49,098
and you're going to talk
out of it, all right?

277
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:50,009
All right, all right.

278
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:50,842
Let's go.

279
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,099
Okay.

280
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,996
So I will use just a minor illusion

281
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:59,209
to create the head of Stonejaw Strongjaw.

282
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,814
Yes!

283
00:12:00,814 --> 00:12:01,754
MATT: Jaw Jaw?

284
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,138
ALL: Jaw Jaw!

285
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,869
(laughing)

286
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:07,528
TRAVIS: Okay, I like this.

287
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:08,746
(laughing)

288
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:09,908
LIAM: Aw, me so sorry.

289
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,158
(laughing)

290
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,028
GROG: You talkin' about my family now?

291
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:17,856
(laughing)

292
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:19,189
All right, so.

293
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:22,183
GROG: I'm no fuckin' Gungan.

294
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,433
(laughing)

295
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:26,754
So.

296
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,697
As the essence of minor illusion,

297
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:31,181
it is a very, very simple illusion.

298
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:32,014
SAM: For sure.

299
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:35,847
As far as I know, it
can't even really move.

300
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,154
SAM: Yeah.

301
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:39,987
It can be an image.

302
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:40,820
Yeah, that's fine.

303
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,390
It's gonna be floating amongst fog.

304
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,196
Okay, so within this fog,

305
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,662
you see as they push through the door,

306
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:48,555
the barricade clatters down.

307
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:50,370
A section of a table and a chair and

308
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,750
a lot of the rubble that was kinda scooped

309
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,802
up from the roof that had caved in

310
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,309
jammed against this
door gets skirted back,

311
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,702
tumbles and clatters
across the stone work.

312
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:01,571
And you see one Goliath

313
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,280
and one kind of rough-looking human

314
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,884
with a ragged beard come rushing in.

315
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,301
You know, dual hand axes drawn

316
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,480
and looking about the fog as suddenly,

317
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,147
out of the middle of this space,

318
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:16,220
a giant semi-translucent disembodied head

319
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,387
of what you recall is a
(laughs) Stonejaw Strongjaw.

320
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:25,598
(laughing)

321
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,048
MARISHA: Wilson.

322
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:27,881
Wilson.

323
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,547
Standing there, leaning
forward at a large,

324
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,130
though, you know...

325
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,082
I will say, though, initially,
what is your DC on this?

326
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,476
It's through the hand cone.

327
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:41,919
So it's 20.

328
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,752
Okay.

329
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:43,585
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

330
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:45,029
They both stop and just kinda go,

331
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,158
"Uh...

332
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,606
(laughing)

333
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:49,977
"Are you seeing what I'm seeing?"

334
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,109
The human's like,

335
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:52,942
"Yeah."

336
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,080
And there's just a moment of pause there,

337
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,255
and Kaylee's looking at you like...

338
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:00,192
Okay, really quick,
here's your motivation.

339
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,021
You're a dead Goliath,

340
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:06,367
you were killed in combat
by one of your own.

341
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,288
And you probably sound
really scary and fucked up.

342
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:09,121
Ready, go.

343
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:13,972
Okay I tell her I am Stonejaw Strongjaw.

344
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:15,728
She puts her hands together and

345
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:19,390
clasps almost like the grass
reeds that you blow into.

346
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,486
But as she speaks into her hand,

347
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:23,736
it sends out these rippling, kind of...

348
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:27,230
Almost like a heat distortion

349
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,795
that kind of just
scatters out from her hand

350
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:31,463
and outside of this central illusion,

351
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,916
you hear a voice, comes booming forward,

352
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,124
"I--"

353
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,171
SAM: Fuck yes.

354
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,254
"Am Stonejaw Strongjaw.

355
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,468
"Returned from the realm of the dead."

356
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:44,959
Yes, yes, yes, that's good.

357
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,247
Keep going, keep going,
you're doing great!

358
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:48,147
I love you!

359
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:49,193
Okay, uh--

360
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:51,063
(laughing)

361
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:55,230
Kevdak's son Zanror killed
me in dishonorable combat!

362
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,244
(laughing)

363
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,911
"Kevdak's son Zanror killed me

364
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,737
"in dishonorable combat!"

365
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,660
I can't go to the other side

366
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,531
until I have avenged my death.

367
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:14,427
"I cannot move on to the other side

368
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,927
"until I've avenged my death!"

369
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,801
(laughing)

370
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,051
(growling)

371
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:31,736
The Goliath goes, "Sorry, then."

372
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,777
(laughing)

373
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,385
As he steps out of the room,

374
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,841
the guy with the straggled beard who

375
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:40,948
you gather is of a different type

376
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,879
of a tribal background than the Goliaths,

377
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,212
just kind of gleans an eye untrustingly.

378
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,447
"Yeah, Strongjaw, you say,

379
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,725
"how strong is that jaw of yours?"

380
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:54,534
And throws an ax towards it.

381
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:57,692
It just passes through
and clatters behind.

382
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:58,525
Okay.

383
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:02,358
Quick, say "You idiot,
I am but a projection".

384
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:05,725
"You idiot!

385
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,541
(laughing)

386
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,282
"I am but a projection!"

387
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:13,678
The real Stonejaw is currently
outside the main gate,

388
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:17,595
waiting for a battle of
revenge against Zanror.

389
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:19,576
Send him now.

390
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,170
MARISHA: That's a lot.
SAM: I know.

391
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,234
Sorry, Kaylee.

392
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:26,401
"The real Zanror stands outside
this city gate, waiting...

393
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:34,747
"For vengeance against Zanror!"

394
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:37,395
You're doing great, you're doing great!

395
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:40,978
"Bring him now, or you all shall suffer!"

396
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,245
That last part was improv!

397
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:44,387
That was amazing, Kaylee!

398
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:45,858
(laughing)

399
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:48,108
(grunting)

400
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,509
There's like a slight pause.

401
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,080
"Can I have my axe back?"

402
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,913
I motion to Dr. Dra to
throw it back to him.

403
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:07,261
He runs over, feels for it, looks around.

404
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,247
SAM: Throw it hard!

405
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,241
"I will throw it hard!"

406
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:14,300
No, no, don't say that
part, don't say that part!

407
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,133
(laughing)

408
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:15,996
It's fine, you're doing great.

409
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,338
He starts backing up towards the door.

410
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,872
At which point, the ax
just clatters past him,

411
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:23,608
slams into the door behind him.

412
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:27,309
He reaches up without
looking and he grabs it.

413
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:28,288
"Thank you."

414
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:30,024
The main gate, the main gate!

415
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:31,774
"The main gate."

416
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,170
SAM: Wow!

417
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,631
"There's like four gates into the city.

418
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:35,930
"Which main gate?"

419
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,101
I don't know, do I know
what it looks like?

420
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:38,934
MATT: The western one.

421
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:39,987
The western gate, the western gate!

422
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:41,737
"The western gate!"

423
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:43,795
(laughing)

424
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,943
"Right, right, I'll let him know."

425
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:47,013
And he just leaves.

426
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:48,381
Doesn't even touch the door,
he just bolts out the back.

427
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,597
(laughing)

428
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:52,203
LAURA: Oh man, I love this so much.

429
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:53,785
There's a moment of quiet.

430
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:56,275
(laughing)

431
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,141
I just hope that works.

432
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:59,290
Dr. Dranzel walks by.

433
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,864
(chuckles)

434
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,633
"I have to say, you two
make quite the team."

435
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:07,383
I would say that as well, yes, I would.

436
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:09,748
Thank you, Kaylee, that was...

437
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:11,943
Better than I could have ever done.

438
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,110
That's true.

439
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:16,473
"All right then, so...

440
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:18,498
"We're getting people out of here.

441
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,105
"Things have gone a bit up.

442
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:23,813
"How are we gonna get the
rest of these folks out?"

443
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:26,022
And Dranzel thinks for a second, he goes,

444
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,663
"Well, we can't wait for
the rest of the team.

445
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:32,199
"They're probably still on
their way back from Kymal.

446
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,416
"I've unfortunately mostly spent

447
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,011
"my capabilities for the day.

448
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:39,013
"Scanlan, what do you got?"

449
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:40,846
To keep us all safe?

450
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:44,283
"No, to get the rest of
these poor saps out!"

451
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:46,191
Out of the city?

452
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,884
Jesus, uh...

453
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,929
"Were you gonna leave
them here unguarded?"

454
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,235
Oh, no, of course I'm not
gonna leave them unguarded!

455
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:54,029
I just, I mean, we can't...

456
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:56,098
How many people are here?

457
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,931
You look around the room,
there's nine people.

458
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:09,228
I can get me and Kaylee out.

459
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,478
(laughing)

460
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,003
I think we should just hunker down.

461
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:18,307
(laughs)

462
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,807
I can't get us out, I'm sorry!

463
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:23,293
I mean, we could sneak, we could sneak,

464
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:25,066
we could try to make a sneak for it.

465
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:26,892
Are there sewers here?

466
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,105
Kaylee nods.

467
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:30,920
"There are sewers, aye."

468
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,753
Close by?

469
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,086
Is there an entrance nearby?

470
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,201
"About two blocks that way."

471
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:38,476
And she points to the
south side of the city.

472
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:39,309
Okay.

473
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,485
KAYLEE: "Should we wait for your friends,

474
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:42,161
or should we go ahead
and take this route?"

475
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:43,003
We should wait and make sure that

476
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,378
we hear Goliath footsteps leaving the city

477
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,711
before we move, and then go.

478
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,465
"All right.

479
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:52,027
"Let's take a moment
and make sure at least

480
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:54,944
"all the chaos is moving that way."

481
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,199
Quiet takes over as the fog slowly fades

482
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,669
over the next few minutes,
and we all stay out of sight.

483
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,112
Now, the rest of you guys
are currently waiting

484
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:06,728
on the outskirts of the
western side of town.

485
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:10,952
You hear the bells going
off in the distance.

486
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:12,202
You hear the...

487
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,945
The sound of shouts as the
guards that were at that post

488
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:17,651
start stepping back inward,

489
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,594
trying to figure out what's going on.

490
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,746
At this distance, it's hard to make out

491
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,412
exactly what conversation is happening,

492
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:24,558
but the energy of the outside of the city

493
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,769
has definitely climbed up a few paces.

494
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,648
Which leads you to believe,

495
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:32,209
hopefully, this means
Scanlan's done his job.

496
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:33,704
We shall find out.

497
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:34,537
Is there any other preparation

498
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,458
you guys wanna go through right now,

499
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,721
or are you just waiting to
see any sign of movement?

500
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:39,880
Are we all, like, together

501
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,706
or are we spread out across everything?

502
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:43,599
We're birds.

503
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,432
LAURA: You're birds.

504
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:45,265
MARISHA: We're birds on a wall.

505
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:47,873
We're standing together
in, like, the tall grass.

506
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:48,833
That's right.

507
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,666
Okay.

508
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:51,869
LAURA: We're with everybody else.

509
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,601
I'm gonna take a minute to--

510
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:55,191
anybody standing near me, I'm gonna

511
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:57,524
take a minute and use, um...

512
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:00,796
Where's my thing?

513
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:02,701
I'm freaking out!

514
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:04,534
Hide in plain sight?

515
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:05,367
MATT: All righty.

516
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:08,315
And make it to where we can
set a surprise attack on them.

517
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:09,636
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Anybody coming out.

518
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:10,528
All right.

519
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:11,361
All right.

520
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:12,194
So, as part of that, I'll have you guys

521
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:14,277
both roll stealth checks.

522
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:17,819
LIAM: Sure.

523
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,808
(laughing)

524
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:20,902
Do we still, is the Pass Without Trace

525
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:22,885
still active from before?

526
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:23,718
I think it is.

527
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,490
I think you cast it before you arrived,

528
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,701
or in the approach, so, yeah.

529
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:29,153
LAURA: Okay, so add 10 to that.

530
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,567
LIAM: 35.
LAURA: 35!

531
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:31,871
MATT: Oh, look at that.

532
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:33,871
Hopefully that's enough.

533
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:37,526
It's like that scene in Willow where--

534
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:38,790
TALIESIN: All right, um, since we're birds.

535
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,957
I want to take it, just an
occasional high-level...

536
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,054
MARISHA: Circle around?
TALIESIN: Circle around,

537
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,266
just to see what's up.

538
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:51,266
Okay, both of you guys
roll perception checks.

539
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:53,648
MARISHA: 26.

540
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,227
TALIESIN: Uh, 18.

541
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:56,060
MATT: 26, 18?

542
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,893
Yeah.

543
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:57,726
Oh.

544
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:59,653
(excited heavy breathing)

545
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,287
LAURA: Oh, see, that's
what we could do, Matt!

546
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,812
We could've just sat you on the

547
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:03,733
same side of the table as us.

548
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:05,315
Yeah, you could've been behind us and...

549
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:06,202
MATT: Oh, that's true.

550
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:07,035
That is true.

551
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,541
Oh well, too late now.

552
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,874
All right, so...

553
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,767
(whispers inaudibly)

554
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:16,632
Any products you want me to
hawk while the camera's on us?

555
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,040
Those shirts, man!

556
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,873
SAM: These shirts?

557
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:19,706
Not those shirts, these shirts!

558
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,809
How do you wanna do this?

559
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:21,943
How do you wanna do this?

560
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,007
We already hawked those.

561
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,114
TRAVIS: The hoodie and the T-shirt!

562
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:24,947
T-shirts in stock, one more week.

563
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:25,950
How do you want to do this?

564
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,329
T-shirts are now available for something.

565
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:29,872
Pre-order?

566
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:31,189
LAURA: Also pre-order for another week.

567
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:32,179
I don't know, man!

568
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:33,841
Also, also the necklaces and

569
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:35,399
the keychains are still there.

570
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,670
Necklaces and keychains?

571
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,586
But those are a fantastic
birthday or Christmas gift.

572
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:39,419
LAURA: They really are!

573
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,449
ASHLEY: What are the necklaces?

574
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:41,282
LAURA: The necklaces?

575
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:42,115
We still haven't gotten to those!

576
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:42,948
Arbor Day seems like a good--

577
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:43,781
Memorial Day.

578
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:44,614
Memorial Day!

579
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,661
People give gifts on Memorial Day.

580
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:46,808
I got gifts on Memorial Day.

581
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:47,641
Yeah.

582
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:50,680
So underneath your Memorial
Day tree this year...

583
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
It's cute.

584
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:52,792
It's like steel.

585
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,625
All right.

586
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,458
Oh my gosh.

587
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,824
So.

588
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:56,657
ASHLEY: Umm...

589
00:22:56,657 --> 00:22:57,490
Yes, Pike.

590
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,990
Can I cast Guardian of Faith

591
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:04,735
near us, where we are hiding at the gate?

592
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:05,568
MATT: If you'd like to.

593
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:06,401
Yes.

594
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,353
Uh, on your location on the
gate, or somewhere else?

595
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,849
Because we're all, we're all together

596
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,630
by the hole that you dug.

597
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,463
Aren't we--

598
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:14,296
We're like, in the--

599
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:15,129
We're in the grass.

600
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:16,801
In the grass, down toward the front,

601
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:19,457
kind of farther back from the gate.

602
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:21,514
Where are you guys standing right now?

603
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:22,347
TRAVIS: Are you--

604
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:23,671
'Cause the twins are by themselves, right?

605
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:24,504
Yeah, yeah.

606
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,734
Ah, so we're all apart.

607
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:28,780
Yeah, you and Grog are kind
of your own pod right now.

608
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,613
Oh, hi Grog.

609
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:30,446
Hey.

610
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:31,747
I just forgot you were--

611
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:33,185
Just us chillin'.

612
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:34,018
(laughing)

613
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:36,268
About to split some skulls.

614
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,732
You know what, I'm gonna
pause, I'm gonna pause.

615
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:40,565
MATT: Okay, you gonna hold off?

616
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:41,398
ASHLEY: Yeah.

617
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:42,231
All right, so, you guys,
what are you doing?

618
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:44,307
(mimicking birds)

619
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:45,140
TRAVIS: Jesus.

620
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,841
Okay, I'm on the wall, right?

621
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,865
MATT: Mm-hmm.

622
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:53,556
I'm gonna kind of, like,
scootch back a little bit

623
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:54,389
so I'm kind of hidden.

624
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:56,187
I'm gonna drop my animal form.

625
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:57,295
MATT: Okay.

626
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,376
I'm gonna go over the...

627
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:00,543
Our earpieces.

628
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,357
MATT: Mm-hmm.

629
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,593
I'm flying near her so I
can hear, but I can't talk.

630
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,021
MATT: Okay.

631
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,598
It looks like there's
about six coming our way.

632
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:11,941
I don't know how well
Scanlan's distraction worked.

633
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:13,718
It looks like they're double down--

634
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,651
doubling down and setting up a

635
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:17,517
heavy defense in the center of the town.

636
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:19,202
MATT: Is Scanlan
listening to you right now?

637
00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:21,780
Scanlan, can you hear me?

638
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,613
Scanlan?

639
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:23,672
There's no response.

640
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:24,594
MARISHA: Shit.

641
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:26,279
I think he's too far away,
you guys, I don't know.

642
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,565
LAURA: Hopefully he wasn't captured.

643
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:30,412
There's about six coming this way,

644
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:33,389
so stay down, hopefully the trap works.

645
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,619
I just thought of something.

646
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:35,907
Hey, remember when we were, like,

647
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,082
walking through the woods and we

648
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:40,083
fought those six Goliaths
and I stopped the fight?

649
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:40,916
Remember?

650
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,010
Yeah, that was Zanror, right?

651
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,096
Right.

652
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,138
So I think he knows that I'm not, like,

653
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:48,352
back from the dead.

654
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:49,900
Well, shit, Grog!

655
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,881
I know, I just thought
of it, you know, like,

656
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:54,162
the whole magic thing
might not actually work.

657
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:56,045
So the whole plan we made was stupid?

658
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,808
No no no, I'm just saying,
let's move forward.

659
00:24:57,808 --> 00:24:58,987
You're using your father, right?

660
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:00,455
Your father is dead, right?

661
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:01,629
Your dad's dead?

662
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:02,952
LIAM: Yes, yes.
TRAVIS: I don't know.

663
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:03,785
LIAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Yeah, he is, yes.

664
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:04,618
He's dead.

665
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:05,619
(laughing)

666
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:06,452
TRAVIS: Yeah.

667
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:08,010
LAURA: Yeah, he's dead.

668
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,258
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's dead.

669
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,008
Okay, well, hopefully it works.

670
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:14,058
I don't know how well this is working--

671
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:16,547
Just a pro-tip, Vax, what would you say

672
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,064
is the number one thing to keep in mind

673
00:25:18,064 --> 00:25:21,383
when fighting someone like me?

674
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:22,966
LIAM: Uh, don't?

675
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:24,918
Keep your distance.

676
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:26,807
Yeah, keep your distance.

677
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:29,419
All right, good to know.

678
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,586
What's our plan B in case
Zanror never comes out?

679
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:37,405
VEX: We go in and we kill everyone.

680
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,625
VAX: Yeah, pretty much.

681
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,728
Everyone?

682
00:25:39,728 --> 00:25:41,904
Well, except for the nice people.

683
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:42,745
Oh.

684
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:44,018
(laughing)

685
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:48,408
I haven't decided who the nice people are.

686
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:50,040
I think I can confirm that Vox Machina

687
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,970
has been a terrible influence on me,

688
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,856
just want to throw that out.

689
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:53,890
All right, let's go.

690
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,071
LAURA: Where are they, where are they?

691
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,488
I also want to just see if I recognize,

692
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:03,855
I'm just doing another little
flippity-flop scan around,

693
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:05,103
and I just want to see if I recognize

694
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:06,534
his brother as one of the people

695
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:09,240
who's coming to the gate or not.

696
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,630
I'll get down low for that.

697
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,802
Not a brother, per se.

698
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:12,635
TRAVIS: My cousin?

699
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:13,601
Your cousin, I mean.

700
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:16,059
The one I recognize because
I, the only one I've met.

701
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:16,892
MATT: Right.

702
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,331
At this height?

703
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:19,164
I'll get, I'll get--

704
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:19,997
MATT: You'll get low?
TALIESIN: I'll get low.

705
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:23,826
Okay, you don't see anybody
coming towards that direction

706
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:25,135
that resembles the individual that you met

707
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:27,592
that one time before.

708
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:29,151
Okay, fine.

709
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,320
I'm gonna go looking.

710
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,897
However, what you do notice is,

711
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:34,805
and you quickly duck out of the way,

712
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:38,109
there are two giant eagles that come

713
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:41,394
coasting over the city
in the same direction.

714
00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:42,227
(gasps)

715
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,538
TRAVIS: Giant eagles?

716
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:44,850
Okay, I'm gonna go find a perch

717
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,208
on the other side of the gate.

718
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,735
And I'm gonna find a nice
little sniper's nest.

719
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,147
I'm assuming you have some clan members

720
00:26:51,147 --> 00:26:53,897
who might be druids, do you know?

721
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,941
You're speaking really smart right now

722
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,444
and it's confusing me.

723
00:26:58,444 --> 00:26:59,277
(laughing)

724
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:00,696
Make sure you're hiding, Keyleth.

725
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:02,511
I want to stealth, I kind of want to

726
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:03,753
hunker down against the wall and stealth.

727
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:04,593
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

728
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:08,023
I'm staying bird until
the last possible moment.

729
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:09,407
Uh, 21.

730
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:10,240
21?

731
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:11,984
Hmm.

732
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:16,167
VAX: Guys, if no one comes towards the gate

733
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,501
in the next five, ten minutes--

734
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:20,334
KEYLETH: They're on their way.

735
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,167
They're not going to come.

736
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,178
Well, all right, I hope so, but

737
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:23,823
if nobody's here in ten,
I think we gotta go in.

738
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:26,754
MARISHA: So is there anyone coming towards the--

739
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:29,860
At this point in time, you
guys on your side notice,

740
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,441
--and you as well--a cluster
of about six individuals

741
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:35,188
come rushing towards the gate,

742
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:37,076
and the two guards who were
over to the side earlier

743
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:39,801
join up with them, they stop for a second,

744
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:41,867
and they discuss at a distance.

745
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:42,997
Then they all turn and rush

746
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:45,121
towards the gate as a group of nine.

747
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,954
(gasps)

748
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:46,900
Come on, trap!

749
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,817
Work, trap, work, trap!

750
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:50,518
MARISHA: Come on!

751
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:53,745
As they're rushing forward,
it's about three, two,

752
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:55,679
and then a scattered four-ish in the back.

753
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,762
They go bolting through, eyes around,

754
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:02,415
looking for any sort of sight

755
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:04,407
of anyone waiting at
the front of the gate.

756
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:06,679
They begin to slow
their pace a little bit,

757
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:08,392
not seeing anybody immediately out there,

758
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:10,685
as they begin to go through
the center of the archway.

759
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:12,241
Someone make a distraction, quick!

760
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,217
I step out from cover,

761
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,217
very slowly,

762
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:19,202
and walk out in the middle of the room.

763
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:20,035
Oh, shit.

764
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,065
Okay, as you step out, they all

765
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,425
immediately put their hands out and stop

766
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:25,842
and to the guards, shout out,

767
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:28,549
"You, who goes there?"

768
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,246
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing, growling)

769
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,496
(laughing)

770
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,523
"Stonejaw!"

771
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:44,595
(laughing)

772
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:48,762
Two of them, of that group,
start stepping backwards

773
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:52,461
while the two guards that were

774
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:54,926
stationed at the gate, they just go,

775
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:56,371
"Cut him down."

776
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:58,457
And they go into a run
through the rest of,

777
00:28:58,457 --> 00:28:59,903
the ten, fifteen-foot area,

778
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,737
around the center part of the gate

779
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:04,119
out into the main area out front.

780
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,747
As they begin stepping, (mimics footsteps)

781
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:07,733
watching in the distance,

782
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:10,661
you notice one foot crumbles through,

783
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,460
and all of a sudden, the second foot,

784
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,117
and the earth begins to just tumble out

785
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:16,450
from underneath two of them.

786
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:22,173
Three of them, four of them, five of them.

787
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:25,351
All begin just, the first
line, the first two groups,

788
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,613
weren't even paying attention and

789
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:28,318
focused on you as they charged through,

790
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,474
they all begin to tumble inside--

791
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:31,307
Yes!

792
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:36,593
The, uh, of the last four, two of them

793
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,877
manage to stop in time to
kind of catch themselves.

794
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,919
Of all the ones that fell, though,

795
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,372
the ones in front who
originally got caught

796
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:44,214
have no saving throw.

797
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,858
They just plummet, screaming, down--

798
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:46,955
Two managed not to fall?

799
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:47,872
MARISHA: 180 feet.

800
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,555
SAM: It's 180 feet!

801
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,555
SAM: Holy god!

802
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,823
(laughing)

803
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:55,203
TALIESIN: Two managed not to fall?

804
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:58,857
Two manage to avoid the
entire crumbling portion of it

805
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:00,620
and there are three of them that are

806
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,236
currently holding onto the edges

807
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:04,195
and trying to pull themselves back up.

808
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:07,069
Can I find, I want to find
a good enough vantage point

809
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:09,163
where I'm behind them and
I can give them a push.

810
00:30:09,163 --> 00:30:10,208
Like, from a distance.

811
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,041
SAM: As a bird?

812
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:11,874
LAURA: You're a bird!

813
00:30:11,874 --> 00:30:12,813
Well, I was gonna say, I can drop,

814
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,788
as soon as he lands, I drop his polymorph,

815
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:15,727
as soon as he lands.

816
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:16,741
LAURA: Well, but I was--

817
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:18,121
waiting for a--

818
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:18,995
Well, he's on the roof.

819
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:20,643
He's on the wall.

820
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:22,010
Well, first, I'm gonna determine

821
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,006
how much damage they took.

822
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,488
(laughing)

823
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:25,675
MARISHA: All of it?

824
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,632
SAM: We are the best at planning.

825
00:30:27,632 --> 00:30:28,632
MATT: That is...

826
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:32,414
MATT: That is...

827
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:36,025
MATT: 83 damage to them.

828
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:37,225
SAM: 83?

829
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,266
That's pretty good!

830
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:39,275
(laughing)

831
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:41,646
MATT: And if I look at the sheets here.

832
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:42,781
TRAVIS: That means toast for
any of us.

833
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:44,136
SAM: And they're prone.

834
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:45,051
(laughing)

835
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,178
ASHLEY: We would be dead.

836
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,011
LIAM: That's me.

837
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,598
Now, you hear a horrible scream

838
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,443
and a crunch sound as they all,

839
00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:53,026
those that fell are unconscious

840
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:55,221
or currently completely unable--

841
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,054
TRAVIS: Yes!

842
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:59,449
We did something right!

843
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:02,506
Low moans of pain barely
echoing up from underneath

844
00:31:02,506 --> 00:31:03,948
as the other ones, like,

845
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:05,570
they grab the arms of the ones 
that are hanging over--

846
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,595
Are they clustered?

847
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:07,566
They're clustered in, yeah.

848
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:08,399
Ah!

849
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,485
I want to take two--

850
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:10,902
I'm taking two...

851
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,193
Where's my English?

852
00:31:14,193 --> 00:31:16,026
Trick shot push shots.

853
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:18,483
Okay, go for it.

854
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:20,064
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Go for it.

855
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,061
Push shot number one.

856
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:22,660
SAM: (mimics shooting)

857
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,743
Uh, that's...

858
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,666
That's with retort, I'm not using the big gun.

859
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:27,933
18, 19...

860
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,129
21?

861
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:30,578
21 hits.

862
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,884
And then they, every time
they hit, they take damage,

863
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:34,217
and they also...

864
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,365
Yeah, they don't even have a save.

865
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,198
MATT: Nope, just pushes them.

866
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,281
Okay, that's, and then that does...

867
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,723
14 points of damage.

868
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:48,556
MATT: Okay.

869
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:49,389
For the one.

870
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:52,751
Which then, that one gets
pushed over the side,

871
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,592
does not make its save
to try to catch the edge,

872
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:56,842
plummets down, suffering...

873
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:01,581
Just 'cause it's fun to check...

874
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:03,217
70 points of damage.

875
00:32:03,217 --> 00:32:05,826
A sickening smack sound--

876
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:06,715
LAURA: Landing on the other ones.

877
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,030
MATT: Landing on the other ones.

878
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,863
It's awful.

879
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:10,522
Looking down there would
be terrible right now.

880
00:32:10,522 --> 00:32:11,355
TALIESIN: Have some taste.

881
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:12,772
And the next one?

882
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,100
Um, that's 17, 27, 30 to hit.

883
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:18,742
MATT: That hits.

884
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:20,911
Let's go ahead and roll
damage on that one.

885
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,446
Uh, that's...

886
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:24,619
13 points of piercing damage?

887
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:25,929
13 points of piercing damage.

888
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:27,372
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Plus the push.

889
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:28,756
He gets pushed, falls off the edge,

890
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:32,306
catches his arm on the side,
and begins pulling himself up.

891
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:33,646
Now there's four of them
that are currently now

892
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:36,617
about to start climbing
up outside of this,

893
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,472
this collapsed portion of earth,

894
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:39,803
but the earth is still
crumbling beneath them,

895
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:40,636
as they're trying--

896
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:43,050
I cast, I cast Hail of Thorns

897
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,529
and shoot in the cluster of them.

898
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,362
Okay.

899
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,466
Go ahead and make the...

900
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:55,275
The Hail of Thorns, it is--

901
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:56,970
TALIESIN: Does that drop count as a kill?

902
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,777
Do I get a grit point
back for that, or no?

903
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,105
MATT: Uh, yeah, I'll say.

904
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,985
The next time I hit a
creature with a ranged weapon,

905
00:33:02,985 --> 00:33:04,152
I rolled a 27.

906
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:11,311
Yeah, so right now, you're
aiming at them all in the hole.

907
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:12,508
From your perspective, they're gonna

908
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:14,066
have three-quarters cover.

909
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:14,899
So that--

910
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,957
I just need to hit the one
that's closest to the top.

911
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:20,156
Right, what's your total roll on that?

912
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:21,147
27.

913
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:21,980
27?

914
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,359
Yeah, even with the three-quarters
cover, that'll still hit.

915
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,192
Okay.

916
00:33:26,192 --> 00:33:28,631
So go ahead and roll damage on that.

917
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,266
Is everyone still standing, by the way?

918
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,257
No.

919
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:32,750
Both the ones that were
standing got pushed

920
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,885
into the hole by gun blasts from behind.

921
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:39,027
Shoved into the large,
open chasm beneath them.

922
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:40,696
26 damage.

923
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:42,320
MATT: 26 damage?

924
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,805
Casting this at what level?

925
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:44,638
Level three.

926
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:45,645
At level three?

927
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:46,478
Nice.

928
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:48,958
All right.

929
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,039
Each creature within
five feet of it?

930
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,616
Okay, so it's, at five feet,
the hole's a much bigger space,

931
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,145
so it only hits two of them.

932
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:55,978
Okay.

933
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:58,872
I'll fling a dagger at the
last one once you're done.

934
00:33:58,872 --> 00:33:59,752
Okay.

935
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:01,180
So, this is all happening simultaneously.

936
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,884
(mimics battle sounds)

937
00:34:02,884 --> 00:34:03,717
Daggers.

938
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:04,922
(laughing)

939
00:34:04,922 --> 00:34:07,046
So, it blasts two of them,
they both catch themselves--

940
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:07,899
Oh, wait!

941
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,283
That was sneak attack.

942
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,598
MATT: Yes, so you
would actually get to...

943
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:12,431
Add another six?

944
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:13,384
MATT: Yeah.

945
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,425
LAURA: Six!
TRAVIS: Wow.

946
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:17,554
All right, that will make them...

947
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:18,387
Not too happy.

948
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:19,554
And your turn?

949
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:23,103
All right, throwing one dagger.

950
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,311
Okay, and it's advantage in hiding...

951
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,978
And it is 27 to hit.

952
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,058
That hits, even with the cover.

953
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:30,929
And it's...

954
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,330
A sneak attack, and a surprise,
so it's a crit, right?

955
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,023
'Cause I'm hidden underneath shit.

956
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:38,174
'Cause she hid us.

957
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:39,077
LAURA: Hide in plain sight.

958
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,409
Technically...

959
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,129
Yeah, I'll let it happen, 'cause it's
part of the surprise round,

960
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:44,303
we'll say this is all 
happening simultaneously.

961
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:47,687
They fall in, grasp, then
they catch themselves,

962
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:48,931
and then the blade comes out of nowhere.

963
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:51,431
So yeah, I'll let that happen.

964
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,597
18, 19...

965
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:57,655
MARISHA: I know, all the dice.

966
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:00,765
21, 34...

967
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,182
34 turns to 68, plus the bonus is 70, 74.

968
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:10,094
TALIESIN: That's obscene.

969
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:12,377
With that, the blade sinks into

970
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:15,129
the top of the skull of the one.

971
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:16,422
The Goliath's trying to pull himself out.

972
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:19,288
As it hits, his arms just go
limp and he falls backward

973
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:21,277
and disappears beneath the earth.

974
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:24,093
And just in case, I'm using
my bonus action to hide.

975
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:25,845
(laughing)

976
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:27,850
LAURA: Oh shit, I should've done that!

977
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,850
MATT: Go ahead and roll stealth.

978
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,759
TALIESIN: None goth'er than thou.

979
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:33,129
LIAM: 25.

980
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:34,183
MATT: 25?

981
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:35,731
Okay, good enough.

982
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:36,564
All right--

983
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:37,812
Could I do the same thing,
because I forgot to hide,

984
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,687
for my bonus action as well?

985
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:40,520
MATT: Sure.

986
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,353
Okay.

987
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:43,103
Both of them just--

988
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:44,846
(laughing)

989
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:45,679
LAURA: 30.

990
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,043
MATT: 30, okay.

991
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:47,876
You got 10?

992
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:49,341
No, I didn't.

993
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:50,174
Way higher.

994
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:53,623
So as it stands now, there are...

995
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:54,623
I believe...

996
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:58,256
Two more in there that
are currently holding on

997
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,442
to try and find their way up.

998
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:02,567
As this is happening, Keyleth,

999
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,826
you're paying attention,
you hear this high-pitched

1000
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:06,932
(screech).

1001
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,345
You look over your shoulder
just in time to see

1002
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:11,140
a large giant eagle swoop down,

1003
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,380
talons extended towards you,
visible on the top of the wall.

1004
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,862
There's no way I could use my

1005
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:17,489
third shot really quick, is there?

1006
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:20,223
Uh, no, you're too focused
on the thing in front you.

1007
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:22,338
TRAVIS: (singing) Let the eagle soar!

1008
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:23,892
It swoops down and the talon strikes you,

1009
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,229
the talon's pushing you forward,

1010
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:27,625
that is gonna be a...

1011
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,688
20?

1012
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:29,521
Your AC?

1013
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,354
Yeah, that hits.

1014
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,354
All right.

1015
00:36:32,394 --> 00:36:34,971
You suffer nine points of piercing damage

1016
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:37,640
as its claws dig into you and attempt

1017
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,996
to throw you from the top of the wall.

1018
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:41,091
MARISHA: Okay, bring it.

1019
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:45,314
Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw

1020
00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:48,910
to try and grab the
ledge before you plummet.

1021
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,832
That's not great.

1022
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:51,665
Uh, 11.

1023
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,807
Unfortunately, you don't
even know which way is up

1024
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:56,371
as the talons chuck you forth

1025
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:57,618
and you plummet from the top of the wall.

1026
00:36:57,618 --> 00:37:00,487
You fall down a total of 45 feet.

1027
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:01,769
Can I go, like,

1028
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,804
Can I turn back into a raven as I fall?

1029
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:07,056
My other bonus, my other action?

1030
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,648
Yeah.

1031
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:13,371
I'll say go ahead, make a
constitution saving throw

1032
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:14,638
as part of your concentration check,

1033
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,406
just to see if you're
able to focus your mind

1034
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:18,674
in that quick period of time.

1035
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:20,105
Uh, 19.

1036
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,062
19, yeah!

1037
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:21,895
(applause)

1038
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:23,088
As you're spiraling
backwards, seeing the eagle,

1039
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:25,416
you look behind you to the
ground, close your eyes,

1040
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:27,597
swoop upward into the form of a raven.

1041
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:28,540
LAURA: Awesome!

1042
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,373
Great work.

1043
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,383
That was sick.
TALIESIN: Sail!

1044
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:31,234
Sail!

1045
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:33,484
(laughing)

1046
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,587
All right, you guys watch as

1047
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,287
the other two guys stand up, getting out,

1048
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:41,438
(grunts) and look about.

1049
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:42,395
You are now still standing out

1050
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:43,861
in the middle of a thoroughfare,

1051
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,036
you're hiding off behind the...

1052
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:48,036
One of the chunks of rubble and rock

1053
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:51,726
that permeate the outside
of the wall in places.

1054
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:54,111
You guys are still hidden.

1055
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:56,501
MARISHA: Since I'm a raven now, can I do

1056
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,514
a loop back to the center of town

1057
00:37:58,514 --> 00:37:59,956
and see what's going on?

1058
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:00,789
Yep.

1059
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:02,056
So you're heading back
to the center of town,

1060
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,518
it's gonna take you a
little bit to get there.

1061
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:04,351
Yep.

1062
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,848
They get back up to the top.

1063
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,668
They spend most of their
turn getting to that edge,

1064
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:09,558
and taking a few steps away from it,

1065
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:11,486
getting their weapons out and
kind of glaring at each other

1066
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:12,319
and trying to figure out

1067
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,222
what the hell they can do right now

1068
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:16,110
as you start looming towards them.

1069
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,550
I, unarmed, start walking towards them.

1070
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,967
And I say, "Where is Kevdak?"

1071
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,024
MATT: Make a deception check.

1072
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:28,136
SAM: Oh, boy.

1073
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:29,553
Not his strength.

1074
00:38:31,806 --> 00:38:33,160
13.

1075
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,994
13?

1076
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:34,827
Plus...

1077
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:38,202
(laughing)

1078
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:39,035
All right.

1079
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:39,868
As you say that...

1080
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:43,240
One of the two individuals
has pulled their way out.

1081
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,157
Humanoid, kind of a grizzled beard.

1082
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,012
Their eyes kind of go wide, and he

1083
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:52,199
just stands still for a second.

1084
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,700
The other one is a Goliath who,

1085
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,656
as he approaches, you
get a familiarity with,

1086
00:38:56,656 --> 00:38:59,038
you remember this individual.

1087
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:01,083
Little younger than you.

1088
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,852
Has a pretty, pretty heavy scar
from the bottom of the chin

1089
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:05,842
that goes down to about the sternum.

1090
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:08,259
Named by, by the name of Suda

1091
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:10,717
who just kind of steps forward,

1092
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:13,547
gives you a look-over and goes,

1093
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:14,797
"Strongjaw, ha.

1094
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:20,245
"You're a Grog stronger,
that's what you are."

1095
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:22,245
Fool. You know not who I am.

1096
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,093
I have not come through flame and death

1097
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:30,118
to deal with filth like you.

1098
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:33,118
"He's a bleedin' liar."

1099
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:35,585
"Come on, you guys have been had."

1100
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,211
And he goes ahead and
takes the two hand axes,

1101
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,971
he throws them in the air
and kinda catches them.

1102
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:43,392
He goes (grunts) and
rushes in towards you.

1103
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:45,615
However, he's unable to
make anything else this turn

1104
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:48,231
except movement into
face-to-face with Grog.

1105
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:50,136
We'll say, for the purposes
of this open space,

1106
00:39:50,136 --> 00:39:52,969
Grog will be there and this one...

1107
00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:56,501
SAM: Suda.

1108
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,334
TRAVIS: Suda.

1109
00:39:58,537 --> 00:39:59,370
He's gonna...

1110
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,264
Not quite as--

1111
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,097
LAURA: Tiny.

1112
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:02,238
That blade there.

1113
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:03,684
LAURA: He's pathetic.

1114
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:04,695
Look at that loser.

1115
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,897
(laughing)

1116
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:06,730
Kill him, Grog!

1117
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,819
Kill him, Grog!

1118
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:09,265
MATT: Is anybody else doing anything

1119
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:10,439
right now on this turn?

1120
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,091
Or are we just waiting
to see what happens here?

1121
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:13,444
TALIESIN: I'm observing.

1122
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,494
Okay.

1123
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:15,331
So.

1124
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,255
As you're watching and you're
heading off that direction,

1125
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:20,220
Grog, he comes forward, in
your face, what do you do?

1126
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,275
I would like to rage.

1127
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:24,219
(laughing)

1128
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,165
MATT: All right.

1129
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,836
Take out the firebrand warhammer,

1130
00:40:27,836 --> 00:40:29,460
and I'm gonna tattoo his ass.

1131
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,261
(laughing)

1132
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:32,637
Go for it, go ahead and take
your two attacks.

1133
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:35,377
(laughing)

1134
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:37,760
Uh, 16.

1135
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,267
MATT: 16?

1136
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:40,313
Misses.

1137
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,146
No!

1138
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,267
I cast War God's Blessing.

1139
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,458
(gasps)

1140
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,657
As Pike steps out from
the high grass, in this--

1141
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:47,823
ASHLEY: What up, motherfucker?

1142
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:48,991
Oh!

1143
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,192
(laughing)

1144
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:51,323
MARISHA: Pike is back!

1145
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:55,163
With that, the little bit of
noise distraction outside,

1146
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:57,461
turns his face, his eyes
peeking out the corner of

1147
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:01,394
the eye sockets, and that's
just the little moment

1148
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:03,657
of opportunity you need to go ahead

1149
00:41:03,657 --> 00:41:06,711
and double up and slam upward
with the butt of the hammer.

1150
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:09,878
Go ahead, roll damage for that attack.

1151
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,970
TRAVIS: Oh God, it's been so
long since I used the...

1152
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:20,351
(laughing)

1153
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:21,862
Uh, that's 17.

1154
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,877
MATT: 17 damage, got it.

1155
00:41:23,877 --> 00:41:24,710
Second attack?

1156
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,596
Second attack

1157
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:27,429
is 24.

1158
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:30,131
That hits, roll damage
on that one as well.

1159
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:32,063
LIAM: Hey, where'd the grizzly guy go?

1160
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,758
The grizzly guy's just
stepping back a little bit.

1161
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,711
Or like, he's like taking
one step onto his back foot,

1162
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:37,276
not even approaching Grog.

1163
00:41:37,276 --> 00:41:38,965
Where's the eagles?

1164
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:41,557
The eagles aren't too far
from your side right now.

1165
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:43,732
SAM: And where's the pit?

1166
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:47,221
The pit is about 10 feet
behind the guy who's standing,

1167
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,803
actually, I should probably
put him there right now.

1168
00:41:49,803 --> 00:41:50,636
TALIESIN: Also, I'd like to keep

1169
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:52,020
an eye out for the eagles as well.

1170
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,391
MATT: He's about there.

1171
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:54,616
LIAM: And where's the chasm?

1172
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,801
LAURA: He's putting it
down, he's putting it down.

1173
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:57,880
LIAM: All right!

1174
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,594
MATT: I'm doing this, I'm
drawing it out for you guys.

1175
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:00,877
Come on, invent a battle
map, just like that, Matt!

1176
00:42:00,877 --> 00:42:02,505
Come on!

1177
00:42:02,505 --> 00:42:04,755
(laughing)

1178
00:42:06,432 --> 00:42:09,432
(adventurous music)

1179
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:16,834
TALIESIN: That is a really good chasm.

1180
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:17,897
LAURA: That is a huge chasm!

1181
00:42:17,897 --> 00:42:21,964
We're watching his magic in real life.

1182
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:24,226
Where's all the dead
bodies at the bottom of it?

1183
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:25,729
Yeah, can you draw detailed dead bodies?

1184
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:26,743
(laughing)

1185
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:27,701
Can you just grade it a little bit?

1186
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:29,534
MATT: Oh, I'm dead!

1187
00:42:33,188 --> 00:42:35,400
SAM: Do you like to draw,
or sketch, or just doodle?

1188
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,994
LIAM: Where are the twins right now?

1189
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,745
Twins would be back here.

1190
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:40,572
LAURA: Hiding.

1191
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:43,068
Pike would be off to the side here.

1192
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:44,106
TALIESIN: Way off in the middle of fuck-all.

1193
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,981
Percy's like (babbling)

1194
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:46,814
TALIESIN: I'm gonna keep an eye out

1195
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,247
for the eagles, too, so...

1196
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:49,080
MATT: Okay.

1197
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,590
Everybody keep commenting
if you see something--

1198
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,423
Where's the eagles?

1199
00:42:51,423 --> 00:42:52,724
TRAVIS: So the last attack was 18,

1200
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:55,253
plus 2 points of the fire damage, for 20.

1201
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:56,877
For 20, nice.

1202
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:57,717
TRAVIS: The second attack.

1203
00:42:57,717 --> 00:42:58,784
Okay.

1204
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,171
So that ends your turn.

1205
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,593
He's gonna go ahead and go for

1206
00:43:01,593 --> 00:43:03,660
a round of retaliation against you,

1207
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,975
using the action surge
that was afforded by it,

1208
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:10,768
gonna make 4 attacks on you.

1209
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:13,685
That is a really, really shitty 16.

1210
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:15,657
TRAVIS: Misses.

1211
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:16,568
Misses.

1212
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:17,651
That is a 24.

1213
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:19,941
TRAVIS: Hits.

1214
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:21,023
MATT: That is 25.

1215
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:21,856
Hits.

1216
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:23,048
MATT: And a 22.

1217
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:23,881
That also hits.

1218
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:26,083
So three hits on you.

1219
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,694
LAURA: He's strong!

1220
00:43:27,694 --> 00:43:30,220
MARISHA: How does he get four attacks?

1221
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,299
Is he a fighter?

1222
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:32,132
TALIESIN: Action surge.

1223
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:32,965
Oh, action surge?

1224
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:33,901
(groans)

1225
00:43:33,901 --> 00:43:38,121
So this would be 11
points of slashing damage,

1226
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:39,371
reduced to six.

1227
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:42,765
Or five, actually, for you.

1228
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:44,303
That is...

1229
00:43:44,303 --> 00:43:46,653
14 points slashing damage reduced to 7.

1230
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:47,572
Okay.

1231
00:43:47,572 --> 00:43:50,448
MATT: And 9 reduced to 4.

1232
00:43:50,448 --> 00:43:51,281
Okay.

1233
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:53,112
He just hacks into you

1234
00:43:53,112 --> 00:43:55,195
(grunts)

1235
00:43:56,815 --> 00:43:57,683
and looks forward and sees you

1236
00:43:57,683 --> 00:44:00,567
barely moved by this flurry.

1237
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:02,673
TRAVIS: Oh tiny dancer, you are fucked.

1238
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,050
(laughing)

1239
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,096
MATT: Anyone else jumping in on this?

1240
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:07,065
Yeah, can I do a thing?

1241
00:44:07,065 --> 00:44:10,117
I want to stealth and creep
over to where Pike is.

1242
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:11,173
MATT: Okay.

1243
00:44:11,173 --> 00:44:13,087
You've been stealth, but yeah--

1244
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:14,681
LIAM: And I would like to hold my action

1245
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:18,213
and if the Goliath's buddy does anything,

1246
00:44:18,213 --> 00:44:19,941
if he tries to help or if he tries to run,

1247
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:21,844
I'm still hidden, right?

1248
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:22,677
Yeah.

1249
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:24,071
Yeah, so I'm gonna fucking throw a knife

1250
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:25,170
at him if he does anything.

1251
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,168
MATT: Okay.

1252
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:27,705
I'm gonna cast Hunter's
Mark on the guy behind.

1253
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:29,555
MATT: Okay, got it.

1254
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:30,388
Keep one alive,

1255
00:44:30,388 --> 00:44:32,302
I want to know where
our two principals are.

1256
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,135
Okay.

1257
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:35,499
TALIESIN: "Keep one alive."

1258
00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:36,332
MATT: All right.

1259
00:44:36,332 --> 00:44:38,639
Hunter's Mark on that fellow there.

1260
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,088
TALIESIN: And keeping an eye on the hawks.

1261
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:41,934
MATT: Okay.

1262
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:42,947
SAM: Eagle.

1263
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,718
You need one over there.

1264
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:46,141
Grog, your round of retribution is up.

1265
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,705
Pike, you wanna do anything?

1266
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:48,538
Uh...

1267
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:52,581
No, I'm gonna hold.

1268
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:54,032
MATT: Okay.

1269
00:44:54,032 --> 00:44:55,831
Oh, it's my turn again?

1270
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:56,664
MATT: Yep.

1271
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:57,497
Yep.

1272
00:44:57,497 --> 00:45:01,047
More tattoos for twiddly-fuck, Suda.

1273
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:01,880
Wait.

1274
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,387
No.

1275
00:45:04,387 --> 00:45:07,735
I want to bullrush Suda and
drive him back towards...

1276
00:45:07,735 --> 00:45:08,652
MARISHA: Yes, yes!

1277
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:09,765
TRAVIS: The pit.

1278
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:12,404
LAURA: Yeah! Pit of despair!

1279
00:45:12,404 --> 00:45:14,127
SAM: That is the correct answer.

1280
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:15,088
(laughing)

1281
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,403
LAURA: The pit of despair.

1282
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:17,236
Haven't bullrushed in a while, okay.

1283
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:19,702
Make sure, I forgot that was proper.

1284
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:23,202
(jumbled excited chatter)

1285
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:25,010
TRAVIS: It might be, I think

1286
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,571
it's like 30 feet, I can't remember.

1287
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:28,961
Or maybe it's 20, I can't remember.

1288
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:32,414
It's a little less than that, we'll see.

1289
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:33,247
TRAVIS: Oh, is it?

1290
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:34,102
We'll see.

1291
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:35,956
At least you made it interesting.

1292
00:45:35,956 --> 00:45:38,439
So shoving a creature, you can...

1293
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:39,356
Shove it...

1294
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:43,264
LAURA: 9700 feet, specifically.

1295
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:45,597
All of them, all the feet.

1296
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:48,625
SAM: Yeah, I mean, maybe it's 15 feet,

1297
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,311
but he doesn't know numbers, so...

1298
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:51,144
It's strength.

1299
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:52,522
Okay, it's strength athletics check

1300
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:55,248
contested by his athletics
or acrobatics.

1301
00:45:55,248 --> 00:45:58,100
You push him five feet
away from you, or prone.

1302
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,933
MARISHA: Five feet?

1303
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:01,828
LAURA: Or prone, prone is good.

1304
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:02,958
ASHLEY: Prone, and then you could--

1305
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,196
TRAVIS: Drag him.
ASHLEY: Drag him.

1306
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:06,343
MATT: You could try and shove him out,

1307
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:08,514
you could grapple and
try to drag him with you.

1308
00:46:08,514 --> 00:46:09,627
TRAVIS: I'd like to do that.

1309
00:46:09,627 --> 00:46:10,486
MATT: Okay.

1310
00:46:10,486 --> 00:46:11,319
(laughing)

1311
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:12,152
so go ahead and make an--

1312
00:46:12,152 --> 00:46:12,985
Athletics check?

1313
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:15,758
Athletics check, yeah.

1314
00:46:15,758 --> 00:46:17,112
MATT: That's when I roll a natural one.

1315
00:46:17,112 --> 00:46:17,945
That would be when I do it.

1316
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:18,778
Brilliant.

1317
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:20,146
MATT: Of course.

1318
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:21,502
'Cause that was a 12.

1319
00:46:21,502 --> 00:46:22,351
MATT: Okay.

1320
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:25,426
And with that, you bring the
hammer back, like you're gonna

1321
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:26,811
go ahead and slam it into his face,

1322
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:27,890
and instead you reach down by

1323
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:32,683
underneath the ankle, and you
just flip him onto his back.

1324
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:34,824
As he's there, slammed onto the ground,

1325
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:36,896
the hard, kind of packed
dirt of the roadway

1326
00:46:36,896 --> 00:46:38,619
that leads into the
western side of Westruun,

1327
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:40,779
are you gonna attempt to
go for a grapple, then?

1328
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:41,612
Yes.

1329
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:42,830
MATT: All righty.

1330
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,469
As he is on the ground, I will go ahead

1331
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,192
and allow advantage on this attempt.

1332
00:46:48,192 --> 00:46:50,377
So for your second strike on this,

1333
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:55,054
roll another athletics
check, with an advantage.

1334
00:46:55,054 --> 00:46:57,337
Because he is on the ground.

1335
00:46:57,337 --> 00:46:58,963
27.

1336
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:00,157
MATT: Yeah, no, you got him.

1337
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:01,677
(laughing)

1338
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:02,510
ASHLEY: Bye-bye!

1339
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:06,299
MATT: So you can drag him
at half your movement speed.

1340
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:07,382
So 25 feet?

1341
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,350
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes.

1342
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,183
Oh my god.

1343
00:47:11,183 --> 00:47:12,147
Let's count.

1344
00:47:12,147 --> 00:47:13,873
Let's count!

1345
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:17,166
MATT: So that's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

1346
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,176
(cheering)

1347
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:20,009
LAURA: Kick him, kick him!

1348
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:20,842
SAM: Oh, the tension and the drama!

1349
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:23,396
TALIESIN: You can let him
stand before the chasm.

1350
00:47:23,396 --> 00:47:24,229
Just...

1351
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:26,037
MATT: Especially dragging him through--

1352
00:47:26,037 --> 00:47:27,247
LIAM: This!

1353
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:28,197
Is!

1354
00:47:28,197 --> 00:47:29,571
Westruun!
TRAVIS: Don't say it!

1355
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:30,716
(laughing)

1356
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:31,549
MATT: The other guy next to him,

1357
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:33,123
holding the hand axe,
is watching you drag him off

1358
00:47:33,123 --> 00:47:34,106
and he's just like...

1359
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:35,076
(grunts)

1360
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:36,715
and unleashes a--

1361
00:47:36,715 --> 00:47:37,836
MARISHA: Fucking asshole.

1362
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:38,813
LAURA: No!

1363
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,296
MARISHA: Yeah, go go go!

1364
00:47:40,296 --> 00:47:42,279
LIAM: I call it, I go for it, and I'm hidden.

1365
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:44,732
I have advantage and all that shit.

1366
00:47:44,732 --> 00:47:45,565
Oh!

1367
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:47,815
(laughing)

1368
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:51,033
LIAM: 28, 29...
LAURA: 29.

1369
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,205
MATT: 29 hits.

1370
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:53,038
29, yep.

1371
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,685
Okay, good one.

1372
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:56,326
LAURA: Oh my god, those are so many!

1373
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:58,176
5, 10, 15...

1374
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:00,300
ASHLEY: I'm gonna cast Sanctuary on Grog.

1375
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,515
LIAM: 25, 25 doubled is 50.
LAURA: 50!

1376
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:04,974
56, 56.

1377
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:05,807
SAM: 56?

1378
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:08,182
MATT: And the bonus action?

1379
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:10,217
56, and I would like to use
my bonus action to hide.

1380
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:11,344
(laughing)

1381
00:48:11,344 --> 00:48:12,177
MATT: All right...

1382
00:48:12,177 --> 00:48:13,704
Okay, yeah.

1383
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:16,144
Usually, your bonus action, you've already

1384
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,628
used your turn to hold your action.

1385
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:18,461
LIAM: Okay.

1386
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:19,294
In theory.

1387
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:20,200
Whatever you want, whatever you want.

1388
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,338
MATT: I'll say you're
not hidden right now.

1389
00:48:21,338 --> 00:48:22,433
Usually it's, you have to...

1390
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,112
The bonus action is used on your turn,

1391
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:25,511
and the holding your action is kind of

1392
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,041
that one thing that keeps over, so...

1393
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:27,874
LIAM: Love it.

1394
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:30,472
MATT: But as he goes
forward, the dagger

1395
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:33,681
sinks right into his
sternum and he kind of...

1396
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:34,889
(grunts)

1397
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:37,798
and, still using his
momentum, goes forward.

1398
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:38,878
As you're dragging it, it's gonna go

1399
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:40,759
two strikes against you.

1400
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:41,592
Uh...

1401
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:44,617
13.

1402
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:45,450
TRAVIS: Misses.

1403
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,484
MATT: And 15.

1404
00:48:46,484 --> 00:48:47,484
Misses.

1405
00:48:47,484 --> 00:48:49,530
Just both axes do strike and hit you,

1406
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,736
but one of them hits the shoulder armor

1407
00:48:51,736 --> 00:48:53,985
on the back of your shoulder,

1408
00:48:53,985 --> 00:48:55,237
kind of cracks part of the bone

1409
00:48:55,237 --> 00:48:56,679
and just streaks off the metal.

1410
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:57,987
The other one comes down and hits you

1411
00:48:57,987 --> 00:49:00,009
in the back of the Belt of Dwarvenkind.

1412
00:49:00,009 --> 00:49:01,982
You feel a little sink of pain

1413
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,318
as it kind of cuts through
some of the leather,

1414
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:05,921
but even the belt itself
deflects most of the attack.

1415
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:06,754
TRAVIS: I look over and say,

1416
00:49:06,754 --> 00:49:08,796
"Sit down, son, before you hurt yourself."

1417
00:49:08,796 --> 00:49:11,292
(laughing)

1418
00:49:11,292 --> 00:49:12,125
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1419
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:12,958
(laughing)

1420
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,041
LAURA: Oh.

1421
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,244
TRAVIS: It's a 1.

1422
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,893
(laughing)

1423
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:18,750
MATT: He rolled a 20, so, yeah.

1424
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,685
(laughing)

1425
00:49:20,685 --> 00:49:22,149
He'd have a really witty comeback

1426
00:49:22,149 --> 00:49:24,767
if he didn't have a dagger
in his sternum at the moment.

1427
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:25,600
MATT: Yeah.

1428
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,210
(laughing)

1429
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,470
He's a little distracted at the moment.

1430
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,466
All right, so, that being said,

1431
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:33,429
the guy who's on the ground now--

1432
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,434
any of you guys wanna do
anything at this point?

1433
00:49:36,434 --> 00:49:39,173
I'll shoot an arrow at the
other guy standing there.

1434
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:40,006
LIAM: Finish him off.

1435
00:49:40,006 --> 00:49:43,296
MARISHA: Am I back to town yet?

1436
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:44,267
MATT: Not yet.

1437
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,047
This is--

1438
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:46,343
MARISHA: It takes a while.

1439
00:49:46,343 --> 00:49:47,873
23?

1440
00:49:47,873 --> 00:49:49,018
MATT: 23 it is.

1441
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:51,766
Roll damage, with Hunter's Mark.

1442
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:54,334
Hunter's Mark and sneak attack.

1443
00:49:54,334 --> 00:49:55,427
MATT: Yes, because he cannot see you.

1444
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:56,427
He's unaware of your presence.

1445
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,536
TALIESIN: God, we're mean.

1446
00:49:58,536 --> 00:49:59,801
LIAM: Efficient.

1447
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:01,594
TALIESIN: Efficient.

1448
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:02,774
21.

1449
00:50:02,774 --> 00:50:03,607
MATT: All righty.

1450
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:04,694
That's the first arrow.

1451
00:50:04,694 --> 00:50:06,527
MATT: All right.

1452
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:09,677
Oh, that was so close!

1453
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:10,867
14.

1454
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:12,194
14.

1455
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:13,027
It misses.

1456
00:50:13,027 --> 00:50:13,860
It's okay, though,

1457
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,034
I was going to let you
roll the second anyway.

1458
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:18,334
21, the arrow strikes him
right through the throat,

1459
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:21,216
and he just (gurgles and chokes)

1460
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:22,596
and grasps for his throat, gurgling

1461
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:24,866
before he falls to his knees and

1462
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:27,230
slumps into the ground, head to the side,

1463
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,419
kind of still clutching
at it as he slowly,

1464
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:30,321
the life spills out of him.

1465
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,069
(laughing)

1466
00:50:33,069 --> 00:50:35,300
LIAM: He died as he
lived, deeply unimpressed.

1467
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,550
(laughing)

1468
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:41,581
The other guy gets up, though,

1469
00:50:42,732 --> 00:50:46,018
and he's going to use action
trying to break the grapple.

1470
00:50:46,018 --> 00:50:47,009
That is going to be a--

1471
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:48,160
LAURA: Fail!

1472
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,040
Come on, Grog.

1473
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,207
Come on, Grog!

1474
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:52,989
16.

1475
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:53,822
TRAVIS: Misses.

1476
00:50:53,822 --> 00:50:55,115
(laughing)

1477
00:50:55,115 --> 00:50:56,360
It's contested with your athletics.

1478
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,193
Oh.

1479
00:50:57,193 --> 00:50:58,358
And I have to roll an athletics check?

1480
00:50:58,358 --> 00:50:59,191
MATT: Yeah.

1481
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:02,102
You are raging, so technically
you have advantage on it.

1482
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:04,284
That's pretty good.

1483
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:05,468
I'll take the 18.

1484
00:51:05,468 --> 00:51:07,256
Athletics 26.

1485
00:51:07,256 --> 00:51:09,667
Yeah, he's still grappling,
you can't do anything on that.

1486
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:10,957
It's your turn.
TALIESIN: He's wriggling!

1487
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:12,404
It's my turn?

1488
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:15,169
Well, I look to him and I say,

1489
00:51:15,169 --> 00:51:18,746
"I will let you fly from here
if you answer this question.

1490
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:21,579
"Is Kevdak or Zanror in the city?"

1491
00:51:24,572 --> 00:51:25,815
Make a persuasion check.

1492
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:26,648
No, this would be intimidation.

1493
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:28,351
Intimidation, not persuasion.

1494
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,629
This is how Goliaths prom dance.

1495
00:51:31,629 --> 00:51:32,462
Uh, 8.

1496
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,722
MATT: 8?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1497
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:37,528
(laughing)

1498
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,405
Okay, as you're holding
him there, he goes,

1499
00:51:40,405 --> 00:51:42,183
"You'll find out, won't you?"

1500
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:45,480
I take his neck and I smash
my head into his nose.

1501
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,809
It just breaks and crumbles,

1502
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,574
his face is partially caved in,

1503
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,452
and you can see blood just running

1504
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:54,226
rapidly out of his nostrils
where his bones were.

1505
00:51:54,226 --> 00:51:57,356
"You won't be there to watch my discovery.

1506
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:59,273
"Are they in the city?"

1507
00:52:01,313 --> 00:52:03,822
"Yeah, they're waiting for you."

1508
00:52:03,822 --> 00:52:06,092
"Good, I'll let you fly now."

1509
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:07,489
And I kick him into the pit.

1510
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:08,322
(laughing)

1511
00:52:08,322 --> 00:52:09,572
MARISHA: Whee!

1512
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,353
All right, I'll say as you use

1513
00:52:12,353 --> 00:52:13,895
your movement to push forward,

1514
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:17,228
go ahead and make your athletics check.

1515
00:52:17,228 --> 00:52:18,061
18.

1516
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,960
And with that, he--

1517
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,300
(mimics fight sounds)

1518
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,935
Reaching out, grasps, catches the

1519
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:27,864
very edge of the ledge behind him,

1520
00:52:27,864 --> 00:52:29,301
and the rock just breaks.

1521
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:31,356
(laughing)

1522
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,871
"No!"

1523
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:34,620
He vanishes, screaming, into the pit below

1524
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,021
as you step forward and look over.

1525
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:40,628
What little glint of daylight
even makes the bottom area,

1526
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:42,195
'cause it's far out of
your range for dark vision,

1527
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:45,929
you just see enough of a
movement on the bottom,

1528
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,938
and then no movement whatsoever.

1529
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:49,318
TALIESIN: You Wile E. Coyote'd that guy!

1530
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:50,151
Oh, man.

1531
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:52,210
GROG: You all right down there?

1532
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,500
(laughing)

1533
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
No answer.

1534
00:52:57,336 --> 00:52:58,199
Yay!

1535
00:52:58,199 --> 00:52:59,032
Yay!

1536
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:01,086
LIAM: And scene.

1537
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:02,055
You've made it--

1538
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,997
I'm looking for Scanlan, too, by the way.

1539
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:04,830
Kind of keeping an eye out for Scanlan.

1540
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,413
Perception check.

1541
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:09,661
Uh, 23.

1542
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:11,971
23, okay.

1543
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:14,606
The second time.

1544
00:53:14,606 --> 00:53:19,185
As you're glancing through,
you see no sign of Scanlan.

1545
00:53:19,185 --> 00:53:21,018
You do see now that...

1546
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:27,139
There are small groups
of these clan individuals

1547
00:53:29,563 --> 00:53:33,730
are now pulling out of homes
various denizens of Westruun

1548
00:53:36,676 --> 00:53:39,629
and pulling them towards
the center of town.

1549
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:41,272
They're screaming and kicking, you know,

1550
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:42,365
or some of them just
aren't putting up a fight

1551
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:43,622
because they have no way to,

1552
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:45,833
and they're just pulling
them, almost like shields,

1553
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:47,666
to the center of town.

1554
00:53:48,701 --> 00:53:51,119
It seems like they...

1555
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,412
MARISHA: Have a plan.
MATT: Have a plan.

1556
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:53,912
TALIESIN: Shit.

1557
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:57,383
I don't know that.

1558
00:53:57,383 --> 00:53:58,883
I haul ass back.

1559
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,090
Heading back.

1560
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,784
Do I see them, do I see the group?

1561
00:54:03,784 --> 00:54:06,685
We've cleared the area,
more or less, yeah?

1562
00:54:06,685 --> 00:54:08,823
MATT: I mean, the area where they
are, as you glance back?

1563
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:11,672
Yeah, there doesn't appear
to be any current set.

1564
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:13,010
Whoever was set to go to that side

1565
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,186
of the gate to check it out--

1566
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:15,019
MARISHA: Has been hit?

1567
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:15,852
Has not returned.

1568
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:16,860
MARISHA: Sure.

1569
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,360
Can I turn back into a crow,

1570
00:54:20,278 --> 00:54:21,744
or do you need, do I need to--

1571
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:23,522
I have to cast that on you.

1572
00:54:23,522 --> 00:54:25,937
But it's new casting, it's
not just the same casting?

1573
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:27,970
MARISHA: Correct.
TALIESIN: Okay, good.

1574
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:28,803
I can't drop it in and out.

1575
00:54:28,803 --> 00:54:29,636
MATT: So you're heading back?

1576
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:30,469
I head back.

1577
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:31,302
Okay.

1578
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:32,135
Scanlan.

1579
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,119
Oh, me?

1580
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,545
MATT: Yes. So--
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

1581
00:54:34,545 --> 00:54:36,270
As some time has passed,
you guys have waited it out.

1582
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,154
MARISHA: I'm looking for Scanlan

1583
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:39,290
on my way back, by the way.

1584
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,123
Yeah.

1585
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:43,005
You are currently hunkered down with

1586
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:47,172
Kaylee, Dr. Dranzel, and this
cluster of nine survivors.

1587
00:54:48,512 --> 00:54:51,726
You've managed to parry off one incursion

1588
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:55,283
of these herd members within the temple.

1589
00:54:55,283 --> 00:54:57,706
The barricaded door is
still slightly ajar,

1590
00:54:57,706 --> 00:54:59,702
as closing it would make
quite a bit of noise.

1591
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:00,535
SAM: Mm-hmm.

1592
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:01,936
What are you planning to do?

1593
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:03,644
(sighs)

1594
00:55:03,644 --> 00:55:04,477
I mean, I have to get these people

1595
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:06,560
out of the city, I guess.

1596
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:12,062
So, they know the location of the

1597
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:14,947
entrance to the sewers, correct?

1598
00:55:14,947 --> 00:55:16,773
Kaylee had said that she knew, yeah.

1599
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:20,232
All right, well then, I'm just going to...

1600
00:55:20,232 --> 00:55:21,065
Shit.

1601
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:22,630
Do I know that the Goliaths were

1602
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:25,213
working with orcs at all, or...

1603
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,000
Was it just Goliaths, is it--

1604
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,833
Well, no.

1605
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,399
From what you've heard from when...

1606
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:34,616
When Grog was interrogating
the first member

1607
00:55:34,616 --> 00:55:36,289
of the herd that you guys found

1608
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:39,588
on your way south
through Westruun, there--

1609
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:42,466
it was a largely Goliath herd that had

1610
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:46,549
been challenged by and
then defeated another clan

1611
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,740
and then absorbed them, and the other clan

1612
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,468
involved a lot more varying
races and specialities.

1613
00:55:53,468 --> 00:55:55,074
There were half-orcs, there were some

1614
00:55:55,074 --> 00:55:57,037
kind of wild elves that
were part of the crew,

1615
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:59,040
and a lot of the brigand humans.

1616
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,561
It was very much kind of like just--

1617
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:03,978
defeated their leader, took in the others

1618
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:07,155
because their choice was
to either die or join.

1619
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:07,988
SAM: Mm-hmm.

1620
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:09,756
And as such, it has
grown to this much more

1621
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:12,660
mammoth-sized roving herd.

1622
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,737
I don't remember the name of
that herd or anything, right?

1623
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:15,980
Or what they looked like.

1624
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,813
But they were motley,

1625
00:56:16,813 --> 00:56:19,123
and they involved half-orcs and things.

1626
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:20,188
MATT: There were a couple half-orcs,

1627
00:56:20,188 --> 00:56:21,722
there were a few humans that were, like,

1628
00:56:21,722 --> 00:56:24,482
I think you saw one wild elf,
and then mostly Goliaths,

1629
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:27,033
based around the center
of the Margraves estate.

1630
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,392
Okay.

1631
00:56:28,392 --> 00:56:29,966
All right.

1632
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:30,799
Uh, well, we're,

1633
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,762
I tell the people, there's
nine people, right?

1634
00:56:32,762 --> 00:56:33,762
MATT: Yeah.

1635
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:34,805
Plus Me, Kaylee and Doctor?

1636
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:39,454
Uh, all right, well, I gather
the people around and I say,

1637
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:43,377
"We're going to be moving
through the city rather fast.

1638
00:56:43,377 --> 00:56:46,266
"In case we are spotted, I need to

1639
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:47,948
"hide you people, or make you not

1640
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:51,531
"a target, so I'm going
to disguise you all

1641
00:56:53,908 --> 00:56:56,658
"as a band of irritable half-orcs

1642
00:56:58,152 --> 00:57:02,235
"and grotesque humans and
the like using Seeming.

1643
00:57:05,077 --> 00:57:06,986
"And just look ornery, and look mean,

1644
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:10,030
"and if you are approached, just sort of

1645
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,313
"spit and kick the dirt and look pissy.

1646
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:14,162
"We'll go."

1647
00:57:14,162 --> 00:57:16,337
Make a performance check.

1648
00:57:16,337 --> 00:57:17,170
A performance check?

1649
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,675
In showing them and guiding them--

1650
00:57:19,675 --> 00:57:22,312
Oh, I can demonstrate it for them.

1651
00:57:22,312 --> 00:57:24,698
Yes, with my acting abilities.

1652
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:25,612
(laughing)

1653
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:26,920
Okay, I'm such a good performer.

1654
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,919
I'm not even gonna look.

1655
00:57:28,919 --> 00:57:30,236
Taliesin, what did I roll?

1656
00:57:30,236 --> 00:57:33,069
Um, well, uh, you're doing okay.

1657
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:35,274
It's okay, you--

1658
00:57:35,274 --> 00:57:37,978
with your performance bonus, that's a 20.

1659
00:57:37,978 --> 00:57:38,811
Okay, good.

1660
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:40,310
(laughing)

1661
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,508
You take a moment to show, like,

1662
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:44,071
some guttural snarls, teach a few odd,

1663
00:57:44,071 --> 00:57:46,245
you know, curse words in orcish

1664
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:48,050
that you learned through your travels.

1665
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,606
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just
some vocal warm-ups,

1666
00:57:49,606 --> 00:57:51,253
you know, when you wanna get deep,

1667
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:53,956
(growls) everyone try.

1668
00:57:53,956 --> 00:57:55,750
(growls)

1669
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,835
That's good, that's good, that's good.

1670
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:58,474
Work on that.

1671
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:01,981
You all gather up, along
with Dranzel and Kaylee,

1672
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:04,427
who looks kind of suspicious
at what you're attempting,

1673
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:07,003
she's like, "What exactly
are you trying to do here?"

1674
00:58:07,003 --> 00:58:08,319
I'm just trying to keep us safe

1675
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,108
and get these people to the sewers.

1676
00:58:10,108 --> 00:58:12,807
You know the way out
of the city, don't you?

1677
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:13,727
"Aye, I can show you."

1678
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:14,560
All right.

1679
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,521
Do you have weapons, can
you protect yourself?

1680
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:19,551
Are you okay?

1681
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:21,395
"I can protect myself.

1682
00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:23,899
"Don't worry, Scanlan."

1683
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:27,584
I'm just worried, I
have to worry about you,

1684
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,902
I will always be worried about you.

1685
00:58:29,902 --> 00:58:30,748
I'm sorry.

1686
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:31,835
"You'll always be disappointed to find

1687
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:34,389
"that I can take care of myself."

1688
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,132
No, I won't be disappointed at all.

1689
00:58:36,132 --> 00:58:38,242
In fact, that makes me quite happy.

1690
00:58:38,242 --> 00:58:39,716
"Good, can we be off then?"

1691
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,126
Well, all right.

1692
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:43,922
Okay, as long as you're happy, I'm happy.

1693
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:45,258
"All right."

1694
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:46,488
Listen, I'm sorry, it's just--

1695
00:58:46,488 --> 00:58:48,150
(laughing)

1696
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,148
I never get to see you, and

1697
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:52,550
I know we're in a rush
here and everything.

1698
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:56,164
You can't, listen, you can't hate away

1699
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:58,058
me being your father, all right?

1700
00:58:58,058 --> 00:58:59,872
I will always be the guy, no matter

1701
00:58:59,872 --> 00:59:02,021
how much you curse my name and wish I was

1702
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:05,472
not part of you, my
blood is inside of you--

1703
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:06,305
LAURA: Ew.

1704
00:59:06,305 --> 00:59:07,850
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, people,

1705
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:10,099
but, you know, I care about you.

1706
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:10,932
All right?

1707
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:15,626
"All right, it's not going to stop me from

1708
00:59:15,626 --> 00:59:18,327
"trying to hate you away, but...

1709
00:59:18,327 --> 00:59:19,683
"I get what you're saying.

1710
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:21,300
"Well, do your trick."

1711
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,133
Okay.

1712
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:23,845
So I cast Seeming on the lot, and

1713
00:59:23,845 --> 00:59:26,110
I make a few orcs and a few humans.

1714
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:28,645
Any number of creatures
within 30 feet of you.

1715
00:59:28,645 --> 00:59:31,895
So, all of these Westruun peasant folk,

1716
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:36,695
yourself, Dr. Dranzel, and Kaylee

1717
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:40,862
all of a sudden become,
to varying sized degrees--

1718
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:44,930
I can make people a foot taller.

1719
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,271
Taller, yeah, so like, they
can be somewhat larger.

1720
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:48,421
You're still--

1721
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:51,680
You guys are still tiny
little goblinoid half-orcs

1722
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,449
but it gives a visual perspective,

1723
00:59:53,449 --> 00:59:54,886
based on what you've seen of this troop,

1724
00:59:54,886 --> 00:59:56,293
and everyone kind of looks at themselves,

1725
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:57,744
looking at the back of their hands.

1726
00:59:57,744 --> 00:59:59,626
There's this one kind of younger man

1727
00:59:59,626 --> 01:00:03,187
in his mid-teens, he's
like, "This is amazing!"

1728
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:04,020
(grunts)

1729
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,373
And they're also making
the noises at each other,

1730
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:07,860
like for a brief moment, all of the fear

1731
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,382
subsides as they're, for the moment,

1732
01:00:09,382 --> 01:00:11,342
getting into the play of
acting like a half-orc,

1733
01:00:11,342 --> 01:00:12,341
and then they all get serious again

1734
01:00:12,341 --> 01:00:14,138
and look to you and
Kaylee and Kaylee goes,

1735
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,471
"All right then, follow me."

1736
01:00:18,626 --> 01:00:20,309
SAM: She's so good!

1737
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:24,476
Slinks out the door, looks
back and forth for a moment.

1738
01:00:26,396 --> 01:00:27,229
Leans back in.

1739
01:00:27,229 --> 01:00:28,723
"Coast is clear."

1740
01:00:28,723 --> 01:00:29,556
She nods.

1741
01:00:29,556 --> 01:00:31,426
You see a troop of about...

1742
01:00:31,426 --> 01:00:34,926
It would be 12 half-orc looking barbarians

1743
01:00:40,415 --> 01:00:43,359
of varying aggressive stances

1744
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:48,107
start pouring out of a broken
temple and into the street.

1745
01:00:48,107 --> 01:00:50,883
I swoop down a little closer.

1746
01:00:50,883 --> 01:00:52,120
MATT: They're heading--
SAM: And attack us!

1747
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,609
(laughing)

1748
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:54,442
MATT: I'm waiting to see!

1749
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,275
Tippi Hedren.

1750
01:00:55,275 --> 01:00:56,550
Caw!

1751
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,430
Her elemental drop...

1752
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,435
(laughing)

1753
01:00:58,435 --> 01:00:59,268
Super!

1754
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:02,308
Tails in the hole!

1755
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:07,042
Can I tell them it's Scanlan and crew?

1756
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:07,875
No.

1757
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:08,708
You have no idea.

1758
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,176
It's very believable.

1759
01:01:10,176 --> 01:01:11,096
It's very believable.

1760
01:01:11,096 --> 01:01:12,421
And you see this roving
band of half-orcs now

1761
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:14,862
that are heading southward
of the town in a cluster.

1762
01:01:14,862 --> 01:01:15,819
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: They're like,

1763
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:17,008
jumping from one alleyway to another,

1764
01:01:17,008 --> 01:01:19,137
and they're heading kind of southwest.

1765
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:23,664
Am I like, "This is sporadic
for a group of orcs,"

1766
01:01:23,664 --> 01:01:26,291
or am I like, "Crazy
fuckin' group of orcs!"

1767
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,203
Make an insight check.

1768
01:01:27,203 --> 01:01:28,203
All right.

1769
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:29,973
Yeah, it'll work--

1770
01:01:29,973 --> 01:01:32,155
I'm taking it back, I'm taking it back!

1771
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,510
Ooh, that was better, that was better!

1772
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,343
I felt bad.

1773
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:36,176
(laughing)

1774
01:01:36,176 --> 01:01:38,521
ASHLEY: She bailed on her roll-

1775
01:01:38,521 --> 01:01:39,354
No!

1776
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:41,532
(laughing)

1777
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:42,702
I didn't trust it, it was in the air.

1778
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:43,592
26.

1779
01:01:43,592 --> 01:01:44,880
26.

1780
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,948
Something is off about this troop,

1781
01:01:45,948 --> 01:01:48,209
but you're uncertain what it is.

1782
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:49,042
Okay.

1783
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,873
All right.

1784
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:53,811
MATT: All right, you
guys continue to move--

1785
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:56,083
SAM: Continue to move, as fast as possible.

1786
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:59,056
You move southward past
one sequence of alleys

1787
01:01:59,056 --> 01:02:01,737
to the next street, south,
and Kaylee continues

1788
01:02:01,737 --> 01:02:05,070
to usher up to the edge of the alleyway.

1789
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:08,015
She looks back and forth.

1790
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:12,744
Nods, and you guys walk
into the street again.

1791
01:02:12,744 --> 01:02:15,991
As you step into the
street, a voice goes, "Hey!"

1792
01:02:15,991 --> 01:02:18,169
And Kaylee stops and whips around and

1793
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:20,802
looks in that direction, and you can see

1794
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:23,450
a group of three individuals,
led by one Goliath

1795
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:25,595
and there is one kind of wild-looking elf

1796
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:27,134
who has, like, face-paint strewn across

1797
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:28,710
the front of their expression, with this

1798
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,892
long, almost dredlocked, light brown hair,

1799
01:02:31,892 --> 01:02:34,817
and what looks to be an older human

1800
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:36,866
with, like, streaks of black and grey,

1801
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:39,901
and this long, long beard that's
tied off near the stomach.

1802
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:42,517
Bare-chested, with, like,
scars across the chest

1803
01:02:42,517 --> 01:02:44,591
and they all kind of loom
up as the Goliath steps up,

1804
01:02:44,591 --> 01:02:48,726
pointing out, "We need
you to the west gate!"

1805
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:50,726
And he kind of steps up.

1806
01:02:52,524 --> 01:02:54,274
"Who's your watcher?"

1807
01:02:56,065 --> 01:03:00,232
I step forward and say, "He
was killed by that gnome."

1808
01:03:01,572 --> 01:03:04,072
"Gnome? Where'd you see it?"

1809
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:06,446
"Right in the center of town.

1810
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:09,807
"He was a scary undead gnome,
and he's roaming about.

1811
01:03:09,807 --> 01:03:12,245
"Kevdak sent us to search for him."

1812
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:13,499
Make a deception check.

1813
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:16,208
(groans)

1814
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,041
19.

1815
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:19,108
19!

1816
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:19,941
So ugly.

1817
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:23,263
"Center of town, aye?

1818
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:27,954
"Well then, you should
probably come with us, then.

1819
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:30,037
"See if we can swarm it."

1820
01:03:32,733 --> 01:03:34,281
If I may, if I may actually,

1821
01:03:34,281 --> 01:03:35,979
(laughing)

1822
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,828
Kevdak said to follow the
gnome, and he ran this way.

1823
01:03:39,828 --> 01:03:43,578
I'm sorry, we have to
follow Kevdak's orders.

1824
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:48,202
GROUP: Ooooh...

1825
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:51,037
All right, all right.

1826
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:51,870
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1827
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,703
(laughing)

1828
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,453
TALIESIN: Please, please, God!

1829
01:03:56,613 --> 01:03:58,200
Make another deception
check with disadvantage.

1830
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,322
MARISHA: Oh, no!

1831
01:03:59,322 --> 01:04:00,503
TRAVIS: Come on, baby.

1832
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,546
LIAM: "Gotta get there before they

1833
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,796
"run out of cucumber sandwiches!"

1834
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:04,790
ASHLEY: Come on, come on.

1835
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:05,623
Same thing!

1836
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:07,122
19.

1837
01:04:07,122 --> 01:04:11,098
He goes, "All right, we'll
send a few more men your way."

1838
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:11,931
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

1839
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:12,814
"Stay on that trail!

1840
01:04:12,814 --> 01:04:13,986
"If I see you again, and you ain't got

1841
01:04:13,986 --> 01:04:15,270
"a dead gnome in your hands,

1842
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:17,528
"I'm gonna cut that head
from its shoulders."

1843
01:04:17,528 --> 01:04:20,609
All right, you have my
word, we're gonna do--

1844
01:04:20,609 --> 01:04:21,498
see ya later!

1845
01:04:21,498 --> 01:04:23,748
(laughing)

1846
01:04:24,603 --> 01:04:25,436
"Strange one

1847
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:26,269
"All right."

1848
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:29,044
And two of them head back as one of them

1849
01:04:29,044 --> 01:04:31,455
just kind of keeps their
distance behind you guys,

1850
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:33,265
following you as you travel.

1851
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:36,215
You dart into the next alley.

1852
01:04:36,215 --> 01:04:37,881
Kaylee's like " Come on, come on!"

1853
01:04:37,881 --> 01:04:39,207
And as you guys duck into the shadows,

1854
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:41,109
everyone's pace quickens to the center

1855
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:42,906
of this alleyway, where there is...

1856
01:04:42,906 --> 01:04:45,278
It seems like a large stack of

1857
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:47,598
partially emptied crates that contain,

1858
01:04:47,598 --> 01:04:51,080
like, broken pieces of furniture,

1859
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,322
it's essentially a small dump in the area.

1860
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:57,202
Nothing food or, you know, refuse-wise,

1861
01:04:57,202 --> 01:04:58,744
but there's definitely, like, this is a...

1862
01:04:58,744 --> 01:05:01,494
A graveyard for broken furniture.

1863
01:05:02,795 --> 01:05:04,628
But in the center, there is a small,

1864
01:05:04,628 --> 01:05:09,375
cylindrical stone protrusion,
and a grate on top.

1865
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,208
And Kaylee runs up.

1866
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:13,331
"Quick, quick, help me get this open!"

1867
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:14,942
At which point--

1868
01:05:14,942 --> 01:05:15,775
Doctor?

1869
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,434
Dr. Dranzel comes forward and goes,

1870
01:05:17,434 --> 01:05:19,581
"Let me take care of this."

1871
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:20,414
Which is funny, cause Dr. Dranzel

1872
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:22,627
looks just like himself,
but just all covered in...

1873
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,470
(laughing)

1874
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,399
Facepaint, you can't see his hat.

1875
01:05:25,399 --> 01:05:26,367
It's...

1876
01:05:26,367 --> 01:05:30,193
He's kind of enjoying
this persona for a moment.

1877
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:32,368
He goes (spits, grunts)

1878
01:05:32,368 --> 01:05:36,337
and strains as he pulls upward, straight.

1879
01:05:36,337 --> 01:05:37,170
Natural 20!

1880
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,860
(cheers)

1881
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,277
Does he strain?

1882
01:05:41,623 --> 01:05:42,456
Throws it aside--

1883
01:05:42,456 --> 01:05:43,553
Everyone can beat doors but us.

1884
01:05:43,553 --> 01:05:45,237
(laughing)

1885
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:48,287
"And don't you forget it!

1886
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,370
"So, inside?"

1887
01:05:50,577 --> 01:05:52,298
Yes, go, go, go.

1888
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:53,439
And they all start climbing in.

1889
01:05:53,439 --> 01:05:55,056
Dranzel and Kaylee are helping get

1890
01:05:55,056 --> 01:05:56,636
the peasants down inside first,

1891
01:05:56,636 --> 01:05:58,511
at which point the one
that was following you guys

1892
01:05:58,511 --> 01:05:59,843
turns the corner in the alleyway

1893
01:05:59,843 --> 01:06:02,610
and starts approaching from behind.

1894
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:06,392
This is the guy with the
long black and grey beard.

1895
01:06:06,392 --> 01:06:08,642
"You, where are you going?"

1896
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,046
That gnome again.

1897
01:06:12,046 --> 01:06:14,999
One of us saw him go down this sewer.

1898
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:16,332
We're following.

1899
01:06:19,764 --> 01:06:20,999
"I'm gonna have to come
back and report this.

1900
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:22,445
"I don't trust it."

1901
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:23,278
"Hold on one second!"

1902
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:25,710
And I'm gonna cast Hold Person on him.

1903
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:27,400
MATT: Okay.

1904
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,202
LIAM: Get it, get it, get it Scanlan!

1905
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,035
Get it!

1906
01:06:30,035 --> 01:06:31,351
Natural 20 on his saving throw.

1907
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:32,184
Oh, no!

1908
01:06:33,511 --> 01:06:34,344
As he turns around,

1909
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:39,325
and he stops for a second,
looks over his shoulder.

1910
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:40,737
"Oh, you gotta be kidding me, we got--"

1911
01:06:40,737 --> 01:06:43,777
At which point Kaylee
reaches out with her hand

1912
01:06:43,777 --> 01:06:46,694
and let's see if this works or not.

1913
01:06:50,263 --> 01:06:51,096
5, 8...

1914
01:06:55,459 --> 01:06:57,459
LAURA: Too many guys!

1915
01:07:02,004 --> 01:07:03,813
As he turns around and
goes to walk away, he

1916
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:05,428
(laughing)

1917
01:07:05,428 --> 01:07:08,597
falls face first asleep on the ground

1918
01:07:08,597 --> 01:07:11,833
on the outside of the alleyway.

1919
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:12,666
Just, (thuds)

1920
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:14,893
halfway in the sun of
the main thoroughfare.

1921
01:07:14,893 --> 01:07:18,610
Kaylee runs up real fast and
grabs his ankles and drags him.

1922
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,443
I try to help!

1923
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:20,667
"Go, go, go!"

1924
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:21,822
I don't know the ways through the sewers!

1925
01:07:21,822 --> 01:07:23,919
You have to go lead them, not me!

1926
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:24,752
(sighs)

1927
01:07:24,752 --> 01:07:25,588
She drops the leg down.

1928
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:27,018
I start dragging him.

1929
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:28,909
You guys start dragging him off the side,

1930
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:31,659
and you guys quickly go, dart in.

1931
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,380
As you all jump inside,
Dranzel grabs the grate top.

1932
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,666
He gets down behind it--

1933
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:40,119
Right before he closes it, I step out.

1934
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,018
I step out and I say,
"Take them to safety.

1935
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,263
"Bring them outside the city.

1936
01:07:45,263 --> 01:07:46,763
"Hide, stay safe."

1937
01:07:49,489 --> 01:07:51,366
"All right.

1938
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:53,192
"Same goes for you, Scanlan."

1939
01:07:53,192 --> 01:07:55,230
Well, I'll do my best.

1940
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,603
"Yeah you will."

1941
01:07:56,603 --> 01:07:58,732
And he pulls it down,
screws it into place,

1942
01:07:58,732 --> 01:08:01,011
to where it feels kind of taut,

1943
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:03,903
and you are now on your
own outside of this area

1944
01:08:03,903 --> 01:08:08,070
with a sleeping individual as
his snoring slowly subsides.

1945
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:14,452
He starts rousing from his
slumber about a minute later.

1946
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:15,869
Rubbing his chin.

1947
01:08:17,037 --> 01:08:18,062
What do you do?

1948
01:08:18,062 --> 01:08:20,180
While he was still asleep, I was

1949
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:24,053
booking it towards the
western gate, away from him.

1950
01:08:24,053 --> 01:08:25,136
Stelth check.

1951
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:28,911
18.

1952
01:08:33,788 --> 01:08:34,622
Okay.

1953
01:08:36,462 --> 01:08:37,786
All right, so the rest of you guys,

1954
01:08:37,786 --> 01:08:40,754
at this point in time, what's the plan?

1955
01:08:40,754 --> 01:08:42,116
Guys, I'm heading in towards the city.

1956
01:08:42,116 --> 01:08:44,799
Do we have a report yet?

1957
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:45,734
Keyleth?

1958
01:08:45,734 --> 01:08:46,747
I'm getting nervous about Scanlan.

1959
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:47,580
MARISHA: Can I hear him?

1960
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,349
Am I close enough by yet?

1961
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:53,796
I'd say by now you've
returned in raven form,

1962
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,515
you can hear him over the earpiece.

1963
01:08:56,515 --> 01:08:57,929
LIAM: And it's been how
long since we've seen him

1964
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:59,046
since he went in?

1965
01:08:59,046 --> 01:08:59,908
MATT: Since Scanlan went in, I'd say--

1966
01:08:59,908 --> 01:09:00,741
Since the bells.

1967
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:04,011
Since the bells, it's been about...

1968
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:05,801
Oh, man, about ten minutes.

1969
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:06,850
Really?

1970
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,031
We should've seen him by now.

1971
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:11,781
I come down and I land
on Percy's shoulder.

1972
01:09:12,826 --> 01:09:14,761
(caws)

1973
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:15,596
SAM: Not that again.

1974
01:09:15,596 --> 01:09:16,437
(laughing)

1975
01:09:16,437 --> 01:09:17,533
And then I--

1976
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:18,374
Someone fell down a well?

1977
01:09:18,374 --> 01:09:19,263
(laughing)

1978
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:21,834
I come out of raven form.

1979
01:09:21,834 --> 01:09:22,667
Not on my shoulder.

1980
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:25,526
Not on his, well, maybe
I kind of like slide off.

1981
01:09:25,526 --> 01:09:26,359
Sorry!

1982
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:27,192
Sorry.

1983
01:09:27,192 --> 01:09:28,198
What did you see?

1984
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,696
Report, report!

1985
01:09:29,696 --> 01:09:31,216
Okay.

1986
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:35,321
They are ripping all of the
townspeople out of their houses.

1987
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:37,763
It looks like they have their own

1988
01:09:37,763 --> 01:09:40,653
counter plan for a situation like this.

1989
01:09:40,653 --> 01:09:44,153
There was also a band of very strange orcs

1990
01:09:45,254 --> 01:09:48,188
heading this direction,
they were acting strangely,

1991
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:49,279
I don't trust it.

1992
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,765
We can either get out ahead of them,

1993
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:54,225
or try and wait and see if...

1994
01:09:54,225 --> 01:09:55,145
VAX: Were they headed this way?

1995
01:09:55,145 --> 01:09:56,005
They were headed this way.

1996
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:56,838
LIAM: We should probably move then.

1997
01:09:56,838 --> 01:09:57,671
LAURA: Did you see Scanlan?

1998
01:09:57,671 --> 01:09:58,618
Then we should--

1999
01:09:58,618 --> 01:09:59,864
I did not see Scanlan.

2000
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:00,937
Let's head towards the center of town.

2001
01:10:00,937 --> 01:10:01,953
They might have him held prisoner.

2002
01:10:01,953 --> 01:10:03,322
MARISHA: They might
have him held prisoner.

2003
01:10:03,322 --> 01:10:04,836
Why didn't we give a gatestone?

2004
01:10:04,836 --> 01:10:05,993
We should always give--

2005
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:06,959
LAURA: Because we're fucking morons!

2006
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:08,560
I didn't know he was going to go that far!

2007
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,102
LAURA: I thought he was just going to the gate.

2008
01:10:10,102 --> 01:10:12,160
LIAM: Every time, that's the thing, okay?

2009
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,321
Gate stones.

2010
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:15,780
I promise when this is over,

2011
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,780
I will surgically implant it in him.

2012
01:10:20,274 --> 01:10:21,107
Scanlan, can you--

2013
01:10:21,107 --> 01:10:23,209
Scanlan, can you hear us at all?

2014
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:24,184
TALIESIN: Hello?

2015
01:10:24,184 --> 01:10:26,191
TRAVIS: Anything?

2016
01:10:26,191 --> 01:10:27,079
We just gotta go in.

2017
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:28,075
Dammit!

2018
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:29,781
I'm gonna start making
my way on the rooftops

2019
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:31,442
towards the center of the town, I'm like

2020
01:10:31,442 --> 01:10:33,811
"I'm heading in, I'm keeping to the roof,

2021
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:35,271
"if I'm going to take any shots

2022
01:10:35,271 --> 01:10:36,431
"I'll try and take them quietly."

2023
01:10:36,431 --> 01:10:37,264
I fly up and I--

2024
01:10:37,264 --> 01:10:38,921
I go along the roofline with him.

2025
01:10:38,921 --> 01:10:41,585
I fly up on the broom, and then I

2026
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:43,735
land on the rooftop and stealth.

2027
01:10:43,735 --> 01:10:44,568
Okay.

2028
01:10:44,568 --> 01:10:47,390
It's at this point in time
you see the two giant eagles,

2029
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,822
the ones that took Keyleth off earlier.

2030
01:10:49,822 --> 01:10:51,322
As you come up on your
broom, it kind of sees you.

2031
01:10:51,322 --> 01:10:53,375
(screech)

2032
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,844
TALIESIN: Oh, I've been watching those things.

2033
01:10:54,844 --> 01:10:55,677
Right.

2034
01:10:55,677 --> 01:10:56,874
And as you're having this discussion,

2035
01:10:56,874 --> 01:10:58,788
they notice up her float up and

2036
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:01,116
kind of see you guys
moving in towards the city.

2037
01:11:01,116 --> 01:11:02,807
One of them just turns around,

2038
01:11:02,807 --> 01:11:04,697
heads back to the center of town.

2039
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:05,530
LAURA: Eh, shitballs.

2040
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,540
Another one's taking a cheap shot at you.

2041
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,540
Towards you.

2042
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,291
Roll initiative.

2043
01:11:12,876 --> 01:11:13,709
Everybody who's gonna have anything

2044
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:14,679
to do with this right now.

2045
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:15,967
Oh, I'm getting in on this shit, too.

2046
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,800
LAURA: Yeah.

2047
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,244
How far away from--

2048
01:11:18,244 --> 01:11:19,077
24.

2049
01:11:19,077 --> 01:11:19,910
They're probably a good--

2050
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,648
LIAM: Way up high in the sky on this one?

2051
01:11:21,648 --> 01:11:23,048
MARISHA: Are we trying to get this--

2052
01:11:23,048 --> 01:11:25,136
We're talking about 100 to
150 feet up, comparatively.

2053
01:11:25,136 --> 01:11:26,411
Are we trying to get this eagle?

2054
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:27,349
Is that what we're trying--

2055
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:28,231
Yeah.

2056
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:29,119
It's trying to kill me.

2057
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:29,952
TALIESIN: 19.

2058
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,961
Yeah, can I get in on that as well?

2059
01:11:31,961 --> 01:11:33,009
MATT: Yeah, roll initiative.

2060
01:11:33,009 --> 01:11:34,280
All right, so...

2061
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,530
LAURA: 24.

2062
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,754
MATT: 24, Jesus.

2063
01:11:36,754 --> 01:11:38,197
And 19.

2064
01:11:38,197 --> 01:11:39,030
MATT: 19.

2065
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,863
18.

2066
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:40,696
Nice!

2067
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:41,696
Yeah, man!

2068
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:44,745
MATT: (sneezes)
Sorry, what did you get?

2069
01:11:44,745 --> 01:11:45,578
ASHLEY: 18.

2070
01:11:45,578 --> 01:11:46,411
MATT: 18, all right.

2071
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:47,411
LAURA: Sarenrae blesses you.

2072
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,083
17.

2073
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:52,912
12 for Keyleth.

2074
01:11:52,912 --> 01:11:54,745
MATT: All right.

2075
01:11:55,597 --> 01:11:56,430
All right.

2076
01:11:57,608 --> 01:12:00,927
All right, Vex, as the eagle swoops in,

2077
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:03,916
you have a brief moment
where it's coming at you.

2078
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:05,432
You can go ahead and make your shots at it

2079
01:12:05,432 --> 01:12:07,101
or whatever you wanna do this round.

2080
01:12:07,101 --> 01:12:07,934
What do you want to do?

2081
01:12:07,934 --> 01:12:08,767
How--

2082
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,438
if I, if I land on the
ground and shoot at it,

2083
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:12,438
will it be within range?

2084
01:12:13,312 --> 01:12:14,145
MATT: At the speed it's going,

2085
01:12:14,145 --> 01:12:14,978
you're not gonna be able to

2086
01:12:14,978 --> 01:12:16,010
get back on the ground this round

2087
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:16,843
unless you spend your
whole round getting there.

2088
01:12:16,843 --> 01:12:17,676
Then I shoot at it from the air.

2089
01:12:17,676 --> 01:12:21,759
MATT: Okay, so two
shots at a disadvantage.

2090
01:12:24,763 --> 01:12:26,867
Uh, 25 on the first.

2091
01:12:26,867 --> 01:12:29,260
On the first, all righty, that hits.

2092
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,510
LAURA: Okay.

2093
01:12:33,374 --> 01:12:34,949
17 on the first hit.

2094
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:36,233
MATT: 17 damage?

2095
01:12:36,233 --> 01:12:37,158
Yes.

2096
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,274
MATT: All righty.

2097
01:12:38,274 --> 01:12:40,113
And 24 on the second hit.

2098
01:12:40,113 --> 01:12:43,780
TRAVIS: Dang, girl.
MATT: That hits.

2099
01:12:45,171 --> 01:12:46,608
Uh, 13 on the second hit.

2100
01:12:46,608 --> 01:12:49,435
Okay, as you, this is with
a disadvantage, right?

2101
01:12:49,435 --> 01:12:50,268
LAURA: Yeah.

2102
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:51,211
As you release the first arrow,

2103
01:12:51,211 --> 01:12:53,904
wings are up, giant sharp beak extended,

2104
01:12:53,904 --> 01:12:56,274
its claws in the air, the
arrow sinks into its body,

2105
01:12:56,274 --> 01:12:57,465
but it still kind of just shakes it off,

2106
01:12:57,465 --> 01:12:59,510
continuing going into a
further dive toward you,

2107
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:00,343
its wings outward.

2108
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:01,176
LAURA: Fucker!

2109
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,279
The second arrow, the second arrow

2110
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:03,404
strikes at the side of the face,

2111
01:13:03,404 --> 01:13:04,410
kinda scrapes across and embeds

2112
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,736
in front of its winged shoulder.

2113
01:13:05,736 --> 01:13:06,569
At which point, its form goes

2114
01:13:06,569 --> 01:13:08,132
(wooshing noise)

2115
01:13:08,132 --> 01:13:11,042
into what you see to
be a female elven form

2116
01:13:11,042 --> 01:13:11,875
(gasps)

2117
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:16,329
and then just drops
straight down for 100 feet.

2118
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:17,544
TALIESIN: Into the pit?

2119
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:18,377
Into the pit?

2120
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:19,358
Uh, no, this is more
inside the city right now.

2121
01:13:19,358 --> 01:13:20,191
Damn.

2122
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:21,024
But she was 250 feet up!

2123
01:13:21,024 --> 01:13:22,328
That turned out to be about 100 feet up.

2124
01:13:22,328 --> 01:13:23,652
That still sounds pretty bad!

2125
01:13:23,652 --> 01:13:24,657
Really bad.

2126
01:13:24,657 --> 01:13:26,730
SAM: I don't wanna drop from...

2127
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:28,809
TRAVIS: It's like softball, right?

2128
01:13:28,809 --> 01:13:29,996
I'm just waiting.

2129
01:13:31,163 --> 01:13:32,493
You guys watch as she just goes

2130
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:34,022
(falling sound, thud)

2131
01:13:34,022 --> 01:13:35,180
(laughing)

2132
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,331
Like, there's a little--

2133
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:38,164
LAURA: Oh, no.

2134
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,149
A little elf puddle?

2135
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:39,982
TALIESIN: Is that other one still looking?

2136
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,683
MATT: The other one's still looking.

2137
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:43,073
Out of bad news range?

2138
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:45,445
Uh, no, still within bad news range.

2139
01:13:45,445 --> 01:13:46,495
ASHLEY: Take the shot.

2140
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,727
LAURA: Do it, Percy!

2141
01:13:47,727 --> 01:13:49,920
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, not
only am I gonna take a shot--

2142
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,753
TRAVIS: Gonna ring that bell, are you?

2143
01:13:50,753 --> 01:13:52,457
I'm gonna take a, gonna take a wing shot.

2144
01:13:52,457 --> 01:13:55,602
Keyleth runs towards the girl who fell.

2145
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:57,613
LAURA: Good job, good job, guys.

2146
01:13:57,613 --> 01:13:59,414
MATT: So you start
heading in that direction.

2147
01:13:59,414 --> 01:14:00,247
MARISHA: Yeah.

2148
01:14:00,247 --> 01:14:01,390
MATT: Taking your two shots.

2149
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,705
I'm gonna do a ring shot,
we'll see what happens.

2150
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:03,716
TRAVIS: If you miss, we move.

2151
01:14:03,716 --> 01:14:04,549
MATT: Okay.

2152
01:14:04,549 --> 01:14:07,182
Oh, yeah, that's 28.

2153
01:14:07,182 --> 01:14:08,146
28 hits.

2154
01:14:08,146 --> 01:14:11,033
This is gonna suck for her.

2155
01:14:11,033 --> 01:14:11,866
Here we go.

2156
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:12,699
(explosion noise)

2157
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:13,532
Really loud--

2158
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:14,365
MATT: Loud, echoing blasts--

2159
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:15,198
They knew we were coming already.

2160
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:16,185
MATT: Echoing through the city.

2161
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:20,010
They're already gathering
people in the center of town.

2162
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:20,843
A little late now.

2163
01:14:20,843 --> 01:14:21,820
We kill a bunch of them,

2164
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,924
oh God, that's awful.

2165
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,117
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

2166
01:14:24,117 --> 01:14:26,652
Uh, 13 points of piercing damage.

2167
01:14:26,652 --> 01:14:27,485
MATT: Okay.

2168
01:14:27,485 --> 01:14:29,740
And she also has to make
a strength saving throw.

2169
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,753
Uh, that is gonna be a...

2170
01:14:31,753 --> 01:14:33,249
19?

2171
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,253
Not going to beat that.

2172
01:14:35,253 --> 01:14:36,250
12.

2173
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,191
I think she--

2174
01:14:37,191 --> 01:14:39,893
It says she gets knocked prone,

2175
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:40,894
so I don't know what you want to

2176
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:42,342
call that for something flying, but--

2177
01:14:42,342 --> 01:14:43,424
That's, she's falling now.

2178
01:14:43,424 --> 01:14:44,257
TALIESIN: Yep.

2179
01:14:44,257 --> 01:14:45,176
Yep.

2180
01:14:45,176 --> 01:14:46,996
And so she's falling, you
hit her, one of the wings

2181
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:49,643
and she begins plummeting downward,

2182
01:14:49,643 --> 01:14:52,945
not able to gather air at the
moment underneath the wings.

2183
01:14:52,945 --> 01:14:53,888
Are you taking your second shot?

2184
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:54,779
Uh, sure, I'll just take,

2185
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:56,840
and for this one, I'm gonna be an asshole

2186
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,179
and just take a sharpshooter shot.

2187
01:14:59,179 --> 01:15:00,012
MATT: Okay.

2188
01:15:00,012 --> 01:15:00,931
And I'll use the big die!

2189
01:15:00,931 --> 01:15:01,764
MATT: Go for it.

2190
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:02,765
Trade up.

2191
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:04,342
Uh, that's a--

2192
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:05,640
I'll say before you commit,
I'll say this has disadvantage

2193
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,126
because it went from
flying at a smooth pace

2194
01:15:08,126 --> 01:15:10,045
to plummeting and you have to quickly--

2195
01:15:10,045 --> 01:15:11,978
TALIESIN: I had to reload
in the middle, so like--

2196
01:15:11,978 --> 01:15:12,811
Yeah.

2197
01:15:12,811 --> 01:15:13,644
I'm, like, skeet shooting here.

2198
01:15:13,644 --> 01:15:14,477
MATT: Yeah.

2199
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:15,310
Ugh.

2200
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,949
That's a, I'm gonna miss.

2201
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:19,834
That's like a 5 to hit, so that...

2202
01:15:19,834 --> 01:15:21,354
That's 12.

2203
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:22,454
12 just hits.

2204
01:15:22,454 --> 01:15:23,479
(gasps)

2205
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:25,002
Giant eagle AC is not that great, man!

2206
01:15:25,002 --> 01:15:26,146
That's so sad!

2207
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:28,598
Oh God, I feel bad now!

2208
01:15:28,598 --> 01:15:29,431
(laughing)

2209
01:15:29,431 --> 01:15:30,264
LAURA: 12?

2210
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:31,683
MATT: Giant eagle
doesn't have a crazy AC.

2211
01:15:31,683 --> 01:15:33,210
That, oh man, I really feel--

2212
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,128
MATT: It's more of a travel form,

2213
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:35,597
it's not meant for...

2214
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:36,430
Fighting.

2215
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:37,263
You know, main fighting.

2216
01:15:37,263 --> 01:15:38,323
The one that was going for you is

2217
01:15:38,323 --> 01:15:39,749
just 'cause you were the
one that was nearest to it.

2218
01:15:39,749 --> 01:15:43,832
It wasn't expecting a hail
of arrows in its face.

2219
01:15:44,765 --> 01:15:46,588
29 points of damage.

2220
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:48,828
And with that, you see it falls an eagle,

2221
01:15:48,828 --> 01:15:50,886
and then (wooshing noise)
into a person, it falls--

2222
01:15:50,886 --> 01:15:52,196
(laughing)

2223
01:15:52,196 --> 01:15:55,160
and disappear behind the skyline

2224
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,570
of the building of Westruun that

2225
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,120
block your view of the center of town.

2226
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,344
Well, they don't know
who's coming, at least.

2227
01:16:01,344 --> 01:16:03,025
ASHLEY: Are we close enough to
loot that first body?

2228
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,663
Sure, you guys--

2229
01:16:04,663 --> 01:16:05,920
MARISHA: Well, I was headed that way.

2230
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:06,867
ASHLEY: We're headed that way.

2231
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:07,762
You guys then--

2232
01:16:07,762 --> 01:16:09,170
TALIESIN: I'm staying on the roof.

2233
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,778
Moving around the chasm
you create, you head

2234
01:16:10,778 --> 01:16:12,954
inside the western gate
of Westruun at this point.

2235
01:16:12,954 --> 01:16:14,518
MARISHA: Hang on, wait, well,

2236
01:16:14,518 --> 01:16:16,348
oh, I'm headed to the body still?

2237
01:16:16,348 --> 01:16:17,287
It's inside the gate?

2238
01:16:17,287 --> 01:16:18,120
Yeah.

2239
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,388
Yeah, it fell inside the gate of the city.

2240
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:22,886
You approach, and it's a rough scene.

2241
01:16:22,886 --> 01:16:24,562
Fell on, like, the head and the shoulder.

2242
01:16:24,562 --> 01:16:25,839
The rest of the body's kind of--

2243
01:16:25,839 --> 01:16:26,672
LAURA: Ew!

2244
01:16:26,672 --> 01:16:28,473
Accordioned in.

2245
01:16:28,473 --> 01:16:29,903
Like the body, does it appear to be

2246
01:16:29,903 --> 01:16:32,771
any druid related to the Ashari clan?

2247
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:36,867
Looking it over, make
an investigation check.

2248
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:38,831
TALIESIN: Figure out
which end is up first.

2249
01:16:38,831 --> 01:16:40,520
I need a really good check.

2250
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,392
My investigation's not very good.

2251
01:16:42,392 --> 01:16:43,408
It's your dad!

2252
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:44,241
Oh!

2253
01:16:44,241 --> 01:16:46,778
(laughing)

2254
01:16:46,778 --> 01:16:48,065
20.

2255
01:16:48,065 --> 01:16:48,898
20.

2256
01:16:48,898 --> 01:16:50,438
You take a quick glance
over, checking where any

2257
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:54,105
ceremonial markings of
the Ashari are, none.

2258
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:56,852
This individual appears to be more of

2259
01:16:56,852 --> 01:16:59,352
a primal-based Druidic talent.

2260
01:17:00,506 --> 01:17:03,191
There are tattoos, pretty basic,

2261
01:17:03,191 --> 01:17:07,500
various animal totems that
are inscribed on the body.

2262
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,038
You're familiar with
this form of druidic magic.

2263
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:11,563
It's a less-refined version of

2264
01:17:11,563 --> 01:17:13,421
what the Ashari people learn and teach.

2265
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,348
MARISHA: Gotcha.

2266
01:17:14,348 --> 01:17:16,604
But yeah, there's no inclination

2267
01:17:16,604 --> 01:17:18,489
this is a member of the Ashari.

2268
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:19,322
Okay.

2269
01:17:19,322 --> 01:17:21,049
So, is there anything good on her?

2270
01:17:21,049 --> 01:17:22,299
There is a...

2271
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:27,381
A soaked set of leather armor.

2272
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:28,214
(chuckles)

2273
01:17:28,214 --> 01:17:29,670
TRAVIS: Soaked in what?
MARISHA: Non-magical?

2274
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:32,863
Non-magical, from what you can gather.

2275
01:17:32,863 --> 01:17:33,863
SAM: Pee.

2276
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,166
And what looks to be a
shattered quarter-staff

2277
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:40,720
that may have been landed on.

2278
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,803
(groans)

2279
01:17:43,991 --> 01:17:46,906
Beyond that, you're gonna have to get

2280
01:17:46,906 --> 01:17:48,659
sifting through the remains,

2281
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:49,780
it's not gonna be a fun experience

2282
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,104
for what little you may gather.

2283
01:17:51,104 --> 01:17:51,937
I'll let it go.

2284
01:17:51,937 --> 01:17:52,770
LIAM: You gonna start harvesting?

2285
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:53,603
I'll let it go.

2286
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:54,718
(laughing)

2287
01:17:54,718 --> 01:17:56,320
MATT: "Start harvesting."

2288
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,491
TRAVIS: She made her choice.

2289
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:00,209
(laughing)

2290
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:01,738
Well, I'm gonna start
rooftopping towards the center.

2291
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:03,551
If I see anything interesting
going on in the city,

2292
01:18:03,551 --> 01:18:05,153
I wanna stop and investigate.

2293
01:18:05,153 --> 01:18:05,986
Ditto!

2294
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:06,819
Sneaking from rooftop to rooftop?

2295
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:07,652
If I can, can I do a bit of--

2296
01:18:07,652 --> 01:18:08,973
I'm gonna do that, for sure.

2297
01:18:08,973 --> 01:18:10,857
Can I use acrobatics?

2298
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:13,690
You, this more of a,
this isn't acrobatics,

2299
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,664
this is more of a jump.

2300
01:18:14,664 --> 01:18:17,836
Because there are large,
large city street gaps

2301
01:18:17,836 --> 01:18:19,121
that are, like, 25 to 30 feet.

2302
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:19,954
MARISHA: What about parkouring?

2303
01:18:19,954 --> 01:18:21,118
But if I can parkour it, I can find,

2304
01:18:21,118 --> 01:18:21,951
I wanna be able to...

2305
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,784
Parkour, parkour!

2306
01:18:22,784 --> 01:18:23,617
I wanna try and be smart about it

2307
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:25,010
and find it any way I can make it.

2308
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:27,144
Right, make an acrobatics check.

2309
01:18:27,144 --> 01:18:27,977
TALIESIN: An acrobatics check?

2310
01:18:27,977 --> 01:18:28,810
Thank you.

2311
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,643
SAM: Amateur Spider-man.

2312
01:18:29,643 --> 01:18:30,476
LAURA: Can I join in?

2313
01:18:30,476 --> 01:18:31,715
I was gonna join in.

2314
01:18:31,715 --> 01:18:32,648
Up there.

2315
01:18:32,648 --> 01:18:34,642
MATT: Do you want to get
off your broom and do that?

2316
01:18:34,642 --> 01:18:35,482
That was the thing, yeah, I was gonna

2317
01:18:35,482 --> 01:18:37,909
fly up on the broom and
land on the roofs and then--

2318
01:18:37,909 --> 01:18:38,742
MATT: Gotcha.

2319
01:18:38,742 --> 01:18:40,228
Yeah, so you go ahead
and you get up with him

2320
01:18:40,228 --> 01:18:41,669
and you can go--

2321
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:43,904
the two of you can start, like,
parkouring off the rooftop.

2322
01:18:43,904 --> 01:18:45,517
LIAM: There's a mechanical engineer on the roof.

2323
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:46,552
(laughing)

2324
01:18:46,552 --> 01:18:47,872
23.

2325
01:18:47,872 --> 01:18:48,705
MATT: 23?

2326
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:51,099
SAM: (screams)

2327
01:18:51,099 --> 01:18:52,940
You guys make it a
couple of streets before

2328
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,409
you reach a point where this block does,

2329
01:18:55,409 --> 01:18:56,676
'cause the main street intersects

2330
01:18:56,676 --> 01:18:58,341
with another main street
that goes southward

2331
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:00,497
and the gap is about
30 feet to jump across

2332
01:19:00,497 --> 01:19:01,448
and you know from experience that

2333
01:19:01,448 --> 01:19:03,587
you couldn't do that with a regular jump.

2334
01:19:03,587 --> 01:19:04,538
I've got an idea.

2335
01:19:04,538 --> 01:19:05,944
If you give me the
broom, I'll just hold on

2336
01:19:05,944 --> 01:19:08,234
and plant me down if we see anything.

2337
01:19:08,234 --> 01:19:09,861
We'll just keep low by the roof.

2338
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:10,694
(laughing)

2339
01:19:10,694 --> 01:19:11,865
LAURA: Can't you just
sit on the broom with me?

2340
01:19:11,865 --> 01:19:13,869
What is going on, are Grog and Pike and I

2341
01:19:13,869 --> 01:19:15,367
just supposed to stand
over here by the gate?

2342
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:16,367
Are you guys gonna head off?

2343
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:17,259
MARISHA: We have a plan.

2344
01:19:17,259 --> 01:19:18,222
I thought we were going in.

2345
01:19:18,222 --> 01:19:19,333
We're heading into the city--

2346
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,411
LAURA: I thought we were all going in.

2347
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:21,622
I mean, we had a plan, and then

2348
01:19:21,622 --> 01:19:23,019
we didn't have a plan, so we have like...

2349
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,439
LIAM: We're going seven
different directions.

2350
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:26,129
You look up as you see,
suddenly glance overhead,

2351
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:29,121
a shadow from one rooftop to another.

2352
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:31,121
Make a perception check.

2353
01:19:32,818 --> 01:19:33,651
Uh, 18.

2354
01:19:33,651 --> 01:19:34,484
TALIESIN: It's Batman!

2355
01:19:34,484 --> 01:19:35,317
18.

2356
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:36,150
You glance up and you see the

2357
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:38,733
dangling, kicking feet of Percy

2358
01:19:40,691 --> 01:19:42,721
underneath a broom that
just (wooshing noise)

2359
01:19:42,721 --> 01:19:43,740
across the top of that.

2360
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,668
All right.

2361
01:19:44,668 --> 01:19:46,724
I didn't know there was room on there!

2362
01:19:46,724 --> 01:19:47,830
They're traveling, yes?

2363
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,647
Yeah, they're traveling
back inward to the city.

2364
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:51,050
All right.

2365
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,181
Well, that's good.

2366
01:19:52,181 --> 01:19:54,707
I can't, I probably can't catch up.

2367
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,222
I'm just gonna keep hoofing it.

2368
01:19:57,222 --> 01:19:58,066
LAURA: Wait, but the earrings!

2369
01:19:58,066 --> 01:19:59,995
Oh wait, I can hear, yes, yes!

2370
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:01,540
Ooh!

2371
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,373
(laughing)

2372
01:20:02,373 --> 01:20:03,206
Thank you, I forgot about that!

2373
01:20:03,206 --> 01:20:04,039
Uh, yeah.

2374
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:06,664
Hey, hi, oi, guys, oi, oi.

2375
01:20:06,664 --> 01:20:08,107
LAURA: Scanlan!

2376
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:09,065
SAM: Oi, oi.

2377
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:10,199
SAM: How's it going?

2378
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:11,304
Did my plan work?

2379
01:20:11,304 --> 01:20:12,278
MARISHA: I don't know, did your plan work?

2380
01:20:12,278 --> 01:20:13,123
TALIESIN: What was your plan?

2381
01:20:13,123 --> 01:20:14,448
My plan was to send all the Goliaths,

2382
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:16,490
all of them, out through the main gate.

2383
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:18,050
Did they all come through the main gate?

2384
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:18,883
No.

2385
01:20:18,883 --> 01:20:19,716
No, definitely not.

2386
01:20:19,716 --> 01:20:20,880
LIAM: If there was only six, it worked.

2387
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,342
MARISHA: Scanlan, it appears they are

2388
01:20:22,342 --> 01:20:23,897
doubling down in the center of the town.

2389
01:20:23,897 --> 01:20:26,477
Do you have any idea on why
they would be doing this?

2390
01:20:26,477 --> 01:20:30,091
Well, I don't know,
they're very perceptive.

2391
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:34,304
I may have alerted all
of them to our presence.

2392
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,581
MARISHA: Oh, fantastic.
SAM: But...

2393
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,515
It was a distraction.
MARISHA: Sure.

2394
01:20:37,515 --> 01:20:39,447
And in a sense, that was my mission, so--

2395
01:20:39,447 --> 01:20:40,831
TALIESIN: A distraction from what?

2396
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:42,638
LAURA: You know what, we killed nine of them.

2397
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,540
MARISHA: A distraction from

2398
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,407
their terrible, terrible lives.

2399
01:20:46,407 --> 01:20:47,970
TRAVIS: Good job, Scanlan, mission accomplished.

2400
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:50,111
Yes, thank you, thank you.

2401
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:51,507
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan, I'm glad you're okay.

2402
01:20:51,507 --> 01:20:53,801
Oh, thanks, is that Pike?

2403
01:20:53,801 --> 01:20:54,634
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2404
01:20:54,634 --> 01:20:55,467
Oh, hi, Pike!

2405
01:20:55,467 --> 01:20:56,300
ASHLEY: Hi!

2406
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,775
Oh, how's it going out there?

2407
01:20:57,775 --> 01:20:58,978
Oh, it's good, it's good--

2408
01:20:58,978 --> 01:21:00,107
Can we do this--

2409
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:01,440
Okay, okay, okay.

2410
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,398
What should I do, where
should I go, who should I kill?

2411
01:21:05,398 --> 01:21:07,080
LIAM: Stay put and let us come to you.

2412
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,261
What do you see around you?

2413
01:21:08,261 --> 01:21:09,187
MARISHA: Yeah, where are you?

2414
01:21:09,187 --> 01:21:11,463
SAM: Idiots on broomsticks flying around.

2415
01:21:11,463 --> 01:21:13,355
LAURA: Oh, shit, that's us!

2416
01:21:13,355 --> 01:21:14,188
All right.

2417
01:21:14,188 --> 01:21:16,234
Can we all convene in an alley?

2418
01:21:16,234 --> 01:21:17,163
You do.

2419
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:19,536
You convene in an alley.

2420
01:21:19,536 --> 01:21:21,988
Within the next few
minutes, a little bit of a

2421
01:21:21,988 --> 01:21:23,442
confusing telephone bit
going back and forth,

2422
01:21:23,442 --> 01:21:26,277
but you do eventually gather.

2423
01:21:26,277 --> 01:21:28,737
At this time, you guys do hear

2424
01:21:28,737 --> 01:21:30,850
what sounds like some voices shouting

2425
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,850
about a block and a half up the way.

2426
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,034
LAURA: Shit.

2427
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:38,371
MARISHA: Okay.

2428
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:39,677
TRAVIS: Are there buildings?

2429
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:40,659
SAM: Are we all together now?

2430
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:41,492
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

2431
01:21:41,492 --> 01:21:44,248
By the way, hi, hi, this is me.

2432
01:21:44,248 --> 01:21:45,740
LAURA: Oh my god, you don't
even look like yourself.

2433
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,698
I look pretty cool.

2434
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:47,867
TRAVIS: It's so good to see you.

2435
01:21:47,867 --> 01:21:49,022
We should get inside for a moment.

2436
01:21:49,022 --> 01:21:49,874
We should.

2437
01:21:49,874 --> 01:21:53,349
Is there a wine cellar
or door or something

2438
01:21:53,349 --> 01:21:55,002
that we can beat in, or a window?

2439
01:21:55,002 --> 01:21:56,329
There are windows, you
don't see a wine cellar

2440
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,734
in the immediate vicinity
of this alleyway.

2441
01:21:57,734 --> 01:22:01,319
LIAM: I'll get it open quietly,
I'm not gonna break anything!

2442
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:02,786
TRAVIS: Can I look in the window first?

2443
01:22:02,786 --> 01:22:03,716
Yeah, you go ahead and glance in.

2444
01:22:03,716 --> 01:22:05,716
Make a perception check.

2445
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,700
I see nothing. It's a 2.

2446
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,770
MATT: It is very dark.

2447
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:11,179
There's no light inside, and--

2448
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:12,138
LAURA: What about our darkvision?

2449
01:22:12,138 --> 01:22:13,184
Can we see anything in there?

2450
01:22:13,184 --> 01:22:14,017
No.

2451
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:15,684
Even if your darkvision,
you guys see as well,

2452
01:22:15,684 --> 01:22:16,646
there's nothing inside.

2453
01:22:16,646 --> 01:22:17,940
The building appears to be vacant.

2454
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,212
LIAM: Is it locked?

2455
01:22:19,212 --> 01:22:20,907
The window is locked.

2456
01:22:20,907 --> 01:22:22,172
Very minor lock.

2457
01:22:22,172 --> 01:22:23,346
Well, I just rolled a natural 20, so...

2458
01:22:23,346 --> 01:22:24,903
LAURA: You wasted it on a window?

2459
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:27,517
MATT: That was the most deft
unlocking you've ever done.

2460
01:22:27,517 --> 01:22:28,350
LIAM: I hit it like Fonzie.

2461
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,183
Yeah.

2462
01:22:29,183 --> 01:22:31,282
(laughing)

2463
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:33,691
We pop in the window.

2464
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:34,524
Great.

2465
01:22:34,524 --> 01:22:35,891
You guys all crawl inside of the room, and

2466
01:22:35,891 --> 01:22:39,308
looking inside, you do notice that the...

2467
01:22:40,269 --> 01:22:43,445
Some of the furniture
is kind of tipped over,

2468
01:22:43,445 --> 01:22:45,242
the front door, actually, that leads

2469
01:22:45,242 --> 01:22:48,489
out to the main road,
the south-facing road,

2470
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:53,195
the knob is broken off like
someone just kicked the door in.

2471
01:22:53,195 --> 01:22:55,817
And it looks like there were
signs of a minor struggle,

2472
01:22:55,817 --> 01:22:58,335
but there's no bloodshed
from what you can see.

2473
01:22:58,335 --> 01:23:01,461
Most of, if any, belongings that

2474
01:23:01,461 --> 01:23:02,868
had any value have been taken.

2475
01:23:02,868 --> 01:23:05,303
The place looks stripped
of anything metallic.

2476
01:23:05,303 --> 01:23:07,760
It looks like it's been pretty heavily

2477
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,519
ransacked inside here.

2478
01:23:09,519 --> 01:23:10,891
MARISHA: Grog.
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2479
01:23:10,891 --> 01:23:14,024
They were dragging everyone
out of every available door,

2480
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:16,356
and dragging them to the
city, the center of the city.

2481
01:23:16,356 --> 01:23:17,189
Why?

2482
01:23:18,382 --> 01:23:20,719
TRAVIS: People shields.

2483
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:21,882
Meat shields.

2484
01:23:21,882 --> 01:23:22,715
Meat shields?

2485
01:23:22,715 --> 01:23:23,821
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Right.

2486
01:23:23,821 --> 01:23:24,654
Okay.

2487
01:23:24,654 --> 01:23:27,026
So we go to them, and if we get too close,

2488
01:23:27,026 --> 01:23:28,765
they slit all their throats.

2489
01:23:28,765 --> 01:23:31,966
It's like basic Goliath logic.

2490
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:32,799
LAURA: Lovely.

2491
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:35,872
LIAM: So is maybe the one-on-one combat

2492
01:23:35,872 --> 01:23:38,111
our only option at the moment?

2493
01:23:38,111 --> 01:23:41,177
Do we have any other option?

2494
01:23:41,177 --> 01:23:42,753
How many were there total?

2495
01:23:42,753 --> 01:23:43,586
We don't know how many...

2496
01:23:43,586 --> 01:23:44,979
Probably 30 to 40 now.

2497
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:46,208
SAM: Oh, okay.

2498
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:47,813
Probably down to 20 or 30.

2499
01:23:47,813 --> 01:23:48,646
Well.

2500
01:23:49,864 --> 01:23:51,743
Wait, there was 30 or 40 to start,

2501
01:23:51,743 --> 01:23:52,914
and we killed nine of them?

2502
01:23:52,914 --> 01:23:54,478
Remember, he said we were down to like 50.

2503
01:23:54,478 --> 01:23:56,435
We killed, like, nine-ish.

2504
01:23:56,435 --> 01:23:57,440
SAM: Oh, so 40-ish.

2505
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,337
So two left.

2506
01:23:58,337 --> 01:24:00,059
LAURA: Six left, Grog, then, six?

2507
01:24:00,059 --> 01:24:01,190
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like a thousand.

2508
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:02,317
(laughing)

2509
01:24:02,317 --> 01:24:03,789
TALIESIN: Let's...

2510
01:24:05,275 --> 01:24:06,108
MARISHA: Okay.

2511
01:24:07,218 --> 01:24:08,051
All right.

2512
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:09,275
SAM: I've got a plan.

2513
01:24:09,275 --> 01:24:10,865
I go to the center of town.

2514
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:11,698
Yeah.

2515
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:12,614
I create a distraction.

2516
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:14,686
(laughing)

2517
01:24:14,686 --> 01:24:15,519
LAURA: Seriously?

2518
01:24:15,519 --> 01:24:18,106
That's pretty much all
my plans are, always.

2519
01:24:18,106 --> 01:24:19,418
TRAVIS: What time is it?

2520
01:24:19,418 --> 01:24:21,744
MATT: Right now, you're
pushing early afternoon.

2521
01:24:21,744 --> 01:24:24,935
It's probably, I'd say the
equivalent of about 1, 1:30.

2522
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,203
LAURA: Jeez.
TRAVIS: Perfect.

2523
01:24:26,203 --> 01:24:27,036
Last question I have.

2524
01:24:27,036 --> 01:24:29,342
Do we know where Wilhand's
residence used to be?

2525
01:24:29,342 --> 01:24:30,910
MATT: You do, you would know very well.

2526
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:31,752
It's outside of town.

2527
01:24:31,752 --> 01:24:32,700
MATT: You spent a lot of your time--

2528
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,625
Outside or inside?

2529
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,799
It's inside the town, but it's a

2530
01:24:34,799 --> 01:24:38,281
little bit northwest of the center area.

2531
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:40,600
So it's closer to where a lot of the

2532
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,376
temples and the worship areas are,

2533
01:24:43,376 --> 01:24:46,908
and there is a small park
there that was across the way.

2534
01:24:46,908 --> 01:24:48,357
LIAM: That may be something useful.

2535
01:24:48,357 --> 01:24:49,595
It's a red brick building.

2536
01:24:49,595 --> 01:24:50,727
It stands out against a lot of it,

2537
01:24:50,727 --> 01:24:52,089
because it was built specifically

2538
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:53,898
to kind of be the small, gnomish hovel

2539
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:56,838
that was built buy his own hands.

2540
01:24:56,838 --> 01:24:59,121
So when attacking, right, once you've

2541
01:24:59,121 --> 01:25:02,368
given up your position,
it loses its worth.

2542
01:25:02,368 --> 01:25:04,326
So my suggestion would be that we move

2543
01:25:04,326 --> 01:25:07,740
to approach from another vantage point, or

2544
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:12,158
we can just kick this
thing off and I walk in.

2545
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:13,682
I'm fine either way.

2546
01:25:13,682 --> 01:25:14,515
MARISHA: All right, well...

2547
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:17,416
Are we nearby a sewer system?

2548
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:18,299
Scanlan, do you know?

2549
01:25:18,299 --> 01:25:21,335
Oh, I happen to know exactly
where a sewer system is.

2550
01:25:21,335 --> 01:25:24,168
We can try and sewer cross town.

2551
01:25:25,483 --> 01:25:27,900
Or we can just walk right in.

2552
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:30,730
SAM: Where are we trying to get?

2553
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,218
LAURA: To the center of town.

2554
01:25:32,218 --> 01:25:33,729
TRAVIS: We thought about seeing if maybe

2555
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:36,116
we could get to Wilhand's house.

2556
01:25:36,116 --> 01:25:38,237
SAM: Where is that, and
why would we be there?

2557
01:25:38,237 --> 01:25:41,673
Well, that's Pike's grandfather.

2558
01:25:41,673 --> 01:25:44,580
So I know, but does that provide us

2559
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,353
with some strategic advantage?

2560
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:50,236
No, but we might be able
to see if he's all right.

2561
01:25:50,236 --> 01:25:51,916
They've probably dragged
him to the center of town.

2562
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:52,893
How can we get through this?

2563
01:25:52,893 --> 01:25:54,143
Go ahead, Pike.

2564
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:57,035
We could go to the center of town

2565
01:25:57,035 --> 01:25:59,618
and check to see if he's there.

2566
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,400
After we take care of business...

2567
01:26:04,491 --> 01:26:06,481
And then hopefully he's not there.

2568
01:26:06,481 --> 01:26:10,307
I mean, he could provide a lot of help.

2569
01:26:10,307 --> 01:26:12,888
LAURA: Maybe we go to his house first.

2570
01:26:12,888 --> 01:26:13,769
He's your grandfather.

2571
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:15,768
TRAVIS: If we go to the center of town -

2572
01:26:15,768 --> 01:26:16,601
LAURA: It's all going down.

2573
01:26:16,601 --> 01:26:17,623
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2574
01:26:17,623 --> 01:26:21,130
MARISHA: How do we get out of this with the most -

2575
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:24,941
or sorry, with the least
civilian casualties, Grog?

2576
01:26:24,941 --> 01:26:27,544
TRAVIS: I'm not really thinking that far ahead.

2577
01:26:27,544 --> 01:26:28,681
MARISHA: Sure.

2578
01:26:28,681 --> 01:26:30,753
We were supposed to
also pick something up.

2579
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:31,711
Yes, a two-story--

2580
01:26:31,711 --> 01:26:32,928
LAURA: We can do that after.

2581
01:26:32,928 --> 01:26:33,890
TALIESIN: Here's the thing.
SAM: Well, wait.

2582
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,732
The thing might help us, who knows?

2583
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,813
It was a red brick two-story home--

2584
01:26:37,813 --> 01:26:38,646
SAM: Near the fountain.

2585
01:26:38,646 --> 01:26:39,479
Dark wood.

2586
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:40,539
Wait--

2587
01:26:40,539 --> 01:26:41,997
Near the fountain crossroads.

2588
01:26:41,997 --> 01:26:45,184
TALIESIN: Pike, do you know this house?

2589
01:26:45,184 --> 01:26:48,138
Doesn't that sound like the house that--

2590
01:26:48,138 --> 01:26:49,195
That's Wilhand's house.

2591
01:26:49,195 --> 01:26:50,324
Wilhand's house is on the--

2592
01:26:50,324 --> 01:26:52,365
in the temple district stands out

2593
01:26:52,365 --> 01:26:54,385
because it's a small little,
like, red brick area.

2594
01:26:54,385 --> 01:26:55,705
The one that he's talking about is more of

2595
01:26:55,705 --> 01:26:58,546
a classic kind of dark wood
with red brick outside,

2596
01:26:58,546 --> 01:26:59,670
like the way he described it was

2597
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,928
it's very colonial-style, but like with

2598
01:27:00,928 --> 01:27:02,904
a brick base built around it.

2599
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:03,737
Is that not the leader of,

2600
01:27:03,737 --> 01:27:05,706
the guy that runs the Westruun--

2601
01:27:05,706 --> 01:27:07,308
That was Master Quall's house.

2602
01:27:07,308 --> 01:27:08,141
Master Quall.

2603
01:27:08,141 --> 01:27:09,387
Master Quall was just the master.

2604
01:27:09,387 --> 01:27:10,751
He's his own little--

2605
01:27:10,751 --> 01:27:11,604
TRAVIS: That's not that house.

2606
01:27:11,604 --> 01:27:12,437
No.

2607
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:14,138
The Margrave's house is the
one that's in the town square,

2608
01:27:14,138 --> 01:27:15,481
and that's where Kevdak apparently has

2609
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:17,384
taken as his homestead.

2610
01:27:17,384 --> 01:27:18,754
Right, and that's not the description.

2611
01:27:18,754 --> 01:27:22,321
So we have to start this
now, are we prepared?

2612
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:24,704
There are pluses and
minuses to both thoughts.

2613
01:27:24,704 --> 01:27:27,299
They have a bunch of innocent people

2614
01:27:27,299 --> 01:27:29,143
who they may just start killing.

2615
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:30,512
Here's my question.

2616
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:34,679
If we wait, will they ever,
theoretically, let them go?

2617
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:37,732
Or is it easier to just
slit their throats?

2618
01:27:37,732 --> 01:27:38,565
TRAVIS: No.

2619
01:27:38,565 --> 01:27:40,051
Then we shouldn't wait.

2620
01:27:40,051 --> 01:27:41,273
TALIESIN: We shouldn't wait.

2621
01:27:41,273 --> 01:27:42,420
We shouldn't wait.

2622
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:43,547
Then we just do it.

2623
01:27:43,547 --> 01:27:44,890
Those of us with distance, we make,

2624
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,386
we find positions around the square.

2625
01:27:47,386 --> 01:27:48,219
LAURA: We stealth around.

2626
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:49,342
The second we start attacking,

2627
01:27:49,342 --> 01:27:50,655
they will start killing, so...

2628
01:27:50,655 --> 01:27:54,437
He walks in on his own,
challenges Kevdak to a duel.

2629
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:55,270
Yeah, look--

2630
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,103
On your own?

2631
01:27:56,103 --> 01:27:57,270
So it'll go like this.

2632
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:58,845
Everybody get high vantage points,

2633
01:27:58,845 --> 01:28:01,103
so I walk in, I'm pretty
sure if I call him out

2634
01:28:01,103 --> 01:28:04,577
he'll step aside and we'll do this thing.

2635
01:28:04,577 --> 01:28:08,744
If it starts going poorly, I
leave it to your discretion.

2636
01:28:09,895 --> 01:28:11,448
Or if other people start getting iffy

2637
01:28:11,448 --> 01:28:15,281
with the civilians, we
can start taking shots.

2638
01:28:17,636 --> 01:28:19,897
I know I can drop a few
before they do anything.

2639
01:28:19,897 --> 01:28:22,314
I've burned both of my wild

2640
01:28:23,476 --> 01:28:25,987
shaping abilities for right now.

2641
01:28:25,987 --> 01:28:27,100
Unless we wanted to take

2642
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:29,447
a brief rest to regain our thoughts.

2643
01:28:29,447 --> 01:28:30,686
This is sort of a brief rest.

2644
01:28:30,686 --> 01:28:32,676
Is this considered, like, a short rest?

2645
01:28:32,676 --> 01:28:34,117
No, a short rest is like a half an hour

2646
01:28:34,117 --> 01:28:35,739
to an hour of, like, intentional--

2647
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:37,824
We can afford it, we can take that.

2648
01:28:37,824 --> 01:28:38,706
MARISHA: A half hour?

2649
01:28:38,706 --> 01:28:39,843
Will they start killing people?

2650
01:28:39,843 --> 01:28:41,073
TALIESIN: Not in half an hour.

2651
01:28:41,073 --> 01:28:42,506
TRAVIS: No, they won't do it for no reason.

2652
01:28:43,339 --> 01:28:44,527
They don't even know where we are.

2653
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:49,519
MARISHA: Yeah, 30 minutes is nothing
in a hostage situation.

2654
01:28:49,519 --> 01:28:50,624
TRAVIS: Take a short rest if you want to.

2655
01:28:50,624 --> 01:28:51,702
All right, let's take a short rest

2656
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,155
and we'll finish fleshing out this plan.

2657
01:28:53,155 --> 01:28:53,988
MATT: Okay.

2658
01:28:53,988 --> 01:28:55,084
MARISHA: Does anyone else need to heal up?

2659
01:28:55,084 --> 01:28:56,101
TALIESIN: I'm good.

2660
01:28:56,101 --> 01:28:56,934
MARISHA: I wanna burn a hit dice.

2661
01:28:56,934 --> 01:28:57,767
LAURA: I am too.

2662
01:28:57,767 --> 01:29:01,441
LAURA: I don't want
you to waste any spells.

2663
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:02,280
Save it.

2664
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,298
I can use a hit die.

2665
01:29:03,298 --> 01:29:05,159
The Margrave house, when they were

2666
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:06,803
flying over in mist
form, there was something

2667
01:29:06,803 --> 01:29:08,375
that looked like it was red and

2668
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,742
smeared on the outside of the walls.

2669
01:29:10,742 --> 01:29:11,818
Was that the Margrave house?

2670
01:29:11,818 --> 01:29:12,651
Yeah.

2671
01:29:12,651 --> 01:29:13,832
SAM: Are we close
to the edge of town?

2672
01:29:13,832 --> 01:29:17,082
About, like, a five, six minute walk.

2673
01:29:20,681 --> 01:29:22,591
A brisk jog, I should say.

2674
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:26,424
It's close, but it's
not, like, right outside.

2675
01:29:27,474 --> 01:29:28,307
SAM: Okay.

2676
01:29:30,558 --> 01:29:32,785
TALIESIN: That's what I would say is my plan,

2677
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:33,632
if you feel like walking,

2678
01:29:33,632 --> 01:29:35,858
we can point guard you from a distance

2679
01:29:35,858 --> 01:29:39,337
and make sure if anyone tries to attack.

2680
01:29:39,337 --> 01:29:42,471
MARISHA: Well, we should try and probably

2681
01:29:42,471 --> 01:29:44,769
have a few people on
civilian duty as well,

2682
01:29:44,769 --> 01:29:46,351
kind of like we did before.

2683
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:48,473
TALIESIN: Yes.

2684
01:29:48,473 --> 01:29:52,587
That would be perfect,
if you're willing to...

2685
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:53,901
No, that's, that can't,

2686
01:29:53,901 --> 01:29:56,944
you don't still have the house
that you can summon, do you?

2687
01:29:56,944 --> 01:29:58,173
Of course I do.

2688
01:29:58,173 --> 01:29:59,620
Can we put that door somewhere and start

2689
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,229
sending people, if we
liberate them, to it?

2690
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,030
Of course we can.

2691
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,632
However, it would have to be somewhere

2692
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:06,440
close to where the hostages are.

2693
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,294
They would definitely see their hostages

2694
01:30:09,294 --> 01:30:11,416
jumping into a magical hole--

2695
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:15,310
We could put your magical
hole inside of a building

2696
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,682
and send people into the building

2697
01:30:16,682 --> 01:30:19,015
so that it's got, like, double cover.

2698
01:30:19,015 --> 01:30:20,533
And if anyone finds your magical hole,

2699
01:30:20,533 --> 01:30:22,773
they can jump in it, or do
they have to have permission?

2700
01:30:22,773 --> 01:30:24,653
By the way, so many jokes, so many jokes.

2701
01:30:24,653 --> 01:30:27,267
(laughing)

2702
01:30:27,267 --> 01:30:28,139
Resisting.

2703
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:30,205
You're being very good.

2704
01:30:30,205 --> 01:30:31,440
Very firm on this one.

2705
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,773
What happens if you lure a Goliath and orc

2706
01:30:34,773 --> 01:30:38,990
into the magical hole, do
they get stuck in there?

2707
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:42,208
I imagine they'll have
a lovely chicken dinner.

2708
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:44,402
Yeah, 'cause after 24
hours, they get kicked out.

2709
01:30:44,402 --> 01:30:45,769
LAURA: They can leave when they want.

2710
01:30:45,769 --> 01:30:47,495
They can come and go as they please,

2711
01:30:47,495 --> 01:30:48,692
so it's not like a roach motel.

2712
01:30:48,692 --> 01:30:50,264
No.

2713
01:30:51,476 --> 01:30:52,874
Vex can capture one of them.

2714
01:30:52,874 --> 01:30:54,207
LAURA: I can.

2715
01:30:55,257 --> 01:30:57,064
(sighs)

2716
01:30:57,064 --> 01:30:59,652
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

2717
01:30:59,652 --> 01:31:00,544
MARISHA: Okay.

2718
01:31:00,544 --> 01:31:02,756
If we know the city this
well, how far would you say

2719
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:05,359
is Wilhand's place from where we are now?

2720
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,281
I'd say it's about...

2721
01:31:07,281 --> 01:31:08,430
TRAVIS: Mile and a half?

2722
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:10,964
Yeah, about a 20, 25 minute walk north

2723
01:31:10,964 --> 01:31:13,681
from where you are right now.

2724
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:15,431
It's a little ways...

2725
01:31:17,274 --> 01:31:21,107
A little ways west of
Noja's old store, and...

2726
01:31:24,068 --> 01:31:26,705
Yeah, it's about 25 minutes.

2727
01:31:26,705 --> 01:31:30,872
Would you like to go first
and see if he's there?

2728
01:31:38,136 --> 01:31:40,454
ASHLEY: It's choosing between
the people in town or--

2729
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:41,981
TALIESIN: You don't have to.

2730
01:31:41,981 --> 01:31:44,666
You can send a couple
of us to go check in.

2731
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,249
I grab the stone.

2732
01:31:47,519 --> 01:31:48,772
Go check, come back--

2733
01:31:48,772 --> 01:31:49,605
SAM: Wait.

2734
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:51,887
I'm sorry, but we need Pike with us.

2735
01:31:51,887 --> 01:31:52,739
TALIESIN: She can go check,

2736
01:31:52,739 --> 01:31:54,301
and she'll be back within 60 seconds.

2737
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:56,914
She has to get there,
she's the worst at stealth.

2738
01:31:56,914 --> 01:31:58,906
That's very fair.

2739
01:31:58,906 --> 01:32:01,324
But we can send someone
and have them right back.

2740
01:32:01,324 --> 01:32:02,907
I mean, it's not...

2741
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,877
What if she, what if we
go there and we find him,

2742
01:32:06,877 --> 01:32:09,404
and then what, you can
pop back, but he's alone?

2743
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:11,185
You can't pop two people
back with the stone.

2744
01:32:11,185 --> 01:32:12,018
I'll go.

2745
01:32:12,018 --> 01:32:13,368
I can pop us back.

2746
01:32:13,368 --> 01:32:15,836
We can send him back, and
then I can get back on my own.

2747
01:32:15,836 --> 01:32:17,888
You don't know where you're going.

2748
01:32:17,888 --> 01:32:20,465
Pike, can you tell me how to get there?

2749
01:32:20,465 --> 01:32:21,298
Yes.

2750
01:32:23,942 --> 01:32:26,122
I've walked city streets that
I've never been in before.

2751
01:32:26,122 --> 01:32:27,474
We can start getting into our positions

2752
01:32:27,474 --> 01:32:30,159
and then when you're done,
you can join one of us.

2753
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:31,997
What's gonna be the benefit of finding him

2754
01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:34,270
before the fight, as opposed to after?

2755
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:35,103
That's fair.

2756
01:32:35,103 --> 01:32:36,665
Well, unless they're holding him.

2757
01:32:36,665 --> 01:32:37,863
Unless they're holding him.

2758
01:32:37,863 --> 01:32:38,699
But they wouldn't be holding him,

2759
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:39,576
because they don't expect us,

2760
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:40,661
they don't know it's us that's coming.

2761
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:42,900
Well, then he's either safe in his house,

2762
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,182
or he's in the middle of the town square.

2763
01:32:45,182 --> 01:32:46,015
Either of which--

2764
01:32:46,015 --> 01:32:46,848
She has a fair point.

2765
01:32:46,848 --> 01:32:47,704
TRAVIS: I'm good either way.

2766
01:32:47,704 --> 01:32:48,537
We're okay.

2767
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:49,405
Well, so if we cut off the head

2768
01:32:49,405 --> 01:32:51,988
of the snake, there's no issue.

2769
01:32:53,048 --> 01:32:53,881
(sighs)

2770
01:32:53,881 --> 01:32:54,811
Let's do it, let's go towards--

2771
01:32:54,811 --> 01:32:57,030
And he is a very powerful
cleric, if we do find him.

2772
01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:00,660
So it would be nice to
have some extra help.

2773
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,015
He may already be there.

2774
01:33:02,015 --> 01:33:06,044
And if he's, I feel
like we should go town,

2775
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:09,195
because that's a lot more
people than one person.

2776
01:33:09,195 --> 01:33:12,005
Is his house near where
we're going, or no?

2777
01:33:12,005 --> 01:33:12,838
TRAVIS: No.

2778
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:13,872
It's a wide arc, you
have to go up and over

2779
01:33:13,872 --> 01:33:15,504
to get to the center of town.

2780
01:33:15,504 --> 01:33:17,358
The center of town's
not, like, right center.

2781
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:19,117
It's kind of, like, north center.

2782
01:33:19,117 --> 01:33:21,893
I mean, I could mist there, and I could

2783
01:33:21,893 --> 01:33:23,985
do something to get there faster.

2784
01:33:23,985 --> 01:33:24,965
No, we're gonna need--

2785
01:33:24,965 --> 01:33:25,867
TRAVIS: You don't need to.

2786
01:33:25,867 --> 01:33:26,751
ASHLEY: We need your spells.

2787
01:33:26,751 --> 01:33:29,418
Yeah, don't waste your spells.

2788
01:33:30,632 --> 01:33:33,721
Look, let's just face this,
wish each other good luck,

2789
01:33:33,721 --> 01:33:36,813
and we'll meet in the middle.

2790
01:33:36,813 --> 01:33:40,713
Are we going to flank
the entire city center?

2791
01:33:40,713 --> 01:33:43,601
We're going to make this, it's
a town square, if I recall.

2792
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:45,531
There's like a, they've got a barricade.

2793
01:33:45,531 --> 01:33:47,581
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2794
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:48,741
They've got a section of the city,

2795
01:33:48,741 --> 01:33:50,299
of the town, barricaded off.

2796
01:33:50,299 --> 01:33:51,192
Well, it's not so much a barricade

2797
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:53,235
more than they have
short little barricades

2798
01:33:53,235 --> 01:33:54,808
built in for, like, anti-cavalry

2799
01:33:54,808 --> 01:33:58,699
and for any large, like,
siege attempts or...

2800
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:02,074
So we can slowly, we can
start to surround it.

2801
01:34:02,074 --> 01:34:03,742
We can be stealthy and singular,
we can keep in contact.

2802
01:34:03,742 --> 01:34:06,267
I can use Earth Elemental
to glide and literally

2803
01:34:06,267 --> 01:34:10,373
pop out right in the center
of town and avoid everything.

2804
01:34:10,373 --> 01:34:11,282
You could walk right in.

2805
01:34:11,282 --> 01:34:12,115
But you don't want them to see you.

2806
01:34:12,115 --> 01:34:13,098
I would be underground.

2807
01:34:13,098 --> 01:34:15,457
Yeah, I just plan to walk right in.

2808
01:34:15,457 --> 01:34:16,910
And Grog, when you fight this person,

2809
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:19,465
if he agrees to this one-on-one combat,

2810
01:34:19,465 --> 01:34:22,132
is it gonna be fists or a sword?

2811
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,753
I have no idea.

2812
01:34:24,753 --> 01:34:26,286
(laughing)

2813
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,590
Grog, I guess my one concern is

2814
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:29,353
what's stopping them from slitting

2815
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:33,042
all of these people's throats
at any drop of a second?

2816
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:34,709
A warrior's honor.

2817
01:34:35,714 --> 01:34:36,977
A warrior's honor?

2818
01:34:36,977 --> 01:34:39,418
That's weird, but good enough for me.

2819
01:34:39,418 --> 01:34:42,470
And do you think you can evoke that?

2820
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:43,887
I guarantee it.

2821
01:34:45,839 --> 01:34:46,958
Men's Warehouse.

2822
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:49,208
(laughing)

2823
01:34:51,099 --> 01:34:53,414
Just crazy enough for it to work.

2824
01:34:53,414 --> 01:34:54,882
ASHLEY: You're gonna like the way you look!

2825
01:34:54,882 --> 01:34:56,299
I guarantee it!

2826
01:34:56,299 --> 01:34:58,062
(laughing)

2827
01:34:59,669 --> 01:35:00,502
Okay.

2828
01:35:01,552 --> 01:35:03,579
I leave it up to your artistic influences

2829
01:35:03,579 --> 01:35:05,327
on where you go from here.

2830
01:35:05,327 --> 01:35:08,427
Don't be afraid to call your
friends if you need help.

2831
01:35:08,427 --> 01:35:09,442
If I'm Earth Elemental, I won't be able

2832
01:35:09,442 --> 01:35:11,826
to speak, so I'll be relying on you.

2833
01:35:11,826 --> 01:35:12,659
You'll be hearing on me.

2834
01:35:12,659 --> 01:35:14,046
I'll be hearing on you.

2835
01:35:14,046 --> 01:35:15,385
MARISHA: I'm gonna go--

2836
01:35:15,385 --> 01:35:16,856
I'm gonna stay with Grog.

2837
01:35:16,856 --> 01:35:18,170
Okay.

2838
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:19,968
Are you guys bee lining
it, like straight through--

2839
01:35:19,968 --> 01:35:20,927
No, I was gonna say--

2840
01:35:20,927 --> 01:35:22,758
MATT: Or are you, like,
arcing past Noja's place,

2841
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:23,622
or are you going--

2842
01:35:23,622 --> 01:35:24,455
Yeah.

2843
01:35:24,455 --> 01:35:25,332
MATT: What's your plan?

2844
01:35:25,332 --> 01:35:26,821
Are we going for the element of surprise?

2845
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:28,863
Would it be better for
me to Earth Elemental

2846
01:35:28,863 --> 01:35:30,702
and blast out in the
middle, or would it be

2847
01:35:30,702 --> 01:35:33,380
better for me to flank
with the rest of you?

2848
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:35,596
It's gonna go south if Kevdak

2849
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:37,927
sees any of us pop out of the windows.

2850
01:35:37,927 --> 01:35:39,964
I think that Grog's right,
he needs to go in alone.

2851
01:35:39,964 --> 01:35:40,927
We need to be hidden--

2852
01:35:40,927 --> 01:35:42,816
We need to flank and
be completely stealthy.

2853
01:35:42,816 --> 01:35:43,655
Okay.

2854
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,026
And if shit goes south, then we go in.

2855
01:35:46,026 --> 01:35:46,859
Okay.

2856
01:35:46,859 --> 01:35:50,942
Is there anything we can
give Grog to help him?

2857
01:35:52,392 --> 01:35:53,960
SAM: Can't you bless him or something?

2858
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,279
TRAVIS: I do have a question.

2859
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:56,696
MATT: Yeah?

2860
01:35:58,337 --> 01:36:00,670
I can enhance his ability.

2861
01:36:01,808 --> 01:36:02,791
TRAVIS: Nah, never mind.

2862
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:04,213
Are you attuned out, maybe?

2863
01:36:04,213 --> 01:36:05,399
MARISHA: What were you gonna say?

2864
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:07,059
Yeah, I was gonna see
if I should switch out

2865
01:36:07,059 --> 01:36:10,716
the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength
for these Braces of Defense

2866
01:36:10,716 --> 01:36:12,832
that give me +2 to my
AC, but if I wear that,

2867
01:36:12,832 --> 01:36:15,749
then it takes out my natural armor.

2868
01:36:17,165 --> 01:36:17,998
What about--

2869
01:36:17,998 --> 01:36:20,665
No, it's not considered armor.

2870
01:36:21,813 --> 01:36:22,802
Not actually wearing armor, it's designed

2871
01:36:22,802 --> 01:36:24,698
for somebody who does not, so...

2872
01:36:24,698 --> 01:36:26,133
LIAM: Grog.
LAURA: Well, that's good.

2873
01:36:26,133 --> 01:36:26,966
Grog!

2874
01:36:26,966 --> 01:36:30,007
What if I lend you my boots?

2875
01:36:30,007 --> 01:36:32,288
Which, when you put your heels together,

2876
01:36:32,288 --> 01:36:34,341
will also help your armor out a bit,

2877
01:36:34,341 --> 01:36:37,503
or help your chances of being hit.

2878
01:36:37,503 --> 01:36:38,854
Helps me attack faster.

2879
01:36:38,854 --> 01:36:41,240
You can give them back to me tomorrow.

2880
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,676
And I can give you enhanced constitution.

2881
01:36:43,676 --> 01:36:44,509
No.

2882
01:36:44,509 --> 01:36:45,342
No.

2883
01:36:46,855 --> 01:36:49,137
I've learned that my
strength is with my friends

2884
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:51,116
and my friends have their own strengths.

2885
01:36:51,116 --> 01:36:52,616
To each their own.

2886
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:58,401
I don't want you all
handicapping yourself for me.

2887
01:36:58,401 --> 01:37:00,487
I would like to change out

2888
01:37:00,487 --> 01:37:04,089
my Braces of Defense to get a +2 to my AC

2889
01:37:04,089 --> 01:37:05,827
for the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength.

2890
01:37:05,827 --> 01:37:06,766
Okay.

2891
01:37:06,766 --> 01:37:08,132
So your strength is now a 17.

2892
01:37:08,132 --> 01:37:09,342
You take a +2--

2893
01:37:09,342 --> 01:37:10,682
TRAVIS: The AC goes to 21.

2894
01:37:10,682 --> 01:37:11,743
MATT: Correct.

2895
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:12,576
Okay.

2896
01:37:13,897 --> 01:37:17,730
Because it goes to 17, my modifier is +3.

2897
01:37:18,828 --> 01:37:20,985
Would you like some extra
strength for your...

2898
01:37:20,985 --> 01:37:25,152
Yes, remember, Grog, that
mine and Scanlan's strengths

2899
01:37:26,076 --> 01:37:28,777
are in helping the rest of our

2900
01:37:28,777 --> 01:37:31,277
friends and our fellow allies.

2901
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:36,234
So we can grant you enhanced abilities.

2902
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:37,572
Do you have to do it now?

2903
01:37:37,572 --> 01:37:40,686
I would much rather you
just did it on your own

2904
01:37:40,686 --> 01:37:42,667
and maybe not tell me about it.

2905
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:44,705
MARISHA: Well, I could
do it ahead of time--

2906
01:37:44,705 --> 01:37:45,788
Just do it!

2907
01:37:47,019 --> 01:37:49,602
LIAM: Ix-nay on the elp-hay.

2908
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:51,907
Just hug him.

2909
01:37:54,681 --> 01:37:56,187
Just hug him!

2910
01:37:56,187 --> 01:37:57,203
TALIESIN: I push her towards him.

2911
01:37:57,203 --> 01:37:58,204
Give him a hug for good luck.

2912
01:37:58,204 --> 01:37:59,046
MARISHA: Grog?

2913
01:37:59,046 --> 01:38:00,371
Oh, shit, what is this?

2914
01:38:00,371 --> 01:38:01,579
MARISHA: Grog.
TRAVIS: Hello.

2915
01:38:01,579 --> 01:38:03,327
We believe in you.

2916
01:38:03,327 --> 01:38:04,160
TRAVIS: Yep.

2917
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,327
And I cast enhanced ability,
and I give him enhanced,

2918
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:17,262
or I could get him, like...

2919
01:38:17,262 --> 01:38:20,556
I'm gonna give him Bear's Endurance,

2920
01:38:20,556 --> 01:38:24,131
which gives him advantage
on constitution checks

2921
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:27,780
and he gains an additional
2d6 temporary hit points.

2922
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,690
Okay.

2923
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:30,523
Go ahead and roll 2d6.

2924
01:38:31,477 --> 01:38:32,310
Me?

2925
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:33,313
MATT: Yep.

2926
01:38:33,313 --> 01:38:34,869
Big money, no whammies!

2927
01:38:34,869 --> 01:38:36,580
That's not great, 6.

2928
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:37,617
You have 6 temporary hit points,

2929
01:38:37,617 --> 01:38:40,121
and you have advantage
on constitution checks.

2930
01:38:40,121 --> 01:38:41,756
Advantage on constitution--

2931
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:42,604
MATT: Not saving throws.

2932
01:38:42,604 --> 01:38:43,632
Constitution checks.

2933
01:38:43,632 --> 01:38:44,725
Checks, okay.

2934
01:38:44,725 --> 01:38:46,501
MATT: There are no skills
that are constitution-based.

2935
01:38:46,501 --> 01:38:48,862
Would it have been better to do strength?

2936
01:38:48,862 --> 01:38:50,257
MATT: When he rages, he gets

2937
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:51,601
advantage on strength anyway.

2938
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:53,153
Oh, he already gets advantage on strength.

2939
01:38:53,153 --> 01:38:53,986
Okay.

2940
01:38:53,986 --> 01:38:54,928
He'll be okay.

2941
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:56,959
MATT: But, you know, if it comes up.

2942
01:38:56,959 --> 01:38:59,288
Well, now that we're done
being all touchy-feely

2943
01:38:59,288 --> 01:39:00,934
or whatever the hell that was--

2944
01:39:00,934 --> 01:39:02,730
SAM: Well, wait, wait, wait.

2945
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:03,563
Oh, Jesus.

2946
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:07,730
So wait, sorry, it's just,
I found this old joke book,

2947
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:13,090
I thought you might wanna hear this joke.

2948
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:14,088
And I pull out my...

2949
01:39:14,088 --> 01:39:15,729
(laughing)

2950
01:39:15,729 --> 01:39:17,862
Bull strength scroll.

2951
01:39:17,862 --> 01:39:18,782
Oh, thank god.

2952
01:39:18,782 --> 01:39:22,445
And I'm gonna read him
the bull strength scroll.

2953
01:39:22,445 --> 01:39:24,853
Can I affect him with the +5 strength?

2954
01:39:24,853 --> 01:39:28,270
Well, the bull strength, as an ability,

2955
01:39:30,099 --> 01:39:31,954
just gives him advantage on
strength, which he already has.

2956
01:39:31,954 --> 01:39:32,787
Oh!

2957
01:39:32,787 --> 01:39:34,845
I thought it was a +5 to strength, no?

2958
01:39:34,845 --> 01:39:35,678
You must've pulled those stats

2959
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:36,681
out of the old Pathfinder game.

2960
01:39:36,681 --> 01:39:38,052
Oh.

2961
01:39:38,052 --> 01:39:39,845
I have had this for a long time.

2962
01:39:39,845 --> 01:39:42,756
Well then, in that case, I'll just,

2963
01:39:42,756 --> 01:39:45,605
I'll sing you a rousing
song to put you on your way!

2964
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:46,618
(clears throat)

2965
01:39:46,618 --> 01:39:48,469
â™« The stars at night

2966
01:39:48,469 --> 01:39:49,876
â™« Are big and bright

2967
01:39:49,876 --> 01:39:50,709
(clapping)

2968
01:39:50,709 --> 01:39:53,237
â™« Deep in the beard of Strongjaw â™«

2969
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,487
(laughing)

2970
01:39:57,949 --> 01:39:59,587
Take your d10.

2971
01:39:59,587 --> 01:40:00,563
TRAVIS: Okay.

2972
01:40:00,563 --> 01:40:02,883
I'm going to cast Aid.

2973
01:40:02,883 --> 01:40:03,951
MATT: Okay, and at what level?

2974
01:40:03,951 --> 01:40:06,321
I'm gonna do fourth level.

2975
01:40:06,321 --> 01:40:07,154
MATT: Okay.

2976
01:40:07,154 --> 01:40:09,408
And I'm gonna cast it,
I can cast it on three.

2977
01:40:09,408 --> 01:40:12,165
MATT: Three people, for +15.

2978
01:40:12,165 --> 01:40:13,415
+15.

2979
01:40:13,415 --> 01:40:15,903
MATT: Who else do you choose?

2980
01:40:15,903 --> 01:40:17,653
So I will choose...

2981
01:40:19,108 --> 01:40:19,941
Vex.

2982
01:40:24,262 --> 01:40:26,190
Scanlan, how many hit points are you?

2983
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:27,560
How many hits points do you have?

2984
01:40:28,568 --> 01:40:29,401
Uh...

2985
01:40:31,036 --> 01:40:31,869
I'm okay.

2986
01:40:31,869 --> 01:40:32,908
One of these two.

2987
01:40:32,908 --> 01:40:34,001
Never worry about me.

2988
01:40:34,001 --> 01:40:35,317
Does it stack with Grog?

2989
01:40:35,317 --> 01:40:36,854
Get Scanlan, Scanlan goes in combat a lot.

2990
01:40:36,854 --> 01:40:37,945
SAM: Never worry about me.

2991
01:40:37,945 --> 01:40:39,215
You can't do it multiple times.

2992
01:40:39,215 --> 01:40:40,421
Scanlan?

2993
01:40:40,421 --> 01:40:41,980
SAM: Yes, my love.

2994
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,780
I would like to aid you as well.

2995
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:48,317
I really, I don't need, I
don't need any help, I'm fine.

2996
01:40:48,317 --> 01:40:50,175
MARISHA: Just shut up
and take it, Scanlan.

2997
01:40:50,175 --> 01:40:51,829
SAM: Is there some sort of--

2998
01:40:51,829 --> 01:40:52,662
Too late!

2999
01:40:52,662 --> 01:40:53,496
Is there some sort of ritual

3000
01:40:53,496 --> 01:40:56,512
that we need to do together
to make this happen?

3001
01:40:56,512 --> 01:40:57,587
ASHLEY: This happened so fast.

3002
01:40:57,587 --> 01:40:59,837
(laughing)

3003
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:02,910
MATT: And as she says that,

3004
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:04,823
there's a blast of warm
light across your chest

3005
01:41:04,823 --> 01:41:07,140
that fades as she has
already turned around.

3006
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:09,467
However, Vex, Grog, and Scanlan, you guys,

3007
01:41:09,467 --> 01:41:13,679
your maximum hit points
are increased by 15.

3008
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,280
And you get those 15 extra hit points

3009
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,614
for the next eight hours.

3010
01:41:16,614 --> 01:41:17,447
SAM: Great.
LAURA: Nice!

3011
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:18,909
Not concentration.

3012
01:41:18,909 --> 01:41:21,492
Anything else you want to cast?

3013
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:27,277
No.

3014
01:41:27,277 --> 01:41:28,244
MATT: No?

3015
01:41:28,244 --> 01:41:29,077
Okay.

3016
01:41:29,077 --> 01:41:31,868
I tap Grog on the
shoulder and I flash him.

3017
01:41:31,868 --> 01:41:33,305
(laughing)

3018
01:41:33,305 --> 01:41:34,604
Go get it, soldier!

3019
01:41:34,604 --> 01:41:36,930
TRAVIS: I can't lose!

3020
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:37,173
SAM: Wait, wait, wait!

3021
01:41:37,173 --> 01:41:38,548
(laughing)

3022
01:41:38,548 --> 01:41:39,661
Don't you dare die happy.

3023
01:41:39,661 --> 01:41:41,291
Didn't we just talk about this?

3024
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:42,124
What?

3025
01:41:42,124 --> 01:41:43,518
Give him the fucking rock!

3026
01:41:43,518 --> 01:41:45,489
The rock that he can
bamf out of there with!

3027
01:41:45,489 --> 01:41:46,322
It takes a minute.

3028
01:41:46,322 --> 01:41:47,155
So?

3029
01:41:47,155 --> 01:41:47,988
It's something.

3030
01:41:47,988 --> 01:41:48,821
A minute's a long time.

3031
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:49,654
Oh, all right, forget it!

3032
01:41:49,654 --> 01:41:51,033
I reach into my Bag of Holding

3033
01:41:51,033 --> 01:41:54,366
and I pull out my trusty salt lick rock,

3034
01:41:56,515 --> 01:41:58,003
and I kneel down to Pike.

3035
01:41:58,003 --> 01:42:02,209
I say, "Hey, hold this for me, all right?"

3036
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:03,042
Okay.

3037
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:04,111
Yeah.

3038
01:42:04,111 --> 01:42:05,998
Just keep it safe, I don't
like getting blood on it.

3039
01:42:05,998 --> 01:42:07,113
But listen.

3040
01:42:07,113 --> 01:42:09,606
I can't lose you twice in one day, okay?

3041
01:42:09,606 --> 01:42:12,291
Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere.

3042
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:14,399
We're just going to meet
some really bad folks

3043
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:17,814
and we're gonna set 'em straight.

3044
01:42:17,814 --> 01:42:18,697
Okay.

3045
01:42:18,697 --> 01:42:21,082
(laughing)

3046
01:42:21,082 --> 01:42:22,318
Go get 'em, okay?

3047
01:42:22,318 --> 01:42:24,616
MARISHA: That was the cutest thing!

3048
01:42:24,616 --> 01:42:26,149
Now, I walk out.

3049
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:27,477
Oh, God, no!

3050
01:42:27,477 --> 01:42:28,345
Are you guys following behind,

3051
01:42:28,345 --> 01:42:29,235
or just letting him do his thing?

3052
01:42:29,235 --> 01:42:30,489
We stealth, like--

3053
01:42:30,489 --> 01:42:32,239
We watch him leave.

3054
01:42:33,555 --> 01:42:34,565
MATT: Okay.

3055
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,821
ASHLEY: I cast Pass
Without a Trace on him.

3056
01:42:35,821 --> 01:42:36,654
And then we stealth.

3057
01:42:36,654 --> 01:42:38,960
Any other last-minute things
you're gonna help Grog with?

3058
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:39,793
Or are we done?

3059
01:42:39,793 --> 01:42:40,626
TRAVIS: We're good.

3060
01:42:40,626 --> 01:42:41,459
Okay.

3061
01:42:41,459 --> 01:42:42,292
Everyone's good?

3062
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:43,125
MARISHA: He's pretty stacked.

3063
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:43,958
Okay.

3064
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:44,791
LAURA: Ish.

3065
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:46,586
ASHLEY: We can stay close
to him, though, right?

3066
01:42:46,586 --> 01:42:47,708
I like that we managed to make,

3067
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:48,841
like, solving problems with violence

3068
01:42:48,841 --> 01:42:51,586
into an ABC afternoon special, really.

3069
01:42:51,586 --> 01:42:52,419
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

3070
01:42:52,419 --> 01:42:54,069
Remarkable.

3071
01:42:54,069 --> 01:42:54,902
Uh, okay.

3072
01:42:57,364 --> 01:42:58,316
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us

3073
01:42:58,316 --> 01:42:59,207
so we can stealth.

3074
01:42:59,207 --> 01:43:00,040
All right.

3075
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:04,757
So, the rest of you, go ahead
and make your stealth check.

3076
01:43:04,757 --> 01:43:05,590
MARISHA: Ooh!

3077
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:09,515
MATT: Which direction are you

3078
01:43:09,515 --> 01:43:12,026
traveling, Grog, by the way?

3079
01:43:12,026 --> 01:43:14,741
I guess just towards the heart of town.

3080
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:15,936
Just beelining it straight to the center?

3081
01:43:15,936 --> 01:43:16,769
GROG: Not stopping.

3082
01:43:16,769 --> 01:43:17,602
Okay.

3083
01:43:17,602 --> 01:43:19,075
All righty.

3084
01:43:19,075 --> 01:43:20,075
So, stealth?

3085
01:43:21,748 --> 01:43:22,597
ASHLEY: 14.

3086
01:43:22,597 --> 01:43:23,868
SAM: Oh my god!
MATT: With the ten?

3087
01:43:23,868 --> 01:43:24,701
What's that?

3088
01:43:24,701 --> 01:43:25,779
MATT: Plus ten.

3089
01:43:25,779 --> 01:43:26,881
Oh!

3090
01:43:26,881 --> 01:43:27,759
Then, 24!

3091
01:43:27,759 --> 01:43:28,995
SAM: Thank God.
LAURA: What?

3092
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:30,177
LAURA: 29.
LIAM: 39.

3093
01:43:30,177 --> 01:43:32,147
MARISHA: 33.
TALIESIN: 34.

3094
01:43:32,147 --> 01:43:33,120
21.

3095
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,014
All right.

3096
01:43:34,014 --> 01:43:38,359
Grog is not going stealthy, or
are you just walking through?

3097
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:39,488
TRAVIS: Just walking through.

3098
01:43:39,488 --> 01:43:41,001
All right.

3099
01:43:41,001 --> 01:43:43,270
TALIESIN: (hums exciting music)

3100
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:45,781
MATT: As you guys follow suit,
dodging from alley to alley,

3101
01:43:45,781 --> 01:43:47,665
Grog, you step into the main roadway--

3102
01:43:47,665 --> 01:43:49,412
okay, you want rooftop?

3103
01:43:49,412 --> 01:43:50,433
You and Percy?

3104
01:43:50,433 --> 01:43:52,605
LAURA: Percy, are you
going to the rooftop?

3105
01:43:52,605 --> 01:43:54,785
All right, both of you
guys roll acrobatics checks,

3106
01:43:54,785 --> 01:43:58,202
we'll just say as a continuation of this.

3107
01:44:01,404 --> 01:44:02,237
Natural one?

3108
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:03,406
ASHLEY: No, that was a seven.

3109
01:44:03,406 --> 01:44:04,367
Was it?

3110
01:44:04,367 --> 01:44:05,374
Yeah.

3111
01:44:05,374 --> 01:44:07,659
No, I think it was a one!

3112
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:08,865
(laughing)

3113
01:44:08,865 --> 01:44:09,802
MATT: Nice try.

3114
01:44:09,802 --> 01:44:10,867
That thing was so--

3115
01:44:10,867 --> 01:44:11,700
(laughing)

3116
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,054
LAURA: It might have been a seven,
but I thought it was a one.

3117
01:44:13,054 --> 01:44:17,221
Well, regardless, you guys
get but 30 feet before

3118
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:20,856
(thud)

3119
01:44:20,856 --> 01:44:23,106
(laughing)

3120
01:44:24,521 --> 01:44:25,590
Vex, you suffer eight points of damage

3121
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:26,823
as you plummet off--

3122
01:44:26,823 --> 01:44:27,656
LAURA: Come on!
MATT: Of this,

3123
01:44:27,656 --> 01:44:29,532
the second-story buildings, and land--

3124
01:44:29,532 --> 01:44:31,143
I have a broom to get
up to the top, you know!

3125
01:44:31,143 --> 01:44:32,873
I know, and unfortunately, your foot

3126
01:44:32,873 --> 01:44:34,790
found one of those loose shingles,

3127
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:36,098
and you lost your grip

3128
01:44:36,098 --> 01:44:38,271
on the broom,
tumbled, landed,

3129
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:41,098
at which your broom then (thud)

3130
01:44:41,098 --> 01:44:42,982
about two feet in front
of you on the ground.

3131
01:44:42,982 --> 01:44:43,990
I caught it.

3132
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:44,823
I didn't want it to--

3133
01:44:44,823 --> 01:44:46,323
SAM: You are the shadow
that stalks the guilty.

3134
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:48,573
(laughing)

3135
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,686
MATT: So you kind of look over

3136
01:44:51,686 --> 01:44:52,603
your shoulder for a second.

3137
01:44:52,603 --> 01:44:54,436
Keep marching forward.

3138
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:59,903
You get about four blocks before you see

3139
01:45:01,551 --> 01:45:05,662
a group of four individuals,
no Goliaths among them.

3140
01:45:05,662 --> 01:45:08,800
It appears to be two
humans, a male and a female,

3141
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,300
and one elf, and one halfling.

3142
01:45:13,387 --> 01:45:17,554
They're all smeared and muddy
streaks across the face.

3143
01:45:19,529 --> 01:45:22,780
The halfling has their
head completely shaved off

3144
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:24,163
and it has the two kind of lined scars

3145
01:45:24,163 --> 01:45:27,110
over the top of the face
to the back of the head.

3146
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:30,796
They all turn the corner
and look over at you.

3147
01:45:30,796 --> 01:45:34,939
Take a moment to kind of look
for any sort of recognition.

3148
01:45:34,939 --> 01:45:35,881
They look at each other and begin

3149
01:45:35,881 --> 01:45:37,914
to walk forward, drawing their weapons.

3150
01:45:38,747 --> 01:45:41,756
Oh, lads, lads, no need for that.

3151
01:45:41,756 --> 01:45:44,115
I've traveled quite a long way.

3152
01:45:44,115 --> 01:45:47,255
See, I'm part of a
ranging party for Kevdak.

3153
01:45:47,255 --> 01:45:49,508
It's very important that I see him.

3154
01:45:49,508 --> 01:45:51,341
You see, we're family.

3155
01:45:52,345 --> 01:45:54,788
Now, you can either take me to him,

3156
01:45:54,788 --> 01:45:56,871
or I can drag you to him.

3157
01:45:59,245 --> 01:46:02,099
The elf kind of steps forward
and pushes the others away.

3158
01:46:02,099 --> 01:46:04,998
Draws these two thin short
swords from the side,

3159
01:46:04,998 --> 01:46:06,743
they look kind of jagged and chipped

3160
01:46:06,743 --> 01:46:08,969
like they've seen quite a few battles.

3161
01:46:08,969 --> 01:46:12,170
Leans forward and kind
of puts one eye on you,

3162
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:15,742
leaning on the side as he approaches.

3163
01:46:15,742 --> 01:46:17,159
"Kevdak, you say?

3164
01:46:18,607 --> 01:46:20,024
"Family, you say?

3165
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:21,967
"I've not seen your face,

3166
01:46:21,967 --> 01:46:25,566
"nor the travels you've had with the herd.

3167
01:46:25,566 --> 01:46:27,316
"But you say family."

3168
01:46:29,601 --> 01:46:32,101
Don't make me repeat myself.

3169
01:46:34,861 --> 01:46:37,028
Make a persuasion check.

3170
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:40,640
(gasps)

3171
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,488
Natural 20!

3172
01:46:41,488 --> 01:46:43,738
(laughing)

3173
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:50,189
The others behind draw their weapons,

3174
01:46:50,189 --> 01:46:51,518
one of them pulls out this, like,

3175
01:46:51,518 --> 01:46:53,302
long nasty double-headed great ax

3176
01:46:53,302 --> 01:46:55,433
and kind of lets it down to the side

3177
01:46:55,433 --> 01:46:56,788
and begins to step forward.

3178
01:46:56,788 --> 01:46:59,953
The halfling draws this
gnarled spiked whip,

3179
01:46:59,953 --> 01:47:02,297
then kind of like cracks it on the ground,

3180
01:47:02,297 --> 01:47:03,566
begins stepping forward.

3181
01:47:03,566 --> 01:47:06,020
The female to the left of the elf

3182
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:08,912
goes ahead and draws
this long, thin rapier

3183
01:47:08,912 --> 01:47:10,757
that almost has, like, a curve to it

3184
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:12,604
and begins to point it forward

3185
01:47:12,604 --> 01:47:14,315
as the elf takes the two blades and

3186
01:47:14,315 --> 01:47:16,077
puts it out and stops the rest of them.

3187
01:47:16,077 --> 01:47:19,244
He goes, "All right, family of Kevdak.

3188
01:47:22,155 --> 01:47:24,643
"If you're lying, it'll
be fun to watch you scream

3189
01:47:24,643 --> 01:47:27,869
"as he tears the head from you.

3190
01:47:27,869 --> 01:47:29,536
"Walk to the front."

3191
01:47:32,377 --> 01:47:33,627
Lead the way.

3192
01:47:35,075 --> 01:47:36,908
"Walk to the front."

3193
01:47:39,302 --> 01:47:41,730
And I walk past them to the front.

3194
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:42,563
All right.

3195
01:47:42,563 --> 01:47:43,656
The four of them flank behind you,

3196
01:47:43,656 --> 01:47:45,514
blades still drawn, and just slowly walk

3197
01:47:45,514 --> 01:47:48,240
about ten feet to your--

3198
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:52,290
Now I ask you, as I was
approaching this city,

3199
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:54,845
I saw a dragon fly over.

3200
01:47:54,845 --> 01:47:57,419
Picked up one who looked
just like me and flew away.

3201
01:47:57,419 --> 01:48:01,002
What's it like being
the bitch of a dragon?

3202
01:48:03,848 --> 01:48:05,331
There's a long pause as you keep walking.

3203
01:48:05,331 --> 01:48:08,914
And the same elven
voice pipes up and goes,

3204
01:48:10,018 --> 01:48:13,020
"Well, I imagine the gnashing teeth

3205
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:16,590
"of such a beast would
be comparably painful

3206
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:19,363
"as the gnashing tips of these blades

3207
01:48:19,363 --> 01:48:23,113
"if you don't shut your
mouth, Goliath scum."

3208
01:48:26,275 --> 01:48:27,237
You'll be feeling the tips of those

3209
01:48:27,237 --> 01:48:31,154
before I feel the tips
of any teeth of dragons.

3210
01:48:32,781 --> 01:48:34,952
(laughing)

3211
01:48:34,952 --> 01:48:36,732
"Oh, there's many a teeth waiting for you

3212
01:48:36,732 --> 01:48:39,428
"where you walk, friend.

3213
01:48:39,428 --> 01:48:40,428
"Keep going.

3214
01:48:42,037 --> 01:48:44,287
"Your insolence amuses me."

3215
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:47,498
As you guys are kind of keeping back,

3216
01:48:47,498 --> 01:48:49,622
I need everyone to make
another stealth check.

3217
01:48:49,622 --> 01:48:53,789
LIAM: That guy tortures
small animals, by the way.

3218
01:48:55,927 --> 01:48:57,479
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

3219
01:48:57,479 --> 01:48:59,102
Oh, 21.

3220
01:48:59,102 --> 01:48:59,935
24.

3221
01:49:02,225 --> 01:49:03,349
39.

3222
01:49:03,349 --> 01:49:04,205
12?

3223
01:49:04,205 --> 01:49:05,038
Plus 10?

3224
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:05,871
Yeah.

3225
01:49:05,871 --> 01:49:07,788
SAM: Ooh, that's our girl!

3226
01:49:08,901 --> 01:49:09,734
37.

3227
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:12,959
All right.

3228
01:49:12,959 --> 01:49:16,245
As you guys are stalking behind,

3229
01:49:16,245 --> 01:49:17,456
there's a moment where you all

3230
01:49:17,456 --> 01:49:19,313
duck into one of the alleyways

3231
01:49:19,313 --> 01:49:21,924
and as Pike spins into the alley,

3232
01:49:21,924 --> 01:49:23,369
the edge of her shoulder armor,

3233
01:49:23,369 --> 01:49:25,379
being wider than her actual form,

3234
01:49:25,379 --> 01:49:26,890
catches the edge of the building,

3235
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:29,001
causing this large (clang) sound.

3236
01:49:29,001 --> 01:49:32,336
The sound of bending metal
clanging against itself.

3237
01:49:32,336 --> 01:49:35,229
At which point, the troop behind

3238
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:37,729
Grog immediately spins around.

3239
01:49:39,107 --> 01:49:40,690
"Did you hear that?

3240
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:44,633
"Is anyone following us?"

3241
01:49:44,633 --> 01:49:46,270
And as you've kind of
kept walking forward,

3242
01:49:46,270 --> 01:49:47,821
you feel the point of a blade just kind of

3243
01:49:47,821 --> 01:49:50,325
gently press into your lower back.

3244
01:49:50,325 --> 01:49:52,992
Good lord, you're awful jumpy.

3245
01:49:54,598 --> 01:49:57,598
See, when I was last with this herd,

3246
01:49:59,061 --> 01:50:01,143
the mates that I ran around with

3247
01:50:01,143 --> 01:50:02,820
weren't so quick to jump and hide

3248
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:05,807
behind their mother's skirts.

3249
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:08,161
Keep your attention focused on me, son.

3250
01:50:08,161 --> 01:50:12,132
We've got important dealings to meet with.

3251
01:50:12,132 --> 01:50:13,382
Keep walking.

3252
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,230
The blade pulls back.

3253
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:17,803
As you continue to step forward,

3254
01:50:17,803 --> 01:50:20,842
you hear a little whisper behind you.

3255
01:50:20,842 --> 01:50:21,967
And you kind of glance over and look

3256
01:50:21,967 --> 01:50:24,908
as the halfling and the female

3257
01:50:24,908 --> 01:50:26,557
with the kind of hooked rapier

3258
01:50:26,557 --> 01:50:27,791
both break off and begin heading

3259
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:29,898
back towards the alleyway.

3260
01:50:29,898 --> 01:50:30,731
LAURA: Perfect.

3261
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:32,314
SAM: No problem.

3262
01:50:33,284 --> 01:50:34,649
So, as you guys step forward,

3263
01:50:34,649 --> 01:50:36,181
you guys now lurking in the alley

3264
01:50:36,181 --> 01:50:37,817
kind of pull off into the shadow.

3265
01:50:37,817 --> 01:50:41,092
Listening, you hear very,
very light footsteps

3266
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:43,324
beginning to find their
way in your direction.

3267
01:50:43,324 --> 01:50:44,888
Can we wait until they
come around the corner?

3268
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,345
I'm gonna continue--

3269
01:50:46,345 --> 01:50:49,864
I'm gonna continue following Grog just--

3270
01:50:49,864 --> 01:50:51,240
Are we gonna wait and jump them?

3271
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:52,223
Or do you want me to stop them?

3272
01:50:52,223 --> 01:50:53,157
We're all split, right?

3273
01:50:53,157 --> 01:50:54,095
You guys are all,

3274
01:50:54,095 --> 01:50:57,015
are you guys divided
into different groups?

3275
01:50:57,015 --> 01:50:57,856
SAM: No, we're all together.

3276
01:50:57,856 --> 01:50:58,995
You're on a roof, you're on a--

3277
01:50:58,995 --> 01:51:01,158
No, I'm not on a roof,
I fell off the roof.

3278
01:51:01,158 --> 01:51:01,991
I'm on a roof.

3279
01:51:01,991 --> 01:51:03,127
MATT: Yeah, Percy's up on a roof.

3280
01:51:03,127 --> 01:51:03,960
I'm letting them know -

3281
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,131
I didn't want to interrupt that

3282
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:07,524
because it was fabulous, but...

3283
01:51:07,524 --> 01:51:09,811
I've been trying to, like, keep everybody

3284
01:51:09,811 --> 01:51:11,022
informed of what I've been seeing

3285
01:51:11,022 --> 01:51:12,482
and just like, "two splitting off,

3286
01:51:12,482 --> 01:51:14,112
they're heading towards there."

3287
01:51:14,112 --> 01:51:14,945
I'm gonna continue with Grog.

3288
01:51:14,945 --> 01:51:15,865
I think we should lie in wait

3289
01:51:15,865 --> 01:51:17,235
until they come around
the corner, and then--

3290
01:51:17,235 --> 01:51:18,068
(mimics choking sound)

3291
01:51:18,068 --> 01:51:19,257
I'll count them down
when they turn around.

3292
01:51:19,257 --> 01:51:21,955
Okay, I'll wait to shoot an arrow

3293
01:51:21,955 --> 01:51:23,826
until they come around the corner.

3294
01:51:23,826 --> 01:51:24,659
Okay.

3295
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,762
TALIESIN: Two of them?

3296
01:51:26,762 --> 01:51:28,526
Two of them, yes.

3297
01:51:28,526 --> 01:51:29,759
TALIESIN: Two of them taking a turn--

3298
01:51:29,759 --> 01:51:31,127
MATT: I've described them, yeah.

3299
01:51:31,127 --> 01:51:32,952
I prep a Hold Person spell.

3300
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:35,429
Ready for when they turn the corner.

3301
01:51:35,429 --> 01:51:36,262
MATT: All right.

3302
01:51:36,262 --> 01:51:37,095
Now!

3303
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:39,757
At this point, you now see the halfling

3304
01:51:39,757 --> 01:51:43,139
kind of darts around,
whip out on the side

3305
01:51:43,139 --> 01:51:44,820
as the elf turns around the corner,

3306
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:47,139
rapier out with
her hand in front of her.

3307
01:51:47,139 --> 01:51:47,972
What are you guys doing?

3308
01:51:47,972 --> 01:51:49,663
I wanna grab the elf and slit her throat.

3309
01:51:49,663 --> 01:51:50,583
(laughing)

3310
01:51:50,583 --> 01:51:51,838
I'm shooting at the halfling.

3311
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:53,176
Two arrows at the halfling.

3312
01:51:53,176 --> 01:51:54,042
MATT: Okay.

3313
01:51:54,042 --> 01:51:57,487
I go for, you said you
were taking the elf?

3314
01:51:57,487 --> 01:51:58,320
LIAM: Yeah.

3315
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,094
I'm gonna go for the elf
and cast Hold Person.

3316
01:52:00,094 --> 01:52:00,927
Okay.

3317
01:52:00,927 --> 01:52:03,319
Uh, we'll say for the sake of you two,

3318
01:52:03,319 --> 01:52:05,402
you both roll initiative.

3319
01:52:08,883 --> 01:52:10,008
14.

3320
01:52:10,008 --> 01:52:10,994
14.

3321
01:52:10,994 --> 01:52:11,943
MATT: Okay.

3322
01:52:11,943 --> 01:52:13,071
You go ahead and make your attack first.

3323
01:52:13,071 --> 01:52:13,904
Okay.

3324
01:52:13,904 --> 01:52:14,768
This is a surprise round.

3325
01:52:14,768 --> 01:52:15,601
They don't expect to see you dart

3326
01:52:15,601 --> 01:52:16,850
out of the side of the shadows.

3327
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:19,779
They're facing downward into the alley.

3328
01:52:19,779 --> 01:52:20,862
Okay, uh...

3329
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:26,134
I'm going to use Luck,
my last luck of the day.

3330
01:52:26,134 --> 01:52:26,967
Okay.

3331
01:52:26,967 --> 01:52:28,967
Oh, this attack, uh, 16.

3332
01:52:30,044 --> 01:52:31,205
16, then?

3333
01:52:31,205 --> 01:52:32,886
Uh, yeah, that--

3334
01:52:32,886 --> 01:52:35,322
No, that's attack, that's a 21.

3335
01:52:35,322 --> 01:52:36,476
21, thanks.

3336
01:52:36,476 --> 01:52:37,700
MATT: Hits either way.

3337
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:38,533
Go for it.

3338
01:52:38,533 --> 01:52:39,366
Uh...

3339
01:52:42,392 --> 01:52:43,834
I don't want to be heard!

3340
01:52:43,834 --> 01:52:46,157
(laughing)

3341
01:52:46,157 --> 01:52:47,907
7, 9, 10, 20, 30, 66.

3342
01:52:54,349 --> 01:52:55,182
TRAVIS: Jesus.

3343
01:52:55,182 --> 01:52:57,761
You grab her, pull her back, draw
the blade across the throat.

3344
01:52:57,761 --> 01:53:02,334
With a slight muffling sound,
she begins to bleed out.

3345
01:53:02,334 --> 01:53:05,299
Still fighting and
tensing against your body.

3346
01:53:05,299 --> 01:53:08,180
Seeing that, I'll switch
my spell to the halfling.

3347
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,864
(laughing)

3348
01:53:09,864 --> 01:53:12,217
Not necessary on the elf anymore.

3349
01:53:12,217 --> 01:53:14,126
LIAM: Do I still have
the bonus action left?

3350
01:53:14,126 --> 01:53:15,441
MATT: I'd say so.

3351
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:16,895
Yeah, I wanna shove that in her chest.

3352
01:53:16,895 --> 01:53:18,662
MATT: Okay.

3353
01:53:18,662 --> 01:53:19,622
Oh, Jesus.

3354
01:53:19,622 --> 01:53:21,039
Uh, that is 27.

3355
01:53:21,930 --> 01:53:23,390
MATT: That hits.

3356
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:25,057
And that is eight.

3357
01:53:25,924 --> 01:53:27,488
MATT: Eight damage?

3358
01:53:27,488 --> 01:53:30,488
Plus all that poison to it, DC 15.

3359
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:33,680
With a seven, no.

3360
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,597
Okay, so she takes...

3361
01:53:36,877 --> 01:53:38,210
An additional...

3362
01:53:39,822 --> 01:53:41,930
12 points of poison damage.

3363
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:43,798
With that, the blade pulses as

3364
01:53:43,798 --> 01:53:46,516
the poison filters into the bloodstream

3365
01:53:46,516 --> 01:53:49,422
through the sternum
where the blade pierced.

3366
01:53:49,422 --> 01:53:51,002
As you quietly hold her in place,

3367
01:53:51,002 --> 01:53:53,307
she goes still and goes,

3368
01:53:53,307 --> 01:53:55,466
Yeah, goes limp in your arms.

3369
01:53:55,466 --> 01:53:56,587
You, however, at this point, turn

3370
01:53:56,587 --> 01:53:58,268
and cast Hold Person on the halfling?

3371
01:53:58,268 --> 01:53:59,101
Yeah.

3372
01:53:59,101 --> 01:54:00,831
The halfling sees you jump out

3373
01:54:00,831 --> 01:54:03,128
and just whisks her out of the alleyway,

3374
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:04,860
turns in that direction, and before

3375
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,510
it has a chance to react, as it pulls back

3376
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:07,952
with the whip to go in that direction,

3377
01:54:07,952 --> 01:54:09,952
(noise)

3378
01:54:10,984 --> 01:54:13,231
it just stays there, frozen in place.

3379
01:54:13,231 --> 01:54:14,364
That's when I release my arrows.

3380
01:54:14,364 --> 01:54:15,197
MATT: Go for it.

3381
01:54:15,197 --> 01:54:16,973
MARISHA: Go, go.

3382
01:54:16,973 --> 01:54:18,260
MATT: You have advantage on these shots

3383
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:20,307
because the entity currently cannot -

3384
01:54:20,307 --> 01:54:22,857
Eight, no, 28 for the first hit.

3385
01:54:22,857 --> 01:54:23,690
28 for the first hit?

3386
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:24,970
Are you going, like, right up against it,

3387
01:54:24,970 --> 01:54:26,097
or is this from a distance?

3388
01:54:26,097 --> 01:54:27,106
This is from a distance.

3389
01:54:27,106 --> 01:54:28,092
Okay.

3390
01:54:28,092 --> 01:54:29,175
So that hits.

3391
01:54:31,183 --> 01:54:32,961
Uh, 29 for the second hit.

3392
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:34,628
Both of those hit.

3393
01:54:35,776 --> 01:54:37,531
And I want to Hunter's
Mark, can I Hunter's Mark?

3394
01:54:37,531 --> 01:54:38,364
Too late?

3395
01:54:38,364 --> 01:54:39,371
Can I Hunter's Mark it?

3396
01:54:39,371 --> 01:54:40,591
I'll say sure.

3397
01:54:40,591 --> 01:54:42,195
LAURA: All right.

3398
01:54:42,195 --> 01:54:45,112
TALIESIN: There was a countdown.

3399
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:52,596
18...

3400
01:54:52,596 --> 01:54:56,351
24 for the first hit,
no, 22 for the first hit.

3401
01:54:56,351 --> 01:54:57,768
MATT: Okay.

3402
01:55:00,881 --> 01:55:01,714
And...

3403
01:55:04,342 --> 01:55:05,175
God, I can't add.

3404
01:55:05,175 --> 01:55:06,754
18 for the second hit.

3405
01:55:06,754 --> 01:55:08,073
Okay.

3406
01:55:08,073 --> 01:55:11,573
So, both, you know, just a beat of impact,

3407
01:55:12,609 --> 01:55:14,706
the body tenses in place, and you see

3408
01:55:14,706 --> 01:55:16,074
a bit of red begin to drip out

3409
01:55:16,074 --> 01:55:17,641
of the corner of the
mouth of the halfling.

3410
01:55:17,641 --> 01:55:19,236
However, it's still kind of

3411
01:55:19,236 --> 01:55:20,590
eyes darting around wildly,
trying to figure out

3412
01:55:20,590 --> 01:55:23,173
what the hell is happening.

3413
01:55:23,173 --> 01:55:24,252
Scanlan, Pike, anything?

3414
01:55:24,252 --> 01:55:26,790
Can I run up and grab
the whip out of her hand?

3415
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:27,623
(laughing)

3416
01:55:27,623 --> 01:55:28,456
MATT: His?

3417
01:55:28,456 --> 01:55:29,289
Yes, you can.

3418
01:55:29,289 --> 01:55:30,122
Oh, his hand.

3419
01:55:30,122 --> 01:55:30,955
His hand, so sorry.

3420
01:55:30,955 --> 01:55:32,618
No, the female has been, by uh...

3421
01:55:32,618 --> 01:55:34,729
Hard to see, halfling with that much mud.

3422
01:55:34,729 --> 01:55:37,831
You go over and quickly
wedge the whip out of

3423
01:55:37,831 --> 01:55:40,248
the halfling's hand, no issue.

3424
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:43,502
Alright, Scanlan, anything?

3425
01:55:43,502 --> 01:55:46,033
That's all I can do, right?

3426
01:55:46,033 --> 01:55:47,870
MATT: It's pretty quick, it's pretty easy,

3427
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:49,770
it would be like an action.

3428
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:50,726
What do you want to do?

3429
01:55:50,726 --> 01:55:52,893
I'd like to use my mace.

3430
01:55:54,357 --> 01:55:56,110
Which I'll allow because
he's not defending anything,

3431
01:55:56,110 --> 01:55:57,338
it's just like a bonus action.

3432
01:55:57,338 --> 01:55:58,671
I say go for it.

3433
01:56:01,843 --> 01:56:03,843
Advantage on the attack.

3434
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:08,303
OK, 16.

3435
01:56:09,154 --> 01:56:10,471
16 hits.

3436
01:56:10,471 --> 01:56:11,346
LAURA: Nice.

3437
01:56:11,346 --> 01:56:14,139
ASHLEY: Alright, alright!

3438
01:56:14,139 --> 01:56:15,937
MATT: Because it is a
melee against a currently

3439
01:56:15,937 --> 01:56:20,104
paralyzed individual, it is
considered a critical hit.

3440
01:56:22,661 --> 01:56:23,494
Nice!

3441
01:56:28,957 --> 01:56:29,831
18.

3442
01:56:29,831 --> 01:56:31,064
So double the dice.

3443
01:56:31,064 --> 01:56:34,360
And then add the bonus on top of it.

3444
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:35,234
23.

3445
01:56:35,234 --> 01:56:36,151
23, nice.

3446
01:56:37,612 --> 01:56:40,851
So as you pull the whip out with one hand,

3447
01:56:40,851 --> 01:56:44,735
you crack the mace right into
the face of the halfling.

3448
01:56:44,735 --> 01:56:46,900
To the point where you hit
and you have to kind of like

3449
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:49,011
get the elbow lift to pull it free.

3450
01:56:49,011 --> 01:56:51,261
(laughter)

3451
01:56:54,474 --> 01:56:56,849
Face is kinda caving a little
bit, Ninja Scroll style.

3452
01:56:56,849 --> 01:56:58,107
And he's kind of like twitching.

3453
01:56:58,107 --> 01:56:59,440
Still conscious.

3454
01:57:00,378 --> 01:57:03,768
No, that's awful make it unconscious.

3455
01:57:03,768 --> 01:57:04,601
MATT: Not yet.

3456
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:07,599
We have to sit through that.

3457
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:08,432
ASHLEY: Sorry.

3458
01:57:10,595 --> 01:57:13,002
Cannot make any of these
saves for the life of itself.

3459
01:57:13,002 --> 01:57:13,876
SAM: Can I attack?

3460
01:57:13,876 --> 01:57:15,749
You can now, yes.

3461
01:57:15,749 --> 01:57:17,746
I will use the Myth Carver.

3462
01:57:17,746 --> 01:57:18,629
Oh, wow.

3463
01:57:18,629 --> 01:57:19,503
Oh my God.

3464
01:57:19,503 --> 01:57:20,378
Has this happened before?

3465
01:57:20,378 --> 01:57:21,363
No, we just got this.

3466
01:57:21,363 --> 01:57:23,708
I don't even know what, I
think I'm going to need help.

3467
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:24,677
Okay, let me help you.

3468
01:57:24,677 --> 01:57:26,670
This is why we're here.

3469
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:28,847
Okay, roll an attack.

3470
01:57:28,847 --> 01:57:30,453
Okay.

3471
01:57:30,453 --> 01:57:31,327
You got this.

3472
01:57:31,327 --> 01:57:32,452
I don't know how to--

3473
01:57:32,452 --> 01:57:33,484
Use the die.

3474
01:57:33,484 --> 01:57:36,591
Okay, I'm gonna hold the
sword, and I fumble with it,

3475
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:39,523
hold it up again, and then close my eyes

3476
01:57:39,523 --> 01:57:41,174
and just kinda go like this.

3477
01:57:41,174 --> 01:57:42,639
Okay, so the attack gives you advantage,

3478
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,134
but the blindness gives you disadvantage,

3479
01:57:44,134 --> 01:57:46,371
so just roll an attack.

3480
01:57:46,371 --> 01:57:47,391
Plus, eight.

3481
01:57:47,391 --> 01:57:48,808
12, plus eight?

3482
01:57:49,912 --> 01:57:50,820
MATT: So you get 20, that hits.

3483
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,089
Go ahead and roll damage.

3484
01:57:52,089 --> 01:57:53,341
And it's a critical hit.

3485
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:55,253
One d8, so it's
two d8 plus three.

3486
01:57:55,253 --> 01:57:56,128
TRAVIS: That's the Myth Carver.

3487
01:57:56,128 --> 01:57:58,028
It's one d8 plus three?

3488
01:57:58,028 --> 01:58:00,013
MATT: It's one d6 sonic
damage, which is also doubled.

3489
01:58:00,013 --> 01:58:01,556
Do I roll twice, or do I just--

3490
01:58:01,556 --> 01:58:03,086
Not double this.

3491
01:58:03,086 --> 01:58:03,983
You roll-

3492
01:58:03,983 --> 01:58:05,688
Twice, you roll two d8.

3493
01:58:05,688 --> 01:58:06,562
SAM: Double, OK.

3494
01:58:06,562 --> 01:58:09,279
Roll once and then, roll d8 and d6,

3495
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:11,482
double that number, add your bonus.

3496
01:58:11,482 --> 01:58:12,514
It's just that easy.

3497
01:58:12,514 --> 01:58:14,846
Roll a d8 and a d6.

3498
01:58:14,846 --> 01:58:15,830
MATT: The sonic damage.
SAM: That's a six.

3499
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:17,963
Okay, so that's nine, I double that, 18.

3500
01:58:17,963 --> 01:58:19,643
Plus three.

3501
01:58:19,643 --> 01:58:20,651
Plus three is 21.

3502
01:58:20,651 --> 01:58:21,661
MATT: Okay, 21 points of damage.

3503
01:58:21,661 --> 01:58:23,501
As you fumble the blade and cover your

3504
01:58:23,501 --> 01:58:25,279
eyes as you pull back the blade,

3505
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:28,199
the slight humming sound (hums),

3506
01:58:28,199 --> 01:58:30,521
the blade actually kind
of vibrates in place

3507
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:31,601
and as you thrust forward,

3508
01:58:31,601 --> 01:58:35,854
it goes through like
butter with a heated blade.

3509
01:58:35,854 --> 01:58:38,715
You know, you think you missed,

3510
01:58:38,715 --> 01:58:41,095
then you open and peek through your eyes

3511
01:58:41,095 --> 01:58:43,228
and see that you went
straight though his face.

3512
01:58:43,228 --> 01:58:44,673
(laughter)

3513
01:58:44,673 --> 01:58:45,547
GROUP: Oh shit.

3514
01:58:45,547 --> 01:58:46,846
MATT: Like you hit nothing.

3515
01:58:46,846 --> 01:58:48,134
The face, the skull?

3516
01:58:48,134 --> 01:58:49,843
SAM: I didn't mean to, ah, this is...

3517
01:58:49,843 --> 01:58:52,899
You pull it out and it's still kind of

3518
01:58:52,899 --> 01:58:55,275
vibrating a little bit, there
is no blood on the blade,

3519
01:58:55,275 --> 01:58:57,516
the actual like, the sonic
vibrations of the weapon

3520
01:58:57,516 --> 01:58:59,970
managed to shake free any possibility

3521
01:58:59,970 --> 01:59:02,101
of any of the gore sticking to the weapon.

3522
01:59:02,101 --> 01:59:03,252
Oh, that's sick.

3523
01:59:03,252 --> 01:59:04,619
MARISHA: That's so bad ass.

3524
01:59:04,619 --> 01:59:05,493
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

3525
01:59:05,493 --> 01:59:07,347
At which point the spell fades

3526
01:59:07,347 --> 01:59:10,731
as the life force of this
halfling no longer holds sway

3527
01:59:10,731 --> 01:59:13,981
and the body just crumples into a pile.

3528
01:59:16,393 --> 01:59:19,442
MARISHA: All right, onward with our
murdering spree, let's go.

3529
01:59:19,442 --> 01:59:20,630
Wait, wait, are they going to

3530
01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:24,312
know that their two people are gone?

3531
01:59:24,312 --> 01:59:25,184
TALIESIN: Eventually.

3532
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:26,088
Eventually.

3533
01:59:26,088 --> 01:59:27,603
TALIESIN: What other choices did we have?

3534
01:59:27,603 --> 01:59:29,435
LAURA: Can we loot the bodies?

3535
01:59:29,435 --> 01:59:30,838
Of course you say that.

3536
01:59:30,838 --> 01:59:32,242
Before we move forward.

3537
01:59:32,242 --> 01:59:33,279
MATT: You can if you want to.

3538
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:34,112
I'll check the elf.

3539
01:59:34,112 --> 01:59:34,945
MATT: It'll take a while.

3540
01:59:34,945 --> 01:59:36,364
I just want to make sure that there's

3541
01:59:36,364 --> 01:59:37,938
nothing super valuable
just sitting on them.

3542
01:59:37,938 --> 01:59:39,622
I'm just gonna, I'm going
to keep talking to them

3543
01:59:39,622 --> 01:59:41,932
to make sure they know what's up,

3544
01:59:41,932 --> 01:59:43,778
so just talking in their ear,

3545
01:59:43,778 --> 01:59:45,181
they're still walking, walking.

3546
01:59:45,181 --> 01:59:46,054
What's going on Percy?

3547
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:46,887
27.

3548
01:59:47,751 --> 01:59:50,218
27, at a cursory glance, it'll
take you a couple minutes,

3549
01:59:50,218 --> 01:59:53,898
which will put you guys a
little behind Grog's procession

3550
01:59:53,898 --> 01:59:58,077
to do this, but you manage
to find, on the two bodies,

3551
01:59:58,077 --> 02:00:01,494
about 125 gold pieces, 2 relatively dirty

3552
02:00:03,871 --> 02:00:08,038
sets of leather armor, one's
more of a hide actually,

3553
02:00:10,377 --> 02:00:14,825
for the woman who had the
rapier, it's hide armor.

3554
02:00:14,825 --> 02:00:15,992
And that's it.

3555
02:00:17,193 --> 02:00:18,211
LAURA: All right.

3556
02:00:18,211 --> 02:00:19,804
How about on the thing I killed, anything?

3557
02:00:19,804 --> 02:00:20,684
LAURA: You have a whip.

3558
02:00:20,684 --> 02:00:21,559
Oh, they did both?

3559
02:00:21,559 --> 02:00:22,726
MATT: Yeah.

3560
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:25,627
LAURA: Can I keep the whip?

3561
02:00:25,627 --> 02:00:27,662
If you want to.

3562
02:00:27,662 --> 02:00:29,650
Okay, you take the whip
and wrap it up real fast

3563
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:32,369
and kind of just attach
it inside of your belt.

3564
02:00:32,369 --> 02:00:33,563
SAM: Kinky.

3565
02:00:33,563 --> 02:00:37,646
Can I have everyone make
another stealth check?

3566
02:00:45,726 --> 02:00:46,766
22.

3567
02:00:46,766 --> 02:00:47,637
30.

3568
02:00:47,637 --> 02:00:48,511
34.

3569
02:00:48,511 --> 02:00:50,303
No, Pass Without a Trace is gone,
you used Hunter's Mark.

3570
02:00:50,303 --> 02:00:52,828
MARISHA: Oh, then 24.
TALIESIN: 24.

3571
02:00:52,828 --> 02:00:54,256
Then 12.

3572
02:00:54,256 --> 02:00:55,152
LIAM: Oh it just burned you.

3573
02:00:55,152 --> 02:00:56,151
LAURA: Oh, it did, it burned.

3574
02:00:56,151 --> 02:00:57,151
LIAM: 29.

3575
02:00:58,411 --> 02:00:59,390
21.

3576
02:00:59,390 --> 02:01:00,223
11.

3577
02:01:01,554 --> 02:01:03,275
Because the extra 10's gone.
LAURA: I'm sorry!

3578
02:01:03,275 --> 02:01:04,858
No, it's all right.

3579
02:01:07,183 --> 02:01:09,324
All right, you guys move
on a little bit further

3580
02:01:09,324 --> 02:01:12,157
towards a T portion of the street,

3581
02:01:14,298 --> 02:01:18,465
where you can now see
there's a cart in the center.

3582
02:01:20,343 --> 02:01:23,920
And what looks to be a
number of other Goliaths

3583
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,503
are currently pulling two
individuals out of their homes

3584
02:01:28,503 --> 02:01:30,857
and kind of starting to
drag them back towards the

3585
02:01:30,857 --> 02:01:33,579
top of the T intersection where
you guys are passing from.

3586
02:01:33,579 --> 02:01:34,651
As you get to that point,

3587
02:01:34,651 --> 02:01:36,529
there's a little bit of
noise coming that way.

3588
02:01:36,529 --> 02:01:39,320
You hear another clank and a shh

3589
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:42,046
from behind you in an
alley just around the way

3590
02:01:42,046 --> 02:01:45,405
and the elf behind you
has been walking quietly,

3591
02:01:45,405 --> 02:01:48,005
stops and goes, "All rright,
something not right

3592
02:01:48,005 --> 02:01:51,060
"is going on at this moment."

3593
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:54,477
He turns around, "You hold here Goliath."

3594
02:01:56,683 --> 02:01:59,693
No, I don't think I will.

3595
02:01:59,693 --> 02:02:02,096
But I tell you what, you make the choice.

3596
02:02:02,096 --> 02:02:06,263
Walk me to Kevdak or go check
out your little spook fest.

3597
02:02:15,177 --> 02:02:18,427
He looks over to the other companion,

3598
02:02:19,844 --> 02:02:21,527
"Go ahead and gather those men,

3599
02:02:21,527 --> 02:02:23,501
"have them follow you into the alley."

3600
02:02:23,501 --> 02:02:27,042
Then the other individual
walks towards the alley

3601
02:02:27,042 --> 02:02:28,665
and starts talking to the other goliaths,

3602
02:02:28,665 --> 02:02:30,431
they go ahead and take some of the people

3603
02:02:30,431 --> 02:02:32,267
that they're holding by the arms,

3604
02:02:32,267 --> 02:02:33,811
lift them up over their shoulder,

3605
02:02:33,811 --> 02:02:37,355
and you now have roughly six individuals,

3606
02:02:37,355 --> 02:02:38,433
four of which are goliath,

3607
02:02:38,433 --> 02:02:40,418
now joining up for a total of seven,

3608
02:02:40,418 --> 02:02:41,535
and they're all heading back

3609
02:02:41,535 --> 02:02:42,931
towards the ally way,
TALIESIN: Hostages heading

3610
02:02:42,931 --> 02:02:43,796
towards you just run, just run and hide.

3611
02:02:43,796 --> 02:02:44,639
MATT: Where the noise came from.

3612
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:46,720
As the elf who continues to
walk forward with you is back.

3613
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:47,695
TALIESIN: Just run and hide.

3614
02:02:47,695 --> 02:02:48,608
SAM: Do we run?

3615
02:02:48,608 --> 02:02:49,784
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we disappear.

3616
02:02:49,784 --> 02:02:51,020
We disappear.

3617
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:51,893
We hide.

3618
02:02:51,893 --> 02:02:53,216
Okay.

3619
02:02:53,216 --> 02:02:55,676
You guys begin to vanish,
make one more stealth check

3620
02:02:55,676 --> 02:02:57,327
to see if you leave any tracks behind

3621
02:02:57,327 --> 02:02:59,850
or any followable trace.

3622
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:01,167
TALIESIN: I'm not with them.

3623
02:03:01,167 --> 02:03:02,852
ASHLEY: Do we still have Pass Without a -

3624
02:03:02,852 --> 02:03:04,136
LAURA: No, I'm sorry.

3625
02:03:04,136 --> 02:03:05,659
Because I'm an asshole.

3626
02:03:09,576 --> 02:03:10,943
MATT: You good?

3627
02:03:10,943 --> 02:03:12,487
Hmm?

3628
02:03:12,487 --> 02:03:14,571
(laughter)

3629
02:03:14,571 --> 02:03:15,444
I got a two.

3630
02:03:15,444 --> 02:03:16,787
Oh no!

3631
02:03:16,787 --> 02:03:18,745
(laughter)

3632
02:03:18,745 --> 02:03:19,864
SAM: She's the worst!

3633
02:03:19,864 --> 02:03:22,972
I hate my armor! And I love it in battle.

3634
02:03:22,972 --> 02:03:25,768
There's a set you never
quite picked up from Gilmore.

3635
02:03:25,768 --> 02:03:26,675
ASHLEY: Fuck.

3636
02:03:26,675 --> 02:03:30,028
You had commissioned an
armor that would be silent,

3637
02:03:30,028 --> 02:03:31,730
but it never got picked up.

3638
02:03:31,730 --> 02:03:32,821
Oh shit.

3639
02:03:32,821 --> 02:03:33,654
What?

3640
02:03:33,654 --> 02:03:34,487
Ages ago, yeah we commissioned.

3641
02:03:34,487 --> 02:03:35,855
Yeah, I was wondering
what happened to that.

3642
02:03:35,855 --> 02:03:37,745
I thought we had it already.

3643
02:03:37,745 --> 02:03:39,598
LIAM: It's buried in rubble now.

3644
02:03:39,598 --> 02:03:40,893
No, maybe he...

3645
02:03:40,893 --> 02:03:42,121
ASHLEY: I totally forgot about that.

3646
02:03:42,121 --> 02:03:43,432
Maybe when he was dying
he took it with him.

3647
02:03:43,432 --> 02:03:44,479
(laughter)

3648
02:03:44,479 --> 02:03:46,649
He's got it all under his arm.

3649
02:03:46,649 --> 02:03:49,336
TALIESIN: Maybe he has a magic
vault, it might be fun.

3650
02:03:49,336 --> 02:03:51,313
That's true, he might have a magic vault.

3651
02:03:51,313 --> 02:03:52,706
I don't know if that's a real thing...

3652
02:03:52,706 --> 02:03:53,661
LAURA: He probably has a magic vault.

3653
02:03:53,661 --> 02:03:54,734
ASHLEY: I do not remember that at all.

3654
02:03:55,007 --> 02:03:58,044
TALIESIN: I just don't
remember that either, so.

3655
02:03:58,044 --> 02:03:58,918
LAURA: Dammit.

3656
02:03:58,918 --> 02:04:00,901
The thought hits you immediately,

3657
02:04:00,901 --> 02:04:02,078
the memory of like, oh that's right!

3658
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:06,245
As you tumble through
a sequence of small boxes,

3659
02:04:08,911 --> 02:04:10,656
your distraction caught you off guard,

3660
02:04:10,656 --> 02:04:12,327
and you weren't paying attention
where you were walking,

3661
02:04:12,327 --> 02:04:13,786
briefly before you just fall face first

3662
02:04:13,786 --> 02:04:16,890
into kind of a mushy mud puddle.

3663
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:18,116
And kind of stand up and look.

3664
02:04:18,116 --> 02:04:19,216
TALIESIN: Scanlan, you want
to do anything about this?

3665
02:04:19,216 --> 02:04:20,541
Of course I do.

3666
02:04:20,541 --> 02:04:25,268
I'm going to run up to her
and just hold her by the hand.

3667
02:04:25,268 --> 02:04:27,303
Do they see us at this point?

3668
02:04:27,303 --> 02:04:28,702
They are right around the corner,

3669
02:04:28,702 --> 02:04:30,616
you see shadows beginning
to approach across the road.

3670
02:04:30,616 --> 02:04:33,530
Scanlan, the mansion, open
the mansion in a store.

3671
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:35,784
He can do whatever he wants,
don't tell him what to do.

3672
02:04:36,657 --> 02:04:38,433
Are they going to see us
if they round the corner?

3673
02:04:38,433 --> 02:04:39,559
Yes.

3674
02:04:39,559 --> 02:04:41,988
I hold her by both hands

3675
02:04:41,988 --> 02:04:45,523
and I Dimension Door us to the rooftop.

3676
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:48,430
MATT: You've used dimension
door twice now today.

3677
02:04:48,430 --> 02:04:49,773
That's the third.

3678
02:04:49,773 --> 02:04:51,428
MATT: That's your third and
final fourth level spell?

3679
02:04:51,428 --> 02:04:52,302
Yes, correct.

3680
02:04:52,302 --> 02:04:53,473
All righty.

3681
02:04:53,473 --> 02:04:55,221
LIAM: Open the door, do the
top one, do the bottom lock.

3682
02:04:55,221 --> 02:04:56,132
LAURA: Shh.

3683
02:04:56,132 --> 02:04:58,219
TALIESIN: Ix-nay on the argue-jay!

3684
02:04:59,093 --> 02:05:00,833
MATT: As you guys are bickering...

3685
02:05:00,833 --> 02:05:01,707
LAURA: No!

3686
02:05:01,707 --> 02:05:03,790
(laughter)

3687
02:05:03,790 --> 02:05:08,730
Around the corner, the group
steps into the alleyway

3688
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:12,068
as this little poof of
purple energy and smoke

3689
02:05:12,068 --> 02:05:16,235
quickly dissipates and they
all spin looking to the way,

3690
02:05:18,644 --> 02:05:22,561
they glance about, step
in to begin to inspect.

3691
02:05:26,487 --> 02:05:28,725
Spend a few moments, one
of them goes up to where

3692
02:05:28,725 --> 02:05:31,981
the barrels had fallen
over, just kind of pokes,

3693
02:05:31,981 --> 02:05:36,148
looks into the mud, can see
some depressions in the mud.

3694
02:05:40,165 --> 02:05:44,334
"There's something following us, come on."

3695
02:05:44,334 --> 02:05:45,240
And they all begin to swarm into

3696
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:47,315
the alleyway, all seven of them.

3697
02:05:47,315 --> 02:05:49,114
You guys, are you going,
are you backing up further

3698
02:05:49,114 --> 02:05:51,895
into the alley, are you
trying, what are you doing?

3699
02:05:51,895 --> 02:05:52,844
LAURA: I'm gonna...

3700
02:05:52,844 --> 02:05:57,011
I'm going to try to parkour
up to the ceiling again,

3701
02:05:57,162 --> 02:05:59,866
up to the rooftops.

3702
02:05:59,866 --> 02:06:01,219
Acrobatics?

3703
02:06:01,219 --> 02:06:02,436
I'm just going to go backwards.

3704
02:06:02,436 --> 02:06:03,503
MATT: Go backwards?

3705
02:06:03,503 --> 02:06:04,864
Away from them.

3706
02:06:04,864 --> 02:06:06,402
MATT: Okay, so heading
backwards into the alley.

3707
02:06:06,402 --> 02:06:07,714
Can I see this happening?

3708
02:06:07,714 --> 02:06:09,328
No, you two are just on the roof,

3709
02:06:09,328 --> 02:06:11,774
and you're kind of like
"Okay."

3710
02:06:11,774 --> 02:06:13,490
You can glance over
and look on the side, if you want to,

3711
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:15,372
but this'll be the next

3712
02:06:15,372 --> 02:06:17,252
thing you see after they disperse.

3713
02:06:17,252 --> 02:06:18,462
I'm just splitting my attention,

3714
02:06:18,462 --> 02:06:20,396
trying to figure out what to deal with.

3715
02:06:20,396 --> 02:06:23,763
I go air elemental form.

3716
02:06:23,829 --> 02:06:27,959
And into a doorway, into a crack.

3717
02:06:28,450 --> 02:06:32,604
Okay. So elemental form,
you're now kind of this

3718
02:06:32,604 --> 02:06:37,078
little cluster of wind,
just underneath the doorway.

3719
02:06:37,078 --> 02:06:38,767
As they all step in and look about--

3720
02:06:38,767 --> 02:06:39,668
LAURA: I 34'ed up to the--

3721
02:06:39,668 --> 02:06:41,288
MATT: 34'ed up?

3722
02:06:41,288 --> 02:06:42,728
All right, and you backed around the way.

3723
02:06:42,728 --> 02:06:46,462
They step in and begin to
kind of split up a little bit.

3724
02:06:46,462 --> 02:06:48,178
You come back around,

3725
02:06:48,178 --> 02:06:50,790
and you can head back to the thoroughfare,

3726
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:52,875
and continue to follow or
find them up on the roof.

3727
02:06:52,875 --> 02:06:54,020
What are you going to do?

3728
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:57,245
I'm going to follow, so I can

3729
02:06:57,245 --> 02:06:58,994
try to see Grog, but stay hidden.

3730
02:06:58,994 --> 02:07:01,336
So you're going to head back onto the road

3731
02:07:01,336 --> 02:07:03,382
and duck between
alleyways on your own?

3732
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:05,464
Okay, so you can do that
way, kind of essentially,

3733
02:07:05,464 --> 02:07:07,794
tracking back around as they entered,

3734
02:07:07,794 --> 02:07:10,448
and pass them as they're
spreading out into the alleyways.

3735
02:07:10,448 --> 02:07:11,850
Most of you guys are up on the roof now.

3736
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:16,119
And Keyleth, you just kind of
watch them as they move past

3737
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:19,032
and eventually just
kind of (imitates wind),

3738
02:07:19,032 --> 02:07:23,199
behind them.
Where do you want to go?

3739
02:07:23,896 --> 02:07:25,004
What?

3740
02:07:25,004 --> 02:07:26,217
MATT: What do you want to do?

3741
02:07:26,217 --> 02:07:27,050
MARISHA: Hiding.

3742
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:28,418
(laughter)

3743
02:07:28,861 --> 02:07:30,205
They move past and all of you companions

3744
02:07:30,205 --> 02:07:33,203
are currently gone,
you're by yourself hiding

3745
02:07:33,203 --> 02:07:35,650
this big underneath a doorway
in your elemental form,

3746
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:36,523
what do you want to do?

3747
02:07:36,523 --> 02:07:37,999
They're gone though?

3748
02:07:37,999 --> 02:07:40,528
MATT: They've moved past you,
yeah, they did not notice.

3749
02:07:40,528 --> 02:07:41,800
SAM: They've moved on Keyleth.

3750
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,765
Then I try and find them,

3751
02:07:43,765 --> 02:07:46,037
still in my form, but misting about.

3752
02:07:46,037 --> 02:07:48,865
Okay, so (imitates wind),
this little burst of wind

3753
02:07:48,865 --> 02:07:50,098
that comes up to the rooftop,

3754
02:07:50,098 --> 02:07:52,833
and as you get up there, you
can see a couple roofs over,

3755
02:07:52,833 --> 02:07:54,712
a couple of dots, the
rest of your companions

3756
02:07:54,712 --> 02:07:57,233
that are slowing making
their way along the road.

3757
02:07:57,233 --> 02:07:58,287
MARISHA: Okay, I follow them.

3758
02:07:58,287 --> 02:08:00,323
Okay, you guys make your way.

3759
02:08:00,323 --> 02:08:04,461
TRAVIS: You lot are so funny. You
know, I think I saw something

3760
02:08:04,461 --> 02:08:07,283
running behind that pile
of horse shit over there,

3761
02:08:07,283 --> 02:08:09,212
if you want to check it out, too.

3762
02:08:09,212 --> 02:08:11,462
(laughter)

3763
02:08:13,087 --> 02:08:14,634
Silence, no response.

3764
02:08:14,634 --> 02:08:17,629
MARISHA: Since I'm
already elemental form,

3765
02:08:17,629 --> 02:08:20,728
I'm going to go ahead
and start parting off

3766
02:08:20,728 --> 02:08:22,024
from the rest of the crowd,

3767
02:08:22,024 --> 02:08:23,735
I'm going to flake
around to the other side,

3768
02:08:23,735 --> 02:08:24,996
I'm going to start flanking.

3769
02:08:24,996 --> 02:08:26,599
Okay, so you've got to the other side now.

3770
02:08:26,599 --> 02:08:28,880
The bells have now fully subsided,

3771
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,249
all the various warning bells

3772
02:08:30,249 --> 02:08:31,721
that would go off every few minutes,

3773
02:08:31,721 --> 02:08:33,289
just kind of keeping the
state of awareness going,

3774
02:08:33,289 --> 02:08:36,456
have begun to just dissipate and stop.

3775
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:43,234
The elf behind you is kind
of glancing back and forth

3776
02:08:43,234 --> 02:08:45,989
over his shoulder, but still
keeps a blade forward.

3777
02:08:45,989 --> 02:08:49,009
You go past that T
intersection, continuing onward

3778
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:55,122
into the open central square

3779
02:08:56,702 --> 02:09:00,142
on the north portion of the road.

3780
02:09:00,663 --> 02:09:02,369
There's the main central road

3781
02:09:02,369 --> 02:09:03,632
that you guys have been walking

3782
02:09:03,632 --> 02:09:07,702
and it opens up into
brick and cobblestone,

3783
02:09:07,702 --> 02:09:11,869
upward with a slight square
road interfacing the center.

3784
02:09:12,984 --> 02:09:17,067
A series of shops and
tents and on the left side,

3785
02:09:18,885 --> 02:09:23,014
you recall is where Noja's shop once was,

3786
02:09:23,014 --> 02:09:27,181
Abjurist Noja who had saved
you at the First Winter's Veil.

3787
02:09:29,112 --> 02:09:30,315
Not that you guys see this at the moment,

3788
02:09:30,315 --> 02:09:33,563
but you see this
glancing off to the side.

3789
02:09:33,563 --> 02:09:35,032
The door's kind of half open,

3790
02:09:35,032 --> 02:09:36,470
it looks like a window's broken,

3791
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:39,270
and the inside has probably
been ransacked as well.

3792
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:42,246
And as you step in you can see that there

3793
02:09:42,246 --> 02:09:44,905
are a number of tents
that are half fallen over,

3794
02:09:44,905 --> 02:09:48,866
carts that are tipped over
with fruit and vegetables

3795
02:09:48,866 --> 02:09:50,989
that have scattered across the floor

3796
02:09:50,989 --> 02:09:53,584
and they've just been left there to rot.

3797
02:09:53,584 --> 02:09:57,404
There are barrels containing,
looks like rain water

3798
02:09:57,404 --> 02:09:58,353
that has gathered over time

3799
02:09:58,353 --> 02:10:02,520
and section after section
of these wedged barricades

3800
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:07,023
of pieces of wood that
have been jammed into piles

3801
02:10:07,023 --> 02:10:09,606
with giant spikes and pole arms

3802
02:10:10,127 --> 02:10:12,670
that have been jammed in
there as a defensive place

3803
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:15,394
and just to be an ominous position

3804
02:10:15,394 --> 02:10:18,889
for anyone who attempts to
walk into this vicinity.

3805
02:10:18,889 --> 02:10:21,756
And you see, about every
five or six of these,

3806
02:10:21,756 --> 02:10:23,877
there is a head adorning it,
that has been just kind of

3807
02:10:23,877 --> 02:10:26,377
wedge on, pushed as a warning.

3808
02:10:27,505 --> 02:10:29,303
TRAVIS: Recognize any of those heads?

3809
02:10:29,303 --> 02:10:30,778
MATT: Make a perception check.

3810
02:10:30,778 --> 02:10:31,651
LAURA: Oh God.

3811
02:10:31,864 --> 02:10:33,738
LIAM: I don't want to know the answer.

3812
02:10:33,738 --> 02:10:36,262
SAM: Well, I recognized a couple earlier.

3813
02:10:36,262 --> 02:10:39,548
MARISHA: Yeah, you did, I
don't think you've told us yet.

3814
02:10:39,548 --> 02:10:41,161
Seven.

3815
02:10:41,161 --> 02:10:42,327
Yeah, you glance around a little bit,

3816
02:10:42,327 --> 02:10:44,261
nothing catches your eye,
you're too focused on the goal

3817
02:10:44,261 --> 02:10:46,296
at hand as you step
through each barricade.

3818
02:10:46,296 --> 02:10:48,300
As you go through the first set,

3819
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:51,522
already you can see
the cluster of goliaths

3820
02:10:51,522 --> 02:10:54,003
and as well as individuals
that step forward

3821
02:10:54,003 --> 02:10:57,836
and are like, "Hey, who
are you bringing here?"

3822
02:10:59,744 --> 02:11:01,413
And the elf behind you says,

3823
02:11:01,413 --> 02:11:04,830
"Apparently a blood relative of Kevdak's."

3824
02:11:06,885 --> 02:11:08,135
"Is this true?"

3825
02:11:08,135 --> 02:11:10,799
And a few of the Goliaths
step forward and say,

3826
02:11:11,779 --> 02:11:13,076
"Oh, I doubt that."

3827
02:11:13,076 --> 02:11:15,658
And the one on the other side says,

3828
02:11:15,658 --> 02:11:19,288
"Blood relative, the
only one is up inside."

3829
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:22,622
He steps forward
and you see the next Goliath

3830
02:11:22,622 --> 02:11:25,580
that you recognize, this
is one of the older seers,

3831
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:27,960
who has one eye that is
completely clouded over white

3832
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:30,953
and is this kind of
swollen, puss filled socket,

3833
02:11:30,953 --> 02:11:34,282
that has been kind of
perpetually infected over time.

3834
02:11:34,282 --> 02:11:35,462
LAURA: Ew.

3835
02:11:35,462 --> 02:11:39,045
He steps forward with this kind of...

3836
02:11:39,045 --> 02:11:42,861
Thick kind of a, almost
like a moss-like crust,

3837
02:11:42,861 --> 02:11:44,990
that just kind of has
gathered under his neck

3838
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:48,257
and he's called Greenbeard because of this

3839
02:11:48,257 --> 02:11:51,352
weird, whatever
infection or ailment he had

3840
02:11:51,352 --> 02:11:53,994
caused this kind of moss-type material,

3841
02:11:53,994 --> 02:11:56,856
to grow across
his neck and chest area.

3842
02:11:56,856 --> 02:11:59,029
And he kind of comes forward,
using his walking stick,

3843
02:11:59,029 --> 02:12:02,779
this kind of gnarled
branch that he uses and,

3844
02:12:05,567 --> 02:12:08,067
"Is it really you, Strongjaw?"

3845
02:12:09,668 --> 02:12:12,918
I see your eye still serves you well.

3846
02:12:15,353 --> 02:12:17,872
"You know when Zanror told
us that he came across you

3847
02:12:17,872 --> 02:12:22,039
up north, we beat the shit
out of him for being a liar."

3848
02:12:22,873 --> 02:12:24,916
You should have beat the shit out of him

3849
02:12:24,916 --> 02:12:26,678
for being a coward.

3850
02:12:28,148 --> 02:12:30,398
He begged me to let him go.

3851
02:12:31,534 --> 02:12:32,367
"Really?"

3852
02:12:33,665 --> 02:12:36,474
"Well, seems we know at least who's

3853
02:12:36,474 --> 02:12:38,940
caused all the commotion recently."

3854
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:41,839
"Dead man walking through town by himself

3855
02:12:41,839 --> 02:12:44,492
into the belly of the beast."

3856
02:12:44,492 --> 02:12:46,347
"So, men,

3857
02:12:47,947 --> 02:12:50,017
take his head."

3858
02:12:50,017 --> 02:12:52,845
He steps back as about
seven other Goliaths

3859
02:12:52,845 --> 02:12:56,470
from up behind and two
longbow individuals in the far end

3860
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:59,236
go ahead and draw arrows and
begin to notch them back.

3861
02:12:59,236 --> 02:13:00,521
I take a beat.

3862
02:13:00,521 --> 02:13:03,271
TRAVIS: Well, it would be such a shame.

3863
02:13:04,408 --> 02:13:06,357
It seems all of you would be missing out

3864
02:13:06,357 --> 02:13:09,257
on the greatest show of your life.

3865
02:13:09,257 --> 02:13:12,880
You see, in this bag,
I carry the very thing

3866
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,797
that will topple the mighty Kevdak.

3867
02:13:17,641 --> 02:13:19,374
You know what I remember?

3868
02:13:19,374 --> 02:13:23,106
I remember a herd that
nations used to part for,

3869
02:13:23,106 --> 02:13:27,074
I remember a herd that towns
used to quake and run from,

3870
02:13:27,074 --> 02:13:31,379
I remember a herd that
was so proud and dangerous,

3871
02:13:31,379 --> 02:13:35,347
they would never hole up in
a shit-stick city like this.

3872
02:13:35,347 --> 02:13:37,789
But what do I see when I come here?

3873
02:13:37,789 --> 02:13:41,398
Kevdak prancing up in a place like this

3874
02:13:41,398 --> 02:13:45,457
and what, bending the knee to a dragon?

3875
02:13:45,457 --> 02:13:47,457
How far you have fallen.

3876
02:13:48,988 --> 02:13:52,405
Now, if you have any honor in you at all,

3877
02:13:54,309 --> 02:13:57,745
you'll take me to Kevdak
and you will see what

3878
02:13:57,745 --> 02:14:00,345
I have for him.
And then maybe,

3879
02:14:00,345 --> 02:14:04,428
just maybe, you can call
yourselves warriors again

3880
02:14:05,589 --> 02:14:08,089
instead of piss pot squatters.

3881
02:14:10,029 --> 02:14:12,167
There's a moment of
pause, as all the Goliaths

3882
02:14:12,167 --> 02:14:14,791
who are approaching
have stopped in their tracks.

3883
02:14:14,791 --> 02:14:16,875
You can see their neck muscles tensing

3884
02:14:16,875 --> 02:14:18,458
as they're kind of ringing their fingers

3885
02:14:18,458 --> 02:14:21,661
across the handles of
their various weapons.

3886
02:14:22,381 --> 02:14:26,056
At this point, Greenbeard
takes a moment and

3887
02:14:26,056 --> 02:14:28,723
(laughs evilly)

3888
02:14:29,983 --> 02:14:33,441
"You sound like your cousin, Zanror."

3889
02:14:33,441 --> 02:14:38,064
"The two of you enjoy a
night drinkin' in the hole.

3890
02:14:38,064 --> 02:14:43,036
"But sure, you want to go
ahead and talk to the big man."

3891
02:14:43,036 --> 02:14:47,203
"Let's see you say that to
his face before he crushes it."

3892
02:14:51,286 --> 02:14:55,203
"Call him out. 
Thunder Lord, you've a visitor!"

3893
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:02,216
MARISHA: "Thunder Lord"?

3894
02:15:02,216 --> 02:15:06,005
At which point all the Goliaths step back,

3895
02:15:06,005 --> 02:15:10,172
and some of them turn their
blades or weapons around and -

3896
02:15:14,164 --> 02:15:17,174
start slamming them on
the ground in a rhythmic tone.

3897
02:15:17,174 --> 02:15:20,138
(group groans)

3898
02:15:21,018 --> 02:15:22,424
Over and over again, and some of them

3899
02:15:22,424 --> 02:15:26,635
start going into slow
chants (imitates chanting).

3900
02:15:26,635 --> 02:15:28,130
And as this happens louder and louder,

3901
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:29,739
the clattering echos through

3902
02:15:29,739 --> 02:15:33,383
the center of this market
place, this now desolate space.

3903
02:15:33,383 --> 02:15:34,915
Some of them that were clutching people

3904
02:15:34,915 --> 02:15:36,632
just kind of throw them to the side

3905
02:15:36,632 --> 02:15:38,635
and some of the peasants
begin like scramble up

3906
02:15:38,635 --> 02:15:40,381
against a wall, not knowing where to go.

3907
02:15:40,381 --> 02:15:42,293
Or seemingly knowing that
if they were to try to flee,

3908
02:15:42,293 --> 02:15:43,937
it would be the very
end of their existence

3909
02:15:43,937 --> 02:15:45,355
and are just frozen in fear.

3910
02:15:45,355 --> 02:15:48,360
As this is happening, you
see at the Margrave's home,

3911
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:51,634
the multi-tiered homestead,
this beautiful mansion,

3912
02:15:51,634 --> 02:15:53,431
which is now smeared with gore,

3913
02:15:53,431 --> 02:15:55,655
this dried dark brown and brittle,

3914
02:15:55,655 --> 02:15:58,506
the flickering glow of interior

3915
02:15:58,506 --> 02:16:00,440
candlelight catches your attention,

3916
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:04,741
until across the top
floor, you see a balcony

3917
02:16:04,741 --> 02:16:08,527
that looks over the
entirety of this open area.

3918
02:16:08,527 --> 02:16:12,194
And there the dark form
of Kevdak steps out,

3919
02:16:13,531 --> 02:16:16,531
a towering Goliath in his own right.

3920
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:22,287
As he comes forward, puts
his hands on the railing,

3921
02:16:22,287 --> 02:16:25,194
the rhythmic slamming of
the weapons growing loud,

3922
02:16:25,194 --> 02:16:27,390
like this cacophonous rhythm.

3923
02:16:27,390 --> 02:16:30,184
His fingers slowly tense, and the wood

3924
02:16:30,184 --> 02:16:34,351
splinters in his grasp as
you can see before you,

3925
02:16:34,351 --> 02:16:37,648
indeed the Titanstone
Gauntlets themselves

3926
02:16:37,648 --> 02:16:41,816
almost cartoonish in size,
even against his large frame.

3927
02:16:43,027 --> 02:16:46,148
He looks down with his gleaming red eyes,

3928
02:16:46,148 --> 02:16:49,929
smooth bald head, no tattoo adorning it,

3929
02:16:49,929 --> 02:16:52,933
but most of his
entire body nearly black

3930
02:16:52,933 --> 02:16:56,829
with scrawlings of ink for
every single life he's taken

3931
02:16:56,829 --> 02:16:58,662
as he's led this herd.

3932
02:17:01,050 --> 02:17:02,218
He looks down.

3933
02:17:03,226 --> 02:17:05,476
(laughter)

3934
02:17:06,838 --> 02:17:10,338
Into the center of this area, down to you,

3935
02:17:12,504 --> 02:17:15,587
with a joyous smile, almost and says,

3936
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:20,772
"Grog Strongjaw."

3937
02:17:25,975 --> 02:17:28,808
"I would have never expected this,

3938
02:17:30,494 --> 02:17:33,076
not in a very, very long time."

3939
02:17:35,467 --> 02:17:37,278
"I've got to say, I've got
to give credit to my boy

3940
02:17:37,278 --> 02:17:41,445
for not being quite the fable
maker that I thought he was,

3941
02:17:43,702 --> 02:17:45,843
trying to appease me with the ideas of

3942
02:17:45,843 --> 02:17:50,011
finishing a threat that
was apparently left hanging."

3943
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:56,128
"So, you come here, cast
away of the Herd of Storms."

3944
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:02,316
"You have my attention.
Now what words do you

3945
02:18:02,316 --> 02:18:06,484
bring my ears, before I tear
them from your skull, boy?"

3946
02:18:09,394 --> 02:18:10,644
Hello, uncle.

3947
02:18:12,218 --> 02:18:16,386
The piece of shit you wiped
off your boot has come home.

3948
02:18:17,787 --> 02:18:19,861
When last we saw each other,

3949
02:18:19,861 --> 02:18:23,779
you saw it fitting to
beat down a mere child.

3950
02:18:28,039 --> 02:18:31,639
I remember another child
that got a beating.

3951
02:18:31,639 --> 02:18:34,195
Seems like he came from your nut sack.

3952
02:18:34,195 --> 02:18:35,259
(laughter)

3953
02:18:35,259 --> 02:18:38,175
And my, what an easy task that was.

3954
02:18:42,121 --> 02:18:45,889
"Sometimes the easiest
are the most enjoyable."

3955
02:18:45,889 --> 02:18:50,057
"If you let them string
out for a long, long time."

3956
02:18:51,808 --> 02:18:55,519
Well, a regular chip off the old block.

3957
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:59,634
If he's anything like his father, that is.

3958
02:18:59,634 --> 02:19:01,900
So I'll tell you why I've come back.

3959
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:03,331
"Please, do."

3960
02:19:03,331 --> 02:19:05,998
See, I've grown, I've learned,

3961
02:19:07,823 --> 02:19:11,990
I've also watched as dragons
took the mighty Kevdak,

3962
02:19:14,282 --> 02:19:18,028
wielder of the Titanstone Knuckles,

3963
02:19:18,028 --> 02:19:20,278
and made him bend the knee.

3964
02:19:21,913 --> 02:19:26,191
I was wondering, do you also
squat when you piss now?

3965
02:19:26,191 --> 02:19:28,439
(laughter)

3966
02:19:28,439 --> 02:19:31,894
There are a few chuckles,
they're immediately

3967
02:19:31,894 --> 02:19:34,227
silenced at the realization.

3968
02:19:37,362 --> 02:19:41,232
Kevdak, seemingly un-flinched by this,

3969
02:19:41,232 --> 02:19:44,639
he puts one hand on the
railing and leaps over it,

3970
02:19:44,639 --> 02:19:46,002
(imitates booming)

3971
02:19:46,002 --> 02:19:48,601
landing on the stone
platform that makes the roof

3972
02:19:48,601 --> 02:19:53,461
of the initial walkway
and foyer of this mansion.

3973
02:19:53,461 --> 02:19:55,761
He steps out to the edge
of it and crosses his arms,

3974
02:19:55,761 --> 02:19:59,094
and goes, "See, that's your folly Grog,

3975
02:20:01,014 --> 02:20:04,847
as it was your father's.
You're shortsighted."

3976
02:20:07,464 --> 02:20:11,021
"Survival isn't just
chewing meat you find

3977
02:20:11,021 --> 02:20:13,885
and killing what gets in your way."

3978
02:20:13,885 --> 02:20:16,382
"If you pick a fight that you can't win,

3979
02:20:16,382 --> 02:20:20,549
history won't remember a
blood smear on anyone's boot."

3980
02:20:22,649 --> 02:20:24,649
"The dragon was a stage."

3981
02:20:28,158 --> 02:20:30,739
"I've not bent the knee
like you think I have,

3982
02:20:30,739 --> 02:20:34,739
I've merely let it
co-exist for the time being."

3983
02:20:37,244 --> 02:20:41,636
"But let's just say that
dragon's days are numbered."

3984
02:20:41,636 --> 02:20:45,803
"But it's a shame that you
won't be around to see."

3985
02:20:47,197 --> 02:20:51,114
Oh, fancy words for what
I hear as surrender.

3986
02:20:52,828 --> 02:20:54,807
But that's all right, I've always believed

3987
02:20:54,807 --> 02:20:57,313
the world is what we make of it,

3988
02:20:57,313 --> 02:21:00,769
and you've shown me exactly who you are.

3989
02:21:00,769 --> 02:21:04,654
You've shown this herd exactly who you are

3990
02:21:04,654 --> 02:21:09,049
and what they can expect:
to live a nice domesticated life,

3991
02:21:09,049 --> 02:21:13,216
where the booty runs dry,
where the women are scarce,

3992
02:21:15,252 --> 02:21:17,916
where I'm sure there are
plans this very minute

3993
02:21:17,916 --> 02:21:20,833
to unseat you from your high horse.

3994
02:21:22,365 --> 02:21:24,694
But I've come to do them a favor,

3995
02:21:24,694 --> 02:21:27,502
they're not going to get that chance.

3996
02:21:27,502 --> 02:21:29,502
You and me.

3997
02:21:29,502 --> 02:21:36,572
I challenge you to single combat
for the pride of this herd.

3998
02:21:38,246 --> 02:21:40,496
(applause)

3999
02:21:42,349 --> 02:21:45,289
At this moment, there is a long silence,

4000
02:21:45,289 --> 02:21:48,963
as just a breeze kind of (imitates wind)

4001
02:21:48,963 --> 02:21:52,880
finds it's way through
the center of this town.

4002
02:21:54,783 --> 02:21:56,965
Kevdak waits, motionless,

4003
02:21:56,965 --> 02:22:00,351
at the top of the mansion precipice.

4004
02:22:00,351 --> 02:22:02,388
Everyone else looks up to him, from you,

4005
02:22:02,388 --> 02:22:05,684
their faces aghast at what just transpired

4006
02:22:05,684 --> 02:22:08,934
and staring up to him atop the mansion.

4007
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:12,906
He looks down, one side of his mouth

4008
02:22:12,906 --> 02:22:17,008
curls into a wicked smirk.

4009
02:22:17,008 --> 02:22:20,008
He puts his hand up like this,

4010
02:22:20,008 --> 02:22:22,235
and you see as the rows of archers

4011
02:22:22,235 --> 02:22:24,459
that were along the roof
tops of nearby buildings,

4012
02:22:24,459 --> 02:22:28,626
lessen their grip on the
bow and put the arrows away.

4013
02:22:33,276 --> 02:22:35,443
He crosses his arms again.

4014
02:22:38,942 --> 02:22:42,939
"We reserve the right of single combat

4015
02:22:42,939 --> 02:22:45,772
to members of the Herd of Storms."

4016
02:22:47,415 --> 02:22:53,479
"You haven't been a number
within our midst for years,

4017
02:22:53,479 --> 02:22:58,255
since you decided to lie
there and bleed like a goat."

4018
02:23:01,235 --> 02:23:06,488
"But, I can't say I'm
not amused by your gall."

4019
02:23:07,579 --> 02:23:12,356
"So, for the purposes of this bout,

4020
02:23:14,552 --> 02:23:18,258
let it be known that Grog Strongjaw

4021
02:23:18,258 --> 02:23:21,175
is a temporary member of the herd."

4022
02:23:23,009 --> 02:23:27,176
"But the moment his lifeless
corpse hits the stone,

4023
02:23:28,201 --> 02:23:33,518
"he will be stripped of any
honor and fed to the wolves."

4024
02:23:35,846 --> 02:23:36,898
(growls)

4025
02:23:36,898 --> 02:23:40,443
And he leaps off and lands cracking

4026
02:23:40,443 --> 02:23:43,288
the stone beneath his feet.

4027
02:23:43,288 --> 02:23:46,621
As he stands again, "Assemble the ring!"

4028
02:23:47,845 --> 02:23:49,403
And you watch as all of the goliaths

4029
02:23:49,403 --> 02:23:51,195
start grabbing and moving the barricades,

4030
02:23:51,195 --> 02:23:54,278
scooting them into a circular pattern

4031
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:57,874
around the center of this area.

4032
02:23:57,874 --> 02:24:00,338
Go ahead and fetch the
town square if you could.

4033
02:24:00,338 --> 02:24:01,458
LAURA: Oh jeez.

4034
02:24:01,458 --> 02:24:05,365
GROUP: Fetch the town
square, if you please.

4035
02:24:05,365 --> 02:24:07,583
(laughter)

4036
02:24:07,583 --> 02:24:08,583
Oh my God.

4037
02:24:10,794 --> 02:24:12,222
Oh, look.

4038
02:24:12,222 --> 02:24:14,644
TALIESIN: You really did it, you son of a bitch.

4039
02:24:14,644 --> 02:24:16,534
You weren't kidding.

4040
02:24:16,534 --> 02:24:19,292
(laughter)

4041
02:24:19,292 --> 02:24:20,864
TALIESIN: Three days ago,

4042
02:24:20,864 --> 02:24:22,902
we had dinner and he left the sushi bar

4043
02:24:22,902 --> 02:24:24,816
with a big handful of toothpicks going,

4044
02:24:24,816 --> 02:24:26,372
"I have plans for these."

4045
02:24:26,372 --> 02:24:27,769
(laughter)

4046
02:24:27,769 --> 02:24:28,644
LAURA: That's hilarious.

4047
02:24:28,644 --> 02:24:30,957
MARISHA: That's true. I was like,
did you steal toothpicks?

4048
02:24:30,957 --> 02:24:31,895
He did.

4049
02:24:31,895 --> 02:24:32,956
MATT: All righty, so...

4050
02:24:32,956 --> 02:24:34,449
LAURA and SAM: Oh my God.

4051
02:24:34,449 --> 02:24:37,422
It's beautiful and it's
all made out of cake.

4052
02:24:37,422 --> 02:24:40,412
(laughter)

4053
02:24:40,412 --> 02:24:42,554
LIAM: I can't believe
I ate the whole thing.

4054
02:24:42,554 --> 02:24:46,094
Fuck that house, look at that house.

4055
02:24:46,094 --> 02:24:48,033
LAURA: The spikes are facing inward?

4056
02:24:48,033 --> 02:24:49,950
MATT: Yes, they are.

4057
02:24:52,627 --> 02:24:54,354
LIAM: Oh, it's so tight.

4058
02:24:54,354 --> 02:24:58,525
LIAM and LAURA: Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.

4059
02:24:58,525 --> 02:25:00,830
Are we around, can we see any of this?

4060
02:25:00,830 --> 02:25:03,249
MATT: You guys are watching this happen.

4061
02:25:03,249 --> 02:25:04,433
MARISHA: Yeah, where are we?

4062
02:25:04,433 --> 02:25:06,674
We're flanking, slowly but surely.

4063
02:25:06,674 --> 02:25:07,582
LAURA: Stealthily.

4064
02:25:07,582 --> 02:25:10,119
TALIESIN: I'm finding perch on a rooftop,

4065
02:25:10,119 --> 02:25:12,286
so that I can deal with this shit.

4066
02:25:12,286 --> 02:25:14,026
MARISHA: I'm a puff of clouds.

4067
02:25:14,026 --> 02:25:16,017
SAM: I'm holding Pike's hand.

4068
02:25:16,017 --> 02:25:18,092
(laughter)

4069
02:25:18,092 --> 02:25:19,499
SAM: For comfort, my comfort.

4070
02:25:19,499 --> 02:25:21,238
LAURA: I'm feel guilty for
getting in a fight with my

4071
02:25:21,238 --> 02:25:25,071
brother, right before I
got up on the rooftop.

4072
02:25:30,071 --> 02:25:32,904
TALIESIN: This is a great idea.

4073
02:25:34,608 --> 02:25:37,132
SAM: This is the part
where Matt plays dolls.

4074
02:25:37,132 --> 02:25:38,517
MATT: Yep, pretty much.

4075
02:25:38,517 --> 02:25:40,630
(laughter)

4076
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:43,600
All right, so where are you guys right now?

4077
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:44,853
You're watching this happen from a

4078
02:25:44,853 --> 02:25:47,261
distant rooftop, right at the edge.

4079
02:25:47,261 --> 02:25:49,791
TALIESIN: Is it possible to move the
camera to get the house?

4080
02:25:49,791 --> 02:25:51,135
I was flanking.

4081
02:25:51,135 --> 02:25:54,382
MATT: Right, so you are
currently in elemental form.

4082
02:25:54,382 --> 02:25:58,549
Kind I kind of attempt to
actually get on the roof?

4083
02:26:00,778 --> 02:26:02,528
MATT: On the roof...

4084
02:26:03,077 --> 02:26:06,296
MARISHA: Can I get on this balcony area?

4085
02:26:06,296 --> 02:26:07,295
MATT: Over there?

4086
02:26:07,295 --> 02:26:10,158
If you want to, it's going to be...

4087
02:26:10,158 --> 02:26:12,241
MARISHA: In mist form?

4088
02:26:14,451 --> 02:26:15,521
MATT: This isn't a mist form,

4089
02:26:15,521 --> 02:26:17,129
this is your air elemental form.

4090
02:26:17,129 --> 02:26:19,155
Or yeah, air elemental form.

4091
02:26:19,155 --> 02:26:21,675
But I can move through things.

4092
02:26:21,675 --> 02:26:23,565
MATT: You can, so you can...

4093
02:26:23,565 --> 02:26:25,815
Super, super, super thin.

4094
02:26:26,823 --> 02:26:28,344
MATT: Right, so you want
to just glide into like,

4095
02:26:28,344 --> 02:26:30,244
part of the stonework over here, or...

4096
02:26:30,244 --> 02:26:31,351
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

4097
02:26:31,351 --> 02:26:32,440
All righty.

4098
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:35,123
So at this time, as everyone assembles

4099
02:26:35,123 --> 02:26:37,115
all the spikes inward
in a circle position,

4100
02:26:37,115 --> 02:26:39,678
and you stand in place, Kevdak walks into

4101
02:26:39,678 --> 02:26:43,103
the center of the ring,
he takes the gauntlets,

4102
02:26:43,103 --> 02:26:47,399
puts a hand out, and one
of the Goliaths comes up

4103
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:50,396
and takes a weapon that you
haven't seen in a while,

4104
02:26:50,396 --> 02:26:56,753
this dark red rust-colored ax
is placed into his one hand,

4105
02:26:56,762 --> 02:27:00,012
as the gauntlet grips around it,

4106
02:27:00,012 --> 02:27:02,461
taking the Blood Ax in his hand,

4107
02:27:02,461 --> 02:27:06,461
he closes his other fist
and slams them together

4108
02:27:07,347 --> 02:27:10,235
and as he slams them together
with a sound of metal,

4109
02:27:10,235 --> 02:27:13,038
his form warps and grows.

4110
02:27:15,043 --> 02:27:16,889
And what was once already Kevdak,

4111
02:27:16,889 --> 02:27:21,570
who held a good four to
five inches on your height,

4112
02:27:21,570 --> 02:27:23,987
swells to about 12 feet tall.

4113
02:27:25,139 --> 02:27:27,106
MARISHA: Excuse me?

4114
02:27:27,106 --> 02:27:27,939
Oh shit.

4115
02:27:30,233 --> 02:27:31,704
SAM: Wait, Kevdak just grew?

4116
02:27:31,704 --> 02:27:32,576
Yes.

4117
02:27:32,576 --> 02:27:33,450
LAURA: Kevdak just grew.

4118
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:34,950
SAM: Oh my God.

4119
02:27:36,425 --> 02:27:37,576
MARISHA: Holy shit.

4120
02:27:37,576 --> 02:27:38,677
TALIESIN: Ashley or Pike?

4121
02:27:38,677 --> 02:27:43,313
MATT: So, whereabouts are
you guys at this moment?

4122
02:27:43,313 --> 02:27:44,583
Just give me some inclination.

4123
02:27:44,583 --> 02:27:48,365
Keyleth is over there,
keeping relatively hidden,

4124
02:27:48,365 --> 02:27:51,014
as an air elemental, I need
you to make a stealth check

4125
02:27:51,014 --> 02:27:54,264
as part of that, see if you're noticed.

4126
02:27:55,673 --> 02:27:56,829
Natural 20.

4127
02:27:56,829 --> 02:27:57,703
GROUP: Yes!

4128
02:27:57,703 --> 02:27:59,394
MATT: That I like.

4129
02:27:59,394 --> 02:28:01,167
Figure out where you're hiding.

4130
02:28:01,167 --> 02:28:03,401
Are we coming from behind
there or from this side?

4131
02:28:03,401 --> 02:28:07,568
MATT: This, you guys would be coming
from this direction here.

4132
02:28:10,085 --> 02:28:12,349
TALIESIN: I'll take the 3 o'clock,
if the house is 12,

4133
02:28:12,349 --> 02:28:13,499
I'll take the 3 o'clock.

4134
02:28:13,499 --> 02:28:14,782
MATT: So you'll be kind of up in this--

4135
02:28:14,782 --> 02:28:15,726
Over there.

4136
02:28:15,726 --> 02:28:16,797
MATT: Over here?

4137
02:28:16,797 --> 02:28:21,193
Okay, so we'll say Percy
is up on the roof area.

4138
02:28:21,193 --> 02:28:25,026
TALIESIN: 6 o'clock,
9 o'clock, 12 o'clock.

4139
02:28:25,916 --> 02:28:27,841
Okay, I need you to go ahead and
roll stealth check as well,

4140
02:28:27,841 --> 02:28:30,546
as you move up there,
make sure you're not seen.

4141
02:28:30,546 --> 02:28:31,419
Where are the rest of you?

4142
02:28:31,419 --> 02:28:32,295
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

4143
02:28:32,295 --> 02:28:34,956
(cheering)

4144
02:28:34,956 --> 02:28:38,206
LAURA: Is there a roof in this area?

4145
02:28:40,455 --> 02:28:41,288
MATT: There is.

4146
02:28:43,182 --> 02:28:44,854
I'm going to put this
off to the side there,

4147
02:28:44,854 --> 02:28:48,771
if you'd like to maneuver
in this area as well.

4148
02:28:52,289 --> 02:28:53,504
For those who want to be on this side.

4149
02:28:53,504 --> 02:28:56,541
Who wants to be up there with Vex?

4150
02:28:56,541 --> 02:28:57,905
ASHLEY: Should we dimension door up there?

4151
02:28:57,905 --> 02:28:59,295
SAM: Well, we've been...

4152
02:28:59,295 --> 02:29:01,287
You guys have been following
to get to this area.

4153
02:29:01,287 --> 02:29:02,547
SAM: We've been following wherever.

4154
02:29:02,547 --> 02:29:04,189
You guys want to be up there with Vex?

4155
02:29:04,189 --> 02:29:06,798
SAM: We probably went up
with Vex, probably, yeah.

4156
02:29:06,798 --> 02:29:08,402
We don't know what we're doing.

4157
02:29:08,402 --> 02:29:09,428
Okay. Vax, where are you?

4158
02:29:09,428 --> 02:29:11,308
LIAM: I guess I'm maybe off by that

4159
02:29:11,308 --> 02:29:13,684
fountain in the corner of your map.

4160
02:29:13,684 --> 02:29:14,557
Over there?

4161
02:29:14,557 --> 02:29:16,986
This is an open area over here.

4162
02:29:16,986 --> 02:29:17,860
LIAM: That's all open?

4163
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:19,400
This is all open, this is the
center of the town square.

4164
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:20,558
LIAM: Then I would be at the bottom

4165
02:29:20,558 --> 02:29:22,133
of the building that Vex is in.

4166
02:29:22,133 --> 02:29:23,635
Okay, so you're kind of close down,

4167
02:29:23,635 --> 02:29:25,283
like kind of looking through the window

4168
02:29:25,283 --> 02:29:26,211
out into the main thoroughfare.

4169
02:29:26,211 --> 02:29:27,444
Okay, good to know.

4170
02:29:27,444 --> 02:29:31,611
So, Grog. With this,

4171
02:29:33,027 --> 02:29:36,027
I want you to roll initiative.

4172
02:29:39,443 --> 02:29:41,110
MARISHA: Oh my God.

4173
02:29:42,791 --> 02:29:46,120
LAURA: Can I take Trinket out of the -

4174
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:48,096
If you'd like to, yeah, do you want to?

4175
02:29:48,096 --> 02:29:48,929
Your call.

4176
02:29:50,283 --> 02:29:51,883
SAM: Trinket's going to make some noise.

4177
02:29:51,883 --> 02:29:52,756
Initiative?

4178
02:29:52,756 --> 02:29:53,630
TRAVIS: 17.

4179
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:54,831
17.

4180
02:29:54,831 --> 02:29:57,581
(dramatic music)

4181
02:30:03,856 --> 02:30:06,356
As you guys begin this fray...

4182
02:30:07,946 --> 02:30:10,922
No Trinket, yes Trinket,
what are you doing?

4183
02:30:10,922 --> 02:30:12,113
Trinket is staying in.

4184
02:30:12,113 --> 02:30:13,435
MATT: All right.

4185
02:30:13,435 --> 02:30:16,435
You, as Kevdak takes on a large form,

4186
02:30:16,435 --> 02:30:19,810
the blood ax swelling with his size,

4187
02:30:19,810 --> 02:30:23,384
gets into a combat position and he says,

4188
02:30:23,384 --> 02:30:26,801
"Show me what you've learned, Strongjaw."

4189
02:30:27,658 --> 02:30:30,446
You're going first, you
beat him on initiative.

4190
02:30:30,446 --> 02:30:31,320
Go for it.

4191
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:33,570
LAURA: Jesus.

4192
02:30:36,171 --> 02:30:40,338
I would like to rage the
rage of my rage-y life.

4193
02:30:40,338 --> 02:30:42,683
(laughter)

4194
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:48,326
And I would like to use
intimidating presence on Kevdak.

4195
02:30:49,292 --> 02:30:50,125
Okay.

4196
02:30:51,324 --> 02:30:52,692
SAM: That's a risk.

4197
02:30:52,692 --> 02:30:53,878
(laughter)

4198
02:30:53,878 --> 02:30:57,295
MATT: All right, so that's your action on that.

4199
02:31:01,008 --> 02:31:03,425
So what's the DC on that one?

4200
02:31:03,757 --> 02:31:04,631
TRAVIS: 18.

4201
02:31:04,631 --> 02:31:06,385
MATT: And what's the save?

4202
02:31:06,385 --> 02:31:10,468
TRAVIS: Oh,
17 is the wisdom saving throw.

4203
02:31:13,599 --> 02:31:17,766
For that one, do you
remember if that one is a--

4204
02:31:22,426 --> 02:31:25,415
TRAVIS: It says within 30 feet frighten
until end of next turn,

4205
02:31:25,415 --> 02:31:28,332
wisdom saving throw.

4206
02:31:30,046 --> 02:31:32,926
MATT: Yeah, okay. So as you glare, how
do you go about this glare,

4207
02:31:32,926 --> 02:31:35,922
what do you do to intimidate him?

4208
02:31:35,922 --> 02:31:38,339
I go into a rage.

4209
02:31:38,339 --> 02:31:41,355
And with my flaming war
hammer, I grab the end of the

4210
02:31:41,355 --> 02:31:45,226
hammer and let it cook
my flesh for a minute

4211
02:31:45,226 --> 02:31:47,303
and then I smack myself on the chest

4212
02:31:47,303 --> 02:31:50,062
and rip out the biggest bellow I have.

4213
02:31:50,062 --> 02:31:54,265
As you do, Kevdak goes
to take a step forward,

4214
02:31:54,265 --> 02:31:57,417
takes the single step, hesitates,

4215
02:31:57,417 --> 02:31:59,326
seems to just hold his ground.

4216
02:31:59,326 --> 02:32:03,493
Eyeing you down and seemingly
not expecting this ferocity.

4217
02:32:09,866 --> 02:32:12,210
All righty, that's your
action and your bonus.

4218
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:13,653
Are you going to move,

4219
02:32:13,653 --> 02:32:16,696
or are you going to stay where you are?

4220
02:32:16,696 --> 02:32:18,516
There are no openings in the ring, right?

4221
02:32:18,516 --> 02:32:19,389
MATT: Nope.

4222
02:32:19,389 --> 02:32:21,027
SAM: You had inspiration, by the way,

4223
02:32:21,027 --> 02:32:22,536
would that have helped at all?

4224
02:32:22,536 --> 02:32:24,930
There are side openings, like areas here,

4225
02:32:24,930 --> 02:32:27,541
where you could step out,
but you get the sense that,

4226
02:32:27,541 --> 02:32:29,356
as people are gathering around,

4227
02:32:29,356 --> 02:32:33,814
they would be plugging
elements of this exit,

4228
02:32:33,814 --> 02:32:35,647
to prevent you from...

4229
02:32:37,769 --> 02:32:39,825
closing the gap.

4230
02:32:39,825 --> 02:32:42,908
With my bonus action I yell "Coward!"

4231
02:32:43,785 --> 02:32:45,770
And that's it.

4232
02:32:45,770 --> 02:32:47,950
MATT: Okay. Technically the
rage is the bonus action,

4233
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:49,633
but you can shout that for free.

4234
02:32:49,633 --> 02:32:51,477
Yeah, that's fine.

4235
02:32:51,477 --> 02:32:52,739
All right, so for Kevdak's turn,

4236
02:32:52,739 --> 02:32:55,989
Kevdak kind of realizing that he can't,

4237
02:32:58,029 --> 02:33:01,707
he's not able to really
move closer at this moment,

4238
02:33:01,707 --> 02:33:06,402
kind of steps to the side here,
guarding, kind of waiting...

4239
02:33:06,402 --> 02:33:10,569
LIAM: His version of
fear was not digging in.

4240
02:33:17,194 --> 02:33:20,134
MATT: Yeah, he's going to go ahead
and take a bonus action

4241
02:33:20,134 --> 02:33:22,644
to go into his own rage.

4242
02:33:28,278 --> 02:33:30,307
I just had to try and make
it work at least once.

4243
02:33:30,307 --> 02:33:31,642
SAM: It worked.

4244
02:33:31,642 --> 02:33:32,655
TRAVIS: And it did.

4245
02:33:33,626 --> 02:33:35,252
Hey man, at least I can say

4246
02:33:35,252 --> 02:33:37,006
I didn't die without it working once.

4247
02:33:37,006 --> 02:33:38,268
LAURA: Don't say that!

4248
02:33:38,268 --> 02:33:39,380
ASHLEY: You're not going to die, Grog.

4249
02:33:40,254 --> 02:33:42,288
So Kevdak goes into his own rage,

4250
02:33:42,288 --> 02:33:45,507
as Kevdak goes into a rage, screaming out.

4251
02:33:45,507 --> 02:33:48,015
(growls)

4252
02:33:48,015 --> 02:33:50,538
The ground shakes and little stones and rocks

4253
02:33:50,538 --> 02:33:53,408
scatter across the stonework
from the vibration of it.

4254
02:33:53,408 --> 02:33:55,185
And you see some of those tattoos,

4255
02:33:55,185 --> 02:33:57,479
the black ink that goes across his chest,

4256
02:33:57,479 --> 02:33:59,680
you see what looks like a bear

4257
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:01,637
that is hidden within the tattoo,

4258
02:34:01,637 --> 02:34:06,261
that flares up with a flash of
dark, deep red crimson energy

4259
02:34:06,261 --> 02:34:08,393
and then fades back into the chest.

4260
02:34:08,393 --> 02:34:09,382
LAURA: What?

4261
02:34:09,382 --> 02:34:11,058
TALIESIN: 1984 with it.

4262
02:34:11,058 --> 02:34:13,202
MATT: You're up Grog.

4263
02:34:13,202 --> 02:34:14,035
Raging.

4264
02:34:18,688 --> 02:34:22,688
I'll go into a frenzied rage
and I charge headlong

4265
02:34:24,837 --> 02:34:28,381
into Kevdak with my firebrand war hammer.

4266
02:34:28,381 --> 02:34:29,926
MATT: All right.

4267
02:34:29,926 --> 02:34:34,009
Actually, he backed up
against the ring, right?

4268
02:34:34,968 --> 02:34:36,788
(group excitedly exclaims)

4269
02:34:36,788 --> 02:34:37,725
MATT: He's backed up against the edge

4270
02:34:37,725 --> 02:34:39,539
of one of the openings, but
if you want to go from here...

4271
02:34:39,539 --> 02:34:42,008
But there's large
point-ies behind him right?

4272
02:34:42,008 --> 02:34:43,140
MATT: At one angle, yeah.

4273
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:46,061
I'd like to drive my head
right into his chest.

4274
02:34:46,061 --> 02:34:48,462
Can I move into him hard,

4275
02:34:48,462 --> 02:34:51,272
see if I can push him back
against one of the spikes?

4276
02:34:51,272 --> 02:34:53,297
I'll say sure.

4277
02:34:53,297 --> 02:34:55,383
I still have, if I'm frenzy-ing,

4278
02:34:55,383 --> 02:34:57,569
would I still have two attacks after that?

4279
02:34:57,569 --> 02:34:59,506
That would be your action, to do that,

4280
02:34:59,506 --> 02:35:02,828
so you would have your bonus
action of you wanted to.

4281
02:35:02,828 --> 02:35:04,886
I'll just run up to him
and hit him three times.

4282
02:35:04,886 --> 02:35:06,219
Okay, go for it.

4283
02:35:10,895 --> 02:35:13,327
Yeah, the first two are just normal.

4284
02:35:13,327 --> 02:35:15,577
I'll just roll these first.

4285
02:35:17,073 --> 02:35:18,360
27.

4286
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:19,360
That hits.

4287
02:35:22,755 --> 02:35:23,913
24.

4288
02:35:23,913 --> 02:35:24,746
Hits.

4289
02:35:28,692 --> 02:35:29,704
16.

4290
02:35:29,704 --> 02:35:30,734
Misses.

4291
02:35:30,734 --> 02:35:31,948
ASHLEY: War God's blessing?

4292
02:35:31,948 --> 02:35:33,023
MATT: What's the range on that?

4293
02:35:33,023 --> 02:35:35,456
LAURA: Oh and you have inspiration, that's right.

4294
02:35:35,456 --> 02:35:38,648
TALIESIN: Yeah, but this may not
be the moment though.

4295
02:35:39,278 --> 02:35:40,881
SAM: I've got more.

4296
02:35:40,889 --> 02:35:41,952
TALIESIN: It's early.

4297
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:44,609
ASHLEY: Where the fuck is my thing?

4298
02:35:44,609 --> 02:35:47,887
Oh, it's right in front of me.

4299
02:35:47,887 --> 02:35:49,517
Unfortunately inspiration
fades in ten minutes.

4300
02:35:49,517 --> 02:35:50,769
ASHLEY: 30 feet, so...

4301
02:35:50,769 --> 02:35:51,951
30 feet, yeah, that's too far away

4302
02:35:51,951 --> 02:35:53,493
for War God's Blessing.

4303
02:35:53,493 --> 02:35:56,092
So the first two strikes, go
ahead and roll for damage.

4304
02:35:56,092 --> 02:35:57,034
TRAVIS: Okay.

4305
02:35:57,034 --> 02:35:58,201
They do hit.

4306
02:35:59,519 --> 02:36:00,642
Where the fuck is it?

4307
02:36:00,642 --> 02:36:01,975
Oh, there it is.

4308
02:36:03,612 --> 02:36:06,029
10, 15, 23, 23, oh 23 plus...

4309
02:36:09,907 --> 02:36:13,592
Five, so 28 with the fire
damage on the first one.

4310
02:36:13,592 --> 02:36:15,342
And the second one...

4311
02:36:20,103 --> 02:36:20,936
17.

4312
02:36:22,067 --> 02:36:22,900
17, okay.

4313
02:36:25,947 --> 02:36:29,363
As you slam, whack, whack,
with the flaming war hammer,

4314
02:36:29,363 --> 02:36:33,100
twice into the oversize Kevdak's chest,

4315
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:36,251
each hit hits, but Kevdak is
just barely pushed back by each

4316
02:36:36,251 --> 02:36:40,418
and the damage, even the fire
damage, seems to be taken

4317
02:36:41,821 --> 02:36:45,568
down by his raging capabilities.

4318
02:36:49,377 --> 02:36:51,231
The impacts aren't doing as much damage

4319
02:36:51,231 --> 02:36:53,132
as you hoped they would.

4320
02:36:53,132 --> 02:36:54,505
SAM: Dammit.

4321
02:36:54,505 --> 02:36:56,062
MATT: But I believe that ends

4322
02:36:56,062 --> 02:36:57,714
your turn, unless you want to move?

4323
02:36:57,714 --> 02:36:59,180
Nope, no moving.

4324
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:02,077
MATT: All right. Kevdak's turn.
Kevdak's going to go ahead

4325
02:37:02,077 --> 02:37:04,327
and strafe around this way.

4326
02:37:06,183 --> 02:37:11,023
And his going to go ahead
and reckless attack on you,

4327
02:37:11,023 --> 02:37:14,652
so that's an advantage on each strike.

4328
02:37:14,652 --> 02:37:18,652
Is going to take both of
these as weapon master.

4329
02:37:24,713 --> 02:37:28,431
That is a 28 to hit, sorry minus five, 23.

4330
02:37:28,431 --> 02:37:29,394
TRAVIS: Hits.

4331
02:37:29,394 --> 02:37:30,477
Second one.

4332
02:37:37,371 --> 02:37:40,874
28 to hit again, with the minus five.

4333
02:37:40,874 --> 02:37:42,784
TRAVIS: Misses, I mean hits, sorry.

4334
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:45,117
All right, let's see...

4335
02:37:57,628 --> 02:37:59,045
Less than that...

4336
02:38:00,358 --> 02:38:03,004
As both of the ax swings come through you,

4337
02:38:03,004 --> 02:38:07,171
you suffer a total of 54
points of slashing damage.

4338
02:38:09,311 --> 02:38:10,186
TRAVIS: Reduced?

4339
02:38:10,186 --> 02:38:13,769
Reduced by half, so that brings it to 27.

4340
02:38:16,213 --> 02:38:20,213
Plus an additional ten
points of necrotic damage

4341
02:38:22,290 --> 02:38:24,268
that you do not reduce.

4342
02:38:24,268 --> 02:38:27,462
LAURA: While all the attention
is focused on them,

4343
02:38:27,462 --> 02:38:29,464
can I stealth down to
the ground for a second?

4344
02:38:29,464 --> 02:38:30,805
MATT: Make a stealth check.

4345
02:38:30,805 --> 02:38:32,885
How are you getting down?

4346
02:38:32,885 --> 02:38:34,410
Are you climbing down via acrobatics?

4347
02:38:34,410 --> 02:38:37,660
So make a stealth and acrobatics check.

4348
02:38:39,345 --> 02:38:40,762
29 for stealth.

4349
02:38:43,057 --> 02:38:44,900
And 25 for acrobatics.

4350
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:47,528
Okay. You manage to make it to the ground.

4351
02:38:47,528 --> 02:38:49,711
Kind of jumping off the
side, parkouring down,

4352
02:38:49,711 --> 02:38:51,206
grabbing the next ledge, leaping down.

4353
02:38:51,206 --> 02:38:52,782
That's your turn.

4354
02:38:52,782 --> 02:38:55,839
Okay, anybody else doing anything?

4355
02:38:55,839 --> 02:38:57,498
Until we come back in the next round?

4356
02:38:57,498 --> 02:38:59,008
SAM: I mean...

4357
02:38:59,008 --> 02:39:02,100
MARISHA: Do we do anything right now?

4358
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:04,791
Not until he says so.

4359
02:39:05,679 --> 02:39:06,960
LAURA: I just want to duck, can I just

4360
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:08,890
duck in the building at least?

4361
02:39:08,890 --> 02:39:10,519
Is that part of the stealth?

4362
02:39:10,519 --> 02:39:12,130
MATT: Sure, you come to the door

4363
02:39:12,130 --> 02:39:14,024
and the door itself is not locked,

4364
02:39:14,024 --> 02:39:15,513
you kind of just push
on the side of the door.

4365
02:39:15,513 --> 02:39:19,169
Everyone's attention is
so focused on the center.

4366
02:39:19,169 --> 02:39:21,782
All right. So that brings it
to the top of the round,

4367
02:39:21,782 --> 02:39:23,539
Grog, you're up.

4368
02:39:23,539 --> 02:39:25,159
Feeling the impact of those hits,

4369
02:39:25,159 --> 02:39:28,468
and remembering our first encounter,

4370
02:39:28,468 --> 02:39:31,135
I drop the firebrand war hammer,

4371
02:39:32,783 --> 02:39:36,950
I rush Kevdak, and I want to
try and rip away the blood ax.

4372
02:39:39,125 --> 02:39:40,375
MARISHA: Oh.

4373
02:39:42,228 --> 02:39:43,061
MATT: Okay.

4374
02:39:44,988 --> 02:39:47,804
You rush up and drop the hammer.

4375
02:39:47,804 --> 02:39:50,320
Grab and you're face to face,

4376
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:52,527
it's right at your feet,
you reach up and grab,

4377
02:39:52,527 --> 02:39:54,480
with your fingers just
barely wrapped around this

4378
02:39:54,480 --> 02:39:58,403
ax's shaft right now, at
the size that it's swollen,

4379
02:39:58,403 --> 02:40:00,645
and you pull against him,

4380
02:40:00,645 --> 02:40:02,291
I want you to go ahead
and make a strength check.

4381
02:40:02,291 --> 02:40:04,057
TRAVIS: Which I get advantage on.

4382
02:40:04,057 --> 02:40:05,482
MATT: Yeah, versus his strength,

4383
02:40:05,482 --> 02:40:07,732
which he gets advantage on.

4384
02:40:11,825 --> 02:40:12,658
17.

4385
02:40:13,743 --> 02:40:14,719
Natural 20.

4386
02:40:14,719 --> 02:40:16,126
LAURA: Oh, come on!

4387
02:40:16,126 --> 02:40:20,293
As you pull, Kevdak actually
lifts you up off the ground,

4388
02:40:22,083 --> 02:40:26,400
holding the ax up to
his face and just goes,

4389
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:28,400
"Like father, like son."

4390
02:40:29,779 --> 02:40:33,164
And shakes you off, well
doesn't even shake you off,

4391
02:40:33,164 --> 02:40:37,331
just butts you off of the ax
and you skid to the ground.

4392
02:40:40,137 --> 02:40:42,776
Take one point of bludgeoning
damage, no big deal.

4393
02:40:42,776 --> 02:40:45,274
Land on the ground, you don't fall prone,

4394
02:40:45,274 --> 02:40:46,925
but you're there and can probably grab

4395
02:40:46,925 --> 02:40:49,381
your war hammer and pick
it back up if you want to.

4396
02:40:49,381 --> 02:40:50,829
TRAVIS: Yep, I'll do that.

4397
02:40:50,829 --> 02:40:53,362
TALIESIN: Oh my God, oh my God.

4398
02:40:53,362 --> 02:40:54,814
That ends your turn.

4399
02:40:54,814 --> 02:40:58,492
Now Kevdak, who's kind
of laughing to himself.

4400
02:40:58,492 --> 02:41:01,743
(laughs evilly)

4401
02:41:01,743 --> 02:41:03,678
MARISHA: Oh, he's consulting the book.

4402
02:41:03,678 --> 02:41:05,556
TALIESIN: I hate when he does that.

4403
02:41:05,556 --> 02:41:07,594
Why, what could that possibly mean?

4404
02:41:07,594 --> 02:41:09,373
LIAM: He's probably looking
up the price of a mace.

4405
02:41:09,373 --> 02:41:10,352
MARISHA: Totally.

4406
02:41:10,352 --> 02:41:13,019
What's an adventurer's kit run for?

4407
02:41:13,998 --> 02:41:15,695
SAM: Who did this illustration again?

4408
02:41:15,695 --> 02:41:16,860
Oh yeah, I remember.

4409
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:20,113
MATT: Why don't you make an athletics check.

4410
02:41:20,113 --> 02:41:21,883
TALIESIN: Does he get advantage on that?

4411
02:41:21,883 --> 02:41:25,383
MATT: Yes, you do, because of the rage.

4412
02:41:29,915 --> 02:41:31,173
19.

4413
02:41:31,173 --> 02:41:32,423
19, well, 22.

4414
02:41:33,705 --> 02:41:36,063
He puts the ax to one hand,

4415
02:41:36,063 --> 02:41:38,103
reaches down with his large mitt,

4416
02:41:38,103 --> 02:41:39,705
grabs you and lifts you up

4417
02:41:39,705 --> 02:41:43,625
and pushes you onto one
of the spears behind you.

4418
02:41:44,922 --> 02:41:48,568
You can feel it actually pierce
out the front of your chest.

4419
02:41:48,568 --> 02:41:49,594
(group groans)

4420
02:41:49,594 --> 02:41:51,649
About six inches.

4421
02:41:51,649 --> 02:41:54,068
Your feet are still on the ground,

4422
02:41:54,068 --> 02:41:55,402
and you can feel yourself there,

4423
02:41:55,402 --> 02:41:59,235
but there is an element
of being pinned there.

4424
02:42:00,347 --> 02:42:05,994
You take 12 points of piercing
damage, reduced to six.

4425
02:42:10,010 --> 02:42:14,177
This is nothing to a barbarian,
simple piercing, whatever.

4426
02:42:16,973 --> 02:42:20,223
However you are technically considered,

4427
02:42:21,827 --> 02:42:24,147
this would be grappled,
you're unable to move

4428
02:42:24,147 --> 02:42:26,490
until you manage to break this.

4429
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:28,341
You can still attack from this
position if you wanted to,

4430
02:42:28,341 --> 02:42:29,702
but you have to be able to try

4431
02:42:29,702 --> 02:42:32,854
and spend an action to get free.

4432
02:42:32,854 --> 02:42:35,502
So that's going to be the one attack,

4433
02:42:35,502 --> 02:42:36,953
and then as your pinned, he's going to

4434
02:42:36,953 --> 02:42:40,370
come up with the blood ax and swing down.

4435
02:42:43,898 --> 02:42:46,961
That's going to be a 23 against you.

4436
02:42:48,362 --> 02:42:51,652
Blood ax comes down and slams right

4437
02:42:51,652 --> 02:42:54,592
into the front of your
chest, the sternum area,

4438
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:57,402
even with the weight of it,

4439
02:42:59,490 --> 02:43:03,393
you bring your hands up
and grab the edge of it

4440
02:43:03,393 --> 02:43:04,994
and manage to stop some of the force,

4441
02:43:04,994 --> 02:43:08,560
but it still digs into
the front of your chest.

4442
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:17,327
You take 19 points of
slashing damage, reduced to 9.

4443
02:43:18,572 --> 02:43:20,990
I release Trinket inside
the house that I'm in.

4444
02:43:20,990 --> 02:43:22,770
MATT: Plus an additional six necrotic

4445
02:43:22,770 --> 02:43:24,923
that does not get reduced.

4446
02:43:24,923 --> 02:43:27,345
So 9 and then six, so 15.

4447
02:43:27,345 --> 02:43:29,239
MATT: What are you doing?

4448
02:43:29,239 --> 02:43:33,253
I release Trinket,
quietly, inside the house.

4449
02:43:33,253 --> 02:43:34,923
And tell him to keep quiet.

4450
02:43:35,783 --> 02:43:37,116
Don't follow me.

4451
02:43:39,298 --> 02:43:40,962
Okay. Anyone else do anything else?

4452
02:43:40,962 --> 02:43:43,012
TALIESIN: No, I'm just trying to--

4453
02:43:43,012 --> 02:43:46,091
I'm trying to keep us aware
of everything as possible.

4454
02:43:46,091 --> 02:43:48,369
Pike an I are going to just inch forward

4455
02:43:48,369 --> 02:43:51,493
on the rooftop, to get
just a little closer.

4456
02:43:51,493 --> 02:43:54,140
Yeah, can I do the same
in my elemental form?

4457
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:55,858
Like, can I just mist kind of down around

4458
02:43:55,858 --> 02:43:58,460
kind of right behind this asshole?

4459
02:43:58,460 --> 02:44:00,877
What's up, I'm a spooky mist.

4460
02:44:02,066 --> 02:44:03,613
ASHLEY: Would it take some time

4461
02:44:03,613 --> 02:44:05,608
to get like behind that fountain?

4462
02:44:05,608 --> 02:44:08,626
LIAM: That's in the open,
I asked about that first.

4463
02:44:08,626 --> 02:44:11,336
TALIESIN: This is one quarter of the square.

4464
02:44:12,237 --> 02:44:14,904
All right. Grog, it's your turn.

4465
02:44:16,518 --> 02:44:18,285
You said I can attack from having

4466
02:44:18,285 --> 02:44:21,821
a pole shoved through my shoulder?

4467
02:44:21,821 --> 02:44:23,476
MATT: Yeah.

4468
02:44:23,476 --> 02:44:25,456
Would that be at disadvantage?

4469
02:44:25,456 --> 02:44:26,962
MATT: No, not at this distance.

4470
02:44:26,962 --> 02:44:29,570
You just, you're grappled,
so you can't move.

4471
02:44:29,570 --> 02:44:31,950
You're essentially stuck
there until you use an action

4472
02:44:31,950 --> 02:44:33,932
to get off of it, otherwise
you can't go anywhere.

4473
02:44:33,932 --> 02:44:35,328
Yeah, I got to get off of it.

4474
02:44:35,328 --> 02:44:36,719
I'm going to get off of it.

4475
02:44:36,719 --> 02:44:38,441
MATT: Okay, so using an
action to break free.

4476
02:44:38,441 --> 02:44:39,461
Yeah.

4477
02:44:39,461 --> 02:44:42,074
MATT: Make an athletics check,

4478
02:44:42,074 --> 02:44:45,157
with advantage because you're raging.

4479
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:47,306
23.

4480
02:44:47,306 --> 02:44:48,306
MATT: 23?

4481
02:44:49,931 --> 02:44:51,441
There's not a lot of
ground to pull yourself

4482
02:44:51,441 --> 02:44:55,576
off of the weight, so instead,
with your feet on the ground,

4483
02:44:55,576 --> 02:44:57,183
you reach forward and grab the front

4484
02:44:57,183 --> 02:44:59,945
of his blood ax again and pull forward.

4485
02:44:59,945 --> 02:45:03,257
And as you do, you feel the
back of this wooden spear,

4486
02:45:03,257 --> 02:45:06,888
snap off and it's still
just embedded in your chest,

4487
02:45:06,888 --> 02:45:09,811
poking out the front,
but you are now free,

4488
02:45:09,811 --> 02:45:11,689
you still have your bonus action.

4489
02:45:11,689 --> 02:45:15,106
I would like to use great weapon master

4490
02:45:16,057 --> 02:45:19,545
and I have advantage on this
because he used reckless.

4491
02:45:19,545 --> 02:45:20,689
MATT: Yep.

4492
02:45:20,689 --> 02:45:22,871
And I'll use his inspiration.

4493
02:45:22,871 --> 02:45:24,018
LAURA: If you need it.

4494
02:45:24,018 --> 02:45:28,101
MATT: It faded, it only
lasts for ten minutes.

4495
02:45:29,799 --> 02:45:30,798
23.

4496
02:45:30,798 --> 02:45:34,548
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4497
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:40,463
19.

4498
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:45,300
No, 29. Sorry.

4499
02:45:45,594 --> 02:45:47,930
29 with the plus ten, right?

4500
02:45:47,930 --> 02:45:50,303
Okay, that brings it to 14 damage,

4501
02:45:50,303 --> 02:45:52,791
reduced by his rage effect as well.

4502
02:45:52,791 --> 02:45:56,628
As the hammer slams once
again into his abdomen,

4503
02:45:56,628 --> 02:45:58,495
you can see it leaving a char mark

4504
02:45:58,495 --> 02:46:01,873
and actually kind of
obscuring one of the tattoos.

4505
02:46:02,913 --> 02:46:03,996
"Stupid boy."

4506
02:46:07,191 --> 02:46:09,300
You can move around him if you wanted to,

4507
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:10,627
you still have a movement.

4508
02:46:10,627 --> 02:46:13,048
Yeah, I'll move, I would
like to move to his flank,

4509
02:46:13,048 --> 02:46:15,591
away from the nearest pointy thing.

4510
02:46:15,591 --> 02:46:17,535
MATT: Okay, so you shift around that way?

4511
02:46:17,535 --> 02:46:20,803
Okay, with his turn now, he
spins around to face you.

4512
02:46:20,803 --> 02:46:24,970
He's going to go ahead and
attempt his first attack on you,

4513
02:46:27,313 --> 02:46:29,146
as a disarming attack.

4514
02:46:31,107 --> 02:46:32,490
With advantage on that because,

4515
02:46:32,490 --> 02:46:34,871
just going with this attack every round.

4516
02:46:34,871 --> 02:46:36,871
That's going to be a 30.

4517
02:46:38,289 --> 02:46:39,509
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'll hit.

4518
02:46:39,509 --> 02:46:40,669
(laughter)

4519
02:46:40,669 --> 02:46:42,717
Okay. Not Great Weapon Master.

4520
02:46:42,717 --> 02:46:44,772
But it's 30, so it's
going to do an additional

4521
02:46:44,772 --> 02:46:48,189
superiority die of damage on top of this.

4522
02:46:49,231 --> 02:46:50,731
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

4523
02:46:52,672 --> 02:46:56,839
So you take, all right.

4524
02:46:57,293 --> 02:47:00,293
17 points of slashing damage.

4525
02:47:02,819 --> 02:47:04,915
TRAVIS: Nine?

4526
02:47:05,489 --> 02:47:08,208
Eight plus two necrotic, so 10 total.

4527
02:47:08,958 --> 02:47:12,629
And I need you to go ahead and
make a strength saving throw.

4528
02:47:12,629 --> 02:47:15,754
TALIESIN: Oh no, no advantage.

4529
02:47:15,754 --> 02:47:17,222
MATT: With rage is it strength

4530
02:47:17,222 --> 02:47:19,972
ability checks and saving throws?

4531
02:47:20,905 --> 02:47:23,590
Advantage on strength check
and strength saving throws.

4532
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:26,840
MATT: So yeah, so advantage on this.

4533
02:47:32,196 --> 02:47:33,334
13.

4534
02:47:34,034 --> 02:47:35,033
MATT: 13.

4535
02:47:35,033 --> 02:47:36,231
No, no, no 16.

4536
02:47:36,231 --> 02:47:37,746
MATT: 16, okay.

4537
02:47:37,746 --> 02:47:40,569
So as he slams into your side,

4538
02:47:40,569 --> 02:47:43,757
you pull up your flaming war
hammer to guard the blow,

4539
02:47:43,757 --> 02:47:47,094
it takes some of it, but then
he hooks the bottom of the ax

4540
02:47:47,094 --> 02:47:51,066
underneath the head and actually
flings it out of your hand

4541
02:47:51,066 --> 02:47:52,414
and you lose the grip on the war hammer,

4542
02:47:52,414 --> 02:47:55,136
which then clatters to
the ground at your feet.

4543
02:47:55,136 --> 02:47:57,740
He's then going to turn around.

4544
02:47:57,740 --> 02:48:01,553
And going to go ahead
and do a pushing attack.

4545
02:48:01,553 --> 02:48:03,636
With the superiority die.

4546
02:48:05,107 --> 02:48:08,389
That is going to be, this is going to be,

4547
02:48:08,389 --> 02:48:12,775
with Great Weapon Master,
that brings it to a 21.

4548
02:48:12,775 --> 02:48:13,978
TRAVIS: That's my AC.

4549
02:48:13,978 --> 02:48:17,728
MATT: All righty. So you take
from the actual blow,

4550
02:48:19,469 --> 02:48:23,219
21 points of slashing
damage, reduced to ten.

4551
02:48:24,667 --> 02:48:26,167
And five necrotic.

4552
02:48:27,654 --> 02:48:30,429
I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance.

4553
02:48:30,429 --> 02:48:32,012
MATT: Go for it.

4554
02:48:33,407 --> 02:48:37,332
LAURA: What's Stone's Endurance?

4555
02:48:37,332 --> 02:48:40,574
It's just a d12, which is a 12,

4556
02:48:40,574 --> 02:48:43,491
plus my constitution, so that's 17.

4557
02:48:44,648 --> 02:48:47,193
So as the blow comes, you just take it

4558
02:48:47,193 --> 02:48:48,460
right to the center of the chest.

4559
02:48:48,460 --> 02:48:50,808
As it hits, it barely cuts in before you

4560
02:48:50,808 --> 02:48:54,397
go ahead and grab and
deflect it with your hand,

4561
02:48:54,397 --> 02:48:56,155
doing no damage to you whatsoever.

4562
02:48:56,155 --> 02:48:57,583
However the impact of it though--

4563
02:48:57,583 --> 02:49:01,750
make a strength saving
throw with advantage again.

4564
02:49:05,334 --> 02:49:06,158
18.

4565
02:49:06,758 --> 02:49:09,288
18, however the sheer force
of trying to deflect it,

4566
02:49:09,288 --> 02:49:13,455
does push you back 15 feet,
right on the edge there,

4567
02:49:14,334 --> 02:49:16,772
we'll say you're right there, that's fine.

4568
02:49:16,772 --> 02:49:20,244
And you stop right at the edge of another,

4569
02:49:20,244 --> 02:49:22,486
edge of the spikes and
there are two goliaths

4570
02:49:22,486 --> 02:49:24,245
that are there with their weapons out,

4571
02:49:24,245 --> 02:49:26,144
just forcing you back into the ring,

4572
02:49:26,144 --> 02:49:28,217
if you decide to back up any further.

4573
02:49:29,973 --> 02:49:31,985
And with that, Kevdak's going
to go ahead and move forward

4574
02:49:31,985 --> 02:49:34,903
and push you into that corner.

4575
02:49:34,903 --> 02:49:37,320
That's going to end his turn.

4576
02:49:39,927 --> 02:49:40,760
You're up.

4577
02:49:44,956 --> 02:49:48,623
I'm going to look at Kevdak
and drop my arms to my side.

4578
02:49:49,294 --> 02:49:51,674
MATT: It's already on your side actually.

4579
02:49:51,674 --> 02:49:53,399
He disarmed you.

4580
02:49:53,399 --> 02:49:55,152
No, not my arms.

4581
02:49:55,152 --> 02:49:56,188
MATT: Oh, your arms, okay.

4582
02:49:56,188 --> 02:49:57,521
Straight down.

4583
02:49:59,297 --> 02:50:03,297
And I'm going to say,
"Clearly I've been a fool."

4584
02:50:05,202 --> 02:50:08,702
"You are truly a foe to be reckoned with."

4585
02:50:11,511 --> 02:50:14,428
And I will slowly drop to my knees.

4586
02:50:15,396 --> 02:50:17,674
SAM: (gasps)

4587
02:50:17,674 --> 02:50:18,841
(quietly) No, no Grog.

4588
02:50:19,943 --> 02:50:22,432
And I will shout out:

4589
02:50:22,432 --> 02:50:25,432
"Vox Machina!"

4590
02:50:25,432 --> 02:50:28,535
"Fuck shit up!"

4591
02:50:28,910 --> 02:50:31,160
(cheering)

4592
02:50:31,386 --> 02:50:34,391
And we're going to go ahead
and end it there this week.

4593
02:50:34,391 --> 02:50:36,058
(loud exclamations)

4594
02:50:36,058 --> 02:50:37,917
It's 11 o'clock guys.

4595
02:50:37,917 --> 02:50:39,435
Oh, all right.

4596
02:50:39,435 --> 02:50:41,063
(groaning)

4597
02:50:41,063 --> 02:50:42,062
It's 11 o'clock.

4598
02:50:42,062 --> 02:50:43,660
MARISHA: And we started late.

4599
02:50:43,660 --> 02:50:45,204
I know, I know.

4600
02:50:45,204 --> 02:50:46,882
MARISHA: Curse you technical difficulties.

4601
02:50:46,882 --> 02:50:48,916
(laughter)

4602
02:50:48,916 --> 02:50:50,098
Wow.

4603
02:50:50,098 --> 02:50:53,628
We need to remember
where we are, you guys.

4604
02:50:53,628 --> 02:50:54,626
TALIESIN: We'll take a photograph,

4605
02:50:54,626 --> 02:50:55,637
that's what iPhones are for.

4606
02:50:55,637 --> 02:50:57,486
MATT: No, we're taking photos.

4607
02:50:57,486 --> 02:50:58,596
MARISHA: I don't think I can forget.

4608
02:50:58,596 --> 02:50:59,835
MATT: I'm leaving this here for next week.

4609
02:50:59,835 --> 02:51:02,576
So we can have this up and
ready for us to jump back in.

4610
02:51:02,576 --> 02:51:05,383
LAURA: Oh my God-duh!

4611
02:51:05,383 --> 02:51:07,210
MARISHA: Fuck shit up!

4612
02:51:07,210 --> 02:51:09,220
LIAM: That's so unsatisfying!

4613
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:10,484
(groaning)

4614
02:51:10,484 --> 02:51:12,368
ASHLEY: I want to go right now.

4615
02:51:12,368 --> 02:51:13,368
MATT: If you guys want to keep going,

4616
02:51:13,368 --> 02:51:15,299
we can go to midnight on, it's up to you.

4617
02:51:15,299 --> 02:51:16,969
But it's a Thursday night.

4618
02:51:16,969 --> 02:51:18,133
ASHLEY: I know.

4619
02:51:18,133 --> 02:51:19,666
LAURA: Let's wait, let's wait.

4620
02:51:19,666 --> 02:51:22,999
What's the general consensus say?

4621
02:51:22,999 --> 02:51:24,052
I have to shoot tomorrow.

4622
02:51:24,052 --> 02:51:25,211
The general consensus is it's 11 PM

4623
02:51:25,211 --> 02:51:28,308
and we're keeping the crew here as well.

4624
02:51:28,308 --> 02:51:29,306
SAM: Let's call it.

4625
02:51:29,306 --> 02:51:31,405
And we had a very long Critmas

4626
02:51:31,405 --> 02:51:32,958
and everything the week before,

4627
02:51:32,958 --> 02:51:35,005
so let's go ahead and
we'll call it tonight.

4628
02:51:35,005 --> 02:51:39,121
We'll pick up right at this
ridiculous moment next week.

4629
02:51:39,261 --> 02:51:41,312
TALIESIN: Tune in next week.

4630
02:51:41,312 --> 02:51:44,626
MARISHA: It's like the battle of blue balls.

4631
02:51:45,556 --> 02:51:47,097
TALIESIN: Goliath balls are blue.

4632
02:51:47,097 --> 02:51:49,877
Goliath balls are so blue.

4633
02:51:49,877 --> 02:51:51,654
LAURA: Dude.

4634
02:51:51,654 --> 02:51:52,680
TRAVIS: I was not expecting that.

4635
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:53,773
He was so much more powerful than what...

4636
02:51:53,773 --> 02:51:54,944
Yeah, I was not expecting that.

4637
02:51:54,944 --> 02:51:56,004
MARISHA: He's so big.

4638
02:51:56,004 --> 02:51:57,012
SAM: I think you can take him.

4639
02:51:57,012 --> 02:51:58,219
We'll figure it out.

4640
02:51:58,219 --> 02:52:00,599
TRAVIS: I think it's going well.

4641
02:52:00,599 --> 02:52:02,419
I think we've got him
right where I want him.

4642
02:52:02,419 --> 02:52:07,335
MARISHA: Just five more
minutes, five more minutes.

4643
02:52:07,335 --> 02:52:09,085
MATT: Yeah, that's rough.

4644
02:52:11,375 --> 02:52:13,697
Where are you at hit points wise?

4645
02:52:13,697 --> 02:52:15,043
133.

4646
02:52:15,043 --> 02:52:16,477
SAM: You're fine,

4647
02:52:16,477 --> 02:52:18,692
you could go for another six rounds!

4648
02:52:18,692 --> 02:52:22,069
MARISHA: You're at 133 out of your total?

4649
02:52:22,069 --> 02:52:23,400
201.

4650
02:52:23,400 --> 02:52:25,110
(groaning)

4651
02:52:25,110 --> 02:52:26,652
He's fine, he's fine.

4652
02:52:26,652 --> 02:52:29,312
I'm doing nothing to him.

4653
02:52:29,965 --> 02:52:31,850
TALIESIN: That's true,
you haven't done a thing.

4654
02:52:31,850 --> 02:52:34,118
Has he done any damage to him at all?

4655
02:52:34,118 --> 02:52:35,457
SAM: Yeah, a little.

4656
02:52:35,457 --> 02:52:39,532
Yeah, Grog's done 34 points of damage.

4657
02:52:39,532 --> 02:52:42,929
Wow, out of like 500 hit points probably.

4658
02:52:42,929 --> 02:52:45,242
There's different paths to a barbarian,

4659
02:52:45,242 --> 02:52:47,320
there's the frenzy path,
which is all about damage,

4660
02:52:47,320 --> 02:52:50,250
there's the totem path,
which totem of the bear means

4661
02:52:50,250 --> 02:52:53,895
your half damage for everything
except psychic damage.

4662
02:52:54,965 --> 02:52:57,040
Grog, quick, be psychic.

4663
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:58,372
(laughter)

4664
02:52:58,372 --> 02:53:00,078
Good luck with that guys.

4665
02:53:00,078 --> 02:53:04,161
But yeah, this is where
that totem really shines.

4666
02:53:05,897 --> 02:53:08,330
LIAM: If I steal your Kevdak mini,

4667
02:53:08,330 --> 02:53:09,996
he can't be killed.

4668
02:53:09,996 --> 02:53:10,994
SAM: That's true.

4669
02:53:10,994 --> 02:53:11,992
MATT: I've got four.

4670
02:53:11,992 --> 02:53:12,998
(laughter)

4671
02:53:12,998 --> 02:53:13,997
Not really.

4672
02:53:13,997 --> 02:53:17,284
Where does the other totem shine?

4673
02:53:17,284 --> 02:53:19,362
In damage dealing, probably?

4674
02:53:19,362 --> 02:53:21,803
Frenzy's all about damage and
that's what Grog's playing.

4675
02:53:21,803 --> 02:53:24,285
Anyway guys, we'll pick this up next week

4676
02:53:24,285 --> 02:53:26,124
at whatever this is about to be,

4677
02:53:26,124 --> 02:53:30,217
and I have no idea what
this is about to be.

4678
02:53:30,217 --> 02:53:31,383
With cameras and stuff though,

4679
02:53:31,383 --> 02:53:32,706
we'll have cameras and stuff here.

4680
02:53:32,706 --> 02:53:34,197
Yeah, hopefully functional cameras.

4681
02:53:34,197 --> 02:53:36,374
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll have a video card next week.

4682
02:53:36,374 --> 02:53:41,113
We may already have one
thanks to Frye's Electronics.

4683
02:53:41,113 --> 02:53:42,462
The fickleness of technology

4684
02:53:42,462 --> 02:53:44,819
and the wondrous hard work of our crew.

4685
02:53:44,819 --> 02:53:46,751
Make this still happen guys.

4686
02:53:46,751 --> 02:53:48,493
Once again, as I don't know who it was

4687
02:53:48,493 --> 02:53:51,106
that pointed it out,
but we went 50 episodes.

4688
02:53:51,106 --> 02:53:52,103
That was me.

4689
02:53:52,103 --> 02:53:54,518
50 episodes without any real huge..

4690
02:53:54,518 --> 02:53:55,795
MATT: Hardware failures, yeah.

4691
02:53:55,795 --> 02:53:57,060
Hardware failures.

4692
02:53:57,060 --> 02:53:58,743
So that's funny.

4693
02:53:58,743 --> 02:54:00,660
Episode 51 just ate it.

4694
02:54:02,657 --> 02:54:07,265
Thank you guys for enduring
our spree of technical issues,

4695
02:54:07,265 --> 02:54:09,749
and our evening of one cuts,

4696
02:54:09,749 --> 02:54:11,058
I hope it wasn't too distracting.

4697
02:54:11,058 --> 02:54:13,726
Please do come back next week,

4698
02:54:13,726 --> 02:54:16,874
because this shit's going to be crazy.

4699
02:54:16,874 --> 02:54:18,107
(laughter)

4700
02:54:18,107 --> 02:54:20,083
You're not going to want to miss this.

4701
02:54:20,083 --> 02:54:21,752
So yeah, we'll see you guys next week, and...

4702
02:54:22,522 --> 02:54:23,969
Is it Thursday yet?

4703
02:54:23,969 --> 02:54:25,346
Have a good night.
