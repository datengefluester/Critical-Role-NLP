1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,648
MATT: Welcome, everyone, to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:08,976
actors sit around, roll dice, and play Dungeons
and Dragons. We are back after a week hiatus in

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,094
which we were at San Diego Comic-Con!

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,214
(cheering)

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:21,280
MATT: We are recovering, some more than others,
from Comic-Con. But we had a great time. Fantastic

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,214
turnout. It was great to meet all those wonderful
Critters that got out there, you guys were

7
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:33,110
awesome. The panels were sufficiently ridiculous. And
yeah, it was a good time had by all. If you

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,628
weren't there, I know Geek and Sundry put up the
panels, the videos from the panels up on the

9
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:42,070
website, geekandsundry.com, so you can check them
out there. Speaking of cool events, we're actually

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,121
going to be at GenCon next week.

11
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:46,349
SAM: What?

12
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:52,585
MATT: I know, it's crazy! I am at a series of
panels all throughout the weekend, many of them

13
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,831
voiceover-related.

14
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:55,946
LAURA: Because you're special.

15
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:59,788
MATT: Because my manager got to them first.

16
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:01,772
(laughter)

17
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:06,172
MATT: We're going to have signings I believe on
Friday, or is it Friday or Saturday?

18
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:07,111
LAURA: Saturday.

19
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,817
MATT: Saturday, we'll have signings--

20
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:11,256
MARISHA: In which we have a new poster.

21
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:19,165
LAURA: It is exclusive to GenCon, the same way we
did our exclusive for New York Comic-Con poster

22
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:20,324
last year.

23
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:28,377
MARISHA: Also designed by Joma, aka
@ForgingMeanings on Twitter. So yeah, it's our

24
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:31,609
next iteration of our box art poster.

25
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:33,512
TRAVIS: Whoa! It is sexy!

26
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:35,583
MARISHA: The advanced edition, y'all.

27
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:41,991
MATT: Yeah. I will say that the last poster was
based heavily on the Underdark arc and the coming

28
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:48,508
battle with K'Varn. This one has to do with a
later arc in the story. So there's that coming up,

29
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,368
we're excited about that, and then we have our
Critical Role live show that Saturday at 8pm

30
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:53,668
Eastern Time.

31
00:01:53,668 --> 00:02:01,441
SAM: Tickets are still available online, post the
link right now in the chat, someone, please.

32
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,021
(laughter)

33
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:04,534
TRAVIS: That's going to be some insane audience.

34
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:09,424
MATT: We'd love to see you guys. Partially because
we don't get out to the middle eastern side of the

35
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:14,290
US as often as we'd like, and this is our first
time at GenCon, which has been my gaming mecca for

36
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,464
so long. Should be a fun way to roll it in. So
come check in the next chapter that'll continue

37
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:26,719
after tonight's episode, at GenCon, and hope to see
you there. We have our sponsor tonight for this

38
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:34,606
episode of Critical Role, returning favorite in
Backblaze, who previously popped in to say hello.

39
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,037
Sam, if you want to say a few words.

40
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:44,056
SAM: Backblaze is back, everybody. I've already
composed a song about it. It goes like this:

41
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:54,252
(singing) Everybody, yeah. Backup your data, yeah.
Upload your local files to an encrypted

42
00:02:54,252 --> 00:03:02,861
cloud-based backup storage system, yeah. Backblaze
back, all right! (speaking) That was good!

43
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,550
MATT: That was a thing that happened.

44
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:16,500
SAM: Backblaze is unlimited cloud backup for Macs,
PCs, for just $5 a month. You can back up your

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,642
fanart there, your fanfiction, the dirty stuff,
photos, videos, drawings, documents, it's

46
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:30,102
everything. I actually use this service. My stuff
is continually uploading to the cloud and I always

47
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,930
know it's there for when my hard drive crashes,
they'll send you a new one in the mail--

48
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,223
TRAVIS: They'll mail you one?

49
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:37,718
SAM: They can mail you one. It's all kinds of
crazy options.

50
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,314
LIAM: Think of the gigs of erotica that could just
exist out there.

51
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:48,984
SAM: And Critters get a fully-featured 15-day free
trial at backblaze.com/criticalrole. So go check

52
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:52,482
it out, keep that song in the back of your mind
when you do.

53
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,571
(laughter)

54
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:56,354
SAM: And they also made a little commercial for
us.

55
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,876
LAURA: Oh yeah, I just love them so much.

56
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:00,410
MARISHA: I know, it's so great.

57
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,382
MATT: Well cool, thank you very much, Sam.

58
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:03,948
SAM: Do you want to hear the song again?

59
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:05,674
(groaning)

60
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:08,036
TRAVIS: Can we please? I'll give you some of my
beef and broccoli.

61
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:10,720
LAURA: It smells really good.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,599
MATT: Next item: for anyone who wants any of the
information about our GenCon panels events and

63
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:23,003
signings and such, you can go to
geekandsundry.com/CRLiveGenCon16.

64
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:25,070
LAURA: That's long. It should be in the chat
room.

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:31,675
MATT: Should be in the chat room, check it out,
definitely go there. And tonight is the last night

66
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:39,119
for you guys to pre-order the Critter-designed
T-shirt, the Chroma Conclave shirt that you guys

67
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,552
voted for that won our design contest.

68
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:43,414
SAM: Twice. It won it twice.

69
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,019
LAURA: It's beautiful.

70
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,759
MATT: So if you're interested in grabbing that,
tonight's your last night, and you should just do

71
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,773
it now. Soon. Do we have anything else we wish to
announce, anything else creeping up?

72
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:59,764
LAURA: Travis and I are seeing Hamilton this
weekend. What?

73
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:04,344
TRAVIS: It is an announcement. We're seeing
Hamilton on Saturday.

74
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:07,178
LIAM: Is there any other shitty bragging anyone
else would like to do?

75
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:10,710
TRAVIS: Javier MuÅ„oz and I are going to be best
friends, and then I'm going to go to dinner with

76
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,004
George Washington. I'm going to shave his head.
It's going to be awesome.

77
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,055
MATT: You have this all planned out.

78
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:20,475
LAURA: Yeah, we really do. He's written some
fanfiction about it. You just wait.

79
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:22,349
MATT: Which you can save on your Backblaze
account.

80
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:24,131
(laughter)

81
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:25,436
TRAVIS: It's there!

82
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:31,669
MATT: Indeed. All right then, that being the case,
let us dive into the insanity of the Feywild in

83
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,940
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

84
00:05:33,940 --> 00:07:04,179
[dramatic music]

85
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:11,311
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. So. Getting us into
the story for this evening, the backstory of the

86
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:16,544
current episode. Vox Machina, in attempting to
find ways to topple and destroy the Chroma

87
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:23,362
Conclave, have found their way around the world
seeking items called the Vestiges of Divergence,

88
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:28,562
artifacts of great power that should aid them in
their attempt to take down Thordak the Cinder

89
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:34,733
King, the red dragon who now sits lording over the
central town of Emon at the center of Tal'Dorei.

90
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:43,898
Their recent journey has brought them into the
Feywild, a pseudo-parallel plane of fey magic,

91
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:50,567
chaos, and all sorts of goodness in between.
They've wandered through, met an old friend in

92
00:07:50,567 --> 00:08:00,104
Nala, the nymph of the lake. Discovered a
fantastically artistically talented satyr by the

93
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:05,784
name of Garmelie, and had a trip to the city of
Syngorn, the elven city from Tal'Dorei which had

94
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:11,582
phased into this realm for safety when the dragons
of the Conclave attacked. After a fateful

95
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:18,825
re-meeting with the parents of Vex and Vax,
discussions were had, hats were attempted to be

96
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:25,249
stolen by the leader of the city and successfully
done so. The other half of agreements were

97
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,802
pseudo-achieved.

98
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,591
TALIESIN: Read your contract.

99
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:38,861
MATT: And they made their way northward through
the ever-shifting grasses to the outskirts of the

100
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:48,616
Moonbrush, a heavy, heavy, forested wood that will
lead them to their destination after that, which

101
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:54,314
is the Gilded Run, a series of rivers that wrap
around their final destination, the Shademirk Bog,

102
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:57,232
where apparently this Vestige exists.

103
00:08:57,232 --> 00:09:03,107
So. Diving in where we were. The last time, you
guys had managed to wander a few hours into the

104
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:09,801
southern portion of the forest of the Moonbrush.
Coming through, you realize that, as opposed to

105
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:15,047
the rest of the Feywild you've encountered so far,
which exists in a perpetual dusk, there is an

106
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:20,535
actual starry sky and moonlight poking through of
a full moon at portions of the canopy of this

107
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:27,885
forest. Cruising ever forward, you stumbled upon
what looked like some sort of a cave or cavern

108
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:35,966
with a series of small stone and wooden trinkets
and gifts that were left outside, as well as

109
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:41,478
carved bones and rotting fruits, and you came to
realize that these were probably left for the

110
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:44,556
spiritual entity that lived and existed within
this cavern.

111
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:53,096
Upon some of these gifts being disturbed, the bear
attacked, and Vex'ahlia summoned forth Trinket,

112
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:59,173
her faithful companion bear. A battle took place,
putting Trinket in a difficult position, but upon

113
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:05,754
a brief discussion with this spirit bear, had
proven himself a worthy entity, and was bestowed a

114
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:10,904
boon, further solidifying the bond between
Vex'ahlia and her faithful companion, Trinket.

115
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:14,401
And that was where we left off.

116
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,528
SAM: Didn't you just get some card or something
right at the end of--

117
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:19,028
LAURA: Yeah, I did.

118
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,443
SAM: Did we know what it was?

119
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:21,935
LAURA: Yeah, I did.

120
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,939
TALIESIN: It was a free $50 coupon for Lyft.

121
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:30,151
LAURA: What I'm really excited about is that card
was at the live show, and it is not in my stuff

122
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,598
right now, but I did.

123
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,958
MATT: She reaches for the necklace around her
neck, which is suddenly not there.

124
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,296
LAURA: No! I do, however, still have my title.

125
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:44,431
TRAVIS: You guys are still by yourselves, right?
You two?

126
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:46,558
MARISHA: Are Vex and I still separated?

127
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:53,004
MATT: No, the trees have relaxed, the canopy has
reopened above the small clearing, and the rest of

128
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:59,970
the party, you can now see Vex on her back on the
ground, Trinket standing over her towards the

129
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,515
cavern, and Keyleth pulled back, looking a bit
shocked and confused.

130
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,946
MARISHA: And is Oralan still there? Is that his
name?

131
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:15,802
MATT: The bear spirit? The bear spirit, upon
passing through Vex and Trinket, then dissipated

132
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:19,751
into a spark of naturalized druidic magic and
vanished.

133
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:21,394
MARISHA: So we're alone?

134
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:25,444
MATT: You are now alone in the center of that
clearing.

135
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,950
SAM: Oh my gods, what just happened?

136
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,028
(laughter)

137
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:35,708
LAURA: Everything's under control. We're alive.

138
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:40,266
SAM: I heard growling. Did the bear try to kill
you? I mean Trinket.

139
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,946
LAURA: No, yeah, Trinket tried to kill me, but
don't worry, everything's fine.

140
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,734
MARISHA: Really glad you learned how to speak with
animals.

141
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:51,030
LAURA: Me too! Keyleth, can you open up the trees
so our friends can get in?

142
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,284
MARISHA: Who? Our what? Who?

143
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,567
LAURA: Aren't we blocked off?

144
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,603
MATT: The trees have laxed and reopened.

145
00:11:56,603 --> 00:12:07,420
LAURA: I was busy looking for my card. And I found
it. Hi guys, my name is Vex'ahlia. Cool, yes,

146
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,972
we're good. Can I search for that tea set that I
tried to give him?

147
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,647
SAM: Tea set? What just happened?

148
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,191
MATT: Make an investigation check.

149
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:21,263
LAURA: Cool. Balls. Off to a good start.

150
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,415
TALIESIN: I'd like to take a look in the cave as
well a little bit.

151
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:26,899
MATT: Okay.

152
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,369
LAURA: Ten.

153
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:33,584
MATT: Okay, yeah, it takes you a little bit, about
ten minutes or so. Parts of it got scattered and

154
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:37,636
lost amongst the rest of the objects left around,
but you manage to reassemble your collection of

155
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:40,240
tea accessories.

156
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,234
LAURA: Yeah, cool, it was a golden cursed tea
set.

157
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:46,349
TRAVIS: Nobody else is concerned about the
commotion that happened behind the trees, and

158
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,095
we're all just like "Hi." What happened?

159
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:53,608
LAURA: There was a big fucking bear. You might
actually not want to look in that cave, because it

160
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:56,756
came out of there and it was rather angry when it
did.

161
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,470
LIAM: What it? What came out?

162
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,533
LAURA: A guardian spirit of the forest.

163
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:04,860
TALIESIN: Just observing the entrance to see if
there's anything written, any type of language on

164
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,458
any of the entrances or otherwise.

165
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,641
MATT: Make an investigation check.

166
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:13,748
MARISHA: As a druid would I know about guardian
animal spirits?

167
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:16,307
LAURA: Yeah, would we have heard anything about
this in our studies?

168
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:21,631
MATT: In your studies? No. You, make a history
check.

169
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:24,453
MARISHA: That's not my strong suit, man.

170
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:26,393
MATT: We'll go with nature.

171
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,634
MARISHA: Oh that's better, okay. 23.

172
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:30,420
TALIESIN: 21.

173
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:37,850
MATT: There are no markings that currently are
visible around the entrance or exit of the cavern

174
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:46,113
itself. It is carved, however, meaning that this
cavern, whether it be natural or not, this

175
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:55,627
entrance has been touched by humanoid hands and
has been refined. You, Keyleth, do know that

176
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:04,803
occasionally on the Material Plane there are
entities, spiritual energies, that gather based on

177
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:12,652
worshipping specific fey spirits and these
creatures over time, these spiritual energies,

178
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:19,235
begin to take the form that their worshipers give
them. It takes a long time for this transition to

179
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:24,061
happen, and essentially these guardian spirits,
usually guarding some sort of a powerful fane, or

180
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:31,418
a magical core or center, they become protector
spirits of that region.

181
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:37,408
MARISHA: So because people just manifested the god
as a bear, it slowly turned into a bear?

182
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:42,726
MATT: It turned into a bear. And they're not gods
per se, but they're powerful entities that guard

183
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:43,900
that element.

184
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,677
MARISHA: Spirit guardians. Okay.

185
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,017
TRAVIS: What's in the cave?

186
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:51,209
LAURA: What's in the cave, Keyleth?

187
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,704
MARISHA: Nothing now, I don't think.

188
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,900
LAURA: There was a spirit bear in there.

189
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,705
LIAM: It was a bear?

190
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:59,255
LAURA: It was a big fucking bear, yeah.

191
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:03,598
MARISHA: It was made out of stars and space
stuff.

192
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,597
TRAVIS: Are you sure you haven't been eating
mushrooms or something?

193
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:11,672
LAURA: Trinket popped out and he saved us.
<i>Trinket</i> fucking saved us, Scanlan!

194
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,305
SAM: Pics or it didn't happen.

195
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:15,500
(laughter)

196
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,852
TRAVIS: That's exactly what I was thinking.

197
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:25,965
LIAM: I go over to Trinket and I surreptitiously
start feeding him biscuits-- you don't know--

198
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:32,182
biscuits that I took from my father's house. Good
boy, that's a good boy. Good job.

199
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:37,758
MATT: They're gone in a matter of moments. Licks
the side of your face, leaving some saliva and crumbs.

200
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:41,852
LIAM: I will always give you that shit. Don't
forget.

201
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,130
MARISHA: Percy, did you find anything in the
cave?

202
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,723
TALIESIN: Nothing of consequence.

203
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:47,335
TRAVIS: How far in did you go?

204
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:54,783
TALIESIN: No, that looks dark and there was a
giant cosmic bear in there.

205
00:15:54,783 --> 00:16:02,530
MARISHA: Would I know if after the spirit guardian
has passed, would he just go back in his cave?

206
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,624
MATT: You don't know that much about the entity.
You've never really encountered one before, you've

207
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:08,239
only heard about them.

208
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,255
LAURA: What about Garmelie. Would he know?

209
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:13,126
MATT: You're welcome to ask him if you want to.

210
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:15,640
LAURA: Hey, Garmelie. What do you know about this
fucking bear?

211
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:22,901
MATT: He's in the very back, just watching you
guys. "I know what you know. It's apparently here

212
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:28,899
"and people leave him little presents, and seemed
pretty scary from the way you describe him, so--"

213
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:32,294
TRAVIS: Did you know he was going to be here at
this cave?

214
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:34,131
MATT: "No, I would have avoided this!"

215
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:36,161
TRAVIS: Somebody insight check that little
bastard.

216
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,288
LAURA: Yeah, I'll insight check that little
bastard.

217
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,095
MATT: Roll insight.

218
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:43,988
TRAVIS: I would do it, but eh.

219
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:45,396
LAURA: 18.

220
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:52,082
MATT: 18? He seems like he's telling the truth.
He's hard to read in general because he's such a

221
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:53,922
strange individual, but yeah.

222
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:57,376
LAURA: I feel like he would've told us to avoid
it.

223
00:16:57,376 --> 00:17:04,250
MARISHA: And bears are fairly territorial. I don't
know, it might be wise to stay out of the cave.

224
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,218
TALIESIN: I think in general it's probably best to
respect anything's home on this plane of

225
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:10,214
existence.

226
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:12,048
TRAVIS: Boring. Scanlan, you want to go in?

227
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,445
SAM: If you do.

228
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:16,745
LIAM: We're not here to go spelunking. Why are we
going to go in this cave?

229
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:20,764
TRAVIS: Oh my god, we're in the Feywild, we're
about to pull a bow out of a tree, and you don't

230
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,517
want to see what's in the creepy cave.

231
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:25,133
LAURA: Maybe we should save our strength for the
fucking bow in the tree.

232
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,236
LIAM: Plus, do you know there's a theater here?

233
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:30,159
MATT: "We're not going to the theater."

234
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:35,382
LIAM: I understand, but just so we don't
accidentally go there, where is it in relation to

235
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:40,267
this tree? Is it on the way?

236
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:49,754
MATT: "I couldn't tell you. Certain things move.
Shift. Change location."

237
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:51,598
SAM: It's a touring production.

238
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:57,517
LIAM: I don't trust anyone who doesn't like the
theater. What exactly is your issue with it?

239
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:03,307
MATT: "Don't worry about it. Anyway. Shall we?"
And he begins marching back.

240
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:07,838
LAURA: I really don't think we should mess with
this thing.

241
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:17,172
MARISHA: Look, Grog, I touched a flower and the
whole realm almost collapsed, okay? I don't know.

242
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:20,733
TRAVIS: I know, I'm looking at the scandalous one
over there that's always trying to get little

243
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,504
goodies for himself.

244
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:28,269
TALIESIN: I'm not feeling this one. I don't know.
What can I tell you? I normally like to gamble and

245
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,982
I'm not feeling a gamble on this one.

246
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:32,236
TRAVIS: All right, you went (boop). I'm just
saying.

247
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,287
TALIESIN: It's just not pretty enough. It's really
not pretty enough. We've already won something here.

248
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,256
TRAVIS: All right, fine. I'm happy.

249
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:44,537
SAM: I'm one hundred percent behind any decision
you made or make, by the way. You say "go," we go.

250
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:46,041
You say "stay," we stay.

251
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,525
TRAVIS: What if we run, touch the back of the
cave, run back. We don't even have to pick up

252
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,003
anything. Just to say we did it.

253
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:56,970
MARISHA: Last time I touched something, I didn't
hear the end of it. And now we're just going to

254
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,362
let this happen?

255
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,539
TALIESIN: Well, yes, because we don't care if they
die.

256
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,048
TRAVIS: What, all the bad shit already came out of
it, what do you say?

257
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:08,192
SAM: By that logic, mathematically there's no more
bad shit in there.

258
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:12,240
TALIESIN: Is there anybody here of reasonable
intelligence who wants to stop this from

259
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,709
happening? Just checking.

260
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:17,510
LIAM: I don't think that we should do anything. It
does seem like a bit of a double standard that

261
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,347
everybody threw poo at Keyleth for picking a
flower.

262
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:25,290
TALIESIN: (deadpan) Please, whatever you do, don't
do it, my god please.

263
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,418
TRAVIS: I know, he's got the raised eyebrows. I'm
not sure if we should do it or not.

264
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,284
MATT: I'm just enjoying the conversation. Make
your choices.

265
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,388
MARISHA: You do you, man. You do you, guys.

266
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:37,336
TALIESIN: If you're going to do it, have a light
source.

267
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:41,008
TRAVIS: What, ten or higher we go?

268
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:44,126
SAM: Ten or higher we go.

269
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,833
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

270
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,715
SAM: (laughing) We're so going.

271
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:50,507
TRAVIS: I put Scanlan on my back, and we run
straight into the cave.

272
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:52,562
TALIESIN: I hand a torch.

273
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:55,376
TRAVIS: I don't want any torch. I've got
darkvision!

274
00:19:55,376 --> 00:20:01,603
MATT: They go darting into the cave, vanishing
into the shadows and out of sight. The two of you

275
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:11,830
continue for about 30, 40, 50, 60 feet.
Thankfully, both of you have darkvision, so you

276
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,314
can see pretty well in this area. You can see what
are a number of alcoves that are carved into the

277
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:23,129
sides of the rock here that contain extinguished
candles, sometimes clusters of them, that are left

278
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:29,516
in here in some sort of ceremonial way, but have
just burned out or not been lit in a long time. It

279
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:34,389
goes straight back; there's no curvature or
natural change in the path of this cavern.

280
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:39,799
You get about 100 feet into the foot of this
spire-like mountain, one of many that protrude

281
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:47,065
from the center of the Moonbrush, and the chamber
widens and comes to an end, a circular pocket at

282
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:54,042
the end, about maybe 40 feet across on each side.
The floor of this room is entirely covered in

283
00:20:54,042 --> 00:21:00,998
unlit candles, except for in the center there is a
raised stone platform that contains a singular

284
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:04,520
skull made of some sort of a bluish or aquamarine
crystal.

285
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,855
SAM: That's not what I was expecting.

286
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:10,116
TRAVIS: Jackpot.

287
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:11,538
SAM: Jackpot?

288
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:17,268
TRAVIS: We are the greatest ones in the group. Are
the candles standing up or are they laying over?

289
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:18,818
MATT: They're standing up.

290
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:22,563
SAM: We can't take the skull.

291
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:26,804
MATT: It's a large skull, it's like this big, and
its elongated snout--

292
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:28,449
SAM: Oh, it's an animal skull.

293
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:29,886
MATT: It's a beast-like skull.

294
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,367
TALIESIN: Is it a bear skull?

295
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,701
TRAVIS: We have not said anything to the rest of
the group.

296
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,315
TALIESIN: Oh, I thought they were saying this out
loud.

297
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:37,956
SAM: Can I discern what kind of animal skull it
is?

298
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:39,479
MATT: Make a nature check.

299
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,951
TRAVIS: Can I do one, as well?

300
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:47,224
MATT: Sure. Yeah, you would. Yeah, as a traveling
herd member, you would know cleaning creatures and stuff.

301
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,472
SAM: Eight.

302
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:53,824
MATT: You have no idea what creature this is. It
does look bestial in nature.

303
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,331
LIAM: Are you dead yet?

304
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,453
SAM: Still alive. Everything's okay. It's all gold
and silver.

305
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:00,348
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's nothing that moves in here.

306
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:09,011
MARISHA: Keyleth talks to the rest who stayed out.
Okay, Percy, do you have an hourglass thing?

307
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,252
TALIESIN: No, but I can keep very good count,
though.

308
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,495
MARISHA: We should play that gambling game.

309
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:15,810
TALIESIN: All right.

310
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,584
MARISHA: Okay. I bet-- how much gold do I have?

311
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:22,341
LAURA: How much gold do you have?

312
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,517
MARISHA: Three gold.

313
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:24,842
LAURA: That's it?

314
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,325
TALIESIN: We keep taking it from her.

315
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:31,527
MARISHA: That's true. That we have to run in after
and save them.

316
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:35,094
LIAM: I don't want to take that bet.

317
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:36,973
MARISHA: You're going to take that bet?

318
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:39,217
LIAM: No, I <i>don't</i> want to take that bet because
I agree with you.

319
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:42,466
TALIESIN: I'll take that bet. I'll take a
three-gold bet.

320
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:45,438
MARISHA: Okay. That they come out safe and sound?

321
00:22:45,438 --> 00:22:46,727
TALIESIN: 200 seconds.

322
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:48,628
MARISHA: 200 seconds. All right.

323
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:54,847
MATT: Meanwhile, inside the cave, the two of you
now stand at the edge of this room filled with

324
00:22:54,847 --> 00:23:01,305
small, wax structures and wicks that are currently
cold in the darkness, and the central platform

325
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:04,019
holding the crystalline skull in the center.

326
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:08,154
TRAVIS: In that circular area, is there anything
on the back wall? More candle sconces?

327
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:14,114
MATT: You can't make out any details. It looks
like somewhat rough cavern walls, but not very

328
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:17,160
smoothly carved or anything.

329
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,297
TRAVIS: And the skull is big, like the size of my
chest?

330
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,125
MATT: It's probably a little bit smaller than
that.

331
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,558
SAM: Made of gems or stone or bone?

332
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:33,452
MATT: It looks almost like it was carved and
hollowed from a singular giant solid piece of opal

333
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:40,418
or aquamarine. Like it's a gemmed skull in the
sense that it's made from gem material.

334
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,787
TRAVIS: Does it look like it could have been a
bear skull?

335
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:47,990
MATT: You don't know, mister nature-roll-of-12.

336
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,453
SAM: Oh god.

337
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,131
TRAVIS: Well.

338
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:55,170
SAM: Listen, Grog. I don't think it's very
valuable.

339
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,924
TRAVIS: No, but look at it!

340
00:23:57,924 --> 00:23:59,545
SAM: It's pretty amazing.

341
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,139
TRAVIS: We're in a secret chamber.

342
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,755
SAM: This is cool. But what would we do with it?
We can't trade it.

343
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:06,641
TRAVIS: I bet they worshiped it.

344
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:12,291
SAM: I bet something still worships it. And that
thing could come back and be mad if we take it.

345
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,161
TRAVIS: Are there a crapload of footprints on the
ground around us?

346
00:24:15,161 --> 00:24:17,608
MATT: Make a perception check.

347
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:20,725
TRAVIS: 13.

348
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:26,854
MATT: It's hard to tell. You've arrived, both
paced in your space there, so there are plenty of

349
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:31,549
footprints that you guys have left. It's hard to
see if there are any more recent ones are from

350
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:33,314
other creatures.

351
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:35,778
TRAVIS: Want to take a candle as a souvenir?

352
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:42,748
SAM: I wouldn't mind getting a closer look at that
skull.

353
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,489
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, let's do that, then.

354
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:46,518
LIAM: 100 seconds have gone by.

355
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,699
SAM: We can't walk over there without disturbing
candles, right?

356
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:57,542
MATT: Probably not, unless you're ballet-style en
pointe.

357
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:07,839
TRAVIS: I can throw you. Taking it back to the old
school. That's a little careless.

358
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,824
SAM: I can grab it. I do have a big hand.

359
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:17,149
TRAVIS: That's like getting your hand on it right
away. It's pushing the button.

360
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:22,291
SAM: What do we do? Do we just leave and come up
with a good story?

361
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:25,037
TRAVIS: Ooh. Yeah.

362
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:28,497
SAM: Okay. Here, how about this: let me cut your
face.

363
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:29,963
TRAVIS: Okay.

364
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:35,985
SAM: When we run out, you'll be bleeding and
crying, and it'll be horrible. And we'll just make

365
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:37,097
something up.

366
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:40,235
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughing) Perfect. Are you ready to
go?

367
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:41,683
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, sure.

368
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:47,766
TRAVIS: We take off-- wait, you've got to cut me.
Wait, where are you going to cut me?

369
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:50,784
SAM: Right above the eyebrow so there's lots of
blood, yeah.

370
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:54,017
TRAVIS: Yeah, right in the middle, like the Bruce
Willis cut. Okay.

371
00:25:54,017 --> 00:25:58,541
MATT: Ah, Sir Bruce Willis of Emon. Dangerous life
he led in history.

372
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:04,300
TRAVIS: But not too deep, right? I want to be able
to still make the ladies swoon.

373
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,129
SAM: Okay, cool. I'll take out my-- not
Mythcarver.

374
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:11,840
TRAVIS: Why not? You were going to cut me with a
Vestige?

375
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,641
LIAM: You're going to roll a 20 and decapitate
him.

376
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:22,265
SAM: I take out my other longsword. My Aberration
Bane longsword.

377
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:24,572
MATT: (laughing) Are you an aberration?

378
00:26:24,572 --> 00:26:28,248
SAM: I'll slice him right over one of the
eyebrows.

379
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:34,899
MATT: Okay. You take one point of damage, and the
goliath blood doth flow aplenty.

380
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:39,050
TRAVIS: (grunting) Are you ready? Let's sell this
shit. And I put him on my back and we take off

381
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,941
running! (yelling) Oh, it's horrible!

382
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:48,115
SAM: (yelling) There are bears everywhere! Bears!
Little bears, big bears!

383
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:52,085
TRAVIS: We burst out into the sunlight, and I
intentionally trip and eat shit. Scanlan goes

384
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:53,813
flying, boom!

385
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,623
SAM: There was a bear right on Grog!

386
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:58,369
TRAVIS: Oh my god! It was so vicious.

387
00:26:58,369 --> 00:26:59,797
SAM: It was horrible.

388
00:26:59,797 --> 00:27:01,680
LAURA: You didn't fight them at all?

389
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,873
TRAVIS: No, there were bodies everywhere!
Children! Women! They were stapled to the ceiling!

390
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:09,191
And then there were just horrible--

391
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:12,428
MARISHA: So did the bear only have one claw?

392
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:14,822
MATT: Make a deception check.

393
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:17,473
LIAM: This guy wants to go to the theater.

394
00:27:17,473 --> 00:27:19,733
TRAVIS: 15.

395
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:23,648
MATT: I'll have the rest of you roll an insight
check.

396
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:27,364
MARISHA: This is the lucky one.

397
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:31,048
LIAM: Oh man, that sounds scary.

398
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,245
LAURA: 23.

399
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:33,838
MARISHA: 27.

400
00:27:33,838 --> 00:27:35,390
TALIESIN: Nine.

401
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:42,962
SAM: I was in the mouth of a bear, and Grog cut
the thing from asshole to lips to get me out of

402
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,574
there. It was crazy!

403
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:48,227
LAURA: That's disgusting. So there was really
nothing there?

404
00:27:48,227 --> 00:27:50,846
MARISHA: I think that means you owe me three gold,
Percy.

405
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:52,333
TALIESIN: (sighing) Oh, bloody hell.

406
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,602
SAM: Did you bet to see whether we would live or
die?

407
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:56,634
TALIESIN: No, not at all.

408
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,124
LAURA: What did you really find in there?

409
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,292
SAM: Some candles.

410
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,739
LAURA: Yeah?

411
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:04,334
TRAVIS: And a big skull.

412
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:13,296
SAM: Big skull. A gemmed skull. Not gemmed. A
gem-like skull. Not diamonds, not rubies. Opal.

413
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,673
Something.

414
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,026
TRAVIS: We reached out to touch it and it cut my
face.

415
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:21,631
LAURA: That sounds terrible. I wish Pike was here;
she would really enjoy this story.

416
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:25,369
SAM: It was a worthless endeavor. We're sorry we
went.

417
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:28,992
LIAM: Hey, how about that Chroma Conclave, eh?

418
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:33,695
TALIESIN: Wait, so the candles and skulls were
there, or they weren't there?

419
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:37,087
TRAVIS: Yeah, there were a ton of candles and a
skull.

420
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:40,202
SAM: Seems like a place of worship or devotion,
and we didn't want to mess with it.

421
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:45,053
MARISHA: Well a lot of these spirit guardians tend
to have worshipers, and a lot of times they'll

422
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:48,737
bring them gifts, so that makes sense. Yeah, I
probably should have told you guys that before you

423
00:28:48,737 --> 00:28:50,440
went in, sorry.

424
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,147
TRAVIS: There's only one show in a day; we don't
want to miss it.

425
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:55,783
LAURA: I like how all of us sound like we've lost
our voice.

426
00:28:55,783 --> 00:29:02,717
MARISHA: Yeah, it sounds like we've all been
through hell. Okay.

427
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:06,681
TRAVIS: Well, since I touched the skull and I cut
myself, could you do me a little. (clicks tongue)

428
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:08,784
LAURA: You want me to lick it?

429
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:11,068
TRAVIS: No, don't you have a thing?

430
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:15,002
LAURA: Like healing? Like you want me to use a
whole spell on this teensy-ass wuss cut?

431
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:17,184
TRAVIS: If you care about me.

432
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,611
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on his little
teeny-weeny cut.

433
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:24,263
TRAVIS: Oh, that feels so much better.

434
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:29,300
SAM: Vex, what do you think, is a semi-precious
gemstone skull worth going in and getting?

435
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,540
LAURA: I think we should remember this place is--
well, it's probably going to disappear after we

436
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,739
walk away. These things tend to move, don't they?

437
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:40,475
LIAM: We should move toward our destination.

438
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:44,623
LAURA: We need to focus on the bow. And it's
really hard to say that, but I really--

439
00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:49,232
TALIESIN: The whole theory of a path is you're
supposed to somewhat stay on it, I imagine.

440
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,534
LAURA: So stay on it.

441
00:29:51,534 --> 00:29:57,018
LIAM: No more stops. Unless it's for the theater,
we're not stopping again.

442
00:29:57,018 --> 00:29:58,607
SAM: What time is it?

443
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:03,653
MATT: From what you can tell, it looks like it's
in the evening, with the moon up.

444
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:07,573
SAM: And we've been awake for a while?

445
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:12,759
MATT: Full journey here since you rested... make
an intelligence check.

446
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:21,296
SAM: Natural 20, except disadvantage because I'm
exhausted. 16 plus two.

447
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:30,801
MATT: Okay. After resting just outside of the
Moonbrush, it's probably been three hours since

448
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:32,011
you woke.

449
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:33,199
SAM: Oh.

450
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,571
TRAVIS: We're good.

451
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:35,818
LAURA: Oh, we rested?

452
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:38,063
MATT: Did you guys push on when you got there?

453
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:40,171
LIAM: I was wondering the same thing.

454
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,164
MARISHA: I thought we camped on the outskirts.

455
00:30:43,164 --> 00:30:46,236
TALIESIN: Whatever we decide right now is exactly
what happened.

456
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:48,387
MARISHA: Right, so we camped and we got up,
right?

457
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:50,014
TALIESIN: Yes. What? Yes, of course.

458
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,669
TRAVIS: I agree.

459
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:54,533
MATT: I feel like there would have camping before
going straight into the Moonbrush, and I think you

460
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:57,963
may have been pressed for time at the event last
time to try and do that.

461
00:30:57,963 --> 00:31:03,864
SAM: All I know is my mansion spell has been
ticked off. So I used it at least once in the last

462
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:05,552
47 hours.

463
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:08,705
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like we camped out right
before we went into the Moonbrush.

464
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:11,415
TALIESIN: We camped out right before that.

465
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:16,519
MATT: Right, so it's been a few hours since you
regained consciousness. It wouldn't have made a

466
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:22,428
huge difference, per se, but you were still
reading the book. You're close now, at this point.

467
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:23,965
SAM: Yeah, I'm close.

468
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,464
MATT: A handful of hours away from completing it.

469
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,600
LAURA: So I can take off this negative seven hit
points that I don't even remember how I got,

470
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,062
probably.

471
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,674
MATT: Actually, that you would have gotten from
the large bear, so no.

472
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:34,834
LAURA: You're right.

473
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:45,462
MATT: Nice try. All right, so as you guys gather
here, Garmelie goes, "All right, so duskward is--

474
00:31:45,462 --> 00:31:50,678
"that way. Who's leading?"

475
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:52,391
TALIESIN: You are.

476
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:54,061
MATT: "Oh, I'm not leading. I'm guiding you."

477
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:57,054
LAURA: You guide. In the front.

478
00:31:57,054 --> 00:32:04,928
MATT: "I'm guiding you duskward. I've never been
inside the Moonbrush! I know of things around it."

479
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:08,651
LAURA: How were you planning to guide us through
it if you don't even know how to do it?

480
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:11,292
SAM: He was just going to get us to the outskirts.
That was always the plan.

481
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:14,563
MATT: "I'm getting you to your destination by
helping guide you there."

482
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:18,526
MARISHA: But if you can't guide us through the
Moonbrush--

483
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:21,891
MATT: "I am guiding you through the Moonbrush, I
just think somebody should take the lead."

484
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:23,908
MARISHA: But you said you've never been here.

485
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,888
TALIESIN: He wants something big in the front.

486
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:30,530
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm just wondering what his use
will be from here on out.

487
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,560
LAURA: How about you and I, we can be in the
front.

488
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,653
LIAM: She's Duchess of the Grape Hunt so she's
very good to lead.

489
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:38,267
MATT: "Great, wondrous. That'll work fine."

490
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:42,115
LAURA: Duchess of the Grape Hunt, what a wonderful
title.

491
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:48,162
MARISHA: Hang on a second, Garmelie. Huddle real
quick. Why don't we send him home? He could die.

492
00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:50,225
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

493
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:55,588
MARISHA: He's not going to be any use from here on
out. He's never been here.

494
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:58,404
SAM: He knows things about the Feywild that we
don't know.

495
00:32:58,404 --> 00:33:00,692
LAURA: The only thing I worry about is we made a
deal with him.

496
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:05,588
TALIESIN: He's under contract, which means that
there are places and things he might be able to

497
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:06,714
help us with.

498
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:07,881
LAURA: He shook our hand.

499
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,299
TRAVIS: Yeah, it couldn't hurt.

500
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:10,820
TALIESIN: It's worth having him.

501
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,495
SAM: Also, if it turns out he's not who he says he
is--

502
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:16,320
MARISHA: Which I'm starting to get a very strong
feeling of.

503
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,418
SAM: We'll find out who he really is later.

504
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:23,747
LIAM: He's a bit of a sneak, too. The only reason
we have him is because you spotted him

505
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:25,805
because you're awesome.

506
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:28,271
TRAVIS: And he wanted a hat, how bad could he
honestly be?

507
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:30,603
LAURA: Right? It looks very good on him.

508
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:33,805
TALIESIN: I feel like hats are almost a
traditional sign of something a little iffy.

509
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,560
Present company included, of course.

510
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:47,566
MARISHA: We got betrayed by Clarota at the 11th
hour, so--

511
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:51,872
LIAM: We're so much cooler now.

512
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,437
SAM: All right, let's just put Vex and Vax.

513
00:33:55,437 --> 00:33:57,193
LAURA: Hold my hand, dear?

514
00:33:57,193 --> 00:34:00,526
MATT: "All right." He takes your hand. Roll a
survival check.

515
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:03,230
LIAM: He eats her hand.

516
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,156
LAURA: 17.

517
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:12,393
MATT: 17, okay. Holding your hand, you guys
quietly begin to make your way through the

518
00:34:12,393 --> 00:34:13,908
Moonbrush.

519
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:18,971
LAURA: Eyes out for any things.

520
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:21,185
MATT: You're in your natural element, also. It's a
forest.

521
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:25,256
SAM: Grog, can I ride on you?

522
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:28,159
TRAVIS: Girl, you can always ride.

523
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,567
SAM: Yeah, I just need to be reading.

524
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:38,335
MATT: Much like a kid in the backseat of a car on
a cell phone, Scanlan is just reading through the

525
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:40,116
book on the back of Grog.

526
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:41,954
MARISHA: Station wagon. Facing backwards.

527
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,102
LAURA: You can always ride on Trinket, too,
Scanlan.

528
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:48,520
SAM: No. Grog weirdly smells better than Trinket
today.

529
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:56,048
MATT: About another two hours of travel duskward,
and he's keeping a finger pointed in the

530
00:34:56,048 --> 00:35:03,120
direction, which is difficult for you because the
moon placement in the sky has not changed. The

531
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,277
correlation as to what you normally use in the
Prime Material Plane to gauge direction has no use

532
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:16,607
here whatsoever. So the best that you can do is
try to keep yourself facing forward and using his

533
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,769
occasional guidance to steer back on track.

534
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:22,427
LAURA: I'm going to try to learn from him how he's
gauging his surroundings and stuff.

535
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:24,344
MATT: Make an insight check.

536
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:32,246
LAURA: 21.

537
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:37,816
MATT: 21. He seems to, every single time he checks
for the direction, lick his finger and then point.

538
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:43,015
There's nothing more to it than that. He'll take a
moment to think and look around, lick his finger,

539
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,345
point in a direction.

540
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:49,226
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if I feel
a breeze at all, or is he bullshitting?

541
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:52,382
LIAM: Are they way ahead of us or are they just up
ahead?

542
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,739
MARISHA: 16.

543
00:35:54,739 --> 00:36:00,329
MATT: There is no breeze. There is no sound in the
forest here. There is no sound of leaves

544
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,070
clattering. He's just doing that.

545
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,135
MARISHA: Because it makes him seem smart.

546
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:07,212
LAURA: What does the licking do?

547
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:14,659
MATT: "Licking is how I initiate the
specialization of my arcane understanding of the

548
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:17,426
"flow and ebb of the fey--"

549
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,917
LAURA: You're bullshitting.

550
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:24,185
MATT: "No! This is a technique. And it's leading
us to your destination. Have a little faith. You

551
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:25,471
"hired me for a reason."

552
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:27,242
LAURA: So much faith in you.

553
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:29,159
LIAM: Is he taking us to the theater right now?

554
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,637
LAURA: Definitely the theater.

555
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:35,984
MATT: "Not the theater!" Pressing on, I want you
to make another survival check.

556
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:43,213
LAURA: Natural 20. And I don't even need to roll
again.

557
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:45,399
MATT: All right.

558
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:56,768
MARISHA: As we go, I just want to Druidcraft
little green pebbles. No, let's do brighter-- red

559
00:36:56,768 --> 00:37:00,323
pebbles to start leaving behind Hansel and Gretel
style.

560
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:04,028
TRAVIS: Lead something right to us.

561
00:37:04,028 --> 00:37:09,733
MARISHA: Little pebbles. Tiny pebbles that I can
recognize.

562
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:13,154
MATT: Okay, so you're creating small stones that
trail behind you as you go.

563
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:16,269
MARISHA: Every hundred feet or so.

564
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:22,717
MATT: As you guys progress forward, you start
finding patches where the ground itself gets a

565
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:30,611
little mushier, like either there's a nearby river or
the ground itself has retained liquid more than

566
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:36,304
other areas of the forest. You begin to see the
faint appearance of familiar green sprouts that

567
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:41,085
come through. These are mandrakes, and you manage
to catch them before the rest of the party gets

568
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:45,127
there, you and Garmelie, especially with your
sight and knowledge of this area, you manage to

569
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:50,180
guide the party around that whole field of waiting
mandrake.

570
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,400
LAURA: What do they do? Do they just scream a
lot?

571
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:02,477
MATT: You don't know. You may find out yet.
Progressing forward into the next section, I need

572
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,108
you to make another survival check.

573
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:13,710
LAURA: Oh no. 12. Oh, double-double! That's
better! 25.

574
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:22,157
MATT: 25! Shit, girl. Eventually, you come to what
appears to be a river that's cutting through this

575
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:31,283
portion of the Moonbrush. Just on the other side
of that river, you hear a faint sound of music.

576
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:34,196
MARISHA: The theater!

577
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:35,989
LAURA: (whispering) What is that?

578
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:39,955
MATT: "What is what? I don't--"

579
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:42,592
LAURA: The music, do you hear it?

580
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:44,199
MATT: "No?"

581
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,875
TRAVIS: Hold on, are you saying you don't hear
anything right now?

582
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,993
MATT: Actually, right now nobody hears it except
for you.

583
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,331
LAURA: What does it sound like?

584
00:38:51,331 --> 00:39:02,085
MATT: It sounds like a soft violin, with a hint of
flute, and a drum beat. It's very simple. It's

585
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:05,257
very basic.

586
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:07,124
LAURA: Does it sound pleasant?

587
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:11,614
MATT: It does sound pleasant. It sounds folksy and
whimsical. It's very, very faint.

588
00:39:11,614 --> 00:39:14,726
LAURA: There must be people further in.

589
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:17,728
SAM: You hear music?

590
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:19,458
LAURA: Yes.

591
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,684
TALIESIN: Could be dangerous.

592
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:22,021
SAM: Can I listen?

593
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:25,821
MATT: The rest of you guys, as you gather up, you
begin to hear the sound and so does Garmelie.

594
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,180
Garmelie's like, "We really don't need to go in
that direction."

595
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,807
LAURA: Do you know anything about music playing
randomly in the woods?

596
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:39,717
MATT: "Music can be good, it can be bad. Who
knows? Dangerous music is very often a thing in

597
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:44,307
"places you don't understand. I would not recommend
wandering into places of phantom music."

598
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:46,328
TRAVIS: We should check it out.

599
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:48,760
SAM: I want to hear some music.

600
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,469
LAURA: What direction is it coming from?

601
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:57,410
MATT: You take a few steps. There is still a
river, which is about 15 feet across. It's a soggy

602
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:05,746
bank that leads into a lazily running river. So
you have to cross that first. It looks to be a

603
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,082
little ways duskward and to your right.

604
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:09,200
TRAVIS: Have to cross the river.

605
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,388
LIAM: We don't need to stick a stick into every
beehive we come across.

606
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:14,874
SAM: But this is the theater.

607
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:16,199
LIAM: Is it the theater?

608
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,997
TALIESIN: We don't know actually know. It could be
anything.

609
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:19,776
LAURA: It could also be a camp.

610
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:21,133
TALIESIN: It could be many things.

611
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:23,256
SAM: Do I recognize the music?

612
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:31,127
MATT: You don't, actually. It's not a classic
ditty. The structures are familiar. You can see

613
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:38,153
where the basis of a lot of bar shanties come
from; a similar bouncing beat to it, but nothing

614
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:40,050
that catches you as really familiar.

615
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,024
LAURA: (whispered) Ugh. I want to see what it is
that's doing it, though.

616
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,220
TRAVIS: Right, but we got to cross this river to
get to it.

617
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,703
LAURA: We have to do it regardless, yes.

618
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:48,245
MARISHA: How big is the river?

619
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,520
MATT: 15 feet across.

620
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,447
SAM: It's a stream. It's nothing.

621
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:56,427
TRAVIS: He said it's lazy, right? It's just going
along, but I call bullshit 'cause we're in the

622
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:58,049
Feywild.

623
00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:00,974
TALIESIN: You're very clever about that.

624
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:03,463
LIAM: You said we have to get across, regardless,
Garmelie?

625
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:07,003
MATT: "Well, yes, if we're heading toward your
destination, we have to cross."

626
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:09,149
MARISHA: We have to get across the river,
regardless?

627
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:10,882
SAM: Can you make us a bridge, Keyleth?

628
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:14,465
MARISHA: I can control water and part the river
for a second.

629
00:41:14,465 --> 00:41:16,915
SAM: Well, that's even better.

630
00:41:16,915 --> 00:41:18,717
LAURA: For a hot second?

631
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:28,777
MARISHA: For a hot second, yeah, I was trying to
stop myself. I cast Control Water and make us a

632
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,771
little bubble as we walk.

633
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:33,003
MATT: Okay. So you watch as the stream begins to
separate--

634
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:43,618
MARISHA: I don't want to Moses this, I want to
give us a little bubble that we stealthily walk

635
00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:46,851
under the river with the little bubble.

636
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:50,656
MATT: You guys find your way, walking down onto
the bank of the river, your boots sinking into the

637
00:41:50,656 --> 00:42:00,068
very soft, soggy bottom of the river. You walk
across, make your way to the other side. The river

638
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:07,066
splashes as the bubble is no longer required. You
traverse it; no issue. It's a river. The music is

639
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,892
a little louder on this side of the bank and is
off to the right side.

640
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:13,261
SAM: Should we send Vax ahead?

641
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:17,892
LIAM: I don't think it's a good idea but if we're
going to check it out you and I should go ahead.

642
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:19,444
Yeah, let's go.

643
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:23,074
LAURA: Garmelie? Do you want to come with us? Go
invisible?

644
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:29,020
MATT: "Um. Okay?"

645
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,630
LAURA: I will hold your hand, don't worry dear.

646
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:38,684
MATT: "All right." So he vanishes from sight. The
two of you guys make your stealth checks.

647
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:45,286
LAURA: Oh, can I cast Pass Without a Trace on us?

648
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:47,347
MATT: If you want to.

649
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:49,203
LAURA: I'm going to do that.

650
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,395
LIAM: All right.

651
00:42:50,395 --> 00:42:52,599
MATT: All right, so adding plus ten to your
stealth rolls.

652
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,871
LIAM: 39.

653
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,323
LAURA: Whoa. 28.

654
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,627
MATT: All right. The rest of you are staying
behind.

655
00:42:57,627 --> 00:42:58,910
MARISHA: Yeah.

656
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:07,399
MATT: So you two and Garmelie make your way
upwards, pushing past bushes, and the trees here

657
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:16,401
in the Moonbrush, which are getting thicker and
thicker the further north you go. You hear the

658
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:22,419
music getting louder and louder, and it's funny.
You find yourself tapping the side of your leg to

659
00:43:22,419 --> 00:43:31,639
it. It's a nice beat. You begin to hear laughter.
Sounds like jovial laughter, like people having a

660
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:36,415
good time. Just a few voices. You hear two
different voices going back and forth, laughing.

661
00:43:36,415 --> 00:43:44,613
LIAM: Our mother read us stories about shit like
this.

662
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:45,811
LAURA: Did she?

663
00:43:45,811 --> 00:43:47,888
LIAM: Yes, she did.

664
00:43:47,888 --> 00:43:49,925
LAURA: I don't remember.

665
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:55,514
LIAM: Fairies. Grumpkins. I don't know. It's
probably going to end badly. Do you want to go

666
00:43:55,514 --> 00:43:57,398
have a look?

667
00:43:57,398 --> 00:44:00,009
LAURA: I just wanted to see, but if you're worried
about it, we don't have to.

668
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:04,622
SAM: Oi! You lot! I just had a thought.

669
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:07,195
LIAM: Why start now?

670
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:10,332
SAM: If there's music, there could be some sort of
charm effect.

671
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:12,935
LAURA: Oh.

672
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:17,075
SAM: Would you like me to come with and maybe
counter that charm effect?

673
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:20,012
MARISHA: The bard is just now figuring this out?

674
00:44:20,012 --> 00:44:22,661
LAURA: Get on up here, you stealthy fuck.

675
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:27,456
SAM: All right, I put down my book and hop off of
Grog and go up there.

676
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,998
MARISHA: I sit down with Percy.

677
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:30,959
LAURA: Add ten to it because of Pass Without a
Trace.

678
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,509
SAM: I don't think you cast it on me, did you?

679
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:34,520
LAURA: I cast it on everybody that's within 30
feet of me.

680
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,878
SAM: Am I there yet? I'm exhausted.

681
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,767
MATT: Yeah, it's at disadvantage.

682
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:46,948
SAM: Same. What is it?

683
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:48,716
TALIESIN: Stealth. Plus ten.

684
00:44:48,716 --> 00:44:51,666
SAM: Oh! Hey, that's 18! That's not bad.

685
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:55,583
LAURA: Would have been eight?! Jesus.

686
00:44:55,583 --> 00:45:06,994
MARISHA: I sit down with Percy and I say: six gold
that after 200 seconds, they run out screaming

687
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:08,219
again.

688
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:14,650
SAM: Can I be doing Countercharm? Can I hum a
little tune? Is that how it works? I don't know

689
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,098
how it works!

690
00:45:16,098 --> 00:45:25,949
MATT: Well, it's time for you to learn how one of
your abilities works here, Sam. For countercharm:

691
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:29,263
as an action, you set up a performance that lasts
until the end of your next turn. During that time,

692
00:45:29,263 --> 00:45:30,892
you and any friendly creature--

693
00:45:30,892 --> 00:45:32,321
SAM: It lasts six seconds?!

694
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:42,420
MATT: Hold on. You can keep doing it every round
if you want to. It doesn't say there's a limit to it.

695
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,493
SAM: All right. I'll keep humming.

696
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:52,027
MATT: They have to hear you to be affected by it.
It has to be loud enough for them to hear you.

697
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:54,092
SAM: Sure. I'll hum loudly.

698
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:55,642
LIAM: You want to break our stealth?

699
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:56,562
MATT: It's going to happen.

700
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:57,616
SAM: Shit.

701
00:45:57,616 --> 00:46:00,503
MATT: Yeah, one way or the other. You've got
countercharm or keeping stealthed.

702
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:02,328
LAURA: Aw, fuck.

703
00:46:02,328 --> 00:46:07,223
SAM: We'll stealth, and if it starts to feel icky,
then I'll do it.

704
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,704
LAURA: Okay. All right.

705
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:13,846
I basically just want to see what the fuck
is laughing. I want to see what it is.

706
00:46:13,846 --> 00:46:18,360
LIAM: If I do not see a mummer's show from this,
there will be hell to pay. Now let's go.

707
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:25,652
MATT: So the three of you and Garmelie, who's
invisible at this point in time, you approach what

708
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:31,725
looks to be a clearing ahead of you now. The trees
actually disperse a bit. You can see what appears

709
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:35,357
to be a small campfire that's crackling in the
center of this clearing. And the music is actually

710
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:43,730
quite loud now. You see figures jaunting around
this fire and holding hands and swirling for a

711
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,874
second and then separating. Then dancing a little
ways around it again.

712
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:50,130
LAURA: What kind of figures?

713
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,582
MATT: You have to get closer.

714
00:46:51,582 --> 00:46:54,373
LAURA: Fuck! Fuck this. Fuck it. I'm not doing
it.

715
00:46:54,373 --> 00:46:56,239
LIAM: I will go closer.

716
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,885
LAURA: No. Don't fucking go closer. I get a really
bad feeling. All of a sudden, I get a really bad

717
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:01,531
feeling about this.

718
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:06,415
LIAM: 39 stealth.

719
00:47:06,415 --> 00:47:08,998
LAURA: I'm behind a tree.

720
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:12,438
MATT: You're behind a tree. Garmelie is staying
with you. What are you doing?

721
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:19,735
SAM: Can I sing to him through the earring? No, we
talked about that before.

722
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:23,596
MATT: No, the effect has to be within hearing, so
either you go up with him or you stay behind.

723
00:47:23,596 --> 00:47:25,963
SAM: I'm going to stay behind.

724
00:47:25,963 --> 00:47:33,366
MATT: Okay. So Vax, you come up to the very edge
of the clearing. You vanish. You come to the very

725
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:40,616
edge of the clearing. You see before you where the
laughter's coming from. There is an elf, in full

726
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:47,334
Verdant Guard armor of Syngorn, who is skipping
and laughing around the fire, dancing alongside

727
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:55,964
what appears to be a bipedal humanoid creature
covered in fur with claws, a longer snout. And

728
00:47:55,964 --> 00:48:01,222
they are both smiling and holding each other's
hands and spinning and twirling each other. And

729
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:02,757
dancing around.

730
00:48:02,757 --> 00:48:05,706
LAURA: They're totally charmed.

731
00:48:05,706 --> 00:48:14,770
MATT: You see the music is actually coming from a
floating spectral violin, flute and drum, unmanned

732
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:20,712
by any creature; just slowly drifting around the
clearing, around the entities that are dancing. I

733
00:48:20,712 --> 00:48:22,592
also need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

734
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:24,090
MARISHA: Ah, there it is!

735
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,642
LAURA: Oh, jeez! Is it a charm effect?

736
00:48:25,642 --> 00:48:28,015
LIAM: Yeah, is it? Because I have advantage if
it's a charm effect.

737
00:48:28,015 --> 00:48:29,173
MATT: You do.

738
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:39,893
LIAM: And I'll use one Luck for the day. First
Luck. All right. 17.

739
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:49,205
MATT: 17. Okay. Looking forward, you find a
tapping on the side of your hip as the beat finds

740
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:56,717
you. And you begin to drift out of the shadows
into the center of this clearing. You look over

741
00:48:56,717 --> 00:49:03,932
and see as the guard extends his hand and takes
yours. The beat kicks into you, a smile creeps

742
00:49:03,932 --> 00:49:05,139
across your face--

743
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:07,591
LAURA: I take my broom out and I start flying up
and I grab Scanlan's hand and take him on the

744
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:08,569
broom with me.

745
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:09,535
SAM: Where we going?

746
00:49:09,535 --> 00:49:10,935
LAURA: We're going to fucking get Vax out of
there.

747
00:49:10,935 --> 00:49:12,076
SAM: I start singing.

748
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:13,399
MATT: Okay.

749
00:49:13,399 --> 00:49:16,327
SAM: Countercharm. (jazzy saxophone riff)

750
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:25,266
MATT: The gentle sounds of Careless Whisper
keeping any possible invasion of your mind at bay,

751
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:31,837
hopefully. You just hear Garmelie behind you going
"No! What are you doing?!" echoing through the

752
00:49:31,837 --> 00:49:36,132
trees as you guys dart in towards the center of
this camp. You--

753
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:39,466
LIAM: I'm on, man. I'm lit.

754
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:43,791
MATT: You are totally on. This is an amazing
experience. You feel the color and the music

755
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:49,863
surging through you, and all through this endless
surge of energy inside as you begin to now join

756
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:51,646
into this other dancing trio.

757
00:49:51,646 --> 00:49:53,442
LIAM: Fucking werewolf guy look good.

758
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:58,505
MATT: Yeah. You guys dart into the center of this,
hearing the music, hearing the laughter, watching

759
00:49:58,505 --> 00:50:06,059
your brother with a Joker-like smile on his face,
the sheer joy pulling his expression into one of a

760
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:13,157
very disturbing joy. I need both of you guys to
make wisdom saving throws with advantage.

761
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:18,478
LIAM: Oh dear.

762
00:50:18,478 --> 00:50:22,713
TALIESIN: Advantage versus magic.

763
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,816
SAM: Yeah, I already had advantage.

764
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:26,294
TALIESIN: Well, there you go.

765
00:50:26,294 --> 00:50:27,404
SAM: 13.

766
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:29,519
LAURA: 23.

767
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:40,439
MATT: 23? All right. You sweep in at this point,
and find that Scanlan jumps off the broom.

768
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:42,083
LAURA: No! Don't jump off the broom!

769
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:45,616
MATT: You tumble down. Make an athletics check.
Acrobatics.

770
00:50:45,616 --> 00:50:50,562
SAM: Save? Check? Ten. Check or save?

771
00:50:50,562 --> 00:50:51,749
MATT: Check.

772
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:53,957
SAM: Ten.

773
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:58,999
MATT: Okay. You catch yourself. It wasn't a large
fall. You land on your feet down on the ground

774
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:05,345
with a crunch. A number of things crunch and break
beneath your feet as you stand up and you look up

775
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:16,326
and see as Vax, this elvish warrior knight, and a
straight-up wolfman all lead you into the dance,

776
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:20,865
and the four of you now begin to take each other's
hands and laugh and skip around in a circle.

777
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:23,316
LAURA: I'm going to try to PokÃ©ball Vax into my
necklace.

778
00:51:23,316 --> 00:51:25,015
MATT: Okay.

779
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,798
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to do that.

780
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:30,853
TALIESIN: I'm hearing this cacophony, and I'm
slowly getting up with a sigh and moving in the

781
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:32,432
direction of the campsite.

782
00:51:32,432 --> 00:51:34,379
MARISHA: You might have won this bet this time,
Percy.

783
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:35,481
LAURA: Not yet!

784
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:37,210
TALIESIN: Slow walk. You've got time.

785
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,914
MARISHA: I'm holding onto my six gold.

786
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:43,489
LAURA: You have to make a wisdom saving throw
against me.

787
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:45,001
LIAM: Okay.

788
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:51,638
LAURA: Why'd you roll twice?

789
00:51:51,638 --> 00:51:53,977
LIAM: Because I have advantage against charm.

790
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,668
LAURA: It's not charm! It was just wisdom.

791
00:51:55,668 --> 00:51:57,029
LIAM: Oh, then I rolled shit. It's just a five.

792
00:51:57,029 --> 00:51:58,566
LAURA: Then he goes in the PokÃ©ball!

793
00:51:58,566 --> 00:52:05,556
MATT: You are pulled into the necklace. I'm really
going to push to refer to it as a necklace.

794
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:10,343
LAURA: Sorry, necklace. The Raven's Slumber
necklace.

795
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:17,508
MATT: I'm going to really push to have it be
called a necklace. Vax, all of a sudden you're

796
00:52:17,508 --> 00:52:22,354
pulled out of this dance, and your head is clouded
for a second as you find yourself in a singular

797
00:52:22,354 --> 00:52:28,729
darkened stone room. Four walls, a single stone
throne in the center of it facing out towards a

798
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:35,744
glass window the size of the other walls. It shows
an image of the perspective of the necklace.

799
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:37,741
LIAM: First conscious person to go in here.

800
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:39,567
MATT: Second, technically.

801
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,158
MARISHA: Second to Grog.

802
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,580
LIAM: Grog was unconscious.

803
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,773
TRAVIS: No, I wasn't.

804
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:45,485
SAM: He was very close to death.

805
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:48,264
LAURA: Can I grab Scanlan?

806
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:50,203
MATT: You can.

807
00:52:50,203 --> 00:52:53,554
SAM: I'm doing the Russian Bottle Dance from
Fiddler on the Roof right now.

808
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:54,881
MATT: It's fantastic.

809
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,671
LAURA: I want to fly down and get him around the
waist and pull him out.

810
00:52:57,671 --> 00:53:02,057
MATT: Make an athletics check. I need you to make
an acrobatics check.

811
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:04,464
SAM: Check?

812
00:53:04,464 --> 00:53:07,207
MATT: Yes, so roll and add your acrobatics with
disadvantage.

813
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:10,612
SAM: 11.

814
00:53:10,612 --> 00:53:11,997
LAURA: Athletics?

815
00:53:11,997 --> 00:53:13,160
MATT: Yes.

816
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:20,894
LAURA: Oh, that's strength, isn't it? Oh, sorry.
17.

817
00:53:20,894 --> 00:53:27,011
MATT: 17. You manage to grab Scanlan, pull him
onto the broom with you. The two other dancers

818
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:34,883
immediately reach up and grab him and try to pull
him back down into it. At this point, you look

819
00:53:34,883 --> 00:53:40,934
into their faces and you can see, while they have
smiles on them, their eyes are fearful and

820
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:46,045
desperate, their bodies are emaciated and
exhausted. They both look like their physical

821
00:53:46,045 --> 00:53:53,040
bodies are on the edge of collapse from nonstop
dancing for god knows how long. You glance down at

822
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:01,683
the ground around you, and you can see numerous
piles of broken bones and discarded armor. All

823
00:54:01,683 --> 00:54:10,377
order of other creatures that have befallen this
spot amongst the forest and never left. They're

824
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:16,359
pulling against you. We're making opposed strength
checks. Go ahead and roll.

825
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:18,797
MARISHA: Come on, Vex.

826
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,672
LAURA: Fuck. I'm so weak, you guys.

827
00:54:20,672 --> 00:54:24,018
MATT: So are they right now, though. They're
heavily emaciated.

828
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:30,255
LAURA: Just a regular strength check? It's not a
saving throw?

829
00:54:30,255 --> 00:54:31,617
MATT: Nope.

830
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:32,936
LAURA: 11.

831
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:40,159
MATT: 11. You feel as Scanlan, who was shoving off
of you instinctually and both of these bodies

832
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,317
grabbing his legs and pulling him down off the
broom, he is pulled from your grasp, hits the

833
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:49,444
ground, and the three of them continue their
dance, completely nonchalant. Not even paying

834
00:54:49,444 --> 00:54:51,006
attention to your presence at this point.

835
00:54:51,006 --> 00:55:01,854
LAURA: I fly away. Minor problem. It was really a
very bad idea to go towards the music. However,

836
00:55:01,854 --> 00:55:06,866
Scanlan's enchanted, and we should probably save
him because it looks like a lot of people have

837
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:12,296
also been enchanted and are stuck there forever.
If you're going to come and try to save him, plug

838
00:55:12,296 --> 00:55:16,930
your fucking ears, because I have a feeling this
music is cursed. And I start shoving shit in my ears.

839
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:19,590
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can you Druidcraft some
cotton?

840
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,107
MARISHA: Sure. You owe me six gold.

841
00:55:22,107 --> 00:55:24,518
TALIESIN: No, we're going to save them. You owe me
six gold.

842
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:30,480
MARISHA: But she's running back out screaming!
Three and three, we split the gold three-three. It

843
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,856
was a draw.

844
00:55:31,856 --> 00:55:35,427
TALIESIN: Vex, could you go fetch a pail of
water?

845
00:55:35,427 --> 00:55:54,789
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. How about this, you
guys... I believe, as an elemental, I'm immune to

846
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:57,015
charm effects.

847
00:55:57,015 --> 00:56:00,017
LAURA: Well, then fucking get in there and help
him.

848
00:56:00,017 --> 00:56:03,189
SAM: You should do more than believe that. You
should probably know that.

849
00:56:03,189 --> 00:56:05,405
LAURA: Maybe be an elemental and shove some shit
in your ears.

850
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:07,621
TRAVIS: If I got into a rage, I can't be charmed.

851
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:09,132
MARISHA: That's true!

852
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:16,158
TALIESIN: There's nothing to be done about that.
It's a campsite, correct? I'm going to start

853
00:56:16,158 --> 00:56:20,076
wandering until at least I have a sense of the
size of it.

854
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,804
MARISHA: You're right. I Druidcraft the cotton.

855
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:31,517
MATT: All right, cool. You guys all make your way
back towards the direction of this little opening,

856
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,914
this gap in this grove.

857
00:56:33,914 --> 00:56:45,848
LAURA: I'm going to let him out of the PokÃ©ball
before we get him out!

858
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:56,864
SAM: There seems to be some distortion going on.
I'm doing that thing with the wolfman where I'm

859
00:56:56,864 --> 00:57:02,241
miming a lasso and pulling him closer to me to
dance closer.

860
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:13,288
MATT: Sure, and they're into it. It is unlike a
song you've ever heard, and everything else fades

861
00:57:13,288 --> 00:57:18,794
away: memory of your friends all drift out of your
mind. All that matters is this moment, this dance,

862
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:24,574
these people and the music. Any semblance of the
personality of Scanlan that existed before is not

863
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:31,899
there. All you feel is the muscles tensing and
relaxing from the ever-present dance. The rest of

864
00:57:31,899 --> 00:57:35,585
you slowly begin to approach the outside of this
opening.

865
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:40,570
LIAM: She just dumped me out. It's not my call.

866
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,472
MATT: Are you dumping him out or not?

867
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:46,267
LAURA: I'm afraid because of the music's still
playing. What if you're still charmed? I'm not

868
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:47,529
going to dump him out.

869
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:48,928
MATT: She keeps him in the necklace.

870
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:52,541
TALIESIN: Just the basic features of the area.

871
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,529
MATT: Perception check.

872
00:57:54,529 --> 00:57:56,716
TALIESIN: Come on.

873
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:59,734
LIAM: I'm in the necklace krumping right now.

874
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:02,145
TALIESIN: That would be ten.

875
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:08,434
MATT: It's hard to tell at this distance. There's
a lot of the tree line at the edge of it that are

876
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:10,668
blocking the shape.

877
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:12,516
TALIESIN: Vex, what did it look like?

878
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:13,763
LAURA: What did what look like?

879
00:58:13,763 --> 00:58:15,685
TALIESIN: The area where they are.

880
00:58:15,685 --> 00:58:21,906
LAURA: It was a camp with bones all over the
ground and floating music things. Dancing.

881
00:58:21,906 --> 00:58:25,102
TALIESIN: Were there tents?

882
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,843
LAURA: There weren't tents?

883
00:58:26,843 --> 00:58:28,166
MATT: No.

884
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:29,040
TALIESIN: Just dirt?

885
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,168
LAURA: Just bones.

886
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:31,387
TALIESIN: Was there a fire pit?

887
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:38,496
LAURA: Yes? Was there a fire pit? There was a
single fire pit. There was a floating violin and a

888
00:58:38,496 --> 00:58:40,687
floating set of drums.

889
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:46,326
TALIESIN: Single fire pit, lit. Set of drums.
Violin.

890
00:58:46,326 --> 00:58:53,125
TRAVIS: Hey, I've got an idea. How about you race
in, grab Scanlan, I'll kill the other two--

891
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:58,802
LAURA: No! Don't! They actually looked really
distraught. I think they were under a spell, as well.

892
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,410
TRAVIS: Have you no mercy?

893
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:06,843
TALIESIN: If we can save one, we can everybody,
possibly. I haven't seen it yet. I'm going

894
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:09,241
to try and get a little closer to it, gently.

895
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:17,433
LAURA: I'm going to nock an arrow. And point it
towards the violin and hold it there.

896
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:24,810
MATT: Okay. Percy, you creep closer. As you get
closer, the music gets louder.

897
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,991
LAURA: But you have stuff in your ears.

898
00:59:26,991 --> 00:59:28,523
TALIESIN: I have packed my ears.

899
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:33,482
MATT: You have, and as you approach, it doesn't
seem to have an effect on the volume of the

900
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,643
music.

901
00:59:34,643 --> 00:59:36,013
TALIESIN: I'm backing up.

902
00:59:36,013 --> 00:59:47,997
MATT: All right. Make an intelligence check. Add
your intelligence modifier.

903
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:51,540
LAURA: Please roll good.

904
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,095
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

905
00:59:53,095 --> 00:59:58,765
MATT: You begin to notice the increasing volume
despite the blockage in the ear pretty early on

906
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:00,848
and stop your advancement before you get too
close.

907
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:04,573
TALIESIN: I sit. I pull out Bad News and I start
to get a good look.

908
01:00:04,573 --> 01:00:06,107
SAM: Oh god, you're going to kill me?!

909
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:09,589
TALIESIN: No, I'm just going to cripple you. Calm
down.

910
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:11,398
LAURA: I feel like we should aim for the
instruments.

911
01:00:11,398 --> 01:00:14,435
TALIESIN: The instruments are noncorporeal, I
believe.

912
01:00:14,435 --> 01:00:15,565
LAURA: Are they?

913
01:00:15,565 --> 01:00:17,732
MATT: They're just elevated. You didn't get a good
look at them.

914
01:00:17,732 --> 01:00:21,569
TALIESIN: One way to find out. I'm going to take a
shot at the violin.

915
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:23,347
MATT: Roll an attack.

916
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:31,479
TALIESIN: I haven't done this in so long. 17 to
hit.

917
01:00:31,479 --> 01:00:34,738
MATT: 17 to hit. That hits. Roll damage.

918
01:00:34,738 --> 01:00:36,205
LAURA: What did you aim at?

919
01:00:36,205 --> 01:00:37,406
TALIESIN: The violin.

920
01:00:37,406 --> 01:00:38,900
LAURA: Can I aim at one of the other ones?

921
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,339
MATT: Yeah, you want to fire at the same time?

922
01:00:40,339 --> 01:00:41,720
LAURA: Yeah, since he shot, I want to shoot.

923
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,376
MATT: Which one are you shooting at, the drums?

924
01:00:43,376 --> 01:00:45,057
LAURA: What else was there?

925
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:47,521
MATT: There was the drums, the flute, and the
violin.

926
01:00:47,521 --> 01:00:48,500
LAURA: Drums.

927
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,883
MATT: Roll an attack for the drums.

928
01:00:49,883 --> 01:00:52,145
LIAM: The woods are full of Irishmen.

929
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:55,497
TALIESIN: 12 points of damage.

930
01:00:55,497 --> 01:00:58,408
MARISHA: Oh shit, Flogging Molly's playing the
Feywild, yo!

931
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:00,625
LAURA: I rolled 16.

932
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,028
MATT: 16 hits, so damage?

933
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:03,017
TALIESIN: 12.

934
01:01:03,017 --> 01:01:04,351
MATT: 12. And roll damage.

935
01:01:04,351 --> 01:01:08,050
LAURA: 15.

936
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:11,256
MATT: 15, okay. Scanlan, I need you to roll a
wisdom saving throw.

937
01:01:11,256 --> 01:01:18,365
SAM: Saving throw? Not at disadvantage? Natural
20.

938
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:22,385
MATT: You guys with your natural 20s! Okay. Roll
it again.

939
01:01:22,385 --> 01:01:26,203
SAM: Natural 20.

940
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:28,580
TRAVIS: Back-to-back?!

941
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,651
LAURA: What the what?!

942
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:35,554
MATT: That's absurd. You've been storing this shit
after a week we've been gone.

943
01:01:35,554 --> 01:01:37,410
MARISHA: I don't think that's happened since we
played at home.

944
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:40,909
LAURA: No, it happened when I was saving him
against the Briarwoods. Two natural 20s.

945
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:42,162
MARISHA: That's right!

946
01:01:42,162 --> 01:01:45,057
LIAM: That was 35 episodes ago.

947
01:01:45,057 --> 01:01:46,602
SAM: Wow!

948
01:01:46,602 --> 01:02:01,402
MATT: All right. You take 24 points of psychic
damage, Scanlan. As both of you guys fire, both of

949
01:02:01,402 --> 01:02:05,406
the instruments scatter for a second, and there is
an echo of psychic energy that resonates

950
01:02:05,406 --> 01:02:11,758
throughout the entirety of that grove. The fire
shakes and dissipates, almost going out. Scanlan,

951
01:02:11,758 --> 01:02:18,291
you can see reach up and grab the sides of his
head in pain. The guard and the wolf that were

952
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:26,184
dancing do the same, except they both collapse
immediately on the ground. A moment passes, the

953
01:02:26,184 --> 01:02:31,472
instruments reform, the music continues, and
Scanlan goes right back into the dance.

954
01:02:31,472 --> 01:02:35,331
SAM: I throw my white man's overbite back on.

955
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:36,946
LAURA: Maybe it's time for Grog to go in.

956
01:02:36,946 --> 01:02:40,378
TALIESIN: No. Round two.

957
01:02:40,378 --> 01:02:44,484
LAURA: Round two, Grog runs in and grabs Scanlan,
and we run out. He can't be charmed!

958
01:02:44,484 --> 01:02:50,662
TRAVIS: Before you let me off the chain. There are
trees, right? Who's benefitting from this charm?

959
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:53,589
TALIESIN: The instruments and the campsite.

960
01:02:53,589 --> 01:02:55,558
TRAVIS: There's not somebody in a tree, hiding
out?

961
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:59,944
TALIESIN: I think the campsite just might be a
campsite. I want to try and douse the fire.

962
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:05,094
MARISHA: If you want to rage and go in, I can be
there on standby.

963
01:03:05,094 --> 01:03:06,944
TRAVIS: You're going to let me go?

964
01:03:06,944 --> 01:03:09,053
LAURA: I feel like we should let Grog go.

965
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:18,590
MARISHA: I use Alter Self to shape my fist into a
giant rock fist and I deck Grog to throw him into

966
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:19,966
a rage.

967
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:24,771
MATT: The jaw is momentarily displaced as you pop
it back into place.

968
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:28,122
MARISHA: Grog, go get our bard!

969
01:03:28,122 --> 01:03:31,231
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

970
01:03:31,231 --> 01:03:38,559
MATT: You take one damage from the punch impact,
and you go into a rage. Running forward at your 50

971
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,154
feet, you make it into the center of the camp.
Currently, the music is all around you, but you

972
01:03:42,154 --> 01:03:46,824
don't hear it because all you see is red and
Scanlan's fucking horrible white man's overbite

973
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,668
dancing by himself at the campsite with no
allies.

974
01:03:49,668 --> 01:03:55,369
TRAVIS: I don't know if I've killed an elf in
quite a while, so I'm going to aim my axe at the

975
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:57,578
throat of the elf that's dancing.

976
01:03:57,578 --> 01:04:00,849
MATT: The elf isn't dancing; both he and the
werewolf are on the ground, unmoving.

977
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:02,296
TRAVIS: They didn't get back up?

978
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,985
MATT: No, they're fucking down.

979
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:06,160
SAM: It's just me and some instruments now. You
have to come get me.

980
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,894
TRAVIS: Sweet, I'm just grabbing Scanlan and
running straight through.

981
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:11,907
MATT: I need you guys to make opposed athletics
checks. No, this would be strength.

982
01:04:11,907 --> 01:04:15,428
SAM: Strength or athletics?

983
01:04:15,428 --> 01:04:18,972
MATT: For this one, I initially said athletics;
that's fine. They're almost equatable.

984
01:04:18,972 --> 01:04:22,759
SAM: Saving or check?

985
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:24,257
MATT: Check.

986
01:04:24,257 --> 01:04:27,085
SAM: Ten.

987
01:04:27,085 --> 01:04:28,269
TRAVIS: 25.

988
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:37,025
MATT: 25. You grab Scanlan. You begin to make your
way out of the camp. It was 40 or 50 feet to get

989
01:04:37,025 --> 01:04:38,136
in and grab him.

990
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:39,811
TALIESIN: Is he starting to make his way out of
the camp?

991
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:42,677
MATT: He's grabbed Scanlan and pulled Scanlan off
his feet.

992
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:46,275
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot him in the shoulder
with my Retort gun.

993
01:04:46,275 --> 01:04:48,198
MATT: Okay. Roll an attack.

994
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:50,149
MARISHA: Keep the rage going? Nice.

995
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:52,777
TALIESIN: Ooh, just barely. 16.

996
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:57,052
MATT: Total of 16? What's your armor class, Grog?

997
01:04:57,052 --> 01:04:58,239
TRAVIS: 20.

998
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:03,024
TALIESIN: Taking another shot. Rolling like shit.
That's better. 20.

999
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,943
MATT: What's your armor class?

1000
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:05,824
TRAVIS: 20.

1001
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:06,987
MATT: Roll damage.

1002
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:14,769
TALIESIN: Thank god. It's been so long! Where are
all my dice? Just a nick. 16 points of damage.

1003
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:20,249
MATT: You take 16 points of piercing damage,
halved, so you take eight. You feel the music

1004
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:24,457
begin to creep into your ears as the blood pumping
in your skull begins to subside, and then

1005
01:05:24,457 --> 01:05:29,703
(gunshot) your shoulder gets blown back. You look
over and you can see the bullet wound and the

1006
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:34,021
blood beginning to pour out of the small piercing
wound you've suffered in your shoulder. The red

1007
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:35,688
takes over once again.

1008
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:37,015
TRAVIS: Vax!

1009
01:05:37,015 --> 01:05:40,004
(laughter)

1010
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:47,029
MATT: Clutching Scanlan at your side, you go
running out of the field. Because this is the

1011
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:51,809
secondary round now, make one more athletics check
versus his athletics check.

1012
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:59,686
TRAVIS: 22.

1013
01:05:59,686 --> 01:06:06,483
MATT: Yeah. Scanlan's pushing away as hard as he
can against your body, but you have him footballed

1014
01:06:06,483 --> 01:06:11,848
under your arm and go charging out of the center
there. As you pull out of the center of the camp,

1015
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:18,662
the flame's reclaimed its general spiraling
height. The music keeps playing, and then as you

1016
01:06:18,662 --> 01:06:23,618
guys rejoin the rest of the party, the music
begins to fade as the instruments slowly drift

1017
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:28,487
down and lay still.

1018
01:06:28,487 --> 01:06:30,204
LAURA: Good, it stopped. We can go back out.

1019
01:06:30,204 --> 01:06:33,658
TALIESIN: (cackles) Really?

1020
01:06:33,658 --> 01:06:35,670
SAM: Am I okay?

1021
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:39,902
MATT: You're all right now. Your brain comes to
you. Your legs are a little sore, and you were

1022
01:06:39,902 --> 01:06:41,546
already exhausted to begin with.

1023
01:06:41,546 --> 01:06:47,090
SAM: I instinctually start freaking Grog. Dry hump
dancing.

1024
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:48,567
TRAVIS: Like a little dog on my calf?

1025
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:50,235
LAURA: Okay, so you're all right, Scanlan?

1026
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:55,328
SAM: Oh, what? I was dancing. It was amazing.
There were lights.

1027
01:06:55,328 --> 01:07:01,458
LAURA: I release my brother. He's out of Raven's
Slumber.

1028
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:03,097
LIAM: Did we see a play yet?

1029
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:05,885
LAURA: It was the worst play I've ever seen.

1030
01:07:05,885 --> 01:07:07,460
TALIESIN: It's more of an intermission.

1031
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,412
LAURA: Garmelie! Why didn't you warn us that could
happen?

1032
01:07:10,412 --> 01:07:16,510
MATT: Garmelie, who's there by the side, comes out
of his invisibility, and says, "I tried! I really

1033
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:20,839
"tried! But you guys continually insist to go
face-first in whatever I warn you about, because

1034
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:23,617
"you don't trust me, apparently, when you hired me
to be your guide!"

1035
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:25,201
LAURA: We trust you, dear.

1036
01:07:25,201 --> 01:07:28,758
MATT: "Hopefully you've learned a lesson! God."
(sighs)

1037
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:33,251
SAM: Wow. That was amazing.

1038
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:37,900
TRAVIS: So the fire's out; instruments are gone.
Should we loot the campfire?

1039
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,339
LAURA: We should not go back out there.

1040
01:07:40,339 --> 01:07:42,987
SAM: Can we get those weapons, somehow?

1041
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:44,820
MARISHA: Which weapons?

1042
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,914
SAM: The musical weapons.

1043
01:07:46,914 --> 01:07:50,288
MARISHA: You want the magical enchanted
instruments?

1044
01:07:50,288 --> 01:07:52,914
SAM: I guess we can't get them, can we?

1045
01:07:52,914 --> 01:07:55,074
LAURA: Best to avoid them.

1046
01:07:55,074 --> 01:07:59,335
TALIESIN: It's a trap. It's not actually musical
instruments.

1047
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:00,506
SAM: We'll flip a coin, right, Grog?

1048
01:08:00,506 --> 01:08:02,488
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it. Roll a d20.

1049
01:08:02,488 --> 01:08:08,029
SAM: Disadvantage. One.

1050
01:08:08,029 --> 01:08:10,971
LAURA: Let's avoid it.

1051
01:08:10,971 --> 01:08:12,515
MARISHA: We're good.

1052
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:13,813
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

1053
01:08:13,813 --> 01:08:15,444
LAURA: We move towards the dusk.

1054
01:08:15,444 --> 01:08:17,350
TRAVIS: We're moving towards the Gilded Run.

1055
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:25,114
MATT: All right. As you guys begin moving away,
Garmelie scoots up a little bit and gets a look in

1056
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:28,948
the edge, and goes, "Well, you certainly found the
happy campsite, so good job."

1057
01:08:28,948 --> 01:08:31,091
TRAVIS: Oh, you told us about that earlier.

1058
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:32,714
MATT: "Yes! Yes, I did."

1059
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:36,316
MARISHA: Oh, that's the happy campsite.

1060
01:08:36,316 --> 01:08:38,405
TALIESIN: Have you not figured that out yet?

1061
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:44,159
MARISHA: I thought he was being metaphorical. I
didn't know it was literal.

1062
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,405
MATT: (sighs)

1063
01:08:47,405 --> 01:08:49,945
TALIESIN: This is quite literally the land of
literalism at this point.

1064
01:08:49,945 --> 01:08:51,795
TRAVIS: We make people sigh a lot.

1065
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:59,829
MATT: All right. I need you to roll a survival
check with advantage, leading the group forward.

1066
01:08:59,829 --> 01:09:05,675
LAURA: 25.

1067
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:12,962
MATT: 25. All right. You guys continue pushing
duskward. Between you and Garmelie leading the

1068
01:09:12,962 --> 01:09:18,198
way, the forest gets ever thicker. The trees get
even closer together, and you feel that some areas

1069
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:22,788
have no more than maybe three or four feet between
the tree trunks themselves. The rest is really

1070
01:09:22,788 --> 01:09:31,569
angry, tangled roots, as well as the high-growing
underbrush of the entire forest. Moon still

1071
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:33,206
unmoving in the sky.

1072
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:35,207
TRAVIS: Are we trampling anything as we're
walking?

1073
01:09:35,207 --> 01:09:36,997
MARISHA: Yeah, we're not stepping on mandrakes,
right?

1074
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:41,262
MATT: No. In fact, it's her high rolls that are
keeping you guys from stepping into any of the

1075
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:45,698
local dangerous possibly screaming fauna.

1076
01:09:45,698 --> 01:09:48,611
SAM: Matt, did my Countercharm help at all?

1077
01:09:48,611 --> 01:09:49,924
MATT: It did.

1078
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,235
LAURA: It gave us advantage--

1079
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:52,474
SAM: But did you need it?

1080
01:09:52,474 --> 01:09:53,611
LAURA: No, I did, yeah.

1081
01:09:53,611 --> 01:09:54,890
SAM: Hey, I did it right!

1082
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,526
LIAM: Half-elves have advantage on charm.

1083
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:00,098
LAURA: Oh.

1084
01:10:00,098 --> 01:10:01,213
SAM: It didn't help?

1085
01:10:01,213 --> 01:10:02,316
LAURA: It didn't help.

1086
01:10:02,316 --> 01:10:07,636
MATT: With anybody else, though, it would've
helped. It actually helped you.

1087
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,571
SAM: I still was charmed.

1088
01:10:09,571 --> 01:10:10,996
MATT: You still were charmed.

1089
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:15,075
LIAM: Is the footing here precarious? I know she's
leading us through, but is it all viney and

1090
01:10:15,075 --> 01:10:16,119
shitty?

1091
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:22,576
MATT: It's not great. It would slow your pace if
you didn't have her leading you through. It's

1092
01:10:22,576 --> 01:10:26,274
still not the fastest pace in the world, but
you're able to keep going at a decent rate.

1093
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:34,146
TRAVIS: Can I jog up to Garmelie and Vex real
fast? You said that there were lycans at some

1094
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,503
point, and you said they move through the trees,
right?

1095
01:10:37,503 --> 01:10:41,200
MATT: "Yes, from what I've heard."

1096
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,949
TRAVIS: Would that be these trees?

1097
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:45,558
MATT: "Possibly."

1098
01:10:45,558 --> 01:10:49,367
TRAVIS: Right. Have you seen a lycan?

1099
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:51,143
MATT: "I haven't."

1100
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:54,287
TRAVIS: Great. We should be keeping an eye on the
trees.

1101
01:10:54,287 --> 01:10:55,700
LAURA: I was trying to.

1102
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,298
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

1103
01:10:57,298 --> 01:11:06,568
LAURA: 36.

1104
01:11:06,568 --> 01:11:16,036
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you glance up, right into two yellowish eyes that

1105
01:11:16,036 --> 01:11:24,001
are piercing from just past the leaf line of the
canopy above you. As soon as you look up and see

1106
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:28,088
them, they immediately disappear in the darkness,
and you hear a low growl and some shifting in the

1107
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:29,655
leaves above you.

1108
01:11:29,655 --> 01:11:32,041
LAURA: I think they're here.

1109
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:39,062
MATT: At this point, you guys begin to hear,
surrounding you in the distance, growling, sounds

1110
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:46,333
of shifting and movement in the trees just beyond.
You hear in the distance one singular (howl) and

1111
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:55,235
barks echoing around you in the center of the
forest. Shadows begin to dart between the trees,

1112
01:11:55,235 --> 01:12:02,369
and a quiet moan of wind begins to break what was
once silence in this forest. As you guys glance

1113
01:12:02,369 --> 01:12:07,415
around you in the darkness, many of you having
darkvision; even this low moonlight, Percy, you

1114
01:12:07,415 --> 01:12:11,853
can still make out the shapes that are shifting.
You look in your vicinity at what appear to be

1115
01:12:11,853 --> 01:12:18,372
about six different medium to larger sized
man-like humanoid creatures that step out of the

1116
01:12:18,372 --> 01:12:25,749
trees, revealing themselves, most of which contain
a wolf-like appearance, elongated snout, darker

1117
01:12:25,749 --> 01:12:31,695
gray and brown furs, large pointy ears and
gleaming angry eyes, the lips curled back

1118
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:38,553
revealing white teeth. You see one large
tiger-like man, which sends you immediately into a

1119
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:44,499
recoiling moment, though larger than the rakshasa
that you've experienced, and not with the

1120
01:12:44,499 --> 01:12:52,469
signature back hands. They are unclothed, and you
see barreling behind you guys, heavy footfalls as

1121
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:57,931
you see what looks to be a giant, bipedal bear
clutching a greataxe comes (smash) through one of

1122
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:05,919
the tree clearings and (roars). They're not
attacking. They're not advancing. They've just

1123
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:07,322
surrounded you.

1124
01:13:07,322 --> 01:13:09,598
SAM: That's not good.

1125
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:12,378
TRAVIS: Well, they're here.

1126
01:13:12,378 --> 01:13:15,946
LIAM: I give Scanlan a little boot in the butt
forward a couple of steps.

1127
01:13:15,946 --> 01:13:24,821
SAM: Hello. We come in peace. We mean you no harm.
If we've tread into your territory, we will exit

1128
01:13:24,821 --> 01:13:28,716
immediately, and we apologize for offending you or
your gods.

1129
01:13:28,716 --> 01:13:35,219
MATT: Some of the wolf-men creatures look at each
other. The tiger individual steps further out of

1130
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:41,793
the shadows and appears to have two iron-like
bracers on, a longbow strapped across his back,

1131
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:49,878
and steps forward to meet you from beyond the tree
that he was partially obscured from. "Intruders.

1132
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:56,395
"Your terrible fate brings you within our domain.
For what purpose?"

1133
01:13:56,395 --> 01:14:05,826
SAM: We seek passage through this marshland to
what lies beyond it. We are searching for--

1134
01:14:05,826 --> 01:14:08,179
MARISHA: The Shademirk bog.

1135
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:10,573
SAM: The Shademirk bog.

1136
01:14:10,573 --> 01:14:21,315
LAURA: We hope to rid the land of a cancerous tree
that has been a blight for a very long time.

1137
01:14:21,315 --> 01:14:24,509
MATT: "I know not of this tree."

1138
01:14:24,509 --> 01:14:30,428
SAM: It's a source of great evil that's been
corrupting this plane and ours.

1139
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:34,966
MATT: "There are many evils that corrupt this
plane, small tasty thing."

1140
01:14:34,966 --> 01:14:36,808
SAM: I'm not tasty.

1141
01:14:36,808 --> 01:14:40,978
LAURA: He's not. Many diseases.

1142
01:14:40,978 --> 01:14:43,789
TALIESIN: Dozens.

1143
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:49,657
MATT: The tiger looks about at the other
werewolves who are now stepping in, and the bear,

1144
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:57,024
who's put the greataxe over its back now at this
point, begins to step closer in. The tiger, whose

1145
01:14:57,024 --> 01:15:02,283
eyes are now bent on you, takes another step
forward, "So."

1146
01:15:02,283 --> 01:15:04,810
(buzzing)

1147
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:15,722
MATT: The audio on my iPad needs some help,
apparently. Time to get new music. Oh, that's an

1148
01:15:15,722 --> 01:15:18,289
expenditure I don't need.

1149
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:20,800
SAM: A new iPad for no reason?

1150
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,441
LAURA: Something else? It's our computer?

1151
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:26,891
CREW: We're going to switch out the one that we
usually use.

1152
01:15:26,891 --> 01:15:30,770
SAM: This is so exciting.

1153
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:33,581
MATT: Isn't it, though? Especially at that
climactic moment, my audio goes down.

1154
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:34,653
CREW: Sorry!

1155
01:15:34,653 --> 01:15:35,963
MATT: It's all good.

1156
01:15:35,963 --> 01:15:38,653
LAURA: We should probably kill it. I feel bad for
everybody listening.

1157
01:15:38,653 --> 01:15:44,907
MATT: I'm going to kill the music, then. Okay.
Bringing us back in now. Sorry about that.

1158
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:50,087
LAURA: Maybe just make it come out of your iPad.

1159
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:56,142
MATT: It's something. Sure, we'll go with that.

1160
01:15:56,142 --> 01:15:57,389
LIAM: Works for us.

1161
01:15:57,389 --> 01:15:58,708
LAURA: That's how we did it at home, man!

1162
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,894
TALIESIN: This is the best simulation of our old
home game that I've had.

1163
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:14,449
MATT: That's enough to give you the feel. The
tiger takes that step forward, leans in to you,

1164
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:28,394
and goes, "To parley or continue our hunt?" Looks
at the other wolves. "Call Ukurat." And roars out

1165
01:16:28,394 --> 01:16:34,752
to the air. The other wolves all together begin to
howl in unison. (howls) Loudly into the sky.

1166
01:16:34,752 --> 01:16:39,114
(howls)

1167
01:16:39,114 --> 01:16:41,337
LAURA: What's Trinket doing?

1168
01:16:41,337 --> 01:16:45,204
MATT: Trinket's backed up with you guys, growling
and facing off with the bear-like entity that's

1169
01:16:45,204 --> 01:16:51,084
keeping eyes on Trinket but is still (growling) up
into the air of the forest.

1170
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:54,498
TRAVIS: Shit.

1171
01:16:54,498 --> 01:17:00,627
LAURA: Oh. Ukurat. Isn't that the big ghost bear?

1172
01:17:00,627 --> 01:17:04,834
MARISHA: No, that was Oralan. Ukurat's the lycan
leader.

1173
01:17:04,834 --> 01:17:12,404
MATT: A few moments pass as the howling subsides
and they all stare intently, keeping a bestial

1174
01:17:12,404 --> 01:17:22,798
cage around you in the center of this forest. It's
at that point you begin to hear (footfalls) what

1175
01:17:22,798 --> 01:17:31,062
sounds like a series of heavy footfalls at a
speed, and the sound of trees thrashed as various

1176
01:17:31,062 --> 01:17:37,651
hanging vines and branches are snapped or passed
at such a speed. There is a mass of black shadow

1177
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:42,622
that comes emerging from the brush, slamming into
the side of one of the trees near you with a

1178
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:47,839
clattering (crash). You see it pressed up against
the side before leaping off, rebounding, landing

1179
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:58,042
right beside you guys, separating your group,
giving Scanlan, Vex, Trinket, and Garmelie pushed

1180
01:17:58,042 --> 01:18:00,424
to one side and the rest of you to the other.

1181
01:18:00,424 --> 01:18:06,449
You now see this giant, feral beast, humanoid in
shape once it begins to stand, but larger than

1182
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:16,168
anything you've seen before, as the large wolf-man
creature stands at full height, about 12, 13 feet

1183
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:23,671
tall, its shoulders wider than yours, Grog. A
series of various jeweled necklaces adorn its

1184
01:18:23,671 --> 01:18:30,787
throat, and you can see what appears to be a
makeshift leather belt and armored leg piece that

1185
01:18:30,787 --> 01:18:36,386
sit upon it. Rings glimmer around its fingers, and
you can see a series of scars drawn across one

1186
01:18:36,386 --> 01:18:42,014
side of its cheek that go down to its throat. It
looks about at the rest of you, separated,

1187
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:52,170
glancing at each side. "So. You seek passage,
yes?"

1188
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:54,592
SAM: Yes, that's right.

1189
01:18:54,592 --> 01:19:07,523
MATT: "There is a toll to pay. A favor to the
Fendir is granted. A favor in kind."

1190
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:11,743
SAM: A favor to you?

1191
01:19:11,743 --> 01:19:15,000
MARISHA: The Fendir, is that what you said?

1192
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,896
MATT: "We are the Fendir."

1193
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:30,290
SAM: Well, we would be happy to help if we can. We
are here to do good, anyway. We've already done

1194
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:38,515
some. We conquered the devastating campsite of
Soradun the Happy, and we're up to doing more

1195
01:19:38,515 --> 01:19:41,168
tasks like that, if it would help.

1196
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:47,020
MATT: The wolf creature that you expect, at this
point, is the Lord Ukurat that you heard mentioned

1197
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:53,052
before by both Garmelie and the wolf and beast
kin, leans down towards you, making you

1198
01:19:53,052 --> 01:19:58,496
uncomfortable, as his head is larger than your
entire body, Scanlan. The lips curl back, and you

1199
01:19:58,496 --> 01:20:04,400
can see the glistening white teeth, and drool
slowly dripping off the edge of its curled

1200
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:21,655
purple-black lips. (sniffs) "We will not eat this
day if you agree to do us this favor."

1201
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,519
LAURA: Name it.

1202
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:38,419
MATT: "The pixie Wishers carry a madness, one that
pits them against all who wander these woods. They

1203
01:20:38,419 --> 01:20:51,832
"prey upon us Fendir, take our forms to desecrate
their twisted garden and decorate their lives. We

1204
01:20:51,832 --> 01:21:11,114
"lose family. We, the Fendir, and I, lord of this
brood, ask you to take into this home, find these

1205
01:21:11,114 --> 01:21:24,202
"Wishers, destroy a relic of their people. In
particular, a circle of crystal stones they keep.

1206
01:21:24,202 --> 01:21:40,196
"It sits among their homes, tended by their mystic,
Iotha. She wields the power to subjugate us all.

1207
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:50,714
"Do you agree to these terms, or does our hunt
continue?"

1208
01:21:50,714 --> 01:21:57,408
LAURA: They sound really powerful, these pixies.

1209
01:21:57,408 --> 01:22:04,093
SAM: If you are not powerful enough to conquer
them, how would we have a chance?

1210
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:12,071
MATT: "If you do not think you have a chance,
perhaps you're best suited as our meal for the night."

1211
01:22:12,071 --> 01:22:19,027
LAURA: No, we have a very good chance of defeating
them. We are quite powerful. Just wondering why

1212
01:22:19,027 --> 01:22:21,298
you haven't done it before.

1213
01:22:21,298 --> 01:22:31,907
MATT: "We have fallen to their magic. We are not
tested and tempered against such trickster cunning

1214
01:22:31,907 --> 01:22:45,180
"creatures. But if you speak like you've passed the
campsite unscathed, perhaps you have skills we lack."

1215
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:55,411
SAM: That is true. We probably do. We made quick
work of the camp. It was a proud moment for us,

1216
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:58,287
one that will be storied for generations.

1217
01:22:58,287 --> 01:23:07,901
MARISHA: This mystic-- Iotha, you said-- she has
the power to subjugate your kind?

1218
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:10,163
MATT: "Yes."

1219
01:23:10,163 --> 01:23:12,976
MARISHA: Does she have the power to create more
lycans?

1220
01:23:12,976 --> 01:23:18,788
MATT: "She sees our kind to be exterminated."

1221
01:23:18,788 --> 01:23:24,176
SAM: Where can we find this site?

1222
01:23:24,176 --> 01:23:26,364
MATT: "Follow the lights."

1223
01:23:26,364 --> 01:23:27,808
SAM: The lights?

1224
01:23:27,808 --> 01:23:38,611
MATT: The small, glittering fey lights that you've
seen throughout many of the darker forested areas

1225
01:23:38,611 --> 01:23:45,060
of the Feywild since you arrived, now taking a
look, they all slowly, gently drift in a singular

1226
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:49,376
direction before touching the ground and
dissipating. Even though the wind that blew

1227
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:54,733
through with their arrival has faded, they all
still drift in a direction as if they're being

1228
01:23:54,733 --> 01:23:56,873
called a specific way.

1229
01:23:56,873 --> 01:24:11,270
LAURA: Cool. Hey, question. Should we help you
with this terrible problem you've been facing, do

1230
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:19,507
you think there's any way you would want to help
us when we try to take out this cancerous tree? It

1231
01:24:19,507 --> 01:24:23,181
needs to be taken care of. Teamwork?

1232
01:24:23,181 --> 01:24:27,222
MATT: "Cancerous tree?"

1233
01:24:27,222 --> 01:24:35,415
LAURA: It's really bad. Whole other area for you
to dominate. It's quite wonderful.

1234
01:24:35,415 --> 01:24:37,609
MARISHA: The Shademirk bog.

1235
01:24:37,609 --> 01:24:39,690
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1236
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:51,903
LAURA: Goddamn it! Wait, it's my favored terrain.

1237
01:24:51,903 --> 01:24:55,389
MATT: Doesn't work for every single thing you do.
The forest isn't going to help you with your

1238
01:24:55,389 --> 01:24:58,090
persuasion check, sorry.

1239
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,619
LAURA: Natural one.

1240
01:24:59,619 --> 01:25:05,211
MATT: The wolf leans forward, and the mouth comes
right up to you for a second. The nose almost

1241
01:25:05,211 --> 01:25:14,823
nudges you, and you instinctually stand back as it
(snorts). "This is not part of our parley. We

1242
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:27,724
"grant you passage and to take what you wish off
their pixie corpses. That is the deal. Take it, or

1243
01:25:27,724 --> 01:25:29,957
"we hunt."

1244
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:38,254
SAM: I think we'll take the deal. Happy to enter
into this contract with you. No problem.

1245
01:25:38,254 --> 01:25:40,979
MARISHA: We're just stacking contracts.

1246
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:46,122
SAM: Is there a timetable to this? Do we have to
do this now? Can we do this on the way out of the

1247
01:25:46,122 --> 01:25:47,489
Feywild?

1248
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:55,328
MATT: "There is no <i>out</i> until this agreement is
completed."

1249
01:25:55,328 --> 01:26:00,625
SAM: Do we have your word that we have completely
safe passage? We don't have to worry about any

1250
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:04,197
other sort of monsters getting us in our sleep on
the way there?

1251
01:26:04,197 --> 01:26:19,354
MATT: "They and us rule this brush. Against each
other, nothing will take your path away. We can

1252
01:26:19,354 --> 01:26:21,383
"guide you if need be."

1253
01:26:21,383 --> 01:26:30,725
MARISHA: If we take out the pixies, what is the
future of your tribe?

1254
01:26:30,725 --> 01:26:43,621
MATT: "The brush will be ours. We will no longer
be taken, our people left there to wither and

1255
01:26:43,621 --> 01:26:45,803
"waste away to the elements."

1256
01:26:45,803 --> 01:26:54,131
MARISHA: Just a question. Do you guys hunt the
pixies? Because I'm getting the sense that this is

1257
01:26:54,131 --> 01:27:03,905
a weird turf war, and I just want to know the full
story before we enter into this contract.

1258
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:08,361
MATT: The bear, who's closer to you, takes a step
forward, and you feel the ground shake behind you.

1259
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:10,164
TRAVIS: I match his step.

1260
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:15,528
MATT: Match his step, okay. Grog steps forward.
The other of the wolves nearby see you, and they

1261
01:27:15,528 --> 01:27:22,167
all (snarl) crouch down, snarling in your
direction. Lord Ukurat puts his hands out. "Calm,

1262
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:33,775
"my brethren. We wish to live in peace amongst the
woods, away from those who would hunt us, outside

1263
01:27:33,775 --> 01:27:35,407
"and in."

1264
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:41,321
MARISHA: Why don't you guys just agree? You guys
take this half of the forest, and they'll take the

1265
01:27:41,321 --> 01:27:55,953
other? I can even help you guys build a big wall,
if you want, not to get oddly political. Maybe

1266
01:27:55,953 --> 01:27:59,446
death is not the answer here?

1267
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:04,808
MATT: One of the wolves nearby speaks up, "She
speaks like she knows this place." And you hear

1268
01:28:04,808 --> 01:28:11,374
some laughter. The wolf's head, which is turned to
you, Lord Ukurat turns to you.

1269
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:12,951
MARISHA: They think I'm funny.

1270
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:16,303
SAM: How many total are there?

1271
01:28:16,303 --> 01:28:20,515
MATT: There were seven, including the 12-foot-tall
one.

1272
01:28:20,515 --> 01:28:24,687
SAM: We can probably take them.

1273
01:28:24,687 --> 01:28:41,702
MARISHA: I'm not trying to take sides here. Just
from a third party looking in. Trying to

1274
01:28:41,702 --> 01:28:44,347
understand both perspectives, maybe.

1275
01:28:44,347 --> 01:28:47,498
MATT: "You have only heard one perspective."

1276
01:28:47,498 --> 01:28:48,771
MARISHA: Exactly!

1277
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:55,875
MATT: "Then go speak with them, if you'd like.
Learn what we have learned. Perhaps that will help

1278
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:57,339
"guide your choice."

1279
01:28:57,339 --> 01:28:58,631
MARISHA: Not a bad idea.

1280
01:28:58,631 --> 01:28:59,855
TALIESIN: I find that very reasonable.

1281
01:28:59,855 --> 01:29:02,247
LAURA: That is very agreeable.

1282
01:29:02,247 --> 01:29:09,932
MATT: "We will be watching." At this point, Lord
Ukurat crouches down, leaps up into the canopy of

1283
01:29:09,932 --> 01:29:19,503
the forest, and you hear (impacts) as he leaps off
in the distance. The other wolves (howl) follow

1284
01:29:19,503 --> 01:29:26,420
suit and dart off in separate directions, and you
hear as the bear backs away, Trinket growls back

1285
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:27,637
at him.

1286
01:29:27,637 --> 01:29:29,538
LAURA: Be nice to him, Trinket!

1287
01:29:29,538 --> 01:29:42,141
MATT: (bear growl) The bear goes, (grunt). Trinket
goes (grunt). Broseph bear snarls. You guys are

1288
01:29:42,141 --> 01:29:44,086
left to the quiet of the forest now.

1289
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:50,359
SAM: We could probably kill them all. I'm just
throwing that out there.

1290
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:52,197
TRAVIS: I'm super restless.

1291
01:29:52,197 --> 01:29:57,668
LIAM: I don't really want to fight a group of
werebeasts, but we have much better chances, if

1292
01:29:57,668 --> 01:30:05,561
we're going to pick a side, against them with
their brute strength, than against fucking pixies.

1293
01:30:05,561 --> 01:30:07,545
I am charmed at the drop of a hat!

1294
01:30:07,594 --> 01:30:15,295
TRAVIS: Have you fought a werewolf before? Have
you fought a lycan? Is it just brute strength?

1295
01:30:15,295 --> 01:30:25,394
LIAM: Well, they are cursed. They seem very
unhappy. They have to sit in rolling chairs at all times.

1296
01:30:25,394 --> 01:30:31,744
TALIESIN: We literally have no idea what we're up
against in any direction.

1297
01:30:31,744 --> 01:30:34,190
LIAM: There are scary fairy stories, though,
growing up?

1298
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:39,630
MATT: You've heard about people that transform, but
any specifics about their capabilities--

1299
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:46,296
MARISHA: I have a few spells that are good against
people who can transform, but we're also in the

1300
01:30:46,296 --> 01:30:48,755
Feywild, so I don't know.

1301
01:30:48,755 --> 01:30:51,698
TALIESIN: Cute and dainty also means scary and
dangerous.

1302
01:30:51,698 --> 01:30:56,402
LIAM: We really bollocksed up the musical
instruments scenario, and I don't feel like the

1303
01:30:56,402 --> 01:30:59,922
pixies are going to be much better than that.

1304
01:30:59,922 --> 01:31:02,054
TALIESIN: I feel like that went rather well.

1305
01:31:02,054 --> 01:31:03,889
LAURA: All things considered.

1306
01:31:03,889 --> 01:31:06,756
TALIESIN: Took less than three tries to figure
that out.

1307
01:31:06,756 --> 01:31:10,632
LIAM: Yeah, we ran in for 30 seconds, shit the
bed, and then got the hell out. We didn't try to

1308
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,863
end them. We didn't finish anything.

1309
01:31:12,863 --> 01:31:17,982
TRAVIS: It also bears remarking that Garmelie said
we're not supposed to side with either, right?

1310
01:31:17,982 --> 01:31:19,219
LAURA: Right, Garmelie?

1311
01:31:19,219 --> 01:31:26,298
MATT: "It's really up to you guys. I don't know if
you have much of a choice right now."

1312
01:31:26,298 --> 01:31:29,782
LIAM: Can't we just thread the needle and play
them both?

1313
01:31:29,782 --> 01:31:37,436
MARISHA: Until we get out of here. We're talking
about exterminating the group of fairies--

1314
01:31:37,436 --> 01:31:41,225
TRAVIS: No, we're destroying one of their relics.

1315
01:31:41,225 --> 01:31:43,350
TALIESIN: Just have to desecrate a relic.

1316
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:48,152
MARISHA: You don't think they're going to put up a
massive fight if we go in and start kicking their relics?

1317
01:31:48,152 --> 01:31:50,429
TALIESIN: I feel like we've desecrated relics
before.

1318
01:31:50,429 --> 01:31:55,575
LAURA: Scanlan is really charming.

1319
01:31:55,575 --> 01:31:58,601
SAM: I could probably convince them to destroy it
themselves.

1320
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:00,525
TALIESIN: How's that book going?

1321
01:32:00,525 --> 01:32:09,299
MARISHA: You genuinely think we can destroy the
relics without harming anyone?

1322
01:32:09,299 --> 01:32:11,434
LAURA: No, but I'd like to try.

1323
01:32:11,434 --> 01:32:14,226
TALIESIN: But I also will admit, I kind of want to
see the pixies.

1324
01:32:14,226 --> 01:32:16,202
MARISHA: I want to see the pixies, too.

1325
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:20,457
LIAM: You also wanted to hear the music. That
didn't go well. We've got a bow to get you.

1326
01:32:20,457 --> 01:32:26,773
TRAVIS: Let's just go over there, do a little
recon, and then we'll make up our minds.

1327
01:32:26,773 --> 01:32:28,578
LIAM: We are idiots.

1328
01:32:28,578 --> 01:32:29,751
TALIESIN: Yes, we are.

1329
01:32:29,751 --> 01:32:37,211
SAM: I'm more inclined to turn around and fight
these lions and tigers and bears, oh my! Because

1330
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:38,325
pixies, who knows?

1331
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:42,392
LAURA: Honestly, they didn't seem that bad. I feel
terrible killing them for no reason.

1332
01:32:42,392 --> 01:32:45,330
MARISHA: Maybe we can talk to the pixies about--

1333
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:49,515
TALIESIN: I think you would look fetching in a new
lined winter jacket.

1334
01:32:49,515 --> 01:32:51,606
MARISHA: Maybe they can work with us.

1335
01:32:51,606 --> 01:32:56,003
SAM: I'm okay with at least going to do some
recon.

1336
01:32:56,003 --> 01:33:04,108
TRAVIS: Go see the pixies. We send in Garmelie. If
he dies, then we make a choice. Do you have a

1337
01:33:04,108 --> 01:33:05,631
revision to that plan?

1338
01:33:05,631 --> 01:33:08,973
MATT: "I would think that would be the last
portion of the plan. Everything else goes forward,

1339
01:33:08,973 --> 01:33:13,009
"and then, all else fails, perhaps Garmelie would
have a hard time."

1340
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:15,924
MARISHA: Garmelie. Go, Percy.

1341
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:20,411
TALIESIN: You're our guide. Guide us. We're
supposed to go where we're going, so you're

1342
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:22,412
supposed to get us there. How do we get there?

1343
01:33:22,412 --> 01:33:23,809
LAURA: Follow the lights.

1344
01:33:23,809 --> 01:33:26,051
MATT: "You know exactly how to go there. Follow
the lights."

1345
01:33:26,051 --> 01:33:27,590
TRAVIS: Wow, you're so brave.

1346
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:29,922
MARISHA: We brought you here.

1347
01:33:29,922 --> 01:33:33,857
TALIESIN: Garmelie, I'm so curious as to what
happens if you're going to renege on our

1348
01:33:33,857 --> 01:33:35,132
contract.

1349
01:33:35,132 --> 01:33:39,052
LAURA: Would you want to draw some of the pixies
if we see them?

1350
01:33:39,052 --> 01:33:41,373
MATT: "If they let me."

1351
01:33:41,373 --> 01:33:45,291
LAURA: You can hide behind Grog, and you draw the
pixies.

1352
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:47,682
MATT: "I can maybe do that."

1353
01:33:47,682 --> 01:33:51,502
TRAVIS: They're going to be pixies with giant
dickbutts everywhere.

1354
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:57,507
MARISHA: Garmelie, is there anything in particular
about pixies we desperately need to be aware of?

1355
01:33:57,507 --> 01:34:02,954
MATT: "They're tiny. They're frail, mostly
mischievous."

1356
01:34:02,954 --> 01:34:04,973
TRAVIS: How tiny?

1357
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:08,720
MATT: He makes a motion with his hands about like
that.

1358
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,603
LAURA: They're really that small? Are they super
strong?

1359
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:12,793
MATT: "No, they're quite the opposite, actually."

1360
01:34:12,793 --> 01:34:14,789
SAM: But there are lots of them, and they're fast
and invisible.

1361
01:34:14,789 --> 01:34:21,046
MATT: "They are fairly magical entities. Depending
on which type of pixie they are, their

1362
01:34:21,046 --> 01:34:29,251
"dispositions can shift dramatically. The Feywild
entities that live and exist in certain areas tend

1363
01:34:29,251 --> 01:34:40,470
"to adapt to those areas. There are creatures of
all emotional and moral backgrounds and interests.

1364
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:42,257
"It's hard to say."

1365
01:34:42,257 --> 01:34:46,559
TALIESIN: I'll also say, if we are going to attack
the were-creatures, it would be nice to have a

1366
01:34:46,559 --> 01:34:48,461
little help, maybe.

1367
01:34:48,461 --> 01:34:49,832
SAM: Help? From whom?

1368
01:34:49,832 --> 01:34:56,477
TALIESIN: From the pixies. If we explain our
situation, we can make a decision and either help

1369
01:34:56,477 --> 01:34:58,507
the were-creatures or--

1370
01:34:58,507 --> 01:35:02,875
LAURA: Maybe the pixies can help us take out the
cancerous tree and all the things around it.

1371
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:05,664
TRAVIS: Well, let's go get eyes on them, shall
we?

1372
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:07,282
MARISHA: Let's go.

1373
01:35:07,282 --> 01:35:12,322
MATT: All right, make a survival check. With
advantage because you're in a forest.

1374
01:35:12,322 --> 01:35:13,561
LAURA: I'm in a forest.

1375
01:35:13,561 --> 01:35:14,718
SAM: Oh, just her?

1376
01:35:14,718 --> 01:35:16,244
MATT: Just her, yeah.

1377
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:20,124
LAURA: That's better. 22.

1378
01:35:20,124 --> 01:35:27,068
MATT: 22. You guys begin to move slowly forward as
you ascertain a direction from the occasional

1379
01:35:27,068 --> 01:35:34,540
small flutter of fey light that drifts at a slight
curvature in its descent, making your way in the

1380
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:41,420
direction where, supposedly, the nexus of this
pixie tribe should exist.

1381
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:46,560
We're going to go ahead and take a break. We will see
you guys back here in a few minutes to pick up

1382
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:52,361
where we left off, wandering towards the pixie
home. We'll see you guys in a minute.

1383
01:35:52,361 --> 01:53:10,673
[break]

1384
01:53:10,673 --> 01:53:18,813
MATT: Welcome back. As we come into the event, Vox
Machina is slowly crawling through the Moonbrush

1385
01:53:18,813 --> 01:53:27,716
towards wherever these gentle fey lights drift,
leading them, hopefully, to some sort of home

1386
01:53:27,716 --> 01:53:38,207
space or residence of the local Wishers pixie
population. You guys, pushing on for about another

1387
01:53:38,207 --> 01:53:42,139
two and half, three hours, following the lights.

1388
01:53:42,139 --> 01:53:43,807
SAM: Reading.

1389
01:53:43,807 --> 01:53:46,674
LAURA: How many hours do you have left of
reading?

1390
01:53:46,674 --> 01:53:49,882
SAM: After two and half more, I have about four
and a half.

1391
01:53:49,882 --> 01:53:58,905
MATT: So close. You're on the cusp of your week
end, too. You guys make your way-- hoping that the

1392
01:53:58,905 --> 01:54:06,187
music now is fixed. We shall see. It's a cable
issue, not an iPad issue, it looks like. As you

1393
01:54:06,187 --> 01:54:12,912
guys push on, you eventually see a cluster of
small glowing lights in the distance, Vex.

1394
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:22,781
Garmelie immediately goes, "I'm going to
hide now," and he goes invisible.

1395
01:54:22,781 --> 01:54:25,045
LAURA: Garmelie, won't they see you?

1396
01:54:25,045 --> 01:54:28,896
MATT: "That's possible. Should I just stay back?"

1397
01:54:28,896 --> 01:54:35,088
LAURA: You should probably just hold onto Grog. If
he runs in, just trail behind him.

1398
01:54:35,088 --> 01:54:39,387
MATT: "Okay," and you feel the little hand grab
the back of your belt again, a similar situation.

1399
01:54:39,387 --> 01:54:41,309
You hear (groans).

1400
01:54:41,309 --> 01:54:52,262
You guys now see what appears to be a thicket in
the center of this portion of the forest. Maybe 20

1401
01:54:52,262 --> 01:54:58,872
or so natural-looking homes forming a small
glowing community, almost like they were grown out

1402
01:54:58,872 --> 01:55:04,260
of the ground of the local trees. The bark itself
protrudes from the side of a tree and creates a

1403
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:09,286
dome-like abode that has carved little windows in
it and a glowing interior. It's a very pretty

1404
01:55:09,343 --> 01:55:15,855
fairy community out there, right in there in the
center. All of the fey lights in the forest are

1405
01:55:15,855 --> 01:55:24,686
slowly drifting in towards the center of this
community. At a hundred-foot distance, you can

1406
01:55:24,686 --> 01:55:27,106
just make out the faintest details.

1407
01:55:27,106 --> 01:55:29,083
LAURA: They're teeny, though? It's teeny little
houses?

1408
01:55:29,083 --> 01:55:30,497
MATT: Yes.

1409
01:55:30,497 --> 01:55:34,142
SAM: Like doghouse size?

1410
01:55:34,142 --> 01:55:37,940
MATT: Each home or abode is about the size of a
basketball.

1411
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:40,456
SAM: Are they made out of toadstools?

1412
01:55:40,456 --> 01:55:44,340
MATT: It's hard to see from this distance. You can
just see the general size of the homes.

1413
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,610
MARISHA: This is so cute.

1414
01:55:46,610 --> 01:55:48,656
LIAM: And Vex is the only one that can see it.

1415
01:55:48,656 --> 01:55:50,795
MATT: She's the furthest ahead, yes.

1416
01:55:50,795 --> 01:55:54,178
TRAVIS: I feel like "cute" is the last word we
should use for this.

1417
01:55:54,178 --> 01:55:55,939
TALIESIN: It will be the last word you ever say.

1418
01:55:55,939 --> 01:56:00,721
LAURA: Definitely pixie city is up ahead.

1419
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:03,365
TRAVIS: Should we look for perimeter alarms or
traps?

1420
01:56:03,365 --> 01:56:08,264
LAURA: Yes, I look for that. Good idea, Grog! Good
thinking.

1421
01:56:08,264 --> 01:56:16,170
LIAM: I'm going to go stealth, just because.

1422
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:17,345
LAURA: Me, too.

1423
01:56:17,345 --> 01:56:18,882
MATT: All right. Make a stealth check, guys.

1424
01:56:18,882 --> 01:56:20,680
TRAVIS: All right, Pass Without a Trace?

1425
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:22,670
LAURA: That's not still active anymore?

1426
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:28,251
TRAVIS: That was awful.

1427
01:56:28,251 --> 01:56:30,597
SAM: We're doing stealth checks?

1428
01:56:30,597 --> 01:56:32,857
MATT: Of those who wish to move forward towards
the village.

1429
01:56:32,857 --> 01:56:34,585
MARISHA: Oh, all of us? Sure.

1430
01:56:34,585 --> 01:56:37,862
TRAVIS: 15.

1431
01:56:37,862 --> 01:56:39,323
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1432
01:56:39,323 --> 01:56:40,350
TRAVIS: What!

1433
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:41,283
LIAM: 25.

1434
01:56:41,283 --> 01:56:42,417
SAM: Are we adding plus ten?

1435
01:56:42,417 --> 01:56:43,802
LAURA: 27.

1436
01:56:43,802 --> 01:56:45,012
SAM: Five.

1437
01:56:45,012 --> 01:56:46,018
MARISHA: 17.

1438
01:56:46,018 --> 01:56:56,535
MATT: And as you guys creep forward, still humming
the essence of the tune you guys managed to escape

1439
01:56:56,535 --> 01:57:05,168
earlier, Scanlan's enjoying the echoes of his
countercharm that he so well presented earlier,

1440
01:57:05,168 --> 01:57:12,394
you shush him as you slowly creep closer to the
outskirts of this pixie community. As you get

1441
01:57:12,394 --> 01:57:20,244
closer-- when you envision a city, or a cluster of
abodes like this, it's a large section, but for

1442
01:57:20,244 --> 01:57:25,710
the scale of this it's no more than maybe 25 feet
across and there are maybe two dozen homes

1443
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:34,713
throughout the entirety of this space. You can see
just on the edge, looking inside, what appears to

1444
01:57:34,713 --> 01:57:43,086
be a circle of about ten slightly glowing
quartz-like stones, arranged in a perfect circle

1445
01:57:43,086 --> 01:57:49,976
in the center of the community, and most of the
fey lights are drawn towards it and cluster and

1446
01:57:49,976 --> 01:57:53,066
rest at the base of the stones before fading
away.

1447
01:57:53,066 --> 01:58:04,689
You can also see, throughout this community,
arranged like decorative statues, three stone,

1448
01:58:04,689 --> 01:58:14,772
human-sized wolf-men type creatures that are
locked in place, their claws up like this. Some

1449
01:58:14,772 --> 01:58:20,862
look like they're fleeing, over a shoulder.
They're all locked in a stone position and

1450
01:58:20,862 --> 01:58:27,853
currently now have draped over them small vines
and flowers, and they now rest amongst the

1451
01:58:27,853 --> 01:58:31,142
community as some sort of a landmark.

1452
01:58:31,142 --> 01:58:33,454
LIAM: All right, that is kind of fucked up.

1453
01:58:33,454 --> 01:58:35,600
SAM: Yeah.

1454
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:41,905
MATT: You can see at this distance now a few
moving, slightly brighter points of glowing light

1455
01:58:41,905 --> 01:58:50,396
fluttering by and going from one little home to
another. One over and into the circle flutters

1456
01:58:50,396 --> 01:58:55,708
back. You guys are still at a good 40, 50 feet
from the outside of this clearing.

1457
01:58:55,708 --> 01:58:59,322
LAURA: And we can't spot any pixies near us at
all?

1458
01:58:59,322 --> 01:59:00,838
MATT: Not directly near you, no.

1459
01:59:00,838 --> 01:59:02,763
TRAVIS: I hate spiders.

1460
01:59:02,763 --> 01:59:12,151
SAM: I don't want to go near this place. We should
either talk to them, or run away right now.

1461
01:59:12,151 --> 01:59:14,387
TRAVIS: I like the latter of those two.

1462
01:59:14,387 --> 01:59:17,057
LIAM: What was the goal here? To grab part of the
circle?

1463
01:59:17,057 --> 01:59:19,239
SAM: To break a piece of the circle.

1464
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:22,012
MARISHA: To kick over their rocks.

1465
01:59:22,012 --> 01:59:27,804
TRAVIS: Did they say to bring one back? Or to
break it? The relic.

1466
01:59:27,804 --> 01:59:29,524
MATT: They said desecrate.

1467
01:59:29,524 --> 01:59:32,303
MARISHA: They said it was the source of their
power, right?

1468
01:59:32,303 --> 01:59:34,757
LIAM: Desecrate it?

1469
01:59:34,757 --> 01:59:40,341
TRAVIS: You ever stepped on an anthill, right? It
gets real nasty, real fast.

1470
01:59:40,341 --> 01:59:43,357
LIAM: Is it an open area over the village?

1471
01:59:43,357 --> 01:59:52,310
MATT: It is a clearing of trees about 25, 30 feet
across, and along the interior of the trees are

1472
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:57,780
where a lot of the homes are grown out of, or out
of the ground almost like strange tree trunk roots

1473
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:03,781
up into a dome-like natural home, and even they're
arranged in a smaller circle around the

1474
02:00:03,781 --> 02:00:08,276
central stone circle that is the middle.

1475
02:00:08,276 --> 02:00:10,087
TRAVIS: Like forest wasps.

1476
02:00:10,087 --> 02:00:15,986
LIAM: It all depends on the definition of
desecrate. I could fly you 500 feet in the air,

1477
02:00:15,986 --> 02:00:22,469
and you could shit upon that circle. It just
depends if that is desecration in the eyes of the fey.

1478
02:00:22,469 --> 02:00:29,984
TALIESIN: I will say that from what I gather of
this realm, it probably isn't enough.

1479
02:00:29,984 --> 02:00:33,413
TRAVIS: What if we asteroid-dropped Keyleth from
500 feet?

1480
02:00:33,413 --> 02:00:35,256
MARISHA: That was very fun.

1481
02:00:35,256 --> 02:00:37,805
LAURA: That would take out the lot of them?

1482
02:00:37,805 --> 02:00:39,630
MARISHA: But it would take out the lot of them,
right?

1483
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:42,405
LAURA: It seems so drastic.

1484
02:00:42,405 --> 02:00:47,863
LIAM: The fairies or the fairy circle? Wouldn't it
just destroy the circle?

1485
02:00:47,863 --> 02:00:50,717
MARISHA: How wide is the entire--

1486
02:00:50,717 --> 02:01:00,775
MATT: About 25, 30 feet for the entirety of the
community. The circle itself is five to ten feet

1487
02:01:00,775 --> 02:01:03,048
wide. It's not a very large circle at all.

1488
02:01:03,048 --> 02:01:06,318
TRAVIS: You'd be in your stone elemental form,
it'd be no problem for you.

1489
02:01:06,318 --> 02:01:08,469
MARISHA: It'd be no problem for me.

1490
02:01:08,469 --> 02:01:12,929
SAM: I don't think she would ever get close to it.
They have some sort of shield up.

1491
02:01:12,929 --> 02:01:15,886
TALIESIN: It'd be kicking the hornet's nest,
certainly.

1492
02:01:15,886 --> 02:01:19,617
SAM: Tell me this, Vex, Vax. People with high
perception.

1493
02:01:19,617 --> 02:01:22,688
LAURA: He's Vex, I'm Vax.

1494
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:27,638
SAM: Where are the animal men? Are they watching
us right now?

1495
02:01:27,638 --> 02:01:30,356
MATT: Perception check.

1496
02:01:30,356 --> 02:01:46,775
LAURA: That's double because of favored terrain.
What is that, 20? No, 33.

1497
02:01:46,775 --> 02:01:53,499
MATT: 33. Doing a pretty intense scan of the
vicinity of the forest around you, you see no sign

1498
02:01:53,499 --> 02:01:57,483
of any of the previous pack that you encountered.

1499
02:01:57,483 --> 02:02:01,657
SAM: I think they're out there somewhere.

1500
02:02:01,657 --> 02:02:05,740
TALIESIN: I think they're probably hanging back a
bit. I don't know if they'd want to get this close.

1501
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:08,462
MARISHA: I'm sure they have other means of spying
on us.

1502
02:02:08,462 --> 02:02:13,087
TRAVIS: I vote we don't fuck with the pixies.
Never thought I'd say that.

1503
02:02:13,087 --> 02:02:22,951
MARISHA: Here's what I have at my disposal. A, I can
shapeshift into a little tiny spider and go in there--

1504
02:02:22,951 --> 02:02:27,073
LAURA: Can you shapeshift into a pixie?

1505
02:02:27,073 --> 02:02:30,907
MARISHA: No, unfortunately. Beasts. Particular.

1506
02:02:30,907 --> 02:02:33,791
SAM: Can't you go underground and pop up?

1507
02:02:33,791 --> 02:02:40,462
MARISHA: Yeah. Once again, probably destroying
their entire village, but yeah.

1508
02:02:40,462 --> 02:02:43,500
TALIESIN: The two of us could snipe something out.

1509
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:52,469
MARISHA: But I could go in like a spider and be a
spider. I also happened to bring Hallucinatory

1510
02:02:52,469 --> 02:03:03,532
Terrain today, so depending on how smart we think
the lycans are, maybe I can make it look like we

1511
02:03:03,532 --> 02:03:04,850
destroyed it.

1512
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:06,435
LIAM: How long does that last?

1513
02:03:06,435 --> 02:03:11,376
MARISHA: 24 hours. Let me double check before I
make promises.

1514
02:03:11,376 --> 02:03:12,689
LAURA: I like this.

1515
02:03:12,689 --> 02:03:15,886
LIAM: Just to give us a day's head start.

1516
02:03:15,886 --> 02:03:23,353
SAM: What we could do, Grog and I could run back,
I could cut him over the eye, and say: It was

1517
02:03:23,353 --> 02:03:26,932
horrible. It was quite a fight, but we won.

1518
02:03:26,932 --> 02:03:31,504
LAURA: Do we need to let the pixies know that
we're going to do this?

1519
02:03:31,504 --> 02:03:38,154
MARISHA: Maybe Scanlan, do you have something that
could-- I don't want to waste a spell and then

1520
02:03:38,154 --> 02:03:44,506
find out that they have some sort of magical
barrier enchantment that it can't stay up there.

1521
02:03:44,506 --> 02:03:47,135
TRAVIS: What, you'd waste Hallucinatory Terrain?

1522
02:03:47,135 --> 02:03:48,464
MARISHA: Yeah.

1523
02:03:48,464 --> 02:03:50,010
TRAVIS: When else are you going to use that?

1524
02:03:50,010 --> 02:03:52,588
MARISHA: Well, I'm burning a spell slot.

1525
02:03:52,588 --> 02:03:59,369
SAM: If they block it with their magical little
crystals all over the place, then they'll also

1526
02:03:59,369 --> 02:04:01,068
know we're here and they will attack us.

1527
02:04:01,068 --> 02:04:09,569
MARISHA: Yes, 24 hours for a 150-foot cube, I make
a terrain look, sound, and smell like some sort of

1528
02:04:09,569 --> 02:04:12,136
other terrain.

1529
02:04:12,136 --> 02:04:15,371
LAURA: I'm just worried that if you do it then the
lycans are going to bust it, and then they just go

1530
02:04:15,371 --> 02:04:17,533
to battle amongst themselves.

1531
02:04:17,533 --> 02:04:18,888
TALIESIN: Isn't that brilliant?

1532
02:04:18,888 --> 02:04:20,321
LAURA: This is actually really smart.

1533
02:04:20,321 --> 02:04:25,314
SAM: Wait, can you still tree-bamf us out of
harm's way if we needed to?

1534
02:04:25,314 --> 02:04:27,774
LAURA: You've got the mansion.

1535
02:04:27,774 --> 02:04:29,521
SAM: I don't have the mansion.

1536
02:04:29,521 --> 02:04:31,831
TALIESIN: He's already burned the mansion.

1537
02:04:31,831 --> 02:04:33,500
SAM: I haven't slept in days.

1538
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:40,672
MARISHA: The only thing I have that can get us out
fast is Plane Shift, which will get us out of the

1539
02:04:40,672 --> 02:04:45,304
Feywild, but I brought that just in case.

1540
02:04:45,304 --> 02:04:50,923
TRAVIS: Third option, we say fuck the lycans, fuck
the pixies, and we just keep going.

1541
02:04:50,923 --> 02:04:55,508
LAURA: What if you do the Hallucinatory Terrain,
and we just leave?

1542
02:04:55,508 --> 02:04:59,291
MARISHA: Yeah, we could do the Hallucinatory
Terrain, and if it fails, then I guess we won't be

1543
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:00,635
in any worse situation.

1544
02:05:00,635 --> 02:05:02,671
TALIESIN: I'm a big fan of Hallucinatory Terrain.

1545
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:07,185
SAM: If we do Hallucinatory Terrain and it fails,
the pixies will straight-up attack us.

1546
02:05:07,185 --> 02:05:08,651
LAURA: How do you know?

1547
02:05:08,651 --> 02:05:11,058
MARISHA: Well, it won't hurt them. It just makes
it look different.

1548
02:05:11,058 --> 02:05:13,194
SAM: Everything here has attacked us.

1549
02:05:13,194 --> 02:05:18,586
TRAVIS: All in favor of Hallucinatory Terrain,
raise your hand.

1550
02:05:18,586 --> 02:05:25,814
SAM: We have to get the animal men here to see it,
or else it isn't worth it.

1551
02:05:25,814 --> 02:05:29,021
LAURA: We cast it and we create a ruckus--

1552
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:35,078
SAM: I will buy into this idea if we have a plan
for when the pixies are about to literally attack

1553
02:05:35,078 --> 02:05:36,730
us five minutes from now.

1554
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:41,839
MARISHA: Well, we can do Hallucinatory Terrain,
and if we run into the lycans, all we have to do

1555
02:05:41,839 --> 02:05:43,489
is say we did it.

1556
02:05:43,489 --> 02:05:50,773
LAURA: Do Hallucinatory Terrain. Garmelie, which
direction should we run if we're running towards

1557
02:05:50,773 --> 02:05:52,258
where we're supposed to be going?

1558
02:05:52,258 --> 02:06:01,148
MATT: Garmelie has watched this thing with eyes
wide, and he's like, "That way."

1559
02:06:01,148 --> 02:06:02,337
LAURA: All right.

1560
02:06:02,337 --> 02:06:04,730
TRAVIS: Weren't you dropping little green rocks?

1561
02:06:04,730 --> 02:06:07,192
MARISHA: I was dropping little green rocks.

1562
02:06:07,192 --> 02:06:09,100
TRAVIS: So we can find our way back to the lycans,
right?

1563
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:10,627
MARISHA: Yeah.

1564
02:06:10,627 --> 02:06:14,080
TALIESIN: That's of course assuming that the
little green rocks work here.

1565
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,314
MARISHA: They were red. They were red rocks.

1566
02:06:16,314 --> 02:06:19,944
TALIESIN: There's an awful lot of reasons why the
little red rocks wouldn't work.

1567
02:06:19,944 --> 02:06:22,034
TRAVIS: Okay. Let's do it.

1568
02:06:22,034 --> 02:06:23,722
LAURA: We take off running--

1569
02:06:23,722 --> 02:06:25,621
SAM: Wait, where are we running?

1570
02:06:25,621 --> 02:06:27,249
LAURA: Towards the bog.

1571
02:06:27,249 --> 02:06:28,705
SAM: Towards the what?

1572
02:06:28,705 --> 02:06:30,125
LIAM: We think towards the bog.

1573
02:06:30,125 --> 02:06:32,957
SAM: We're leaving Kiki and just running?

1574
02:06:32,957 --> 02:06:39,201
MARISHA: No, I can do this at a range of 300 feet,
so let's back up 300 feet.

1575
02:06:39,201 --> 02:06:43,531
LAURA: You do it, we act like we did something, we
start running.

1576
02:06:43,531 --> 02:06:49,249
MARISHA: Hallucinatory Terrain, are we doing this?
Are we ready? Are we doing this? I did it, bamf.

1577
02:06:49,249 --> 02:06:56,862
MATT: So you stand back a bit at the outskirts.
What kind of hallucinatory terrain are you

1578
02:06:56,862 --> 02:06:57,948
creating?

1579
02:06:57,948 --> 02:07:06,473
MARISHA: I want it to look like the fairy terrain,
but their little huts are on fire like they've

1580
02:07:06,473 --> 02:07:14,526
been raided, and I want the circle of rocks to be
obliterated, and all their statues to be knocked

1581
02:07:14,526 --> 02:07:23,933
over and it smells like fire and shit and pixie
blood. Like Grog said.

1582
02:07:23,933 --> 02:07:28,545
MATT: Grasping at what you imagine pixie blood
would smell like.

1583
02:07:28,545 --> 02:07:34,210
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm sure it smells delightful.
Herbal.

1584
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:40,751
MATT: So as Keyleth, you finish concentrating, you
guys watch as there's a shimmer of magical energy,

1585
02:07:40,751 --> 02:07:48,788
and now you see where once the beautiful glowing
fairy light of the pixie abodes now look burnt to

1586
02:07:48,788 --> 02:07:55,113
a cinder. You can see embers slowly rising off of
them as the stone structures are now broken across

1587
02:07:55,113 --> 02:07:56,487
the ground.

1588
02:07:56,487 --> 02:07:59,026
LIAM: The horror, the horror.

1589
02:07:59,026 --> 02:08:01,911
SAM: The pixies see it too, though.

1590
02:08:01,911 --> 02:08:05,320
MARISHA: They can see it, but they can also be
like: oh, this isn't real.

1591
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:10,648
LIAM: I grab Keyleth by the wrist and start
running away from the village.

1592
02:08:10,648 --> 02:08:12,938
TRAVIS: Are we running back to the lycans or to
the Shademirk?

1593
02:08:12,938 --> 02:08:14,567
LAURA: Towards the Shademirk.

1594
02:08:14,567 --> 02:08:17,283
TRAVIS: I've got Garmelie.

1595
02:08:17,283 --> 02:08:20,634
LIAM: Go, run faun, run.

1596
02:08:20,634 --> 02:08:22,940
LAURA: But keep on the lookout for mandrakes.

1597
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:24,799
MARISHA: And werewolves.

1598
02:08:24,799 --> 02:08:30,060
MATT: Okay, so I want everyone to make a
perception check.

1599
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:35,384
SAM: Strong eight.

1600
02:08:35,384 --> 02:08:37,909
TALIESIN: Natural one.

1601
02:08:37,909 --> 02:08:39,305
LIAM: Natural one.

1602
02:08:39,305 --> 02:08:42,272
TALIESIN: No!

1603
02:08:42,272 --> 02:08:44,490
MARISHA: 22.

1604
02:08:44,490 --> 02:08:47,530
LAURA: No! 31.

1605
02:08:47,530 --> 02:08:49,057
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

1606
02:08:49,057 --> 02:08:51,502
MATT: What are you looking out for? Which
direction are you looking?

1607
02:08:51,502 --> 02:08:54,133
LAURA: I'm looking towards where we're going.

1608
02:08:54,133 --> 02:08:57,448
MATT: Okay, so you're going with Garmelie, heading
in the direction duskward. Where are you looking,

1609
02:08:57,448 --> 02:08:58,599
Keyleth?

1610
02:08:58,599 --> 02:09:01,192
MARISHA: I'm looking out for werewolves, for
lycans.

1611
02:09:01,192 --> 02:09:03,321
MATT: Okay. Where are you looking?

1612
02:09:03,321 --> 02:09:06,937
TRAVIS: I'm looking for lycans, too. I'm just
being honest!

1613
02:09:06,937 --> 02:09:09,271
MATT: All right, so you guys continue pushing
forward--

1614
02:09:09,271 --> 02:09:11,400
LIAM: I'm shouting: The way is clear!

1615
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:26,587
MATT: All right, you guys run, and run, and run,
and you're pushing through brush and pushing over

1616
02:09:26,587 --> 02:09:37,740
elements and heavy hard portions of the floor. I
need everyone to roll-- this is going to be an

1617
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:41,433
athletics check for the keeping up the endurance
and the speed. This is not easy terrain you

1618
02:09:41,433 --> 02:09:43,020
continue to push through.

1619
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:44,209
MARISHA: Athletics?

1620
02:09:44,209 --> 02:09:47,448
LAURA: I've got land stride, so I don't get slowed
by any hard terrain.

1621
02:09:47,448 --> 02:09:49,163
MATT: You're fine. You don't need to roll.

1622
02:09:49,163 --> 02:09:50,498
TRAVIS: 24.

1623
02:09:50,498 --> 02:09:51,883
MARISHA: 24.

1624
02:09:51,883 --> 02:09:53,044
TALIESIN: 11.

1625
02:09:53,044 --> 02:09:58,872
SAM: I rolled twice, because of disadvantage. Both
were ones.

1626
02:09:58,872 --> 02:10:03,492
MATT: You've hit the spectrum today.

1627
02:10:03,492 --> 02:10:07,555
LIAM: Well, I rolled a one, but then I used Luck
and I rolled a 20.

1628
02:10:07,555 --> 02:10:15,638
MATT: You guys, calm down on the extremes! There
are other numbers between those two, you realize,

1629
02:10:15,638 --> 02:10:16,898
on the dice.

1630
02:10:16,898 --> 02:10:19,364
SAM: I'm tired from reading.

1631
02:10:19,364 --> 02:10:28,621
MATT: You're not reading during this run. But as
you guys are charging forward, Scanlan goes

1632
02:10:28,621 --> 02:10:36,040
face-first over a heavy root into the ground. You
guys have to double back, grab him, keep going.

1633
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:45,058
You push on, and you push on, and you push on for
what seems like another 30 minutes to an hour.

1634
02:10:45,058 --> 02:10:50,925
Your pace starts to slow due to general exhaustion
and you're unable to keep that speed and that

1635
02:10:50,925 --> 02:10:54,502
level of physical exertion for that long. Most of
you can't. Grog is happy to go forever.

1636
02:10:54,502 --> 02:10:57,484
Constitution of 20; he's good to go.

1637
02:10:57,484 --> 02:11:01,328
LIAM: He's basically good against anything except
one of the ancient dragons.

1638
02:11:01,328 --> 02:11:07,262
MATT: There's a few things he's not good against.
Tiny brain with arms and legs, not so good.

1639
02:11:07,262 --> 02:11:09,459
TRAVIS: Fuck that little bastard.

1640
02:11:09,459 --> 02:11:16,614
MATT: That was fun. Eventually, you begin to see a
thinning of the trees, like the forest is coming

1641
02:11:16,614 --> 02:11:22,832
to an end. You're beginning to hit the edge of the
duskward side of the Moonbrush.

1642
02:11:22,832 --> 02:11:24,930
LAURA: Are we going the right direction,
Garmelie?

1643
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:28,982
MATT: "As far as I know! Yes, we're going the
right way!"

1644
02:11:28,982 --> 02:11:31,509
MARISHA: You're taking us through the bog?

1645
02:11:31,509 --> 02:11:34,668
MATT: "Through the Moonbrush. That's what we're
going through."

1646
02:11:34,668 --> 02:11:36,030
MARISHA: Still to the bog.

1647
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:40,121
MATT: "Of course! Where else would I want to go?!"
He's holding his hat and rushing along.

1648
02:11:40,121 --> 02:11:41,818
LIAM: You want to go to the theater.

1649
02:11:41,818 --> 02:11:43,632
MATT: "No theater!"

1650
02:11:43,632 --> 02:11:46,843
LIAM: What's your problem with the arts, man?

1651
02:11:46,843 --> 02:11:56,504
MATT: You guys, at this point in time, come to the
final tree line, Vex and Vax and Garmelie helming

1652
02:11:56,504 --> 02:12:07,384
at the front of the pace before all three of you
slam into something extremely hard.

1653
02:12:07,384 --> 02:12:10,536
MARISHA: Oh fuck.

1654
02:12:10,536 --> 02:12:12,016
LAURA: What is it?

1655
02:12:12,016 --> 02:12:13,518
LIAM: Did it feel like a theater?

1656
02:12:13,518 --> 02:12:15,377
MATT: No, it felt like a wall.

1657
02:12:15,377 --> 02:12:16,976
LIAM: The wall of a theater?

1658
02:12:16,976 --> 02:12:19,471
LAURA: Seriously. A wall?

1659
02:12:19,471 --> 02:12:25,135
MATT: You stand back up and you guys catch up, and
same thing: you come up to the edge between where

1660
02:12:25,135 --> 02:12:33,034
the trees that hit the perimeter of the forest
are, and there's a barrier, an invisible barrier

1661
02:12:33,034 --> 02:12:36,418
right there that's preventing you from crossing.

1662
02:12:36,418 --> 02:12:38,864
LIAM: What is this thing, Garmelie?

1663
02:12:38,864 --> 02:12:40,639
MATT: "I don't know! I haven't encountered this."

1664
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:41,775
LIAM: Never ever?

1665
02:12:41,775 --> 02:12:44,015
MATT: "I don't walk into the middle of dangerous
forests for fun!"

1666
02:12:44,015 --> 02:12:49,176
TALIESIN: I don't think we can leave until we take
care of this.

1667
02:12:49,176 --> 02:12:52,818
TRAVIS: Wait. You can go invisible. Is it magic?
Can you tell?

1668
02:12:52,818 --> 02:12:56,044
MATT: "I can have a look at it."

1669
02:12:56,044 --> 02:12:57,940
TRAVIS: Yeah, have a look.

1670
02:12:57,940 --> 02:13:03,850
MATT: He comes up and looks over it for a bit. "To
be honest, this is a large-scale enchantment. This

1671
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:09,382
"is some sort of-- this is very powerful, very old
magic."

1672
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:11,311
MARISHA: Fucking old magic.

1673
02:13:11,311 --> 02:13:19,702
MATT: He turns around, looking at you guys. "Hi."

1674
02:13:19,702 --> 02:13:21,074
LAURA: Hi.

1675
02:13:21,074 --> 02:13:22,820
MATT: Looking past you.

1676
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:24,498
LAURA: Oh shit.

1677
02:13:24,498 --> 02:13:31,671
MATT: As you guys turn around and see behind you
what looks to be, shoulder to shoulder, a mass of

1678
02:13:31,671 --> 02:13:43,914
furred, standing, snarling, beast-like humanoids.
Behind them, landing and standing up to his full

1679
02:13:43,914 --> 02:13:49,164
height, his snout having to dip beneath the brush
under the nearest trees.

1680
02:13:49,164 --> 02:13:56,420
LIAM: See what we did to those pixies? Wrecked.

1681
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:58,368
LAURA: Fucking destroyed.

1682
02:13:58,368 --> 02:14:00,241
TRAVIS: Cut me real quick.

1683
02:14:00,241 --> 02:14:15,782
MATT: At this point, you now see as Lord Ukurat
steps from them, and they all begin to form a

1684
02:14:15,782 --> 02:14:22,864
semicircle around you. He goes, "Were you trying
to flee?"

1685
02:14:22,864 --> 02:14:25,915
TALIESIN: We were running from the pixies.

1686
02:14:25,915 --> 02:14:30,558
LAURA: We destroyed their home, and then we took
off running. That's what you wanted, right?

1687
02:14:30,558 --> 02:14:32,128
MARISHA: They're so scary.

1688
02:14:32,128 --> 02:14:38,694
MATT: "If you had done what we asked, you would
have been able to leave this forest."

1689
02:14:38,694 --> 02:14:41,456
TALIESIN: So we have to try harder. It didn't
work.

1690
02:14:41,456 --> 02:14:48,680
LAURA: Apparently, our methods were not complete.
We will go back and we will do it better this next time.

1691
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:52,466
MARISHA: To be fair, I don't remember entering a
formal contract.

1692
02:14:52,466 --> 02:14:58,282
LIAM: You took off before we shook hands or
anything.

1693
02:14:58,282 --> 02:15:07,915
MARISHA: You told us to go take a look at the
pixies first. And to get a second opinion. And we

1694
02:15:07,981 --> 02:15:14,144
have made it to the edge of the bog safely,
without your need of safe passage.

1695
02:15:14,144 --> 02:15:19,467
MATT: He's already turned around and walking away.
He says, "Do what you will. I have no interest in

1696
02:15:19,467 --> 02:15:30,461
"you. Liars, deceivers! You talk too much. Your
meat would taste like ash in my mouth. Well, good

1697
02:15:30,461 --> 02:15:40,951
"luck. Enjoy your time locked in this prison like
the rest of us!" The wolves turn around and walk away.

1698
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:45,228
LAURA: Wait, you're locked in here because of the
pixies?

1699
02:15:45,228 --> 02:15:47,033
TALIESIN: I feel like they're terrible
communicators.

1700
02:15:47,033 --> 02:15:51,645
MARISHA: Yeah, they should've told us that. I
don't think they wanted to tell us that.

1701
02:15:51,645 --> 02:15:56,923
LIAM: Would've been a good incentive for us to
destroy the pixies. We can't proceed without

1702
02:15:56,923 --> 02:15:58,407
destroying the pixies.

1703
02:15:58,407 --> 02:16:02,857
LAURA: A little communication is all we need!

1704
02:16:02,857 --> 02:16:08,161
TRAVIS: Can I take out my bloodaxe and go up to
the magic barrier and hit it as hard as I can?

1705
02:16:08,161 --> 02:16:09,967
MATT: Go for it. Roll an attack.

1706
02:16:09,967 --> 02:16:12,962
TALIESIN: This is going to be appalling. Don't.

1707
02:16:12,962 --> 02:16:14,830
TRAVIS: 22.

1708
02:16:14,830 --> 02:16:16,554
MATT: Okay, roll damage.

1709
02:16:16,554 --> 02:16:19,923
TRAVIS: How do I do that? I forget. I'm kidding.

1710
02:16:19,923 --> 02:16:22,912
MATT: It's been a few episodes.

1711
02:16:22,912 --> 02:16:26,259
TRAVIS: 16.

1712
02:16:26,259 --> 02:16:32,001
MATT: Okay. I need you to also make a wisdom
saving throw.

1713
02:16:32,001 --> 02:16:34,426
TRAVIS: Sweet. Natural one.

1714
02:16:34,426 --> 02:16:36,744
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1715
02:16:36,744 --> 02:16:43,463
LIAM: Got to love it when the crew laughs at your
final death crack.

1716
02:16:43,463 --> 02:16:48,022
MATT: As you pull back with the bloodaxe, you
slam with all your might into the barrier. As it

1717
02:16:48,022 --> 02:16:54,054
hits, there's a streak, a flash of vibrant,
bluish-white light and what sounds like the

1718
02:16:54,054 --> 02:17:00,576
highest shriek you've ever heard in the entirety
of your time on Exandria, at which point you watch

1719
02:17:00,576 --> 02:17:06,331
Grog get flung backwards at incredible speed
through the air, the actual blast sending you

1720
02:17:06,331 --> 02:17:11,662
almost into your allies and party, slamming into
one of the nearby tree trunks. The bloodaxe goes

1721
02:17:11,662 --> 02:17:17,199
plopping to the ground as you feel a number of
bones in your back crack from the impact. You

1722
02:17:17,199 --> 02:17:23,915
suffer 28 points of psychic damage and 14 points
of bludgeoning damage from hitting the tree.

1723
02:17:23,915 --> 02:17:28,880
TALIESIN: I feel like we all learned a very
valuable lesson right now.

1724
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,609
MARISHA: What's a good burrowing creature? A
badger?

1725
02:17:30,609 --> 02:17:32,348
TRAVIS: Ow.

1726
02:17:32,348 --> 02:17:36,295
LAURA: I feel like we need to rest, you guys. We
really need to rest.

1727
02:17:36,295 --> 02:17:40,048
TALIESIN: Let's sit down and camp, and in the
morning, we'll go and kill some pixies.

1728
02:17:40,048 --> 02:17:47,964
SAM: Wait. Are we trapped in here because we were
deceitful to these wolf-men, or because the pixies

1729
02:17:47,964 --> 02:17:49,804
are trapping everybody?

1730
02:17:49,804 --> 02:17:51,903
LIAM: The pixies are bitter little assholes.

1731
02:17:51,903 --> 02:17:57,313
MATT: Garmelie goes, "That doesn't make sense.
People enter and exit the forest without an issue."

1732
02:17:57,313 --> 02:17:58,908
SAM: We entered.

1733
02:17:58,908 --> 02:18:00,228
MARISHA: Yeah, we entered.

1734
02:18:00,228 --> 02:18:03,008
SAM: So why are we trapped here? Because we lied?

1735
02:18:03,008 --> 02:18:04,980
MATT: "I don't know."

1736
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:08,013
TRAVIS: I just don't think we can go this way.
(belches)

1737
02:18:08,013 --> 02:18:20,112
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to cast Minor
Illusion on the other side of the wall. Just an

1738
02:18:20,112 --> 02:18:21,711
image of myself.

1739
02:18:21,711 --> 02:18:27,795
MATT: Okay. As you attempt to cast the spell, the
arcane energy dissipates upon impact with the

1740
02:18:27,795 --> 02:18:29,458
barrier.

1741
02:18:29,458 --> 02:18:33,204
LAURA: Garmelie, who do you know that's left these
woods?

1742
02:18:33,204 --> 02:18:39,703
MATT: "That would be my uncle Jameson, who's the
person I learned most of this information about

1743
02:18:39,703 --> 02:18:41,241
"the Moonbrush from."

1744
02:18:41,241 --> 02:18:46,105
LAURA: Your uncle Jameson, and he was definitely
telling the truth that he went in the woods?

1745
02:18:46,105 --> 02:18:49,605
MATT: "He was probably a little intoxicated when
he was spinning these tales, but--"

1746
02:18:49,605 --> 02:18:53,341
TALIESIN: Is Jameson his real name or a nickname?

1747
02:18:53,341 --> 02:18:57,671
MATT: "As far as I know, it's his real name."

1748
02:18:57,671 --> 02:19:00,245
LAURA: So he knew about the happy camp.

1749
02:19:00,245 --> 02:19:02,411
MATT: "These were the things I was warned of,
yes."

1750
02:19:02,411 --> 02:19:09,580
LIAM: Do we want to waste any time trying to take
your broom up and see how high this barrier goes?

1751
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:12,189
MARISHA: I can dig and see if we can go under,
just in case.

1752
02:19:12,189 --> 02:19:15,678
TALIESIN: That doesn't jive.

1753
02:19:15,678 --> 02:19:19,131
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true. It didn't hurt us when we
just ran into it.

1754
02:19:19,131 --> 02:19:22,855
LIAM: No, when we ran into it, it felt like a
brick wall.

1755
02:19:22,855 --> 02:19:25,744
LAURA: I guess I fly up. Can I fly up and see how
high up it goes?

1756
02:19:25,744 --> 02:19:30,921
MATT: Sure. You get on the broom, you go past the
canopy and eventually, the front of the broom

1757
02:19:30,921 --> 02:19:35,662
clips and scrapes against, and you can see a
little bit of a shimmer of the barrier that domes up.

1758
02:19:35,662 --> 02:19:40,251
LAURA: It's a bubble. We're in a bubble. I go back
down.

1759
02:19:40,251 --> 02:19:41,985
TRAVIS: I have a proposal.

1760
02:19:41,985 --> 02:19:43,292
LAURA: Yes, Grog?

1761
02:19:43,292 --> 02:19:49,278
TRAVIS: Why don't we make our way back to the
pixie dome and say: oh, we were chased by these

1762
02:19:49,494 --> 02:19:54,856
horrible lycans! We wanted to kill them, but we
got stuck when we hit this invisible wall. Could

1763
02:19:54,856 --> 02:19:59,183
you do anything to help us get rid of the lycans?
And then we play both sides of the coin.

1764
02:19:59,183 --> 02:20:05,492
SAM: That is way better than our first idea, and
yet still terrible.

1765
02:20:05,492 --> 02:20:13,500
TALIESIN: I think we have to pick a terrible idea
and stick with it until it becomes far too much

1766
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:15,279
for us to deal with.

1767
02:20:15,279 --> 02:20:19,304
MARISHA: Can I take a look around and do a
perception check to see if anyone else might be

1768
02:20:19,304 --> 02:20:20,534
watching us?

1769
02:20:20,534 --> 02:20:22,670
MATT: Make a perception check.

1770
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:32,319
MARISHA: That's not bad. 25.

1771
02:20:32,319 --> 02:20:36,279
MATT: 25. You take a moment and glance about the
tree line, the floor.

1772
02:20:36,279 --> 02:20:40,990
MARISHA: Are there rustles in the bushes from
someone who might be invisible?

1773
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:49,066
MATT: No movement any further. Once the rest of
Lord Ukurat and his crew had vanished into the

1774
02:20:49,066 --> 02:20:56,152
nightward direction, you've seen no movement
since.

1775
02:20:56,152 --> 02:21:00,263
LAURA: I feel like they weren't that bad of guys.
They could've attacked us, and they didn't. They

1776
02:21:00,263 --> 02:21:01,374
just want out.

1777
02:21:01,374 --> 02:21:05,241
LIAM: They're certainly no meaner than Grog is.
They're just scarier.

1778
02:21:05,241 --> 02:21:10,469
TALIESIN: I propose we take a nap. Go back and
deal with the pixies one way or another.

1779
02:21:10,469 --> 02:21:18,620
LIAM: I agree with Percival. I think all our
options are shit. We pick the least shitty and see

1780
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:19,960
what happens.

1781
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:21,890
LAURA: Scanlan, can you sleep?

1782
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:24,722
SAM: If I read for a few more hours first, sure.

1783
02:21:24,722 --> 02:21:27,443
TALIESIN: You'll take first watch.

1784
02:21:27,443 --> 02:21:28,993
MARISHA: How long have we been up?

1785
02:21:28,993 --> 02:21:36,811
MATT: At this point in time, I'd say close to
eight, nine hours.

1786
02:21:36,811 --> 02:21:40,600
MARISHA: So it hasn't been a full day. Let's call
it an early night.

1787
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:44,417
LAURA: Read your book. We'll sleep.

1788
02:21:44,417 --> 02:21:48,119
TRAVIS: All right. You take first watch. We're
going to zonk out.

1789
02:21:48,119 --> 02:21:49,575
SAM: Okay.

1790
02:21:49,575 --> 02:21:51,061
LAURA: I'll stay up, as well.

1791
02:21:51,061 --> 02:21:52,700
MATT: So you're taking a short rest or a long
rest?

1792
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:56,623
LAURA: We'll take a short rest into a long rest.
So he can finish reading and then we can sleep.

1793
02:21:56,623 --> 02:22:00,140
MATT: All right, sure. So you're taking first
watch.

1794
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:02,687
LAURA: And I'm up with him.

1795
02:22:02,687 --> 02:22:03,907
MATT: Okay.

1796
02:22:03,907 --> 02:22:05,157
MARISHA: Can I...

1797
02:22:05,157 --> 02:22:06,446
MATT: Can you...?

1798
02:22:06,446 --> 02:22:14,504
MARISHA: I want to go Minxie and do a little
perimeter walk in the forest a little bit.

1799
02:22:14,504 --> 02:22:21,353
MATT: Okay. The rest of you guys are resting and
finding camp here in a small section of the trees.

1800
02:22:21,353 --> 02:22:26,091
You're on that weird cusp where, looking out
towards the barrier, you can see the dusk light,

1801
02:22:26,091 --> 02:22:31,923
the usual sky of the Feywild, and as you guys back
up to find your camp, a little deeper in the

1802
02:22:31,923 --> 02:22:36,134
forest where it feels safer and less exposed,
looking up, you can still see the dark, starry sky

1803
02:22:36,134 --> 02:22:43,010
and the moon, both visible from your position past
the trees above and past the barrier in front.

1804
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:49,424
As the rest of you are resting, you're finishing
up your reading. You go Minxie form, and you go

1805
02:22:49,424 --> 02:22:51,965
wandering the perimeter. Make a perception check.

1806
02:22:51,965 --> 02:22:58,020
MARISHA: Natural one.

1807
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:00,971
SAM: Looks like a seven. Nope, that's a one.

1808
02:23:00,971 --> 02:23:11,248
MATT: As you're stalking through, looking about,
you catch a scent, a new scent. One you're

1809
02:23:11,248 --> 02:23:18,957
unfamiliar with. It smells sweet, like a freshly
fallen and opened fruit. You immediately

1810
02:23:18,957 --> 02:23:23,303
instinctively look down and sniff across the
ground. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a

1811
02:23:23,303 --> 02:23:32,082
glow as you see two small, humanoid entities with
pairs of wings flutter in in front of you and

1812
02:23:32,082 --> 02:23:35,437
stop. What languages do you know?

1813
02:23:35,437 --> 02:23:39,820
MARISHA: Elven, Sylvan, Primordial.

1814
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:43,474
MATT: Okay. You do understand what they're saying,
as they are both talking to each other in Sylvan.

1815
02:23:43,474 --> 02:23:51,550
One says, "I'm not familiar with this one! I don't
think I've seen this creature in here before."

1816
02:23:51,550 --> 02:23:55,848
The other one glances over and goes, "You don't
think she could've done it?"

1817
02:23:55,848 --> 02:23:58,197
MARISHA: What was that last bit? Sorry.

1818
02:23:58,197 --> 02:24:04,577
MATT: "You don't think that she could've done it?
It's just a cat."

1819
02:24:04,577 --> 02:24:09,173
"Is it, though?" They both get closer and inspect
you. They're both rotating around your face and

1820
02:24:09,173 --> 02:24:13,246
fluttering. One starts pulling on your ear a
little bit, tugging on it.

1821
02:24:13,246 --> 02:24:15,017
MARISHA: I start purring.

1822
02:24:15,017 --> 02:24:21,477
MATT: "It's okay." They move underneath, under
your neck, and scratch just a little bit.

1823
02:24:21,477 --> 02:24:29,483
The other one backs up and goes, "We have to keep
looking. Something did this."

1824
02:24:29,483 --> 02:24:35,554
MARISHA: I wait for a second, and then start
stalking them.

1825
02:24:35,554 --> 02:24:37,187
MATT: You follow them?

1826
02:24:37,187 --> 02:24:38,150
MARISHA: Yeah.

1827
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:40,904
MATT: Okay. The rest of you guys are taking a
rest. You continue reading.

1828
02:24:40,904 --> 02:24:43,326
LAURA: I'm awake. I'm keeping guard.

1829
02:24:43,326 --> 02:24:56,540
MATT: They stop and move, stop and move. They're
doing a full perimeter. Apparently, they are some

1830
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:59,803
sort of a search party. Occasionally, you can hear
bits and pieces of conversation at a distance,

1831
02:24:59,803 --> 02:25:05,955
thanks to your better hearing as Minxie, but not
incredible bits. They're discussing a scare.

1832
02:25:05,955 --> 02:25:19,893
They're discussing the enchantment that was
placed. They're discussing new intrusion. That's

1833
02:25:19,893 --> 02:25:26,670
about the most you can make out of the
conversation. You continue to follow them. You're

1834
02:25:26,670 --> 02:25:29,293
going into the second or third hour of following
them, and they're

1835
02:25:29,293 --> 02:25:32,352
still doing a wide perimeter in the forest. 
They meet up with a third

1836
02:25:32,352 --> 02:25:34,835
one, and they have a quick little discussion and
then branch off.

1837
02:25:34,835 --> 02:25:36,601
MARISHA: Can I hear the little discussion,
anything?

1838
02:25:36,601 --> 02:25:37,839
MATT: If you want to get closer.

1839
02:25:37,839 --> 02:25:38,685
MARISHA: Yeah.

1840
02:25:38,685 --> 02:25:39,908
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.

1841
02:25:39,908 --> 02:25:52,797
MARISHA: I have stealth as Minxie. I get benefits,
right, as a tiger? Oh, yeah, I do. Oh, not good. Ten.

1842
02:25:52,797 --> 02:25:58,123
MATT: All right. As you creep forward in the
middle of their discussion, the three of them all

1843
02:25:58,123 --> 02:26:03,170
whip around at you. One of them pulls a wand out
and puts it out in front, and the other two back up.

1844
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:06,110
MARISHA: I just start eating grass.

1845
02:26:06,110 --> 02:26:14,447
LAURA: That's totally tiger-like.

1846
02:26:14,447 --> 02:26:19,174
MATT: The two that saw you before are like, "She's
been following us."

1847
02:26:19,174 --> 02:26:21,816
"Why?"

1848
02:26:21,816 --> 02:26:25,960
MARISHA: I roll over and show my belly.

1849
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:36,628
MATT: The one that has the wand out goes, "I don't
want to take chances." Puts the wand out. How many

1850
02:26:36,628 --> 02:26:39,586
hit points do you have? In Minxie form?

1851
02:26:39,586 --> 02:26:45,593
LIAM: Shuffle shuffle, flip page, flip page, flip
page.

1852
02:26:45,593 --> 02:26:57,321
MARISHA: Sorry. 52. They're going to Finger of
Death me, aren't they? They're going to do

1853
02:26:57,321 --> 02:26:58,726
something bad.

1854
02:26:58,726 --> 02:27:04,410
MATT: Okay. Raises the wand. There's a slight
tingling sensation, and then nothing happens, and

1855
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:14,405
looks at the wand. "Strange." They all convene
and start whispering to each other very close.

1856
02:27:14,405 --> 02:27:17,545
MARISHA: I look distracted with other stuff. I
sniff and wander off.

1857
02:27:17,545 --> 02:27:20,380
MATT: They separate a bit.

1858
02:27:20,380 --> 02:27:22,700
MARISHA: Just doing cat-like things.

1859
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:24,499
LIAM: Just start pissing.

1860
02:27:24,499 --> 02:27:27,639
MARISHA: I mark my territory. I spray a little
bit.

1861
02:27:27,639 --> 02:27:32,607
LAURA: Gross. That's foul, Keyleth.

1862
02:27:32,607 --> 02:27:36,160
MATT: You hear one of them say, "We can always
correct it later, but best to be safe than sorry."

1863
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:39,513
As you're peeing, I need you to make a--

1864
02:27:39,513 --> 02:27:50,076
LAURA: If she gets petrified while she's pissing,
it's going to be--

1865
02:27:50,076 --> 02:27:54,129
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

1866
02:27:54,129 --> 02:28:01,009
SAM: It's either a one or a 20.

1867
02:28:01,009 --> 02:28:06,349
MARISHA: I'll just start a new one. Don't worry
about it. Fuck, why?

1868
02:28:06,349 --> 02:28:09,519
TRAVIS: Is this shit on camera? We're recording,
right?

1869
02:28:09,519 --> 02:28:13,244
MARISHA: That one's a 19, can I go with the 19?

1870
02:28:13,244 --> 02:28:15,359
MATT: You can't take it off the table before it's
real.

1871
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:17,608
TRAVIS: Twice in a fucking row? What are the
chances? Do it again.

1872
02:28:17,608 --> 02:28:28,641
MARISHA: Oh, that's a 16, that's good. Saving
throw, so 21.

1873
02:28:28,641 --> 02:28:31,409
MATT: Constitution saving throw is 21 total?

1874
02:28:31,409 --> 02:28:34,439
MARISHA: I've got my ring of protection, which
gives me a plus two.

1875
02:28:34,439 --> 02:28:44,095
MATT: Oh, right. So as you're peeing, you feel
another warm tingle over one shoulder, and you

1876
02:28:44,095 --> 02:28:50,146
feel your muscles tense a little bit, and then
relax as the effect passes over you to no effect.

1877
02:28:50,146 --> 02:28:59,783
The three pixies go, "We have to tell her. I don't
trust it." And they all flutter off.

1878
02:28:59,783 --> 02:29:02,500
MARISHA: Okay. I head back to camp.

1879
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:11,937
MATT: A few hours pass. Keyleth hasn't returned.
You're still reading.

1880
02:29:11,937 --> 02:29:18,709
LAURA: Keyleth? Keyleth, dear? Shit.

1881
02:29:18,709 --> 02:29:21,388
MARISHA: Whenever I'm back.

1882
02:29:21,388 --> 02:29:24,746
LAURA: Shit. I go and I kick Vax awake.

1883
02:29:24,746 --> 02:29:26,243
LIAM: Ow. Why did you do that?

1884
02:29:26,243 --> 02:29:28,316
LAURA: Oi. Your girlfriend's not back yet.

1885
02:29:28,316 --> 02:29:29,795
LIAM: What do you mean?

1886
02:29:29,795 --> 02:29:32,985
LAURA: She went off prowling as Minxie and she's not
home.

1887
02:29:32,985 --> 02:29:34,305
LIAM: I take off flying.

1888
02:29:34,305 --> 02:29:35,466
LAURA: Fucking A.

1889
02:29:35,466 --> 02:29:41,641
MARISHA: Oh jesus. Oh man. I'm a big girl, come
on.

1890
02:29:41,641 --> 02:29:45,267
LAURA: That is not what I meant for you to do.

1891
02:29:45,267 --> 02:29:52,210
MATT: This is your first time really trying out
your wings. You're also in a very dense forest, so

1892
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:58,378
there's no space. As you heroically take off, you
impact. Your wing hits a branch, and you go

1893
02:29:58,378 --> 02:30:00,007
spinning out of the way.

1894
02:30:00,007 --> 02:30:04,135
LIAM: Can I Spider-Man from tree to tree like the
werewolves did using the wings a little bit?

1895
02:30:04,135 --> 02:30:12,464
MATT: You're trying to. Make an acrobatics check
with disadvantage.

1896
02:30:12,464 --> 02:30:15,374
TRAVIS: It's like a Plinko machine.

1897
02:30:15,374 --> 02:30:18,758
LIAM: 28.

1898
02:30:18,758 --> 02:30:27,191
MATT: With disadvantage? You manage to not fall on
your face, but it is a very clumsy-looking ascent.

1899
02:30:27,191 --> 02:30:34,361
You make it, but a wingspan of that size, amongst
tree-tops, is going to do very little other than

1900
02:30:34,361 --> 02:30:37,927
what your general leaping would do. You get a
little bit of gliding space from point to point.

1901
02:30:37,927 --> 02:30:39,837
LIAM: I'm still fucking asleep is the problem.

1902
02:30:39,837 --> 02:30:47,943
MATT: Yeah. But you don't fall. All right, so
we'll say for the next couple hours you guys

1903
02:30:47,943 --> 02:30:52,333
do-si-do in the forest until eventually you do
convene. Your wings wear off, and you find

1904
02:30:52,333 --> 02:30:58,133
yourself back at the camp, Minxie safely arriving
just as you finish your final page of your book.

1905
02:30:58,133 --> 02:31:11,935
SAM: And it was all a dream. What a shitty ending.
Who knew? It was terribly hacky and derivative,

1906
02:31:11,935 --> 02:31:15,130
and it read like Fifty Shades of Grey.

1907
02:31:15,130 --> 02:31:17,742
LAURA: Scanlan, you--

1908
02:31:17,742 --> 02:31:20,790
SAM: What? Something different about me?

1909
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:23,678
LAURA: I don't know. Did you do your hair
differently today?

1910
02:31:23,678 --> 02:31:25,507
LIAM: Are you shorter?

1911
02:31:25,507 --> 02:31:30,767
SAM: I feel so interesting.

1912
02:31:30,767 --> 02:31:32,833
LIAM: That's impossible.

1913
02:31:32,833 --> 02:31:34,483
SAM: It could be.

1914
02:31:34,483 --> 02:31:42,998
MATT: And Scanlan goes right into the deepest
slumber he's ever experienced.

1915
02:31:42,998 --> 02:31:45,243
LAURA: Good. You guys are back, everybody's safe,
everything's good?

1916
02:31:45,243 --> 02:31:50,351
MARISHA: So I stalked a couple of fairies for
several hours.

1917
02:31:50,351 --> 02:31:52,993
LIAM: I know all this. She told me two hours ago.

1918
02:31:52,993 --> 02:31:58,405
MARISHA: Yes, I caught him up a little bit as we
were walking back. Pretty sure it is the fairies

1919
02:31:58,405 --> 02:32:02,913
who are creating the magical barrier, and I'm
pretty sure it's because we might've scared the

1920
02:32:02,913 --> 02:32:11,377
living shit out of them, so it might've all been
still our fault all along, like most things are,

1921
02:32:11,377 --> 02:32:15,331
so we'll talk to the fairies tomorrow.

1922
02:32:15,331 --> 02:32:17,992
LAURA: If they don't find us.

1923
02:32:17,992 --> 02:32:20,351
MARISHA: They are actively looking for us.

1924
02:32:20,351 --> 02:32:22,706
TRAVIS: They saw you.

1925
02:32:22,706 --> 02:32:24,647
MARISHA: They saw me as a cat.

1926
02:32:24,647 --> 02:32:26,451
TRAVIS: What did they do to you?

1927
02:32:26,451 --> 02:32:32,412
MARISHA: I think they tried to cast several spells
on me, and by some luck of the draw, I managed to

1928
02:32:32,412 --> 02:32:42,968
feline my way out of them. I think they are
looking for me and us, and I won't be a tiger

1929
02:32:42,968 --> 02:32:44,804
anymore.

1930
02:32:44,804 --> 02:32:51,086
LAURA: Can I use my ranger abilities and try to
disguise where we're camping?

1931
02:32:51,086 --> 02:32:53,139
MARISHA: Can I help hide? I'll help her a little
bit.

1932
02:32:53,139 --> 02:32:56,855
MATT: You guys find a little alcove by one of the
bigger trees nearby that has some of the roots

1933
02:32:56,855 --> 02:33:03,347
recess inward, and you build a small camp there
that's covered with thatch and branches.

1934
02:33:03,347 --> 02:33:06,772
LIAM: Do we have any concept of what time it is in
this perpetual night?

1935
02:33:06,772 --> 02:33:09,104
MATT: You really have none.

1936
02:33:09,104 --> 02:33:15,855
LAURA: I'm going to get a little sleep, though, so
I can get my spells back. Anybody else taking

1937
02:33:15,855 --> 02:33:16,999
watch?

1938
02:33:16,999 --> 02:33:18,712
LIAM: Yeah, stay up with me.

1939
02:33:18,712 --> 02:33:19,902
MARISHA: Okay.

1940
02:33:19,902 --> 02:33:21,712
TALIESIN: She needs to rest.

1941
02:33:21,712 --> 02:33:22,964
TRAVIS: I'll stay up.

1942
02:33:22,964 --> 02:33:24,522
MATT: She's already been up for four hours.

1943
02:33:24,522 --> 02:33:25,595
LIAM: Stay up with me.

1944
02:33:25,595 --> 02:33:27,329
TRAVIS: You can cuddle with me.

1945
02:33:27,329 --> 02:33:28,666
LIAM: Don't offer that.

1946
02:33:28,666 --> 02:33:30,377
TRAVIS: I know.

1947
02:33:30,377 --> 02:33:33,709
MARISHA: Okay. I will sleep, then, I guess.

1948
02:33:33,709 --> 02:33:36,530
MATT: Go ahead and nap. You guys are staying up.

1949
02:33:36,530 --> 02:33:41,599
MARISHA: I pick a space near Vax.

1950
02:33:41,599 --> 02:33:45,209
MATT: You guys make perception checks, both of
you.

1951
02:33:45,209 --> 02:33:51,834
TRAVIS: Ten.

1952
02:33:51,834 --> 02:33:53,568
LIAM: 27.

1953
02:33:53,568 --> 02:34:03,012
MATT: Okay. Partway into your watch, you do see,
whereas there was the very faint, ever-present

1954
02:34:03,012 --> 02:34:10,581
falling of the fey lights, you do see what looks
to be two brighter lights that are traveling

1955
02:34:10,581 --> 02:34:14,932
together, shifting about a little ways past your
sight.

1956
02:34:14,932 --> 02:34:16,985
LIAM: Do you see that?

1957
02:34:16,985 --> 02:34:18,250
TRAVIS: Yeah, fireflies.

1958
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:25,854
LIAM: No. Well, sort of. Let's watch them. I don't
think we should go out. I think we should let the

1959
02:34:25,854 --> 02:34:27,161
group rest.

1960
02:34:27,161 --> 02:34:28,898
TRAVIS: What, the little lights?

1961
02:34:28,898 --> 02:34:35,556
LIAM: No, your friends. We'll let them sleep
unless those things come closer.

1962
02:34:35,556 --> 02:34:37,060
TRAVIS: Oh.

1963
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:40,339
LIAM: Are they coming closer, or are they keeping
their distance?

1964
02:34:40,339 --> 02:34:43,606
MATT: They're keeping a distance. They don't seem
to notice you.

1965
02:34:43,606 --> 02:34:47,852
LAURA: They might've heard you.

1966
02:34:47,852 --> 02:34:56,232
MATT: All right, they come pretty close, actually.
They start heading in your direction. Do you guys

1967
02:34:56,232 --> 02:34:58,621
do anything? Are you going to stay quiet? What do
you do?

1968
02:34:58,621 --> 02:35:00,590
LIAM: Don't move. I go stealth.

1969
02:35:00,590 --> 02:35:04,531
TRAVIS: I freeze in an exotic pose.

1970
02:35:04,531 --> 02:35:09,382
MATT: Make a stealth check with advantage because
of the camouflage that she put.

1971
02:35:09,382 --> 02:35:11,498
LIAM: Do I have that camouflage?

1972
02:35:11,498 --> 02:35:16,722
MATT: You already have your crazy bonuses, but
yeah, take advantage on that.

1973
02:35:16,722 --> 02:35:18,161
LIAM: 25.

1974
02:35:18,161 --> 02:35:19,505
TRAVIS: Eight.

1975
02:35:19,505 --> 02:35:21,105
MATT: Total of eight? With advantage?

1976
02:35:21,105 --> 02:35:22,615
TRAVIS: A six and a two.

1977
02:35:22,615 --> 02:35:25,483
LIAM: Come on, Grog! Come on.

1978
02:35:25,483 --> 02:35:42,156
MATT: All right. As they drift past, you hear a
fart, which isn't what catches their attention.

1979
02:35:42,156 --> 02:35:51,961
It's the pause after, and Grog uncontrollably
laughing at it, partially because the intent of

1980
02:35:51,961 --> 02:35:57,274
Keyleth staying close to Vax while you guys were
resting, and it went in her direction.

1981
02:35:57,274 --> 02:36:04,721
MARISHA: I shuffle uncomfortably in my sleep. I
don't know why I just had a nightmare.

1982
02:36:04,721 --> 02:36:11,482
MATT: You watch as two of these fluttering points
of light about ten feet out.

1983
02:36:11,482 --> 02:36:13,272
LIAM: I'm staying still.

1984
02:36:13,272 --> 02:36:17,882
MATT: Stay there for a second, and then go darting
off into the distance.

1985
02:36:17,882 --> 02:36:19,643
TRAVIS: One look and they ran.

1986
02:36:19,643 --> 02:36:22,603
LIAM: We have to talk about your diet.

1987
02:36:22,603 --> 02:36:23,736
TRAVIS: What?

1988
02:36:23,736 --> 02:36:26,467
LIAM: Your diet! Do you eat any greens at all?

1989
02:36:26,467 --> 02:36:29,245
TRAVIS: Yeah, pickled herring, and I've been
grabbing stuff as we walk through.

1990
02:36:29,245 --> 02:36:39,244
MARISHA: That just happened. He wants to talk
about your IBS, and there are lycans.

1991
02:36:39,244 --> 02:36:49,207
LIAM: I crawl over to my sister and shake her and
say: wake up!

1992
02:36:49,207 --> 02:36:50,349
LAURA: What?

1993
02:36:50,349 --> 02:36:55,447
LIAM: Don't fly away like I did. Oh, wait, your
broom's over there, all right. They are watching

1994
02:36:55,447 --> 02:37:01,274
us. They came in close, and then they left, so I
don't think we're safe anymore.

1995
02:37:01,274 --> 02:37:03,354
LAURA: So we fucking should get out of here?

1996
02:37:03,354 --> 02:37:04,601
LIAM: Maybe, yeah.

1997
02:37:04,601 --> 02:37:06,056
LAURA: Wake everybody up!

1998
02:37:06,056 --> 02:37:09,494
TRAVIS: No, look. We've got to talk to them
anyway, right? We're not going to run.

1999
02:37:09,494 --> 02:37:12,041
LAURA: At least we can prepare ourselves.

2000
02:37:12,041 --> 02:37:13,354
TRAVIS: How?

2001
02:37:13,354 --> 02:37:15,166
TALIESIN: Sleeping.

2002
02:37:15,166 --> 02:37:17,265
TRAVIS: Yeah, just keep sleeping.

2003
02:37:17,265 --> 02:37:19,001
LAURA: I wake Percival up.

2004
02:37:19,001 --> 02:37:19,954
TRAVIS: No!

2005
02:37:19,954 --> 02:37:20,975
LAURA: Percy.

2006
02:37:20,975 --> 02:37:23,657
TALIESIN: What? Yes?

2007
02:37:23,657 --> 02:37:24,788
LAURA: Hi, grumpy.

2008
02:37:24,788 --> 02:37:26,545
TALIESIN: What?

2009
02:37:26,545 --> 02:37:28,596
LAURA: We've been discovered by fairies.

2010
02:37:28,596 --> 02:37:30,099
TALIESIN: That's nice.

2011
02:37:30,099 --> 02:37:32,177
LAURA: Get ready to use your charming wiles.

2012
02:37:32,177 --> 02:37:33,418
TALIESIN: All right.

2013
02:37:33,418 --> 02:37:36,617
LAURA: I'm going to let Scanlan sleep a little bit
more, because he looks fucking exhausted.

2014
02:37:36,617 --> 02:37:40,721
LIAM: That's it, you put him back to sleep? You go
back to bed, then.

2015
02:37:40,721 --> 02:37:49,138
LAURA: All right, fine. Can we make things look
fancy around here so when they all come back, we

2016
02:37:49,138 --> 02:37:52,124
look like we're ready to talk to them?

2017
02:37:52,124 --> 02:38:02,300
TALIESIN: I slowly crawl out. I pull out a piece
of parchment, and I write: Hello, fairies. We're

2018
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:08,179
napping. And I put it on the tree above us and go
back to sleep.

2019
02:38:08,179 --> 02:38:10,301
LIAM: You're letting Whitey go back to sleep,
then?

2020
02:38:10,301 --> 02:38:16,510
LAURA: Whitey? Are you calling him Whitey as a
nickname?

2021
02:38:16,510 --> 02:38:21,653
LIAM: Yeah. I think it's apt. Fuck it. I go back
to bed. I spoon Keyleth and fall asleep.

2022
02:38:21,653 --> 02:38:25,350
MARISHA: I'll allow it.

2023
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:29,452
TRAVIS: I actually go back to sleep, too.

2024
02:38:29,452 --> 02:38:34,027
LAURA: What in the fuck is going on here? How is
this happening?

2025
02:38:34,027 --> 02:38:36,900
MATT: Vex, you're the only one awake.

2026
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:40,948
TALIESIN: All right, fine, my watch. I'll get up.

2027
02:38:40,948 --> 02:38:42,576
LAURA: I'm going to sit up.

2028
02:38:42,576 --> 02:38:44,019
TALIESIN: I sit up and take the watch.

2029
02:38:44,019 --> 02:38:48,450
LAURA: Oh, you know what, I'm going to put out the
little gold tea set, and I'm going to act like

2030
02:38:48,450 --> 02:38:50,466
we're welcoming them to tea whenever they show
up.

2031
02:38:50,466 --> 02:38:55,840
TALIESIN: I will take the watch, and I will make
some tea with the tea set.

2032
02:38:55,840 --> 02:39:05,963
TRAVIS: The cups are bigger than they are. Oh, you
made drowning pots for us all. How lovely. It's

2033
02:39:05,963 --> 02:39:07,762
going to be a threat.

2034
02:39:07,762 --> 02:39:09,961
LAURA: I never did actually find out what this tea
set does.

2035
02:39:09,961 --> 02:39:11,515
TALIESIN: We're about to find out, then, aren't
we?

2036
02:39:11,515 --> 02:39:14,922
LAURA: Oh, you know what, and I take out my old
wooden music box that I discovered.

2037
02:39:14,922 --> 02:39:18,255
LIAM: Yes, pull out all of your cursed items.

2038
02:39:18,255 --> 02:39:21,566
LAURA: And I wind it up and make some pretty
music.

2039
02:39:21,566 --> 02:39:24,446
SAM: Like a crazy grandma in the woods.

2040
02:39:24,446 --> 02:39:28,798
TALIESIN: I am joining you for this ridiculous tea
party.

2041
02:39:28,798 --> 02:39:33,002
LAURA: I like it, thank you. Don't drink out of
the teacups, because I really think they might be

2042
02:39:33,002 --> 02:39:41,215
cursed. Seriously, Percy, I know it's appealing to
you, but don't get cursed again, all right?

2043
02:39:41,215 --> 02:39:53,416
MATT: All right, so. You guys prepare your tea.
You set up your music box. A couple more hours

2044
02:39:53,416 --> 02:39:58,307
pass, the rest of you coming to a semblance of a
restful sleep. The only ones who didn't get a

2045
02:39:58,307 --> 02:40:06,806
restful sleep on this would be Vex and... Percy?

2046
02:40:06,806 --> 02:40:09,933
TALIESIN: I specifically did not join those
conversations.

2047
02:40:09,933 --> 02:40:16,871
MATT: You barely got in there. You do not get your
spells back, unfortunately. Scanlan, you reduce

2048
02:40:17,016 --> 02:40:18,824
your exhaustion by one point.

2049
02:40:18,824 --> 02:40:20,195
SAM: Oh, I got sleep?

2050
02:40:20,195 --> 02:40:24,655
MATT: You did, yes, so you're down to only one
point, which means your speed is no longer

2051
02:40:24,655 --> 02:40:25,700
halved.

2052
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:31,010
SAM: Oh, I had two points of exhaustion? I thought
it was just one.

2053
02:40:31,010 --> 02:40:32,389
MATT: You wanted to keep reading.

2054
02:40:32,389 --> 02:40:34,143
LIAM: Hair is shiny, eyes are bright.

2055
02:40:34,143 --> 02:40:36,759
TALIESIN: Your charisma's up by two, which
means--

2056
02:40:36,759 --> 02:40:38,557
SAM: No, I already did it.

2057
02:40:38,557 --> 02:40:47,717
MATT: At this point, towards the end of this watch
here, you see as a cluster of seven lights now

2058
02:40:47,717 --> 02:40:50,858
start swarming in your direction.

2059
02:40:50,858 --> 02:40:52,896
LAURA: Oh, good.

2060
02:40:52,896 --> 02:40:54,531
MARISHA: Are we awake?

2061
02:40:54,531 --> 02:41:00,408
MATT: You're starting to come to as Vex begins to
nudge you guys to consciousness.

2062
02:41:00,408 --> 02:41:01,820
SAM: Do I get spells back?

2063
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:02,971
MATT: You do.

2064
02:41:02,971 --> 02:41:07,733
LAURA: Oi, Scanlan. Sing a happy tune about how
much we love fairies.

2065
02:41:07,733 --> 02:41:14,924
SAM: Oh, sure. I love singing happy tunes. About
fairies?

2066
02:41:14,924 --> 02:41:16,774
LAURA: Yeah, like how pretty they are.

2067
02:41:16,774 --> 02:41:19,589
SAM: How about I just sing a happy tune?

2068
02:41:19,589 --> 02:41:20,958
LAURA: Sounds good, too.

2069
02:41:20,958 --> 02:41:33,100
SAM: I'll sing a song about myself. The best kind
of songs. (singing) Cube, glorious cube! You

2070
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:44,410
really should try it. If you're in the mood, I
won't even hide it. I'll pull down my trousers for

2071
02:41:44,410 --> 02:41:54,667
any gal or dude, O cube, glorious cube, wonderful
cube, magical cube!

2072
02:41:54,667 --> 02:42:06,553
MATT: The sounds of your voice, accompanied by the
music box playing through the air as the Wisher

2073
02:42:06,553 --> 02:42:16,517
pixies arrive, at least this troupe of them come
rushing up. You see they are all behind one that

2074
02:42:16,517 --> 02:42:20,523
appears to have-- while all of them have a slight
white with a hint of pinkish glow, there is one

2075
02:42:20,523 --> 02:42:28,447
that has a deeper purple halo around it. As they
all approach, they stop, and the purple one goes

2076
02:42:28,447 --> 02:42:37,359
up to the paper that was left on the tree. "So!
Enjoy your nap?"

2077
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:43,647
LAURA: I wasn't quite rested, but it was lovely
here.

2078
02:42:43,647 --> 02:42:45,914
TALIESIN: There is tea. Would you like some tea?

2079
02:42:45,914 --> 02:42:48,414
SAM: We might have straws.

2080
02:42:48,414 --> 02:42:59,313
TALIESIN: I am tempted to fashion the thing that I
use to pour my molds into little sippy cups that

2081
02:42:59,313 --> 02:43:00,831
can be shared.

2082
02:43:00,831 --> 02:43:06,227
LAURA: We've been trying to prepare for your
coming. Unfortunately, we don't have very much to

2083
02:43:06,227 --> 02:43:07,941
make it appropriate.

2084
02:43:07,941 --> 02:43:11,512
TALIESIN: We are aware we need to have a
conversation. Good morning.

2085
02:43:11,512 --> 02:43:19,202
MATT: "Yes, we do." And the other pixies flutter
down to the ground. She flutters down, as well,

2086
02:43:19,202 --> 02:43:21,324
and they approach the tea set.

2087
02:43:21,324 --> 02:43:25,107
MARISHA: I say good morning to them in Sylvan.

2088
02:43:25,107 --> 02:43:33,679
MATT: They all look over, and they give a slight
curtsey bow. You now have a closer look at them.

2089
02:43:33,679 --> 02:43:46,369
They're all various lithe young men and women with
little leaf-based or vine-based bits of attire.

2090
02:43:46,369 --> 02:43:55,710
The one that has the purplish halo is an older one
with whiter hair that's a little wild around the

2091
02:43:55,710 --> 02:44:02,483
face. You can see the wings themselves look a
little more tattered and worn. She's probably the

2092
02:44:02,483 --> 02:44:10,038
respected elder of the troupe that's there. As they
all step forward, she inspects the tea set and

2093
02:44:10,038 --> 02:44:12,062
looks up. "So."

2094
02:44:12,062 --> 02:44:20,475
LAURA: I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding.
You see, we were trying to pass through these

2095
02:44:20,475 --> 02:44:25,246
woods, and we ran into a band of very big, very
mean-looking wolves.

2096
02:44:25,246 --> 02:44:31,758
MATT: All the pixies at once go (gasps) and they
pull back. The purple one says, "You ran into them?"

2097
02:44:31,758 --> 02:44:37,830
SAM: Not only did we run into them, but they
forced us against our will to attempt to do you

2098
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:39,155
harm.

2099
02:44:39,155 --> 02:44:41,024
LAURA: Which, of course, we didn't want to do.

2100
02:44:41,024 --> 02:44:43,511
TALIESIN: So we thought we would just trick them.

2101
02:44:43,511 --> 02:44:48,861
MATT: The pixies at this point are darting around
to each of you. You each have a pixie hovering

2102
02:44:48,861 --> 02:44:59,087
right in front of you, quickly inspecting your
bodies. You can see now the central one, the

2103
02:44:59,087 --> 02:45:02,016
glowing purple, is in the air, backing up.

2104
02:45:02,016 --> 02:45:07,014
MARISHA: They didn't bite any of us or get any of
us. We're not infected.

2105
02:45:07,014 --> 02:45:13,791
MATT: They all look around. You see the pixies all
turn back, looking, okay. One of them by Grog

2106
02:45:13,791 --> 02:45:18,799
turns and goes, "He's been wounded!" Pointing at
his head.

2107
02:45:18,799 --> 02:45:21,111
LAURA: His cut?

2108
02:45:21,111 --> 02:45:22,942
TALIESIN: Oh, that was him.

2109
02:45:22,942 --> 02:45:28,027
SAM: I cut his eyebrow, and then he fucked himself
by trying to smash through the barrier that I

2110
02:45:28,027 --> 02:45:29,514
assume you created.

2111
02:45:29,514 --> 02:45:32,263
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't go through that wall. But
bidet.

2112
02:45:32,263 --> 02:45:37,039
TALIESIN: We're on a mission, though.

2113
02:45:37,039 --> 02:45:39,194
LAURA: A great mission.

2114
02:45:39,194 --> 02:45:47,589
MATT: "If we are to continue this conversation, we
need comfort. He is disquieting. Allow us."

2115
02:45:47,589 --> 02:45:49,071
LAURA: What are you going to--

2116
02:45:49,071 --> 02:45:52,455
TRAVIS: No, it's cool. Please, do as you will.

2117
02:45:52,455 --> 02:45:54,509
LIAM: What are we talking about?

2118
02:45:54,509 --> 02:45:58,834
TRAVIS: Let them feel at ease. Go ahead.

2119
02:45:58,834 --> 02:46:08,055
MATT: The older one glances over at you. Make a
constitution saving throw.

2120
02:46:08,055 --> 02:46:12,872
TRAVIS: Natural one. (laughs)

2121
02:46:12,872 --> 02:46:19,748
MATT: As you grin, you watch as his flesh goes an
even duller gray color as his entire body turns to

2122
02:46:19,748 --> 02:46:21,455
solid stone.

2123
02:46:21,455 --> 02:46:24,562
LIAM: Is that temporary? Is that going to last?

2124
02:46:24,562 --> 02:46:28,413
MATT: "Now. Let us have a conversation."

2125
02:46:28,413 --> 02:46:33,735
LAURA: Okay.

2126
02:46:33,735 --> 02:46:38,113
MATT: "So. You've encountered these beasts."

2127
02:46:38,113 --> 02:46:39,364
LAURA: Yes.

2128
02:46:39,364 --> 02:46:41,895
MARISHA: And they instructed us to kill you.

2129
02:46:41,895 --> 02:46:43,348
TALIESIN: No, not to kill.

2130
02:46:43,348 --> 02:46:46,958
LAURA: They wanted us to hurt you. To destroy your
circle of stones.

2131
02:46:46,958 --> 02:46:50,319
MATT: "They sent you to come and kill us and
destroy our home?"

2132
02:46:50,319 --> 02:46:54,151
LIAM: We misspoke. To destroy this circle.

2133
02:46:54,151 --> 02:46:59,159
MATT: "You speak in many words that do not meet as
one thought or theory."

2134
02:46:59,159 --> 02:47:01,298
TALIESIN: Well, you're a bit intimidating.

2135
02:47:01,298 --> 02:47:07,673
MATT: As the very tiny pixies all look at each
other and look at you large folk, there's a little

2136
02:47:07,673 --> 02:47:09,341
chuckle under their breath.

2137
02:47:09,341 --> 02:47:15,796
TALIESIN: We are wise enough to not judge a man or
woman by their size, good sir.

2138
02:47:15,796 --> 02:47:25,015
MARISHA: We didn't want to harm you, so we thought
if we just made it look to those silly, dumb

2139
02:47:25,015 --> 02:47:33,962
lycans like we hurt you. By throwing paper balls,
if you will.

2140
02:47:33,962 --> 02:47:36,376
TALIESIN: Stop antagonizing the Grog statue.

2141
02:47:36,376 --> 02:47:45,162
MARISHA: I did just a simple visual spell, and we
tried to move on, as to not get involved.

2142
02:47:45,162 --> 02:47:52,785
SAM: We did everything in our power to protect
you, and to not harm you. If our druid's

2143
02:47:52,785 --> 02:47:57,847
spellcasting frightened you, we apologize, but we
didn't know what else to do.

2144
02:47:57,847 --> 02:48:00,381
TALIESIN: And we have a bog to destroy.

2145
02:48:00,381 --> 02:48:04,066
LAURA: Yes, we're on a very important mission, and
we thought it might be the quickest way to

2146
02:48:04,066 --> 02:48:05,376
complete.

2147
02:48:05,376 --> 02:48:08,217
TALIESIN: There's a cancerous tree that we have
been sent to destroy.

2148
02:48:08,217 --> 02:48:12,563
LIAM: Honestly, we're scared of both you and the
lycan, and we just want to pass through. We want

2149
02:48:12,563 --> 02:48:17,125
no harm for you, and unfortunately, them, either.
We just want to walk on out of here.

2150
02:48:17,125 --> 02:48:21,126
MARISHA: This is not our fight, you see.

2151
02:48:21,126 --> 02:48:29,709
MATT: The older one is glancing about, and a
couple of the pixies drop next to her and whisper

2152
02:48:29,709 --> 02:48:32,389
into her ear, and her eyes are still darting
amongst you.

2153
02:48:32,389 --> 02:48:34,149
MARISHA: Can I understand what they're saying?

2154
02:48:34,149 --> 02:48:40,369
MATT: No, they're very small, and they're very
distant.

2155
02:48:40,369 --> 02:48:48,263
LAURA: That's really, really off-putting.

2156
02:48:48,263 --> 02:48:59,920
MATT: It's impressive. The two pixies separate.
The elder one crosses her fingers. "Few are those

2157
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:07,502
"who would deal with such miscreants and foul
entities as those wolf kin, so much as to give our

2158
02:49:07,502 --> 02:49:14,407
"little hearts a possible scare of death to our
homes in an attempt to escape without but a

2159
02:49:14,407 --> 02:49:21,360
"conversation. This puts us at unease. We do not
like being at unease."

2160
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:25,271
LAURA: Understandable. But we weren't trying to
deal with them. In fact, we made no deal with

2161
02:49:25,271 --> 02:49:31,649
them. We told them we wouldn't make a deal until
we spoke with you. But we were scared. We were too

2162
02:49:31,649 --> 02:49:32,905
scared.

2163
02:49:32,905 --> 02:49:36,876
MARISHA: They were trying to exploit our
abilities. We were being held against our will. We

2164
02:49:36,876 --> 02:49:40,790
were threatened with life or death. There was
nothing personal.

2165
02:49:40,790 --> 02:49:46,238
LIAM: Their leader is massive. We were scared.
This one wet his leg, and he's gigantic. We just

2166
02:49:46,238 --> 02:49:47,831
didn't know what to do.

2167
02:49:47,831 --> 02:49:59,579
MATT: She puts her hands up. "Very well. Mistakes
are made, and punishments are doled out. So. We

2168
02:49:59,579 --> 02:50:10,080
"shall return to our village. We shall lower the
barrier to you, and all shall be fine."

2169
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:12,843
SAM: And our gray stone friend?

2170
02:50:12,843 --> 02:50:19,281
MATT: "He is your punishment for your infraction.
But we've learned our lessons, and you may go

2171
02:50:19,281 --> 02:50:21,082
"about your way."

2172
02:50:21,082 --> 02:50:23,845
SAM: How can we buy his freedom?

2173
02:50:23,845 --> 02:50:27,380
LIAM: We've got a tea set.

2174
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:29,551
LAURA: How can we buy his freedom?

2175
02:50:29,551 --> 02:50:34,834
MATT: "There is no freedom to be bought. In these
worlds, words and actions speak volumes, and

2176
02:50:34,834 --> 02:50:43,253
"you've crossed our people. Right now, we could
take you all as new entries to our garden. We took

2177
02:50:43,253 --> 02:50:50,401
"but one. Be thankful you got off quite as easy.
The Wishers set you free."

2178
02:50:50,401 --> 02:50:52,562
LAURA: Thanks, Wisher.

2179
02:50:52,562 --> 02:50:57,305
MARISHA: It's okay. I can fix it.

2180
02:50:57,305 --> 02:50:59,625
SAM: What? What do you mean?

2181
02:50:59,625 --> 02:51:07,021
MARISHA: I have Greater Restoration. She left,
right? That wasn't in front of her. I didn't say

2182
02:51:07,021 --> 02:51:08,489
that to her.

2183
02:51:08,489 --> 02:51:14,873
MATT: Okay. She says, "Very well. Good luck on
your endeavor." The rest of the pixies gather up

2184
02:51:14,873 --> 02:51:21,309
around Grog's body, and you watch as they all glow
and his stone form, as heavy as it should be,

2185
02:51:21,309 --> 02:51:23,910
suddenly becomes weightless.

2186
02:51:23,910 --> 02:51:25,497
SAM: Wait.

2187
02:51:25,497 --> 02:51:27,077
TALIESIN: Wait, no, we need that.

2188
02:51:27,077 --> 02:51:32,601
MARISHA: Oh, they're taking him. Oh! I cast
Earthbind on Grog.

2189
02:51:32,601 --> 02:51:34,383
SAM: Earthbind?

2190
02:51:34,383 --> 02:51:36,222
MARISHA: Yeah. It should ground him.

2191
02:51:36,222 --> 02:51:44,960
MATT: It does. He slams into the ground with all
the weight of a falling stone goliath into the

2192
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:52,024
dirt. At which point the pixies immediately go off
and turn around. "You would cast incantations

2193
02:51:52,024 --> 02:51:53,624
"towards us?"

2194
02:51:53,624 --> 02:52:00,013
MARISHA: No, I cast it to my friend, who is about
12 foot tall and a giant target. Come on, don't

2195
02:52:00,013 --> 02:52:03,006
make stories up where there aren't any.

2196
02:52:03,006 --> 02:52:04,505
MATT: "Stories, nothing."

2197
02:52:04,505 --> 02:52:12,929
MARISHA: What? You fairies are manifesting these
ideas, okay? You are creating a dichotomy that

2198
02:52:12,929 --> 02:52:14,451
does not exist.

2199
02:52:14,451 --> 02:52:17,026
MATT: They all gather and begin to whisper to each
other, their heads darting around.

2200
02:52:17,026 --> 02:52:18,562
MARISHA: Oh, see, look. They're doing it right
now.

2201
02:52:18,562 --> 02:52:25,748
MATT: At this point: "This display is enough. Your
words and your actions speak in difference, in

2202
02:52:25,748 --> 02:52:35,581
"entirely opposing directions. If you are to
continue to throw these words, these deceptions,

2203
02:52:35,581 --> 02:52:39,775
"these lies in our direction, then perhaps we'll
take you all for our garden."

2204
02:52:39,775 --> 02:52:41,899
TALIESIN: I wouldn't advise that.

2205
02:52:41,899 --> 02:52:51,557
MATT: "Then let us take him, and you move on with
your lesson." And they go and pick him up once

2206
02:52:51,557 --> 02:52:52,558
more.

2207
02:52:52,558 --> 02:52:56,647
LAURA: Wouldn't you rather have a song? Wouldn't
you rather have-- how often do you get a

2208
02:52:56,647 --> 02:52:57,907
performance?

2209
02:52:57,907 --> 02:53:00,931
TALIESIN: I cast Hex on the main pixie.

2210
02:53:00,931 --> 02:53:02,653
MATT: You do?

2211
02:53:02,653 --> 02:53:03,866
TALIESIN: I do.

2212
02:53:03,866 --> 02:53:09,151
SAM: That's it, it's on. I call out to the main
pixie: Wait. What's your name?

2213
02:53:09,151 --> 02:53:14,208
MATT: At this point, you guys watch as a shadow
all of a sudden darts up from the ground and

2214
02:53:14,208 --> 02:53:21,567
clings around the pixie. She whips around, at
which point you now hear another (impact) as the

2215
02:53:21,567 --> 02:53:25,036
stone Grog slams into the ground, all the pixies
scattering around.

2216
02:53:25,036 --> 02:53:29,157
MARISHA: See, <i>that</i> is what it looks like when an
incantation is targeted at you.

2217
02:53:29,157 --> 02:53:31,960
TALIESIN: It's not very nice, is it?

2218
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:42,782
MATT: You now watch as all of the various very
gently falling fairy lights begin to (flitting) and be

2219
02:53:42,782 --> 02:53:49,556
absorbed by the pixies of the forest. As their
glows intensify, the purple halo growing, you see

2220
02:53:49,556 --> 02:53:59,894
the central elder figure of the Wisher pixies say,
"At least our allegiances now lie bare." I need

2221
02:53:59,894 --> 02:54:02,163
you all to roll initiative.

2222
02:54:02,163 --> 02:54:03,412
LAURA: Can you quickly--

2223
02:54:03,412 --> 02:54:08,479
MARISHA: It's one action. It's one fucking action.
I just looked it up for that reason. That's not

2224
02:54:08,479 --> 02:54:10,443
good. That's not a good initiative at all.

2225
02:54:10,443 --> 02:54:14,053
LAURA: Natural 20 on an initiative. I don't know
what I can do to them.

2226
02:54:14,053 --> 02:54:15,590
TALIESIN: 27.

2227
02:54:15,590 --> 02:54:18,922
MARISHA: I notoriously roll terrible on my
initiative.

2228
02:54:18,922 --> 02:54:20,306
SAM: How many are there?

2229
02:54:20,306 --> 02:54:22,118
TALIESIN: A lot, but they die quick.

2230
02:54:22,118 --> 02:54:23,600
MARISHA: Are they going to form a--

2231
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:24,861
LAURA: A Voltron?

2232
02:54:24,861 --> 02:54:26,915
MARISHA: That's exactly what I was thinking,
yeah.

2233
02:54:26,915 --> 02:54:29,338
LAURA: I feel like it would be easier to hit if it
was a giant Voltron.

2234
02:54:29,338 --> 02:54:37,694
LIAM: Oh, that angle is not going to be kind to
those trees.

2235
02:54:37,694 --> 02:54:48,616
TALIESIN: What's the best check to give him? I can
give him disadvantage on an ability check. So

2236
02:54:48,616 --> 02:54:51,124
wisdom or intelligence?

2237
02:54:51,124 --> 02:54:55,283
LIAM: The werewolves were honorable. These guys
are assholes.

2238
02:54:55,283 --> 02:54:56,553
LAURA: Yeah, I know.

2239
02:54:56,553 --> 02:54:58,114
TALIESIN: I feel better about killing them.

2240
02:54:58,114 --> 02:55:01,199
LAURA: Me, too. They're dicks. They were going to
take Grog.

2241
02:55:01,199 --> 02:55:09,650
MARISHA: They were trying to take Grog. Fucking
assholes. I feel like we were very reasonable,

2242
02:55:09,650 --> 02:55:13,012
considering how unreasonable we normally are.

2243
02:55:13,012 --> 02:55:15,471
SAM: We were put between a rock and hard place.

2244
02:55:15,471 --> 02:55:17,322
MARISHA: And a hard Grog.

2245
02:55:17,322 --> 02:55:24,964
SAM: And we had no choice. Really. It was a bad
situation.

2246
02:55:24,964 --> 02:55:36,053
LAURA: Grog is on the ground? Oh, he is on the
ground.

2247
02:55:36,053 --> 02:55:38,293
MATT: Yes, he is.

2248
02:55:38,293 --> 02:55:40,695
TRAVIS: I'm stoned.

2249
02:55:40,695 --> 02:55:49,574
SAM: If Grog is permanently corrupted, we know
that we can download a fresh one from

2250
02:55:49,574 --> 02:55:51,107
Backblaze.com.

2251
02:55:51,107 --> 02:55:54,224
(laughter)

2252
02:55:54,224 --> 02:55:57,434
TRAVIS: Beautiful. That was too good.

2253
02:55:57,434 --> 02:56:02,151
TALIESIN: Just couldn't let it go. I'm so sorry. I
just couldn't let it go.

2254
02:56:02,151 --> 02:56:10,420
MARISHA: Was that my fault this time? it was a
mild combination. I might have contributed.

2255
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:12,360
SAM: We should've fought the fucking werewolves.

2256
02:56:12,360 --> 02:56:15,100
LAURA: Yeah, we should've, but we didn't, because
we're idiots.

2257
02:56:15,100 --> 02:56:20,376
MATT: All right, initiative order. We have 25 to
20?

2258
02:56:20,376 --> 02:56:21,661
TALIESIN: 27.

2259
02:56:21,661 --> 02:56:24,062
LAURA: 27, as well, with a natural 20.

2260
02:56:24,062 --> 02:56:27,017
SAM: 21 for me.

2261
02:56:27,017 --> 02:56:30,072
TALIESIN: We are some fast motherfuckers.

2262
02:56:30,072 --> 02:56:32,888
SAM: I got sleep.

2263
02:56:32,888 --> 02:56:38,609
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

2264
02:56:38,609 --> 02:56:46,115
LAURA: Those fairies are so spread out. I thought
they would all be together.

2265
02:56:46,115 --> 02:56:49,825
MATT: As soon as they dropped, they fanned out.

2266
02:56:49,825 --> 02:56:52,585
TALIESIN: We were trying really hard not to shoot
first.

2267
02:56:52,585 --> 02:56:53,917
MATT: 15 to ten?

2268
02:56:53,917 --> 02:56:55,500
LIAM: 13.

2269
02:56:55,500 --> 02:57:04,004
MATT: Ten to five? And Grog is stone. Sorry,
buddy.

2270
02:57:04,004 --> 02:57:07,937
MARISHA: You first, bud. Coming for you first.

2271
02:57:07,937 --> 02:57:11,800
MATT: All righty. Top of the round, Percy and Vex,
you're up first.

2272
02:57:11,800 --> 02:57:15,268
TALIESIN: Where's the one that I hexed?

2273
02:57:15,268 --> 02:57:21,285
MATT: The one that you hexed, which I will mark
here, looking overhead you can see is the one with

2274
02:57:21,285 --> 02:57:31,120
the brighter, vibrant glow right there. That is
currently the one, so I'm marking that as the Hex

2275
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:34,582
right there. There you go.

2276
02:57:34,582 --> 02:57:36,831
TALIESIN: Do you think they're really hard to hit
because they're small?

2277
02:57:36,831 --> 02:57:41,477
LAURA: Probably. I'm going to move over to my
left.

2278
02:57:41,477 --> 02:57:45,025
MATT: Okay. Here?

2279
02:57:45,025 --> 02:57:49,255
LAURA: Yeah. A little bit more. I want to line
them up in a cone, so if I can get as many in a

2280
02:57:49,255 --> 02:57:50,823
cone as I can.

2281
02:57:50,823 --> 02:58:03,462
MATT: Okay. Do we have the cone templates? Because
they're not by me right now.

2282
02:58:03,462 --> 02:58:07,996
LAURA: It's a 60-foot cone there that I have. It's
a big cone.

2283
02:58:07,996 --> 02:58:09,906
MATT: It's a very big cone.

2284
02:58:09,906 --> 02:58:11,590
LIAM: What about just a comb?

2285
02:58:11,590 --> 02:58:17,126
LAURA: I want to cast Hunter's Mark on the shiny
one that he hexed, as well.

2286
02:58:17,126 --> 02:58:18,989
MATT: Hunter's Mark on that one as well.

2287
02:58:18,989 --> 02:58:30,547
LAURA: Double. They're weak, you guys! Milk jug
rings, take them out.

2288
02:58:30,547 --> 02:58:43,805
MATT: Thank you, Zack. I appreciate that. So
60-foot cone. You can get four of them into it.

2289
02:58:43,805 --> 02:58:49,027
LAURA: That gets the mamba jamba? Okay, good.
That's what I want.

2290
02:58:49,027 --> 02:58:53,564
MARISHA: What we don't want to do is spread out
too much and get fucked.

2291
02:58:53,564 --> 02:59:00,943
LAURA: Conjure Barrage.

2292
02:59:00,943 --> 02:59:08,237
MATT: Conjure Barrage. All right. Dexterity saving
throw. All right.

2293
02:59:08,237 --> 02:59:11,568
LAURA: It's a 15 for me.

2294
02:59:11,568 --> 02:59:22,336
MATT: That's a success. Success. Success. 18, 19,
19. And 16. All succeed.

2295
02:59:22,336 --> 02:59:26,863
LAURA: So they take half. 3d8, halved.

2296
02:59:26,863 --> 02:59:30,775
MATT: So roll damage, halved. Grog's stone form
takes full damage.

2297
02:59:30,775 --> 02:59:46,827
LAURA: Oh. Sorry. 15, halved. Plus Hunter's Mark
damage on the--

2298
02:59:46,827 --> 02:59:49,080
MATT: On the one, so roll for that one.

2299
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:50,838
LAURA: I got three on that.

2300
02:59:50,838 --> 02:59:52,770
TALIESIN: Don't forget to Trinket.

2301
02:59:52,770 --> 02:59:57,502
LAURA: That's one action, isn't it?

2302
02:59:57,502 --> 02:59:59,231
TALIESIN: Is it an action?

2303
02:59:59,231 --> 03:00:01,103
MATT: It's an action to cast, yeah.

2304
03:00:01,103 --> 03:00:04,870
LAURA: So I can't use Trinket yet, because I
already did something.

2305
03:00:04,870 --> 03:00:12,756
MATT: All righty, so as everyone gathers up,
immediately as the fight begins you can see as Vex

2306
03:00:12,756 --> 03:00:20,367
puts a Hunter's Mark on the purple glowing pixie
and then pulls out an arrow, releases it, and then

2307
03:00:20,367 --> 03:00:25,370
it scatters into a blast of various shards of
sharpened wood, metal, and stone that goes

2308
03:00:25,370 --> 03:00:32,866
shooting into the nearby trees. You can see the
bark of the nearby tree trunks being covered with

2309
03:00:32,866 --> 03:00:37,689
various bits of ranger shrapnel as most of the
pixies try and avoid, but most getting blasted

2310
03:00:37,689 --> 03:00:39,300
with some semblance of impact.

2311
03:00:39,300 --> 03:00:41,775
That's going to end your turn, unless you want to
move some more.

2312
03:00:41,775 --> 03:00:44,202
LAURA: I want to duck behind that tree, like it's
going to do anything.

2313
03:00:44,202 --> 03:00:46,961
TRAVIS: How many points of damage was that?

2314
03:00:46,961 --> 03:00:50,671
MATT: To you? To your stone form? That was 15.

2315
03:00:50,671 --> 03:00:51,875
TRAVIS: 15.

2316
03:00:51,875 --> 03:00:57,030
MATT: From the blast of the impact you can see
parts of the stone get rough a little bit at

2317
03:00:57,030 --> 03:00:58,203
certain points.

2318
03:00:58,203 --> 03:01:01,141
TRAVIS: I can break.

2319
03:01:01,141 --> 03:01:02,424
LAURA: You can break.

2320
03:01:02,424 --> 03:01:06,162
MATT: Statues can break, and that's bad.

2321
03:01:06,162 --> 03:01:07,581
LAURA: That's super bad.

2322
03:01:07,581 --> 03:01:09,461
TRAVIS: Somebody lost an arm that way.

2323
03:01:09,461 --> 03:01:14,785
MATT: Do you want Trinket to move at all?

2324
03:01:14,785 --> 03:01:21,730
LAURA: Trinket runs and stands next to Keyleth.

2325
03:01:21,730 --> 03:01:27,552
MATT: All right. Got it. That brings us to Percy,
same turn.

2326
03:01:27,552 --> 03:01:39,362
TALIESIN: Taking a shot with Retort, with the
little pistol at the fucker I've marked. Dear god

2327
03:01:39,362 --> 03:01:40,904
almighty. 16 to hit?

2328
03:01:40,904 --> 03:01:46,142
MATT: 16 does not hit. As you try to shoot, this
tiny little glowing thing darts out of the way and

2329
03:01:46,142 --> 03:01:47,620
the bullet goes wide.

2330
03:01:47,620 --> 03:01:51,959
TALIESIN: Shoot again. That's better. 25.

2331
03:01:51,959 --> 03:01:53,039
MATT: That does hit.

2332
03:01:53,039 --> 03:02:00,305
TALIESIN: Okay. It has been way too long since
I've done this. It's making me a little nervous.

2333
03:02:00,305 --> 03:02:15,760
There we are. That's 11 points of piercing damage.
That's with three points of necro in there.

2334
03:02:15,760 --> 03:02:20,204
MATT: All right, so that's your second attack.
This time you do see as it moves out of the way

2335
03:02:20,204 --> 03:02:24,715
you compensate for it and fire, this time you see
the purple glow flicker as it takes an impact and

2336
03:02:24,715 --> 03:02:27,829
recaptures itself into its original position.

2337
03:02:27,829 --> 03:02:35,946
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take one more shot at
it with-- remind me if I can do this-- deadeye

2338
03:02:35,946 --> 03:02:37,389
with sharpshooter?

2339
03:02:37,389 --> 03:02:39,609
MATT: Deadeye sharpshooter? You can do that.

2340
03:02:39,609 --> 03:02:49,484
TALIESIN: All right, deadeye sharpshooter. Thank
god. This is just sucking. Oh my fucking god. I miss.

2341
03:02:49,484 --> 03:02:58,978
MATT: Okay. You don't misfire. All right, so after
the second shot hits, you fire, trying to

2342
03:02:58,978 --> 03:03:03,070
compensate a third time, but the pixie actually
stays in position and your fire goes wide once more.

2343
03:03:03,070 --> 03:03:10,388
TALIESIN: All right. Now I'm diving behind that
tree. Bottom right. Heading that way, yeah.

2344
03:03:10,388 --> 03:03:21,786
MATT: Cool, that ends your turn. The purple pixie
leader, the mystic you mentioned before, now

2345
03:03:21,786 --> 03:03:30,811
angrily comes fluttering forward, as you both have
vanished. Seeing this little circumstance, is

2346
03:03:30,811 --> 03:03:36,933
going to, from this position, look towards you at
the very front, Vax.

2347
03:03:36,933 --> 03:03:38,769
LIAM: Shit.

2348
03:03:38,769 --> 03:03:51,746
MATT: It begins reciting under its breath.

2349
03:03:51,746 --> 03:03:55,794
SAM: I'll do Counterspell at level six.

2350
03:03:55,794 --> 03:03:57,368
MARISHA: Oh snapricot.

2351
03:03:57,368 --> 03:03:59,934
TALIESIN: Did you just say "snapricot?"

2352
03:03:59,934 --> 03:04:07,103
MARISHA: I'm a fucking hipster.

2353
03:04:07,103 --> 03:04:18,451
TALIESIN: This is going so poorly.

2354
03:04:18,451 --> 03:04:24,699
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty.

2355
03:04:24,699 --> 03:04:33,525
MATT: As you cast your Counterspell, mark off your
6th-level spell. It finishes the incantation, as

2356
03:04:33,525 --> 03:04:38,941
it does, a bit of arcane energy sprays forth from
its fingertips and dissipates around it.

2357
03:04:38,941 --> 03:04:42,162
LIAM: Aw, that's sad.

2358
03:04:42,162 --> 03:04:45,345
MATT: Darts backwards.

2359
03:04:45,345 --> 03:04:48,471
LAURA: Out of camera view.

2360
03:04:48,471 --> 03:04:52,542
MATT: All right, Scanlan you're up.

2361
03:04:52,542 --> 03:05:06,217
SAM: They're so far, and I don't know what they
can do. Probably a lot. I'll step towards that

2362
03:05:06,217 --> 03:05:10,101
tree in front of me, in front of the bear and the
girl.

2363
03:05:10,101 --> 03:05:12,380
MATT: That's far as you can get.

2364
03:05:12,380 --> 03:05:22,395
SAM: That cluster of the pixies over there? I'll
see if I can get three of them in a Fireball.

2365
03:05:22,395 --> 03:05:23,944
MATT: Okay.

2366
03:05:23,944 --> 03:05:32,626
SAM: If I can, the leader and the ones closest to
the leader. But I don't know if I'm within range.

2367
03:05:32,626 --> 03:05:36,665
MATT: Okay, you just using a single charge for
it?

2368
03:05:36,665 --> 03:05:38,832
SAM: Oh yeah, I have lots of charges, don't I?

2369
03:05:38,832 --> 03:05:42,335
MATT: How many came back? You have to roll for the
last couple of times you've gotten a full rest.

2370
03:05:42,335 --> 03:05:43,947
SAM: I haven't used them in a long time.

2371
03:05:43,947 --> 03:05:45,155
MATT: Yeah that's true, actually.

2372
03:05:45,155 --> 03:05:52,392
SAM: I'll use two. A 4th-level spell, right?

2373
03:05:52,392 --> 03:05:53,521
MATT: 4th-level Fireball.

2374
03:05:53,521 --> 03:05:54,863
SAM: So it's 9d6.

2375
03:05:54,863 --> 03:05:56,197
MATT: Okay.

2376
03:05:56,197 --> 03:06:03,221
SAM: Range is 150 feet. Radius is 20 feet.

2377
03:06:03,221 --> 03:06:13,516
MATT: All right. As you pull out the wand and
release it, one of the nearby pixies-- It has no

2378
03:06:13,516 --> 03:06:14,799
effect.

2379
03:06:14,799 --> 03:06:15,666
TALIESIN: Assholes.

2380
03:06:15,666 --> 03:06:17,347
SAM: Wait, they can do that, too?

2381
03:06:17,347 --> 03:06:19,323
MATT: Oh my god, other people can counter.

2382
03:06:19,323 --> 03:06:30,394
LIAM: Passive-aggressive dungeon master! Oh,
that's so sad. Oh.

2383
03:06:30,394 --> 03:06:33,061
MATT: So the wand once again sputters out, as
well.

2384
03:06:33,061 --> 03:06:39,010
SAM: It's dead? Or it still might work after
that?

2385
03:06:39,010 --> 03:06:40,905
MATT: Well, it might still work after that.

2386
03:06:40,905 --> 03:06:48,539
SAM: That one use, okay. Can I move any more, or
am I all moved out?

2387
03:06:48,539 --> 03:06:49,832
MATT: That's the end of your movement.

2388
03:06:49,832 --> 03:06:59,352
SAM: I'll inspire Keyleth. I'll turn to her and
say: (singing) It's been a hard fey's night, and

2389
03:06:59,352 --> 03:07:06,939
you've got to unfreeze Grog. It's been a hard
fey's night, because we've been fighting like a dog.

2390
03:07:06,939 --> 03:07:10,552
MARISHA: Okay, I can do that.

2391
03:07:10,552 --> 03:07:15,014
MATT: That the end of Scanlan's turn? All right.
It's now the pixies' turn.

2392
03:07:15,014 --> 03:07:17,516
LIAM: Damn it, Bobby.

2393
03:07:17,516 --> 03:07:23,090
LAURA: They're all super magic, super-duper magic.

2394
03:07:23,090 --> 03:07:33,667
MATT: Actually, it's going to stay here, and
before it moves... that will be in range. If I could

2395
03:07:33,667 --> 03:07:38,981
have Keyleth make a wisdom saving throw.

2396
03:07:38,981 --> 03:07:40,554
MARISHA: This is my bailiwick, yo.

2397
03:07:40,554 --> 03:07:43,008
TALIESIN: You also have an inspiration die.

2398
03:07:43,008 --> 03:07:50,157
MARISHA: I have an inspiration die. Ooh, I don't
think I'll need it, though. 28.

2399
03:07:50,157 --> 03:07:53,676
MATT: 28, yeah. No effect on you whatsoever.

2400
03:07:53,676 --> 03:08:01,800
MARISHA: You even lift, bro? Come at me, bro. Got
the John Cena going on.

2401
03:08:01,800 --> 03:08:15,924
MATT: This one over here, as it flutters by after
seeing you attempt to cast the spell, Scanlan, I

2402
03:08:15,924 --> 03:08:17,539
need you to go ahead and make a 
wisdom saving throw.

2403
03:08:17,539 --> 03:08:21,701
SAM: Oh, boy. Advantage against magic.

2404
03:08:21,701 --> 03:08:25,039
MATT: That's magic in general?

2405
03:08:25,039 --> 03:08:30,818
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm looking at it. Yeah, advantage
versus magic on his saving throw.

2406
03:08:30,818 --> 03:08:32,350
MATT: From what, though?

2407
03:08:32,350 --> 03:08:35,104
SAM: I don't know, bard shit.

2408
03:08:35,104 --> 03:08:37,185
MARISHA: Is it because War Caster?

2409
03:08:37,185 --> 03:08:40,143
MATT: No, War Caster is advantage on concentration
checks to maintain.

2410
03:08:40,143 --> 03:08:42,267
SAM: No it's not War Caster. It's something else.

2411
03:08:42,267 --> 03:08:45,818
TALIESIN: It's on his sheet, which means he found
it somewhere.

2412
03:08:45,818 --> 03:08:48,522
MARISHA: And it's typed. It's typed up; it's not
written in.

2413
03:08:48,522 --> 03:08:53,978
SAM: I probably didn't get it anyway, actually.
Both rolls were shitty, and I only rolled a total

2414
03:08:53,978 --> 03:08:55,664
of five on the better one.

2415
03:08:55,664 --> 03:09:02,492
MATT: So as the pixie darts to the side, it
mutters something underneath it and raises its

2416
03:09:02,492 --> 03:09:08,067
hands up. Scanlan, all of a sudden your body
shimmers for a second, and you guys watch as the

2417
03:09:08,067 --> 03:09:09,962
already small gnome becomes even smaller.

2418
03:09:09,962 --> 03:09:11,242
LAURA: We're going to die.

2419
03:09:11,242 --> 03:09:12,392
MATT: He is now a badger.

2420
03:09:12,392 --> 03:09:15,512
SAM: I'm a what? I'm a badger?!

2421
03:09:15,512 --> 03:09:21,766
MATT: It then continues its movement over here by
the side of the tree.

2422
03:09:21,766 --> 03:09:27,140
SAM: Gnome Cunning, Matt.

2423
03:09:27,140 --> 03:09:28,706
TRAVIS: I tried to be diplomatic.

2424
03:09:28,706 --> 03:09:32,174
TALIESIN: A lot of good it did you.

2425
03:09:32,174 --> 03:09:33,534
LAURA: Why'd you do that?

2426
03:09:33,534 --> 03:09:35,086
LIAM: That's Scanlan's bag, man.

2427
03:09:35,086 --> 03:09:36,985
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I thought we were all-- never
mind.

2428
03:09:36,985 --> 03:09:41,053
TALIESIN: We would be getting our asses kicked by
a group of werewolves right now.

2429
03:09:41,053 --> 03:09:49,321
TRAVIS: People were preparing tea, you were being
cordial. I was trying to be disarming. Next time,

2430
03:09:49,321 --> 03:09:50,941
everything dies.

2431
03:09:50,941 --> 03:09:52,599
SAM: This is our punishment for--

2432
03:09:52,599 --> 03:09:55,591
TALIESIN: Trying to settle this amicably.

2433
03:09:55,591 --> 03:09:57,495
MATT: For intelligence, wisdom or charisma--

2434
03:09:57,495 --> 03:09:59,054
SAM: Yeah, that was a wisdom.

2435
03:09:59,054 --> 03:10:03,170
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine. Universal, so strength
saves, it doesn't help for any of those.

2436
03:10:03,170 --> 03:10:06,494
SAM: It's just saves against magic for those three
things.

2437
03:10:06,494 --> 03:10:18,204
MATT: This other one here, glancing over and
seeing you there, is going to look towards you. I

2438
03:10:18,204 --> 03:10:21,407
need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

2439
03:10:21,407 --> 03:10:26,027
LIAM: I've got advantage. Good, I got a 19.

2440
03:10:26,027 --> 03:10:27,847
MATT: 19. You have advantage from?

2441
03:10:27,847 --> 03:10:37,320
LIAM: Being a half-elf. Oh, it's not charm, is it?
Then the first one was shitty. Ten or 11,

2442
03:10:37,320 --> 03:10:39,160
somewhere around there.

2443
03:10:39,160 --> 03:10:41,309
MATT: You are a kitty cat.

2444
03:10:41,309 --> 03:10:46,561
LIAM: Can I use luck to take my second roll? I
have luck left?

2445
03:10:46,561 --> 03:10:48,163
MATT: You have one luck left?

2446
03:10:48,163 --> 03:10:50,119
LIAM: I have two luck left, after sleeping.

2447
03:10:50,119 --> 03:10:51,631
MATT: Yeah, technically.

2448
03:10:51,631 --> 03:10:57,224
LIAM: Okay, so the second was a 17. Plus two,
would've been a 19.

2449
03:10:57,224 --> 03:10:59,054
LAURA: So you're not a kitty cat?

2450
03:10:59,054 --> 03:11:01,336
LIAM: No, I really would like to be a kitty cat.

2451
03:11:01,336 --> 03:11:02,545
SAM: What happened?

2452
03:11:02,545 --> 03:11:04,671
LIAM: I asked if I could use one of my lucks
instead.

2453
03:11:04,671 --> 03:11:07,593
SAM: So wait, he's not a kitty cat?

2454
03:11:07,593 --> 03:11:10,913
LIAM: In my heart, I am a kitty cat.

2455
03:11:10,913 --> 03:11:16,317
LAURA: Grog is stone.

2456
03:11:16,317 --> 03:11:19,499
LIAM: There's worse things than being a kitten,
right?

2457
03:11:19,499 --> 03:11:26,569
MATT: This one over here leans towards you,
Keyleth. I need you to make another wisdom saving

2458
03:11:26,569 --> 03:11:27,594
throw.

2459
03:11:27,594 --> 03:11:30,060
MARISHA: Already? Come on. Come at me, bro.

2460
03:11:30,060 --> 03:11:34,925
LIAM: We should have all been pixies from the
beginning.

2461
03:11:34,925 --> 03:11:45,030
MARISHA: Okay, 27.

2462
03:11:45,030 --> 03:11:48,869
MATT: 27. You never roll low on those wisdom
saving throws. It's really frustrating.

2463
03:11:48,869 --> 03:11:52,067
MARISHA: Wise as fuck.

2464
03:11:52,067 --> 03:12:02,505
MATT: All righty, now comes to Vax.

2465
03:12:02,505 --> 03:12:11,151
LIAM: Click go the boots. I'm going to run 12
squares and squat down just north of Grog. I'm not

2466
03:12:11,151 --> 03:12:15,796
going to shit on you. I think I can make it all
the way around to the other side of Grog, and I'm

2467
03:12:15,796 --> 03:12:18,507
going to dagger, dagger, dagger at queen of the
pixies there.

2468
03:12:18,507 --> 03:12:20,236
MATT: Right there? Okay, go for it.

2469
03:12:20,236 --> 03:12:30,220
LIAM: Okay, first is shit, second is a natural 20.
Third is an 18.

2470
03:12:30,220 --> 03:12:32,004
MATT: Okay, second two hit.

2471
03:12:32,004 --> 03:12:40,231
LIAM: All right. Yeah, but it's not anything
fancy. That's the weakness of the rogue. Where's

2472
03:12:40,231 --> 03:12:45,662
my pyramid? There it is. So the first one which
was the critical is big 11 for the first one on a

2473
03:12:45,662 --> 03:12:55,070
critical. And the second one, I'll put poison on
it, as well. Seven for the damage, and it's a DC

2474
03:12:55,070 --> 03:12:57,236
of 15, for poison.

2475
03:12:57,236 --> 03:13:00,573
MATT: For poison, it does not succeed. It is
poisoned.

2476
03:13:00,573 --> 03:13:07,193
LIAM: That's 2d10. 14 with poison.

2477
03:13:07,193 --> 03:13:21,156
MATT: Nice. All right, so now the mystic, the
central pixie is fluttering, but it's not looking

2478
03:13:21,156 --> 03:13:29,363
amazing. All right, so that ends your turn? All
righty. That brings us to Keyleth.

2479
03:13:29,363 --> 03:13:32,857
SAM: Shouldn't have gone in that cave, man.

2480
03:13:32,857 --> 03:13:40,037
MARISHA: Can I dash and go a little bit further
and still do an action and lose a bonus action?

2481
03:13:40,037 --> 03:13:42,695
No, it's either like run or nothing?

2482
03:13:42,695 --> 03:13:49,088
MATT: A dash is an action, meaning you move and
then your dash, to move more, is your action.

2483
03:13:49,088 --> 03:13:56,339
MARISHA: Okay. Here's what I'm going to do, I'm
going to try and start making my way towards Grog,

2484
03:13:56,339 --> 03:13:58,316
I'm going to do the 30 feet towards him.

2485
03:13:58,316 --> 03:13:59,668
MATT: Okay.

2486
03:13:59,668 --> 03:14:05,439
MARISHA: Do I see the fairy leader?

2487
03:14:05,439 --> 03:14:09,400
MATT: You see her with a little bit of cover.

2488
03:14:09,400 --> 03:14:19,351
MARISHA: I'm going to blow my 6th-level spell. I'm
going to cast Sunbeam, and Sunbeam her in the face.

2489
03:14:19,351 --> 03:14:23,451
TALIESIN: Does that go through her? There's one on
the other side of her.

2490
03:14:23,451 --> 03:14:26,662
MARISHA: Oh! Does it go through to the one on the
other side behind her?

2491
03:14:26,662 --> 03:14:28,987
MATT: No, it would go in this direction. She's
right here.

2492
03:14:28,987 --> 03:14:40,541
MARISHA: I was looking at the red one, closer to
me. I don't have the fucking pointer!

2493
03:14:40,541 --> 03:14:43,418
SAM: That's Grog, the red thing near you is Grog.

2494
03:14:43,418 --> 03:14:54,010
MARISHA: No, not that fucking red-- this one. Yes,
that one. Jesus. And the one behind it.

2495
03:14:54,010 --> 03:15:00,683
MATT: All right, so. As you muster your Sunbeam,
the leader, who has not used her reaction yet, is

2496
03:15:00,683 --> 03:15:02,569
going to attempt to counter that.

2497
03:15:02,569 --> 03:15:03,746
MARISHA: No!

2498
03:15:03,746 --> 03:15:07,544
MATT: 6th-level, though, so it isn't an
auto-counter. She has to roll for it.

2499
03:15:07,544 --> 03:15:09,332
SAM: It's a contested thing.

2500
03:15:09,332 --> 03:15:18,404
MARISHA: Fucking bitch. I said <i>bitch</i>! I was
trying to be nice to you fairies!

2501
03:15:18,404 --> 03:15:25,038
MATT: Counterspell, so that DC is 16. That is a
19.

2502
03:15:25,038 --> 03:15:26,417
MARISHA: No, it's not!

2503
03:15:26,417 --> 03:15:28,030
MATT: It is 19, unfortunately.

2504
03:15:28,030 --> 03:15:30,418
MARISHA: Goddamn it, that was a 6th-level spell!

2505
03:15:30,418 --> 03:15:31,531
MATT: I know.

2506
03:15:31,531 --> 03:15:32,999
LIAM: The grace and poise of the Ashari.

2507
03:15:32,999 --> 03:15:44,025
MATT: As you muster your Sunbeam, the currently
wounded, poisoned-- let me check one thing real

2508
03:15:44,025 --> 03:15:48,665
fast. On attack rolls and ability checks, because
she's poisoned, she has disadvantage and has to

2509
03:15:48,665 --> 03:15:49,954
roll again.

2510
03:15:49,954 --> 03:15:51,141
MARISHA: That's right, she does!

2511
03:15:51,141 --> 03:15:52,404
MATT: A natural 20.

2512
03:15:52,404 --> 03:15:53,786
TRAVIS: No way.

2513
03:15:53,786 --> 03:16:01,805
MATT: Yeah. So it still counters it. So you go to
put your Sunbeam, the light begins to build up

2514
03:16:01,805 --> 03:16:06,205
into the middle of your grasp, as you're about to
unleash it and she darts up from behind the side

2515
03:16:06,205 --> 03:16:12,228
of the tree and unleashes a torrent of arcane
energy that feels like a gust of warm wind hits

2516
03:16:12,228 --> 03:16:15,047
and scatters the Sunbeam from your grasp, the
spell lost.

2517
03:16:15,047 --> 03:16:18,883
LIAM: Umbrasyl, in the can. Fairies, dead as
shit.

2518
03:16:18,883 --> 03:16:21,364
MARISHA: You guys are supposed to have good
parades.

2519
03:16:21,364 --> 03:16:30,224
MATT: All right, that's the end of your turn
Keyleth? All right. Garmelie turns invisible.

2520
03:16:30,224 --> 03:16:32,201
LAURA: Of course he does.

2521
03:16:32,201 --> 03:16:34,103
SAM: Don't they want to Counterspell that?

2522
03:16:34,103 --> 03:16:36,608
LAURA: Oh no, and he took out a tree while he was
at it!

2523
03:16:36,608 --> 03:16:43,877
MATT: Got to find a way to fix the glare on the
mat without the angle falling forward. All right,

2524
03:16:43,877 --> 03:16:46,960
top of the round, Percy and Vex, you guys are up.

2525
03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:48,480
LAURA: You go.

2526
03:16:48,480 --> 03:16:55,024
TALIESIN: Okay. From my vantage point I'm going to
sit down, take out Bad News, take another deadeye

2527
03:16:55,024 --> 03:16:58,693
sharpshooter with Bad News at the big fat fucker
by the tree.

2528
03:16:58,693 --> 03:17:00,807
MATT: As of right now, technically, you have no
sight on her.

2529
03:17:00,807 --> 03:17:01,975
TALIESIN: I don't?

2530
03:17:01,975 --> 03:17:04,899
MATT: You are way back there, and she is
completely behind the tree.

2531
03:17:04,899 --> 03:17:10,053
TALIESIN: Can I take a step out to the left? As
long as she has less than three-quarters cover,

2532
03:17:10,053 --> 03:17:11,162
I'm okay.

2533
03:17:11,162 --> 03:17:16,238
MATT: Right, so you would have to move-- she's
very tiny, and the tree that's probably five foot

2534
03:17:16,238 --> 03:17:23,156
or more thick. So based on her size, as part of
her advantage in using these trees is you'd have

2535
03:17:23,156 --> 03:17:25,656
to get over here before you can see her.

2536
03:17:25,656 --> 03:17:39,111
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'll move to my right a little
bit, then, and I will shoot that fucker that's

2537
03:17:39,111 --> 03:17:40,547
right in front of me.

2538
03:17:40,547 --> 03:17:42,318
MATT: All right. This one?

2539
03:17:42,318 --> 03:17:47,083
TALIESIN: Yep. Sharpshooter and with deadeye.

2540
03:17:47,083 --> 03:17:48,713
MATT: Go for it.

2541
03:17:48,713 --> 03:18:02,760
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20. That makes the grit
go away, anyway, so nice.

2542
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:06,757
TRAVIS: Fucking golden snitch.

2543
03:18:06,757 --> 03:18:14,835
TALIESIN: That actually wasn't the golden snitch.
I was just feeling like they had something on me.

2544
03:18:14,835 --> 03:18:18,052
Okay, so this is double the dice?

2545
03:18:18,052 --> 03:18:21,350
MATT: Yeah, you roll the dice and then double
that.

2546
03:18:21,350 --> 03:18:24,313
TALIESIN: Roll the dice, double it, and then I add
everything. Lordy, this is going to be

2547
03:18:24,313 --> 03:18:34,279
disintegration. Six, 12, 22, 28 points of damage.

2548
03:18:34,279 --> 03:18:35,828
MATT: 28 points of piercing damage?

2549
03:18:35,828 --> 03:18:37,018
TALIESIN: Yep.

2550
03:18:37,018 --> 03:18:40,777
MATT: To that one, all righty. That's adding the
sharpshooter?

2551
03:18:40,777 --> 03:18:46,222
TALIESIN: Yeah, I rolled really low.

2552
03:18:46,222 --> 03:18:52,466
MATT: Okay, gotcha. Okay, so you take the shot,
the blast echoing throughout the trees and the

2553
03:18:52,466 --> 03:18:58,170
treeline. You watch as the pixie takes the slug and
actually gets thrown to the ground and then

2554
03:18:58,170 --> 03:19:02,412
flutters back up, barely.

2555
03:19:02,412 --> 03:19:05,238
TALIESIN: Flutters back up, barely?

2556
03:19:05,238 --> 03:19:08,863
MATT: Yeah. It was undamaged before.

2557
03:19:08,863 --> 03:19:12,247
TALIESIN: Nothing fancy, just hitting it again.

2558
03:19:12,247 --> 03:19:13,609
MATT: All right.

2559
03:19:13,609 --> 03:19:16,937
TALIESIN: That's a 23.

2560
03:19:16,937 --> 03:19:18,950
MATT: That'll hit. Roll damage.

2561
03:19:18,950 --> 03:19:26,314
TALIESIN: That's better. 24 points of damage.

2562
03:19:26,314 --> 03:19:33,881
MATT: 24 points of damage. You hear this horrible,
high pitched (yelps) as the light is scattered by

2563
03:19:33,881 --> 03:19:39,129
a burst of what looks like a tiny blood spray, and
dust and smoke.

2564
03:19:39,129 --> 03:19:42,679
TALIESIN: I call out: One! And back up behind the
tree.

2565
03:19:42,679 --> 03:19:44,989
MARISHA: Out of how many?

2566
03:19:44,989 --> 03:19:49,022
MATT: All right, Vex.

2567
03:19:49,022 --> 03:19:58,791
LAURA: Okay. If I step out from behind the tree,
do I have a sight on the big one?

2568
03:19:58,791 --> 03:20:06,007
MATT: You do have a sight on the big one, yes.
It'll get cover bonuses. You'd have to get over here

2569
03:20:06,007 --> 03:20:07,209
to see it.

2570
03:20:07,209 --> 03:20:17,215
LAURA: Can I walk over there, then? Okay. I walk
to there. I want to use my Longbow of the Sky

2571
03:20:17,215 --> 03:20:19,203
Sentinel and attack it.

2572
03:20:19,203 --> 03:20:25,925
MATT: You initiate the bow, pull back the arrow,
and release as it splits into three different

2573
03:20:25,925 --> 03:20:27,134
arrows.

2574
03:20:27,134 --> 03:20:28,666
LAURA: Natural 20.

2575
03:20:28,666 --> 03:20:31,230
TRAVIS: I'm looking at it.

2576
03:20:31,230 --> 03:20:33,283
MATT: Jesus Christ. Okay.

2577
03:20:33,283 --> 03:20:37,120
SAM: Defying statistics, one roll at a time.

2578
03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:43,317
LAURA: 12 plus 12. 24.

2579
03:20:43,317 --> 03:20:50,009
MATT: Okay, 24. Wait, 12 plus 12, 24? All right, so
the second one hits.

2580
03:20:50,009 --> 03:20:52,121
LAURA: And then 22 on the third.

2581
03:20:52,121 --> 03:21:01,106
MATT: All three hit. Even with three-quarters
cover, the last one just barely hits. Roll damage

2582
03:21:01,106 --> 03:21:02,502
on all three.

2583
03:21:02,502 --> 03:21:04,717
TALIESIN: Kill them all.

2584
03:21:04,717 --> 03:21:13,912
LAURA: 20 on the first hit, no-- oh shit. You
double the dice? Six, that's 12.

2585
03:21:13,912 --> 03:21:21,344
LIAM: So add six to what you were saying,
originally. You said 20, so it'd be 26 if you're

2586
03:21:21,344 --> 03:21:22,516
doubling that die.

2587
03:21:22,516 --> 03:21:25,271
LAURA: 26 plus another five, so 31 on the first
hit.

2588
03:21:25,271 --> 03:21:26,716
MATT: 31 on the first hit, okay.

2589
03:21:26,716 --> 03:21:31,730
LAURA: 17 on the second.

2590
03:21:31,730 --> 03:21:33,119
MATT: All right.

2591
03:21:33,119 --> 03:21:41,014
LAURA: 17 plus five is 22 on the third.

2592
03:21:41,014 --> 03:21:49,332
MATT: You watch as the purple light gets stapled
to a tree in the back. You watch as the arrow hits

2593
03:21:49,332 --> 03:21:57,155
her and carries her and she tries to pull herself
off of the arrow as it's holding her against the

2594
03:21:57,155 --> 03:22:01,619
distant tree and then it goes limp against it and
the light slowly fades.

2595
03:22:01,619 --> 03:22:13,376
LAURA: Oh. So I shout out: Two! Your leader's
dead! You want to still fight us?

2596
03:22:13,376 --> 03:22:15,898
MATT: You've got two more squares of movement if
you want to use them.

2597
03:22:15,898 --> 03:22:19,842
LAURA: I move towards the tree.

2598
03:22:19,842 --> 03:22:21,456
MATT: This way or this way?

2599
03:22:21,456 --> 03:22:22,619
LAURA: That way.

2600
03:22:22,619 --> 03:22:27,318
MATT: This way. All righty, that ends your turn.
It would be her turn, but she just got stapled to

2601
03:22:27,318 --> 03:22:28,832
a tree. Scanlan, you're up.

2602
03:22:28,832 --> 03:22:33,938
TALIESIN: Build a dam. Sorry.

2603
03:22:33,938 --> 03:22:39,680
MATT: No, she didn't turn you into that. One of
the other ones did, I believe.

2604
03:22:39,680 --> 03:22:42,731
TALIESIN: Actually, the one I killed turned him--

2605
03:22:42,731 --> 03:22:49,664
MATT: You're right. Thank you. Scanlan has dropped
beaver form.

2606
03:22:49,664 --> 03:22:57,755
SAM: Oh my god, I was not expecting that, and
therefore have no idea what I'll do. So

2607
03:22:57,965 --> 03:22:59,833
there's pixies everywhere?

2608
03:22:59,833 --> 03:23:05,567
MATT: You can only really see one of them right
now. Yeah, this one's supposed to be there.

2609
03:23:05,567 --> 03:23:08,483
SAM: Which one?

2610
03:23:08,483 --> 03:23:10,117
MATT: You can see that one over there.

2611
03:23:10,117 --> 03:23:13,539
SAM: Is there one behind me? You can't see one
that I can see, actually. There's one around the tree.

2612
03:23:13,539 --> 03:23:15,984
MATT: Oh, sorry, two. You can see that one,
yeah.

2613
03:23:15,984 --> 03:23:18,553
MARISHA: I'll help him first, but yeah. I can do
that.

2614
03:23:18,553 --> 03:23:20,542
LIAM: They could possibly turn on us, though.

2615
03:23:20,542 --> 03:23:22,788
MATT: What're you doing, Scanlan?

2616
03:23:22,788 --> 03:23:27,940
SAM: I wasn't expecting to move! I can't see the
leader, right?

2617
03:23:27,940 --> 03:23:31,553
MATT: No, you <i>can</i> see the leader. She's fucking
dead, yo.

2618
03:23:31,553 --> 03:23:34,878
TALIESIN: She's pixie dust.

2619
03:23:34,878 --> 03:23:41,669
SAM: Shit! Not ready for this!

2620
03:23:41,669 --> 03:23:43,976
LIAM: Y'all ready for this?

2621
03:23:43,976 --> 03:23:53,068
SAM: Shit! Okay, I'll turn around, and let's just
hope that it works this time.

2622
03:23:53,068 --> 03:23:58,135
LAURA: Wow, this is the longest--

2623
03:23:58,135 --> 03:24:02,854
SAM: I don't know! I wasn't expecting to move! How
close am I to that one near the tree? Can I move

2624
03:24:02,854 --> 03:24:03,878
to her?

2625
03:24:03,878 --> 03:24:05,450
MATT: Here? This one or this one?

2626
03:24:05,450 --> 03:24:08,644
SAM: The closest one to me, and how close am I?

2627
03:24:08,644 --> 03:24:10,661
MATT: This one's closest to you, and it's 20 feet
from you.

2628
03:24:10,661 --> 03:24:18,701
SAM: Okay, I'm going to run to it, her, it,
whatever, because I don't think they can-- well,

2629
03:24:18,701 --> 03:24:21,539
maybe they can Counterspell this, but I'll do a
Thunderwave.

2630
03:24:21,539 --> 03:24:23,510
MATT: You do a Thunderwave?

2631
03:24:23,510 --> 03:24:25,244
SAM: Yeah. At level two.

2632
03:24:25,244 --> 03:24:29,220
MATT: That one is going to attempt to
Counterspell. Each one of them gets a

2633
03:24:29,220 --> 03:24:31,039
Counterspell; that one's not done it yet.

2634
03:24:31,039 --> 03:24:34,427
SAM: I do have a sword, shit, I'm the worst at
this!

2635
03:24:34,427 --> 03:24:39,924
MATT: So as you rush up and begin casting it sees
you rushing up and its eyes go wide for a second

2636
03:24:39,924 --> 03:24:45,758
as it instinctually puts its hands out and the
Thunderwave falls flat before you.

2637
03:24:45,758 --> 03:24:48,063
SAM: Shit, I'm the worst at this!

2638
03:24:48,063 --> 03:24:49,493
TALIESIN: Going to be a beaver again.

2639
03:24:49,493 --> 03:24:53,692
SAM: I am going to be a beaver again. That's it.
That's all I can do.

2640
03:24:53,692 --> 03:24:55,327
LAURA: I thought he was a honey badger.

2641
03:24:55,327 --> 03:24:58,653
MATT: Little angry badger.

2642
03:24:58,653 --> 03:25:09,642
SAM: Who's alive still? I'll inspire... shit, I'm
failing.

2643
03:25:09,642 --> 03:25:11,436
TALIESIN: I've never seen this before.

2644
03:25:11,436 --> 03:25:14,336
LAURA: He's broken. It's stealing all of his
energy!

2645
03:25:14,336 --> 03:25:15,774
TALIESIN: Inspire Vax.

2646
03:25:15,774 --> 03:25:17,243
SAM: I'll inspire Vax.

2647
03:25:17,243 --> 03:25:19,060
LIAM: Which one?

2648
03:25:19,060 --> 03:25:20,138
SAM: The girl!

2649
03:25:20,138 --> 03:25:21,237
TALIESIN: The guy!

2650
03:25:21,237 --> 03:25:23,168
SAM: I don't want to inspire him. I want to
inspire her.

2651
03:25:23,168 --> 03:25:24,716
MARISHA: That's Vex.

2652
03:25:24,716 --> 03:25:39,472
SAM: Vex, the girl. I'll say: (singing) Vex is natural, Vex
is fun! Vex is good when she's one-on-one.

2653
03:25:39,472 --> 03:25:45,404
LIAM: I was next to go, but that's still good.

2654
03:25:45,404 --> 03:25:50,090
SAM: I don't know. I was a badger! I don't know
what's been going on.

2655
03:25:50,090 --> 03:25:54,979
MATT: All right, that completes your turn. You
take your inspiration dice. It is now the pixies'

2656
03:25:54,979 --> 03:26:04,601
run. This one over here at this distance is
glancing over and saw its leader get thrashed off

2657
03:26:04,601 --> 03:26:12,640
to the side after having a series of daggers
thrown into it. You attempted to cast a giant beam

2658
03:26:12,640 --> 03:26:16,088
at that one in the distance as well, though, so
I'm going to say it's going to go for you.

2659
03:26:16,088 --> 03:26:19,601
Keyleth, I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

2660
03:26:19,601 --> 03:26:24,432
MARISHA: What? Why that one? I do still have my
inspiration.

2661
03:26:24,432 --> 03:26:28,450
TALIESIN: This ain't going to be no thing. It's
going to be great. It's going to be beautiful.

2662
03:26:28,450 --> 03:26:34,260
MARISHA: Natural 20! My voice just cracked, but
it's a natural 20.

2663
03:26:34,260 --> 03:26:38,829
TALIESIN: Isn't it hilarious that we all have work
tomorrow?

2664
03:26:38,829 --> 03:26:42,144
MARISHA: It is. No, I have a recording and an
audition tomorrow.

2665
03:26:42,144 --> 03:26:44,794
LIAM: It actually rolled when you moved the
paper.

2666
03:26:44,794 --> 03:26:46,285
LAURA: When you moved the paper, you rolled it.

2667
03:26:46,285 --> 03:26:47,570
MARISHA: No, I did, guys.

2668
03:26:47,570 --> 03:26:49,579
MATT: Roll it again.

2669
03:26:49,579 --> 03:26:50,801
LAURA: I'm sorry!

2670
03:26:50,801 --> 03:26:58,384
MARISHA: When I revealed it, it was a 20. That's
okay. I'm going to do inspiration though, just for

2671
03:26:58,384 --> 03:27:01,794
safe measure. That's good, so 20 total now.

2672
03:27:01,794 --> 03:27:03,292
MATT: 20 total, okay.

2673
03:27:03,292 --> 03:27:05,559
MARISHA: That's still exciting.

2674
03:27:05,559 --> 03:27:12,182
MATT: As it reaches out towards you, you feel your
physical body all of a sudden begins to tighten,

2675
03:27:12,182 --> 03:27:15,735
and you flex, and it regains its composure. No
effect.

2676
03:27:15,735 --> 03:27:19,754
MARISHA: And I just give her a-- (grunts) from the corner.

2677
03:27:19,754 --> 03:27:28,705
MATT: This one here is going to dart past, and as
it does, from tree to tree, I need you to make a

2678
03:27:28,705 --> 03:27:31,337
constitution saving throw.

2679
03:27:31,337 --> 03:27:37,203
LIAM: Straight up 15. Fuck it, I'll use luck. I've
got one more. Another 15.

2680
03:27:37,203 --> 03:27:44,537
MATT: 15 total? All right, you are currently
restrained as your body tightens up and you are

2681
03:27:44,537 --> 03:27:46,704
unable to move, shift, take any actions.

2682
03:27:46,704 --> 03:27:49,685
MARISHA: Did you go, too?

2683
03:27:49,685 --> 03:27:52,378
LIAM: I was about to, but not anymore.

2684
03:27:52,378 --> 03:27:55,433
MARISHA: Are you petrified, too?

2685
03:27:55,433 --> 03:27:56,807
LAURA: No, he's restrained.

2686
03:27:56,807 --> 03:28:00,484
MARISHA: Did he get turned to stone?

2687
03:28:00,484 --> 03:28:06,538
MATT: His body is beginning to turn to stone right
now. His muscles are beginning to tense up. As

2688
03:28:06,538 --> 03:28:15,926
this one darts past, it is going to attempt to-- I
need you to make another constitution saving

2689
03:28:15,926 --> 03:28:18,841
throw, Keyleth, as it watched it fade from the
last one.

2690
03:28:18,841 --> 03:28:25,438
MARISHA: I don't have any inspiration left.
Natural 20! This is a real one, this time! A real one!

2691
03:28:25,438 --> 03:28:27,680
TRAVIS: What is the deal?

2692
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:35,213
MATT: We're gone for one week. You guys can save
these for throughout the campaign. This is a pixie fight.

2693
03:28:35,213 --> 03:28:38,671
LAURA: It's a really powerful pixie fight.

2694
03:28:38,671 --> 03:28:44,370
MATT: These are nasty in their strengths. They're
not very strong in a lot of things, but the few

2695
03:28:44,370 --> 03:28:45,993
things they have are pretty good.

2696
03:28:45,993 --> 03:28:47,574
MARISHA: We know. We're still terrified.

2697
03:28:47,574 --> 03:28:54,010
MATT: Good. Well, you resist your second attempt
at being petrified.

2698
03:28:54,010 --> 03:28:58,738
LIAM: Am I restrained, or am I slowed?

2699
03:28:58,738 --> 03:29:03,424
MATT: You're restrained, which means you can't
move. The actual definition: attacks against you

2700
03:29:03,424 --> 03:29:06,774
have advantage. Your attacks have disadvantage.

2701
03:29:06,774 --> 03:29:08,853
LIAM: So I can still do stuff?

2702
03:29:08,853 --> 03:29:10,073
MATT: Correct.

2703
03:29:10,073 --> 03:29:17,372
LIAM: What do freezing up and haste do mixed
together? Anything? Cancel out?

2704
03:29:17,372 --> 03:29:21,126
MATT: It doesn't cancel out, it just means that
you have disadvantage on all of your attacks. Your

2705
03:29:21,126 --> 03:29:22,901
speed is zero; you can't move.

2706
03:29:22,901 --> 03:29:24,863
LIAM: Do I have a third attack?

2707
03:29:24,863 --> 03:29:26,507
MATT: You do have a third attack.

2708
03:29:26,507 --> 03:29:29,886
LIAM: Very confusing. Feywild, man.

2709
03:29:29,886 --> 03:29:31,300
SAM: You're fast and slow.

2710
03:29:31,300 --> 03:29:33,272
TALIESIN: Hot and cold.

2711
03:29:33,272 --> 03:29:42,983
MATT: This guy here-- I need you to make a
constitution saving throw as it peeks around the

2712
03:29:42,983 --> 03:29:45,171
tree from its current position.

2713
03:29:45,171 --> 03:29:49,539
LAURA: You get one, and <i>you</i> get one! And I'm
going to fail.

2714
03:29:49,539 --> 03:29:51,322
SAM: You've got some inspiration, lady.

2715
03:29:51,322 --> 03:29:56,311
LAURA: I got inspiration! 21!

2716
03:29:56,311 --> 03:29:58,443
MATT: 21. You resist the effect.

2717
03:29:58,443 --> 03:30:04,645
SAM: I was right to inspire her after all.
Someone's got to live!

2718
03:30:04,645 --> 03:30:09,569
TALIESIN: To tell the tale of the death and end of
Vox Machina to little people.

2719
03:30:09,569 --> 03:30:17,894
LAURA: How many more pixies are there?

2720
03:30:17,894 --> 03:30:20,640
MATT: That was the last one going on its turn.
Vax, you're up.

2721
03:30:20,640 --> 03:30:25,852
LIAM: I am going to dagger, dagger, dagger the
pixie in front of Scanlan, so I should get sneak

2722
03:30:25,852 --> 03:30:31,664
attack? I don't have advantage, so I don't get
sneak attack. That's three attacks. First one is

2723
03:30:31,664 --> 03:30:33,538
shit. 19?

2724
03:30:33,538 --> 03:30:35,628
MATT: With disadvantage? Hits.

2725
03:30:35,628 --> 03:30:38,391
LIAM: All right. Second one is 19.

2726
03:30:38,391 --> 03:30:39,542
MATT: Hits.

2727
03:30:39,542 --> 03:30:43,008
LIAM: The last one is a 15.

2728
03:30:43,008 --> 03:30:45,109
MATT: Misses. So two hit.

2729
03:30:45,109 --> 03:30:51,302
LIAM: Yeah, whatever. 11. And eight. 19 total.

2730
03:30:51,302 --> 03:30:54,766
LAURA: Can you poison damage it?

2731
03:30:54,766 --> 03:30:55,800
LIAM: No.

2732
03:30:55,800 --> 03:30:58,429
MATT: That one's looking pretty rough right now,
actually.

2733
03:30:58,429 --> 03:31:01,120
LIAM: And I say: (strained).

2734
03:31:01,120 --> 03:31:07,339
MATT: At the end of your turn, I need you to make
another constitution saving throw.

2735
03:31:07,339 --> 03:31:11,068
LAURA: Come on! Do you have any more luck?

2736
03:31:11,068 --> 03:31:13,701
LIAM: No, I used it all up. I didn't cross it off.
Two.

2737
03:31:13,701 --> 03:31:20,378
MATT: Vax now turns to a solid stone statue,
frozen in place. Two members of your party are now

2738
03:31:20,378 --> 03:31:30,810
turned to stone. All right, that brings us to
Keyleth's turn.

2739
03:31:30,810 --> 03:31:38,171
MARISHA: I'm going to continue my two steps
towards Grog, since he was my first destination,

2740
03:31:38,171 --> 03:31:46,768
and do Greater Restoration and unpetrify him.

2741
03:31:46,768 --> 03:31:48,790
MATT: Okay, what level is that spell?

2742
03:31:48,790 --> 03:31:51,758
MARISHA: Fucking 5th.

2743
03:31:51,758 --> 03:32:04,354
MATT: 5th-level? Only one of them has Counterspell
left, and it's going to attempt it, but since it

2744
03:32:04,354 --> 03:32:10,957
is at 5th-level, mark that off. It does still have
to roll against it. DC is ten plus five, so DC 15.

2745
03:32:10,957 --> 03:32:14,193
MARISHA: If they make this, it's bad news.

2746
03:32:14,193 --> 03:32:19,558
TRAVIS: They made it, didn't they?

2747
03:32:19,558 --> 03:32:22,786
MATT: Yeah. It's a 15 plus three, sorry.

2748
03:32:22,786 --> 03:32:30,946
MARISHA: They had to make 15? Not my spell save DC
or anything?

2749
03:32:30,946 --> 03:32:36,590
MATT: That's not how it works for Counterspell.
The good news is they're out of Counterspells.

2750
03:32:36,590 --> 03:32:41,707
MARISHA: Fucking fantastic now that I've burnt
through two of my top-level ones!

2751
03:32:41,707 --> 03:32:50,789
MATT: You reach forward and grab Grog. You see the
pulse of energy, and it dissipates. You look over

2752
03:32:50,789 --> 03:32:54,621
at the edge of the tree. You see one of the pixies
darting behind and disappears behind the trunk.

2753
03:32:54,621 --> 03:33:02,469
That ends your turn. Back to the top. Percy and
Vex.

2754
03:33:02,469 --> 03:33:05,856
TALIESIN: I'll go. Do you want to go first? I'll
go first.

2755
03:33:05,856 --> 03:33:11,842
MARISHA: Wait! I wanted to do a bonus action! I
did want to do something on a bonus action.

2756
03:33:11,842 --> 03:33:13,257
MATT: What do you want to do?

2757
03:33:13,257 --> 03:33:21,881
MARISHA: Can I Alter Self my throat and (howls)
give a wolf howl?

2758
03:33:21,881 --> 03:33:23,933
MATT: Sure, make a performance check.

2759
03:33:23,933 --> 03:33:26,539
SAM: Are you calling for the fucking werewolves?

2760
03:33:26,539 --> 03:33:32,339
MARISHA: Yes, I'm calling for the lycans. Ooh,
that's good. 23.

2761
03:33:32,339 --> 03:33:38,102
MATT: Good to know. You howl out into the woods.
Ends your turn. Percy, Vex.

2762
03:33:38,102 --> 03:33:45,138
TALIESIN: I'm going to flip around and take a shot
at that jerk right there with the Retort pistol,

2763
03:33:45,138 --> 03:33:53,650
not the Bad News. Standard shot. That's a 31 to
hit.

2764
03:33:53,650 --> 03:33:55,114
MATT: That hits.

2765
03:33:55,114 --> 03:34:02,577
TALIESIN: And that's 14 points of damage.

2766
03:34:02,577 --> 03:34:12,490
MATT: That one is spattered by the impact. You see
the chunks of it hit the tree behind, and you see

2767
03:34:12,490 --> 03:34:15,105
a wing right in front of you, Scanlan.

2768
03:34:15,105 --> 03:34:20,447
TALIESIN: I reload. I flip around the other side
of the tree.

2769
03:34:20,447 --> 03:34:23,251
MATT: Over to this side here?

2770
03:34:23,251 --> 03:34:26,670
TALIESIN: Over to this side so I can get a good
vantage point on that one that thinks it's hiding

2771
03:34:26,670 --> 03:34:31,196
right over there. I use my bonus action to cast
Hex on him.

2772
03:34:31,196 --> 03:34:32,886
MATT: To carry it over?

2773
03:34:32,886 --> 03:34:50,353
TALIESIN: Yep, to carry it over. And I take a shot
at him. That's 22 to hit?

2774
03:34:50,353 --> 03:34:52,318
MATT: 22 hits.

2775
03:34:52,318 --> 03:35:04,778
TALIESIN: Ten points of damage. Three necrotic.

2776
03:35:04,778 --> 03:35:13,979
MATT: It gets shot. The impact hits the tree next
to it, but it splinters and hits it, takes some

2777
03:35:13,979 --> 03:35:15,671
damage but not a whole lot.

2778
03:35:15,671 --> 03:35:21,529
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn an action surge and
take three more shots at it.

2779
03:35:21,529 --> 03:35:27,263
MATT: You can do that. You're ignoring the cover
because of your sharpshooter feat, so go for it.

2780
03:35:27,263 --> 03:35:34,738
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll a sharpshooter for
that one, as well, which is great because I rolled

2781
03:35:34,738 --> 03:35:47,173
a two and a natural 20. That's natural 20 with
sharpshooter. That also means that I lose that

2782
03:35:47,173 --> 03:36:00,520
grit. This is going to be great. That's great.
Ten, 20, 30, 36 points of damage.

2783
03:36:00,520 --> 03:36:03,250
LAURA: How many fairies are left?

2784
03:36:03,250 --> 03:36:05,337
MATT: You have currently two fairies left.

2785
03:36:05,337 --> 03:36:07,086
LAURA: I don't see them on the board from where I
am.

2786
03:36:07,086 --> 03:36:08,796
MATT: No, you don't see them. They're hidden.

2787
03:36:08,796 --> 03:36:14,056
TALIESIN: I'm taking two more steps, and I'm
getting that next fairy that thinks he can fucking

2788
03:36:14,056 --> 03:36:15,452
hide from me.

2789
03:36:15,452 --> 03:36:17,539
MATT: There are two behind this tree and one
behind this tree.

2790
03:36:17,539 --> 03:36:22,886
TALIESIN: I'm taking one more step out so I can
see him. Actually, I have pretty good sight, don't I?

2791
03:36:22,886 --> 03:36:25,854
MATT: From there, you can still see him.

2792
03:36:25,854 --> 03:36:30,206
TALIESIN: I've got two more shots. I'm going to do
the same thing with the sharpshooter deadeye combo.

2793
03:36:30,206 --> 03:36:44,367
That's right. I can't get Hex until next round,
though. 27 to hit.

2794
03:36:44,367 --> 03:36:46,546
MATT: Hits. Damage on that one?

2795
03:36:46,546 --> 03:36:49,729
TALIESIN: That's 16 points of damage.

2796
03:36:49,729 --> 03:36:57,784
MATT: The pixie gets hit and holds itself against
the tree. Its wings stop fluttering. It looks over

2797
03:36:57,784 --> 03:37:01,368
at where the impact came from and stares down at
you.

2798
03:37:01,368 --> 03:37:03,510
TALIESIN: Another shot at him. Same deal.

2799
03:37:03,510 --> 03:37:05,949
LAURA: I can spot him now because I can see where
Percy's shooting at, right?

2800
03:37:05,949 --> 03:37:07,248
MATT: Yeah.

2801
03:37:07,248 --> 03:37:10,886
TALIESIN: 28.

2802
03:37:10,886 --> 03:37:12,000
MATT: Hits.

2803
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:17,242
TALIESIN: Eight points of damage.

2804
03:37:17,242 --> 03:37:25,673
MATT: It gets another hit. This one impacts just
near it and clips one of its wings. It's still

2805
03:37:25,673 --> 03:37:27,286
holding in there.

2806
03:37:27,286 --> 03:37:29,266
TALIESIN: I dive back around the tree, and that's
the end of my turn.

2807
03:37:29,266 --> 03:37:31,712
LAURA: Where was it that he was shooting at?

2808
03:37:31,712 --> 03:37:33,387
MATT: Over this way.

2809
03:37:33,387 --> 03:37:35,343
LAURA: Can Trinket reach it?

2810
03:37:35,343 --> 03:37:39,425
MATT: Trinket can try. Trinket's not going to be
able to get there, though.

2811
03:37:39,425 --> 03:37:44,145
LAURA: Then I'm going to attack it. Can I attack
it from where I am?

2812
03:37:44,145 --> 03:37:47,163
MATT: You currently have no way of seeing it right
now unless you move far enough in that direction.

2813
03:37:47,163 --> 03:37:48,286
You may.

2814
03:37:48,286 --> 03:37:51,433
LAURA: I'm going to try to get into sight.

2815
03:37:51,433 --> 03:37:59,011
MATT: That's as far as you can get. I would say it
has three-quarters cover, so you can attack it,

2816
03:37:59,011 --> 03:38:01,633
but it gets plus five to its AC.

2817
03:38:01,633 --> 03:38:15,013
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to attack it. 23?

2818
03:38:15,013 --> 03:38:16,639
MATT: 23 hits.

2819
03:38:16,639 --> 03:38:22,911
LAURA: Then I'm going to attack it again with my
blazing bowstring. 26.

2820
03:38:22,911 --> 03:38:24,252
MATT: That hits.

2821
03:38:24,252 --> 03:38:28,745
LAURA: Can I move my Hunter's Mark over?

2822
03:38:28,745 --> 03:38:32,275
LIAM: Eye squint says no.

2823
03:38:32,275 --> 03:38:36,086
MATT: Sure. Because it's a bonus action, you
would've done it.

2824
03:38:36,086 --> 03:39:01,125
LAURA: Thanks, man! Okay, seven plus seven. 22 on
the first hit. 24 on the second hit.

2825
03:39:01,125 --> 03:39:08,529
MATT: (arrows loosed) Off to the side. One arrow
actually grabs it by the shoulder and hits it

2826
03:39:08,529 --> 03:39:12,988
against the tree there, and as it tries to pull
the arrow out, which is this giant shaft that's

2827
03:39:12,988 --> 03:39:17,940
shattered its shoulder entirely, it looks back at
you as you take its head off its shoulders.

2828
03:39:17,940 --> 03:39:21,711
LAURA: Teeny tiny little piece of shit!

2829
03:39:21,711 --> 03:39:24,551
TRAVIS: The cutest swear ever.

2830
03:39:24,551 --> 03:39:30,897
LAURA: I can't move anymore?

2831
03:39:30,897 --> 03:39:38,377
MATT: No, that's as far as you can move. Does that
end your turn? Scanlan, you're up.

2832
03:39:38,377 --> 03:39:40,093
SAM: Do I see any of them?

2833
03:39:40,093 --> 03:39:41,542
MATT: You do not.

2834
03:39:41,542 --> 03:39:52,695
SAM: Shit. I'm going to run as far as I can into
the open and see if I can see any of them, while

2835
03:39:52,695 --> 03:39:54,695
I'm yelling: Where are they?

2836
03:39:54,695 --> 03:39:58,663
MATT: You can just barely see two of them behind
that tree right there.

2837
03:39:58,663 --> 03:40:02,761
SAM: Behind that tree? You mean behind Grog and
stuff?

2838
03:40:02,761 --> 03:40:07,211
MATT: Behind Grog, Vax, Keyleth, and that
cluster.

2839
03:40:07,211 --> 03:40:11,819
SAM: Do I have a clear shot? Without killing my
friends?

2840
03:40:11,819 --> 03:40:13,454
MATT: Depends what you're doing.

2841
03:40:13,454 --> 03:40:14,935
SAM: With a Lightning Bolt.

2842
03:40:14,935 --> 03:40:24,712
MATT: It's probably going to hit Vax, but who
knows the effect lightning would have on stone?

2843
03:40:24,712 --> 03:40:39,516
SAM: Well, then I won't do that. I'll cast Bigby's
Hand at level seven and punch into that.

2844
03:40:39,516 --> 03:40:47,120
LIAM: Big swollen hand, fucking fat veins on the
back of the hand.

2845
03:40:47,120 --> 03:40:49,671
MARISHA: Have you been lifting, Bigby?

2846
03:40:49,671 --> 03:40:52,222
LAURA: You're looking good, Bigby.

2847
03:40:52,222 --> 03:40:55,660
MARISHA: You know those Hulk gloves?

2848
03:40:55,660 --> 03:41:04,813
MATT: At 7th-level. So it does an additional
4d-whatever it does. So which ability are you

2849
03:41:04,813 --> 03:41:06,062
using Bigby's Hand?

2850
03:41:06,062 --> 03:41:11,692
SAM: Just a big old punch. Pummeling hand.
Punching hand.

2851
03:41:11,692 --> 03:41:18,505
MATT: The clenched fist. Roll a melee spell attack
against its armor class. So roll a d20 and add

2852
03:41:18,505 --> 03:41:20,723
your spell attack bonus.

2853
03:41:20,723 --> 03:41:22,277
SAM: 25.

2854
03:41:22,277 --> 03:41:25,288
MATT: That hits. Roll 8d8 force damage.

2855
03:41:25,288 --> 03:41:28,104
SAM: 8d8? I don't even have any.

2856
03:41:28,104 --> 03:41:29,561
TALIESIN: Here's two more d8.

2857
03:41:29,561 --> 03:41:32,636
MATT: It's 4d8, but because you did it two levels
higher, it's 8d8.

2858
03:41:32,636 --> 03:41:35,092
TALIESIN: Roll them twice. Whoa!

2859
03:41:35,092 --> 03:41:42,331
MARISHA: Oh shit. You're a force to be reckoned
with. They were all above seven.

2860
03:41:42,331 --> 03:41:44,637
TALIESIN: You're going to leave an impression in
the tree.

2861
03:41:44,637 --> 03:41:49,275
SAM: 45.

2862
03:41:49,275 --> 03:41:56,076
MATT: Where once there was a pixie, there is a
brief spatter of reddish-pink mist, and nothing

2863
03:41:56,076 --> 03:42:05,649
thereafter. Bigby's Hand has sent it so hard to
its afterlife that there is a small black mark on

2864
03:42:05,649 --> 03:42:11,556
the tree nearby where it once was, just an echo of
its existence at one point.

2865
03:42:11,556 --> 03:42:14,722
TALIESIN: You just clapped a fairy to death.
That's actually literally the opposite.

2866
03:42:14,722 --> 03:42:16,677
MARISHA: High five! Aw.

2867
03:42:16,677 --> 03:42:20,230
SAM: Is that all the pixies?

2868
03:42:20,230 --> 03:42:21,733
TALIESIN: There's one left.

2869
03:42:21,733 --> 03:42:25,781
LAURA: We shouldn't kill it! See if it can
unfreeze our friends!

2870
03:42:25,781 --> 03:42:29,859
SAM: I got nothing left. That was my action and
bonus.

2871
03:42:29,859 --> 03:42:43,294
MATT: All right, end of Scanlan's turn. The pixie
then turns about and begins running. As it

2872
03:42:43,294 --> 03:42:52,300
disappears past the trees a little bit, you watch
as a large, dark form lands right in front of it.

2873
03:42:52,300 --> 03:43:02,501
It stops for a second, and two giant claws reach
down and grasp it in its hand, pick it up, and you

2874
03:43:02,501 --> 03:43:11,510
can see before you, Lord Ukurat is now clutching
this one pixie that was trying to escape. Looks

2875
03:43:11,510 --> 03:43:31,434
inside for a second. (chuckles) "Vengeance is
tasty." (chomps) "Not very filling." Stomps

2876
03:43:31,434 --> 03:43:33,220
forward.

2877
03:43:33,220 --> 03:43:36,761
LAURA: Be confident!

2878
03:43:36,761 --> 03:43:44,624
MATT: "So. You called."

2879
03:43:44,624 --> 03:43:52,774
SAM: We called because our plan worked perfectly,
and we were able to fulfill your deal to the

2880
03:43:52,774 --> 03:43:56,177
letter, as we had always intended.

2881
03:43:56,177 --> 03:43:58,672
MATT: Make a deception check.

2882
03:43:58,672 --> 03:44:01,111
MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan!

2883
03:44:01,111 --> 03:44:04,464
SAM: I think I'm still at disadvantage.

2884
03:44:04,464 --> 03:44:08,689
MATT: On ability checks, you are.

2885
03:44:08,689 --> 03:44:12,764
SAM: With disadvantage, it's a 30.

2886
03:44:12,764 --> 03:44:20,208
MATT: You can also add your own bardic inspiration
to your ability checks now because you're level

2887
03:44:20,208 --> 03:44:23,824
14. But if you feel pretty confident with it--

2888
03:44:23,824 --> 03:44:25,476
SAM: I'm okay with 30.

2889
03:44:25,476 --> 03:44:32,329
LAURA: Oh no! Should you add it? Add it!

2890
03:44:32,329 --> 03:44:33,695
MATT: It's too late.

2891
03:44:33,695 --> 03:44:35,667
SAM: We'll never know.

2892
03:44:35,667 --> 03:44:44,679
MATT: You're going to know pretty quick. As you
say this, he comes forward and gets really low to

2893
03:44:44,679 --> 03:44:50,689
the ground with his arms out at the sides, face right
up to you. He could snatch you up in one bite. He

2894
03:44:50,689 --> 03:45:12,382
goes, "Clever gnome." Stands back up. "So. One
pixie, two pixie, three, four. Where is their leader?"

2895
03:45:12,382 --> 03:45:18,973
TALIESIN: I walk over and scrape the tree.

2896
03:45:18,973 --> 03:45:36,976
MATT: Takes a look at it. (howls) All the rest of
the various members of his clan of the Fendirs

2897
03:45:36,976 --> 03:45:39,173
begin to arrive in the distance.

2898
03:45:39,173 --> 03:45:41,413
"Yes, my lord?"

2899
03:45:41,413 --> 03:45:54,803
"The mystic is dead. Wipe up the village. Come.
You have the rest of your deal to attend to."

2900
03:45:54,803 --> 03:45:59,316
Turns around and begins walking back toward the
city of the pixies.

2901
03:45:59,316 --> 03:46:04,687
LAURA: We have some friends that are stone right
now.

2902
03:46:04,687 --> 03:46:06,972
MATT: "Then bring them along!"

2903
03:46:06,972 --> 03:46:08,910
SAM: Keyleth, do you need help?

2904
03:46:08,910 --> 03:46:16,633
MARISHA: I take my last 5th-level spell to dump a
Greater Restoration into Grog to bring him back

2905
03:46:16,633 --> 03:46:18,687
from petrification.

2906
03:46:18,687 --> 03:46:21,115
SAM: You can't do it to two people at the same
time?

2907
03:46:21,115 --> 03:46:24,430
MARISHA: I can burn my 7th-level spell to bring
back Vax.

2908
03:46:24,430 --> 03:46:26,252
LAURA: Maybe you should do that.

2909
03:46:26,252 --> 03:46:35,300
MARISHA: I will burn my 7th-level spell to Greater
Restoration Vax and bring him back.

2910
03:46:35,300 --> 03:46:46,255
MATT: You come to consciousness, Grog, suddenly,
in a different space than you recall, a little

2911
03:46:46,255 --> 03:46:52,123
stiff in the joints, like you just had a really
bad night's sleep across a whole pallet of broken rock.

2912
03:46:52,123 --> 03:46:54,542
TRAVIS: Diplomacy really isn't that bad!

2913
03:46:54,542 --> 03:46:56,426
LAURA: It's not so bad. Good job, Grog.

2914
03:46:56,426 --> 03:46:58,730
TRAVIS: I'm going to throw my weapons in the
river. Hold on, I'll be right back.

2915
03:46:58,730 --> 03:47:07,119
MARISHA: You make a great parade balloon, by the
way. You look great.

2916
03:47:07,119 --> 03:47:08,872
TRAVIS: Why, thank you.

2917
03:47:08,872 --> 03:47:15,449
MATT: Vax, as you come to, the heat of the moment,
you catch your breath again, and feel that

2918
03:47:15,449 --> 03:47:16,839
achiness in your joints.

2919
03:47:16,839 --> 03:47:18,893
LIAM: I do, I literally do.

2920
03:47:18,893 --> 03:47:27,436
LAURA: Doesn't feel so good, does it? Hey,
remember when I was made into stone? We're

2921
03:47:27,436 --> 03:47:28,557
twinkies.

2922
03:47:28,557 --> 03:47:33,631
LIAM: Twinkies? I don't think that's the term
you're reaching for.

2923
03:47:33,631 --> 03:47:36,309
TRAVIS: All the wolves are back. What happened?

2924
03:47:36,309 --> 03:47:38,724
TALIESIN: We are going to finish off the fairies.

2925
03:47:38,724 --> 03:47:39,985
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

2926
03:47:39,985 --> 03:47:41,067
TALIESIN: Yes, really.

2927
03:47:41,067 --> 03:47:44,781
TRAVIS: Oh, so something happened, didn't it?

2928
03:47:44,781 --> 03:47:45,805
TALIESIN: It did.

2929
03:47:45,805 --> 03:47:47,466
SAM: Sorry, Grog.

2930
03:47:47,466 --> 03:47:51,547
TALIESIN: It was all your fault, really. You were
very helpful.

2931
03:47:51,547 --> 03:48:00,376
MARISHA: To be fair, I tried. Those fairies are
shifty little shits.

2932
03:48:00,376 --> 03:48:05,135
TRAVIS: Really? They fought hard? We're going to
kill more now?

2933
03:48:05,135 --> 03:48:06,218
SAM: Probably.

2934
03:48:06,218 --> 03:48:10,062
TRAVIS: Any tips? Advice?

2935
03:48:10,062 --> 03:48:12,196
TALIESIN: Hit hard, repeatedly.

2936
03:48:12,196 --> 03:48:15,500
SAM: Don't use any of your lower-level spells.

2937
03:48:15,500 --> 03:48:17,857
TRAVIS: Don't think that's a problem.

2938
03:48:17,857 --> 03:48:22,955
TALIESIN: No, you burned your lower-level spells.

2939
03:48:22,955 --> 03:48:26,358
MARISHA: I am burnt out on all my higher-level
spells.

2940
03:48:26,358 --> 03:48:28,389
TRAVIS: Are we cool with the wolves now?

2941
03:48:28,389 --> 03:48:30,706
TALIESIN: We're starting to be.

2942
03:48:30,706 --> 03:48:35,797
LAURA: We have to go finish what we started,
though. They want us to still desecrate the stones.

2943
03:48:35,797 --> 03:48:37,129
LIAM: Scanlan?

2944
03:48:37,129 --> 03:48:40,114
SAM: I'm ready. I've eaten a lot of things today.

2945
03:48:40,114 --> 03:48:48,816
MATT: Garmelie appears behind one of the trees.
"Is everything cool? Everything good?"

2946
03:48:48,816 --> 03:48:50,517
MARISHA: Oh my god, you're still here!

2947
03:48:50,517 --> 03:48:55,263
MATT: "Okay. No, I was-- got you guys' back."

2948
03:48:55,263 --> 03:49:00,665
LAURA: Did you draw a lot of the fight? I hope you
did, because we kicked some ass there.

2949
03:49:00,665 --> 03:49:08,801
MATT: He opens his sketch pad, and you can see
there's a bunch of hastily drawn sketches of Vax

2950
03:49:08,801 --> 03:49:14,081
turned to stone with his finger up his nose, Grog
in the ground with his stone thumb up his butt,

2951
03:49:14,081 --> 03:49:20,547
smiling with his other thumb up in the air like he
was. And the rest of you fumbling your attacks as

2952
03:49:20,547 --> 03:49:22,197
the pixies are laughing.

2953
03:49:22,197 --> 03:49:26,465
LAURA: Sweet. Nice. Very good. That tree just
moved.

2954
03:49:26,465 --> 03:49:28,440
TALIESIN: They do that here.

2955
03:49:28,440 --> 03:49:37,328
MATT: Welcome to the Feywild. So you guys make
your way nightward? Following the Fendirs?

2956
03:49:37,328 --> 03:49:39,174
TALIESIN: I guess it's the only way out of here.

2957
03:49:39,174 --> 03:49:46,142
MATT: You journey with them. They make a pretty
quick pace. Even at your fastest, you resort to

2958
03:49:46,142 --> 03:49:50,720
tracking them. They're moving with quite alacrity
and they know this forest really well. As you guys

2959
03:49:50,720 --> 03:49:59,494
begin to approach the outskirts of the little
grove where the Wishers existed, you see a heavy

2960
03:49:59,494 --> 03:50:08,630
battle has just begun to calm down. You see two
additional wolf statues now stand amongst the

2961
03:50:08,630 --> 03:50:17,377
area, but the abodes have been destroyed. You see
that the tiger has grabbed a pixie and tears it in

2962
03:50:17,377 --> 03:50:23,272
half. A couple others that have been darting
off in the distance, trying to escape, three more

2963
03:50:23,272 --> 03:50:27,117
of the wolves jump up into the trees, and you see
them jumping from branch to branch before their lights--

2964
03:50:27,117 --> 03:50:35,839
MARISHA: We tried. I didn't want this to happen.

2965
03:50:35,839 --> 03:50:37,646
TALIESIN: It's a violent world.

2966
03:50:37,646 --> 03:50:45,117
MATT: At this point, they all begin to slowly
gather again towards the center of the town, or

2967
03:50:45,117 --> 03:50:54,134
what used to be the pixie town. From the treetop,
(boom) Lord Ukurat lands next to the stone circle,

2968
03:50:54,134 --> 03:50:58,493
looks out towards you guys, even beyond the tree
line.

2969
03:50:58,493 --> 03:51:04,563
SAM: Grog, care to do the honors?

2970
03:51:04,563 --> 03:51:08,176
TRAVIS: Absolutely. I walk up to Lord Pup.

2971
03:51:08,176 --> 03:51:12,620
LIAM: I'm going to follow close behind Grog.

2972
03:51:12,620 --> 03:51:19,107
MATT: All the rest of the Fendirs, which are now a
few more in number than you initially met before.

2973
03:51:19,107 --> 03:51:23,150
We have two more that have turned to stone, so
there's now five total that are stone in the

2974
03:51:23,150 --> 03:51:28,014
center of this village, but looks to be about nine
of them now gathered up centrally to this space,

2975
03:51:28,014 --> 03:51:34,490
Lord Ukurat in the center. They're beginning to
follow in around you guys, keeping a perimeter.

2976
03:51:34,490 --> 03:51:48,905
Ukurat looks down at you as you approach. "So. Honor
comes at the end of the journey. We made a pact,

2977
03:51:48,905 --> 03:52:02,056
"and you completed your end. We complete ours. You
are free to pass through this forest." As Lord

2978
03:52:02,056 --> 03:52:06,863
Ukurat reaches down and grabs two of the stones,
you can see as his fingers grab them, they're

2979
03:52:06,863 --> 03:52:12,570
burning his palms, singeing. There's a bunch of
energy pushing back on him as his fur is blown and

2980
03:52:12,570 --> 03:52:18,608
there's a bright light emanating from the center
of the circle. Wrestles them forth from the

2981
03:52:18,608 --> 03:52:25,447
ground. As he does, there's a crack of thunder
that cascades throughout the center of the forest.

2982
03:52:25,447 --> 03:52:37,534
All of you feel the impact. The stone circle, the
glowing quartz now dims and goes cold. The center

2983
03:52:37,534 --> 03:52:45,008
where it used to be vibrant grass slowly turns to
a dull gray and withers between the stones. Throws

2984
03:52:45,008 --> 03:53:02,110
them to the ground. "Now, we are all free. You say
you travel duskward to the corrupted tree, yes?"

2985
03:53:02,110 --> 03:53:03,751
LAURA: Yes.

2986
03:53:03,751 --> 03:53:18,741
MATT: "I will follow as my people find a new home
for tonight. Should you need my help, just call,

2987
03:53:18,741 --> 03:53:21,977
"and I will be at your back."

2988
03:53:21,977 --> 03:53:25,628
LAURA: You are a powerful ally.

2989
03:53:25,628 --> 03:53:40,825
MATT: "As are you. Brethren, go. Spread. Find a
home again. I will return to you once this debt is

2990
03:53:40,825 --> 03:53:49,717
"paid. Now, I'll be watching." He leaps into the
treetops as the rest of the wolves begin to back

2991
03:53:49,717 --> 03:53:52,217
away from you and vanish into the shadows of the
forest.

2992
03:53:52,217 --> 03:53:58,868
LAURA: Is there anything around that looks good to
take?

2993
03:53:58,868 --> 03:54:00,583
SAM: Should we loot the mini city?

2994
03:54:00,583 --> 03:54:05,462
TALIESIN: I am abso-fucking-lutely looting this
city. Are you mad?

2995
03:54:05,462 --> 03:54:08,219
SAM: They're tiny thimbles full of nothing!

2996
03:54:08,219 --> 03:54:13,310
TALIESIN: I have a dollhouse at home! There are
things that are necessary! Jesus.

2997
03:54:13,310 --> 03:54:20,880
MATT: You are welcome to make some investigation
checks to scour through the remains of this pixie

2998
03:54:20,880 --> 03:54:22,071
village.

2999
03:54:22,071 --> 03:54:24,970
SAM: 17 for me.

3000
03:54:24,970 --> 03:54:26,144
LAURA: 23.

3001
03:54:26,144 --> 03:54:29,193
MATT: 23. What was it again, sorry?

3002
03:54:29,193 --> 03:54:30,307
TALIESIN: 13.

3003
03:54:30,307 --> 03:54:33,300
MATT: The rest of you guys keeping back on this?

3004
03:54:33,300 --> 03:54:39,010
TALIESIN: I'm taking the crystals, too. The dead
crystals.

3005
03:54:39,010 --> 03:54:45,767
MATT: You take the dead crystals, and the rest of
them lift up like any other crystals. They're

3006
03:54:45,767 --> 03:54:52,001
lighter than you expected. They seem almost frail,
like a volcanic rock in lightness and brittleness,

3007
03:54:52,001 --> 03:54:57,531
but more dense. You take those, keep them to
yourself.

3008
03:54:57,531 --> 03:55:07,306
You guys look about, and most any pixie furniture
has been destroyed. In searching through, you do

3009
03:55:07,306 --> 03:55:17,549
find in some of the homes a number of
well-polished gems. You find two sapphires that

3010
03:55:17,549 --> 03:55:22,156
are worth, after looking over them for a bit, in
your experience with gems, about 200 gold apiece.

3011
03:55:22,156 --> 03:55:31,293
You find one cracked diamond. It was very well-cut
at one time. As such, what would have been worth

3012
03:55:31,293 --> 03:55:40,676
thousands of gold now is maybe close to a thousand
gold at most. It can maybe be repaired or brought

3013
03:55:40,676 --> 03:55:43,160
to somebody who can fix it up. It might be worth
more.

3014
03:55:43,160 --> 03:55:50,115
You also find what looks to be a really
intricately carved onyx statue of a dog, about

3015
03:55:50,115 --> 03:56:01,597
that big. It's really well-carved. Other than
that, most everything else is just inconsequential

3016
03:56:01,597 --> 03:56:06,033
decorations that wouldn't be much help to you, as
they were smaller people.

3017
03:56:06,033 --> 03:56:11,867
TALIESIN: I say we get to the edge, out of this
forest, and then maybe call it a night.

3018
03:56:11,867 --> 03:56:24,529
MARISHA: I'm a bit tapped on my higher-level
energy, but can I maybe take a minute to ritual

3019
03:56:24,529 --> 03:56:31,080
cast Greater Restoration on the two new statues of
the lycanthropes?

3020
03:56:31,080 --> 03:56:35,212
MATT: Is that a ritual? I don't believe it can be
cast as a ritual, can it?

3021
03:56:35,212 --> 03:56:37,739
MARISHA: Greater Restoration? I can't take my time
with it?

3022
03:56:37,739 --> 03:56:40,080
MATT: You would have to stay here the night and do
it again.

3023
03:56:40,080 --> 03:56:43,292
MARISHA: They'll figure it out.

3024
03:56:43,292 --> 03:56:47,004
TRAVIS: The gray ground that's been burned, is it
just...

3025
03:56:47,004 --> 03:56:48,870
MATT: Just where the circle was.

3026
03:56:48,870 --> 03:56:50,161
TRAVIS: Not everything else?

3027
03:56:50,161 --> 03:56:51,228
MATT: No. Just the circle.

3028
03:56:51,228 --> 03:56:54,995
TRAVIS: I feel like we just killed FernGully.

3029
03:56:54,995 --> 03:56:57,559
LAURA: Yeah, I know. We did kill FernGully.

3030
03:56:57,559 --> 03:57:05,880
LIAM: Yeah, but if they had any good in their
heart, why would they be trapping travelers of any kind?

3031
03:57:05,880 --> 03:57:09,166
LAURA: They weren't trapping travelers of any
kind, they were trapping the lycans.

3032
03:57:09,166 --> 03:57:10,817
TALIESIN: Then they trapped us!

3033
03:57:10,817 --> 03:57:12,307
LAURA: Yeah, but then they let us out.

3034
03:57:12,307 --> 03:57:14,096
TALIESIN: They didn't really let us out.

3035
03:57:14,096 --> 03:57:18,929
SAM: Everyone was bad, including us, and we lived.
That's it.

3036
03:57:18,929 --> 03:57:25,811
MATT: You guys begin trekking duskward again,
finally getting to the outskirts of the city. As

3037
03:57:25,811 --> 03:57:35,490
you reach the outer perimeter of the forest, you
reach up and you find no barrier there. It has

3038
03:57:35,490 --> 03:57:45,412
been dispelled, and you guys step forth into the
field, hearing now as you travel further northward, duskward,

3039
03:57:45,412 --> 03:57:54,217
the gentle sounds of rushing water begin to
approach. Garmelie glances past you and goes,

3040
03:57:54,217 --> 03:57:57,754
"Well, good news. We've reached the Gilded Run."

3041
03:57:57,754 --> 03:57:59,714
TRAVIS: Oh, we're here!

3042
03:57:59,714 --> 03:58:02,568
MATT: "Bad news, we've reached the Gilded Run."

3043
03:58:02,568 --> 03:58:05,111
LAURA: Let's sleep in the mansion tonight.

3044
03:58:05,111 --> 03:58:06,852
MARISHA: I'm pretty tapped out.

3045
03:58:06,852 --> 03:58:08,603
SAM: I would love to.

3046
03:58:08,603 --> 03:58:10,075
LAURA: But you can't?

3047
03:58:10,075 --> 03:58:15,167
SAM: I used my 7th-level spell to kill a pixie.

3048
03:58:15,167 --> 03:58:17,154
TRAVIS: Why is reaching the Gilded Run a bad
thing?

3049
03:58:17,154 --> 03:58:24,751
MATT: "It's a difficult thing to pass. Those
rivers are quite expedient."

3050
03:58:24,751 --> 03:58:26,874
TRAVIS: Like rapids?

3051
03:58:26,874 --> 03:58:27,938
MATT: "Yeah."

3052
03:58:27,938 --> 03:58:34,300
MARISHA: If we sleep, I can come prepared with
lots of Control Water spells.

3053
03:58:34,300 --> 03:58:41,923
SAM: Maybe we can sleep in the treetops, where
Lord Ukurat sleeps.

3054
03:58:41,923 --> 03:58:45,331
LAURA: Yeah, let's sleep up in the trees tonight,
before we make our way into this area.

3055
03:58:45,331 --> 03:58:51,050
MATT: You guys head back into the Moonbrush. You
ascend up into the canopy and prepare yourselves,

3056
03:58:51,050 --> 03:58:56,659
finding an area of branches that can be cleared to
give yourself a comfortable space to stay for the

3057
03:58:56,659 --> 03:58:57,544
evening.

3058
03:58:57,544 --> 03:59:02,410
LAURA: You realize it's only been an hour since we
slept last, but it's all nighty.

3059
03:59:02,410 --> 03:59:08,549
MATT: Well, travel to and from the center of the
forest has taken a few hours, so it's been a while.

3060
03:59:08,549 --> 03:59:12,342
TALIESIN: We're tapped. We had a long day.

3061
03:59:12,342 --> 03:59:18,670
MARISHA: It wouldn't be that bad if I didn't get
Counterspelled twice. Fucking fairies.

3062
03:59:18,670 --> 03:59:20,815
MATT: Hey, man. It's what they do.

3063
03:59:20,815 --> 03:59:23,227
TRAVIS: Must've been a cool fight.

3064
03:59:23,227 --> 03:59:29,753
MATT: As you guys make yourselves restful and set,
you all begin to fall asleep to the distant sound

3065
03:59:29,753 --> 03:59:38,388
of howling as it gets more and more faint. The
sleep takes you to prepare for the next run of

3066
03:59:38,388 --> 03:59:44,573
your journey, next week in Indianapolis! We'll see
you guys at GenCon for the next episode as you

3067
03:59:44,573 --> 03:59:49,202
guys approach the Gilded Run and the Shademirk
itself, seemingly getting closer to the end of

3068
03:59:49,202 --> 03:59:51,599
your journey in the Feywild. We'll see how this
plays out.

3069
03:59:51,599 --> 03:59:54,880
TRAVIS: With werewolves in tow.

3070
03:59:54,880 --> 03:59:58,192
MATT: A werewolf in tow, that you know of.

3071
03:59:58,192 --> 03:59:59,649
TRAVIS: Not the rest of them?

3072
03:59:59,649 --> 04:00:02,595
LAURA: No, but Lord Big Badass is going to help
us.

3073
04:00:02,595 --> 04:00:03,972
TRAVIS: He's going to steal our shit.

3074
04:00:03,972 --> 04:00:05,186
LAURA: He might try to.

3075
04:00:05,186 --> 04:00:07,075
SAM: We'll give him Garmelie if we have to.

3076
04:00:07,075 --> 04:00:10,783
MARISHA: Yeah, at the break you were talking about
how badly you wanted to kill things.

3077
04:00:10,783 --> 04:00:12,679
LAURA: And you didn't get to do <i>any</i> of it!

3078
04:00:12,679 --> 04:00:16,625
TRAVIS: I was trying to be diplomatic, all right?
I checked off the box!

3079
04:00:16,625 --> 04:00:18,180
MARISHA: You did, you tried.

3080
04:00:18,180 --> 04:00:19,833
TRAVIS: Next time, napalm.

3081
04:00:19,833 --> 04:00:28,757
MATT: It was an unfortunate circumstance. The
wound above the eye, the lack of decent diplomacy,

3082
04:00:28,757 --> 04:00:32,268
their fear of the spread of lycanthropy--

3083
04:00:32,268 --> 04:00:36,386
TRAVIS: I even gave willingly.

3084
04:00:36,386 --> 04:00:39,626
TALIESIN: You did. You've grown.

3085
04:00:39,626 --> 04:00:41,560
MARISHA: It was a good moment for Grog.

3086
04:00:41,560 --> 04:00:46,609
LAURA: Hey, we're going to have werewolves
everywhere now, guys. We just let it out.

3087
04:00:46,609 --> 04:00:48,710
MARISHA: Yeah, we let the disease spread?

3088
04:00:48,710 --> 04:00:50,274
TRAVIS: Not yet we haven't.

3089
04:00:50,274 --> 04:00:55,540
MARISHA: You want to be a werewolf so bad. You're
just saying that because you want to be one so bad.

3090
04:00:55,540 --> 04:01:03,301
MATT: Thank you so much! We'll see you guys at
GenCon next Saturday at 8pm Eastern, that would be

3091
04:01:03,301 --> 04:01:10,193
5pm Pacific time, streaming next Saturday.

3092
04:01:10,193 --> 04:01:13,001
LAURA: Thank you, Backblaze!

3093
04:01:13,001 --> 04:01:14,372
SAM: No show Thursday!

3094
04:01:14,372 --> 04:01:16,139
MATT: Just the Saturday show.

3095
04:01:16,139 --> 04:01:17,464
MARISHA: Saturday.

3096
04:01:17,464 --> 04:01:21,777
MATT: So guys, have a good night, rest well, and
we'll see you next week.
