NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.302
MATT: Hello. My name is Matthew Mercer. 
I'm a voice actor and the Dungeon Master on

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:06.763
Critical Role here on Geek &amp; Sundry, 
and today's topic is the joyous,

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:11.263
wondrous event of player character death.

00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:16.812
[music]

00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:22.194
In running most RPGs there is the inevitable 
scenario of a PC falling in battle without

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:25.771
means of recovery. Months or years of 
character development and investment

00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:30.543
gone in a flash. Now how do you guide your 
players through such an intense scenario

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:34.604
and move forward in a positive way. 
I mean it's the danger you must maintain

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:37.904
in your game if it's to hold any real weight 
and stakes for the players.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:43.023
In the earlier levels it can really be a constant, 
real threat. It can be a emotional and difficult

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:47.409
scenario to see through as a GM so 
be ready and here are some ways to hopefully

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.362
make it easier for the player to digest, 
and make it a real powerful and memorable

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:53.622
moment for the game as a whole.

00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:56.862 line:1
First, let the players know that when you 
begin the campaign that player death is

00:00:56.862 --> 00:01:01.872 line:1
indeed a real possibility. Make sure they understand 
that fact early in so as you progress it

00:01:01.872 --> 00:01:04.742
doesn't catch them off guard when it 
does happen for the first time.

00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:09.032
At least, as off guard as it would. 
It's going to catch you off guard regardless,

00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:14.753
but, you know what I mean. Now when 
the moment does happen, don't gloss over it.

00:01:14.753 --> 00:01:19.540 line:1
Explain the death as cinematically as you can, 
letting the epic final moments ring out in the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.513 line:1
party is a powerful if incredibly sad, moment. 
Now, outside of a non-recoverable corpse,

00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:31.463
or a death that destroys the body instantly, 
consider letting the player get a few last words

00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:37.728 line:1
out as a battle cry or inspiration to their friends 
to carry on that will allow a very clear crystal

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:42.167 line:1
moment for that character to really be remembered 
by the rest of the players and the PCs for that matter.

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:48.054
If there is no resurrection recourse for the PCs 
give some time to let the group mourn in game,

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:53.953
in character and perhaps, if in game time allows, 
hold a role playing wake.

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:58.642
Try your best to play up the warriors wake 
with celebration of their life over hanging on

00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:02.133
to the sadness of death instead. 
It really helps the players kind of digest

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:07.372
in a positive light and tell rousing stories 
of great memories they had with their party member

00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:13.482
and kind of just overall gives a better and more 
healing spin on the whole experience.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:18.095
Also, let the player of the deceased character 
write an epilogue for their tale.

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:22.352
Perhaps as a way to get down those unspoken words 
they never really got a chance to say

00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:27.442
before their untimely end came. 
After the session is done in which the character falls,

00:02:27.442 --> 00:02:32.883
maybe shortly in the future, depending on gauging it, 
go out with the players to get drinks or a fine meal

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:37.348 line:1
to celebrate the memory of the character as
just a group of friends sitting in a restaurant somewhere.

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:41.572 line:1
It really also helps to get rid of all the tension 
of the moment and let you guys remind yourself

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:43.992
that it's just a game and you're all friends 
still having a good time even when

00:02:43.992 --> 00:02:47.661
the sad moments happen. As soon as it feels 
comfortable after the session, go ahead and

00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:50.951
speak directly with the player about the excitement 
of getting to create a brand new character

00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:55.413
and all the endless possibilities for 
trying out new skills and abilities.

00:02:55.413 --> 00:02:59.753
Brainstorm new character story ideas and how 
they would fit into the current campaign.

00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:03.723
If they're still really attached to their dead 
characters, perhaps you could brainstorm

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:07.612
a way to have the new character involved in the 
backstory of the deceased PC so that a

00:03:07.612 --> 00:03:12.502
spiritual successor is found and it carries the torch. 
You can discuss with the other players

00:03:12.502 --> 00:03:16.192
ways to keep the memory of the fallen 
in the game as you go on. They could craft

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:20.641
bracelets of remembrance they refer to in 
the future during moments of tension.

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:24.915
Perhaps they could name their new keep after 
the dead. They could use their name as a war cry

00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:29.363
in future struggles. Things like that. Ways to keep 
the memory of that character alive as they play on.

00:03:29.363 --> 00:03:34.893
There is sometimes difficulty in incorporating 
a new character into a long-running adventuring party.

00:03:34.893 --> 00:03:38.964
Filling a hole in a long-established rapport 
can be strange and finding a way for you,

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:45.182
the GM, to bring them in without feeling too forced 
can really be an interesting challenge. Trust me.

00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:50.833 line:1
It sucks. I recommend finding a way to tie 
them to the main narrative threads or the

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:56.522 line:1
current overarching quest. Talk with the player about this, 
and talk with your other PCs about being receptive,

00:03:56.522 --> 00:04:02.522 line:1
as much as their PCs can be, to a new ally. 
The new PC can be related to, or a friend or ally,

00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:07.863
to the deceased PC, wishing to avenge them
and see their goal to completion in their honor.

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:12.733
The new PC could even be an off-screen NPC 
from another player's character's backstory,

NOTE Paragraph

00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:16.243
with that player's permission of course, 
already tying them to the party and giving

00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:20.761
them inherent stakes in the story. The new PC 
could have strongly aligned goals with the party

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.312
and having heard of their proven skills and renown 
wish to ensure the best means of

00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:29.393
success for both of them. They could even arrive 
to the party with extremely essential information,

00:04:29.393 --> 00:04:34.133
or an essential artifact of the main quest, 
quickly tying them to the fate of the adventuring party.

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:38.503
The new PC could have a long history with 
the main antagonist - wishing to tear them down

00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:43.863
for personal reasons, and they seek like-minded allies 
to achieve this goal. The new PC could even pick up

00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:48.917
the reins of a non-essential NPC you introduced 
that the player took a shine to and bring them to

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:53.043
the forefront of the story as a PC now. 
You inform the player of what you had developed

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:58.114
regarding that NPC and their story and 
let them take that and run with it for the future.

00:04:58.114 --> 00:05:02.322
These are all options and ideas of ways to do it, 
and there are many others that you may want

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:06.143
to research on your own, but I hope that at least 
these will be somewhat helpful in tackling

00:05:06.143 --> 00:05:08.882
this somewhat difficult circumstance in your game.

00:05:08.882 --> 00:05:11.656
