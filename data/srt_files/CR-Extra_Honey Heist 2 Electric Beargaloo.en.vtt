NOTE Paragraph

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.336
MARISHA: Hello everyone, and welcome to our very
special one-shot edition where we are paying up on

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:19.107
our good word for you guys that donated so much to
our 826LA Charity Drive a few months ago, top of

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:26.951
the year, whenever that was. Anyway, here it is!
Welcome to the game.

00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:28.177
SAM: (whispering) Say the title.

00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:29.431
MARISHA: I'm a little nervous.

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:30.768
SAM: (whispering) Say the title of the game!

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:34.500
MARISHA: I'm going to say the title of the game,
that's going to be my line to go into it! Come on!

00:00:34.773 --> 00:00:35.818
SAM: I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

00:00:35.818 --> 00:00:45.059
MARISHA: Always a director. Anyway, 826LA is-- oh
shit, sorry. 826LA--

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.521
(laughter)

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.568
LIAM: (in mobster voice) When you only do it once
or twice a year it's pretty fucking nerve

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:52.054
wracking, am I right?

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:56.461
MARISHA: It is very nerve wracking! Okay, here we
go. 826LA is an amazing charity that we support

00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:02.287
that helps children-- kindergarten all the way
through senior year of high school-- to learn

00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:09.608
better skills to read and write creatively. They
do a wonderful young authors program. And they

00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:13.853
always have these amazing little stores that you
can go to in their front. Out here in L.A. it's

00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:18.748
The Time Travel Mart. They're great little date
places as Taliesin has pointed out before. Go

00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:29.292
check it out, see if one is in your area and maybe
volunteer. I think that's about it. Without

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:36.025
further ado, let's get into Honey Heist 2:
Electric Beargaloo!

00:01:36.025 --> 00:02:07.573
[jazzy theme music]

00:02:07.573 --> 00:02:16.979
MARISHA: Okay. It has been exactly seven months
and 28 days since the Hazel Festival in Westruun.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:22.083
It's been a hot year this year in Whitestone,
almost as if the city is making up for lost time

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:28.283
from its dreary history. As the sun is setting
over Whitestone Castle, the air is still hot and

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:36.226
sticky from the humidity. Vex and Percy have a few
bags packed and are waiting by the front door, a

00:02:36.226 --> 00:02:41.267
floppy brimmed sun-hat resting on the pile. The
happy couple are getting ready to leave for their

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:46.235
annual Vox Machina summer reunion vacation in
Dalen's Closet.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.070
LIAM: Oh wow.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.220
MARISHA: Trinket.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.318
MATT: Yeah?

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:56.005
MARISHA: You are sitting poutily in the foyer
watching the hustle and bustle and the chaos

00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:01.470
around you as Vex and Percy try to rush out the
door. You know what this means: they're leaving

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.732
and you're not going with them.

00:03:03.732 --> 00:03:06.780
MATT: (sad bear huffing)

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.379
MARISHA: Vex walks up to you. "Percy darling, are
we almost ready to go? (quietly) Where are you?

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.004
"(louder) Keyleth will be here at the Sun Tree to
pick us up in five minutes!"

00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:19.550
(laughter)

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.050
MARISHA: "Oh Trinket darling, don't give me that
pouty face. Look, you know I would love to take

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.368
"you, but whatever casino Scanlan booked us at
doesn't take bears, I'm so sorry."

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:33.937
MATT: (disappointed bear huffing)

00:03:33.937 --> 00:03:39.840
MARISHA: "I know. But I need you here to hold down
the fort! You are in charge while I'm gone, okay?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.820
"I have arranged for plenty of treats while I'm
gone."

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.385
MATT: (excited bear growl)

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:47.263
MARISHA: "Yeah! So you have to be a good boy-- "

00:03:47.263 --> 00:03:48.366
MATT: (sniffing)

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:55.555
MARISHA: "No, don't, that's not for you. Okay. I
love you! I'll see you in a week." She rubs your

00:03:55.555 --> 00:04:00.007
"fur and gives you a kiss. (yelling) "Percy?! Come
on!"

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:04.289
(laughter)

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:05.452
MATT: We knew that was going down.

00:04:05.452 --> 00:04:07.318
TALIESIN: Too real.

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:08.767
BRIAN: (as Percy) I'm in the bath!

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:12.346
(laughter)

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:20.542
MARISHA: They quickly, in a flash, gather their
things, half of a sleeve on Percy's jacket as he

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:24.023
runs out the door and the door closes behind you.

00:04:25.183 --> 00:04:27.348
MATT: (sad bear growl)

00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:36.826
MARISHA: You're a little bit alone. It's a little
dark, it's a little quiet. Whatever you want to do

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:39.661
for a minute. Take this moment for yourself.

00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:42.053
MATT: I'm going to try and sniff where those
treats are.

00:04:42.436 --> 00:04:43.964
MARISHA: Okay. Roll for bear.

00:04:43.964 --> 00:04:45.405
SAM: Roll for bear.

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:51.932
MARISHA: You have to roll a d6 equal to or lower
than your current bear stat.

00:04:51.932 --> 00:04:53.692
MATT: Five. That's a failure.

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:58.947
MARISHA: Ooh okay. So you're a little bit
frustrated you can't find them. I don't think

00:04:58.947 --> 00:04:59.796
they're actually--

00:04:59.796 --> 00:05:01.300
MATT: (frustrated bear growling)

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:11.844
MARISHA: --here yet. So move one point from
criminal into bear. As you decide to move into the

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:17.245
pantry back into the cupboard, you're looking
around. As you step out you try to go downstairs

00:05:17.245 --> 00:05:24.370
into the basement, into the cellar and a light
clicks on. Little torch.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.267
(laughter)

00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:29.803
MARISHA: Click! Whoosh!

00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:30.857
LIAM: It's magic!

00:05:30.857 --> 00:05:40.908
MARISHA: Magic torch! Sitting there, in an awesome
blue blazer power suit, is Tova from the High Bear

00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:49.611
Nation. She crosses her legs. She has red
lipstick, and she looks at you and she goes, "Oh

00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:54.087
"hello, Mama's Bear. Long time no see."

00:05:54.087 --> 00:06:04.714
MATT: I adjust my armor, cross my bear arms and
go: Yeah. It's been about six months if I recall.

00:06:04.714 --> 00:06:13.718
MARISHA: "Yeah. Seven months, actually, almost
eight. But who's counting? Look, the High Bear

00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:22.992
"Nation is in need and you-- and whatever that team
was that you had six or so months ago-- you're our

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:24.550
"last resort."

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.003
MATT: I'm not supposed to leave. I'm watching the
place for Mom while they're gone on vacation.

00:06:30.003 --> 00:06:37.075
MARISHA: "Oh, I know. I was waiting for the
perfect time. Look, I'll make sure we have a

00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:42.878
"representative here watching over the place while
you're gone. Nothing will happen. But I need you

00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:52.581
"to go get the gang back together. Look, here's the
deal: Remember those ninja bears that kind of

00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.795
"crashed into that cellar?"

00:06:55.795 --> 00:06:58.329
MATT: I think about it every night.

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:12.314
MARISHA: "Yeah, me too. They're representatives of
the Bear Acuda. We have gotten word that their

00:07:12.314 --> 00:07:13.826
"leader, Hattori Bongo--"

00:07:13.826 --> 00:07:22.382
(laughter)

00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:26.317
MARISHA: "--has taken control of our main honey
depot."

00:07:26.317 --> 00:07:29.604
MATT: I'm sorry, what depot?

00:07:29.604 --> 00:07:30.510
SAM: Honey.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.682
MATT: Oh, honey depot.

00:07:31.682 --> 00:07:37.619
MARISHA: "It is Tal'Dorei's largest honey depot,
it is owned by the government. It's also known as

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:38.828
"Fort Lox."

00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:46.143
(stifled laughter)

00:07:46.143 --> 00:07:47.022
MATT: Right, right.

00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:53.469
MARISHA: "Now look, we've seen a few people go in
there and they haven't come back. We've sent a few

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:58.963
"of our own and the only person that we have gotten
information back from is through one Message

00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:02.446
"spell; a man named Kody. Kody Yak."

00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:06.456
SAM: (giggles)

00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:11.592
MARISHA: "Apparently, Hattori Bongo is trying to
make Fort Lox his new criminal headquarters. This

00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:18.087
"means there have been no shipments of honey coming
in or out of the Fort. No shipments of honey,

00:08:18.087 --> 00:08:26.781
"means no delivering of honey, means... Well, it
just means no honey. I feel like that's pretty clear."

00:08:27.213 --> 00:08:30.324
MATT: Yeah, no, I got that on the first time
through. Appreciate the clarification.

00:08:30.324 --> 00:08:36.656
MARISHA: "So I figure with your interests in The
Slayer's Cake and the good work that you did last

00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:39.476
"time, maybe you would be down to help us."

00:08:39.476 --> 00:08:44.270
MATT: You promise you'll have someone reputable
watch over the castle?

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:51.256
MARISHA: "I promise I will put my best men that
are under you because I would have sent them into

00:08:51.256 --> 00:08:55.709
"Fort Lox but they're not that good, but they're
good enough to babysit a house."

00:08:55.709 --> 00:09:02.292
MATT: Can I meet at least one of them? Get a smell
off them? See if I can trust them?

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:10.698
MARISHA: "Sure. Yeah, I'll take you out back." She
steps out and she gives a whistle, which I'm not

00:09:10.698 --> 00:09:12.445
going to do because I'm not very good at it.

00:09:12.445 --> 00:09:13.719
BRIAN: (whistles)

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:14.680
MATT: Imagination.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:21.746
MARISHA: You see a couple bears stand up out of
the bushes. Didn't even see them before. One tips

00:09:21.746 --> 00:09:22.469
his head.

00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:27.206
MATT: Do I get a sense that I can trust these
bears?

00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:31.253
MARISHA: Roll for... bear?

00:09:31.253 --> 00:09:34.802
MATT: That's a success!

00:09:34.802 --> 00:09:44.651
MARISHA: Yeah, they seem good enough. They look
tough. They look like guys who you probably

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:50.125
wouldn't want to meet in a back alleyway or a back
forest or behind a tree or wherever bears hang out.

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:57.758
MATT: All right. Tova, I accept your deal. Only
problem is I don't know where the rest of the

00:09:57.956 --> 00:10:00.611
troupe is. We've been scattered over the past half
a year.

00:10:00.611 --> 00:10:05.036
MARISHA: "I've caught a little bit of word that
they've been hanging out in the woods just north

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:06.094
"of here, actually."

00:10:06.094 --> 00:10:08.592
MATT: In the Parchwood?

00:10:08.592 --> 00:10:13.050
MARISHA: "Yeah, we have informants everywhere. We
keep an eye out on everybody."

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.024
MATT: All right.

00:10:15.024 --> 00:10:22.318
MARISHA: "And look: this is a risky task. I'd like
you to go ahead and clear out all of the Bear

00:10:22.318 --> 00:10:30.068
"Acuda's clan that has rested in there including
Hattori Bongo. Either get him to surrender or kill

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:36.860
"him. I don't care. If you do this, you can take
ten percent of whatever honey stock is left in

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:47.539
"Fort Lox. If you fail, well. Say goodbye to any
income from The Slayer's Cake, I guess."

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:53.851
MATT: (growls) All right, you got a deal, Tova.

00:10:53.851 --> 00:11:00.312
MARISHA: She pulls out her kind of big, awesome,
thick, muscular hands.

00:11:00.312 --> 00:11:04.882
(impressed noises)

00:11:04.882 --> 00:11:05.884
LIAM: You mean Noelle, right?

00:11:05.884 --> 00:11:06.615
MARISHA: What's that?

00:11:06.615 --> 00:11:07.680
LIAM: You just mean Noelle, right?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:15.097
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Oh yeah, she works out, you can
tell. With that, Tova slips out, wishes you

00:11:15.097 --> 00:11:19.216
farewell. Says, "Check in with me when you're
done. I'll be waiting nearby."

00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:21.166
MATT: All right. Thanks.

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:24.765
MARISHA: Feel free to do anything you want to
prepare.

00:11:24.765 --> 00:11:33.426
MATT: Okay. I'm going to go ahead and check up in
my mother's room, in Mama Vex's room and see if

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:38.741
she has access to any sort of a satchel or pack
that could have some enchantment that could help

00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:39.863
us carry things along.

00:11:39.863 --> 00:11:44.568
MARISHA: Okay, so you're raiding Vex's closet? All
right, go ahead and roll for criminal as you're

00:11:44.568 --> 00:11:47.465
kind of stealing from Mom's wallet right now.

00:11:47.465 --> 00:11:48.139
MATT: Borrowing!

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:48.803
MARISHA: Okay.

00:11:48.803 --> 00:11:51.097
MATT: That's a failure.

00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:56.673
MARISHA: Ooh okay, you look around, you don't find
anything. Move from bear to criminal.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.648
MATT: All right. Shit!

00:11:59.648 --> 00:12:04.581
MARISHA: Unfortunately, it looks like she has
packed all of her remaining bags to take to

00:12:04.581 --> 00:12:05.591
Dalen's Closet.

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.292
SAM: She would.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.148
MATT: I respect that.

00:12:07.148 --> 00:12:12.116
MARISHA: And a lot of her wardrobe seems to be
gone as well. She's really cleaned out her closet.

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:19.985
MATT: Could have used that bag of holding. Okay
then. Let's see. I'm going to go ahead and go to

00:12:20.195 --> 00:12:25.839
the armory of Whitestone Castle and see if I can
find any rope, chains, weaponry.

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:32.816
MARISHA: Okay. You make your way downstairs to
Percy's workshop room. You try and trigger the

00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:34.655
door a little bit and it seems to be locked.

00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:44.733
MATT: I'm going to go see if I can get some very
tiny, well-made silverware from the kitchen and

00:12:44.733 --> 00:12:45.722
use it to pick the lock.

00:12:45.722 --> 00:12:51.891
MARISHA: You know where the silverware is no
problem. Roll for criminal.

00:12:51.891 --> 00:12:53.770
MATT: Success!

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.481
SAM: Hey!

00:12:54.481 --> 00:13:01.035
MARISHA: You've seen Percy go in and out quite a
bit, you know how to open this, and you just

00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:09.330
simple latch. It's like a cat who knows how to
open the bathroom door. You go downstairs. You

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:15.406
take a look around. You find some rope, pretty
easily. What else were you looking for?

00:13:15.406 --> 00:13:20.644
MATT: Rope, chains, any weaponry that might be
useful because I know we're going up against ninja bears.

00:13:20.644 --> 00:13:30.429
MARISHA: Roll for... I don't know, what would this
be, searching? Bear? It's so hard! There's only

00:13:30.429 --> 00:13:31.403
two stats!

00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:34.949
MATT: Looking for weaponry in a hidden place.

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:36.225
MARISHA: It's probably criminal right?

00:13:36.225 --> 00:13:38.962
MATT: All right. That's a failure.

00:13:38.962 --> 00:13:48.725
MARISHA: You don't find any chains or any
weaponry. The one thing that you do find, though,

00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:52.197
is a potion that was sitting on the wall.

00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:54.373
BRIAN and SAM: Ooh!

00:13:54.373 --> 00:13:55.187
MATT: I like that.

00:13:55.187 --> 00:14:01.423
MARISHA: Everything else seems to be properly
locked up in a very well protected gun locker with

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:03.681
the key very well hidden.

00:14:03.681 --> 00:14:13.794
MATT: Good for him. Being safe with his firearms.
Responsible owner. Especially with children on the

00:14:13.794 --> 00:14:14.532
way, probably.

00:14:14.532 --> 00:14:20.545
MARISHA: Okay, any last things you want to look
for?

00:14:20.545 --> 00:14:24.734
MATT: I guess it's time to assemble the team. I'm
going to go ahead and make my way out to the

00:14:24.734 --> 00:14:28.688
Parchwood and start sniffing for any familiar
scents. Find my allies.

00:14:28.688 --> 00:14:36.989
MARISHA: It's pretty dark. When Vex and Percy left
it was already getting right at sunset. They were

00:14:36.989 --> 00:14:45.054
trying to get a head start on the time zones. You
know, catch that red eye. Anyway, make your way,

00:14:45.054 --> 00:14:48.530
do a bear sense as you go into the woods.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.479
SAM: (whispers) Bear sense!

00:14:49.479 --> 00:14:51.671
MATT: That's a failure.

00:14:51.671 --> 00:14:53.234
SAM and BRIAN: Ooh!

00:14:53.234 --> 00:15:02.803
MARISHA: You don't find anybody. You look for a
few hours. After a while, does someone else want

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:04.005
to make a bear sense?

00:15:04.005 --> 00:15:07.106
LIAM: Hell yeah! How do I do this again?

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.708
MARISHA: Okay, roll a d6.

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:09.407
LIAM: Just one.

00:15:09.407 --> 00:15:14.811
MARISHA: Just one. Every one of you have things
that you are good at. Trinket, you're a grizzly,

00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:20.841
you're good at terrifying things. If you're good
at something, you get to roll twice and take the

00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:22.371
lower. You basically have advantage.

00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:30.686
LIAM: Well, I'm always looking for honey. Nah. I'm
going to see if I sense anything with my bear

00:15:30.686 --> 00:15:35.822
senses. That's a success! That is a one.

00:15:35.822 --> 00:15:43.038
MARISHA: That is a one. Okay. As you're looking
for honey, you think you hear something in the

00:15:43.038 --> 00:15:48.120
woods. You're thinking maybe hyenas or coyotes
coming up.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.664
LIAM: Are we all together as group?

00:15:49.664 --> 00:15:52.315
MARISHA: You are all together as a group, yeah.

00:15:52.315 --> 00:15:56.752
LIAM: Holy shit, get ready. I think we're going to
have a tussle!

00:15:56.752 --> 00:16:05.001
MARISHA: You hear some twigs snapping under what's
clearly a very heavy weight. About this time,

00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:10.308
Trinket comes out of the woods, very frustrated,
very irritated, and a little tired.

00:16:10.308 --> 00:16:12.896
MATT: Oh, finally.

00:16:12.896 --> 00:16:14.245
LIAM: Son of a fuck.

00:16:14.245 --> 00:16:16.425
TALIESIN: Look who the cat dragged in.

00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:18.292
LIAM: The Whitestone Wonder.

00:16:18.292 --> 00:16:21.107
BRIAN: (groaning) Ugh.

00:16:21.107 --> 00:16:24.927
(laughter)

00:16:24.927 --> 00:16:26.572
MATT: Good to see you too, Las Vegas.

00:16:26.572 --> 00:16:27.858
BRIAN: Yeah, welcome back.

00:16:27.858 --> 00:16:33.314
SAM: Hey, (stuttering) how's it going, Trinket?
It's been a while since we've seen you.

00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:35.890
MATT: You all right, Peddy?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:45.353
SAM: I'm coming down off a meat bender. I haven't
eaten meat in so many years. I couldn't resist

00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:50.959
anymore. I had so much. (sniffles) I'm coming down
pretty hard. (sniffles) You got any meat?

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:51.670
MATT: I slap him.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.008
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:56.095
MATT: Success.

00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:58.242
MARISHA: He slaps you.

00:16:58.242 --> 00:17:00.401
SAM: I needed that.

00:17:00.401 --> 00:17:02.351
MATT: Pull it together, Peddy.

00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:04.964
SAM: I can't. I just fell off the wagon.

00:17:04.964 --> 00:17:07.147
MATT: Well, I need you back on it.

00:17:07.147 --> 00:17:08.838
SAM: What do you mean? What's going on?

00:17:08.838 --> 00:17:10.403
BRIAN: Give him some Bear-nadryl.

00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:14.669
LIAM: My man Las Vegas with the puns!

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:16.999
BRIAN: Ay. I just woke up.

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:25.469
MATT: Friends, compatriots, or whatever the hell
you might be, we did some good work a while back,

00:17:25.469 --> 00:17:26.234
did we not?

00:17:26.234 --> 00:17:27.656
TALIESIN: It's true.

00:17:27.656 --> 00:17:29.491
LIAM: Yeah, it was a good thing.

00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:30.514
SAM: There was some honey.

00:17:30.514 --> 00:17:36.966
MATT: Well, word came to me not too long ago that
there might be another operation that could use

00:17:36.966 --> 00:17:43.710
our particular skill sets. So as opposed to
wandering here in the forest, failing to find

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:51.403
honey, gorging on meat, and sleeping until it's
nighttime, like an asshole, how about we all get

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:55.841
back together for another try at the gains and the
glory, huh?

00:17:55.841 --> 00:18:00.995
LIAM: Well, I don't know. I don't know, Trink. You
know, we had a good thing going for a long time

00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:06.003
there and then you seemed a little less
interested. Now you're in need, you come looking

00:18:06.003 --> 00:18:08.688
for us. Interesting, interesting.

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:15.246
SAM: I thought we were out of this game. I thought
we were going legit. Now he's pulling us back in.

00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:23.616
MATT: No, no. We ain't heisting <i>from</i> the
government. We're heisting <i>for</i> the government.

00:18:23.616 --> 00:18:26.451
BRIAN: Ooh. But their benefits are bad.

00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:31.751
MATT: They're hoping to get more things from the
Tal'Dorei Council to improve our sight and

00:18:31.751 --> 00:18:33.500
healthcare, but we're a few months off.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.014
BRIAN: What kind of gold are they offering? And by
gold, I mean honey, because it's gold.

00:18:37.014 --> 00:18:44.114
MATT: Because it is indeed golden. Word is, this
terrible Bear Acuda-- the people we tussled with

00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:52.191
back then-- they've taken Fort Lox. They've taken
it good, and all the honey that'd been making its

00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:59.037
way out here to the sweet side of this end of the
Lucidian Ocean, it's caught up. That means,

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:03.386
whatever you're enjoying? That's going to dry real
fast unless someone does something.

00:19:03.386 --> 00:19:06.663
LIAM: We are talking about <i>the</i> Fort Lox?

00:19:06.663 --> 00:19:08.192
MATT: That's what we're talking about, buddy.

00:19:08.192 --> 00:19:12.653
SAM: No, no, no. It's impenetrable. Impenetrable!
Can't be done.

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:18.310
MATT: Except they did it. If they can do it, we
can do it better. Right, Peddy?

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:23.426
SAM: I don't know. I'm a little shook up still. I
got these headaches and fevers. I need a little

00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:25.992
more meat and then I'll be okay.

00:19:25.992 --> 00:19:30.208
MATT: Tell you what. I know these woods pretty
well. Maybe a quarter-mile up the way I know

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:34.584
there's a little bit of a patch of bamboo. Used to
be part of a de Rolo garden long ago, before it

00:19:34.584 --> 00:19:37.139
was forgotten. You think that'll help wake you up
a little?

00:19:37.139 --> 00:19:41.630
SAM: I haven't had bamboo in three months. It's
why I've been turning to the meat.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:47.510
MATT: Walk with me. All of you, walk with me.
Let's check in. We all might be a little rusty.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.395
See what skills we got in the bag, huh?

00:19:49.395 --> 00:19:52.624
LIAM: What do you think, Waffle? Are the Sweets
Brothers back in business?

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:59.061
TALIESIN: Well, he certainly sweetened the pot for
me. I say we follow, see where this leads.

00:19:59.061 --> 00:20:00.603
MATT: I'll tell you more along the way, come on.

00:20:00.603 --> 00:20:01.708
LIAM: Lead away, Big Bear.

00:20:01.708 --> 00:20:02.861
SAM: Coming, Las Vegas?

00:20:02.861 --> 00:20:07.348
BRIAN: (sighs) Let's do it.

00:20:07.348 --> 00:20:10.097
SAM: One more time for old time's sake?

00:20:10.097 --> 00:20:13.119
BRIAN: One more old time for your sake, yeah.
Let's do it.

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.672
SAM: Saking it for the olds.

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:18.106
BRIAN: We're going to forsake all others and--

00:20:18.106 --> 00:20:21.067
TALIESIN: Let's forsake that time for the one
more.

00:20:21.067 --> 00:20:28.735
BRIAN: Carp-- carp the DMs. I got enough booze to
last us three days.

00:20:28.735 --> 00:20:31.986
(laughter)

00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:32.849
MATT: Cheers to that.

00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:40.130
MARISHA: You all head to the banks of the river
and find the cache of bamboo that Vex has been

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:48.448
slowly working on growing. As you talk and figure
out your plans, we're going to roll for roles.

00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:50.833
MATT: Who's going first?

00:20:50.833 --> 00:21:01.471
LIAM: I'm going first because I said so. Here it
comes. Hey, that's a six.

00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:02.638
MARISHA: You're The Face.

00:21:02.638 --> 00:21:04.628
LIAM: Hey, hey, hey!

00:21:04.628 --> 00:21:05.924
BRIAN: That's a good face.

00:21:05.924 --> 00:21:09.547
LIAM: Badda bing, badda boom!

00:21:09.547 --> 00:21:10.576
MARISHA: I love it.

00:21:10.576 --> 00:21:14.338
TALIESIN: Here we go. Do I reroll if I got the
same thing?

00:21:14.338 --> 00:21:17.950
MARISHA: You can be the same thing if you want.
I'm going to say your choice.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:18.980
TALIESIN: I want to keep going.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.950
BRIAN: It's just his face repeated.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.409
TALIESIN: I'm The Brains.

00:21:23.409 --> 00:21:29.135
MARISHA: You're The Brains! The Face and The
Brains, Cookie and Waffle.

00:21:29.135 --> 00:21:31.889
LIAM: You got all you need right here, is what I'm
saying.

00:21:31.889 --> 00:21:33.875
TALIESIN: Yeah. I know what we're doing.

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:35.348
MARISHA: Peddy Tuxpin.

00:21:35.348 --> 00:21:42.071
SAM: Wait, what? I am The Driver.

00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:43.190
MARISHA: You're The Driver!

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.948
BRIAN: Let the guy who's going through withdrawal
drive us around.

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:53.126
SAM: I'll be fine. Just got to keep it between the
two yellows.

00:21:53.126 --> 00:21:56.169
MARISHA: Liam Las Vegas has taught you quite a bit
over the past seven months.

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:58.655
BRIAN: Yes, he has. Taught him about many things.

00:21:58.655 --> 00:22:01.588
MATT: After he crashed the last wagon, they won't
let him back.

00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:03.495
MARISHA: He got his license revoked.

00:22:03.495 --> 00:22:10.199
MATT: All right. Trinket this time has been
focusing a little more of his downtime to be a--

00:22:10.199 --> 00:22:11.143
what's a five?

00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:12.469
MARISHA: The Thief.

00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:13.287
LIAM: Again!

00:22:13.287 --> 00:22:21.719
MATT: In fact, I've been focusing my skills even
further, the same path! Look, my papa-in-law,

00:22:21.719 --> 00:22:26.482
bless his soul, and Mama Vex has dabbled a bit in
that direction. I paid attention. I think it's

00:22:26.482 --> 00:22:31.221
time that I follow in the family's footsteps, you
know? Thief it is.

00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:34.136
LIAM: You know what they always say about Trinket.
Consistency.

00:22:34.136 --> 00:22:38.434
MARISHA: All right, Liam Las Vegas.

00:22:38.434 --> 00:22:39.839
MATT: What you got, Vegas?

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:46.705
MARISHA: Looking for a one or a four.

00:22:46.705 --> 00:22:48.437
LIAM: Liam, hurry it up, you stubborn prick, you!

00:22:48.437 --> 00:22:51.835
BRIAN: You're looking at The Muscle.

00:22:51.835 --> 00:22:54.377
(laughter)

00:22:54.377 --> 00:23:00.387
SAM: The small guy. You have been working out a
little bit. That's why you're always asleep.

00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:02.154
LIAM: You and that Atkins.

00:23:02.154 --> 00:23:03.570
BRIAN: I got gout too, though.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.997
LIAM: Plusses and minuses.

00:23:05.997 --> 00:23:10.559
MATT: It's a sliding scale, really. Looking fit. I
think we could use you at the front.

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:13.906
BRIAN: I'll be at the front. I'll be in the back.
I'll be everywhere you need me.

00:23:13.906 --> 00:23:22.739
MATT: All right. I think we got a pretty good
spread here, guys. Not too bad.

00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:28.127
SAM: While you guys start thinking up a plan, I'm
going to indulge in some bamboo, if that's all

00:23:28.127 --> 00:23:28.987
right with youse.

00:23:28.987 --> 00:23:32.827
BRIAN: Do you think your system will be okay with
it? I mean, it's been, you know--

00:23:32.827 --> 00:23:38.762
SAM: I need it bad. I need something bad. I got
the jitters. I got the shakes. I got the bear

00:23:38.762 --> 00:23:48.483
legs. I got the upstreams. That's where you try to
pee, but it goes upstream.

00:23:48.483 --> 00:23:55.737
LIAM: Peddy, you're getting back in. Take it
orally, all right? Don't mess around with your

00:23:55.737 --> 00:24:01.837
backside, your snout. Straight ace. You got to
start slow.

00:24:01.837 --> 00:24:07.091
SAM: That's smart. Okay. I'm going to try to eat
some bamboo. Calm myself down.

00:24:07.091 --> 00:24:13.261
MARISHA: All right, roll for bear? I think with
advantage?

00:24:13.261 --> 00:24:14.638
SAM: I succeeded.

00:24:14.638 --> 00:24:20.550
MARISHA: Okay. You successfully chill out a little
bit. I would say you take one point from bear to

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.581
criminal. Calm down a little bit.

00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:30.065
SAM: This is the stuff. I haven't tasted this in
so long. Thanks, Trinket, for the hookup. That

00:24:30.065 --> 00:24:33.798
meat, it does terrible things to the system. It's
really awful.

00:24:33.798 --> 00:24:36.767
LIAM: Yeah. You know, we tried to tide him over
with eucalyptus? Didn't work.

00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:38.371
SAM: Not the same thing.

00:24:38.371 --> 00:24:42.270
MATT: Yeah, well, it's hard to get it out here.
Rots away by the time you get it over the ocean.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:51.250
All right, so here's the deal. The Bear Acuda have
taken Fort Lox. It's all under their management,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:56.115
their holding. There's one at the top. One son of
a bitch.

00:24:56.115 --> 00:24:57.092
BRIAN: Who is it?

00:24:57.092 --> 00:24:58.841
MATT: Hattori Bongo.

00:24:58.841 --> 00:25:00.650
SAM: Have we heard of him?

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:06.324
MATT: <i>The</i> Hattori Bongo himself. Thought dead
for many years. Out of hiding, takes the fort for

00:25:06.324 --> 00:25:11.312
himself. Ain't no one standing up to him. That's
where we come in. They're looking for assaults,

00:25:11.312 --> 00:25:16.686
armies, broken at their gates. But five
slick-as-shit bears coming in there in the

00:25:16.686 --> 00:25:19.944
shadows? And a badger. Four-- look.

00:25:19.944 --> 00:25:20.927
LIAM: Honorary bear.

00:25:20.927 --> 00:25:21.785
BRIAN: It's kind of a bear.

00:25:21.785 --> 00:25:26.073
LIAM: We agreed on honorary bear. Why you always
got to bring it up? You're part of the family.

00:25:26.073 --> 00:25:29.832
BRIAN: You know how I feel about things being
intrinsic rather than complimented.

00:25:29.832 --> 00:25:37.762
(laughter)

00:25:37.762 --> 00:25:42.220
MATT: I appreciate you being forward with that and
we respect your sensitivity to the matter, and

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.886
we'll keep that in mind going forward.

00:25:43.886 --> 00:25:44.589
BRIAN: Thank you.

00:25:44.589 --> 00:25:47.362
MATT: But seriously, get with the program.

00:25:47.362 --> 00:25:50.460
BRIAN: I've been in the program for years; it's
not helping.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:58.103
MATT: We got to get in there, take out, destroy,
kill, disseminate, disintegrate, whatever-- these

00:25:58.103 --> 00:26:04.661
ninja bears get in our way, find this Hattori
Bongo, take him out alive or dead; I haven't been

00:26:04.661 --> 00:26:14.431
given a preference, and if we can free, the honey
flows free. And this group of five right here? We

00:26:14.431 --> 00:26:17.711
get to take a ten percent cut <i>ad infinitum</i>.

00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:18.548
LIAM: Ten percent?

00:26:18.548 --> 00:26:19.229
MATT: Ten percent.

00:26:19.229 --> 00:26:22.912
LIAM: Oh, we're going to beat this Bongo
motherfucker like a drum.

00:26:23.322 --> 00:26:29.513
SAM: I don't know. I've heard of this guy. He
doesn't just kill you, he declaws you first. Yeah.

00:26:29.513 --> 00:26:31.149
He's bad business.

00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:32.347
LIAM: That's just talk.

00:26:32.347 --> 00:26:34.178
TALIESIN: That's noise in your ears. That ain't
true.

00:26:34.178 --> 00:26:36.333
MATT: It might be a little true.

00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:39.677
LIAM and TALIESIN: That ain't good.

00:26:39.677 --> 00:26:43.796
MATT: That's why we got to strike first. We got to
strike.

00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:48.100
BRIAN: I might know a thing or two about Bongos.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.358
SAM: Like what?

00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:58.150
BRIAN: You say Bear Acuda. Those guys we ran into
back during the festival? I been running a few

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:04.089
side jobs while you've been gone. Yeah, we've been
doing our thing, but I've got to make coin to keep

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:14.731
up with all of my hmm-hmm. Ran a few side jobs for
this guy, Vinnie the Pooh. He was an all right

00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:23.723
guy. Paid pretty well. Laid pretty well. Anyways,
Vinnie had me do a job where I was driving for

00:27:23.723 --> 00:27:29.396
these guys-- transporting something, I didn't know
what it was-- but the ninjas were there.

00:27:29.396 --> 00:27:30.962
SAM: They were there?

00:27:30.962 --> 00:27:34.486
BRIAN: They were escorting us, like some kind of
security.

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.613
SAM: Where was it?

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:40.078
BRIAN: It was in the forest outside Whitestone.

00:27:40.078 --> 00:27:45.305
MATT: That's right. There's a section of the
Parchwood right there. It's about a hundred acres

00:27:45.305 --> 00:27:46.093
of wood.

00:27:46.093 --> 00:27:52.622
BRIAN: It's actually 1,972 acres, to be exact.

00:27:52.622 --> 00:27:54.630
MATT: That's a lot of acres.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:28:00.146
LIAM: Point of order with the honey runner: that
did seem an awful lot like a heist flashback.

00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:09.963
MARISHA: You guys are planning currently. But
yeah, if you want to take it to voluntarily move a

00:28:09.963 --> 00:28:10.762
point, I'll allow it.

00:28:10.762 --> 00:28:13.433
LIAM: Well, this guy just talked about a past
job.

00:28:13.433 --> 00:28:14.630
MARISHA: That's true.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.550
SAM: Do you want to flash back to it?

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:23.631
LIAM: He just did it. You saw it. What does he
get? Extra salmon? A honey pot?

00:28:23.631 --> 00:28:26.655
MARISHA: If you want, you can move a point from
bear to criminal.

00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:28.284
SAM: I'm going to need a little more flashback.

00:28:28.284 --> 00:28:29.480
MARISHA: It's voluntarily.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:36.924
BRIAN: I'll wait. Yeah, I'll wait. (whispering) I
forgot about the flashback thing.

00:28:36.924 --> 00:28:44.596
MARISHA: You can voluntarily move a point from
bear to criminal if you all choose to take a

00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:50.276
criminal planning sequence flashback. That's up to
you guys, if you're feeling like you're on the brink.

00:28:50.276 --> 00:28:51.629
LIAM: All the bears got to get involved?

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:57.539
MARISHA: It's voluntarily, so up for whoever wants
to be a part of it.

00:28:57.539 --> 00:28:59.280
LIAM: Got it, got it, got it.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.104
MARISHA: If you are getting pretty high on
criminal, you can move a point from criminal to

00:29:03.104 --> 00:29:05.203
bear by eating a shitload of honey.

00:29:05.203 --> 00:29:08.674
MATT: We got to get honey to eat it.

00:29:08.674 --> 00:29:13.271
MARISHA: Yeah, you all currently have no honey.
You forgot to pick that up.

00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:18.777
MATT: Well we can go back to Whitestone. I was
trying to find these dewies, right? We haven't

00:29:18.777 --> 00:29:19.256
left yet.

00:29:19.256 --> 00:29:23.049
MARISHA: That's actually true. You are still close
to the castle. If you wanted to backtrack, you could.

00:29:23.694 --> 00:29:25.019
TALIESIN: We may need some honey for the road.

00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:29.512
MATT: I think we're going to need to stock up. How
about you all find your way back on the outskirts

00:29:29.512 --> 00:29:32.112
of Whitestone castle? Don't want to freak out our
guards there.

00:29:32.112 --> 00:29:34.138
LIAM: You got access to that bakery shop?

00:29:34.138 --> 00:29:35.443
MATT: I do indeed.

00:29:35.443 --> 00:29:36.365
LIAM: Fuck yeah.

00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:39.409
MATT: All right, follow me. We all in?

00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:41.762
SAM: You know it.

00:29:41.762 --> 00:29:45.941
BRIAN: (sighing)

00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:47.482
MATT: Three, two, one--

00:29:47.482 --> 00:29:48.302
SAM: I can't count.

00:29:48.302 --> 00:29:50.357
(roaring)

00:29:50.357 --> 00:29:51.077
LIAM: Ka-bear!

00:29:51.077 --> 00:29:55.448
MATT: I like that. All right, come on. I lead them
on back to Whitestone, to the outskirts of

00:29:55.448 --> 00:29:56.264
Whitestone castle.

00:29:56.264 --> 00:29:58.464
MARISHA: Okay. Are you leading them to The
Slayer's Cake?

00:29:58.464 --> 00:30:01.896
MATT: Yes. I'm not taking them through the city.
Wait--

00:30:01.896 --> 00:30:06.532
ALL: Wait.

00:30:06.532 --> 00:30:10.326
MATT: You have to understand, even though it's
late night here, it's going to be hard for us to

00:30:10.326 --> 00:30:15.028
infiltrate the city without freaking folks out who
think we're a bunch of roving bears. We've got to

00:30:15.028 --> 00:30:15.853
disguise ourselves.

00:30:15.853 --> 00:30:17.041
SAM: As what, though?

00:30:17.041 --> 00:30:24.219
MATT: There is one haberdashery inside Whitestone
city. We can help blend in with the locals at

00:30:24.219 --> 00:30:27.739
night time. You know, all the drunken folks who
wear hats and throw up on the sides of the road.

00:30:27.739 --> 00:30:30.896
BRIAN: Hey. Take it easy.

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:33.345
SAM: No offense. He meant no offense.

00:30:33.345 --> 00:30:37.596
BRIAN: All right, all right, all right. Don't fuck
with the muscle before it's had a chance to flex.

00:30:37.596 --> 00:30:41.203
MARISHA: (laughter)

00:30:41.203 --> 00:30:41.948
MATT: Noted.

00:30:41.948 --> 00:30:44.185
SAM: All right, so hats first.

00:30:44.185 --> 00:30:46.542
MATT: Just to blend in, you know.

00:30:46.542 --> 00:30:47.680
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:54.716
MARISHA: You go down to the hat store. Knowing
you, you probably have written one in canon to

00:30:54.716 --> 00:30:58.811
Whitestone that I don't know the name of.

00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:00.493
BRIAN: Is there a hat-chery around?

00:31:00.493 --> 00:31:08.852
MATT: I didn't have one specifically named, but--
I don't know, you're the one who designed most of

00:31:08.852 --> 00:31:09.568
the city's infrastructure.

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:14.355
TALIESIN: I know, I'm trying to think of a good
haberdashery name for-- what would be a Whitestone

00:31:14.355 --> 00:31:15.912
haberdashery? Dear god almighty.

00:31:15.912 --> 00:31:17.218
SAM: Hats 'N' Things!

00:31:17.218 --> 00:31:19.746
TALIESIN: Nothin' But Hats.

00:31:19.746 --> 00:31:22.299
(laughter)

00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:27.557
MARISHA: Nothin' But Hats. You guys head down.
It's pretty late. It's the middle of the night.

00:31:27.557 --> 00:31:29.186
LIAM: I do not nut butthatches.

00:31:29.186 --> 00:31:32.801
MARISHA: Nothin' Hatters is not open tonight.

00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:35.862
BRIAN: Looks like we're going to have to break in,
gentlemen.

00:31:35.862 --> 00:31:40.483
MATT: That's where my speciality comes in. You
see, all this time you cats have been wandering

00:31:40.483 --> 00:31:47.877
the forest and eating whatever you stumble upon--
meat for some of us-- I've been practicing my

00:31:47.877 --> 00:31:51.551
skills. And I pull out the same bits of silverware
that I took from the kitchen.

00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:53.070
MARISHA: Trinket is so cocky. I love it.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.373
LIAM: Broken oyster fork.

00:31:54.373 --> 00:32:00.763
MATT: Super tiny. The little things you'd stick on
the ends of the corn cob to make it easy to go.

00:32:01.088 --> 00:32:03.581
All the tiniest bits of silverware that I can get.

00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:05.531
TALIESIN: I imagine you with a spoon, jamming it
open.

00:32:09.321 --> 00:32:13.148
MATT: I'm going to wait until the coast is clear
of any of the various guards and see if I can

00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:15.930
break in through the back of the hat store.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:23.144
MARISHA: Okay. Waffle, why don't you roll for
criminal to keep watch. And you roll for criminal

00:32:23.144 --> 00:32:24.629
to try and pick the lock.

00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:25.514
TALIESIN: I fail.

00:32:25.514 --> 00:32:36.620
MATT: I'm going to take 2d6 on this. Both fail. So
when we fail, we move a point into criminal, right?

00:32:37.153 --> 00:32:41.857
MARISHA: You move a point into bear, because you
are frustrated. With that, you hear (knocking).

00:32:41.857 --> 00:32:49.249
"Ey! Ey, what are you do-- Aww, fucking bears
again! Git! Git!" It sounds a lot like the same

00:32:49.249 --> 00:32:50.239
guards from last time.

00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:55.855
LIAM: I got this, I got this. I've been working on
my Common for the last seven months. Excuse me, my

00:32:55.855 --> 00:33:01.937
good gentlemen. I was wondering if there was any
way for me to purchase a hat at this late hour in

00:33:01.937 --> 00:33:04.130
the evening. Does it sound like growling?

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.397
MARISHA: "Oh, this one's been getting into the
brew stash. Git! Git on!"

00:33:07.397 --> 00:33:08.701
LIAM: Well shit. This is not working!

00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:12.860
SAM: Are there any wagons around? Or things with
wheels?

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:18.339
MARISHA: Yes, there is, back in the alleyway
behind the hattery, a wagon.

00:33:18.339 --> 00:33:19.311
SAM: Is it attached to a horse?

00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:21.043
MARISHA: It is not. It's by itself. It is
unhitched.

00:33:21.043 --> 00:33:26.507
SAM: All right. I'm going to go grab it. I don't
know what I'm going to do! I'm going to grab it

00:33:26.749 --> 00:33:35.131
and try to hitch myself to it. And try to, I don't
know-- blast in front of the guard and hopefully--

00:33:35.131 --> 00:33:37.491
MARISHA: Trying to do a drive by pick up and run
thing?

00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.486
SAM: Yeah. Blast in front of the guards and have
them all come on, jump up.

00:33:40.486 --> 00:33:43.468
MARISHA: Okay. Roll two, take the lowest. Because
this is your specialty.

00:33:43.468 --> 00:33:48.965
SAM: Okay, that's a success. I'll just-- (panting)
Hop on, guys!

00:33:48.965 --> 00:33:55.764
MARISHA: As this guard is poking at you with his
javelin situation, you see this giant panda, Peddy

00:33:55.764 --> 00:33:58.382
Tuxpin, (thudding footsteps) from behind.

00:33:58.382 --> 00:33:59.697
SAM: Hop on! I'll get us out of here!

00:33:59.697 --> 00:34:00.797
MARISHA: Pulls up with the wagon.

00:34:00.797 --> 00:34:02.804
LIAM: We didn't get the hats! What are we doing?

00:34:02.804 --> 00:34:06.262
BRIAN: How big are the guards?

00:34:06.262 --> 00:34:09.944
MARISHA: They're pretty big. And probably have
more coming.

00:34:09.944 --> 00:34:16.097
MATT: I'm going to turn to them and use my Terrify
skill as Trinket to spin around drop my silverware

00:34:16.097 --> 00:34:18.617
and go (roaring).

00:34:18.617 --> 00:34:20.434
MARISHA: Roll two, take the lowest.

00:34:20.434 --> 00:34:26.323
MATT: For bear? That's good, because I had
accidentally misallocated my points earlier. I'm

00:34:26.323 --> 00:34:27.362
on the cusp of going feral.

00:34:27.362 --> 00:34:30.386
MARISHA: You should all always have six points
that go back and forth.

00:34:30.386 --> 00:34:33.676
MATT: Correct, yes. That's a success on bear for
the Terrify skill.

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:41.720
MARISHA: Okay. About that time, the guys drop
their javelins. They take off running. I'd say you

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:47.476
have a little bit of time, but there will now be
reinforcements. Your presence is known.

00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:50.313
MATT: Hey, muscle. Come get the door. You break
that shit down.

00:34:50.313 --> 00:34:51.710
BRIAN: I'm going to break the door down.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.682
MARISHA: Roll for bear with advantage.

00:34:54.682 --> 00:34:57.063
SAM: Wow, bear-vantage.

00:34:57.063 --> 00:34:59.057
BRIAN: Fail!

00:34:59.057 --> 00:35:09.709
MARISHA: (crashing) Your shoulder goes right into
the iron brace bar right across it.

00:35:09.709 --> 00:35:11.463
BRIAN: What kind of ground are we standing on?

00:35:11.463 --> 00:35:15.162
MARISHA: Stone pavers.

00:35:15.162 --> 00:35:20.267
SAM: Hey, hey, I got this cart. Someone want to
jump on it? And hop on the roof?

00:35:20.267 --> 00:35:25.338
MARISHA: About this time, you guys are hearing
more clickity clackity of guards running up.

00:35:25.338 --> 00:35:27.805
LIAM: Why don't we crash it in the doorway, grab
the hats, and go!

00:35:27.805 --> 00:35:28.950
TALIESIN: That's a good idea. Let's do it.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.273
MARISHA: That's what he just tried to do.

00:35:30.273 --> 00:35:32.279
SAM: He didn't break down the door.

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:34.359
LIAM and TALIESIN: With the cart!

00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:43.616
SAM: Oh, okay! I'm going to back it up (beeping).
I'm going to go full throttle and try to slam the

00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:48.551
side of the cart into the door. I've got
afterburners.

00:35:48.551 --> 00:35:52.406
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah. Roll twice, take
the lowest. Why not? I'm curious to see what happens.

00:35:52.431 --> 00:35:53.904
SAM: For which?

00:35:53.904 --> 00:35:54.934
MARISHA: For criminal.

00:35:54.934 --> 00:35:56.030
SAM: That's a success.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:05.197
MARISHA: Okay. You get enough of a running jump,
and as you turn, you get a nice section this big

00:36:05.197 --> 00:36:12.694
or so that crashes through. You splinter the door
inward. I don't think any of you could fit

00:36:12.694 --> 00:36:14.887
through, with the exception of Liam Las Vegas.

00:36:14.887 --> 00:36:19.169
BRIAN: Guys, I'm going to use these muscles to
carry hats back out of here.

00:36:19.169 --> 00:36:22.120
TALIESIN: Grab whatever you can, throw it on the
cart. We're out of here!

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.240
MATT: I'll turn to Liam real fast and say:
Remember what we talked about at the edge of the

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.145
forest. I'll flash back when we were at the
outskirts of the Parchwood and we were sitting

00:36:30.145 --> 00:36:33.764
there, pulling cigarettes out of our mouths, like:
All right, so we want red hats, green hats, brown

00:36:33.764 --> 00:36:38.904
hats, black hats, specifically wide brims, short
brims, long brims, high brims. Whatever type of

00:36:38.904 --> 00:36:41.948
hat you can get, just grab it. We'll see what all
comes out in the wash. All right?

00:36:41.948 --> 00:36:43.384
LIAM: I want something fancy!

00:36:43.384 --> 00:36:44.536
BRIAN: Okay, fancy.

00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:46.672
TALIESIN: Something with a feather, if you've got it.

00:36:46.672 --> 00:36:49.048
SAM: Something made of bamboo?

00:36:49.158 --> 00:36:51.256
BRIAN: Something made of bamboo.

00:36:51.256 --> 00:36:52.807
MARISHA: "Come here! They're over here!"

00:36:52.807 --> 00:36:56.073
BRIAN: Yeah. I'm going to forget this in five
minutes, so can you repeat it then?

00:36:56.073 --> 00:36:57.236
MARISHA: "Come on, Charlie!"

00:36:57.236 --> 00:37:00.399
MATT: Back into the moment. Remember what we said.

00:37:00.399 --> 00:37:06.430
BRIAN: Yes, I remember. Hats, fancy, feather. Then
I dive through the thing, and then I start

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.793
throwing the hats through the hole, if it's big
enough.

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:18.775
MARISHA: Okay. It's like a vending machine. Just
hats. You guys catch. About that, you get a pretty

00:37:18.775 --> 00:37:20.352
good stack. And you guys--

00:37:20.352 --> 00:37:21.851
TALIESIN: Let's get out of here!

00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:23.746
MARISHA: --see the guards coming up running.

00:37:23.746 --> 00:37:26.207
BRIAN: And then I dive back through the thing and
into Trinket's arms.

00:37:26.207 --> 00:37:31.708
MARISHA: Okay. Peddy, as you take off, there's
some guards who try to flank you, coming around

00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:33.871
the other side. Roll for driver to try and get
around them.

00:37:33.871 --> 00:37:38.391
SAM: I'm going to try to scoot right through this
alleyway that I didn't even see before, but it's

00:37:38.391 --> 00:37:39.842
just tight enough to fit through.

00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:45.660
MARISHA: You're like, I can totally make it, I can
totally make it. Ooh, it's getting narrower as I'm

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.306
getting closer. Roll twice, take the lower, for
criminal.

00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:51.203
SAM: Oh, that's a big fail.

00:37:51.203 --> 00:37:52.745
MARISHA: Oh god.

00:37:52.745 --> 00:37:54.347
SAM: I didn't see the overhang!

00:37:54.347 --> 00:37:58.063
(laughter)

00:37:58.063 --> 00:38:03.608
MARISHA: And that's pretty much exactly what
happens. You go through, some of the edges of the

00:38:03.608 --> 00:38:12.607
cart start shattering off. You guys who were
riding, roll for bear to see if you can hold on.

00:38:12.607 --> 00:38:14.135
LIAM: Oh my god!

00:38:14.135 --> 00:38:16.462
MATT, LIAM, and TALIESIN: Fail.

00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:17.501
BRIAN: Success!

00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:26.808
MARISHA: Oh god. Peddy, you are oblivious. You
keep running. The three of you fall off and the

00:38:26.808 --> 00:38:28.989
guards are catching up to you. What do you do?

00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:34.553
LIAM: It didn't work the last time, but I'm going
to talk to these gentlemen. *Monsieur, monsieur,

00:38:34.553 --> 00:38:41.888
monsieur*, we are traveling emissaries-- this all
sounds like this: (growling)-- traveling

00:38:41.888 --> 00:38:51.533
emissaries from the far shores of Huntington
Gardens. We were on a honey and hat tour and we

00:38:51.872 --> 00:38:57.027
seem to have gone astray. I was wondering if you
could guide us to the outskirts of town so we can

00:38:57.027 --> 00:38:59.952
cause your gentle hamburg no more trouble.

00:38:59.952 --> 00:39:02.391
MARISHA: Roll twice for criminal, take the lower.

00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:05.384
LIAM: That is a success.

00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:11.756
MARISHA: Okay. You have six points, right? Yeah,
you're good. Your success.

00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:15.009
LIAM: So that means I go into bear. Succeeds
criminal, go into criminal?

00:39:15.009 --> 00:39:16.727
SAM: Succeed does nothing, right?

00:39:16.727 --> 00:39:25.250
MARISHA: If you succeed, you get more greedy, and
you move one from bear into criminal.

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.568
LIAM: Okay.

00:39:26.568 --> 00:39:33.277
MARISHA: Yes. When the plan goes off without a
hitch, move one point from bear into criminal.

00:39:33.277 --> 00:39:35.615
The guards stop.

00:39:35.615 --> 00:39:37.367
LIAM: (yowling)

00:39:37.367 --> 00:39:40.564
MARISHA: "Were those bears hurting you, good sir?"

00:39:40.564 --> 00:39:43.477
LIAM: (yowling)

00:39:43.477 --> 00:39:48.955
MARISHA: "You must be a tourist. I am so sorry
that you had to experience that in our wonderful

00:39:48.955 --> 00:39:59.050
"city. We're really trying to get our animal
control into a respectable situation. Here, sir."

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:05.823
And he pulls out a little "Welcome to Whitestone"
patch. "We like to give this out to some of our

00:40:05.823 --> 00:40:07.394
"favorite tourists."

00:40:07.394 --> 00:40:08.690
LIAM: I eat it.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:15.834
MARISHA: "Okay sir, uh, thank you so much," and he
turns and walks away. He half-understands you.

00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:20.345
LIAM: He thought I was a firbolg! (cackling)

00:40:20.345 --> 00:40:26.608
SAM: I'm still running full speed.

00:40:26.608 --> 00:40:28.673
TALIESIN: I'm going to gather the hats and get out
of here.

00:40:28.673 --> 00:40:30.885
MATT: Cookie. Mighty impressive.

00:40:30.888 --> 00:40:36.741
MARISHA: You guys that fell off, you gather the
hats that fell off the back of the cart. Following

00:40:37.196 --> 00:40:43.234
Peddy into the outskirts of the city, you guys all
know, more or less, where you're meeting up. After

00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:52.795
a few minutes, you all convene and you all sort
through your prize and get to pick which ones you

00:40:52.795 --> 00:40:54.640
guys want. Let's roll for hats!

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.120
SAM and BRIAN: Roll for hats?

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.268
MARISHA: Roll for hats! Yeah, let's go this way
now since, yeah.

00:41:00.268 --> 00:41:04.067
SAM: Just give us the number.

00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:05.665
MARISHA: Just give me the number and I'll tell
you.

00:41:05.665 --> 00:41:07.232
BRIAN: Six.

00:41:07.232 --> 00:41:09.356
MARISHA: You get the fez.

00:41:09.356 --> 00:41:12.315
SAM: Nice. The muscle always gets the fez.

00:41:12.315 --> 00:41:15.346
BRIAN: It's true, that happened last time. Thank
you.

00:41:15.346 --> 00:41:16.654
MARISHA: Okay, Trinket.

00:41:16.654 --> 00:41:20.381
BRIAN: Support your local Lions club.

00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:22.649
MARISHA: Everyone's rolling a d8 for these,
right?

00:41:22.649 --> 00:41:24.186
BRIAN: No.

00:41:24.186 --> 00:41:27.355
MATT: Five. It's a cowboy hat.

00:41:27.355 --> 00:41:28.940
MARISHA: You get the cowboy hat!

00:41:29.229 --> 00:41:32.223
LIAM: Yes! You played yourself.

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.228
MATT: I did.

00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:34.769
SAM: We're rolling a d8 for this.

00:41:34.769 --> 00:41:35.945
MATT: Oh, it's a d8. Let me roll again.

00:41:35.945 --> 00:41:38.542
MARISHA: Hey team, where did that-- oh, here it
is.

00:41:38.542 --> 00:41:41.525
MATT: Wait, hold on. I rolled the wrong dice.

00:41:41.525 --> 00:41:44.203
BRIAN: Well, I did too, but I don't care, I'll
keep the fez.

00:41:44.203 --> 00:41:49.321
MATT: Well, no, I still rolled a-- the number
would've been a five, same thing.

00:41:49.321 --> 00:41:50.722
MARISHA: The number would've been the same thing.

00:41:50.722 --> 00:41:53.360
MATT: Oh, I still get a-- I still got a five
anyway. So it's the cowboy hat.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.740
LIAM: Give him the torture hat!

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.220
MARISHA: You were destined for the cowboy hat.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.169
LIAM: Yeah, and you can't get away from it, Matt.

00:41:58.187 --> 00:42:00.801
MARISHA: All right, Peddy.

00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:02.446
SAM: Three, that is a bowler.

00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:05.464
MARISHA: Okay, what color bowler do you want? We
have gray, we have green, we have black.

00:42:05.464 --> 00:42:12.643
SAM: I'll go with green, the colorful one. Oh boy,
look at that, I'm like the Riddler.

00:42:12.643 --> 00:42:14.045
MARISHA and TALIESIN: It's exactly what you are.

00:42:14.045 --> 00:42:16.265
MARISHA: Waffle.

00:42:16.265 --> 00:42:18.644
TALIESIN: I also got a three.

00:42:18.644 --> 00:42:24.049
MARISHA: So you also get a bowler unless you
decide you want to mix it up.

00:42:24.049 --> 00:42:25.609
TALIESIN: I'll take the gray bowler.

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:26.930
MARISHA: You want the gray bowler?

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.127
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:42:28.127 --> 00:42:30.313
LIAM: I got you.

00:42:30.313 --> 00:42:31.162
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:42:31.162 --> 00:42:32.639
MARISHA: Cookie.

00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:34.145
LIAM: Boosh. I rolled a six.

00:42:34.145 --> 00:42:35.613
MARISHA: You also get a fez.

00:42:35.613 --> 00:42:37.135
LIAM and BRIAN: Yes!

00:42:37.135 --> 00:42:39.912
SAM: You have multiple fezzes just in case?

00:42:39.912 --> 00:42:41.871
MARISHA: Yeah! We have multiple of a few things.

00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:44.460
LIAM: Will it fit on my gigantic head is the
question.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.206
SAM: No, it's a yarmulke.

00:42:46.529 --> 00:42:50.216
MATT: (laughter) Fits better than my cowboy hat
does.

00:42:50.216 --> 00:42:55.443
MARISHA: You guys all look like members of the
Shriners association, okay.

00:42:55.443 --> 00:42:58.679
BRIAN: Yep. In the little car (sings).

00:42:58.679 --> 00:43:05.892
MARISHA: As you guys are now in the middle of the
dark, north of the woods of Whitestone, you know

00:43:05.892 --> 00:43:12.296
the direction to the 1,972-Acre Woods. It'll
probably take you an hour and a half.

00:43:12.296 --> 00:43:16.363
MATT: Wait, we didn't get any honey. We've got to
go to the Slayer's Cake. The point of getting the

00:43:16.363 --> 00:43:20.251
hats was to hide as people to get the honey
because we've got nothing in our stores.

00:43:20.251 --> 00:43:26.743
MARISHA: You also have the entire guard and
everyone out looking for you?

00:43:26.743 --> 00:43:28.119
MATT: Shit, you're right.

00:43:28.119 --> 00:43:29.631
TALIESIN: There might be a backup plan.

00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:31.436
SAM: What, you know something we don't?

00:43:31.436 --> 00:43:44.667
TALIESIN: Maybe on the outskirts of town there's a
place where about three or four nice beehives not

00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:50.960
too high up in the tree, close enough to a running
body of water that we throw it in there, run away

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.978
really quick and then we go in for a little bit of
honey.

00:43:53.978 --> 00:43:55.672
LIAM: Waffle is the brains.

00:43:55.672 --> 00:43:58.049
MATT: I can tell that. All right, lead us on,
Waffle.

00:43:58.049 --> 00:44:02.963
MARISHA: Roll twice, take the lower for brains for
criminal to track down this place. You feel like

00:44:02.963 --> 00:44:04.256
you remember--

00:44:04.256 --> 00:44:05.537
TALIESIN: I fail.

00:44:05.537 --> 00:44:07.033
MARISHA: You fail, you don't remember where this
honey is.

00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:08.651
TALIESIN: I don't remember where it is, but it was
very--

00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:10.622
SAM: That's our brains.

00:44:10.622 --> 00:44:13.079
LIAM: It's a good idea. Implementation is
everything.

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:19.064
MARISHA: You guys take a few hours, walking the
edge of the rivers.

00:44:19.064 --> 00:44:21.901
MATT: You had five bear and you failed?

00:44:21.901 --> 00:44:26.415
TALIESIN: Yeah. I was bear, and it was criminal.

00:44:26.415 --> 00:44:31.982
MARISHA: He was rolling for criminal, and you
failed, so you should-- did you go-- when your

00:44:31.982 --> 00:44:37.171
plan fails and you run into difficulty, you move
one point from criminal into bear. You didn't

00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:38.352
really run into difficulty.

00:44:38.352 --> 00:44:40.275
TALIESIN: I didn't run into difficulty. I
attempted a flashback, basically.

00:44:40.275 --> 00:44:42.587
MARISHA: That's true.

00:44:42.587 --> 00:44:44.473
TALIESIN: That was actually what I was trying to
do.

00:44:44.473 --> 00:44:48.656
MARISHA: Do you want to voluntarily move a point.
Is that what you're wanting to do?

00:44:48.656 --> 00:44:50.376
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was what I was trying to do.

00:44:50.376 --> 00:44:56.742
MARISHA: Okay, go ahead and move a point. But
unfortunately, I'd say you don't quite remember

00:44:56.742 --> 00:44:58.713
where these beehives are.

00:44:58.713 --> 00:45:01.290
TALIESIN: If only we could find those beehives.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.929
MARISHA: If anyone else wants to search?

00:45:03.929 --> 00:45:06.499
TALIESIN: Oh god, bears can't-- Can bears look up?
Maybe that's part of the problem.

00:45:06.499 --> 00:45:15.537
LIAM: All right, so the bakery is a bust. Waffle
can't remember the honey spot. What about this

00:45:15.537 --> 00:45:19.524
castle you live in? They don't got a pantry or a
kitchen or nothing?

00:45:19.524 --> 00:45:24.477
MATT: I can certainly try.

00:45:24.477 --> 00:45:27.960
SAM: Want us to come with you?

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:33.812
MATT: Best make this a quick in-and-out. They know
me-- I don't want to cause any ruckus.

00:45:33.812 --> 00:45:39.013
SAM: How do we know that you're not going to keep
the good stuff yourself and give us the dregs?

00:45:39.013 --> 00:45:42.267
I'd feel more comfortable if one of us went
with you.

00:45:42.267 --> 00:45:44.382
MATT: All right, who do you want it to be?

00:45:44.586 --> 00:45:49.446
SAM: Definitely the brains of the operation.

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:56.260
MATT: All right, Waffle. Come on, let's go. As me
and Waffle make our way to Whitestone--

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.545
MARISHA: Okay, it probably takes you about 45
minutes now-- since you guys had walked a

00:45:59.545 --> 00:46:08.592
little bit up the river looking for these-- to get
back. The guards stop you. "Who's this guy?"

00:46:08.592 --> 00:46:11.714
MATT: (bear grunts)

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.122
MARISHA: "All right."

00:46:13.122 --> 00:46:14.434
TALIESIN: What he said.

00:46:14.434 --> 00:46:24.446
MARISHA: He steps out of the way. You go in, you
look around, you go to the pantry. It's pretty

00:46:24.446 --> 00:46:30.930
easy-- you only find two jars. There's not a
lot there. But I'd say there's two uses.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.738
MATT: That's helpful.

00:46:32.982 --> 00:46:36.146
MARISHA: You gather your stuff-- anything else?

00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:45.886
MATT: Anything else you want to prepare with? Slim
pickings. Mama took it all with her.

00:46:46.083 --> 00:46:51.195
TALIESIN: They always leave something. I want to
rifle through the entire kitchen-- just through

00:46:51.195 --> 00:46:59.230
everything. I want to go through every drawer,
empty it onto the floor, and see what's there.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:04.554
MARISHA: Roll for-- what is searching? Is
searching for bear?

00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:07.381
TALIESIN: It's not searching. I want to roll the
place like a bear.

00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.370
MARISHA: Like a bear? Then roll for bear.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.501
TALIESIN: All right. Success.

00:47:12.501 --> 00:47:16.095
MARISHA: You destroy the kitchen.

00:47:16.095 --> 00:47:20.381
TALIESIN: Do I find anything? I was looking for
some silverware, maybe some napkins.

00:47:20.381 --> 00:47:27.176
MARISHA: You knock over a coat rack-- one of those
freestanding coat racks that was standing.

00:47:27.176 --> 00:47:28.580
TALIESIN: Who put that in the kitchen. That was
such a bad idea.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.855
MARISHA: Yeah, it was a pretty bad idea. It falls
over and this big, long trenchcoat falls over you.

00:47:33.855 --> 00:47:37.907
And you go, "Eh, might be useful. I don't know."

00:47:38.368 --> 00:47:42.249
SAM: Trenchcoat of invisibility.

00:47:42.249 --> 00:47:46.907
MATT: I'm going to go pick up some more thieves
tools from the kitchen. Like a meat tenderizer and

00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:49.723
a turkey platter.

00:47:49.723 --> 00:47:50.855
SAM: A melon baller?

00:47:50.855 --> 00:47:55.185
BRIAN: Does this house perhaps have a wine
cellar?

00:47:55.185 --> 00:47:57.008
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:47:57.008 --> 00:47:58.694
BRIAN: I'm going to go down there for a little
bit.

00:47:58.694 --> 00:48:00.548
SAM: You're not in there. You're outside.

00:48:00.548 --> 00:48:03.897
MARISHA: The brains is there.

00:48:04.377 --> 00:48:06.295
SAM: He's the brains.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.683
BRIAN: But I can dig into the wine cellar.

00:48:07.683 --> 00:48:08.732
SAM: You're going to break into the castle?

00:48:08.732 --> 00:48:11.343
BRIAN: No, it's fine. I'm thirsty.

00:48:11.343 --> 00:48:20.010
MARISHA: Okay, you guys gather your stuff, you
meet the rest of the Sweet Brothers at the edge of

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:28.859
the forest, and you slowly start making your way
towards the 1,972-Acre Woods. It's a little bit of

00:48:28.859 --> 00:48:36.015
a trek-- it takes you the rest of the evening. By
the time that you get there, the sun is rising.

00:48:36.015 --> 00:48:39.320
Wait for it.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.571
SAM: Waiting.

00:48:40.597 --> 00:48:45.226
ALL: Wait.

00:48:45.226 --> 00:48:46.855
[classical music]

00:48:46.855 --> 00:48:51.894
MARISHA: As you the approach this clearing in the
woods, you can hear soft music in the distance.

00:48:51.917 --> 00:48:59.996
A string quartet. Rich smells of cured meats and
cheeses waft past your nose that are immediately

00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:08.129
counterbalanced with saccharine sweet maple, honey,
and cinnamon scents, as well as the very coveted--

00:49:08.129 --> 00:49:09.469
BRIAN: Meats.

00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:10.569
SAM: Smell it.

00:49:10.569 --> 00:49:11.811
MATT: No. Hold it in.

00:49:11.811 --> 00:49:12.885
BRIAN: Resist brother.

00:49:12.885 --> 00:49:14.390
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:20.693
MARISHA: You can tell this is coveted grade-A
honey. This isn't the cheap shit. Following where

00:49:20.693 --> 00:49:25.916
your senses are leading you, you all begin to see
blush-colored roses and wild daisies draping from

00:49:25.916 --> 00:49:33.347
nearby trees. An old and opulent brick and wooden
manor reveals itself in the dense forest treeline.

00:49:33.347 --> 00:49:39.793
And the full picture starts becoming a little bit
more clear. A beautiful courtyard gated in

00:49:39.793 --> 00:49:46.034
iron-wrought fencing is spotted with several
tables being dressed with tablecloths and matching

00:49:46.034 --> 00:49:52.527
floral centerpieces to the rose and daisy garlands
you saw upon entering. Several bears in aprons

00:49:52.527 --> 00:49:56.300
skitter around as they set up for what appears to
be a wedding.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.588
LIAM: Bears?

00:49:57.588 --> 00:49:59.595
MARISHA: Server bears.

00:49:59.595 --> 00:50:00.903
LIAM: Ooh!

00:50:00.903 --> 00:50:02.657
SAM: Server bears.

00:50:02.657 --> 00:50:06.649
MARISHA: They're bears. A dessert table is
being adorned with honey cakes,

00:50:06.649 --> 00:50:13.642
the bar has copper mugs with bamboo stir
sticks being placed. You all have made it to

00:50:13.642 --> 00:50:15.739
Vinnie the Pooh's manor.

00:50:15.739 --> 00:50:18.005
BRIAN: Wow.

00:50:18.005 --> 00:50:20.276
MATT: Is this how other bears live?

00:50:20.276 --> 00:50:22.254
SAM: It's a little piece of heaven.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.843
TALIESIN: Sweet digs.

00:50:23.843 --> 00:50:26.860
MATT: This is what happens when all of the
Whitestone tax cuts go to the one

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.651
percent bears. Just pisses me off.

00:50:29.651 --> 00:50:32.747
SAM: Hey, let's not talk politics, let's just
do the job.

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.891
MATT: You're right; I'm sorry.

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:39.024
BRIAN: This is why these guys paid me in 
margarine instead of honey.

00:50:39.067 --> 00:50:41.552
LIAM: I can't believe it's not butter!

00:50:41.588 --> 00:50:50.966
BRIAN: Maybe it is. My cholesterol says otherwise.
Well, I know this guy. If we want to try to go

00:50:50.966 --> 00:50:56.490
directly in, I could maybe knock on the door and
work my old Las Vegas charm.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:00.152
MATT: I trust him. He's never let us down before.

00:51:00.152 --> 00:51:01.873
SAM: No, what could go wrong?

00:51:01.873 --> 00:51:04.114
LIAM: Send in the muscle.

00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:06.197
SAM: Do you need any backup?

00:51:06.197 --> 00:51:11.788
BRIAN: Who's the least douchebaggy
looking of us out of the group, besides me?

00:51:11.994 --> 00:51:13.236
TALIESIN: Cookie.

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.330
LIAM: Well, I am the fuckin' face of this party.

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:16.789
BRIAN: You want to come with me?

00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:18.331
LIAM: Hell yeah!

00:51:18.331 --> 00:51:21.077
BRIAN: Worst comes to worst, we can seduce 
one of the server bears.

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:23.814
SAM: Now, with those two hats on, you sure

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:26.267
it won't look like you're trying to sell bibles or
something?

00:51:26.267 --> 00:51:30.730
LIAM: I mean, there's nothing wrong with a
little side venture.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:37.591
BRIAN. We'll tell them it's magazines. Yeah,
let's go up and knock on the door.

00:51:37.591 --> 00:51:41.926
MARISHA: Okay. Liam Las Vegas and Cookie--

00:51:41.926 --> 00:51:43.283
LIAM: Still confusing to me.

00:51:43.283 --> 00:51:46.869
BRIAN: I did it for you, baby.

00:51:46.869 --> 00:51:54.813
MARISHA: Opulent, very Victorian sitting room.
As you walk in, you go up the stairs that are

00:51:54.813 --> 00:52:03.153
red-carpeted. Opulent paintings on the side of
the wall. You know where Vinnie's office is. You

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:09.749
go down a long hallway-- at the end with the
giant, double oak doors. As you all approach,

00:52:09.749 --> 00:52:15.301
you see another man with dark, slicked-back
hair in a suit come out.

00:52:15.301 --> 00:52:16.835
SAM: A man?

00:52:16.835 --> 00:52:18.780
MARISHA: Bear man.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.413
MATT: Bearman. Steve Bearman.

00:52:22.413 --> 00:52:24.829
BRIAN: 'Sup, Steve?

00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:26.765
MARISHA: "Liam."

00:52:26.765 --> 00:52:29.923
BRIAN: Hey.

00:52:29.923 --> 00:52:31.490
MARISHA: "Didn't expect to see you coming around
here."

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:33.017
BRIAN: Most people don't.

00:52:33.017 --> 00:52:36.114
MARISHA: "Boss is in an interesting mood."

00:52:36.114 --> 00:52:38.790
BRIAN: Mind if we talk to him for a minute?

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.070
MARISHA: "Go on in."

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:42.636
BRIAN: All right. Let's go.

00:52:42.636 --> 00:52:49.927
MARISHA: You open the door and you, in the
dark, heavily-lit, with only a window coming through,

00:52:49.927 --> 00:53:00.219
see a portly, golden-brown-furred bear with thick,
black hair, slicked back, and a thin pencil mustache.

00:53:00.219 --> 00:53:03.437
LIAM: Over fur.

00:53:03.437 --> 00:53:04.826
SAM: On his fur?

00:53:04.826 --> 00:53:07.291
MARISHA: On his fur.

00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:10.727
(laughter)

00:53:10.727 --> 00:53:12.574
SAM: Wow.

00:53:12.574 --> 00:53:14.416
MARISHA: "Ah, Liam."

00:53:14.416 --> 00:53:15.969
BRIAN: Vinnie!

00:53:15.969 --> 00:53:17.134
MARISHA: "Liam Las Vegas."

00:53:17.134 --> 00:53:22.397
BRIAN: How you doing, my man? That 'stache is
looking mighty pencil.

00:53:22.397 --> 00:53:27.837
(laughter)

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:29.000
SAM: You got this.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.253
BRIAN: Maintain.

00:53:31.253 --> 00:53:33.318
LIAM: Hey, hey. This is serious.

00:53:33.318 --> 00:53:35.973
MATT: (shushes)

00:53:35.973 --> 00:53:38.594
MARISHA: "It's been a long time since I've seen
you."

00:53:38.594 --> 00:53:43.234
BRIAN: It has, it has. It has. How are the kids?

00:53:43.234 --> 00:53:47.422
MARISHA: "They're doing okay. You know, my
daughter, she's getting married today."

00:53:47.422 --> 00:53:51.053
BRIAN: Is that what all that hullabaloo is
about outside?

00:53:51.053 --> 00:53:55.787
MARISHA: "It's interesting for you to come
here on the day my daughter is to be married."

00:53:55.787 --> 00:54:01.304
BRIAN: Well it's a bit of a coincidence, because
I was in the neighborhood, looking for cakes,

00:54:01.581 --> 00:54:03.283
and boom. You guys got cakes downstairs.

00:54:03.283 --> 00:54:04.390
MARISHA: "Interesting."

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:06.294
BRIAN: My nose led me back to you, Vinnie.

00:54:06.294 --> 00:54:11.188
MARISHA: "You know, that's hard to believe,
seeing as you don't even come by anymore.

00:54:11.188 --> 00:54:17.394
"Don't even stop in for coffee. You don't even have
the respect to call me The Pooh."

00:54:17.394 --> 00:54:19.437
BRIAN: Look.

00:54:19.437 --> 00:54:21.111
MARISHA: "You know, what do you want, Liam?"

00:54:21.111 --> 00:54:26.630
BRIAN: The Pooh, I have been lost in the
woods with my friends for a ittle bit.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:33.772
We decided to take a trip out there, somewhere
near a place called Hoshua Tree, and

00:54:33.772 --> 00:54:39.830
find ourselves over again, you know what I
mean? Take a little time. Every once in a

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:43.922
while, you got to do a reassessment, you know? So
we went out there, tripped out a little bit.

00:54:43.922 --> 00:54:48.118
Anyway, we came across some information that I
think you might find interesting.

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:53.315
MARISHA: "Well, that's very interesting. It's interesting
that you think you have more information

00:54:53.315 --> 00:54:55.505
"than The Pooh, you know?"

00:54:55.505 --> 00:54:56.935
BRIAN: Well I--

00:54:56.935 --> 00:55:00.522
MARISHA: "Is that why you're here with this
other wise guy? You think you can

00:55:00.522 --> 00:55:04.381
"do better than me? You think he knows more
than Vinnie?"

00:55:04.381 --> 00:55:06.192
BRIAN: No, we would never assume something like
that.

00:55:06.192 --> 00:55:08.269
LIAM: Mr. The Pooh, If I may--

00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:10.511
MARISHA: "Call me Vinnie the Pooh."

00:55:10.511 --> 00:55:12.560
LIAM: Vinnie the Pooh? Oh, well--

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.754
MARISHA: "I don't know you. You know, you don't
give me respect yet."

00:55:16.754 --> 00:55:23.762
LIAM: Trust me, we give you the utmost respect on
this, your daughter's wedding day.

00:55:23.762 --> 00:55:25.932
(laughter)

00:55:25.932 --> 00:55:27.653
MARISHA: "It's a very blessed day."

00:55:27.653 --> 00:55:35.387
LIAM: It is indeed. And you are known far and wide
across the Hundred Acres and beyond. We have come--

00:55:35.387 --> 00:55:38.011
BRIAN: (whispering) 1,972 acres.

00:55:38.011 --> 00:55:42.190
LIAM: I meant no disrespect.

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:49.555
MARISHA: "I worked very hard for those extra nine
hundred and-- one thousand-- I worked very hard

00:55:49.555 --> 00:55:50.922
"for those other acres."

00:55:50.922 --> 00:55:55.208
(laughter)

00:55:55.208 --> 00:55:58.552
LIAM: What did we come here for?

00:55:58.857 --> 00:56:01.600
BRIAN: We-- Listen.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.309
(laughter)

00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:05.524
SAM: I don't know!

00:56:05.524 --> 00:56:13.512
MATT: Well, they-- (cooing) Vinnie was working
with the ninjas.

00:56:13.512 --> 00:56:18.026
BRIAN: Vinnie? Do you want me to tell you what
I know? Or what seems like it would be more

00:56:18.026 --> 00:56:24.707
respectful is A, I were to remove my hat and
B, you could tell us what you know

00:56:24.841 --> 00:56:27.788
and then we could maybe add or take away from it.

00:56:27.788 --> 00:56:35.475
MARISHA: "You know, you have a very good point,
Liam Las Vegas. I'm sorry to be so testy. Tell me

00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:37.515
"what you know. What can I do for you?"

00:56:37.515 --> 00:56:44.085
BRIAN: Well, a few months back, you remember,
actually one of the last jobs I ended up doing for

00:56:44.085 --> 00:56:51.850
you; we were moving something. And I was driving,
of course, because I'm great at it, and--

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:54.047
MARISHA: "One of the best."

00:56:54.047 --> 00:56:59.391
BRIAN: Thank you. We were being escorted by some
ninjas. Some ninja bears. Do you remember them?

00:56:59.391 --> 00:57:01.871
MARISHA: "You're talking about the Bear Acuda."

00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:03.333
BRIAN: Yeah.

00:57:03.333 --> 00:57:04.419
MARISHA: "Yeah."

00:57:04.419 --> 00:57:13.280
BRIAN. Chupacabra. And come to find out, there's
this guy, Hattori Bongo. You heard of him?

00:57:13.325 --> 00:57:17.602
MARISHA: "Yeah, I know Hattori Bongo. He did me
dirty."

00:57:17.835 --> 00:57:19.844
BRIAN: How'd he do you dirty?

00:57:19.844 --> 00:57:27.673
MARISHA: "Well you know, on top of moving all the
honey, he also controls the underground

00:57:27.673 --> 00:57:30.704
"Xhorhasian smoked salmon smuggling grounds."

00:57:30.704 --> 00:57:32.597
BRIAN: Oh, shit!

00:57:32.597 --> 00:57:37.431
MARISHA: "I actually ordered a bunch of salmon
from him for my daughter's wedding, and it hasn't

00:57:37.431 --> 00:57:38.954
"showed up yet."

00:57:38.954 --> 00:57:41.202
BRIAN: Because they're hoarding all of it.

00:57:41.202 --> 00:57:43.094
MARISHA: "It's been a little delayed, I don't know
why."

00:57:43.094 --> 00:57:47.085
BRIAN: Word is he's held up over at Fort Lox.

00:57:47.085 --> 00:57:51.122
MARISHA: "I heard something like that too. I
didn't know if it was true."

00:57:51.122 --> 00:57:57.221
BRIAN: I think he's trying to make it his POO.
Point Of Operation.

00:57:57.221 --> 00:58:02.461
MARISHA: "I don't like that, there's only one
Pooh."

00:58:02.461 --> 00:58:08.546
BRIAN: And that's you, my friend. Do you know how
we could get into Fort Lox by any chance?

00:58:08.546 --> 00:58:11.837
LIAM: You cannot let this Heffalump maneuver
stand.

00:58:11.837 --> 00:58:20.858
MARISHA: "Look, you know I like you, Liam, but
you're not necessarily part of the family. And you--"

00:58:20.858 --> 00:58:22.771
BRIAN: I'm not part of anybody's family.

00:58:22.771 --> 00:58:30.945
MARISHA: "And I don't know you. So look: I'll tell
you something. You go up, you go check in on my

00:58:30.945 --> 00:58:36.929
"smugglers that are trying to bring in the
Xhorhasian smoked salmon, you find out what's

00:58:36.929 --> 00:58:44.362
"going on, you come back, let me know I can trust
you, and then maybe I'll give you the information.

00:58:44.362 --> 00:58:52.069
"You know, you can't just come in here and ask
me to be a snitch. You know that's not Vinnie."

00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:55.878
LIAM: No, of course. A favor for a favor.

00:58:55.878 --> 00:59:00.116
BRIAN: Just a favor, that's all we're asking.
You'll like him, trust me.

00:59:00.116 --> 00:59:07.415
MARISHA: "All right. The wedding ceremony starts
in about three hours."

00:59:07.415 --> 00:59:10.049
BRIAN: Where do you think we will find these
smugglers?

00:59:10.049 --> 00:59:18.433
MARISHA: "Well, I sent them northeast. Up on the
path just right behind the house. I expected them

00:59:18.433 --> 00:59:24.608
"to be back around four hours ago. That's the path
that leads straight up to Fort Lox."

00:59:24.608 --> 00:59:26.731
BRIAN: The same path.

00:59:26.731 --> 00:59:28.319
MARISHA: "The same path."

00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:29.574
BRIAN: Excellent.

00:59:29.574 --> 00:59:35.297
MARISHA: "See what you can find, and then we'll
talk, okay?"

00:59:35.297 --> 00:59:36.671
BRIAN: All right.

00:59:36.671 --> 00:59:38.047
MARISHA: "Kiss the rings."

00:59:38.047 --> 00:59:44.300
BRIAN: Fucking (grumbling) piece of shit. Listen,
do you need anybody to taste the wine before the

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.204
wedding to make sure everything is good before we
go? I mean, we got a little bit of time.

00:59:47.204 --> 00:59:50.058
MARISHA: "Oh, I like you. I like this guy."

00:59:50.058 --> 00:59:52.069
BRIAN: I'm just kidding.

00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:56.450
MARISHA: "You know, how about this? You go get
yourself one of our premium honey cocktails.

00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:03.194
"Themed after the bride and groom, you know these
weddings these days. And get yourself one for the

01:00:03.194 --> 01:00:04.585
road, all right?"

01:00:04.585 --> 01:00:05.950
BRIAN: Will do.

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:07.305
MARISHA: "Okay."

01:00:07.305 --> 01:00:09.206
BRIAN: All right, I'm going to go back down to--

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:14.929
MARISHA: Okay. You go back down and you are
chilling in the courtyard.

01:00:14.929 --> 01:00:16.565
BRIAN: Are you guys there?

01:00:16.565 --> 01:00:18.437
MARISHA: Feel free to go get--

01:00:18.437 --> 01:00:22.486
MATT: We don't want to get too close to the
wedding, because we're not invited. So we're

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:25.584
going to stay on the outskirts, looking in until
they exit.

01:00:25.584 --> 01:00:31.827
MARISHA: The guests haven't arrived. It's very
much still getting set up, so you can go in if you

01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:39.664
want. When Liam Las Vegas and Cookie-- this is
very confusing-- come back down, you let him

01:00:39.664 --> 01:00:45.913
know that you can go in and get a cocktail,
get some honey, get some bamboo. You're

01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:47.541
welcome to it, if you would like.

01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:49.182
BRIAN and MATT: Yes.

01:00:49.182 --> 01:00:55.593
SAM: Ugh, I just finished throwing up in the corner.
I'm going to need some bamboo pretty soon.

01:00:55.593 --> 01:00:59.808
BRIAN: Well, look. They've got treats, and they've
got drinks for us here.

01:00:59.808 --> 01:01:01.577
TALIESIN: I'm definitely going to try a signature
cocktail.

01:01:01.577 --> 01:01:04.018
BRIAN: I will drink six or seven honey cocktails
if I can.

01:01:04.018 --> 01:01:07.500
LIAM: Yeah, is it open bar, or is it a drink ticket
situation, or what are we talking about here?

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:14.361
MARISHA: You have the good graces of The Pooh, so
it's not open bar. But you can have enough, if you

01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:19.836
would like to move a point from criminal onto
bear, you are more than welcome to do that.

01:01:19.836 --> 01:01:22.547
MATT: I'm going to pocket some bamboo
just in case.

01:01:22.547 --> 01:01:24.160
MARISHA: Feel free to pocket bamboo.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.064
MATT: Just to have it there. I'm going to not take
any of the meals as I'm not feeling the honey in

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:31.709
the belly at the moment, but I go ahead and pocket
some of that--

01:01:31.709 --> 01:01:33.112
MARISHA: Some honey?

01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:36.908
MATT: More than necessary using my thief skill if
need be, I don't want to draw any attention.

01:01:36.908 --> 01:01:38.355
MARISHA: Okay.

01:01:38.355 --> 01:01:40.020
TALIESIN: I put a honey cake in my hat for later.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.866
MARISHA: Okay. Go ahead and roll for criminal.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.402
MATT: That's a success with a one.

01:01:44.402 --> 01:01:48.895
MARISHA: You take another two servings or so of
honey. You can use them for the cocktail.

01:01:48.895 --> 01:01:53.070
BRIAN: I'll fill them in on what we learned upstairs
while we're drinking and eating and stuff.

01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:56.129
SAM: I'm going to ask the bartender if I can have
an ice bucket filled halfway with honey and then

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.414
stuffed full of bamboo stirring sticks.

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:05.019
MARISHA: Looks at you oddly and then goes,
"Yeah, okay," and hands it over.

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:09.401
SAM: I'm going to go crazy on the bamboo and hang
back on the honey.

01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:12.544
MARISHA: Okay, feel free. So make your move.

01:02:12.544 --> 01:02:13.657
SAM: May I take a point of bear?

01:02:13.657 --> 01:02:20.122
MARISHA: You can move a point from criminal into
bear.

01:02:20.122 --> 01:02:22.277
SAM: If I want to?

01:02:22.277 --> 01:02:23.346
MARISHA: If you want to.

01:02:23.346 --> 01:02:24.821
SAM: I will stick with what my current--

01:02:24.821 --> 01:02:26.474
MARISHA: Okay, you pocket a few sticks for later.

01:02:26.474 --> 01:02:31.426
LIAM: I would like to talk up one of the
beartenders, a lady beartender, and see if I can

01:02:31.426 --> 01:02:33.875
get myself an extra dose of honey.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:40.717
MARISHA: Oh. Okay. You walk up, and she's busy
and she's setting the table. "Yes, what? Can I help you?

01:02:40.717 --> 01:02:42.098
LIAM: Hey, hey.

01:02:42.098 --> 01:02:43.123
MARISHA: "Hi."

01:02:43.123 --> 01:02:46.657
LIAM: I'm about to go on the road with some
friends, and I'm also in the mood to get a little

01:02:46.657 --> 01:02:50.958
extra honey. I know I've already had my share,
but, maybe in exchange, I happen to be a pretty

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:53.713
well-known bear. I go by the the name of Trinket.

01:02:53.713 --> 01:02:55.882
MARISHA: "Oh, really?"

01:02:55.882 --> 01:03:00.825
LIAM: I reside in Whitestone itself. What's her
name, Lady Vix'squalia is--

01:03:00.825 --> 01:03:11.322
MARISHA: "<i>The</i> Whitestone and Vix'squalia? Oh my
god. What's it like living in a castle?"

01:03:11.322 --> 01:03:16.722
LIAM: Well, you know, they do nothing but give you
honey all day, everything's made out of honeycomb,

01:03:16.722 --> 01:03:21.857
and lots of people scratch your fur and your butt
and stuff all day.

01:03:21.857 --> 01:03:23.790
MARISHA: "That sounds pretty nice."

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:30.682
LIAM: Yeah. Look, I got to get out of here pretty
quick, but you are welcome to come over and visit

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.832
Whitestone anytime you want.

01:03:32.832 --> 01:03:34.110
MARISHA: "Really?"

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.349
LIAM: Yeah.

01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:40.422
MARISHA: "Well, who do I say when I-- who
requested me when I show up?"

01:03:40.422 --> 01:03:42.178
LIAM: You just ask for Trinket and you say--

01:03:42.178 --> 01:03:43.677
MARISHA: "Ask for Trinket."

01:03:43.677 --> 01:03:46.196
LIAM: "It's high noon," you're in like that.

01:03:46.196 --> 01:03:53.272
MARISHA: "It's high noon." She makes a note and
she slips you another jar of honey just for yourself.

01:03:53.272 --> 01:03:55.462
SAM: So slick.

01:03:55.462 --> 01:03:58.223
TALIESIN: (cackling)

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:00.221
LIAM: I couldn't look over until I finished it!

01:04:00.221 --> 01:04:06.149
BRIAN: The body temperature has just-- It's
burning my coat now.

01:04:06.149 --> 01:04:08.885
TALIESIN: Hey, we've got the AC working again.

01:04:08.885 --> 01:04:18.110
SAM: On the way out from the setup, I'm going to
do a scan around. Are there any servers pushing

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:21.960
any carts of any sort, like with plates or
anything on them?

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:34.017
MARISHA: Actually, the woman who Cookie was just
talking to was moving over champagne glasses,

01:04:34.017 --> 01:04:39.192
placing them onto the table, and they're behind
her a little bit. She's distracted. It's an

01:04:39.192 --> 01:04:40.715
unattended drink cart.

01:04:40.715 --> 01:04:43.535
SAM: I would like to try to steal the unattended
drink cart.

01:04:43.535 --> 01:04:48.495
MARISHA: Okay, roll for criminal. Roll twice
because you're the driver.

01:04:48.495 --> 01:04:49.789
SAM: What? Oh, because I'm a driver.

01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:51.075
MARISHA: Take the lower.

01:04:51.075 --> 01:04:52.493
SAM: I'll take the lower, and that's a success.

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:58.460
MARISHA: You slowly (creaking) pull it away.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.979
SAM: Do I move one point over, then?

01:05:01.979 --> 01:05:03.347
MATT: For a success, you move over to criminal.

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:04.780
SAM: Okay, cool.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:10.218
MARISHA: You all meet out front of Vinnie the
Pooh's house.

01:05:10.218 --> 01:05:18.989
SAM: That could not have gone better. We got a
little information, we got a little mobilization.

01:05:18.989 --> 01:05:20.650
TALIESIN: A little honey for later.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:25.581
LIAM: This is why I don't understand why we are
not a permanent team, Trink. I mean, we work

01:05:25.581 --> 01:05:29.242
together well. I'm sure your people are nice, but
come on!

01:05:29.242 --> 01:05:36.577
MATT: Look, this goes well, maybe there's a
possibility we can keep working. Maybe under the

01:05:36.577 --> 01:05:43.663
banner of these people I stay with. They're mostly
retired at this point anyway, so we'll talk about

01:05:43.663 --> 01:05:48.410
it. We'll talk about it at the end. I like working
with you, but I got a family. I'm a family man.

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:49.754
BRIAN: What's that like?

01:05:49.754 --> 01:05:51.908
MATT: It's the greatest thing that's ever happened
to me.

01:05:51.908 --> 01:05:54.379
BRIAN: Eh, sounds terrible.

01:05:54.379 --> 01:05:57.953
SAM: You don't need all those riches and luxury.
You just need the bare necessities.

01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:00.358
BRIAN: (sighs)

01:06:00.358 --> 01:06:02.401
MATT: Anyway.

01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:07.593
(laughter)

01:06:07.593 --> 01:06:10.206
MATT: All right, we got stocked up, we got some
information.

01:06:10.206 --> 01:06:16.440
BRIAN: Yeah, and I also pocketed some booze for
the road. Some honey booze for the road.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.446
SAM: We're going to go get these smugglers?

01:06:19.446 --> 01:06:21.136
MATT: Let's do it.

01:06:21.136 --> 01:06:22.952
TALIESIN: Let's head up the trail.

01:06:22.952 --> 01:06:24.815
MARISHA: You're all going northeast?

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:27.694
BRIAN: Let's hop on this drink cart.

01:06:27.694 --> 01:06:29.061
MARISHA: You hop on the drink cart!

01:06:29.061 --> 01:06:32.033
SAM: I can fit one of you, maybe.

01:06:32.199 --> 01:06:33.660
TALIESIN: We all hop on the drink cart.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:42.219
MARISHA: You all hop on the drink cart. It's a
comedic scene, it looks like a clown car,

01:06:42.219 --> 01:06:49.596
but it's a bear car, and right on top of that
pyramid is Liam Las Vegas surfing on the

01:06:49.681 --> 01:06:53.727
shoulders, poor Peddy pushing behind.

01:06:53.727 --> 01:06:59.311
SAM: What? We all have four legs, we can walk much
faster than this.

01:06:59.311 --> 01:07:03.466
MARISHA: It's true. You don't necessarily travel
any faster.

01:07:03.466 --> 01:07:13.117
SAM: These small wheels do not do well on
this dirt path. This is very inefficient!

01:07:13.117 --> 01:07:23.019
MARISHA: After not too long, maybe two hours,
you start to head to the edge of the woods,

01:07:23.104 --> 01:07:32.595
and you get to a clearing that's opening up. You
can actually see in the very far distance stone

01:07:32.595 --> 01:07:41.789
fort walls. As you head up, you start to hear
some shouting and arguing in the distance.

01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:44.100
Sounds like an altercation.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.593
SAM: In bear or in human?

01:07:46.593 --> 01:07:47.802
MARISHA: In bear.

01:07:47.802 --> 01:07:50.456
MATT: One paw up.

01:07:50.456 --> 01:07:56.370
SAM: Everybody stop. Oh wait, I'm pushing. I'll
stop.

01:07:56.370 --> 01:08:04.257
MARISHA: As you all get quiet, you hear, "Look,
man! If you're not with us, then that means you

01:08:04.257 --> 01:08:16.236
"must be against us, all right? Come on!" You see
the outline of three polar bears, and beyond that,

01:08:16.236 --> 01:08:20.232
Vinnie the Pooh's guys and a cart.

01:08:20.232 --> 01:08:28.768
BRIAN: I know those guys! Not the polar ones, the
polar opposites.

01:08:28.918 --> 01:08:34.306
MARISHA: "You know, man? You don't want to sign a
petition, you don't want to hear us out, you don't

01:08:34.306 --> 01:08:37.097
"want to play our game. You know, it's just not
fair!"

01:08:37.097 --> 01:08:38.303
BRIAN: How far are we from them?

01:08:38.303 --> 01:08:39.706
MARISHA: A hundred yards.

01:08:39.706 --> 01:08:41.545
SAM: Who's talking, the polar bears?

01:08:41.545 --> 01:08:46.707
MARISHA: The polar bears, and you can hear Vinnie
the Pooh's guys being like, "Look, we just want to

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:51.084
"cross. We're in a hurry, we don't want to take
your survey, and we don't want to donate any

01:08:51.084 --> 01:08:52.655
"money. We don't care."

01:08:52.655 --> 01:08:53.834
BRIAN: Hey.

01:08:53.834 --> 01:08:57.151
MARISHA: Everyone stops and turns around.

01:08:57.151 --> 01:08:58.883
BRIAN: What's up, fellas?

01:08:58.883 --> 01:09:04.018
MARISHA: "Oh hey. Hey! Do you guys have a minute
to talk to the Polar Rising?"

01:09:04.018 --> 01:09:09.381
BRIAN: Nobody gives a shit. Listen, stop harassing
these guys and let them go.

01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:17.109
MARISHA: "No, you know what, man? We're the ones
being harassed. All the time! No one wants to sit

01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:19.170
"here, no one cares about the polar bears."

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:22.702
BRIAN: I need you to stop moving that clipboard
around in a threatening way.

01:09:22.702 --> 01:09:29.505
MARISHA: "Look, I'm sorry, we're just really
passionate about our cause. You know, we've been

01:09:29.505 --> 01:09:34.963
"trying to get the Polar Rising off the ground for
quite a while, and no one even wants to (stuttering)

01:09:34.963 --> 01:09:36.908
"talk and-- look, I can't even talk, I'm so upset."

01:09:36.908 --> 01:09:41.305
SAM: Hey, calm down. Listen, look at me. I'm
half you.

01:09:41.658 --> 01:09:45.134
MARISHA: "You do look like half us, like exactly
half. It's pretty cool, man.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.630
SAM: What is your cause about?

01:09:48.646 --> 01:09:51.531
MARISHA: "Brother from another mother."

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:57.706
SAM: Yeah. Pound it out. What is this cause of
yours that you're trying to convert people to do?

01:09:57.706 --> 01:10:03.490
MARISHA: "Look, we're just trying to raise
awareness that polar bears aren't weak. Okay? The

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:09.308
"media's always depicting us as these helpless
creatures stuck on this floating piece of frozen

01:10:09.308 --> 01:10:14.502
"water, and that makes us look weak, man. You know?
And then they want to talk about how we're not

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:20.093
"reproducing as much as we can be. Have you
ever tried having sex in the middle of fucking

01:10:20.093 --> 01:10:21.975
"frigid temperatures, man?"

01:10:21.975 --> 01:10:23.882
BRIAN: Yes. Absolutely.

01:10:23.883 --> 01:10:26.323
MARISHA: "It's hard, right?"

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:28.363
BRIAN: It stays hard too.

01:10:28.363 --> 01:10:31.878
MARISHA: "Your dick, it just doesn't work right
and I feel like--"

01:10:32.108 --> 01:10:33.361
BRIAN: Speak for yourself.

01:10:33.361 --> 01:10:38.482
MARISHA: "Everyone's criticizing our dicks, man."
Then the other guys go, "Yeah, stop criticizing

01:10:38.482 --> 01:10:42.434
"our dicks!" The other guy goes, "Yeah, stop
hammering on and criticizing our dicks!"

01:10:42.434 --> 01:10:48.071
SAM: You know, it's true. Every time I've heard
talk about polar bears, everyone insults their

01:10:48.071 --> 01:10:50.804
dicks. And it's not right!

01:10:50.804 --> 01:10:53.229
MATT: No, it's unfortunate. It's not right at
all.

01:10:53.229 --> 01:11:02.251
SAM: I mean, looking at your dick right now, it
seems just below average, but <i>just</i> below.

01:11:02.251 --> 01:11:05.387
MARISHA: "That's because it's not just below
freezing, man."

01:11:05.387 --> 01:11:07.097
LIAM: And even if, it still deserves attention.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:11.588
MARISHA: "Exactly. They're always hammering
this idea that our dicks just aren't good enough.

01:11:11.655 --> 01:11:13.618
"Just stop hammering our dicks!"

01:11:13.618 --> 01:11:17.676
MATT: Here's my question, young polar bear,
tiny-dick friends.

01:11:17.676 --> 01:11:20.104
MARISHA: "Call me Chief of Polar Rising."

01:11:20.104 --> 01:11:26.319
MATT: Chief. Chief, what are you hoping to
accomplish with these signatures? Who's going to

01:11:26.319 --> 01:11:28.530
see these and what's it going to change, is my
question.

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:33.631
MARISHA: "No, you're totally right, man. We
learned that a few months ago. Sitting here

01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:38.642
"collecting signatures, that didn't do nothing. The
High Bear Nation don't want to listen to our

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:44.850
"cause, Council of Tal'Dorei doesn't want to listen
our cause. It's a real problem, just getting

01:11:45.128 --> 01:11:51.353
"stuck on this floating frozen water shit. So we
thought maybe to bring awareness to our

01:11:51.769 --> 01:11:52.961
"problem, we'd make a game."

01:11:52.961 --> 01:11:55.524
BRIAN and SAM: A game?

01:11:55.524 --> 01:12:03.011
MARISHA: "Yeah, a game. Very politically-driven,
social awareness game. So all we're doing is,

01:12:03.011 --> 01:12:07.739
"we're out here, we're trying to have it
beta-tested; because we can't test it, because

01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:12.564
"we're alphas. So we're looking for betas to try
and test our game, give us some feedback."

01:12:12.564 --> 01:12:16.648
SAM: What kind of game is this, like a roleplaying
game, or a--

01:12:16.648 --> 01:12:18.652
MARISHA: "Well, you want to see it?"

01:12:18.652 --> 01:12:20.940
LIAM: Does this involve your dicks?

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.200
BRIAN: I don't want to be touching a lot of
dicks unless that's all I'm going to be doing

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.565
for the rest of the day.

01:12:25.565 --> 01:12:28.927
MARISHA: "Well look, if you'll just take a
look--"

01:12:28.927 --> 01:12:33.826
LIAM: Hey, whoa! I want a little explanation! Just
don't whip it out on us, all right?

01:12:33.826 --> 01:12:37.398
MARISHA: "Well, how else am I going to get the
game out of the box?"

01:12:37.398 --> 01:12:38.483
MATT: Oh.

01:12:38.483 --> 01:12:40.330
LIAM: Proceed.

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:44.205
MARISHA: "It's not a dick-in-a-box, it's a game-in-a-box!
See, you're hammering our dicks again."

01:12:44.205 --> 01:12:46.620
SAM: Sorry, that's insensitive of us.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:55.081
BRIAN: Listen, I think their campaign slogan
should be "I was in the pool." Show us this game,

01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:58.840
and if you let our friends get by with this--

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.261
SAM: Yeah, if you let our friends go by, we'll
play the game with you.

01:13:02.261 --> 01:13:04.743
BRIAN: We'll play the game if you let them go,
how about that? They don't need to play;

01:13:04.743 --> 01:13:06.029
they're not very good at games.

01:13:06.029 --> 01:13:07.118
MARISHA: "Is that true?"

01:13:07.118 --> 01:13:09.659
BRIAN: It's very true. They're terrible.

01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:14.279
MARISHA: "All right, I want respected opinions
here, you know? From educated people. These guys

01:13:14.309 --> 01:13:15.874
"don't even want to listen, you know?"

01:13:15.874 --> 01:13:19.087
LIAM: They're also very judgmental of penis size,
so you might want to send them on up the road.

01:13:19.087 --> 01:13:20.617
MARISHA: "That looks clear."

01:13:20.617 --> 01:13:25.649
MATT: I'm not going to lie, I've traveled with
these gentlemen for some time, and you won't find

01:13:25.649 --> 01:13:28.835
a better group of betas out here this side of
Tal'Dorei.

01:13:28.835 --> 01:13:35.043
MARISHA: "That's why we'll never go into alpha
testing with our game, only beta." All right, hang on.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:38.168
BRIAN: Alpha's been known to work sometimes.

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:39.842
SAM: So what's our angle here, guys?

01:13:39.842 --> 01:13:46.928
MARISHA: "So whoever breaks the polar bear off
the floating piece of water first wins.

01:13:46.928 --> 01:13:49.910
"But you can't hammer our dicks, okay?"

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:51.638
BRIAN: Oh my god.

01:13:51.638 --> 01:13:52.785
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:13:52.785 --> 01:13:54.624
SAM: What is happening right now?

01:13:54.624 --> 01:13:57.076
MARISHA: "You're playing Don't Break the Frozen
Water."

01:13:57.076 --> 01:13:58.834
MATT: But don't hammer any dicks.

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:07.411
MARISHA: "But you're not allowed to hammer the
dicks. The first team-- Sorry. We'll do team one and

01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:15.494
"team two. First team that makes the polar bear fall
into the frozen water and gives him a complex loses."

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:17.335
LIAM: We'll leave the dicks alone.

01:14:17.335 --> 01:14:18.746
MARISHA: "Well, you can't hammer the dicks."

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:20.145
LIAM: Can't hammer the dicks.

01:14:20.145 --> 01:14:21.925
MATT: What if a dick is hammered on its own?

01:14:21.925 --> 01:14:23.312
SAM: Yeah, what if a dick just falls?

01:14:23.312 --> 01:14:28.672
MARISHA: "No, if a dick falls, that's no one's
fault, and that's what we're trying to

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:34.932
"communicate. But if you hammer our dicks, you're
immediately disqualified, and you lose."

01:14:34.932 --> 01:14:37.419
LIAM: In gameplay terms, is there any way to get
the dick back up?

01:14:37.419 --> 01:14:44.748
MARISHA: "Unfortunately, no. Isn't it
depressing?"

01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:51.150
MATT: That's really unfortunate. I'm feeling for
your plight the more we have this conversation.

01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:53.318
LIAM: It's an age-old problem.

01:14:53.318 --> 01:14:56.384
MARISHA: "All right, who wants to go first?"

01:14:56.384 --> 01:14:58.426
MATT: To be fair, Peddy, from what I've heard,
some of your people have had a hard time with

01:14:58.607 --> 01:15:02.455
keeping their dicks up for a while too, right?

01:15:02.455 --> 01:15:03.947
SAM: It's true.

01:15:03.947 --> 01:15:05.502
MARISHA: "He's half polar bear, that's why."

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:07.313
MATT: I'm sorry, I don't want to-- anyway.

01:15:07.313 --> 01:15:09.842
TALIESIN: I'm going to start by not hammering one
of these dicks.

01:15:09.863 --> 01:15:12.260
MATT: Peddy, you got this?

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:13.619
SAM: Yeah.

01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:15.237
TALIESIN: Keep hitting until it goes?

01:15:15.237 --> 01:15:16.558
MARISHA: Yep.

01:15:16.597 --> 01:15:18.099
BRIAN: Again!

01:15:18.099 --> 01:15:19.969
LIAM: Oh, careful, that dick is moving!

01:15:19.985 --> 01:15:22.213
SAM: That dick is moving!

01:15:22.213 --> 01:15:23.346
MATT: Careful!

01:15:23.346 --> 01:15:25.370
MARISHA: "That's Bryce's dick, don't hammer it."

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:27.691
BRIAN: Bryce's dick?

01:15:27.691 --> 01:15:29.689
MARISHA: "Yeah, that's Bryce." Bryce goes, "Hey."

01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:30.701
MATT: Hey, Bryce.

01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:32.057
MARISHA: "'Sup, man."

01:15:32.057 --> 01:15:33.710
MATT: All right, Peddy.

01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.969
BRIAN: Easy. Yeah.

01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:38.598
MATT: Good choice.

01:15:38.598 --> 01:15:41.723
BRIAN: Good choice, stay as far away from the dick
as you can.

01:15:41.723 --> 01:15:43.881
MATT: No! Peddy!

01:15:43.881 --> 01:15:45.429
SAM: Oh, sorry!

01:15:45.429 --> 01:15:50.667
MARISHA: "No, this is good game testing. Good to
see what the trolls of the game will do, you know?"

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:53.802
BRIAN: We've got to put some meat in his mouth
immediately.

01:15:53.802 --> 01:15:56.638
SAM: I got flustered there, I got the jitters.

01:15:56.638 --> 01:16:01.310
LIAM: It's just like Waffle and my grandpappy
said: Jiggle it a little, it'll fit.

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:02.934
BRIAN: Oh, oh!

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:06.623
LIAM: Got to be tender sometimes and sometimes you
got to be hard.

01:16:06.623 --> 01:16:09.049
TALIESIN: Oh, good shot.

01:16:09.049 --> 01:16:13.744
SAM: One second, Polar. What happens if we lose
this game? What are the stakes here, again?

01:16:13.744 --> 01:16:16.393
BRIAN: Do we get to keep the dicks? How does
this work?

01:16:16.393 --> 01:16:19.748
MARISHA: "Oh, if you lose the game, then you
just lose the game. We're looking for honest

01:16:19.748 --> 01:16:21.905
"and constructive criticism."

01:16:21.905 --> 01:16:23.306
SAM: There are literally no stakes to this?

01:16:23.306 --> 01:16:24.576
MARISHA: "No, we just want your feedback, yeah."

01:16:24.576 --> 01:16:26.186
LIAM: Oh, so you're game devs.

01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:28.914
MARISHA: "Yeah, that's what I've been saying,
man."

01:16:28.914 --> 01:16:30.829
SAM: Hey, care to make this interesting?

01:16:30.829 --> 01:16:33.101
MARISHA: "Yeah, what do you mean?"

01:16:33.101 --> 01:16:34.649
SAM: If we win this game--

01:16:34.649 --> 01:16:36.624
BRIAN: We keep the dicks!

01:16:36.624 --> 01:16:39.465
SAM: No. Liam Las Vegas, please.

01:16:39.465 --> 01:16:43.863
BRIAN: Three of those dicks are in pretty good
shape.

01:16:43.863 --> 01:16:50.206
SAM: Maybe you could give us safe passage up to
the interior of Fort Lox.

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:57.111
MARISHA: "Are you kidding me? No one can get into
Fort Lox, it's impenetrable! Not like our mates!"

01:16:57.111 --> 01:17:04.541
SAM: Well, could you at least give us some means
of travel that's slightly more advanced than this

01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:07.801
cart full of champagne glasses?

01:17:07.801 --> 01:17:09.597
MATT: Yeah, how'd you guys get up here, anyway?

01:17:09.597 --> 01:17:12.999
MARISHA: "Well, we have an extra cart that we're
using to haul all of our games."

01:17:12.999 --> 01:17:15.361
MATT: There we go, maybe you trade your cart for
ours.

01:17:15.361 --> 01:17:17.313
SAM: If we win.

01:17:17.313 --> 01:17:20.056
MARISHA: "Are you willing to distribute our games
if we give you the cart?"

01:17:20.056 --> 01:17:26.317
BRIAN: Yeah, we'll Kickstart those games right off the
cart about 15 yards from when we leave these guys.

01:17:26.317 --> 01:17:30.309
MARISHA: "Yeah? Would you be willing to do that?
Because you know, we've got the creative side, but

01:17:30.309 --> 01:17:32.326
we don't have the publishing side, man."

01:17:32.326 --> 01:17:34.593
BRIAN: Yeah, no, we can handle distribution.

01:17:34.593 --> 01:17:37.687
TALIESIN: That seems fair, yeah.

01:17:37.687 --> 01:17:45.299
MARISHA: "You know what? You've got a deal,
brother from another mother. Polar Rising, yeah!"

01:17:45.299 --> 01:17:48.571
MATT: Okay, okay, okay.

01:17:48.571 --> 01:17:49.964
SAM: Oh, watch your hat.

01:17:49.964 --> 01:17:51.544
MATT: Got the microphone, sorry.

01:17:51.544 --> 01:17:52.948
MARISHA: "Not the dicks."

01:17:52.948 --> 01:17:54.632
BRIAN: It's a high boom.

01:17:54.632 --> 01:17:56.595
MARISHA: "Careful, that one's Chad's."

01:17:56.595 --> 01:17:58.444
SAM: Come on, Trinket.

01:17:58.444 --> 01:17:59.802
MATT: All right.

01:17:59.802 --> 01:18:03.576
LIAM: As I'm standing here watching my friends
play this game, I can't help but think: you know,

01:18:03.576 --> 01:18:09.062
any good game, any time that I've enjoyed,
involves balls. Am I right or am I wrong?

01:18:09.062 --> 01:18:11.137
BRIAN: You are not wrong.

01:18:11.137 --> 01:18:12.919
LIAM: I don't know, workshop it, maybe.

01:18:12.919 --> 01:18:15.157
MARISHA: "Yeah, Bryce, take notes. You taking these
notes?"

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.537
SAM: That seems like a bad idea.

01:18:17.537 --> 01:18:18.979
BRIAN: That's where you're going to go, that's
your choice?

01:18:18.979 --> 01:18:20.399
SAM: I don't know about that one.

01:18:20.399 --> 01:18:21.922
TALIESIN: Nothing you can do about it.

01:18:21.922 --> 01:18:25.446
BRIAN: Oh, that's a real edgelord. That's a real
edgelord thing to do.

01:18:25.481 --> 01:18:27.745
TALIESIN: Walking the line there.

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:30.995
BRIAN: All right, boys, let me show you how it's
done.

01:18:30.995 --> 01:18:33.120
MATT: What you got Las Vegas? Show us.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.501
BRIAN: Let me show you how this is done.

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:35.519
MATT: No!

01:18:35.519 --> 01:18:37.796
BRIAN: We want to knock the polar bear into the
water below, right?

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.217
MATT: No!

01:18:39.223 --> 01:18:43.585
SAM: I could have sworn that was the point of the
game.

01:18:43.674 --> 01:18:45.491
BRIAN: I thought so, too.

01:18:45.514 --> 01:18:49.239
MATT: The point of the game is to not be the one to
knock them in there and you can't hammer the dicks.

01:18:49.486 --> 01:18:53.173
TALIESIN: You really got to explain this game
better, that's a big problem.

01:18:53.173 --> 01:18:55.367
MATT: Yeah, the instruction manual on it is pretty
terrible.

01:18:55.367 --> 01:18:57.605
MARISHA: "Okay, Bryce, write that down."

01:18:57.605 --> 01:19:00.453
SAM: This is not a good a good move, Liam Las
Vegas!

01:19:00.453 --> 01:19:03.570
LIAM: He's going to cock it up!

01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:06.519
BRIAN: Dude, you're adding to the pressure.

01:19:06.657 --> 01:19:10.791
MATT: All right, who's on that side?

01:19:10.791 --> 01:19:14.370
TALIESIN: Cookie, show them how we break the ice
down here.

01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:18.009
LIAM: Holy shit. This is not looking good.

01:19:18.009 --> 01:19:20.195
BRIAN: How many times do we have to hit it?

01:19:20.195 --> 01:19:29.861
MARISHA: "The person who knocks in the polar bear
first loses, or the first person who smacks a dick."

01:19:29.861 --> 01:19:34.810
LIAM: I'm going to hammer it. I'm going to tap it
and tap it. You just got to tap it.

01:19:34.832 --> 01:19:37.455
MATT: (groans)

01:19:37.455 --> 01:19:38.910
LIAM: That's how you tap it.

01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:40.476
MATT: All right, Peddy, you've got this.

01:19:40.691 --> 01:19:44.558
SAM: I haven't had enough bamboo! I don't know if
I can do it!

01:19:44.558 --> 01:19:47.117
BRIAN: He's got the shakes again.

01:19:47.117 --> 01:19:50.167
MATT: Peddy, hold on!

01:19:50.167 --> 01:19:52.539
SAM: I got it!

01:19:52.539 --> 01:19:58.149
LIAM: You're exploding all over the place, Peddy!

01:19:58.261 --> 01:19:59.444
SAM: I'm sorry!

01:19:59.444 --> 01:20:01.294
MATT: I can't bear this tension you're building
here!

01:20:01.294 --> 01:20:10.416
TALIESIN: This is a tough call. It's a tough call.
Don't know what to do. No. There we are.

01:20:11.616 --> 01:20:15.917
SAM: Easy, easy!

01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:18.342
BRIAN: Don't say easy coming from the guy who
just--

01:20:18.342 --> 01:20:22.695
TALIESIN: Ah, there we are! Like that! Like honey.
Smooth.

01:20:22.695 --> 01:20:26.242
MATT: Las Vegas. It's getting a little tense.

01:20:26.316 --> 01:20:27.481
SAM: Hey, polar.

01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:28.717
MARISHA: "Yeah."

01:20:28.717 --> 01:20:30.590
SAM: Now that we've known each other a couple
minutes, be honest.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:31.866
MARISHA: "Sure."

01:20:31.866 --> 01:20:39.870
SAM: You ever had sex before? No, right? I mean,
come on, nobody who spends as much time gaming--

01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:43.081
what happened?

01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:44.989
BRIAN and SAM: Did we lose a dick?

01:20:44.989 --> 01:20:49.470
MARISHA: Wait! You can <i>lose</i> dicks, you just
can't <i>hammer</i> dicks.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:53.504
LIAM: I mean, regardless of the outcome here, I
feel like you fellas should maybe head south. We

01:20:53.504 --> 01:20:56.754
just came from a wedding. Instead of standing
there with your dick in your hands?

01:20:56.754 --> 01:20:58.655
MARISHA: "You just came from a wedding?"

01:20:58.655 --> 01:21:01.648
SAM and BRIAN: Lots of bridesmaids.

01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:03.523
MARISHA: "You serious, man?"

01:21:03.742 --> 01:21:05.691
LIAM: Maybe stop complaining about dicks and maybe
try to use some.

01:21:05.691 --> 01:21:07.159
MARISHA: "Chad, Bryce, you hear that, man?"

01:21:07.159 --> 01:21:16.793
LIAM: Okay. This is going to be a little hard. On.
Me. But I think I can do it.

01:21:16.793 --> 01:21:19.541
SAM: Just keep those blocks erect and you'll be
okay. Oh.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:22.199
TALIESIN: More rhythm.

01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:24.927
BRIAN: Yeah, go between the dicks, that's what I
always say.

01:21:24.927 --> 01:21:26.713
LIAM: No. That's a bad call.

01:21:26.713 --> 01:21:33.138
SAM: The stakes could not be lower.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:43.266
BRIAN: All right, I don't want to lose another
dick. But--

01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:49.390
MARISHA: "I appreciate your guys' gentleness and
candor with keeping the dicks on the board for as

01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:51.074
"long as possible."

01:21:51.074 --> 01:21:56.036
MATT: We respect the materials you brought to this
endeavor.

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:58.493
SAM: Oh boy.

01:21:58.493 --> 01:22:00.178
BRIAN: Smooth as ever.

01:22:00.178 --> 01:22:01.692
SAM: It's getting down to it.

01:22:01.692 --> 01:22:05.991
LIAM: All right, Waffle use those smarts. Hang
some brain.

01:22:05.991 --> 01:22:10.824
TALIESIN: I got this. This ain't nothing.

01:22:10.824 --> 01:22:15.278
SAM: Man, this game really stinks. Like it smells
bad.

01:22:15.278 --> 01:22:16.689
TALIESIN: Look at that.

01:22:16.689 --> 01:22:18.636
MARISHA: Smells like carcinogens and plastic?

01:22:18.636 --> 01:22:20.659
SAM: Smells like balls.

01:22:20.659 --> 01:22:22.648
TALIESIN: Don't want to smell the hammer.

01:22:22.648 --> 01:22:24.457
BRIAN: Is the name of this game "Taint Tappers?"

01:22:24.457 --> 01:22:27.258
MARISHA: We bought it in the children's toy
aisle.

01:22:27.258 --> 01:22:30.428
LIAM: We got to hurry this up; I am running out of
genitalia puns.

01:22:30.428 --> 01:22:32.190
BRIAN: Yes, agreed.

01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:33.987
MATT: No, not underneath the guy!

01:22:33.987 --> 01:22:35.198
BRIAN: Not right underneath--

01:22:35.198 --> 01:22:39.701
MARISHA: "That is literally the block of ice
that's holding up the polar bear, man."

01:22:39.701 --> 01:22:45.907
SAM: All right, I guess I get-- There's no-- I got
nothing.

01:22:45.907 --> 01:22:47.449
MATT: Peddy, come on you can-- (shouting)

01:22:47.449 --> 01:22:49.906
ALL: Ooh!

01:22:49.906 --> 01:22:51.481
SAM: I hit in a dick.

01:22:51.481 --> 01:22:55.548
MARISHA: "You got close to our dick, but
I think you're all right. I'll let my brother

01:22:55.548 --> 01:22:57.435
"from another mother pass."

01:22:57.435 --> 01:22:58.858
TALIESIN: You grazed a dick.

01:22:58.858 --> 01:23:00.219
SAM: I did graze the dick.

01:23:00.219 --> 01:23:01.536
LIAM: Is it me, Waffle?

01:23:01.536 --> 01:23:03.255
TALIESIN: It's you, Cookie. It's all up to you
now.

01:23:03.255 --> 01:23:07.413
LIAM: It's not looking good; I am not the brains;
I am not the muscle. I don't know how to drive.

01:23:07.413 --> 01:23:17.748
I've never stolen nothing. Oh boy. Oh the
pressure. I bet he would-- is he glued to that?

01:23:17.748 --> 01:23:22.731
MARISHA: Taped. No, that's the thing he's floating
on! He's on a four by four.

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:24.142
LIAM: There is no way to win here.

01:23:24.142 --> 01:23:25.568
MARISHA: He's on a two by two.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:26.657
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

01:23:26.657 --> 01:23:31.230
BRIAN: A guy as good looking as you hasn't gotten
this far without tapping a few dicks though, right?

01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:35.720
LIAM: You don't know what I've tapped.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.564
BRIAN: I'd like to.

01:23:37.564 --> 01:23:40.950
LIAM: We'll talk about that later. I don't think
there's any way to win here.

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:43.445
BRIAN: We may need a flashback.

01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:45.559
LIAM: Ah! Fuck it, let's move on to the next--

01:23:45.559 --> 01:23:47.639
ALL: Oh!

01:23:47.639 --> 01:23:51.517
SAM: I still don't understand this game!

01:23:51.517 --> 01:23:53.316
LIAM: I might have done a little time.

01:23:53.316 --> 01:23:56.790
BRIAN: That dick was on top and now it's on the
bottom.

01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:59.256
LIAM: I could have been in the Bear Acuda if I
wanted to!

01:23:59.256 --> 01:24:00.827
ALL: Ooh!

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.909
MARISHA: He's hanging by a thread!

01:24:03.909 --> 01:24:06.417
BRIAN: He's hanging by a pube, guys!

01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:08.716
MARISHA: That's true, you can do that.

01:24:08.716 --> 01:24:10.956
LIAM: I don't know how that's going to work.

01:24:10.956 --> 01:24:13.716
SAM: How would that even stay? How is that going
to stay?

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.883
MARISHA: Oh god it's vibrating all over.

01:24:15.883 --> 01:24:17.544
BRIAN: That's normal.

01:24:17.544 --> 01:24:20.195
SAM: I don't understand!

01:24:20.195 --> 01:24:21.890
LIAM: So that can go down, but the bear's up.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.411
TALIESIN: The bear's still up!

01:24:23.411 --> 01:24:26.936
LIAM: He's still up. Unlike you fellas.

01:24:26.936 --> 01:24:30.341
SAM: You can't hit that dick!

01:24:30.341 --> 01:24:32.776
MARISHA: "At least in the temperate weather we
have a chance."

01:24:32.858 --> 01:24:39.268
LIAM: Oh jeez.

01:24:39.268 --> 01:24:42.135
TALIESIN: Cookie. Oh no.

01:24:42.135 --> 01:24:44.215
LIAM: Well, gentlemen.

01:24:44.215 --> 01:24:45.751
SAM: It's been an honor.

01:24:45.751 --> 01:24:51.221
MARISHA: "I hope you liked our game, everybody.
Do you feel like it really brought the full feeling

01:24:51.221 --> 01:24:54.109
"of being a polar bear floating on a piece of frozen
water?"

01:24:54.771 --> 01:24:57.964
SAM: It really gripped me and pulled me. It tugged
me right into the game.

01:24:57.964 --> 01:24:59.277
MARISHA: "Thank you."

01:24:59.277 --> 01:25:04.812
MATT: I'm glad that it could bring all five of us
to a very dramatic climax.

01:25:04.812 --> 01:25:08.052
SAM and MATT: Simultaneous.

01:25:08.052 --> 01:25:10.686
BRIAN: This was a good excuse to make a circle of
us jerks.

01:25:10.686 --> 01:25:13.675
(laughter)

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.482
(groaning)

01:25:15.482 --> 01:25:16.658
TALIESIN: And we're spent.

01:25:16.658 --> 01:25:19.914
MARISHA: "Well, thank you guys so much. I feel
like we really learned a lot from this experience."

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.739
SAM: I'm going to go to sleep.

01:25:21.739 --> 01:25:31.780
MARISHA: "Here, we made little stickers for anyone
that says, 'I'm an honorary member of Polar Rising."

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.987
MATT: Thanks, appreciate that.

01:25:33.987 --> 01:25:35.493
LIAM: Cool. Super cool.

01:25:35.493 --> 01:25:39.788
MARISHA: "Feel free to take our cart and thank
you. Thank you for everything."

01:25:39.788 --> 01:25:41.502
SAM: What's this game called?

01:25:41.502 --> 01:25:47.029
MARISHA: "Don't Break the Frozen Piece of Block
the Bear's Floating On."

01:25:47.029 --> 01:25:48.232
BRIAN: Oh yes.

01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.287
MARISHA: "Don't Break the Frozen Water."

01:25:51.287 --> 01:25:55.019
MATT: First bit of feedback-- No, it's good. Ship
it.

01:25:55.221 --> 01:25:56.311
MARISHA: "Okay."

01:25:56.311 --> 01:25:58.382
BRIAN: You should name it Just the Tap.

01:25:58.382 --> 01:26:02.689
LIAM: That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:05.660
MARISHA: "That's good. Write that down, Bryce.
Write that down."

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.273
BRIAN: Yeah, write that down, Bryce.

01:26:07.273 --> 01:26:11.850
MARISHA: "We'll do that on our second printing.
Thank you, guys." And they let you go.

01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:14.300
You start your way back.

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.891
LIAM: Have fun at the seduction seminar!

01:26:16.891 --> 01:26:21.546
MARISHA: "Thanks, man. We'll see you at the
wedding!" And as you guys start making your way

01:26:21.546 --> 01:26:24.313
back to Vinnie the Pooh's, we're going to take a
break!

01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:26.456
ALL: Woo!

01:26:26.456 --> 01:26:29.182
MATT: Just the Tap.

01:26:29.182 --> 01:26:30.634
LIAM: That got weird.

01:26:30.634 --> 01:26:32.420
BRIAN: Oh man.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.482
TALIESIN: That got weirder than I could have ever
hoped.

01:26:34.482 --> 01:26:38.280
BRIAN: As usual, I could not remember if you're
supposed to hit the dicks or not.

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.848
MARISHA: Don't hammer our dicks!

01:26:41.848 --> 01:26:46.345
TALIESIN: Don't hammer the dicks, but you got
to tap the ice.

01:26:46.345 --> 01:26:50.434
LIAM: You got to massage it a little, you know.
Finesse it. But you don't want to, you know. You

01:26:50.434 --> 01:26:51.981
don't want to mash it.

01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:55.141
BRIAN: I feel like we should have said something
to them about size not mattering. I felt like it

01:26:55.141 --> 01:26:56.850
could have done something for them later on in
life.

01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:58.697
MARISHA: True. It's a good message.

01:26:58.697 --> 01:27:00.121
BRIAN: We'll see how they fare at the wedding.

01:27:00.121 --> 01:27:01.597
MATT: That'll help for the DLC.

01:27:01.597 --> 01:27:06.753
MARISHA: It's hard to have more than one cause.
Okay. Enjoy this quick break, and so will we.

01:27:06.753 --> 01:27:08.392
We'll be back.

01:27:20.018 --> 01:27:24.710
MATT: (as Pumat Sol) "Well, hello there! My name
is Pumat Sol, owner and curator of

01:27:24.719 --> 01:27:29.353
"The Invulnerable Vagrant, where me and the other
Pumats have got everything you need for your

"exciting and potentially deadly adventure. Looking
for standard wizard stuff? We got that! Trying to

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.203
"track down that hard-to-find scroll of water
breathing? We got that, too!"

01:27:41.203 --> 01:27:48.529
(as Pumat II) "Actually, we just sold that scroll box."
"Or we will have that as soon as I enchant another one!

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:55.260
"Respectfully, when it comes to quality products
for a reasonable price, no one in Zadash has us

standard business hours and weekends.

01:28:07.035 --> 01:28:14.352
"The Invulnerable Vagrant: when it comes to

01:28:14.671 --> 01:28:26.278
[upbeat synthesizer music]

01:28:26.278 --> 01:28:27.273
[beep]

01:28:27.309 --> 01:28:29.769
MARISHA: You know what a face is, right?

01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:31.398
MATT: Guys, you know we're starting, right?

01:28:31.398 --> 01:28:32.497
MARISHA: Oh wait, are we rolling?

01:28:32.497 --> 01:28:34.176
BRIAN: I think so.

01:28:34.176 --> 01:28:45.966
MARISHA: Hi everyone! And welcome back to
Honey Heist 2: Electric Beargaloo. Okay, we're just

01:28:45.966 --> 01:28:48.956
going to go. We're just going to jump right into
it. Yeah.

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:51.377
LIAM: Are you saying we're just playing a game and
we're resuming the game?

01:28:51.377 --> 01:28:52.653
MARISHA: Yeah, we're resuming the game.

01:28:52.653 --> 01:28:53.688
LIAM: Let's do that.

01:28:53.688 --> 01:29:01.832
MARISHA: And not Just the Tap. As you guys make
your way back to the 1,070-- 9,072 Acre Wood, you

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:06.742
approach Vinnie the Pooh's house, and you can see
preparations on the wedding have progressed quite

01:29:06.742 --> 01:29:14.125
a bit. Even a few guests are starting to straggle in.
And you make your way back up to Vinnie the Pooh.

01:29:14.134 --> 01:29:16.374
MATT: All of us together?

01:29:16.572 --> 01:29:17.960
MARISHA: Well, whoever wants to go.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.102
LIAM: Yeah! United front, I say.

01:29:20.102 --> 01:29:25.786
MATT: Yeah. Make sure you guys can vouch for us if
need be, since we haven't been inside his facility.

01:29:25.786 --> 01:29:27.267
BRIAN: I can take care of that.

01:29:27.267 --> 01:29:28.868
MATT: All right, Las Vegas. Lead the way.

01:29:28.868 --> 01:29:30.524
BRIAN: Okay, we'll go into the room.

01:29:30.524 --> 01:29:37.205
MARISHA: You go in. Vinnie turns around in his
chair and he goes, "Oh, Liam. I see you delivered

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.233
"on the goods. Pretty good. Good job, man."

01:29:39.492 --> 01:29:42.273
BRIAN: I always deliver. Unless I can't.

01:29:42.273 --> 01:29:47.206
MARISHA: "My guys got back a few hours ago. Just
in time for the ceremony."

01:29:47.206 --> 01:29:48.993
BRIAN: Was the salmon still fresh?

01:29:48.993 --> 01:29:52.080
MARISHA: "It was some of the freshest that I've
ever tasted in my life."

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.446
BRIAN: Fantastic.

01:29:53.446 --> 01:29:54.639
MARISHA: "You do good work."

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:55.823
BRIAN: Yeah, thank you.

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:57.101
MARISHA: "I'm glad I can trust you boys."

01:29:57.101 --> 01:30:02.675
BRIAN: This is my crew. These guys made it happen.
I obviously masterminded the entire thing

01:30:02.675 --> 01:30:07.491
and did the execution perfectly, but they were
there to keep an eye out while I did it.

01:30:07.491 --> 01:30:12.135
MARISHA: "That's good to know. You guys are part
of the Pooh family now."

01:30:12.135 --> 01:30:13.911
SAM: We're all Poohs?

01:30:13.911 --> 01:30:19.702
MARISHA: "Well. I'm <i>the</i> Pooh. But you're part of
the family."

01:30:19.702 --> 01:30:21.501
BRIAN: We all Pooh down here.

01:30:21.501 --> 01:30:23.191
MATT: Right.

01:30:23.191 --> 01:30:28.895
BRIAN: So how about that information, now that we
successfully brought back your fishy stuff?

01:30:28.895 --> 01:30:34.702
MARISHA: "Well look. You know, it's Fort Lox. You
can't walk up right up to the front door. They

01:30:34.702 --> 01:30:39.367
"won't let you in. You'll be killed immediately.
But I can tell you that when I was smuggling for

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:49.145
"good ol' Hattori Bongo, there's a tunnel entrance
about 500 yards north of the fort. If you look for

01:30:49.145 --> 01:30:55.599
"it directly north of the fort, in the woods,
you'll find a little hole with a little cave entrance."

01:30:55.599 --> 01:30:57.811
BRIAN: Anything marking the hole?

01:30:57.811 --> 01:31:01.579
MARISHA: "Not really. You have to know
where to go."

01:31:01.579 --> 01:31:03.918
BRIAN: I'm pretty good at finding holes when I
need to.

01:31:03.918 --> 01:31:08.262
LIAM: Hey, I'm sorry, I got one question: are we
talking about like a small hole? Because there's

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:10.599
nothing more embarrassing than a bear getting
stuck in a hole.

01:31:10.599 --> 01:31:12.993
TALIESIN: Nothing more embarrassing.

01:31:12.993 --> 01:31:13.995
SAM: Adorable sometimes.

01:31:13.995 --> 01:31:17.160
MARISHA: "It's a moderate size doorway. You'll be
fine, Cookie."

01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:19.506
BRIAN: Moderate size. All right.

01:31:19.506 --> 01:31:25.262
MATT: Are we looking at any sort of difficulty as
far as weather patterns in the near future? When

01:31:25.262 --> 01:31:30.072
you planned your wedding? Don't want to deal with
any little rain clouds or--

01:31:30.072 --> 01:31:35.643
MARISHA: "My daughter was hoping for a temperate,
partly-cloudy wedding and I think the gods will

01:31:35.643 --> 01:31:39.404
"bless us today, on the day of her wedding."

01:31:39.404 --> 01:31:41.075
MATT: All right, I appreciate that.

01:31:41.075 --> 01:31:43.944
LIAM: I love it so much.

01:31:43.944 --> 01:31:54.404
MARISHA: "Well, look. You know, this is Hattori
Bongo we're talking about. There's going to be

01:31:54.404 --> 01:32:00.243
"guards. He's not a stupid bear. There's probably
going to be guards guarding the little secret

01:32:00.243 --> 01:32:07.872
"entrance. But from what I remember, there's always
a five-digit code that he changes every two days

01:32:07.872 --> 01:32:14.277
"or so to make sure no one gets wise on the code,
you know what I mean? People like to leak stuff."

01:32:14.277 --> 01:32:15.494
BRIAN: So?

01:32:15.494 --> 01:32:16.938
SAM: What's the code?

01:32:16.938 --> 01:32:18.333
MARISHA: "I don't know."

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:19.609
BRIAN: Who does?

01:32:19.609 --> 01:32:28.617
MARISHA: "I can tell you it's some alternating
two-- five-digit code between salmon and bamboo.

01:32:28.617 --> 01:32:30.438
"So I'd be on the lookout."

01:32:30.438 --> 01:32:34.417
SAM and BRIAN: Between salmon and bamboo?

01:32:34.417 --> 01:32:38.891
MARISHA: "That's the only thing I ever heard when
I overheard some of his guys talking about it."

01:32:38.891 --> 01:32:40.535
MATT: Maybe it's a French Stewart movie.

01:32:40.535 --> 01:32:44.235
LIAM: Oh. My. Goodness.

01:32:44.235 --> 01:32:47.353
BRIAN: Holy shit. I haven't heard that name--

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:51.452
MATT: I don't think he's ever done a movie.

01:32:51.452 --> 01:32:54.840
BRIAN: I was going to say, that may not exist.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:59.230
LIAM: So, it's a five-digit code somewhere between
salmon and bamboo?

01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:00.414
MARISHA: "Yeah."

01:33:00.414 --> 01:33:02.975
LIAM: All right. And that's whole of what you
know?

01:33:02.975 --> 01:33:06.239
MARISHA: "That's all I know. That's going to be
your best way in."

01:33:06.239 --> 01:33:09.712
LIAM: Well, we got Waffle. He's pretty smart, so
I'm sure he's going to figure it out.

01:33:09.712 --> 01:33:11.001
TALIESIN: I'll figure it out.

01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:15.679
BRIAN: Do you know about how many guys he's got on
the inside? Besides the guards that are, you know,

01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:17.405
watching the door?

01:33:17.405 --> 01:33:23.070
MARISHA: "I don't know. I know Hattori Bongo never
runs with less than eight or so guys. But if he's

01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:28.289
"taken over a small fort? Who knows. Sounds like a
pretty big job he's trying to pull."

01:33:28.289 --> 01:33:35.033
MATT: Vinnie, my gracious Pooh-- Trinket, we
haven't been introduced.

01:33:35.033 --> 01:33:37.378
MARISHA: "Pleasure to meet you, Trinket."

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:38.574
MATT: You as well.

01:33:38.574 --> 01:33:39.822
MARISHA: "Welcome to the family."

01:33:39.822 --> 01:33:45.049
MATT: Happy to be part of it. I have a question
for you. You wouldn't happen to know or heard of

01:33:45.049 --> 01:33:52.902
the whereabouts or hopeful safe status of one Kody
Yak, would you?

01:33:52.902 --> 01:33:58.242
MARISHA: "No, I don't know of this Mr. Yak that
you're talking about."

01:33:58.242 --> 01:34:00.912
MATT: No worries, just asking. Thank you.

01:34:00.912 --> 01:34:06.719
MARISHA: "But may God be with him today, on the
day of my daughter's wedding."

01:34:06.719 --> 01:34:10.958
MATT: Fair enough. You're generous with your
blessings.

01:34:10.958 --> 01:34:13.913
BRIAN: That's a lot of blessings. I feel
over-blessed.

01:34:13.913 --> 01:34:15.091
MARISHA: "It's a blessed day, you know?"

01:34:15.091 --> 01:34:16.242
BRIAN: Yeah, of course.

01:34:16.242 --> 01:34:19.181
SAM: Just out of curiosity, where is your daughter
right now?

01:34:19.181 --> 01:34:24.220
MARISHA: "Well, my daughter she's getting ready to
be married. Today is her wedding day."

01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:28.462
SAM: Today is the day of her wedding? You must be
so proud.

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:29.878
MARISHA: "So proud."

01:34:29.878 --> 01:34:30.895
SAM: Who's she marrying?

01:34:30.895 --> 01:34:32.056
MATT: That's a good question.

01:34:32.056 --> 01:34:36.004
MARISHA: I didn't think of a pun for this.

01:34:36.056 --> 01:34:38.521
SAM: Who's going to be the new Pooh?

01:34:38.521 --> 01:34:43.296
MATT: The Pooh Junior? The tiniest Pooh you've
ever seen.

01:34:43.296 --> 01:34:45.092
SAM: Who's going to carry on the Pooh name?

01:34:45.092 --> 01:34:49.126
MARISHA: "Um."

01:34:49.126 --> 01:34:55.186
SAM: Oh. He's one of those mysterious types. I
understand, Mr. Pooh, you don't want to give away

01:34:55.186 --> 01:34:57.854
too many details. These are personal questions,
I'm sorry.

01:34:57.854 --> 01:34:58.880
MATT: Yes, it's a security thing.

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:00.489
SAM: I'm sorry. I apologize.

01:35:00.489 --> 01:35:01.991
MARISHA: "Finding flaws in my narrative."

01:35:01.991 --> 01:35:03.860
SAM: No, not at all! I was just curious.

01:35:04.069 --> 01:35:06.801
BRIAN: He's probably royalty of some sort and he
doesn't want--

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:07.943
MATT: Can't assume it's a he.

01:35:07.943 --> 01:35:09.189
BRIAN: Oh yeah.

01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:10.876
MATT: Remember, it's progressive times in
Tal'Dorei.

01:35:10.876 --> 01:35:12.655
BRIAN: Well, I've been in the woods for quite some
time.

01:35:12.655 --> 01:35:17.793
MARISHA: "It's a man. And he's probably banging
one of the bridesmaids right about now."

01:35:17.793 --> 01:35:19.448
SAM: Is that okay?

01:35:19.448 --> 01:35:24.323
MARISHA: "Happens in the movie. All right. Be on
your way."

01:35:24.565 --> 01:35:27.003
(laughter)

01:35:27.003 --> 01:35:28.967
SAM: Wow. She really likes that French Stewart
movie.

01:35:28.967 --> 01:35:33.052
MATT: I haven't seen Christopher Robin yet, so
maybe she's spoiled it for me.

01:35:33.052 --> 01:35:37.905
BRIAN: Well.

01:35:37.905 --> 01:35:39.272
MARISHA: That happened.

01:35:39.272 --> 01:35:41.543
BRIAN: Thank you for the information.

01:35:41.543 --> 01:35:43.648
MARISHA: "You're welcome."

01:35:43.648 --> 01:35:45.994
BRIAN: Yeah, page me sometime.

01:35:45.994 --> 01:35:52.103
MARISHA: "Okay. If you're passing back through, feel
free to stop by the reception, get yourself a cocktail."

01:35:52.103 --> 01:35:53.808
BRIAN: Oh, we will.

01:35:53.808 --> 01:36:00.954
MATT: Quick, Brains, see if you can find a way to
cleverly ask if this Hattori Bongo has any fears,

01:36:00.954 --> 01:36:02.909
weaknesses, anything we should know.

01:36:02.909 --> 01:36:04.777
TALIESIN: I got just the idea.

01:36:04.777 --> 01:36:06.265
MATT: All right, you take this.

01:36:06.265 --> 01:36:10.549
TALIESIN: Does this Hattori Bongo have any
weaknesses or fears of some kind?

01:36:10.549 --> 01:36:12.276
MATT: That was good.

01:36:12.276 --> 01:36:13.558
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. Thank you.

01:36:13.558 --> 01:36:15.936
SAM: That's why he's The Brains, always thinking.
Thinking hard.

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:18.041
LIAM: Direct.

01:36:18.041 --> 01:36:20.156
MARISHA: "That's an excellent question."

01:36:20.156 --> 01:36:21.774
TALIESIN: Glad I thought of it.

01:36:21.774 --> 01:36:26.124
MARISHA: "You know, he's a very smart man. Very
(slurred) ruthless."

01:36:26.124 --> 01:36:27.874
TALIESIN: "Woothless?"

01:36:27.874 --> 01:36:29.349
BRIAN: Oh, he's "woothless."

01:36:29.365 --> 01:36:31.285
TALIESIN: I need some "wooth."

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.334
BRIAN: Pick up some "wooth" in town.

01:36:32.334 --> 01:36:33.358
MARISHA: "That's what I said."

01:36:33.358 --> 01:36:34.434
LIAM: Who's Rufus?

01:36:34.445 --> 01:36:37.325
TALIESIN: Ruth. His daughter's marrying. Got to
keep up.

01:36:37.519 --> 01:36:39.027
MARISHA: "I still don't hear a problem."

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:40.865
BRIAN: I lost my "wooth" when I was 12.

01:36:40.865 --> 01:36:47.938
MATT: I had mine removed. It got inflamed when I
was in high school.

01:36:47.938 --> 01:36:52.640
LIAM: This is-- this is not--

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.528
TALIESIN: Mister Vinnie the Pooh.

01:36:54.528 --> 01:36:56.384
MARISHA: "He worked his way up."

01:36:56.384 --> 01:36:57.550
SAM: Keep us on track.

01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:59.960
LIAM: This is not proper roleplay. This is not
proper roleplay.

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:06.647
TALIESIN: We respectfully ask for any information
to make this job easier.

01:37:06.647 --> 01:37:14.486
MARISHA: "I knew Hattori Bongo back when he was
just a lackey for the Bear Acuda. I heard about

01:37:14.486 --> 01:37:20.386
"six months or so ago, he (slurred) worked his way
up the ranks."

01:37:20.386 --> 01:37:27.302
BRIAN: How much honey cocktails have you had
today, Vinnie?

01:37:27.302 --> 01:37:29.010
LIAM: It's pretty accurate.

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.272
MATT: It really is.

01:37:31.272 --> 01:37:34.554
TALIESIN: This is what's making it so weird.
<i>How?</i>

01:37:34.589 --> 01:37:41.292
LIAM: It only could be more accurate if she was
reading it off of script papers taped to our chests.

01:37:41.299 --> 01:37:42.757
BRIAN: And she refused to do coverage.

01:37:42.757 --> 01:37:50.908
(laughter)

01:37:50.908 --> 01:37:55.139
LIAM: I bet you wish you could control me like one of
your fucking Muppets with your hand up my ass, huh?

01:37:55.382 --> 01:38:01.221
MATT: Vinnie, thank you so much for your time.

01:38:01.221 --> 01:38:07.381
MARISHA: "No problem. Godspeed on your journey on
this blessed day."

01:38:07.401 --> 01:38:11.071
(laughter

01:38:11.081 --> 01:38:15.839
SAM: We'll bring back a wedding gift in honor of
you and your daughter. And her mystery husband.

01:38:15.839 --> 01:38:20.248
BRIAN: Yeah. If we make this out alive, we'll
bring back a gift for your daughter and her

01:38:20.437 --> 01:38:21.824
unknown spouse.

01:38:21.824 --> 01:38:23.384
MATT: Maybe the bridesmaid too.

01:38:23.384 --> 01:38:28.874
BRIAN: Definitely the horny bridesmaids, and we'll
pick up some Nicorette on the way too because you

01:38:28.874 --> 01:38:31.754
really got to quit that. It's getting to be
illegible.

01:38:31.754 --> 01:38:37.915
MARISHA: "I heard they keep some very special
prize honey up at Fort Lox. Some rare shit."

01:38:38.188 --> 01:38:39.314
BRIAN: Yeah?

01:38:39.314 --> 01:38:40.716
MARISHA: "There's some good stuff."

01:38:40.716 --> 01:38:42.178
BRIAN: The kind of shit you mainline?

01:38:42.178 --> 01:38:50.583
MARISHA: "You know, if you find something, keep in
mind your good ol' friend Vinnie the Pooh."

01:38:50.583 --> 01:38:52.777
BRIAN: Oh we will. I actually have one more
question.

01:38:52.777 --> 01:38:54.447
MARISHA: "Yeah?"

01:38:54.447 --> 01:38:58.503
BRIAN: Where's the honey being kept inside the
fort? Is it in a safe?

01:38:58.503 --> 01:39:03.740
MARISHA: "Oh, there's-- hm. There's honey all over
the fort."

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:08.350
(laughter)

01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:11.157
BRIAN: You know, my first wife said that to me on
our wedding night.

01:39:11.157 --> 01:39:16.426
MATT: We're sorry to bother you when you've
reached peak levels of intoxication.

01:39:16.641 --> 01:39:18.091
BRIAN: Yeah, we can tell you need a nap.

01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:22.274
LIAM: It's an emotional day. It's cool to
partake.

01:39:22.274 --> 01:39:26.237
MATT: We'll leave you to focus on that which
matters.

01:39:26.237 --> 01:39:29.517
BRIAN: This blessed day is all yours now.

01:39:29.517 --> 01:39:31.013
MARISHA: "Thank you, good sirs."

01:39:31.013 --> 01:39:32.464
BRIAN: We'll head up to the--

01:39:32.464 --> 01:39:37.235
SAM: Yeah, thank you bear-y much and bear-well.

01:39:37.235 --> 01:39:41.111
BRIAN: You're dis-koala-fied.

01:39:41.111 --> 01:39:44.500
MATT: Did you say "dis-koala-fied"?

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:50.746
BRIAN: All right, let's get out of this room
before Vinnie passes out.

01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:56.047
MARISHA: Oh, thank god. I didn't expect to talk
<i>that</i> much as Vinnie.

01:39:56.047 --> 01:39:59.914
BRIAN: Do we need to grab anything before we head
up north?

01:39:59.914 --> 01:40:02.089
SAM: We got a cart. We've got some supplies.

01:40:02.089 --> 01:40:06.183
LIAM: He offered for us to get some more honey. I
mean, I got some, but you can never have enough.

01:40:06.183 --> 01:40:12.755
BRIAN: Yeah, that's true. Shall we stop by the bar
and get a couple more cocktails on the way out?

01:40:12.755 --> 01:40:19.218
TALIESIN: Couple more cocktails. Are there any
interesting centerpieces on the tables, anything

01:40:19.218 --> 01:40:20.684
of value?

01:40:20.747 --> 01:40:23.485
MARISHA: Some nice blush colored roses and
daisies.

01:40:23.485 --> 01:40:27.600
LIAM: What about something to beat a bear over the
head with?

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:33.288
MARISHA: There's nice wooden chairs with furniture
legs.

01:40:33.288 --> 01:40:37.464
TALIESIN: Any candles, something like that?

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:39.881
MARISHA: It's more of a daytime wedding.

01:40:39.881 --> 01:40:44.766
BRIAN: Do you know if they plan on having any
fireworks at the end of the wedding?

01:40:44.766 --> 01:40:50.829
MARISHA: Sure.

01:40:50.829 --> 01:40:53.967
BRIAN: Do you happen to know where they might be
located?

01:40:53.967 --> 01:40:55.896
LIAM: Who're talking to?

01:40:55.896 --> 01:40:58.256
BRIAN: Talking to the BM.

01:40:58.256 --> 01:41:00.761
LIAM: The who?

01:41:00.761 --> 01:41:02.433
BRIAN: The Bear Master.

01:41:02.433 --> 01:41:07.050
LIAM: Like a Mast-bear of Ceremonies? What're
you--

01:41:07.050 --> 01:41:12.857
BRIAN: We should find somebody and ask if they
have any fireworks that they plan on using at the

01:41:12.857 --> 01:41:14.149
end of the wedding.

01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:16.532
TALIESIN: So now you're not talking to the fourth
wall?

01:41:16.532 --> 01:41:19.067
BRIAN: I'm talking to you, Brains.

01:41:19.067 --> 01:41:23.140
TALIESIN: Let's take a look around, see if we can
find some fireworks, something to start a fire.

01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:27.699
LIAM: Also, I don't know if there is a bear
jamboree for the wedding, but if there's any

01:41:27.699 --> 01:41:29.953
instruments lying around, I might grab an
instrument.

01:41:29.953 --> 01:41:36.161
MARISHA: There was a string quartet. You roll to
see if you can steal one. You roll to see if you

01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:39.368
can find explosives.

01:41:39.368 --> 01:41:40.674
TALIESIN: All right!

01:41:40.674 --> 01:41:42.082
MARISHA: No?

01:41:42.082 --> 01:41:43.929
MATT: Never asked the thief to steal for you?

01:41:43.929 --> 01:41:46.633
TALIESIN: Succeed!

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:48.803
LIAM: Bear Master told me to do it!

01:41:48.803 --> 01:41:57.055
MARISHA: You see Cookie go up to the string
quartet and as he's about to reach for the violin,

01:41:57.275 --> 01:42:02.588
he trips over the tambourine set up and causes a
big distraction and at this point--

01:42:02.588 --> 01:42:04.039
LIAM: Ow!

01:42:04.039 --> 01:42:09.317
MARISHA: --you look behind one of the folding
screens where they're stashing a bunch of stuff

01:42:09.317 --> 01:42:18.025
and you do find a crate, filled with a few small
sparklers, bottle rocket-y things, nothing too crazy.

01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:20.371
TALIESIN: Sweet Baloo, we hit the jackpot.

01:42:20.371 --> 01:42:24.703
MARISHA: Something that would look good on
Instagram, that's what you found.

01:42:24.703 --> 01:42:27.752
MATT: While they're doing this, I'm going to keep
an eye out, and see if there's any signs of

01:42:27.752 --> 01:42:36.459
possible Bear Acuda infiltrating the wedding.
Anybody who is masquerading as an attendant or

01:42:36.459 --> 01:42:39.489
planner for this event that looks a bit
mischievous.

01:42:39.489 --> 01:42:41.482
MARISHA: Okay, roll for criminal.

01:42:41.482 --> 01:42:48.293
BRIAN: We did see some servers that could've been
disguised. Yeah, good thinking.

01:42:48.293 --> 01:42:54.157
MATT: Does being a person who's good at
infiltration give me any bonuses?

01:42:54.157 --> 01:42:56.378
MARISHA: Being good at thieving?

01:42:56.378 --> 01:42:57.668
MATT: I'll just roll the dice, I'll roll the
dice!

01:42:57.668 --> 01:42:59.060
MARISHA: To look for things?

01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:00.157
MATT: I succeed!

01:43:00.157 --> 01:43:10.620
MARISHA: You look around, there's a lot of people
in tuxes, it's a lot of pink. (sighs) It's hard to say.

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:17.622
There's also a lot of-- this crowd is already shady-looking,
being that it is happening at Vinnie the Pooh's.

01:43:17.622 --> 01:43:19.391
MATT: All right. I think we're okay.

01:43:19.391 --> 01:43:21.301
TALIESIN: We should pocket some salmon while we're
here, too.

01:43:21.301 --> 01:43:22.974
MARISHA: Mm-hmm? Okay.

01:43:22.974 --> 01:43:29.134
MATT: I hide it in my beard. Sorry, I'm just
remembering that scene from Trading Places, with

01:43:29.134 --> 01:43:35.914
Dan Aykroyd, eating salmon through his dirty Santa
beard. That will never leave me. Anyway, continuing.

01:43:35.914 --> 01:43:37.771
MARISHA: You now have pocket salmon.

01:43:37.771 --> 01:43:39.551
MATT: Pocket salmon. I'm writing that down.

01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:48.721
SAM: Hey, Brains. Waffle, I've been thinking about
this code. He said it was between salmon and

01:43:48.721 --> 01:43:56.125
bamboo. If you rearrange the letters in those
words, you get either <i>No Más</i> Boom, Moon Samba,

01:43:56.125 --> 01:43:58.128
or <i>Las Mambo.</i>

01:43:58.128 --> 01:44:04.640
TALIESIN: So either these fireworks aren't going
to work, we're going to have to dance in the

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:10.800
moonlight or we're just going to have to dance. We
should all be prepared to dance.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.557
SAM: All right, I'll limber up.

01:44:12.557 --> 01:44:14.488
TALIESIN: Five digit dance code.

01:44:14.488 --> 01:44:18.158
BRIAN: Did you find any explosive or fireworks?

01:44:18.158 --> 01:44:20.051
TALIESIN: I found some explosives.

01:44:20.051 --> 01:44:25.863
SAM: Do we have any way of lighting them? Are
there any candles around?

01:44:25.863 --> 01:44:28.900
TALIESIN: I've already looked for candles. It's a
daytime wedding.

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:32.320
MARISHA: Outside. Afternoon reception.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.836
BRIAN: We could always do it like the old days and
rub a few sticks together to get some fire.

01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:42.292
MATT: It's all right. If worst comes to absolutely
worst, I got a plan to light those fireworks. Trust me.

01:44:42.292 --> 01:44:45.687
SAM: All right, then let's go do this caper.

01:44:45.687 --> 01:44:47.296
BRIAN: Let's get up to the--

01:44:47.296 --> 01:44:49.301
LIAM: Let's find that Pooh hole.

01:44:49.301 --> 01:44:57.766
MARISHA: You get on the cart and you go back north
the way that you came when you ran into the Polar

01:44:57.766 --> 01:45:06.271
Rising. It takes you another hour or so and you
crest into the opening, the clearing, which leads

01:45:06.271 --> 01:45:09.218
into a valley, where you see in the distance Fort
Lox.

01:45:09.218 --> 01:45:13.414
SAM: It's amazing.

01:45:13.414 --> 01:45:17.468
BRIAN: 500 yards north is what they said.

01:45:17.468 --> 01:45:19.595
LIAM: That's a fuck of a lot of honey.

01:45:19.595 --> 01:45:21.149
BRIAN: It's a lot of honey.

01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:22.451
LIAM: Oh, baby.

01:45:22.451 --> 01:45:24.453
MATT: Let's case the joint and get our bearings.

01:45:24.453 --> 01:45:27.707
TALIESIN: (groans)

01:45:27.707 --> 01:45:29.084
MATT: Sorry.

01:45:29.084 --> 01:45:30.287
SAM: Starting to get the jitters again.

01:45:30.287 --> 01:45:37.685
MARISHA: You all-- taking a wide berth around the
fort-- head north. Does someone want to roll to

01:45:37.685 --> 01:45:41.992
search to see if they can find the hidden
entrance?

01:45:41.992 --> 01:45:45.264
SAM: I'm steering the ship. I'll roll to see if I
can find something. What am I rolling for,

01:45:45.264 --> 01:45:46.691
criminal or bear?

01:45:46.691 --> 01:45:51.789
MARISHA: I'd say roll for bear since you're sniffing
and searching; you're tracking a little bit.

01:45:51.789 --> 01:45:54.376
SAM: That's a fail.

01:45:54.376 --> 01:45:56.712
MARISHA: You're having a hard time.

01:45:56.712 --> 01:45:59.349
SAM: Do I lose a bear point? Oh, a point goes into
bear.

01:45:59.349 --> 01:46:00.618
MARISHA: Into bear, yes.

01:46:00.618 --> 01:46:02.600
LIAM: You should stick to what you're good at.

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.672
SAM: I'm just getting the jitters again, I need a
little bamboo.

01:46:04.672 --> 01:46:07.478
LIAM: Do we got any of that left for you?

01:46:07.478 --> 01:46:09.385
SAM: Yeah, I brought a little bit.

01:46:09.385 --> 01:46:12.303
LIAM: Chew on that, let Cookie and Waffle search
out the smell of honey.

01:46:12.303 --> 01:46:14.858
TALIESIN: We're going to smell for honey.

01:46:14.858 --> 01:46:20.508
MARISHA: Okay, you have an advantage on sensing
honey, so you roll for advantage--

01:46:20.508 --> 01:46:22.935
LIAM: Both. We're honey bears.

01:46:22.935 --> 01:46:26.826
MARISHA: Oh, you're honey bears, so both of you
roll-- And you roll to see if you can see any

01:46:26.931 --> 01:46:28.364
structures or doors.

01:46:28.364 --> 01:46:29.721
TALIESIN: That's a success.

01:46:29.721 --> 01:46:30.816
LIAM: Success!

01:46:30.816 --> 01:46:32.525
MARISHA: Okay, and wait to see--

01:46:32.525 --> 01:46:34.532
BRIAN: Success.

01:46:34.532 --> 01:46:43.374
MARISHA: At the same time, you all get the waft of
honey. It's a little bit tough because there's

01:46:43.374 --> 01:46:51.178
honey all over the place, being that you are near
Fort Lox. It's hard to discern what is wafting in

01:46:51.178 --> 01:47:01.653
from behind you, but with the help over here of
Liam Las Vegas, you get this sweet draft coming

01:47:01.653 --> 01:47:09.650
about-- not too much-- 50 feet in the woods. Not
far from you guys.

01:47:09.650 --> 01:47:12.862
LIAM: Nobody can hide honey from The Sweets
Brothers.

01:47:12.862 --> 01:47:14.220
BRIAN: That's right.

01:47:14.226 --> 01:47:19.010
BRIAN: Yeah, I smell it, too. I think I found the
door, too. I think I know how to get in.

01:47:19.205 --> 01:47:27.887
MARISHA: As you walk closer to the door. You see
sleeping, propped up against it: a ninja bear. A

01:47:27.887 --> 01:47:40.563
member of the Bear Acuda. Looks a little dozy.
He's not anticipating anything. Being a bad guard.

01:47:40.563 --> 01:47:49.027
MATT: Hey, Las Vegas? If I can try and sneak you
up, quietly, how fast do you think you could tear

01:47:49.027 --> 01:47:50.408
the throat out of this ninja?

01:47:50.408 --> 01:47:53.096
LIAM: Tear that motherfucker a new poo hole.

01:47:53.096 --> 01:47:55.208
SAM: In his throat?

01:47:55.237 --> 01:48:00.772
BRIAN: Real fast. I could give him-- How many
claws does a honey badger have?

01:48:00.772 --> 01:48:01.915
SAM: At least three.

01:48:01.915 --> 01:48:04.317
MATT: It has enough claws.

01:48:04.317 --> 01:48:06.629
BRIAN: I could give him three good sized poo
holes.

01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:08.882
SAM: In his throat.

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:13.049
BRIAN: In this throat, of course. Yeah, and then
in his butt when I'm done with his--

01:48:13.049 --> 01:48:15.367
MATT: Give him something to say "oh, bother"
about.

01:48:15.367 --> 01:48:17.617
BRIAN: Yeah, let's do it.

01:48:17.617 --> 01:48:19.130
MATT: I try and sneak him up.

01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:23.598
MARISHA: Okay, roll with advantage because you are
a thief and you're stealthing, I guess.

01:48:23.598 --> 01:48:27.639
MATT: Jump on back. He gets on my back and we're
quietly going through the shadows.

01:48:27.639 --> 01:48:30.548
LIAM: I can see it in my mind's eye.

01:48:30.548 --> 01:48:32.331
MATT: That is a failure.

01:48:32.331 --> 01:48:34.071
MARISHA: Oh, god.

01:48:34.071 --> 01:48:36.203
MATT: Five and a six on a
criminal of four.

01:48:36.203 --> 01:48:46.561
MARISHA: So yeah, you get more frustrated as a
bear. As you're trying to lumber back, you

01:48:46.561 --> 01:48:50.475
don't really anticipate how dense honey
badgers are--

01:48:50.475 --> 01:48:51.715
SAM: You've been working out.

01:48:51.715 --> 01:48:58.337
MARISHA: That squeezing of Liam Las Vegas's thighs
around your midsection squeezed out a fart.

01:48:58.337 --> 01:49:02.431
MATT: It's all that heavy Whitestone food. Sorry.

01:49:02.431 --> 01:49:07.768
MARISHA: About this time, it's not the sound that
alerts the guard.

01:49:07.768 --> 01:49:08.972
MATT: It never is.

01:49:08.972 --> 01:49:19.951
MARISHA: It's the smell. And he, (sniffin.g) "Huh?"
and spots the two of you. You're not far, you're

01:49:19.951 --> 01:49:21.275
ten feet away from him.

01:49:21.275 --> 01:49:23.710
LIAM: Cookie blurts out: Fuck him up, Liam!

01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:26.649
BRIAN: I'm going to somersault towards him and--

01:49:26.649 --> 01:49:27.820
LIAM: Honey badger don't give a shit!

01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.729
BRIAN: Jump up towards his throat with my claws
out.

01:49:29.729 --> 01:49:33.710
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear. You have advantage
because of carnage.

01:49:33.710 --> 01:49:35.573
MATT: Muscle and carnage!

01:49:35.573 --> 01:49:37.146
MARISHA: Oh, muscle and carnage!

01:49:37.152 --> 01:49:39.608
BRIAN: Fail.

01:49:39.608 --> 01:49:41.405
MARISHA: How'd you fail?

01:49:41.405 --> 01:49:43.261
BRIAN: I only have two in bear right now.

01:49:43.463 --> 01:49:47.429
MARISHA: Oh, shit! Well you get more frustrated
because your plan failed and you get a point in

01:49:47.429 --> 01:49:56.910
bear. As you're gauging the trajectory of your
jump, "I'm going to do this awesome flying leap!"

01:49:57.436 --> 01:50:01.119
and as you fly you just fly right past him.
Faceplant.

01:50:01.119 --> 01:50:05.539
MATT: Here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to
quickly try and stealth around him. I have one

01:50:05.539 --> 01:50:13.041
helping of bamboo that I took earlier from that
section. I'm going to try and put it right around

01:50:13.041 --> 01:50:17.119
this guy's face. And turn to Peddy, and try to get
him to eat his face off.

01:50:17.119 --> 01:50:20.224
BRIAN: Well.

01:50:20.224 --> 01:50:21.608
MARISHA: Fascinating.

01:50:21.608 --> 01:50:23.485
BRIAN: That's one way to get him back into meat.

01:50:23.485 --> 01:50:25.194
MARISHA: Roll for criminal, I'm going to say.

01:50:25.194 --> 01:50:26.327
MATT: All right.

01:50:26.327 --> 01:50:27.909
MARISHA: I don't know how stealthy you're being
for this.

01:50:27.909 --> 01:50:30.080
MATT: No, not at all. It's a success!

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.985
MARISHA: Success. Peddy.

01:50:31.985 --> 01:50:37.031
SAM: Oh, I just had the jitters. I'm going to run
at the thing and try to bite its face off!

01:50:37.031 --> 01:50:38.668
MARISHA: Roll for bear with advantage.

01:50:38.668 --> 01:50:41.794
SAM: That's a success.

01:50:41.794 --> 01:50:49.048
MARISHA: As you leap at him, your crazed panda
claws and your soft demeanor is totally

01:50:49.048 --> 01:50:52.017
off-putting. And you go right for this guy's
throat.

01:50:52.017 --> 01:50:56.808
SAM: I'm going to eat through the bamboo and try
to chomp his face to death.

01:50:56.808 --> 01:51:01.408
MARISHA: You succeed. That's gory and impressive.

01:51:01.408 --> 01:51:03.538
BRIAN and MATT: Ew! Oh.

01:51:03.538 --> 01:51:06.485
SAM: I'm going to try and spit out the meat and
keep the bamboo.

01:51:06.485 --> 01:51:07.978
BRIAN: Oh.

01:51:07.978 --> 01:51:10.732
SAM: It's like bloody bamboo.

01:51:10.732 --> 01:51:18.334
MARISHA: You're doing okay. You're holding on, but
the taste of meat, after you're so recently trying

01:51:18.334 --> 01:51:20.268
to cut back is a little rough.

01:51:20.268 --> 01:51:21.657
BRIAN: How you doing?

01:51:21.657 --> 01:51:22.795
SAM: My stomach's churning.

01:51:22.795 --> 01:51:24.498
LIAM: You got a dark side, Tuxpin.

01:51:24.498 --> 01:51:27.900
SAM: We vegans are crazy.

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:30.652
LIAM: Sure enough.

01:51:30.652 --> 01:51:35.350
MARISHA: You now have the corpse of a Bear Acuda
member.

01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:37.172
SAM: I search his body for any items.

01:51:37.172 --> 01:51:39.223
MARISHA: Okay, roll for criminal.

01:51:39.223 --> 01:51:40.890
BRIAN: Is he dressed in a ninja outfit?

01:51:40.890 --> 01:51:42.014
MARISHA: He is.

01:51:42.014 --> 01:51:45.442
SAM: That's a fail. So I lose criminal?

01:51:45.443 --> 01:51:47.234
MATT: Lose criminal, go to bear.

01:51:47.234 --> 01:51:50.996
MARISHA: You are a little too nauseous, you throw
up a little bit, and you have to step away.

01:51:50.996 --> 01:51:52.627
TALIESIN: We're going to strip the bear.

01:51:53.010 --> 01:51:54.793
LIAM: Yeah, strip this bear, I want to put on his
clothes.

01:51:54.793 --> 01:51:56.117
MATT: I was going to say, yeah, give it to him.

01:51:56.117 --> 01:52:01.337
MARISHA: Okay, you strip, you take his clothes.
As you search him, you guys end up finding,

01:52:01.337 --> 01:52:03.055
in one of the pockets--

01:52:03.055 --> 01:52:04.326
LIAM: Oh yeah!

01:52:04.326 --> 01:52:06.167
BRIAN: Nobody else around that we can see or hear,
right?

01:52:06.386 --> 01:52:09.070
LIAM: Between salmon and bamboo.

01:52:09.070 --> 01:52:11.487
BRIAN: Marisha? Nobody else around that we could
see or hear, just the one guard?

01:52:11.487 --> 01:52:13.735
MARISHA: No one thus far, no. You seem to be
alone.

01:52:13.735 --> 01:52:14.994
LIAM: That's it.

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:16.477
SAM: You got a code?

01:52:16.477 --> 01:52:17.855
LIAM and TALIESIN: We got the code.

01:52:17.855 --> 01:52:19.580
SAM: Is it a puzzle or is it just the code?

01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:21.628
LIAM: This dumb fuck has got it in his pocket.

01:52:21.628 --> 01:52:25.809
SAM: Tell me, was the code <i>las mambo</i>?

01:52:25.809 --> 01:52:27.561
TALIESIN: So close.

01:52:27.561 --> 01:52:33.500
LIAM: Instead it is salmon, bamboo, salmon,
salmon, bamboo.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:38.833
MATT: That wasn't bad. It was good, it was right
around. It was barely there.

01:52:38.833 --> 01:52:49.448
LIAM: It's true, it's hard to tell which side is up.
I think this is it. Maybe it's that. There's four options.

01:52:49.448 --> 01:52:51.977
SAM: Wait. Don't the Bear Acuda read backwards though,
on the page?

01:52:52.107 --> 01:52:55.442
LIAM: That's only in their comics.

01:52:55.442 --> 01:52:57.440
SAM: Okay.

01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:01.480
(laughter)

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.268
TALIESIN: They've been flipped.

01:53:03.268 --> 01:53:08.946
MARISHA: Waffle, as you turn around, as you're
looking at this, you see this wooden door that's

01:53:09.005 --> 01:53:16.430
carved into the side of a hill. Encased in stone,
a little bit reinforced with some paving and on

01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:20.324
the side, there's a little keypad box with a cover
over top of it.

01:53:20.324 --> 01:53:26.202
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over, lift the keypad
box.

01:53:26.202 --> 01:53:29.283
MARISHA: There are two buttons, one's a salmon and
one's bamboo.

01:53:29.283 --> 01:53:31.545
LIAM: Keypad.

01:53:31.545 --> 01:53:35.365
MARISHA: And there's a little LED screen up top.

01:53:35.365 --> 01:53:38.029
LIAM: So--

01:53:38.029 --> 01:53:39.208
TALIESIN: I'm thinking!

01:53:39.208 --> 01:53:40.892
LIAM: I mean, I think that--

01:53:40.892 --> 01:53:42.204
TALIESIN: Ah-ah, no. One moment.

01:53:42.204 --> 01:53:43.400
LIAM: You're The Brains.

01:53:45.970 --> 01:53:48.067
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit salmon.

01:53:48.067 --> 01:53:49.147
MARISHA: Okay.

01:53:49.237 --> 01:53:50.506
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit bamboo.

01:53:50.506 --> 01:53:51.884
MARISHA: All right.

01:53:51.884 --> 01:53:57.082
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit salmon. I'm going to
hit bamb-- I'm going to hit salmon.

01:53:57.082 --> 01:53:59.814
I'm going to hit bamboo.

01:53:59.814 --> 01:54:03.003
MARISHA: Bleep, bleep (door unlocking).

01:54:03.003 --> 01:54:04.273
TALIESIN: Gentlemen.

01:54:04.283 --> 01:54:05.843
BRIAN: You fucking genius.

01:54:05.843 --> 01:54:06.608
TALIESIN: We're in.

01:54:06.608 --> 01:54:07.656
MATT: How'd you figure that out?

01:54:07.656 --> 01:54:11.226
SAM: That's amazing code breaking! He's a code
breaker. He's a windtalker.

01:54:11.404 --> 01:54:12.696
TALIESIN: Well I used to be a hacker, to be fair.

01:54:12.696 --> 01:54:14.279
MATT: That's true.

01:54:14.279 --> 01:54:16.176
TALIESIN: You never really stop being a hacker.

01:54:16.176 --> 01:54:19.451
LIAM: By the by, do I look like a ninja and shit
now?

01:54:19.451 --> 01:54:25.189
MARISHA: You do look like a ninja and shit. It's
pretty awesome. Once you're in, you see this long

01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:32.138
corridor that stretches almost as far as you can
see into the darkness. Lining it are dilapidated

01:54:32.138 --> 01:54:38.934
crates and broken glass, many of which have honey
oozing out.

01:54:38.934 --> 01:54:44.761
BRIAN: I walk over and I start wheezing the juice.

01:54:44.761 --> 01:54:50.851
MATT: Las Vegas! Stay focused.

01:54:50.948 --> 01:54:54.005
BRIAN: There's honey dripping out of the walls
here, man!

01:54:54.005 --> 01:54:58.512
MATT: I understand, but this is shitty, outside
quality honey. We want the good stuff that's

01:54:58.512 --> 01:54:59.934
hidden inside.

01:54:59.934 --> 01:55:01.334
BRIAN: Ugh, fine.

01:55:01.334 --> 01:55:02.379
MATT: Stay on target.

01:55:02.379 --> 01:55:03.723
BRIAN: All right, let's go.

01:55:03.747 --> 01:55:10.461
MARISHA: You also see a few wheelbarrow wheels,
cartwheels, a few broken down

01:55:10.485 --> 01:55:12.598
wheelbarrows and carts themselves.

01:55:12.598 --> 01:55:14.585
TALIESIN: These guys have been collecting wheels!

01:55:14.585 --> 01:55:17.367
SAM: I think I could fashion something out of
these.

01:55:17.367 --> 01:55:19.450
LIAM: Is there enough pieces to put together,
something like that?

01:55:19.450 --> 01:55:20.564
TALIESIN: It's looking like enough wheels.

01:55:20.564 --> 01:55:26.796
SAM: Yeah, but it's a narrow corridor, so it's not
going to be a cart. I'm going to make us a really

01:55:26.796 --> 01:55:28.432
long motorcycle.

01:55:28.432 --> 01:55:30.817
LIAM: Like a tandem bike?

01:55:30.817 --> 01:55:38.166
SAM: Kind of like tandem bike, with five wheels.
Like a Tron bike, sort of, with extra wheels.

01:55:38.166 --> 01:55:40.682
BRIAN: What if we have to turn around? We're going
to be doing the--

01:55:40.682 --> 01:55:42.404
MATT: Don't worry about that!

01:55:42.404 --> 01:55:44.874
TALIESIN: It's a good plan.

01:55:44.874 --> 01:55:46.420
SAM: We got to get in first.

01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:52.284
LIAM: Yeah, and Trinket's been hanging out with
what's-his-face, that guy. He's half an albino.

01:55:52.324 --> 01:55:54.248
TALIESIN: Quincy.

01:55:54.248 --> 01:55:57.431
LIAM: Quincy! Yeah, the detective. He makes
stuff.

01:55:57.431 --> 01:55:59.150
TALIESIN: Quincy de Bolo, you know?

01:55:59.150 --> 01:56:01.088
LIAM: So you could give some advice, maybe.

01:56:01.088 --> 01:56:06.972
SAM: Oh, Quincy de Bolo, yeah. All right, let me
see if I can make this contraption.

01:56:07.203 --> 01:56:09.419
MATT: I can help you out. I've seen him making a
few crazy things.

01:56:09.419 --> 01:56:10.595
SAM: Okay, with your help.

01:56:10.595 --> 01:56:15.156
BRIAN: If you need me to bend anything, I've got
these now, I've got these.

01:56:15.156 --> 01:56:18.818
SAM: I might need you to bed a couple of iron rods
around, axles and stuff.

01:56:18.818 --> 01:56:22.569
MARISHA: Okay, I'll say each one of you make a
check.

01:56:22.569 --> 01:56:26.295
LIAM: Make a Bolo check.

01:56:26.295 --> 01:56:29.093
MARISHA: With advantage, since you're all doing
your skills.

01:56:29.093 --> 01:56:33.229
SAM: This isn't an inherent bear skill.

01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:35.004
MARISHA: This isn't a bear thing, this is a
criminal thing, yeah.

01:56:35.004 --> 01:56:36.741
BRIAN: Success.

01:56:36.741 --> 01:56:38.619
TALIESIN: This is a Bolo thing.

01:56:38.619 --> 01:56:40.971
LIAM: When are bolos going to come back into
fashion?

01:56:41.290 --> 01:56:42.925
MATT: Success.

01:56:42.925 --> 01:56:45.514
MARISHA: Okay! I'm just going to do two out of
three.

01:56:45.514 --> 01:56:46.647
SAM: Oh, good!

01:56:46.647 --> 01:56:49.908
MARISHA: You're a little bingey still, a little
tweaky.

01:56:49.908 --> 01:56:53.341
SAM: There's a little blood residue. I don't like
it.

01:56:53.341 --> 01:57:01.386
MARISHA: Yeah, you're doing okay. With what you
know about carts and motorcycles, you're able to

01:57:01.386 --> 01:57:08.016
figure it out and, luckily, with Percy as your
patron saint right now.

01:57:08.016 --> 01:57:09.479
MATT and TALIESIN: Quincy!

01:57:09.479 --> 01:57:12.253
MARISHA: Quincy de Bolo. Quincy with a bolo.

01:57:12.253 --> 01:57:14.536
BRIAN: Quincy de Bolo instead of Percy de Rolo?

01:57:14.806 --> 01:57:17.026
MARISHA: Yeah, it's that guy, that we all know and
love.

01:57:17.026 --> 01:57:18.776
LIAM: Welcome to 90 seconds ago, Las Vegas.

01:57:18.776 --> 01:57:23.146
BRIAN: Listen, I've been drinking since last
Tuesday.

01:57:23.146 --> 01:57:26.171
MARISHA: It is not motorized, you all have to
pedal, though.

01:57:26.171 --> 01:57:27.784
SAM: Yes, Flintstones style!

01:57:27.784 --> 01:57:29.593
MARISHA: Flintstones style, all in a line.

01:57:29.593 --> 01:57:34.028
MATT: Look, you can't build something unique like
this and not give it a name.

01:57:34.028 --> 01:57:36.063
TALIESIN: You need to name it.

01:57:36.063 --> 01:57:37.272
SAM: Oh, boy.

01:57:37.272 --> 01:57:41.523
MATT: I suggest Good Tidings.

01:57:41.523 --> 01:57:47.143
SAM: That's pretty good. Okay, we'll call it Good
Tidings.

01:57:47.143 --> 01:57:49.344
TALIESIN: Good Tidings, all right.

01:57:49.344 --> 01:57:53.261
SAM: Yeah. I'm going to ride in the front, so I
can steer. I think it's a Christmas thing, I don't

01:57:53.528 --> 01:58:00.392
really know. We'll all get on. There's enough
seats for all of us except you, Las Vegas, I'm

01:58:00.392 --> 01:58:03.112
sorry. You'll have to ride on somebody's
shoulders.

01:58:03.112 --> 01:58:05.244
BRIAN: That's okay. I'll ride on Trinket's
shoulders.

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:08.385
SAM: Okay, we all have to pedal with our feet?

01:58:08.385 --> 01:58:09.771
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:58:09.771 --> 01:58:15.258
SAM: All right, there's one more thing! The only
way this thing works is if we all go like this

01:58:15.258 --> 01:58:18.997
(motorcycle imitation) at the same time, or else
it won't go.

01:58:19.245 --> 01:58:20.748
LIAM: Seem strange, but--

01:58:20.748 --> 01:58:22.137
MATT: You're the one who built this.

01:58:22.137 --> 01:58:24.112
LIAM: I don't question scientists.

01:58:24.112 --> 01:58:26.029
SAM: Ready?

01:58:26.029 --> 01:58:27.953
MARISHA: It's a long corridor. You guys have to--

01:58:27.953 --> 01:58:29.265
SAM: Deep breath!

01:58:29.265 --> 01:58:30.453
MATT: Get on, Las Vegas, get on.

01:58:30.453 --> 01:58:35.447
SAM: On a count of three! One, two, three.

01:58:35.447 --> 01:58:48.808
(motorcycle imitations)

01:58:48.808 --> 01:58:51.262
MARISHA: In about that time--

01:58:51.262 --> 01:58:55.084
(laughter)

01:58:55.084 --> 01:59:07.816
As you guys reach a fork in the corridor, the very
abrasive noise you were making alerts two ninjas.

01:59:07.851 --> 01:59:09.875
BRIAN: Son of a bitch!

01:59:09.875 --> 01:59:11.976
MARISHA: And they drop down.

01:59:12.174 --> 01:59:17.918
BRIAN: I'll jump off Trinket and try and attack
the one on the left.

01:59:17.918 --> 01:59:23.703
MARISHA: Okay, Las Vegas is taking the one on the
right. There's a fork, so there's two guarding each

01:59:23.703 --> 01:59:28.949
corridor. Las Vegas is taking the one on the right.
Roll with advantage for your carnage.

01:59:28.967 --> 01:59:30.814
BRIAN: Is this criminal or bear?

01:59:30.978 --> 01:59:32.297
MARISHA: This is bear, you're going full--

01:59:32.297 --> 01:59:33.865
BRIAN: Fail.

01:59:33.865 --> 01:59:36.527
MARISHA: Ugh, okay, you get more frustrated. Take
a point in bear.

01:59:36.527 --> 01:59:38.562
BRIAN: Fuck!

01:59:38.562 --> 01:59:43.343
MARISHA: Poor Las Vegas! The bears are just too
quick, they saw you coming, and one of them goes

01:59:43.343 --> 01:59:46.116
(kicking) and punts Las Vegas out of the way.

01:59:46.116 --> 01:59:50.718
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw my bowler, like a
James Bond villain, ninja-style.

01:59:50.718 --> 01:59:53.807
MARISHA: Okay, are you taking the one that Liam's
taking?

01:59:53.807 --> 01:59:55.024
TALIESIN: No, I'm taking the other one.

01:59:55.024 --> 01:59:58.290
MARISHA: Okay roll-- what was your skill?

01:59:58.290 --> 02:00:00.540
TALIESIN: I have honey sense.

02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:06.613
MARISHA: Honey sense, but you're The Brains. Roll
for criminal, I think.

02:00:06.613 --> 02:00:10.195
TALIESIN: Roll for criminal. Success.

02:00:10.195 --> 02:00:17.379
MARISHA: You ping one right off the top of his
head. You papercut his eyes a little bit,

02:00:17.379 --> 02:00:19.751
and he's like, "Ow! What? How?!"

02:00:19.751 --> 02:00:23.180
TALIESIN: There's more where that came-- There's
not more. I had one hat. I'm not sure what to do now.

02:00:23.187 --> 02:00:25.623
MARISHA: "Ugh, you got me right in the eye!"

02:00:25.657 --> 02:00:28.747
LIAM: I'm not an expert, but I'm coming to my
brother's defense. I'm going to nut-punch him!

02:00:28.933 --> 02:00:30.285
MARISHA: Roll for bear.

02:00:30.285 --> 02:00:32.111
LIAM: Success!

02:00:32.111 --> 02:00:37.380
MARISHA: As he is holding his eye he goes
(grunting). It's like a Three Stooges movie. He

02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:41.907
goes down. He's not taken out, but he is a little
incapacitated.

02:00:41.907 --> 02:00:47.542
MATT: I'm seeing all this and the urge to tear
into this comes into me. I need to get myself up

02:00:47.542 --> 02:00:52.072
and mentally ready for this, so I scoop down into
my pocket and pull out a thing of honey and start

02:00:52.072 --> 02:00:53.598
devouring it feverishly.

02:00:53.598 --> 02:00:56.848
MARISHA: Okay, while you do that, what are you
doing, Peddy?

02:00:56.848 --> 02:01:02.260
SAM: I'm going to remember back to when we had
just played that board game.

02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:05.174
MARISHA: Flashback. (warbling)

02:01:05.174 --> 02:01:10.336
SAM: When I had just said to the gentleman: Your
dick is just below average. When he looked down is

02:01:10.336 --> 02:01:16.075
when I swiped one of the pieces of the board game,
one of the ice chunks. I've been concealing it

02:01:16.075 --> 02:01:17.649
this whole time.

02:01:17.649 --> 02:01:20.845
MARISHA: (slowly) "Only when the temperature's
below average."

02:01:20.845 --> 02:01:23.217
SAM: (slowly) It's okay.

02:01:23.217 --> 02:01:27.796
MARISHA: You have a board game piece.

02:01:27.796 --> 02:01:29.848
SAM: I'm going to throw a board game piece at the
other guy!

02:01:29.848 --> 02:01:34.165
MARISHA: At the one that he's attacking? Okay.
Roll for criminal.

02:01:34.165 --> 02:01:37.413
MATT: Which you got a point back for.

02:01:37.413 --> 02:01:42.312
SAM: Yeah, I got a point back for the flashback.
Okay. That's still a fail!

02:01:42.312 --> 02:01:45.957
MATT, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Back to bear!

02:01:45.957 --> 02:01:49.852
BRIAN: It's hard to roll below two, three. Ugh.

02:01:49.852 --> 02:01:53.990
MARISHA: These are crazy bears, he goes (pinging).
Wax on!

02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:55.657
SAM: Oh, man!

02:01:55.657 --> 02:01:59.405
MARISHA: Then he's looking right at you. Trinket,
you've downed your honey?

02:01:59.405 --> 02:02:05.903
MATT: (growling) I have honey foam gathering at
the corners of my bear mouth. (growling) Not

02:02:05.903 --> 02:02:10.433
wanting to call too much attention, I go up
towards the one that just deflected it and thrust

02:02:10.433 --> 02:02:15.287
him against the wall and put my arms up there
pinning him. I go: You're going to die, sucker.

02:02:15.287 --> 02:02:18.078
And try to get him to piss himself and drop his
guard.

02:02:18.078 --> 02:02:19.529
MARISHA: Roll twice for terrify.

02:02:19.529 --> 02:02:22.987
MATT: Success!

02:02:22.987 --> 02:02:29.699
MARISHA: He goes (whimpering) and you feel a
little warmth on your paw.

02:02:29.699 --> 02:02:35.112
BRIAN: While he's pinned up against the wall, can
I try and jump from between Trinket and him and

02:02:35.112 --> 02:02:38.602
shove my claws up through, under here?

02:02:38.602 --> 02:02:43.184
MARISHA: You may, and you have advantage as he is
pinned, and for your carnage.

02:02:43.184 --> 02:02:44.870
BRIAN: He dead.

02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:54.692
MARISHA: With that, Trinket, all you see is his
eyes go (popping) a little bit as two of Liam Las

02:02:54.692 --> 02:03:00.965
Vegas's claws go up through the back of his head
and into his sinuses. A little bit of tears of

02:03:00.965 --> 02:03:06.735
blood come streaming down his face. He (chokes)
and slumps down.

02:03:06.735 --> 02:03:09.523
BRIAN: As he's dying, I say: (whispering) Welcome
to fabulous Las Vegas.

02:03:09.523 --> 02:03:13.153
(laughter)

02:03:13.153 --> 02:03:18.991
MATT: As he pulls his claw out of the head, I go:
Told you. I step away.

02:03:19.267 --> 02:03:23.009
MARISHA: He slumps down. You still have one more
on you guys' side.

02:03:23.009 --> 02:03:25.201
TALIESIN: Let's keep one for questioning.

02:03:25.201 --> 02:03:27.386
MARISHA: That was awesome. Wait, what?

02:03:27.386 --> 02:03:29.569
TALIESIN: We're going to incapacitate this one.

02:03:29.569 --> 02:03:31.671
MARISHA: Okay, and go for questioning. Is that
what you said?

02:03:31.671 --> 02:03:35.735
LIAM: What I'm going to do is-- I remember all
those Beauregard comic books I read as a kid, and

02:03:35.735 --> 02:03:41.778
I'm going to take him around the neck. I'm going
to bear-kour across the wall and then try to slam

02:03:41.778 --> 02:03:46.786
downward and bring him down to the ground so that
Waffle can question him.

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:48.224
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

02:03:48.224 --> 02:03:50.073
TALIESIN: A bear hug, I imagine.

02:03:50.073 --> 02:03:51.009
LIAM: That's a success.

02:03:51.009 --> 02:03:59.870
MARISHA: You bear hug him right around his throat
and he just, "Oh god!" He collapses right down.

02:03:59.870 --> 02:04:01.112
You are on--

02:04:01.112 --> 02:04:03.060
MATT: Success means you move to criminal.

02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:05.479
MARISHA: Yes, success move from bear to criminal.

02:04:05.479 --> 02:04:08.261
LIAM: I was in it, Matt. I was in it!

02:04:08.261 --> 02:04:17.247
MARISHA: It's like a wrestling pose. You are right
on top, and he's stuck. Whatever you want to do.

02:04:17.247 --> 02:04:18.504
LIAM: He's all yours, bro-bro!

02:04:18.504 --> 02:04:20.433
TALIESIN: Where's the honey?

02:04:20.433 --> 02:04:29.305
MARISHA: "Look, man. There's a few safes all
around, but Hattori's moved most of it to his own

02:04:29.305 --> 02:04:30.723
"office and his own personal stash."

02:04:30.723 --> 02:04:32.665
TALIESIN: How do we get there?

02:04:32.886 --> 02:04:38.619
MARISHA: "Okay. You're going to go down this left
passageway. You're going to get to your first

02:04:38.619 --> 02:04:40.125
"right, you're going to take that--"

02:04:40.125 --> 02:04:42.231
TALIESIN: Hold on, I have to write this down. Hold
on. Okay, left passageway.

02:04:42.305 --> 02:04:45.112
MARISHA: "Left passageway. Your first right."

02:04:45.197 --> 02:04:46.483
TALIESIN: First right.

02:04:46.483 --> 02:04:47.839
MARISHA: "Second left."

02:04:47.839 --> 02:04:48.562
TALIESIN: Second left.

02:04:48.562 --> 02:04:52.400
MARISHA: At the end of that corridor, you'll see
his hideout.

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.227
SAM: Is he wearing ninja clothes?

02:04:54.227 --> 02:04:54.974
MARISHA: He is.

02:04:54.974 --> 02:04:56.497
SAM: We're going to need one more thing from you.

02:04:56.497 --> 02:04:57.836
MARISHA: "What?"

02:04:57.836 --> 02:04:59.311
SAM: Take off your clothes.

02:04:59.311 --> 02:05:01.264
MARISHA: "What?!"

02:05:01.323 --> 02:05:05.413
MATT: I lean in. (growling) Take off your
clothes.

02:05:05.443 --> 02:05:06.493
MARISHA: "Okay."

02:05:06.738 --> 02:05:08.505
LIAM: Don't worry. It's just the tap.

02:05:08.505 --> 02:05:11.157
MARISHA: "I don't know what that means."

02:05:11.157 --> 02:05:12.218
MATT: Oh, you will.

02:05:12.218 --> 02:05:14.587
MARISHA: "Just don't kill me. Will you not tell?"

02:05:14.587 --> 02:05:16.037
LIAM: You will if they meet their goal.

02:05:16.037 --> 02:05:21.041
MARISHA: "Just don't tell Bongo about this,
okay?"

02:05:21.041 --> 02:05:22.178
SAM: Give me those.

02:05:22.178 --> 02:05:23.241
MARISHA: "Okay."

02:05:23.241 --> 02:05:24.569
SAM: I start ripping them to shreds.

02:05:24.569 --> 02:05:31.100
MARISHA: "Look. I don't know if you guys are
with that Yak guy, but I didn't hurt him, okay?

02:05:31.403 --> 02:05:32.466
"I wasn't the one who--"

02:05:32.466 --> 02:05:33.647
BRIAN: Where is he?

02:05:33.647 --> 02:05:35.044
MATT and BRIAN: Is he alive?

02:05:35.044 --> 02:05:36.299
MARISHA: "Yeah, he's alive."

02:05:36.299 --> 02:05:37.345
BRIAN: Where?

02:05:37.345 --> 02:05:42.244
MARISHA: "Okay, you know how you go down that
left corridor, and you take that right, and then there

02:05:42.244 --> 02:05:46.297
"was the second left? If you keep going past that
second left and you keep going all the way down,

02:05:46.488 --> 02:05:49.872
"there's two more rights. You're once again going
to take that second right."

02:05:49.872 --> 02:05:51.161
TALIESIN: Oh, the second right.

02:05:51.161 --> 02:05:55.453
MARISHA: "Yeah. He's not far, though. It's just
two doors down. Yeah."

02:05:55.453 --> 02:05:58.016
TALIESIN: That's very specific. This is good.

02:05:58.016 --> 02:05:59.522
MARISHA: "Okay, thank you. It's a big fort."

02:05:59.522 --> 02:06:00.700
LIAM: We good here, Waffle?

02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:01.887
TALIESIN: I think we're good here.

02:06:01.887 --> 02:06:04.001
MARISHA: "Can I run away and will you guys not say
anything?"

02:06:04.001 --> 02:06:05.895
LIAM: I tap him in the nose and choke him out.

02:06:06.139 --> 02:06:07.747
MARISHA: (choking)

02:06:07.747 --> 02:06:13.365
TALIESIN: (shushing) Go to sleep. There will be
waffles in the morning, go to sleep.

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:16.419
(laughter)

02:06:16.419 --> 02:06:18.483
SAM: The Sweet Brothers are stone cold.

02:06:18.483 --> 02:06:20.743
MATT: It's been a rough seven months for these
two.

02:06:20.743 --> 02:06:23.071
TALIESIN: Shit got dark, man.

02:06:23.071 --> 02:06:25.801
LIAM: I'm not fucking going back to prison, all
right?

02:06:25.801 --> 02:06:27.023
TALIESIN: Never again.

02:06:27.023 --> 02:06:29.578
SAM: That was the zoo.

02:06:29.578 --> 02:06:38.365
BRIAN: Before we leave this hallway, I'm going to
dip my paw and my nail into some of his friend's

02:06:38.365 --> 02:06:41.239
blood, and I'm going to draw a dick on his cheek
while he's asleep.

02:06:41.258 --> 02:06:46.128
MATT: The one that he killed? I'm going to take
off his ninja clothes and put that on me.

02:06:46.373 --> 02:06:47.790
To help me with my thieving shit.

02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:49.171
MARISHA: We got three ninjas.

02:06:49.171 --> 02:06:53.096
SAM: Are you okay, Trinket? You're shaking a
little bit. You look a little crazy right now.

02:06:53.096 --> 02:06:58.079
MATT: Sorry, it's just hard to bear all this
violence around me.

02:06:58.319 --> 02:07:02.471
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to scrape a little
honey off the wall and give myself--

02:07:02.471 --> 02:07:04.652
MATT: Actually, that's not a bad idea. I'm going
to eat one of my honey as well.

02:07:04.652 --> 02:07:07.702
MARISHA: Okay. You guys have plenty of honey that
you have stocked up on, so if anyone--

02:07:07.702 --> 02:07:09.787
LIAM: While they do that, I'm going to practice my
capo-bear-a moves.

02:07:09.787 --> 02:07:14.703
BRIAN: I'll eat some honey too. That moves a
criminal to bear, right?

02:07:14.703 --> 02:07:18.895
MARISHA: Yeah, if you eat a lot of honey, you move
a point from criminal to bear.

02:07:18.895 --> 02:07:28.300
SAM: Mount up, everybody. I've invented something.
Put these wads of fabric in your mouth. They're mufflers.

02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:32.372
BRIAN: Please tell me this has a better name than
the (muffled).

02:07:32.372 --> 02:07:36.462
SAM: We still got to make the sound, but now it
will be quiet.

02:07:36.462 --> 02:07:40.247
(muffled speaking)

02:07:40.247 --> 02:07:41.756
MATT: (muffled) Hop on!

02:07:41.756 --> 02:07:42.779
SAM: (muffled) We're riding out!

02:07:42.779 --> 02:07:44.263
LIAM: (muffled) Let's do this shit!

02:07:44.263 --> 02:07:49.327
(muffled motorcycle imitations)

02:07:49.327 --> 02:07:56.917
MARISHA: You head down the left corridor. You take
the first right. You're coming up, and you take

02:07:57.312 --> 02:08:04.307
that second left. And you keep going. You're going
to Kody Yak's? Or you're going to Hattori Bongo?

02:08:04.307 --> 02:08:11.364
The first-- Kody Yak? Okay. You keep going past,
you have a little debate, and then you go past a

02:08:11.364 --> 02:08:12.900
cell, a little door.

02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:14.299
SAM: (braking sound effect)

02:08:14.299 --> 02:08:16.780
(spitting and coughing)

02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.348
TALIESIN: I think my muffler is broken.

02:08:19.348 --> 02:08:20.754
SAM: Very uncomfortable.

02:08:20.754 --> 02:08:22.537
LIAM: I felt like Vinnie the Pooh for a second
there.

02:08:22.537 --> 02:08:33.996
MARISHA: As you pull up, you hear someone go, "Is
someone there? I hear something."

02:08:33.996 --> 02:08:36.502
BRIAN: Kody, is that you?

02:08:36.502 --> 02:08:38.754
MARISHA: "That's not my name anymore."

02:08:38.754 --> 02:08:43.136
BRIAN: Guy who used to be Kody, is that you?

02:08:43.136 --> 02:08:45.410
MARISHA: "Yeah, that's me."

02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:47.134
BRIAN: What's your name? Is it Reek?

02:08:47.134 --> 02:08:51.680
MATT: Is it the bear formerly known as Kody?

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:54.885
BRIAN: Bear formerly known as Kody Yak!

02:08:54.885 --> 02:08:57.701
MARISHA: "They changed my name to Wagyu."

02:08:57.701 --> 02:08:59.818
BRIAN: Wagyu?

02:08:59.818 --> 02:09:03.924
MARISHA: "Yeah. I don't know."

02:09:03.924 --> 02:09:05.519
SAM: Is that a cow thing? What is that?

02:09:05.519 --> 02:09:07.118
BRIAN: Is that a cow? Wagyu?

02:09:07.118 --> 02:09:11.750
MARISHA: "I feel like I'm their prized meat."

02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:13.582
BRIAN: Have they been eating you?!

02:09:13.833 --> 02:09:18.397
MARISHA: "No, they're just been training me to
help Hattori Bongo."

02:09:18.397 --> 02:09:20.139
LIAM: Training you how?

02:09:20.139 --> 02:09:21.644
MARISHA: "Are you with Tova?"

02:09:21.644 --> 02:09:23.363
ALL: Yes.

02:09:23.363 --> 02:09:28.513
MARISHA: "Okay. Please. If you let me out I'll
help you. I'll help you fight him."

02:09:28.513 --> 02:09:30.112
SAM: How do we break open this door?

02:09:30.112 --> 02:09:31.032
BRIAN: How do we let him out?

02:09:31.032 --> 02:09:35.362
MATT: I got this, don't worry. I pull out my meat
tenderizer thieves' tools.

02:09:35.362 --> 02:09:36.739
LIAM: The Nutcracker.

02:09:36.739 --> 02:09:40.265
MATT: (laughing) And fucking bust the shit out of
this, like a thief does.

02:09:40.265 --> 02:09:42.096
MARISHA: (clanging)

02:09:42.096 --> 02:09:43.804
SAM: Put a muffler on it!

02:09:43.804 --> 02:09:47.342
MARISHA: (muffled clanging)

02:09:47.342 --> 02:09:48.838
SAM: Oh, it worked!

02:09:48.838 --> 02:09:54.538
MARISHA: Roll for thief? Lock picking.

02:09:54.555 --> 02:09:56.093
MATT: Success.

02:09:56.093 --> 02:10:01.820
MARISHA: With a few blows, you eventually bend the
lock to where you can get in.

02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:04.653
MATT: See, a little finesse doesn't hurt.

02:10:04.653 --> 02:10:15.269
MARISHA: Out steps this man who's been half in the
Bear Acuda colors, the scraps tied around him,

02:10:15.269 --> 02:10:24.710
giant horns. He's a yak. He's definitely a big
yak. He comes out, he's hunched. But as he

02:10:24.710 --> 02:10:32.754
straightens as he gets out of the cell, you can
see that on his hind legs he stands about your

02:10:32.754 --> 02:10:35.699
guys' height, but he seems a little bigger with
the giant yak horns.

02:10:35.699 --> 02:10:37.117
TALIESIN: Yakety-yak.

02:10:37.117 --> 02:10:42.257
BRIAN: Do we have anything that could maybe
strengthen him or, you know, make him feel better

02:10:42.257 --> 02:10:44.229
so we have another person to help us fight?

02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:45.611
TALIESIN: Yak yak or something?

02:10:45.611 --> 02:10:48.707
LIAM: You like honey, Kody?

02:10:48.707 --> 02:10:50.589
MARISHA: "No, not really."

02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:52.194
BRIAN: Maybe some Yak in the Box? Do we have
anything--

02:10:52.194 --> 02:10:53.549
MARISHA: "I like grassy things."

02:10:53.549 --> 02:10:55.038
TALIESIN: We could have stopped for something.

02:10:55.038 --> 02:10:57.101
LIAM: Hey, you got any bamboo left?

02:10:57.101 --> 02:11:01.268
SAM: I got a little bit. Do you like bamboo? It's
kind of like--

02:11:01.268 --> 02:11:03.846
MARISHA: "Yeah, it's a little sweet for me, but I
like it all right."

02:11:03.846 --> 02:11:06.349
TALIESIN: I got a bit of the flowers. I took a
couple of flowers from the--

02:11:06.349 --> 02:11:08.118
BRIAN: The cakes! You put the cakes under your
hat.

02:11:08.118 --> 02:11:10.881
MARISHA: Shaking, he desperately shoves it in his
face.

02:11:10.881 --> 02:11:12.268
LIAM: Pass the hat, guys.

02:11:12.268 --> 02:11:14.138
SAM: I got no more bamboo left, though.

02:11:14.138 --> 02:11:19.481
MARISHA: "He's been training me. He's got these
code words."

02:11:19.481 --> 02:11:20.993
BRIAN: What code words?

02:11:20.993 --> 02:11:24.010
MARISHA: "I don't know, I could never remember
them."

02:11:24.010 --> 02:11:25.186
BRIAN: What did they do?

02:11:25.186 --> 02:11:26.809
TALIESIN: Well then he's not training you very
well then, is he?

02:11:26.809 --> 02:11:32.623
MARISHA: "I just go blind. I just go after them,
and he's been trying to make these new

02:11:32.623 --> 02:11:36.585
"contraptions. I don't know, I think they're around
here somewhere."

02:11:36.585 --> 02:11:38.021
BRIAN: What do they do?

02:11:38.021 --> 02:11:39.471
MATT: Can you lead us to them?

02:11:39.471 --> 02:11:46.001
MARISHA: "I don't know, there's stuff hidden all over
the place. I'd never seen anything like them before."

02:11:46.001 --> 02:11:47.507
BRIAN: Are they traps?

02:11:47.507 --> 02:11:55.135
MARISHA: "No, they make loud booming noises.
They're shiny. And people use them--"

02:11:55.135 --> 02:11:58.978
MATT: Show me. I think I may have seen some of
these before.

02:11:58.978 --> 02:12:07.283
MARISHA: He leads you down that first corridor
that you guys passed to get to him. You go wrap

02:12:07.283 --> 02:12:11.983
around to the right and you see the storage room
that's filled with crates.

02:12:11.983 --> 02:12:14.657
BRIAN: What's in the crates?

02:12:14.657 --> 02:12:23.958
MARISHA: Make a search. You're going to have to
destroy the crates first, so I'd say make a bear

02:12:23.958 --> 02:12:29.257
check with advantage for carnage. You make a
straight roll for bear.

02:12:29.257 --> 02:12:30.530
BRIAN: Success.

02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:31.736
MATT: Fail!

02:12:31.736 --> 02:12:37.759
MARISHA: Luckily, Liam Las Vegas just tears into
the first one with full-on alcoholic rage. Just

02:12:37.759 --> 02:12:43.365
gnaws the corner off, it's crazy.

02:12:43.365 --> 02:12:44.782
BRIAN: I've been doing Bear-90-X.

02:12:44.782 --> 02:12:47.006
MATT: I can tell, you've been making the beavers
jealous.

02:12:47.006 --> 02:12:52.617
BRIAN: Yeah, well I make all the beavers jealous
where I'm from. I also make them happy.

02:12:52.617 --> 02:12:54.224
SAM: How?

02:12:54.224 --> 02:12:55.637
BRIAN: How?

02:12:55.637 --> 02:12:57.651
SAM: Yes, how do you make the beavers happy?

02:12:57.651 --> 02:12:59.228
BRIAN: By being chivalrous.

02:12:59.228 --> 02:13:02.752
SAM: Oh! That's what everyone wants, just a nice
guy.

02:13:02.752 --> 02:13:04.130
TALIESIN: You get that from the B-90-X?

02:13:04.130 --> 02:13:06.289
BRIAN: I leave their whores-- their holes alone.

02:13:06.289 --> 02:13:11.341
LIAM: You failed twice! In one second!

02:13:11.341 --> 02:13:13.626
TALIESIN: That was amazing. That was a double
fail.

02:13:13.949 --> 02:13:18.934
BRIAN: I've never felt worse about saying something
while sitting next to Matt Mercer in my life.

02:13:18.934 --> 02:13:21.646
LIAM: To be fair, you haven't slept in 36 hours.

02:13:21.646 --> 02:13:23.580
BRIAN: That's definitely true.

02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:25.339
TALIESIN: I feel like that deserves a point in
bear.

02:13:25.339 --> 02:13:28.845
SAM: We're looking for something loud and shiny,
right?

02:13:28.845 --> 02:13:29.863
BRIAN: Yeah.

02:13:29.863 --> 02:13:37.466
MARISHA: As you tear into the first crate that you
find, you find tiny shiny things. You open a

02:13:37.466 --> 02:13:47.593
little bit of a box and you find, not a lot of it
looks functional, but you find one shiny ball.

02:13:47.603 --> 02:13:48.543
BRIAN: Interesting.

02:13:48.806 --> 02:13:50.754
TALIESIN: That could be useful.

02:13:50.754 --> 02:13:52.159
MARISHA: There are a few more crates.

02:13:52.159 --> 02:13:53.689
TALIESIN: I'm going to tear into a crate.

02:13:53.689 --> 02:13:55.228
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

02:13:55.228 --> 02:13:56.635
LIAM: First it's dicks, now it's balls.

02:13:56.635 --> 02:13:58.667
TALIESIN: That's a fail.

02:13:58.667 --> 02:14:00.790
SAM: I'm going to open a crate or two.

02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:07.166
MARISHA: Unfortunately, Waffle, you try to punch a
crate and it's a little too hard for you.

02:14:07.166 --> 02:14:11.479
SAM: I'm going to sit on a crate, see if I can
open it with my panda weight.

02:14:11.479 --> 02:14:13.196
MARISHA: Roll for bear.

02:14:13.196 --> 02:14:14.279
SAM: That's a success.

02:14:14.279 --> 02:14:23.201
MARISHA: This one that you're going after crushes
in. You succeed so you go from bear to criminal.

02:14:23.201 --> 02:14:24.911
SAM: Oh, go from bear to criminal.

02:14:24.911 --> 02:14:32.444
MARISHA: Succeeding goes from bear to criminal.
Failing goes from criminal to bear, no matter the

02:14:32.444 --> 02:14:39.686
stat you roll. As the crate breaks in, you feel
this thing jam up right into your left cheek.

02:14:39.686 --> 02:14:42.258
SAM: Ugh! I got something here, guys!

02:14:42.258 --> 02:14:44.736
MARISHA: It's like a pipe-shaped thing.

02:14:44.736 --> 02:14:46.381
SAM: You're The Brains, look at this thing.

02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:47.475
TALIESIN: What is this thing?

02:14:47.475 --> 02:14:50.236
MATT: You might want to clean it off first.

02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:53.411
LIAM: What the heck is that?

02:14:53.441 --> 02:14:55.479
MATT: I know exactly what that is.

02:14:55.721 --> 02:14:56.870
SAM: That's a hookah pipe.

02:14:56.870 --> 02:15:01.490
MATT: That's what my papa in law is now producing.
No.

02:15:01.490 --> 02:15:04.707
BRIAN: I think that might be a Hattori bong.

02:15:04.707 --> 02:15:06.269
LIAM: Oh.

02:15:06.269 --> 02:15:15.583
MATT: Be careful with that. No! Don't point it
towards your face. Hey, hand it here. Here's the

02:15:15.583 --> 02:15:21.994
thing, I've watched papa-in-law do this a bunch.
You take one of the small shinies and you put it

02:15:21.994 --> 02:15:24.105
inside the big long shiny.

02:15:24.105 --> 02:15:26.011
TALIESIN: Now it's stuck in the--

02:15:26.011 --> 02:15:33.521
MATT: You pull back and when you let go, boom! It
puts a hole in what's right next to you.

02:15:33.521 --> 02:15:36.507
LIAM: Like it sends out a stick?

02:15:36.507 --> 02:15:40.952
MATT: Kind of, yeah. It makes a lot of hurty-hurt
on the thing that's right there.

02:15:40.952 --> 02:15:43.081
TALIESIN: So you can use it to send a message or
something?

02:15:43.081 --> 02:15:44.800
MATT: Yeah, a message that will kill it.

02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:46.425
TALIESIN and LIAM: Wow.

02:15:46.425 --> 02:15:47.597
MATT: Be careful with that.

02:15:47.597 --> 02:15:48.543
LIAM: Powerful words.

02:15:48.543 --> 02:15:55.034
SAM: Hey, listen, he's got the right to bear arms,
it's okay. He can do it.

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:56.334
LIAM: We're so sorry.

02:15:56.334 --> 02:16:01.050
MARISHA: There's a few more crates you guys can
search if you want.

02:16:01.050 --> 02:16:03.852
BRIAN: Do you guys want to search any more
crates?

02:16:03.852 --> 02:16:10.720
LIAM: Yes, I would like to do my best imitation
of the hairless bears-- also known as people--

02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:13.907
and lift the lid off of one with my claws.

02:16:13.907 --> 02:16:15.803
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

02:16:15.803 --> 02:16:21.965
LIAM: (growling) That is a failure.

02:16:21.965 --> 02:16:25.152
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that's a failure. Wow!

02:16:25.152 --> 02:16:30.145
MARISHA: You get a little more frustrated. You
move a point from criminal to bear as you don't

02:16:30.145 --> 02:16:37.517
have the opposable thumbs to dexterously enough--

02:16:37.517 --> 02:16:40.788
LIAM: I got a fucking splinter! Oh jeez.

02:16:40.788 --> 02:16:42.769
TALIESIN: That's what you get for trying to lift
things like you've got thumbs.

02:16:42.769 --> 02:16:52.311
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and, seeing as how a
dexterous attempt doesn't seem to be working I'm

02:16:52.311 --> 02:16:56.504
going to slam by bear self into it repeatedly to
try and get it to tip over.

02:16:56.504 --> 02:16:58.479
MARISHA: Roll for bear.

02:16:58.479 --> 02:17:02.126
BRIAN: I'm going to go over to Cookie and suck the
stapler out of his paw.

02:17:02.126 --> 02:17:03.540
MATT: Success!

02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:05.032
LIAM: The splinter?

02:17:05.032 --> 02:17:06.632
BRIAN: The splinter out of his paw while--

02:17:06.632 --> 02:17:13.723
MARISHA: You successfully are a maternal bear. You
mama bear suck the splinter--

02:17:13.723 --> 02:17:16.040
LIAM: This is bringing up feelings in me.

02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.114
MARISHA: You find a case of the shiny rollies.

02:17:19.114 --> 02:17:21.204
ALL: Ooh!

02:17:21.204 --> 02:17:22.594
MATT: Good to know.

02:17:22.594 --> 02:17:25.149
SAM: We should keep those together probably,
right?

02:17:25.149 --> 02:17:26.681
MATT: Yeah, I think so. Just in case.

02:17:26.681 --> 02:17:29.716
MARISHA: So you have a couple more.

02:17:29.716 --> 02:17:32.266
SAM: There's something about you and that pistol.

02:17:32.266 --> 02:17:33.830
TALIESIN: It's like I was born for it.

02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:35.801
LIAM: It feels right

02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:37.261
BRIAN: It feels very natural.

02:17:37.517 --> 02:17:39.099
LIAM: That's just right.

02:17:39.099 --> 02:17:41.979
MARISHA: (whispers) That's just right.

02:17:41.979 --> 02:17:43.584
BRIAN: That motion; very natural for you.

02:17:43.584 --> 02:17:46.694
MARISHA: There are like two more crates left that
you guys haven't messed up with.

02:17:46.694 --> 02:17:50.165
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and smash one more now
that I've got--

02:17:50.165 --> 02:17:51.816
BRIAN: I could try another one.

02:17:51.816 --> 02:17:53.729
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a ramming run at one
of them.

02:17:53.729 --> 02:17:57.870
MARISHA: Okay. You take one, you take the other.
You have advantage. You roll for bear.

02:17:57.870 --> 02:17:59.756
MATT: I'm going to eat some honey.

02:17:59.756 --> 02:18:01.046
BRIAN and TALIESIN: That's a failure.

02:18:01.046 --> 02:18:09.030
MARISHA: Oof. Man, you get a little bit more
frustrated, each of you. Feel free to--

02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:12.536
SAM: Should we abandon crate? Should we keep
going?

02:18:12.536 --> 02:18:13.783
LIAM: Got to get in.

02:18:13.783 --> 02:18:15.745
SAM: I can give it one more shot if we want.

02:18:15.745 --> 02:18:17.783
MARISHA: Do you want to sit on one more?

02:18:17.783 --> 02:18:19.120
SAM: I'll sit on one more.

02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.417
MATT: Pushing it. Give it a shot

02:18:20.417 --> 02:18:22.374
SAM: Success.

02:18:22.374 --> 02:18:31.812
MARISHA: Okay. You open it and there's one of
these shiny rolly balls. In its own separate case

02:18:31.812 --> 02:18:37.505
and it's got a stamp on the side and a little bit
of this magical aura to it.

02:18:37.505 --> 02:18:38.946
SAM: Written in bear?

02:18:38.946 --> 02:18:40.771
LIAM: Magical aura?

02:18:40.771 --> 02:18:42.921
BRIAN: One of these balls is not like the other
one.

02:18:42.921 --> 02:18:48.367
LIAM: Magical aura? What are you looking at
Peddy?

02:18:48.367 --> 02:18:50.629
BRIAN: What do you got?

02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:57.397
SAM: It says "Salmon, salmon, bamboo, bamboo,
salmon, salmon, bamboo." It's going to take me

02:18:57.397 --> 02:19:03.985
a while to decipher. It's written in sema-bear.

02:19:03.985 --> 02:19:10.607
LIAM: Oh it's covered in glyphs.

02:19:10.607 --> 02:19:13.119
SAM: It says something about--

02:19:13.119 --> 02:19:15.306
TALIESIN: Pronounced salmon and bamboo.

02:19:15.306 --> 02:19:21.449
SAM: It seems to be a thing that we can use to
magically summon someone to help us.

02:19:21.681 --> 02:19:23.564
So only if we get in dire straits.

02:19:23.564 --> 02:19:28.661
MARISHA: Wait, I did the exact same thing that I
did to you last time. I gave you the wrong one!

02:19:28.661 --> 02:19:30.973
LIAM: Rewind. Rewind.

02:19:30.973 --> 02:19:34.501
SAM: This makes far more sense.

02:19:34.501 --> 02:19:36.920
LIAM: Oh, it's a fish.

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:40.423
SAM: Okay. It's just a really more powerful one of
these.

02:19:40.423 --> 02:19:43.964
(laughter)

02:19:43.964 --> 02:19:45.509
MATT: You were reading it the wrong direction.

02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:49.503
SAM: Yeah. It was salmon, salmon, salmon, salmon,
bamboo, salmon, bamboo.

NOTE Paragraph

02:19:49.503 --> 02:19:52.911
LIAM: Right. Because it's the Acuda, right? It's
the left, right, right, left thing again. Yep, yep.

02:19:52.911 --> 02:19:54.450
MATT: Gets me every time.

02:19:54.450 --> 02:19:57.911
TALIESIN: I'm feeling really frustrated, I just want
to run headlong into one more of these crates

02:19:58.123 --> 02:19:59.184
to see if I can get anything else going.

02:19:59.184 --> 02:20:00.254
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

02:20:00.254 --> 02:20:02.352
TALIESIN: Finally, a success.

02:20:02.352 --> 02:20:04.611
MARISHA: Okay, I was going to say, because you're
pretty frustrated.

02:20:04.611 --> 02:20:06.650
TALIESIN: I was getting pretty frustrated there.

02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:08.302
MATT: If you had failed that, you would've lost
it.

02:20:08.302 --> 02:20:09.332
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:20:09.332 --> 02:20:21.976
MARISHA: You crack it open and you find the
remaining bullets. I mean, roly balls. Kody Yak

02:20:21.976 --> 02:20:30.225
goes, "You got to be careful, you know. He's got a
lot of people hiding around here. He's got us all

02:20:30.494 --> 02:20:33.440
"at his fingertips. He can destroy anything."

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:43.839
MATT: I've survived every battle I've ever been in.
No one can take me down. Trust me, we'll be fine.

02:20:44.103 --> 02:20:47.534
MARISHA: "You seem deeply convincing. Look like a
bear that's seen a lot."

02:20:47.534 --> 02:20:52.049
BRIAN: Don't worry. If shit gets really bad, this
guy's going in a necklace.

02:20:52.049 --> 02:20:58.455
LIAM: She's within a thousand feet of you right
now, yeah?

02:20:58.455 --> 02:21:00.456
MATT: I don't know what that means.

02:21:00.456 --> 02:21:02.041
LIAM: Good, we're set.

02:21:02.041 --> 02:21:05.755
MATT: Come on, let's go!

02:21:05.755 --> 02:21:09.321
MARISHA: You guys lead the way--

02:21:09.321 --> 02:21:10.545
BRIAN: Is Kody coming with us?

02:21:10.545 --> 02:21:17.927
MARISHA: Kody is coming. He's a little shaken and
disturbed-looking, but he goes down and follows

02:21:17.927 --> 02:21:27.508
you guys. As you guys approach the inconspicuous
door, it's a stark opposite from what you guys

02:21:27.508 --> 02:21:33.377
just experienced at Vinnie the Pooh's. A little
hidden, a little inconspicuous. It looks like any

02:21:33.377 --> 02:21:37.079
other of the Fort Lox doors in front of it.

02:21:37.079 --> 02:21:42.008
TALIESIN: I feel like this door is doing a lot of
work to try and not be noticed here. It's strange.

02:21:42.008 --> 02:21:49.945
MARISHA: The Brains has a point. This appears to be,
according to the directions, Hattori Bongo's room.

02:21:49.945 --> 02:21:57.702
MATT: Can I take a look at that and pull out some
of my more delicate and quiet silverware, and see

02:21:57.702 --> 02:22:00.556
if I can find a way to break through the lock
without being noticed?

02:22:00.556 --> 02:22:04.590
MARISHA: You can. Roll with advantage for
criminal.

02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:07.389
MATT: That's a success with a four.

02:22:07.389 --> 02:22:08.633
MARISHA: Okay.

02:22:08.633 --> 02:22:11.869
SAM: He's getting up there in criminal.

02:22:11.869 --> 02:22:16.549
MATT: Starting to get them wily ideas about a
crazy future.

02:22:16.549 --> 02:22:23.591
MARISHA: You pull out your corn cob-shaped
skewers, the thinnest ones that you could find.

02:22:23.591 --> 02:22:37.744
You go in there-- ting! Don't-- calm, you focus.
After you felt one little pin go, and-- (clicking).

02:22:37.744 --> 02:22:39.287
MATT: (whines)

02:22:39.287 --> 02:22:44.122
MARISHA: You're going to have to crank the turn
wheel.

02:22:44.122 --> 02:22:52.270
MATT: (cranking, click) We ready for this?

02:22:52.270 --> 02:22:56.628
BRIAN: I'm going to be right in the corner of where
the door's going to open, ready to pounce if I need to.

02:22:56.628 --> 02:23:00.129
SAM: I've got the motorcycle parked just outside
so we can make a quick getaway.

02:23:00.129 --> 02:23:04.552
MATT: Hey, Waffle. You got them fireworks ready?

02:23:04.552 --> 02:23:06.761
TALIESIN: I was just about to bring them out.

02:23:06.761 --> 02:23:11.739
MATT: When shit goes belly-up, you throw them in.
I'll follow suit. Trust me.

02:23:11.739 --> 02:23:13.511
BRIAN: Yeah, cause a diversion.

02:23:13.511 --> 02:23:15.580
LIAM: I'm downing my extra cocktail.

02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:22.233
MATT: If it gets real bad and anyone's hurting, we'll
all sidle up and form a bear-rier, to protect them.

02:23:22.233 --> 02:23:24.203
SAM: A bear-ricade.

02:23:24.203 --> 02:23:27.243
MATT: A bear-ricade. All right.

02:23:27.243 --> 02:23:34.490
MARISHA: I will count that as a-- if anyone wants
to a do a flashback planning, you can, and move.

02:23:34.490 --> 02:23:39.633
If anyone wants to down any honey, you can move
one point voluntarily at this time.

02:23:39.633 --> 02:23:42.057
MATT: I'm going to have my last jar of honey in
preparation.

02:23:42.057 --> 02:23:43.384
BRIAN: From criminal to bear?

02:23:43.384 --> 02:23:51.701
MARISHA: Or bear to criminal, if you want to down
honey. Or yeah, you know what I mean. If you want

02:23:51.701 --> 02:23:53.249
to move a point, you can. Yeah.

02:23:53.249 --> 02:23:55.450
BRIAN: Is it a flashback?

02:23:55.450 --> 02:23:59.788
MARISHA: I'm considering his little pre-planning
just now a flashback.

02:23:59.788 --> 02:24:08.923
BRIAN: Remember the last time we smashed something
and a bunch of balls came out? Yeah. I don't know.

02:24:08.923 --> 02:24:11.863
MATT: Hold onto that memory.

02:24:11.863 --> 02:24:13.400
BRIAN: Yeah, I do. Every night.

02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:14.930
TALIESIN: You want the gun, or you want the
fireworks?

02:24:14.930 --> 02:24:16.600
MARISHA: The gun in the first act?

02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:19.991
LIAM: I think you're better suited for the gun,
for some reason.

02:24:19.991 --> 02:24:23.323
TALIESIN: You take the box of fireworks.

02:24:23.323 --> 02:24:25.714
LIAM: Do I need that shiny stuff to set these
things off?

02:24:25.714 --> 02:24:29.258
TALIESIN: No, you just throw it in there. It'll be
fine.

02:24:29.258 --> 02:24:31.420
LIAM: All right, I've got a good throwing arm.
Let's do this.

02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:34.188
MATT: All right. Ready?

02:24:34.188 --> 02:24:38.608
SAM: Oh yeah. I was bear-n ready. Nope.

02:24:38.608 --> 02:24:41.946
MATT: All right.

02:24:41.946 --> 02:24:43.581
LIAM: We do it for the honey.

02:24:43.581 --> 02:24:50.207
MATT: We do it for the honey. Paws in. Three, two,
one--

02:24:50.207 --> 02:24:51.386
SAM: Go vegan!

02:24:51.386 --> 02:24:52.810
BRIAN: Mazel-paws.

02:24:52.810 --> 02:24:55.467
MATT: (boom) I push the door open!

02:24:55.467 --> 02:25:02.811
MARISHA: It's a heavy iron door but with your
terrifying rage, you immediately slam it open. You

02:25:02.811 --> 02:25:09.075
see it's a small room, but there's a big window.
Which is odd, because you haven't seen a lot of

02:25:09.075 --> 02:25:14.000
windows. It seems to be a mysterious misplaced
window. In front of it, in a long cloak,

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:23.659
slicked-back hair, he turns around. Big black
bear, white around his mouth, big brown eyes that

02:25:23.659 --> 02:25:27.329
looks at you, "Oh hello, Trinket."

02:25:27.329 --> 02:25:28.789
MATT: (puzzled grunt)

02:25:28.789 --> 02:25:39.269
MARISHA: "I've been watching all of you. Sweet
Brothers, right? Welcome! I'm assuming you guys

02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:41.500
"are here trying to overthrow me, right?"

02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:44.336
LIAM: That's kind of the idea, yeah.

02:25:44.336 --> 02:25:45.375
TALIESIN: That's the plan.

02:25:45.375 --> 02:25:47.113
SAM: It's going down, Bongo!

02:25:47.113 --> 02:25:54.608
MARISHA: "Hmm, We'll see about that. I just want
to say, you need to think about anything that you

02:25:54.608 --> 02:26:02.119
"want to do from here on out. Because I have this."
He pulls out a little tiny vial with a little fleck

02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:08.445
of crystallized sugar that has congealed in the
bottom left-hand corner of the bottle.

02:26:08.445 --> 02:26:10.264
BRIAN: You can't threaten us with meth!

02:26:10.264 --> 02:26:15.265
SAM: What is that, though? For real?

02:26:15.265 --> 02:26:21.625
(laughter)

02:26:21.625 --> 02:26:25.759
BRIAN: I have immunity towards amphetamines!

02:26:26.001 --> 02:26:35.136
MARISHA: "We know all of your weaknesses. All of
them. Now, that's not what we're after.

02:26:35.136 --> 02:26:38.988
"This here, this is Balootonium."

02:26:38.988 --> 02:26:41.958
SAM: What's it do?

02:26:41.958 --> 02:26:43.945
MARISHA: "Oh, come on!"

02:26:43.945 --> 02:26:45.390
LIAM: I mean, we're bears.

02:26:45.390 --> 02:26:48.903
MATT: Is it sweet? Is it tasty?

02:26:49.097 --> 02:26:50.370
BRIAN: Yeah!

02:26:50.370 --> 02:26:56.344
MARISHA: "You all think that the Harvest Fest was
just about controlling the honey trade, is that right?"

02:26:56.344 --> 02:26:57.414
MATT: Yeah.

02:26:57.414 --> 02:26:58.653
BRIAN: Yeah.

02:26:58.653 --> 02:27:00.182
LIAM: It's the greatest thing in life!

02:27:00.182 --> 02:27:02.910
SAM: That's exactly how it was presented to us.

02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:10.761
MARISHA: "You fools! We were after that crazed
man. The little bald one with three fingers! He's

02:27:10.761 --> 02:27:20.561
"the secret. We've managed to cultivate this
Balootonium: a highly-concentrated

02:27:20.561 --> 02:27:24.455
"explosive of pure nitro-honey."

02:27:24.455 --> 02:27:27.650
SAM: What are you going to blow up?

02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:30.483
MARISHA: "All of Westruun, if I have to."

02:27:30.689 --> 02:27:33.429
LIAM: (stuttering) But can you still eat it?

02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:41.227
MARISHA: "Yeah. It's actually quite densely sweet.
So sweet, just the touch of other molecules aside

02:27:41.227 --> 02:27:44.260
"from its own will make you explode and blow your
head into a million pieces."

02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:47.413
MATT: How much will that piece blow up?

02:27:47.413 --> 02:27:53.947
MARISHA: "Well, this right here can demolish all
of this fort if I wanted to."

02:27:53.947 --> 02:27:59.240
BRIAN: Eat it! Eat it!

02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:00.414
TALIESIN: We dare you.

02:28:00.414 --> 02:28:01.783
SAM: No, then we'll blow up inside.

02:28:01.783 --> 02:28:03.570
MARISHA: "You will definitely die."

02:28:03.570 --> 02:28:07.021
BRIAN: We don't know how long it takes for him to
digest something like that.

02:28:07.021 --> 02:28:13.787
MARISHA: "No-- any introduction of outside atoms,
like water, will cause a quick chemical reaction

02:28:13.787 --> 02:28:17.641
"and you all explode very quickly! I've thought of
of all about this!"

02:28:17.641 --> 02:28:21.275
TALIESIN: Do you have a whiteboard that you can
show to explain all about this?

02:28:21.275 --> 02:28:27.116
MARISHA: "I have plans! Don't try to brain-drain
me! You're not going to get my plans!"

02:28:27.116 --> 02:28:28.563
LIAM: (whispering) What is an atom?

02:28:28.563 --> 02:28:32.541
MARISHA: "I'm just saying, If I drop this, you all
explode!"

02:28:32.541 --> 02:28:33.777
SAM: Okay!

02:28:33.777 --> 02:28:35.831
BRIAN: Stop waving it around so much!

02:28:35.831 --> 02:28:37.350
MATT: Is it the color blue?

02:28:37.350 --> 02:28:40.958
MARISHA: No, it's (emphasis) Baloo. Baloo-nium.

02:28:40.958 --> 02:28:42.548
MATT: Oh! It's not even blue.

02:28:42.548 --> 02:28:46.171
MARISHA: There are a lot of deep-layered puns in
this entire game.

02:28:46.171 --> 02:28:51.336
BRIAN: Okay. What do you guys think?

02:28:51.336 --> 02:28:55.582
SAM: Well, what's our choice? What are you asking
us to do? Just leave?

02:28:55.582 --> 02:29:02.126
MARISHA: "No. I'm asking you to fight!" And at
that time--

02:29:02.126 --> 02:29:03.623
BRIAN: Fuck me!

02:29:03.623 --> 02:29:10.569
SAM: There's a map! Guys, we need to be using this
time to come up with more puns. There's Smokey,

02:29:10.569 --> 02:29:12.121
there's Yogi, come on, guys!

02:29:12.121 --> 02:29:15.667
MARISHA: Hattori Bongo--

02:29:15.667 --> 02:29:17.364
MATT: Oh my god! What?!

02:29:17.364 --> 02:29:18.656
LIAM: Whoa!

02:29:18.656 --> 02:29:20.231
MARISHA: --exposes himself.

02:29:20.231 --> 02:29:22.072
TALIESIN: Did put a--? You did.

02:29:22.072 --> 02:29:23.378
MARISHA: Yeah, I've put a ninja mask--

02:29:23.378 --> 02:29:25.163
TALIESIN: You put a ninja mask on a bear.

02:29:25.163 --> 02:29:31.002
LIAM: Sidenote: Matt and I just learned the other
day that, seven days without a pun makes one week.

02:29:31.112 --> 02:29:34.398
(groaning)

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:37.128
SAM: Wait a second. You're gonna have to shoot
balls in his mouth.

02:29:37.128 --> 02:29:39.318
TALIESIN: Yeah. This is not my first rodeo.

02:29:39.318 --> 02:29:43.202
(laughter)

02:29:43.202 --> 02:29:45.457
MATT: We knew you were fit for the task,
Taliesin!

02:29:45.457 --> 02:29:54.155
MARISHA: As he drops down, two of his lackeys drop
down in front of him. Here's a ninja bear.

02:29:54.155 --> 02:29:56.674
SAM: Oh, you're going to block it?!

02:29:56.674 --> 02:29:59.959
(laughter)

02:29:59.959 --> 02:30:01.227
MATT: That's amazing!

02:30:01.227 --> 02:30:02.674
MARISHA: Missed.

02:30:02.674 --> 02:30:07.322
BRIAN: You have to push one to the front. You have
to get it just to the tip there, yeah.

02:30:07.322 --> 02:30:14.027
MARISHA: With that first pop, kakoof! Did you hit
him? No? It went wide?

02:30:14.027 --> 02:30:16.444
TALIESIN: It was an accidental misfire.

02:30:16.444 --> 02:30:19.081
BRIAN: It was a premature misfire.

02:30:19.081 --> 02:30:21.362
MARISHA: I'll give you that, I'll give you one.

02:30:21.362 --> 02:30:23.883
BRIAN: You get one of your balls back.

02:30:23.883 --> 02:30:25.179
MARISHA: You get a ball back.

02:30:25.179 --> 02:30:28.944
TALIESIN: That's not a thing that happens outside
of games. There we go.

02:30:28.944 --> 02:30:36.366
MARISHA: With that first explosive round, and then
that second explosive round as you fire two rapid

02:30:36.366 --> 02:30:45.323
shots, pow pow, from your rifle, Kody Yak has
blood vessels pop in his eyes. He enrages as that

02:30:45.323 --> 02:30:53.471
seems to be the cue, and he turns against you.
Kody Yak is now a ninja bear! What are you going

02:30:53.471 --> 02:30:58.544
to do about it? What are you going to do-- oh my
god!

02:30:58.631 --> 02:31:02.141
SAM: You shot Marisha!

02:31:02.141 --> 02:31:04.001
TALIESIN: She was threatening me! Ah!

02:31:04.483 --> 02:31:07.125
BRIAN: Higher!

02:31:07.125 --> 02:31:09.736
SAM: How many does he have to get in?

02:31:09.736 --> 02:31:10.938
MATT: Hold on!

02:31:10.938 --> 02:31:11.970
BRIAN: Wait, wait!

02:31:11.970 --> 02:31:13.359
MARISHA: I'm only counting hits.

02:31:13.359 --> 02:31:14.697
SAM: Oh wait, those are hits?

02:31:14.697 --> 02:31:16.571
MARISHA: So you've hit him twice?

02:31:16.690 --> 02:31:17.729
TALIESIN: I think I've hit him twice.

02:31:17.729 --> 02:31:20.266
BRIAN: Yeah, you've hit him twice, but don't we
have to get it inside of his mouth?

02:31:20.266 --> 02:31:22.641
MARISHA: No, I'm now solely counting hits.

02:31:22.641 --> 02:31:28.384
MATT: As the second hit hits, and they're all
guarding, I'm going to try and use Trinket's thief

02:31:28.384 --> 02:31:35.071
skills to ninja roll between his defenders and see
if I can grab the Balootonium from his grasp.

02:31:35.071 --> 02:31:39.270
MARISHA: Okay. Roll with advantage under
criminal.

02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:41.387
MATT: Success!

02:31:41.387 --> 02:31:46.495
BRIAN: Can I try and somersault and trip Kody
while he's going back and forth?

02:31:47.010 --> 02:31:55.138
MARISHA: You can. Roll for criminal, I think.
Success. As he is distracted, he's like, "Ha! Aw."

02:31:55.138 --> 02:31:56.778
BRIAN: Success!

02:31:56.778 --> 02:32:02.217
MARISHA: With that, Kody Yak trips. He is down
temporarily, on the floor floundering.

02:32:02.217 --> 02:32:03.595
LIAM: The ninjas are still up?

02:32:03.595 --> 02:32:04.862
MARISHA: The ninjas are still up, though.

02:32:04.862 --> 02:32:09.347
LIAM: All right, Cookie remembers his training
with Yogi Berra, and throws the the fireworks at

02:32:09.347 --> 02:32:11.002
the two ninjas!

02:32:11.002 --> 02:32:13.079
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

02:32:13.079 --> 02:32:16.838
LIAM: That is a big failure.

02:32:16.838 --> 02:32:21.201
MARISHA: They go wide, they pop in the corner.
These are ninjas, they're used to explosives.

02:32:21.201 --> 02:32:24.401
BRIAN: Can I grab them from the corner and try and
throw them?

02:32:24.401 --> 02:32:27.151
MARISHA: They've already been expended. The ones
that he has.

02:32:27.151 --> 02:32:28.396
MATT: It's okay, don't worry.

02:32:28.396 --> 02:32:29.636
LIAM: Shoot it in his mouth, Waffle!

02:32:29.636 --> 02:32:32.146
(cheering)

02:32:32.146 --> 02:32:34.452
MARISHA: One more.

02:32:34.452 --> 02:32:37.809
BRIAN: Get both of the balls in his mouth, quick!

02:32:37.809 --> 02:32:42.546
LIAM: Shove them in! Shoot it in his mouth!

02:32:42.546 --> 02:32:45.891
MARISHA: Oh! He is still up!

02:32:46.307 --> 02:32:47.371
MATT: That's all right!

02:32:47.371 --> 02:32:55.120
SAM: Wait, I got one more bullet. Should I try it?
It says it has the power of ten bullets, but it

02:32:55.120 --> 02:32:58.478
will destroy the gun.

02:32:58.478 --> 02:32:59.935
TALIESIN: I believe in you!

02:32:59.935 --> 02:33:01.272
MATT: We believe in you!

02:33:01.272 --> 02:33:02.833
TALIESIN: This is what you were born for.

02:33:02.833 --> 02:33:07.574
BRIAN: You're at a bad angle for ball insertion.

02:33:07.574 --> 02:33:09.259
SAM: Do I have to get it in the mouth, or just hit
it?

02:33:09.259 --> 02:33:10.208
MARISHA: You just have to hit him.

02:33:10.208 --> 02:33:19.502
SAM: Oh. I flashback to when I was a child in
Szechuan, China.

02:33:19.502 --> 02:33:21.213
MARISHA: Hang on.

02:33:21.213 --> 02:33:25.462
LIAM: Or whatever the Exandria equivalent is.

02:33:25.684 --> 02:33:30.057
MATT: In the Shattered Teeth, far south of the
continent of Wildemount.

02:33:30.057 --> 02:33:36.948
SAM: My father said to me, "Run, Peddy, run. The
hunters have come." I heard in the distance firing

02:33:36.948 --> 02:33:43.925
sounds, because the Chinese invented guns long
before anyone else did. I heard gunfire and I ran

02:33:43.925 --> 02:33:49.937
and ran, and that's the last time I saw my family,
and that was the last time I ever saw a gun. Now,

02:33:49.937 --> 02:33:52.926
it will be my salvation.

02:33:52.926 --> 02:33:58.059
MARISHA: The strange flashback music playing, you
steady your focus. You think about--

02:33:58.059 --> 02:34:02.657
(loud cheering)

02:34:02.657 --> 02:34:08.457
(laughter)

02:34:08.457 --> 02:34:16.710
MARISHA: With that, an explosive orb of magical
energy expands around the bullet. It looks like a

02:34:16.890 --> 02:34:20.217
comet as it races straight towards Hattori Bongo.

02:34:20.217 --> 02:34:21.612
BRIAN: Wait! Oh, sorry.

02:34:21.612 --> 02:34:27.361
MARISHA: It hits him, and upon impact you see the
blue cascading energy course around him. It

02:34:27.361 --> 02:34:38.990
crackles inwards and he explodes into a thousand
pieces with the energy of the ten-plus powerful bullets.

02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:41.370
BRIAN: Can I try to grab the thing before it hits
the ground?

02:34:41.370 --> 02:34:46.745
MATT: I already grabbed it. However, there are
still two ninjas. I'm like: Guys, run!

02:34:46.745 --> 02:34:48.563
I've got this, trust me!

02:34:48.563 --> 02:34:49.965
SAM: You're going to stay?

02:34:49.965 --> 02:34:55.917
MATT: I pull out the potion I had found earlier,
and I go: Who's ready for some celebratory

02:34:55.917 --> 02:34:59.461
fireworks? I throw it to the back corner of the
room, near the ninjas.

02:34:59.461 --> 02:35:00.608
MARISHA: Okay.

02:35:00.608 --> 02:35:04.771
MATT: It's a potion of Fireball, that reads: I've
run out of passions--

02:35:04.771 --> 02:35:06.566
SAM: Potions.

02:35:06.566 --> 02:35:08.603
MATT: No, it says passions.

02:35:08.603 --> 02:35:13.818
MARISHA: It was from a list of "passions" and he
just ran out of "passions" and made a potion.

02:35:13.818 --> 02:35:19.165
MATT: Roll to cast. Produce a fireball that
inflicts d6 damage per caster level to all

02:35:19.165 --> 02:35:21.827
creatures in a 20-foot radius. Reflex save for
half damage.

02:35:21.827 --> 02:35:22.995
SAM: What?!

02:35:22.995 --> 02:35:24.441
MATT: He just went straight to D&D rolls for this
one.

02:35:24.441 --> 02:35:25.901
MARISHA: He just stole a D&D fireball.

02:35:25.901 --> 02:35:26.957
BRIAN: That's amazing.

02:35:26.957 --> 02:35:31.543
MATT: So I'm holding the Balootonium in one hand
and this potion in the other and I go (slow-mo

02:35:31.543 --> 02:35:40.319
voice) Run! (whooshing) We all just turn and start
running as it flies towards the fireworks. Do I

02:35:40.319 --> 02:35:46.100
have to roll anything? d6 per caster level. How
many caster levels does a bear have?

02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:49.138
MARISHA: Roll this under your criminal thief stat
with advantage.

02:35:49.138 --> 02:35:56.796
MATT: All right. Oh no. That's a success. It also
put me at full thief.

02:35:56.796 --> 02:35:58.784
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:35:58.784 --> 02:36:02.049
LIAM: The bear is ours.

02:36:02.049 --> 02:36:03.817
MARISHA: It crashes.

02:36:03.817 --> 02:36:06.799
MATT: How many caster levels is the potion?

02:36:06.799 --> 02:36:09.310
MARISHA: It kills them instantly.

02:36:09.310 --> 02:36:12.023
MATT: I want to roll dice!

02:36:12.123 --> 02:36:16.371
MARISHA: Well, you're full criminal so I'm going
to say roll four dice.

02:36:16.371 --> 02:36:21.076
MATT: That is 14 points of fireball damage.

02:36:21.076 --> 02:36:28.847
MARISHA: 14 points is plenty. It singes their
hair. These are like three hit point bears. There

02:36:28.847 --> 02:36:31.599
are no points! He had three hits.

02:36:31.599 --> 02:36:32.890
LIAM: Ten million space bucks!

02:36:32.890 --> 02:36:36.232
MATT: As I'm running down the hallway--

02:36:36.232 --> 02:36:42.375
MARISHA: (explosions) You see flames lick out of the
front door of the corridor, you guys run down further.

02:36:42.375 --> 02:36:44.027
SAM: Get on the bike, guys!

02:36:44.027 --> 02:36:46.279
MATT: Are the fireworks going off?

02:36:46.279 --> 02:36:50.509
MARISHA: The left over gunpowder, you hear
(popping) like someone threw--

02:36:50.509 --> 02:36:52.275
LIAM: Jump on the panda bike!

02:36:52.275 --> 02:36:54.045
SAM: Jump on the bike! Let her rip!

02:36:54.045 --> 02:37:00.662
(motorcycle imitations)

02:37:00.662 --> 02:37:02.152
MARISHA: You turn down the left corridor!

02:37:02.152 --> 02:37:05.246
(motorcycle imitations)

02:37:05.246 --> 02:37:07.112
MARISHA: You scrape the wall a little bit as you
turn down the right!

02:37:07.112 --> 02:37:09.964
SAM: Do I need to roll to escape the fire?

02:37:09.964 --> 02:37:14.966
MARISHA: You're the driver, you're guiding, so I'd
say you feel the heat coming behind you. Trinket,

02:37:14.966 --> 02:37:16.867
you've got the nitro-honey in your hand--

02:37:16.867 --> 02:37:18.336
SAM: I failed!

02:37:18.336 --> 02:37:25.391
MARISHA: Oh no! You hear a little bit of popping
and shrapnel coming up from behind you and a piece

02:37:25.391 --> 02:37:28.317
of crate gets caught in the spoke wheels of the
bike.

02:37:28.317 --> 02:37:31.378
(shouting)

02:37:31.378 --> 02:37:33.526
LIAM: I can't bear it!

02:37:33.526 --> 02:37:41.085
MATT: I barely cradle the Balootonium, taking the
brunt of it with my body.

02:37:41.085 --> 02:37:45.110
MARISHA: Roll for-- you're going to have to roll
for criminal.

02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:48.483
MATT: I auto-success.

02:37:48.483 --> 02:37:49.807
MARISHA: You auto-success, that's right.

02:37:49.807 --> 02:37:56.236
MATT: I stand up and looking at these four guys,
the wily glare in my face of one who has

02:37:56.236 --> 02:38:05.705
completely turned to the side of crime and
lawlessness goes: I'm sorry friends, but I've got

02:38:05.705 --> 02:38:07.661
my own plans. And I go running the other way.

02:38:07.661 --> 02:38:10.338
SAM: What happened to Trinket?!

02:38:10.338 --> 02:38:11.633
MARISHA: You chase after him, okay!

02:38:11.633 --> 02:38:13.116
BRIAN: We go with him, we go chasing after him.

02:38:13.116 --> 02:38:14.550
SAM: We're going back into the tunnel?

02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:19.760
MARISHA: You guys had made it through that fork in
the road where that main-- you came down that

02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:24.338
right corridor, and there's that main stretch of
corridor towards the exit. So that means Trinket,

02:38:24.625 --> 02:38:28.591
you go up the right way, up the fork in the
corridor you guys had not been down.

02:38:28.591 --> 02:38:30.134
MATT: I'm running, staring at it.

02:38:30.134 --> 02:38:31.178
SAM: We've got to get him, guys.

02:38:31.178 --> 02:38:32.747
LIAM: Tuxpin, get me close to that bear!

02:38:32.747 --> 02:38:34.888
SAM: I don't have a vehicle, jump on my back!

02:38:34.888 --> 02:38:37.371
BRIAN: Is there any honey on the walls?

02:38:37.371 --> 02:38:38.777
MARISHA: There is <i>so</i> much honey.

02:38:38.777 --> 02:38:41.614
BRIAN: I'm just scooping a ton into my paw.

02:38:41.614 --> 02:38:45.853
MATT: I'm just laughing wildly as I'm looking at
it. So much power! (evil laugh)

02:38:45.853 --> 02:38:46.988
BRIAN: Can we catch up to him?

02:38:46.988 --> 02:38:49.850
MARISHA: You can. I would say all of you make
rolls.

02:38:49.850 --> 02:38:52.170
SAM: Do I get advantage because I'm a driver?

02:38:52.170 --> 02:38:53.697
MARISHA: Yes, you get advantage.

02:38:53.697 --> 02:38:54.883
LIAM: At what?

02:38:54.883 --> 02:38:59.605
MARISHA: Just roll for bear as you're running
after him.

02:38:59.605 --> 02:39:00.509
TALIESIN: I succeed.

02:39:00.509 --> 02:39:01.598
LIAM, BRIAN, and SAM: Success!

02:39:01.598 --> 02:39:03.764
BRIAN: Do we catch up to him?

02:39:03.764 --> 02:39:05.546
MARISHA: You catch up to him.

02:39:05.546 --> 02:39:09.678
BRIAN: I shove all of the honey I grabbed off the
wall into his mouth and I'm just leached onto his

02:39:09.678 --> 02:39:12.539
neck and I'm just shoving all of the honey into
his mouth.

02:39:12.539 --> 02:39:13.960
SAM: Use your strength, Las Vegas!

02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:17.228
LIAM: I'm the little bear and I'm boxing him in
the nuts as hard as I can!

02:39:17.228 --> 02:39:22.448
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the Balootonium and
stash it.

02:39:22.448 --> 02:39:30.559
MARISHA: Okay, <i>you</i> roll for criminal, <i>you</i>
roll-- you auto-succeed on everything. No,

02:39:30.559 --> 02:39:36.586
you're good, you're good. I would say you roll for
bear-- muscle with advantage to see if you get in.

02:39:36.586 --> 02:39:40.122
MATT: See if you can force me to swallow it.

02:39:40.122 --> 02:39:41.988
BRIAN: Success. Double success.

02:39:41.988 --> 02:39:44.280
TALIESIN: I got it. Success.

02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:46.191
BRIAN: I'm really good at forcing people to
swallow things.

02:39:46.191 --> 02:39:48.650
MARISHA: You are successfully
honey-waterboarding.

02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:51.320
BRIAN: You've been honey-boarded, my friend.

02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:53.756
TALIESIN: I stash it with my--

02:39:53.756 --> 02:39:55.421
MATT: (laughing) Honey-boarded!

02:39:55.421 --> 02:39:57.998
LIAM: I have not stopped mauling his balls!

02:39:57.998 --> 02:40:04.524
MARISHA: As you wake up, you see Cookie at your
testicles doing a little speed boxing routine.

02:40:04.524 --> 02:40:08.724
LIAM: Come to your senses, Trinket! Come back to
us!

02:40:08.724 --> 02:40:10.988
MATT: I'm all right! Oh god!

02:40:10.988 --> 02:40:12.859
LIAM: I got to make sure!

02:40:12.859 --> 02:40:17.196
BRIAN: He's fine. I shoved a bunch of sticky stuff
in his mouth and he's good now.

02:40:17.196 --> 02:40:21.101
LIAM: Okay. Maybe just a little bit more! Okay.

02:40:21.101 --> 02:40:24.902
BRIAN: What happened? Are you all right?

02:40:24.902 --> 02:40:26.663
MATT: I'm okay.

02:40:26.663 --> 02:40:29.102
BRIAN: It's okay, we've got the Balootonium.

02:40:29.102 --> 02:40:32.306
TALIESIN and LIAM: Scraping the honey off the
walls.

02:40:32.306 --> 02:40:39.350
MARISHA: As Liam Las Vegas says that, Trinket, you
realize you do not have the Balootonium.

02:40:39.350 --> 02:40:41.067
MATT: Oh my god! Where did it go?

02:40:41.134 --> 02:40:45.686
BRIAN: We've got it. It's okay. Waffle's got it.
He's fine.

02:40:45.686 --> 02:40:46.707
TALIESIN: I got it.

02:40:46.707 --> 02:40:49.768
BRIAN: It's safe. We gave it to The Brains.

02:40:49.768 --> 02:40:53.762
SAM: Guys? Let's get the hell out of here.

02:40:53.762 --> 02:40:55.241
BRIAN: We got to get the honey!

02:40:55.241 --> 02:40:56.514
SAM: What do you mean? What honey?

02:40:56.514 --> 02:40:57.859
MATT: The honey's here.

02:40:57.859 --> 02:40:59.641
BRIAN: The honey's here, we got to grab as much of
it as we can!

02:40:59.641 --> 02:41:00.589
SAM: Why?

02:41:00.589 --> 02:41:02.560
BRIAN: Because it's delicious!

02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:04.191
MATT: I like that way of thinking.

02:41:04.191 --> 02:41:05.371
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

02:41:05.371 --> 02:41:08.910
BRIAN: We need to get more inside of him in order
for him not to turn into a crazy person!

02:41:08.910 --> 02:41:13.371
MATT: I'm also okay with that. Look, we saved the
Fort as far as I know. Let's go ahead and clear

02:41:13.371 --> 02:41:18.639
out what remains of this Bear Acuda, and then
return to Tova, let her know that it's been

02:41:18.639 --> 02:41:21.849
cleared and take in our ten percent benefits
for--

02:41:21.849 --> 02:41:25.249
LIAM: Yeah. The bongo is no long-o. Let's go reap
the spoils.

02:41:25.249 --> 02:41:33.462
MARISHA: You guys find so much honey. You find
some rare honey, a rare black lotus honey that is

02:41:33.462 --> 02:41:37.912
valued at quite a lot. You find more Balootonium.

02:41:37.912 --> 02:41:40.218
TALIESIN: That honey is worth five honies.

02:41:40.218 --> 02:41:42.301
SAM: Any bamboo?

02:41:42.301 --> 02:41:49.955
MARISHA: Some bamboo, as some of the Bear
Acuda were pandas, but not as much as the honey.

02:41:49.955 --> 02:41:51.787
There doesn't seem to be as much of a market for it.

02:41:51.787 --> 02:41:52.825
SAM: I'll take it.

02:41:52.825 --> 02:41:57.146
BRIAN: I have a question. Can we go back and try
and grab Kody and take him out with us?

02:41:57.158 --> 02:41:58.928
MARISHA: Kody is definitely dead.

02:41:59.217 --> 02:42:06.068
BRIAN: Oh. There's no other prisoners in here
who's not a bad guy?

02:42:06.068 --> 02:42:14.068
MATT: Las Vegas, if anybody asks, he sacrificed himself
bravely and it had nothing to do with my potion.

02:42:14.068 --> 02:42:17.650
BRIAN: No, yeah, I'll write a letter to his family
that explains the whole thing.

02:42:17.916 --> 02:42:21.719
LIAM: Oh yeah, because he was taken down by Bear
Acudas.

02:42:21.719 --> 02:42:26.421
MATT: He was a martyr, and a champion, and I had
nothing to do with it.

02:42:26.421 --> 02:42:29.149
BRIAN: I'll tell them he died of a yak-attack.

02:42:29.149 --> 02:42:32.420
LIAM: His dying words were, "For The Pooh!"

02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:33.759
BRIAN: For The Pooh!

02:42:33.759 --> 02:42:35.225
SAM: He committed bearikiri.

02:42:35.225 --> 02:42:44.465
(laughter)

02:42:44.465 --> 02:42:47.659
BRIAN: Cut the feed! We're done!

02:42:47.914 --> 02:42:56.479
MARISHA: With that, as you all scoop up your
spoils, Tova comes in and graciously congratulates

02:42:56.479 --> 02:43:08.386
all of you. You all are adorned with accolades and
honey for life. You all get new suits. You are

02:43:08.402 --> 02:43:14.322
hired members of the High Bear Nation for
whenever you feel like working, and that is where

02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:18.260
we will end today's Honey Heist 2: Electric Beargaloo.

02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:19.939
SAM: Marisha Ray!

02:43:19.939 --> 02:43:21.158
MATT: That was amazing!

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:22.429
LIAM: Yes!

02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:23.705
BRIAN: That was awesome!

02:43:23.705 --> 02:43:26.025
MARISHA: Thank you, you guys were amazing.

02:43:26.025 --> 02:43:27.694
SAM: The Godfather voice!

02:43:27.694 --> 02:43:29.168
MATT: That was so good!

02:43:29.168 --> 02:43:32.631
MARISHA: What was it, Don Fontaine?

02:43:32.631 --> 02:43:34.170
LIAM: Don LaFontaine?

02:43:34.170 --> 02:43:40.092
MARISHA: Don LaFontaine was his name, though?
Or was it the husband's-- the guy who was

02:43:40.092 --> 02:43:41.142
marrying his daughter?

02:43:41.142 --> 02:43:42.945
SAM: Oh in the movie? Don LaFontaine was a voice
over guy.

02:43:42.945 --> 02:43:45.134
MARISHA: No, but it was Don--

02:43:45.134 --> 02:43:46.916
TALIESIN: It was Don--

02:43:46.916 --> 02:43:49.795
BRIAN: Chat hates us right now.

02:43:49.795 --> 02:43:51.700
MARISHA: I thought that's what you were trying to
quiz me on the husband's name.

02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:53.632
SAM: No, I just wanted a name!

02:43:53.632 --> 02:43:55.117
BRIAN: Oh, it was Don Quixote. I remember now.

02:43:55.117 --> 02:43:59.912
MARISHA: I should have thought of the name of the
husband based on the movie.

02:43:59.912 --> 02:44:02.147
SAM: I don't even know that!

02:44:02.147 --> 02:44:04.198
TALIESIN: Don Nuts.

02:44:04.198 --> 02:44:08.164
LIAM: In a world where honey was the greatest
currency--

02:44:08.164 --> 02:44:12.085
MARISHA: It's something Italian. It was-- I don't
know.

02:44:12.085 --> 02:44:13.762
LIAM: Don Mario Brothers.

02:44:13.762 --> 02:44:15.266
MATT: Don Fettuccine.

02:44:15.266 --> 02:44:20.098
MARISHA: Don Fettuccine, that was the husband's
name. The bear's husband. It was Don Fettuccine.

02:44:20.098 --> 02:44:30.524
Thank you all so much for joining us on whatever
this was. I would like to do a shout out to Grant

02:44:30.524 --> 02:44:40.532
Howitt who wrote this little thing. He also makes
these shirts which have the rules on the shirts,

02:44:40.532 --> 02:44:41.591
which are amazing.

02:44:41.591 --> 02:44:42.516
MATT: The entire rule set.

02:44:42.516 --> 02:44:47.842
MARISHA: I love it. His thing is that he makes a
lot of one-page RPGs that are amazing. He also

02:44:47.842 --> 02:44:56.354
writes on a lot of not one-page RPGs. He's got a
Patreon, he's great, we love him. I think if you

02:44:56.354 --> 02:44:58.539
search Grant Howitt Patreon?

02:44:58.539 --> 02:45:01.015
SAM: Maybe the graphic will come up right now.

02:45:01.015 --> 02:45:03.615
MATT: The graphic is now appearing on the screen!

02:45:03.813 --> 02:45:11.020
MARISHA: This is his Patreon! So yes, thank you to
him for letting us play this amazing game. He's

02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:17.019
got a new one that he just came out with that's a
raccoons racing one?

02:45:17.019 --> 02:45:18.487
TALIESIN: It's a crash--

02:45:18.487 --> 02:45:20.665
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Crash Pandas!

02:45:20.665 --> 02:45:28.464
MARISHA: That's amazing. So yeah, check him out,
and of course go check out our charity 826LA.

02:45:28.464 --> 02:45:36.405
Thank you to everyone who supported and made this
game possible. Of course thank you to Liam Las

02:45:36.405 --> 02:45:44.975
Vegas, Trinket, Peddy Tuxpin, Waffle, and Cookie
for coming back and reprising their roles on this

02:45:44.975 --> 02:45:54.888
weird sequel. With that, thank you for joining us.
Is it Bears-day yet?

02:45:54.888 --> 02:45:59.400
(groaning)

02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:13.448
