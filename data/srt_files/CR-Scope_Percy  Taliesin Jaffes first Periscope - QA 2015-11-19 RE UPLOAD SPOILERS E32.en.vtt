NOTE Paragraph

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:12.528
Oh okay, this is apparently working. Hi, I'm just
trying this out because I saw Matt and Marisha do

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:20.270
it and it was pretty amusing so I thought I would
try this out because why not? Hi, hey, everybody.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.131
I also cleaned my room, so I finally decided it
would be reasonable to see how that worked.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:35.814
(laughs) Oh wow, yes, it is Thursday. And I have
just a tiny bit of time to kill before I have to

00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:44.346
leave the house to go deal with reality. So I did
say I would give a small tour, now that everything

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:56.279
is clean. So yeah. Here, let me show you around.
This is actually my room. I live with roommates so

00:00:56.279 --> 00:01:05.443
this is where I spend most of my time. Here's some
of the Critical Role art on the wall, terrifying

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.819
things. TARDIS closet because why not? Yeah, every
room I've lived in for the past couple years has

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:23.408
been purple. It is a thing. My teeny tiny little
desk is currently ridiculous. My plan for the day

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.390
is to-- I've got to pick up a friend from a VO
meeting and then go say hi to a few people. Here

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.939
is the ridiculous collection of dead things which
goes on forever? That's the project that I'm

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:50.409
working on. I shouldn't show that but. I don't
know, purple just became a thing, it's fun. Here's

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.998
the booklet. This is the really fancy book
collection. Don't know if I can say where I'm

00:01:57.998 --> 00:02:07.629
going today, I tend to try not to say such things.
There's several different skulls, oh yeah, there's

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:18.076
this stuff too-- It's just one of my freeze-dried mice,
little bits and pieces of things. This is kind of

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:28.977
cool. This is a Bioshock fish tank which is
currently on loan from our friend Courtney King,

00:02:28.977 --> 00:02:43.064
who is currently away at college. Our little
bubbly bubbly friend. I do put the mohawk up on

00:02:43.064 --> 00:02:50.764
occasion. It has been quite a while since I've
done-- Just because it's a pain in the ass. I'm

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:54.815
actually going to be messing up my hair quite a
bit soon. There's going to be new hair probably

00:02:54.815 --> 00:03:03.927
after Whitestone. Which will be kind of
ridiculous. We'll see. It's-- I really don't think

00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:12.459
about it as often as I should. Yeah, thank you,
that tank was actually built for a friend of ours

00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:21.965
by Fan Builds. It's the same people who do who do
the sword builds online: Man-at-Arms. You can

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:28.698
check out the whole process that they went through
to build it. There is a video on YouTube. Thank

00:03:28.698 --> 00:03:34.068
you for being a fan, it's fabulous, and yeah,
thank you, the purple refuses to die; it's quite

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:45.675
nice, but man there's going to be some really
ridiculous hair soon. (laugh) I don't know if any

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:53.227
of my friends would appreciate me getting a gun
tattooed on my scalp, but yes, I can't. I'm

00:03:53.227 --> 00:04:00.459
definitely not going to talk about-- I have no idea
what tonight's going to be like but it's

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:11.435
definitely going-- I'm nervous as all hell so that's
always fun. Yeah, the hair will be ridiculous. Do

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:16.178
we watch any other D&D streams? Every now and then
I'll pop into a few of them. I tend to try and

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:22.386
keep quiet. I watch other streams on Geek and
Sundry; Mines and Crafts I'm kind of amused by-- I

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:30.155
find it really nice to clean to. I am very excited
about the conclusion of everything and I'm really

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:36.310
hoping I don't die, but just in case I do, I have
who plans for something else to do. I really am

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:45.351
trying not to bet on it. Singapore! Oh my god. And
as for building I've got a long list of stuff I

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:50.237
want to build that-- I've had a long list of stuff
I wanted to build for years, so I'm just slowly

00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:58.806
making my way through it. Mike McFarland is
amazing to work with, he's super super cool. He's

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:02.909
actually let me crash in his house for a while
when I was living in Texas, and he's crashed in

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:10.766
mine. He is fun to party with, he's fun to work
with, he likes actors. You'd be amazed how many

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:22.385
people don't like to work with actors who work
with actors professionally. Hey! Hi dear. (laughs)

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:29.259
That's awesome. Yeah, I gave a little-- I should
probably give a little bit more of an art tour. I

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:38.668
suppose actually-- Kit, since you're here, I should
show you something. So yeah, that's what your

00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:49.839
stuff looks like framed on the wall. So that
happened. Right kitty corner about the back right

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:59.741
there. I've got some Community prints that I got a
while back. You could focus-- Some ridiculous

00:05:59.741 --> 00:06:07.154
stuff-- vintage-y creepy photos that everyone has to
do. We're hoping Ashley comes back. There's a

00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:16.358
little crocheted TARDIS because those are
adorable. Yes, and Mary Blair because Mary Blair

00:06:16.358 --> 00:06:28.830
is awesome. My copy of Kamondi the Last Boy on
Earth. My little ridiculous goth kid collection of

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:42.170
dead things. I couldn't be happier with how
Percy's story has been coming out. It's really the

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:52.522
best I could have possibly hoped for. It's
everything I want and more. Oh yeah, I should show

00:06:52.522 --> 00:06:59.288
you one of my cousin's photos. That's right, I'm
amazed that you remember that. Here's my dead

00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:11.825
cousin on the wall, bless her heart, having
fallen down the stairs (laughs) Yeah, I have a

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:19.048
feeling that the sisters is going to go really
badly. Oh God we have so much. I try-- Almost all

00:07:19.048 --> 00:07:26.348
the art in my house is my friends of mine with
some exceptions. So it's one of the reasons why we

00:07:26.348 --> 00:07:32.822
have lots of really nice art is that we get friend
discounts. There's another couple wonderful friend

00:07:33.109 --> 00:07:38.642
discount pieces. If you have friends who are
artists it's a really good way to get your house

00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:47.942
filled with nice stuff. This is another friend,
Laura Peters, who did the four of these. Oh yeah,

00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:52.413
no. Actually, there might be mild nudity in the
background and I do apologize. This is kind of a

00:07:52.413 --> 00:08:06.602
fun piece as well. But yeah, we collect. A lot of
the art, a lot of the art models, and all of these

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:11.834
paintings are actually friends as well. It's kind
of-- My roommates and I have known each other for

00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:22.592
a very long time, and we know the community around
here. Yay mild nudity. Adventurers' League game,

00:08:22.932 --> 00:08:31.012
no. I don't know what the D&D Adventurers' League
game is. But yeah, the stained glass spiderwebs

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:39.104
I've had since I was a teenager. Hi from Germany.
Again, all these places I've never been. I have

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:45.523
two roommates at the moment, and I have two cats
and we have chickens. Yes, I like Tuck's gift

00:08:45.523 --> 00:08:51.882
although I haven't finished reading it yet.
There's a lot there. No, although we do have voice

00:08:51.882 --> 00:08:58.851
actors come crash on our couch every now and then.
The cats are currently in trouble because they

00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:08.861
discovered one of the roommate's yarn collections.
That did not go well. Wow, yeah, actually, I'll go

00:09:08.861 --> 00:09:16.382
annoy the chickens, that's pretty adorable. It's
going to get very bright very quickly and I

00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:20.858
apologize for that and currently I don't-- I don't
know if you guys know, but California is

00:09:20.858 --> 00:09:30.108
currently-- Drought's the word. The garden is
currently dead and being replanted. We have a

00:09:30.108 --> 00:09:44.583
little studio in the back. They think they're
getting fed, they're so excited. You guys are not

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:59.328
getting fed. No, I'm just going to sit here and
stare at you. They are dumb as sticks, but they

00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:11.956
definitely give us eggs and occasionally soup.
They're cute. Hi guys. And yes, they are very

00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:19.527
loud. Studio-- I'll show the studio at another
time. It's currently locked up at the moment but

00:10:19.527 --> 00:10:29.136
that would be-- Do that some other time? Hi from
Canada. Also, god I do actually travel, I swear,

00:10:29.136 --> 00:10:37.179
but these are all places I haven't been. I just
got back from Alaska, which was amazing, in San

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:43.317
Francisco to see my brother. Other than that?
Chicago I've been to, thank god, I love Chicago

00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:48.896
and Portland. I love Portland, I actually have a
lot of friends in Portland. Hopefully we'll be

00:10:48.896 --> 00:10:58.077
going back soon. I am working on it. Have I been
to Compton? Actually yes, I have friends in

00:10:58.077 --> 00:11:07.698
Compton. We hang out on occasion. It's been a
while, but you know. I don't know if I'm coming to

00:11:07.698 --> 00:11:14.368
A-Kon, and in fact if you would like any of the
Critical Role people at your conventions, just bug

00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:20.087
your conventions about it, and we'll try, although
we can only travel so much during the year before

00:11:20.087 --> 00:11:32.426
we all fall down and lapse into comas. How do I
roll so many D20s? I don't know and it could end

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:38.628
at any moment. I don't know if you saw me on Group
Hug, but those were not my dice, and I still

00:11:38.628 --> 00:11:46.940
rolled really really well. I think for every Wil
Wheaton in the world there's an anti-Wheaton, and

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:54.483
maybe I've just gotten lucky. But yeah, well, I
sacrificed chickens for good soup at the very

00:11:54.792 --> 00:12:02.443
least so. But that is-- we'll see, perhaps tonight
will be the night where I roll terribly and

00:12:02.443 --> 00:12:11.125
everybody dies. (laughs) But yeah, we're hoping to
come to the UK soon, that would be really cool.

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:18.253
And we'll see how the Briarwoods and I'm really--
I'm genuinely very very nervous. Thursdays are

00:12:18.253 --> 00:12:25.171
always nerve-wracking until we get to the studio.
And then it all kind of chills out once we're

00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:33.064
actually playing. It does not say "Silas loves
you," it just says some other things. What are

00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:39.083
we-- oh? Nothing fun yet. Oh, my chalkboard
changes every month or so depending on what I'm

00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:45.321
working on. I had a big glass closet mirror at my
last place I lived and I would cover it in notes.

00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:55.160
But that was a while ago. The chickens are
definitely sacrificial. Man, there's nothing that

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:01.625
reinforces the theory of being a carnivore like
owning chickens. They are walking meat. It is

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:14.141
just-- (laughs) Is Percy going to turn evil? God, I
hope not. Critmas is already a technical

00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:22.284
nightmare. I don't know if we could possibly put
more effort into that than the show some nights.

00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:31.592
There has not been one that has gone smoothly. We
don't know if Ashley's going to be there. We're

00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:39.713
trying <i>really</i> hard because it would make life so
much easier if she could be there tonight. But

00:13:39.713 --> 00:13:54.562
it's still up in the air; she is sadly at the
mercy of larger forces. Oh, thank you. I surround

00:13:54.562 --> 00:14:03.841
myself with badass and adorable people and they
just rub off. We've actually done a couple LA

00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:11.083
Critter meetups, when Kit was in town. Possibly at
some point-- that's actually not a bad idea.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:16.611
There're a couple coffee shops, and I'll tell you
what-- if I get work done. I know this is a

00:14:16.611 --> 00:14:21.224
terrible way to do things, but I go to coffee
shops to work and if I have one of those days

00:14:21.224 --> 00:14:31.304
where I get work done really quickly, I'll just
tweet out where I am. I really like Moby's-- was

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:35.911
where we had the last one. I do spend a lot of
time at Moby's Coffee Shop. The Bourgeois Pig also

00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:43.504
is really nice. One question: Lilith or Zahra? But
that's not fair. I refuse to answer that,

00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:54.983
especially with one of them listening. Crit Role
flashmob. That would be great. The comic, yeah, I

00:14:54.983 --> 00:14:59.603
suppose I should describe-- put out some words
about the comic really quickly, that would

00:14:59.603 --> 00:15:07.081
be helpful. Geek and Sundry basically said
that they wanted to do a Critical Role comic and

00:15:07.081 --> 00:15:14.557
we were-- Marisha and I write stuff together
anyways. This is what we do for-- I'd say fun, but

00:15:14.858 --> 00:15:19.147
what we do to make money. We're like, Great.
That's a great idea. We've already got some

00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:24.873
thoughts and I'm like, <i>but</i> we want to do four
panels a week. So we want to do a comic strip for

00:15:24.873 --> 00:15:35.004
four panels a week. We're like okay. We can do
that, too. So it's going to be-- There's only so

00:15:35.004 --> 00:15:41.766
much story you can tell in four panels, so our
first run of six or seven is very light-hearted.

00:15:41.766 --> 00:15:50.965
It's very simple-- well, we're kind of going very
Calvin and Hobbes-ish with the whole vibe of it

00:15:50.965 --> 00:15:56.663
keeping it very sweet and very cute. It does tell
a story that will be-- I'm going to do at least

00:15:56.663 --> 00:16:01.822
little liner note blurbs for all of them or
Marisha will do a few explaining what we're doing

00:16:02.122 --> 00:16:10.444
and why. But please, if you do post it online,
link to the actual page because we did write

00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:16.483
something for that and also the more views it
gets, the more likely they'll be to say Let's do a

00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:28.242
full comic book now. Or maybe something else cool.
So, please. The full story is basically, okay, I

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:33.276
suppose I'm going to write this down at some
point, but I'll do it now. I'll at least explain

00:16:33.276 --> 00:16:41.274
some of it now. Our first Winter's Crest festival
game was basically divided into two parts and the

00:16:41.274 --> 00:16:46.674
first half of the night was very much fun and
ridiculous and basically all of us running around

00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:51.296
a festival. And then the second half of the game
is where the festival all broke down into giant

00:16:51.296 --> 00:16:57.273
chaos and we had to fight stuff and things got
crazy. So the comic strip is basically a lot of

00:16:57.273 --> 00:17:03.640
the little vignettes of things that happened at
the festival. Which we then filled in and I'll get

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:09.053
to this later, but we then filled in with some
stories of our group trip to the Renaissance Faire

00:17:09.053 --> 00:17:14.374
which was very much in line with the Winter's
Crest festival. And we may even be showing some

00:17:14.374 --> 00:17:21.674
pictures of the group trip to the Renaissance
Faire and how that all turned out. This is

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:28.204
ridiculous. There's no part of my room that isn't
a purple background. Yeah, so everything was

00:17:28.204 --> 00:17:34.515
pretty much pre-Critical Role, and we did do a
group trip to Renaissance Faire which was pretty

00:17:34.515 --> 00:17:40.835
ridiculous? I think a few photos of that are
online, and so the comic strip will all be social

00:17:40.835 --> 00:17:45.555
encounters. There will be no battle in the comic
strip. But it will also lead into something else

00:17:45.555 --> 00:17:53.593
that we're working on that I can't talk about yet,
but there's a few really cool things. I love the

00:17:53.593 --> 00:18:02.493
Texas Renaissance Faire. I've been there several
times. So, there'll be some stuff connecting into

00:18:02.493 --> 00:18:07.591
that but I can't-- I would get killed, I will get
start getting text messages from everybody else

00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:15.452
telling me to shush. And yeah, how am I doing on
time before I have to-- no I've got a few more

00:18:15.452 --> 00:18:28.883
minutes. Whose backstory do I really-- I'm hoping
we hold off on Grog until Pike gets back because

00:18:28.883 --> 00:18:40.054
they're kind of interwoven. Honestly I really want
to get into Scanlan, and I really liked our one

00:18:40.054 --> 00:18:45.935
dip into Keyleth, and I know out of game some of
the stuff that's going on with Keyleth, so I'm

00:18:45.935 --> 00:18:54.914
kind of down with that. I mean, I'd love to see
the twins too, but again, like of what I know,

00:18:54.914 --> 00:18:59.964
there's like weird stuff with Scanlan we haven't
gotten into and there's weird stuff with Keyleth

00:18:59.964 --> 00:19:08.162
that we haven't gotten into. Has Matt ever let
anything slip before a game that helped you guys

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:20.314
out? No. The most he said was five months ago when
he asked me for my updated backstory document. And

00:19:20.314 --> 00:19:29.713
his only comment was you should really get that
shit together soon, would be nice. And, but again,

00:19:29.713 --> 00:19:33.974
it's been three years. Yeah fear of orcs. There's
just something there I really want to get into,

00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:46.305
and maybe will again. We never know where we're
going to go with any of this and Matt's always got

00:19:46.305 --> 00:19:54.766
everything worked out. Oh, thank you. Have fun at
work, or you know, have a productive day of work,

00:19:54.766 --> 00:20:00.550
and hopefully there'll be an episode for you
tonight. Nothing will go terribly wrong. The

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:11.942
vampire bit was entirely his idea. I didn't tell
Matt when it came to Percy's backstory-- I didn't

00:20:11.942 --> 00:20:20.925
tell Matt anything that Percy didn't know. I just
described the events as best as Percy could

00:20:20.925 --> 00:20:26.003
describe them. So he didn't know anything about
who the Briarwoods were, he didn't know whether or

00:20:26.003 --> 00:20:37.353
not his sister was dead or alive. He-- it was just
his experience. And I did not multi-class into

00:20:37.353 --> 00:20:42.515
warlock. I know everyone keeps thinking that I
did, but that is not what happened. It's the comic

00:20:42.515 --> 00:20:48.984
strip going to be in iambic pentameter? The comic
strip is going to have almost no dialogue, so yes?

00:20:48.984 --> 00:21:01.475
We'll go with yes. Yeah, well the pics in Percy's
video were all chosen by Matt, and we're again--

00:21:01.475 --> 00:21:15.948
hmm can't talk. Where do I want the art to go?
Yeah Wendy's killing it. I don't think about where

00:21:16.256 --> 00:21:22.437
I want the art to go. I'm invested in the game, so
I don't-- I know that there's a lot of

00:21:22.437 --> 00:21:32.089
speculation. As a group we don't really speculate,
if that makes sense? We're not really-- we mostly

00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:39.540
just sit around and giggle. Oh hey, Kyle, I didn't
see you there. What's up, man? A lot of friends

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:52.946
watching this, this is very odd. But yeah, we
don't really speculate as a group. Matt and I had

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:58.559
a lot of talks about the level up and I was
staring at Luck for a little while because it

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:05.661
would have been so useful, but it seemed kind of
cowardly to take for a character like mine, whose

00:22:05.661 --> 00:22:15.659
disadvantages are all based on the ability for
everything he has to go wrong? And the magic

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:24.575
initiate just made sense. That maybe Is kind of a
good character moment to start taking advantage of

00:22:24.575 --> 00:22:31.239
his ability to having-- like that bonus d6 came
out of nowhere, and we just sort of turned it into

00:22:31.239 --> 00:22:40.327
a thing. What's the most ridiculous thing that
party Percy has done? Sam Riegel is the best at

00:22:40.327 --> 00:22:53.848
ridiculous. He really is good at coming up-- His
very first usage of Burt Reynolds was amazing. But

00:22:53.848 --> 00:23:01.969
It's definitely-- Percy's most ridiculous, I'm not
entirely sure there was there was some there were

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.750
some good pre-stream stuff that was-- I felt bad
because the stream came in and like when we

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:11.211
started this, we were in a story arc that Percy
had very little-- Percy was just uncomfortable and

00:23:11.211 --> 00:23:17.402
tired and cold and really not enjoying himself and
then also the stream took a little while to get

00:23:17.402 --> 00:23:28.720
used to. it was a little odd. Burt Reynolds came
from Sam's depraved imagination. And I'll say with

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.279
the magic initiate thing, it was perfect also
because Percy's never really going to delve into

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:38.130
magic because it's just not his jam. And so, it's
perfect to give him just the touch of it, but now

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.079
I can kind of move on and again, there's a couple
cantrips that help me and they're really

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:51.332
wonderfully character appropriate, and they'll
come out soon. He probably does; he was very proud

00:23:51.332 --> 00:23:57.442
and excited to play Starscream. Care to share any
of Percy's next tinkerings? I'll share one of

00:23:57.442 --> 00:24:05.020
them, which is I need a better and easier way to
make bullets. Not bullets technically, but musket

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:14.652
balls. So that's going to be a big thing and then
getting the Diplomacy glove to function a little

00:24:14.652 --> 00:24:22.272
more easily as required. Silencer actually
weirdly-- the problem with the silencer is to use

00:24:22.272 --> 00:24:29.781
the technology and the time to build a silencer
means it's one use which is a lot of effort for

00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:41.170
one shot, and it's just not useful. I've explained
who the last barrel's for. This story arc is the

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.197
darkest moment other than other than Pike nearly
dying. This is pretty much the darkest moment

00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:51.687
we've ever had. I think this is going to be the
last episode. Again. I can't guarantee it, but it

00:24:51.687 --> 00:25:01.898
really feels like that. Yeah, I've been I've been
showing-- part of the deal with the inventions

00:25:01.898 --> 00:25:12.467
that Percy makes is I really have to make a case
to Matt that I could build it back then (laughs)

00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:19.619
So yeah, I've got lots and lots of pictures right
now sharing about the glove works and going no

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:27.659
really this will work, I've got a plan. The Sun
Tree is interesting as the Sun Tree was entirely

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:34.817
invented by Matt. I don't know what the first
official how do you want to do this was. I think

00:25:34.817 --> 00:25:38.559
it's just something he said from the get-go. He
might have even been saying in our previous game

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:46.497
that we played. I promise you that whatever
happens with Percy it will be somebody else who

00:25:46.497 --> 00:25:55.707
kills him. Yeah, I actually like-- the interesting
thing is I do actually know how a shot was made. I

00:25:55.707 --> 00:26:04.602
used to work in the educational group that did the
Renaissance Faire teaching military history to

00:26:04.602 --> 00:26:11.117
kids, a history of weaponry and development so I
actually have a design for basically a thing that

00:26:11.117 --> 00:26:18.717
would actually make them at a much higher rate.
One of the first--it was actually a just pre-Civil

00:26:18.717 --> 00:26:25.608
War system for making ammo at high speeds, but I
have to just run it by him. And I actually have to

00:26:25.608 --> 00:26:35.647
make it and the rolls are always really tricky.
Yeah, that kit is awesome, I'm highly entertained

00:26:35.647 --> 00:26:44.228
and I'm going to use it for things at some point
in the near future. No, the fun names actually

00:26:44.228 --> 00:26:53.957
usually come in the moment. I don't really plan--
I don't plan anything. I really don't. There are no

00:26:53.957 --> 00:27:02.690
stupid questions. Just stupid people. No, Mercer
is an evil twisted bastard. Yeah, every good man

00:27:03.013 --> 00:27:09.681
has a bad man inside and making it all possible.
What's the one thing you hope will happen to Percy

00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:20.191
in the future? I would like the weight of this
hanging over him to get shifted. I would like--

00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:31.691
Thanks Kyle-- I would like I would like to try
playing the character without him-- having a new

00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:43.101
attitude towards himself, and I'm kind of curious
to see if that works out. And Percy is a nobleman.

00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:55.702
They don't marry for anything other than property,
so marriage is about property. Fun is fun. Letting

00:27:55.702 --> 00:28:06.121
this go. How many plague masks have I gotten? None
actually, although I have a friend who's probably

00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:14.681
going to build me an official one at some point
based off of our very serious designs. I can show

00:28:14.681 --> 00:28:22.382
this really quick. We all miss Hannibal. This is
the raving hat collection. That goes on forever,

00:28:22.382 --> 00:28:26.640
and you can see a couple of the masks, and then we
actually have some of our masks. We have a bit of

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:38.680
a mask collection on the wall, a few of the masks
are hiding in here and we have more-- we actually

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:53.442
have hat boxes filled with stuff. Oh the hats.
There's my Mad Hatter hat so that's a thing. Oh

00:28:53.442 --> 00:29:02.431
God more hats. No. We have too much stuff. I'm not
going to feel guilty. We're going to be angry at

00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:09.401
Matt if the party TPKs really. Does the de Rolo
coat of arms have a family motto? Yes, it does

00:29:09.401 --> 00:29:13.973
although I haven't had it translated into Latin
yet, which is why I haven't put it out there. But

00:29:14.363 --> 00:29:20.252
the English translation is "The fool sees not the
tree the wise man sees." I've been trying to get

00:29:20.252 --> 00:29:28.772
that translated into Latin. Yeah, no, I
like the big battles because what's a game without

00:29:28.772 --> 00:29:35.643
risk? And the game's not entertaining without
really poor decisions and bad ideas. Poor

00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:47.632
decisions and bad ideas are what make a great
game. "The fool sees not the tree the wise man

00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:59.063
"sees." So I love it when everything goes wrong.
It's so much more fun when everything goes wrong.

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:06.341
And I'm excited to see everything go wrong
tonight. I want it to be horrible, I want it to be

00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:21.914
terrifying. The triceratops was genius, Grog
running in screaming bloody murder was genius. I

00:30:22.136 --> 00:30:28.934
mean that just turned into a giant cluster of
stupid that was just fun to watch. Keyleth

00:30:28.934 --> 00:30:34.565
breaking off and running into the-- And we knew
she was going to do it-- Keyleth breaking off and

00:30:34.565 --> 00:30:41.185
running into the skeletons was great because then
it means that led to the phenomenal return of--

00:30:41.185 --> 00:30:49.484
you couldn't have had Pike pull that off. The Pike
moment was built by just the sorts of character

00:30:49.484 --> 00:30:58.256
decisions that lead to a good game. Is that a
Frank Lloyd Wright conversation? I am actually not

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:04.219
named after the Frank Lloyd Wright house, I'm
named after a Welsh bard, but his house is named

00:31:04.219 --> 00:31:17.386
after the same person I am. Love me some Keyleth
Jenkins. I actually I will say that-- Keyleth is

00:31:17.386 --> 00:31:24.725
one of my favorite characters in the game. Just
because she leads to some-- Too many people play--

00:31:24.725 --> 00:31:31.846
I like that some people play smart. I try and play
smart just because I was brought into the game as

00:31:31.846 --> 00:31:38.886
kind of a ringer originally. The idea being like,
we have all these new people and then we need

00:31:38.886 --> 00:31:47.037
somebody who's played the game, who can kind of
just be there to make sure nothing horrible happens.

00:31:47.037 --> 00:31:54.695
And so part of Percy's original intent was to sort
of be a safety net and to let everybody figure out

00:31:54.893 --> 00:32:02.102
what the game was for and not getting away, which
was also why he's kind of meek. His design was to

00:32:02.102 --> 00:32:08.574
sort of sit there, and just be a cannon for those
moments where everything goes wrong. Yes, the

00:32:08.574 --> 00:32:16.175
Tiger Lilies are amazing! I love them. I've seen
them live a couple times. But now that's kind of

00:32:16.427 --> 00:32:21.567
not an issue anymore. And now it's just like-- I
love it that there's people who play it safe. And

00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:28.620
I'm trying to play it less safe, but like Scanlan
and Keyleth know how to-- and Grog really know how

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:33.149
to not play it safe I don't think we can handle
one more person not playing it safe, but

00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:42.912
you really need players who
are willing to jump into the fray. CHVRCHES

00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:52.806
is amazing. I haven't seen them play live yet, but
I really like CHVRCHES. Vax definitely

00:32:53.078 --> 00:33:02.186
overestimates himself which is great and Vex can
be bought, which is great. I love that we have a

00:33:02.186 --> 00:33:08.566
character that can be bought, we have a character
that overestimates themselves, we have a character

00:33:08.566 --> 00:33:20.234
who is way too interested in violence, we have a
character who's way too ADD and then we have a

00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:28.195
character who's morally obligated to be Superman
and it's great. Really Kyle? I'll double-check

00:33:28.195 --> 00:33:34.757
that but I have a friend with a-- my poor friend
with a Latin degree, and I have to make sure that

00:33:34.757 --> 00:33:44.145
she feels useful on occasion. Percy doesn't have
tension with anybody in the party. Percy I would

00:33:44.145 --> 00:33:50.877
imagine is probably closest to Keyleth. It's just
because he's kind of snobby and she's titled and

00:33:50.877 --> 00:33:58.156
no matter how nice and kind he is he definitely
had a lifetime of understanding the difference

00:33:58.156 --> 00:34:05.945
between having a title and not having a title. I
thought about "Gun" for CHVRCHES, and I just

00:34:05.945 --> 00:34:12.665
didn't-- at some point in the near future,
maybe even a day if I'm feeling fancy, I'm going

00:34:12.665 --> 00:34:17.955
to take my personal Percy playlist-- my personal
Percy playlist. That's a lot of alliteration and

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:25.684
augment it on my on my Spotify playlist and add
some of the songs that I cut, and a few more that

00:34:25.684 --> 00:34:36.466
I thought about putting on but like didn't quite
hit. I know I call it pulling the Gendo Ikari.

00:34:36.466 --> 00:34:44.596
That's how I think-- any time I'm doing that I'm
looking at the board thinking really hard, and I'm

00:34:44.817 --> 00:34:51.316
trying to get out of the-- There are so many
things we didn't have to think about before we

00:34:51.316 --> 00:34:59.517
were streaming that now we have to think about?
It's the Gendo and I'm trying really hard to stop

00:34:59.517 --> 00:35:12.328
doing that but it's-- God. It's such a nice way to
think. So much forehead! But yes I am aware and

00:35:12.328 --> 00:35:17.917
It's one of those things that I try and do less
and one of the ways I do that is I try and have a

00:35:18.128 --> 00:35:26.267
coffee mug in front of me at all times because it
gives me something to do with my hands. I love

00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:33.404
Gendo, he's such a mess. I'm a mess. Believe me. I'm a
mess. I'm sure at some point we'll do one of these

00:35:33.404 --> 00:35:41.307
where we talk about-- No one ends up doing stuff
like this for a living without having some serious

00:35:41.307 --> 00:35:53.775
personal issues. I don't remember. I'm pretty sure
we're taking next week off. So, I would guess.

00:35:54.604 --> 00:35:59.614
Thank you. That show I never got to see but I'm
a big fan of the soundtrack of it, the Tom Waits.

00:35:59.614 --> 00:36:06.720
Tom Waits also has like seven albums that are
playing non-stop. But any last questions before I

00:36:06.962 --> 00:36:26.601
kill the stream? Whoa. Oh my god. Back to-- What
did I think of Sam losing to Liam in the great who

00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:37.763
looks better-- actually I voted for Liam. I may
have inspired that. (laughs) They were arguing about it on

00:36:37.763 --> 00:36:44.654
our-- there was a little cute back and forth on
our text stream, and I said take a Twitter poll

00:36:44.976 --> 00:36:52.104
and Sam went, "I <i>will</i> take a Twitter poll!" and
posted it at the very next moment and so I was

00:36:52.104 --> 00:37:01.964
kind of giggling at his hubris. What will Percy's
primary motivation be after the Briarwoods are

00:37:02.183 --> 00:37:06.594
gone? I don't know, what does somebody do when
they've been in the revenge business for so long,

00:37:06.594 --> 00:37:13.333
maybe Dread Pirate Roberts. I'm not sure.
Cassandra may or may not be a vampire. I don't

00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:18.883
know what's going to happen. I'm trying to see if
I have a picture of the actual Cassandra around

00:37:18.883 --> 00:37:31.224
here. Almost all of my siblings are named after
friends of mine. And I'm trying to see if there's

00:37:31.224 --> 00:37:36.932
a picture of Cassandra in the bathroom, that would
be funny. She's painted blue, that's no help.

00:37:36.932 --> 00:37:48.602
(laughs) But yeah, we'll see. It depends on how
things go. Anyway guys, this has been fun. Thank

00:37:48.602 --> 00:37:54.848
you for checking this out, and I'll see you
tonight. Talk to you later.
