NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:05.470
LAURA: Hello and welcome to another exciting
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:15.654
nerdy-ass voice actors, jesus, sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons. Oh gosh, okay, so this is my

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:21.693
one-shot. I'm nervous as all hell, but it's going
to be great! If you have may have noticed,

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:31.597
tonight's episode takes place at the-- please
don't sue us-- school of Schmogwarts. First,

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:37.663
before all of that, let's get to some
announcements. Our sponsor for the night is--

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:40.190
TRAVIS: Oh, I got it! Model this, Brian.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.193
BRIAN: I got it.

00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:45.391
TRAVIS: Tonight's episode is sponsored by D&D Art
& Arcana from Random House Publishing and Ten

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:49.598
Speed Press. Gamers and game historians Sam and
Michael Witwer, Kyle Newman, and Jon Peterson have

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:53.918
taken on this massive archaeological effort to
create a must-have book for anyone who has ever

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:59.153
played or just loves D&D. It's over 700 images of
original art, unpublished draft material, pristine

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:04.086
product, rare imagery, and the most extensive
collection of D&D imagery every published. The

00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:09.578
special edition of this book comes with all this
beautifulness right here, ten classic mini prints

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:15.058
of D&D artwork ready for hanging, a pamphlet-sized
unpublished original version of Gary Gygax's Tomb

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:22.101
of Horrors, and this 450 page book of legendary
D&D art is available now. So help support the show

00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:28.102
by grabbing your copy at
critrole.com/artandarcana.

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:31.539
LAURA: Sorry to interrupt you, but our poster is
in this freaking book!

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.309
SAM: Wait, what? No, it's not.

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:34.819
LAURA: Yes, it is. It's at the end of the book.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.200
SAM: We're not an official thing, though. We're
just a mom and pop thing; we don't really exist.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.947
LAURA: It's at the very end, Brian, at the very
end.

00:01:40.947 --> 00:01:42.511
BRIAN: Oh very end, I thought you said very
beginning.

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.458
TALIESIN: Only 70% of the show is mom and pop.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:49.596
LIAM: I've looked through it, it's a beautiful
book and if you've been a D&D fan for decades,

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:52.394
going through the book is like going through a
time warp.

00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:55.269
LAURA: There it is! There's our poster!

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:56.799
SAM: Our poster is in the book?

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.273
LAURA: Isn't that so exciting?

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:00.051
LIAM: We're part of the history of Dungeons &
Dragons!

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.816
TRAVIS: You can grab your copy at
critrole.com/artandarcana.

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:06.463
LAURA: Yay!

00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:07.400
SAM: Good job, Travis!

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.879
TRAVIS: Thanks, man. It would have been Sam, but
he's sweating his new class.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.780
LAURA: Before we get to that, the latest episode
of Between the Sheets featuring our very own

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.835
Marisha Ray is now available on the Critical Role
YouTube channel. You can tune in at

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:29.671
twitch.tv/criticalrole on Monday for a one-on-one
chat-- oh!-- with Matthew Mercer.

00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:31.301
SAM: That's coming up next Monday.

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:32.752
BRIAN: Next Monday, yeah.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:39.587
LAURA: Then the all new episode of All Work No
Play will debut on twitch.tv/criticalrole: that's

00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:40.639
our channel.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.688
TRAVIS: That's it.

00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:44.137
LAURA: Jeez, this is hard. On Friday at 7:00pm
Pacific.

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:46.036
SAM and LAURA: That's tomorrow.

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:48.051
SAM: I think it's going to be a spooky-ooky
episode.

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:49.242
LIAM: It's the spooky-ooky one?

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:50.368
SAM: I think so.

00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:55.584
LAURA: Yeah, where you guys pair up with makeup
artist Alexander Ward, right? Creature artist?

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:58.365
SAM: Creature master.

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.848
LIAM: Creature, just creature.

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:04.633
LAURA: I've seen some of the pictures from it and
it is freaking amazing.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.661
TALIESIN: He's been giggling about it.

00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:10.860
LAURA: I wish this freaking announcement sheet was
longer, because now it means that we have to get

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:14.773
to the game. So I guess--

00:03:14.773 --> 00:03:16.108
TRAVIS: Start making it up right now.

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:20.600
LAURA: Without further ado, let's-- I don't know--
should we roll credits or something?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.147
TRAVIS: On tonight's episode of--

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:26.246
LAURA: Tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:03:26.648 --> 00:03:59.927
[magical music]

00:04:02.857 --> 00:04:09.552
LAURA: (intones Hedwig's theme) It's a crisp
autumn morning. It's starting; I'm starting it,

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:17.601
bitches. It's a crisp autumn morning at
Schmogwarts. It's a holiday weekend and all of

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:25.442
your students at the school are off celebrating
off at the local town of Schmogsmeade. Celebrating

00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:29.890
their latest squidlach win or lamenting their
team's loss.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.418
TRAVIS: Squidlach?

00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:34.297
BRIAN: Uh-huh, you remember.

00:04:34.297 --> 00:04:43.920
LAURA: They're sipping nutterbeer at the Five
Brooms or buying sweets at the local goody shop.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.938
LIAM: Nutterbeer is an acquired taste.

00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:50.822
LAURA: It is, it's really good. All of the
students and faculty, except, that is, for you

00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:59.567
five. No, you five are in detention. You've been
asked to serve in the Defense Against the Dark

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:15.870
Farts classroom. As you file in, early in the
morning, the first student to walk in is a

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.969
Dryffingor. Sam, why don't you describe your
character?

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.004
SAM: I'm first? Oh god, are we doing accents?

00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:28.598
TRAVIS: First is the worst, tool. Yes.

00:05:28.598 --> 00:05:31.806
SAM: We're doing accents? All British?

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.424
LAURA: Do it! Go for it, Sam.

00:05:33.424 --> 00:05:35.542
TRAVIS: No, this is all Litish.

00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:45.663
SAM: Hello. My name is Claire Sittish. I'm a
Briffinbore?

00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:48.130
LAURA: No, you're a Dryffingor, get it right.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.499
SAM: I'm a Dryffingor... student? Am I a student?
I don't even know.

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.399
LAURA: Jesus. Yes, you're a student.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.403
SAM: There's no bio!

00:05:54.403 --> 00:05:55.741
LAURA: I sent you a thing, Sam!

00:05:55.741 --> 00:06:03.421
SAM: You did? Oh boy, I don't know, I didn't read
it. My name's Claire Sittish. I come from a well

00:06:03.421 --> 00:06:11.899
to-do family and I'm quite admired all around the
school. The underclassmen, the upperclassmen, the

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:21.570
5th years, the 9th years, the 12th years, they all
love me. I haven't read Harry Potter. But I'm

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:31.376
supes popular and if you ask me to go to prom,
I'll say no. I'm also a super awesome wizard and

00:06:31.376 --> 00:06:35.589
cross me and I will fuck your shit up.

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:37.655
LAURA: Technically, you're a witch. But whatever.

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:38.890
SAM: Sure. And I've got red hair.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.952
LAURA: Yes, you do.

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:43.744
SAM: I'm styling and that's it.

00:06:43.744 --> 00:06:47.937
LAURA: You walk in and you sit towards the front
of the classroom like you normally do.

00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:49.240
SAM: I shouldn't be here.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.649
LAURA: You're followed in immediately after by a
slight gentleman, rather small of frame. Brian,

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.014
why don't you tell us about your character.

00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:10.716
BRIAN: 'Ello. My name's Bryan and--

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:14.860
LAURA: (singing) And I like to do drawings!

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:31.582
BRIAN: I don't get out a lot these days but when I
do, it's to get maybe some comics. I'm built like

00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:38.095
the Olsen twins. That's it.

00:07:38.095 --> 00:07:41.022
LAURA: All right, and what house are you?

00:07:41.022 --> 00:07:44.910
BRIAN: I'm a Pigeonclaw.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.171
LAURA: All right. Bryan, you follow in behind
Claire. You think about sitting next to her, but

00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:56.366
you've always been uncomfortable around girls, so
you end up taking a seat in the row behind her,

00:07:56.366 --> 00:08:05.048
off to the side. Following in behind Bryan is an
athletic, built guy. He seems really cool. He's a

00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:08.815
Smytherpin. Taliesin--

00:08:08.815 --> 00:08:14.083
TALIESIN: Slytherpin. My name's Andy. Everyone
knows me, to be fair. I'm a beater for the

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:20.172
Slytherpin squidlach team. We're doing very well
this year. We might take it all the way to

00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:30.290
tri-nationals as it's going. I don't care who you
people are. Hi, dear.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.996
LAURA: Andy comes in and sits next to Claire. You
guys are pretty familiar with each other being

00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:36.777
both popular students.

00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:38.828
SAM: What's that smell?

00:08:38.828 --> 00:08:41.538
TALIESIN: Victory. That's the smell of victory.

00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:44.797
SAM: Is it sweat? It's sweat. You should go take a
shower.

00:08:44.797 --> 00:08:49.229
BRIAN: I also might have brought some brussel
sprouts with me in my bag.

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:52.687
SAM: Why would you do-- did your mother pack it
for you?

00:08:52.687 --> 00:08:56.205
BRIAN: Yeah.

00:08:56.205 --> 00:08:58.767
LAURA: Your mother spends a lot of time at
Schmogwarts?

00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:06.206
BRIAN: No, she packed it before I left, months
ago. That's probably why they smell so bad.

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:12.530
LAURA: All of you look to the back of the
classroom as a commotion happens. A very tall

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:17.619
student, disheveled. He'd be handsome if he didn't
look so scruffy, maybe. Walks in, he's knocked

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:21.490
over a stack of books as he walks in to take his
seat. Travis?

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:27.411
TRAVIS: (Spits)

00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:28.852
SAM: Disgusting.

00:09:28.852 --> 00:09:35.048
TRAVIS: Nerd. My name's John Bunder. I don't give
a shit about anything or anyone.

00:09:35.048 --> 00:09:37.082
LIAM: Ooh, a Yorkshire accent.

00:09:37.082 --> 00:09:49.299
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I forgot, yeah. We're all Litish.
I'm also in house Smytherpin. Smytherpin!

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:52.136
TALIESIN: Smytherpin. I wrote it down wrong.

00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:57.059
TRAVIS: I've been here every day of my life and
I'll probably be here even longer. This accent

00:09:57.059 --> 00:10:07.039
might change in a couple minutes, just so you
know. You people are in here with me. Not me in

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:11.401
here with you. Whatever.

00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:15.651
LAURA: Bunder comes in and stares all of you down
as he takes a seat a couple rows behind Claire and

00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:26.761
Andy. All of you stare at each other in silence
until a young Horfleporf walks into the classroom.

00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:33.150
She's got scarves all around her face, her hair is
all disheveled, and it's odd because instead of

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:40.021
walking behind you, she walks all the way in front
of your desks, around the classroom before filing

00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:43.853
in and taking a seat behind you, Bryan. Tell us
about yourself, Liam.

00:10:43.853 --> 00:10:58.088
LIAM: My name is Allison and I am a Horfleporf. I
drink a lot of nutterbeer. Probably too much. Am I

00:10:58.088 --> 00:11:01.614
sharing my special thing you told me about, I
don't know?

00:11:01.614 --> 00:11:03.883
LAURA: No, you probably shouldn't.

00:11:03.883 --> 00:11:05.271
LIAM: What? No?

00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:06.631
LAURA: No, don't share it yet.

00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:07.643
LIAM: What?

00:11:07.643 --> 00:11:09.251
LAURA: Don't share it yet.

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:13.437
LIAM: All right. I don't know any of you. I don't
care to.

00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:16.446
TRAVIS: (tongue clucking)

00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:22.731
SAM: Do you have a boyfriend?

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.149
LAURA: As you stare at each other, suddenly--

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:26.348
SAM: Weird.

00:11:26.348 --> 00:11:34.148
LAURA: The door at the top of your Defense class,
you know belonging to Professor Furbin, slams

00:11:34.148 --> 00:11:45.886
open. Whatever. She walks out upon the stoop and
says, "Well, well, well. Here we are. I feel I

00:11:45.941 --> 00:11:51.389
"must congratulate you all for being on time. And
to thank you for allowing me to spend my day here

00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:57.338
"with you instead of celebrating a day off. Yes,
Claire?"

00:11:57.338 --> 00:12:03.495
SAM: I don't think I should be here. There's been
some sort of mistake. These are all fuckups and

00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:10.715
weirdos and I should not be part of this little
selection of riffraff. If you'd like my mother can

00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:16.158
call-- what are you-- get out of my personal
space.

00:12:16.466 --> 00:12:25.007
LAURA: "The time is approximately 7:06, that means
you have exactly two hours and 54 minutes left to

00:12:25.007 --> 00:12:26.243
"ponder why you're here--"

00:12:26.243 --> 00:12:27.719
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:33.860
LAURA: "-- to think about-- Bunder. Would you like
another detention? You're familiar with this classroom?"

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.256
TRAVIS: Yeah. I am. Sure. I want another.

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.788
LAURA: "Well, there you go. Next Saturday, you're
here with me again."

00:12:39.788 --> 00:12:42.402
TRAVIS: Great. Let's make it two!

00:12:42.402 --> 00:12:44.400
LAURA: "It already is two. Do you want three?"

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.807
TRAVIS: Bring it on.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.403
LAURA: "Three it is, keep going."

00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:48.907
TRAVIS: Perfect.

00:12:48.907 --> 00:12:53.295
LAURA: "Four it is, give me a full month, Bunder.
Are you done?"

00:12:53.295 --> 00:12:54.637
BRIAN: Give her a full month, Bunder.

00:12:54.683 --> 00:12:56.213
TRAVIS: No!

00:12:56.365 --> 00:13:08.786
LAURA: "Quiet, Bryan. There will be no speaking.
There will be no moving from your seats. In fact,

00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:14.829
"I'm going to give you all an assignment." She
begins walking around passing out pieces of

00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:21.434
parchment and quills. "I want you all to write me
an essay, at least a thousand words, telling me

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:29.591
"who you think you are. When I say essay, I mean
essay. Don't just write the same word over and

00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:37.541
"over and--" As she's speaking, there is a small
tap at the door. "Oh, for heaven's sake!" She

00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:42.907
walks to the black of the classroom-- the back of
the classroom, opens up the door, you see her

00:13:42.907 --> 00:13:49.211
speaking to somebody in hushed tones. "One moment,
do not get up!" She steps out of the classroom and

00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.980
shuts the door.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:57.651
SAM: Well, I don't know about you all, but we have
some essays to write, so I'm going to get right

00:13:57.651 --> 00:14:00.721
down to it.

00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:03.038
BRIAN: I already finished mine.

00:14:03.038 --> 00:14:07.058
SAM: What? That's impossible. You haven't moved
from your seat.

00:14:07.058 --> 00:14:12.658
TALIESIN: You finished yours? Then you can do mine
then. That's great. Here. Get right on that. That

00:14:12.658 --> 00:14:13.888
would be fine.

00:14:13.888 --> 00:14:17.389
BRIAN: How much quid you got?

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:23.365
TALIESIN: I've got five quid, which is just enough
for me to not kick your ass.

00:14:23.365 --> 00:14:24.647
BRIAN: Five quid'll do it!

00:14:24.647 --> 00:14:26.636
TALIESIN: All right.

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:30.384
LAURA: The door opens back up. Professor-- what
did I say, Furbin?

00:14:30.384 --> 00:14:33.121
TRAVIS: Yep, Furbin. I should write that down.

00:14:33.121 --> 00:14:34.434
LAURA: -- walks back in.

00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:35.562
SAM: Durbin.

00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:44.689
LAURA: Professor Durbin Durr! Walks back in. "I'm
afraid there has been an emergency situation. I

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:52.094
"have to leave the classroom for a few, hopefully,
minutes. You are not to leave this classroom.

00:14:52.094 --> 00:14:58.536
"Finish your assignment. Do as you're told. I have
ways of knowing what is going on in here.

00:14:58.536 --> 00:14:59.845
"Are we understood?"

00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:04.760
BRIAN: What's the emergency? Did you find the cat
that attacked him?

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:13.387
LAURA: "That is none of your business. And you,
Bryan, will be here next Saturday as well, serving

00:15:13.387 --> 00:15:15.144
"another detention."

00:15:15.144 --> 00:15:16.631
BRIAN: Ugh. Fuck's sake.

00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:21.424
LAURA: "If any of you leave this room, you'll be
serving with him as well. Two months! Two months

00:15:21.424 --> 00:15:24.176
"detention for leaving this classroom. Are we
understood?"

00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:29.293
SAM: Has my mother called yet? Because I'm pretty
sure she wants me to come home. I have to prepare

00:15:29.293 --> 00:15:30.458
my room for--

00:15:30.458 --> 00:15:31.754
TRAVIS: (mocking) My room for--

00:15:31.754 --> 00:15:37.157
SAM: -- for a very important family gathering next
weekend. And she would not be pleased to know that I am--

00:15:37.157 --> 00:15:39.579
TRAVIS: (mocking continues)

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:41.766
SAM: I don't sound anything like that.

00:15:41.766 --> 00:15:53.252
LAURA: "Quiet! Behave yourselves. You are young
adults," and she leaves the classroom.

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:57.326
Oh, what do you do?

00:15:57.326 --> 00:16:02.078
TRAVIS: I cast Fireball. No. Nope.

00:16:02.464 --> 00:16:05.702
LAURA: Her office is at the top of the stairs. The
door's at the back of the classroom. You have

00:16:05.702 --> 00:16:09.963
shelves along the walls with all of the books that
you're used to.

00:16:09.963 --> 00:16:11.980
SAM: The Defense Against the Dark Farts classroom?

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.879
LAURA: Yes, it is.

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:16.303
SAM: Are there any lockers or cubbies or things
around?

00:16:16.303 --> 00:16:18.898
LAURA: There's cubbies. You've been in this
classroom for years, though. You know exactly

00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:21.671
where everything is, shy of her office.

00:16:21.745 --> 00:16:25.294
TALIESIN: Are there locks on the door?

00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:26.720
LAURA: Locks on the doors?

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.052
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:16:28.052 --> 00:16:29.487
LAURA: You can try.

00:16:29.487 --> 00:16:33.329
TALIESIN: I'm going to just use some
Prestidigitation to see if the door can lock or

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:34.843
unlock from here.

00:16:34.843 --> 00:16:37.782
LAURA: Which one? The classroom door?

00:16:37.782 --> 00:16:38.913
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:16:38.913 --> 00:16:40.130
LAURA: All right.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.612
TALIESIN: So I'm just going to see if there's a
locking mechanism.

00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:51.022
LAURA: It seems like the school is used to
students trying to fuck around with things and

00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:53.415
maybe it's not letting you do it.

00:16:53.415 --> 00:16:59.627
TRAVIS: Hey, Sporto. That seems like an illegal
activity for someone of your repute. Aren't you

00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:02.117
worried that you're going to damage your ride?

00:17:02.117 --> 00:17:05.497
TALIESIN: No. I was just going to tell them you
did it.

00:17:05.497 --> 00:17:11.319
TRAVIS: Tell them-- But I like where your mind's
at. For me, I don't plan on staying in here the

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.313
whole time.

00:17:13.313 --> 00:17:16.093
BRIAN: How are you going to get out?

00:17:16.093 --> 00:17:22.078
TRAVIS: I see nothing but options in front of us.
We all got these, don't we? Don't we?

00:17:22.078 --> 00:17:25.745
BRIAN: Mine's a bit bigger than yours is. Fancy
that.

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:36.787
TRAVIS: Let me do a little Detect. I detect limp
noodle, core of wuss, pliant.

00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:45.709
BRIAN: Do you know what you also detect?
University. Something you'll never know about.

00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:48.092
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll fuck you up in two seconds.

00:17:48.092 --> 00:17:53.238
LIAM: Allison's not paying attention and she's
making ivy grow out of her desk and around the

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:59.407
chair and some mushrooms up each leg of the desk's
table legs.

00:17:59.407 --> 00:18:03.932
SAM: If the teacher comes back and catches you
doing that, she's going to give you detention again.

00:18:03.932 --> 00:18:06.495
LIAM: You'd have to tell her first.

00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:10.371
SAM: I'm not going to tell her, but if she asks, I
will have to answer truthfully.

00:18:10.371 --> 00:18:12.447
LIAM: Oops. Mushrooms up the front of your blouse.

00:18:12.447 --> 00:18:13.311
SAM: Oh, get the--

00:18:13.311 --> 00:18:14.946
LAURA: Roll a perception check, all of you.

00:18:14.946 --> 00:18:15.708
TRAVIS: Perception check.

00:18:15.708 --> 00:18:17.649
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.618
LIAM: Natural one.

00:18:21.618 --> 00:18:22.734
TALIESIN: 15.

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.143
LAURA: Well, you're busy making vines, aren't you?
15.

00:18:25.143 --> 00:18:26.352
SAM: 16.

00:18:26.352 --> 00:18:27.681
TRAVIS: Three.

00:18:27.681 --> 00:18:29.156
BRIAN: 11.

00:18:29.156 --> 00:18:36.240
LAURA: Okay. Claire and Andy, sitting closest to
her office, actually that makes sense, both of you

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:46.792
hear very faint, almost sounds like a small
child. Is it screaming? Maybe calling for help.

00:18:46.857 --> 00:18:52.253
SAM: From the office? Do you hear that?

00:18:52.253 --> 00:18:58.747
TALIESIN: Yeah, I do. I mean, it would be
irresponsible not to go check and see if someone's

00:18:58.747 --> 00:19:00.048
in trouble, right?

00:19:00.048 --> 00:19:02.846
SAM: We were told to stay in this room, though,
and that's what we should do.

00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:05.169
TALIESIN: If the room was on fire, we obviously
would have to leave.

00:19:05.169 --> 00:19:07.064
SAM: Yes, but it's not on fire.

00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:09.493
TALIESIN: That room could be on fire. Someone's
yelling.

00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:12.893
TRAVIS: You always do what you're told, Claire?
Always? Miss Perfect?

00:19:12.893 --> 00:19:20.501
SAM: No, I'm not perfect. I just see no reason to
break the rules, and I'm not going to until--

00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:23.891
TRAVIS: (snores) I'm with you, Andy. Let's do it.

00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:25.336
TALIESIN: All right. I dare you to go first.

00:19:25.336 --> 00:19:31.207
TRAVIS: I dare you to-- Okay. What am I doing?

00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:32.694
TALIESIN: Go check on the door. Get up.

00:19:32.694 --> 00:19:33.473
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah.

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:39.278
SAM: There's a screaming child in there. It's
probably related to you because you're such a

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:40.777
fucking baby over there.

00:19:40.777 --> 00:19:44.016
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry)

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.316
SAM: Ooh. Multi-language flip-off.

00:19:47.316 --> 00:19:49.332
TRAVIS: Can I go up to the door?

00:19:49.332 --> 00:19:50.719
LAURA: Yeah.

00:19:50.719 --> 00:19:52.278
TRAVIS: Is it locked?

00:19:52.278 --> 00:19:53.725
LAURA: It's not locked.

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:54.700
TRAVIS: It's not locked?

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.883
LAURA: Mm-mm.

00:19:55.883 --> 00:19:58.160
TALIESIN: Okay, I get up. Now that I see it's not
locked, I'll get up too.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.720
SAM: You shouldn't get up at all.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.982
TALIESIN: Shh.

00:20:00.982 --> 00:20:02.272
TRAVIS: Shut up.

00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:03.284
TALIESIN: Help or don't.

00:20:03.284 --> 00:20:05.392
TRAVIS: Probably not trapped, right? I mean, we're
in a school.

00:20:05.392 --> 00:20:08.838
TALIESIN: I'll--

00:20:08.838 --> 00:20:12.643
TRAVIS: I got it. I'll just open the door.

00:20:12.643 --> 00:20:13.968
LAURA: It's not trapped.

00:20:13.968 --> 00:20:15.976
TRAVIS: Oh, nice. Can I just open it?

00:20:15.976 --> 00:20:20.512
LAURA: Yeah. Bunder, you're actually really
familiar with this room, having served so many

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:27.370
detentions, a lot of them one-on-one with the
professor. So this is the office you're used to.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:32.181
Everything's where you were used to seeing it.
Actually, let me bring in a map.

00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:33.335
SAM: You got a map?

00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:34.382
TRAVIS: Oh! A map already?!

00:20:34.382 --> 00:20:35.271
SAM: It's a first encounter.

00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:36.618
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:20:36.618 --> 00:20:38.587
SAM: Laura Bailey.

00:20:38.587 --> 00:20:41.543
LAURA: Oh, here's your classroom!

00:20:41.543 --> 00:20:44.891
ALL: Ooh!

00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:50.555
LAURA: All right. So this is where you are. Claire
and Andy, Bryan--

00:20:50.555 --> 00:20:52.160
LIAM: She got it from Chessex.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.427
LAURA: I did. Bryan, Allison--

00:20:55.427 --> 00:20:56.743
TRAVIS: That's probably dry-erase marker.

00:20:56.743 --> 00:21:02.382
LAURA: Yeah, totally not Sharpie. Here's you,
Bunder, you're back here. I can put you where

00:21:02.382 --> 00:21:03.831
you're at.

00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:04.965
TRAVIS: Oh, we have us-es?

00:21:04.965 --> 00:21:13.004
LAURA: No, but I'll use some of these figures over
here like Sam did. Okay. So this is Allison. This

00:21:13.004 --> 00:21:19.306
is Andy. This looks like Claire, because you've
got flippy hair.

00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:20.461
SAM: Sure.

00:21:20.461 --> 00:21:24.631
LAURA: Oh, this is perfect because this is a
Smytherpin! This will be Bunder. Then this one

00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:34.682
right here is-- Well, you're a girl. We'll switch
this. This is Ally, this is Bryan.

00:21:34.682 --> 00:21:35.732
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:21:35.732 --> 00:21:41.116
LAURA: You have walked up here, Bunder.

00:21:41.116 --> 00:21:42.301
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.602
TALIESIN: I've joined.

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:44.294
LAURA: Andy.

00:21:44.294 --> 00:21:45.218
LIAM: I'm going, too.

00:21:45.218 --> 00:21:46.723
LAURA: You go join at the top of the door and you
walk through.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.671
SAM: Allison said she's going too, but she mumbled
it.

00:21:49.671 --> 00:21:53.554
LIAM: It's boring down here.

00:21:53.554 --> 00:21:59.482
TRAVIS: Are any of the portraits on the wall, are
they paying attention to me as I walk up the stairs?

00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:04.444
LAURA: There's actually no portraits on the wall
here. But, what you're used to seeing in her room,

00:22:04.714 --> 00:22:10.019
are three large tapestries covering the walls. On
the one on the back, you see a giant tapestry,

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:16.416
like you're used to, of a green dragon sleeping on
top of a hoard of gold. The way it's woven, you

00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:23.877
can almost see curls of smoke coming up from his
nose. On the left wall, is a phoenix rising from a

00:22:23.877 --> 00:22:32.581
big mound of ashes. It looks like the fire is
actually glowing in the weave. On the right wall,

00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:39.695
you see a tapestry featuring a herd of centaurs.
Is that what you call them? A group of them? I

00:22:39.695 --> 00:22:46.854
don't know. Galloping over a hill with tall blades
of grass almost blowing in the breeze. It seems to

00:22:46.854 --> 00:22:55.073
move as you look at it. What you're not used to
seeing, however, is in the corner, a little-- it

00:22:55.073 --> 00:23:05.276
almost looks like a birdcage filled with little
sprites? Pixies? You're not sure. "(gasp) You

00:23:05.276 --> 00:23:08.699
"heard me. You heard me! Help, please!"

00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:13.745
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Andy, look in the corner.

00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:15.934
TALIESIN: Are they in detention too?

00:23:15.934 --> 00:23:19.394
LAURA: "You have to let us out of here. I don't
even know what she's doing!"

00:23:19.394 --> 00:23:23.824
TRAVIS: Shh! Keep your voice down. Who's she?

00:23:23.824 --> 00:23:25.411
LAURA: "The professor?"

00:23:25.411 --> 00:23:26.694
TRAVIS: Professor Furbin?

00:23:26.694 --> 00:23:34.354
LAURA: "Yeah. She's obsessed! She stole us from
our home in the forest behind the castle. Please.

00:23:34.354 --> 00:23:37.996
"We just want to get back to our families."

00:23:39.358 --> 00:23:40.747
SAM: What's going on up there?

00:23:40.747 --> 00:23:41.733
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Nothing!

00:23:41.733 --> 00:23:42.951
BRIAN: What's happening?

00:23:42.951 --> 00:23:44.879
TRAVIS: There's a mirror and it just talks.

00:23:44.879 --> 00:23:47.295
TALIESIN: Keep watch.

00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:51.823
TRAVIS: Yeah, so how many of these little sprites
are in the cage?

00:23:51.823 --> 00:23:57.036
LAURA: It looks like about eight of them. Are you
walking into the room?

00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:58.964
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:23:59.663 --> 00:24:05.412
LAURA: As you walk in closer, you can see better
now that instead of a normal fairy, they almost

00:24:05.412 --> 00:24:16.031
look like there are two arms on top, two arms on
bottom and each of the fairies have eight-- four legs.

00:24:16.031 --> 00:24:17.466
That's how it would go.

00:24:17.466 --> 00:24:18.670
TRAVIS: Four arms, four legs?

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:24.677
LAURA: Four arms and four legs. They have humanoid
features, but closer it's almost like a tarantula,

00:24:24.677 --> 00:24:27.644
they've got a fur covering their bodies.

00:24:27.644 --> 00:24:30.156
TRAVIS: Do they have (clicking) pincers?

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:31.849
LAURA: They're pretty small, you can't really
see.

00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:33.499
TRAVIS: What color are they?

00:24:33.499 --> 00:24:39.576
LAURA: They're almost a black color. Beautiful
wings, dragonfly-like wings.

00:24:39.576 --> 00:24:41.270
LIAM: Are they winged?

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.479
LAURA: They are, but they're sitting. They're not
flying in there right now, they're sitting very sadly.

00:24:45.479 --> 00:24:46.955
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll keep an eye, you get him.

00:24:46.955 --> 00:24:48.128
TALIESIN: Nerd!

00:24:48.128 --> 00:24:49.477
BRIAN: What?

00:24:49.477 --> 00:24:51.017
TALIESIN: We need you to take a look at
something.

00:24:51.017 --> 00:24:53.449
BRIAN: I'll come up there when I'm good and
ready.

00:24:53.449 --> 00:24:54.866
TALIESIN: Coming up right now.

00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:56.518
BRIAN: Coming up right now.

00:24:56.518 --> 00:24:58.839
SAM: I can't be the only one down-- (huffs)

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:00.597
BRIAN: No, it's fine, just-- Yeah.

00:25:00.597 --> 00:25:03.569
TRAVIS: Yeah careful, Claire. There's all sorts of
exciting things in here.

00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:07.487
SAM: I'm going to stay down here until--

00:25:07.487 --> 00:25:10.609
BRIAN: She just wants to not get in trouble. She
won't get caught.

00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:12.344
LAURA: I'm going to take my necklace off because
it's hitting things.

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:15.180
BRIAN: What you need?

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.102
TALIESIN: You ever seen anything like this before?
Do you know what these are?

00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:21.351
BRIAN: Oh that's an eight-pack of sprites right
there.

00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:25.436
(laughter)

00:25:25.436 --> 00:25:26.277
LIAM: (Australian accent) Bacon and eggs!

00:25:26.277 --> 00:25:27.261
TRAVIS: (Australian accent) Down under.

00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:30.092
LIAM: (Australian accent) Fairies on the barbie.

00:25:30.092 --> 00:25:34.865
LAURA: "Please! Why are you laughing? You have to
help us."

00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:37.725
BRIAN: What's the matter, you were kidnapped?

00:25:37.725 --> 00:25:38.693
LAURA: "Yes!"

00:25:38.693 --> 00:25:40.095
BRIAN: By who?

00:25:40.095 --> 00:25:44.296
LAURA: "By this woman! This small woman!"

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:45.310
BRIAN: Which woman?

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:50.170
LAURA: "Please! We were brought here. The
professor says she wants to learn about us. I

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.654
"don't know what that means!"

00:25:51.798 --> 00:25:58.264
TRAVIS: While they're pleading, is there anything
on the desk that looks like it might be worth snagging?

00:25:58.264 --> 00:26:05.566
LAURA: There's a neat stack of books on the desk.
Everything else-- she's a very clean professor.

00:26:05.566 --> 00:26:07.262
BRIAN: Is this where the birdcage is?

00:26:07.262 --> 00:26:11.606
LAURA; No, the birdcage is in the corner, it's a
bigger-- it's a square, like an intricate, square,

00:26:11.606 --> 00:26:13.881
big birdcage.

00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:20.252
TRAVIS: I don't know. What's in it for us if we
let you out? I'll start trying the drawers of the

00:26:20.252 --> 00:26:23.055
desk to see if they open.

00:26:23.055 --> 00:26:26.089
LIAM: Are there any beverages in here?

00:26:26.089 --> 00:26:28.144
LAURA: There's no beverages.

00:26:28.144 --> 00:26:29.590
LIAM: No decanters, no?

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.972
LAURA: No, nothing.

00:26:30.972 --> 00:26:34.012
BRIAN: Have they done anything to you in here?

00:26:34.012 --> 00:26:37.773
LAURA: "They took one of our friends. I haven't
seen her since."

00:26:37.773 --> 00:26:39.494
BRIAN: Do you know where she went?

00:26:39.494 --> 00:26:40.792
LAURA: "No."

00:26:40.792 --> 00:26:42.128
BRIAN: How long ago?

00:26:42.128 --> 00:26:45.089
LAURA: "I don't know, it's hard to tell time in
here. Please!"

00:26:45.089 --> 00:26:46.449
LIAM: Have you been hurt at all?

00:26:46.449 --> 00:26:52.718
LAURA: "I haven't, but I miss my family so much.
Please! If you let us out I can tell you how to

00:26:52.718 --> 00:26:54.883
"open her desk."

00:26:54.883 --> 00:26:58.021
BRIAN: (noncommittal mumbling)

00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:01.058
TRAVIS: Sounds solid to me. Yeah!

00:27:01.058 --> 00:27:05.225
LIAM: Is it locked? Did you try it?

00:27:05.225 --> 00:27:06.943
TRAVIS: No. Is it locked?

00:27:06.943 --> 00:27:07.772
LAURA: The desk?

00:27:07.772 --> 00:27:09.681
TRAVIS: No, the cage.

00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:11.972
LAURA: The cage has a small lock on it, yes.

00:27:11.972 --> 00:27:16.558
TRAVIS: Anybody good with locks? Oh, I think I
am!

00:27:16.558 --> 00:27:17.736
LAURA: "I know where the key is!"

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:18.758
TRAVIS: Oh. And where is that?

00:27:18.758 --> 00:27:22.086
LAURA: "It's in the drawer. On the left-hand side
of her desk."

00:27:22.086 --> 00:27:24.083
TRAVIS: Allison?

00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:27.253
LIAM: All right. I go to the desk.

00:27:27.253 --> 00:27:32.230
LAURA: Okay. You look at the desk. There's three
drawers in the left-hand side and the middle is

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.807
more intricate-looking. It looks like the middle
drawer is the one that's locked, that she was

00:27:36.807 --> 00:27:39.994
talking about, but you can open the left drawer if
you want to.

00:27:39.994 --> 00:27:41.457
LIAM: I'll start on the left at the top.

00:27:41.457 --> 00:27:42.708
LAURA: Okay, you open it.

00:27:42.708 --> 00:27:43.914
LIAM: Yes?

00:27:43.914 --> 00:27:46.975
LAURA: Sitting in there, you see a small key that
looks like it would fit in the birdcage.

00:27:46.975 --> 00:27:50.722
LIAM: You do it.

00:27:50.722 --> 00:27:55.355
TRAVIS: You do it.

00:27:55.355 --> 00:27:58.271
TALIESIN: Together, no? More deniability?

00:27:58.271 --> 00:28:00.686
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:28:00.686 --> 00:28:02.469
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: One, two, three.

00:28:02.469 --> 00:28:05.114
TRAVIS: Oh you prick.

00:28:05.114 --> 00:28:09.954
LAURA: As you open it, the fucking sprites go
fucking crazy. They just come out into the room. I

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:11.239
want everybody to roll initiative.

00:28:11.239 --> 00:28:12.854
ALL: Oh!

00:28:12.854 --> 00:28:14.143
SAM: Initiative?!

00:28:14.143 --> 00:28:16.142
TRAVIS: Fucking sprites.

00:28:16.142 --> 00:28:17.611
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:21.377
LAURA: Let me find my little dice, because I don't
have actual sprites, but I have these little dice

00:28:21.377 --> 00:28:24.402
that I'm going to use to show where they are.

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:25.454
LIAM: Itty-bitties?

00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:27.360
LAURA: Itty-bitty dice.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.471
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's terrible.

00:28:29.471 --> 00:28:33.472
LAURA: How many do I have? How many did I say?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Then

00:28:33.472 --> 00:28:40.262
we'll use this teeny-- Oh they're so teeny. So
they fly out. One goes over here. One comes over

00:28:40.262 --> 00:28:48.091
to the corner. One comes up on the desk. Two fly
out the window, out the door. One flies over to--

00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:49.679
who is this one?

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.473
LIAM and SAM: Allison.

00:28:50.473 --> 00:28:58.412
LAURA: Allison! One flies over to Andy and one
comes at you, Bunder.

00:28:58.412 --> 00:29:00.722
TRAVIS: Bunder!

00:29:00.722 --> 00:29:02.846
LAURA: Hold on, let me roll initiative, too.

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:03.975
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:29:04.556 --> 00:29:09.083
LAURA: Okay. I have no idea how this works.

00:29:09.083 --> 00:29:10.135
TRAVIS: 25 to 20.

00:29:10.135 --> 00:29:11.956
LAURA: 25 to 20!

00:29:11.956 --> 00:29:13.136
LIAM: 20.

00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:14.139
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:29:14.139 --> 00:29:18.886
LAURA: Okay. 20 to 15?

00:29:20.146 --> 00:29:20.800
LIAM: Oh dear.

00:29:21.013 --> 00:29:22.124
TALIESIN: Crickets.

00:29:22.124 --> 00:29:23.307
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:29:23.307 --> 00:29:27.836
LAURA: Oh wow. 15 to ten? Are you fucking kidding
me?

00:29:27.836 --> 00:29:29.019
TRAVIS: I rolled an eight.

00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:29.760
TALIESIN: Eight.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.589
SAM: I have a nine.

00:29:30.589 --> 00:29:31.352
BRIAN: <i>Nein</i>!

00:29:31.352 --> 00:29:32.729
TRAVIS: Two nines and two eights?

00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:34.165
LAURA: Two nines? Okay, Bryan.

00:29:34.165 --> 00:29:35.504
TRAVIS: Bryan and Claire.

00:29:35.504 --> 00:29:36.791
TALIESIN: We are sharp, aren't we?

00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:38.673
LAURA: And then Bunder.

00:29:39.589 --> 00:29:40.815
TRAVIS: And Andy.

00:29:40.815 --> 00:29:48.633
LAURA: Bunder and Andy. All right. Let me look at
this sheet and figure out when they go. (singing

00:29:48.633 --> 00:29:52.695
to herself)

00:29:52.695 --> 00:29:57.075
SAM: Laura Bailey is about to operate combat.
Multiple--

00:29:57.075 --> 00:30:00.825
LAURA: I mean, look at how many fucking things I
put out here. I have no idea why I did this.

00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:02.486
SAM: This was my first mistake, too.

00:30:02.486 --> 00:30:04.382
TRAVIS: Yeah, you put eight enemies in that
tavern.

00:30:04.382 --> 00:30:07.133
LIAM: You had 500 people down.

00:30:07.133 --> 00:30:12.490
LAURA: That's okay, these are little guys. Do you
really want to kill them? I mean, come on!

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.902
LIAM: Kind of.

00:30:16.504 --> 00:30:18.368
TRAVIS: I've got spells. Spells.

00:30:18.368 --> 00:30:22.586
LAURA: All right, Ally, you're up first. What
would you like to do?

00:30:22.586 --> 00:30:32.761
LIAM: I'm going to use a cantrip and I'm going to
make this wand grow into a full-sized staff and

00:30:32.761 --> 00:30:36.051
cast Shillelagh.

00:30:36.051 --> 00:30:40.633
TRAVIS and SAM: (exaggerated) Shillelagh!

00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:46.727
LIAM: That's a bonus action, actually. So now I'm
holding it. Can I hold my action to attack this

00:30:46.727 --> 00:30:48.799
thing if it attacks me?

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:49.669
LAURA: Yes.

00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:50.826
LIAM: That's what I'm going to do.

00:30:50.826 --> 00:30:59.971
LAURA: Okay. Up next are the biting sprites. The
one next to you is going to bite you.

00:30:59.971 --> 00:31:13.924
LIAM: Whack! Okay, so I would attack. Everything
is brand new. That is a very terrible roll. That's six.

00:31:13.976 --> 00:31:16.953
LAURA: Yeah, that does <i>not</i> hit.

00:31:16.953 --> 00:31:18.258
LIAM: No.

00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:23.157
LAURA: That definitely doesn't hit. And that's it,
right?

00:31:23.157 --> 00:31:24.422
LIAM: That's all I've got.

00:31:24.422 --> 00:31:30.559
LAURA: That's all you can do. Okay, they're going
to bite you. She's going to roll. Oh my god, this

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:34.535
is terrifying! Oh my god, I rolled a 19. That
definitely hits.

00:31:34.535 --> 00:31:36.201
LIAM: That definitely hits.

00:31:36.201 --> 00:31:46.748
LAURA: That is a 1d8. Okay, that's good. That's a
three. You take three biting damage and then you

00:31:46.748 --> 00:31:48.654
have to make a constitution save.

00:31:48.654 --> 00:31:55.513
LIAM: All right. That's pretty good. Where is
everything? That is an 18.

00:31:55.513 --> 00:32:08.819
LAURA: Oh, good! You saved. So you only take five
points of poison damage. Okay, the next one! This

00:32:08.819 --> 00:32:16.680
one's going to just dance around on the desk and
take a piss. This one is going to attack Andy with

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.205
a multi-attack. They're going to do a dagger
attack on you.

00:32:22.205 --> 00:32:24.483
SAM: They have daggers?!

00:32:24.483 --> 00:32:30.432
LAURA: They have little daggers. Tiny little
toothpicks, but they are really fucking fast.

00:32:30.432 --> 00:32:32.406
She's going to make three dagger attacks.

00:32:32.406 --> 00:32:35.447
ALL: Whoa!

00:32:35.447 --> 00:32:37.074
SAM: I don't like this DM!

00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:46.597
LAURA: (laughs maniacally) The first two are, oh
jeez, 12?

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:48.235
TALIESIN: That's my armor class.

00:32:48.235 --> 00:32:51.654
LAURA: Okay, the second one is 11, that doesn't
hit. The third one is a 14, so it does.

00:32:51.654 --> 00:32:53.120
TALIESIN: Two attacks, yep.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:33:07.854
LAURA: Where's my eight? Here it is. Ooh, that's
cocked.

00:33:07.854 --> 00:33:10.255
LIAM: I'm entranced with this acorn hat on Laura's
head.

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:11.166
LAURA: It's really great, isn't it?

00:33:11.166 --> 00:33:12.422
LIAM and TRAVIS: It's pretty cute.

00:33:12.422 --> 00:33:15.948
LAURA: Ten on the first dagger. Oh, damn.

00:33:15.948 --> 00:33:17.337
TALIESIN: Damn!

00:33:17.337 --> 00:33:18.845
LAURA: Only two points on the second one.

00:33:18.845 --> 00:33:20.436
LIAM: TPK in under ten minutes.

00:33:20.436 --> 00:33:21.421
TRAVIS: Come on, man!

00:33:21.421 --> 00:33:26.111
LAURA: Oh my god, right?! Okay, so that's that
one.

00:33:26.111 --> 00:33:29.461
TRAVIS: Bumblesnore is going to do a funeral for
one of us real quick.

00:33:29.461 --> 00:33:36.063
LAURA: The third one is standing on the plant in
the corner. That's what this is. That's the fourth

00:33:36.063 --> 00:33:42.157
one. I don't know what she's doing. The fifth one
is attacking you, Bunder. She's going to bite at you.

00:33:42.157 --> 00:33:46.763
TRAVIS: Bring it! Bet you won't roll high enough,
punk! (blows raspberry)

00:33:46.763 --> 00:33:49.607
LAURA: Oh, I don't think it did with a natural
one.

00:33:49.607 --> 00:33:51.104
TRAVIS: No!

00:33:51.104 --> 00:33:55.547
LAURA: It's a nothing! She goes to bite you, but
she's just in awe of your earring and bites that

00:33:55.547 --> 00:33:57.481
instead and licks it a little bit.

00:33:57.481 --> 00:33:59.698
TRAVIS: Yeah, you would.

00:33:59.698 --> 00:34:05.704
LAURA: The next one goes after-- oh, they both
flew out of the classroom. They just fly out and

00:34:05.704 --> 00:34:12.287
they're flying around the classroom. They start
flying over here and knocking a bunch of books off

00:34:12.287 --> 00:34:21.686
the bookshelf and ripping things apart. Next up is
who on the initiative?

00:34:21.686 --> 00:34:23.428
TRAVIS: They were after Allison?

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:28.261
LAURA: Yeah. Brian, you're up next.

00:34:28.261 --> 00:34:32.421
BRIAN: These are the only two in the room? Or
there's one attacking you here?

00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:33.472
TALIESIN: There's one on me.

00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:34.535
TRAVIS: There's four.

00:34:34.535 --> 00:34:38.226
BRIAN: Oh, yeah. Okay, sorry. They're blending
into the environment.

00:34:38.226 --> 00:34:39.714
LAURA: They're teeny.

00:34:39.714 --> 00:34:41.289
TRAVIS: It's a detailed map.

00:34:41.289 --> 00:34:42.940
BRIAN: How much movement do I have?

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.690
LAURA: Hey!

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.491
TRAVIS: It's good, though!

00:34:44.491 --> 00:34:47.116
BRIAN: I will go over here and attack this one.

00:34:47.116 --> 00:34:49.582
LIAM: It doesn't look like a dick and balls at
all, though.

00:34:49.582 --> 00:34:51.611
BRIAN: I'd like to go over here--

00:34:51.611 --> 00:34:52.703
LAURA: And attack that plant?

00:34:52.703 --> 00:34:55.201
BRIAN: Yeah, I'm going to do Sacred Flame.

00:34:55.201 --> 00:34:56.922
LAURA: Oh, nice.

00:34:56.922 --> 00:34:58.485
SAM: (sarcastic English accent) Sacred Flame?

00:34:58.485 --> 00:35:00.516
BRIAN: Sacred Flame in his ass!

00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:01.773
LAURA: All right.

00:35:01.773 --> 00:35:03.346
BRIAN: Or her ass.

00:35:03.346 --> 00:35:05.427
LAURA: What is that? Tell me how Sacred Flame
works.

00:35:05.427 --> 00:35:09.412
BRIAN: "A flame-like radiance descends on a
creature you can see within range. The target must

00:35:09.412 --> 00:35:15.838
"success on a dexterity saving throw 16 or take 2d8
radiant damage."

00:35:15.838 --> 00:35:20.565
LAURA: Okay, let's find out. Definitely a success,
that is 16 plus six. They are very tiny. They're

00:35:20.565 --> 00:35:21.627
hard to hit.

00:35:21.627 --> 00:35:22.822
BRIAN: (buzzing)

00:35:22.822 --> 00:35:27.646
LAURA: But as you get over there-- this is you,
right, dweeb?

00:35:27.646 --> 00:35:28.676
BRIAN: That's me.

00:35:28.676 --> 00:35:35.772
LAURA: As you get over there, the plant comes
alive. It's a violet fungus over in the corner.

00:35:35.772 --> 00:35:37.983
TRAVIS: (shouting) Oh! Dang!

00:35:37.983 --> 00:35:44.142
LAURA: Oh my god! I can't believe you fell for
that shit! It's going to make an attack against

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:49.259
you. That definitely hits with a natural 18.

00:35:49.259 --> 00:35:50.611
BRIAN: Yep.

00:35:50.611 --> 00:36:03.880
LAURA: It's going to do 1d4 Rotting Touch. That's
just four, no, two points of damage. All right. Up

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.847
next is Claire.

00:36:08.847 --> 00:36:12.831
SAM: What is happening up there?

00:36:12.831 --> 00:36:14.847
TRAVIS: You're so hot, babe.

00:36:14.847 --> 00:36:20.233
SAM: I'm going to stand up at the desk and say to
those two sprites down there: Those books are for

00:36:20.233 --> 00:36:29.667
students only! I will cast Magic Missile, sending
two darts at one of them and one dart at the

00:36:29.667 --> 00:36:32.511
other. They instantly hit!

00:36:32.511 --> 00:36:33.706
LAURA: Oh, they do?

00:36:33.706 --> 00:36:41.908
SAM: They do. They cause two points of damage
each. One takes four damage and the other takes two.

00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:45.941
LAURA: All right. They're still alive.

00:36:45.941 --> 00:36:59.129
SAM: Uh-huh. Then I'll move towards them, but turn
to the right so I can hide behind the stairs or something.

00:36:59.129 --> 00:37:00.108
LAURA: How about that?

00:37:00.108 --> 00:37:01.102
SAM: That's perfect.

00:37:01.102 --> 00:37:06.359
LAURA: Okay! Up next is Bunder. What do you want
to do, Bunder?

00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:12.622
TRAVIS: I am going to turn to this little sprite
right here next to me and I'm going to cast Ray Of

00:37:12.622 --> 00:37:20.173
Frost. Yeah. "A frigid beam of blue-white light
streaks toward a creature within range. Make a

00:37:20.173 --> 00:37:23.990
"ranged spell attack against the target."

00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:26.538
LAURA: Which one are you hitting? The one that's
attacking you?

00:37:26.538 --> 00:37:31.635
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one. That is a 12.

00:37:31.635 --> 00:37:32.887
LAURA: That doesn't hit.

00:37:32.887 --> 00:37:36.064
TRAVIS: Fuck! I think that's my turn.

00:37:36.064 --> 00:37:40.153
SAM: Nice job.

00:37:40.153 --> 00:37:43.307
LAURA: All right, up next: that's Andy.

00:37:43.307 --> 00:37:47.708
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to
summon my beater stick.

00:37:47.708 --> 00:37:51.868
LAURA: (laughter) Nice.

00:37:51.868 --> 00:37:55.748
TALIESIN: It flies into my hand. I'm going to spin
around and try-- I live for this-- I'm going to

00:37:55.748 --> 00:38:06.476
try and hit the one that took a swing at me and
I'm going to strike with a green flame attack.

00:38:06.476 --> 00:38:12.235
TRAVIS: Ooh, you can make it green, too?

00:38:12.235 --> 00:38:16.080
TALIESIN: That's my specialty. (triumphant
laughter) 27 to hit.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.991
LAURA: Whoa yes, that definitely hits.

00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:30.045
TALIESIN: That's, oh wow, that's a lot. This is
going to hurt. That's a 1d4 and a 1d8. 13 points

00:38:30.045 --> 00:38:31.503
of damage.

00:38:31.503 --> 00:38:38.674
LAURA: That sprite is just obliterated. Little,
teeny flecks of blood splatter on the wall.

00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:42.949
TALIESIN: I'm going to flip around on top of the
desk and squish the one that is on the desk.

00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:45.769
LAURA: Awesome! Okay, you jump up there.

00:38:45.769 --> 00:38:51.522
TALIESIN: I am going to swing and squish that one.
That's a 16 to hit.

00:38:51.522 --> 00:38:53.062
LAURA: That hits!

00:38:53.062 --> 00:38:56.347
TALIESIN: That's not going to be quite as
hardcore, but it's seven points of damage.

00:38:56.347 --> 00:38:59.377
LAURA: Seven points of damage. It's hanging on,
but just barely.

00:38:59.377 --> 00:39:04.146
TALIESIN, SAM, and BRIAN: Ah!

00:39:04.146 --> 00:39:07.047
LAURA: All right, we're back up to the top with
Ally.

00:39:07.047 --> 00:39:11.521
LIAM: I will stay with the same strategy and I am
going to swing my shillelagh like a golf club and

00:39:11.521 --> 00:39:20.036
see if I can smear that one against the wall
closest to me. That's another a terrible roll.

00:39:20.036 --> 00:39:22.223
That is 13 to hit.

00:39:22.223 --> 00:39:23.227
LAURA: It doesn't hit.

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:26.293
LIAM: It doesn't hit. Swing away, swing wide. No.

00:39:26.293 --> 00:39:31.063
LAURA: It's laughing at you. It keeps darting out
of the way going (mischievous laughter). All

00:39:31.063 --> 00:39:40.583
right, that is the sprites' turns. Oh jesus, this
is a lot. The one next to you, Ally, is going to

00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:49.914
dagger at you. The first two do not hit, but the
third one does.

00:39:49.914 --> 00:39:51.271
LIAM: All right.

00:39:51.271 --> 00:39:54.297
LAURA: Then that is-- what did I say?

00:39:54.297 --> 00:39:55.792
SAM: You know.

00:39:55.792 --> 00:39:58.038
LAURA: It's just a little thing, the daggers.

00:39:58.038 --> 00:39:59.759
TALIESIN: Tiny daggers.

00:39:59.759 --> 00:40:07.090
LAURA: Oh god, it's a lot! Okay. Dupe, dupe and a
dupe. All right.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.010
SAM: That's three dupes.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.396
BRIAN: Three dupes until Christmas.

00:40:10.396 --> 00:40:16.178
LAURA: Oh, but only one hits. Never mind, I'm
going to roll again, only one hits. That is four

00:40:16.178 --> 00:40:18.544
points of piercing damage.

00:40:18.544 --> 00:40:20.601
LIAM: All right.

00:40:20.601 --> 00:40:24.535
ALL: (singing) Dupey, dupey, dupey, dupe.

00:40:24.535 --> 00:40:30.539
LAURA: The one on the desk is going to attack you,
Andy, for coming at her, with a bite.

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:33.494
SAM: He's a jock, though, he'll be fine.

00:40:33.494 --> 00:40:35.135
LAURA: 12 plus--

00:40:35.135 --> 00:40:36.396
SAM: Isn't he the jock? You're not the jock?

00:40:36.396 --> 00:40:37.249
TRAVIS: I'm the rebel, bitch!

00:40:37.249 --> 00:40:39.625
SAM: You're the rebel, you're the jock, you're the
nerd. You're the burnout?

00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:40.879
LAURA: 16.

00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:42.545
TALIESIN: That hits.

00:40:42.545 --> 00:40:52.244
LAURA: Okay. That's 1d8 plus two, so that's six
points of-- oh god, no! You have to make a

00:40:52.244 --> 00:40:53.992
constitution saving throw.

00:40:53.992 --> 00:40:56.413
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:58.019
TRAVIS: Smytherpin!

00:40:58.019 --> 00:41:01.265
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, 22.

00:41:01.265 --> 00:41:11.267
LAURA: Nice! That is five points of poison
damage. Oh! Halved, because you saved.

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:15.897
TALIESIN: So three points of-- yeah, okay.

00:41:15.897 --> 00:41:17.505
SAM: What house am I?

00:41:17.505 --> 00:41:18.801
BRIAN: Dryffingor!

00:41:18.801 --> 00:41:27.849
LAURA: You're a Dryffingor! The one in the corner
with you, Brian, is going to attack you with three daggers.

00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:29.503
BRIAN: Okay.

00:41:29.503 --> 00:41:31.437
SAM and LAURA: Dagger, dagger, dagger.

00:41:31.437 --> 00:41:37.887
LAURA: Oh, natural 20! The second one misses, I
think.

00:41:37.887 --> 00:41:39.963
SAM: She is killing us.

00:41:40.008 --> 00:41:41.374
LAURA: I know right? Sorry.

00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:44.256
LIAM: We're going to send you to Abzkadan.

00:41:44.256 --> 00:41:46.507
LAURA: Is it a ten, does that hit?

00:41:46.507 --> 00:41:49.413
BRIAN: That's my armor class.

00:41:50.117 --> 00:42:02.386
LAURA: The third one misses, you're lucky. That's
two daggers. (laughter) Okay, that's eight points

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:03.745
of piercing damage.

00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:06.290
BRIAN: Okay.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:14.406
LAURA: All right, you know what? I'm pretty
violent here. The next one down, it's just like

00:42:14.406 --> 00:42:18.796
hanging out in the corner. It's going to start
taking its daggers and destroying the tapestry of

00:42:18.796 --> 00:42:20.119
the centaurs.

00:42:20.119 --> 00:42:21.526
TRAVIS: Oh, not cool.

00:42:21.526 --> 00:42:26.091
LAURA: The ones over by the books. Claire, you
attacked them, why did you do that?

00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:31.705
SAM: Because they were stealing the property of
Schmogwarts.

00:42:31.705 --> 00:42:34.301
LAURA: One hisses at you, and the other one flies
at your face.

00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:36.350
SAM: No! My beautiful face.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:37.842
LAURA: She is going to try to bite your nose.

00:42:37.842 --> 00:42:38.785
SAM: No!

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:44.720
LAURA: Oh does a 13 hit?

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.822
SAM: Sure.

00:42:45.822 --> 00:42:49.872
LAURA: Awesome! Make a constitution saving throw.

00:42:51.424 --> 00:42:53.425
SAM: Six.

00:42:53.425 --> 00:42:55.743
LIAM: Did anyone at this table equip armor?

00:42:55.743 --> 00:42:57.917
SAM: No, we were not told to.

00:42:57.917 --> 00:43:01.256
TRAVIS: My AC's 12.

00:43:01.256 --> 00:43:03.750
SAM: Mine is ten, yours is ten.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.020
LIAM: I'm sitting at a 14.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.384
BRIAN: What do you go there, big piggy pants?

00:43:09.384 --> 00:43:10.985
TALIESIN: 12.

00:43:10.985 --> 00:43:15.966
LAURA: That's eight points of poison damage. Are
you all going to die before we get out of this room?

00:43:15.966 --> 00:43:17.790
SAM: Probably.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.509
TRAVIS: Y'all, we got this. We're fine.

00:43:20.509 --> 00:43:22.124
SAM: We got like tons of healers.

00:43:22.124 --> 00:43:23.794
LAURA: All right, Ally, you're up.

00:43:23.794 --> 00:43:26.657
LIAM: Already? It's already me? That was fast.

00:43:26.657 --> 00:43:31.052
LAURA: Oh, no, just kidding. Bryan you're up, the
faeries went.

00:43:31.052 --> 00:43:41.324
BRIAN: I will attack this son of a bitch in the
corner still. With a fucking-- I think I'll do a

00:43:41.377 --> 00:43:43.721
Sacred Flame again.

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.022
LAURA: Oh nice.

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:51.147
BRIAN: So you must do a dexterity saving throw and
you must beat 16.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.539
LAURA: That did not succeed.

00:43:55.539 --> 00:44:00.585
BRIAN: Oh! Then you must take 2d8 radiant damage.

00:44:00.585 --> 00:44:02.589
TRAVIS: Oh there you go, that's a big one.

00:44:03.906 --> 00:44:05.465
BRIAN: Eight!

00:44:05.465 --> 00:44:09.316
LAURA: Eight points. Did you already hit it in the
corner at all?

00:44:09.316 --> 00:44:12.098
BRIAN: No, not yet. Because last time I failed.

00:44:12.098 --> 00:44:19.533
LAURA: All right, it's still hanging on. Just a
little bit. Okay, Claire!

00:44:19.533 --> 00:44:38.724
SAM: (screams) Oh, get off of my face! Oh, oh,
<i>oh</i>! Begone! I don't know. I want acid to fly on

00:44:38.724 --> 00:44:45.734
you. I'll cast Acid Splash on this thing. It has
to make a dexterity 14 save.

00:44:45.734 --> 00:44:49.716
LAURA: Okay, that does not succeed.

00:44:49.716 --> 00:44:55.716
SAM: So it takes three points of damage.

00:44:55.716 --> 00:45:01.439
LAURA: It is barely hanging on, but it's alive.
It's very angry at you.

00:45:01.439 --> 00:45:09.821
SAM: Oh god! Can I just shake my hair at it to
confuse it?

00:45:09.821 --> 00:45:17.404
LAURA: Of course you can. It actually seems to
enjoy it. It starts laughing as you do. Bunder?

00:45:17.404 --> 00:45:28.067
TRAVIS: Pissed off, I cast Thunderclap at this
sprite over here. Constitution saving throw.

00:45:28.067 --> 00:45:30.063
LAURA: Okay. What do I have to get?

00:45:30.063 --> 00:45:31.050
TRAVIS: 14

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.197
LAURA: I succeeded.

00:45:32.197 --> 00:45:34.216
TRAVIS: I haven't done shit to this fucking
sprite.

00:45:34.216 --> 00:45:36.270
LAURA: I'm sorry.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.095
TRAVIS: I spit at it.

00:45:39.095 --> 00:45:40.745
LAURA: Ugh, it takes--

00:45:40.745 --> 00:45:41.809
TRAVIS: I miss.

00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:45.502
LAURA: Aww. I was going to say for a bonus
action.

00:45:45.502 --> 00:45:48.819
TRAVIS: I have sorcerer points, I don't know how
that works, so I'm not using them.

00:45:48.819 --> 00:45:51.315
LAURA: Oh that's right, you're a sorcerer.

00:45:51.315 --> 00:45:54.227
TRAVIS: I don't know how that shit works, I don't
have time for that.

00:45:54.227 --> 00:45:57.629
LAURA: Ain't nobody got time for that! Andy?

00:45:57.629 --> 00:46:03.717
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another swipe at that
one that's not dead yet, on the table that was

00:46:03.717 --> 00:46:13.423
just mewling at me. I'm going to hit it again with
my beater bat. Yeah, that's pretty good. That's 22.

00:46:13.423 --> 00:46:15.778
LAURA: 22 hits.

00:46:15.778 --> 00:46:20.510
TALIESIN: That's not too much damage. I just
realized I'd done my damage slightly wrong, I've

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.680
got a plus two bonus.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.474
LAURA: That means you would have killed that first
one.

00:46:25.474 --> 00:46:30.103
TALIESIN: That's all right. That's 12 points of
damage.

00:46:30.103 --> 00:46:41.694
LAURA: Just obliterated. It's just splattered
across your desk leaving a nice messy smear.

00:46:41.694 --> 00:46:46.105
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over to you, and I'm
going to smack the one that's right in front of

00:46:46.105 --> 00:46:52.764
you. That's fine, don't be impressed or anything.

00:46:52.764 --> 00:46:54.804
LIAM: Do something to impress me.

00:46:54.804 --> 00:46:56.054
TALIESIN: I'm going to use green flame again.

00:46:56.054 --> 00:46:57.327
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:58.731 --> 00:47:01.376
TALIESIN: Yep, that hits, that's 26.

00:47:01.376 --> 00:47:02.765
LAURA: Oh wow, what?

00:47:02.765 --> 00:47:05.449
TALIESIN: I'm a monster, I rolled a 19.

00:47:05.449 --> 00:47:07.104
LAURA: It's those Smytherpin dice you're using.

00:47:07.104 --> 00:47:13.509
TALIESIN: They're really good, I know. So that's
an eight and a four, plus eight. My god, that's

00:47:13.509 --> 00:47:19.833
nuts. 14 points of damage.

00:47:19.833 --> 00:47:25.720
LAURA: Again, you knock her down and splatter on
Allison's shoes.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.146
TRAVIS: One Smytherpin army.

00:47:28.146 --> 00:47:34.625
TALIESIN: On green fire too, so it's flaming goop.
I'm going to use my Second Wind to get some hit

00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:41.985
points back. So that's nine hit points back, and
I'm done.

00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:45.582
LAURA: Back up to the top, Ally. What do you do?

00:47:45.582 --> 00:47:50.839
LIAM: He gets a look and then, very frustrated
with how that went, I walk over to the other-- Slytherpin?

00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:53.040
TRAVIS: Smytherpin.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:59.605
LIAM: I point this large shillelagh down just to
focus direction and cast Thunderwave against the

00:47:59.605 --> 00:48:01.354
wall that's closer to it.

00:48:01.354 --> 00:48:06.747
LAURA: Ooh, both of those? You walk over here and
you're aiming this way?

00:48:06.747 --> 00:48:14.630
LIAM: I was going to try and not hit the
Smytherpin, so I will walk up next to Bender,

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.898
Bunder, Blunder?

00:48:15.898 --> 00:48:16.744
TRAVIS: Bunder.

00:48:16.744 --> 00:48:24.017
LIAM: I'm not going to hit him, I'm going to do it
wide of him, and you have to do something, it just

00:48:24.017 --> 00:48:27.997
shoots out and it's a con save of 15.

00:48:27.997 --> 00:48:33.175
LAURA: I'm going to roll for both of them. Neither
one succeed.

00:48:33.175 --> 00:48:36.566
TRAVIS: Christ, thank you.

00:48:37.697 --> 00:48:43.919
LIAM: She takes 2d8. New classes. 14.

00:48:43.919 --> 00:48:51.537
LAURA: They're both slammed up against the
tapestry. This one impales itself on the other

00:48:51.537 --> 00:48:54.666
one's dagger and they both start sliding down the
wall.

00:48:54.666 --> 00:48:57.910
LIAM: I turn and look over my shoulder at the jock
and just--

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.987
TALIESIN: You're bloody weird.

00:49:01.987 --> 00:49:10.300
LAURA: Now it is the sprites' turn. The one in the
corner with you Bryan, she's going to try and bite

00:49:10.365 --> 00:49:11.928
you again.

00:49:11.928 --> 00:49:13.950
BRIAN: Come at me.

00:49:14.888 --> 00:49:21.032
LAURA: That's a 15 plus-- yeah that definitely
hits. Make a constitution saving throw.

00:49:21.032 --> 00:49:28.246
BRIAN and TRAVIS: Plus zero.

00:49:28.246 --> 00:49:30.738
BRIAN: 12.

00:49:30.738 --> 00:49:32.266
LAURA: 12? It hits.

00:49:32.266 --> 00:49:37.709
(laughter)

00:49:37.709 --> 00:49:47.985
LAURA: That is six points of poison damage. Is our
cleric almost dead?

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:48.909
TRAVIS: No.

00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:50.200
LAURA: Okay, good.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.910
BRIAN: All kinds of tricks up me sleeve.

00:49:55.817 --> 00:49:58.323
LAURA: All right, the one next to you, Claire--

00:49:58.323 --> 00:50:03.185
SAM: Ugh! Help me! Why is no one helping me?

00:50:03.185 --> 00:50:07.590
LAURA: She's going to grab onto your hair and
start pulling it to try to dagger-dagger your ear.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:09.059
BRIAN: Because you're rude.

00:50:09.059 --> 00:50:11.369
LIAM: Proper rude, proper naughty.

00:50:11.369 --> 00:50:16.094
BRIAN: You're not as pretty as she is. Nor as
charismatic.

00:50:16.094 --> 00:50:20.458
LAURA: The first one, she gets tangled up in the
hair. It misses. The second one definitely hits,

00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:24.086
and the third one, again she gets caught in your
earrings.

00:50:24.086 --> 00:50:29.513
SAM: My hair is just so luscious. I brush it 35
times every morning.

00:50:29.513 --> 00:50:36.951
LAURA: That's four points of piercing damage to
your ear hole. Yeah. The one over at the bookcase

00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:45.222
continues to stay over at the bookcase and starts
shredding books, laughing the whole time. Oh yeah,

00:50:45.222 --> 00:50:50.481
this is a little bookcase over here. That's what
this is. Tearing up the books, pieces of book go

00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:58.572
flying everywhere. Claire-- no, Bryan! What do you
do?

00:50:58.572 --> 00:51:11.511
BRIAN: I'm going to attack it with fucking-- with
Inflict Wounds.

00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:14.853
LAURA: Whoa! All right.

00:51:14.853 --> 00:51:18.590
TRAVIS: Man, we got to start using bigger stuff. I
haven't hit one of these fucking things yet.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:22.216
BRIAN: Okay, so I need to roll for that one?

00:51:22.216 --> 00:51:24.840
LAURA: Yes, you do. Roll for a spell attack.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.435
SAM: Oh, boy.

00:51:27.435 --> 00:51:28.863
BRIAN: 25.

00:51:28.863 --> 00:51:32.287
LAURA: That definitely hits. Did you cast it at
level one?

00:51:32.287 --> 00:51:37.597
BRIAN: You bet your fucking sweet-- yes. 3d10.

00:51:37.597 --> 00:51:43.077
SAM: Travis' earring is so off-putting.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.197
BRIAN: 16!

00:51:46.197 --> 00:51:52.214
LAURA: Oh, yeah. That little fairy is smushed
amongst the plant. In addition, you also flattened

00:51:52.214 --> 00:51:54.667
the fungus that was attacking you in the corner.

00:51:54.667 --> 00:51:57.591
BRIAN: This is my detention!

00:51:58.031 --> 00:52:01.890
LAURA: Wow. Claire, you're up.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:10.670
SAM: I'm going to do what I did before, and do a
Magic Missile. Get off me, ew! One bolt is going

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.855
to hit the one in front of me, and two the one on
the bookshelf.

00:52:14.855 --> 00:52:21.135
LAURA, LIAM, and TALIESIN: Aww.

00:52:21.135 --> 00:52:28.087
BRIAN: That was the saddest dice roll ever. It
wanted to land on the--

00:52:28.087 --> 00:52:30.937
SAM: Your dice are terrible, Liam.

00:52:30.967 --> 00:52:34.467
(laughter)

00:52:34.467 --> 00:52:36.659
LIAM: These are Slytherpin dice!

00:52:36.659 --> 00:52:41.451
SAM: Two points of damage to the one on my face.

00:52:41.512 --> 00:52:46.663
LAURA: You did one missile at the one on your face
and two at the one? It doubles.

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:51.633
SAM: So two hit points to the one on my face, and
four to the one over there.

00:52:51.633 --> 00:52:53.449
LAURA: Okay, nice.

00:52:53.449 --> 00:52:54.857
SAM: Are any of them dead?

00:52:54.857 --> 00:52:56.067
LAURA: No, they're both still alive.

00:52:56.067 --> 00:52:59.398
(laughter)

00:52:59.398 --> 00:53:01.503
SAM: (screams)

00:53:02.869 --> 00:53:05.903
LAURA: Okay. Bunder, you're up.

00:53:05.903 --> 00:53:07.288
TRAVIS: Oh! It's me.

00:53:07.288 --> 00:53:12.834
LAURA: Everything in this room has been
splattered, so all that's left is Claire screaming like a--

00:53:12.834 --> 00:53:14.770
TRAVIS: I'll run out down the stairs--

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.181
SAM: Help me!

00:53:16.181 --> 00:53:18.145
TRAVIS: To the top of the stairs.

00:53:18.145 --> 00:53:20.027
LAURA: Don't you--

00:53:20.027 --> 00:53:25.481
TRAVIS: Forget about me. I'll strike a pose and
try Ray of Frost again.

00:53:25.481 --> 00:53:30.837
LAURA: Yeah, use your wands, wizards.

00:53:30.837 --> 00:53:40.933
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's instantaneous, ranged spell
attack. Natural 20. Smoke this business. Okay,

00:53:40.933 --> 00:53:49.513
here we go. (counting) That's 12 points of cold
damage.

00:53:49.513 --> 00:53:52.050
LAURA: That is completely wiped out.

00:53:52.050 --> 00:54:02.935
SAM: (as Nott) I softened it up for you. Why am I
talking like Nott? Ah, I softened it up!

00:54:02.935 --> 00:54:07.105
TRAVIS: Listen, if you want to come give me a
kiss, I won't, you know, turn it down.

00:54:07.105 --> 00:54:14.372
SAM: No thanks. I'm not interested in you at all.
Seen you walking around here and you're disgusting.

00:54:14.372 --> 00:54:16.822
TRAVIS: Likely story.

00:54:16.822 --> 00:54:21.609
LAURA: Andy, you're up. There's one sprite left,
but you can't see it.

00:54:21.609 --> 00:54:24.402
TALIESIN: No, but I've definitely heard the
commotion, so I'm going to at least come running

00:54:24.402 --> 00:54:27.311
up to the stairs and see what's up.

00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:29.081
SAM: There's a sprite down there.

00:54:29.081 --> 00:54:30.193
TALIESIN: Can I see the sprite?

00:54:30.193 --> 00:54:31.033
SAM: It's awful.

00:54:31.033 --> 00:54:35.249
LAURA: Yeah, you can. Well, you can't see the
sprite, but you can see fucking mayhem over here.

00:54:35.249 --> 00:54:38.164
TALIESIN: I'll see if I can get in a position
where I can see the sprite.

00:54:38.164 --> 00:54:39.854
LAURA: You can come down like that.

00:54:39.854 --> 00:54:45.107
TALIESIN: Yeah. I see it? I'm going to use-- it's
gnawing on a book?

00:54:45.107 --> 00:54:46.202
LAURA: It's what?

00:54:46.202 --> 00:54:47.382
TALIESIN: Is it gnawing on a book?

00:54:47.382 --> 00:54:49.420
LAURA: Yeah, it's ripping up pages.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.373
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Catapult spell on one
of the books.

00:54:52.373 --> 00:54:55.138
LAURA: Wow, okay. And try to smash it?

00:54:55.138 --> 00:55:00.254
TALIESIN: I'm going to squish it. That's a 14 dex
save.

00:55:00.254 --> 00:55:13.151
LAURA: Oh, I've got to roll. Oh! Natural one! Andy
kicking butt on these little strikes. What a jock!

00:55:13.151 --> 00:55:15.646
What an athlete he is!

00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:22.304
TALIESIN: That's-- (laughter)

00:55:22.304 --> 00:55:23.441
SAM: Oh my god!

00:55:23.441 --> 00:55:26.759
TALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage. To the book
and the sprite.

00:55:26.759 --> 00:55:34.043
LAURA: The book smashes up against the wall, the
sprite gory on the other side of it. Slides down.

00:55:34.043 --> 00:55:35.099
TALIESIN: Gross.

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:36.241
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:42.164
LAURA: In the aftermath, you realize you've
kind of destroyed her office, in addition

00:55:42.164 --> 00:55:44.715
to the classroom.

00:55:44.715 --> 00:55:50.684
SAM: What did you guys do up there? I was just
down here minding my business, and you set these

00:55:50.684 --> 00:55:56.338
fucking things down here to mess me up? I blame
you.

00:55:56.338 --> 00:55:57.409
TALIESIN: That's fair.

00:55:57.409 --> 00:55:58.895
TRAVIS: Me? Why would you blame me?

00:55:58.895 --> 00:55:59.675
SAM: Look at you!

00:55:59.675 --> 00:56:01.779
TRAVIS: Rugged good looks? I know. It's hard to
imagine--

00:56:01.779 --> 00:56:03.984
SAM: No! You're riff raff.

00:56:03.984 --> 00:56:05.220
TRAVIS: Love me? You love me?

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.337
SAM: No, I don't love you.

00:56:06.337 --> 00:56:07.419
TRAVIS: Want a kiss?

00:56:07.419 --> 00:56:10.706
SAM: I don't want a kiss. I have plenty of other
options, thank you very much.

00:56:10.706 --> 00:56:13.878
TRAVIS: I'm here all day. I mean, we've got
detention together.

00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:16.323
BRIAN: We didn't send them down to you.

00:56:16.323 --> 00:56:18.197
SAM: How did they come out?

00:56:18.197 --> 00:56:22.985
BRIAN: They flew once we opened the fucking cage.

00:56:22.985 --> 00:56:27.248
SAM: You went where you weren't supposed to,
and you messed with something you weren't supposed

00:56:27.248 --> 00:56:33.705
to, and I got fucking scratches all over my
beautiful face. I think you've learned a lesson:

00:56:33.705 --> 00:56:37.449
don't mess where you're not supposed to!

00:56:37.449 --> 00:56:40.328
LIAM: Can I raid the entire desk while they're all
arguing?

00:56:40.328 --> 00:56:41.438
LAURA: Of course you can.

00:56:41.438 --> 00:56:42.467
LIAM: Is there anything of use?

00:56:42.467 --> 00:56:44.511
TRAVIS: Which tapestry did it start to tear at?

00:56:44.511 --> 00:56:47.042
LAURA: The centaur one.

00:56:47.042 --> 00:56:50.282
TALIESIN: Of course, the centaurs. This was the
best one. What are you going to do about it?

00:56:50.282 --> 00:56:52.604
LAURA: Gorgeous. It was really nice tapestries.

00:56:52.604 --> 00:56:54.147
LIAM: They were all really well hung.

00:56:54.147 --> 00:56:55.351
SAM: They look like they're moving.

00:56:55.351 --> 00:56:56.812
LAURA: Yeah, they do.

00:56:56.812 --> 00:56:59.896
LIAM: Yep, swing away.

00:56:59.896 --> 00:57:06.065
LAURA: So Allison, you come over here. You go
rifling through the desk. Let me see

00:57:06.065 --> 00:57:15.450
what you find. Nothing really of use, but you do
find a lot of drawings of centaurs.

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.395
BRIAN: Oh, I like to do drawings!

00:57:17.395 --> 00:57:20.631
LAURA: You see a drawing of a spider creature,
which is, interestingly enough -- nobody noticed

00:57:20.631 --> 00:57:26.413
-- it's similar to a little spider that's sitting
next to her desk under a little bell jar, a glass

00:57:26.413 --> 00:57:27.591
bell jar.

00:57:27.591 --> 00:57:28.420
LIAM: Moving?

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:33.452
LAURA: Yeah, it seems like it. Not moving a lot,
but it's there. She's also drawn pictures of

00:57:33.452 --> 00:57:45.332
horses with wings on them, skeletal wings. Yeah,
that's all you find in those drawers.

00:57:45.332 --> 00:57:48.576
TALIESIN: What about the good drawer?

00:57:48.576 --> 00:57:53.478
LIAM: Can anyone get it open? Where's the rough
one? Well, I suppose you're pretty rough. Can you

00:57:53.478 --> 00:57:56.200
get that open?

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.668
TALIESIN: I mean-- Are we doing this, then?

00:57:59.668 --> 00:58:04.393
LIAM: Blame it on the fairies.

00:58:04.393 --> 00:58:10.143
TALIESIN: I'm going check underneath-- I'm
going to check the drawers I can open, see if I can

00:58:10.163 --> 00:58:13.818
find a key that's hidden-- if she's maybe done the
thing where you hide a key where the--

00:58:13.818 --> 00:58:15.712
LAURA: Okay, roll an investigation check.

00:58:15.712 --> 00:58:21.202
TALIESIN: All right. 15?

00:58:21.202 --> 00:58:27.950
LAURA: 15. You feel around the back. It seems like
somebody's stuck a piece of gum under one of the drawers.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:29.607
TALIESIN: Gross.

00:58:29.607 --> 00:58:30.966
LAURA: You keep searching.

00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:33.203
TRAVIS: I'll take that.

00:58:33.203 --> 00:58:35.673
LAURA: Oh, that is so gross.

00:58:35.673 --> 00:58:37.405
BRIAN: He'll chew on anything.

00:58:37.405 --> 00:58:44.628
LAURA: You can feel, maybe, like a little bit of a
lump. Something sticking out just a bit on the

00:58:44.628 --> 00:58:46.610
second drawer.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:48.234
TALIESIN: I'm going to press?

00:58:48.285 --> 00:58:53.070
LAURA: You press it, and the drawer opens up in
the middle.

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.703
TALIESIN: Solid!

00:58:54.703 --> 00:59:02.716
LAURA: All right. On the inside, you find just one
sheet of paper, and it's a letter from

00:59:02.716 --> 00:59:06.978
Headmistress McLoglilagh?

00:59:06.978 --> 00:59:07.737
SAM: Yep.

00:59:07.737 --> 00:59:10.381
(all repeat "McLoglilagh")

00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:12.366
LAURA: McLoglilagh!

00:59:12.366 --> 00:59:14.635
LIAM: Bob Loblaw strikes again.

00:59:14.635 --> 00:59:25.222
LAURA: Letting Professor Furbin know that she
cannot accept her request to become the professor

00:59:25.222 --> 00:59:29.535
for Care of Magical Screechers.

00:59:29.535 --> 00:59:31.411
(laughter)

00:59:31.411 --> 00:59:33.021
LAURA: Jesus! I don't know what I can say and what
I can't!

00:59:33.021 --> 00:59:36.924
LIAM: Guys, K. J. Dowling would be so proud.

00:59:36.924 --> 00:59:40.684
(laughter)

00:59:40.684 --> 00:59:48.064
LAURA: Saying that they have a really wonderful
Care instructor already, but, should the position

00:59:48.064 --> 00:59:55.974
ever become available, that she will definitely
let her know. You see little splotches of water on

00:59:55.974 --> 00:59:58.804
it, like she may have been crying over this.

00:59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.578
TALIESIN: Now I feel bad.

01:00:00.578 --> 01:00:05.348
TRAVIS: She really wanted to be a Care of Magical
Screechers teacher?

01:00:05.348 --> 01:00:10.946
TALIESIN: It certainly explains a bit. Still no
way to open the main drawer, though, is there?

01:00:10.946 --> 01:00:12.218
LAURA: No, that was the main drawer.

01:00:12.218 --> 01:00:13.131
TALIESIN: That was the main drawer.

01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:16.843
LAURA: She was protecting that poor, sad, little
letter.

01:00:16.843 --> 01:00:23.381
TRAVIS: Should we dispose of these sprites? Maybe
a little prestidigitation to get rid of the gore

01:00:23.381 --> 01:00:24.525
on the walls?

01:00:24.525 --> 01:00:28.227
BRIAN: I mean, we might need it to clean up the
whole bloody place now, after you--you've--you

01:00:28.227 --> 01:00:31.899
whole lot wrecked the goddamn-- (laughs)

01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:34.287
TALIESIN: I've never seen you so awkward in my
entire life.

01:00:34.287 --> 01:00:39.509
LIAM: I would like to also, in this room, search
behind the tapestries to see if anything's hidden there.

01:00:39.563 --> 01:00:42.579
LAURA: Okay, roll an investigation check.

01:00:42.579 --> 01:00:46.488
BRIAN: Can I look for any way out of the room?
Like if there's any way out of the room we don't

01:00:46.488 --> 01:00:47.730
know about?

01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:49.119
LAURA: No, there's a classroom door. There's--

01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:50.727
BRIAN: No, but I mean, like, is there any--

01:00:50.727 --> 01:00:53.887
LAURA: There's no secret-- I mean, you can look,
but--

01:00:53.887 --> 01:00:56.816
BRIAN: You already told me. You already told me.
Why waste a good roll?

01:00:56.816 --> 01:01:00.717
LAURA: Five? You don't find anything behind the
tapestries.

01:01:00.717 --> 01:01:04.886
SAM: I will use prestidigitation to clean up some
of the gore on me.

01:01:04.886 --> 01:01:05.896
LAURA: Nice.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.776
SAM: And fix up my face a little bit.

01:01:07.776 --> 01:01:09.695
LAURA: Your makeup looks really good now.

01:01:09.695 --> 01:01:15.168
SAM: And also I'll clean up some of the nasty
bits, because I don't want the teacher to see.

01:01:15.168 --> 01:01:17.064
LAURA: Nice!

01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:23.754
TRAVIS: Yeah, so what's the story, right? They,
like, broke out and got free and fled?

01:01:23.754 --> 01:01:31.057
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. I'm going to find the
lock on the cage. I'm going to take one of the

01:01:31.057 --> 01:01:34.685
tiny daggers from the little, tiny sprites and
stick it in there.

01:01:34.685 --> 01:01:36.111
LAURA: Oh, I like it.

01:01:36.111 --> 01:01:37.184
TRAVIS: Smart.

01:01:37.184 --> 01:01:43.022
TALIESIN: We got attacked. We heard a ruckus. We
came upstairs.

01:01:43.022 --> 01:01:47.793
TRAVIS: She might be coming back, actually. I'm
going to run to the classroom door and just put my

01:01:47.793 --> 01:01:50.694
ear to the door to make sure that no one's-- I
can't hear anything.

01:01:50.694 --> 01:01:53.912
LAURA: Roll a perception check.

01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:56.645
BRIAN: You're pretty clever for a meathead.

01:01:56.645 --> 01:01:58.233
TALIESIN: I don't like getting caught.

01:01:58.233 --> 01:01:59.244
TRAVIS: Ten.

01:01:59.244 --> 01:02:05.290
LAURA: Ten. You put your ear against the door, and
you can hear what sounds, maybe like, whispers on

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:06.782
the other side?

01:02:06.782 --> 01:02:09.065
TRAVIS: (shushing sounds) (whispering) Come here.
Come here.

01:02:09.065 --> 01:02:10.222
SAM: What?

01:02:10.222 --> 01:02:11.472
TRAVIS: Get over here.

01:02:11.472 --> 01:02:12.574
SAM: Fine.

01:02:12.574 --> 01:02:14.365
BRIAN: Oh, he wants us to smell a fart.

01:02:14.365 --> 01:02:16.661
TRAVIS: No, I hear people on the other side of the
door.

01:02:16.661 --> 01:02:18.150
SAM and BRIAN: What are they saying?

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:19.129
TRAVIS: What are they saying?

01:02:19.129 --> 01:02:21.242
LAURA: It's very subtle. You can't tell. You can
try opening the door to find out.

01:02:21.242 --> 01:02:23.111
TRAVIS: I can't hear. It's very subtle.

01:02:23.111 --> 01:02:26.428
TALIESIN: I'm going to do one last check for
liquor in the teacher's office.

01:02:26.428 --> 01:02:29.296
LAURA: (laughter) Roll an investigation check.

01:02:29.296 --> 01:02:32.063
TALIESIN: No, nine.

01:02:32.063 --> 01:02:35.246
LAURA: Aw. Alas, <i>nein</i>. You do not find anything.

01:02:35.246 --> 01:02:37.089
TALIESIN: I give up, head downstairs.

01:02:37.089 --> 01:02:39.319
TRAVIS: Is the door to the classroom locked?

01:02:39.319 --> 01:02:41.033
LAURA: You can try the door.

01:02:41.033 --> 01:02:42.853
TRAVIS: I'll try the door, but just to crack it.

01:02:42.853 --> 01:02:43.904
LAURA: It's unlocked.

01:02:43.904 --> 01:02:45.684
TRAVIS: I'll crack it a peak. What do I see?

01:02:45.684 --> 01:02:53.597
LAURA: You see a pretty dark hallway. The school
is shut down for the weekend, but-- normally, when

01:02:53.597 --> 01:02:59.840
you exit the classroom, which is down one hallway
-- so your class is at a diagonal and a corner --

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.828
to the right is a hallway that you know leads up
into the further west wings. To the left is a

01:03:04.828 --> 01:03:09.172
hallway that leads to the main stairwell that will
take you down to the main entrance, the great

01:03:09.172 --> 01:03:11.575
hall, everything like that.

01:03:11.575 --> 01:03:13.833
TRAVIS: Anyone fancy a bite to eat?

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.914
LIAM: We're just going to sneak out of here?

01:03:15.914 --> 01:03:17.122
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not?

01:03:17.122 --> 01:03:18.850
LIAM: What happens when we're not here when they
get back?

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:22.704
TRAVIS: We say we were chasing after the sprites
after they broke out, and we were trying to get

01:03:22.704 --> 01:03:25.002
them back for the teacher.

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:26.939
TALIESIN: Do you want to stay and wait for them to
get angry?

01:03:26.939 --> 01:03:27.973
LIAM: No.

01:03:27.973 --> 01:03:31.887
BRIAN: No. I mean, I brought some MRE's with me,
but I'll still go.

01:03:31.887 --> 01:03:33.475
TRAVIS: Some what?

01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:36.349
BRIAN and SAM: Meals Ready to Eat.

01:03:37.295 --> 01:03:39.178
TALIESIN: I know why he knows that. Why do you
know that?

01:03:39.178 --> 01:03:41.226
BRIAN: He's been following me.

01:03:41.226 --> 01:03:43.134
SAM and TRAVIS: She.

01:03:43.134 --> 01:03:45.608
BRIAN: She's been following me.

01:03:45.608 --> 01:03:50.335
SAM: I've not been following you. I just sit next
to him in a lot of my classes, because I'm very

01:03:50.335 --> 01:03:56.942
smart and he's very smart. And I see him popping
these things all the time. It's really gross. It's

01:03:56.942 --> 01:04:04.006
like astronaut food. They're like little
freeze-dried pieces of shit, and he just eats them

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:10.486
all the time. It's why he stinks to high heaven.
It's disgusting. I know it's efficient or

01:04:10.486 --> 01:04:14.594
whatever, but it's not right, and I don't like it.

01:04:14.594 --> 01:04:17.299
TRAVIS: You sit next to him all the time in
class?

01:04:17.299 --> 01:04:21.049
BRIAN: Yes, she cheats all the time.

01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:22.494
SAM: I do not cheat.

01:04:22.494 --> 01:04:23.815
TRAVIS: Oh, she cheats!

01:04:23.815 --> 01:04:26.245
SAM: I'm making sure that you don't cheat.

01:04:26.245 --> 01:04:28.195
BRIAN: Off you?!

01:04:28.195 --> 01:04:35.184
SAM: I have had the finest tutoring and the finest
education afforded to me!

01:04:35.184 --> 01:04:42.641
LIAM: I've watched you do it, you know. In the
back of three of your classes. I've seen it.

01:04:42.641 --> 01:04:46.490
SAM: I've never seen you in a class with me.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:53.222
LIAM: People don't pay attention to me much. Why
do you care what we think or what others think?

01:04:53.222 --> 01:05:02.221
SAM: I don't. When I finish here, I will get a job
at the finest ... wizard ... bank.

01:05:02.221 --> 01:05:04.321
(laughter)

01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:05.076
TRAVIS: Witch--

01:05:05.076 --> 01:05:13.503
SAM: Witch bank there is, and I will be just fine.
<i>You,</i> on the other hand, will be rotting in some

01:05:13.503 --> 01:05:16.904
witch gutter somewhere.

01:05:16.904 --> 01:05:19.283
TALIESIN: Blingotts, perhaps.

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:24.428
LIAM: I spin my wand and-- it's very pretty, but a
ring of flowers making you look like a silly lion

01:05:24.428 --> 01:05:26.545
appears around your face.

01:05:26.545 --> 01:05:33.235
SAM: Get off of me! I don't want to stay in this
classroom any longer.

01:05:33.235 --> 01:05:36.881
TRAVIS: I don't either, and while you two are
flirting, I'll open the door and make my way out

01:05:36.881 --> 01:05:38.066
of the room.

01:05:38.066 --> 01:05:42.687
LIAM: (whispering) Wait, wait, wait, wait.
(normally) I wave my wand and cast Pass Without a

01:05:42.687 --> 01:05:45.241
Trace on all of us.

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:47.380
LAURA: Nice. So you going stealthy?

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.232
SAM: Is that how I don't ever see you in class?

01:05:50.232 --> 01:05:54.209
TRAVIS: Yes, stealthy.

01:05:54.209 --> 01:05:55.848
LAURA: Everybody roll a stealth check.

01:05:55.848 --> 01:05:57.197
LIAM: Plus ten.

01:05:57.197 --> 01:05:59.068
LAURA: Plus ten, yes.

01:05:59.068 --> 01:06:00.684
TRAVIS: Ooh, thank god for that. 22.

01:06:00.684 --> 01:06:01.849
BRIAN: Stealth?

01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:02.604
LAURA: Whoa.

01:06:02.604 --> 01:06:03.275
SAM: 21.

01:06:03.275 --> 01:06:03.950
LAURA: Whoa!

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:04.721
TALIESIN: 27.

01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:06.137
LAURA: <i>Whoa</i>!

01:06:06.137 --> 01:06:08.295
SAM: Oh, the old Sam Riegel roll.

01:06:08.295 --> 01:06:09.555
LIAM: 28.

01:06:09.555 --> 01:06:10.825
LAURA: Geez, Louise!

01:06:10.825 --> 01:06:12.382
BRIAN: This is just a stealth check?

01:06:12.382 --> 01:06:13.837
TRAVIS: Yep, plus ten.

01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:15.655
BRIAN: 17.

01:06:15.655 --> 01:06:22.660
LAURA: Well, you know what? Everybody else rolled
really well. Okay, which way do you guys head?

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.886
Towards the left or the right?

01:06:23.886 --> 01:06:25.191
SAM: Where's the whispers? To the left?

01:06:25.191 --> 01:06:26.921
LAURA: You heard the whispers over to the right.

01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:29.841
SAM: To the right. And then to the left is
towards--

01:06:29.841 --> 01:06:37.065
LAURA: To the left is the big stairwell. You know
it well. The stairs move. They'll take you to

01:06:37.065 --> 01:06:40.477
every level, but also to the main hall.

01:06:40.477 --> 01:06:45.107
TRAVIS: We could eat if we go to the left, or we
could see what these whispers are about.

01:06:45.107 --> 01:06:46.901
LIAM: (whispering) I want to see what the whispers
are.

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:48.755
TRAVIS: All right, we go to the right.

01:06:48.909 --> 01:06:52.003
LAURA: Okay, as you walk by, you see what the
whispers are, and they're the paintings on the

01:06:52.003 --> 01:07:01.260
wall. "Oh, oh, oh, oh." You see a painting of a
jolly-looking man sitting. He's been looking very

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:07.043
frightened, actually, frazzled. "Oh, students!
Students! Do you know what's happening?"

01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:09.918
TRAVIS: No, jolly old man.

01:07:09.918 --> 01:07:14.668
SAM: Well there were sprites that attacked us in
the room. Is that what you're referring to?

01:07:14.668 --> 01:07:19.719
LAURA: (grumbles) "Pff. It's coming from down
below. Did you hear it? The professor came out running."

01:07:19.719 --> 01:07:21.078
BRIAN: What does it sound like?

01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:25.357
LAURA: The painting next to him chimes in. "Yes,
yes, yes. She seemed very frazzled. She seemed

01:07:25.357 --> 01:07:29.050
"very scared indeed."

01:07:29.102 --> 01:07:30.766
BRIAN: Which way did she go?

01:07:30.766 --> 01:07:32.149
LAURA: "She ran below."

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.699
TRAVIS: Down the stairs? Down that way?

01:07:33.699 --> 01:07:36.087
LAURA: "Mmhmm. Can you tell us what's happening?"

01:07:36.087 --> 01:07:37.859
TRAVIS: We don't know--

01:07:37.859 --> 01:07:40.073
LAURA: "We saw her talking to somebody, but we
couldn't see who it was."

01:07:40.073 --> 01:07:41.642
TRAVIS: No, we've been in the classroom this whole
time.

01:07:41.642 --> 01:07:44.728
LAURA: "Well you're of no use, are you?"

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:46.156
TALIESIN: Well...

01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:47.612
BRIAN: I mean--

01:07:47.612 --> 01:07:53.585
LAURA: "Tell you what, children. Will you go find
out what's going on? It's <i>very</i> dreary up here on

01:07:53.585 --> 01:07:55.313
"the wall."

01:07:55.313 --> 01:07:56.770
TRAVIS and BRIAN: Yeah.

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.666
SAM: We could tell you, yes.

01:07:58.666 --> 01:08:01.230
BRIAN: We could come back and remember to tell you
after whatever happens.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:04.738
LAURA: "Remember everything. Tell me a story,
won't you?" "Oh, yes," the man chimes in

01:08:04.738 --> 01:08:06.981
next to her. "Please, tell us a story."

01:08:06.981 --> 01:08:09.876
(laughter)

01:08:09.876 --> 01:08:14.677
TRAVIS: All right, stay put! We'll turn around 
and head downstairs, or towards the stairs--

01:08:14.677 --> 01:08:15.711
LAURA: Towards the stairs--

01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:18.940
TALIESIN: Is everybody feeling all right, by the
way? We did just get attacked by a bunch of sprites.

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:21.052
SAM: I'm not feeling so good.

01:08:21.052 --> 01:08:25.324
TRAVIS: What's wrong with getting attacked by
sprites?

01:08:25.324 --> 01:08:27.541
TALIESIN: You look a little pale. I mean, paler
than normal.

01:08:27.541 --> 01:08:36.032
BRIAN: I could use a little-- yep. How's
everyone-- how're you-- yep.

01:08:36.032 --> 01:08:36.985
TALIESIN: I'm all right.

01:08:36.985 --> 01:08:38.015
SAM: Not so good.

01:08:38.015 --> 01:08:43.135
TRAVIS: Well, as a Smytherpin, I'm not really, you
know, concerned about people outside of my own house.

01:08:43.135 --> 01:08:45.684
BRIAN: How are you doing?

01:08:45.684 --> 01:08:50.442
SAM: Seeing as how the sprite attack was all of
your fault, I think that you all should be

01:08:50.442 --> 01:08:53.741
responsible for making <i>me</i> whole again.

01:08:53.741 --> 01:08:56.502
BRIAN: Oh, doesn't that just sound like the one
percent?

01:08:56.502 --> 01:08:59.427
(laughter)

01:08:59.427 --> 01:09:04.162
SAM: Yes, I am the one percent, and I got there by
hard work.

01:09:04.162 --> 01:09:06.013
TRAVIS: You mean your parents did.

01:09:06.013 --> 01:09:09.054
SAM: Yes, well, I inherited some of their hard
work.

01:09:09.054 --> 01:09:10.164
TRAVIS: Mmhmm.

01:09:10.164 --> 01:09:11.942
LIAM: Are you sure you're in the right house?

01:09:11.942 --> 01:09:21.564
BRIAN: Did you get a small loan of a million wands
when you was young? How bad a shape are you?

01:09:21.564 --> 01:09:27.087
SAM: I have never felt worse.

01:09:27.087 --> 01:09:28.713
TRAVIS: Are you really bad?

01:09:28.713 --> 01:09:34.588
BRIAN: I could take care of you, but you should--
for one month, you have to tell everyone that

01:09:34.588 --> 01:09:40.314
we're best friends <i>and</i> you mustn't wink or give
it away.

01:09:40.314 --> 01:09:41.255
SAM: No, what-- Fine!

01:09:41.255 --> 01:09:49.284
BRIAN: You must, with that plastic face of yours,
convince people we're best friends for one month.

01:09:49.284 --> 01:09:54.934
SAM: I will tell people that we're best friends
for one month, but no one will believe that. They

01:09:54.934 --> 01:10:00.755
know you. They know how weird you are and how
attractive I am.

01:10:00.755 --> 01:10:04.839
TALIESIN: I would totally back that up. That's
great.

01:10:04.839 --> 01:10:07.393
BRIAN: Okay. I head down the hallway.

01:10:07.393 --> 01:10:08.606
SAM: Wait, no.

01:10:08.606 --> 01:10:09.642
LAURA: You're not going to heal?

01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:10.325
BRIAN: No.

01:10:10.325 --> 01:10:11.798
SAM: I said I would tell people!

01:10:11.798 --> 01:10:13.956
BRIAN: Not in a convincing way.

01:10:13.956 --> 01:10:21.363
SAM: Fine. I will be convincing. Please, Bryan,
please.

01:10:21.363 --> 01:10:24.797
BRIAN: I face away from her, and I cast Cure Wounds
for her.

01:10:24.797 --> 01:10:28.703
(laughter)

01:10:28.703 --> 01:10:31.808
TALIESIN: What's your AC, out of curiosity? How
easy to hit are you? Are you nimble?

01:10:31.808 --> 01:10:32.823
TRAVIS: Ten.

01:10:32.823 --> 01:10:33.842
LAURA: Oh god, really?

01:10:33.842 --> 01:10:36.340
TALIESIN: What's your dexterity?

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.579
TRAVIS: Nobody's above a 12. No, we have one 14.

01:10:39.579 --> 01:10:40.572
BRIAN: 11.

01:10:40.572 --> 01:10:42.258
TALIESIN: Your dexterity's 11.

01:10:42.258 --> 01:10:43.688
TRAVIS: 14's the tank.

01:10:43.688 --> 01:10:48.211
TALIESIN: But you're ten? We're going to need
this.

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:53.522
TRAVIS: Under your shawls.

01:10:54.565 --> 01:10:57.650
BRIAN: Nine points of healing.

01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:03.493
SAM: Thank you, Bryan. See? Now that is a classy
young man who's been taught well.

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:05.789
TRAVIS: (growls)

01:11:05.789 --> 01:11:09.741
SAM: Not interested. I have plenty of boyfriends,
thank you.

01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:12.107
TRAVIS: In your Tiger Beat Magazine.

01:11:12.107 --> 01:11:14.681
BRIAN: Pillow boyfriends.

01:11:14.681 --> 01:11:18.263
LAURA: As you head down the hallway, you see on
your right hand side there's a door that leads to

01:11:18.263 --> 01:11:24.008
your level one spells class that your took years
ago, your first year at school. You all know it

01:11:24.008 --> 01:11:33.065
well. Then straight ahead is the moving
staircases.

01:11:33.065 --> 01:11:35.343
SAM: Is that a thing from Schmarry Schmotter?

01:11:35.343 --> 01:11:36.186
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:11:36.186 --> 01:11:39.138
(laughter)

01:11:39.138 --> 01:11:41.147
LAURA: Yes!

01:11:42.082 --> 01:11:44.181
TRAVIS: The door to the classroom is closed, yes?

01:11:44.181 --> 01:11:45.405
LAURA: No, it's actually open.

01:11:45.405 --> 01:11:47.899
TRAVIS: It's open. Just a quick peek in.

01:11:47.899 --> 01:11:52.896
LAURA: It's a dark classroom. You can hear a
little shuffling inside of it, actually.

01:11:52.896 --> 01:11:55.473
TRAVIS: Hello?

01:11:55.473 --> 01:11:56.516
SAM: Is it dark in there?

01:11:56.516 --> 01:11:57.144
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:11:57.144 --> 01:11:59.189
SAM: Would you like me to make some light?

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:00.772
TRAVIS: Can you do that?

01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:07.067
SAM: Can I do that? I've been doing that since I
was 15. Last year.

01:12:07.067 --> 01:12:11.187
(laughter)

01:12:11.187 --> 01:12:13.223
SAM: Light!

01:12:13.223 --> 01:12:20.910
LAURA: The room lights up and in the corner you
see a little house elf.

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:21.980
TRAVIS: Oh!

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:31.702
LAURA: "Ah! Oh! Students. Beetle is very sorry.
Beetle didn't mean to be out here for you to see

01:12:31.702 --> 01:12:34.627
"her. Ooh, please don't hurt me."

01:12:34.627 --> 01:12:38.311
TRAVIS: You're out of place up here, house elf.

01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:41.008
TALIESIN: Report. What is going on?

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:48.180
LAURA: "There's a bit of a commotion on the lower
levels. Beetle is very sorry for it. Beetle hopes

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.752
"it didn't disturb you."

01:12:49.752 --> 01:12:50.923
TALIESIN: What sort of commotion?

01:12:50.923 --> 01:12:57.394
LAURA: "Well, hmm, Beetle wants to tell you, but--"
Beetle starts hitting her head against the

01:12:57.394 --> 01:12:58.672
wall. "I just--"

01:12:58.672 --> 01:13:01.577
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and SAM: No, don't do that.

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:04.944
SAM: Who is your master?

01:13:04.944 --> 01:13:07.311
LAURA: "Schmogwarts is my master."

01:13:07.311 --> 01:13:08.528
SAM: Oh, you belong to the school.

01:13:08.528 --> 01:13:12.932
LAURA: "Yes. Can't you tell?" She's wearing
clothes. She's wearing a very nice little--

01:13:12.932 --> 01:13:15.671
SAM: She's wearing clothes?

01:13:15.671 --> 01:13:19.982
LAURA: Yes, she's wearing a frock with a
Schmogwarts logo on it, actually.

01:13:19.982 --> 01:13:29.218
SAM: Well, we are students of "Schmoschwarts." We
pay the tuition that affords your fineries. In a

01:13:29.218 --> 01:13:36.798
sense, you work for us. So we would request kindly
that you would tell us what's going on down there.

01:13:36.798 --> 01:13:38.513
TRAVIS: You're Dryffingor, right? Jeez!

01:13:38.513 --> 01:13:39.728
SAM: I don't know.

01:13:39.728 --> 01:13:41.249
TRAVIS: You might be in our house.

01:13:41.249 --> 01:13:49.728
LAURA: "Pretty student makes a very good point.
Beetle wants to tell you. Beetle needs help."

01:13:49.728 --> 01:13:51.629
TRAVIS: Help to tell us?

01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:56.344
LAURA: "Hmm, no. Beetle needs help down below."
That sounded really dirty.

01:13:56.344 --> 01:14:00.669
(laughter)

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:07.807
LAURA: "Beetle needs help in the lower-- just-- Do
you know where the Great Hall is?"

01:14:07.807 --> 01:14:08.913
TRAVIS: We do, yes.

01:14:08.913 --> 01:14:13.120
LAURA: "Please meet me next to the Great Hall."
She apparates out of the room.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.069
TALIESIN: Which classroom is this, one more time?

01:14:15.069 --> 01:14:17.371
LAURA: This was level one spells.

01:14:17.371 --> 01:14:20.478
TALIESIN: There's no potions in here, are there?

01:14:20.478 --> 01:14:25.367
LAURA: There's nothing. There's just empty desks
and a board at the front of the classroom listing

01:14:25.367 --> 01:14:28.276
spells that you all know like Light.

01:14:28.276 --> 01:14:32.854
TRAVIS: Something is fishy here. Our teacher runs
out, the portraits are scared, and now one of the

01:14:32.854 --> 01:14:37.415
house elves tells us to meet her downstairs.

01:14:37.415 --> 01:14:45.589
SAM: Yes, something is afoot here. We should write
a strongly worded letter to the proctors at this

01:14:45.589 --> 01:14:52.057
fine academy. And we should get a partial refund
on our tuition and possibly accommodations.

01:14:52.057 --> 01:14:54.655
TALIESIN: I'll go downstairs and hit things with
sticks until they go away.

01:14:54.655 --> 01:14:56.919
TRAVIS: I agree. Let's go. We head downstairs.

01:14:56.919 --> 01:14:58.969
SAM: All right, I'll go too.

01:14:58.969 --> 01:15:05.135
LAURA: You make your way out into the very tall
pillar where you see a bunch of staircases moving.

01:15:05.135 --> 01:15:10.834
You know that one of them will take you down and
as you start to get on it, it starts shifting

01:15:10.834 --> 01:15:14.977
slowly over like it's going to another entrance.
Do you run down the stairs?

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.022
SAM: We get on!

01:15:17.022 --> 01:15:21.542
LAURA: All of you run and make an acrobatics
check.

01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:26.723
TRAVIS: Fuck! Six.

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:27.964
TALIESIN: Eight.

01:15:27.964 --> 01:15:28.807
SAM: 18.

01:15:28.807 --> 01:15:29.425
LAURA: Nice.

01:15:29.425 --> 01:15:30.047
LIAM: 21.

01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:32.018
BRIAN: 18.

01:15:32.018 --> 01:15:37.348
LAURA: Nice. The three of you run, you make a
flying leap and you make it across. Easy peasy, no

01:15:37.348 --> 01:15:39.710
sweat. What did you roll?

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:40.607
TRAVIS: Six.

01:15:40.607 --> 01:15:42.319
LAURA: Ooh, Bunder--

01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:43.315
TALIESIN: Eight.

01:15:43.315 --> 01:15:49.123
LAURA: And Andy, very surprising as such an
athlete. As you run forward, both of you leap at

01:15:49.123 --> 01:15:53.758
the same time and actually run into each other,
and as you leap you barely catch the edge of the

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:55.642
archway.

01:15:55.642 --> 01:15:58.812
TALIESIN: I hate this stairwell.

01:15:58.812 --> 01:16:09.684
TRAVIS: I do, too. Allison, a hand? I'll pull up
Andy with me.

01:16:09.684 --> 01:16:14.302
LAURA: All right. All five of you safely across,
you start making your way down to the Great Hall.

01:16:14.302 --> 01:16:16.721
You enter--

01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:19.672
TRAVIS: Wands out.

01:16:19.672 --> 01:16:26.175
LAURA: It's very dark. As you're walking down the
stairs, you can see a raggedy looking cat crossing

01:16:26.175 --> 01:16:34.913
your path. She's looking around with red eyes. She
crosses your path. Everybody make a stealth check.

01:16:35.483 --> 01:16:38.426
SAM: Are we still Pass Without A Trace on?

01:16:38.426 --> 01:16:41.329
LIAM: Yes, we are.

01:16:41.329 --> 01:16:44.421
TALIESIN: We are still Pass Without A Trace.
Natural 20.

01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:46.296
TRAVIS: 26.

01:16:46.296 --> 01:16:47.925
BRIAN: Pass Without A Trace means what? I get
what?

01:16:47.925 --> 01:16:49.932
TRAVIS, SAM and LIAM: You get plus ten.

01:16:49.932 --> 01:16:51.250
SAM: 19.

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.996
BRIAN: 22.

01:16:52.996 --> 01:16:53.891
LIAM: 28.

01:16:53.891 --> 01:16:55.522
LAURA: All right. As you walk--

01:16:55.522 --> 01:17:03.856
SAM: Before we walk in, I'm going to quickly thank
Bryan for helping earlier, and designate you as my Ward.

01:17:03.856 --> 01:17:09.302
BRIAN: What am I entitled to as your Ward?

01:17:09.302 --> 01:17:10.852
SAM: Absolutely nothing.

01:17:10.852 --> 01:17:13.986
BRIAN: Oh! Oh.

01:17:13.986 --> 01:17:15.525
SAM: What was that? What were you doing?

01:17:15.525 --> 01:17:21.601
LIAM: Flowers again.

01:17:23.057 --> 01:17:32.215
LAURA: As you walk down, you spot Mr. Borris, who
you know is the cat belonging to Mrs. Blinch.

01:17:32.215 --> 01:17:37.343
Yeah, the caretaker of the school. They will
definitely report you if you're seen out of the

01:17:37.343 --> 01:17:42.938
classroom, so it's very good that you all rolled
very high. You squat down and are very quiet as

01:17:42.938 --> 01:17:50.472
Mr. Borris pads out of the room and across the way
and enters the Great Hall.

01:17:50.472 --> 01:17:54.823
SAM: That was close.

01:17:54.823 --> 01:18:03.182
LAURA: You very quietly make your way down the
giant staircase into the entryway and look around.

01:18:03.182 --> 01:18:12.085
Poof! "Beetle! Beetle sees you, thank you for
meeting me. In here."

01:18:12.085 --> 01:18:13.262
TRAVIS: We hustle in.

01:18:13.262 --> 01:18:14.211
BRIAN: Let's go.

01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:15.465
TRAVIS: Into the Great Hall?

01:18:15.465 --> 01:18:24.436
LAURA: No. Into a broom closet next to the Great
Hall. All of you pile in. It's a very tight little room.

01:18:24.436 --> 01:18:26.190
TRAVIS: I didn't even know this room was here.

01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:27.991
LAURA: "Thank you for joining me."

01:18:27.991 --> 01:18:30.124
SAM: Why have you taken us here?

01:18:30.124 --> 01:18:35.510
LAURA: "I need help down below. Beetle needs help
in the kitchens."

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.736
SAM: Oh like, to cook?

01:18:37.736 --> 01:18:40.936
LAURA: "Hmm, no."

01:18:40.936 --> 01:18:44.317
LIAM: Do you think you could maybe outline the
problem you're dealing with?

01:18:44.317 --> 01:18:46.019
TRAVIS: Are you talking about the dungeons?

01:18:46.019 --> 01:18:50.814
LAURA: "Follow me." Beetle apparates out of the
room.

01:18:50.814 --> 01:18:52.308
LIAM: So infuriating.

01:18:52.308 --> 01:18:53.908
SAM: She's going to the kitchens now.

01:18:53.908 --> 01:18:56.712
TALIESIN: I don't even know where the kitchens
are.

01:18:56.712 --> 01:19:00.138
BRIAN: Well, the kitchens are in the down below
place.

01:19:00.138 --> 01:19:03.144
TRAVIS: Do we know how to go below?

01:19:03.144 --> 01:19:06.069
LIAM: I mean, we go to school here, so it stands
to reason.

01:19:06.069 --> 01:19:10.202
LAURA: Make an investigation check.

01:19:10.202 --> 01:19:17.804
LIAM: Every perception it's been two, three, two.
Balls. Total balls.

01:19:17.804 --> 01:19:20.542
LAURA: Your hair is in your face. How do you see
anything?

01:19:20.542 --> 01:19:22.653
BRIAN: Can I also make an investigation check?

01:19:22.653 --> 01:19:23.490
TALIESIN: 17.

01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:24.903
LAURA: Yes. All of you can look around this broom
closet.

01:19:24.903 --> 01:19:26.141
SAM: 24.

01:19:26.141 --> 01:19:29.697
LAURA: Oh, well. No need.

01:19:29.697 --> 01:19:30.814
BRIAN: 19.

01:19:30.814 --> 01:19:37.275
LAURA: Claire sees all. As you all cram into this
broom closet and start feeling around--

01:19:37.275 --> 01:19:39.094
SAM: Get away. I see something.

01:19:39.094 --> 01:19:42.551
LAURA: Claire, you realize there's actually a very
small doorway at the back of the broom closet.

01:19:42.551 --> 01:19:44.790
TRAVIS: How convenient.

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:47.457
LAURA: It must have been what she was talking
about. Do you enter?

01:19:47.457 --> 01:19:48.669
TRAVIS: Will we fit through?

01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:50.811
BRIAN: I could probably fit through there. Could
we all fit?

01:19:50.811 --> 01:19:53.503
LAURA: Yeah, if you crouch down, if you crawl you
probably could fit.

01:19:53.503 --> 01:19:55.728
SAM: I found it. I'll go first.

01:19:55.728 --> 01:20:00.292
TRAVIS: Are you sure? It could be dangerous. It
could be scary.

01:20:00.292 --> 01:20:04.471
SAM: I know, that's why I'm going first. So I can
spare you from pissing in your pants.

01:20:04.471 --> 01:20:06.542
LIAM: Bryan, do you want to get behind her?

01:20:06.542 --> 01:20:09.730
SAM: This is not flirty banter.

01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:13.692
TRAVIS: I bet you. Keep it up.

01:20:13.692 --> 01:20:14.952
BRIAN: Yeah, I'll get behind her.

01:20:14.952 --> 01:20:16.660
TRAVIS: Winning me over.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.974
SAM: Ward. Let's go.

01:20:18.974 --> 01:20:23.542
TRAVIS: Ward? (high-pitched voice) Robin.

01:20:23.542 --> 01:20:25.161
SAM: All right, I'll go through the doorway.

01:20:25.161 --> 01:20:26.218
LAURA: All right.

01:20:26.218 --> 01:20:27.949
TALIESIN: I feel responsible for some of this.

01:20:27.949 --> 01:20:31.988
LAURA: All right marching order is what?

01:20:31.988 --> 01:20:33.673
SAM: Claire, that's the armor.

01:20:33.673 --> 01:20:40.511
LAURA: No, you're not. Okay, Claire the armor.
Then Bryan. Then who?

01:20:40.511 --> 01:20:41.887
TRAVIS: I'll be third.

01:20:41.887 --> 01:20:42.790
LAURA: Okay.

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:44.140
TALIESIN: I'll go fourth.

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.566
LIAM: I'll be last.

01:20:45.566 --> 01:20:51.453
LAURA: All right. As you guys make your way down
this little winding stairwell, we're going to take a break.

01:20:51.453 --> 01:20:55.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like it!

01:20:55.674 --> 01:20:57.980
LAURA: All right, we'll be back in a little bit, I
guess.

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.013
BRIAN: You're doing so good.

01:21:00.013 --> 01:21:04.389
TRAVIS: You're doing so good, Headmistress.

01:21:04.389 --> 01:21:06.364
LAURA: Oh no.

01:21:06.364 --> 01:21:09.444
LIAM: First of four tonight. First of four.

01:21:09.444 --> 01:21:12.001
LAURA: All right.

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:14.340
TRAVIS: Is that it? It that how it works? Okay,
we'll go to break.

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:33.690
[break]

01:36:15.909 --> 01:36:26.898
LAURA: And we're back. The Club o' Misfits heading
down the spiral staircase to Beetle's lower

01:36:26.898 --> 01:36:36.156
levels. Yeah, did I just-- Oh I did, I knocked all
you guys over. That's fine, because as you guys

01:36:36.156 --> 01:36:49.026
come down the stairs, nothing happens. You walk
out. It's fine. You walk into a giant kitchen. It

01:36:49.026 --> 01:36:57.643
is a giant kitchen in the same shape as the Great
Hall. It is humungous. There's lengths of tables

01:36:57.643 --> 01:37:03.944
like your house tables all the way down to the
front, but instead of seeing your stage where your

01:37:03.944 --> 01:37:10.828
professors normally stand, you see lots of
stovetops and cook prep. You have hearths on

01:37:10.828 --> 01:37:14.877
either side, three each, where they're cooking
different types of stews and everything like that.

01:37:14.877 --> 01:37:21.221
You see a lot of house elves around. There's a ton
of them busy working, getting ready for when all

01:37:21.221 --> 01:37:25.441
the students come back from Schmogsmeade.

01:37:25.441 --> 01:37:27.767
TRAVIS: Excuse me. Hello. We're looking for--

01:37:27.767 --> 01:37:36.363
LAURA: They all scream. They scatter. They go
running, except for one. Beetle pops up. "Hi.

01:37:36.363 --> 01:37:46.954
"Sorry about the mess in here. Most students don't
see this. Okay, well, I want you all to know--

01:37:47.021 --> 01:37:56.445
"Beetle wants you all to know that your professor
is occupied. I've told her there's an emergency

01:37:56.445 --> 01:38:02.484
"situation and she was needed over in the East
Wing, so I sent her that direction. Okay."

01:38:02.484 --> 01:38:04.608
TRAVIS: Is there an emergency in the East Wing?

01:38:04.608 --> 01:38:06.123
LAURA: "Um, no."

01:38:06.123 --> 01:38:07.154
TRAVIS: You lied?

01:38:07.154 --> 01:38:10.561
LAURA: "Ooh!" Beetle starts hitting her head
against the archway.

01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:11.897
ALL: No, no no!

01:38:11.897 --> 01:38:19.573
LAURA: (sobbing) "Beetle is sorry for lying! It
was important. If Professor Furbin knew that

01:38:19.573 --> 01:38:21.996
"Beetle had lied, she would be beaten!"

01:38:22.071 --> 01:38:25.330
TRAVIS: I cast Mage Hand and stop her from hitting
herself.

01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:29.239
LAURA: "Thank you, very tall, dark, handsome
student."

01:38:29.239 --> 01:38:31.140
TRAVIS: I'm sure you deserved it. It's okay.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.057
SAM and BRIAN: He's not that handsome.

01:38:34.057 --> 01:38:35.298
TRAVIS: Don't lie to yourself.

01:38:35.298 --> 01:38:41.294
LAURA: "Professor Furbin has asked Beetle to help
her in the past. Professor Furbin had Beetle

01:38:41.294 --> 01:38:46.690
"gather up sprites from the Dark Forest behind the
castle."

01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:50.409
TRAVIS: Oh, you were the one that captured the
sprites and put them in her office?

01:38:50.409 --> 01:38:54.952
LAURA: "Yes. Professor Furbin is very interested
in magical creatures."

01:38:54.952 --> 01:38:56.637
BRIAN: Why?

01:38:56.637 --> 01:39:08.040
LAURA: "She loves them, I guess. Beetle did gather
up a spider as she asked. Yes, perhaps you

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.113
"students saw this spider?"

01:39:11.113 --> 01:39:13.677
ALL: Yes.

01:39:13.677 --> 01:39:17.077
TRAVIS: Do you know why she had you gather up the
spider?

01:39:17.077 --> 01:39:25.148
LAURA: "She said she liked them. Beetle didn't
tell her where she gathered it from, though."

01:39:25.148 --> 01:39:27.096
SAM: Where did you gather it from?

01:39:27.096 --> 01:39:28.991
BRIAN: You can tell us, maybe?

01:39:28.991 --> 01:39:31.696
LAURA: "Maybe I can show you?"

01:39:31.696 --> 01:39:33.597
BRIAN: Yeah.

01:39:33.597 --> 01:39:38.609
TRAVIS: Whoa, Beetle, did you gather it from the
Dark Forest?

01:39:38.609 --> 01:39:40.628
LAURA: (hesitantly) "Yes."

01:39:40.628 --> 01:39:45.796
TRAVIS: We're not allowed to go into the Dark
Forest.

01:39:45.796 --> 01:39:48.426
BRIAN: We're not allowed to be here right now.

01:39:48.426 --> 01:39:53.171
LAURA: "Students don't need to go to the Dark
Forest. Beetle can show you. Please, follow us.

01:39:53.171 --> 01:40:00.556
"Follow. Follow." All of a sudden I'm Sméagol. She
walks down the length of the kitchens. Do you

01:40:00.556 --> 01:40:01.587
follow her?

01:40:01.587 --> 01:40:02.456
LIAM: (as Sméagol) What is it?

01:40:02.456 --> 01:40:04.234
ALL: Yeah.

01:40:04.234 --> 01:40:05.605
TALIESIN: I'm into this.

01:40:05.605 --> 01:40:11.951
LAURA: Okay. In the middle of the frigging
kitchens, you see a giant fucking hole in the floor.

01:40:11.951 --> 01:40:13.610
TRAVIS: Oh!

01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:15.810
TALIESIN: Is this normal?

01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:24.373
LAURA: "Spiders weren't happy that Beetle stole a
child. Beetle is sorry. Spiders wanted it back."

01:40:24.373 --> 01:40:26.744
SAM: Oh. Like a big spider?

01:40:26.744 --> 01:40:28.347
LAURA: "Mm-hmm."

01:40:28.347 --> 01:40:29.360
SAM: Oh no.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.389
LAURA: "Please, spiders are coming out of hole.
Mrs. Furbin would be very angry. Headmistress

01:40:35.389 --> 01:40:38.511
"would be very angry if she knew."

01:40:38.511 --> 01:40:41.069
TRAVIS: Should we plug this hole, then?

01:40:41.069 --> 01:40:46.324
LAURA: "Perhaps students can just kill the
spiders."

01:40:46.324 --> 01:40:48.872
LIAM: How big are the spiders we're talking
about?

01:40:48.872 --> 01:40:55.027
LAURA: "Not very big. Bigger than Beetle, but
barely bigger than students."

01:40:55.027 --> 01:41:00.051
BRIAN: I've never plugged a hole before.

01:41:00.051 --> 01:41:01.513
TALIESIN: We know.

01:41:01.513 --> 01:41:03.418
BRIAN: You do?

01:41:03.418 --> 01:41:04.759
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:41:04.759 --> 01:41:07.446
TRAVIS: It happens to us all at some point.

01:41:07.446 --> 01:41:08.445
BRIAN: Oh.

01:41:08.445 --> 01:41:11.785
TRAVIS: It was many years ago, I barely remember.

01:41:11.785 --> 01:41:13.804
TALIESIN: So you're going first? Excellent.

01:41:13.804 --> 01:41:19.890
TRAVIS: Now that-- Yes. I will go first into the
hole.

01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:21.055
LAURA: You're going to go down the hole?

01:41:21.055 --> 01:41:21.748
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:41:21.748 --> 01:41:28.460
LAURA: Mmkay. There's a giant hole in the ground
and you can see a ramp. It looks like maybe a

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:34.056
pillar has fallen and it leads you in a nice ramp
down the hole so you don't have to drop.

01:41:34.056 --> 01:41:35.150
TRAVIS: Didn't you have--

01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:36.341
BRIAN: I can cast Light.

01:41:36.341 --> 01:41:39.336
SAM: Oh. Excellent work.

01:41:39.336 --> 01:41:40.896
LAURA: All right.

01:41:40.896 --> 01:41:42.365
BRIAN: I'm going to cast Light.

01:41:42.365 --> 01:41:43.471
LAURA: Down there.

01:41:43.471 --> 01:41:45.850
BRIAN: Right down in that dirty little hole
there.

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:56.125
LAURA: As you light up the hole, you can see it's
a very deep hole. It goes down for probably about

01:41:56.125 --> 01:41:58.710
60, 70 feet.

01:41:58.710 --> 01:42:00.485
BRIAN: Okay.

01:42:00.485 --> 01:42:03.056
LAURA: It's dark at the bottom still.

01:42:03.056 --> 01:42:05.509
SAM: Smart guy? You're just going to jump down
into that?

01:42:05.509 --> 01:42:07.492
LIAM: You're the one with experience plugging
holes.

01:42:07.492 --> 01:42:13.239
TRAVIS: No problem. I will jump on that pillar and
slide down.

01:42:13.239 --> 01:42:15.566
LAURA: Make an acrobatics check.

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:19.478
TRAVIS: 13.

01:42:19.478 --> 01:42:24.509
LAURA: Okay. You start sliding. Your feet start to
catch on the stonework as you go and you actually

01:42:24.509 --> 01:42:28.694
stumble forward into a run, but you do land on
your feet at the bottom of it.

01:42:28.694 --> 01:42:31.328
TRAVIS: Just like I meant to.

01:42:31.328 --> 01:42:32.869
LAURA: Do the rest of you follow?

01:42:32.869 --> 01:42:33.407
TALIESIN: Sure.

01:42:33.407 --> 01:42:34.545
BRIAN: Yeah.

01:42:34.545 --> 01:42:36.674
TRAVIS: Totally fine down here. No spiders.

01:42:36.674 --> 01:42:40.755
LAURA: Do you travel carefully or do you try to
slide like this jackass?

01:42:40.755 --> 01:42:41.709
TALIESIN: Carefully.

01:42:41.709 --> 01:42:43.177
TRAVIS: Don't judge.

01:42:43.177 --> 01:42:46.424
LAURA: I don't judge, I'm a DM. I don't judge.

01:42:46.424 --> 01:42:48.579
TALIESIN: Well...

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:50.272
LAURA: Hmm.

01:42:50.272 --> 01:42:52.459
BRIAN: I saw there's a note written behind her
screen that says it.

01:42:52.459 --> 01:42:54.265
LAURA: Jack. Ass.

01:42:54.265 --> 01:42:59.349
BRIAN: Do not judge. I'll go carefully because I'm
not going to succeed in anything acrobatic.

01:42:59.349 --> 01:43:00.805
LAURA: All right.

01:43:00.805 --> 01:43:02.057
SAM: I'll go carefully as well.

01:43:02.057 --> 01:43:09.054
LAURA: All right. As all of you travel down this
pillar carefully, you land in this very large

01:43:09.054 --> 01:43:17.048
cavern. As Beetle said, there are spider webs
around. You don't see any spiders, though. What

01:43:17.048 --> 01:43:21.149
you do see is behind you it looks like there's
been a cave-in. Maybe there was a doorway behind

01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:27.220
you in the bottom of the cavern before and across
the way, you do see a small doorway opening, but

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:32.227
the main thing that you see-- Why don't I just
show you?

01:43:32.227 --> 01:43:34.680
SAM: Oh snap.

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.630
LAURA: Hold on.

01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:38.697
TRAVIS and LAURA: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:43:38.697 --> 01:43:40.305
TALIESIN: Whoa, that's a big map.

01:43:40.305 --> 01:43:44.999
LAURA: Oh, I knocked all of you over again. Here
you are. You landed all down here. Bloop. I don't

01:43:44.999 --> 01:43:48.220
know what's happened to the last one of you.
You're apparently just dead.

01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.366
SAM: Close to the screen.

01:43:49.366 --> 01:43:50.394
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, by your left there.

01:43:50.394 --> 01:43:53.066
LAURA: Bloop. All right. Hold on, I'll be right
back.

01:43:53.066 --> 01:43:57.375
SAM: What? Where are you going? Art & Arcana.

01:43:57.375 --> 01:44:02.130
BRIAN: Guys, let's not forget. Why don't you hold
this up and give that a spin?

01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:04.758
SAM: It's so hefty because it's filled with
luscious--

01:44:04.758 --> 01:44:06.034
BRIAN: Content.

01:44:06.034 --> 01:44:09.080
SAM: Lucious artwork on full color pages.

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.847
TRAVIS: The most extensive collection of D&D
imagery ever assembled.

01:44:11.847 --> 01:44:13.039
SAM: Wow.

01:44:13.039 --> 01:44:15.839
LIAM, TALIESIN, and BRIAN: Whoa.

01:44:15.839 --> 01:44:18.857
TRAVIS: Yes! (screaming)

01:44:18.857 --> 01:44:25.423
LAURA: It seems like you have landed upon a giant
board of wizard's chess.

01:44:25.423 --> 01:44:27.332
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:44:27.332 --> 01:44:29.290
LIAM: What is going on?

01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:33.628
LAURA: It seems like it's seen better days.
They're battle damaged; some of the pawns are

01:44:33.628 --> 01:44:40.047
missing arms. There's a knight that's missing a
head across the way. The king has been impaled

01:44:40.047 --> 01:44:44.474
through, but it's standing there and you all are
standing on the board.

01:44:44.474 --> 01:44:49.458
TRAVIS: Crazy that Schmogwarts would have a Lord
of the Rings wizard's chess board.

01:44:49.458 --> 01:44:52.444
SAM: A Schmord of the Schmings.

01:44:52.444 --> 01:44:59.560
LAURA: Can we just show how hideous Schmagadriel
is? She is so ugly. Anyway.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:06.227
SAM: I mean, there's no other player, right?

01:45:06.227 --> 01:45:08.812
LAURA: (gasps dramatically)

01:45:08.812 --> 01:45:10.715
SAM: Oh no. Hello?

01:45:10.715 --> 01:45:16.301
LAURA: No, there's nothing. You land on the
board.

01:45:16.301 --> 01:45:18.487
BRIAN: May I cast something real fast?

01:45:18.487 --> 01:45:20.174
LAURA: Yes, you certainly try.

01:45:20.174 --> 01:45:24.048
BRIAN: Okay. I'm going to do something call Beacon
of Hope.

01:45:24.048 --> 01:45:25.220
LAURA: Okay.

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:26.820
BRIAN: Do you know what that does?

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:27.718
LAURA: I do.

01:45:27.718 --> 01:45:34.623
BRIAN: Okay. And then-- Beacon of Hope cast in
conjunction with Prayer of Healing.

01:45:34.623 --> 01:45:37.811
LAURA: In conjunction when you cast Prayer of
Healing.

01:45:37.811 --> 01:45:46.911
BRIAN: Yeah. So that way I can give everybody some
extra HP. Yeah, I'm that gentleman right there.

01:45:46.911 --> 01:45:50.027
LAURA: I'm going to mark this, so you know, that
it's a concentration spell, Beacon of Hope.

01:45:50.027 --> 01:45:53.548
BRIAN: Okay. So, I need to do--

01:45:53.548 --> 01:45:54.961
TALIESIN: You've got an AC of ten, right?

01:45:54.961 --> 01:45:55.682
BRIAN: Yes.

01:45:55.682 --> 01:46:03.963
TALIESIN: Oh for gods' sakes! I'm going to smack
you in the back of your head and cast Mage Armor.

01:46:03.963 --> 01:46:10.754
BRIAN: 2d8 plus my spell casting modifier. So 2d8
plus eight. Oh my goodness.

01:46:10.754 --> 01:46:18.894
TRAVIS: It's big. Yeah! 23.

01:46:18.894 --> 01:46:21.516
BRIAN: 15 plus eight? 23.

01:46:21.516 --> 01:46:22.941
SAM: What's that?

01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:30.179
BRIAN: 23 HP to six creatures. So if anybody is
down in HP, you can do up to 23 hit points. I'm

01:46:30.179 --> 01:46:32.427
using this shit on my fucking self.

01:46:32.427 --> 01:46:34.068
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:46:34.068 --> 01:46:42.616
TALIESIN: So everybody's maxed? Also, you're AC is
changed. Your new AC is 13 plus your dexterity modifier.

01:46:42.684 --> 01:46:44.751
BRIAN: Oh god. Thank you.

01:46:44.751 --> 01:46:47.084
LAURA: So 13. What's your dex?

01:46:47.084 --> 01:46:53.035
SAM: Seeing that happen, Claire is also going to
cast Mage Armor on herself.

01:46:53.035 --> 01:46:55.370
BRIAN: Okay, Taliesin, hit me one more time?

01:46:55.370 --> 01:46:57.049
TALIESIN: 13 plus your dex modifier.

01:46:57.049 --> 01:46:58.477
BRIAN: Oh, that's zero.

01:46:58.477 --> 01:46:59.904
TALIESIN: You're at 13 now.

01:46:59.904 --> 01:47:05.061
LIAM: And the Beacon of Hope gives everyone
advantage on wisdom saves and death saves.

01:47:05.061 --> 01:47:09.044
BRIAN: Correct. Thank you. I was going to get to
that.

01:47:09.044 --> 01:47:11.594
TRAVIS: Not that these poor kids won't be in any
danger.

01:47:11.594 --> 01:47:17.779
LAURA: Of course not! It seems perfectly safe down
here amongst these giant spider webs.

01:47:17.779 --> 01:47:24.861
TRAVIS: Do we see anything behind the chess pieces
or the other side of the board across from where we are?

01:47:24.861 --> 01:47:28.233
LAURA: Make an investigation check-- Or a
perception check, rather.

01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:32.715
TRAVIS: Perception check. That is a 17.

01:47:32.715 --> 01:47:38.822
LAURA: You can see there seems-- You saw something
pull back when you landed.

01:47:38.822 --> 01:47:40.188
TRAVIS: On the other side of the board?

01:47:40.188 --> 01:47:44.871
LAURA: On the other side of the board. Hiding
behind the pillar over there.

01:47:44.871 --> 01:47:46.672
BRIAN: Over where?

01:47:46.672 --> 01:47:50.871
LAURA: This one that is standing upright. This one
is the only one that's fallen.

01:47:50.871 --> 01:47:57.098
TRAVIS: Okay. Do you think we have to play to get
across the board?

01:47:57.098 --> 01:48:00.818
SAM: Probably not. There's no one playing here.

01:48:00.818 --> 01:48:05.997
TRAVIS: I'll take a step forward.

01:48:05.997 --> 01:48:11.204
LAURA: Okay. You stepped here. All right--

01:48:11.204 --> 01:48:13.470
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:17.775
LAURA: The board moves. The board moves to here.

01:48:17.775 --> 01:48:20.234
SAM: (whispering) Oh no! You're the pawn.

01:48:20.234 --> 01:48:24.554
TRAVIS: Yeah, I picked a really shitty starting
place. We need to figure out which pieces we are.

01:48:24.554 --> 01:48:26.933
SAM: Oh no.

01:48:26.933 --> 01:48:30.299
LAURA: Yeah. Where do you guys want to be?

01:48:30.299 --> 01:48:32.112
TRAVIS: You took me off.

01:48:32.112 --> 01:48:33.593
LAURA: I'm just kidding.

01:48:33.593 --> 01:48:36.950
SAM: Oh no, we have to play chess?

01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:39.215
LIAM: So we need to step on the board somewhere?

01:48:39.215 --> 01:48:40.785
SAM: I'm the queen!

01:48:40.785 --> 01:48:43.749
LAURA: All right. No, that's you.

01:48:48.809 --> 01:48:51.015
LIAM: I would be a knight.

01:48:51.405 --> 01:48:52.602
LAURA: Which side?

01:48:52.602 --> 01:48:54.698
SAM: I am not at all concerned.

01:48:54.698 --> 01:48:57.921
LIAM: I would play on the far side. Your right.

01:48:57.921 --> 01:48:58.752
LAURA: This one?

01:48:58.752 --> 01:49:00.787
LIAM: No, your right.

01:49:00.787 --> 01:49:03.514
BRIAN: Oh god, help.

01:49:03.514 --> 01:49:04.847
TRAVIS: You want to be a bishop?

01:49:04.847 --> 01:49:05.506
BRIAN: Yeah.

01:49:05.506 --> 01:49:06.601
LIAM: Do you want to be the broccoli?

01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:08.537
BRIAN: Yeah. Make me the broccoli, please.

01:49:08.537 --> 01:49:09.647
TRAVIS: A tree Ent.

01:49:09.647 --> 01:49:10.766
LIAM: That is broccoli.

01:49:10.766 --> 01:49:11.708
LAURA: I know it's cool, right?

01:49:11.708 --> 01:49:13.539
BRIAN: The albino broccoli.

01:49:13.539 --> 01:49:15.728
LAURA: And Andy?

01:49:15.728 --> 01:49:17.906
BRIAN: Weren't you in an a capella group, The
Albino Broccoli?

01:49:17.906 --> 01:49:19.226
TALIESIN: I'll take the castle.

01:49:19.226 --> 01:49:20.077
LAURA: Which one?

01:49:20.077 --> 01:49:21.649
TALIESIN: The castle on the end right there.

01:49:21.649 --> 01:49:22.506
LAURA: This one?

01:49:22.506 --> 01:49:23.409
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:49:23.409 --> 01:49:24.555
LAURA: All right.

01:49:24.555 --> 01:49:26.631
SAM: Oh boy.

01:49:26.631 --> 01:49:34.851
TRAVIS: I'm a pawn. But I definitely took my two
full things forward.

01:49:34.851 --> 01:49:35.940
LAURA: Okay.

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.400
TRAVIS: That he clearly took two.

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:39.785
BRIAN: Yeah, did we get 30 feet of--

01:49:39.785 --> 01:49:42.172
LAURA: Yeah, you did, but I thought you only moved
forward one.

01:49:42.172 --> 01:49:43.460
TRAVIS: I said I stepped forward.

01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:44.557
LAURA: Okay, all right.

01:49:44.557 --> 01:49:46.103
BRIAN: A merciless dungeon master.

01:49:46.103 --> 01:49:47.324
TRAVIS: So now, we move next?

01:49:47.324 --> 01:49:49.801
LAURA: I'll allow it.

01:49:49.801 --> 01:49:52.205
TRAVIS: Should I just dispatch the--

01:49:52.205 --> 01:49:54.024
SAM: Take the pawn. Take care of it.

01:49:54.024 --> 01:50:01.127
TRAVIS: I will cast Acid Splash on that bitch.

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:02.665
LAURA: All right.

01:50:02.665 --> 01:50:04.769
BRIAN: (whispering) Wait, but are we going to also
have to fight a giant spider?

01:50:04.769 --> 01:50:11.809
LAURA: As you do, it fades into nothing and you
take the spot.

01:50:11.809 --> 01:50:16.085
TRAVIS: Yeah! All right, play carefully, I'm out
here by myself.

01:50:16.085 --> 01:50:19.770
SAM: Don't worry, you'll definitely live because
pawns always do.

01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:24.380
LAURA: It's his turn now, and it's going to move
to there. The knight moves forward, the pawn

01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:31.593
shifts out of the way as this knight slides
forward and takes its spot. He's very

01:50:31.593 --> 01:50:35.008
intimidating, this knight on a horse.

01:50:35.008 --> 01:50:37.106
SAM: What if we lose at this?

01:50:37.106 --> 01:50:44.918
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm a pawn. It's not good. In a very
bad starting position.

01:50:44.918 --> 01:50:47.216
LAURA: It's you guys' turn.

01:50:47.216 --> 01:50:49.986
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. Who's good at chess?

01:50:49.986 --> 01:50:53.278
LIAM: I'll go. I will go two spaces forward and
one to the right.

01:50:53.278 --> 01:50:56.590
SAM: Can we move our other pieces that aren't us?

01:50:56.590 --> 01:50:58.297
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can tell the pawns to move.

01:50:58.297 --> 01:50:59.601
LAURA: Yeah, you can.

01:50:59.601 --> 01:51:04.146
TALIESIN: We just have the ability to actually
kill the other pieces if we so wanted to.

01:51:04.146 --> 01:51:12.596
LAURA: This pawn's going to move forward two
spaces.

01:51:12.596 --> 01:51:21.465
SAM: Oi, you there in front of me, pawn, why don't
you move ahead one space?

01:51:21.465 --> 01:51:32.531
LAURA: As this happens, suddenly, three spiders
come out of the darkness! One comes out from right

01:51:32.531 --> 01:51:35.076
here, and they're walking towards the board.

01:51:35.076 --> 01:51:36.225
LIAM and BRIAN: They're so sparkly.

01:51:36.225 --> 01:51:37.167
LAURA: I know, aren't they?

01:51:37.167 --> 01:51:38.779
BRIAN: They're bedazzled spiders.

01:51:38.779 --> 01:51:44.277
LAURA: This one comes out from this pillar over
here, and this spider drops down from above over here.

01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:46.845
TRAVIS: You can't leave the board!

01:51:46.845 --> 01:51:49.405
BRIAN: Oh, funky butt-loving.

01:51:49.405 --> 01:51:51.318
TRAVIS: Oh man.

01:51:51.318 --> 01:51:53.478
LAURA: It's your turn.

01:51:53.478 --> 01:51:55.376
TRAVIS: Are we in initiative?

01:51:55.376 --> 01:51:57.542
LAURA: Yeah, sure, roll for initiative.

01:51:57.542 --> 01:52:04.694
SAM: Oh god, what is this? We're playing chess and
we're fighting spiders? This is the worst!

01:52:04.694 --> 01:52:17.118
BRIAN: This is D&D Beyond. Hey, awesome. It's a
four.

01:52:17.118 --> 01:52:18.823
SAM: Is that dice jail over there?

01:52:18.823 --> 01:52:20.093
BRIAN: Yeah. No, this is just--

01:52:20.093 --> 01:52:22.665
LAURA: 25 to 20?

01:52:22.665 --> 01:52:25.806
TRAVIS: 25 to 20. Nobody.

01:52:25.806 --> 01:52:27.174
LAURA: 20--

01:52:27.174 --> 01:52:31.497
TRAVIS: 16. Cool.

01:52:31.497 --> 01:52:36.304
LAURA: 15 to ten?

01:52:36.304 --> 01:52:38.174
TALIESIN and SAM: 13.

01:52:38.174 --> 01:52:46.603
LAURA: Okay. Claire and Andy. What did you guys
roll?

01:52:46.603 --> 01:52:49.418
BRIAN: <i>Cuatro</i>.

01:52:49.418 --> 01:52:51.187
LIAM: Nine for me.

01:52:51.187 --> 01:52:54.273
TRAVIS: <i>Nein</i> for Allison.

01:52:54.273 --> 01:52:57.513
LAURA: Man, clerics, they always go last. It's
like a rule.

01:52:57.513 --> 01:53:03.096
BRIAN: That's cool, man. I got all the AC in the
world now.

01:53:03.096 --> 01:53:05.158
LAURA: Whose turn was it?

01:53:05.158 --> 01:53:06.350
BRIAN: It was your turn, I believe.

01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:08.695
LAURA: Oh god! Okay.

01:53:08.695 --> 01:53:15.383
SAM: Oh god, we're playing chess. This could take
an hour!

01:53:15.383 --> 01:53:21.188
LAURA: This pawn moves forward at the same time
that this spider--

01:53:21.188 --> 01:53:23.804
TRAVIS: Oh fuck!

01:53:23.804 --> 01:53:27.385
LAURA: Rolls up and starts walking towards
Allison.

01:53:27.385 --> 01:53:33.173
BRIAN: I don't like that.

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:43.177
TALIESIN: Ah! I've got an idea. Second pawn ahead,
two spaces. Not that one, that one.

01:53:43.177 --> 01:53:45.230
LAURA: It can't move that far.

01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:46.936
SAM: Yeah it can. On the first move, it can move
two squares.

01:53:46.936 --> 01:53:49.430
LAURA: No, I know, but the spider--

01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:51.374
TALIESIN: Is it going to get into combat with the
spider?

01:53:51.374 --> 01:53:57.846
LAURA: No, the pawn just moves back. There's
already somebody occupying that space.

01:53:57.846 --> 01:54:00.251
SAM: Do the one space then?

01:54:00.251 --> 01:54:01.723
LAURA: You could do that.

01:54:01.723 --> 01:54:02.840
TALIESIN: One space, then.

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:05.089
LAURA: All right.

01:54:05.089 --> 01:54:08.750
TRAVIS: I'm at the top of the initiative, right?

01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:11.179
BRIAN: Yes, 16.

01:54:11.179 --> 01:54:24.014
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah. Fuck it. I'm going to cast--
No, I should save it, right? Who knows.

01:54:24.014 --> 01:54:26.084
LAURA: Do whatever you want.

01:54:26.084 --> 01:54:31.192
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Tidal Wave at this
spider.

01:54:31.192 --> 01:54:32.565
LAURA: Do it!

01:54:32.565 --> 01:54:36.510
SAM: Quite the chess move.

01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:43.673
TRAVIS: 120 feet, 30 foot long, 10 feet wide, so
maybe I can take a chess piece with me?

01:54:43.673 --> 01:54:47.312
BRIAN: Laura, if he succeeds, just bring out the
dust-off can.

01:54:47.312 --> 01:54:48.398
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:54:48.398 --> 01:54:51.033
TRAVIS: You've got to make a dexterity saving
throw of 15.

01:54:51.033 --> 01:54:59.011
LAURA: Okay. Oh no! I do not succeed. The spider
does not succeed against the Tidal Wave.

01:54:59.011 --> 01:55:01.749
TRAVIS: 4d8s, so that's (counting)--

01:55:01.749 --> 01:55:04.286
SAM: You're not just focusing on the spider, are
you?

01:55:04.286 --> 01:55:10.870
TRAVIS: No, 17. Wow, that was a good roll. 23.
That was like fives or sixes or something.

01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:13.147
TALIESIN: What does that hit exactly, the Tidal
Wave?

01:55:13.147 --> 01:55:19.235
TRAVIS: It hits 23 points and knocks prone
anything that it hits. It's 30 feet long, ten feet

01:55:19.235 --> 01:55:24.221
wide, so ten feet wide and ten feet tall. So let's
say I did it this way.

01:55:24.221 --> 01:55:25.974
LAURA: So you took out the rook and the pawn?

01:55:25.974 --> 01:55:27.023
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:55:27.023 --> 01:55:29.246
LAURA: Okay, hold on. Let me roll for them.

01:55:29.246 --> 01:55:33.643
TRAVIS: If they can survive 23 points of damage.

01:55:33.643 --> 01:55:35.175
LAURA: Okay.

01:55:35.175 --> 01:55:36.942
SAM: Is it total damage?

01:55:36.942 --> 01:55:38.203
TRAVIS: Yeah. 23 total.

01:55:38.203 --> 01:55:41.234
LAURA: Neither of them save on their dex either.
Okay.

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:43.171
TRAVIS: So these are knocked prone.

01:55:43.171 --> 01:55:44.286
LAURA: Yeah.

01:55:44.286 --> 01:55:45.800
TRAVIS and LAURA: Goosh!

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:51.177
LAURA: That one is knocked prone as well. Okay. 23
to each of those?

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:52.775
TRAVIS: 23 to all three.

01:55:52.775 --> 01:55:55.109
SAM: Total. Right? No?

01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:56.616
TRAVIS: 23 each.

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.276
SAM: Each? Wow!

01:55:58.276 --> 01:56:00.214
BRIAN: Nice work, mate.

01:56:00.214 --> 01:56:01.952
LAURA: Okay.

01:56:01.952 --> 01:56:04.413
TALIESIN: Where did you say you're from?

01:56:04.413 --> 01:56:05.878
BRIAN: Leeds.

01:56:05.878 --> 01:56:08.427
TALIESIN: That explains a lot.

01:56:08.427 --> 01:56:13.231
BRIAN: North Leeds. Shit, we're going to be in the
UK tomorrow.

01:56:13.231 --> 01:56:16.173
LAURA: Did you want to try to move anybody on your
side of the board?

01:56:16.173 --> 01:56:18.466
TRAVIS: We did, we moved the pawn, right? That was
our--

01:56:18.466 --> 01:56:20.874
LAURA: Oh, that's right, they haven't moved yet.
No, they did.

01:56:20.874 --> 01:56:24.556
TRAVIS: Now it's their turn in initiative or--

01:56:24.556 --> 01:56:26.048
LAURA: Oh god. Okay, okay, okay.

01:56:26.048 --> 01:56:28.220
BRIAN: Did you roll for every single chess piece,
too, Laura?

01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:32.739
LAURA: I did not because these two, knocked over,
are out of the fight.

01:56:32.739 --> 01:56:34.230
TRAVIS: Nice!

01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:45.540
LAURA: They can't get back up. All right, we've
got the spiders' turns. This spider is going to

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.180
come up here and attack Andy.

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.429
TALIESIN: All right.

01:56:49.429 --> 01:56:55.248
LAURA: They're going to make a bite attack against
you.

01:56:55.248 --> 01:56:56.711
TALIESIN: Fine.

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.709
LAURA: Oh, that is 15 to hit.

01:57:01.709 --> 01:57:03.126
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

01:57:03.126 --> 01:57:14.788
LAURA: Okay. That's 2d8 damage. Whoa. (adding) 15
points of piercing damage against you. Now you

01:57:14.925 --> 01:57:18.596
need to make a constitution saving throw.

01:57:18.596 --> 01:57:22.710
TALIESIN: That was very cocked. That's a 23.

01:57:22.710 --> 01:57:28.358
LAURA: All right, you save against that, so no
worries. Now the other spider uses its turn to

01:57:28.358 --> 01:57:30.783
stand back up.

01:57:30.783 --> 01:57:32.033
SAM: Oh no, he's still alive?

01:57:32.033 --> 01:57:36.941
LAURA: Oh, he's still alive. He stands back up and
he can get to about there.

01:57:36.941 --> 01:57:38.612
TRAVIS: In melee?

01:57:38.612 --> 01:57:45.634
LAURA: No. Let's say he can't get you yet. He's
very waterlogged, he's uncomfortable.

01:57:45.634 --> 01:57:48.634
SAM: This is the most complicated fight I've ever
seen.

01:57:48.634 --> 01:57:49.943
LAURA: Claire, you're up.

01:57:49.943 --> 01:57:55.078
SAM: I'm up? To move as a chess person or to
attack as a person person?

01:57:55.078 --> 01:57:56.652
LAURA: To attack as a person person.

01:57:56.652 --> 01:57:58.440
TRAVIS: You have Andy, Claire, Allison, Bryan.

01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:05.348
SAM: All right. I will--

01:58:05.348 --> 01:58:10.035
TRAVIS: Be brave.

01:58:10.035 --> 01:58:14.198
LIAM: If Sam doesn't put lipstick on in the
Breakfast Club fashion before this game is over, I

01:58:14.198 --> 01:58:18.488
will be sorely disappointed.

01:58:18.488 --> 01:58:21.067
LAURA: You have to use your boobs.

01:58:21.067 --> 01:58:22.444
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

01:58:22.444 --> 01:58:25.370
SAM: Okay.

01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:28.683
TRAVIS: If you haven't watched Breakfast Club, do
it.

01:58:28.683 --> 01:58:32.584
SAM: Wait, am I trying to fight the chess pieces
or the spiders?

01:58:32.584 --> 01:58:41.603
TRAVIS: All of it. Everything, there's no bad
target. A little of both is double whammy.

01:58:41.603 --> 01:58:45.605
LAURA: You remember that Beetle did send you down
here to kill the spiders specifically.

01:58:45.605 --> 01:59:02.946
SAM: Sure, but we also want to win in chess. Okay.
I think I'm going to pick up my wand. I'm feeling

01:59:02.946 --> 01:59:11.855
a little cold today, so I'm feeling like there
should be a bit of a snowstorm, and I will cast

01:59:11.855 --> 01:59:14.298
Snilloc's Snowball Swarm.

01:59:14.298 --> 01:59:16.284
LAURA: Oh my god, okay.

01:59:16.284 --> 01:59:20.670
SAM: Centered here so everything around like this,
this, and this.

01:59:20.670 --> 01:59:21.927
TALIESIN: What's the range on it?

01:59:21.927 --> 01:59:23.891
TRAVIS: I love how wands naturally lend
themselves.

01:59:23.891 --> 01:59:25.358
LAURA: I know, it's so great, isn't it?

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:27.189
BRIAN: You guys should just keep these here for
the--

01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:32.123
SAM: 3d6 cold damage on a failed save of 14.

01:59:32.123 --> 01:59:39.471
LAURA: Okay, so all of them need to roll. Okay,
wait. I've got to say which one is which. This

01:59:39.536 --> 01:59:47.594
one's for the spider. That one definitely saves.
This is for the knight and the pawn. They both fail.

01:59:47.594 --> 01:59:50.376
SAM: So they each take 12 points of damage.

01:59:50.376 --> 01:59:52.409
LAURA: Okay.

01:59:52.409 --> 01:59:57.321
SAM: As the snowballs hit, the spider takes six
points of damage.

01:59:57.321 --> 02:00:00.168
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:00:01.419 --> 02:00:05.022
LAURA: Okay. Minus 12 and minus 12 on the
knights.

02:00:05.022 --> 02:00:07.305
SAM: Uh-huh. Are they alive?

02:00:07.305 --> 02:00:09.545
LAURA: Yeah, they're still alive. They're still
standing.

02:00:09.545 --> 02:00:11.372
LIAM: One-shots is for prop comedy.

02:00:11.372 --> 02:00:13.029
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

02:00:13.029 --> 02:00:14.922
TALIESIN: It's so true.

02:00:14.922 --> 02:00:21.514
LAURA: Yeah, let's be honest. Next up is Andy.

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:25.810
TALIESIN: Well, I've got one of these coming at
me, so I'm going to--

02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:28.609
SAM: Should we move in our chess match as well?

02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:32.257
TALIESIN: I'm going to do both, but I'm going to
attack first, so I'm going to hit this thing with

02:00:32.257 --> 02:00:44.458
my club. I'm going to use the fire club first. I
can do some serious damage. Wow! (counting) That's

02:00:44.458 --> 02:00:46.472
18 points of damage to the spider.

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:48.997
LAURA: Ooh, okay.

02:00:48.997 --> 02:00:57.600
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit him again. That's ten
points of damage. How's the spider looking?

02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:59.910
LAURA: He's still alive.

02:00:59.910 --> 02:01:05.697
TALIESIN: If I walk away, he's going to take a
swing at me, isn't he? I think we should probably

02:01:05.697 --> 02:01:08.442
move more of the pawns forward.

02:01:08.442 --> 02:01:09.493
SAM: Sure.

02:01:09.493 --> 02:01:11.371
TRAVIS: Maybe clear a path for the queen?

02:01:11.371 --> 02:01:16.074
SAM: Oh, you've also got-- our other rook could
make a shot at the spider.

02:01:16.074 --> 02:01:19.453
TALIESIN: Rook or pawn?

02:01:19.453 --> 02:01:21.327
SAM and BRIAN: Rook.

02:01:21.327 --> 02:01:22.760
LAURA: You want to move the rook up here?

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.927
SAM: Will it attack, or will it just stop?

02:01:24.927 --> 02:01:31.615
LAURA: It will because it's wizard chess. The rook
will move up and he'll attack the giant spider.

02:01:31.615 --> 02:01:40.428
Let me see. The rook is shaped like a giant
castle, so it's weird to see pieces of brick come

02:01:40.428 --> 02:01:45.733
out and start flinging themselves at the giant
spider, but it's going to happen. He makes an

02:01:45.733 --> 02:01:49.970
attack roll, and he hits!

02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:51.912
TRAVIS and SAM: Yeah!

02:01:51.912 --> 02:01:59.238
LAURA: Whoa! He does a lot of damage. Oh my gosh,
I don't even think I have this many. (counting)

02:01:59.258 --> 02:02:03.070
What am I talking about, "I don't have this many?"
I know! I've got a whole bag, but I didn't want to

02:02:03.070 --> 02:02:05.380
pull it all out because-- okay.

02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:06.368
BRIAN: (quietly) That's what she said.

02:02:06.368 --> 02:02:07.336
LAURA: Ha. (mocking laughter)

02:02:07.336 --> 02:02:09.736
TRAVIS: (intones Mario theme)

02:02:09.736 --> 02:02:12.553
SAM: How're you doing, ward?

02:02:12.553 --> 02:02:21.326
BRIAN: I'm fine. I'm ready to fuck shit up.
Proper-like!

02:02:21.326 --> 02:02:27.765
LAURA: The rook does 28 points of damage to that
spider, smashing him off the board!

02:02:27.765 --> 02:02:29.854
ALL: Yeah!

02:02:29.854 --> 02:02:32.994
LAURA: Yeah, get out, you fucking spider.

02:02:32.994 --> 02:02:34.790
SAM: King me!

02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:40.928
LAURA: Now that that rook has moved, this side of
the board is going to take a turn, and it's moving

02:02:40.928 --> 02:02:53.963
its knight up here and claiming your rook. This
knight smashes the rook to the ground. All right,

02:02:53.963 --> 02:02:57.330
next up is Ally.

02:02:57.330 --> 02:03:03.994
LIAM: In typical Ally Sheedy fashion, I'm going to
bite my fingernails and point my wand out, and at

02:03:03.994 --> 02:03:10.225
a range of 120 feet, cast Erupting Earth under the
king and queen. A fountain of churned earth and

02:03:10.225 --> 02:03:16.178
stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that
point. Each creature in that area must make a dex save.

02:03:16.178 --> 02:03:20.205
LAURA: Oh my god. So that's all of this in here?

02:03:20.205 --> 02:03:24.369
LIAM: I don't know, it's a 20-foot cube, so that
high.

02:03:24.369 --> 02:03:25.463
LAURA: Okay, the king and queen?

02:03:25.463 --> 02:03:26.450
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:27.945
BRIAN: You're a druid, aren't you?

02:03:27.945 --> 02:03:30.186
LIAM: I'm a witch, it's Schmogwarts.

02:03:30.186 --> 02:03:32.599
BRIAN: Oh, a witch.

02:03:32.599 --> 02:03:34.027
LAURA: They're making dex saves?

02:03:34.027 --> 02:03:35.712
LIAM: Dex saves.

02:03:35.712 --> 02:03:39.138
LAURA: Oh, they both succeed.

02:03:39.138 --> 02:03:51.655
LIAM: They take half damage from the attack.
That's cocked. That's 12, and 12, and two. So 26--

02:03:51.655 --> 02:03:59.197
13 total, and then now 20 feet in the air on a
pile of earth and rubble.

02:03:59.197 --> 02:04:00.896
LAURA: That's 23 each, you said?

02:04:00.896 --> 02:04:08.646
LIAM: No, it was 13 each. 26 total down to 13.
Halved, yeah.

02:04:08.646 --> 02:04:14.594
LAURA: They're risen up above? Jeez, I wish I had
something like that. I'm going to put this here so

02:04:14.594 --> 02:04:17.384
that we know that they're above everything else.

02:04:17.384 --> 02:04:18.610
TRAVIS: Yeah, Wyrmwood!

02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:20.160
SAM and LAURA: Crit Role.

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.910
LAURA: Oh no, you won! Help me.

02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:33.335
LIAM: I will use my bonus action to take on my
animal form because I am an Anischmagus?

02:04:33.335 --> 02:04:35.507
SAM: A what?

02:04:35.507 --> 02:04:41.049
LIAM: A large, oversized badger-- of course-- is
now on the field.

02:04:41.049 --> 02:04:42.557
BRIAN: There's something over there for that.

02:04:42.557 --> 02:04:43.505
LAURA: I'm going to use this.

02:04:43.505 --> 02:04:45.817
TRAVIS: Of course there's a Horfleporf badger.

02:04:45.817 --> 02:04:52.218
LAURA: Wait, no, I'm going to make you this snakey
thing. There you go. You're now a badger! Honey

02:04:52.218 --> 02:04:58.986
badger don't care. Who's turn is it? This is
exciting.

02:04:58.986 --> 02:05:02.124
LIAM: Sorry. Oh no, I have to move like a chess
piece, that's right.

02:05:02.124 --> 02:05:03.671
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it, move a chess piece.

02:05:03.671 --> 02:05:05.460
SAM: It's our turn to move a chess piece as well.

02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:11.205
LIAM: So I'm going to not provoke attack of
opportunity and come around to the front. Wait, is

02:05:11.205 --> 02:05:15.070
that what I want to do? Yes.

02:05:15.070 --> 02:05:18.536
LAURA: All right. Bryan.

02:05:18.536 --> 02:05:25.164
BRIAN: Is it possible for me to move Dildo Baggins
here? Maybe--

02:05:25.164 --> 02:05:29.282
LAURA: Well, this is technically Dildo Baggins;
he's a knight. You can move one of these hobbit pawns.

02:05:29.282 --> 02:05:33.123
BRIAN: Yeah, can I move them right here? Then, is
this me, love?

02:05:33.123 --> 02:05:33.918
LAURA: Yeah.

02:05:33.918 --> 02:05:37.734
BRIAN: Then, can I slide in behind him there?

02:05:37.734 --> 02:05:39.647
LAURA: You can't move two chess pieces at once.

02:05:39.647 --> 02:05:43.166
BRIAN: Oh, I have to move him or me? Okay. Is this
60 feet, do you think?

02:05:43.166 --> 02:05:45.908
TALIESIN: Ten feet per square, approximately.

02:05:45.908 --> 02:05:48.083
SAM: Also, we already moved a chess piece this
match.

02:05:48.083 --> 02:05:49.487
BRIAN: Oh. Well I thought--

02:05:49.487 --> 02:05:50.578
SAM: I mean this round.

02:05:50.578 --> 02:05:57.216
LAURA: Oh, you're right! Fuck you, this guy's
going to move. Hold your fucking horses. This pawn

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:59.030
is going to move right here.

02:05:59.030 --> 02:06:01.164
SAM: Oh, into attack mode.

02:06:01.164 --> 02:06:03.322
LAURA: All right, now what do you want to do? Do
you want to move pawn or yourself?

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:04.507
BRIAN: Is that within 60 feet?

02:06:04.507 --> 02:06:06.109
LAURA: Of you?

02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:08.784
BRIAN: Yeah, me to the spider.

02:06:08.784 --> 02:06:13.243
LAURA: (counting) Yes, it is.

02:06:13.243 --> 02:06:16.548
BRIAN: Okay. I'd like to take out my Spiritual
Weapon.

02:06:16.548 --> 02:06:17.887
SAM: Which is?

02:06:17.887 --> 02:06:22.003
BRIAN: Which is a giant Texas Instruments
calculator.

02:06:22.003 --> 02:06:26.539
(laughter)

02:06:26.539 --> 02:06:28.177
BRIAN: I want to whack him!

02:06:28.177 --> 02:06:29.855
LAURA: All right, roll for attack.

02:06:29.855 --> 02:06:40.966
BRIAN: Okay. Oh gods, be good to me. (gasping) 18
plus eight.

02:06:40.966 --> 02:06:42.300
LAURA: Oh yeah, that definitely hits.

02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:53.476
BRIAN: Okay, and then it's going to end up being
1d8 plus five. Ten?

02:06:53.476 --> 02:06:57.183
LAURA: Ten points of damage, all right. Still
standing.

02:06:57.183 --> 02:07:01.000
BRIAN: Then, do I have a bonus thing?

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:06.176
LAURA: I'll use this little beautiful spiritual
weapon over here.

02:07:06.176 --> 02:07:14.530
BRIAN: The spiritual weapon's a bonus action. So
then can I, as a bonus action on my turn, move the

02:07:14.607 --> 02:07:17.450
weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against
the creature?

02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:19.133
LAURA: No, because the bonus action is casting
it.

02:07:19.133 --> 02:07:19.969
BRIAN: Oh, I see, okay.

02:07:19.969 --> 02:07:25.837
LAURA: Yeah, but you can do a melee attack-- Yeah,
you can do a melee attack, that's about it.

02:07:25.837 --> 02:07:27.531
BRIAN: Because that's a bonus action I can do
melee.

02:07:27.531 --> 02:07:29.091
LAURA: Or a cantrip as an action.

02:07:29.091 --> 02:07:35.603
BRIAN: Okay. Well, I'm super far away for a
cantrip, so let me end up doing another-- Oh, you

02:07:35.603 --> 02:07:42.267
know what, Sacred Flame 60 feet. I'll do Sacred
Flame cantrip. Dexterity 16.

02:07:44.265 --> 02:07:47.628
LAURA: Oh, it fails.

02:07:47.628 --> 02:07:50.616
BRIAN: Oh. Okay, 2d8.

02:07:50.616 --> 02:07:53.783
SAM: Wow, Bryan. That's my ward.

02:07:53.783 --> 02:07:55.515
BRIAN: Nine more.

02:07:55.515 --> 02:07:57.018
TRAVIS, LAURA, and BRIAN: <i>Nein</i>!

02:07:57.018 --> 02:07:58.357
LAURA: What did you do the first time?

02:07:58.357 --> 02:07:59.198
BRIAN: Ten.

02:07:59.198 --> 02:08:00.221
LAURA: Okay, it's still standing.

02:08:00.221 --> 02:08:06.261
BRIAN: 19? Okay. Then I'll stay where I am
movement-wise.

02:08:06.261 --> 02:08:07.257
TRAVIS: Who were you shooting that at?

02:08:07.257 --> 02:08:11.361
BRIAN: I was shooting it at this guy right the
fuck there, mate, yeah.

02:08:11.361 --> 02:08:12.805
LAURA: Oh, you were shooting at a spider?

02:08:12.805 --> 02:08:13.816
BRIAN: Oh, yeah.

02:08:13.816 --> 02:08:15.211
LAURA: I thought you were shooting at the pawn,
dude.

02:08:15.211 --> 02:08:17.478
BRIAN: Oh, no. 60 feet at the spider.

02:08:17.478 --> 02:08:19.160
LAURA: Okay, wait, let me mark that off.

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:21.071
BRIAN: Yeah, so 19 points of damage to the
spider.

02:08:21.071 --> 02:08:23.286
LAURA: Okay.

02:08:23.286 --> 02:08:24.416
TRAVIS: Still up?

02:08:24.416 --> 02:08:25.667
LAURA: Yeah, he's still up.

02:08:25.667 --> 02:08:27.172
TRAVIS: Whatevs.

02:08:27.172 --> 02:08:35.905
LAURA: Now, it is back to that spider's turn.
They're just hit, so this spider is going to

02:08:35.905 --> 02:08:44.261
crawl-- Actually, it's going to turn around and
attack this badger that just came at it from behind.

02:08:44.261 --> 02:08:47.016
TALIESIN: Honey badger don't care.

02:08:47.016 --> 02:08:48.325
LIAM: Don't give a shit.

02:08:48.325 --> 02:08:54.090
LAURA: Oh my god, this-- Give a shit. Hold on,
I've got to find the page; this is so crazy.

02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:58.999
BRIAN: Thank you, Ashley, for helping me with my
cleric.

02:08:59.618 --> 02:09:03.251
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, that definitely hits, that's a
natural 17.

02:09:03.251 --> 02:09:05.153
LIAM: Yeah, that hits.

02:09:05.153 --> 02:09:17.291
LAURA: So the son of Aragorg is going to bite you.
He's going to bite you.

02:09:17.291 --> 02:09:20.655
TRAVIS: Aragorg.

02:09:20.655 --> 02:09:24.169
LAURA: Oh, and he hits. That's a natural 19 to
hit.

02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:25.311
LIAM: Okay.

02:09:25.311 --> 02:09:28.438
SAM: Oh no. But Allison's a badger.

02:09:28.438 --> 02:09:30.918
LAURA: Yeah, make a constitution saving throw.

02:09:30.918 --> 02:09:34.021
BRIAN: Wait, did your AC change in that shape?

02:09:34.021 --> 02:09:36.261
TRAVIS: We don't have a flapolisk around, do we?

02:09:36.261 --> 02:09:37.203
LAURA: A what?

02:09:37.203 --> 02:09:41.108
TRAVIS: A flapolisk? Spiders flee before a
flapolisk.

02:09:41.108 --> 02:09:42.538
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:09:42.538 --> 02:09:46.298
SAM: All of these jokes would make much more sense
to me if I knew what you guys were talking about.

02:09:46.298 --> 02:09:51.432
LAURA: You will take half damage as soon as I can
find--

02:09:51.432 --> 02:09:52.920
BRIAN: You've got some reading to do.

02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:54.841
TALIESIN: Just some movies to watch, at the very
least.

02:09:54.841 --> 02:10:01.012
LAURA: 17 halved, so eight points of piercing
damage.

02:10:01.012 --> 02:10:03.299
LIAM: (growling) Badger form.

02:10:03.299 --> 02:10:12.897
LAURA: Then, as a bonus action, the son of Aragorg
is going to call forth his spider minions.

02:10:12.897 --> 02:10:15.359
TRAVIS and BRIAN: Minions?

02:10:15.359 --> 02:10:20.939
LAURA: He calls forth three swarms of regular old
spiders, but they come from back here.

02:10:20.939 --> 02:10:22.692
BRIAN: Hey, that's where I am!

02:10:22.692 --> 02:10:27.253
LAURA: They come from over here, and then another
swarm comes from over this way.

02:10:27.253 --> 02:10:29.199
LIAM: Lair action!

02:10:29.199 --> 02:10:30.734
SAM: Look at all of those Halloween decorations.

02:10:30.734 --> 02:10:33.330
(laughter)

02:10:33.330 --> 02:10:37.080
LAURA: Now it is Bunder's turn.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:39.421
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, I will--

02:10:39.421 --> 02:10:45.799
LIAM: Can we move me before I get pawned? As a
chess piece-- it's our turn to move a piece, I think.

02:10:45.855 --> 02:10:49.654
SAM: Oh, you can move a chess piece and a--

02:10:49.654 --> 02:10:55.362
TALIESIN: Technically, I think how it is, is until
we move, they don't move, so as long as we don't move--

02:10:55.362 --> 02:10:56.644
LIAM: Okay.

02:10:56.644 --> 02:11:00.254
TRAVIS: I'm going to come here, take this out, and
I'm going to use--

02:11:00.254 --> 02:11:01.845
SAM: Oh, we moved. Does he have to fight?

02:11:01.845 --> 02:11:04.453
LAURA: Nope. He takes them out; that's a genuine
wizard's chess move.

02:11:04.453 --> 02:11:06.702
SAM: Oh, so chess moves just work.

02:11:06.702 --> 02:11:17.416
TRAVIS: I'll cast Aganazzar's Scorcher 30 feet
down this (counting), hitting those two.

02:11:17.416 --> 02:11:21.492
SAM: That's a genuine chess move, so it
automatically works.

02:11:21.492 --> 02:11:25.249
TRAVIS: You've got to make a dexterity saving
throw, 15.

02:11:25.249 --> 02:11:32.935
LAURA: Okay. Glittery one is for the pawn. Oh,
pawn succeeds, knight fails.

02:11:32.935 --> 02:11:41.344
TRAVIS: (counting) 14 points of damage for the
knight, seven for the pawn.

02:11:41.344 --> 02:11:44.347
SAM: The knight had already been hit by
snowballs.

02:11:44.347 --> 02:11:45.615
LAURA: 14 points of damage?

02:11:45.615 --> 02:11:47.667
TRAVIS: For the knight, and seven for the pawn.

02:11:47.667 --> 02:11:51.053
LAURA: Let me add that up. Still alive.

02:11:51.053 --> 02:11:52.502
TRAVIS: Both of them?

02:11:52.502 --> 02:11:56.400
LAURA: Yeah, very much. The pawn just took--

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.696
TRAVIS: Seven.

02:11:57.696 --> 02:12:00.247
LAURA: Yeah, the pawn is very much alive.

02:12:00.247 --> 02:12:03.271
SAM and BRIAN: Dang.

02:12:03.271 --> 02:12:07.211
TRAVIS: Was hoping that would be more than that.

02:12:07.211 --> 02:12:14.758
LAURA: Now it's the chessboard's move. The
chessboard is going to try to attack you, Allison,

02:12:14.758 --> 02:12:18.520
because you're right here with the pawn. It's
going to attack you.

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:20.946
LIAM: Okay.

02:12:20.946 --> 02:12:24.877
LAURA: Oh my god. There's so many pieces of paper
here!

02:12:24.877 --> 02:12:25.936
TALIESIN: So much paper.

02:12:25.936 --> 02:12:28.192
LAURA: I know.

02:12:28.192 --> 02:12:29.390
TALIESIN: I feel that. I remember that.

02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:30.562
SAM: You're doing great, Laurs.

02:12:30.562 --> 02:12:37.944
LAURA: Oh, a natural one on the pawn. Yeah, so the
pawn feels broken, so it steps right back here,

02:12:37.944 --> 02:12:43.952
and the board's going to try to make a different
move. So the bishop here is going to move forward

02:12:43.952 --> 02:12:45.418
and try to attack--

02:12:45.418 --> 02:12:48.911
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:12:48.911 --> 02:12:57.156
LAURA: So the bishop is going to attack for a 16
to hit?

02:12:57.156 --> 02:12:58.600
TRAVIS: Definitely hits.

02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:02.295
LAURA: All right, the bishop is going to attack
you with 2d10.

02:13:02.295 --> 02:13:06.495
SAM: Bunder, no! I mean, it doesn't matter,
whatever.

02:13:06.495 --> 02:13:08.544
LAURA: Oh, double ones.

02:13:08.544 --> 02:13:10.393
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:13:10.393 --> 02:13:12.832
LAURA: So that is eight points of damage.

02:13:12.832 --> 02:13:15.431
TRAVIS: Eight points of damage.

02:13:15.431 --> 02:13:17.410
TALIESIN: Oh my god, that's so rough.

02:13:17.410 --> 02:13:21.113
LAURA: It doesn't work, so it moves back and it's
going to try to take another move.

02:13:21.113 --> 02:13:23.386
TRAVIS: What?

02:13:23.386 --> 02:13:24.538
SAM: I don't know how wizard's chess works.

02:13:24.538 --> 02:13:31.030
LAURA: It's not taking the pieces, so it's
constantly trying to do the right thing. It's

02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:33.849
going to move this pawn forward to here.

02:13:33.849 --> 02:13:35.140
SAM: Aw, yeah.

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:44.420
LAURA: Just kidding, to here. All right, now it is
the spiders' turn. This spider is going to attack Andy.

02:13:44.725 --> 02:13:47.298
BRIAN: Oh no!

02:13:47.298 --> 02:13:49.117
SAM: Andy, do some jock shit.

02:13:49.117 --> 02:13:56.344
LAURA: Oh my gosh, this spider doesn't succeed.
That's a two plus-- No, that doesn't succeed. Now

02:13:56.344 --> 02:13:58.346
it is Claire's turn.

02:13:58.346 --> 02:14:00.137
SAM: Claire? Oh god.

02:14:00.137 --> 02:14:02.015
LIAM: Oh boy.

02:14:02.015 --> 02:14:07.226
SAM: I will attack.

02:14:07.226 --> 02:14:08.717
TRAVIS: Andy's before Claire.

02:14:08.717 --> 02:14:09.410
LAURA: What?

02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:11.163
TALIESIN: We share our numbers, so it doesn't
matter.

02:14:11.163 --> 02:14:13.486
SAM: Andy, you go first. Give me time to think.

02:14:13.486 --> 02:14:17.918
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to keep wailing on that
spider. Hopefully it'll go down at some point.

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:23.878
Let's take two attacks-- I'll just start with one
attack on that spider. This will be my flame

02:14:23.878 --> 02:14:28.845
attack. 16 plus seven, that I assume hits.

02:14:28.845 --> 02:14:29.971
LAURA: That does hit.

02:14:29.971 --> 02:14:31.084
LIAM: Taliesin's killing it.

02:14:31.084 --> 02:14:32.889
TALIESIN: I know, it's crazy.

02:14:32.889 --> 02:14:34.315
LIAM: Slytherpin.

02:14:34.315 --> 02:14:39.531
TALIESIN: That's 13 points of damage.

02:14:39.531 --> 02:14:46.415
LAURA: 13 points of damage! With that, the spider
is crushed beneath the weight of your club. Andy

02:14:46.415 --> 02:14:48.510
the athlete, once again, succeeds.

02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:50.563
BRIAN: Nice.

02:14:50.563 --> 02:14:59.490
SAM: Claire will use Acid Splash on that spider
that's menacing our badger friend, Ally.

02:14:59.490 --> 02:15:00.995
LAURA: Can you do it that far away?

02:15:00.995 --> 02:15:01.979
SAM: It's 60 feet.

02:15:01.979 --> 02:15:03.242
LAURA: Awesome.

02:15:03.242 --> 02:15:05.806
SAM: 14 dex save.

02:15:05.806 --> 02:15:11.562
LAURA: All right. And that you would also hit the
pawn in front of you, wouldn't you? No, it doesn't

02:15:11.562 --> 02:15:16.659
matter, it's your teammate. Fuck it. Oh, that's an
18, that saves.

02:15:16.659 --> 02:15:18.464
SAM: Oh, which does that take, no damage?

02:15:18.464 --> 02:15:19.954
TALIESIN: Half, probably.

02:15:19.954 --> 02:15:21.511
LAURA: Is it a cantrip?

02:15:21.511 --> 02:15:26.549
SAM: No, it just saves. There's nothing. Aw, poo.

02:15:26.549 --> 02:15:28.071
LAURA: Do you want to move?

02:15:28.071 --> 02:15:31.447
SAM: Am I allowed to? Is it our move in chess?

02:15:31.447 --> 02:15:33.100
LAURA: It's your move in chess.

02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:37.679
SAM: Well, I can't move, but I can move one of the
other players. I guess I could move one space out,

02:15:37.679 --> 02:15:39.134
but that seems like a waste.

02:15:39.134 --> 02:15:41.963
BRIAN: You could move that pawn there to attack
the spider.

02:15:41.963 --> 02:15:44.368
SAM: Which one?

02:15:44.368 --> 02:15:48.150
BRIAN: Or that Dildo Baggins right there. Can he
move forward and then that challenges--

02:15:48.150 --> 02:15:49.534
LAURA: They attack diagonally.

02:15:49.534 --> 02:15:51.583
TALIESIN: But if it moves one then the next--
well.

02:15:51.583 --> 02:15:55.236
SAM: Let's move--

02:15:55.236 --> 02:15:59.397
TALIESIN: If it moves one, then the next attack
will be its attack.

02:15:59.397 --> 02:16:08.677
SAM: Let's move our bishop, Dildo Baggins over
there, out one space to get ready for some

02:16:08.677 --> 02:16:12.108
business. It's business time.

02:16:12.108 --> 02:16:15.051
TRAVIS: Hard to keep track of them over this short
hobbits.

02:16:15.051 --> 02:16:17.713
SAM: Yeah, they are almost the exact same design.

02:16:17.713 --> 02:16:24.404
LAURA: I know, it's pretty fucked up. Yeah. God,
this is difficult. Well, this one is going to try

02:16:24.404 --> 02:16:27.177
once again to take your piece.

02:16:27.177 --> 02:16:30.471
BRIAN: Is that E.T.? It looks like E.T. from the
back.

02:16:30.471 --> 02:16:32.970
TRAVIS and LAURA: That's Sm�agol.

02:16:32.970 --> 02:16:35.452
LAURA: That's a natural 20!

02:16:35.452 --> 02:16:39.334
SAM: Oh schnikes. The pawn is going down.

02:16:39.334 --> 02:16:41.574
TALIESIN: Might be the end of you yet.

02:16:41.574 --> 02:16:43.238
BRIAN: Might be the end of you, mate.

02:16:43.238 --> 02:16:48.760
LAURA: It's going to do-- Oh, god. That's 2d10
plus six.

02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:52.742
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

02:16:52.742 --> 02:16:55.259
TRAVIS: Most are like five.

02:16:55.259 --> 02:16:58.003
LAURA: That's cocked.

02:16:58.003 --> 02:17:01.123
TRAVIS: Should have put Mage Armor on myself.

02:17:01.123 --> 02:17:02.763
LAURA: 18 points of damage.

02:17:02.763 --> 02:17:10.607
TRAVIS: 18?
Excellent! Got some sweet battle damage.

02:17:10.607 --> 02:17:12.330
LIAM: You got like five bucks or something?

02:17:12.330 --> 02:17:14.467
TRAVIS: No, I'm in doubles. I'm in double digits.

02:17:14.467 --> 02:17:16.184
LAURA: Oh, wait-- that was a crit, wasn't it?

02:17:16.184 --> 02:17:18.637
LIAM: Oh, shit!

02:17:18.637 --> 02:17:20.922
TRAVIS: Is that 36 points of damage?!

02:17:20.922 --> 02:17:22.626
LAURA: Wait, no, because it's--

02:17:22.626 --> 02:17:24.295
LIAM: The dice.

02:17:24.295 --> 02:17:26.449
TALIESIN: Probably 28, is my guess.

02:17:26.449 --> 02:17:31.562
LAURA: Times two is 24. That's 30 point of
damage.

02:17:31.562 --> 02:17:33.761
TRAVIS: I'm unconscious.

02:17:33.761 --> 02:17:36.869
LAURA: Oh no! Bunder's down!

02:17:36.869 --> 02:17:41.691
LIAM, TRAVIS, and SAM: (intone "Bad to the Bone")

02:17:41.691 --> 02:17:46.804
LAURA: The bishop pushes you out of the way and
the fallen body of Bunder is now here.

02:17:46.804 --> 02:17:48.905
TRAVIS: Am I pushed off the board near the
spider?

02:17:48.905 --> 02:17:50.100
LAURA: No, you're just sitting there.

02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:50.837
TRAVIS: Good.

02:17:50.837 --> 02:17:51.967
SAM: Oh no!

02:17:51.967 --> 02:17:53.662
TRAVIS: (whispering) Help!

02:17:53.662 --> 02:17:57.801
LAURA: Oh, I didn't roll initiative for those.
They'll just go with him. Okay.

02:17:57.801 --> 02:17:59.368
TRAVIS: Oh my god. I'm going to die.

02:17:59.368 --> 02:18:00.660
SAM: You must have some sort of healing--

02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:03.065
LIAM: You're a wizard, Larry!

02:18:03.065 --> 02:18:05.547
LAURA: It's Ally's turn.

02:18:05.547 --> 02:18:14.679
LIAM: Right. The badger is going to lay into the
spider with a multi-attack, bite and claws. First,

02:18:14.679 --> 02:18:18.991
we'll do the bite. That is an 18 to hit.

02:18:18.991 --> 02:18:20.927
LAURA: That definitely hits.

02:18:20.927 --> 02:18:25.499
LIAM: Okay, so for the teeth sink in and do four
points of damage.

02:18:25.499 --> 02:18:27.210
SAM: Yeah, badger attack!

02:18:27.210 --> 02:18:34.453
LIAM: Then claws. That is a six with the claws.
That do not hit.

02:18:34.453 --> 02:18:36.657
LAURA: Oh, they don't even hit. Oh god, okay.

02:18:36.657 --> 02:18:41.245
LIAM: So just (growling) digs to the earth.

02:18:41.245 --> 02:18:44.968
LAURA: Badgers are tough, though! They're real
tough. Horfleporf forever!

02:18:44.968 --> 02:18:46.270
LIAM: Not anymore.

02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:48.559
LAURA: Okay. Bryan, it's your turn.

02:18:48.559 --> 02:18:49.876
BRIAN: Okay.

02:18:50.766 --> 02:18:56.015
SAM: Do you need to get to Travis? I mean, what's
his face.

02:18:56.015 --> 02:18:57.484
LAURA: Bunder.

02:18:57.484 --> 02:18:59.134
TALIESIN and SAM: Blunder.

02:18:59.134 --> 02:19:00.792
BRIAN: If it's touch, do I need to be there to
touch him?

02:19:00.792 --> 02:19:01.791
LAURA: Yeah.

02:19:01.791 --> 02:19:04.048
SAM: Why don't you-- Oh.

02:19:04.048 --> 02:19:06.339
BRIAN: I can only move 30 feet.

02:19:06.339 --> 02:19:10.055
SAM: Also, you can only move-- Oh wait, no! He's a
horsey!

02:19:10.055 --> 02:19:11.277
LAURA: Yep.

02:19:11.277 --> 02:19:13.961
SAM: Okay, you can start getting over there.

02:19:13.961 --> 02:19:22.030
BRIAN: Okay, I'll try and make my way over to
d-bag over there, however far 30 feet is.

02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:23.207
LAURA: So that's your move?

02:19:23.207 --> 02:19:24.976
BRIAN: Yeah, that's my move.

02:19:24.976 --> 02:19:26.498
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:19:26.498 --> 02:19:32.012
BRIAN: Okay, so the only thing I can do is--

02:19:32.012 --> 02:19:37.153
TRAVIS: Well, actually, that one can't hit me, but
the spider can.

02:19:37.153 --> 02:19:42.047
BRIAN: I can do Prayer of Healing again, that's 30
feet now that I'm closer.

02:19:42.047 --> 02:19:43.970
LAURA: What's the casting time on Prayer of
Healing?

02:19:43.970 --> 02:19:49.188
BRIAN: That's duration... Ten minutes. Oh, fuck
my--

02:19:50.808 --> 02:19:52.805
SAM: The casting time is ten minutes?

02:19:52.805 --> 02:19:56.516
BRIAN: Sorry, I'm new to cleric. Okay, then if I
move--

02:19:56.516 --> 02:19:57.803
TRAVIS: The struggle is real.

02:19:57.803 --> 02:20:02.266
BRIAN: I can't really-- Since I don't waste my
turn, let me try and attack. Can I shoot something

02:20:02.266 --> 02:20:03.595
at that spider?

02:20:03.595 --> 02:20:04.697
LAURA: Totally.

02:20:04.697 --> 02:20:09.852
BRIAN: I'm going to shoot it with a big fat chunk
of-- I'll do Sacred Flame again.

02:20:09.852 --> 02:20:11.636
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:14.487
BRIAN: Dex 16.

02:20:14.487 --> 02:20:20.925
LAURA: It gets 16, so that's a save.

02:20:20.925 --> 02:20:22.886
TRAVIS: Ugh.

02:20:22.886 --> 02:20:25.153
LAURA: But you do have your spiritual still
sitting out there which means--

02:20:25.153 --> 02:20:30.543
BRIAN: Okay, then I'll do as a bonus action my
spiritual weapon melee attack. Is it just melee attack?

02:20:30.684 --> 02:20:31.468
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:20:31.468 --> 02:20:33.505
BRIAN: Yeah, okay. So do I need to do a--

02:20:33.505 --> 02:20:35.520
LAURA: You add your spell modifier.

02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:41.790
BRIAN: Okay. Oh, please. Natural one.

02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:47.869
LAURA: Your calculator glitches, it just writes
"boobs" upside down.

02:20:47.869 --> 02:20:50.843
TRAVIS: Boobs. Starts playing snake.

02:20:50.843 --> 02:20:59.644
LAURA: Son of Aragorg, it's their turn. The son is
going to attack Ally once more, with a-- I guess

02:20:59.644 --> 02:21:08.865
it's very close, so it's going to do a bite attack
again. Oh, that does not succeed. They are going

02:21:08.865 --> 02:21:14.482
to use their bonus action to move their swarms in
and this swarm of spiders is going to go

02:21:14.482 --> 02:21:21.700
(scratching) and comes towards you. This swarm is
going to over towards Claire. This swarm is going

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:34.408
to go (scratching) and come towards Ally. Those
swarms, they don't do a ton, but they're going to

02:21:34.408 --> 02:21:49.151
do-- That's a five against-- nope, that doesn't
hit. Then the last one, this is against Ally. That

02:21:49.151 --> 02:21:50.996
is a 12?

02:21:50.996 --> 02:21:52.373
LIAM: Hits.

02:21:52.373 --> 02:21:57.145
LAURA: They're going to cover you and try to bite
you in your badger form.

02:21:57.145 --> 02:21:59.220
LIAM: (growling)

02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:12.295
LAURA: All right, so that's 4d4 here. Seven points
of damage.

02:22:12.295 --> 02:22:13.988
LIAM: Okay, that's the total?

02:22:13.988 --> 02:22:14.791
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:22:14.791 --> 02:22:19.599
LIAM: Okay, Ally stands in her raggedy, normal
form.

02:22:19.599 --> 02:22:21.751
LAURA: Ah! All right.

02:22:21.751 --> 02:22:22.983
LIAM: What was the total, did you say?

02:22:22.983 --> 02:22:23.853
LAURA: Seven.

02:22:23.853 --> 02:22:26.128
LIAM: Seven? Great.

02:22:26.128 --> 02:22:34.710
LAURA: Where did I put you, Ally? I don't
remember. Oh, you're over here. Bloop! Ally's back.

02:22:35.109 --> 02:22:37.121
TRAVIS: She's back!

02:22:37.121 --> 02:22:45.693
LAURA: All right. It is Bunder's turn.

02:22:45.693 --> 02:22:52.935
TRAVIS: (burps) Death saving throw. Seven.

02:22:52.935 --> 02:23:01.261
LAURA: Oh, no! Bunder! The spiders are dead, their
turn is gone. It's Claire's turn!

02:23:01.261 --> 02:23:13.174
SAM: Oh, jesus. Jesus, these spiders! Not really
having anything else to do, I'm going to send

02:23:13.174 --> 02:23:19.549
Magic Missile-- no, that'll use my last 1st-level
spell slot. I'll use Acid Splash to attack that

02:23:19.549 --> 02:23:20.769
same spider.

02:23:20.769 --> 02:23:22.433
LAURA: Don't you have higher level spells?

02:23:22.433 --> 02:23:23.462
SAM: Sure.

02:23:23.462 --> 02:23:24.979
LIAM: What are you saving them for?

02:23:24.979 --> 02:23:26.234
SAM: Is this it?

02:23:26.234 --> 02:23:27.572
LAURA: This is a pretty big battle.

02:23:27.572 --> 02:23:33.850
TRAVIS: We're fighting D&D on a chess board. I
don't know what else is in store.

02:23:33.850 --> 02:23:35.345
SAM: I'll do Magic Missile.

02:23:35.345 --> 02:23:36.940
LAURA: This is a one-shot, it's not going to go--

02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:41.958
SAM: I'll do Magic Missile against the spider
that's menacing our Allison friend.

02:23:41.958 --> 02:23:42.822
LAURA: Okay.

02:23:42.822 --> 02:23:43.646
TRAVIS: No short rest.

02:23:43.646 --> 02:23:45.353
LIAM: I'll cast Mending.

02:23:45.353 --> 02:23:46.962
SAM: All three darts.

02:23:46.962 --> 02:23:47.971
LAURA: Okay.

02:23:47.971 --> 02:23:51.004
SAM: Oh, that's good! 12 points of damage.

02:23:51.004 --> 02:23:55.650
LAURA: Okay! All right, that's total?

02:23:55.650 --> 02:23:56.650
SAM: Yeah?

02:23:56.650 --> 02:23:59.512
LAURA: Okay.

02:23:59.512 --> 02:24:08.310
SAM: Wait, what happens if I do it at 2nd-level?
Oh, that's an extra four points. I'll do it at

02:24:08.310 --> 02:24:11.165
2nd-level! That's 16 points of damage!

02:24:11.165 --> 02:24:19.173
LAURA: All right. Minus 40-- all right, 45 points
down, good job. We're at Andy.

02:24:19.173 --> 02:24:22.824
SAM: Oh, wait, do we move? Chess-wise?

02:24:22.824 --> 02:24:25.273
LAURA: No, the chess board has not moved.

02:24:25.273 --> 02:24:27.059
SAM: Is it our turn?

02:24:27.059 --> 02:24:28.473
LAURA: No, you haven't taken your turn yet.

02:24:28.473 --> 02:24:31.088
SAM: I'm going to move Bryan up to right there.

02:24:31.088 --> 02:24:34.203
BRIAN: Ugh, yes.

02:24:34.203 --> 02:24:35.867
SAM: Doink!

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:39.189
LAURA: All right. It's Andy's turn.

02:24:39.189 --> 02:24:49.282
TALIESIN: I'm kind of stuck, aren't I? I'm going
to try something weird. I'm going to cast Grease

02:24:49.282 --> 02:24:51.440
on the king and queen.

02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:52.473
TRAVIS: Grease?

02:24:52.473 --> 02:24:54.822
SAM: It's the word.

02:24:54.822 --> 02:24:59.363
TALIESIN: They're the ones that I want. They're
the ones that-- Oh, oh, oh. Wait.

02:24:59.363 --> 02:25:00.745
LIAM: I got chills.

02:25:00.745 --> 02:25:02.328
LAURA: Up high, all right.

02:25:02.328 --> 02:25:06.412
TALIESIN: I'm casting Grease on those two there.
They have to make a dex save of 14.

02:25:06.412 --> 02:25:15.655
LAURA: Okay. The king succeeds, the queen fails.

02:25:15.655 --> 02:25:17.176
TALIESIN: She is prone.

02:25:17.176 --> 02:25:20.723
LAURA: Oh, the queen knocked prone, which means
she is wiped off the board.

02:25:20.723 --> 02:25:32.186
TALIESIN: Also, this is up for a minute, and a
creature that enters the area or ends its turn

02:25:32.186 --> 02:25:35.606
there must also succeed on a dexterity saving
throw or fall prone. So if he tries to move, he

02:25:35.606 --> 02:25:37.297
has to try again.

02:25:37.297 --> 02:25:44.895
LAURA: Got it. Very nice! It is the board's turn
to move.

02:25:44.895 --> 02:25:49.541
TRAVIS: Did you move a piece?

02:25:49.541 --> 02:25:54.310
BRIAN: We moved me up to you.

02:25:54.310 --> 02:26:00.364
LAURA: This piece is going to come over here.
That's a dumb move, but it's doing it. It's taking

02:26:00.364 --> 02:26:09.739
this pawn. All right, now it is Ally's turn.

02:26:09.739 --> 02:26:15.945
LIAM: Ally starts to twist her wand in the air in
a big circle and a gigantic cloud appears over the

02:26:15.945 --> 02:26:22.190
entire chess field and all of us, and lightning
comes down on the king.

02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:23.734
LAURA: Holy shit!

02:26:23.734 --> 02:26:28.662
LIAM: Level three. So that is a dex save, 15.

02:26:30.163 --> 02:26:31.464
LAURA: Natural 19.

02:26:31.464 --> 02:26:32.637
LIAM: Dang!

02:26:32.637 --> 02:26:34.414
TALIESIN: Can't fuck with the king, man.

02:26:34.414 --> 02:26:47.398
LIAM: Oh, that's the wrong die. It's all ten
sides. (counting) 22, so 11 points of lightning

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:49.660
damage on the king.

02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:52.845
LAURA: All right, the king looks a little hurt.

02:26:52.845 --> 02:26:55.552
LIAM: The storm keeps roiling above us all.

02:26:55.552 --> 02:26:57.811
LAURA: Awesome. Bryan?

02:26:57.811 --> 02:27:15.896
BRIAN: Okay, I am going to cast Cure Wounds right
into his heart. That's 1d8 plus five. Ten.

02:27:15.896 --> 02:27:19.849
TRAVIS: Ten points. I'll take it.

02:27:19.849 --> 02:27:24.412
LIAM: Did you have a wand to your chest like Pulp
Fiction? (gasping)

02:27:24.412 --> 02:27:26.280
BRIAN: The adrenaline jump? Yeah.

02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:27.918
LAURA: All right, do you want to do anything
else?

02:27:27.918 --> 02:27:36.393
BRIAN: I also would like to-- let's see, where
should we go? I don't want me to have to be the

02:27:36.393 --> 02:27:38.256
movement, though, for the whole round.

02:27:38.256 --> 02:27:39.684
SAM: We haven't moved yet this round.

02:27:39.684 --> 02:27:47.376
BRIAN: We moved me last time, so I don't want to
move again. I think maybe bonus action-- no,

02:27:47.376 --> 02:27:49.803
spiritual weapon's going to use another spell
slot.

02:27:49.803 --> 02:27:54.163
LAURA: No, spiritual weapon stays up, so it's
right there. For your bonus action, you can attack again.

02:27:54.229 --> 02:27:58.063
BRIAN: Okay, then who should I hit, guys?

02:27:58.063 --> 02:27:59.412
SAM: The spider!

02:27:59.412 --> 02:28:01.335
BRIAN: I'll hit the spider.

02:28:01.335 --> 02:28:04.811
LAURA: All right. Roll for attack.

02:28:04.811 --> 02:28:06.723
TALIESIN: I believe in you. You can hit things.

02:28:06.723 --> 02:28:13.069
LIAM: Come on, Brian and Bryan.

02:28:13.575 --> 02:28:16.019
BRIAN: That's an 11.

02:28:16.019 --> 02:28:20.875
LAURA: That doesn't hit. That's okay, your
calculator is really cool looking.

02:28:20.875 --> 02:28:22.211
BRIAN: Thank you.

02:28:22.211 --> 02:28:25.179
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy! Thanks for the save, though.

02:28:25.179 --> 02:28:34.349
LAURA: All right, up is the son. He's going to
attack Ally once more. All right, that's a nine,

02:28:34.349 --> 02:28:37.517
so 15.

02:28:37.517 --> 02:28:39.821
LIAM: Hits.

02:28:39.821 --> 02:28:44.518
BRIAN: I forgot to ask you: weed for a month for
healing you.

02:28:44.518 --> 02:28:45.574
TRAVIS: Weed?

02:28:45.574 --> 02:28:46.995
BRIAN: You must give me weed for a month.

02:28:46.995 --> 02:28:48.488
SAM: You smoke?

02:28:48.488 --> 02:28:53.863
BRIAN: Occasionally, I like to smoke and listen to
Dr. Stephen Hawking.

02:28:53.863 --> 02:28:58.950
LAURA: 13 points of damage against Ally.

02:28:58.950 --> 02:29:00.073
LIAM: Got it.

02:29:00.073 --> 02:29:02.549
TRAVIS: 13 points?

02:29:02.549 --> 02:29:08.101
SAM: Of all the scientists, that would not be the
one I would pick out to listen to.

02:29:08.101 --> 02:29:11.429
LAURA: And make a constitution saving throw.

02:29:12.975 --> 02:29:14.525
LIAM: 16.

02:29:14.525 --> 02:29:22.225
LAURA: Oh, you succeed. All right, Bunder. Newly
revived, you are up.

02:29:22.225 --> 02:29:33.009
TRAVIS: (panting) I fucking hate chess. I'm more
of a checkers guy. I'll cast Fireball, my last

02:29:33.009 --> 02:29:36.374
3rd-level spell, right at the king.

02:29:36.374 --> 02:29:37.693
LIAM: Big finish.

02:29:37.693 --> 02:29:42.129
TRAVIS: Yeah. You have to make a dex save of 16.

02:29:43.735 --> 02:29:45.521
LAURA: Oh, big fail.

02:29:45.521 --> 02:30:00.098
TRAVIS: Nice! 8d6. (counting) 28.

02:30:00.098 --> 02:30:06.611
LAURA: The king burns up and falls to its side.
All of the pieces on the chess board kneel down

02:30:06.611 --> 02:30:10.917
and bow to you.

02:30:10.917 --> 02:30:12.681
SAM: And the spiders too?

02:30:12.681 --> 02:30:14.591
TALIESIN: No, probably not.

02:30:14.591 --> 02:30:17.515
TRAVIS: We have a move?

02:30:17.515 --> 02:30:19.648
LAURA: There's no moves!

02:30:19.648 --> 02:30:24.124
TRAVIS: I'll just go here (sizzling).

02:30:24.124 --> 02:30:28.684
LAURA: I like it. Use your wands, I like that. All
right, Claire.

02:30:28.684 --> 02:30:33.228
SAM: I'll move up and around towards this spider.
Is this the last spider?

02:30:33.408 --> 02:30:40.191
BRIAN: There's one, two, three. There's two babies
and a biggie.

02:30:40.191 --> 02:30:43.713
LIAM: Concentration check. Was that what the con
was for or something else?

02:30:43.713 --> 02:30:45.012
LAURA: The constitution saving throw.

02:30:45.012 --> 02:30:51.413
LIAM: I need to make a concentration check. It was
13 points of damage, and it'll be a ten, right?

02:30:51.413 --> 02:30:53.554
LAURA: Oh, for your lightning storm, yeah.

02:30:53.554 --> 02:30:56.798
LIAM: Yeah, to hold it up. Natural 20.

02:30:56.798 --> 02:31:02.268
LAURA: It's good that you remembered.

02:31:02.268 --> 02:31:06.005
SAM: I'll move up towards the spider.

02:31:06.005 --> 02:31:08.040
LAURA: Which one? This one?

02:31:08.040 --> 02:31:10.240
SAM: Yeah, the big one.

02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:16.744
LAURA: So you were here. Ten, 20, you can get up
there.

02:31:16.744 --> 02:31:18.877
SAM: Oh, that one gets an attack of opportunity,
though.

02:31:18.877 --> 02:31:22.229
LAURA: Yeah, the swarm of spiders attacks you as
you walk away from it, but that's okay. It's just

02:31:22.229 --> 02:31:27.664
a little swarm, it's no big deal. That's a ten to
hit?

02:31:27.664 --> 02:31:28.747
SAM: Fails!

02:31:28.747 --> 02:31:32.088
LAURA: Ooh, okay.

02:31:32.088 --> 02:31:42.962
SAM: I will cast-- oh shit, I'll hit something
else, won't I? Oh well. I'll cast Dragon's Breath.

02:31:43.018 --> 02:31:45.879
LAURA: Holy shit.

02:31:45.879 --> 02:31:56.377
SAM: With lightning damage, we'll say. A 15-foot
cone. They have to save with a dex 14.

02:31:56.377 --> 02:31:59.033
LIAM: Isn't it that way?

02:31:59.033 --> 02:32:00.982
LAURA: Oh, natural 16!

02:32:00.982 --> 02:32:11.485
SAM: Oh no, but I think I still get half damage.
Ooh, good roll. 15 points, so halved, seven points

02:32:11.485 --> 02:32:19.336
of damage to both spiders and probably the
spiritual weapon and probably one of our pawns.

02:32:19.336 --> 02:32:24.028
LAURA: That's fine. You don't need the pawn. It
doesn't fucking matter. Wait, so seven points, you said?

02:32:24.174 --> 02:32:28.149
SAM: Seven points to the spider who saved. What
about the other spider?

02:32:28.149 --> 02:32:30.137
LAURA: They have to make a save?

02:32:30.137 --> 02:32:32.078
SAM: Yeah, 14.

02:32:32.078 --> 02:32:33.239
LAURA: They fail.

02:32:33.239 --> 02:32:35.872
SAM: Okay, so that's 15 points of damage to that
spider.

02:32:35.872 --> 02:32:37.898
LAURA: Swarm of spiders (scuttling).

02:32:37.898 --> 02:32:43.831
SAM: Yeah! I'm breathing lightning on you! Wow.
Greased lightning!

02:32:43.831 --> 02:32:46.629
LAURA: All right, Andy, you're up.

02:32:46.629 --> 02:32:53.329
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up to that big spider
and I'm going to smack him.

02:32:53.329 --> 02:32:56.448
LAURA: You fly in and you attack him with your
club.

02:32:56.448 --> 02:32:59.157
TALIESIN. The first one is a ten.

02:32:59.157 --> 02:33:00.447
LAURA: All right, that doesn't hit.

02:33:00.447 --> 02:33:06.043
TALIESIN: All right, let's fire up the swing
again. 21.

02:33:06.043 --> 02:33:07.850
LAURA: 21 hits!

02:33:07.850 --> 02:33:18.068
TALIESIN: All right, I lose my big hit, but that's
okay. That's 12 points of damage.

02:33:18.068 --> 02:33:22.410
LAURA: 12 points of damage, all right.

02:33:22.410 --> 02:33:28.893
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn an extra action, so I
get another action, which is two more attacks, I

02:33:28.893 --> 02:33:31.399
believe. I'm going to take two more attacks.

02:33:31.399 --> 02:33:33.689
LAURA: All right.

02:33:33.689 --> 02:33:37.789
TALIESIN: That's a miss and 16.

02:33:37.789 --> 02:33:39.243
LAURA: 16 hits.

02:33:39.243 --> 02:33:47.706
TALIESIN: Okay, one more hit. That's nine points
of damage. I'm whaling on him.

02:33:47.706 --> 02:33:54.193
LAURA: He looks like he's hurting a bit. Bunder,
it is now your turn.

02:33:54.193 --> 02:33:55.914
TRAVIS: Is it?

02:33:55.914 --> 02:33:59.976
LAURA: Just kidding, I was looking at spiders.
Never mind. It's Ally's turn.

02:33:59.976 --> 02:34:04.244
LIAM: Okay, the storm is still roiling and I'm
still swiveling the wand and (crashing) down on

02:34:04.244 --> 02:34:11.734
the big spider. That is another save it has to
make. What kind? It's a dex, 15.

02:34:13.058 --> 02:34:15.020
LAURA: Oh, it's a fail.

02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:18.820
TRAVIS: Would you say it's been thunderstruck?

02:34:21.189 --> 02:34:27.074
LIAM: That's a total of 16 lightning damage.

02:34:27.074 --> 02:34:37.654
LAURA: Whoa! 16 points of damage. Oh my gosh. Let
me do my math here. All right.

02:34:37.654 --> 02:34:40.323
SAM: Is it looking pretty rough?

02:34:40.323 --> 02:34:41.520
LAURA: It's looking pretty rough.

02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.384
SAM: (squealing)

02:34:43.384 --> 02:34:47.632
TALIESIN: This is like the end of It right now.

02:34:47.632 --> 02:34:48.470
LAURA: Bryan.

02:34:48.574 --> 02:34:52.175
BRIAN: Hey bruv, I'd like to--

02:34:52.905 --> 02:35:01.411
TRAVIS: I cast Dispel Magic on your fucking
accent.

02:35:01.411 --> 02:35:09.363
BRIAN: I'd like to move right up to that spider
and, just to be sure this goes well, I would like

02:35:09.363 --> 02:35:12.301
to do Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level.

02:35:12.721 --> 02:35:14.796
LAURA: Oh my god!

02:35:16.291 --> 02:35:18.496
BRIAN: Melee spell attack.

02:35:18.761 --> 02:35:21.098
LAURA: Yeah, make an attack hit.

02:35:21.098 --> 02:35:22.624
BRIAN: Attack plus--

02:35:22.624 --> 02:35:24.672
TALIESIN: Spell attack modifier.

02:35:24.672 --> 02:35:25.583
TRAVIS: Plus eight.

02:35:25.583 --> 02:35:26.489
BRIAN: 18 plus eight.

02:35:26.489 --> 02:35:27.875
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that definitely hits.

02:35:27.875 --> 02:35:33.442
BRIAN: Okay, then in that case, Miss Dungeon Mistress,
let's go ahead and do--

02:35:33.442 --> 02:35:34.665
LAURA: That's 5d10.

02:35:34.665 --> 02:35:35.884
BRIAN: 5d10.

02:35:35.884 --> 02:35:38.227
SAM, TRAVIS, and LIAM: Oh!

02:35:38.227 --> 02:35:50.720
BRIAN: Luckily, I have five of them here with
me. (counting) 29.

02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:57.054
LAURA: Yeah. These spiders are
just guts. Guts everywhere splattering up to these

02:35:57.054 --> 02:35:58.469
pawns in these--

02:35:58.469 --> 02:36:00.053
TRAVIS: Not bad, dweeb. Not bad.

02:36:00.053 --> 02:36:02.711
BRIAN: Thank you, I've been practicing.

02:36:02.711 --> 02:36:11.896
LAURA: All right. We're back up to
Son of Aragorg! Going to spin around here and

02:36:11.896 --> 02:36:17.437
attack Andy since he did so much damage to
him.

02:36:17.437 --> 02:36:19.729
TALIESIN: That's fine. I have an AC of-- oh no.

02:36:19.729 --> 02:36:21.238
LAURA: Ooh. Yeah, that's a natural
19.

02:36:21.238 --> 02:36:22.686
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. That hits.

02:36:22.686 --> 02:36:36.756
LAURA: That's a bite attack. That'll do 16 points of piercing
damage and I need you to make a constitution

02:36:36.756 --> 02:36:39.458
saving throw.

02:36:39.458 --> 02:36:42.897
TALIESIN: Ugh! 11?

02:36:42.897 --> 02:36:48.292
LAURA: Ooh! That is what you needed to hit
so that means I hit you with poison damage.

02:36:48.292 --> 02:36:49.805
TALIESIN: I might be out.

02:36:49.805 --> 02:36:51.028
TRAVIS and BRIAN: No.

02:36:51.028 --> 02:36:52.228
LAURA: Ten points of poison damage.

02:36:52.228 --> 02:36:53.410
TALIESIN: I am not out!

02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:56.918
TRAVIS: Yeah! Smytherpin!

02:36:56.918 --> 02:37:03.361
LAURA: For bonus action, he's moving-- this is
the last swarm of spiders. (skittering)

02:37:03.361 --> 02:37:04.780
SAM: (screams)

02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:06.399
LAURA: They're going to come over to Claire and
try to attack her again.

02:37:06.399 --> 02:37:07.881
SAM: (screams)

02:37:07.881 --> 02:37:09.347
LAURA: So they're going to bite at you.

02:37:09.347 --> 02:37:10.656
SAM: I don't like this.

02:37:10.656 --> 02:37:12.002
LAURA: Natural one.

02:37:12.002 --> 02:37:17.499
SAM: I don't-- Spiders are beneath me.

02:37:17.499 --> 02:37:21.477
LAURA: They can smell the amount of perfume
that you're wearing and it does not attract them.

02:37:21.477 --> 02:37:27.503
SAM: Everything I learned aout my character
I learned by looking at the poster. I think she's

02:37:27.503 --> 02:37:29.683
uppity. I don't know anything about--

02:37:29.683 --> 02:37:31.987
LAURA: Bunder, you're up.

02:37:31.987 --> 02:37:42.709
TRAVIS: Oh, I am up? Amazing. That's crazy. I will cast
Agana-- Agazzna-- Yeah, no! The scorcher!

02:37:42.709 --> 02:37:45.260
At the big spider-der.

02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:46.489
LAURA: Spider-der?

02:37:46.489 --> 02:37:49.505
TRAVIS: Yep. Dex save of 15.

02:37:49.505 --> 02:37:52.724
LAURA: Ooh! It succeeds.

02:37:52.724 --> 02:38:02.649
TRAVIS: Shit. All right, so you take half of (counting) 15,
so seven. Seven points of damage.

02:38:02.649 --> 02:38:08.281
LAURA: Ooh, yeah. He is looking really rough here.

02:38:08.281 --> 02:38:11.575
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'll wink at Claire.

02:38:11.575 --> 02:38:16.912
SAM: (gasp) With my bonus action,
I get a little moist.

02:38:16.912 --> 02:38:19.401
BRIAN: Goddamn it!

02:38:19.401 --> 02:38:22.792
LAURA: All right, that was your bonus action.
What's your action, Claire?

02:38:22.792 --> 02:38:26.764
BRIAN: We couldn't get through one--

02:38:26.764 --> 02:38:29.418
TALIESIN: One. Just one.

02:38:29.418 --> 02:38:33.422
BRIAN: Look. I'm gouging my eyes out with my wand.

02:38:33.422 --> 02:38:35.769
SAM: Oh, those aren't real glasses, are they?

02:38:35.769 --> 02:38:38.382
BRIAN: Movie magic, friends.

02:38:38.813 --> 02:38:40.129
LAURA: What would you like to do,
Claire?

02:38:40.129 --> 02:38:52.410
SAM: I still have whatever my spell was-- Dragon's Breath
up! It lasts! I'm going to (belches) again right on the thing.

02:38:52.410 --> 02:38:53.534
LAURA: Out your mouth?

02:38:53.534 --> 02:38:55.295
BRIAN: Are you sure your moistness
isn't going to affect the flames?

02:38:55.295 --> 02:38:56.872
SAM: Lightning comes out of my mouth.

02:38:56.872 --> 02:38:57.787
LAURA: Wow.

02:38:57.787 --> 02:39:00.840
SAM: So it has to make a dex 14 save.

02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:02.872
LIAM: Molly Ringwald belching lightning.

02:39:02.872 --> 02:39:04.324
TRAVIS and BRIAN: Yep.

02:39:04.324 --> 02:39:05.793
LAURA: That does save with 15.

02:39:05.793 --> 02:39:08.714
SAM: Oh well. Ugh.

02:39:08.714 --> 02:39:10.627
LAURA: Probably won't matter.

02:39:10.627 --> 02:39:11.931
SAM: Three points of damage.

02:39:11.931 --> 02:39:17.567
LAURA: Three points of damage is enough!
How do you want to do this, Claire?

02:39:17.567 --> 02:39:26.502
SAM: I want to angle the blast so that when the
spider explodes and splatters, it splatters towards

02:39:26.502 --> 02:39:32.265
our little Ally over here and gets all chunky
in her hair.

02:39:32.265 --> 02:39:36.270
LAURA: Ugh, guts just explode. You're covered
in red and purple and

02:39:36.270 --> 02:39:42.370
black guts, Ally. It goes with your motif though.
It looks good with your outfit.

02:39:42.370 --> 02:39:43.836
TRAVIS: Mixes in with the dandruff.

02:39:43.836 --> 02:39:46.081
LAURA: Yeah. All right.

02:39:46.081 --> 02:39:47.348
LIAM: I turn into a badger.

02:39:47.348 --> 02:39:48.561
SAM: Oh wait. There's spiders behind me.

02:39:48.561 --> 02:39:52.458
LAURA: Yeah, but it's not their turn. Andy?

02:39:52.458 --> 02:40:00.537
TALIESIN: Tempted to just wait and let it just work
itself out. Yeah, I'm just going to saunter

02:40:00.537 --> 02:40:02.118
over to the spider.

02:40:02.118 --> 02:40:03.087
TRAVIS: Just the one?

02:40:03.087 --> 02:40:03.706
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:40:03.706 --> 02:40:06.209
LAURA: It's a little swarm. It's a swarm of spiders.

02:40:06.209 --> 02:40:08.822
TALIESIN: I'm not even going to break
eye contact. I'm just going to swat at it without

02:40:08.822 --> 02:40:10.917
breaking eye contact.

02:40:10.917 --> 02:40:12.511
LAURA: All right, roll with disadvantage.

02:40:12.511 --> 02:40:13.476
TALIESIN: Fine.

02:40:13.476 --> 02:40:14.802
SAM: Oh, nice!

02:40:16.167 --> 02:40:17.810
TALIESIN: 19.

02:40:17.810 --> 02:40:19.648
LAURA: Oh my god!

02:40:19.648 --> 02:40:21.270
TRAVIS: Not even scared.

02:40:21.270 --> 02:40:22.261
LAURA: Ridiculous!

02:40:22.261 --> 02:40:23.625
LIAM: Typical Smytherpin.

02:40:23.625 --> 02:40:25.817
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Nice job, sporto.

02:40:25.817 --> 02:40:28.902
TALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage.

02:40:28.902 --> 02:40:31.826
LAURA: Yeah, these spiders are just
squished.

02:40:31.826 --> 02:40:34.902
SAM: Man! The Sorting Mat got it right with you.

02:40:34.902 --> 02:40:37.417
LAURA: Wow.

02:40:37.417 --> 02:40:39.662
SAM: I don't know! I'm trying to talk--

02:40:39.662 --> 02:40:42.210
LAURA: As you all stand there taking in--

02:40:42.210 --> 02:40:50.510
LIAM: Actually, Ally uses a bonus
action to turn into a badger and grapples Claire

02:40:50.510 --> 02:40:53.704
to the ground to roll the funk all over her.

02:40:53.704 --> 02:40:55.445
SAM: Ah!

02:40:55.445 --> 02:40:56.658
LAURA: Make an attack roll.

02:40:56.658 --> 02:40:58.292
SAM: No! My fine clothes!

02:40:58.292 --> 02:41:00.953
BRIAN: Now you're moist and funky.

02:41:00.953 --> 02:41:05.166
LIAM: Oh, it's a badger attack. Hold on.
Creatures. That's an eight. Super low.

02:41:05.166 --> 02:41:06.716
SAM: Oh no, I have--

02:41:06.716 --> 02:41:07.797
LIAM: Does it hit the AC?

02:41:07.797 --> 02:41:08.633
SAM: I'm okay.

02:41:08.633 --> 02:41:09.834
LIAM: So she dances out of the way?

02:41:09.834 --> 02:41:14.581
LAURA: Now you just run up and you stand up and you put
your paws on her shoulders and you look at each

02:41:14.581 --> 02:41:17.724
other face to face. Claire to badger eyes.

02:41:17.724 --> 02:41:19.479
SAM: What are we doing?

02:41:19.479 --> 02:41:21.259
LIAM: Is it Sixteen Candles now?

02:41:21.259 --> 02:41:23.703
TRAVIS: I cast Friends and they make out!
No, I'm just kidding.

02:41:23.703 --> 02:41:30.187
SAM: What are we doing? I'm sorry that I splattered
spider guts all over you. That was wrong of me.

02:41:30.187 --> 02:41:33.073
TRAVIS: You just killed Taliesin.

02:41:33.073 --> 02:41:35.388
BRIAN: Can I do something?

02:41:35.388 --> 02:41:36.982
SAM: We're not so different, you and me.

02:41:36.982 --> 02:41:38.034
LAURA: What would you like to do?

02:41:38.034 --> 02:41:40.917
BRIAN: Can I cast Command on her and make her grovel?

02:41:40.917 --> 02:41:43.023
LAURA: You can certainly try.

02:41:43.023 --> 02:41:44.968
TRAVIS: Ooh.

02:41:44.968 --> 02:41:47.519
TRAVIS and BRIAN: What is it?

02:41:47.519 --> 02:41:49.341
BRIAN: It's a wisdom 16.

02:41:49.341 --> 02:41:50.999
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not going to go well.

02:41:50.999 --> 02:41:53.977
SAM: Nine plus five?

02:41:53.977 --> 02:41:55.732
LIAM: You have advantage on wisdom saves.

02:41:55.732 --> 02:41:57.721
LAURA: That's true because he cast Beacon of Hope!

02:41:57.721 --> 02:41:58.807
BRIAN: Oh!

02:41:58.807 --> 02:42:00.358
TRAVIS: One more chance!

02:42:00.358 --> 02:42:02.577
SAM: It's tons.

02:42:02.577 --> 02:42:10.627
LAURA: You succeed. You start to cast Command on her
and then you think better of it. You start to realize

02:42:10.627 --> 02:42:17.248
that, you guys, you succeeded in something pretty
major together from all different walks of life.

02:42:17.248 --> 02:42:22.792
SAM: Yeah. You don't have to Command me.
I'll grovel anyway. I know I was a bitch to you guys

02:42:22.792 --> 02:42:29.940
before and it's only because I really just, deep down,
want to fit in. Also, side note: I'm a virgin.

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:37.042
I read that on Wikipedia during the break. Thought I
should admit that to you now.

02:42:37.042 --> 02:42:41.384
TRAVIS: I have an unhappy home life. I do care
about things.

02:42:41.384 --> 02:42:48.145
BRIAN: My parents forced me to get good grades.

02:42:48.145 --> 02:42:50.355
SAM: What about you, jock?

02:42:50.355 --> 02:42:52.650
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I think we're all
just really messed up--

02:42:52.650 --> 02:42:55.258
SAM: And you, honey badger?

02:42:55.258 --> 02:42:58.489
LIAM: The badger is peeing down the front
of your--

02:42:58.489 --> 02:43:03.858
SAM: You know? I told you we weren't so different.

02:43:03.858 --> 02:43:12.021
LAURA: As all of you sit and talk to
each other, Beetle pops back in. "Oh, Beetle

02:43:12.021 --> 02:43:13.202
"thanks you--"

02:43:13.202 --> 02:43:13.949
TRAVIS: Avada!

02:43:13.949 --> 02:43:20.771
LAURA: "Beetle thanks you. Thank you! The school
is saved! Here, quickly! Make it up to your classroom.

02:43:20.771 --> 02:43:23.940
"I will try to distract the Professor before she
gets back."

02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:28.806
TRAVIS: Do you have a plortbee or do we
have to run back?

02:43:28.806 --> 02:43:30.088
SAM: A what?!

02:43:30.088 --> 02:43:33.876
LAURA: "Run! You cannot apparate within the school.
Run as fast as you can!"

02:43:33.876 --> 02:43:35.232
TALIESIN: I'm pretty fast.

02:43:35.232 --> 02:43:37.656
TRAVIS: All right, yeah. Double dash. Haul our ass
back upstairs.

02:43:37.656 --> 02:43:39.115
LAURA: Haul ass back to the classroom?

02:43:39.115 --> 02:43:42.506
TRAVIS: Yeah. (running noise)

02:43:42.506 --> 02:43:44.283
TALIESIN: Now it becomes Ferris Bueller.

02:43:44.283 --> 02:43:47.951
LAURA: Yeah, right? As you guys come
flying up the stairs--

02:43:47.951 --> 02:43:50.938
SAM: I will literally come flying up the stairs.
I cast Fly.

02:43:50.938 --> 02:43:52.784
LAURA: Oh, I like it.

02:43:52.784 --> 02:43:54.164
SAM: I grab a broom!

02:43:54.164 --> 02:44:02.083
LAURA: Yes, you fly up your stairs. You pass by the cat again
and Mrs. Blilch, the groundskeeper. I don't remember

02:44:02.083 --> 02:44:09.990
what I said. They stare at you as you fly up. You
fly up across the moving staircases. You all are running.

02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:15.385
LIAM: Yeah, and we have that one moment
where they skid around the floor around the corner.

02:44:15.385 --> 02:44:21.231
LAURA: Yeah, definitely. You do that. You
run up the staircases. Make an acrobatics check as

02:44:21.231 --> 02:44:27.337
all of you try to jump to the next level except
for you, Claire.

02:44:27.337 --> 02:44:29.119
TALIESIN: 21.

02:44:29.119 --> 02:44:30.320
TRAVIS: 13.

02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:31.682
LIAM: 14.

02:44:31.682 --> 02:44:35.393
BRIAN: Eight.

02:44:35.393 --> 02:44:40.649
LAURA: All of you run and jump. Bryan starts to fall.
Does any of you save him?

02:44:40.649 --> 02:44:45.761
SAM: I have a feature where if he's
in danger, because he's my ward, I can switch

02:44:45.761 --> 02:44:48.004
places with him.

02:44:48.004 --> 02:44:51.855
LAURA: What?! That's so cool! Really?

02:44:51.855 --> 02:44:55.417
SAM: Yeah. I think he has to be close to me, but I don't
really know where we're placed.

02:44:55.417 --> 02:44:57.247
LAURA: Yeah, you're close. Sure. Whatever.

02:44:57.247 --> 02:44:58.957
SAM: I will switch places with him--

02:44:58.957 --> 02:45:00.086
BRIAN: Oh wow.

02:45:00.086 --> 02:45:03.837
SAM: Which will put him in the air?

02:45:03.837 --> 02:45:05.324
LAURA: That'll put him safely across.

02:45:05.324 --> 02:45:06.268
SAM: Sure.

02:45:06.268 --> 02:45:08.540
LAURA: You're flying now. So you're where he was?

02:45:08.540 --> 02:45:09.440
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:15.223
LAURA: You fly up and you guys are heading up the
hallway. Quickly, you pass by your level one

02:45:15.223 --> 02:45:18.821
spells class. You can hear, down the other
hallway, the footsteps of Professor Furbin.

02:45:18.821 --> 02:45:20.187
TRAVIS: Furbin.

02:45:20.187 --> 02:45:26.576
LAURA: Do you try to make it across the hallway
and into the classroom before she sees you?

02:45:26.576 --> 02:45:27.513
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:45:27.513 --> 02:45:28.649
LIAM: I cast Pass Without a Trace!

02:45:28.649 --> 02:45:29.849
BRIAN: I cast Silence.

02:45:29.849 --> 02:45:32.907
LAURA: Oh! Everybody roll stealth and with
advantage because of that.

02:45:32.907 --> 02:45:34.891
LIAM: Plus ten with advantage.

02:45:34.891 --> 02:45:36.682
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:45:36.682 --> 02:45:38.648
TALIESIN: Thank god!

02:45:38.648 --> 02:45:39.602
TRAVIS: 31.

02:45:39.602 --> 02:45:40.203
BRIAN: 23.

02:45:40.203 --> 02:45:40.860
SAM: 22.

02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:42.017
LIAM: Jesus, so bad. 15.

02:45:42.017 --> 02:45:43.494
LAURA: Plus ten?

02:45:43.494 --> 02:45:44.942
LIAM: Yeah. Rolled a two and a three.

02:45:44.942 --> 02:45:45.847
TALIESIN: 25.

02:45:45.847 --> 02:45:50.977
LAURA: It's okay. Everybody else did really well,
so you guys slide into the classroom, run for it,

02:45:50.977 --> 02:45:58.821
and take your seats at the desks in just enough
time to hear the door turning and Professor Furbin

02:45:58.821 --> 02:46:06.575
walks in. She stares at all of you. "I'm glad to
see you haven't moved from your seats like I

02:46:06.575 --> 02:46:14.313
"asked." She walks up the stairway, goes into her
office, giving you just enough time--

02:46:14.313 --> 02:46:16.938
SAM: To write an essay?

02:46:16.938 --> 02:46:22.074
LAURA: To write this and leave it on your desk
before all of you leave.

02:46:22.074 --> 02:46:23.956
BRIAN: I don't read.

02:46:23.956 --> 02:46:28.681
LAURA: No, you're supposed to read it, Brian!
Jesus Christ! Watch the fucking Breakfast Club!

02:46:28.681 --> 02:46:35.916
BRIAN: (terrible British accent) "Dear Professor Furbin,
we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a day in--"

02:46:35.976 --> 02:46:37.208
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:46:37.208 --> 02:46:40.257
SAM: "Soh-crifice?!"

02:46:40.257 --> 02:46:47.559
BRIAN: "We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice
a day in Schmogsmeade to be in detention. I mean,

02:46:47.559 --> 02:46:55.060
"what we did was pretty shady, but we think you're
crazy to have us write an essay telling you who we

02:46:55.060 --> 02:47:05.816
"think we are. You see us as you want us to see us.
In the simplest of terms, the most convenient

02:47:05.816 --> 02:47:09.772
"definitions, but what we've discovered--"

02:47:09.772 --> 02:47:14.073
LAURA: I'm sorry I made him read it. I'm sorry.

02:47:14.073 --> 02:47:21.140
BRIAN: "Is that each one of us is a brain, an
athlete, a honey badger--"

02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:23.270
SAM: An "oth-lete?!"

02:47:23.270 --> 02:47:40.065
BRIAN: "A princess, and a criminal. Also, we're
pretty tits at killing spiders. Does that answer

02:47:40.065 --> 02:47:44.763
"your question? Sincerely yours, the Club of
Misfits."

02:47:44.763 --> 02:47:48.272
ALL: Yeah!

02:47:48.272 --> 02:47:52.546
TRAVIS: Hold that freeze frame!

02:47:52.546 --> 02:47:55.347
LAURA: And we're out.

02:47:55.347 --> 02:47:57.866
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Yeah! Laura!

02:47:57.866 --> 02:48:00.728
LAURA: Yeah! Good job, you guys.

02:48:00.728 --> 02:48:02.438
BRIAN: That was so fun.

02:48:02.438 --> 02:48:04.689
SAM: It had spiders. It had chess.

02:48:04.689 --> 02:48:09.495
TRAVIS: It had wizard's chess. Holy shit! Oh my
god.

02:48:09.495 --> 02:48:13.476
SAM: This makes me want to go read Schmarry
Schmopper.

02:48:13.476 --> 02:48:16.400
LAURA: Read some Shmarry Shmotter and watch The
Breakfast Club.

02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:18.726
TRAVIS: How was it? How was your first one shot?

02:48:18.726 --> 02:48:20.203
LAURA: That was terrifying.

02:48:20.203 --> 02:48:21.516
TRAVIS: DM seat.

02:48:21.516 --> 02:48:22.625
LAURA: I think--

02:48:22.625 --> 02:48:25.749
SAM: How long did it take you to prep? Days?
Hours? Minutes?

02:48:25.749 --> 02:48:31.034
LAURA: Days. Days of prep and then all of it goes
just goes "Ah!" in the moment, right?

02:48:31.034 --> 02:48:32.319
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:48:32.319 --> 02:48:34.862
LAURA: Hard to sleep beforehand thinking about
everything that's going to happen.

02:48:34.862 --> 02:48:38.910
BRIAN: Did you consult the dungeon master, Matthew
Mercer VO?

02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:45.422
LAURA: I did. I gave him a phone call and he
helped me out some and I also used my D&D Beyond.

02:48:45.422 --> 02:48:51.232
I looked up a lot of monster stats and everything
like that. I got all these pieces of paper.

02:48:51.232 --> 02:48:53.457
TRAVIS: How much of an inspiration was your son,
Ronin?

02:48:53.457 --> 02:48:56.314
LAURA: Oh, just so much. He was the king that--

02:48:56.314 --> 02:48:58.213
BRIAN: That we destroyed?

02:48:58.213 --> 02:49:02.705
LAURA: No, that was on our side. Yeah, sure.
Whatever.

02:49:02.705 --> 02:49:05.570
BRIAN: He was the king you fireballed.

02:49:05.570 --> 02:49:07.078
LAURA: You guys were great.

02:49:07.078 --> 02:49:09.383
TRAVIS and BRIAN: You were great!

02:49:09.383 --> 02:49:13.345
LAURA: This was fun. It was really fun. It was
really just an excuse so we can all dress up in

02:49:13.345 --> 02:49:14.840
these outfits.

02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:16.085
TRAVIS: Happy "Harroween!"

02:49:16.085 --> 02:49:17.539
LAURA: "Harroween!"

02:49:17.539 --> 02:49:24.193
SAM: If you're in England, we'll see you tomorrow
or the next day?

02:49:24.193 --> 02:49:27.375
BRIAN: Saturday-Sunday so yeah, we'll see you
Saturday and Sunday.

02:49:27.375 --> 02:49:31.028
TALIESIN: We have to check to see if your passport
has been revoked for that accent.

02:49:31.028 --> 02:49:34.765
BRIAN: Nope! No way! I am going to spend the
weekend in Heathrow, my friends!

02:49:34.765 --> 02:49:38.801
LIAM: There was England; Australia; New Zealand;
Schenectady, New York.

02:49:38.801 --> 02:49:41.677
BRIAN: I want everyone to feel included.

02:49:41.677 --> 02:49:45.142
SAM: "Oth-letes."

02:49:45.142 --> 02:49:53.209
LAURA: All right. I guess tune in next week and
see what happens with Mighty Nein and until then,

02:49:53.209 --> 02:49:57.000
love each other and is it Thursday yet?

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:03.622
(cheering)

02:50:03.622 --> 02:50:06.466
BRIAN: Oh, drippy balls.

02:50:07.466 --> 03:02:48.184
