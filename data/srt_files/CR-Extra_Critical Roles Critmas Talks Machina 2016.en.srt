1
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:08,746
BRIAN: Good evening! Welcome to a very special
episode of Talks Machina: The Critmas episode!

2
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:20,496
I am your host, Brian Wayne Foster, and my guests
tonight include this guy, this guy, this girl,

3
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:32,524
this guy, that girl, and this guy. All that and
more tonight on Talks Machina. Hit it, Denise.

4
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:52,542
(Talks Machina intro music)

5
00:00:54,482 --> 00:01:05,465
BRIAN: Well, folks. It's that time of year again,
where we pick up the pieces of what we spilled the

6
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:17,462
year before. Sometimes you have to sweep it under
the rug. Sometimes that rug is bearskin-colored.

7
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:21,444
Sometimes-- are we really just going?

8
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:25,718
(laughter)

9
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,710
SAM: Marisha caught in flagrante delicto!

10
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,451
BRIAN: She's going after the presents underneath
the tree.

11
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,695
MARISHA: Keep Christmas going!

12
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,478
LAURA: Critmas! Say it right.

13
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,848
SAM: Praise be to Jesus Crit.

14
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:45,513
BRIAN: Guys. How is everybody doing?

15
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:47,447
LAURA and MATT: Good, how are you?

16
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:49,725
BRIAN: Wonderful. Merry Critmas, everyone.

17
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:52,446
SAM and LAURA: It's the holiday season.

18
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:57,791
SAM: We've got gifts. We've got the spirit of
Christmas. There's a light snowfall. When we were

19
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,432
driving up, did you guys see that?

20
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:03,454
TALIESIN: That was ash, something was on fire.

21
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:07,518
BRIAN: Yeah, so the Warner Brothers tower was
being drizzled with snow.

22
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:10,459
TRAVIS: Drizzled?

23
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,054
BRIAN: We'll cut it out.

24
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:14,221
(laughter)

25
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,770
BRIAN: Is the music too loud, Denise?

26
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,804
SAM: Yes.

27
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,162
DENISE: No.

28
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:21,440
SAM: Don't you sass me, Denise.

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,718
(laughter)

30
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:32,249
BRIAN: When she has spoken, she has spoken. It's
over after that. Tonight, we're going to do

31
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:39,433
Critmas on the show. There's not going to be a
Critical Role on Thursday the 22nd. Instead, we're

32
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:45,748
going to open our Critmas presents and hang out,
just have fun, and towards the end of the episode,

33
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:50,733
we're going to play our What Does Critical Role
Mean To You? videos that you guys have sent in, so

34
00:02:50,733 --> 00:03:00,460
stick around for that. Yes, very excited! Before
we get going, I didn't have time to send in a

35
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:10,253
video, because I missed the deadline. Instead, I'm
going to read my Critmas letter to you.

36
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:11,738
LAURA: Oh no.

37
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,695
LIAM: Batten down the hatches!

38
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,202
BRIAN: What do you mean, Oh no?

39
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:20,202
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. Can I repour my glass of
wine that spilled at the very top of the episode?

40
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:24,137
BRIAN: You absolutely can. Matt? How was your
week?

41
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:32,201
MATT: My week was crazy. I'm looking forward--

42
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,200
BRIAN: I'm looking forward.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,650
MATT: Yeah, not backward, but that direction. No.
Yeah. Hi.

44
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:48,058
BRIAN: Did you see Marisha pop into his frame for
a second, then pop back out?

45
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:49,471
(laughter)

46
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:53,406
LIAM: Marisha, if you've finished up in there, you
can also dust in the dining room, and the

47
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,722
bathrooms need to be cleaned as well.

48
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:59,457
SAM: Is that a knock at the door?

49
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:00,760
TRAVIS: Uncle--

50
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,981
SAM: --David Bowie? I don't know.

51
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,166
TALIESIN: Nice, but too soon.

52
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:11,232
MARISHA: Are you trying to save this episode? It's
too early to save this episode.

53
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:19,061
BRIAN: We could totally start over, but the
shittiness of this fits the last five episodes so well.

54
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,498
TALIESIN: We're on brand right now.

55
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:24,239
BRIAN: We are hashtag on brand.

56
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:27,742
BRIAN: Like I said, I wasn't able to send in a
video, because I missed the deadline, but I did

57
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:31,240
write you guys a Critmas letter that I'm going to
read to get us started.

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,425
TALIESIN: Is it in screenplay format?

59
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:34,672
BRIAN: It is not.

60
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:36,094
TALIESIN: Damn.

61
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:41,717
BRIAN: But I am translating it from Latin. It
says, "Guys--" That's the Latin word for friends.

62
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:44,454
(laughter)

63
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:49,691
BRIAN: "Guys, we all know 2016 had its fair share
of ups and downs. For instance, an example of a

64
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:56,683
down moment would be every moment before there was
a Talks Machina. To contrast that, an example of

65
00:04:56,683 --> 00:05:03,750
an up moment would be every moment after there was
a Talks Machina. This holiday season, I'm thankful

66
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,690
for every single one of you guys. Ashley."

67
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,456
(laughter)

68
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:16,696
BRIAN: "Matt, Marisha--" These aren't in any
particular order, I promise.

69
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:18,285
TRAVIS: You better say my name next.

70
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:34,534
BRIAN: "Travis, for sure, Liam, Laura, Taliesin's
on here, Denise, Amandine's on here, Eddie, Max,

71
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:41,447
and Sam-- times when I think about Critical Role and
my Critical Role family, a single trait sticks out

72
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:48,485
in my mind: their kindness. For instance, they
were kind enough to offer me this job by sending a

73
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:55,455
courier to my house to hand-deliver me a note.
Surely, they must have been overwhelmed with work,

74
00:05:55,455 --> 00:06:02,467
auditions, parenting, and insurance fraud-- Sam.
Surely, they did not send a courier because this

75
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:07,713
news seemed too unimportant to deliver personally.
No, I mean, there's only eight of them."

76
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:12,550
LAURA: Did we really send a courier?

77
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,389
TRAVIS: Laura!

78
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:23,295
BRIAN: "I took it as an act of kindness. That
evening, at dusk, I sat in front of my house,

79
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:28,450
holding that note, almost afraid of its contents.
There, among the stray cats and drifters, I

80
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,152
finally gathered the strength to read that note. I
held it close to the barrel fire I had just cooked

81
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:44,150
my dinner over, and I opened the note. The first
thing I noticed was it was quite short. The second

82
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:50,208
thing I noticed about this note offering me the
job was that it wasn't even handwritten. But that

83
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:59,507
night, my life would change, for the note read,
very simply, "Hardwick passed. You're up. Travis."

84
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:02,477
(laughter)

85
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:03,926
TALIESIN: So true.

86
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:06,692
TRAVIS: Listen, I have illegible writing.

87
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,890
BRIAN: But thank you, guys. Years from now, when
I'm living off the money I make at conventions in

88
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:16,444
Paraguay and robbing the elderly, I'll be
grateful. I'll always remember where I got my

89
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:26,185
start. My first gig. That gig was the gig I do
after my contract here is up. Please contact my

90
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:35,194
reps for hosting opportunities after the 31st of--
we'll just say later. But thank you, Critical

91
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:39,491
Role, for the opportunity to ask you guys
questions about yourselves."

92
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,700
(cheering and laughter)

93
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,227
SAM: It's what the Critmas spirit is all about.

94
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:45,484
BRIAN: Cheers, guys.

95
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:50,194
TALIESIN: Next, our musical guests, the Stray
Cats. I'm excited that you happen to know them.

96
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,752
BRIAN: Taliesin, big fan of the Stray Cats. Okay,
let's begin.

97
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,707
SAM: What are we doing?

98
00:07:57,707 --> 00:08:00,076
LAURA: Is this where we start opening things? What
are we doing?

99
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:04,408
BRIAN: Let's open things. Oh, we're going to play
the intro?

100
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,665
MATT: Yeah, roll the opening for the opening.

101
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:09,202
BRIAN: Yeah. Let's roll the wrong clip of Sam.

102
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,151
(laughter)

103
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:13,480
TRAVIS: Is there ever a wrong clip of Sam?

104
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,458
TALIESIN: Is there ever a right one?

105
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:19,474
BRIAN: How does this work? You grab them, and we
talk about who sent them out?

106
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:25,227
TALIESIN: Usually, we talk amongst ourselves.

107
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,689
LAURA: I want Marisha to put some nail wraps on
me.

108
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:32,470
MARISHA: We just figured we could have a classic
Critmas powwow.

109
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,489
SAM: Maybe we should go around the room while
we're opening and just say one thing we're

110
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:37,721
grateful about.

111
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:41,237
TRAVIS: God, I'm going to barf all over you. Do
not make us do this shit.

112
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:44,473
SAM: How about we say one thing that we like about
Brian?

113
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,464
TRAVIS: That's even harder.

114
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:52,729
BRIAN: At least you won't have to worry about
taking up too much time.

115
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,472
SAM: You want to go first, Travis?

116
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:59,497
MARISHA: I like that, and then a hard cut to
Christmas gifts we opened.

117
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,677
(laughter)

118
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:05,485
BRIAN: All right, let's begin. I'm ready.

119
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:12,194
MARISHA: I, for one, appreciate that Travis's
letter got to you before the restraining order did.

120
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:16,712
MATT: That's true. You were able to head that one
off at the pass.

121
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:19,495
MARISHA: A little bit of backpedalling on our
part.

122
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:26,142
BRIAN: There's a P.S. to that story, by the way.
The courier's name? Was fucking Glenn.

123
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:28,528
TRAVIS: Yeah.

124
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:31,490
MATT and LAURA: God damn it, Glenn.

125
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,591
BRIAN: It was Glenn, guys. Anyway, keep going.

126
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,723
(laughter)

127
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:40,957
BRIAN: For anyone who has not seen the show,
they're like--

128
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:43,502
MARISHA: The fuck?

129
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:48,504
LAURA: What I like about you, Brian, is that the
first time you came-- well, I guess it wasn't the

130
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:54,440
first time. The first time you came to set after
you got this job? You made us all Old Fashioneds

131
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,475
during Critical Role.

132
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:57,675
BRIAN: I did.

133
00:09:57,675 --> 00:10:00,731
LAURA: You make a mean Old Fashioned, and I wish
that kept going.

134
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:05,711
BRIAN: I'm here every Thursday. I could keep doing
it. The only problem is they're quite tasty and

135
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:15,186
then by half-time, maybe, everybody could be a
little drippy. We'll just limit to four hours? You

136
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:20,377
could do two. Do one at the break. That's a good
enough amount of time.

137
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:22,837
MATT: Don't look at me! I'm not allowed to drink
during any of the games.

138
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,826
BRIAN: You drink, what is that? Tang?

139
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:29,363
MARISHA: By the way, that's a self-imposed rule.
No one else puts that on him.

140
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:34,144
MATT: No. I have way too much to concentrate on
every time we do an episode. I can't drink.

141
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,554
MARISHA: Still a self-imposed rule.

142
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:37,860
BRIAN: Ladies and gentlemen, french horns are
back.

143
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:46,093
MATT: What I like about Brian, is Brian is brave
enough, and bold enough, to bring the french horns

144
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,817
back for the holiday season.

145
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:51,375
(cheering)

146
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,371
SAM: Please don't turn them off. Oh, okay.

147
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,753
TRAVIS: That's not french horns.

148
00:10:54,753 --> 00:11:00,271
LIAM: I'm thankful for the day that you showed me
a video from the wedding of me when I barely knew

149
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:06,539
you, walking by, and me scowling or grimacing at
you. You see this? Here, I'm going to walk by and

150
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,672
watch what you do.

151
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,825
MARISHA: Did you do that?

152
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:14,046
LIAM: I don't remember it.

153
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:17,742
BRIAN: Yeah, I walked by, and he was like--

154
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:21,117
LIAM: That was probably a reaction to your skinny
pants and my admiration/envy.

155
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:26,291
BRIAN: They were skinny back then, too. I was like
a size zero. Yeah.

156
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:30,069
MATT: Now you're a size hero.

157
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:31,132
(laughter)

158
00:11:31,132 --> 00:11:32,487
TALIESIN: This is why we don't let him drink.

159
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:35,539
BRIAN: I make the shitty jokes on this show!

160
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:37,468
MATT: Sorry.

161
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:38,844
BRIAN: I make the jokes that people hate.

162
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:48,414
SAM: I admire the fact that you've overcome your
handicap, which we all know is that he's smooth

163
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:56,980
down there. It's like a Ken doll. There's no
genitalia. It's just shiny and plastic. It's just,

164
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:03,809
there's nothing. Just nothing there. But you've
somehow overcome that and had a relatively normal

165
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:04,899
life.

166
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:15,805
BRIAN: Nothing I can say. Right now, I can see
tweets, I can see Tumblr, I can see Reddit, I can

167
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:18,542
see people showing up at my house, so I'm just
going to say thank you, Sam.

168
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,030
TALIESIN: I can see fan art, weirdly.

169
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,629
BRIAN: I can see fan art. I'm just going to say
thank you.

170
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:32,681
TRAVIS: I am thankful for your ability to wear the
top button of your collared shirt closed, whether

171
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,565
you're wearing a tie or not.

172
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:39,369
BRIAN: Thank you. I do not know how to tie a tie,
however.

173
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,112
TRAVIS: Is that a clip-on?

174
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:42,301
TALIESIN: That's a clip-on.

175
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:46,192
BRIAN: Denise had to tie my tie tonight.

176
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:49,382
LAURA: She did a good job. I mean, it's a
little--

177
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:56,257
BRIAN: I crawled in here, and I said, "Denise, I'm
so sorry for how I've treated you." And she said,

178
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,667
"I'm so sorry, remind me who you are, again?"

179
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,517
(laughter)

180
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:03,241
MARISHA: Do you have a key card?

181
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,038
BRIAN: Didn't pass the background check.

182
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:06,730
(laughter)

183
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,528
BRIAN: Nope. Someone tagged me in a Reddit thing
today, and they were like, "I love how shady Brian is."

184
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,738
(laughter)

185
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,090
TALIESIN: That was my compliment!

186
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:22,753
MATT: Please tell me that's on your business card:
"Brian Wayne Foster. Shady."

187
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:27,306
TALIESIN: It's more of a, "Meet me out back."
That's all it says. "Meet me out back."

188
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:33,023
BRIAN: Yeah, I could totally give those out to
girls at bars. "Meet me out back." Nobody's going

189
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,500
to think anything of it.

190
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,798
LAURA: You definitely shouldn't do that. You
shouldn't be hitting on girls at bars.

191
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:39,357
TRAVIS: It's on his LinkedIn profile.

192
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:44,479
BRIAN: I sell shirts out of my van. You know that.
People are always coming out to my car.

193
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:49,492
TALIESIN: It says, "Meet me out back." And on the
other side of the card, it says, "Steak house."

194
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:55,280
Meet me at the out back, steak house. It's great. It's a
terrible joke. I feel bad for making it.

195
00:13:56,524 --> 00:14:02,701
BRIAN: So five days until Christmas, and then ten
days until New Years, from tonight.

196
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:04,653
SAM: Yeah, from tonight! Because it's the 20th.

197
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:07,964
BRIAN: Christmas from tonight. Tuesday, December
20th--

198
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,585
SAM: Is right now.

199
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:12,567
BRIAN: The night of our lord, Tuesday.

200
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,285
SAM: We've had the Thordak fight.

201
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:17,409
LIAM: We just rolled all our new characters
yesterday.

202
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,421
SAM: It was a crazy night.

203
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:22,111
LAURA: It didn't go at all how I expected.

204
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:27,013
SAM: In a way, though, it was fitting. It was a
fitting end.

205
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,024
LAURA: I thought so, too.

206
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:35,264
TALIESIN: The Scanlan/Grog love interest thing, I
was not prepared for that. It was really--

207
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:41,569
BRIAN: Okay, here's my top three moments from the
Thordak episode: Taliesin rolled very well.

208
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:42,576
TALIESIN: I did.

209
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:47,995
BRIAN: These were the things that surprised me:
Taliesin rolled very well. Sam knows a lot more

210
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,394
Melissa Etheridge songs that we all thought.

211
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:52,223
TALIESIN: And we thought he knew a lot!

212
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:59,008
BRIAN: And we thought he knew a karaoke binder's
width. Number three-- this was a weird one.

213
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,744
Marisha got blamed for some shit.

214
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:07,420
(laughter)

215
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,844
SAM: Did not see that coming.

216
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:11,105
TRAVIS and BRIAN: Thanks, Keyleth.

217
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:13,693
LIAM: That's not the internet I know.

218
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:15,624
TALIESIN: Not today. Not here.

219
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:21,482
MARISHA: I'm hoping for some of that to change in
2017. Bright new future.

220
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:25,405
BRIAN: Oh, you know what? Since our last episode,
if you haven't been here-- Travis hasn't been here

221
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:33,300
since the first episode. We lifted the boycott.
He's back. Hey, last week on the show, a week

222
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,326
ago--

223
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:35,951
TRAVIS: You got to fill me in, because I don't
watch this shit.

224
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:40,411
BRIAN: I wouldn't either. Don't like the host. A
week ago tonight, Will Friedle was on the show.

225
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:41,487
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

226
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:45,989
BRIAN: He threw some shade down about your
Cowboys, and my Cowboys, and Laura's Cowboys, and

227
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:47,774
my uncle Bill's Cowboys.

228
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:48,593
TRAVIS: Yeah, I heard.

229
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:50,093
BRIAN: Yeah, he's a Deflatriots fan.

230
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,586
TRAVIS: No, I know, it's okay, He lives really
close to us. I visited him that night.

231
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:56,057
BRIAN: This is now your time, this is your-- Equal
time, right?

232
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,334
LAURA: Is this bear pelt?!

233
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:58,536
BRIAN: Sorry, Trinket.

234
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:04,381
TRAVIS: Yeah. I stood in front of his dark
bedroom, breathing heavily, and then put my hand

235
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:10,997
over his now-wife's mouth, and said, "Shh, it's
time for a conversion therapy session. You will

236
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:15,639
love the Cowboys." And he said, "No, I don't want
to, I don't want to love winners, Tom Brady is the

237
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,309
best." I-- is nobody else following what I'm--

238
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,464
TALIESIN: No, I'm so delighted, we're all on
board, keep going.

239
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,456
LIAM: We're talking about the Old West, right?

240
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:25,924
TRAVIS: Yeah.

241
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:27,068
MARISHA: I thought we were talking about Mike
Pence.

242
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,188
MATT: I thought we were talking about Knock
Knock.

243
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,044
TRAVIS: Yes. Yeah, that's it.

244
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:33,656
LAURA: Let's open presents.

245
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:37,847
MATT: Let's. Please. Open presents. Please.

246
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,773
MARISHA: Yeah, let's open presents.

247
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,568
SAM: How are we going to do this? Someone go and
get them.

248
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:44,611
LAURA: I got some on the end.

249
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:48,582
SAM: I hear a jingle of hooves on the roof.

250
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:50,736
BRIAN: Oh my goodness, it's the FBI.

251
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:52,894
LAURA: Where's the presents?

252
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:55,893
TALIESIN: Ho ho ho, hands on the ground.

253
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,907
(laughter)

254
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:01,623
TALIESIN: Trying to make it festive.

255
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:03,836
BRIAN: Bag those two, for sure.

256
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:06,187
TRAVIS: Just bring anything.

257
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:08,655
TALIESIN: Somebody was cooking meth this year.

258
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:16,733
BRIAN: Sam is sponsoring this episode of Talks
Machina.

259
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,042
SAM: I'm sponsoring this episode?

260
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:22,034
BRIAN: Who decided to sponsor our December 20th
episode of Talks Machina?

261
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:28,780
SAM: I have no idea. This is your show. I'm
actually-- I'm still stunned that we pay you for

262
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,262
this.

263
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:32,236
LAURA: This is for Critical Role.

264
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:35,770
BRIAN: That's interesting to learn myself. I was
not aware of it.

265
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,819
LIAM: I have a present for the group from Scott
McLean.

266
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,044
MARISHA: Scott McLean.

267
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,519
SAM: Oh, it's fragile.

268
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:48,463
(paper rustling)

269
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,360
BRIAN: Let's trash this place.

270
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,113
MARISHA: Yeah!

271
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,317
LAURA: This is just-- What is it?

272
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,904
LIAM: I don't know yet.

273
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,299
LAURA: It's a circle.

274
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:01,036
LIAM: It's a dragon!

275
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:02,630
MATT: Whoa!

276
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,460
LIAM: There's a Bigby's Hand.

277
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,291
LAURA: Bigby's Hand, they are all made out of
paper.

278
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,765
SAM: But it's not paper mache?

279
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:14,183
LAURA: No, it's straight-up paper.

280
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:18,011
TRAVIS: How did that not get crushed?

281
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:23,107
MATT: That's really fucking nuts.

282
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:25,907
LIAM: Those are beautiful.

283
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:27,375
LAURA: Those are awesome.

284
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,652
SAM: Those are great, thank you.

285
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:29,624
LIAM: Scott McLean.

286
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:41,049
LAURA: I've got something from... There's no
name!

287
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,025
SAM: Just open it. We need to keep going.

288
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:46,925
LIAM: Maybe there's a note inside.

289
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,739
BRIAN: Someone get a close-up on Taliesin,
Denise.

290
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:59,631
LAURA: Travis. Me. Liam. Marisha. And Sam.

291
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:01,189
LIAM: And there's a little note.

292
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:04,298
LAURA: And Matt, and the rest of the cast. Sorry,
Taliesin.

293
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:06,459
SAM: The rest of the cast is just Taliesin.

294
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,908
TALIESIN: Matt and me.

295
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:14,399
LIAM: These are from James Hoelscher, or
tazman5296 in chat on Twitter.

296
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,214
LAURA: How did you know?

297
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:21,871
LIAM: Oh, he sent my boots of haste?

298
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,191
MARISHA: Yeah, he sent that ivy circlet that I
used to have.

299
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,608
LAURA: Oh, the arrows!

300
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:30,733
MATT: His brother and him also made donations to
the Prescott chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters.

301
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,054
BRIAN: Oh, that's great. That?s really cool.

302
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:37,516
SAM: What have we got? What is this stuff? Tiny
things.

303
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,538
TRAVIS: He says he's sent stuff before.

304
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:44,416
LAURA: That is awesome.

305
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,752
LIAM: Thank you.

306
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:50,982
MARISHA: Oh yeah, it's like the spiritual
successor to Three Wolf Moon.

307
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,948
BRIAN: Oh my God, that's glorious.

308
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,654
LIAM: We are going camping in these shirts.

309
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,898
MARISHA: We are so going camping.

310
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,873
MATT: That's a tough-looking bear.

311
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:03,038
LIAM: Is the bear wearing a torc?

312
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,911
LAURA: He is, it's like if he got awakened.

313
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:12,501
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure all my shirts could kick
your shirts' ass.

314
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,612
SAM: (high-pitched whistle) I got reeds for my
shawm.

315
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:22,518
BRIAN: It's a flute the size of Scanlan's penis.

316
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:23,990
LIAM: It's the wrong shape.

317
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,947
LAURA: Thank you, James! Sorry about that.

318
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:32,562
TRAVIS: If you pass out, I hope you'll still be
blowing it.

319
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:34,661
LAURA: All right.

320
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:38,495
TRAVIS, LAURA and MATT: Thank you, James.

321
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,562
BRIAN: We'll cut that out.

322
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:44,681
SAM: This is going to be heavily edited. The final
file is just going to be six minutes long.

323
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:46,509
BRIAN: It's going to be everybody going, "Hey
guys, cut."

324
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:49,430
LIAM: More shirts from Rebecca Sidenburger.

325
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,787
LAURA: She's Ryuti76 in the chat.

326
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,627
BRIAN: Is what? Say it again, please?

327
00:20:57,627 --> 00:20:59,666
LAURA: Ryuti76 in chat.

328
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:06,207
LIAM: (singing) I'm the one holding the shirts so
I get to find the right size. They're shirts

329
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:07,223
made--

330
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:09,425
LAURA: Oh, because she made them!

331
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:13,179
LIAM: Yeah. She designed them, it's the D&D symbol
with our names.

332
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,614
LAURA: This is so cool!

333
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:17,937
MATT: That's really cool!

334
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:20,900
SAM: How many shirts are there?

335
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,939
LIAM: A lot.

336
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:23,849
LAURA: She did her thesis on Critical Role.

337
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,243
SAM: Wait, what? Was this a high school thesis or
a college thesis?

338
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:30,242
LAURA: No, she graduated with a BFA in graphic
design, dude.

339
00:21:30,242 --> 00:21:32,452
SAM: She did her thesis on us?

340
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:33,478
LAURA: Yeah!

341
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,726
SAM: She got a C+.

342
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,726
TALIESIN: She passed. It was a pass/fail class.

343
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:43,690
LIAM: Gang, gang, gang. The smallest sizes are
mediums so the ladies will be getting the mediums.

344
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,329
LAURA: Thank you.

345
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:47,726
LIAM: You also take the one for Ash.

346
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:50,704
LAURA: She says she's sorry if they aren't the
appropriate sizes. She wanted them to be a

347
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:51,914
surprise so she had to guess.

348
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:56,705
BRIAN: What's a BFA? I have a BFF.

349
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:58,515
LAURA: Is it me? Is it me?

350
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:06,763
TALIESIN: Can we let them know that we got their
letter? Can I say it? This is a lovely letter from

351
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:16,089
tazman5296. Dude, thank you so much. Thank you so
much for the Big Brothers Big Sisters.

352
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,415
LAURA: That is so sweet! Thank you, Rebecca.

353
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:22,677
LIAM: I think we're shy one unless I missed one in
the box.

354
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:25,046
SAM: I've got to get one, got to have one.

355
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:26,580
LIAM: Let me see.

356
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,449
LAURA: These are a good size.

357
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,830
TALIESIN: Everyone knows she'll cut them up.

358
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,433
LAURA: Thank you!

359
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:40,509
BRIAN: No. No. Denise! She tricked me!

360
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:41,679
LAURA: What?

361
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,059
BRIAN: Nothing, it's fine. Travis saw it.

362
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:50,239
LAURA: Oh wow, look at all these things over here!
What is this?

363
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:53,550
TRAVIS: Go, fire it up!

364
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,776
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

365
00:22:54,776 --> 00:23:04,474
SAM: This is from a Critter named AmniClerk
@Stories_nDreams. It's an embossed Critical Role-y

366
00:23:04,474 --> 00:23:08,230
card that she made. It says, "May the happiness of
family, the joys of friendship, and the warmth of

367
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,413
love surround you this season. Also, fuck you,
Brian." That's weird.

368
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:15,199
BRIAN: Oh my god.

369
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:17,749
LIAM: That's so strange.

370
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:21,667
SAM: "For all the love and support you've given
myself and the rest of the Critter legion, thank

371
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,234
you, Happy Winter's Crest and beyond." And inside
are--

372
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,135
TALIESIN: Whoa, oh my god.

373
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:33,374
SAM: Oh wait, they light up. They might be
ornaments.

374
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:35,217
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they're so pretty.

375
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:39,545
SAM: They do light up, they've got dice on them,
they look handmade. They're amazing. One for Matt.

376
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,104
Liam. Taliesin.

377
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:45,825
TALIESIN: Aw! I got a blue one.

378
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:48,114
MATT: They're little ornaments! Oh my god!

379
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:49,452
BRIAN: Let's put them on the tree!

380
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:50,717
LAURA: I'm going to put Ashley's on the tree.

381
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:52,061
BRIAN: Put Ashley's on the tree.

382
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,602
SAM: Are they ornaments?

383
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:54,704
MATT: They're ornaments.

384
00:23:54,704 --> 00:24:01,175
SAM: It's an ornament, okay, good. I'm going to
put this on my tree, tonight.

385
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:02,990
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

386
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,229
LIAM: Aw, thank you.

387
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:05,152
MATT: Thank you!

388
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:11,821
TALIESIN: Oh look, it has a little Percy. What
great penmanship. Sorry, that was my immediate

389
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:12,759
thought.

390
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,388
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Hold on, hold on.

391
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:18,470
SAM: Also, I think there's some gifts here for the
crew. They're like blue screens of death.

392
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,495
TALIESIN: Wow!

393
00:24:19,495 --> 00:24:21,241
BRIAN and TALIESIN: Oh my god.

394
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:23,914
TALIESIN: Oh my god. That is so cool.

395
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:25,713
MATT: That is amazing.

396
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:32,647
SAM: It says "Twitch has returned error, the
universe broke. Please reboot." And it says

397
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:33,543
#WeKnow.

398
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:38,448
BRIAN: Yeah, Taliesin has his hand out.

399
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:40,839
TALIESIN: I have my hand out. I know, it's gone.

400
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,157
MARISHA: We know! Oh my god it says #WeKnow.

401
00:24:43,157 --> 00:24:51,897
TALIESIN: #WeKnow! Oh, that's so good. Clever!
That's amazing!

402
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,731
BRIAN: Is that underwear, Liam?

403
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:59,148
MARISHA: Thanks for keeping us streaming.

404
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:02,480
SAM: Where do we put crew gifts, guys?

405
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,816
BRIAN: I'll take them.

406
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,406
LAURA: Can I just open these chocolates, though?

407
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,373
SAM: Yeah, keep going. I want to eat some!

408
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,416
TRAVIS: It's like carnival music.

409
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:14,453
LAURA: I know, this music is really messed up
right now.

410
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:18,895
BRIAN: This is a fan-favorite music. I'll have you
know the French horns are the biggest thing to

411
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:20,523
happen to this show since Sam was on.

412
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:23,261
LAURA: Oh my god! I wanted to open the
chocolates-- I thought they were for all of us,

413
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:25,210
but it's just to me.

414
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,347
TALIESIN: Wow, you're going to have to show us
that letter to make sure that's true.

415
00:25:29,347 --> 00:25:35,171
LAURA: "Dear Laura. Last year, when Matt read that
I like the dark chocolate truffles with Baileys

416
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:40,057
filling, yours and Marisha's eyes indicated your
interest. Therefore I address this box to you to

417
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:42,704
share with the entire cast and crew."

418
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:44,961
(laughter)

419
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:48,214
MARISHA: Did you hear her disappointment that she
had to share it with me?

420
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,693
LAURA: "I tried to donate to each person's
individual charity over the course of the year."

421
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,447
That's wonderful.

422
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:58,021
LIAM: She's a greedy bastard.

423
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:02,517
LAURA: It's from Paul Nelson, and he's claiming to
be the official Critical Role forensic consultant.

424
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,456
I don't know why, but he is.

425
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:06,017
MATT: Awesome!

426
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:08,884
TALIESIN: Does that mean he gets to cut us open
when one of us finally dies?

427
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:11,494
BRIAN: It's weird that he saw that in your eyes,
because all I see is darkness.

428
00:26:11,494 --> 00:26:13,179
LAURA: Thanks, Paul Nelson!

429
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:19,444
LIAM: "Dear Critical Role, as an avid viewer of
the show, and an occasional viewer of Matt and

430
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:24,963
Marisha's Critmas periscopes, I seem to remember
Marisha mentioning her love of leggings. My wife

431
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:33,107
is a LuLaRoe consultant, her shop can be found on
Facebook, and offered to send in a few pairs of

432
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:38,216
leggings for the ladies." You can keep doing that,
I don't mind, but massage if you're going to do

433
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:44,184
it. These are six-- No, my ears, man. Six sets of
leggings. Pick one.

434
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:45,760
LAURA: They're soft, Marisha!

435
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,190
MARISHA: Are they comfy?

436
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,872
LAURA: Ooh, I want these ones!

437
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:51,514
LIAM: Remember that two are for Ashley.

438
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:54,146
SAM: Wait, there's six, and two of them are for
Ashley?

439
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,425
MARISHA: She's not here, right?

440
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:56,863
LIAM: That's true. That is true.

441
00:26:56,863 --> 00:27:02,719
TALIESIN: She's probably watching, though. Not
right now, because it's not live.

442
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:05,775
LIAM: What's good for Ashley? Ashley, which one's
good for you?

443
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:06,929
BRIAN: You could ask her boyfriend!

444
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,505
LAURA: I feel like these are good for Ashley.

445
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:10,092
TALIESIN: I feel like those are actually good 
for Ashley

446
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:12,157
BRIAN: Those are good, also any of the other
ones.

447
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:14,491
TALIESIN: The corduroy patches.

448
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:17,366
BRIAN: She would take anything.

449
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:33,411
MARISHA: This is from Kane Velante, and she says,
avid member of our show and all of the artistic

450
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:38,682
masterpieces that people-- I don't want to read
the whole letter because of time, but they

451
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:44,009
basically gave new minis to Grog and--

452
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:50,686
LIAM: Yeah, these are good too! Look at that. It
looks just like you!

453
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:52,755
TRAVIS: Wow!

454
00:27:52,755 --> 00:28:00,953
LIAM: It's got wings, motherfucker! Thank you!

455
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:06,680
TALIESIN: That's true, I've been waiting for a
"and then I fly away." We haven't had a "and then

456
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,225
I fly away."

457
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:15,637
LIAM: Guys, can we see him? This is legit.

458
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:17,605
TRAVIS: It's pretty good, yeah, it's pretty
great.

459
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:25,625
BRIAN: Hey, I have something here! Yeah, it's from
my probation officer. No, I'm just kidding. Oh, it

460
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:30,293
says "Liam." Liam, there's a note for you.

461
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,124
LIAM: Is it from my second family in Nevada?

462
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:39,700
BRIAN: Hold on, let me skim through this. It
says-- oh, you left your lights on outside.

463
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,709
LIAM: Oh, thanks.

464
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:45,443
BRIAN: Oh, I know, I'm going to give this to Liam.

465
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:47,395
SAM: It is for Liam.

466
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:53,169
BRIAN: Yep, hold on, it's rubber-banded. "Don't go
drinking with hobbits."

467
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:54,678
LIAM: No promises.

468
00:28:54,678 --> 00:29:00,826
BRIAN: With lyrics by people whose names I can't
pronounce. And they sent this rubber band for Marisha.

469
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,088
MARISHA: Oh thanks, dude!

470
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:07,262
BRIAN: They sent this for-- is that the
audiobooks? Is that what it is, CDs? Hold on,

471
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:10,527
please accept these items as a token of my--

472
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:16,228
LIAM: "Stunning dramatized BBC production of
Tolkien's classic is presented in 13 hours on 13

473
00:29:16,228 --> 00:29:21,445
compact discs. Starring Ian Holm, and featuring a
cast of 25 performers, specially composed music

474
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:25,710
and sound effects, in this beautifully packaged
box said to be the perfect gift for every Tolkien

475
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,772
fan." That's me!

476
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:31,679
BRIAN: This is from Jean Dewey, a.k.a.
elenoirproudfoot, thank you so much.

477
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,540
MARISHA: Bailey's truffle. That's what I want.

478
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,847
LIAM: That looks so cool, thank you! Can I see the
letter?

479
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:39,646
BRIAN: Yes, that's for you. I was just going to
hand that to you.

480
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:40,940
TRAVIS: I got one!

481
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,903
SAM: Oh, Travis has one!

482
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:46,383
TRAVIS: "There isn't enough space to convey my
thoughts, I am a novice Critter right now with

483
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:49,376
hopes that I'll speed up to speed soon. Please
accept this small token of appreciation with the

484
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:55,517
warmest, awesome members of Critical Role. Warm
regards, Aaron." It is a DVD copy of Critters.

485
00:29:55,517 --> 00:30:01,545
SAM: Oh, the classic movie.

486
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:06,442
TRAVIS: I actually did creature noises, and-- nah,
I'm going to shut up.

487
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:08,146
SAM: You were ten.

488
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:11,362
TRAVIS: I know. I'm a liar and a thief.

489
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:19,287
TALIESIN: Wow! I think my mom may have worked on
one of those, too. Of course she did.

490
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:20,507
TRAVIS: Critters 3? Yeah.

491
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:22,852
TALIESIN: Yeah, it sounds like something my mom
would do. I'll double-check.

492
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:23,953
LAURA: Who's opening next?

493
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:32,911
TALIESIN: I've got one from Joe White at RPGenius,
which is a 3D-printing company. He and his team

494
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:37,308
apparently listen to us to pass the time as
they're working on all their cool miniatures that

495
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:44,037
they make. He said apparently we increase their
productivity. And then he sent me-- which is good.

496
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:51,704
Work. Work harder! They sent Percy an in-game
letter, which is really spectacular, from a

497
00:30:51,704 --> 00:31:00,667
citizen of Whitestone who was a tinkerer of his
own. I'll put some quotes up later. He said that

498
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:05,759
he sent-- this is a prototype of something they've
been working on, and this is the only one they'll

499
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,074
making of this scale.

500
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,704
TRAVIS: What the heck?

501
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:12,484
TALIESIN: But they sent a prototype of something.

502
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:13,946
SAM: It's a gun.

503
00:31:13,946 --> 00:31:15,616
LAURA: Oh my--

504
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:23,887
(exclamations of awe)

505
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:26,221
TALIESIN: And it has a scope.

506
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:31,734
SAM: Does it spin?

507
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:35,197
TALIESIN: Probably not, because it's 3D-printed,
but I don't know. Actually, I'm going to find out.

508
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:41,116
I need to reassemble the scope at some point.
Let's find out if it-- no, it's designed to look

509
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,747
like it spins but actually-- oh my god!

510
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:46,406
MARISHA: That's been engraved.

511
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,610
TALIESIN: Yeah, in fact, that would work really
well--

512
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,424
TRAVIS: TSA won't have a problem with that at
all.

513
00:31:51,424 --> 00:31:55,041
TALIESIN: No, TSA, they won't be like last time!
This will not be like last time.

514
00:31:55,041 --> 00:32:01,323
BRIAN: And here's the deal, too. Also, so we're
aware going forward because I got this note handed

515
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:08,200
to me from one of the producers. "Any gifts opened
on the set can be chosen as set pieces by the

516
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,194
host." So what it says here is starting with
Taliesin's gun and then any of the gifts

517
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:21,663
afterwards. It's a very long explanation. Article
two, paragraph three. Laura, find a good home for

518
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:23,445
that tonight on the set.

519
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:27,145
LAURA: You got it. You got it, BFF. Whatever you
need.

520
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,744
TALIESIN: Oh, it needs a little leather strap,
too. I want to do some stuff to it.

521
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:32,033
TRAVIS: (singing) A little leather strap is what
it needs!

522
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:40,342
MARISHA: This is from Melanie Gurran and she sent
us seaglass that she has collected from the shores

523
00:32:40,342 --> 00:32:53,445
of Washington that is apparently lucky, and if
we-- Taliesin. She said that they're lucky stones

524
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:56,698
so that if we put them in our dice bag, maybe it
would bring us good luck.

525
00:32:56,698 --> 00:33:00,460
LAURA: I like it even though she put Raishan on
the freaking packaging!

526
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,443
MARISHA: Oh, Laura part two, because she knows.

527
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:07,675
LAURA: (gasps) Really? Oh, she does know! Never
mind, she's the best.

528
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:10,165
MARISHA: And this is for Ashley--

529
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:12,139
TALIESIN: What piece of music is this?

530
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:14,491
SAM: Oh, thank you! What did we get?

531
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,677
BRIAN: That's playing right now, Liam. No, I mean,
Taliesin?

532
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:23,482
TALIESIN: No, there's sheet music on the back of
the card.

533
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:28,882
TRAVIS: I read music. My tune actually goes
(imitates guitar riff)

534
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,056
LAURA: That was nice, baby.

535
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:32,867
SAM: That was from Splash.

536
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:37,748
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can see it right there. That's
my sheet music. You follow along in

537
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:41,693
three-quarter-eighteenth's time in a D-minor major
chord.

538
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:44,431
TALIESIN: I'm so excited by it.

539
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:49,493
SAM: We also have a stack of letters here, which
we're going to have to read off-stream. There's

540
00:33:49,493 --> 00:34:07,376
one from Jennifer Griffey, Joshua Luczac, Lena
Hox, Megan Levon, Paige Megelly, Nicholas McGuire.

541
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:13,448
And this one, which I think Liam needs to read.

542
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:22,372
LIAM: Lieber Matt Mercer und die gesamte Critical
Role crew. Ich heiße Daniel-- That means "I am

543
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:29,394
Daniel." Bin dreiundzwanzig. Komme aus
Deutschland. Oh, he's from Germany. Und sehe eure

544
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:37,506
Serie regelmäßig. I'm saying a lot of this wrong,
but I'm saying a lot of it right! Leider nicht--

545
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:43,493
Oh, you lost me. Die Serie ist großartig. Sie
hat-- I'll just read it to myself.

546
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:45,497
SAM: And it goes on like that!

547
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:52,447
TALIESIN: I can hear the sound of one subscription
being lost in the Twitch channel going (ping).

548
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:57,904
LIAM: Die wohl beste RPG show gestoßen dieses...
something.

549
00:34:57,904 --> 00:35:00,339
TALIESIN: I followed some of that!

550
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,692
LIAM: Es gibt Critical Role. Matt, ganz im Ernst.

551
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,803
TRAVIS: Und Grog is the best.

552
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:08,265
LAURA: I see my name.

553
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:14,674
LIAM: Besonders Laura Bailey. Yeah, this says
everyone is good except Laura Bailey. Sorry.

554
00:35:14,674 --> 00:35:17,624
LAURA: Stop reading this letter.

555
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:22,515
LIAM: You can't read it! I took three years of
high school German, goddamn it!

556
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:26,277
MARISHA: That so qualifies you to be reading
that.

557
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:29,519
SAM: I think he made a donation to UNICEF on our
behalf.

558
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,378
(cheering)

559
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:33,719
TRAVIS: UNICEF donation!

560
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:55,192
LAURA: Donation! Can I open one? This is from
Kristen Twammy? It is packets. This is for Grog.

561
00:35:55,192 --> 00:36:02,760
This is for Liam. This is for-- it's ink and a
feather. What do you think, is this Matt?

562
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,541
TRAVIS: Oh, it's packets of tea!

563
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:13,721
LAURA: There's Pike. There's Percy. There's me.
There's Scanlan. There's Marisha. So it is for

564
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,300
Matt!

565
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,192
LIAM: I was close. It wasn't except for Laura,
it's <i>especially</i> Laura.

566
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:22,521
LAURA: Oh, it's all in English, too!

567
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:25,559
SAM: No oolong?!

568
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,330
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Somebody didn't do their
homework!

569
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:35,935
LAURA: Wait, there is a ton in here! Maybe you got
oolong in that. Thank you so-- oh, wait, they sent

570
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:49,272
another thing. What is this? This is pretty. Oh,
it's a long letter. She's from Boston.

571
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:51,193
SAM: (Boston accent) She's from Boston.

572
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:54,115
TALIESIN (German accent): This is how we say
goodbye in Boston, Dr. Jones.

573
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:57,316
TRAVIS: I love the Last Crusade reference.

574
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,685
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you.

575
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:00,658
LAURA: What is this?

576
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:03,826
SAM: Fine art photography of some sort.

577
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:07,761
LAURA: She did photography of our characters.
Look, Percy.

578
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:09,191
TALIESIN: That's so cool!

579
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:11,394
LIAM: Hey, Daniel, your English is very good.

580
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:18,131
LAURA: Can you see that? It's a really cool
photograph. Its got feathers and a braid there,

581
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:20,080
that there.

582
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:26,561
TRAVIS: Paige Weggle sent me a packet of mayo!

583
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:28,948
SAM: Oh that's funny, a packet of mayo!

584
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:32,540
MATT: (laughter) We haven't opened it yet! You
have to open the mayo.

585
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,932
LAURA: Oh, don't!

586
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:36,492
BRIAN: They sent mayonnaise?

587
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:38,084
LAURA: They sent you mayonnaise.

588
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:40,654
TRAVIS: Just a packet of mayo and a whole
envelope.

589
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:42,703
(laughter)

590
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:47,209
TRAVIS: It says, "I couldn't resist. Happy
Critmas," but it's just this in this whole thing.

591
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,737
(laughter)

592
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:58,721
MATT: I have a really cool letter here from Thomas
Dunwoody, who writes about how we helped him

593
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:04,158
through his deployment and missing his friends and
family, the show helped him get through that and

594
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:10,091
he looks forward to hopefully meeting us at a
Denver Comic Con sometime. As soon as he can find

595
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:13,743
the list of everyone's favorite charities he
promises to pledge $50 to each of them. Thank

596
00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:14,926
you.

597
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,506
BRIAN: Where can they find that list, Matt?

598
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:21,312
MATT: If you do a search for the Critter's guide
to Critmas on the Geek and Sundry website or do a

599
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:24,062
Google search for Critter's guide to Critmas. You
can find all our charities on there to support for

600
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:27,597
this season. That is awesome! Thank you so much.

601
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:34,228
LIAM: I have a gift from Mark Dunlap. Here is a
little bit of art Mark did. He has made us a game.

602
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:48,673
This is the rulebook, as I gather, but look at
this game board. Look at that!

603
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:52,445
TRAVIS: Are you serious? That's really great!

604
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:56,108
LIAM: I'm going to, if no one objects, I'm going
to bring it home and look at it with my son.

605
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:57,389
ALL: Yeah!

606
00:38:57,389 --> 00:39:06,137
LIAM: It's super cool! It's getting wrinkled! I'm
going to roll it.

607
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:15,207
BRIAN: Hey guys, this is for Matt and Marisha.
This comes from Cullin. I can't read this whole

608
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:24,742
thing, but it's actually an engagement present.
How cool is that? Little context, there is a

609
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:32,065
family tradition in Cullin's family that goes back
to 850 C.E. in Germany where the engaged couple

610
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:35,852
would be given one of these by everyone in the
town.

611
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,889
MARISHA: I love how he hands it to me because he
knows.

612
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:42,923
MATT: Yep.

613
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,723
MARISHA: I like this tradition. Why?

614
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:49,479
MATT: This is a good tradition.

615
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:53,225
BRIAN: This is a really cool letter. I'll let you
guys read this.

616
00:39:56,475 --> 00:39:59,197
LIAM: This is how we settle arguments.

617
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,715
MATT: Yeah, exactly! That's why I handed it to
her.

618
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,666
MARISHA: This is what we call marriage
counseling.

619
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:10,522
MATT: You win. I'm sorry. I like how you're still
German for no reason.

620
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:22,076
MARISHA: No, he said from a German background.
That's amazing, thank you! Whoever-- oh, a Norse

621
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:24,531
colony in Germania.

622
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:27,488
MATT: But they originated in Germany, so you were
right.

623
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:30,952
TALIESIN: I like the notion that a bunch of Norse
got to Germany and said, "Yeah, we're done."

624
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:32,687
MARISHA: Yeah, this is how we settle things now.

625
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:34,449
TALIESIN: It's cold enough now. We're done.

626
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:52,445
MARISHA: This is for you, Matt. This is from Josh
Miller or @JMiller1 on Twitter. We read your

627
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:59,298
letter, Josh. It's amazing, and hopefully we do
run into you, maybe in the near future. He said

628
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:06,789
that this is for you, specifically.

629
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:09,084
TRAVIS: What is it?

630
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:19,704
MATT: I already see pentagrams, so I can hope it's
to finally summon my patron. Oh, your guys'

631
00:41:19,704 --> 00:41:22,256
favorite! Hourglasses!

632
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:23,638
SAM: Yes! I love them!

633
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:28,475
TRAVIS: That one is for shopping.

634
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:36,428
MATT: (laughs) That's so cool! Oh, it looks like
it's a dark brown sand, too. It's got dragon heads

635
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:41,899
pointing upwards. It's soul sand, from Minecraft.

636
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,672
TALIESIN: This is nuts.

637
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:46,125
LIAM: I'm so glad we all survived that dragon
fight.

638
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,952
TALIESIN: Yeah, that could have gone really
poorly.

639
00:41:48,952 --> 00:41:55,890
SAM: Well, except for Kima and Scanlan.

640
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,304
MATT: Thank you so much. I appreciate that.

641
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:03,007
TALIESIN: There's another one, man.

642
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:04,694
MATT: There's another one?

643
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:08,217
TALIESIN: I would say look at the letter first.

644
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:22,926
MARISHA: Oh shit! This is a donation from Sarah
Sutton to Mark Sutton. Wait, hang on.

645
00:42:22,926 --> 00:42:26,632
SAM: Mark Sutton Ministries. They help out Haitian
residents.

646
00:42:26,632 --> 00:42:36,782
MARISHA: She donated $30. For inspiration given in
honor of Critical Role. From Sarah at Fethermount.

647
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:40,814
Yay, Sarah! You're awesome, Sarah!

648
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:46,225
SAM: Nice letter from high schooler Nicholas
McGuire whose stumbled onto our show clicking a

649
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:52,464
link off of a HotPepperGaming episode. It takes
all kinds.

650
00:42:52,464 --> 00:42:57,421
TALIESIN: We apologize that it was not porn. It
was the only link on the internet that wasn't.

651
00:42:57,421 --> 00:43:01,677
SAM: This one says, "Dear Matt and crew, we hope
that you and Col. Scanlan's elite troops survived

652
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:08,077
these encounters--" we know that Scanlan does not.
"The subject critters are rumored to-- blooming

653
00:43:08,077 --> 00:43:16,170
onions!" What? "The subject critters are rumored
to be vulnerable to blooming onions--" I don't

654
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,430
understand the sentence structure. "Shiraz
and generally drive to and from work in the

655
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:32,423
pouches of chaotic evil kangaroos. Dr. Oz." What
is this? Ooh, it's a bunch of minis! Ooh, they're

656
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:38,696
all kinds of different cool stuff. Ooh, these are
all creepers!

657
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:40,325
LAURA: Ooh, that looks like Zahra.

658
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:44,233
LIAM: No, they go to Matt first.

659
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:48,444
LAURA: Oh no, it's like a ghoul Zahra. It's zombie
Zahra.

660
00:43:48,444 --> 00:43:55,299
MATT: I actually have a really amazing letter here
from Jade Rose from the UK, who is currently in

661
00:43:55,299 --> 00:44:02,520
New York City for the last few days of the
holiday. Really, this sweet letter I've read most

662
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,553
of it, I'm going to read the rest later on. Thank
you so much. It's really sweet. Thank you for it.

663
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:12,720
TRAVIS: Man, I got a thing from Shannon Pots all
the way from, can't pronounce it, Republic of

664
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,280
Korea. "Merry Christmas, my name is Shannon Pots,
I am from British Columbia, I am currently living

665
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,275
in South Korea as a teacher. I teach fourth-grade
international school. I teach my students to

666
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:25,802
embrace what makes them different and weird. I
share my love of D&D, Harry Potter, Doctor Who,

667
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:30,724
showing that they should be proud of who they
are." Loves 826LA teaching kids to be resourceful

668
00:44:30,724 --> 00:44:35,481
proud and accept themselves, their faults, and to
always be the best they can be. She's included a

669
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:42,156
baby green dragon that she made. It was needle
felted. "I hope that you all enjoyed it. Made with

670
00:44:42,156 --> 00:44:49,409
wool fibers and a fuzzy needle, Merry Christmas."
Thank you, Shannon @Shannon_Pots. You're the best.

671
00:44:49,409 --> 00:44:53,328
Thanks for all you do, teaching the kids!

672
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:59,049
LAURA: I want to put him on the tree, too!

673
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:05,336
BRIAN: Hey, guys. Monica Monmon--

674
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:09,872
LIAM: Also known as @madqueenmomo. She's one of
our prolific artists.

675
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:15,459
BRIAN: @madqueenmomo was what I was going to say
next. "Wanted to give you all a big thank you for

676
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:20,389
constantly inspiring artists everywhere weekly."
The artists are the inspiring ones, these guys

677
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:26,424
aren't. I'm just kidding. "Doing my final semester
of art school. Every week you inspire so many

678
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:30,896
critters I felt like it was time to give back. In
this box you will find a studio pouch dice bag

679
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:38,820
filled with sharpies, markers, and sketching
pencils for everyone. I've also included a tiny

680
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,316
sketchbook."

681
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:42,240
MATT: That's so cool.

682
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,939
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

683
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:47,036
LIAM: They're so cute!

684
00:45:51,476 --> 00:45:55,036
BRIAN: Wow.

685
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:00,674
MATT: Oh my god!

686
00:46:02,514 --> 00:46:04,574
MARISHA: Keyleth!

687
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:13,040
LAURA: What are the things inside?

688
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,507
LIAM: What's inside are sketchbooks. Monica, thank
you so much.

689
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:22,527
TRAVIS: Grog in a Cowboys jersey on the little
notebook inside.

690
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:26,458
(noises of delight)

691
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:32,584
BRIAN: They all have sketchbooks in them.

692
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,194
LIAM: Oh, wow!

693
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:41,565
TRAVIS: This is so amazing! I'm so happy right
now.

694
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,398
MARISHA: Look! She did short-haired Keyleth.

695
00:46:46,748 --> 00:46:48,980
LIAM: What a fun gift!

696
00:46:52,754 --> 00:46:56,264
TALIESIN: This is definitely going to be a con
bag.

697
00:46:56,264 --> 00:46:58,002
MARISHA: This is going to be my new journal.

698
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:01,233
TRAVIS: Look at all that anime.

699
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:03,300
TALIESIN: I really like anime version of us.
They're really cute.

700
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,776
LAURA: They're the cutest!

701
00:47:04,776 --> 00:47:10,860
MATT: I have a letter here Taliesin gave me
earlier. Whoa!

702
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,550
TALIESIN: Take a quick look at that.

703
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,487
MATT: TL; DR. "Dear Matt: Congratulations on your
engagement and another successful year on Critical

708
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:52,655
TALIESIN: Open the box.

709
00:47:52,655 --> 00:47:54,086
BRIAN: Open the box!

710
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,700
MATT: What?! Are you kidding me?

711
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,396
TRAVIS: Enjoy your box.

712
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:11,554
MATT: Look at that shit!

713
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:15,509
SAM: That's an Invicta watch.

714
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:17,705
MATT: That's amazing!

715

LAURA: Yeah, that's a nice watch.

716
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:23,365
MATT: Holy shit.

717
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:27,824
TRAVIS: Who gets to wear it first?

718
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:31,733
MATT: No! Me only. That is so amazing. That goes
on my arm right now.

719
00:48:31,733 --> 00:48:36,806
LIAM: It's a shame that those bracelets are
grafted into your flesh.

720
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:40,510
SAM: Pass it around, let's see it.

721
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,270
TALIESIN: Wow, that's very nice.

722
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:51,437
LIAM: I have a story written about the mother of
the twins from Paige. Paige, I'm going to read it

723
00:48:51,437 --> 00:48:54,787
after the show but I've got it. Thank you.

724
00:48:58,788 --> 00:49:07,383
LAURA: I've got a wonderful little note from
Alison Trace. She knitted a little superior

725
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:13,385
healing potion. She said it's for Percy, but she
said it could go to anybody who needs it.

726
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:14,376
TRAVIS: Cool.

727
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:16,731
BRIAN: That's not what she said.

728
00:49:20,421 --> 00:49:22,002
TALIESIN: What's inside?

729
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:24,455
LAURA: I don't know. I didn't open it.

730
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:25,831
LAURA: It's teeth.

731
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:28,390
TALIESIN: I hope it's teeth because it can then go
to my teeth collection.

732
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,186
TRAVIS: Taliesin, god.

733
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:31,728
TALIESIN: What, man?

734
00:49:32,738 --> 00:49:36,618
LAURA: You do have a teeth collection, don't you?

735
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:43,483
TALIESIN: I have it powdered. I put it in your drink
every week. Slowly I am getting inside of you.

736
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:44,545
LIAM: Gross!

737
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,720
TALIESIN: Make eye contact or go slow. No. You
ruined me.

738
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:55,720
BRIAN: Cut the feed, Denise.

739
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:02,213
TALIESIN: We've got a red d4. I've lost it in my
jam-jams.

740
00:50:02,213 --> 00:50:13,182
MARISHA: Jani Malkki, @realcamel on Twitter, sent
us chocolate from Finland.

741
00:50:13,182 --> 00:50:15,265
BRIAN: Finland chocolate?

742
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:24,997
SAM: Finland chocolate. That's the best
Scandinavian country for chocolate.

743
00:50:24,997 --> 00:50:30,570
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I got the joke. This is
awesome. I figured this out. This is brilliant.

744
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:41,155
It's a superior healing potion, so what's in a
superior healing potion? 8d4. Eight red d4s.

745
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:43,787
MATT: That?s pretty cute.

746
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:49,569
TALIESIN: That's clever. That's really clever. You
can actually have a superior healing potion ready

747
00:50:49,569 --> 00:50:51,125
to go in a bag.

748
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:53,855
TRAVIS: I don't get it.

749
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:57,196
TALIESIN: It's because you've never been healed in
your life.

750
00:50:57,196 --> 00:51:01,785
MARISHA: It's never been an issue. It must be
nice--

751
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:06,167
TRAVIS: (singing) It must be nice, it must be
nice--

752
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:09,432
SAM: (singing) --to have 700 hit points.

753
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:18,468
LIAM: This is from Rob Ramshaw: "Hello, Liam. My
16-year-old daughter Rhianna and I used to enjoy

754
00:51:18,468 --> 00:51:24,518
watching Critical Role together. Used to, you ask?
Therein lies the story. You see, last year Rhi was

755
00:51:24,518 --> 00:51:30,516
accepted by Rotary Club of America to represent
them as an exchange student in Taiwan. I wanted to

756
00:51:30,516 --> 00:51:34,081
share something special with her for the last
months she's still in the US. My 18-year-old son,

757
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:40,045
Logan, suggested we watch Critical Role together.
Good advice. So we started watching and

758
00:51:40,045 --> 00:51:43,684
immediately fell in love with the show. We even
made up characters of our own and pretended they

759
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:49,944
were hirelings who stayed in the background. Way
too soon, August 2016 came around, Rhi had to

760
00:51:49,944 --> 00:51:54,889
leave for Taiwan. While she was in the barnyard, a
couple of ravens decided to chase our tom turkey

761
00:51:54,889 --> 00:52:00,455
out of the feed pile. He took exception and a
scuffle went down. Rhi broke up the fight and

762
00:52:00,455 --> 00:52:05,103
scolded the ravens. When she looked down she saw
both the turkey and raven had lost some feathers.

763
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:12,843
She gave me the turkey feather for my hat and sent
you the raven feather because you play the raven

764
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:17,113
paladin. So here is your prize for keeping me and
my daughter entertained for the last year. A raven

765
00:52:17,113 --> 00:52:18,004
feather." Thank you.

766
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:25,283
MATT: I just read the letter from Jani Malkki over
in Finland. Thank you so much. This is really

767
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:26,124
sweet.

768
00:52:27,456 --> 00:52:33,451
MARISHA: It's another short story from @Tiamat_ZX
on Twitter, who I love. Thank you so much. I will

769
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:34,781
read it when I get home.

770
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:39,913
BRIAN: There's some stuff here for you guys.

771
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:44,626
(laughter)

772
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:52,721
BRIAN: It's weird that Max laughs at all that
stuff when he knows how professional I am. This is

773
00:52:52,994 --> 00:52:59,257
from a guy named Matt Miller-- Matthew Miller. He
made a donation to the Children's Theater of

774
00:52:59,257 --> 00:53:07,213
Charlotte. It's a really good letter. I've been
reading it for the past 43 minutes. He sent this,

775
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:09,819
which is a box--

776
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,106
SAM: Box Machina.

777
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:23,778
BRIAN: Real original, Sam. Look, more notes, and
there's dice in here. Just kidding, Matthew Miller

778
00:53:23,778 --> 00:53:29,764
didn't send this. Whichever person put this next
to me put them together. Thank you for sending

779
00:53:29,764 --> 00:53:41,499
your manuscript, question mark? And for your
donation, Matthew. This is from Ray or Roy.

780
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:48,507
I can't tell, but it's handwritten, and I just
learned how to read from Grog. Beautiful dice set

781
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:51,472
in a beautiful box.

782
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:03,205
LAURA: There's three chocolates left.

783
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:05,546
TRAVIS: Which ones?

784
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,793
SAM: This feels heavy. There might be a second
row.

785
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:14,523
BRIAN: There's eight of us. The chocolate
did not make it to Matt and I.

786
00:54:14,523 --> 00:54:19,880
MARISHA: This is little needlepointed Scanlan
shit.

787
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:25,787
BRIAN: We got free shit.

788
00:54:25,787 --> 00:54:27,453
SAM: Stay creative and awesome!

789
00:54:27,453 --> 00:54:31,724
TALIESIN: Blue poop, take a shot. Everybody 
at home, it's time to take a shot.

790
00:54:31,724 --> 00:54:41,419
SAM: Love Neeska @ladyneeska. Thank you for more
poop. This might be the best poop I've ever gotten.

791
00:54:41,419 --> 00:54:45,173
TALIESIN: That's a really solid poop.

792
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:47,663
BRIAN: How many do you get, Sam?

793
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:57,071
SAM: I've gotten a dozen or so, but this poop
might be the the best poop I've ever gotten.

794
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:01,194
BRIAN: Are you going to sleep with that poop
tonight, Sam?

795
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:06,494
TALIESIN and BRIAN: You should sleep with that 
poop on your chest.

796
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:09,488
SAM: I will. I'm going to Cleveland steamer myself
with this tonight.

797
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:19,190
MATT: Okay, so this dice set is actually Reya's
first dice set they ever had.

798
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,265
BRIAN: That's pretty awesome.

799
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:24,305
MATT: That's really sweet. Thank you so much. I
love this.

800
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:32,835
TRAVIS: Who's next?

801
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:34,770
MARISHA: For Ashley.

802
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,801
BRIAN: Great. It's going in the bag.

803
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:42,683
SAM: Guys, so far, good episode of Talks Machina
or best episode of Talks Machina?

804
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:46,692
LAURA: You're on it, Sam, so obviously--

805
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:48,820
TALIESIN: Too easy.

806
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:59,490
MARISHA: This is from Judith, a.k.a. @judrakJ at
Twitter from the Netherlands. Travis. Sam.

807
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,166
BRIAN: That's north of here.

808
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:07,749
MARISHA: She said, "Dear Matt, Taliesin, Marisha,
Laura, Travis, Ashley, Liam, Sam, and the crew.

809
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:12,617
Hi. Do you know the feeling of writing your secret
crush notes? Of course you do. Well, this is kind

810
00:56:12,617 --> 00:56:16,315
of the feeling I have writing this letter to you
guys, so please forgive me if this letter is

811
00:56:16,315 --> 00:56:19,087
incoherent, a little awkward, and/or maybe a
little coy."

812
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:20,770
TRAVIS: Yours is way longer than mine.

813
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:24,763
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not going to read the whole
thing, but I thought the beginning was cute.

814
00:56:24,763 --> 00:56:26,051
BRIAN: That's awesome.

815
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:28,252
SAM: Mine just says, "You're handsomer than
Travis."

816
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:30,099
TRAVIS: Really? Mine says, "I lied to Sam."

817
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:36,539
(laughter)

818
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:41,532
SAM: Merry Critmas.

819
00:56:43,472 --> 00:56:47,489
BRIAN: I am so happy. Oh, nice shot!

820
00:56:51,479 --> 00:56:54,764
MATT: Amanda, your Kima cosplay is amazing.

821
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:56,225
TALIESIN: Yeah.

822
00:56:56,225 --> 00:56:59,552
LAURA: There's so many undone letters. Look at all
these letters!

823
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:05,476
SAM: (singing) Letters. We've got letters.
(speaking) Is it a good sign that the crew all has

824
00:57:05,476 --> 00:57:09,202
nooses around their necks? Is that okay?

825
00:57:09,202 --> 00:57:10,854
TALIESIN: Appropriate for this time of year.

826
00:57:10,854 --> 00:57:17,417
MARISHA: Someone donated to the Nature
Conservancy, and I got a turtle. I don't know who

827
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:28,559
this is from. Oh, jeez. They got this bookmark for
you, Sam.

828
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:35,051
SAM: Oh! That's a turtle bookmark. I read a lot of
books to my kids. Not to me.

829
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:38,514
TRAVIS: If you read books to yourself, I would
watch that.

830
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:43,915
SAM: I just read Rat Queens, finally.

831
00:57:43,915 --> 00:57:48,509
TALIESIN: Oh, hey, that's good! It's so good!
There's more coming now.

832
00:57:49,709 --> 00:57:55,065
MATT: Thank you, @dutchcritter. Your
Gilmore-themed leather bag based off of your

833
00:57:55,065 --> 00:58:00,140
paladin's LARP tabard is awesome! And I like your
little note at the back here. I think it's very

834
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:04,181
true, so thank you so much. That's really sweet.

835
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:09,749
MARISHA: I don't know who this is. They just
signed it "L". So whoever anonymously donated,

836
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:12,364
you're awesome and thank you, L.

837
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,344
TALIESIN: Brought to you by the letter L.

838
00:58:14,344 --> 00:58:18,507
LIAM, LAURA, MARISHA, and MATT: Thanks, L!

839
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:23,812
BRIAN: Oh, there's another engagement present!
"Matt and Marisha, hi! You might remember us from

840
00:58:23,812 --> 00:58:26,823
Critmas last year. We sent you the Tolkien-style
wood-burned map."

841
00:58:26,823 --> 00:58:28,859
MATT: Yes! Which I still have in my office.

842
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:35,368
BRIAN: "We wanted to send something else to say
'Congratulations on your engagement.' We know you

843
00:58:35,368 --> 00:58:41,627
guys love Avatar. So this is--" and then she tells
me what it is, but I want you to open it.

844
00:58:41,627 --> 00:58:43,039
MATT: Here, Marisha, you open it.

845
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:44,073
MARISHA: Okay!

846
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:48,989
BRIAN: It's from Steve and Megan Katronio.

847
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:51,018
MATT: Steve and Megan! Thank you!

848
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:53,813
SAM: Ooh.

849
00:58:54,493 --> 00:59:00,804
MARISHA. Oh, Jesus. Oh no. It's an Iroh quote.
"You have come to the crossroads of your destiny.

850
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:04,260
It is time for you to choose. It is time for you
to choose good."

851
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,206
MATT: Iroh. Uncle Iroh.

852
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:10,230
MARISHA: Uncle Iroh! It's an Avatar map!

853
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,421
BRIAN: Yeah, she says, "This is the map from The
Last Airbender. The show, not the movie,

854
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:20,520
obviously." That's awesome.

855
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,077
MATT: That's so cool!

856
00:59:22,077 --> 00:59:26,910
MARISHA: And it's an Iroh quote. Iroh's the best.

857
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,172
TRAVIS: Who wants to unwrap minis?

858
00:59:32,172 --> 00:59:33,828
TALIESIN: I'll unwrap minis.

859
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:37,333
TRAVIS: This is from Michael W. Crabtree says,
"Hi, Critical Role cast. I want to thank you for

860
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:42,478
the amazing journey. I used these a lot during my
teens dabbed with Pathfinder, blah blah blah," Oh,

861
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:47,363
man. "Vex's death felt real. Being a twin myself,
I recognised the distance willing to go to protect

862
00:59:47,363 --> 00:59:52,721
my sister. I'd like to thank Matt for making DM
Tips and DMs Guild classes. Since watching, I pick

863
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:56,415
up DM's books and now I'm currently running three
six-to-eight-person 5e campaigns!"

864
00:59:56,415 --> 00:59:58,252
SAM: Three campaigns?

865
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:01,304
TRAVIS: Three. He says, "The blood hunter lycan
order have been a joy to play."

866
01:00:01,304 --> 01:00:02,395
MATT: Nice!

867
01:00:02,395 --> 01:00:03,970
TALIESIN: What?

868
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:09,603
TRAVIS: Wow, that's a lot of terms that I don't
even understand. "Critical Role has inspired me to

869
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:12,180
channel my originality and thank you for letting
me play with my seven-year-old daughter. It's okay

870
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:17,056
to make believe, embrace who you are, enjoy the
experience. Bring family together. I look forward

871
01:00:17,056 --> 01:00:20,738
to showing my daughter that dad is just as silly
as she is. Michael W. Crabtree A.K.A-- How do you

872
01:00:20,738 --> 01:00:21,957
pronounce that?

873
01:00:22,108 --> 01:00:24,145
SAM: Zanyondelcet!

874
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:27,010
TRAVIS: And he included these incredible--

875
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,801
MATT: These minis are amazing!

876
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:31,516
SAM: Retail box action?

877
01:00:31,516 --> 01:00:34,731
BRIAN: Wow! That's no joke.

878
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,039
MATT: Liam, look at that.

879
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:43,774
TRAVIS: He said, "I have also included a more
paladin-ish rogue Vax for you, if you'd like to

880
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,169
use it in a home game."

881
01:00:45,169 --> 01:00:46,741
MATT: Show it to the camera!

882
01:00:46,741 --> 01:00:50,420
TRAVIS: "Liam, your embracing of the Raven Queen
was by far my favorite part in your game."

883
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:57,530
LIAM: Wow! Look at how firm his buttocks are!
Wow!

884
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,371
MATT: Finally! True accurate to the game!

885
01:00:59,371 --> 01:01:01,724
SAM: Good focus pulling, by the way.

886
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:08,284
LAURA: Cool! I like to think that he's got Whisper
and the dragon sword.

887
01:01:08,284 --> 01:01:11,531
LIAM: Who should box these?

888
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:14,897
MATT: These should go back in the box so they
don't get damaged.

889
01:01:14,897 --> 01:01:18,165
TRAVIS: I'll take them. I'll put them on the
shelf.

890
01:01:20,455 --> 01:01:24,917
MATT: I have a present here from Rob? It just says
"From Rob." Thank you, Rob!

891
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:26,615
TRAVIS: Hey, my name's Rob!

892
01:01:26,615 --> 01:01:28,230
BRIAN: Could've been from Glenn.

893
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,039
MARISHA: Awesome presents in the mail!

894
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:36,378
MATT: I think this may have been from one of the
letters we read earlier. It is a dungeon furniture

895
01:01:36,378 --> 01:01:37,365
pack.

896
01:01:37,365 --> 01:01:38,902
ALL: Whoa!

897
01:01:38,902 --> 01:01:41,205
MATT: It's a bunch of cool mini furniture bits and
pieces.

898
01:01:41,205 --> 01:01:46,517
BRIAN: That is from Rob Green. "Merry Christmas,
Merry Critmas, Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and

899
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:49,862
Happy Holidays. I hope this holiday finds you well
and with your loved ones. Thank you for all the

900
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:53,513
fun and merriment you do to bring us every week.
Matt, here are some things for the dungeon to add

901
01:01:53,513 --> 01:01:59,040
to the atmosphere and make the players go, 'What's
that?' 'You don't know. Do you want to examine

902
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,995
it?' Have fun."

903
01:02:00,995 --> 01:02:02,951
MATT: Oh, that's so cool!

904
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:06,014
MARISHA: He's bringing a new life to VHS cases.

905
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:16,639
LAURA: I've got a lot of stuff from Valerie
Thompson. She wrote, number one, a manuscript that

906
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:22,012
she said Taliesin should read first, because you
love to read. She made a bunch of bear paw

907
01:02:22,012 --> 01:02:31,566
stickers for me! And then she made a dragonscale
pendant for each person because she's a dragonborn

908
01:02:31,566 --> 01:02:39,360
in her campaign. She's got a red one for Grog and
a black one for Vax and a gold one for me and a

909
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:46,656
brass one for Scanlan and a green for Keyleth, and
the blue is for Percy-- yeah, it's a pendant! You

910
01:02:46,656 --> 01:02:52,423
got a platinum one, Matthew. And Ashley got a
white one.

911
01:02:52,423 --> 01:02:54,097
MATT: That's so cool!

912
01:02:54,097 --> 01:02:55,607
LAURA: They're pretty!

913
01:02:55,607 --> 01:02:57,709
SAM: You're very olfactory today.

914
01:02:57,709 --> 01:02:59,442
TRAVIS: I feel like you could eat this.

915
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,681
LAURA: They're clay pendants. She made them!

916
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:03,219
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure it's like taffy.

917
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:05,968
BRIAN: No, don't eat it!

918
01:03:05,968 --> 01:03:08,874
LAURA: We can make them into chokers!

919
01:03:08,874 --> 01:03:12,812
TRAVIS: (gobbling sounds) I'm a turkey!

920
01:03:12,812 --> 01:03:21,406
SAM: Really? She spent all this time on this, and
you're going to make it into a turkey wattle?

921
01:03:21,406 --> 01:03:23,411
TALIESIN: That's a very funny turkey wattle.

922
01:03:24,411 --> 01:03:28,255
MATT: "Dear Matt and Marisha, congratulations on
your engagement. I'm so happy for you two. Wish

923
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:33,198
you both all the love and happiness in the world.
May all your dice rolls be natural 20s." Maybe

924
01:03:33,198 --> 01:03:38,359
hers. Mine, too. "My husband and I geeked out at
our wedding. Our rings had a set of dice on them,

925
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:44,478
engraved with a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 in a
simple titanium band," which is pretty rad. "We

926
01:03:44,478 --> 01:03:46,839
love doing geeky things together, so we had a
geeky day and we loved it. Enjoy your very own

927
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:52,441
special day." From Aniske, or @LadyNiske on
Twitter. Thank you so much! That's so sweet!

928
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:57,813
MATT: It's got a little pin with hearts on it!

929
01:04:02,513 --> 01:04:07,163
SAM: Brian Wiggly Foster? Is that a vacuum-sealed
pack?

930
01:04:07,163 --> 01:04:12,569
BRIAN: This is enough food to survive on Mars for
two years.

931
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:14,905
SAM: Mark Watney!

932
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:25,752
BRIAN: Guys, there's a note here that says: "Here
is a labor of love. Laura used to do quilts, and

933
01:04:25,752 --> 01:04:35,056
probably could've done better, but it was made
with all the best interest and it was the first

934
01:04:35,056 --> 01:04:44,942
time piecing shapes. The squares were printed by
Matt Abernathy, and the design is by Kenneth

935
01:04:44,942 --> 01:04:46,100
Wriggles."

936
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,689
SAM: This is a huge deal!

937
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:56,308
BRIAN: I can't read the last sentence until Denise
brings me a scissors or a knife so I can open

938
01:04:56,308 --> 01:05:07,643
this-- oh, wait! Sorry, Denise! Sorry, Denise. I
have to put Ashley down. All right girls, and

939
01:05:07,643 --> 01:05:09,330
Liam. Here it comes.

940
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,550
LAURA: Is this empty?

941
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,557
BRIAN: Spread it out!

942
01:05:16,557 --> 01:05:18,980
TALIESIN: Whoa!

943
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:24,463
BRIAN: "The star represents the star of the
Cowboys. Sorry for not putting the line and the

944
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:27,766
paws for Trinket. We love you all."

945
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:30,708
TALIESIN: I like how the Cowboys get
representation, but Trinket does not.

946
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,765
BRIAN: Look at this list of people, you guys.

947
01:05:33,765 --> 01:05:35,761
MARISHA: It's a you and Grog quilt!

948
01:05:35,761 --> 01:05:38,267
MATT: Guys, look at this list of people that
contributed to this.

949
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,264
TALIESIN: Oh my-- holy cow!

950
01:05:40,264 --> 01:05:42,060
SAM: This is a real deal!

951
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,127
MARISHA: These are the same people who did the one
for us, too?

952
01:05:44,127 --> 01:05:52,116
BRIAN: This is the amount of people that worked on
this quilt.

953
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:57,707
LAURA: Who is it for? Who gets to have it? Because
it looks like a whole lot of me and Grog.

954
01:05:58,707 --> 01:06:00,702
TALIESIN: It's you and Grog.

955
01:06:00,702 --> 01:06:03,559
LIAM: I'm there because I'm her brother.

956
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:06,166
LAURA: Baby, it's ours! Our quilt!

957
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:09,747
BRIAN: It's you and Travis's, because it's got the
Cowboys and the thing for Trinket.

958
01:06:09,747 --> 01:06:19,488
SAM: I know where this is going! This is going in
the guest bedroom so that your guests can sleep on

959
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:24,053
your pictures of you every time they visit.

960
01:06:25,223 --> 01:06:30,862
TRAVIS: Oh, Craven Edge! Guys, we can still go get
Craven Edge, I'm just saying.

961
01:06:32,862 --> 01:06:35,504
MARISHA: I know where he is.

962
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:39,518
BRIAN: Put that in the guest room so I can sleep
on it when I pass out drunk at your guys' house.

963
01:06:39,518 --> 01:06:41,686
LAURA: This is going to be my TV-watching comfy
throw.

964
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:46,280
TALIESIN: You want to wake up and just 
have Grog's face right there.

965
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,849
MATT: I often do.

966
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:50,254
LAURA: This is so amazing!

967
01:06:50,254 --> 01:06:54,200
SAM: It must've taken hours! Days!

968
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,190
LAURA: This would've taken so long.

969
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,458
TALIESIN: That's a lot of work.

970
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:59,502
TRAVIS: Really, really awesome.

971
01:06:59,502 --> 01:07:01,571
TALIESIN: I live with a quilter. That's a lot of
work.

972
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:06,975
LAURA: I mean, look at these! These are the
teeniest little stitches I've ever seen!

973
01:07:06,975 --> 01:07:10,732
SAM: He doesn't want to admit it, but Travis is
actually crying right now.

974
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:17,598
BRIAN: Real human boy tears, too. Not those old,
wooden ones.

975
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:22,832
TRAVIS: No, I ain't crying. Wow! Look at the list
of names!

976
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:24,350
SAM: Read all of them.

977
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:27,378
TRAVIS: Ready? I'll read them all in one second.
(screams)

978
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:35,509
SAM: Critical Role Scanlan got a letter from the
World Wildlife Fund, asking for donations.

979
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,474
(laughter)

980
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:40,517
SAM: This was technically part of Critmas.

981
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:44,517
BRIAN: What we asked people to do, we said ask for a
donation in Scanlan's name.

982
01:07:44,912 --> 01:07:56,480
SAM: They suggest I donate $55, $69, or $85, and
in the spirit of Critmas, I'll consider that. They

983
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,725
really want this!

984
01:07:59,725 --> 01:08:01,557
LAURA: Oh my god, did you get stamps?

985
01:08:01,557 --> 01:08:05,163
SAM: They're not usable stamps. They're just
stickers.

986
01:08:05,163 --> 01:08:07,689
TALIESIN: Hey! They knew.

987
01:08:07,689 --> 01:08:10,546
BRIAN: So you have to give a donation <i>and</i> pay
for the postage.

988
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:16,872
SAM: Nope! "No postage necessary if mailed in the
United States."

989
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:18,941
TALIESIN: You have to leave the United States.

990
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:21,862
MATT: That is fantastic.

991
01:08:21,862 --> 01:08:23,899
SAM: Thank you, guys, for thinking of me.

992
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,227
(laughter)

993
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:31,177
BRIAN: Someone misunderstood "make a donation in
Scanlan's name" for "<i>request</i> a donation in

994
01:08:31,177 --> 01:08:32,334
Scanlan's name".

995
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:33,686
TALIESIN: That's weirdly genius.

996
01:08:34,246 --> 01:08:39,961
BRIAN: I love it. Send more requests for Sam to
give other people money.

997
01:08:39,961 --> 01:08:42,031
SAM: I will donate, and I'll tweet about it.

998
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:44,848
LIAM: Jasmine Riegel in Germany, I read your
long--

999
01:08:44,848 --> 01:08:45,723
SAM: Riegel?

1000
01:08:45,723 --> 01:08:46,644
LIAM: Riegel.

1001
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:47,734
SAM: R-I-E-G-E-L?

1002
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:48,848
LIAM: R-I-E-G-E-L.

1003
01:08:49,478 --> 01:08:53,842
SAM: That's me! This is my kincharkunen person! I
don't know.

1004
01:08:55,452 --> 01:08:58,551
LIAM: It's a beautiful handwritten letter, which I
won't read on air, but we're going to pass it

1005
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:02,013
around to everybody because we have so many
letters, but thank you, I read the whole thing

1006
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:03,526
during the stream.

1007
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:08,720
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm doing a Final Fantasy IV
dungeon crawl right now.

1008
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,535
SAM: Are we still on french horns?

1009
01:09:10,535 --> 01:09:11,725
MATT: Yeah, we are.

1010
01:09:11,725 --> 01:09:13,437
LAURA: It never ends.

1011
01:09:13,437 --> 01:09:15,762
TRAVIS: There's a box of something if somebody
wants to unbox--

1012
01:09:15,762 --> 01:09:18,780
MATT: I've got a letter here, it says, "Hi Matt, I
just wanted to write to you and say thank you for

1013
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,172
doing such a great job dungeon mastering Critical
Role. I wanted to send you something, but I felt

1014
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:26,199
the best thing I could do-- " I know, trust me,
"is send you these three dice. As you can see,

1015
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:30,194
they've seen better days, but I started playing
Dungeons & Dragons back in 1980, with basic D&D,

1016
01:09:30,194 --> 01:09:33,622
so they've seen a lot of use, and the other three
are missing somewhere in some dark dungeon.

1017
01:09:33,622 --> 01:09:37,909
They're older than you, and I hope you'll get some
joy from this oldtimer's first dice. Thank you for

1018
01:09:37,909 --> 01:09:43,341
making my hobby so loved, from David Carter," who
has-- oh! Legit original, when you had to fill the

1019
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:48,402
numbers by scratching in the crayon dice! Let me
tell you, these have seen some rolling because

1020
01:09:48,402 --> 01:09:52,280
when these first came out of the box, they were
jagged as shit. They were pointed and could take

1021
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:59,706
out your flesh. That is awesome! This is old
school d10, d12, and d6-- oh, dude. The d4s were

1022
01:09:59,706 --> 01:10:05,526
caltrops. Straight up, you could throw them behind
you and evade. Yeah, it was amazing. That's so

1023
01:10:05,526 --> 01:10:10,012
cool! David, thank you so much! These are actually
going to go onto my personal onscreen use set.

1024
01:10:10,012 --> 01:10:17,172
Thank you. (laughs) Who's up next?

1025
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:27,072
TALIESIN: We got sent-- Marisha, Ashley, and Matt
got sent some art from Steven-- Lexime, I believe?

1026
01:10:27,072 --> 01:10:37,488
I'm not entirely sure; I mispronounce my own name.
For Marisha, there are some princesses,

1027
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:41,709
apparently. Marisha has some princesses.

1028
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:42,863
MARISHA: Oh, cool!

1029
01:10:44,493 --> 01:10:48,050
MATT: That's awesome! That is some awesome
crossover.

1030
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:51,208
TALIESIN: For Matt, we've got a cowboy.

1031
01:10:53,478 --> 01:10:55,113
BRIAN: Oh, nice!

1032
01:10:55,113 --> 01:10:57,484
TALIESIN: And something else--

1033
01:10:57,484 --> 01:10:59,239
BRIAN: (high-pitched voice) It's high noon!

1034
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:06,072
TALIESIN: And then, sadly, this is for Ashley, but
I guess she's not around right now.

1035
01:11:06,072 --> 01:11:13,260
BRIAN: Ooh, she's going to love this. We have a
lot of cool Spider-Gwen stuff at the house.

1036
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,045
TRAVIS: Thank you, Steven.

1037
01:11:15,045 --> 01:11:21,919
MARISHA: This is the princesses as Avatar mashup.
As benders, which I'm so about. I remember this

1038
01:11:21,919 --> 01:11:25,652
series. I remember seeing it on Tumblr when it
came out.

1039
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:29,292
MATT: Yeah, they have a continuation of it here as
well, which is awesome.

1040
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:33,759
MARISHA: This is pretty fucking awesome. Thank you
so much!

1041
01:11:33,759 --> 01:11:35,045
LAURA: This is a really cool thing.

1042
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:38,325
TALIESIN: I have a bag if you want to keep your
thing away from all the other terrible things--

1043
01:11:38,325 --> 01:11:40,928
LAURA: "Laura, my husband and 12-year-old
daughter are crazy about Critical Role. They're now

1044
01:11:40,928 --> 01:11:44,058
playing D&D every Sunday with a small group here
in Reno, Nevada. We thought of you when my

1045
01:11:44,058 --> 01:11:47,703
ten-year-old was selling items for a fundraiser at
school, and we hope you enjoy 'Trinket's Peanut

1046
01:11:47,801 --> 01:11:50,693
Butter Bears!'"

1047
01:11:50,693 --> 01:11:53,693
BRIAN: Whoa, give them to me!

1048
01:11:53,693 --> 01:12:02,989
LAURA: What? How? And also, they made a donation
to My Friend's Place, which is my charity that I love.

1049
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:04,686
BRIAN: That's great!

1050
01:12:04,686 --> 01:12:07,967
TALIESIN: I'm sorry. I've had some wine.

1051
01:12:10,437 --> 01:12:17,447
LAURA: Thank you Andrew and Grace and Ashley and
Michelle! Thank you, all of you. Sorry. What are

1052
01:12:17,447 --> 01:12:19,670
you doing? What did you do? What are you doing?

1053
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:26,212
SAM: Nothing, a close up of the booze that Travis
was trying to open. The camera keeps finding it!

1054
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:32,834
(laughter)

1055
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:35,033
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to enjoy these season's
greetings!

1056
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,692
BRIAN: We can't show the label.

1057
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:44,639
LAURA: Oh, that's true, we can't. Unless they want
to be a sponsor.

1058
01:12:44,639 --> 01:12:52,449
SAM: They could be a sponsor. If Shlitzmalt Liquor
wants to sponsor us-- (singing) Shlitzmalt Liquor

1059
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:53,461
bull!

1060
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:57,457
MATT: Right now, it looks like Travis had to find
the bathroom and had an empty bottle.

1061
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:01,116
TALIESIN: Brought to you by Shlitz: "Why did you
have to do that?"

1062
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:08,544
LIAM: Guys, I have some hand-done art from Jen
Zurin Smith. I remember your art; I've seen it

1063
01:13:08,544 --> 01:13:25,261
online. Here you go-- Taliesin. Marcia, here you
go. This one's for me. Here you go. Hold that for

1064
01:13:25,261 --> 01:13:27,926
Ashley. This is for Mr. Mercer.

1065
01:13:27,926 --> 01:13:29,355
BRIAN: Oh, this is so beautiful!

1066
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:32,922
LIAM: Yeah, I remember seeing this.

1067
01:13:32,922 --> 01:13:34,998
TRAVIS: Jen-- is it Zurin Smith?

1068
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,667
LIAM: Maybe. Zurin?

1069
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:39,900
LAURA: These are awesome! I like the colors!

1070
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,214
BRIAN: Did we get them all in the shot?

1071
01:13:44,214 --> 01:13:45,535
MATT: Almost. Missing Liam's.

1072
01:13:45,535 --> 01:13:47,501
LIAM: Jeez, I didn't know we were doing a whole
thing.

1073
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:49,258
TRAVIS: Put it in the frame!

1074
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,098
LAURA: Put it in the fucking frame!

1075
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:54,091
BRIAN: Now you're blocking-- there you go.

1076
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:56,318
SAM: Fight, fight, fight!

1077
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,381
BRIAN: I don't want to fight. I love you guys! I
love everyone!

1078
01:14:03,461 --> 01:14:05,677
MATT: That is awesome. Thank you so much!

1079
01:14:05,677 --> 01:14:06,911
BRIAN: Thank you so much!

1080
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:08,030
LAURA: Thank you!

1081
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:09,249
SAM: These are great!

1082
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:13,500
LAURA: Give me these Peanut Butter Bears!

1083
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,692
MARISHA: What's next?

1084
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:20,317
LIAM: That's the first box, so it resets, right?
Open it!

1085
01:14:20,317 --> 01:14:24,726
LAURA: I'm going to be in a mocap suit, so
tomorrow with all this chocolate.

1086
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:26,533
BRIAN: On a Wednesday?

1087
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:30,588
MARISHA: Because that velcro neon was so
flattering to begin with.

1088
01:14:30,588 --> 01:14:31,552
LAURA: I know.

1089
01:14:31,552 --> 01:14:34,957
LIAM: Does anyone else want a bear?

1090
01:14:34,957 --> 01:14:38,897
MATT: I have to try a peanut butter bear. It needs
to happen.

1091
01:14:38,897 --> 01:14:40,116
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

1092
01:14:41,116 --> 01:14:43,385
MARISHA: I'll have a bear.

1093
01:14:43,385 --> 01:14:49,024
BRIAN: Trinket is delicious! He makes a great rug
and a great chocolate bar.

1094
01:14:49,024 --> 01:14:51,043
LIAM: Taliesin, you want a bear?

1095
01:14:51,043 --> 01:14:52,529
TALIESIN: I definitely want a bear!

1096
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:54,326
LIAM: Sam, would you like a bear?

1097
01:14:54,326 --> 01:14:55,646
SAM: I'll have a bear.

1098
01:14:55,646 --> 01:15:05,004
BRIAN: (singing) Sam's like a bear-- he just said
Sam's like a bear. (singing) I don't know where my

1099
01:15:05,004 --> 01:15:05,930
home is.

1100
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,526
MATT: What I thought when I came in tonight-- what
we were missing for Critmas, it was more Nelly

1101
01:15:13,526 --> 01:15:14,646
Furtado.

1102
01:15:14,646 --> 01:15:19,020
BRIAN: It was Nelly Furtado? I got that note.

1103
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,285
MATT: I noticed.

1104
01:15:20,285 --> 01:15:21,883
BRIAN: It is hard to talk.

1105
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:31,781
SAM: My mom, Momlan, sent these for us for all of
you guys. They're graphic novels. Momlan sent

1106
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:34,697
graphic novels for all of us.

1107
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:37,525
MARISHA: Are those the graphic novels we spilled
wine on at the top of the show?

1108
01:15:37,525 --> 01:15:38,802
SAM: Yes, they are.

1109
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:40,393
TALIESIN: We added a splash of color.

1110
01:15:40,393 --> 01:15:49,454
SAM: Signed by the author, I believe. Jerome
Charron, my mom's husband. I was going to say baby

1111
01:15:49,454 --> 01:15:52,127
daddy, but that would-- nope.

1112
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:55,559
MATT: That's awesome!

1113
01:15:55,559 --> 01:15:57,199
SAM: Yeah. They're from Momlan.

1114
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,794
MARISHA: I call dibs on one with no wine on it.

1115
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:01,305
TALIESIN: I will take wine.

1116
01:16:02,495 --> 01:16:04,356
MATT: There's a lot of porn in there.

1117
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:12,556
SAM: They're really good. My mom's husband is a
prolific author, and that is male genitalia right

1118
01:16:12,556 --> 01:16:16,817
there. Brian, I'm sorry.

1119
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:19,832
BRIAN: For what? I have male genitalia.

1120
01:16:19,832 --> 01:16:21,295
SAM: Well...

1121
01:16:21,295 --> 01:16:30,123
BRIAN: Or I used to, before I went to that soft,
smooth surface, which is way easier now. It's

1122
01:16:30,123 --> 01:16:37,647
great when TSA pulls me aside. I go, "Grab it all!
There's nothing."

1123
01:16:37,647 --> 01:16:42,729
SAM: It's called <i>Billy Budd KGB</i>, if anyone wants
to pick it up. Jerome Charron.

1124
01:16:43,519 --> 01:16:53,402
LAURA: So this is from Justin Sharp, who sent a
tweet to us a while ago. I don't know if you guys

1125
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:58,659
remember, but his daughter had just been diagnosed
with cancer. She's going through chemo right now,

1126
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:05,445
but he wanted to thank us for giving him an
uplifting thing to watch every week. He sent us

1127
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:12,478
all ribbons so we can support Chloe as she's going
through chemo. "As she's going through treatments,

1128
01:17:12,478 --> 01:17:17,095
I'm asking people to send her cards to keep her
spirits up. I'm sure she'd appreciate it if you

1129
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:23,008
guys could spread the word." So we'll put her
little PO box number here so Critters can send her

1130
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:23,875
some cards.

1131
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:26,838
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm assuming it's a PO box, right?

1132
01:17:26,838 --> 01:17:40,249
LAURA: Yeah. It's a PO box. No worries, guys. PO
Box 392, Woodside, Delaware, 19980. So write some

1133
01:17:40,249 --> 01:17:47,155
stuff to Chloe! Keep her spirits up! Team Chloe!
The sparkly princess saving her own damn self.

1134
01:17:47,155 --> 01:17:53,726
That's what it says. So that's awesome. Love you,
Justin. Love you, Chloe.

1135
01:17:53,726 --> 01:17:55,719
MARISHA: Get it, Chloe.

1136
01:17:57,509 --> 01:18:00,803
MATT: All righty. Having torn through Critmas--

1137
01:18:00,803 --> 01:18:02,154
SAM: Is that it?

1138
01:18:02,154 --> 01:18:03,608
TALIESIN: I think we did it.

1139
01:18:03,608 --> 01:18:06,535
LAURA: Was that all of it? Wait, there's this
thing over here. What was that from?

1140
01:18:06,535 --> 01:18:07,969
TRAVIS: It's for a GoPro.

1141
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:13,925
SAM: It's a piece of a GoPro.

1142
01:18:13,925 --> 01:18:16,051
LAURA: Why is there a piece of a GoPro--?

1143
01:18:16,051 --> 01:18:20,318
TRAVIS: It's my Secret Santa gift. Merry
Christmas!

1144
01:18:20,318 --> 01:18:24,062
MATT: Every year, you'll get another piece until
eventually you can assemble it into your own

1145
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:25,024
GoPro.

1146
01:18:25,024 --> 01:18:27,203
TRAVIS: Don't give her false hope. That's not
true.

1147
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:30,469
MARISHA: If we collect them all, maybe they'll
sponsor us.

1148
01:18:30,469 --> 01:18:32,134
TALIESIN: There's no GoPro coming.

1149
01:18:32,134 --> 01:18:35,552
LAURA: Oh, and Matt, you have a letter over here.

1150
01:18:35,552 --> 01:18:36,752
MATT: Oh, no way!

1151
01:18:36,752 --> 01:18:39,967
BRIAN: That's a subpoena. I've seen one of those.

1152
01:18:39,967 --> 01:18:42,425
MARISHA: Oh, is it yellow?

1153
01:18:42,425 --> 01:18:44,750
LAURA: Oh, and there's another letter here!

1154
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,972
MATT: This is from Matthew Ravensbergen.

1155
01:18:48,512 --> 01:18:51,048
BRIAN: I'm so freaking jealous of that last name.

1156
01:18:51,048 --> 01:18:53,677
TALIESIN: He's like the alternate evil version of
you.

1157
01:18:53,677 --> 01:18:57,043
MATT: I will not read this on stream because it
says "do not read on stream," but thank you very

1158
01:18:57,043 --> 01:19:00,847
much for the letter, and I will read this off
stream, Matthew. Good strong name.

1159
01:19:03,517 --> 01:19:08,192
TALIESIN: There should be a yellow sheet of paper
somewhere around here. We got a letter from the

1160
01:19:08,192 --> 01:19:12,048
Post Office asking that we renew our post office
box for another year.

1161
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:13,586
MATT: Thank you Post Office! You've been
gracious--

1162
01:19:13,586 --> 01:19:19,150
TALIESIN: Thank you for being okay when all of
this fills your store.

1163
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:21,880
LAURA: Did you already read this? This is from an
Elle.

1164
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,855
TALIESIN: Oh, Elle?

1165
01:19:25,855 --> 01:19:28,830
LAURA: Did you read this one already? We didn't
open this.

1166
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,635
TALIESIN: Yeah, we did. From Elle?

1167
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:32,506
MARISHA: Well, no, there was an Elle that gave a
donation.

1168
01:19:32,506 --> 01:19:40,488
LAURA: Okay. This is from @cxnnamonspxder, but
there's Xs in the places of the Is. Anywho, she

1169
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:46,359
made us drawings, you guys! And she donated to the
Nature Conservatory.

1170
01:19:47,519 --> 01:19:49,806
SAM: Does that mean I don't have to?

1171
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:53,188
TALIESIN: No, Sam.

1172
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:55,606
TRAVIS: Oh, look at Keyleth. That's adorable.

1173
01:19:58,516 --> 01:20:04,527
LAURA: Oh, I love that we're all in little
Christmas gear! This is so cute! There's

1174
01:20:04,527 --> 01:20:05,642
Ashley's.

1175
01:20:05,642 --> 01:20:08,450
MARISHA: I have Christmas tree earrings!

1176
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:11,175
LAURA: Look at this! I'm wearing a Trinket
sweater.

1177
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,941
TRAVIS: Grog's in a Santa hat. Someone will be
punished for this.

1178
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:18,687
MATT: (laughing) "Someone will be punished for
this."

1179
01:20:18,687 --> 01:20:21,480
SAM: Quick! Make them all kiss!

1180
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,098
BRIAN: I can't reach that far.

1181
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:29,065
LAURA: I accidentally did that to my brother.

1182
01:20:29,065 --> 01:20:32,073
LIAM: Not the first time!

1183
01:20:35,483 --> 01:20:38,650
MARISHA: Awesome. That was nice. Now Christmas is
over.

1184
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,714
SAM: Brian prepared a game. It's called "Spin the
Bottle."

1185
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:47,387
MATT: No. No!

1186
01:20:47,387 --> 01:20:53,479
SAM: It's going to be awkward for some of us, but
not for me and Liam.

1187
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:57,594
(laughter)

1188
01:20:57,594 --> 01:21:02,443
BRIAN: There's plenty of photographic and video
evidence that-- yeah, that it's happened many

1189
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:03,530
times.

1190
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,943
TALIESIN: And this is where it devolves into
"Truth or Dare."

1191
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:08,263
MATT: If I could say something real fast?

1192
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:10,704
BRIAN: I'll allow it.

1193
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:12,484
(laughter)

1194
01:21:12,484 --> 01:21:14,641
TALIESIN: Wow, that took a dark turn!

1195
01:21:14,641 --> 01:21:15,930
MATT: Yeah, well doesn't it always?

1196
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,669
SAM: Is this where Matt quits the show?

1197
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,750
BRIAN: Don't do it on this show.

1198
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,237
MATT: No, I got what I came in here for, guys. I'm
out.

1199
01:21:23,237 --> 01:21:28,427
MARISHA: The lead singer spinning off. Solo
album!

1200
01:21:28,427 --> 01:21:31,048
TALIESIN: I'm going to run a game for stuffed
animals.

1201
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:41,148
MATT: I'd be okay with it. Well, no, a universal
year-wrap-up here. We're going towards the end of

1202
01:21:41,148 --> 01:21:48,801
our second year doing this craziness on stream and
our four years playing this game-- plus now. And

1203
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:57,738
it's-- (sighs) I don't know, it's invigorating,
it's delightful, and this is a perfect example of

1204
01:21:57,738 --> 01:22:03,517
the amazing generosity that this community
continuously perpetuates and helps support each

1205
01:22:03,517 --> 01:22:10,379
other with. And us. We have the pleasure of being
able to do this every week and have people care

1206
01:22:10,379 --> 01:22:16,763
that aren't just us, and that's really cool. We
constantly get letters and emails from a lot of

1207
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:24,253
people in this community saying how much this
means to them, and I want to reiterate on that

1208
01:22:24,253 --> 01:22:29,873
part. We're so glad, because it means so much to
us, and it means so much that other people care

1209
01:22:29,873 --> 01:22:37,212
about it as much as we do-- and I'm partially
rambling now, but I'm really humbled and touched

1210
01:22:38,212 --> 01:22:46,156
and proud. Proud of everything that you guys have
done. We're such a small part of this now. This is

1211
01:22:46,156 --> 01:22:51,519
so much bigger than anything we ever did or now do
on this show, and that's what you guys continue to

1212
01:22:51,519 --> 01:22:59,051
carry and make your own adventures, your own
heroes, your own community support structures, and

1213
01:22:59,051 --> 01:23:03,906
continue to make the world a better place through
inspiration and storytelling and being good

1214
01:23:03,906 --> 01:23:11,799
people. I think I speak for all of us when I say
that we're extremely grateful and thankful and

1215
01:23:11,799 --> 01:23:17,305
humbled by all of what you guys continue to put
out there. And thank you. Thank you from the

1216
01:23:17,305 --> 01:23:18,762
bottom of my heart and our hearts.

1217
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:21,668
TRAVIS: Roll a charisma check.

1218
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:30,347
BRIAN: That's awesome. Well, speaking of, after a
month or more of asking for people to send in

1219
01:23:30,347 --> 01:23:33,493
their "What does Critical Role mean to you?"
videos, it's ready.

1220
01:23:33,493 --> 01:23:35,951
MATT: Are we going to cry? Forever?

1221
01:23:36,741 --> 01:23:40,792
BRIAN: Everybody tear off a piece of the bearskin
rug and prepare to use it as a Kleenex.

1222
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:43,579
TRAVIS: Is it set to Sarah McLachlan's "I Will
Remember You?"

1223
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:48,874
MATT: I was hoping it was going to be set to
AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" but--

1224
01:23:52,498 --> 01:23:54,567
BRIAN: Let's take a look.

1225
01:23:55,567 --> 01:23:59,947
CRITTER: Hey. I know this story isn't anything
new, but I want to send it in anyways.

1226
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:02,836
(music starts)

1227
01:24:02,836 --> 01:24:05,894
CRITTER: Welcome to another episode of "Why We
Love Critical Role."

1228
01:24:05,894 --> 01:24:09,401
CRITTER: So this is a quick video about what
Critical Role means to me.

1229
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:11,995
CRITTER: One minute is really short, but I'll
try.

1230
01:24:11,995 --> 01:24:15,900
CRITTER: Oh man, under a minute? That's not going
to happen. Okay.

1231
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,445
CRITTER: I'm sorry, I'm going to try to keep this
short, but I keep running over a minute, and I'm

1232
01:24:20,445 --> 01:24:24,677
on my tenth take, and I can't do this much longer
because I'm nervous.

1233
01:24:24,677 --> 01:24:27,768
CRITTER: I originally wasn't planning on filming
something, but then I had a really shitty day

1234
01:24:27,768 --> 01:24:29,983
today and thought I should talk about something
that makes me happy.

1235
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:36,109
CRITTER: It's three in the morning. And I'm up in
Europe to watch Vox Machina kill something. That's

1236
01:24:36,109 --> 01:24:37,914
how much Critical Role means to me.

1237
01:24:37,914 --> 01:24:44,253
CRITTER: Critical Role means to me is that even
when we have sleepless nights, I still have

1238
01:24:44,253 --> 01:24:46,534
something to watch and keep me company.

1239
01:24:46,534 --> 01:24:53,519
CRITTER: I actually get up every Friday at
3:50am-- because I live in Germany-- before work

1240
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:55,497
to watch the show live.

1241
01:24:55,497 --> 01:24:58,366
CRITTER: It's been a huge inspiration to me for
storytelling purposes.

1242
01:24:58,366 --> 01:25:02,588
CRITTER: It is one of the most imaginative forms
of storytelling I've ever seen.

1243
01:25:02,588 --> 01:25:07,584
CRITTER: What I see on screen is the exact same
game I play with my friends, except I get to

1244
01:25:07,584 --> 01:25:11,006
experience this one game with tens of thousands of
other people.

1245
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:15,353
CRITTER: I obviously really like the characters. I
find them very relatable and really

1246
01:25:15,353 --> 01:25:16,253
inspirational.

1247
01:25:16,253 --> 01:25:22,374
CRITTER: It means joy and excitement, but it also
means crying for these characters that I've come

1248
01:25:22,374 --> 01:25:23,904
to love so much.

1249
01:25:23,904 --> 01:25:30,082
CRITTER: I really love being able to turn on-- I
was about to say the telly. The Twitch, and see

1250
01:25:30,082 --> 01:25:34,825
three badass women doing badass stuff every week.

1251
01:25:34,825 --> 01:25:38,130
CRITTER: What Critical Role means to me is a sense
of friendship.

1252
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:42,554
CRITTER: When I found Critical Role, I was
instantly attracted to the friendship that existed

1253
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:43,980
between the cast members.

1254
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:49,069
CRITTER: As a retired soldier, it's easy to forget
that there's still great people like you guys out

1255
01:25:49,069 --> 01:25:51,491
there, so seriously, from the bottom of my heart,
thank you.

1256
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:55,408
CRITTER: The story of Vox Machina means that there
will always be friends that you can find and

1257
01:25:55,408 --> 01:26:00,339
families that you can forge, who will keep on
fighting their hardest with you, even when it

1258
01:26:00,339 --> 01:26:01,715
feels like you've already lost the war.

1259
01:26:01,715 --> 01:26:07,900
CRITTER: Okay, so Critical Role and what does it
mean to me? It's been a tough year, dudes, and--

1260
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:11,739
it's been a tough year.

1261
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:15,391
CRITTER: Critical Role got me through a lot of the
rough days.

1262
01:26:15,391 --> 01:26:21,461
CRITTER: I discovered Critical Role at a difficult
time in my life. My brother had just passed away

1263
01:26:21,461 --> 01:26:25,621
and life was crappy. It helped me to get through
that really sucky time.

1264
01:26:25,621 --> 01:26:30,470
CRITTER: Last year I had serious depression,
anxiety, and so on. Essentially, I was having

1265
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:33,342
trouble getting to grips with what I was and who I
wanted to be.

1266
01:26:35,472 --> 01:26:43,394
CRITTER: It gave me something to cling to in a
really dark time and made me beg my friends to

1267
01:26:43,394 --> 01:26:47,197
play D&D and then send them sad D&D photos when we
didn't.

1268
01:26:47,197 --> 01:26:52,087
CRITTER: A little less than a year ago, I was in a
very different place. I was depressed, and I

1269
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:58,610
didn't really see a point in living. And Critical
Role changed that.

1270
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:03,860
CRITTER: Because it has gotten me through a
particularly hard year, which started with my mom

1271
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:08,075
getting very sick and then passing away within six
weeks of her cancer diagnosis.

1272
01:27:08,075 --> 01:27:12,310
CRITTER: Critical Role has gotten me through the
death of my grandfather, it has gotten me through

1273
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:18,497
the threat of homelessness, and it continues to
get me through the constant stress of a close

1274
01:27:18,497 --> 01:27:20,624
family member and their battle with cancer.

1275
01:27:20,624 --> 01:27:24,831
CRITTER: To say you guys saved my life, I'm being
literal. Before Critical Role, I was in a pretty

1276
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:30,181
bad place. My depression was at its all-time high,
I had lost my core group of friends, and it had

1277
01:27:30,181 --> 01:27:37,868
gotten so bad that I decided to end it. I knew
everything that I was going to do. I even had a

1278
01:27:37,868 --> 01:27:45,077
date set and planned. And that date came and went.
For all intents and purposes, I was watching

1279
01:27:45,077 --> 01:27:54,349
something so compelling that I forgot my plan. It
didn't occur to me anymore.

1280
01:27:54,349 --> 01:28:03,001
[music]

1281
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:06,685
CRITTER: I've said it before, but Critical Role
was a light in the darkness for me.

1282
01:28:06,685 --> 01:28:09,697
CRITTER: Critical Role really gave me hope.

1283
01:28:09,697 --> 01:28:14,401
CRITTER: It's helped me get over the feeling that
I can't keep doing the things I like to do,

1284
01:28:14,401 --> 01:28:22,083
because of my age. And that everything's okay,
that I can keep doing it. You're only as old as

1285
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,525
you think you are.

1286
01:28:23,525 --> 01:28:28,140
CRITTER: I stumbled into this community and found
a family.

1287
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:33,405
CRITTER: Because of Critical Role, I started DMing
my very first campaign about a year ago, and it's

1288
01:28:33,405 --> 01:28:37,583
been amazing since then. I've met a bunch of
wonderful, fantastic people.

1289
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:40,811
CRITTER: The whole community around Critical Role
got me into stuff that I never would have liked in

1290
01:28:40,811 --> 01:28:46,164
the first place. The playlists got me into
Chvrches and First Aid Kit. Patrick Rothfuss's

1291
01:28:46,164 --> 01:28:49,636
guest appearance got me into the Kingkiller
Chronicles, which I love.

1292
01:28:49,636 --> 01:28:55,109
CRITTER: I've joined some amazing D&D games. I
have started drawing and creating again, after

1293
01:28:55,109 --> 01:29:00,528
pretty much giving up on it. I have grown so much
as an artist and a person due to the support of

1294
01:29:00,528 --> 01:29:03,510
all of you Critters out there.

1295
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:08,539
CRITTER: About a year ago, the cast decided that
they liked some of my work, and asked me to do

1296
01:29:08,539 --> 01:29:15,475
some t-shirts for them. Now, until that point, I
was just a hobbyist, not really a graphic

1297
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:19,585
designer. But I'm going to be. And that's thanks
to Critical Role.

1298
01:29:19,585 --> 01:29:24,034
CRITTER: I have seen that there's so much more for
me to explore as a performer, and it has rekindled

1299
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:28,743
my passion that had recently been waning. For
this, I could not be more grateful.

1300
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:33,331
CRITTER: There once was a girl from New Jersey who
loved many things that were nerdy. She cosplayed

1301
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:39,050
and crafted, but dice weren't added, 'til seeing
that show late on Thursday. From watcher to player

1302
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:45,816
to DM, the obsession became quite extreme. Her
dice bags did swell, and her shop's doing well,

1303
01:29:45,816 --> 01:29:48,371
and it's all thanks to this nerdy stream.

1304
01:29:48,371 --> 01:29:55,963
CRITTER: The fanart inspired me to try to start
making art. I stink at it. Not good at it at all.

1305
01:29:55,963 --> 01:29:58,120
Nope, not good at all. But I'm trying.

1306
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:02,743
CRITTER: When I first started watching these nerdy
ass voice actors, I was a college dropout with no

1307
01:30:02,743 --> 01:30:09,902
job. Now I'm a teacher whose OTP has officially
gone canon. Twice! I'm not saying causation, but

1308
01:30:09,902 --> 01:30:11,475
I'm definitely saying correlation.

1309
01:30:11,475 --> 01:30:15,854
CRITTER: I work for a social service industry, and
we primarily serve people with mental health

1310
01:30:15,854 --> 01:30:21,524
issues and that are suffering from poverty. I've
been granted the ability to start a Dungeons &

1311
01:30:21,524 --> 01:30:26,512
Dragons group through my job, which I absolutely
love, and I know my clients do, too.

1312
01:30:26,512 --> 01:30:31,863
CRITTER: You guys are amazing, and thank you so
much for sharing your beautiful, wonderful world

1313
01:30:31,863 --> 01:30:34,009
with us. It means a lot.

1314
01:30:34,009 --> 01:30:36,376
CRITTER: Thank you so much. Thank you.

1315
01:30:36,376 --> 01:30:42,196
CRITTER: I just wanted to say thank you for giving
me something to look forward to every week, and

1316
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:45,018
also I may or may not have a Slayer's Take
tattoo.

1317
01:30:46,508 --> 01:30:47,969
CRITTER: Is it Thursday yet?

1318
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:52,485
MARISHA: Shit, man.

1319
01:30:54,455 --> 01:30:56,547
BRIAN: Told you guys.

1320
01:30:56,547 --> 01:30:57,686
LAURA: Fuck.

1321
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:59,730
TRAVIS: They hate us.

1322
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:03,107
(laughter)

1323
01:31:04,757 --> 01:31:08,267
TRAVIS: That's really touching. That's
incredible.

1324
01:31:08,267 --> 01:31:13,025
BRIAN: I want to thank everybody who sent in
videos. I know for some of you it was really,

1325
01:31:13,025 --> 01:31:19,965
really hard to put yourself on video and send it
to us, and we thank you, and thank you for putting

1326
01:31:19,965 --> 01:31:26,627
yourself out there. Obviously, you can tell it's
hit home, and I'm sure all the rest of the

1327
01:31:26,627 --> 01:31:31,725
Critters out there are so glad and encouraged that
you guys did that. Thank you so much. That's all

1328
01:31:31,725 --> 01:31:36,356
the time we have for this week, we are going to
post that video on YouTube and the Geek & Sundry

1329
01:31:36,356 --> 01:31:39,612
website, bunch of other places, so--

1330
01:31:39,612 --> 01:31:41,539
SAM: Brian, by the way.

1331
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:42,717
BRIAN: Yes?

1332
01:31:42,717 --> 01:31:48,867
SAM: Thank you for helping put that together. That
video is the only good part of your show.

1333
01:31:48,867 --> 01:31:54,206
(laughter)

1334
01:31:54,206 --> 01:32:01,222
BRIAN: We'll get him, sweetheart. We'll get him.
Okay, thank you guys for coming. Thank you for

1335
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:02,817
doing Critmas on our show.

1336
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:05,316
MATT: Thank you for having us.

1337
01:32:05,316 --> 01:32:10,771
BRIAN: Hopefully we get a ratings bump out of
this. There's no Critical Role on Thursday night,

1338
01:32:10,771 --> 01:32:19,435
the 22nd, which is two days from this night now.
Hang out with your friends instead, and we will

1339
01:32:19,435 --> 01:32:29,420
see you guys back on Talks Machina on January 3rd
for our post-Thordak battle episode. Yes. Have a

1340
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:36,680
great Critmas everybody. We love you, don't forget
to love each other, and don't worry-- fuck! It's

1341
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,588
almost January 3rd?

1342
01:32:38,588 --> 01:32:39,768
(laughter)

1343
01:32:39,768 --> 01:32:41,707
TALIESIN: It's almost 2017.

1344
01:32:41,774 --> 01:32:46,484
BRIAN: It's almost 2017. Good night 
everybody!

1345
01:32:46,484 --> 01:32:47,858
(applause)

1346
01:32:47,858 --> 01:32:51,421
MATT: We love you, guys! Happy holidays!

1347
01:32:51,421 --> 01:33:06,497
(Intro music)

1348
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:08,741
