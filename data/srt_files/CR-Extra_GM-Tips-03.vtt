NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
MATT: Hey guys! My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a
voice actor and dungeon master for Geek &amp; Sundry's

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.751
Critical Role, and welcome to my video series
about tips and tricks for burgeoning and/or

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:15.015
classic GMs and DMs. Today's topic is going to be
preparing for the unexpected, which is a large

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.434
part of the actual GMing experience.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.574
[trumpet fanfare]

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:25.854 line:1
Preparation is the key to not being prepared. I
know that sounds crazy, but you can definitely be

00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:29.234 line:1
comfortable pulling stuff out of your ass.
You'll be doing that a lot. The best that you

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:34.415 line:1
can think of alternative scenarios, or give loose
notes as to other possibilities that your players

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:38.583
might dive into, does help you be a little more
prepared for the crazy. Especially if you've had

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:42.725
some time with the party and with those players,
you kind of get a feel for their game style and

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:46.825
the type of questions they ask, the type of off
the cuff actions they take and the type of

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:51.366
directions they tend to veer towards. Once you
get a feel for that you can start preparing a

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.406
little bit some alternate paths from the main
story that you've been developing.

00:00:54.406 --> 00:01:00.236
Even so, the players will always, always
surprise you. You'll be caught off guard, they'll

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:03.835
do things that make you go (bewildered) "okay!"
and you've got to roll with it. You

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:07.236
don't want to deny the players their actions,
unless they're completely ridiculous, and over the

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:10.335
top, and don't fit within the world or the
setting. For the most part you want to let them go

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:14.891
along with their choices, as cockamaimy and weird
as they may be. Because those will make for some

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:20.210
of the best stories, for one, and will take you in
some of the best places as a GM that are hilarious and fun.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.925
I get most of my fun when I'm thrown off the mark
as a dungeon master. I like the mental gymnastics

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:29.355
that are part of it, and the kind of back and
forth with the players, creating this unknown

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:34.086
future path. It's a really exhilarating experience
for me and it's scary at first, trust me, I

00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:38.585 line:1
understand, but it's really exhilarating. On
that note too, you don't want to try and railroad

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:43.462 line:1
the players too much. I know you've built this
wonderful story that you're working so hard to get

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:47.415
them through, and you will be able to keep them on
that story path for the most part. Unless they're

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:52.244
completely insane. If they veer a little bit
left and right let them steer out of the way. Let

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:59.145
them find some weird side elements and you can
always guide them back in slowly. Don't try

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:02.944
and force them on that particular path or get
frustrated if they begin to veer from your set

00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:08.767
plan. Because that's kind of what really makes
RPGs its own special genre of gaming aside from

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:13.841
other formats is you <i>can</i> do that it all is fluid
and it's wonderful.

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:19.727 line:1
Don't be afraid to roll with some of the stranger
player choices, because it can be

00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:23.890
interesting. Make sure you can help justify
in the moment how it would work in that world. If

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.935
the player comes to a locked door and they're
like, "I want to unlock it" that makes sense. If

00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:32.396
instead they're like "I want to see if I can get
this vial of acid to slowly dissolve parts of the

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:37.076
wood, then set up a barricade that can push and
focus all the energy--" and you're like "Sure, go

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:42.255
for it. Give it a shot." Let them build their
strange idea and give that-- especially if it's

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:48.927
very unwieldy, that very mildly slight
chance it could function. And if it succeeds,

00:02:48.927 --> 00:02:54.739
fantastic, and explain the awesome, fantastic
success that it was. If it fails, which is more

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.686
often than not, explain the awesome, fantastic,
epic failure that it was. These are the

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.905
stories that you'll continue to tell for a very
long time.

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:10.955 line:1
Just to reiterate on your preparation for the
session, parallel avenues are a really good focus,

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:16.217 line:1
and try and have those side pocket aspects at your
disposal just in case they veer off to the sides.

00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:23.665 line:1
Ways to help with that, I find, keeping a list of
fantasy names nearby. That you can find online,

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:27.374 line:1
you can find-- or sci-fi names if you're using a
sci-fi genre game, or if you're using a modern

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:32.866
game. Just having a list of names that would fit
in your world or your setting near your session

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:38.536
setup allows you to pull quickly if you have to
spontaneously create someone that doesn't exist.

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:46.903
"Oh, you're going to the hospital? Okay.. uh..
You run into a nurse. The nurse is named David.

00:03:46.903 --> 00:03:50.844
Can I help you? I'm David." It makes it feel and
gives the illusion that you know exactly what

00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:53.485
you're doing. And that's part of the fun. It's the
whole kind of Wizard of Oz element.

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:54.825
"Don't look behind the curtain!"

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:58.025
You want to stay in control and having those
resources near you really helps with that.

00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:05.150 line:1
Having a list of player names is really good. You
can also create a small cache of unused random

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.765
NPCs that you can flesh out a little. You can
create bartenders, you can create policemen, you

00:04:09.765 --> 00:04:15.175
can create space bounty hunters. You can create
all sorts of characters that aren't really part of

00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:18.455
the story, and they're just kind of in your box,
waiting to be pulled out in case something like

00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:22.716
that happens. That's a really cool thing to
have at your disposal. You'll be very thankful

00:04:22.716 --> 00:04:24.645
you kind of did that preparation for yourself.

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:28.665 line:1
Also, you can make a list of small, minor story
hooks. There's a lot of great resources online

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:32.894 line:1
that you can search, or look in your resource
books for your various RPGs to find good story

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:37.296
hook elements. There's lists and tables you can
roll up. Those are really cool if you have to

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:41.728
create an NPC to try and decide what their story
is. Dave, the nurse. You talk to him for a bit and

00:04:41.728 --> 00:04:47.037
you find out that he's missing his left arm, and
you ask him why, and he says, "Because it was

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:51.795
taken by demons!" That would be a terrible story,
but it's a story that came out of nowhere, and now

00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:54.015
the players are like, "We've gotta find Dave's
arm!"

00:04:54.015 --> 00:05:00.055
It's cool to have that resource at your disposal
because it makes you more comfortable with the

00:05:00.055 --> 00:05:02.466
environment, more comfortable with the
improvisation, and makes the storytelling more

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:07.933 line:1
fluid. Also a cool little cache of rewards is also
good to have in case they do some weird stuff on

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:12.047 line:1
the side and succeed in an unplanned way. You can
have a couple of magical items, or cool laser

00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:16.635
weapons, or some sort of bit of information about
the story that is sitting in this amorphous pile

00:05:16.635 --> 00:05:20.626
for use in case the opportunity arises
for you to gift it to the players.

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:22.754
It's cool to have those in your pocket as well.

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:28.805
So overall, the key of improvisation for your
games is comfort. That can come from taking

00:05:28.805 --> 00:05:31.395
improv classes, if you have the opportunity. Those
are very helpful, even if you don't plan to go

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:36.245
into performance art. The improvisational skill is
useful in all facets of life, I've found, and this

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:41.592
is very much so. As you get more
comfortable with it all these little notes, all

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:46.735
these little things you can do to prepare for the
unexpected are tremendously helpful in building

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:53.389
your fast storytelling skills and to maintain a
consistent narrative. Regardless of what the

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.045
players throw at you, which is kind of fun.

00:05:55.045 --> 00:05:58.225
Thank you for watching, we'll have other episodes
of this you can watch of this up on

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:03.378
