00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,045
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:07,543
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons.
I think this is our 24th episode, which is

3
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:13,926
ridiculous. We've been doing this since March, and
it gets more and more ridiculous every week. Glad

4
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:17,826
you guys can join us. The new guys, welcome to our
chaos. For all the old folks, glad you could come

5
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:23,381
and join us again. Quick thing I want to mention:
last week we were talking about the changes to

6
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:30,279
Critmas, because we had stresses on scheduling and
we had crew here, and when things go long, we were

7
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:36,588
talking about possibly moving to Periscope on a
different day, separate medium. Well, the fanbase has

8
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:43,729
spoken very loudly and very intently about their
reaction to that, and so what we're doing, to still

9
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:48,395
make it so people aren't kept here for ridiculous
hours weekly, we're still going to have

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,760
Critmas on the stream, but it's going to be once a
month. It's probably going to be the first

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,249
Thursday of every month, and we're going to make
it an extensive day for that month where we open

12
00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:01,932
everything that evening. We still get to
experience and share that with you guys, but also

13
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:06,277
not keep these guys here way too late unpaid every
Thursday night. So I think that's the plan we're

14
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:10,731
going with forward. Hopefully, that's cool with
everyone, because we love it, too, and we want to

15
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:14,087
make sure we still share that with you guys.

16
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:18,739
All right, couple of other announcements. First
and foremost, I wanted to mention again-- we

17
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,176
mentioned it last week, as well-- there's that Hasbro
game design contest, design the next party game.

18
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:30,562
That's still up until end of this month, I
believe. So if you want to check it out, you can

19
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:35,110
go ahead and tweet at me, last week's episode or search
for the Hasbro game design contest. That's still

20
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:42,972
happening. Also, there's a film series that I'm a
part of called Mythica. It's like a high fantasy

21
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:49,356
film series where I play the main villain, the
necromancer Zorloc. It's fun times. It's like

22
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:55,955
awesome, fun, fantasy genre film. And they're
currently putting up a Kickstarter to finish the

23
00:01:55,955 --> 00:02:00,656
post on the third film, so you should check that
out. Search Mythica on Kickstarter and you should

24
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:07,370
find it there. Also, WeLoveFine is still running
their DND t-shirt contest for their Rage of Demons

25
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,645
release for Wizards of the Coast, where you can
submit your own t-shirt designs that fit within

26
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:17,066
the Rage of Demons theme. I am one of the judges
on that, so if you submit your art to this, there

27
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:23,784
is a cash prize. All the rules are up there on the
WeLoveFine contest site. And I'll be able to judge

28
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:27,909
your artwork and hopefully put you through to the
end. So there's that. Trying to get through these

29
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:34,389
as fast as possible. Our TeeSpring shirt for Is It
Thursday Yet? is still up. It has one more

30
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,956
week. So if any of you guys want to get the
limited edition Critical Role Is It Thursday Yet?

31
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:46,144
shirt, that is only available for one more week
and then it'll be gone forever, so get it while

32
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:56,470
you can. Let's see. I'm doing my best to get
through this as fast as possible. No worries. Not

33
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:09,214
everything. Also, Ashley's show Blindspot is
premiering this coming Monday.

34
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:12,332
(cheering)

35
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:16,564
MATT: Which is so exciting. You can check out
Ashley on Blindspot where she'll maybe be sneaking

36
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:22,533
Critical Role stuff into the show, hopefully.
We're trying to push her to do that. So you should go

37
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:27,941
support her. See it. It's awesome. And all of us
lament that's the reason she's away from us.

38
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:33,575
Someone want to handle our other cool--

39
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:39,669
LAURA: But it's not on us yet. Oh look, now you
can see us.

40
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:48,898
LIAM: Why don't I go, and then you can go. Hey,
you guys. I just want to make sure all of you are

41
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:53,906
aware-- this is going to be so awkward-- I want to
make sure you're all aware of a Kickstarter that's

42
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:59,078
out there that is put up by a good friend of mine
named Joe Madureira. Now if you don't know who Joe

43
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:06,773
is, he is a comic book rock god and a game
developer. When I was a teenager, he made a comic

44
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:12,836
book called Battle Chasers. Look, here's mine. From
when I was 16, Joe. I fell in love with it. Nobody

45
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:18,932
does art like Joe Mad does, and I've followed his
art for years and years. Even when I fell out of

46
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:24,372
comic books, I was checking in with Hellboy and I
was checking in with Joe Mad. And then, years

47
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:29,093
later, I got cast in a game called Darksiders as
one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I played

48
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:34,157
War, and I walked into the room and Joe Mad was in
the fucking room, and then we became friends. So

49
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:39,655
that game was amazing. Darksiders is a beautiful
game. It just reeked of Joe's art style and now he

50
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:46,807
has formed another company called Airship Syndicate
and they have a Kickstarter up. They are making a

51
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:54,025
game called Battle Chasers. Oh shoot! I didn't put
the thing that comes-- oh, Nightwar! Battle

52
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:59,803
Chasers: Nightwar. They've already hit their goal,
but there are stretch goals. They are making an

53
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:06,657
RPG, sort of in the ilk of JRPGs, like Final
Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. And it's just going to

54
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:16,096
be bathed in the glory of Joe Mad's amazing art
style. So they've hit their goal, but the bigger

55
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:20,810
the budget, the better the game is going to be. I
backed it already. And you guys should at least go

56
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,566
check it out. A lot of love for Joe Mad.

57
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:29,659
ORION: Yeah, me too. I'm on the same end. I knew
Joe Mad through meeting Liam for a while, and

58
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:38,695
later realizing that this guy I knew as an amazing
voice director and an amazing producer has inked

59
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:46,708
some of my favorite issues of Excalibur, and I
crapped my pants. I have four of yours, Joe, in my

60
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:52,439
box right now at home. He's an amazing guy and
awesome thing to back. Check it out, please.

61
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,251
LIAM: And one, the main character from Battle
Chasers kind of looks like Pike!

62
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:58,376
LAURA: She does! I thought that, too.

63
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:01,105
MATT: That's sweet. Wunderbar!

64
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:11,765
TALIESIN: I got something. Next weekend, September
26 and 27, I'm going to be at a con!

65
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,933
In Anchorage, Alaska.

66
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,522
ORION: That means "convention".

67
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:24,271
TALIESIN: That means moose. I'm so excited. Senshi
Con in Anchorage. I'll be there. I know we at

68
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:35,475
least have, like, three fans at the very least in
Alaska. Come on by. I'd

69
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,756
love to see you. It'll be awesome.

70
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,901
MATT: Fantastic. Speaking of conventions, guys.

71
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:43,514
MARISHA: Oh man, drop it like it's hot.

72
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:49,030
MATT: For those of you upper East Coast folks,
we've recently been able to announce that we will

73
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:57,776
be at and running some events at New York Comic
Con in October. All of us, the entire Critical

74
00:06:57,776 --> 00:07:02,573
Role team will be at Comic Con. We're going to
have signing, panel and all kinds of fun stuff

75
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:06,538
throughout the weekend. And we'll be there. And if
you're in the area, or if it's drivable, or even

76
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:09,232
if it's not, you should come anyway, cause we'd
like to see you.

77
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,024
If it's trainable, if it's flyable.

78
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:14,795
TRAVIS: If you steal a horse, steal a horse and
ride it.

79
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,843
LAURA: If you want to ride a bear there, I
wouldn't judge you.

80
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:20,768
MARISHA: And what weekend is New York Comic Con?

81
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:24,740
LIAM: Eight, nine, ten, 11.

82
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,627
MARISHA: October 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th. So
you've got three weeks to prepare.

83
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:33,759
MATT: Yeah, so excited to be there. Excited to see
you there. And it'll be a lot of fun.

84
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,773
A lot of fun.

85
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:38,285
LIAM: Primarily doing stuff Saturday that we know.
We're waiting to see what's

86
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,887
going on Sunday weekend.

87
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,261
LAURA: Saturday is for sure.

88
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,452
TALIESIN: With more of us than are even here.

89
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:46,323
TRAVIS: Bring your swag. Bring your friends.

90
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:52,315
MARISHA: Not even all of us were at San Diego.
Well, we were all there, just not all at one point

91
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:53,756
at one time.

92
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,436
TRAVIS: Because we were missing Sam.

93
00:07:55,436 --> 00:08:01,282
MATT: The first full Critical Role con appearance.
Boom.

94
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,103
TRAVIS: The unicorn appears.

95
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:05,742
ORION: I'm going to get a hot dog.

96
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:15,625
MATT: Orion's going to get a hot dog. Awesome. Any
other announcements?

97
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,773
Or did you have something, you said?

98
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:20,457
LAURA: No, I was just so excited about New York
Comic Con,

99
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,768
I wanted to be a part of that announcement.

100
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,562
ORION: I would like to announce that I feel pretty
good.

101
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:29,740
TALIESIN: I'm terrified, personally, but--

102
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,779
ORION: I know, but maybe that's why I feel so
good.

103
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,516
TALIESIN: You were right. It is awful.

104
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,368
ORION: I'll get shunned for it happening, then I'm
like, oh, cool.

105
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:39,901
I don't have to worry about me right now.

106
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,447
MARISHA: So much pressure.

107
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,875
LAURA: Should we say that we have Kit here?

108
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:48,974
TALIESIN: No, we shouldn't tell them that we have
Kit here. Let's hold that back.

109
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:50,823
MATT: Kit Buss is not here.

110
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:55,064
MARISHA: We also have both of our artists
here.

111
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,690
LAURA: Kit and Wendy.

112
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,805
MATT: Kit and Wendy.

113
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:04,272
MARISHA: Kit and Wendy. Come here! But come here!

114
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:07,257
RYAN: There's a 30-second lag.

115
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:11,774
MATT: We'll eventually have them say hello to
everyone, but Kit Buss, our official CritRole

116
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:17,027
artist who did all the original character designs, 
continues to produce amazing art for this show, is here

117
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:20,962
visiting Los Angeles for the next week. So she's
here on the set and we'll drag her out in front of

118
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:23,336
the camera and embarrass her shortly.

119
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:26,216
TALIESIN: I've been curious precisely how long the
lag is, because--

120
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:28,114
LAURA: It's about 30 seconds.

121
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,174
MARISHA: We learned when we killed the carpet.

122
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:33,886
LAURA: Yeah. (muffled yelling)

123
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:36,651
MARISHA: Just time that. Time that.

124
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:40,585
MATT: I guess also an announcement for all you
League players out there: awesome character just

125
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:46,816
got announced called Kindred. Kind of a two-part
thing. That wolf that's the part of Kindred

126
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:50,792
sounds pretty cool so you should play it.

127
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,838
TRAVIS: I heard that. It's subtle.

128
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:56,988
MATT: Real subtle. It's a good one. I think that's
it, isn't it? I think we're good on announcements,

129
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,721
and we can start.

130
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,385
TALIESIN: I feel like we have, do we have an
address? Address?

131
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,960
MATT: Oh, the PO Box?

132
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,350
TALIESIN: Do we have that?

133
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,854
TRAVIS: It's up. Yeah, he's got it.

134
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:08,420
TALIESIN: It's up and in the chat?

135
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,140
RYAN: The mods are posting it in the chat.

136
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,791
MATT: The mods got that covered. Now diverting all
Critmas images and the boxes, and we have arrived.

137
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,421
Our nefarious Scanlan--

138
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:21,289
SAM: Whoa. Were you just talking about me?

139
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,347
MATT: Yeah!

140
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:25,715
SAM: Whoa, that's crazy. I was just talking about
me, too.

141
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:28,817
MATT: As was the website, because your interview
went up today.

142
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:36,650
SAM: Oh, that's right. I saw. Some of that I had my
ghostwriter write for me. I have a biographer and

143
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,966
a ghostwriter.

144
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,269
TRAVIS: Is that a ghostwriter on retainer that we
can also use?

145
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:42,883
SAM: Yeah, sure.

146
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:46,565
MATT: Good to know. Well, fantastic. Do you have
any announcements you want to make,

147
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:48,107
Sam, or shall we jump in?

148
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:51,852
SAM: No. Just that I don't have any dice but I can
use Orion's and they're going to be awesome.

149
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:56,692
LAURA: I have so many dice. Take this giant bag
and just fish some out.

150
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,017
SAM: Great. Thanks.

151
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,758
TALIESIN: The Bag of Disagreeable Dice.

152
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,915
LAURA: No, let him find them.

153
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:12,127
MATT: All righty, then in just a minute, let us
begin this next episode of Critical Role.

154
00:11:12,127 --> 00:12:20,463
[dramatic music]

155
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:24,351
MATT: Welcome back. All right, so to give you guys
a little heads-up of what has recently transpired in

156
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:29,254
the story. The party, after completing their
business in the city of Vasselheim, on the far-off

157
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:37,082
northwest continent. Grog, of course, having an
epic battle in the Crucible fight pit against

158
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,547
Kern, reclaiming his honor.

159
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:42,443
TRAVIS: (singing) I am the champion, my friends.

160
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:50,215
MATT: Pike left back there to finish up the renovation of
the temple of Sarenrae that was discovered. The

161
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:54,999
rest of the party moved on back to Emon, the rest
of their business complete. Within Emon, they

162
00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:02,352
returned to Greyskull Keep, where they encountered a
fan, apparently, of Vox Machina, that had been

163
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:08,616
camping for two weeks outside, who was promptly
bludgeoned in the temple by Vax to teach him a

164
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:18,938
lesson. Brought back from the brink, and taught
that hard lesson-- that this is a dangerous

165
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:24,975
field-- managed to seemingly reach out and touch
the heart of this young, intrepid, wannabe

166
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:28,895
adventurer to possibly try and better himself before he
throws himself into danger's way. And he

167
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,091
ran off to train harder.

168
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,507
TALIESIN: Dagger, dagger, hug.

169
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:38,361
MATT: Indeed. Upon returning to the keep, notice
was sent off to one of the other members of the

170
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:47,807
Council of Tal'Dorei, Seeker Asum, who is the halfling
head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge

171
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:57,045
across the countryside, who came to you notifying
you that within a week's time, the Briarwoods, Lord and

172
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:02,485
Lady Briarwood, are supposed to be arriving here
within Emon for a feast to discuss building a

173
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:10,723
bridge and a more political joining between Emon,
the Tal'Dorei royal family, and these

174
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:20,937
up-and-coming lords and ladies, who have a very
dark history with Percy's character. You've been

175
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:25,088
asked to join as part of this feast as you
previously requested with sovereign Tal'Dorei, that

176
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:28,629
should anything involved the Briarwoods that you
be included. You have a week to figure out what

177
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:31,859
you want to do in advance of that. And that is
where we left off.

178
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:34,312
ORION: What time of the day is it?

179
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:39,155
MATT: Right now, after this discussion, you guys'
arrival, I'd say it's probably mid-afternoon.

180
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:46,299
First things first, though, after this discussion
with Seeker Asum, who leaves the keep, you do have

181
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:54,321
a brief moment of awkward silence as most of the
people that work within your keep turn to you.

182
00:14:54,321 --> 00:15:02,885
Laina looks about the rest of you and goes, "By
the way, we've been working here for about six

183
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:10,348
"weeks on the pay of four. We're coming close to
our next pay scheme, and you tend to leave

184
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:17,651
"often and for extended periods of time. We would
also like to be paid, if possible."

185
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:27,409
LAURA: Most definitely, dear. Yes. We are definitely
going to pay you. Does anybody remember how much we

186
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:29,413
are supposed to pay them?

187
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,784
ORION: Pardon, what is the total of the staff's
payment?

188
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:38,254
MATT: She thinks to herself for a moment, at which
point you see Erwen, the elderly servant in the

189
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:45,327
back says, "Actually, you had previously said it
was both of our services was 50 gold each for the

190
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:52,217
"month. And if I recall, the other mercenaries or
guardians that you've hired to watch the walls of

191
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:58,174
"the keep were at a discussed 100 gold for the
month's wages. Each."

192
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,277
LAURA: And how many of those guys do we have?

193
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:08,205
MATT: "You currently have five on your payroll,
yes. 600 gold pieces total per month for the

194
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,272
"services for everyone keeping your keep."

195
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:16,847
LAURA: Tell you what, I will front this from my
personal funds for this month. Just because we

196
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:20,151
don't have enough in the party funds to cover
that.

197
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,721
SAM: We don't have 600 gold?

198
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:22,580
LAURA: We do not!

199
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,698
SAM: Who's our treasurer?!

200
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:26,340
LAURA: I am, but you bitches keep spending money!

201
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,623
LIAM: I'll go halfsies.

202
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:34,743
LAURA: Halfsies? Lovely. Twinsies will pay
halfsies. Here you go! 300 for each.

203
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,961
MATT: "Thank you so much. I'll make sure this gets
to the appropriate individuals immediately.

204
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:40,427
"They'll be very happy to not have to walk away. "

205
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:45,451
LAURA: Yes, don't worry, you will always be paid
from Vox Machina.

206
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:52,961
MATT: Erwen steps in. "And by the way, if you do
intend to leave for an extended period of time

207
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:59,208
"again, I would recommend perhaps paying that in
advance. There was a bit of unrest last time."

208
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,958
SAM: Should we pay another month?

209
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,537
LAURA: Not yet. Not just yet.

210
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:07,457
ORION: I'll pay him in advance right now, just to
get it out of the way. 600, out of here, phew,

211
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:08,793
there you go.

212
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:12,485
MATT: "Very well, sire! I shall disseminate this
amongst the others."

213
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:16,656
TALIESIN: Traditionally, the head of the house
does dispense out the stipends anyway. That would

214
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,934
be appropriate. I'm not even in the room, am I?
Never mind! Sorry.

215
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,543
MATT: Yeah, you're down in the workshop.

216
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,363
LAURA: Can I go find Percy?

217
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:25,579
MATT: You can.

218
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,910
MARISHA: Actually, we should all go find Percy. We
should all talk to Percy.

219
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,276
MATT: "Thank you kindly, Tiberius. Thank you." And
he wanders off and begins counting out change into

220
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,952
a smaller purse.

221
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:40,695
ORION: When they start to go, I'd like to go to
the temple with the sigils and talk to the guy who

222
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:41,899
runs the place.

223
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:45,775
MATT: Oh, you mean the Lyceum?

224
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:46,872
ORION: Yeah.

225
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:48,500
MATT: Okay, the Alabaster Lyceum.

226
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:55,855
ORION: Yeah, because I learned something new this
week and I was like, I'm dumb. But that's where I

227
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:57,126
would like to head.

228
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:01,406
MATT: All right. So you make your way towards the
Alabaster Lyceum. The rest of you head down into

229
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:07,031
Percy's workshop. So you head around the outskirts of the
inner portion of the keep itself, down the

230
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,801
stairway that leads to the basement floor, which
contains a small cell, like a holding cell that

231
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:17,438
you had constructed for you in case you had
somebody to take prisoner at some point. To the right.

232
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:22,220
To the left of you, there's a small turning
hallway that leads to the workshop. The workshop

233
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:32,099
contains a series of various tools, workbenches.
It actually has a working forge, with anvil and

234
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,884
various blacksmithing tools. And as you guys come
down, the heat is already blasting from it, and

235
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:39,762
you can see Percy madly diving into work of some
kind.

236
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:47,407
TRAVIS: What are you doing, Percy? You making more
mousetraps? Guess not.

237
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:53,032
TALIESIN: I'm a bit busy. I am making more ammo.
I'm working on a few projects that have been

238
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,540
rolling around in my head for quite some time
now.

239
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,628
ORION: (whispers) Don't forget the bolt.

240
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:59,417
TALIESIN: The bolt is on the list, yes.

241
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,707
LAURA: Quite the worker.

242
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,270
TALIESIN: I've got a lot to do.

243
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,846
LAURA: Yes. Darling...

244
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,774
TALIESIN: How many of you are down here right
now?

245
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,632
TRAVIS: I think we're all here. I'm moving through
his stuff.

246
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,943
LAURA: I let Trinket forage around the courtyard,
so he's not down here at the moment.

247
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,524
LIAM: I think we need a little history lesson
here--

248
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,754
TALIESIN: Grog, don't touch that!

249
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:22,159
TRAVIS: Why not? But it moves!

250
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,447
LAURA: Don't touch anything.

251
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:28,494
ORION: Matthew, I took some fine meats before I
left and I'm feeding them to

252
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:29,895
Lockheed along the way.

253
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:34,845
MATT: Okay. Lockheed enjoys them thoroughly.
They're delicious. Comfort food crafted by the

254
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,059
finest of cooks in Greyskull Keep.

255
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:43,891
MARISHA: Percy, it's hard not to clearly notice
that you're quite distressed, and we're concerned.

256
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:49,983
And you know, we were talking about it-- not that
we were talking about you or anything, behind your

257
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:55,530
back or anything-- but we never really found out
why you were in that

258
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,969
prison cell when we found you.

259
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:02,948
LIAM: We've never questioned it before. We've
never wanted to make you uncomfortable. But we're

260
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:10,045
about to walk into a party, and I feel like we
need a bit of a history lesson.

261
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:18,532
TALIESIN: Ugh. I know you're right. (sighs)

262
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:22,375
TRAVIS: Should we guess? Was it public nudity?

263
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:29,300
TALIESIN: A bit. I've never had to say this out
loud before. I've never actually had this

264
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,813
discussion with anyone.

265
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:35,226
SAM: It's okay. It gets better.

266
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:39,032
TALIESIN: Do I get an inspiration die for that?

267
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:41,013
MATT: I'll give you a d6 inspiration die.

268
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:44,994
(laughter)

269
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:55,802
TALIESIN: The Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood,
are responsible for the death of my entire family.

270
00:20:55,802 --> 00:21:06,844
Whitestone was my home. Many years ago-- I don't
want to get into the details. I came from a big

271
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:18,540
family. I came from a proud family. One night,
they were invited into our home, and over the

272
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:27,931
course of that night, they slaughtered everybody.
They are evil. They are corrupting. The few

273
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:37,964
survivors of Castle Whitestone who did survive
only survived through deceit and by working for

274
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:46,477
the Briarwoods, turning on their masters.
Thankfully, the de Rolo family still has standing

275
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:55,522
elsewhere, and there's other branches of the
family other than my father's. (sighs) I was lost

276
00:21:55,522 --> 00:22:01,046
for quite a while after that happened. I had
nothing else in my life other than my family. I

277
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:15,683
was never really going to inherit anything. I was
not going to run anything. I was idle. And at some

278
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:26,410
point, I made the decision that, if nothing else,
I survived to, maybe, extract some vengeance.

279
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:37,924
Maybe set something right. Maybe stop whatever it
was that they were doing. I don't know. There was

280
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:47,648
one of their party, Dr. Ripley. She was in charge
of something during the murder. I don't know what.

281
00:22:47,648 --> 00:23:03,286
I chased her. I chased her down. It took a year,
and I had my gun, and I discovered where she was

282
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:14,585
and where she was working on some ruins, and I
approached her. I never even saw her face. Her

283
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:21,533
guards captured me, beat me up. Didn't even bother
taking my things. They just threw me in that

284
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:27,533
dungeon. I never even got close enough to see her
face.

285
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,596
SAM: You know her name, but you've never seen her
before?

286
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:34,159
TALIESIN: I saw her when she was interrogating me
in my home.

287
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,888
SAM: Oh, so you could recognize her.

288
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:36,989
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

289
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:41,715
LAURA: How did you get away when they-- with the
rest of your family?

290
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:57,894
TALIESIN: My sister Cassandra, my younger sister.
She somehow evaded capture. I don't know how. She

291
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:06,289
set me free. I don't know what became of her. I
don't know what became of any of my siblings.

292
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:14,196
Probably nothing reasonable. Nothing good.

293
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:17,731
LIAM: You witnessed none of these deaths?

294
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:23,969
TALIESIN: I saw bodies of a few of them. It's all
a bit shady. It's all a bit of a blur.

295
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:26,157
SAM: How many years ago was this?

296
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:30,331
TALIESIN: (sighs) Four now. Five now.

297
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:35,904
LAURA: If you know that they murdered your family,
how are they still part of society?

298
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:45,604
TALIESIN: I don't know. (sighs) I could have gone
home. I could have gone home at any point, at this

299
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:51,652
point. I'm scared.

300
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:55,206
MARISHA: Did they take over Whitestone? Are they
still there?

301
00:24:55,206 --> 00:25:00,703
TALIESIN: I discovered approximately a week ago
that they're still at Whitestone.

302
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:02,648
LAURA: Will they recognize you?

303
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:03,781
TALIESIN: I don't know.

304
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:06,350
TRAVIS: And these pricks are in good standing with
the council?

305
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:13,963
TALIESIN: (sighs) I don't know what to do. I'm
preparing for anything. When I got thrown into

306
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:25,405
that dungeon, I came to the realization that maybe
I wasn't doing this the right way. I wasn't being

307
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:35,576
responsible, and I prayed to whatever it is I pray
to that maybe I would have a sign of what I should

308
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:44,789
be doing, and then there you were. I've been
trusting that Vox Machina will take me where I

309
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:49,340
need to go, and maybe what I need to do is
confront this, but I don't know what this is,

310
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,455
and I'm terrified.

311
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:58,031
LIAM: And the remains of your family, were they
killed by the sword?

312
00:25:58,031 --> 00:26:11,390
TALIESIN: I don't know. There was an
interrogation. Dr. Ripley was asking questions. I

313
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,911
assumed, for all these years, that that's what
became of my family.

314
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:21,919
MARISHA: What was she asking questions about? What
did they want? Was it just a political coup?

315
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,464
TALIESIN: Asking questions about the castle, about
things about the castle. It was a long time ago,

316
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:35,902
and I was not equipped for torture. I don't
remember much.

317
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:37,779
TRAVIS: Do you want them dead?

318
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:40,335
TALIESIN: I think so.

319
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:44,332
LAURA: Should we interrogate them first? Find out
more about your family?

320
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:47,979
TRAVIS: Or just skip ahead to the dead part?

321
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:55,502
TALIESIN: I put down my gun, and I turn the
barrel, and of the six barrels, five of them have

322
00:26:55,502 --> 00:27:01,651
names, and Lord and Lady Briarwood are two of
those names. Dr. Ripley is another.

323
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,666
SAM: What are the other ones?

324
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,477
TALIESIN: Sir Stonefell is the other, and
Professor Anders is the other, and then there's

325
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:07,669
one blank one.

326
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,933
LAURA: Are they all members of the same party?
They travel with the Briarwoods?

327
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,349
TALIESIN: I don't know.

328
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:22,116
MARISHA: Wait, what were the names? The
Briarwoods, Ripley, Sir Kerrion Stonefell.

329
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:23,555
Who is he?

330
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:25,800
TALIESIN: He was the captain of their guard.

331
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,207
MARISHA: And Professor Anders? Who's that?

332
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:38,358
TALIESIN: Professor Anders was my teacher. He was
my tutor, and he was in collusion with them, and

333
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:44,122
he was the one that I believe allowed them to take
the castle in the night.

334
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:49,934
MARISHA: And do you remember why they were invited
to Whitestone to begin with?

335
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:58,014
TALIESIN: They were traveling. They were on the
road. It was my brother Julius and my sister

336
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:05,981
Vesper who handled matters of court. I was
studying. I didn't think.

337
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:08,888
MARISHA: And how many brothers and sisters do you
have?

338
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,186
TALIESIN: I had six.

339
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:14,857
LAURA: You might have six. We don't know what
happened to them.

340
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:18,054
MARISHA: You said you saw a few bodies of family?

341
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:26,799
TALIESIN: It's all very much a blur. (sighs)
There's things you just forget.

342
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:35,327
SAM: Well, this is certainly tragic, but looking
forward, what do we know of this meeting? Event?

343
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,253
Party? What are we doing?

344
00:28:37,253 --> 00:28:40,952
LAURA: Well, I think we need to do some spying.

345
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:44,479
SAM: Well, do they know Percy's among us?

346
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,487
LAURA: That's the thing. I don't know if they do.

347
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:48,610
TALIESIN: You don't have to get involved in this.

348
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,793
LAURA: Oh, we are so involved.

349
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:54,167
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah, we do. You said you want
them dead.

350
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,929
LAURA: We've got your back, darling.

351
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:03,117
LIAM: Percival, you don't really have a choice in
the matter. My sister and I know a little piece of

352
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:09,102
your pain. I'm not going to get into it, but
there's nothing she and I can do. We can find

353
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:11,864
reparations for you. We will.

354
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:14,996
MARISHA: Percy, is this what you want?

355
00:29:14,996 --> 00:29:17,636
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

356
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,599
TRAVIS: Yeah.

357
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,365
SAM: And if we kill them, how much will you pay
us? Just kidding. We ask other people that.

358
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:37,124
LAURA: Something I do need to know. Percy. If we
see them, and we're not ready to show our faces,

359
00:29:37,124 --> 00:29:39,611
will you be able to contain yourself?

360
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,955
TALIESIN: I think so.

361
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,166
MARISHA: And would they be able to recognize your
face?

362
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:48,394
TALIESIN: Which is why I was planning on-- I know
we have a cap of disguise.

363
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:49,983
TRAVIS: Oh! We do.

364
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:51,138
LAURA: Scanlan has it.

365
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:55,369
TALIESIN: I don't even know if they would
recognize me. My hair was different.

366
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:58,070
LAURA: Less purple?

367
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:06,273
SAM: We could go into town, and find you a bushy
mustache. It's worked for me many times.

368
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,893
TALIESIN: I don't think I wear one as well as you
do.

369
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:11,163
LIAM: How does that cap work?

370
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:18,452
SAM: Well, that cap is more of a hat. While
wearing this hat you can use an action to cast

371
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:24,013
Disguise spell. Oh. Cast a Disguise spell? Do you
have to be a spellcaster to use it?

372
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,859
MATT: You do not have to, no.

373
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,253
SAM: Okay.

374
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:31,342
TRAVIS: I see a shiny tool. I don't know what it
does.

375
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:35,382
MATT: You reach over and grab it, and it's a large
set of tongs, used for gripping large, heavy

376
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:39,492
pieces of metal, either for the actual forge
itself, or to bend

377
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:41,850
and manipulate on the workbench.

378
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,727
TRAVIS: I take it (yawns) and put it in the Bag of
Holding.

379
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,343
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

380
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:51,079
MARISHA: Stealing from the workshop that you
partially own?

381
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:54,850
TRAVIS: There are lots of cool stuff in there!
What was the check?

382
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,146
MATT: Sleight of hand.

383
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,129
TRAVIS: Where's sleight of hand-- 17!

384
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:05,511
LAURA: My passive perception is 21.

385
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:10,269
TALIESIN: No, this could be funny, let this
happen.

386
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,287
LAURA: I give him the evil eye.

387
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:15,347
MATT: She gives you the evil eye.

388
00:31:15,347 --> 00:31:17,380
TRAVIS: It hurts. I put it back.

389
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,270
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, what did you pick up,
what did it look like?

390
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,197
TRAVIS: It was a big thing of tongs. I didn't know
what it did, I just wanted it.

391
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:32,535
TALIESIN: A big thing of tongs? What would I have
to roll to find out if it was covered in some

392
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:43,262
basic sulfuric acid? If it was one of the things I
was using for casting.

393
00:31:43,262 --> 00:31:49,717
MATT: Ah, interesting. You know your tools very
well in your workshop, and yeah, the metal is

394
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:52,387
scarred and pockmarked from use with the various
corrosive chemicals.

395
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:55,612
TALIESIN: That'll take about ten minutes to take
effect. All right.

396
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:58,734
(gasping)

397
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:00,592
ORION: Stupid.

398
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:04,838
LAURA: You're not there.

399
00:32:04,838 --> 00:32:10,194
SAM: Well this Hat of Disguise, Percival, it
requires some attunement. I don't know how capable

400
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,332
you are with magical items.

401
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:15,877
TALIESIN: I can find out.

402
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:22,238
LIAM: We got seven days. I can make you look like
anything. I can talk to the right people and get

403
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:26,217
you the right paperwork and you can be anyone and
no one will know a fucking difference.

404
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:28,193
MARISHA: Calm down there.

405
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:31,029
TALIESIN: I can forge paperwork, as well.

406
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,448
LAURA: Oh yes, he can. He's actually the guy we go
to.

407
00:32:34,448 --> 00:32:38,334
MARISHA: He is that guy you meet on the corner of
Sandy Alley.

408
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:43,709
SAM: I can make us all into birds.

409
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,990
TRAVIS: Are we supposed to go meet with the
council right away?

410
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,571
TALIESIN: No, in a week.

411
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:50,854
SAM: What do we do in the week? Prepare. Recon?

412
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:55,840
LAURA: We can do things. How long of a ride is it
to Kraghammer?

413
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,043
MATT: To Kraghammer, on horseback? It's about two
and a half days.

414
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,987
LAURA: Solo style, if you're fast, and back?

415
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:07,049
MATT: Fast and back? I'd say just under two days,
probably.

416
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:08,931
TALIESIN: How about the giant eagle flies?

417
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:10,884
MARISHA: Yeah, what if you're flying?

418
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:15,420
MATT: I'd say, well, the horse is probably a
little bit faster than the eagle.

419
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,921
LAURA: But you don't have to stick to the road as
an eagle.

420
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:23,045
MATT: I'd say it'd put you there about the same
pace, about two days on eagle, because you can just

421
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:27,918
go straight through. I mean, you want to take the
road because you know that there's a lot of

422
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:31,558
dangerous things that wander the wild that are
between there.

423
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:43,541
LAURA: What do you think? Is it stupid to go and
ride hard and try to get there and back before--?

424
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:46,917
SAM: Wait, we're going to get cash and come back?

425
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:51,156
LAURA: We don't all have to go. A couple of us can
make a fast ride.

426
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:56,344
MARISHA: Tiberius is working on it, I have a
feeling deep down inside.

427
00:33:56,344 --> 00:34:01,162
ORION: (laughs) Why would you say that?

428
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:04,377
MATT: You know I deduct points for metagaming.

429
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,067
ORION: I didn't do anything!

430
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:09,580
TALIESIN: I agree we should send someone for the
money. I agree.

431
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,382
SAM: And it won't take us a whole week to prepare
for this party.

432
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:14,363
All we need is a couple disguises.

433
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:17,821
MARISHA: Yeah, but we need to do research. You
barely know who the Briarwoods are.

434
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:23,033
LIAM: We don't know if these people are straight
up gangster, or if there's something supernatural,

435
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:31,372
seriously supernatural, about them. That hat would
probably work on 80% of people, but I don't know.

436
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:34,014
We don't know anything about them.

437
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:37,236
MARISHA: Well, they're not going to recognize any
of us, are they?

438
00:34:37,236 --> 00:34:39,177
SAM: We could go do some recon.

439
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,991
TRAVIS: Besides, have we seen all the brothels in
Emon? I don't think so.

440
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:51,336
SAM: We should do some research, some
reconnaissance while someone goes for the money.

441
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:56,421
LAURA: Or should we wait? I really want the
money.

442
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:59,333
TALIESIN: People get married in my family for
money. I think it's perfectly reasonable.

443
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,083
SAM: Listen, we could all go get the money and be
back in four days, right?

444
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,417
LAURA: No, because some people need to do some
work. We need to send some people off.

445
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,095
SAM: Split the party?

446
00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:08,742
LIAM: Yes.

447
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:11,467
LAURA: Hopefully be back in time.

448
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:17,008
TALIESIN: There's four days. We can each do our
part. Five days.

449
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:20,896
LIAM: Keyleth, can you-- Kiki.

450
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:24,694
MARISHA: Yes? Sorry.

451
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:27,626
LIAM: Can you and Scanlan fly to Kraghammer?

452
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:33,447
MARISHA: Yes. I would like to stop and talk to
Gilmore first, though, before I leave. Do I have

453
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:35,727
time for that? I can fly.

454
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:39,226
LAURA: Our illustrious god just told us it's
better to stick to the road

455
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:41,196
because there's bad things--

456
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:44,912
MARISHA: In the air? There's air traffic? I have
to worry about air traffic?

457
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:47,487
MATT: By horseback, you want to stick to the road.
By air--

458
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:52,278
SAM: By air, though. Check yourself, Kiki--

459
00:35:52,278 --> 00:35:54,881
MARISHA: What?

460
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:57,745
SAM: You, I would assume, use Polymorph as I do.

461
00:35:57,745 --> 00:35:59,988
MARISHA: No, I use my Beast Shaping.

462
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:06,795
SAM: Ooh. That's so sexy. Does that last for
longer than a day?

463
00:36:06,795 --> 00:36:09,132
MARISHA: It lasts as long as I want it to last.

464
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,840
SAM: Damn!

465
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,621
TRAVIS: I go up to the kitchen and look for
something to eat.

466
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:16,383
MARISHA: It's in my blood.

467
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,632
SAM: You can be an animal as long as you want?

468
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:21,533
MARISHA: Where are you going with this, Scanlan?

469
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:31,600
MATT: You can stay in Beast Shape for a number of
hours equal to half your druid level. Five hours

470
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,421
right now, you can transform for.

471
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:39,526
MARISHA: So when I mean as long as I want, I mean,
long enough to where I've never had to really

472
00:36:39,526 --> 00:36:41,487
think about it before now.

473
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:48,700
SAM: Well then, like me, flying there would not be
an option. We'd have to stop, rest, walk, sleep.

474
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,032
LAURA: Yeah, that would slow it down a lot.

475
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:55,473
MARISHA: Well, I could get ten hours, because I
can use two Beast Shaping abilities.

476
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:58,187
LAURA: But that's still a two days' flight--

477
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:02,184
LIAM: Two days is the horse, riding hard. What
about an eagle?

478
00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:06,872
MARISHA: No, I get my druid shapes back after a
short rest.

479
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:08,722
LAURA: Oh, okay.

480
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:10,871
MARISHA: Because Circle of the Moon, bitch.

481
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:15,875
MATT: So you could Beast Shape twice, rest 30
minutes, Beast Shape twice.

482
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:24,118
MARISHA: Can I make a stop first, and then I'll
run an errand?

483
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:27,316
LIAM: We don't really have a lot of money at the
moment.

484
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:28,789
LAURA: She might have some.

485
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,883
MARISHA: Yeah, I've got my personal fundsies.

486
00:37:30,883 --> 00:37:35,205
TALIESIN: Can you leave me an earpiece so that I
can keep in contact? I'm not leaving my workshop.

487
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:36,760
MARISHA: I have an earpiece, right?

488
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,736
LAURA: We'll leave you alone, Percy. To work.

489
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:42,864
MARISHA: Is there anything else you need from us,
Percy? Is there anything you need

490
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:44,272
while I'm out and about?

491
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:46,265
TALIESIN: Leave me an earpiece, and I'll call if I
need anything else.

492
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,649
TRAVIS: Percy, is there anything in this shop that
you want in the Bag of Holding for later?

493
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:51,431
TALIESIN: Not yet. Thank you, Grog.

494
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:53,261
LAURA: Do you not have an earpiece?

495
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:56,680
TRAVIS: I'll give him mine.

496
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:05,254
TALIESIN: How many minutes has it been? I'm
wondering if his hands are starting to itch yet.

497
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:11,051
MATT: About this time, you start to get this weird
tingling sensation around your fingers.

498
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:14,098
TRAVIS: Do they crave blood?

499
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:20,309
MATT: No, they crave some sort of an agent that
will prevent the now slight burning sensation.

500
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:28,912
TRAVIS: Ow. Quick question. Sorry, I kept
something from falling in the shop-- really quick

501
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:33,687
reflexes-- it's making my bits tingle. Do you have
anything for that?

502
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,865
LIAM: You haven't been scratching yourself, have
you?

503
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:40,377
TRAVIS: No, I had that before. Not the same
thing.

504
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:44,218
TALIESIN: There's a bucket of water in the corner.
You can try that.

505
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:46,498
TRAVIS: I go over to the bucket of water and I
stick my hands in the water.

506
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:48,316
TALIESIN: It'll make it worse.

507
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:56,035
MATT: It does. The slight burning sensation now
has turned into a very vibrant burning white hot

508
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:59,967
on the skin, and you can see bits of the skin
start to peel back a little bit,

509
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:01,561
beginning on the edges.

510
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,682
TALIESIN: I hand him a small bag of powder. Now
you've learned not to touch things if you don't

511
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:05,109
know what they are.

512
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,481
TRAVIS: What do I do with a bag of powder?

513
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:08,399
TALIESIN: I pour the powder on his hands.

514
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:12,512
MATT: It foams up a little bit in places, but it
is neutralized.

515
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:15,999
TRAVIS: Yeah.

516
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,044
TALIESIN: You're a good friend.

517
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:23,092
TRAVIS: Can I leave now? I go to the kitchen to
eat.

518
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:29,713
MATT: All righty. You easily get another meal
mustered for you.

519
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:32,226
MARISHA: I'm going to go make a trip to Gilmore's.
Anybody want to join?

520
00:39:32,226 --> 00:39:34,810
LIAM: I should probably tag along.

521
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:39,340
SAM: I'll come, too.

522
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,255
MATT: You're working in the workshop, you're
eating, you guys are going to Gilmore's. All

523
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:49,860
right. So as this is happening, Tiberius, you make
your way over to the Alabaster Lyceum. You come up

524
00:39:49,860 --> 00:40:00,349
to the front main area of the structure itself.
It's an arcane college. You make your way to the

525
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:06,217
front clerk, who looks up to you, a nice young
fellow, looks like he's trying to work through his

526
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:10,139
credit in school through his training. He's
dressed in the ceremonial robes of somebody who is

527
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:16,039
a student, who is currently stuck with the job of
working as a clerk. He's like,

528
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,705
"Hi, can I help you?"

529
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:28,386
ORION: Yes, hi, if you do not remember me, I am
Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox

530
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,931
Machina, over at Greyskull Keep.

531
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,438
MATT: "Where have I heard that--"

532
00:40:33,438 --> 00:40:40,309
ORION: Well, we told you multiple times before. We
met with you using your sigil of teleport-- it's

533
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:47,840
fine. I've come here on a matter of business
anyway, so that's neither here nor there. I was

534
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:58,052
wondering if I may procure an address, or number
as it were, for a sigil to Kraghammer. I believe

535
00:40:58,052 --> 00:41:04,147
the Thunderbrands would have some facility near
theirs or on their own premises where their sigil

536
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:08,707
could be channeled through the Circle of
Teleportation spell.

537
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:13,714
MATT: "If you're talking about sigils for
teleportation, you would probably have to discuss

538
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:15,751
"that with Gatekeeper Xanthas."

539
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:19,486
ORION: Where is he? I thought that was you.

540
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:27,554
MATT: "No. I'm the clerk. I run the front of the--
follow me." And he gets up and leads you further

541
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:36,213
into the structure to the central circular room,
the white-marbled room that contains all the doors

542
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:42,930
around, and in the center there is the Traverse
Junction. This is the place you guys have stumbled

543
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:49,741
into every single time you've teleported back to
Emon. And there you see the elven wizard who you

544
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:56,754
recently bothered naught but maybe five hours ago,
who is currently setting up some sheets, comes

545
00:41:56,754 --> 00:42:00,961
back. "Oh. Hello, again."

546
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:10,442
ORION: Hi. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia.
Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep. I

547
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:16,103
was wondering-- and I asked your clerk here
because I thought he did what you actually do

548
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:35,069
here-- if I may procure, for coin or perhaps some
kind of favor of sorts, the address or number or

549
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:44,272
code or whatever it is that would work for the
Kraghammer sigil of my Circle of Teleportation.

550
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:50,381
MATT: "I get an understanding here that you're
seeking access to one of our many sigil-based

551
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:58,105
"rooms of transference. Those rooms are currently
under very protected lock and key, approval by the

552
00:42:58,105 --> 00:43:00,632
"headmaster Thurmond Adalum himself."

553
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:02,684
ORION: Okay, where is he?

554
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:06,701
MARISHA: Oh my god. It's like calling Time Warner
Cable.

555
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:11,079
ORION: Can you take me to him? Where is he at?

556
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:19,414
MATT: Glances over at the clerk, who goes, "Right
this way, Mr. Stormwind." He leads you back to a

557
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:27,269
long, long hallway with arched ceiling. You can
see the marble itself has these carvings and

558
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:33,643
sculptures of various dead-looking faces of
long-passed mages that either were built or held

559
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:41,046
in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum. At the
very end, it opens up into a pretty

560
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:48,628
well-decorated, almost over-the-top decorated
office room for the headmaster himself. The

561
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:55,365
interior is lined with large, large 15,
20-foot-tall bookshelves around this oval room

562
00:43:55,365 --> 00:44:01,962
with sliding ladders that are attached to them
that slowly glide on their own, like they're on

563
00:44:01,962 --> 00:44:07,267
some sort of arcane-based pattern that puts them
back and forth. There is a large chandelier of

564
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:15,004
brightly colored orbs that sits 35, 40 feet in the
air, that slowly rotates on its own that keeps

565
00:44:15,004 --> 00:44:20,457
this slowly fluctuating changing color of the
room. And in the center there is a circular desk,

566
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:26,349
and sitting there at the desk you can see is
Headmaster Thurmond, who is this extremely elderly

567
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:36,155
human male. Shaved face, very short, curved bald
head with a little bit of hair in the back,

568
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:40,556
hunched forward and is currently collecting a
series of books into his arms. Looks like he's

569
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:43,953
about to get up. And he turns and looks over. "Can
I help you?"

570
00:44:43,953 --> 00:44:45,690
ORION: Hello.

571
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,017
ORION and SAM: I'm Tiberius Stormwind from
Draconia.

572
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:56,731
ORION: Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull
Keep here in Emon. We are the saviors of this town

573
00:44:56,731 --> 00:45:03,629
and whatnot. Anyway, that's neither here nor
there. I went through this fellow, who I thought

574
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:11,458
was the job of this fellow, but it wasn't either
of those jobs, it was you who I've been needing to

575
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,043
talk to, I'm assuming?

576
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,213
MATT: "What do you require from me, then?"

577
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:25,304
ORION: I'm hoping to procure an address or access
to the sigils of Kraghammer through my Circle of

578
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:31,330
Teleportation spell and whatnot using your arcane
gates. That's about it.

579
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,519
(laughter)

580
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,504
SAM: Well put!

581
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:44,350
MATT: "If you're asking for access to one of our
closely guarded sigils for the Thunderbrands, you

582
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,742
"say, within Kraghammer?"

583
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:48,264
ORION: Yes, yes. We'll have to speak with them as
well.

584
00:45:48,264 --> 00:45:53,954
MATT: "Well, then I will-- just one moment." And
he reaches into a pouch and pulls out this mirror,

585
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:59,761
this oval mirror and sets it onto his desk.
Reaches underneath and pulls out a small chest.

586
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:03,358
Opens up the chest, and you can see in this chest
that there are probably two dozen of these tiny

587
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,519
little marbles, all different colors, some
different shapes, and he goes, these little labels

588
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,441
you can't really see from your perspective. He
takes one out, places it in the top of the mirror,

589
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:16,219
and as he does, the mirror all of a sudden
shimmers for a second, and what was originally a

590
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:24,372
normal reflection is now this light, glowing blue,
slightly glowing water-like surface. He takes it

591
00:46:24,372 --> 00:46:34,926
and lifts it up to himself. "Hello. Hello? Hello!"
A moment later, you hear this distant voice

592
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:41,653
echoing with this strange warbling filter over it.
"I'm coming, what's taking your time. Yes,

593
00:46:41,653 --> 00:46:44,265
"Headmaster, what do you require?"

594
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:57,787
"Well, there's a gentleman here, dragonborn, who
is requesting use of your sigil of teleportation.

595
00:46:57,787 --> 00:47:04,065
"Do you know this gentleman?" Turns it around, and
you can see in there, this is the same

596
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:13,350
long-bearded dwarven individual that met you at
the actual Thunderbrand house, and had a bit of an

597
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,736
argument with you early in your travels in
Kraghammer.

598
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:22,836
ORION: We've got things for you, this time, like
we said we would get for you. In the Underdark.

599
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:28,488
It's really inconvenient, but we have things that
we need to get to you quickly.

600
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:36,615
MATT: "Now, listen here. Last we spoke, you and
your friends stormed into our lair, nearly

601
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:40,804
"destroyed our precious arcane defenses of our
homestead--"

602
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:45,271
ORION: He was drinking. He's an alcoholic. He's
got help since then.

603
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:46,874
MATT: Make a deception check.

604
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:52,952
ORION: What is it?

605
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:59,529
MATT: This is deception. Well, you are an
alcoholic, but that wasn't what he meant.

606
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:01,675
ORION: 20.

607
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:14,386
MATT: 20. (laughs) He goes, "Either way, we can't
just let anyone willy-nilly knowing how to directly

608
00:48:14,386 --> 00:48:17,343
"appear in the center of our homestead."

609
00:48:17,343 --> 00:48:21,039
ORION: (in same accent as Matt) Of course. Oh,
sorry, I started to sound like you.

610
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,410
(laughter)

611
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,960
TALIESIN: Bring me another accent, aye.

612
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:42,115
ORION: Of course. I wouldn't expect you to. I'm
Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. My father

613
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:55,486
Kruvanis Stormwind has helped the Council for over
two generations. We come from a noble house, and I

614
00:48:55,486 --> 00:49:02,676
give you my word that I will never abuse--
abuse?-- however you pronounce it in your tongue.

615
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:11,696
The privilege of quickly traveling to your stead
to do business with you, and there would be no

616
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:16,765
other intrusion otherwise. I guarantee it as my
name as a Stormwind.

617
00:49:16,765 --> 00:49:18,878
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

618
00:49:18,878 --> 00:49:21,494
SAM: Chief negotiator!

619
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:24,463
ORION: That's 11.

620
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:34,342
MATT: 11. His head turns to the side a little bit,
peering through you with a slight scowl. "Last we

621
00:49:34,342 --> 00:49:39,113
"talked, the reason we didn't report you to the
guard for breaking through our defenses was you

622
00:49:39,113 --> 00:49:43,798
"promised to look beneath the city and bring back
various artifacts you were in search of."

623
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:45,224
ORION: Ooh, we found one!

624
00:49:45,224 --> 00:49:46,332
MATT: "Did you, now?"

625
00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:48,972
ORION: A couple, yes. And we killed a bunch of
those buttholes.

626
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:53,029
MATT: "Can I see one of these artifacts?"

627
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:56,454
ORION: I don't have it on me right now.

628
00:49:56,454 --> 00:50:02,539
MATT: "We're done here, Headmaster." And the
mirror shimmers and closes suddenly.

629
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:04,633
MARISHA: Wait. No?

630
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:05,908
LIAM: Good try!

631
00:50:05,908 --> 00:50:08,738
LAURA: We can bring-- oh, we're not there.

632
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:11,950
MATT: The headmaster takes the marble out and
says,

633
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,626
"I'm sorry that didn't seem to go your way."

634
00:50:14,626 --> 00:50:20,724
ORION: It's fine, Headmaster. I'll be back in
about 15 minutes with the proper proof that we did

635
00:50:20,724 --> 00:50:26,289
procure the things that the man, that needed to
have proof, did. Excuse me! And I get the hell out

636
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:31,914
of there. And as soon as I get out of there, I
cast Fly on myself, and I Gandalf (whoosh) right

637
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:33,508
back to the keep.

638
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:43,085
MATT: All righty. You're eating. You're crafting.
Are you going with the rest of them to Gilmore?

639
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:45,726
LAURA: I don't know. I guess so.

640
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:50,984
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the
outside of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

641
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:54,622
SAM: As we walk, do we see Tiberius fly over our
heads?

642
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:57,811
LAURA: Actually, I'm staying at the Keep.

643
00:50:57,811 --> 00:51:02,591
ORION: Well, Travis is my target, right? Are you
still at the Keep?

644
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:04,076
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm eating.

645
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:08,149
MATT: As far as time goes, you haven't quite
gotten to that point yet, for these guys. You get

646
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:14,283
to Gilmore's. You enter the interior. You can see
that for the most part, there aren't a lot of

647
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:18,450
people in here. It's getting later in the day, and
a lot of the customer business seems to be

648
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:24,715
happening almost earlier, either pre-noon, or
around noon. There's no current sign of Gilmore.

649
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:31,582
You do see, across the way-- what's her name,
again?

650
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:33,142
MARISHA: Sherri.

651
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:40,952
MATT: Thank you. Sherri, the mousy helper who runs
the shop in Gilmore's absence, or at least runs

652
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:44,537
the first portion of it, with her thick glasses up
on her nose, and she's sitting there with her

653
00:51:44,537 --> 00:51:56,135
elbows over the top of the main desk. She looks up
as you enter, and takes her glasses and pokes them

654
00:51:56,135 --> 00:52:00,237
for a second. "Hello? Hi."

655
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:01,765
LIAM: Do you remember us?

656
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:03,397
MATT: "Right, I do."

657
00:52:03,397 --> 00:52:10,171
MARISHA: From Vox Machina? We're sponsored by
Gilmore. He put the brand on my armor that my

658
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:11,624
mother gave me.

659
00:52:11,624 --> 00:52:16,938
MATT: "And you should be wearing it proudly, yes?
Now, what can I help you with?"

660
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:19,166
SAM: Well, is Gilmore around?

661
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:24,696
LIAM: Yes, I was hoping to catch up with him.
We've been gone a while, and I was hoping to trade

662
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:28,221
news with Glorious Gilmore. Is he not in at the
moment?

663
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:34,338
MATT: "Gilmore's in Westruun, currently setting up
the expansion of the Gilmore's Glorious Goods

664
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:38,585
"business. If this is important, I can certainly
summon him here."

665
00:52:38,585 --> 00:52:46,864
LIAM: I'd hate to pull him away from business. I
don't want to get in the way of his business. I

666
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:57,907
mean, I am rather sad not to see him, but no, I
don't think that would be a course of action we'd

667
00:52:57,907 --> 00:53:00,853
want to take. Let him continue to set up.

668
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:02,490
MATT: "All right, I suppose."

669
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,074
LIAM: Can you get a message to him, though?

670
00:53:04,074 --> 00:53:05,440
MATT: "Yes, I can, actually."

671
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,560
LIAM: Well, tell him Vax'ildan and friends
visited. We're in the city for a week.

672
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,792
MATT: She pulls out a small sheet of what looks
like a rough-around-the-edges piece of parchment,

673
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,719
and starts the inkwell, scribbling down.

674
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:23,265
LIAM: Vax'ildan. That's with an A, not an E. We're
here for a week. I don't know if he's going to be

675
00:53:23,265 --> 00:53:30,795
back from Westruun before then, but if he is, tell
him to get word to me. I'm very interested in

676
00:53:30,795 --> 00:53:33,829
exchanging news for the past few weeks.

677
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:40,282
MATT: "All right." (foreign words) It flashes and
disappears in front of her. "Well then, he'll be

678
00:53:40,282 --> 00:53:46,287
"receiving the message right about now. We'll pass
that on, and whenever he returns, I'm certain he

679
00:53:46,287 --> 00:53:50,694
"will get back to you and deal with whatever
business is necessary."

680
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:54,319
LIAM: Thank you. We're here late in the day; are
you still open for business?

681
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,129
MATT: "We are open, yes."

682
00:53:56,129 --> 00:54:02,819
MARISHA: I was just curious if you guys had a
chance to think about the alchemy workshop that we

683
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:10,391
talked about before, or if you maybe had any
alchemy books that came in that I was requesting?

684
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:16,804
MATT: "It's possible. We haven't completely
restocked the shelves, as of late. I know we had

685
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:22,402
"some new things come in. I can go check." And as
she turns, all of a sudden there's a large,

686
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:29,007
vibrant, white flash of light and a sound from the
back room. The beaded curtains shift, for a

687
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:34,496
second, and you hear heavy footsteps. And pushing
through the beaded curtain, you see before you,

688
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:43,396
with a bead of sweat on his head, Gilmore! "I'm so
glad you came back!"

689
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:45,718
SAM and MARISHA: Gilmore!

690
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:50,953
MATT: "I'm sorry. I was out and about, running
some business a ways away."

691
00:54:50,953 --> 00:54:53,674
LIAM: You didn't have to go to all that trouble to
come back here.

692
00:54:53,674 --> 00:54:58,358
MATT: "How could I miss seeing my fine-- there's
not as many of you as usual."

693
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:02,544
LIAM: No, we're seeing to different bits of
business. I turn back to him, I walk forward with

694
00:55:02,544 --> 00:55:08,803
hands out. I walk up to him, take him by the head,
give him a good European-style kiss just about here--

695
00:55:08,803 --> 00:55:15,934
right there-- come back, and say, there is so much
to talk about. Where can we be alone?

696
00:55:15,934 --> 00:55:25,508
MATT: He looks over at the rest of the group.
"Well, I mean--"

697
00:55:25,508 --> 00:55:28,305
(laughter)

698
00:55:28,305 --> 00:55:30,253
MATT "But of course."

699
00:55:30,253 --> 00:55:32,977
LIAM: See to whatever business you need to.

700
00:55:32,977 --> 00:55:36,098
SAM: We'll just peruse, yeah. We'll window shop.

701
00:55:36,098 --> 00:55:40,946
MATT: He walks back through the beaded curtain,
giving you this look over his shoulder. As he

702
00:55:40,946 --> 00:55:43,201
does, the curtain falls behind him.

703
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:45,114
LIAM: Those beads.

704
00:55:45,114 --> 00:55:47,529
TRAVIS: Oh jeez!

705
00:55:47,529 --> 00:55:49,518
LIAM: I walk right in. Follow him in.

706
00:55:49,518 --> 00:55:59,493
MATT: And you can see now, as the glow gently
fades, there is a rug that is pushed to the side,

707
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:05,289
and on the floor of his room there is a familiar
sigil, similar to the one that you've seen

708
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:11,112
Tiberius scrawl before in some of his spells.
That's apparently how he got here so quickly. But

709
00:56:11,112 --> 00:56:14,924
he walks in, and he kicks the rug back over it,
sits down on the edge of his bed, puts his hands

710
00:56:14,924 --> 00:56:20,062
up and goes, "What seems to be troubling you?"

711
00:56:20,062 --> 00:56:28,499
LIAM: I walk over and I sit down opposite him, and
I say: Before we talk about anything, I feel like

712
00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:35,541
I should apologize because although we didn't have
any sort of written agreement, you and I are

713
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:37,665
friends, aren't we?

714
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:38,895
MATT: "Yes."

715
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:47,693
LIAM: And I was supposed to help bring your brand
wherever we went. And I thought that would be

716
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:58,832
possible. We came back from the Underdark. We had
a very hard time, some of the hardest weeks of my

717
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:08,305
life. I haven't delivered on my promise. And I
mean to, but I haven't yet. I apologize

718
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:10,786
wholeheartedly. I'm sorry.

719
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:24,516
MATT: "That's all right. I understand: people grow
busy. There are things you must tend to, and

720
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:28,826
"that's all right. And I appreciate you being so
honest, I really do."

721
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:35,829
LIAM: In addition to that, I am changed, and
promises mean more to me, even more than they did

722
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:47,398
before. And I promise to follow through. In the
interest of time for the game, DM, Vax tells the

723
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:53,236
whole story of the Underdark, of the horn, of how
close it was.

724
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,669
MARISHA: Ugh, what is taking him so long,
Scanlan?

725
00:57:55,669 --> 00:57:57,385
SAM: I don't know.

726
00:57:57,385 --> 00:58:02,580
MATT: While that's happening, the rest of you are
left there awkwardly staring about.

727
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,791
MARISHA: Did Sherri find my book? Sherri?

728
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:08,708
MATT: A few minutes go by. Sherri comes back. She
brings two books over.

729
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:14,571
"Best I can tell, these may be what you're
looking for? I can't quite--" She sets them down.

730
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:21,564
One is a book that is the properties of various
liquids, chemicals, and things that are found on

731
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:27,997
this plane and otherwise. It's a good way to
locate and identify phantom liquids, should you

732
00:58:27,997 --> 00:58:29,344
come across any.

733
00:58:29,344 --> 00:58:31,498
MARISHA: That would be good for Scanlan.

734
00:58:31,498 --> 00:58:34,633
TALIESIN: He is the source of a lot of phantom
liquids.

735
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:44,210
MATT: The other book appears to have a section
about alchemy. It's essentially almost a

736
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:47,539
beginner's guide, but it's a very, very
easy-to-follow introduction to a number of

737
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:56,006
various low-level sorceries and the creation of
low-level spell components preparing them for use

738
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:58,928
with spell-casting, and there is a chapter on a
little bit of alchemy.

739
00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:02,218
MARISHA: Okay, how much are these, Sherri?

740
00:59:02,218 --> 00:59:04,508
MATT: "They haven't been priced, yet."

741
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:07,290
MARISHA: I mean, they're-- they're all right.

742
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:13,913
LAURA: Good going, Keyleth! I like it!

743
00:59:13,913 --> 00:59:16,677
MATT: "25 gold, each."

744
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:21,771
MARISHA: 25 gold, each? Oh, come on. I know some
university student dropped these off and donated

745
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:26,044
these. Don't kid me, Sherri. Am I doing it right?
Do I sound like Vex?

746
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:27,959
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

747
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:29,459
MARISHA: Damn it!

748
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:31,798
TALIESIN: I was about to say, make her do a
persuasion roll, it'd be funny.

749
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:34,557
SAM: Unforced error.

750
00:59:34,557 --> 00:59:40,332
TALIESIN: I'm sorry!

751
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:45,535
(laughter)

752
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,989
LIAM: I spoke too soon!

753
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:49,365
TRAVIS: So perfect! <i>So</i> perfect for you.

754
00:59:49,365 --> 00:59:53,669
MATT: She reaches out and takes the books and
slides them back, and says, "Well, if that's how

755
00:59:53,669 --> 00:59:58,085
"you feel, perhaps these can be returned to those
university students that perhaps left them by. I

756
00:59:58,085 --> 00:59:59,615
"should put these in the lost and found."

757
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,672
MARISHA: Sherri!

758
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:07,598
SAM: Sherri. If I may. What Keyleth was trying to
say was that she never got a chance to go to

759
01:00:07,598 --> 01:00:14,291
college, and that she wanted to get that
university experience.

760
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:16,485
MATT: "Good luck."

761
01:00:16,485 --> 01:00:22,678
SAM: Well, that didn't work. Hey, can you serve
me, now?

762
01:00:22,678 --> 01:00:28,619
MARISHA: (whispering) Scanlan. Scanlan! Will you
buy those books for me, and I'll reimburse you?

763
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:30,465
MATT: "I can hear you. I'm right here."

764
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:32,118
(laughter)

765
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:33,987
TRAVIS: Walk away!

766
01:00:33,987 --> 01:00:35,924
MATT: "Yes, I'm happy to help you."

767
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:41,383
SAM: I was wondering if you had a small box of
some sort that could carry a magical item, and

768
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:44,352
perhaps shield it from detection.

769
01:00:44,352 --> 01:00:50,671
MATT: "That? Yes, we do have a couple of those.
Hold on." She darts up the stairway in the other

770
01:00:50,671 --> 01:00:55,110
room and goes to the second floor. A few moments
later, she comes back down with these two small

771
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:01,359
chests-- they're about that big, each. One's a
lighter wood color, the other is painted black all

772
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:07,551
over. "We have both of these. They should shield
something of this size from most low-level magical

773
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:12,335
"detections. These will run you about 200 gold
apiece."

774
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:20,527
SAM: I just need one. You're a woman of the world,
and I'm sure you have fine taste, judging by your

775
01:01:20,527 --> 01:01:25,769
appearance. It is quite fine, if I may say so
myself. If I were a little taller, I would

776
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,143
probably ask you out on a date.

777
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:30,804
MATT: "If you were a little taller, yes."

778
01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:32,541
MARISHA: Sherri is sassy today!

779
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:34,263
ORION: She's full of sass!

780
01:01:34,263 --> 01:01:36,597
SAM: Which one is the fancier of the two?

781
01:01:36,597 --> 01:01:40,853
MATT: "Well, looking at these, this one--" She
points to the one that looks like just a casual,

782
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:46,597
wood chest. "This would be easier to hide in plain
sight amongst the rest of your furniture. This

783
01:01:46,597 --> 01:01:53,104
"one, however, would be difficult to locate in a
more shaded, or lightless, circumstance."

784
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:56,657
SAM: Hm. I want ostentatiousness.

785
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:58,700
MATT: "Then perhaps this one?"

786
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:05,578
SAM: Yes, please. That. Thanks. Thank you. 200 to
you. Also, I know Gilmore is otherwise

787
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:12,340
entertained. Can you try to identify something for
me? Do you have that-- I mean, judging by the

788
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:19,260
glint in your eye and beauty in your heart, I'm
sure you have many skills I don't know about, but

789
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:26,124
I'm wondering if you could identify this small,
red vial with a floating something in it, that I

790
01:02:26,124 --> 01:02:33,573
procured quite some time ago! Do you remember
that?

791
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:44,444
MATT: Yes. This vial, if I recall, it has this
small--

792
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:47,075
SAM: Have I tried this, once before?

793
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:49,950
MATT: No, this is the one that was found--

794
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,644
SAM: Me and Pike found some stuff in somebody's
house? I don't even remember,

795
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,185
this was a year ago.

796
01:02:55,185 --> 01:03:04,616
MATT: Right. Yes, okay. There we go. And make a
persuasion roll, actually, on this one.

797
01:03:04,616 --> 01:03:06,677
SAM: A lot.

798
01:03:06,677 --> 01:03:10,058
TALIESIN: Oh, look: a real roll.

799
01:03:10,058 --> 01:03:11,812
MARISHA: Shut up.

800
01:03:11,812 --> 01:03:19,458
SAM: Persuasion? It's 35. Wait, 31. 31.

801
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:22,168
TRAVIS: Matt just visited his mind palace.

802
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:32,499
MATT: She looks at you, and goes, "You have been
good patrons, and you have been much kinder to me

803
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:42,059
"than others. We'll put this one on the house.
We'll call this on the house." And as she takes

804
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:46,261
the vial, sets it down, and she pulls out another
book that she shuffles through, puts it up, turns

805
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:56,889
through a few pages, until, looking through, "This
here would be a Potion of Fire Breath. When

806
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:01,598
"imbibed, it should give you a temporary time
period of the ability to breathe fire, much like a

807
01:04:01,598 --> 01:04:10,237
"relatively young dragon. This one in particular is
fire. There are many different vials like this

808
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:14,602
"that pertain to different colorations of dragon,
but this one is specifically for the red."

809
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:22,748
SAM: Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you
so much. Two more questions, then I'll leave you

810
01:04:22,748 --> 01:04:30,947
alone. One: where can I go get business cards
printed up, in this town? It's a calling card?

811
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:32,393
Never mind! Forget it.

812
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:33,971
MATT: "Like a flyer?"

813
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:35,128
SAM: Yes!

814
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:42,121
MATT: "Those can be printed. There is a--
actually, a pretty well-designed print facility

815
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,661
"not that far up the road."

816
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:48,951
SAM: Oh, great! Thank you; I'll go investigate
that. And one other thing: you know those books

817
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:55,884
that my friend was asking about? Could we maybe
make those happen for her? I know that you had

818
01:04:55,884 --> 01:05:03,261
quoted her a low, low price of 25. I'd be prepared
to pay even more than that for them. And compose

819
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:05,532
you a little song about yourself.

820
01:05:05,532 --> 01:05:10,500
MATT: At which point, for the first time since the
entire time you've been in the shop of Gilmore's

821
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:20,007
Glorious Goods, you see a slight grin creep across
her lips. She goes, "How could a lady say no to a

822
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:23,694
"song? 25 gold! The price stands."

823
01:05:23,694 --> 01:05:26,147
SAM: So I have to pay you and sing to you?

824
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:30,412
MATT: "We run a business, here, yes."

825
01:05:30,412 --> 01:05:32,227
SAM: All right.

826
01:05:32,227 --> 01:05:33,544
MATT: She pulls the books out.

827
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:36,063
SAM: I bring out my-- something.

828
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:38,382
(laughter)

829
01:05:38,382 --> 01:05:54,403
SAM: (sings) Sherri baby, Sherri baby, Sherri,
won't you come home tonight? Come home tonight?

830
01:05:54,403 --> 01:06:14,154
You better ask your mama. Tell her you're without a
gnome! Why don't you come home to my keep!

831
01:06:14,154 --> 01:06:15,723
MATT: "Pay for the books!"

832
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:18,117
SAM: Okay, here you go!

833
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:21,523
MATT: You can see, her face is flushed and she,
(clears throat).

834
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:26,425
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a flower real quick and slip
it to Scanlan to give to her.

835
01:06:26,425 --> 01:06:28,589
SAM: Oh! Here you are.

836
01:06:28,589 --> 01:06:32,892
MATT: "Thank you."

837
01:06:32,892 --> 01:06:36,266
TRAVIS: (gasps) Did she blush?

838
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:43,932
MATT: She's red in the face. At this point in
time, the beaded curtains reopen. Have you

839
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:45,436
finished the conversation, or do you want to keep
going?

840
01:06:45,436 --> 01:06:50,047
LIAM: No. After ten minutes of finishing all that,
of telling every tiny detail, if you mind me

841
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:55,454
backtracking, I briefly place my hand on top of
his, and say, it was terrible. I've never seen

842
01:06:55,454 --> 01:07:04,443
anything like it. Now we're back. We're in our
home, and I'm hoping to learn how Uriel is doing,

843
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:11,826
how the city is faring. Is there any news? Things
are ill in Kraghammer; they still haven't seen the

844
01:07:11,826 --> 01:07:16,201
last of their troubles, but I'm also concerned for
our new home here.

845
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:23,413
MATT: "As far as I'm aware, this city has been
doing rather well. Since Winter's Crest just this

846
01:07:23,413 --> 01:07:28,211
"previous year, trade has been booming, we're
opening up pathways all across the continent,

847
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:34,947
"we've improved relations with many other distant
kingdoms, and I'm opening a second shop! I mean,

848
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:36,540
"that's amazing! And who would've thought?"

849
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,028
LIAM: And Westruun, how's it going?

850
01:07:38,028 --> 01:07:42,208
MATT: "So far, so good. We're going through the
construction process, and I'm making sure that I

851
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:48,963
"have a rather supple income of artifacts and
oddities that I have to sell at both locations. I

852
01:07:48,963 --> 01:07:54,784
"have to widen my input of various items and--"

853
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:56,820
LIAM: You're a busy man.

854
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,238
MATT: "Oh, yes."

855
01:07:58,238 --> 01:07:59,948
LIAM: Have you any time for leisure?

856
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:07,349
MATT: "Eventually." You can see, he's a little
more worn than you've seen Gilmore before. He's

857
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:11,637
still Gilmore, and he's excited, but after the
tale you told him and opening the second shop has

858
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:15,293
been a little rough on him, and his jovial self is
a little more wearied.

859
01:08:15,293 --> 01:08:18,596
Though he still looks fabulous.

860
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:24,118
LIAM: You seem a tad weary. Is there anything I
can do to help you?

861
01:08:24,118 --> 01:08:29,804
MATT: "Just praise the brand. Praise the brand,
young Vax."

862
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:39,464
LIAM: That will happen. I did not even mean to
discuss this, coming here, but I noticed, coming

863
01:08:39,464 --> 01:08:48,553
in, a sigil under your carpet. I had no intention
of this, but we need to get back to Kraghammer in

864
01:08:48,553 --> 01:08:57,491
a bit of a hurry, and I certainly have no
abilities, but do you remember my friend Tiberius?

865
01:08:57,491 --> 01:08:59,147
Dragonborn fellow?

866
01:08:59,147 --> 01:09:01,091
MATT: "Yes! Yes, I remember him."

867
01:09:01,091 --> 01:09:09,846
LIAM: He needs to run an errand back in
Kraghammer. Is there any way you could hook us up

868
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:10,899
with a favor?

869
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:13,683
MATT: "What kind of favor?"

870
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:20,390
LIAM: I just want to send the lizard to Dwarf
Town. Do you think we could make that happen?

871
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:26,049
MARISHA: "Send the lizard to Dwarf Town?" How many
more slurs can you have in one sentence?

872
01:09:26,049 --> 01:09:36,453
MATT: "My sigil here is for returning personal
use. Did you hear that? There was some strange

873
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:47,933
"noise in the sky. This is for my return. As far as
outgoing, most other sigils are-- well, they're up

874
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:52,823
"here. Looking for that, you're going to have to go
to the Lyceum, I'm afraid."

875
01:09:52,823 --> 01:09:54,708
LIAM: Understood. I don't want to push my luck.

876
01:09:54,708 --> 01:10:06,019
MATT: "However, if you're going to the Lyceum... I
am owed a favor or two. Let me see what I can do,

877
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:13,095
"here." And he goes, and he pulls out another piece
of similar paper and he writes a quick little

878
01:10:13,095 --> 01:10:21,747
note on the side, sends it up in the air, and it
vanishes. He goes, "I've just done you a favor.

879
01:10:21,747 --> 01:10:28,870
"Keep that in mind. You go to the Lyceum, you
should have access to one of these sigils. Make

880
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:32,015
"sure you choose properly. You only have one."

881
01:10:32,015 --> 01:10:34,795
LIAM: I'm pretty magic-stupid.

882
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:40,539
MATT: "Then don't be the one that does it. Talk to
your friend, this Tiberius fellow. He'll know what

883
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:41,806
"to do, I'm sure."

884
01:10:41,806 --> 01:10:49,048
LIAM: Correct. One last. It's small or it's
boring, it's business. I need a dagger. I don't

885
01:10:49,048 --> 01:10:53,992
want one for free or anything; I want to purchase
it, but we're a little low on funds. The reason

886
01:10:53,992 --> 01:10:57,617
Tiberius needs to go to Kraghammer is because
we're owed a large sum of money.

887
01:10:57,617 --> 01:11:01,388
MATT: "Right, you mentioned this last time,
when you almost opened a line of Gilmore's

888
01:11:01,388 --> 01:11:03,486
"Glorious Credit."

889
01:11:03,486 --> 01:11:05,697
LAURA: Mm-hm. I'm not there.

890
01:11:05,697 --> 01:11:08,923
LIAM: What would the credit entail?

891
01:11:08,923 --> 01:11:15,535
MATT: "Previously, we discussed 25,000 gold
pieces, the amount of which you were going to

892
01:11:15,535 --> 01:11:16,640
"retrieve."

893
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,389
LIAM: I was going to-- what was that?

894
01:11:18,389 --> 01:11:19,558
MATT: "Retrieve."

895
01:11:19,558 --> 01:11:23,774
LIAM: Retrieve? God, I've been in the Underdark so
long. What was the deal?

896
01:11:23,774 --> 01:11:31,633
MATT: "The deal was since you did not have funds,
and you had to retrieve this money from this

897
01:11:31,633 --> 01:11:39,956
"'Dwarf Town', as you so graciously put it, that
you would borrow the money, at the time, and then

898
01:11:39,956 --> 01:11:45,135
"pay me back within a month. Within a month."

899
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,934
LIAM: Understood.

900
01:11:46,934 --> 01:11:50,240
MARISHA: Wait, is Gilmore trying to say we owe him
money?

901
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:55,922
LIAM: No. We almost did that. Correct, DM? That's
what we almost did, but we didn't do it. You

902
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:56,970
offered it.

903
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:00,592
MATT: Correct. You backed out last minute when you
realized there was, apparently, hidden platinum--

904
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:07,414
LIAM: I would be interested-- Gilmore? I really
just need a quick favor, and I mean to pay you

905
01:12:07,414 --> 01:12:14,583
back quickly. I need a dagger for something. Not
your best dagger. Not your shittiest dagger,

906
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:24,531
either. I just need something nice. How much would
a fine dagger cost? Something that would be good

907
01:12:24,531 --> 01:12:29,500
in a fight. And could I pay you back in a couple
of days, once Tiberius returns from Kraghammer?

908
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:33,059
MATT: "If you want something functional, there are
masterwork daggers out there. We do have

909
01:12:33,059 --> 01:12:38,489
"base-level enchantments that give you a fine,
honed edge and a balance that cannot be beaten for

910
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:45,579
"its price range. For that, I can easily give you
one of our base-level enchanted items for no more

911
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:50,046
"than, friend discount included, 400 gold pieces."

912
01:12:50,046 --> 01:12:51,934
TALIESIN: That's a pretty good deal.

913
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,936
LIAM: Can I please purchase three of those?

914
01:12:55,936 --> 01:12:57,395
MATT: "You may!"

915
01:12:57,395 --> 01:13:00,461
LIAM: Done.

916
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:06,528
MATT: "All right! I'll get these right now!" He
stands up, and now that there's some sort of

917
01:13:06,528 --> 01:13:10,524
business involved, he's completely renovated and
recharged. He comes through the beaded curtain

918
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:17,258
again. You guys see Gilmore burst out, like,
(laughs) "We're in business!" And he goes into the

919
01:13:17,258 --> 01:13:22,813
next room, and back up the stairs, and takes a few
moments. He comes back down with an armful of

920
01:13:22,813 --> 01:13:26,389
these daggers, and sets them down on the counter.
"Three for you!

921
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:30,866
"That'll be 1,200 gold pieces, please."

922
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:37,499
LIAM: I reach out and I give his cheek a little
bubby-squeeze, and I clap him on the cheek, and

923
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:44,639
say, I'm good on my word, and you're a good
friend. Thank you, Gilmore.

924
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:52,043
MATT: "The least I could do. Pay me back. I'll
find you."

925
01:13:52,043 --> 01:13:55,296
LIAM: I know you're good on your word.

926
01:13:55,296 --> 01:13:56,706
MATT: "Indeed."

927
01:13:56,706 --> 01:14:00,885
LIAM: Keyleth? Scanlan?

928
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:06,008
SAM: Oh, yes! How'd it go in there? You're walking
straight, so it couldn't have gone too well.

929
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,665
LIAM: Very good. Warm in here.

930
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:14,221
TALIESIN: That dagger's so sharp, it could cut the
sexual tension.

931
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:15,884
ORION: Those are masterwork daggers?

932
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,961
MATT: They are plus-one enchanted daggers, yes.

933
01:14:18,961 --> 01:14:22,167
SAM: Well, let's get out of here and go. Did you
find us any--?

934
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:26,369
LIAM: I'm good. No, everything's good here. Just
not everywhere else.

935
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:28,385
SAM: Let's get out of here, go back to the keep.

936
01:14:28,385 --> 01:14:34,268
MATT: At this point, now, Tiberius, you have
coasted over the air, and as you come careening

937
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:41,424
in, you hear (swishing sounds) and look down. Two
crossbow bolts whiz past you.

938
01:14:41,424 --> 01:14:43,039
ORION: It's me, you idiots!

939
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:49,552
MATT: At which you hear immediately, "Oh, sorry!"
"Sorry! We're not used to having you bolt in from

940
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:51,077
"the skyline."

941
01:14:51,077 --> 01:14:52,977
ORION: I'm in a hurry, sorry! (whoosh)

942
01:14:52,977 --> 01:14:58,229
MATT: As you sweep past Shayne and Cordell, they
both change their bolts, and they're both arguing

943
01:14:58,229 --> 01:15:03,212
with each other, like, "You should've seen it was
him!" "Sorry." "Sorry, again!" You make your way

944
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:06,269
into the courtyard, inside Greyskull Keep.

945
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:08,278
TRAVIS: Why'd you miss?

946
01:15:08,278 --> 01:15:17,104
ORION: I go into, I rush in to find him eating.
(stammers) Quickly, quickly! And I go into the Bag

947
01:15:17,104 --> 01:15:20,996
of Holding and I take the item out that we need.
What was it?

948
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:22,504
TRAVIS: Well, we have a bunch of stuff.

949
01:15:22,504 --> 01:15:24,416
MATT: You're not with him, there.

950
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:31,648
LAURA: I walk into the room to see Tiberius
throwing things out of the

951
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:33,525
Bag of Holding, I'm assuming.

952
01:15:33,525 --> 01:15:37,667
ORION: I can't, because I have to visualize what
it is to pull it out.

953
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,432
TRAVIS: Yeah, what are you looking for?

954
01:15:39,432 --> 01:15:46,692
LIAM: I'm using my earring on the walk home. Does
it work? I don't know what the range is. Tiberius,

955
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:48,303
can you hear me? Tibs?

956
01:15:48,303 --> 01:15:53,439
MATT: You're pretty out of range at this point.

957
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:55,700
TRAVIS: What are you looking for, Tiberius?

958
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:01,480
ORION: I've taken my hand out. When we were in the
Underdark and one of the items that we procured

959
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,978
while we were scavenging, and we looted it, and we
could give it back to the Thunderbrand.

960
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:07,679
TRAVIS: Oh! Pieces of the enemy? We get paid for
it.

961
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,448
LAURA: But there were artifacts that they wanted.
I remember.

962
01:16:11,448 --> 01:16:12,931
MARISHA: They wanted a necklace, right?

963
01:16:12,931 --> 01:16:14,344
ORION: Yes. And we found one or two of them.

964
01:16:14,344 --> 01:16:19,302
MARISHA: Found a necklace, who was supposed to
go-- hang on, I'm finding it, I'm looking.

965
01:16:19,302 --> 01:16:22,688
TRAVIS: I've got two gold necklaces, two gold
chalices, and two rubies.

966
01:16:22,688 --> 01:16:26,432
MATT: It was actually a magical item, one that you
may have equipped. It'll say in the description of

967
01:16:26,432 --> 01:16:29,571
the item that it has an inscription on the back.

968
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:33,061
ORION: I don't have it.

969
01:16:33,061 --> 01:16:34,715
TRAVIS: I don't have that shit.

970
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,413
SAM: Whoa, what? It was a necklace we're talking
about?

971
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:41,166
MATT: Protection of some kind, if I recall.
Amulet.

972
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:45,841
LAURA: Oh, I don't have that. (gasps) Oh no! What
if we gave it to Kima?

973
01:16:45,841 --> 01:16:47,460
ORION: We didn't give it to them.

974
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:49,569
LAURA: But Kima took some armor we found!

975
01:16:49,569 --> 01:16:51,167
SAM: "Amulet of Natural Armor?"

976
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:54,732
MATT: Look in the description of the item. It
should say underneath the name. It'll have the

977
01:16:54,732 --> 01:16:58,022
actual inscription written in the descriptor of
the item.

978
01:16:58,022 --> 01:17:05,005
TRAVIS: Everybody look at your stuff. I look
inside my Belt of Dwarvenkind, and it says

979
01:17:05,005 --> 01:17:06,431
"Badass."

980
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:10,533
MARISHA: It's a sapphire pendant that should say,
"To Lorna, my love."

981
01:17:10,533 --> 01:17:11,737
LAURA: (gasps) Oh!

982
01:17:11,737 --> 01:17:21,718
ORION: That's what I reach in and grab. There you
go! Keyleth. I mean, your highness.

983
01:17:21,718 --> 01:17:23,669
I like your hair.

984
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:24,740
MARISHA: Thank you!

985
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:25,996
ORION: It looks cool.

986
01:17:25,996 --> 01:17:27,042
MARISHA: Thanks!

987
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,358
MATT: It is enchanted.

988
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:32,823
MARISHA: It's not the one you're wearing, right,
Scanlan?

989
01:17:32,823 --> 01:17:36,438
LAURA: No, I remember we found it and nobody
equipped it.

990
01:17:36,438 --> 01:17:39,510
TRAVIS: I had it in the bag, yeah.

991
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:48,149
ORION: I take it out, and I put it in mine. Grog,
I'm finding out a way, as soon as I can show this

992
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:54,861
to you, fellow. I'm going to go into Kraghammer
very, very fast as opposed to slowly, and it is,

993
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:57,756
so we should leave right now.

994
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,030
LAURA: Can I go with you?

995
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:01,575
ORION: Yeah, and I'll cast-- because, who was
around, just them two?

996
01:18:01,575 --> 01:18:02,624
MATT: Just those two.

997
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:06,723
ORION: I cast Fly again at 3rd or 4th level, to
cast on them.

998
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:08,146
TRAVIS: I don't want to go!

999
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:10,617
MATT: Now, all of a sudden, you're (whoosh) lifted
up in the air.

1000
01:18:10,617 --> 01:18:14,175
ORION: Yes, but we get there much faster if we fly.
And I go.

1001
01:18:14,175 --> 01:18:15,664
LAURA: And I take off after him!

1002
01:18:15,664 --> 01:18:17,206
TRAVIS: What if I want to stay?

1003
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:19,041
ORION: You can stay.

1004
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:25,560
TRAVIS: But I'm fucking floating above my meal!
No! This is bullshit. And I'm bouncing off the

1005
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,654
ceiling and shit. Can I control myself?

1006
01:18:28,654 --> 01:18:30,542
MATT: You can. It takes a moment to adjust to it.

1007
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:35,897
TRAVIS: I just start trying to swim down to my
plate.

1008
01:18:35,897 --> 01:18:38,118
MATT: It takes you a little bit, but you do
eventually get control of it.

1009
01:18:38,118 --> 01:18:44,997
TRAVIS: (eating noises) This isn't so bad.
(farting noise)

1010
01:18:44,997 --> 01:18:46,343
MATT: Propulsion does work.

1011
01:18:46,343 --> 01:18:50,307
LAURA: As we're flying, can I keep an eye out for
our party members that are returning?

1012
01:18:50,307 --> 01:18:54,520
MATT: Yep. And as you guys coast over, you see,
leaving the exterior wall gate to the south side

1013
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,487
of Emon, you see the rest of your party walking
back towards the keep.

1014
01:18:58,487 --> 01:19:00,470
LAURA: That means we're close enough. Brother!

1015
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,864
LIAM: Hello?

1016
01:19:01,864 --> 01:19:07,190
LAURA: We're heading to the portal, Tiberius is
working on something. We can get there faster!

1017
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:08,676
I'll be back soon.

1018
01:19:08,676 --> 01:19:12,697
LIAM: Oh, all right. Gilmore has an in: he said we
just need to mention his name and we're through.

1019
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:14,132
We can send Tiberius through.

1020
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:15,235
LAURA: Brilliant!

1021
01:19:15,235 --> 01:19:23,802
ORION: Ooh, that gives me a wonderful idea! And
then, I'll cast it at 4th level again, and I'll go

1022
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:26,015
(pew-pew!) and cast it on--

1023
01:19:26,015 --> 01:19:28,922
MARISHA: Just because I think it's funny-- Grog is
flying over too, right?

1024
01:19:28,922 --> 01:19:31,499
TRAVIS: I'm in that kitchen, floating around,
farting and eating food.

1025
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:37,832
Look, I've got priorities.

1026
01:19:37,832 --> 01:19:40,599
MARISHA: Okay, well, I see you guys are flying?
The two of you?

1027
01:19:40,599 --> 01:19:42,945
MATT: So you fly down and cast Fly on the rest of
them?

1028
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,692
ORION: Right. Come on, follow me!

1029
01:19:44,692 --> 01:19:48,770
LIAM: Holy shit, I've never flown before! This is
amazing!

1030
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:50,263
SAM: I'm flying, too? What's happening?

1031
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:54,865
MATT: You guys are now floating. You guys are
floating, as well. You're coasting over Emon for

1032
01:19:54,865 --> 01:20:08,488
roughly 12 or so seconds before Grog, you drop to
the ground, and now Tiberius and Vex,

1033
01:20:08,488 --> 01:20:09,988
you begin to plummet.

1034
01:20:09,988 --> 01:20:11,330
LAURA: Why are we plummeting?

1035
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:15,518
MATT: Fly is a concentration spell. You cast it
again. Your amulet keeps it up for two rounds,

1036
01:20:15,518 --> 01:20:19,043
which is 12 seconds, and then the previous Fly
spell deteriorates.

1037
01:20:19,043 --> 01:20:20,744
ORION: What about my circlet?

1038
01:20:20,744 --> 01:20:24,503
MATT: That's what I'm saying. The circlet lets you
maintain concentration for two additional rounds.

1039
01:20:24,503 --> 01:20:28,499
LAURA: Oh, okay! Tiberius, I'm falling!

1040
01:20:28,499 --> 01:20:36,412
ORION: I cast Fly again at 6th-level on everybody
else.

1041
01:20:36,412 --> 01:20:37,967
SAM: I start falling.

1042
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:40,058
ORION: No, because I can catch everybody.

1043
01:20:40,058 --> 01:20:43,398
MATT: At that point, now all of you guys are
flying.

1044
01:20:43,398 --> 01:20:47,799
ORION: You fall in the kitchen, though.

1045
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:50,992
TRAVIS: Well, that makes sense.

1046
01:20:50,992 --> 01:20:53,642
LIAM: Is this going to stick, Tiberius?

1047
01:20:53,642 --> 01:20:58,771
ORION: Yes. It's the same spell. I just really
need a nap after this. I really need a nap after

1048
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:04,900
this. I go back to gather them all.

1049
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:12,787
MATT: You make your way. Now, all of you following
Tiberius, you coast down to the Alabaster Lyceum,

1050
01:21:12,787 --> 01:21:18,988
landing right through the front area (whoosh),
this whole party appears. Catch your feet, and

1051
01:21:18,988 --> 01:21:23,769
there you see the same clerk looking up. "Ah, I
see you've returned."

1052
01:21:23,769 --> 01:21:29,101
ORION: Yes. Can we not talk to the middle guy
first? Can we go right to the last guy?

1053
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:31,403
MATT: "Down that hallway. Follow it to the very
end."

1054
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:33,045
ORION: Thank you very much.

1055
01:21:33,045 --> 01:21:34,257
MATT: "You're welcome."

1056
01:21:34,257 --> 01:21:36,437
ORION: Follow me, everybody!

1057
01:21:36,437 --> 01:21:42,200
MATT: You all glide through the hallway, or walk,
if you prefer. The end of the hallway, you open

1058
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,789
once again into the office, and there you see
behind his desk once again, the headmaster

1059
01:21:47,789 --> 01:21:53,952
Thurmond, who looks around. "Oh, yes. You've
returned. I received the note from your friend

1060
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:58,544
"Gilmore, and you're welcome to utilize one of our
sigils."

1061
01:21:58,544 --> 01:22:01,227
ORION: Wonderful. That makes me quite happy.

1062
01:22:01,227 --> 01:22:02,786
MATT: "To Kraghammer, was it?"

1063
01:22:02,786 --> 01:22:08,993
ORION: Yes, but I do not want to use that favor
for that sigil. I would like to call our friends,

1064
01:22:08,993 --> 01:22:14,927
and I brought the item. I bring out the amulet. I
want to show our friends in Kraghammer that we

1065
01:22:14,927 --> 01:22:20,285
actually brought them the thing to get their
permission to go on their sigil, and the other

1066
01:22:20,285 --> 01:22:22,551
continent that we were on is called what?

1067
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:24,374
LAURA: Vasselheim?

1068
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:31,787
ORION: Yes. The favor I would like for Gilmore is
to get the Vasselheim sigil, please. But let's

1069
01:22:31,787 --> 01:22:33,841
contact our friends at Kraghammer first.

1070
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:42,186
MATT: "Two notes. There is no sigil in Vasselheim.
They have been outlawed and destroyed to prevent

1071
01:22:42,186 --> 01:22:50,490
"arcane intrusion or subterfuge. There have been,
historically, many a war's passed in which

1072
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:56,928
"Vasselheim nearly fell to the sudden appearance
of small armies within its walls, and as such,

1073
01:22:57,094 --> 01:23:02,764
"many of these sigils, all of them have been
destroyed over the past 1,000 years. However, it

1074
01:23:02,764 --> 01:23:07,329
"was the third war--" And he's going into a long
diatribe about the history of Vasselheim.

1075
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:17,238
LAURA: You are so educated. Perhaps we could talk
later about all of this wonderful history.

1076
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:22,890
MATT: "Certainly. Yes, I'm sorry. The mirror." He
pulls up the mirror, pulls out his chest, brings

1077
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:32,299
out the same marble again, pops it into the
mirror. It shimmers. "Hello? Hello?" You hear

1078
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:41,370
another voice say, "Oh, are you kidding me?
Really? You again? All right, what are you

1079
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,659
"bothering me with?"

1080
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:48,752
ORION: Using my Mage Hand, I'm like, it's one of
the things that you wanted us to get.

1081
01:23:48,752 --> 01:23:50,150
LAURA: Who are you talking to?

1082
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,857
ORION: I can see it. It's fine.

1083
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:55,650
MATT: "What's it say? I can't read it from here.
Read it out for me."

1084
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:57,743
ORION: What does it say, Keyleth?

1085
01:23:57,743 --> 01:24:01,025
MARISHA: To Lorna, with love. It's written right
there, Tiberius.

1086
01:24:01,025 --> 01:24:06,302
ORION: Oh, sorry. To Lorna, with love.

1087
01:24:06,302 --> 01:24:13,172
MATT: At which point, you see the eyes of this
dwarf that were very untrusting open wide for a

1088
01:24:13,172 --> 01:24:23,099
second. "All right. Give him the sigil. Send him
through. I'll see you soon."

1089
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:25,488
The mirror gives out again.

1090
01:24:25,488 --> 01:24:27,197
LAURA: Oh, all of us?

1091
01:24:27,197 --> 01:24:33,419
MATT: No, the headmaster takes the mirror and puts
it down. He points back to the clerk who's in the

1092
01:24:33,419 --> 01:24:38,489
hallway behind you again, waiting, and says, "Go
ahead and bring them to the Junction. Allow them

1093
01:24:38,489 --> 01:24:48,325
"access to the sigil for House Thunderbrand in
Kraghammer." He nods. "Of course."

1094
01:24:48,325 --> 01:24:53,172
ORION: As he's doing this, I'm writing the sigil
that I'm seeing forming in my--

1095
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:57,923
MATT: He leads you to the Junction, and there is
one of the doors he opens up on the inside, there

1096
01:24:57,923 --> 01:25:05,558
is the actual sigil to Kraghammer there. He gives
you some time to study it, you memorize it, you

1097
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:11,263
get it locked in, and you now permanently know the
sigil of teleportation to Kraghammer within the

1098
01:25:11,263 --> 01:25:13,109
House Thunderbrand.

1099
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:18,753
ORION: Shall we go collect our money now?

1100
01:25:18,753 --> 01:25:21,266
SAM and LAURA: Yes.

1101
01:25:21,266 --> 01:25:25,127
LIAM: We're all going? All of us?

1102
01:25:25,127 --> 01:25:30,584
MARISHA: Well, I guess just the five of us, cause
Grog and Percy are back at the Keep.

1103
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,710
SAM: Would you rather just send Tiberius, then?

1104
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:35,009
LAURA: No, we should go.

1105
01:25:35,009 --> 01:25:37,697
MARISHA: I can go back and check in on them.

1106
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:41,488
ORION: Everybody's here but Grog.

1107
01:25:41,488 --> 01:25:42,729
TALIESIN: And me.

1108
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:45,637
ORION: Wait, where are you? Oh, you're working.
Tinkering.

1109
01:25:45,637 --> 01:25:48,060
LIAM: I have an errand to run.

1110
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:52,976
MARISHA: You have an errand to run? All right,
I'll go with Vax--

1111
01:25:52,976 --> 01:25:59,734
LAURA: It's the three of us, me and you and--

1112
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:04,286
ORION: Okay. Thunderbrands are buttholes, though.

1113
01:26:04,286 --> 01:26:06,960
SAM: That's all right. That's why we're taking the
heaviest hitters.

1114
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:13,388
MARISHA: Wait. We'll address that later. Come on,
Vax.

1115
01:26:13,509 --> 01:26:15,100
LAURA: Persuasion-wise.

1116
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:20,020
MATT: So you guys head back to the Keep, you meet
up with Grog and Percy, what about you guys?

1117
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:26,010
What're you doing? For, Tiberius, Scanlan, and
Vex.

1118
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:27,373
LAURA: We go through.

1119
01:26:27,373 --> 01:26:29,677
MATT: Well, it's just the sigil. You have to cast
the spell.

1120
01:26:29,677 --> 01:26:30,738
LAURA and SAM: Oh.

1121
01:26:30,738 --> 01:26:34,089
ORION: Yeah. Is that what you want to do? Is that
what's going on?

1122
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:36,027
SAM: It's a spell?

1123
01:26:36,027 --> 01:26:50,030
ORION: Oh, shit. No, actually, I need to sleep.
All that flying left me a bit exhausted.

1124
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:52,072
LAURA: Oh my god.

1125
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:54,941
LIAM: Sorcerers, they improvise.

1126
01:26:54,941 --> 01:26:57,713
LAURA: Wait, you're saying that we cannot go
through?

1127
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:01,696
ORION: Well, hold on. Maybe there's a way I could
trigger the spell?

1128
01:27:01,696 --> 01:27:03,681
SAM: Let's go home and go to sleep.

1129
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:14,052
ORION: Let's get a drink, maybe? It's only been a
day.

1130
01:27:14,052 --> 01:27:17,216
MARISHA: You can cast that sigil anywhere, right?
You don't have to be here?

1131
01:27:17,216 --> 01:27:19,507
We could do it from home.

1132
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:21,597
LAURA: Then let's just fucking go home.

1133
01:27:21,597 --> 01:27:24,074
ORION: What time of the day is this? It's still
afternoonish, right?

1134
01:27:24,074 --> 01:27:26,512
MATT: At this point in time, with all the travel
back and forth, it's getting close to dusk.

1135
01:27:26,512 --> 01:27:27,771
ORION: Great.

1136
01:27:27,771 --> 01:27:32,002
MARISHA: We'll take a nap and we'll go tomorrow.
It's getting late, the Thunderbrands are probably

1137
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:34,811
going to bed at this point. We don't want to
invade.

1138
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:36,715
They're probably just sitting down for dinner.

1139
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:39,330
SAM: They live in the Underdark. There's no real
time there.

1140
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:44,347
ORION: My swallow's been crafted at the other
place, right? Has that happened already?

1141
01:27:44,347 --> 01:27:48,347
MATT: Yeah, it's been crafted for you, yeah. It's
not a swallow.

1142
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:50,185
It's a quarterstaff with knives attached.

1143
01:27:50,185 --> 01:27:58,024
ORION: I'm calling it swallow. On the way back,
because we're obviously going to leave in the

1144
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:05,851
morning, to do stuff. I'd like to quickly stop at
any blacksmith I see on the

1145
01:28:05,851 --> 01:28:08,043
way back to Greyskull Keep.

1146
01:28:08,043 --> 01:28:11,216
MATT: Okay. Yeah, there are a couple blacksmiths
that you know about on the way through.

1147
01:28:11,216 --> 01:28:16,685
ORION: Okay. I go to the good one, not the bad
one, per reputation.

1148
01:28:16,685 --> 01:28:20,018
MATT: Best reputation is Karin, but she's a
specialist. She's the one that made Trinket's--

1149
01:28:20,018 --> 01:28:21,236
LAURA: Yeah, Karin!

1150
01:28:21,236 --> 01:28:23,392
ORION: I'll go to her, because she's awesome.

1151
01:28:23,392 --> 01:28:26,751
MATT: All right. You go on and approach there.
She's currently working away on some custom piece

1152
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:30,758
that she's currently working on. She's like,
"Hello, can I help you, dragonborn?"

1153
01:28:30,758 --> 01:28:37,475
ORION: Yes, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia;
moreover, from Vox Machina--

1154
01:28:37,475 --> 01:28:39,011
MATT: "What can I help you with?"

1155
01:28:39,011 --> 01:28:44,226
ORION: Oh. Sorry, right. We've done business
before. I would like to commission you. And as

1156
01:28:44,226 --> 01:28:49,877
I'm doing this I'm taking out five of my daggers
that I have, and I'm going to hand them to her. I

1157
01:28:49,877 --> 01:28:58,223
would like to commission you to somehow craft
these daggers into a type of bended glaive, if you

1158
01:28:58,223 --> 01:29:01,095
would. I don't know how long it would take you to
do so.

1159
01:29:01,095 --> 01:29:03,011
MATT: "What?"

1160
01:29:03,011 --> 01:29:09,599
ORION: You see, it's like, it would look like
this, but it's--

1161
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:10,857
SAM: Krull?

1162
01:29:10,857 --> 01:29:21,308
ORION: Yeah, totally, but the blades are bended,
but they're all connected in the center. You could

1163
01:29:21,308 --> 01:29:25,260
use an iron, or a steel ingot to connect the--

1164
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,978
MATT: "I can certainly try, yeah, aye."

1165
01:29:26,978 --> 01:29:28,244
ORION: Wonderful!

1166
01:29:28,244 --> 01:29:36,894
MATT: "All right. It would take me about two days?
And you've already supplied the material, other

1167
01:29:36,894 --> 01:29:39,702
"than a bit of the side bits. I'll say I'll charge
you 100 gold pieces."

1168
01:29:39,702 --> 01:29:41,502
ORION: 100 gold pieces?

1169
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:42,663
MATT: "Aye, I'm a specialist!"

1170
01:29:42,663 --> 01:29:44,796
SAM: You went to the good one.

1171
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:50,769
ORION: What, that's all? I mean, oh yes, of
course. Here's 120.

1172
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:57,150
MATT: "Certainly. Thank you. All right, it should
be done within the next two days. You're free to

1173
01:29:57,150 --> 01:29:59,670
"come by and check on it if you like, but it'll be
done."

1174
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:02,578
ORION: I trust your work. Trinket's armor was
fantastic.

1175
01:30:02,578 --> 01:30:04,793
MATT: "Huh?"

1176
01:30:04,793 --> 01:30:07,340
ORION: Did she do that? I thought that was the
same character.

1177
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,118
LAURA: This is Karin.

1178
01:30:09,118 --> 01:30:13,186
SAM: She just thought bear. She just knows bear.

1179
01:30:13,186 --> 01:30:15,381
ORION: Bear's armor. The bear's armor was--

1180
01:30:15,381 --> 01:30:19,105
MATT: "Oh! You're friends with that one? She was
real nice. That bear was adorable.

1181
01:30:19,105 --> 01:30:20,543
"Happy to help with that one."

1182
01:30:20,543 --> 01:30:22,008
ORION: His name is Trinket.

1183
01:30:22,008 --> 01:30:23,357
MATT: "Oh, is that what it was?"

1184
01:30:23,357 --> 01:30:25,217
ORION: I'm surprised she didn't tell you. It's an
adorable name.

1185
01:30:25,217 --> 01:30:26,927
MATT: "Probably had. It's just been a while."

1186
01:30:26,927 --> 01:30:28,156
ORION: This is Lockheed.

1187
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:31,266
MATT: "Oh, you're so cute, Lockheed." You guys
talk for a little bit and

1188
01:30:31,266 --> 01:30:32,853
eventually make your way back.

1189
01:30:32,853 --> 01:30:35,776
ORION: I do business with her, and I go back to
the keep.

1190
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:41,228
SAM: Are we still waiting for him outside?

1191
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:42,503
MATT: Yeah, you guys are right outside.

1192
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:47,752
SAM: When he comes out, I cast Minor Illusion to
make it look like I have a long gray beard.

1193
01:30:47,752 --> 01:30:51,550
(laughter)

1194
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:54,333
SAM: Can we go home now, please, Tiberius?

1195
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:56,542
ORION: Yes. Sorry.

1196
01:30:56,542 --> 01:30:59,625
SAM: Any other stops you'd like to make? The
dry-cleaners, perhaps?

1197
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:02,013
ORION: Prestidigitation.

1198
01:31:02,013 --> 01:31:07,025
SAM: Oh, that's great. Now let's go night-night so
you can cast a spell on us.

1199
01:31:07,025 --> 01:31:10,106
MATT: All right, you guys head back to the keep.

1200
01:31:10,106 --> 01:31:12,106
LIAM: While they're doing that, I stealth away
from the group.

1201
01:31:12,106 --> 01:31:16,329
MARISHA: Can I do a passive perception check to
see if I notice him sneaking away?

1202
01:31:16,329 --> 01:31:20,854
ORION: I would like to fart. Natural 20!

1203
01:31:20,854 --> 01:31:23,400
SAM: It's a huge fart.

1204
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,570
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception.

1205
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:28,291
LIAM: I rolled a 32.

1206
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:29,568
MARISHA: Perception or passive perception?

1207
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:33,775
MATT: For this, because it's not active? It would
be your passive.

1208
01:31:33,775 --> 01:31:37,175
MARISHA: Then that is 24.

1209
01:31:37,175 --> 01:31:46,943
MATT: Vax has vanished. While you might have
noticed, instead the explosion-like eruption of

1210
01:31:46,943 --> 01:31:53,656
gas from your dragonborn friend distracted you and
gave him the proper getaway. You vanish.

1211
01:31:53,656 --> 01:31:59,228
LIAM: Yeah, I'm totally down an alleyway, through
the alley, onto another main thoroughfare. I grab

1212
01:31:59,228 --> 01:32:05,458
a random person on the street. Excuse me, I'm
looking for a specific butcher. Harold the

1213
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:09,240
butcher. Do you know? I think he's in the upper
slums. Can you point me toward him?

1214
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:15,346
MATT: The individual you stopped is a younger
gentleman, probably in his mid-20s or so, a bit

1215
01:32:15,346 --> 01:32:20,395
dirty in the face and coming from a day of work,
going to the local tavern to finish his eve with

1216
01:32:20,395 --> 01:32:27,358
some drinks. "I can't say I do. I mean, there are
butchers all over town. There's one--"

1217
01:32:27,358 --> 01:32:30,260
LIAM: Where's the upper slums? Upper slums,
please.

1218
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:34,051
MATT: "Oh, that would be north side of Emon. That
way." He points you towards the--

1219
01:32:34,051 --> 01:32:37,339
LIAM: I don't even say anything else. I just walk.
I don't know how long that will take me.

1220
01:32:37,339 --> 01:32:43,855
MATT: It will take you about, from where you are
right now, 30 minutes. All right, so you guys get

1221
01:32:43,855 --> 01:32:48,797
back to the keep. Grog has eaten his fill.

1222
01:32:48,797 --> 01:32:50,322
TRAVIS: I'm asleep on the table.

1223
01:32:50,322 --> 01:32:55,138
MATT: Yeah. Passed out. Percy's nowhere to be
seen. You, I would like for you to make a

1224
01:32:55,138 --> 01:33:01,274
tinkering roll in relation to the construction of
ammunition.

1225
01:33:01,274 --> 01:33:05,037
TALIESIN: Ten.

1226
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:16,588
MATT: Ten? You manage to, utilizing material for
20 bullets, only craft ten. But you get ten

1227
01:33:16,588 --> 01:33:19,636
bullets out of it, as opposed to wasting the
materials.

1228
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:29,882
ORION: Is it possible to, before I go to sleep, I
have a basic poison potion I've been hoarding.

1229
01:33:29,882 --> 01:33:34,746
Could I try to dip the tip of one of my bolts in
that?

1230
01:33:34,746 --> 01:33:41,645
MATT: You can certainly try. There's a difference
between poison and disease. They're different. The

1231
01:33:41,645 --> 01:33:43,509
potion seems to have no effect.

1232
01:33:43,509 --> 01:33:44,858
ORION: On bolts?

1233
01:33:44,858 --> 01:33:47,713
MATT: It doesn't have any effect.

1234
01:33:47,713 --> 01:33:50,606
TALIESIN: How many batches of bullets are you
going to let me attempt to make?

1235
01:33:50,606 --> 01:33:55,561
MATT: For the day, that's what you spent making.
Tomorrow, we'll get to whatever it is you want to

1236
01:33:55,561 --> 01:34:00,155
craft then. You go off and manage to make your way
to the upper slums.

1237
01:34:00,155 --> 01:34:05,480
LIAM: Yes. I see a stunted old woman and stop her
on the street and say, Grandmother. I'm looking

1238
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:11,154
for Harold the butcher. Do you know where I can
find him?

1239
01:34:11,154 --> 01:34:18,945
MATT: "Best I can gather, he'd be around that
way." She points you, and the breath is awful.

1240
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:23,958
She's missing teeth, but her crooked finger curves
off to the side, and you can see across the way,

1241
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:33,817
next to a homestead or hovel, there is a very
humble-looking butcher that is currently in the

1242
01:34:33,817 --> 01:34:34,939
process of closing shop.

1243
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:39,390
LIAM: I'd like to go stealth. I rolled a 20.

1244
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:46,051
MATT: All right. You make your way up there. You
can see there's an older gentleman in his mid-40s

1245
01:34:46,051 --> 01:34:49,915
or so, salt-and-pepper hair, black with a bit of
gray on the sides,

1246
01:34:49,915 --> 01:34:52,232
is currently in the process of closing up.

1247
01:34:52,414 --> 01:34:58,398
LIAM: Do I see Kynan anywhere? No? And it's a
home? It's a business and a home?

1248
01:34:58,497 --> 01:35:01,745
MATT: It's hard to tell. It looks like a business
from this perspective.

1249
01:35:01,872 --> 01:35:06,714
LIAM: Okay, I'd like to go around the back of the
building and scope it out.

1250
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:12,015
MATT: You look through the windows. There's a dull
light on the inside from what looks like a small

1251
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:17,334
hooded lantern set up for a bit of interior light,
but there's nobody else in the house.

1252
01:35:17,334 --> 01:35:22,902
LIAM: There's nobody in? I'd like to, at the
window, listen and use perception to see if I can

1253
01:35:22,902 --> 01:35:24,638
tell if anyone's inside.

1254
01:35:24,638 --> 01:35:27,329
MATT: You listen for a while. Make a perception
roll.

1255
01:35:27,329 --> 01:35:33,225
LIAM: Yeah, that's 25.

1256
01:35:33,225 --> 01:35:39,902
MATT: All right. As you continue to listen,
eventually you hear the slamming of wood. You look

1257
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:43,676
off, and through the bit of the glass window--
you're peeking from the side-- you see the same

1258
01:35:43,676 --> 01:35:49,294
gentleman who was closing the shop enter the room
where the hooded lantern is. There's a table. He

1259
01:35:49,294 --> 01:35:54,492
sits down quietly for a second, looks at the lamp,
starts cleaning his fingernails a little bit,

1260
01:35:54,492 --> 01:35:59,311
gives a big sigh, and turns off the light of the
lantern and exits the room,

1261
01:35:59,311 --> 01:36:00,763
closing the door behind him.

1262
01:36:00,763 --> 01:36:02,294
LIAM: Is it one floor, the building?

1263
01:36:02,294 --> 01:36:03,233
MATT: It's one floor.

1264
01:36:03,233 --> 01:36:05,642
LIAM: It's one floor. Is the window locked?

1265
01:36:05,642 --> 01:36:09,448
MATT: You checked the window. It's not locked.

1266
01:36:09,448 --> 01:36:10,829
LIAM: All right, I'm climbing in.

1267
01:36:10,829 --> 01:36:13,939
MATT: You slip in without a problem. You've done
this many times before.

1268
01:36:13,939 --> 01:36:20,292
LIAM: It's a family residence where Kynan lives.
Are there bedrooms?

1269
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:26,163
MATT: It's hard to tell, looking around the room
here. There are three doors that exit. One that he

1270
01:36:26,163 --> 01:36:29,665
came through, which is apparently from the front
of the butcher shop. This appears to be a central

1271
01:36:29,665 --> 01:36:32,918
room that connects to wherever else he walked.
There are two other doors.

1272
01:36:32,918 --> 01:36:37,769
LIAM: They're not trapped, are they?

1273
01:36:37,769 --> 01:36:41,008
MATT: They're not trapped.

1274
01:36:41,008 --> 01:36:45,734
LIAM: So I'm going to crouch down and push open
the first door. What do I see?

1275
01:36:45,734 --> 01:36:49,064
MATT: The door immediately right or the door in
front of you? The door in front of you is the one

1276
01:36:49,064 --> 01:36:50,270
that the man traveled through.

1277
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,371
LIAM: Oh, no. Not that one. There were two other
doors, weren't there?

1278
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:56,021
MATT: There's the door that he came in from when
he sat down, and then he left through the door

1279
01:36:56,021 --> 01:36:58,187
across the way from you, and there is a door that
been unopened.

1280
01:36:58,187 --> 01:36:59,814
LIAM: There's one other door? That's the one.

1281
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:04,693
MATT: Okay. You push open the door very quietly.
It makes a little creaking sound, but you stop.

1282
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:11,858
Peering inside, it's dark. There appears to be a
bed. There's a small table. There's what looks

1283
01:37:11,858 --> 01:37:17,766
like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the
side. It looks

1284
01:37:17,766 --> 01:37:20,203
like a bedroom that nobody's currently in.

1285
01:37:20,203 --> 01:37:28,207
LIAM: And there's no sign that this is a youth's
bedroom or father's bedroom? What can I glean from

1286
01:37:28,207 --> 01:37:29,672
what I see in here?

1287
01:37:29,672 --> 01:37:32,102
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1288
01:37:32,102 --> 01:37:38,004
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 22.

1289
01:37:38,004 --> 01:37:42,781
MATT: Okay. You take a little bit of time in
peering over the materials, looking at the bed

1290
01:37:42,781 --> 01:37:48,049
size, looking at the boot size, looking at
whatever you can nearby. This bed is definitely

1291
01:37:48,049 --> 01:37:54,228
weathered. It's been used for a long time. There
are a couple of small knick-knacks and toys that

1292
01:37:54,228 --> 01:37:56,776
are discarded underneath that have been there for
a while that lead you to believe that this was at

1293
01:37:56,776 --> 01:38:02,572
one point a boy's room. However, what you do
notice is that most of the materials, most of the

1294
01:38:02,572 --> 01:38:06,528
belongings, anything that you would normally see
in a boy's room, anything that would say that a

1295
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:10,919
person lives here seem to have been hastily
grabbed and taken off.

1296
01:38:10,919 --> 01:38:23,249
LIAM: And the father went out the other way? All
right, so I creep back out the window and I go out

1297
01:38:23,249 --> 01:38:26,349
the front and I knock really loud on the front
door.

1298
01:38:26,349 --> 01:38:31,842
MATT: A couple moments later, a voice comes from
the other side. "Hello?"

1299
01:38:31,842 --> 01:38:35,919
LIAM: Hello. I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother
you. I know you've closed up shop.

1300
01:38:35,919 --> 01:38:39,601
MATT: "I'm done for business for the day. Come
back tomorrow."

1301
01:38:39,601 --> 01:38:46,236
LIAM: I'm actually not looking to buy anything. I
owe your son a bit of money. I lost some money in

1302
01:38:46,236 --> 01:38:53,780
a wager we made on a dog fight, and I was hoping
to reimburse him. Do you know where he is?

1303
01:38:53,780 --> 01:39:01,333
MATT: The door opens a little bit, and an eye
peeks through. You gather there's a slight scent

1304
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:05,694
of alcohol from the other side as he starts
talking. He says, "I don't know where my son's

1305
01:39:05,694 --> 01:39:09,905
"gone off to. He came in in a huff. We got in an
argument. He grabbed his stuff and left. He does

1306
01:39:09,905 --> 01:39:11,558
"this every now and then. He'll be back."

1307
01:39:11,558 --> 01:39:13,718
LIAM: You think he'll be back?

1308
01:39:13,718 --> 01:39:16,799
MATT: "This isn't the first time he's done this."

1309
01:39:16,799 --> 01:39:21,986
LIAM: I want to leave something with you.

1310
01:39:21,986 --> 01:39:24,670
MATT: "You said it was money you owed him?"

1311
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:27,502
LIAM: Yes.

1312
01:39:27,502 --> 01:39:30,166
MATT: "I can give that to him."

1313
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:44,199
LIAM: I take 50 gold of what I have left and I
leave it with him, and I take out three daggers. I

1314
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:49,071
can hear my sister's voice in the back of my head.
I want to use insight on him to make sure he's

1315
01:39:49,071 --> 01:39:53,522
trustworthy. Oh, that's good. That's 20.

1316
01:39:53,522 --> 01:40:01,422
MATT: Okay. There's something about his face that
gives you the feeling that he's more interested in

1317
01:40:01,422 --> 01:40:05,611
the contents of what you're leaving than actually
transferring these to the intended recipient.

1318
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:09,534
LIAM: Just give him the 50 gold. Thank you. And I
leave.

1319
01:40:09,534 --> 01:40:14,612
MATT: Okay. Closes the door behind you, you hear a
lock. Light goes back out in the room.

1320
01:40:14,612 --> 01:40:20,692
SAM: Go in there and kill him. Kill him, shit on
his bed, and leave.

1321
01:40:20,692 --> 01:40:22,223
LIAM: I head back to the keep.

1322
01:40:22,223 --> 01:40:27,863
MATT: Okay. All right, eventually Vax finds his
way back to the keep. The rest of you are there,

1323
01:40:27,863 --> 01:40:30,584
at rest for the evening. Is there anything else
you want to accomplish before the night's out?

1324
01:40:30,584 --> 01:40:33,742
MARISHA: I just flipped through my book on the
alchemy section for a bit.

1325
01:40:33,742 --> 01:40:38,732
MATT: All right. You all find yourself to bed for
the evening, rest up for the next morning, and at

1326
01:40:38,732 --> 01:40:41,793
that point we're going to go ahead and take our
break. Five minutes, guys, a strict five minutes

1327
01:40:41,793 --> 01:40:45,490
because we still have a lot to get through. A lot
to get through tonight, don't want to stay late.

1328
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:47,050
LIAM: Another nine hours.

1329
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:52,506
MATT: No. See you guys in about five minutes,
quick restroom break. We'll be right back.

1330
01:40:52,506 --> 01:55:12,918
[break]

1331
01:55:12,918 --> 01:55:19,596
MATT: Welcome back, from our very strict, very
strict five-minute break. We're very good at that.

1332
01:55:19,596 --> 01:55:26,194
Yeah. That's right. Couple quick things. First
off, we just hit 7,500 subscribers!

1333
01:55:26,194 --> 01:55:29,008

01:55:29,008 --> 01:55:33,610
MATT: That's amazing for many reasons. But all of
you who are currently watching, be active in the

1335
01:55:33,610 --> 01:55:37,239

1338
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:46,766
TALIESIN: Maybe signed by Kit.

1339
01:55:46,766 --> 01:55:50,564
SAM: She's amazing.

1340
01:55:50,564 --> 01:55:54,959
MATT: Yeah. So please be active in the chatroom,
be part of that giveaway when it gets put out, and

1341
01:55:54,959 --> 01:55:58,218
thank you guys so much for being so amazing and
getting us to that point that's--

1342
01:55:58,218 --> 01:56:02,224
LIAM: Yeah! You 7,500 people, fucking thank you,
man. Thank you.

1343
01:56:02,224 --> 01:56:05,700
TRAVIS: But only you 7,500. The rest can fuck
off.

1344
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:17,226
MATT: That was in character. All right, cool.
Let's get back and see if we can, see if we can

1345
01:56:17,226 --> 01:56:25,388
roll through some of this stuff. As you wake the
next morning, you guys awaken to the dull sound of

1346
01:56:25,388 --> 01:56:31,499
metal clanging as Percy has already been the first
to wake and is back in the workshop. Tiberius,

1347
01:56:31,499 --> 01:56:36,169
you're well-rested. Everyone's spells have
returned. You get to make a beard roll.

1348
01:56:36,169 --> 01:56:41,657
TRAVIS: Beard check, please! Three. Five.

1349
01:56:41,657 --> 01:56:47,728
MATT: 35? What? Bundlesofkittens, by the way, won.
Congratulations to bundlesofkittens.

1350
01:56:47,728 --> 01:56:52,337
Going to get prizes.

1351
01:56:52,337 --> 01:56:54,461
LAURA: Adorable.

1352
01:56:54,461 --> 01:57:00,872
MATT: 35% does count. As you wake up, you reach up
and feel the return of a nice hefty bit of scruff

1353
01:57:00,872 --> 01:57:07,390
to your chin. Yeah, it's getting pretty thick now.
It's a good, like, half an inch to an inch length.

1354
01:57:07,390 --> 01:57:14,170
And you're starting to get a little, you notice
the first time you grew some facial hair it was

1355
01:57:14,170 --> 01:57:18,384
coming through that weird, creepy translucent
color? It's starting to come through with a

1356
01:57:18,384 --> 01:57:24,911
proper, almost a dark red-brown color to it.

1357
01:57:24,911 --> 01:57:26,008
TRAVIS: What?

1358
01:57:26,008 --> 01:57:28,091
MARISHA: Got a little bit of the Irish thing going
on.

1359
01:57:28,091 --> 01:57:31,941
TRAVIS: I don't know, I might have to get a cage;
the women are going to come running.

1360
01:57:31,941 --> 01:57:39,259
MATT: So as you all gather for breakfast, you get
your fill, a fine breakfast awaits you, already

1361
01:57:39,259 --> 01:57:43,664
prepared by your servants of the Greyskull Keep.
What do you wish to do?

1362
01:57:43,664 --> 01:57:49,552
TRAVIS: Good morning, Vox Machina. Lovely to see
all of you.

1363
01:57:49,552 --> 01:57:54,519
MARISHA: So Grog, you fell asleep in your plate of
food and woke up with a beard.

1364
01:57:54,519 --> 01:57:56,739
TRAVIS: I know. Some guys are just lucky.

1365
01:57:56,739 --> 01:57:59,278
(laughter)

1366
01:57:59,278 --> 01:58:01,222
TALIESIN: Have we checked to make sure it's not a
stain?

1367
01:58:01,222 --> 01:58:04,767
TRAVIS: Hey, fuck off with your stinging, burning
shit, all right? I'm not putting anything else in

1368
01:58:04,767 --> 01:58:11,327
water. I don't know if you know, Scanlan, but
water burns.

1369
01:58:11,327 --> 01:58:14,876
LAURA: Good job, Percy, now he's never going to
bathe.

1370
01:58:14,876 --> 01:58:17,722
TALIESIN: You may have taken the wrong lesson away
from that.

1371
01:58:17,722 --> 01:58:22,105
TRAVIS: No, I pretty much got it. In, burn, ouch,
powder.

1372
01:58:22,105 --> 01:58:30,025
ORION: You're not a chinchilla, Grog, which is a
small creature that bathes itself in dust. But you

1373
01:58:30,025 --> 01:58:33,115
are a human, which water is good.

1374
01:58:33,115 --> 01:58:34,402
TRAVIS: I'm not a human.

1375
01:58:34,402 --> 01:58:41,434
ORION: Well, you are a humanoid. Which is, water
is good. Which, most of you is water.

1376
01:58:41,434 --> 01:58:44,661
TRAVIS: (gasps) You always drink water when we
drink. Does it burn?

1377
01:58:44,661 --> 01:58:46,614
ORION: No, it feels rather--

1378
01:58:46,614 --> 01:58:47,822
SAM: Let's get going.

1379
01:58:47,822 --> 01:58:49,455
TALIESIN: He does breathe fire.

1380
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:52,362
ORION: I'm feeding Lockheed some of my breakfast.

1381
01:58:52,362 --> 01:58:59,721
MATT: Certainly. Lockheed enjoys the breakfast.
Lockheed is looking healthier. The color is a

1382
01:58:59,721 --> 01:59:03,803
little more of a deep emerald green, and he
appears to have

1383
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:05,565
a little more energy this morning.

1384
01:59:05,565 --> 01:59:11,089
SAM: Does it shit on your shoulder?

1385
01:59:11,089 --> 01:59:21,638
MATT: He hasn't noticed, but there is a slight
streak of dried pseudo-dragon poo. You're not

1386
01:59:21,638 --> 01:59:23,354
aware of it to cast that yet.

1387
01:59:23,354 --> 01:59:26,174
TALIESIN: Methinks the DM doth speak from
experience.

1388
01:59:26,174 --> 01:59:29,268
MATT: As a bird owner, he does.

1389
01:59:29,268 --> 01:59:34,989
ORION: I'm going to, I rolled, I'm going to do a
roll for the day, I think I rolled one for the

1390
01:59:34,989 --> 01:59:41,687
day, and I'm going to go: Staht. Staht. And I'm
going to,

1391
01:59:41,687 --> 01:59:44,660
I rolled a 14 to try to teach it to sit. Staht.

1392
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:50,575
MATT: (lizard noises) It sits down on the edge of
the table.

1393
01:59:50,575 --> 02:00:00,722
ORION: And I give it a treat. Krar, Krar, there
you go.

1394
02:00:00,722 --> 02:00:02,435
MATT: Bites your finger.

1395
02:00:02,435 --> 02:00:04,488
ORION: As it's hanging, I put it on my shoulder.

1396
02:00:04,488 --> 02:00:06,613
MATT: (lizard noises) It sits there.

1397
02:00:06,613 --> 02:00:09,715
MARISHA: They get nippy. It's in the breed.

1398
02:00:09,715 --> 02:00:11,798
MATT: So! What do you want to do?

1399
02:00:11,798 --> 02:00:16,553
SAM: We want to get out of here. Cast the thing.
Let's go.

1400
02:00:16,768 --> 02:00:22,011
ORION: As I'm having my oatmeal and such, I start
to cast.

1401
02:00:22,011 --> 02:00:28,202
MARISHA: I still think maybe the more talkative
members of the group should go?

1402
02:00:28,202 --> 02:00:30,404
SAM: Still want to split the party?

1403
02:00:30,404 --> 02:00:33,105
TALIESIN: I'm staying home, anyway

1404
02:00:33,105 --> 02:00:35,731
MARISHA: I'm checking in with Tiberius-- oh sorry,
Percy.

1405
02:00:35,731 --> 02:00:40,025
MATT: At which point the teleportation sigil
appears in the center of the floor the way

1406
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:42,125
Tiberius had prepared it. It's glowing right now.

1407
02:00:42,125 --> 02:00:44,338
TRAVIS: I've got the creature bits so I should go,
too.

1408
02:00:44,338 --> 02:00:46,929
LAURA: You! Take care of my bear, I'm leaving him
here with you.

1409
02:00:46,929 --> 02:00:48,269
LIAM: All right. I got him.

1410
02:00:48,269 --> 02:00:51,524
LAURA: Oh, Trinket! I love you so.

1411
02:00:51,524 --> 02:00:53,875
MATT: Trinket comes up and like rubs his nose
against your coat.

1412
02:00:53,875 --> 02:00:55,204
LAURA: Behave, all right?

1413
02:00:55,204 --> 02:00:57,588
LIAM: I'm going to feed you so much chocolate.

1414
02:00:57,588 --> 02:00:59,758
LAURA: That's really bad for him! Don't!

1415
02:00:59,758 --> 02:01:01,096
MARISHA: It'll be fine.

1416
02:01:01,096 --> 02:01:03,453
MATT: The sigil's starting to spark--

1417
02:01:03,453 --> 02:01:04,862
SAM: I jump in.

1418
02:01:04,862 --> 02:01:06,055
TRAVIS: I jump in, too.

1419
02:01:06,055 --> 02:01:10,434
MATT: Okay, so all of you who are going, you leap
in. You're staying and you're staying, correct?

1420
02:01:10,434 --> 02:01:15,279
And you're staying. All right, Keyleth, Percy and
Vax. All of you guys step in and all of a sudden

1421
02:01:15,279 --> 02:01:19,545
there's a familiar whoosh of some sort of dark
transference, you feel as if gravity for a moment

1422
02:01:19,712 --> 02:01:26,181
doesn't exist and your feet find purchase on some
sort of a wooden floor. The room is dark. You

1423
02:01:26,181 --> 02:01:30,632
glance about the immediate vicinity, and for those
of you who have low light, there's very little you

1424
02:01:30,632 --> 02:01:34,951
can actually make out other than the fact this is
a basement of some kind, and you are amidst a

1425
02:01:34,951 --> 02:01:36,989
bunch of sheet covered crates.

1426
02:01:36,989 --> 02:01:38,713
ORION: Light! (whoosh)

1427
02:01:38,713 --> 02:01:40,931
MATT: As the light fills the room, you look
around.

1428
02:01:40,931 --> 02:01:42,870
ORION: I cast it on Lockheed. On his tail.

1429
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:47,061
MATT: All right! Lockheed begins trying to shake
the light off the tail,

1430
02:01:47,061 --> 02:01:48,477
so it moves around a little bit.

1431
02:01:48,477 --> 02:01:57,718
ORION: Oh, Bensvelk! That means "good" in
Draconian. Bensvelk. And I feed him a treat.

1432
02:01:57,718 --> 02:02:03,185
MATT: (chuckles) All right! You look around the
room, there are about six or seven of these crates

1433
02:02:03,185 --> 02:02:06,558
immediately visible to you. They have sheets put
over them, they're different sizes, some sort of

1434
02:02:06,558 --> 02:02:09,731
storage room. There is a staircase that leads to
the floor above.

1435
02:02:09,731 --> 02:02:17,344
LAURA: Wait. Do they know we're coming? We're just
in the middle of their home now?

1436
02:02:17,344 --> 02:02:23,377
ORION: Yes, of course, Vex, they know we're
coming. I showed them the amulet, it was how we

1437
02:02:23,377 --> 02:02:26,563
got the sigil to come here to begin with. It's
fine. We're doing business with them.

1438
02:02:26,563 --> 02:02:28,755
It'll be good.

1439
02:02:28,755 --> 02:02:35,220
LAURA: Can I perception and make sure there's no
traps around us? Just to make sure. We're just

1440
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:43,986
popping in, and this is a magic house, am I right? So
I can't check for traps worth shit.

1441
02:02:43,986 --> 02:02:45,345
MATT: Room looks safe!

1442
02:02:45,345 --> 02:02:47,119
LAURA: Great. Good. Great.

1443
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:48,709
TRAVIS: Well, good. Let's get out of here.

1444
02:02:48,709 --> 02:02:55,851
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the
second floor. As you step up to the top you can

1445
02:02:55,851 --> 02:03:02,501
see there is light emanating from the top of the
staircase and a figure moves into the staircase. A

1446
02:03:02,501 --> 02:03:14,481
stout dwarven figure. This is the same individual
you spoke to previously. The dwarf steps to the

1447
02:03:14,481 --> 02:03:21,892
top and says, with an air of annoyance to the
voice. "All right. Waited up all night for you to

1448
02:03:21,892 --> 02:03:25,508
"arrive, and you never did. And you come here and
interrupt my breakfast."

1449
02:03:25,508 --> 02:03:30,906
ORION: I'm sorry. We thought you would like a
night's sleep before we intrude and--

1450
02:03:30,906 --> 02:03:36,268
MATT: "It's fine, step up the stairs, please." and
he steps out of the way, leads you into the

1451
02:03:36,268 --> 02:03:45,122
central chamber. This house is unfamiliar to all
but Scanlan, who turned invisible suddenly and

1452
02:03:45,122 --> 02:03:46,802
decided to wander in briefly.

1453
02:03:46,802 --> 02:03:50,003
SAM: Yes, I did. My old stomping grounds.

1454
02:03:50,003 --> 02:03:58,676
MATT: The classic "I don't know!" Looking about
it's very well-kept. It's an old house; the

1455
02:03:58,676 --> 02:04:03,191
ceilings are taller than you expect for a dwarf
type home. A lot of the ceilings are a little low

1456
02:04:03,191 --> 02:04:11,663
especially for you Grog, this one's built roomy.
There's actually a lot of cultivated cave plant

1457
02:04:11,663 --> 02:04:19,568
life, a lot of boxes that contain various
underground dwelling plants and other such

1458
02:04:19,568 --> 02:04:25,232
funguses. The air itself is mixtures of sweet and
pungent. Mixed almost as if there's a spice garden

1459
02:04:25,232 --> 02:04:29,071
somewhere, and you're not really able to take a
beat on what the actual interior would smell like,

1460
02:04:29,071 --> 02:04:37,607
it keeps changing around you. You're brought to
the main foyer area, and the dwarf turns back and

1461
02:04:37,607 --> 02:04:42,528
he says "All right, you've made your transference.
Where's the amulet?"

1462
02:04:42,528 --> 02:04:53,284
ORION: I'll open the Bag of Holding. And I'll take
it out. Before I actually go over and speak, I'm

1463
02:04:53,284 --> 02:05:00,165
going to turn to Scanlan and Vex. Is he the same
person who pays us for the other--

1464
02:05:00,165 --> 02:05:04,667
LAURA: No. I should probably go find that guy. Or
we can go all together.

1465
02:05:04,667 --> 02:05:06,905
ORION: I just didn't want to say the wrong thing
this time.

1466
02:05:06,905 --> 02:05:08,839
SAM: Sure, don't worry. You will.

1467
02:05:08,839 --> 02:05:21,319
ORION: Oh, sorry. Here is the amulet. And I show
him. Now, as far as trade, as it was rather taxing

1468
02:05:21,319 --> 02:05:23,547
to procure this particular artifact--

1469
02:05:23,547 --> 02:05:25,474
LAURA: Incredibly difficult, he means to say.

1470
02:05:25,474 --> 02:05:34,656
ORION: Yes, she's correct. I was wondering if we
could, perchance, trade it for a favor of your

1471
02:05:34,656 --> 02:05:36,432
arcane ability?

1472
02:05:36,432 --> 02:05:41,747
MATT: "It's funny, because I already did. I gave
you a permanent entry to my own household, my

1473
02:05:41,747 --> 02:05:47,850
"family's household, by offering you this sigil,
that gave you entrance to the interior of our

1474
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:52,721
"well-guarded estate. That was a trade enough. That
was what we agreed upon through the mirror."

1475
02:05:52,721 --> 02:05:54,615
ORION: That was just to get me here quicker, I
thought.

1476
02:05:54,615 --> 02:05:56,850
MATT: "So you come into my home and try to extort
me?"

1477
02:05:56,850 --> 02:06:06,771
ORION: No, not at all! Here's what happened, see.
We were on an adventure-- I pull out the carpet

1478
02:06:06,771 --> 02:06:14,555
out of my Bag of Holding. And this carpet was
enchanted once with the ability to fly, and it

1479
02:06:14,555 --> 02:06:22,939
helped us many times in many adventures. It was
de-chanted, I guess, if you want to say it. And we

1480
02:06:22,939 --> 02:06:29,611
need it re-chanted. And I thought that House
Thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to

1481
02:06:29,611 --> 02:06:34,305
have the ability to do such a thing. Maybe not as
it seems.

1482
02:06:34,305 --> 02:06:36,285
And I hand him the amulet as I'm saying this.

1483
02:06:36,285 --> 02:06:37,626
MATT: He takes the amulet.

1484
02:06:37,626 --> 02:06:43,156
ORION: And not as a trade, but as a favor for just
the effort, or maybe because I'm not strong enough

1485
02:06:43,156 --> 02:06:44,814
as a sorcerer myself to do it.

1486
02:06:44,814 --> 02:06:46,459
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1487
02:06:46,459 --> 02:06:51,012
LAURA: People speak very, very highly of your
abilities. Can I assist him?

1488
02:06:51,012 --> 02:07:02,724
MATT: It's not going to matter. You keep talking,
and as you're explaining this, he's not even

1489
02:07:02,724 --> 02:07:09,204
paying attention to you. The dwarf is staring at
the amulet, looking at the back of it where the

1490
02:07:09,204 --> 02:07:15,995
inscription is. And you swear for a minute, you
see what looks like a tear, gathering in the

1491
02:07:15,995 --> 02:07:21,021
corner of the eye of the dwarf, who then reaches
up and wipes it from the corner and takes the

1492
02:07:21,021 --> 02:07:26,954
amulet and puts it in the pocket and says, "My
apologies. Thank you for returning this. You were

1493
02:07:26,954 --> 02:07:28,878
"talking about the carpet, right?"

1494
02:07:28,878 --> 02:07:30,462
LAURA and ORION: Yes.

1495
02:07:30,462 --> 02:07:32,253
MATT: "You want it to be enchanted?"

1496
02:07:32,253 --> 02:07:38,724
LAURA: Well, we've heard very wonderful things
about your abilities and not many people can do

1497
02:07:38,724 --> 02:07:39,671
such a feat.

1498
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:42,773
MATT: "We have done a carpet before. Only one.
It's very possible."

1499
02:07:42,773 --> 02:07:45,513
LAURA: Did it look anything like this one?

1500
02:07:45,513 --> 02:07:54,067
MATT: "Not this pattern, no, that one was more of
a blue. I mean this can be enchanted, but the

1501
02:07:54,067 --> 02:07:57,086
"materials and the time put into it-- It's a very
pricey endeavor.

1502
02:07:57,086 --> 02:07:58,986
"A carpet of this size, especially."

1503
02:07:58,986 --> 02:08:00,287
SAM: How much?

1504
02:08:00,287 --> 02:08:11,228
MATT: "We're looking at the better part of a year
to enchant this and that'll cost you about, time

1505
02:08:11,228 --> 02:08:13,454
"included, that'll cost 50,000 gold pieces."

1506
02:08:13,454 --> 02:08:24,544
LAURA: Oh my god! I throw my hands up. I just
can't. I just can't! How did we not? Oh my god.

1507
02:08:24,544 --> 02:08:26,142
SAM: She's very fond of the carpet.

1508
02:08:26,142 --> 02:08:28,598
TRAVIS: I put my arm around Vex and try and
console her.

1509
02:08:28,598 --> 02:08:33,943
LAURA: 50? A year! Why?! Thank you so much.

1510
02:08:33,943 --> 02:08:36,187
MATT: "Well I mean, there might be smaller ones
you might be able to find elsewhere."

1511
02:08:36,187 --> 02:08:40,231
LAURA: No, I know it's a really beautiful carpet,
and it would cost a lot of

1512
02:08:40,231 --> 02:08:41,880
money to fix up, I understand.

1513
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:45,021
SAM: She loves the hand-woven carpets. It's just
very tragic.

1514
02:08:45,021 --> 02:08:46,871
MATT: "All right, well--"

1515
02:08:46,871 --> 02:08:49,959
TRAVIS: Shall we go get our money now?

1516
02:08:49,959 --> 02:08:52,425
SAM: Yes, who's the man we need to see about
that?

1517
02:08:52,425 --> 02:08:55,449
LAURA: Oh, that's the Kraghammer-- We go to see--

1518
02:08:55,449 --> 02:08:56,779
LIAM: Johnny Kraghammer?

1519
02:08:56,779 --> 02:08:58,531
LAURA: Johnny Kraghammer.

1520
02:08:58,531 --> 02:09:01,326
SAM: Nostoc Greyspine?

1521
02:09:01,326 --> 02:09:03,276
LAURA: It was Greyspine.

1522
02:09:03,276 --> 02:09:08,862
MATT: Nostoc Greyspine. You're escorted out of the
House Thunderbrand. Make your way down to the

1523
02:09:08,862 --> 02:09:14,622
quarry, at the very bottom level of Kraghammer,
once again. It's been a long time since you've

1524
02:09:14,622 --> 02:09:19,691
been in this portion of the world, let alone this
city, where you started this leg of your entire

1525
02:09:19,691 --> 02:09:35,700
journey. You do make your way down into this area
to Lord Nostoc Greyspine's proper office, the one

1526
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:43,645
where you managed to procure his expensive wine
and make this venture the very beginning. You step

1527
02:09:43,645 --> 02:09:47,573
into the familiar halls. As soon as you enter, you
have a brief discussion with the guy at the front,

1528
02:09:47,573 --> 02:09:52,081
who recognizes you and leads you into the office.
There, waiting, behind his desk is Nostoc, who's

1529
02:09:52,081 --> 02:09:58,200
currently in the process of looking out the window
over the entire quarry of his mine. He turns over

1530
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:59,651
his shoulder, looking at the rest of you.

1531
02:09:59,651 --> 02:10:08,149
"Well, I'm surprised to see you all alive.
Just assumed you'd all got yourselves killed, like

1532
02:10:08,149 --> 02:10:11,783
"the usual bumpkins who come wandering this far
down in the mountain."

1533
02:10:11,783 --> 02:10:22,856
LAURA: No. We did not die. We, in fact, succeeded
in taking care of those creatures.

1534
02:10:22,856 --> 02:10:25,888
Under-- dark-- carpet.

1535
02:10:25,888 --> 02:10:30,123
SAM: She's-- That time of the month.

1536
02:10:30,123 --> 02:10:38,084
LAURA: Oh! Excuse me. We came to collect the money
you owed us for completing

1537
02:10:38,084 --> 02:10:39,739
the mission you sent us on.

1538
02:10:39,739 --> 02:10:44,761
MATT: "Ah yes, of course. Of course. Understood.
What was the price we had agreed for that one?"

1539
02:10:44,761 --> 02:10:53,513
LAURA: Oh, it was 30,000 gold, plus all the extras
for the scalps that we acquired.

1540
02:10:53,513 --> 02:10:57,761
TRAVIS: I open the bag of holding and go, Here,
here's one brain chunk.

1541
02:10:57,761 --> 02:10:59,329
And I dump it on the floor.

1542
02:10:59,329 --> 02:11:06,123
MATT: As a note, I'm pretty sure at practically no
point in your adventure to the Underdark did you

1543
02:11:06,123 --> 02:11:09,083
ever say you were scalping a creature.

1544
02:11:09,083 --> 02:11:10,812
LIAM: We're above base--

1545
02:11:10,812 --> 02:11:14,560
MARISHA: We totally forgot about that.

1546
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,895
MATT: You completely, in the entirety of that
adventure, didn't collect a single scalp from

1547
02:11:17,895 --> 02:11:19,299
anything you killed.

1548
02:11:19,299 --> 02:11:28,271
TRAVIS: I thought I grabbed the brain chunk. I
thought I grabbed an arm, too. There was just an

1549
02:11:28,271 --> 02:11:30,897
arm from the stitched guy, and I just grabbed it.

1550
02:11:30,897 --> 02:11:35,026
LIAM: An arm is not a scalp. It's this.

1551
02:11:35,026 --> 02:11:43,975
MATT: Nostoc also looks at you and goes, "And
while I respect your memory, a dwarf's mind is

1552
02:11:43,975 --> 02:11:51,257
"like a trap that you can't escape. I believe the
agreed upon price was 25,000 gold pieces."

1553
02:11:51,257 --> 02:11:53,813
LAURA: Oh it was? That is so weird, I remember
30.

1554
02:11:53,813 --> 02:11:59,342
MATT: "I don't even know what you fought. If
you're going to collect your money, tell me what

1555
02:11:59,342 --> 02:12:01,241
"the hell you freaking killed."

1556
02:12:01,241 --> 02:12:05,052
LAURA: Mind flayers! A beholder! Have you heard of
a beholder?

1557
02:12:05,052 --> 02:12:06,479
MATT: "You fought a beholder?"

1558
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:08,521
LAURA: We fought a fucking beholder.

1559
02:12:08,521 --> 02:12:11,390
MATT: "Really? And you're all still alive?"

1560
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:15,797
SAM: Well no, not all of us. If you'll recall
there were more of us when we came down here. And

1561
02:12:15,797 --> 02:12:18,527
some of us aren't here because they died.

1562
02:12:18,527 --> 02:12:20,593
TRAVIS: I start pretending to cry.

1563
02:12:20,593 --> 02:12:22,181
MATT: Make a deception check.

1564
02:12:22,181 --> 02:12:24,079
LAURA: That's really good.

1565
02:12:24,079 --> 02:12:26,295
SAM: 21.

1566
02:12:26,295 --> 02:12:32,995
LAURA: I start thinking about the carpet and I
really do start crying.

1567
02:12:32,995 --> 02:12:37,226
SAM: So before you berate us, know that we are
mourning the loss of two of our members.

1568
02:12:37,226 --> 02:12:39,197
And a bear!

1569
02:12:39,197 --> 02:12:41,472
LAURA: (sobbing) And my bear!

1570
02:12:41,472 --> 02:12:43,981
MATT: "Beholder, you say?"

1571
02:12:43,981 --> 02:12:45,677
LAURA: It was really big.

1572
02:12:45,677 --> 02:12:50,097
MATT: "What else did you encounter?"

1573
02:12:50,097 --> 02:12:51,294
LAURA: Illithid.

1574
02:12:51,294 --> 02:12:55,148
SAM: Lots of illithid. A whole city of illithid.

1575
02:12:55,148 --> 02:12:57,050
MATT: "A whole city of illithid?"

1576
02:12:57,050 --> 02:13:01,175
LAURA: We destroyed half of an elder brain-- Part
of an elder brain.

1577
02:13:01,175 --> 02:13:03,297
TRAVIS: And there were all these dark--

1578
02:13:03,297 --> 02:13:08,141
LAURA: Dwarves! There were dark dwarves. Duergar.

1579
02:13:08,141 --> 02:13:17,671
SAM: They were mind controlled. It was crazy,
we're not just making this up.

1580
02:13:17,671 --> 02:13:19,333
It really happened.

1581
02:13:19,333 --> 02:13:23,963
TRAVIS: There were these wrinkled testicles that
were walking around on feet.

1582
02:13:23,963 --> 02:13:26,668
LAURA: He almost died! Just from this one little
brain.

1583
02:13:26,668 --> 02:13:31,391
TRAVIS: Strange thing. If you're stupid, and it
looks at you with its wrinkled testicle face?

1584
02:13:31,391 --> 02:13:34,415
You go unconscious.

1585
02:13:34,415 --> 02:13:38,054
MATT: "I know the creatures you speak of. I've
dealt with my share of duergar, though--"

1586
02:13:38,054 --> 02:13:41,867
ORION: I completely stayed away from it, because I
was terrified.

1587
02:13:41,867 --> 02:13:43,975
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1588
02:13:43,975 --> 02:13:46,843
LIAM: (singing) Roll high!

1589
02:13:46,843 --> 02:13:50,786
LAURA: Are we all rolling? Because we're all
talking.

1590
02:13:50,786 --> 02:13:52,785
MATT: You were spearheading that part of the
group.

1591
02:13:52,785 --> 02:13:54,248
LAURA: I was? I thought Scanlan was.

1592
02:13:54,248 --> 02:13:55,862
MATT: Scanlan already made his roll.

1593
02:13:55,862 --> 02:13:58,255
TRAVIS: What about giving her advantage because I
was talking about testicles?

1594
02:13:58,255 --> 02:14:01,730
MATT: No testicle advantage on that roll. I'm
sorry.

1595
02:14:01,730 --> 02:14:05,482
LIAM: In what circumstance would testicle
advantage come into play?

1596
02:14:05,482 --> 02:14:07,996
SAM: At Gilmore's.

1597
02:14:07,996 --> 02:14:10,359
LAURA: That would be 11.

1598
02:14:10,359 --> 02:14:22,252
MATT: 11? "Looking at your number, I can see that
you've certainly encountered some dangerous things

1599
02:14:22,252 --> 02:14:28,166
"in your travels, taken some losses. And I will
say, since you've left, we haven't had at least

1600
02:14:28,166 --> 02:14:34,055
"one excursion interrupting our mine, which has
been very helpful. The fact that you've returned

1601
02:14:34,055 --> 02:14:41,947
"with these tales-- I believe most of it. I'd say,
given that circumstance, I'd be happy to pay you

1602
02:14:41,947 --> 02:14:45,515
"up to 18,000 gold pieces."

1603
02:14:45,515 --> 02:14:49,073
SAM: I am going to cast Suggestion on him.

1604
02:14:49,073 --> 02:14:52,212
LAURA: 18,000 gold in addition to the--

1605
02:14:52,212 --> 02:14:53,454
TRAVIS: He's casting.

1606
02:14:53,454 --> 02:14:55,025
LIAM: He's doing it!

1607
02:14:55,025 --> 02:14:59,290
MATT: So what's the DC? You don't have your hand
cone.

1608
02:14:59,290 --> 02:15:02,072
SAM: I don't have my hand cone out. 17.

1609
02:15:02,072 --> 02:15:05,488
MATT: Natural one.

1610
02:15:05,488 --> 02:15:09,637
LAURA: Money!

1611
02:15:09,637 --> 02:15:11,709
MATT: All right, what are you suggesting?

1612
02:15:11,709 --> 02:15:16,073
SAM: I'm going to suggest to him that he is an
honorable man and we had a deal. And that he

1613
02:15:16,073 --> 02:15:21,252
should honor it, to the fullest extent of the
word.

1614
02:15:21,252 --> 02:15:23,343
MATT: He looks about at the rest of you guys.

1615
02:15:23,343 --> 02:15:33,994
SAM: I also, as a cantrip-- oh god, I hope it's
not concentration. Forget it. I'm not going to.

1616
02:15:33,994 --> 02:15:44,144
MATT: "The Greyspine name holds weight in this
city, the last thing I want is that that be

1617
02:15:44,144 --> 02:15:56,401
"sullied by miscommunication. If we agreed to
25,000, I'll pay 25,000. But I hear a single

1618
02:15:56,401 --> 02:16:05,997
"disagreement out there, or a bad word that came
from your lips about our exchange here, and I'm

1619
02:16:05,997 --> 02:16:07,788
"going to come for the rest of that money."

1620
02:16:07,788 --> 02:16:10,352
TRAVIS: I hold up the duergar's severed arm, and I
curl all the fingers in

1621
02:16:10,352 --> 02:16:13,291
and make a thumbs-up like that.

1622
02:16:13,291 --> 02:16:25,893
MATT: He looks back at you, very slowly, as you do
this, with a tense stare. (laughs) "All right, all

1623
02:16:25,893 --> 02:16:30,143
"right." And he starts bringing up coin purse,
after coin purse, after coin purse, counting it up

1624
02:16:30,143 --> 02:16:35,167
as he does. It takes him about five minutes or so,
and eventually he counts out, at your vision to

1625
02:16:35,167 --> 02:16:42,100
improve it, 25,000 gold pieces and platinum pieces
and pushes it across to you guys. You've retrieved

1626
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:46,068
that. No additional funds, as no scalps were
collected, but you do get 25,000.

1627
02:16:46,068 --> 02:16:47,563
TRAVIS: Do you want the--

1628
02:16:47,563 --> 02:16:50,960
MATT: "You can hold onto that, thank you."

1629
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:53,280
TRAVIS: You're very gracious.

1630
02:16:53,280 --> 02:17:03,352
LAURA: (singing) 25,000 gold in my hands right
now. Thank you so much. This won't make up for the

1631
02:17:03,352 --> 02:17:10,159
lost lives we have suffered, but-- (choking up) It
helps.

1632
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:22,731
MATT: "I'm glad. And I'm sorry for your losses.
Perhaps you'll be less stupid in the future."

1633
02:17:22,731 --> 02:17:24,288
TRAVIS: Probably not. We should go.

1634
02:17:24,288 --> 02:17:28,982
SAM: Remember the blood we spilled for your people
and your safety.

1635
02:17:28,982 --> 02:17:30,394
LAURA: Vox Machina!

1636
02:17:30,394 --> 02:17:34,023
(laughter)

1637
02:17:34,023 --> 02:17:38,093
SAM: Oh! I go to give him a business card, but
then I realize I never got them printed so.

1638
02:17:38,093 --> 02:17:42,271
LAURA: Also! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Great
work.

1639
02:17:42,271 --> 02:17:48,181
SAM: Yes, Gilmore's! If you're ever overdark, come
check it out. It's a great store.

1640
02:17:48,181 --> 02:17:53,465
MATT: Like an unexpected web pop-up, he gives you
an expression of: where is this coming from?

1641
02:17:53,465 --> 02:17:55,975
"Get out! Get out of my office!"

1642
02:17:55,975 --> 02:18:01,205
TRAVIS: Tiberius, how do we get out of here
quickly?

1643
02:18:01,205 --> 02:18:04,732
ORION: I start going back to the chamber and I'll
do the spell again.

1644
02:18:04,732 --> 02:18:07,120
SAM: Can you do it again? Don't you have to rest?

1645
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,585
MATT: You can do it twice? 6th-level spell twice?

1646
02:18:10,585 --> 02:18:12,612
ORION: No it's a 5th-level spell.

1647
02:18:12,612 --> 02:18:14,021
MATT: What? The teleportation?

1648
02:18:14,021 --> 02:18:15,799
ORION: Yeah, it's a 5th-level spell.

1649
02:18:15,799 --> 02:18:17,215
MATT: I think it is. You're right.

1650
02:18:17,215 --> 02:18:26,852
ORION: Yes, very well. And then we'll go back to--
I'll choose Emon.

1651
02:18:26,852 --> 02:18:38,730
LIAM: Excuse me? As soon as they left, Trinket and
I, we left, and I went to the nearest shop and

1652
02:18:38,730 --> 02:18:45,231
bought a lot of pink ribbon, and I have been
furiously tying bows all through Trinket's hair,

1653
02:18:45,231 --> 02:18:48,229
the entire time they've been gone.

1654
02:18:48,229 --> 02:18:55,357
MARISHA: Actually I'll help with that campaign. I
do some braids, and add some flowers.

1655
02:18:55,357 --> 02:19:02,487
LIAM: Keyleth has been weaving flowers in, and I
have been knotting braids. Started at the head,

1656
02:19:02,487 --> 02:19:07,154
and then worked all the way down Trinket's back
and down the tail. The entire time. Feverishly.

1657
02:19:07,154 --> 02:19:11,504
TALIESIN: I come up for lunch. Keyleth, can I
borrow you for a-- what in good god?!

1658
02:19:11,504 --> 02:19:17,530
MARISHA: Is it important? Do you need me right
now? This is pretty important.

1659
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:19,277
TALIESIN: Is Trinket comfortable with this?

1660
02:19:19,277 --> 02:19:24,482
MARISHA: He's so comfortable! Look, I gave him
plenty of treats, he doesn't even know what's

1661
02:19:24,482 --> 02:19:25,803
happening.

1662
02:19:25,803 --> 02:19:31,255
MATT: (sad bear noises) This mournful low,
guttural groan. You're pretty sure it translates

1663
02:19:31,255 --> 02:19:34,820
to, "Why?"

1664
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:37,951
LIAM: I feed him a piece of chocolate at that
moment.

1665
02:19:37,951 --> 02:19:39,777
LAURA: Don't give him chocolate!

1666
02:19:39,777 --> 02:19:41,453
MATT: He licks it off.

1667
02:19:41,453 --> 02:19:46,303
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can I borrow you? When you have
a moment.

1668
02:19:46,303 --> 02:19:52,579
MARISHA: Ten more minutes. I'll be down in ten
minutes.

1669
02:19:52,579 --> 02:19:56,380
MATT: It takes about ten minutes before the keep
doors open and the rest of your party returns.

1670
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:58,667
MARISHA: And I run downstairs really fast.

1671
02:19:58,667 --> 02:20:06,465
LIAM: Side note, I let Trinket give me bear-kisses
all over my face. Vex never lets Trinket kiss her

1672
02:20:06,465 --> 02:20:12,568
face, and it's so sad, and I let him just drool
all over my face everywhere.

1673
02:20:12,568 --> 02:20:17,107
TALIESIN: I feel like we're playing out some
real-world psychodrama here.

1674
02:20:17,107 --> 02:20:25,477
ORION: As this is going on, I want to turn to
Scanlan and go, Gnome. I have an idea that I want

1675
02:20:25,477 --> 02:20:38,864
to run by you. No, your name's Scanlan. Okay. I
was going to go and do this, just on a whim as I

1676
02:20:38,864 --> 02:20:47,217
usually do, but I was thinking that we should
speak to Allura, and I don't think I should speak

1677
02:20:47,217 --> 02:20:48,362
to her alone.

1678
02:20:48,362 --> 02:20:53,776
SAM: I'm sorry. I must be asleep. Are you planning
something? Ahead of time.

1679
02:20:53,776 --> 02:20:54,992
ORION: Yes.

1680
02:20:54,992 --> 02:20:57,428
SAM: Wow. That's amazing!

1681
02:20:57,428 --> 02:21:04,446
ORION: You know. Like I told Vax, you just have to
chill out sometimes, and I'm like, well, maybe I

1682
02:21:04,446 --> 02:21:08,583
should run it by the man with the mouth.

1683
02:21:08,583 --> 02:21:17,342
SAM: Well, you've come to the right place. I do
have quite a mouth. Yes, let's go talk to her.

1684
02:21:17,342 --> 02:21:21,230
Wait, she's the woman you fancy quite a bit, isn't
that true?

1685
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:26,118
ORION: Yes. This is more business rather than
denied pleasure.

1686
02:21:26,118 --> 02:21:28,948
SAM: What do you want to speak with her about?

1687
02:21:28,948 --> 02:21:34,187
ORION: Well, as far as I see it, there's no other
way to get our carpet reenchanted. I want to

1688
02:21:34,187 --> 02:21:41,436
confess what we did to her, and hopefully she
takes mercy and helps us out with this, as we've

1689
02:21:41,436 --> 02:21:43,282
helped her out far beyond anything that--

1690
02:21:43,282 --> 02:21:47,683
MATT: At this point in the discussion, you guys
all look up and see, sitting in the center of the

1691
02:21:47,683 --> 02:21:56,934
main foyer area of Greyskull, a very mighty bear,
brought down low, sitting covered in pink ribbons,

1692
02:21:56,934 --> 02:22:01,243
looking forward, going (distressed bear noises)

1693
02:22:01,243 --> 02:22:03,207
SAM: See? I told you it was a girl!

1694
02:22:03,207 --> 02:22:07,204
LAURA: Trinket! You look so cute.

1695
02:22:07,204 --> 02:22:09,061
MARISHA: Oh, I knew she'd love it!

1696
02:22:09,061 --> 02:22:15,090
LAURA: We need to get these off of you
immediately. But you look really, really cute. And

1697
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:19,388
I scratch his little ears. How dare--

1698
02:22:19,388 --> 02:22:25,567
MATT: You look over, too, there are traces of
chocolate smears across the face of Vax.

1699
02:22:25,567 --> 02:22:37,604
ORION: Vex. No, Vex. Yes. Stand over-- and I use
my Still Image and take a little spell of her--

1700
02:22:37,604 --> 02:22:39,400
TALIESIN: Say it. Staffie. Just say staffie.

1701
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:42,941
ORION: No, but it's of her, it's a youie.

1702
02:22:42,941 --> 02:22:45,308
TRAVIS: But it's with your staff.

1703
02:22:45,308 --> 02:22:49,995
LIAM: What is the piece of art immortalized upon?
A piece of wood?

1704
02:22:49,995 --> 02:22:53,602
ORION: Oh. And I open my Scroll of Telescription,
I'm like, see?

1705
02:22:53,602 --> 02:22:59,714
LAURA: Oh look, now I can remember this moment
forever. Thank you. Trinket,

1706
02:22:59,714 --> 02:23:02,290
let's go get you a bath.

1707
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:04,284
TRAVIS: We got so much money.

1708
02:23:04,284 --> 02:23:08,597
LAURA: I go and put it in the party funds. We got
our gold.

1709
02:23:08,597 --> 02:23:11,879
SAM: Good job. We can pay back Gilmore.

1710
02:23:11,879 --> 02:23:18,077
LIAM: For my share? Just my share.

1711
02:23:18,077 --> 02:23:21,511
LAURA: Are we splitting up all the party gold
now?

1712
02:23:21,511 --> 02:23:29,874
ORION: Vex? I give her the picture. Now you have a
picture of your bear with the silly bows.

1713
02:23:29,874 --> 02:23:32,039
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

1714
02:23:32,039 --> 02:23:37,569
LIAM: And I take advantage of her good mood and
say, I just want 1,200 gold, and I won't ask for

1715
02:23:37,569 --> 02:23:39,501
any more of it, any of the amount.

1716
02:23:39,501 --> 02:23:41,793
ORION: Ooh, yes, I would like the same thing.

1717
02:23:41,793 --> 02:23:47,637
LAURA: Do you want me to just split up all the
party gold right now?

1718
02:23:47,637 --> 02:23:52,810
SAM: No, I don't, no. Just give us a quick
stipend. Give us each 1,500 and let's move on.

1719
02:23:52,810 --> 02:23:59,254
LAURA: Everybody gets 1,500. Is everybody happy?
Trinket, are you just so thrilled?

1720
02:23:59,254 --> 02:24:01,789
MATT: (sad bear noises) He's pulling them out with
his claws as best he can.

1721
02:24:01,789 --> 02:24:04,226
LAURA: Oh, sweetie. Bath time.

1722
02:24:04,226 --> 02:24:15,537
MATT: Trinket stands up and heads out to the front
courtyard. All right, so it's 1,500 times seven.

1723
02:24:15,537 --> 02:24:18,131
LAURA: I'll do the math.

1724
02:24:18,131 --> 02:24:21,042
SAM: Let's go do our recon. Who's doing it?

1725
02:24:21,042 --> 02:24:22,645
TRAVIS: Are we going to kill them?

1726
02:24:22,645 --> 02:24:24,847
SAM: No, we're just going to go spy on them.

1727
02:24:24,847 --> 02:24:29,632
TALIESIN: I'd like to finish my morning crafting
before moving into the evening crafting. I'm going

1728
02:24:29,632 --> 02:24:32,965
to have help. I'm working on project number
three.

1729
02:24:32,965 --> 02:24:39,289
MATT: Okay. This is probably going to take you the
rest of the week. It's an extensive project.

1730
02:24:39,289 --> 02:24:44,213
TALIESIN: If I have a little help? This is
something I've been

1731
02:24:44,213 --> 02:24:45,694
tinkering with for quite a while, now.

1732
02:24:45,694 --> 02:24:48,788
MATT: Right, but it's also the most complicated
thing, outside of the gun,

1733
02:24:48,788 --> 02:24:50,259
that you've constructed.

1734
02:24:50,259 --> 02:24:51,870
TRAVIS: We've got a couple more days, too.

1735
02:24:51,870 --> 02:24:55,960
ORION: How many days have passed, since we've been
doing this? Two?

1736
02:24:55,960 --> 02:25:01,682
LIAM: Percy, you go to work. We'll figure out
everything else.

1737
02:25:01,682 --> 02:25:03,274
MATT: It's up to you.

1738
02:25:03,274 --> 02:25:08,180
TALIESIN: Do you think I'll have time to finish
everything that's on my list, if I roll well?

1739
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:11,156
MATT: Probably not everything. You'll have to
choose between a couple.

1740
02:25:11,156 --> 02:25:13,536
LIAM: What if he rolls a 20?

1741
02:25:13,536 --> 02:25:22,466
TALIESIN: Because I was going to have Keyleth
lightning spell to help set the battery for the--

1742
02:25:22,466 --> 02:25:24,681
MATT: Right. Well, that is technically an
enchantment.

1743
02:25:24,681 --> 02:25:27,841
TALIESIN: If it just uses it to start a charge?

1744
02:25:27,841 --> 02:25:29,467
MATT: Oh, to start a charge? Then you can do it.

1745
02:25:29,467 --> 02:25:31,224
TALIESIN: Okay. Yeah, I was going to Frankenstein
this.

1746
02:25:31,224 --> 02:25:35,709
MATT: Okay. We can begin the roll now.

1747
02:25:35,709 --> 02:25:37,014
TALIESIN: All right.

1748
02:25:37,014 --> 02:25:39,035
MATT: Go ahead and make a tinkering roll.

1749
02:25:39,035 --> 02:25:41,416
TALIESIN: That's better. 20.

1750
02:25:41,416 --> 02:25:48,057
MATT: 20, okay. Not actually doing the charge yet,
because you're building the basis of the

1751
02:25:48,057 --> 02:25:54,017
structure. You help him downstairs in his workshop
with the various materials to begin crafting the

1752
02:25:54,017 --> 02:26:02,492
actual shell of the the item. What else are you
guys doing?

1753
02:26:02,492 --> 02:26:03,906
SAM: Let's go do recon.

1754
02:26:03,906 --> 02:26:10,373
LIAM: Yeah, what are we checking out, though? I
mean, it's not like the Briarwoods are out in

1755
02:26:10,373 --> 02:26:12,679
public. We don't know anything about them.

1756
02:26:12,679 --> 02:26:14,962
LAURA: We need to ask around town about the
Briarwoods.

1757
02:26:14,962 --> 02:26:19,533
SAM: We need to get into the Briarwoods' estate
and talk to them.

1758
02:26:19,533 --> 02:26:23,406
MARISHA: Well, they're not local. They're coming
into town.

1759
02:26:23,406 --> 02:26:27,610
They're coming into town in five to seven days.

1760
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:33,731
MATT: No, they're arriving now in six days and
arriving for the actual feast.

1761
02:26:33,731 --> 02:26:35,384
SAM: Where's the feast to be held?

1762
02:26:35,384 --> 02:26:36,939
MATT: It's to be held in the palace.

1763
02:26:36,939 --> 02:26:38,797
LAURA: Shit. We can't do any spying.

1764
02:26:38,797 --> 02:26:40,287
MARISHA: Not on them.

1765
02:26:40,287 --> 02:26:47,416
ORION: All we can do is get gear and do things and
we can sleep for a few days.

1766
02:26:47,416 --> 02:26:50,365
TALIESIN: You can help me in the workshop.

1767
02:26:50,365 --> 02:26:55,166
MARISHA: Make a plan. Maybe make a plan? We don't
really have a plan.

1768
02:26:55,166 --> 02:27:02,047
LIAM: Can you remind me and the group, the dinner,
I know it's with the Briarwoods, but who else? Is

1769
02:27:02,047 --> 02:27:03,686
it with Uriel or who is it with?

1770
02:27:03,686 --> 02:27:07,580
MATT: It's with Uriel, the Council, which is why
you guys were invited, also because Percy asked.

1771
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:15,629
And the Briarwoods. It is partially to discuss and
celebrate the agreed-upon construction of a bridge

1772
02:27:15,629 --> 02:27:21,369
that goes across the Shearing Channel at the far
northeastern side of the continent of Tal'Dorei.

1773
02:27:21,369 --> 02:27:26,828
There is a large channel where these two large
mountain ranges, which are the closest the two

1774
02:27:26,828 --> 02:27:31,394
continents are to each other, but it's a very
treacherous pass of water, so any trade having to

1775
02:27:31,394 --> 02:27:36,534
be done has had to travel southward, in a big arc
around the bottom of the island, or via

1776
02:27:36,534 --> 02:27:40,981
skyship, both very expensive. This bridge will
enable a much faster trade route between the two

1777
02:27:40,981 --> 02:27:47,062
continents, and Whitestone has essentially been in
charge of spearheading the construction of this

1778
02:27:47,062 --> 02:27:51,723
bridge and making this agreement with Uriel, that
would be overall helpful for both continents. And

1779
02:27:51,723 --> 02:27:55,407
since they've agreed upon this, they've been
invited here to Emon for the first time to have

1780
02:27:55,407 --> 02:27:57,696
dinner with the Council and Uriel to celebrate
it.

1781
02:27:57,696 --> 02:28:00,069
LIAM: We maybe want to talk to Uriel.

1782
02:28:00,069 --> 02:28:05,280
LAURA: Maybe. Maybe you guys should go, because I
want to spend the next few days training Trinket

1783
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:10,748
how to roly-poly roll forward and bludgeon people
with his armor.

1784
02:28:10,748 --> 02:28:14,660
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1785
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:22,431
MARISHA: I mean, the only thing I can think--
Percy. Do you still have an idea of what the

1786
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:23,924
Briarwoods look like?

1787
02:28:23,924 --> 02:28:25,486
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

1788
02:28:25,486 --> 02:28:28,519
MARISHA: I could attempt another scrying spell.
Could even possibly

1789
02:28:28,519 --> 02:28:31,246
go to Allura for help and try again.

1790
02:28:31,246 --> 02:28:37,522
TALIESIN: See if Allura will come here, because I
want to keep working. And I'll also say we should

1791
02:28:37,522 --> 02:28:41,427
send word to Uriel that I will not be myself at
the--

1792
02:28:41,427 --> 02:28:43,844
SAM: Yes, that might be very strange.

1793
02:28:43,844 --> 02:28:48,041
LAURA: We should maybe send word to him that the
Briarwoods should be watched.

1794
02:28:48,041 --> 02:28:51,776
TALIESIN: The less we say, the better.

1795
02:28:51,776 --> 02:28:54,420
MARISHA: What makes you say that?

1796
02:28:54,420 --> 02:29:04,305
LIAM: You think Uriel might be in the Briarwoods'
pocket and pass on that we're aware.

1797
02:29:04,305 --> 02:29:06,741
TALIESIN: It would not be the first time.

1798
02:29:06,741 --> 02:29:08,130
LIAM: That's true.

1799
02:29:08,130 --> 02:29:13,189
SAM: Yes, even if you wear this disguise hat,
Percy, how are you going to get into this event?

1800
02:29:13,189 --> 02:29:16,377
It's a private event. You can't just be some
random person.

1801
02:29:16,377 --> 02:29:19,571
TALIESIN: I will be with you, and if we can let
Uriel know that

1802
02:29:19,571 --> 02:29:22,048
I am coming under a false pretense.

1803
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:24,975
SAM: Yeah, but that's going to arouse all kinds of
suspicion.

1804
02:29:24,975 --> 02:29:29,069
MARISHA: Exactly, yeah, if we tell Uriel you're
coming as someone else, he's going to ask why.

1805
02:29:29,069 --> 02:29:31,254
TALIESIN: He knows that I don't trust them.

1806
02:29:31,254 --> 02:29:32,925
TRAVIS: He does?

1807
02:29:32,925 --> 02:29:34,239
TALIESIN: He does.

1808
02:29:34,239 --> 02:29:36,604
MARISHA: Wait, who was it that came and talked to
us? Who was that?

1809
02:29:36,604 --> 02:29:38,985
MATT: That was Seeker Asum.

1810
02:29:38,985 --> 02:29:45,220
MARISHA: I was going to say, it was Seeker Asum,
but he didn't say that Uriel had his doubts, he

1811
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:46,751
said he had his doubts.

1812
02:29:46,751 --> 02:29:48,432
TALIESIN: So let's let Asum know.

1813
02:29:48,432 --> 02:29:50,489
MARISHA: Let Asum know.

1814
02:29:50,489 --> 02:29:52,978
SAM: Why don't you disguise yourself as--

1815
02:29:52,978 --> 02:29:54,953
TALIESIN: Burt Reynolds.

1816
02:29:54,953 --> 02:29:58,824
SAM: What about Vax? He can sneak in.

1817
02:29:58,824 --> 02:30:02,798
TALIESIN: Will the hat let me choose who I look
like?

1818
02:30:02,798 --> 02:30:06,739
MATT: The hat, like any Minor Illusion spell, you
can choose your appearance.

1819
02:30:06,739 --> 02:30:09,404
TALIESIN: How much of a shape-change can I--

1820
02:30:09,404 --> 02:30:11,884
MATT: I mean, you can look pretty close to
somebody else.

1821
02:30:11,884 --> 02:30:13,865
TALIESIN: Could I look like Grog?

1822
02:30:13,865 --> 02:30:22,228
MATT: You could. But as it is an illusion, there
is no physical-- so if somebody were to reach up

1823
02:30:22,228 --> 02:30:24,149
and touch your shoulder, it would just pass
through.

1824
02:30:24,149 --> 02:30:29,189
MARISHA: Right, and your voice doesn't change, so
you probably don't want to try

1825
02:30:29,189 --> 02:30:31,158
and sound like Grog all night.

1826
02:30:31,158 --> 02:30:33,209
TALIESIN: Well, I was actually thinking of Pike,
but.

1827
02:30:33,209 --> 02:30:37,673
SAM: Ooh, Pike. You could be Pike. You would be a
very big Pike.

1828
02:30:37,673 --> 02:30:45,615
LIAM: Percival, there's nothing I want more than
for you to take Bad News and unload it on every

1829
02:30:45,615 --> 02:30:58,476
one of those motherfucking shits, but if you're me
and I'm nobody, if I'm a ghost, I can help take

1830
02:30:58,476 --> 02:31:00,140
out one or two.

1831
02:31:00,140 --> 02:31:03,506
TALIESIN: You'll stick to the shadows, and I'll be
you.

1832
02:31:03,506 --> 02:31:07,806
MARISHA: Not to be-- sorry, you were going to say
something?

1833
02:31:07,806 --> 02:31:10,297
TALIESIN: No, that's actually a pretty good plan.

1834
02:31:10,297 --> 02:31:11,637
LIAM: How many days left?

1835
02:31:11,637 --> 02:31:12,781
MATT: Six.

1836
02:31:12,781 --> 02:31:22,267
LIAM: Can I ask you a question, DM? I have in the
assassin perks. I think it says seven days, I can

1837
02:31:22,267 --> 02:31:29,749
be anybody. As long as I don't do anything else
and I work on getting the right papers, and no one

1838
02:31:29,749 --> 02:31:40,489
will know who I am, 100%, but it's six days, so am
I shit out of luck? This is why I was talking

1839
02:31:40,489 --> 02:31:42,357
about it yesterday, motherfuckers.

1840
02:31:42,357 --> 02:31:45,150
TALIESIN: That's okay. It's a good plan. I think
this plan is a good plan.

1841
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:48,993
ORION: I think we'll be fine, because I have
privilege perk.

1842
02:31:48,993 --> 02:31:51,195
LIAM: You make me invisible.

1843
02:31:51,195 --> 02:31:53,953
SAM: I can also do that. Or he can.

1844
02:31:53,953 --> 02:31:55,073
LIAM: Yeah, one of you two.

1845
02:31:55,073 --> 02:32:01,306
SAM: No problem. I know it's a few days off, but
we should have some sort of safe word. Some sort

1846
02:32:01,306 --> 02:32:07,545
of attack word. Grog, any suggestions?

1847
02:32:07,545 --> 02:32:08,708
TRAVIS: Jenga.

1848
02:32:08,708 --> 02:32:10,976
ALL: Jenga.

1849
02:32:10,976 --> 02:32:20,515
MARISHA: I like that. We're not hired to kill the
Briarwoods, and not to be that member of the group

1850
02:32:20,515 --> 02:32:27,142
that has a golden heart and wants to ruin
everyone's fun. I don't want to stand between you

1851
02:32:27,142 --> 02:32:36,796
and your revenge that you are absolutely owed,
Percy, but are you sure this is what you want? Is

1852
02:32:36,796 --> 02:32:38,703
this going to make you feel better?

1853
02:32:38,703 --> 02:32:46,271
TALIESIN: I don't know what I want. I want to see
them. I want to look at them. I want to see them.

1854
02:32:46,271 --> 02:32:49,212
MARISHA: Do you want to talk to them?

1855
02:32:49,212 --> 02:32:52,127
TALIESIN: No. I want to listen to them.

1856
02:32:52,127 --> 02:32:53,913
TRAVIS: Then we follow your lead.

1857
02:32:53,913 --> 02:32:56,198
TALIESIN: I want to see them. I don't know.

1858
02:32:56,198 --> 02:33:01,905
MARISHA: Do you want us to fucking capture them
and drag them back to the cell that we built in

1859
02:33:01,905 --> 02:33:05,726
our keep? We built it for a reason.

1860
02:33:05,726 --> 02:33:11,182
SAM: (whistles) She gambles now. She's crazy.

1861
02:33:11,182 --> 02:33:13,663
MARISHA: I know, I've been opened up to so many
things.

1862
02:33:13,663 --> 02:33:17,279
TALIESIN: The best I can give you is we'll just
have to see what happens.

1863
02:33:17,279 --> 02:33:26,679
LIAM: Percival, I trust you implicitly. You have
earned that trust. Do you believe them to be evil

1864
02:33:26,679 --> 02:33:28,447
in the purest sense?

1865
02:33:28,447 --> 02:33:29,838
TALIESIN: I do.

1866
02:33:29,838 --> 02:33:32,537
LAURA and LIAM: That's all we need.

1867
02:33:32,537 --> 02:33:36,681
SAM: We don't even need that much. If you'd just
said to kill someone, we'd probably do it.

1868
02:33:36,681 --> 02:33:42,680
TALIESIN: I saw things.

1869
02:33:42,680 --> 02:33:49,156
LAURA: Should we prepare? Let's do it! I've been
training Trinket, though, does that help?

1870
02:33:49,156 --> 02:33:51,275
MARISHA: I've been reading my alchemy books.

1871
02:33:51,275 --> 02:33:53,425
MATT: Six beard checks.

1872
02:33:53,425 --> 02:33:55,478
SAM: I went to get business cards.

1873
02:33:55,478 --> 02:33:59,233
MATT: Right. That'll cost you 25 gold for 100.

1874
02:33:59,233 --> 02:34:04,948
SAM: I'm going to get two sets. One says Scanlan
Shorthalt, one says Burt Reynolds.

1875
02:34:04,948 --> 02:34:07,794
MATT: Okay. Both have been constructed without
question.

1876
02:34:07,794 --> 02:34:10,238
LIAM: I repaid my debt to Gilmore.

1877
02:34:10,238 --> 02:34:12,174
MATT: All right, debt is paid, mark off that
gold.

1878
02:34:12,174 --> 02:34:16,946
LAURA: Yes!

1879
02:34:16,946 --> 02:34:18,786
MATT: How many is that?

1880
02:34:18,786 --> 02:34:32,865
TRAVIS: I'm at five total, right? 46. 45. 55. A
one. And a 95.

1881
02:34:32,865 --> 02:34:43,148
MATT: By the end of this week, you have grown what
is a rather majestic full chin-beard. You are

1882
02:34:43,148 --> 02:34:51,716
probably the first goliath to have facial hair.
It's a full, we're talking Portland man.

1883
02:34:51,716 --> 02:34:54,541
SAM: Oh no.

1884
02:34:54,541 --> 02:35:05,580
LIAM: Another thing that I did was go off and get
a lathering cream, and the second to last night,

1885
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:10,735
after I took Grog out to the tavern, I bought him
a lot of drinks.

1886
02:35:10,735 --> 02:35:12,478
TRAVIS: I assume dodge.

1887
02:35:12,478 --> 02:35:14,048
LIAM: I didn't shave off his whole beard.

1888
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:16,099
Only half of it.

1889
02:35:16,099 --> 02:35:19,130
TRAVIS: I just became the most handsome man in the
world.

1890
02:35:19,130 --> 02:35:21,435
LAURA: Do not shave his fucking beard off.

1891
02:35:21,435 --> 02:35:23,076
LIAM: This much.

1892
02:35:23,076 --> 02:35:34,006
MATT: Make a stealth check. Make a perception
check. You just broke a mechanical pencil!

1893
02:35:34,006 --> 02:35:39,238
(laughter)

1894
02:35:39,347 --> 02:35:46,412
LIAM: DM? I rolled a natural 20. I have advantage
on stealth checks, and I rolled an 18 and a 20.

1895
02:35:46,412 --> 02:35:47,816
Natural 20.

1896
02:35:47,816 --> 02:35:56,776
MATT: Sleeping soundly, drunk, you do not hear the
approach of Vax. As you pull out your blade and

1897
02:35:56,776 --> 02:35:59,781
get ready, I want you to roll a sleight of hand
check.

1898
02:35:59,781 --> 02:36:01,564
LIAM: After the 20?

1899
02:36:01,564 --> 02:36:05,630
MATT: One thing to not be noticed. It's another to
shave someone's face without being noticed. This

1900
02:36:05,630 --> 02:36:08,455
is about stillness of fingers, not just how
stealthy you can be.

1901
02:36:08,455 --> 02:36:14,853
LIAM: I'm using Luck. Okay, so I rolled a 21.

1902
02:36:14,853 --> 02:36:20,210
MATT: Roll a perception check, Grog. With
advantage because this is against your face.

1903
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:25,612
TRAVIS: 13.

1904
02:36:25,612 --> 02:36:27,997
LIAM: 21.

1905
02:36:27,997 --> 02:36:29,435
MATT: All right.

1906
02:36:29,435 --> 02:36:31,503
LAURA: Why are you so evil?

1907
02:36:31,503 --> 02:36:34,492
LIAM: Why did he trip me and make me eat shit two
months ago?

1908
02:36:34,492 --> 02:36:37,186
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and ORION: Oh!

1909
02:36:37,186 --> 02:36:40,316
TRAVIS: Appetizer of things to come, my friend.

1910
02:36:40,316 --> 02:36:47,757
MATT: The crowing sound of a distant rooster. The
farmlands that surround the outside of Emon, which

1911
02:36:47,757 --> 02:36:54,326
are relatively close, within earshot. The morning
sun rises, cresting over the eastern skyline of

1912
02:36:54,326 --> 02:37:02,847
Tal'Dorei. Grog, you come to consciousness,
stretch, reach up to rub-- half a beard.

1913
02:37:02,847 --> 02:37:08,402
TRAVIS: Half a beard? Like, just one side of my
face?

1914
02:37:08,402 --> 02:37:09,946
MATT: One side of your face.

1915
02:37:09,946 --> 02:37:12,493
TRAVIS: I say in a low, guttural growl--

1916
02:37:12,493 --> 02:37:14,314
LIAM: You have no idea it was me.

1917
02:37:14,314 --> 02:37:19,996
TRAVIS: Vax. I didn't have to wake up to know it
was you, motherfucker.

1918
02:37:19,996 --> 02:37:22,845
LIAM: Make an intelligence check! Make him make an
intelligence check!

1919
02:37:22,845 --> 02:37:25,423
MARISHA: We all know it was you.

1920
02:37:25,423 --> 02:37:34,548
TRAVIS: I reach down, I find a dark stone on the
ground, and I go over to the bare side of my face

1921
02:37:34,548 --> 02:37:40,556
and I draw a very beautiful mustache to complete
the other half of it.

1922
02:37:40,556 --> 02:37:43,522
LIAM: He is dumb as a post. Why does he know--

1923
02:37:43,522 --> 02:37:47,998
TRAVIS: Because you're the only fucking idiot
stupid enough to do that!

1924
02:37:47,998 --> 02:37:53,091
LIAM: Magic is mysterious! Why couldn't you grow
half a beard due to magic?

1925
02:37:53,091 --> 02:37:59,017
TRAVIS: Maybe I don't know. Let's say I assume.

1926
02:37:59,017 --> 02:38:03,281
(laughter)

1927
02:38:03,281 --> 02:38:06,415
MATT: However, it is a new morning. Roll a beard
check.

1928
02:38:06,415 --> 02:38:08,523
TRAVIS: Eight, four.

1929
02:38:08,523 --> 02:38:10,086
MATT: No movement.

1930
02:38:10,086 --> 02:38:12,206
LIAM: Sorry, big guy.

1931
02:38:12,206 --> 02:38:21,820
MATT: All right, so as a note, Percy, I want you
to make four more tinkering rolls.

1932
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:23,472
TALIESIN: All right.

1933
02:38:23,472 --> 02:38:27,557
SAM: I'm going to give him inspiration for one of
them.

1934
02:38:27,557 --> 02:38:32,564
(singing) Do you want to build a machine gun?

1935
02:38:32,564 --> 02:38:36,033
TALIESIN: (singing) Why, yes, I really do.

1936
02:38:36,033 --> 02:38:37,544
MATT: What have you got?

1937
02:38:37,544 --> 02:38:39,433
TALIESIN: 28.

1938
02:38:39,433 --> 02:38:42,717
MATT: 28, okay. Second one?

1939
02:38:42,717 --> 02:38:46,181
MARISHA: Oh god.

1940
02:38:46,181 --> 02:38:49,228
MATT: Dice going everywhere.

1941
02:38:49,351 --> 02:38:53,654
SAM: Inspiration, d10.

1942
02:38:53,654 --> 02:38:56,997
TALIESIN: I got a d6 from the last one you did.

1943
02:38:56,997 --> 02:38:59,472
MATT: d6 is what I gave you.

1944
02:38:59,472 --> 02:39:05,704
TALIESIN: d10, so I'll roll a d10 with the next
one. That one was 20.

1945
02:39:05,704 --> 02:39:07,632
MATT: All right. Third one?

1946
02:39:07,632 --> 02:39:11,932
TALIESIN: 28.

1947
02:39:11,932 --> 02:39:18,033
MATT: All right, and the fourth one?

1948
02:39:18,033 --> 02:39:19,342
TALIESIN: 23.

1949
02:39:19,342 --> 02:39:24,917
MATT: Okay, so over the next few days, you've
constructed what amounts to a large, metallic

1950
02:39:24,917 --> 02:39:33,025
gauntlet. You have taken this gauntlet and wired
all through it insulation and metallic insulating

1951
02:39:33,025 --> 02:39:39,563
tips in what is essentially a small, for lack of a
better term, alternator of some kind.

1952
02:39:39,563 --> 02:39:43,450
TALIESIN: I was going to try to sneak in a few
bullets during that time.

1953
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:48,876
MATT: The fifth roll's going to be that. You have
constructed this device. The quality seems fair.

1954
02:39:48,876 --> 02:39:54,909
It's untested technology, just something that's a
brainchild of your own, utilizing Keyleth's aid.

1955
02:39:54,909 --> 02:40:00,007
Keyleth, I'm going to have you roll a wisdom
check. Roll that and add five.

1956
02:40:00,007 --> 02:40:05,045
MARISHA: Well. Add just my base wisdom?

1957
02:40:05,045 --> 02:40:07,353
MATT: Plus six, it would be. Sorry.

1958
02:40:07,353 --> 02:40:09,035
MARISHA: Yes, plus six, so 20 total.

1959
02:40:09,035 --> 02:40:12,509
MATT: 20 total. You step out and you set it down
in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth, you

1960
02:40:12,509 --> 02:40:17,304
summon a storm that slowly gathers above the top
of the keep. You guys start hearing sounds like

1961
02:40:17,304 --> 02:40:20,248
rolling thunder outside and you come and look, and
you see Percy and Keyleth are out standing in the

1962
02:40:20,248 --> 02:40:24,852
middle of the courtyard. Keyleth with her arm in
the air as this black, dark storm cloud begins to

1963
02:40:24,852 --> 02:40:30,823
swirl above the entirety of Greyskull Keep. With
that, she brings her hand up and then brings her

1964
02:40:30,823 --> 02:40:35,075
fist down as a bolt of energy (thunder clap)
streaks down from the clouds, slamming into a

1965
02:40:35,075 --> 02:40:39,292
small object on the ground that then gets flung
about 15 feet in a random direction. Tumbles to

1966
02:40:39,292 --> 02:40:43,106
the ground. You rush over to grab it. You can see
arcing over the metal. (electric sparking) These

1967
02:40:43,106 --> 02:40:48,426
small electric arcs. You reach over and wait a
second. You prod it. Pick it up and it's hot. Drop

1968
02:40:48,426 --> 02:40:52,884
it instinctively. You give it a few minutes to
cool off. Pick it up when it's warm enough; you

1969
02:40:52,884 --> 02:40:59,740
put it on and there is essentially this large,
sparking, metal centerpiece that is giving off

1970
02:40:59,740 --> 02:41:01,218
this low hum.

1971
02:41:01,218 --> 02:41:05,121
MARISHA: Did it work? Try it on Tiberius.

1972
02:41:05,121 --> 02:41:08,731
ORION: Sure. Here.

1973
02:41:08,731 --> 02:41:10,497
TALIESIN: Touch.

1974
02:41:10,497 --> 02:41:15,111
MATT: Okay. Tiberius, make a constitution saving
throw.

1975
02:41:15,111 --> 02:41:19,637
SAM and ORION: No!

1976
02:41:19,637 --> 02:41:22,458
(laughter)

1977
02:41:22,458 --> 02:41:32,544
MATT: All right, you suffer 14 points of lightning
damage and are stunned for a round. I need you to

1978
02:41:32,544 --> 02:41:40,580
go ahead and roll a d20.

1979
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:44,816
TALIESIN: Cock-a-dooed. (yelps)

1980
02:41:44,816 --> 02:41:48,220
MARISHA: High rolls startle him.

1981
02:41:48,220 --> 02:41:49,549
TALIESIN: 19.

1982
02:41:49,549 --> 02:41:56,131
MATT: 19, okay. It stays intact from the force of
it. A little bit of the energy that was stored in

1983
02:41:56,131 --> 02:42:00,837
there appears to dissipate. You figure there's
only a few applications of this before it needs to

1984
02:42:00,837 --> 02:42:08,911
be recharged, and every single time it's utilized,
there's a low chance that it may detonate, or

1985
02:42:08,911 --> 02:42:11,324
crumble, or something bad may happen.

1986
02:42:11,324 --> 02:42:14,792
SAM: Percy, that's amazing! What do you call it?

1987
02:42:14,792 --> 02:42:17,857
ORION: (unintelligible mumbling)

1988
02:42:17,857 --> 02:42:23,119
TALIESIN: Are you all right, Tiberius?

1989
02:42:23,119 --> 02:42:27,754
MARISHA: I go over and give him a Cure Wounds.

1990
02:42:27,754 --> 02:42:32,652
MATT: You manage to eventually shake off all your
muscles that were so locked, tense,

1991
02:42:32,652 --> 02:42:34,199
give way for a second.

1992
02:42:34,199 --> 02:42:35,473
ORION: It's effective.

1993
02:42:35,473 --> 02:42:37,840
MARISHA: That was awesome.

1994
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,252
TALIESIN: I call it Diplomacy.

1995
02:42:39,252 --> 02:42:40,920
SAM: Diplomacy?

1996
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:42,495
LAURA: I like it.

1997
02:42:42,495 --> 02:42:44,751
TRAVIS: That's great.

1998
02:42:44,751 --> 02:42:52,178
LAURA: As we're standing watching that, Trinket
comes <i>rolling</i> into the courtyard!

1999
02:42:52,178 --> 02:42:54,497
MATT: Let's go ahead and make an animal handling
check.

2000
02:42:54,497 --> 02:42:59,915
LAURA: Oh, why didn't I get more points in that?

2001
02:42:59,915 --> 02:43:02,640
LIAM: Roll high. Come on.

2002
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:08,737
MATT: I say with advantage because Trinket's been
your companion for so long.

2003
02:43:08,737 --> 02:43:10,972
LAURA: Natural 20!

2004
02:43:10,972 --> 02:43:17,028
MATT: Which is close to what you needed because
this is a very difficult feat. Over the week

2005
02:43:17,028 --> 02:43:21,959
you've worked with Trinket and you've worked on a
technique where, instead of a multi-attack,

2006
02:43:21,959 --> 02:43:26,796
Trinket can do what is essentially a trample
attack, meaning Trinket can roll forward and roll

2007
02:43:26,796 --> 02:43:30,713
through anything that's equal to or smaller. And
damage everything in that path.

2008
02:43:30,713 --> 02:43:35,146
LIAM: (singing) Circus bear.

2009
02:43:35,146 --> 02:43:40,521
MATT: We'll go over the logistics of that some
other time, but Trinket has now learned a

2010
02:43:40,521 --> 02:43:42,180
roly-poly trample attack.

2011
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:44,383
LAURA: Should we call it the roly-poly or the
cannonball?

2012
02:43:44,383 --> 02:43:45,585
TRAVIS: That's your call.

2013
02:43:45,585 --> 02:43:48,335
MATT: It's your call. Call it what you want.

2014
02:43:48,335 --> 02:43:50,479
LIAM: Roly-poly is cute; cannonball is--

2015
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:52,840
LAURA: I think I like cannonball because it's
better to shout during the battle.

2016
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:54,429
MATT: The Trinket cannonball.

2017
02:43:54,429 --> 02:43:56,687
LIAM: Roly-poly!

2018
02:43:56,687 --> 02:44:03,996
ORION: For brevity, I rolled six dice. I rolled,
the only high ones worth mentioning was a 13, a

2019
02:44:03,996 --> 02:44:05,465
15, and 18.

2020
02:44:05,465 --> 02:44:07,144
MATT: With a 15 and an 18--

2021
02:44:07,144 --> 02:44:08,241
ORION: 17, I mean.

2022
02:44:08,241 --> 02:44:09,165
MATT: Yeah.

2023
02:44:09,165 --> 02:44:15,229
ORION: And the, because they're all negative
three. And I attempted to teach to Lockheed to

2024
02:44:15,229 --> 02:44:20,534
hide and speak and to stay.

2025
02:44:20,534 --> 02:44:25,017
MATT: Okay. To hide and to speak. To stay did not
stick, unfortunately. You had two rolls that were

2026
02:44:25,017 --> 02:44:32,255
high enough to get those two in there though. Hide
and speak. All right. The morning has come to

2027
02:44:32,255 --> 02:44:37,925
fruition. You have a few hours before you're
supposed to arrive at the palace. You have been

2028
02:44:37,925 --> 02:44:41,239
notified that this is a very formal event.

2029
02:44:41,239 --> 02:44:43,916
SAM: We'll need fancy robes.

2030
02:44:43,916 --> 02:44:47,643
LAURA: Oh, we have some formal dresses already.

2031
02:44:47,643 --> 02:44:50,199
MATT: Roll again, please.

2032
02:44:50,199 --> 02:44:52,483
TALIESIN: 23.

2033
02:44:52,483 --> 02:45:00,889
MATT: You manage to construct 20 pieces of
ammunition from 20 units of materials.

2034
02:45:00,889 --> 02:45:03,348
TRAVIS: We have three fancy robes.

2035
02:45:03,348 --> 02:45:07,439
ORION: Oh, and I've picked up my glaive, right?
Two days. It was time to.

2036
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:12,659
MATT: You go back to Karin. You now have 
some kind of a knife-glaive thing.

2037
02:45:12,659 --> 02:45:17,347
ORION: Krull! I'm naming it Krull.

2038
02:45:17,347 --> 02:45:23,225
MATT: You are unsure how it will work in combat?
But it looks neat.

2039
02:45:23,225 --> 02:45:24,814
ORION: And I attach it to my coat.

2040
02:45:24,814 --> 02:45:27,441
MATT: It just hangs to the side. Careful how you
sit.

2041
02:45:27,441 --> 02:45:31,515
LIAM: Do I still have the finery I wore to the
Velvet Cabaret?

2042
02:45:31,515 --> 02:45:33,944
MATT: You would, yes.

2043
02:45:33,944 --> 02:45:36,603
LIAM: All right. So we have to worry about you,
Grog.

2044
02:45:36,603 --> 02:45:40,151
TRAVIS: Are there any tapestries or curtains in
the castle?

2045
02:45:40,151 --> 02:45:41,400
MATT: There are, actually.

2046
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:46,183
TRAVIS: I walk up to the prettiest one and I rip
it down, and I throw it over myself like a toga.

2047
02:45:46,183 --> 02:45:50,014
MARISHA: (laughing) It's pretty good.

2048
02:45:50,014 --> 02:45:55,850
MATT: It, in a "Foreigner in a Foreign Land" kind
of way, could work.

2049
02:45:55,850 --> 02:46:02,399
TRAVIS: And I practice my curtsy. Because I've
seen Vex and Keyleth do it,

2050
02:46:02,399 --> 02:46:04,712
so I think everybody does it.

2051
02:46:04,712 --> 02:46:08,738
ORION: I do it, as well. I don't know what's going
on.

2052
02:46:08,738 --> 02:46:11,299
TALIESIN: I want to see him roll an athletics
check for that.

2053
02:46:11,299 --> 02:46:12,659
LAURA: Tiberius.

2054
02:46:12,659 --> 02:46:13,535
ORION: Yes?

2055
02:46:13,535 --> 02:46:20,697
LAURA: Could you Prestidigitate this thing and
make it look like an actual thing?

2056
02:46:20,697 --> 02:46:22,256
SAM: Not for very long.

2057
02:46:22,256 --> 02:46:23,674
MATT: That's more of an illusion.

2058
02:46:23,674 --> 02:46:25,097
LIAM: You pull the hairs out.

2059
02:46:25,097 --> 02:46:28,506
TRAVIS: What's wrong with this? I'm from a strange
land. My customs are my own.

2060
02:46:28,506 --> 02:46:31,679
SAM: Grog, have you washed yourself in water at
all this week?

2061
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:33,024
TRAVIS: No. It burns.

2062
02:46:33,024 --> 02:46:38,279
ORION I do Prestidigitation immediately to get rid
of some kind of smell that I'm sure is emanating.

2063
02:46:38,279 --> 02:46:41,507
TRAVIS: I freak out running around the room.
(screams)

2064
02:46:41,507 --> 02:46:46,302
ORION: It's not water, Grog. And I keep casting it
on him. It's fine, see. (splash)

2065
02:46:46,302 --> 02:46:47,759
LAURA: You're fine.

2066
02:46:47,759 --> 02:46:52,605
TRAVIS: It must have been that powder you gave me
before. It made me immune.

2067
02:46:52,605 --> 02:47:00,124
LAURA: That's what it was. You're immune. You're
definitely immune to water now. Good job.

2068
02:47:00,124 --> 02:47:06,023
ORION: What's wrong with what you're wearing now?

2069
02:47:06,023 --> 02:47:11,844
LAURA: His toga? He's wearing a toga made out of a
tapestry.

2070
02:47:11,844 --> 02:47:18,428
ORION: Oh, so I'll go and I'll use some of my Dust
of Illusion and I'll (pfft) on what he's wearing

2071
02:47:18,428 --> 02:47:21,374
and shape it into a fancier robe.

2072
02:47:21,374 --> 02:47:28,951
MATT: From a visual standpoint, the robe tapers
and curls around his form, and comes to look like

2073
02:47:28,951 --> 02:47:38,530
a nicer robe. The material looks like it's made of
almost a reddish silk. The actual imagery of the

2074
02:47:38,530 --> 02:47:43,432
tapestry slowly fades and becomes just various
textures and material. From your eyes, it's less

2075
02:47:43,432 --> 02:47:46,824
interesting, but from a presentory standpoint it
could be passable.

2076
02:47:46,824 --> 02:47:52,091
LIAM: Don't forget his exotic facial hair, as
well. That probably lends to the whole package.

2077
02:47:52,091 --> 02:47:55,127
MATT: Yeah, which by the way, you guys do see.
It's half giant beard

2078
02:47:55,127 --> 02:47:57,026
and half scrawled-on charcoal.

2079
02:47:57,026 --> 02:48:03,644
ORION: And I notice this, I go: Oh. Oh, Grog. And
I use a little bit more of Dust of Illusion. I

2080
02:48:03,644 --> 02:48:05,607
wipe it. Smear it on there.

2081
02:48:05,607 --> 02:48:06,686
TRAVIS: I wipe it away!

2082
02:48:06,686 --> 02:48:10,336
ORION: No. Stop! Hey, hey, hey-- I put it on.
Actually, I'm going to take it, and I'm going to

2083
02:48:10,336 --> 02:48:14,017
actually put it in your hand and be like-- put it
on your thumb and be like: I want you to smear

2084
02:48:14,017 --> 02:48:21,230
this where the beard was, and I want you to think
really hard that you want it there. Okay? So put

2085
02:48:21,230 --> 02:48:27,597
it on first. There you go. That's it. And now
think really hard that you want it there.

2086
02:48:27,597 --> 02:48:34,907
MATT: The dust tends to glisten, and where there
was once charcoal outline, a mirror to your once

2087
02:48:34,907 --> 02:48:38,154
beautiful beard continues, full, as if nothing had
happened.

2088
02:48:38,154 --> 02:48:42,465
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I take
out a little goblet, and I pour some ale in it.

2089
02:48:42,483 --> 02:48:46,157
And I walk over to Vax, and I go, here you go.

2090
02:48:46,157 --> 02:48:54,779
LIAM: This looks very good. Thank you, Grog.

2091
02:48:54,779 --> 02:48:57,095
TRAVIS: You're welcome. Would you like some more?

2092
02:48:57,095 --> 02:49:02,174
LIAM: No, I don't want to cloud my thinking before
we go up against the Briarwoods.

2093
02:49:02,174 --> 02:49:07,807
TRAVIS: Probably smart. I'll take that back. I
crush the goblet in my hand.

2094
02:49:07,807 --> 02:49:10,465
MATT: This creaking metal sound. The goblet is now
destroyed.

2095
02:49:10,465 --> 02:49:15,059
TRAVIS: Oh no! What happened?

2096
02:49:15,059 --> 02:49:22,765
MATT: All right, dressed up, you all make your way
to the Cloudtop district as the sun begins to

2097
02:49:22,765 --> 02:49:28,143
bring itself to the other side of the horizon. As
you approach the outside of the Tal'Dorei palace,

2098
02:49:28,143 --> 02:49:34,295
there are general guards set up to accept guests.
They're just there in wait as part of their

2099
02:49:34,295 --> 02:49:39,562
process today. As soon as you arrive and announce
yourselves as having arrived, is there anything

2100
02:49:39,562 --> 02:49:41,047
you want to do to prepare?

2101
02:49:41,047 --> 02:49:43,035
SAM: Well, are you in disguise yet, Percy?

2102
02:49:43,035 --> 02:49:45,808
TALIESIN: Yes, I look like Vax.

2103
02:49:45,808 --> 02:49:46,971
SAM: Cloaked Vax?

2104
02:49:46,971 --> 02:49:48,594
LIAM: Where are we?

2105
02:49:48,594 --> 02:49:51,589
MATT: You guys are nearing the palace right now.

2106
02:49:51,589 --> 02:49:54,004
LIAM: Nearing the palace? Hit me.

2107
02:49:54,004 --> 02:49:59,106
MARISHA: I produce a few flower cummerbunds and
start pinning them on the party.

2108
02:49:59,106 --> 02:50:04,955
LAURA: I go in and put my arm through Percy's arm
to make it seem like we're twins. I go in with

2109
02:50:04,955 --> 02:50:08,232
Percy to make it look like we're the twinsies.

2110
02:50:08,232 --> 02:50:13,933
SAM: I'm going to cast Invisibility on Vax.

2111
02:50:13,933 --> 02:50:21,879
TRAVIS: I hand the Potion of Climbing to Vax and
say, don't die.

2112
02:50:21,879 --> 02:50:23,636
LIAM: No promises.

2113
02:50:23,636 --> 02:50:28,189
SAM: You've got one hour until my Invisibility is
going to wear off, so find a shadow.

2114
02:50:28,189 --> 02:50:34,426
MATT: Do you guys make yourselves known at the
palace front?

2115
02:50:34,426 --> 02:50:36,180
SAM: Yes! We're friends here. Yes.

2116
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:41,234
MATT: As you approach, you make yourselves known.
The guards lead you to the front area of the

2117
02:50:41,234 --> 02:50:49,943
palace. The sun's just starting to hit the distant
side of the water of the Ozmit Sea to the west of

2118
02:50:49,943 --> 02:50:57,618
Emon. As you guys finish talking to the front
guard that you've arrived, Seeker Asum steps out

2119
02:50:57,618 --> 02:51:03,432
of the front of the palace and sees you. "Very
good. Glad you could make it. Please enter. I will

2120
02:51:03,432 --> 02:51:06,182
"wish to speak with you briefly before the event
this evening."

2121
02:51:06,182 --> 02:51:07,608
LAURA: Of course.

2122
02:51:07,608 --> 02:51:09,178
MATT: "Are you missing anyone?"

2123
02:51:09,178 --> 02:51:14,397
LAURA: Oh, yes. Percy wasn't feeling very well. He
ended up staying home.

2124
02:51:14,397 --> 02:51:18,190
MATT: Make a deception check.

2125
02:51:18,190 --> 02:51:25,870
LAURA: 11.

2126
02:51:25,870 --> 02:51:34,440
MATT: "Very well. That's unfortunate. His skills
could have been of use to me. Come inside."

2127
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:40,922
LAURA: I pat Vax's hand-- Percy's hand. What the
fuck. This is creepy.

2128
02:51:40,922 --> 02:51:42,765
TRAVIS: Call him Vaxy.

2129
02:51:42,765 --> 02:51:44,173
LAURA: Vaxy.

2130
02:51:44,173 --> 02:51:48,189
TALIESIN: That will work just fine. Thank you.

2131
02:51:48,189 --> 02:51:52,691
MATT: He leads you into the green meeting room you
guys have had previous council meetings with. It's

2132
02:51:52,691 --> 02:51:57,637
currently empty. He sets the guards to the side
and brings you inside and says, "All right, so if

2133
02:51:57,637 --> 02:52:03,327
"my little birds speak truth, they should be
arriving around dusk, so we probably have no more

2134
02:52:03,327 --> 02:52:10,790
"than 20 minutes before they are here themselves.
If you're not aware, they should be referred to as

2135
02:52:10,790 --> 02:52:16,859
"Lord and Lady Briarwood. Their names: Lord Sylas
Briarwood and Lady Delilah Briarwood."

2136
02:52:16,859 --> 02:52:18,701
MARISHA: Sylas and Delilah?

2137
02:52:18,701 --> 02:52:23,884
(singing) Hey there, Delilah.

2138
02:52:23,884 --> 02:52:31,368
MATT: "This is a political dinner. Please do your
best not to cause a scene during the meal, as I

2139
02:52:31,368 --> 02:52:34,281
"need that time as a distraction to do my own
digging."

2140
02:52:34,281 --> 02:52:35,479
LAURA: Yes.

2141
02:52:35,479 --> 02:52:36,693
MATT: "Vax."

2142
02:52:36,693 --> 02:52:37,946
TALIESIN: Yes?

2143
02:52:37,946 --> 02:52:42,293
MATT: "You're light of step and quick to fade.
Would you wish to join me on this or

2144
02:52:42,293 --> 02:52:43,921
"stay with the dinner party?"

2145
02:52:43,921 --> 02:52:46,427
TALIESIN: I'll stay with the dinner party. I wish
to observe.

2146
02:52:46,427 --> 02:52:48,359
SAM: He also has a bit of a cold.

2147
02:52:48,359 --> 02:52:51,476
TALIESIN: I wish to observe the Briarwoods
myself.

2148
02:52:51,476 --> 02:52:53,869
MATT: Make a deception check.

2149
02:52:53,869 --> 02:52:57,983
TALIESIN: (gritty voice) I wish to observe.

2150
02:52:57,983 --> 02:53:01,373
LIAM: You've got to go more nasal, Taliesin.

2151
02:53:01,373 --> 02:53:03,105
TALIESIN: Yes, nasal.

2152
02:53:03,105 --> 02:53:05,190
ORION: Yes, you need to go down here.

2153
02:53:05,190 --> 02:53:07,201
SAM: Sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard.

2154
02:53:07,201 --> 02:53:12,380
MARISHA: I should have done something about this.

2155
02:53:12,380 --> 02:53:13,769
TALIESIN: Five.

2156
02:53:13,769 --> 02:53:27,592
MATT: Asum goes, "All right. If we are to do this,
I would appreciate a little bit of honesty at the

2157
02:53:27,592 --> 02:53:28,854
"front point."

2158
02:53:28,854 --> 02:53:31,312
ORION: Well, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from
Draconia.

2159
02:53:31,312 --> 02:53:32,660
TALIESIN: It's all right.

2160
02:53:32,660 --> 02:53:36,513
SAM: This is not Vax.

2161
02:53:36,513 --> 02:53:39,930
TALIESIN: Asum, it's me.

2162
02:53:39,930 --> 02:53:45,669
MATT: "I gathered as much, as soon as you began to
speak. Now, I can understand, based on our

2163
02:53:45,669 --> 02:53:50,227
"previous conversation, that you have interest in
keeping low key, but know that I am an ally in

2164
02:53:50,227 --> 02:53:54,488
"this. If you're not here, where is the rest of
your party. Where is Vax?"

2165
02:53:54,488 --> 02:53:56,214
TALIESIN: Vax is here.

2166
02:53:56,214 --> 02:53:58,674
LAURA: He's stealthing.

2167
02:53:58,674 --> 02:54:00,124
TALIESIN: He's being quiet.

2168
02:54:00,124 --> 02:54:09,143
MATT: "Well, Vax, if you can hear me, follow me
when the meal begins. I may have use for you. All

2169
02:54:09,143 --> 02:54:13,982
"right, so. The Briarwoods have a very good
relationship with Uriel and the Tal'Dorei council,

2170
02:54:13,982 --> 02:54:21,614
"established back before they expanded outside of
Wildemount. I've sent two of my best gatherers into

2171
02:54:21,614 --> 02:54:27,162
"Wynandir to seek out more information on them. I
don't know when that information will be

2172
02:54:27,162 --> 02:54:32,633
"available; they've only been gone but three days,
and hopefully in time, we'll learn more of what

"their machinations may be. Many of the noble
houses of Whitestone were left vacant when the de

2174

"Rolos passed and were given to friends of the
Briarwoods. Whispers that reach me speak of these

2175
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:49,381
"new nobles, not being highborn, nor affiliated
with the gentry at all, so I'm curious as to what

2176
02:54:49,381 --> 02:54:53,878
"allies they've made either before or after taking
Whitestone for themselves."

2177
02:54:53,878 --> 02:54:58,270
MARISHA: What are the names of these people who've
taken over White--

2178
02:54:58,270 --> 02:55:00,069
LAURA: It was the Briarwoods.

2179
02:55:00,069 --> 02:55:01,703
MATT: "I don't. The Briarwoods have."

2180
02:55:01,703 --> 02:55:03,628
MARISHA: I thought they said they had friends.

2181
02:55:03,628 --> 02:55:07,109
MATT: "I do not know yet. I've sent folks out
there. Those who have been sent to Whitestone have

2182
02:55:07,109 --> 02:55:13,325
"either defected or quit and sent me letters of
resignation which is part of the reason I am very

2183
02:55:13,325 --> 02:55:20,708
"curious as to what's going on in Whitestone. Now,
I've also found the documentation that delivered

2184
02:55:20,708 --> 02:55:24,823
"the ungoverned lands of Whitestone to the
Briarwoods was signed, officiated and cataloged

2185
02:55:24,823 --> 02:55:31,697
"months in advance to the de Rolo family passing.
I'm still following the trail but I find the

2186
02:55:31,697 --> 02:55:42,517
"timing far too convenient. With their arrival
coming up, please be controlled, remember what

2187
02:55:42,517 --> 02:55:45,894
"I've told you and as more information comes in in
the passing weeks I'll bring that to your

2188
02:55:45,894 --> 02:55:53,010
"attention, as well. Be observant, listen, pry what
information you can, but do not raise suspicion."

2189
02:55:53,010 --> 02:56:02,047
SAM: We will be as quiet as a house mouse.
However, if you need us to act, just utter the

2190
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:03,363
word "jenga."

2191
02:56:03,363 --> 02:56:04,973
MATT: "Jenga."

2192
02:56:04,973 --> 02:56:12,613
MARISHA: I also make a matching corsage and pin it
on his lapel, as well.

2193
02:56:12,613 --> 02:56:16,407
MATT: As you do, he looks down at it and goes,
"Thank you; it's not my color."

2194
02:56:16,407 --> 02:56:20,847
MARISHA: You know, that's fine.

2195
02:56:20,847 --> 02:56:28,689
MATT: "I appreciate the offer but my theme goes
with browns and blacks so as not to be seen. This

2196
02:56:28,689 --> 02:56:30,026
"is a bit bright for my taste."

2197
02:56:30,026 --> 02:56:32,288
MARISHA: It might have had a more utilitarian
purpose, but it's fine.

2198
02:56:32,288 --> 02:56:35,264
MATT: "I'm not going to be at the dinner, but
thank you."

2199
02:56:35,264 --> 02:56:44,997
LAURA: Do you have any of your people learning
about the Briarwoods? Are they magic users in any

2200
02:56:44,997 --> 02:56:47,880
way? Have you heard anything?

2201
02:56:47,880 --> 02:56:52,860
MATT: "The only thing I can recall as the
information of the Briarwoods, at least what's

2202
02:56:52,860 --> 02:57:00,434
"come this way was while they were ruling the lands
in Wildemount as part of their kingdom there, Lady

2203
02:57:00,434 --> 02:57:08,254
"Delilah Briarwood was an accomplished practitioner
of the arcane arts, a long-trained wizard as far

2204
02:57:08,254 --> 02:57:11,805
"as I know and been through quite a few different
schools and had a brief stint here in Emon

2205
02:57:11,805 --> 02:57:18,584
"training at the Lyceum, but that was naught but nine,
ten years back? Maybe more."

2206
02:57:18,584 --> 02:57:24,080
LAURA: Do any of you know, as somebody practiced
in the arcane arts, are you good at seeing through

2207
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:25,921
illusions? Or--

2208
02:57:25,921 --> 02:57:28,030
SAM: Who, me? Who, us?

2209
02:57:28,030 --> 02:57:31,088
LAURA: Anybody that is, you know, very skilled?

2210
02:57:31,178 --> 02:57:33,786
ORION: (chuckles) Of course. I just need to know
that one's happening.

2211
02:57:33,786 --> 02:57:38,032
So it's tricky, is what I'm saying.

2212
02:57:38,032 --> 02:57:41,820
LAURA: So she wouldn't automatically know. They
wouldn't be able to spot

2213
02:57:41,820 --> 02:57:44,174
immediately that Percy is not actually--

2214
02:57:44,174 --> 02:57:51,059
ORION: Somebody would have to have rather powerful
abilities to see through an illusion spell like

2215
02:57:51,059 --> 02:58:00,000
a disguise or such. It's like a rakshasa
could see though that kind of thing, per

2216
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:06,336
experience. I doubt that the Briarwoods have
any--

2217
02:58:06,336 --> 02:58:12,719
MATT: At which point you hear, muffled in the
distance a (horn noise) this horn sound that seems

2218
02:58:12,719 --> 02:58:20,892
to be blown as a notification that the arrival of
guests has rolled in.

2219
02:58:20,892 --> 02:58:22,889
TRAVIS: Are you ready for this, Vaxy?

2220
02:58:22,889 --> 02:58:25,384
TALIESIN: No. Let's do this.

2221
02:58:25,384 --> 02:58:27,623
ORION: Would you like me to cast Fireball?

2222
02:58:27,623 --> 02:58:36,697
MATT: Asum goes, "No, please, none of that. Vax,
if you can hear me in this room, ten minutes into

2223
02:58:36,697 --> 02:58:43,843
"the meal see if you can spot me and follow me in
the foyer. Good luck."

2224
02:58:43,843 --> 02:58:46,177
LAURA: Great.

2225
02:58:46,177 --> 02:58:50,694
SAM: Keyleth, I hope you phoned ahead and gave
them your order for a vegan meal.

2226
02:58:50,694 --> 02:58:52,328
MARISHA: Oh, I always do.

2227
02:58:52,328 --> 02:58:57,502
TALIESIN: She's vegan. Of course she told them.

2228
02:58:57,502 --> 02:58:59,450
MARISHA: Exactly. It's on the RSVP.

2229
02:58:59,450 --> 02:59:04,799
MATT: Asum leaves the room. Do you wish to stay
inside,

2230
02:59:04,799 --> 02:59:06,964
do you wish to see the guests as they arrive?

2231
02:59:06,964 --> 02:59:09,058
TALIESIN: Let's go be social.

2232
02:59:09,058 --> 02:59:10,516
SAM: Let's go mingle.

2233
02:59:10,516 --> 02:59:15,264
MATT: All right. You guys head back out to the
front of the palace, the large stairway that leads

2234
02:59:15,264 --> 02:59:19,844
down into the central road outside of the palace
in the middle of the Cloudtop district. The sky

2235
02:59:19,844 --> 02:59:24,612
itself has now come to a dark purple blue slowly
moving over into the distant sunset. The sun has

2236
02:59:24,612 --> 02:59:32,877
disappeared beneath the sea and you've completed
the dusk as the sunset slowly turns gold. A dark

2237
02:59:32,877 --> 02:59:36,973
wood carriage flanked by four armored men on
horseback pulls onto the road right before the

2238
02:59:36,973 --> 02:59:42,248
Tal'Dorei palace. A young man steps from the front
of the carriage and opens the door. Stepping out

2239
02:59:42,248 --> 02:59:50,101
you see a strong, tall man in the nearby lantern
light. Short brown hair frames a very chiseled and

2240
02:59:50,101 --> 02:59:55,849
handsome face adorned with a well groomed goatee.
His clothing is based in blue and black, fitted

2241
02:59:55,849 --> 03:00:01,005
elegance trimmed with golds and red. A strip of
grey fur cresting over one shoulder framing his

2242
03:00:01,005 --> 03:00:09,552
torso. He turns, extends his hand towards the
door, where a feminine gloved hand finds it. A

2243
03:00:09,552 --> 03:00:14,144
beautiful woman steps out after. Her hair dark
auburn and pulled up into a tight braided bun,

2244
03:00:14,144 --> 03:00:19,610
resembling some sort of a glamorous school teacher
almost. Her gown is in the same color scheme as

2245
03:00:19,610 --> 03:00:25,597
the man, if a bit heavier blue than black, and a
long billowing skirt tapers up to be form-fitted

2246
03:00:25,597 --> 03:00:32,094
across her body, continuing upward to wrap her neck
nearly to the jaw. They both turn to face the

2247
03:00:32,094 --> 03:00:37,330
greeting party, bowing slightly as two of their
companion guards flank their approach up the

2248
03:00:37,330 --> 03:00:42,770
steps. The other two helping the young man who
steered the carriage carry their rather large bags

2249
03:00:42,770 --> 03:00:58,707
behind them. This is Lord Sylas Briarwood and Lady
Delilah Briarwood. As you guys are standing here

2250
03:00:58,707 --> 03:01:03,939
at this point, stepping behind you a hand reaches
over and touches the back of your shoulder. You

2251
03:01:03,939 --> 03:01:11,211
look behind you and there, smiling, is Arcanist
Allura Vysoren dressed in a very fine blue gown.

2252
03:01:11,211 --> 03:01:16,073
You've never seen her quite so formal, but very
beautiful type thing. She glances over the

2253
03:01:16,073 --> 03:01:19,722
shoulders, "It's so good to see you. I'm so glad
you all could make it."

2254
03:01:19,722 --> 03:01:22,151
LAURA: So wonderful to see you. I give her a hug.

2255
03:01:22,151 --> 03:01:34,344
MATT: She gives a little hug, too. Glances over at
you. "A pleasure, Vax'ildan."

2256
03:01:34,344 --> 03:01:36,452
ORION: See? She can see it.

2257
03:01:36,452 --> 03:01:38,500
MARISHA: Yes, she can.

2258
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:47,356
MATT: What are you doing?

2259
03:01:47,356 --> 03:01:52,140
ORION: You look gorgeous Allura, and my friends
are just making weird faces right now. It's

2260
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:55,120
probably because of how beautiful you look.

2261
03:01:55,120 --> 03:02:00,885
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion about
15 feet from you the Briarwoods enter the palace,

2262
03:02:00,885 --> 03:02:09,987
their guards enter with them. There's been no
pleasantry and very much an intended arrival. None

2263
03:02:09,987 --> 03:02:13,008
of you are recognizable to them, thus they make no
intent of introducing themselves.

2264
03:02:13,008 --> 03:02:14,911
LAURA: We catch any of their eye at all?

2265
03:02:14,911 --> 03:02:19,541
MATT: They appear to be looking about and taking
in their surroundings but they're both engaged in

2266
03:02:19,541 --> 03:02:22,019
a mumbled conversation between the two of them as
they enter.

2267
03:02:22,019 --> 03:02:23,569
MARISHA: Is anyone waiting to greet them?

2268
03:02:23,569 --> 03:02:32,724
MATT: As you follow where they're going, as you
walk into the main foyer area where you stand

2269
03:02:32,724 --> 03:02:38,357
there, waiting carefully at the back, there are a
number of servants that have arrived and have

2270
03:02:38,357 --> 03:02:43,758
taken some of their bags and help them up the
stairs. There is one, the head servant who is

2271
03:02:43,758 --> 03:02:49,023
there talking to them and you hear him speaking to
them. "Wait in your quarters be ready, the meal

2272
03:02:49,023 --> 03:02:52,500
"should be ready within the hour. If you would be
so kind as to prepare yourselves, relax, unwind,

2273
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:58,327
"set up your rooms. You're to stay for a few days
at the very least. But we shall call you when the

2274
03:02:58,327 --> 03:03:04,130
"meal is ready." At which Lord Sylas Briarwood
turns to him and says, "I greatly appreciate the

2275
03:03:04,130 --> 03:03:08,946
"information. Just come to our room and let us know
when the food is ready. Now, come, my dear"

2276
03:03:08,946 --> 03:03:14,795
LAURA: Can I keep an eye on them as they're
walking to their room? Just as long as I can see

2277
03:03:14,795 --> 03:03:17,574
their mouths moving, I can read their lips.

2278
03:03:17,574 --> 03:03:20,961
TALIESIN: I also want to scan their entourage to
see if I recognize any faces.

2279
03:03:20,961 --> 03:03:24,475
MATT: Okay, perception check. Perception check for
you, as well.

2280
03:03:24,475 --> 03:03:29,137
LAURA: Do I have to perceive it? I have a feat
that I can read it.

2281
03:03:29,137 --> 03:03:30,322
MATT: Oh, you do?

2282
03:03:30,322 --> 03:03:35,569
LAURA: Yeah, I have Observant: Read Lips meaning I
can read lips from any language I can understand.

2283
03:03:35,569 --> 03:03:36,810
MATT: That's true. Okay, good to know.

2284
03:03:36,810 --> 03:03:38,060
TALIESIN: 19.

2285
03:03:38,060 --> 03:03:43,420
MATT: 19. No, they all appear to be run of the
mill soldiers, nothing, no one that catches your

2286
03:03:43,420 --> 03:03:51,539
attention. The young man who is helping them as
they go through seems familiar, but no one that is

2287
03:03:51,539 --> 03:03:57,106
jumping out at you right now. Someone you may have
crossed paths with in the past but nobody that's

2288
03:03:57,106 --> 03:04:02,015
really been formally involved in your life
previously. Maybe a denizen of Whitestone that

2289
03:04:02,015 --> 03:04:07,365
you've crossed before when he was younger. As they
walk up the steps, you keep an eye best you can as

2290
03:04:07,365 --> 03:04:12,577
they go. You catch a little bit of conversation
that seems to speak about how long the journey's

2291
03:04:12,577 --> 03:04:18,221
been, "That's all right, we'll be in there soon to
discuss and we'll be out as soon as we can. We

2292
03:04:18,221 --> 03:04:21,606
"won't stay any longer than we need to." And that's
the extent you gather as they continue up the

2293
03:04:21,606 --> 03:04:27,957
stairway. As the next hour or so passes?

2294
03:04:27,957 --> 03:04:30,396
ORION: I flirt with Allura.

2295
03:04:30,396 --> 03:04:32,775
MATT: Okay, do you want to talk with Allura?

2296
03:04:32,775 --> 03:04:35,437
ORION: I flirt with her throughout the hour.

2297
03:04:35,437 --> 03:04:42,493
MATT: Okay, she's grateful for the conversation.
She laughs, and she's very attentive to all of you

2298
03:04:42,493 --> 03:04:47,253
and excited to see you. She lets you know that
she's been caught in a little bit of the

2299
03:04:47,253 --> 03:04:51,907
bureaucracy in the city and despises that. She's
taken some time off for herself

2300
03:04:51,907 --> 03:04:53,682
for about a week or so.

2301
03:04:53,682 --> 03:04:56,036
ORION: Actually, towards the end of that
conversation I would like to bring up a specific

2302
03:04:56,036 --> 03:04:59,068
thing. We've been having such a wonderful
conversation.

2303
03:04:59,068 --> 03:05:01,188
MATT: "Of course, no, of course, Tiberius"

2304
03:05:01,188 --> 03:05:07,829
ORION: I think when things settle down a bit,
perhaps you and I and maybe Grog, and Lady Kima

2305
03:05:07,829 --> 03:05:17,653
can perhaps go out. Break bread and have some wine
and such on an evening with each other. I believe

2306
03:05:17,653 --> 03:05:22,751
my friend rather fancies Kima. What say you?

2307
03:05:22,751 --> 03:05:35,886
MATT: "Well, that's very flattering, Tiberius. I
appreciate the invitation. I would say that

2308
03:05:35,886 --> 03:05:39,122
"particular mix of company might prove a bit
awkward."

2309
03:05:39,122 --> 03:05:48,775
ORION: Well, of course. If it was awkward, nobody
wants that.

2310
03:05:48,775 --> 03:05:51,412
MATT: "Perhaps we might-- I mean if you would like
to get some tea sometime

2311
03:05:51,412 --> 03:05:52,702
"I'd be more than happy to--"

2312
03:05:52,702 --> 03:05:54,253
ORION: Oh, just you and I?

2313
03:05:54,253 --> 03:05:59,901
MATT: "Yes. Kima's quite a ways off and I believe
she's still in Vasselheim, last I spoke with her,

2314
03:05:59,901 --> 03:06:04,920
"and yes, tea would be lovely."

2315
03:06:04,920 --> 03:06:09,307
ORION: Okay, all right, wonderful.

2316
03:06:09,307 --> 03:06:11,653
SAM: You walk away.

2317
03:06:11,653 --> 03:06:13,215
ORION: I walk away.

2318
03:06:13,215 --> 03:06:18,084
(laughter)

2319
03:06:18,084 --> 03:06:20,058
MARISHA: He got a date!

2320
03:06:20,058 --> 03:06:22,954
TRAVIS: Is that carriage. Is the carriage still
there?

2321
03:06:22,954 --> 03:06:27,273
MATT: The carriage, as far as you see, is being
led off slowly by the

2322
03:06:27,273 --> 03:06:30,512
servants to a side area of the palace.

2323
03:06:30,512 --> 03:06:35,773
TRAVIS: And the armed on horseback that were with
the Briarwoods when they came in?

2324
03:06:35,773 --> 03:06:41,038
MATT: Two of them are with the Briarwoods, and
there are two helping

2325
03:06:41,038 --> 03:06:43,318
to bring their stuff up to their rooms.

2326
03:06:43,318 --> 03:06:45,008
TRAVIS: The four are with them?

2327
03:06:45,008 --> 03:06:46,717
MATT: The four are with them, yes.

2328
03:06:46,717 --> 03:06:57,805
SAM: I jump up and give him a little high five.
Then, as an hour has passed, I beckon to Vax and

2329
03:06:57,805 --> 03:06:59,947
find a shadowy area.

2330
03:06:59,947 --> 03:07:01,526
TRAVIS: Real Vax or Vaxy?

2331
03:07:01,526 --> 03:07:07,577
SAM: Real Vax. Because my thing is wearing off,
buddy.

2332
03:07:07,577 --> 03:07:13,789
MARISHA: I've been scanning the crowd. Have I
noticed anything over the past hour of any of our

2333
03:07:13,789 --> 03:07:19,515
people? Any locals, any council members, who may
be acting a little shifty?

2334
03:07:19,515 --> 03:07:25,248
MATT: Looking about, the council is roughly
stepping in and out of the area like they're

2335
03:07:25,248 --> 03:07:28,461
getting ready for the dinner and arriving from the
Cloudtop district.

2336
03:07:28,461 --> 03:07:32,810
MARISHA: Any of them breaking a sweat? Acting
weird?

2337
03:07:32,810 --> 03:07:35,260
LAURA: Yeah. I want to check out this, too.

2338
03:07:35,260 --> 03:07:38,958
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight roll, both of
you guys.

2339
03:07:38,958 --> 03:07:43,366
MARISHA: 22.

2340
03:07:43,366 --> 03:07:49,247
LAURA: 23.

2341
03:07:49,247 --> 03:07:56,472
MATT: The two of you scanning over. Looking over
there is Lord Riskel Daxio, he's an elven male,

2342
03:07:56,472 --> 03:08:00,991
who was the one who is master of trade of the
city. He's the one that handled the ordering of

2343
03:08:00,991 --> 03:08:10,002
your keep when you first had it brought to your
attention by Uriel. Allura, of course. Tofor

2344
03:08:10,002 --> 03:08:17,492
Brotorus is there, the female dragonborn paladin.
She seems generally just not happy about the whole

2345
03:08:17,492 --> 03:08:25,314
scenario and she's not armored, she's dressed in
what would be considered formal attire but it's

2346
03:08:25,314 --> 03:08:34,105
not a dress, it's not a suit, it's this asexual
formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like

2347
03:08:34,105 --> 03:08:39,256
a suit and she does not look to be happy in it at
all. Just arms crossed, at the far end, back

2348
03:08:39,256 --> 03:08:46,110
against the wall just (growling noises) slowly
stewing, not wanting to be there. You also see

2349
03:08:46,110 --> 03:08:51,852
Arbiter Brom Goldhand, who is the master of law.
Was previously one of the heads of the guard there

2350
03:08:51,852 --> 03:08:58,124
within Emon and then was then given the job of
being the head of the Watchful Hall. He's the

2351
03:08:58,124 --> 03:09:07,868
master of law essentially in the city. That's
right, Tofor is the master of defense that took

2352
03:09:07,868 --> 03:09:12,351
over for Krieg after Krieg was slain. So those are
the council members. Most everyone else there you

2353
03:09:12,351 --> 03:09:17,878
see are servants. As time goes on eventually there
is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway

2354
03:09:17,878 --> 03:09:24,992
and everyone turns their head and notices and
steps over to the great hall of the palace where

2355
03:09:24,992 --> 03:09:29,204
the feast is to be given to you and other guests.

2356
03:09:29,204 --> 03:09:34,994
SAM: As we move, I release and then recast
Invisibility on him when I see that there's a

2357
03:09:34,994 --> 03:09:37,321
moment where everyone's distracted.

2358
03:09:37,321 --> 03:09:40,584
MATT: All righty, so you rejuvenate the
Invisibility spell.

2359
03:09:40,584 --> 03:09:43,763
MARISHA: Oh look, Tiberius, they have bananas!

2360
03:09:43,763 --> 03:09:45,197
ORION: Oh!

2361
03:09:45,197 --> 03:09:50,474
LAURA: I can sense you, you dick.

2362
03:09:50,474 --> 03:09:59,724
MATT: You're escorted to the hall by Allura. She
keeps chatting with you guys and asking questions

2363
03:09:59,724 --> 03:10:06,667
about how Vasselheim was, and is Kima well? She
stayed back there. She asks questions about why

2364
03:10:06,667 --> 03:10:09,727
Pike isn't here and you tell her the story that
she stayed behind and everything. You make your

2365
03:10:09,727 --> 03:10:15,514
way into the great hall which seats a vast number
of people. There are five major tables meant for

2366
03:10:15,514 --> 03:10:20,214
like large feasts but there is one central square
table in the far end that is by this giant hearth.

2367
03:10:20,214 --> 03:10:27,106
This fireplace is probably a good six feet high
and about 12 feet wide. It's a grandiose visual on

2368
03:10:27,106 --> 03:10:32,027
the far end of this hall, and there's a long table
right there set for about 20 people. You don't

2369
03:10:32,027 --> 03:10:36,310
know if there will be that many there at the table
but it can seat that many. At which point, all the

2370
03:10:36,310 --> 03:10:41,317
different members of the council have their seats
around it. You guys find your seats.

2371
03:10:41,317 --> 03:10:43,784
LAURA: Can we get a feel for where the Briarwoods
are going to sit?

2372
03:10:43,784 --> 03:10:48,318
MATT: With this many seats set, it's hard to tell,
but you gather

2373
03:10:48,318 --> 03:10:50,203
that they're probably going to sit--

2374
03:10:50,203 --> 03:10:52,557
LAURA: Are there place cards? (laughs)

2375
03:10:52,557 --> 03:10:54,490
MATT: There are no place cards but there are two
ends of the table

2376
03:10:54,490 --> 03:10:56,749
that have two chairs at each end.

2377
03:10:56,749 --> 03:11:03,284
LAURA: Okay. Can I position myself when I sit to
where I can see them?

2378
03:11:03,284 --> 03:11:07,521
So I can read their mouths, specifically.

2379
03:11:07,521 --> 03:11:10,522
MATT: Certainly. You can probably sit on the
center or the far end of the table looking in

2380
03:11:10,522 --> 03:11:12,147
their direction, should be fine.

2381
03:11:12,147 --> 03:11:15,875
ORION: Can I sit at the far end of the table at
the very opposite end,

2382
03:11:15,875 --> 03:11:17,802
if not at head of the end--

2383
03:11:17,802 --> 03:11:20,117
LAURA: That's probably where Uriel is going to
sit.

2384
03:11:20,117 --> 03:11:21,611
ORION: Oh. Who?

2385
03:11:21,611 --> 03:11:22,690
TRAVIS: The king.

2386
03:11:22,690 --> 03:11:24,007
ORION: Oh! Not that chair.

2387
03:11:24,007 --> 03:11:25,387
MATT: Okay, but adjacent to it?

2388
03:11:25,387 --> 03:11:27,360
ORION: Yes. That would be rude, I think.

2389
03:11:27,360 --> 03:11:28,469
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

2390
03:11:28,469 --> 03:11:32,211
SAM: I assume I sit at the kiddie table because
I'm so tiny?

2391
03:11:32,211 --> 03:11:33,907
LAURA: They've got a booster chair for you,
Scanlan.

2392
03:11:33,907 --> 03:11:41,869
MATT: They do have adjustments for gnomish
guests-- is a way of putting it. All right, after

2393
03:11:41,869 --> 03:11:51,344
you guys sit for a few moments, another servant
steps forward and says, "Please, if we might rise

2394
03:11:51,344 --> 03:11:54,343
"for our guests Lord and Lady Briarwood to join us
at the table--"

2395
03:11:54,343 --> 03:11:58,363
SAM: I am risen already. I'm standing already.

2396
03:11:58,363 --> 03:12:05,875
MATT: Lord and Lady Briarwood now enter arm in
arm, slowly walking from the far end of the great

2397
03:12:05,875 --> 03:12:10,881
hall. They make their way to one end of the table.
They both wordlessly sit down, smiling and

2398
03:12:10,881 --> 03:12:16,719
acknowledge everyone at the table. There's a
moment of silence and then another servant says

2399
03:12:16,719 --> 03:12:26,848
"And would all please attention be given to our
sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the second and the

2400
03:12:26,848 --> 03:12:32,796
"Empress Salda Tal'Dorei." At which point, the
sovereign and his wife enter from the same

2401
03:12:32,796 --> 03:12:36,834
entrance point. Everyone stands up from their
chair, waits for them to get to the edge of the

2402
03:12:36,834 --> 03:12:41,967
table, at which point they nod their head. Everyone
gives a low bow. You guys follow suit, following

2403
03:12:41,967 --> 03:12:45,290
the social graces you're not familiar with but
trying to learn as you go. Except for Tiberius,

2404
03:12:45,290 --> 03:12:53,638
you know this deal. You all follow his lead on
this. Eventually, everyone sits down again. Tables

2405
03:12:53,638 --> 03:12:58,045
are pushed in by servants behind you, you're like
'oh' caught off guard by the whole experience.

2406
03:12:58,045 --> 03:13:07,551
Uriel looks about the table with a smile, shoulder
length brown hair and his chin goatee very well

2407
03:13:07,551 --> 03:13:15,144
crafted into almost a point now. He looks about
the table. "Thank you, Lord and Lady Briarwood,

2408
03:13:15,144 --> 03:13:21,819
"for making the journey across the lands so that we
might meet in person, finally. Please, allow me to

2409
03:13:21,819 --> 03:13:28,642
"introduce our dining party and esteemed council of
Tal'Dorei." He goes around the table introducing,

2410
03:13:28,642 --> 03:13:34,341
"Arbiter Brom Goldhand. He is the master of law of
our city, and is responsible for maintaining all

2411
03:13:34,341 --> 03:13:44,363
"of these grand people of our fair town in the
realm of safety and order. We have Lord Riskel

2412
03:13:44,363 --> 03:13:50,450
"Daxio. He is our head of planning and
construction; has overseen many of the expansions

2413
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:58,615
"of the city, and is a trusted friend of mine. We
have the Arcanist Allura Vysoren: one of my

2414
03:13:58,615 --> 03:14:05,805
"trusted advisors, one of the greatest arcane minds
of all of Tal'Dorei, and the overseer of all

2415
03:14:05,805 --> 03:14:14,763
"things arcane within our city. We have the
Guardian Tofor Brotorus, a fierce warrior and

2416
03:14:14,763 --> 03:14:23,985
"currently the master of defense in our city and
hopefully for a long time to come." Tofor gives a

2417
03:14:23,985 --> 03:14:32,964
(scoffs) sound and everyone is put off by it, but
they're also seemingly used to it. "Arbiter Brom

2418
03:14:32,964 --> 03:14:42,076
"Goldhand: master of law. My lovely wife, the
Empress Salda. We have here within our midst, as

2419
03:14:42,076 --> 03:14:50,521
"well: Vox Machina, a team of intrepid adventurers
who rose up and saved my family's life and very

2420
03:14:50,521 --> 03:14:57,824
"well the city of Emon and have since proven very
useful to our territory. Grog Strongjaw, a goliath

2421
03:14:57,824 --> 03:15:10,562
"of interesting dress, but strong of heart and
blade. We have Vex'halia, half-elven maiden with a

2422
03:15:10,562 --> 03:15:23,025
"bow as swift as the fastest eagle." Looking next,
he says, "We have here Vax'ildan, blades quick and

2423
03:15:23,025 --> 03:15:34,607
"eyes sharp, not a whisper passes his ear. Ah!
There you are! Scanlan Shorthalt, a performer

2424
03:15:34,607 --> 03:15:40,731
"known far and wide. A wit as clever as you've ever
seen. His songs are whispered through taverns

2425
03:15:40,731 --> 03:15:45,762
"across the land. We have Tiberius Stormwind--"

2426
03:15:45,762 --> 03:15:47,452
ORION: I'm from Draconia.

2427
03:15:47,452 --> 03:15:56,943
MATT: "Hailing from Draconia, which," he looks
across to the Briarwoods, "the kingdom you hail

2428
03:15:56,943 --> 03:16:00,313
"from originally not being far off from Draconia,
perhaps you've had some

2429
03:16:00,313 --> 03:16:02,066
"dealings with the Stormwinds?"

2430
03:16:02,066 --> 03:16:07,529
And the Briarwoods give a nod. "Yes, we have seen
them in the past. We've heard many good things."

2431
03:16:07,529 --> 03:16:09,994
ORION: We're pretty cool.

2432
03:16:09,994 --> 03:16:20,780
MATT: "We have over here, Keyleth of the Ashari,
if I am correct on that? She is a denizen of the

2433
03:16:20,780 --> 03:16:26,224
"natural lands and protector of all things nature
within Tal'Dorei."

2434
03:16:26,224 --> 03:16:28,617
MARISHA: Hi.

2435
03:16:28,617 --> 03:16:31,013
MATT: "There was one more."

2436
03:16:31,013 --> 03:16:33,610
TALIESIN: Two, and they could not be in
attendance.

2437
03:16:33,610 --> 03:16:34,960
LAURA: Yes, ill.

2438
03:16:34,960 --> 03:16:39,954
ORION: They were running around. They got
diarrhea. Isn't that what you said?

2439
03:16:39,954 --> 03:16:41,624
SAM: Yes.

2440
03:16:41,624 --> 03:16:53,489
MATT: "Anyway. Welcome, and thank you." He reaches
over and takes a small glass and clinks it with

2441
03:16:53,489 --> 03:16:56,825
his silverware, the servants immediately muster up
and start pulling glasses out and pouring wine

2442
03:16:56,825 --> 03:17:01,308
into everyone's glasses and the conversation
begins to naturally bustle about for this meal.

2443
03:17:01,308 --> 03:17:09,501
Immediately conversation builds in about Uriel
talking across to the Briarwoods talking about the

2444
03:17:09,501 --> 03:17:15,604
bridge. He says "Now, the Uriel bridge, I don't
think the name was necessary, but it's appreciated

2445
03:17:15,604 --> 03:17:23,106
"from my perspective. Now in this union between
Wildemount and Tal'Dorei-- do we have a confirmed

2446
03:17:23,106 --> 03:17:24,672
"trade route between the two?"

2447
03:17:24,672 --> 03:17:30,028
At which Lord Briarwood returns, "This is indeed
very true. We are hoping that through this

2448
03:17:30,028 --> 03:17:37,666
"passageway, we'd have means of rather quick trade
between this kingdom and yours. Not to mention

2449
03:17:37,666 --> 03:17:46,007
"this would allow for individuals to travel for
carried parcels very quickly and we're hoping to

2450
03:17:46,007 --> 03:17:51,898
"establish perhaps a very quick means of
communication outside of the arcane for those who

2451
03:17:51,898 --> 03:17:54,258
"cannot afford these various luxuries."

2452
03:17:54,258 --> 03:18:03,577
Lady Briarwood taps on his shoulder and says, "Yes,
and by the way, I don't mean to bring up a sore

2453
03:18:03,577 --> 03:18:07,283
"subject but it's come to our attention that
apparently last Winter's Crest, there was an

2454
03:18:07,283 --> 03:18:15,745
"attempt on your life," and the table gets a little
quiet for a second. "We're sorry to hear that and

2455
03:18:15,745 --> 03:18:17,280
"wish to express our--"

2456
03:18:17,280 --> 03:18:23,381
Uriel puts his hand out and says, "No, no, it's
quite all right. It was but a paltry attempt, and

2457
03:18:23,381 --> 03:18:31,393
"it was thwarted actually by Vox Machina. They have
been tremendous in keeping us safe and I greatly

2458
03:18:31,393 --> 03:18:34,880
"appreciate their aid in overseeing my family's
good fortune." Yes?

2459
03:18:34,880 --> 03:18:45,681
LIAM: While all this is going on, can you
describe. Are the Briarwood couple together,

2460
03:18:45,681 --> 03:18:46,857
seated next to each other?

2461
03:18:46,857 --> 03:18:49,888
MATT: They are seated right next to each other at
the head of one table across the way.

2462
03:18:49,888 --> 03:18:54,184
LIAM: I intend to be behind them, but what's
behind them, like?

2463
03:18:54,184 --> 03:18:57,377
MATT: What's behind them is just open space and
servants. There's probably a good 25 servants here

2464
03:18:57,377 --> 03:19:00,175
that are just like sitting there patiently, lying
in wait for--

2465
03:19:00,175 --> 03:19:06,088
LIAM: And behind the servants is a wall so there's
lots of open busy crowded space? Okay.

2466
03:19:06,088 --> 03:19:09,772
MATT: And tables. There's like other unused tables
in this great hall that are just out there.

2467
03:19:09,772 --> 03:19:11,104
Four other ones.

2468
03:19:11,104 --> 03:19:19,362
LIAM: All right. I'm going to drink the potion of
climbing that Grog gave me, and I'm spidering up

2469
03:19:19,362 --> 03:19:29,532
the wall and I'd love, while listening to all this
to make an insight check on them just as they

2470
03:19:29,532 --> 03:19:31,508
talk, just for funsies.

2471
03:19:31,508 --> 03:19:33,173
MATT: To inquire about--?

2472
03:19:33,173 --> 03:19:36,392
LIAM: Just to see if they seem like sacks of
shit.

2473
03:19:36,392 --> 03:19:37,954
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2474
03:19:37,954 --> 03:19:47,250
LIAM: Luck, oh not that lucky. This is going to be
very low. Yeah, never mind, low. Very low.

2475
03:19:47,250 --> 03:19:53,601
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance really
at all. They're very charming. You were expecting

2476
03:19:53,601 --> 03:20:02,280
this very dour, dark, evil couple from all the
conversation, but they seem nice. They seem

2477
03:20:02,280 --> 03:20:07,082
earnest. They keep to themselves definitely,
they're definitely a very tight couple but nothing

2478
03:20:07,082 --> 03:20:12,843
about them catches you off guard as being anything
instinctively twisted.

2479
03:20:12,843 --> 03:20:15,833
LIAM: It's very hard to read them upside-down.

2480
03:20:15,833 --> 03:20:18,898
LAURA: Could I inquire to Lady Briarwood?

2481
03:20:18,898 --> 03:20:24,400
MATT: You're saying this out loud? The
conversation comes to a halt, she-- "Yes, of course.

2482
03:20:24,400 --> 03:20:26,729
"I'm so sorry, what was your name again?"

2483
03:20:26,729 --> 03:20:27,975
LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

2484
03:20:27,975 --> 03:20:30,582
MATT: "Vex'ahlia. Absolute pleasure to meet you.
Delilah."

2485
03:20:30,582 --> 03:20:36,975
LAURA: You as well. I notice your dress is quite
lovely. It doesn't look like a fashion that I'm

2486
03:20:36,975 --> 03:20:39,670
used to seeing. Where do you hail from
originally?

2487
03:20:39,670 --> 03:20:44,717
MATT: "We hail from Wildemount. It's quite a ways
from here. The continent to the far east."

2488
03:20:44,717 --> 03:20:46,489
LAURA: Really, I'm not familiar.

2489
03:20:46,489 --> 03:20:50,255
MATT: "You should come by sometime. We haven't
been home in a number of years, having to tend to

2490
03:20:50,255 --> 03:20:57,264
"Whitestone, but we have quite an elaborate
homestead there. We'd love to have you come stay

2491
03:20:57,264 --> 03:20:59,810
"with us if you ever find yourself in that side of
the world."

2492
03:20:59,810 --> 03:21:03,151
LAURA: I would love to visit. How long have you
been at Whitestone?

2493
03:21:03,151 --> 03:21:07,863
MATT: "We've been at Whitestone for the better
part of-- I can't even remember."

2494
03:21:07,863 --> 03:21:16,351
And Lord Briarwood looks, he goes, "Best I can
recall, four or five years. It was an unfortunate

2495
03:21:16,351 --> 03:21:22,183
"mantle to pick up but we've done what we can in
honor of the passed de Rolo family."

2496
03:21:22,183 --> 03:21:25,738
SAM: Oh, sorry.

2497
03:21:25,738 --> 03:21:31,905
ORION: I was just going to ask, you seem such a
lovely couple. Do you have any children?

2498
03:21:32,051 --> 03:21:41,843
MATT: "We unfortunately do not. It seems it was
not in the cards for us to bear. However, we

2499
03:21:41,843 --> 03:21:52,401
"consider many of our esteemed servants and house
guests our extended family. So we can leave a

2500
03:21:52,401 --> 03:21:55,321
"legacy, however we can possibly do so."

2501
03:21:55,321 --> 03:21:57,879
LAURA: Can we insight check as, what they're
saying?

2502
03:21:57,879 --> 03:22:00,655
MATT: Certainly.

2503
03:22:00,655 --> 03:22:07,546
LAURA: I mean, I know they're lying out their
asses. Fuck. 18.

2504
03:22:07,546 --> 03:22:09,830
MATT: 18? Seems pretty earnest.

2505
03:22:09,830 --> 03:22:14,348
SAM: Lord Briarwood. Down here, hi.

2506
03:22:14,348 --> 03:22:19,197
MATT: "I'm sorry, I--" he snaps and a servant
moves a large like pig platter out of the way that

2507
03:22:19,197 --> 03:22:20,857
was blocking your head from his vision.

2508
03:22:20,857 --> 03:22:23,128
TRAVIS: You can move that over here actually,
thank you. (chomping noises)

2509
03:22:23,128 --> 03:22:31,446
SAM: Lord Briarwood, we may share a mutual friend
or acquaintance of some sort. My father was a

2510
03:22:31,446 --> 03:22:41,259
prominent doctor, and he may have studied medicine
with a fellow that you know named Dr. Ripulah,

2511
03:22:41,259 --> 03:22:44,689
Ripley? Dr. Ripley? Do you know such a person?

2512
03:22:44,689 --> 03:22:50,143
MATT: "Yes, actually. Dr. Ripley is one of our
esteemed physicians in Whitestone. Yes, recently

2513
03:22:50,143 --> 03:22:55,910
"come into some land herself, although she has been
on holiday for some time. Following her own

2514
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:58,034
"research as doctors are wont to do."

2515
03:22:58,034 --> 03:23:00,346
SAM: Are you close with her?

2516
03:23:00,346 --> 03:23:05,604
MATT: "I wouldn't say close, but she's been a
friend at times, and she was one of the few that

2517
03:23:05,604 --> 03:23:13,969
"came with us from Wildemount over to Whitestone and
has helped us restructure and maintain and help

2518
03:23:13,969 --> 03:23:17,738
"facilitate the blossoming of a city without a
leader."

2519
03:23:17,738 --> 03:23:22,481
SAM: She sounds wonderful. Well, when you see her
next tell her that my father,

2520
03:23:22,481 --> 03:23:27,397
Dr. Jeff Shorthalt, said hi.

2521
03:23:27,397 --> 03:23:30,645
MATT: "Jeff Shorthalt, I will be happy to pass
that along."

2522
03:23:30,645 --> 03:23:35,062
TALIESIN: Lord Briarwood, I am not familiar with
Whitestone.

2523
03:23:35,062 --> 03:23:40,596
How did you become caretaker of such a place?

2524
03:23:40,596 --> 03:23:47,734
MATT: At which point, one of the other council
members goes, "Um." and puts his hand out.

2525
03:23:47,734 --> 03:24:03,645
"It's all right," and he pats the hand of his
wife. He looks over at you with a smile. "We know

2526
03:24:03,645 --> 03:24:16,419
"not if it is connected with the disease, but
before all this occurred, we became very close

2527
03:24:16,419 --> 03:24:29,175
"friends with the de Rolo family about ten or so
years ago. Actually, the first time we met is an

2528
03:24:29,175 --> 03:24:31,739
"interesting tale, if you want to tell it,
please."

2529
03:24:31,739 --> 03:24:40,686
His wife goes, "All right all right, so they were
taking a brief vacation east to Wildemount.

2530
03:24:40,686 --> 03:24:45,082
"Apparently, they had not traveled and they brought
their family with them, a whole gaggle of small

2531
03:24:45,082 --> 03:24:51,623
"children. They were coming this direction. Now our
homestead is on the western outskirts of Wildemount

2532
03:24:51,623 --> 03:24:57,171
"so one of the first places you traverse before
going into the kingdom proper. However, the

2533
03:24:57,171 --> 03:25:02,589
"family, the de Rolo family had been caught in a
bad downpour, a storm that had blown in and made

2534
03:25:02,589 --> 03:25:09,649
"travel rather impossible, and apparently they
stopped not far from our homestead. They came to

2535
03:25:09,649 --> 03:25:15,250
"our front door asking for shelter for the evening,
and we were happy to house them. We gave them dry

2536
03:25:15,250 --> 03:25:21,488
"clothes, food for the night, and well, a rather
fast friendship was forged. As we quickly began to

2537
03:25:21,488 --> 03:25:27,266
"notice they weren't just rabble of the street,
they themselves were highborn as we were and in a

2538
03:25:27,266 --> 03:25:32,271
"very dire circumstance. So we let them in, they
stayed for but a week. We showed them about the

2539
03:25:32,271 --> 03:25:37,617
"western side of Wildemount and let them on their
way. And since then we've had many different years

2540
03:25:37,617 --> 03:25:43,599
"we've spent together as families going on various
journeys and trips together. But as time went on

2541
03:25:43,599 --> 03:25:52,531
"we got busy on our own and separate ways and we
hadn't spoken in a while. They were in the process

2542
03:25:52,531 --> 03:26:00,360
"of discussing the building of the Uriel bridge
about five years ago, and we were going to meet

2543
03:26:00,360 --> 03:26:09,379
"with them about pursuing this venture as a joint--
well, when the disease took them. The family

2544
03:26:09,379 --> 03:26:18,822
"passed on. We were surprised that they would've
considered leaving Whitestone in our name, and we

2545
03:26:18,822 --> 03:26:26,204
"couldn't say no, at this point. To carry on their
legacy, I felt, was important enough let alone the

2546
03:26:26,204 --> 03:26:34,965
"memory of that to carry on the building of this
Uriel bridge. I thought I really wanted to

2547
03:26:34,965 --> 03:26:36,897
"spearhead the wishes of Frederick."

2548
03:26:36,897 --> 03:26:40,364
ORION: That is so courageous of you. Do you want
me to Fireball her now?

2549
03:26:40,364 --> 03:26:42,177
TALIESIN: A toast, then!

2550
03:26:42,177 --> 03:26:45,335
MATT: "A toast."

2551
03:26:45,335 --> 03:26:47,243
TALIESIN: To gracious hosts.

2552
03:26:47,243 --> 03:26:49,437
MATT: "To gracious hosts."

2553
03:26:49,437 --> 03:26:51,770
SAM: L'Chaim.

2554
03:26:51,770 --> 03:26:54,416
ORION: Gesundheit.

2555
03:26:54,416 --> 03:27:10,915
MATT: "So. Uriel," and he looks across the way and
says, "one of our largest exports in Whitestone is

2556
03:27:10,915 --> 03:27:19,139
"timber from the forests and woods that surround
Whitestone and the Alabaster Sierras. We've had a

2557
03:27:19,139 --> 03:27:25,597
"rising danger in the surrounding woods. It has
made it proven difficult to export most of these

2558
03:27:25,597 --> 03:27:33,763
"wooded goods. If it is possible, we would like for
you to send some aid, perhaps a small band of

2559
03:27:33,763 --> 03:27:36,301
"soldiers to lead a strike into the woods."

2560
03:27:36,301 --> 03:27:40,366
Uriel looks across the way and says, "Ah yes, we
can definitely discuss that, I don't see why not.

2561
03:27:40,366 --> 03:27:43,248
"We are currently in peacetime and we have a
reserve of soldiers we can send your way."

2562
03:27:43,248 --> 03:27:46,672
MARISHA: I mean, we're also free.

2563
03:27:46,672 --> 03:27:50,502
SAM: Oh yes.

2564
03:27:50,502 --> 03:28:01,005
MATT: As the meal continues on, more conversations
arise. A lot of bureaucratic BS. Anyone want to

2565
03:28:01,005 --> 03:28:03,181
interject anything or ask any questions?

2566
03:28:03,181 --> 03:28:04,887
ORION: Is Allura there, still?

2567
03:28:04,887 --> 03:28:06,221
MATT: Allura is there, yes.

2568
03:28:06,221 --> 03:28:15,440
ORION: As we're eating I'm going to: By the way,
did you ever perhaps finish making that extra

2569
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:21,885
earring I gave you several weeks ago? I don't know
how long it's been.

2570
03:28:21,885 --> 03:28:26,818
MATT: Allura looks, glances over to the side and
says, "Yes, it's been completed. No one's come by

2571
03:28:26,818 --> 03:28:28,158
"to take it from me"

2572
03:28:28,158 --> 03:28:29,849
ORION: I had no idea, I'll send someone.

2573
03:28:29,849 --> 03:28:35,820
MATT: "And as a note, I'm about a month away from
completing the sigil in the base mentof your keep."

2574
03:28:35,820 --> 03:28:44,673
ORION: Oh, wonderful. Thank you, that's-- so
talented. What flavor tea do you like, Allura?

2575
03:28:44,792 --> 03:28:48,589
MATT: "I prefer a mint or jasmine, to be honest."

2576
03:28:48,589 --> 03:28:51,884
ORION: Noted. I walk away

2577
03:28:51,884 --> 03:29:02,016
MATT: You step up and walk away from the dinner
table. (chair scraping) Tiberius stands up in the

2578
03:29:02,016 --> 03:29:04,020
middle of the discussion and walks away from the
feast

2579
03:29:04,020 --> 03:29:09,041
TALIESIN: Lady Briarwood, it is such an act of
compassion to take on such responsibility as a

2580
03:29:09,041 --> 03:29:11,099
house such as Whitestone.

2581
03:29:11,099 --> 03:29:12,713
SAM: Tiberius, get back here.

2582
03:29:12,713 --> 03:29:13,867
ORION: You said walk away.

2583
03:29:13,867 --> 03:29:15,161
SAM: No! Not every time!

2584
03:29:15,161 --> 03:29:19,343
MATT: "Well, thank you. This is the first time
we've been away from Whitestone in many years."

2585
03:29:19,343 --> 03:29:28,773
TALIESIN: That's such a spectacular act of
kindness and generosity. Would, perhaps, Vox

2586
03:29:28,773 --> 03:29:31,353
Machina also be of service to you?

2587
03:29:31,353 --> 03:29:38,256
MATT: "Perhaps, you seem strong of build and--"

2588
03:29:38,256 --> 03:29:42,661
LAURA: We are handier than we look.

2589
03:29:42,661 --> 03:29:44,934
MARISHA: We killed a beholder once.

2590
03:29:44,934 --> 03:29:48,290
TRAVIS: Just right out with it.

2591
03:29:48,290 --> 03:29:51,993
MATT: "That is an impressive feat, young
Keyleth."

2592
03:29:51,993 --> 03:29:54,042
MARISHA: We should just lead with that.

2593
03:29:54,042 --> 03:29:57,769
TALIESIN: And we killed an illithid once, as
well.

2594
03:29:57,769 --> 03:30:02,920
MATT: "Slain a beholder? Uriel, you keep in the
presence of some mighty heroes."

2595
03:30:02,920 --> 03:30:12,219
Uriel goes, (chuckles) "They are proven allies. I
mean, if you utilize their assistance. That would

2596
03:30:12,219 --> 03:30:18,881
"be very possible. May have something coming up
that I could use them for myself, but we'll

2597
03:30:18,881 --> 03:30:24,481
"discuss in time. Nevertheless, the meal
continues." She smiles and looks back at you.

2598
03:30:24,481 --> 03:30:36,488
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if that
look at Percy-not-Percy was--

2599
03:30:36,488 --> 03:30:39,649
MATT: You can make an insight check, sure.

2600
03:30:39,649 --> 03:30:43,576
TALIESIN: Can you? Can you make an insight check?
I don't think you can.

2601
03:30:43,576 --> 03:30:45,337
MARISHA: She looked interesting.

2602
03:30:45,337 --> 03:30:52,315
MATT: You're distracted by the pattern, the
brocade across her torso area.

2603
03:30:52,315 --> 03:30:55,268
TALIESIN: You know, you could roll lower if you
tried.

2604
03:30:55,268 --> 03:31:00,503
ORION: I want to do an arcana check on them.

2605
03:31:00,503 --> 03:31:02,494
MATT: What are you checking for?

2606
03:31:02,494 --> 03:31:09,063
ORION: If they're armed with anything that has
arcane properties.

2607
03:31:09,063 --> 03:31:13,907
MATT: Make an arcana check. It's not so much
something you can sense, more than you can look

2608
03:31:13,907 --> 03:31:21,247
for symbols. You rolled a 17? It looks like there
are elements of their accoutrements that are, like

2609
03:31:21,247 --> 03:31:28,913
any of you are carrying on yourselves. There's a
choker that's part of the outfit that Lady

2610
03:31:28,913 --> 03:31:34,322
Briarwood wears that itself does appear to have
some tiny enchantment-based markings across it.

2611
03:31:34,322 --> 03:31:39,078
They are adorned in various protective magic, but
so is everybody else at the table.

2612
03:31:39,078 --> 03:31:40,881
ORION: Got you. Standard gear.

2613
03:31:40,881 --> 03:31:44,658
GROG: Lord and Lady Briarwood, we are, in fact,
quite handy.

2614
03:31:44,658 --> 03:31:48,739
Vax, we also killed an illithid, if I recall.

2615
03:31:48,739 --> 03:31:54,335
TALIESIN: I think we did. Did we befriend an
illithid or kill it? I think we did both.

2616
03:31:54,335 --> 03:31:57,449
ORION: We befriended it, it betrayed us, and then
we killed it.

2617
03:31:57,449 --> 03:32:05,495
SAM: But enough about us. Earlier, you were
telling us about a poor family that came down with

2618
03:32:05,495 --> 03:32:11,685
that disease. I'm just curious, coming from a
medical family.

2619
03:32:11,685 --> 03:32:16,124
What was the disease that they had?

2620
03:32:16,124 --> 03:32:26,526
MATT: They look at each other and give a sorrowful
look. "We do not know. We were only given the

2621
03:32:26,526 --> 03:32:31,843
"information that the family had passed, but a
month or two after it had already occurred."

2622
03:32:31,843 --> 03:32:35,831
MARISHA: The entire family. All of them?

2623
03:32:35,831 --> 03:32:39,542
MATT: "Most of the castle seemed to have fallen to
it, as well."

2624
03:32:39,542 --> 03:32:40,980
LAURA: So dreadful.

2625
03:32:40,980 --> 03:32:47,080
MATT: Uriel says, "My condolences, by the way. I
understand that's very hard."

2626
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:51,096
"It's all right. The least we could do is try to
carry on their legacy."

2627
03:32:51,096 --> 03:32:56,735
LAURA: I know how hard it is to lose someone very
close to you. I'm sorry for your loss.

2628
03:32:56,735 --> 03:33:02,257
MATT: "It's appreciated." He looks at his wife,
and she looks up for a second. "It's all right."

2629
03:33:02,257 --> 03:33:13,283
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm just a little confused. If
the whole family died of disease, weren't you

2630
03:33:13,283 --> 03:33:17,352
afraid to go into this town, into this castle?
Weren't you afraid of

2631
03:33:17,352 --> 03:33:20,474
contracting this disease yourself?

2632
03:33:20,474 --> 03:33:28,240
MATT: "There was worry of such a thing, but before
Whitestone castle could be entered, we made sure

2633
03:33:28,240 --> 03:33:36,139
"to send in our best clerics to rid of any existing
possible lingering disease, and to make sure to

2634
03:33:36,139 --> 03:33:40,284
"remove any corpses or bodies that may contain it.
There was a period of time that we were worried,

2635
03:33:40,284 --> 03:33:48,212
"but after a few months, we came to the conclusion
that we were safe, and thus we moved our way in."

2636
03:33:48,212 --> 03:33:50,677
TRAVIS: Lucky for you.

2637
03:33:50,677 --> 03:33:57,497
SAM: Anyone care for some games of jenga?

2638
03:33:57,497 --> 03:34:08,336
MATT: At this point, the dessert has been brought
out. It's a fine, almost creme brulee-type dish.

2639
03:34:08,336 --> 03:34:09,542
It's delicious.

2640
03:34:09,542 --> 03:34:14,930
LAURA: Are they whispering to themselves, still?

2641
03:34:14,930 --> 03:34:23,754
MATT: As part of the discussions, there are a few
side exchanges here and there. The best you can

2642
03:34:23,754 --> 03:34:29,081
make from it is, "Did you notice him?"

2643
03:34:29,081 --> 03:34:42,320
She says, "Yes, don't worry." And, "Tonight, we'll
stay." And those are the only things you can make

2644
03:34:42,320 --> 03:34:44,595
out from the exchanges back and forth.

2645
03:34:44,595 --> 03:34:51,595
LAURA: How long do you plan on staying here, Lord
and Lady?

2646
03:34:51,595 --> 03:35:00,010
MATT: "Well, after this dinner, I imagine a few
days, and we'll be on our way. We're merely here

2647
03:35:00,010 --> 03:35:05,570
"to finalize the paperwork for the bridge
construction." She looks over and gives a nod to

2648
03:35:05,570 --> 03:35:13,406
Lord Daxio, who gives her a nod back. "And maybe
see the city for a while, and make our way back.

2649
03:35:13,406 --> 03:35:16,292
"It's too hard to be away, and our nephew has been
left in charge of this."

2650
03:35:16,292 --> 03:35:22,063
LAURA: Do you have plans on the morrow? I would
love to give you a tour of the city.

2651
03:35:22,063 --> 03:35:23,667
MATT: "That would be lovely."

2652
03:35:23,667 --> 03:35:29,132
LAURA: Wonderful! Should I send word? How should
we arrange this?

2653
03:35:29,132 --> 03:35:30,560
MATT: "Where are you staying?"

2654
03:35:30,560 --> 03:35:34,593
LAURA: We are outside of town at our own keep,
actually.

2655
03:35:34,593 --> 03:35:36,176
MATT: "What's it called?"

2656
03:35:36,176 --> 03:35:38,997
LAURA: The Greyskull Keep.

2657
03:35:38,997 --> 03:35:42,366
MATT: "Greyskull Keep. We will have you sent for
when the time is right."

2658
03:35:42,366 --> 03:35:47,624
LAURA: Lovely. That will be so fun.

2659
03:35:47,624 --> 03:35:53,129
ORION: Vex is so into showing people our city.

2660
03:35:53,129 --> 03:35:57,118
LAURA: Perhaps you can show me some more of your
fashions. I love your dress so much.

2661
03:35:57,118 --> 03:36:01,490
MATT: "Oh, well it's hard to show you this here.
What you need to see is the Wildemount fashion

2662
03:36:01,490 --> 03:36:04,132
"district. It is divine."

2663
03:36:04,132 --> 03:36:05,802
LAURA: Sounds wonderful.

2664
03:36:05,802 --> 03:36:10,635
TRAVIS: I look at Vax and I go, does anyone want
any dessert?

2665
03:36:10,635 --> 03:36:12,980
ORION: (gulping) I'm having a little.

2666
03:36:12,980 --> 03:36:15,700
LAURA: Vax? You looked at Vax?

2667
03:36:15,700 --> 03:36:21,262
TRAVIS: Yeah. Vaxy. The one that I can look at.

2668
03:36:21,262 --> 03:36:30,725
ORION: Do you want dessert now? Would you like
this fireball creme brulee?

2669
03:36:30,725 --> 03:36:32,239
TALIESIN: I'm just fine.

2670
03:36:32,239 --> 03:36:34,603
MARISHA: (whispered) I don't know what to do now.

2671
03:36:34,603 --> 03:36:39,239
MATT: The meal has been now wound down, the dishes
are being gathered by the servants, the wine has

2672
03:36:39,239 --> 03:36:48,794
stopped being poured, and now everyone settles in
with sighs of a meal well spent. The other council

2673
03:36:48,794 --> 03:36:54,187
members begin to excuse themselves. Uriel stands
up and says, "My apologies, me and my wife find

2674
03:36:54,187 --> 03:37:01,362
"that rest is in our future. Please, feel free to
walk the halls as you see fit. Thank you again,

2675
03:37:01,362 --> 03:37:06,272
"Lord and Lady Briarwood, for joining us, and we're
excited to continue this venture.

2676
03:37:06,272 --> 03:37:08,526
"Good night to you all."

2677
03:37:08,526 --> 03:37:10,746
MARISHA: Hey, you should Hunter's Mark them or
something.

2678
03:37:10,746 --> 03:37:12,735
SAM: Wait, no, that's Uriel that's leaving.

2679
03:37:12,735 --> 03:37:19,923
LIAM: What's the gentleman who realized that I was
there? Earlier, before we came in?

2680
03:37:19,923 --> 03:37:24,032
MATT: Asum? He's not in the room. He's been
waiting in the foyer for you.

2681
03:37:24,032 --> 03:37:28,716
LAURA: He was telling you to meet him in the
foyer, a long time ago.

2682
03:37:28,716 --> 03:37:30,160
LIAM: Oh, that's all right.

2683
03:37:30,160 --> 03:37:36,514
LAURA: (whispered) You should go spy on their
room. Go check out that room. I'll distract them.

2684
03:37:36,514 --> 03:37:39,577
TRAVIS: (muffled) Go see if he's still there.

2685
03:37:39,577 --> 03:37:47,896
MATT: Lord and Lady Briarwood also stand up. "On
that note as well, I think our meal has come to an

2686
03:37:47,896 --> 03:37:52,586
"end. We appreciate your--" and Lady Briarwood
continues the sentence,

2687
03:37:52,586 --> 03:37:55,460
"and we wish you all a fine night--"

2688
03:37:55,460 --> 03:38:02,338
LIAM: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste and scuttling
along the ceiling back towards the door.

2689
03:38:02,338 --> 03:38:11,261
ORION: I know a particular spell that it's rather
wonderful. And I go blow a stream out and do a

2690
03:38:11,261 --> 03:38:17,570
cantrip, Control Magic, and start doing a nice
dragon fire dance that I know of from my home.

2691
03:38:17,570 --> 03:38:19,369
SAM: I play a little flute.

2692
03:38:19,369 --> 03:38:21,836
MATT: They both sit and watch for a moment--

2693
03:38:21,836 --> 03:38:28,049
SAM: (Star Wars Cantina song)

2694
03:38:28,049 --> 03:38:30,045
LIAM: Am I finding what's-his-face?

2695
03:38:30,045 --> 03:38:33,763
MATT: You make your way out, and he's not there.
You don't see him anywhere.

2696
03:38:33,763 --> 03:38:35,265
LIAM: I'm doubling back.

2697
03:38:35,265 --> 03:38:41,615
MATT: Okay, you double back. After about a minute
of this, "Yes, well, thank you kindly for that

2698
03:38:41,615 --> 03:38:47,408
"wondrous display. I feel that sleep takes us, and
we are going to retire to our quarters. Have a

2699
03:38:47,408 --> 03:38:48,874
"wonderful night, everyone."

2700
03:38:48,874 --> 03:38:50,394
MARISHA: Are you staying within the castle?

2701
03:38:50,394 --> 03:38:51,535
MATT: "Yes, yes."

2702
03:38:51,535 --> 03:38:54,042
MARISHA: Oh! Fantastic.

2703
03:38:54,042 --> 03:38:55,333
ORION: Have a wonderful rest.

2704
03:38:55,333 --> 03:39:00,462
MATT: "And good night." And they both stand up,
and then they make their way out, through the main

2705
03:39:00,462 --> 03:39:02,056
great hall exit.

2706
03:39:02,056 --> 03:39:03,418
LIAM: I'm following.

2707
03:39:03,418 --> 03:39:10,630
MATT: Okay. You gather across the ceiling as you
go. You watch them head up the stairway to the

2708
03:39:10,630 --> 03:39:17,422
second floor. They head to the right, down a long
hallway, a series of doors. They come up to a

2709
03:39:17,422 --> 03:39:22,627
door, where there are two guards standing outside.
The same guards that led them inside the

2710
03:39:22,627 --> 03:39:24,504
building, and were riding on horseback.

2711
03:39:24,504 --> 03:39:26,746
LAURA: Could I Hunter's Mark him before they go in
their bedroom?

2712
03:39:26,746 --> 03:39:31,027
MATT: Hunter's Mark is technically a minor spell.
You could try it.

2713
03:39:31,027 --> 03:39:33,969
LAURA: I mean they're walking away, when their
back is turned, could I do it when they're not

2714
03:39:33,969 --> 03:39:35,270
paying attention?

2715
03:39:35,270 --> 03:39:42,718
MATT: I'd say, make a stealth check. Trying to do
this subtly at the table.

2716
03:39:42,718 --> 03:39:43,816
LAURA: 20!

2717
03:39:43,816 --> 03:39:45,862
(cheers)

2718
03:39:45,862 --> 03:39:48,557
MATT: You Hunter's Mark which one?

2719
03:39:48,557 --> 03:39:51,669
LAURA: Lord-- no--

2720
03:39:51,669 --> 03:39:53,123
SAM: Sylas or Delilah?

2721
03:39:53,123 --> 03:39:54,344
LAURA: Delilah.

2722
03:39:54,344 --> 03:40:00,484
MATT: Okay, you mark Delilah as she walks off. You
have a sense of where she is at all times in the

2723
03:40:00,484 --> 03:40:04,610
vicinity. As you follow them, they go to the door,
the guards open the door for them, and lead them

2724
03:40:04,610 --> 03:40:06,482
into their room, and then close the door.

2725
03:40:06,482 --> 03:40:14,322
LIAM: Oh, that fast? All right. How close to the
door are the guards? Right up against it?

2726
03:40:14,322 --> 03:40:16,853
MATT: Not against it, but immediately to the right
and left of it.

2727
03:40:16,853 --> 03:40:20,554
LAURA: I don't know what else to do, you guys.

2728
03:40:20,554 --> 03:40:34,227
SAM: Burn their room down. We've got to find
Seeker Assam, or whatever his name is.

2729
03:40:34,227 --> 03:40:41,845
LIAM: I yank off my serpent belt and throw it as
far as I can. Not as far as I can. 20 feet, and

2730
03:40:41,845 --> 03:40:46,136
set it in motion, so there's now a snake in the
hall, 20 feet in front of these guys.

2731
03:40:46,136 --> 03:40:56,744
MATT: All right. You take it, and you throw the
snake. Let me check one thing on Invisibility real

2732
03:40:56,744 --> 03:40:59,488
fast. Just because--

2733
03:40:59,488 --> 03:41:02,749
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, just, snake flies down
the hall--

2734
03:41:02,749 --> 03:41:06,543
ORION: If he does an action, it dissipates the
spell. It's not Greater Invisibility, so he goes

2735
03:41:06,543 --> 03:41:09,897
uninvisible, when he does something.

2736
03:41:09,897 --> 03:41:17,767
MATT: "Attacks or casts a spell." It's not either
of those. It's activating an item. You take the

2737
03:41:17,767 --> 03:41:22,381
belt (whoosh), fling it (hissing), the snake
appears to the side. One of the guards looks over.

2738
03:41:22,381 --> 03:41:27,873
Looks over at the other guard, he pulls out his
weapon and one of the guards steps over to where

2739
03:41:27,873 --> 03:41:33,622
the serpent is and starts trying to stomp it out,
and it nips up and gets some of the armor, and

2740
03:41:33,622 --> 03:41:35,397
he's just, stomping out the snake.

2741
03:41:35,397 --> 03:41:36,783
LIAM: So one's 20 feet away now?

2742
03:41:36,783 --> 03:41:38,374
MATT: About 25 feet away, yeah.

2743
03:41:38,374 --> 03:41:39,754
LIAM: 25 feet away, and one guy stayed?

2744
03:41:39,754 --> 03:41:41,561
MATT: Yeah.

2745
03:41:41,561 --> 03:41:43,128
SAM: Kill them.

2746
03:41:43,128 --> 03:41:47,007
LIAM: I drop, and I'm going to bean him on the
head, like his name is Kynan.

2747
03:41:47,007 --> 03:41:53,340
MATT: Okay! All right. As you leap off the top,
you (whoosh) land on the ground.

2748
03:41:53,340 --> 03:41:55,348
Go ahead and roll an attack.

2749
03:41:55,348 --> 03:41:59,775
LIAM: Okay. "Advantage on attack rolls against any
creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet."

2750
03:41:59,775 --> 03:42:01,606
MATT: And he is surprised, because he does not
know you're there.

2751
03:42:01,606 --> 03:42:14,343
LIAM: And I'm invisible, so that's an 18. That is
29 to hit. Using the blunt end! I just want to

2752
03:42:14,343 --> 03:42:15,657
knock him out.

2753
03:42:15,657 --> 03:42:18,449
MATT: Right, okay. Go ahead and roll sneak attack
damage.

2754
03:42:18,449 --> 03:42:37,162
LIAM: Doubled. 12, 17, 23, 24, 26, so 52. Plus--
No, I mean, if I am as skilled a rogue as I am,

2755
03:42:37,162 --> 03:42:44,638
how could I not just want to knock somebody out,
and not unintentionally-- ten. On top of the 52.

2756
03:42:44,638 --> 03:42:51,682
MATT: 62 damage will do it. You (whack) right to
the side of the helmet, with a dull (thud) sound.

2757
03:42:51,682 --> 03:42:54,376
Just falls like a sack of potatoes right against
the wall.

2758
03:42:54,376 --> 03:42:56,397
LIAM: Hand on the door. Is it locked?

2759
03:42:56,397 --> 03:43:03,204
MATT: The door is currently not locked. You can
see the guard you just knocked out, had the key in

2760
03:43:03,204 --> 03:43:07,195
his hand and was in the process of going to lock
the door right when that happened.

2761
03:43:07,195 --> 03:43:15,130
LIAM: Okay, so I flip my hood over my head, and I
quietly go in the door.

2762
03:43:15,130 --> 03:43:17,758
SAM: Oh wait, you're not invisible anymore.

2763
03:43:17,758 --> 03:43:19,188
LIAM: Yeah, I know.

2764
03:43:19,188 --> 03:43:24,052
MATT: Okay. So. (creak) You open the door and
enter the room, closing it behind you. As soon as

2765
03:43:24,052 --> 03:43:30,761
you enter the room, it's a large guest room. There
are two windows across the way with curtains drawn

2766
03:43:30,761 --> 03:43:36,904
to the side. You can see the darkness of the night
sky behind that, and the rest of the low-lit

2767
03:43:36,904 --> 03:43:42,522
Cloudtop District visible, and the courtyard
surrounding the palace. Immediately to the right

2768
03:43:42,522 --> 03:43:46,774
and left of you, you see two large tables that are
covered in black cloths, that are just, tables to

2769
03:43:46,774 --> 03:43:51,895
be, you know, vases and stuff set up on them.
One's clean, one has actual decor on it. There are

2770
03:43:51,895 --> 03:43:56,587
two wooden tables immediately to the right and
left of you. There's a large red rug, central to

2771
03:43:56,587 --> 03:44:02,963
the floor, that is circular, and on the far
corners next to the two windows you see armoires,

2772
03:44:02,963 --> 03:44:09,678
like dressers, for clothing and such. In the
center of the room, you see, on top of the rug,

2773
03:44:09,678 --> 03:44:15,574
against the wall between the two windows is a
large canopy bed, very beautifully carved from

2774
03:44:15,574 --> 03:44:22,617
dark wood, has a purple cloth silk canopy that
drifts down around it. And on the far end, you can

2775
03:44:22,617 --> 03:44:27,300
see now, against one of the tables, is Lady
Briarwood is currently taking jewelry off of one

2776
03:44:27,300 --> 03:44:33,765
of her arms while Lord Briarwood is right by the
bed, holding on to the post, like he's just walked

2777
03:44:33,765 --> 03:44:35,157
over to that area.

2778
03:44:35,157 --> 03:44:36,332
LIAM: They're both at the bed?

2779
03:44:36,332 --> 03:44:37,438
MATT: They're both at the bed.

2780
03:44:37,438 --> 03:44:41,457
LIAM: I got a 25 for stealth and it didn't work?

2781
03:44:41,457 --> 03:44:43,371
MATT: They're both looking in your direction.

2782
03:44:43,371 --> 03:44:52,601
LIAM: All right. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I heard a noise
in here. I work for the city. I apologize. That

2783
03:44:52,601 --> 03:44:58,824
was really stupid. As you were. I walk out.

2784
03:44:58,824 --> 03:45:00,774
MATT: Make a deception check.

2785
03:45:00,774 --> 03:45:06,635
LIAM: I'll use my last Luck of the day. Didn't do
it; same thing. Nine, 11.

2786
03:45:06,635 --> 03:45:08,035
MATT: 11?

2787
03:45:08,035 --> 03:45:09,276
LIAM: Yeah.

2788
03:45:09,276 --> 03:45:20,497
MATT: Lord Briarwood goes, "Oh, well, that's all
right. Not to worry, in no serious rush. Isn't

2789
03:45:20,497 --> 03:45:22,250
"that right, my dear?"

2790
03:45:22,250 --> 03:45:29,021
And she looks over, she stops taking her jewelry
off and turns. "Yes, yes, of course. As you, a man

2791
03:45:29,021 --> 03:45:30,576
"who works for the city."

2792
03:45:30,576 --> 03:45:32,037
LIAM: Yes ma'am.

2793
03:45:32,037 --> 03:45:34,089
MATT: "What do you do for the city, if I may
ask?"

2794
03:45:34,089 --> 03:45:40,515
LIAM: Oh, I'm a guard. I mean, there's not really
a name for what I do. I work for Uriel, I just--

2795
03:45:40,515 --> 03:45:46,973
I'm security, ma'am, and I thought I heard a noise
in here. And I heard a body fall, I thought--

2796
03:45:46,973 --> 03:45:48,357
sounded like a body fell.

2797
03:45:48,357 --> 03:45:51,300
MATT: They both step a little bit closer. Looking
at you--

2798
03:45:51,300 --> 03:45:55,886
LIAM: I'm backing up as I'm talking, I'm right at
the door! I didn't shut it behind me, I just

2799
03:45:55,886 --> 03:45:57,091
cracked it open.

2800
03:45:57,091 --> 03:46:07,492
MATT: Right. Lady Briarwood goes, "You look
strangely similar to a gentleman we just had

2801
03:46:07,492 --> 03:46:08,870
"dinner with."

2802
03:46:08,870 --> 03:46:10,683
LIAM: That's crazy!

2803
03:46:10,683 --> 03:46:17,172
MATT: "It's uncanny how similar you look."

2804
03:46:17,172 --> 03:46:18,248
LIAM: Yep.

2805
03:46:18,248 --> 03:46:22,082
MATT: (arcane chanting)

2806
03:46:22,082 --> 03:46:23,893
LIAM: And I run!

2807
03:46:23,893 --> 03:46:28,664
MATT: You get to make a wisdom save, is what you
do.

2808
03:46:28,784 --> 03:46:31,075
SAM: Jenga!

2809
03:46:31,075 --> 03:46:33,484
LIAM: Not good. It's an eight.

2810
03:46:33,484 --> 03:46:39,424
MATT: You turn to move and your muscles
(crunching) tense up, as you're unable to

2811
03:46:39,424 --> 03:46:41,452
physically move.

2812
03:46:41,452 --> 03:46:44,324
LIAM: This is awkward, ma'am, I'm just trying to
do my job.

2813
03:46:44,324 --> 03:46:49,750
MATT: You're halfway through the doorway, stuck in
place, as she keeps walking forward now, giving

2814
03:46:49,750 --> 03:46:55,020
you a curious look. Lord Briarwood comes and
flanks you from the other side. (clicks tongue)

2815
03:46:55,175 --> 03:47:05,545
"You try and flee. I'm merely asking you questions.
Come, let us discuss in more private quarters."

2816
03:47:05,545 --> 03:47:09,214
And you feel the hand of Lord Briarwood slam onto
your other shoulder.

2817
03:47:09,214 --> 03:47:13,067
"Don't worry. You look delicious."

2818
03:47:13,067 --> 03:47:17,338
And he pulls you into the room as she
closes the door behind, and that's where we're

2819
03:47:17,338 --> 03:47:18,942
going to end tonight's session.

2820
03:47:18,942 --> 03:47:23,777
(screaming)

2821
03:47:23,777 --> 03:47:26,907
SAM: Jenga! We had a safe word for a reason!

2822
03:47:26,907 --> 03:47:29,556
LIAM: That's cool.

2823
03:47:29,556 --> 03:47:32,793
TRAVIS: Hashtag Save Vax!

2824
03:47:32,793 --> 03:47:36,074
MARISHA: Dude, I think they're into some weird
shit.

2825
03:47:36,074 --> 03:47:41,329
MATT: That was a very slow tension building
episode that turned very interesting at the end.

2826
03:47:41,329 --> 03:47:42,810
How you doing, Taliesin?!

2827
03:47:42,810 --> 03:47:45,364
TALIESIN: (yells and groans)

2828
03:47:45,364 --> 03:47:48,377
LAURA: They're so evil!

2829
03:47:48,377 --> 03:47:50,573
MARISHA: They're creeping me out, man.

2830
03:47:50,573 --> 03:47:53,157
TALIESIN: You're making it so much worse than I
ever imagined.

2831
03:47:53,157 --> 03:47:58,090
LAURA: They're totally vampires.

2832
03:47:58,090 --> 03:48:00,273
MARISHA: Now we're going to have to rescue Vax.

2833
03:48:00,273 --> 03:48:02,496
TALIESIN: I swear if the Briarwoods are
responsible for a party kill, I'm going to feel

2834
03:48:02,496 --> 03:48:04,065
like such an asshole.

2835
03:48:04,065 --> 03:48:09,335
MATT: (laughs) That'd be rough. Well, cool. We'll
all be picking up that next week on Thursday.

2836
03:48:09,335 --> 03:48:13,208
MARISHA: Oh, please, like you haven't rushed into
a situation before, Orion?

2837
03:48:13,208 --> 03:48:16,721
ORION: No! I never have. I can actually say that.

2838
03:48:16,721 --> 03:48:18,752
LIAM: Like attacking an inanimate door?

2839
03:48:18,752 --> 03:48:23,658
MARISHA: Yeah! Or, or launching a Fireball in the
middle of a wood house?

2840
03:48:23,658 --> 03:48:26,127
TALIESIN: Trying to convince an entire army of
illithid to follow you?

2841
03:48:26,127 --> 03:48:29,948
MARISHA: Yeah! Rushing off to Draconia to buy a
Bag of Holding.

2842
03:48:29,948 --> 03:48:34,787
SAM: Or just today, running off to the, to the
sigil!
