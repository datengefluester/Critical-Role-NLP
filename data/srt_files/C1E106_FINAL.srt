00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:03,534
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:09,614
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Before
we get into tonight's episode, we've got to get

3
00:00:09,614 --> 00:00:12,909
through a few announcements. First off, we have
our wonderful Darin De Paul joining us again.

4
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:16,105
(cheering)

5
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:17,779
MATT: Thank you, Darin.

6
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:18,820
DARIN: Thank you!

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,397
MATT: Excited to have you back. We've all
recovered from a crazy Comic-Con, mostly.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,014
LAURA: Have we recovered?

9
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:29,704
MATT: I'm being optimistic here. We're recovering
from a Comic-Con. Got a chance to meet a bunch of

10
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:34,333
you guys out there. It was a lot of fun, but we're
here to get our announcements started, so let me

11
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:38,414
do that. First off, Laura, I believe there's a
merch update.

12
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:44,402
LAURA: Yes, there is, and I just realized I had it
on and I hadn't announced it yet. So we got these

13
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:52,340
back in the store! But they're red now. We've got
them on this chain and on this chain rope-thing.

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,945
Cord. And we've got them a keychain. And now, I
don't know if you saw them before, but they took a

15
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:00,715
long time to get, and now we just have them in the
store.

16
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:02,550
SAM: Are they going to run out again?

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,690
LAURA: I don't know. It depends on how many people
buy them, I guess, but we're going to try to keep

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:16,785
them in stock. That's the statement that like,
okay, that happened, but this is what I'm really

19
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,947
excited about.

20
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,531
MARISHA: Tell them!

21
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:32,574
LAURA: (sings victory song) Is the camera on? I
can't tell. It's a pencil pack. I asked them to

22
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:38,333
make this, because this is so great. So we all
have our own pencils. Everybody has a pencil.

23
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:43,050
We've got the "How do you want to do this?"
pencil. We've got the "I would like to rage"

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:50,728
pencil. We've got a Scanlan pencil-- oh no, this
is a Tary pencil. This is a "Doty, take this down"

25
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:57,755
pencil. I don't want to say all the things because
they're so great, but check them out. It's in the

26
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:01,015
store now. Does everybody want their pencil?

27
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:06,902
SAM: Are these #2 pencils? Could someone take the
SAT with my "Doty, take this down" pencil?

28
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:08,839
LAURA: It's a #2 pencil!

29
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,779
SAM: Whoa, that's so amazing!

30
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,281
TRAVIS: Percy, what's yours?

31
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,004
TALIESIN: I don't want to say.

32
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:17,319
LAURA: Do you want the Trinket pencil, Darin?

33
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,408
DARIN: Yeah!

34
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:29,582
LAURA: Such a good one. Oh, this is the Pike
one. And here's yours, Matt. It's pretty dope, so

35
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,352
check them out. I'm in love.

36
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,987
MATT: What's great is if you use it a lot,
eventually "How do you want to do this?" becomes

37
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:41,861
"do you want to do this?" to "you want to do
this?" to "want to do this?" to "do this?" to

38
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:47,774
"this?" (laughs) It's existential the entire time
you're using the pencil. I'm really excited about

39
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:48,681
that.

40
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,916
LAURA: I hadn't even thought about that.

41
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,202
TALIESIN: I'm so excited now to see what it spells
out.

42
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:57,088
MATT: It just keeps on giving. Thank you, Laura.

43
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,008
LAURA: You're welcome. I'm excited.

44
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:06,014
MATT: All right. Next up, for Gen Con, we have our
live show. We only have about 400 tickets left.

45
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,166
SAM: Is that true?

46
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,112
TALIESIN and MATT: Yeah.

47
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:11,909
SAM: For us? We're just a bunch of nerdy-ass voice
actors.

48
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,223
TRAVIS: We already surpassed the number of seats
we had last year, because we have an extra

49
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:21,499
thousand seats in this larger theater. It's going
to be a madhouse. We only have 400 left.

50
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:25,537
LAURA: And there may or may not be-- I don't know
if I should announce this.

51
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:29,907
LIAM: One of us is going to die that night, and I
don't mean a character.

52
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:34,516
LAURA: We may or may not have special merchandise
that you can only get at the live show.

53
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:38,149
SAM: Whoa. But surely it will be in the store
afterwards?

54
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:40,107
LAURA: Nope, it's just a live show thing.

55
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:42,381
SAM: Just exclusive to the live show?

56
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:46,647
TRAVIS: Well, see, you'd have to be there to find
out, so if there is a car, a plane, or a train, or

57
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:51,567
a telephone booth around you, get to Indianapolis
on August 18th!

58
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,780
LAURA: August 18th! How was that?

59
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,648
TRAVIS: Shit. It was terrible. It was really bad.

60
00:03:57,648 --> 00:03:58,969
LAURA: Damn it.

61
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,528
MATT: I'll be excited if anyone got my Wonder
Showzen reference.

62
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:04,965
LIAM: Not even anyone at the table.

63
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:09,566
MATT: No. That means you means need to be
enlightened by the wonder that is Wonder Showzen.

64
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:16,096
No, you should not. It's disturbing as shit. Just
stacking you up today, boy!

65
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:20,191
DARIN: (child-like voice) This is the best place
ever! Thank you so much for this! It makes me very

66
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:21,344
happy.

67
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:27,246
MATT: Give him anything he wants if he keeps
making that sound. All right! Campaign guide info.

68
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:31,874
Update on the campaign guide stuff I would like to
give you. However, I think it's probably easier to

69
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:37,241
get it from the mama bird's mouth, so we actually
have in the studio today joining us, Chris Pramas

70
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,792
from Green Ronin.

71
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,210
(cheering)

72
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,964
MATT: Come in and join me down here for a second
and talk into the camera. Hey, buddy!

73
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,949
CHRIS: Too low? Is this all right?

74
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,745
MATT: I think we're all right.

75
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:51,103
LAURA: They might just see your forehead.

76
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:52,269
MATT: Just the forehead.

77
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:55,953
LAURA: There it is! I know, this is great.

78
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:57,592
MATT: So what's the update?

79
00:04:57,592 --> 00:05:04,129
CHRIS: So last week we put the campaign guide up
for sale and it exceeded all of our expectations,

80
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:11,736
yes. So thank you to everyone who pre-ordered.
This is by far the most successful pre-order that

81
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:18,556
we've ever had for a book, so you're rocking it.
It has led to an unexpected complication, though,

82
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:26,448
in that our initial print run is of a size that
cannot be changed right now. We had to stop taking

83
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:31,284
pre-orders so we would have some to send to
stores, because obviously, we value game stores

84
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:39,329
and we want them to have some, so I just wanted to
reassure everybody that this book is not a limited

85
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:45,171
edition book. We're printing more, so if you were
not able to pre-order it, you will be able to get

86
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:53,077
it later. We're basically going to immediate
reprint. In the interim, the PDF is still

87
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:57,991
available, so you can get that if you like
electronic books, or if you have a local store,

88
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:03,600
they can take part in what's called our Pre-Order
Plus program. It allows people to pre-order

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,839
through the store and then get the $5 PDF deal
that we were offering as part of the pre-order. So

90
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:16,005
ask your local stores, do you take part in
Pre-Order Plus? If you need a link for that, you

91
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:23,093
can check our Twitter. Otherwise, second print run
will be along as soon as we can get it.

92
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:28,325
MATT: Fantastic. Thank you so much, Chris!
Appreciate it, buddy. Enjoy the show!

93
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,373
CHRIS: Oh, and we'll have copies at Gen Con.

94
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,026
MATT: Yes, we'll have copies at Gen Con!

95
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:33,710
TRAVIS: Even more reason!

96
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,882
LIAM: Boy, is that book fucking beautiful!

97
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:37,163
MARISHA: It is!

98
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,830
LAURA: Good job, you guys.

99
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,801
MATT: I'm so nervous about its release.

100
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:45,053
SAM: I have some notes on the cover.

101
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:49,375
TRAVIS: I have some notes on the book. Could it
have less words?

102
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,642
MATT: No, it just has less gnome bard.

103
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:54,227
SAM: Oh shit.

104
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:59,536
LIAM: The whole race died off in a Calamity. They
don't know what happened. Pike was the only one

105
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,771
who was spared.

106
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:08,395
MATT: It's so weird. (laughs) Don't worry, we have
a fix on the way. It'll be fine. Next up: Critical

107
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,027
Role podcast on iTunes and such.

108
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:18,121
MARISHA: More is coming very soon. Very, very
soon. Next batch is coming.

109
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,862
MATT: Cool. So we'll have that announcement as
soon as we have the specific dates for the next

110
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:26,896
batch. Should be coming up very soon. Once again,
we have Talks Machina on Tuesdays. We'll be next

111
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:31,659
Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific to discuss this episode
tonight with our fantastic host, Brian Foster.

112
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:39,154
Looking forward to that. The Sagas of Sundry:
Dread show that me and Taliesin are part of. Fifth

113
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,019
episode is up is today on Alpha.

114
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:42,697
TALIESIN: It's almost over.

115
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,617
MATT: I know. We have one more episode of this,
right?

116
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:49,267
MARISHA: And check out these awesome Dread shirts,
you guys! They're in the store. Aren't they

117
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:50,390
awesome?

118
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:58,439
MATT: If you haven't seen it yet, it's a fantastic
pseudo-theater improv RPG horror show with me and

119
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,002
Taliesin as part of the cast. Marisha's one of the
executive producers, and Darin De Paul is our

120
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:07,807
fantastic Rod Serling intro personality. So check
it out if you haven't yet.

121
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,618
MARISHA: Mr. Wren!

122
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:15,634
MATT: Mr. Wren. It's a fun one. I think that's it.

123
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,578
LIAM: Wait, there's a couple more things.

124
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,405
MATT: They're not on the list!

125
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,646
LIAM: Well, you got a little boxy back there that
you should pull out.

126
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,142
MATT: Oh, right! Yes!

127
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:26,235
LAURA: What is it?

128
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:28,197
TRAVIS: Does it have a small creature in it?

129
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:29,821
LAURA: Does it have air holes?

130
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:35,454
MATT: This question has come up a lot. The combat
tiers, the plastic platforms that I use for height

131
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:39,206
in the game, have been out of stock, out of
production for a while now. They're finally

132
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:45,829
available again. Our friends at Emerald Knights
got us these boxes. These are available off

133
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:50,182
Paizo.com. You can go ahead and pick up the combat
tiers. They are now available again if you've been

134
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:51,752
wondering where the heck to get some.

135
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,007
TRAVIS: And they're out of stock.

136
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,155
MATT: Shit.

137
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:57,364
LIAM: I think Jay at Emerald Knights told me that
they're going to be in stores soonish as well, but

138
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:01,308
you can go to Paizo right now-- tweet! And go find
them.

139
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:06,763
MATT: These have saved my ass many times in games,
as you've seen. Highly recommended for anyone

140
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,736
who's DMing or running a game. It's awesome.

141
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,302
LIAM: Been in our game since day one.

142
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:13,419
MARISHA: I remember when I got those for you when
they were still prototypes in a little white box.

143
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,866
MATT: Yeah, they were in a little standard
cardboard box. You were like, this looks like it

144
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,671
should work. Saved my ass.

145
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:24,669
LIAM: And Laura and I are in this really cool game
called Lone Echo by Ready at Dawn.

146
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,805
LAURA: That's the guys that did The Order.

147
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:30,455
LIAM: We both play AI.

148
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:31,800
LAURA: We're computers.

149
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,917
LIAM: Yes. Very calm the whole time.

150
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,643
LAURA: That's right. We'll help you out.

151
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:38,304
TRAVIS: (snoring)

152
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:42,560
LAURA: Which is cool. It's VR. It's really badass,
so check it out.

153
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,626
MATT: That's great. Well cool, thank you guys for
the update. What you got, Sam?

154
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:48,413
SAM: No, I got nothing.

155
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:52,924
MATT: Well then, without further ado--

156
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:55,082
LAURA: Aw, my little Trinket dice bag isn't here.

157
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,073
TRAVIS: Nobody cares but you.

158
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:59,644
LAURA: I think it's still in the thing.

159
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:02,402
MATT: So to announce that her bag isn't here,
we're going to take a moment--

160
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,563
LAURA: Sorry. I'll go and get it during the
credits.

161
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:10,005
MATT: There you go. And that being said, guys,
let's go ahead and bring this down into tonight's

162
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:14,437
episode of Critical Role.

163
00:10:14,437 --> 00:11:44,223
[dramatic music]

164
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:51,618
MATT: And welcome back, everybody. Last we left
off, Vox Machina had been finding their way

165
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:58,235
through the realms to talk with various deities in
hopes of getting information, and perhaps a

166
00:11:58,235 --> 00:12:04,780
blessing or two, to aid them in their coming
battle against Vecna, the intent-to-ascend entity,

167
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:13,299
the long-missing and recently returned archlich
that plagued the end of the Age of Arcanum. You

168
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:20,654
have since discovered the location of his rebirth,
followed into the Shadowfell, through the city of

169
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:28,159
Thar Amphala, took down his tower of Entropis, did
battle, and nearly fell. You escaped in time, and

170
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,502
in this recovery period have been seeking out
information on how to stop him before this

171
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,618
ascension occurs, and by what tools necessary.

172
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:43,191
You've traveled to the Blessed Fields of Elysium,
where you met Pike's deity, the Everlight,

173
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:48,481
Sarenrae, where she received her blessing. You
made your way to the Fortress of the Sun, where

174
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:55,021
you met with the Dawnfather Pelor, took his
challenge, and received his blessing. You were

175
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:59,879
then given information about the whereabouts of
Ioun, the Knowing Goddess, and the domain of

176
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:07,612
knowledge, who had been hidden away since her
wounding during the Calamity. The key to her realm

177
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:15,332
was apparently hidden within not an object, but an
individual. Given loose information about the

178
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:21,240
whereabouts of this individual, you tracked down a
small home in the forested regions outside the

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,940
Pools of Wittebak in the Cliffkeep Mountains.

180
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,551
There, you spoke with this individual, this Sprigg
the Obnoxious, and then were immediately assailed

181
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:35,618
by a number of assassins sent by the Whispered
One, Vecna, apparently keeping watch on your

182
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:44,774
current location and able to send such groups of
assassins with vast haste. You did battle, managed

183
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:50,144
to save the life of Sprigg the Obnoxious, and
through conversation, unveiled that he was indeed

184
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,980
a key to this realm.

185
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,732
Keyleth, by entwining your hands with the rest of
the party and focusing on this strange magical

186
00:13:57,732 --> 00:14:02,406
essence hidden within Sprigg's form, you completed
your Plane Shift spell. You found yourself

187
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:12,484
suddenly within a dimension of an endless library,
shelves of winding books and tomes that spiral

188
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:22,559
beyond sight. In the midst of this amazing
atmosphere, a voice called you to a central

189
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:30,632
portion of the chamber. There, it seems, you've
come across the Knowing Mistress, Ioun herself,

190
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,812
there awaiting your arrival.

191
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,493
LAURA: Did we see her?

192
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,846
MATT: You did.

193
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:38,024
LAURA: Okay. Is she old or young? I can't
remember.

194
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:43,454
MATT: I'm going to go over this. Going to get you
in a space. Something to bring us back into the

195
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:44,742
moment.

196
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:55,573
So you glance around, your vision darting from
shelf to stack, the dark-lit areas empty of

197
00:14:55,573 --> 00:15:01,066
anything but empty vessels carrying books, until
you see it. The shelves have stopped ahead to

198
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:07,057
reveal a circular common area within the library
where the ground domes downward, an 80-foot

199
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:14,749
concave pit of cushions and tables all standing at
odd angles without sliding, holding tea cups and

200
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:21,246
writing implements against gravity as you know it.
Long spiralling streams of silver, blue and grey

201
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:26,895
silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is
beyond your sight, the material resting in gentle

202
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:34,707
piles amongst the cushions-- sorry, microphone--
against the cushions. Sitting within the center of

203
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:42,957
the dome, no larger than a normal person, is an
older woman of long, wavy silver hair. Her olive

204
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:48,093
skin is somewhat weathered with wrinkles but the
warmth of her smile and her vibrant purple eyes

205
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:53,269
put you at ease. Her blue and white robes tumble
out from her form in tendrils of parchment that

206
00:15:53,269 --> 00:16:00,122
snake through the pillows like roots of a giant
tree. This is the Mistress, and she beckons you

207
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:01,593
forward.

208
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:11,205
SAM: We step forward. Are we on the edge of the
bowl? Is she in the bowl and we're on the edge of

209
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:12,098
the bowl?

210
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:14,269
MATT: Yeah. You guys are on the edge of it. She's
in the very center of it.

211
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:15,975
SAM: Are we going to go into the bowl?

212
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,082
LAURA: Are we allowed?

213
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:19,116
MATT: Nothing seems to be holding you back.

214
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:36,049
DARIN: O Ioun, O goddess of knowledge, O lord who
knows all. You know. But I don't. Let me ask you a

215
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:42,052
question. And you'll see I didn't phrase that as a
question because I know how gods work, and that

216
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:48,559
probably would have been my question and then I
might as well have just talked to a turnip. Which

217
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:55,758
I've done. Found it pleasant. That being said,
this is my question. The next thing out of my

218
00:16:55,758 --> 00:17:01,991
mouth is going to be my question. Why did you
choose me to be your key? I'm nothing. I'm a

219
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:06,584
coward. Why would you ever choose me?

220
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:13,400
MATT: She opens her arms as you stand at the edge
of this domed precipice, and you watch as the

221
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,295
tendrils unfurl, pulling back a bit, revealing
small pathways to walk down toward her. Her arms

222
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:22,844
open in a welcoming motion.

223
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:25,060
LAURA: I'll walk forward.

224
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,455
TALIESIN: I'm walking in there.

225
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,549
SAM: Take a tumble.

226
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:42,158
MATT: "The purpose in choosing you, Sprigg, was,
as with all the other keys I've chosen before you,

227
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:58,892
"an unlikely choice. You were at odds with many of
my outlooks, but I saw within you, still, the seed

228
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:11,553
"of the seeker of knowledge. So in that balance, I
found a proper vessel. Someone who at once would

229
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:20,338
"not be the choice that I would make to hide my
key, but a person not beyond the realm of

230
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:24,013
"redemption within the domain that I look over."

231
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:25,780
DARIN: Thank you.

232
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:33,462
MATT: "Now, come. Please, sit. You've come a long
way. I'm curious as to what your reasons are for

233
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:40,225
"coming to me at this hour and I wish to see if my
assumptions are correct. Sit."

234
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:43,860
LAURA: You don't know already?

235
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:51,184
DARIN: Well, the goddess of knowledge is implied
in the title. Not insulting anyone. Knock knock.

236
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:56,429
MATT: "Who's there?"

237
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,359
DARIN: You would know.

238
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,929
MATT: You watch as her stoic expression curls into
a smile and her head falls back a bit to a small

239
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:17,990
chuckle. (chuckles) "Humor is perhaps a bit thin
in these walls as of late. It's nice to have a

240
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,492
"laugh. Thank you."

241
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,666
LIAM: Who was it, though?

242
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,446
DARIN: It was me the whole time.

243
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,916
MATT: "It was Larkin, my friend."

244
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,707
LAURA: Oh shit.

245
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,626
LIAM: She knows everything.

246
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,128
TRAVIS: Larkin!

247
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:33,939
DARIN: I don't know who that is.

248
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,554
TRAVIS: Many don't.

249
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:37,686
DARIN: Well said.

250
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:47,083
SAM: O mighty Ioun, we are here to ask you for
help, for a great danger. You might already know

251
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:54,453
this, but a great danger has befallen the world.
There is one who has come from another plane to

252
00:19:54,453 --> 00:20:01,584
become a god himself, Vecna. For all we know, he
may already have achieved godhood, but he's well

253
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,246
on his path.

254
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:10,149
MATT: "I know much about this individual you speak
and I had assumed this was the reason for your arrival."

255
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:13,552
LAURA: Do you know if he's been successful?

256
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:24,669
MATT: "I do not. I've not sensed any change in the
cosmetology of the world. Cosmology, even."

257
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:26,950
Cosmetology.

258
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,550
TRAVIS: I thought that was hair and makeup--

259
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:36,992
MATT: That's a different word. Her domains expand
beyond just knowledge, guys. Hence the unfurling.

260
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:39,853
TRAVIS: I've been thinking about getting some
highlights for this beard.

261
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:41,183
LIAM: It's Frenchie.

262
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:43,884
(laughter)

263
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:46,003
TRAVIS: (singing) Beauty school dropout.

264
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:59,103
MATT: "But no. You see, this Vecna is in direct
opposition to what I represent, and I believe has

265
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:05,831
"taken some precautions to keep from my distant
sight, so while I have assumptions and what

266
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:11,886
"information makes its way to me, there is a bit of
relying on you to fill in the gaps."

267
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:14,193
TALIESIN: What do you wish to know?

268
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:26,715
MATT: "Well. Do you intend to return to face this
entity, or have you chosen or found champions in

269
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:31,655
"Exandria who would rise up against this
individual?"

270
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:34,307
LAURA: We didn't even realize that was an option.

271
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:36,276
TALIESIN: Hadn't occurred to us.

272
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:39,511
MARISHA: Wow. Maybe that's very self-centered of
us, now that I think about it.

273
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,448
LAURA: We intend to face him down ourselves.

274
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:42,801
TRAVIS: We want to fight.

275
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,799
MARISHA: We're heading his direction no matter
what.

276
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,588
MATT: "Do you think you have the strength required
to do this?"

277
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:56,510
SAM: We're gathering the strength right now. Some
among us have already-- the one who's making weird

278
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,433
faces has already sworn allegiance to another
god.

279
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,335
TRAVIS: Hashtag blessed.

280
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:14,756
MATT: Her eyes close for a minute and she nods.
"The coming fight does indeed warrant the aid that

281
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:20,438
"these journeys would muster and I can see the
touch of my brethren on you already." And she

282
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:24,457
motions towards Vax and Vex and Pike.

283
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:32,141
TALIESIN: Even with these gods, there is still
much doubt as to our success. We are not certain.

284
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,215
We are not sure.

285
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:43,068
TRAVIS: We fought once, and if this is a broom
motion, we were just getting swooped. Swept. What

286
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:47,247
is it? Swiffered.

287
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:52,359
LAURA: Pelor mentioned something about the Prime
Trammels?

288
00:22:52,359 --> 00:23:04,710
MATT: "I was wondering if that would surface.
Well, if you are indeed here seeking my gift, know

289
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:12,666
"that I do not grant it lightly. For those who are
not already claimed--" She glances around the rest

290
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:29,330
of the group. "Grog Strongjaw. Just being within
my realm is of near-painful discomfort to you. For

"that I apologize and can see you are not to be my
vessel."

292
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:36,078
LAURA: It's okay, Grog.

293
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:44,419
TRAVIS: Oh. What a roller coaster. I was going up
and then going back down. Thank you for your gaze,

294
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,404
my lady.

295
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:51,743
LIAM: Grog just invented amusement park rides.

296
00:23:51,743 --> 00:24:03,854
MATT: "Keyleth of Zephrah, you have been carved
from empathy and acceptance. While you do indeed

297
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:16,831
"pursue understanding, my gifts find little
purchase on your path of responsibility.

"Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de
Rolo III--"

299
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:23,638
SAM: (whispering) She knows everything.

300
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:36,846
MATT: "You have always been a student of knowledge
and a seeker of truths. I am fond of your hunger

301
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:48,666
"for understanding, but you do keep your secrets
and are selfish with your discoveries, still. You

"have much growing to do.

303
00:24:54,181 --> 00:25:04,850
"Scanlan Shorthalt, you are a buffoon. At least,
that is the facade you craft and display to the

"world while you weave tales of the experiences
around you and share your stories with any who'd

their hidden places and shout them to any who

306
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:33,746
"would listen and inspire the lost to find purpose.
You hold the blade of the White Duke and walk a

"parallel path. You are a storyteller, and I am the
keeper of all stories. I shall task you with my

"challenge."

309
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:58,567
SAM: Not to question your infinite knowledge and
judgment, but my stories are more of little bar

310
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:05,554
room tales and silly poems to pass the time. I
would hardly call them epic histories of

311
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:06,785
civilization.

312
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:09,623
MATT: "For now, perhaps."

313
00:26:09,623 --> 00:26:16,252
DARIN: We're all stories in the end. Just make
sure yours is a good one.

314
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:22,955
MATT: "Do you think that your compatriots would
have the strength now to rise against such a

"scourge had you not been there to lift their
spirits with these tales?"

316
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:32,583
LAURA: It's true, Scanlan.

317
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,631
SAM: I'm really powerful.

318
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:35,721
LAURA: You are.

319
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:38,014
LIAM: And humble.

320
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:41,704
SAM: It's my best asset.

321
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:43,973
LIAM: And deeper than you let on.

322
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:45,314
TRAVIS: And the cube.

323
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,554
LAURA: (laughing) And a cube.

324
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:53,445
MATT: She glances over at you with a knowing
look.

325
00:26:53,445 --> 00:27:09,411
SAM: If you have faith in me, I will have faith in
you and trust you and your knowledge. And I will

326
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:12,517
try to complete any task you ask of me.

327
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:24,586
MATT: "Then let the challenge be placed before
you. Scanlan Shorthalt! Somewhere within this

328
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:33,679
"library lies the book that contains the
Incantation of Isolation, the arcane rite that

329

"banished the Chained Oblivion. You have one hour
to retrieve it. Your friends can help you, but you

incorrect, then I shall await another warrior of

"before you. Return to me when you are certain
you've found it. Your challenge begins now." And

333
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:18,031
with that, her entire body vanishes in a gust of
wind. All the little tendrils of paper flutter out

334
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:23,244
and come to rest within the dome, and you look up
and see the immensity of this library.

335
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,875
TRAVIS: Incantation of Isolation?

336
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,388
LAURA: Incantation of Isolation.

337
00:28:28,388 --> 00:28:30,157
MARISHA: I speak Primordial.

338
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:32,971
TRAVIS: We don't know the name of the book, right?
So we can't Locate Object.

339
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:35,534
SAM: There's a tome that contains the incantation
of what?

340
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:37,053
TRAVIS, LAURA, MARISHA, and SAM: Isolation.

341
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:39,261
MARISHA: Which was what they used--

342
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:44,305
LAURA: What is with this pencil? It was dipped in
ketchup or something.

343
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,193
MATT: Don't use that pencil. Use one of your own.

344
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,866
LAURA: But it needs to be sharpened.

345
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:50,719
MATT: Just push really hard.

346
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:55,749
TRAVIS: How do we do that? Sprigg!

347
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:56,983
DARIN: Yes?

348
00:28:56,983 --> 00:29:01,217
TRAVIS: Do you have a tome at your place that has
the Incantation of Isolation?

349
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:06,223
DARIN: Not anymore. Burny-burny, ashy-ashy.
Bye-bye.

350
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:07,894
LAURA: Do you remember the name of it?

351
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,287
DARIN: No.

352
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:15,734
LAURA: I'm going to try casting Locate Object and
cast it on the tome that contains the Incantation

353
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:18,052
of Isolation. Try it. Why not.

354
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:22,500
TRAVIS: Can it work like that?

355
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,556
LAURA: I don't know.

356
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:29,344
LIAM: An object known to you as long as you have
seen it up close within 30 feet at least once.

357
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:32,103
LAURA: Oh. Really?

358
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,863
LIAM: Yeah. It's a spell I have now.

359
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:37,355
MATT: Describe or name an object that is familiar
to you. You sense the direction of the object's

360
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:40,669
location, so as long as the object is within a
thousand feet of you.

361
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:41,494
LAURA: Okay.

362
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:49,089
MATT: So you cast the spell. And you think about
it and you concentrate. Nothing.

363
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:56,089
LAURA: I'm going to kneel down and pray to the
Dawnfather, since he was one of the ones that

364
00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:01,286
helped fight the Chained Oblivion, to see if he
could guide us at all.

365
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:07,732
MATT: Okay. You close your eyes and focus and you
begin to beseech the knowledge and wisdom of the

366
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:12,822
Dawnfather. Two minutes pass with no answer.

367
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:21,192
LIAM: During that two minutes, I'm going to scan
the room. Is there any design or purpose to the

368
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:23,883
layout of the room? Anything that stands out
besides books.

369
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:31,619
MATT: As you glance around the room quickly, you
see there are probably two dozen bookshelf aisle

370
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:38,478
openings all around this central dome area. You
begin to look around. You don't see any specific

371
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:41,150
signs. Go ahead and roll a perception check.

372
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,625
LIAM: Going to use my last Luck for this sleep
cycle. Natural 20.

373
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:55,087
MATT: Glancing about, you don't see any signs on
the books. You do notice, however, there are

374
00:30:55,087 --> 00:31:02,859
hundreds of those somewhat spectral keepers of the
library that are moving tomes through and

375
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:08,690
organizing and relocating things, just like you saw
when you first entered.

376
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,777
SAM: They're spectral?

377
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:12,065
MATT: They're spectral, yeah.

378
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:14,327
SAM: I'm going to go try to talk to one of them.

379
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:18,973
MATT: Okay. One of them's currently pulling books
out. You can see the basic shimmering outline of a

380
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:23,344
humanoid form, and they're taking a book off and
stacking it and finding another.

381
00:31:23,344 --> 00:31:26,523
SAM: Hello, sir. Do you have language? Can you
speak?

382
00:31:26,523 --> 00:31:29,164
MATT: He turns and looks to you for a second.

383
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:36,305
SAM: Can you help us find a book? It contains an
Incantation of Isolation.

384
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:38,419
TRAVIS: Or about the Chained Oblivion.

385
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:40,222
SAM: Or about the Chained Oblivion.

386
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:44,099
LAURA: Or about the Calamity or something.

387
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:50,821
TALIESIN: Where are the lives of those who
witnessed it?

388
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,559
MATT: It doesn't seem to be at this moment--

389
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,305
SAM: No chance.

390
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:58,767
LAURA: I'm going to hop on my broom to see if I
get a ping on my Locate Object.

391
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:08,395
SAM: Wait. Before we start flying around, what do
we know? When was this last used, this book? 886

392
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:14,301
years ago or whatever, right? 812 years ago.

393
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:15,896
LAURA: Wow, you know that?

394
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:25,927
SAM: Well, it's 812 P-whatever. PD, right? So 812
years ago. So we're looking for a very old book

395
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:30,271
that was used by Ioun? Who was it used by?

396
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:34,132
TRAVIS: Potentially. Or the Dawnfather helped seal
with Ioun.

397
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:35,571
MARISHA: Correct.

398
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:40,059
SAM: So it's some sort of a wizard's or sorcerer's
tome?

399
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:48,819
MARISHA: I have a question. Didn't one of us have
a potion or scroll of language-speaking? Didn't we

400
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:50,418
have that?

401
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:52,626
LAURA: Do any of the tomes have titles on them,
though?

402
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:56,962
MATT: Glancing about, and some of them do. They're
all in Celestial.

403
00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:59,218
TALIESIN: I'm going to read off some titles.

404
00:32:59,218 --> 00:33:00,717
MARISHA: Yeah. Primordial.

405
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:03,392
MATT: None visibly currently in Primordial.

406
00:33:03,392 --> 00:33:05,165
SAM: Is that the language they used before the--

407
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:08,428
LAURA: I feel like Celestial would be what the
Dawnfather would speak, though.

408
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:13,166
MARISHA: Celestial would be close. I would think
more close than Primordial.

409
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,231
MATT: So make an investigation check. Who else is
looking through books?

410
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:20,191
LAURA: I don't speak Celestial, so it doesn't
really matter.

411
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:22,626
MATT: Well, make separate investigation checks.

412
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,077
TALIESIN: 12.

413
00:33:24,077 --> 00:33:25,811
MARISHA: We're making investigation checks?

414
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:28,524
MATT: Anybody who's searching currently, or doing
something that involves searching through books.

415
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:29,786
LIAM: 26.

416
00:33:29,786 --> 00:33:31,047
LAURA: 21.

417
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:32,074
MARISHA: 20.

418
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:33,121
TALIESIN: 12.

419
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:34,317
MATT: Okay.

420
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:37,266
DARIN: 22.

421
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:43,313
MATT: All right. You guys begin fanning out. And
it's so overwhelming. It's so immense. There's

422
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:50,024
thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of
books within your immediate visual vicinity. And

423
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:54,251
like I said, about 150 feet beyond you, it seems
to fade into shadow and the more you walk towards

424
00:33:54,251 --> 00:34:00,526
that shadow, it reveals more books. They curve and
spiral and almost seem to intertwine into that

425
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:04,099
Escher painting-like advance towards the ceiling
you don't see.

426
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:06,096
LAURA: Does it seem like some are older than
others?

427
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:11,642
MATT: Yeah. They seem scattered. As you're going
around you find some are Celestial. The further

428
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:14,832
away from the center you get you do find some
sections that are other languages. You see some

429
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:18,778
that are in Abyssal. You don't find any that are
Primordial yet.

430
00:34:18,778 --> 00:34:23,627
TRAVIS: Scattered amongst or categorized by
language?

431
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:28,944
MATT: The ones that are nearest to the center here
are all names. They are all names of people.

432
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:31,263
LAURA: Okay.

433
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:35,081
SAM: So we need to find one that's not a name of a
person.

434
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:43,041
DARIN: Who used the Incantation of Isolation?
Perhaps if we find the book of the user, we will

435
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,813
find their spells.

436
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,563
LAURA: Was it Pelor? Does Pelor have a book?

437
00:34:46,563 --> 00:34:48,529
SAM: Are they dead?

438
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:52,225
TRAVIS: No, it continues writing, right?
Potentially, there's a book.

439
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:57,764
SAM: So there's a book that says Pelor on it? Or
Ioun. Or Dawnfather.

440
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:05,854
LIAM: Or if Vecna is a dead man. Maybe a book with
Vecna's name on it?

441
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:09,132
LAURA: I don't know why the Incantation of
Isolation would be--

442
00:35:09,132 --> 00:35:17,153
SAM: Hey, Percy, are these books arranged in any
order? Chronological, name, anything? Oh, you

443
00:35:17,153 --> 00:35:18,502
didn't see anything when you looked?

444
00:35:18,502 --> 00:35:21,127
MATT: You're having a hard time really finding any
pattern to the books.

445
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:23,031
TALIESIN: Fuck. There's no pattern.

446
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:28,677
LAURA: Can I look at the bookbinding, though? Do
some books seem like they fall apart more?

447
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:39,640
MATT: Yeah, there's a wide variety of ages and
types. The sense of the pattern of the sections of

448
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,135
books: some of them seem to be clustered together
and some of them seem to have similar colorations

449
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:47,854
the further into the side. The further out you get
from this the more scattered they get. It's almost

450
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,979
like the organization begins from the center and
either they're reorganized for reasons that are

451
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:56,545
beyond your comprehension. You get the sense as
you begin to hear this slight grinding-- you got

452
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:57,591
the natural 20?

453
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:58,880
LIAM: Earlier, yeah.

454
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,203
MATT: Yep. So you've been glancing about and
looking about. You pick up the slight sound

455
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:09,600
(grinding). And you look up and you can see some
of these shelves coming down from the

456
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,910
ceiling that are stopping about 30 feet above you are
sliding and moving. The actual library seems to

457
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:21,312
have some sort of slow rearranging movement to
it.

458
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:25,120
LIAM: Pop out the wings. Go up.

459
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:33,738
MARISHA: I start looking at the ceiling. Is there
any type of-- what are those? The observatory.

460
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:38,667
What are those called, Percy? The celestial, tell
you the stars thing?

461
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:43,920
TALIESIN: Oh, like some sort of astrolabe or
something like that?

462
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:51,910
MARISHA: Yeah. Astrolabe? You know those big
rotating things you can put in the year and the

463
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,997
month in the calendar.

464
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:56,753
MATT: Oh, right. Nothing you've seen so far. Make
a perception check.

465
00:36:56,753 --> 00:37:05,817
MARISHA: What am I looking for? Perception check?
That's good. 17. 30 total.

466
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:09,381
MATT: Looking around your current vicinity, you
see nothing like that.

467
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:13,850
TALIESIN: Are there any books in the bowl?

468
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,961
MATT: There are a handful on one of the tables
that are around.

469
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,918
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at what's in
the bowl.

470
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:23,528
TRAVIS: I jump in and start throwing pillows
around. Did she leave anything cool behind?

471
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:28,338
MATT: As you're throwing the pillows, some of them
fling off to the side, and you uncover a couple of

472
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:29,624
empty cups of tea.

473
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:30,728
TRAVIS: I drink them.

474
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:37,827
MATT: All right. You get some stale
library-temperature tea. You do find a couple of

475
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:39,748
large books on one of the nearby tables.

476
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:41,937
TRAVIS: Ooh! I found a large book on one of the
nearby tables.

477
00:37:41,937 --> 00:37:43,903
TALIESIN: I'm going to read the names of these
books.

478
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:52,723
MATT: Okay. One of them, the name is Jaina Kumor.
Doesn't ring a bell. And another one appears to be

479
00:37:52,723 --> 00:38:01,992
a book that pertains to the attempts of creating
alchemical transitions from one base element to

480
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:06,835
another. Essentially, what was the attempt at a
philosopher's stone-like object long ago and the

481
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:10,941
various trials and tribulations and unfortunate
deaths that occurred because of it.

482
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,778
SAM: Interesting.

483
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:16,325
LIAM: Do I see anything different 100, 150 feet
up? Does the change in perspective on the room

484
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,688
below reveal anything?

485
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:21,923
MATT: The change in perspective shows you one, you
do finally see a ceiling and it's like two

486
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:26,630
mirrored libraries in the ceiling and the floor.
There are bookshelves that come up and stop and

487
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,134
there are bookshelves that come down and stop, and
you look up and you can see there are other

488
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:34,279
spirits hanging upside down walking along the
pathways above, as well.

489
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:40,404
SAM: Wait, so it's like a mirror image, the top
and bottom?

490
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:45,273
MATT: Yeah, but they're not exact mirror images.
There's just a bottom and a top part of the

491
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:46,886
library.

492
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:55,666
SAM: What if that line is the demarcation between
pre-Divergence and post-Divergence or something

493
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,521
like that?

494
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:58,204
LAURA: That's cool. Go up and in.

495
00:38:58,204 --> 00:38:59,479
SAM: I can't.

496
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,507
LAURA: Here, get on the broom, Scanlan. We'll fly
up.

497
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:06,375
MATT: All right. So Scanlan, you jump on her
broom. (whooshing) You fly up. Who's taking a

498
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,110
look? Make an investigation check if you do.

499
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:13,948
SAM: I'm going to take a look, but I'm going to
pull out my Ioun stone and clutch it in my hand

500
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:19,507
and close my eyes and pray on it for a second.
Hope that guides me in some way.

501
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:20,724
MATT: Roll a religion check.

502
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:25,194
SAM: Religion check. Okay, well, that's terrible.

503
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:26,392
TRAVIS: Luck!

504
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:37,585
SAM: I don't have Luck. I can inspire myself. I
will inspire myself with a little song. (singing)

505
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:45,275
Scanlancito, he's got tiny feet-oh, but he likes
to cast spells, he does it with his beat-oh. When

506
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:50,304
you go to sleep-oh, better check your sheet-ohs,
because after he eats-ohs, he likes to take a

507
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,507
shit-oh!

508
00:39:51,507 --> 00:39:53,197
(laughter)

509
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:57,333
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Are you fucking kidding me?
What the hell, man?

510
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,339
LIAM: Get that book.

511
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,591
MATT: Yeah, You earned that d12.

512
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:08,506
SAM: That's a 12. So that brings it up to 21.

513
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:13,501
MATT: Okay. This is your investigation check to
search about. Oh no, that's your religion check.

514
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:19,120
All right. Clutching the Ioun stone, as you sing
this song, the stone glows ever so faintly in your

515
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,140
hand and you glance up and you can see about ten
of the various spectral librarians that are

516
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,331
wandering have stopped and they're all looking at
you. Seemingly temporarily distracted or entranced

517
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:31,430
by the song.

518
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,051
LAURA: Let's go try to talk to one.

519
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:34,603
SAM: Okay. Whoa!

520
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:39,585
MATT: You land next to all the librarians and as
soon as you land, there's like a moment of quiet

521
00:40:39,585 --> 00:40:41,779
and they all go about their business again.

522
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:48,681
SAM: On behalf of the Mistress Ioun, I speak in
her name. And I'll hold up the stone.

523
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:51,069
LAURA: It's always good to lie.

524
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:58,598
SAM: Well she tasked me; it's not a lie! She
tasked me with this. We seek a book. We would love

525
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:05,726
some help, and it contains the Incantation of
Isolation. Maybe about 812 years old-ish. Maybe

526
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:06,920
813?

527
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,407
MATT: No one seems to be paying attention to your
words.

528
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:12,471
LAURA and TALIESIN: Maybe sing it.

529
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,972
SAM: I have to sing it?

530
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,507
LIAM: Pull out Mythcarver.

531
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:17,172
LAURA: Pull out Mythcarver and sing.

532
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:21,063
SAM: Oh, okay. I pull out a sword. (sword
unsheathing)

533
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:25,257
LAURA: Just sing like it's a microphone.

534
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:40,353
SAM: Okay. (singing) Just take a look, it's in a
book, the Scanlan rainbow. I can read anything.

535
00:41:40,353 --> 00:41:48,053
MATT: You watch as the same librarians all of a
sudden stop what they're doing and turn back

536
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:53,810
towards you. The sword is vibrating and ringing;
it's expanding the notes of your song, as is the

537
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,287
nature of Mythcarver. You seem to have their
attention.

538
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:59,760
LAURA: Now ask. Now sing and question.

539
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,361
MATT: It's been about 20 minutes, by the way.

540
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:03,520
LAURA: Oh Jesus. I mean, Ioun.

541
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:14,725
SAM: (singing) I sing to you in desperation. I'm
looking for a Tome of Isolation. We need to find a

542
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:24,237
tome, so we can go home and kill a guy named
Vecna. It would really make us... Nothing rhymes

543
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,946
with Vecna.

544
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:32,322
MATT: Roll a performance check.

545
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:33,915
SAM: 29.

546
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:41,820
MATT: You watch as the librarians gather. They're
up above you and they gather closely to you as

547
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,663
you're singing this song and as you finish your
final verse they all look a little confused, and

548
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:49,762
they all begin to shift as one unit around the
edge of one of the bookcases.

549
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:52,183
MARISHA: Scanlan! (yells) Scanlan!

550
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:53,228
SAM: (yells) What?

551
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:54,532
LAURA: We have an earring.

552
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:56,319
MARISHA: Oh, right. Sorry.

553
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,021
SAM: It's a library; keep quiet.

554
00:42:58,021 --> 00:43:04,642
MARISHA: Your stories. It's your storytelling.
Keep telling the story about the Calamity. Maybe

555
00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:07,170
if you talk about Vecna some more and what
happened.

556
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,173
SAM: I don't know my history.

557
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,342
MATT: Roll a history check.

558
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:17,821
DARIN: Tell him "heck, nah" rhymes with Vecna, if
it helps at all.

559
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:19,444
SAM: 23.

560
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:28,332
MATT: Vecna didn't have too much involvement in
the Calamity directly. The Calamity mainly

561
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:34,438
involved the gods battling. It involved the
Chained Oblivion. It involved the sealing of that

562
00:43:34,438 --> 00:43:40,515
deity during one of the major battles of the
Calamity. Those are elements of the history that

563
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:42,420
pertain to the Calamity that you recall.

564
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,622
LAURA: We're following the little surge of
spectrals.

565
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:51,075
SAM: Okay. I'm just going to keep talking, I
guess. (rapping) The book we're looking for is

566
00:43:51,075 --> 00:44:00,030
fraught with insanity, It dates back to the time
of Calamity. It's about a guy with oblivion

567
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,737
chains. You know his name.

568
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:06,588
(laughter)

569
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:10,453
SAM: (rapping) What's his name, yo? (speaking) I
got nothing.

570
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:16,858
LAURA: (singing) He's the Chained Oblivion. His name is the
Chained Oblivion.

571
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:19,736
TRAVIS: (singing) And there's a million things he
hasn't done.

572
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,278
MATT: (singing) Because he's sealed.

573
00:44:21,278 --> 00:44:23,937
MATT, LAURA, TALIESIN and MARISHA: (singing)
Because he's sealed.

574
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:26,667
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. Lin-Manuel just turned it off.

575
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:34,130
MATT: Okay. Sorry. All right, so as you continue
to sing, with each beat, each name that's

576
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:42,873
mentioned that deals with the Calamity and the
Chained Oblivion, you watch as their pace seems to

577
00:44:42,873 --> 00:44:49,252
quicken a bit, and then as the singing slows they
begin to slow down again. There's a specific

578
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:56,875
correlation and drive between your storytelling
and your singing, and apparently the drive in

579
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,516
which they're pushing towards their--

580
00:44:58,516 --> 00:45:00,245
LAURA: Keep telling the story.

581
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:04,907
DARIN: Tell them the song about Vecna just might
wreck ya. It's close; it doesn't work.

582
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:06,420
SAM: Okay, Sprigg, I got it.

583
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,550
MATT: You hear Sprigg yelling from down below, as
he doesn't have an earring.

584
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:15,133
SAM: (singing) If we don't act soon Vecna might
just wreck ya. (speaking) I got it in there for

585
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:16,032
you.

586
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:19,452
DARIN: Thanks. Tell them about your neck, ma.

587
00:45:19,452 --> 00:45:21,375
SAM: Oh yeah. Wait, what?

588
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:29,112
DARIN: If you're discussing your neck to your
mother, you would-- what? Oh, right. People get

589
00:45:29,112 --> 00:45:30,449
paid for that.

590
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:33,215
SAM: (whispers) Oh my god.

591
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:38,629
DARIN: Call back to earlier discussion. And nobody
knows.

592
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:40,697
LIAM: (singing) God I hope I get it.

593
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:51,750
SAM: (singing) The book is eight centuries old, or
so I'm told. It's fraught with mystery. It's

594
00:45:51,750 --> 00:46:01,397
teeming with history. So please listen to me and
don't kiss me because I really need this book

595
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:03,150
right now.

596
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,552
MATT: Roll another performance check.

597
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:07,157
MARISHA: Yes. Come on.

598
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:09,618
SAM: No. 22.

599
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:15,113
MATT: 22. Okay. They continue to push at a brisk
pace and you watch as other of the spectral

600
00:46:15,113 --> 00:46:19,309
librarians begin to gather into this group and is
now a cluster of about 25 of them that are snaking

601
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:24,927
around these bookcases and traveling at a pretty
fair pace. Which once was walking pace, and then

602
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:28,620
went to a jogging pace, they're now darting
through. And they're leading you quickly away from

603
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,875
the center of the library where everyone else
seems to be clustered.

604
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:35,718
So the two of you are following and swooshing
behind them, you're going over and around

605
00:46:35,718 --> 00:46:39,583
bookcases. Some of the bookcases you see have
giant holes in the center and you can dart through

606
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:45,392
and dive past. The speed is increasing to the
point where the wind is starting to kick up in

607
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:50,290
your hair and you're amazed at the speed of these
librarians and the fact that they're being driven

608
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:56,347
by your very song, and also the fact that you have
no idea how far away the rest of your friends are

609
00:46:56,347 --> 00:47:02,219
in this library, and this library seems to just go
on and on and on.

610
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:08,734
You continue forward for another ten minutes or
so, so you've hit just over the 30-minute mark at

611
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:17,063
this point, and you feel this little pulse from
the stone. Do you continue to inspire?

612
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:24,836
SAM: I will do one more. I hope it works. I'll
recite a poem. This little gnomey went to the

613
00:47:24,836 --> 00:47:32,355
heavens. This little gnomey wants to go home. This
little gnomey is looking for a book. This little

614
00:47:32,355 --> 00:47:43,228
gnomey is trusting Ioun. This little gnomey wants
to go wee-wee-wee-wee all the way to this tome.

615
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:48,555
(cheering)

616
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:52,148
MATT: Roll a performance check with advantage.

617
00:47:52,148 --> 00:47:53,106
SAM: Natural 20.

618
00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:54,396
(cheering)

619
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:56,298
MATT: Didn't even need it.

620
00:47:56,298 --> 00:47:59,341
MARISHA: Hashtag blessed.

621
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:08,402
MATT: So the speed is dangerous to the point where
as trying to follow them you almost lose sight of

622
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:14,221
them a couple of times. You being the driver of
this, I need you to go ahead and make a perception

623
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:16,287
check to make sure you can keep them in your
vision.

624
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:17,897
TRAVIS: Damn, Scanlan got bars, y'all.

625
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:18,981
LAURA: 22.

626
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:23,080
MATT: 22. Okay. That's enough. You nearly lose
them a few times and you're like (grunts). You

627
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,538
have to take a second and listen out there and you
see a faint glow of their spectral form in the

628
00:48:26,538 --> 00:48:34,056
distance. There! And so you continue to give
chase. Then eventually, at about the 40-minute

629
00:48:34,056 --> 00:48:39,651
mark or so, you come to the outside. What's
interesting, too, is a lot of these bookcases are

630
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:43,020
made of different materials. Some of them are dark
wood, light wood, some of them are metal and

631
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:50,886
various substances. You come to, on the ceiling,
jammed in, a bookcase, but it's made of a very

632
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:59,813
dark slate gray metal. And it has chains across it
and a series of locks on it.

633
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:02,201
LAURA: (whispers) I had a feeling it would be a
locked bookcase.

634
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:05,919
MATT: And you see them, all the librarians are
clustered and circled around it right now.

635
00:49:05,919 --> 00:49:08,230
LAURA: (singing) Can they open it up?

636
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,463
SAM: Oh. (singing) Can you open it up?

637
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:13,421
TRAVIS: Find somebody that can pick them locks.

638
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:14,896
MATT: There's no response from them.

639
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:16,431
SAM: Wait, they can pick books.

640
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:17,777
MATT: They can pick up books.

641
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:20,772
LAURA: Vax, can you hear me?

642
00:49:20,772 --> 00:49:22,967
LIAM: I don't know. 500 feet.

643
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:26,977
MATT: You've been traveling for a while. He
doesn't hear you.

644
00:49:26,977 --> 00:49:29,013
LAURA: I can try to pick it. I can try.

645
00:49:29,013 --> 00:49:32,643
MARISHA: Come on, multiclassing into that rogue
now.

646
00:49:32,643 --> 00:49:38,040
MATT: All right, so you fumble around and quickly
pull out your thieves' tools. All right, go ahead

647
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,328
and roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier and
your proficiency bonus.

648
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:43,026
LAURA: My proficiency bonus.

649
00:49:43,026 --> 00:49:44,585
SAM: I'm going to inspire her.

650
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:45,846
MATT: Okay.

651
00:49:45,846 --> 00:49:55,463
SAM: (singing) I'm so vain. I probably think this
song is about me. I'm so vain.

652
00:49:55,463 --> 00:49:58,869
LAURA: Yeah, I got a one on your inspiration.
Thanks for that. But I rolled well so it doesn't

653
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:07,197
matter. Hopefully. 19 plus my dexterity modifier
plus my proficiency bonus? 30.

654
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,575
SAM: Wow!

655
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:09,927
LIAM: She rolled a 19.

656
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,018
MATT: The DC was 30.

657
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:15,261
SAM: It was the inspiration!

658
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:17,581
LAURA: No, plus inspiration was 31!

659
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,666
MATT: Yeah, the DC on that was 30.

660
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:21,760
LAURA: Oh, jeebies.

661
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,467
SAM: There are DCs up to 30?!

662
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:27,402
MATT: Yeah. 30's considered nearly impossible.

663
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:29,015
MARISHA: We're badasses now.

664
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:31,937
TRAVIS: What happens when you say that shit?!

665
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:37,288
MARISHA: No, I'm just saying the difficulties are
going to get harder.

666
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:39,783
LAURA: Oh, in god realm it will be harder.

667
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:48,394
MATT: So as you work your way down the chain, you
get through a few of them, and there's one big

668
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:57,322
lock in the center that's bolted into a big double
doorway, or hinged opening to this bookcase. This

669
00:50:57,322 --> 00:51:07,329
one takes you a few moments to get into.
(clicking) It snaps your lockpick. As soon as you

670
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:12,496
hear the (tink), your heart sinks, but you still
have a little bit of leverage and you push forward

671
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:18,324
on the broken pick, and it's just enough to get
the tumbler to click in. Your lockpick is busted;

672
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:21,865
you're going to have to get a new one. However, it
does open on one side.

673
00:51:21,865 --> 00:51:25,057
LAURA: That's the hardest lock I've ever picked, I
swear!

674
00:51:25,057 --> 00:51:31,738
MATT: You open, and you can see about 25 different
books of different shapes, sizes, colors, all

675
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:35,017
ancient that are all in this small locked
section.

676
00:51:35,017 --> 00:51:39,488
LAURA: Are any of the spectrals looking at one,
specifically?

677
00:51:39,488 --> 00:51:41,570
MATT: No, they are all just at the side.

678
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,187
LAURA: Can you do your Ioun Stone?

679
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:44,677
SAM: Sure, I'll blacklight it.

680
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:47,351
LAURA: Does it glow for anything in particular?

681
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:53,808
MATT: You take your Ioun Stone, and as you go
across, it doesn't seem to have an effect.

682
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:58,060
SAM: I'm going to quickly scan the books to see if
any of them look particularly old.

683
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,697
LAURA: Can I read any of them?

684
00:51:59,697 --> 00:52:01,646
MATT: What languages do you know?

685
00:52:01,646 --> 00:52:04,142
LAURA: Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal, and
Draconic.

686
00:52:04,142 --> 00:52:05,779
MATT: And you?

687
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:10,555
SAM: Not much! Gnome, Marquesian, and Common.

688
00:52:10,555 --> 00:52:18,462
MATT: There are about ten of them you cannot read.
There is one book that has nothing on the spine;

689
00:52:18,462 --> 00:52:23,439
it's blank. About five of them appear to be in
Abyssal. You, reading through them, a lot of them

690
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:31,049
talk about-- they are history books that talk about
the Lord of the Hells. There's one that speaks on

691
00:52:31,049 --> 00:52:39,717
rites and rituals of sacrifice. There is one that
talks about the annihilation of a race that no

692
00:52:39,717 --> 00:52:45,625
longers exists in the world during the Age of
Arcanum. There's one that talks about the birth of

693
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:49,707
the Rune Children. There's all these books that
all talk about different things, but nothing seems

694
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:55,355
to stand out to you as the tome you might be
looking for.

695
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:59,507
LAURA: Well, I could potentially grab all of them
and shove them in the Bag of Colding.

696
00:52:59,507 --> 00:53:04,583
SAM: And then what? How many minutes are left, and
how far are we from our friends?

697
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,607
MATT: You have about 15 minutes left and it's
about ten minutes of travel.

698
00:53:07,607 --> 00:53:11,794
SAM: We could take them all back and see if anyone
can read.

699
00:53:11,794 --> 00:53:16,474
LAURA: It seems pretty shitty, dumping them out in
a pile, but I don't know what else to do.

700
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:19,555
TRAVIS: Yeah. The spirits'll put them back.

701
00:53:19,555 --> 00:53:24,260
SAM: The one that has nothing on the binding. Can
I open that and flip through real quick?

702
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,275
LAURA: I start grabbing other ones and putting
them in the bag.

703
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:31,541
MATT: You pull out the one with nothing on it.
It's a very thin book; it's only about that wide

704
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:38,614
or so, it's a dark gray leather. It looks damaged.
Part of it's burnt and scarred on the outside.

705
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:44,981
There's no words on the cover. You open it up and
it's about four pages that are blank.

706
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:49,719
SAM: This is the thing.

707
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:55,942
LAURA: What can you do? Do you have a spell that
lets you see things? Reveals things?

708
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,090
SAM: I do not.

709
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:02,245
TRAVIS: Talk to it.

710
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:04,483
SAM: Okay, sure.

711
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:06,086
LAURA: Yeah! Sing to it or something!

712
00:54:06,086 --> 00:54:24,943
SAM: Sure. I'll sing to a book, Matt. (singing)
Read to me of times gone by. Can it be you're here

713
00:54:24,943 --> 00:54:29,709
when a bunch of gods died? (speaking) Okay. That's
all I got.

714
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:34,594
MATT: Doesn't seem to have any effect.
Doesn't seem to respond to the singing.

715
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:35,981
SAM: Don't tell anyone I sang to a book.

716
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:42,100
LAURA: You just keep singing, I'll keep taking
books. We've got not enough time.

717
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,882
MATT: It takes you about a minute to throw them
all in there haphazardly.

718
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:48,708
TRAVIS and LAURA: 25 books.

719
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,268
SAM: Let's get back.

720
00:54:50,268 --> 00:54:57,501
MATT: You guys dart back. You get low enough to
the point where you're in between the two

721
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:03,266
bookcaess. The heights vary and in some case
you're having to suddenly shift up and over to

722
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:08,374
avoid slamming into the side of the large
bookcase. You're shooting through this-- almost

723
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:14,753
like an up and down version of the Star Wars entry
to the... Death Star. Thank you, my brain's not

724
00:55:14,753 --> 00:55:15,783
working.

725
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:19,725
LAURA: My Locate Object never pinged? My
Incantation of Isolation Locate Object?

726
00:55:19,725 --> 00:55:25,966
MATT: Interestingly enough, thank you for
reminding me of that. As soon as he pulled the

727
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:31,089
book out, the one that he's holding, the one with
no text on it, it pinged.

728
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:33,698
LAURA: Oh shit, I just grabbed a bunch of books,
but that's the one!

729
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:34,780
SAM: Are you sure?

730
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:40,169
LAURA: It's got to be! Keep looking at it while
we're flying, see if you can figure it out!

731
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,872
SAM: Hold it upside down.

732
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:43,442
LAURA: Hold onto me, though, because we're going
fast.

733
00:55:43,442 --> 00:55:45,122
SAM: I'm going to listen to it.

734
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:46,850
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.

735
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:50,436
SAM: 13 plus five, 18.

736
00:55:50,436 --> 00:55:55,856
MATT: 18. As you're darting by, you're clutching
your side with your hand around her waist, reading

737
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:57,724
it. You almost lose it a couple times.

738
00:55:57,724 --> 00:56:00,680
SAM: Plus Jack of All Trades.

739
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,692
MATT: So what's the total?

740
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:03,577
SAM: 21.

741
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:12,786
MATT: 21. You get the sense that there is
something magical about it. I would say, you can't

742
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:20,659
put your finger on it, but what faint arcane
essence that you can sense from your usage of

743
00:56:20,659 --> 00:56:27,445
spells, and the feeling of releasing spells,
the charging and release of arcane energy. You get

744
00:56:27,445 --> 00:56:31,450
the sense of that release from the book. It's
almost wanting something. It's pulling something

745
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,113
very faintly.

746
00:56:33,113 --> 00:56:37,618
SAM: What spell? I don't want to hurt it!

747
00:56:37,618 --> 00:56:40,553
LAURA: Place Mythcarver on it! Place Mythcarver in
it!

748
00:56:40,553 --> 00:56:47,441
SAM: Okay. I'll place Mythcarver on it. I don't
know what to cast on a book!

749
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:48,941
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

750
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:50,751
SAM: I'll cast Friends on it.

751
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:52,905
LAURA: That was almost so bad.

752
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:54,021
MATT: You cast Friends on it?

753
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:55,008
SAM: Sure.

754
00:56:55,008 --> 00:57:01,600
MATT: Okay, as you release the cantrip, the book
seems to absorb the magic, but no reaction.

755
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,900
LAURA: 28.

756
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:07,469
MATT: 28. As you dart around the corner, one of
the shifting bookcases comes right in front of

757
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:12,609
you, and you just dart out of the way in time.
Scanlan, you barely hold on. I need you to roll a

758
00:57:12,609 --> 00:57:13,573
strength check.

759
00:57:13,573 --> 00:57:16,781
LAURA: Oh god, can I hold onto his wrist to help
out?

760
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:18,361
SAM: Not good. Strength?

761
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:21,572
MATT: This would be a strength saving throw,
yeah.

762
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:23,036
SAM: Ten.

763
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:28,963
MATT: Ten? The book's like (bouncing) and you
catch it right as it falls and you hold it in your

764
00:57:28,963 --> 00:57:30,090
hand.

765
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,496
TRAVIS: What if you write in it?

766
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:34,845
LAURA: Yeah, what if you write in it and say,
"Hey, I need the Incantation of Isolation!"

767
00:57:34,845 --> 00:57:36,665
SAM: Write in the book?

768
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:38,794
TRAVIS: Didn't you ever watch Harry Potter? He wrote
in the book and it wrote back!

769
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:40,697
SAM: No! I've never watched Harry Potter!

770
00:57:40,697 --> 00:57:42,387
TALIESIN: Who are you?!

771
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:45,253
TRAVIS: Do you have a quill? Can you write it in?
Can you write something in the book?

772
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,141
SAM: I must have a quill, right? I'm a
storyteller.

773
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:48,522
MATT: You'd have to pull it out of your pouch,
yeah.

774
00:57:48,522 --> 00:57:50,434
SAM: Okay, I'll pull out my quill.

775
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:51,481
MATT: And your inkwell?

776
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:56,057
SAM: Jesus. While we're flying? This seems like a
bad idea. This is a bad idea.

777
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:57,089
MATT: Do you want to try it?

778
00:57:57,089 --> 00:57:58,741
SAM: No! How about when we land?

779
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,641
LAURA: Did you cast Friends on it? Did it work?

780
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:04,132
SAM: No. It absorbed the spell and seemed to like
it, but nothing happened.

781
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:06,409
TRAVIS: What else can you do to imbue it with
magic?

782
00:58:06,409 --> 00:58:11,295
SAM: I have the Ioun Stone, but it doesn't do
anything.

783
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:13,529
MATT: As you're rushing, make another dexterity
saving throw.

784
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:21,647
LAURA: Jesus. Oh god. Okay. 27.

785
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:27,262
MATT: (whoosh) You yank out of the way of another
one that shifts. It's one that goes from ceiling to

786
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:32,555
floor, it's one solid bookcase that comes right in
the way. You manage to dart around the side. Make

787
00:58:32,555 --> 00:58:34,719
another strength saving throw to hold onto the
book.

788
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,830
SAM: Oh, that's 17.

789
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:42,534
MATT: 17, okay. The book you hold onto with one
hand, and you pull it back--

790
00:58:42,534 --> 00:58:48,975
SAM: I'll try to cast a more powerful spell into
it without hurting it, though, that's the thing.

791
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:57,459
If I do Lightning, what if it burns the fucking
book? I'll do Thunderwave on it, right?

792
00:58:57,459 --> 00:58:59,093
MATT: Thunderwave, the 1st-level spell?

793
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:03,805
LAURA: Don't you have Suggestion?

794
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:10,481
SAM: Yeah. I'll Dominate Monster, that's a super
high-level spell.

795
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:11,627
MATT: What level spell is that?

796
00:59:11,627 --> 00:59:12,690
SAM: Eight.

797
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,819
MATT: 8th-level spell, Dominate Monster on the
book? Okay! As you're flying through, you cast the

798
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:22,567
spell into the book and the book takes the
entirety of the spell into it, and you watch as

799
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:29,246
suddenly text emboldens across all the pages on
the inside. The book is now filled with

800
00:59:29,246 --> 00:59:31,768
scribblings and writing.

801
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,038
LAURA: What language is it?!

802
00:59:33,038 --> 00:59:34,659
SAM: I don't know, what language is it?!

803
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:37,042
MATT: It appears to be Common to you.

804
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:38,981
(yelling)

805
00:59:38,981 --> 00:59:42,480
SAM: It's a notebook! It's somebody who was
figuring this out as they were writing it!

806
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,956
MATT: You glance over your shoulder, and it's
empty.

807
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,806
LAURA: Are you sure something's there?

808
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:49,783
SAM: Yes, I have a beautiful mind!

809
00:59:49,783 --> 00:59:52,389
(laughter)

810
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:58,356
MATT: With that, you arc down into the center of
the library where you see the large dome where you

811
00:59:58,356 --> 01:00:02,338
first met Ioun. You're not sure how much time you
have left, but it's down to the wire.

812
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:07,438
SAM: Do I see any words that say isolation or
incantation or anything?

813
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,513
LAURA: It's a small book.

814
01:00:09,513 --> 01:00:12,786
SAM: I like to read things and really understand.

815
01:00:12,786 --> 01:00:21,352
MATT: The script on the cover seems, in a weird
way, the best I could say is a Google Translate

816
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:25,057
version, but it loosely translates to the Tome of
Isolation, yes.

817
01:00:25,057 --> 01:00:26,859
LAURA: It's the whole thing!

818
01:00:26,859 --> 01:00:27,973
SAM: It's a cookbook.

819
01:00:27,973 --> 01:00:29,443
TRAVIS: She just asked for the tome, right? You
got it.

820
01:00:29,443 --> 01:00:30,448
LAURA and SAM: Yeah!

821
01:00:30,448 --> 01:00:32,253
MARISHA: Alone: I am Tome.

822
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:35,020
TRAVIS: She disappeared. Where is she?

823
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,411
LAURA: She's going to reappear, obviously. She
knows we're here.

824
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:39,085
SAM: Let's go down to her bowl.

825
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:40,196
LAURA: Yeah, we're at the bowl.

826
01:00:40,196 --> 01:00:42,606
SAM: All right, so let's go down into the bowl and
wait for her to arrive.

827
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:45,925
MATT: You guys land in the center there. What's
everybody else doing right now?

828
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,044
LIAM: I barrel rolled out of the way as they
rushed by.

829
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,501
TALIESIN: I was sitting on the couch.

830
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:51,129
TRAVIS: I've been digging through the pillows.

831
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:53,630
LAURA: Looking for change in the couch?

832
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:59,098
DARIN: Did you know that "Heck, nah" could rhyme
with Vecna? Did you hear what I said?

833
01:00:59,098 --> 01:01:05,153
SAM: I heard when you yelled it. It was the "Neck,
Ma," that I couldn't come up with a way--

834
01:01:05,153 --> 01:01:09,836
DARIN: If you're speaking to your mother, let's
say, and pointing at your neck.

835
01:01:09,836 --> 01:01:11,387
LAURA: You're such a pain in the neck, Ma!

836
01:01:11,387 --> 01:01:17,581
DARIN: Exactly! Pain in the neck, Ma! Looking for
Vecna, he's a pain in the neck, Ma! Find him? I

837
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:19,116
say heck nah!

838
01:01:19,116 --> 01:01:22,394
SAM: I wish you would have been chosen by Ioun.

839
01:01:22,394 --> 01:01:31,331
MATT: As soon as that happens, the wind picks up,
and for a moment you close your eyes from the

840
01:01:31,331 --> 01:01:35,775
sudden burst of air into your face. As you reopen
and adjust, there in the center of the dome where

841
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:42,279
she was before, you see the Knowing Mistress.
There, resting her arms crossed in front of her

842
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:48,976
robes. She looks out. "Are you to present your
findings?"

843
01:01:48,976 --> 01:02:03,583
SAM: I casually blow the hair out of my face and
walk over to her and say, O mighty goddess, it was

844
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:11,862
a challenging challenge, but I think you'll be
pretty happy with the results. As I hold up the

845
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:17,539
book, I'll cast Wrist Pocket and make it
disappear. Oh god, oh it's gone! Just kidding. And

846
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:19,136
it's back.

847
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:20,933
MATT: She doesn't flinch.

848
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:25,939
SAM: This is what we've found for you. I hope it
pleases you.

849
01:02:25,939 --> 01:02:28,305
MATT: "And this is your final choice?"

850
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:31,927
SAM: You know, we didn't actually look at the
other ten books.

851
01:02:31,927 --> 01:02:33,239
TRAVIS: Regis Philbin.

852
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:34,950
LIAM: Is that your final answer?

853
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:44,626
SAM: Yes. With conviction, I firmly believe that
this is the correct book.

854
01:02:44,626 --> 01:02:57,498
MATT: "Very well." She takes it and looks at it.
"It has been a while since I thumbed through these

855
01:02:57,498 --> 01:03:07,790
"pages myself. This will do you well in the coming
fray." And she hands it out to you.

856
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,161
SAM: Can I still see the writing?

857
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,384
MATT: Yeah.

858
01:03:11,384 --> 01:03:15,816
SAM: I'll cherish it always.

859
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:29,767
MATT: "You, who have wandered the vast library
that surrounds you through your knowledge, through

860
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:39,370
"your magnetic telling and spinning of yarns,
through your knowledge of history, perseverance,

861
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:48,652
"and apparently decent grip, have managed to return
to me and complete the challenge I set before you.

862
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:59,547
"And for that, I grant my grace unto you for the
coming fray, Scanlan Shorthalt." And it's a little

863
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:05,258
off-putting at first, but in her forehead, where
you saw her two purple eyes, a third eye opens up

864
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:12,341
in the center of the forehead. It seems to glow
for a second. You watch as on Scanlan, this warmth

865
01:04:12,341 --> 01:04:16,771
fills your body; you stand up straight
instinctually. You guys watch as this strange

866
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:21,129
purple glow appears in the center of his forehead
in the same place where her eye was.

867
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:22,976
LAURA: Ugh, you have a third eye!

868
01:04:22,976 --> 01:04:24,424
SAM: Is it cool or is it gross?

869
01:04:24,424 --> 01:04:25,972
TRAVIS and LIAM: It's cool.

870
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:27,827
SAM: Chicks will dig?

871
01:04:27,827 --> 01:04:30,303
TRAVIS: Yep! Third nip, third eye. You're good.

872
01:04:30,303 --> 01:04:38,408
MATT: It gently fades away. The warmth vanishes
and you're restored to yourself. That given the

873
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:46,792
case, you have the Tome of Isolation and the
Blessing of the Knowing Mistress.

874
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:50,168
LIAM: You chose wisely.

875
01:04:50,168 --> 01:04:59,346
SAM: Okay, I gain plus two to my intelligence!
Whoa!

876
01:04:59,346 --> 01:05:01,673
MARISHA: All the timesies?!

877
01:05:01,673 --> 01:05:05,846
SAM: As a bonus action, I can channel the
omniscience of Ioun. For one hour, whenever you

878
01:05:05,846 --> 01:05:09,508
successfully hit a creature with a spell or
attack, you can learn one of the creature's stats

879
01:05:09,508 --> 01:05:16,299
of your choice from the following list: AC,
senses, saving throw bonuses, damage resistances,

880
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:21,679
damage immunities, damage vulnerabilities. During
this hour, you also have advantage on initiative

881
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:29,142
rolls and on saving throws. Once this ability is
used, it cannot be used again for a week. Okay!

882
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:31,423
MARISHA: How many things can you learn about?

883
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:32,619
SAM: Just one.

884
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:35,281
LAURA: We can learn what its vulnerabilities are.

885
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:37,073
LIAM: That's like a game mod for a character.

886
01:05:37,073 --> 01:05:43,859
TRAVIS: It's the gold thing that came with the
original Nintendo Entertainment System. The Game

887
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,317
Genie.

888
01:05:45,317 --> 01:05:49,613
LIAM: I certainly remembered my Charlemagne! Let
my armies be the--

889
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:54,462
LIAM and TALIESIN: -- rocks and the trees and birds
in the sky.

890
01:05:54,462 --> 01:06:04,135
SAM: The tome: As an action, I can expend a spell
slot of any level higher than three, thank you

891
01:06:04,135 --> 01:06:11,881
Travis. The cover and the pages glow of secret
text of the Rites of Prime Banishment. While

892
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:16,902
legible, you can spend an action to invoke the
Rites of Banishment against the target. The target

893
01:06:16,902 --> 01:06:22,608
must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the
target is banished and sealed and this book is

894
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:30,250
immediately teleported to the Endless Atheneeum.
On a success, the text becomes blurred until the

895
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,063
end of your next turn.

896
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,356
LAURA: On a success?

897
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,158
SAM: On a success. On a failure of their saving
throw. Right, yeah?

898
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,530
MATT: If they succeed on their saving throw, they
resist the ability and you cannot read the book

899
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,797
for another turn.

900
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:44,038
SAM: Got it. Then, after that turn, I can read it
again?

901
01:06:44,038 --> 01:06:45,787
LAURA: What does it say the DC is?

902
01:06:45,787 --> 01:06:57,548
SAM: DC ten. A wisdom saving throw-- oh! That's key
info. Plus five to DC for each Divine Trammel

903
01:06:57,548 --> 01:07:06,217
fused to the target. We've got to be matadors and
attach a bunch of pegs to the thing before we

904
01:07:06,217 --> 01:07:07,714
deliver the killing blow.

905
01:07:07,714 --> 01:07:10,234
LAURA: We literally stick the trammels onto
Vecna?

906
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:14,434
SAM: We'll be picadors, right? They put the darts
on the back of the bull to soften it up and

907
01:07:14,434 --> 01:07:16,785
(whoosh) killing blow!

908
01:07:16,785 --> 01:07:19,423
MARISHA: And do we have any of these yet?

909
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:22,450
LAURA: I have one! No, I have a stone.

910
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:26,470
MATT: You have a stone that supposedly has
something to do with their construction.

911
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,461
MARISHA: But we were supposed to ask Ioun.

912
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,672
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to.

913
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:31,294
SAM: No, I think we're done here, guys.

914
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:32,969
LIAM: We'll just go to Home Depot and get some
trammels.

915
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:35,863
LAURA: Can I pull out the little pearl of power?

916
01:07:35,863 --> 01:07:44,663
MATT: All right. You pull it out and there it
glows before you. It's bright like a tiny star for

917
01:07:44,663 --> 01:07:48,980
a second and you have to avert your gaze. But
there it is, still warm to the touch. The small

918
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:59,897
pearl of bright, divine light. "With this
blessing, I hope to be of some aid in the coming

919
01:07:59,897 --> 01:08:08,558
"battle. Also, any questions you may have, I'm here
to answer."

920
01:08:08,558 --> 01:08:10,172
SAM: Yes, so many!

921
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:16,672
LAURA: How do we make a trammel? We have a stone,
and we want more, I assume.

922
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:25,881
MATT: "The Prime Trammel you speak of, the
companion to this rite of which you've sought out

923
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:34,597
"and recovered, the construct is small, but
complex. The design is unknowable for most mortal

924
01:08:34,597 --> 01:08:43,607
"eyes. Each trammel requires a fragment of
divinity. You have one there. That fragment is

925
01:08:43,607 --> 01:08:55,799
"lost until the seal is broken, so it is a very
exhausting process for a deity to give this

926
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,731
"fragment.

927
01:08:57,731 --> 01:09:03,351
"Now, the original trammels that we had utilized
were forged by the hand of the Allhammer atop the

928
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:06,647
"fiery Core Anvil deep beneath the Ozmit Sea."

929
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:09,043
MARISHA: Wait, the core?

930
01:09:09,043 --> 01:09:10,422
MATT: "The Core Anvil."

931
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:12,214
LAURA: In the Ozmit Sea.

932
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:23,089
MATT: "To seal a god, the number of trammels you
will require depends on how marred the god may be.

933
01:09:23,089 --> 01:09:35,005
"You have an easier chance of applying the trammels
the more wounded the entity is. It is imperfect,

934
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:41,630
"and it's only been given use the once against the
Chained Oblivion. With the Luck Bringer's

935
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:48,450
"blessing, we succeeded against the entity. It took
us four trammels and the full might of Pelor upon

936
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:54,825
"the beast to banish it beyond the veil. However,
the Chained Oblivion's power was fully realized at

937
01:09:54,825 --> 01:09:55,958
"this time.

938
01:09:55,958 --> 01:10:13,146
"Now, the Core Anvil, this was part of the domain
of the Allhammer's greatest creations. It was

939
01:10:13,146 --> 01:10:20,582
"where the first dwarves were given form and
breath, it's where the trammels were carved and

940
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:28,515
"made in the last great war. It lies beneath the
undersea volcano now known as Scaldseat."

941
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,622
LAURA: Scaldseat?

942
01:10:30,622 --> 01:10:38,540
MATT: "Scaldseat. It sits at the bottom of the
ocean off the eastern coast of Issylra, not far

943
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:42,112
"from the fishing village known as Shorecomb."

944
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:50,509
At which point, the third eye flashes in the
direction of Keyleth. Keyleth, a vision fills your

945
01:10:50,509 --> 01:10:59,583
mind suddenly of the shoreline over Issylra. The
cold, cloud-covered sky, but you see below grass

946
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:10,197
and recent rainfall-covered fields that lead to a
somewhat marshy and mud-covered shoreline. There,

947
01:11:10,197 --> 01:11:17,643
you see a small fishing village leading out to a
rocky beachfront and waves that crest and break

948
01:11:17,643 --> 01:11:24,348
against a drop-off into the ocean. You can see
some low-built docks that lead all the fishermen

949
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:33,105
in and out into the ocean. The vision pulls you
back miles away from that. You get a sense, as you

950
01:11:33,105 --> 01:11:45,090
see this small column of black smoke that emerges
from the ocean across endless open sea, that is

951
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:51,848
the signal of where this volcano lies.

952
01:11:51,848 --> 01:12:04,046
The vision fades from you. She leans to you and
says, "Find a way below, through the tunnels of

953
01:12:04,046 --> 01:12:13,678
"toxic fume, unbreathable without proper
preparation, to the Core Anvil and forge these

954
01:12:13,678 --> 01:12:21,989
"trammels. Be warned: There may be protections that
still remain within the forgotten halls of the

955
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:30,641
"Allhammer, or new denizens that occupy the
subterranean depths. Now, to forge such a trammel,

956
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:39,041
"however, is an undertaking no mortal has
attempted. To shape the materials would require

957
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:41,034
"the strength of a titan."

958
01:12:41,034 --> 01:12:55,994
She looks towards you and the eye flashes and
suddenly your mind fills with hundreds of years of

959
01:12:55,994 --> 01:13:02,674
the knowledge of folding heated metals, of the
clinks of lives past, shaping and building weapons

960
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:08,757
and armor and for a second you pull back and you
can see the large dwarf-like stone form of the

961
01:13:08,757 --> 01:13:22,386
Allhammer, slamming down onto the heated metals of
the Core Anvil. As the vision fades, you know how

962
01:13:22,386 --> 01:13:26,799
to forge, so you are now proficient with
blacksmithing tools.

963
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:29,266
TRAVIS: Proficient with blacksmithing tools?

964
01:13:29,266 --> 01:13:33,517
LAURA: Awesome! Oh my god, you were a boot maker,
and now you're a weapon maker!

965
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:38,924
MATT: Suddenly, you understand most of the tools
in Percy's workshop.

966
01:13:38,924 --> 01:13:41,878
TRAVIS: That water's not so evil, after all!

967
01:13:41,878 --> 01:13:45,424
(laughter)

968
01:13:45,424 --> 01:13:48,022
TRAVIS: Wait a minute!

969
01:13:48,022 --> 01:13:58,834
MATT: "But not just the strength of a titan. For
to understand the intricacies of this design will

970
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:05,227
"also require the ingenuity of a madman." She turns
towards you, Percy.

971
01:14:05,227 --> 01:14:08,202
TRAVIS: Don't look at somebody else, motherfucker.
That's you!

972
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:11,004
MARISHA: Trying to look away, kid at the back of the
classroom.

973
01:14:11,004 --> 01:14:13,729
LIAM: Percy takes one step behind Keyleth.

974
01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:17,259
TRAVIS: It's like the kid that farts in class and then
looks at the guy behind him.

975
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:23,898
MATT: The third eye opens once more and flashes.
You see the purple glow in the center of

976
01:14:23,898 --> 01:14:29,797
Percival's forehead for a moment. In an instant,
the intricate designs of the Prime Trammel flood

977
01:14:29,797 --> 01:14:35,747
into your mind, the celestial instructions racing
through like a shock of electricity, the

978
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:39,177
blueprints spinning like a clear dream, straight
out of Flight of the Navigator, all of the star

979
01:14:39,177 --> 01:14:44,065
charts being crammed at once. With that, it drops
from your mind and you fall to your knees with a

980
01:14:44,065 --> 01:14:45,903
pounding headache.

981
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:52,556
TALIESIN: I'm not supposed to know that. (groans)

982
01:14:52,556 --> 01:15:14,427
MATT: "And you will only know it for as long as
it's required." She thinks for a second. "We, the

983
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:22,834
"creators, did breathe the beauty into this world,
we planted the seeds that would blossom into this

984
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:33,257
"incredible weave of Exandria. However, what is the
purpose of the parent but to teach what they can,

985
01:15:33,257 --> 01:15:42,163
"then set the children free? Some gods rule through
fear, others through love, and others still

986
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:54,301
"through perceived fate. Destiny has its place, but
the real deception is that you have no choice. A

987
01:15:54,301 --> 01:16:06,094
"path can be groomed before you, but it is you who
must take those steps. Not every rosy walkway

988
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:09,047
"leads to a better day.

989
01:16:09,047 --> 01:16:17,153
"For me, our greatest purpose has passed the
moment we granted your forbearers the spark to

990
01:16:17,153 --> 01:16:30,640
"seek their own purpose. We now stay to inspire, to
guide, to guard the Gate, to keep the hate of

991
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:40,979
"ignorance we spawned in our hubris from burning
away everything. The rest is up to you. We need

992
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:54,642
"you, perhaps, but you do not need us. That is our
gift. You, Fate-Touched, you are the embodiment of

993
01:16:54,642 --> 01:17:07,088
"this truth. All mortal life has potential with or
without the gods. We offer some paths, but it's up

994
01:17:07,088 --> 01:17:18,997
"to you to decide if they are the right ones for
you. Anyway." And she clutches her stomach a

995
01:17:18,997 --> 01:17:24,352
moment. "What more do you ask of me? What more do
you wish to know?"

996
01:17:24,503 --> 01:17:26,143
LIAM: I have questions.

997
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,020
MATT: "Yes, ask."

998
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:39,254
LIAM: Vecna. You're familiar. You know not where
he is. You know of him.

999
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:46,775
MATT: "I know as much of his history as I was
allowed to see, yes. Vecna was a force of

1000
01:17:46,775 --> 01:17:54,780
"insurmountable intellect among mortals, and his
creative bending of known arcane theory enabled

1001
01:17:54,780 --> 01:18:02,736
"many of the powerful artifacts of war that stoked
the flames of the Calamity a century later. His

1002
01:18:02,736 --> 01:18:10,314
"contributions were appreciated, but overlooked by
those around him. In his hubris, he sought to

1003
01:18:10,314 --> 01:18:19,396
"carve history in his image. He sought forgotten
magics and slew those who shared this same

1004
01:18:19,396 --> 01:18:26,311
"knowledge to leave only him standing with it. He
bypassed his own mortality through terrible

1005
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:33,506
"necromantic rites to lichdom, amassing a force of
like-minded followers and hordes of undead

1006
01:18:33,506 --> 01:18:42,165
"terrors, then vanished into the Shadowfell to
overtake the dark city of Thar Amphala, where he

1007
01:18:42,165 --> 01:18:51,396
"erected the terrible tower Entropis. From this
very seat of power, Vecna harnessed an event

1008
01:18:51,396 --> 01:19:02,475
"called the Celestial Solstice. He used this
merging of ley energies and power to reforge

1009
01:19:02,475 --> 01:19:10,100
"manses of energy all across Exandria to suit his
needs, opening the portals at his whim within his

1010
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:20,784
"city to anywhere across the world, allowing his
armies to lay siege to anything before him and

1011
01:19:20,784 --> 01:19:28,145
"extend his influence and rule. His horde assaulted
a couple of prominent townships, slaughtering

1012
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:33,788
"denizens and forcing old enemies to kneel, before
slaying and raising them as his own.

1013
01:19:33,788 --> 01:19:45,898
"One such rival was named Kas, who, upon their
defeat, was offered eternal life through vampirism

1014
01:19:45,995 --> 01:19:57,251
"in exchange for swearing fealty to Vecna as his
chief lieutenant. This made Kas into Kas the

1015
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:05,897
"Bloody-Handed. Vecna forged a relic blade for him
with a fraction of his consciousness and gifted it

1016
01:20:05,897 --> 01:20:11,407
"to his new lieutenant, and with this, the lich
lord had become a new terror among the rising

1017
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:17,560
"tensions of the bickering nations. Months of
turmoil followed as the shadow of Vecna's

1018
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:28,500
"unstoppable forces struck with precision and those
fled before retaliation. However, the use of the

1019
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:37,319
"Solstice was discovered and reverse-engineered,
allowing the holy army the Beacon of Arms to storm

1020
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:43,107
"his city under the banner of the Dawnfather, led
by the champion Yos Varder.

1021
01:20:43,107 --> 01:20:51,000
"Climbing Entropis to face the lich lord in
combat, Yos Varder was struck down by the Undying

1022
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:59,445
"King with a mortal blow. In the final moments of
the hero's life, he witnessed the lieutenant Kas

1023
01:20:59,445 --> 01:21:08,207
"turn on his winded master and strike him with the
very blade he was gifted, driven to usurp him, to

1024
01:21:08,207 --> 01:21:17,259
"become his own, new lord. The ensuing conflict
left Kas nothing but ash, and utterly destroyed

1025
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:29,092
"Vecna's body, leaving nothing but his left eye and
hand. Yos passed on to the realm of Pelor, due to

1026
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:33,099
"his wounds, and the survivors left the Shadowfell
with tales of victory.

1027
01:21:33,099 --> 01:21:45,099
"The terrible artifacts: the eye, the hand, the
sword, were never recovered. The sword is bent on

1028
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:52,609
"vengeance, on hatred for the Whispered One. A
powerful evil drives that sword, but for a just

1029

"end. Should one be able to find and tame such a
thing, it may be of great use.

1030
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:08,846
"That is all I have to offer on the history of
Vecna and I hope it can be of aid to you in your

1031
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:10,519
"coming battle."

1032
01:22:10,519 --> 01:22:14,752
TALIESIN: What was the name of the sword?

1033
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:16,887
MATT: "The Sword of Kas."

1034
01:22:16,887 --> 01:22:18,831
MARISHA: The Sword of Kas. Okay.

1035
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:20,681
LAURA: Did it have a name?

1036
01:22:20,681 --> 01:22:22,909
TALIESIN: Where was it last seen?

1037
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:25,917
MATT: In Thar Amphala, at the scene of the
battle.

1038
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:32,867
MARISHA: Oh! Okay. The Sword of Kas.

1039
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:34,335
LAURA: You don't think?

1040
01:22:34,335 --> 01:22:36,880
SAM: I don't think. What are the odds, right?

1041
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,445
TRAVIS: It was 800 years ago.

1042
01:22:38,445 --> 01:22:41,480
MARISHA and SAM: Different sword.

1043
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,234
TRAVIS: Not Craven Edge?

1044
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:45,438
LIAM: I have another question for you.

1045
01:22:45,438 --> 01:22:46,654
MATT: "Yes?"

1046
01:22:46,654 --> 01:22:49,489
LIAM: You know who I serve.

1047
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:54,277
MATT: "I do. I see the shadows that cling to
you."

1048
01:22:54,277 --> 01:23:13,536
LIAM: Vecna seeks godhood, and we understand that
my lady achieved the same. Did you learn anything

1049
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:20,320
from her path that would help us here?

1050
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:35,389
MATT: (sighs) You watch as suddenly her expression
changes. Her mouth falls open ever so gently and

1051
01:23:35,389 --> 01:23:45,665
her hair, wavy and calm, seems to curl in but a
moment and lift. Her expression falls to one of

1052
01:23:45,665 --> 01:24:05,501
trepidation and horror. "And then there was one
more.

1053
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:20,112
"The ritual is complete. I can sense his
ascension. The cosmos expand to make room.

1054
01:24:20,112 --> 01:24:36,154
"Our timetable accelerates." You can see now, her
eyes begin to race back and forth. "It will take

1055
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:42,122
"him some time to understand and utilize his nature
fully. If he expands beyond his avatar, it will be

1056
01:24:42,122 --> 01:24:46,829
"more difficult to seal him. The more trammels it
may require and the loss maybe far greater."

1057
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:51,073
LAURA: Do you have a seed of power?

1058
01:24:51,073 --> 01:25:04,587
MATT: "Understand," and she leans forward to you.
"I am not Ioun given full form, but a partial

1059
01:25:04,587 --> 01:25:11,719
"avatar of my essence given shape by the worship of
my children, as was the Dawnfather that guided you

1060
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:18,851
"here. Our realms are our bodies, and our true
presence held in the hearts of those that grant us

1061
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:28,972
"their faith. To hold purely as an avatar like this
is dangerous, for while it focuses and grants us

1062
01:25:28,972 --> 01:25:35,714
"much present power, as we were forced to do in the
Calamity, in the last great war, it may also leave

1063
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,413
"us open to grievous injury."

1064
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:46,053
She opens her robe, and there you can see amongst
the olive-gold skin, you see a large darkened gash

1065
01:25:46,053 --> 01:25:53,345
that still festers, unhealed to this day, of
black, curling void. As you look at this open

1066
01:25:53,345 --> 01:25:59,636
wound, you feel yourself drawn toward it; your
vision begins to be pulled towards this infinite

1067
01:25:59,636 --> 01:26:04,419
nothing. She closes it. You can see a bit of sweat
dripping from the brow.

1068
01:26:04,419 --> 01:26:14,298
"The cost was great, but necessary. Vecna's
ascended being is fresh. He will need to expand

1069
01:26:14,298 --> 01:26:22,606
"his worship vastly to learn how to disseminate his
power and claim his domains. What he will need for

1070
01:26:22,606 --> 01:26:31,363
"this to happen is a display of unstoppable power,
a miracle of terror, a wave of despair that would

1071
01:26:31,363 --> 01:26:38,545
"occupy the hearts of many in but a moment. I know
not his method, but I know enough of his ways to

1072
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:45,423
"assume there's already a plan in motion and has
been for some time. If you can strike before he

1073
01:26:45,423 --> 01:26:51,821
"claims his full ascension, before he can seize his
dominion on this plane, than you may still have a

1074
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:53,812
"chance."

1075
01:26:53,812 --> 01:27:04,645
She turns to you, Scanlan. "You are the teller of
tales, one who enlivens the world through song and word.

1076
01:27:04,645 --> 01:27:13,002
"Take this fragment of my own story and help craft
the passages of the world's future." She reaches

1077
01:27:13,002 --> 01:27:19,100
into the center of her robe, and almost seems to
be into her chest and plucks forth a small, gray

1078
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:26,530
gem about the size of a peanut. It glows faintly,
and as she removes it, you hear a terrible

1079
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:32,946
creaking sound throughout the library. You watch
as books plummet from the darkness above and slam

1080
01:27:32,946 --> 01:27:39,366
into the ground around you. Distant cases crack
and bow. The roar of the damaged space echoes to a

1081
01:27:39,366 --> 01:27:52,096
halt, the danger seemingly in control. "There. I
can spare no more. I must rest and concentrate."

1082
01:27:52,096 --> 01:27:58,835
DARIN: I have something of you inside of me. Would
it help you?

1083
01:27:58,835 --> 01:28:12,615
MATT: She smiles. "I could use a steward for a
moment. Someone eager to learn and relearn some

1084
01:28:12,615 --> 01:28:18,456
"important lessons. Ethred Brokenbranch."

1085
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:20,407
DARIN: That's me!

1086
01:28:20,407 --> 01:28:25,392
MATT: "Would you be so kind as to help an old
woman tend to her books a bit?"

1087
01:28:25,436 --> 01:28:35,410
DARIN: It would be my pleasure. I didn't believe
in you. I didn't think you were real, but I found

1088
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:50,224
out that things aren't what we seem. And things
can change. It would be my honor. (stammers) Could

1089
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:51,756
I say goodbye?

1090
01:28:51,756 --> 01:28:53,821
MATT: "Of course."

1091
01:28:53,821 --> 01:29:02,107
DARIN: Also, do you know where there's an imp by
the name of Demistrik and if he's all right?

1092
01:29:02,107 --> 01:29:06,070
MATT: "He's fine for now."

1093
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:11,458
DARIN: I'm not asking for me. The nice lady with
the antlers wanted to know.

1094
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:19,877
MATT: "He's fine, but woe to those who live in the
home in Kraghammer where he's currently rooted."

1095
01:29:19,877 --> 01:29:25,416
DARIN: He's a very bad performer. I'll be right
with you.

1096
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:26,884
MATT: "Of course."

1097
01:29:26,884 --> 01:29:35,673
DARIN: Well, then. This is different! I don't
think I'm going to be alone anymore. I asked you

1098
01:29:35,673 --> 01:29:40,474
for power, but it seems like you gave me
strength.

1099
01:29:40,474 --> 01:29:45,975
TRAVIS: Oh. I'm glad to hear that.

1100
01:29:45,975 --> 01:29:55,936
DARIN: Thank you. And you. You called me darling.
No one ever did that before. (growl)

1101
01:29:55,936 --> 01:29:58,311
LAURA: (tongue click) I kiss him on the forehead.

1102
01:29:58,311 --> 01:30:13,354
DARIN: Well! Oh dear me. Oh goodness gracious. Be
happy. Life is loud and noisy, and it's a

1103
01:30:13,354 --> 01:30:26,805
celebration. I didn't know that. So once in a
while, with what little time we have, be happy. I

1104
01:30:26,805 --> 01:30:28,833
was wrong about you, you know.

1105
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:30,066
SAM: Me?

1106
01:30:30,066 --> 01:30:37,129
DARIN: Oh, you're far greater than I will ever be.
If only I could be a mirror of you.

1107
01:30:37,321 --> 01:30:44,814
SAM: Thank you, Sprigg, for everything. We've only
known you a short time--

1108
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:51,985
DARIN: I'm only a short person. (laughs) You can
have that one for free. Okay, good. Go on.

1109
01:30:51,985 --> 01:30:59,003
SAM: No, you've taught us much in a short time,
and I'm sorry that we broke your house, but it

1110
01:30:59,003 --> 01:31:03,563
seems like you've found a suitable replacement.

1111
01:31:03,563 --> 01:31:12,422
DARIN: Well, a lot of books in here. That's going
to keep me busy. And you (groans) secrets.

1112
01:31:12,422 --> 01:31:20,889
Celebrate it with your friends. Remember that. And
when I look at these books, I'm going to think of

1113
01:31:20,889 --> 01:31:22,125
you.

1114
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,938
TALIESIN: That pleases me.

1115
01:31:23,938 --> 01:31:25,487
DARIN: Oh, good.

1116
01:31:25,487 --> 01:31:27,480
TALIESIN: Be happy here.

1117
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:39,994
DARIN: (laughs) I think you're going to be the
hardest to say goodbye to, because you cared. No

1118
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:45,491
one ever cared before. That's why they called me
Sprigg. I wasn't good enough to be a Brokenbranch.

1119
01:31:45,491 --> 01:31:49,385
I was just a sprig. That's how I got my name.

1120
01:31:49,385 --> 01:31:56,705
MARISHA: If only people knew that sprigs give
foundation to the entire tree.

1121
01:31:56,705 --> 01:32:10,891
DARIN: Thank you.

1122
01:32:10,891 --> 01:32:13,748
MATT: She extends her hand to you.

1123
01:32:13,748 --> 01:32:17,972
DARIN: Well, this is new.

1124
01:32:17,972 --> 01:32:25,710
MATT: "And should your friends succeed, there is
far much more to look forward to learning."

1125
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:33,971
DARIN: Excellent. But some of those little wispy
things, I don't trust them, you know. If they get

1126
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:39,550
out of order, we should wispy thing grab. How will
we remember that?

1127
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,873
MATT: "This is going to be a very good
conversation to have."

1128
01:32:42,873 --> 01:32:46,777
DARIN: We need a mnemonic device. Come! We'll
think of one.

1129
01:32:46,777 --> 01:32:56,107
MATT: "Very well. We shall. As for the rest of
you, I feel my power is waned, and I don't have

1130
01:32:56,107 --> 01:33:05,459
"the means of sending you away myself. But if you
are able to return under your own power?"

1131
01:33:05,459 --> 01:33:09,491
MARISHA: (whispers) Of course.

1132
01:33:09,491 --> 01:33:20,905
MATT: "Then I wish you all the greatest of luck.
And please, don't be a stranger."

1133
01:33:20,905 --> 01:33:25,157
LAURA: Oh! I have your books.

1134
01:33:25,157 --> 01:33:28,843
SAM: Oh, yes. 24 of them.

1135
01:33:28,843 --> 01:33:34,706
LAURA: I think they were really secret ones, so I
would hate to take those out of here.

1136
01:33:34,706 --> 01:33:38,902
MATT: You watch as three spectral servants
apparate behind you and pick up the books and

1137
01:33:38,902 --> 01:33:48,369
begin to take them back to be organized. "Not to
worry. Travel safe, my friends. And Scanlan, don't

1138
01:33:48,369 --> 01:33:58,509
"ever forget how important you are to them, to
Kaylie, and to yourself. You owe yourself far more

1139
01:33:58,509 --> 01:34:00,628
"that you lend."

1140
01:34:00,628 --> 01:34:02,552
SAM: I will remember.

1141
01:34:02,552 --> 01:34:09,531
DARIN: Goodbye.

1142
01:34:09,531 --> 01:34:11,380
TRAVIS: Bye, Sprigg.

1143
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,669
LAURA: Take care, darling.

1144
01:34:12,669 --> 01:34:15,618
MARISHA: Bye, Sprigg.

1145
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:17,327
SAM: Until next time.

1146
01:34:17,327 --> 01:34:20,581
DARIN: That's good. Off we go, then.

1147
01:34:20,581 --> 01:34:26,198
MATT: "Come, my friend." She takes his hand and
stands up, and they both begin to walk away and as

1148
01:34:26,198 --> 01:34:33,112
it does there's a slight increase of light in the
room. There's a flash, and then as it slowly comes

1149
01:34:33,112 --> 01:34:44,366
back to a normal sight, you find yourself back at
the entrance almost bathhouse-like area of the domain

1150
01:34:44,366 --> 01:34:50,263
where you arrived, the marble slightly more
cracked that you left it before, but still

1151
01:34:50,263 --> 01:34:51,521
standing.

1152
01:34:51,521 --> 01:34:53,681
LIAM: Enjoy the other side, Sprigg.

1153
01:34:53,681 --> 01:34:57,713
LAURA: I go up to Percy. Are you all right, dear?

1154
01:34:57,713 --> 01:35:08,289
TALIESIN: Strangely, yes. Yes, quite. Didn't think
I would be.

1155
01:35:08,289 --> 01:35:16,182
MARISHA: Vax. Is that what's going to happen when
you leave?

1156
01:35:16,182 --> 01:35:21,415
LIAM: (whispers) I don't know.

1157
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:30,542
MARISHA: Okay. Shall we?

1158
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:31,983
LAURA: Where are we going?

1159
01:35:31,983 --> 01:35:35,297
TALIESIN: Back to where we came from.

1160
01:35:35,297 --> 01:35:37,530
TRAVIS: In the beginning? Or more recently?

1161
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:38,952
TALIESIN: Back to the cabin.

1162
01:35:38,952 --> 01:35:40,176
SAM: The cabin?

1163
01:35:40,176 --> 01:35:42,039
TALIESIN: The little house.

1164
01:35:42,039 --> 01:35:46,728
SAM: You mean Sprigg's cabin? Why would we go
there?

1165
01:35:46,728 --> 01:35:51,195
TALIESIN: Because we still have a man tied up.
He's been sitting there for probably about an hour

1166
01:35:51,195 --> 01:35:52,176
or two.

1167
01:35:52,176 --> 01:35:53,214
SAM: Who?

1168
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:55,813
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, the guy that you put in the
shackles.

1169
01:35:55,813 --> 01:35:58,465
SAM: I'm sure he's fine. Let's just go to
Whitestone.

1170
01:35:58,465 --> 01:36:01,001
TRAVIS: But we want to get the shackles back.

1171
01:36:01,001 --> 01:36:02,470
SAM: Oh, it's the shackles.

1172
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:05,011
TALIESIN: Well, I want to talk to him, too, but
yes.

1173
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:06,500
SAM: We're going for the shackles.

1174
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,756
LAURA: They're pretty cool.

1175
01:36:07,756 --> 01:36:08,899
TALIESIN: They are pretty impressive.

1176
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:13,589
SAM: But she said the timetable is shortened.

1177
01:36:13,589 --> 01:36:16,634
TALIESIN: Why are we going to Whitestone, then?

1178
01:36:16,634 --> 01:36:20,792
SAM: We have to find this place in the middle of
the ocean.

1179
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:24,747
TALIESIN: Well, now that we know where it is, you
can probably bamf us there, can't you?

1180
01:36:24,747 --> 01:36:27,284
LIAM: I need to go Whitestone or to Vasselheim.

1181
01:36:27,284 --> 01:36:36,695
MARISHA: Before we go to Issylra? Wait. Is
Vasselheim on Issylra? How close did I recognize

1182
01:36:36,695 --> 01:36:38,183
the shore--

1183
01:36:38,183 --> 01:36:50,725
MATT: Shorecomb? Shorecomb is about 200, 250 miles
away from Vasselheim, to the southwest.

1184
01:36:50,725 --> 01:36:54,932
MARISHA: Southwest, going towards Pyrah. Okay.

1185
01:36:54,932 --> 01:36:57,621
MATT: Beyond Pyrah, along the coast.

1186
01:36:57,621 --> 01:37:06,432
MARISHA: Start there. I should be able to Tree
Stride us right there. Right?

1187
01:37:06,432 --> 01:37:08,515
LAURA: From the cabin to Vasselheim?

1188
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:10,899
MARISHA: I think so.

1189
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:18,723
MATT: None of the particular trees you got a close
look at. You may have to scry to get a specific

1190
01:37:18,723 --> 01:37:22,310
tree in mind for the spell, but you can do that.

1191
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:26,081
LAURA: Pike, you seem very quiet.

1192
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:31,194
MATT: Pike goes, "I'm sorry, I'm just overwhelmed.
There's a lot going on."

1193
01:37:31,194 --> 01:37:34,419
TRAVIS: I know when I feel overwhelmed I like to
punch things. You want to hit me?

1194
01:37:34,419 --> 01:37:37,647
MATT: "Okay." (punching noise) And she socks you
in the gut.

1195
01:37:37,647 --> 01:37:39,812
TRAVIS: (groans) Too strong. Oh, such a monster.

1196
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:42,309
MATT: "Sorry." And she Cures Wounds on you.

1197
01:37:42,309 --> 01:37:43,881
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1198
01:37:43,881 --> 01:37:46,881
MARISHA: I burn my 8th-level spell to Plane Shift
us back to Sprigg's house.

1199
01:37:46,881 --> 01:37:55,026
MATT: All right. As you all gather hands together,
with the familiar flash and a pull through the

1200
01:37:55,026 --> 01:38:01,547
Divine Gate, you all find yourselves thrust once
more back to the Prime Material Plane. As your

1201
01:38:01,547 --> 01:38:08,760
feet land squarely in the partially charred,
wooded remains of Sprigg's house, deep in a ravine

1202
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,800
in the Cliffkeep Mountains of Tal'Dorei in
Exandria. And that's where we're going to take a

1203
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:14,749
break.

1204
01:38:14,749 --> 01:38:15,936
SAM: Wow.

1205
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:18,006
TRAVIS: Fudge knuckles.

1206
01:38:18,006 --> 01:38:21,955
MATT: Darin. Thank you so much for joining us.

1207
01:38:21,955 --> 01:38:23,441
TRAVIS: Darin De Paul!

1208
01:38:23,441 --> 01:38:26,134
(applause)

1209
01:38:26,134 --> 01:38:31,181
MATT: Dude. Thank you for coming.

1210
01:38:31,181 --> 01:38:35,240
DARIN: It had to happen. It's history. It's a
journey.

1211
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:39,506
MARISHA: 35 years?

1212
01:38:39,506 --> 01:38:41,317
DARIN: 37.

1213
01:38:41,317 --> 01:38:44,403
MATT: It's crazy. I love it.

1214
01:38:44,403 --> 01:38:51,704
DARIN: And who knows? Maybe something will happen.
Yeah, in another 37 years! We'll do this again!

1215
01:38:51,704 --> 01:38:53,506
MATT: There you go. Hopefully sooner, but yeah.

1216
01:38:53,506 --> 01:38:54,951
DARIN: Thank you guys.

1217
01:38:54,951 --> 01:39:01,475
SAM: It was a pleasure. We know you just came on
this show so you could get onto Talks. But we'll

1218
01:39:01,475 --> 01:39:02,856
take it anyway.

1219
01:39:02,856 --> 01:39:05,039
MARISHA: Yeah, you could have just asked if you
wanted to meet Brian Foster.

1220
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,433
DARIN: His hair is so cool.

1221
01:39:07,433 --> 01:39:09,314
LAURA: He's got a good beard.

1222
01:39:09,314 --> 01:39:13,222
MATT: All right, guys, so before we go, we'll have
a giveaway during the break in which we're giving

1223
01:39:13,222 --> 01:39:20,287
out this awesome-- oh god, this awesome pieces of
pieces. This is the purpleheart dice tower from

1224
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:26,084
Wyrmwood. The same color that you use to assemble
your awesome magnetic dice tower from Wyrmwood.

1225
01:39:26,084 --> 01:39:28,756
What was the word we chose?

1226
01:39:28,756 --> 01:39:30,442
OFFSCREEN: Knowledge.

1227
01:39:30,442 --> 01:39:35,181
MATT: Thank you. Knowledge. The word in the chat
room is knowledge.

1228
01:39:35,181 --> 01:39:36,684
MARISHA: I thought you said college.

1229
01:39:36,684 --> 01:39:38,018
SAM: I did, too.

1230
01:39:38,018 --> 01:39:41,765
MATT: Yeah. Go to college, kids. But yeah, so go
over to the Twitch chat, and when prompted, go

1231
01:39:41,765 --> 01:39:44,562
ahead and enter the word knowledge to enter the
giveaway. And we'll have the announcement of who

1232
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:47,380
won that when we come back from the break. See you
guys in a few minutes.

1233
01:39:47,380 --> 01:59:49,561
[break]

1234
01:59:49,561 --> 01:59:55,373
MATT: And welcome back, everybody. Couple of
things. First off, couple of mid-show

1235
01:59:55,373 --> 01:59:59,472
announcements we forgot to mention. One, Laura did
Signal Boost, which you just saw!

1236
01:59:59,472 --> 02:00:01,118
(cheering)

1237
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:08,841
MATT: It's a good one. Second, if you haven't seen
it already, we announced at Comic-Con that we are

1238
02:00:08,841 --> 02:00:12,131
doing a Critical Role comic book.

1239
02:00:12,131 --> 02:00:14,815
(excited noises)

1240
02:00:14,815 --> 02:00:19,565
MATT: We're super excited. It's written by good
friend of the show Matt Colville. If you're not

1241
02:00:19,565 --> 02:00:22,583
familiar with his stuff, you should. He's written
a couple of books, he's written a lot of video

1242
02:00:22,583 --> 02:00:24,729
game stuff and he's very talented.

1243
02:00:24,729 --> 02:00:27,128
LIAM: The dialogue is to <i>die</i> for.

1244
02:00:27,128 --> 02:00:28,835
MARISHA: He is on this week's episode of GM Tips.

1245
02:00:28,835 --> 02:00:30,806
TALIESIN: You can check him out, right there.

1246
02:00:30,806 --> 02:00:35,702
MATT: He has a great YouTube channel. He's a good
friend of the show and his writing is amazing. And

1247
02:00:35,702 --> 02:00:41,622
our artist, Olivia Samson, who is a Critter artist
in the community for quite some time. We wanted to

1248
02:00:41,622 --> 02:00:48,811
pull somebody from the community to bring the story
to life of how Vox Machina came together, how they

1249
02:00:48,811 --> 02:00:54,996
met. And then, if it goes well, continue to do the
story of all the pre-stream adventures that you

1250
02:00:54,996 --> 02:00:59,824
guys didn't get a chance to see. That's the goal,
we'll see, long-term. We're happy to announce it.

1251
02:00:59,824 --> 02:01:02,499
We'll have more information in the future about it
as it comes out.

1252
02:01:02,499 --> 02:01:04,957
LIAM: I've seen most of the art for issue one and
it is fucking legit!

1253
02:01:04,957 --> 02:01:05,995
LAURA: I haven't seen it!

1254
02:01:05,995 --> 02:01:07,205
LIAM: Oh, well.

1255
02:01:07,205 --> 02:01:14,729
SAM: If I may, Matt? Music level, split the
difference.

1256
02:01:14,729 --> 02:01:24,395
TRAVIS: And to EmeraldStar in the chat, who named
their puppy Grog, that's awesome.

1257
02:01:24,395 --> 02:01:31,179
MATT: That is awesome. Congrats on your puppy!
There is a winner. Well, the puppy named Grog. And

1258
02:01:31,179 --> 02:01:37,226
the winner of the giveaway is FluffyArsonist.
FluffyArsonist, congratulations, Danoba will

1259
02:01:37,226 --> 02:01:39,969
contact you to get your information and get that
shipped out to you.

1260
02:01:39,969 --> 02:01:43,646
TRAVIS: Hard to be mad at an arsonist when they're
fluffy.

1261
02:01:43,646 --> 02:01:52,648
MATT: It's hard. All righty, so. Diving back in.
You guys were returning to Whitestone? Where were

1262
02:01:52,648 --> 02:01:53,836
you going?

1263
02:01:53,836 --> 02:01:54,821
MARISHA: Sprigg's.

1264
02:01:54,821 --> 02:02:03,001
MATT: Oh, Sprigg's cabin, correct. As the surge of
momentum comes to a halt and your feet once again

1265
02:02:03,001 --> 02:02:11,964
touch the ground here within the somewhat-charred
remains of Sprigg's cabin, you look about. The

1266
02:02:11,964 --> 02:02:20,829
crickets have taken the surrounding forest. Night
has fallen since your exit. What would you like to do?

1267
02:02:20,829 --> 02:02:24,488
TRAVIS: Are there any threatening creatures in the
vicinity?

1268
02:02:24,488 --> 02:02:26,826
MATT: Make a perception check.

1269
02:02:26,826 --> 02:02:31,656
LAURA: Can I look, too, because we'd been fighting
when we left, so I'm going to make sure--

1270
02:02:31,656 --> 02:02:35,229
TRAVIS: Don't worry, it's a 14.

1271
02:02:35,229 --> 02:02:41,525
MATT: You glance about very quickly at the
surrounding woods and trees, and aside from a

1272
02:02:41,525 --> 02:02:46,326
squirrel that scatters upon the sound of your
footfalls--

1273
02:02:46,326 --> 02:02:49,325
LAURA: Careful of traps. They're still in place.

1274
02:02:49,325 --> 02:02:52,455
TRAVIS: Yeah, the squirrel goes (running
noise, explosion).

1275
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:53,885
LAURA: Bear trap.

1276
02:02:53,885 --> 02:02:57,549
LIAM: Slams two feet above it, though.

1277
02:02:57,549 --> 02:03:02,065
TALIESIN: I'm going to go into the room and find
the nice creature that we left there.

1278
02:03:02,065 --> 02:03:08,677
MATT: As you walk amongst the rubble, you see
there, trapped within the iron cage-like manacles

1279
02:03:08,677 --> 02:03:15,484
and bindings of the small iron ball, you see the
slathering tongue of the undead entity that you

1280
02:03:15,484 --> 02:03:18,956
had entrapped. (slobbering noises)

1281
02:03:18,956 --> 02:03:25,154
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't suppose we need you any
more, do we? I'm going to take out my sword and

1282
02:03:25,154 --> 02:03:29,050
very slowly end that.

1283
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:37,141
MATT: (pained noises) You see it squeal out as you
slowly saw your way into its body until it lies

1284
02:03:37,141 --> 02:03:39,807
still once more, robbing it of its second death.

1285
02:03:39,807 --> 02:03:41,518
TALIESIN: Manners!

1286
02:03:41,518 --> 02:03:45,030
MATT: The ball retracts.

1287
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:55,877
LAURA: While he was doing that, I want to stealth
away with my brother for a moment and say, I'm

1288
02:03:55,877 --> 02:04:00,895
sorry. About everything.

1289
02:04:00,895 --> 02:04:07,187
LIAM: How far away did you just pull me?

1290
02:04:07,187 --> 02:04:10,136
LAURA: Far enough that nobody can hear us.

1291
02:04:10,136 --> 02:04:12,675
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1292
02:04:12,675 --> 02:04:21,477
LAURA: Jesus Christ. Ten. God damn it.

1293
02:04:21,477 --> 02:04:32,258
MATT: As you pull him off, you get three steps
from the building before (crash) a heavy, iron

1294
02:04:32,258 --> 02:04:35,415
bear trap snaps onto your leg.

1295
02:04:35,415 --> 02:04:38,361
TRAVIS: Outstanding!

1296
02:04:38,361 --> 02:04:40,568
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you, Matt.

1297
02:04:40,568 --> 02:04:43,965
SAM: We're basically gods.

1298
02:04:43,965 --> 02:04:46,804
(laughter)

1299
02:04:46,804 --> 02:04:48,489
TRAVIS: The words were uttered.

1300
02:04:48,489 --> 02:04:51,624
MATT: 11 points of piercing damage and you are
currently grappled.

1301
02:04:51,624 --> 02:04:53,442
LAURA: I deserved that. That's karma.

1302
02:04:53,442 --> 02:04:56,094
LIAM: Let's get it off your foot. I'll help her
pull it off.

1303
02:04:56,094 --> 02:04:58,513
MATT: Okay. Between the two of you, it takes you a
moment, but you manage to peel it off. The wounds

1304
02:04:58,513 --> 02:04:59,663
aren't too bad.

1305
02:04:59,663 --> 02:05:06,902
LIAM: I cast Lay on Hands. You're back to normal.
You're fine. Your boot's ripped up. All right,

1306
02:05:06,902 --> 02:05:09,712
watch your step. Come on. Past it all.

1307
02:05:09,712 --> 02:05:11,479
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1308
02:05:11,479 --> 02:05:12,587
LIAM: Yeah.

1309
02:05:12,587 --> 02:05:16,703
LAURA: I'm going to not move, though, because I
don't want to step on another one of those fucking

1310
02:05:16,703 --> 02:05:17,651
things.

1311
02:05:17,651 --> 02:05:21,970
MARISHA: While Keyleth chuckles about that a
little bit, I'm going to look around and find a

1312
02:05:21,970 --> 02:05:27,621
little piece to remember Sprigg by from his house
to take with me.

1313
02:05:27,621 --> 02:05:30,169
TALIESIN: I'm going to check through the books to
see if there's anything.

1314
02:05:30,169 --> 02:05:32,808
MARISHA: And then I'll help him check the books
once I've grabbed something.

1315
02:05:32,808 --> 02:05:35,730
MATT: Make an investigation check, each of you.

1316
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:41,050
TALIESIN: 22.

1317
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:42,957
MARISHA: Yours is much better than mine. Five.

1318
02:05:42,957 --> 02:05:55,627
MATT: Five. You find some elements of
partially charred pipes, some small statues that

1319
02:05:55,627 --> 02:06:05,442
were destroyed in the recent battle. You find some
unkept plants that were plotted and then left to

1320
02:06:05,442 --> 02:06:09,439
dry out. There are many things here that you could
take if you wanted to have memory of him.

1321
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:12,846
MARISHA: Does this rusty bolt represent Sprigg?

1322
02:06:12,846 --> 02:06:18,351
TALIESIN: No. I think that may have actually come
with us, that might have been us.

1323
02:06:18,351 --> 02:06:22,480
MARISHA: I'll regrow this plant later.

1324
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:24,189
MATT: There you go.

1325
02:06:24,189 --> 02:06:25,625
MARISHA: Sprigg.

1326
02:06:25,625 --> 02:06:32,441
MATT: While you search through books, you pull Vax
off to the side.

1327
02:06:32,441 --> 02:06:35,041
LIAM: Can I ask you a question?

1328
02:06:35,041 --> 02:06:36,018
LAURA: Yes.

1329
02:06:36,018 --> 02:06:47,842
LIAM: First, I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations!

1330
02:06:47,842 --> 02:06:49,708
LAURA: Thank you.

1331
02:06:49,708 --> 02:06:54,593
LIAM: I've seen it coming for a long time.

1332
02:06:54,593 --> 02:06:55,759
LAURA: I didn't.

1333
02:06:55,759 --> 02:07:12,174
LIAM: Well, you're smart in a lot of other ways.
I'm so happy; he makes you so happy, and when I

1334
02:07:12,174 --> 02:07:17,730
go, you're in good hands. And he's in good hands.
He's getting the better end of the bargain.

1335
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:30,276
LAURA: Yeah, I think so, too. I didn't plan it. If
I had, I would have told you. And then when I saw

1336
02:07:30,276 --> 02:07:42,769
you, it seemed like bad timing to say anything,
and then things kept happening. (sighs)

1337
02:07:42,769 --> 02:08:01,250
LIAM: Well, Stubby, I spent so many years standing
at your side. I guess I thought on <i>that</i> day, I'd

1338
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:05,380
be standing at your side.

1339
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:17,419
LAURA: I know. It was very spur-of-the-moment.
Nobody was standing at our side, except for each

1340
02:08:17,419 --> 02:08:19,273
other.

1341
02:08:19,273 --> 02:08:29,835
LIAM: Well, under ordinary circumstances, I would
be giving you quite an earful, but there's nothing

1342
02:08:29,835 --> 02:08:41,029
ordinary about any of this. I don't have time to
be upset at my oldest friend. I just don't have

1343
02:08:41,029 --> 02:08:52,753
time. So I love you. And I'm happy for you.

1344
02:08:52,753 --> 02:09:05,411
LAURA: I don't want you to go. I love you.

1345
02:09:05,411 --> 02:09:24,196
LIAM: You know I love you. Would you do me one
favor? When I'm gone-- I don't know, we could be

1346
02:09:24,196 --> 02:09:25,294
dead tomorrow.

1347
02:09:25,294 --> 02:09:27,739
LAURA: We could. I could die before you.

1348
02:09:27,739 --> 02:09:43,187
LIAM: She's probably going to outlast you, but
while you're around, keep her company for me?

1349
02:09:43,187 --> 02:09:46,420
LAURA: If she ever talks to me again, I swear I
will.

1350
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:51,948
LIAM: Well, what you've got going for you is you
look a lot like me. You can remind her of me once

1351
02:09:51,948 --> 02:09:53,356
in a while.

1352
02:09:53,356 --> 02:09:54,948
LAURA: Good call.

1353
02:09:54,948 --> 02:10:03,746
LIAM: Hey. It's okay. Happy for you.

1354
02:10:03,746 --> 02:10:06,036
LAURA: Thank you.

1355
02:10:06,036 --> 02:10:08,430
LIAM: Watch out for bear traps.

1356
02:10:08,430 --> 02:10:10,346
LAURA: Thank you.

1357
02:10:10,346 --> 02:10:14,247
LIAM: And I make a perception check as I walk back
by myself.

1358
02:10:14,247 --> 02:10:15,858
(laughter)

1359
02:10:15,858 --> 02:10:21,878
MATT: Yeah, you've traced your path back, you
manage to avoid the traps easily this time being

1360
02:10:21,878 --> 02:10:25,843
far more aware of the surroundings. In the
meantime, while you two are rummaging through the

1361
02:10:25,843 --> 02:10:26,885
household.

1362
02:10:26,885 --> 02:10:28,709
MARISHA: We're looking through the books, yeah.

1363
02:10:28,709 --> 02:10:30,938
TALIESIN: Looking through books.

1364
02:10:30,938 --> 02:10:35,784
MARISHA: Do you think we'll ever have gods in our
lives?

1365
02:10:35,784 --> 02:10:40,407
TALIESIN: You know...

1366
02:10:40,407 --> 02:10:48,504
MARISHA: I don't think they fancy us much. I don't
really fancy them, though, so I guess that's fair.

1367
02:10:48,504 --> 02:10:50,698
They're allowed that.

1368
02:10:50,698 --> 02:10:52,107
TALIESIN: I'm not angry.

1369
02:10:52,107 --> 02:10:53,680
MARISHA: (sighs) Me neither.

1370
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:59,702
TALIESIN: My books are still lovely, the library
is still lovely. It made a lot of things better.

1371
02:10:59,702 --> 02:11:08,009
MARISHA: You know, I felt really guilty about it
for a while, like something was wrong with me? I

1372
02:11:08,009 --> 02:11:15,075
don't understand why I didn't feel it, why I
didn't understand. I don't think it was until

1373
02:11:15,075 --> 02:11:23,197
Sarenrae and even Ioun just now mentioned that we
serve that balance and that non-believers are

1374
02:11:23,197 --> 02:11:33,787
necessary. It made me feel like a little bit less
of a fuck-up, I guess, in this whole situation.

1375
02:11:33,787 --> 02:11:38,919
TALIESIN: I think you're just fine. (laughs)
Mostly.

1376
02:11:38,919 --> 02:11:41,998
MARISHA: Apparently, you're a madman.

1377
02:11:41,998 --> 02:11:43,277
TALIESIN: Apparently.

1378
02:11:43,277 --> 02:11:44,846
MARISHA: A god called you a madman.

1379
02:11:44,846 --> 02:11:47,317
TALIESIN: I know. Honestly, I'm a little touched.

1380
02:11:47,317 --> 02:11:49,090
MARISHA: It's kind of a compliment.

1381
02:11:49,090 --> 02:12:00,184
TALIESIN: Yeah, if it weren't for the migraine.
I'm sorry, by the way. You may be the only one who

1382
02:12:00,184 --> 02:12:08,770
understands this, but I needed something that was
mine for a little while. So little of who we are

1383
02:12:08,770 --> 02:12:16,028
is ours, and I knew it would end, but it was
nice.

1384
02:12:16,028 --> 02:12:21,933
MARISHA: Wow.

1385
02:12:21,933 --> 02:12:29,102
TALIESIN: Ioun is quite a goddess, and she does
not respect secrets, though. I, on the other hand,

1386
02:12:29,102 --> 02:12:32,337
feel that secrets can be precious.

1387
02:12:32,337 --> 02:12:42,480
MARISHA: Apparently. I just don't understand why
you were still enigmatic after you already told us in

1388
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:47,869
front of Pelor. It's kind of a slap in the face.

1389
02:12:47,869 --> 02:12:54,758
TALIESIN: Well, I thought she may kill me at
that point. I was honestly fearing for my life

1390
02:12:54,758 --> 02:13:01,612
there a little bit, and at that point everything
was so awkward.

1391
02:13:01,612 --> 02:13:12,908
MARISHA: I hope you know my frustration is only
out of-- well, what you just said, I guess.

1392
02:13:12,908 --> 02:13:19,481
Wanting something to be mine that I won't have.

1393
02:13:19,481 --> 02:13:28,706
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see. I don't know.

1394
02:13:28,706 --> 02:13:33,446
MARISHA: Some things you don't get to keep.

1395
02:13:33,446 --> 02:13:38,955
TALIESIN: Yes, one of the bonuses of not being one
of the chosen of the gods is we don't have to

1396
02:13:38,955 --> 02:13:44,516
believe in destiny. We just, I think, heard a big
speech from a god about not believing in destiny.

1397
02:13:44,516 --> 02:13:50,588
MARISHA: I followed destiny my whole life. It
wasn't until I got to the end that I realized the

1398
02:13:50,588 --> 02:13:54,553
whole thing was ironic.

1399
02:13:54,553 --> 02:13:58,787
TALIESIN: Why do we have to listen to anything
they say?

1400
02:13:58,787 --> 02:14:01,831
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Cheers.

1401
02:14:01,831 --> 02:14:04,692
MARISHA: Cheers to the faithless. I kind of
inhaled a little bit.

1402
02:14:04,692 --> 02:14:12,309
TALIESIN: That was a plant. You've been holding a
plant and I've been holding a book. That got

1403
02:14:12,309 --> 02:14:13,871
weird.

1404
02:14:13,871 --> 02:14:16,313
MARISHA: I don't even know where we got these
glasses in the story.

1405
02:14:16,313 --> 02:14:18,867
TALIESIN: I think that was legitimately you were
still holding a potted plant.

1406
02:14:18,867 --> 02:14:20,988
MARISHA: Oh god. (spluttering) This coffee's been
there for a while.

1407
02:14:20,988 --> 02:14:23,988
SAM: Crudite? Crudite?

1408
02:14:23,988 --> 02:14:27,813
(laughter)

1409
02:14:27,813 --> 02:14:31,174
TALIESIN: How does it feel to be chosen by a
goddess at this point?

1410
02:14:31,174 --> 02:14:32,567
SAM: Who, me?

1411
02:14:32,567 --> 02:14:35,542
TALIESIN: Yes, you! I know you've been listening.

1412
02:14:35,542 --> 02:14:39,075
TRAVIS: No, I pull Scanlan aside.

1413
02:14:39,075 --> 02:14:41,109
TALIESIN: We all watch.

1414
02:14:41,109 --> 02:14:44,202
SAM: A moment alone, please.

1415
02:14:44,202 --> 02:14:45,721
TRAVIS: I want to see it.

1416
02:14:45,721 --> 02:14:47,106
SAM: My cube?

1417
02:14:47,106 --> 02:14:49,139
TRAVIS: No, the seed. The little bean.

1418
02:14:49,139 --> 02:14:50,405
SAM: You want to see it?

1419
02:14:50,405 --> 02:14:51,779
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to see it.

1420
02:14:51,779 --> 02:14:52,841
SAM: All right.

1421
02:14:52,841 --> 02:14:55,891
TRAVIS: Is it squishy?

1422
02:14:55,891 --> 02:14:59,312
SAM: Didn't you do this before with the other
one?

1423
02:14:59,312 --> 02:15:00,326
TRAVIS: Did I?

1424
02:15:00,326 --> 02:15:02,215
SAM: Didn't you try to squish it or something?

1425
02:15:02,215 --> 02:15:03,917
MARISHA: That was the grain of sand.

1426
02:15:03,917 --> 02:15:10,121
TRAVIS: I don't know what any of you are talking
about. Are you giving it to me? Yep. I've got it.

1427
02:15:10,121 --> 02:15:18,166
Over here. (sniffs) What does it smell like?
(deep inhale) What does it smell like?

1428
02:15:18,166 --> 02:15:20,785
MATT: Make a perception check.

1429
02:15:20,785 --> 02:15:22,320
LAURA: It's a seed of power, Grog.

1430
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:26,594
TRAVIS: Don't fucking rob me of my discovery. 11.

1431
02:15:26,594 --> 02:15:35,686
MATT: Best you can make out, it smells like dusty
tomes. It smells like old, forgotten papers and

1432
02:15:35,686 --> 02:15:37,106
parchment.

1433
02:15:37,106 --> 02:15:45,467
TRAVIS: Smells like old money. It's been tucked in
that old boob crevice. I want you to swallow the bean.

1434
02:15:45,467 --> 02:15:47,954
SAM: Swallow the bean?

1435
02:15:47,954 --> 02:15:52,861
TRAVIS: Think about Sprigg, right? His tummy was
glowing like fucking Teddy Ruxpin. I want to see

1436
02:15:52,861 --> 02:15:54,358
you swallow that shit.

1437
02:15:54,358 --> 02:16:02,153
SAM: Sure. All right, I will mime swallowing the
bean while I Wrist Pocket it.

1438
02:16:02,153 --> 02:16:06,360
TRAVIS: (gasps) Oh my god! What, are you crazy? I
was only kidding!

1439
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:10,807
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

1440
02:16:10,807 --> 02:16:18,222
SAM: Five.

1441
02:16:18,222 --> 02:16:23,676
MATT: Grog, make a perception check.

1442
02:16:23,676 --> 02:16:36,430
TRAVIS: I lose these every time, no matter how low
it is. Eight. Nope. That's a six minus one, which

1443
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:37,784
is five.

1444
02:16:37,784 --> 02:16:40,708
(laughter)

1445
02:16:40,708 --> 02:16:48,291
MATT: You all watch as he takes the small essence
stone and whispers under his breath a small

1446
02:16:48,291 --> 02:16:56,516
incantation and flicks his fingers, then it
vanishes, and he goes-- it's so overt, yet you are

1447
02:16:56,516 --> 02:16:58,748
entranced. He swallowed that thing!

1448
02:16:58,748 --> 02:17:03,781
TRAVIS: I hope you know what you're doing. Do we
get time with you before you leave?

1449
02:17:03,781 --> 02:17:06,374
SAM: I trust you 100 percent, Grog.

1450
02:17:06,374 --> 02:17:13,633
LIAM: Scanlan just did the trick I do with my kids
all the time, which is watch! One, two, three.

1451
02:17:13,633 --> 02:17:15,000
It's gone!

1452
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,089
(laughter)

1453
02:17:17,089 --> 02:17:21,316
TRAVIS: Where did that pencil go?! I pick Scanlan
up by the scruff of his neck, and I hold my ear to

1454
02:17:21,316 --> 02:17:22,652
his tummy.

1455
02:17:22,652 --> 02:17:24,294
MATT: Make a perception check.

1456
02:17:24,294 --> 02:17:27,740
TRAVIS: Nine!

1457
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:30,378
SAM: My stomach exists.

1458
02:17:30,378 --> 02:17:35,504
MATT: Yeah. You hear the occasional (grumbling).

1459
02:17:35,504 --> 02:17:40,074
TRAVIS: Oh my god. It's growing. Tell me your last
rites before you burst, if it happens.

1460
02:17:40,074 --> 02:17:43,488
SAM: I leave all of my worldly possessions to you,
Grog.

1461
02:17:43,488 --> 02:17:44,994
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Write that down, somebody?

1462
02:17:44,994 --> 02:17:47,678
LAURA: I've got it, Grog. I've got it.

1463
02:17:47,678 --> 02:17:50,694
TRAVIS: I'm holding him up like a seashell.

1464
02:17:50,694 --> 02:17:54,585
TALIESIN: Shake him a bit. It will stop the
reaction.

1465
02:17:54,585 --> 02:17:57,934
LAURA: Stop manhandling Scanlan!

1466
02:17:57,934 --> 02:17:58,954
TRAVIS: Why?

1467
02:17:58,954 --> 02:18:00,290
LAURA: Because he doesn't like it.

1468
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:01,715
TRAVIS: Do you not like it?

1469
02:18:01,715 --> 02:18:03,562
SAM: Ordinarily, yes, but not today.

1470
02:18:03,562 --> 02:18:06,290
(laughter)

1471
02:18:06,290 --> 02:18:12,009
SAM: When I pass it, I'll retrieve the item.

1472
02:18:12,009 --> 02:18:13,922
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1473
02:18:13,922 --> 02:18:15,246
SAM: Exactly.

1474
02:18:15,246 --> 02:18:18,424
TALIESIN: He's keeping it secret. Keeping it
safe.

1475
02:18:18,424 --> 02:18:20,431
TRAVIS: You lost me.

1476
02:18:20,431 --> 02:18:21,689
TALIESIN: I know.

1477
02:18:21,689 --> 02:18:24,226
LAURA: We probably need to hurry.

1478
02:18:24,226 --> 02:18:29,029
TALIESIN: This is going to be an odd request.
Let's not go to Whitestone.

1479
02:18:29,029 --> 02:18:30,252
TRAVIS: Why not?

1480
02:18:30,252 --> 02:18:31,786
TALIESIN: I feel like we're being watched.

1481
02:18:31,786 --> 02:18:32,863
LAURA: Maybe Vasselheim?

1482
02:18:32,863 --> 02:18:35,401
SAM: How did they know we were here?

1483
02:18:35,401 --> 02:18:39,007
LAURA: Why didn't we ask Ioun about that?

1484
02:18:39,007 --> 02:18:42,458
SAM: Why did you just kill the assassin guy that
we were going to ask?

1485
02:18:42,458 --> 02:18:45,323
TALIESIN: It was an undead thing. It was just
going to make a tongue at us.

1486
02:18:45,323 --> 02:18:48,880
MATT: "He wasn't really going to offer
information, anyway."

1487
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:49,761
SAM: Who are you?

1488
02:18:49,761 --> 02:18:50,775
MARISHA: Who the fuck are you?

1489
02:18:50,775 --> 02:18:52,056
TRAVIS: That's Vecna.

1490
02:18:52,056 --> 02:18:53,530
LAURA: Is that the imp?

1491
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:59,036
MATT: No. Standing by the doorway, you see there,
arms crossed, casually standing before you:

1492
02:18:59,036 --> 02:19:00,894
Vecna.

1493
02:19:00,894 --> 02:19:06,192
(shouting and screaming)

1494
02:19:06,192 --> 02:19:17,880
MATT: (laughs) "Welcome back. You must have
traveled quite a distance to be far from my sight."

1495
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:22,953
LAURA: Is he see-through? I try to shoot an arrow
at him.

1496
02:19:22,953 --> 02:19:26,191
MATT: Okay, roll for an attack.

1497
02:19:26,191 --> 02:19:27,327
LIAM: Cocked.

1498
02:19:27,327 --> 02:19:31,545
LAURA: No, that's not cocked. Cocked! 29.

1499
02:19:31,545 --> 02:19:35,115
MATT: 29. (whoosh) It passes through his body.

1500
02:19:35,115 --> 02:19:36,948
LAURA: I fucking knew it.

1501
02:19:36,948 --> 02:19:43,587
MATT: He laughs for a second, and you see him
smiling his terrible grin across curled, yellowed

1502
02:19:43,587 --> 02:19:51,153
teeth. You see that flicker of green energy
sparking in his left eye. It seems to pulse as his

1503
02:19:51,153 --> 02:20:05,037
brow arches above it. "I admire your resolve. You
did it. You solved the riddle. You found my home,

1504
02:20:05,037 --> 02:20:21,220
"ruined my tower, slew one of my greatest acolytes,
and even then, you failed. Still, impressive. That

1505
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:25,039
"is most definitely worthy of a fine round of
applause."

1506
02:20:25,039 --> 02:20:27,788
LAURA: Thank you.

1507
02:20:27,788 --> 02:20:38,765
MATT: The smug clapping comes to a halt. He nods.
"You're the only ones to get away. Others found me

1508
02:20:38,765 --> 02:20:47,043
"before you did, and another group of supposed
heroes came and assaulted me shortly after you

1509
02:20:47,043 --> 02:20:56,099
"vanished. No matter. They all failed. And rose
again."

1510
02:20:56,099 --> 02:20:58,486
TALIESIN: Perception check.

1511
02:20:58,486 --> 02:20:59,786
LAURA: Insight, maybe?

1512
02:20:59,786 --> 02:21:02,440
MARISHA: Insight. Is he fucking lying?

1513
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:05,120
MATT: Insight check? Go for it, if you want to
make one.

1514
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:07,273
LAURA: Who was it? Natural 20.

1515
02:21:07,273 --> 02:21:08,963
MARISHA: Oh yes!

1516
02:21:08,963 --> 02:21:14,925
LAURA: Thanks for double-checking. It is. Like I
would lie about a natural fucking 20.

1517
02:21:14,925 --> 02:21:17,375
LIAM: That's a six. She's lying.

1518
02:21:17,434 --> 02:21:19,611
MARISHA: 22.

1519
02:21:19,611 --> 02:21:27,225
SAM: Whispers?

1520
02:21:27,225 --> 02:21:30,805
LAURA: He's the god of secrets! What do you
expect?

1521
02:21:30,805 --> 02:21:33,000
LIAM: The pencils are adorable.

1522
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,581
MARISHA: They are so cute.

1523
02:21:34,581 --> 02:21:38,900
SAM: You know what, guys? I didn't know that this
was ever a thing.

1524
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:43,390
LIAM: You didn't know we were making pencils?
Don't you remember the holy Vox Machina text

1525
02:21:43,390 --> 02:21:44,955
thread?

1526
02:21:44,955 --> 02:21:46,707
MARISHA: We definitely sent them in the text
thread.

1527
02:21:46,707 --> 02:21:49,531
SAM: We've thrown out so many cool ideas on that
text thread.

1528
02:21:49,531 --> 02:21:57,186
LAURA: When I say, hey, name your quote on the
text thread, then you send in a quote, that means

1529
02:21:57,186 --> 02:21:59,019
it's probably pretty solid.

1530
02:21:59,019 --> 02:22:01,574
SAM: I get asked for personal quotes all the
time.

1531
02:22:01,574 --> 02:22:14,492
MATT: "Consider your path one of earned existence.
I would recommend you not waste such a rare lease

1532
02:22:14,492 --> 02:22:17,306
"on your arrogant lives."

1533
02:22:17,306 --> 02:22:25,636
LIAM: I'm going to walk right up to him while he's
talking and inspect his ugly fucking face.

1534
02:22:25,636 --> 02:22:33,620
MATT: You see through his beautifully adorned
crushed velvet robes with gold trim. You see the

1535
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:40,533
tattered edges where gems and baubles hang around
his neck. You can see the tendons and muscle that

1536
02:22:40,533 --> 02:22:46,769
are pulled taut against his skin, that is drawn
against his nearly-skeletal frame. He smiles back

1537
02:22:46,769 --> 02:22:53,346
at you, looking down from that one sickly, almost
pale blue iris and that green glowing burst of

1538
02:22:53,346 --> 02:22:56,701
energy where his other eye would be.

1539
02:22:56,701 --> 02:22:59,704
LIAM: How's that eye socket doing, friend?

1540
02:22:59,704 --> 02:23:10,895
MATT: "Well, these are the concerns of a mortal.
My vision sees far more than it once did."

1541
02:23:10,895 --> 02:23:17,006
MARISHA: While he's rambling, can Keyleth be
looking for the nearest big-ass tree?

1542
02:23:17,006 --> 02:23:23,727
MATT: Sure. There's plenty of big-ass trees in
your area.

1543
02:23:23,727 --> 02:23:25,226
TRAVIS: Booby traps.

1544
02:23:25,226 --> 02:23:27,378
MARISHA: Any clear path of least resistance?

1545
02:23:27,378 --> 02:23:29,964
MATT: Look at all these big-ass trees.

1546
02:23:29,964 --> 02:23:33,702
TALIESIN: Also, is there anybody in the forest?

1547
02:23:33,702 --> 02:23:36,642
MARISHA: Natural 19.

1548
02:23:36,642 --> 02:23:40,421
MATT: There's plenty to see, and you don't see
anybody else nearby in the forest.

1549
02:23:40,421 --> 02:23:43,256
MARISHA: Path of least resistance without traps?

1550
02:23:43,256 --> 02:23:46,107
MATT: Yeah, you see a path you can take.

1551
02:23:46,107 --> 02:23:51,005
LIAM: I'm not entirely certain I am mortal
anymore.

1552
02:23:51,005 --> 02:24:04,525
MATT: "I know what you are, and I know you know
where I am. Come to me whenever you like."

1553
02:24:04,525 --> 02:24:08,845
LIAM: Oh, fuckstick, we are coming.

1554
02:24:08,845 --> 02:24:25,476
MATT: "Are you all too bloody daft to see? It's
over. I'm no longer the Undying King. I am the

1555
02:24:25,476 --> 02:24:34,951
"King of all Kings. I am not the Scourge in Secret.
I am the Tyrant Unmatched."

1556
02:24:34,951 --> 02:24:43,866
LIAM: Yes, you're very grand. And I begin to
fingerfuck his eyehole in the illusion. So

1557
02:24:43,866 --> 02:24:44,956
majestic.

1558
02:24:44,956 --> 02:24:48,945
MATT: As soon as your finger goes forward, his
image flickers out and appears in the same room,

1559
02:24:48,945 --> 02:24:52,017
behind you, now right up against Percy and
Scanlan.

1560
02:24:52,017 --> 02:24:55,389
MARISHA: We need to go.

1561
02:24:55,389 --> 02:25:07,517
MATT: "I am Vecna the Unholy. I am god upon
Exandria. I come to play with the toys left by

1562
02:25:07,517 --> 02:25:20,019
"insolent, forgotten ancients and make this world
into a new epoch. What this means, however, is an

1563
02:25:20,019 --> 02:25:36,510
"end to all. An end to borders and nations. There
will only be the will of Vecna. So. Ask

1564
02:25:36,510 --> 02:25:49,113
"yourselves. You want peace? There is no peace, the
way things are. You all bicker and stab and murder

1565
02:25:49,113 --> 02:26:01,353
"in the names of your mothers, your fathers. But
this one? Everyone will live, and when they die,

1566
02:26:01,353 --> 02:26:14,532
"that need not be the end, either, under my banner.
I can see your every move. I know your plot. I

1567
02:26:14,532 --> 02:26:24,183
"know your destination. I know your plan, your
capabilities, your allies, and your imminent

1568
02:26:24,183 --> 02:26:38,525
"demise, should you continue. I offer you the
chance to stand down, discard your imprisoned

1569
02:26:38,525 --> 02:26:50,486
"gods, and pledge to me. Many you love will. Many
you love already have."

1570
02:26:50,486 --> 02:26:58,882
TRAVIS: (laughs) I love it when they come begging
for a truce. That means he's scared.

1571
02:26:58,882 --> 02:27:07,136
MATT: "Is it more important to throw away your
lives against an unstoppable god or to return to

1572
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:08,593
"your families--"

1573
02:27:08,593 --> 02:27:11,332
LIAM: Grog, I think you're right.

1574
02:27:11,332 --> 02:27:19,469
MATT: "If you persist, I will not only destroy
you, I will erase the memory of you ever existing

1575
02:27:19,469 --> 02:27:22,805
"from the mind of anyone you've ever known or cared
for."

1576
02:27:22,805 --> 02:27:24,728
LAURA: I don't think you have that power.

1577
02:27:24,728 --> 02:27:28,356
MATT: "Then try me."

1578
02:27:28,356 --> 02:27:35,411
TALIESIN: I think, as generous as this offer is,
we just don't enjoy associating with new money.

1579
02:27:35,411 --> 02:27:37,050
Let's get out of here now.

1580
02:27:37,050 --> 02:27:38,673
MATT: "Very well."

1581
02:27:38,673 --> 02:27:42,845
LAURA: I only serve gods with big dicks.

1582
02:27:42,845 --> 02:27:44,843
MATT: "Enjoy the forge."

1583
02:27:44,843 --> 02:27:50,593
MARISHA: I point out the path. That way! Go!

1584
02:27:50,593 --> 02:27:54,525
MATT: As the portal opens and you guys go darting
off in that direction, you hear in the distance

1585
02:27:54,525 --> 02:28:05,385
the (cackles). One after another, you all jump
through the portal, emerging?

1586
02:28:05,385 --> 02:28:07,285
MARISHA: In Vasselheim.

1587
02:28:07,285 --> 02:28:14,204
MATT: In Vasselheim. (poof noise) All of you dart
out just as the dusk sun begins to hit on the

1588
02:28:14,204 --> 02:28:16,398
distant mountains this far across the ocean.

1589
02:28:16,398 --> 02:28:18,879
MARISHA: I look around. Is there Vecna anywhere to
be seen?

1590
02:28:18,879 --> 02:28:20,148
MATT: Nowhere.

1591
02:28:20,148 --> 02:28:25,296
TALIESIN: We need sanctuary. Can you make your
mansion?

1592
02:28:25,296 --> 02:28:26,888
SAM: Right now?

1593
02:28:26,888 --> 02:28:33,142
TALIESIN: We need to rest, eventually, and you
need to commune. We'd better assume we're being

1594
02:28:33,142 --> 02:28:35,126
seen and heard at all times.

1595
02:28:35,126 --> 02:28:39,444
LAURA: I wonder if he can see us in your
dimension?

1596
02:28:39,444 --> 02:28:40,551
TALIESIN: Maybe not.

1597
02:28:40,551 --> 02:28:42,251
SAM: I don't think so.

1598
02:28:42,251 --> 02:28:43,848
TRAVIS: He said, of Exandria.

1599
02:28:43,848 --> 02:28:46,628
MARISHA: He said he couldn't see us when we were
in the library.

1600
02:28:46,628 --> 02:28:49,128
LIAM: Where do I feel him now? Same distance?

1601
02:28:49,128 --> 02:28:50,722
MATT: Same distance. Same place.

1602
02:28:50,722 --> 02:28:58,392
TALIESIN: Let's do this quick. We need to rest.
You need to talk. There's much to do, and this

1603
02:28:58,392 --> 02:29:00,922
does not feel good.

1604
02:29:00,922 --> 02:29:03,932
LAURA: Go to Raven Queen's temple right now?

1605
02:29:03,932 --> 02:29:06,016
SAM: Raven Queen or the mansion?

1606
02:29:06,016 --> 02:29:09,911
LAURA: Maybe we can do the mansion outside of her
temple?

1607
02:29:09,911 --> 02:29:10,865
SAM: Sure.

1608
02:29:10,865 --> 02:29:11,904
TALIESIN: Or even inside.

1609
02:29:11,904 --> 02:29:14,958
TRAVIS: Vasselheim doesn't take very kindly to
magic stuff.

1610
02:29:14,958 --> 02:29:17,027
LAURA: We'll be in her temple.

1611
02:29:17,027 --> 02:29:21,512
MARISHA: Aren't you also wanted here, right now?

1612
02:29:21,512 --> 02:29:26,594
TALIESIN: I will literally shoot anybody who
attempts to deal with it. Give him your hat.

1613
02:29:26,594 --> 02:29:32,115
MATT: The first thing you guys notice as you take
in your surroundings: even though dusk is

1614
02:29:32,115 --> 02:29:38,280
happening, there seems to be a larger bustle than
you're used to in Vasselheim. You begin to see

1615
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:47,545
there's a skyship at port, and a lot of the
various Bastions-- the general Bastions, the

1616
02:29:47,545 --> 02:29:52,879
volunteer army that run across much of the city--
you see them darting back and forth, carrying

1617
02:29:52,879 --> 02:29:58,780
supplies. There's a buzzing energy to the air of
the city that you haven't seen in a while.

1618
02:29:58,780 --> 02:30:00,951
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab someone, at some
point.

1619
02:30:00,951 --> 02:30:04,893
MARISHA: I did tell the Ashari to start alerting
the nearby towns.

1620
02:30:04,893 --> 02:30:09,092
MATT: You grab a gentleman who runs past you, he
has a greying beard with patches of black still,

1621
02:30:09,092 --> 02:30:14,650
his top of his head is shaved bald and you can see
a bit of a tattoo across one half of his face that

1622
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:19,349
curls into his ear. He's rushing with a cluster of
spears under one arm, and he's wearing hide armor

1623
02:30:19,349 --> 02:30:20,387
on his chest.

1624
02:30:20,387 --> 02:30:22,600
TALIESIN: You there! What is the commotion?

1625
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:25,822
MATT: "Apparently, we're gearing up for some sort
of assault."

1626
02:30:25,822 --> 02:30:27,425
TALIESIN: How soon?

1627
02:30:27,480 --> 02:30:30,567
MATT: "We don't know. We've just been told to
prepare."

1628
02:30:30,567 --> 02:30:31,679
TALIESIN: Who told?

1629
02:30:31,679 --> 02:30:33,014
SAM: Probably us.

1630
02:30:33,014 --> 02:30:34,981
TALIESIN: I just want to find out where it came
from.

1631
02:30:35,126 --> 02:30:41,105
MATT: "The chain of command from the top of the
Bastions, as well. Apparently, from some of the

1632
02:30:41,105 --> 02:30:45,699
"other temples here are speaking of some entity,
some Vecna."

1633
02:30:45,699 --> 02:30:48,575
TALIESIN: Good man. Carry on. Prepare.

1634
02:30:48,575 --> 02:30:49,975
MATT: "Very well."

1635
02:30:49,975 --> 02:30:53,077
MARISHA: I bet whenever he ascended, all the
clerics felt it.

1636
02:30:53,077 --> 02:30:55,764
LAURA: We'll be fighting undead, more than
likely.

1637
02:30:55,764 --> 02:31:03,080
MATT: "Very well." He goes to run off, two of his
compatriots stop and turn and give a slow glance

1638
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:07,121
of recognition towards Grog.

1639
02:31:07,121 --> 02:31:14,224
LAURA: Keep running. They've got bigger things
happening right now, just keep running.

1640
02:31:14,224 --> 02:31:17,955
MATT: You guys continue. They stare for a second,
then keep running, they look to be preoccupied.

1641
02:31:17,955 --> 02:31:23,859
But you get the sense that at least word of
someone matching your image has been disseminated

1642
02:31:23,859 --> 02:31:25,056
throughout the town.

1643
02:31:25,056 --> 02:31:26,487
TRAVIS: I am quite famous.

1644
02:31:26,487 --> 02:31:27,846
SAM: Do you want me to disguise you?

1645
02:31:27,846 --> 02:31:30,048
TRAVIS: Sure, why not. What am I looking like?

1646
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:31,724
SAM: Take this hat--

1647
02:31:31,724 --> 02:31:33,863
TRAVIS: I have to attune to it; it takes forever.

1648
02:31:33,863 --> 02:31:39,865
SAM: Fuck! All right, I'll cast Seeming on you. On
all of us. Because I can.

1649
02:31:39,865 --> 02:31:42,347
TRAVIS: Will you make me look like Tary?

1650
02:31:42,347 --> 02:31:43,985
LAURA: No, what?

1651
02:31:43,985 --> 02:31:45,214
(laughter)

1652
02:31:45,214 --> 02:31:48,069
LAURA: That's not smart!

1653
02:31:48,069 --> 02:31:50,624
TRAVIS: Well, it's not like he was in the room
where it happened.

1654
02:31:50,624 --> 02:31:52,327
TALIESIN: The room where it happened?

1655
02:31:52,327 --> 02:31:53,953
MATT: The room where it happened.

1656
02:31:53,953 --> 02:31:56,064
LAURA: Keep running toward the Raven Queen temple
as that's happening.

1657
02:31:56,064 --> 02:32:00,653
MARISHA: We should probably try and use our words
as much as possible.

1658
02:32:00,653 --> 02:32:05,123
SAM: Blue and a foot smaller, like Blue Man Group.
Black clothes, blue face, bald.

1659
02:32:05,123 --> 02:32:11,218
MATT: So you have a little more of an aasimar
appearance, though a larger one than you've seen.

1660
02:32:11,218 --> 02:32:18,892
(laughter)

1661
02:32:18,892 --> 02:32:21,490
MATT: All right, where are you guys charging off
to?

1662
02:32:21,545 --> 02:32:23,547
LIAM: Yeah, Raven Queen temple.

1663
02:32:23,547 --> 02:32:29,649
MATT: Okay, you're heading to the Raven's Crest.
All right. You make your way to the--

1664
02:32:29,649 --> 02:32:32,921
MARISHA: I'm going to keep looking around, make
sure no one's tailing us.

1665
02:32:32,921 --> 02:32:35,187
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

1666
02:32:35,187 --> 02:32:41,897
MARISHA: 21.

1667
02:32:41,897 --> 02:32:48,339
MATT: 21? All right. Keeping an eye out, you don't
see anybody following you at the moment. That does

1668
02:32:48,339 --> 02:32:55,602
not appear to be an issue. So you head to the area
of the Duskmeadow, to the southeast of the city.

1669
02:32:55,602 --> 02:33:01,494
You come through the dry, cold, and dusty sector.
A little bit of snow appears to have melted into

1670
02:33:01,494 --> 02:33:06,318
slush at the corners, but most of it has been
pushed off the main roads to the side. You see

1671
02:33:06,318 --> 02:33:14,637
dirty snow matted at the edges. You follow Vax
very quickly through the streets, and you see a

1672
02:33:14,637 --> 02:33:22,579
few of the veiled maidens of the Raven's Crest
aerie taking note of you. And as you approach,

1673
02:33:22,579 --> 02:33:27,449
they just point over to the Raven's Crest silently
as you walk past.

1674
02:33:27,449 --> 02:33:29,460
LAURA: Quickly. Quickly walk past.

1675
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:33,621
LIAM: I'm going to walk up the steps and push open
the door.

1676
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:38,390
MATT: You're coming from the other side as opposed
to the main entrance so you rush past the hall

1677
02:33:38,390 --> 02:33:41,579
that goes, which is the Grand Library that's
attached to the Raven's Crest.

1678
02:33:41,579 --> 02:33:42,858
LIAM: Everybody's with me, right?

1679
02:33:42,858 --> 02:33:46,978
MATT: Yeah, And you come to the front doors, they
are closed currently, but you have two of the

1680
02:33:47,030 --> 02:33:51,697
maidens there at the front, and as you begin to
turn from the side, they glance over and give

1681
02:33:51,697 --> 02:33:59,819
notice, and then turn and push the doors open in
preparation. With that, you all enter Raven's

1682
02:33:59,819 --> 02:34:06,591
Crest itself, and looking within, you can see the
beautiful interior of carved obsidians and gold

1683
02:34:06,591 --> 02:34:15,573
trims and sigils that are marked and pushed
throughout the interior of this structure. Are you

1684
02:34:15,573 --> 02:34:17,068
leading them to the central chamber?

1685
02:34:17,068 --> 02:34:18,968
LIAM: Yeah, I'm bringing everybody with me.

1686
02:34:18,968 --> 02:34:24,679
MATT: Okay. No one stops you, and as you head up
these stairs into the second chamber and then

1687
02:34:24,679 --> 02:34:29,910
finally to the large set of doorways that lead you
into the central communion chamber of Raven's Crest, you

1688
02:34:29,929 --> 02:34:36,826
guys enter to this beautiful room that is
surrounded in stained glass imagery of varying

1689
02:34:36,826 --> 02:34:44,222
colors, largely in dark purples and reds, blues,
and in the center you see a large, circular pool

1690
02:34:44,222 --> 02:34:52,197
where a deep crimson liquid sits perfectly still,
familiar to both Percival and Vax'ildan.

1691
02:34:52,197 --> 02:35:02,034
LIAM: I walk over to Keyleth. We need to talk. And
I plant a big fucking kiss on her mouth, and then

1692
02:35:02,034 --> 02:35:07,491
I turn to the rest of the group and say, nobody
fucking touches me, do you understand?

1693
02:35:07,491 --> 02:35:09,310
TRAVIS: Where are you going?

1694
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:10,351
LAURA: Understood.

1695
02:35:10,351 --> 02:35:14,434
LIAM: I walk in, and I inhale as deeply as I can
as I shove my face into the blood.

1696
02:35:14,434 --> 02:35:16,587
LAURA: I hold Trinket back so that he doesn't go
after him.

1697
02:35:16,587 --> 02:35:17,736
MATT: Okay.

1698
02:35:17,736 --> 02:35:20,916
MARISHA: I watch on the side and don't take my
eyes off of him.

1699
02:35:20,916 --> 02:35:25,619
MATT: Okay. Pike instinctually walks up to the
very edge but avoids touching any of the liquid.

1700
02:35:25,619 --> 02:35:37,280
As you watch Vax just (bloop noise) disappear into
this thick liquid, no bubbles rise, you see a bit

1701
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:41,262
of movement from thrashing beneath the surface and
then stillness.

1702
02:35:41,262 --> 02:35:46,921
MARISHA: Is this what he goes through every time?

1703
02:35:46,921 --> 02:35:48,328
TALIESIN: This is normal.

1704
02:35:48,328 --> 02:35:49,665
TRAVIS: Is he a vampire?

1705
02:35:49,665 --> 02:35:51,049
TALIESIN: He is not a vampire.

1706
02:35:51,049 --> 02:35:53,181
SAM: I think he's dead. I think he died in there.

1707
02:35:53,181 --> 02:35:55,580
TALIESIN: I don't think that's how it works.

1708
02:35:55,580 --> 02:35:57,955
LAURA: But I do think he's dead.

1709
02:35:57,955 --> 02:36:00,153
SAM: He's undead, isn't he? He's a zombie.

1710
02:36:00,153 --> 02:36:01,520
TALIESIN: He's not a zombie.

1711
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:07,126
MARISHA: His flesh is cold, but his heart still
beats.

1712
02:36:07,126 --> 02:36:14,848
MATT: Vax'ildan. As the panic and pain subsides,
much easier now than it was your previous

1713
02:36:14,848 --> 02:36:22,307
ventures, into this communion, the darkness
surrounds you, familiar, but you are intent, and

1714
02:36:22,307 --> 02:36:31,084
you are driven. The very force of your
conversation is pushed out from your personality

1715
02:36:31,084 --> 02:36:37,522
into this ether, this surrounding, infinite void,
and a familiar voice comes.

1716
02:36:37,522 --> 02:36:46,665
"You burn with intent, my feathered boy."

1717
02:36:46,665 --> 02:36:48,729
LIAM: We need to talk.

1718
02:36:48,729 --> 02:36:54,023
MATT: "Then talk we shall. Speak your mind." You
still see nothing around you, it's just the voice

1719
02:36:54,023 --> 02:36:55,733
from the darkness.

1720
02:36:55,733 --> 02:37:03,393
LIAM: We were too late to stop him. Vecna.

1721
02:37:03,393 --> 02:37:05,998
MATT: "I sensed it, yes."

1722
02:37:05,998 --> 02:37:22,790
LIAM: This dead man who wanted to be a god is now
a fucking god. We have been speaking to your

1723
02:37:22,790 --> 02:37:38,874
brothers and sisters, your <i>found</i> family, and
they are arming us with what we need to fight your

1724
02:37:38,874 --> 02:37:55,949
foe. You know who he is. He is upon us and I have
come to you for aid. And as I have learned, he is

1725
02:37:55,949 --> 02:38:12,213
somewhat akin to you. He was one of us and has
ascended, like you.

1726
02:38:12,213 --> 02:38:29,476
MATT: "He is no kin to me. He is a trier. He is a
copycat. He ascends for selfish reasons, whereas I

1727
02:38:29,476 --> 02:38:42,709
"was merely following my destiny. He will be
destroyed. You have the tools. You have the means.

1728
02:38:42,709 --> 02:38:55,151
"The weave is tangled before us. The threads grow
knotted, hard to follow. But yours still glows so

1729
02:38:55,151 --> 02:39:00,260
"bright into that terrible knot."

1730
02:39:00,260 --> 02:39:12,628
LIAM: This thing. This man is your enemy, yes?

1731
02:39:12,628 --> 02:39:16,636
MATT: "As he is the enemy of all things."

1732
02:39:16,636 --> 02:39:24,623
LIAM: Agreed. I have come here seeking power.

1733
02:39:24,623 --> 02:39:29,763
MATT: "You have my blessing already."

1734
02:39:29,763 --> 02:39:45,418
LIAM: What of these trammels? These fragments of
divinity. Have you that in you?

1735
02:39:45,418 --> 02:39:56,780
MATT: "I do not know much of these trammels but
that they were used. But I fear that is beyond my

1736
02:39:56,780 --> 02:40:03,524
"knowledge. The Knowing Mistress would be the one
to speak to."

1737
02:40:03,524 --> 02:40:07,143
LIAM: We have.

1738
02:40:07,143 --> 02:40:12,116
MATT: "Then what do you need of me?"

1739
02:40:12,116 --> 02:40:25,546
LIAM: We need to power trammels. The Dawnfather,
the Knowing Mistress have contributed to our

1740
02:40:25,546 --> 02:40:40,738
cause, to your cause, these seeds of power. I had
hoped you could offer the same.

1741
02:40:40,738 --> 02:40:50,786
MATT: At this point, you feel a finger trace
across your chin from behind. You feel an arm, the

1742
02:40:50,786 --> 02:40:57,923
weight resting on your shoulder, and it pulls and
turns you around, and as you spin, you come face

1743
02:40:57,923 --> 02:41:04,327
to face with the porcelain mask you are so
familiar with. As the hand still holds the edge of

1744
02:41:04,327 --> 02:41:16,035
your cheek and your shoulder, "Am I to believe
that this is not some ploy to diminish my power

1745
02:41:16,035 --> 02:41:23,660
"and leave me vulnerable to cast me from my seat?"

1746
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:33,615
LIAM: I thought you knew me inside and out.

1747
02:41:33,615 --> 02:41:41,388
MATT: "I know you, but do you know them? Do you
think I've been welcome since I entered this

1748
02:41:41,388 --> 02:41:52,214
"pantheon? My existence is perpetually a threat to
the creators. If anything, part of this burden

1749
02:41:52,214 --> 02:42:06,231
"that we all face lies on my shoulders, as well.
Why would they not think to strike at two birds

1750
02:42:06,231 --> 02:42:12,821
"with one stone?" At which point, you watch the
feathers of her dress furl out a bit, like a bird

1751
02:42:12,821 --> 02:42:14,864
that's hit a chill.

1752
02:42:14,864 --> 02:42:31,594
LIAM: Well, it depends on you, then, and how much
you want this wretch taken down.

1753
02:42:31,594 --> 02:42:42,742
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1754
02:42:42,742 --> 02:42:47,741
LIAM: 18.

1755
02:42:47,741 --> 02:43:07,900
MATT: There's a long, silent stare. "I put my
faith in you, my fate-touched. Do not forget that.

1756
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:16,660
"And all I ask is you put all your faith in me."

1757
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:23,233
LIAM: You have it.

1758
02:43:23,233 --> 02:43:37,553
MATT: "Then I shall watch your thread. Now wake
up." In that instant, everything goes black once

1759
02:43:37,553 --> 02:43:45,286
more, and you feel the pain, the heat in your
lungs, but then it subsides quickly, and you stay

1760
02:43:45,286 --> 02:43:55,910
there beneath the familiar, thick surface of the
blood. No need for air.

1761
02:43:55,910 --> 02:44:01,806
TRAVIS: You're just chilling like a villain under
the blood?!

1762
02:44:01,806 --> 02:44:04,588
SAM: (whispering) He can breathe blood!

1763
02:44:04,588 --> 02:44:09,087
MATT: The instinct to breathe is still there, but
you realize after a moment of panic that it's not

1764
02:44:09,087 --> 02:44:11,224
necessary.

1765
02:44:11,224 --> 02:44:13,612
LIAM: Do I have what I came for?

1766
02:44:13,612 --> 02:44:18,061
MATT: You can't see. Your body is clenched tight.
Your muscles are still tense.

1767
02:44:18,061 --> 02:44:21,051
LIAM: Okay, I'll move up.

1768
02:44:21,051 --> 02:44:27,018
MATT: You guys, after waiting for about 30
minutes, it feels like, of tense silence, you

1769
02:44:27,018 --> 02:44:33,362
watch as the surface of the pool (splashing)
splashes upwards as a crimson Vax comes to the

1770
02:44:33,362 --> 02:44:42,549
surface. Not gasping for breath. Just
stoic, as he comes to the edge of the pool, step

1771
02:44:42,549 --> 02:44:52,991
after step, dripping the blood with each footprint
on the ground. Your fist hurts a bit from the

1772
02:44:52,991 --> 02:45:02,879
tightness, but as you unfurl your fingers you look
down and see a small, onyx opal. It's a stone

1773
02:45:02,879 --> 02:45:13,336
about the size of a gem that big on your hand.

1774
02:45:13,336 --> 02:45:15,899
TRAVIS: That is a big bean.

1775
02:45:15,899 --> 02:45:18,663
LIAM: I need a bath.

1776
02:45:18,663 --> 02:45:22,508
TALIESIN: Do we want to try and make one more
jump?

1777
02:45:22,508 --> 02:45:26,013
TRAVIS: Just a minute. I have a question. How many
times have you done that?

1778
02:45:26,013 --> 02:45:30,850
LIAM: Six.

1779
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:34,125
TRAVIS: My gods.

1780
02:45:34,125 --> 02:45:35,816
TALIESIN: Once.

1781
02:45:35,816 --> 02:45:41,036
SAM: This has been the craziest 48 hours of my
life.

1782
02:45:41,036 --> 02:45:47,654
(laughter)

1783
02:45:47,654 --> 02:45:51,506
SAM: I mean... wow, guys.

1784
02:45:51,506 --> 02:45:53,758
LIAM: Campaign in 48 hours.

1785
02:45:53,758 --> 02:45:57,714
SAM: Wow. I could've just been chilling...

1786
02:45:57,714 --> 02:46:02,074
TALIESIN: You've made some bad decisions, haven't
you?

1787
02:46:02,074 --> 02:46:07,228
LIAM: I just stand clutching a gem dripping blood,
looking at the love of my life.

1788
02:46:07,228 --> 02:46:09,360
MARISHA: I kiss him back through the blood.

1789
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:11,574
(groaning)

1790
02:46:11,574 --> 02:46:15,466
MARISHA: Fuck you, you kiss your bear on the
mouth!

1791
02:46:15,466 --> 02:46:20,406
MATT: It looks like Keyleth had some barbecue and
wasn't paying attention.

1792
02:46:20,406 --> 02:46:22,558
TRAVIS: We don't know where that blood's from!

1793
02:46:22,558 --> 02:46:24,494
MARISHA: That's love, y'all.

1794
02:46:24,494 --> 02:46:28,141
LIAM: I was not expecting that.

1795
02:46:28,141 --> 02:46:32,500
MARISHA: You did it.

1796
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:38,387
LIAM: (whispering) I'm sorry.

1797
02:46:38,387 --> 02:46:40,843
MARISHA: Okay, all right, let's clean you up.

1798
02:46:40,843 --> 02:46:43,959
TALIESIN: Do we want to try and run one more time
before we--

1799
02:46:43,959 --> 02:46:45,479
SAM and LAURA: Run where?

1800
02:46:45,479 --> 02:46:49,632
TALIESIN: Well, into the forge, I suppose. Find
the sword, head to the forge.

1801
02:46:49,632 --> 02:46:52,199
SAM: How do we get to the forge? There's no trees
there.

1802
02:46:52,199 --> 02:46:55,369
TRAVIS: I have a thought, right? Do we give a shit
about Kord at all, or no?

1803
02:46:55,369 --> 02:47:00,179
SAM: It would be great to have a fourth bean, but
we're on a ticking time clock.

1804
02:47:00,179 --> 02:47:05,639
LIAM: Yeah, I like the idea of the Kord bean, but
I really want to go to bed.

1805
02:47:05,639 --> 02:47:10,048
TALIESIN: Let's set up camp, and if you feel like
you want to make one last--

1806
02:47:10,048 --> 02:47:12,755
TRAVIS: I'll ask. He might just say no.

1807
02:47:12,755 --> 02:47:17,626
MARISHA: We don't even know where to find him,
though. We're running out of time.

1808
02:47:17,626 --> 02:47:23,459
TRAVIS: Yep. It's right here. It's like popping
into Blockbuster when you go to the grocery store.

1809
02:47:23,459 --> 02:47:25,253
Might as well see what's up.

1810
02:47:25,253 --> 02:47:26,805
SAM: Blockbuster?

1811
02:47:26,805 --> 02:47:28,561
LAURA: Redbox, maybe.

1812
02:47:28,561 --> 02:47:31,318
TRAVIS: No, Blockbuster. Where are you from?

1813
02:47:31,318 --> 02:47:33,415
SAM: Errol's Video.

1814
02:47:33,415 --> 02:47:43,046
TALIESIN: 20/20. Do we want to set up shop here or
do we want to set up shop in the temple of Kord?

1815
02:47:43,046 --> 02:47:46,562
LAURA: I think here. I feel like we're safe here.

1816
02:47:46,562 --> 02:47:50,308
TRAVIS: I mean, we got free reign. We got backstage
passes. Everybody's like, "right through here!"

1817
02:47:50,308 --> 02:47:55,731
TALIESIN: I think honestly here they'll have
difficulty identifying which of our blood is

1818
02:47:55,731 --> 02:47:57,399
going to be splattered on the ground.

1819
02:47:57,399 --> 02:48:00,129
LIAM: And I'm good with management, I think we
can... yeah.

1820
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:01,351
TALIESIN: Let's sleep here.

1821
02:48:01,351 --> 02:48:02,924
TRAVIS: Yeah, you seem to be super tight with--

1822
02:48:02,924 --> 02:48:06,426
LAURA: Do you want to head over to Kord's temple
as well? I have a feeling if we find him, we'll

1823
02:48:06,426 --> 02:48:08,201
have to go to another plane.

1824
02:48:08,201 --> 02:48:16,923
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was my (stammers) assess, as
well.

1825
02:48:16,923 --> 02:48:18,386
LAURA: Yeah.

1826
02:48:18,386 --> 02:48:25,910
MARISHA: If you want to go do a little bit of
footwork and see what it might take to get there,

1827
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:34,842
I can rest and try and get us there. Remember, you
have to find a tuning fork, though, that is

1828
02:48:34,842 --> 02:48:36,869
attuned to the specific plane.

1829
02:48:36,869 --> 02:48:39,439
TALIESIN: You're speaking words that he doesn't--

1830
02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:46,359
MARISHA: You need a magical vibrating fork that is
connected to the vibrating plane of Kord.

1831
02:48:46,359 --> 02:48:48,574
TALIESIN: He doesn't know what that word means.

1832
02:48:48,574 --> 02:48:51,331
TRAVIS: I was just going to go speak to
Earthbreaker Groon. I don't know what's so hard

1833
02:48:51,331 --> 02:48:53,680
about that. He gave me these gloves last time.

1834
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:59,641
MARISHA: Right. I'm just letting you know the
prerequisites so you can ask the right questions.

1835
02:48:59,641 --> 02:49:00,823
Just go.

1836
02:49:00,823 --> 02:49:02,644
LAURA: I'll go. I'll go with him.

1837
02:49:02,644 --> 02:49:03,858
TRAVIS: Am I still blue?

1838
02:49:03,858 --> 02:49:06,793
SAM: You're still blue, and you still look like
Blue Man Group, so do you want me to go with you

1839
02:49:06,793 --> 02:49:09,319
so that I can undo that when we get there?

1840
02:49:09,319 --> 02:49:11,007
TRAVIS: Yeah, you tweedles want to come?

1841
02:49:11,007 --> 02:49:12,182
LAURA: Yeah.

1842
02:49:12,182 --> 02:49:14,120
SAM: Or do you want to talk to him blue?

1843
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:17,269
TRAVIS: No, I want to be blue. Yeah. I want to
stay blue.

1844
02:49:17,269 --> 02:49:19,873
SAM: But when you talk to Groon do you want to be
blue?

1845
02:49:19,873 --> 02:49:21,388
TRAVIS: Yeah you can dissipate, right?

1846
02:49:21,388 --> 02:49:22,805
SAM: So I'll come with you.

1847
02:49:22,805 --> 02:49:26,150
TRAVIS: Yeah. That cool?

1848
02:49:26,150 --> 02:49:27,507
LAURA: Yeah.

1849
02:49:27,507 --> 02:49:37,664
TRAVIS: You guys rest. I'm going to go find us a
bean of strength and might and sex appeal. Can I

1850
02:49:37,664 --> 02:49:39,376
go to the temple of Kord?

1851
02:49:39,376 --> 02:49:41,706
MATT: Yeah. You guys make your way.

1852
02:49:41,706 --> 02:49:43,947
SAM: Am I making a mansion for the rest of you?

1853
02:49:43,947 --> 02:49:49,363
LAURA: That would be smart. I feel like the
mansion is the smartest thing because it's not--

1854
02:49:49,363 --> 02:49:51,672
TRAVIS: They don't have Raven Queen cots or
something?

1855
02:49:51,672 --> 02:49:54,554
LAURA: We don't know; Vecna could still see in
here.

1856
02:49:54,554 --> 02:49:56,970
MARISHA: Oh, that's true. You're right.

1857
02:49:56,970 --> 02:49:59,985
SAM: All right. Mansion. Enjoy yourselves.

1858
02:49:59,985 --> 02:50:03,671
MATT: You create the shimmering doorway, and you
guys come into the mansion without issue.

1859
02:50:03,671 --> 02:50:06,052
MARISHA and LIAM: To the spa!

1860
02:50:06,052 --> 02:50:13,457
SAM: I'll don the hat so I turn into the Meat Man
so that no one can recognize me.

1861
02:50:13,457 --> 02:50:19,125
MATT: Okay. The three of you make your way to the
Braving Grounds.

1862
02:50:19,125 --> 02:50:24,259
LAURA: As we're walking, I want to whisper to
Scanlan. I'm going to whisper to the Meat Man's

1863
02:50:24,259 --> 02:50:26,609
crotch because that's about even, right?

1864
02:50:26,609 --> 02:50:28,173
SAM: I think he's a little bigger.

1865
02:50:28,173 --> 02:50:38,007
LAURA: Then I'll whisper to his waistline. The
sword that Ioun was talking about, right, the

1866
02:50:38,007 --> 02:50:38,831
Sword of Kas?

1867
02:50:38,831 --> 02:50:41,669
SAM: (Meat Man voice) The Sword of Kas, yes.

1868
02:50:41,669 --> 02:50:49,601
LAURA: Do you think it could possibly the sword
that Grog had?

1869
02:50:49,601 --> 02:50:56,511
SAM: The thought did occur to me, yes, but there
are big differences.

1870
02:50:56,511 --> 02:50:58,917
LAURA: Do you know for sure?

1871
02:50:58,917 --> 02:51:04,035
SAM: Well, Ioun did not talk about a talking
sword, for one.

1872
02:51:04,035 --> 02:51:09,259
LAURA: Well, no, but she didn't say it wasn't a
talking sword. She said it was a vengeful sword.

1873
02:51:09,259 --> 02:51:15,148
SAM: Do you think we should go get it to make
sure? We should have asked for some sort of

1874
02:51:15,148 --> 02:51:16,664
identifying feature.

1875
02:51:16,664 --> 02:51:20,050
LAURA: We really should have. Maybe we could ask
the sword.

1876
02:51:20,050 --> 02:51:22,333
SAM: She said, "Do you have any more questions?"

1877
02:51:22,333 --> 02:51:27,677
LAURA: And we didn't. But maybe if we see that
sword, we can be like, "Hey, do you know who Kas is?"

1878
02:51:27,677 --> 02:51:29,940
and if he does, then we're like, "Oh fuck!"

1879
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:33,461
SAM: You want to go visit Craven Edge?

1880
02:51:33,461 --> 02:51:39,130
LAURA: I'm saying this quietly. I don't want
Grog to realize we're doing this. He has a thing

1881
02:51:39,130 --> 02:51:40,979
for Craven Edge.

1882
02:51:40,979 --> 02:51:42,767
SAM: I held the sword once.

1883
02:51:42,767 --> 02:51:44,069
LAURA: You did?

1884
02:51:44,069 --> 02:51:47,159
SAM: I have a thing for Craven Edge, as well.

1885
02:51:47,159 --> 02:51:50,791
LAURA: Oh fuck. Oh shit.

1886
02:51:50,791 --> 02:51:54,652
MATT: Make an intelligence roll, actually. Roll a
d20, add your intelligence modifier plus one

1887
02:51:54,652 --> 02:51:57,430
because you have a permanent plus two to your
intelligence.

1888
02:51:57,430 --> 02:52:02,780
SAM: Intelligence check? 11.

1889
02:52:02,780 --> 02:52:08,523
LIAM: Your intelligence is higher now, after Ioun.
Don't forget your Ioun papers!

1890
02:52:08,523 --> 02:52:13,360
SAM: Eight plus two, plus one is 11.

1891
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:15,177
LIAM: Oh god!

1892
02:52:15,177 --> 02:52:16,886
MATT: Okay, continue.

1893
02:52:16,886 --> 02:52:19,661
LAURA: Continue. You didn't pass the test.

1894
02:52:19,661 --> 02:52:22,949
SAM: I mean, do I get to add my Jack of All
Trades?

1895
02:52:22,949 --> 02:52:24,402
MATT: Yeah. Plus three.

1896
02:52:24,402 --> 02:52:25,701
SAM: 14!

1897
02:52:25,701 --> 02:52:27,962
LAURA: Anything?

1898
02:52:27,962 --> 02:52:30,888
MATT: Nothing. Continue.

1899
02:52:30,888 --> 02:52:39,897
SAM: It was a very powerful sword, but perhaps
it's worth a check. How do we get there? We'll

1900
02:52:39,941 --> 02:52:42,654
have to talk to Keyleth about it.

1901
02:52:42,654 --> 02:52:51,152
MARISHA: I don't think the timelines match. But I
could be wrong. I'm not there.

1902
02:52:51,152 --> 02:52:56,773
LAURA: Delilah Briarwood, Lord Briarwood had the
sword, they were seeking Vecna.

1903
02:52:56,773 --> 02:52:58,900
LIAM: That's where they got that shit.

1904
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:01,670
LAURA: It could work out.

1905
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:08,903
MARISHA: But they were making out like Vecna had
this sword while we had Craven Edge, right?

1906
02:53:08,903 --> 02:53:12,284
LAURA: Vecna doesn't have the sword right now--

1907
02:53:12,284 --> 02:53:18,622
MATT: No one's seen the Sword of Kas since Vecna
was destroyed along with Kas.

1908
02:53:18,622 --> 02:53:24,690
LAURA: Exactly! Craven Edge could be the Sword of
Kas.

1909
02:53:24,690 --> 02:53:27,624
LIAM: It got lost and was refound.

1910
02:53:27,624 --> 02:53:30,704
LAURA: By the Briarwoods. They were going to
awaken him, but then he died.

1911
02:53:30,704 --> 02:53:32,277
SAM: Or it's just a sword.

1912
02:53:32,277 --> 02:53:34,154
LAURA: Or it's just a sword that just likes
blood.

1913
02:53:34,154 --> 02:53:35,661
LIAM: We've got to do something.

1914
02:53:35,661 --> 02:53:36,710
TRAVIS: Can we go?!

1915
02:53:36,710 --> 02:53:43,153
LAURA: Sorry, Grog. Yes, of course. We're walking.
We're doing this while we walk. We're not wasting

1916
02:53:43,153 --> 02:53:45,798
time with this conversation. We're traveling with
this conversation.

1917
02:53:45,798 --> 02:53:47,282
TRAVIS: I didn't realize.

1918
02:53:47,282 --> 02:53:49,249
SAM: We'll ask Keyleth when we get back.

1919
02:53:49,249 --> 02:53:52,520
LAURA: Okay. We sent it to the plane of the Dread
Emperor.

1920
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:54,154
SAM: She knows how to get there.

1921
02:53:54,154 --> 02:53:58,978
MATT: You guys make your way through the Proving
Grounds. Where are you heading to specifically?

1922
02:53:58,978 --> 02:54:04,514
TRAVIS: To the temple of Kord. Big man outside.
The Trial Forge with the big doors.

1923
02:54:04,514 --> 02:54:10,220
MATT: You make your way to the Trial Forge. The
doors are currently closed, it is mid-evening at

1924
02:54:10,220 --> 02:54:14,963
this point. It's probably, at this point, with the
communion and you guys making your way across the

1925
02:54:14,963 --> 02:54:17,691
city? Yeah, it's close to midnight.

1926
02:54:17,691 --> 02:54:23,124
TRAVIS: Nice. (loud knocking)

1927
02:54:23,124 --> 02:54:32,171
MATT: Your knocks are very loud and easily heard.
About 20 seconds later (door opening) begin to

1928
02:54:32,171 --> 02:54:37,258
open. You hear the cinching of chains as the doors
are pulled open ever so slightly. One of the monks

1929
02:54:37,258 --> 02:54:43,611
of Kord arrives at the front, sees you, recognizes
you with a bit of glance.

1930
02:54:43,611 --> 02:54:45,048
SAM: He's blue.

1931
02:54:45,048 --> 02:54:47,501
MATT: Oh, that's right. Does not recognize you.

1932
02:54:47,501 --> 02:54:55,696
TRAVIS: I apologize for the late flower. Don't be
confused. It's me, Grog Strongjaw, wielder of the

1933
02:54:55,696 --> 02:55:00,299
Titanstone Knuckles. (whispers) I'm
in-cog-Cheeto.

1934
02:55:00,299 --> 02:55:10,910
SAM: I will drop the form of Grog.

1935
02:55:10,910 --> 02:55:17,831
MATT: Yeah. "Very well. Can I help you?"

1936
02:55:17,831 --> 02:55:24,764
TRAVIS: Yeah, I seek an audience with Earthbreaker
Groon. Very important. It pertains to the

1937
02:55:24,764 --> 02:55:26,691
emergence of Vecna.

1938
02:55:26,691 --> 02:55:31,935
MATT: "All right. This may coordinate with his
current effort. Very well. Please enter."

1939
02:55:31,935 --> 02:55:34,156
SAM: Can we come in?

1940
02:55:34,156 --> 02:55:37,988
MATT: You guys make your way in.

1941
02:55:37,988 --> 02:55:40,624
SAM: I am a legitimate businessman.

1942
02:55:40,624 --> 02:55:44,732
MATT: "I am very curious as to why you are here,
then."

1943
02:55:44,732 --> 02:55:47,596
SAM: For business dealings.

1944
02:55:47,596 --> 02:55:49,922
MATT: "You walk with Vox Machina."

1945
02:55:49,922 --> 02:55:53,090
SAM: I shouldn't have said anything.

1946
02:55:53,090 --> 02:55:58,041
(laughter)

1947
02:55:58,041 --> 02:56:04,133
MATT: You walk through the halls, your footfalls
echoing across the stone floor. The large archways

1948
02:56:04,133 --> 02:56:11,001
and the pillars. It is very quiet. As you approach
the edge of the central sandpit, in the center you

1949
02:56:11,001 --> 02:56:19,209
see Groon, currently sitting in meditation with
something drawn in the sand with a finger. Some

1950
02:56:19,209 --> 02:56:21,040
sort of a sketch.

1951
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:22,830
TRAVIS: May I approach?

1952
02:56:22,830 --> 02:56:29,917
MATT: The head, facing away from you, picks up a
bit. "You may."

1953
02:56:29,917 --> 02:56:33,908
TRAVIS: (jumping and landing) Three-point stance.

1954
02:56:33,908 --> 02:56:40,012
MATT: Slowly stands up and brushes sand from the
hands. Not turning, but just looking over the

1955
02:56:40,012 --> 02:56:45,915
shoulder ever so slightly at you. 
"What brings you to the temple at this hour?"

1956
02:56:45,915 --> 02:56:49,309
TRAVIS: We have urgent business-- what are you
drawing there?

1957
02:56:49,309 --> 02:56:52,335
MATT: "Finish your statement."

1958
02:56:52,335 --> 02:57:03,014
TRAVIS: Right, sorry. We come with grim tidings.
Vecna is at large, and we mean to take him down.

1959
02:57:03,014 --> 02:57:12,618
MATT: "I know only what I've been told. We are
gathering the monks for defense of the city.

1960
02:57:12,618 --> 02:57:24,333
"Awaiting orders. I'm trying to meditate on where
this danger is."

1961
02:57:24,333 --> 02:57:33,389
TRAVIS: We have a theory. We think he might be
originating in Wildemount? No.

1962
02:57:33,389 --> 02:57:42,648
LAURA: We don't know where he is exactly--
(stammering) We've been speaking to the gods.

1963
02:57:42,648 --> 02:57:47,116
TRAVIS: You might want to talk through me. I'm his most
prized pupil.

1964
02:57:47,135 --> 02:57:49,709
LAURA: I'm going to stand next to Grog while I say
this.

1965
02:57:49,709 --> 02:57:51,149
TRAVIS: In the sandpit?

1966
02:57:51,149 --> 02:57:56,187
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to fly down to the sandpit
and land next to Grog.

1967
02:57:56,187 --> 02:57:59,021
TRAVIS: Lady Vex'ahlia. Great fighter, very
brave.

1968
02:57:59,021 --> 02:58:00,687
LAURA: Hi.

1969
02:58:00,687 --> 02:58:03,227
MATT: Still hasn't turned around, but seems to be
listening.

1970
02:58:03,227 --> 02:58:16,503
LAURA: Champion of Pelor, the Dawnfather. We've
been speaking to the gods. We're taking on Vecna.

1971
02:58:16,503 --> 02:58:27,450
Hopefully not alone, but we need to speak with
Kord. I know that sounds odd, but Grog was

1972
02:58:27,450 --> 02:58:28,580
hoping--

1973
02:58:28,580 --> 02:58:34,588
LAURA and TRAVIS: I was hoping that you would know
how to contact him directly, perhaps maybe have

1974
02:58:34,588 --> 02:58:40,522
something that was tuned to his plane of
existence, potentially.

1975
02:58:40,522 --> 02:58:59,728
MATT: "You have drawn Kord's attention once,
directly. He is aware of you. Should you wish to

1976
02:58:59,728 --> 02:59:15,088
"speak, that I can teach. It is a long process.
Piety, meditation, and learning of the history of

1977
02:59:15,088 --> 02:59:20,423
"the Storm Lord himself. But it can be done."

1978
02:59:20,423 --> 02:59:23,662
LAURA: How long of a process is this, that we're
talking?

1979
02:59:23,662 --> 02:59:28,213
MATT: "You cannot rush faith."

1980
02:59:28,213 --> 02:59:35,069
LAURA: I'm not trying to rush faith. I'm just
saying that Vecna has ascended to godhood. We have

1981
02:59:35,069 --> 02:59:40,652
a limited amount of time to take him down. We need
to speak with Kord.

1982
02:59:40,652 --> 02:59:46,324
MATT: "I cannot help you."

1983
02:59:46,324 --> 02:59:48,662
LAURA: You can't speak to him directly?

1984
02:59:48,662 --> 02:59:52,377
MATT: "I can meditate and reach out, perhaps."

1985
02:59:52,377 --> 02:59:58,828
LAURA: Maybe draw his attention to us? The need is
dire.

1986
02:59:58,828 --> 03:00:04,018
MATT: "It doesn't work the way you ask. Kord isn't
a giving god."

1987
03:00:04,018 --> 03:00:05,780
LAURA: He's not?

1988
03:00:05,780 --> 03:00:09,513
MATT: Make a religion check.

1989
03:00:09,513 --> 03:00:18,267
LAURA: Okay, yeah, this is going to go so well.
Hold up. 20?

1990
03:00:18,267 --> 03:00:28,384
MATT: Okay. You know about Kord. Kord, from what
you understand, is the god of competition and

1991
03:00:28,384 --> 03:00:44,869
storms and chaotic nature and good-neutral
territory, but emphasizes contest and--

1992
03:00:44,869 --> 03:00:47,355
TRAVIS: Self-reliance.

1993
03:00:47,355 --> 03:00:53,779
MATT: Yeah, he's not the kind of god you can
beseech with a word.

1994
03:00:53,779 --> 03:01:00,904
LAURA: Maybe you can tell him there's a big fight
coming. Call out to him! Get his attention.

1995
03:01:00,904 --> 03:01:03,949
TRAVIS: See if he wants box seats or something?

1996
03:01:03,949 --> 03:01:07,745
LAURA: Yeah! Say he can help take down the big bad
guy.

1997
03:01:07,745 --> 03:01:09,063
TRAVIS: Free food and drinks?

1998
03:01:09,063 --> 03:01:13,137
LAURA: Definitely! Prime tickets to a UFC fight.

1999
03:01:13,137 --> 03:01:19,431
TRAVIS: Do you happen to know, from all your years
of meditation, what plane or where Kord might

2000
03:01:19,431 --> 03:01:20,607
reside?

2001
03:01:20,607 --> 03:01:22,346
MATT: "Ysgard."

2002
03:01:22,346 --> 03:01:25,515
TRAVIS: Ysgard?

2003
03:01:25,515 --> 03:01:26,845
LAURA: East guard?

2004
03:01:26,845 --> 03:01:27,944
MATT: "Ysgard."

2005
03:01:27,944 --> 03:01:28,936
TRAVIS: East guard.

2006
03:01:28,936 --> 03:01:32,320
(laughter)

2007
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:36,462
LAURA: He is god. East guard.

2008
03:01:36,462 --> 03:01:39,774
MATT: Y-S-G-A-R-D.

2009
03:01:39,774 --> 03:01:48,201
(laughter)

2010
03:01:48,201 --> 03:01:55,626
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Ysgard. Hmm. Is that on
another plane?

2011
03:01:55,626 --> 03:01:58,446
LAURA: Is that near the Fields of Elysium, or a
totally different place?

2012
03:01:58,446 --> 03:02:01,891
MATT: "I do not know."

2013
03:02:01,891 --> 03:02:06,030
TRAVIS: Listen, he is very busy right now with his
meditation garden.

2014
03:02:06,030 --> 03:02:12,075
LAURA: Right, yeah. So you have nothing else that
you can do? I know that you're going to fight his

2015
03:02:12,122 --> 03:02:19,129
troops, but the fact of the matter is Vecna is a
god. If we can't find some way to speak to Kord,

2016
03:02:19,129 --> 03:02:22,476
we may not be able to save the world again.

2017
03:02:22,476 --> 03:02:26,043
TRAVIS: Action now would prevent the spread of his
power.

2018
03:02:26,043 --> 03:02:37,981
MATT: "If what you say is true, I'm certain Kord
already knows. We will do what we can, but what

2019
03:02:37,981 --> 03:02:40,985
"you ask is not within our ability to grant."

2020
03:02:40,985 --> 03:02:49,113
TRAVIS: Fair enough. You don't happen to have a
bean on you, do you? Hard no?

2021
03:02:49,113 --> 03:02:52,443
LAURA: Powerful beans. Super.

2022
03:02:52,443 --> 03:02:55,931
MATT: For the first time, you see Kord glance over
his shoulder at you--

2023
03:02:55,931 --> 03:02:59,145
LAURA: (laughs) He hasn't looked at us this whole
fucking time?

2024
03:02:59,145 --> 03:03:09,375
MATT: No, he's been back to you and looking over
the shoulder. He finally turns and gives a nudge

2025
03:03:09,375 --> 03:03:19,483
to one of the monks up top, who darts off.
(running noises) A few awkward quiet minutes pass.

2026
03:03:19,483 --> 03:03:27,623
(running noises) Jumps down into the sand pit,
runs up, and hands you a small satchel.

2027
03:03:27,623 --> 03:03:32,061
TRAVIS: I look inside.

2028
03:03:32,061 --> 03:03:33,716
MATT: It is filled with beans.

2029
03:03:33,716 --> 03:03:38,481
(laughter)

2030
03:03:38,481 --> 03:03:41,052
LAURA: You have everything you've ever wanted,
Grog. Congratulations.

2031
03:03:41,052 --> 03:03:48,558
TRAVIS: Everybody else got <i>one.</i> I've got a
satchel. Just fucking name the group after me. We

2032
03:03:48,558 --> 03:03:50,328
are out. Thank you!

2033
03:03:50,328 --> 03:03:52,806
LAURA: Can I see what he was drawing in the sand
while we were over there?

2034
03:03:52,806 --> 03:03:54,714
MATT: Make a perception check.

2035
03:03:54,714 --> 03:03:59,879
LAURA: 18.

2036
03:03:59,879 --> 03:04:01,736
TRAVIS: I'll do it, too, because I was curious.

2037
03:04:01,736 --> 03:04:03,370
MATT: Go for it.

2038
03:04:03,370 --> 03:04:04,559
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it.

2039
03:04:04,559 --> 03:04:06,573
(laughter)

2040
03:04:06,573 --> 03:04:15,828
MATT: You glance over and you see one sketch that
appears to be a general overview of the city, of

2041
03:04:15,828 --> 03:04:21,941
all the different quarters that make up the
mountain. And he's essentially trying to work out

2042
03:04:21,941 --> 03:04:27,249
defense positions within the city and preparing
for some sort of siege.

2043
03:04:27,249 --> 03:04:34,278
TRAVIS: I thank you for seeing us at this late
hour, and I wish you luck in the defense of this

2044
03:04:34,278 --> 03:04:36,178
temple and this city.

2045
03:04:36,178 --> 03:04:38,099
MATT: "I wish I could be of more help."

2046
03:04:38,099 --> 03:04:39,599
TRAVIS: You have been.

2047
03:04:39,599 --> 03:04:43,949
LAURA: Groon, if Vecna attacks here, he'll bring
undead.

2048
03:04:43,949 --> 03:04:48,440
MATT: "That's all right. We'll bring the storm."

2049
03:04:48,440 --> 03:04:54,144
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! That was a noble answer! I'm
sorry. I'm cool. We're out.

2050
03:04:54,144 --> 03:05:04,285
SAM: If you ever need any antique furniture or
decor, ask for the Meat Man. He get you good deal.

2051
03:05:04,285 --> 03:05:06,221
(clicks tongue)

2052
03:05:06,221 --> 03:05:09,536
MATT: (grunts) He turns back to facing away.

2053
03:05:09,536 --> 03:05:12,043
LAURA: He's really creepy, isn't he?

2054
03:05:12,043 --> 03:05:15,378
TRAVIS: Make sure as we leave, we back away. Back
away.

2055
03:05:15,378 --> 03:05:16,914
LAURA: Back away.

2056
03:05:16,914 --> 03:05:18,686
TALIESIN: What was Kord painting?

2057
03:05:18,686 --> 03:05:20,669
MATT: He was drawing in the sand.

2058
03:05:20,669 --> 03:05:24,653
TALIESIN: Please tell me it was a horse playing
saxophone. That's all I want.

2059
03:05:24,653 --> 03:05:27,869
(laughter)

2060
03:05:27,869 --> 03:05:32,544
MATT: He sits back down in the sand pit and goes
back to his concentration, leaves you to your

2061
03:05:32,544 --> 03:05:33,659
business.

2062
03:05:33,659 --> 03:05:36,064
TRAVIS: That was a total win. I got a bag full of
beans.

2063
03:05:36,064 --> 03:05:37,165
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

2064
03:05:37,165 --> 03:05:39,979
TRAVIS: Yep. And we know that Kord is on
"he's-a-god."

2065
03:05:39,979 --> 03:05:43,103
LAURA: Yeah. He's in Ysgard.

2066
03:05:43,103 --> 03:05:45,288
TRAVIS: You're saying it weird.

2067
03:05:45,288 --> 03:05:47,071
LAURA: "He's-god."

2068
03:05:47,071 --> 03:05:51,059
TRAVIS: "He's-god." So should I change back?

2069
03:05:51,059 --> 03:05:53,109
SAM: I can't do it again.

2070
03:05:53,109 --> 03:05:55,179
TRAVIS: What do you mean? You can't?

2071
03:05:55,179 --> 03:05:58,821
SAM: I guess I could do it one more time, sure.

2072
03:05:58,821 --> 03:06:02,352
TRAVIS: We're going back to sleep, right? It's
either that or I put a fancy robe over my whole

2073
03:06:02,352 --> 03:06:03,205
face.

2074
03:06:03,205 --> 03:06:05,656
SAM: This time, I make us all blue.

2075
03:06:05,656 --> 03:06:09,055
LAURA: Lovely. Can I have light blue hair?

2076
03:06:09,055 --> 03:06:13,145
SAM: Dark blue skin, light blue hair? Sure. I'll
be opposite.

2077
03:06:13,145 --> 03:06:18,746
LIAM: Not painted bald caps? Not blue-painted bald
caps?

2078
03:06:18,746 --> 03:06:22,588
LAURA: No, I want beautiful hair. I've always
wanted blue hair.

2079
03:06:22,588 --> 03:06:25,223
LIAM: That's not the Blue Man Group I know.

2080
03:06:25,223 --> 03:06:31,283
TRAVIS: We make our way back to the temples. Is
the bustle the same outside of the temple?

2081
03:06:31,283 --> 03:06:37,765
MATT: Well, as you step out of the temple and
Scanlan blues you all, you make your way across--

2082
03:06:37,765 --> 03:06:39,656
SAM: Episode title: The Blue Job.

2083
03:06:39,656 --> 03:06:44,986
(laughter)

2084
03:06:44,986 --> 03:06:47,696
TRAVIS: The multiple blue jobs.

2085
03:06:47,696 --> 03:06:54,941
MATT: Yeah. Okay. As you exit the temple, it's
late night, and the bustle has calmed down a

2086
03:06:54,941 --> 03:07:04,057
little bit, as it is the evening, but you do see
there are-- normally what are small patrol lights at

2087
03:07:04,057 --> 03:07:10,426
the edges of the walls, you can see large fires
are burning at the edges to extend eyesight.

2088
03:07:10,554 --> 03:07:25,177
It's interesting. You see wyverns in the sky. You
hear the familiar cries of wyverns, and at first,

2089
03:07:25,177 --> 03:07:33,847
it catches you off-guard. But Vex'ahlia, glancing
up, you can see they all have some sort of barding

2090
03:07:33,847 --> 03:07:36,454
on them. Silver and blue barding.

2091
03:07:36,454 --> 03:07:41,704
LAURA: Oh shit! It's the temple of Bahamut? Yes!

2092
03:07:41,704 --> 03:07:50,545
MATT: Platinum dragons. They have wyvern riders
here that act as air patrol during times of

2093
03:07:50,545 --> 03:07:52,144
intense possible warfare.

2094
03:07:52,144 --> 03:07:59,249
TRAVIS: Air force got scrambled. (aircraft
noises) Amazing!

2095
03:07:59,249 --> 03:08:01,426
TALIESIN: Formation. Smoke.

2096
03:08:01,426 --> 03:08:04,581
LAURA: I really hope Vasselheim stands.

2097
03:08:04,581 --> 03:08:12,471
MATT: You guys make your way back to Raven's
Crest, to the entranceway to Scanlan's Magnificent

2098
03:08:12,471 --> 03:08:16,060
Mansion and to the rest of your party, freshly
washed.

2099
03:08:16,060 --> 03:08:22,580
TRAVIS: So a question: what's on the menu?

2100
03:08:22,580 --> 03:08:24,356
TALIESIN: Beans, apparently.

2101
03:08:24,356 --> 03:08:26,647
TRAVIS: Now, look. How do you even know that?

2102
03:08:26,647 --> 03:08:29,210
TALIESIN: I just assumed because I know you.

2103
03:08:29,210 --> 03:08:34,308
TRAVIS: Why would you only serve beans? There's no
meat or fish?

2104
03:08:34,308 --> 03:08:36,500
SAM: It's vegan here. We serve a lot of beans.

2105
03:08:36,500 --> 03:08:38,093
TRAVIS: Because of your daughter?

2106
03:08:38,093 --> 03:08:39,013
SAM: Yes.

2107
03:08:39,013 --> 03:08:40,966
TRAVIS: Well, she's not here. Can we make an
exception?

2108
03:08:40,966 --> 03:08:43,230
SAM: She's always here in my heart.

2109
03:08:43,230 --> 03:08:46,701
TALIESIN: Hopefully not in the kitchen, though, so
we're going to cook anything we like.

2110
03:08:46,701 --> 03:08:53,744
TRAVIS: I got what we needed. I got myself a
bean.

2111
03:08:53,744 --> 03:08:55,127
MARISHA: You got a shard?

2112
03:08:55,127 --> 03:09:02,399
TRAVIS: I got several shards. I got a bag full of
shards. Hold on, the power might bowl you all

2113
03:09:02,399 --> 03:09:03,788
over.

2114
03:09:03,788 --> 03:09:07,573
TALIESIN: That actually might, especially if not
eaten with rice.

2115
03:09:07,573 --> 03:09:10,788
TRAVIS: What are you doing? (gasping)

2116
03:09:10,788 --> 03:09:13,779
LIAM: It's all right; I can eat anything.

2117
03:09:13,779 --> 03:09:15,180
TRAVIS: How do you feel?

2118
03:09:15,180 --> 03:09:16,327
MATT: Tastes like ash.

2119
03:09:16,327 --> 03:09:18,230
LIAM: Yeah, so does everything.

2120
03:09:18,230 --> 03:09:22,027
MARISHA: (gasps) We used to eat these in the Fire
Ashari all the time. These are a rare delicacy!

2121
03:09:22,027 --> 03:09:32,423
Good find, Grog. (gasps) I could grow some more.
Oh my god. We can have coal bean soup all the time

2122
03:09:32,423 --> 03:09:35,910
at home, you guys. These are coal beans. They're
great.

2123
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:39,436
TRAVIS: These are not the same thing?

2124
03:09:39,436 --> 03:09:43,282
LAURA: There could be an actual seed of power
within there.

2125
03:09:43,282 --> 03:09:44,983
TRAVIS: Is there a table nearby?

2126
03:09:44,983 --> 03:09:47,103
MATT: Yeah, you're not too far from the--

2127
03:09:47,103 --> 03:09:51,290
TRAVIS: I dump all the beans out on the table. Are
there any beans that look different from the

2128
03:09:51,290 --> 03:09:52,056
rest?

2129
03:09:52,056 --> 03:09:53,459
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2130
03:09:53,459 --> 03:09:58,351
LAURA: I'll look over his shoulder and help look.
I'm going to help look.

2131
03:09:58,351 --> 03:10:00,020
TRAVIS: (laughing) 16. Does that count?

2132
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:01,256
LAURA: That's not bad.

2133
03:10:01,256 --> 03:10:07,370
MATT: You actually find four beans that look a bit
darker, but squishier. They look to maybe be a

2134
03:10:07,370 --> 03:10:11,323
little on the the rotten side.

2135
03:10:11,323 --> 03:10:17,029
TRAVIS: These are the beans. I mean, I should've
thought-- Kord is a fist, and you put one of each

2136
03:10:17,029 --> 03:10:20,617
four on the knuckles. I squish each one of the
beans.

2137
03:10:20,617 --> 03:10:24,905
MATT: And they squish easy. (squishing noise)

2138
03:10:24,905 --> 03:10:34,842
TRAVIS: I'm not a praying man. Bless my gauntlet.
Anything happen?

2139
03:10:34,842 --> 03:10:38,786
MARISHA: There's a little juice running down your
gauntlet.

2140
03:10:38,786 --> 03:10:40,387
TRAVIS: Are they glowing?

2141
03:10:40,387 --> 03:10:42,025
LAURA: Well...

2142
03:10:42,025 --> 03:10:45,192
MARISHA: Fermented? Fermented.

2143
03:10:45,192 --> 03:10:47,270
MATT: A little funky.

2144
03:10:47,270 --> 03:10:54,449
TRAVIS: You know what? I bet if I pray hard
enough, they will disappear. Look above you!

2145
03:10:54,449 --> 03:10:56,795
LAURA and SAM: (noises of surprise)

2146
03:10:56,795 --> 03:10:59,700
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

2147
03:10:59,700 --> 03:11:04,633
TRAVIS: Hey! That's not terrible. (laughing) I got
plus two! 18!

2148
03:11:04,633 --> 03:11:08,572
(laughter)

2149
03:11:08,572 --> 03:11:12,359
MATT: Strangely, Scanlan and Pike are impressed.

2150
03:11:12,359 --> 03:11:17,231
SAM: I just rolled a two. Whoa. That was
impressive.

2151
03:11:17,231 --> 03:11:21,116
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, the line between me and Kord.
Super tight.

2152
03:11:21,116 --> 03:11:24,625
MARISHA: Keyleth goes behind Grog and starts
cleaning up the beans that he just threw.

2153
03:11:24,625 --> 03:11:26,852
TRAVIS: Pike! Pretty good, right?

2154
03:11:26,852 --> 03:11:29,905
MATT: "Honestly? Kind of blown away."

2155
03:11:29,905 --> 03:11:33,787
TRAVIS: I know. Maybe I should get a tattoo for
Kord, like the symbols you have for Sarenrae.

2156
03:11:33,787 --> 03:11:35,820
MATT: "What're you thinking for the tattoo?"

2157
03:11:35,820 --> 03:11:39,297
TRAVIS: I don't know. A fist?

2158
03:11:39,297 --> 03:11:40,447
TALIESIN: Or a bean.

2159
03:11:40,447 --> 03:11:44,166
TRAVIS: Hey, don't put ideas in my head. A bean?

2160
03:11:44,166 --> 03:11:49,685
MATT: "Actually, the symbol of the Storm Lord's
cool. I'll get it up for you." And she pulls out a

2161
03:11:49,685 --> 03:11:55,475
piece of paper and sketches it up for you. It's
this cool disc, this dark metal disc with blue

2162
03:11:55,475 --> 03:11:58,260
bolts of lightning that stick out of the center.

2163
03:11:58,260 --> 03:12:02,882
TRAVIS: The Storm Lord symbol is the jam. That is
a cartoon bean.

2164
03:12:02,882 --> 03:12:04,483
LAURA: It's a bean with a dick.

2165
03:12:04,483 --> 03:12:14,048
TRAVIS: The dick is smaller than the balls. It's
like a parrot's beak. Listen. We're going to stick

2166
03:12:14,048 --> 03:12:16,243
with the Storm Lord sigil.

2167
03:12:16,243 --> 03:12:19,146
LIAM: We are going to save the world.

2168
03:12:19,146 --> 03:12:27,139
TRAVIS: Well, listen, I found out where Kord is.
He's in a place called--

2169
03:12:27,139 --> 03:12:30,639
LAURA and SAM: Ysgard.

2170
03:12:30,639 --> 03:12:32,239
MARISHA: Sure.

2171
03:12:32,239 --> 03:12:34,845
TRAVIS: Are you familiar?

2172
03:12:34,845 --> 03:12:35,803
MARISHA: No.

2173
03:12:35,803 --> 03:12:37,400
TRAVIS: Oh. Why'd you say sure?

2174
03:12:37,400 --> 03:12:39,150
MARISHA: I was just seeming intelligent.

2175
03:12:39,150 --> 03:12:42,833
TRAVIS: I do that all the time. Anybody have any
idea where that is?

2176
03:12:42,833 --> 03:12:44,251
SAM: No. We can ask.

2177
03:12:44,251 --> 03:12:45,767
TRAVIS: Okay. Who can we ask?

2178
03:12:45,767 --> 03:12:47,415
TALIESIN: Asking the dungeon master.

2179
03:12:47,415 --> 03:12:51,280
MATT: (chuckles) Make a religion check, only if
you're trained in it.

2180
03:12:51,280 --> 03:12:53,695
LIAM: I'm making a religion check. Jeepers.

2181
03:12:53,695 --> 03:12:55,273
MATT: I just rolled for Pike.

2182
03:12:55,273 --> 03:12:59,178
TRAVIS: 17, but I'm not trained in it.

2183
03:12:59,178 --> 03:13:03,009
LIAM: Just a 12.

2184
03:13:03,009 --> 03:13:05,370
TALIESIN: I'm not trained in religion.

2185
03:13:05,370 --> 03:13:09,073
MATT: (sighs) Not a whole lot of information
gleaned on this.

2186
03:13:09,073 --> 03:13:14,291
TRAVIS: (sighs) Okay. How did Pike roll?

2187
03:13:14,291 --> 03:13:16,275
MATT: Pike didn't roll that great.

2188
03:13:16,275 --> 03:13:17,591
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2189
03:13:17,591 --> 03:13:24,095
LAURA: Percy? With your migraine, do you know what
else we need to make these trammels?

2190
03:13:24,095 --> 03:13:28,438
TALIESIN: I've been thinking a lot. I've been
trying to skirt around this information for a

2191
03:13:28,438 --> 03:13:31,919
bunch of reasons, so I've been making a mental
shopping list.

2192
03:13:31,919 --> 03:13:37,144
MATT: Yeah. And from what you recall, it seems
that one, the tools that were used to build them

2193
03:13:37,144 --> 03:13:53,892
are generally with the anvil forge. It's more the
essence of the god that drives the trammel. The

2194
03:13:53,892 --> 03:13:56,317
material required is pure platinum.

2195
03:13:56,317 --> 03:13:58,177
LAURA: (gasps) Platinum mines!

2196
03:13:58,177 --> 03:14:00,183
TRAVIS: Yeah, that we buried under a mountain.

2197
03:14:00,183 --> 03:14:01,761
LAURA: So? We know where they are.

2198
03:14:01,761 --> 03:14:06,706
MARISHA: Do we for sure need platinum?

2199
03:14:06,706 --> 03:14:13,494
MATT: The trammels are about that long. They're
giant stakes of platinum.

2200
03:14:13,494 --> 03:14:15,561
LAURA: We need more platinum.

2201
03:14:15,561 --> 03:14:20,380
TALIESIN: I'm attempting to do the math of how
much platinum...

2202
03:14:20,380 --> 03:14:29,154
MATT: I mean, if you were to melt down platinum
pieces? Each trammel would probably be close to

2203
03:14:29,154 --> 03:14:36,141
I'd say-- with the density and the thickness of
it-- 500 platinum.

2204
03:14:36,141 --> 03:14:39,080
MARISHA: Each trammel is 500 platinum?

2205
03:14:39,080 --> 03:14:43,669
MATT: Yeah. For the thickness of it, for the pure
platinum structure.

2206
03:14:43,669 --> 03:14:45,811
MARISHA: How much do we have?

2207
03:14:45,811 --> 03:14:53,310
LAURA: Well, I didn't write exactly how much
platinum we have. I transposed the platinum into

2208
03:14:53,310 --> 03:14:55,029
gold in my notes.

2209
03:14:55,029 --> 03:14:56,329
MATT: Okay.

2210
03:14:56,329 --> 03:15:01,530
TALIESIN: We can buy platinum. Go to a bank and
exchange it.

2211
03:15:01,530 --> 03:15:03,621
MATT: You can exchange gold for platinum.

2212
03:15:03,621 --> 03:15:10,190
MARISHA: Wait, Grog. You had it in your original
Bag of Holding? How much was written down on our

2213
03:15:10,190 --> 03:15:11,513
original Bag of Holding list?

2214
03:15:11,513 --> 03:15:13,608
TRAVIS: I don't know. There were a bunch of
digits.

2215
03:15:13,608 --> 03:15:18,379
MARISHA: Do you not still have it written down?

2216
03:15:18,379 --> 03:15:25,184
TALIESIN: If he actually has the phrase "a bunch
of digits," that would make me so happy right

2217
03:15:25,184 --> 03:15:26,437
now.

2218
03:15:26,437 --> 03:15:31,365
TRAVIS: You know, we could always take Kima's
greatsword. It's made out of solid platinum.

2219
03:15:31,365 --> 03:15:37,697
MATT: She has that sword right now.

2220
03:15:37,697 --> 03:15:40,898
TRAVIS: Yeah, she does. I'm just saying.

2221
03:15:40,898 --> 03:15:45,085
SAM: Who was the other band of travelers who
fought and lost?

2222
03:15:45,085 --> 03:15:46,840
TRAVIS: 1,600 platinum.

2223
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:48,636
MARISHA: We had 1,600 platinum, originally.

2224
03:15:48,636 --> 03:15:53,801
TRAVIS: 1,619.

2225
03:15:53,801 --> 03:15:57,141
TALIESIN: There's part of me that doesn't want to
know.

2226
03:15:57,141 --> 03:15:59,972
MARISHA: We're going to find out.

2227
03:15:59,972 --> 03:16:05,624
LAURA: We could go to the bank here in Vasselheim
and switch out money for platinum. We have enough

2228
03:16:05,624 --> 03:16:08,584
gold to do. It's 500 platinum each, you said?

2229
03:16:08,584 --> 03:16:14,224
MARISHA: Is there a place where we could buy
bars?

2230
03:16:14,224 --> 03:16:20,330
LAURA: 5,000 gold would be 500 platinum? Okay.

2231
03:16:20,330 --> 03:16:24,173
MATT: You have to melt it down to get rid of the
impurities to get the metal down to its purest

2232
03:16:24,173 --> 03:16:28,835
form. There's a process to it that you are
actually familiar with.

2233
03:16:28,835 --> 03:16:34,514
TRAVIS: I'm familiar with it, all of a sudden. So
because we have these shards, right, these magical

2234
03:16:34,514 --> 03:16:40,876
beans, if we lose, do we effectively kill all the
gods whose shards we have?

2235
03:16:40,876 --> 03:16:45,212
TALIESIN: We depower them, so they'll be weak when
they go against Vecna.

2236
03:16:45,212 --> 03:16:48,474
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a lot of responsibility I was
not aware of.

2237
03:16:48,474 --> 03:16:57,519
LAURA: Well, we need to not lose. They're still
diminished if we do defeat Vecna. That part of

2238
03:16:57,519 --> 03:16:59,971
them is forever chaining him.

2239
03:16:59,971 --> 03:17:04,648
MARISHA: If we fail, he could be coming after
them. They have no line of defense.

2240
03:17:04,648 --> 03:17:08,236
TRAVIS: Worst scenario possible. Cool. Good to
know.

2241
03:17:08,236 --> 03:17:13,239
MATT: Good news is, you do know that the Divine
Gate works both ways. He could not travel into

2242
03:17:13,239 --> 03:17:17,667
their realms. They could not travel into that.
However, it prevents them from intervening

2243
03:17:17,667 --> 03:17:20,977
directly on his dominion over the Prime Material
Plane.

2244
03:17:20,977 --> 03:17:24,857
LIAM: And as far as we know, this other group did
not have the help of gods.

2245
03:17:24,857 --> 03:17:27,498
LAURA: Right. As far as we know.

2246
03:17:27,498 --> 03:17:30,799
LIAM: As far as we know, unless they went to all
of the other gods we have not met.

2247
03:17:30,799 --> 03:17:36,899
TALIESIN: It's not like we can't look in on anyone
that we need to really quickly. I'm feeling the

2248
03:17:36,899 --> 03:17:37,911
urge.

2249
03:17:37,911 --> 03:17:39,650
LAURA: Do you know who it could be?

2250
03:17:39,650 --> 03:17:45,328
LIAM: We might want to check and see if Allura,
Gilmore, Kima, all our buddies are okay. Kash,

2251
03:17:45,328 --> 03:17:46,460
Zahra.

2252
03:17:46,460 --> 03:17:49,916
TALIESIN: My question is, does it matter, at the
moment?

2253
03:17:49,916 --> 03:17:52,231
LAURA: Of course it matters, dear.

2254
03:17:52,231 --> 03:17:56,450
TALIESIN: Does it? Does it just make us panic?

2255
03:17:56,450 --> 03:18:02,443
LAURA: At least we'd know if he raised them up
like he said he did, if we'll be fighting undead

2256
03:18:02,443 --> 03:18:04,417
Gilmore and undead Allura.

2257
03:18:04,417 --> 03:18:16,068
TALIESIN: All right, point made. Point very well
made. Let's start with--

2258
03:18:16,068 --> 03:18:21,309
MARISHA: I have a few scrys that I want to do,
anyway.

2259
03:18:21,309 --> 03:18:22,660
LAURA: Can we scry through this dimension?

2260
03:18:22,660 --> 03:18:24,242
MARISHA: Nope. I've got to pop out.

2261
03:18:24,242 --> 03:18:28,722
TRAVIS: Shouldn't you rest first?

2262
03:18:28,722 --> 03:18:30,841
TALIESIN: No, finish this first.

2263
03:18:30,841 --> 03:18:35,901
LIAM: What do you need?

2264
03:18:35,901 --> 03:18:42,613
MARISHA: I'm just wondering if I do any type of
large magic, if it'll alert him. Hey, what

2265
03:18:42,613 --> 03:18:47,563
happened to that skull that we got in Brimscythe's
basement?

2266
03:18:47,563 --> 03:18:49,311
TALIESIN: With the gem.

2267
03:18:49,311 --> 03:18:50,837
MARISHA: The gem in the eye.

2268
03:18:50,837 --> 03:18:53,117
LAURA: Funny you should ask.

2269
03:18:53,117 --> 03:18:55,614
MARISHA: Remember, we thought it might be
connected?

2270
03:18:55,614 --> 03:18:59,893
TALIESIN: It had a gem in one eye, if I recall.

2271
03:18:59,893 --> 03:19:03,157
TRAVIS: Yeah, a green emerald gem in one socket,
you dicks.

2272
03:19:03,157 --> 03:19:04,976
SAM: Where is it?

2273
03:19:04,976 --> 03:19:06,978
LAURA: Allura has it.

2274
03:19:06,978 --> 03:19:09,312
MARISHA: We gave it to Allura.

2275
03:19:09,312 --> 03:19:10,388
TRAVIS: What?

2276
03:19:10,388 --> 03:19:12,414
LAURA: Allura has it.

2277
03:19:12,414 --> 03:19:14,308
TRAVIS: No, it's in Percy's workshop.

2278
03:19:14,308 --> 03:19:21,521
LAURA: Sure, and Allura came down and saw it-- no,
I gave it to Allura.

2279
03:19:21,521 --> 03:19:25,670
MARISHA: I wonder if it's spying on everything?

2280
03:19:25,670 --> 03:19:37,032
LAURA: I'm sorry, Grog. I gave you your deck of
cards back! The skull was very dangerous, and at

2281
03:19:37,032 --> 03:19:44,581
the time it seemed like the right thing to do. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry! Look, we just went and got a

2282
03:19:44,581 --> 03:19:46,059
bunch of beans for you.

2283
03:19:46,059 --> 03:19:47,378
TRAVIS: That's true.

2284
03:19:47,378 --> 03:19:50,524
LIAM: And also, buddy, we might be dead in a week,
you don't want to hold on to that kind of shit.

2285
03:19:50,524 --> 03:19:54,624
TALIESIN: We may be going to get the skull back.

2286
03:19:54,624 --> 03:19:58,959
MARISHA: Well, yeah, we could get the skull back
because I was just going through my notes, my old

2287
03:19:58,959 --> 03:20:01,615
diary, of everything that we've been through--

2288
03:20:01,615 --> 03:20:04,080
TALIESIN: It literally has a leaf on it, oh my god.

2289
03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:08,252
MARISHA: I have four diaries of everything we've
been through.

2290
03:20:08,252 --> 03:20:09,604
TALIESIN: I've read them.

2291
03:20:09,604 --> 03:20:12,270
SAM: Ugh. What kind of dumb character keeps a
diary?

2292
03:20:12,270 --> 03:20:19,639
MARISHA: It said evil skull in Brimscythe's--
1/21. We found an evil skull in Brimscythe's

2293
03:20:19,639 --> 03:20:24,916
house. It may be connected to Craven Edge. And I
put stars next to it.

2294
03:20:24,916 --> 03:20:29,852
TALIESIN: Did you put stars next to it because it
was important or did you just put stars next to it?

2295
03:20:29,852 --> 03:20:33,837
MARISHA: I don't know, that's just what I wrote
down a year and a half ago.

2296
03:20:33,837 --> 03:20:39,006
TRAVIS: I mean, do you need me to drop my
scholastic knowledge on this shit? Because I will.

2297
03:20:39,006 --> 03:20:44,214
It talked to me and it was like, "If you free me,
I'll give you a wish."

2298
03:20:44,214 --> 03:20:45,268
MARISHA: The skull?

2299
03:20:45,268 --> 03:20:48,614
TRAVIS: Yeah. Why do you think I was trying to
break that shit?

2300
03:20:48,614 --> 03:20:50,988
LAURA: I don't believe if you'd freed it you
would've gotten a wish, I think you would've

2301
03:20:50,988 --> 03:20:52,034
fought something.

2302
03:20:52,034 --> 03:20:52,995
TRAVIS: Do you know for sure?

2303
03:20:52,995 --> 03:20:53,767
LAURA: No.

2304
03:20:53,767 --> 03:20:55,305
TRAVIS: Then what are we talking about?

2305
03:20:55,305 --> 03:21:01,262
TALIESIN: Let's find out what's going on with the
skull.

2306
03:21:01,262 --> 03:21:03,600
LIAM: Yeah, we are in final days, here.

2307
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:05,476
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's give ourselves--

2308
03:21:05,476 --> 03:21:06,501
SAM: What are we doing?

2309
03:21:06,501 --> 03:21:11,384
TALIESIN: We're going to try and take 48 hours to
get as much done as humanly possible.

2310
03:21:11,384 --> 03:21:19,056
LAURA: We need to scry on the fucking friends, we
need to check in on that skull, maybe.

2311
03:21:19,056 --> 03:21:23,976
And you need to maybe open up the plane to the
Dread Emperor and see about the Craven Edge.

2312
03:21:23,976 --> 03:21:26,014
MARISHA: What now?

2313
03:21:26,014 --> 03:21:27,865
LIAM: The gods must be crazy.

2314
03:21:27,865 --> 03:21:29,300
TALIESIN: Part two?

2315
03:21:29,300 --> 03:21:30,992
SAM: That's low priority.

2316
03:21:30,992 --> 03:21:32,068
LAURA: Is it?

2317
03:21:32,068 --> 03:21:33,735
SAM: I don't think that's the thing.

2318
03:21:33,735 --> 03:21:36,292
LAURA: What if that weapon is super good against
Vecna?

2319
03:21:36,292 --> 03:21:37,719
SAM: Just because it's a sword?

2320
03:21:37,719 --> 03:21:44,691
MARISHA: Okay, wait, did she say we needed the
sword? Also, I think the knight guy that you

2321
03:21:44,691 --> 03:21:50,866
fought that was super awful was the bloody--

2322
03:21:50,866 --> 03:21:51,795
LIAM: Kas.

2323
03:21:51,795 --> 03:21:56,534
LAURA: No, Kas is destroyed. He turned to ash. He
fought Vecna and was turned to ash.

2324
03:21:56,534 --> 03:21:58,472
SAM: Did the knight have a sword?

2325
03:21:58,472 --> 03:22:01,194
TRAVIS: He did. A giant blade that emitted
shadow.

2326
03:22:01,194 --> 03:22:03,556
SAM: Maybe that was the sword.

2327
03:22:03,556 --> 03:22:10,870
MARISHA: But wasn't he brought back? Kas the
Bloody-Handed, right? Oh wait, he fought--

2328
03:22:10,870 --> 03:22:14,773
LAURA: He fought against Vecna! They destroyed
each other. It's the reason Vecna was destroyed to

2329
03:22:14,773 --> 03:22:15,701
begin with.

2330
03:22:15,701 --> 03:22:18,021
MARISHA: But maybe he brought Kas back and that
was the Death Knight we fought.

2331
03:22:18,021 --> 03:22:20,246
SAM: The world is full of mysteries.

2332
03:22:20,246 --> 03:22:23,790
TALIESIN: One of which is whether or not our
friends are alive.

2333
03:22:23,790 --> 03:22:27,899
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to step outside and
scry on Allura first!

2334
03:22:27,899 --> 03:22:35,836
LIAM: And I'm going to-- nothing, I'm just going
to stand and walk out front.

2335
03:22:35,836 --> 03:22:39,702
MATT: So. You're scrying first.

2336
03:22:39,702 --> 03:22:41,329
MARISHA: Allura.

2337
03:22:41,329 --> 03:22:45,491
MATT: Okay. So you step out into the center of the
structure--

2338
03:22:45,491 --> 03:22:47,804
LAURA: (whispering) Please please please please
please...

2339
03:22:47,804 --> 03:22:51,503
MARISHA: Wait! Is anybody around? Nothing's weird
and out of the ordinary?

2340
03:22:51,503 --> 03:22:54,069
MATT: You're in the Raven's Crest.

2341
03:22:54,069 --> 03:23:00,480
MARISHA: Okay. Just want to make sure. People just
punk'd us at Sprigg's cabin!

2342
03:23:00,480 --> 03:23:03,460
SAM: We're inside a church.

2343
03:23:03,460 --> 03:23:05,990
MARISHA: Doesn't mean assassins can't get inside a
church.

2344
03:23:05,990 --> 03:23:07,296
LAURA: Just go, just scry!

2345
03:23:07,296 --> 03:23:08,373
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going!

2346
03:23:08,373 --> 03:23:17,406
MATT: Okay. So. (laughs) As you sit and focus,
concentrate, you draw out the various arcane

2347
03:23:17,406 --> 03:23:24,373
glyphs on the ground and focus on Allura. Your
vision expands into the sky, (whoosh) rushing

2348
03:23:24,373 --> 03:23:32,086
through the night air and the spattering of clouds
that have amassed over Vasselheim. It fires

2349
03:23:32,086 --> 03:23:43,559
through the stratosphere, dives down into the
center of Emon, into a bedroom. She is currently

2350
03:23:43,559 --> 03:23:52,620
at a desk and is feverishly writing on parchment.
Her hair is tousled a bit and she has a thick robe

2351
03:23:52,620 --> 03:24:00,089
over her shoulders, and you can see she finishes
writing something, rolls it up, seals it, sets it

2352
03:24:00,089 --> 03:24:07,574
into a pile, thinks a second, casts a spell
absentmindedly, it flickers off and vanishes. She

2353
03:24:07,574 --> 03:24:12,630
goes back to writing. The door opens and you watch
as Kima comes in, brings a little tray with some

2354
03:24:12,630 --> 03:24:18,213
hot tea and sets it down beside her, rubs her
shoulder a bit, and Allura looks back at her and

2355
03:24:18,213 --> 03:24:22,515
nods. You guys are the worst.

2356
03:24:22,515 --> 03:24:25,903
(laughter)

2357
03:24:25,903 --> 03:24:30,392
MATT: Allura puts her face in her hands for a
second rubs her temples, She looks tired. Kima

2358
03:24:30,392 --> 03:24:35,566
leaves the room, and Allura is left there to 
think for a second, looks out the window of her

2359
03:24:35,566 --> 03:24:39,659
tower, then goes back to her writing.

2360
03:24:39,659 --> 03:24:42,524
MARISHA: Okay.

2361
03:24:42,524 --> 03:24:44,873
SAM: Was she covered with blood?

2362
03:24:44,873 --> 03:24:52,160
MARISHA: No, she's fine. She's safe in Emon. So is
Kima. They're both safe.

2363
03:24:52,160 --> 03:24:57,670
SAM: Skull was next on the list?

2364
03:24:57,670 --> 03:25:02,958
LAURA: Well, Allura has the skull. Do we have any
way to talk to her?

2365
03:25:02,958 --> 03:25:04,754
SAM: No.

2366
03:25:04,754 --> 03:25:15,244
MARISHA: Okay. Should I do Gilmore next? Is that
necessary?

2367
03:25:15,244 --> 03:25:18,031
LAURA: Can you scry on the object? No...

2368
03:25:18,031 --> 03:25:20,083
MARISHA: I can scry on an object, right?

2369
03:25:20,083 --> 03:25:21,392
MATT: An object or a person.

2370
03:25:21,392 --> 03:25:23,952
MARISHA: Should I do the skull?

2371
03:25:23,952 --> 03:25:29,952
LIAM: Is it a safe assumption that skull is with
her? She's pretty fucking badass.

2372
03:25:29,952 --> 03:25:33,920
MARISHA: I mean it might just be a lich phylactery
or something.

2373
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:37,327
SAM: Who else would have gone into battle against
Vecna?

2374
03:25:37,327 --> 03:25:43,671
LIAM: Well, if it is a lich phylactery, that
would be something we would smash to bits.

2375
03:25:43,671 --> 03:25:46,574
SAM: Could've been Kash.

2376
03:25:46,574 --> 03:25:48,302
TALIESIN: Could've been Tary.

2377
03:25:48,302 --> 03:25:52,338
SAM: Who? Oh that fancy fellow.

2378
03:25:52,338 --> 03:25:56,763
LAURA: Oh my god, can you scry on Tary? What if he
came searching for us?

2379
03:25:56,763 --> 03:25:58,327
MARISHA: But Tary was still in--

2380
03:25:58,327 --> 03:26:03,533
TALIESIN: Just pick a city. Let's just keep
looking at people in various cities.

2381
03:26:03,533 --> 03:26:08,555
MARISHA: Tary... we would feel it.

2382
03:26:08,555 --> 03:26:17,210
LIAM: Keyleth just spit out an idea. If that
skull, which looked like his fucking head. We've

2383
03:26:17,210 --> 03:26:25,073
dealt with a lich before. If it has even a chance
of being a vessel for his life force, even a

2384
03:26:25,073 --> 03:26:30,580
chance, wouldn't we want to not use it, but
destroy it?

2385
03:26:30,580 --> 03:26:37,858
MATT: I will impart the information that you did
discover that the skull was the skull of a

2386
03:26:37,858 --> 03:26:38,882
githyanki.

2387
03:26:38,882 --> 03:26:42,333
LIAM: Oh, that was from 300 hours ago! I
misspoke.

2388
03:26:42,333 --> 03:26:51,459
MATT: They're a type of people, a race of people
that traverse the Astral Sea.

2389
03:26:51,459 --> 03:26:52,814
LIAM: But it has one eye.

2390
03:26:52,814 --> 03:26:54,264
MATT: Oh, it has two eyes.

2391
03:26:54,264 --> 03:26:56,927
LIAM: Emerald in one eye.

2392
03:26:56,927 --> 03:27:02,307
MATT: Yeah, well, the skull shape was alien and
was elongated, almost elven.

2393
03:27:02,307 --> 03:27:04,457
LIAM: That was hundreds of hours ago.

2394
03:27:04,457 --> 03:27:07,895
MATT: I wanted to save you circularly arguing
about something without some information.

2395
03:27:07,895 --> 03:27:10,406
SAM: Oh, we'll still circularly argue about
something.

2396
03:27:10,406 --> 03:27:11,897
MATT: Oh, I'm sure you will!

2397
03:27:11,897 --> 03:27:13,666
LIAM: Yeah, this clusterfuck's not over.

2398
03:27:13,666 --> 03:27:17,682
SAM: It's been a half-hour of fuckery right here.

2399
03:27:17,813 --> 03:27:20,332
TALIESIN: A little bit of hemming, a little bit of
hawing.

2400
03:27:20,332 --> 03:27:27,647
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. Aren't we forgetting about
one undead thing? Didn't we want to go back and

2401
03:27:27,647 --> 03:27:30,144
talk to Delilah's body?

2402
03:27:30,144 --> 03:27:32,586
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we're going to have that
conversation.

2403
03:27:32,586 --> 03:27:34,020
LIAM: Is she in your bag?

2404
03:27:34,020 --> 03:27:35,303
TALIESIN: That's right.

2405
03:27:35,303 --> 03:27:36,922
MARISHA: She's in the Bag of Colding.

2406
03:27:36,922 --> 03:27:41,776
LAURA: She might be in the Colding. Let's get into
the mansion and talk to her.

2407
03:27:41,776 --> 03:27:44,020
MATT: She's in the Bag of Holding.

2408
03:27:44,054 --> 03:27:46,805
LAURA: Let's go in the mansion first.

2409
03:27:46,805 --> 03:27:50,288
TRAVIS: Are we not in the mansion right now?

2410
03:27:50,288 --> 03:27:51,682
SAM: We stepped out for a second.

2411
03:27:51,682 --> 03:27:52,826
TRAVIS: I never left.

2412
03:27:52,826 --> 03:27:55,532
LAURA: The door's open. We're talking through the
door.

2413
03:27:55,532 --> 03:27:58,692
MARISHA: Yeah, real quick, I still also want to
scry on the Shorecomb.

2414
03:27:58,692 --> 03:28:02,689
TALIESIN: We're going to set her up so that she's
nice and--

2415
03:28:02,689 --> 03:28:04,274
MARISHA: You guys get her set up.

2416
03:28:04,274 --> 03:28:06,357
TALIESIN: In a chair and we're going to bind her.

2417
03:28:06,357 --> 03:28:12,176
MATT: (laughing) You guys pull the corpse of
Delilah Briarwood out of the bag. It hasn't been

2418
03:28:12,176 --> 03:28:19,695
that long. The body's stiff. A lot of the head is
missing. Rigor mortis has definitely caused the

2419
03:28:19,695 --> 03:28:21,300
body to tighten up a bit.

2420
03:28:21,300 --> 03:28:24,442
TRAVIS: Undead gas.

2421
03:28:24,442 --> 03:28:34,631
MATT: I mean, limp. The muscles went lax. Okay, so
as you guys were propping this up, you complete

2422
03:28:34,631 --> 03:28:40,321
your scrying on Shorecomb, and what you do is you
get a vision of the central area of the city,

2423
03:28:40,321 --> 03:28:47,324
right near the cliffside. There's these sheer
cliffs that drop off for maybe a couple hundred feet

2424
03:28:47,324 --> 03:28:54,652
and lead down to the gravelly, rocky beach; dark
rocks, pebbles, they go out about 30 feet until

2425
03:28:54,652 --> 03:29:00,133
they hit the water, and that's where they have
these wooden steps that wind down the side of the

2426
03:29:00,133 --> 03:29:07,240
cliff that lead to the docks, and they have
winches and cranes that lift heavy objects to and

2427
03:29:07,240 --> 03:29:15,281
from the docks to get actually into the city. You
do see a lot of the trees are very thin, but

2428
03:29:15,281 --> 03:29:24,155
within the actual city proper, you see a handful
of larger trees that at this time, because it's

2429
03:29:24,155 --> 03:29:33,043
pushing into the end of winter, beginning of
spring, a lot of them are leafless, but possible

2430
03:29:33,043 --> 03:29:41,039
to use your Transport via Plants with. All right,
you've propped up your corpse, you've bound it.

2431
03:29:41,039 --> 03:29:47,430
Pike is, (uncomfortable noise) "Okay..."

2432
03:29:47,430 --> 03:29:49,925
TRAVIS: We're right behind you; it's fine.

2433
03:29:49,925 --> 03:29:51,668
LIAM: It's a good cause, Pickle.

2434
03:29:51,668 --> 03:29:54,553
MATT: "Do we have our questions? Do we know what
we're going to ask?"

2435
03:29:54,553 --> 03:29:55,872
TRAVIS: How many do we get, five?

2436
03:29:55,872 --> 03:29:57,384
LIAM: Five questions.

2437
03:29:57,384 --> 03:29:58,433
SAM: Three? Five?

2438
03:29:58,433 --> 03:29:59,593
LIAM and TALIESIN: Five.

2439
03:29:59,593 --> 03:30:00,872
MATT: I'm going to double check.

2440
03:30:00,872 --> 03:30:02,070
LIAM: 17.

2441
03:30:02,070 --> 03:30:03,971
TALIESIN: Was Craven Edge the sword?

2442
03:30:03,971 --> 03:30:05,393
LAURA: Oh, that's a good one.

2443
03:30:05,393 --> 03:30:07,493
MARISHA: The sword of Kas.

2444
03:30:07,493 --> 03:30:09,139
LAURA: Solid question.

2445
03:30:09,139 --> 03:30:14,209
LIAM: We could ask about Vecna and her buddy that
banished Grog.

2446
03:30:14,209 --> 03:30:16,162
LAURA: The Shadow Knight.

2447
03:30:16,162 --> 03:30:20,682
TRAVIS: I'm writing them down in my mind.

2448
03:30:20,682 --> 03:30:28,339
TALIESIN: What he has done to prepare for the
inevitable attempts to re-bind him.

2449
03:30:28,339 --> 03:30:33,469
MARISHA: Does he have any weaknesses? Is that too
broad?

2450
03:30:33,469 --> 03:30:35,518
LAURA: Does she have to answer? Do they have to
answer?

2451
03:30:35,518 --> 03:30:36,559
MATT: No.

2452
03:30:36,559 --> 03:30:40,297
MARISHA: But she might not care, right?

2453
03:30:40,297 --> 03:30:46,994
TALIESIN: I don't know, we've got a few things we
can threaten her with. We can attempt to have her

2454
03:30:46,994 --> 03:30:52,334
consecrated and buried in the Raven Queen's temple
so that nothing will ever bring her back again.

2455
03:30:52,334 --> 03:30:54,347
TRAVIS: One more question.

2456
03:30:54,347 --> 03:31:00,755
TALIESIN: Also, in theory, I think it's possible
that I could just send her to hell.

2457
03:31:00,755 --> 03:31:08,312
TRAVIS: Do we want to ask where he is? Where he
was going? What his plan is after ascending?

2458
03:31:08,312 --> 03:31:13,247
LIAM: Percy, buddy. You are a married man.

2459
03:31:13,247 --> 03:31:17,320
TRAVIS: Where he is or where he's planning to
attack first or what his display of power is going

2460
03:31:17,320 --> 03:31:18,319
to be?

2461
03:31:18,319 --> 03:31:25,268
MARISHA: Oh sure, because he has to do a display
to get followers.

2462
03:31:25,268 --> 03:31:33,285
TRAVIS: So we have sword of Kas, bloody knight,
what he's trying to do to prevent his binding,

2463
03:31:33,285 --> 03:31:35,534
weakness/fears, and display of power.

2464
03:31:35,534 --> 03:31:42,143
MARISHA: Unless the knight was Sylas. I don't
know, I guess we'll find out.

2465
03:31:42,143 --> 03:31:44,600
TRAVIS: You good with those five?

2466
03:31:44,600 --> 03:31:49,308
TALIESIN: Yeah. I feel pretty good. I like this
plan.

2467
03:31:49,308 --> 03:31:56,662
MATT: "Okay." And she gets her holy symbol, takes
out her component pouch and begins setting up the

2468
03:31:56,662 --> 03:32:03,950
ritual for the Speak with Dead spell. It takes her
but a moment to invoke it, and her eyes glow, the

2469
03:32:03,950 --> 03:32:09,364
symbol suddenly shines this column of light onto
the corpse of Delilah Briarwood, there motionless

2470
03:32:09,364 --> 03:32:17,013
against the chair that you've bound the body. The
spell, now released, the glyphs on the ground

2471
03:32:17,013 --> 03:32:27,115
faintly glowing with this energy. Pike reaches out
and concentrates.

2472
03:32:27,115 --> 03:32:29,220
"There's no spirit."

2473
03:32:29,266 --> 03:32:33,921
LAURA: Oh shit. She's already been brought back.

2474
03:32:33,921 --> 03:32:48,406
MATT: "There's no soul to grasp. Either the soul
is beyond reach or she's not dead."

2475
03:32:48,406 --> 03:32:53,880
MARISHA: How many times are we going to have to
fight this bitch?

2476
03:32:53,880 --> 03:32:56,757
SAM: How? We have her body.

2477
03:32:56,757 --> 03:32:58,330
LAURA: She's a necromancer.

2478
03:32:58,330 --> 03:33:05,861
SAM: I don't know what that means. I'm a holy man.
I'm a priest of Ioun. I don't know about the

2479
03:33:05,861 --> 03:33:06,926
undead.

2480
03:33:06,926 --> 03:33:08,285
TRAVIS: Does he got holes?

2481
03:33:08,285 --> 03:33:10,698
SAM: My brother, please.

2482
03:33:10,698 --> 03:33:12,530
TRAVIS: My son.

2483
03:33:12,530 --> 03:33:21,100
TALIESIN: Even as a source of information, a
source of vengeance, she is a constant

2484
03:33:21,100 --> 03:33:22,496
disappointment.

2485
03:33:22,496 --> 03:33:23,810
MARISHA: Can I scry on her?

2486
03:33:23,810 --> 03:33:25,239
MATT: Do you have another spell slot to do that?

2487
03:33:25,239 --> 03:33:29,575
MARISHA: I have three 5th-level spells plus my
Scrying Eye that I haven't used yet.

2488
03:33:29,575 --> 03:33:31,017
MATT: So if you'd like to, yeah.

2489
03:33:31,017 --> 03:33:34,705
MARISHA: Yep.

2490
03:33:34,705 --> 03:33:36,828
MATT: All right.

2491
03:33:36,828 --> 03:33:39,263
LAURA: And be sneaky about it, okay?

2492
03:33:39,263 --> 03:33:41,095
TALIESIN: Wait, do we have to do it outside?

2493
03:33:41,095 --> 03:33:46,714
MARISHA: Yeah, this is another plane of existence.
We have to be on the same plane.

2494
03:33:46,714 --> 03:33:48,111
MATT: What's your spell DC?

2495
03:33:48,111 --> 03:33:49,397
MARISHA: 21.

2496
03:33:49,397 --> 03:33:58,869
MATT: You concentrate your vision and focus on the
whereabouts, perhaps, of where Delilah Briarwood

2497
03:33:58,869 --> 03:34:06,163
might be if she was on this plane. Your vision
pulls out of your body, rockets once again through

2498
03:34:06,163 --> 03:34:16,955
the stratosphere, the darkness. It's hard to place
direction, but your essence is drawn back down

2499
03:34:16,955 --> 03:34:25,028
through the clouds, over the center of a rocky
mountain range covered in snow and ice. Another

2500
03:34:25,028 --> 03:34:36,726
flash, and there you are amongst the city of Thar
Amphala. There's another flash, and you see a hole

2501
03:34:36,726 --> 03:34:47,809
in the ground, a large carved tunnel, you see
hooded figures, blurry at the edges of this vision,

2502
03:34:47,809 --> 03:34:59,774
emerging. And there you see, stepping out of the
tunnel, Delilah Briarwood, with both eyes. Steps

2503
03:34:59,774 --> 03:35:13,369
out. Her hood up, pulls it back. She glances off
to a direction you can't see and goes, "It's

2504
03:35:13,369 --> 03:35:21,367
"almost ready."

2505
03:35:21,367 --> 03:35:29,955
A voice comes in through your ear.
"Like what you see?"

2506
03:35:29,989 --> 03:35:32,436
LAURA: I hate him so much.

2507
03:35:32,436 --> 03:35:38,074
MATT: Immediately, you pull out of the scrying
experience and you look around, your friends are

2508
03:35:38,074 --> 03:35:43,463
staring at you. You guys didn't hear anything, but
once again you hear in your ear once more, "Don't

2509
03:35:43,463 --> 03:35:48,459
"worry, all shall be revealed soon enough."

2510
03:35:48,459 --> 03:35:50,353
MARISHA: Oh god!

2511
03:35:50,353 --> 03:35:58,351
MATT: "Sleep well, young Keyleth."

2512
03:35:58,351 --> 03:36:01,489
LAURA: What's going on?

2513
03:36:01,489 --> 03:36:03,727
LIAM: Where did you look? What did you see?

2514
03:36:03,727 --> 03:36:08,253
MARISHA: There's no safe place to hide. He can see
us everywhere. We should go.

2515
03:36:08,253 --> 03:36:10,652
TRAVIS: Where?

2516
03:36:10,652 --> 03:36:13,874
LAURA: You're outside of the mansion. Come in the
mansion.

2517
03:36:13,874 --> 03:36:19,840
MARISHA: What if he comes here? What if he comes
here to try and find us and he kills all of these

2518
03:36:19,840 --> 03:36:22,794
people? What if we led him here?

2519
03:36:22,794 --> 03:36:25,832
LAURA: He knows. We'll lead him anywhere,
darling.

2520
03:36:25,832 --> 03:36:27,217
LIAM: And Delilah.

2521
03:36:27,217 --> 03:36:31,932
MARISHA: She's alive. She's at Thar Amphala, both
eyes this time.

2522
03:36:31,932 --> 03:36:33,436
TALIESIN: I was going to ask.

2523
03:36:33,436 --> 03:36:34,734
LAURA: She'll remove it soon enough.

2524
03:36:34,734 --> 03:36:39,785
MARISHA: She said, "It's almost time; it's
happening soon." Whatever he's doing it's

2525
03:36:39,785 --> 03:36:54,408
happening soon and then he spoke to me in my
vision. He said my name. He knows... She's alive.

2526
03:36:54,408 --> 03:36:55,585
TALIESIN: I know.

2527
03:36:55,585 --> 03:36:56,949
MARISHA: How many times?

2528
03:36:56,949 --> 03:36:58,277
TALIESIN: As many as it takes.

2529
03:36:58,277 --> 03:37:03,198
LIAM: One more.

2530
03:37:03,198 --> 03:37:06,178
LAURA: Can you Plane Shift us from here, from the
mansion?

2531
03:37:06,178 --> 03:37:07,629
TALIESIN and MARISHA: No.

2532
03:37:07,629 --> 03:37:10,477
MATT: No, you can Plane Shift from the mansion.

2533
03:37:10,477 --> 03:37:11,945
TRAVIS: Plus, we need to rest.

2534
03:37:11,945 --> 03:37:13,156
TALIESIN: We have to rest.

2535
03:37:13,156 --> 03:37:14,490
LIAM: We'll have to do it in the morning.

2536
03:37:14,490 --> 03:37:20,404
MARISHA: I can burn my 9th-level spell and get us
there right now, but we'll lose the mansion.

2537
03:37:20,404 --> 03:37:24,075
TALIESIN: We need the mansion to sleep. We can't
sleep anywhere without the mansion.

2538
03:37:24,075 --> 03:37:30,486
MARISHA: I can sleep and I can Plane Shift us when
we wake up from this mansion.

2539
03:37:30,486 --> 03:37:32,224
LAURA: Is that a 9th-level spell?

2540
03:37:32,224 --> 03:37:42,475
MARISHA: Seventh. We could Transport via Plants. And I
found a tree to get us to--

2541
03:37:42,475 --> 03:37:44,378
MATT: Shorecomb.

2542
03:37:44,378 --> 03:37:45,976
SAM and MARISHA: Shorebottom.

2543
03:37:45,976 --> 03:37:53,381
LAURA: As awful as it is, we need to sleep, if we
can't fight him in the morning or anytime.

2544
03:37:53,381 --> 03:37:58,423
TRAVIS: We have to prepare. The tunnels have toxic
fumes and all sorts of stuff.

2545
03:37:58,423 --> 03:38:00,066
TALIESIN: We're going to have to breathe.

2546
03:38:00,066 --> 03:38:01,262
MARISHA: Go underwater.

2547
03:38:01,262 --> 03:38:03,342
TALIESIN: We're going to have to figure out a way
to survive.

2548
03:38:03,342 --> 03:38:06,694
MATT: Deal with poisoned air and breathing
underwater.

2549
03:38:06,694 --> 03:38:08,242
SAM: No problem.

2550
03:38:08,242 --> 03:38:09,504
TRAVIS: You know, like you do.

2551
03:38:09,504 --> 03:38:11,053
LIAM: Visit the Water Ashari for those--

2552
03:38:11,053 --> 03:38:15,245
LAURA: Things. Yeah, that's smart.

2553
03:38:15,245 --> 03:38:18,947
MARISHA: I could also cast Water Breathing on
eight of us.

2554
03:38:18,947 --> 03:38:20,218
TALIESIN: Will that save us from the poison?

2555
03:38:20,218 --> 03:38:24,321
MATT: Water Breathing gets you under the water,
but you still have poison in the air once you get

2556
03:38:24,321 --> 03:38:25,755
to the tubes.

2557
03:38:25,755 --> 03:38:32,914
MARISHA: Yeah, but do the things from the Water
Ashari, would those help with poison as well?

2558
03:38:32,914 --> 03:38:38,147
MATT: Those help you filter water into air. Poison
is a different thing.

2559
03:38:38,147 --> 03:38:39,664
LAURA and SAM: Heroes' Feast.

2560
03:38:39,664 --> 03:38:44,719
LAURA: Immune to poison. We have two chalices.

2561
03:38:44,719 --> 03:38:46,747
TALIESIN: From the palace.

2562
03:38:46,747 --> 03:38:48,364
SAM: Chalice from the palace?

2563
03:38:48,364 --> 03:38:49,890
TALIESIN: It's the brew that's true.

2564
03:38:49,890 --> 03:38:53,147
SAM: Okay. That could work.

2565
03:38:53,147 --> 03:38:55,063
LIAM: We have to go so many places.

2566
03:38:55,063 --> 03:38:58,450
TALIESIN: It's going to be all right. We have one
advantage that they do not.

2567
03:38:58,450 --> 03:39:01,488
SAM: Opposable thumbs.

2568
03:39:01,488 --> 03:39:12,171
TALIESIN: That too. Only one of us is
underestimating the other. We can do this.

2569
03:39:12,171 --> 03:39:13,741
LIAM: That's a good point.

2570
03:39:13,741 --> 03:39:15,283
SAM: Them.

2571
03:39:15,283 --> 03:39:20,559
TALIESIN: You're fine. We know we have to be
careful.

2572
03:39:20,559 --> 03:39:27,993
MARISHA: The plan then is sleep and then we go to
Shorecomb. And then we go under this volcano to

2573
03:39:27,993 --> 03:39:30,293
the anvil?

2574
03:39:30,293 --> 03:39:36,398
LIAM: Are we borrowing some water breathing
equipment before we go?

2575
03:39:36,398 --> 03:39:40,382
MARISHA: I can do that to us. I can cast Water
Breathing on all of us.

2576
03:39:40,382 --> 03:39:47,520
TALIESIN: Heroes' Feast, Water Breathing,
platinum, and then you're going to hit something

2577
03:39:47,520 --> 03:39:48,693
with a hammer.

2578
03:39:48,693 --> 03:39:50,661
MARISHA: Okay.

2579
03:39:50,661 --> 03:39:52,323
SAM: Bank in the morning?

2580
03:39:52,323 --> 03:39:54,138
LAURA: Bank in the morning. Then off.

2581
03:39:54,138 --> 03:39:56,302
MARISHA: And then through a tree, and then there.

2582
03:39:56,302 --> 03:39:58,749
TALIESIN and MARISHA: At dawn we bank.

2583
03:39:58,749 --> 03:40:00,123
(laughter)

2584
03:40:00,123 --> 03:40:02,916
LAURA: Fabulous. Shall we rest up?

2585
03:40:02,916 --> 03:40:03,967
TRAVIS: Yes.

2586
03:40:03,967 --> 03:40:10,852
SAM: One more thing before we go to sleep. Not to
draw this out any longer. I'm going to, right

2587
03:40:10,852 --> 03:40:20,743
before bed, attempt to turn into, using my True
Polymorph, one of those fun, winged, tall

2588
03:40:20,743 --> 03:40:23,337
creatures we met at Pelor's place.

2589
03:40:23,337 --> 03:40:24,981
LAURA: An angel?

2590
03:40:24,981 --> 03:40:31,287
MATT: Turn who into that? Yourself? Yeah, the
planetar. You can definitely do that.

2591
03:40:31,287 --> 03:40:35,156
MARISHA: With True Polymorph?

2592
03:40:35,156 --> 03:40:38,047
LAURA: You've seen it.

2593
03:40:38,047 --> 03:40:41,116
SAM: I've seen it, but I don't know it.

2594
03:40:41,116 --> 03:40:44,942
MATT: Are you doing this privately or in front of
everybody?

2595
03:40:44,942 --> 03:40:46,401
SAM: In my room.

2596
03:40:46,401 --> 03:40:58,751
MATT: In your room, you suddenly grow to the size
of an 11- to 12-foot, muscular humanoid. Bald head,

2597
03:40:58,751 --> 03:41:11,522
deep blue skin, with beautiful white angel wings
that unfurl for 24 foot, tip to tip length, you

2598
03:41:11,522 --> 03:41:13,903
feel holy power surge through your body.

2599
03:41:13,903 --> 03:41:21,954
SAM: Okay, just wanted to make sure that would
work. Cool.

2600
03:41:21,998 --> 03:41:23,711
TRAVIS: Do you do anything?

2601
03:41:23,711 --> 03:41:31,349
SAM: No, I just stand there naked looking at
myself. Anything else that happens in that room,

2602
03:41:31,349 --> 03:41:35,380
you don't want to know.

2603
03:41:35,380 --> 03:41:42,425
MATT: As the winged Dr. Manhattan stands there in
his room, staring at his own Manhattan junk--

2604
03:41:42,425 --> 03:41:46,876
LIAM: So this is what it sounds like when doves
cry!

2605
03:41:46,876 --> 03:41:53,215
MATT: There's a slow rendition of Hallelujah as
you touch yourself for the night.

2606
03:41:53,215 --> 03:42:01,438
(singing) Hallelujah, hallelujah.

2607
03:42:01,438 --> 03:42:03,973
(speaking) The wings curl
in. All right.

2608
03:42:03,973 --> 03:42:07,290
LIAM: That was the most home-game moment we've
ever had.

2609
03:42:07,290 --> 03:42:16,287
MATT: And on that note, we're going to close
tonight's episode. (laughs) All right, guys,

2610
03:42:16,287 --> 03:42:22,621
thanks again for playing, thank you guys for
watching. Thank you once again Darin De Paul for

2611
03:42:22,621 --> 03:42:27,657
coming and guesting, closing Sprigg's story in an
interesting way. I wasn't sure how he was going to

2612
03:42:27,657 --> 03:42:38,022
do that. We'll see you guys next week. Be safe,
love each other, and is it Thursday yet? Good

2613
03:42:38,022 --> 03:42:39,110
night.

2614
03:42:39,110 --> 03:42:44,029
ALL: (singing) Hallelujah!

2615
03:42:44,029 --> 03:50:03,734
