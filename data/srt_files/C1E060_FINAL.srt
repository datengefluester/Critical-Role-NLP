1
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:10,066
(cheering)

2
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:18,900
KEVIN: All right! (cheers) Welcome! Is my mic on?
It's on, whoa, yeah, welcome to the very first

3
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:30,076
inaugural premiere edition of Critical Role live!
Guys, my name's Kevin. I am the social media

4
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:38,006
director for Geek and Sundry-- yes, thank you very
much, I am indeed a very cool person. I've been

5
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:42,392
with Geek and Sundry for about eight months now,
it was really intimidating at first because I kept

6
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:51,412
mixing up Vax and Vex. Yeah, I still mix up Vax
and Vex. But okay, what I was going to say was

7
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:55,150
that Critical Role fans are the warmest, most
welcoming fans.

8
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,238
(cheering)

9
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:05,424
KEVIN: Yeah! Except for that guy. Right? But no, I
love you guys, give yourselves a big hand, thank

10
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:06,667
you so much.

11
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,668
(cheering)

12
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:13,537
KEVIN: I want you guys to know, this is our first
time doing this, this is as I said the first

13
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:21,976
inaugural premiere, they're all synonyms, right?
So if you're like me you're extremely excited. But

14
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:26,264
please remember that all the people at home are
still watching, say hi to the people at home, hi

15
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:27,464
people at home.

16
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:28,816
AUDIENCE: Hi!

17
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:34,272
KEVIN: Right? So please do me a favor, put your
phones on silent, all right? The house lights are

18
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:38,041
going to be kind of dim, so you can use your
phones, you can tweet, you can do social media

19
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:43,337
posts, whatever you want, if there's a Cubone
somewhere please let me know, tweet at me. I need

20
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:52,102
like ten Cubones. So yeah, just put everything on
silent and be silent about it. You can tweet about

21
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:55,971
the show, please use the hashtag
#CriticalRoleLive, surprisingly enough. Do me

22
00:01:55,971 --> 00:02:01,569
another favor, don't do the concert pic thing
where you put your phone up and record for ten

23
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:05,925
minutes at a time, because there are people behind
you, as you may or may not know, so I'd really

24
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:14,055
appreciate that. The other thing is, this not a
Rocky Horror thing, so don't shout out like, I

25
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:18,216
would like to rage. Don't do that stuff, don't
"how do you want to do this?" Don't do that stuff.

26
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:25,620
Be respectful of the people on stage. Think of
this as a funny play. You can laugh, you can woo,

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,940
but maybe don't shout out suggestions. Especially
the suggestions that I know a lot of you have in

28
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:41,601
your heads, right? Wait, I have one other thing.
There's a merch thing. The merch table's going to

29
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:46,321
be open after the show, is that right? Yes. After
the show, the merch table's going to be open, so

30
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,059
if you didn't get a chance to get merch, you're
going to get another chance to get merch, so don't

31
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:55,189
worry about that. Is there something else? VIPs
will get your posters after, so if you're a VIP,

32
00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:05,834
you'll get a poster, just come-- where? Upstairs.
Okay. Don't worry. Right. Thank you. Let's hear it

33
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,246
for Claudia once again, guys.

34
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:14,101
(cheering)

35
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:16,859
KEVIN: All right, so, do you guys want to bring
them out?

36
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:19,268
(cheering)

37
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:26,615
KEVIN: All right. Let's start with the master of
dick-lightning and shit-scrying, playing Scanlan

38
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,582
Shorthalt, Mr. Sam Riegel!

39
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:34,261
(cheering)

40
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:35,984
KEVIN: All right!

41
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:41,731
SAM: Thanks! You get a car! You get a car! You get
a car!

42
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:51,026
KEVIN: Guys, get your tickets to the gun show,
because the gun show's coming to town. Playing

43
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:57,046
Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de
Rolo III of Whitestone. Yeah, right, right.

44
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:59,771
Taliesin, let's bring him out, Taliesin Jaffe!

45
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:15,247
(cheering)

46
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:20,300
KEVIN: Guys, put your hands together, put your
antlers on your head, for Keyleth. Marisha Ray!

47
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:30,999
(cheering)

48
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:39,968
KEVIN: Is she here? She's so stealthy, I don't
understand.

49
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:43,052
MARISHA: I'm an independent woman, all right?

50
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,636
TALIESIN: Never mind, I give up.

51
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:47,719
KEVIN: All right, let's bring out the man I have a
massive man-crush on--

52
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,075
SAM: I'm already here!

53
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:52,818
KEVIN: Liam O'Brien as Vax'ildan!

54
00:04:52,818 --> 00:05:04,764
(cheering)

55
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,132
LIAM: What the hell!

56
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:14,306
KEVIN: This next woman was stuffing exotic animals
into tiny balls before it was cool. Laura Bailey

57
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:15,715
as Vex'ahlia!

58
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:28,607
(cheering)

59
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:31,071
KEVIN: She's got the hipster glasses to prove it.

60
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:34,232
LAURA: Yeah, that's right. It's not for seeing at
all, I don't...

61
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:42,171
KEVIN: And the next guy, the next guy, get out
your tubs of mayo for Mr. Travis Willingham as

62
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,003
Grog freaking Strongjaw!

63
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:55,972
(cheering and chanting)

64
00:05:55,972 --> 00:06:04,059
KEVIN: All right, let's, let's bring it down.
Guys, there are certain names that people whisper

65
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:11,220
with reverence. Because those names belong to the
breakthrough artists in their field. Jim Henson,

66
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,079
Bob Dylan, Madame Curie.

67
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,887
(laughter)

68
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:21,988
KEVIN: Tonight we have one of those names with us.
You may know him. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Matt

69
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,013
Mercer.

70
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:45,049
(cheering)

71
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:48,875
MATT: Oh boy. That's a lot, that's a lot of
people.

72
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,953
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

73
00:06:52,953 --> 00:07:02,543
MATT: All righty, let me shore up my positioning
here on the camera for you fine folks and open my

74
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,408
energy drink because that's what makes this show
happen.

75
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,219
TRAVIS: Caffeine and drugs.

76
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:16,992
MATT: (shushing noises) Anyway, welcome everybody
to our first Critical Role live, all of you folks

77
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:21,054
there on the internet and everyone here in person
in Los Angeles, California.

78
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:25,692
(cheering)

79
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:31,435
MATT: Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of
us nerdy-ass voice actors get together, roll dice,

80
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:38,218
and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight we have a
fantastic pick-up of last week's story where the

81
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:43,525
adventuring party Vox Machina found themselves
wandering through the Feywild. However, before

82
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:48,935
that happens, let us get to our fantastic sponsor
for the evening. Once again, this episode is

83
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:54,155
brought to you by Loot Crate, they've been
awesome. So thank you guys so much.

84
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:58,146
(cheering)

85
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:03,610
MATT: The current Loot Crate theme for July is
Futuristic, includes a lot of awesome Rick and

86
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,868
Morty, Futurama, Mega Man, Valiant Comic stuff,
Star Trek, that fun element there. We've got music

87
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:15,352
playing, it's on. Oh man, I feel like things are
happening.

88
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:17,100
SAM: Music's working?

89
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,778
LAURA: Music works, you guys, music works.

90
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:26,758
MATT: There we go. Perfect. Tech stuff is coming
together. Yeah, so Futuristic is their crate theme

91
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:34,870
this month. We also have the anime Loot Crate is
themed Squadron. Has a bunch of stuff from Gundam,

92
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,367
Gate, Arpeggio of Blue Steel, Antimagic Academy, a
lot of exclusive stuff, of course you guys can go

93
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:45,044
ahead and get $3 off a subscription by going to
lootcrate.com/criticalrole and putting in

94
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:50,131
"criticalrole," one word, in your nice little Loot
Crate subscription bonus.

95
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:56,786
TRAVIS: I chew on Goku's head a lot. I'm a
fixated-- it's cool.

96
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,878
MATT: And the paint is actually healthy to eat,
apparently. That's not at all the reason why

97
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:06,899
Grog's intelligence is that low. So, if you
haven't checked it out yet, check out Loot Crate,

98
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:14,221
thank you guys so much for sponsoring our show, we
love you. Great. So. Next up we have-- we recently

99
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:20,127
had a t-shirt contest, didn't we? Laura, if you
want to take that away for me.

100
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,735
LAURA: Oh, this? Okay, so I get to announce who
the official winner is?

101
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:23,875
MATT: You do, actually, yeah.

102
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:28,332
LAURA: Oh my gosh, this is so exciting. Okay. So
the official winner of the first Critter contest

103
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:33,638
is... Against the Chroma Conclave, designed by
Antmageddon!

104
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:44,171
(cheering)

105
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:50,602
LAURA: So! As of right now, that shirt is
available in the Geek and Sundry store for

106
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:55,824
preorder. It's going to be there for I think two
weeks? And it's available in sizes small through

107
00:09:55,824 --> 00:10:01,088
3XL, which we're really excited about. And yeah,
so that's that, so.

108
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:02,091
TRAVIS: Go get one!

109
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:05,704
LAURA: Go you guys for voting on that, you rock,
even with shenanigans.

110
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:10,971
MATT: There were so many amazing contenders for
that contest that the community puts out, so we--

111
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:14,038
MARISHA: And we got hacked, which means we made
it.

112
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:19,995
MATT: Yay! Next announcement I have, when I
arrived here I discovered that there was an actual

113
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:25,275
PokeGym as a part of this mall, I'd like to ask
Team Valor to go ahead and make sure that shit

114
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,568
leaves red.

115
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:33,774
(cheering and booing)

116
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,023
TRAVIS: What a response!

117
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:36,648
LAURA: That was a mixed reaction.

118
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:44,833
MATT: Look, the whole San Fernando Valley's blue,
okay, give me something! All right, anyway. Yeah,

119
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:51,467
it's become a thing. And we have another cool
announcement. Travis, do you want to take it away

120
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,289
on that one?

121
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:57,172
TRAVIS: Yes we do, the response to this live event
was so amazing that we are super stoked to

122
00:10:57,172 --> 00:11:03,477
announce that we are going to also be doing
Critical Role live in Indianapolis during GenCon

123
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:10,453
on August 6, Saturday night. Tickets will go on
sale- I think they're on sale now.

124
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:11,582
LAURA: Right now.

125
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:14,523
TRAVIS: Right now, so if you want to like,
silently on your phone or just ignore it because

126
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:18,318
it's a much bigger venue, so tickets should be
available, but we're all going to be in

127
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:22,915
Indianapolis on Saturday night and GenCon to roll
some dice with you bitches live.

128
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:27,653
(cheering)

129
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:32,457
MATT: Hell yeah. So if this wasn't nerve-wracking
enough for me, we have another one in a

130
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:34,134
couple of weeks.

131
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,973
TRAVIS: Pressure's on, dude, pressure's on!

132
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,778
MATT: But I'm super stoked, it's going to be my
first time at GenCon, I've been wanting to go for

133
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:45,758
many years and this is a nice way to go, I guess.
So. Check it out. Hopefully we'll see you guys

134
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:50,688
there. That brings us to the end of our
announcements and will bring us down--

135
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:56,043
LAURA: Wait. Before we go into not-regular
announcements, should we make sure that people

136
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:58,230
know that we're not having an episode next week
because of Comic-Con?

137
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,397
MATT: That's true, actually, yeah.

138
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,312
SAM: Way to bring down the room.

139
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,645
LAURA: I'm sorry, guys.

140
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:08,168
MATT: Because all the company, everyone's going to
be at Comic-Con doing panels and scheduling and

141
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:12,155
stuff, there will be no episode next week, but I
promise that we'll make the episode the week after

142
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:13,640
that extra cool.

143
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,106
(cheering)

144
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:24,983
MATT: I hope. So yeah, let's go ahead and dive
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

145
00:12:24,983 --> 00:13:55,760
[dramatic music]

146
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,214
SAM: We're on!

147
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:10,379
(cheering)

148
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,410
MATT: All right, all right, we've got to do a
story here! It's appreciated, but--

149
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,997
SAM: We should probably just finish.

150
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:28,436
MATT: All right, so, bringing us in now, back to
tonight's episode of Critical Role. Guys, pay

151
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,853
attention.

152
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:32,301
LIAM: Illithid syphilis.

153
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,754
MATT: The camera's already on.

154
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,003
LIAM: Yeah. Okay.

155
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:39,702
MATT: So. Our intrepid band of adventurers, Vox
Machina, found themselves recently traversing the

156
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:45,413
Feywild in search of another Vestige of
Divergence. In doing so, they managed to find an

157
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:50,702
old friend in the nymph Nahla, acquired some
information, trading a book, and found their way

158
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:55,444
towards the ever-shifting grasses northward in
search of where the Divergence, the object of the

159
00:14:55,444 --> 00:15:01,871
Divergence lies. In doing so, they found a new
ally, a new friend. A little satyr by the name of,

160
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,201
where is it here--

161
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:05,394
ALL: Garmelie.

162
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:10,931
MATT: Garmelie, thank you. Now Garmelie, who had
made some really interesting sketches of the party

163
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:17,914
upon being caught was then dragged into Scanlan's
magnificent mansion, at which Pike asked him to

164
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:22,580
make a fantastic mural for the interior of that
place, which I think still resides there to this

165
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:30,969
day. And on the internet, as we've discovered.
Upon traveling further north, hopefully to find

166
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:38,034
their final destination in the form of the
Shademirk Bog, where the Fenthras bow seemingly

167
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:47,377
exists, you instead came upon Syngorn, the city
from the youthful days of Vex and Vax. Upon

168
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:52,108
speaking to the head-- pardon me; you see, all the
nerves gets the belching out. It works out well.

169
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:59,390
Upon encountering Watcher Iova watching the gate,
recognizing the twins, let them within the actual

170
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:06,058
city of Syngorn. And that is where we left off.
So, as you guys walk through the beautiful verdant

171
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:11,967
city, tall seemingly endless trees around you,
many buildings naturally formed and built from

172
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:22,007
smoothly carved stone, various ancient <i>sigils</i>
carved throughout the entire cityscape, the very

173
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:28,029
heavy-armored Verdant Guard gathered in places,
and a general air of intensity and building

174
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:34,065
military might within the city of Syngorn, you
have your invisible companion Garmelie, who at

175
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:38,555
some point in the near future agreed to tell you
what it is he wishes you to steal for him as part

176
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:42,813
of the deal that was made by the twins. So. What
would you like to do?

177
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:46,119
LIAM: I feel like I should be very stern right
now, but I can't stop smiling.

178
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:51,032
TRAVIS: You're gloomy. Lock it up, here we go.

179
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:53,664
LAURA: I feel like the first thing we need to do
is go see our father.

180
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:56,771
LIAM: Right off the bat?

181
00:16:56,771 --> 00:17:00,277
LAURA: He's the one that's going to give us access
to the rest of the city.

182
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:05,293
LIAM: All right. Is Iova still here, or has she
trundled off?

183
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:09,451
MATT: She's walked off. She literally let you guys
in the city and went, do what you've got to do,

184
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:10,947
and then turned away and the rest of the guards--

185
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,841
LAURA: Oh seriously, so like... no, no the guard
is following us.

186
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:16,462
LIAM: And we remember where we're going, right,
because it's all the same as it was.

187
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,985
MATT: The city is the same as it was.

188
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:22,049
LIAM: Well, I imagine we'd go to his home. Our
home. His home.

189
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:24,221
LAURA: What time is it? I mean, we don't know what
time it is.

190
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:25,603
TALIESIN: It's dusk.

191
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,181
LAURA: Thank you, Percy.

192
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,779
SAM: But we just woke up.

193
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:30,489
LAURA: All right. Okay.

194
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,131
LIAM: Look at all those elves.

195
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,510
LAURA: So many elves.

196
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,187
TRAVIS: Is the little satyr-- is he holding onto
my skirts, basically?

197
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:42,953
MATT: You actually don't feel a general presence,
and then as you move you feel a

198
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:44,420
slight tug at your belt.

199
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,708
TRAVIS: Right, so can I like, how far away is that
guard that's on our tail?

200
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,811
MATT: About 15, 20 feet back.

201
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:57,177
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Can I like super slyly whisper,
okay, so at any point are you going to tell us

202
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,884
what it is you want us to fucking steal?

203
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:06,563
MATT: You hear a whispered voice that curls up by
your ear, strangely given the fact that he's so

204
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:12,196
small, so the voice is being thrown right into the
side of your eardrum, goes, "Just be quiet! Find a

205
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:17,804
"place in which we can speak privately, and then I
will be happy to tell you. Shh! Stop talking to

206
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,160
"the air; it upsets them."

207
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,935
TRAVIS: It's really quite normal for me.

208
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:28,542
LAURA: Hey, Grog. You should really watch that gas
of yours with him back there.

209
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:33,717
TRAVIS: Oh, you're so right. Hey, pull my finger.
(fart sound)

210
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:36,762
MATT: (coughs)

211
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:46,436
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's the family reserve. Oh, he
said we're supposed to find somewhere

212
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:48,358
quiet to talk.

213
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,914
LIAM: Maybe we should do that first, actually.

214
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:54,570
LAURA: We have guards fucking following us. We have
to go find our father.

215
00:18:54,616 --> 00:19:00,387
TALIESIN: We also don't know where we're sleeping
tonight, or whether or not it's even permissible.

216
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:04,129
We should probably have a conversation with
whoever's in charge. Is your father in charge?

217
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:05,156
LIAM: No.

218
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:06,053
LAURA: Ish.

219
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:07,153
TALIESIN: Ish.

220
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,458
LIAM: He's a bureaucrat.

221
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,423
TALIESIN: Excellent.

222
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:12,093
(laughter)

223
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:20,172
LIAM: All right, let's go see Dad, then.

224
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,911
MARISHA: (whispers) Grog.

225
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:22,835
TRAVIS: What?

226
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:25,758
MARISHA: (whispers) Your pants, they're sagging a
little bit, why?

227
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,007
TRAVIS: What?

228
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,157
MARISHA: (whispers) They're sagging.

229
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:33,777
TRAVIS: Oh, it's like the new rage amongst the
kids. It gives me super street cred.

230
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:36,352
MARISHA: Where's Garmelie?

231
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:39,239
LAURA: Keyleth, shut up about Garmelie!

232
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:45,562
TRAVIS: Yeah, ix-nay on the Garmelie-- I think I'm
doing Pig Latin wrong. Yeah.

233
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:49,558
LIAM: It's this way. And I start walking off
towards Dad's house.

234
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:50,871
TALIESIN: I'm going to follow the twins.

235
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,809
SAM: Sounds good.

236
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:59,986
MARISHA: I look regal and as we pass elves I say,
good day.

237
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:06,905
MATT: The few that look in your direction,
Keyleth, take a moment to nod, look you over and

238
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:13,564
then continue walking, seemingly perturbed by the
sudden interaction and the immediate realization

239
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:15,849
that you're not of full blood.

240
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,331
LAURA: Yeah, sorry Keyleth, your ears aren't large
enough.

241
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:23,054
MARISHA: That's not normally what people tell me.

242
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,490
SAM: It's not the size of your ears...

243
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,538
MARISHA: That's right.

244
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:34,795
MATT: So. As you guys continue following Vax'ildan
towards the abode of their father, you keep an eye

245
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:41,023
out towards the rest of Syngorn proper. You see
the further into the city you go, interspersed with

246
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:47,523
a few Emon guards, you see a handful of
individuals that are human, and they're dressed in

247
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:53,217
the actual attire of the guards of Emon, and
they're intermingling right now with the Verdant

248
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:55,817
Guard, the military might within Syngorn.

249
00:20:55,817 --> 00:21:01,233
MARISHA: What were the name of the guards in Emon?
Did they have a name?

250
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:02,586
MATT: The Emon guard.

251
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:03,852
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

252
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:09,378
MATT: There is a name, and it's somewhere in my
notes but we're good.

253
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:16,038
TALIESIN: From this perspective, I can see your
panic folder. It's so exciting. That's where the

254
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:17,058
magic happens.

255
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,535
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true, we never really see
that!

256
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:19,771
TALIESIN: This is exciting for us.

257
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:28,325
(laughter)

258
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:35,484
MATT: So. You guys continue making your way
towards the abode. After traversing on the

259
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:44,285
outskirts of what would be the tangleward side of
the city, the eastern side, you travel in through

260
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:49,527
an area of buildings that are very beautifully
crafted, many of which seem to have stemmed from

261
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:52,840
some sort of a tree growth, but upon closer look
you can see that it's actually carved stone to

262
00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:00,313
resemble a tree. And then it eventually rises up
into a somewhat spherical building, and there are

263
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:05,313
many that build off of that to create this kind of
neighborhood of various elven abodes within

264
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:06,323
Syngorn.

265
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:07,650
LIAM: Fucking hate this place.

266
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,018
LAURA: Me, too. It's hideous.

267
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:14,510
MARISHA: This is gorgeous. Look at the
craftsmanship. It's incredible.

268
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,553
SAM: Good day.

269
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:17,786
MARISHA: Good day.

270
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:23,642
MATT: You make your way towards the end of this
particular--

271
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,576
(laughter)

272
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:34,564
MATT: The guards still keeping track behind you.
You find your way to the end of the main road, and

273
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:38,820
it splits into two smaller avenues. You know to
take the left that leads deeper into the more

274
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,974
political family houses of Syngorn. While your
family is not a political house per se, your

275
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:51,977
father, as an ambassador to Emon, was given a home
in this location. It is your old home, although it

276
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:57,083
appears to have been even further renovated and is
much nicer than you remember, but the door is

277
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:03,818
closed and the dusk sun leads you to pause as you
look upon the outside of this abode you have not

278
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:06,093
seen in many, many years.

279
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,305
SAM: Do you want me to burn it down?

280
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,942
LAURA: Yes.

281
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:18,312
TRAVIS: No, just seriously, you seem super gloomy.
Are we getting in a fight?

282
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:19,768
LAURA: No. No fights.

283
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:27,220
MATT: The guards now step up and flank a little
bit, keeping a close eye as you've now approached and

284
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:33,199
effectively knocked on the handle of a relatively
middle-to-high-ranking individual within Syngorean

285
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:40,374
society. Eventually the door opens and you see a
woman standing there: bright blonde hair, braided

286
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:47,567
and tied up in the back. She's wearing more of a
work-gown for the day. You recognize her as

287
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:53,526
Devana, the new wife of Syldor, the one that you
had once met before in Emon when you guys came

288
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:59,024
upon your father last time. As the door opens up,
she looks out for a second, taking in the whole

289
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:08,573
group that has gathered on the outside of their
home and goes, "My god. Vax'ildan, Vex'ahlia, we

290
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,287
"weren't expecting you!"

291
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:15,259
LAURA: No. I can't imagine you were. Is he here?

292
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:17,416
MATT: "He is."

293
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,681
LAURA: What time is it?

294
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:27,477
MATT: She glances out, looks up. "That's always a
good question. The longer we stay in these realms,

295
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:30,162
"the more confused my daughter becomes."

296
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:32,131
LIAM: How long has that been?

297
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:36,138
MATT: "Weeks now, I assume. Best that our
timepieces can keep."

298
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:38,770
LAURA: Is Velora around?

299
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,663
MATT: "She is, would you like to see her?"

300
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:41,872
LAURA: Of course.

301
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:44,452
MATT: "Come in. Is it just you two?"

302
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:45,960
LAURA and LIAM: No.

303
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,804
LAURA: It's everyone.

304
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:48,977
TRAVIS: Hi.

305
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:51,838
LAURA: And Trinket, you remember Trinket.

306
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:59,228
MATT: (bear noises) Nudges your arm to the side
and comes forward and sniffs out to Devana. She

307
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:02,366
shrinks back a little bit and reaches her hand out
to the nose and taps the edge of Trinket's face,

308
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:05,670
and Trinket licks her fingers.

309
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,676
MARISHA: Good day.

310
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,166
SAM: Good day.

311
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:11,464
MARISHA: Good day. They respond better if you say
"good day" and if you have your head up.

312
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:13,013
TRAVIS: If we say "bidet?"

313
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,741
MARISHA: Bidet, yes. Good day.

314
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:16,809
TRAVIS: Bidet.

315
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:21,693
TALIESIN: So close. So very close.

316
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:24,979
MATT: The two guards closest to you, within their
helmets their eyes narrow, they look at each other

317
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:26,303
and shake their heads.

318
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:27,803
TRAVIS: Oh, bidet.

319
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:31,988
LIAM: Your accent is perfect. Don't change a
thing.

320
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:40,433
MATT: Devana goes, "Very well. If you would all
proceed to be quiet if you could, Syldor is

321
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:44,659
"working. And you may stay outside," she says to
the guards.

322
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,520
And they both, "We were given orders, milady,
to--"

323
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,474
"I understand that. But this is already a lot of
people in our home. Stay close within earshot,

324
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:58,948
"it'll be fine. I trust them." The guards, (sighs)

325
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:01,003
LAURA: I wink at them as I walk inside.

326
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:08,635
MATT: No reaction whatsoever. You guys make your
way into the home and are immediately caught with

327
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:14,991
a very strong smell of cedar. It's a very
pleasant-smelling home, and the hearth is warm.

328
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:22,975
It's everything you wanted your home to be, and it
immediately hits you to walk in here and see this

329
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:27,657
kind of life away from a life, seeing elements of
it that remind you of your childhood, things about

330
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:33,148
it that flag memories to your head of good times
and bad, in just a few mere moments. And at that

331
00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:39,691
same time, there's a sadness because so much of it
has changed, so much of it seems better than the

332
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:47,580
memory. And for a moment there, you feel a little
tinge of wondering how different it might've been.

333
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,191
At which point that thought process is broken as
Devana steps in and goes,

334
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,692
"Would anyone like tea, perhaps?"

335
00:26:54,692 --> 00:26:57,919
SAM: Sure, yes, do you have an oolong?

336
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,469
MARISHA: Maybe a chamomile, it would be great.

337
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:06,523
MATT: "Something like that, yes. It's been a
little scarce in the Feywilds. More difficult to

338
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:08,309
"farm herbs here than you'd think."

339
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:12,948
MARISHA: Oh, here. I pull out some herbs that I
brought from my garden.

340
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:16,292
Some glisfoil and other things.

341
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:18,516
MATT: "Thank you. Appreciate that."

342
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:22,810
MARISHA: They won't scream at you when you pick
them. Good. It's good.

343
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:29,536
MATT: "Thank you. What was your name again?"

344
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,625
MARISHA: Oh, I'm Keyleth of the Ashari.

345
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:35,163
MATT: "A pleasure to meet you again--"

346
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:36,445
MARISHA: Good day.

347
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:41,348
MATT: "That's, that's really not necessary in my
home. You, sir, your name?"

348
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:43,858
TALIESIN: Whatever's available would be just
fine.

349
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:45,736
SAM and MARISHA: I think she means your name.

350
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:48,201
MATT: "That's a curious title."

351
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,978
MARISHA: But you can call him whatever's
available, as well.

352
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:53,783
MATT: "Very well, coffee table. What's your
name?"

353
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,101
(laughter)

354
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:57,522
LIAM: It's easier than the actual name.

355
00:27:57,522 --> 00:28:02,803
TALIESIN: For you, it is just Percival, and I am
another visiting royal from man's world.

356
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:05,157
MATT: "All right. You, sir?"

357
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:19,571
SAM: I am called the Kingslayer, Chuck Norris,
Burt Reynolds. I have many names. You see, when

358
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:22,012
you've traveled a road as long as I have--

359
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:26,539
MATT: "Black tea, got it. And you, sir, the large
one?"

360
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:31,398
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Bidet. The name is Grog.

361
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:38,269
MATT: "Very well. I'll return with Syldor once he
knows you're here. It may be a while if you don't

362
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,804
"mind waiting, but the tea will come out
posthaste."

363
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,840
LAURA: And Velora? Where's she?

364
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,585
MATT: "Let me get her for you, she'll be very like
to see both of you, she asks from time to time."

365
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:51,857
She brushes a little lock of hair that's fallen in
front of her face behind her ear, and smiles and

366
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:58,174
darts off towards the kitchen. A few moments pass with
you guys sitting in awkward silence, looking about

367
00:28:58,218 --> 00:29:04,434
the space in the vicinity. Looks to the twins.
Eventually Devana comes out and sets tea for all

368
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:09,440
of you across the central table in this meeting
area, and behind her you see, clutching the edge

369
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:17,091
of the skirt, you see this tiny, long brown hair
that is braided, but the braid's coming undone,

370
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:24,440
tomboyish looking elven girl that peeks around the
side of her dress and hides

371
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,713
again behind the back.

372
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:29,447
[high-pitched noise]

373
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:31,092
MATT: Welcome back, sorry about that.

374
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:33,906
(cheering)

375
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,178
SAM: What a battle!

376
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:39,888
MATT: The technical aspects. We're working through
it, but we got through it, thank you for your

377
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:46,648
patience. So the last few minutes, we're not quite
sure how much you guys may have missed, but the

378
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:51,712
party wiped. We're rolling up new characters. No,
for the Monday episode we'll go ahead and make

379
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:54,681
sure to splice in anything that may have been
missed for the past minute. But the party had come

380
00:29:54,681 --> 00:30:01,560
to the home of Syldor, the father of Vax and Vex.
They had a brief discussion with Devana, his new

381
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:07,278
wife. They were given tea after introductions and
then briefly discussed the merits of being a

382
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:15,598
warrior with their half-sister Velora Vessar, and
upon discussing apparently a war of some kind,

383
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:21,606
Syldor made his way into the room, and you look
and you see the long dark hair of Syldor, his pale

384
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:27,835
complexion, his stern face, staring back at you
all from within the doorway as he closes it behind

385
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:32,171
him and steps into the room. You see Devana sits
up now and comes over to him and says,

386
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:36,086
"My dear, would you like us to leave you alone?"

387
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:41,946
He goes, "Don't worry, it will be fine. Have a
seat. Besides, we're all family.

388
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:45,338
"Well, some of us, at least." 
And he looks over to Grog.

389
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:46,840
TRAVIS: Bidet.

390
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,134
(laughter)

391
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:57,327
MATT: "Good day, indeed." He comes up and sits,
and he's wearing long, dark brown robes with

392
00:30:57,327 --> 00:31:05,427
golden and red embroidery on the side, but it's
very casual home wear, and he sits down, pulling

393
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:09,791
up a chair across from you guys in this area, and
takes one of the cups of tea and sips it. And you

394
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:15,536
can see there's an intensity to his face. He's
here, and he looks like he's partially

395
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:22,259
inconvenienced by your presence like he always
did, but he also looks like he hasn't slept well,

396
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:29,241
there's some dark circles under his eyes and he
seems a little distracted for such a climactic

397
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,626
re-meeting.

398
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:32,174
LAURA: Surprise!

399
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:41,819
MATT: "Surprise, indeed. So. It's good to see you
both. Glad you're in good health. You've come

400
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:48,233
"quite a ways to come speak with me, being as we
currently reside within the Feywild."

401
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:55,067
LIAM: It's a little bit further than we thought
we'd have to travel, why... the presence around

402
00:31:55,067 --> 00:32:00,888
the city we're seeing? We understand why you fled,
but what's going on?

403
00:32:00,888 --> 00:32:12,635
MATT: "Look. We had the entire Fort Daxio army
down here and we were to give aid to push into the

404
00:32:12,635 --> 00:32:17,070
"nearby mountain range where apparently there was
an influx of lizardfolk, had been a continuous

405
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:24,983
"problem, and apparently a break had been seen
somewhere. However, we had sent most of our forces

406
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:31,079
"into the mountain range and then received word
that three great drakes were making their way

407
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:37,856
"straight toward Syngorn after the destruction of
Emon. Knowing that, we had no recourse but to flee

408
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:43,645
"and prepare when it was time. Had we stood our
ground, we would be the same burning crater that

409
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:45,313
"your fair city is now."

410
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:50,600
LAURA: So you intend to go back? You're amassing
this army to go back and join the fight.

411
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,733
MATT: "That is exactly what we're doing. The
remnants of the Emon army we currently have here

412
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:01,744
"in the city, we've been building armor and weapons
to make sure the most sure-footed and

413
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:06,198
"strong-of-arm men and women of our fair city can
make it to that battlefield

414
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:07,645
"and tear that beast down."

415
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:11,071
LAURA: That's wonderful news.

416
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:14,631
MATT: "Good. Why are you here?"

417
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:20,947
TALIESIN: We are here on a very similar range of
business, to be honest.

418
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,413
MATT: "And you are?"

419
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:30,320
TALIESIN: Ah, yes. Percival Fredrickstein von
Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III of the royal house

420
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,506
of Whitestone, representative of man's world, here
on very important business dealing with dragons.

421
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:48,937
We are looking for some objects: a few things that
may help us in our fight against these dragons

422
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:52,872
that have attacked us. We've already made headway
against them, and we've already made headway on

423
00:33:52,872 --> 00:34:00,413
our quest to destroy them. Any help that your
wonderful city could provide would be most

424
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,757
agreeable.

425
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:11,601
MATT: "Well. We currently have all of our
resources engaged in our plans of attack. There is

426
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:16,529
"not much we could offer you other than, if you
wish to stay here within the city, we could

427
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:22,527
"provide a place to sleep, food, and when the time
is right you may join our ranks into the fray."

428
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,149
LIAM: We've come to the Feywild for something
specific.

429
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:28,853
MARISHA: We're trying to head to the Shademirk
Bog.

430
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:33,204
MATT: "Why on earth would you be heading to the
Shademirk?"

431
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:40,607
MARISHA: We're looking for the bow of Fenthras. It
supposedly lives inside of a cancerous tree.

432
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:49,146
MATT: "Right. Well. Good luck with that."

433
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:52,292
LAURA: Do you think it's possible?

434
00:34:52,292 --> 00:35:02,415
MATT: "I think it's a fool's errand to chase a
fleeting rumor into a location that is known to

435
00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:09,286
"devour and destroy anyone who steps within its
bounds. But by all means, you've always been ones

436
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:11,604
"seeking the darkness."

437
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:16,445
LIAM: He and I are wearing fleeting rumors. That
one's got one hidden up his butt.

438
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:25,641
(laughter)

439
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:30,964
MATT: You hear Velora chuckle. Devana's like,
"Shh! Quiet!"

440
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:34,231
LAURA: I want to pull Velora over and sit her in
my lap.

441
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:38,320
MATT: She (raspberry noise) at her mom as you pick
her up there. You can see Devana smiles as she

442
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,714
does so.

443
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:49,443
LIAM: Syldor, we have killed two of these dragons
already. Nothing could please me more to hear that

444
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:54,693
you are amassing forces here to go back; that is
possibly the greatest thing I've ever heard you

445
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:56,775
say to me.

446
00:35:56,775 --> 00:35:59,293
LAURA: I want to insight check him and see if he's
really saying--

447
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,476
TRAVIS: Yeah, do that shit!

448
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,159
MATT: Roll an insight check.

449
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,453
LIAM: Him or me?

450
00:36:07,453 --> 00:36:10,181
LAURA: 26 on him!

451
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:18,840
MATT: All right. I'd whisper, but the microphone
makes it useless. It's fine. He appears tired, he

452
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,516
appears like a lot of his intention and time has
been put towards something important--

453
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:24,951
LAURA: Being a giant dick?

454
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:33,681
MATT: Possibly. But he doesn't appear to be lying
or fudging the truth at all, he's just tired. He

455
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:43,176
says, "Look. There are a lot of pieces at work
here. If you have your own path, by all means. And

456
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:50,538
"while I have heard of some of your exploits, and I
am quite impressed, I hate to be blunt, but it's

457
00:36:50,538 --> 00:37:01,789
"difficult and strange to mingle family new and
old. Your presence here brings up difficult

458
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,560
"memories for me."

459
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,431
LAURA: Oh, you poor man.

460
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:14,608
LIAM: Don't worry. We're not here to look for
family. That would entail some amount of

461
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:23,498
investment on either our side or yours. There is
clearly none. We are here to do business. Do you

462
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:25,475
know where the bog is?

463
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:30,423
MATT: "Yes. It's duskward of here."

464
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:32,053
SAM: Duskward.

465
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:35,611
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

466
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:41,731
LIAM: Well, some people go this way, and some
people go that way, and some people go both ways.

467
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:45,418
MARISHA: It's like being on a ship forever.

468
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:51,850
MATT: "I have not traversed this land extensively.
I've been here working along with the heads of the

469
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,809
"city to make sure we are ready for this attack."

470
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:55,809
LAURA: When do you plan to attack?

471
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:58,072
MATT: "A few weeks."

472
00:37:58,072 --> 00:38:03,685
LAURA: You're joining other armies. You don't plan
to fight Thordak on your own?

473
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:11,496
MATT: "Well. There is an attempt to join up with
the remnants of the Fort Daxio force. They have

474
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:17,508
"not gone to Emon themselves and they currently
reside camped out near where Syngorn usually is.

475
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:24,554
"We have a few groups that are set on the other
side of the veil in the prime realm and they are

476
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:29,126
"keeping an eye out for this. A few scouting
parties are in Emon as we speak, trying to gather

477
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:33,784
"intel on Thordak himself. Once we have that
information and we can formulate what to expect,

478
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:35,596
"then we can attack."

479
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:42,280
MARISHA: So you're trying to go after Thordak
himself. That's your first target, Thordak?

480
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:49,882
MATT: "He's currently the largest threat to our
safety, our home, and our return. Don't think this

481
00:38:49,882 --> 00:38:55,636
"is the first time a red dragon of that size has
been felled. There have been ancient ages of

482
00:38:55,636 --> 00:39:02,392
"various deaths from his people. It's not
impossible, but we need to be ready."

483
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:06,477
TRAVIS: Just a heads-up, pro tip: dragons can
fly.

484
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:16,599
(laughter)

485
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,583
MATT: "And I take it you're their leader."

486
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,160
TRAVIS: Of the dragons?

487
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,365
(laughter)

488
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:27,538
MATT: He very slowly sighs while grabbing his
tea.

489
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:33,833
TRAVIS: I've clearly lost your father. It's all
right.

490
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:37,141
LAURA: His intelligence is very low, Grog.

491
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:44,140
TALIESIN: In the interest of dealing with Thordak,
we are going to need access to libraries, any of

492
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:51,194
your people who may know something about this bog,
and accommodations befitting those of us who are

493
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:52,143
titled.

494
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:55,900
SAM: As well as access to certain parts of the
city. We need some items to acquire within the

495
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,532
city before we set out.

496
00:39:57,532 --> 00:40:01,648
MARISHA: Also, it would be nice to find shelter
for those of us who are not titled.

497
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:04,747
SAM: And I had asked for an oolong tea.

498
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:10,607
(laughter)

499
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:14,758
SAM: This is more of an assam, I would say? A
black tea.

500
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:16,738
TALIESIN: This is technically what you do, though,
isn't it?

501
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:18,978
MATT: Devana says, "I'm terribly sorry, I didn't
mean that--"

502
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:21,438
MARISHA: No, not you.

503
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:34,144
MATT: Syldor crosses his fingers together and, "I
can give you a letter that will grant you entry to

504
00:40:34,144 --> 00:40:42,865
"a few of our general storehouses. However, most of
you are outsiders and others have been ostracized

505
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:44,265
"in their own right."

506
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:51,516
TALIESIN: But you will respect titled entry. Those
of us who are court can converse with court.

507
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:58,218
MATT: "Your title, your court, is unfamiliar with
me. I doubt it will hold sway within this town,

508
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:05,173
"this city, this entire realm. But you speak of
great importance, are you the leader of this

509
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:09,827
"troop, he who brings up words of courts and
titles?"

510
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:18,007
TALIESIN: For the moment, why not? I will say, I
know the Feywild by reputation, and by reputation

511
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:25,396
you are known for your manners, and any kingdom
should be measured by manners as the currency that

512
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:27,265
is the easiest to come across.

513
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:34,229
MATT: "Manners, by the way, are extremely
effective in times of peace. This is not one of

514
00:41:34,229 --> 00:41:40,269
"those times. However, I appreciate that you at
least acknowledge the way things sometimes work.

515
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:49,024
"So. Daughter. Son. What else do you need of me?"

516
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:56,107
LIAM: Honestly? Nothing.

517
00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:59,183
LAURA: We don't need or want anything from you.

518
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,989
MATT: "Yet you still came to my home."

519
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:11,014
LAURA: Oh, well. Yeah. We got what we wanted,
which is access to the city.

520
00:42:11,014 --> 00:42:16,016
LIAM: We're not here to be friends or rekindle
anything, but it seems like we want the same

521
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:27,012
thing, in a roundabout way. We want to end these
dragons. We want to return the world to what it

522
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:37,648
once was. Any help you can give in spite of our
past, in spite of all the bullshit between us will

523
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:41,548
be appreciated by more than just she and I.

524
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:52,698
LAURA: We know you have no love for us. Think of
those you do love. And I hug Velora. Don't you

525
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:55,328
want to make her safe?

526
00:42:55,328 --> 00:43:08,088
MATT: "That's exactly what I intend to do. If you
wish to help in that, then so be it. I'll pull

527
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:19,201
"what I can within the city. (sighs) Just leave me
to my business, please." You see for a moment

528
00:43:19,201 --> 00:43:24,736
there, for all the facade, all the front that he
puts up, that strong distance facade, you see the

529
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:39,004
fatigue break through, and there's a, like a dark
heartbreak. "This is a greater threat than we've

530
00:43:39,004 --> 00:43:47,886
"ever faced in our lifetime, and many of those in
this city have lived quite a while. We have to do

531
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:55,703
"things right. Don't be foolish. Too many lives
have been lost at the hands of these dragons, some

532
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:58,320
"closer than others."

533
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,718
LAURA: Do you know of anyone that has traversed
more of the Feywild, that would know of what we

534
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:06,043
might expect?

535
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:17,356
MATT: "One who's seen the most would be the High
Warden. I could probably get you passage to see

536
00:44:17,356 --> 00:44:27,155
"her, but you're going to be <i>heavily</i> guarded."
You guys do know the High Warden, Tyrelda is her

537
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:35,396
name, and she is actually of the bloodline of
Gynlara who founded Syngorn centuries ago. She

538
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:43,066
currently is essentially the de facto leader,
though in terms of public, she is the final

539
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:52,205
decision-maker on most of Syngorn's political and
social endeavors. "Will that suffice?"

540
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:54,928
LIAM: It will.

541
00:44:54,928 --> 00:44:56,510
LAURA: It will.

542
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,065
SAM: Good day.

543
00:44:59,065 --> 00:45:00,098
MARISHA: Good day.

544
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:02,699
(laughter)

545
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:09,360
MATT: "Curious manners, your friends." He takes
his tea and pours another cupful, and leans back

546
00:45:09,436 --> 00:45:13,069
in his chair. "Two dragons you say you've
killed."

547
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:15,445
LIAM: That's right.

548
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:17,553
LAURA: More than that, isn't it?

549
00:45:17,553 --> 00:45:19,474
TRAVIS: Of the Conclave.

550
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:21,273
LAURA: Of the Conclave, we've killed two.

551
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:22,860
MATT: "Which ones?"

552
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:30,811
LAURA: Umbrasyl. And. What was the other one?

553
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,778
LIAM: Blitzen?

554
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:38,923
LAURA: Blitzen, Donner? What was the name of the
other one? Oh, it was General Krieg!

555
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:40,950
MARISHA: Yeah, that one.

556
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,174
LAURA: The blue one.

557
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:43,937
MARISHA: And then we've also killed a white one.

558
00:45:43,937 --> 00:45:46,880
SAM: We thought so little of him we didn't even
remember his name.

559
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,286
(laughter)

560
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,587
LIAM: Brimscythe?

561
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:55,556
MARISHA: Brimscythe. That's the one.

562
00:45:55,556 --> 00:45:58,097
SAM: But also we respect him enough to learn his
name.

563
00:45:58,097 --> 00:46:12,952
MATT: "Well, your story has charm. I have to
admit, I have gotten word of at least one dragon

564
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:15,336
"felled on the other side."

565
00:46:15,336 --> 00:46:23,010
MARISHA: I pull out a dragon's tooth from Umbrasyl
out of my pocket and I toss it to him. That's the

566
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,814
result of the doings of your children. You should
be very proud.

567
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:48,431
MATT: "I am proud. I. Am proud. But the city lives
differently. Understand the difficulty that your

568
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:59,210
"presence puts upon our family with you being here.
I mean no disrespect, and it's fine in this trying

569
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:09,017
"time. But while you two may have undergone much
ridicule in your youth, I saved you from the brunt

570
00:47:09,017 --> 00:47:11,234
"of it."

571
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:22,444
LAURA: You-- headphones, dear-- you fucked some
random woman in a city you passed through, and you

572
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:25,004
expect us to feel sorry for you?

573
00:47:25,004 --> 00:47:28,065
LIAM: You should've left us to be with our mother
when she died!

574
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:36,810
LAURA: Why? Why pull us away from her if you had
no love? We would have been happy with her.

575
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:45,830
MATT: "Because I had hope that you would be worth
more, given that you had my blood in your veins,

576
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:49,065
"than to waste away in some small hovel."

577
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:56,180
LAURA: If I could pull the blood of you from my
veins and give it back, I would.

578
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,616
I want no part of you.

579
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:03,725
MATT: "There are many things we wish for but we
have no choice but to take what we are given and

580
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:17,299
"make the best with what we have. Even with this
rift, there is still a part of me that cares for

581
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:24,908
"you both and is genuinely happy that you live. And
that you rise. And that you prove what the rest of

582
00:48:24,908 --> 00:48:35,907
"these fools in this city said you were incapable
of. Yes, I am prejudiced. But I still fight it

583
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:52,252
"every day. And I'm not going to lie, every time
that my daughter, your half-sister, laughs and

584
00:48:52,252 --> 00:49:06,180
"plays stealthy Vax and Vex on her own, it makes me
smile. You inspire those outside of our city walls

585
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:14,862
"with your doings. I think that's rather large of
you. As foolish and as damned deadly as some of

586
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:31,838
"these endeavors may be, you inspire. That's more
than I've done in my lifetime. So. Care not what I

587
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:42,950
"think. Care not how your mother died. Just avenge
it. For both of us. Show your little sister that

588
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:55,976
"you can rise up and destroy whatever comes in your
way. Hate me all you want. It's only half-scorn

589
00:49:55,976 --> 00:50:06,367
"from me. I live with my regrets. I tried to bring
you up right. But that upbringing was not

590
00:50:06,397 --> 00:50:13,674
"right for you. And by the time I tried to return
you, it was too late.

591
00:50:13,674 --> 00:50:23,065
"I'm sorry. That's all I can say."

592
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:30,056
Devana goes, "Anyone want any more tea? Oolong,
you said."

593
00:50:30,056 --> 00:50:31,277
SAM: You got it!

594
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:34,559
MATT: "Right, yes." And she leaves, awkwardly.

595
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,270
TRAVIS: Just so you know, what they did against
the dragons was incredible. All of the rest of us

596
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:45,698
were like, "Ah! Oh, we're dying! We don't have
anything we can do!" And then they were like

597
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:47,288
"Kill! Stab!" And then--

598
00:50:47,288 --> 00:50:49,338
MARISHA: Percy! No, don't die!

599
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,472
TALIESIN: What are you doing?

600
00:50:50,472 --> 00:50:53,995
MARISHA: I'm being blood out of your jugular, just
go with it.

601
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:58,066
TRAVIS: And then they killed them all! It's the
only reason we're alive, really.

602
00:50:58,066 --> 00:51:04,690
SAM: It's true. Vax wanted to go inside the
dragon, I was like, no! No, let's do it!

603
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:09,173
(laughter)

604
00:51:09,173 --> 00:51:13,702
SAM: Cut his way out, went back and saved me.
Crazy.

605
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:16,981
MATT: "That does indeed sound quite crazy."

606
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:21,054
TRAVIS: I mean, the balls on this one-- this one.

607
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:28,156
MATT: "Let's be honest, Grog. They both have--"

608
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:33,362
TRAVIS: Lord Grog Peanut Butter of Strongjaw. I'm
titled.

609
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:42,700
MATT: "I'd say they've both proven to have more
balls than most of those in our city."

610
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,594
LIAM: Look, we're never going to be a happy
family.

611
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:48,011
MATT: "No. That is right."

612
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:56,099
LIAM: But if you want to make reparations, help us
on our path. It will only help you on yours.

613
00:51:56,146 --> 00:52:02,343
MATT: He stands up from his chair and walks his
way back to his study and

614
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:04,216
closes the door behind him.

615
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:06,973
LAURA: Well, fuck. Guess he's not into us now.

616
00:52:06,973 --> 00:52:08,965
TRAVIS: I thought we weren't getting in a fight!

617
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:10,347
TALIESIN: No, this is good.

618
00:52:10,347 --> 00:52:14,028
SAM: Do you want me to take a dump somewhere?

619
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:15,737
TALIESIN: Not yet.

620
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:18,205
LAURA: Oh, headphones, darling.

621
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:19,382
SAM: Oh, sorry.

622
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:24,749
MATT: She pulls your hand down, looks at you,
says, "Take a dump!"

623
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:27,203
LAURA: Oh, shit. I mean, shoot!

624
00:52:27,203 --> 00:52:30,898
MATT: "I like him."

625
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,790
SAM: That's gnomish. Doesn't mean the same thing.

626
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:38,454
MATT: She's now transfixed on Scanlan.

627
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:43,600
LAURA: Darling, he takes blue sparkly poos!

628
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,920
MATT: "Blue sparkle poos? Can you teach me?"

629
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,680
(laughter)

630
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,816
SAM: Do you have any blueberries?

631
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:57,025
MATT: "I'm going to ask my mom if we've got
blueberries."

632
00:52:57,025 --> 00:52:58,393
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

633
00:52:58,393 --> 00:53:04,729
MATT: She runs off to the kitchen. A few minutes
pass, and Devana comes out holding the tea on the

634
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:08,679
cart and goes, "Who taught my daughter to say
'blue sparkly poo?'"

635
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:12,400
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

636
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,718
MARISHA: Is that a swear word?

637
00:53:14,718 --> 00:53:19,697
LAURA: You should really control the people in
this city from talking about that,

638
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,957
because it's weird.

639
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:22,269
SAM: She got it at preschool.

640
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:23,698
TALIESIN: So many soldiers everywhere.

641
00:53:23,698 --> 00:53:25,480
MATT: "Velora, go to your room."

642
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,512
MARISHA: I've never heard a soldier say, "Ah, blue
sparkly poo!" I feel like she didn't get that from

643
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:31,294
a soldier.

644
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:34,140
TALIESIN: You've never really been in war, have
you?

645
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:39,254
MATT: The door opens from the far study, and you
see Syldor walk back in holding what looks to be a

646
00:53:39,254 --> 00:53:47,805
rolled-up piece of paper with a seal on it. He
heads over and tosses it onto the table. "That

647
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:53,499
"will grant you passage through the city. That will
grant you a single meeting with the High Warden.

648
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:58,166
"That's the most my power can do at this time."

649
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,625
LAURA: This is a belt buckle, why are you passing
me this?

650
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,194
LIAM: (stage-whispering) We're playing pretend.

651
00:54:02,194 --> 00:54:05,914
LAURA: Okay, oh, it's a sealed scroll now.

652
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:14,746
TALIESIN: May I see that really quickly? Don't
throw it! Pretend!

653
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:17,258
MARISHA: Pretend. I'm pretend handing it off.

654
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:18,635
SAM: Ooh, good object work.

655
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:23,933
LIAM: Now get in the canoe!

656
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:28,345
LAURA: Yes, yes.

657
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:30,783
TALIESIN: Right, they're all elves. I can't look
at them.

658
00:54:30,783 --> 00:54:32,735
SAM: Oh, it flew away!

659
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:37,942
TALIESIN: This grants an audience for all of us,
then?

660
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,751
MATT: "Yes."

661
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:44,973
TALIESIN: You're going to have to amend that one
name, though, just to be fair.

662
00:54:44,973 --> 00:54:46,210
It's Lady Vex'ahlia.

663
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,866
MATT: "Lady?"

664
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:51,944
TALIESIN: Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third
House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.

665
00:54:51,944 --> 00:55:08,709
(cheering)

666
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:16,461
TALIESIN: So good sir, despite your relationship
with her, do watch your manners.

667
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:22,565
SAM: Tea spit take!

668
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:25,951
MATT: "My apologies, Lady Vex'ahlia."

669
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,792
LAURA: Well, you didn't know.

670
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:31,153
(laughter)

671
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:40,210
MATT: You can see, there's confused surprise, but
a smile does curl across the corner of his mouth.

672
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:46,750
"I will make the amendment immediately." And he
stands back up, takes it from Percival and makes

673
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,480
his way back to the room.

674
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,210
LIAM: Darth Vader.

675
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:58,889
MATT: He returns, hands you the amended paper.
"Good luck."

676
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,911
LAURA: This is a belt buckle-- oh.

677
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:02,785
(laughter)

678
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:05,669
MATT: It's a gift from your mother.

679
00:56:05,669 --> 00:56:08,476
TRAVIS: You should thank Percy.

680
00:56:08,476 --> 00:56:17,564
MATT: "If you do intend to make your way towards
the Shademirk, be careful. Be safe. And if

681
00:56:17,564 --> 00:56:23,619
"anything comes your way that you feel you are
incapable of handling, run. We don't need heroes

682
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:25,931
"right now, we need survivors."

683
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:36,315
TRAVIS: No promises?

684
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:39,734
MATT: He shoots you a very dark look.

685
00:56:39,734 --> 00:56:47,090
TRAVIS: Right. Sorry. The House of Peanut Butter
will continue its bloodline. I don't know.

686
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:57,872
MATT: "I will send word. Where can I send word to
retrieve you when the time is ready for us to attack?"

687
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,795
SAM: Do we have accommodations in the city?

688
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:02,451
LAURA: Yes, but we'll be in Whitestone.

689
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:08,995
MATT: "I will send word to Whitestone when we plan
to return to the Prime Material, and preparing our

690
00:57:08,995 --> 00:57:11,327
"forces for attack upon Thordak in Emon."

691
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,122
MARISHA: If not, reach out to Allura of Emon.

692
00:57:13,122 --> 00:57:16,594
MATT: "I know Allura well, and I can reach to
her."

693
00:57:16,594 --> 00:57:18,188
MARISHA: I had a feeling you did.

694
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:28,007
(laughter)

695
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:30,866
SAM: Are you hitting on their dad?

696
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:32,709
MATT: "Anyway."

697
00:57:32,709 --> 00:57:35,077
MARISHA: Does everything look like hitting on
people to you, Scanlan?

698
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,500
SAM: It does.

699
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,642
MATT: It's the Scanlan filter. It's on Snapchat.

700
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:43,422
MARISHA: Take off the beer goggles, take them off!
Those are plus-two magical beer goggles.

701
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:44,444
Take them off!

702
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:56,384
MATT: He stands up and at this point Devana enters
beside him, puts her hand on his shoulder. He

703
00:57:56,384 --> 00:58:02,571
looks to you with his hands crossed before him and
goes, "I wish you luck and safe journeys. I

704
00:58:02,571 --> 00:58:06,291
"appreciate you coming by. It was good to see you
both."

705
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:08,337
LIAM: Where did our sister go?

706
00:58:08,337 --> 00:58:14,138
MATT: Turns and Devana goes, "She's in her room
for using bad language."

707
00:58:14,138 --> 00:58:20,582
LAURA: Poo is a really terrible word to say, I
think. Good thing she didn't say any of the other

708
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:22,873
words that she heard in here.

709
00:58:22,873 --> 00:58:27,332
MATT: "Hold on." And she leaves and comes back,
this time pushing Velora from the back, and Velora

710
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:30,737
walks up pouting with her arms crossed, holding
her little owlbear under her arm.

711
00:58:30,737 --> 00:58:32,940
LIAM: Come here.

712
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:37,273
MATT: She runs up and gives you a big hug. "Are
you leaving?"

713
00:58:37,273 --> 00:58:39,066
LIAM: Yeah, just for a little bit, though.

714
00:58:39,066 --> 00:58:40,148
MATT: "You just got here!"

715
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:47,390
LIAM: I know. Listen, do me a favor? Keep scraping
up those knees, will you? You crawl anywhere you

716
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:54,558
want in this city, the higher the better. And
listen to your parents some of the time. But not

717
00:58:54,558 --> 00:58:56,168
all of the time.

718
00:58:56,168 --> 00:58:57,676
MATT: "I can already do that."

719
00:58:57,676 --> 00:58:59,487
LAURA: Oh, and!

720
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:05,196
MATT: She gives you a little kiss on the cheek and
then runs up and puts her arms around you and

721
00:59:05,196 --> 00:59:07,636
almost pushes you back, she's bigger than you
remember.

722
00:59:07,636 --> 00:59:15,301
LAURA: She is. I pull out one of my owlbear
feathers that I picked up with Zahra and I tuck it

723
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,027
behind her ear.

724
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:18,445
MATT: "What's this?"

725
00:59:18,445 --> 00:59:22,399
LAURA: It's an owlbear feather. I know!

726
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:24,704
(laughter)

727
00:59:24,704 --> 00:59:28,463
MATT: She steps back down and looks at her little
plushie and--

728
00:59:28,463 --> 00:59:33,496
LAURA: You keep that behind your ear, and you wear
your necklace, and you never forget that Vex and

729
00:59:33,496 --> 00:59:36,981
Vax love you very, very much, dear.

730
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:43,997
LIAM: Listen to us. You are not our half-sister.
You are our sister.

731
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:54,185
MATT: She runs up and hugs you both, one in each
arm, and then steps back down.

732
00:59:54,185 --> 00:59:57,184
"Thank you. Come back soon, please!"

733
00:59:57,184 --> 01:00:00,677
LAURA: Of course, come visit me in my baroness...
isity.

734
01:00:00,677 --> 01:00:05,040
MATT: She runs back to her mom's side and looks at
her mom and goes, "Poo."

735
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:13,072
(laughter)

736
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:24,519
MATT: Devana rolls her eyes and goes, "Ugh. Thank
you. So much."

737
01:00:24,557 --> 01:00:27,810
LIAM: Shit's a good word, too.

738
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:30,646
MATT: Covers her ears.

739
01:00:30,646 --> 01:00:32,939
TRAVIS: Are we doing that now? Penis wiggle!

740
01:00:32,939 --> 01:00:35,336
(laughter)

741
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:40,085
MATT: You see Devana's looking cornered, it's
like, (shushing noises). Syldor actually starts

742
01:00:40,085 --> 01:00:45,337
laughing. "I hope that's good day, then!"

743
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:46,698
SAM: Good day.

744
01:00:46,698 --> 01:00:47,539
LAURA: Good day.

745
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:48,772
TRAVIS: Bidet.

746
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:50,121
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Good day.

747
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:54,065
MATT: "Good day." And Syldor bows, you all slowly
leave the door, and right before the door closes

748
01:00:54,065 --> 01:00:56,244
behind you hear a little voice go, "Shit."

749
01:00:56,244 --> 01:00:58,430
(laughter)

750
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:05,768
MATT: "No!" The door closes.

751
01:01:05,768 --> 01:01:10,115
MARISHA: We're those terrible-influence side of
the family, aren't we?

752
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,670
LAURA: I run up and I give Percy the biggest hug.
Percival!

753
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,748
TALIESIN: It's the gift of smugness, it never goes
away.

754
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:20,913
LAURA: Wait, is it real-- no. Was it all just
to--

755
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:28,189
TALIESIN: No, I actually, it occurs to me that we
did kill two of the three barons of Whitestone the

756
01:01:28,189 --> 01:01:29,850
last time that we were there.

757
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:39,039
(laughter)

758
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:41,237
TALIESIN: There's no house and there's no money--

759
01:01:41,237 --> 01:01:43,303
MARISHA: It's the one Scanlan burned.

760
01:01:43,303 --> 01:01:44,806
TALIESIN: It's the one that Scanlan burned.

761
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:49,024
SAM: Oh, you're the lady of the house that I
burned down.

762
01:01:49,024 --> 01:01:53,614
TALIESIN: And there's just a crypt and that's
being used for other things, but--

763
01:01:53,614 --> 01:01:55,471
MARISHA: But you have a title!

764
01:01:55,471 --> 01:01:59,592
TALIESIN: But you do have a title, at the very
least. And once a year, you have to do something

765
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:00,574
ridiculous.

766
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:01,824
LAURA: Even so, Percy.

767
01:02:01,824 --> 01:02:02,579
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

768
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:03,595
LAURA: I thank you so much.

769
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,330
TALIESIN: Use it in good health.

770
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:16,131
TRAVIS: I lean over to Scanlan and I say, did you
notice that their dad was saying "bidet" wrong?

771
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:19,704
SAM: I did. I did.

772
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:22,155
TRAVIS: I thought he was like a highfalutin type.

773
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,870
SAM: You should just say it even louder to make
sure people know the correct pronunciation.

774
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:30,804
TRAVIS: I know. We could be a force for good in
and outside of the city. Bidet!

775
01:02:30,804 --> 01:02:32,084
SAM: Bidet!

776
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:39,999
MATT: The guards that are waiting for you outside
of the house just sigh very loudly. (sighs)

777
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:42,379
TRAVIS: Change is hard.

778
01:02:42,379 --> 01:02:50,032
MATT: All right, so you have your parchment.
Within the next half-hour or so it's not difficult for

779
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:55,606
you guys to go ahead and find sleeping
arrangements for the evening within Syngorn.

780
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:59,910
You're met for the most part with standoffishness
and curiosity with your approach, but upon showing

781
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:05,560
the paper there is a sudden realization and a
formality that is brought to the conversation, and

782
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,800
it's, you can't help but enjoy it, the two of you.
You haven't walked through Syngorn and been

783
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,207
forcing people to show you the respect you've
always wanted, and there is something slightly

784
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:23,678
cathartic about that. But you manage to find
accommodations for the evening's rest. The guards

785
01:03:23,678 --> 01:03:31,618
proceed up into the secondary floor where your
room is kept. Will not enter the room, but

786
01:03:31,618 --> 01:03:35,520
notify you that they will be staying outside of
the doorway to ensure that both you are protected

787
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:38,646
and that you don't do anything crazy in the
night.

788
01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:39,667
TRAVIS: What?

789
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:40,692
LAURA: That's stupid.

790
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,728
MARISHA: We're respectable.

791
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:45,614
TALIESIN: It's adorable that they think they could
stop us if we tried.

792
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:49,675
MARISHA: I know! Are we all in rooms next to each
other, are we in one room?

793
01:03:49,675 --> 01:03:56,606
MATT: It's a series of rooms within what looks
like it was at one time a military barracks that

794
01:03:56,606 --> 01:04:02,907
has since been renovated. It's not really an inn
or tavern; there aren't a lot of travelers that

795
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:08,108
come through Syngorn that don't actually live
there or have a home, so it's more being used for

796
01:04:08,108 --> 01:04:13,546
storage, but they cleared out an area and they put
up beds and it looks-- Syngorn storage room is

797
01:04:13,546 --> 01:04:17,986
pretty nice by the standards of like Kymal or
Westruun, so it's not too bad.

798
01:04:17,986 --> 01:04:22,245
TALIESIN: There's some art nouveau happening.
That's all I can really ask.

799
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:24,194
MARISHA: Have they already locked us in our
rooms?

800
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,562
MATT: No, you've just gotten to your rooms now,
so.

801
01:04:27,562 --> 01:04:31,403
TRAVIS: We're a very religious group and we like
to have a family prayer.

802
01:04:31,403 --> 01:04:35,747
LAURA: Speaking of, wait. Where the fuck is Pike?

803
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,256
SAM: Oh shit.

804
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:43,565
MARISHA: She was right behind us!

805
01:04:43,565 --> 01:04:51,869
MATT: You all, you all realize in the chaos and
the tension of meeting your father--

806
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:53,404
LIAM: Must've gotten lost!

807
01:04:53,404 --> 01:04:55,938
TRAVIS: No, she's here.

808
01:04:55,938 --> 01:05:02,495
MATT: You catch a sudden flicker of divine energy
in the space of the hallway near you. The guards

809
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:11,051
step back, looking a bit freaked out and grabbing
their weaponry, and you see a burst of Pike's face

810
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:17,909
coming through, her divine form, and she says,
"I'm sorry--" (static) Disappears, comes back.

811
01:05:17,909 --> 01:05:26,432
"The walls--can't maintain--" And her form
vanishes once again.

812
01:05:26,432 --> 01:05:27,709
TRAVIS: Fucking Verizon.

813
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:31,568
(laughter)

814
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:36,355
LAURA: Great, now we'll never have them as a
sponsor. Thank you, Travis.

815
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,988
LIAM: Go T-Mobile.

816
01:05:38,988 --> 01:05:42,178
MATT: Go AT-- No.

817
01:05:42,178 --> 01:05:51,719
MARISHA: So can we have like a little family
pow-wow in maybe one of the rooms before we all

818
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:57,806
tuck in for the night and you put the masking tape
over each of our doors so we don't sneak into each

819
01:05:57,806 --> 01:06:00,923
other's rooms. High school field trip, yeah?

820
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:04,116
SAM: I don't know any of those words.

821
01:06:04,116 --> 01:06:07,421
MATT: "Do as you wish, we'll be here if you need
us."

822
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,180
TRAVIS: Do you need anything, drinks?

823
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,743
SAM: We need to talk to the little fucker.

824
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:20,001
TRAVIS: Then-- oh, what? Oh, yeah! Well, let's all
head inside for prayer.

825
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,452
LAURA: Actually--

826
01:06:21,452 --> 01:06:23,859
TALIESIN: We'll need food and drink.

827
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:30,105
LAURA: Guard! One of you, could you go get us some
food? We're very hungry.

828
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:33,295
MARISHA: And wine? Maybe some wine?

829
01:06:33,338 --> 01:06:38,731
LAURA: As a baroness, I'm very used to getting
food when I want it.

830
01:06:38,731 --> 01:06:45,567
MATT: One of the guards steps forward and says,
"Let me see that parchment once more, please?"

831
01:06:45,567 --> 01:06:47,352
TRAVIS: That's not it.

832
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:49,344
MATT: That's a belt buckle.

833
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:54,828
(laughter)

834
01:06:54,828 --> 01:06:57,395
LIAM: My belt buckle!

835
01:06:57,395 --> 01:07:05,220
MATT: Rolls it back up, hands it back. "I will
retrieve your necessary meal, drink, and other

836
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,955
"requests you may have."

837
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:08,458
LIAM: Chicken, please.

838
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,684
LAURA: Thank you. I want anything but chicken.

839
01:07:10,684 --> 01:07:16,567
MATT: "Noted and noted." And he turns around and
leaves the three other guards standing outside of

840
01:07:16,567 --> 01:07:19,870
your rooms to do about as you please.

841
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:23,076
SAM: Right, so we pick the biggest room and we all
enter it.

842
01:07:23,076 --> 01:07:29,284
MATT: It's a two-bedroom, opposite sides, and
there is a window that has a beautiful view of the

843
01:07:29,284 --> 01:07:34,835
central lake that sits at the center of Syngorn,
the entire city's built around, before it meets

844
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:37,371
the base of the mountain range that it's
buttressed against.

845
01:07:37,371 --> 01:07:38,667
SAM: Titicaca.

846
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:43,597
MATT: That sounds Elvish, but it's not.

847
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:47,009
SAM: No, I just like saying that.

848
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:49,165
MATT: Door closes behind you guys.

849
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,180
TRAVIS: Gormidi?

850
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:59,992
MATT: There's a little flash, a sparkle of arcane
light as the satyr form goes, (breathes heavily)

851
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:02,808
"That was a little harrowing. You didn't tell me
you were going to bring me into the belly of the

852
01:08:02,808 --> 01:08:06,702
"beast so soon, we didn't even talk about-- that
was really good tea, by the way;

853
01:08:06,702 --> 01:08:08,259
"that was quite delicious."

854
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:10,209
TALIESIN: You were drinking our tea?

855
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:12,250
MATT: "Very quietly."

856
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,379
MARISHA: I was wondering where my tea went.

857
01:08:14,379 --> 01:08:18,248
TRAVIS: Now, hold on. Did you steal anything while
you were in there?

858
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:19,485
MATT: "No!"

859
01:08:19,485 --> 01:08:20,956
MARISHA: Garmelie...

860
01:08:20,956 --> 01:08:23,366
MATT: "No!"

861
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,797
SAM: Insight-check him.

862
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:27,340
TRAVIS: Insight-check that bitch!

863
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,063
SAM: Natural one.

864
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:33,551
(laughter)

865
01:08:33,551 --> 01:08:36,931
MATT: He is about as hard to read as anyone you've
come across in the Feywild.

866
01:08:36,931 --> 01:08:38,054
MARISHA: Can I try?

867
01:08:38,054 --> 01:08:39,120
MATT: Sure.

868
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,538
LAURA: I feel like we don't need an insight check
to know he was lying.

869
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:48,835
MARISHA: Oh, I got a 17. I'm way more better than
Scanlan. Natural insight. 28.

870
01:08:48,835 --> 01:08:54,250
MATT: 28. Through his teeth.

871
01:08:54,250 --> 01:09:04,551
MARISHA: I do a little entangling underneath of
him and start checking his pockets, TSA style.

872
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:06,578
Start giving him the frisk.

873
01:09:06,578 --> 01:09:09,823
MATT: These vines wrap up around his legs and he's
like, "Oh, I was just!"

874
01:09:09,823 --> 01:09:11,972
MARISHA: Into the pockets.

875
01:09:11,972 --> 01:09:13,678
TRAVIS: Just let it happen.

876
01:09:13,678 --> 01:09:15,576
LAURA: Where are the pockets?

877
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:16,557
MATT: In his vest.

878
01:09:16,557 --> 01:09:17,969
MARISHA: In his vest pockets.

879
01:09:17,969 --> 01:09:22,936
TALIESIN: There better not be an owlbear in there
or I'm going to be very upset.

880
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:27,670
MATT: No, you reach into one pocket, it's empty.
You reach into the other, and your arm goes quite

881
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,826
far into the pocket, farther than it should--

882
01:09:29,826 --> 01:09:31,497
MARISHA: You little devil.

883
01:09:31,497 --> 01:09:39,973
MATT: "What? This is extremely degrading! We had a
deal." It's empty.

884
01:09:39,973 --> 01:09:51,283
MARISHA: Is this a pocket of holding? I think
about the fancy silverware that I might've seen in

885
01:09:51,283 --> 01:09:53,249
Syldor's house.

886
01:09:53,249 --> 01:09:55,920
MATT: Nothing. Just an empty space.

887
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,180
TRAVIS: Come on, keep going.

888
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:01,010
MARISHA: I think of fancy teacups, because he
mentioned drinking tea.

889
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:03,120
MATT: (melodically) Nothing!

890
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,869
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

891
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:06,710
TRAVIS: You've never stolen anything, shit!

892
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,727
LAURA: Think of gold. Think of gold, Keyleth.

893
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:10,030
TALIESIN: I cast Friends.

894
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:12,769
MARISHA: I think of gold? Oh, I think of gold.
Sorry, I'm not materialistic.

895
01:10:12,769 --> 01:10:16,382
TALIESIN: We're going to have to have a working
relationship.

896
01:10:16,382 --> 01:10:18,456
LAURA: Why do you say that like it was a bad
thing?

897
01:10:18,456 --> 01:10:22,319
MARISHA: I mean, I'm not. I'm a Barbie girl in a
Barbie world.

898
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,721
(laughter)

899
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,483
MATT: He smacks the side of your arm and is like,
"Get your hand out of my pocket!"

900
01:10:27,483 --> 01:10:28,732
MARISHA: Ow!

901
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:31,350
LIAM: Keyleth. Check the fur.

902
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:33,184
LAURA: No, don't check the fur.

903
01:10:33,184 --> 01:10:35,679
MATT: "Excuse me?!"

904
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,687
TALIESIN: Let's give him a chance to 'fess up.

905
01:10:39,687 --> 01:10:47,762
MATT: "This is not why we're here to talk. We are
here to discuss the elements of our agreement. Two

906
01:10:47,762 --> 01:10:53,731
"things I require your aid in taking, and then I
show you to the outskirts of the Shademirk."

907
01:10:53,731 --> 01:10:57,733
LAURA: I feel like now we already know where the
outskirts of the Shademirk are.

908
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:00,630
MATT: "But do you know of the dangers that are on
your way?"

909
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,144
SAM: Yeah, you told us about all three dangers
that we have to face.

910
01:11:03,144 --> 01:11:05,310
MARISHA: That's true. I have them written down.

911
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:09,381
(laughter)

912
01:11:09,381 --> 01:11:13,602
MARISHA: The Hut of Wodenna, the Last Camp of
Sorudun the Happy, and the theatre.

913
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:22,390
MATT: "And you think those are all the dangers?!
There are so many! It's a dangerous place!

914
01:11:22,453 --> 01:11:25,769
"Stop touching me!"

915
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:28,296
TRAVIS: All right, hands off him.

916
01:11:28,296 --> 01:11:31,165
SAM: Just tell us what the two things are we that
we need to steal.

917
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:37,350
MATT: "All right. I require a piece of a threshold
crest."

918
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:38,953
LAURA: What the fuck is that?

919
01:11:38,953 --> 01:11:40,327
MARISHA: Of a threshold crest?

920
01:11:40,327 --> 01:11:42,466
LIAM: Giant stones on the outside of the city.

921
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:46,914
MATT: "Threshold crest." Which you recall are the
blue stones that are in the wall around the city.

922
01:11:46,914 --> 01:11:48,336
LAURA: That's the stupidest thing.

923
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,214
MARISHA: Oh no!

924
01:11:50,214 --> 01:11:51,820
MATT: "Why is that stupid?"

925
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:53,713
LAURA: Because then they can't go back!

926
01:11:53,713 --> 01:11:57,010
MATT: "You don't have to get it from the wall. I'm
sure they build it from something and there might

927
01:11:57,056 --> 01:11:58,485
"be a reserve somewhere."

928
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:03,465
MARISHA: Right, in the other dimension that they
came from. You realize Syngorn didn't originate

929
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:04,841
here in the Feywild, right?

930
01:12:04,841 --> 01:12:06,512
MATT: "I understand, but just..."

931
01:12:06,512 --> 01:12:09,593
MARISHA: Oh, lord have-- oh, sweet Sarenrae.

932
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:13,749
TALIESIN: Wait, okay, a threshold-- a piece?

933
01:12:13,749 --> 01:12:17,701
MATT: "A piece of a threshold crest. Just but a
sliver."

934
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:21,199
LIAM: The same material?

935
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:27,050
MATT: "The same material enchanted that is
functionally able to be

936
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,971
"utilized in the same fashion."

937
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:30,408
TRAVIS: No problem. What else?

938
01:12:30,408 --> 01:12:37,570
MATT: "Great. I also want the High Warden
Tyrelda's hat."

939
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:39,446
TRAVIS: Her hat?

940
01:12:39,446 --> 01:12:44,063
LAURA: Do we know what her hat looks like?

941
01:12:44,063 --> 01:12:45,298
MATT: You do, actually.

942
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:46,417
LAURA: What does it look like?

943
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:50,261
MATT: It's a pointed, small tricorn made of green
velvet that she wears when she goes on like

944
01:12:50,261 --> 01:12:52,151
excursions outside of the city.

945
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:55,005
MARISHA: Oh my god, she's got a pirate tri-corner
hat?

946
01:12:55,005 --> 01:13:00,808
MATT: It's small and very long. Imagine a pirate
hat with a little more of an

947
01:13:00,808 --> 01:13:01,951
elven sleekness to it.

948
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,691
LAURA: Wait, like a Robin Hood hat? Like Peter
Pan!

949
01:13:04,691 --> 01:13:05,881
MARISHA: Oh my god, like Peter Pan!

950
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,762
MATT: Sure, yeah!

951
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:15,116
LIAM: I wasn't looking forward to this moment, but
that actually sounds like fun.

952
01:13:15,164 --> 01:13:19,217
LAURA: That's it, that's all you need?

953
01:13:19,217 --> 01:13:22,780
MATT: "That's all! And I will fulfill my side of
the deal."

954
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:27,995
MARISHA: I have a vague idea of why you might want
a piece of the threshold crest, but why would you

955
01:13:27,995 --> 01:13:30,198
want the High Warden's hat?

956
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:32,355
MATT: "Because I have my reasons."

957
01:13:32,355 --> 01:13:38,137
TALIESIN: So. Are you going to give us what you
stole now? We have an arrangement.

958
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:40,032
MATT: "We do have an arrangement."

959
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:44,274
TALIESIN: It's only fair. Come on.

960
01:13:44,274 --> 01:13:54,952
MATT: Reaches into his pocket and pulls out what
looks to be a very finely sculpted bronze statue

961
01:13:54,952 --> 01:14:03,964
of Syldor that was gifted for essentially his work
with Emon and establishing better trade routes

962
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:10,766
between that city and this city. It's basically a
good job, salesman of the year award of Syldor's.

963
01:14:10,766 --> 01:14:12,115
MARISHA: They stole his Emmy?

964
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,138
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

965
01:14:13,138 --> 01:14:15,190
LAURA: No, it's like they stole his gold watch.

966
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:20,932
LIAM: I yoink it out of his hand. I'll take that.
I got it right here.

967
01:14:20,932 --> 01:14:22,546
SAM: It's a belt buckle.

968
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:23,940
LIAM: Right on my belt.

969
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:30,222
TRAVIS: So weird, you pickpocketed the thing that
wasn't even expensive.

970
01:14:30,354 --> 01:14:31,842
LAURA: Why did you take that?

971
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,751
SAM: He can't help it, he's a klepto.

972
01:14:33,751 --> 01:14:36,576
MATT: "No! It was there and nobody was looking."

973
01:14:36,576 --> 01:14:41,276
MARISHA: Because it ultimately doesn't matter. You
know how awards work. Come on.

974
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:47,678
MATT: "Regardless, we have business to tend to.
Come, we have a hat to catch!"

975
01:14:47,678 --> 01:14:51,433
LIAM: Oh, you want to come along?

976
01:14:51,433 --> 01:15:03,855
MARISHA: Oh, hang on, before we all leave. Vex and
Vax, what did your dad do back in the day? Because

977
01:15:03,855 --> 01:15:07,195
he knows Allura and he talked about knowing
Thordak.

978
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:09,207
LAURA: He's an ambassador to the city.

979
01:15:09,207 --> 01:15:11,934
MARISHA: Does he have any type of fighting
capabilities?

980
01:15:11,934 --> 01:15:14,996
LAURA: Ugh. If he does, we never saw it.

981
01:15:14,996 --> 01:15:17,194
LIAM: Yeah, he'll bore you to death.

982
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:19,676
LAURA: Yeah, he can talk a lot.

983
01:15:19,676 --> 01:15:26,924
MARISHA: Because it sounds like he was a part of
the mission to lock in Thordak

984
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:28,930
11 or so years ago.

985
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,636
LAURA: What? No way.

986
01:15:31,636 --> 01:15:35,790
MARISHA: He mentioned that he's been down this
road before.

987
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,762
LAURA: He knows Allura because he knew the Council
members.

988
01:15:39,762 --> 01:15:41,937
He was the one that sent us off to find...

989
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:48,590
LIAM: He's a traveling salesman that sells
politics. He's not anything all that fancy.

990
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:56,970
MARISHA: Well, if he sells politics, there could
be a lot in selling war against a dragon. I'm not

991
01:15:56,970 --> 01:16:02,376
trying to be a dick, but your father was kind of a
dick so I'm just questioning it.

992
01:16:02,376 --> 01:16:04,837
LAURA: No, he's an asshole. That's totally fine.

993
01:16:04,837 --> 01:16:06,484
MARISHA: I'm not trying to talk shit about your
family.

994
01:16:06,484 --> 01:16:07,845
LAURA: No, feel free.

995
01:16:07,845 --> 01:16:09,066
MARISHA: Okay.

996
01:16:09,066 --> 01:16:13,687
TRAVIS: Y'all should totally fight right now. Just
fight in the room while we're all here and take

997
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:14,828
off your clothes.

998
01:16:14,828 --> 01:16:16,523
MARISHA: I'm just saying.

999
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:19,444
TRAVIS: Only way to solve it.

1000
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:20,947
LAURA: Totally, totally.

1001
01:16:20,947 --> 01:16:21,889
TRAVIS: Yep.

1002
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:24,314
TALIESIN: No, that's a very dark and disturbing
thought. I'm very impressed.

1003
01:16:24,314 --> 01:16:26,390
MARISHA: Thank you! I've been learning from you.

1004
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:28,678
TALIESIN: Thank you. Now I feel guilty.

1005
01:16:28,678 --> 01:16:34,817
MARISHA: I don't mean to question to him, he just
said a few things that raised a few hairs on the

1006
01:16:34,817 --> 01:16:36,043
back of my spine.

1007
01:16:36,043 --> 01:16:39,877
LAURA: Well, maybe we can ask him about it?

1008
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:41,865
TRAVIS: You have hair on your spine?

1009
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:51,069
MARISHA: About this time I use Alter Self to go a
little half-Minxie and get those-- like when a dog

1010
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:54,419
is pissed off and it puffs up the hair, towards
Grog.

1011
01:16:54,419 --> 01:16:59,193
MATT: She shows you this emerging patch of fur
that is like, shh, pushing out the back of her

1012
01:16:59,193 --> 01:17:00,176
shoulders.

1013
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:01,338
LAURA: That's real sexy.

1014
01:17:01,338 --> 01:17:02,461
TRAVIS: Pretty sweet.

1015
01:17:02,461 --> 01:17:03,670
LAURA: Pretty hot.

1016
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:11,002
TALIESIN: It is a very fair point, although I
would say I think it would be best to talk to

1017
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:17,637
Allura about your father rather than talk to him
again, I think he's possibly had enough of us for

1018
01:17:17,637 --> 01:17:18,776
a while.

1019
01:17:18,776 --> 01:17:25,032
TRAVIS: So we have the meeting, we go get the
tricorn hat from her, like, boudoir and then we go get

1020
01:17:25,104 --> 01:17:27,133
the crest on the way out, right?

1021
01:17:27,133 --> 01:17:31,815
SAM: Maybe we can even find a clue about where
this crest thing is from the meeting.

1022
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:37,141
MATT: "Grand! That's a great idea! That's a great
idea."

1023
01:17:37,141 --> 01:17:39,642
LAURA: Should we sleep before the meeting?

1024
01:17:39,642 --> 01:17:41,961
TALIESIN: I think the meeting is actually
tomorrow.

1025
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,251
LAURA: Yes.

1026
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:49,537
SAM: It just says we get one meeting, I don't
think it's been "sheduled" yet. Should we go

1027
01:17:49,537 --> 01:17:50,825
"shedule" it?

1028
01:17:50,825 --> 01:17:53,321
LAURA: Let's "shedule" the meeting.

1029
01:17:53,321 --> 01:17:57,348
TRAVIS: Or maybe we could send one of the shitty
guards to go "shedule" it for us.

1030
01:17:57,348 --> 01:18:02,966
LAURA: Is he back from getting us food? Oh no, I
hope he's not, because I want to send a second one

1031
01:18:02,966 --> 01:18:04,304
out there.

1032
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,035
SAM: Ooh! Because you're a lady.

1033
01:18:06,035 --> 01:18:07,479
LAURA: Because I'm a baroness.

1034
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:09,241
TRAVIS: I don't think they're going to leave us
all alone.

1035
01:18:09,241 --> 01:18:10,889
TALIESIN: I have made such a terrible mistake.

1036
01:18:10,889 --> 01:18:14,676
(laughter)

1037
01:18:14,676 --> 01:18:19,870
MATT: You go and check, you check the hallway, and
the guard hasn't returned and the three suddenly

1038
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,498
spin around as the door opens.

1039
01:18:21,498 --> 01:18:26,637
LAURA: Hello! We require a meeting with the High
Warden.

1040
01:18:26,637 --> 01:18:31,762
MARISHA: I do a little gust cantrip from behind
the door to make her hair blow in the wind.

1041
01:18:31,762 --> 01:18:48,407
(laughter)

1042
01:18:48,407 --> 01:18:55,409
MATT: "I need to take this with me. To make the
meeting schedulable."

1043
01:18:55,409 --> 01:18:57,264
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1044
01:18:57,264 --> 01:18:58,448
LAURA: "Shedulable."

1045
01:18:58,448 --> 01:19:00,385
MATT: "Shedulable."

1046
01:19:00,385 --> 01:19:01,605
TRAVIS: Bidet!

1047
01:19:01,605 --> 01:19:06,955
SAM: When would we like the meeting? Tonight or
tomorrow?

1048
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,556
LAURA and LIAM: Tomorrow.

1049
01:19:08,556 --> 01:19:11,445
MATT: You guys did wake up about four hours ago?

1050
01:19:11,445 --> 01:19:12,626
LIAM: Did we?

1051
01:19:12,626 --> 01:19:14,194
SAM: Today! Later today.

1052
01:19:14,194 --> 01:19:15,395
TALIESIN: We'll take the meeting today.

1053
01:19:15,395 --> 01:19:16,895
SAM: Right after siesta.

1054
01:19:16,895 --> 01:19:19,202
LIAM: It's like northern Alaska.

1055
01:19:19,202 --> 01:19:29,041
MATT: "Very well. I'll return." He turns around
and leaves and the two guards look at each other

1056
01:19:29,041 --> 01:19:34,344
like, thank god it wasn't us. They both stand at
the ready as he goes.

1057
01:19:34,344 --> 01:19:39,970
TALIESIN: Let that be a lesson to the two of you
about making fun of a foreigner's accent. I'm

1058
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,496
watching you.

1059
01:19:41,496 --> 01:19:43,577
MATT: As the door slowly closes.

1060
01:19:43,577 --> 01:19:45,122
TALIESIN: Schedulable!

1061
01:19:45,122 --> 01:19:51,559
MATT: The faun, of which is currently-- Garmelie
is up on one of the beds right now, stretched out.

1062
01:19:51,665 --> 01:19:55,578
"So! What are you waiting for?"

1063
01:19:55,578 --> 01:19:57,018
LAURA: That's your bed, Keyleth.

1064
01:19:57,018 --> 01:19:58,397
MARISHA: Aw, man.

1065
01:19:58,397 --> 01:20:01,289
LAURA: Yeah.

1066
01:20:01,289 --> 01:20:03,092
MATT: Brings up one leg.

1067
01:20:03,092 --> 01:20:06,306
LAURA: Trinket jumps up on the bed and snuggles in
with him.

1068
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:09,202
MATT: "No, don't, ugh!" (bear noises)

1069
01:20:09,202 --> 01:20:10,812
MARISHA: Aw, they're shedding on it!

1070
01:20:10,812 --> 01:20:15,974
MATT: (creak, crash) The bottom cracks and the bed
actually falls flat on the ground. The springs

1071
01:20:15,974 --> 01:20:17,101
destroyed.

1072
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:19,334
TALIESIN: It's all right, it's a futon now. It's
like college.

1073
01:20:19,334 --> 01:20:24,796
TRAVIS: Have we seen any of these threshold crests
on our way in?

1074
01:20:24,796 --> 01:20:26,408
LIAM: Yeah, we walked past some.

1075
01:20:26,408 --> 01:20:29,908
MARISHA: They're those little blue stones that are
keeping the city here.

1076
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,598
TRAVIS: Don't say it like it's obvious. I don't
pay attention to shit.

1077
01:20:32,598 --> 01:20:35,037
LAURA: But we just need a sliver of one.

1078
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:40,158
TRAVIS: Right, so like, I could take Vax's head
and smash it against one and then pick up the

1079
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:43,502
pieces. No, that's a bad thing from your frown.

1080
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:50,815
MARISHA: Although Grog doesn't have the worst
idea. And I don't mean smashing Vax's head. That's

1081
01:20:50,815 --> 01:20:58,809
not what I mean. But don't we have some hidden
gems, because I'm really terrified if we start

1082
01:20:58,809 --> 01:21:02,142
hacking away at these stones what might happen.

1083
01:21:02,142 --> 01:21:04,113
LAURA: They might not be able to return.

1084
01:21:04,113 --> 01:21:06,094
MARISHA: So maybe we can do something kind of
fakey.

1085
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,310
SAM: He's in the room.

1086
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:10,391
(laughter)

1087
01:21:10,391 --> 01:21:12,181
MARISHA: Is he asleep? He's asleep, right?

1088
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:14,323
MATT: No, he's currently partially crushed by
Trinket on the bed and goes like,

1089
01:21:14,323 --> 01:21:16,476
"I can hear you!"

1090
01:21:16,476 --> 01:21:23,485
TRAVIS: I mean, we have jewels and shit, just
stuff hanging around, but what does that do?

1091
01:21:23,485 --> 01:21:26,546
SAM: No, how do we know if we can chip
a piece off without ruining it?

1092
01:21:26,546 --> 01:21:28,036
LAURA: I wouldn't risk it.

1093
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:31,701
LIAM: I think we should talk to some people and
ask a couple of questions around town first.

1094
01:21:31,701 --> 01:21:36,358
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe somebody, maybe the High Warden
knows. Maybe we can sneak it out of there or

1095
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:37,227
something.

1096
01:21:37,227 --> 01:21:38,223
LIAM: Just drop it in passing.

1097
01:21:38,223 --> 01:21:40,715
TRAVIS: Ooh! Like a souvenir. "Can we have a piece
of your threshold crest?"

1098
01:21:40,715 --> 01:21:43,330
LAURA: Exactly like that, Grog, exactly like
that.

1099
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,979
TRAVIS: Shit, I have got all the good ideas
today.

1100
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:48,471
(laughter)

1101
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:58,116
TRAVIS: I'm the leader. So what do we do until the
guard comes back?

1102
01:21:58,116 --> 01:22:03,139
MATT: The door opens, the guard comes around with
food and hands it out to the rest of--

1103
01:22:03,139 --> 01:22:06,095
LAURA: Does anybody have money for a tip? Because
I think you're supposed to tip them.

1104
01:22:06,095 --> 01:22:07,302
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1105
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:14,985
MATT: "You're not supposed to tip your guards."
(boof) Slams the door behind.

1106
01:22:14,985 --> 01:22:19,519
MARISHA: That's an Emon tradition. We're overseas,
remember.

1107
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:22,833
TALIESIN: I like it here.

1108
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:25,880
MATT: All right. You finish your meal.

1109
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,223
LAURA: It's delicious!

1110
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:33,507
MATT: And prepare yourselves for an excursion into
the city of Syngorn to seemingly steal a piece of

1111
01:22:33,507 --> 01:22:37,031
the threshold crest and the High Warden Tyrelda's
travel hat.

1112
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:43,802
MARISHA: I turn into Minxie and resign to the idea
that I'm going to be sleeping with Garmelie and

1113
01:22:43,802 --> 01:22:47,728
Trinket and just cuddle next to them in Minxie
mode.

1114
01:22:47,728 --> 01:22:49,668
LAURA: Are you coming with us, though, Keyleth?

1115
01:22:49,668 --> 01:22:51,013
MARISHA: Oh, we're not sleeping?

1116
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:56,094
SAM: No. It's like one in the afternoon, so we'll
probably just go.

1117
01:22:56,094 --> 01:22:58,030
LIAM: But you know, blow a couple more spells.

1118
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:01,049
MATT: So that's one use of your beast form.

1119
01:23:01,049 --> 01:23:05,705
LAURA: Just come on, then.

1120
01:23:05,705 --> 01:23:07,156
MARISHA: I'll come on.

1121
01:23:07,156 --> 01:23:09,769
LIAM: Just save it. You can stay like that, just
walk close to me.

1122
01:23:09,769 --> 01:23:12,542
MARISHA: Am I going to freak people out if I walk
around like this?

1123
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:13,646
TALIESIN: God, I hope so.

1124
01:23:13,646 --> 01:23:15,365
LAURA: Fuck them, that's what I say.

1125
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:21,331
MATT: All right. You guys make your way outside
into the city streets of Syngorn to hopefully wait

1126
01:23:21,331 --> 01:23:26,876
for the other guard, who returns about ten minutes
later to tell you, "It has been 'sheduled.'"

1127
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,567
TRAVIS: Ah, very good.

1128
01:23:28,567 --> 01:23:34,417
MATT: "As soon as you wish, attend to the central
palace and there you will be greeted."

1129
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:35,672
LAURA: Okay.

1130
01:23:35,672 --> 01:23:36,753
TRAVIS: Yep.

1131
01:23:36,753 --> 01:23:38,928
MATT: "Are you leaving now?"

1132
01:23:38,928 --> 01:23:39,892
SAM: Yes.

1133
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:41,767
TRAVIS: Well, we waste no time.

1134
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:46,020
MATT: Makes a big whistle and the other guards
come down, and collectively you now have four

1135
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,537
guards watching you guys.

1136
01:23:47,537 --> 01:23:48,606
TRAVIS: Four?

1137
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,225
LAURA: Yeah. There were four of them.

1138
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:54,689
MARISHA: I drop Minxie form, because that seems
very aggressive.

1139
01:23:54,689 --> 01:24:04,937
SAM: As we walk I say to Vax: Oi, Vax. What is the
reason for this meeting? When we get in there,

1140
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:06,635
what do we say to her?

1141
01:24:06,635 --> 01:24:08,479
MARISHA: Can we have your hat?

1142
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:15,604
LIAM: I don't think we should lead with that.
Maybe work our way around to it. Well, I would

1143
01:24:15,604 --> 01:24:21,918
like advice other than this little hairy man for
how to get to the bog.

1144
01:24:21,918 --> 01:24:23,839
LAURA: And also what we might face.

1145
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,170
LIAM: Yes.

1146
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,530
LAURA: And how we can fight what we might face.

1147
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:29,673
MARISHA: She might know about Fenthras and the
bow.

1148
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:30,770
LAURA: Yes, exactly.

1149
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:35,520
TRAVIS: Wait, Scanlan, can't you go invisible too?
What if you two little buggers just went off and

1150
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,259
like found it on your own while we were
distracting Captain Fancy Hat.

1151
01:24:39,259 --> 01:24:43,185
SAM: Find Fenthras on our own, what?

1152
01:24:43,185 --> 01:24:47,372
TRAVIS: Yeah, you go invisible along with Fauny
Tim over here and you just

1153
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:48,856
go find the fucking hat.

1154
01:24:48,856 --> 01:24:49,808
SAM: Oh, the hat.

1155
01:24:49,808 --> 01:24:51,078
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1156
01:24:51,078 --> 01:24:54,339
MARISHA: What if she's wearing the hat? What if
the hat is on her head?

1157
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,611
TRAVIS: We kill everybody.

1158
01:24:56,611 --> 01:25:02,126
(laughter)

1159
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:04,302
TALIESIN: To be fair, that usually is the plan.

1160
01:25:04,302 --> 01:25:10,249
MATT: And thus ended the story of Vox Machina,
murdered terribly in the streets of Syngorn by

1161
01:25:10,249 --> 01:25:11,502
their own people.

1162
01:25:11,502 --> 01:25:12,871
TALIESIN: Clutching a hat.

1163
01:25:12,871 --> 01:25:14,224
TRAVIS: Tarantino film.

1164
01:25:14,224 --> 01:25:18,206
MATT: As you guys make your way towards the
palace, formulating your plan, we're going to go

1165
01:25:18,206 --> 01:25:23,646
ahead and take a quick bathroom break here. Guys,
about ten, 15 minutes or so, we'll be back here in

1166
01:25:23,646 --> 01:25:29,233
just a little bit. So use your restrooms, stretch
your legs and come back. We'll see you all here in

1167
01:25:29,233 --> 01:25:30,427
a few minutes.

1168
01:25:30,427 --> 01:25:32,444
[no audio]

1169
01:25:32,444 --> 01:25:45,239
(cheering)

1170
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:55,074
MATT: That's a lot of people. Welcome back. First
off, I want to say a big thanks to Amanda Mclean

1171
01:25:55,074 --> 01:25:58,983
for making our awesome graphic for our
intermission, thank you Amanda, appreciate that.

1172
01:25:58,983 --> 01:26:02,444
(cheering)

1173
01:26:02,444 --> 01:26:09,038
MATT: We are back. Brought to you by Loot Crate.
Let's dive back in, as you guys make your way

1174
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:16,096
through the city of Syngorn towards the palace to
what would be the northern side of the city.

1175
01:26:16,096 --> 01:26:22,240
Eventually you come upon the large, slightly
swirling stairs that lead to the front of the

1176
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:28,627
large brass and ivory surrounded doorway that
leads to the interior. You guys have not actually

1177
01:26:28,627 --> 01:26:32,941
been inside this palace before; you've only seen it from a
distance, as your father would not let you in too

1178
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:40,047
close to the center of the city. As you make your
way up the stairs, you can see guards, the Verdant

1179
01:26:40,047 --> 01:26:44,380
Guards step out in an aggressive and defensive
way, but the guards to your sides immediately put

1180
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:50,013
their hands up and signal them to put their arms
down and to stand at ease. You guys are brought to

1181
01:26:50,013 --> 01:26:58,574
the front, the doors open, and a small elderly
elvish gentleman comes out, his long white hair

1182
01:26:58,574 --> 01:27:05,162
almost touching the ground as he shuffles up. He
brings a small monocle up to the side of his face.

1183
01:27:05,162 --> 01:27:12,237
"Yes? Do you have business in the palace?"

1184
01:27:12,237 --> 01:27:13,704
LIAM: G'day mate.

1185
01:27:13,704 --> 01:27:15,089
MARISHA: Good day.

1186
01:27:15,089 --> 01:27:19,882
LAURA: We do. We have a meeting with the High
Warden Tyrelda.

1187
01:27:19,882 --> 01:27:30,599
MATT: "Let me see your papers. Oh, I see they're
right here. Very well. Follow me, please." He

1188
01:27:30,599 --> 01:27:37,159
turns around and walks his way into the building.
You all follow suit and are led through the main

1189
01:27:37,159 --> 01:27:43,098
entryway to the palace itself. On the inside you
can see these giant archways that the pillars that

1190
01:27:43,098 --> 01:27:48,531
hold them up look like trees that spread to the
top like the stone boughs actually hold a canopy

1191
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:58,373
made of marble with beautiful portraits and long
artistic renditions of the creation of Syngorn,

1192
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:03,479
the people, each bloodline that has progressed and
taken on the central political structure of the

1193
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:11,011
city. As it goes, you can see busts of people who have
been of historical importance to Syngorn, and

1194
01:28:11,044 --> 01:28:14,966
eventually you're brought to the very end of this
hallway. Amongst a series of other offshoot

1195
01:28:14,966 --> 01:28:21,958
hallways and doors, there is the next portion of
this journey, this large central chamber. The door

1196
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:27,324
is already partially ajar. You are led into what
seems to be the equivalent of a throne room, but

1197
01:28:27,324 --> 01:28:32,019
it appears that there is a half-circle table in
the center of the room and a series of chairs that

1198
01:28:32,019 --> 01:28:38,371
now sit empty across from one side. Your side. The
other side of the table, you see sitting quietly

1199
01:28:38,371 --> 01:28:45,606
and patiently, an older elven woman, you can see
the grey in her hair and the crow's-nests at the

1200
01:28:45,606 --> 01:28:51,414
corner of her eyes, which in elven years means
she's quite old, she's probably close to 150 or

1201
01:28:51,414 --> 01:28:59,286
200 years old, by your gathering. They can live
quite a long time. She would be in the equivalent

1202
01:28:59,286 --> 01:29:02,392
of her late 50s.

1203
01:29:02,392 --> 01:29:07,177
SAM: Not old enough for our party to kill
mercilessly.

1204
01:29:07,177 --> 01:29:10,097
MATT: No, that's a whole different gauge.

1205
01:29:10,097 --> 01:29:12,092
LIAM: Throwback Thursday.

1206
01:29:12,092 --> 01:29:14,596
LAURA: Is she wearing a hat?

1207
01:29:14,596 --> 01:29:16,196
MATT: She is not wearing a hat.

1208
01:29:16,196 --> 01:29:19,133
TRAVIS: Shit. All right, she lives.

1209
01:29:19,133 --> 01:29:28,561
MATT: The guard behind ushers you guys forward
toward the chairs. You all get the idea that you

1210
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:29,712
should sit.

1211
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:31,907
SAM: We sit.

1212
01:29:31,907 --> 01:29:33,292
MATT: All right.

1213
01:29:33,292 --> 01:29:35,080
MARISHA: Are there chairs for all of us?

1214
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:42,804
MATT: There are chairs for all of you but Trinket,
who currently, one of the guards is helping to put

1215
01:29:42,804 --> 01:29:45,122
his hands out in front to keep back, like.

1216
01:29:45,122 --> 01:29:46,517
LAURA: No.

1217
01:29:46,517 --> 01:29:47,978
LIAM: That's a good way to lose a finger.

1218
01:29:47,978 --> 01:29:53,543
LAURA: I wouldn't mess with him if I were you,
just to be safe. And I walk up and I give Trinket

1219
01:29:53,543 --> 01:29:56,564
a kiss on the nose and I put him in his Pokeball.

1220
01:29:56,603 --> 01:30:01,916
MATT: The guard leaps back for a second. "That's
much easier."

1221
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:05,597
LAURA: Just watch closely, buddy.

1222
01:30:05,597 --> 01:30:08,712
MATT: You step back, you all find your seats.

1223
01:30:08,712 --> 01:30:13,333
LAURA: Just talking to my boobs. No big deal.

1224
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:15,046
LIAM: Buddy, buddy.

1225
01:30:15,046 --> 01:30:21,141
(laughter)

1226
01:30:21,141 --> 01:30:27,097
MATT: This meeting room pavilion, and as you all
have your seat, you see the High Warden waiting

1227
01:30:27,181 --> 01:30:34,062
there patiently, smile on her face but definitely
an expression that shows both intelligence and

1228
01:30:34,116 --> 01:30:43,588
guard. As you all sit, she looks about the group,
asks, "So you've all come and made arrangements to

1229
01:30:43,588 --> 01:30:50,176
"meet with me. You've come quite a ways and with
very short notice. I'm curious as to what your

1230
01:30:50,176 --> 01:30:53,185
"reasonings are. Please, state your business."

1231
01:30:53,185 --> 01:31:03,919
LIAM: You probably recognize the two of us even if
you don't know us. We're Syldor's children. This

1232
01:31:03,919 --> 01:31:06,729
is my sister Vex'ahlia. I'm Vax'ildan.

1233
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:12,798
MATT: "Strange. It has been some time since you've
been within the city. Welcome."

1234
01:31:12,798 --> 01:31:14,471
LIAM: Thank you.

1235
01:31:14,471 --> 01:31:27,216
LAURA: We're back because we're searching for a
certain bow, Fenthras? Said to be within the Murk

1236
01:31:27,216 --> 01:31:28,690
something?

1237
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:31,326
LIAM: Bog of Eternal Stench, I believe.

1238
01:31:31,326 --> 01:31:35,386
MARISHA: Shadowmurk Bog. That's the one.

1239
01:31:35,386 --> 01:31:36,532
MATT: "The Shademirk?"

1240
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:38,133
MARISHA: Shademirk. That's it.

1241
01:31:38,133 --> 01:31:48,947
LIAM: It's not on a lark. We're not a bunch of
fly-by-nights. We've already stopped to see Vex's

1242
01:31:48,994 --> 01:31:56,493
and my father. Over the last several months, we
have been dealing, a little more closely than most

1243
01:31:56,493 --> 01:32:04,759
would want, with the Conclave, these dragons. We
know that you are struggling to do the same. We

1244
01:32:04,759 --> 01:32:14,505
have felled two of them, and I don't say that to
brag, just to impress upon you how serious we are.

1245
01:32:14,505 --> 01:32:28,728
We've come a long way, and we are in need of help.
Thank you, darling. I think that the city's

1246
01:32:28,728 --> 01:32:38,778
intentions are in the best possible place. Brings
me a great deal of personal satisfaction,

1247
01:32:38,778 --> 01:32:53,455
actually. I would like to offer our aid in service
of the very same purpose, and that bow, in my

1248
01:32:53,455 --> 01:32:59,754
sister's hands, will go a long way to felling more
of these beasts.

1249
01:32:59,754 --> 01:33:13,293
MATT: "Well. You stroll in here with a great deal
of arrogance and an air of self-importance. Not in

1250
01:33:13,293 --> 01:33:21,078
"a way that is negative, more in a way that means
you aspire, and I hope, not reaching beyond your

1251
01:33:21,078 --> 01:33:28,559
"means. If you have indeed felled these two members
of the Conclave as you say, then perhaps this

1252
01:33:28,559 --> 01:33:34,936
"errand to the Shademirk is not as dangerous as one
would expect. I would not deny you this, and if

1253
01:33:34,936 --> 01:33:39,311
"you indeed have these capabilities, you should
have no issue surviving the Mirk,

1254
01:33:39,356 --> 01:33:41,356
"you and your companions."

1255
01:33:41,356 --> 01:33:49,077
LAURA: Syldor sent us here because he said you
would know what we might face in the Shademirk.

1256
01:33:49,077 --> 01:33:59,181
MATT: "Well. The Shademirk, as far as I
understand, was once a very beautiful landscape.

1257
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:07,396
"That once was the fountain heart of the Gilded Run
that provided the flowing rivers that spun

1258
01:34:07,396 --> 01:34:17,488
"throughout this entire region. There was an
archfey many years before who was turned on by his

1259
01:34:17,488 --> 01:34:25,375
"beloved, who had been growing so spiteful, so full
of angst and anger and vengeful thoughts that it

1260
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:33,014
"turned his heart dark and black and he began to
spill into the fen around him. It was there that

1261
01:34:33,014 --> 01:34:38,577
"these lands became the Shademirk. It was there
that he became one with the land and corrupted it

1262
01:34:38,577 --> 01:34:46,144
"and turned it. Dryads turned foul and shadowed.
Other creatures began to crawl up from the bog

1263
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:50,986
"itself, and to this day feed off the life of those
they can reach. The only thing that holds its

1264
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:58,842
"spread at bay is the Gilded Run, the rapids. Now,
it's found balance, and we watched it spread, as

1265
01:34:58,842 --> 01:35:05,331
"those who've lived here for a long time do. It
does not force any sort of immediate threat to any

1266
01:35:05,331 --> 01:35:11,365
"of us, and it serves its own purpose. It has its
new-- I shouldn't say new, it's been hundreds of

1267
01:35:11,365 --> 01:35:21,961
"years now-- but its own life, its own biome. And
we could not be ones to mess with that, if you

1268
01:35:21,961 --> 01:35:28,863
"will. But it is dangerous, and it is, for those
who have scouted far enough to see it, say it is

1269
01:35:28,863 --> 01:35:38,464
"akin to wading through an oil slick. It is to walk
into a hungry swamp that

1270
01:35:38,464 --> 01:35:41,703
"never gives up its need to feed."

1271
01:35:41,703 --> 01:35:43,458
LAURA: Sounds lovely.

1272
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:45,067
MATT: "Yes, quite."

1273
01:35:45,067 --> 01:35:56,492
LAURA: You say you've lived here. I know the city
goes back and forth between the Feywild. Do you

1274
01:35:56,492 --> 01:35:58,429
travel more freely?

1275
01:35:58,429 --> 01:36:04,126
MATT: "I haven't in my older years. When I was
younger, perhaps. It is important to maintain an

1276
01:36:04,126 --> 01:36:11,260
"idea of the current state of the Feywild. Every
few decades, perhaps every generation, just to be

1277
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:16,108
"certain when we have to undergo this transition
that we don't come into the middle of a war zone

1278
01:36:16,108 --> 01:36:23,119
"in its own right. But I grow tired in my older
years, and find myself chained to politics more

1279
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:24,764
"often than not."

1280
01:36:24,764 --> 01:36:30,700
LAURA: How did you make that transition so easily?
I know that the threshold crests are how the city

1281
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:32,991
gets around.

1282
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:36,936
(laughter)

1283
01:36:36,936 --> 01:36:45,790
MATT: "Well, there are thin areas between the
planes, there are doorways, and we have magical

1284
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:50,554
"means to send small scouting parties between this
veil."

1285
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:54,713
SAM: Go on.

1286
01:36:54,713 --> 01:37:03,942
LAURA: Well, I don't want to be a bother, yes,
but. Do they entail any part of those threshold

1287
01:37:03,942 --> 01:37:09,848
crests? I'm wondering because perhaps we might
find ourselves in need of traveling, as well.

1288
01:37:09,848 --> 01:37:16,223
LIAM: We know we're strangers. But we read much
wisdom and experience in your eyes, and it would

1289
01:37:16,223 --> 01:37:22,547
seem that you have encountered this place
yourself, or have experience in the past with

1290
01:37:22,547 --> 01:37:26,146
those who have, and we're just looking for an
edge, really.

1291
01:37:26,146 --> 01:37:28,866
MATT: You make a persuasion check.

1292
01:37:28,866 --> 01:37:32,414
LAURA: Oh, do I want to roll this one or do I want
to roll--

1293
01:37:32,414 --> 01:37:33,559
TRAVIS: Oh, just pick one.

1294
01:37:33,559 --> 01:37:34,853
LAURA: Okay.

1295
01:37:34,853 --> 01:37:37,141
MATT: The ever-plight of Laura Bailey.

1296
01:37:37,141 --> 01:37:40,132
LAURA: Ooh! That's a good, that's a good, I'm glad
I switched!

1297
01:37:40,132 --> 01:37:44,067
TRAVIS: There are 300 fucking dice on this table.

1298
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:46,641
LAURA: 27.

1299
01:37:46,641 --> 01:37:48,437
LIAM: Ooh.

1300
01:37:48,437 --> 01:38:03,106
MATT: "We have refined the art of creating the
threshold crests. We have personalized

1301
01:38:03,106 --> 01:38:14,007
"enchantments that can be utilized for our trained
spies, our trained guides, our trained scouts. We

1302

"keep them under lock and key, but when an endeavor
requires the transference between planes, we do on

1303
01:38:20,176 --> 01:38:25,419
"occasion allow these to go into the hands of our
greatest guides."

1304
01:38:25,419 --> 01:38:38,360
LAURA: If a party would be in search of an item
that would be of great use to your survival, would

1305
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,905
that be worthy?

1306
01:38:40,905 --> 01:38:42,895
LIAM: Listen, we know we're bastards.

1307
01:38:42,895 --> 01:38:45,380
LAURA: Stop bringing up the bastard part!

1308
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:59,369
LIAM: Clearly. Look into my eyes, we share the
same goal. Half of my blood is yours. I want to

1309
01:38:59,369 --> 01:39:12,474
kill the threat to your city and to all cities. I
ask with complete humility. I know what I'm

1310
01:39:12,474 --> 01:39:15,964
asking. Please.

1311
01:39:15,964 --> 01:39:19,826
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1312
01:39:19,826 --> 01:39:22,195
LAURA: Which one? Him or me?

1313
01:39:22,195 --> 01:39:23,402
MATT: Him.

1314
01:39:23,402 --> 01:39:26,045
LAURA: Fuck, can I give him advantage, can I help
him?

1315
01:39:26,045 --> 01:39:27,114
LIAM: Using Luck.

1316
01:39:27,114 --> 01:39:28,985
MATT: No, he's got Luck. He has his own.

1317
01:39:28,985 --> 01:39:31,718
LAURA: Come on, you motherfucker.

1318
01:39:31,718 --> 01:39:37,643
LIAM: Ouch. I rolled the same thing. Low number
twice. No, that's a big five.

1319
01:39:37,643 --> 01:39:40,711
LAURA: Wait, no, everything's ten. I thought
everything was a ten!

1320
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:45,891
LIAM: No, that's right, you're right. So that is
a--

1321
01:39:45,891 --> 01:39:48,127
LAURA: 12.

1322
01:39:48,127 --> 01:39:49,370
LIAM: No, 13.

1323
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:51,326
SAM: Oh, that's better.

1324
01:39:51,326 --> 01:39:53,234
MATT: It's better.

1325
01:39:53,377 --> 01:39:58,050
LAURA: Why did you talk? I think she would've
listened to me.

1326
01:39:58,106 --> 01:40:04,926
(laughter)

1327
01:40:04,961 --> 01:40:15,534
MATT: "I appreciate your intent, and I understand
that our current paths will hopefully align in the

1328
01:40:15,534 --> 01:40:23,907
"near future. However, such artifacts are very
important to us and the business within Syngorn,

1329
01:40:24,036 --> 01:40:29,799
"and I mean no offense in saying that you are no
longer residents of our city. As such, no, I

1330
01:40:29,799 --> 01:40:38,372
"cannot provide you with these crystals. However, when
the time comes, and you retrieve this bow which

1331
01:40:38,372 --> 01:40:43,177
"you say you seek, I hope that we can count each
other brethren on the battlefield."

1332
01:40:43,177 --> 01:40:50,330
TRAVIS: Can I look around the room? Are there any
doors open, ajar, leading into a bedroom with a

1333
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,912
hat on a rack?

1334
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:54,552
MATT: Make a perception check, Grog.

1335
01:40:54,552 --> 01:40:56,435
SAM: Are there any guards in here with us?

1336
01:40:56,435 --> 01:40:59,373
MATT: Yeah, the guards have led you in, they're
just back by the front door you entered.

1337
01:40:59,373 --> 01:41:03,209
TALIESIN: There's a hat rack and a Starbucks,
that's what's in the room right there. It's a hat

1338
01:41:03,209 --> 01:41:04,452
rack and a Starbucks.

1339
01:41:04,478 --> 01:41:08,887
TRAVIS: 19. Natural.

1340
01:41:08,887 --> 01:41:13,627
LIAM: I'm rusty on my rules. That should've been a
17.

1341
01:41:13,627 --> 01:41:15,101
MATT: What'd you roll?

1342
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:21,180
LIAM: I rolled a three, but because of reliable
talent, anything lower counts as a ten. Ten plus

1343
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:25,336
my persuasion of seven is 17. I'm just rusty.

1344
01:41:25,336 --> 01:41:27,830
MATT: I understand. Same answer.

1345
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:30,816
(laughter)

1346
01:41:30,816 --> 01:41:33,892
LIAM: That is racist!

1347
01:41:33,892 --> 01:41:39,167
MATT: No, that is a very closely guarded item that
would've required a roll of 20 or higher to

1348
01:41:39,167 --> 01:41:40,535
succeed.

1349
01:41:40,535 --> 01:41:44,068
LIAM: The whole time I was like, that seems wrong
to me; that it's so low.

1350
01:41:44,068 --> 01:41:46,236
MATT: Yeah man, reliable talent's good for that
reason.

1351
01:41:46,236 --> 01:41:48,364
LAURA: Why did your luck suck that time?

1352
01:41:48,364 --> 01:41:57,451
MATT: It's all right. Grog, glancing about the
room, your suddenly strangely keen giant eyes

1353
01:41:57,488 --> 01:42:02,485
in an elvish realm, you who can read patterns in
rock and mountain faces, but when looking at

1354
01:42:02,485 --> 01:42:08,934
finely crafted marble it's just a big mess. You
see at the very back of the chamber what appears

1355
01:42:08,934 --> 01:42:16,892
to be an imprint into one of the sculptures, one
of the almost silver and brass latticework that

1356
01:42:16,892 --> 01:42:21,713
tends to look like climbing roots and vines across
the back of the room. There is a door that is

1357
01:42:21,713 --> 01:42:24,664
recessed within that, though it's hidden in
the sculpture itself.

1358
01:42:24,664 --> 01:42:31,257
"Now. Unless you have other business?"

1359
01:42:31,299 --> 01:42:33,591
SAM: I have a little bit of business.

1360
01:42:33,591 --> 01:42:34,694
MATT: "Yes."

1361
01:42:34,694 --> 01:42:39,927
TALIESIN: Good, carry on. Sorry.

1362
01:42:39,927 --> 01:42:45,768
SAM: Everyone who meets me knows I am a collector
of hats.

1363
01:42:45,768 --> 01:42:55,226
(laughter)

1364
01:42:55,226 --> 01:43:05,619
SAM: I take out my beret and I put it on and I
say, why, this one was a very special beret I got

1365
01:43:05,619 --> 01:43:10,303
by defending Whitestone against an invasion of
vampires, singlehandedly

1366
01:43:10,335 --> 01:43:13,278
freeing the city from the scourge.

1367
01:43:13,278 --> 01:43:15,608
MATT: "That sounds entirely believable."

1368
01:43:15,608 --> 01:43:22,106
SAM: Yes. It's a fine garment woven by a master
craftsman. I hear you have a fine hat, as well,

1369
01:43:22,106 --> 01:43:26,246
that you've been seen wearing about town. Is that
true?

1370
01:43:26,246 --> 01:43:32,335
TALIESIN: I wish I could say this isn't true, but
it's actually true. He is genuine.

1371
01:43:32,335 --> 01:43:37,366
MATT: "I have been known to have a few garments
based on where I'm going, yes."

1372
01:43:37,366 --> 01:43:42,530
SAM: As a fine appreciator of the haberdasher
arts--

1373
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:51,136
(laughter)

1374
01:43:51,136 --> 01:44:00,311
SAM: A connoisseur, really. Could you humor an old
gnome like me and show me... I hear tell of a

1375
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:04,641
green hat. A tri-tip hat, right?

1376
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:05,968
MARISHA: I thought it was blue.

1377
01:44:05,968 --> 01:44:06,964
SAM: Blue hat?

1378
01:44:06,964 --> 01:44:08,133
MARISHA: Might be green.

1379
01:44:08,133 --> 01:44:10,562
TALIESIN: He's also colorblind, I should
mention.

1380
01:44:10,562 --> 01:44:15,603
SAM: Tri-tip, triangular-- I just hear it's
fantastic, I've never seen one quite like it up

1381
01:44:15,603 --> 01:44:18,764
close. I was wondering if I could take a
look-see.

1382
01:44:18,764 --> 01:44:21,086
MATT: Make a deception check.

1383
01:44:21,086 --> 01:44:24,908
SAM: With disadvantage.

1384
01:44:24,908 --> 01:44:26,732
MATT: Yeah, because you didn't sleep.

1385
01:44:26,732 --> 01:44:28,937
MARISHA: Yeah, you didn't sleep, Scanlan!

1386
01:44:28,937 --> 01:44:38,600
SAM: Well, that was a natural 20. But the first
one was a six.

1387
01:44:38,648 --> 01:44:40,662
Luckily, it's plus 14, so 20.

1388
01:44:40,662 --> 01:44:44,231
(laughing and cheering)

1389
01:44:44,231 --> 01:44:47,385
[no audio]

1390
01:44:47,385 --> 01:44:54,195
MATT: Bards! "From political requests to a hat
collector, this is indeed a very strange afternoon

1391
01:44:54,195 --> 01:44:58,718
"in the palace. Yes, I can have one of my servants
show you."

1392
01:44:58,718 --> 01:45:04,500
SAM: Thank you so much, it would mean so much to
me. I've never met a hat I didn't like.

1393
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:08,822
MATT: "Then I am certain you will be fulfilled."

1394
01:45:08,822 --> 01:45:14,302
SAM: Should we just wait here, or is it going to
be a while?

1395
01:45:14,414 --> 01:45:18,864
MATT: "No, I'll have a servant bring you up." And
she puts her hand up and the guards open the door

1396
01:45:18,864 --> 01:45:27,069
and you see a servant walk out who looks to be a
younger elven man. Actually probably about the age

1397
01:45:27,069 --> 01:45:31,519
of Vax there. Short tattered hair comes across in
front of his eyes.

1398
01:45:31,519 --> 01:45:34,850
He enters. "Yes, mother?"

1399
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:42,014
"Could you please show this strange little gnome
man to the hat room?"

1400
01:45:42,014 --> 01:45:47,993
"Yes, of course. Yes. Follow me."

1401
01:45:47,993 --> 01:45:51,267
SAM: There's a hat room? I have a hat room in my
place, too!

1402
01:45:51,267 --> 01:45:55,674
MATT: "That's splendid. Now, is there any other
business?"

1403
01:45:55,674 --> 01:46:02,948
TALIESIN: Just to be clear, you would say that the
river is probably our safest mode of entry into

1404
01:46:02,948 --> 01:46:04,064
the bog?

1405
01:46:04,064 --> 01:46:09,572
MATT: "It surrounds the bog and runs past the
southern portion of it, so you'll most likely come

1406
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:14,690
"upon the river one way or another. Lest you wish
to traverse the Green Sea, but that I would not

1407
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:16,130
"recommend, either."

1408
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:19,945
MARISHA: So there's no real easy way into the bog,
is what you're saying?

1409
01:46:19,945 --> 01:46:22,816
MATT: "There's no easy way to anything in the
Feywild, my child."

1410
01:46:22,816 --> 01:46:23,817
MARISHA: Got it.

1411
01:46:23,817 --> 01:46:26,343
LAURA: Have you seen the tree yourself?

1412
01:46:26,343 --> 01:46:27,599
MATT: "I have not."

1413
01:46:27,599 --> 01:46:32,330
TALIESIN: Are there river men who run boats on the
river?

1414
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:36,023
MATT: "No, the river tends to run itself."

1415
01:46:36,118 --> 01:46:39,999
(laughter)

1416
01:46:40,068 --> 01:46:42,322
TALIESIN: I had that coming. That's fair.

1417
01:46:42,463 --> 01:46:43,973
TRAVIS: That's good.

1418
01:46:43,973 --> 01:46:51,112
MATT: "Do you wish to inquire about my shoes? My
coat perhaps..."

1419
01:46:51,112 --> 01:46:56,563
MARISHA: Oh my god, they're so cute, though.
They're amazing shoes. I didn't notice them until

1420
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,888
you pointed them out, sorry. No, continue on.

1421
01:46:59,888 --> 01:47:00,987
MATT: "Is that all?"

1422
01:47:00,987 --> 01:47:02,089
TALIESIN: I think that's all, yes.

1423
01:47:02,089 --> 01:47:05,903
MATT: "All right. Good luck. I wish you safe--"

1424
01:47:05,903 --> 01:47:07,129
MARISHA: Oh, wait, wait, lady!

1425
01:47:07,129 --> 01:47:10,394
SAM: High Warden, High Warden.

1426
01:47:10,394 --> 01:47:18,489
MARISHA: High Warden. I'm sorry. I was just
curious. It's my first time to Syngorn, and it's

1427
01:47:18,489 --> 01:47:35,228
in the Feywild. It's special, right? Is there a
gift shop? A visiting the temple and sights of

1428
01:47:35,228 --> 01:47:37,094
Syngorn type of shop?

1429
01:47:37,094 --> 01:47:39,447
SAM: I went to Syngorn and all I got was this
lousy shirt?

1430
01:47:39,447 --> 01:47:40,533
MARISHA: Right!

1431
01:47:40,533 --> 01:47:42,946
LAURA: We have to make that shirt!

1432
01:47:42,946 --> 01:47:49,087
LIAM: Shirt after this one.

1433
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:55,759
MATT: "I'll see what Braum can do. Braum, please
escort them to some semblance of a gift shop."

1434
01:47:55,759 --> 01:47:57,012
MARISHA: Oh, thank you!

1435
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:58,265
TALIESIN: Good luck.

1436
01:47:58,265 --> 01:48:06,203
MATT: "Now, I have important business to tend to.
Good luck. Safe travels. Don't die. Let us see

1437
01:48:06,203 --> 01:48:10,624
"each other on the battlefield soon to slay a
dragon. Now, please, be on your way."

1438
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:12,237
LAURA: We appreciate your time.

1439
01:48:12,237 --> 01:48:14,826
MATT: You guys get up and leave, Trinket goes--

1440
01:48:14,826 --> 01:48:17,094
LAURA: Trinket's in my necklace.

1441
01:48:17,094 --> 01:48:20,734
MATT: That's right, Trinket is in your necklace,
so Trinket does nothing.

1442
01:48:20,734 --> 01:48:23,288
LAURA: Trinket does nothing but stare outside of
the necklace.

1443
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:27,721
MATT: You make your way out of the room, the
guards following suit. You can see the lightish

1444
01:48:27,721 --> 01:48:31,711
brownish reddish tousled hair of the elven boy
who's waiting, he's wearing very fine clothing,

1445
01:48:31,711 --> 01:48:38,396
though very baggy on his scrawny frame. As you all
step out, he says, "All right, so, I'm to take you

1446
01:48:38,396 --> 01:48:44,831
"to the hat room, I believe. Oh, you're going to be
very happy. It's quite the room."

1447
01:48:44,831 --> 01:48:48,916
SAM: The room I could care less about, it's those
hats!

1448
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:54,637
MATT: "Well, I think you'll still be pleased. Are
you all coming?"

1449
01:48:54,637 --> 01:48:58,900
(noises of agreement)

1450
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:02,401
LIAM: Traveling with Scanlan, we've all become
amateur hat enthusiasts.

1451
01:49:02,401 --> 01:49:04,187
LAURA: I pull out my hat and I put it on.

1452
01:49:04,187 --> 01:49:06,915
TRAVIS: Yep, I pull out the rhinoceros horn.

1453
01:49:06,915 --> 01:49:08,320
LIAM: (gong)

1454
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:15,896
(laughter)

1455
01:49:15,896 --> 01:49:20,259
MATT: And he pulls out a little masquerade mask
and goes like, "Oh my goodness!"

1456
01:49:20,259 --> 01:49:21,614
SAM: You're a hatter, too!

1457
01:49:21,614 --> 01:49:23,436
MARISHA: Do you get the monthly newsletter?

1458
01:49:23,436 --> 01:49:29,658
MATT: "Well, I used to, until we came to the
Feywild. It's very boring these days. Well, come,

1459
01:49:29,658 --> 01:49:37,145
"please!" And he darts off excitedly down the
hallway. The guards groan loudly behind you. You

1460
01:49:37,145 --> 01:49:42,384
make your way through the second hallway on the
left of the palace, down a flight of stairs into a

1461
01:49:42,384 --> 01:49:48,806
storage room. To the left you can see what looks
to be the entrance to some sort of a heavily

1462
01:49:48,806 --> 01:49:56,147
barred metallic doorway, about ten feet wide,
about 12 feet tall. Further down you come to two

1463
01:49:56,147 --> 01:50:02,713
doorways. He pulls out a keyring, goes, "No, not
that one. Ah, here we are." It opens up into a

1464
01:50:02,713 --> 01:50:08,357
small room, you can see in here, it's a display
room. In here you can see ornamental armor and

1465
01:50:08,357 --> 01:50:15,894
helmets and all sorts of classic Syngorean
designs, which change often because, well, elves

1466
01:50:15,894 --> 01:50:19,350
when they don't have a lot of things to fill their
time with, it's all about designing new outfits

1467
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:27,886
and new armor. There's a whole display of very
classic designs for the guards, for the watchers,

1468
01:50:27,886 --> 01:50:35,646
for the people who first founded Syngorn. It's
like a history walk through. But there is a

1469
01:50:35,646 --> 01:50:40,848
section that is primarily helmet designs for
different stations and, "This is as close to a hat

1470
01:50:40,848 --> 01:50:51,125
"room as we have. This here is part of the original
Temple of Ioun design. It is a delightful piece."

1471
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:52,663
He keeps going on and on.

1472
01:50:52,663 --> 01:50:56,048
LAURA: Do we see the hat that we're looking for in
here?

1473
01:50:56,048 --> 01:51:00,815
MATT: You do see there is a small rack to the side
which is for more just things that are used and

1474
01:51:00,815 --> 01:51:06,157
you can see there are like wide-brim, rainy-day,
carriage-driving hats, you can see there are

1475
01:51:06,157 --> 01:51:15,689
far-brimmed cloak hoods that are used for
horse-riding beneath the rain, you can see there

1476
01:51:15,689 --> 01:51:23,145
are a few more curved up to one side archer-based
hats, and you can see there a nice green velvet

1477
01:51:23,145 --> 01:51:25,624
hat that is resting across.

1478
01:51:25,624 --> 01:51:27,488
LIAM: Is that the one area with hats?

1479
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:29,818
LAURA: Are they all just jumbled in together?

1480
01:51:29,818 --> 01:51:33,761
MATT: They're all jumbled in together in that
corner and then the actual helmets are against the

1481
01:51:33,761 --> 01:51:35,097
wall in different setups.

1482
01:51:35,097 --> 01:51:36,371
LIAM: Go ahead.

1483
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:40,435
LAURA: I nudge Vax and I point it out.

1484
01:51:40,435 --> 01:51:44,393
LIAM: Scanlan, look at all those codpieces across
the room!

1485
01:51:44,393 --> 01:51:46,651
LAURA: Are the guards in here with us?

1486
01:51:46,651 --> 01:51:47,954
MATT: They are, yes.

1487
01:51:47,954 --> 01:51:52,544
LAURA: I prat-fucking-fall. I pratfall right in
front of the guards, on

1488
01:51:52,544 --> 01:51:53,724
the opposite side of the room.

1489
01:51:53,724 --> 01:51:54,794
MATT: Which one?

1490
01:51:54,794 --> 01:51:57,015
LAURA: I walk to the other side of the room and I
just fall over.

1491
01:51:57,015 --> 01:51:58,566
LIAM: Eat shit, knock shit over.

1492
01:51:58,566 --> 01:51:59,983
MATT: Make a perform check.

1493
01:51:59,983 --> 01:52:05,560
LAURA: Oh, shit. Can it be acrobatics, though?

1494
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:08,682
MATT: No, acrobatics is avoiding the fall.

1495
01:52:08,682 --> 01:52:11,301
LAURA: Shit. Okay. 19?

1496
01:52:11,301 --> 01:52:12,578
MATT: 19!

1497
01:52:12,578 --> 01:52:14,379
LAURA: I want to take some shit down with me.

1498
01:52:14,379 --> 01:52:19,751
MATT: And you do, delightfully so. You fall over,
trip, go into a tumble, grab arm over pieces of

1499
01:52:19,751 --> 01:52:21,378
metallic armor, (crashing sound).

1500
01:52:21,378 --> 01:52:23,396
LAURA: Ah, oh god, did you see that--

1501
01:52:23,396 --> 01:52:25,461
MARISHA: Oh my god, Vex, are you okay?

1502
01:52:25,461 --> 01:52:28,092
LAURA: I think there was a marble on the ground.

1503
01:52:28,092 --> 01:52:32,592
MARISHA: Oh no, what? Keyleth turns to the guard.

1504
01:52:32,592 --> 01:52:43,776
(laughter)

1505
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:52,838
MARISHA: That was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of
Whitestone. I could sue you! I could sue you for

1506
01:52:52,838 --> 01:52:53,805
negligence.

1507
01:52:53,805 --> 01:52:55,861
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

1508
01:52:55,861 --> 01:52:58,447
SAM: Hold on, he's making a check.

1509
01:52:58,447 --> 01:52:59,507
LIAM: 24.

1510
01:52:59,507 --> 01:53:08,351
MATT: All right. You take the hat. You place it
away. Everyone seems to be focused on the

1511
01:53:08,351 --> 01:53:10,537
currently yelling Vex'ahlia--

1512
01:53:10,537 --> 01:53:12,726
LAURA: Ow, I think I hurt my wrist!

1513
01:53:12,726 --> 01:53:17,184
MARISHA: You will get a letter from me, good sir.
You will get a letter, okay?

1514
01:53:17,184 --> 01:53:21,839
MATT: "This was, look, I apologize if your friend
is clumsy, but this wasn't part of our job

1515
01:53:21,839 --> 01:53:23,766
"description, okay, it's been a very--"

1516
01:53:23,766 --> 01:53:28,350
MARISHA: Your five-star review just went to a
four, okay? I just want to say.

1517
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:33,739
MATT: Braum pushes his way in and goes like, "I am
so terribly sorry. I didn't mean-- I hope this

1518
01:53:33,739 --> 01:53:35,728
"hasn't ruined your opinion of the hat room."

1519
01:53:35,728 --> 01:53:39,839
LAURA: If we could just see a gift shop, I would
be thrilled.

1520
01:53:39,839 --> 01:53:42,519
TRAVIS: And I say to the side, I go, (coughs)
pinch my knee, is that the one?

1521
01:53:42,519 --> 01:53:45,669
MARISHA: What?

1522
01:53:45,669 --> 01:53:47,275
MATT: "Are you feeling all right, sir?"

1523
01:53:47,275 --> 01:53:53,924
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, (coughs) pinch my knee if that's
the one. No, to the little, to the little satyr.

1524
01:53:53,924 --> 01:54:01,799
TALIESIN: Let's just find a gift shop, Lady Tyrell
doesn't need to hear anything about this. Let's

1525
01:54:01,799 --> 01:54:03,289
just move on.

1526
01:54:03,289 --> 01:54:05,210
MATT: "Lady who?"

1527
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:08,125
MARISHA and SAM: High Warden Tyrelda.

1528
01:54:08,125 --> 01:54:09,852
TALIESIN: Tyrelda.

1529
01:54:09,852 --> 01:54:15,063
SAM: Yes, well, there's another lady named Lady
Tyrell, who's...

1530
01:54:15,063 --> 01:54:18,897
TALIESIN: No, this is amazing what my handwriting
does.

1531
01:54:18,897 --> 01:54:21,527
LIAM: What did you put in that tea, Percival?

1532
01:54:21,527 --> 01:54:29,355
MATT: "Well, I'm glad to see this hasn't ruined
your opinion of the collections here."

1533
01:54:29,355 --> 01:54:31,889
LIAM: Just the safety codes, really.

1534
01:54:31,889 --> 01:54:37,414
MARISHA: If you took us to the gift shop, it might
fix things. Okay?

1535
01:54:37,414 --> 01:54:42,795
MATT: "Then come, come! You two clean this up!"
And the two guards go, "What?"

1536
01:54:42,795 --> 01:54:53,350
"Yes, my lord." And the two guards eye you very
intensely as they walk over and start picking up

1537
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:54,796
all the pieces of armor--

1538
01:54:54,796 --> 01:54:57,014
LAURA: Ow!

1539
01:54:57,014 --> 01:55:01,208
MARISHA: I start pretending like I'm doing a Cure
Wounds spell to her wrist, you know?

1540
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:04,058
MATT: All right. As you guys make your way out,
with two of the guards now; two of them are now

1541
01:55:04,058 --> 01:55:05,039
left behind.

1542
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:07,861
TALIESIN: As we walk out, I just make sure the two
guards are, I hope this didn't interrupt your

1543
01:55:07,861 --> 01:55:09,463
schedules for today.

1544
01:55:09,463 --> 01:55:11,592
SAM: "Shedule."

1545
01:55:11,592 --> 01:55:13,093
TALIESIN: Yes, schedule.

1546
01:55:13,093 --> 01:55:20,695
MATT: Somehow their chin goes higher. It's
impressive, really. You make your way through,

1547
01:55:20,695 --> 01:55:25,369
down another set of hallways, back towards the
beginning of the palace, he goes, "It's not really

1548
01:55:25,369 --> 01:55:31,559
"a gift shop, the closest thing that we could
ascertain based on your request is, we do have a

1549
01:55:31,559 --> 01:55:37,253
"small collection of gifts and knick-knacks we've
received from allies over time that really aren't

1550
01:55:37,253 --> 01:55:38,752
"much use to us."

1551
01:55:38,752 --> 01:55:47,474
MARISHA: Wait, you're taking us to the lost and
found? Please! This is the high baroness Lady

1552
01:55:47,474 --> 01:55:48,527
Vex'ahlia!

1553
01:55:48,527 --> 01:55:51,361
MATT: "Perhaps you'll find something you like."

1554
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:54,349
LAURA: No, lost and found is a wonderful place to
go.

1555
01:55:54,349 --> 01:56:02,108
MATT: "It's a combination lost and found and
just... gifts from political allies that didn't

1556
01:56:02,108 --> 01:56:08,742
"understand the High Warden's aesthetic. Yes, no,
please, this way please." And he leads you back to

1557
01:56:08,742 --> 01:56:12,027
the main hallway you guys walked through, a little
ways towards the entrance, and then another

1558
01:56:12,027 --> 01:56:18,587
hallway to the left, he unlocks and this is
straight-up like a dark storage room, it is just

1559
01:56:18,587 --> 01:56:24,589
boxes and boxes that are sealed and he lights a
small lantern on the side. It flickers to life,

1560
01:56:24,589 --> 01:56:29,307
and the flame itself, as opposed to a low oil
lantern flicker is like a bright glowing light,

1561
01:56:29,348 --> 01:56:33,196
you can see this is a magically set lantern, as
most of the lights in the city are just everlit

1562
01:56:33,196 --> 01:56:37,190
torches or things that flicker on and off as a
light spell. It illuminates the room around you

1563
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:39,959
and you can see no one's walked in here in a
while.

1564
01:56:39,959 --> 01:56:41,550
LIAM: These are for sale?

1565
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:45,168
MATT: "No, these are for the taking should you
wish."

1566
01:56:45,168 --> 01:56:47,012
LAURA: Awesome.

1567
01:56:47,012 --> 01:56:49,953
SAM: Well, what do we see?

1568
01:56:49,953 --> 01:56:52,558
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

1569
01:56:52,558 --> 01:56:55,232
MARISHA: Can I ask a logistical question?

1570
01:56:55,232 --> 01:56:56,097
MATT: Sure.

1571
01:56:56,097 --> 01:56:58,780
MARISHA: Is Garmelie with us or did we leave him
behind?

1572
01:56:58,780 --> 01:56:59,867
MATT: You don't know.

1573
01:56:59,867 --> 01:57:00,988
MARISHA: What?

1574
01:57:00,988 --> 01:57:02,193
TALIESIN: You don't know.

1575
01:57:02,193 --> 01:57:03,352
SAM: Grog might know.

1576
01:57:03,352 --> 01:57:04,686
LIAM: 18.

1577
01:57:04,686 --> 01:57:06,017
MARISHA: Grog.

1578
01:57:06,017 --> 01:57:07,272
LAURA: 19.

1579
01:57:07,272 --> 01:57:09,323
MATT: 18, 19, are you searching, Grog?

1580
01:57:09,323 --> 01:57:10,156
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1581
01:57:10,156 --> 01:57:10,975
MATT: What'd you get?

1582
01:57:10,975 --> 01:57:11,782
TRAVIS: Nine.

1583
01:57:11,782 --> 01:57:13,261
(laughter)

1584
01:57:13,261 --> 01:57:15,083
MARISHA: Wait, is this an investigation?

1585
01:57:15,083 --> 01:57:16,180
LAURA: Come on, natural 20!

1586
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:17,364
MARISHA: Natural one.

1587
01:57:17,364 --> 01:57:19,465
LIAM: Oh, propeller beanie!

1588
01:57:19,465 --> 01:57:22,374
MATT: Keyleth is distracted by the pretty light in
the fixture.

1589
01:57:22,374 --> 01:57:23,803
SAM: Natural one.

1590
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:25,922
(laughter)

1591
01:57:25,922 --> 01:57:31,392
MATT: Scanlan comes up next to her and is equally
distracted by this wonderful magical light. Like

1592
01:57:31,392 --> 01:57:34,513
two moths to a flame. Percival?

1593
01:57:34,513 --> 01:57:35,529
TALIESIN: Nine.

1594
01:57:35,529 --> 01:57:44,917
MATT: Nine. All right. The two twins, you guys
spend some time looking through the nearby

1595
01:57:44,917 --> 01:57:53,163
riffraff and Braum is in the back, hoping you find
something to satiate your need for gifts. The

1596
01:57:53,163 --> 01:58:02,122
twins find their way through a few boxes, and you
open up and there's small porcelain dolls, dressed

1597
01:58:02,122 --> 01:58:10,621
up in ancient Emon's outfits and designs. You can
see what looks to be very dusty Kraghammer

1598
01:58:10,621 --> 01:58:19,381
designed weaponry, you can see what looks to be a
bunch of small game pieces that half of them have

1599
01:58:19,381 --> 01:58:24,735
been lost, like a chessboard of some kind, but
only part of it's there. This is really the junk

1600
01:58:24,735 --> 01:58:31,009
room. This is where all the really bad Christmas
presents get put every year.

1601
01:58:31,009 --> 01:58:32,643
"No, thanks, it's great!"

1602
01:58:32,643 --> 01:58:35,409
SAM: Is it like Storage Wars, where there might be
something?

1603
01:58:35,409 --> 01:58:40,097
MATT: It could, it could be depending on how well
you search.

1604
01:58:40,097 --> 01:58:41,734
SAM: Well, I searched terribly.

1605
01:58:41,869 --> 01:58:43,144
MATT: You did.

1606
01:58:43,144 --> 01:58:45,912
MARISHA: Keyleth starts talking up Braum. Braum?

1607
01:58:45,912 --> 01:58:46,962
MATT: Okay. Braum.

1608
01:58:46,962 --> 01:58:50,752
MARISHA: Braum. So, Braum. Where're you from?

1609
01:58:50,752 --> 01:58:54,203
MATT: "Syngorn?"

1610
01:58:54,203 --> 01:58:56,258
(laughter)

1611
01:58:56,258 --> 01:58:57,220
TRAVIS: Good start.

1612
01:58:57,220 --> 01:59:01,440
SAM: We don't have to distract him, he said it's
all for the taking.

1613
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,304
MARISHA: Oh, it's all for-- really, oh.

1614
01:59:03,304 --> 01:59:04,994
SAM: No, that's fine, we don't have to.

1615
01:59:04,994 --> 01:59:10,969
MARISHA: You didn't see any distraction. You
didn't see anything.

1616
01:59:10,969 --> 01:59:13,655
MATT: "I am so confused by all of you."

1617
01:59:13,655 --> 01:59:16,178
LAURA: Can I try to do an arcana check to see if
there's anything magic in the room?

1618
01:59:16,178 --> 01:59:20,550
MATT: Sure. Make an arcana check.

1619
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:25,722
TRAVIS: I'll join you. Two.

1620
01:59:25,722 --> 01:59:31,430
LAURA: Oh shit, I just rolled off the table. How
did I do that? 16.

1621
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:37,039
MATT: Your untrained, though natural arcane
instincts reveal to you that--

1622
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:38,463
LAURA: I can speak with animals.

1623
01:59:38,463 --> 01:59:44,996
MATT: Yes, you can. And there are no animals here.
Nothing even remotely magical seems to cross your

1624
01:59:44,996 --> 01:59:49,067
attention span, unfortunately, and you guys spend
a good hour in here sifting through--

1625
01:59:49,067 --> 01:59:56,373
LIAM: As, as we're digging in the corner, I say, I
thought maybe coming back here I might like this

1626
01:59:56,373 --> 01:59:59,381
city a little bit better, and I was fucking
wrong.

1627
01:59:59,381 --> 02:00:02,325
LAURA: This place fucking sucks.

1628
02:00:02,325 --> 02:00:03,777
SAM: Let's get out of here.

1629
02:00:03,777 --> 02:00:05,046
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's nothing in here.

1630
02:00:05,046 --> 02:00:07,064
SAM: No, let's leave.

1631
02:00:07,064 --> 02:00:09,836
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.

1632
02:00:09,836 --> 02:00:10,981
TRAVIS: Let's go.

1633
02:00:10,981 --> 02:00:12,117
TALIESIN: Pick something pretty.

1634
02:00:12,117 --> 02:00:14,579
MARISHA: Your four-star rating just went down to a
three.

1635
02:00:14,736 --> 02:00:19,267
TALIESIN: I am picking something random from the
room.

1636
02:00:19,267 --> 02:00:25,798
MARISHA: And I'll also pick something random out
of spite. I'll take this.

1637
02:00:25,798 --> 02:00:29,763
MATT: You have a fine tobacco box at your disposal
now, Keyleth. You can write that down.

1638
02:00:29,763 --> 02:00:33,295
MARISHA: I like it. I chose it on purpose.

1639
02:00:33,295 --> 02:00:37,416
MATT: Percy, you find half of a jeweler's kit.

1640
02:00:37,416 --> 02:00:38,856
TALIESIN: That's perfect.

1641
02:00:38,856 --> 02:00:40,312
MARISHA: That's awesome.

1642
02:00:40,312 --> 02:00:45,624
TALIESIN: I am excited. Was it literally cut in
half, like literally?

1643
02:00:45,624 --> 02:00:47,283
MATT: Half the supplies are there.

1644
02:00:47,283 --> 02:00:50,400
MARISHA: And did you say I had a half a tobacco
box? Or no, just a tobacco box?

1645
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,633
MATT: You had an older tobacco box.

1646
02:00:51,633 --> 02:00:53,783
MARISHA: An old tobacco box. All right. Yeah,
sure.

1647
02:00:53,783 --> 02:00:57,414
MATT: Braum at this point goes, "I hope you've all
found something you liked."

1648
02:00:57,414 --> 02:01:03,088
LAURA: All right, I grab something random, too. I
mean, if we're all doing it.

1649
02:01:03,088 --> 02:01:10,206
MATT: All right. You reach into the Syngorean
Wal-mart gift bag on the way out.

1650
02:01:10,206 --> 02:01:11,844
LIAM: Come on, secret Santa.

1651
02:01:11,844 --> 02:01:14,565
LAURA: Come on. Roll for value.

1652
02:01:14,565 --> 02:01:17,225
MATT: No. I'll do that.

1653
02:01:17,225 --> 02:01:19,814
LAURA: No whammies.

1654
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:28,261
MATT: You bring out what looks to be a really
intricately carved music box made of dark wood.

1655
02:01:28,261 --> 02:01:30,413
LAURA: Ooh, that's neat.

1656
02:01:30,413 --> 02:01:34,741
MATT: As you shake it, you hear (ting-ting) little
remnants of the last winding come through, and it

1657
02:01:34,741 --> 02:01:36,283
seems to still play.

1658
02:01:36,283 --> 02:01:39,371
LAURA: Mine. I'm writing it down.

1659
02:01:39,371 --> 02:01:45,387
TRAVIS: All right, I want to reach in and grab
something out of there too. All right, fine!

1660
02:01:45,387 --> 02:01:47,328
MATT: You reach in and you pull out a potato.

1661
02:01:47,328 --> 02:01:57,213
(laughter)

1662
02:01:57,213 --> 02:01:59,986
MATT: But it's been there for a while, so like the
roots are growing out and everything.

1663
02:01:59,986 --> 02:02:01,607
LIAM: Oh, with leaves coming out of it.

1664
02:02:01,607 --> 02:02:02,378
MATT: Yeah.

1665
02:02:02,378 --> 02:02:04,585
TRAVIS: I take a bite out of it.

1666
02:02:04,585 --> 02:02:07,186
MATT: That is a stale potato.

1667
02:02:07,186 --> 02:02:09,810
LIAM: Make a constitution check.

1668
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:13,279
MARISHA: Keyleth takes the potato. Okay, give it
to me, give it to me.

1669
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:15,294
TRAVIS: Oh here you go. And I squash it in my
hand.

1670
02:02:15,294 --> 02:02:21,985
MATT: (squelch) up the sides of it. Braum goes,
"If you could clean that up?" And the guard goes

1671
02:02:21,985 --> 02:02:27,788
aww and starts picking up the potato chunks off
the ground.

1672
02:02:27,788 --> 02:02:29,294
LAURA: We're down to one!

1673
02:02:29,294 --> 02:02:31,346
LIAM: Hey gang, I feel like we've lost focus
here.

1674
02:02:31,346 --> 02:02:32,729
(laughter)

1675
02:02:32,729 --> 02:02:34,689
LIAM: Maybe we should--

1676
02:02:34,689 --> 02:02:35,670
SAM: --get out of here.

1677
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:38,425
LAURA: Oh, do we find any broken threshold
crests?

1678
02:02:38,425 --> 02:02:39,739
MATT: You do not.

1679
02:02:39,739 --> 02:02:40,776
LAURA: Damn it.

1680
02:02:40,776 --> 02:02:46,388
MARISHA: Okay, wait, do we find any pictures of
threshold crests? Or a postcard?

1681
02:02:46,388 --> 02:02:47,393
MATT: Nope.

1682
02:02:47,393 --> 02:02:48,505
TALIESIN: We're fine.

1683
02:02:48,505 --> 02:02:49,476
LAURA: All right.

1684
02:02:49,476 --> 02:02:50,375
TRAVIS: We leave.

1685
02:02:50,375 --> 02:02:52,448
MARISHA: We'll just go.

1686
02:02:52,448 --> 02:02:54,149
SAM: We got the hat.

1687
02:02:54,149 --> 02:02:55,543
TALIESIN: We have a plan.

1688
02:02:55,543 --> 02:03:00,889
MATT: Braum leads you out of the room, closes and
locks it behind, you guys walk back to the hallway

1689
02:03:00,889 --> 02:03:05,506
that split off, you go past the large metal door
again, find your way up into the foyer area at the

1690
02:03:05,506 --> 02:03:10,607
front of the palace, he goes, "Well, I hope I've
been of help to you. I hope I've delivered your

1691
02:03:10,607 --> 02:03:14,131
"interest in seeing our fine selection of helmets
and hats here in Syngorn?"

1692
02:03:14,131 --> 02:03:18,330
SAM: I am more than satisfied. I will write a
five-star review.

1693
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:24,140
MATT: "I don't know what any of that means, but I
assume that's good, and I thank you for that.

1694
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:26,842
"Goodbye."

1695
02:03:26,842 --> 02:03:27,926
LAURA: Thank you.

1696
02:03:27,926 --> 02:03:28,925
TALIESIN: Charming.

1697
02:03:28,925 --> 02:03:29,944
MARISHA: Good day.

1698
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:31,195
LAURA: Good day.

1699
02:03:31,195 --> 02:03:35,046
MATT: The guard that was cleaning the potato
follows suit, you guys now have two guards, the

1700
02:03:35,046 --> 02:03:37,551
other two have not returned. So you have two
guards following you.

1701
02:03:37,551 --> 02:03:43,185
TRAVIS: I don't know if you guys noticed, but
there was this recessed door up in the queenie's

1702
02:03:43,185 --> 02:03:47,741
room, but I don't know if maybe she would have
some fancy stuff back there.

1703
02:03:47,741 --> 02:03:49,696
Can't shake these guards.

1704
02:03:49,696 --> 02:03:55,166
SAM: Well, some of us could slip in anyway, but
what do you think we will find there?

1705
02:03:55,166 --> 02:03:59,266
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know. I just noticed,
because I wasn't paying attention to all the

1706
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:00,436
talking.

1707
02:04:00,436 --> 02:04:05,693
MARISHA: I think Percy and I can fake them out.

1708
02:04:05,693 --> 02:04:07,693
SAM: Fake them out? What do you mean, fake them
out?

1709
02:04:07,693 --> 02:04:09,694
MARISHA: Wait, is he around? Don't say it out
loud.

1710
02:04:09,694 --> 02:04:18,068
TALIESIN: There's no fake. It's not faking. I've
got a plan. It's not fake, I've got a plan. It's a

1711
02:04:18,068 --> 02:04:23,570
good plan. But we should sit, recuperate, go
somewhere quiet and figure out how we're getting

1712
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:24,989
to the bog.

1713
02:04:24,989 --> 02:04:27,371
MARISHA: How long have we been awake at this
point?

1714
02:04:27,371 --> 02:04:32,382
MATT: You mean since you guys woke up this
morning, I'd say six hours?

1715
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:33,882
LAURA: That's it?

1716
02:04:33,882 --> 02:04:37,531
TRAVIS: We don't want to go try and bust one of
the crests we already saw?

1717
02:04:37,531 --> 02:04:42,489
LAURA: We could seriously like fuck it up, what if
they can't get back?

1718
02:04:42,489 --> 02:04:44,661
TRAVIS: Who gives a fuck?

1719
02:04:44,661 --> 02:04:48,127
LAURA: They have an entire army to help fight
Thordak.

1720
02:04:48,127 --> 02:04:51,359
TRAVIS: I didn't think that far ahead, I'm sorry.

1721
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:57,116
SAM: Well, Vex, they could repair it; they have
magicians here and stuff.

1722
02:04:57,116 --> 02:04:58,374
TRAVIS: Thank you, Scanlan.

1723
02:04:58,374 --> 02:04:59,858
TALIESIN: How do you repair a--

1724
02:04:59,858 --> 02:05:02,786
SAM: With arcane juju.

1725
02:05:02,786 --> 02:05:07,088
LAURA: You make a very good point. A very good
point.

1726
02:05:07,088 --> 02:05:12,642
MARISHA: But they said they got these stones from
the other side, from our realm.

1727
02:05:12,642 --> 02:05:14,782
LAURA: Maybe we should just go fucking check them
out.

1728
02:05:14,782 --> 02:05:17,637
LIAM: The two guards are here to whole time,
right?

1729
02:05:17,637 --> 02:05:18,602
MATT: Yes.

1730
02:05:18,602 --> 02:05:23,231
LIAM: Yeah. We should really go take a nap, I
think we should go take a nap.

1731
02:05:23,278 --> 02:05:27,496
LAURA: This dusk is really making me--

1732
02:05:27,496 --> 02:05:31,183
MATT: Vex. You hear muttered under the breath of
one of the guards, "Thank god."

1733
02:05:31,183 --> 02:05:33,337
(laughter)

1734
02:05:33,337 --> 02:05:35,059
MATT: Very low; nobody else hears it.

1735
02:05:35,059 --> 02:05:37,199
MARISHA: I've got plenty of energy.

1736
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:40,615
LAURA: I mean, is, is anyone else super duper
tired? Are you guys tired?

1737
02:05:40,615 --> 02:05:41,887
MARISHA: I'm--

1738
02:05:41,887 --> 02:05:44,380
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Tired.

1739
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:47,400
MARISHA: So tired.

1740
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:54,358
LAURA: I look at the guards. I mean, are you guys
tired? I mean, how do you even know what fucking

1741
02:05:54,358 --> 02:05:56,032
time it is, right?

1742
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:57,218
MARISHA: Right?

1743
02:05:57,218 --> 02:05:59,754
MATT: "Do you wish to be escorted to your
quarters, then?"

1744
02:05:59,754 --> 02:06:01,859
LAURA: I would love to get some sleep.

1745
02:06:01,859 --> 02:06:07,128
MATT: "Please follow us." And they both lead on,
leading you back to the rooms you guys had set for

1746
02:06:07,128 --> 02:06:12,004
the evening's rest. Eventually you get to your
rooms, the guards stay stationed outside, and you

1747
02:06:12,004 --> 02:06:14,293
are led into your individual spaces.

1748
02:06:14,293 --> 02:06:15,408
LAURA: There's windows though, yeah?

1749
02:06:15,455 --> 02:06:16,542
MATT: Yes.

1750
02:06:16,542 --> 02:06:18,637
LIAM: And the guards leave us in our rooms,
obviously.

1751
02:06:18,637 --> 02:06:19,639
MATT: Yes.

1752
02:06:19,639 --> 02:06:21,511
MARISHA: So wait, are we all in our own individual
rooms?

1753
02:06:21,511 --> 02:06:24,793
TALIESIN: We have earrings, we could just talk on
the earrings.

1754
02:06:24,793 --> 02:06:26,185
MATT: You all go into a room together, then.

1755
02:06:26,185 --> 02:06:27,863
LAURA: Super duper happy, all together.

1756
02:06:27,863 --> 02:06:31,666
MATT: You have four rooms at your disposal and you
all say, we're going to go sleep, and all go into

1757
02:06:31,666 --> 02:06:33,485
one room with a broken bed.

1758
02:06:33,485 --> 02:06:35,918
SAM: We're a close-knit family.

1759
02:06:35,918 --> 02:06:37,549
LIAM: You can make your own assumptions.

1760
02:06:37,549 --> 02:06:40,811
MARISHA: We can go into our own rooms and I can
fix it if we don't want to tip people off.

1761
02:06:40,811 --> 02:06:44,164
SAM: No, we do what we want.

1762
02:06:44,164 --> 02:06:46,030
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're fucking close, man.

1763
02:06:46,030 --> 02:06:51,288
MATT: All right, you guys all enter the largest
room where you met before, and as you all find

1764
02:06:51,288 --> 02:06:55,038
your way in there, one of the guards goes, "You're
going to sleep--"

1765
02:06:55,038 --> 02:06:58,739
MARISHA: It's for prayer. We have to pray. 
Remember, right, Grog?

1766
02:06:58,739 --> 02:07:02,077
TRAVIS: Oh yes, we're very holy.

1767
02:07:02,112 --> 02:07:07,259
LAURA: Yes, it's been quite a while. I'm rather
hungry.

1768
02:07:07,259 --> 02:07:09,368
SAM: We all sleep together; it's a polyamorous
thing.

1769
02:07:09,368 --> 02:07:13,036
(laughter)

1770
02:07:13,036 --> 02:07:15,019
TRAVIS: I told you we were holy.

1771
02:07:15,019 --> 02:07:17,618
MATT: Scanlan and Vex, make deception checks,
please.

1772
02:07:17,618 --> 02:07:18,556
LAURA: Perception?

1773
02:07:18,556 --> 02:07:19,736
MATT and LIAM: Deception.

1774
02:07:19,736 --> 02:07:24,976
LAURA: Deception. Oh. Ten?

1775
02:07:24,976 --> 02:07:28,181
SAM: 21.

1776
02:07:28,181 --> 02:07:31,703
LIAM: (cackles) That's the lie that goes through.

1777
02:07:31,703 --> 02:07:37,739
MATT: When you say you're tired and ready to rest,
the guard goes, "Mm-hm." And then when you say

1778
02:07:37,739 --> 02:07:40,188
polyamorous, the guard goes, "Oh."

1779
02:07:40,188 --> 02:07:43,363
(laughter)

1780
02:07:43,363 --> 02:07:55,838
SAM: Yeah, man. We are freak-ay.

1781
02:07:55,879 --> 02:07:59,608
LIAM: I grab Grog by the circlet thing and say,
come on, I'm tense. Let's go.

1782
02:07:59,651 --> 02:08:14,495
(laughter)

1783
02:08:14,495 --> 02:08:21,056
MATT: The two guards, the two guards look at each
other and take two steps away from the room.

1784
02:08:21,056 --> 02:08:24,555
"We'll keep a close watch."

1785
02:08:24,555 --> 02:08:29,095
MARISHA: Keyleth says, we're totally
polyamorous--

1786
02:08:29,095 --> 02:08:30,425
TALIESIN: You! No!

1787
02:08:30,425 --> 02:08:40,990
MARISHA: And I turn Percy and Vax into squirrels
with Polymorph. See? Polyamorous.

1788
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:44,845
MATT: The two guards look at each other, very
disturbed and say, "You've already shared too

1789
02:08:44,845 --> 02:08:56,663
"much, we don't judge, just please go 'sleep'." They
both hold their blades at the ready, both just

1790
02:08:56,703 --> 02:09:02,628
like, "What is my life right now?" All right.

1791
02:09:02,628 --> 02:09:05,270
SAM: We may need you to clean up for us later.

1792
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:18,160
MATT: "Please! Go! Sleep!" You guys are now closed
off inside your room.

1793
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:19,514
LAURA: And the squirrels.

1794
02:09:19,514 --> 02:09:21,438
MATT: As squirrels. What are you going to do?

1795
02:09:21,438 --> 02:09:27,204
MARISHA: Okay, I drop Polymorph. That's what
polyamorous means, right, guys?

1796
02:09:27,204 --> 02:09:28,138
TALIESIN: Yes.

1797
02:09:28,138 --> 02:09:29,340
MARISHA: Okay.

1798
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:31,971
SAM: Garmelie, show thyself.

1799
02:09:31,971 --> 02:09:34,618
MATT: He appears and goes like, "Was that true?"

1800
02:09:34,618 --> 02:09:46,432
(laughter)

1801
02:09:46,432 --> 02:09:49,956
MATT: He has his sketchbook at the ready and is
like, "Because I mean..."

1802
02:09:49,956 --> 02:09:51,941
TALIESIN: No. No.

1803
02:09:51,941 --> 02:09:55,381
SAM: You don't know.

1804
02:09:55,381 --> 02:10:05,365
MATT: "Well." He closes the book. "So. I believe
someone here took a hat?"

1805
02:10:05,365 --> 02:10:15,230
LIAM: I might have a hat for you. The other
adventure didn't turn out so well, and I really

1806
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:20,681
want to give you this hat. I'm wondering-- fuck
it, I don't have anything to say, take the fucking hat.

1807
02:10:20,681 --> 02:10:27,791
MATT: And he puts it on. It's a little small. But
he goes, "Ah, it's fine." Smiles back.

1808
02:10:27,832 --> 02:10:29,766
LIAM: So worth it.

1809
02:10:29,766 --> 02:10:32,568
LAURA: Yeah. That was definitely worth it.

1810
02:10:32,568 --> 02:10:39,399
MATT: He seems extremely proud and happy that this
hat is now in his possession. "One of two. Now,

1811
02:10:39,399 --> 02:10:41,261
"the second part."

1812
02:10:41,261 --> 02:10:43,751
SAM: Any ideas there, Garmelie?

1813
02:10:43,751 --> 02:10:45,157
MATT: "No."

1814
02:10:45,157 --> 02:10:49,334
LAURA: You passed by those threshold crests
several times, I'm assuming.

1815
02:10:49,334 --> 02:10:54,614
TALIESIN: Let me get this straight, Garmelie. You
require of us a piece of a threshold crest.

1816
02:10:54,614 --> 02:10:55,538
MATT: "Yes."

1817
02:10:55,538 --> 02:10:56,692
TALIESIN: Any threshold crest.

1818
02:10:56,692 --> 02:10:57,475
MATT: "Yes!"

1819
02:10:57,475 --> 02:10:58,841
TALIESIN: Just as long as it's a threshold crest.

1820
02:10:58,841 --> 02:10:59,674
MATT: "Yes!"

1821
02:10:59,674 --> 02:11:00,810
MARISHA: And looks like a crest.

1822
02:11:00,810 --> 02:11:01,773
TALIESIN: It's a threshold crest.

1823
02:11:01,773 --> 02:11:02,743
MATT: "A threshold crest."

1824
02:11:02,743 --> 02:11:05,380
TALIESIN: Okay, Keyleth. The thing we talked
about.

1825
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:12,290
MARISHA: And I start casting Stone Shape right
under the threshold of the door to the room that

1826
02:11:12,290 --> 02:11:21,800
we're in, and I cut out a crest from the
threshold.

1827
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:23,811
MATT: What crest do you create? What does it look
like?

1828
02:11:23,811 --> 02:11:32,683
MARISHA: A Whitestone crest. From the threshold of
the door.

1829
02:11:32,683 --> 02:11:34,927
TALIESIN: We break it.

1830
02:11:34,927 --> 02:11:39,476
MARISHA: There's a piece of your threshold crest.

1831
02:11:39,476 --> 02:11:48,549
(laughing and cheering)

1832
02:11:48,549 --> 02:11:51,405
TALIESIN: Don't cast Friends on people. It's not
nice.

1833
02:11:51,405 --> 02:11:56,760
MATT: You watch as his ears, his pointed ears
slowly slink back and his hair stands up all

1834
02:11:56,760 --> 02:12:03,131
across the back of his head, his beard almost
bristles out into spines as the hat goes (poink)

1835
02:12:03,131 --> 02:12:07,566
and pops off and hits the ground. He snatches it
up. Grabs the piece.

1836
02:12:07,566 --> 02:12:12,017
TALIESIN: That's your threshold crest. Piece of a
threshold crest.

1837
02:12:12,017 --> 02:12:14,123
MATT: "Thank you."

1838
02:12:14,123 --> 02:12:15,510
LAURA: Yay!

1839
02:12:15,510 --> 02:12:21,611
MATT: "Well, it appears that our deal has been
kept."

1840
02:12:21,611 --> 02:12:31,557
(laughing and cheering)

1841
02:12:31,557 --> 02:12:42,389
MATT: He snaps his fingers and you feel like this
sudden, this almost unnoticeable pressure at the

1842
02:12:42,389 --> 02:12:51,218
base of your neck that you had felt since you made
the deal release and absolve, on both of you. "All

1843
02:12:51,218 --> 02:13:01,376
"right, so. Well, at least I got the hat out of it.
So. The Shademirk, then? Come, follow me, grab

1844
02:13:01,376 --> 02:13:02,980
"your things." (laughs)

1845
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:04,515
MARISHA: Let's go.

1846
02:13:04,515 --> 02:13:06,563
TALIESIN: I cannot wait.

1847
02:13:06,563 --> 02:13:13,660
MATT: "Now." He vanishes. And Grog, you feel a
little tug on your finger to pull you forward.

1848
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:14,944
TRAVIS: I fart.

1849
02:13:14,944 --> 02:13:20,127
(laughter)

1850
02:13:20,127 --> 02:13:29,814
MATT: "I had that coming. We now have even more of
a reason to make haste. This is a very small room,

1851
02:13:29,814 --> 02:13:36,709
"and I've been following behind him for quite some
time. Let's go. Now, quickly." And you see Grog

1852
02:13:36,709 --> 02:13:40,453
being pulled forward by the finger, and you guys
get the feeling that he's leading you out of the

1853
02:13:40,453 --> 02:13:42,922
city, invisible, by Grog's finger.

1854
02:13:42,922 --> 02:13:49,202
TRAVIS: We're going this way. Follow me, chaps!

1855
02:13:49,202 --> 02:13:50,673
MARISHA: Follow the finger.

1856
02:13:50,673 --> 02:13:52,303
SAM: Are the guards following?

1857
02:13:52,303 --> 02:13:54,504
MATT: The two guards are following, yes.

1858
02:13:54,504 --> 02:13:57,476
LAURA: Woo, that was really fun.

1859
02:13:57,476 --> 02:13:59,845
MARISHA: My hair is messed up.

1860
02:13:59,845 --> 02:14:01,377
SAM: Good sesh.

1861
02:14:01,377 --> 02:14:03,531
LAURA: Good. That was really...

1862
02:14:03,531 --> 02:14:04,943
LIAM: Thanks, Grog.

1863
02:14:04,943 --> 02:14:16,541
(laughter)

1864
02:14:16,541 --> 02:14:21,463
LIAM: I feel loose as a goose. Let's go see this
bog.

1865
02:14:21,463 --> 02:14:26,227
MARISHA: And I transform into a goose and come out
as a goose.

1866
02:14:26,227 --> 02:14:36,942
MATT: "You-- (frustrated noise) Never mind." The
guards follow at a very healthy distance now, both

1867
02:14:36,942 --> 02:14:39,903
whispering to each other as they watch you walk.

1868
02:14:39,903 --> 02:14:45,349
LAURA: I think we made a really good impression on
this city coming back.

1869
02:14:45,349 --> 02:14:49,187
TRAVIS: I'm going to kill you later.

1870
02:14:49,187 --> 02:14:54,706
MATT: You guys are led back through the main
portion of Syngorn, towards the front gates where

1871
02:14:54,706 --> 02:15:00,112
the watchers reside. The doors are opened for you,
and you are escorted out the front gate, where the

1872
02:15:00,112 --> 02:15:08,469
guards very happily leave you to be. And both turn
around at each other and go, (heavy sigh) and they

1873
02:15:08,469 --> 02:15:13,490
walk back inside the confines of the outer
Syngorean wall. You guys are now back out in the

1874
02:15:13,490 --> 02:15:21,749
wilds of Syngorn, the finger tugs lead you out
past the front of the city, through the marshlike

1875
02:15:21,749 --> 02:15:27,915
mandrake fields that you initially traversed when
you made your way to Syngorn, and then find your

1876
02:15:27,915 --> 02:15:33,105
way back into the Ever-Shifting Grasses, heading
duskward, towards where

1877
02:15:33,105 --> 02:15:35,125
it seems the dusk sun will set.

1878
02:15:35,125 --> 02:15:36,337
LAURA: Duskward.

1879
02:15:36,337 --> 02:15:37,293
TALIESIN: Duskward.

1880
02:15:37,293 --> 02:15:38,718
MARISHA: Always duskward.

1881
02:15:38,718 --> 02:15:40,829
SAM: I hate that direction.

1882
02:15:40,829 --> 02:15:43,816
MATT: There's also nightward, seaward, or
tangleward. Which would you prefer?

1883
02:15:43,816 --> 02:15:45,056
SAM: Are those different directions?

1884
02:15:45,056 --> 02:15:47,172
MATT: Yes, those are different directions.

1885
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:49,054
LAURA: Tangleward? Did you say tangleward?

1886
02:15:49,054 --> 02:15:50,805
MATT: Tangleward. It was mentioned before, yeah.

1887
02:15:50,805 --> 02:15:55,475
LAURA: Oh. I just thought of the Disney movie and
I think I spaced out there.

1888
02:15:55,475 --> 02:15:59,862
MATT: I'm pretty sure that the people in the
Feywild haven't seen that. Not yet. They're

1889
02:15:59,862 --> 02:16:05,275
waiting for it to come out on Blu-Ray. All right.
So you make your way towards where the grasses get

1890
02:16:05,275 --> 02:16:12,181
heavy again, and you see Garmelie (foosh) once
again take visible form again and be like, "Ah, sorry,

1891
02:16:12,181 --> 02:16:19,890
"that concentration for a while really gets to you,
I'm so glad to be out of that stuffy place. So!

1892
02:16:19,890 --> 02:16:25,915
"Shall we?" Rights his hat. And even in righting
it, it's a little crooked to one side and he

1893
02:16:25,915 --> 02:16:28,396
begins marching duskward.

1894
02:16:28,396 --> 02:16:30,309
LAURA: Onward to the theater!

1895
02:16:30,309 --> 02:16:35,333
MATT: "No! No theater! We are avoiding the
theater! No."

1896
02:16:35,333 --> 02:16:40,300
TRAVIS: Garmelie, how far of a journey is it to
this bog?

1897
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:45,476
MATT: "Say about four times since we met?"

1898
02:16:45,476 --> 02:16:47,326
LAURA: Okay.

1899
02:16:47,326 --> 02:16:49,134
TRAVIS: That doesn't mean anything to me.

1900
02:16:49,134 --> 02:16:50,913
LAURA: Four times since we met.

1901
02:16:50,913 --> 02:16:55,988
LIAM: I'm just curious, why are you so worried
about the theater? I love the theater.

1902
02:16:55,988 --> 02:16:59,971
MATT: "I have my reasons." And he continues
walking forward.

1903
02:16:59,971 --> 02:17:03,223
LIAM: Thanks, great. Good talk.

1904
02:17:03,223 --> 02:17:05,255
LAURA: It's been 14 hours since we've met.

1905
02:17:05,255 --> 02:17:10,160
SAM: Can we travel any faster than that? Can we
mist, can we tree, can we...?

1906
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:16,330
LAURA: Wait a minute, you could-- if you know a
tree is-- that would be pretty stupid, to just pop

1907
02:17:16,330 --> 02:17:23,342
out of the cancerous tree, but if we know a tree
is there, couldn't you potentially

1908
02:17:23,342 --> 02:17:25,111
just fucking do it?

1909
02:17:25,111 --> 02:17:29,441
LIAM: You've had a lot of good ideas. That's not
one of them. That's a bad idea.

1910
02:17:29,441 --> 02:17:30,925
MARISHA: She's not wrong.

1911
02:17:30,925 --> 02:17:34,730
LAURA: Wait! Keyleth, what if you just open up the
cancerous tree, we reach through, we grab the

1912
02:17:34,730 --> 02:17:37,019
fucking bow, and then we're out.

1913
02:17:37,019 --> 02:17:44,103
MARISHA: Well, you're not entirely wrong, I don't
know if I can Teleport via Plants because

1914
02:17:44,103 --> 02:17:55,349
generally that takes knowing the plant. However, I
do have Tree Stride, which means we can-- nope,

1915
02:17:55,349 --> 02:17:58,168
never mind, I can only do that on myself.

1916
02:17:58,168 --> 02:17:59,563
MATT: Wah-wah.

1917
02:17:59,563 --> 02:18:09,681
TALIESIN: We are not sending Keyleth the goose
into a bog to retrieve a bow from an angry

1918
02:18:09,681 --> 02:18:11,513
cancerous tree.

1919
02:18:11,513 --> 02:18:13,416
MARISHA: But I'm loosey! I'm a loosey goose.

1920
02:18:13,416 --> 02:18:15,922
MATT: That would look amazing on an epitaph, I'm
just saying.

1921
02:18:15,965 --> 02:18:17,934
MARISHA: We can mist there.

1922
02:18:17,934 --> 02:18:20,176
SAM: Would that save time, I don't remember how
fast we go.

1923
02:18:20,176 --> 02:18:21,778
MARISHA: I might have to take a hot nap.

1924
02:18:21,778 --> 02:18:23,511
TRAVIS: A hot nap?

1925
02:18:23,511 --> 02:18:24,706
MARISHA: Yeah.

1926
02:18:24,706 --> 02:18:26,475
MATT: Didn't you guys just take a hot nap?

1927
02:18:26,475 --> 02:18:35,341
(laughter)

1928
02:18:35,341 --> 02:18:41,854
MARISHA: Yeah. The answer is yes. I can do all those
things.

1929
02:18:41,854 --> 02:18:45,396
TALIESIN: Well, let's travel for a bit and then
we'll take a proper break.

1930
02:18:45,396 --> 02:18:48,845
MARISHA: If we can get to the edge of the bog,
then we'll take a sleep.

1931
02:18:48,845 --> 02:18:52,486
LAURA: Wait, I think the edge of the bog is kind
of far, though.

1932
02:18:52,486 --> 02:18:56,557
TALIESIN: We'll start our journey, and the next
leg of our journey.

1933
02:18:56,557 --> 02:18:57,675
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's get going.

1934
02:18:57,675 --> 02:18:59,122
MARISHA: We'll go until we're tired.

1935
02:18:59,122 --> 02:19:01,756
MATT: "I like the sound of that."

1936
02:19:01,756 --> 02:19:03,906
LAURA: Oh. (belches)

1937
02:19:03,906 --> 02:19:15,405
(laughing and cheering)

1938
02:19:15,405 --> 02:19:18,203
MATT: "Most impressive for a lady."

1939
02:19:18,203 --> 02:19:22,591
LAURA: Thank you. That's a baroness burp.

1940
02:19:22,591 --> 02:19:25,913
MARISHA: Robert Durst shit.

1941
02:19:25,913 --> 02:19:34,922
MATT: As you guys push on further northward at the
behest of Garmelie, you push for another two hours

1942
02:19:34,922 --> 02:19:40,421
or so through the Ever-Shifting Grasses, and as
you get further and further north, the color of

1943
02:19:40,421 --> 02:19:47,331
the grass seems to go from that deep verdant green
to almost a maroon purplish color.

1944
02:19:47,331 --> 02:19:51,134
LAURA: I pop Trinket out of the necklace.

1945
02:19:51,134 --> 02:19:53,402
MATT: He attacks some of the grass and chews it
up.

1946
02:19:53,402 --> 02:19:54,471
LAURA: Yeah, get it!

1947
02:19:54,471 --> 02:19:59,208
MARISHA: Don't touch the grass, it'll get angry at
you! It'll yell at you for a week!

1948
02:19:59,208 --> 02:20:01,106
TRAVIS: I don't think that applies here.

1949
02:20:01,106 --> 02:20:06,643
LAURA: It's okay, darling. It's okay. Keyleth.

1950
02:20:06,643 --> 02:20:07,516
MARISHA: What?

1951
02:20:07,516 --> 02:20:09,196
LAURA: Do not yell at my bear.

1952
02:20:09,196 --> 02:20:10,817
MARISHA: I was just trying to protect him.

1953
02:20:10,817 --> 02:20:12,332
LIAM: I give him some grass.

1954
02:20:12,332 --> 02:20:13,349
MARISHA: Don't!

1955
02:20:13,349 --> 02:20:14,420
SAM: It's fine.

1956
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:15,653
TALIESIN: It's fine.

1957
02:20:15,653 --> 02:20:19,913
MATT: And just keeps going forward through the
grass fields.

1958
02:20:19,913 --> 02:20:21,806
MARISHA: Does the grass seem angry?

1959
02:20:21,806 --> 02:20:23,445
MATT: No, it just seems to be changing color.

1960
02:20:23,445 --> 02:20:25,395
MARISHA: Suck it, grass!

1961
02:20:25,395 --> 02:20:31,251
MATT: As you say that, the grass goes from a
purplish color to a deep, deep red around you.

1962
02:20:31,251 --> 02:20:32,615
SAM: Oh god.

1963
02:20:32,615 --> 02:20:41,343
MARISHA: Because you... suck out the joy of all of
us living around you, and you're so amazing.

1964
02:20:41,343 --> 02:20:42,662
TRAVIS: That makes it even worse.

1965
02:20:42,662 --> 02:20:43,534
SAM: Not a compliment.

1966
02:20:43,534 --> 02:20:44,719
TRAVIS: You're still going in the same direction.

1967
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:47,833
MARISHA: I mean, you suck out bad--

1968
02:20:47,833 --> 02:20:51,008
LIAM: I grab Keyleth's hand. Let's take a walk.

1969
02:20:51,008 --> 02:20:54,506
MATT: All of you, as you're walking, the actual
grasses around you are getting more and more dense

1970
02:20:54,506 --> 02:20:57,890
and are catching on your feet and you're finding
that your progression

1971
02:20:57,890 --> 02:20:59,681
is getting slower and slower.

1972
02:20:59,681 --> 02:21:06,487
LAURA: Wait, no. I have Landstride, which means I
don't slow against any land.

1973
02:21:06,487 --> 02:21:10,990
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine, you just coast ahead.
The rest of the party, it's like they're going

1974
02:21:10,990 --> 02:21:16,495
through waist-high thickets. The grass looks
gentle, but as soon as it hits your body, it rakes

1975
02:21:16,495 --> 02:21:22,000
across it almost like very fine serrated plants,
and it's catching on your clothing and pulling you

1976
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,502
back. It's almost like since those statements were
made...

1977
02:21:24,502 --> 02:21:30,740
(laughter)

1978
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:36,112
TRAVIS: I have a hooded lantern. I could set this
whole fucking thing ablaze.

1979
02:21:36,112 --> 02:21:37,583
ALL: No!

1980
02:21:37,583 --> 02:21:42,112
MATT: The red goes to a deep cinder-like red.

1981
02:21:42,112 --> 02:21:44,236
SAM: Are we going to have roll initiative on
grass?

1982
02:21:44,236 --> 02:21:46,736
LAURA: No, wait.

1983
02:21:46,736 --> 02:21:49,751
TALIESIN: Does no one-- I'm going to take a
moment.

1984
02:21:49,751 --> 02:21:51,907
MARISHA: I feel like the grass feels our
emotions.

1985
02:21:51,907 --> 02:21:55,841
SAM: Your emotions. Because you yelled at it.

1986
02:21:55,841 --> 02:22:02,834
TALIESIN: Lovely field, I apologize for the
rudeness of my compatriots. We will be gentle

1987
02:22:02,834 --> 02:22:08,672
trouncing through you. We will make as little mark
as we can and enjoy the splendor of your

1988
02:22:08,672 --> 02:22:17,218
ever-changing colors. You are majestic, you are
windswept-- I'm flirting with grass-- you are

1989
02:22:17,218 --> 02:22:20,665
everything I could hope for in a beautiful view.

1990
02:22:20,665 --> 02:22:21,948
SAM: I sing a song.

1991
02:22:21,948 --> 02:22:23,152
MATT: What do you sing?

1992
02:22:23,152 --> 02:22:27,415
(cheering)

1993
02:22:27,415 --> 02:22:39,028
SAM: (singing) Keep growing. Keep flowing, knowing
you can always count on me.

1994
02:22:39,028 --> 02:22:41,694
TRAVIS, LAURA, and SAM: (singing) For sure.

1995
02:22:41,694 --> 02:22:43,886
SAM: (singing) That's what Scanlan's for.

1996
02:22:43,886 --> 02:22:49,939
(cheering)

1997
02:22:49,939 --> 02:22:53,401
MATT: Percy, I want you to make a persuasion check
against the grass?

1998
02:22:53,401 --> 02:22:58,899
Adding the d10 inspiration die.

1999
02:22:58,899 --> 02:23:01,251
TALIESIN: Oh, d10 inspiration. Come on.

2000
02:23:01,251 --> 02:23:02,635
MARISHA: I do an interpretive dance.

2001
02:23:02,635 --> 02:23:04,252
SAM: Come on, persuade that plant.

2002
02:23:04,252 --> 02:23:05,720
TALIESIN: That was leaning.

2003
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:07,252
SAM: That was a leaner.

2004
02:23:07,252 --> 02:23:14,326
TALIESIN: That jumped, but that's still fine,
okay, it's. Persuasion check? Oh yeah, that's not

2005
02:23:14,326 --> 02:23:17,826
bad. 24.

2006
02:23:17,826 --> 02:23:19,402
MATT: What was it?

2007
02:23:19,402 --> 02:23:25,352
TALIESIN: Eight plus six plus seven. (counting)
21.

2008
02:23:25,352 --> 02:23:27,906
SAM: It's more than that.

2009
02:23:27,906 --> 02:23:33,695
MATT: Between the interpretive dance of Keyleth
amongst the tattered angry grasses, the beautiful

2010
02:23:33,831 --> 02:23:40,567
vocal stylings of Scanlan Shorthalt, and Percy
speaking out a wondrous poem towards the

2011
02:23:40,567 --> 02:23:48,376
Ever-Shifting Grasses, you watch as the deep
bright red subsides into the relaxed purple, and

2012
02:23:48,376 --> 02:23:53,982
eventually goes back to a dull green, and you find
your traveling no longer impeded as it once was.

2013
02:23:53,982 --> 02:23:54,987
LAURA: Yeah.

2014
02:23:54,987 --> 02:23:56,114
MATT: Good job!

2015
02:23:56,114 --> 02:23:57,522
LAURA: Good job!

2016
02:23:57,522 --> 02:24:03,346
MATT: You successfully parlayed with a field.

2017
02:24:03,346 --> 02:24:07,107
TRAVIS: First doors, then grass.

2018
02:24:07,107 --> 02:24:12,607
LIAM: Don't talk shit to grass!

2019
02:24:12,607 --> 02:24:16,007
SAM: How do you want to mow this?

2020
02:24:16,007 --> 02:24:23,643
(laughter)

2021
02:24:23,643 --> 02:24:32,223
MATT: So. About another half an hour of travel
before in the distance ahead of you can see the

2022
02:24:32,223 --> 02:24:37,872
dark edge of what looks to be another forest ahead
of you, wide and almost end-to-end, you see it. A

2023
02:24:37,872 --> 02:24:41,913
lot of these wooded areas almost meet the horizon,
it's like you're stepping into just an endless

2024
02:24:41,913 --> 02:24:49,161
wall of trees. As you begin to approach closer to
the edge, Garmelie looks up and says, "All right.

2025
02:24:49,161 --> 02:24:55,930
"So we have choices now. We have the Moonbrush
before us, or we have the Green Sea, which is far

2026
02:24:55,930 --> 02:24:59,094
"seaward of here. I would recommend the
Moonbrush."

2027
02:24:59,094 --> 02:25:03,486
SAM: Then we should go the other way. Because we
don't trust a fucking thing you say.

2028
02:25:03,523 --> 02:25:04,898
MATT: "Very well."

2029
02:25:04,898 --> 02:25:06,318
LAURA: Wait.

2030
02:25:06,318 --> 02:25:08,059
TALIESIN: No, the High Warden did say--

2031
02:25:08,059 --> 02:25:09,538
MARISHA: -- to avoid the Green Sea.

2032
02:25:09,538 --> 02:25:11,854
LAURA: Why do you recommend the Moonbrush?

2033
02:25:11,854 --> 02:25:15,460
MATT: "Because it's the only real route to get to
the Gilded Run."

2034
02:25:15,460 --> 02:25:17,065
LAURA: What is the Gilded Run?

2035
02:25:17,065 --> 02:25:18,866
MATT: "The Gilded Run are the rivers that surround
it."

2036
02:25:18,866 --> 02:25:20,351
LAURA: Right, those.

2037
02:25:20,351 --> 02:25:26,258
MATT: "Yes. You're looking for the Shademirk. You
have to get through the Gilded Run to get the

2038
02:25:26,258 --> 02:25:29,724
"Shademirk. You have to go through the Moonbrush to
get to the Gilded Run."

2039
02:25:29,724 --> 02:25:30,925
LIAM: Where's the theater?

2040
02:25:30,925 --> 02:25:34,715
MATT: "No theater!"

2041
02:25:34,715 --> 02:25:40,536
TRAVIS: Right, so we're going through the brushy
moon?

2042
02:25:40,536 --> 02:25:42,303
MATT: "Yes! Come, come."

2043
02:25:42,303 --> 02:25:44,021
LAURA: Yeah? Are you okay with that, Scanlan?

2044
02:25:44,021 --> 02:25:46,135
SAM: I'll allow it.

2045
02:25:46,135 --> 02:25:49,300
MARISHA: How long have we been awake?

2046
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:56,242
MATT: You are... you've been awake for about 12
hours now, I'd say.

2047
02:25:56,242 --> 02:26:04,776
MARISHA: If we want to mist there, then we have to
sleep. But we'll press on for a few more hours.

2048
02:26:04,776 --> 02:26:09,309
MATT: Certainly. About another 40 minutes of foot
travel before you begin to hit the edge of the

2049
02:26:09,309 --> 02:26:15,614
Moonbrush Forest. As you approach, Garmelie says,
"All right, so things you should know about the

2050
02:26:15,614 --> 02:26:21,097
"Moonbrush. One: it is home to a number of
denizens." And as you look overhead, you can see

2051
02:26:21,097 --> 02:26:28,267
it's a thick fog that permeates the entirety of
this forest. You can see the outline of every tree

2052
02:26:28,267 --> 02:26:34,003
trunk towards the outer rim of this entire brush.
The canopy of the trees themselves are like long

2053
02:26:34,003 --> 02:26:40,665
weeping willows that sag and give this very
ominous feeling to the entire forest. You can see

2054
02:26:40,665 --> 02:26:45,777
small mountain spires breaking through portions of
the tree line in the distance occasionally, miles

2055
02:26:45,777 --> 02:26:55,711
between each other, sometimes a cluster far closer
together. He says, "There is a clan of sorts that

2056
02:26:55,711 --> 02:27:01,254
"lives amongst the forest, we'll try our best to
avoid. They are natural hunters and they are of

2057
02:27:01,254 --> 02:27:06,307
"the lycan persuasion."

2058
02:27:06,307 --> 02:27:08,941
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh.

2059
02:27:08,941 --> 02:27:19,050
MATT: "So, best that we avoid interaction. They
are well-read, they have a society; we should

2060
02:27:19,050 --> 02:27:20,652
"touch none of it."

2061
02:27:20,652 --> 02:27:26,832
MARISHA: Question. You mentioned we are going into
the Moonbrush with lycan hunters?

2062
02:27:26,832 --> 02:27:28,596
MATT: "Yes. It's a necessity."

2063
02:27:28,596 --> 02:27:31,337
MARISHA: Yeah, no, it sounds like it. Yeah.

2064
02:27:31,337 --> 02:27:37,526
MATT: "Yes. But they do have natural enemies.
There is a faction of pixies that live within,

2065
02:27:37,593 --> 02:27:43,811
"known as the Wishers, and they are forever locked
in a struggle. So avoid both, do not get involved

2066
02:27:43,849 --> 02:27:46,148
"at all, and we'll be fine."

2067
02:27:46,148 --> 02:27:55,713
LAURA: Do the lycan tend to populate trees, or if
we stay up high can we maybe avoid them?

2068
02:27:55,713 --> 02:27:58,929
MATT: "Actually, they travel mostly in the trees.
That's the easiest way for them

2069
02:27:58,929 --> 02:28:00,211
"to hunt, is unseen."

2070
02:28:00,211 --> 02:28:01,622
LAURA: Well, there you go.

2071
02:28:01,622 --> 02:28:13,205
MATT: "They are ruled by a singular lycan lord,
who goes by the name of Ukurat."

2072
02:28:13,205 --> 02:28:14,241
MARISHA: What?

2073
02:28:14,241 --> 02:28:15,842
SAM: Ulurat?

2074
02:28:15,842 --> 02:28:16,871
MATT: "Ukurat."

2075
02:28:16,871 --> 02:28:17,967
MARISHA: Ukurat.

2076
02:28:17,967 --> 02:28:20,839
LAURA: Ukurat or Udurat?

2077
02:28:20,839 --> 02:28:21,869
MATT: "Ukurat."

2078
02:28:21,869 --> 02:28:22,801
LAURA and LIAM: Ukurat.

2079
02:28:22,801 --> 02:28:26,054
MATT: "U-K-U-R-A-T."

2080
02:28:26,054 --> 02:28:27,521
TRAVIS: Bob.

2081
02:28:27,521 --> 02:28:29,496
MATT: "He is to also be avoided."

2082
02:28:29,496 --> 02:28:31,630
TALIESIN: Is that an elven name? Is that an elven
word?

2083
02:28:31,630 --> 02:28:33,175
MATT: "It was, once."

2084
02:28:33,175 --> 02:28:37,397
LAURA: Wait, he used to be elven? He used to be
elven.

2085
02:28:37,397 --> 02:28:42,667
MATT: "They all used to be many things. He
happened to be elven at one time, yes? So. Anyway.

2086
02:28:42,667 --> 02:28:45,776
"We'll avoid them, and avoid the Wishers, and also
those things,

2087
02:28:45,776 --> 02:28:48,000
"the little plants that you saw before?"

2088
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,887
LAURA: Mandrakes?

2089
02:28:48,887 --> 02:28:50,792
MATT: "Mandrakes? Also everywhere. Avoid them."

2090
02:28:50,792 --> 02:28:51,985
LAURA: Okay.

2091
02:28:51,985 --> 02:28:57,292
MATT: "And we'll just avoid the other things I
mentioned, so. Shall we?" And he begins to step

2092
02:28:57,292 --> 02:28:58,942
and march up to the edge of the Moonbrush.

2093
02:28:58,942 --> 02:29:01,137
TALIESIN: Okay.

2094
02:29:01,137 --> 02:29:04,120
SAM: It's fine. We've killed dragons, we'll be fine.

2095
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:06,247
TRAVIS: I'm so stoked right now.

2096
02:29:06,247 --> 02:29:12,054
MARISHA: Did we-- okay, yeah. Sure. Yeah.

2097
02:29:12,054 --> 02:29:20,742
MATT: All right. You guys make your way into the
dark Moonbrush itself and as you walk into the

2098
02:29:20,742 --> 02:29:27,467
forest, immediately you can hear the swell of
distant crickets, thousands upon thousands,

2099
02:29:27,467 --> 02:29:29,918
sourceless, fill the air around you.

2100
02:29:29,918 --> 02:29:32,197
SAM: Audience, please.

2101
02:29:32,197 --> 02:29:35,056
(cricket noises, laughter)

2102
02:29:35,056 --> 02:29:38,520
MATT: That works, I was going to look for cricket
sounds here. That's also totally doable.

2103
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:41,797
MARISHA: Someone's got a really good one.

2104
02:29:41,797 --> 02:29:49,430
MATT: As you walk in, the actual dusk light that
has permeated the Feywild begins to give way to

2105
02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:54,515
the first signs of night. You can look up through
the different breaks in the tree line, you can see

2106
02:29:54,515 --> 02:29:59,877
stars for the first time. And you can see what
looks to be a very dull white glow of moonlight

2107
02:29:59,877 --> 02:30:06,900
hitting some of the trees and breaking through
some of the treetops themselves. The underbrush

2108
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:17,059
itself is very soft and spongy, with a lot of
leaves that have fallen and given this soft setup.

2109
02:30:17,059 --> 02:30:26,511
As you guys push forward for another half-hour or
so, you in particular, Vex'ahlia, come upon what

2110
02:30:26,511 --> 02:30:35,224
looks to be a series of stones, what looks to be a
series of small structures, almost. Not like

2111
02:30:35,224 --> 02:30:46,298
buildings per se, but intently placed obelisks of
raw, rough stone. And as you come across and look

2112
02:30:46,298 --> 02:30:49,620
on that side, you can see what looks to be the
base of one of the mountain spires that sticks

2113
02:30:49,691 --> 02:30:51,306
out, a large cave.

2114
02:30:51,306 --> 02:30:54,808
LAURA: Do I see any kind of markings on the
obelisks?

2115
02:30:54,808 --> 02:31:00,380
MATT: Make a perception check.

2116
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:04,604
LAURA: Oh. Get out of here!

2117
02:31:04,604 --> 02:31:06,561
MATT: What'd you get?

2118
02:31:06,561 --> 02:31:07,398
LAURA: Natural one.

2119
02:31:07,398 --> 02:31:08,468
MATT: Natural one.

2120
02:31:08,468 --> 02:31:09,820
LAURA: I know!

2121
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:16,740
MATT: They just look rough and old. They've been
placed there. It's old magic.

2122
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:19,622
LIAM: God, you're so bad at D&amp;D!

2123
02:31:19,622 --> 02:31:21,000
LAURA: I suck!

2124
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:25,889
MATT: But you do see around the ground right out
in front of this cave what appears to be hundreds

2125
02:31:25,889 --> 02:31:32,988
and hundreds of small objects, piles, what looks
like fruits and flowers and bones and stone

2126
02:31:32,988 --> 02:31:36,578
carvings, all sorts of things placed in front of
this cave.

2127
02:31:36,578 --> 02:31:40,042
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check on one of the
bones to see if I can identify

2128
02:31:40,042 --> 02:31:41,386
where it came from?

2129
02:31:41,386 --> 02:31:44,580
MATT: Okay. So you head out and take one of the
bones and look at it.

2130
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:45,835
Go ahead and make a nature check.

2131
02:31:45,835 --> 02:31:49,759
MARISHA: Yeah, the closest bone, I don't want to,
ooh. Yeah.

2132
02:31:49,759 --> 02:31:51,809
TALIESIN: That ain't nothing to sneeze at.

2133
02:31:51,809 --> 02:31:54,609
MARISHA: No, it's not. 28.

2134
02:31:54,609 --> 02:32:03,901
MATT: 28. This bone belongs to a larger bird, like
a great eagle, you can't quite specifically make out

2135
02:32:03,901 --> 02:32:07,764
what it is, but it's been carved with
small letters into it of a language you can't

2136
02:32:07,807 --> 02:32:12,262
understand. It looks like it's some sort of a
ritual item that's been placed there in the

2137
02:32:12,262 --> 02:32:15,514
ground. But as you pick up and make this moment
noticed--

2138
02:32:15,514 --> 02:32:17,509
LIAM: I'm going stealth just because.

2139
02:32:17,509 --> 02:32:21,337
MATT: You all hear a giant, echoing roar coming
from the cave.

2140
02:32:21,337 --> 02:32:22,441
LIAM: Was I fast enough?

2141
02:32:22,441 --> 02:32:24,991
MATT: (roars) What'd you roll?

2142
02:32:24,991 --> 02:32:25,847
LIAM: 30.

2143
02:32:25,847 --> 02:32:32,881
MATT: 30. Okay, yeah. You just (bip) out; you are
gone. The rest of you are right at the outside of

2144
02:32:32,881 --> 02:32:37,906
this small clearing where all of these small
objects have been placed, you hear this rumbling

2145
02:32:37,906 --> 02:32:40,266
loud roar come tearing through.

2146
02:32:40,266 --> 02:32:42,885
MARISHA: I step back with the bone.

2147
02:32:42,929 --> 02:32:45,969
MATT: Okay. What are the rest of you guys doing?

2148
02:32:45,969 --> 02:32:48,024
LAURA: I pull the broom out from behind my back.

2149
02:32:48,024 --> 02:32:49,225
MATT: Okay.

2150
02:32:49,225 --> 02:32:54,229
MARISHA: Can I lean the bone over to Vex'ahlia and
be like, is this Draconic?

2151
02:32:54,229 --> 02:32:55,497
LAURA: Is it Draconic?

2152
02:32:55,497 --> 02:32:56,543
MATT: It is not Draconic.

2153
02:32:56,543 --> 02:32:58,365
MARISHA: God fucking damn it.

2154
02:32:58,365 --> 02:32:59,800
LAURA: Is it anything that I recognize, though?

2155
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:00,901
MATT: What languages do you know?

2156
02:33:00,901 --> 02:33:05,003
LAURA: Elvish, Abyssal, Undercommon.

2157
02:33:05,003 --> 02:33:06,698
MATT: No, none of those.

2158
02:33:06,698 --> 02:33:07,806
LAURA: Shit.

2159
02:33:07,806 --> 02:33:11,308
MATT: However, at this time the trees behind you
two, because the rest of you guys

2160
02:33:11,308 --> 02:33:12,274
were staying back--

2161
02:33:12,274 --> 02:33:13,346
LAURA: Who's you two?

2162
02:33:13,346 --> 02:33:19,079
MATT: Vex and Keyleth. The trees (fwoosh) shift
and close off the exterior. As you turn towards

2163
02:33:19,079 --> 02:33:25,383
the entrance of the cavern, you can see emerging
from the front a giant-- it's hard to really tell

2164
02:33:25,383 --> 02:33:32,534
the first moment that it appears, but you see what
looks to be a gargantuan dire bear-like entity

2165
02:33:32,534 --> 02:33:40,117
made of crackling blue ghostly energy, shimmering,
translucent, not actually a physical form, but

2166
02:33:40,117 --> 02:33:48,442
massive in size. (stomping noises, roar)

2167
02:33:48,442 --> 02:33:53,212
MARISHA: Wait, did we get cut off? Did Vex and I
get cut off from everybody else?

2168
02:33:53,212 --> 02:33:54,501
MATT: Yep. From everybody else.

2169
02:33:54,501 --> 02:33:57,397
LAURA: Shit! I grab Keyleth's wrist and I fly into
the air.

2170
02:33:57,397 --> 02:33:59,900
MARISHA: I hold on for dear fucking life.

2171
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:03,821
MATT: As you grab her wrist as you fly up, the
trees, swoosh, close off and you go slamming into

2172
02:34:03,821 --> 02:34:08,710
the tree boughs (crashing sound). You lose the
broom for a second. Go ahead and hold your grip.

2173
02:34:08,710 --> 02:34:11,506
Go ahead and make a strength check.

2174
02:34:11,506 --> 02:34:12,861
LAURA: A strength check!

2175
02:34:12,861 --> 02:34:14,482
SAM: We can't even see them, Matt?

2176
02:34:14,482 --> 02:34:17,132
MATT: You guys can't see them and they just closed
off in the trees.

2177
02:34:17,132 --> 02:34:24,128
LAURA: Come on! Is that a saving throw or just a
check?

2178
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:25,289
MATT: Just a check.

2179
02:34:25,289 --> 02:34:26,254
LAURA: Five.

2180
02:34:26,254 --> 02:34:32,627
MATT: Five? You lose your grip on the broom, and
both Vex and Keyleth tumble down about 20 feet,

2181
02:34:32,627 --> 02:34:37,508
you both suffer seven points of damage as you slam
into the center of another pile of what looks like

2182
02:34:37,508 --> 02:34:41,195
knick-knacks and things that are gathered on the
floor. It's at this point that your mind hits that

2183
02:34:41,195 --> 02:34:44,689
these are probably offerings, these are things
that are left as some sort of offering to this

2184
02:34:44,689 --> 02:34:50,844
bear-like spirit entity that exists in this cave.
The bear, which is now, (stomping sounds), coming

2185
02:34:50,844 --> 02:34:55,580
up towards you on the ground. Looks to Keyleth,
(roars).

2186
02:34:55,580 --> 02:34:56,582
MARISHA: Hi!

2187
02:34:56,582 --> 02:34:58,311
LAURA: I cast Speak With Animals!

2188
02:34:58,311 --> 02:34:59,434
MATT: Okay, you cast Speak With Animals.

2189
02:34:59,434 --> 02:35:00,281
LAURA: Yeah.

2190
02:35:00,281 --> 02:35:01,720
MARISHA: Like I taught you!

2191
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:03,272
LAURA: (weak growling sounds)

2192
02:35:03,272 --> 02:35:10,795
(laughter)

2193
02:35:10,795 --> 02:35:16,952
LAURA: And I say, we mean you no harm, great ghost
bear! In fact, we brought you an offering and we

2194
02:35:16,952 --> 02:35:19,934
just accidentally touched the other offering of
yours.

2195
02:35:19,934 --> 02:35:21,723
LIAM: Où est la bibliothèque?

2196
02:35:21,723 --> 02:35:23,564
(laughter)

2197
02:35:23,564 --> 02:35:26,472
LAURA: The cheese is old and moldy.

2198
02:35:26,472 --> 02:35:36,171
MATT: None of the bear's face moves at all, but an
echoing voice, in Common, not animal speak, comes

2199
02:35:36,171 --> 02:35:40,722
blasting into both of your minds, and those of you
guys outside of the trees, trying to find a way

2200
02:35:40,722 --> 02:35:51,817
through, also hear this echo, "You have entered
the domain of Orlan. You destroy and disgrace that

2201
02:35:51,860 --> 02:36:00,244
"which was gifted. What do you offer in response to
your travesty?"

2202
02:36:00,244 --> 02:36:03,158
LAURA: Yeah, well, I--

2203
02:36:03,158 --> 02:36:05,807
SAM: We have a hat. A really good hat.

2204
02:36:05,807 --> 02:36:09,482
MARISHA: I've got an old tobacco box I got from
lost and found.

2205
02:36:09,482 --> 02:36:19,208
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, that's pretty good. I offer him
a tea set.

2206
02:36:19,208 --> 02:36:27,211
MATT: As you pull the tea set out, the bear claw
reaches out and smashes it out of your hand and

2207
02:36:27,211 --> 02:36:33,667
goes scattered and breaking across one of the
stones and goes, "You walk into the realm of the

2208
02:36:33,667 --> 02:36:41,563
"wild, unwatched, unrespecting. The beasts of this
land hold no kinship with you. You will prove

2209
02:36:41,563 --> 02:36:44,692
"offering yourself." And the tongue licks the
lips.

2210
02:36:44,692 --> 02:36:51,218
MARISHA: What? I turn into a giant scorpion.

2211
02:36:51,218 --> 02:36:54,406
MATT: The scorpion takes its form, as it does the
bear, (growls).

2212
02:36:54,406 --> 02:36:58,972
MARISHA: You want an offering, you can have mine.

2213
02:36:58,972 --> 02:37:01,293
MATT: Make a persuasion check on that.

2214
02:37:01,293 --> 02:37:02,953
MARISHA: Oh god.

2215
02:37:02,953 --> 02:37:07,761
LIAM: By the way, am I hidden in or outside?

2216
02:37:07,761 --> 02:37:08,818
MATT: You're outside.

2217
02:37:08,818 --> 02:37:09,947
MARISHA: 21.

2218
02:37:09,947 --> 02:37:11,202
LAURA: Good job, Keyleth!

2219
02:37:11,202 --> 02:37:12,369
MARISHA: Thank you!

2220
02:37:12,369 --> 02:37:20,190
MATT: "I sense you have kinship with beasts. You
may pass, though I will not forgive this

2221
02:37:20,190 --> 02:37:22,503
"infraction. You."

2222
02:37:22,503 --> 02:37:23,809
LAURA: Yeah?

2223
02:37:23,809 --> 02:37:25,795
MATT: "You shall be the prize."

2224
02:37:25,795 --> 02:37:27,877
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

2225
02:37:27,877 --> 02:37:32,596
MATT: The giant bear is looming over you now, and
its size is so immense, probably 15 or 20 feet to the

2226
02:37:32,596 --> 02:37:34,397
top of its shoulders.

2227
02:37:34,397 --> 02:37:36,814
LAURA: Trinket! I call Trinket.

2228
02:37:36,863 --> 02:37:38,335
MATT: You call Trinket?

2229
02:37:38,335 --> 02:37:39,452
LAURA: I call Trinket.

2230
02:37:39,452 --> 02:37:44,222
MATT: Leaps out of your necklace and lands right
beside you and just roars, (roars) up to the

2231
02:37:44,222 --> 02:37:52,320
spirit. The spirit pulls back, (roars), roars
back. And Trinket is so tiny by comparison and is

2232
02:37:52,320 --> 02:37:57,769
up to the elbow, but Trinket lashes out at the
giant bear, just leaps up towards it, pushes into

2233
02:37:57,769 --> 02:38:02,856
it and starts tearing at its throat. The giant
bear takes Trinket with one claw and slams him

2234
02:38:02,856 --> 02:38:08,495
into the ground. Trinket rolls and gets back up,
(growls), you can see a little bit of blood at the

2235
02:38:08,495 --> 02:38:12,348
corner of its mouth, and just lunges again, this
time jumping up onto the bear's back and clawing

2236
02:38:12,348 --> 02:38:17,131
up onto its, onto the top of its torso. The bear
(growls).

2237
02:38:17,131 --> 02:38:18,950
LAURA: He's pretty cool.

2238
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:24,813
MATT: The bear head looks up at Trinket now
gnawing onto its hide, (gnawing sounds), seemingly

2239
02:38:24,813 --> 02:38:30,544
to no real effect, and the bear reaches up and
grabs Trinket and plucks him off the side and sets

2240
02:38:30,544 --> 02:38:37,869
him down next to you. The bear now begins to speak
in the language of bears, which only you can

2241
02:38:37,869 --> 02:38:46,557
understand at this moment, says, "You walk with
this one. Is she your charge?" And Trinket voices

2242
02:38:46,557 --> 02:38:54,589
back, you hear the (bear noises) up to the bear,
as you hear coming out, "She is everything. Her

2243
02:38:54,589 --> 02:39:04,426
"life is mine. You take her, you take me, or we
walk on and remember you as a kind soul."

2244
02:39:04,426 --> 02:39:18,551
The giant bear looks down, "Very well. If you are
at her side, I take your charge, as well." And the

2245
02:39:18,551 --> 02:39:25,326
spirit bear steps forward, passing through you,
and passing through Trinket's form, and what feels

2246
02:39:25,326 --> 02:39:32,412
like this rush of warm air. And then disperses
into a series of sparkles. You watch the energy

2247
02:39:32,412 --> 02:39:38,418
slowly drift down and fade into the ground around
you, and everything gets quiet. The trees slowly

2248
02:39:38,418 --> 02:39:45,974
creak back and open the perimeter of this forest
around you, leaving you alone. And Trinket comes

2249
02:39:45,974 --> 02:39:48,847
up and licks your face.

2250
02:39:48,847 --> 02:39:50,230
LAURA: Oh!

2251
02:39:50,230 --> 02:39:58,954

2252
02:39:58,954 --> 02:40:02,639
MATT: As he's looking at you, you look down and
you can see the necklace that you hold is actually

2253
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:10,345
shimmering with a blue light that passed through
you, and it slowly fades to its dark normal form.

2254
02:40:10,345 --> 02:40:17,253
SAM: You're part bear now!

2255
02:40:17,253 --> 02:40:20,047
MATT: So. That's your new item card for Raven's
Slumber.

2256
02:40:20,081 --> 02:40:23,744
(cheering)

2257
02:40:23,793 --> 02:40:26,015
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's it do?

2258
02:40:26,015 --> 02:40:28,017
LAURA: I don't know.

2259
02:40:28,017 --> 02:40:34,485
MATT: So. I've got to finish this quickly because
we've got to get to the Q and A, but as of this

2260
02:40:34,485 --> 02:40:39,117
point in time, and I'll give you an ability card,
but Trinket now benefits from your Hunter's Mark.

2261
02:40:39,117 --> 02:40:42,637
(cheering)

2262
02:40:42,637 --> 02:40:46,904
MATT: And has an ability called Primal Fury you
can use once per short rest that I'll get to next

2263
02:40:46,904 --> 02:40:58,941
episode. As you all gather around this moment of
silence, this quiet tension that has now

2264
02:40:58,985 --> 02:41:04,739
dispersed, you see Trinket lift up Vex from the
base of her cloak and put her back on her feet,

2265
02:41:04,739 --> 02:41:10,452
nuzzles the side of her, and you can see the trees
overhead open up a little wider than they were

2266
02:41:10,452 --> 02:41:14,705
before, leaving some moonlight to hit the two of
them. And that's where we'll go ahead and leave

2267
02:41:14,705 --> 02:41:16,158
this session this week.

2268
02:41:16,158 --> 02:41:23,052
(cheering)

2269
02:41:23,052 --> 02:41:26,701
MATT: Thank you, guys!

2270
02:41:26,822 --> 02:41:45,302
(cheering)

2271
02:41:45,302 --> 02:41:47,224
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is it Thursday yet?

2272
02:41:47,224 --> 02:41:53,622
(cheering)

2273
02:41:53,622 --> 02:42:01,931
MATT: Thank you. (laughs) Thank you guys so much
for joining us here live, this has been an awesome

2274
02:42:01,931 --> 02:42:06,919
and incredible first experience for all of us.
Thank you so much for tuning in and watching with

2275
02:42:06,919 --> 02:42:10,921
us this week. We're looking forward to the GenCon
show in a few weeks, so some of you guys over on

2276
02:42:10,921 --> 02:42:15,039
that side of the US can hopefully come and see us
here as well, and join in this fantastic energy

2277
02:42:15,094 --> 02:42:19,627
that tonight was just filled with. So hopefully
we'll do more of these as time progresses.

2278
02:42:19,627 --> 02:42:20,735
TRAVIS: Thank you, Loot Crate!

2279
02:42:20,735 --> 02:42:22,531
LAURA: Thank you, Loot Crate!

2280
02:42:22,531 --> 02:42:27,867
MATT: Thank you Loot Crate for supporting us and
being so awesome, being a fantastic sponsor, and

2281
02:42:27,867 --> 02:42:35,254
yeah, I guess, is it Thursday yet? We'll see you
guys in a couple weeks.
