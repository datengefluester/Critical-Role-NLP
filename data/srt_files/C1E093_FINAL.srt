00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,293
[no audio]

2
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:06,207
MATT: Where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,233
(laughter)

4
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:13,361
MATT: Why's everyone laughing? So yes! We're going
to hop in here, but before we do, we have some

5
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:18,763
quick announcements to get through. First and
foremost, we have a survey that we put up a couple

6
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:24,568
of weeks ago. It ends April 18th. If you happen to
have an opportunity, please go ahead and put in

7
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:27,969
your information, let us know where you're from,
how much of the show you've watched, what kind of

8
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,606
future things from Critical Role you'd like to
see. It's us getting a feel for the size and

9
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:36,683
spread of the community and it's very helpful and
awesome. So you can check that out at

10
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:42,843
geekandsundry.com/crsurvey. You'll probably see
the link in chat as well, please do that if you

11
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:48,438
haven't yet, that'd be awesome! You have until
April 18th. As far as merch goes, we're still

12
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,028
out of stock on dice, I believe?

13
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:50,890
LAURA: No!

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,751
MATT: No?

15
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,957
LAURA: There's officially 30 sets left, according
to--

16
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,237
SAM: 30 sets?

17
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:56,242
LAURA: 30 sets.

18
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:57,390
LIAM: Sorry, they're gone.

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,630
(laughter)

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,958
LAURA: There are 30 sets left in the store, we
will be ordering more. So there will be more, but

21
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,768
I don't know when that's, you know, going to come
in. So 30 sets for the time being.

22
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:14,699
MATT: Fantastic. Thank you Laura. Yes. Taliesin!
Wednesday Club coming up, right?

23
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:19,032
TALIESIN: There is a Wednesday Club. We're doing
Comics 101, it's going to be our intro to how to

24
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:25,416
read comics! The notion is like the show that you
would show your grandmother, or your friend who's

25
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:30,396
never apparently seen a written word next to a
picture before. They do exist! I'm sadly not going

26
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:34,611
to be there, but Amy and Matt are going to throw
together something really, really awesome, and I'm

27
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,781
going to be helping out from the sidelines,
throwing them stuff, because I'm going to be out

28
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:39,144
of town. But yay.

29
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:44,224
MATT: Awesome. Speaking of Taliesin and a
different Matt, we're both going to be on Eric's

30
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:47,750
TBD RPG tomorrow at noon Pacific time.

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,633
SAM: Oh. The dice are gone.

32
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:50,812
MATT: The dice are gone.

33
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:51,950
NOELLE: Just now.

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,030
MATT: Well done. Jesus.

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,164
LAURA: Good job, guys that got them!

36
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:02,643
MATT: Yay! We'll have more soon! But we'll both be
on Eric's TBD RPG tomorrow at noon, here at Geek

37
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:07,581
and Sundry, Pacific time for the Doctor Who RPG.
I'll be returning as my

38
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:10,178
character Meatstick, the--

39
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:11,203
TRAVIS: Meatstick?

40
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:13,954
MATT: Meatstick, yeah. He's a heavily
experimented-on Ood who is massively buff and

41
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:19,797
looks kind of like Nemesis from Resident Evil 3.
But with more of a tentacle mouth.

42
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,220
So that'll be fun!

43
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,664
TALIESIN: Yes! I'll be doing my old man voice.
It's very fun, yes.

44
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:27,406
MATT: I know it is, and I believe Darin De Paul
will be joining us as well.

45
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:28,979
TALIESIN: I think he's a maybe.

46
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,299
MATT: Maybe? He's supposed to be. I think he might
be a little late. I'll check in.

47
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,935
MARISHA: I think he's going to be on. I think.
Pretty sure.

48
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:39,892
MATT: Mystery! Abound! Marisha! New Signal Boost,
went up this week?

49
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,708
MARISHA: Yes! It's... me!

50
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,660
(laughter)

51
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,705
MATT: Full circle!

52
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:50,687
MARISHA: Again! I'm back! Go watch-- actually,
we're going to be playing it over the course of the

53
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:53,149
break. So that we have a break.

54
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,274
MATT: You should watch it.

55
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,451
MARISHA: So you'll watch it over the course of the
break.

56
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:57,338
MATT: It's only getting weirder, folks.

57
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:00,909
MARISHA: It's getting really weird. You can tell
it's such an outlet for us of the creative team.

58
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:09,343
It's got a lot of meta things going on,
reflecting our day-to-day lives. It always has

59
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,730
been. It's great.

60
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,675
MATT: I will be at Sakura-Con by the way, next
weekend. April 14th through the 16th up in

61
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:20,512
Seattle. Be doing some panels, signings, and fun
stuff, so if you guys are up in the Seattle area

62
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:27,369
next weekend, come say hi! It'll be fun. Sorry,
pardon my belch. Snuck up on me. And once again,

63
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:33,586
Will Friedle is going to be at the Wales Comic
Con, April 8th and 9th. Real soon. So if you're

64
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:39,196
near Wales, go say hi to Will, give him a bunch of
really large presents that he can't bring back on

65
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:44,249
the plane, they will become his problem. So,
that's my recommendation. Fuck that guy, exactly.

66
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:50,234
And a reminder: me, Taliesin, and Marisha will be
guests at Momocon, May 25th to the 28th in

67
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:55,100
Atlanta, Georgia! So if you're in that area, other
side of the country, come say hi then! Because

68
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,468
that'd be fun.

69
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:57,743
TALIESIN: Yeah.

70
00:03:57,743 --> 00:04:03,760
MATT: And Talks Machina, of course, every Tuesday,
at 7PM Pacific here on Twitch and Alpha, where we

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,623
talk about-- next week, we'll be talking about this
episode! And the episode before that a little bit,

72
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,695
probably, too.

73
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:10,455
MARISHA: Yeah. I hope everyone liked the panel, by
the way.

74
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,354
MATT: The panel went great! We had a great turnout
at WonderCon!

75
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:14,047
MARISHA: Yeah, thanks everybody who came!

76
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,169
TALIESIN: It was super cool.

77
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,443
MATT: Like we kind of filled the arena. I had this
big fear we were going to get up on stage and it

78
00:04:18,443 --> 00:04:20,543
was going to be, like, seven people in the front
row and just empty space.

79
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,146
MARISHA: Apparently 2,800.

80
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:23,192
SAM: Oh wow!

81
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:24,489
MARISHA: 2,800 strong.

82
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,491
MATT: Jesus.

83
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:26,961
LAURA: You Critters!

84
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:28,401
MARISHA: Yeah, so many Critters.

85
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,805
MATT: So thanks for coming, guys!

86
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:31,532
LIAM: Great costumes, lots of cosplay.

87
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:34,479
TRAVIS: Oh, Brian Wayne Foster also said the
Wondercon panel will be on G&S's

88
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,894
YouTube Friday at 8PM, in case you missed it on
Talks Machina.

89
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:43,227
MATT: Great, so you can check it out then. And I
believe, unless I'm mistaken, that's it. Anything

90
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:45,880
else anyone wants to talk about? Noelle, anything
you want to talk about?

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,692
NOELLE: I had a great day today--

92
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:48,670
MATT: Awesome!

93
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,070
NOELLE: -- and it was really fun. I had a good
lunch.

94
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,175
MATT: I'm so glad. What'd you have?

95
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,204
NOELLE: Falafel.

96
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:53,826
MATT: Nice, good choice.

97
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,886
LIAM: Hey look, this is a book that she made, and
it's so good! And she signed it for me and I'm

98
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,598
reading it to my kids and they love it!

99
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:00,608
NOELLE: There's a bear in it.

100
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,017
LAURA: There is a bear in it!

101
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:06,295
NOELLE: More than that in it, too, let me tell
you. Just getting started.

102
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:09,710
Lots of different animals.

103
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,994
(laughter)

104
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:17,213
MATT: Which, by the way, thank you again, Noelle,
for coming and playing this again this week.

105
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:21,700
NOELLE: Yeah, hey, is anyone tied to a table and
needs help right now? Because apparently I'm

106
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,823
available now. I'm here to help.

107
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:27,351
(laughter)

108
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:35,474
MATT: And, on that note, let's go ahead and dive
in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

109
00:05:35,474 --> 00:07:05,697
[dramatic music]

110
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:11,403
MATT: And welcome back. Just so you guys know, we
know there is a bit of an audio-sync issue that's

111
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:15,526
happening right now. It's apparently not on our
end; our systems are syncing just fine. It might

112
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:19,538
be a Twitch-side thing. Hopefully they're working
on it right now and seeing if we can figure out

113
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:25,386
how to get that fixed. In the meantime, my
apologies. We will continue playing, and at the

114
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:32,201
very least the upload will be synced. So keep an
ear out. Thank you for your patience. Technical!

115
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:42,051
All righty, so. Catching us up from last week. Vox
Machina goes to hell. In tying up loose ends and

116
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:49,859
dealing with lingering business, you've decided to
travel to the Nine Hells of Baator, specifically

117
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:57,185
the second layer of Dis, to where the iron city of
Dis, under the rule of Dispater, to seek out the

118
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:04,050
place where Hotis, the rakshasa, which is now in a
chain of perpetually hunting members of your team.

119
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,569
You decided it was best to end it there, as the
only way to kill the entity is to destroy it on

120
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,352
its own home plane.

121
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:16,518
So you gathered yourselves, you transported via
Keyleth onto the second layer of hell, you

122
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:26,129
wandered incognito as various demonic-adjacent
entities. You've avoided a modicum of interest or

123
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:38,069
other issues, you've made friends and signed a
contract for aid with a cambion owner of some sort

124
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:45,279
of tavern in the vicinity, you met with a silly
shop owner, you ate soul crystals, little soul

125
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:54,403
stones, and you've agreed to, for safe passage
into the subterranean prison of Mentiri, which

126
00:08:54,403 --> 00:09:01,722
apparently houses Hotis as he's reforming, you've
come to discover, you will go and assassinate a

127
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:08,232
pit fiend named Utugash, who is the superior of
the individual you signed the contract with. And

128
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:14,595
upon his destruction, and without leaking any
information that could tie this individual to the

129
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:20,648
assassination, be granted passage safely and
unspoiled into the prison to seek out your quarry,

130
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,643
slay it, and return home safely.

131
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:30,832
As you snuck into the home of this pit fiend, you
quickly discovered a dwarvish female had endured

132
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:35,045
quite some torture and was found chained to a
table. You released her, and she introduced

133
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:39,116
herself as Tova. Actually, I don't believe you
ever introduced yourself. You didn't give a name?

134
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:39,898
Did you?

135
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:40,950
NOELLE: It's in there somewhere.

136
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,894
MATT: I'm sure it was somewhere in there.

137
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:42,846
LAURA: Yeah, she said her name!

138
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,477
MATT: I think you did. Okay, good. Little else,
though.

139
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,211
LAURA: I wrote it down.

140
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,681
MARISHA: I know. That means it happened!

141
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:51,149
MATT: There you go. That was awesome.

142
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:56,481
LAURA: I also wrote down "chain devils know." I
don't know what that note meant.

143
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:58,329
NOELLE: Oh my god, what do they know?

144
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,300
TRAVIS: You were tripping last session.

145
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,455
MARISHA: Because the chain devil potentially
knew--

146
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,198
LAURA: About the Bastion of Flesh, is that what it
was?

147
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:05,061
MARISHA: Yeah.

148
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,404
MATT: Well, there you go.

149
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,716
LAURA: It was just, chain devils know, period.

150
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:09,988
NOELLE: Very broody.

151
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:14,638
MATT: Chain devils, period: no. N-O. Period.
Just don't.

152
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,022
LAURA: That, too.

153
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:22,473
MATT: However, your new dwarven friend transformed
into some sort of a lycanthrope werebear, taking a

154
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:28,918
greatsword from Grog's stash in the bag of
holding. You gave chase over one of the guardians

155
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:35,588
and keepers of the stronghold, killed it, and in
doing so alerted other members of the stronghold,

156
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:40,114
killed them, and in doing so alerted other members
of the stronghold, and Grog, creeping forward down

157
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:46,765
this hallway, revealed a central chamber where
betwixt two pools of what appear to be molten,

158
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:55,123
glowing blood, and sitting upon a throne, the
corpulent, grotesque, sweaty, slick pit fiend

159
00:10:55,123 --> 00:11:02,229
named Utugash sits there. The terrible toothy
grin, who speaks telepathically into your mind.

160
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:11,442
"So. What do you bring to me to pleasure?" And I
need you all to roll initiative.

161
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:14,893
LAURA: Oh god! That quickly, huh?

162
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:17,189
TRAVIS: Telepathically?

163
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:19,180
MATT: Yeah, just like the last one spoke to you.

164
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,879
TRAVIS: Are people just too lazy to use their
mouths?

165
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,174
TALIESIN: Mouths are for eating, not for talking.

166
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,755
MARISHA: It's like texting in hell.

167
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:41,437
MATT: Kind of, yeah. All righty, folks. So, given
that point. 25 to 20?

168
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:42,810
LIAM: 24.

169
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,331
LAURA: 24.

170
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,803
TRAVIS: Whatever.

171
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:52,468
MATT: 20 to 15. Who has what?

172
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:53,400
SAM: 19.

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,125
TALIESIN: 15.

174
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:01,356
NOELLE: 16.

175
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:02,864
TRAVIS: Samesies.

176
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:06,031
NOELLE: Oh, we're going together. Yeah!

177
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:12,190
MARISHA: 17.

178
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,683
SAM: Wow, we all did pretty well.

179
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:19,093
MARISHA: Yeah we did, for us.

180
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,849
LAURA: What'd you roll?

181
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,757
SAM: We're all between 15 and 24.

182
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:32,614
MATT: All right, so, as the pit fiend's still just
standing there, its arm hanging over the edge of

183
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:39,954
this giant axe it's using, propping it, it stares
at Grog. It seems to be completely lazy,

184
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:44,278
confident, and doesn't feel threatened whatsoever
by the presence of this goliath that has stepped

185
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:50,983
into its visual range. However, top of the round,
Vax and Vex. What do you guys want to do?

186
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:51,830
LIAM: Take it.

187
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,968
LAURA: No, you go.

188
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,205
LIAM: Okay.

189
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:55,682
MATT: So you guys are right there.

190
00:12:55,682 --> 00:13:01,365
LIAM: Clicking the Boots of Haste. I'm going to
now-- I know that there's a clot of people, but I

191
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:06,771
have a lot of movement now, so I'm going to slide
back towards Grog? No, towards Tova. That's a big

192
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:12,622
bear at the other entrance. Towards the other
entrance. Oh, that's a wall.

193
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,349
LAURA: There's no other entrance.

194
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:16,800
MATT: The only entrance you know of is this one
right there.

195
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,575
LAURA: We really should have gone up and looked at
it up close before.

196
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,702
MATT: That's okay. Now you know.

197
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:25,252
LIAM: Then I'm going to slide along the wall up to
where Grog is.

198
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:29,113
MATT: Okay. You move along on this side?

199
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:36,051
LIAM: Yeah. Am I within range of oily guy? What's
the distance, though, ten feet?

200
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:39,831
MATT: The distance between you and Utugash would
be 25 feet.

201
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,459
LIAM: 25 feet. All right.

202
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,989
LAURA: Kill him!

203
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:49,106
LIAM: Little test run. Let's dagger, dagger,
dagger.

204
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,488
MATT: Okay.

205
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:58,426
LIAM: Okay. Because I don't know if he's really
there or not. First one is 33.

206
00:13:58,661 --> 00:13:59,899
MATT: That hits.

207
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:10,604
LIAM: Yeah, good. That's 12, plus eight, nine--

208
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:18,998
LAURA: I was just thinking because it's at the
same time, technically our moves. Could I send

209
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,798
Trinket in?

210
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:24,558
MATT: Trinket into the room? Or just into the
hallway?

211
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:28,860
LAURA: Well, that way Trinket's next to him so
that my brother gets better--

212
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,536
doesn't he get better--

213
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:37,303
MATT: Trinket, from here, would be five, ten, 15,
20, 25, 30, 35, 40.

214
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,619
Trinket has a speed of 40, right?

215
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,536
TRAVIS: I think that's right.

216
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:45,368
LAURA: I think so, yeah. Could he get there?

217
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,281
MATT: Trinket can get there.

218
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:53,890
LAURA: Oh god, that is so scary! I don't know, now
that I'm saying it, if that's the way to go.

219
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,444
TRAVIS: Go with your instincts.

220
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:58,711
LAURA: Here's my question.

221
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,324
SAM: We have a backup bear.

222
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,979
(laughter)

223
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:10,483
LAURA: While he's figuring out his shit, if
Trinket falls and I don't see him, does he still

224
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:14,780
come into Raven's Slumber if it's within 100 feet?
Or do I have to have visual?

225
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,261
MATT: You don't know.

226
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:18,651
LAURA: (gasps) Matthew Mercer!

227
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,879
TRAVIS: You know, there is really one way to find
out.

228
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,469
MATT: No, as long as the enchantment's in the
radius, it's fine.

229
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:33,792
(laughter)

230
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:37,708
LAURA: Then he's going to do that so that you have
a better attack on him.

231
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,421
LIAM: Well, I'm going first, so I've got the goods
already.

232
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:41,727
LAURA: Motherfuck. Whatever.

233
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,508
MATT: You rush in, you get there.

234
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:47,551
LIAM: First blade goes, and I'm going to Smite
him.

235
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:49,565
MATT: Are you waiting for Trinket to get there
before you throw?

236
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:52,017
LIAM: No, I'm not. I went already.

237
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,694
MATT: All right. Go for your attacks.

238
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:57,198
TRAVIS: But you could, he's saying you could have
your advantage on that.

239
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:04,862
LIAM: I have it because I'm going before. Because
I'm smiting him, first hit's for 55 total.

240
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:07,394
MATT: 55 points of damage. Slick.

241
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:14,074
LIAM: That's the first. The second is a 20 to hit.
And the third is a 27 to hit.

242
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,925
MATT: All three hit.

243
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:18,730
LIAM: The next one, I will try--

244
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,842
NOELLE: What could possibly go wrong?

245
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:24,513
LAURA: Just keep saying that!

246
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:28,257
LIAM: So he has to save against a DC 15 for poison
on the second attack.

247
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:32,221
MATT: No, it doesn't. He's immune.

248
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:42,446
LIAM: Yeah, I figured I'd try. The next is nine,
plus psychic damage, damn it, 12. So a total of

249
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:51,892
14, just for those two attacks. And then I will
use some more movement to move past Grog, still in

250
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:55,740
the hole, pressed against the outside of the door,
out of his sight.

251
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,732
MATT: Okay. So you're now hiding against this side
of the wall there. As Trinket runs in into the

252
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:08,473
center of the area, as Trinket rushes in and
rushes up to the side of the pit fiend,

253
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,523
what are you doing?

254
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:20,472
LAURA: I'm going to back up next to Tova. Wait,
who's the big guy? What's that big thing?

255
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,658
Is that Doty?

256
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:22,884
MATT: That's Doty.

257
00:17:22,884 --> 00:17:30,985
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to get closer to Doty, and
I'm going to hold my attack until I have visual.

258
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:43,347
And then I'm going to have Trinket attack him,
since I don't have visual on him right now, as my

259
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:47,819
bonus move. So he's just going to get one attack.

260
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:57,924
MATT: All right, let me check one thing real fast
on beastmaster. You are technically taking the

261
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:00,325
attack action yourself. I'll allow it.

262
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:08,982
LAURA: You said I can get my attacks and then have
Trinket be my bonus action, because he can do one

263
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:15,982
attack as my bonus action. Single attack on bonus
for bestial fury.

264
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:19,395
MATT: That's true. Yeah. I'll allow it. How it
usually works is your action is the attack, and

265
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:23,283
then as a bonus action you can give it, it's like
you're both attacking at the same time. You're

266
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:26,257
holding your action, but it is still an attack
action, so I'll allow it. Go ahead and use it.

267
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:27,357
It's fine.

268
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:31,964
LAURA: All right. He's going to just be in there,
roaring. Get them, Trink!

269
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:39,489
He's going to roll a 21.

270
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:41,668
MATT: 21 hits.

271
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:49,620
LAURA: Yay! Whoa! That's a 15!

272
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:52,600
MATT: Awesome. Are Trinket's attacks magical?

273
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,293
LAURA: Well, he's a really magically charismatic
masseuse--

274
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:05,953
MATT: So Trinket gets an attack, scrapes the claw,
gets up there as it runs into the room, the claw

275
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:10,992
strikes, slashes across the front of the belly of
the giant red pit fiend. It doesn't do as much

276
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:12,466
damage as you hoped it would.

277
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:13,533
LAURA: Does it do any damage?

278
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:19,447
MATT: It does some damage, but not as much as
you'd hoped. All righty. That ends your turn.

279
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:22,388
You're holding your action until you have visual
on the pit fiend. Taryon, what are you doing?

280
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:32,871
SAM: It's rather stuffy in here, so we should open
a window. I'll run up to right in front of Vex and

281
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,534
slap a window on the wall.

282
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,663
MATT: Okay!

283
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:39,772
NOELLE: Did you run out of doors?

284
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,560
SAM: I've run out of doors.

285
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,671
(laughter)

286
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:47,923
SAM: I came with one. But I have two windows!

287
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:53,394
MATT: So for the purposes of this, this is now a
window here.

288
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:59,792
MARISHA: Does it have nice Roman-style shade and
then little baskets?

289
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:04,916
MATT: Yeah, no. It's beautifully carved. Yeah, it
was like some Italian architects

290
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,533
designed this beautiful--

291
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:09,322
SAM: It's a casement window, so I have to go--
(squeaking)

292
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:12,000
(laughter)

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,322
MATT: Perfect. So, to Taryon. Use your action to
rush forward, you rip off the patch, slam the

294
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:24,135
patch on the side, and you watch as the stone
suddenly crumbles to dust in that space. Window is

295
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,528
now open in the side of that wall. As soon as that
happens--

296
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:27,401
LAURA: I attack.

297
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:28,569
MATT: Vex, go make your attack.

298
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:29,387
LAURA: Okay.

299
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:30,723
MATT: Two against the pit fiend.

300
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,480
LAURA: Two against-- I want to do Bramble Shot as my
first attack.

301
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:33,506
MATT: Go for it.

302
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:38,681
LAURA: Okay. Oh! 30.

303
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:40,888
MATT: 30 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

304
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:44,163
LAURA: Okay. So I get Sneak Attack because
Trinket's next to him!

305
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,304
MATT: Yep.

306
00:20:45,304 --> 00:21:00,265
LAURA: Okay. 4d8. Seven plus ten is 17. 17 just
for that brambleness. And then he has to roll a

307
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:04,398
strength saving throw of DC 17.

308
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:08,069
MATT: That's cocked. Yeah, rolled a 20.

309
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:20,300
LAURA: Okay. 15. 17 plus three is 20. Three
lightning damage of that and then Sneak Attack is

310
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,354
another six.

311
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:23,849
MATT: Nice. All righty.

312
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,380
LAURA: So that's the first attack.

313
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,636
MATT: Go for it. Second attack?

314
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:31,115
LAURA: Second attack! What was that? 21.

315
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:32,700
MATT: 21 hits.

316
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,564
LAURA: All right! What's five plus eight? Is that
13?

317
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,581
NOELLE: Yes.

318
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:40,826
LAURA: 13.

319
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:44,308
NOELLE: Why are you asking me? I'm a bear.
Notoriously bad at math.

320
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:45,829
LIAM: Moneybags, what the hell?

321
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:48,440
LAURA: 15 with two lightning damage. 16, 17.

322
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,261
MATT: All righty. So both arrows fire off. You
watch as the one slams into the side of Utugash

323
00:21:55,261 --> 00:22:00,945
and the vines wrap around. Utugash brings one arm
up, tears them off of his body, picks up the axe

324
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,888
and hefts it over the shoulder looking back
at where the window now exists where once there

325
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:09,181
was none. Looks over and sees you and Taryon
through the window.

326
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:13,744
LAURA: Am I allowed to move back at all, or duck
under the window?

327
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:17,711
MATT: You could attempt to make a hide, but he
was looking directly at you.

328
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,907
You can move on inside.

329
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:20,238
LAURA: Well, I probably can't hide; isn't that a
bonus action?

330
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,205
MATT: Yeah, you already used bonus action.

331
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:22,231
LAURA: So if I just move out of the way.

332
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:23,236
MATT: So yeah, you can move out of the way if you
want.

333
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:23,821
LAURA: Okay.

334
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:24,867
MATT: This way or this way?

335
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:25,803
LAURA: Towards Doty.

336
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,486
MATT: Towards Doty? Okay, so you're going to move
on the other side of Doty. That's going to be your

337
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,749
movement, there.

338
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,604
LAURA: Okay.

339
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:38,132
MATT: Okay. Cool. That is going to bring us to
Taryon. Did you want to do anything with Doty?

340
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:41,871
SAM: Well, he can't fit through a window.
(laughs)

341
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:43,930
MATT: How big's the window in size?

342
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,165
SAM: It's two feet by four feet, I believe?

343
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:50,929
MATT: He could pull through, but it's going to
take half his movement to do so.

344
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:56,265
SAM: I'll just say, Doty! Go back up Grog!

345
00:22:56,265 --> 00:23:07,291
MATT: And Doty runs this way. Five, ten, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35. Doty gets right there, just crammed

346
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:16,337
through the hallway and squeezed through. And
that's going to be where Doty stays. All right,

347
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:25,562
that ends your turn. All right, at this point now,
Utugash puts one hand up and gives some sort of a

348
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:30,856
marker in the air. You're not quite sure what the
meaning is or what it's doing. You're the only one

349
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,623
who really sees it, Taryon.

350
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:33,924
TRAVIS: I can't see it?

351
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:35,680
MATT: Well, you see it too, Grog, actually.

352
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,525
TRAVIS: I totally know he was (sings) dancing,
dancing, dancing!

353
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,384
SAM: I don't have any idea?

354
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:44,243
MATT: You don't, actually. He just goes like--

355
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:46,380
SAM: Oh. Semaphore.

356
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:54,062
MATT: That's it. All right, Keyleth. Then Tova and
Grog, you're on deck, so--

357
00:23:54,253 --> 00:24:00,525
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to scooch Vex over, be
like, sorry, excuse me! I just want to-- And into

358
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:02,434
the window? And I want to do--

359
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:03,858
LAURA: I'm not next to the window anymore.

360
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:05,533
MATT: Taryon is. You moosh past Taryon.

361
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,582
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. Excuse me, Tary. Blight!

362
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:09,147
MATT: Blight? Okay.

363
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:14,376
ALL: Blight.

364
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,368
MARISHA: Bees?

365
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:18,282
MATT: Range on Blight is 60 feet, right?

366
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,585
MARISHA: 30.

367
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,327
MATT: 30 feet?

368
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,537
MARISHA: Am I within 30 feet?

369
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:24,460
MATT: You're going to have to get closer.

370
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,889
SAM: Each one of those squares in the room with
him are ten feet squares, right?

371
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:31,800
MATT: Each square is five feet. It's five, ten,
15--

372
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,510
SAM: The big squares are ten, yeah.

373
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,555
MATT: Yeah, the big squares are ten.

374
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,187
LIAM: It's hard to see the smaller ones.

375
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:37,445
MARISHA: All right.

376
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:41,342
MATT: So you'd have go through the window to do
it.

377
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:45,150
SAM: (sings) Come to my window!

378
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,801
MATT and LAURA: (sing) Come inside.

379
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:53,875
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, I'll go through the window.

380
00:24:53,875 --> 00:25:00,210
MATT: Okay, so you step through, you get about
there. You have ten feet more movement. So that'll

381
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,453
do it. All right, so.

382
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:04,140
MARISHA: Can I Blight and then back out? Back
through the window?

383
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,633
MATT: You're not going to have enough movement.
You'll get up into the window. You won't get all

384
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:07,791
the way through.

385
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,800
MARISHA: (grunts) Shit!

386
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,421
MATT: That is a 21. What's your DC?

387
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:18,616
MARISHA: Fuck! Are you serious? 20.

388
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:20,821
MATT: Yeah, so takes half damage. Go ahead and
roll damage.

389
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,412
SAM: Wait, he took damage, though!

390
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:24,044
MARISHA: Only half damage.

391
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,299
SAM: Because he's immune to magic or something? Is
that what's going on?

392
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:33,213
MATT: No, you learned as the last battle, that pit
fiends, as do most devils, have magic resistance.

393
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:36,920
They have advantage on saving throws against
spells. You figured this information

394
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,698
when you researched.

395
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:46,665
LAURA: And only magical weapons can damage them,
or they have resist on non-magical weapons?

396
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:49,260
MATT: They seem to have resistance from
non-magical weapons, from the research you've

397
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,218
done, yeah.

398
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:51,934
LAURA: Based on my lack of Trinket attack fullness.

399
00:25:51,934 --> 00:26:01,005
MARISHA: 32 total? And yeah, am I able to like
barrel roll, like through the window?

400
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:04,800
MATT: You get up partway through the window, and
that's the extent of where you go.

401
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,944
MARISHA: Hang on! Wait!

402
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:13,489
(laughter)

403
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,932
LAURA: I'd like to think one of your antlers
caught, and you're like, (yelps).

404
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:18,517
MARISHA: Not like this!

405
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:20,933
(laughter)

406
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:23,452
MATT: All righty. Tova. Grog.

407
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:24,673
NOELLE: Oh boy!

408
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:27,778
TRAVIS: Bears first.

409
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:32,147
NOELLE: Okay, so how far would I have to run to
get into the front door?

410
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:33,695
MATT: To get over here?

411
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:34,698
NOELLE: Yeah.

412
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:40,418
MATT: That would be 30. 35 feet would get you
right at the front door, there.

413
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:45,917
NOELLE: So if I drag Keyleth out of the window,
could I go through the window? Am I too big?

414
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:50,617
MATT: You could go through the window. You'd lose
about ten feet of your movement, but you'd be able

415
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:53,138
to get through it. You'd probably push her out of
it.

416
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:58,930
NOELLE: I push her. Can I pull her? (laughs) I
have to push her back in and then go through?

417
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,181
MARISHA: I'm like the golden retriever with the
stick.

418
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:04,558
MATT: If you carry her through, that's going to
use part of your actions this turn. Or you could

419
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:06,976
just barrel through and push her out. What're you
going to do?

420
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:10,050
NOELLE: All right, so, I can go 45 feet.

421
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,194
MATT: Yeah.

422
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:18,555
NOELLE: So if I just bear-barrel through, how
close could I get to this guy?

423
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:24,231
MATT: You can get right up next to him.

424
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:28,463
NOELLE: All right, I'm going to do that. I'm going
to go for it.

425
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:38,423
MATT: You rush over and go right past, now bear
and bear, side by side. Keyleth, you get knocked

426
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:44,488
out of the window, prone. All of a sudden this
giant werebear (impact noise) just shoulder checks

427
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:49,417
you and you go flying out, landing on your face,
on the heated stone. (sizzling noise) Ah!

428
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,581
SAM: Oh! It's okay.

429
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:52,634
NOELLE: Sorry!

430
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:55,056
MARISHA: It's fine, I needed a tan! I was getting
a little pasty.

431
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:56,717
MATT: Take three points of fire damage.

432
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:57,712
(groaning)

433
00:27:57,712 --> 00:28:02,432
NOELLE: God! I would feel worse if your shopping
trip hadn't gotten me so much more tortured

434
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:09,014
yesterday than it should have. I don't feel that
bad. I'm going to be honest.

435
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:11,061
MARISHA: You legit shouldn't.

436
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:14,489
NOELLE: So now I'm in, is there any way I could
get on the other side of him from Trinket?

437
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:19,910
MATT: Currently, no. Your full movement gets you
right up next to the pit fiend.

438
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:27,572
NOELLE: Damn. This is a bad plan. All right. Well,
I'm just going to hit him with my--

439
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,694
MATT: You have a bonus action, too.

440
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:33,138
NOELLE: Are my claws only magical when I'm doing
the thing?

441
00:28:33,138 --> 00:28:34,281
MATT: Your claws are magical in general.

442
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,842
NOELLE: I'm just going to hit him with my claws,
then.

443
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:36,736
MATT: Okay.

444
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,779
NOELLE: All right.

445
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,625
MATT: So you take the sword and chuck it aside
for a second, and bring out your bear claws and

446
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,931
you're going to go for a double strike?

447
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:43,950
NOELLE: 19?

448
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,239
MATT: A 19 to hit?

449
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,093
NOELLE: Yep.

450
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:47,757
MATT: 19 misses, unfortunately.

451
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:50,058
NOELLE: Goddamn it. And 25.

452
00:28:50,058 --> 00:28:54,210
MATT: 25 does. The first strike goes (scraping
sound), scrapes across the front of the belly of

453
00:28:54,210 --> 00:29:00,993
the pit fiend. No damage sustained, chuckles
deeply. You back up with another strike.

454
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:04,171
NOELLE: All right. So that's a 14.

455
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:05,772
MATT: 14 damage?

456
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:07,002
NOELLE: Yeah, I guess so.

457
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:09,709
MATT: All righty. And you can use your bonus
action to attack a third time if you want to.

458
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:16,171
NOELLE: Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to
cast Curse of Mutual Suffering. And I'm going to

459
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,849
amplify that. So I'm going to-- wait.

460
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:21,070
SAM: What're these words?

461
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:30,867
NOELLE: I'm super special. It's about to get extra
in here. So if I do a blood curse and I take

462
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:39,489
damage, does that mean that my werewolf state gets
agitated? If it's self-inflicted?

463
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:40,854
MATT: If it's self-inflicted, no.

464
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:43,757
NOELLE: Okay, all right. I'm going to amplify it.
So that means I take 14.

465
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:53,722
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and roll your
Crimson Rite die, which I think is a d8. So you

466
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:55,479
just roll a d8 and you take that much damage.

467
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:59,117
NOELLE: Oh. Right. I thought that it was my other
one, so that's fine. That's great. I took one

468
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:00,473
point of damage.

469
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:03,973
MATT: There you go. So you take one point of
damage, and, as far as the Mutual Suffering-- All

470
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:10,772
right, there you go. So. You watch as you rush up
to it, you slash it twice with your claws, and as

471
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:16,463
you pick up your sword, you put one hand up, and
as you close your fist, you watch as blood pools

472
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:20,998
in the center of your palm and drips out the
corners of your fingers. As it does, you watch the

473
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:29,953
veins on the outside of Utugash's stomach pulse
for a second, and his chuckle goes (groans), like

474
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,792
he got a tummy ache. All right, that ends your
turn.

475
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,484
NOELLE: Told you I was going to going to be
extra.

476
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,427
LIAM: The bear musk over here is palpable.

477
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:39,374
(laughter)

478
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:42,280
MATT: So that finishes Tova turn. Grog.

479
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,975
TRAVIS: Ah! I want to get in on the melee party.
May I run up to his opposite side?

480
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:50,150
MATT: Certainly.

481
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:56,574
TRAVIS: Just where his right arm is. Just so he's
got escorts on each end. May I smash together my

482
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:57,989
Titanstone Knuckles?

483
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,369
MATT: You may.

484
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:01,877
TRAVIS: It's like the Autobots.

485
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:03,644
LAURA: Yeah, it was good!

486
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:06,176
LIAM: (sings) You got the touch--

487
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:09,359
MARISHA and LIAM: (sings) You got the power!

488
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,315
MATT: You transform into your larger self.

489
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:17,335
TRAVIS: What's up, bitch? May I make two reckless
attacks?

490
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,732
MATT: You may.

491
00:31:18,732 --> 00:31:25,759
TRAVIS: Thank you. That's a 30.

492
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,427
MATT: That hits.

493
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:37,150
TRAVIS: 19. Nice. That is 36.

494
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,927
MATT: 36?

495
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:41,110
TRAVIS: No, that can't be. 33.

496
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,497
MATT: 33. Damage?

497
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:43,808
TRAVIS: No, I did the second hit.

498
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:46,417
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage for
each.

499
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:54,205
TRAVIS: 18 for the first one. These are
two-handed, by the way. 22 for the second one.

500
00:31:54,205 --> 00:32:00,991
MATT: Nice! So 40 points of damage on the two
strikes. As you rush up, almost diving into the

501
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:06,312
pool, you skirt off to the side, slam the
Titanstone Gauntlets together and grow to your

502
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:10,893
larger size. Swirling the axe in the air, you go
(whoosh), and the second strike in a big X

503
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:14,964
formation across the side of it. You see it
gashing across the arm and the upper muscles of

504
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:20,922
the shoulder, and you see his fingers grip the axe
with more anger and frustration.

505
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:24,345
TRAVIS: Oh, and this is the Thrower. It's still
the Dwarven Thrower, though, the hammer.

506
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:25,689
MATT: Right, right, the hammer, okay.

507
00:32:25,689 --> 00:32:28,429
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to go into a
frenzied rage?

508
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,150
MATT: You may.

509
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,099
TRAVIS: Thanks. And I don't get to attack.

510
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:33,462
MATT: Yeah.

511
00:32:33,462 --> 00:32:35,169
LAURA: What color is pit fiend blood?

512
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:46,901
MATT: It's a dark, dark blackish-purple. All
righty, that ends Grog and Tova's turn. Percival.

513
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:52,638
TALIESIN: That's looking really crowded over
there. I'm going to wander over to that first

514
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,889
prison cell and take a look inside that door.

515
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,690
LAURA: (gasps) Percival!

516
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,997
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

517
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:00,981
MARISHA: Percival. (laughs)

518
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:04,728
LAURA: I'm standing in the corner looking at him
like, (whispers) what are you fucking doing?

519
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:09,841
TALIESIN: Yeah, a lot. 27.

520
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:16,046
MATT: You glance inside, and you can see what
appear to be piles of goods: small chests, boxes,

521
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:22,325
crates. It looks like various things that have
been collected and just shoved in this corner and

522
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:24,542
locked up. There is a lock on this door.

523
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:30,075
TALIESIN: Okay. How's my visual on that guy
through the window?

524
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,574
MATT: Through here?

525
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,303
TALIESIN: And I ignore anything other than full
cover. I ignore three-quarter cover.

526
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,056
MATT: Yeah, you have visual.

527
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,379
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to take my first
shot at that lock.

528
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:40,634
MATT: You don't have a bonus action, we'll say,
because you moved up and just glanced inside.

529
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:41,925
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fine.

530
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:43,051
MATT: Okay.

531
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:47,079
TALIESIN: I'll take my first shot with the
Pepperbox at that lock.

532
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,011
MATT: The lock? Okay, go for it.

533
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:53,784
TALIESIN: That's 27.

534
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:57,226
MATT: 27? Okay, go ahead and roll damage on the
lock.

535
00:33:57,226 --> 00:34:06,149
TALIESIN: Obviously it doesn't take psychic
damage. That's 16 points of damage.

536
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:13,067
MATT: 16 points of damage? The lock blasts off,
and leaves hanging a small piece of twisted,

537
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:18,410
turned metal that once was the top of it. The door
is now unlocked and open.

538
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:23,191
TALIESIN: Cool. I'm going to turn and take my last
two shots at Orthax. I've got a plan.

539
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,296
MATT: Utugash.

540
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,834
TALIESIN: I've got an Orthax plan, never mind.
I've just given the game away!

541
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,971
NOELLE: Yelling out the wrong name in bed, eh?

542
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,962
(laughter)

543
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:36,095
MARISHA: Are you having PTSD flashbacks, Percival?
Are you okay?

544
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:38,996
TALIESIN: Oh man! I'm too tired. I'm going to mess
up my plan! This is so bad.

545
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,993
LIAM: I'm totally into you, (stammering) Utugash.

546
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:48,862
TALIESIN: First shot, I'm going to take the
Animus, and I'm going to try for a trick shot, for

547
00:34:48,862 --> 00:35:02,164
an arm shot. One for Grit, and just for safety's
sake-- no, that's all. That's a 31 to hit.

548
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,055
MATT: 31 hits.

549
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:08,549
TALIESIN: And that's ten, plus eight, plus 1d6
psychic. Plus I'm going to burn eight points of

550
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:13,795
Cabal's Ruin, which empties Cabal's Ruin.

551
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:14,997
MATT: Okay.

552
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:27,537
TALIESIN: So that's going to be 14 points of
damage, plus one point of psychic damage, plus--

553
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:30,568
MATT: 8d6 lightning.

554
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:32,880
SAM: Oh, shnikes!

555
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,355
MATT: Cabal's Ruin, man. Vestiges (singsong) at
your disposal!

556
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:45,231
TALIESIN: Five, six. Yeah, I'll take a seven and an
eight, I'll give these back to you. (continues

557
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:56,752
counting) 23 points, does that seem right?

558
00:35:56,752 --> 00:36:01,022
MATT: 23 points, okay.

559
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:08,646
TALIESIN: 23 points of lightning damage. And also
he has to do a strength check or drop the axe.

560
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:09,927
MATT: It's a 29.

561
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:11,401
TALIESIN: He makes that strength check!

562
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,867
(laughter)

563
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,922
MATT: He had a natural 19.

564
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:18,781
TALIESIN: And, just for fun, I'll take one more
shot.

565
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,223
MATT: Go for it.

566
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:28,777
TALIESIN: That's 31 to hit, that hits. Nothing
fancy on this one, obviously, just the

567
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:34,825
old-fashioned-- 16 points of damage plus one point
of psychic damage.

568
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,646
MATT: Okay, nice.

569
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:44,064
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to use the rest of my
turn to, if possible, open that door and get

570
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:46,669
behind it for cover, of that room.

571
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:50,664
MATT: Okay, because you blew the lock off and the
door's somewhat ajar, we'll say you move it open

572
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:52,917
and get partially inside, that's as far as you can
get.

573
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,042
TALIESIN: I just want to use it for cover.

574
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:59,625
MATT: All right, so you get behind the door, and
you're ducking in the side there. Perfect. Okay.

575
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:12,149
At the end of your turn, Utugash is going to use a
legendary action to attack you.

576
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:13,528
NOELLE: Bring it.

577
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,069
SAM: Ursa Major.

578
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:17,165
NOELLE: That's my wrestling name.

579
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:20,771
MATT: That is going to be a 16 to hit. I think
that hits you because you have no armor on.

580
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,554
NOELLE: It hits. Yeah, I don't have no armor on.

581
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:31,206
MATT: So, as the giant axe swings towards you,
that's going to be 23 points of slashing damage

582
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:38,807
with the axe. However, that does trigger the
Mutual Suffering, so he takes 23 points of

583
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:46,081
necrotic damage from the impact. As the axe swings
and cuts across your bear chest, all of sudden,

584
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:50,813
where the blood bulged earlier, you watch a
secondary wound open simultaneously where no

585
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:55,181
weapon was apparently visible and blood begins to
just trickle out. Devil blood.

586
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:56,998
TRAVIS: Teach me.

587
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,712
LAURA: That. Was. Sick.

588
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:04,283
MATT: And he's going to use, as part of his last
legendary action, and does another maneuver with

589
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,840
his finger like that.

590
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,724
TALIESIN: He did another thing.

591
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:10,696
LAURA: He did another gesture? What gesture? What
did he do?

592
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:11,679
NOELLE: Oh, fuck!

593
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,559
TRAVIS: Same thing.

594
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,164
MATT: He did this.

595
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:14,138
LIAM: Gang sign, gang sign.

596
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:15,141
LAURA: Oh no, people are watching.

597
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:16,059
SAM: Was it this thing?

598
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:23,045
MATT: So, at the top of the round-- The only
people in the room right now, Keyleth is

599
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:28,221
face-first on the ground. I need Tova and Grog to
make perception checks, if you could.

600
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:31,201
LAURA: What about Trinket? Trinket's got a really
good sense of smell.

601
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,614
MATT: Have Trinket roll a perception check.

602
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:34,666
NOELLE: 17.

603
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:35,819
TRAVIS: Two!

604
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:46,966
LAURA: Wait, with his keen sense of smell-- Okay.
17 plus-- what does he add to it? Anything?

605
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:48,817
MATT: Whatever his perception bonus is.

606
00:38:48,817 --> 00:38:51,242
LAURA: Oh, wow! 17 plus nine. 26!

607
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:58,337
MATT: Trinket doesn't know why, but he's like
(sniffs). And you watch Trinket looking around the

608
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:03,299
room. The pit fiend is not alone. You don't know
where anything else is, but while the room appears

609
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,818
to be empty, Trinket is picking up other scents in
the room.

610
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:11,417
NOELLE: Can I talk to Trinket? Can I understand
Trinket?

611
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:14,186
MATT: (laughs) Sure.

612
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,687
LAURA: Yes!

613
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,203
MATT: Why not? Your bear form, you speak bear

614
00:39:18,203 --> 00:39:21,236
LAURA: Yes! Ah, I love this!

615
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,547
LIAM: Everybody buckle up.

616
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:25,954
MATT: "There's something here!"

617
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:27,783
(laughter)

618
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,632
MATT: (sniffs) "Two! Small."

619
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:34,635
NOELLE: There's two! Small!

620
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:37,359
TRAVIS: Why do you sound like a bear?

621
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:47,378
MATT: You hear the sound of grinding stone. You
don't see anything. Unfortunately, the low light

622
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:52,254
in here, and your not great perception, you don't
pick out any visual, other than-- a familiar sound

623
00:39:52,254 --> 00:40:01,239
to you, Grog-- as something in the ceiling opens
up, and suddenly searing hot oil comes spilling

624
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:11,606
from the ceiling, down onto both you, Trinket, and
Tova. I need you to make dexterity saves, Tova,

625
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:13,773
Trinket, and Grog.

626
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:26,403
LAURA: Don't fuck me Gil. Oh, Gil. Did he get an
advantage, though, because he sniffed out people?

627
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:27,363
MATT: Nope!

628
00:40:27,363 --> 00:40:28,386
LAURA: Damn it.

629
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:29,443
TRAVIS: Should've gone with Gil.

630
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:30,705
MATT: Three.

631
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:31,908
TRAVIS: Seven.

632
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:33,209
LAURA: Nine.

633
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:36,444
MATT: All right, that is 21 points of fire damage
to Trinket, Tova, and Grog.

634
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:37,557
LAURA: 29?

635
00:40:37,557 --> 00:40:38,557
MATT: 21 points of fire damage.

636
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:44,279
SAM: Does he take 21 points of fire damage?

637
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:46,859
TRAVIS: I am resistant to fire.

638
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,835
MATT: Devils have a strange thing called immunity
to fire damage.

639
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:53,755
SAM: Immunity? Not just resistance, immunity?

640
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:55,246
MATT: They're devils, man.

641
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,696
TRAVIS: So I'm resistant to fire, but this is
boiling oil, does that count?

642
00:40:57,696 --> 00:41:01,310
MATT: It's considered fire damage because it's the
heat that does it, so you take half of that. Put

643
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:14,312
you at ten. So as that's happening, as the oil
splashes down, you guys are tensing from the

644
00:41:14,312 --> 00:41:21,095
impact. Vax, you peer around the corner and you
hear (creaking), and you look to the other side

645
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:27,037
just as the portcullis has been lifted, and you
see coming out of the opposite side the chamber is

646
00:41:27,037 --> 00:41:36,592
one of the bone devils that you've seen wandering
in the street and is pouring from the other side.

647
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:45,012
Its claws come through. It's as wide as the
hallway, its jaw unhinges, its tongue slathering,

648
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:50,513
these small flapping insect-like wings across the
back of its scapula, its claws

649
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:51,812
reach out towards you.

650
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:54,654
LIAM: The rest of the party hears: ermagerd,
ermagerd, ermagerd!

651
00:41:54,654 --> 00:42:00,092
LAURA: Did you already ask if the pit fiend took
damage because you took damage?

652
00:42:00,092 --> 00:42:04,728
NOELLE: Oh, did he take damage from me? Was my
curse still in effect?

653
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:07,581
MATT: Once he takes the damage, the curse is up.
It's just for one hit.

654
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:11,177
NOELLE: Sorry. I tried my best.

655
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:18,704
MATT: But he took 23 free damage, which is nice.
Vax, he's going to take three attacks on you. That

656
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:22,307
is a 27.

657
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,678
LIAM: Yeah, that kind of hits.

658
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,994
MATT: All right, that is a 20.

659
00:42:25,994 --> 00:42:27,504
LIAM: That does not hit.

660
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:30,713
MATT: And with the tail, that is a 24.

661
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:34,577
LIAM: That also hits. I will use Uncanny Dodge for
the tail.

662
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:42,829
MATT: Okay. So the first claw hits you, you take
11 points of slashing damage, and as the first

663
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:47,847
claw strikes you across the chest, the second one,
you manage to duck right out of the way, it slams

664
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:51,761
into the stonework, and as you glance up, you try
and dodge and roll out of the way as the tail

665
00:42:51,817 --> 00:43:02,268
scrapes you across the back. That is 18 points of
piercing damage, reduced to six, and you would

666
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:05,747
have the possibility of becoming poisoned;
however, you guys are still under the effect of

667
00:43:05,747 --> 00:43:07,697
Heroes' Feast, so that does not affect you.

668
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:11,355
NOELLE: So his tail's poisoned?

669
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,129
MATT: Now it is Utugash's turn.

670
00:43:14,129 --> 00:43:17,451
NOELLE: Oh my god, that wasn't even his turn.

671
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:20,210
TRAVIS: That was the turn, right?

672
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:29,196
MATT: Utugash stands here with the axe and goes,
the mouth not moving, you just hear the voice

673
00:43:29,196 --> 00:43:37,814
echoing between your ears. It's sourceless and in
your face, "Now that we're all gathered around--"

674
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:44,667
There's a flash of red in the eyes and suddenly
the ground circling him erupts into flames. A wall

675
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:47,312
of fire is now currently circling the vicinity.

676
00:43:47,312 --> 00:43:49,104
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

677
00:43:49,104 --> 00:44:10,667
MATT: This entire column of 20 foot tall flames
encircle him and bursts up, singeing Grog,

678
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,410
Trinket, and Tova.

679
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,910
LAURA: Just singeing.

680
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,762
NOELLE: Seemed like such a good idea!

681
00:44:15,762 --> 00:44:18,182
LIAM: How high is the ceiling in that room?

682
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:20,261
MATT: It's about 25 feet.

683
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:21,856
LIAM: So there's a little space up top?

684
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:23,357
MATT: A little bit.

685
00:44:23,357 --> 00:44:25,933
LAURA: We can see through the fire.

686
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:32,965
MATT: You can't see through the fire, the fire
completely obscures your visual of him. All you

687
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:38,829
see is flames, and you see the vague shadows of
Tova, Grog, and Trinket, now currently engulfed in

688
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:46,365
them. I need you guys to all roll dexterity saving
throws.

689
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,935
LAURA: Natural 20!

690
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,962
MATT: Nice!

691
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:51,367
NOELLE: 15.

692
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,389
TRAVIS: God, son of a bitch. 12.

693
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:58,409
MATT: All righty, everyone but Trinket failed.

694
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:05,541
TRAVIS: What, a 15 and 12 don't make it?

695
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:09,953
MATT: 23 points of fire damage to Grog and Tova.

696
00:45:09,953 --> 00:45:11,476
TRAVIS: Resistant, so I got halved.

697
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:18,076
MATT: So that's 11 to you and Trinket. Trinket
takes 11. Currently nobody else has visual range.

698
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:28,635
You have no vision for Percy. Any ranged attacks,
you cannot see the creature. Utugash sits there in

699
00:45:28,635 --> 00:45:32,284
the flames surrounding him, seemingly not
interested in moving at the moment, enjoying the

700
00:45:32,284 --> 00:45:34,353
current position.

701
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:39,005
LAURA: How are we going to get him out of those
flames, man?

702
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:43,988
LIAM: Tary, you got some kind of Dispel Magic over
there?

703
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,602
SAM: I am so weak.

704
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:50,290
LAURA: Don't you have spells? You have so many
spells!

705
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,198
SAM: You guys want a window somewhere?

706
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:55,357
NOELLE: Could you put a window through him?

707
00:45:55,357 --> 00:45:57,654
And that would kill him.

708
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,287
TRAVIS: He's real strong.

709
00:46:00,464 --> 00:46:06,143
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use my bonus action
to cast Vow of Enmity on the bone devil.

710
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:09,621
MATT: All righty, Vow of Enmity is in play.

711
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:15,242
LIAM: Then I'm going to use one of my two actions,
I'm using an action to Disengage from the bone

712
00:46:15,297 --> 00:46:19,521
devil and dance back past Doty.

713
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:24,145
MATT: Dance back past Doty? All righty.

714
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:30,642
LIAM: And then I'm going to chuck a goddamn
Vestige at this motherfucker.

715
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:32,323
MATT: At the bone devil?

716
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:36,635
LIAM: At advantage. Oh, I rolled the same thing on
both. 24 to hit.

717
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:37,778
MATT: That hits.

718
00:46:37,778 --> 00:46:45,748
LIAM: Okay, so, he's going to get it. Right, here
we go. Two plus eight is ten, plus--

719
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:47,380
SAM: How tall is the room?

720
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,726
MATT: About 25 feet tall.

721
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:50,819
SAM: So there's a little window on top.

722
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:54,459
MATT: A little four or five foot gap, very small.

723
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,715
SAM: Okay.

724
00:46:55,715 --> 00:47:00,006
TALIESIN: I already like it. This is a beautiful
glimmer in your eye. I'm excited.

725
00:47:00,006 --> 00:47:01,420
SAM: Well, it's something, isn't it?

726
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:09,941
LIAM: 38, and I will Smite him as well. 52.

727
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:17,226
MATT: 52 points of damage. Nice. As you throw the
dagger, as the creature watches you dart past, it

728
00:47:17,226 --> 00:47:21,853
streaks out to try and strike at you, but you're
already gone. As you turn around, you throw the

729
00:47:21,853 --> 00:47:27,778
dagger. It strikes right into the chest of the
bone devil, as it bursts with this dark

730
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:35,300
grayish-white light indicative of the Raven
Queen's direct impact. As it bursts, you watch as

731
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,390
part of the flesh tears open, showing the dark
bluish purple sinew and muscle beneath, and the

732
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:45,500
devil just (growls).

733
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,639
TRAVIS: Get out of that hallway!

734
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,640
LIAM: That's it, I'm done.

735
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,101
MATT: That brings us to Vex.

736
00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:55,887
LAURA: Okay. So I'm going to come up in front of
the window.

737
00:47:55,887 --> 00:48:04,627
MATT: Okay. You glance in and you just see fire
and the butt of Trinket sticking out of the fire.

738
00:48:04,627 --> 00:48:05,693
LAURA: Great.

739
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:06,977
MARISHA: And my feet.

740
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:08,452
MATT: Yeah, just up in the air, kicking.

741
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:12,131
LAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark the pit fiend?

742
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:14,489
MATT: You can't see it.

743
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:22,469
LAURA: That's fine. I know where he was, right?
Trinket is facing him, so can I try to shoot him

744
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:24,858
with an arrow, anyway?

745
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:34,838
MATT: I'll say, you have no visual on him. You can
go ahead and shoot. Go for it, try it.

746
00:48:34,894 --> 00:48:36,234
Disadvantage.

747
00:48:36,234 --> 00:48:37,824
LAURA: I have Sharpshooter, I don't know if that
helps at all.

748
00:48:37,824 --> 00:48:39,378
MATT: No, he's completely covered.

749
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:47,205
LAURA: Okay, let's try this out. Those are
being aggressive. The lower of the

750
00:48:47,205 --> 00:48:51,546
two rolls was 29.

751
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:56,885
MATT: Okay. You watch as you fire your arrow and
it disintegrates upon touching the wall of fire.

752
00:48:56,885 --> 00:49:00,394
The actual shaft burns as it impacts in the
flames.

753
00:49:00,394 --> 00:49:01,784
LAURA: Okay.

754
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:03,632
NOELLE: You should've used your fire-proof
arrows.

755
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:12,588
LAURA: I know, right? Those fire-proof arrows.
Great. If I shot an arrow from a Blazing Bowstring

756
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:16,713
so it was already a fire arrow, you think it would
go through?

757
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:17,800
MATT: Give it a shot.

758
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,774
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do that.

759
00:49:18,774 --> 00:49:24,811
MATT: Okay. So, second attack, Blazing Bowstring,
go ahead and roll with disadvantage.

760
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:26,427
LAURA: 19.

761
00:49:26,427 --> 00:49:33,459
MATT: 19. You go ahead and fire. It isn't consumed
by the flames, but the arrow you hear exit the

762
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:36,678
other side and then ricochet off the far wall and
miss the creature's target.

763
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:41,981
LAURA: Well, it could have been cool. Okay.
Trinket is going to use his bonus action to try to

764
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:45,742
attack him, even though he's not magical and he's
a little piece of shit.

765
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:48,389
MATT: All right, go for it.

766
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:53,866
LAURA: That is a 26.

767
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,150
MATT: 26 does hit.

768
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,758
LAURA: Yeah, go Trinket.

769
00:49:57,758 --> 00:49:59,134
TRAVIS: Come on, Trink.

770
00:49:59,134 --> 00:50:02,632
LAURA: Yeah, that's good, too! That's a 15.

771
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:11,141
MATT: 15. Halve that to seven, seven points of
slashing damage across. Through the fire, still

772
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,613
bravely fighting into it.

773
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:17,416
LAURA: Yeah. And I'm going to tell Trinket, back
the fuck out of the fire, Trinket!

774
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:18,839
MATT: That's a good plan.

775
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,672
LAURA: What are you doing? Stop attacking! Get out
of the fire!

776
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:22,520
MATT: Backs up and gets out of the flames, backing
up against the wall.

777
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,478
LAURA: Yeah. And then I'm going to back away from
the window.

778
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:25,720
MATT: All right.

779
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,231
LAURA: I'm going to back away from the window.

780
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:30,590
MATT: Where do you want Trinket to land, by the
way?

781
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:36,508
LAURA: Just into the corner, like where the angle
of the wall is.

782
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:37,894
MATT: Over there?

783
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:38,865
LAURA: Yeah, right there.

784
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:39,802
MATT: Okay.

785
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,492
LAURA: And I'm going to back away from the window
to where he doesn't have visual on me.

786
00:50:42,492 --> 00:50:45,421
MATT: You back out of the way of the window, over
here?

787
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:46,339
LAURA: Yeah.

788
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:50,157
MATT: Okay. As Trinket backs into that corner, I
need Trinket to go ahead and make a dexterity

789
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:51,177
saving throw.

790
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:52,203
LAURA: Of course.

791
00:50:52,203 --> 00:50:54,223
NOELLE: Come on, Trinket, come on.

792
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:55,125
LAURA: Come on, Trink!

793
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,393
TRAVIS, NOELLE, AND LAURA: Aww.

794
00:50:56,393 --> 00:51:00,403
LAURA: It almost was really good, but it wasn't.
Six!

795
00:51:00,403 --> 00:51:09,840
MATT: A giant cage falls from the ceiling of
heated metal and lands on him, filled with spikes

796
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:22,157
and (sad bear noises). You hear Trinket yell from
the other side. Trinket takes seven points of

797
00:51:22,157 --> 00:51:24,676
piercing damage.

798
00:51:24,676 --> 00:51:26,801
LAURA: You did that to an animal!

799
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:28,982
MARISHA: You don't fuck with a ranger's bear!

800
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:34,025
MATT: And six points of fire damage from the
heated metal, and Trinket is currently restrained,

801
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,895
has to try and break free to get out.

802
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:37,968
LAURA: You're evil.

803
00:51:37,968 --> 00:51:46,401
MATT: Nope, Utugash is evil. There is a definite
distinction.

804
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:50,641
TRAVIS: Mr. Mercer, we pulled you over for
speeding tonight. (different voice) No, I wasn't

805
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:54,461
speeding tonight. The pit fiend was speeding.

806
00:51:54,461 --> 00:52:03,808
MATT: It's important, guys. All righty, so. That
ends your turn, Vex. Taryon, you're up.

807
00:52:03,808 --> 00:52:05,498
SAM: Jesus.

808
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,924
TRAVIS: Fix everything.

809
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:07,954
LAURA: Make it better.

810
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:14,723
SAM: I'm nobody! Is it just a cage or is there a
door on the bear cage?

811
00:52:14,723 --> 00:52:21,731
MATT: It looks like there is no visible door,
you'd have to tear it off of him.

812
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:28,909
SAM: That's not going to happen. Okay, our last
fight, I had hasted myself. That was more than a

813
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:30,905
minute ago, though, right?

814
00:52:30,905 --> 00:52:38,099
MATT: I'd say it's about halfway done. This has
all happened pretty quickly, because as soon as

815
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:43,294
the battle started with the cambion that you guys
chased out, every round thereafter, it's still

816
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:46,595
going. So you still have five more rounds of
Haste.

817
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:53,490
SAM: Okay, well then, I'll go into the place.

818
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:57,343
MATT: Okay, you jump over the window. Keyleth
breaks your fall.

819
00:52:57,343 --> 00:53:06,033
SAM: Oh. Sorry! It's hard to see with my helmet!
No peripheral vision.

820
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:11,714
MATT: Yeah, and you see a column of flame just
flickering and burning in the center of the room.

821
00:53:11,783 --> 00:53:17,090
Occasionally, you see a wing tip carve through the
top as the creature is moving

822
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,661
within the wall of fire.

823
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:20,057
SAM: Oh my god.

824
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:21,964
NOELLE: (laughs) Do you have a fire extinguisher?

825
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:27,693
SAM: No! I don't have anything! How far can I
move, hasted?

826
00:53:27,693 --> 00:53:30,326
MATT: Double your movement.

827
00:53:30,326 --> 00:53:35,304
SAM: You just double your movement. Okay. So my
movement's 30, so I can move in there with him?

828
00:53:35,304 --> 00:53:37,120
MATT: If you wanted to, yeah.

829
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,900
SAM: Okay. I'm just going to go, (yells) and run
into the fire.

830
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:47,733
MATT: You rush into the flames. I need you to roll
a dexterity saving throw.

831
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:58,912
SAM: Advantage on dexterity saves. Oh. All right,
no. That's nine.

832
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:00,584
MATT: 30 points of fire damage.

833
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:01,831
SAM: Halved.

834
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:03,944
MATT: Halved because of?

835
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,764
SAM: My Helm of Brilliance.

836
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:11,012
MATT: That's true. There you go. So 15 points of
fire damage to you, Taryon. As you rush through,

837
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:17,832
you're like, "Hah!" The fire was enough, and you
sit there and look right up on this massive, like,

838
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:23,784
swollen devilish entity with giant red leathery
wings, lower jaw with hooked tusks that stick out

839
00:54:23,784 --> 00:54:30,766
the bottom, gleaming yellow piercing eyes, giant
horns that curl up from the brow, a giant axe in

840
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:36,428
one hand and the other hand just points at you and
goes, "Hi." in the center of your head.

841
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:41,013
SAM: I'm just going to say, "Hi. It's a little
warm in here. Here, cool off."

842
00:54:41,013 --> 00:54:42,766
And I'll throw acid on him.

843
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:45,453
(laughter)

844
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:49,298
MATT: All right, go ahead and make the attack.

845
00:54:49,298 --> 00:54:56,748
SAM: I don't know what I'm rolling. 14. This is to
hit? It's magic? I don't know,

846
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:58,044
how does this work?

847
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,883
MATT: Well, no-- hold on.

848
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:02,243
SAM: It's a vial of acid.

849
00:55:02,243 --> 00:55:06,040
MATT: I'm going to pull up your class here, just
to check it out.

850
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,948
SAM: I never know if this is a spell attack bonus
sort of a thing.

851
00:55:10,948 --> 00:55:14,301
MATT: When you throw it, they have to make a
saving throw. So what's your DC?

852
00:55:14,301 --> 00:55:16,485
SAM: The DC of the spell is 17.

853
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:23,295
MATT: 17. Okay, and it requires a saving throw.
Because it's the acid.

854
00:55:23,295 --> 00:55:25,864
LAURA: I like how the music stopped while we
figure this out.

855
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:31,966
MATT: It's dexterity. Okay. That is 17.

856
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:35,667
SAM: So he resists it completely.

857
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:39,689
MATT: Creature must succeed or take-- yeah, he
resists it entirely.

858
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,114
LAURA: Balls!

859
00:55:41,114 --> 00:55:42,326
MATT: Yeah, sorry.

860
00:55:42,326 --> 00:55:43,655
SAM: No problem.

861
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:49,294
MATT: So as you throw it, it hits the edge of the
horn and just shatters and breaks behind it.

862
00:55:49,294 --> 00:55:57,725
SAM: Oh. All right. I think I get a bonus still,
maybe?

863
00:55:57,725 --> 00:56:00,033
MATT: You do have a bonus.

864
00:56:00,033 --> 00:56:02,868
SAM: I will cast Sanctuary on myself.

865
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:08,179
MATT: What you do is you have an extra attack-- as
Haste you get your action.

866
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:09,985
SAM: Okay, that was my action.

867
00:56:09,985 --> 00:56:12,562
MATT: That was your action. You have another
action to do a melee attack if you want to.

868
00:56:12,562 --> 00:56:14,710
SAM: Ooh, okay. I will stab him with my lance.

869
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,033
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for an attack. So yeah,
as hasted, you get the additional attack.

870
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:23,291
SAM: Ooh, that's going to hit. It's a 25.

871
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:27,250
MATT: That hits, actually. Go ahead and roll the
damage. And it is a magical weapon, so he's not

872
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,386
resistant to it.

873
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:30,373
TRAVIS: What sound do you make when you hit him?

874
00:56:30,373 --> 00:56:31,762
SAM: (high-pitched grunt)

875
00:56:31,762 --> 00:56:34,957
(laughter)

876
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:38,431
SAM: Like a breathy (grunts).

877
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:41,154
TRAVIS: Work on your war face.

878
00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:48,593
SAM: That's 1d12. Thank you very much. That's
seven.

879
00:56:48,593 --> 00:56:51,061
LAURA: Do you add anything to it?

880
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:56,414
SAM: No wait, I get a plus six. Ooh, and it was a
six! That's 13.

881
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,424
MATT: Is that fire damage?

882
00:56:58,424 --> 00:57:01,292
SAM: No, the fire damage is another plus one, but
I don't think you'll be adding that.

883
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,382
MATT: No.

884
00:57:02,382 --> 00:57:04,519
SAM: (laughs) Yeah, so 13.

885
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:09,479
MATT: 13 points of damage against the pit fiend as
you stab it and you can cast Sanctuary on yourself

886
00:57:09,479 --> 00:57:10,532
as your bonus.

887
00:57:10,532 --> 00:57:18,232
SAM: I will, and as I do that I also say, Doty--
remember how I said back up Grog? Me! Back up me!

888
00:57:18,232 --> 00:57:20,099
(laughter)

889
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:28,998
MATT: As Doty charges forward and rushes in. I
need Doty to make a dexterity saving throw.

890
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:34,997
SAM: Oh no. 16 plus-- what's his dexterity?--
zero, so 16.

891
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:38,378
MATT: Doty takes 30 points of fire damage.

892
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:40,654
SAM: (groans) He's unconscious.

893
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:42,371
MARISHA: Already?

894
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:48,196
SAM: I don't know when the last time we rested was
but I have down that he only has 30 hit points

895
00:57:48,196 --> 00:57:50,426
left. Did he take damage at some point?

896
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:54,744
MATT: Well because he hurt himself going through
the metal outside. So Doty comes

897
00:57:54,744 --> 00:58:05,950
rushing in and goes (impact sound) and just
collapses on the ground next to you, superheated.

898
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:07,404
(sizzling noise)

899
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:09,364
SAM: Oh no! Is he going to melt?

900
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:10,643
MATT: You don't think so.

901
00:58:10,643 --> 00:58:11,874
SAM: He's in the fire, right?

902
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:13,156
MATT: He's in the fire, yeah.

903
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:18,319
SAM: Oh god. Is he making some sort of window that
someone else could walk over?

904
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:26,450
MATT: No, the flames curl around, sorry. All
right, so that ends Taryon's turn.

905
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,754
SAM: Good, I'm glad I used that last little
thing.

906
00:58:28,754 --> 00:58:31,678
(laughter)

907
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,707
SAM: Killed my best friend.

908
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:36,082
LAURA: Tary, it's your only friend!

909
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:41,544
MATT: At the end of the turn, the pit fiend sticks
a hand out of the flames and does this motion.

910
00:58:41,544 --> 00:58:45,335
Make a perception check again, Grog.

911
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:46,604
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

912
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:49,235
MATT: And Tova, both you guys.

913
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,486
TRAVIS: 14.

914
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,920
LIAM: Tova fire.

915
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,970
NOELLE: A 17.

916
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:59,440
MATT: 17, okay. Still not quite noticing anything,
but you're starting to notice that there are these

917
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:08,199
small, inset stone circles on the wall behind him,
over in this area. And you watch as two of them go

918
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:11,016
(stone grinding) and get pressed in by
themselves.

919
00:59:11,016 --> 00:59:13,112
TRAVIS: Into the wall, or out from the wall?

920
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:19,194
MATT: Into the wall. Like something just pressed
this giant, circular stone button-- separately.

921
00:59:19,194 --> 00:59:24,658
TRAVIS: We're in an engine.

922
00:59:24,739 --> 00:59:35,941
MATT: So Vax, where you are, the floor, you hear a
(click), like something releasing. I need you to

923
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:38,173
make a dexterity saving throw.

924
00:59:38,173 --> 00:59:42,936
LIAM: Oh well, I'm good. I'm fine, I'm at
advantage. Hopefully that's good. Not that good.

925
00:59:42,936 --> 00:59:45,050
LAURA: Oh my god. Can you use Luck?

926
00:59:45,098 --> 00:59:48,731
LIAM: No, hold on. This is dexterity.

927
00:59:48,731 --> 00:59:51,984
TRAVIS: It might be balloon animals, don't sweat
it yet.

928
00:59:51,984 --> 00:59:54,842
LIAM: Oh man, it's not great. It's 16.

929
00:59:54,911 --> 00:59:56,291
LAURA: Use Luck.

930
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:59,598
LIAM: I think I have one left? I think I have one
left. So I'm going to use it.

931
00:59:59,598 --> 01:00:01,419
MATT: All right, go for it.

932
01:00:01,419 --> 01:00:04,205
LIAM: Oh, that's better. That is 25.

933
01:00:04,451 --> 01:00:14,233
MATT: 25 is enough. The ground suddenly hinges out
from under you, and you leap up and jam your

934
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:20,111
blades into each side of the wall and put your
foot out to the side, and it's almost not enough

935
01:00:20,111 --> 01:00:25,371
to press into the small space, but you just barely
catch yourself, Van Damme-style, on each side. The

936
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:30,494
bone demon across from you, its wings flare up as
the ground tumbles out from under you. You see

937
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:39,265
about ten feet below you a pool of molten iron
that is just (burbling). It stays open, swinging

938
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:42,892
for a few seconds, before it closes once more
beneath you.

939
01:00:42,892 --> 01:00:44,732
LIAM: Good to know.

940
01:00:44,732 --> 01:00:46,681
MARISHA: I'm really glad you used that Luck!

941
01:00:46,681 --> 01:00:51,193
TRAVIS: How do you know it's not molten steel?
Kidding.

942
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:59,592
MATT: One way to find out. That brings us to
Keyleth.

943
01:00:59,592 --> 01:01:05,960
MARISHA: Oh, jeez! Okay. I roll over.

944
01:01:06,016 --> 01:01:09,022
MATT: You stand up and see Trinket currently
trapped in the cage next to you just whining

945
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:10,768
(sad bear whimpers).

946
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:20,147
MARISHA: It's okay, buddy! Just hang on. Tsunami
coming though, look out! I'm going to do a Tidal

947
01:01:20,147 --> 01:01:36,157
Wave and go (bwoosh). Do you have the laser
pointer? What are these red pools of things?

948
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:38,104
LAURA: That's molten blood, he said.

949
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:40,064
MARISHA: It's molten blood?

950
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:45,983
MATT: All right, so you're doing Tidal Wave.

951
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:52,016
MARISHA: I want to try and avoid my friends. It's
ten-foot-wide.

952
01:01:52,016 --> 01:01:56,009
TRAVIS: If you've got to, you know who to aim it
at.

953
01:01:56,009 --> 01:02:01,722
MARISHA: In fact, there's a ten-foot gap, right,
Matt? Between everybody? Right up front?

954
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:05,246
MATT: Right up front there's a little bit of a gap
there, and Doty is on the ground,

955
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:06,367
you can step on Doty.

956
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:11,808
MARISHA: It's ten foot, right? Can I do my Tidal
Wave from this direction backwards?

957
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:14,520
MATT: How wide is the Tidal Wave?

958
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,677
MARISHA: Ten feet.

959
01:02:15,677 --> 01:02:17,097
MATT: It's still going to hit somebody.

960
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:18,596
MARISHA: Who's it going to hit?

961
01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:22,026
MATT: There's five feet between Taryon and Tova,
and--

962
01:02:22,026 --> 01:02:28,972
TRAVIS: Either me or Taryon. I mean, Doty. Or
whoever.

963
01:02:28,972 --> 01:02:43,229
MARISHA: I know Grog is dextrous, so Grog can take
it. Sorry, Grog. But I want to start here and go

964
01:02:43,229 --> 01:02:47,455
backwards. Towards you.

965
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:51,695
MATT: Towards me? So this way. Okay. You're
choosing Taryon?

966
01:02:51,695 --> 01:02:53,929
MARISHA: No, Grog, to get hit.

967
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:56,389
MATT: So, this way?

968
01:02:56,389 --> 01:03:01,895
MARISHA: Yeah. It's a ten-foot-wide column that I
just want to go back.

969
01:03:01,895 --> 01:03:06,835
MATT: Right. In order for it to hit the pit fiend?
It's going to hit either Taryon--

970
01:03:06,835 --> 01:03:08,324
MARISHA: Or Grog!

971
01:03:08,324 --> 01:03:11,222
MATT: No, because Grog's far off to the side-- If
it comes back this way,

972
01:03:11,222 --> 01:03:12,429
it's just going to hit Grog.

973
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:15,468
MARISHA: Sorry, I was confused, when you said
Grog. So who's it going to hit?

974
01:03:15,468 --> 01:03:19,975
MATT: It's going to hit either Taryon, or it's
going to have to hit Tova and Doty.

975
01:03:19,975 --> 01:03:26,378
NOELLE: Do what you've got to do.

976
01:03:26,378 --> 01:03:28,217
MARISHA: Tova.

977
01:03:28,217 --> 01:03:33,780
NOELLE: Sorry I pushed you out a window.

978
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,983
(laughter)

979
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,662
MATT: I need Tova to make a dexterity saving
throw.

980
01:03:37,662 --> 01:03:41,840
MARISHA: Only because I think she's more dextrous
than him.

981
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,243
NOELLE: That is 11.

982
01:03:45,243 --> 01:03:46,592
MATT: What is it?

983
01:03:46,592 --> 01:03:48,122
NOELLE: 11.

984
01:03:48,122 --> 01:03:52,375
MATT: That's not going to work for a spell DC.
However, Utugash does not make the save either!

985
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:58,892
With a roll of a six plus eight, that is a 14. So,
that's 4d8 bludgeoning damage,

986
01:03:58,892 --> 01:04:00,823
go ahead and roll that.

987
01:04:00,823 --> 01:04:02,621
SAM: Oh man. Kill our own guest?

988
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:11,878
MARISHA: No, it's not that much. Five, six,
seven-- Ten, and a reroll, I do an eight! So

989
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:14,819
that's eight-- 23 damage, thank you.

990
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:16,008
MATT: Okay.

991
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:18,065
MARISHA: And he should be knocked prone--

992
01:04:18,065 --> 01:04:19,842
SAM: That's not a seven.

993
01:04:19,842 --> 01:04:27,733
MARISHA: No, it's an eight. Wait, five, seven,
that's 10, 18. 18 damage.

994
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:28,823
MATT: Okay.

995
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,235
MARISHA: And he's knocked prone.

996
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:32,584
MATT: As is Tova.

997
01:04:32,584 --> 01:04:35,927
MARISHA: And then the water spreads across the
ground in all directions, and extinguishes

998
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:39,007
unprotected flames in an area within 30 feet of
it?

999
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:40,751
MATT: Correct!

1000
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:43,666
MARISHA: That's all I cared about, mainly?

1001
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:47,853
MATT: So, the water (whoosh), and the wall of fire
in that one section (sputtering, fire roaring back

1002
01:04:47,853 --> 01:04:55,638
to life). Unfortunately, the enchantment continues
to produce flames once the spell disseminates the

1003
01:04:55,638 --> 01:05:00,165
water. The nature of the spell is it perpetually
conjures fire. So, there is a brief moment where

1004
01:05:00,165 --> 01:05:04,936
it causes a gap, and the flames pick up once more.
He is knocked prone, he took damage.

1005
01:05:04,936 --> 01:05:10,066
MARISHA: Okay. I tried. Sorry, guys.

1006
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:13,217
MATT: Are you going to move, or are you going to
stay where you are, Keyleth?

1007
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:19,077
MARISHA: I'm going to back up as-- Can I crawl? Do
I have enough movement to crawl back through the

1008
01:05:19,077 --> 01:05:19,932
window?

1009
01:05:19,932 --> 01:05:20,895
MATT: You do.

1010
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,775
MARISHA: I'll do that.

1011
01:05:21,775 --> 01:05:23,520
MATT: So you go back there, and you can move right
back, around--

1012
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,664
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to keep it, use it as like
cover.

1013
01:05:26,664 --> 01:05:31,781
MATT: Okay. That ends Keyleth's turn. Tova. Grog.

1014
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:40,011
NOELLE: Took some damage. Little bit. But I'm
prone.

1015
01:05:40,011 --> 01:05:42,845
MATT: So you can get up and use half your
movement.

1016
01:05:42,845 --> 01:05:52,958
NOELLE: Okay, I've got to make a wisdom saving
throw to not attack anyone.

1017
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,986
MATT: Are you under half health?

1018
01:05:54,986 --> 01:05:58,518
NOELLE: Yes, I am. Oh! I actually did it! Okay,
it's fine, don't worry!

1019
01:05:58,518 --> 01:06:00,914
False alarm, everything's fine!

1020
01:06:00,914 --> 01:06:02,849
MATT: So you maintain control.

1021
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:09,816
NOELLE: Don't worry about it! We'll deal with it
later when it comes up!

1022
01:06:09,816 --> 01:06:11,674
SAM: What would've happened to me?!

1023
01:06:11,674 --> 01:06:22,685
NOELLE: No, everything's fine! We're good! So, if
I stand up, that takes half my turn?

1024
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:23,921
MATT: Half your movement.

1025
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:25,783
NOELLE: Okay. Well, I'm going to stand up.

1026
01:06:25,783 --> 01:06:27,863
MATT: You're still in the flames, currently.

1027
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,182
NOELLE: Well, that's not good.

1028
01:06:29,182 --> 01:06:31,665
MATT: You can take your turn and then back out of
the flames, if you wanted to.

1029
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:39,689
NOELLE: I'm going to use my Crimson Rite to light
up my claws.

1030
01:06:39,689 --> 01:06:41,927
MATT: With what type of--

1031
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:47,528
NOELLE: With frozen. Does that help me with fire
at all? Can I bat the flames

1032
01:06:47,528 --> 01:06:49,242
away with my icy paws?

1033
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:50,514
MATT: Your hands feel more comfortable.

1034
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:51,652
NOELLE: Okay.

1035
01:06:51,652 --> 01:06:53,440
(laughter)

1036
01:06:53,499 --> 01:07:01,463
MATT: Where once was these giant bear claws, you
watch as mystic ice gathers around them, turning

1037
01:07:01,463 --> 01:07:04,388
into longer razors that extend from your regular
claws.

1038
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:07,932
NOELLE: All right; I'm going to come to this guy,
and--

1039
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:09,804
LAURA: Eat it, Utugash!

1040
01:07:09,804 --> 01:07:16,535
NOELLE: My claw attacks with the Rite, does that
increase--

1041
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:20,175
MATT: Not to hit, but it does an additional 1d8
cold damage per strike.

1042
01:07:20,175 --> 01:07:23,087
NOELLE: All right. That's a 26.

1043
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:24,046
MATT: That hits.

1044
01:07:24,046 --> 01:07:27,376
LAURA: Do you get advantage because he's prone?

1045
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,608
MATT: You do get advantage because he's prone--

1046
01:07:29,608 --> 01:07:31,860
NOELLE: 24.

1047
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,934
MATT: That hits.

1048
01:07:32,934 --> 01:07:35,952
The third attack, if you want to use your
bonus-- You already used your bonus, you only get

1049
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:38,738
two. Both hit! Roll damage.

1050
01:07:38,738 --> 01:07:48,536
NOELLE: All right. That is a 13. And that's a 15.

1051
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:53,825
MATT: Add 2d8 cold damage to that as well, because
of your Crimson Rite.

1052
01:07:53,825 --> 01:08:00,648
NOELLE: 2d8. Can I use my Great Weapon to reroll
my one, here?

1053
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:01,868
MATT: Yeah.

1054
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:07,241
NOELLE: That is a four and a five. So, nine.

1055
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:14,770
MATT: Nice! That's a total of 37 points of damage
in two strikes.

1056
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,903
Do you want to back out of the flames?

1057
01:08:16,903 --> 01:08:18,400
NOELLE: Yeah, that'd be good.

1058
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:24,988
MATT: You can get that far out of the way. You
back up just out of the fire. Look over, and

1059
01:08:24,988 --> 01:08:31,560
there's another bear chained in that place. That
ends your turn. Grog.

1060
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:40,615
TRAVIS: Osh kosh magosh, it's time for hammers.
Can I advance through the

1061
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:43,247
ring of fire and on him more?

1062
01:08:43,247 --> 01:08:49,232
MATT: Unfortunately, because of both of your
sizes, you cannot advance into the ring. He takes

1063
01:08:49,232 --> 01:08:54,167
up too much space. You're either standing right in
the middle of the ring and just taking it, or

1064
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:55,662
you're going to have to back out of it.

1065
01:08:55,662 --> 01:08:57,450
LAURA: What if you jump on him?

1066
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:00,305
MATT: You can try, if you want to.

1067
01:09:00,305 --> 01:09:02,306
LAURA: You could jump on him!

1068
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:09,559
TRAVIS: That's not actually a terrible idea.
Because at the worst I just fall off one side or

1069
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:14,225
the other into the boiling blood-- I'll just stay
in the ring of fire. I don't want to test the

1070
01:09:14,225 --> 01:09:21,644
Sriracha pit just yet. Because he's prone, do I
get advantage on the attacks

1071
01:09:21,644 --> 01:09:23,056
without having to use Reckless?

1072
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:23,956
MATT: Correct.

1073
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:26,707
TRAVIS: Can I make all three of my frenzied
attacks?

1074
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:28,096
MATT: You may.

1075
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:37,578
TRAVIS: With advantage. 35 for the first one.

1076
01:09:37,578 --> 01:09:39,533
MATT: That hits.

1077
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:43,700
TRAVIS: Which is ten, 20. 26?

1078
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,481
MATT: That hits.

1079
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:51,895
TRAVIS: Nice. That's 29?

1080
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:53,534
MATT: Yeah.

1081
01:09:53,534 --> 01:10:04,459
TRAVIS: Ten. 26 again. 26 points of damage. 19.
C'mon, 37.

1082
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:08,647
MATT: Ooh, all righty.

1083
01:10:08,702 --> 01:10:11,110
TRAVIS: That's 22 points of damage.

1084
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:14,203
MATT: 22 points of damage, all right.

1085
01:10:14,203 --> 01:10:19,896
TRAVIS: Can I use my Action Surge?

1086
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:23,012
MATT: You may.

1087
01:10:23,012 --> 01:10:26,429
LAURA: Did you take something?

1088
01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:31,491
TRAVIS: Second level in Fighter. Groggy got two
more hits.

1089
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:37,532
MATT: That's five attacks in one round.

1090
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:41,426
TRAVIS: I can only do it one time. That's a 23.

1091
01:10:41,426 --> 01:10:42,675
MATT: That hits.

1092
01:10:42,675 --> 01:10:55,558
TRAVIS: 25 points of damage. And that's 29. Hits?

1093
01:10:55,558 --> 01:10:56,878
MATT: (high-pitched) Yeah.

1094
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,883
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

1095
01:10:59,957 --> 01:11:04,069
LAURA: How much damage did he just do with one
turn?

1096
01:11:04,069 --> 01:11:06,421
MATT: He did over a hundred.

1097
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:07,886
TRAVIS: But I'm cooking.

1098
01:11:07,886 --> 01:11:10,237
MATT: You're staying where you are?

1099
01:11:10,237 --> 01:11:14,950
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're really strong hits because
I'm burning while I'm doing it. Literally whaling

1100
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:16,939
through the fire and just angry.

1101
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,361
MATT: Make your dexterity saving throw.

1102
01:11:19,361 --> 01:11:25,257
TRAVIS: Advantage on that. That sucks, that's a
seven. I have resistance to fire, it's okay.

1103
01:11:25,257 --> 01:11:27,872
MATT: 28 points of fire damage. Reduced to half,
14.

1104
01:11:27,872 --> 01:11:29,632
TRAVIS: 14, thank you.

1105
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:34,223
MATT: All right, that ends Grog's turn. Percival.

1106
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:40,811
TALIESIN: If he's prone, does that mean that
negates the difficulty to hit through the ring?

1107
01:11:40,811 --> 01:11:46,669
MATT: Well, ranged attacks against prone creatures
have disadvantage, naturally, and you can't even

1108
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:49,212
see him, you have no visual range. You don't even
know that he's prone.

1109
01:11:49,212 --> 01:11:50,330
TALIESIN: So that's a mess.

1110
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:50,967
MATT: Yeah.

1111
01:11:50,967 --> 01:11:52,937
TRAVIS: I still have my movement, can I move out
of the ring?

1112
01:11:52,937 --> 01:11:55,968
MATT: I was asking if you wanted to do that or
not.

1113
01:11:55,968 --> 01:11:58,881
TRAVIS: Oh, I would like to, after all the smashing
is done.

1114
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:04,210
MATT: You move out and do not take the last bit of
fire damage. You take that when you end your turn

1115
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:07,624
in the fire. How far do you back up? Just out of
the range?

1116
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:09,438
TRAVIS: Just on the cusp of it.

1117
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:10,546
MATT: You step out of it.

1118
01:12:10,546 --> 01:12:14,458
LAURA: Not to the other corner where there's
probably--

1119
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:15,900
TRAVIS: Probably not.

1120
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,716
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think I can see that Vax is
having a little bit of a problem.

1121
01:12:19,716 --> 01:12:21,730
MATT: You can glance to the side, yeah.

1122
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:25,205
TALIESIN: There's a window in the door. I'm going
to swing around the other side of that door really

1123
01:12:25,205 --> 01:12:30,338
quickly. Perch on the wall right over there and
I'm going to take a couple shots at

1124
01:12:30,338 --> 01:12:34,574
Mr. Skelly Skellington.

1125
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:36,222
MATT: Go for it.

1126
01:12:36,222 --> 01:12:40,032
SAM: You're not just in the closet over there
sorting through file cabinets?

1127
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:44,873
TALIESIN: No, I was tempted to see if it was
anything-- We've got him on tax evasion.

1128
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:50,698
(laughter)

1129
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:54,735
I was hoping we would find a person in there,
I'll keep digging. Okay so first shot I'm

1130
01:12:54,735 --> 01:13:00,020
going to burn a Grit for a torso push.

1131
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,966
MATT: Okay.

1132
01:13:01,966 --> 01:13:14,717
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to add Hex to that,
just for fun. I'm going to Hex him.

1133
01:13:14,717 --> 01:13:16,443
MATT: Okay, cool.

1134
01:13:16,443 --> 01:13:22,861
TALIESIN: That's 23 to hit.

1135
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,495
MATT: 23 hits.

1136
01:13:24,495 --> 01:13:36,813
TALIESIN: That's 14 points of damage, two points
of psychic damage and five points of necrotic. He

1137
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:45,323
also has disadvantage on constitution-- checks.
And he's pushed ten feet back.

1138
01:13:45,323 --> 01:13:49,393
MATT: (slams) up against the wall there.

1139
01:13:49,393 --> 01:13:51,872
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot him two more times.

1140
01:13:51,872 --> 01:13:54,306
TRAVIS: Is the portcullis closed behind you?

1141
01:13:54,306 --> 01:13:58,546
MATT: The portcullis is currently closed. As soon
as he pushed through it.

1142
01:13:58,546 --> 01:14:06,139
TALIESIN: Second shot, I'm going to burn one more
Grit and I'm going to try for a head shot. Which

1143
01:14:06,139 --> 01:14:08,627
will give him disadvantage on next round's
attacks.

1144
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:10,650
MATT: Okay.

1145
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:14,132
TALIESIN: 24 to hit.

1146
01:14:14,132 --> 01:14:15,713
MATT: 24 hits.

1147
01:14:15,713 --> 01:14:22,889
TALIESIN: That's 11 points of normal damage, five
points of psychic damage and two points of

1148
01:14:22,889 --> 01:14:33,155
necrotic-- piercing damage. He has to save against
a constitution saving throw. Against 20.

1149
01:14:33,155 --> 01:14:37,782
MATT: That is a 16.

1150
01:14:37,782 --> 01:14:41,470
TALIESIN: He has disadvantage on all of his
physical attacks for the next round.

1151
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:42,666
MATT: Okay, cool.

1152
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:45,231
TALIESIN: One more shot for fun and let's make
this a sharpshooter.

1153
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,457
MATT: Sure.

1154
01:14:46,457 --> 01:14:54,809
TALIESIN: That was not my wisest thing ever. 16.

1155
01:14:54,809 --> 01:14:58,010
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately.

1156
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,460
TALIESIN: Oh well.

1157
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,434
LIAM: I don't think Vax has ever had one of
Percival's bullets go right by his ear.

1158
01:15:02,434 --> 01:15:04,051
It is unsettling.

1159
01:15:04,051 --> 01:15:12,704
TALIESIN: I'm going to flip back around on the
other side of that. I'm going to spider crawl all

1160
01:15:12,704 --> 01:15:14,803
the way on the other side of that door again.

1161
01:15:14,803 --> 01:15:22,811
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. At the end
of Percival's turn, there is a grinding sound

1162
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:25,122
above. Grog, I need you to make another dexterity
saving throw.

1163
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:33,785
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil. 18.

1164
01:15:33,785 --> 01:15:37,481
LAURA: No!

1165
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:40,366
SAM: Is it big enough to cover his big body?

1166
01:15:40,366 --> 01:15:44,007
TRAVIS: It's just like a spiked helmet stabbing me
in the cheek.

1167
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:50,103
MATT: It gets around your upper torso and sticks
partway on, and your arms are (click) to the side.

1168
01:15:50,103 --> 01:16:03,161
It tears into you. You take 14 points of piercing
damage reduced to seven, and then six points of

1169
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:07,300
fire damage reduced to three. You are restrained.

1170
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:13,756
TRAVIS: This one has spikes on the inside too?

1171
01:16:13,756 --> 01:16:14,710
MATT: Yep.

1172
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:15,572
TRAVIS: And it's hot?

1173
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:18,884
MATT: And it's hot. (sizzles) as the piercing and
the fire damage hits you. You are restrained.

1174
01:16:18,884 --> 01:16:22,663
TRAVIS: (warbled scream) Is that how you sound,
Tary?

1175
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:24,700
SAM: Always.

1176
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:36,732
MATT: The bone devil's going to fly across and
it's actually going to fly over Vax and land on

1177
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:37,996
the opposite side.

1178
01:16:37,996 --> 01:16:39,878
LIAM: Did it go past me? Can I get an attack of
opportunity?

1179
01:16:39,878 --> 01:16:44,058
MATT: Nope, it flies up high enough to be out of
your range and then drops down, both claws arcing

1180
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:50,634
towards you with disadvantage. First one's going
to be 22.

1181
01:16:50,634 --> 01:16:52,106
LIAM: Nope.

1182
01:16:52,106 --> 01:16:58,455
MATT: Nice. 18.

1183
01:16:58,455 --> 01:16:59,464
LIAM: Nope.

1184
01:16:59,464 --> 01:17:00,600
LAURA: What's your AC?

1185
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,852
LIAM: Hasted, with both daggers out? It's 23.

1186
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:09,805
MATT: With the tail, it is 19. All three miss.

1187
01:17:09,805 --> 01:17:13,752
SAM: Why does he have disadvantage?

1188
01:17:13,752 --> 01:17:15,887
TALIESIN: I shot him in the face.

1189
01:17:15,887 --> 01:17:21,527
MATT: Yeah, one of the eyes got blasted on the
side. Part of the skull is broken and destroyed.

1190
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:25,928
TALIESIN: That happens when I breathe for a second
before I shoot.

1191
01:17:25,928 --> 01:17:27,990
MATT: At this point in time--

1192
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,060
LAURA: Oh no, he's pulling things out!

1193
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,328
LIAM: More miniatures.

1194
01:17:33,328 --> 01:17:39,255
MATT: Two more devil characters come through. The
portcullis rises as they pass through, and they go

1195
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:47,939
into a full run into this chamber. You see these
red-skinned devil humanoids rush in with these

1196
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:53,124
long jagged spears. Horned crests on their head,
and from where their chins are, there are these

1197
01:17:53,124 --> 01:17:57,833
writhing tentacles covered in thorns and barbs
that move and twist around.

1198
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:03,907
TRAVIS: What sweet hell did your imagination come
from?

1199
01:18:03,907 --> 01:18:09,373
MATT: Full movement, with the double dash, that
guy will get there, this guy will get about there.

1200
01:18:09,373 --> 01:18:16,639
That's as far as they can get. Not fully up to
anybody yet. All right, we have Utugash. Stands up

1201
01:18:16,639 --> 01:18:20,056
in the flames and looks down at Taryon
Darrington.

1202
01:18:20,056 --> 01:18:25,867
SAM: Good day to you, sir. Do you know my father?

1203
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:34,889
MATT: You hear the voice echo in the center of
your mind, "Good day, and good night!" It's going

1204
01:18:34,889 --> 01:18:37,213
to make a full round of attacks on you.

1205
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,404
SAM: Oh boy.

1206
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:41,099
MATT: So that is 30 to hit.

1207
01:18:41,099 --> 01:18:46,594
SAM: Yeah, of course. Doty will save-- Nope.

1208
01:18:46,594 --> 01:18:53,290
MATT: As he leans forward and takes a big chunk
with his bite out of the front of your-- tries to

1209
01:18:53,290 --> 01:19:04,017
get to the helmet and the jaw sticks under the
chin. That's going to be 24 points of piercing damage.

1210
01:19:04,017 --> 01:19:07,615
However, you are immune to poison so you don't
have to worry about his poison right now thanks to

1211
01:19:07,615 --> 01:19:13,333
your-- So, the helmet catches most of the brunt of
it, and one of the teeth jabs you right underneath

1212
01:19:13,402 --> 01:19:18,277
the jaw and you can feel it pierce and begin to
bleed from underneath. As soon as he pulls back

1213
01:19:18,346 --> 01:19:22,319
and shoves you aside and releases its grip, as its
claw strikes out from its left arm.

1214
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,009
That is a 16 to hit.

1215
01:19:26,009 --> 01:19:29,350
SAM: Because I'm hasted, that does not hit.

1216
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:34,133
MATT: It rolled a two to hit. You just manage to
duck out of the way.

1217
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:36,011
SAM: Haha!

1218
01:19:36,011 --> 01:19:41,855
MATT: As you say, 'Haha!' the axe comes from the
other side-- That is a 22 to hit.

1219
01:19:41,855 --> 01:19:45,414
SAM: I have ve-- Ah! Yeah, that hits.

1220
01:19:45,414 --> 01:20:02,011
MATT: Double nines. That is 28 points of slashing
damage. The flames that currently engulf the axe--

1221
01:20:02,011 --> 01:20:12,236
The axe has burst into flames. He swings with it,
deals an additional 16 points of fire damage.

1222
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:13,932
SAM: Halved.

1223
01:20:13,932 --> 01:20:17,118
TRAVIS: How many ds of what did you roll?

1224
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:18,066
MATT: 6d6.

1225
01:20:18,066 --> 01:20:19,526
ALL: Ooh! No!

1226
01:20:19,526 --> 01:20:24,563
MATT: And using the momentum of the axe, the
entire body of the pit fiend spins around the

1227
01:20:24,563 --> 01:20:31,038
tail, whipping towards you. That is 20 to hit.

1228
01:20:31,038 --> 01:20:38,082
SAM: Me? But I'm just a man! Yeah, of course that
hits.

1229
01:20:38,082 --> 01:20:45,042
MATT: As the tail swings past, that is 28 points
of bludgeoning damage.

1230
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:49,477
LAURA: Are you alive, Tary?

1231
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:55,412
SAM: I'm okay because Marisha reminded me that
when I was not here one week, she gave me an extra

1232
01:20:55,412 --> 01:20:59,171
17 hit points, which I still have.

1233
01:20:59,171 --> 01:21:00,620
MATT: The Inspiring Leader feat.

1234
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:02,995
SAM: They're helping me a lot right now.

1235
01:21:02,995 --> 01:21:17,364
MATT: Utugash stays there in the center of the
flames, just waiting for people to come to him.

1236
01:21:17,364 --> 01:21:19,418
TRAVIS: He still looks nonplussed? Just chill?

1237
01:21:19,418 --> 01:21:24,910
MATT: You don't know, you can't see through the
fire. That brings us to the top. Vax, you're up.

1238
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:29,542
LIAM: All right, I'm going to shoot out my fucking
wings and I'm going to Hunter's Mark the asshole,

1239
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:31,768
and then I'm going to skip--

1240
01:21:31,768 --> 01:21:33,126
MATT: The guy you're fighting?

1241
01:21:33,126 --> 01:21:40,347
LIAM: Yeah. I'm going to skip Disengage and fly
backward towards the end of the hall

1242
01:21:40,405 --> 01:21:41,622
he came out of.

1243
01:21:41,622 --> 01:21:42,361
SAM: Matt?

1244
01:21:42,361 --> 01:21:43,186
MATT: Yeah?

1245
01:21:43,186 --> 01:21:47,926
SAM: On the first of those attacks, I have
Sanctuary.

1246
01:21:47,926 --> 01:21:50,337
MARISHA: You do.

1247
01:21:50,337 --> 01:21:53,636
SAM: It's just one wisdom roll.

1248
01:21:53,636 --> 01:21:57,898
MATT: Natural 20, plus ten, 30.

1249
01:21:57,898 --> 01:22:06,190
SAM: I think it's safe to say, even in
retrospect.

1250
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:16,541
MATT: Yeah, sorry. Time progressed as it was meant
to. But good call! So, Vax.

1251
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:23,166
LIAM: It was wings, Hunter's Mark, chancing a hit
as I fly down the hall away from him.

1252
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:24,444
MATT: This way?

1253
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,063
LIAM: Yeah, that's good.

1254
01:22:26,063 --> 01:22:34,337
MATT: It attacks with the tail. Still has
disadvantage. 20.

1255
01:22:34,337 --> 01:22:35,514
LIAM: Nope.

1256
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:37,801
MATT: Just arcs and misses you as you zoom out.

1257
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:46,867
LIAM: I'm going to chuck Whisper using a
sharpshooter, but at advantage. 26.

1258
01:22:46,867 --> 01:22:47,984
MATT: That hits.

1259
01:22:47,984 --> 01:23:11,766
LIAM: All right. 11, 21 plus psychic damage,
sorry, doing math, be right with you. 58.

1260
01:23:11,766 --> 01:23:24,784
MATT: 58, nice! That was towards the bone devil?

1261
01:23:24,784 --> 01:23:27,760
LIAM: Throwing the dagger? Yeah.

1262
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:33,337
MATT: Right. That was with the Sneak Attack
damage, because--

1263
01:23:33,337 --> 01:23:35,859
LIAM: Because I'm at advantage because of Vow of
Enmity.

1264
01:23:35,859 --> 01:23:37,334
MATT: Vow of Enmity was on the pit fiend.

1265
01:23:37,334 --> 01:23:39,429
LIAM: No, it was on the bone devil.

1266
01:23:39,429 --> 01:23:41,238
MATT: You're right, it was. You're correct.

1267
01:23:41,238 --> 01:23:45,349
LIAM: Also Hunter's Mark. So let's up that by
one.

1268
01:23:45,349 --> 01:23:55,699
MATT: All righty. Cool. That's your single
attack?

1269
01:23:55,699 --> 01:24:04,396
LIAM: I used everything. Wings, Hunter's Mark, and
the dagger. Bonus, action, action.

1270
01:24:04,396 --> 01:24:07,250
MATT: That ends your turn. Vex.

1271
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:16,363
LAURA: If I pop through the window, will I be able
to get out of the window? I want to pop through

1272
01:24:16,363 --> 01:24:20,426
the window, get Trinket in the locket; that's what
I'm going to do first.

1273
01:24:20,426 --> 01:24:22,966
MATT: You come through, step through--

1274
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:25,919
LAURA: Go, Buddy!

1275
01:24:25,919 --> 01:24:32,654
MATT: As you do, Trinket zooms into the locket,
leaving the cage to clank to the ground.

1276
01:24:32,654 --> 01:24:37,333
LAURA: I'm going to hop back through the window.

1277
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:41,140
MATT: Okay. That's your turn.

1278
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,475
LAURA: Can I let him back out of the locket from
there, or--

1279
01:24:43,475 --> 01:24:45,540
MATT: Next turn, you can.

1280
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,082
LAURA: That's my whole fucking turn?

1281
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:49,911
MATT: Yup! Tary.

1282
01:24:49,911 --> 01:24:52,578
SAM: What happened? Oh, it's my turn?

1283
01:24:52,578 --> 01:24:53,442
MATT: Yes.

1284
01:24:53,442 --> 01:24:54,772
SAM: Oh, great!

1285
01:24:54,772 --> 01:24:57,815
MATT: You guys would all be taking Fear Aura
checks, but you're immune to fear because of your

1286
01:24:57,815 --> 01:25:00,578
Heroes' Feast. Just letting you know.

1287
01:25:00,578 --> 01:25:02,805
TRAVIS: Fear Aura checks? Oh my god.

1288
01:25:02,805 --> 01:25:11,062
SAM: You know how sometimes when we're in fights
and bad guys can walk around us without incurring

1289
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:13,425
damage?

1290
01:25:13,425 --> 01:25:19,071
MATT: You only get attacks of opportunity if you
move away. If you stay within range, it doesn't--

1291
01:25:19,071 --> 01:25:22,140
SAM: I'm going to clock around him, clockwise.

1292
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:26,630
MATT: Until--

1293
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:31,612
SAM: Yeah, right there's pretty good. Do I see
any-- I can't see out of the ring, right?

1294
01:25:31,612 --> 01:25:34,028
MATT: You are stepping into the flames to do
this.

1295
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:35,853
SAM: Ew, what?

1296
01:25:35,853 --> 01:25:42,363
MATT: You can get right here on the edge and not
be quite in the fire.

1297
01:25:42,363 --> 01:25:50,560
SAM: I'll do that. I'll say, it's been lovely
having this time with you in private, but our

1298
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:57,692
seven minutes in heaven are up. I need you to
leave. I will do the Ring of the Ram at full

1299
01:25:57,692 --> 01:26:12,237
strength and push him out of his own ring. If it
works. That's a one. But I'm feeling Lucky.

1300
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:23,750
That's a three. Can I feel really Lucky?

1301
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:30,873
MATT: Unfortunately, it does not work that way,
Taryon. I am so sorry.

1302
01:26:30,873 --> 01:26:33,375
SAM: No, that's fine. Does it fire?

1303
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:39,381
MATT: It does fire, and I believe it's just a
miss. It's a hit-or-miss-type circumstance.

1304
01:26:39,381 --> 01:26:41,923
SAM: It just misses. I've lost it all there.

1305
01:26:41,923 --> 01:26:48,620
MATT: The ram head goes careening out of the wall
of fire, slamming into the stone work and causing

1306
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:57,802
a big crack in the stone in the wall. The pit
fiend says, "I will eat your face first."

1307
01:26:57,851 --> 01:27:03,211
SAM: Oh Jesus, I like my face.

1308
01:27:03,211 --> 01:27:06,326
MATT: You're still hasted.

1309
01:27:06,326 --> 01:27:12,301
SAM: Still hasted. For my second thing, I can only
do a melee attack. I can't cast anything, I can't

1310
01:27:12,301 --> 01:27:14,731
reach into my satchel or anything.

1311
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:21,373
MATT: The bonus action you have from Haste is for
weapon attack only. Or you can try and run away.

1312
01:27:21,554 --> 01:27:22,927
SAM: Yeah, I could.

1313
01:27:22,927 --> 01:27:25,331
MATT: So he'll get an attack of opportunity on
you.

1314
01:27:25,331 --> 01:27:27,703
TRAVIS: What would Doty do?

1315
01:27:27,703 --> 01:27:29,437
SAM: That's fair.

1316
01:27:29,437 --> 01:27:32,897
LAURA: Fall over and be unconscious, is what Doty
would do.

1317
01:27:32,897 --> 01:27:43,000
SAM: I will spend the rest of my turn moving back
to where Doty was, picking up his book, putting it

1318
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:52,326
in my Bag of Holding so it doesn't burn up. Then
crawl into a ball and cast Sanctuary on myself.

1319
01:27:52,326 --> 01:27:56,509
(laughter)

1320
01:27:56,509 --> 01:28:01,512
MATT: That ends Taryon's turn.

1321
01:28:01,512 --> 01:28:06,686
SAM: If I don't look, he'll go away!

1322
01:28:06,686 --> 01:28:12,606
MATT: That brings us to Keyleth's turn.

1323
01:28:12,606 --> 01:28:17,271
MARISHA: Where are the little pissant guys?

1324
01:28:17,271 --> 01:28:26,506
MATT: There's one there right next to Grog, and
one right next to Doty. So there, and there.

1325
01:28:26,506 --> 01:28:34,689
MARISHA: I'm going to hop through the window
again. I'm going to cast Sunbeam.

1326
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:40,332
MATT: Are you gonna move in to try and get them both in
the same path?

1327
01:28:40,406 --> 01:28:41,632
MARISHA: Yeah.

1328
01:28:41,632 --> 01:28:44,253
MATT: Sunbeam it is.

1329
01:28:44,253 --> 01:28:46,864
LAURA: Matt, can I use my bonus action to at least
Hide?

1330
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:52,551
MATT: Sure, roll a stealth check. So it's a
constitution saving throw for

1331
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:54,689
both of the bearded devils.

1332
01:28:54,689 --> 01:28:56,473
LAURA: 23.

1333
01:28:56,473 --> 01:29:00,153
MATT: Okay, good to know. That is a ten--

1334
01:29:00,153 --> 01:29:01,504
MARISHA: Negative.

1335
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:02,702
MATT: -- and an 18.

1336
01:29:02,702 --> 01:29:04,625
MARISHA: Negative again.

1337
01:29:04,625 --> 01:29:07,044
MATT: So, 6d8 radiant damage to both and they are
both blinded.

1338
01:29:07,044 --> 01:29:16,006
MARISHA: 6d8? Can I have two more d8s, please?
Those were definitely d6s.

1339
01:29:16,006 --> 01:29:18,090
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, here's a d8.

1340
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:36,502
MARISHA: Thank you. Oh that's good. 30 points of
radiant damage.

1341
01:29:36,502 --> 01:29:48,345
MATT: To both of them. Nice. As the beam (pssh)
across the room it streaks down the way and both

1342
01:29:48,345 --> 01:29:53,765
of them get engulfed. As the beam of bright
sunlight energy slowly diminishes, their faces are

1343
01:29:53,765 --> 01:29:59,626
seared. You see smoke pouring out of their eyes as
they're both reaching up to the sockets. That was

1344
01:29:59,626 --> 01:30:01,823
not so good for them. They're both looking pretty
rough already.

1345
01:30:01,823 --> 01:30:05,197
MARISHA: I look at Tary. Tary is within 30 feet of
me, yeah?

1346
01:30:05,271 --> 01:30:07,211
MATT: You don't see Tary. You just see a column of
fire.

1347
01:30:07,211 --> 01:30:08,313
MARISHA: I don't see Tary.

1348
01:30:08,313 --> 01:30:12,326
MATT: Tary is currently inside the wall of fire,
curled in a ball. All you see is a giant column of

1349
01:30:12,326 --> 01:30:16,633
flame in the center of the room. And half of Doty
being slowly heated up.

1350
01:30:16,633 --> 01:30:20,689
MARISHA: Do I see anyone else, and does anyone
else look rough?

1351
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:26,005
MATT: You see Grog with a giant cage on his upper
body, wrapping around his torso.

1352
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:29,883
TRAVIS: Just spinning in place (confused
screams).

1353
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:31,575
(laughter)

1354
01:30:31,575 --> 01:30:33,346
NOELLE: I'm down to 39 hit points.

1355
01:30:33,346 --> 01:30:34,404
MARISHA: Do I see Tova?

1356
01:30:34,404 --> 01:30:35,386
MATT: You do see Tova, yeah.

1357
01:30:35,386 --> 01:30:42,697
MARISHA: Okay, I say, hey, sorry about the whole
Tsunami thing. You got this! And I give her a

1358
01:30:42,697 --> 01:30:53,240
Healing Word at level one. I'm going to give you--
shit-- plus my spell modifier.

1359
01:30:53,429 --> 01:30:57,732
Sorry, nine hit points.

1360
01:30:57,732 --> 01:30:58,821
LIAM: Fixed.

1361
01:30:58,821 --> 01:31:00,420
NOELLE: All better now.

1362
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:04,448
MATT: Hey, it helps. It all helps. Trust me, it
helps. All right, Keyleth, are you going to stay

1363
01:31:04,448 --> 01:31:05,567
where you are?

1364
01:31:05,567 --> 01:31:06,448
MARISHA: Yeah.

1365
01:31:06,448 --> 01:31:09,340
MATT: All right, Keyleth stays there. Tova and
Grog, you're up.

1366
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:13,698
NOELLE: So two questions and one of them is, is my
Rite still on?

1367
01:31:13,698 --> 01:31:16,831
MATT: Yes it is. Your Rite stays on
until you dismiss it.

1368
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:21,912
NOELLE: All right, my question also is are these
cages still-- would it hurt me to

1369
01:31:21,912 --> 01:31:23,503
touch one or move one?

1370
01:31:23,503 --> 01:31:25,625
MATT: I mean, they're pretty warm to touch.

1371
01:31:25,625 --> 01:31:27,531
NOELLE: My hands are very cool.

1372
01:31:27,531 --> 01:31:30,752
MATT: You know what? Actually, with your claws
out, I would say they will do no damage to you

1373
01:31:30,752 --> 01:31:32,409
because the cold will offset that.

1374
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:39,695
NOELLE: All right, so let me know if this sounds
doable. I want to grab that cage that

1375
01:31:39,695 --> 01:31:41,124
Trinket was under.

1376
01:31:41,124 --> 01:31:42,234
MATT: Okay.

1377
01:31:42,234 --> 01:31:48,534
NOELLE: And move it towards where Utugash is. Tary
is in the fire, yeah?

1378
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:49,632
MATT: Yes.

1379
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:52,901
NOELLE: Can I grab him and pull him back with me,
behind this cage?

1380
01:31:52,901 --> 01:31:59,546
MATT: He's about 25 feet from you. You don't even
know where he is. You know that he's inside the

1381
01:31:59,546 --> 01:32:02,507
fire, but you don't see him. Because you're
outside the flames, all you see is a wall of fire.

1382
01:32:02,507 --> 01:32:08,525
You have to step into the fire, take the fire
damage, grab him and pull him back.

1383
01:32:08,525 --> 01:32:16,325
NOELLE: Can I just reach (laughs) my cold bear
hand into the fire and grab him and pull him out?

1384
01:32:16,325 --> 01:32:18,767
MATT: You'll still take the fire damage from the
wall of fire, unfortunately.

1385
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:22,201
NOELLE: Can I get decreased fire damage?

1386
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:27,551
MATT: It's probably not going to work out. It's
magical fire, I'm sorry. But the cage is nearby.

1387
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:31,509
You are closer to the cage than you are him. So if
you want to grab the cage and move towards him you

1388
01:32:31,509 --> 01:32:36,021
can do that. Is that what you want to do?

1389
01:32:36,021 --> 01:32:50,126
NOELLE: Let me-- can I grab this cage and put it
between-- this cage is just sitting out, got to do

1390
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:57,761
something. Can I throw the cage at that guy who's
standing there? He's there, right?

1391
01:32:57,761 --> 01:33:02,392
MATT: You can. Go ahead and make a strength check.
You have advantage because

1392
01:33:02,392 --> 01:33:04,448
you are in your bear form.

1393
01:33:04,448 --> 01:33:08,058
NOELLE: (laughs) That is a 14.

1394
01:33:08,058 --> 01:33:10,429
MATT: 14 is fine, that's enough.

1395
01:33:10,429 --> 01:33:12,238
NOELLE: No, wait. 13. What?

1396
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:13,599
LAURA: Didn't you roll an eight?

1397
01:33:13,599 --> 01:33:15,607
LIAM: Plus your strength of ten. So 18.

1398
01:33:15,607 --> 01:33:18,436
NOELLE: Oh yeah. Bears are great at math.

1399
01:33:18,436 --> 01:33:22,557
MATT: Sorry, this would be an athletics check to
lift it, not strength, sorry.

1400
01:33:22,557 --> 01:33:23,838
NOELLE: Okay, then yeah. 18.

1401
01:33:23,838 --> 01:33:28,407
MATT: So you reach over and you grab it and the
steam rises up the sides of the cage, and you lift

1402
01:33:28,414 --> 01:33:31,836
it up over your head, and you're going to go and
try to throw it over at this guy there? So as you

1403
01:33:31,836 --> 01:33:38,820
lift the cage, go ahead and roll for just accuracy
on this. Roll an attack, add your proficiency.

1404
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:47,485
What did you roll? Oh no. You throw the cage and
it rolls into the center of the hallway there,

1405
01:33:47,485 --> 01:33:50,965
blocking the doorway. Ah, those ones are the
worst.

1406
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:52,023
NOELLE: I know.

1407
01:33:52,023 --> 01:33:53,493
TRAVIS: (laughs) That dice sucks.

1408
01:33:53,493 --> 01:33:54,335
NOELLE: I know, yeah.

1409
01:33:54,335 --> 01:33:55,643
LAURA: You seriously need to stop using that one.

1410
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:57,710
NOELLE: What else can I do?

1411
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:00,413
MATT: You still have your movement and your bonus
if you wanted to do--

1412
01:34:00,413 --> 01:34:03,062
SAM: Do you have healing potions?

1413
01:34:03,062 --> 01:34:05,847
MATT: You still have your Blood Maladict if you
wanted to use any of it.

1414
01:34:05,847 --> 01:34:11,059
NOELLE: All my stuff is probably in that prison
that Percy was in. I don't have any pockets.

1415
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:12,851
(laughter)

1416
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:14,382
SAM: Oh yeah.

1417
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:20,050
NOELLE: Yeah, I was sort of unprepared for this. I
was really excited for this fight.

1418
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:24,056
MARISHA: Tiny pockets, this is a problem of
women's fashion, to be fair.

1419
01:34:24,056 --> 01:34:25,466
NOELLE: I know, even with the bears.

1420
01:34:25,466 --> 01:34:27,656
MARISHA: Why tiny pockets?

1421
01:34:27,656 --> 01:34:28,827
NOELLE: I know.

1422
01:34:28,827 --> 01:34:30,618
MARISHA: Come on women's fashion, come on.

1423
01:34:30,618 --> 01:34:33,559
NOELLE: So I have my bonus action?

1424
01:34:33,559 --> 01:34:34,866
MATT: You do.

1425
01:34:35,047 --> 01:34:42,290
LAURA: What is a Blood Maladict?

1426
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:44,630
LIAM: Really cool words on the sheet.

1427
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:51,501
NOELLE: I know. Not as helpful as I had hoped. I
can see an object's history--

1428
01:34:51,501 --> 01:34:53,759
MATT: Grog, what are you doing? While she is
figuring this out.

1429
01:34:53,759 --> 01:34:55,432
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and get out of the cage.

1430
01:34:55,432 --> 01:34:58,696
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength
skill check.

1431
01:34:58,696 --> 01:35:00,060
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those.

1432
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,426
MATT: Yes, you do.

1433
01:35:01,426 --> 01:35:04,691
LAURA: (Grog voice) I have advantage. Ooh, that's
good.

1434
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:06,592
TRAVIS and LAURA: That's better.

1435
01:35:06,592 --> 01:35:08,056
TRAVIS: 27.

1436
01:35:08,056 --> 01:35:15,000
MATT: 27. As you tense, the metal actually
(creaks) and bends out the sides and you just tear

1437
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,670
the cage off of the top of you. That's your
action.

1438
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,721
LAURA: That's your whole action?

1439
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:21,524
TRAVIS: Yep.

1440
01:35:21,524 --> 01:35:22,447
MATT: Yep.

1441
01:35:22,447 --> 01:35:24,526
TRAVIS: Yep.

1442
01:35:24,526 --> 01:35:26,278
TALIESIN: You've got bonuses and stuff, though.

1443
01:35:26,278 --> 01:35:27,874
MATT: You do. You have your bonus action if you're
still raging, so.

1444
01:35:27,874 --> 01:35:30,022
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do!

1445
01:35:30,022 --> 01:35:32,781
LIAM: Waking up!

1446
01:35:32,781 --> 01:35:36,411
TRAVIS: I'm going to throw-- Oh, I just see a
column of fire.

1447
01:35:36,589 --> 01:35:37,661
MATT: You just see a column of fire.

1448
01:35:37,661 --> 01:35:39,247
TRAVIS: But I see a motherfucker behind me, don't
I?

1449
01:35:39,247 --> 01:35:40,104
MATT: You do, yeah.

1450
01:35:40,104 --> 01:35:43,877
TRAVIS: He going to turn to jelly. Do I have my
movement?

1451
01:35:43,877 --> 01:35:45,141
MATT: You do.

1452
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:47,037
TRAVIS: I would like to visit him, please.

1453
01:35:47,037 --> 01:35:50,817
MATT: You turn around, and he's right there.
Currently with his eyes smoking from being seared

1454
01:35:50,817 --> 01:35:52,287
with a Sunbeam.

1455
01:35:52,287 --> 01:35:54,087
TRAVIS: Hi! Smash.

1456
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:55,921
MATT: Okay, he's blinded, so you have advantage
automatically.

1457
01:35:55,921 --> 01:36:00,270
TRAVIS: Yay! Natural 20.

1458
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,880
LAURA: Oh! Can you imagine if you had been
attacking the pit fiend?

1459
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,107
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know!

1460
01:36:04,107 --> 01:36:08,122
TALIESIN: Smear him.

1461
01:36:08,122 --> 01:36:12,287
TRAVIS: That's 24-- That's two additional damage
die.

1462
01:36:12,287 --> 01:36:14,377
TALEISIN: Like a fat mosquito.

1463
01:36:14,377 --> 01:36:18,499
TRAVIS: 30.

1464
01:36:18,499 --> 01:36:19,984
MATT: 30 points of damage?

1465
01:36:19,984 --> 01:36:24,562
TRAVIS: Yeah. They were all three really
low-damage die rolls. Oh! Actually, I can reroll a

1466
01:36:24,562 --> 01:36:27,554
one or a two, which was that last one! Nine,
that's better.

1467
01:36:27,554 --> 01:36:29,230
SAM: Doesn't matter, you killed him.

1468
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:31,017
MARISHA: Doesn't matter, he's dead. He's so dead.

1469
01:36:31,017 --> 01:36:35,398
MATT: As you turn around and see him there, you
go, "Hi," wham. He's going (hisses) and hears this

1470
01:36:35,398 --> 01:36:42,094
"Hi" and his entire head collapses inward and you
shove it down to about the height of the rest of

1471
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:46,524
his shoulders. He just (wet collapsing noises) to
the ground, and just crumples. And then burns into

1472
01:36:46,524 --> 01:36:49,871
ash and just cinders left behind. Destroyed.

1473
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:51,954
TRAVIS: Cool, huh?

1474
01:36:51,954 --> 01:36:57,895
MATT: That's beautiful, is what it is. Ending
Grog's turn, Percival, you're up.

1475
01:36:57,895 --> 01:36:59,619
NOELLE: Wait, can I take my last thing?

1476
01:36:59,619 --> 01:37:01,215
MATT: Oh, yeah, that's right! What're you going to
do with your bonus?

1477
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:03,818
NOELLE: All right, so I can only move or I can
only use my bonus action, yeah?

1478
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:04,877
MATT: Correct, yeah.

1479
01:37:04,877 --> 01:37:09,403
NOELLE: Okay, well, I'm just going to cast Curse
of Mutual Suffering on Utugash one more time.

1480
01:37:09,403 --> 01:37:16,584
MATT: You currently do not have visual range on
him, you can't see him. Does it say, for the

1481
01:37:16,584 --> 01:37:24,354
curse, that you need to be able to see the
creature? That's the question, let me look.

1482
01:37:24,354 --> 01:37:27,054
NOELLE: It just says, "a creature within 30
feet."

1483
01:37:27,054 --> 01:37:32,891
MATT: So, yeah. So you just know where they are.
So you can! Curse of Mutual Suffering does hit

1484
01:37:32,891 --> 01:37:34,676
Utugash, are you going to amplify it, or not?

1485
01:37:34,676 --> 01:37:36,107
NOELLE: Am I going to what?

1486
01:37:36,107 --> 01:37:37,258
MATT: Amplify it, or leave it as it is?

1487
01:37:37,258 --> 01:37:38,988
NOELLE: Yeah, I'm going to amplify it.

1488
01:37:38,988 --> 01:37:40,565
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d8 and take d8
damage.

1489
01:37:40,565 --> 01:37:45,064
NOELLE: All right, I'm just going to-- Oh! Six.
That is six for me.

1490
01:37:45,064 --> 01:37:45,945
MATT: All righty.

1491
01:37:45,945 --> 01:37:49,722
NOELLE: And then I'm going to throw my bear arms
wide and just like--

1492
01:37:49,722 --> 01:37:51,958
MATT: (laughs) Come at me, bro?

1493
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:53,729
(laughter)

1494
01:37:53,729 --> 01:37:55,362
NOELLE: 'Sup, asshole?

1495
01:37:55,362 --> 01:37:59,554
MATT: Perfect. All righty.

1496
01:37:59,554 --> 01:38:01,628
Percival, you're up.

1497
01:38:01,628 --> 01:38:05,907
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to reload. Because
boy, I'm out.

1498
01:38:05,907 --> 01:38:08,160
LAURA and TRAVIS: Bubble throat!

1499
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:15,903
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's right! I was, like,
what? What? Bubble-- Yeah. (gravelly mumbling) Got

1500
01:38:15,903 --> 01:38:19,580
a little thing. I didn't know it had a name, and
now it's the obvious name for it. It's bubble

1501
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:25,818
throat. I'm going to swing back around and back up
a little bit, and I'm going to take three more

1502
01:38:25,818 --> 01:38:29,983
potshots at that bone, because that's what I can
see.

1503
01:38:29,983 --> 01:38:31,393
MATT: All righty.

1504
01:38:31,393 --> 01:38:36,070
TALIESIN: I'm not going to get close to him. I'm
going to back up a bit. Just back up in the middle

1505
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:38,916
of the room. I'm going to keep going.

1506
01:38:38,916 --> 01:38:42,119
MATT: About there? Sure. Go for it and take your
attacks.

1507
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:55,615
TALIESIN: Nothing fancy, attack number one: that's
26 to hit. And that's nine points of piercing

1508
01:38:55,615 --> 01:39:01,262
damage, five points of necrotic damage, and two
points of psychic damage.

1509
01:39:01,262 --> 01:39:07,283
MATT: Vax, as you're looking across the room, you
see the bone devil (hisses), and it rears back,

1510
01:39:07,283 --> 01:39:11,437
and the wings span out, it looks like he's
about to leap. And as it takes its jump, you watch

1511
01:39:11,506 --> 01:39:17,639
its face explode forward with dark crimson, just,
mist, as the head is blown off of its shoulders.

1512
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:22,659
MARISHA: Get that Grit back.

1513
01:39:22,888 --> 01:39:30,771
TALIESIN: Better! And I'm going to see if I can--
Is there anything? I've got two more shots.

1514
01:39:30,771 --> 01:39:36,838
MATT: There is one creature in here that you can
barely see through the side.

1515
01:39:36,838 --> 01:39:43,208
TALIESIN: Oh, I can? Oh, all right, let's do that,
that's funny. Another shot at that guy.

1516
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:47,034
LAURA: It is really hard to see some of these
people.

1517
01:39:47,034 --> 01:39:49,361
TALIESIN: 23?

1518
01:39:49,361 --> 01:39:51,320
MATT: Red creatures on dark red. Sorry.

1519
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,406
TALIESIN: 23?

1520
01:39:52,406 --> 01:39:53,630
MATT: 23 hits.

1521
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:58,425
TALIESIN: Oh, and that's right, I don't have that
anymore, the Hex isn't until next turn where I can

1522
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:05,208
move it. That's 15 points of damage plus one point
of psychic damage?

1523
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:10,673
MATT: Okay. Still standing, but it's looking
rough. You have advantage on these attacks, by the

1524
01:40:10,673 --> 01:40:11,852
way, because it's blinded.

1525
01:40:11,852 --> 01:40:15,427
TALIESIN: Oh! All right. And then I'm going to
take another shot. I'm going to make this a

1526
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:22,667
sharpshooter, just to end this. Yeah, that'll do.
That's 14, 20. 25?

1527
01:40:22,667 --> 01:40:24,746
MATT: Yep. Go ahead and roll damage.

1528
01:40:24,746 --> 01:40:33,452
TALIESIN: I didn't know I had advantage, that's
lovely. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 25 points of damage

1529
01:40:33,452 --> 01:40:35,081
and four points of psychic damage.

1530
01:40:35,081 --> 01:40:38,497
MATT: So, after the cage goes flying over his head
and clangs behind it, it spins around as it hears

1531
01:40:38,569 --> 01:40:43,438
the impact, and turns back in the direction of
Tova. Even though its eyes are currently held shut

1532
01:40:43,438 --> 01:40:50,605
from the blinding light of the Sunbeam, it rears
back with its hooked pull arm and is about to rush

1533
01:40:50,605 --> 01:40:55,185
towards the torso of Tova, knowing and being able
to sense where she is. Right as it rears back

1534
01:40:55,185 --> 01:41:02,307
(gunshots), two shots, the second one knocking its
head limply across the back of its shoulders, and

1535
01:41:02,307 --> 01:41:04,467
it tumbles to the ground, unmoving.

1536
01:41:04,467 --> 01:41:06,628
MARISHA: You get another Grit back!

1537
01:41:06,628 --> 01:41:07,946
TALIESIN: I get another Grit back.

1538
01:41:07,946 --> 01:41:09,638
TRAVIS: Get another Grit back.

1539
01:41:09,638 --> 01:41:11,951
MARISHA: Get that Grit back.

1540
01:41:11,951 --> 01:41:13,388
MATT: Is that the end of your turn, Percy?

1541
01:41:13,388 --> 01:41:17,890
TALIESIN: That is, other than just backing up a
little bit more, as far as I can go, just to get

1542
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:18,656
out of the--

1543
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:19,878
MATT: (laughs) Just getting away from everything!

1544
01:41:19,878 --> 01:41:21,296
TALIESIN: Getting away from everything!

1545
01:41:21,296 --> 01:41:22,800
MATT: "Ah! Ah!" Okay, perfect.

1546
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,218
TALIESIN: I'm good at a distance.

1547
01:41:25,296 --> 01:41:36,389
MATT: Okay, so. This is on Utugash's turn: Utugash
is going to strike with a bite against Taryon

1548
01:41:36,389 --> 01:41:37,648
Darrington.

1549
01:41:37,648 --> 01:41:38,767
SAM: Sure.

1550
01:41:38,767 --> 01:41:43,194
MATT: Frustratingly, that's going to be-- oh, it
has to make a wisdom save, doesn't it?

1551
01:41:43,194 --> 01:41:44,496
SAM: It does.

1552
01:41:44,496 --> 01:41:47,224
MATT: For that first attack, that's a natural 20.

1553
01:41:47,224 --> 01:41:48,598
LAURA: Oh my god!

1554
01:41:48,598 --> 01:41:55,545
MATT: Better that than for the attack! But after
that, the first attack was a 18 to hit?

1555
01:41:55,545 --> 01:41:56,623
SAM: Hits.

1556
01:41:56,623 --> 01:42:05,751
MATT: All righty. As it chomps down onto your
torso, this time, as opposed to going for the

1557
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:10,181
helmet, it goes for the side of the shoulder, its
mouth is large enough to go over your shoulder and

1558
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:17,037
come in both the chest and the back of the
shoulder as it sinks in. That is going to be 24

1559
01:42:17,037 --> 01:42:22,412
points of piercing damage. And you're immune to
poison, so you don't take that.

1560
01:42:22,412 --> 01:42:24,356
You're still standing?

1561
01:42:24,356 --> 01:42:25,170
SAM: Yes.

1562
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:25,974
MATT: All righty.

1563
01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:27,244
SAM: Well, crouching.

1564
01:42:27,244 --> 01:42:28,201
MATT: Right.

1565
01:42:28,201 --> 01:42:29,281
MARISHA: In the fetal position.

1566
01:42:29,281 --> 01:42:34,998
MATT: As it's clamped down on you, it takes its
claw and rakes across your stomach.

1567
01:42:34,998 --> 01:42:40,248
SAM: Technically, it has to roll another wisdom
save. It lasts for a minute,

1568
01:42:40,248 --> 01:42:41,773
it's not per attack, actually.

1569
01:42:41,773 --> 01:42:43,887
MATT: It does, you're right! That is a ten plus
ten, that is 20.

1570
01:42:43,887 --> 01:42:44,851
SAM: He succeeds.

1571
01:42:44,851 --> 01:42:49,205
MATT: Okay. The attack roll for that one was a
21.

1572
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:50,604
SAM: Yes.

1573
01:42:50,604 --> 01:42:59,851
MATT: So for the claw raking across your torso,
that is going to be 21 points of slashing damage.

1574
01:42:59,851 --> 01:43:01,291
SAM: (strangled death noises)

1575
01:43:01,291 --> 01:43:02,370
LAURA: Oh no, Tary!

1576
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:06,183
MATT: And with that, Taryon falls unconscious and
bleeding on the ground.

1577
01:43:06,183 --> 01:43:07,749
TRAVIS: Tary Jumbo!

1578
01:43:07,749 --> 01:43:14,880
MATT: Utugash, after the claws tear across part of
the plate armor swings open, and the claw rakes

1579
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:21,112
through the side of the torso, leaving the wounds
open and bleeding out and steaming across the

1580
01:43:21,112 --> 01:43:23,944
heavy heated stonework of the room.

1581
01:43:23,944 --> 01:43:27,357
SAM: And at that point, do all of their necklaces
glow?

1582
01:43:27,357 --> 01:43:30,724
MATT: They do. They begin to pulse.

1583
01:43:30,724 --> 01:43:33,568
MARISHA: That's totally correct, yeah.

1584
01:43:33,568 --> 01:43:34,949
NOELLE: What's going on?

1585
01:43:34,949 --> 01:43:36,724
TRAVIS: I've no idea what this means.

1586
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:41,358
MARISHA: Someone's unconscious and we can't tell
that they're unconscious.

1587
01:43:41,358 --> 01:43:49,269
MATT: At this point, Utugash is going to use his--
The wings take flight at this point, as nothing is

1588
01:43:49,269 --> 01:43:54,841
immediately in the circle, and he's getting
frustrated by this. The wings pick him up in the

1589
01:43:54,841 --> 01:44:01,658
air. He's going to peek through the top of the
form and look over, and he sees Tova and Keyleth,

1590
01:44:01,658 --> 01:44:08,389
and is going to land, technically on your guys'
spaces. This is part of his Corpulent Form

1591
01:44:08,389 --> 01:44:11,967
ability. I need you both to make dexterity saving
throws.

1592
01:44:11,967 --> 01:44:15,603
NOELLE: Finally, thank you. That is an 18.

1593
01:44:15,603 --> 01:44:22,022
MARISHA: That's not great. Saving, dex, 14.

1594
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:29,741
MATT: All right. You both suffer 17 points of
bludgeoning damage as Utugash's giant form lands

1595
01:44:29,741 --> 01:44:35,188
on top of you. You are pinned to the ground. You
are considered grappled and prone. As Utugash is

1596
01:44:35,188 --> 01:44:36,409
currently now--

1597
01:44:36,409 --> 01:44:39,280
NOELLE: So, Utugash also maybe takes some damage
from that.

1598
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,851
MATT: Yeah, well, takes the same 17 points of
damage from the Mutual Suffering.

1599
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:44,184
NOELLE: That's something.

1600
01:44:44,184 --> 01:44:50,091
MATT: So you're both prone and considered
grappled. You cannot move until you

1601
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:51,517
get out of the grapple.

1602
01:44:51,517 --> 01:44:52,983
MARISHA: We're both grappled?

1603
01:44:52,983 --> 01:44:54,952
MATT: Yeah, because he's basically sitting on top
of you.

1604
01:44:54,952 --> 01:44:56,721
MARISHA: Fucking dick.

1605
01:44:56,721 --> 01:45:01,873
MATT: I need you to make a concentration saving
throw to maintain Sunbeam.

1606
01:45:01,873 --> 01:45:03,323
MARISHA: I have advantage on that.

1607
01:45:03,323 --> 01:45:04,951
MATT: You do.

1608
01:45:04,951 --> 01:45:06,735
MARISHA: I'll take that 18.

1609
01:45:06,735 --> 01:45:07,861
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1610
01:45:07,861 --> 01:45:12,674
MARISHA: Yeah, I just have to beat the damage,
correct? 18.

1611
01:45:12,674 --> 01:45:20,487
MATT: It's either ten or half of the damage, so
you're fine. With you both pinned-- you, at

1612
01:45:20,487 --> 01:45:29,135
immediate visual perspective, look the most
vulnerable to Utugash, as you are a tiny half-elf

1613
01:45:29,135 --> 01:45:34,176
girl, as far as he's concerned. He's going to use
his next two attacks, the axe and the tail, with

1614
01:45:34,176 --> 01:45:36,693
advantage against you because you are currently
knocked prone.

1615
01:45:36,693 --> 01:45:38,086
MARISHA: Aw, desu desu.

1616
01:45:38,086 --> 01:45:42,313
MATT: The axe is going to be a 32 to hit?

1617
01:45:42,313 --> 01:45:44,730
MARISHA: What? 32?

1618
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:45,587
MATT: 32 to hit.

1619
01:45:45,587 --> 01:45:47,302
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

1620
01:45:47,302 --> 01:45:53,357
MATT: 25 points of slashing damage.

1621
01:45:53,357 --> 01:45:57,669
MARISHA: 17 plus 20. Plus 23--

1622
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:59,753
LAURA: What are you doing concentration on?

1623
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:01,619
MARISHA: My Sunbeam.

1624
01:46:01,619 --> 01:46:03,002
LAURA: Oh, right.

1625
01:46:03,002 --> 01:46:12,621
MATT: So that's 23 points of slashing damage, plus
23 points of fire damage. So a total of 46.

1626
01:46:12,621 --> 01:46:23,446
MARISHA: Can I use my reaction to cast Absorb
Elements?

1627
01:46:23,446 --> 01:46:25,629
MATT: If you have it prepared, yeah.

1628
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:26,682
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

1629
01:46:26,682 --> 01:46:30,596
MATT: Which allows you to?

1630
01:46:30,596 --> 01:46:38,715
MARISHA: Never done this before. Let me
double-check. I capture some of the energy and I

1631
01:46:38,715 --> 01:46:44,919
store it, and I have resistance to the next damage
type that I take that, and the first time I hit

1632
01:46:44,919 --> 01:46:49,719
with a melee attack on my next turn, I can do an
extra 1d6 of that damage type.

1633
01:46:49,719 --> 01:46:51,796
MATT: So you take 11 points of fire damage
instead.

1634
01:46:51,796 --> 01:46:52,749
MARISHA: Beautiful.

1635
01:46:52,749 --> 01:46:54,801
MATT: So, it does 34 points of damage total.

1636
01:46:54,801 --> 01:47:10,453
MARISHA: So another 11 would've made it 82. Okay.
I have to beat a ten, correct?

1637
01:47:10,453 --> 01:47:17,458
MATT: No, you have beat half of the 34, which
would be 17. So you have to beat a 17.

1638
01:47:17,458 --> 01:47:19,324
MARISHA: Nope. Wait, what do I add?

1639
01:47:19,324 --> 01:47:21,448
MATT: Your constitution saving throw.

1640
01:47:21,448 --> 01:47:26,683
MARISHA: Oh! No, I'm good, then. I'm good, that's
exactly a 17?

1641
01:47:26,683 --> 01:47:32,171
MATT: Okay. Then that's fine, you succeed. And
then the tail's going to slam down onto you as

1642
01:47:32,171 --> 01:47:36,827
well, Keyleth. With advantage on that. 16. Natural
20.

1643
01:47:36,827 --> 01:47:38,046
MARISHA: What?

1644
01:47:38,046 --> 01:47:40,552
TRAVIS: Matthew!

1645
01:47:40,552 --> 01:47:41,942
MATT: Natural 20.

1646
01:47:41,942 --> 01:47:43,552
LAURA: But, wait, what did the next melee attack
do to you?

1647
01:47:43,552 --> 01:47:44,607
MATT: This is the tail.

1648
01:47:44,607 --> 01:47:45,961
MARISHA: It's me attacking.

1649
01:47:45,961 --> 01:47:52,280
MATT: It's a nine, a ten, and a seven on 3d10, so
that is--

1650
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,990
TRAVIS: Oh god.

1651
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:58,333
MATT: 62 points of bludgeoning damage.

1652
01:47:58,333 --> 01:48:01,627
MARISHA: 60-- wait, how?!

1653
01:48:01,627 --> 01:48:02,883
SAM: Halved.

1654
01:48:02,883 --> 01:48:05,085
MARISHA: Halved. Is it halved? Wait, what?

1655
01:48:05,085 --> 01:48:06,307
MATT, MARISHA AND SAM: No.

1656
01:48:06,307 --> 01:48:07,229
MARISHA: It's not.

1657
01:48:07,229 --> 01:48:08,244
SAM: I just like saying that.

1658
01:48:08,244 --> 01:48:15,629
MATT: Well, sorry, it's 20-- it was 52 points,
because it was a ten, a nine, and a seven. So it

1659
01:48:15,629 --> 01:48:24,785
would've been 26, just the dice, crit is 52, plus
ten, 62. 62 points.

1660
01:48:24,785 --> 01:48:26,823
MARISHA: I mean, I'm still up.

1661
01:48:26,823 --> 01:48:28,532
SAM: Hey, that's good.

1662
01:48:28,532 --> 01:48:34,295
MARISHA: With 20 hit points. No. I was at 82 minus
62, which means--

1663
01:48:34,295 --> 01:48:35,498
LAURA: 20 points.

1664
01:48:35,498 --> 01:48:36,684
MARISHA: 20 points.

1665
01:48:36,684 --> 01:48:40,809
NOELLE: So, seeing as he, like, landed on me,
could I do anything here? Any reaction?

1666
01:48:40,809 --> 01:48:43,153
MATT: Do you have a reaction to do?

1667
01:48:43,153 --> 01:48:44,628
NOELLE: I don't know. (laughs)

1668
01:48:44,628 --> 01:48:47,248
MATT: No, not really, you're just like, "Urgh!"
You're being sat on by the pit fiend.

1669
01:48:47,248 --> 01:48:50,781
NOELLE: Even if I was upright, be like a
pincushion to sit on?

1670
01:48:50,781 --> 01:48:54,020
MATT: I mean, you're holding it off, but his heavy
hide against your pincushion-type nails is not

1671
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:56,309
going to do much unless you're physically
attacking behind it.

1672
01:48:56,309 --> 01:48:58,085
NOELLE: Icicles.

1673
01:48:58,085 --> 01:49:00,429
MATT: I know. And he's resistant to cold, sorry.

1674
01:49:00,429 --> 01:49:02,858
NOELLE: Just thought I'd check.

1675
01:49:02,858 --> 01:49:04,201
MATT: Vax.

1676
01:49:04,201 --> 01:49:08,956
LIAM: All right, well, my enemy is gone. Percival
just shot it through the face, so. I start to fly

1677
01:49:08,956 --> 01:49:13,504
towards the entrance. The moment I come through
and I see Keyleth mangled on the ground

1678
01:49:13,504 --> 01:49:19,363
underneath, I just react and fly straight at the
thing and snag onto his chest like an angry,

1679
01:49:19,363 --> 01:49:21,952
pissed-off cat, and I just start slicing.

1680
01:49:21,952 --> 01:49:25,514
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1681
01:49:25,514 --> 01:49:28,712
LIAM: I'm actually going to bonus action Hunter's
Mark him as I land. I'm going to move the Hunter's

1682
01:49:28,712 --> 01:49:31,266
Mark, excuse me, from the slain guy.

1683
01:49:31,266 --> 01:49:32,362
MATT: Okay.

1684
01:49:32,362 --> 01:49:36,831
LIAM: Yep, and okay, and here we go. That is shit.
No, well, it's 16. I'm sure it doesn't hit.

1685
01:49:36,831 --> 01:49:38,472
MATT: 16 does not hit, no.

1686
01:49:38,472 --> 01:49:40,682
LIAM: Okay. That is 19.

1687
01:49:40,682 --> 01:49:45,590
MATT: 19 does not hit, either. Both angry strikes
just hit the hide, but it's too strong, and the

1688
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:48,793
devilish scales deflecting the piercing blows.

1689
01:49:48,793 --> 01:49:49,973
LIAM: I'm going to stay hanging on.

1690
01:49:49,973 --> 01:49:51,745
MATT: Okay. Vex, you're up.

1691
01:49:51,745 --> 01:49:54,578
LAURA: Okay. Hey, I can see him now.

1692
01:49:54,578 --> 01:49:59,611
MATT: You can. It's also sitting, currently, on
Tova and Keyleth. Keyleth is looking pretty banged

1693
01:49:59,611 --> 01:50:03,994
up. Tova's looking pretty banged up, and your
brother is hacking at it to no avail.

1694
01:50:03,994 --> 01:50:08,689
LAURA: I don't know what all I could see of that
other than just the pit fiend's arm through the

1695
01:50:08,689 --> 01:50:14,692
window, but I'm going to back up and shoot him.
I'm going to Hunter's Mark him first, though!

1696
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:16,793
MATT: Okay.

1697
01:50:16,793 --> 01:50:20,411
LAURA: And I'm going to-- yeah, that's what I'm
going to do.

1698
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:25,174
MATT: Okay. As you back up, he does get a reaction
attack of opportunity, because he has a reach.

1699
01:50:25,174 --> 01:50:26,905
LAURA: Through the window?

1700
01:50:26,905 --> 01:50:32,997
MATT: Yeah. As you back up, the tail, after smashing at
Keyleth, goes (whoosh) and whips through the

1701
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:38,226
window towards you. That's going to be a 25 to
hit.

1702
01:50:38,226 --> 01:50:40,340
LAURA: Yeah, sure, whatever.

1703
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:45,070
MATT: That is 21 points of bludgeoning damage
against you.

1704
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:46,064
LAURA: Great.

1705
01:50:46,064 --> 01:50:49,581
MATT: The tail almost sends you off your feet,
almost knocking the wind out of you from the

1706
01:50:49,581 --> 01:50:53,201
impact to your chest and stomach area. But you
slide and catch yourself before

1707
01:50:53,201 --> 01:50:54,338
tumbling backward.

1708
01:50:54,338 --> 01:50:56,906
LAURA: (sighs) I hate you. Hunter's Mark!

1709
01:50:56,906 --> 01:50:58,964
TRAVIS: Why do you need Hunter's Mark?

1710
01:50:58,964 --> 01:51:00,476
LAURA: Well, you know.

1711
01:51:00,476 --> 01:51:04,174
LIAM: I think this is going to be a negative, but
a quick clarification question. With them on the

1712
01:51:04,174 --> 01:51:07,055
ground, then there's no flanking bonus, or
anything--

1713
01:51:07,055 --> 01:51:08,940
MATT: Nope, they are not threatening him
currently.

1714
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,274
LIAM: That's what I thought. Checking.

1715
01:51:10,274 --> 01:51:13,753
MATT: They have to be threatening them to be
giving that bonus.

1716
01:51:13,753 --> 01:51:15,238
TRAVIS: Tickle!

1717
01:51:15,238 --> 01:51:16,681
MATT: (laughs) They are currently under his rump.

1718
01:51:16,681 --> 01:51:18,096
LAURA: The first one is a one.

1719
01:51:18,096 --> 01:51:19,461
SAM: Yay.

1720
01:51:19,461 --> 01:51:23,757
MATT: The impact from the chest blow ends up, as
you go to grab the arrow, you're already kind of a

1721
01:51:23,757 --> 01:51:26,123
little off-aim from the the wooziness.

1722
01:51:26,123 --> 01:51:34,022
LAURA: (grunts in pain) All right. That's fine.
I'm going to hit him again, though, or try. That

1723
01:51:34,022 --> 01:51:37,090
is-- I can add-- 23.

1724
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:38,279
MATT: 23 hits.

1725
01:51:38,279 --> 01:51:54,985
LAURA: Yes. Okay. Yes! 18 plus one lightning
damage, plus 2d6, here we go, and two ones! I'm

1726
01:51:54,985 --> 01:52:01,307
rolling great! Woo!

1727
01:52:01,307 --> 01:52:03,409
NOELLE: Want to borrow some dice?

1728
01:52:03,409 --> 01:52:11,491
LAURA: All of these. All of you guys are goodbyes.
And you're a goodbye, too. You can stay.

1729
01:52:11,491 --> 01:52:15,554
MATT: All right, so. How much damage was that,
total?

1730
01:52:15,554 --> 01:52:17,665
LAURA: Huh? How much was that?

1731
01:52:17,665 --> 01:52:18,666
MATT: Yeah.

1732
01:52:18,666 --> 01:52:23,572
LAURA: Oh. 19 total. One of those was lightning
damage.

1733
01:52:23,572 --> 01:52:29,278
MATT: Okay, good. So, the second arrow does hit.
And you're seeing now, Utugash, while looming over

1734
01:52:29,348 --> 01:52:33,891
and seemingly impervious, at close view, as you
get a glance backing up, is looking pretty hurt.

1735
01:52:33,891 --> 01:52:40,830
Previously, as it's now your second time battling
a pit fiend, you're able to see the faint cracks

1736
01:52:40,830 --> 01:52:46,508
that you're beginning to notice generally show a
lot more damage than they do on the surface. So

1737
01:52:46,508 --> 01:52:50,622
you're starting to see signs of wear, which, based
on your previous battle, leads you to believe it's

1738
01:52:50,622 --> 01:52:56,779
actually pretty hurt. That ends your turn, Vax.
And Vex.

1739
01:52:56,779 --> 01:52:59,978
LAURA: I'm going to back up. I can use the rest of
my movement, right?

1740
01:52:59,978 --> 01:53:01,304
MATT: You can, yeah.

1741
01:53:01,304 --> 01:53:03,769
LAURA: And back up around that corner so I'm
parallel with Percy there. Yeah, right there.

1742
01:53:03,769 --> 01:53:07,138
MATT: Okay. Cool. That brings us to Taryon. I need
you to roll a death saving throw.

1743
01:53:07,138 --> 01:53:11,280
SAM: Oh, sure. Yeah. Can I feel lucky?

1744
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:12,786
MATT: You can, technically.

1745
01:53:12,786 --> 01:53:15,046
SAM: Oh, that's worse.

1746
01:53:15,046 --> 01:53:17,060
(laughter)

1747
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:18,944
MATT: So that's one failed death saving throw on
Tary.

1748
01:53:18,944 --> 01:53:20,771
NOELLE: Tary.

1749
01:53:20,771 --> 01:53:22,511
LAURA: I just have a quick question.

1750
01:53:22,511 --> 01:53:23,450
MATT: Yeah?

1751
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:28,426
LAURA: Since I I haven't used this very much. The
Disengage feat that the rogues have, is that a

1752
01:53:28,599 --> 01:53:29,669
bonus action?

1753
01:53:29,669 --> 01:53:31,097
MATT: It's a bonus action to disengage, yeah.

1754
01:53:31,097 --> 01:53:32,133
LAURA: Okay. Just checking.

1755
01:53:32,133 --> 01:53:34,071
MATT: Yeah. You'd already moved your Hunter's
Mark, unfortunately, but going forward,

1756
01:53:34,071 --> 01:53:35,316
you can do that.

1757
01:53:35,316 --> 01:53:36,788
LIAM: It's a zig-zag motion.

1758
01:53:36,788 --> 01:53:38,756
TRAVIS: Serpentine!

1759
01:53:38,756 --> 01:53:40,490
MATT: Now.

1760
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:42,409
TRAVIS: Now what?

1761
01:53:42,409 --> 01:53:44,973
NOELLE: Don't press any more buttons.

1762
01:53:44,973 --> 01:53:51,665
MATT: Two imps that were previously invisible in
the room and hitting the various buttons across

1763
01:53:51,665 --> 01:53:53,256
the back wall at his command--

1764
01:53:53,256 --> 01:53:55,068
LAURA: Oh, it was those fucks.

1765
01:53:55,068 --> 01:54:03,702
MATT: Appear and both fly down, swinging towards
Keyleth, who's currently pinned underneath. And

1766
01:54:03,702 --> 01:54:11,324
are just going to begin to start attempting to
bite at her. Or, these are the stings, so with

1767
01:54:11,574 --> 01:54:17,593
advantage, that is six plus five. That is 11. The
first one, the stinger hits you, it just can't

1768
01:54:17,593 --> 01:54:25,250
pierce the armor. The second one is going to go
ahead, and with advantage, that is a 13. Just

1769
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:30,599
can't pierce the armor. Little imps, they're
like-- (snarls) And Utugash is like, "Ugh, hungry

1770
01:54:30,599 --> 01:54:38,255
"carrion wraiths." That brings us to Keyleth.

1771
01:54:38,255 --> 01:54:50,184
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay. Time to go big. I am going
to cast Shapechange, my 9th-level spell, and I am

1772
01:54:50,184 --> 01:54:53,358
going to turn into a fire giant.

1773
01:54:53,358 --> 01:54:56,308
LAURA: A fire giant?

1774
01:54:56,308 --> 01:55:05,436
MARISHA: Yeah! So as I'm down, my eyes light up,
and I start to turn into a giant. And I want to

1775
01:55:05,436 --> 01:55:13,747
reach up and grab him by the throat and try and
stand up and see if I can pile-drive him.

1776
01:55:13,747 --> 01:55:17,979
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and roll your attack for your
fire giant.

1777
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:19,570
LIAM: I'm going for a ride.

1778
01:55:19,570 --> 01:55:22,961
LAURA: Are you attached to him?

1779
01:55:22,961 --> 01:55:24,521
TRAVIS: Are you super strong?

1780
01:55:24,521 --> 01:55:28,180
MARISHA: I am. Is this plus 11 just to my
attacks?

1781
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:32,005
MATT: Everyone else gets pushed out of the way. So
yes.

1782
01:55:32,005 --> 01:55:33,365
MARISHA: Natural 20!

1783
01:55:33,365 --> 01:55:37,113
(cheering)

1784
01:55:37,113 --> 01:55:38,408
MARISHA: Thanks, Gil!

1785
01:55:38,408 --> 01:55:43,045
LAURA: That made up for all the rest of the times
he fucked us during this game.

1786
01:55:43,045 --> 01:55:50,128
MATT: So, Tova and the imps get pushed aside as
Keyleth's form suddenly encompasses most of the

1787
01:55:50,128 --> 01:56:00,111
corner of the room. Natural 20. You grab Utugash
by the throat. Grab the torso, lift him up, slam

1788
01:56:00,111 --> 01:56:05,603
him onto the ground. Go ahead and roll just the
basic damage for the fire elemental's attack. It

1789
01:56:05,603 --> 01:56:08,929
doesn't knock him prone, but this is the flavor
for the attack.

1790
01:56:08,929 --> 01:56:11,231
MARISHA: How do you know what basic damage is?

1791
01:56:11,231 --> 01:56:13,035
MATT: Look for the attack for the fire giant.

1792
01:56:13,035 --> 01:56:15,280
MARISHA: Well, it just gives me multi-attack.

1793
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,015
MATT: And underneath that, it says?

1794
01:56:17,015 --> 01:56:20,255
MARISHA: And it gives me a greatsword melee
attack.

1795
01:56:20,255 --> 01:56:23,244
MATT: Yeah, just roll the damage for the
greatsword. The attack is

1796
01:56:23,244 --> 01:56:25,370
the flavor of the strike.

1797
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:30,768
MARISHA: That is 6d6. That is one, two, three,
four. I need one more.

1798
01:56:30,768 --> 01:56:38,387
LIAM: I'm on this guy's chest, by the way, and he
goes down, and it's landing on the ground, I love

1799
01:56:38,387 --> 01:56:39,941
what you do!

1800
01:56:39,941 --> 01:56:41,444
(laughter)

1801
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:43,491
LIAM: And I want to somersault away.

1802
01:56:43,491 --> 01:56:51,462
MARISHA: Ten, 16, 24 damage.

1803
01:56:51,533 --> 01:56:53,444
MATT: How much did you roll?

1804
01:56:53,444 --> 01:56:54,453
MARISHA: 24.

1805
01:56:54,453 --> 01:56:55,444
TRAVIS: 24.

1806
01:56:55,444 --> 01:56:56,753
MATT: 24. That was with the double?

1807
01:56:56,753 --> 01:57:01,951
MARISHA: Right! So, doubled that, so 48 damage.

1808
01:57:01,951 --> 01:57:03,245
MATT: Plus seven.

1809
01:57:03,245 --> 01:57:04,769
MARISHA: Plus seven, yeah!

1810
01:57:04,769 --> 01:57:09,106
MATT: Yeah. So that is 55 points of damage.

1811
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:12,488
MARISHA: (grunts)

1812
01:57:12,488 --> 01:57:14,490
LAURA: Just say it. I want to hear you say it.

1813
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:17,067
MATT: Well, it's not there yet.

1814
01:57:17,067 --> 01:57:18,684
(groaning)

1815
01:57:18,684 --> 01:57:23,526
MATT: Technically your action was to cast the
spell, and you wouldn't have the ability to attack

1816
01:57:23,526 --> 01:57:27,924
in the same round. But I'm letting you do it,
because why not. Because it's fun.

1817
01:57:27,924 --> 01:57:29,526
MARISHA: Well, I didn't move.

1818
01:57:29,526 --> 01:57:31,227
MATT: It's fine.

1819
01:57:31,227 --> 01:57:32,805
(laughter)

1820
01:57:32,805 --> 01:57:39,581
MATT: And we'll say you can't move, this turn. But
it was fun. It was cool, why not? All right. That

1821
01:57:39,581 --> 01:57:40,839
ends your turn, Keyleth?

1822
01:57:40,839 --> 01:57:42,020
MARISHA: Yeah.

1823
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:45,077
MATT: Tova. Grog.

1824
01:57:45,077 --> 01:57:49,673
NOELLE: All right. Let's just go all out, here.
I'm going to cast--

1825
01:57:49,673 --> 01:57:51,645
MATT: It's looking really rough, by the way.

1826
01:57:51,645 --> 01:57:55,859
NOELLE: -- Blood Curse of the Marked, on Utugash.
I'm going to amplify it.

1827
01:57:55,859 --> 01:57:57,298
MATT: All righty.

1828
01:57:57,298 --> 01:58:07,751
NOELLE: Four. Four damage for me. And then I'm
going to slide in under this fire giant's legs and

1829
01:58:07,751 --> 01:58:11,730
go for it with my claws and the Crimson Rite.

1830
01:58:11,730 --> 01:58:16,990
MATT: All righty, so at half movement, that's
five, ten, 15, 20. You can just get into combat

1831
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:19,913
range right there. Knocking Vax over and killing
him.

1832
01:58:19,913 --> 01:58:22,718
ALL: (chanting) Tova. Tova. Tova.

1833
01:58:22,718 --> 01:58:24,806
NOELLE: All right, so that's a 28 to hit on one.

1834
01:58:24,806 --> 01:58:26,230
MATT: That hits.

1835
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:28,427
NOELLE: And that is a 24 to hit on the second.

1836
01:58:28,427 --> 01:58:29,333
MATT: That hits.

1837
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:32,215
LAURA: That die's so much better.

1838
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:44,129
NOELLE: All right, so that is 11. That is a 13.
And I get two more, yeah? Matt?

1839
01:58:44,129 --> 01:58:46,286
With my Crimson Rite?

1840
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:52,389
MATT: With the claws you do 2d8, and these are
doubled because you did your mark.

1841
01:58:52,389 --> 01:58:53,642
NOELLE: Okay.

1842
01:58:53,642 --> 01:58:54,848
MATT: So, what did you roll?

1843
01:58:54,848 --> 01:58:58,857
NOELLE: A seven. Seven for the 2d8. And then, what
did I say, 13 and 11 the first time?

1844
01:58:58,857 --> 01:59:04,207
MATT: Yes. So, it's 13 and 11 for the actual
weapon damage, for the claws. And then now, what

1845
01:59:04,207 --> 01:59:05,671
did you roll for the first?

1846
01:59:05,671 --> 01:59:06,864
NOELLE: Seven, together.

1847
01:59:06,864 --> 01:59:10,652
MATT: Seven together. So that's 14?

1848
01:59:10,706 --> 01:59:12,009
How do you want to do this?

1849
01:59:12,009 --> 01:59:14,341
(cheering)

1850
01:59:14,341 --> 01:59:20,304
MATT: Two guests in a row! All right, so how do
you want to do that? As you watch, the fire giant,

1851
01:59:20,304 --> 01:59:24,788
clutching it by the throat and slamming it onto
the ground, Utugash is in this sort of wrestling

1852
01:59:24,788 --> 01:59:26,831
ring encounter in the center of the room.

1853
01:59:26,831 --> 01:59:35,134
NOELLE: Just going to fucking body slam him with
my bear body and going to hit him with both my

1854
01:59:35,134 --> 01:59:39,207
claws. Going to tear his fucking throat out.

1855
01:59:39,207 --> 01:59:40,319
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah!

1856
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:42,231
NOELLE: And I'm going to look down at him, and I'm
going to be like,

1857
01:59:42,231 --> 01:59:44,995
how do you like me now, asshole?

1858
01:59:44,995 --> 01:59:52,110
MATT: So. Keyleth. In the impressive moment of
slamming Utugash down, the grip you have on the

1859
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:58,187
throat is loosened suddenly as a secondary force
pushes Utugash out of your grip. What looks to be

1860
01:59:58,187 --> 02:00:03,926
a bowling ball of a fur-like bear form goes
slamming into the torso of the devil, who then

1861
02:00:03,926 --> 02:00:09,432
falls onto the back, as the bear just begins
Wolverine berserker barraging, tearing through the

1862
02:00:09,506 --> 02:00:15,284
chest and torso cavity of the devil. Drops the
axe, and is trying to reach up and is clawing at

1863
02:00:15,284 --> 02:00:19,704
your back and tearing through flesh. You can feel
the blood, but you're too focused at this point,

1864
02:00:19,704 --> 02:00:23,634
the frenzy kicking in from your transformation.
And as you stare down and say that into his face,

1865
02:00:23,634 --> 02:00:34,439
Utugash's tongue is lolling back across the tusks
and says, "We'll still find you." And just goes

1866
02:00:34,439 --> 02:00:37,689
limp across the ground.

1867
02:00:37,689 --> 02:00:41,679
NOELLE: (deep exhale)

1868
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:49,252
MARISHA: I stand up, and I look at Grog. And in
Giant I say, "'Sup."

1869
02:00:49,252 --> 02:00:53,262
TRAVIS: 'Sup, playa?

1870
02:00:53,262 --> 02:00:54,547
MARISHA: What's up, man?

1871
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:56,147
TRAVIS: Damn, you be talkin' my lingo!

1872
02:00:56,147 --> 02:00:57,537
MARISHA: Yeah!

1873
02:00:57,537 --> 02:01:03,507
NOELLE: I'm going to spit on him while I'm still
standing. And I'm just going to flop on my back,

1874
02:01:03,507 --> 02:01:09,378
turn back into a dwarf. Be like, "Hey, you guys
want to get a beer?"

1875
02:01:09,378 --> 02:01:11,514
TALIESIN: Aren't there still two--

1876
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:17,386
MATT: There are two imps in the chamber. But they
both turn invisible as soon as this happens. And

1877
02:01:17,386 --> 02:01:21,909
they're attempting to escape as the flame wall
disappears, and you see Taryon bleeding out on the

1878
02:01:21,909 --> 02:01:24,251
ground. Next to his superheated--

1879
02:01:24,251 --> 02:01:26,946
LIAM: Oh. I land and Lay on Hands

1880
02:01:26,946 --> 02:01:28,825
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you're close enough to do so.

1881
02:01:28,825 --> 02:01:33,119
LIAM: Okay. I'll give him ten.

1882
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,417
MATT: Okay.

1883
02:01:34,417 --> 02:01:36,381
TRAVIS: Maybe we just toss him in the blood.

1884
02:01:36,381 --> 02:01:39,631
MATT: So how much do you give him?

1885
02:01:39,631 --> 02:01:40,929
LIAM: Ten.

1886
02:01:40,929 --> 02:01:42,872
MATT: Ten. So you have ten hit points. And you
come to consciousness.

1887
02:01:42,872 --> 02:01:46,142
SAM: Oh! I had the craziest dream.

1888
02:01:46,142 --> 02:01:47,143
LIAM: Slap!

1889
02:01:47,143 --> 02:01:48,530
SAM: Oh!

1890
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:51,392
LIAM: Are you all right? Are you really all right?
Are you having fun?

1891
02:01:51,392 --> 02:01:53,096
SAM: Did I kill it? Again?

1892
02:01:53,096 --> 02:01:56,102
LIAM: Stone-cold dead, you did. Congratulations.

1893
02:01:56,102 --> 02:01:58,355
MATT: I will say, Keyleth?

1894
02:01:58,469 --> 02:01:59,612
MARISHA: Yeah?

1895
02:01:59,612 --> 02:02:01,612
MATT: Because technically they were in melee range
with you, since you pushed them out of the way, as

1896
02:02:01,612 --> 02:02:04,284
they vanish you do get one attack of opportunity
across them with disadvantage.

1897
02:02:04,284 --> 02:02:07,119
MARISHA: Ooh! Am I still all fire giant form?

1898
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:08,057
MATT: Yes you are.

1899
02:02:08,057 --> 02:02:10,313
MARISHA: That's cool. Okay. With disadvantage?

1900
02:02:10,313 --> 02:02:11,371
MATT: With disadvantage.

1901
02:02:11,371 --> 02:02:12,313
MARISHA: On both of them?

1902
02:02:12,313 --> 02:02:13,434
MATT: On just one of them.

1903
02:02:13,434 --> 02:02:14,232
MARISHA: Just one of them?

1904
02:02:14,232 --> 02:02:15,520
MATT: Because you only have one reaction.

1905
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,568
MARISHA: That's eight plus 11, so that's 20--

1906
02:02:18,568 --> 02:02:19,675
LAURA: 19.

1907
02:02:19,675 --> 02:02:21,418
MATT: That still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1908
02:02:21,418 --> 02:02:22,483
TALIESIN: That's plenty.

1909
02:02:22,483 --> 02:02:27,108
MARISHA: So that's 7d6 plus six. One, two--

1910
02:02:27,108 --> 02:02:30,843
MATT: Don't roll damage. Because even if you
rolled all ones, it's just enough to kill it, it

1911
02:02:30,843 --> 02:02:36,253
has 13 hit points. So, as they both vanish, and
you hear the flapping of wings, you just do one

1912
02:02:36,253 --> 02:02:43,190
wide, Hail Mary arc with your fist, and just
(whoosh) and (squeaking screech). One imp just

1913
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:49,390
gets spattered across the back of your knuckles.
But the other you hear (wings flapping) fly off.

1914
02:02:49,447 --> 02:02:57,220
MARISHA: (very deep voice) I imagine he's going to
tell the others. Oh, this Shapechange has so many

1915
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:59,043
weird things!

1916
02:02:59,043 --> 02:03:01,808
TALIESIN: If I have a moment, I'm going to look in
all those doors really quickly.

1917
02:03:01,808 --> 02:03:05,280
LAURA: I'm going to run over to Percy and give him
a kiss and say, nice shooting, stud, and I'm going

1918
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:06,435
to help him look.

1919
02:03:06,435 --> 02:03:10,197
TALIESIN: Okay, then I'm going to wait one second,
not to look in those doors. But that happens. And

1920
02:03:10,197 --> 02:03:11,832
then-- Yeah.

1921
02:03:11,832 --> 02:03:15,503
SAM: In fear, I stand up and throw my lance at the
fire giant.

1922
02:03:15,503 --> 02:03:17,861
(laughter)

1923
02:03:17,861 --> 02:03:19,810
MATT: Roll an attack!

1924
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:21,435
MARISHA: That's fantastic!

1925
02:03:21,435 --> 02:03:24,084
SAM: That's a 14.

1926
02:03:24,084 --> 02:03:25,346
MATT: What's your AC?

1927
02:03:25,346 --> 02:03:26,331
MARISHA: 18.

1928
02:03:26,331 --> 02:03:28,479
MATT: The lance ricochets off your chest.

1929
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:31,376
SAM: Are you seeing this? Are you all seeing
this?

1930
02:03:31,376 --> 02:03:34,672
LIAM: No, that's the Tempest, that's the Tempest,
man. That's Kiki, that's Keyleth.

1931
02:03:34,672 --> 02:03:38,399
MARISHA: Hi, Tary! I'm Antlers!

1932
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:43,110
SAM: Oh! Good day to you, miss. I've misjudged you
again.

1933
02:03:43,110 --> 02:03:45,079
MARISHA: Fist bump.

1934
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:45,981
SAM: No!

1935
02:03:45,981 --> 02:03:50,066
LAURA: I shout through the window, loot the body!
And I keep looking in the things with Percy.

1936
02:03:50,066 --> 02:03:55,838
MATT: Okay. As you glance through the various
openings, there're a bunch of cells. Some are

1937
02:03:55,838 --> 02:04:04,824
empty, some contain long-dead, rotting corpses.
The first room that you go into contains a fair

1938
02:04:04,893 --> 02:04:06,699
amount of gold, and it's just stashed--

1939
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:08,203
TALIESIN: We pull it.

1940
02:04:08,203 --> 02:04:11,713
MATT: This small stash here is about 12,300 gold
pieces.

1941
02:04:11,713 --> 02:04:14,665
LAURA: (sings) Yeah! Putting that in the stash.

1942
02:04:14,665 --> 02:04:18,631
MATT: You also find your equipment. You find your
maul and your armor.

1943
02:04:18,631 --> 02:04:20,744
LAURA: 12,300, you said?

1944
02:04:20,744 --> 02:04:25,463
MATT: 12,300 gold. So you have that at your
disposal now.

1945
02:04:25,463 --> 02:04:32,813
NOELLE: I go over, and I'm really happy to put my
armor back on over my cool bear bikini

1946
02:04:32,813 --> 02:04:34,634
that I have on.

1947
02:04:34,634 --> 02:04:35,634
(laughter)

1948
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:36,944
MATT, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Your bear-kini.

1949
02:04:36,944 --> 02:04:41,610
MATT: As you're putting your armor on, you open
the far door on this end, and as you do, suddenly

1950
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:48,453
bursting through is a lemure. (groans) Comes
towards you with its horrible, fleshy mound just

1951
02:04:48,453 --> 02:04:50,037
reaching out in your direction.

1952
02:04:50,037 --> 02:05:01,411
TALIESIN: I threaten it down, and say, run. And
owe Orthax your freedom. Run!

1953
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:03,560
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

1954
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:06,408
TALIESIN: Okay, can I use Friends to help with
that or no, just go for intimidation?

1955
02:05:06,408 --> 02:05:08,067
MATT: If you want to.

1956
02:05:08,067 --> 02:05:12,020
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll use Friends to add to that
intimidation. So, is that advantage?

1957
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:13,031
MATT: Yes.

1958
02:05:13,031 --> 02:05:25,297
TALIESIN: All right. That's cocked. That's fine
anyway. Intimidation is, ugh, eight.

1959
02:05:25,297 --> 02:05:27,437
MARISHA: Aww!

1960
02:05:27,437 --> 02:05:33,747
MATT: As you say "Run!", and you see the whole--
the lemure goes (curious grunt).

1961
02:05:33,747 --> 02:05:35,312
TALIESIN: I shoot my gun next to it.

1962
02:05:35,312 --> 02:05:36,792
LAURA: I shoot an arrow into it.

1963
02:05:36,792 --> 02:05:39,370
MATT: It's actually just going to reach out and
strike at you.

1964
02:05:39,370 --> 02:05:42,043
Then the arrow strike comes right after.

1965
02:05:42,043 --> 02:05:46,607
LIAM: Vax Dagons onto Keyleth's shoulder and
watches all this through the window.

1966
02:05:46,607 --> 02:05:51,913
MATT: It misses. His hand slaps against the front
of your armor and (slurping, groan), and then roll

1967
02:05:51,913 --> 02:05:52,907
your attack.

1968
02:05:52,907 --> 02:05:55,452
NOELLE: (laughs) This is a great confrontation!

1969
02:05:55,691 --> 02:05:56,724
LAURA: 21.

1970
02:05:56,724 --> 02:05:58,366
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1971
02:05:58,366 --> 02:05:59,384
LIAM: This is weird.

1972
02:05:59,384 --> 02:06:01,249
(laughter)

1973
02:06:01,249 --> 02:06:04,234
LIAM: Good weird, but it's weird.

1974
02:06:04,234 --> 02:06:09,336
LAURA: 18.

1975
02:06:09,336 --> 02:06:14,058
MATT: The arrow (impact noise) through its head,
and it just immediately falls to the ground.

1976
02:06:14,058 --> 02:06:15,819
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm losing it.

1977
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:20,789
LAURA: He should've listened. You were very clear,
dear.

1978
02:06:20,789 --> 02:06:23,254
TALIESIN: What's in the other room?

1979
02:06:23,254 --> 02:06:25,936
(laughter)

1980
02:06:25,936 --> 02:06:36,163
MATT: The rest of the chambers here, you find most
of it is a collection of rotting meats. You find

1981
02:06:36,163 --> 02:06:45,215
various sulfurous chemicals, some that you can't
really, by scent and texture, identify.

1982
02:06:45,215 --> 02:06:47,390
TALIESIN: If there's anything interesting?

1983
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:51,644
MATT: Okay, we'll say that you have a handful of
chemicals that you may be able to look into later.

1984
02:06:51,644 --> 02:06:53,849
Five vials, specifically.

1985
02:06:53,849 --> 02:07:00,550
TALIESIN: Anything on the body? On the giant? On
the pit fiend.

1986
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:05,534
MATT: Utugash? There's the axe that Utugash had,
which is this very, very large black,

1987
02:07:05,534 --> 02:07:08,617
metal heated axe.

1988
02:07:08,617 --> 02:07:10,714
TRAVIS: Can I see that, please?

1989
02:07:10,714 --> 02:07:13,122
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1990
02:07:13,122 --> 02:07:21,045
MARISHA: Can I pick him up by his ankles and
schoolyard bully-style shake him out from his

1991
02:07:21,045 --> 02:07:23,103
feet, upside-down?

1992
02:07:23,103 --> 02:07:24,188
SAM: For pocket change?

1993
02:07:24,188 --> 02:07:25,414
MARISHA: For pocket change.

1994
02:07:25,414 --> 02:07:32,188
MATT: Even for your giant strength, you're like
(grunts). He's a very rotund pit fiend, and the

1995
02:07:32,188 --> 02:07:39,369
red scales, leathery blubber as it moves around--
there wasn't much that he was carrying on him.

1996
02:07:39,369 --> 02:07:46,600
Most pit fiends, or at least devilish creatures of
his stature, don't keep his belongings hidden

1997
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:48,828
anywhere on himself. They're visible.

1998
02:07:48,828 --> 02:07:50,934
LIAM: That's a pretty big meatball.

1999
02:07:50,934 --> 02:07:52,615
LAURA: Some spicy meatball.

2000
02:07:52,615 --> 02:07:58,256
TRAVIS: Does the axe do anything when I hold it?

2001
02:07:58,256 --> 02:08:05,909
MATT: It's roughly twice the size of any axe
you've held and is too large for you to use.

2002
02:08:05,909 --> 02:08:07,849
LAURA AND NOELLE: Aw.

2003
02:08:07,849 --> 02:08:11,303
TRAVIS: I really think that's a matter of
perspective?

2004
02:08:11,303 --> 02:08:15,083
SAM: Would you like me to identify the object?

2005
02:08:15,083 --> 02:08:16,434
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2006
02:08:16,434 --> 02:08:17,685
SAM: All right.

2007
02:08:17,685 --> 02:08:19,740
MATT: Okay.

2008
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:21,292
LIAM: Weakly limps over.

2009
02:08:21,292 --> 02:08:23,309
SAM: Aye, I'll take a look at it.

2010
02:08:23,309 --> 02:08:35,165
MATT: Okay. It's referred to as a Black Iron Axe
of Corruption. It's used primarily as a means of

2011
02:08:35,165 --> 02:08:42,139
intimidating and scaring off lessers, and keeping
subordinates in line.

2012
02:08:42,139 --> 02:08:44,465
SAM: With magic, or just with size?

2013
02:08:44,465 --> 02:08:50,186
MATT: Both. It's a minor enchantment. The
enchantment of it, you get the essence as you look

2014
02:08:50,186 --> 02:08:56,669
at it, the power of it was part of the presence of
the pit fiend, it was an inherent ability, so

2015
02:08:56,669 --> 02:09:02,345
yeah. This is not considered a very powerful
magical item. It was only powerful in the hands of

2016
02:09:02,345 --> 02:09:03,861
a pit fiend.

2017
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:06,316
TRAVIS: I take it. Can I put it in the pool of
blood?

2018
02:09:06,316 --> 02:09:10,364
MATT: Yeah. (sizzles)

2019
02:09:10,364 --> 02:09:12,066
TRAVIS: It dissolved it?

2020
02:09:12,066 --> 02:09:17,370
MATT: No, but the heat of it just naturally being
in the space, it steams as it goes in.

2021
02:09:17,370 --> 02:09:23,598
TRAVIS: That's a deep pool, you guys. Like
seriously, drowning warning, okay?

2022
02:09:23,598 --> 02:09:26,338
NOELLE: So wait, who are you guys again?

2023
02:09:26,338 --> 02:09:29,611
LAURA: I'm going to pop Trinket out of the
necklace and cast Cure Wounds on him.

2024
02:09:29,611 --> 02:09:31,638
NOELLE: Why are you here?

2025
02:09:31,638 --> 02:09:33,217
TRAVIS: Tax collectors.

2026
02:09:33,217 --> 02:09:41,476
TALIESIN: We were running-- let's just say, we had
a grudge and we took care of it.

2027
02:09:41,476 --> 02:09:43,650
NOELLE: All right, works for me.

2028
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:49,220
LIAM: What about you? Where are you from?

2029
02:09:49,220 --> 02:10:00,255
NOELLE: (sighs) I came here with friends. I don't
know if they're still alive, the ones-- well, most

2030
02:10:00,255 --> 02:10:10,469
of them are dead. I don't know if the other two
are still alive, but they're in prison. I've got

2031
02:10:10,469 --> 02:10:13,605
to rest up. I've got to get back and find them.

2032
02:10:13,605 --> 02:10:15,613
TRAVIS: Are they like you?

2033
02:10:15,613 --> 02:10:17,154
NOELLE: What do you mean, like me?

2034
02:10:17,154 --> 02:10:18,599
TRAVIS: I mean like (roars)?

2035
02:10:18,599 --> 02:10:20,255
NOELLE: Like bears? They're not bears.

2036
02:10:20,255 --> 02:10:21,239
TRAVIS: Oh.

2037
02:10:21,239 --> 02:10:23,253
LAURA: Wait, they're in the prison?

2038
02:10:23,253 --> 02:10:24,311
NOELLE: Yeah.

2039
02:10:24,311 --> 02:10:31,473
MARISHA: I Shapechange back to Keyleth for a
second. Do you know which section of the prison

2040
02:10:31,473 --> 02:10:32,737
they're in?

2041
02:10:32,737 --> 02:10:42,920
NOELLE: (sighs) I guess the same one I was in,
yeah? I know roughly. I was in the prison too.

2042
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:50,796
Utugash, he bought me. He was going to, I guess
corrupt my soul, or whatever, but good luck with

2043
02:10:50,796 --> 02:10:52,454
that, dude!

2044
02:10:52,454 --> 02:10:54,396
(laughter)

2045
02:10:54,396 --> 02:10:57,438
LAURA: Wait, does the Bastion of Flesh sound
familiar?

2046
02:10:57,438 --> 02:10:58,916
NOELLE: Does it?

2047
02:10:58,916 --> 02:11:02,674
MATT: You haven't heard the term. You weren't
given a lot of information. Most of your presence

2048
02:11:02,674 --> 02:11:07,481
once you were captured was just being dragged
through hallways, tortured, chained up and then

2049
02:11:07,481 --> 02:11:10,881
eventually purchased and brought here to be
perpetually tortured by Utugash until these guys

2050
02:11:10,881 --> 02:11:12,384
found you.

2051
02:11:12,384 --> 02:11:20,997
NOELLE: Honestly, I have no idea what's going on
still. It's been a hard time in hell. It doesn't

2052
02:11:20,997 --> 02:11:28,406
sound familiar, but I guess I know where my
friends might be. I've got to get back and see if

2053
02:11:28,406 --> 02:11:31,524
they're still alive, if they're still in there.

2054
02:11:31,524 --> 02:11:34,998
LAURA: As she's saying this, Trinket goes and
grabs some of the rotting meat out of one of those

2055
02:11:34,998 --> 02:11:38,103
and brings it to her as a present.

2056
02:11:38,103 --> 02:11:39,392
MARISHA: Aw.

2057
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:44,596
NOELLE: I accept it. Thanks, buddy.

2058
02:11:44,596 --> 02:11:48,720
MATT: And just gives you a big lick on the side of
the face.

2059
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,303
LAURA: Are you still a bear?

2060
02:11:50,303 --> 02:11:51,632
NOELLE: I'm a dwarf again.

2061
02:11:51,632 --> 02:11:52,731
MATT: No she's a dwarf.

2062
02:11:52,731 --> 02:11:55,838
TRAVIS: Oh, are you going to hand it over here
now? Thanks.

2063
02:11:55,838 --> 02:11:58,639
NOELLE: All yours. All yours, pal.

2064
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:00,386
TRAVIS: Is it really rotten?

2065
02:12:00,386 --> 02:12:04,095
MATT: It's on par with what you ate before.

2066
02:12:04,095 --> 02:12:07,596
LAURA: Would you know your way around if you went
back to the prison? I mean, do you think you'd

2067
02:12:07,596 --> 02:12:09,632
know your way through the halls?

2068
02:12:09,632 --> 02:12:16,726
NOELLE: I think so. I think I'd be able to-- with
my bear smell, I think I could find my way back at

2069
02:12:16,726 --> 02:12:21,091
least to where my friends were. Yeah, I can't
leave them in there: if they're still in there, I

2070
02:12:21,091 --> 02:12:29,277
have no idea, but I came here to help my friend,
he made a contract with a devil, and we came here

2071
02:12:29,277 --> 02:12:31,350
to try and get him out of it.

2072
02:12:31,350 --> 02:12:32,377
LAURA: Terrible idea.

2073
02:12:32,377 --> 02:12:33,472
TALIESIN: Always.

2074
02:12:33,472 --> 02:12:34,548
MARISHA: The worst idea you could ever do.

2075
02:12:34,548 --> 02:12:35,587
SAM: Well, we did that, no?

2076
02:12:35,587 --> 02:12:36,693
LAURA: No, I don't know what you're talking about,
Tary.

2077
02:12:36,693 --> 02:12:37,749
SAM: Yeah, Percy signed it.

2078
02:12:37,749 --> 02:12:38,973
TALIESIN: No we didn't.

2079
02:12:38,973 --> 02:12:44,088
NOELLE: Well, if you were thinking about doing it.
Don't. It's a bad idea.

2080
02:12:44,088 --> 02:12:46,874
LIAM: Since the little ones got away, do we want
to turn this into a walk-and-talk?

2081
02:12:46,874 --> 02:12:48,028
LAURA: Yeah, maybe we should get out of here.

2082
02:12:48,028 --> 02:12:52,389
MARISHA: Well, okay, hang on. What happens next?
Because aren't we supposed to be arrested next?

2083
02:12:52,389 --> 02:12:56,510
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we can check out the place until
they get here. Can we check the rest of the room

2084
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:57,933
first, before we leave?

2085
02:12:57,933 --> 02:12:58,927
MATT: Yeah, okay.

2086
02:12:58,927 --> 02:13:00,137
TRAVIS: Especially that back wall.

2087
02:13:00,137 --> 02:13:02,568
LAURA: But being very careful for traps because
they are present here.

2088
02:13:02,568 --> 02:13:04,648
TRAVIS: Not me, necessarily.

2089
02:13:04,707 --> 02:13:06,199
MATT: Oh, so Grog, you're taking point?

2090
02:13:06,199 --> 02:13:07,006
TRAVIS: Yep.

2091
02:13:07,006 --> 02:13:11,711
MATT: Okay. Grog, you enter this chamber, and it
opens up into this candelabra area. As you pass

2092
02:13:11,711 --> 02:13:14,525
this area, I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw, Grog.

2093
02:13:14,525 --> 02:13:19,688
TRAVIS: Okay. 15.

2094
02:13:19,688 --> 02:13:29,014
MATT: 15. You take a few steps and then on one of
the stone slabs beneath you, a glyph suddenly

2095
02:13:29,105 --> 02:13:35,030
brightly shines with a strange, pinkish-orange
glow, and then you guys watch as a column of

2096
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:39,872
somewhat translucent, ethereal energy shoots up,
engulfing Grog.

2097
02:13:39,872 --> 02:13:43,265
LAURA: What are you fucking doing?

2098
02:13:43,265 --> 02:13:44,612
TRAVIS: What?

2099
02:13:44,612 --> 02:13:48,276
MATT: You suffer 21 points of psychic damage.

2100
02:13:48,276 --> 02:13:52,163
TRAVIS: (yelps) I'm too smart again!

2101
02:13:52,163 --> 02:13:54,486
(laughter)

2102
02:13:54,486 --> 02:13:57,851
LIAM: I fly in alongside. You know, all you have
to do is ask. Will you hold still and give me ten

2103
02:13:57,851 --> 02:13:59,951
seconds? And I'll check the rest of the room, just
in case.

2104
02:13:59,951 --> 02:14:01,720
TALIESIN: Ew.

2105
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:03,458
LAURA: Ew, what is that?

2106
02:14:03,458 --> 02:14:06,300
MATT: This is another one of the boiling blood
chambers you saw earlier.

2107
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:10,940
LIAM: Okay. I'm just going to check for traps.

2108
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:14,943
TALIESIN: I like Crimson Peak as much as the next
person, but this is kind of over it.

2109
02:14:14,943 --> 02:14:16,445
LIAM: 30.

2110
02:14:16,445 --> 02:14:19,697
MATT: 30? Okay, as you scan the room, you do
notice on the inside of each one of these pillars

2111
02:14:19,697 --> 02:14:24,112
is another one of the similar platforms to the one
that Grog triggered, and the one that he triggered

2112
02:14:24,112 --> 02:14:26,691
here, there are about two, in width.

2113
02:14:26,691 --> 02:14:28,386
LIAM: There's spots on the ground?

2114
02:14:28,386 --> 02:14:32,090
MATT: Yeah, this whole area here, and this area,
and there's one here, and one here, and all these

2115
02:14:32,090 --> 02:14:33,228
can be triggered.

2116
02:14:33,228 --> 02:14:37,198
LIAM: All right, just hold on-- stay over there.
Do I see anything of value or anything else in the

2117
02:14:37,198 --> 02:14:38,857
room, besides the traps?

2118
02:14:38,857 --> 02:14:43,979
MATT: No, but what you do notice-- Vax, you and
Vex, and Keyleth, who have the highest passive

2119
02:14:43,979 --> 02:14:53,861
perception-- you hear from the ceiling above you,
what sounds like multiple entities

2120
02:14:53,861 --> 02:14:55,493
landing on the roof.

2121
02:14:55,493 --> 02:14:57,337
LIAM: All right, we've got to am-scray.

2122
02:14:57,337 --> 02:14:58,885
MARISHA: I think reinforcements are here.

2123
02:14:58,885 --> 02:15:01,335
LAURA: This is definitely what we talked about.

2124
02:15:01,335 --> 02:15:08,584
MARISHA: Did I see anything that looked like
guards that wore like the armor? The gold armor?

2125
02:15:08,584 --> 02:15:10,368
MATT: Not in the interior, no.

2126
02:15:10,368 --> 02:15:12,528
MARISHA: No, throughout the city.

2127
02:15:12,528 --> 02:15:14,773
MATT: From where you are right now?

2128
02:15:14,773 --> 02:15:16,970
MARISHA: Just in general, since I've been in
hell.

2129
02:15:16,970 --> 02:15:18,007
LAURA: Yeah, of course.

2130
02:15:18,007 --> 02:15:19,264
MARISHA: What are they?

2131
02:15:19,264 --> 02:15:22,983
MATT: You've seen the different types. You've seen
a couple that have been imps, you've seen a few

2132
02:15:22,983 --> 02:15:26,796
that have been winged humanoid entities.

2133
02:15:26,796 --> 02:15:32,399
MARISHA: Were there any like erinyeses or
succubuses that were also guards that would be one

2134
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:33,824
of these people?

2135
02:15:33,824 --> 02:15:36,828
MATT: You didn't see any of that, specifically.

2136
02:15:36,828 --> 02:15:38,514
TALIESIN: We're going to be okay. We were
expecting this.

2137
02:15:38,514 --> 02:15:42,646
MARISHA: I know, but I could still be a guard and
follow you guys there.

2138
02:15:42,646 --> 02:15:43,906
TALIESIN: Then what?

2139
02:15:43,906 --> 02:15:51,162
MARISHA: Then I'm someone on the outside and not
in prison as maybe a first responder.

2140
02:15:51,162 --> 02:15:53,402
LAURA: I don't know.

2141
02:15:53,402 --> 02:15:55,165
TRAVIS: I think you're overthinking this.

2142
02:15:55,165 --> 02:16:00,644
TALIESIN: It's a big prison. I think you're going
to be very far away from us very quickly.

2143
02:16:00,644 --> 02:16:04,965
MARISHA: If I say, hey, I found these guys, and I
walk with you guys all the way to the prison?

2144
02:16:04,965 --> 02:16:11,130
MATT: A hatch from the ceiling in this chamber in
here kicks open and about a dozen entities come

2145
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:16,739
dropping in, some winged, others like spined
similar bearded devils, some of them wearing the

2146
02:16:16,739 --> 02:16:21,592
golden armor of the Whisperers you've seen
throughout the city. It seems that the guard have

2147
02:16:21,592 --> 02:16:24,732
been called to the assault on this stronghold.

2148
02:16:24,732 --> 02:16:26,716
LAURA: I get Trinket back in the necklace really
fast.

2149
02:16:26,851 --> 02:16:28,641
MATT: Okay. Trinket's in the necklace. What's
everyone else doing?

2150
02:16:28,641 --> 02:16:36,033
MARISHA: Can I stealth? Can I turn into one of the
impish creatures in gold armor?

2151
02:16:36,033 --> 02:16:39,256
MATT: Sure. Yeah, okay. You turn into an imp.

2152
02:16:39,256 --> 02:16:40,517
MARISHA: Have they seen me yet?

2153
02:16:40,517 --> 02:16:44,299
MATT: You don't create equipment, so you would be
an imp. You'd have to put on gold armor.

2154
02:16:44,299 --> 02:16:46,212
MARISHA: I don't have the gold armor.

2155
02:16:46,212 --> 02:16:47,520
MATT: Yeah, so you'd just be an imp.

2156
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:51,525
MARISHA: Never mind. I'll just be myself for right
now.

2157
02:16:51,525 --> 02:16:55,302
MATT: Okay. So, you're remaining as Keyleth's
half-elf form. All right!

2158
02:16:55,302 --> 02:16:57,360
What's everyone else doing?

2159
02:16:57,360 --> 02:17:03,024
SAM: I drank a healing draught, and I am getting
my lance ready,

2160
02:17:03,024 --> 02:17:07,258
and I'm staying with fucking Doty.

2161
02:17:07,258 --> 02:17:09,682
LIAM: In which of these rooms did that trap door
open?

2162
02:17:09,682 --> 02:17:16,546
MATT: It opened here. Grog was waiting over to the
side. Grog, these entities landed near you, they

2163
02:17:16,546 --> 02:17:23,405
just kinda (rumbles), about a dozen of them just
swarm into the chamber near you. Vax, you're over

2164
02:17:23,405 --> 02:17:27,346
here on the side as you're figuring out the traps
in this area in the center. So they have been kind

2165
02:17:27,346 --> 02:17:28,951
of behind you in this area.

2166
02:17:28,951 --> 02:17:38,437
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to walk towards Grog. I'm
going to join him.

2167
02:17:38,437 --> 02:17:41,008
MATT: You join up with Grog here.

2168
02:17:41,008 --> 02:17:43,344
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself
really fast.

2169
02:17:43,344 --> 02:17:49,681
MATT: Okay, we'll say for the purposes of the
swarming of entities in this chamber.

2170
02:17:59,362 --> 02:18:04,263
MARISHA: Who's all been seen? That's a lot.

2171
02:18:04,263 --> 02:18:05,719
TRAVIS: We got Dis.

2172
02:18:05,719 --> 02:18:08,575
NOELLE: Are we all in there? Who's in there?

2173
02:18:08,575 --> 02:18:10,972
MATT: Are you guys all going to join? You're
staying with Doty?

2174
02:18:10,972 --> 02:18:12,242
SAM: I'm staying.

2175
02:18:12,242 --> 02:18:14,277
MATT: All right. Percival.

2176
02:18:14,277 --> 02:18:17,548
SAM: I'm going to try to see if I can try to start
fixing him.

2177
02:18:17,548 --> 02:18:22,009
MATT: Okay. You need workshop materials to do it.

2178
02:18:22,009 --> 02:18:24,689
SAM: Okay. Well, then I won't do that.

2179
02:18:24,689 --> 02:18:30,245
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit with Doty. I'm going to
stay in the room. I'm just going to be sitting on

2180
02:18:30,245 --> 02:18:31,562
Doty, probably.

2181
02:18:31,562 --> 02:18:32,680
MATT. Okay.

2182
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,179
MARISHA: Are those bone demony guys?

2183
02:18:34,179 --> 02:18:42,642
MATT: Bone demons, an erinyes enters, bearded
devils, cambions. A whole swarm comes in here.

2184
02:18:42,642 --> 02:18:45,088
MARISHA: I'll turn into one of the bone devils.

2185
02:18:45,088 --> 02:18:46,415
MATT: A chain devil lands.

2186
02:18:46,415 --> 02:18:48,014
MARISHA: I'll turn into a bone devil.

2187
02:18:48,014 --> 02:18:49,384
MATT: Okay. You turn into bone devil form.

2188
02:18:49,384 --> 02:18:51,522
LAURA: Why?

2189
02:18:51,522 --> 02:18:52,889
LIAM: Her game, man.

2190
02:18:52,889 --> 02:18:57,999
MATT: At this point, they swarm the room, they
have their weapons ready, they see you guys

2191
02:18:57,999 --> 02:19:03,565
standing there not making an aggressive maneuver.
The two bone devils that land within the chamber,

2192
02:19:03,565 --> 02:19:09,266
they seem to be wearing some sort of a sash that
has a torn bottom portion of it and some sort of

2193
02:19:09,266 --> 02:19:14,887
symbol that is holding it together over their
shoulder. Looks around.

2194
02:19:14,887 --> 02:19:21,401
"Do you resist or do you surrender?"

2195
02:19:21,401 --> 02:19:26,330
TRAVIS: I'm taking my cues from you, here.

2196
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:27,757
LAURA: (high-pitched) We surrender.

2197
02:19:27,757 --> 02:19:29,226
LIAM: We surrender, Grog.

2198
02:19:29,226 --> 02:19:31,710
TRAVIS: I can't say it. You've got say it.

2199
02:19:31,710 --> 02:19:40,642
LIAM: I surrender, and he's coming along.

2200
02:19:40,642 --> 02:19:48,380
MATT: "I will accept this as universal surrender."
Puts his arms up and you watch as a number of

2201
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:53,599
these individuals begin pulling heavy chain
manacles out from sacks and satchels. Two of them

2202
02:19:53,599 --> 02:19:59,791
immediately charge up and begin shackling Grog,
multiple layers of chain and manacles across your

2203
02:19:59,791 --> 02:20:07,553
arms and legs. They shackle you up and begin to
spread into the next room, coming to the rest of

2204
02:20:07,624 --> 02:20:15,697
you guys. They charge in and begin just, throat
manacle, to arms, to ankles, each with somewhat

2205
02:20:15,697 --> 02:20:20,901
slack chains and has a specific lead
chain attached to the center of the whole

2206
02:20:21,093 --> 02:20:27,813
ensemble. They go from person to person, they
throw them on you, though you angrily give in to

2207
02:20:27,887 --> 02:20:35,938
it. Keyleth, as you approach, one of them turns to
you and goes (speaks Infernal).

2208
02:20:35,938 --> 02:20:42,626
MARISHA: (speaks fake Infernal)

2209
02:20:42,626 --> 02:20:45,249
MATT: Make a deception check.

2210
02:20:45,249 --> 02:20:46,993
MARISHA: Fucking hell!

2211
02:20:46,993 --> 02:20:48,523
MATT: With disadvantage.

2212
02:20:48,523 --> 02:20:50,451
TRAVIS: You tried Parseltongue.

2213
02:20:50,451 --> 02:20:54,495
LIAM: Did you say you want to go to the disco with
me?

2214
02:20:54,495 --> 02:20:56,340
MARISHA: Eight. Total.

2215
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:58,146
NOELLE: I'm not a butt.

2216
02:20:58,146 --> 02:21:00,868
MATT: Leans in real close to you.

2217
02:21:00,868 --> 02:21:06,987
MARISHA: I give him a little bit of a twitch, like
maybe I'm the damaged bone devil.

2218
02:21:06,987 --> 02:21:14,428
MATT: "Liar!" The wings (angry fluttering noise)
behind it as it points its finger at you. A bunch

2219
02:21:14,428 --> 02:21:18,642
of the devils begin to swarm in from the sides
with the various polearms and jagged weapons

2220
02:21:18,642 --> 02:21:23,981
pointed in your direction. "Reveal thyself."

2221
02:21:23,981 --> 02:21:34,399
MARISHA: Oh god. Okay, I drop form.

2222
02:21:34,399 --> 02:21:42,878
MATT: "Shackle her. Twice over!" Of everyone, you
and Grog both get the Hannibal Lecter treatment.

2223
02:21:42,878 --> 02:21:49,893
As you're standing there with your spear out, they
all begin to swarm around you. Taryon?

2224
02:21:49,893 --> 02:21:53,826
TALIESIN: I say, oh no, whatever will we do. We
have this enormous piece of equipment that you

2225
02:21:53,826 --> 02:21:57,781
don't understand and could possibly be very
dangerous and probably should be locked up with

2226
02:21:57,968 --> 02:22:02,865
the rest of us. Oh no.

2227
02:22:02,865 --> 02:22:06,575
MATT: They don't seem to be paying any mind. They
throw the manacles on you. They subdue you very

2228
02:22:06,575 --> 02:22:10,200
quickly with a swift hit to the back of your
shoulders, your sense of bravado is immediately

2229
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:15,913
crumbled. They throw you to the ground and chain
you up. You are all then chained together and

2230
02:22:15,913 --> 02:22:24,040
brought to your feet as one of the bone devils
approaches. "You are found in the seeding stages

2231
02:22:24,096 --> 02:22:35,150
"of usurpation of a trusted of Dispater and are
sentenced to moral reassignment and delivery. You

2232
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:47,199
"are forfeit to Mentiri." Grabs the chains, tugs,
and you guys all begin to be pulled out and then

2233
02:22:47,199 --> 02:22:54,364
up through the hatch in this chamber, through
multitudes of devilish arms. They are pulling you

2234
02:22:54,364 --> 02:22:56,547
up through the ceiling.

2235
02:22:56,547 --> 02:23:00,391
LAURA: This is a good plan! Good plan!

2236
02:23:00,391 --> 02:23:03,677
TALIESIN: It's actually working better than I
expected.

2237
02:23:03,677 --> 02:23:07,399
MATT: You glance over your shoulder and watch as a
series of devils have now leapt onto Doty and are

2238
02:23:07,399 --> 02:23:09,714
pulling him apart.

2239
02:23:09,714 --> 02:23:14,732
LAURA: No! This is the part where C-3PO is being
pulled apart.

2240
02:23:14,732 --> 02:23:18,409
SAM: He served his purpose.

2241
02:23:18,587 --> 02:23:20,059
LAURA: No!

2242
02:23:20,059 --> 02:23:22,398
MATT: And that's where we're going to take a
break.

2243
02:23:22,398 --> 02:23:24,145
LIAM: He read you bedtime stories.

2244
02:23:24,145 --> 02:23:25,345
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2245
02:23:25,345 --> 02:23:29,267
MATT: Be back after a short break here. They're
going to show a few ads and then the Signal Boost

2246
02:23:29,267 --> 02:23:33,671
episode that Marisha just put out. We'll continue
our story here in just a few minutes, guys. See

2247
02:23:33,671 --> 02:23:34,665
you in a moment.

2248
02:23:34,665 --> 02:23:36,783
TRAVIS: Aw, Doty, poor bastard!

2249
02:23:36,783 --> 02:41:45,654
[break]

2250
02:41:45,707 --> 02:41:49,756
MATT: Welcome back. Hopefully the audio's better
for some folks. Thank you for being patient. We

2251
02:41:49,915 --> 02:41:56,748
have a winner in the Wyrmwood contest we had in
the chat room. AlchemistKiller wins this awesome

2252
02:41:56,748 --> 02:42:04,808
set of zebra wood dice box, dice tray, and the
dice roller. So congratulations to you, buddy.

2253
02:42:04,808 --> 02:42:07,952
This'll be coming your way soon, signed by the
cast of Critical Role.

2254
02:42:07,952 --> 02:42:09,159
LAURA: Killer!

2255
02:42:09,159 --> 02:42:19,852
MATT: Now. Diving back into where we were, folks.
You guys are yanked out onto the streets of the

2256
02:42:19,852 --> 02:42:25,615
Iron City of Dis, pulled off of the roof of
Utugash's personal stronghold and yanked across

2257
02:42:25,615 --> 02:42:31,477
the heated cobblestones, having to keep, through
what strength you have, standing, for fear of

2258
02:42:31,477 --> 02:42:38,777
being dragged across the extremely hot floor. As
you are brought through, people begin to gather up

2259
02:42:38,777 --> 02:42:45,615
on the sides of the street. You begin to see other
devils gathering towards the edges, and every ten

2260
02:42:45,615 --> 02:42:52,139
minutes of walking, when there's a crowd gathered
around, some of the devils will go ahead and crack

2261
02:42:52,139 --> 02:43:01,504
one of you in the back of the knee and give off a
showing of ownership and a general sense of cheer

2262
02:43:01,504 --> 02:43:07,426
emerges with each person that gets smacked in the
back of the head or thrust down. Percival, you

2263
02:43:07,426 --> 02:43:11,231
get, at one point, hit along the side of the jaw
and you feel the blood fill the side of your

2264
02:43:11,231 --> 02:43:15,058
mouth, as you wish you could rub it with your
hand, though the way the chains are pulling

2265
02:43:15,058 --> 02:43:20,188
prevent you from raising your arm too high. You
hear the hissing and the occasional rocks being

2266
02:43:20,188 --> 02:43:30,366
thrown from the distance as you're pulled through.
Vex and Vax, go ahead and roll

2267
02:43:30,366 --> 02:43:36,791
perception checks, please.

2268
02:43:36,791 --> 02:43:38,482
LIAM: 27.

2269
02:43:38,482 --> 02:43:40,154
LAURA: 31.

2270
02:43:40,154 --> 02:43:48,060
MATT: Okay. Vex, as this is happening and you
watch Percival recoil from the impact, you glance

2271
02:43:48,060 --> 02:43:54,965
with a bit of a sneer towards the crowd and you
watch amongst all these various toothy, hissing

2272
02:43:54,965 --> 02:44:03,668
devils, you see one familiar red-skinned man with
long-ish dark hair, horns curled up, and as his

2273
02:44:03,668 --> 02:44:12,545
eyes meet yours, he gives you a smile. And steps
back with the crowd as it closes around him.

2274
02:44:12,545 --> 02:44:16,176
LAURA: I breathe a little easier.

2275
02:44:16,176 --> 02:44:25,496
MATT: Bits of filth are being chucked. Grog, one--
not quite sure what form of refuse this is, but it

2276
02:44:25,496 --> 02:44:29,793
smears and drips down the side of your face, and
gets stuck in your beard.

2277
02:44:29,793 --> 02:44:31,007
(laughter)

2278
02:44:31,007 --> 02:44:31,989
LAURA: Gross.

2279
02:44:31,989 --> 02:44:33,033
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

2280
02:44:33,033 --> 02:44:35,588
TRAVIS: Okay. 17.

2281
02:44:35,588 --> 02:44:40,466
MATT: 17. You catch it in your mouth. And it is
filthy. You don't even know what it is. You regret

2282
02:44:40,466 --> 02:44:42,645
the impulse immediately.

2283
02:44:42,645 --> 02:44:44,988
TRAVIS: (spits)

2284
02:44:44,988 --> 02:44:52,975
MATT: This goes on for about 15 minutes as you
guys are pulled through. You watch as nearby

2285
02:44:52,975 --> 02:44:59,431
Whisperers begin to stop and perch on the edge of
buildings to watch. You get the sense that what

2286
02:44:59,431 --> 02:45:06,858
you guys have done has drawn some attention. As
you reach the end of this 15-minute period, you're

2287
02:45:06,858 --> 02:45:13,857
pulled down a large road and the buildings begin
to grow a little thin in this area. You're brought

2288
02:45:13,857 --> 02:45:23,011
to what looks to be a very, very heavy set of
doors, this crimson gate that is humongous: 20

2289
02:45:23,011 --> 02:45:28,079
feet by ten feet for each side of the gate, so 40
feet across. It leans at an angle, like a

2290
02:45:28,276 --> 02:45:36,271
gargantuan cellar door that sits on its own in the
center. As you begin to approach, you

2291
02:45:36,271 --> 02:45:44,385
hear chains suddenly (metal scraping). The doors
slowly open with a creaking noise as you're

2292
02:45:44,574 --> 02:45:51,115
brought towards it. They open, and you can see
inside it is lightless, it is dark. The two bone

2293
02:45:51,115 --> 02:45:56,184
devils tugging further, and with each tug, the
chains that connect you all choke and pull you

2294
02:45:56,184 --> 02:46:02,961
forward. You nearly stumble again as you're
brought over the stairway lip and down into this

2295
02:46:02,961 --> 02:46:05,748
darkened chamber below.

2296
02:46:05,748 --> 02:46:11,325
You are brought down a seemingly endless set of
stairs, the darkness only occasionally broken by

2297
02:46:11,325 --> 02:46:17,688
the passing faintly red-glowing sconce that passes
by as you're brought down. You hear the various

2298
02:46:17,688 --> 02:46:26,865
mutterings of various Infernal phrases being
spoken, chuckled between the devils that speak in

2299
02:46:26,865 --> 02:46:35,970
your vicinity. You then come to a leveling point.
The stairs come to an end, the light opening up in

2300
02:46:35,970 --> 02:46:41,241
this area; still dim, the reddish glow that
occasionally gives you a glimpse of the interior.

2301
02:46:41,241 --> 02:46:48,001
This, you can only imagine, would be what a prison
in hell looks like. The metal and stone walls are

2302
02:46:48,001 --> 02:46:55,621
warped and misshapen in places; they're almost
buckling under the weight of the plane they're

2303
02:46:55,621 --> 02:47:01,432
holding. You can see what looks to be stone arms
that are either carved out of the walls or have

2304
02:47:01,432 --> 02:47:08,323
been jammed into it as part of the decor. And you
see giant metal hooks that occasionally eject out

2305
02:47:08,323 --> 02:47:14,856
the side, some of them with the remains of some
sort of prisoner or meat that has been left to

2306
02:47:14,856 --> 02:47:20,494
slowly rot. More of those small devilish insects
you encountered when you first arrived

2307
02:47:20,643 --> 02:47:24,061
are gathering and feasting on these remnants.

2308
02:47:24,118 --> 02:47:36,412
You begin to hear various echoes of screams from
some distant place within this labyrinthine series

2309
02:47:36,412 --> 02:47:42,439
of hallways that have bounced through enough walls to the
point that it's this constant ringing gasp,

2310
02:47:42,617 --> 02:47:50,119
occasionally mixed with this high-pitched whine.
This wailing, and this sound of horrible torture.

2311
02:47:50,119 --> 02:47:57,569
It's very familiar to you, Tova. You have no idea
how long you were here before, but it seems

2312
02:47:57,569 --> 02:48:03,654
endless in hindsight. It could have been days,
weeks, months; you don't recall. The air itself is

2313
02:48:03,654 --> 02:48:12,662
extremely hot, stagnant, and humid with sweat and
has that subterranean putrescense to it. The idea

2314
02:48:12,662 --> 02:48:22,424
that mold and suffering pervade the atmosphere.
And, as you're carted through these hallways,

2315
02:48:22,424 --> 02:48:30,487
you're turned right, left, forward past multiple
intersections. More devils pass by. You see

2316
02:48:30,487 --> 02:48:36,442
another erinyes step by with three other minions
to her sides. She hisses as you walk past.

2317
02:48:36,442 --> 02:48:46,099
You are brought past so many different pathways
that it begins to all blend. You're trying to pay

2318
02:48:46,099 --> 02:48:50,478
attention to remember which way you came, but
sometimes the turns almost go so fast, it causes

2319
02:48:50,478 --> 02:48:55,655
you to lose track of where you originally started.
You get the essence that not only this is a

2320
02:48:55,655 --> 02:49:05,147
massive prison, but it's designed to keep
anyone from finding their way back out.

2321
02:49:05,386 --> 02:49:09,166
You turn one corner as you hear a series of very
high-intensity screams that cut through the

2322
02:49:09,166 --> 02:49:16,577
relative din in the background, and as you turn
you see three people: two humans and one male

2323
02:49:16,577 --> 02:49:22,820
half-elf that are naked and strung up by chains in
front of what looks like a large forge. You see

2324
02:49:22,820 --> 02:49:29,106
there a 12-foot-tall horned devil, his wings
folded up over his shoulders, these giant crested

2325
02:49:29,106 --> 02:49:34,791
horns off the front of his skull. Very Tim
Curry Legends-style, who's currently heating this

2326
02:49:34,845 --> 02:49:41,742
long brand in the forge as he's glaring at them.
And as you all walk past, his eyes catch yours

2327
02:49:41,806 --> 02:49:48,892
and he gives you a nod as he sears it in the body
of the half-elf, who begins to quiver and scream

2328
02:49:48,892 --> 02:49:56,302
against the chains. But he just gives you the rest
of the head nod as you pass, cross the door, not

2329
02:49:56,302 --> 02:49:59,738
seeing them any further.

2330
02:49:59,738 --> 02:50:03,558
SAM: I can't do this. I can't go in there.

2331
02:50:03,558 --> 02:50:09,378
MATT: You hear, as you leave past the doorway, you
hear a voice echo from the chamber you just

2332
02:50:09,378 --> 02:50:12,965
passed, "I'll see you soon enough."

2333
02:50:12,965 --> 02:50:15,716
LAURA: Great. Can't wait.

2334
02:50:15,716 --> 02:50:20,842
MATT: You're brought down another twisting series
of intersecting halls, the smell growing more and

2335
02:50:20,842 --> 02:50:28,191
more rancid the further in you go. You see three
chain devils wander past, these roving jailers

2336
02:50:28,191 --> 02:50:33,448
dragging broken bodies behind them in manacles
similar to yours. You see trails of blood

2337
02:50:33,448 --> 02:50:40,762
streaking across that are slowly turning dry and
thick with caked, drying blood, some bits turning

2338
02:50:40,762 --> 02:50:47,356
to mist across the hot stonework of the interior
of the prison. A twitch of one of the legs reveals

2339
02:50:47,356 --> 02:50:53,578
that these bodies are still living, though by but
an inch of their life. A few errant chains that

2340
02:50:53,578 --> 02:50:59,687
drift and drag behind them creepily caress the arm
and face of Taryon as you pass, just across your

2341
02:50:59,687 --> 02:51:03,195
cheek. One of them scratches you with 
a hook at the tip.

2342
02:51:03,268 --> 02:51:05,755
LAURA: You fall unconscious.

2343
02:51:05,755 --> 02:51:13,735
SAM: As we're walking, I'm going to whisper to
Percy. Are they going to take all our stuff?

2344
02:51:13,735 --> 02:51:16,345
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine.

2345
02:51:16,345 --> 02:51:18,283
SAM: I can't do anything without my stuff.

2346
02:51:18,283 --> 02:51:19,810
TALIESIN: We're going to be fine.

2347
02:51:19,810 --> 02:51:22,307
MATT: Your weapons have been gathered and they
have been taken from you.

2348
02:51:22,307 --> 02:51:26,095
SAM: Everything? Armor? Helmets?

2349
02:51:26,095 --> 02:51:31,414
MATT: You have your armor on you, still. Your
helmet is not currently on you, that's been taken

2350
02:51:31,414 --> 02:51:34,477
off. But your weapons have been taken from you
because you can't hold your weapons

2351
02:51:34,477 --> 02:51:35,796
in your chains.

2352
02:51:35,796 --> 02:51:37,181
LAURA: That's a break of contract.

2353
02:51:37,181 --> 02:51:38,328
TALIESIN: Not yet.

2354
02:51:38,328 --> 02:51:39,449
LAURA: All right.

2355
02:51:39,449 --> 02:51:45,355
MATT: So, further still, you're finally brought
within this 30 foot by 20 foot room, bisected by a

2356
02:51:45,355 --> 02:51:54,739
series of thick metal bars that open into a cell.
A single, towering chain devil sits within, larger

2357
02:51:54,739 --> 02:52:00,075
than any you've encountered. The broad shoulders
are almost as wide as Grog's, and the head is so

2358
02:52:00,075 --> 02:52:06,928
deeply set within the neck that it almost gives a
profile from shoulder to shoulder of a square. And

2359
02:52:06,928 --> 02:52:08,850
it cross-- Nice.

2360
02:52:08,850 --> 02:52:10,051
LAURA and TALIESIN: Nope.

2361
02:52:10,051 --> 02:52:11,831
MARISHA: Fuck this asshole.

2362
02:52:11,831 --> 02:52:17,579
MATT: The chains all begin to slacken as you enter
and the arms reach out almost in a graceful

2363
02:52:17,579 --> 02:52:26,696
invitation. You hear his horrible voice slither
out from the mask of black metal that covers

2364
02:52:26,696 --> 02:52:36,983
everything but his deep, red, burning, beady eyes.
"Good. String them up." As the devil entourage

2365
02:52:36,983 --> 02:52:41,474
that has pulled you through this prison brings you
into the cell one by one, they take your manacles

2366
02:52:41,474 --> 02:52:48,779
and latch them onto a thick, heavy, metal chain.
As they pull, it pulls your arms up over your body

2367
02:52:48,779 --> 02:52:57,795
and your leg manacles are attached to similar
rings on the ground. One by one, you are all

2368
02:52:57,795 --> 02:53:02,458
placed within this chamber, chained up, helpless.

2369
02:53:02,458 --> 02:53:07,315
SAM: This is the worst.

2370
02:53:07,315 --> 02:53:16,232
MATT: All the rest of the devils that brought you
in here exit the cell and leave through the

2371
02:53:16,232 --> 02:53:24,596
hallway, leaving the chain devil to do his duty.
He approaches the bars as he closes the

2372
02:53:24,596 --> 02:53:30,340
entranceway to the cell, so he's on the other side
of the cell from all of you. You're just strung up

2373
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:34,646
in there and he's pressed up against the bars from
the other side, his hands clutching as he stares

2374
02:53:34,646 --> 02:53:44,583
across you, his eyes slowly scanning. As he moves
his hands down the bars, the chains go limp and

2375
02:53:44,583 --> 02:53:51,170
unfurl around parts of his arms and begin to snake
and slither across the ground, a dozen of them or

2376
02:53:51,170 --> 02:53:58,926
so slowly creeping like tendrils of living
entities towards all of you as he says, "You seem

2377
02:53:58,926 --> 02:54:06,603
"weary. Let's loosen your load." As the chains
begin to snake their way up each of your bodies,

2378
02:54:06,603 --> 02:54:15,344
Grog, you feel one come up your torso and under
the gauntlets and begin to loosen the gauntlets on

2379
02:54:15,344 --> 02:54:19,675
your arm underneath. Vex, you feel as one curls
up, spirals around your leg and finds its way

2380
02:54:19,675 --> 02:54:25,104
under your armor, and eventually finds the buckles
in the back and begins to undo them. All of you

2381
02:54:25,104 --> 02:54:27,067
find the chains are all beginning to move--

2382
02:54:27,067 --> 02:54:28,410
LAURA: I saw this movie!

2383
02:54:28,410 --> 02:54:30,285
(laughter)

2384
02:54:30,285 --> 02:54:38,091
MATT: Beginning to infiltrate and remove the
various bits of equipment you all came into this

2385
02:54:38,091 --> 02:54:46,563
area on. A voice rings out from across the chamber
in the darkness. It goes, "Krix! You are needed by

2386
02:54:46,563 --> 02:54:54,830
"Overseer Shushot for prisoner enumeration and
status!" At which point, the chains stop and the

2387
02:54:54,830 --> 02:55:04,841
chain devil releases his fingers, tense against
the bars. The chains begin to slack and pull back

2388
02:55:04,841 --> 02:55:12,286
from your bodies and retract back into the
chamber. You now see behind him, stepping in, a

2389
02:55:12,286 --> 02:55:19,099
small green devil with long, knifelike ears, a
series of long spines across his body, similar,

2390
02:55:19,099 --> 02:55:26,890
though a thicker version, of the merchant that you
saw earlier on your journey here, this one

2391
02:55:26,890 --> 02:55:35,436
carrying the same sash that the bone devils that
originally arrived had adorned on their chest. It

2392
02:55:35,436 --> 02:55:40,982
does actually carry a satchel on one side. As the
jailer pulls the chains back to his body, he

2393
02:55:40,982 --> 02:55:46,261
snarls and turns back to this barbed devil, who
winces and recoils as soon as the chain devil

2394
02:55:46,261 --> 02:55:50,700
turns, already taking a submissive stance after
making his announcement in the chamber.

2395
02:55:50,700 --> 02:56:02,143
The chain devil, "I do despise such droll work."
Turns back to all the rest of you, "I will return,

2396
02:56:02,143 --> 02:56:11,264
"lovelies." The chains retract back into his body
and he walks out of the chamber past the barbed

2397
02:56:11,264 --> 02:56:17,221
devil, shoulder-checking it on the way through,
slips to the side. As it leaves, you're all still

2398
02:56:17,221 --> 02:56:19,272
there, chained up.

2399
02:56:19,272 --> 02:56:32,893
The green devil waits, rubbing its shoulder. Comes
forward, sheepishly, looking at all of you in

2400
02:56:32,893 --> 02:56:44,180
silence, breathing heavily, rubbing its chin.
Takes its satchel, and you can see it has this

2401
02:56:44,180 --> 02:56:48,742
hefty satchel on the side that's filled with a
series of side pockets and small openings, and it

2402
02:56:48,742 --> 02:56:53,011
begins to pry them open and it begins to produce
each one of your weapons, and is pulling them out

2403
02:56:53,011 --> 02:56:58,245
quickly and throwing them into a pile on the
outside of the bars. Pulls out your packs. The

2404
02:56:58,245 --> 02:57:01,312
various things that were taken from you have all
been put within this satchel and is quickly

2405
02:57:01,312 --> 02:57:06,029
throwing them into a pile on the other side of the
bars from all of you. Throws them all onto the

2406
02:57:06,029 --> 02:57:19,522
ground. Finishes in this big mass. "There.
Unspoiled. Unharmed. Now, to guide you." And the

2407
02:57:19,522 --> 02:57:24,597
creature walks up to the bars, and clutches the
sides staring at you. "You seek Hotis, yes?"

2408
02:57:24,597 --> 02:57:26,794
LIAM: Yes.

2409
02:57:26,794 --> 02:57:34,212
MATT: "He is under the ceiling of Iskath, though
Iskath is not in Mentiri this day. You must leave

2410
02:57:34,212 --> 02:57:44,986
"this room, turn right, left, straight, straight,
left, straight, then right. The iron door with the

2411
02:57:44,986 --> 02:57:54,045
"fanged grin bears the mark. There lies your
quarry. Now! My debt is paid! Goodbye." And the

2412
02:57:54,045 --> 02:57:57,851
devil turns around and begins to run out of the
chamber.

2413
02:57:57,851 --> 02:58:03,512
LAURA: Oh shit I missed the last thing that he
said. I got all the directions, but I didn't hear

2414
02:58:03,512 --> 02:58:05,348
the very last thing that he said.

2415
02:58:05,348 --> 02:58:06,453
LIAM: Door with a grin.

2416
02:58:06,453 --> 02:58:08,109
LAURA: Door with a grin?

2417
02:58:08,109 --> 02:58:10,159
MATT: Door with a fanged grin.

2418
02:58:10,159 --> 02:58:14,220
LIAM: Right, left, straight, straight, left,
straight, right.

2419
02:58:14,220 --> 02:58:17,071
LAURA: Wait I got right, left, straight, straight,
left, straight, right.

2420
02:58:17,071 --> 02:58:18,110
TRAVIS: That's what I've got, too.

2421
02:58:18,110 --> 02:58:20,599
MARISHA: Right, left, yeah, right, left, straight,
straight, right, left, straight?

2422
02:58:20,599 --> 02:58:21,528
LAURA AND LAURA: No.

2423
02:58:21,528 --> 02:58:23,297
LAURA: Right, left, straight, straight, left,
straight, right.

2424
02:58:23,297 --> 02:58:25,533
MARISHA: Right.

2425
02:58:25,533 --> 02:58:32,438
MATT: We'll find out. We'll find out who got the
right one. But the devil just leaves.

2426
02:58:32,438 --> 02:58:33,936
LAURA and LIAM: And we're still strung up?

2427
02:58:33,936 --> 02:58:35,162
MATT: You're all still strung up.

2428
02:58:35,162 --> 02:58:36,658
SAM: I didn't get my phone call!

2429
02:58:36,658 --> 02:58:38,245
LIAM: I'm going to start doing something.

2430
02:58:38,245 --> 02:58:40,377
LAURA: I want to try to lockpick, too.

2431
02:58:40,377 --> 02:58:45,357
MATT: Your lockpick was taken with your equipment--
unless you were hiding one,

2432
02:58:45,545 --> 02:58:46,633
you would have to specify.

2433
02:58:46,633 --> 02:58:54,942
LAURA: Not the one in my mouth. Okay, how about
this. I'm going to pop Trinket

2434
02:58:54,942 --> 02:58:56,179
out of the necklace--

2435
02:58:56,179 --> 02:58:58,089
SAM: Oh, wait, do we have the necklace?

2436
02:58:58,089 --> 02:58:59,711
TALIESIN: They wouldn't have taken it.

2437
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:04,131
MATT: The necklace was not taken off you. It was
just your satchels, equipment, and your armor.

2438
02:59:04,131 --> 02:59:07,366
LAURA: I grab the necklace and I go, Trinket, get
out.

2439
02:59:07,366 --> 02:59:11,106
MATT: Trinket emerges. (sneezes)

2440
02:59:11,106 --> 02:59:11,937
ALL: Bless you!

2441
02:59:11,937 --> 02:59:12,940
MATT: Thank you.

2442
02:59:12,940 --> 02:59:14,465
TRAVIS: Allergic to hell.

2443
02:59:14,465 --> 02:59:24,204
LAURA: Trinket! Get us out of here! Hey, okay,
here's the thing. Can you go over and get anything

2444
02:59:24,204 --> 02:59:27,290
out from between those two bars, on the outside of
the room?

2445
02:59:27,290 --> 02:59:32,969
MATT: Trinket goes over to the edge of the bars
and leans into them and is marking a claw across

2446
02:59:32,969 --> 02:59:36,970
the ground and it's about a good foot away from
the equipment and you can see that smoke

2447
02:59:36,970 --> 02:59:38,063
begin to rise

2448
02:59:38,063 --> 02:59:39,379
LAURA: Did you get that?!

2449
02:59:39,379 --> 02:59:44,034
LIAM: Yes! Dead for a ducat, it's dead!

2450
02:59:44,034 --> 02:59:47,613
(cheering)

2451
02:59:47,613 --> 02:59:48,814
MATT: Five experience to Sam Riegel.

2452
02:59:48,814 --> 02:59:52,003
TRAVIS: (laughs) Five experience.

2453
02:59:52,003 --> 02:59:58,709
MATT: You can see that the fur is beginning to
send off smoke smoke and burn against the bars as he's

2454
02:59:58,748 --> 03:00:00,522
leaning against them.

2455
03:00:00,522 --> 03:00:02,148
LAURA: Okay, back away.

2456
03:00:02,148 --> 03:00:04,902
Maybe you can try and just break through
these manacles. Can you do that?

2457
03:00:04,953 --> 03:00:10,786
MATT: Reaches up and grabs the one around your
ankle and tugs, and you see it begin to singe the

2458
03:00:10,786 --> 03:00:15,781
outside of his tongue. And he's pulling. Make a
strength check.

2459
03:00:15,781 --> 03:00:26,083
LAURA: Okay. Okay. Okay. 17?

2460
03:00:26,083 --> 03:00:32,775
MATT: 17. The chain on one of your ankles begins
to bend. It's not quite-- doesn't fully break. But

2461
03:00:32,775 --> 03:00:34,882
you can see that it's getting some headway.

2462
03:00:34,882 --> 03:00:37,982
LAURA: I want to pull my leg at the same time and
see if I can help him out at all.

2463
03:00:37,982 --> 03:00:40,138
MATT: Make a strength check as well.

2464
03:00:40,138 --> 03:00:48,993
LAURA: Should've had him do this to Grog. Okay.
(laughs) I suck at strength checks. Okay. 15.

2465
03:00:48,993 --> 03:00:56,472
MATT: 15? Okay. Between both Trinket and you
pulling, you do manage to get one of the chains to

2466
03:00:56,472 --> 03:00:59,535
(snapping sound), and you get one ankle free.

2467
03:00:59,535 --> 03:01:02,391
LAURA: Great, I have an ankle free. Hey, guys!
Guess what? My ankle's free.

2468
03:01:02,391 --> 03:01:03,566
NOELLE: Lucky.

2469
03:01:03,566 --> 03:01:06,111
LAURA: I am really flexible. This does nothing.

2470
03:01:06,111 --> 03:01:09,580
LIAM: Can you Druidcraft into my hand? Can you
give me a thorn, something long and thin?

2471
03:01:09,580 --> 03:01:11,513
LAURA: Yeah, Keyleth, what can you do?

2472
03:01:11,513 --> 03:01:15,305
MARISHA: I mean, I could probably also Beast Shape
out of this if I really wanted to.

2473
03:01:15,305 --> 03:01:16,415
LAURA: What the fuck, Keyleth?

2474
03:01:16,415 --> 03:01:17,420
LIAM: Do you really want to?

2475
03:01:17,420 --> 03:01:19,036
MARISHA: Well, you know, I was kinda waiting to
see what everybody else did.

2476
03:01:19,036 --> 03:01:20,923
TRAVIS AND TALIESIN: Less talking, more doing.

2477
03:01:20,923 --> 03:01:24,191
MARISHA: Okay. And I Beast Shape into a rat.

2478
03:01:24,191 --> 03:01:25,872
MATT: Okay.

2479
03:01:25,872 --> 03:01:28,775
LAURA: Can you do that to all of us?

2480
03:01:28,775 --> 03:01:34,771
MARISHA: Technically, yeah. And then I shape back
to Keyleth.

2481
03:01:34,771 --> 03:01:35,767
MATT: Okay.

2482
03:01:35,767 --> 03:01:38,570
SAM: She's amazing. Every time. Every time.

2483
03:01:38,570 --> 03:01:42,468
MARISHA: And then keys. Keys, right there on the
other side or something? Keys?

2484
03:01:42,468 --> 03:01:47,075
MATT: They're about maybe three and a half feet
from the edge of the bars.

2485
03:01:47,075 --> 03:01:52,241
MARISHA: I'm going to do a Thorn Whip. Thorn Whip
them to me.

2486
03:01:52,241 --> 03:01:55,217
MATT: To your equipment, you mean?

2487
03:01:55,217 --> 03:01:56,221
MARISHA: Wait.

2488
03:01:56,221 --> 03:01:58,954
MATT: Sorry. There's no keys to the door.

2489
03:01:58,954 --> 03:02:00,024
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

2490
03:02:00,024 --> 03:02:01,074
MATT: No, there's just a pile of--

2491
03:02:01,074 --> 03:02:03,640
LIAM: Get my lockpicks.

2492
03:02:03,640 --> 03:02:05,861
LAURA: Yeah, just get the lockpicks.

2493
03:02:05,861 --> 03:02:09,299
MARISHA: Which are in the satchel on the other
side of the bags, right?

2494
03:02:09,299 --> 03:02:15,339
MATT: So you Thorn Whip that over. You catch it.
You rummage through the pouch that he usually

2495
03:02:15,339 --> 03:02:18,597
keeps his equipment in. You find the lockpicks
that Vax usually uses.

2496
03:02:18,597 --> 03:02:19,559
MARISHA: I got it!

2497
03:02:19,559 --> 03:02:22,099
LIAM: Okay, bring it over here, love.

2498
03:02:22,099 --> 03:02:23,411
MARISHA: Okay.

2499
03:02:23,411 --> 03:02:25,466
LAURA: Do you have any extra? You can pass them to
me and I can maybe help.

2500
03:02:25,466 --> 03:02:26,463
LIAM: Already doing it while she's--

2501
03:02:26,463 --> 03:02:28,341
MARISHA: Are there any other extra lockpicks in
here?

2502
03:02:28,341 --> 03:02:29,568
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2503
03:02:29,568 --> 03:02:30,985
LIAM: Am I at disadvantage or anything
because I'm--

2504
03:02:31,060 --> 03:02:33,110
MATT: You are, because you're strung up.

2505
03:02:33,110 --> 03:02:35,463
MARISHA: Investigation check?

2506
03:02:35,463 --> 03:02:37,735
LIAM: 27.

2507
03:02:37,735 --> 03:02:39,678
MARISHA: Natural one.

2508
03:02:39,678 --> 03:02:41,736
MATT: You're rummaging through the bag, trying to
find it, you're like, I know it's in here

2509
03:02:41,736 --> 03:02:42,598
somewhere!

2510
03:02:42,598 --> 03:02:45,495
MARISHA: Honey, you're a hoarder. We really need
to clean out your purse.

2511
03:02:45,495 --> 03:02:47,953
LAURA: Just fucking let me out of this.

2512
03:02:47,953 --> 03:02:49,673
LIAM: Yeah, I start with my sister.

2513
03:02:49,673 --> 03:02:54,921
MATT: Yeah, you eventually get both of your arms
and ankles undone, you go up to your sister. She's

2514
03:02:54,921 --> 03:02:59,039
still looking through the pouch. Roll for Vax--
for Vex.

2515
03:02:59,039 --> 03:03:01,809
TRAVIS: Can I try and just muscle out this bitch,
since I'm still wearing my Gauntlets?

2516
03:03:01,809 --> 03:03:03,077
MATT: Make a strength check.

2517
03:03:03,077 --> 03:03:04,336
LIAM: 27 again.

2518
03:03:04,336 --> 03:03:06,069
MATT: You get her wrists undone.

2519
03:03:06,069 --> 03:03:07,633
LIAM: All right. I'll just hit the whole group,
then.

2520
03:03:07,633 --> 03:03:08,870
TRAVIS: 24.

2521
03:03:08,870 --> 03:03:10,107
MARISHA: I really can't find any--

2522
03:03:10,107 --> 03:03:15,495
MATT: Grog just pulls his manacles off the
ceiling. The chain (snapping sound). You break

2523
03:03:15,495 --> 03:03:16,539
them off your wrists.

2524
03:03:16,539 --> 03:03:19,561
LAURA: I want to go over and start trying to do
the lockpick. Oh, actually, I don't have any

2525
03:03:19,561 --> 03:03:21,031
lockpicks on me, still, do I?

2526
03:03:21,031 --> 03:03:22,201
MATT: No. It's across the way.

2527
03:03:22,201 --> 03:03:23,279
LIAM: I hand her a spare.

2528
03:03:23,279 --> 03:03:25,596
LAURA: Yeah, thanks. He gives me a spare and I
start trying to work on the door while he's doing

2529
03:03:25,596 --> 03:03:26,345
the others.

2530
03:03:26,345 --> 03:03:29,034
MATT: Okay, so you go over and grab a spare from
her pouch. You guys begin-- we'll say over the

2531
03:03:29,034 --> 03:03:33,059
next five minutes or so-- getting everyone undone
at this point. You pull-- you have the chains

2532
03:03:33,059 --> 03:03:36,857
still dangling from your wrists, the manacles
still attached to your Titanstone Gauntlets, but

2533
03:03:36,857 --> 03:03:37,912
you're free.

2534
03:03:37,912 --> 03:03:40,483
TRAVIS: I kinda maybe wrap them around, just for a
little super there.

2535
03:03:40,483 --> 03:03:42,391
MATT: Hell chains.

2536
03:03:42,391 --> 03:03:43,818
TRAVIS: Hell chains.

2537
03:03:43,818 --> 03:03:47,302
LIAM: As I get Tary out. We're going to be fine,
this is going to be fine.

2538
03:03:47,302 --> 03:03:48,458
SAM: We're in jail.

2539
03:03:48,458 --> 03:03:51,733
LIAM: I can see you shaking. It's going to be all
right. You're with us.

2540
03:03:51,733 --> 03:03:57,500
SAM: I have no Doty. Who will record my exploits
down here? Why am I here if not to

2541
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:59,861
record my adventures?

2542
03:03:59,861 --> 03:04:01,970
TRAVIS: You want me to write some stuff down for
you?

2543
03:04:01,970 --> 03:04:10,018
SAM: No. You're an idiot-- I mean, no thank you,
Grog. I lash out when I'm nervous and I don't have

2544
03:04:10,018 --> 03:04:11,567
my belongings.

2545
03:04:11,567 --> 03:04:13,780
LIAM: Do you know what to do with a knife?

2546
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:17,756
SAM: Of course. You cut your food before you eat
it.

2547
03:04:17,756 --> 03:04:23,720
LIAM: Okay. You also stick the sharp end of it
into things. And I take out the Flametongue, and I

2548
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:27,403
stick it in-- this is a loaner. I'll get it back
from you when we're done here.

2549
03:04:27,403 --> 03:04:30,725
SAM: I take out my rod and make it a dagger and
set it on fire.

2550
03:04:30,725 --> 03:04:32,207
LIAM: Oh, you have that.

2551
03:04:32,207 --> 03:04:33,191
SAM: Yes.

2552
03:04:33,191 --> 03:04:34,618
MATT: Well, you haven't picked up your equipment
yet.

2553
03:04:34,618 --> 03:04:37,047
SAM: Oh, I don't. I don't? Where is it?

2554
03:04:37,047 --> 03:04:38,547
TALIESIN: It's on the other side of the bars.

2555
03:04:38,547 --> 03:04:42,256
MATT: You're going to try and pick the bars that
lead into the next chamber?

2556
03:04:42,256 --> 03:04:44,846
LAURA: Out the doors, so I can get our shit.

2557
03:04:44,846 --> 03:04:48,436
MATT: Okay, so go for it.

2558
03:04:48,436 --> 03:04:50,048
LAURA: What do I add to it?

2559
03:04:50,048 --> 03:04:51,893
MATT: Add your proficiency bonus and your
dexterity.

2560
03:04:51,893 --> 03:04:55,870
SAM: Everything's outside? Shit. I need that
shit.

2561
03:04:55,870 --> 03:04:57,398
LAURA: 27?

2562
03:04:57,398 --> 03:05:06,304
MATT: 27? You get partway into it, and you feel
it's moving but it's a very, very difficult lock.

2563
03:05:06,304 --> 03:05:07,324
LAURA: Jesus.

2564
03:05:07,324 --> 03:05:08,435
TRAVIS: Can I try mine?

2565
03:05:08,435 --> 03:05:10,356
LAURA: Wait, not yet. It's quieter to do this.

2566
03:05:10,356 --> 03:05:11,705
LIAM: I rest my chin on her shoulder.

2567
03:05:11,705 --> 03:05:12,802
LAURA: Just, come over, and--

2568
03:05:12,802 --> 03:05:13,644
LIAM: Is it a sticky one?

2569
03:05:13,644 --> 03:05:16,008
LAURA: Yeah, it's really, really tough. I could
have done the chains on all of us, and you could

2570
03:05:16,008 --> 03:05:17,171
have done this, but whatever.

2571
03:05:17,171 --> 03:05:20,511
LIAM: All right. Rather than do it, I just grab a
hold of her elbow and I shift her to the side and

2572
03:05:20,511 --> 03:05:23,552
feel through her bones into the lock and--

2573
03:05:23,552 --> 03:05:24,726
MATT: Go for a roll.

2574
03:05:24,726 --> 03:05:26,228
SAM: Through her bones?

2575
03:05:26,228 --> 03:05:27,033
LIAM: Yeah.

2576
03:05:27,033 --> 03:05:28,065
LAURA: You're going through my bones.

2577
03:05:28,065 --> 03:05:28,831
LIAM: Yeah, man.

2578
03:05:28,831 --> 03:05:30,855
SAM: Tova, can't you just curse the lock?

2579
03:05:30,855 --> 03:05:32,465
LIAM: 27.

2580
03:05:32,465 --> 03:05:33,246
LAURA: Twins.

2581
03:05:33,246 --> 03:05:36,165
MATT: 27 again? You do so and the lock pick kind
of breaks off inside.

2582
03:05:36,165 --> 03:05:37,324
LIAM: Oh, it broke!

2583
03:05:37,324 --> 03:05:38,771
TRAVIS: Would anybody care if I try mine?

2584
03:05:38,771 --> 03:05:39,523
LAURA: Now you've got to.

2585
03:05:39,523 --> 03:05:40,893
TALIESIN: As long as we're free already--

2586
03:05:40,893 --> 03:05:42,498
LIAM: Could you "pick the lock," Grog?

2587
03:05:42,498 --> 03:05:43,490
MARISHA: Wait, who's stuck?

2588
03:05:43,490 --> 03:05:44,758
TRAVIS: Kame--

2589
03:05:44,758 --> 03:05:45,570
LAURA: But quiet.

2590
03:05:45,570 --> 03:05:46,666
TRAVIS: -- hame--

2591
03:05:46,666 --> 03:05:50,211
LAURA: Try to do it quietly. Just quiet. Just
quiet.

2592
03:05:50,211 --> 03:05:52,450
TRAVIS: -- what do you mean, quiet? I can't hold
it, it's so powerful, oh! (yells)

2593
03:05:52,450 --> 03:05:54,179
(laughter)

2594
03:05:54,179 --> 03:05:58,601
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

2595
03:05:58,601 --> 03:06:00,480
LAURA: Motherfucking door.

2596
03:06:00,480 --> 03:06:01,962
MARISHA: Fucking doors! It's always doors!

2597
03:06:01,962 --> 03:06:03,511
TALIESIN: Am I still chained down, by the way?

2598
03:06:03,511 --> 03:06:04,236
LIAM: No!

2599
03:06:04,236 --> 03:06:05,372
LAURA: No, no, no! He's been doing everybody.

2600
03:06:05,372 --> 03:06:06,250
TALIESIN: All right, that's fine.

2601
03:06:06,250 --> 03:06:07,676
TRAVIS: I guess it's not a-- what would I add, my
strength?

2602
03:06:07,676 --> 03:06:08,627
MATT: Yes.

2603
03:06:08,627 --> 03:06:09,914
SAM: I'm just rubbing my wrists.

2604
03:06:09,914 --> 03:06:12,329
TRAVIS: 26, so, 52?

2605
03:06:12,329 --> 03:06:13,498
MATT: It's your strength modifier.

2606
03:06:13,498 --> 03:06:17,321
TRAVIS: Which is eight, and I rolled a 18.

2607
03:06:17,321 --> 03:06:21,954
MATT: Right. That's 18 to see if you hit, so go
ahead and roll damage. For the purposes of this

2608
03:06:21,954 --> 03:06:24,432
roll, roll 1d4 and add your strength modifier.

2609
03:06:24,432 --> 03:06:26,988
TRAVIS: 1d4.

2610
03:06:26,988 --> 03:06:33,819
LAURA: That's a six, that's a 1d6. Hey! Great!

2611
03:06:33,819 --> 03:06:35,525
TRAVIS: Strength modifier, that's ten!

2612
03:06:35,525 --> 03:06:37,679
MATT: Ten. Double that, because Siege, so it's
20.

2613
03:06:37,679 --> 03:06:38,443
TRAVIS: 20.

2614
03:06:38,443 --> 03:06:42,884
MATT: So, with your one-fist punch, between the
damage you had done to the lock by messing with

2615
03:06:42,884 --> 03:06:49,697
it, and the impact of your fist, the lock
shatters, and the door squeaks open.

2616
03:06:49,697 --> 03:06:51,043
TRAVIS: You loosened it for me. Nice job.

2617
03:06:51,043 --> 03:06:53,269
LAURA: I reach through and try to grab everything
in, pass it out.

2618
03:06:53,269 --> 03:06:55,717
MATT: You pull the equipment in, you get your rod,
you get everything situated.

2619
03:06:55,717 --> 03:06:58,422
LAURA: Okay. I cast--

2620
03:06:58,422 --> 03:07:02,371
TALIESIN: Have we technically had a short rest
since we were basically just manacled walking for

2621
03:07:02,371 --> 03:07:03,015
a while?

2622
03:07:03,015 --> 03:07:03,863
MATT: Nope!

2623
03:07:03,863 --> 03:07:04,931
TALIESIN: Okay, just checking.

2624
03:07:04,931 --> 03:07:06,207
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

2625
03:07:06,207 --> 03:07:07,817
TRAVIS: Ooh, good call--

2626
03:07:07,817 --> 03:07:10,059
MARISHA: Do we want to take a short rest while
we're supposedly--

2627
03:07:10,059 --> 03:07:10,648
TRAVIS: Nope!

2628
03:07:10,648 --> 03:07:11,276
LAURA: Nope!

2629
03:07:11,276 --> 03:07:12,163
TALIESIN: Nope, nope, let's just--

2630
03:07:12,163 --> 03:07:12,961
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

2631
03:07:12,961 --> 03:07:16,933
LAURA: I think it would be best if maybe we, I
mean, I don't know how well we can stealth around

2632
03:07:16,933 --> 03:07:20,390
here, if we should maybe turn into insects and
just crawl around here.

2633
03:07:20,390 --> 03:07:22,876
MARISHA: I can do that to us.

2634
03:07:22,876 --> 03:07:23,981
LAURA: I think we should do that.

2635
03:07:23,981 --> 03:07:25,895
MARISHA: Is everyone cool with that?

2636
03:07:25,895 --> 03:07:28,258
LAURA: But I've definitely got a Pass Without a
Trace still on us.

2637
03:07:28,258 --> 03:07:30,333
TALIESIN: Can we still Plane Shift later?

2638
03:07:30,333 --> 03:07:36,294
MARISHA: I can still Plane Shift us, so I can burn
one of my higher-level spells-- like an eight on

2639
03:07:36,294 --> 03:07:43,152
the scale of zero to nine-- and be animals, and
then I can save my seventh-level for Plane Shift

2640
03:07:43,152 --> 03:07:44,452
in case of emergency.

2641
03:07:44,452 --> 03:07:45,149
TALIESIN: Okay.

2642
03:07:45,149 --> 03:07:46,315
LAURA: Solid. Copy on that.

2643
03:07:46,315 --> 03:07:49,045
TRAVIS: Wait a minute, but doesn't the floor burn?
Are we going to flip out of that shape real fast?

2644
03:07:49,045 --> 03:07:50,143
NOELLE: The floor does burn.

2645
03:07:50,143 --> 03:07:51,851
LAURA: But maybe those little insects are immune
to the fire since they live here.

2646
03:07:51,851 --> 03:07:53,267
TRAVIS: But we're animals though, we're not
insects. We're animals.

2647
03:07:53,267 --> 03:07:54,496
LAURA: Wait, we can't be those little--

2648
03:07:54,496 --> 03:07:55,229
TRAVIS: No.

2649
03:07:55,229 --> 03:07:56,449
LIAM: Can't we fly? Can't we be flying?

2650
03:07:56,449 --> 03:07:58,296
MARISHA: Can I not do that with Animal Shapes? I
can't turn into the insects?

2651
03:07:58,296 --> 03:07:59,661
MATT: Animal Shapes? You can only do beasts.

2652
03:07:59,661 --> 03:08:01,140
TRAVIS: Yeah, I remember we had this conversation
before.

2653
03:08:01,140 --> 03:08:02,740
SAM: Well, why don't we be pigeons that can
fucking fly?

2654
03:08:02,740 --> 03:08:07,444
MATT: And the creatures that you saw, the insects
here, are technically very, very small fiends.

2655
03:08:07,444 --> 03:08:08,436
MARISHA: Hm.

2656
03:08:08,436 --> 03:08:09,809
LAURA: Oh, really?

2657
03:08:09,809 --> 03:08:11,252
LIAM: But we could be hornets, or flies?

2658
03:08:11,252 --> 03:08:13,980
MARISHA: Have I seen anything, like flies or rats
or anything like that?

2659
03:08:13,980 --> 03:08:14,799
TRAVIS: Not insects.

2660
03:08:14,799 --> 03:08:15,550
LAURA: Not insects.

2661
03:08:15,550 --> 03:08:16,834
MATT: You've seen rats, but they don't do well
here because of the heat.

2662
03:08:16,834 --> 03:08:17,925
LIAM: There's flies all over this shit.

2663
03:08:17,925 --> 03:08:19,368
LAURA: Maybe hummingbirds, something, the
teensiest bird you can think of.

2664
03:08:19,368 --> 03:08:20,680
LIAM: We're not in the woods though. Flies.

2665
03:08:20,680 --> 03:08:22,782
MARISHA: Hang on, I've seen rats, and I've seen
what? Have I seen any--

2666
03:08:22,782 --> 03:08:24,261
LAURA: We can't be insects, we can only be
animals.

2667
03:08:24,261 --> 03:08:25,686
MARISHA: I've got to be beasts.

2668
03:08:25,686 --> 03:08:27,982
LAURA: Yeah, so teeny teeny teeny, like, finches
or hummingbirds.

2669
03:08:27,982 --> 03:08:31,249
MARISHA: Are there anything like bats? Have I ever
seen any bats?

2670
03:08:31,249 --> 03:08:32,243
LAURA: Ooh, bats, down here?

2671
03:08:32,243 --> 03:08:35,199
MATT: You've seen bats before, you haven't seen
bats that reside in this domain.

2672
03:08:35,199 --> 03:08:39,389
LAURA: Whatever, as long as we're flying, maybe we
can be stealthy. We'll be stealhty bats.

2673
03:08:39,389 --> 03:08:43,311
TRAVIS: What happens if we hit a door on this
right-left-straight-straight-left-straight-right?

2674
03:08:43,311 --> 03:08:45,358
SAM: Let's just walk.

2675
03:08:45,358 --> 03:08:50,382
MARISHA: I mean, technically, with Animal Shapes,
I can change us with an action. Correct?

2676
03:08:50,382 --> 03:08:52,362
MATT: That's true. I think so, yeah.

2677
03:08:52,362 --> 03:08:54,997
LAURA: So we can just shift in and out whenever we
want? With an action?

2678
03:08:54,997 --> 03:08:56,752
MARISHA: Yeah, as long as we don't get caught.

2679
03:08:56,752 --> 03:08:58,027
TRAVIS: I don't mind starting out that way.

2680
03:08:58,027 --> 03:08:58,950
LIAM: All right.

2681
03:08:58,950 --> 03:09:01,837
LAURA: Okay, I think getting-- yeah, we should,
it's easier to not get caught. And then we'll stealth

2682
03:09:01,837 --> 03:09:03,242
as bats.

2683
03:09:03,310 --> 03:09:04,306
TALIESIN: Stealthy bats.

2684
03:09:04,306 --> 03:09:05,882
MARISHA: All right. So we're starting as bats.
Bats?

2685
03:09:05,882 --> 03:09:06,764
LAURA: Sure.

2686
03:09:06,764 --> 03:09:08,259
TRAVIS: What do our bats sound like?

2687
03:09:08,259 --> 03:09:09,633
LIAM: "Where is Harvey Dent?"

2688
03:09:09,633 --> 03:09:11,421
(high-pitched squealing)

2689
03:09:11,421 --> 03:09:14,322
MATT: Okay. This is concentration, so this will
get rid of your Shapechange.

2690
03:09:14,322 --> 03:09:21,643
MARISHA: Correct. So as long as we're cool with me
losing my ninth-level Shapechange. I can't escort

2691
03:09:21,713 --> 03:09:24,129
us as an erinyes anymore.

2692
03:09:24,129 --> 03:09:27,006
SAM: I think we should just walk, but if you want
to do this, you can.

2693
03:09:27,006 --> 03:09:28,945
TRAVIS: Ooh, wait! Well--

2694
03:09:28,945 --> 03:09:31,607
LAURA: I think we'll just-- there's a lot of
demons around here. Devils.

2695
03:09:31,607 --> 03:09:34,083
MARISHA: How much longer is my Shapechange left?
It lasts for an hour.

2696
03:09:34,083 --> 03:09:35,512
TRAVIS: You don't speak that shit, is the
problem.

2697
03:09:35,512 --> 03:09:37,578
MATT: You're not quite certain, but it's pushing
close to an hour.

2698
03:09:37,578 --> 03:09:39,829
LAURA: Yeah, you don't speak the shit, so even if
you have it--

2699
03:09:39,829 --> 03:09:42,472
MARISHA: I don't speak the shit. So, bats!

2700
03:09:42,472 --> 03:09:50,236
LAURA: Stealthy bats. We fly close to the ceiling and
be as quiet as possible.

2701
03:09:50,236 --> 03:09:51,464
NOELLE: I don't care for this.

2702
03:09:51,464 --> 03:09:53,500
TRAVIS: I know it's not a bear, but at least they
both start with a... D.

2703
03:09:53,500 --> 03:09:54,505
NOELLE: Bears, bats--

2704
03:09:54,505 --> 03:09:56,524
MATT: All of you guys turn into bats, flapping.

2705
03:09:56,524 --> 03:10:00,324
MARISHA: Wait, I can technically make some of us
bats and some of us other things, correct?

2706
03:10:00,324 --> 03:10:02,025
I can choose.

2707
03:10:02,025 --> 03:10:03,050
MATT: Yup.

2708
03:10:03,050 --> 03:10:05,286
MARISHA: Does anyone not want to be a bat for any
particular reason?

2709
03:10:05,286 --> 03:10:09,518
LAURA: I'm solid with the bat, but I'm going to
lead the way since I'm good with directions.

2710
03:10:09,518 --> 03:10:11,529
SAM: Since bats can't see, maybe we should--

2711
03:10:11,529 --> 03:10:12,577
TALIESIN: They can see!

2712
03:10:12,577 --> 03:10:13,894
TRAVIS: Take off, I'll follow you.

2713
03:10:13,894 --> 03:10:15,529
MATT: Essentially, you get--

2714
03:10:15,529 --> 03:10:18,385
MARISHA: Sonar.

2715
03:10:18,385 --> 03:10:20,899
LAURA: Oh, but we can still see where we're
going.

2716
03:10:20,899 --> 03:10:22,639
MATT: Yeah. The equivalent of Darkvision. You know
where you're going.

2717
03:10:22,639 --> 03:10:23,702
MARISHA: Echolocation.

2718
03:10:23,702 --> 03:10:26,423
LAURA: Is it echolocation only?

2719
03:10:26,423 --> 03:10:29,522
TALIESIN: No, they have both. I mean,
biologically, they have both.

2720
03:10:29,522 --> 03:10:30,529
MARISHA: We have Darkvision.

2721
03:10:30,529 --> 03:10:31,252
LAURA: Okay.

2722
03:10:31,252 --> 03:10:32,311
TRAVIS: I'm following Vex out.

2723
03:10:32,311 --> 03:10:33,219
TALIESIN: Yup.

2724
03:10:33,219 --> 03:10:35,577
MARISHA: Bats go in swarms. We're all bats.

2725
03:10:35,577 --> 03:10:40,207
MATT: All right, so a bat swarm suddenly emerges
into the hallway, which immediately turns right

2726
03:10:40,207 --> 03:10:41,667
and left. Which direction do you go?

2727
03:10:41,667 --> 03:10:42,583
LAURA: Right.

2728
03:10:42,583 --> 03:10:46,742
MATT: Okay, you turn right, and as you guys rush
into the corner, you watch as the chain devil that

2729
03:10:46,742 --> 03:10:48,060
originally arrived in the first chamber--

2730
03:10:48,060 --> 03:10:49,418
LAURA: Flying close to the ceiling, stealthy.

2731
03:10:49,418 --> 03:10:50,531
SAM: Stealthy.

2732
03:10:50,531 --> 03:10:53,697
MATT: Right. It's about 15 feet up to the ceiling,
and you guys come up. The chain devil walks

2733
03:10:53,776 --> 03:11:00,094
beneath, and as you guys arc past him, he kind of
stops and looks over and watches you all go past

2734
03:11:00,094 --> 03:11:02,794
him and he keeps walking, looking very confused.

2735
03:11:02,794 --> 03:11:05,768
LIAM: Fly with purpose, fly with purpose.

2736
03:11:05,768 --> 03:11:08,196
LAURA: Okay. Fly with purpose, fly with purpose.

2737
03:11:08,196 --> 03:11:10,114
MATT: All right. So you guys continue.

2738
03:11:10,114 --> 03:11:11,977
LAURA: As soon as we get to a thing, we turn
left.

2739
03:11:11,977 --> 03:11:19,253
MATT: Yes. So you go forward for about 60, 70 feet
or so. You see a couple of small imps also fly

2740
03:11:19,253 --> 03:11:24,560
past, and you guys kind of dart around, and they
all look curiously at these bats that are swarming

2741
03:11:24,560 --> 03:11:25,797
past them.

2742
03:11:25,797 --> 03:11:26,975
MARISHA: This is the best.

2743
03:11:26,975 --> 03:11:28,083
LAURA: At least they're letting us go right now.

2744
03:11:28,083 --> 03:11:29,021
TALIESIN: Everything's fine.

2745
03:11:29,021 --> 03:11:30,759
MATT: You come to a T intersection now.

2746
03:11:30,759 --> 03:11:31,642
LAURA: Left. Oh!

2747
03:11:31,642 --> 03:11:32,397
TRAVIS: Straight.

2748
03:11:32,397 --> 03:11:33,102
LIAM: Straight.

2749
03:11:33,102 --> 03:11:34,202
SAM: Wait, do we go right? What?

2750
03:11:34,202 --> 03:11:35,068
LAURA: Wait, no, we haven't gone left yet.

2751
03:11:35,068 --> 03:11:35,909
LIAM: We didn't take a left yet?

2752
03:11:35,909 --> 03:11:36,489
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2753
03:11:36,489 --> 03:11:37,252
LIAM: I thought we were taking it.

2754
03:11:37,252 --> 03:11:38,083
MATT: You turned right.

2755
03:11:38,083 --> 03:11:39,152
LAURA: Yes, and now we're going to turn left.

2756
03:11:39,152 --> 03:11:46,241
MATT: And then you turn left. All right. You all
shift, following Vex's pathway, left. And as you

2757
03:11:46,241 --> 03:11:51,650
go forward in that direction, you watch as another
chain devil and two barbed devils, similar to the

2758
03:11:51,650 --> 03:11:57,434
one that came in there and brought your equipment,
are patrolling down the hall. As you guys are

2759
03:11:57,434 --> 03:12:00,235
approaching, I want everyone to roll a stealth
check.

2760
03:12:00,235 --> 03:12:01,177
LIAM: Yeah. Plus ten.

2761
03:12:01,177 --> 03:12:01,953
LAURA: Plus ten!

2762
03:12:01,953 --> 03:12:02,945
MARISHA: Plus ten.

2763
03:12:02,945 --> 03:12:10,610
LAURA: I'm going to say Trinket's back in the
necklace, by the way.

2764
03:12:10,610 --> 03:12:11,453
MATT: I assumed.

2765
03:12:11,453 --> 03:12:13,064
LAURA: Okay.

2766
03:12:13,064 --> 03:12:15,491
NOELLE: So that plus ten for them, that was their
Feast?

2767
03:12:15,491 --> 03:12:17,225
LAURA: No, that was me, I did that.

2768
03:12:17,225 --> 03:12:18,124
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

2769
03:12:18,124 --> 03:12:19,752
MATT: Spell she cast she cast on everybody, so
everyone gets plus ten dice.

2770
03:12:19,752 --> 03:12:20,699
NOELLE: Oh, okay! Cool! Cool.

2771
03:12:20,699 --> 03:12:21,710
SAM: 17.

2772
03:12:21,710 --> 03:12:22,405
TALIESIN: 35.

2773
03:12:22,405 --> 03:12:23,365
MARISHA: 26.

2774
03:12:23,365 --> 03:12:24,238
LIAM: 37.

2775
03:12:24,238 --> 03:12:25,251
NOELLE: 15.

2776
03:12:25,251 --> 03:12:26,015
LAURA: 34.

2777
03:12:26,015 --> 03:12:27,135
TRAVIS: 25.

2778
03:12:27,135 --> 03:12:38,638
MATT: Okay. As you guys (fluttering noises) past,
the barbed devils just keep walking forward. The

2779
03:12:38,638 --> 03:12:41,349
chain devil stops and turns and looks over and
sees you all.

2780
03:12:41,349 --> 03:12:43,651
LAURA: Just keep flying!

2781
03:12:43,651 --> 03:12:46,925
MATT: And turns and starts walking in your
direction as you guys keep flying. You come to a

2782
03:12:46,925 --> 03:12:49,061
gate that is closed.

2783
03:12:49,061 --> 03:12:50,264
TALIESIN: A gate!

2784
03:12:50,264 --> 03:12:51,411
LIAM: Solid, or bars?

2785
03:12:51,411 --> 03:12:56,563
MATT: It's solid, there is a small opening with
some bars that are about that far apart each.

2786
03:12:56,563 --> 03:12:57,680
LAURA: Let's go through them.

2787
03:12:57,680 --> 03:12:58,636
TALIESIN: We can go through.

2788
03:12:58,636 --> 03:13:00,708
MATT: You guys as bats press through the gate,
just as--

2789
03:13:00,708 --> 03:13:02,898
LAURA: Avoiding the bars! Avoiding the bars.

2790
03:13:02,898 --> 03:13:07,300
MATT: -- just as the chain devil runs up to try
and grab at you as you guys charge through, his

2791
03:13:07,300 --> 03:13:15,041
arms catching the gate, and you hear him start
yelling, and suddenly you start hearing in the

2792
03:13:15,224 --> 03:13:21,798
distance, behind where you were, sounds like rapid
footprints, footfalls. Apparently, people are now

2793
03:13:21,798 --> 03:13:24,153
aware that you have escaped your cell.

2794
03:13:24,153 --> 03:13:25,137
LAURA: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

2795
03:13:25,137 --> 03:13:25,925
NOELLE: Fuck.

2796
03:13:25,925 --> 03:13:26,951
SAM: I'm Batman.

2797
03:13:26,951 --> 03:13:28,259
MATT: So. You guys continue rushing forward.

2798
03:13:28,259 --> 03:13:29,940
MARISHA: We can always be rats whenever the time
is necessary!

2799
03:13:29,940 --> 03:13:31,297
TRAVIS: No, no, we'll burn out of it. We'll burn
out of it.

2800
03:13:31,297 --> 03:13:32,894
LAURA: Let's just keep going.

2801
03:13:32,894 --> 03:13:33,696
MARISHA: Keep going.

2802
03:13:33,696 --> 03:13:36,085
MATT: You guys come to another T section.

2803
03:13:36,085 --> 03:13:37,224
LAURA: Straight!

2804
03:13:37,224 --> 03:13:41,167
MATT: You go straight on this one? All right. You
go straight past. Beneath you, you can see there's

2805
03:13:41,167 --> 03:13:45,084
another one of those blood pools that was in
Utugash's chamber, and there are a couple of

2806
03:13:45,084 --> 03:13:49,562
grates on each side. You can see the grates are
corroded with the quick glances as you go past. As

2807
03:13:49,562 --> 03:13:53,252
you continue straight forward, you hear more
screams from the right and left side, the two

2808
03:13:53,252 --> 03:13:58,660
hallways that you pass, just kind of (screaming)
echoing past, and you just keep pushing forward as

2809
03:13:58,841 --> 03:14:04,366
best as you can. You hear the gate in the distance
open, so now you know, whoever was giving chase,

2810
03:14:04,366 --> 03:14:10,963
they're now starting to pick up behind you. You
come up to what looks to be a right and left.

2811
03:14:10,963 --> 03:14:12,903
SAM: Wait, what?

2812
03:14:12,903 --> 03:14:16,258
LAURA: Wait, only a right and left? But we have
two straights in a row!

2813
03:14:16,258 --> 03:14:17,914
SAM: We go straight!

2814
03:14:17,914 --> 03:14:20,542
LIAM: Yeah. Is there any hidden door here? Search
for a hidden door.

2815
03:14:20,542 --> 03:14:21,745
SAM: We go straight into the wall!

2816
03:14:21,745 --> 03:14:23,113
LIAM: I'm searching for a door, as a bat.

2817
03:14:23,113 --> 03:14:24,197
TALIESIN: Straight, in the door, keep going
straight.

2818
03:14:24,197 --> 03:14:25,395
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2819
03:14:25,395 --> 03:14:26,321
MARISHA: Come on, come on! Come on!

2820
03:14:26,321 --> 03:14:28,114
LAURA: Keep going straight.

2821
03:14:28,114 --> 03:14:29,441
LIAM: 18.

2822
03:14:29,441 --> 03:14:33,296
MATT: 18? You briefly glance forward as you guys
sit here for a second, and you begin to hear the

2823
03:14:33,296 --> 03:14:40,057
distant sound of various Infernal yells getting
louder and louder. Something about the wall right

2824
03:14:40,057 --> 03:14:42,213
in front of you doesn't look right.

2825
03:14:42,213 --> 03:14:43,525
LAURA: Keep going straight!

2826
03:14:43,525 --> 03:14:50,804
LIAM: I start battering into the door.

2827
03:14:50,804 --> 03:14:52,776
LAURA: Can we batter into it, or can we just fly
straight through?

2828
03:14:52,776 --> 03:14:55,042
MATT: Vax just passes straight through. It's an
illusory wall.

2829
03:14:55,042 --> 03:14:57,016
(yelling)

2830
03:14:57,016 --> 03:14:59,247
MATT: As you guys (flapping noise) into this next
chamber--

2831
03:14:59,247 --> 03:15:00,814
LIAM: Everybody's doing something different.

2832
03:15:00,814 --> 03:15:01,468
MATT: Yeah.

2833
03:15:01,468 --> 03:15:03,520
NOELLE: It's like, 'fuck, okay'.

2834
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:05,052
MATT: Tova's so confused--

2835
03:15:05,052 --> 03:15:07,127
NOELLE: This has been a weird day.

2836
03:15:07,127 --> 03:15:08,767
LIAM: Aren't you glad you're playing with us?

2837
03:15:08,767 --> 03:15:11,226
LAURA: Tary's got wings coming out of his head.

2838
03:15:11,226 --> 03:15:16,798
MATT: As you guys are flying, in this new chamber
it is pitch black. Thankfully, your vision allows

2839
03:15:16,798 --> 03:15:20,818
you as best to see. Tova, you start having the
recurring memory of the fact that you're not sure

2840
03:15:20,818 --> 03:15:24,354
where they're going, where they're taking you, but
you still have people in this prison.

2841
03:15:24,354 --> 03:15:27,626
NOELLE: Yeah. Am I looking out? Do I recognize
anything that we're passing?

2842
03:15:27,626 --> 03:15:30,543
MATT: You have no idea where they are and you have
no idea where you are currently.

2843
03:15:30,543 --> 03:15:37,222
NOELLE: Can I use my heightened senses to do a
perception check and see if I can smell anything?

2844
03:15:37,222 --> 03:15:39,574
MATT: You would if you weren't a bat.

2845
03:15:39,574 --> 03:15:42,728
NOELLE: I mean, there's nothing in the rule book
that says bats can't have heightened senses.

2846
03:15:42,728 --> 03:15:45,424
MARISHA: Hang on. Well, technically, what do bats
have?

2847
03:15:45,424 --> 03:15:47,735
TRAVIS: Not a great sense of smell. That's for
sure.

2848
03:15:47,735 --> 03:15:50,101
NOELLE: I don't need to be a bear to do that. It
says that's just part of my class.

2849
03:15:50,101 --> 03:15:52,540
MATT: I know, I know. When you're in your normal
form you would.

2850
03:15:52,540 --> 03:15:54,726
SAM: As bats--

2851
03:15:54,726 --> 03:15:59,235
MATT: As bats however, it's a little more rough.
Let me check real fast just to be safe.

2852
03:15:59,235 --> 03:16:00,951
NOELLE: Can I use my sonar?

2853
03:16:00,951 --> 03:16:03,527
MARISHA: 5e bats--

2854
03:16:03,527 --> 03:16:06,486
MATT: Here we go.

2855
03:16:06,486 --> 03:16:08,567
TALIESIN: Nothing quite like googling '5e bats'.

2856
03:16:08,567 --> 03:16:09,856
LAURA: Yeah.

2857
03:16:09,856 --> 03:16:13,045
MARISHA: Bats--

2858
03:16:13,045 --> 03:16:15,630
MATT: Let's say swarm of bats. That's basically
what you guys are all together.

2859
03:16:15,630 --> 03:16:16,986
MARISHA: That's true. We are a swarm of bats.

2860
03:16:16,986 --> 03:16:19,077
MATT: Now, you have echolocation so you can, you
know--

2861
03:16:19,077 --> 03:16:21,113
LIAM: Oh man, put us in a Strahd campaign.

2862
03:16:21,113 --> 03:16:25,765
MATT: You have keen hearing but that's not going
to help you tremendously in this circumstance. So

2863
03:16:25,765 --> 03:16:33,134
yeah, there is a sinking feeling that right now,
either you-- going with them, you might leave your

2864
03:16:33,134 --> 03:16:39,667
friends behind. Just be aware. As you guys push
forward into this dark chamber, it continues

2865
03:16:39,667 --> 03:16:44,713
forward and then dips down into a series of
stairs. Takes you to a secondary level below. As

2866
03:16:44,713 --> 03:16:48,970
you guys follow this down for about 45 feet, it
evens out again and opens up into another

2867
03:16:48,970 --> 03:16:49,958
T-intersection.

2868
03:16:49,958 --> 03:16:51,209
LAURA, TRAVIS: Left!

2869
03:16:51,209 --> 03:16:54,903
MATT: All right. You guys go ahead and turn left.
As you turn, right around the corner, there

2870
03:16:54,903 --> 03:17:02,833
waiting, you see there is a single bone devil and
three flying spined devils. These deep blue, dark

2871
03:17:02,833 --> 03:17:07,761
green, imp-like devils with these giant spined
wings and these long quills sticking out of their

2872
03:17:07,761 --> 03:17:12,129
body as they carry these spears. And you all
almost-- you encounter each other at once. The

2873
03:17:12,129 --> 03:17:15,564
spined devils are up in your area and as you kind
of flutter past there's no way

2874
03:17:15,564 --> 03:17:16,488
they didn't see you.

2875
03:17:16,488 --> 03:17:17,855
LAURA: Chaos. Chaos.

2876
03:17:17,855 --> 03:17:19,074
MARISHA: (bat squeaks)

2877
03:17:19,074 --> 03:17:20,192
LIAM: Drop some guano.

2878
03:17:20,192 --> 03:17:21,418
LAURA: Yeah, I poop.

2879
03:17:21,418 --> 03:17:22,491
MATT: Okay.

2880
03:17:22,491 --> 03:17:23,534
TRAVIS: 'I poop'.

2881
03:17:23,534 --> 03:17:24,598
TALIESIN: Smells better than the prison.

2882
03:17:24,598 --> 03:17:25,690
LIAM: Guano, guano, guano.

2883
03:17:25,690 --> 03:17:30,316
MATT: As this is happening, the bone devil stops
and turns and the spine devils that get caught up

2884
03:17:30,316 --> 03:17:35,112
in the area, two of them are going to
instinctively swing at you guys as you move past.

2885
03:17:35,112 --> 03:17:36,633
LAURA: Oh god.

2886
03:17:36,633 --> 03:17:46,734
MATT: That is going to be-- there's the spined
devil here. That is an eight.

2887
03:17:46,734 --> 03:17:48,986
SAM: Oh wow.

2888
03:17:48,986 --> 03:17:49,865
TALIESIN: Oh.

2889
03:17:49,865 --> 03:17:51,574
SAM: That might actually miss.

2890
03:17:51,574 --> 03:17:57,578
MATT: I think it does, actually. The worst
possible-- A bat has an AC of 12.

2891
03:17:57,578 --> 03:17:59,452
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2892
03:17:59,452 --> 03:18:01,858
SAM: Guys, we have one hit point, by the way.

2893
03:18:01,858 --> 03:18:02,849
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

2894
03:18:02,849 --> 03:18:03,767
LAURA: Oh.

2895
03:18:03,767 --> 03:18:06,567
MARISHA: Those bats were jus-- I made no promises
other than bats.

2896
03:18:06,567 --> 03:18:07,736
TRAVIS: One hit point?

2897
03:18:07,736 --> 03:18:12,236
MATT: One hit point, each of you. The other one is
going to swing. Same roll! Two sixes in a row.

2898
03:18:12,236 --> 03:18:13,363
(cheering)

2899
03:18:13,363 --> 03:18:14,850
MATT: Eight. Eight. That is-- aw, man.

2900
03:18:14,850 --> 03:18:18,213
TRAVIS: 'Aw, man!'

2901
03:18:18,213 --> 03:18:20,494
LIAM: Matt turned 12! Matt turned 12!

2902
03:18:20,494 --> 03:18:27,066
MATT: So both of them miss as you guys continue
pushing forward past these--

2903
03:18:27,066 --> 03:18:28,368
MARISHA: Go, go, go!

2904
03:18:28,368 --> 03:18:31,562
MATT: However, the full speed of a bat, if I
remember--

2905
03:18:31,562 --> 03:18:32,545
SAM: 30 feet.

2906
03:18:32,545 --> 03:18:33,658
MATT: Is it 30-foot speed?

2907
03:18:33,658 --> 03:18:34,838
SAM: It's a 30-foot fly speed.

2908
03:18:34,838 --> 03:18:36,329
MARISHA: And we're definitely doubling our
movement here.

2909
03:18:36,329 --> 03:18:37,562
TALIESIN: And we're doubling movement.

2910
03:18:37,562 --> 03:18:38,238
LAURA: Yeah.

2911
03:18:38,238 --> 03:18:39,055
MATT: Correct.

2912
03:18:39,055 --> 03:18:40,021
LIAM: We're dashing.

2913
03:18:40,021 --> 03:18:41,405
MARISHA: And we're dashing

2914
03:18:41,405 --> 03:18:42,852
MATT: The spine devils are a little faster than
you guys.

2915
03:18:42,852 --> 03:18:43,640
SAM: Ooh.

2916
03:18:43,640 --> 03:18:45,717
MATT: And they're gaining on you. As you move
past, they get their attack swings but you guys do

2917
03:18:45,717 --> 03:18:51,312
double dash so they're behind you. And now they're
all starting to slowly gain. As they're pushing

2918
03:18:51,387 --> 03:18:54,359
forward and pushing forward, you come to another
T-intersection.

2919
03:18:54,359 --> 03:18:55,455
LAURA: Straight!

2920
03:18:55,455 --> 03:19:00,620
MATT: You go straight, okay. As you go straight
forward, it kind of curves a little bit to the

2921
03:19:00,620 --> 03:19:05,468
right and then continues forward. The spine devils
are just starting to catch up to you guys and two

2922
03:19:05,468 --> 03:19:09,825
of them go ahead and-- Let's see what attacks they
have here.

2923
03:19:09,825 --> 03:19:12,941
NOELLE: Are we passing any cells?

2924
03:19:12,941 --> 03:19:16,995
MATT: They're both going to fire tail spines at
you. Their tail curves up behind and swings. And

2925
03:19:16,995 --> 03:19:19,686
they fire these spines forward.

2926
03:19:19,686 --> 03:19:20,721
LAURA: Fly zig zag! Fly zig zag!

2927
03:19:20,721 --> 03:19:21,714
SAM: Serpentine.

2928
03:19:21,714 --> 03:19:25,507
MATT: There's three of them so one of them's going
to be at Grog, one's going to be at Vax and one's

2929
03:19:25,507 --> 03:19:31,813
going to be at Percy. Against Grog, that is a two
plus four. These guys can't hit anything. Six.

2930
03:19:31,813 --> 03:19:39,245
Just zooms past you. One towards Vax. That's
cocked. Natural 20.

2931
03:19:39,245 --> 03:19:40,595
(groaning)

2932
03:19:40,595 --> 03:19:44,427
MATT: And against you, Percy. That is a 19 plus
two, so both of you guys get hit.

2933
03:19:44,427 --> 03:19:45,414
LAURA: Fuck.

2934
03:19:45,414 --> 03:19:49,849
MATT: Even basic damage, both of your bat forms
(boof) and you both fall about ten feet.

2935
03:19:49,849 --> 03:19:51,565
LIAM: Is it an attack roll or--

2936
03:19:51,565 --> 03:19:52,687
LAURA: Yeah.

2937
03:19:52,687 --> 03:19:55,949
MATT: Yeah, they both hit-- spines hit you. You
both take--

2938
03:19:56,005 --> 03:19:57,508
LIAM: But if it's under my AC?

2939
03:19:57,508 --> 03:19:59,067
LAURA: No, it's a bat's AC.

2940
03:19:59,067 --> 03:19:59,917
TRAVIS: You're a bat.

2941
03:19:59,917 --> 03:20:00,867
LIAM: Oh we're a bat-- bat's AC.

2942
03:20:00,867 --> 03:20:01,733
MARISHA: Bat AC.

2943
03:20:01,733 --> 03:20:02,510
MATT: Bat's AC, which is 12.

2944
03:20:02,510 --> 03:20:03,372
LIAM: Thanks.

2945
03:20:03,372 --> 03:20:06,863
MATT: So that's six-- So you take five points of
damage, Vax, to your main form, and Percival, you

2946
03:20:06,863 --> 03:20:17,776
take four points of damage to your main form. Oh,
plus one point of fire damage and two points of

2947
03:20:17,776 --> 03:20:19,084
fire damage.

2948
03:20:19,084 --> 03:20:22,867
LIAM: My armor is set to fire, so do I take one
anyway?

2949
03:20:22,867 --> 03:20:24,059
MATT: You still take one.

2950
03:20:24,059 --> 03:20:24,847
LIAM: Okay.

2951
03:20:24,847 --> 03:20:26,016
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah. Just the two of us.

2952
03:20:26,016 --> 03:20:29,650
MATT: All right, so the rest of you are bats. Both
of you plummet, hit the ground, and the spine

2953
03:20:29,650 --> 03:20:31,108
devils approach.

2954
03:20:31,108 --> 03:20:34,462
TALIESIN: Attempt to acrobat roll, so that I'm up
and rolling?

2955
03:20:34,462 --> 03:20:35,696
SAM: Oh boy. Here we go.

2956
03:20:35,696 --> 03:20:37,290
LAURA: Oh dear lord.

2957
03:20:37,290 --> 03:20:40,683
MATT: So now, we have Vax and--

2958
03:20:40,683 --> 03:20:42,483
MARISHA: We did pretty good, you guys. We got
pretty far.

2959
03:20:42,483 --> 03:20:43,757
LAURA: Yeah, we did get pretty far.

2960
03:20:43,757 --> 03:20:44,859
TALIESIN: We did a lot. We did well.

2961
03:20:44,859 --> 03:20:47,435
MATT: Vax and Percival are back this way, I'm
going to say that these guys represent you as

2962
03:20:47,505 --> 03:21:07,044
bats. We'll say that Taryon is one, Keyleth is
two, Tova is three, Vex is four, and Grog is five.

2963
03:21:07,044 --> 03:21:17,035
All right. So, we'll use these for spine devils
for now. Well actually they're pretty small, so

2964
03:21:17,035 --> 03:21:25,002
we'll use these. So these are the spine devils
right here, and you see a bone devil coming up in

2965
03:21:25,002 --> 03:21:28,897
the distance. So I need everyone to roll
initiative.

2966
03:21:28,897 --> 03:21:32,820
TRAVIS: Yeah! Don't fuck me, Gil! That's it, go!

2967
03:21:32,820 --> 03:21:34,803
LIAM: Terrible. Terrible.

2968
03:21:34,803 --> 03:21:37,352
MARISHA: All right. Not great.

2969
03:21:37,352 --> 03:21:47,295
MATT: All right. So, that brings us to-- 25 to
20.

2970
03:21:47,295 --> 03:21:48,284
TALIESIN: 30.

2971
03:21:48,284 --> 03:21:49,224
NOELLE: 25.

2972
03:21:49,224 --> 03:21:50,028
LAURA: Wow.

2973
03:21:50,028 --> 03:21:51,020
MATT: Jesus, Percival.

2974
03:21:51,020 --> 03:21:52,226
TRAVIS: 20.

2975
03:21:52,226 --> 03:21:54,304
MATT: So, 30, 20.

2976
03:21:54,304 --> 03:21:55,528
TRAVIS: Tova had--

2977
03:21:55,528 --> 03:21:56,496
NOELLE: 25.

2978
03:21:56,496 --> 03:21:57,941
MATT: 25, nice.

2979
03:21:57,941 --> 03:21:59,098
TALIESIN: Are we making noise now? Do we care?

2980
03:21:59,098 --> 03:22:00,491
NOELLE: No, that was bad math. 23.

2981
03:22:00,491 --> 03:22:01,640
MATT: Okay, still good.

2982
03:22:01,640 --> 03:22:03,817
MARISHA: I don't know. If we can get in and out of
this quick and keep going--

2983
03:22:03,817 --> 03:22:04,816
MATT: 20 to 15?

2984
03:22:04,816 --> 03:22:10,484
MARISHA: -- because I can keep turning us into
these.

2985
03:22:10,484 --> 03:22:12,417
MATT: All right, 15 to ten.

2986
03:22:12,417 --> 03:22:13,556
TRAVIS: 15 to ten.

2987
03:22:13,556 --> 03:22:18,093
MARISHA: 11. As long as I don't lose concentration
I can keep turning us into different things.

2988
03:22:18,093 --> 03:22:19,807
TALIESIN: Including the two of us, even though we
hit one?

2989
03:22:19,807 --> 03:22:21,096
MARISHA: Correct.

2990
03:22:21,096 --> 03:22:22,039
TALIESIN: Good to know.

2991
03:22:22,039 --> 03:22:23,484
MATT: All right. Ten to five.

2992
03:22:23,484 --> 03:22:24,515
LIAM: Big seven.

2993
03:22:24,515 --> 03:22:25,665
LAURA: Eight.

2994
03:22:25,665 --> 03:22:29,318
MARISHA: It's a concentration of up to 24 hours,
so as long as I don't use a concentration--

2995
03:22:29,318 --> 03:22:30,628
TRAVIS: What are you, Tary?

2996
03:22:30,628 --> 03:22:31,440
SAM: Four.

2997
03:22:31,440 --> 03:22:32,229
LAURA: Oh!

2998
03:22:32,229 --> 03:22:33,007
MATT: Nice.

2999
03:22:33,007 --> 03:22:34,143
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

3000
03:22:34,143 --> 03:22:38,327
MARISHA: On a subsequent turn, I can use my action
to transform affected creatures into new forms.

3001
03:22:38,327 --> 03:22:41,259
MATT: So. Now in these forms, if it looks like
it--

3002
03:22:41,259 --> 03:22:44,749
SAM: We do get an attack.

3003
03:22:44,749 --> 03:22:46,917
MATT: You do, but you attack as a bat.

3004
03:22:46,917 --> 03:22:47,971
SAM: Yeah.

3005
03:22:47,971 --> 03:22:49,256
TRAVIS: Rabies.

3006
03:22:49,256 --> 03:22:50,573
LAURA: Can Keyleth just--

3007
03:22:50,573 --> 03:22:52,818
SAM: And a hit is one point of piercing damage.

3008
03:22:52,818 --> 03:22:56,966
LAURA: Wait, what was your initiative order? What
was your number?

3009
03:22:56,966 --> 03:22:58,154
MARISHA: 11.

3010
03:22:58,154 --> 03:22:59,277
LAURA: Fuck.

3011
03:22:59,277 --> 03:23:00,218
MARISHA: Not great.

3012
03:23:00,218 --> 03:23:01,667
NOELLE: We're stuck as bats until she lets us
out?

3013
03:23:01,667 --> 03:23:02,618
MATT: Yup.

3014
03:23:02,618 --> 03:23:06,814
LAURA: As long as you just stay out of the way and
don't break your concentration, you can keep

3015
03:23:06,814 --> 03:23:08,045
turning us in and out?

3016
03:23:08,045 --> 03:23:08,804
MARISHA: Correct.

3017
03:23:08,804 --> 03:23:09,955
LAURA: Okay. Don't get hit.

3018
03:23:09,955 --> 03:23:12,649
MARISHA: So that's probably exactly what I'm going
to do, is to try and not get hit, by the by.

3019
03:23:12,649 --> 03:23:17,838
MATT: Percival. You just plummeted to the ground.
Actually, both you and Vax from the fall, since

3020
03:23:17,838 --> 03:23:25,600
you were 15 feet up, you both took two points of
bludgeoning damage, and five points of bludgeoning

3021
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:26,672
damage, Vax.

3022
03:23:26,672 --> 03:23:28,027
LIAM: Okay.

3023
03:23:28,027 --> 03:23:29,140
MATT: All right.

3024
03:23:29,140 --> 03:23:42,118
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to take my six paces
towards the lava pit, and then--

3025
03:23:42,118 --> 03:23:43,357
TRAVIS: Is it a blood pit or a lava pit?

3026
03:23:43,357 --> 03:23:44,428
MATT: It's a blood pit.

3027
03:23:44,428 --> 03:23:47,586
TALIESIN: -- blood pit, and then I'm going to hold
my attack until Vax does what he's going to do.

3028
03:23:47,586 --> 03:23:48,938
MATT: Okay.

3029
03:23:48,938 --> 03:23:50,099
TALIESIN: I'm loud.

3030
03:23:50,099 --> 03:23:52,804
LIAM: Yeah. And I'm weak.

3031
03:23:52,804 --> 03:23:54,654
MATT: All right, that ends Percy's turn. Tova.

3032
03:23:54,654 --> 03:24:01,580
NOELLE: So, can I go from a bat to a bear?

3033
03:24:01,580 --> 03:24:05,253
LIAM: Bat-bear! Were-bat-bear! Batman.

3034
03:24:05,253 --> 03:24:06,993
SAM: There, bat-bear.

3035
03:24:06,993 --> 03:24:08,584
LAURA: Tricky, tricky.

3036
03:24:08,584 --> 03:24:09,788
LIAM: Bear-man. Man-bear.

3037
03:24:09,788 --> 03:24:10,784
MATT: The magic keeps you--

3038
03:24:10,784 --> 03:24:13,174
MARISHA: "Choose any number of willing creatures
that you can see within range, you transform each

3039
03:24:13,244 --> 03:24:15,829
"target into the form of a large or smaller
beast."

3040
03:24:15,829 --> 03:24:21,026
MATT: Technically, you are not a dwarf. You are
not a Blood Hunter. You lost the abilities of your

3041
03:24:21,026 --> 03:24:27,461
class while you are currently a bat, so currently
you just have bat capabilities. You could move and

3042
03:24:27,461 --> 03:24:34,732
then hold your action if you were to change forms.
It's up to you. Kind of what Percy did.

3043
03:24:34,732 --> 03:24:38,625
TALIESIN: Get in position and then wait.

3044
03:24:38,625 --> 03:24:44,252
NOELLE: I'm going to fly over with my dudes and
hang out and hold my action.

3045
03:24:44,252 --> 03:24:47,708
MATT: All right, so you'll hang there. All right.
Grog.

3046
03:24:47,708 --> 03:24:51,082
TRAVIS: I'm just following Vex.

3047
03:24:51,082 --> 03:24:54,986
MATT: Okay, so you'll just kind of stay over in
this area.

3048
03:24:54,986 --> 03:24:57,710
TRAVIS: I'm real good with directions but, let's
be honest.

3049
03:24:57,710 --> 03:25:06,626
MATT: All right. So these three spine devils who
just hit the other-- This one here is going to

3050
03:25:06,626 --> 03:25:13,735
rush over to this side, is going to fire, this is
going to be at Tova. It's going to fire its tail

3051
03:25:13,735 --> 03:25:21,418
spine. That is an eight. I keep rolling sixes to
hit. Misses, no effect. These two other spine

3052
03:25:21,418 --> 03:25:36,276
devils here are going to-- There we go, they're
going to come forward and do a multi-attack on

3053
03:25:36,276 --> 03:25:45,587
Vax. Both of them are just going to pincer up this
way. One with its bite, and one with its fork.

3054
03:25:45,587 --> 03:25:52,590
Actually, technically it gets to use two tail spines.
It's going to make a second strike at you, Tova.

3055
03:25:52,660 --> 03:25:55,368
That is an 11, misses still.

3056
03:25:55,432 --> 03:25:58,134
NOELLE: Yup. I mean, unless my--

3057
03:25:58,134 --> 03:25:59,641
SAM: Unhittable bats.

3058
03:25:59,641 --> 03:26:03,272
NOELLE: Unless my bat stats are-- bad.

3059
03:26:03,272 --> 03:26:06,719
MATT: Bat AC is 12, so you're actually like
(whoosh), you dodge out of the way.

3060
03:26:06,719 --> 03:26:07,767
NOELLE: Oh, okay.

3061
03:26:07,767 --> 03:26:14,788
MATT: And that is a seven, and a 21. 21 hit you?

3062
03:26:14,844 --> 03:26:18,717
LIAM: No. Nope. Oh, it just hits me.

3063
03:26:18,798 --> 03:26:24,093
MATT: It just? That's what I thought. So you take
five points of piercing damage.

3064
03:26:24,093 --> 03:26:26,261
LIAM: Can I Uncanny Dodge?

3065
03:26:26,318 --> 03:26:28,081
MATT: All right, you take two points of piercing
damage.

3066
03:26:28,081 --> 03:26:29,390
LIAM: Okay.

3067
03:26:29,390 --> 03:26:35,060
MATT: The other one is going to attack you again
twice as well. That's a four and an 11. Nope.

3068
03:26:35,060 --> 03:26:36,888
LIAM: Yeah, eat it.

3069
03:26:36,888 --> 03:26:44,203
MATT: Ending their turn now. The bone devil is
going to catch up, flies in, its wings expanding

3070
03:26:44,203 --> 03:26:48,838
forward, it's going to go ahead and make three
attacks against you, Vax, since you're the closest

3071
03:26:48,838 --> 03:26:59,075
one to it. That is ten, 20, and 20.

3072
03:26:59,075 --> 03:27:00,093
LIAM: No.

3073
03:27:00,093 --> 03:27:03,401
MATT: Two twelves in a row. You just (whoosh),
dodging out of the way, being crazy rogue,

3074
03:27:03,401 --> 03:27:07,451
evading. That brings us now to Keyleth.

3075
03:27:07,451 --> 03:27:11,872
MARISHA: Oh, shit. Can I change people as a bat?

3076
03:27:11,872 --> 03:27:16,143
MATT: Yeah, as an action, you can change your
form, which is an action.

3077
03:27:16,143 --> 03:27:18,318
MARISHA: But can I stay as a bat and change other
people?

3078
03:27:18,318 --> 03:27:19,169
MATT: Yeah.

3079
03:27:19,169 --> 03:27:20,087
MARISHA: Yeah?

3080
03:27:20,087 --> 03:27:28,534
MATT: It says here, "On a subsequent action you
can use your actions to transform affected

3081
03:27:28,712 --> 03:27:33,170
"creatures into new forms." So yeah. I don't see
why you couldn't.

3082
03:27:33,170 --> 03:27:35,152
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to turn-- do you want to
be a bat, too?

3083
03:27:35,152 --> 03:27:36,329
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm useless.

3084
03:27:36,329 --> 03:27:43,686
MARISHA: I'm going to turn both Vax and Percy into
bats. What? I asked what you wanted to be and you

3085
03:27:43,686 --> 03:27:45,665
said a bat. Bat! We're both bats!

3086
03:27:45,665 --> 03:27:47,637
LIAM: That is what I want to be. You just do it.

3087
03:27:47,637 --> 03:27:49,227
TRAVIS: You didn't even have time to ask that
question.

3088
03:27:49,227 --> 03:27:50,848
MARISHA: And we're peaced out again.

3089
03:27:50,848 --> 03:27:52,107
LAURA: If we can, we're going to peace out.

3090
03:27:52,107 --> 03:27:53,750
MARISHA: If we can, we're going to peace out.

3091
03:27:53,750 --> 03:27:55,189
MATT: Who else is going to turn into bats?

3092
03:27:55,189 --> 03:27:57,286
SAM: Bats. We're all bats.

3093
03:27:57,286 --> 03:27:59,297
LAURA: We're all bats again.

3094
03:27:59,297 --> 03:28:04,599
MATT: Okay. All right. And so you're just going
to do that? It's your turn, you going to move?

3095
03:28:04,669 --> 03:28:10,340
MARISHA: I'm going to look at Vex and go
(squeaking noise).

3096
03:28:10,340 --> 03:28:14,388
LAURA: I wink as a bat like I totally understand
her.

3097
03:28:14,388 --> 03:28:16,424
MATT: Okay. Is that your turn, Keyleth?

3098
03:28:16,424 --> 03:28:17,767
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3099
03:28:17,767 --> 03:28:19,107
TRAVIS: You're not going to move?

3100
03:28:19,107 --> 03:28:20,673
MARISHA: I'm following her!

3101
03:28:20,673 --> 03:28:25,277
LAURA: Well, would she move? She's got to wait
until Vax gets out of there, now he's surrounded

3102
03:28:25,277 --> 03:28:26,279
and he's a bat.

3103
03:28:26,279 --> 03:28:27,790
MARISHA: Vex was leading the way, she knows where
to go.

3104
03:28:27,790 --> 03:28:29,352
MATT: Vex, your turn.

3105
03:28:29,352 --> 03:28:36,936
LAURA: I want to lead everybody away down to the
right, but I've got to make sure that my brother

3106
03:28:36,936 --> 03:28:44,477
gets away from these thugs before that happens, so
I'm going to hold my movement until-- can I--

3107
03:28:44,533 --> 03:28:47,848
MATT: You can't hold your movement, you can only
hold an action. You can hold a dash action.

3108
03:28:47,848 --> 03:28:52,373
LAURA: I'm going to hold my dash action, then,
until I see that he's safe. Or at least he's away

3109
03:28:52,373 --> 03:28:54,698
from them, so we can get going.

3110
03:28:54,698 --> 03:28:58,658
LIAM: As a bat, do I have an action and bonus
action like Vax does, or just one thing now?

3111
03:28:58,737 --> 03:29:02,083
MATT: You have your action as a bat. You can dash,
still, if you want to.

3112
03:29:02,083 --> 03:29:04,946
LIAM: Well, I will disengage as a bat?

3113
03:29:04,946 --> 03:29:06,291
MATT: Disengage is an action.

3114
03:29:06,291 --> 03:29:07,993
LIAM: Can I use my action to disengage?

3115
03:29:07,993 --> 03:29:09,720
MATT: So you could.

3116
03:29:09,720 --> 03:29:11,528
LAURA: Bats disengage.

3117
03:29:11,528 --> 03:29:14,063
LIAM: Yeah. We're in new territory.

3118
03:29:14,063 --> 03:29:16,940
MATT: Anybody can disengage as an action, it's
just a combat action. You just can't do anything

3119
03:29:16,940 --> 03:29:18,583
else, the only thing you can do is move with your
speed after that.

3120
03:29:18,583 --> 03:29:23,293
LIAM: If they hit me, I'm back to being in regular
form again, and there's three of them, so I'm

3121
03:29:23,293 --> 03:29:24,301
going to disengage--

3122
03:29:24,301 --> 03:29:25,279
MATT: All right, so you disengage.

3123
03:29:25,279 --> 03:29:26,987
LIAM: -- and then fly as far as I can towards the
group.

3124
03:29:26,987 --> 03:29:32,110
MATT: Okay, 30 feet. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.
That's where you get.

3125
03:29:32,110 --> 03:29:34,966
LAURA: Okay, I see him, and we have everybody now.
I take off to the right.

3126
03:29:34,966 --> 03:29:38,421
MATT: Which way is the right? You guys moved in
this way? So, this way.

3127
03:29:38,421 --> 03:29:39,350
LAURA: Yeah.

3128
03:29:39,350 --> 03:29:41,090
MATT: Okay. So using your dash action--

3129
03:29:41,090 --> 03:29:45,742
LAURA: It was the last thing, it was to the right
was the final turn. Right?

3130
03:29:45,742 --> 03:29:46,786
SAM: Yup, yup.

3131
03:29:46,786 --> 03:29:48,066
MARISHA: Right, yeah, to the right.

3132
03:29:48,066 --> 03:29:50,274
TALIESIN: I've been holding an action, right? Can
I burn that as a dash action?

3133
03:29:50,274 --> 03:29:52,034
LAURA: I know! Why did he say it like that, like
it was--

3134
03:29:52,034 --> 03:29:56,586
MARISHA: Yeah, as far as we know, the right means
right.

3135
03:29:56,586 --> 03:29:58,961
SAM: Maybe it's stage right.

3136
03:29:58,961 --> 03:30:03,948
LAURA: But everything else was-- I'm going to the
right. That's the last intersection that I know.

3137
03:30:03,948 --> 03:30:06,818
MATT: All right, so that ends Vex's turn there.
Taryon.

3138
03:30:06,818 --> 03:30:10,306
SAM: I'm going to go where she went. And further
if I can.

3139
03:30:10,306 --> 03:30:14,701
MATT: And you are off the page, over that way.

3140
03:30:14,701 --> 03:30:17,057
TALIESIN: Can I burn my action as a dash?

3141
03:30:17,057 --> 03:30:18,228
MATT: You can, yeah.

3142
03:30:18,228 --> 03:30:19,605
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm burning my action as a dash.

3143
03:30:19,605 --> 03:30:20,596
MATT: All right, so that's--

3144
03:30:20,596 --> 03:30:22,038
MARISHA: Let's go!

3145
03:30:22,038 --> 03:30:25,027
SAM: Bye!

3146
03:30:25,027 --> 03:30:29,758
LAURA: Toodles. As much as we can be, toodles.

3147
03:30:29,882 --> 03:30:32,270
MARISHA: Dear god, I can't believe this shit.

3148
03:30:32,270 --> 03:30:35,244
MATT: That brings us to Percy.

3149
03:30:35,423 --> 03:30:37,641
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep booking.

3150
03:30:37,641 --> 03:30:48,173
MATT: Five, ten, 30, and you also with a double
move get to there. Okay. Next up is Tova.

3151
03:30:48,173 --> 03:30:51,368
NOELLE: Oh, I'll just keep going with the rest.

3152
03:30:51,368 --> 03:30:55,080
MATT: You just keep going? All right, so you catch
up with these guys here way off the map. All

3153
03:30:55,080 --> 03:30:56,676
righty. Grog.

3154
03:30:56,676 --> 03:30:59,180
TRAVIS: I'm going to burn my "ashton" as a
"darsh."

3155
03:30:59,180 --> 03:31:00,919
(laughter)

3156
03:31:00,919 --> 03:31:09,795
MATT: (gibberish) All righty. With that, the spine
devils are going to move forward.

3157
03:31:09,795 --> 03:31:15,278
LAURA: Who is that? Is that Keyleth?

3158
03:31:15,278 --> 03:31:17,612
MATT: That is Percy.

3159
03:31:17,612 --> 03:31:20,067
LAURA: Oh, it is? No, but Percy's off the map!

3160
03:31:20,067 --> 03:31:25,017
MATT: Oh, I'm sorry. It's Keyleth. Yeah, because I
have one-two, but you guys both transformed.

3161
03:31:25,017 --> 03:31:27,304
MARISHA: But I was holding my movement to move
with Vex.

3162
03:31:27,304 --> 03:31:28,806
LAURA and TALIESIN: You can't hold movement.

3163
03:31:28,806 --> 03:31:30,909
MARISHA: I can't fucking hold a movement. I did an
action to make sure they were bats.

3164
03:31:30,909 --> 03:31:34,714
MATT: Yep. So you get swarmed by 
three spined devils.

3165
03:31:34,798 --> 03:31:37,100
LAURA: Fucking balls. This is not good planning.

3166
03:31:37,100 --> 03:31:39,244
LIAM: We might be able to outrun them.

3167
03:31:39,244 --> 03:31:54,926
MATT: Not in this form. Attacks against you. Yep,
that's an 18. Keyleth, you take six points of

3168
03:31:54,926 --> 03:32:02,523
slashing damage. Your bat form is gone, you drop
that. You become Keyleth again and you take five

3169
03:32:02,523 --> 03:32:09,879
points of damage carried over. Then it's going to
get its tail attack against you. It's going to

3170
03:32:09,879 --> 03:32:16,265
miss. The other one's going to bite. Miss. Tail
attack is going to be a 17. What's your AC?

3171
03:32:16,265 --> 03:32:19,218
MARISHA: Currently, 16.

3172
03:32:19,218 --> 03:32:23,770
MATT: So you take six points of piercing damage.
The last one's going to get its last two attacks

3173
03:32:23,770 --> 03:32:30,125
on you. That is a 21 and a natural one. So the
last attack you get is four points of

3174
03:32:30,125 --> 03:32:31,585
slashing damage.

3175
03:32:31,585 --> 03:32:36,747
MARISHA: So it's six plus four total? So, ten?
Okay.

3176
03:32:36,747 --> 03:32:40,284
MATT: And I need you to go ahead and make three
concentration checks. It's got to beat

3177
03:32:40,284 --> 03:32:42,444
ten each time.

3178
03:32:42,444 --> 03:32:52,655
MARISHA: Good the first time. Good the second
time. And seven plus my constitution, correct?

3179
03:32:52,655 --> 03:32:53,598
MATT: Yes.

3180
03:32:53,598 --> 03:32:57,242
MARISHA: So that is an 11 the third time.

3181
03:32:57,242 --> 03:32:59,908
MATT: Your constitution saving throw?

3182
03:32:59,908 --> 03:33:01,162
MARISHA: All three.

3183
03:33:01,162 --> 03:33:03,795
MATT: That's enough. So you maintain concentration
on the spell.

3184
03:33:03,795 --> 03:33:05,179
LAURA: Solid.

3185
03:33:05,179 --> 03:33:07,335
LIAM: Thanks, Keyleth.

3186
03:33:07,335 --> 03:33:08,552
MARISHA: You're welcome!

3187
03:33:08,552 --> 03:33:13,302
MATT: The bone devil flies up and is now going
after Keyleth with all of its might.

3188
03:33:13,302 --> 03:33:18,245
MARISHA: Did we heal any? We didn't do any of that
healing or anything, did we?

3189
03:33:18,245 --> 03:33:19,685
MATT: Nope! You didn't have time.

3190
03:33:19,685 --> 03:33:21,066
MARISHA: That's cool.

3191
03:33:21,066 --> 03:33:25,093
MATT: Three attacks. That is going to be an 18 for
its claw.

3192
03:33:25,093 --> 03:33:26,615
MARISHA: Hit.

3193
03:33:26,615 --> 03:33:29,584
MATT: Second claw, that's a 27.

3194
03:33:29,584 --> 03:33:30,922
MARISHA: Yeah.

3195
03:33:30,922 --> 03:33:38,585
MATT: And the sting is a 25. So all three hit you.
So you take nine points of slashing damage.

3196
03:33:38,585 --> 03:33:41,034
Concentration check.

3197
03:33:41,034 --> 03:33:45,443
MARISHA: I mean, I'm about to go down. I make it!

3198
03:33:45,443 --> 03:33:50,843
MATT: All right. That is 12 points of slashing
damage.

3199
03:33:50,843 --> 03:33:54,231
MARISHA: I'm down. Everyone's about to hit the
ground.

3200
03:33:54,463 --> 03:33:59,284
MATT: Keyleth falls unconscious. And the tail
strikes you, auto crit.

3201
03:33:59,284 --> 03:34:01,244
You lose two death saving throws.

3202
03:34:01,244 --> 03:34:03,912
(yelling)

3203
03:34:03,912 --> 03:34:05,211
TALIESIN: We're all human now.

3204
03:34:05,211 --> 03:34:06,254
MARISHA: And you're all human.

3205
03:34:06,254 --> 03:34:15,119
MATT: All of you drop form. So four would be Vex.

3206
03:34:15,119 --> 03:34:17,362
TALIESIN: Okay, got to fix this super fast.

3207
03:34:17,362 --> 03:34:20,899
MARISHA: Really not looking good.

3208
03:34:20,899 --> 03:34:25,149
LAURA: Everybody's far away from her except for me
and-- who's the other person?

3209
03:34:25,149 --> 03:34:27,417
MATT: Aw man, where did my Vex model go?

3210
03:34:27,417 --> 03:34:30,034
LAURA: Oh no, did I disappear?

3211
03:34:30,034 --> 03:34:32,711
MATT: I think I may actually have left you on the
other map. That's okay,

3212
03:34:32,711 --> 03:34:34,193
I'll be fine for this one.

3213
03:34:34,193 --> 03:34:35,939
LAURA: Oh, because I was in a corner.

3214
03:34:35,939 --> 03:34:37,891
MATT: I'll use the erinyes for you. That's fine.

3215
03:34:37,891 --> 03:34:46,117
LAURA: That's okay, that's pretty hot. Can you put
a little marker on me so I can see it? I can't see

3216
03:34:46,117 --> 03:34:47,523
the erinyes.

3217
03:34:47,523 --> 03:34:50,723
MATT: That's you.

3218
03:34:50,723 --> 03:34:52,192
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

3219
03:34:52,192 --> 03:35:04,352
MATT: You're welcome. Percival, Vax, Taryon,
Tova.

3220
03:35:04,424 --> 03:35:07,047
SAM: Percy, my necklace is glowing.

3221
03:35:07,047 --> 03:35:08,533
TALIESIN: Yeah, we all know.

3222
03:35:08,533 --> 03:35:12,905
SAM: And I'm not a bat. Does that mean Keyleth's
dead?

3223
03:35:12,905 --> 03:35:19,254
MATT: End of their turn. Keyleth. It's your turn.
You're next in the initiative order.

3224
03:35:19,254 --> 03:35:20,694
TALIESIN: Oh shit, no.

3225
03:35:20,694 --> 03:35:22,192
LAURA: Oh god.

3226
03:35:22,192 --> 03:35:30,790
MARISHA: Oh my god, I've never been here. I don't
want to die. Who do I do this to?

3227
03:35:30,790 --> 03:35:32,043
SAM: You just rolled it.

3228
03:35:32,043 --> 03:35:39,431
MARISHA: I did. It's a 13. Technically. Yeah. I
was going to switch dice, but that's a 13, I'll

3229
03:35:39,503 --> 03:35:40,845
take that.

3230
03:35:40,845 --> 03:35:42,386
MATT: Was it the intentional roll?

3231
03:35:42,386 --> 03:35:44,937
MARISHA: No. Okay.

3232
03:35:44,937 --> 03:35:47,133
TALIESIN: No, that's not-- Oh.

3233
03:35:47,133 --> 03:35:51,150
MARISHA: Don't fuck me Gil.

3234
03:35:51,150 --> 03:35:53,135
I'm good. I'm good.

3235
03:35:53,135 --> 03:35:54,043
MATT: What did you roll?

3236
03:35:54,043 --> 03:35:55,397
MARISHA: It's a 12. I rolled a 12.

3237
03:35:55,397 --> 03:36:00,608
MATT: Okay. Still bleeding out. Man, losing that
Plane Shift.

3238
03:36:00,608 --> 03:36:03,659
MARISHA: A success. What did you just say?

3239
03:36:03,659 --> 03:36:08,962
LAURA: Oh my god, if she dies, we're fucked

3240
03:36:08,962 --> 03:36:10,528
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

3241
03:36:10,528 --> 03:36:13,433
TRAVIS: That was a big oversight.

3242
03:36:13,433 --> 03:36:16,163
MATT: That would've been campaign over. Okay.

3243
03:36:16,163 --> 03:36:20,724
MARISHA: No, we're good, guys. Come on.

3244
03:36:20,724 --> 03:36:22,258
TALIESIN: That might be campaign over.

3245
03:36:22,258 --> 03:36:23,312
MATT: Well, I don't know.

3246
03:36:23,312 --> 03:36:26,370
TRAVIS: Oh my god, what the fuck were we
thinking?

3247
03:36:26,370 --> 03:36:28,580
MATT: I'm so nervous right now, oh my god.

3248
03:36:28,580 --> 03:36:38,430
LAURA: I'm up! I run forward and I slide on my
knees and put my hand on her and cast Cure Wounds

3249
03:36:38,449 --> 03:36:40,243
at 4th level. On Keyleth.

3250
03:36:40,243 --> 03:36:41,882
MATT: Okay. All right.

3251
03:36:41,882 --> 03:36:45,292
SAM. Campaign resumes.

3252
03:36:45,292 --> 03:36:47,297
MATT: Holy shit.

3253
03:36:47,297 --> 03:36:48,513
MARISHA: I'm great, I'm good.

3254
03:36:48,513 --> 03:36:50,841
TRAVIS: Aw, man. That roll was bigger than I
knew.

3255
03:36:50,841 --> 03:36:53,494
TALIESIN: Yeah, that would've been fucking bad.

3256
03:36:53,494 --> 03:37:00,049
MATT: You guys have a spreading urgency of the
entire prison of Mentiri now bearing down on

3257
03:37:00,049 --> 03:37:05,034
escaped mortal criminals. Without Plane Shift, if
that doesn't work...

3258
03:37:05,034 --> 03:37:11,309
MARISHA: Okay, all right. So we have the extreme
hint.

3259
03:37:11,309 --> 03:37:15,011
SAM: But we were bats, Matt. That was pretty fine
planning.

3260
03:37:15,011 --> 03:37:18,888
MARISHA: That was awesome. It was going great.

3261
03:37:18,888 --> 03:37:20,316
LAURA: 27 points.

3262
03:37:20,316 --> 03:37:21,640
MATT: You heal 27 points, Keyleth.

3263
03:37:21,640 --> 03:37:23,115
MARISHA: Okay.

3264
03:37:23,115 --> 03:37:25,157
LAURA: That's my action.

3265
03:37:25,157 --> 03:37:26,697
MATT: Your movement.

3266
03:37:26,697 --> 03:37:27,695
LAURA: Yeah.

3267
03:37:27,695 --> 03:37:29,075
TALIESIN: You have a bonus.

3268
03:37:29,075 --> 03:37:31,952
TRAVIS: You want to heal yourself? Potions?

3269
03:37:31,952 --> 03:37:34,548
LAURA: I'm going to pop Trinket out, as my bonus.

3270
03:37:34,548 --> 03:37:37,791
MATT: Whereabouts?

3271
03:37:37,791 --> 03:37:42,867
LAURA: Behind-- sure, whatever.

3272
03:37:42,867 --> 03:37:45,572
MATT: I'll say, just instinctually, you pop him
out about there.

3273
03:37:45,572 --> 03:37:46,678
LAURA: Yeah.

3274
03:37:46,678 --> 03:37:47,747
MATT: All right.

3275
03:37:47,747 --> 03:37:49,747
LAURA: And that was my full movement and
everything, wasn't it?

3276
03:37:49,747 --> 03:37:53,453
MATT: Yeah. All right, Vax, it's your turn.

3277
03:37:53,453 --> 03:37:58,830
LIAM: I run and skip right up next to my sister
and I have a potion of superior healing and I pour

3278
03:37:58,830 --> 03:38:00,332
it into Keyleth's mouth.

3279
03:38:00,332 --> 03:38:01,367
MATT: All right.

3280
03:38:01,367 --> 03:38:02,628
MARISHA: I'm conscious.

3281
03:38:02,628 --> 03:38:03,673
LIAM: Yes, I know.

3282
03:38:03,673 --> 03:38:07,615
MATT: (gurgles)

3283
03:38:07,615 --> 03:38:10,575
(laughter)

3284
03:38:10,575 --> 03:38:16,436
LIAM: 22 more.

3285
03:38:16,436 --> 03:38:26,718
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Vax! I'm at 49 hit points.

3286
03:38:26,718 --> 03:38:30,594
MATT: You didn't realize until the last moment and
was like, "Oh, if Keyleth goes down."

3287
03:38:30,594 --> 03:38:33,772
LAURA: Bad News Bears.

3288
03:38:33,832 --> 03:38:37,740
LIAM: How long has it been since the pit fiend
moment?

3289
03:38:37,740 --> 03:38:42,685
MATT: It's been roughly an hour. A little over an
hour.

3290
03:38:42,685 --> 03:38:49,403
LIAM: All right. And I'm going to, as a bonus
action, chuck Whisper into-- no, it has to be tied

3291
03:38:49,403 --> 03:38:50,588
to an action, doesn't it?

3292
03:38:50,588 --> 03:38:53,409
MATT: It has to be after an attack, yeah.

3293
03:38:53,409 --> 03:38:55,351
LIAM: Oh, well there's nothing else I can do.

3294
03:38:55,351 --> 03:38:57,734
TALIESIN: Stand her up.

3295
03:38:57,734 --> 03:39:00,341
LIAM: I can get up with a bonus action, though?

3296
03:39:00,341 --> 03:39:01,550
MARISHA: Can you help me up?

3297
03:39:01,550 --> 03:39:03,623
LIAM: No, bonus action was the potion, no? Can't
the potion be a bonus?

3298
03:39:03,623 --> 03:39:05,555
LAURA: No, not if you give it to somebody else.

3299
03:39:05,555 --> 03:39:06,795
LIAM: Okay. Then I'm done.

3300
03:39:06,795 --> 03:39:08,551
MATT: So, Taryon.

3301
03:39:08,551 --> 03:39:10,653
LAURA: Do you have any spells? Like a Bless or
anything?

3302
03:39:10,653 --> 03:39:12,180
LIAM: No, I'm out.

3303
03:39:12,180 --> 03:39:13,720
SAM: How far away am I?

3304
03:39:13,720 --> 03:39:17,914
MATT: You're about-- with 30-foot movement you can
get within range where you can see any of the

3305
03:39:17,974 --> 03:39:19,475
creatures.

3306
03:39:19,475 --> 03:39:22,995
SAM: Okay. I'll run back then, I guess.

3307
03:39:22,995 --> 03:39:26,772
MATT: Okay. You'll get there.

3308
03:39:26,831 --> 03:39:32,911
LAURA: Bring everything in to use so you can 
just (poosh) to them.

3309
03:39:32,911 --> 03:39:37,562
MATT: Yeah. You have these three little spine
devils that are like flying imps covered in spines

3310
03:39:37,562 --> 03:39:41,638
that are relatively small, and you have one big
bone devil-- that was the one that just almost

3311
03:39:41,638 --> 03:39:43,368
killed Keyleth.

3312
03:39:43,368 --> 03:39:48,283
SAM: I'll throw acid at one, I guess.

3313
03:39:48,283 --> 03:39:49,794
MATT: At which one?

3314
03:39:49,794 --> 03:39:52,594
SAM: The one who looks the meanest.

3315
03:39:52,594 --> 03:39:58,575
MATT: That's the bone devil. All right. Dex save.
That is a 14. What's your DC?

3316
03:39:58,575 --> 03:40:00,307
SAM: 17.

3317
03:40:00,307 --> 03:40:02,011
MATT: So yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.

3318
03:40:02,011 --> 03:40:03,322
TALIESIN: Yay.

3319
03:40:03,322 --> 03:40:13,640
SAM: Okay. Give me some sixes. And one more. Boom.
Oh, lots.

3320
03:40:13,640 --> 03:40:17,778
(laughter)

3321
03:40:17,778 --> 03:40:20,884
LAURA: How did this happen? How did we get here?

3322
03:40:20,884 --> 03:40:23,236
SAM: 25.

3323
03:40:23,236 --> 03:40:25,904
MATT: 25 points of acid damage to the bone devil.

3324
03:40:25,904 --> 03:40:27,025
LAURA: Nice!

3325
03:40:27,025 --> 03:40:30,163
LIAM: Fiancee and campaign? Killed.

3326
03:40:30,163 --> 03:40:35,505
MATT: So as the vial breaks across the front of
its body, you can see the acid burn its flesh. It

3327
03:40:35,505 --> 03:40:40,642
curls into itself; you can see the smoke rising
off of it as its flesh is beginning to burn and

3328
03:40:40,642 --> 03:40:43,246
melt away. Nice. That's your turn.

3329
03:40:43,246 --> 03:40:46,348
SAM: All right, I will cast Sanctuary on young
Keyleth.

3330
03:40:46,348 --> 03:40:48,193
MATT: Oh shit!

3331
03:40:48,193 --> 03:40:49,357
TALIESIN: Nice!

3332
03:40:49,357 --> 03:40:52,104
LAURA: That's the first time you've helped another
person, right?

3333
03:40:52,104 --> 03:40:53,375
SAM: In my life.

3334
03:40:53,375 --> 03:40:57,412
(laughter)

3335
03:40:57,412 --> 03:41:01,444
MATT: Oh, Taryon. All right, Percy, you're up.

3336
03:41:01,444 --> 03:41:07,683
TALIESIN: Fuck sound at this point, I suppose. I'm
going to run and just get them into view.

3337
03:41:07,683 --> 03:41:09,131
MATT: Yep, you got them.

3338
03:41:09,131 --> 03:41:11,673
TALIESIN: All right. Three shots, and I'm going to
do a pushback on all three and I'm going to push

3339
03:41:11,673 --> 03:41:12,675
them all--

3340
03:41:12,675 --> 03:41:14,086
MATT: The spine devils, you mean?

3341
03:41:14,086 --> 03:41:15,729
TALIESIN: Spine devil, spine devil, bone devil.

3342
03:41:15,729 --> 03:41:18,468
MATT: Okay, so there's three spine devils and one
bone devil. So two spine devils and

3343
03:41:18,468 --> 03:41:19,495
one bone devil.

3344
03:41:19,495 --> 03:41:21,378
TALIESIN: Three spine devils and one bone devil?

3345
03:41:21,378 --> 03:41:24,128
MATT: Yes. Three spine devils and one bone devil.

3346
03:41:24,128 --> 03:41:25,866
TALIESIN: Three spine devils and one bone devil?

3347
03:41:25,866 --> 03:41:28,714
TRAVIS: Stop saying it.

3348
03:41:28,714 --> 03:41:30,408
MARISHA: No Coke, Pepsi.

3349
03:41:30,408 --> 03:41:33,935
TALIESIN: No Coke, Pepsi. And the bone devil's a
real problem, I suppose.

3350
03:41:33,935 --> 03:41:35,634
MATT: He's the dangerous-looking one.

3351
03:41:35,634 --> 03:41:38,193
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case, I'm going to push
him back. I'm going to do a shot

3352
03:41:38,193 --> 03:41:39,184
to push him back.

3353
03:41:39,184 --> 03:41:42,182
MATT: All right.

3354
03:41:42,182 --> 03:41:45,550
TALIESIN: And that's a 19, 29--

3355
03:41:45,550 --> 03:41:46,682
MATT: Yeah, you hit.

3356
03:41:46,682 --> 03:41:49,283
LIAM: Pop-pop-pop, motherfucker!

3357
03:41:49,283 --> 03:41:52,983
LAURA and MARISHA: (sing "mmmbop")

3358
03:41:52,983 --> 03:41:57,908
TALIESIN: That's my power song, you don't even
know. 15 points of damage, plus five psychic, and

3359
03:41:57,908 --> 03:41:59,774
he moves backwards ten feet.

3360
03:41:59,774 --> 03:42:03,970
MATT: So 20 damage. He pushes back just that far,
but he hits the wall. He can't get

3361
03:42:03,970 --> 03:42:05,424
pushed back further.

3362
03:42:05,424 --> 03:42:06,627
TALIESIN: Can't get pushed any-- he's still--

3363
03:42:06,627 --> 03:42:07,771
MATT: Still right there.

3364
03:42:07,771 --> 03:42:09,700
LIAM: Percy's in hell, Hanson playing in his
brain.

3365
03:42:09,700 --> 03:42:11,684
MATT: He's already up against the wall.

3366
03:42:11,684 --> 03:42:16,298
TALIESIN: All right. Second, I'll take a spine
devil, the one that's threatening

3367
03:42:16,298 --> 03:42:18,207
the most people?

3368
03:42:18,207 --> 03:42:21,348
SAM: That song is not called "Doo-Bop." It's
called "Mmmbop."

3369
03:42:21,423 --> 03:42:23,885
LAURA: That's what I said.

3370
03:42:23,885 --> 03:42:27,390
TALIESIN: 25.

3371
03:42:27,390 --> 03:42:29,218
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

3372
03:42:29,218 --> 03:42:37,717
TALIESIN: That's not the damage. Oh yeah. 17
points of damage and six points

3373
03:42:37,717 --> 03:42:40,113
of psychic damage.

3374
03:42:40,113 --> 03:42:44,094
MATT: You scatter one of the spine devils with one
shot. Blasts apart.

3375
03:42:44,094 --> 03:42:55,822
TALIESIN: The other one, I'm going to spend a
point for Grit for deadeye, just to get

3376
03:42:55,822 --> 03:42:56,751
advantage.

3377
03:42:56,751 --> 03:42:59,546
MATT: Go for it.

3378
03:42:59,546 --> 03:43:06,698
TALIESIN: That's cocked. 29?

3379
03:43:06,698 --> 03:43:09,322
MATT: 29 hits.

3380
03:43:09,322 --> 03:43:14,810
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage and one point of
psychic?

3381
03:43:14,810 --> 03:43:16,386
MATT: Okay.

3382
03:43:16,386 --> 03:43:17,660
TALIESIN: He's still standing?

3383
03:43:17,660 --> 03:43:18,686
MATT: Still standing.

3384
03:43:18,686 --> 03:43:19,809
TALIESIN: Action surge.

3385
03:43:19,809 --> 03:43:21,128
LIAM: Yes!

3386
03:43:21,128 --> 03:43:22,339
TALIESIN: Three more shots.

3387
03:43:22,339 --> 03:43:23,742
SAM: Three more?

3388
03:43:23,742 --> 03:43:27,212
TALIESIN: Hitting him again. Same thing, with a
Grit.

3389
03:43:27,392 --> 03:43:29,249
MATT: All right.

3390
03:43:29,249 --> 03:43:33,677
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good to do. 24 to hit?

3391
03:43:33,677 --> 03:43:38,094
MATT: Hits. This is against the second spine
devil, yeah.

3392
03:43:38,094 --> 03:43:41,626
TALIESIN: That's 11 points of damage and four
psychic.

3393
03:43:41,626 --> 03:43:43,356
MATT: He scatters.

3394
03:43:43,356 --> 03:43:51,492
TALIESIN: Third spine devil. Same thing--
actually, I get my Grit back. Third spine devil.

3395
03:43:51,552 --> 03:43:54,321
MATT: These shots are (gunshots).

3396
03:43:54,321 --> 03:43:59,020
TALIESIN: Yeah, actually, I'll reroll the cocked
one, but it doesn't matter. Yeah. That hits.

3397
03:43:59,020 --> 03:44:04,924
MATT: Echoing through the hall. Everyone who is
ever searching for anything knows exactly where to

3398
03:44:04,924 --> 03:44:05,907
go now.

3399
03:44:05,907 --> 03:44:08,933
TALIESIN: Yeah, fuck it. It's worth it, though. 13
points of damage and five psychic.

3400
03:44:08,933 --> 03:44:12,429
MATT: Okay. Still standing, but looking rough.

3401
03:44:12,429 --> 03:44:26,218
TALIESIN: And another shot, same thing, with
advantage. That's fine. 24?

3402
03:44:26,218 --> 03:44:28,989
MATT: 24. Yep.

3403
03:44:28,989 --> 03:44:36,170
TALIESIN: Thank god they're easy to hit. That's 16
points of damage and four psychic.

3404
03:44:36,170 --> 03:44:40,944
MATT: The third spine devil's upper torso is
disintegrated by the blast. Its wings flick off to

3405
03:44:40,944 --> 03:44:43,713
its sides, spattering part of the bone devil.

3406
03:44:43,713 --> 03:44:49,546
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend my last Grit. Last
Grit is a shot to the spine devil.

3407
03:44:49,546 --> 03:44:53,634
MATT: That was already three attacks. That was
three more attacks.

3408
03:44:53,634 --> 03:44:55,366
TALIESIN: That was one, two--

3409
03:44:55,366 --> 03:44:59,626
MATT: Yeah, you killed the second one, and then
shot twice to kill a third one. So you're out of

3410
03:44:59,626 --> 03:45:00,860
attacks.

3411
03:45:00,860 --> 03:45:02,756
TALIESIN: I'm done. Reload, and that's the end of
my turn.

3412
03:45:02,756 --> 03:45:07,285
MATT: All righty. At this point, you guys can hear
distant yelling getting louder and louder down the

3413
03:45:07,285 --> 03:45:12,360
hallway where you came from. You hear the voices
echoing and swarming, and people are starting to

3414
03:45:12,360 --> 03:45:15,298
get closer, knowing where you are. Tova, you're
up.

3415
03:45:15,298 --> 03:45:18,772
NOELLE: How many of these devil-guys are left?

3416
03:45:18,772 --> 03:45:20,761
MATT: There's just the one bone devil left.

3417
03:45:20,761 --> 03:45:24,898
NOELLE: Okay. I'm going to run back a full 45
feet. How close can I get to him?

3418
03:45:24,898 --> 03:45:29,112
MATT: 45? You can get about there. You're about
ten, 15 feet from him. Ten feet.

3419
03:45:29,112 --> 03:45:30,863
LIAM: You got any projectile shit?

3420
03:45:30,863 --> 03:45:32,240
NOELLE: I do not.

3421
03:45:32,240 --> 03:45:35,226
TALIESIN: Need to heal?

3422
03:45:35,226 --> 03:45:38,537
NOELLE: That would help.

3423
03:45:38,537 --> 03:45:40,343
TALIESIN: Do you have anything to heal with?

3424
03:45:40,343 --> 03:45:41,570
(laughter)

3425
03:45:41,570 --> 03:45:42,543
NOELLE: Don't think so.

3426
03:45:42,543 --> 03:45:44,612
TRAVIS: You hungry? Yeah. You have any food?

3427
03:45:44,612 --> 03:45:46,861
(laughter)

3428
03:45:46,861 --> 03:45:51,715
NOELLE: Who's closest to me, here?

3429
03:45:51,715 --> 03:45:57,084
MATT: Currently, it's Vax, the half-elf rogue
guy.

3430
03:45:57,084 --> 03:46:00,069
NOELLE: Can I save my action?

3431
03:46:00,069 --> 03:46:01,829
MATT: You could.

3432
03:46:01,829 --> 03:46:03,023
NOELLE: Yeah.

3433
03:46:03,023 --> 03:46:05,636
MATT: Yeah, because you haven't had a short rest,
so you don't have your blood curses back, yeah.

3434
03:46:05,636 --> 03:46:07,330
NOELLE: Yeah, no, I don't have--

3435
03:46:07,330 --> 03:46:09,734
MATT: Okay. So you're just going to hold your
action just in case it comes near?

3436
03:46:09,734 --> 03:46:12,122
NOELLE: Yeah, I'll just hang out with my new
friends here.

3437
03:46:12,122 --> 03:46:13,989
MATT: Okay. Sounds good. Grog.

3438
03:46:13,989 --> 03:46:16,168
TRAVIS: Go running in 50 feet. (war cry)

3439
03:46:16,168 --> 03:46:20,994
MATT: 50 feet puts you standing over Keyleth,
pretty much.

3440
03:46:20,994 --> 03:46:23,058
TRAVIS: Am I in melee distance?

3441
03:46:23,058 --> 03:46:24,343
MATT: You are in melee distance.

3442
03:46:24,343 --> 03:46:25,533
TRAVIS: Reckless attacks!

3443
03:46:25,533 --> 03:46:28,316
LAURA: Yes, kill it so we can run away.

3444
03:46:28,316 --> 03:46:31,063
TRAVIS: 29.

3445
03:46:31,063 --> 03:46:32,736
MATT: You do have a point of exhaustion, by the
way.

3446
03:46:32,736 --> 03:46:33,849
TRAVIS: Yes.

3447
03:46:33,849 --> 03:46:35,124
MATT: 29 hits.

3448
03:46:35,124 --> 03:46:37,285
TRAVIS: 24 points.

3449
03:46:37,285 --> 03:46:39,321
MATT: 24 points of damage, all righty.

3450
03:46:39,321 --> 03:46:41,711
TRAVIS: Second one, reckless. Natural 20.

3451
03:46:41,711 --> 03:46:44,294
ALL: Oh!

3452
03:46:44,294 --> 03:46:46,818
LIAM: From the gods.

3453
03:46:46,818 --> 03:46:48,666
MARISHA: Yes, from the gods.

3454
03:46:48,666 --> 03:46:55,602
TRAVIS: 24, 27, 34. 34 points of damage.

3455
03:46:55,602 --> 03:46:57,612
MATT: Well, did you double the dice?

3456
03:46:57,612 --> 03:47:00,462
TRAVIS: Did two additional damage dice rolls.

3457
03:47:00,462 --> 03:47:04,091
MATT: Right, so you did the first one--

3458
03:47:04,091 --> 03:47:06,422
TRAVIS: Initial one, and then I did two more
d10s.

3459
03:47:06,422 --> 03:47:08,179
MATT: Okay, so the total was?

3460
03:47:08,179 --> 03:47:08,985
TRAVIS: 34.

3461
03:47:08,985 --> 03:47:10,931
MATT: 34. All righty.

3462
03:47:10,931 --> 03:47:12,628
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I have two levels of brutal
critical.

3463
03:47:12,628 --> 03:47:13,988
MATT: Great, so those are your two attacks.

3464
03:47:13,988 --> 03:47:14,931
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3465
03:47:14,931 --> 03:47:18,539
MATT: All right. That brings us to the bone
devil's turn.

3466
03:47:18,539 --> 03:47:19,921
LAURA: Oh, he's still alive?

3467
03:47:19,921 --> 03:47:30,370
MATT: Yeah, he's still alive. And seeing
everybody rush in and help this wounded creature

3468
03:47:30,370 --> 03:47:32,688
on the ground--

3469
03:47:32,688 --> 03:47:37,812
NOELLE: Matt? Can I-- sorry, keep going.

3470
03:47:37,812 --> 03:47:40,686
MATT: Okay. You sure?

3471
03:47:40,686 --> 03:47:45,019
NOELLE: Can I use the blood curses-- I can use it
three times per short rest, so I have one more,

3472
03:47:45,019 --> 03:47:49,408
right? I did two in the prison.

3473
03:47:49,408 --> 03:47:51,454
MATT: Two Mutual Suffering, and you did your
Mark.

3474
03:47:51,454 --> 03:47:54,753
NOELLE: Oh, you're right, okay. You're right. Did
three. Sorry. Carry on.

3475
03:47:54,753 --> 03:48:01,073
MATT: It's all good. All right, so. It's going to
go ahead-- actually, no, let me roll to see

3476
03:48:01,073 --> 03:48:05,662
which way it goes. Okay, yeah, it's not that
intelligent. So intelligence check, you being the

3477
03:48:05,732 --> 03:48:08,785
immediate threat, it turns attention towards you
as opposed to Keyleth, who's currently on the

3478
03:48:08,785 --> 03:48:14,154
ground. As you're the biggest threat to it at the
moment, it's going to go ahead and make three

3479
03:48:14,154 --> 03:48:16,380
strikes at you. That is 16?

3480
03:48:16,380 --> 03:48:18,450
TRAVIS: Misses!

3481
03:48:18,450 --> 03:48:21,094
MATT: 16?

3482
03:48:21,284 --> 03:48:22,620
TRAVIS: Misses!

3483
03:48:22,620 --> 03:48:23,874
MARISHA: Come on, Grog!

3484
03:48:23,874 --> 03:48:24,719
MATT: 17.

3485
03:48:24,719 --> 03:48:25,692
TRAVIS: Hits!

3486
03:48:25,692 --> 03:48:37,115
MATT: Ah, finally. Eight, eight, nine. (laughs)
All right. That is 16 points of piercing damage,

3487
03:48:37,115 --> 03:48:40,993
and no poison because you are immune.

3488
03:48:40,993 --> 03:48:42,815
TRAVIS: Word.

3489
03:48:42,815 --> 03:48:49,088
MATT: All right. That ends its turn, and it's
going to shift over, flying over onto this way,

3490
03:48:49,088 --> 03:48:53,403
the coasting in the center there, and getting over
Keyleth, getting closer to the blood pool--

3491
03:48:53,403 --> 03:48:55,703
TRAVIS: May I make a retali--

3492
03:48:55,703 --> 03:48:59,347
MATT: Retaliation? Yes, you can. As a reaction,
you can.

3493
03:48:59,347 --> 03:49:01,543
MARISHA: Come on, kill it!

3494
03:49:01,543 --> 03:49:07,445
TRAVIS: Reckless, please. 30.

3495
03:49:07,445 --> 03:49:09,131
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

3496
03:49:09,131 --> 03:49:12,667
TRAVIS: Yeah. 24.

3497
03:49:12,667 --> 03:49:22,024
MATT: 24 points of damage. As it flies over you
through the air, you arc in the direction with

3498
03:49:22,024 --> 03:49:28,719
your hammer, and as you do, it breaks its entire
ribcage inward. You hear the shattering of bones,

3499
03:49:28,719 --> 03:49:34,147
and it gives out this wheeze as you follow through
and slam it back down where it was standing.

3500
03:49:34,147 --> 03:49:36,550
TRAVIS: Sweet!

3501
03:49:36,550 --> 03:49:38,723
(cheering)

3502
03:49:38,723 --> 03:49:40,674
LAURA: Keyleth, can you do a Wall of Stone?

3503
03:49:40,674 --> 03:49:43,176
MARISHA: Yeah, into the corridor.

3504
03:49:43,176 --> 03:49:45,586
LAURA: Yeah, block it!

3505
03:49:45,586 --> 03:49:47,825
TRAVIS: Do it here so they don't know which way we
went.

3506
03:49:47,825 --> 03:49:50,431
SAM: They know the layout of this prison.

3507
03:49:50,431 --> 03:49:52,616
TRAVIS: Yeah, but they don't know which direction
we went.

3508
03:49:52,616 --> 03:49:56,499
MATT: You guys hear voices now coming from the
other sides, as well.

3509
03:49:56,499 --> 03:50:05,178
SAM: Let me do something. I'm going to use my
Scroll of Programmed Illusion.

3510
03:50:05,178 --> 03:50:06,769
MATT: Okay.

3511
03:50:06,769 --> 03:50:11,284
SAM: Have any creatures talked to us in Common
down here? With their mouths, not with their

3512
03:50:11,284 --> 03:50:12,375
minds?

3513
03:50:12,375 --> 03:50:13,546
MATT: There have been a handful, yeah.

3514
03:50:13,546 --> 03:50:14,740
SAM: What kind?

3515
03:50:14,740 --> 03:50:19,737
MATT: They've been the cambion, the guy you met
earlier with the red skin who made the deal with

3516
03:50:19,737 --> 03:50:20,759
Percival.

3517
03:50:20,759 --> 03:50:21,738
TRAVIS: The chain devil.

3518
03:50:21,738 --> 03:50:22,633
MATT: The chain devil spoke Common.

3519
03:50:22,633 --> 03:50:23,633
SAM: Okay. Did he work in the prison?

3520
03:50:23,633 --> 03:50:24,675
MATT: The chain devil did.

3521
03:50:24,675 --> 03:50:30,646
SAM: Great, chain devil. So I'm going to make a
Programmed Illusion. Upon anyone approaching, a

3522
03:50:30,646 --> 03:50:36,837
chain devil will appear over the dead bodies that
we just killed and say, "There were five of them.

3523
03:50:36,911 --> 03:50:42,019
"They went that way!" And point down the hallway
that we just came out of. "Go, get them now! Make

3524
03:50:42,019 --> 03:50:43,452
"them pay!"

3525
03:50:43,452 --> 03:50:46,640
(cheering)

3526
03:50:46,640 --> 03:50:51,330
MATT: All righty. As you pull the scroll out, and
you watch the scroll burst into flame as you

3527
03:50:51,330 --> 03:50:56,860
finish the incantation, you watch as out of the
blood pool, rising, this chain devil, looking

3528
03:50:56,860 --> 03:51:02,922
real, material, steps up and walks over to the
bodies and sits there looking over them, waiting

3529
03:51:02,922 --> 03:51:04,496
for someone to trigger.

3530
03:51:04,496 --> 03:51:07,816
LAURA: Okay, we should put Dust of Tracelessness
down. Dust of Tracelessness on the ground!

3531
03:51:07,816 --> 03:51:09,972
MATT: Okay, you start flower girling your way.

3532
03:51:09,972 --> 03:51:14,023
MARISHA: I hold my Wall of Stone, since he has
that, because I don't want to make it apparent.

3533
03:51:14,023 --> 03:51:24,028
MATT: Get this map out if we can? Okay, so you
guys continue to the right. Thank you. And bring

3534
03:51:24,028 --> 03:51:29,366
the last one in. You guys head down this hallway
for about another hundred feet, hearing the shouts

3535
03:51:29,366 --> 03:51:32,718
behind. You hear conversation, different languages
happening. They're getting a little more distant.

3536
03:51:32,718 --> 03:51:37,637
You're catching some ground here, and it's going
well. Eventually you make your way--

3537
03:51:37,637 --> 03:51:39,787
SAM: Jesus, there's another whole fucking map?

3538
03:51:39,787 --> 03:51:42,435
MARISHA: The doors, always. This is Matt Mercer
we're talking about.

3539
03:51:42,435 --> 03:51:44,830
LIAM: I'm looking for fucking traps.

3540
03:51:44,830 --> 03:51:49,786
MATT: You guys make your way down to the end of
this chamber, and you see three different doors

3541
03:51:49,786 --> 03:51:53,361
that are all closed off, to the front, to the
right, and the left.

3542
03:51:53,361 --> 03:51:54,501
LIAM: Fanged smiles.

3543
03:51:54,501 --> 03:51:56,223
LAURA: Fanged smile.

3544
03:51:56,223 --> 03:52:03,193
MATT: As you're making your investigation check,
you hear what sounds like the writhing of chains

3545
03:52:03,193 --> 03:52:09,276
and the pulling of heavy metal grinding. As you
begin to look and inspect the doors real fast, you

3546
03:52:09,276 --> 03:52:16,216
glance up, and the entire ceiling is a sea of
rolling chains, all gathering, and then from the

3547
03:52:16,216 --> 03:52:19,340
ceiling bursts down in the center of the
chamber--

3548
03:52:19,340 --> 03:52:22,412
(yelling)

3549
03:52:22,412 --> 03:52:29,215
MATT: A chain golem slams into the center, its
glowing red eyes from underneath. All right. As

3550
03:52:29,215 --> 03:52:34,157
you guys have all scattered amongst these chambers
you ran down, Vax just rushed up and began to

3551
03:52:34,157 --> 03:52:37,353
inspect these here. What are you guys doing?

3552
03:52:37,353 --> 03:52:42,785
MARISHA: Wait, is this it? Is this where we're
supposed to be?

3553
03:52:42,785 --> 03:52:44,845
TALIESIN: We've got to find out which room he's
in.

3554
03:52:44,845 --> 03:52:48,197
MATT: All right. Everyone roll initiative.

3555
03:52:48,197 --> 03:52:53,024
TRAVIS: Oh my god. What size is that thing?

3556
03:52:53,024 --> 03:53:00,384
MATT: It's almost 20 feet tall, and when it slams
the ground, it's hunched forward. If it were

3557
03:53:00,384 --> 03:53:02,835
standing upright, it would scrape the ceiling.

3558
03:53:02,835 --> 03:53:04,751
TRAVIS: So it's fire giant size.

3559
03:53:04,751 --> 03:53:08,172
MATT: A little bit under fire giant size, but you
watch the chains from the ceiling are still

3560
03:53:08,172 --> 03:53:14,389
attached to it. It's like the whole ceiling and
upper portion of this chamber is made of chains

3561
03:53:14,389 --> 03:53:16,036
that are feeding it.

3562
03:53:16,036 --> 03:53:17,772
LAURA: Do we have anything to freeze?

3563
03:53:17,772 --> 03:53:24,226
MARISHA: To freeze? Yeah. We have our shit back,
right?

3564
03:53:24,226 --> 03:53:25,577
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3565
03:53:25,577 --> 03:53:29,085
LAURA: If we can freeze him in place, maybe. He's
made of metal.

3566
03:53:29,085 --> 03:53:30,205
MATT: 25 to 20.

3567
03:53:30,205 --> 03:53:31,031
LAURA: 24.

3568
03:53:31,031 --> 03:53:31,764
MATT: 24.

3569
03:53:31,764 --> 03:53:32,860
NOELLE: 21.

3570
03:53:32,860 --> 03:53:38,032
MATT: Tova. And what did you roll for your
investigation check earlier?

3571
03:53:38,032 --> 03:53:39,370
LIAM: Oh, 22.

3572
03:53:39,370 --> 03:53:43,632
MATT: 22. This doorway, the first one you checked?
Does not seem to have-- the symbol on it appears

3573
03:53:43,632 --> 03:53:52,137
to be some sort of Infernal symbol that you don't
recognize. All right. 20 to 15?

3574
03:53:52,137 --> 03:53:53,908
MARISHA: 17.

3575
03:53:53,908 --> 03:53:55,004
TALIESIN: 15.

3576
03:53:55,004 --> 03:54:02,324
MATT: 15 to ten?

3577
03:54:02,324 --> 03:54:04,816
TRAVIS: 13.

3578
03:54:04,816 --> 03:54:06,584
MATT: Taryon?

3579
03:54:06,584 --> 03:54:07,856
SAM: Two.

3580
03:54:07,856 --> 03:54:09,614
TRAVIS: Wow.

3581
03:54:09,614 --> 03:54:12,253
LIAM: Eight for Vax.

3582
03:54:12,253 --> 03:54:14,967
MATT: All right. Vex, you're up first.

3583
03:54:14,967 --> 03:54:17,572
LAURA: Can I run to the other doors that Vax has
been looking at?

3584
03:54:17,572 --> 03:54:19,131
MATT: Which one of these are you checking?

3585
03:54:19,131 --> 03:54:19,904
LAURA: Huh?

3586
03:54:19,904 --> 03:54:20,995
MATT: Which one of these doors are you checking?

3587
03:54:20,995 --> 03:54:23,719
LAURA: The far one in the back. Yeah. And I'll
look for the symbol.

3588
03:54:23,719 --> 03:54:25,757
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3589
03:54:25,757 --> 03:54:32,650
LAURA: 23.

3590
03:54:32,650 --> 03:54:37,216
MATT: 23. You go and look up, and this one has a
symbol that looks like a half-moon that is broken

3591
03:54:37,216 --> 03:54:39,265
and is bleeding into a pool below it.

3592
03:54:39,265 --> 03:54:41,484
LAURA: And I'm looking for a fanged grin?

3593
03:54:41,484 --> 03:54:48,317
MATT: It's a crescent half-moon that looks like
it's broken in the middle.

3594
03:54:48,317 --> 03:54:51,291
LAURA: That totally could be a fanged grin. Okay.

3595
03:54:51,291 --> 03:54:52,655
SAM: Which one?

3596
03:54:52,655 --> 03:54:55,295
LAURA: The very back door.

3597
03:54:55,295 --> 03:55:00,915
MATT: This one and this one have been inspected.
So that's your movement to get up there. And your

3598
03:55:00,915 --> 03:55:07,032
action to look thoroughly and look at the symbol
in the low light. You have a bonus still.

3599
03:55:07,032 --> 03:55:09,505
LAURA: Yeah. Is it possible to bonus hide?

3600
03:55:09,505 --> 03:55:13,458
MATT: You have nowhere to hide from. You have
nothing obscuring.

3601
03:55:13,458 --> 03:55:15,167
LAURA: Nothing to obscure the view?

3602
03:55:15,167 --> 03:55:16,295
MATT: Not really.

3603
03:55:16,295 --> 03:55:18,529
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus to pop
Trinket out.

3604
03:55:18,529 --> 03:55:21,286
MATT: Okay. Trinket appears out of your necklace.

3605
03:55:21,286 --> 03:55:25,120
LAURA: I guess he was already out, wasn't he?
Because we were running.

3606
03:55:25,120 --> 03:55:27,348
MATT: Yeah, but you may have pulled him back in.
It's fine.

3607
03:55:27,348 --> 03:55:33,753
LAURA: That's a waste of bonus. (laughs) No, I'm
going to Hunter's Mark. So Trinket was out. I'm

3608
03:55:33,753 --> 03:55:35,213
going to Hunter's Mark the guy.

3609
03:55:35,213 --> 03:55:39,227
MATT: All right, I'll go with it. Hunter's Mark on
the chain golem. Tova, your turn.

3610
03:55:39,227 --> 03:55:48,769
NOELLE: Okay. I'm going to run over there behind
the chain golem where Vex is. I'm going to do a

3611
03:55:48,769 --> 03:55:52,739
perception check. I guess I'll check out this last
door.

3612
03:55:52,739 --> 03:55:53,895
MATT: Okay.

3613
03:55:53,895 --> 03:55:57,800
NOELLE: Can I do a general sense of smell for the
whole area and see if I smell anything coming from

3614
03:55:57,800 --> 03:55:59,689
any of these prisons?

3615
03:55:59,689 --> 03:56:03,333
MATT: Sure. Make a perception check as you're
rushing in.

3616
03:56:03,333 --> 03:56:05,303
LAURA: What about symbols? Do you see anything?

3617
03:56:05,303 --> 03:56:06,739
MATT: With advantage.

3618
03:56:06,739 --> 03:56:15,756
NOELLE: Yep. All right. So that is a 23.

3619
03:56:15,756 --> 03:56:21,312
MATT: 23. The chambers seem to have various scents
that kind of mix in this area. The one on the far

3620
03:56:21,312 --> 03:56:26,972
end has this ancient, dusty, decay smell to it.
The one on the opposite side of the chamber has a

3621
03:56:26,972 --> 03:56:35,191
weirdly iron, rusty old metal scent, and the
doorway that you're at right now has a very strong

3622
03:56:35,191 --> 03:56:36,719
scent of sulfur.

3623
03:56:36,719 --> 03:56:38,813
NOELLE: Is there anything on the door?

3624
03:56:38,813 --> 03:56:41,412
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3625
03:56:41,412 --> 03:56:47,349
NOELLE: Where's investigation? That's an 18.

3626
03:56:47,349 --> 03:56:51,871
MATT: You knock the dust from the side, and as you
inspect closely, hearing the chains grinding and

3627
03:56:51,871 --> 03:56:55,752
spinning around you, and occasionally you duck
because you see one kind of whip across and break

3628
03:56:55,752 --> 03:57:03,298
part of the stone and cause chunks of it to fly
off. You look down, and you see two small eyes and

3629
03:57:03,298 --> 03:57:05,714
one deep, toothy grin.

3630
03:57:05,714 --> 03:57:07,853
NOELLE: Hey, this one's smiling!

3631
03:57:07,853 --> 03:57:12,200
LAURA: But is it a fanged grin? A fanged grin is
usually cocked. But it looks more--

3632
03:57:12,200 --> 03:57:23,621
NOELLE: He doesn't appear sincere, so. What do I
have left?

3633
03:57:23,621 --> 03:57:27,820
MATT: Well, as a note, just remember this, it took
you a while to get there because the chains that

3634
03:57:27,820 --> 03:57:31,286
were rolling around it are entangling and wrapping
around the area, so you were at half movement,

3635
03:57:31,364 --> 03:57:35,129
which got you just to there. I forgot to mention
that earlier. However, the chains, in the process,

3636
03:57:35,187 --> 03:57:41,156
are crushing and doing damage as you move through
them. Six points of bludgeoning damage to you as

3637
03:57:41,156 --> 03:57:46,738
you pull your way through the chains getting to
that area. All right, that ends Tova's turn. It is

3638
03:57:46,738 --> 03:57:48,323
now the chain golem's turn.

3639
03:57:48,323 --> 03:57:49,792
NOELLE: Do I have an extra action or anything?

3640
03:57:49,792 --> 03:57:52,154
MATT: Your action was to do the investigation. You
have your bonus, if you have something to spend it

3641
03:57:52,154 --> 03:57:53,367
with.

3642
03:57:53,367 --> 03:57:54,934
NOELLE: Turn into a bear?

3643
03:57:54,934 --> 03:57:55,957
MATT: Sure.

3644
03:57:55,957 --> 03:57:57,687
LAURA: (laughs) "I turn into a bear?"

3645
03:57:57,687 --> 03:58:06,079
MATT: And bear form. (sings) And bear form. There
is your bear form. All righty. So ending Tova's

3646
03:58:06,079 --> 03:58:16,030
turn, it is now the golem's turn. The golem has a
ten-foot range on its slam. It's going to do two

3647
03:58:16,030 --> 03:58:21,838
slam attacks. It's going to reach out and slam
once at Percy, who is within its front range there

3648
03:58:21,838 --> 03:58:25,219
after landing, and Keyleth, who's immediately to
its left.

3649
03:58:25,219 --> 03:58:27,030
LAURA: Don't fucking die, Keyleth.

3650
03:58:27,030 --> 03:58:31,717
MATT: A physical slam attack. A giant
battering-ram of heavy, thick chains are going to

3651
03:58:31,717 --> 03:58:38,205
punch out towards Percival. The fist swings, and
almost merges with the rest of the body as a

3652
03:58:38,205 --> 03:58:42,708
second arm forms where it was and then backfists
into Keyleth. Like its form shifts with the chains

3653
03:58:42,708 --> 03:58:48,538
that move around within its body, and its form is
ever-changing and shifting, like a giant amoeba of

3654
03:58:48,538 --> 03:58:53,613
moving metal. The first attack towards Percival.
That is 27 to hit.

3655
03:58:53,613 --> 03:58:55,286
TALIESIN: Oh my god, yes.

3656
03:58:55,286 --> 03:59:08,912
MATT: All right. You suffer 22 points of
bludgeoning damage. And against Keyleth, that is a

3657
03:59:08,912 --> 03:59:10,439
25 to hit.

3658
03:59:10,439 --> 03:59:11,526
MARISHA: Yep.

3659
03:59:11,526 --> 03:59:16,103
MATT: Keyleth, you take 21 points of bludgeoning
damage.

3660
03:59:16,103 --> 03:59:18,327
SAM: Is Sanctuary still working on her?

3661
03:59:18,327 --> 03:59:24,650
MATT: Actually, Sanctuary is on. Has to make a
wisdom saving throw before it can do that. Which

3662
03:59:24,650 --> 03:59:26,659
it fails! You take no damage.

3663
03:59:26,659 --> 03:59:28,861
(cheering)

3664
03:59:28,861 --> 03:59:31,631
MATT: It rolled a two and had a zero wisdom
modifier.

3665
03:59:31,631 --> 03:59:34,667
MARISHA: Oh, that's good, that's great.

3666
03:59:34,667 --> 03:59:41,433
MATT: So as it goes to strike you, the second fist
appears and then seems to dwindle and fall to the

3667
03:59:41,433 --> 03:59:45,118
ground, and it forms again in the spot where it
was. You watch as multiple arms are now forming

3668
03:59:45,118 --> 03:59:51,715
and coming out of it at different places. It's
going to back up. As it does so, its eyes shift.

3669
03:59:51,715 --> 03:59:57,410
These two red, beady points of light that form its
eyes kind of shift to the back of its head, and

3670
03:59:57,410 --> 04:00:02,318
now you see they're almost moving around, and it's
keeping a visual range of everything in the room.

3671
04:00:02,318 --> 04:00:05,578
TALIESIN: Do I get an attack of opportunity since
we're moving out of its combat range?

3672
04:00:05,578 --> 04:00:11,635
MATT: No. It was not in your combat range. It had
reach, unfortunately. That ends its turn. Keyleth,

3673
04:00:11,635 --> 04:00:13,088
you're up.

3674
04:00:13,088 --> 04:00:22,039
MARISHA: Okay. I need to stay alive. Who's close
to me in a 30-foot radius? And who's looking

3675
04:00:22,039 --> 04:00:23,345
rough?

3676
04:00:23,345 --> 04:00:24,353
TRAVIS: You.

3677
04:00:24,353 --> 04:00:27,891
MATT: Everyone but Vex and Trinket are in a
30-foot radius.

3678
04:00:27,891 --> 04:00:33,518
MARISHA: Okay. I want to start backing out a
little bit, and who's lowest on hit points?

3679
04:00:33,518 --> 04:00:34,637
Legit.

3680
04:00:34,637 --> 04:00:36,032
LAURA AND LIAM: You.

3681
04:00:36,032 --> 04:00:37,617
NOELLE: I have 19 hit points left.

3682
04:00:37,617 --> 04:00:39,156
SAM: And me.

3683
04:00:39,156 --> 04:00:45,222
MARISHA: Me, Tova, Taryon, and I can pick three
more people. I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds.

3684
04:00:45,222 --> 04:00:46,808
TALIESIN: Who else wants it?

3685
04:00:46,808 --> 04:00:49,036
LIAM: I'll take it. I'm at like two-thirds, I
guess?

3686
04:00:49,036 --> 04:00:50,347
MARISHA: Vax.

3687
04:00:50,347 --> 04:00:52,949
TALIESIN: Grog, you want it?

3688
04:00:52,949 --> 04:00:55,217
MARISHA: Anyone else looking relatively low?

3689
04:00:55,217 --> 04:00:57,213
TRAVIS: No, I'm not relatively low.

3690
04:00:57,213 --> 04:00:59,545
LAURA: If you can do it to everybody, why not?

3691
04:00:59,545 --> 04:01:01,057
MARISHA: I can do it to six people.

3692
04:01:01,057 --> 04:01:03,969
TALIESIN: So we've got, one, two, three, four.
I'll say yes.

3693
04:01:03,969 --> 04:01:05,165
LAURA: And Grog.

3694
04:01:05,165 --> 04:01:15,264
MARISHA: And Grog. And we're going to do a Mass
Cure Wounds. 3d8 plus my spellcasting ability.

3695
04:01:15,264 --> 04:01:16,361
Okay.

3696
04:01:16,361 --> 04:01:19,063
MATT: Yep, so 3d8 plus six. Go for it. Percy,
you're up next.

3697
04:01:19,063 --> 04:01:24,114
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's amazing. Oh, that's a
one.

3698
04:01:24,114 --> 04:01:25,661
SAM: You can reroll ones.

3699
04:01:25,661 --> 04:01:34,071
MARISHA: No, only if it's elemental damage. Eight,
16, 17 plus six.

3700
04:01:34,071 --> 04:01:35,422
MATT: Six, so 23.

3701
04:01:35,422 --> 04:01:36,897
MARISHA: 23 points.

3702
04:01:36,897 --> 04:01:40,051
MATT: 23 points of healing. So mark that in, guys.
That's your action.

3703
04:01:40,051 --> 04:01:44,155
MARISHA: And then I'm backing out a little bit.

3704
04:01:44,155 --> 04:01:45,828
MATT: Backing this way or this way?

3705
04:01:45,828 --> 04:01:50,428
MARISHA: Yeah, away from the chain golem. Yeah.
That way.

3706
04:01:50,428 --> 04:01:53,731
MATT: This way. If you move one more, he's going
to get attack of opportunity on you because you're

3707
04:01:53,731 --> 04:01:55,100
within melee range of him right now.

3708
04:01:55,100 --> 04:01:56,536
MARISHA: Fucking hell.

3709
04:01:56,536 --> 04:01:59,166
MATT: You want to risk it? Or not?

3710
04:01:59,166 --> 04:02:05,223
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll risk it.

3711
04:02:05,223 --> 04:02:06,356
MATT: Okay.

3712
04:02:06,356 --> 04:02:08,227
LAURA: Can you transform anymore or are you
spent?

3713
04:02:08,227 --> 04:02:10,986
MARISHA: I can do it one more time, but only to an
animal, not an elemental.

3714
04:02:10,986 --> 04:02:18,207
MATT: Okay, so you back up. It takes a swing at
you with its chain slam. That is 26 to hit.

3715
04:02:18,207 --> 04:02:19,486
MARISHA: Yep.

3716
04:02:19,486 --> 04:02:20,880
MATT: You take--

3717
04:02:20,880 --> 04:02:24,807
SAM: Is Sanctuary still on her?

3718
04:02:24,807 --> 04:02:26,188
MATT: 30 points of bludgeoning damage.

3719
04:02:26,188 --> 04:02:27,429
TALIESIN and LAURA: Sanctuary.

3720
04:02:27,429 --> 04:02:32,222
MATT: Sanctuary. Thank you for reminding me. That
is a 14.

3721
04:02:32,222 --> 04:02:33,603
MARISHA: Miss!

3722
04:02:33,603 --> 04:02:35,555
MATT: What's your DC? 17?

3723
04:02:35,555 --> 04:02:37,075
SAM: On what? My spell DC?

3724
04:02:37,075 --> 04:02:38,068
MATT: Yeah, spell DC.

3725
04:02:38,068 --> 04:02:39,055
SAM: 17.

3726
04:02:39,055 --> 04:02:44,181
MATT: 17. It goes to swing again towards you as a
reaction and the magic prevents it from actually

3727
04:02:44,181 --> 04:02:46,480
hitting its mark and the chains retract back into
its body.

3728
04:02:46,480 --> 04:02:47,531
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3729
04:02:47,531 --> 04:02:48,724
MATT: So no damage is sustained.

3730
04:02:48,724 --> 04:02:50,338
SAM: Matt, if I may be--

3731
04:02:50,338 --> 04:02:52,627
LAURA: No.

3732
04:02:52,627 --> 04:02:55,266
SAM: Technically, he can choose another target.

3733
04:02:55,266 --> 04:02:56,472
MARISHA: Are you going to be honest?

3734
04:02:56,472 --> 04:02:57,588
LAURA: Oh, because he failed?

3735
04:02:57,588 --> 04:03:02,948
SAM: No, it just says in Sanctuary you can either
fail or he can choose another target.

3736
04:03:02,948 --> 04:03:05,350
MATT: That's true. All right, so instead--

3737
04:03:05,350 --> 04:03:07,195
SAM: Sorry. Just saying.

3738
04:03:07,195 --> 04:03:11,844
MATT: No, that's good. It'll go to Tova and Vax
for the two attacks that he got Sanctuary earlier.

3739
04:03:11,844 --> 04:03:16,452
So to Vax, that is a 31.

3740
04:03:16,452 --> 04:03:18,644
LIAM: No, that does not hit.

3741
04:03:18,644 --> 04:03:20,519
MATT: So you take the 30 points of damage
instead.

3742
04:03:20,519 --> 04:03:22,463
MARISHA: You're taking it for me?

3743
04:03:22,463 --> 04:03:23,861
LIAM: Yes, I am.

3744
04:03:23,861 --> 04:03:26,396
MARISHA: Thanks, boyfriend!

3745
04:03:26,396 --> 04:03:28,539
MATT: Against Tova that is a natural one.

3746
04:03:28,539 --> 04:03:29,556
NOELLE: That's a what?

3747
04:03:29,556 --> 04:03:32,655
MATT: Natural one to hit you. So it actually slams
into the door above.

3748
04:03:32,655 --> 04:03:34,425
LAURA: Does it break through the door?

3749
04:03:34,425 --> 04:03:36,106
MATT: I'll make a strength check now.

3750
04:03:36,106 --> 04:03:37,388
LIAM: Happy to.

3751
04:03:37,388 --> 04:03:42,902
MATT: The door cracks and it partially gets pushed
inward. Somehow the chain golem actually helped

3752
04:03:42,902 --> 04:03:49,139
you out. That's interesting. All right. That ends
its turn. Keyleth, you're up. No, sorry, that was

3753
04:03:49,139 --> 04:03:50,607
Keyleth's turn. Percy, you're up.

3754
04:03:50,607 --> 04:03:53,974
TALIESIN: I'm out of its range now.

3755
04:03:53,974 --> 04:03:56,250
MATT: You are currently just out of its range.

3756
04:03:56,250 --> 04:04:01,273
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to back up a bit. Move
me behind that-- and then move me--

3757
04:04:01,273 --> 04:04:03,039
the other pillar.

3758
04:04:03,039 --> 04:04:04,130
MATT: Oh, this way?

3759
04:04:04,130 --> 04:04:07,283
TALIESIN: Head that way. Does it look like those
chains are feeding it?

3760
04:04:07,283 --> 04:04:10,932
MATT: It doesn't look like it's feeding it more
than just the chains are keeping it attached to

3761
04:04:10,932 --> 04:04:14,224
the walls. The mass of the chains are still in its
chest.

3762
04:04:14,224 --> 04:04:15,642
TALIESIN: And it has eyeballs.

3763
04:04:15,642 --> 04:04:20,656
MATT: It has some sort of two glowing light
sources within the mass of chains that form where

3764
04:04:20,656 --> 04:04:22,028
its head would be--

3765
04:04:22,028 --> 04:04:24,094
TALIESIN: Would a headshot to those eyeballs
actually be a thing that might work?

3766
04:04:24,094 --> 04:04:25,044
MATT: You can try it.

3767
04:04:25,044 --> 04:04:31,820
TALIESIN: I'm going to try it. I'm going to burn a
thing and see if that does it. So. Yeah. Let's

3768
04:04:31,820 --> 04:04:33,453
find out.

3769
04:04:33,453 --> 04:04:36,146
MATT: You're up next, Grog.

3770
04:04:36,146 --> 04:04:45,003
TALIESIN: Right. Yeah, that'll do. 32 to hit.

3771
04:04:45,062 --> 04:04:46,413
MATT: 32 hits.

3772
04:04:46,496 --> 04:04:53,309
TALIESIN: All right. That's a d10 and d6. That's
11 points of damage and three points of psychic

3773
04:04:53,309 --> 04:04:54,688
damage.

3774
04:04:54,688 --> 04:04:55,821
MATT: Okay.

3775
04:04:55,821 --> 04:04:58,575
TALIESIN: And it has to make a constitution saving
throw.

3776
04:04:58,575 --> 04:05:05,008
MATT: It does not, actually, because it's not
affected by that effect. Its eyes can shift

3777
04:05:05,008 --> 04:05:06,622
throughout its body.

3778
04:05:06,622 --> 04:05:09,005
TALIESIN: There's no snapping, breaking the
glass?

3779
04:05:09,005 --> 04:05:10,210
MATT: Nope.

3780
04:05:10,210 --> 04:05:12,897
TALIESIN: Man, you made me burn a Grit. That
sucks.

3781
04:05:12,959 --> 04:05:16,499
MATT: Yeah. Even with its spell advantage against
all those Sanctuary saves, it just doesn't have a

3782
04:05:16,499 --> 04:05:18,256
very high wisdom so it just cannot make it.

3783
04:05:18,256 --> 04:05:21,427
TALIESIN: That's okay. I'm going to take a
sharpshooter shot at it and just keep damaging it.

3784
04:05:21,427 --> 04:05:23,520
I'm going to do a sharpshooter shot.

3785
04:05:23,520 --> 04:05:24,923
MATT: Two more. Go for it.

3786
04:05:24,923 --> 04:05:25,905
TALIESIN: That was shot one.

3787
04:05:25,905 --> 04:05:27,315
MATT: Shot one. You have two more.

3788
04:05:27,315 --> 04:05:30,874
TALIESIN: Shot two. That's a 25.

3789
04:05:30,874 --> 04:05:32,117
MATT: Hits.

3790
04:05:32,117 --> 04:05:42,891
TALIESIN: That's, ooh. 27 points of damage. And
five psychic.

3791
04:05:42,891 --> 04:05:47,186
MATT: Nice. 32, all righty. Last attack.

3792
04:05:47,186 --> 04:05:53,019
TALIESIN: And another shot, same thing,
sharpshooter. Fuck.

3793
04:05:53,019 --> 04:05:54,629
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cocked.

3794
04:05:54,629 --> 04:05:55,812
SAM: You have too many dice on there.

3795
04:05:55,812 --> 04:06:02,002
TALIESIN: I never do. (groans) Could be worse.
14.

3796
04:06:02,002 --> 04:06:04,136
MATT: 14? Okay.

3797
04:06:04,136 --> 04:06:05,602
TALIESIN: Does 14 hit?

3798
04:06:05,602 --> 04:06:08,387
MATT: 14 does not hit. Sorry, thought that was the
damage. Sorry.

3799
04:06:08,387 --> 04:06:11,968
TALIESIN: Okay. And then I'm going to stay in but
keep an eye on everything that's happening.

3800
04:06:11,968 --> 04:06:15,795
MATT: Yeah. All right. Keyleth, by the way, as you
were moving through the chains-- I forgot to

3801
04:06:15,795 --> 04:06:19,065
mention earlier, as the tangling chains around it.
You did suffer five points of bludgeoning damage

3802
04:06:19,065 --> 04:06:24,049
as the chains are just swirling around and the
aura and the area of its vicinity just shreds like

3803
04:06:24,049 --> 04:06:25,334
a slow-moving grinder.

3804
04:06:25,334 --> 04:06:26,492
MARISHA: As I move out?

3805
04:06:26,492 --> 04:06:27,701
MATT: You're still in there.

3806
04:06:27,701 --> 04:06:32,647
MARISHA: But I healed? Okay. So I'm at 60 points,
right?

3807
04:06:32,647 --> 04:06:34,124
MATT: Grog, you're up.

3808
04:06:34,124 --> 04:06:35,017
LAURA: Get it, Grog.

3809
04:06:35,017 --> 04:06:35,964
TRAVIS: Where am I on the map?

3810
04:06:35,964 --> 04:06:36,772
MATT: Right there.

3811
04:06:36,831 --> 04:06:37,941
LAURA: Ooh, perfect.

3812
04:06:37,941 --> 04:06:39,909
TRAVIS: Yeah, door-- smash it open, right?

3813
04:06:39,909 --> 04:06:42,085
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll an attack.

3814
04:06:42,085 --> 04:06:46,160
TRAVIS: Crack of doom. 23.

3815
04:06:46,160 --> 04:06:47,691
MATT: 23 hits.

3816
04:06:47,691 --> 04:06:49,466
TRAVIS: What do I roll?

3817
04:06:49,466 --> 04:06:51,913
MATT: Just roll damage for your hammer.

3818
04:06:51,913 --> 04:06:56,132
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that makes sense, right? Nine.
25.

3819
04:06:56,132 --> 04:07:03,801
MATT: 25 damage? Becomes 50 because of siege. The
door is absolutely sundered and comes off. Oh god.

3820
04:07:03,801 --> 04:07:10,056
As the door blows open, you glance inside. You can
see within the walls are covered in pulse-y,

3821
04:07:10,056 --> 04:07:15,860
fleshy, muscle-like substance with these long
stretched tendons and pieces of sinew that all

3822
04:07:15,860 --> 04:07:20,704
gather to the center, and you see this shifting
larval egg. And within, you can see a small

3823
04:07:20,704 --> 04:07:24,905
humanoid figure that is swirling and writhing
within. It seems like it's in this perpetual state

3824
04:07:24,905 --> 04:07:29,928
of agony, screaming quietly within this weird
fleshy egg sac and you can see the features of a

3825
04:07:29,928 --> 04:07:34,848
tiger-like face and fangs writhing inside.

3826
04:07:34,848 --> 04:07:37,476
MARISHA: Fucking, umbilical cord.

3827
04:07:37,476 --> 04:07:43,544
TRAVIS: I have one more hit. I'll stride forward
and swing away.

3828
04:07:43,544 --> 04:07:51,443
MATT: Okay. As you step forward, the chain golem
already used its reaction so it cannot. You just

3829
04:07:51,443 --> 04:07:53,542
walk forward. Make an attack.

3830
04:07:53,542 --> 04:07:55,343
TRAVIS: Reckless, please.

3831
04:07:55,343 --> 04:07:57,613
LAURA: Because why not.

3832
04:07:57,613 --> 04:08:02,823
TRAVIS: Because why not. That's a million. It's
32.

3833
04:08:02,823 --> 04:08:03,915
MATT: Roll damage.

3834
04:08:03,915 --> 04:08:05,150
LAURA: A million.

3835
04:08:05,150 --> 04:08:06,409
TALIESIN: Million.

3836
04:08:06,409 --> 04:08:08,041
TRAVIS: 22.

3837
04:08:08,041 --> 04:08:15,150
MATT: (impact noise) It just (explosion) spattered
across the ground. What was once shifting is now a

3838
04:08:15,150 --> 04:08:24,346
fine red cream as the true form of Hotis,
partially returned, is now scattered across the

3839
04:08:24,346 --> 04:08:31,659
steaming pavement of the depths of the Mentiri
prison. The devil is no more. You are free from

3840
04:08:31,659 --> 04:08:32,799
the curse.

3841
04:08:32,799 --> 04:08:34,355
(cheering)

3842
04:08:34,355 --> 04:08:36,655
MATT: Now just to get out of here, because you
hear the voices in the distance now getting--

3843
04:08:36,655 --> 04:08:38,225
LAURA: Now we just have to Plane Shift.

3844
04:08:38,225 --> 04:08:39,468
NOELLE: What is happening?

3845
04:08:39,468 --> 04:08:40,920
LAURA: Is it done?

3846
04:08:40,920 --> 04:08:44,914
TRAVIS: No. How much movement do I have left?

3847
04:08:44,914 --> 04:08:48,778
MATT: That was you. Because of the chains wrapping
around you-- which, by the way, did five points of

3848
04:08:48,778 --> 04:08:50,030
bludgeoning damage to you.

3849
04:08:50,030 --> 04:08:50,927
TRAVIS: Okay.

3850
04:08:50,927 --> 04:08:57,843
MATT: It takes you half movement to move through
that space so that's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. So

3851
04:08:57,843 --> 04:08:59,689
you can move two more squares.

3852
04:08:59,689 --> 04:09:02,483
TRAVIS: Two more squares. I'll come back out the
door and towards Keyleth.

3853
04:09:02,483 --> 04:09:05,526
MATT: All right. That'll get you about there. And
that's as far as you can get. The chains are

3854
04:09:05,526 --> 04:09:10,109
tangling you up and preventing you from moving
quickly. Ending Grog's turn. Taryon.

3855
04:09:10,109 --> 04:09:13,210
SAM: I mean, we're done.

3856
04:09:13,210 --> 04:09:17,607
LAURA: Get to Keyleth. We have to be touching
her.

3857
04:09:17,607 --> 04:09:26,712
SAM: I'll move to Keyleth and say: Tova, are you
coming with us? You have to, sort of.

3858
04:09:26,712 --> 04:09:27,851
NOELLE: Where are you going?

3859
04:09:27,851 --> 04:09:35,772
SAM: To another plane of existence. But one
without chain golems trying to kill you.

3860
04:09:35,772 --> 04:09:40,498
NOELLE: I can't. I can't leave my friends. I have
to try and find them.

3861
04:09:40,498 --> 04:09:42,923
SAM: How?

3862
04:09:42,923 --> 04:09:45,019
NOELLE: I don't know.

3863
04:09:45,019 --> 04:09:49,225
SAM: I'll go next to Keyleth.

3864
04:09:49,225 --> 04:09:51,650
MATT: Okay. So you step in next to her over the
grate.

3865
04:09:51,650 --> 04:10:01,413
SAM: I can make you invisible. I can make you fly.
What would help you get out of here?

3866
04:10:01,413 --> 04:10:03,790
NOELLE: I'll have that invisibility.

3867
04:10:03,790 --> 04:10:05,251
SAM: Sure.

3868
04:10:05,251 --> 04:10:07,034
NOELLE: Invisible bear?

3869
04:10:07,034 --> 04:10:13,776
MATT: As Tova vanishes in the moment, and is this
slight ripple in the air.

3870
04:10:13,776 --> 04:10:17,260
TALIESIN: Oh, you have a slight ripple figure.
Phantom bear.

3871
04:10:17,260 --> 04:10:18,551
LAURA: Does he?

3872
04:10:18,551 --> 04:10:23,349
MATT: There is where you are. Tova's form
vanishes.

3873
04:10:23,349 --> 04:10:25,071
NOELLE: How long does that last?

3874
04:10:25,071 --> 04:10:27,381
SAM: A minute.

3875
04:10:27,381 --> 04:10:28,359
NOELLE: Thanks.

3876
04:10:28,359 --> 04:10:29,543
SAM: Just one minute.

3877
04:10:29,543 --> 04:10:31,420
(laughter)

3878
04:10:31,420 --> 04:10:32,599
TRAVIS: Run real fast.

3879
04:10:32,599 --> 04:10:34,331
LAURA: And the minute you take damage, you become
visible again?

3880
04:10:34,331 --> 04:10:38,105
MATT: Invisibility lasts an hour.

3881
04:10:38,105 --> 04:10:41,418
SAM: It lasts an hour?! Oh! Hey, you can get out
with that.

3882
04:10:41,418 --> 04:10:43,279
NOELLE: Going to try and do that.

3883
04:10:43,279 --> 04:10:44,387
MARISHA: Get out.

3884
04:10:44,387 --> 04:10:47,042
TRAVIS: She's like: okay, I've got to get--
(poof)

3885
04:10:47,042 --> 04:10:51,163
MATT: All righty. Vex.

3886
04:10:51,163 --> 04:10:57,305
LAURA: All right. I'm going to run forward and try
to get to-- I'm going to poof Trinket in and run

3887
04:10:57,305 --> 04:10:59,761
forward and try to get to Keyleth.

3888
04:10:59,761 --> 04:11:08,271
MATT: Okay. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. That's as far
as you can get, right there. Make a double dash?

3889
04:11:08,271 --> 04:11:09,286
LAURA: Yeah.

3890
04:11:09,286 --> 04:11:16,539
MATT: All right. 25, 30. That's as far as you get,
and you take eight points of bludgeoning damage

3891
04:11:16,539 --> 04:11:19,788
from the chains that are whipping around you and
wrapping around your legs and tying you up as

3892
04:11:19,788 --> 04:11:30,353
you're reaching forward. It's like this swamp of
grinding metal. That ends your turn. Tova. You're

3893
04:11:30,353 --> 04:11:36,520
invisible. If you do any attacks, you lose
invisibility, so either you're going with them, or

3894
04:11:36,520 --> 04:11:39,799
you're retreating into the prison for better or
for worse.

3895
04:11:39,799 --> 04:11:48,046
NOELLE: Can I run over, pick up Vex, and carry her
over to her friends? 45.

3896
04:11:48,046 --> 04:11:49,607
SAM: Is Vex down?

3897
04:11:49,607 --> 04:11:51,346
NOELLE: No. She can't move any more.

3898
04:11:51,346 --> 04:11:53,155
SAM: Oh. (laughs)

3899
04:11:53,155 --> 04:12:00,247
MATT: 35, 40. You get right up next to her, right
there. She's light enough. You lift her up, and

3900
04:12:00,247 --> 04:12:04,356
you make a dash action to bring her over for half
speed.

3901
04:12:04,356 --> 04:12:06,580
LAURA: Oh my god.

3902
04:12:06,580 --> 04:12:11,712
MATT: 15, 20. You get her just there, within range
of Keyleth.

3903
04:12:11,712 --> 04:12:13,983
LAURA: I'm so confused.

3904
04:12:13,983 --> 04:12:16,948
NOELLE: You just got carried by an invisible
bear!

3905
04:12:16,948 --> 04:12:19,253
MATT: You take five points of bludgeoning damage,
reduced to half because you're in your bear form,

3906
04:12:19,253 --> 04:12:20,712
so you take two points of bludgeoning damage.

3907
04:12:20,712 --> 04:12:24,024
LAURA: I feel very nostalgic for some reason as
she's doing this.

3908
04:12:24,024 --> 04:12:26,119
This is very comfortable for me.

3909
04:12:26,119 --> 04:12:29,234
MATT: The golem's turn now.

3910
04:12:29,234 --> 04:12:32,554
LAURA: Oh god. Am I on the ground again? Did you
put me down?

3911
04:12:32,554 --> 04:12:34,521
NOELLE: Yeah, I put you down.

3912
04:12:34,521 --> 04:12:35,716
LAURA: Okay.

3913
04:12:35,716 --> 04:12:38,520
NOELLE: I mean, unless you want to be airplaned up
by an invisible bear.

3914
04:12:38,520 --> 04:12:40,344
LAURA: I mean, I'm not opposed, but.

3915
04:12:40,344 --> 04:12:42,527
MATT: The golem is going to make a chain prison
attack.

3916
04:12:42,527 --> 04:12:44,921
TRAVIS: A chain prison?

3917
04:12:44,921 --> 04:12:46,115
MATT: Yes.

3918
04:12:46,115 --> 04:12:50,687
LAURA: He's really going to just try to kill us
before we can get out of here.

3919
04:12:50,687 --> 04:13:00,243
MATT: It's going to-- let's see here. It's going
to get Percy, Keyleth, and Taryon.

3920
04:13:00,243 --> 04:13:01,844
SAM: Oh, shitballs.

3921
04:13:01,844 --> 04:13:04,797
MATT: I need you guys to all make dexterity saving
throws.

3922
04:13:04,797 --> 04:13:10,106
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, that's good,
Gil!

3923
04:13:10,106 --> 04:13:16,653
SAM: I'm feeling lucky. Thank god. 20.

3924
04:13:16,653 --> 04:13:19,167
MATT: 20? That's exactly what you needed.

3925
04:13:19,167 --> 04:13:21,831
MARISHA: 19 plus four, 23.

3926
04:13:21,831 --> 04:13:22,911
MATT: Percy?

3927
04:13:22,911 --> 04:13:28,676
TALIESIN: It's a dex saving throw, and 20 is what
we need? I'm going to use a resolve and see if I

3928
04:13:28,676 --> 04:13:30,213
can make this work.

3929
04:13:30,213 --> 04:13:31,430
MATT: Okay.

3930
04:13:31,430 --> 04:13:32,740
TALIESIN: Nope. Same thing. 17.

3931
04:13:32,740 --> 04:13:39,411
MATT: 17. So everyone else, you guys both manage
to break free. Percy, you are restrained.

3932
04:13:39,411 --> 04:13:40,324
TALIESIN: All right.

3933
04:13:40,324 --> 04:13:41,905
MARISHA: Gods damn it.

3934
04:13:41,905 --> 04:13:45,853
MATT: As the chains swirl up and wrap around your
legs and torso and you find

3935
04:13:45,853 --> 04:13:47,758
yourself bound in place.

3936
04:13:47,758 --> 04:13:50,430
TALIESIN: Can we make a chain?

3937
04:13:50,430 --> 04:13:53,492
LAURA: If we make a chain, we can reach over to
him.

3938
04:13:53,492 --> 04:13:56,306
MARISHA: Oh my god, like Guardians of the Galaxy,
you guys?

3939
04:13:56,306 --> 04:13:57,526
LAURA: Yeah!

3940
04:13:57,526 --> 04:13:59,691
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

3941
04:13:59,691 --> 04:14:08,631
MARISHA: I'm holding my turn and reaching out and
trying to make this chain as much as I can.

3942
04:14:08,631 --> 04:14:12,482
MATT: You're going to begin casting the spell and
holding the release of it until?

3943
04:14:12,482 --> 04:14:14,860
MARISHA: As soon as everyone links hands, we're
out.

3944
04:14:14,860 --> 04:14:18,767
MATT: At the start of your turn, you take nine
points of bludgeoning damage from the chains that

3945
04:14:18,767 --> 04:14:20,164
are swirling around you.

3946
04:14:20,164 --> 04:14:25,962
MARISHA: That's fine. Can I do a bonus action to
heal-- who's looking rough?

3947
04:14:25,962 --> 04:14:31,962
LAURA: You. Heal yourself.

3948
04:14:31,962 --> 04:14:33,164
TALIESIN: You.

3949
04:14:33,164 --> 04:14:35,520
LAURA: Just heal your-fucking-self.

3950
04:14:35,520 --> 04:14:38,784
MARISHA: Okay, I'm at 59 hit points. I'm going to
heal myself.

3951
04:14:38,784 --> 04:14:42,674
MATT: So 2nd-level Healing Word? 1st-level?

3952
04:14:42,674 --> 04:14:47,143
MARISHA: Yeah. 2nd-level. That's four plus another
three.

3953
04:14:47,143 --> 04:14:53,297
MATT: So seven plus six. 13. You heal 13, and you
begin casting Plane Shift. You pull out of your

3954
04:14:53,297 --> 04:14:58,307
side satchel the tuning fork that you have attuned
to where? Where are you going to be casting this

3955
04:14:58,307 --> 04:14:59,806
towards?

3956
04:14:59,806 --> 04:15:04,893
MARISHA: 73. Sorry, 73 hit points.

3957
04:15:04,893 --> 04:15:09,584
MATT: What location are you shifting towards,
Keyleth, as you begin the spell?

3958
04:15:09,584 --> 04:15:15,336
MARISHA: Home. Whitestone. Exandria.

3959
04:15:15,336 --> 04:15:19,703
MATT: Focusing on Whitestone in Exandria, you
begin to cast the incantation. You see the power

3960
04:15:19,703 --> 04:15:23,408
in her hands begins to glow, but she's holding it
back. She's concentrating hard.

3961
04:15:23,408 --> 04:15:29,789
MARISHA: And I just take whatever leftover action
I have to be like, Vox Machina, come on!

3962
04:15:29,789 --> 04:15:32,522
MATT: All right, ending your turn, Keyleth.
Percival, what are you doing?

3963
04:15:32,522 --> 04:15:34,116
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and break out of this
chain.

3964
04:15:34,116 --> 04:15:35,479
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a strength
check.

3965
04:15:35,479 --> 04:15:37,133
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

3966
04:15:37,133 --> 04:15:38,577
TRAVIS: You've got this.

3967
04:15:38,577 --> 04:15:40,601
SAM: Natural 20. Golden snitch.

3968
04:15:40,601 --> 04:15:45,405
TALIESIN: Strength check or strength save?

3969
04:15:45,405 --> 04:15:46,571
MATT: Strength check.

3970
04:15:46,571 --> 04:15:47,610
TALIESIN: 14.

3971
04:15:47,610 --> 04:15:49,925
MATT: 14. You can't break the chains. They're too
strong.

3972
04:15:49,925 --> 04:15:53,172
TALIESIN: Can I use an action surge to try and do
it again?

3973
04:15:53,172 --> 04:15:55,844
MATT: Yeah, because you get two now, at this
level.

3974
04:15:55,844 --> 04:15:57,358
TALIESIN: Yep, I've got one more.

3975
04:15:57,358 --> 04:15:58,915
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

3976
04:15:58,915 --> 04:16:02,463
TALIESIN: (sighs) Nope.

3977
04:16:02,463 --> 04:16:07,308
MATT: Can't break free. The chains are holding you
in place. Ending your turn. Grog, you're up.

3978
04:16:07,308 --> 04:16:09,514
TRAVIS: Who's the one who's back there?

3979
04:16:09,514 --> 04:16:11,802
LAURA: That's Vax. He can dash.

3980
04:16:11,802 --> 04:16:14,419
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah, I would like to move towards
Percy.

3981
04:16:14,419 --> 04:16:19,508
MATT: All right, at the start of your turn, Grog,
you take seven points of bludgeoning damage from

3982
04:16:19,508 --> 04:16:20,514
the swirling chains.

3983
04:16:20,514 --> 04:16:21,465
TRAVIS: Okay.

3984
04:16:21,465 --> 04:16:22,520
MATT: Reduced to three.

3985
04:16:22,520 --> 04:16:24,809
TRAVIS: I'm not raging.

3986
04:16:24,809 --> 04:16:30,316
MATT: So that's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. What's
that?

3987
04:16:30,316 --> 04:16:31,686
LAURA: He's not raging.

3988
04:16:31,686 --> 04:16:34,890
MATT: 50. You get right there.

3989
04:16:34,890 --> 04:16:40,471
LAURA: Tary and Grog can hold hands in that
position, right? He can reach Tary and Percy?

3990
04:16:40,471 --> 04:16:41,968
MARISHA: We just need a chain.

3991
04:16:41,968 --> 04:16:43,117
MATT: No, Taryon is right here.

3992
04:16:43,117 --> 04:16:45,674
LAURA: Yeah, so can he reach his hand out and have
Percy and Tary?

3993
04:16:45,674 --> 04:16:48,603
MATT: Everyone would need to shift one more in
that direction, or someone can plug that hole.

3994
04:16:48,603 --> 04:16:50,115
LAURA: Okay.

3995
04:16:50,115 --> 04:16:52,807
TRAVIS: Do I need to break your chains or just
touch you?

3996
04:16:52,807 --> 04:16:54,659
TALIESIN: Just touch will work.

3997
04:16:54,659 --> 04:16:55,869
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

3998
04:16:55,869 --> 04:16:56,847
MATT: That's true.

3999
04:16:56,847 --> 04:17:03,818
TRAVIS: All right. I just grab your hand, and I'll
lean back like this.

4000
04:17:03,818 --> 04:17:10,913
LAURA: Oh yeah, he's super tall. Can he reach
farther because he's super tall?

4001
04:17:10,913 --> 04:17:18,401
LIAM: I saw my sister get picked up and put down,
so I know where invisi-bear is, and I'm going to

4002
04:17:18,401 --> 04:17:24,803
push through and feel along my sister's shoulder
and feel were-bear's arm and say: You're in the

4003
04:17:24,803 --> 04:17:29,776
middle of hell. This is a Ring of Invisibility.
Thank you-- and push through, and I'm going to try

4004
04:17:29,776 --> 04:17:33,672
to use my bonus to push all the way through and
fill that gap.

4005
04:17:33,672 --> 04:17:37,464
TALIESIN: You may have to throw the knife.

4006
04:17:37,464 --> 04:17:41,745
MATT: You can just barely, with the chains that
are around you-- which by the way, Vax, you take

4007
04:17:41,745 --> 04:17:48,320
eight points of bludgeoning damage. You can just
get up to put the ring into Tova's hand, and

4008
04:17:48,320 --> 04:17:49,522
that's as far as you can get.

4009
04:17:49,522 --> 04:17:51,995
LIAM: I have an action and bonus action. Can't I
use the bonus action to dash?

4010
04:17:51,995 --> 04:17:53,034
MATT: You can, actually.

4011
04:17:53,034 --> 04:17:55,078
LAURA: Please, please, please.

4012
04:17:55,078 --> 04:17:57,415
NOELLE: Come on, guys. Get out of here.

4013
04:17:57,415 --> 04:17:59,894
LAURA: Please, just let him get there!

4014
04:17:59,894 --> 04:18:04,045
MATT: 25, 30. You're not quite there.

4015
04:18:04,045 --> 04:18:08,458
LIAM: All right, well, I grab Keyleth's hand and
we're going to work on closing this gap.

4016
04:18:08,458 --> 04:18:11,815
MATT: Well, you dashed with your bonus.

4017
04:18:11,815 --> 04:18:13,901
LIAM: My action wasn't to give her the ring?

4018
04:18:13,901 --> 04:18:16,427
MATT: So yeah, you feel for her. That's your
turn.

4019
04:18:16,427 --> 04:18:18,338
MARISHA: Can you throw your dagger and hit me?

4020
04:18:18,338 --> 04:18:19,528
LIAM: I'm out.

4021
04:18:19,528 --> 04:18:21,252
MARISHA: You can't do anything else. You can't hit
me?

4022
04:18:21,252 --> 04:18:25,480
SAM: No problem, guys.

4023
04:18:25,480 --> 04:18:29,119
LAURA: We've just got one teeny little gap here,
and whose turn is it?

4024
04:18:29,119 --> 04:18:31,314
MATT: All right, that brings us to Vex.

4025
04:18:31,314 --> 04:18:32,414
LAURA: That's me?

4026
04:18:32,414 --> 04:18:33,784
MATT: Well, technically Taryon.

4027
04:18:33,784 --> 04:18:36,427
SAM: Oh. Me? I'm right there, aren't I?

4028
04:18:36,427 --> 04:18:37,329
MATT: Yeah.

4029
04:18:37,329 --> 04:18:40,024
SAM: Can I bridge the gap somehow?

4030
04:18:40,024 --> 04:18:42,728
LIAM: Can he yank Vax?

4031
04:18:42,728 --> 04:18:46,219
MATT: You can use your action to try and pull him
over.

4032
04:18:46,219 --> 04:18:48,473
SAM: To pull Vax over?

4033
04:18:48,473 --> 04:18:49,477
MATT: Yeah.

4034
04:18:49,477 --> 04:18:50,759
LAURA: Fill the hole.

4035
04:18:50,759 --> 04:18:53,231
MATT: You do take seven points of bludgeoning
damage from the chains.

4036
04:18:53,231 --> 04:18:55,198
TALIESIN: Oh god. Stress.

4037
04:18:55,198 --> 04:19:02,662
SAM: Okay, great. Seven points. Okay, yeah. I'll
reach like I've never reached before, and say:

4038
04:19:02,662 --> 04:19:09,931
We're brothers forever. Lifelong teammates.
Friends.

4039
04:19:09,931 --> 04:19:11,730
TALIESIN: Out, out. Go, go!

4040
04:19:11,730 --> 04:19:14,101
MARISHA: You fucking ass. Goddamn it!

4041
04:19:14,101 --> 04:19:22,754
MATT: You pull him into the space. Everyone grabs
hands.

4042
04:19:22,754 --> 04:19:24,846
LAURA: Oh, not you.

4043
04:19:24,846 --> 04:19:29,701
MATT: You see Tova's form appear briefly as she
puts the ring on and then vanishes once more. You

4044
04:19:29,776 --> 04:19:34,037
see the rest of them grab arms together. Keyleth,
you finish the spell, Plane Shift.

4045
04:19:34,037 --> 04:19:37,208
NOELLE: I'll look you up if I make it out of here
alive.

4046
04:19:37,208 --> 04:19:38,863
MARISHA: Please!

4047
04:19:38,863 --> 04:19:40,443
LIAM: The ring's a loaner!

4048
04:19:40,443 --> 04:19:41,975
NOELLE: We've still got to get that beer.

4049
04:19:41,975 --> 04:19:45,597
SAM: Greystone Keep! Get my robot!

4050
04:19:45,597 --> 04:19:49,936
MATT: You can see the chain golem swelling as the
chains are feeding it. It's growing larger in the

4051
04:19:49,936 --> 04:19:55,028
chambers, its red eyes getting brighter and
brighter. As you all clasp hands together, the

4052
04:19:55,028 --> 04:20:00,034
light flashes a bright whitish-green. There's a
high-pitched whine just as you hear devils rushing

4053
04:20:00,219 --> 04:20:04,351
in from across the hallway. (whoosh) Silence.

4054
04:20:04,351 --> 04:20:07,165
And that's where we'll pick up next week.

4055
04:20:07,165 --> 04:20:10,222
(groaning)

4056
04:20:10,222 --> 04:20:15,104
LAURA: Holy shit.

4057
04:20:15,104 --> 04:20:17,305
LIAM: You've got to live, Tova. You've got to
live!

4058
04:20:17,305 --> 04:20:19,581
NOELLE: I'll do my best.

4059
04:20:19,581 --> 04:20:21,316
MATT: Holy shit.

4060
04:20:21,316 --> 04:20:23,873
NOELLE: I'm doing great.

4061
04:20:23,873 --> 04:20:26,288
TRAVIS: Oh my god, Matthew!

4062
04:20:26,288 --> 04:20:30,165
MATT: Thank you guys. Oh shit.

4063
04:20:30,165 --> 04:20:33,284
LIAM: You've got to Bilbo Baggins your way out of
that shit!

4064
04:20:33,284 --> 04:20:38,612
NOELLE: I'm in a much better position than I was
to start with.

4065
04:20:38,612 --> 04:20:40,809
LAURA: Holy crap.

4066
04:20:40,809 --> 04:20:45,176
MATT: Let's just hope Tova doesn't come across
another pit fiend, because they can see through

4067
04:20:45,176 --> 04:20:46,294
invisibility.

4068
04:20:46,294 --> 04:20:48,283
SAM: Five minutes later, Tova was killed.

4069
04:20:48,283 --> 04:20:50,711
(laughter)

4070
04:20:50,711 --> 04:20:52,737
MATT: There are devils that can see through
invisibility.

4071
04:20:52,737 --> 04:20:54,976
NOELLE: I'm sure it will be fine.

4072
04:20:54,976 --> 04:20:57,364
MATT: I'm sure you'll be fine. It'll be great.

4073
04:20:57,364 --> 04:21:00,104
SAM: Worst case scenario, she ends the day where
she started.

4074
04:21:00,104 --> 04:21:03,813
LAURA: That was a really fun episode. That was a
really fun game.

4075
04:21:03,813 --> 04:21:05,970
MATT: That was awesome, guys.

4076
04:21:05,970 --> 04:21:07,858
LAURA: I feel like that was the most fun that
we've had in a while.

4077
04:21:07,858 --> 04:21:10,605
TRAVIS: Chain golems, all the demons.

4078
04:21:10,605 --> 04:21:12,639
LAURA: I'm so tired!

4079
04:21:12,639 --> 04:21:15,825
MATT: It was fun. Guys, well done.

4080
04:21:15,825 --> 04:21:17,297
MARISHA: We made it out, right?

4081
04:21:17,297 --> 04:21:18,618
MATT: Noelle, thank you so much for playing with
us.

4082
04:21:18,618 --> 04:21:21,674
NOELLE: This was fucking awesome.

4083
04:21:21,674 --> 04:21:28,687
MATT: Such a blast. Good sticking to the guns and
staying behind. I was like, I don't know what

4084
04:21:28,687 --> 04:21:31,878
she's going to do about this. Thinking you were
going to find a way to find them.

4085
04:21:31,878 --> 04:21:34,422
NOELLE: Yeah, and then I just keep showing up
every week. You can't get rid of me.

4086
04:21:34,422 --> 04:21:36,823
(laughter)

4087
04:21:36,823 --> 04:21:41,047
MATT: It's happened before. Our story ended up
keeping Rothfuss here for three or four weeks in a

4088
04:21:41,047 --> 04:21:43,368
row. It was supposed to be just a one-night
thing.

4089
04:21:43,368 --> 04:21:44,860
NOELLE: I had a mission.

4090
04:21:44,860 --> 04:21:48,504
MATT: He got a killing blow on a boss, too. We've
had two guests get killing blows on a boss.

4091
04:21:48,504 --> 04:21:51,606
MARISHA: We've had good themes of guests killing
bosses.

4092
04:21:51,606 --> 04:21:52,667
LAURA AND MATT: Yeah.

4093
04:21:52,667 --> 04:21:55,194
MARISHA: Because Mary killed the white dragon.

4094
04:21:55,194 --> 04:21:57,466
MATT: That's true. You guys have got to pick up
your slack.

4095
04:21:57,466 --> 04:22:02,855
LIAM: Maybe your ghost can haunt us. "Remember
when you left me in hell?"

4096
04:22:02,855 --> 04:22:05,042
LAURA: Good times.

4097
04:22:05,042 --> 04:22:08,084
NOELLE: Or it'll just be me with the invisibility
ring.

4098
04:22:08,281 --> 04:22:13,748
MATT: Thank you so much for coming and playing
with us, Noelle.

4099
04:22:13,748 --> 04:22:15,787
NOELLE: Thank you for having me. This has been
awesome.

4100
04:22:15,787 --> 04:22:20,513
MATT: Yay. So guys, once again, you can check out
Noelle. If you want to pimp your stuff real fast

4101
04:22:20,513 --> 04:22:23,542
before you leave? Nimona!

4102
04:22:23,542 --> 04:22:25,653
MARISHA: Look at that! And Lumberjanes!

4103
04:22:25,653 --> 04:22:26,867
SAM: And Lumberjanes.

4104
04:22:26,867 --> 04:22:31,012
NOELLE: And Lumberjanes. And other things soon to
be revealed.

4105
04:22:31,012 --> 04:22:36,098
MATT: Yeah, I'm excited. Well, thank you again.
Guys, awesome job. We'll pick this up next week,

4106
04:22:36,098 --> 04:22:42,835
and we'll see you guys then. Until then, is it
Thursday yet? Good night.

4107
04:22:42,835 --> 04:29:26,640
