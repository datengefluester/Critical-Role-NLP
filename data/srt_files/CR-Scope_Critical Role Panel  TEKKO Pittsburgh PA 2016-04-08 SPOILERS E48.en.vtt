NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:13.035
[intro music]

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:23.703
(applause)

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:27.069
MATT and MARISHA: (nervously) Hi.

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.948
MATT: We're doing better now. We just got food, so
that was the key to our evening.

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:33.317
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nice shirt.

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:39.225
(applause)

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:41.332
MARISHA: Miss you, Troy.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:44.199
(laughter)

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.697
MATT: So hello everyone! How's everyone doing?

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:51.878
MARISHA: It just shocked me! Hi! It shocked me.
These are--

00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:54.115
MATT: They're just small enough--

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:58.637
MARISHA: They're kind of barely useful. Just going
to put that over there.

00:00:58.637 --> 00:01:09.430
MATT: We're going to build a better mic stand.
There we go. That's not precarious at all. That'll

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:20.458
last the entire panel without issue. Hi, welcome
to our panel on the tabletop renaissance, tabletop

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:25.308
gaming, and all points in between. Let's do some
introductions real fast!

00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:27.805
MARISHA: Sure, you should start.

00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:28.869
MATT: Okay.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.818
(laughter)

00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:36.557
MATT: My name is Matthew Mercer. I am a voice
actor from Los Angeles, California and long time

00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:47.429
indoor kid. Yeah, you know what's up. Me and
sunlight didn't get along-- still don't get along.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.470
I spent most of my life playing tabletop games,
running tabletop games, and am currently the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.179
dungeon master on Critical Role.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.358
(applause)

00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:01.905
MATT: And Marisha!

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.695
MARISHA: Now that he said the magical words,
Critical Role--

00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:07.348
(applause)

00:02:07.348 --> 00:02:13.977
MARISHA: I can say that I play the half-elven
druid, Keyleth, in Critical Role, who--

00:02:13.977 --> 00:02:17.859
(applause)

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:25.108
MARISHA: I am also a voice actor/person who does
things in the entertainment industry out of Los

00:02:25.108 --> 00:02:31.253
Angeles. I am Margaret in the Persona franchise,
I'm Laura Arseid in Legend of Heroes: Trails of

00:02:31.253 --> 00:02:39.644
Cold Steel-- longest name in history ever-- I'm in
Metal Gear Solid: Phantom Pain, and Battlefront,

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:41.629
and he's my dungeon master.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.468
(applause)

00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:47.324
MARISHA: And he was actually my <i>first</i> dungeon
master.

00:02:47.324 --> 00:02:49.318
AUDIENCE: (oohing)

00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:57.227
MARISHA: I know, I know. And then I went on, and I
had many other dungeon masters. And then I came back.

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:59.774
(laughter)

00:02:59.774 --> 00:03:04.802
MATT: This is a good panel for context. Any other
panel, this would be a very different mood right

00:03:04.802 --> 00:03:07.487
now. (laughs)

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:11.448
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's next door.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:14.251
MATT: Yeah, there you go. That's the 18-plus at
11:00.

00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:17.878
MARISHA: Oh, I thought she was talking about the
vape show.

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:20.229
(laughter)

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.558
MATT: No vaping.

00:03:21.558 --> 00:03:23.599
MARISHA: No vaping! (cries out)

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.057
MATT: I keep seeing those signs everywhere, and as
a person who in no way, shape, or form has ever

00:03:27.057 --> 00:03:29.269
nor would vape, I--

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.817
MARISHA: It still makes you feel like you're in
trouble.

00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:32.879
MATT: Yeah. "Well I didn't-- I'm not-- Why?"

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.146
MARISHA: "I'm not-- I wasn't!"

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:37.076
MATT: It's silently aggressive.

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:42.299
MARISHA: It's like when a cop gets behind you when
you're driving, and you're just like, "I'm just

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.801
"going to mess with my radio; I'm just going to act
natural. I don't have any reason to be concerned."

00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:52.198
MATT: "My registration's good, and my tail lights
work. Why am I still nervous?!"

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.903
MARISHA: "Ten and two, ten and two."

00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:56.526
(laughter)

00:03:56.526 --> 00:04:06.461
MATT: (laughs) So this panel is to discuss, talk--
It's generally going to be a Q&amp;A here. Talk about

00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:14.171
all nerdy points of tabletop gaming, board gaming,
role-playing games, and all those fun little

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:19.605
adventures and experiences many of us have had in
our lives or are currently discovering and/or will

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:24.269
hopefully discover very soon. For those that
aren't aware, Critical Role is a show that we do

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:30.329
every Thursday--mostly every Thursday--on Geek &amp;
Sundry's Twitch stream, where us and a bunch of

00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:34.573
other voice actors play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and
roll dice and have no idea what we're doing.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:42.865
MARISHA: We have an insane cast of people, like
Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham and Liam

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:49.908
O'Brien and Taliesin and Ashley and Sam Riegel.

00:04:49.908 --> 00:04:55.228
MATT: I'm just going to let you guys know right
now, we turned down playing D&amp;D with a sloth today

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.022
to be here with you guys. That's how much we love
you.

00:04:58.022 --> 00:04:59.220
MARISHA: That's true.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.038
(applause)

00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:06.259
MARISHA: And all of our bastard friends are just
sending pictures of them.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.878
MATT: It's great.

00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:13.850
MARISHA: They are like, "Look what you're missing,
guys." And I'm like, "I'm in Pittsburgh. I've got

00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:18.361
"Primanti Brothers. Take that!" See! They
know.

00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:22.939
MATT: I got the e-mail two weeks ago, "Hey, would you
like to dungeon master for a sloth?" I'm

00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:29.519
like, "Yes! When is it?" "Friday, oh..." Ivan's
got this.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:35.379
MARISHA: Can I just say the most ridiculous
conversations we ever had, though, in the Geek &amp;

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:41.144
Sundry offices, were revolving around this sloth.
I was like, "Guys, we have to stop talking about

00:05:41.144 --> 00:05:46.798
"him like he's a real person." It all started with
them going, "Well, when's the sloth going to come

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:51.492
"in?" And they were like, "Well, you know, we got
this call. We got to see what his schedule is and

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.284
see when he's available because we're going to
have to book him out. He's two weeks out." And I

00:05:56.284 --> 00:06:01.985
was like, "What the-- I'm available next week.
I'm pretty sure the sloth works more than I do in

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.613
"the entertainment industry."

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.914
MATT: I place the blame squarely on Zootopia and
Kristen Bell.

00:06:06.914 --> 00:06:08.854
MARISHA and MATT: Yeah

00:06:08.854 --> 00:06:10.389
(laughter)

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.545
MARISHA: And then Ivan was like, "The sloth is
actually going to be playing a half-elven monk."

00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:24.645
And I'm like, "What? Stop saying these sentences
like it's going to happen. It's weird!"

00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:30.263
MATT: It's a wonderful time to be alive. This is
what Personal Singularity was referring to. "The

00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:38.055
"Sloth Singularity." Anyway, we got a little
off-topic there. So we play D&amp;D and I grew up

00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:45.831
playing all sorts of RPGs, everything from GURPS to
Savage Worlds to Rifts and most of the Palladium

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:49.208
stuff, as broken as it was. It was wonderful, as
broken as it was.

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:50.444
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Broken and fun!

00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:58.055
MATT: Exactly! In a very fever-dream kind of way.
'Wormwood' is enough to say and you know what was

00:06:58.097 --> 00:07:02.912
going on there. I've always found tabletop
roleplaying games, not only for me, were a great

00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:09.679
place to explore narrative and just be more
comfortable as a person. I think a lot of my

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:15.621
social skills as a developing young adult I
developed through practice in roleplaying game

00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:19.935
environments. And as a performer and a dungeon
master or game master, it was such a great

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:29.173
playground for me to learn about what I could do
and expand my repertoire and range. I owe a lot of

00:07:29.173 --> 00:07:35.022
my current life to tabletop games, if not most of
it. I think one of the main times we ever hung

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:40.134
out was when I was asked to run a game of D&amp;D for
you. Even you're part of that thanks I owe to

00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:50.849
tabletop gaming. <i>Too cute!</i> So that's my tabletop
background, there. Marisha, you got started--

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:59.472
MARISHA: You were my first dungeon master.
I grew up in Kentucky. It's not that my parents

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.513
were trying to keep D&amp;D away from me or anything
like that. My parents just also didn't have access

00:08:05.513 --> 00:08:09.982
to it. And we didn't have access to it because
it's Kentucky. And you know--

00:08:09.982 --> 00:08:11.317
MATT: It's the devil!

00:08:11.317 --> 00:08:21.390
MARISHA: We're worshipping that cult shit. So
then I came out to-- but I grew up with Magic: the

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:27.210
Gathering and I played a lot of RPGs and I'm a
big Final Fantasy nerd and so I was always a video

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:33.731
game and comic book nerd beforehand, I just didn't
have the resources to play any tabletop games. And

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:41.164
then I came out to Los Angeles. And I was like
"Hey, Matt Mercer, will you run a D&amp;D--" And I

00:08:41.164 --> 00:08:44.430
thought you'd say no, and then he said yes.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.399
AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:49.170
MATT: I ran it for you and your boyfriend at the
time.

00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:50.903
MARISHA: That's true.

00:08:50.951 --> 00:08:53.861
(laughter)

00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:55.942
MATT: So watch out for the dungeon masters out
there.

00:08:55.942 --> 00:08:58.971
(laughter)

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:04.431
MARISHA: And for all those aspiring dungeon
masters: it works.

00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:12.283
MATT: It helps to be proficient in persuasion.
No, that was like a year and a half later, you

00:09:12.324 --> 00:09:14.235
guys were already broken up before we started
dating.

00:09:14.298 --> 00:09:15.567
MARISHA: Yeah, it wasn't like that.

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:19.502
(laughter)

00:09:19.502 --> 00:09:26.907
MATT: But what's been really cool is-- I'm not
one of the OG roleplaying game-- There's a

00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:31.997
generation of roleplaying game people, that were
there from the beginning, the old Gygax days, the chainmail,

00:09:32.054 --> 00:09:37.294
pre-D&amp;D days, where it began in strategic war
miniature combat and built onto the

00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:43.103
roleplaying from there. I've learned so much from
people who came from that genre and it's been

00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:49.408
really cool to watch, through our show, all these
different generations of "the old guard". And you

00:09:49.408 --> 00:09:56.626
had the 80s revamp when GURPS got big and they had
this resurgence in roleplaying games in the 90s

00:09:56.626 --> 00:10:02.557
during that Rob Liefeld era where Palladium got
really popular. Even then it was still a very

00:10:02.557 --> 00:10:08.404
subgenre of entertainment and socially had this
stigma that had partially stemmed from a lot of

00:10:08.404 --> 00:10:15.550
the early anti-D&amp;D, "Demon magic!" stuff that
happened and also this idea that only kids who had

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:21.912
no social skills and didn't want to play with
other people. That was the idea and it was never

00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:23.562
that. I never had that experience.

00:10:23.562 --> 00:10:28.793
MARISHA: Yeah, in fact that's the total, exact
opposite, actually. How did that even happen? How

00:10:28.793 --> 00:10:30.773
did D&amp;D players get that reputation?

00:10:30.773 --> 00:10:34.892
MATT: Largely because of media and because--

00:10:34.892 --> 00:10:37.709
MARISHA: I mean, Tom Hanks and Mazes and Monsters.

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:41.084
MATT: To be fair-- and I don't want to get into
this too deep because it's a whole different

00:10:41.084 --> 00:10:48.127
discussion-- but a lot of the American identity
and masculinity stems from this very "Go sports!"

00:10:48.127 --> 00:10:55.363
and there's nothing wrong with that. You can do
both. There was this idea that if you weren't the

00:10:55.363 --> 00:11:02.624
outdoor, varsity sports kid and you preferred to
sit down and make up fantasy worlds, then that was

00:11:02.624 --> 00:11:08.540
considered the un-masculine thing and the
not-desirable thing and of course media pushing this

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:14.332
whole pocket protector geek feel in the 70s and
80s especially--

00:11:14.332 --> 00:11:17.402
MARISHA: Big Bang Theory laugh tracks--

00:11:17.402 --> 00:11:25.502
MATT: Sorry if you're a fan of the show. No. No
I'm not. There is no remorse. It is not for me,

00:11:25.502 --> 00:11:34.222
that show. Power to you, not for me. There's this
trend that led to this unfortunate stigma that

00:11:34.222 --> 00:11:40.352
the genre of gaming took on for a long time and
we're finally pulling out of that and I think a

00:11:40.352 --> 00:11:41.236
lot of that--

00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:42.730
MARISHA: Mainly thanks to Travis Willingham.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.883
(laughter)

00:11:43.883 --> 00:11:47.561
MATT: Well, he's definitely helped in that
regard.

00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:50.352
MARISHA: The guy who played football in college--

00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:51.511
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And Vin Diesel!

00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:52.817
MARISHA: And Vin Diesel.

00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:57.921
MATT: Vin Diesel was one of the breaking points,
too, and I think it's a combination of, one, pop

00:11:57.954 --> 00:12:04.007
culture has become culture now. With all of these
major geek properties that everyone all of a

00:12:04.007 --> 00:12:11.339
sudden is stopping and realizing, "Hey! We all
like Spiderman in this room? Oh, okay. All right."

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:12.801
MARISHA: That's cool, yeah!

00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:16.342
MATT: We've had that wave of geek culture,
which has been really cool, and now we have this

00:12:16.394 --> 00:12:20.700
new wave of storytellers. All the people that are
becoming the producers and writers and actors that

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.621
are inheriting the entertainment industry are all
the kids that grew up in the 70s and 80s.

00:12:25.702 --> 00:12:27.222
MARISHA: Surprise! They're nerds!

00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:34.534
MATT: Playing these games. Now you look at
the people that are creating all the mainstream

00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:38.821
media entertainment and they're all of us. They're
all the indoor kids that, instead of going out and

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.849
beating up kids for their lunch money, they were
inside figuring out orc encounters in the second

00:12:43.849 --> 00:12:53.543
level of the dungeon. Now they get to get paid for
that. We're at this renaissance period where, one,

00:12:53.603 --> 00:12:59.681
it's becoming okay to talk about it and openly be
proud of the fact that you're a tabletop

00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:06.382
roleplaying geek. And two, people who have always
been interested now have an open forum where they

00:13:06.382 --> 00:13:11.372
can be like, "You know what, I've always wanted to
see what this was about and try it. Can we do

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:17.138
"that?" and there not be this negative backlash. And
it's been really, really cool to watch so many

00:13:17.193 --> 00:13:19.698
people come into this genre of gaming.

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:23.220
[alarm noise in the background]

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.873
MATT: Run. Now!

00:13:24.873 --> 00:13:30.313
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's a patio door. Somebody
opened it. They didn't shut it right.

00:13:30.313 --> 00:13:31.853
MATT: We're all safe now.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.622
(laughter)

00:13:33.622 --> 00:13:34.981
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's not a fire.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:43.641
MARISHA: Anti-life-shell. Boof. Meet within ten
feet of me. Whole room.

00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:45.667
MATT: Fit everyone within ten feet of you!

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:47.112
MARISHA: Everyone within ten feet.

00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:55.680
MATT: The best Katamari Damacy level ever. By the
way, guys, I want to point out this gentleman over

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:02.731
here who-- for those who saw the episode of
Critmas-- who gave me my Thordak. My colossal red

00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:04.071
dragon right there.

00:14:04.071 --> 00:14:06.973
(applause)

00:14:06.973 --> 00:14:14.371
MARISHA: That's right! Applaud him! Now get up,
get out! No, no, them! I'd also like to point out

00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:25.890
an amazing woman up front cross-stitching the de
Rolo crest. That caught my eye. I know it's a work

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.068
in progress. Is it okay if we see? Like what the
what?!

00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:31.627
MATT: That's amazing!

00:14:31.627 --> 00:14:34.160
MARISHA: What the what?! This is insane.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.227
STEPHANIE: You can tell Sam, "This is cross
stitching."

00:14:36.227 --> 00:14:37.367
MATT: (laughs)

00:14:37.367 --> 00:14:40.360
MARISHA: Oh, my God!

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.377
MATT: Look at this thing, guys!

00:14:42.377 --> 00:14:44.549
MARISHA: Oh my God, you guys!

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:48.689
(applause)

00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:50.070
MARISHA: So nice!

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.019
MATT: This is actually a segue from my
conversation-- I'll come back to it. I also want

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:58.362
to point out one of the wonderful things about
this community that has blown me away is how many

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:03.171
people have gotten into the game and created
their own adventures, and share them with us on a

00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:07.862
weekly basis and other people who have taken
inspiration from this silly little D&amp;D show we do,

00:15:07.862 --> 00:15:12.697
and do incredible crafts like this, and do
incredible artwork and write their own stories and

00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:18.669
make their own little minis, and paint them and
send us pictures. The amount of creative

00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:24.366
inspiration that's come out of this community is
amazing. That's a very valid example.

00:15:24.366 --> 00:15:35.180
MARISHA: Yeah, it's so incredibly heartwarming to
see the whole art-inspiring-art aspect and that's

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:41.400
what I think is incredible about it. Like I said,
Critical Role would not be the show it-- We wouldn't

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:48.372
be Critical Role if it wasn't for the
Critters, and the fan art, and the fanfiction, and

00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:56.682
the music. Every little piece of art that you guys
put out, we try and catch every single one of

00:15:56.682 --> 00:15:58.717
them, and it's all just incredible.

00:15:58.722 --> 00:16:02.941
MATT: It's Liam's obsession. He scours the
internet and collects it.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.292
MARISHA: He knows almost all the artists. He knows
all of you people by name.

00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:07.523
(laughter)

00:16:07.523 --> 00:16:09.023
MARISHA: I'm not joking. I'm not joking.

00:16:09.023 --> 00:16:13.423
MATT: Test him on it. Tell him we said that. If he
doesn't know it, he's disappointed you.

00:16:13.423 --> 00:16:15.471
(laughter)

00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:17.024
MATT: Don't, actually.

00:16:17.115 --> 00:16:19.192
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Not on Liam appreciation day!

00:16:19.276 --> 00:16:20.524
MARISHA: Yeah, it's Liam appreciation day.

00:16:20.524 --> 00:16:22.380
MATT: Show him your appreciation by asking,
"What's my name?"

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.201
(laughter)

00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:25.212
MATT: Don't do that.

00:16:25.212 --> 00:16:26.484
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Francis.

00:16:26.484 --> 00:16:32.294
MATT: There you go. To finish my point from
earlier, what's really cool about this emerging

00:16:32.294 --> 00:16:38.991
period of time is you have old guard and new
guard coming together and discovering each other,

00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:43.883
and you're starting to find that there is no real
difference in age and background. We had a few

00:16:43.972 --> 00:16:49.442
Critters come by the studio one time and it was
their gaming group, and the gaming group was a 21

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:59.832
year old blond pop star, a 48 year old grey-haired
blacksmith, we had a mid-30's accountant lady, and

00:16:59.832 --> 00:17:04.485
it was every single-- you couldn't have picked a
stranger eclectic group of individuals from

00:17:04.485 --> 00:17:07.863
different walks of life that were sitting there
and geeking out so hardcore about their last

00:17:07.922 --> 00:17:12.612
adventure they'd had together. I'm like, this. This is
the magic of tabletop gaming. Because when you're

00:17:12.623 --> 00:17:17.968
all at that table, none of your background or
where you came from matters. You are all there

00:17:17.968 --> 00:17:22.523
creating this experience together, and you will
remember it as vividly as any other experience

00:17:22.523 --> 00:17:24.402
you've had in your life.

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:30.673
MARISHA: There is an amazing woman who wrote us, I
think, over our Facebook page not that long ago,

00:17:30.673 --> 00:17:41.241
saying how she was thanking us: "I'm a 39 year old
mom. You guys convinced me that it was okay for

00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:49.656
"someone of my age to play." She picked up a book
and started playing a game. That's what I think is

00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:56.065
the most important lesson that we can learn out of
tabletop gaming in general. That there's this

00:17:56.065 --> 00:18:06.374
really sad societal pressure that starts pushing
on you really hard when you're suddenly a child,

00:18:06.374 --> 00:18:09.613
then you're suddenly an adult, and then when
you're suddenly an adult, it's like you're not

00:18:09.613 --> 00:18:13.963
allowed to play anymore and you're not allowed to
use your imagination, and I think that's a really

00:18:13.963 --> 00:18:24.442
sad travesty. I think it's important to remember
that adults can still play pretend, and make

00:18:24.442 --> 00:18:27.811
believe, and that that's really important to our
mental health.

00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:29.039
MATT: Yeah.

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:32.690
MARISHA: Especially as stressful as life is as an
adult.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.787
MATT: It's not that you can, it's that you
<i>should.</i>

00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:35.733
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:18:35.733 --> 00:18:41.671
MATT: It's healthy, it's therapeutic. You learn
about yourself through play. You engage in

00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:44.767
relationships and build relationships a lot
stronger than you would elsewhere. It's a

00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:49.376
wonderful medium, and just one of many mediums,
tabletop gaming. One of many mediums that allow

00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:54.331
you to reconnect with that sense of play as an
adult through all ages, and it's been really cool

00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:59.274
to watch that come to the forefront of society
again. That makes me really happy.

00:18:59.274 --> 00:19:03.194
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been saying this a lot here
lately where I've slowly started to realize,

00:19:03.194 --> 00:19:11.742
especially with the show making our games weekly,
that Keyleth has totally infiltrated me a little

00:19:11.742 --> 00:19:22.128
bit, and she's made me a better person. I
legitimately believe that 100%. I'm not like

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:27.681
Keyleth. There are so many ways that she's
different from me, but being her for so long has

00:19:27.681 --> 00:19:32.976
taught me to empathize with people who are like
her, and she's influenced me, and I think she's

00:19:32.976 --> 00:19:39.962
made me a more empathetic person. I think there's
a lot of important things that you can get from

00:19:39.962 --> 00:19:43.665
roleplaying games that people don't talk about,
that we should.

00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:46.887
MATT: Well, it's a new form of storytelling. I
have a very similar experience where, since we've

00:19:46.887 --> 00:19:49.281
started playing weekly, I have become more
schizophrenic.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.666
(laughter)

00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:53.785
MATT: I talk to myself more when nobody's home.

00:19:53.785 --> 00:19:55.125
(laughter)

00:19:55.125 --> 00:20:02.216
MATT: Storytelling as a medium is as old as we've
had people. The idea of telling stories, and

00:20:02.216 --> 00:20:07.883
creating mythology, and the elders of the tribe
telling the younger generation about the great

00:20:07.883 --> 00:20:14.575
heroes of old, whether they be historical or
created. It's these heroic tales that inspire the

00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:20.457
next generation to want to be better people, to
become these heroes, to try and make their mark on

00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:28.105
the world for the better. And this is a medium for
all of us where we can create something, an aspect

00:20:28.105 --> 00:20:33.947
of ourselves, that we don't get to explore and
experience often enough. And through these games

00:20:33.947 --> 00:20:38.846
create a character and a personality that, even in
the smallest way, will help us be a better person.

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:42.433
Unless you're playing a totally shitty group of
evil characters, in which case it's just to blow

00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:47.265
off some steam and that's totally cool. Don't let
that affect it too much. But yeah, it's a really

00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:49.836
cool therapeutic medium in that way as well.

00:20:49.836 --> 00:20:54.201
MARISHA: Yeah, it teaches you to think
differently, and to think how other people might

00:20:54.201 --> 00:21:01.742
think. It breaks down the idea of the monomyth.
That there's a definitive line between good and

00:21:01.742 --> 00:21:09.373
evil, which I've never believed. Even bad
characters, even the "evil" of characters,

00:21:09.373 --> 00:21:17.601
generally have motives that are rooted pretty
logically. They're good lessons.

00:21:17.601 --> 00:21:19.410
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.893
MARISHA: We should take questions because we've
just been rambling.

00:21:21.893 --> 00:21:28.338
MATT: Sorry, just talking at you. We'll go
ahead and start calling folks for questions here.

00:21:28.379 --> 00:21:31.511
We'll go ahead and start with this wonderful lady
over here in the green dress.

00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:33.307
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Um, so...

00:21:33.307 --> 00:21:35.326
MATT: That's all right.

00:21:35.326 --> 00:21:39.943
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I tried to run a game once, and I
was awful at it, because I'm very much-- Okay,

00:21:39.943 --> 00:21:42.761
I've planned all this stuff out, and of course
nobody does that.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.601
MATT: We're all awful in the beginning for that
reason, don't worry.

00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:55.357
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So what are things that you do
to prepare or prep for it, or exercises, or did

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:58.909
you do improv classes? What helps you to prep for
that?

00:21:58.909 --> 00:22:03.512
MATT: It's funny you say improv classes. It's not
a route for everybody, but it is tremendously

00:22:03.512 --> 00:22:08.601
helpful in so many aspects of life, in my opinion.
Taking improv classes, not just as an actor and a

00:22:08.601 --> 00:22:15.210
performer, but as a person, it teaches you, one,
how to work really well in a group. It teaches you

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.728
a group dynamic and energy where it's all
collaborative.

00:22:17.807 --> 00:22:19.737
MARISHA: It also teaches fast response time.

00:22:19.737 --> 00:22:25.155
MATT: Yes! Very, very quick thinking. Thinking on
your feet when you're handed stuff you weren't

00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:26.286
expecting.

00:22:26.286 --> 00:22:29.785
MARISHA: Doctors will take improv classes to help
with their response time.

00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:30.824
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No way!

00:22:30.824 --> 00:22:31.886
MARISHA: True story.

00:22:31.886 --> 00:22:36.135
MATT: So it helps tremendously in many social
aspects, but one of the largest rules of improv is

00:22:36.168 --> 00:22:41.127
"yes, and," which is, you do not deny another
person's suggestion, you accept it, justify it,

00:22:41.207 --> 00:22:47.179
and then add your own aspect to it. That whole
mentality is such a great way to look at most of

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:50.972
your social aspects in life, you know? Where you
can take someone else's idea, whether or not you

00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:55.984
agree with it, in a group setting, you can take
what they have and add something to it to try and

00:22:55.984 --> 00:23:00.672
bring it closer to where you wanted it to be, and
it's more a positive loop than a negative one.

00:23:00.739 --> 00:23:05.131
MARISHA: And the reason why they do that, the
reason why that rule is there, is because as soon

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:10.464
as someone denies you something, it does two
things. One, it makes the person who was setting up

00:23:10.464 --> 00:23:18.162
their point look like an asshole. You immediately
just rip the rug out from under them. Two, it

00:23:18.162 --> 00:23:24.692
stops the scene. So say for example if I was like,
"Hey Matt, isn't this ski slope totally awesome today?"

00:23:24.745 --> 00:23:27.862
MATT: "No, we're not on a ski slope. We're in a
store. What are you talking about?"

00:23:27.862 --> 00:23:29.282
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (laughs)

00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:30.862
MARISHA: Now I look like a fuckin' asshole!

00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:33.021
(laughter)

00:23:33.021 --> 00:23:39.491
MARISHA: And then you can't go anywhere from that.
That's it. Done. But if I'm like: "Hey, this ski

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:42.962
"slope totally crushes some snow." I don't ski.

00:23:42.962 --> 00:23:44.423
(laughter)

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:49.621
MATT: "Yeah, but the snow's getting kind of slick,
it's almost like it's ice. Wait! This is an ice volcano!"

00:23:49.621 --> 00:23:51.032
(laughter)

00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:54.702
MARISHA: "What! Oh my god, I didn't know! You
didn't tell me we were going to the ice volcano, bro!"

00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:56.609
MATT: "Happy birthday!"

00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:58.319
BOTH: (yelling)

00:23:58.409 --> 00:23:59.762
(laughter and applause)

00:23:59.762 --> 00:24:07.663
MARISHA: See how, when you accept it and you're
just like, "Ice volcano? Totally!" It gives you

00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:14.691
permission to keep going and it builds on it. I
think that's very important and people ask me all

00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:21.272
the time, what was your worst DM experience? I was
playing a Buffy the Vampire Slayer tabletop RPG,

00:24:21.272 --> 00:24:29.012
and I was a pyromancer. And I was used to him
being like, "How do you want to do this?" So I got

00:24:29.102 --> 00:24:33.132
a kill, and in my head I heard Matt going, "How do
you want to do this?" But it was a different DM.

00:24:33.132 --> 00:24:39.751
So I was like, "All right, so what happens is, my
character concentrates, and then a little fireball

00:24:39.751 --> 00:24:44.974
"starts hovering over my head, and then it arcs
across the room, and then it just (poofs)

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:50.852
"and it lights the vampire on fire and they die in a
blazing flame of glory!" And the DM, I swear to

00:24:50.882 --> 00:24:58.571
God, goes, "Yeah, you know pyromancy doesn't
really work that way." And I was like, "Well,

00:24:58.571 --> 00:25:03.320
that's funny you mention that, because pyromancy
doesn't exist!

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.609
(laughter)

00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:09.712
MARISHA: "It's not like a real thing. We're
playing pretend! Does it matter? Does it really

00:25:09.712 --> 00:25:11.028
"ultimately matter?"

00:25:11.028 --> 00:25:12.270
MATT: It's already dying!

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.331
MARISHA: It's already dead! Yeah! Does it matter
how I kill it?

00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:18.463
MATT: (snide tone) Pyromancy is actually just, you
walk up to the vampire and light it on fire with

00:25:18.463 --> 00:25:19.692
your lighter.

00:25:19.692 --> 00:25:21.002
(laughter)

00:25:21.002 --> 00:25:22.330
MATT: It's more of a skill trait.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.800
MARISHA: His response was, "The way pyromancy
actually works, it's more that you just, like,

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.795
"meditate really hard, and then whatever you're
meditating on just bursts into flame." And I'm

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:34.843
like, "Hmm, that's so cinematic. So cool. I'm just
going to--"

00:25:34.843 --> 00:25:36.871
MATT: Or so different from what you suggested.

00:25:36.871 --> 00:25:47.731
MARISHA: Yeah! It's just giving people permission
to keep going. That positive loop, that positive

00:25:47.731 --> 00:25:48.853
feedback.

00:25:48.853 --> 00:25:53.357
MATT: Mind you, if she wasn't a pyromancer and did
that, you might be like, "Well, you don't really

00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:55.112
"have any fire powers. That's a little weird."

00:25:55.112 --> 00:25:56.141
(laughter)

00:25:56.141 --> 00:25:57.233
MATT: There's a line.

00:25:57.233 --> 00:26:00.614
MARISHA: If I was just a vampire slayer and didn't
have magical abilities, then that would be one thing.

00:26:00.696 --> 00:26:06.672
MATT: If it's not going to change the way the game
plays, and it's cool cinematically, and it makes

00:26:06.672 --> 00:26:12.232
the player smile as they describe it, there's no
harm in letting most aspects of that suggestion go

00:26:12.232 --> 00:26:16.187
through. You can even tweak it a little and tone
it down as a reversal, but still maintain the core

00:26:16.187 --> 00:26:22.391
of it and they still have as much fun. To get back
to your question, outside of improv? Who knows

00:26:22.391 --> 00:26:28.301
what's going to happen in the game anyway, but you
want to be comfortable going into it. So best you

00:26:28.301 --> 00:26:33.241
can, try and think of a number of alternate
possible routes. You don't have to flesh them out

00:26:33.241 --> 00:26:38.681
dramatically. Even have a few little bullet points
of "Well if they go to the left, they might find a

00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:47.652
"hive of ropers. Or if they end up going to the
right-hand side of this cavern structure, there's

00:26:47.652 --> 00:26:54.983
"a long crevasse that leads down into a small
society of fungus men." And that might never

00:26:54.983 --> 00:26:59.521
happen. But if they end up going to the right, you
at least have some idea of where they're going. It

00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:04.143
also helps to have a little Rolodex or a
collection of note cards with random NPCs. If you

00:27:04.199 --> 00:27:09.101
have free time, just create random characters.
They don't necessarily fit in your world, but if

00:27:09.101 --> 00:27:13.460
someone all of a sudden decides, "I want to go ahead 
and see who lives in that far house you mentioned

00:27:13.508 --> 00:27:16.857
"three sessions ago on the outskirts of the
farmland." You're like "Uh..."

00:27:16.857 --> 00:27:21.271
MARISHA: Or Percy's like, "Where can I go to buy
black powder?"

00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:27.311
(applause)

00:27:27.311 --> 00:27:29.430
MATT: Another very valid example.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:34.592
MARISHA: Or if, who was it? Laura Bailey is like,
"Where can we go to find a map? I need a map maker."

00:27:34.592 --> 00:27:36.724
(sad noises)

00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:38.343
MARISHA: Too soon, I guess.

00:27:38.343 --> 00:27:39.542
MATT: Shh, no spoilers.

00:27:39.542 --> 00:27:40.908
(laughter)

00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:46.259
MATT: By the way, guys, this is a no-spoiler zone,
for the record. Best we can. We can talk about

00:27:46.328 --> 00:27:50.950
loose things, but especially from the show last
Thursday or the past couple of weeks, try and be

00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:53.988
careful not to spoil anything for those who
aren't completely caught up, because it is a lot

00:27:54.081 --> 00:27:56.289
to catch up on for some people.

00:27:56.289 --> 00:27:57.914
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. Five episodes left.

00:27:57.914 --> 00:28:05.849
MATT: You're getting there! You're getting there!
Yeah, so loosely preparing where you can, but I

00:28:05.849 --> 00:28:09.811
cannot stress enough, no matter how much you
prepare, you will always be caught off-guard.

00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:14.778
That's what makes it fun as a GM. You kind of have
to embrace that chaos and just see where it takes

00:28:14.778 --> 00:28:20.415
you. Spend some time throwing a couple things in
the world that could be tools in your toolbox if

00:28:20.415 --> 00:28:25.209
that situation arises so you're not completely 
left out in the void. But through those

00:28:25.257 --> 00:28:29.247
experiences you'll eventually become more
comfortable just seeing where it takes you when you

00:28:29.247 --> 00:28:31.599
have no idea what's happening.

00:28:31.668 --> 00:28:32.797
MARISHA: Next question.

00:28:32.797 --> 00:28:34.278
MATT: You pick.

00:28:34.278 --> 00:28:36.399
MARISHA: Your hand went up pretty fast. Yeah.

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:39.118
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I guess we're doing the standing
thing.

00:28:39.118 --> 00:28:40.300
MARISHA: Go for it.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.747
AUDIENCE MEMBER: In my experience, having couples
in a game generally puts an expiration date on

00:28:46.747 --> 00:28:49.588
that game. Nothing will stop a game faster--

00:28:49.588 --> 00:28:51.078
MATT: I'm breaking up with you.

00:28:51.078 --> 00:28:56.085
(laughter)

00:28:56.155 --> 00:28:58.083
MARISHA: What was your question?

00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:00.759
(laughter)

00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:06.224
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Your game is, like, 50% couples at
this point, unless I really misunderstood the

00:29:06.224 --> 00:29:08.224
question and answer episode.

00:29:08.224 --> 00:29:11.952
MATT: No, no, that's true. We are, Laura and
Travis, Liam and Sam.

00:29:11.952 --> 00:29:13.113
(laughter)

00:29:13.113 --> 00:29:15.144
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:23.781
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How does it change a session to
have people together in real life who aren't

00:29:23.781 --> 00:29:28.233
necessarily together in the game? And then there's
role-playing. Because I've only had bad

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:29.275
experiences.

00:29:29.275 --> 00:29:30.374
MARISHA: That's a great question.

00:29:30.374 --> 00:29:32.639
MATT: Right. It depends on the people you're
playing with.

00:29:32.662 --> 00:29:35.394
MARISHA: Real quick, for those of you in the back
who might not have heard the question, he said,

00:29:35.394 --> 00:29:40.016
"How do you deal with couples in games because
that tends to put an expiration date either on the

00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:41.909
"game or the couple."

00:29:42.043 --> 00:29:43.455
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Or both!

00:29:43.455 --> 00:29:51.969
MATT: First, you always have to gauge the players
who are involved. If there is a concern of player

00:29:51.969 --> 00:29:56.445
characters forming romances, there being any sort
of role-playing-- like in our game, we have

00:29:56.445 --> 00:30:01.384
Marisha's character Keyleth and Liam's character
have this Ross/Rachel romance that's been going

00:30:01.384 --> 00:30:08.801
for a while now. We're also performers and we're
all friends beforehand and we're mature, and Liam,

00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:14.525
even before he began to pursue this, came up to me
as the DM and was like, "I'm feeling Vax might be

00:30:14.587 --> 00:30:19.793
"building these feelings towards Keyleth, but I
don't want to pursue that for the story if it's

00:30:19.793 --> 00:30:23.192
"weird at all." I was like, "No, it's fine!"
because I know he's a performer and we know

00:30:23.192 --> 00:30:27.832
that separation between character and
self. However, not everyone can be as mature or as

00:30:27.885 --> 00:30:31.570
trained to be able to keep that separation and
some people might be more jealous than others, and

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.290
I have seen people who have been couples that game
together and it's caused strain. You have to gauge

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.947
the players and the atmosphere of who you're
playing with and if you don't think or have any

00:30:39.947 --> 00:30:45.963
question that the atmosphere can facilitate that,
then just don't do it. It's not a necessary aspect

00:30:45.963 --> 00:30:51.047
of it, or at least minimize it to the point where
it isn't this dramatic moonlit sequence where

00:30:51.047 --> 00:30:55.131
they're both staring into each other's eyes and
you have to sit there and watch your wife bare

00:30:55.131 --> 00:31:00.230
her soul to the guy who every now and then looks
over to you and gives you an eyebrow raise.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.575
(laughter)

00:31:01.575 --> 00:31:07.421
MATT: Sending you texts like, "I'm coming for her,
dude." That'll be a problem. You have to gauge the

00:31:07.494 --> 00:31:14.600
maturity level, and if there is a concern, then
don't invite it. Because it gets messy. After

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:20.293
you've played with them for a while and you know
the dynamic between you as friends and in the game

00:31:20.293 --> 00:31:24.007
and you feel it can be something that can be
done, by all means. If it's a newer gaming group

00:31:24.072 --> 00:31:30.151
or people you don't have a long-term friendship
with and can get a bead on how they play with

00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:35.669
that, you've got to be a little careful. As far as
DMing her, she does not put me on the couch when

00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:40.270
bad things happen to Keyleth like the internet
seems to suggest.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.452
MARISHA: Every episode, it doesn't matter. You
could do something amazing and, "Oh, Matt's

00:31:45.452 --> 00:31:49.677
"getting on the couch tonight!" I'm like, sure.

00:31:49.677 --> 00:31:51.181
MATT: It's a comfy couch.

00:31:51.181 --> 00:31:53.499
MARISHA: It's a nice couch. He'll be fine.

00:31:53.499 --> 00:31:55.500
MATT: Yeah, so--

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:05.912
MARISHA: There's a separation. We're not insane
enough, yet, to where we don't recognize the

00:32:05.912 --> 00:32:13.161
separation. I'd be lying if I said we didn't
absolutely get 100% emotional about our characters

00:32:13.161 --> 00:32:19.048
and about things that happen in the game, but I
think those two things aren't mutually exclusive.

00:32:19.048 --> 00:32:27.570
You can get emotional and you can have feelings
and realize it's still just a game and it's still

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:34.765
just pretend. It still doesn't mean that this game
for us hasn't been incredibly important and even

00:32:34.765 --> 00:32:41.880
though it is just pretend, it's not. It's so much
more at this point, it's hard to quantify.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.890
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:49.382
MATT: Boys, if you're playing in a game and your
girlfriend's the Dungeon Master, and your

00:32:49.382 --> 00:32:55.271
character dies, it's not her fault, it's how the
game goes. Ladies, if you're the Dungeon Master

00:32:55.271 --> 00:33:00.220
and you kill off your boyfriend's character, don't
do it just because you can.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.425
(laughter)

00:33:02.425 --> 00:33:06.839
MATT: That goes for both roles, but the idea is
just to respect the fact that death happens in the

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:12.461
game, difficult circumstances happen, and unless
you really did something to piss them off the week

00:33:12.461 --> 00:33:15.498
beforehand and you think this is getting back at
you, in which case you probably deserve it and

00:33:15.498 --> 00:33:16.908
just keep your mouth shut anyway.

00:33:16.908 --> 00:33:18.799
(laughter)

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:21.445
MATT: Just understand it does happen, don't take
it personally.

00:33:21.445 --> 00:33:34.057
Next question. Let's go in the back. Let's see,
you, sir, in the purple shirt rolled up to your elbows.

00:33:34.057 --> 00:33:45.247
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I guess this connects to the last
question. I've had a couple of games where I've

00:33:45.247 --> 00:33:51.079
run where-- How do you manage in-game salt?

00:33:51.079 --> 00:33:56.049
MARISHA: In-game assault?

00:33:56.049 --> 00:33:58.206
MATT: Salt, anger.

00:33:58.206 --> 00:34:01.307
MARISHA: Oh, salt! I was like, "What is happening
at your games?!"

00:34:01.307 --> 00:34:03.036
(laughter)

00:34:03.036 --> 00:34:05.997
MARISHA: Is it a fight club you're running? Jeez.
In-game salt.

00:34:05.997 --> 00:34:07.729
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:34:07.729 --> 00:34:11.152
MATT: Roll save vs. pillar.

00:34:11.152 --> 00:34:13.117
(laughter)

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:19.878
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sometimes people lose control of
the game and they don't play well with each other.

00:34:19.878 --> 00:34:22.336
MATT: It does happen.

00:34:22.336 --> 00:34:32.538
AUDIENCE MEMBER: In a college game, we had a lot
of different people playing, and it does seem hard

00:34:32.538 --> 00:34:39.816
to get together. How do you manage people in that
sense?

00:34:39.816 --> 00:34:43.368
MATT: Totally. It's a valid question. For those of
you who didn't hear it, how do you manage a game

00:34:43.368 --> 00:34:50.284
for many different types of people who want
different things out of the game that can cause

00:34:50.284 --> 00:34:58.187
conflict and sometimes strife within the gaming
group, both in-character and outside. One, I would

00:34:58.187 --> 00:35:04.155
be very clear with all the players before you even
start playing what kind of game you want to run

00:35:04.155 --> 00:35:09.667
and what everyone wants out of it. It's very hard
to run a game that will appease all the hardcore

00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:17.388
roleplayer theater geeks and all the
number-crunching min-maxer Diablo-style kill shit

00:35:17.388 --> 00:35:22.173
and take loot gamers. You can find a happy medium,
but you have to make sure everyone's on board for

00:35:22.173 --> 00:35:26.270
the happy medium before you get too deep into the
game, otherwise you're going to have the party

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:30.678
trying to pull totally different things out and
frustrated when none of them are getting exactly

00:35:30.678 --> 00:35:34.205
what they want. You want to make sure that
everyone understands what you're shooting for,

00:35:34.205 --> 00:35:38.217
that everyone in the party expresses what they
want for their own fun, because even though it's

00:35:38.217 --> 00:35:42.866
your game as the dungeon master, everyone brings
something to that table and you have to make sure

00:35:42.866 --> 00:35:48.579
that-- it's part of your job to make sure everyone
is still having a good time. Two, not all gamers

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:52.346
will gel. There are plenty of people that I had a
good time playing with, but I know that these

00:35:52.346 --> 00:35:57.147
gamers would do terrible in a group together. I've
run different sessions that have been fun, but I

00:35:57.147 --> 00:36:01.977
know I couldn't cross those parties, they would
tear each other apart. That just comes from

00:36:01.977 --> 00:36:08.635
experience and reading it based on those
discussions. Also, if any of these issues start

00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:13.396
arising during the game, talk to them outside of
the game. After the session ends, if you felt any

00:36:13.396 --> 00:36:17.166
of that weirdness? Shoot an email off, make a
phone call to them individually and be like, "Hey,

00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:20.428
"I felt some strange stuff going on here. Do you
have any concerns or anything you want to talk

00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:25.888
"about?" Just hear them out. Don't combat it, don't
try and shut them down. Just like any personal

00:36:25.888 --> 00:36:29.653
interaction, listen to what their feelings are,
whether or not you agree with that. Let them get

00:36:29.653 --> 00:36:34.257
it out and then from there try and explain as to
what you're trying to accomplish with the game and

00:36:34.257 --> 00:36:39.285
ask the question: Is this the kind of game for
you? If the person can go ahead and work towards

00:36:39.285 --> 00:36:45.896
that collaborative storytelling experience and try
and compromise for the sake of the entire story

00:36:45.896 --> 00:36:50.666
and the group what it is they're selfishly wanting
versus what the whole group wants, then you'll be

00:36:50.666 --> 00:36:55.086
fine. If not, maybe they need to find another
group that suits their needs as a gamer. There's

00:36:55.086 --> 00:37:01.168
nothing wrong with that at all. I played many
games with people that-- we don't blend as gamers,

00:37:01.168 --> 00:37:06.708
but I wish them well in the stuff they do and I
don't hold anything against them for that.

00:37:06.708 --> 00:37:14.509
MARISHA: Going off on this as a player and talking
to everyone else out there who are players, be

00:37:14.509 --> 00:37:19.925
kind to your DM. Not only because he can kill you
at any moment, but--

00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:21.438
MATT: (laughs)

00:37:21.438 --> 00:37:27.299
MARISHA: Respect your DM and respect the time that
has been put into these games because that's-- Not

00:37:27.299 --> 00:37:34.630
necessarily this is what you were saying, but you
will sometimes have one of those players that gets

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:41.377
in and has that bull in a china shop type of
mentality and just wants to take over a little

00:37:41.377 --> 00:37:49.028
bit. There's nothing wrong-- and to dungeon
masters, there's nothing wrong with being like,

00:37:49.028 --> 00:37:55.966
"Hey, that's not cool." Because, do understand,
players, that your DM has put in probably at least

00:37:55.966 --> 00:38:02.405
an hour if not more for each hour you play of game
time. There's already probably been ten

00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:08.489
hours of prep before you even showed up to the
game. You're all there for fun, and it's a blast,

00:38:08.489 --> 00:38:14.048
and it's awesome, but there is-- There's a line.
You guys know what I'm talking about, where

00:38:14.048 --> 00:38:20.998
there's a line of being respectful and having fun
and joining in as a group as opposed to mocking it and--

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:23.754
MATT: Trying to get a rise out of the other
players or out of the DM.

00:38:23.754 --> 00:38:28.135
MARISHA: Right, or trying to hijack the whole
game. Which is disrespectful not only to your

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:34.289
dungeon master but to everyone else who's set
aside time to be there. You know, D&amp;D, it's co-op.

00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:40.254
You're working to build a story together, and if
you can do that and find a group with good

00:38:40.254 --> 00:38:43.998
chemistry that can do that, that's when you'll be
the most magical of moments.

00:38:43.998 --> 00:38:50.045
MATT: If a person isn't working out, especially
if you're the one that's running the game, you

00:38:50.045 --> 00:38:53.163
invited them to be a part of your story and your
gaming experience. If you don't think it's going

00:38:53.163 --> 00:38:58.463
to work, you have every right to not invite them
back. If you explain to them why, and in a very

00:38:58.463 --> 00:39:02.097
rational and very respectful way and they still
can't handle it, then that's just even more of a

00:39:02.097 --> 00:39:06.986
clarification as to why this probably shouldn't
continue with them as part of your story. Most

00:39:06.986 --> 00:39:13.194
times in my experience, people will be more
understanding and a lot of times they're just not

00:39:13.194 --> 00:39:18.532
aware of it. Once that discussion happens, "Oh, I
didn't realize I was acting that way," or "I see

00:39:18.532 --> 00:39:24.173
"what you're going with, okay. Now that I'm aware,
I'll try not to act that way anymore." I'm a firm

00:39:24.173 --> 00:39:28.259
believer that 90% of the world's problems are
based on misunderstandings and through

00:39:28.259 --> 00:39:33.784
communication we can solve 90% of the world's
problems. Doesn't mean we will, but I believe

00:39:33.784 --> 00:39:35.252
that's the case. (laughs)

00:39:35.252 --> 00:39:40.944
MARISHA: Yeah. Does that make sense? We're not trying
to be a fun police, there's a difference here, right?

00:39:40.957 --> 00:39:41.963
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:43.825
MARISHA: Makes sense? Okay. Your fun is wrong!

00:39:43.825 --> 00:39:45.054
MATT: I was waiting for it!

00:39:45.054 --> 00:39:47.652
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not trying to do that. Yeah.
Next question?

00:39:47.652 --> 00:39:48.642
MATT: You pick.

00:39:48.642 --> 00:39:50.462
MARISHA: Okay. You had your hand up, yeah.

00:39:50.462 --> 00:39:55.214
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This actually ties into that last
question because you guys had that with Tiberius

00:39:55.214 --> 00:40:01.155
leaving, and I know that it's been said it was a
very amiable leave and you guys are all still

00:40:01.155 --> 00:40:04.791
friends and everything. Is there any chance that
he-- maybe not come back permanently, but would

00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:10.694
come back and pop in and do a one-shot type thing
with you or come in and guest star for one episode?

00:40:10.778 --> 00:40:13.005
MATT: (sighs)

00:40:13.005 --> 00:40:16.551
(laughter)

00:40:16.551 --> 00:40:18.524
MATT: Uh.

00:40:18.524 --> 00:40:22.522
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Next question!

00:40:22.522 --> 00:40:24.803
MATT and MARISHA: (laughs)

00:40:24.803 --> 00:40:26.578
MARISHA: "Yes, and."

00:40:26.578 --> 00:40:32.736
MATT: I will say we have nothing but the utmost
respect and appreciation for everything that Orion

00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:38.585
brought to the show and the character Tiberius in
the time that we did play together. However, some

00:40:38.585 --> 00:40:43.020
circumstances in life come to a point where they
have to go their separate ways. He has his paths

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:47.241
to walk, we have our path to walk and we wish him
well and we've supported him through that entire

00:40:47.241 --> 00:40:53.744
endeavor. What the future holds, I can't say. You
know, circumstances change, people change. I can't

00:40:53.744 --> 00:41:01.163
tell the future, and I like to think the best of
most people in all circumstances. I can't give an

00:41:01.163 --> 00:41:08.883
answer one way or the other. Whatever he's up to,
whatever the future holds, I wish him the best of

00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:13.734
luck and we shall see. (laughs) Next question.

00:41:13.734 --> 00:41:15.470
MARISHA and MATT: (laughs)

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:19.803
MARISHA: Yeah, you in the plaid. Yeah, you. Yeah.

00:41:19.803 --> 00:41:21.833
(laughter)

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:24.914
MATT: There's a lot of plaid suddenly in the
audience.

00:41:24.914 --> 00:41:26.671
(laughter)

00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:30.493
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is more of a DM question.
I'm a new DM, like very new DM.

00:41:30.493 --> 00:41:32.201
MATT: Welcome, yes!

00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:36.720
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm currently homebrewing a
campaign in a world, and where did you even begin

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.253
building your world? What's the process that you
took doing that?

00:41:41.253 --> 00:41:45.612
MATT: This is a great question. It's a great
question, because when it comes to especially

00:41:45.612 --> 00:41:52.154
homebrewing your own content, and as a new DM,
there is nothing more frightening and daunting

00:41:52.154 --> 00:41:53.413
than going "Okay--"

00:41:53.413 --> 00:41:55.222
MARISHA: "I'm going to build a world!"

00:41:55.222 --> 00:41:57.113
MATT: (nervously) "Where do I start?"

00:41:57.113 --> 00:41:59.232
(laughter)

00:41:59.232 --> 00:42:04.722
MATT: Really the biggest thing is to keep it
small. You're not building a world. You're

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:13.641
building a town. You figure out a couple shops,
build maybe a couple dozen NPCs, even less if you

00:42:13.641 --> 00:42:18.494
want to for your first session. Come up with a
couple of factions, like a merchant's guild or

00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:23.862
maybe a sailor's guild. Maybe there's a little
underground thieving ring or a fence that's

00:42:23.862 --> 00:42:29.184
running a darker circuit in the town, and you
just really flesh out this one little town. You

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:35.963
can build two or three adventures that work just
in this town. Then once you play a game with your

00:42:35.963 --> 00:42:42.334
players in that town, what they do, the actions
they take, will inspire you to think of other ways

00:42:42.334 --> 00:42:47.960
that you can expand the world from there. That
town will give you as many sessions as you want

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.925
depending on how much further you want to go into
the rabbit hole of what this town has. There could

00:42:51.925 --> 00:42:56.102
be a whole ruin beneath the town that opens up a
whole subterranean portion of the campaign and

00:42:56.102 --> 00:43:01.893
they've still only been in this one town. Then you
can run ten, 12, 15 more sessions just in this one

00:43:01.893 --> 00:43:07.273
little area. The inspiration of playing in that
one little town will help you build the world. It

00:43:07.273 --> 00:43:13.174
will give you ideas in between. Then you expand to
one of the neighboring towns. Or one of the

00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:19.292
neighboring deserts, which has what used to be a
town that is now completely buried by sand and

00:43:19.292 --> 00:43:24.262
the elements have destroyed but there's now a tribal
society of rather unscrupulous individuals that

00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:28.642
are now attacking caravans from the first town.
Now you can flesh out where that is. Maybe there's

00:43:28.642 --> 00:43:32.171
a small society there where they're actually not
that bad, they're just trying to survive, but

00:43:32.171 --> 00:43:36.281
they're being kept at bay by these subterranean
desert creatures that are now starting to rise up

00:43:36.281 --> 00:43:40.479
and fight them and there's now three sessions you
could do with this other secondary desert

00:43:40.554 --> 00:43:47.733
civilization. You've done 15 to 20 sessions with
two towns. You don't have to create-- I don't know

00:43:47.733 --> 00:43:49.682
where any of that came from, by the way, you're
welcome to use it--

00:43:49.682 --> 00:43:51.712
(laughter)

00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:56.999
MATT: Those are just two locations where you can
run many, many sessions, and that's building your

00:43:56.999 --> 00:44:03.311
own homebrew world, but you didn't have to create
the world. It's very hard for you to do that. When

00:44:03.311 --> 00:44:07.822
I began running their game I created Stilben, and
that was for the first two sessions. Then I

00:44:07.822 --> 00:44:14.262
created Westruun, and that was for the next six
sessions? These are eight-hour, big sessions that

00:44:14.262 --> 00:44:18.983
we could only play once every four to six weeks. I
didn't have Tal'Dorei figured out until they were

00:44:19.066 --> 00:44:23.851
getting towards the end of Westruun's arc, towards
the first Winter's Crest festival and I was like,

00:44:23.851 --> 00:44:27.473
"Well, I've just started developing the Clasp, and
there's a part of the Clasp here in Westruun, but

00:44:27.473 --> 00:44:31.412
"there's got to be a major center for the Clasp,
there has to be a major center to this continent

00:44:31.457 --> 00:44:36.752
"they're on." And I began to develop Emon, and that
was leading up to the Winter's Crest festival, and

00:44:36.823 --> 00:44:39.671
when they finished up with that then I could lead
them towards Emon, and then I began to flesh out

00:44:39.671 --> 00:44:45.024
Emon, the more they expressed it-- It's very much
like trying to catch up to the train while being

00:44:45.024 --> 00:44:49.970
on the tracks. You're like, "Okay, and then what's
happening next week? Next week I get the feeling

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:55.201
"they might want to go ahead and check out this
petting zoo." Sure, let's flesh out the petting zoo.

00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:57.448
(laughter)

00:44:57.448 --> 00:45:00.823
MARISHA: Now there's still so many times where I'm
like, "How did you know we were going to do that?"

00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:06.404
You had some inkling that we were going to do that
and I don't know why you just-- someone just said

00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:10.262
something in passing and you're like, "They're
going to do that."

00:45:10.262 --> 00:45:13.606
MATT: Here's the key. I have six inklings of what
you're going to do and I try and prep some of all

00:45:13.662 --> 00:45:17.102
six, so when you choose one of them I go, "I
totally had that figured out."

00:45:17.102 --> 00:45:18.980
(laughter)

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:24.592
MATT: Or when you pick one that wasn't one of the
six and I go, (weakly) "Oh, I totally have that

00:45:24.592 --> 00:45:25.835
"figured out."

00:45:25.835 --> 00:45:27.092
(laughter)

00:45:27.092 --> 00:45:33.999
MARISHA: My favorite was when we walked into the
back door of the Clasp, of the thieves' guild, and

00:45:34.035 --> 00:45:38.682
he wasn't prepared for it. Man, that was a good
game.

00:45:38.682 --> 00:45:40.931
(laughter)

00:45:40.931 --> 00:45:44.725
MARISHA: That was great. We just were like, "Yeah,
let's do this now," and I'll still never forget

00:45:44.725 --> 00:45:49.732
your face when you were like: (clicks tongue)
"Okay, then."

00:45:49.732 --> 00:45:50.876
(laughter)

00:45:50.876 --> 00:45:54.392
MATT: I'm like, yeah, we got like three more sessions
before they actually meet up with the Clasp and

00:45:54.439 --> 00:45:56.353
there's stuff to-- Where are you going?

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:57.628
MARISHA: You're walking in the back door, all
right.

00:45:57.628 --> 00:45:58.711
MATT: Come on in!

00:45:58.711 --> 00:46:02.011
MARISHA: You're basically like, (knocks) "Hey! Yo,
what's up, Clasp?" Yeah, we kind of went in the

00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:11.201
back door and-- Yeah. (laughs) And Matt rolls out
one of the dry-erasable marker grids and starts

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:15.101
just drawing the Clasp. "This is where the Clasp
lives."

00:46:15.101 --> 00:46:16.912
MATT: We're going off grid, folks. We're off
grid.

00:46:16.912 --> 00:46:18.641
(laughter)

00:46:18.641 --> 00:46:21.031
MARISHA: Here we go. Good times.

00:46:21.031 --> 00:46:22.488
MATT: So yeah. It's going to go weird.

00:46:22.488 --> 00:46:27.113
MARISHA: I imagine it's kind of like when you
start an RPG and there's the fog of war on the map

00:46:27.113 --> 00:46:33.940
and you kind of slowly flesh out the map as you
explore and you just kind of lose the map fog. I

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.617
think he builds in the same way.

00:46:35.617 --> 00:46:36.505
MATT: Yeah.

00:46:36.505 --> 00:46:38.042
MARISHA: I can't say. I'm not speaking for him.

00:46:38.042 --> 00:46:42.753
MATT: Yeah. But if-- and you want to, just make up
names of places. Be like, "What's a good name for

00:46:42.753 --> 00:46:44.732
"an elven city?" Zorvana.

00:46:44.732 --> 00:46:45.889
MARISHA: Purvan.

00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:47.839
MATT: Right? Thank you. What'd you say?

00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:48.827
MARISHA: Purvan.

00:46:48.827 --> 00:46:49.822
(laughter)

00:46:49.822 --> 00:46:50.997
MATT: That's a real name!

00:46:50.997 --> 00:46:53.831
(applause)

00:46:53.831 --> 00:46:57.102
MATT: The elven city of Purvan.

00:46:57.102 --> 00:46:58.891
(laughter)

00:46:58.891 --> 00:47:02.241
MATT: And someone says, "Well, where are you from
sir?" and I'm like, "Well I hail from the elven

00:47:02.241 --> 00:47:08.137
"city of Purvan." You just made up a name. But now,
down the road, you can then begin developing this

00:47:08.137 --> 00:47:09.622
elven city of Purvan.

00:47:09.622 --> 00:47:11.484
(laughter)

00:47:11.484 --> 00:47:12.520
MARISHA: Perve-on.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.709
MATT: And it sounds like you've had it planned
this whole time because the name was mentioned so

00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:23.029
many sessions ago. It only really clarified a week
ago, but they don't know that. Magic!

00:47:23.029 --> 00:47:27.596
(laughter, applause)

00:47:27.606 --> 00:47:28.735
MARISHA: Next question.

00:47:28.735 --> 00:47:29.682
MATT: Good question.

00:47:29.682 --> 00:47:30.633
MODERATOR: Oh my.

00:47:30.633 --> 00:47:31.631
MARISHA: (screams)

00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:32.834
MATT: Okay, we've got to start moving through
these.

00:47:32.834 --> 00:47:35.031
MARISHA: You pick one. Hey, do we have a panel in
after us?

00:47:35.031 --> 00:47:36.943
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:36.943 --> 00:47:39.285
MATT: Curses!

00:47:39.285 --> 00:47:41.071
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, you've got an 18+.

00:47:41.071 --> 00:47:42.852
MARISHA: All right, let's keep going. Oh, we have
18+ after us?

00:47:42.852 --> 00:47:43.973
MATT: We've got 15 minutes.

00:47:43.973 --> 00:47:44.895
MARISHA: Okay. Go, go.

00:47:44.989 --> 00:47:47.205
MATT: We're going to start trying to make this
go a little faster so we can get through as many

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:53.243
questions. You sir, right there in the gray. Yes,
you! Rise!

00:47:53.314 --> 00:47:56.722
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, just for those of us who
are running Curse of Strahd, do you have any

00:47:56.722 --> 00:47:58.713
insights into Strahd?

00:47:58.713 --> 00:48:00.221
MATT: (laughs)

00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:02.351
MARISHA: Just for those who are running Curse of
Strahd?

00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:07.791
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just-- Non-spoilers, I don't know
if you've read the scenario, but insights into the

00:48:07.791 --> 00:48:08.970
character.

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:12.306
MATT: I haven't run the new scenario of course,
I've been running my own. But I've played through

00:48:12.306 --> 00:48:17.088
two different Expedition to Ravenloft campaigns--
played through one and DMed one. Strahd's one of

00:48:17.088 --> 00:48:20.680
my favorite villains. Probably one of the better
villains of all the D&amp;D campaigns for a reason,

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:27.479
because he's a complicated villain. He has a lot
of very interesting things going on internally,

00:48:27.479 --> 00:48:34.567
and not all encounters are about seeing Strahd,
fighting Strahd. He likes to talk, he likes to

00:48:34.567 --> 00:48:39.939
learn, he likes to take beads on players. If
you're running a game for players, Strahd is

00:48:39.939 --> 00:48:45.816
powerful, and yeah, if he showed up to start a fight
with the characters the second session in, he would wipe

00:48:45.896 --> 00:48:49.952
the floor with them. But sometimes Strahd just 
wants to talk and find out about them, ask them

00:48:49.952 --> 00:48:54.468
questions. Maybe see elements of their history
that nobody should know and start messing with

00:48:54.468 --> 00:48:59.702
their head. Barovia's a strange place like that.
Secrets are traded around and god knows what the

00:48:59.702 --> 00:49:03.262
Vistani manage to hear in the whispers while
you're sleeping and don't realize you're talking

00:49:03.262 --> 00:49:10.560
in your sleep. Such a great place, Barovia. For a
dungeon master. Very scary place for a player.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.460
(laughter)

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.196
MATT: It's hard to say anything without spoiling
the character because there's a lot of intricacy

00:49:15.196 --> 00:49:22.913
to his backstory and a lot of-- his origin story,
his previous love, his brother. There's so many

00:49:22.913 --> 00:49:27.598
aspects of it. But Strahd-- I will say Strahd is
more than the surface Dracula vampire you

00:49:27.598 --> 00:49:34.259
think he may be. There's a lot going on there. For
good or bad, there's a lot going on. Next question.

00:49:34.283 --> 00:49:40.157
MARISHA: Let's do in the back, yeah, you who's
going like this. Yes, you.

00:49:40.157 --> 00:49:42.291
MATT: Sometimes it helps to flail.

00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:50.742
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I watch Critical Role and all
that and I was just wondering-- I was just

00:49:50.742 --> 00:49:57.519
wondering as a DM and aspiring possible voice
actor-- I want to try to do that in the future--

00:49:57.519 --> 00:50:05.612
What are some tips you could possibly give DMs as
well as actors?

00:50:05.612 --> 00:50:07.902
MATT: Let's see. One--

00:50:07.902 --> 00:50:10.102
MARISHA: That's deep. That's a big question.

00:50:10.102 --> 00:50:16.823
MATT: I'll try and make this as concise as
possible. Improv classes once again, huge benefit

00:50:16.823 --> 00:50:21.891
both as a player and as-- I mean, look at Sam. Sam
was at UCB for a long time and it shows. He is so

00:50:21.902 --> 00:50:24.163
fast, even if he has no idea what the hell is
going on.

00:50:24.163 --> 00:50:25.403
(laughter)

00:50:25.403 --> 00:50:31.882
MATT: So it helps both sides, the player and as a
DM. It's great. But when you have free time on the

00:50:31.882 --> 00:50:37.634
freeway driving in traffic, practice voices,
improvise dialogue yourself. I'm that crazy guy on

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:42.081
the road that's talking to himself and everyone
else is like, what the hell is that guy doing over there?

00:50:42.093 --> 00:50:43.282
(laughter)

00:50:43.282 --> 00:50:46.865
MATT: And if you like a voice you have never done
before, pull out your phone real fast and record 30

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:50.572
seconds of you just talking in it, because now you
have something to go back to to remind yourself of

00:50:50.572 --> 00:50:55.340
that and you can assign that to an NPC. Every NPC
that I create, for the most part, I have in

00:50:55.361 --> 00:51:02.672
parentheses at the end of their brief description
a texture, a pitch, and sometimes a dialect. So

00:51:02.672 --> 00:51:09.842
I'll go through something like: relatively thick
Cockney, kind of gritty, low-pitched or be like high

00:51:09.842 --> 00:51:18.531
and reedy voice, more of a thick Scottish,
slightly abrasive. And those are quick notes for

00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:22.486
you to go back to. But you find those voices by
just practicing in the shower when you have time

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.668
to yourself.

00:51:23.668 --> 00:51:28.199
MARISHA: You stopped and looked at me very
expectantly.

00:51:28.199 --> 00:51:29.308
(laughter)

00:51:29.308 --> 00:51:31.003
MARISHA: But yes, I'm ready. I've got something.
I'm good.

00:51:31.003 --> 00:51:32.151
MATT: I thought you were ready.

00:51:32.151 --> 00:51:33.209
MARISHA: I am.

00:51:33.209 --> 00:51:35.045
(laughter)

00:51:35.045 --> 00:51:37.278
MATT: The illusion, see?

00:51:37.278 --> 00:51:46.649
MARISHA: Yes, see. I'm so ready, I'm on top of it.
I've slept today. What was I going to say? A lot

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:53.778
of people ask us-- We are not voice actors and you
guys do all these voices and I want to be a good

00:51:53.778 --> 00:52:01.859
DM like you, but I'm not a voice actor, and you
don't have to have this insane Mel Blanc type of

00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:11.460
range to be a DM. Just even changing the placement
of where the sound comes out in your mouth can be

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:17.248
enough of an identifier. So, for example, I
naturally speak at the back of my throat, which is

00:52:17.248 --> 00:52:22.838
why I've got this gravelly thing, which my
theater teachers hated, but they love it in voice

00:52:22.884 --> 00:52:27.866
over. But if you start moving it more to the front
of your mouth and you start dropping little bit

00:52:27.866 --> 00:52:33.134
more breathy. I didn't change my tonality at all
and this is more where Keyleth lives. It's a

00:52:33.134 --> 00:52:38.828
little gentler, it's a little softer, and you
don't have to necessarily change-- I don't have to

00:52:38.828 --> 00:52:46.260
go to the crazy voice to do anything crazy. It's a
little bit of placement and that can just make a

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:52.350
world of difference. You talk all the time about
voicing women when you DM, and you don't have to

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:54.250
sound like an SNL character.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:53:00.147
MATT: (high-pitched British voice) 'Ello! We've
all done this, DMs, any guy who has ever DMed has

00:53:00.147 --> 00:53:08.889
gone Monty Python. Don't deny it. But sometimes
you just change in physicality too. I can be

00:53:08.889 --> 00:53:13.449
talking to you like this, or I can be talking to
you like this and it's not changing voice, but

00:53:13.449 --> 00:53:18.917
this is an entirely different type of physicality
to a character. If I'm talking the same voice like

00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:22.827
this, but I'm standing up a little with the
shoulders to the front looking down at you, it's

00:53:22.894 --> 00:53:28.455
an entirely different character. No change in
voice, but the physicality can impart an entirely

00:53:28.455 --> 00:53:32.960
different delivery experience of that dialogue,
and engagement is the key. Even if your voice

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:37.569
doesn't change, engaging your players, making eye
contact. And I know it's hard, if you have notes

00:53:37.642 --> 00:53:42.726
down there back and forth, but don't be afraid
that, when you finish your notes or when you're

00:53:42.726 --> 00:53:48.306
feeling comfortable in those little NPC diatribes
to then engage once more, because it's that

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:55.265
contact that, one, helps facilitate the players to
be more into roleplaying in the moment-- it's the

00:53:55.265 --> 00:54:00.136
difference between saying, the shopkeeper offers you a
better deal, then going, "I offer you a better

00:54:00.208 --> 00:54:05.178
"deal." One's a little more engaging. It's the same
circumstance, but it just puts the player in the

00:54:05.178 --> 00:54:09.827
moment where they're having to connect with you,
and that gives them permission to then offer that

00:54:09.827 --> 00:54:13.499
same energy back. And not everyone's going to be
comfortable being that heavy into roleplaying.

00:54:13.499 --> 00:54:18.530
Some folks, it takes a while to come out of their
shell and that's totally fine. Don't ever feel too

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:22.880
frustrated or exhibit that frustration on the
player, encourage them to be more comfortable. And

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:27.317
if they aren't, then it's totally fine, but you
present that opportunity for them to get out of

00:54:27.317 --> 00:54:31.221
their comfort zone and maybe discover something
about themselves they didn't know they had, kind

00:54:31.221 --> 00:54:37.161
of like I did. Anyway, that was a
roundabout answer. All right.

00:54:37.172 --> 00:54:38.844
MARISHA: Oh, I picked him, so you pick.

00:54:38.844 --> 00:54:42.897
MATT: Okay, I'm trying to go through this pretty 
quick round so that we can get through some questions here.

00:54:42.945 --> 00:54:46.252
You have a very nice jacket and collar, I have to
call on you there.

00:54:46.252 --> 00:54:56.927
MARISHA: Oh, you got like a cap thing going on. Is
there a presentation? I feel a presentation coming.

00:54:56.937 --> 00:55:02.235
MATT: Oh no, this is from Fallout, yo. No,
MacCready wore that for a while.

00:55:02.235 --> 00:55:08.006
MODERATOR: Oh my god, it is! Okay, go for it.

00:55:08.006 --> 00:55:10.885
MATT: Question! Oh, we got Preston Garvey.

00:55:10.885 --> 00:55:20.281
MATT: Don't you dare send me to another settlement
that needs help, by the way, guys. I've helped,

00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:23.916
like, 60 of them, and none of them can take care of
themselves!

00:55:23.927 --> 00:55:27.358
MARISHA: I was just there! Damn it! What do you
mean they're getting attacked by bandits?

00:55:27.358 --> 00:55:29.992
MATT: I just killed the ghouls! Ugh. Sorry,
question?

00:55:29.992 --> 00:55:37.060
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I had a bit of a curiosity. As
I've never been one for DMing, it's never been my

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:43.303
style, but I get really into characters a lot. I
build characters in my free time.

00:55:43.303 --> 00:55:48.567
MATT: Mm-hmm, totally. As a DM that's all I can
do.

00:55:48.567 --> 00:55:55.982
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I wanted to know, as voice
actors, have you ever walked into the booth, read

00:55:55.982 --> 00:56:00.701
the script, and realized that you already made the
character you're voicing? That it's been so

00:56:00.701 --> 00:56:07.981
drastically similar that you're like, "Holy shit,
next you're going to tell me that his mom is abusive."

00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:13.672
MARISHA: Yes.

00:56:13.672 --> 00:56:15.889
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do you have a story for it?

00:56:15.889 --> 00:56:22.193
MATT: I have a few. I will say that a lot of the
characters that I audition with, and a lot of the

00:56:22.193 --> 00:56:27.591
characters that I play in video games, started as
NPCs in my old campaigns. Both Eder and Aloth in

00:56:27.591 --> 00:56:34.682
Pillars of Eternity were characters in an old
campaign I ran out of high school. A lot of

00:56:34.682 --> 00:56:40.816
character voices and personalities, for me at
least, I transitioned from the game and then

00:56:40.816 --> 00:56:45.211
brought into my toolbox as a performer. As far as
finding similarities in them, fantasy genre

00:56:45.211 --> 00:56:48.926
especially has its own tropes. Like, "Oh my god,
his parents were also killed when he was young,

00:56:48.926 --> 00:56:54.600
"and he's an orphan wandering the land with power?
Wandering swordsman in search of a purpose, that

00:56:54.600 --> 00:57:01.761
"sounds just like every high school D&amp;D character
ever." So yeah, I've definitely had similarities

00:57:01.761 --> 00:57:04.140
in those regards.

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:13.630
MARISHA: Even the episode not too long ago, so it
shouldn't be huge spoilers, where Grog fought

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:21.978
Earthbreaker Groon, and he called upon Scanlan and
Vax, and he was like, "Where do you get your power

00:57:21.978 --> 00:57:30.238
"from?" "My friends." Everyone was like, "This is
the anime episode!" It's so true. It's so trope-y.

00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:33.372
(applause)

00:57:33.372 --> 00:57:35.301
MARISHA: You just can't help it.

00:57:35.347 --> 00:57:36.742
MATT: Some tropes come from honesty.

00:57:36.742 --> 00:57:38.390
MARISHA: The power of friendship!

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:48.182
MATT: Craven Edge says otherwise. Good question.
You have a question, or we're running out of time?

00:57:48.182 --> 00:57:52.451
AUDIENCE MEMBER: One question. What are your times
for your autograph panels tomorrow?

00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:57.807
MATT: (Strongbad voice) Ah! That is a very good
question. I will look this up with the one percent

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:08.588
on my phone, so it doesn't die. Okay, so tomorrow
on Saturday, we have autographs at 12:30 to 1:30,

00:58:08.588 --> 00:58:12.968
so long as you bring your stuff to get signed,
we'll go ahead and put our signatures on it. Even

00:58:12.968 --> 00:58:17.932
have posters to sell with artwork from Kit Buss
and Critical Role. With Keyleth as an earth

00:58:17.932 --> 00:58:24.059
elemental jumping onto K'Varn. It's really cool,
you should have one. Then on Sunday, we have our

00:58:24.059 --> 00:58:28.829
autograph session from 1:30 to 2:00, so if you
don't come tomorrow, and you're running out of

00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:30.331
time, come on Sunday.

00:58:30.331 --> 00:58:33.151
MARISHA: Thank you, Strongbad.

00:58:33.151 --> 00:58:35.165
MATT: (Strongbad voice) You're welcome.

00:58:35.165 --> 00:58:39.850
(cheering)

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.861
MARISHA: Next question, yes.

00:58:41.861 --> 00:58:44.445
AUDIENCE: Sing "Trogdor!"

00:58:44.445 --> 00:58:49.650
MATT: (singing) Trogdor needs more questions
answered.

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:56.138
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question for Marisha.
What are your times, because I know they're

00:58:56.138 --> 00:58:57.349
different?

00:58:57.349 --> 00:59:00.850
MATT: (singing) They don't know what your times
are.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:09.818
MARISHA: Oh, 11? Really? Apparently, I'm signing
at 11.

00:59:09.818 --> 00:59:12.851
MATT: (singing) Marisha's signing at 11.

00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:26.241
MARISHA: I just go where they tell me to go. Look
on your schedule. Next question. Yeah, you, doing

00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:29.493
ninjutsu. Yeah, you. Yeah, the Rick and Morty,
yeah.

00:59:29.493 --> 00:59:30.780
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, sweet!

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:35.440
MATT: Man, you are prepared for this panel.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.950
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is a week old and it's still
healing, by the way.

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.440
MATT: That looks awesome.

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:45.588
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I knew I was going to come meet
you before this guy named Zombie, but I got a bit

00:59:45.588 --> 00:59:54.296
more of a crunch DM mechanics question. I've been
DMing Pathfinder for a few months shy of a year,

00:59:54.296 --> 01:00:01.488
now, and as far as the difficulty of combat is
concerned, I'm starting to find myself leaning on

01:00:01.488 --> 01:00:08.096
certain things that may be a little less fun for
my players. Like, I've been dealing with the

01:00:08.096 --> 01:00:17.196
tank-y warrior-cleric, with probably a little bit
more grappling than they'd like me to. I've been

01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:24.821
leaning back on reach weapons an annoying amount.
So what do you do to bring a fair challenge

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:32.956
without recycling reach weapons, grappling, cheap
magic spells off a spontaneous caster... How do

01:00:32.956 --> 01:00:35.577
you keep it interesting without getting cheap on
your players?

01:00:35.577 --> 01:00:36.705
MARISHA: Good question.

01:00:36.705 --> 01:00:42.476
MATT: Cheap works, on occasion, but also consider
not all challenges are based just straight on

01:00:42.515 --> 01:00:48.994
damage mechanics and weapon use. Building
interesting and dangerous terrain for a battle can

01:00:48.994 --> 01:00:54.361
make what seems like a relatively pushover combat
into a very, very precarious situation for the

01:00:54.361 --> 01:00:59.418
party. If you have an entire group of individuals
that are across a giant chasm with ranged heavy

01:00:59.418 --> 01:01:04.874
crossbows, and the party can't find a way to get
across because there's perpetual wind blowing up

01:01:04.874 --> 01:01:10.526
across the way, but their bolts are enchanted to be
resistant to the wind as they're native to this

01:01:10.526 --> 01:01:14.424
terrain, that's a way where the party's like, "Oh
crap! We're just being pegged to death from a

01:01:14.487 --> 01:01:19.334
"distance." Or consider fighting in a place that
itself is very fragile, and the terrain itself is

01:01:19.373 --> 01:01:24.111
collapsing during the battle, and elements of it
begin to fall away. We're talking top of Icecrown

01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:31.825
style battle with Arthas. You know who you are, if
you got that reference, because we all suffered in

01:01:31.825 --> 01:01:41.251
torment, trying to finish that fight. Or consider
there could be elements to the battle where the

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:46.118
enemy might be resistant to most damage until you
discover an aspect hidden within the room. Not

01:01:46.118 --> 01:01:50.050
quite like a lich's phylactery, but something that
character is bound to that is hidden within that

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:55.572
battlefield, and so it's half a battle, and half
trying to search and scour the scenery for a means

01:01:55.572 --> 01:02:03.110
of disabling their defenses. Or consider a battle
where there is a large amount of innocents that

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:07.278
are locked away, and the longer the battle goes,
collateral damage and innocents are being killed

01:02:07.278 --> 01:02:11.739
until the party can try and spend more time defending
them versus just keeping the damage onto the enemy--

01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:13.420
MARISHA: Who are you?

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:21.610
MATT: I'm coming up with different ways to fake
challenge! Or it can be enemies that, as opposed

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:26.604
to just dealing damage, it's a very, very high
piece of terrain and they are more about grabbing

01:02:26.604 --> 01:02:32.109
and chucking things off of cliffsides. Or
elemental aspects-- a lightning storm where you

01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:38.074
randomly start striking down on areas of the
battlefield, enemy or friend. I don't know--

01:02:38.074 --> 01:02:42.027
MARISHA: No, keep going. I'm taking notes, mental
notes.

01:02:42.027 --> 01:02:47.418
MATT: These are all just random things that could
add difficulty or challenge to a battle without it

01:02:47.418 --> 01:02:55.351
just being a direct "my guys have longer weapons
than yours," which has its place, but if you find

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.956
yourself recycling those tropes too often, then
think of other things outside of just damage. And if a

01:02:59.996 --> 01:03:04.581
creature you want them to fight doesn't quite have
an interesting toolbox, you can create abilities

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:11.303
that they have beyond what the book tells you.
Perhaps this one brand of giant scorpion lived too

01:03:11.303 --> 01:03:17.301
close to a cluster of long-buried pure arcane
energy and is beginning to mutate these crystals,

01:03:17.301 --> 01:03:23.058
and whenever anybody attacks them with a physical
attack it creates a feedback shockwave of arcane

01:03:23.058 --> 01:03:27.794
energy that does additional damage. Think of
things that you can attach to existing creatures

01:03:27.794 --> 01:03:28.939
to make them different.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:33.094
I'm getting the wrap-up sign, which means I failed
at answering questions rapidly, but I think

01:03:33.127 --> 01:03:35.109
that's the nature of the panel.

01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:38.908
MARISHA: One more quick question, guys--

01:03:38.908 --> 01:03:40.690
MATT: --and we're out of here. You pick.

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:44.979
MARISHA: Oh boy. You look so eager back there.
Yes!

01:03:44.979 --> 01:03:56.470
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I run an RPG group at my local
library. It's my first time DMing, so I'm really

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.168
nervous. Advice?

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.220
MARISHA: First-time DM tips?

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:10.500
MATT: "Nervous" is part of it. Harness the nervous
energy, that's what'll propel you when you're in

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:16.102
that seat of not knowing what's happening.
Understand that it's okay to be nervous and be

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.538
afraid of what's happening.

01:04:17.538 --> 01:04:21.531
MARISHA: Use the adrenaline rush. The 
adrenaline is real.

01:04:21.531 --> 01:04:27.273
MATT: Biggest advice I would give for this
circumstance is one, have a chance to chat with

01:04:27.273 --> 01:04:31.168
the players enough if they're people you don't
know very well originally. Meet with them each

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:35.035
individually for lunch and get to know them as a
person beforehand so you kind of know what you're

01:04:35.093 --> 01:04:38.553
getting into before you start the game. Also
asking them what they want out of the game so you

01:04:38.553 --> 01:04:42.328
can tailor a story that hopefully they'll all be
happy with and get what they want out of the

01:04:42.328 --> 01:04:47.128
experience. And kind of what I said before,
prepare as best you can, but don't over-prepare,

01:04:47.128 --> 01:04:51.106
because if you over-prepare one or two major paths
and they end up completely veering off to the

01:04:51.106 --> 01:04:56.113
side, you will have spent all those hours on
something that no one will ever see, and have no

01:04:56.113 --> 01:04:59.975
idea what's going on. Or, conversely, try and find
ways you can redirect the story back towards what

01:04:59.975 --> 01:05:05.736
you had prepared. So I would recommend, as opposed
to really fleshing out one path, loosely flesh out

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:10.988
multiple paths, and give that opportunity where
you feel like you have kind of a handhold on what's

01:05:10.988 --> 01:05:16.028
happening, but not fully, as opposed to having a
really good grasp on one path and if it goes any

01:05:16.028 --> 01:05:18.916
other way, you're screwed. I hope that's helpful.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:25.237
MARISHA: Let's do one more quick question that's a
good closer. Let's do up front, yeah.

01:05:25.237 --> 01:05:31.634
AUDIENCE: Mr. Mercer, what is your favorite part
of DMing? And, Ms. Marisha, what is your favorite

01:05:31.634 --> 01:05:34.253
part of playing with Mr. Mercer?

01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:35.484
MATT: You first.

01:05:35.484 --> 01:05:42.247
MARISHA: My favorite part of playing Dungeons &amp;
Dragons, just in general, as a part of any game,

01:05:42.247 --> 01:05:50.944
is the ability to have dreams later on in that
world and be like, "Oh, shit, my brain just thinks

01:05:50.944 --> 01:05:53.434
"that all actually happened, and I'm kind of okay
with that."

01:05:53.434 --> 01:05:55.332
(laughter)

01:05:55.332 --> 01:06:02.807
MARISHA: I'm kind of okay with looking back at the
memories of me having that Orlando trip in sixth

01:06:02.807 --> 01:06:10.414
grade and the memories I have of fighting a beholder are
pretty much the exact same in my head, so... dope.

01:06:10.502 --> 01:06:24.934
MATT: My favorite part of being a GM, or DM, is,
every time you describe to a player the reaction

01:06:24.934 --> 01:06:33.524
to an action they took that they were trying for
and were successful-- or a massive failure-- but

01:06:33.524 --> 01:06:40.485
some sort of reaction to an action that they attempted,
and watching them light up and smile as they

01:06:40.485 --> 01:06:48.295
suddenly realize that they've driven a part of the
story forward, and they realize that they have as

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:53.369
much agency and the ability to create in the space
as you do, and that to me is above and beyond the

01:06:53.369 --> 01:06:56.836
gift of being a DM, is watching other people create
in the world that you created.

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:58.476
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:06:58.476 --> 01:07:02.737
MARISHA: Good final question! Thank you guys so
much.

01:07:02.737 --> 01:07:03.860
(applause)

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.266
MATT: I know many of you didn't get your questions
answered-- Thank you. If you still have questions,

01:07:07.266 --> 01:07:11.111
we have other panels throughout the weekend. You
can search the schedule. They're mostly voice

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:15.124
over-related, but if you squeeze in a roleplaying
game question here and there, we won't argue.

01:07:15.134 --> 01:07:22.172
MARISHA: I have a Stunt Acting and Stunt Fighting
for the Camera panel tomorrow from 8:30-9:30, or

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:28.195
9:30-10:30, something like that. It's fun, and you
bring sweatpants and get active, because I teach

01:07:28.195 --> 01:07:31.932
you how to punch. Don't punch each other,
though...

01:07:31.932 --> 01:07:33.975
MATT: All right guys, thank you so much for
coming.

01:07:33.975 --> 01:07:41.030
MARISHA: The morning one at nine got canceled
because you guys aren't going to be up, don't lie.

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:45.013
I'm not going to be, either. So it's the later
one, do the later one, not the 9AM one, I won't be there.

01:07:45.013 --> 01:07:48.307
MATT: Thank you all so much. Have a wonderful
evening. We'll see you tomorrow.

01:07:48.307 --> 01:07:49.859
(cheering)

01:07:49.859 --> 01:08:21.621
