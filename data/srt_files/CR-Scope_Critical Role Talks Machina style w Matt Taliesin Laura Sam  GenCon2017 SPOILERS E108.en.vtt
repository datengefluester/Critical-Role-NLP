00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.291
[dramatic music]

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:29.395
[cheering]

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.966
BRIAN: That's all I got. How are you guys?

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:36.685
[cheering]

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:42.973
BRIAN: There's too many people. Don't come out
here. There's too many people! Okay. Where's Tary?

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.955
AUDIENCE: Over here!

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:46.723
BRIAN: Stand up! Look at this!

00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:54.052
[cheering]

00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:55.383
BRIAN: What's your name?

00:00:55.383 --> 00:00:55.943
SARA: Sara!

00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:56.520
BRIAN: Sara?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.383
SARA: Yeah!

00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:03.692
BRIAN: You're fucking awesome. Okay. We've got to
get started. Hold on, I've got to move my fanny

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:13.374
pack. Okay, rules for this panel. Really fast,
here we go. One question per person. Do not ask

00:01:13.374 --> 00:01:18.054
the full cast a question or we'll be here until
tomorrow.

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:19.322
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's okay!

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:34.452
BRIAN: They're really bad at answering in a timely
fashion, sort of like when a door is involved.

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:39.844
There may be some spoilers. Let me save you some
time. Don't ask any "What's going to happen?"

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:51.126
questions. Those tend to go unanswered as well.
Finally, if you ask Matt what time it is, you will

00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:54.843
find out just how Irish Liam O'Brien and I are.

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:59.043
[cheering]

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:04.564
BRIAN: Without further ado, I would like to
introduce the cast of Critical Role.

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:08.150
[cheering]

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.467
BRIAN: Travis Willingham!

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:14.324
[cheering]

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:16.631
BRIAN: Marisha Ray!

00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:20.803
[cheering]

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:22.833
BRIAN: Taliesin Jaffe!

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:26.758
[cheering]

00:02:26.758 --> 00:02:29.094
BRIAN: Sam Riegel!

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:36.273
[cheering]

00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:41.962
BRIAN: Liam O'Brien!

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:48.423
[cheering]

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:52.464
BRIAN: Laura Motherfucking Bailey!

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:58.145
[cheering]

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:03.425
BRIAN: Your dungeon master, my dungeon master, our
dungeon master, Matthew Mercer!

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:23.864
[cheering]

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:25.263
BRIAN: Yo, you people are hyped up!

00:03:25.263 --> 00:03:29.153
[cheering]

00:03:29.153 --> 00:03:31.992
BRIAN: All right. What does yours say?

00:03:31.992 --> 00:03:33.623
TRAVIS: Mine says, "Travis Willingham eats
dicks."

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.893
[laughter]

00:03:36.893 --> 00:03:38.046
SAM: I wrote that.

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:50.713
BRIAN: Oh yeah? That's a shock. Well, we are about
to do the third Critical Role live.

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:55.494
[cheering]

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:56.873
BRIAN: The second at Gen Con.

00:03:56.873 --> 00:03:57.844
TRAVIS: Genken.

00:04:02.404 --> 00:04:04.013
SAM: Laura doesn't have a mic, but that's okay.

00:04:04.013 --> 00:04:06.912
LAURA: No, we're figuring out how we're going to
share.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.304
TRAVIS: You're twins; you share shit already.

00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:23.313
BRIAN: How are you guys feeling about CRL 3? I
don't know what to call this. #criticalrolelive.

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:24.421
How are you guys feeling?

00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:25.173
TRAVIS: We're going to die!

00:04:25.173 --> 00:04:29.270
[laughter]

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.742
TALIESIN: I'm really glad if we go out, we can be
with an audience.

00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:37.164
MATT: I-- [inaudible] mic working?

00:04:37.164 --> 00:04:40.327
BRIAN: It better be.

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:42.203
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I can hear you and you're
beautiful!

00:04:42.203 --> 00:04:44.694
[laughter]

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:51.153
MATT: (yelling) I am excited for tonight's show!
You'll soon know why.

00:04:51.153 --> 00:05:02.027
BRIAN: Save your voice. You need it. We need it to
be beautiful and soft. Then immediately turn terrifying.

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:09.894
MARISHA: Am I allowed to say this? I don't know,
whatever. He kept saying how he was excited

00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:13.686
because he had a lot of rules questions to ask the
Wizards of the Coast people.

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:17.406
[laughter]

00:05:17.406 --> 00:05:20.917
MARISHA: I don't know what he's doing, but
something big is going on.

00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:27.336
LAURA: They're wrong anyways. We're not paying
attention down here. We're trying to figure out

00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:30.206
mic stuff. Whatever you were saying, Marisha.

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:35.057
MATT: We will share that mic.

00:05:35.057 --> 00:05:38.894
BRIAN: I don't even see-- Oh, there is a sound
booth up there.

00:05:38.894 --> 00:05:39.636
MATT: Shame!

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:46.258
[laughter]

00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:48.438
LIAM: We shared the womb!

00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:52.267
LAURA: That's right.

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:59.865
BRIAN: Hey, Matt. What is the biggest difference
for you in planning a Critical Role regular

00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:06.007
Thursday night stream session than doing a big
live thing like this, which is so terrifying, and

00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:11.044
I don't know how you're going to get through it
without so much Xanax and horse tranquilizers?

00:06:11.044 --> 00:06:18.111
MATT: You hit the nail on the head there. It's
more the nerves of knowing that there's a lot of

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:29.729
people watching live at home, and hearing a lot of
people watching it live right there. Having the

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.850
space, and having to finagle the stage to work so
that we're all still comfortable playing, and also

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.505
people can watch it. We've got some unique
challenges, but preparing for it, I am

00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:41.948
legitimately terrified.

00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:44.636
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! You're great!

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:46.399
BRIAN: How many of you are going tonight?

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:55.677
[cheering]

00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:56.457
SAM: That was amazing.

00:06:56.457 --> 00:07:02.516
BRIAN: That was a wave that didn't even mean to
happen. It turned into a wave.

00:07:02.516 --> 00:07:04.736
MARISHA: I love Gen Con.

00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:08.957
SAM: I feel bad for the three people who aren't
going.

00:07:08.957 --> 00:07:11.776
[laughter]

00:07:11.776 --> 00:07:14.768
SAM: Who doesn't have tickets? We love you guys.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:19.646
LAURA: This is the real live show.

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:22.106
[laughter]

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:23.396
MARISHA: It blinds you.

00:07:23.396 --> 00:07:26.909
BRIAN: This is not the real live show because it
started on time.

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:37.667
[laughter]

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:42.778
BRIAN: Oh shit, we have more to talk about. Okay.
I'm having so much fun and I'm seeing so many

00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:50.503
people that I recognize, and many that I don't,
and I'm glad I don't. Why don't you guys start

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:55.822
lining up for questions in an orderly fashion,
please? Be respectful of some of the beautiful cosplay.

00:07:55.822 --> 00:07:56.592
TRAVIS: Watch your wings.

00:07:56.592 --> 00:07:57.660
BRIAN: Watch your wings.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:13.601
[inaudible]

00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:18.193
LIAM: Before we start the questions, could
everyone who is wearing cosplay right now stand up

00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:19.080
so we can see you?

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.722
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, we can!

00:08:19.722 --> 00:08:23.094
[cheering]

00:08:23.094 --> 00:08:24.093
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, Matt!

00:08:24.093 --> 00:08:31.303
[cheering]

00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:32.442
BRIAN: Vox Moochina!

00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:48.947
[laughter, cheering]

00:08:48.947 --> 00:08:59.437
[crowd noise]

00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:00.929
SAM: It's so beautiful!

00:09:05.489 --> 00:09:12.808
BRIAN: This is a lot to take in. While you guys
are lining up, Sam, what are some of the things--

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:22.157
to get people teased for the show tonight, maybe
to whet their appetite, as they say.

00:09:22.157 --> 00:09:22.858
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Get naked!

00:09:22.858 --> 00:09:31.689
[laughter, wolf whistles]

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:37.409
BRIAN: You got five bucks, I'll do it. Sam, what
are some of the things that we can expect in

00:09:37.624 --> 00:09:39.337
Critical Role Live 3 tonight?

00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:45.464
SAM: In the Critical Role Live show tonight, you
can expect to see accidental second base between

00:09:45.464 --> 00:09:46.843
Scanlan and Vax.

00:09:46.843 --> 00:09:53.831
BRIAN: You don't want to end up accidentally
getting to second base.

00:09:53.831 --> 00:10:00.892
SAM: You will see Cirque du Soleil-style
trampoline stunts. You will see technical

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:12.993
difficulties. You will see a Marisha inspirational
leader speech about Macklemore's best song. Any

00:10:12.993 --> 00:10:14.582
other teases, Brian?

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:19.492
BRIAN: If anything goes wrong technically, you can
turn around and literally watch the entire crew

00:10:19.492 --> 00:10:28.444
yell at you, "We know!" Tonight, you will see the
Twitch chat be pissed off that all of these

00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:30.194
beautiful people will be in the room.

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:35.574
[cheering]

00:10:35.574 --> 00:10:40.381
BRIAN: Marisha. You got a pretty epic
How-da-der-da-der-dis.

00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:41.139
MARISHA: Oh man.

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:45.142
BRIAN: Last year at Gen Con. How does that feel?

00:10:45.142 --> 00:10:51.205
MARISHA: It's still legit probably one of the top
three moments of my lifetime, because hearing

00:10:51.205 --> 00:10:59.723
everyone immediately erupt hit me like a fucking
nuclear bomb. I think I went like this-- and it

00:10:59.723 --> 00:11:03.212
was legitimate, amazing. Incredible. Shockwave.

00:11:03.212 --> 00:11:07.026
BRIAN: Well [inaudible].

00:11:07.026 --> 00:11:08.213
LAURA: We're not going to fight at all tonight.

00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:10.254
AUDIENCE: Shopping!

00:11:10.254 --> 00:11:13.843
TRAVIS: Fuck shopping!

00:11:13.843 --> 00:11:22.414
[laughter]

00:11:22.414 --> 00:11:25.524
BRIAN: There's so much anger behind it. That's
what I like, man, that it's legitimate hate.

00:11:25.524 --> 00:11:27.486
TRAVIS: We didn't fly to Indianapolis to shop!

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:31.683
[laughter]

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:35.754
LIAM: Why don't we all turn on one of the cast and
kill them to give somebody that rush? I'm a good

00:11:35.754 --> 00:11:37.962
candidate, I'll--

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.654
TRAVIS: You're already dead.

00:11:39.654 --> 00:11:46.972
BRIAN: Liam, you weren't able to be here last
year, very sadly and under sad circumstances. We

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:56.542
are so glad that you are this year. I didn't
really have anything planned to say about that. I

00:11:56.542 --> 00:11:58.443
just wanted to say that I'm glad you're here this
year.

00:11:58.443 --> 00:11:59.892
LIAM: Thank you.

00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:06.203
BRIAN: She's not coming. Yeah, Ashley's not
coming. I was hoping it would be a surprise, but

00:12:06.203 --> 00:12:08.154
she is working very, very long hours.

00:12:08.154 --> 00:12:12.050
LIAM: It was real hard to be on the outside last
year, so we are thinking about our cleric.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.853
TRAVIS: Yeah! Ashley Johnson!

00:12:13.853 --> 00:12:21.688
MATT: If you want to get the hashtag
#releaseourashley going.

00:12:21.688 --> 00:12:26.534
[laughter]

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:28.712
BRIAN: Yeah, tweet at NBC Blindside. No! Don't!

00:12:28.712 --> 00:12:31.693
LAURA: Pretty sure we'll get her fired.

00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:43.838
BRIAN: That's okay, there other jobs. Near all of
us. Okay, who's up first? Please state your name

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:45.747
so that we can say hi to you too.

00:12:45.747 --> 00:12:47.216
AMBER: Hello, my name is Amber.

00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:50.857
BRIAN: You look so good.

00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:56.798
AMBER: My question is between Liam and Matt.
You're both Lord of the Rings fans. Who would be

00:12:56.798 --> 00:12:58.697
the better Sméagol? Who would be the better
Gollum?

00:12:58.697 --> 00:13:05.278
BRIAN: Starting off with an epic question! Gen Con
is bringing it.

00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:08.967
MATT: You're easily the better Gollum.

00:13:08.967 --> 00:13:12.447
LIAM: I mean, darkness and light.

00:13:12.447 --> 00:13:22.958
LAURA: I know. I feel like you're Sméagol, you're
Gollum.

00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:27.218
[laughter]

00:13:27.218 --> 00:13:29.427
MATT: By the way, you only have 36 more minutes
with those wings.

00:13:29.427 --> 00:13:37.558
[laughter]

00:13:37.558 --> 00:13:40.296
BRIAN: And you've got how many bonus actions left?
Oh okay, if you guys didn't hear what Matt said,

00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:42.697
he said, "You only have 36 more minutes in those
wings."

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:43.609
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We heard!

00:13:43.609 --> 00:13:47.403
BRIAN: Okay, sorry, didn't realize he had the mic
fixed. She was all mad. She's like, "We heard!"

00:13:47.403 --> 00:13:50.398
MARISHA: You look awesome.

00:13:50.398 --> 00:13:51.486
KATIE: Thank you.

00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:52.509
BRIAN: What's your name?

00:13:52.509 --> 00:14:02.258
KATIE: My name is Katie. I actually have my twin
that I'm with. My question is for Liam. Vax's

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:06.990
relationship with the Raven Queen at the
beginning, it was more like he had to fulfill his

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:13.886
obligation [inaudible]. Has that changed recently?
Especially with the things you do with the Raven Queen.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.999
LIAM: I only caught the tail end of that.

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:19.537
BRIAN: Yeah, we might need that, a little bit more
volume. Or if you have fills, you can throw that

00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:20.538
mic in for me.

00:14:20.538 --> 00:14:23.019
SAM: Deep down, has your relationship changed with
the Raven Queen?

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:30.437
LIAM: Yeah. It was making a deal with a gangster,
as far as he knew in the beginning. He didn't know

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:35.529
shit about her. He never cared about gods and
didn't trust magic, didn't trust religion. Didn't

00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:43.403
know anything about religion. Now, he's faithful,
now. He'll probably always be a little weirded out

00:14:43.614 --> 00:14:51.977
by it, but I think he has the feeling of kinship
with her now. But he doesn't talk about it.

00:14:51.977 --> 00:14:57.572
MATT: I think the rest of that question was, how
do you feel-- no, not yet. How do you feel the

00:14:57.572 --> 00:15:02.614
dynamic's changed based on the original choice was
to-- Anyway.

00:15:02.614 --> 00:15:09.053
[cheering]

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.516
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We can see your ankles!

00:15:19.516 --> 00:15:25.843
[laughter]

00:15:25.843 --> 00:15:33.909
BRIAN: They have probably never seen your ankles
or feet. You might have Shaquille O'Neal-sized feet.

00:15:34.238 --> 00:15:40.358
MATT: As far as the original deal was made to save
Vax's life.

00:15:40.358 --> 00:15:41.906
LIAM: My sister is Vex.

00:15:41.906 --> 00:15:46.230
BRIAN: Is CritRoleStats in the room?

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.558
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:15:47.558 --> 00:15:49.250
BRIAN: Ah! Write it down!

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.418
[cheering]

00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:54.614
BRIAN: CritRoleStats, by the way.

00:15:54.614 --> 00:15:56.498
MATT: There are only two people responsible for
that confusion.

00:15:56.498 --> 00:16:04.008
[cheering]

00:16:04.008 --> 00:16:09.537
BRIAN: As I said on Talks Tuesday night, Matt and
I, we had to have a talk because, no pun intended,

00:16:09.537 --> 00:16:17.628
but no characters with one letter off names the
next campaign. Can we set a rule so this doesn't

00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:18.209
happen again?

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:20.038
MATT: They can do it. They're just going to die in
the first session.

00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:27.106
BRIAN: Yeah, exactly. Andrew hasn't seen his wife
in six months. He's been counting the number of

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:28.566
times we fucked up your name.

00:16:28.566 --> 00:16:31.567
MARISHA: Is it the same with 14 syllable names?
Percy.

00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:35.427
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm bringing it way down. My next
one's easy.

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:41.537
BRIAN: You're going to be Bob. Okay, next
question. Thank you so much.

00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:43.947
MARISHA: Hey, come here. Keyleth. Catch!

00:16:43.947 --> 00:16:48.848
BRIAN: Oh yeah. If you ask a question, we have
pins. Who has them? Who in my gang has them? Oh!

00:16:48.848 --> 00:16:57.546
Rachel, right here. Get a pin from Rachel, after
you ask a question. We have "Thanks, Keyleth," we

00:16:57.546 --> 00:17:02.090
have some made specially for us by a Critter. Yes.
If you see us around later, we also have some.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:07.765
LIAM: Also, is the one Critter in the audience who
I am carrying a pin for here? Right now? He'll

00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:11.373
know what I'm talking about. They're not. Okay.
Next question!

00:17:11.734 --> 00:17:20.122
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is for Laura. Because
you use a lot of dice, sent to you by fans, do you

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:23.672
ever worry that the dice are unbalanced or even
loaded?

00:17:23.672 --> 00:17:26.773
LAURA: I don't really care.

00:17:26.773 --> 00:17:30.893
[laughter]

00:17:30.893 --> 00:17:38.403
LAURA: I roll them so little, each one, really.
It's an average of, like, 300 dice a game.

00:17:38.403 --> 00:17:43.522
TRAVIS: Guys, we got to the airport and TSA was
like, "Ma'am, only two carry on items."

00:17:43.522 --> 00:17:47.711
BRIAN: One of them cannot be--

00:17:47.711 --> 00:17:50.242
TRAVIS: A small child can not come with you.

00:17:50.242 --> 00:17:55.813
LAURA: Travis didn't realize I brought my whole
giant ass bag of dice. I didn't bring my dice tray

00:17:55.813 --> 00:17:57.819
because I wanted to bring my dice bag instead.

00:17:57.819 --> 00:18:04.091
BRIAN: Oh my gosh, it's a serious problem. Hey.
What's your name?

00:18:04.091 --> 00:18:11.703
JESSICA: I'm Jessica, AKA ShandraVdeG. I'm one of
the admins for the Critical Role Facebook group.

00:18:11.703 --> 00:18:15.153
I wanted to let you guys know that last night we
hit 25,000 members.

00:18:15.153 --> 00:18:20.172
[cheering]

00:18:20.172 --> 00:18:22.903
BRIAN: Give the URL. What's the URL for it, in
case these people haven't found it yet?

00:18:22.903 --> 00:18:26.382
JESSICA: facebook.com/groups/criticalrolefanclub.

00:18:26.382 --> 00:18:27.951
BRIAN: Awesome. How many?

00:18:27.951 --> 00:18:30.153
JESSICA: 25,000.

00:18:30.153 --> 00:18:31.942
BRIAN: Thank you, guys.

00:18:31.942 --> 00:18:36.684
JESSICA: This is for anyone who wants to answer
it. Outside of the show, what is the best thing

00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:41.212
that has happened because of the show? Whoever
wants to take it.

00:18:41.212 --> 00:18:46.312
[cheering]

00:18:46.312 --> 00:18:51.384
MATT: You guys. I mean, the community you guys
have built around this. Our show, in my opinion,

00:18:51.384 --> 00:18:57.654
has taken a backseat to the good that you guys put
out there amongst yourselves and other people. I'm

00:18:57.654 --> 00:19:02.114
always happy to be a small little sparking point
for that. It's gotten so much larger than anything

00:19:02.114 --> 00:19:04.814
we do now. That's really incredible, I think.

00:19:04.814 --> 00:19:09.432
LIAM: Can we get a show of hands? How many people
in this room started playing Dungeons & Dragons

00:19:09.432 --> 00:19:13.899
after having watched Critical Role? There you go.
There is your answer right there.

00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:20.989
[applause]

00:19:20.989 --> 00:19:22.793
BRIAN: Wow, thank you. Thank you so much.

00:19:22.793 --> 00:19:33.735
REY: Hi! I'm Rey from [inaudible] last night. I'm
here [inaudible].

00:19:33.735 --> 00:19:40.594
BRIAN: Oh man, that guy was also drunk last night.
GenCon, baby. Go ahead.

00:19:40.594 --> 00:19:47.705
REY: My question is for Matt. I really want to
know, why did Jarett get kicked out of Marquet?

00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:57.413
MATT: The game's not over yet. That's a good
question, but I don't know what's going to happen.

00:19:57.413 --> 00:20:01.263
If that ever comes up in the story line, I don't
want to spoil it here. When the campaign's over, I

00:20:01.263 --> 00:20:10.493
do want to do a retrospective Q&A. A lot of
[inaudible] campaign were started and never came

00:20:10.493 --> 00:20:14.822
to fruition, as you all know happens a lot in role
playing games. We can talk about things that

00:20:14.822 --> 00:20:20.081
aren't going to impact necessarily the next
campaign. You can ask those questions and I can

00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:21.373
go, "I can tell you now!"

00:20:21.373 --> 00:20:27.251
BRIAN: Yeah, we're going to do a full cast plus
Matt retrospective on the campaign after. Probably

00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:38.114
like a very extended Talks episode. Or something
like [inaudible] talk for Critical Role, yeah.

00:20:38.114 --> 00:20:41.473
LAURA: Yeah, but some of the things that you still
won't be able to answer because we'll still be in

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:42.173
the same world.

00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:48.384
MATT: Yeah. [inaudible]

00:20:48.384 --> 00:20:50.196
LAURA: Jarett got kicked out for being too damn
fine.

00:20:50.196 --> 00:20:53.721
MATT: I said not to spoil it.

00:20:53.721 --> 00:20:58.192
BRIAN: Okay. Who's next? Thank you.

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:01.331
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I am meepsandsheeps.

00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.064
BRIAN: Oh nice.

00:21:02.064 --> 00:21:05.752
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My husband is [inaudible].

00:21:05.752 --> 00:21:11.174
BRIAN: Oh yeah, he always asks really great
questions. Tell him I say "Hey" and "Stay turnt."

00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:17.563
Oh that's you? What's up, dude? How are you? Come
get a pin from Rachel. Be careful though, she can

00:21:17.563 --> 00:21:21.123
be mean. What's your question?

00:21:21.123 --> 00:21:28.599
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, my question is for Matt. If
you were to have an NPC of a flumph, what would

00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:30.013
said flumph sound like?

00:21:30.013 --> 00:21:42.075
MATT: Oh man. That's going to be a messy one. I
think it's going to sound something like--

00:21:42.075 --> 00:21:45.546
SAM: "Oh hello. It's nice to meet you."

00:21:45.546 --> 00:21:47.224
MATT: Marisha's dwarf?

00:21:47.224 --> 00:21:48.883
LAURA: So he's celestial?

00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:59.314
MATT: I'd imagine it would be something like, "Hi,
I want to come with you guys." They seem like the

00:21:59.314 --> 00:22:05.303
DnD; blobfish. Just this wonderful, flat creature.
If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't

00:22:05.303 --> 00:22:07.864
know what a flumph is, look it up. Oh yeah, that
sounds like a flumph.

00:22:07.864 --> 00:22:14.413
LIAM: It's like the inside of an oyster, much
bigger and floating on a [inaudible].

00:22:14.413 --> 00:22:19.521
MATT: (flumph noises) Thank you for that.

00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:23.016
BRIAN: Sounds like Laura when she's hungry.

00:22:23.016 --> 00:22:34.006
[laughter]

00:22:34.006 --> 00:22:40.036
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I want to thank Matt for the
retweet last night, for the Larkin sign. My phone

00:22:40.036 --> 00:22:44.596
died pretty much from all the Twitter
notifications. For whoever wants to jump in first,

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:50.596
new campaign means new characters. Is anyone going
to try to top the majesty that is cock lightning

00:22:50.596 --> 00:22:51.553
for an intro?

00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:56.273
[laughter]

00:22:56.278 --> 00:23:00.904
BRIAN: We're going to have to have someone with
machine gun boobs that shoot lightning.

00:23:00.904 --> 00:23:09.595
SAM: The next intro should be all of us doing
various forms of cock lightning. Just come walking

00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:13.127
out of a room (explosion sound).

00:23:13.127 --> 00:23:16.566
TALIESIN: In a circle, and the lightning rises in
the middle.

00:23:16.566 --> 00:23:21.025
SAM: [inaudible] cross the streams.

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:26.043
MATT: Most awkward episode of Captain Planet
ever.

00:23:26.043 --> 00:23:29.696
TRAVIS: All our hands are up like a roller
coaster.

00:23:29.696 --> 00:23:35.527
LIAM: That's how they sealed up the Chained
Oblivion.

00:23:35.527 --> 00:23:45.396
BRIAN: Oh my god, we have only been here for 23
minutes and my stomach hurts from laughing. You

00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:47.201
guys are amazing. What's your name?

00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:57.095
CJ: Hi, my name is CJ. [inaudible] on twitter. My
question is for Taliesin. Sorry, I'm a little

00:23:57.095 --> 00:24:08.877
nervous. With Vex'ahlia getting more interested
with Pelor and Percy's experience with Ioun, and

00:24:08.877 --> 00:24:18.237
this overall Vecna arc, is he possibly going to be
more interested in deities, overall?

00:24:18.237 --> 00:24:28.280
TALIESIN: No! I'll say he's come to terms with his
place and what that will actually mean may come

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:35.086
out in the next few episodes or not. He's
definitely not seeking the approval, really. He

00:24:35.086 --> 00:24:40.327
definitely figured out that there is something
that he does have admiration for while he's mildly

00:24:40.327 --> 00:24:48.456
irritated, but he's not that mad it didn't love
him back. No. He walked out of there going, "Well,

00:24:48.456 --> 00:24:49.386
"that's just fine."

00:24:49.386 --> 00:24:56.640
[laughter]

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.117
TALIESIN: If it had been anybody other than
Scanlan, but because it was Scanlan, he was like,

00:24:59.117 --> 00:25:04.356
"I don't care. Fine. This is so dumb."

00:25:04.356 --> 00:25:08.945
MARISHA: This end of the table is Team
Non-Exalted.

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:09.466
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:14.998
[cheering]

00:25:14.998 --> 00:25:17.228
BRIAN: [inaudible]

00:25:17.228 --> 00:25:22.911
TALIESIN: He doesn't have animosity towards it,
but it's definitely not his thing. He's figured

00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:26.298
out that he's just not cut out for it. Good
question, though.

00:25:26.298 --> 00:25:27.025
CJ: Thank you.

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:29.232
BRIAN: Thank you. Hey, what's your name?

00:25:30.802 --> 00:25:37.513
WILL: My name is Will. This is a forward-looking
question. One thing we have seen in the world of

00:25:37.513 --> 00:25:44.134
Exandria is the development both magical
[inaudible] and airships, but also

00:25:44.134 --> 00:25:49.564
technology-technology. My question is once the
current campaign ends tonight in a TPK.

00:25:49.584 --> 00:26:03.674
[laughter]

00:26:03.674 --> 00:26:09.924
WILL: When the new campaign begins after the timeskip,
how do you see those trends continuing to develop? If you

00:26:09.924 --> 00:26:14.634
have time for an in-character question, I wanted
to ask some of the-- technologically minded

00:26:14.634 --> 00:26:24.622
characters to talk about what inspires
them to do what they do, Taliesin's Percy, Sam's

00:26:24.622 --> 00:26:29.264
Tary, and Matt's NPCs like Dr. Ripley and Victor.

00:26:29.264 --> 00:26:30.044
MATT: Right.

00:26:30.044 --> 00:26:33.634
LIAM: Okay, everyone have a seat for the radio
play that will be the rest of the panel.

00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:37.838
BRIAN: Yeah, we might need to sell tickets for
that question.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.219
MATT: Yeah, that's actually a great question, and
could be a much longer discussion. I'll try to

00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:48.527
keep it precise. Much like, for instance,
oil-based gasolines, fossil fuels, we have

00:26:48.527 --> 00:26:53.700
technology that far exceeds what [inaudible]
Whoever controls the technology can control the

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.703
rate at which it expands and is used. I think it's
a very similar circumstance that people who can

00:26:57.703 --> 00:27:02.816
create high-end magic technology also very
strongly control the use of it to the best of

00:27:02.816 --> 00:27:07.947
their benefit, both monetarily and for political
power. That is very much how I see that it is

00:27:07.947 --> 00:27:12.566
controlled through Exandria. I don't see
necessarily a perpetual kind of coming singularity,

00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:17.818
if you will, of magical technology in Exandria to
where it would rapidly change in the next

00:27:17.818 --> 00:27:22.580
campaign. You may see elements of it used more
often. As far as more mundane technology, that's

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.809
going to be interesting because that is a threat
in the hands of the common man, being able to do

00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:33.089
what a mage could possibly do with years of
training. Then you have this at-odds circumstance

00:27:33.089 --> 00:27:38.451
of technology that empowers the little man versus
those that should be in power, from their mindset,

00:27:38.451 --> 00:27:40.864
so I'm curious to see where that goes.

00:27:43.414 --> 00:27:56.418
SAM: In character. (as Tary) Doty, take this down.
I have an idea for a hat that holds two bottles of

00:27:56.607 --> 00:28:08.978
aerated wine with a tube into my mouth so that I
could always be lubricated. Also, put this down

00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:13.108
just as a note. A 56k baud dial-up modem.

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:19.988
[laughter]

00:28:19.988 --> 00:28:24.228
TALIESIN: Sadly, Percy's answer would actually be
a spoiler at this point. I'm going to have to hold

00:28:24.427 --> 00:28:29.591
that. If I die, we'll have a conversation about
it, but if I don't die then I'll save it.

00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:34.273
LIAM: Oh, okay. Follow up question. Does Scanlan
worry about the mass weaponization of cock

00:28:34.273 --> 00:28:39.954
lightning and it being in the wrong hands across
the world?

00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:41.550
MATT: I think it's called the baby arms race.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:55.769
[applause]

00:28:55.769 --> 00:28:57.059
BRIAN: That's Tal'dorable.

00:28:57.059 --> 00:29:05.308
[groans, laughter]

00:29:05.308 --> 00:29:10.290
ERIC: My name's Eric. Matt--

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:16.710
BRIAN: What boots are these? Don't get kicked by
this guy, he's got spikes on them.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:24.381
ERIC: Matt, your show is the best. You are such a
wonderful storyteller. "There Will be Brawl" is

00:29:24.381 --> 00:29:25.801
amazing, when is there going to be a sequel?

00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:31.000
[laughter]

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.478
MATT: Oh man, for those that haven't seen "There
Will be Brawl," it's a webseries that I directed

00:29:34.478 --> 00:29:36.701
and co-created back in 2008 or 2009.

00:29:36.701 --> 00:29:37.696
BRIAN: It's on YouTube.

00:29:37.696 --> 00:29:43.973
MATT: On YouTube. Super low budget, it's a live
action film noir, HBO crime drama version of

00:29:43.973 --> 00:29:45.964
Nintendo's Smash Brothers universe.

00:29:45.964 --> 00:29:50.261
ERIC: It's every bit as ridiculous as it sounds
and it's wonderful.

00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:53.098
MATT: Well, thank you. I was really proud of it.
It took itself super seriously and that's what was

00:29:53.098 --> 00:29:57.497
wonderful about it. Donning costumes and
prosthetics, I played Ganondorf in it. Anyway,

00:29:57.497 --> 00:30:00.461
that process almost killed me.

00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:03.134
ERIC: Because you don't have enough free time as
it is.

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:11.283
MATT: Exactly. A sequel, oh man. We'll say if
somehow a crazy windfall were to hit and the rest

00:30:11.283 --> 00:30:15.059
of the industry burned down, and I'm like, "I got
nothing else better to do," then yeah, maybe a

00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:23.872
sequel. Right now, I'm a little busy. We had plans
for a sequel, but it never quite came to fruition.

00:30:23.872 --> 00:30:29.262
We had a prequel too, with the actual Kirby
murders, because Kirby in our universe is a

00:30:29.262 --> 00:30:36.454
cannibalistic killer. He wants to eat people and
wear their skin! Hats. When he eats Sonic, where

00:30:36.454 --> 00:30:41.058
does that come from? That's his scalp. Good
question!

00:30:41.058 --> 00:30:43.173
ERIC: What's your favorite 16-bit RPG?

00:30:43.173 --> 00:30:50.433
BRIAN: No second questions. Plus, that was too
close to the one at Comic Con. They asked 8-bit,

00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:52.665
16-bit JRPG at Comic Con. Right?

00:30:52.665 --> 00:30:53.592
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:53.592 --> 00:30:58.864
BRIAN: We all got shit for answers. Hello, what's
your name?

00:30:58.864 --> 00:31:01.943
RASHEEK: Hello, my name is Rasheek, I'm from Czech
Republic.

00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:08.844
BRIAN: You came all the way out here? Awesome.
Here, you get Travis's name tag.

00:31:08.844 --> 00:31:19.794
[cheers, applause]

00:31:19.794 --> 00:31:27.452
RASHEEK: My question is for Travis. I have some
Czech beer. Do you want some?

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:28.022
SAM: Yes!

00:31:28.862 --> 00:31:31.272
RASHEEK: Czech beer.

00:31:31.292 --> 00:31:33.254
TRAVIS: Man, <i>fuck</i> yes!

00:31:33.254 --> 00:31:57.028
[laughter, cheering]

00:31:57.028 --> 00:32:00.818
TRAVIS: It's just Kool Aid and pilsner.

00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:03.157
BRIAN: Thank you so much.

00:32:03.157 --> 00:32:06.364
SAM: That is the best question we have ever been
asked.

00:32:06.364 --> 00:32:07.364
BRIAN: Thank you so much.

00:32:12.784 --> 00:32:16.647
BRIAN: What is your name? Look at that outfit. How
long did that take to put together?

00:32:16.647 --> 00:32:17.654
ASHLEY: I don't know.

00:32:17.654 --> 00:32:20.886
BRIAN: Okay, what's your name?

00:32:20.886 --> 00:32:21.786
ASHLEY: I'm Ashley.

00:32:21.786 --> 00:32:26.767
BRIAN: That's a beautiful name. Just tilt it down.

00:32:27.352 --> 00:32:28.654
ASHLEY: I can't.

00:32:28.654 --> 00:32:38.558
ASHLEY: I'm Ashley, I'm the Raven Queen. My
question is for Matt. I was wondering: when the

00:32:38.558 --> 00:32:44.787
Raven Queen was ascending to godhood, was it her
intention to be the goddess of death and replace

00:32:44.787 --> 00:32:47.690
the old god or was that an accident?

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:55.105
MATT: I will say that what the myth and lore that
currently exists of the Age of Arcana speaks, many

00:32:55.105 --> 00:33:08.222
of the poems and stories say it was intentional.
Out of eventual distrust and disapproval of the

00:33:08.222 --> 00:33:15.359
god who at the time held the portfolios. Whereas
previously, the individual whose name has been

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:21.711
scrubbed from history who held that office, if you
will, the portfolios, was destroyed because she

00:33:22.711 --> 00:33:24.520
felt that she could do a much better job.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:31.760
[applause]

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.559
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have two things if you will
indulge me for a moment.

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:37.789
BRIAN and TRAVIS: Maybe.

00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:41.750
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey crowd. You want to join me on
this magic carpet ride? On the count of three, if

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:49.561
we could all say, "Fuck you, Brian Foster." One,
two, three.

00:33:49.561 --> 00:33:52.810
AUDIENCE: Fuck you, Brian Foster!

00:33:52.810 --> 00:34:05.743
BRIAN: Can we do one more for my Instagram? I
don't want to make this all about me. One, two, three.

00:34:05.995 --> 00:34:08.948
AUDIENCE: Fuck you, Brian Foster!

00:34:08.948 --> 00:34:17.467
BRIAN: My mom will love that. Okay, I can indulge
another one then.

00:34:17.467 --> 00:34:40.216
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt and Marisha, congratulations
again. Question! Taliesin, you have said before

00:34:40.216 --> 00:34:44.165
that Percy is a few bad decisions away becoming a
villain.

00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:44.578
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:34:44.578 --> 00:34:50.505
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Now after the Vecna fight, if
Vex'ahlia were to die, because--

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:52.476
LAURA: How dare you.

00:34:52.476 --> 00:34:58.587
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Delilah has something for
Vex'ahlia. For some reason, that Finger of Death

00:34:58.587 --> 00:35:06.513
has always targeted you. For some reason-- I don't
know why. Should she die, will that be the last

00:35:06.513 --> 00:35:13.313
straw or the last tipping point for Percy? That
might make him go crazy? Because he is a mad scientist.

00:35:14.263 --> 00:35:24.579
TALIESIN: There is naturally an answer to that,
and I am not answering it here. [inaudible] I have

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:25.995
thought about that, there is an answer to that.

00:35:25.995 --> 00:35:32.454
BRIAN: Thank you so much. You're really funny.
Hey, what's your name? I wasn't saying that

00:35:32.454 --> 00:35:33.664
sarcastically, either.

00:35:36.184 --> 00:35:42.092
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible] I wanted to say thank
you, I'm sure I speak for everyone, for everything

00:35:42.092 --> 00:35:47.927
that you have done Matt, and everyone on the cast.
I appreciate it, by [inaudible]. I drove 14 hours

00:35:47.927 --> 00:35:49.117
to come here.

00:35:49.117 --> 00:35:50.924
BRIAN: No way! Where from?

00:35:51.473 --> 00:35:52.734
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Boston.

00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:54.043
BRIAN: Shout-out to Boston.

00:35:54.043 --> 00:35:55.094
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Go Patriots.

00:35:59.584 --> 00:36:01.994
BRIAN: Anyway, you can ask your related question.

00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:07.247
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You guys are probably going to
say no because I missed the signing thing and I

00:36:07.247 --> 00:36:09.832
have the [inaudible] poster with me.

00:36:09.832 --> 00:36:17.372
BRIAN: Yeah, the only reason that I am going to be
the bad cop here, only because we get thousands of

00:36:17.372 --> 00:36:23.442
tweets every time we do a con, from somebody
that's like, "My grandmother fell when the tickets

00:36:23.442 --> 00:36:29.921
"were on sale and her Life Alert, the battery was
dead--" and we just can't, unfortunately, we can't

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:30.502
do [inaudible]

00:36:30.502 --> 00:36:31.682
LAURA: It's very specific.

00:36:31.682 --> 00:36:39.262
BRIAN: Yeah, but if you give me $150, I will no--
I'm sorry. Did you have a question, though?

00:36:39.262 --> 00:36:45.514
MATT: If you see any of us wandering the hall,
very discreetly nudge our shoulder and say, "Need

00:36:45.514 --> 00:36:49.141
"you to sign this, hoping to get out of the middle
of this crowd here." And we'll try to do that.

00:36:49.483 --> 00:36:54.283
BRIAN: Yeah, that's actually a really good tip,
Matt. If you see somebody and you want to say hi

00:36:54.283 --> 00:36:59.533
or whatever, just be really quiet. "Hey, can you
sign this?" Because if you are like, (high-pitched

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:05.243
scream) "Oh my god, it's Matthew Mercer!" You have
a thousand girls with a McCree body pillow come out.

00:37:05.243 --> 00:37:14.663
[laughter, applause]

00:37:14.663 --> 00:37:16.032
MATT: (as McCree) He is not kidding.

00:37:16.032 --> 00:37:23.946
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question kind of ties into the
last question. Taliesin: would that, or something,

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:26.681
push you to make you use that contract?

00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:32.927
TALIESIN: I am aware that the contract exists.
I've read it.

00:37:32.927 --> 00:37:41.302
MARISHA: You creep me out sometimes. You freak me
out. Because every once in a while you're like

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:48.053
Frodo with the ring. Every once in a while, you
pull it out and you just stare at it [inaudible].

00:37:48.053 --> 00:37:56.124
I swear to god, all the time, you'll be like
[inaudible]

00:37:56.124 --> 00:38:01.371
LIAM: If you make it to the end of this campaign
and resist pulling that trigger, I will be impressed.

00:38:01.371 --> 00:38:01.783
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:38:01.783 --> 00:38:04.402
LIAM: [inaudible]

00:38:04.402 --> 00:38:07.462
TALIESIN: I'll be impressed make it to the end of
the game without pulling it.

00:38:07.462 --> 00:38:09.442
LIAM: Any week now, any week.

00:38:09.442 --> 00:38:11.193
LAURA: We have another Raven Queen.

00:38:11.193 --> 00:38:12.463
BRIAN: Yes, what's your name?

00:38:12.463 --> 00:38:18.214
BRITTANY: I'm Brittany. I actually only drove like
20 minutes to be here.

00:38:18.214 --> 00:38:22.904
[laughter]

00:38:22.904 --> 00:38:25.415
TRAVIS: Shout-out 20 minutes!

00:38:25.415 --> 00:38:33.722
BRITTANY: Actually, I have something from the
Raven Queen for her paladin, as well as something

00:38:33.722 --> 00:38:39.578
for the rest of you guys. I apologize, I am hoping
they're good luck charms. I have a skull for each

00:38:39.578 --> 00:38:40.053
of you.

00:38:40.053 --> 00:38:43.524
LAURA: A skull? You're going to give us a skull?

00:38:48.274 --> 00:38:56.648
BRITTANY: My question is for Marisha. I don't play
too many druids, but I love them because they are

00:38:56.879 --> 00:39:03.878
badass in general. What is your favorite spell and
what's a spell you wish you had that you don't have?

00:39:03.878 --> 00:39:15.039
MARISHA: Oh! Oh. I mean, I am a little partial to
Feeblemind. That's pretty great. Call Lightning is

00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:22.143
a go-to classic Keyleth favorite. I wish I had
Counterspell.

00:39:22.143 --> 00:39:26.143
MARISHA: [inaudible]

00:39:26.143 --> 00:39:28.753
MATT: That spell is bullshit.

00:39:28.753 --> 00:39:32.113
[laughter, cheering]

00:39:32.113 --> 00:39:33.943
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Vecna used it!

00:39:37.952 --> 00:39:39.236
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

00:39:39.236 --> 00:39:48.476
KAT: Thank you, there is only 15,000 of us in
here. My name is Kat. My question is for Marisha

00:39:48.476 --> 00:39:53.563
and Taliesin. Will the Whitestone industrial
revolution be environmentalist?

00:39:56.603 --> 00:39:58.453
TALIESIN: Actually, yes.

00:39:58.453 --> 00:40:01.292
MARISHA: We have the stocks.

00:40:01.292 --> 00:40:08.938
TALIESIN: We have the stocks. No, I think that a
lot of-- just to make it a little quicker than the

00:40:09.112 --> 00:40:14.130
way I discussed it a bit with Matt-- a lot of how
technology evolves is usually due to either

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:19.090
warfare or desperate need. When you have magic in
play, there are a lot of things that you just

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:25.248
don't need, so you don't really build it. I think
a lot of it is going to be trying to find cheap,

00:40:25.248 --> 00:40:31.288
easy ways of doing things without magic that are
not complicated and not natural. Which is why we

00:40:31.288 --> 00:40:36.159
are doing the steam-powered heating that we are
putting in Whitestone. It's quite useful.

00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:43.529
MARISHA: Yeah, he has a plan for steam-heated
roads so that the snow will melt and not clog up

00:40:43.529 --> 00:40:47.307
the roads, which is great.

00:40:47.307 --> 00:40:53.406
KAT: You don't have to answer, but can Percy make
anything nice and uncomplicated?

00:40:53.406 --> 00:40:53.859
TALIESIN: What?

00:40:53.859 --> 00:40:55.607
BRIAN: Can you make anything nice and complicated?

00:40:55.884 --> 00:40:57.155
KAT: Uncomplicated.

00:40:57.155 --> 00:41:03.066
TALIESIN: No! There will be a specific answer to
that if he lives as well.

00:41:03.066 --> 00:41:10.195
BRIAN: Hey, voice actors, talk into the mic, by
the way. It's amazing with these guys

00:41:10.195 --> 00:41:14.865
how often you have to tell them,
but you have to tell them that, and they do this

00:41:14.865 --> 00:41:15.984
for a living. I'm just kidding. What's your name?

00:41:15.984 --> 00:41:22.021
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm [inaudible]. valianteffort.
Matt, you mentioned before that you said that you

00:41:22.282 --> 00:41:27.432
had the Chroma Conclave arc planned for two years.
How much of that has evolved into the Vecna arc

00:41:27.432 --> 00:41:31.533
going into that? How much of all of that
specifically did you have planned?

00:41:31.533 --> 00:41:36.514
MATT: Oh man. I knew that I wanted Vecna to be the
final villain if we ever made it this far into the

00:41:36.514 --> 00:41:40.296
campaign. Because he is just your classic DnD
villain that I never had the opportunity to do.

00:41:40.296 --> 00:41:46.125
And [inaudible] Since that is has kind of been
building up to this arc, and recently coming to

00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:51.801
realize that I am going to have to represent Vecna
in front of a lot of people who have a lot of

00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.454
expectations with this character.

00:41:53.454 --> 00:41:54.744
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You are doing great!

00:41:54.744 --> 00:41:58.715
MATT: Aww, thank you.

00:41:58.715 --> 00:42:00.481
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Vecna, stand up!

00:42:00.481 --> 00:42:21.010
[laughter, applause]

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:26.883
MATT: Like any major arc, those DMs out there can
attest to this, you build out the structure in a

00:42:26.883 --> 00:42:30.834
basic narrative arc until you get to that point.
You flesh out, change things based on where the

00:42:30.834 --> 00:42:35.277
story goes. Things you can tie into it like, "Oh
it would be cool if this worked." I didn't have

00:42:35.277 --> 00:42:40.682
the whole thing plotted out. I had the basic three
act structure set. As they played through

00:42:40.682 --> 00:42:44.687
Whitestone, as they played through the Chroma
Conclave arc, as things began to happen, it began

00:42:44.687 --> 00:42:49.512
to solidify my idea of how to bring elements back
in and also try and make it different than

00:42:49.512 --> 00:42:55.133
previous arcs that have been played. The Conclave
was very much a cataclysm has happened, now it's

00:42:55.133 --> 00:42:59.832
trying to rebuild and eventually when you're ready
you go after the villain. This is a very different

00:42:59.832 --> 00:43:04.154
circumstance. The cataclysm is coming, but you
don't know when, and you don't know what's going

00:43:04.154 --> 00:43:07.282
to happen. I wanted to mix it up a little bit.

00:43:07.282 --> 00:43:10.015
BRIAN: Great question. Hey, what's your name?

00:43:10.015 --> 00:43:15.662
HANNAH: Hannah X. Hi guys. Quick question--

00:43:15.662 --> 00:43:17.983
BRIAN: Great shirt. It says Whitestone.

00:43:17.983 --> 00:43:26.955
HANNAH: Whitestone, everything is totally fine.
[inaudible] de Rolo. Quick question for the

00:43:26.955 --> 00:43:37.764
significant others, Travis/Laura, Marisha/Matt,
Sam and Liam? After a game, when you guys get

00:43:37.764 --> 00:43:42.360
whispers-- because this has happened to me where
the DM is plotting against myself, my husband--

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:47.083
are you interrogating each other in the car, like,
"What the eff was that all about? Why won't you

00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:49.404
"tell me what the whisper was about? Come on, tell
me."

00:43:49.404 --> 00:43:55.645
[laughter]

00:43:55.645 --> 00:44:05.094
TRAVIS: I don't say <i>shit.</i> No, we don't spoil it.
Even recently, when we all left the room and it

00:44:05.094 --> 00:44:08.585
was just Liam and Matt, I have not gone back and
watched what was said.

00:44:08.585 --> 00:44:09.753
LAURA: No, none of us know.

00:44:09.753 --> 00:44:10.794
TRAVIS: We don't want to know.

00:44:10.794 --> 00:44:11.805
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

00:44:11.805 --> 00:44:13.595
HANNAH: Laura, level up dicers?

00:44:17.325 --> 00:44:21.994
MARISHA: I will say that there are a lot of times
that people think that whenever Matt, almost every

00:44:22.004 --> 00:44:29.904
game, they are like, "Aww, shit. Marisha's going
to make Matt sleep on the couch tonight!" It never happens.

00:44:37.114 --> 00:44:40.100
MATT: It's good for the back posture.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.760
TRAVIS: I was in genuine trouble after making
Trinket run through that minefield.

00:44:44.842 --> 00:44:45.812
LAURA: He really was.

00:44:45.812 --> 00:44:50.542
TRAVIS: Everybody left, the door closed. Then the
face that turned to me.

00:44:50.542 --> 00:44:57.423
MATT: That is burned in my memory. That is the day
I learned never cross Laura Bailey.

00:44:57.423 --> 00:45:00.302
TRAVIS: She'll kill me in my sleep!

00:45:00.302 --> 00:45:01.653
LIAM: It took you that long?

00:45:01.653 --> 00:45:06.033
MATT: Look, you've known her longer than I have.
That was my moment.

00:45:06.033 --> 00:45:16.894
BRIAN: That night Travis approached the Taco Bell
with sad Hulk music playing. Okay, you look amazing.

00:45:17.233 --> 00:45:18.287
MARISHA: Yes!

00:45:18.287 --> 00:45:20.361
MATT: (as Gilmore) No, they don't: they look
<i>glorious.</i>

00:45:20.361 --> 00:45:28.231
[cheering]

00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:35.022
WINCHESTER: I am Winchester, currently
partygilmore on Twitter. My question is for the

00:45:35.225 --> 00:45:43.226
entire cast, but mostly for Laura Bailey. Speaking
of whispers, some time ago you went snooping in my

00:45:43.226 --> 00:45:49.864
room. You found a box under the bed. You found
letters in the box. You never told us what was in

00:45:49.864 --> 00:45:53.114
those letters, and I would like to know if you
would tell us what what was in those letters.

00:45:53.114 --> 00:45:58.074
[laughter]

00:45:58.074 --> 00:46:10.754
LAURA: I never told anyone, did I? I don't know,
can I tell? They were love letters, between

00:46:10.754 --> 00:46:16.064
Gilmore and his first boyfriend. They were really
sweet.

00:46:16.064 --> 00:46:18.344
WINCHESTER: That's all I needed, thank you.

00:46:18.344 --> 00:46:23.854
[applause]

00:46:23.854 --> 00:46:25.904
BRIAN: [inaudible]

00:46:25.904 --> 00:46:29.652
MARISHA: Party Gilmore, You didn't get a pin,
catch!

00:46:29.652 --> 00:46:31.607
BRIAN: You're drunk, get over here.

00:46:35.347 --> 00:46:36.657
MATT: Okay, take it!

00:46:40.337 --> 00:46:41.671
SABINA: Hey, Kiki.

00:46:43.365 --> 00:46:45.389
MARISHA: [inaudible] Sun Tree!

00:46:45.389 --> 00:46:54.939
[cheering]

00:46:55.144 --> 00:46:56.294
LAURA: That is amazing.

00:46:58.471 --> 00:47:00.251
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:06.272
SABINA: My name is Sabina. I am from Michigan. As
you guys might not know, I met Matt and Marisha

00:47:06.272 --> 00:47:12.431
last night. It's a question for all of you, but
it's super quick. If you could put your characters

00:47:12.431 --> 00:47:21.100
into a Hogwarts house, what house would it be?
Matt, your characters are Allura and Gilmore. Sam,

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.949
both Tary and-- Scanlan.

00:47:24.949 --> 00:47:28.209
BRIAN: Tary, and the other guy.

00:47:28.209 --> 00:47:36.670
MATT: I'll say Allura is Ravenclaw, most
definitely. I would probably put Gilmore in

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:44.095
Gryffindor. Borderline Hufflepuff, but more
Gryffindor. I'm Hufflepuff, by the way.

00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:52.477
LAURA: I am also Hufflepuff, I would put Vex, I
have seen a lot of people put her in Slytherin.

00:47:52.477 --> 00:48:01.629
Okay, it's a toss up between Gryffindor and
Slytherin. [inaudible] Don't shake your head!

00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:03.098
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm a Slytherin.

00:48:03.098 --> 00:48:04.158
LAURA: What?

00:48:04.158 --> 00:48:05.308
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm a Slytherin.

00:48:05.308 --> 00:48:05.828
LAURA: Okay.

00:48:06.918 --> 00:48:08.519
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm a Gryffindor,
it all works out.

00:48:11.869 --> 00:48:13.400
LIAM: Vax is Gryffindor.

00:48:13.623 --> 00:48:14.230
LAURA: Hide!

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.361
LIAM: I don't know, I'm in either Ravenclaw or
Hufflepuff.

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:19.092
LAURA: Hufflepuff!

00:48:19.092 --> 00:48:30.253
[audience debating]

00:48:30.253 --> 00:48:35.130
BRIAN: Okay, we need to move on from this Harry
Potter. I love Harry Potter, but we got to keep moving.

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:40.651
SAM: I don't know anything about Harry Potter
shit, so I am going to say: Scanlan is Team Valor

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:41.952
and Tary is Instinct.

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:50.012
[cheers, applause]

00:48:50.012 --> 00:48:51.531
TALIESIN: Ravenclaw for Percy.

00:48:51.531 --> 00:48:56.204
MARISHA: I'm confused. I feel like they asked the
question and people have answered it in four

00:48:56.204 --> 00:49:01.212
different ways. Marisha is Ravenclaw, Keyleth
would probably be Hufflepuff.

00:49:01.212 --> 00:49:07.194
TRAVIS: I am in Slytherin, but I think Grog would
probably get kicked out, so he would just be

00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:08.806
Hagrid's understudy.

00:49:08.806 --> 00:49:13.326
[applause]

00:49:13.326 --> 00:49:15.443
SABINA: Thank you all so much, you are amazing.

00:49:15.443 --> 00:49:19.714
BRIAN: You're amazing, [inaudible] that was great.
Hey, what's your name? Don't forget to get a pin

00:49:19.714 --> 00:49:22.020
from Rachel there. What's your name, man?

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:29.522
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, I'm [inaudible]. I was at the
live show last year and I loved it. Laura, since

00:49:29.522 --> 00:49:34.487
you forgot your dice tray, I'm sure if you went
down row 2500 in the exhibit hall to the Wyrmwood

00:49:34.487 --> 00:49:38.253
booth I'm sure they would loan you one. My
question, what--

00:49:38.253 --> 00:49:42.640
BRIAN: Do you work for them or is that just free
advertisement? Very sly.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:49.449
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Free advertising. I was going to
ask Matt about Raven Queen patronage for blood

00:49:49.449 --> 00:49:53.340
hunters, but I am going to give some love to the
nameless man between Marisha and Brian.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:06.867
BRIAN: [inaudible] You drop your wallet every
panel. Comic Con, San Diego, Wondercon-- I have

00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:08.117
picked up your wallet.

00:50:10.867 --> 00:50:16.677
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you were to DM a one shot,
what genre would it be? Like horror, like Liam, or

00:50:16.677 --> 00:50:21.999
something more fun or lighthearted, or maybe even
like magical girl?

00:50:21.999 --> 00:50:29.455
TRAVIS: Oh man, you are giving me way too much
credit. I have <i>no</i> idea, it would be some stream

00:50:29.657 --> 00:50:33.252
of consciousness bullshit [inaudible].

00:50:33.252 --> 00:50:34.548
TALIESIN: You have never heard of Blood Bowl, have
you?

00:50:34.548 --> 00:50:35.281
TRAVIS: No.

00:50:39.781 --> 00:50:45.452
TALIESIN: Like that Schwarzenegger film where you
kill everyone in a video game, except it's football.

00:50:45.452 --> 00:50:52.203
TRAVIS: Oh my god. I'd do that. Then I would make
all the characters play their Vox Machina

00:50:52.203 --> 00:50:55.378
characters and I would find a way for Vax to die
immediately.

00:50:55.378 --> 00:50:58.434
LIAM: I'd just get back up again!

00:50:58.434 --> 00:50:59.223
TRAVIS: I know.

00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:02.022
BRIAN: I get knocked down again. Thank you so
much.

00:51:02.022 --> 00:51:04.402
MATT: Stress ball, Vox Machina style.

00:51:06.502 --> 00:51:07.583
BRIAN: Hello.

00:51:10.023 --> 00:51:19.296
HANS: I'm Hans, [inaudible] on Twitter. My
question is for Brian and Matt. How long until

00:51:19.296 --> 00:51:21.363
Brian gets to guest on Critical Role?

00:51:21.363 --> 00:51:25.105
[applause]

00:51:25.105 --> 00:51:33.062
BRIAN: Can I answer this? Okay. I talk about this
sometimes on Reddit. I feel weird, the after show

00:51:33.062 --> 00:51:42.393
guy being on the show. Like if you saw-- not to
compare myself to Chris Hardwick-- but if you saw

00:51:42.393 --> 00:51:46.053
him walking around on The Walking Dead, some of
you may be like, "Aww, that's funny," but the rest of you

00:51:46.053 --> 00:51:52.024
would be like, "I hate this." I like to watch it
as a fan. I am also not a voice actor or an actor,

00:51:52.024 --> 00:52:01.084
so I feel like that is part of the excuse is that
you all are voice actors and Jon Heder. I don't

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:05.162
know. Sam, can we make an announcement?

00:52:05.162 --> 00:52:11.053
SAM: It puts a lot of pressure on me. I will be
running a one-shot in a week and a half.

00:52:11.053 --> 00:52:18.602
[cheers, applause]

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:21.301
SAM: One of my special guests is young Brian
Foster.

00:52:21.301 --> 00:52:25.912
[cheers, applause]

00:52:25.912 --> 00:52:27.834
BRIAN: [inaudible] as close to a Critical Role
one-shot thing.

00:52:27.834 --> 00:52:33.469
HANS: I have to ask a follow up. In that one-shot,
will you play a cabbage farmer named Larkin?

00:52:33.469 --> 00:52:42.421
BRIAN: I cannot answer that question. Thank you.
What's your name?

00:52:42.421 --> 00:52:50.182
CHRISTINE: My name is Christine. I am really
nervous. I left Fenthras over there, I was afraid

00:52:50.182 --> 00:52:52.021
to run into people with it.

00:52:52.021 --> 00:52:55.053
MATT: You are now unattuned.

00:52:55.053 --> 00:53:00.293
[laughter]

00:53:00.293 --> 00:53:07.568
CHRISTINE: It happens. Thank you guys so much for
doing what you do. I have a question for mostly

00:53:07.799 --> 00:53:15.840
Laura and maybe Matt. Ever since that episode with
Fenthras and Saundor, I have been thinking what

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:21.340
would have had happened if Vex had gone with him.
Would she have gone like evil Galadriel, or what

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:22.441
would have happened?

00:53:22.441 --> 00:53:25.667
LAURA: You can say, he's dead, anyways.

00:53:25.667 --> 00:53:32.719
MATT: To be fair, shortly after the episode, I
filmed the episode of GM Tips about notes and the

00:53:32.719 --> 00:53:39.190
internet zoomed in really close to my sheet and
found out elements of it. It's not super secret.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:42.920
LAURA: He told me this like right after
[inaudible]

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:47.270
MATT: Yeah, because at that point, you couldn't
get it, so I was like, oops.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.970
LAURA: [inaudible]

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:56.370
MATT: Both would have been interesting things. The
heart of the tree would have taken her into this

00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:08.881
embrace and she would have been turned into a fey
creature. She would have partially bark skin, much

00:54:08.881 --> 00:54:14.271
like Saundor had. It would have given her a bonus
to her armor class, a couple other things. It

00:54:14.271 --> 00:54:19.520
would have given her a few other bonuses, but I
can't remember all the things, more general fey

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.660
abilities and such.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.981
LAURA: Like it gives [inaudible] right?

00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:24.903
MATT: Yeah, but also gives you vulnerability to
fire.

00:54:24.903 --> 00:54:27.139
LAURA: Which would have been real bad going into
the--

00:54:27.139 --> 00:54:36.336
MATT: Thordak fight. Plus, you would have had
Saundor as a patron, which would have been real interesting.

00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:39.187
LAURA: Yeah, that would have sucked.

00:54:39.187 --> 00:54:46.739
MATT: When I was designing that, my thought was
that probably won't be long term, because yeah.

00:54:46.739 --> 00:54:53.459
LAURA: If I would have gotten with Saundor, would
I be dead right now? Would Vex have been gone by now?

00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:56.387
MATT: I don't know if you would have been dead,
but you would have been a very different person.

00:54:56.387 --> 00:54:57.578
LAURA: Ugh.

00:54:57.578 --> 00:55:00.758
MATT: I don't know if any of the Percy stuff would
have happened.

00:55:00.758 --> 00:55:04.017
MARISHA: [inaudible] You don't want male
aggression as your patron.

00:55:04.017 --> 00:55:10.277
[cheers, applause]

00:55:10.277 --> 00:55:14.800
MATT: I didn't expect you to choose it, but I had
a backup just in case you did. It would have been

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.675
its own unique interesting character arc for you.
I like what you did. I like what you chose.

00:55:18.675 --> 00:55:20.339
LAURA: Me too!

00:55:20.339 --> 00:55:23.219
CHRISTINE: Laura, I also bought dice in your
honor.

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:28.801
SAM: This next cosplay is so good.

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:36.780
[cheers, applause]

00:55:36.839 --> 00:55:43.779
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello everyone. I have a question
for Brian, because I keep hassling him about it on Twitter.

00:55:43.779 --> 00:55:44.819
BRIAN: Okay.

00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:48.533
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm a huge Brian W. Foster fan,
and since y'all support each other I thought you--

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:50.266
BRIAN: Y'all, both of you?

00:55:50.266 --> 00:55:56.911
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Brian has an EP on iTunes called
"Odessa" and it's amazing and you should listen to

00:55:56.911 --> 00:56:02.580
it. He also has the book, "Blackened White" which
I'm going to get him to sign tomorrow. I would

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:06.910
like for you to sing for us, Brian. Everyone knows
[inaudible]

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:08.110
BRIAN: Oh man, what do you want me to sing?

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.988
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Preferably, just the beginning of
"The Wine."

00:56:09.988 --> 00:56:17.620
BRIAN: Oh man, okay, what are the lyrics? This is
an old one. The beginning of it? ♫ Tommy

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:25.609
♫ Barlo, relieved of his sorrow, there's blood on
the roadway, where he died. ♫

00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:35.852
[applause]

00:56:35.852 --> 00:56:47.670
BRIAN: [inaudible] ♫ Every word you ever spoke.
Thirty years in silence smashing stones, holding

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.879
♫ onto holy roses. ♫

00:56:51.339 --> 00:56:55.339
[applause]

00:56:55.339 --> 00:56:58.547
BRIAN: You, wait over here and I'll sign
that book.

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:04.420
LIAM: Matt, Matt, Matt! How do I kill Vecna?

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.180
MATT: Don't tell him anything.

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:12.401
TRAVIS: We only have four minutes left, so we have
to lightning round.

00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:17.549
LAURA: Seriously, go check out "Odessa" because
[inaudible]

00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:26.434
ETHAN: Hi, I'm Ethan. This is for Mr. Mercer, if
this violates the GM no note things that you have

00:57:26.434 --> 00:57:33.139
just tell me and I'll ask later. Back in the
Sunken Tomb episode when Vex had that temporary

00:57:33.139 --> 00:57:40.448
leave of absence, you said something to Kash along
the lines of, "If you revive her, then you might

00:57:40.448 --> 00:57:46.805
"draw Vesh's attention." Did you have any sort of
mechanics in play for that, or was that flavor text?

00:57:48.116 --> 00:57:52.457
MATT: Well, flavor text. There's a difference
between mechanics and story elements that you will

00:57:52.457 --> 00:57:57.467
then bring mechanics in for. I hadn't plotted that
to happen; I didn't expect her to die. I didn't

00:57:57.467 --> 00:58:03.516
think to plan ahead in case Kashaw resurrected
her. In the spur of the moment, that made sense

00:58:03.516 --> 00:58:08.980
and then words happened. Then it would have
brought Vesh more towards the story, more than she

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.626
currently is. Vesh is an interesting god-- that
may be in future books-- who is not in the

00:58:13.626 --> 00:58:18.076
Tal'Dorei guide because Vesh and the relationship
to Kashaw is more based in another continent.

00:58:18.076 --> 00:58:20.666
Eventually the system will be expanded.

00:58:20.666 --> 00:58:22.770
BRIAN: Lightning round, who's up?

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:27.276
DANIELLE: Hi, my name is Danielle. My question is
for Matt. One of the great things about being a DM

00:58:27.467 --> 00:58:32.167
is we get to come up with lots of characters while
PCs only get to play one. If you could pick one

00:58:32.167 --> 00:58:38.922
character who you have played as an NPC to carry
as your own PC in another campaign, who would it be?

00:58:38.922 --> 00:58:51.236
MATT: Ooh, man. Yeah, that's a lot to pick from.
No, Victor is fun for short bursts. For a long

00:58:51.236 --> 00:58:58.001
term campaign, someone who is interesting and a
little bit different from myself. Senokir would be

00:58:58.001 --> 00:59:03.488
great. (as Senokir) Because this is how he would
be speaking the entire time.

00:59:03.488 --> 00:59:08.418
LAURA: Then you would be able to see the other
side of Senokir. That would be so cool.

00:59:08.418 --> 00:59:10.056
MATT: (as Senokir) That would be a lot of fun.

00:59:15.196 --> 00:59:24.562
BRIAN: Okay. This is going to be the last question
because over here, someone just put a blow dart in my--

00:59:26.376 --> 00:59:29.058
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is for Mercer. As a
fellow DM--

00:59:29.058 --> 00:59:31.655
BRIAN: Little closer to the mic so everyone can
hear you.

00:59:31.655 --> 00:59:41.799
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As a fellow DM, this is directed
at Mr. Mercer, when you have a near-TPK, or

00:59:41.799 --> 00:59:47.498
potentially have a TPK, how do you deal with that?
I noticed that a lot--

00:59:47.498 --> 00:59:49.808
TRAVIS: Why are you asking that tonight?!

00:59:49.808 --> 00:59:53.666
MARISHA: All these people [inaudible]

00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:58.230
BRIAN: Okay, let's go, speed it up. Speed it up
because we got to wrap up.

00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:01.187
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How do you deal with that? I know
that there is a lot of anger. Is there like a

01:00:01.187 --> 01:00:04.577
pizza party at the end to hopefully mend
relationships?

01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:12.304
MATT: Well, one of the roles of a GM is a
therapist, in a lot of ways. When things happen,

01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:16.399
you have to be emotionally available for those
players to help them through it and other players

01:00:16.399 --> 01:00:20.850
in the game as well. If a character dies, or if
it's a TPK, you have to prepare to like, "All

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:26.298
right guys, I'm going to take us out for drinks.
We are going to have a little wake for the party."

01:00:26.298 --> 01:00:37.523
If the party feels really attached to characters
and you don't want to actually ruin their lives,

01:00:37.523 --> 01:00:41.983
you can try to think of story elements to bring
them back. Like, all of a sudden they wake up as

01:00:41.983 --> 01:00:47.699
undead in the control of this mage and now the
campaign is to try to shed the shackles of undead.

01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:53.019
Or perhaps the [inaudible] brings them over into
another plane when their souls were to traverse,

01:00:53.019 --> 01:00:57.118
but there's something wrong when their souls go to
another plane. Now their story is being in the

01:00:57.118 --> 01:01:01.409
spirit realm fighting. You continue the story and
the players are really connected and you feel like

01:01:01.409 --> 01:01:07.234
they got robbed of a proper end. If you think they
are mature enough to handle it, then you buy them

01:01:07.234 --> 01:01:08.079
some drinks.

01:01:14.269 --> 01:01:18.693
BRIAN: Thank you all for coming out. Give these
guys a round of applause.

01:01:18.882 --> 01:01:29.879
[applause, cheering]

01:01:29.879 --> 01:02:16.974
