NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:04.043
MATT: Hello, my name is Matthew Mercer. I am a
voice actor and the dungeon master for Critical

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:09.976
Role here at Geek &amp; Sundry. And today’s episode of
GM tips touches on the spooky topic of

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.367
game master burnout.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:17.621 line:1
[intro music]

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:22.378
Game mastering burnout is a fear and real issue
for many folks who run ongoing games. As

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:26.479
incredibly fun and rewarding as it is, you need
quite the time commitment to continuously write,

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:31.357
organize, and run an RPG campaign on a regular
schedule. I know many who have lost interest or

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:35.236
just simply lost inspiration. And I’ve been there
myself a number of times and there’s nothing wrong

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:39.897
with that. It’s part of being a person. Life
circumstances change, other things have to take

00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:43.995
priority, or you’ve just grown tired of the
responsibility. So let us discuss some ways to

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:47.882
help alleviate any oncoming burnout or how to
comfortably deal with it if it should hit.

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:53.199 line:1
First off, don’t force yourself to do it if your
heart isn’t in it. Writer’s block kicking in?

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.520 line:1
Found a tangle in your narrative thread? Step away
from your notes for a while and take a walk or go

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.536
play some board games with friends. Watch a movie
at your local theater. Enjoy some fun space to not

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:07.828
concentrate on your GM-ing duties and return when
the inspiration strikes. If you’re supposed to be

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:12.123
running your game really soon and you have no idea
how you’re going to finish prep in time, consider

00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:17.178
letting your players know and postpone your game
session until you are ready. No one wants you to

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:19.327
kill yourself over it, trust me.

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:23.790 line:1
On that note, if it’s getting bad, let your
players know. Be honest about your worry and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.938 line:1
exhaustion and discuss among yourselves how to
best lend to your comfort. Consider if the regular

00:01:28.938 --> 00:01:33.597
schedule is just too difficult to balance among
your other life commitments and perhaps roll back

00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:39.198
to a more sparse gaming routine. Playing weekly?
Try playing bi-monthly for a while, or once a

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:43.857
month. This will give you more time and less
stress to be prepared for the next session.

00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:49.146
Players, please be respectful and understanding of
your GM’s fatigue. They are busting their ass

00:01:49.146 --> 00:01:52.467
every week to bring you joy. So just be as
supportive as you can.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:57.458 line:1
You can consider taking a break from the campaign
for a little while, allowing yourself to recharge.

00:01:57.458 --> 00:02:01.598
Talk with the group about this and if all is cool,
find a way in your current story arc to bring it

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:06.108
to a temporary halt. Either the adventurers
complete their current task and you can close the

00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:10.736
chapter cleanly. Or perhaps they fall into an
elaborate trap that locks them away for a time.

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:15.948
Consider a story beat you can end on that allows
you and the party to step away for a few weeks,

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:20.787
months, or longer and not feel like you’ve left
mid breath. This way players won’t return to your

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:26.673
table down the road super confused trying to
remember "Wait, but what was going on? Shit.

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:32.687
Right. Wait. No, I thought there was a guy with
that cursed thing. Didn't someone kill my dog? No,

00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:34.567
no, that was John Wick. Sorry."

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:39.027
Players, any of you itching to try your hand at
GMing a game for a while? How about gifting your

00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:44.037 line:1
hard working GM with some time off and offering to
run a short term campaign for the party and letting

00:02:44.037 --> 00:02:47.777
them play in it. Not only is that a wonderful way
to help them relax a while and offer them the

00:02:47.777 --> 00:02:52.059
opportunity to play in a game. But you yourself
may discover how much you enjoy running

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.809
your own game.

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:58.267
Well, thank you so much for watching this episode
of GM tips. I hope it was helpful for you. This is

00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:01.567
actually kinda cool. Before we filmed this the
crew let me know that they actually went into the

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:08.767
prop closet and found actual magical items which
is fucking crazy. This is apparently a War Mage

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:14.177
wand. It's +3 against spell attack rolls. I think
it's great. We have what looks to be a Vorpal

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:18.636
sword. Which is a little shorter than I expected
but apparently pretty functional. You should look

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:23.588
it up. It's pretty powerful. Legendary weapon. And
oh [beep], this one can be fun. I think this is a

00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:26.998
Girdle of Giant Strength. Which I'm wondering what
giant it is.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.437
[small bang and music]

00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:34.925
SATINE: I should probably read some labels before
I start putting things on. Girdle of Gender

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:44.750
Changing. Well then. Hello. I am Satine Phoenix
and I'll be taking over for the next run of GM

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.668
Tips. Stick around and prepare for my perspective
on game mastering ideas. See you on the internet.
