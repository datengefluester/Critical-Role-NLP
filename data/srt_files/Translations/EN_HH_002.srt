1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Wielding an oversized axe not quite your style?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,040
You find the panache and pageantry of wizard life

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
a tad too ostentatious?

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,840
You may just want to pull that hood up

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,120
and go rogue.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,560
Roll for stealth you pickpocketing bastards,

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,720
this is your rogue quick build for D&D 5e.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,280
Rogues are clever hands-on adventuring types who are quick on their feet

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,640
and nimble with their hands.

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,500
So your number one priority is dexterity

17
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,480
and since rogues can adapt to so many different walks of life,

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,340
your second highest stat depends on the sort of rake you mean to be.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
If you plan on being a mastermind or

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,160
dabbling as an arcane trickster, hit up intelligence.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,360
Or if you see yourself fast talking your way through all your problems,

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,440
well, then lean into charisma instead.

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,540
There are so many ways to go with rogue, but

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,700
let's focus on the core three for now

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,580
which you'll branch into at level three.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,120
First up is Thief,

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,660
your best bet for a jack-of-all-trades, dungeon delving scrapper.

29
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,620
You'll have faster hands, quicker steps, and at higher levels

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,540
you'll just get more sh*t done.

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,040
Next up is the Assassin, for those looking to be more lethal.

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,040
This is the path you'll want to take if you hope to set up elaborate assassinations,

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,160
taking a target out all in one go.

34
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,840
Friendly piece of advice though,

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,280
you might want to make sure you have a party willing to take the time

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,460
for such elaborately planned hit jobs.

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,320
Finally, for the rogue with a little spice thrown in,

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,880
you can choose the Arcane Trickster,

39
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,820
who uses magic to aid them in their morally Grey pursuits.

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,880
Put to good use, rogues can scout ahead,

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,900
find potentially deadly traps,

42
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,160
and get in at least one good shot before many fights get started.

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,940
Sometimes, finishing them before they've even begun.

44
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,320
On top of all that, rogues come with a HUGE boon.

45
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,960
The combination of Expertise and Reliable Talent.

46
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,360
Early on you can choose a handful of skills

47
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,360
that you get to double your proficiency bonus for.

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,340
Reliable Talent makes those same skills virtually failure proof,

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,480
making rogues the best in the realm at what we do.

50
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,720
Now get your hands dirty, and remember:

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,060
you might not see me, but I'll be watching.
