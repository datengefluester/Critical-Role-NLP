1
00:00:00,545 --> 00:00:02,988
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:08,524
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons! I got Liam
back via Skype, somehow after many episodes of him

3
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:10,389
fucking with me. I'm happy.

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:11,974
TRAVIS: Payback's a bitch, huh, buddy?

5
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:16,947
MATT: Anyway! Welcome! Laura will be here shortly;
she's in traffic coming from her session, so

6
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:20,678
she'll be joining us as soon as she gets here.
Probably next 30 minutes or so. In the meantime,

7
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,709
let's go ahead and hop into our announcements for
the evening.

8
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:23,424
SAM: Yay!

9
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,694
MATT: Returning tonight, we have our fantastic
sponsor, Loot Crate!

10
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,129
ALL: Loot Crate!

11
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:30,286
MATT: Loot Crate, thank you so much for being an
awesome sponsor. We've got Loot Crates here. We're

12
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:33,352
going to go ahead and do a quick unboxing and
then, Sam, you can tell us a little bit about it.

13
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:34,797
SAM: After the unboxing?

14
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:37,543
MATT: Sure! This is the--

15
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:39,477
TALIESIN: A Predator bottle opener!

16
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,255
MARISHA: It's a little Logan!

17
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:46,899
MATT: It's pretty awesome little-- it's a heavy
one! It looks like a die-cast, an actual metal,

18
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,628
die-cast Wolverine.

19
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:49,908
SAM: My son is going to love it.

20
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:53,862
MATT: This is actually, for the size of Wolverine,
this is actually weight-effective. It's accurate.

21
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,229
SAM: What theme is this?

22
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:55,945
TALIESIN: Primal.

23
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:56,697
TRAVIS: Primal.

24
00:00:56,697 --> 00:01:00,345
SAM: Primal. Hey, look! This looks an awful lot
like the shirt that Travis is wearing right now!

25
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:01,887
TRAVIS: I got mine early, bitches!

26
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:05,649
MATT: Look at that! Crispin's been smeared all
over Taliesin.

27
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,846
MARISHA: Is that a Winston shirt?!

28
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:07,628
TALIESIN: Yeah!

29
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:08,498
MARISHA: Holy shit!

30
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:09,152
TALIESIN: Right there.

31
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:09,961
MATT: That's pretty rad.

32
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,718
MARISHA: It's a Winston shirt!

33
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:11,401
MATT: Yeah!

34
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,285
MARISHA: That's cool.

35
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:13,494
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Winston.

36
00:01:13,494 --> 00:01:15,293
TRAVIS: I love the raptor electrified fence.

37
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:19,010
MARISHA: This is so going on our--

38
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,861
TRAVIS: Like, our backyard fence.

39
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,058
MARISHA: Yeah! The chicken coop!

40
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,265
TALIESIN: This is going on my chicken coop, man!

41
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:24,070
MARISHA: On your chicken coop! That's so cute!

42
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,946
SAM: You saw this already?

43
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:27,597
MATT: If you have a motorcycle, this should go on
there so you can ride with raptors through the

44
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,627
forest. That's the way to do it.

45
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:30,050
SAM: This is a really good box! The bottle
opener's really cool.

46
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,417
MATT: The bottle opener's cool.

47
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:32,451
TRAVIS: Predator helmet? Yes!

48
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:33,740
SAM: It's a Predator bottle opener.

49
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,053
TALIESIN: My brother was singing the praises of
this box this week.

50
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:37,903
MARISHA: Oh, man. This is a good box!

51
00:01:37,903 --> 00:01:39,875
SAM: This is a Primal pin.

52
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,113
TALIESIN: Oh, no! Does it do--

53
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:43,861
MARISHA: Does it turn into a raptor?

54
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:46,627
TALIESIN: It turns into a dinosaur! The box turns
into a dinosaur.

55
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:48,800
MATT: Like all good boxes should.

56
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,351
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can do this
really, really quickly.

57
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:57,697
SAM: What is this? There's a secret, hidden puzzle
thing. The pages are blank and it says "follow

58
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:00,151
"your instinct". What could it be?

59
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:01,104
MATT: Is it scratch and sniff?

60
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,004
SAM: I'm intrigued!

61
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:03,502
MARISHA: Is it scratch and sniff?

62
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:04,545
SAM: No, it's not.

63
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:05,647
MATT: It is definitely not.

64
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:08,824
TRAVIS: Follow your instinct:
lootcrate.com.

65
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,853
MARISHA: Tell us about Loot Crate, Sam.

66
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,944
SAM: Sam? Oh, Sam's not here.

67
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,326
TALIESIN and MATT: Oh, no.

68
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:15,736
SAM: I'm sorry, I think you mean--

69
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,944
TRAVIS: What the fuck.

70
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:20,668
SAM: (robot voice) SAM 3000!

71
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:22,794
(laughter)

72
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:23,942
SAM: You ready?

73
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,420
(laughter)

74
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:33,408
SAM: (robot voice) Greetings, humans of the year
2017! I am Sentient Advertising Mechanoid 5000 and

75
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:40,478
I am from the future! Sent from the Planet
Lootcrateopia to ensure you simple humans choose

76
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:48,786
the correct time path. After the Water War of
2018, the Oilpocalypse of 2019, and the Oprah

77
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:56,126
Winfrey Rebellion of 2020, your world was plunged
into a hellscape that lasted 2000 years. (Sam

78
00:02:56,126 --> 00:03:01,728
voice) There's more. (Robot voice) Until the just
and tolerant overlords of Fortune 500 company Loot

79
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:07,720
Crate, in their altruistic wisdom, united the
factions and brought peace to all by sending every

80
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:15,661
human a Loot Crate. The gesture worked, and all
other Fortune 500 companies: Apple, Kroger, the

81
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:18,176
evil warmongers of Johnson & Johnson--

82
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,711
(laughter)

83
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:24,815
SAM: (robot voice) -- perished under the might of
the Loot Crate armies. Now, all live in harmony.

84
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:29,883
You humans must begin the peaceful transition by
visiting primitive webpage

85
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:37,924
lootcrate.com/criticalrole. And use promo code
CRITICALROLE for 10% off this month's crate theme,

86
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:47,349
Investigate. Items from Stranger Things, Batman,
The X-Files, and Marvel's Jessica Jones. That

87
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:54,455
include a figure, detective must-haves, and our
awesome monthly tee and pin. I must return to my

88
00:03:54,455 --> 00:04:00,437
timeline. Until we meet in the future, good crate,
and may the loot be with you! Bleep! Blop! Blorp!

89
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:02,184
Bleep! Blop!

90
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:04,287
TRAVIS: Yes! Yes!

91
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:05,766
SAM: Oh, what, did I miss something?

92
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:06,982
MATT: You just missed him!

93
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:08,695
MARISHA: Sam, when did you get here?

94
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,221
TRAVIS: You blacked out, man; there was a time
traveler in this space!

95
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,091
SAM: Wow!

96
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,938
MARISHA: It was crazy!

97
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:15,918
MATT: I am a little disappointed you decided to
reveal your character for the

98
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:17,802
next campaign so early.

99
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:19,701
TALIESIN: So you're going to do a Loot Crate ad,
man.

100
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:23,465
TRAVIS: That was so-- That was new.

101
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:24,938
MATT: Thank you very much, Sam.

102
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,156
SAM: New character.

103
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:32,058
MATT: And thank you, Loot Crate, for sponsoring
this chaos. All right, let's get this going. We

104
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:38,756
put up a survey starting this week to try and get
a feel for the community at large of you guys. Get

105
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:42,989
a feel for who's watching, where they're watching
it from, what kind of future merch ideas you might

106
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:48,999
want to see from the show. We want to get a scope
of what the Critter base is, where it comes from,

107
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,536
and how many of you are out there. So, if you get
a chance, if you haven't yet, go to

108
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:59,861
geekandsundry.com/crsurvey. We're running it until
April 18th, so get on there and

109
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,227
let us know about you!

110
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,569
TALIESIN: It's pretty short and you can do it
during the break, maybe?

111
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,845
TRAVIS: I did it in a minute.

112
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,873
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's pretty short, pretty easy.

113
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:13,699
MATT: WonderCon is in two days, for us! It's this
weekend in Anaheim; we're going to be there

114
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,669
Saturday, at 2PM to 3PM at The Arena to do our
Talks Machina live panel, with a bunch of us up

115
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,920
there. With delivery coffee for Taliesin.

116
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,805
SAM: Get! You're in the shot, you're in the shot!

117
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:25,667
(laughter)

118
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:26,626
MATT: Thank you, Eric.

119
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,993
TALIESIN: Thank you Eric! Loot Crate!

120
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,357
MATT: So if you're coming, go ahead and check it
out. If you can't be there, that's okay, I think

121
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:33,122
we're filming the panel, I think.

122
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:34,749
TRAVIS: Yeah, it'll get put up at a later time.

123
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:40,823
MARISHA: It is going to be aired during Talks
Machina this week, in place of our normal show, so

124
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:43,773
if you miss it, you get to see the full panel in
its entirety.

125
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:44,675
TRAVIS: Yeah.

126
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:49,117
MATT: Right, we look forward to seeing you guys
there in a couple of days, so yay! Wednesday Club,

127
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,246
Taliesin!

128
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:56,259
TALIESIN: Yeah, we don't actually have a-- that
happened. We don't actually have a subject yet,

129
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:03,065
we're going through and taking suggestions from
Twitter and from the chatroom, but we will have that

130
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:08,182
probably figured out, I'm going to guess tomorrow
and probably a graphic on Monday, but Wednesday 12

131
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,987
to 2, we're talking comics, and it's going to be
fun, so we'll just-- come and

132
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:13,206
join us and we'll chill.

133
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,070
MARISHA: (accent) Talking comics.

134
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,946
TALIESIN: (accent) Talking comics.

135
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,126
MARISHA: (accent) Talking comics.

136
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,313
MATT: Great. I also want to mention the show Round
Table, it's up on Alpha if you want to check it

137
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:30,568
out. Me, Eric, Matt Colville, Adam Koebel, Mark
Hulmes, Satine Phoenix, TJ Storm, a bunch of

138
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:35,555
really amazing, talented GMs from all different
walks of life, all just talking about different

139
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:39,363
themes about gaming, tabletop gaming, and what it
means community, what it means philosophically,

140
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:43,898
what experiences can, you know, be improved or
lessened by it. It's a lot of great conversations.

141
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:49,114
If you get a chance to check it out, I recommend
it, I'm on a couple of them. Signal Boost has a

142
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:51,207
ringtone if I recall, right?

143
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,524
MARISHA: We released a ringtone (laughs).

144
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:55,207
MATT: As well as--?

145
00:06:55,207 --> 00:07:02,713
MARISHA: As well as-- so you can now get our theme
song as your ringtone on iTunes. We also released

146
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:10,254
a free screensaver, that you can download, based
off of the old flying toasters.

147
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:11,619
MATT: The After Dark, yeah.

148
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:12,871
MARISHA: After Dark, yeah, flying toasters.

149
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:14,091
MATT: We're still waiting for the WinAmp--

150
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:16,592
MARISHA: The WinAmp skin was cancelled, but we're
working on it.

151
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:17,676
MATT: Working on that one.

152
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:23,344
MARISHA: But yeah, we-- just because we thought it
was funny. That's how we choose to spend our free

153
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:29,051
time, is releasing free screensavers, yeah, so go
do that.

154
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:32,489
MATT: Awesome, thank you Marisha. Want to pass
this along: Will Friedle, our good friend here,

155
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:40,109
who plays Kash, Kashaw, he's going to be at the
Wales Comic Con in the UK, April 8th and 9th, so a

156
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,747
bunch of UK Critters, if you want to go to Wales
Comic Con and say hi to Kash, and tell him how

157
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:49,370
much you like him and his body of work, as well as
his awesome roleplaying on the show, go do it!

158
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,391
Because he's awesome, and you should go do that.
Me, Marisha and Taliesin actually were just

159
00:07:54,391 --> 00:08:00,427
announced for MomoCon this year, May 25th to the
28th, in Atlanta, Georgia. So, if you guys over in

160
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:05,350
the Georgia area are willing to make the journey,
we'll be there at MomoCon, doing panels and

161
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,959
signings and all kinds of fun, general hangout
stuff, so come see us there. And last but not

162
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,691
least, reminder, Talks Machina is Tuesday nights
at 7PM Pacific here, where our wonderful Brian

163
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:22,544
Wayne Foster brings us in in chunks, with
occasional members of the community to talk all

164
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:26,481
things nerdy and Critical Role-related, so come
check it out on Twitch, or Alpha.

165
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:30,179
MARISHA: (laughs) He brings us in chunks, that was
phenomenally worded.

166
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,301
MATT: He brings us in chunks!

167
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:32,004
TRAVIS: Murderous.

168
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:32,985
MARISHA: (laughs) Very murderous.

169
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:33,851
TRAVIS: Very Dexter of you.

170
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:35,828
MATT: I like to leave it vague, open to
interpretation.

171
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:37,487
MARISHA: Very shark-chummy.

172
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:41,323
MATT: It's what I'm here for, guys. And that, I
believe, is the end of our announcements.

173
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:42,500
Woo, okay.

174
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,738
LIAM: No, I have one last announcement.

175
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:45,892
MATT: Shit, no! Liam! All right, what is it?

176
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:51,643
LIAM: I would like to announce that my father is
hiding, six feet away from me, over there from my

177
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:56,710
Skype window. He rolled very high in his stealth,
and while he may not understand what my career is,

178
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,847
he believes that I have one.

179
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,750
(laughter)

180
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:08,151
MATT: Thank you, Liam. We've accomplished a lot
tonight, I'm glad we could do this together.

181
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:15,172
(laughs) All righty. So, without further ado,
let's dive in to tonight's

182
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:18,346
episode of Critical Role.

183
00:09:18,346 --> 00:10:50,584
[opening credits]

184
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:57,857
MATT: And welcome back. So, picking up where we
left off last week: Vox Machina, in tying up loose

185
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:03,965
ends after the end of the Chroma Conclave and the
completion of Keyleth's Aramente, they knew that

186
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:10,386
there was, out there, somewhere in the Hells, an
infernal being, a rakshasa known as Hotis, that

187
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:14,725
they had encountered previously in the past, and
was going to eventually claim vengeance on them,

188
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:19,831
if they did not get to it fast. As such, through
their research, they found that it most likely

189
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:27,387
seemed to reside on the second layer of the Hells:
Dis. Ruling under Dispater, one of the Archdevils.

190
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:35,169
And after gathering your materials, doing a bit of
prep, you transitioned into the actual plane of

191
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:41,678
the Nine Hells of Baator, into the City of Dis.
Upon wandering the streets and trying to blend in

192
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:48,646
through various alterations to your physical
forms, you eventually found your way to-- after

193
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:55,437
avoiding a couple of possible confrontations in
the street-- to a tavern-like location, where you

194
00:11:55,437 --> 00:12:00,627
decided not to order the meats that were being
devoured by a couple of devilish entities, and

195
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:02,030
instead the other thing.

196
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,893
(laughter)

197
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:11,349
MATT: Which involved both Taryon and Keyleth
having their first taste of soul. And eventually

198
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:17,480
Percival on the way out, too. You encountered the
owner of the establishment: a dark-haired,

199
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:28,768
red-skinned, horned gentleman, wings folded
against his back, who was eager to rent you a

200
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:35,361
place to stay for the time being. And you guys
decided to figure out what your plans were. At

201
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:41,758
which point, Freddie and Greg-- Percival and
Grog-- went downstairs to have a conversation with

202
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:50,573
this entity, where he revealed himself to be named
Ipkesh, and was interested in possibly working out

203
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:59,579
sort of a criss-cross, quid pro quo-type
negotiation with your team. After returning to

204
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:06,764
discuss the possibilities of this up in your
chambers, Keyleth made her way out to locate the

205
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:13,886
possible location of Hotis as a workaround. As she
exited the front exterior of the establishment and

206
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:20,420
went into an alleyway to attempt to transform, she
found herself followed by a chain devil and some

207
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:28,369
sort of a somewhat scarred and mutated-looking
dwarf. They confronted you and were asking about

208
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:34,438
their interest in "the white one", seeming
speaking about one of your companions, Vax, who

209
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:41,304
had taken on the form of an albino tiefling when
you entered the plane. We left off at a tense

210
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:47,828
moment, and that's where we pick up this week. As
you stand in the darkened, shadowed, uncomfortably

211
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:54,207
hot air in the center of this alleyway behind
these buildings, crushed in these very thin spaces

212
00:13:54,207 --> 00:14:01,168
with what looks to be a thinning exit behind you,
and these two devilish entities--or devilish

213
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:06,661
entity and some sort of a messed-up dwarf--
beginning to flank you with what looks to be

214
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:16,489
grotesque murder or thrill of coming pain in their
eyes and faces-- What do you want to do?

215
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,343
(laughter)

216
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:19,868
MATT: As you are alone--

217
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:24,339
SAM: She'll talk her way out of it, like she
always does!

218
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:26,168
(laughter)

219
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:35,888
MARISHA: I'll have a panic attack is what (clears
throat) I want to do. All right. Fuck me. Okay.

220
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:37,285
SAM: That's a good way to start.

221
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:44,729
MARISHA: Ugh, don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this
up. I am going to continue with my original plan.

222
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:56,259
Can't-- Getting cotton mouth. And, (laughs) And
I'm going to slowly start from the top down,

223
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:59,243
transforming-- forming--

224
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:00,384
SAM: Wow, wow.

225
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:01,649
MARISHA: Shut up, Sam!

226
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,413
MATT: Via, what are-- what are you using? What are
you using?

227
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:04,898
SAM: (laughs) This is rough already!

228
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:06,296
MATT: Are you using Alter Self?

229
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,448
MARISHA: No, I want to use Shapechange.

230
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,329
MATT: So you're casting Shapechange?

231
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:13,105
MARISHA: Yes. Right? Because I can't Alter Self
into an erinyes.

232
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:15,993
MATT: No, you cannot. But however, you did not
quite cast Shapechange last time--

233
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:16,685
MARISHA: Right.

234
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,089
MATT: -- we had spoken. So you're doing it now.

235
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,032
MARISHA: So I'm doing it now.

236
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:26,542
MATT: Okay. So. As they both begin to slowly flank
from the sides of the alleyway, and you're holding

237
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:31,845
your ground, insisting that this 'white one'
they're asking about belongs to you, they didn't

238
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:38,712
seem to buy your attempt at claiming territory, so
you begin to mutter the incantation beneath your

239
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:43,024
breath, your hands move, and you watch as you do
so, the chains of the chain devil begin to--

240
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:50,073
continue to grind and shift around it, like a
hundred serpents of grinding metal, and the dwarf

241
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:54,614
figure, she begins sauntering up on the other side
with this heavy limp, as you watch the flesh

242
00:15:54,614 --> 00:16:00,930
tearing with small tendrils revealing beneath,
like a series of worms are almost emerging from

243
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,432
various folds and gashes in the flesh of the arm.

244
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:04,859
SAM: Ugh.

245
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:08,572
MATT: You complete your Shapechange spell as
they're pulling in on you: what do you turn into?

246
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,441
MARISHA: An erinyes.

247
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:12,975
MATT: Oh sh-- okay!

248
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:16,140
SAM: What was that? What was that? What's that do?
What's an erinyes?

249
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,648
MARISHA: It's that thing that we fought in the
City of Brass.

250
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:19,837
SAM: Ooh! Cool!

251
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:23,325
MATT: Yeah, they have Challenge Level 12, so you
can do that. Okay. So.

252
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:27,128
MARISHA: There was like the devil that we
fought--

253
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:28,536
LIAM: Lady demon with Pit Fiend.

254
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:31,813
MATT: Yeah, the one that the Pit Fiend summoned
next to it. So you have actually encountered it.

255
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:33,492
TRAVIS: That winged biatch.

256
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:38,276
MARISHA: Yeah, the one that you squared up against
with, for most of the time.

257
00:16:38,276 --> 00:16:39,562
TRAVIS: Yeah, she didn't want none.

258
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:41,120
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

259
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,804
MATT: As you finish the incantation, your skin
goes to a pale white, your eyes becoming dark,

260
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:55,525
deep red with these little burning, golden coals
for pupils. The rest of your skin grows fair but

261
00:16:55,525 --> 00:17:02,102
thick, with a very, very fine series of scales
across it as these giant black, red wings emerge

262
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:09,287
from your back and unfold. As they extend past you
in both directions, enveloping both sides of this

263
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:15,313
alleyway, both the chain devil and the dwarfish
entity stop in their tracks and take a couple of

264
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,560
steps back, looking at you intensely.

265
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,599
MARISHA: (deeper voice) You know, I never did
catch your name.

266
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:29,015
What do they call the two of you?

267
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:32,111
MATT: Make an intimidation check. With advantage.

268
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,125
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's good! That's a good plan!

269
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,512
SAM: Advantage? Do it, do it, do it!

270
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,629
MATT: Because you are, you look like a higher
ranking devil.

271
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,930
TRAVIS: You got this. In the City of Dis.

272
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,212
MARISHA: You got Dis!

273
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:42,577
TALIESIN: You got Dis.

274
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,961
MARISHA: Oh, I'll take that 18.

275
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:51,492
And I think my intimidation's an eight--
No, it's a seven. So-- 25.

276
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,276
MATT: (laughs) 25.

277
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:54,177
MARISHA: Yeah.

278
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:55,049
TRAVIS: Wow!

279
00:17:55,049 --> 00:18:01,147
MATT: So, as you asked for their name, the chain
devil-- the chains begin to slow and come to a

280
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:05,376
halt, and what was originally curling upward in
this aggressive stance begin to just fall limp to

281
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:14,052
its sides, and just takes another step back. "No
need to worry, we apologize for the intrusion."

282
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:20,847
MARISHA: Are you sure? Because I would love to
know, maybe add you to the collection.

283
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:26,679
MATT: The chain devil bows its head and begins to
step back, and you see it ushering its hand this

284
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:32,223
way, towards the dwarf, the dwarf which is looking
confused and begins to hobble backward. And they

285
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:38,268
both just back out of the alleyway in a very
submissive, apologetic physicality, without even

286
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:39,518
saying a word.

287
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,673
MARISHA: Oh, what's the matter! Where're you
going?

288
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:43,732
SAM: Just let 'em, just let 'em go!

289
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:48,693
MARISHA: And then I turn around, and I (strained)
just start walking cool--

290
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:51,325
SAM: You can fly!

291
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:57,280
MARISHA: (whimpers) Yeah, I can fly! That's also,
this is a concentration spell.

292
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,325
MATT: Yes it is.

293
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:07,124
MARISHA: So, I can't do-- Okay, so I'm going to,
as I-- Is anyone looking around? Anyone looking

294
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:08,076
around right now?

295
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:09,813
MATT: Make a perception check.

296
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:13,945
MARISHA: God damn it. 22.

297
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:21,440
MATT: 22. You glance up, and right on the edge of
one of the three- to four-story curved iron

298
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,742
towers, you see what appears to be an impish-like
creature perched on the end with what looks to be

299
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:30,531
faint, shimmering gold armor that's just peering
down at you from the top of the alley.

300
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:41,682
MARISHA: I look at it.

301
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:45,286
SAM: Ooh!

302
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:47,380
MARISHA: And I just nod.

303
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,181
MATT: It doesn't react. Its head twitches a little
bit, and it just sets back in itself, looking at

304
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:59,783
you, its eyes these gleaming black, shining discs
in the darkness.

305
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:04,097
MARISHA: And then I start heading back towards the
tavern.

306
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:09,792
MATT: It just watches you. And as you exit the
alleyway from where you came, the two devils that

307
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:14,795
attempted to assail you there, no longer anywhere
in sight, the--

308
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:19,523
MARISHA: Before I round the corner, I want to just
take and do a quick Shapechange again into the

309
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:21,986
tiefling that I was.

310
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:25,340
MATT: Okay. As your form changes as you turn the
corner--

311
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,590
MARISHA: Into the tavern.

312
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,442
MATT: -- into the tavern. Yep.

313
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,096
MARISHA: Go upstairs to the rest of the group.

314
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,171
SAM: Nice!

315
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,259
TRAVIS: Did you pee on yourself?

316
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,226
MARISHA: (panicked gasping) Okay! Okay!

317
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,926
TALIESIN: What? What happened? How'd it go?

318
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:38,987
MARISHA: I didn't make it far! I didn't make it
far.

319
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,265
TRAVIS: You ate the meat, didn't you?

320
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:41,321
MARISHA: Woo!

321
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:42,882
LIAM: Well, how far are we talking about?

322
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:51,752
MARISHA: I made it around the corner, and the two
devils that seemed to be very interested in you,

323
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:55,567
Vax, cornered me-- (nervous laugh)

324
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,224
LIAM: Me?

325
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,276
MARISHA: Huh?

326
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,814
LIAM: In me? Why?

327
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:06,682
MARISHA: I have a feeling it has something to do
with your deity.

328
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:10,548
LIAM: All right.

329
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:13,841
TRAVIS: What? Your deity? Why?

330
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:21,376
MARISHA: I think they can tell that Vax is
special. I think-- He has value down here.

331
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:24,349
TRAVIS: You have value?!

332
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,492
(laughter)

333
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:30,058
LIAM: It's the first I'm hearing about it, trust
me.

334
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:36,381
MARISHA: They said they were interested in 'the
white one.' And I couldn't help but notice that

335
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:40,524
you were turning quite a few heads when we were
walking through town.

336
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:49,907
LIAM: Well, do you think that's because of the
Raven Queen? Or is it because of the choice of

337
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:55,936
appearance I picked? I mean, we've met an albino
tiefling before, it didn't seem like that

338
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:57,519
outlandish a choice.

339
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,410
MARISHA: I don't think it has anything to do with
the way you looked.

340
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:06,560
TALIESIN: I'm not entirely sure. I mean, they
didn't react-- Did they react strangely to you

341
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,190
when we came into the bar?

342
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,002
LIAM: Not that I noticed, no.

343
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:16,834
TRAVIS: So does that mean that he has to change
again now?

344
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:17,987
TALIESIN: No.

345
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:20,261
TRAVIS: No?

346
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:25,763
MARISHA: I don't think it matters what he turns
into, I think people will be able to tell the aura

347
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:27,218
that he carries with him.

348
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:29,598
TRAVIS: What? A bit like a process of
divination--

349
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,579
(laughter)

350
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,590
TRAVIS: -- like, he changes, and then we know what
it is or not, what?

351
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,004
TALIESIN: I think that's actually very impressive,
it is actually a process of divination,

352
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:37,795
technically, that's just very--

353
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:39,249
SAM: Some sound reasoning.

354
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:40,501
TALIESIN: Somehow you wandered right back to it.

355
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:41,973
TRAVIS: Don't lose your wits down here, it's real
important.

356
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:43,059
TALIESIN: No.

357
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:50,182
LIAM: This is just an extra wrinkle into a larger
problem. So, what's the move now?

358
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:59,599
MARISHA: Well, I can do this for about another 55
minutes! Before we'd have to sleep before I can do

359
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,818
it again!

360
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:05,448
SAM: Do we have to go anywhere? Are we late to any
appointments?

361
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:08,482
TRAVIS: I forgot what it was you left to go do,
actually! (laughs)

362
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:13,003
TALIESIN: She was going to research the notion of
other options other than dealing with the deal we

363
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,056
have downstairs.

364
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:14,841
TRAVIS: Right!

365
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,375
MARISHA: I was going to go see if I could get a
bead on where Hotis is. Oh! What, guys, check this

366
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,910
out, this is what I freaked 'em out with. And I go
back into the erinyes form.

367
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,804
MATT: You watch the wings (whoosh) unfurl, her
skin going pale--

368
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:25,841
TALIESIN: All right.

369
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,685
MARISHA: (deeper voice) Check it out. Check it
out, that's pretty hot, right? It makes my--

370
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:28,775
SAM: That is amazing!

371
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,334
MARISHA: -- it makes my voice a little smokey when
I'm down here too, right?

372
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:31,403
SAM: Whoa! Whoa!

373
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:32,282
MARISHA: I know.

374
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:33,619
SAM: What are you right now?!

375
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,054
MARISHA: I'm an erinyes.

376
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:38,112
SAM: How do you spell that?! Doty, take that down!
Erinyes!

377
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,346
TRAVIS: How do you say it?

378
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:40,165
MARISHA: It's with an 'e'.

379
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:41,499
TALIESIN: E-R-I-N-Y-E-S.

380
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:42,279
TRAVIS: Ear-in-es.

381
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,376
TALIESIN: Air-in-es.

382
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:44,487
MARISHA: Erin. Like Erin-yes!

383
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:45,346
SAM: Wow.

384
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:46,870
LIAM: Yeah, it's got yes-bait right in.

385
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,253
MARISHA: Yeah.

386
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:53,468
TALIESIN: Well. Do you still want to look into
other options, or do we want to just-- We could

387
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:56,463
take the deal. We could reverse the deal.

388
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:59,445
TRAVIS: Wait, you said they like left you alone
once you changed into that thing?

389
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:00,277
MARISHA: Yes.

390
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:02,278
TRAVIS: Well, why didn't you just keep going,
then?

391
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:07,891
MARISHA: Well, changing into this thing meant that
I had to drop concentration on my

392
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:09,720
Locate Creature spell.

393
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,528
TRAVIS: Ohh.

394
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:13,814
MARISHA: I can only concentrate on one thing at a
time. It gets-- Especially this, it's a lot to

395
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:15,790
mentally focus on.

396
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,263
TALIESIN: It's very impressive.

397
00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:24,771
SAM: You know, in my readings of this place, the
Hells-- Of any hell, really (laughs)-- They

398
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:31,530
typically are, at least in literature, reflected
as horrible places where lots of bad things happen

399
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:39,008
wherever you go. So having a deal presented in
front of us that is not horrible is, I think, a

400
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:44,233
pretty winning deal. I mean, I feel like we're
already ahead of the game if we are not being

401
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,661
actively murdered during the course of events.

402
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:52,635
TALIESIN: I would also like to point out that the
definition of 'research', in this instance, is

403
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:58,192
just reading the notes that I took last week,
reading and doing actual research.

404
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,039
SAM: I do my own reading, thank you.

405
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:03,146
TALIESIN: You did! You did reading of the notes I
wrote.

406
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:06,076
SAM: Well, then I guess we're in accord. (laughs)

407
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:09,266
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't you, like, brainy buddies just
like exchange notes every day, anyway?

408
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:10,269
SAM: Of course!

409
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,881
TALIESIN: I don't feel like I should have lost
that one.

410
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:13,976
MARISHA: I noticed--

411
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,083
TALIESIN: (sighs)

412
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:21,582
MARISHA: Just let it go, Percy. I noticed we're
being watched, I think at every turn. There was a

413
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:23,835
little imp guy watching me when I came in.

414
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:29,112
TALIESIN: Was it actually an imp? Imps are very
common. Everyone's being watched, it's a city

415
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,484
under surveillance.

416
00:25:30,484 --> 00:25:34,466
LIAM: We saw an imp back in Krieg's house, did it
look like that?

417
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,891
TALIESIN: Gold armor? Or wasn't that the one at
Krieg's house?

418
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,512
MATT: It did not have gold armor, the one that you
saw at Krieg's.

419
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:40,696
TALIESIN: Which one did we see? Was it just-- I
don't--

420
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:42,873
LIAM: The little bastard in the library at Krieg's
house.

421
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:45,147
MATT: Well, that was in Krieg's-- Technically it
wasn't in Krieg's house--

422
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:46,152
LIAM: No?

423
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:49,399
MATT: That was in father, what's the
character's--

424
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:50,734
TRAVIS: It was upstairs in the--

425
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:56,427
MATT: Yeah, it was the first-- when you first came
to Emon, it was the ally to your father, Vax.

426
00:25:56,427 --> 00:25:57,310
TALIESIN: Oh!

427
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,366
LIAM: Oh, that's right.

428
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,524
MARISHA: Oh, shit, that's right, your dad!

429
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:04,663
MATT: And he was the one that was found slain, or
was in the process of being killed by--

430
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,936
LIAM: That's right, that's right.

431
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:06,873
MATT: -- by entities.

432
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:07,922
TALIESIN: In the basement?

433
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:08,636
MATT: Yeah.

434
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:09,956
TALIESIN: Oh my god, that was a long time ago!

435
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:10,921
MARISHA: A long time ago.

436
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:14,024
LIAM: The slaying, right. The slaying was in the
basement, but the imp was in a library upstairs--

437
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:15,927
MATT: Yes! Yes.

438
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,443
LIAM: -- in our house. And he was just a little
prick.

439
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:21,177
TRAVIS: I forgot about that. I kept a ring off
that demon that we killed. It's in the bag of

440
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:22,073
holding.

441
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,017
MARISHA: Wait, did you really?

442
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:23,659
TRAVIS: Yep.

443
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:24,701
TALIESIN: That's like seven haircuts ago.

444
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:25,686
MARISHA: Well, get that--

445
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:26,653
SAM: Whip it out.

446
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:27,598
MARISHA: Get that-- can I-- Get that out. Get that
out.

447
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:28,581
TRAVIS: Why, what do you want?

448
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:29,331
SAM: Might be useful.

449
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:30,009
MARISHA: Yeah.

450
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:31,152
TALIESIN: I'll trade you something for it.

451
00:26:31,152 --> 00:26:31,623
MARISHA: Percy--

452
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,657
TALIESIN: My glasses.

453
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,012
MARISHA: Your-- (laughs)

454
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,749
(laughter)

455
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:40,478
TRAVIS: You! You! I'm not going to fall for that!

456
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:43,810
TALIESIN: It was worth-- the joke was worth the
ring alone, I would imagine. We were going to give

457
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,080
it back, we just want to see it.

458
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,568
TRAVIS: So that big demon, that like body slammed
me on that spike? Piece of shit. I took this ring

459
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:56,530
off of his finger, forever ago. And I kept it. I
take it out.

460
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,376
SAM: Let's have a look! I'll cast Identify on it.

461
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:09,123
MATT: Okay. The ring has no specific magical
properties to it, but it is a signet of some kind.

462
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:13,534
There is a symbol on it-- Roll a religion check,
actually.

463
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,283
TALIESIN: Can I aid with a history or religion as
well?

464
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:16,955
TRAVIS: Sorry, that's from like, three years ago.

465
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:18,080
SAM: 19.

466
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,317
TALIESIN: Can I help with him with that? History
or religion?

467
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:22,634
MATT: This would be religion.

468
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:23,530
TALIESIN: All right.

469
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,797
TRAVIS: That's one of the oldest things in this
bag.

470
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:25,846
MATT: Yeah.

471
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,552
TRAVIS: There's only one other thing that's
older.

472
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:29,032
TALIESIN: An 11 on top of that, so--

473
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:30,083
MATT: Okay.

474
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,521
LIAM: What's the one thing that's older?

475
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:37,643
TRAVIS: It's an onyx statue that we found down in
the cell that you were in.

476
00:27:37,643 --> 00:27:45,406
MATT: That he was in, yeah. So, the two of you
both conjecturing about it, the symbol here is one

477
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:49,034
that you picked up specifically in the tome you
did research earlier. It is the symbol of

478
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,277
Asmodeus.

479
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:53,163
TALIESIN: It is the symbol of Asmodeus, I would
have instantly recognized it, at this point.

480
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:54,920
SAM: Asmodeus. I was going to say that as well.

481
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,251
TALIESIN: You, of course you were going to say
Asmodeus, because it's like written six times in

482
00:27:57,251 --> 00:28:00,575
my notes, and I'm literally staring at a sketch of
it in my notes.

483
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:01,582
MATT: Asmo-day-us.

484
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:03,184
SAM: I feel like we're sympatico on this.

485
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:06,376
TRAVIS: Can we use it? Is it something that'll get
us like, a backstage pass to an

486
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,048
audience of some kind?

487
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:14,058
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a long look at this
thing. Is this some sort of mark of-- Is this a

488
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:21,553
marker? Some sort of favor marker? Is this a
signet of stature? Is this a-- You don't just put

489
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:23,096
this on anything.

490
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:25,071
TRAVIS: It's mine, don't forget.

491
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:29,013
MATT: It seems, from best you can tell-- Make an
intelligence check, actually.

492
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:30,855
TALIESIN: All right.

493
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:32,279
SAM: I should probably assist.

494
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,240
TALIESIN: Yeah, please.

495
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,237
TRAVIS: Yep, me too.

496
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:37,212
TALIESIN: Oh, yes please.

497
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:38,865
SAM: We got two natural ones.

498
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,166
MATT: (laughs)

499
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,089
TRAVIS: 13!

500
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:41,967
MARISHA: Did you really?

501
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:42,582
SAM: Yeah.

502
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:43,399
MARISHA: Holy shit!

503
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,647
TALIESIN: It's a nose ring!

504
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:50,328
SAM: I think it's a, uh. A contact lens!

505
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:56,700
TALIESIN: I think that it is, in fact, a-- some
sort of-- I don't know, it's a-- Napkin ring.

506
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,962
(laughs) For tiny napkins.

507
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:01,928
MATT: As far as you guys know, it looks pretty
damn important. That's the only thing you can

508
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:02,938
ascertain.

509
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:06,148
MARISHA: Let me, let me see if I can get something
out of it.

510
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:07,286
TALIESIN: That's fine, I don't care.

511
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:08,432
MARISHA: Can I scry on it?

512
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:09,766
SAM: Scry?

513
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:12,271
MARISHA: Like scry and see if it shows me
something?

514
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:15,018
TALIESIN: Oh! Object scry?

515
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:16,788
MATT: Let me see.

516
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,326
MARISHA: Is that-- a thing I-- no?

517
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:21,444
MATT: I mean, if you focus on an item, you can use
that item to try an improve a scrying attempt if

518
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:23,752
you're looking for a specific individual or
location.

519
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:24,888
MARISHA: Individual.

520
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,096
MATT: But I don't think the Scrying spell directly
allows you to, to--

521
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:31,800
TALIESIN: There is a spell that does that,
though-- Object History.

522
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,921
SAM: Yeah, we don't have that.

523
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:35,020
MARISHA: I don't have that.

524
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,771
TRAVIS: If you're curious, the person it belonged
to is dead.

525
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:37,577
SAM: Oh!

526
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:38,486
TRAVIS: We killed him.

527
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,046
MARISHA: Oh, I know.

528
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:45,510
TALIESIN: The symbol on this object, though, is
more or less the ruler of this dimension, so it

529
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,624
could be useful for something.

530
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:52,705
SAM: Why don't we keep it handy, no pun intended,
and we'll just flash it if we get in trouble, and

531
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:53,757
see if that helps us.

532
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:54,753
TRAVIS: How is that a pun?

533
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:55,485
MARISHA: Okay.

534
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:56,743
TALIESIN: I was actually thinking the same thing,
I don't understand how that was--

535
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:58,240
SAM: It's a ring. I said handy.

536
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,173
TRAVIS: That's a stretch.

537
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,945
LIAM: I caught it.

538
00:30:00,945 --> 00:30:02,541
(laughter)

539
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:07,593
LIAM: I'm sorry to say.

540
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:13,794
SAM: Well. Are we taking this deal, or are we...
not?

541
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:15,519
TRAVIS: Are we doing it on our own?

542
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,374
MARISHA: You know, this imp that I saw did have
sparkly gold armor, he may be like an important

543
00:30:20,374 --> 00:30:26,508
imp. I'm just saying, I feel like everyone's here
wanting to make a deal. It might be good to talk

544
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:28,038
to others.

545
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:31,047
LIAM: Vex, you're being awfully quiet, what do you
think we should do right now?

546
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:32,564
(laughter)

547
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,205
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, Vex!

548
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:37,310
MATT: Vex, at this point, is watching the whole
thing, and she goes, "Well, to be perfectly

549
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,289
"honest, I haven't heard much detail about this
deal that you apparently seemed to make. What do

550
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:43,884
"we make of the deal?"

551
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:53,484
TALIESIN: The owner of this establishment we're
staying in works for a man he doesn't like. Is

552
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:58,262
curious what would happen if he wasn't working for
that man, if he was suddenly, for reasons,

553
00:30:58,262 --> 00:31:04,706
unavailable. And for that, we would probably be
arrested, if we dealt with it inappropriately, and

554
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:10,982
we would be in a position to be-- make our enemy
accessible, I suppose. We have to be a bit cagey,

555
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:15,720
there are ears, apparently, everywhere. Even
here.

556
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,411
MARISHA: I feel like we don't need to make a deal
to go murder someone to get arrested. I feel like

557
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:28,046
I could just go streaking in the street and just
say words, and we would get arrested.

558
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:29,205
TALIESIN: As, actually--

559
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:30,432
TRAVIS: That's true.

560
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,562
TALIESIN: Strangely, excited by that plan as I
am--

561
00:31:32,562 --> 00:31:40,980
MARISHA: Why do we need to commit this crime, and
then suffer the apt consequences?

562
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,504
TRAVIS: Yeah, but Keyleth, once we're arrested,
he's supposed to, like, shuffle us in, y'know, on

563
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:46,876
the low-low, into--

564
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:47,988
MARISHA: Can he get us out?

565
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,029
TRAVIS: Yeah.

566
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,142
TALIESIN: Well, where we need to be, yeah. Out
never came up.

567
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,483
MARISHA: Out never came up?!

568
00:31:52,483 --> 00:31:58,670
TALIESIN: You're our out. We leave all of this
behind once all that's taken care of.

569
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,661
MARISHA: Then why do we need him as our in?

570
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:02,156
TRAVIS: Because we have no other plan at this
point.

571
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:03,699
TALIESIN: At this point we have no other plan.

572
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:08,448
TRAVIS: You were supposed to go find something,
(singsong) but you got followed by demons.

573
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:20,341
MARISHA: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I could do--
attempt something similar. Potentially with a

574
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:24,221
higher-level version of my Locate Creature
spell--

575
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:24,938
TRAVIS: Oh?

576
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:29,740
MARISHA: -- which is Find the Path, which could
get us close. Potentially.

577
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,501
TRAVIS: What if the guy he wants us to kill is
like a real piece of shit?

578
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:34,927
TALIESIN: They're all pieces of shit!

579
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:36,940
SAM: Everything down here is a piece of shit.

580
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,525
TRAVIS: Does anybody have a problem with that?
It's just like, y'know, piece of shit: (killing

581
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,194
noise), and he's gone.

582
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,146
TALIESIN: The only problem I have with it--

583
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,080
SAM: I like it.

584
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,227
TRAVIS: Thank you, Tary.

585
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:49,084
TALIESIN: -- and the only reason I'm even being
vaguely hesitant about any of this is because

586
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:53,723
they're all pieces of shit, including the one that
we're making any sort of bargain with.

587
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:54,702
TRAVIS: Okay.

588
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:57,475
TALIESIN: And they are professional bargainers,
and I know we're missing something.

589
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,561
TRAVIS: We kill him, too.

590
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:04,685
MARISHA: It's a Lawful Evil dimension. If he wants
his boss dead, that means that there's going to be

591
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:10,563
someone else above him. If we kill one guy, who's
all going to want to kill us?

592
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:13,740
TRAVIS: Did he ask, like, a decision by a certain
time?

593
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,512
TALIESIN: I don't recall-- So, I said I would have
it within a day or so, if I recall--

594
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:19,980
MATT: Yeah, you said 'fairly promptly.'

595
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,973
TRAVIS: Well, fuck, we've got a day! Let's go
explore, see what we can find.

596
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:26,480
TALIESIN: And if we're going to decide to trust
him, we could also show him the ring and see what

597
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,860
he makes of it.

598
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,388
TRAVIS: Not the ring! God, not the ring-- I mean,
I, fuck, I totally forgot

599
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:32,235
about that ring until now.

600
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:37,382
MARISHA: He's literally still holding it in his
hand in front of your face, you just--

601
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,999
TRAVIS: Yeah, I need it back.

602
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,559
SAM: What will you do with it?

603
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,354
TRAVIS: Me?

604
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,204
SAM: Yes.

605
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:43,074
TRAVIS: I'm going to wear it!

606
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:43,999
SAM: All right!

607
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:47,386
TRAVIS: Yeah. Does it fit on any of me giant,
Oscar Meyer fingers?

608
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:48,931
(laughter)

609
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:54,035
MATT: It fits partway down your pinkie, but it
gets caught on, like, the first knuckle.

610
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:59,685
MARISHA: Ooh, look at you! Oh my gosh! Wow.

611
00:33:59,685 --> 00:34:01,979
MATT: It's like he went to Claire's.

612
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:08,555
TRAVIS: Property of Asmodeus! Ass-modeus--

613
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:14,048
TALIESIN: This never ends well. Let's forego
disguises.

614
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:16,271
TRAVIS: Oh, wait, you ready to go?

615
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:20,481
TALIESIN: We're going to just drain ourselves the
more we pretend to be something we're not, and

616
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:23,131
obviously it's not helping us not attract
attention.

617
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:25,919
TRAVIS: Vax, you got any problem with that?

618
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:33,580
LIAM: I mean, I don't know what the deal is with
the people who are interested in me. I can't tell

619
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:40,945
if one's better or worse. But we're just going to
go waltz out into town and see what happens, is

620
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,421
that the idea?

621
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:49,171
TALIESIN: Well, we could-- Keyleth could keep her
wings and armor, and they'd be probably, possibly,

622
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:53,484
less likely to question any of us if we're walking
around with someone of reasonable stature.

623
00:34:53,537 --> 00:34:59,629
SAM: If I might remind you: for 50 minutes, now,
at this point now, right? So then we're all dead.

624
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:00,976
TALIESIN: Yeah, then we're all dead.

625
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:04,345
MARISHA: Well, we just-- It's like curfew. We have
to be home in about 50 minutes.

626
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:07,308
TRAVIS: What about you? Do you have like a magic
jock strap you can rip off and change into

627
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,447
something?

628
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:11,479
SAM: I've already done that. We're all tieflings
because of me.

629
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,696
TRAVIS: Not me, bitch.

630
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,093
SAM: You're-- abnormal.

631
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:16,215
TRAVIS: Oh. Thank you.

632
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:20,258
LIAM: Kiki, the prison that you saw, did you get
an idea for how big it is?

633
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,739
MARISHA: The what? The prison?

634
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:26,294
LIAM: The prison. That we need to break into or
get arrested and pulled into--

635
00:35:26,294 --> 00:35:35,635
MARISHA: I didn't see how big. It seemed immense,
and like it was probably pretty big underground?

636
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:38,483
But I couldn't-- can't be for sure.

637
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:42,710
TALIESIN: I would say it would be safe to assume
that a prison in hell would be so big that there

638
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:47,812
would be sayings such as 'as big as filling-- try
attempting to fill a prison in hell.' I feel like

639
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,789
this is just-- I think we're like walking into
idioms, at this point.

640
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:57,368
SAM: But if this gentleman, if I may call him a
gentleman, can escort us to the right cell block,

641
00:35:57,368 --> 00:36:05,456
or whatever, that might be very, very handy. I
don't want to spend any more time in hell than we

642
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:12,088
have to, and as much as I usually hate employees
revolting against their employer, I feel like

643
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:19,100
we've got a bird in the hand, so to speak, and we
should strike while the iron is hot, if I can use

644
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,249
many, many cliches all at once.

645
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:24,096
TALIESIN: Wait for it, wait for it.

646
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,553
ALL: Hey!

647
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:28,054
LAURA: What's going on?

648
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:29,327
TRAVIS: Hi!

649
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:30,986
LAURA: I was listening in the car!

650
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:35,726
SAM: We're about to Say Yes to the Dress, and go
and follow this plan, I think.

651
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,514
LAURA: It was the one? It was the one?!

652
00:36:37,514 --> 00:36:43,096
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you want to take the contract?
And we go kill (burps) big shit guy and go to

653
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:48,275
prison? Or do we try and, like, take a day and see
what we can find on our own, without giving

654
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:51,166
ourselves over to this-- arrangement?

655
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,653
SAM: (whispers) I don't want to walk around this
place!

656
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:57,814
LAURA: (South African accent) We're going to kill
the big guy. Oh god! I'm in South African.

657
00:36:57,814 --> 00:36:59,253
TRAVIS: Yeah, you are. Vax.

658
00:36:59,253 --> 00:37:00,493
LAURA: Ah! (babbling)

659
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:02,308
TRAVIS: What's your vote?

660
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:06,037
LIAM: Well, well, hold on, I've got one more
spitball idea. Vex?

661
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:08,253
LAURA: (accent still off) Yeah! Yes.

662
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:13,749
LIAM: That gate stone that we've used so many
times, does that only work on the material plane?

663
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:16,348
Does it work--

664
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:19,070
LAURA: Well, here's the thing, darling. I gave the
other gate stone to Scanlan.

665
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,393
LIAM: Right!

666
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:23,446
MARISHA: It won't get us out of here, no.

667
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:24,535
TALIESIN: We don't have one.

668
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,823
LIAM: Would it take us off this plane, though, or
no?

669
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:28,638
LAURA: Well, it would take one person off this
plane.

670
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:31,314
MATT: It would only take one person, and they have
to be on the same plane of existence.

671
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:33,194
LAURA: So, no, it wouldn't take anyone anywhere.

672
00:37:33,194 --> 00:37:34,946
MATT: You would know that. Based on the
enchantment.

673
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:36,702
LIAM: So that's a dead end. All right.

674
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:40,658
LAURA: Also, I heard you guys talking about the
guys with the gold armor?

675
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,497
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

676
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:42,842
LIAM: While you were standing two feet away?

677
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:44,814
LAURA: While I was standing right here, I heard
you guys talking about it?

678
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:46,038
LIAM: Yeah.

679
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:51,862
LAURA: And those guys, they're guards of the city!
Those imps in the gold armor, we were warned about

680
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:53,006
those guys!

681
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,034
MARISHA: Oh.

682
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:54,853
TRAVIS: We were?

683
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:55,616
LAURA: Yeah!

684
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:57,178
SAM: Well, why didn't you chime in before?!

685
00:37:57,178 --> 00:37:58,316
(laughter)

686
00:37:58,316 --> 00:37:59,397
TRAVIS: Yeah, fucking speak up.

687
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:01,608
LAURA: Well, I wanted to! But I was biting my
nails really hard.

688
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:07,334
MARISHA: You know, we have a day or so. Does
anyone else think that we should maybe not take

689
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:12,785
the first deal that presents itself in the first
tavern that we step into in the city? Does that

690
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:15,963
not seem super convenient?

691
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,558
TRAVIS: I mean, what are our chances of walking
around town and going like, 'hey, that prison,

692
00:38:19,696 --> 00:38:21,676
'right? Right over--'?

693
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:28,504
MARISHA: I mean-- (transforming sound) (deeper
voice) We've got about 50 minutes, if we still

694
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:29,508
want to go.

695
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:30,413
MATT: 45.

696
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:33,458
LIAM: I mean, also, if we want to get, y'know,
pinched and put into this prison, what are the

697
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:39,687
chances that we-- if we start shit here, are we
just going to get killed in the streets? Or

698
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:46,423
dragged off? It doesn't seem very solid to me, but
I don't have any other idea.

699
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:47,940
TRAVIS: All right, time for a vote!

700
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,994
SAM: I agree.

701
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,457
TRAVIS: Tary, what's your vote?

702
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:55,034
SAM: I say we take this deal, kill that employer,
and go to prison. Oh my god--

703
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:56,682
TRAVIS: Percy?

704
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:59,480
LIAM: Jeez, Tary, you've gone straight gangsta in
so little time.

705
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,558
SAM: Well, I just want to get the fuck out of here
and go back home so I can enjoy some wine!

706
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:04,675
TALIESIN: Starting to crack a bit.

707
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,795
(laughter)

708
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,115
TRAVIS: Percy, what's your vote?

709
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:08,296
TALIESIN: I vote we take the deal.

710
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:09,300
TRAVIS: Keyleth?

711
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,101
MARISHA: What?

712
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:10,889
TRAVIS: Keyleth!

713
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,734
MARISHA: I think an extra day of walking around
this city could potentially

714
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:17,433
save us years in hell that--

715
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:18,809
TRAVIS: I don't need an explanation, jesus.

716
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,368
TALIESIN: I say we take the deal at sundown.

717
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:22,053
TRAVIS: Okay. Vax?

718
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:23,056
MARISHA: We don't take the deal.

719
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:29,199
LIAM: I mean, I really don't see the harm in
spending another day here and getting the lay of

720
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,207
the land.

721
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:31,246
TRAVIS: Vex?

722
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,977
LAURA: I vote for-- For another day here.

723
00:39:33,977 --> 00:39:35,061
TALIESIN: All right.

724
00:39:35,061 --> 00:39:37,199
LAURA: But if we don't find any leads, we take
it.

725
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,394
TRAVIS: I vote for taking the contract! Me and
Tary, we're of a like mind.

726
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:42,761
TALIESIN: No, I was just swinging. I swing back.

727
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,472
SAM: What? You swing back?!

728
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:45,629
TALIESIN: I said I'd take the day.

729
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:46,668
MARISHA: He said he wants the day.

730
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:47,466
LAURA: Yeah.

731
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:48,778
TRAVIS: Bullshit. All right, we take the day.

732
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:50,030
SAM: Well, Doty hasn't voted yet.

733
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,835
LAURA: Neither has Trinket.

734
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:53,687
LIAM: What, is Doty the center that breaks the
tie?

735
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:57,024
SAM: Maybe they should arm wrestle for it.

736
00:39:57,024 --> 00:40:03,490
LAURA: Maybe they should.

737
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,639
SAM: Doty.

738
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,940
TRAVIS: Giant grizzly bear.

739
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,630
SAM: Arm wrestle that bear.

740
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,007
MATT: Turns towards you and Trinket goes-- (bear
grunting)

741
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:15,648
LAURA: Trinket's arms don't bend that way.
Trinket, you can do it.

742
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:23,840
MATT: Saunters up and looks up at Doty-- (bear
sniffing, snorts) Fogs up the metal for a second

743
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,366
on the outside--

744
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:27,127
LAURA: Wait, I haven't chosen my dice yet.

745
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,353
MATT: Choose your dice. (chuckles)

746
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:30,359
SAM: (snorts) Give her 35 minutes.

747
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,862
LAURA: Just hold on, I just need like a few--

748
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:32,984
TRAVIS: Just pick one.

749
00:40:32,984 --> 00:40:39,883
SAM: She needs a bucket of Vaseline, a feather,
preferably from a dove, and 35-40 minutes.

750
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:42,994
LAURA: Okay. Why's all my stuff in different
order?

751
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:48,829
MATT: All right, so the-- it takes roughly five or
so minutes to try and bring one of the nearby

752
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,388
tables over without burning the shit out of your
palms--

753
00:40:51,388 --> 00:40:52,369
TRAVIS: Oh right.

754
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:55,471
MATT: -- that could possibly facilitate an arm
wrestling match between a giant metal man and a

755
00:40:55,471 --> 00:40:56,779
grizzly bear.

756
00:40:56,779 --> 00:41:01,306
LAURA: Oh-- but, wait wait wait wait. Doty's not
going to get any advantage on this because he's

757
00:41:01,306 --> 00:41:03,431
been leaning against a door, right?

758
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:04,592
MATT: No, it's cooled off by now.

759
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,701
LAURA: Okay, good.

760
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:13,548
MATT: So, as it's all there, the giant metal man,
Trinket comes up--

761
00:41:13,548 --> 00:41:15,414
SAM: (whispers) Where's my Doty stats--

762
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:17,657
LAURA: Put your whole body into it, Trinket.

763
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:25,510
MATT: And Trinket, not really-- Trinket doesn't
grasp, Trinket just goes-- and just does like a

764
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,367
claw strike at his, at his hand--

765
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,298
LAURA: Yeah!

766
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:35,591
MATT: -- because that's what a bear does. And so
the giant open palm of the automaton gets slammed

767
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:39,976
by the strength of Trinket's claw and this is
going to be the, one way or another, the fastest

768
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:43,520
arm wrestling match you've ever seen. I need you
to go ahead and roll a d20 and add Trinket's

769
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,826
strength modifier.

770
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:45,826
LIAM: Come on, Trinket.

771
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:48,053
LAURA: Come on, Trinket.

772
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:49,495
LIAM: Do it.

773
00:41:49,495 --> 00:41:55,902
TALIESIN: Either way, I'm entertained. Nothing but
winners.

774
00:41:55,902 --> 00:41:57,249
LAURA: 14.

775
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:01,938
MATT: Roll a d20 and add Doty's strength
modifier.

776
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:02,731
SAM: Ten.

777
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:06,932
(laughter)

778
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:11,991
MATT: Ping! The bear's claw goes full swing,
Doty's arm gets thrust back and almost seems to

779
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,323
pop out of the socket briefly--

780
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,349
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

781
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:16,787
MATT: -- before pops it back in.

782
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:26,126
SAM: I must wage a complaint. That was not a
regulation arm-wrestling match, they did not have

783
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,007
elbows down--

784
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,984
LAURA: It's not a fair match, he doesn't have arm
joints.

785
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:36,138
SAM: It's not my fault that you didn't design your
robot-bear to have arm joints.

786
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:39,159
LAURA: He's a real bear. He's a real bear.

787
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,461
SAM: I haven't seen any evidence of that.

788
00:42:41,461 --> 00:42:47,205
LAURA: Trinket, go pee on him. Go potty, right
there.

789
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:49,885
SAM: Please don't, I rust in many places.

790
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:55,783
MATT: And this very large, looming bear just--
(aggressive bear grunting)

791
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:56,940
LAURA: Good boy.

792
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,237
MATT: -- looms up towards you. Do you do
anything?

793
00:42:59,237 --> 00:43:00,657
SAM: I don't.

794
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:02,672
(laughter)

795
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:04,764
SAM: I'm scared of the bear.

796
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:09,144
MATT: As the feeling of ever-so-slowly trickling,
warm urine soaks the right side of your armored

797
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:14,971
leg, Trinket's nose slowly brushes up against the
side of your ear and face and goes (sniffing,

798
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:22,407
grunting) (slurp) licks the side of your head and
then the last little bits of trickle end as

799
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:25,670
Trinket turns around and lumbers back towards
Vex.

800
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,896
LAURA: How's that?

801
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,943
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

802
00:43:27,943 --> 00:43:29,377
LAURA: Did that seem real enough?

803
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:32,798
MATT: Which, by the way, there's now a (sizzling)
it's starting to actually--

804
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:35,435
LAURA: Oh, that smells really awful, I'm sorry.

805
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:38,461
MARISHA: Do you have to make a point in the room
we're sleeping in?

806
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:39,637
LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

807
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:40,595
TRAVIS: This is really nice now.

808
00:43:40,595 --> 00:43:42,039
LAURA: Well, this is Grog's room anyway.

809
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,592
TALIESIN: If we're going to go outside and take a
look around, I think now is the time to do it.

810
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:46,047
TRAVIS: All right. Let's go.

811
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,689
TALIESIN: Do we want to show our friend downstairs
our ring?

812
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:52,272
MARISHA: No, we can show him later.

813
00:43:52,272 --> 00:43:53,401
TALIESIN: All right.

814
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:55,469
MATT: All right, so you guys--

815
00:43:55,469 --> 00:44:00,660
MARISHA: Do you want me to be Poppa-- (stammering
gibberish)

816
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,884
(laughter)

817
00:44:01,884 --> 00:44:02,948
MARISHA: I'm going to abandon that--

818
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:03,839
TRAVIS: Wow.

819
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,734
LAURA: How's that going for you?

820
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:05,801
TRAVIS: Eject! Eject!

821
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:07,475
SAM: (whispers) Speaking in tongues.

822
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:09,300
TALIESIN: Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

823
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,537
(laughter)

824
00:44:10,537 --> 00:44:11,666
TRAVIS: All right, she's gone.

825
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,647
MARISHA: It's been a long week.

826
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:13,910
TRAVIS: Do you want to what?

827
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,799
TALIESIN: They would never believe it if you told
them.

828
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:17,539
MARISHA: Do you want me to be the erinyes?

829
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:18,436
TRAVIS: Yeah.

830
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:19,580
MARISHA: All right.

831
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,888
TALIESIN: If you feel it start to fade we'll find
some cover and let you--

832
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:24,926
MARISHA: Do my thing.

833
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:28,537
TALIESIN: -- do your thing. I don't think, I don't
think that anybody here is necessarily against

834
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,926
duplicity, I just think they're against duplicity
against them, whomever they serve.

835
00:44:32,993 --> 00:44:36,123
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, but can you be the erinyes and
locate-- thing at the same time?

836
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:37,095
MARISHA: No.

837
00:44:37,095 --> 00:44:42,992
LAURA: Oh, but I can, I can, oh wait, I can cast
Locate Object, but not people. Does it work the

838
00:44:42,992 --> 00:44:46,759
same way? Would a Hotis egg-ball be an object?

839
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:48,646
MATT: Nope, that is specifically a creature.

840
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:51,968
LAURA: Would a prison be an object?

841
00:44:51,968 --> 00:44:55,094
MATT: Mmm, no, it's a location.

842
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:57,748
LAURA: What about the prison door outside of
Hotis' room?

843
00:44:57,748 --> 00:44:58,967
MATT: You haven't seen it.

844
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:01,623
MARISHA: Sure, I got 30 minutes left of this
9th-level spell.

845
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:03,581
TALIESIN: We'll pop it over-- pop it out if we
need.

846
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,184
TRAVIS: Yeah, what if somebody comes up to you and
like, thinks you're somebody and you're not, and

847
00:45:06,184 --> 00:45:07,896
then you gotta, like, talk.

848
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:10,841
LAURA: Well, she's her own person. It's not like
she looks like any other one.

849
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:11,516
TRAVIS: Oh.

850
00:45:11,516 --> 00:45:12,320
LAURA: Right?

851
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,402
MARISHA: I look like-- I currently look like
that.

852
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:18,001
LAURA: Hot.

853
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:19,865
TALIESIN: A 1984 metal magazine.

854
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:22,623
LIAM: I mean, she's full Mystique, she can pretty
much do it all at this point.

855
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:23,987
MARISHA: That's true, I can do it all.

856
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,046
MATT: So, what's the form you're taking?

857
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:28,547
MARISHA: He's right, I'll just take my regular
tiefling form.

858
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:29,291
MATT: Okay.

859
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,398
MARISHA: For now.

860
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:31,931
MATT: So you guys gather your things--

861
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:35,914
LAURA: But the rest of us are normal, right?
Because we don't have Alter Self anymore.

862
00:45:35,914 --> 00:45:36,797
MATT: Correct.

863
00:45:36,797 --> 00:45:38,915
TALIESIN: So if anyone asks, we belong to her.

864
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:39,892
MARISHA: Correct.

865
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:40,694
LAURA: Got it.

866
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:41,630
TRAVIS: Not me.

867
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,574
MATT: (laughs)

868
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:43,457
LAURA: Grog--

869
00:45:43,457 --> 00:45:44,581
MARISHA: For 30 minutes.

870
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:47,018
TRAVIS: All right, fine. 30. Very expensive.

871
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:52,380
MATT: All right. So, as you guys make your way
down into the main chamber, there's one more

872
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:58,346
devilish entity that's in the process of feasting
on what looks to be a small cauldron of some sort

873
00:45:58,346 --> 00:46:06,554
of broken bone and dark purple and bluish flesh,
and it's just tearing into it, as Ipkesh is at the

874
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:12,891
same table where you guys previously spoke with
him. He's sitting there with his same glass of

875
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:21,901
wine, and as you approach, he gives a nod towards
you, and he has a piece of paper on the table.

876
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:26,049
TALIESIN: Is this just to peruse?

877
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:33,488
MATT: He slides it forward. "Have a read. See if
it's up to your preferences."

878
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:37,480
SAM: May I?

879
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,766
MATT: I will give you the piece of paper,
actually.

880
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:44,787
SAM: No, let's mime it! (grunts) Coming!

881
00:46:44,787 --> 00:46:47,043
TALIESIN: I was really enjoying miming reading.

882
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:48,768
SAM: Oh my god, it's so long.

883
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:50,107
MATT: (chuckles) It's a contract!

884
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:53,203
LAURA: Oh my god! How are we-- C'mon, really?!

885
00:46:53,203 --> 00:46:54,437
SAM: Super long!

886
00:46:54,437 --> 00:47:01,692
TALIESIN: I'll be fine, I can do this. Really?
Okay, no. Okay, well, carry on, let's walk about

887
00:47:01,692 --> 00:47:07,897
while we do this. I will read out important
things-- Oh, I can't walk with this, can I? I have

888
00:47:07,897 --> 00:47:08,858
to leave this on the table.

889
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,385
MATT: No. You have to leave this here.

890
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:11,792
SAM: Just give me page two!

891
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:14,398
TRAVIS: Do you want me to give it a look?

892
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,487
MARISHA: Aw, fuck, it's long.

893
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:19,953
LAURA: Did you catch it?

894
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:21,134
TRAVIS: Buzz.

895
00:47:21,134 --> 00:47:22,791
SAM: He already signed.

896
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,965
LAURA: Can I roll my dice while they're reading a
contract?

897
00:47:24,965 --> 00:47:26,253
TRAVIS: (resigned) Sure.

898
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:32,012
LAURA: No-- No-- No-- Nope!

899
00:47:32,012 --> 00:47:35,695
TALIESIN: I can actually faff all of this. You are
an evil person.

900
00:47:35,695 --> 00:47:38,594
MARISHA: It's like the CPA mini-game of Vox
Machina!

901
00:47:38,594 --> 00:47:41,860
LIAM: I just want to update my iPhone, jesus!

902
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:48,299
MATT: Kind of, yeah. Would you like me to read the
contract out loud?

903
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,047
SAM: No!

904
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:49,793
TALIESIN: Yes!

905
00:47:49,793 --> 00:47:50,961
SAM: It's so long, Matt!

906
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:52,646
MARISHA: It's so fucking long. It's got to be at--
there's like--

907
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:55,142
SAM: We can-- well, you read too much out loud. We
will read it out loud.

908
00:47:55,142 --> 00:47:56,098
MATT: Okay.

909
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:57,041
SAM: Taliesin, take it away.

910
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,084
MARISHA: I feel like we should give this to Grog.
(laughs)

911
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,176
TALIESIN: All right. "This contract binds the
scribe and recipient into a deal--"

912
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:01,679
MATT: Hold on a second.

913
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,194
TALIESIN: "-- of chosen escalation for an unending
period of time, or this contract is voided by an

the predetermined period of eternity, allowing the

SAM: He's giving us magic!

957

MARISHA: At what cost?

958
00:51:05,393 --> 00:51:09,616
SAM: "These powers remain within your possession
until death! The recipient--" that's us,

death to the scribe to do with as they see fit."

962
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:25,885
MATT: So.

963
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:26,858
SAM: We're selling our soul!

964
00:51:26,858 --> 00:51:27,913
MATT: Not necessarily.

965
00:51:27,913 --> 00:51:34,301
MARISHA: My favorite line: "This contract as a
whole remains until the predetermined period of

966
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:37,226
"eternity." That's my favorite!

967
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:40,249
MATT: In theory, only one person has to accept the
contract.

968
00:51:40,249 --> 00:51:41,200
TALIESIN: Yes.

969
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:48,790
MATT: To lock this in, you only agree to the first
pact. And when the first pact is complete, you do

970
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:54,349
not have to trigger any of the other pacts. The
contract remains in effect. Should you ever decide

971
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:57,330
to trigger the pact, it immediately comes into
play.

972
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:06,370
SAM: So, second pact is: we get a bunch of devils,
and they get to install two in a place of divine

973
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,945
worship to be determined. Third pact is: we get
all sorts of devil magic

974
00:52:10,945 --> 00:52:12,859
in exchange for our souls.

975
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:13,663
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

976
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,121
SAM: So we're probably not going to do those
pacts-- (laughs)

977
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:16,419
LAURA: Just don't do those ones.

978
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:17,212
TRAVIS: Why?

979
00:52:17,212 --> 00:52:23,586
LIAM: So, like, we went in to buy a car, and he's
also offering us a condo and land in Florida, at

980
00:52:23,586 --> 00:52:25,261
the same time, is that about it?

981
00:52:25,261 --> 00:52:26,520
MATT: Yeah, you don't have to accept--

982
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,634
TALIESIN: In perpetuity, though.

983
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:30,723
MATT: Yeah, in perpetuity. So, you don't have to
decide now on the other pacts, but at some point

984
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,600
down the road, if you're ever in a situation where
you're like, 'oh shit, we're all about to die, I

985
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,895
'invoke the second pact,' boom, you get a bunch of
devils to help you for the next month.

986
00:52:38,895 --> 00:52:39,929
MARISHA: Wow--

987
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:46,884
And you just have to, like, say that?
You're like, 'Yo, Ipkesh, I take that second pact!'

988
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,652
MATT: You invoke the pact.

989
00:52:48,652 --> 00:52:53,572
TALIESIN: So the second pact is, we get a bunch of
stuff, but we have to do, what was it, the--

990
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,804
"agrees to introduction and installation of at
least two of--"

991
00:52:55,804 --> 00:52:59,796
SAM: We have to take two devils and put them in a
place of holy worship somewhere in the world.

992
00:52:59,796 --> 00:53:00,635
TRAVIS: Right.

993
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,463
TALIESIN: Okay. And then the third pact is our
soul.

994
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:03,259
MATT: Yes.

995
00:53:03,259 --> 00:53:05,252
TALIESIN: Our soul for somebody else's life.

996
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:08,179
LIAM: One of our souls, or all our souls?

997
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:11,017
MATT: One person has to sign the contract and only
that person's soul--

998
00:53:11,017 --> 00:53:12,415
LIAM: Oh, that's not so bad.

999
00:53:12,415 --> 00:53:13,919
LAURA: (laughs)

1000
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:17,627
TALIESIN: And the first pact, the scribe "enables
safe passage into the depths of Mentiri,

1001
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:23,532
"specifically the Bastion of Flesh, unharmed." I
feel like that's a little thin.

1002
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:27,260
MATT: Well, you're-- And you say this, in
character? (laughs)

1003
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,114
TALIESIN: (Percy voice) I feel like-- I feel like
the first pact's a little thin.

1004
00:53:30,114 --> 00:53:32,935
(laughter)

1005
00:53:32,935 --> 00:53:35,374
MATT: "Well, there is room for negotiation, of
course."

1006
00:53:35,374 --> 00:53:36,867
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1007
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:42,145
SAM: If we have some time, I could summon my
father's army of lawyers--

1008
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:45,035
TALIESIN: (chuckles) Do they have a branch here?

1009
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:50,731
SAM: No, (laughs) it would take them quite some
time to arrive. But they've negotiated tougher

1010
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:51,770
deals than this.

1011
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,091
TALIESIN: I was strangely hoping that your
father's lawyers had a branch here,

1012
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:55,366
that would be--

1013
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:56,647
LAURA: Appropriate.

1014
00:53:56,647 --> 00:54:03,244
SAM: I think they originated here, but then they
moved to where I'm from for the tax laws.

1015
00:54:03,244 --> 00:54:07,285
TALIESIN: I suppose that is a growth industry.
This is interesting, I'm going to think it over.

1016
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,571
I'm going to leave it, and we'll be back in the
evening.

1017
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:13,459
MATT: "Very well. Please, return when you have a
better idea of what you would like to see

1018
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,112
"adjusted, and I will do the same."

1019
00:54:16,112 --> 00:54:17,910
TALIESIN: I thank you for your time and patience.

1020
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,930
MATT: He takes it and rolls it up, and it vanishes
below the table as you exit.

1021
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,699
SAM: (whispers) How do we know when it's evening
here?

1022
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:24,982
LAURA: (whispers) Don't whisper here.

1023
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:27,949
SAM: Oh. Sorry. (very loudly) How do we know when
it's evening here?

1024
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:29,089
TALIESIN: Don't yell here!

1025
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:36,285
LAURA: I don't know. Can we ask him? How do we
know when it's evening here? Does it get dark?

1026
00:54:36,285 --> 00:54:39,565
MATT: "It does not get dark, there is no evening
here in Dis."

1027
00:54:39,565 --> 00:54:43,101
LAURA: Of course! (nervous laughing) Of course.

1028
00:54:43,101 --> 00:54:45,561
TALIESIN: We're going to get mugged, aren't we?
(laughs)

1029
00:54:45,561 --> 00:54:48,638
MARISHA: Mm, I mean-- I already got close!

1030
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:50,733
TALIESIN: Well, let's take a look around.

1031
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:55,138
LAURA: Does he seem to, like, notice or care that
we're not the tieflings anymore?

1032
00:54:55,138 --> 00:55:04,695
MATT: He has taken a scan of the group, but he
doesn't seem to be flinching. He is just there and

1033
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:06,247
eager to talk some more.

1034
00:55:06,247 --> 00:55:08,102
TRAVIS: It's Vegas, man. He don't give a fuck.

1035
00:55:08,102 --> 00:55:11,920
TALIESIN: I think indifference is the common
courtesy here to an awful lot.

1036
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,918
LAURA: All right.

1037
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:19,427
MATT: So, as you guys exit the establishment into
the street, the heated cobblestone still glowing a

1038
00:55:19,427 --> 00:55:26,168
dull maroon and black, you watch as what looks to
be some sort of strange mist-like form emanates

1039
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:31,690
from a crack, and turns into a screaming specter
that-- (gasping) -- and drifts further down the

1040
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:33,057
street, past you.

1041
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:35,641
LAURA: Lovely.

1042
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:37,834
SAM: They need a tourism board.

1043
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,044
(laughter)

1044
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,071
SAM: Badly.

1045
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:41,999
MATT: What do you guys wish to do?

1046
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:45,160
LAURA: What are we trying to do?

1047
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,660
SAM: I don't know!

1048
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:52,092
LAURA: We're just going to walk around and see if
we can sense where this bastion of death is.

1049
00:55:52,092 --> 00:55:54,050
MATT: You've got 25 minutes before your spell is
up.

1050
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,546
LAURA: The bastion of death is what we're trying
to find.

1051
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:57,982
MARISHA: The bastion of death is--

1052
00:55:57,982 --> 00:55:59,269
MATT: The Bastion of Flesh.

1053
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,964
MARISHA: The Bastion of Flesh is who he wants us
to kill?

1054
00:56:01,964 --> 00:56:07,829
MATT: No, the Bastion of Flesh is-- The safe
passage to the Bastion of Flesh, that is what the

1055
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:10,657
contract enables you should you fulfill your part
of the deal.

1056
00:56:10,657 --> 00:56:11,975
LAURA: So that's the prison we're looking for.

1057
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:15,941
TALIESIN: The Mentiri is the prison; that's the
part of the prison. Prison has parts.

1058
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:18,201
LIAM: Tell me-- how much time?

1059
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:19,688
TALIESIN: 25 minutes.

1060
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:23,691
LIAM: 25 minutes? What can we do in 25 minutes? We
could fast-talk a couple of people.

1061
00:56:23,691 --> 00:56:26,360
LAURA: Could I Locate Object on the Bastion of
Flesh?

1062
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,142
MATT: Not an object. It's a location.

1063
00:56:29,142 --> 00:56:31,006
TRAVIS: What about snow cones?

1064
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:32,652
LAURA: Just going to keep asking.

1065
00:56:32,652 --> 00:56:35,409
MATT: (laughs) You wouldn't be Vex if you didn't.

1066
00:56:35,409 --> 00:56:37,680
TALIESIN: 25 minutes until your spell is
dissipated, but once it is,

1067
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,248
we can do Locate Person.

1068
00:56:39,248 --> 00:56:46,747
MARISHA: Correct. I could also do Find the Path if
I have a little piece of the prison. If we could

1069
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:48,257
get a little piece of the prison--

1070
00:56:48,257 --> 00:56:49,808
LAURA: Oh. No problem!

1071
00:56:49,808 --> 00:56:50,972
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

1072
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:52,287
MARISHA: What?

1073
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:54,932
SAM: We just need a little chunk of prison lock.

1074
00:56:54,932 --> 00:56:58,806
TRAVIS: If I just had a little piece of the White
House, I could just-- (snaps)-- right to it.

1075
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:03,864
MARISHA: Hey, there are people who walk away with
pieces of forests, beaches, all the time.

1076
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:05,239
TRAVIS: They get there first, though.

1077
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:07,534
LAURA: Where do you find those people? Just
walking around?

1078
00:57:07,534 --> 00:57:10,958
MARISHA: I don't know. Does there look like an
oddities store?

1079
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:16,370
LIAM: Were there any last little bit of Hotis grit
or funk in my belly button where he shanked me?

1080
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,644
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

1081
00:57:17,644 --> 00:57:18,681
MATT: No, I mean--

1082
00:57:18,681 --> 00:57:19,694
LIAM: No?

1083
00:57:19,694 --> 00:57:24,065
MATT: Unless you guys have anything in your
possession from that battle, then no.

1084
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,183
SAM: Vex.

1085
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:26,103
LAURA: What?

1086
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:28,052
SAM: You had mentioned that you had a Locate
Object spell.

1087
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:28,850
LAURA: I do.

1088
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:35,476
SAM: Is there any object that this person we're
supposed to assassinate has that you have seen and

1089
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:36,475
know of?

1090
00:57:36,475 --> 00:57:38,497
LAURA: Oh, this person? No, I don't know anything
about--

1091
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,714
SAM: No no no, I mean the one that we came to the
Nine Hells for.

1092
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:41,591
This Hotis.

1093
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:45,415
LIAM: Hotis. I mean, he had knives, but that's the
only thing I remember.

1094
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:47,164
TALIESIN: He had a cloak, did he not?

1095
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:51,167
MARISHA: He did have a cloak, but-- I mean, last
time we saw him, he was also a--

1096
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,915
little, writhing--

1097
00:57:52,915 --> 00:57:54,384
LAURA: I did see those knives, right?

1098
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:55,523
MATT: You did, but also--

1099
00:57:55,523 --> 00:57:59,223
LIAM: Yeah, I mean he was just a-- Like a cat baby
wrapped in bacon when we saw him.

1100
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:01,007
TRAVIS: Yeah, he had a tiger-skin hoodie.

1101
00:58:01,007 --> 00:58:02,882
MARISHA: I don't know if he would still have those
items.

1102
00:58:02,882 --> 00:58:08,400
MATT: No, the objects would not reform with him.
He would reform without-- All the material

1103
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,047
possessions that Hotis had on his body when you
killed him were left behind.

1104
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:16,314
MARISHA: Does there look like there's a weird
oddities store or dealer or--

1105
00:58:16,314 --> 00:58:17,717
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1106
00:58:17,717 --> 00:58:20,101
TALIESIN: I'm also getting in on that. I'm looking
for anything of value.

1107
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:21,725
SAM: Like a costume shop?

1108
00:58:21,725 --> 00:58:23,655
MARISHA: Natural 20! Hee hee hee--

1109
00:58:23,655 --> 00:58:24,970
TALIESIN: Never mind.

1110
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:25,763
TRAVIS: Wow.

1111
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:27,161
MATT: All right.

1112
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:29,428
You don't ask around because--

1113
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:30,928
MARISHA: That's bad.

1114
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:35,730
MATT: It's a bad idea, and you start getting the
idea, too, whatever's coming down, they get the

1115
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:42,519
stink eye, and you just-- turn tough gaze and keep
walking. And eventually, you come upon a facility

1116
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:49,931
of some kind that looks to be made of almost--
pieces of black and rusted sheet metal that's

1117
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:55,753
jammed together in a very patchwork fashion. You
don't see a doorway more than you see a triangular

1118
00:58:55,753 --> 00:59:02,353
opening where the various interlocking pieces of
metal aren't fully flush. From the inside, you see

1119
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:07,493
a soft reddish-orange glow that flickers ever so
gently. As you glance inside, you see a few

1120
00:59:07,493 --> 00:59:14,122
makeshift braziers that are flickering with
reddish-orange fire and what appear to be some

1121
00:59:14,122 --> 00:59:18,178
gleaming shelves lining up strange, glowing
collections.

1122
00:59:18,178 --> 00:59:21,498
SAM: Going in?

1123
00:59:21,498 --> 00:59:23,328
TALIESIN: I want to go in.

1124
00:59:23,328 --> 00:59:26,805
MATT: Okay, as you guys enter--

1125
00:59:26,805 --> 00:59:29,134
TRAVIS: Hands in your pockets, Tary.

1126
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:30,900
SAM: I have no pockets.

1127
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,440
TRAVIS: Shit.

1128
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,926
TALIESIN: It's not Tary. We have to give him a
name.

1129
00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:35,960
SAM: Why?

1130
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,428
TALIESIN: Everyone use code names.

1131
00:59:37,428 --> 00:59:38,226
SAM: Code names?

1132
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:39,237
TRAVIS: Yrat.

1133
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:40,470
LAURA: Yrat.

1134
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,318
SAM: What?

1135
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:45,589
TRAVIS: Yrat. It's your name backwards, right?

1136
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:46,972
SAM: Oh! Okay.

1137
00:59:46,972 --> 00:59:48,130
LAURA: Whoa, Grog.

1138
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:48,873
TRAVIS: What?

1139
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:49,575
LAURA: How?

1140
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:50,637
TRAVIS: Oh, it hurts. Ow!

1141
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:51,882
(laughter)

1142
00:59:51,882 --> 00:59:53,378
TRAVIS: Ow, ow.

1143
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:54,846
MATT: You take--

1144
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:55,781
TRAVIS: Ow.

1145
00:59:55,781 --> 00:59:56,892
(laughter)

1146
00:59:56,892 --> 00:59:58,594
MATT: You take three psychic damage--

1147
00:59:58,594 --> 00:59:59,812
TRAVIS: (yells)

1148
00:59:59,812 --> 01:00:02,528
MATT: -- from attempting to think too hard.

1149
01:00:02,575 --> 01:00:06,296
LAURA: He's writing it down!

1150
01:00:06,296 --> 01:00:09,180
MARISHA: You just got punished for being too
witty!

1151
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,273
MATT: Yeah.

1152
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,392
MARISHA: It's so sad!

1153
01:00:11,392 --> 01:00:12,366
LAURA: That's amazing.

1154
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:13,157
MARISHA: Oh no.

1155
01:00:13,157 --> 01:00:14,725
MATT: Just a bit of blood trickles out of his
right ear.

1156
01:00:14,725 --> 01:00:15,924
LAURA: Oh Grog.

1157
01:00:15,924 --> 01:00:17,704
TALIESIN: That's the most you thing I have seen
happen all game.

1158
01:00:17,704 --> 01:00:20,016
MARISHA: I feel like we have to call you Yrat
now.

1159
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,245
TALIESIN: Yrat.

1160
01:00:21,245 --> 01:00:27,508
SAM: That's fine, I've been treated worse than
this--earlier today.

1161
01:00:27,508 --> 01:00:29,726
LAURA: Yeah, you got pissed on by a bear.

1162
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,261
SAM: Yeah, yeah, that's what I was talking about!

1163
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:33,225
LAURA: Who by the way-- He's back in my necklace
by the way. I don't want Trinket

1164
01:00:33,225 --> 01:00:34,253
walking around here.

1165
01:00:34,253 --> 01:00:35,775
MATT: I assumed you didn't want a giant bear
walking around.

1166
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:37,975
TALIESIN: What are we calling the two of you?

1167
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:42,003
LIAM: Wode. You can call me Wode.

1168
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:42,818
LAURA: Wode?

1169
01:00:42,818 --> 01:00:43,726
LIAM: Wode.

1170
01:00:43,726 --> 01:00:44,948
TALIESIN: That's somehow worse, all right.

1171
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:45,827
TRAVIS: What?

1172
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:47,279
LAURA: I guess I'm Wade

1173
01:00:47,279 --> 01:00:49,115
MARISHA: I'm never going to-- Wode and Wade?

1174
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:50,554
LIAM: Wode and Wade!

1175
01:00:50,554 --> 01:00:51,517
MARISHA: What the shit?

1176
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:55,761
TALIESIN: What? No Bill and Ted? All right. Wode
and Wade. My word!

1177
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:58,385
MARISHA: Wode, and Wade, Yrat--

1178
01:00:58,385 --> 01:00:59,573
TALIESIN: Freddie.

1179
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,128
MARISHA: And you can call me Minxie.

1180
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:02,367
TALIESIN: Minxie.

1181
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,487
SAM: Okay.

1182
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:04,831
LAURA: And this is Greg over here.

1183
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:05,944
MARISHA: Greg.

1184
01:01:05,944 --> 01:01:09,668
SAM: By the way, our 25 minutes is quickly ticking
down.

1185
01:01:09,668 --> 01:01:11,448
MARISHA: Well, imagine this is happening quickly,
right?

1186
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:13,372
TALIESIN: This is happening quickly as we enter
the shop. We all enter the shop.

1187
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:15,149
MATT: Well, it's taken a while to find this place
so you're about ten minutes before your spell

1188
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:20,802
ends. This is a very big city, you guys. So as you
walk-- This is the only thing you've seen so far

1189
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:26,268
that looks to have any sort of, loosely welcoming
or not, heavily guarded 'don't come in or you'll

1190
01:01:26,268 --> 01:01:31,733
get killed'-type exterior. And as you enter the
low-lit inside, you see these rickety-looking

1191
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:39,850
shelves that contain small glowing gems or
crystals of different colors and sizes. Like

1192
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:46,864
weird geodes that are cut from natural deposits.
And across the way, there is just a stool and what

1193
01:01:46,864 --> 01:01:51,649
looks to be some sort of humanoid creature that is
slumped forward and breathing heavily. With these

1194
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:59,069
elongated, dull green color on the skin, a series
of small spines that protrude from the shoulders

1195
01:01:59,069 --> 01:02:00,242
and back--

1196
01:02:00,242 --> 01:02:01,441
SAM: Spines?

1197
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:09,106
MATT: Yeah, like jagged, long, thin spines. And as
you enter inside, it turns up and goes,

1198
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:10,848
SAM: Wait!

1199
01:02:11,046 --> 01:02:12,011
MATT: "Yes?"

1200
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,731
SAM: We don't have a code name for him!

1201
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:14,636
LAURA: Yeah, Freddie.

1202
01:02:14,636 --> 01:02:15,832
SAM: Oh, Freddie, okay.

1203
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,378
TRAVIS: Bidet.

1204
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:21,566
MATT: "You come to buy pretties?"

1205
01:02:21,566 --> 01:02:23,070
TRAVIS: Yeah, yes!

1206
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,456
SAM: No! What?

1207
01:02:25,456 --> 01:02:29,288
MARISHA: Thing is-- I'm looking for something
specific.

1208
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:31,925
MATT: What do you seek?

1209
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:38,685
MARISHA: Do you have any pieces or remnants or
items from the Mentiri Prison? Specifically from

1210
01:02:38,893 --> 01:02:41,526
the Bastion of Flesh?

1211
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:45,935
MATT: "No, no, I do not go there."

1212
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:48,469
MARISHA: Why not?

1213
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:55,146
MATT: "Because it is for fleshy types." And he
nudges this long, jagged chin; these gnashing

1214
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:00,579
teeth that are crooked and overlapping as it spits
as it speaks in your direction.

1215
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:02,048
TALIESIN: Charming.

1216
01:03:02,048 --> 01:03:05,853
MARISHA: Where is it located? We need in.

1217
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:08,149
MATT: "What?"

1218
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:16,449
MARISHA: And then I slowly start to Shapechange
just for the erinyes face, and I give just a flash

1219
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:25,431
of it. We need in. And you're going to help me,
aren't you?

1220
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:27,929
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.

1221
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,341
MARISHA: Fucking hell.

1222
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:30,410
MATT: Literally.

1223
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,213
LAURA: Yeah!

1224
01:03:31,213 --> 01:03:32,748
MARISHA: Fucking hell.

1225
01:03:32,748 --> 01:03:36,491
LAURA: What is it? What is it?

1226
01:03:36,491 --> 01:03:39,047
MARISHA: It's a 19! But it was almost bad!

1227
01:03:39,047 --> 01:03:41,958
LAURA: Plus seven.

1228
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,839
MARISHA: Plus seven, so 26.

1229
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:53,570
MATT: "I do not know the-- the nature of this city
is to be rebuilt. Always rebuilt, aways changing.

1230
01:03:53,570 --> 01:04:04,742
"The archdevil, he worries. He's paranoid.
Everything must not be the same as it was. I know

1231
01:04:04,742 --> 01:04:08,589
"not where it is, I know not where the Bastion is,
I'm sorry!"

1232
01:04:08,589 --> 01:04:11,760
MARISHA: Well then, how do people get around the
city? You know.

1233
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,781
MATT: "Those who work, those who are within, those
who are under the guidance of the prison's

1234
01:04:16,781 --> 01:04:20,317
"masters. They know. They know."

1235
01:04:20,317 --> 01:04:21,885
MARISHA: Where do I find them?

1236
01:04:21,885 --> 01:04:23,387
LAURA: (whispers) The ring!

1237
01:04:23,387 --> 01:04:25,329
MARISHA: And I show them the ring of Asmodeus.

1238
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,385
SAM: You don't have it.

1239
01:04:26,385 --> 01:04:27,420
LAURA: (whispers) No, but she does.

1240
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,639
SAM: Oh. But she doesn't?

1241
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:29,646
TRAVIS: I do.

1242
01:04:29,646 --> 01:04:30,558
MARISHA: He has it.

1243
01:04:30,558 --> 01:04:32,443
LAURA: Oh. I dunno who has it. The ring!

1244
01:04:32,443 --> 01:04:34,205
MATT: It's on his pinkie.

1245
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:38,236
SAM: He went to Jared!

1246
01:04:38,236 --> 01:04:40,904
MARISHA: (high-pitched singing) It can only be
Jared!

1247
01:04:40,904 --> 01:04:41,925
TALIESIN: Jared!

1248
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:51,149
MATT: "I can not help! I don't know." And he just
lowers his head in a shameful worrying. You can

1249
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:53,866
see his knees are quivering ever-so-gently.

1250
01:04:53,866 --> 01:04:57,478
LAURA: I want to insight check him to see if he
looks like he's--

1251
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:58,938
MATT: Make an insight check.

1252
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:02,533
LAURA: I feel like he is but I just want to make
sure.

1253
01:05:02,533 --> 01:05:05,229
TRAVIS: That's good.

1254
01:05:05,229 --> 01:05:07,880
LAURA: 26 there.

1255
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:14,150
MATT: Okay, legitimately, this creature is pretty
pathetic as far as devils go that you've come

1256
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:20,616
across, and in the threatening presence of an
erinyes that is asking for information it does not

1257
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:26,198
seem to have, it is legitimately awaiting a
terrible demotion that it doesn't feel it earned.

1258
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:30,270
LAURA: Mistress, I don't believe he knows.

1259
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:35,634
MARISHA: I need a name and location of where to
find the information that I need.

1260
01:05:35,634 --> 01:05:40,776
MATT: "I don't know, I don't know."

1261
01:05:40,776 --> 01:05:43,896
MARISHA: Then who does?

1262
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:55,292
MATT: You see him looking around, spastically, his
eyes are shooting around the room at all of you

1263
01:05:55,362 --> 01:06:00,125
and around looking at the geodes at different
directions almost like a weird iguana face. He

1264
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:05,171
says, "The torturers, the chains."

1265
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:07,410
LAURA: Oh shit.

1266
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:17,730
MARISHA: God damn it-- the chain devils. All
right.

1267
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:19,245
TRAVIS: I mean, we're in here.

1268
01:06:19,245 --> 01:06:24,244
TALIESIN: I think we should allow this poor
creature an attempt to redeem himself, what is it

1269
01:06:24,244 --> 01:06:27,797
that you sell here that would please our
mistress?

1270
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:36,943
MATT: "I sell pretties, I sell pretties, pretties
used for rites, used for magic"

1271
01:06:36,943 --> 01:06:39,207
TALIESIN: Please, impress us.

1272
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:45,844
MATT: He stands up now, and this creature that
looked so pathetic when it was squatting down on

1273
01:06:45,844 --> 01:06:53,233
this stool, these long thin gollum-like legs, it
stands up and is now head-height, a good foot over

1274
01:06:53,233 --> 01:06:58,869
most of the party-- Gangly, the spines extending
from the back of the head and the arms and the

1275
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:06,441
elbows as it stands up now. As it slowly stalks
over to one of the shelves and pulls off one of

1276
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:10,263
these strange purple geodes, the various crystals
jutting out of different sides, and it turns

1277
01:07:10,263 --> 01:07:22,777
around and brings it forward. "This, this carries
pure condensed soul energy, geodes robbed her from

1278
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:28,346
"the fourth layer." As he takes it and holds it in
front towards you, you look inside and you swear

1279
01:07:28,346 --> 01:07:36,686
within the slight glimmers of light that shake
through from the nearby braziers you see almost

1280
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:42,279
dozens of faces pressed up against the crystalline
interior, shifting past, similar to that giant

1281
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:47,588
sphere, that orb you saw being passed through the
city when you first arrived.

1282
01:07:47,588 --> 01:07:51,322
LIAM: This is insulting! Skip the small stuff,
what have you got?

1283
01:07:51,322 --> 01:07:53,850
MATT: "This is what I have got."

1284
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:58,092
LIAM: That's it?

1285
01:07:58,092 --> 01:08:07,040
MATT: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." He looks to you and
looks back. "Mistress, I'm, I have-- this."

1286
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,373
SAM: Mistress, would you like one?

1287
01:08:11,373 --> 01:08:17,598
TALIESIN: What do you have that's unique?
Expensive is lovely, don't get us wrong, but we're

1288
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:20,497
looking for unique, odd.

1289
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:24,602
MARISHA: Yes, I had one of those for breakfast.

1290
01:08:24,602 --> 01:08:30,926
TALIESIN: So proud of you right now.

1291
01:08:30,926 --> 01:08:36,245
MATT: It lumbers over to this far corner and
there's a pile of what looks like burlap and

1292
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:43,784
refuse and partially eaten partially rotting away
chunks of flesh, and just rummaging through them,

1293
01:08:43,784 --> 01:08:53,803
looking over the shoulder with a scattered look,
and pulls up what looks to be a long-decomposed

1294
01:08:53,803 --> 01:08:59,103
and somewhat mummified humanoid arm. The fingers
are kind of locked up in this way, and there's a

1295
01:08:59,103 --> 01:09:02,878
small brass bracelet around the center of the
wrist.

1296
01:09:02,878 --> 01:09:05,680
LIAM: Now you have our attention.

1297
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,810
MATT: He shakes it and you hear it rattling.

1298
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,339
LIAM: What can you tell us about that?

1299
01:09:09,339 --> 01:09:13,101
MATT: You can hear it rattling against the bones
and as it shakes, one of the fingers snaps off

1300
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:20,472
with a poof of dust and hits the ground, "Oh!
Sorry." He picks it up and tries to put it back on

1301
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:22,121
but it won't go back on.

1302
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:25,998
(sounds of disgust)

1303
01:09:25,998 --> 01:09:36,475
MARISHA: I snatch it from him. Yrat, do the
thing.

1304
01:09:36,475 --> 01:09:40,491
SAM: I ritually cast Identify on the bracelet.

1305
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:51,936
MATT: Okay. The bracelet essentially acts as a
divination beacon. It's attuned to a secondary

1306
01:09:51,936 --> 01:09:58,819
device that can keep watch on this one. Apparently
whoever previously wore this was doing so under

1307
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:04,911
the intent of relaying their travel or experience
to somewhere else, and then

1308
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:06,794
met a very terrible end.

1309
01:10:06,794 --> 01:10:08,783
SAM: Oh, so it's useless to us.

1310
01:10:08,783 --> 01:10:12,577
MATT: Maybe. Not everything you encounter is going
to be useful, guys!

1311
01:10:12,577 --> 01:10:14,163
SAM: Yeah no, that's fine, that's fine.

1312
01:10:14,163 --> 01:10:18,356
MARISHA: Well, it's to relay information back to
whoever's wearing it? Or to him specifically?

1313
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:20,811
MATT: To whoever has the other object that's
paired with this that

1314
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:22,175
you don't know what that is.

1315
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:23,863
TALIESIN: We found a single walkie-talkie.

1316
01:10:23,863 --> 01:10:24,949
LAURA: Right, yeah.

1317
01:10:24,949 --> 01:10:25,922
MATT: Essentially.

1318
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,749
LIAM: Tary, is that thing working right now?

1319
01:10:27,749 --> 01:10:30,530
TALIESIN: Is it working right now?

1320
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,121
SAM: I -- Detect Magic on it? Is it--

1321
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:35,099
MATT: It is magical, it is functional.

1322
01:10:35,099 --> 01:10:38,012
SAM: As far as I know, someone is watching this
right now.

1323
01:10:38,012 --> 01:10:41,530
MATT: You don't know how old it is or how long
it's been there, but it is magical.

1324
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:46,346
SAM: Mistress, would you like this?

1325
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:50,364
MARISHA: We'll take it for good measure.

1326
01:10:50,364 --> 01:10:51,412
SAM: Oh, really.

1327
01:10:51,412 --> 01:10:52,288
MARISHA: I guess?

1328
01:10:52,288 --> 01:10:53,513
SAM: Okay, sure.

1329
01:10:53,513 --> 01:10:55,978
SAM: How much would you like for this? What do
they--

1330
01:10:55,978 --> 01:10:58,754
MARISHA: I just want this as a souvenir for our
visit.

1331
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,429
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just want the one walkie talkie
that doesn't have a pair.

1332
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:06,250
MARISHA: I'm not going to pay for it. You're not
going to sell this; I want it. Right?

1333
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:15,366
MATT: You can see the brow furrow, and there's a
moment of instinctual anger and frustration, like

1334
01:11:15,366 --> 01:11:22,712
a kid who had his lunch money taken, but he's
still like (angry breathing), goes and sits down

1335
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:27,497
on the stool once more, the long knobby knees
almost jesting up to shoulder height as it sits,

1336
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:33,368
its arms draped over the front, and the fingers
dragging across the ground in front as it does, as

1337
01:11:33,368 --> 01:11:35,720
it looks up, "Take it."

1338
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:45,862
MARISHA: I lean forward and I take my erinyes nail
and I go around his face, and I say, consider

1339
01:11:45,978 --> 01:11:48,242
this a good-faith investment.

1340
01:11:48,242 --> 01:11:50,305
MATT: "Yes, yes."

1341
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:58,655
MARISHA: You will be seeing us again. And I take
out 20 gold. 20 gold.

1342
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:05,931
MATT: He takes it and goes: "I will be a favor to
the mistress."

1343
01:12:05,931 --> 01:12:11,561
TALIESIN: We hear you utter our description to
anyone, and you will never see anything again.

1344
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,226
MATT: "No, no, no."

1345
01:12:13,226 --> 01:12:15,812
TRAVIS: Don't we want the purple gobstopper?

1346
01:12:15,812 --> 01:12:16,896
TALIESIN AND LAURA: No, no.

1347
01:12:16,896 --> 01:12:17,706
TRAVIS: Why?

1348
01:12:17,706 --> 01:12:18,703
TALIESIN: We've got plenty.

1349
01:12:18,703 --> 01:12:20,451
TRAVIS: That's coin around here, though. We might
need it.

1350
01:12:20,451 --> 01:12:21,945
SAM: Sure.

1351
01:12:21,945 --> 01:12:25,555
MATT: His hands clasp together, overlapping in
front of him. He's looking up at you with this new

1352
01:12:25,555 --> 01:12:31,129
grin, almost like, now there's been a moment of
acceptance or a moment of some sort of, in his

1353
01:12:31,129 --> 01:12:33,709
eyes, a union.

1354
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:43,286
MARISHA: If you minions would like to buy the
purple stone with your allowance--

1355
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:44,964
TRAVIS: Oh, motherfucker.

1356
01:12:44,964 --> 01:12:49,759
MARISHA: -- the mistress grants you, you may.

1357
01:12:49,759 --> 01:12:51,150
TRAVIS: How much for the pretty?

1358
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,363
LAURA: Thanks so much, mistress.

1359
01:12:52,363 --> 01:12:54,027
TALIESIN: Perhaps you would like to shift back to
your normal form.

1360
01:12:54,027 --> 01:12:59,074
MARISHA: You're welcome, young Wade.

1361
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:06,015
MATT: The creature's looking very confused, but
nevertheless eager to listen.

1362
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:10,807
"For the purple stone --"

1363
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,041
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

1364
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:20,916
MATT: "1500 gold pieces."

1365
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:23,929
TALIESIN: That number does not please the
mistress, I don't think. Does it?

1366
01:13:23,929 --> 01:13:26,933
SAM: Here you go. 1500 gold.

1367
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:29,311
MATT: As you throw the sack there is a--

1368
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:30,250
TALIESIN: Wow.

1369
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:38,880
MATT: (grunts) And sets it down next to it, stands
up, grabs and takes the geode off the shelf and

1370
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,156
hands it to you.

1371
01:13:40,156 --> 01:13:41,332
SAM: Thank you.

1372
01:13:41,332 --> 01:13:43,667
MATT: "Mistress is pleased, yes?"

1373
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:48,335
MARISHA: Very. Keep it that way.

1374
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:49,621
MATT: "Yes."

1375
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:58,781
MARISHA: All right. Roll out.

1376
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:12,542
(laughter)

1377
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:14,045
TRAVIS: Autobots--

1378
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:15,308
ALL: Roll out.

1379
01:14:15,308 --> 01:14:17,504
MARISHA: It was taking everything to not say
"Autobots!"

1380
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:22,577
MATT: All right. As you guys step out of the
facility into the center of town, you sense the

1381
01:14:22,577 --> 01:14:25,801
final moments of your Shapechange spell--

1382
01:14:25,801 --> 01:14:26,649
LAURA: Oh.

1383
01:14:26,649 --> 01:14:27,585
MATT: -- beginning to dissipate.

1384
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:28,722
MARISHA: And I kind of want to--

1385
01:14:28,722 --> 01:14:35,660
LIAM: Okay, before we leave, I want to hang back
just for a sec, and, hey, Slenderman. You seem a

1386
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:39,632
nervous type. You keep to yourself, do you?

1387
01:14:39,632 --> 01:14:40,745
MATT: "Maybe."

1388
01:14:40,745 --> 01:14:45,868
LIAM: Where would you not go, to stay out from
under the noses of your betters?

1389
01:14:45,868 --> 01:14:50,783
MATT: "I don't understand."

1390
01:14:50,783 --> 01:14:57,150
LIAM: You hide in your shop. Where do you avoid so
you don't get stepped on?

1391
01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:02,673
MATT: He leans out of the door with you and points
towards the iron tower.

1392
01:15:02,673 --> 01:15:05,248
LIAM: Thanks.

1393
01:15:05,248 --> 01:15:11,404
MATT: As you're about to leave, he grabs the back
of your cloak and pulls you in, points past your

1394
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:19,626
shoulders, his long jagged curved claw, and you
notice as two more of these flying entities that

1395
01:15:19,626 --> 01:15:25,355
scoot by, one of them perching on a building
across the way, wearing the golden armor, stop and,

1396
01:15:25,463 --> 01:15:30,381
"The Whisperers." And then pushes you back out of
the street and you hear the shifting of metal

1397
01:15:30,381 --> 01:15:35,200
behind you, as a large slab is shifted to close
the front of the shop.

1398
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,084
MARISHA: I use Alter Self to go to my tiefling
form.

1399
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:39,118
MATT: All right.

1400
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:43,724
LAURA: I want to keep an eye out for all of those
imps in gold.

1401
01:15:43,724 --> 01:15:45,848
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

1402
01:15:45,848 --> 01:15:47,890
LIAM: Same.

1403
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:53,379
LAURA: 24.

1404
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:54,578
MATT: 24, Okay--

1405
01:15:54,578 --> 01:15:55,424
LIAM: 30.

1406
01:15:55,424 --> 01:15:56,349
LAURA: Whoa.

1407
01:15:56,349 --> 01:16:02,222
MATT: Okay! Between the two of you, looking up,
there are-- at the peripheral of your vision and

1408
01:16:02,222 --> 01:16:06,751
the bits of the green ash clouds that make up the
sky as the occasional flashes of lightning streak

1409
01:16:06,751 --> 01:16:12,151
through it from within, you see the shadows of
hundreds of flying entities that seem to be just

1410
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:16,949
running paths, keeping watch, many just stop and
perch for a moment, glancing over the street, and

1411
01:16:16,949 --> 01:16:23,086
then take off again. Many of them wearing the same
gold armor, these Whisperers appear to be

1412
01:16:23,086 --> 01:16:26,392
everywhere and watching everyone. There is --

1413
01:16:26,392 --> 01:16:28,841
LAURA: But they're not paying us special attention
at all.

1414
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:34,734
MATT: There are a handful that seem to be
genuinely interested in keeping an eye on you, but

1415
01:16:34,734 --> 01:16:38,410
you also see other ones that are genuinely keeping
an eye on anyone else wandering the street.

1416
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:39,332
LAURA: Okay.

1417
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:42,891
LIAM: So the man on top has cast a wide net over
this city?

1418
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:44,416
MATT: It seems that way, yes.

1419
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:46,772
LIAM: There's no way we're unseen. Yeah.

1420
01:16:46,772 --> 01:16:52,423
MARISHA: As we start-- are we walking back towards
the tavern? As we walk, I--

1421
01:16:52,423 --> 01:16:55,514
TALIESIN: Take a slightly different route back,
just to try and see more.

1422
01:16:55,514 --> 01:16:56,298
MATT: Okay.

1423
01:16:56,298 --> 01:16:57,272
LAURA: Yeah.

1424
01:16:57,272 --> 01:17:07,447
MARISHA: So it seems one of the lesser devils who
is interested in Vax might be our ticket in.

1425
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:09,582
LAURA: The chain guys.

1426
01:17:09,582 --> 01:17:11,431
MARISHA: The chain guys.

1427
01:17:11,431 --> 01:17:13,891
TALIESIN: Can you scry him, since you've seen him
before?

1428
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:15,947
LIAM: That's a good idea.

1429
01:17:15,947 --> 01:17:17,786
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess I could.

1430
01:17:17,786 --> 01:17:20,434
TALIESIN: Let's scry ourselves a chain devil.

1431
01:17:20,434 --> 01:17:30,671
MARISHA: I'm wondering if worst-case scenario we
could always use you as bait, Vax?

1432
01:17:30,671 --> 01:17:33,467
LAURA: Wode.

1433
01:17:33,467 --> 01:17:35,143
MARISHA: Sorry, Wode.

1434
01:17:35,143 --> 01:17:36,436
TALIESIN: Wode.

1435
01:17:36,436 --> 01:17:38,317
LIAM: Thanks, Wade.

1436
01:17:38,317 --> 01:17:42,791
TALIESIN: It's cool, brah.

1437
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,117
MARISHA: Party on, Wode.

1438
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:48,711
TALIESIN: Party on, Wade. Let's scry!

1439
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:53,001
MARISHA: We get back. Okay, we gotta get back to
the tavern. Back to the tavern?

1440
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,742
MATT: Yeah, it's a ritual, you'd have to set up
for it.

1441
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:58,401
All right. So you head back, and you're
scrying on the chain devil you saw before? Okay.

1442
01:17:58,606 --> 01:18:01,603
GROG: Any chance he'll see you do it then?

1443
01:18:01,603 --> 01:18:03,155
LAURA: I know, is he going to know?

1444
01:18:03,155 --> 01:18:04,644
TALIESIN: Yeah, who cares.

1445
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:07,493
TRAVIS: Oh, now we're carefree! Oh good, I love
it!

1446
01:18:07,493 --> 01:18:11,818
MARISHA: Well, to be fair, I feel like these
people are used to being watched.

1447
01:18:11,818 --> 01:18:12,834
LAURA: That's true.

1448
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:15,403
MATT: All right, what's your spell DC?

1449
01:18:15,403 --> 01:18:16,950
MARISHA: 20.

1450
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:39,990
MATT: All righty. Actually, it pulls from here--
it's going to be a wisdom save-- hmm, okay. Hmm.

1451
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:47,646
You finish the ritual, and as you focus, there's a
flash of red-hot energy in your eyes, and then the

1452
01:18:47,646 --> 01:18:49,720
spell comes to an end.

1453
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:54,669
LAURA: Is he like Hotis?

1454
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:57,557
LIAM: Did you zero in?

1455
01:18:57,557 --> 01:19:02,909
MARISHA: I hate it when that happens! It's like a
flashbulb going off in your eye!

1456
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:04,367
LAURA: Could you do it at a higher level?

1457
01:19:04,367 --> 01:19:08,616
MARISHA: Ugh, bastards! Oh, Christ! I can't,
that's it, that's all I got for the day.

1458
01:19:08,616 --> 01:19:10,990
That's it.

1459
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:12,597
TRAVIS: So, nothing?

1460
01:19:12,597 --> 01:19:14,353
MARISHA: I got 4th-level spells and lower.

1461
01:19:14,353 --> 01:19:15,134
LAURA: Balls.

1462
01:19:15,134 --> 01:19:21,046
TALIESIN: What is the Vassalage? That is a good
question. Shit.

1463
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:23,593
LAURA: Welp.

1464
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,481
TRAVIS: Are they up in-- We went up to the room,
right?

1465
01:19:25,481 --> 01:19:26,620
LAURA: Yeah.

1466
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:29,025
TRAVIS: Does anybody want to try the meat stuff
downstairs?

1467
01:19:29,025 --> 01:19:29,783
LAURA: No!

1468
01:19:29,783 --> 01:19:30,615
TALIESIN: No.

1469
01:19:30,615 --> 01:19:31,827
TRAVIS: Why?

1470
01:19:31,827 --> 01:19:34,188
LAURA: I feel like it's human remains, I don't
know.

1471
01:19:34,188 --> 01:19:35,820
TRAVIS: But you don't know.

1472
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,721
LAURA: It doesn't look appealing to me, Grog.

1473
01:19:37,721 --> 01:19:39,872
TALIESIN: I have a very active imagination when I
eat.

1474
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:41,686
TRAVIS: I don't. I'll be right back. I go
downstairs.

1475
01:19:41,686 --> 01:19:44,203
MATT: Okay. You head downstairs--

1476
01:19:44,203 --> 01:19:47,989
LIAM: I'm going to accompany Grog, yeah.

1477
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:53,517
MATT: Okay. As the two of you head down, you can
see-- There's that one central table to the left

1478
01:19:53,517 --> 01:19:58,934
western side of the room that has almost like a
trough look to it, with the jagged edges?

1479
01:19:58,934 --> 01:20:00,058
TRAVIS: Yup.

1480
01:20:00,058 --> 01:20:04,715
MATT: Currently has four imps that are perched on
the edge that are just tearing into bits, tearing

1481
01:20:04,715 --> 01:20:09,370
it off and chewing and they all stop and look up
at you, all four at once, as you walk down and

1482
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:12,857
they all just slowly chew as you approach and walk
into the chamber.

1483
01:20:12,857 --> 01:20:14,975
TRAVIS: Are they wearing armor and shit?

1484
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:15,912
MATT: No.

1485
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:16,952
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

1486
01:20:16,952 --> 01:20:20,739
MATT: They are not wearing armor. Ipkesh is
present, but not at the same table he was earlier.

1487
01:20:20,739 --> 01:20:24,498
He's currently at the bar area talking with his
rotund barkeep.

1488
01:20:24,498 --> 01:20:33,946
TRAVIS: Hey, that stuff, right, that normal people
have. Can I have like, a little plate of it?

1489
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:44,705
MATT: The thick, greasy guy sits, goes, "Oh,
yeah." He looks over to Ipkesh-- Winks at you.

1490
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:46,320
"On the house."

1491
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,603
TRAVIS: Oh, that's very kind of you. See? Look,
experimenting with new cultures is really quite

1492
01:20:50,603 --> 01:20:55,034
nice. New tastes and all. What does it look like?

1493
01:20:55,034 --> 01:21:04,287
MATT: It looks like-- You know steak tartare where
it has that purplish-red color to it?

1494
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:05,583
TRAVIS: Very red.

1495
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:10,941
MATT: Imagine that, but there's a series of jagged
bone shards sticking out at sections of it, like

1496
01:21:10,941 --> 01:21:14,045
whatever it was carved off of had been pulverized
before it was butchered.

1497
01:21:14,045 --> 01:21:16,238
TRAVIS: Mm. Tenderized.

1498
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:24,319
MATT: Yes. But with the bone still present within.
And it is seeping this sludge-like, bloody fluid

1499
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:28,180
that is just pooled around it on this iron
platter.

1500
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,522
TRAVIS: Wode, would you want any of this?

1501
01:21:30,522 --> 01:21:37,232
LIAM: "You know, I'm going to watch-- You go
first." And I put my hand on his arm and say,

1502
01:21:37,232 --> 01:21:42,072
"Let's just see how you do." And I don't take my
hand off.

1503
01:21:42,072 --> 01:21:43,255
MATT: Okay.

1504
01:21:43,255 --> 01:21:50,137
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll take one of the little bones
out, and I spoon together like, a good chunk like

1505
01:21:50,137 --> 01:21:54,436
spaghetti on a fork. And I pop it right in.

1506
01:21:54,436 --> 01:21:56,123
MATT: Okay. Well, there are no utensils.

1507
01:21:56,123 --> 01:21:58,083
TRAVIS: No, no, I'm using the bone as the
utensil.

1508
01:21:58,236 --> 01:22:03,702
MATT: Using the bone as the utensil, okay. As you
spool it up, pop it in and chew, it's-- it's very

1509
01:22:03,702 --> 01:22:10,926
gamey. It's warm. But the flavor, it's-- it's
very iron-like.

1510
01:22:11,136 --> 01:22:14,706
TRAVIS: Like chewing on pennies.

1511
01:22:14,706 --> 01:22:20,652
MATT: Kind of, yeah, and a similar texture. The
bones do tear into parts of your upper lip.

1512
01:22:20,652 --> 01:22:21,607
TRAVIS: Ah.

1513
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:22,947
MATT: It hurts.

1514
01:22:22,947 --> 01:22:24,116
TRAVIS: Ah.

1515
01:22:24,116 --> 01:22:29,733
MATT: I'd say, in the process of devouring this
one bite, you do suffer-- You suffer two points of

1516
01:22:29,733 --> 01:22:30,948
piercing damage.

1517
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:32,051
TRAVIS: Fucking hell.

1518
01:22:32,051 --> 01:22:34,204
LAURA: Little by little, Grog.

1519
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:35,502
MARISHA: It's the little things.

1520
01:22:35,502 --> 01:22:42,314
MATT: As you're chewing-- Vax, you watch Grog
squinting his eyes a bit and chewing as bits of

1521
01:22:42,314 --> 01:22:47,012
blood begin to dribble down the sides of his chin,
but a bright red color, not the color of the meat

1522
01:22:47,012 --> 01:22:48,966
that he's eating.

1523
01:22:48,966 --> 01:22:50,159
LIAM: Hey.

1524
01:22:50,207 --> 01:22:54,575
TRAVIS: Do I feel high? Like Freddie did when he
consumed the little orb of-- ?

1525
01:22:54,575 --> 01:23:03,828
MATT: No, you do not. You chew it, you swallow it,
it hurts and grinds its way down, hits your

1526
01:23:03,828 --> 01:23:07,676
stomach. There is a slight numbness to the inside
as you eat it.

1527
01:23:07,676 --> 01:23:08,673
TRAVIS: Hey!

1528
01:23:08,673 --> 01:23:10,976
MATT: But that's the most you get.

1529
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,659
LIAM: You all right? You feeling all right?

1530
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:17,374
TRAVIS: Yeah, it really fights back as you eat it.
You know?

1531
01:23:17,374 --> 01:23:19,615
LIAM: What's the aftertaste like?

1532
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:24,675
TRAVIS: It kind of tastes like if you took a bunch
of rusty nails and then shoved them in your thumb

1533
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:26,694
and then sucked on that for a while.

1534
01:23:26,694 --> 01:23:27,933
LIAM: Huh.

1535
01:23:27,933 --> 01:23:28,778
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1536
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:30,099
MARISHA: That was-- very specific.

1537
01:23:30,099 --> 01:23:31,663
TRAVIS: Have you done that before?

1538
01:23:31,663 --> 01:23:33,444
MARISHA: No, but I feel like you have.

1539
01:23:33,444 --> 01:23:34,831
TRAVIS: Have you not?

1540
01:23:34,831 --> 01:23:37,071
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

1541
01:23:37,071 --> 01:23:40,405
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah. I have another bite.

1542
01:23:40,405 --> 01:23:47,941
MATT: All right. You, bite by bite, begin to
finish the meal. I'd say, for the remainder of it,

1543
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:49,742
you suffer another three points of piercing
damage, but you do

1544
01:23:49,742 --> 01:23:51,991
finish the flesh in front of you.

1545
01:23:51,991 --> 01:23:54,753
TRAVIS: My plate of flesh.

1546
01:23:54,753 --> 01:23:58,946
LIAM: He legitimately seems fine? He's all right,
he's not like-- veins aren't popping out,

1547
01:23:58,946 --> 01:24:01,022
nothing amiss?

1548
01:24:01,022 --> 01:24:01,701
MATT: Nope.

1549
01:24:01,701 --> 01:24:03,305
LIAM: All right.

1550
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:06,033
TRAVIS: My compliments to the chef.

1551
01:24:06,033 --> 01:24:17,948
MATT: His already somewhat greasy, ruddy cheeks go
to a blushing smile. "Thank you."

1552
01:24:18,155 --> 01:24:23,397
TRAVIS: That tasted like forearm. Okay, I'm good.
Wode, do you want

1553
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:25,641
to go back up-- (hiccups) -- stairs?

1554
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:28,735
LIAM: "Yeah." I grab a small, just a small piece
and put it in my mouth,

1555
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:31,099
and I spit it out immediately.

1556
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:31,956
MATT: Yeah.

1557
01:24:31,956 --> 01:24:32,869
LIAM: Immediately.

1558
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:33,903
MATT: It's pretty awful.

1559
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:34,638
LIAM: Yeah.

1560
01:24:34,638 --> 01:24:35,580
LAURA: Is it salty?

1561
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:39,818
TRAVIS: It's not for everyone, yeah. Cook is right
there, literally. Sorry.

1562
01:24:39,818 --> 01:24:41,479
LIAM: Hah, yeah. Let's go back up.

1563
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:42,213
TRAVIS: Okay.

1564
01:24:42,213 --> 01:24:44,377
MATT: All right. You guys head back up. So what's
everyone doing?

1565
01:24:44,377 --> 01:24:47,922
LAURA: Jeez. Well, I feel like we're not getting
very far in the city.

1566
01:24:47,922 --> 01:24:49,799
LIAM: Yeah, we're kind of eatin' it in here.

1567
01:24:49,799 --> 01:24:51,727
TALIESIN: I say we take the contract.

1568
01:24:51,727 --> 01:24:52,905
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah!

1569
01:24:52,905 --> 01:24:57,694
SAM: I hate to say, "I told you so--"

1570
01:24:57,694 --> 01:25:01,795
TALIESIN: I'll take the contract.

1571
01:25:01,795 --> 01:25:02,649
SAM: No.

1572
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:03,753
MARISHA: What? Percy--

1573
01:25:03,753 --> 01:25:05,348
LAURA: Percy, you're not taking this contract.

1574
01:25:05,348 --> 01:25:11,521
TALIESIN: I'm the one who's already touched by
demonic forces. I think I can resist the

1575
01:25:11,521 --> 01:25:14,152
temptations of the second and third pact.

1576
01:25:14,152 --> 01:25:15,485
TRAVIS: Cool.

1577
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:23,598
TALIESIN: And I think I know what to add to this.
I think we need to demand a guide, and I think we

1578
01:25:23,598 --> 01:25:32,824
need to demand safe passage out of the prison, as
well, and back to our original

1579
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:35,775
plane as best he can.

1580
01:25:35,775 --> 01:25:38,727
TRAVIS: Yep, that sounds right.

1581
01:25:38,727 --> 01:25:45,813
SAM: I must request that I sign the contract. I
can't let you do this, Percy.

1582
01:25:45,813 --> 01:25:47,049
TALIESIN: All right.

1583
01:25:47,049 --> 01:25:48,769
(laughter)

1584
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:51,004
TALIESIN: Seems fair.

1585
01:25:51,004 --> 01:25:55,155
TRAVIS: Yrat, that is most noble of you. You truly
are earning your place here.

1586
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:56,770
LAURA: Tary, that's so kind! Are you sure you want
to?

1587
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,303
SAM: Unless, of course, you want to--

1588
01:25:58,303 --> 01:26:00,025
TRAVIS: Yrat, you will be a hero to many.

1589
01:26:00,025 --> 01:26:01,462
MARISHA: Such a hero!

1590
01:26:01,462 --> 01:26:03,815
LAURA: I mean, I've never met a hero braver than
you.

1591
01:26:03,815 --> 01:26:05,259
TRAVIS: Give him a pen.

1592
01:26:05,259 --> 01:26:06,876
SAM: I--.

1593
01:26:06,876 --> 01:26:08,979
TALIESIN: We don't actually have it with us, we'd
have to go downstairs.

1594
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:10,365
LAURA: Oh. Right.

1595
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:11,452
TALIESIN: But I will-- Yeah.

1596
01:26:11,452 --> 01:26:12,505
TRAVIS: Okay.

1597
01:26:12,505 --> 01:26:22,482
LIAM: I also think, Freddie, that you're more
capable of resisting temptation, as you say.

1598
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:24,740
Sorry, Yrat.

1599
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:33,275
TALIESIN: I'll say-- I feel my weaknesses in my
heart, and I know where they lie, and I definitely

1600
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:47,097
know they exist. And I-- Nothing in this agreement
tempts me. I have temptations, but they are not in

1601
01:26:47,097 --> 01:26:48,524
this contract.

1602
01:26:48,524 --> 01:26:51,526
LIAM: And besides, you have us around you,
friend.

1603
01:26:51,526 --> 01:26:54,890
MARISHA: Is it only because you've experienced
these types of temptations before?

1604
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:59,708
TALIESIN: I think so. And I'm already-- I don't
know what's going to happen to me when I die.

1605
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:01,999
SAM: Wait, so you're signing it, now? I thought I
was signing it.

1606
01:27:01,999 --> 01:27:03,394
TALIESIN: We were messing with you--

1607
01:27:03,394 --> 01:27:04,277
SAM: Oh.

1608
01:27:04,277 --> 01:27:05,797
TALIESIN: -- but if you feel the urge to actually
take it upon yourself--

1609
01:27:05,797 --> 01:27:12,294
SAM: Well, I do think it might actually help me in
my future-- Part of it could actually help me.

1610
01:27:12,294 --> 01:27:13,253
TALIESIN: How so?

1611
01:27:13,253 --> 01:27:14,839
LAURA: So, you would actually sell your soul?

1612
01:27:14,839 --> 01:27:19,649
SAM: No, not that part. But I could use a cadre of
devils at some point.

1613
01:27:19,649 --> 01:27:21,393
LAURA: Then your soul would be forfeit!

1614
01:27:21,393 --> 01:27:22,431
SAM: No-- no.

1615
01:27:22,431 --> 01:27:24,017
TALIESIN: No, actually, not on that one.

1616
01:27:24,017 --> 01:27:27,303
TRAVIS: (laughs) Not that one! Not that part.
That's pact two.

1617
01:27:27,303 --> 01:27:31,164
MARISHA: No, we'd just have to release a couple of
devils into the material plane.

1618
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:32,438
LAURA: How about no on that?

1619
01:27:32,438 --> 01:27:33,656
MARISHA: Yes, I agree.

1620
01:27:33,656 --> 01:27:34,924
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1621
01:27:34,924 --> 01:27:36,020
LAURA: Because then we'd have to fight them.

1622
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,201
TRAVIS: Can we please go sign this contract?

1623
01:27:37,201 --> 01:27:39,550
LAURA: I mean, we could. Where in the contract
does it say we can't kill them as soon as we

1624
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:40,492
release them?

1625
01:27:40,492 --> 01:27:41,945
SAM: Nowhere.

1626
01:27:41,945 --> 01:27:48,251
LIAM: I mean, Yrat, we're still easing you in.
Freddie has a little more experience than you, and

1627
01:27:48,251 --> 01:27:50,189
I think that we can put our faith in that.

1628
01:27:50,189 --> 01:27:53,282
TALIESIN: I'm not going to say that I'm never
going to do anything stupid again, and I certainly

1629
01:27:53,282 --> 01:27:57,912
wouldn't necessarily want you to stop me if I
were, but I'm not going to do this sort of stupid,

1630
01:27:57,912 --> 01:27:59,057
am I?

1631
01:27:59,057 --> 01:28:02,171
MARISHA: Percy, if you die, though, doesn't this
mean that you forfeit your soul here--?

1632
01:28:02,171 --> 01:28:06,016
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure it doesn't. If I die
before it's finished--

1633
01:28:06,016 --> 01:28:10,500
MATT: No, no. If you complete the third pact--

1634
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,826
TALIESIN: Then yes.

1635
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:14,110
MATT: You still live, but then when you die your
soul is forfeit.

1636
01:28:14,110 --> 01:28:17,709
TALIESIN: But if I don't complete the third pact,
or if we don't activate the second or the third

1637
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,147
pact, then I'm fine--

1638
01:28:19,147 --> 01:28:20,156
MATT: Correct.

1639
01:28:20,156 --> 01:28:21,512
TALIESIN: Yeah, then there's no problem
whatsoever.

1640
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:24,637
MATT: And if by any means, at any point you break
the contract--

1641
01:28:24,637 --> 01:28:29,641
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, if we do not kill who we're
supposed to kill,

1642
01:28:29,641 --> 01:28:32,195
or if it leads back to him, then I'm--

1643
01:28:32,195 --> 01:28:35,457
LAURA: So, if you die in the process--

1644
01:28:35,457 --> 01:28:37,139
MARISHA: You're fine?

1645
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:40,081
LAURA: No, then your soul goes here--

1646
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:41,496
TALIESIN: To be fair, we're already here!

1647
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:44,689
MARISHA: That was my question. Yes, but we came
here willingly--

1648
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:46,337
LAURA: But you could become one of those melty
guys!

1649
01:28:46,337 --> 01:28:47,199
MARISHA: Yes.

1650
01:28:47,248 --> 01:28:49,944
TALIESIN: You know, it's entirely possible that
there'll be several creatures fighting over my

1651
01:28:49,944 --> 01:28:52,683
body when I die, and my soul when I die, already.

1652
01:28:52,683 --> 01:28:54,177
LAURA: I'll be one of them.

1653
01:28:54,177 --> 01:29:02,620
TALIESIN: Bless you. But no, seriously. I don't
know what any of this means.

1654
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:09,185
MARISHA: Percy, we've come here to try and kill a
kitten, and it's already been a massive pain in

1655
01:29:09,185 --> 01:29:13,201
our ass. We really don't want to come back to try
and save your soul.

1656
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:16,390
TALIESIN: Well, you'll already be here.

1657
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:19,020
LAURA: So? Don't die.

1658
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,134
TALIESIN: So we won't die.

1659
01:29:20,134 --> 01:29:23,087
TRAVIS: Hey, cool! Can we--

1660
01:29:23,087 --> 01:29:26,068
TALIESIN: And actually, it's not that clear what
would happen if I died without completing the

1661
01:29:26,068 --> 01:29:27,693
contract. I might just get brought back.

1662
01:29:27,693 --> 01:29:29,634
MATT: This would be a conversation to have with
the scribe.

1663
01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:31,118
TALIESIN: So yep, I'm going to go down. I'm going
to sign it.

1664
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:32,277
LAURA: I'm going to go down with you.

1665
01:29:32,277 --> 01:29:34,659
MARISHA: Talk about-- talk about the revisions
first! Always get those revisions first.

1666
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:36,214
TALIESIN: We're doing it.

1667
01:29:36,214 --> 01:29:37,527
MARISHA: And a new print-up.

1668
01:29:37,527 --> 01:29:38,739
LIAM: With a red pen.

1669
01:29:38,739 --> 01:29:43,180
MATT: All right. So, all of you head down into the
main chamber of the tavern, and there, returning

1670
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:50,080
to the table where he once sat, you see Ipkesh. No
wine glass, but the paper folded out in front,

1671
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,646
waiting patiently with his hands folded in the
front.

1672
01:29:53,646 --> 01:29:56,203
TALIESIN: Some quick questions--

1673
01:29:56,203 --> 01:29:57,859
MATT: "Yes, please."

1674
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:06,403
TALIESIN: I need a guide. Someone who, while is
not connected to you, can help us find our way

1675
01:30:06,403 --> 01:30:15,520
through the city. Find what we need. Answer
questions. Somebody with a little bit of the lay

1676
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:23,861
of the land. Somebody to help. Not with the actual
act, obviously, but just to run us around? What

1677
01:30:23,861 --> 01:30:28,695
happens to our soul-- what happens to my soul if I
die in the process of this?

1678
01:30:28,695 --> 01:30:33,923
MATT: "If the rest of your friends complete the
contract, your soul is fine."

1679
01:30:33,923 --> 01:30:36,962
TALIESIN: And if we don't complete the contract,
then--

1680
01:30:36,962 --> 01:30:40,196
MATT: "If you don't complete the contract, you
are in breach."

1681
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:41,825
TALIESIN: Are they in breach, or just me?

1682
01:30:41,825 --> 01:30:42,706
MATT: "Just you."

1683
01:30:42,706 --> 01:30:48,832
TALIESIN: Perfect. Safe passage into the Bastion
of Flesh. Once we're there, we're on our own?

1684
01:30:48,832 --> 01:30:52,684
MATT: "Once you are there, you are on your own.
However, I can ensure

1685
01:30:52,684 --> 01:30:55,456
"that you are brought there unharmed."

1686
01:30:55,456 --> 01:30:58,977
TALIESIN: With access to our foe?

1687
01:30:58,977 --> 01:31:02,993
MATT: "I can imagine that can be arranged."

1688
01:31:02,993 --> 01:31:05,253
TALIESIN: Can it be arranged in writing?

1689
01:31:05,253 --> 01:31:10,283
MATT: "To the extent of my capabilities, yes. Just
as you have limitations, as do I."

1690
01:31:10,283 --> 01:31:14,826
TALIESIN: I would be very pleased if we could
complete this contract, if this contract becomes

1691
01:31:14,826 --> 01:31:22,543
null and void, not with us getting to the Bastion
of Flesh, but with our return to our plane, with

1692
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:27,833
our enemy harmed. We get what we want, you get
what you want. Not we get towards what we want,

1693
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,628
you get what you want.

1694
01:31:29,628 --> 01:31:33,731
MATT: "But where in this is it fair for me to
suffer for your stupidity?"

1695
01:31:33,731 --> 01:31:38,918
TALIESIN: That is a question for the ages, isn't
it?

1696
01:31:38,918 --> 01:31:40,491
(laughter)

1697
01:31:40,491 --> 01:31:42,293
MARISHA: That we need on a t-shirt!

1698
01:31:42,293 --> 01:31:50,786
SAM: We can at least contain in the contract, once
our foe is dispatched, that you will help us

1699
01:31:50,786 --> 01:31:53,662
arrange safe passage out of here.

1700
01:31:53,662 --> 01:31:57,825
TALIESIN: You'll help us arrange our own passage--
We have a way out of this material plane, we just

1701
01:31:57,825 --> 01:32:01,896
need to make sure that we're-- Is there anything
in the prison that would not allow us to leave

1702
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:04,812
under our own power?

1703
01:32:04,812 --> 01:32:12,485
MATT: "Not to my knowledge, no. Those chambers
specifically reside within the Iron Tower. That's

1704
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:17,608
"where they imprison the extremely dangerous ones.
The Bastion of Flesh is where they keep all the

1705
01:32:17,608 --> 01:32:23,594
"living mortals that were captured on this plane
and not yet fully corrupt."

1706
01:32:23,594 --> 01:32:26,155
TALIESIN: Do they take our possessions before we
go in there?

1707
01:32:26,155 --> 01:32:30,277
MATT: "They would. However, if you so wish, I can
arrange to have them

1708
01:32:30,277 --> 01:32:32,648
"maintained in your presence."

1709
01:32:32,648 --> 01:32:33,696
MARISHA: That would be nice.

1710
01:32:33,696 --> 01:32:35,336
TALIESIN: That would be-- quite pleasing.

1711
01:32:35,336 --> 01:32:39,653
MATT: As you do that, he grabs the paper and pulls
it over, and just takes his finger and writes it

1712
01:32:39,653 --> 01:32:46,025
across, and as he does it amends the words in
the contract in front of you to include the guide

1713
01:32:46,236 --> 01:32:54,776
to lead you to where you're going, as well as
allowing your equipment to also-- unharmed and

1714
01:32:54,776 --> 01:32:57,757
unspoiled, and within your grasp.

1715
01:32:57,757 --> 01:33:02,563
TALIESIN: That will do. You do not have knowledge
of whether or not our

1716
01:33:02,563 --> 01:33:04,723
magics will work in that prison?

1717
01:33:04,723 --> 01:33:06,199
MATT: "I do not."

1718
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:07,629
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1719
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:10,701
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

1720
01:33:10,701 --> 01:33:12,679
MATT: You may.

1721
01:33:15,802 --> 01:33:17,612
LAURA: 24?

1722
01:33:17,612 --> 01:33:29,677
MATT: Okay. He seems honest. You get the sense
here: he doesn't gain anything if you all fail. If

1723
01:33:29,677 --> 01:33:33,390
you complete both sides of the contract and then
he dies, he gets nothing.

1724
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:34,724
LAURA: Right.

1725
01:33:34,724 --> 01:33:35,563
MATT: So--

1726
01:33:35,563 --> 01:33:37,563
(weird Skype noises)

1727
01:33:37,563 --> 01:33:39,118
MATT: If you were to escape--

1728
01:33:39,118 --> 01:33:41,117
LAURA: What was that?

1729
01:33:41,117 --> 01:33:42,490
MATT: If-- I dunno.

1730
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,873
LAURA: It was like an old woman was trying to talk
to us!

1731
01:33:44,873 --> 01:33:54,711
MATT: But yes. So, you get the sense that the
purpose of this contract is in

1732
01:33:54,711 --> 01:33:56,841
hopes of eventual corruption.

1733
01:33:56,841 --> 01:34:02,549
TALIESIN: That seems fair. I suppose the last
question-- And this is just my last addendment, is

1734
01:34:02,549 --> 01:34:09,304
that we own an artifact of this plane. We would
like it if possible to be identified, and for you

1735
01:34:09,304 --> 01:34:14,162
not to speak to anyone of what we have or what
it's worthwhile, and to keep our presence--

1736
01:34:14,162 --> 01:34:20,482
confidential, as much as we keep yours
confidential. Mutual confidentiality.

1737
01:34:20,482 --> 01:34:26,327
MATT: "I have nothing to gain by revealing your
presence."

1738
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:32,815
SAM: Is there any way in this contract we could
add a clause where you preorder a thousand or so

1739
01:34:32,815 --> 01:34:37,932
books to be sold by you here, later?

1740
01:34:37,932 --> 01:34:40,282
MATT: "I can write up a different contract for
you, if you like."

1741
01:34:40,282 --> 01:34:42,347
SAM: No, well, we can omit that part, that's
okay.

1742
01:34:42,347 --> 01:34:44,157
(laughter)

1743
01:34:44,157 --> 01:34:46,064
TALIESIN: I want to-- Can I show him the ring?

1744
01:34:46,064 --> 01:34:47,320
TRAVIS: What?

1745
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,621
TALIESIN: Grog, would you--

1746
01:34:48,621 --> 01:34:49,553
SAM: Greg.

1747
01:34:49,553 --> 01:34:52,223
TALIESIN: Greg, could you please show him-- I have
to sign it with my own name, I imagine, anyway--

1748
01:34:52,223 --> 01:34:53,836
Can you show him the--

1749
01:34:53,836 --> 01:34:56,212
TRAVIS: What you got?

1750
01:34:56,212 --> 01:34:57,413
SAM: Jared.

1751
01:34:57,413 --> 01:34:58,309
TALIESIN: Your piece.

1752
01:34:58,309 --> 01:34:59,730
TRAVIS: Oh.

1753
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:09,656
MATT: He kind of leans in and squints. "Hm. It is
a signet of the cult of Asmodeus. It is a trifle

1754
01:35:09,656 --> 01:35:17,051
"here, but is used on your plane to assert
belonging."

1755
01:35:17,269 --> 01:35:19,044
TALIESIN: Fair.

1756
01:35:19,044 --> 01:35:23,375
LAURA: Mmm. Okay.

1757
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:25,573
SAM: Are you sure you want to do this?

1758
01:35:25,573 --> 01:35:28,003
TALIESIN: Last question. The final question.

1759
01:35:28,003 --> 01:35:29,297
MATT: "Yes?"

1760
01:35:29,297 --> 01:35:33,678
TALIESIN: How powerful is the Herald of
Vassalage?

1761
01:35:33,678 --> 01:35:39,157
MATT: "The Herald is quite powerful. The Herald
resides within his stronghold--"

1762
01:35:39,157 --> 01:35:42,565
TALIESIN: We would have to get into his
stronghold?

1763
01:35:42,565 --> 01:35:43,653
MATT: "You would."

1764
01:35:43,653 --> 01:35:48,689
LAURA: How many enemies are we talking about
fighting, as well as him?

1765
01:35:48,881 --> 01:35:54,783
MATT: "General, guarding throughout the
stronghold, I'd put it at about a dozen, maybe."

1766
01:35:54,783 --> 01:36:00,792
LAURA: And what sort of forces does he have?

1767
01:36:00,792 --> 01:36:05,692
MATT: "Those are his forces locally. He has guards
throughout the city, but they're scattered. Thus,

1768
01:36:05,692 --> 01:36:15,103
"the importance of this is to go in unseen and
unheard. And if you run into resistance, squash it

1769
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,321
"before it can make any noise."

1770
01:36:17,321 --> 01:36:21,445
LAURA: What kind of devils are we talking about?

1771
01:36:21,445 --> 01:36:28,734
MATT: "Nothing too serious. The bearded variety.
Maybe a bone devil, maybe two, I don't know."

1772
01:36:28,734 --> 01:36:36,026
TALIESIN: And this creature itself? A horn devil?

1773
01:36:36,026 --> 01:36:37,969
MATT: "Oh, this is a pit fiend."

1774
01:36:37,969 --> 01:36:40,401
MARISHA: Oh, again? Jesus, fuck--

1775
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:42,548
SAM: We've fought-- Oh, you've fought those
before.

1776
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:43,668
(laughter)

1777
01:36:43,668 --> 01:36:45,329
TALIESIN: What is this 'we'?

1778
01:36:45,329 --> 01:36:46,606
SAM: Well, we're a team now.

1779
01:36:46,606 --> 01:36:54,935
MATT: "But Utugash is strong but slow. Slovenly,
sluggish. Has reveled in his own opulence for far

1780
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:56,381
"too long."

1781
01:36:56,381 --> 01:37:01,326
TALIESIN: What's another dead pit fiend in hell?

1782
01:37:01,326 --> 01:37:03,068
SAM: I'll sign it.

1783
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:04,856
MARISHA: Ask about the Bastion of Flesh--

1784
01:37:04,856 --> 01:37:06,611
TRAVIS: Do it. Do it now, do it quickly.

1785
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:08,273
MARISHA: Ask about the Bastion of Flesh.

1786
01:37:08,273 --> 01:37:09,704
LIAM: Fred, get that, sign it.

1787
01:37:09,704 --> 01:37:11,080
TALIESIN: What about the Bastion of Flesh?

1788
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,240
MARISHA: Well, how big is this prison--

1789
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:15,493
SAM: Maybe I should sign this, I don't want you to
corrupt yourself senselessly.

1790
01:37:15,493 --> 01:37:16,719
TRAVIS: Arm wrestle.

1791
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,757
LIAM: I push Yrat back, away from Freddie.

1792
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:21,947
SAM: Ah!

1793
01:37:21,947 --> 01:37:24,813
(laughter)

1794
01:37:24,813 --> 01:37:26,010
TALIESIN: All right.

1795
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:29,423
LIAM: You're here, enjoy the ride. Freddie has
this, thank you.

1796
01:37:29,423 --> 01:37:30,989
TALIESIN: I'm signing.

1797
01:37:30,989 --> 01:37:34,583
LAURA: Oh my lord.

1798
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:39,151
TALIESIN: I check to see his name, is it his real
name that is signed?

1799
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:44,076
MATT: I mean, it seems to be the contract wouldn't
be binding on his end if it wasn't.

1800
01:37:44,076 --> 01:37:49,828
TALIESIN: Mm, all right. Not the full name, but
enough.

1801
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:51,241
MARISHA: Not the full name?

1802
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:52,037
LAURA: No.

1803
01:37:52,037 --> 01:37:53,015
SAM: PDR.

1804
01:37:53,015 --> 01:37:54,137
TRAVIS: D. Rolo.

1805
01:37:54,137 --> 01:37:56,238
SAM: (high-pitched) D-Roll!

1806
01:37:56,238 --> 01:37:57,539
LAURA: Musel.

1807
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,577
MATT: You don't have to write the entire name.

1808
01:37:58,577 --> 01:37:59,538
MARISHA: (laughs) Musel

1809
01:37:59,538 --> 01:38:01,265
TALIESIN: Oh no, wait, it's happen-- No, I'm not
doing that.

1810
01:38:01,265 --> 01:38:03,838
MATT: (laughs) We'll say you do, in character.

1811
01:38:03,838 --> 01:38:05,403
TALIESIN: No, I've actually finished it.

1812
01:38:05,403 --> 01:38:15,475
MATT: Okay. As you finish signing, the ink kind of
flashes and glows and it burns into the parchment

1813
01:38:15,475 --> 01:38:22,348
ever so slightly, to the point where you smell the
scent of just slightly singed parchment. It curls

1814
01:38:22,348 --> 01:38:25,646
up away from you and into his grasp as he takes
it.

1815
01:38:25,646 --> 01:38:28,798
TALIESIN: What's a devil to a man who fears no
god?

1816
01:38:28,798 --> 01:38:36,691
MATT: "Hm. Pleasure doing business. Now." And he
snaps his fingers, and you watch, kind of apparate

1817
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:40,599
on one shoulder, one of the imps that you saw
earlier--

1818
01:38:40,599 --> 01:38:41,844
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, those little guys!

1819
01:38:41,844 --> 01:38:46,972
MATT: -- when you arrived, that kind of saw you
and rushed out when you were coming downstairs. It

1820
01:38:46,972 --> 01:38:52,808
appears on his shoulder. "This is Vasa. He will be
your guide."

1821
01:38:52,808 --> 01:38:56,073
ALL: Vasa.

1822
01:38:56,073 --> 01:38:57,175
SAM: With an r, or with an h?

1823
01:38:57,175 --> 01:38:58,206
LAURA: Well, that sounds familiar.

1824
01:38:58,206 --> 01:39:00,425
MATT: Vasa. V-A-S-A.

1825
01:39:00,425 --> 01:39:04,023
LAURA: Of course our father would be named after a
fucking imp.

1826
01:39:04,023 --> 01:39:08,032
MATT: Vessar is your last name. Vasa is
different.

1827
01:39:08,032 --> 01:39:11,537
LAURA: Sounds close e-fucking-nough.

1828
01:39:11,537 --> 01:39:13,919
TALIESIN: Whitney warned me it would come to
this.

1829
01:39:13,919 --> 01:39:18,308
MARISHA: Who? What?

1830
01:39:18,308 --> 01:39:21,954
TALIESIN: It's my sister, you never met her.

1831
01:39:21,954 --> 01:39:26,070
MATT: "Vasa will guide you. Thankfully, the
stronghold is near the torture pits, so there is

1832
01:39:26,119 --> 01:39:38,243
"general din and sound and agony to surround. So
that might offer you some solace in being unheard.

1833
01:39:38,243 --> 01:39:40,325
"But be careful."

1834
01:39:40,325 --> 01:39:43,993
TALIESIN: Any advice would be welcome. We want
what you want.

1835
01:39:43,993 --> 01:39:54,474
MATT: "I know. Rest. Prepare. Enter where is
easiest, always the path of least resistance. Get

1836
01:39:54,474 --> 01:40:06,498
"the jump, surprise and silence. When it's time to
leave, I can help you travel mostly unseen, should

1837
01:40:06,551 --> 01:40:12,825
"you avoid some of the more piercing eyes of this
domain."

1838
01:40:12,825 --> 01:40:18,418
TALIESIN: Would you know where to get a Silence
spell, out of curiosity?

1839
01:40:18,418 --> 01:40:20,393
MATT: "I can provide maybe one or two."

1840
01:40:20,393 --> 01:40:23,589
TALIESIN: One would be-- two would be even more
helpful.

1841
01:40:23,589 --> 01:40:29,306
MATT: "Very well. Rest. I'll be here waiting."

1842
01:40:29,306 --> 01:40:33,830
LAURA: If no one sees us kill him, how will we be
arrested?

1843
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:41,769
MATT: "Don't worry, I'll know when he's down as
I'm sending Vasa along with you."

1844
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,024
LAURA: All right.

1845
01:40:43,024 --> 01:40:50,751
MATT: "And once this is known, just wait. Because
the alarm will call the guard, specifically the

1846
01:40:50,751 --> 01:40:52,858
"ones that work for me."

1847
01:40:52,913 --> 01:40:54,104
LAURA: All right.

1848
01:40:54,104 --> 01:40:55,521
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1849
01:40:55,521 --> 01:41:00,747
LAURA: So, we should make sure after we kill this
big guy not to kill anyone else that comes for us?

1850
01:41:00,747 --> 01:41:07,646
MATT: "No one that seem to be under his employ,
no. Otherwise, clear them out."

1851
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:13,434
LAURA: Okay. Perfectly simple.

1852
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:17,488
SAM: Let's go plan our attack.

1853
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,716
LAURA: Yeah.

1854
01:41:19,716 --> 01:41:23,934
MATT: All right. As you guys make your way back to
your room to discuss, we're going to take a break.

1855
01:41:23,934 --> 01:41:25,174
MARISHA: Yes!

1856
01:41:25,174 --> 01:41:31,155
MATT: We'll be back here in just a few moments. We
have our tiger maple dice tower giveaway at the

1857
01:41:31,155 --> 01:41:32,893
break from our friends at--

1858
01:41:32,893 --> 01:41:34,239
MARISHA: Ooh, tiger maple!

1859
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:37,027
MATT: Oh my god, it's all in pieces still, oh god!
But yeah, it's all magnetically put together.

1860
01:41:37,027 --> 01:41:38,138
LAURA: Wait, what?

1861
01:41:38,138 --> 01:41:40,032
TALIESIN: Make-- make the-- the weird little
magnet things happen.

1862
01:41:40,032 --> 01:41:40,979
MATT: I know, you can make it--

1863
01:41:40,979 --> 01:41:41,964
LAURA: Oh wait, it's a dice tower?

1864
01:41:41,964 --> 01:41:44,238
MARISHA: It's a dice tower where you make the
magnets happen

1865
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:47,048
MATT: That all magnetizes together. It's pretty
rad. So, yeah.

1866
01:41:47,048 --> 01:41:49,649
Do we have a code word for the chat?

1867
01:41:49,649 --> 01:41:50,892
CREW: You pick.

1868
01:41:50,892 --> 01:41:54,687
MATT: I pick? The code word will be 'pact'.
P-A-C-T.

1869
01:41:54,687 --> 01:41:55,548
LAURA: Ooh.

1870
01:41:55,548 --> 01:42:00,042
MATT: So go ahead and come over to the Twitch chat
room, use the word 'pact' in there to join the

1871
01:42:00,094 --> 01:42:01,975
chance giveaway.

1872
01:42:01,975 --> 01:42:03,962
TALIESIN: And take the survey if you have a
moment!

1873
01:42:03,962 --> 01:42:04,846
MATT: Exactly!

1874
01:42:04,846 --> 01:42:05,906
MARISHA: Go take that survey!

1875
01:42:05,906 --> 01:42:07,181
MATT: Awesome! See you guys in a few minutes.

1876
01:42:07,181 --> 01:42:08,064
TRAVIS: Pact!

1877
01:42:08,064 --> 01:54:45,123
[break]

1878
01:54:45,176 --> 01:54:49,397
MATT: Hello guys, and welcome back! All right! So,
before we get in, real fast, we have the winner in

1879
01:54:49,397 --> 01:54:54,784
chat, the winner of the dice box is iccara!
Iccara, congratulations!

1880
01:54:54,784 --> 01:54:55,887
(cheering)

1881
01:54:55,887 --> 01:54:59,206
MATT: And well won! There you go. Get that info
for you and get that sent out to you ASAP, so

1882
01:54:59,206 --> 01:55:02,686
congratulations. Also, I forgot to mention because
I didn't put it on the thing before, but I'm also,

1883
01:55:02,686 --> 01:55:07,995
I'll put it on Twitter, I'm going to be guesting
at Sakura Con, middle of April, April 14th to the

1884
01:55:07,995 --> 01:55:11,661
16th up in Seattle. So if you guys are up there in
that area come say hi.

1885
01:55:11,661 --> 01:55:12,653
MARISHA: Easter weekend!

1886
01:55:12,653 --> 01:55:16,950
MATT: Yeah. Panels and signings and all that fun
stuff. So folks near and around the Seattle area,

1887
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:19,661
come up to Sakura Con and say hi.

1888
01:55:19,661 --> 01:55:21,142
MARISHA: I'm going camping.

1889
01:55:21,142 --> 01:55:21,886
MATT: Yeah.

1890
01:55:21,886 --> 01:55:22,719
LAURA: Really?

1891
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:23,613
MARISHA: Yeah.

1892
01:55:23,613 --> 01:55:24,472
LAURA: That's exciting.

1893
01:55:24,472 --> 01:55:25,489
TALIESIN: Oh man.

1894
01:55:25,489 --> 01:55:27,567
MARISHA: Yeah, it's going to be so good.

1895
01:55:27,567 --> 01:55:32,865
MATT: Okay. Bringing it back in. So you guys have
signed a contract. What do you to prep? What are

1896
01:55:32,865 --> 01:55:33,847
you doing now?

1897
01:55:33,847 --> 01:55:34,639
SAM: Going to sleep.

1898
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:36,404
LAURA: Wait, we need to prep anything?

1899
01:55:36,404 --> 01:55:37,298
MATT: You're locked in.

1900
01:55:37,298 --> 01:55:39,100
TRAVIS: Only one of us is locked in.

1901
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:42,207
LAURA: Well, what's our plan? We go in, we fucking
try to stealth as much as fucking possible and

1902
01:55:42,207 --> 01:55:43,765
kill a fucking pit fiend.

1903
01:55:43,765 --> 01:55:47,986
MARISHA: Stealth in, kill a pit fiend. Done it
before, we can do it again. Okay, I'm confident

1904
01:55:47,986 --> 01:55:49,096
about this plan.

1905
01:55:49,096 --> 01:55:51,784
LAURA: How did we do it-- Wait, wait, wait. Let's
just remember, how did we do it last time?

1906
01:55:51,784 --> 01:55:52,916
MARISHA: How did we do it last time?

1907
01:55:52,916 --> 01:55:55,373
TRAVIS: We bumblefucked our way into it, got super
super lucky--

1908
01:55:55,373 --> 01:55:58,869
MARISHA: And bumblefucked our way out of it.

1909
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:00,850
LAURA: Was he weak to anything that we remember?

1910
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:01,685
TRAVIS: No.

1911
01:56:01,685 --> 01:56:02,458
MATT: Nope.

1912
01:56:02,458 --> 01:56:03,274
LAURA: Nothing?

1913
01:56:03,274 --> 01:56:05,097
LIAM: But he was extremely frightening.

1914
01:56:05,097 --> 01:56:06,660
TRAVIS: And smart. Very smart.

1915
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,268
LAURA: Oh, so definitely do a Feast?

1916
01:56:08,268 --> 01:56:09,283
MATT: And poison.

1917
01:56:09,283 --> 01:56:12,464
MARISHA: I can do-- Nope, nope, I can't.

1918
01:56:12,464 --> 01:56:15,166
MATT: You guys technically are still under the
effects of a Feast.

1919
01:56:15,166 --> 01:56:17,068
LAURA: Yeah, but we won't be when we go to fight
him.

1920
01:56:17,068 --> 01:56:18,518
MATT: Depends on how soon you get there.

1921
01:56:18,518 --> 01:56:20,089
LAURA: No, but--

1922
01:56:20,089 --> 01:56:21,470
SAM: We're sleeping.

1923
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:23,362
MATT: The Feast lasts for 24 hours.

1924
01:56:23,362 --> 01:56:24,807
LAURA: So if we rest--

1925
01:56:24,807 --> 01:56:30,768
MATT: It's been probably, if you start resting
fairly soon, it will have been maybe four to five

1926
01:56:30,768 --> 01:56:36,701
hours after you used this-- or ate the Feast. With
the eight hours' full rest, you're still looking

1927
01:56:36,701 --> 01:56:39,059
at almost half a day left. It's up to you.

1928
01:56:39,059 --> 01:56:39,902
SAM: Oh, all right.

1929
01:56:39,902 --> 01:56:40,948
MATT: Up to you.

1930
01:56:40,948 --> 01:56:41,715
MARISHA: Sick.

1931
01:56:41,715 --> 01:56:42,760
SAM: Yeah, let's do it.

1932
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:44,813
TALIESIN: I for one am going to have some sleepy
time tea.

1933
01:56:44,813 --> 01:56:49,462
TRAVIS: I lost a lot of hit points actually today.
I could use a recharge.

1934
01:56:49,462 --> 01:56:51,130
TALIESIN: Warm milk of the damned.

1935
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:52,234
LAURA: All that thinking.

1936
01:56:52,234 --> 01:56:53,892
SAM: Okay, let's go to sleep.

1937
01:56:53,892 --> 01:56:55,636
MARISHA: Eat your cheerios, bud.

1938
01:56:55,636 --> 01:57:04,065
MATT: All right. You guys have an evening's rest
in the second layer of hell, within the Iron City

1939
01:57:04,065 --> 01:57:05,130
of Dis.

1940
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:07,025
LAURA: Are the beds painfully hot?

1941
01:57:07,025 --> 01:57:09,025
MATT: The beds are warm. They're very toasty.

1942
01:57:09,025 --> 01:57:10,017
LAURA: Okay.

1943
01:57:10,017 --> 01:57:13,588
MATT: It's like trying to fall asleep in middle of
the summer in the Valley with no air conditioning.

1944
01:57:13,588 --> 01:57:16,482
It can be done. But you're sweaty and it's not
very comfortable.

1945
01:57:16,482 --> 01:57:17,837
MARISHA: What, the sheets?

1946
01:57:17,837 --> 01:57:19,687
LAURA: The whole experience.

1947
01:57:19,687 --> 01:57:20,742
MATT: Maybe, yeah.

1948
01:57:20,742 --> 01:57:23,736
SAM: I have someone fanning me the entire night.

1949
01:57:23,736 --> 01:57:25,651
MARISHA: Doty.

1950
01:57:25,651 --> 01:57:27,019
SAM: Yes.

1951
01:57:27,019 --> 01:57:30,373
MATT: It does help somewhat. You're the most
comfortable sleeper in the entire group. All

1952
01:57:30,373 --> 01:57:35,398
right, I need all of you guys to roll a wisdom
saving throw, if you don't mind.

1953
01:57:35,398 --> 01:57:39,065
LAURA: At advantage though, right? Because of the
Heroes' Feast.

1954
01:57:39,065 --> 01:57:41,593
MATT: That's correct.

1955
01:57:41,593 --> 01:57:42,765
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1956
01:57:42,765 --> 01:57:44,667
SAM: Natural 20 here as well.

1957
01:57:44,667 --> 01:57:48,209
MARISHA: I got a 17 and an 18, that's pretty damn
good.

1958
01:57:48,209 --> 01:57:50,783
TALIESIN: That'll do. Wisdom saving?

1959
01:57:50,783 --> 01:57:51,631
MATT: Yep.

1960
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:54,761
TALIESIN: 19.

1961
01:57:54,761 --> 01:57:56,961
LAURA: 11.

1962
01:57:57,124 --> 01:57:57,997
MATT: Okay.

1963
01:57:57,997 --> 01:57:58,886
MARISHA: 32.

1964
01:57:58,886 --> 01:57:59,781
SAM: With advantage?

1965
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:00,517
LAURA: Yeah.

1966
01:58:00,517 --> 01:58:01,222
MATT: Vax?

1967
01:58:01,222 --> 01:58:02,294
LIAM: 16.

1968
01:58:02,294 --> 01:58:09,540
MATT: Okay. You guys all awaken, rested, as you
know, in a similar way you're rested after being

1969
01:58:09,597 --> 01:58:15,277
out open under the night's sky on the side of the
road in a campsite. It's not the best rest, but

1970
01:58:15,277 --> 01:58:21,577
it's enough to at least continue with some wind
back in your sails. Other than that, you are

1971
01:58:21,577 --> 01:58:24,473
feeling a little bit hungry.

1972
01:58:24,473 --> 01:58:26,281
TRAVIS: How am I feeling?

1973
01:58:26,281 --> 01:58:28,031
MATT: You're feeling fine.

1974
01:58:28,031 --> 01:58:30,331
MARISHA: Don't we still have some rations that we
have been carrying around with

1975
01:58:30,331 --> 01:58:31,592
us for quite some time?

1976
01:58:31,592 --> 01:58:33,725
LAURA: I mean yeah, we have a lot of stuff in the
bag of colding.

1977
01:58:33,725 --> 01:58:35,202
TALIESIN: Do we have any souls?

1978
01:58:35,202 --> 01:58:37,005
TRAVIS: The stuff downstairs is really not that
bad.

1979
01:58:37,005 --> 01:58:39,373
LAURA: No souls in the bag of colding, but we do
have--

1980
01:58:39,373 --> 01:58:42,838
TALIESIN: Is it not that bad or is it just
slightly above awful?

1981
01:58:42,838 --> 01:58:43,643
TRAVIS: Yes?

1982
01:58:43,643 --> 01:58:44,481
TALIESIN: Okay.

1983
01:58:44,481 --> 01:58:48,484
LAURA: We do have half a thing of boar meat and
some grain. Just some random grain. Which I think

1984
01:58:48,484 --> 01:58:50,593
is like oatmeal oats, maybe.

1985
01:58:50,593 --> 01:58:51,969
TALIESIN: Put some hot water on it and--

1986
01:58:51,969 --> 01:58:53,490
LAURA: All water here is hot.

1987
01:58:53,490 --> 01:58:55,519
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1988
01:58:55,519 --> 01:58:59,950
LAURA: I'm going to sit the boar meat down on the
ground and cook it a little bit.

1989
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:06,953
MATT: And actually it cooks pretty easily. There
are portions of the iron metal, especially on the

1990
01:59:06,953 --> 01:59:10,272
bottom floor, that cook it pretty well.

1991
01:59:10,272 --> 01:59:12,076
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the gun barrel to sear
it a bit.

1992
01:59:12,076 --> 01:59:13,650
LAURA: Yeah, make some grill marks on that thing.

1993
01:59:13,650 --> 01:59:20,179
MATT: All right. And you manage to cook a decent--
And the boar meat's been frozen for a while, so

1994
01:59:20,179 --> 01:59:25,649
it's not the best, but it's better than bone
splinter meat chunks.

1995
01:59:25,649 --> 01:59:27,137
LAURA: Or eating souls.

1996
01:59:27,137 --> 01:59:29,518
TRAVIS: Don't judge it until you try it.

1997
01:59:29,518 --> 01:59:33,427
LAURA: Did that use up all of the boar meat? Or am
I down to like a quarter of a boar meat now?

1998
01:59:33,427 --> 01:59:34,862
MATT: How much did you have?

1999
01:59:34,862 --> 01:59:36,723
LAURA: Half a boar meat. I have no idea what that
means.

2000
01:59:36,723 --> 01:59:37,831
SAM: Half a boar?

2001
01:59:37,831 --> 01:59:43,754
MATT: Half a boar meat? Half a boar, between all
of you guys, including Grog's appetite, I'd say

2002
01:59:43,754 --> 01:59:44,768
that's about it.

2003
01:59:44,768 --> 01:59:45,702
LAURA: It's gone?

2004
01:59:45,702 --> 01:59:46,574
MATT: That boar is gone.

2005
01:59:46,574 --> 01:59:47,382
LAURA: Damn it.

2006
01:59:47,382 --> 01:59:49,464
LIAM: That's like Super Nintendo lingo. Can I have
half a boar meat?

2007
01:59:49,464 --> 01:59:54,829
LAURA: Oh, that's the worst eraser. It just made a
pink smudge across the page.

2008
01:59:54,829 --> 01:59:55,787
MATT: Oh no!

2009
01:59:55,787 --> 01:59:57,332
LAURA: That's the worst.

2010
01:59:57,332 --> 01:59:58,355
TALIESIN: You'd like to try my eraser?

2011
01:59:58,355 --> 01:59:59,523
LAURA: No, this one's good.

2012
01:59:59,523 --> 02:00:02,063
MATT: Wow, we just had a very Oregon Trail moment.
I'm proud of us.

2013
02:00:02,063 --> 02:00:05,108
LAURA: Look at us using rations!

2014
02:00:05,108 --> 02:00:07,576
SAM: We've never done that before.

2015
02:00:07,576 --> 02:00:10,983
MATT: Not since the beginning, yeah. All righty.

2016
02:00:10,983 --> 02:00:20,861
SAM: All right. Where do we find this-- Oh, wait,
did Zahra-- Vasa spend the night with us?

2017
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:21,908
MATT: No.

2018
02:00:21,908 --> 02:00:23,587
SAM: Where is Vasa?

2019
02:00:23,587 --> 02:00:24,546
MATT: You have no idea.

2020
02:00:24,546 --> 02:00:25,981
LAURA: Downstairs, I assume.

2021
02:00:25,981 --> 02:00:29,234
SAM: All right. Should we go downstairs and find
Vasa, because that's who's going to lead us to

2022
02:00:29,234 --> 02:00:34,860
this place, right? Vasa! Vasa!

2023
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:37,126
TALIESIN: Don't speak so loudly.

2024
02:00:37,126 --> 02:00:38,576
SAM: Well, you said not to whisper.

2025
02:00:38,576 --> 02:00:39,865
TALIESIN: I didn't say not to whisper.

2026
02:00:39,865 --> 02:00:41,366
LAURA: Don't make a scene, either. It's
important.

2027
02:00:41,366 --> 02:00:42,596
TALIESIN: Act natural.

2028
02:00:42,596 --> 02:00:44,652
LAURA: Just be as cool and calm as possible.

2029
02:00:44,652 --> 02:00:47,144
TALIESIN: Yes. Don't act natural, be as cool and
calm as possible.

2030
02:00:47,144 --> 02:00:48,661
LIAM: And he's doing that, unfortunately.

2031
02:00:48,661 --> 02:00:49,856
SAM: I'm always cool.

2032
02:00:49,856 --> 02:00:52,522
TALIESIN: That's the spirit. Just like that.

2033
02:00:52,522 --> 02:00:54,571
LAURA: Good acting.

2034
02:00:54,571 --> 02:00:58,391
TRAVIS: Do we see the imp downstairs anywhere?

2035
02:00:58,391 --> 02:01:05,743
MATT: As you head downstairs, you do notice that
Ipkesh is sitting at one of the chairs at the far

2036
02:01:05,743 --> 02:01:10,876
end of the bar. The usual keeper of the
establishment is not currently there. There is

2037
02:01:10,876 --> 02:01:17,755
nobody else in the bottom portion. It is empty,
and the imp, Vasa, is currently resting on the

2038
02:01:17,755 --> 02:01:21,274
shoulder of Ipkesh, as you approach.

2039
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:23,819
TRAVIS: Close it down for a bit, did you?

2040
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:31,122
MATT: "Just to be safe. Best not to have
individuals knowing of our present arrangements or

2041
02:01:31,122 --> 02:01:34,960
"your group exit applying to me."

2042
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:38,258
LIAM: You're going to introduce us to your little
friend there?

2043
02:01:38,258 --> 02:01:41,024
LAURA: He did. It's Vasa.

2044
02:01:41,024 --> 02:01:43,186
LIAM: I know his name, thank you.

2045
02:01:43,186 --> 02:01:54,323
MATT: "Vasa will be able to bring you to your
location. Vasa's mastery is in not being seen and

2046
02:01:54,323 --> 02:02:02,226
"keeping beneath the eyes of the Whisperers. Vasa
will not be able to aid you in the confrontation,

2047
02:02:02,226 --> 02:02:07,290
"for Vasa is as strong as the parchment you signed
yesterday."

2048
02:02:07,290 --> 02:02:13,281
TALIESIN: Any luck on those other materials?
Silence spell or two?

2049
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:20,018
MATT: "Mm-hm." And he pulls from a small satchel
on the side of his long, black and purple robe,

2050
02:02:20,018 --> 02:02:27,485
this small, leather case that is locked on one
side. And as he pulls it open and reveals this

2051
02:02:27,485 --> 02:02:36,858
very, very tightly wound piece of parchment, and
he hands it over. "This is a Silence spell. I

2052
02:02:36,858 --> 02:02:42,068
"could not procure two, unfortunately. But this
will aid you."

2053
02:02:42,068 --> 02:02:50,144
LAURA: The Whisperers you speak of. Do they see
through illusions?

2054
02:02:50,144 --> 02:02:59,269
MATT: "The Whisperers, they do not see through
illusions, but they do see through invisibility."

2055
02:02:59,269 --> 02:03:01,335
LAURA: All right.

2056
02:03:01,335 --> 02:03:12,224
MATT: "At least-- not all of them. The bigger
ones. If you see any that are larger than our

2057
02:03:12,224 --> 02:03:16,806
"winged compatriot here, those are the ones to
avoid."

2058
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:25,548
LAURA: Okay. I feel like a good idea would be to
just--

2059
02:03:25,548 --> 02:03:26,837
SAM: Go?

2060
02:03:26,837 --> 02:03:35,126
LAURA: Yeah. But I mean, can't we just Alter
Selves into little bugs or something, and get in

2061
02:03:35,126 --> 02:03:36,521
behind him? Surprise him?

2062
02:03:36,521 --> 02:03:37,909
SAM: No, it's not a Polymorph spell.

2063
02:03:37,909 --> 02:03:39,883
MARISHA: I could Animal Shapes us there, yeah.

2064
02:03:39,883 --> 02:03:40,931
TALIESIN: How many of us?

2065
02:03:40,931 --> 02:03:42,167
MARISHA: All of us.

2066
02:03:42,167 --> 02:03:44,124
TALIESIN: Then you'd be down a spell.

2067
02:03:44,124 --> 02:03:48,242
MARISHA: Eighth level, but it could be worth it to
not be seen and get the drop.

2068
02:03:48,242 --> 02:03:55,913
TALIESIN: Do you think that sounds like a
reasonable plan or do you think that's--

2069
02:03:55,913 --> 02:04:00,537
MATT: "That sounds, if that is within your
capability, that sounds very reasonable."

2070
02:04:00,537 --> 02:04:06,016
LAURA: And Vasa could get us into the keep? As
insects?

2071
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:08,858
MATT: "Vasa could show you the way in, yes."

2072
02:04:08,858 --> 02:04:11,670
LAURA: Could be good.

2073
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:17,020
SAM: Are we-- yeah, are we wasting spells just to
get there?

2074
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:19,608
LAURA: A spell. But it's a surprise attack.

2075
02:04:19,608 --> 02:04:23,866
MARISHA: I imagine we'd get there, do Animal
Shapes to get through and get to him.

2076
02:04:23,866 --> 02:04:28,095
LAURA: And then pop out and attack him, right from
bugness.

2077
02:04:28,095 --> 02:04:32,285
MARISHA: Yeah. Bugness Everdeen.

2078
02:04:32,285 --> 02:04:34,174
TRAVIS: Okay. That was sour.

2079
02:04:34,174 --> 02:04:35,702
LAURA: I liked it.

2080
02:04:35,702 --> 02:04:37,866
MARISHA: Thank you. Laura liked it.

2081
02:04:37,866 --> 02:04:43,529
LIAM: With the right conditions, if we keep quiet,
I can lay some pretty heavy hurt on this guy at

2082
02:04:43,529 --> 02:04:46,673
the get-go. If we keep quiet.

2083
02:04:46,673 --> 02:04:54,489
SAM: All right. Let's bug it up, then.

2084
02:04:54,541 --> 02:04:57,480
MATT: So, this is Animal Shapes into a-- What form
are you taking?

2085
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:58,597
TALIESIN: Are we doing it now or later?

2086
02:04:58,597 --> 02:04:59,807
MARISHA: Later. Not now.

2087
02:04:59,807 --> 02:05:02,785
MATT: Right. But what form are you taking?

2088
02:05:02,785 --> 02:05:06,817
MARISHA: Let me figure that out. Who's got a
Player's Handbook in the house?

2089
02:05:06,817 --> 02:05:09,737
SAM: Right here. 20 foot radius, centered on a
point, not on a object.

2090
02:05:09,737 --> 02:05:13,540
MARISHA: Animal Shapes. What are you looking at?

2091
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:15,644
TALIESIN: This is us. Looking at Silence spells.

2092
02:05:15,644 --> 02:05:19,475
MATT: Animal Shapes. Basically, you guys can
become a large or smaller beast.

2093
02:05:19,475 --> 02:05:22,636
MARISHA: Large or smaller beast. So I can't do
anything--

2094
02:05:22,636 --> 02:05:24,868
LAURA: We can't be insects? Are those beasts?

2095
02:05:24,868 --> 02:05:26,089
MARISHA: -- microscopic?

2096
02:05:26,089 --> 02:05:27,496
MATT: Micro-- No.

2097
02:05:27,496 --> 02:05:32,049
MARISHA: Not microscopic but tiny. I can't be
tiny?

2098
02:05:32,049 --> 02:05:33,905
MATT: I mean, bird-size would be about as small as
you could get.

2099
02:05:33,905 --> 02:05:35,121
MARISHA: Bird-size.

2100
02:05:35,121 --> 02:05:39,022
TRAVIS: Boy, that sure sounds like food.

2101
02:05:39,022 --> 02:05:46,760
LAURA: Yeah, are there any other creatures here
that are small that go unseen? The size of rats or

2102
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:49,742
birds of some sort?

2103
02:05:49,742 --> 02:05:55,545
MATT: "I mean, there are fiendish variations and
there are rats that exist on this plane, though

2104
02:05:55,545 --> 02:06:00,943
"life for them is not very enjoyable."

2105
02:06:00,943 --> 02:06:02,477
LAURA: Well, shit.

2106
02:06:02,477 --> 02:06:05,112
TRAVIS: We would be running on the blazing hot
ground.

2107
02:06:05,112 --> 02:06:07,438
LAURA: Oh, right. Poor little burning rats.

2108
02:06:07,438 --> 02:06:11,557
TRAVIS: And flying in the imp-covered air.

2109
02:06:11,557 --> 02:06:17,743
SAM: Didn't he say Vasa can get us there, right?
Can get us safe passage?

2110
02:06:17,743 --> 02:06:20,379
LAURA: Fuck it. I was just thinking it was a
thing, but forget it.

2111
02:06:20,379 --> 02:06:22,723
TRAVIS: It's all in the contract.

2112
02:06:22,723 --> 02:06:25,012
MATT: "So. Shall Vasa guide you?"

2113
02:06:25,012 --> 02:06:26,298
LAURA: Yes, let's do it.

2114
02:06:26,298 --> 02:06:35,554
MATT: "Very well." Taps the edge and Vasa's been
watching, goes, "Come follow me." And takes off of

2115
02:06:35,554 --> 02:06:36,757
the side of his shoulder.

2116
02:06:36,757 --> 02:06:37,765
LAURA: He talks?

2117
02:06:37,765 --> 02:06:44,347
MATT: You guys have spoken with an imp before. And
the imp (fwsh) out the window, grabs onto the side

2118
02:06:44,347 --> 02:06:48,080
of the doorframe, and then scurries onto the
outside and turns back around and looks inside.

2119
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:49,497
"Come. Come."

2120
02:06:49,497 --> 02:06:51,530
TRAVIS: We go. We follow.

2121
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:53,153
SAM: I will lead us.

2122
02:06:53,153 --> 02:06:55,052
TRAVIS: Do we need Pass Without A Trace?

2123
02:06:55,052 --> 02:06:58,436
LAURA: Yeah, I cast Pass Without A Trace on us.

2124
02:06:58,436 --> 02:07:02,329
MARISHA: I'm Alter Selfing into my tiefling form.

2125
02:07:02,329 --> 02:07:06,744
MATT: All righty. That being the case, you guys
step outside onto the street and you watch as Vasa

2126
02:07:06,744 --> 02:07:11,383
disappears down the same alleyway that you
previously had nearly been assaulted in, Keyleth.

2127
02:07:11,383 --> 02:07:14,262
You guys, I need you all to make stealth checks.

2128
02:07:14,262 --> 02:07:16,072
TALIESIN: With advantage?

2129
02:07:16,072 --> 02:07:18,212
LAURA: Yeah. No, add ten.

2130
02:07:18,212 --> 02:07:20,496
MARISHA: That's good.

2131
02:07:20,496 --> 02:07:22,873
TRAVIS: Motherfucker. Natural 20.

2132
02:07:22,873 --> 02:07:24,148
MATT: Jesus.

2133
02:07:24,148 --> 02:07:25,445
TRAVIS: Two in a row.

2134
02:07:25,445 --> 02:07:27,180
TALIESIN: 30.

2135
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:28,247
SAM: 24.

2136
02:07:28,247 --> 02:07:29,509
MARISHA: 38.

2137
02:07:29,509 --> 02:07:31,043
LIAM: 44.

2138
02:07:31,043 --> 02:07:32,226
LAURA: 39.

2139
02:07:32,226 --> 02:07:37,730
MATT: All right. So, for the first leg of this
journey, as you're watching as Vasa is darting

2140
02:07:37,730 --> 02:07:43,593
from edge to edge and occasionally almost
dematerializing and turning invisible. And for a

2141
02:07:43,593 --> 02:07:47,886
moment you have to stop and look around, and then
you watch his form appear off in the distance and

2142
02:07:47,886 --> 02:07:53,817
shoot up a tiny little lit flare to gather your
attention once any large Whisperers pass overhead.

2143
02:07:53,817 --> 02:08:01,188
And this process of rubberbanding behind Vasa
continues over the next half an hour or so, going

2144
02:08:01,188 --> 02:08:05,542
deeper and deeper into the city. And as you go,
Vex, you're keeping a pretty close watch on where

2145
02:08:05,542 --> 02:08:11,259
you're coming from, though you're also seeing
large groups of lemures, which is how it's

2146
02:08:11,259 --> 02:08:14,844
pronounced as I've been corrected and I'm so glad
it's pronounced that and not lemurs, because that

2147
02:08:14,844 --> 02:08:16,755
sounds awful as hell. It's lemure.

2148
02:08:16,755 --> 02:08:18,147
MARISHA: But lemurs are so cute.

2149
02:08:18,147 --> 02:08:20,568
MATT: I know. And they're not cute. They're
horrible, fleshy, tortured souls.

2150
02:08:20,568 --> 02:08:23,491
LIAM: That's my nickname, man. Don't shit on my
nickname.

2151
02:08:23,491 --> 02:08:24,922
MARISHA: Lemurs!

2152
02:08:24,922 --> 02:08:33,009
MATT: You see clusters of lemures throughout the
city. As well as low-level spine devils and some

2153
02:08:33,009 --> 02:08:41,710
other fiendish creatures that are in the process
of rebuilding and reconstructing buildings, and

2154
02:08:41,710 --> 02:08:45,457
tearing down others. You start seeing elements of
the city are constantly in a state of being

2155
02:08:45,457 --> 02:08:52,940
restructured, rebuilt. Sometimes more grandiose,
sometimes more awful and terrifying. And you get

2156
02:08:52,940 --> 02:09:00,441
the sense that the city is in a perpetual state of
flux. That gleaming, iron tower still just beyond

2157
02:09:00,441 --> 02:09:06,851
your visual sight whenever you have to readjust
your vision across the horizon. I need you guys to

2158
02:09:06,851 --> 02:09:13,954
all make another stealth check. For these
different steps of the journey.

2159
02:09:13,954 --> 02:09:15,984
TRAVIS: 25.

2160
02:09:15,984 --> 02:09:17,127
MARISHA: 29.

2161
02:09:17,127 --> 02:09:18,427
SAM: 16.

2162
02:09:18,427 --> 02:09:19,586
TRAVIS: With the plus ten?

2163
02:09:19,586 --> 02:09:21,735
SAM: Mm-hm.

2164
02:09:21,735 --> 02:09:23,134
LAURA: 22.

2165
02:09:23,134 --> 02:09:24,485
TALIESIN: Natural one.

2166
02:09:24,485 --> 02:09:26,178
MARISHA: No, Percy!

2167
02:09:26,178 --> 02:09:27,374
TRAVIS: Come on, golden snitch.

2168
02:09:27,374 --> 02:09:28,525
MARISHA: Come on, Freddie.

2169
02:09:28,525 --> 02:09:30,858
TALIESIN: There was something about that coffee
cup being there. There we go.

2170
02:09:30,858 --> 02:09:33,224
LIAM: Can I share some of my 37 with Percy?

2171
02:09:33,224 --> 02:09:38,012
MATT: Doesn't-- So as you guys are moving along,
watching Vasa, Vasa eventually gets out of sight

2172
02:09:38,165 --> 02:09:44,538
for a moment and you all stop and pull back. And
you see a flash of light that signifies Vasa

2173
02:09:44,538 --> 02:09:48,487
calling you forward and that it's safe. And as you
all move forward, you watch as Taryon and Percival

2174
02:09:48,487 --> 02:09:53,793
were both looking behind, keeping watch on your
back, and by the time they look back you guys are

2175
02:09:53,793 --> 02:09:59,436
already about 20 feet ahead. And as they rush
forward, Percival straight up-- His foot hits the

2176
02:09:59,436 --> 02:10:03,256
edge of where two of the iron rifts in the ground,
the plating that meets up this part of the

2177
02:10:03,256 --> 02:10:09,535
alleyway. He stumbles forward, landing hard on his
elbow and giving out a (groan) of his breath. And

2178
02:10:09,535 --> 02:10:15,750
as he does, you hear a (imp sound) and you watch
as a small, impish creature in golden armor begins

2179
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:20,920
to crawl over the roof of the nearby building and
look over the side.

2180
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:24,676
TALIESIN: I turn and break away from the group and
head in a slightly different direction for a

2181
02:10:24,676 --> 02:10:30,522
moment and sit and nurse my elbow, and try and
just look like I'm dealing with my medical issue

2182
02:10:30,522 --> 02:10:34,524
and really try to look like I didn't notice the
thing that's watching me now.

2183
02:10:34,524 --> 02:10:42,813
MATT: Okay. I want you to go and make a deception
check. No, you have to roll if it's intentional.

2184
02:10:42,813 --> 02:10:44,813
(laughter)

2185
02:10:44,813 --> 02:10:47,715
TALIESIN: Meh. Deception?

2186
02:10:47,715 --> 02:10:48,645
MATT: Yeah.

2187
02:10:48,645 --> 02:10:49,789
TALIESIN: Nine.

2188
02:10:49,789 --> 02:10:57,427
MATT: Nine? Okay. So you watch the creature (imp
sounds) and slowly crawls along the top of the

2189
02:10:57,427 --> 02:11:04,037
roof, as you go and split off from the rest of the
party. You hear behind you the (imp talking) some

2190
02:11:04,037 --> 02:11:07,649
sort of conversation, and then a second one
appears. And one continues to follow you, while

2191
02:11:07,649 --> 02:11:10,738
the other one continues to move with Taryon.

2192
02:11:10,738 --> 02:11:12,638
TALIESIN: Do I have any of the soul--

2193
02:11:12,638 --> 02:11:14,919
SAM: Did I see him break off?

2194
02:11:14,919 --> 02:11:18,034
MATT: Yeah, you watch as, after he gets back up,
he breaks off from the rest of the group.

2195
02:11:18,034 --> 02:11:19,429
SAM: I'm going to stick with him.

2196
02:11:19,429 --> 02:11:21,999
MATT: Okay. So you're both now being followed by
two of these--

2197
02:11:21,999 --> 02:11:29,629
TALIESIN: One moment. I'm going to pull out a
piece of the soul, the edible soul, and just about

2198
02:11:29,629 --> 02:11:31,140
to eat it.

2199
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:35,595
LIAM: Do the rest of us see this, by the way?

2200
02:11:35,595 --> 02:11:41,738
MATT: You all just made it past this open walkway
in the street, turned around another alley, and

2201
02:11:41,738 --> 02:11:46,869
you watched this happen across the way. They're
about 15, 20 feet from you, in an open road.

2202
02:11:46,921 --> 02:11:49,945
LIAM: I'm going to quietly follow behind the imps.

2203
02:11:49,945 --> 02:11:54,516
MATT: The imps are on the other side of the road
from you right now. If you want to, you can try in

2204
02:11:54,516 --> 02:11:55,737
a moment.

2205
02:11:55,737 --> 02:11:57,231
LIAM: Oh, never mind.

2206
02:11:57,231 --> 02:12:02,726
TALIESIN: I'm trying something. I've got the shard
of soul out, the soul shard. Giving it a smell.

2207
02:12:02,726 --> 02:12:13,993
And I'm going to, not quite loudly, but with a bit
(disgusted sound) and I'm going to huck it in the

2208
02:12:13,993 --> 02:12:16,252
other direction with distaste.

2209
02:12:16,252 --> 02:12:27,503
MATT: Okay. One of the two imps breaks off and
swoops down after it, and immediately runs over

2210
02:12:27,503 --> 02:12:32,152
and starts scattering across the ground trying to
catch it as it tumbles off of the side. The other

2211
02:12:32,152 --> 02:12:34,697
one continues to follow after the two of you.

2212
02:12:34,697 --> 02:12:38,005
TALIESIN: Can we try and give it the slip?

2213
02:12:38,005 --> 02:12:41,151
SAM: I can try to make us invisible.

2214
02:12:41,151 --> 02:12:42,710
TALIESIN: It won't work.

2215
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:43,993
SAM: It won't work?

2216
02:12:43,993 --> 02:12:46,011
LAURA: They see through invisibility.

2217
02:12:46,011 --> 02:12:47,056
SAM: All right.

2218
02:12:47,056 --> 02:12:49,195
MATT: The bigger ones do.

2219
02:12:49,195 --> 02:12:53,123
LAURA: I thought you said the Whisperers saw
through invisibility?

2220
02:12:53,123 --> 02:12:57,725
MATT: Some of the Whisperers do, some don't. He
said be wary of the bigger ones. They see through

2221
02:12:57,725 --> 02:12:59,815
invisibility and possibly other things.

2222
02:12:59,815 --> 02:13:01,092
LAURA: Okay.

2223
02:13:01,092 --> 02:13:02,706
SAM: What do you think?

2224
02:13:02,706 --> 02:13:09,363
TALIESIN: I'm going to dust myself off and try and
just meander into a shadow. I still have Pass

2225
02:13:09,363 --> 02:13:10,518
Without a Trace.

2226
02:13:10,518 --> 02:13:11,586
MATT: You do, yes.

2227
02:13:11,586 --> 02:13:14,946
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can just vanish
stealthily.

2228
02:13:14,946 --> 02:13:17,654
MATT: Okay. Make it with disadvantage, because you
are being actively watched.

2229
02:13:17,654 --> 02:13:18,891
TALIESIN: I am being actively watched?

2230
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:22,983
MATT: You can turn around the corner and attempt
it, but you know. It is aware that you walked

2231
02:13:22,983 --> 02:13:26,960
there, so your ability to slip out of its view
once you break from its line of sight is going to

2232
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,148
be this check.

2233
02:13:28,148 --> 02:13:35,284
TALIESIN: I'm also going to-- Can I also use my
boots of spider walking to see if I can crawl off

2234
02:13:35,284 --> 02:13:37,293
the street a little bit and see if I can--

2235
02:13:37,293 --> 02:13:39,467
MATT: Sure, let's try it. Go ahead and make your
stealth check.

2236
02:13:39,467 --> 02:13:41,093
TRAVIS: You can certainly try.

2237
02:13:41,093 --> 02:13:47,928
TALIESIN: Disadvantage. I hate disadvantage so
much. That's cocked. It doesn't matter though,

2238
02:13:47,928 --> 02:13:50,642
it's awful. Yeah, never mind, I fail.

2239
02:13:50,642 --> 02:13:55,149
MATT: Okay. So, as you turn around the corner, you
step onto the side of the wall. Hearing the impact

2240
02:13:55,207 --> 02:14:03,214
of the boots across the iron side. Thankfully,
it's enchanted boots, so the damage is relatively

2241
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:09,492
minimal, but you do hear the very faint sizzle of
leather on hot metal. What are you doing, Tary?

2242
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:16,107
SAM: Well. I will cast Invisibility on myself.

2243
02:14:16,107 --> 02:14:17,329
MATT: All right.

2244
02:14:17,329 --> 02:14:20,654
SAM: And that's all I can do for my turn.

2245
02:14:20,654 --> 02:14:24,765
MATT: So as this one is following Percival around
the corner, the one that was going after you, that

2246
02:14:24,765 --> 02:14:29,689
was distracted by the stone, you turn invisible,
and it glances around and has lost sight of you

2247
02:14:29,689 --> 02:14:31,475
for the moment. And it continues to push after
Percival.

2248
02:14:31,475 --> 02:14:36,194
SAM: I'm going to stick with Percival, but in an
invisible way.

2249
02:14:36,194 --> 02:14:40,600
TALIESIN: I'm just-- I'm going to keep talking
over the headphones, trying to keep up with where

2250
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:46,703
everyone else is, but walking off a block, in the
hopes of sort of bullshitting my way through this.

2251
02:14:46,703 --> 02:14:50,941
MATT: As you head down this alleyway, and you guys
are parallel following on the side, watching this

2252
02:14:50,941 --> 02:14:55,841
from a distance, but staying out of sight, without
making yourselves visible. Percival, you look up

2253
02:14:55,841 --> 02:15:00,636
and you see this strange, eerie green glow that
begins to drift in your direction. You watch as

2254
02:15:00,636 --> 02:15:06,821
these spectral arms begin to drift up out of the
ground, and this elongated horrifying face pulls

2255
02:15:06,821 --> 02:15:14,600
up from underneath the darkened cobblestones of
the street. And this specter entity

2256
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:16,477
drifts in your direction.

2257
02:15:16,477 --> 02:15:20,029
TALIESIN: Do I recognize what this specter entity
is?

2258
02:15:20,029 --> 02:15:26,146
MATT: It's some sort of a ghost-like creature.
You've seen a number of these emanating and

2259
02:15:26,146 --> 02:15:29,254
drifting through the city, some in small clusters,
some individually.

2260
02:15:29,254 --> 02:15:31,925
They seem to wander aimlessly throughout.

2261
02:15:31,925 --> 02:15:41,674
SAM: I am whispering the incantation for
Invisibility into a coin.

2262
02:15:41,674 --> 02:15:45,496
MATT: Okay. That takes a minute to do it.

2263
02:15:45,496 --> 02:15:48,487
SAM: It does? Fuck. Then I'm not doing it.

2264
02:15:48,487 --> 02:15:52,439
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and keep pace with that
thing. Is it following me?

2265
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:57,226
MATT: You glance over your shoulder and see it and
it is currently crawled around the side and it's

2266
02:15:57,226 --> 02:16:04,319
leaping from these windowsills, these small iron
squares that are about that big, that are built

2267
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:09,300
into the side of these walls here. It's leaping
and flying from section to section, staying

2268
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,840
immediately 15 feet, 20 feet behind you.

2269
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,992
LIAM: Can I trail this thing?

2270
02:16:13,992 --> 02:16:15,613
MATT: Do you want to go and follow?

2271
02:16:15,613 --> 02:16:18,488
SAM: You said 20 feet behind us?

2272
02:16:18,488 --> 02:16:20,121
MATT: It's about 20 feet behind you, yeah.

2273
02:16:20,121 --> 02:16:21,188
SAM: And up?

2274
02:16:21,188 --> 02:16:22,656
MATT: Yeah, about 15 feet up.

2275
02:16:22,656 --> 02:16:29,377
SAM: All right, I'm going to reach into my
alchemist's satchel and pull out a bag of writhing

2276
02:16:29,377 --> 02:16:32,969
sticky black tar and hurl it right at his feet.

2277
02:16:32,969 --> 02:16:39,586
MATT; Okay. It's leaping from windowsill to
windowsill, and as it gets to one windowsill you

2278
02:16:39,586 --> 02:16:40,730
chuck at it?

2279
02:16:40,730 --> 02:16:41,497
SAM: Yeah.

2280
02:16:41,497 --> 02:16:43,479
MATT: All right, go for it, roll for an attack.

2281
02:16:43,479 --> 02:16:48,389
SAM: What is this, plus my spell attack bonus? No,
it's just an attack? What is this?

2282
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:51,430
MATT: It should say under your ability here. I'll
pull it up if you want.

2283
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:54,999
SAM: Am I rolling for the throw, or for the
spell?

2284
02:16:54,999 --> 02:16:57,630
MATT: This is for the throw. Or, is it the
creature's saving throw, which is it? Which of the

2285
02:16:57,630 --> 02:16:59,720
two? Let me go look, actually.

2286
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:04,048
TALIESIN: I just had five of the worst rolls I've
ever had in a row. That was just ugly. There was

2287
02:17:04,048 --> 02:17:08,877
just ugliness happening, and I don't feel it's
gone yet. It's not the dice, it's in me.

2288
02:17:08,877 --> 02:17:10,463
MATT: This is the tanglefoot bag?

2289
02:17:10,463 --> 02:17:13,261
MARISHA: That's what happens when you sell out,
man.

2290
02:17:13,261 --> 02:17:16,930
TALIESIN: Shut up.

2291
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:22,671
MATT: So what you do is, it splats against it, and
you watch it (choking noise), it gets stuck and

2292
02:17:22,671 --> 02:17:26,938
sapped into it. It's moving now at half pace, it's
having to pull through this substance that's glued

2293
02:17:26,938 --> 02:17:29,541
to its feet and it's trying to tear away.

2294
02:17:29,541 --> 02:17:31,558
SAM: Okay.

2295
02:17:31,558 --> 02:17:32,705
MATT: All right.

2296
02:17:32,705 --> 02:17:33,924
SAM: That's all I got.

2297
02:17:33,924 --> 02:17:35,780
LIAM: I got a 46 on stealth, can I--

2298
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:42,492
MATT: You turn around the corner now and you see,
first off, Taryon appears, because when you throw

2299
02:17:42,492 --> 02:17:43,711
the bag it breaks your invisibility.

2300
02:17:43,711 --> 02:17:44,594
SAM: It's an attack?

2301
02:17:44,594 --> 02:17:45,455
MATT: Yeah.

2302
02:17:45,455 --> 02:17:46,685
SAM: Shit. Okay, it's worth it.

2303
02:17:46,685 --> 02:17:54,863
MATT: So now you see Percival and Taryon both
appear, and this one impish creature is now

2304
02:17:54,863 --> 02:17:59,347
currently partially glued to a wall and is
fighting, trying to pull its way out.

2305
02:17:59,347 --> 02:18:00,477
SAM: Let's run!

2306
02:18:00,477 --> 02:18:03,853
LIAM: It looks like a target. Whisper.

2307
02:18:03,853 --> 02:18:05,199
MATT: Okay.

2308
02:18:05,199 --> 02:18:06,720
LIAM: With a 46 stealth.

2309
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,458
MATT: Yeah. So go ahead and roll.

2310
02:18:08,458 --> 02:18:09,605
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2311
02:18:09,605 --> 02:18:11,566
LIAM: Would this be a surprise, if I'm that
stealthed?

2312
02:18:11,566 --> 02:18:15,893
MATT: No. It is aware that there are threats in
its vicinity, so it's not a surprise attack. But

2313
02:18:15,893 --> 02:18:18,043
it does not see you, so you have advantage on the
attack. It is considered a

2314
02:18:18,043 --> 02:18:19,756
Sneak Attack if you hit it.

2315
02:18:19,756 --> 02:18:25,395
LIAM: 25 to hit.

2316
02:18:25,395 --> 02:18:27,091
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

2317
02:18:27,091 --> 02:18:36,767
LIAM: All right. 12, and I will do a second attack
as well.

2318
02:18:36,767 --> 02:18:39,014
MATT: How much damage is the first attack?

2319
02:18:39,014 --> 02:18:40,069
LIAM: 12.

2320
02:18:40,069 --> 02:18:42,402
MATT: 12 damage? It's Sneak Attack, because it
didn't see you.

2321
02:18:42,402 --> 02:19:01,628
LIAM: Oh wait no, it is Sneak Attack, right?
Thanks. 12, 25, 27, 33, 35, 42, plus psychic

2322
02:19:01,628 --> 02:19:05,302
damage from that, 42, so 45.

2323
02:19:05,302 --> 02:19:11,017
MATT: So right as it's pulling away from this
tanglefoot bag, this explosion of glue, it's like

2324
02:19:11,017 --> 02:19:16,008
(rasping noise), and the dagger just slips through
it, and you watch as it goes in four different

2325
02:19:16,008 --> 02:19:22,694
pieces and retracts into the tanglefoot bag muck
once more. It got completely shredded, and the

2326
02:19:22,694 --> 02:19:27,930
sections are withdrawn back and stuck to it as it
is slowly now dribbling out of this massive glue

2327
02:19:27,930 --> 02:19:31,062
on the side of the building, which is now starting to
bubble from the heat

2328
02:19:31,062 --> 02:19:32,735
from the side of this structure.

2329
02:19:32,787 --> 02:19:35,045
ALL: Tar pits.

2330
02:19:35,045 --> 02:19:38,448
TALIESIN: I'm going to take this opportunity to
try and turn another corner.

2331
02:19:38,448 --> 02:19:44,715
MATT: Okay. The impish creature that was
distracted by your stone is now attempting to

2332
02:19:44,715 --> 02:19:47,265
catch up. I want the three of you to make one more
stealth check, since

2333
02:19:47,265 --> 02:19:48,437
you've all revealed yourselves.

2334
02:19:48,437 --> 02:19:54,441
MARISHA: Come on! Don't fuck up, Percy! Don't fuck
up! It's all right.

2335
02:19:54,441 --> 02:19:55,681
TALIESIN: 23!

2336
02:19:55,681 --> 02:19:57,265
SAM: 24.

2337
02:19:57,265 --> 02:19:58,591
LIAM: 37.

2338
02:19:58,591 --> 02:20:02,987
MATT: Okay. You guys, darting into the shadows,
rush around the corner. You hear in the distance

2339
02:20:02,987 --> 02:20:11,376
the clattering of tiny imp claws, and the impacts
of it doing the same perch-to-perch, gliding

2340
02:20:11,376 --> 02:20:17,261
through the alleyway. You turn the corner and join
up with the rest of the party. You hear in the

2341
02:20:17,261 --> 02:20:20,788
distance some sort of a distant barking call in
the language you don't understand.

2342
02:20:20,788 --> 02:20:23,767
TRAVIS: Oh, like raptors.

2343
02:20:23,767 --> 02:20:25,325
MARISHA: I was going to say, Jurassic Park.

2344
02:20:25,325 --> 02:20:26,897
LAURA: They're going to be the lookout now.

2345
02:20:26,897 --> 02:20:32,046
MATT: You gather that they've acknowledged that
there has been a Whisperer slain in the alley, so

2346
02:20:32,046 --> 02:20:33,076
you might want to hurry.

2347
02:20:33,076 --> 02:20:34,244
ALL: Yeah.

2348
02:20:34,244 --> 02:20:40,529
MATT: As you guys collectively catch up with Vasa
and are led further into the city, you begin to

2349
02:20:40,529 --> 02:20:47,388
hear now this horrible grinding sound of metal
that becomes omnipresent farther down this

2350
02:20:47,388 --> 02:20:55,525
labyrinthine network of alleys and streets. You
can see the glow of red and orange, that

2351
02:20:55,525 --> 02:21:03,305
previously just emanated from the horizon, is now
beginning to light the sky around you. It's this

2352
02:21:03,305 --> 02:21:09,095
light pollution from some sort of nearby source.
As you turn one of the corners, you look and see

2353
02:21:09,095 --> 02:21:19,923
giant pyres of molten metal and fire. There is a
gargantuan forge where people are-- I say people,

2354
02:21:19,923 --> 02:21:27,219
these devilish entities-- and hundreds of lemures
are just heaping large bits of iron ingots and

2355
02:21:27,219 --> 02:21:33,307
scrap metal from fallen buildings and tossing them
into this forge. Every time they do, there's a

2356
02:21:33,307 --> 02:21:41,278
burst of flame and ash and cinder come pouring out
of it. From there, you can see refined metals

2357
02:21:41,278 --> 02:21:45,823
being pulled out and brought to other elements of
this city. Beyond that, as you glance over, you

2358
02:21:45,823 --> 02:21:52,223
can hear this faint echoing sound of hundreds upon
hundreds of voices, all moaning, screaming,

2359
02:21:52,223 --> 02:21:58,530
squealing, in torturous pain. You don't have a
view of what's causing it, but this whole area of

2360
02:21:58,530 --> 02:22:05,939
this city just brings this terrifying presence of
all the torment you'd expect from somewhere in the

2361
02:22:05,939 --> 02:22:13,460
Hells. As you pause a moment, Vasa darts back,
trying to usher you forward in the direction of

2362
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:19,111
the sound. "Come, come, follow." And then vanishes
once again, appearing on the other side of the

2363
02:22:19,111 --> 02:22:22,883
street, and then beckoning you once more. For the
last leg, I need everyone to make

2364
02:22:22,883 --> 02:22:24,894
one more stealth check.

2365
02:22:24,894 --> 02:22:26,905
TRAVIS: Come on, Percy, for fuck's sake.

2366
02:22:26,905 --> 02:22:28,176
MARISHA: All of us?

2367
02:22:28,176 --> 02:22:29,594
MATT: All of you.

2368
02:22:29,594 --> 02:22:30,802
TALIESIN: Better.

2369
02:22:30,802 --> 02:22:33,236
SAM: 22.

2370
02:22:33,236 --> 02:22:34,464
TRAVIS: 23.

2371
02:22:34,464 --> 02:22:35,939
MARISHA: 34.

2372
02:22:35,939 --> 02:22:37,662
TALIESIN: 27.

2373
02:22:37,662 --> 02:22:38,753
LAURA: 26.

2374
02:22:38,753 --> 02:22:40,112
LIAM: 37.

2375
02:22:40,112 --> 02:22:47,067
MATT: Okay. As you're waiting for the right moment
to cross the street, you wait for one cluster of

2376
02:22:47,067 --> 02:22:52,066
these tiny winged, not quite imps, they're a
little larger than imps, with this dark

2377
02:22:52,066 --> 02:23:00,643
bluish-green spine protrusions out of the wings,
and their heads are these giant bony ridges that

2378
02:23:00,643 --> 02:23:06,741
go back, and they have these long spears. And
about two dozen of them come down this street in a

2379
02:23:06,741 --> 02:23:12,836
vast cluster, almost like a bat storm, a whole
bunch of just randomly flying and angrily

2380
02:23:12,836 --> 02:23:17,595
screeching creatures. And as you wait for that to
pass, the minute that sound goes past, you dart

2381
02:23:17,595 --> 02:23:22,823
across the alleyway and make it to the other side
and turn just in time for the large heavy

2382
02:23:22,823 --> 02:23:31,355
footfalls of what looks to be some sort of
monstrosity. Multiple arms that are stitched to

2383
02:23:31,355 --> 02:23:37,747
this large golem-like creature. It's humanoid, but
it's about 15 feet tall, and it's just covered in

2384
02:23:37,747 --> 02:23:45,697
stitches. Multiple chunks of different faces that
are all just sewn together in places. You can see

2385
02:23:45,697 --> 02:23:49,841
this series of gems that are imbedded in its
shoulders and part of its throat that all pulse,

2386
02:23:49,841 --> 02:23:54,152
like separate heartbeats that are out of pace with
each other, and as it stumbles forward you see a

2387
02:23:54,152 --> 02:23:58,162
chain around its neck and it's being dragged by
this tiny imp that's just pulling it forward and

2388
02:23:58,162 --> 02:24:03,497
tugging on it. It doesn't even make much of a
noise other than a perpetual gurgle, but it's just

2389
02:24:03,497 --> 02:24:10,468
some sort of flesh-stitched automaton that's being
dragged forward to its next physical activity at

2390
02:24:10,468 --> 02:24:13,434
the behest of whoever owns it.

2391
02:24:13,434 --> 02:24:16,515
LAURA: Freddie, you can't end up here.

2392
02:24:16,515 --> 02:24:19,230
TALIESIN: No.

2393
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:30,005
MATT: A few moments later, Vasa brings you to the
outside of a large jet-black metallic and stone

2394
02:24:30,005 --> 02:24:40,137
structure. A heavy thick-walled stronghold with a
series of what looks like-- imagine a thick

2395
02:24:40,137 --> 02:24:46,453
bramble forest made of twisted iron that surrounds
the base of it, about five feet high. There are

2396
02:24:46,453 --> 02:24:52,125
small gaps where you guys can try and squeeze
through, for the more lithe folk. Grog, you're not

2397
02:24:52,125 --> 02:24:57,965
quite sure how you're going to get over this
without tearing bits of you apart. There's about a

2398
02:24:57,965 --> 02:25:04,633
ten foot gap between this strange metal bramble
fence, and the outside of this stronghold.

2399
02:25:04,633 --> 02:25:15,087
LAURA: After I go through, stay here. I pop
Trinket out, and then I reach my necklace through

2400
02:25:15,087 --> 02:25:17,585
and say, get in.

2401
02:25:17,585 --> 02:25:19,286
TRAVIS: Okay.

2402
02:25:19,286 --> 02:25:21,853
MATT: Grog, you get inside. You release him out on
the other side.

2403
02:25:21,853 --> 02:25:23,028
LAURA: I put Trinket back in.

2404
02:25:23,028 --> 02:25:24,208
MATT: All right. Well done.

2405
02:25:24,208 --> 02:25:26,475
TRAVIS: Whoa. That was easier than I thought.

2406
02:25:26,475 --> 02:25:31,400
MATT: At which point you now have Doty on the
other side just going (smashing noises).

2407
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:33,503
TRAVIS: You can put Doty in there. I farted while
I was inside.

2408
02:25:33,503 --> 02:25:36,195
LAURA: I don't think Doty can go in there, it's
only for living creatures. I can try.

2409
02:25:36,195 --> 02:25:41,796
Get in, Doty.

2410
02:25:41,796 --> 02:25:43,688
TALIESIN: Tell Doty to get in.

2411
02:25:43,688 --> 02:25:44,675
MATT: No effect.

2412
02:25:44,675 --> 02:25:45,819
LAURA: Nothing?

2413
02:25:45,819 --> 02:25:47,745
TALIESIN: Tell Doty to get in, maybe.

2414
02:25:47,745 --> 02:25:49,862
SAM: Doty, try your best to get in.

2415
02:25:52,382 --> 02:25:54,342
LAURA: No, no, no.

2416
02:25:54,342 --> 02:25:58,970
SAM: It's fine. I'll cast Fly on Doty.

2417
02:25:58,970 --> 02:26:01,800
LAURA: Don't you think that's going to be
noticeable?

2418
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,922
SAM: How high up is it?

2419
02:26:03,922 --> 02:26:05,011
TRAVIS: It's only five feet high.

2420
02:26:05,011 --> 02:26:09,090
SAM: Wait, don't we have a magic carpet or
something?

2421
02:26:09,090 --> 02:26:11,028
LAURA: Yeah, but we're trying to be stealthy.

2422
02:26:11,028 --> 02:26:14,604
SAM: Stealthy. With a robot.

2423
02:26:14,604 --> 02:26:17,408
LIAM: He can just edge along the top of the iron,
yeah?

2424
02:26:17,408 --> 02:26:21,045
MATT: You guys have been good enough to keep far
enough ahead that this wandering metallic

2425
02:26:21,045 --> 02:26:26,703
automaton about 25 feet behind you hasn't drawn
any strange attention. Yet.

2426
02:26:26,703 --> 02:26:33,697
MARISHA: Are there fissures? Steam vents?

2427
02:26:33,697 --> 02:26:39,652
MATT: No steam vents that you can see, it's just
this tangled mass of thick metal cables, maybe

2428
02:26:39,652 --> 02:26:44,248
about a foot thick, that have spikes jutting out
of them. It's climbable, but there may be some

2429
02:26:44,248 --> 02:26:46,841
damage taken in the process.

2430
02:26:46,841 --> 02:26:49,138
LAURA: He said take the easiest way in.

2431
02:26:49,138 --> 02:26:50,185
SAM: He said that?

2432
02:26:50,185 --> 02:26:50,945
LAURA: Yeah.

2433
02:26:50,945 --> 02:26:51,870
TALIESIN: Yes.

2434
02:26:51,870 --> 02:26:54,891
SAM: Well then, Doty, go straight through.

2435
02:26:54,891 --> 02:27:05,890
MATT: Doty then reaches out and (metal noises) and
it takes a few moments but Doty begins to actually

2436
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:09,840
force the brambles apart and you can see bits of
the metal (clinking) and bits of the spikes

2437
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:14,025
jutting through and breaking parts of the armor
from the opposite side and are piercing it. It

2438
02:27:14,025 --> 02:27:19,178
does manage to pull enough of an opening where
Doty squeezes through and gets to the other side.

2439
02:27:19,178 --> 02:27:30,480
However, Doty does suffer 12 points of piercing
damage in the process, but emerges.

2440
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:33,806
SAM: You're so badass, Doty. Good job.

2441
02:27:33,806 --> 02:27:36,478
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should bend them back?

2442
02:27:36,478 --> 02:27:39,966
MARISHA: Yeah, how noticeable is the bent bars?

2443
02:27:39,966 --> 02:27:42,551
MATT: It's pretty noticeable, it's about that big
around.

2444
02:27:42,551 --> 02:27:44,113
TALIESIN: Can Doty put it back?

2445
02:27:44,113 --> 02:27:45,470
LIAM: Is it Doty-shaped?

2446
02:27:45,470 --> 02:27:46,525
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

2447
02:27:46,525 --> 02:27:47,618
MARISHA: Go, Grog.

2448
02:27:47,618 --> 02:27:49,833
MATT: Roll a strength check.

2449
02:27:49,833 --> 02:27:55,514
TRAVIS: 15.

2450
02:27:55,514 --> 02:28:01,661
MATT: It takes you a little bit of time, and you
manage to squeeze it together.

2451
02:28:01,661 --> 02:28:03,929
LAURA: Plus you put the gauntlets on, which are
good for structures, right?

2452
02:28:03,929 --> 02:28:07,471
MATT: You do take three points of piercing damage.
That's essentially why he's able to do it on a

2453
02:28:07,471 --> 02:28:11,595
roll of 15, because of his Siege ability. You do
manage to squeeze it back together

2454
02:28:11,595 --> 02:28:12,750
and close the hole.

2455
02:28:12,750 --> 02:28:13,825
TRAVIS: Nice.

2456
02:28:13,825 --> 02:28:15,135
TALIESIN: Magic carpentry.

2457
02:28:15,135 --> 02:28:22,965
MATT: Now, Vasa you see is now up on the side of
this wall, and this stronghold has nearly no

2458
02:28:22,965 --> 02:28:27,750
openings on any other side. However, there is a
small sliver of an opening, it's almost like an

2459
02:28:27,750 --> 02:28:32,194
exhaust on the higher end there, and Vasa is
currently perched up onto it.

2460
02:28:32,230 --> 02:28:34,557
SAM: How high?

2461
02:28:34,729 --> 02:28:36,982
MATT: About seven feet up.

2462
02:28:36,982 --> 02:28:40,550
SAM: And how wide is this door?

2463
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:44,692
MATT: It's about a foot and a half high and about
two and a half, three feet wide.

2464
02:28:44,692 --> 02:28:46,472
LAURA: Great.

2465
02:28:46,472 --> 02:28:48,336
SAM: We want to get into this place, right?

2466
02:28:48,336 --> 02:28:49,505
LAURA: Yeah.

2467
02:28:49,505 --> 02:28:59,287
SAM: Well then, let's have a door. And I will
pull my A Door out of my Robe of Useful Items and

2468
02:28:59,457 --> 02:29:01,599
it put it on the side of the wall.

2469
02:29:01,599 --> 02:29:03,295
TRAVIS: You do what?

2470
02:29:03,295 --> 02:29:08,993
MATT: He pulls a patch out off of his robe and
tears it off and slams it against the stone. As it

2471
02:29:08,993 --> 02:29:15,870
does, you watch as, what was once solid black
metal, a tiny seam of orange appears in a large

2472
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:21,329
rectangular pattern, and then opens ever so
slightly on a hinge that

2473
02:29:21,329 --> 02:29:22,874
wasn't there before.

2474
02:29:22,874 --> 02:29:24,121
SAM: After you.

2475
02:29:24,121 --> 02:29:25,826
TALIESIN: Well, that's my kind of ridiculous.

2476
02:29:25,826 --> 02:29:28,289
LIAM: He's not the hero we wanted, but he's the
hero we need.

2477
02:29:28,289 --> 02:29:30,542
(laughter)

2478
02:29:30,542 --> 02:29:35,589
SAM: This door cost a lot of money, just so you
know.

2479
02:29:35,589 --> 02:29:37,279
LAURA: Good to know.

2480
02:29:37,279 --> 02:29:45,358
MATT: As you guys peer inside, ever so carefully,
do you guys want to--

2481
02:29:45,358 --> 02:29:47,681
LAURA: Very carefully, I want to just peek in.

2482
02:29:47,681 --> 02:29:49,387
MATT: Make a perception check.

2483
02:29:49,387 --> 02:29:51,694
MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace
on?

2484
02:29:51,694 --> 02:29:52,682
MATT AND LAURA: Yeah.

2485
02:29:52,682 --> 02:29:55,589
LAURA: Ah! Nah, I don't see shit.

2486
02:29:55,589 --> 02:30:00,300
MATT: It is very dark inside, there's a faint bit
of almost like candlelight out of view, you can

2487
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:04,771
see there's a shifting glow internally that seems
to have a life of a small flame.

2488
02:30:04,959 --> 02:30:09,153
LIAM: I gently push my sister to the side and try
the same.

2489
02:30:09,153 --> 02:30:10,918
MATT: Make a perception check.

2490
02:30:10,918 --> 02:30:14,403
LIAM: Yeah. 24.

2491
02:30:14,403 --> 02:30:21,106
MATT: Okay. As you glance inside of it, you can
see there's a series of chains dangling from the

2492
02:30:21,106 --> 02:30:29,480
ceiling carrying hooks on them. A number of these
hooks seem to have a dried reddish caked

2493
02:30:29,480 --> 02:30:37,600
blood-like material, some of them have bits of
flesh still stripped and dangling from them. There

2494
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:44,717
are two tables in this chamber, each table
seemingly containing some sort of a humanoid body

2495
02:30:44,717 --> 02:30:50,952
that is placed on it and strapped down. One
appears to be in two pieces. There is a torso and

2496
02:30:50,952 --> 02:30:55,388
there are legs, and the center piece that once
held the parts together is nowhere near in sight.

2497
02:30:55,388 --> 02:30:59,719
Too shadowed to make any details from this angle,
as you've just peered past the door, but there

2498
02:30:59,719 --> 02:31:04,262
does not appear to be any other moving or living
creature in the chamber that you can see.

2499
02:31:04,262 --> 02:31:08,652
LIAM: So none of those forms are moving,
breathing, anything, as far as I can tell.

2500
02:31:08,652 --> 02:31:09,901
MATT: As far as you can tell.

2501
02:31:09,901 --> 02:31:10,987
LIAM: Yeah.

2502
02:31:10,987 --> 02:31:15,117
MATT: You take a moment longer and you see the one
on the far table is breathing.

2503
02:31:15,117 --> 02:31:22,872
LIAM: All right. We have some deadish things in
here, kind of moving--

2504
02:31:22,872 --> 02:31:26,631
LAURA: Dangerous things, or--

2505
02:31:26,631 --> 02:31:33,533
LIAM: It looks like it. I'd like to go in and get
a closer look. Is everybody cool with that?

2506
02:31:33,533 --> 02:31:36,785
MATT: All right, roll a stealth check.

2507
02:31:36,785 --> 02:31:43,075
LIAM: That's fine. That's 40 with the Pass Without
a Trace.

2508
02:31:43,075 --> 02:31:48,101
MATT: Okay. As you slowly slip into the chamber,
closing the door ever so slightly to make just the

2509
02:31:48,101 --> 02:31:53,955
faintest creaking of metal on metal, you slip into
the chamber, and you can see there's shelves with

2510
02:31:53,955 --> 02:31:58,724
various torture instruments just strewn across it.
It looks like a terrible nightmare version of

2511
02:31:58,724 --> 02:32:10,113
Percy's work chamber back in Greyskull Keep. There
are two doors in the room, one on the north side

2512
02:32:10,113 --> 02:32:17,479
and one on the eastern side, and the body that's
on one table you can see appears to be human,

2513
02:32:17,479 --> 02:32:24,627
older male. There are signs of some sort of
physical scarring on the body, whether it be

2514
02:32:24,627 --> 02:32:34,095
necromantic or corruption-based, it has been long
dead. There is a very strong smell of decay. The

2515
02:32:34,095 --> 02:32:42,737
other table, you do see the slight moving chest of
a living dwarf, a female dwarf that appears to be

2516
02:32:42,737 --> 02:32:51,722
passed out, unconscious, and has suffered quite a
bit of torturous wounds. You can see hundreds of

2517
02:32:51,722 --> 02:33:01,152
small scratches and jagged dagger wounds in the
side of the shoulders and arms, the face, and is

2518
02:33:01,152 --> 02:33:03,528
currently strapped down to the table.

2519
02:33:03,528 --> 02:33:09,541
LIAM: I'm going to use Divine Sense in this room.
Am I within 50, 60 feet of that dwarf?

2520
02:33:09,541 --> 02:33:11,156
MATT: You are, yes.

2521
02:33:11,156 --> 02:33:12,914
LIAM: Yeah, Divine Sense.

2522
02:33:12,914 --> 02:33:15,857
MATT: Divine Sense, to sense--

2523
02:33:15,857 --> 02:33:19,506
LIAM: Presence of strong evil registers on my
senses.

2524
02:33:19,506 --> 02:33:34,261
MATT: Within 60 feet of you. All right. Nothing
coming from that dwarf, but there are a number of

2525
02:33:34,261 --> 02:33:41,475
other sources throughout the fortress. Not in the
room, but within 60 feet of you, you get a view of

2526
02:33:41,475 --> 02:33:47,624
the chamber to the north of you and a chamber to
the east of you. The eastern chamber, nothing. The

2527
02:33:47,624 --> 02:33:50,594
chamber to the north of you, just beyond that
door, there is a signature.

2528
02:33:50,594 --> 02:33:55,375
LIAM: And the dwarf appears alive?

2529
02:33:55,375 --> 02:33:56,625
MATT: Yes.

2530
02:33:56,625 --> 02:34:10,116
LIAM: Yeah. There's a woman dwarf in the room
ahead of us.

2531
02:34:10,116 --> 02:34:11,923
LAURA: Is she dangerous?

2532
02:34:11,923 --> 02:34:18,784
LIAM: Hard to say, I don't think so, but I don't
know.

2533
02:34:18,784 --> 02:34:21,163
MARISHA: Does she look familiar?

2534
02:34:21,163 --> 02:34:23,192
SAM: Why don't we go in and look?

2535
02:34:23,192 --> 02:34:30,592
MATT: You guys all quietly make your way into the
chambers.

2536
02:34:30,592 --> 02:34:32,366
LAURA: So quietly.

2537
02:34:32,366 --> 02:34:34,671
LIAM: I'm going to inch ahead of everybody.

2538
02:34:34,671 --> 02:34:36,040
MATT: Okay.

2539
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:38,739
TRAVIS: Does she look like she regrets her
decisions in life?

2540
02:34:38,739 --> 02:34:42,447
LAURA: Does she look like she belongs here? Is she
naked?

2541
02:34:42,447 --> 02:34:44,510
SAM: Does she have any unfortunate tattoos?

2542
02:34:44,510 --> 02:34:49,047
MATT: She's not naked, she's wearing basic cloth
clothing, but a lot of it has been torn and soaked

2543
02:34:49,047 --> 02:34:58,939
deep, deep crimson with blood. A lot of it appears
to be torn from stress and tension. There are claw

2544
02:34:58,939 --> 02:35:05,546
marks from all over this chamber, from various
demonic entities that have torn through here, but

2545
02:35:05,546 --> 02:35:07,380
the table she's on as well.

2546
02:35:07,380 --> 02:35:08,478
LAURA: I go join my brother.

2547
02:35:08,478 --> 02:35:10,142
TALIESIN: I think this is a brilliant
opportunity.

2548
02:35:10,142 --> 02:35:16,025
LIAM: I mean, she's not melted, like the poor
shits we've seen all over this city.

2549
02:35:16,025 --> 02:35:18,827
MATT: The body suddenly stirs on the table.

2550
02:35:18,827 --> 02:35:19,947
SAM: Hello.

2551
02:35:19,947 --> 02:35:23,189
LAURA: Are you awake?

2552
02:35:23,189 --> 02:35:25,481
MATT: Noelle, if you want to step on in?

2553
02:35:25,481 --> 02:35:28,127
TALIESIN: What?

2554
02:35:28,127 --> 02:35:29,537
TRAVIS: Oh no!

2555
02:35:29,537 --> 02:35:30,816
LAURA: Oh shit!

2556
02:35:30,816 --> 02:35:32,932
(laughter)

2557
02:35:32,932 --> 02:35:38,148
SAM: That just took, like, ten minutes to find
her.

2558
02:35:38,148 --> 02:35:40,040
TRAVIS: Come on in, come on in!

2559
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:43,057
TALIESIN: Before we do this, can we have a
ten-minute discussion about whether or not to--

2560
02:35:43,057 --> 02:35:45,114
LAURA: You've been sitting there this whole damn
time?

2561
02:35:45,114 --> 02:35:46,934
NOELLE: Oh no, you guys were shopping, I get it.

2562
02:35:46,934 --> 02:35:49,729
(laughter)

2563
02:35:49,729 --> 02:35:51,504
SAM: Already sass!

2564
02:35:51,504 --> 02:35:55,524
NOELLE: It was just some light torture.

2565
02:35:55,524 --> 02:36:00,812
LAURA: Oh shit, what if she wouldn't have been
tortured if we'd gotten here earlier?

2566
02:36:00,868 --> 02:36:05,815
SAM: By the way, for any future guests who want to
come on the show, we don't normally treat our

2567
02:36:05,815 --> 02:36:06,902
guests this way.

2568
02:36:06,902 --> 02:36:08,972
TALIESIN: There's actually three more guests still
waiting in line.

2569
02:36:08,972 --> 02:36:11,053
SAM: They've been here for weeks!

2570
02:36:11,053 --> 02:36:15,366
NOELLE: It was horrible.

2571
02:36:15,366 --> 02:36:22,102
MATT: You hear a noise, and as you come to in the
darkened room with just the faint glow of the

2572
02:36:22,102 --> 02:36:27,949
candelabra in the corner. You glance over a dart
and you see a series of shapes filtering in from a

2573
02:36:27,949 --> 02:36:32,471
door that you haven't noticed before in the
chamber, and begin whispering to each other and

2574
02:36:32,471 --> 02:36:39,692
then looking over to you occasionally. One of them
suddenly goes "Hello," and the rest go "shh."

2575
02:36:39,692 --> 02:36:42,324
LAURA: Are you alive?

2576
02:36:42,324 --> 02:36:43,440
SAM: Hello!

2577
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:47,363
NOELLE: I just sigh heavily and I go, who the fuck
are you?

2578
02:36:47,363 --> 02:36:57,250
TALIESIN: I'm going to gingerly go over and very
quietly say: we are a remarkable opportunity if

2579
02:36:57,250 --> 02:37:04,907
you're willing to be quiet and maybe have a little
faith in the truth in this very dark place.

2580
02:37:04,907 --> 02:37:06,213
NOELLE: Okay.

2581
02:37:06,213 --> 02:37:07,882
(laughter)

2582
02:37:07,882 --> 02:37:11,168
SAM: She's bleeding from her eyes.

2583
02:37:11,168 --> 02:37:15,332
MATT: As you get a close look at her, too, you see
she has darker auburn red hair with a shock of

2584
02:37:15,398 --> 02:37:25,152
white-gray in it, shaved on the sides, one gnarled
ear that has been chewed and torn and a series of

2585
02:37:25,152 --> 02:37:29,217
scratch scars across the front of her face.

2586
02:37:29,397 --> 02:37:32,146
SAM: I will grab a healing draught and offer it.

2587
02:37:32,146 --> 02:37:34,212
LAURA: I can cast Cure Wounds on her.

2588
02:37:34,212 --> 02:37:36,263
TRAVIS: Let's not fight, just heal her.

2589
02:37:36,263 --> 02:37:38,444
LAURA: I just want to know if it's safe to heal
her.

2590
02:37:38,444 --> 02:37:39,492
TALIESIN: Heal her.

2591
02:37:39,492 --> 02:37:41,216
LAURA: How did you get here?

2592
02:37:41,216 --> 02:37:46,214
NOELLE: That's a pretty long story.

2593
02:37:46,214 --> 02:37:48,195
SAM: We've got nothing but time.

2594
02:37:48,195 --> 02:37:50,313
(laughter)

2595
02:37:50,313 --> 02:37:51,945
LAURA: Is it safe to release you?

2596
02:37:51,945 --> 02:37:55,662
NOELLE: Yes. Can I get off this table, please?
What are we doing?

2597
02:37:55,662 --> 02:37:57,288
SAM: Is she lashed to it?

2598
02:37:57,288 --> 02:38:00,993
MATT: She is manacled to it. Both ankles and
wrists are manacled to this table.

2599
02:38:00,993 --> 02:38:02,934
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on her.

2600
02:38:02,934 --> 02:38:05,289
LIAM: Are the manacles trapped at all? I'm going
to check for traps.

2601
02:38:05,289 --> 02:38:07,742
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2602
02:38:07,742 --> 02:38:08,953
LIAM: Really high.

2603
02:38:08,953 --> 02:38:12,772
LAURA: Let's make a deal. We let you go, you don't
let anyone know we're here,

2604
02:38:12,772 --> 02:38:14,603
and you don't try to kill us.

2605
02:38:14,603 --> 02:38:16,046
NOELLE: Okay.

2606
02:38:16,046 --> 02:38:18,556
LAURA: Can I insight check her?

2607
02:38:18,556 --> 02:38:20,410
MATT: Yeah.

2608
02:38:20,410 --> 02:38:25,436
LAURA: Oh, I got the worst insight ever into her. Ten.

2609
02:38:25,503 --> 02:38:30,660
TRAVIS: I'll do it. 12.

2610
02:38:30,711 --> 02:38:32,315
LAURA: She seems really honest.

2611
02:38:32,315 --> 02:38:33,417
MATT: What did you get?

2612
02:38:33,417 --> 02:38:34,378
LAURA: Ten.

2613
02:38:34,378 --> 02:38:38,501
MATT: She's hard to read. She seems brusque and,
honestly, chained to a table

2614
02:38:38,501 --> 02:38:40,971
and probably tortured.

2615
02:38:40,971 --> 02:38:42,251
NOELLE: The blood doesn't help.

2616
02:38:42,251 --> 02:38:43,229
MATT: Yeah.

2617
02:38:43,229 --> 02:38:49,743
LAURA: I'll cast Cure Wounds at third level.

2618
02:38:49,743 --> 02:38:53,623
SAM: Nothing you can do is as powerful as what I
was about to give her.

2619
02:38:53,623 --> 02:38:54,549
LAURA: Oh, really?

2620
02:38:54,549 --> 02:38:55,352
SAM: Yes.

2621
02:38:55,352 --> 02:38:56,589
LAURA: Oh, then, never mind.

2622
02:38:56,589 --> 02:38:58,662
MATT: It's too late, you cast Cure Wounds. Go
ahead and roll for it.

2623
02:38:58,662 --> 02:39:07,651
LAURA: Fine. I'm trying to be nice, trying to save
you a damn spell.

2624
02:39:07,651 --> 02:39:11,542
MATT: You hear Taryon say that as soon as you
finish casting the spell into the dwarf woman.

2625
02:39:11,542 --> 02:39:17,491
SAM: We'll see how well-- hmm.

2626
02:39:17,491 --> 02:39:19,333
LAURA: 18, plus--

2627
02:39:19,333 --> 02:39:22,549
TALIESIN: That is the most condescending "hmm" I
think I've ever experienced!

2628
02:39:22,549 --> 02:39:23,995
LAURA: Do I add anything?

2629
02:39:23,995 --> 02:39:25,318
MATT: You add your wisdom modifier.

2630
02:39:25,318 --> 02:39:31,580
LAURA: 18 plus three. 21 whole points.

2631
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:36,566
MATT: Where once you're groggy, the sudden flash
of the divine energy and the healing power that

2632
02:39:36,566 --> 02:39:43,722
sifts through your body, it brings a moment of
respite and calmness to you, and you feel a lot

2633
02:39:43,722 --> 02:39:45,744
better than you did a few moments ago.

2634
02:39:45,744 --> 02:39:48,557
NOELLE: Cool. Can I get off this table now?

2635
02:39:48,557 --> 02:39:50,285
LAURA: Vax, can you help me pick these locks?

2636
02:39:50,285 --> 02:39:51,830
MATT: What did you roll, Vax?

2637
02:39:51,830 --> 02:39:54,023
LIAM: Oh, a 31 or 33.

2638
02:39:54,023 --> 02:39:55,713
MATT: Yeah, the manacles are not trapped.

2639
02:39:55,713 --> 02:39:58,555
LIAM: All right. All right, give us a second, my
sister and I will.

2640
02:39:58,555 --> 02:40:00,247
LAURA: I'll work on the legs if you work on the
hands.

2641
02:40:00,247 --> 02:40:04,361
MATT: All right. So, go ahead, both you guys roll
to pick locks.

2642
02:40:04,361 --> 02:40:07,311
LAURA: Which is what?

2643
02:40:07,311 --> 02:40:08,563
LIAM: 30.

2644
02:40:08,563 --> 02:40:11,370
MATT: Dex bonus plus your proficiency bonus.

2645
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:13,559
LAURA: Oh. Awesome.

2646
02:40:13,559 --> 02:40:15,864
SAM: (whispers) What's your name?

2647
02:40:15,864 --> 02:40:16,820
NOELLE: What?

2648
02:40:16,820 --> 02:40:18,383
SAM: What's your name?

2649
02:40:18,383 --> 02:40:20,421
NOELLE: Why are we whispering?

2650
02:40:20,421 --> 02:40:22,357
SAM: There's bad guys everywhere, we're in hell!

2651
02:40:22,357 --> 02:40:23,424
NOELLE: Oh, right.

2652
02:40:23,424 --> 02:40:25,014
LAURA: 24.

2653
02:40:25,014 --> 02:40:29,911
MATT: Okay, you guys take a quick moment and very
deftly and very quietly, the twins in unison

2654
02:40:29,911 --> 02:40:35,662
release the manacles and you instinctively sit up
and rub your wrists.

2655
02:40:35,662 --> 02:40:41,094
MARISHA: Wow, have you guys been rehearsing that?
That was impressive. Good job, twins!

2656
02:40:41,094 --> 02:40:44,453
NOELLE: Whoa, there's two of them. Fuck.

2657
02:40:44,453 --> 02:40:47,860
MARISHA: I know, it's confusing sometimes.

2658
02:40:47,860 --> 02:40:49,842
NOELLE: What's your name?

2659
02:40:49,842 --> 02:40:51,322
SAM: (whispers) What's your name?

2660
02:40:51,322 --> 02:40:53,129
NOELLE: I'm Tova.

2661
02:40:53,129 --> 02:40:55,879
ALL: Tova.

2662
02:40:55,879 --> 02:40:59,841
NOELLE: Who the fuck are you? Why are you in
here?

2663
02:40:59,841 --> 02:41:02,462
LIAM: Well, we're tourists.

2664
02:41:02,462 --> 02:41:08,461
MARISHA: Well, this is Freddie, that's Yrat,
that's Wade and Wode, and that's Greg.

2665
02:41:08,461 --> 02:41:10,185
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's not give too much info.

2666
02:41:10,185 --> 02:41:16,525
MARISHA: You can call us Mox Vachina.

2667
02:41:16,525 --> 02:41:23,497
TALIESIN: Let's put it this way. We're sneaking
into this unholy compound in Dis, basically a city

2668
02:41:23,497 --> 02:41:29,974
of hell, to do something inappropriate, we find
you tied to a table, we figure that maybe you're

2669
02:41:29,974 --> 02:41:31,796
in the mood to --

2670
02:41:31,796 --> 02:41:32,797
LAURA: Help out?

2671
02:41:32,797 --> 02:41:38,038
SAM: Did you see season two of Prison Break?
Because that's what we're doing.

2672
02:41:38,038 --> 02:41:40,611
LIAM: We're here to solve a problem.

2673
02:41:40,611 --> 02:41:45,783
NOELLE: Are we killing something?

2674
02:41:45,783 --> 02:41:47,650
ALL: Yes.

2675
02:41:47,650 --> 02:41:49,038
NOELLE: Can I come?

2676
02:41:49,038 --> 02:41:50,287
TALIESIN: Who put you here?

2677
02:41:50,287 --> 02:41:51,478
LAURA: Where's your shit?

2678
02:41:51,478 --> 02:41:53,202
TRAVIS: Yeah, Tova, did you have a weapon when you
were brought here?

2679
02:41:53,202 --> 02:41:55,682
NOELLE: I did, it was really cool, too. Can we go
find it?

2680
02:41:55,682 --> 02:41:56,895
TRAVIS: Yeah, what'd you have?

2681
02:41:56,895 --> 02:42:04,992
NOELLE: Oh, shouldn't have moved that fast, hang
on. Yeah, I have a maul.

2682
02:42:04,992 --> 02:42:06,336
TRAVIS: Really?

2683
02:42:06,336 --> 02:42:10,974
NOELLE: It's really cool, it's here somewhere. I
don't know where.

2684
02:42:10,974 --> 02:42:12,604
TRAVIS: Should we look around the room for the
maul?

2685
02:42:12,604 --> 02:42:13,713
NOELLE: How healed am I?

2686
02:42:13,713 --> 02:42:15,299
MATT: With that, you're back to full.

2687
02:42:15,299 --> 02:42:16,160
NOELLE: Oh, cool!

2688
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:19,042
MATT: Because you've been resting for a while and
recovering from the wounds of

2689
02:42:19,042 --> 02:42:20,720
the last torture session.

2690
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:22,182
MARISHA: So there's no one else in here, right? Is
it still dark?

2691
02:42:22,182 --> 02:42:29,800
MATT: The chamber has low flickering light from
two different candelabras, one near you guys in

2692
02:42:29,800 --> 02:42:32,890
the corner and one near the center doorways over
here.

2693
02:42:32,890 --> 02:42:36,844
LIAM: I get the flametongue dagger out. Is your
shit on the walls around here?

2694
02:42:36,844 --> 02:42:38,232
Do you see it in here?

2695
02:42:38,232 --> 02:42:39,438
MARISHA: Yeah, I light up my hands.

2696
02:42:39,438 --> 02:42:44,120
MATT: You guys do a quick pass. You look around,
and there are some chests around here and you

2697
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:49,406
carefully go through some of them that are left
open, and you do not see any of your equipment

2698
02:42:49,406 --> 02:42:50,262
within the room.

2699
02:42:50,262 --> 02:42:51,249
LAURA: Do you see anything cool there?

2700
02:42:51,249 --> 02:42:52,636
NOELLE: Is there anything I can use?

2701
02:42:52,636 --> 02:42:55,358
MATT: There are a number of torture implements.

2702
02:42:55,358 --> 02:42:57,105
NOELLE: Can I have one?

2703
02:42:57,105 --> 02:43:00,444
MATT: Yeah. Of the things that look most useful to
you, there's a giant iron fork.

2704
02:43:00,444 --> 02:43:03,808
There are chained hooks.

2705
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:07,256
LAURA: Pike would be so happy right now, she loves
torture devices.

2706
02:43:07,256 --> 02:43:11,000
NOELLE: I'll get that big ol' fork.

2707
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,804
MATT: It's a two-pronged long, thick metal fork.

2708
02:43:15,804 --> 02:43:16,656
NOELLE: Okay.

2709
02:43:16,656 --> 02:43:21,678
TRAVIS: Not to slow your roll or nothing but I
have a greatsword if you want one.

2710
02:43:21,678 --> 02:43:23,788
NOELLE: Ooh, yeah! No, that sounds better.

2711
02:43:23,788 --> 02:43:24,655
TRAVIS: Okay.

2712
02:43:24,655 --> 02:43:25,664
NOELLE: I put the fork back.

2713
02:43:25,664 --> 02:43:27,480
TRAVIS: Are you sure you can handle a greatsword?
It's, like, big league.

2714
02:43:27,480 --> 02:43:34,726
NOELLE: I'm very strong. It's probably bigger than
I am.

2715
02:43:34,726 --> 02:43:40,245
MATT: But as a dwarf, you're stocky and strong
with your background as well,

2716
02:43:40,245 --> 02:43:41,738
it's not really an issue.

2717
02:43:41,738 --> 02:43:45,798
MARISHA: Tova, that sword makes you look so tall.

2718
02:43:45,798 --> 02:43:47,016
NOELLE: Thank you.

2719
02:43:47,016 --> 02:43:49,108
TRAVIS: What the fuck happened to your face?
Shit.

2720
02:43:49,108 --> 02:43:55,511
NOELLE: Oh, this was preexisting, actually.
Unfortunate home chemistry set accident.

2721
02:43:55,511 --> 02:43:58,664
SAM: Ooh, are you an alchemist?

2722
02:43:58,664 --> 02:44:01,434
NOELLE: It wasn't my chemistry set.

2723
02:44:01,434 --> 02:44:02,805
SAM: Oh.

2724
02:44:02,805 --> 02:44:09,225
MATT: At this point, you hear a (click) sound and
a door beginning to open on

2725
02:44:09,225 --> 02:44:10,810
the north end of the wall.

2726
02:44:10,810 --> 02:44:12,248
LAURA: Oh shit, hide! Hide under the table!

2727
02:44:12,248 --> 02:44:13,943
TRAVIS: I fall flat on the floor.

2728
02:44:13,943 --> 02:44:16,526
SAM: I go still as a statue.

2729
02:44:16,526 --> 02:44:20,068
MATT: Make stealth checks, Taryon and Grog with
disadvantage.

2730
02:44:20,068 --> 02:44:24,648
MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

2731
02:44:24,648 --> 02:44:26,151
LAURA: Yeah, we still have Pass Without a Trace.

2732
02:44:26,151 --> 02:44:27,105
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good.

2733
02:44:27,105 --> 02:44:28,062
MARISHA: Okay, cool.

2734
02:44:28,062 --> 02:44:30,536
SAM: 19 for me.

2735
02:44:30,536 --> 02:44:34,659
TRAVIS: A 19 and a 20. A natural 19 and a natural
20.

2736
02:44:34,659 --> 02:44:38,186
MATT: With disadvantage, you got a 19? Holy shit!
Oh, plus-- yeah, yeah.

2737
02:44:38,186 --> 02:44:40,974
TRAVIS: So, 21, 31.

2738
02:44:40,974 --> 02:44:43,636
NOELLE: Am I joining in here? Or can I just get
back on the table?

2739
02:44:43,636 --> 02:44:45,500
MATT: You can get on the table if you want.

2740
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:48,647
NOELLE: All right, so I get back on the table.

2741
02:44:48,647 --> 02:44:50,244
MATT: All right, but you do it noisily.

2742
02:44:50,244 --> 02:44:53,346
NOELLE: I flop down on the table.

2743
02:44:53,346 --> 02:44:56,286
MATT: All right. So the door opens, and as it
does--

2744
02:44:56,286 --> 02:45:01,390
LAURA: Oh god, oh god. Ah! Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god!

2745
02:45:01,390 --> 02:45:02,402
TALIESIN: 18.

2746
02:45:02,402 --> 02:45:03,600
SAM: It's a map, it's a map!

2747
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:09,144
MATT: A creature comes through, similar to Ipkesh,
another humanoid, this one a little thicker,

2748
02:45:09,144 --> 02:45:16,266
burlier, with a medium-grey hair that is kind of a
tangled mass all into dreads right past the

2749
02:45:16,266 --> 02:45:22,325
shoulders. Big, leathery red wings, red skin,
horns at the front, and has a big sword it kind of

2750
02:45:22,325 --> 02:45:27,124
is pulling out of a sheath on the side of it as it
comes in, looking around the room. Which--

2751
02:45:27,124 --> 02:45:38,807
Immediately kind of steps into the chamber, as you
guys all hide off to the side. "Shit!" And is

2752
02:45:38,807 --> 02:45:40,648
going to turn around and just go running in the
opposite direction.

2753
02:45:40,648 --> 02:45:42,482
LAURA: No! I shoot an arrow in the back of his
neck.

2754
02:45:42,482 --> 02:45:45,965
MATT: Okay, so, this going to be a surprise-- Not
a surprise round, it knows you guys are there, but

2755
02:45:45,965 --> 02:45:50,666
this-- this is going to be a roll for initiative.
Everyone, roll some initiative.

2756
02:45:50,666 --> 02:45:56,167
MARISHA: Yeah! Yes. Yes! That's bad, that's a
natural one!

2757
02:45:56,167 --> 02:45:57,739
MATT: (laughs) Oh, man.

2758
02:45:57,739 --> 02:46:01,000
MARISHA: I was so excited and then it went away so
quickly!

2759
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:08,692
MATT: All righty. So, top of the round, we have 25
to 20. Anybody?

2760
02:46:08,692 --> 02:46:09,955
TALIESIN: 28.

2761
02:46:09,955 --> 02:46:13,695
MATT: 28, Jesus Christ! Okay.

2762
02:46:13,695 --> 02:46:16,436
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody? Good?

2763
02:46:16,436 --> 02:46:20,515
NOELLE: 21.

2764
02:46:20,515 --> 02:46:24,589
MATT: Oh, 21. Nice! All righty, 20 to 15?

2765
02:46:24,589 --> 02:46:26,119
LIAM: 18.

2766
02:46:26,119 --> 02:46:28,583
MATT: 18. All right.

2767
02:46:28,583 --> 02:46:29,305
LAURA: 16.

2768
02:46:29,305 --> 02:46:32,175
MATT: 16. 15 to ten?

2769
02:46:32,175 --> 02:46:33,777
TRAVIS: 14.

2770
02:46:33,777 --> 02:46:39,868
MATT: Ten to five? Five to one?

2771
02:46:39,868 --> 02:46:41,032
SAM: Four.

2772
02:46:41,032 --> 02:46:41,935
MARISHA: Three?

2773
02:46:41,935 --> 02:46:42,880
MATT: Oh.

2774
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:43,559
LAURA: No.

2775
02:46:43,559 --> 02:46:44,918
LIAM: Oh, kids.

2776
02:46:44,918 --> 02:46:50,803
MATT: All righty. Percival, you're up first. You
see this devilish humanoid--

2777
02:46:50,803 --> 02:46:52,105
SAM: See you in 20 minutes.

2778
02:46:52,105 --> 02:46:53,266
MATT: -- beginning to pivot and turn.

2779
02:46:53,266 --> 02:46:54,629
TALIESIN: Can you point to me on the map?

2780
02:46:54,629 --> 02:46:55,632
MATT: You are right there.

2781
02:46:55,632 --> 02:46:59,269
LAURA: Don't use the gun. (muffled) Don't use the
gun.

2782
02:46:59,269 --> 02:47:01,809
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to do a couple things.

2783
02:47:01,809 --> 02:47:02,536
MATT: Okay.

2784
02:47:02,536 --> 02:47:04,310
TRAVIS: Blow the cover for everyone.

2785
02:47:04,310 --> 02:47:06,761
TALIESIN: Blow the cover for ev-- well.

2786
02:47:06,761 --> 02:47:09,989
LAURA: No. Don't use the gun.

2787
02:47:09,989 --> 02:47:19,909
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my movement to run
around him and shut the door.

2788
02:47:19,909 --> 02:47:21,770
MATT: Okay.

2789
02:47:21,770 --> 02:47:24,887
TALIESIN: Using my boots. 'Cause my boots are
already active.

2790
02:47:24,887 --> 02:47:28,021
MATT: Right. The doorway is about the size of him,
so you--

2791
02:47:28,021 --> 02:47:29,108
TALIESIN: Oh, it's too big?

2792
02:47:29,108 --> 02:47:33,216
MATT: I mean, it takes up the entire doorway,
essentially, and it's just pivoting after it

2793
02:47:33,216 --> 02:47:36,934
notices you guys, so you're gonna have to make a
tumble check to try and make it past him.

2794
02:47:36,934 --> 02:47:38,814
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, hold on then.

2795
02:47:38,814 --> 02:47:42,455
MATT: An acrobatics roll, but yeah.

2796
02:47:42,455 --> 02:47:46,004
TALIESIN: I'll-- you know what, I'll do the
acrobatics roll to try and shut the door,

2797
02:47:46,004 --> 02:47:48,922
and--

2798
02:47:48,922 --> 02:47:54,496
MATT: Okay, so you're trying to, basically, as he
goes to spin around, you dash forward, and roll

2799
02:47:54,496 --> 02:47:58,340
into a tumble to try and pop up on the other side,
so go ahead and roll acrobatics check.

2800
02:47:58,340 --> 02:48:01,737
TALIESIN: That'll do. 22.

2801
02:48:01,737 --> 02:48:02,765
MATT: 22.

2802
02:48:02,765 --> 02:48:03,844
LAURA: Will it do?

2803
02:48:03,844 --> 02:48:05,622
MATT: Natural 20 on his end.

2804
02:48:05,622 --> 02:48:06,874
MARISHA: Aw!

2805
02:48:06,874 --> 02:48:12,759
MATT: So, as you tumble, not even noticing-- The
world spins as you go into a roll and suddenly

2806
02:48:12,759 --> 02:48:19,086
there's just a flash of white, and there's just a
foot, a massive boot in your face as the

2807
02:48:19,086 --> 02:48:24,999
individual slams a kick into your head to stop you
from tumbling forward, and you stop in place. So

2808
02:48:24,999 --> 02:48:28,459
you're currently prone on the ground, but you
still have your action if you want to.

2809
02:48:28,459 --> 02:48:30,465
TALIESIN: I'm going to take three slashes at him
with my sword.

2810
02:48:30,465 --> 02:48:37,074
MATT: Go for it. You are prone. You have
disadvantage on your attack rolls.

2811
02:48:37,074 --> 02:48:38,635
TALIESIN: Disadvantage on the attack rolls?

2812
02:48:38,635 --> 02:48:39,557
MATT: Yes.

2813
02:48:39,557 --> 02:48:47,360
TALIESIN: But I am prone. Okay, so, attack number
one. That don't matter. 28?

2814
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:48,604
MATT: That hits.

2815
02:48:48,604 --> 02:48:53,273
TALIESIN: Just do attack number two. That's 15.

2816
02:48:53,273 --> 02:48:55,113
MATT: 15 misses.

2817
02:48:55,113 --> 02:48:57,955
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

2818
02:48:57,955 --> 02:48:59,858
TALIESIN: And, uh, 24.

2819
02:48:59,858 --> 02:49:01,547
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage twice.

2820
02:49:01,547 --> 02:49:05,778
TALIESIN: Got two hits with the-- what's-- these.

2821
02:49:05,778 --> 02:49:07,678
MATT: And, Tova, you're up next, so be ready.

2822
02:49:07,678 --> 02:49:08,555
SAM: Tova!

2823
02:49:08,555 --> 02:49:09,647
TALIESIN: Two hits, so that's--

2824
02:49:09,647 --> 02:49:13,603
LIAM: Is it the quiet gun?

2825
02:49:13,603 --> 02:49:16,484
TALIESIN: I'm using a sword, not a gun, so
that's--

2826
02:49:16,484 --> 02:49:17,850
LIAM: Oh, right, right, right.

2827
02:49:17,850 --> 02:49:20,245
TALIESIN: That's 18 points of damage.

2828
02:49:20,245 --> 02:49:21,465
MATT: All righty.

2829
02:49:21,465 --> 02:49:27,368
TALIESIN: 18 points of damage, and, you know,
let's just burn a little bit of electricity too,

2830
02:49:27,368 --> 02:49:29,231
just to hurt him as well.

2831
02:49:29,231 --> 02:49:30,562
LIAM: Oh, yes.

2832
02:49:30,562 --> 02:49:33,214
MATT: 18 from both strikes?

2833
02:49:33,214 --> 02:49:34,635
TALIESIN: That's everything combined.

2834
02:49:34,635 --> 02:49:35,557
MATT: Yeah.

2835
02:49:35,557 --> 02:49:50,776
TALIESIN: And then let's do a-- where is-- here we
are. Let's do a-- where is the damage? 1d6

2836
02:49:50,776 --> 02:49:53,470
lightning, so let's just burn two charges of that
as well.

2837
02:49:53,470 --> 02:49:54,402
MATT: All righty.

2838
02:49:54,402 --> 02:49:56,910
TALIESIN: I'm out of d6s for some reason that I
cannot comprehend.

2839
02:49:56,910 --> 02:49:57,924
SAM: Here. Here.

2840
02:49:57,924 --> 02:49:59,020
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2841
02:49:59,020 --> 02:50:00,144
LAURA: Ooh.

2842
02:50:00,144 --> 02:50:03,319
TALIESIN: And let's add five points of lightning
damage to that as well.

2843
02:50:03,319 --> 02:50:06,864
MATT: All righty. So, as you land on the ground,
you pull your sword out and just swipe three times

2844
02:50:06,864 --> 02:50:12,048
in the air, two of them striking across its thigh
and the kneecap. It still stands, but you see it

2845
02:50:12,048 --> 02:50:16,680
took a nice, sizable chunk out of it. That ends
your turn, Percival? Tova, what are you doing?

2846
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:20,377
You're currently still up on the table, sitting
up. You have the greatsword at your side and you

2847
02:50:20,377 --> 02:50:25,537
watch as the-- one of them, one of the new
people stumbles onto the ground and then slashes

2848
02:50:25,695 --> 02:50:29,020
at this creature a couple times, and it's right
there kind of still trying to find its way out.

2849
02:50:29,020 --> 02:50:30,370
What're you doing?

2850
02:50:30,370 --> 02:50:35,712
NOELLE: Gonna grab this cool new greatsword that I
have, stand up on the table, and just jump at this

2851
02:50:35,712 --> 02:50:39,146
guy's head, and swing at it with my cool new
greatsword.

2852
02:50:39,146 --> 02:50:40,352
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2853
02:50:40,352 --> 02:50:44,326
MATT: All right, so as you leap in the air,
bringing it down, go ahead and make both attacks.

2854
02:50:44,326 --> 02:50:53,577
First one. This would be a plus ten because it's
not magical, I believe, right.

2855
02:50:53,577 --> 02:50:55,157
NOELLE: Okay.

2856
02:50:55,157 --> 02:50:58,041
That's a 13 and a 17 to hit?

2857
02:50:58,107 --> 02:50:59,095
LAURA: Yeah.

2858
02:50:59,095 --> 02:51:01,836
MATT: Unfortunately, neither hit. The one--

2859
02:51:01,836 --> 02:51:04,222
NOELLE: Been tied to a table for a while.

2860
02:51:04,274 --> 02:51:08,016
MATT: Yeah. The first one, it hits the front of
its armor and just scrapes off the side. The other

2861
02:51:08,016 --> 02:51:12,059
one, you swing back and it slams into the
stonework, and it just ducks underneath. Bonus

2862
02:51:12,059 --> 02:51:14,462
action, anything you want to do?

2863
02:51:14,462 --> 02:51:18,081
NOELLE: Yes.

2864
02:51:18,081 --> 02:51:20,412
MATT: Before it tries to run away?

2865
02:51:20,412 --> 02:51:23,486
NOELLE: I want to turn into a bear.

2866
02:51:23,486 --> 02:51:24,888
ALL: What?

2867
02:51:24,888 --> 02:51:27,097
LAURA: Oh my god!

2868
02:51:27,097 --> 02:51:28,623
SAM: Double bear action!

2869
02:51:28,623 --> 02:51:32,757
LAURA: (sings) Tova's my favorite person in the
whole universe.

2870
02:51:32,757 --> 02:51:36,003
MATT: You watch now, you see the clothing that was
on her before wasn't torn from torture, but her

2871
02:51:36,003 --> 02:51:43,978
form rages into this bipedal humanoid bear with
rippling muscles, the same scars across the face,

2872
02:51:43,978 --> 02:51:50,090
and begins to just growl as the greatsword now
looks almost small in comparison in this mighty

2873
02:51:50,090 --> 02:51:53,004
kind of humanoid bear's grasp.

2874
02:51:53,004 --> 02:51:53,877
MARISHA: What?

2875
02:51:53,877 --> 02:51:55,046
LIAM: Ah, she Beorn-ed it!

2876
02:51:55,046 --> 02:51:56,325
MATT: That's the end of your turn.

2877
02:51:56,325 --> 02:51:57,800
NOELLE: I'm just wearing sexy bear clothes now.

2878
02:51:57,800 --> 02:52:01,587
LAURA: It's like a bra, like a little bikini.

2879
02:52:01,587 --> 02:52:02,571
TRAVIS: Awesome.

2880
02:52:02,571 --> 02:52:07,122
MATT: All right, the devil-creature is going to go
ahead and turn around--

2881
02:52:07,122 --> 02:52:09,930
MARISHA: Sort of like an 80s fantasy novel cover.

2882
02:52:09,930 --> 02:52:11,345
MATT: -- and attempt to move this way to the
door.

2883
02:52:11,345 --> 02:52:12,603
TALIESIN: Do I get an attack of opportunity?

2884
02:52:12,603 --> 02:52:14,354
MATT: Both of you guys get an attack of
opportunity as it rushes away.

2885
02:52:14,354 --> 02:52:15,317
LAURA: Oh, no, it's getting away?

2886
02:52:15,317 --> 02:52:17,074
MARISHA: No! Kill it.

2887
02:52:17,074 --> 02:52:18,748
LAURA: We've gotta stop it, we've gotta stop it.

2888
02:52:18,748 --> 02:52:19,587
LIAM: Damn it.

2889
02:52:19,587 --> 02:52:20,673
TALIESIN: Disadvantage or no?

2890
02:52:20,673 --> 02:52:22,065
MATT: Yes, 'cause you're still prone.

2891
02:52:22,065 --> 02:52:25,135
MARISHA: Come on, Percy. Oh, son of a bitch!

2892
02:52:25,135 --> 02:52:26,170
NOELLE: 24.

2893
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:29,612
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage. That's
2d6 for the damage on the greatsword.

2894
02:52:29,612 --> 02:52:32,344
NOELLE: Okay, 2d-- Oh, sorry. Rusty at this.

2895
02:52:32,344 --> 02:52:36,763
MATT: It'd be plus six. Because your strength is
five and plus one there for the weapon.

2896
02:52:36,763 --> 02:52:41,058
NOELLE: That is 2d6 plus one?

2897
02:52:41,058 --> 02:52:42,487
MATT: Plus six total.

2898
02:52:42,487 --> 02:52:44,058
NOELLE: Okay, so that is 13.

2899
02:52:44,058 --> 02:52:48,134
MATT: Okay, and if you ever roll a one on the
dice, or a one or a two, you can re-roll it once.

2900
02:52:48,134 --> 02:52:50,691
TALIESIN: Point of random order before he runs--

2901
02:52:50,691 --> 02:52:51,822
NOELLE: I can re-roll it twice?

2902
02:52:51,822 --> 02:52:56,017
MATT: You can roll each one once, like if it gets
under that. It's part of your Great Weapon

2903
02:52:56,017 --> 02:52:57,137
Master.

2904
02:52:57,137 --> 02:52:59,068
TALIESIN: Random point of order, isn't this a
surprise round?

2905
02:52:59,068 --> 02:52:59,886
MATT: No.

2906
02:52:59,886 --> 02:53:00,819
TALIESIN: Damn it.

2907
02:53:00,819 --> 02:53:01,700
SAM: They noticed us.

2908
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:02,755
TALIESIN: He noticed us, okay, never mind.

2909
02:53:02,755 --> 02:53:03,477
MATT: Yeah.

2910
02:53:03,477 --> 02:53:05,041
NOELLE: Well, I rolled another one, so it's the
same, it's 13.

2911
02:53:05,041 --> 02:53:11,079
MATT: So 13 points of damage. All righty. So you
hack at it as it's running away, but it still

2912
02:53:11,079 --> 02:53:15,135
manages to go-- get out over this side. It goes to
the next door and throws it open.

2913
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:15,862
LAURA: No!

2914
02:53:15,862 --> 02:53:19,855
MARISHA: What's in it?

2915
02:53:19,855 --> 02:53:23,825
MATT: Okay, you guys still can't quite see what's
in that chamber beyond from your perspective. And

2916
02:53:23,825 --> 02:53:29,827
is going to move in. It just gets about that far
into the chamber. All right. That gets us to Vax's

2917
02:53:29,827 --> 02:53:31,294
turn.

2918
02:53:31,294 --> 02:53:32,631
LIAM: Shit, and he's out of sight now?

2919
02:53:32,631 --> 02:53:35,746
MATT: He's just moved-- He's out of sight of you,
currently, because you're over here.

2920
02:53:35,746 --> 02:53:36,711
LAURA: Oh.

2921
02:53:36,711 --> 02:53:38,580
MATT: Yeah. You don't see him.

2922
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:43,466
LIAM: All right. I'm gonna-- I can't really see
from where I'm at, so I want to move more in line

2923
02:53:43,466 --> 02:53:45,923
with the door and see if I can see him if I run
over in line.

2924
02:53:45,923 --> 02:53:49,072
MATT: You can. If you run to where the doorway is
open, you can see him as he's just disappearing

2925
02:53:49,072 --> 02:53:50,734
into a darkened chamber beyond.

2926
02:53:50,734 --> 02:53:52,639
LIAM: Dagger, dagger.

2927
02:53:52,639 --> 02:53:53,978
MATT: Go for it.

2928
02:53:53,978 --> 02:53:55,170
TALIESIN: End this.

2929
02:53:55,170 --> 02:53:57,022
MARISHA: End this.

2930
02:53:57,022 --> 02:54:01,433
LIAM: First one is-- balls, is 17.

2931
02:54:01,433 --> 02:54:02,388
MATT: Misses.

2932
02:54:02,388 --> 02:54:04,987
LIAM: Second one is a 29.

2933
02:54:04,987 --> 02:54:06,091
MATT: 29 hits.

2934
02:54:06,091 --> 02:54:17,834
LIAM: Nyeh. Fuck a duck. There's two plus-- that
is just two, but it's the poison dagger, so I'm

2935
02:54:17,834 --> 02:54:19,361
gonna unload venom in him.

2936
02:54:19,361 --> 02:54:20,515
MATT: Okay.

2937
02:54:20,515 --> 02:54:22,424
LIAM: DC 15.

2938
02:54:22,424 --> 02:54:27,890
MATT: That is a 12, no.

2939
02:54:27,890 --> 02:54:37,661
LIAM: Okay. So he takes-- that's the wrong die.
He-- ah! Oh, it's going as far as it possibly can.

2940
02:54:37,661 --> 02:54:45,107
That is 19. Yeah. Ten and a nine.

2941
02:54:45,107 --> 02:54:49,476
MATT: Okay, got you. Cool. All right, so, the
dagger (impact sound) and you see him stumble for

2942
02:54:49,476 --> 02:54:54,687
a moment as his wings kind of instinctually curl
up from the sudden burst of poison in his system.

2943
02:54:54,687 --> 02:54:56,744
So.

2944
02:54:56,744 --> 02:54:57,994
LIAM: That's it, I'm out, I'm done.

2945
02:54:57,994 --> 02:54:59,682
MATT: You do have some more movement if you wanted
to.

2946
02:54:59,682 --> 02:55:02,760
LIAM: No, I don't, I want to stay where I am.

2947
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:04,427
LAURA: Back out of the way of the door.

2948
02:55:04,427 --> 02:55:05,537
MATT: Okay, so you're going to stay in the
doorway?

2949
02:55:05,537 --> 02:55:08,125
LAURA: Well, you can move out of the way of the
doorway so that other people can shoot at him

2950
02:55:08,125 --> 02:55:14,240
better, maybe, in line of sight. Just move out of
the doorway!

2951
02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:15,651
LIAM: Nope. Nope!

2952
02:55:15,651 --> 02:55:18,453
MATT: That brings us to Vex's turn! Vex, your
turn.

2953
02:55:18,453 --> 02:55:21,017
LAURA: Thanks for blocking my fucking shot!

2954
02:55:21,017 --> 02:55:22,930
LIAM: I'm across the country, man, I can't really
see.

2955
02:55:22,930 --> 02:55:25,819
MATT: Yeah, it's all good. I mean, he's not-- He's
staying low, and your brother knows not to block

2956
02:55:25,819 --> 02:55:26,790
the whole path, so--

2957
02:55:26,790 --> 02:55:27,706
LIAM: Yeah.

2958
02:55:27,706 --> 02:55:28,502
LAURA: All right--

2959
02:55:28,502 --> 02:55:30,355
LIAM: I'm always doing squats, man.

2960
02:55:30,355 --> 02:55:32,245
LAURA: Well then-- I'm going to shoot him.

2961
02:55:32,245 --> 02:55:33,223
MATT: Go for it.

2962
02:55:33,223 --> 02:55:34,574
TRAVIS: Your brother?

2963
02:55:34,574 --> 02:55:40,254
LAURA: No! I'm going to shoot the dude, the red
guy. I'm going to shoot him-- Yeah, I'm going to

2964
02:55:40,254 --> 02:55:41,292
shoot him.

2965
02:55:41,292 --> 02:55:42,563
MATT: Go for it.

2966
02:55:42,563 --> 02:55:45,777
LAURA: Okay, the first one is a 20.

2967
02:55:45,777 --> 02:55:47,429
MATT: 20 hits.

2968
02:55:47,429 --> 02:56:02,763
LAURA: (silly voice) Okay. 11-- Fucking shit. 11
plus four lightning damage and then-- Ugh! I'm

2969
02:56:02,763 --> 02:56:06,374
going to fucking Hunter's Mark him, motherfucker,
because I forgot to do it.

2970
02:56:06,374 --> 02:56:07,247
MATT: All righty.

2971
02:56:07,247 --> 02:56:08,710
LAURA: Because I'm a fucking asshole!

2972
02:56:08,710 --> 02:56:11,550
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow, that's like six in one--

2973
02:56:11,550 --> 02:56:14,121
LAURA: And the second one definitely hits him,
too.

2974
02:56:14,121 --> 02:56:15,390
TRAVIS: I'm keeping count.

2975
02:56:15,390 --> 02:56:16,965
LIAM: You got to love yourself.

2976
02:56:16,965 --> 02:56:23,911
LAURA: (affected accent) So then I am going to--
(normal voice) Where's my damn eights? Okay, here

2977
02:56:23,911 --> 02:56:28,187
they are. God damn it! Nine, ten, 11--

2978
02:56:28,187 --> 02:56:29,589
MARISHA: It's okay, we love you!

2979
02:56:29,589 --> 02:56:33,798
LAURA: 11 plus one lightning damage, because I
suck!

2980
02:56:33,798 --> 02:56:34,800
MARISHA: No.

2981
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:35,909
MATT: Okay.

2982
02:56:35,909 --> 02:56:37,213
LAURA: And then four for Hunter's Mark.

2983
02:56:37,213 --> 02:56:38,248
MATT: All righty.

2984
02:56:38,248 --> 02:56:39,482
MARISHA: You're an amazing person.

2985
02:56:39,482 --> 02:56:42,797
MATT: So, both arrows (impact sound). It tumbles
forward, kind of like falls to one knee for a

2986
02:56:42,797 --> 02:56:47,951
second, and is still picking up and running. So
that finishes your turn.

2987
02:56:47,951 --> 02:56:50,847
TRAVIS: That was nine swears in one turn, that was
good.

2988
02:56:50,847 --> 02:56:52,139
LAURA: Was it? Sorry.

2989
02:56:52,139 --> 02:56:54,577
MATT: That brings us to Grog.

2990
02:56:54,577 --> 02:56:57,047
TRAVIS: Oh, really? (yells)

2991
02:56:57,047 --> 02:56:58,265
MARISHA: Kill him!

2992
02:56:58,265 --> 02:56:59,200
TRAVIS: (yells)

2993
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:00,167
MARISHA: Kill him!

2994
02:57:00,167 --> 02:57:01,054
(laughter)

2995
02:57:01,054 --> 02:57:02,259
TRAVIS: I do a burpee off the floor.

2996
02:57:02,259 --> 02:57:04,642
MATT: (laughs) Easy enough for you.

2997
02:57:04,642 --> 02:57:07,626
TRAVIS: I take off running through the doorway!

2998
02:57:07,626 --> 02:57:16,019
MATT: Five, ten, 15-- 30, 35, 40, 45, 50-- You can
just get within melee range--

2999
02:57:16,019 --> 02:57:17,082
(cheering)

3000
02:57:17,082 --> 02:57:18,153
LAURA: Kill him, Grog!

3001
02:57:18,153 --> 02:57:22,705
MATT: -- because crazy barbarian speed. You also
reveal the rest of the chamber--

3002
02:57:22,705 --> 02:57:27,045
LAURA: Please don't be any more people in there!
Shit.

3003
02:57:27,045 --> 02:57:31,245
MATT: You see two of the-- This chamber contains a
bunch of--

3004
02:57:31,245 --> 02:57:35,462
LAURA: Oh, god.

3005
02:57:35,462 --> 02:57:40,931
MATT: A bunch of, looks like cells of some kind,
that are locked off with doors, and two of the

3006
02:57:40,931 --> 02:57:47,390
lemures, the weird fleshy tortured spirit things
kind of lie in the corner that all of a sudden see

3007
02:57:47,390 --> 02:57:52,534
you as you charge in and just pay attention to
your appearance. So, what are you going to do?

3008
02:57:52,534 --> 02:57:55,622
TRAVIS: I see him, and I say: hi. And I rage.

3009
02:57:55,622 --> 02:57:57,333
MATT: Okay. Is this your bonus action?

3010
02:57:57,333 --> 02:57:59,591
TRAVIS: Yeah. And I'm going to hit him twice!

3011
02:57:59,591 --> 02:58:00,467
LAURA: Yeah!

3012
02:58:00,467 --> 02:58:01,542
MATT: Go for it.

3013
02:58:01,542 --> 02:58:02,533
TRAVIS: Reckless, please.

3014
02:58:02,533 --> 02:58:03,521
MATT: Yes.

3015
02:58:03,521 --> 02:58:08,188
TRAVIS: That is--

3016
02:58:08,188 --> 02:58:10,171
LAURA: (Grog voice) That is death!

3017
02:58:10,171 --> 02:58:12,563
TRAVIS: (laughs) 24.

3018
02:58:12,563 --> 02:58:13,548
MATT: That hits.

3019
02:58:13,548 --> 02:58:23,439
TRAVIS: Nice. Nine-- Wait, there it is. 21.

3020
02:58:23,439 --> 02:58:24,917
MATT: 21 points of damage?

3021
02:58:24,917 --> 02:58:25,818
TRAVIS: Yes.

3022
02:58:25,818 --> 02:58:26,789
MATT: All righty.

3023
02:58:26,789 --> 02:58:33,626
TRAVIS: And the second one. Reckless. Thank god.
Because that was a one. 20-- 31.

3024
02:58:33,626 --> 02:58:35,119
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

3025
02:58:35,119 --> 02:58:41,592
TRAVIS: Jesus-- 11-- 23. 23 points of damage.

3026
02:58:41,592 --> 02:58:48,536
MATT: Okay. As you rush forward, slam once into
the back of his shoulder, he kind of falls to one

3027
02:58:48,536 --> 02:58:53,551
knee again, still wounded by the slashing to his
thighs and the arrows out of his back. The wings

3028
02:58:53,551 --> 02:58:57,079
kind of unfurl a bit, and he turns around, looking
like he's about to point his finger towards you--

3029
02:58:57,079 --> 02:58:57,865
TRAVIS: Nope.

3030
02:58:57,865 --> 02:59:02,119
MATT: -- there's like a flash in the eye, like
it's attempting to have some sort of type of-- but

3031
02:59:02,119 --> 02:59:06,077
before it does, you bring the hammer down onto his
face. Whack! And as it does, it just caves inward,

3032
02:59:06,077 --> 02:59:09,627
and falls to the ground, unmoving.

3033
02:59:09,627 --> 02:59:10,856
MARISHA: That was hot.

3034
02:59:10,856 --> 02:59:12,349
TALIESIN: (whispers) Drag him back in here.

3035
02:59:12,349 --> 02:59:13,356
LAURA: Yeah.

3036
02:59:13,356 --> 02:59:18,039
MARISHA: Metal Gear Solid this shit.

3037
02:59:18,039 --> 02:59:21,170
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't have anything else to do. That
was it-- my bonus action already.

3038
02:59:21,170 --> 02:59:23,849
TALIESIN: That may be the end of the--

3039
02:59:23,849 --> 02:59:25,743
MATT: That brings us to Taryon's turn.

3040
02:59:25,743 --> 02:59:27,440
TALIESIN: Oh! Nope, not.

3041
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:34,654
SAM: I will cast Haste on myself.

3042
02:59:34,654 --> 02:59:36,426
MATT: Okay.

3043
02:59:36,426 --> 02:59:45,346
SAM: And I will then start moving. Where am I?

3044
02:59:45,346 --> 02:59:46,918
MATT: You're right here.

3045
02:59:46,918 --> 02:59:49,680
SAM: I'm going to go-- I guess the direction Grog
went?

3046
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:52,231
MATT: All right. So that's five, ten, 15, 20--

3047
02:59:52,231 --> 02:59:53,750
TRAVIS: Following your partner.

3048
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:57,771
MATT: 30, 35, 40. You get all the way into this
room, you still have 20 feet of movement left, as

3049
02:59:57,771 --> 03:00:05,483
you enter next to Grog and see two of the fleshy
masses of tortured souls kind of starting to make

3050
03:00:05,483 --> 03:00:07,288
their way in the direction of you and Grog.

3051
03:00:07,288 --> 03:00:10,075
SAM: What do I have left?

3052
03:00:10,075 --> 03:00:13,236
MATT: You have your bonus action, that's it.
Because you cast Haste, and then did your

3053
03:00:13,236 --> 03:00:14,520
movement.

3054
03:00:14,520 --> 03:00:32,522
SAM: Sure. I'll just pull out my rod, grip it
hard, choke down on it, maybe grip it with my left

3055
03:00:32,522 --> 03:00:34,036
hand so it feels different--

3056
03:00:34,036 --> 03:00:38,439
(laughter)

3057
03:00:38,439 --> 03:00:39,526
MATT: Very well.

3058
03:00:39,526 --> 03:00:47,352
SAM: And I'll say, lance! And I'll just use the
rest of my movement to just charge at somebody.

3059
03:00:47,352 --> 03:00:55,808
MATT: You run up towards one of these creatures,
and as you get closer, as you see it becomes more

3060
03:00:55,808 --> 03:01:03,094
and more apparent in your vision, the more
horrifying it gets as you get closer. What's Doty

3061
03:01:03,094 --> 03:01:04,162
going to do?

3062
03:01:04,162 --> 03:01:09,124
SAM: As I took off I just said, "Doty, on me!" So
he's coming.

3063
03:01:09,124 --> 03:01:10,534
MATT: Doty's movement is--

3064
03:01:10,534 --> 03:01:11,761
SAM: 40.

3065
03:01:11,761 --> 03:01:14,070
TRAVIS: I like "on me" better than "roll out!"

3066
03:01:14,070 --> 03:01:18,241
MARISHA: Hey! Hey. Really?

3067
03:01:18,241 --> 03:01:20,741
MATT: Doty has to spend half of-- it's difficult
to get through the doorway-- and gets about that

3068
03:01:20,741 --> 03:01:26,789
far. Doty actually pushes Vax out of the way, it
has to bend down and get into this central

3069
03:01:26,789 --> 03:01:34,213
chamber. Doty can use the rest of the movement to
get into the room with you. Doty can get right

3070
03:01:34,213 --> 03:01:41,422
there, and that's all Doty can do this turn. All
righty, that brings us to Keyleth's turn.

3071
03:01:41,422 --> 03:01:49,411
MARISHA: That's what cool people say. My turn.
Guy's dead, right? That Grog was after?

3072
03:01:49,411 --> 03:01:50,381
MATT: Yes.

3073
03:01:50,381 --> 03:01:51,532
TRAVIS: It is hell.

3074
03:01:51,532 --> 03:01:53,369
MARISHA: It is hell.

3075
03:01:53,369 --> 03:01:56,485
TALIESIN: Can Grog not see to the right of him
yet?

3076
03:01:56,485 --> 03:02:01,596
MATT: Grog can see both of these things here. You
mean can Taryon see this way, you mean?

3077
03:02:01,656 --> 03:02:02,993
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3078
03:02:02,993 --> 03:02:06,968
MATT: Taryon can just barely begin to see a
hallway that goes further that way.

3079
03:02:06,968 --> 03:02:08,938
TALIESIN: Okay.

3080
03:02:08,938 --> 03:02:12,153
MARISHA: That's not a devil demony guy behind
Grog.

3081
03:02:12,153 --> 03:02:14,314
MATT: Over here, you mean?

3082
03:02:14,314 --> 03:02:19,425
MARISHA: You almost touched it, sorry.

3083
03:02:19,425 --> 03:02:21,811
MATT: You don't see anything in there, there's
nothing in your room right now.

3084
03:02:21,811 --> 03:02:23,163
MARISHA: What's that?

3085
03:02:23,163 --> 03:02:24,664
MATT: What's this here?

3086
03:02:24,664 --> 03:02:25,600
MARISHA: That.

3087
03:02:25,600 --> 03:02:26,935
MATT: That's Doty.

3088
03:02:26,935 --> 03:02:27,892
MARISHA: That.

3089
03:02:27,892 --> 03:02:28,790
MATT: That is Grog.

3090
03:02:28,790 --> 03:02:33,671
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Okay. And I don't see
anything.

3091
03:02:33,671 --> 03:02:36,793
MATT: You don't see anything in the chamber,
everyone's just kind of-- Your new friend turned

3092
03:02:36,793 --> 03:02:39,011
into a bear, and everyone ran through a door.

3093
03:02:39,011 --> 03:02:55,421
MARISHA: Tova! Tova! You're really awesome! Are
you also a druid? No?

3094
03:02:55,421 --> 03:02:58,907
NOELLE: I actually can talk, I just don't feel
like it.

3095
03:02:58,907 --> 03:03:00,986
MARISHA: It's been a long day.

3096
03:03:00,986 --> 03:03:03,985
MATT: That's even better. All right.

3097
03:03:03,985 --> 03:03:09,262
MARISHA: I move and I peek my head through the
door.

3098
03:03:09,262 --> 03:03:14,500
MATT: You can just get into this chamber with your
movement.

3099
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:23,096
MARISHA: Grog! What's going on?! You're okay? All
right.

3100
03:03:23,096 --> 03:03:26,105
TALIESIN: You know we have ear pieces, we can just
talk to each other, you are aware?

3101
03:03:26,105 --> 03:03:29,754
MARISHA: Grog! I don't know what to fucking do
right now!

3102
03:03:29,754 --> 03:03:31,202
TRAVIS: I smushed his head.

3103
03:03:31,202 --> 03:03:32,956
TALIESIN: Bring him back in.

3104
03:03:32,956 --> 03:03:37,376
MARISHA: Bring him back in! Okay! I can't move any
more, though.

3105
03:03:37,376 --> 03:03:40,714
MATT: You can if you used your action, but that's
all you'd be able to do this turn.

3106
03:03:40,714 --> 03:03:42,498
SAM: I am screaming and running at one of them.

3107
03:03:42,498 --> 03:03:45,712
MATT: Yeah, not very stealthily or manly

3108
03:03:45,712 --> 03:03:47,323
SAM: Element of surprise.

3109
03:03:47,323 --> 03:04:00,302
MARISHA: Okay. You know, there's not a lot I can
do right now, so I'm going to say, Grog! Grog! You

3110
03:04:00,302 --> 03:04:06,577
got this shit! You got it! And I'm going to cast
Enhance Ability, and I'm going to give him

3111
03:04:06,577 --> 03:04:08,951
enhanced strength.

3112
03:04:08,951 --> 03:04:15,804
MATT: So any strength checks you make are with
advantage. Though you already have that while

3113
03:04:15,804 --> 03:04:17,117
raging.

3114
03:04:17,117 --> 03:04:18,292
MARISHA: Oh wait, what?

3115
03:04:18,292 --> 03:04:20,467
MATT: When he rages he gets advantage on his
strength checks.

3116
03:04:20,467 --> 03:04:21,585
LAURA: Make him smarter!

3117
03:04:21,585 --> 03:04:23,038
TRAVIS: Smarter, handsomer, more stealthy--

3118
03:04:23,038 --> 03:04:27,504
MARISHA: Can I make him smarter? Or more stealthy?
I'm going to give him enhanced dex.

3119
03:04:27,504 --> 03:04:30,674
MATT: Okay, Cat's Grace. So you have advantage on
any stealth checks you make.

3120
03:04:30,674 --> 03:04:31,875
TRAVIS: Cool.

3121
03:04:31,875 --> 03:04:35,896
MATT: All righty, that ends Keyleth's turn. Back
to the top of the round. Percival.

3122
03:04:35,896 --> 03:04:37,594
MARISHA: You already have advantage on that too?

3123
03:04:37,594 --> 03:04:39,047
MATT: You get up, that's half your movement.

3124
03:04:39,047 --> 03:04:41,073
TALIESIN: What's to my right?

3125
03:04:41,073 --> 03:04:46,141
MATT: To your right, there is a hallway and then a
doorway.

3126
03:04:46,141 --> 03:04:49,256
TALIESIN: A hallway and a doorway?

3127
03:04:49,256 --> 03:04:50,874
MATT: Yeah. Right there.

3128
03:04:50,874 --> 03:04:56,583
TALIESIN: You know, I don't think I'm very useful
for what they're doing right now, so I'm just

3129
03:04:56,583 --> 03:05:00,669
going to do a little bit of a poke around over
there to see what's happening and listen.

3130
03:05:00,669 --> 03:05:03,970
What am I going to do, shoot a gun right
now?

3131
03:05:04,183 --> 03:05:07,244
SAM: "I invoke the second pact!"

3132
03:05:07,244 --> 03:05:18,583
TALIESIN: You can't do that. That's not how this
works. That's not how any of this works. Those

3133
03:05:18,583 --> 03:05:20,240
cages are empty?

3134
03:05:20,240 --> 03:05:21,687
MATT: These cages are empty, currently, yes.

3135
03:05:21,687 --> 03:05:23,157
TALIESIN: And that chest is closed?

3136
03:05:23,157 --> 03:05:24,904
MATT: Which one?

3137
03:05:24,904 --> 03:05:29,698
TALIESIN: That one.

3138
03:05:29,698 --> 03:05:31,614
MATT: This one is currently closed.

3139
03:05:31,614 --> 03:05:42,212
TALIESIN: I look around. I'm going to run through
into that smaller room, on the other side.

3140
03:05:42,212 --> 03:05:44,103
MATT: That's as far as you can get right there.

3141
03:05:44,103 --> 03:05:46,956
TALIESIN: I crawl up on the wall, because I can,
and watch in horror.

3142
03:05:46,956 --> 03:05:49,434
MATT: All righty, that ends your turn, Percival.
Tova.

3143
03:05:49,434 --> 03:05:52,333
NOELLE: I have a question for you real quick.

3144
03:05:52,333 --> 03:05:53,248
MATT: Yes.

3145
03:05:53,248 --> 03:05:57,368
NOELLE: I have the words, "Reroll is +25 on
weapon" written on here, under Great Weapon

3146
03:05:57,368 --> 03:05:58,835
Fighting, what does that mean?

3147
03:05:58,835 --> 03:06:01,701
MATT: That means, if you want to, on an attack,
you can take minus five to hit

3148
03:06:01,701 --> 03:06:03,971
to add ten to damage.

3149
03:06:03,971 --> 03:06:05,076
NOELLE: Okay, cool.

3150
03:06:05,076 --> 03:06:06,272
TRAVIS: It's a gamble.

3151
03:06:06,272 --> 03:06:14,395
MATT: That's Great Weapon Master. And then you
have Great Weapon Fighting, you can reroll any

3152
03:06:14,395 --> 03:06:16,895
ones or twos that you roll for damage.

3153
03:06:16,895 --> 03:06:21,055
NOELLE: Yeah, yeah, okay. Oh yeah, that's what it
says, it says, "Reroll ones and twos," not "Reroll

3154
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:36,622
"is +25." That is confusing handwriting from me. My
bad. I'm just going to charge in as a bear, and in

3155
03:06:36,622 --> 03:06:40,492
the dark, I can go ten more feet?

3156
03:06:40,492 --> 03:06:41,795
MATT: Yeah, because it's low light.

3157
03:06:41,795 --> 03:06:46,267
NOELLE: So I can go 45 feet? I assume they haven't
gone that far. Can I catch up with them?

3158
03:06:46,267 --> 03:06:48,217
SAM: Farther in the dark?

3159
03:06:48,217 --> 03:06:57,718
MATT: You rush in. The one that was initially left
is slaughtered on the ground, but as you rush

3160
03:06:57,718 --> 03:07:01,605
past, stepping over its corpse, you see another
fleshy mass lemure, the creatures that have been

3161
03:07:01,605 --> 03:07:03,575
following you around since you got here.

3162
03:07:03,575 --> 03:07:04,764
NOELLE: That's the one I'm running at, yeah?

3163
03:07:04,764 --> 03:07:05,428
MATT: Yeah.

3164
03:07:05,428 --> 03:07:07,127
NOELLE: I want to kill it.

3165
03:07:07,127 --> 03:07:08,347
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

3166
03:07:08,347 --> 03:07:15,743
NOELLE: I'm going to do that. Wait, so I'm a bear
now, so I get the Transform added to my weapon,

3167
03:07:15,743 --> 03:07:16,669
yeah?

3168
03:07:16,669 --> 03:07:19,861
MATT: Correct, you do. It's an additional plus
two.

3169
03:07:19,861 --> 03:07:28,174
NOELLE: That's 30.

3170
03:07:28,174 --> 03:07:31,386
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3171
03:07:31,386 --> 03:07:47,681
NOELLE: All right. Aw yeah. Two sixes, and that is
plus nine, so that is 21.

3172
03:07:47,681 --> 03:07:51,962
MATT: 21 points of damage. As you rush forward,
you come down with the greatsword and slice right

3173
03:07:51,962 --> 03:07:59,406
to the center of this cluster of flesh. It's just
(burbling) and falls to the ground, sloughing in

3174
03:07:59,406 --> 03:08:03,163
two pieces, quivering, and then disperses.

3175
03:08:03,163 --> 03:08:04,914
NOELLE: Do I have a bonus action?

3176
03:08:04,914 --> 03:08:07,294
MATT: You do have a bonus action, yeah.

3177
03:08:07,294 --> 03:08:12,707
NOELLE: I just want to spit on it. I hate that
guy. It's my least favorite one.

3178
03:08:12,707 --> 03:08:19,020
MATT: A big old thick bear loogie onto the corpse
as it slowly turns into a liquid. It steams as it

3179
03:08:19,020 --> 03:08:23,451
falls into the cracks and crevices of the stone
floor. All right.

3180
03:08:23,451 --> 03:08:25,195
NOELLE: Bye, motherfucker.

3181
03:08:25,195 --> 03:08:41,438
MATT: That's Tova's turn, that guy's gone. This
lemure, 15 foot of movement, another one comes up

3182
03:08:41,438 --> 03:08:48,801
behind you but it has to use all of its action to
get to you. These creatures are not very dangerous

3183
03:08:48,801 --> 03:09:01,460
if you're far away. As that shambles forward,
another winged creature turns the corner,

3184
03:09:01,460 --> 03:09:10,049
inspecting the sound, and as it turns the corner
and sees you, Taryon, shouting as you ran forward

3185
03:09:10,049 --> 03:09:12,965
with the spear, and the creature, right as you're
about to attack, gets slashed in half in front of

3186
03:09:12,965 --> 03:09:18,640
you, robbing you of your glory, you turn the
corner and see another winged humanoid, this one

3187
03:09:18,640 --> 03:09:24,628
female, with a very intense scowl on its face. You
can see the fanged teeth out of its mouth, and

3188
03:09:24,628 --> 03:09:31,239
points towards you. I need you to go ahead and
make a wisdom saving throw, with advantage.

3189
03:09:31,239 --> 03:09:34,715
SAM: 18.

3190
03:09:34,715 --> 03:09:41,865
MATT: 18, okay. You feel an influence begin to
press into your brain, drawing you into a strange

3191
03:09:41,865 --> 03:09:47,179
brain space, and you clench your eyes and force it
out, your will strong enough to resist the effect.

3192
03:09:47,179 --> 03:10:00,129
Upon seeing this fail, and your vision go clear,
it glances about and sees everyone else charging

3193
03:10:00,129 --> 03:10:08,312
into the room, and then backs up again into the
chamber this way, that far with the rest of their

3194
03:10:08,312 --> 03:10:10,065
movement, and that's as far as they get.

3195
03:10:10,065 --> 03:10:12,318
MARISHA: I feel like we're alerting the whole god
damned house.

3196
03:10:12,318 --> 03:10:14,120
TALIESIN: We gotta eventually get a candle on
this.

3197
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:16,446
MARISHA: A handle, or a candle?

3198
03:10:16,446 --> 03:10:17,616
TALIESIN: A handle and a candle.

3199
03:10:17,616 --> 03:10:19,540
MATT: That brings us to Vax.

3200
03:10:19,540 --> 03:10:23,907
LIAM: All right, I can't see too well from here,
so, from where I am, crashed in front of my

3201
03:10:23,907 --> 03:10:25,795
sister, do I see the lemure?

3202
03:10:25,795 --> 03:10:26,879
MATT: You do.

3203
03:10:26,879 --> 03:10:28,940
LIAM: All right. And am I within 60 feet?

3204
03:10:28,940 --> 03:10:30,322
MATT: You are indeed.

3205
03:10:30,322 --> 03:10:32,117
LIAM: I'm going to chuck Whisper at it.

3206
03:10:32,117 --> 03:10:38,223
MATT: All right. I will say, if you don't move,
Grog is blocking a large portion of this space so

3207
03:10:38,223 --> 03:10:40,841
I'll give you disadvantage on the attack even
though the creature's very easy to see.

3208
03:10:40,841 --> 03:10:46,307
LIAM: I'm Sharpshooter, so only full cover
affects my attacks.

3209
03:10:46,370 --> 03:10:49,886
MATT: Fair enough. So, go ahead, you're
unaffected.

3210
03:10:49,886 --> 03:10:51,637
LIAM: I got a 22.

3211
03:10:51,637 --> 03:10:53,687
MATT: 22? It hits. Go and roll damage.

3212
03:10:53,687 --> 03:10:57,837
LIAM: Okay, and I'm going to bamf there on this,
and Grog is right up against it?

3213
03:10:57,837 --> 03:11:00,952
MATT: Yes. Oh, Grog is not, Grog is about ten feet
away from it.

3214
03:11:00,952 --> 03:11:02,734
LIAM: Is anybody right next to it?

3215
03:11:02,734 --> 03:11:04,235
MATT: Tova's right next to it.

3216
03:11:04,235 --> 03:11:09,420
LIAM: All right, so that's Sneak Attack damage. So
that is four plus eight is 12, plus psychic

3217
03:11:09,420 --> 03:11:23,479
damage, that's 19, plus the Sneak Attack damage is
22, 26, 27, 32, 37, 40, 44 total.

3218
03:11:23,479 --> 03:11:31,898
MATT: Okay. You eviscerate the lemure. You watch
as you jam your dagger through it multiple times,

3219
03:11:31,898 --> 03:11:37,929
and each section you carve off of it, it splits
open, leaving these stringy tendrils of flesh and

3220
03:11:37,929 --> 03:11:46,473
tendon behind as it wails and shrieks to the
ground, slowly dissipating into a thick sludge.

3221
03:11:46,473 --> 03:11:51,120
LIAM: For my new vantage point, do I see the
winged creature that you had referenced?

3222
03:11:51,120 --> 03:11:57,131
MATT: Make a perception check. As you make a
glance around the room.

3223
03:11:57,131 --> 03:11:58,429
LIAM: That is 24.

3224
03:11:58,429 --> 03:12:00,632
MATT: 24? You unfortunately do not.

3225
03:12:00,632 --> 03:12:10,825
LIAM: All right. I am going to use my bonus action
to hide if I can. I should have full movement. Can

3226
03:12:10,825 --> 03:12:12,471
I back into a corner of the room?

3227
03:12:12,471 --> 03:12:17,233
MATT: You do, yes you can. You can back into that
corner here, and go ahead and roll your stealth.

3228
03:12:17,233 --> 03:12:21,839
LIAM: Sure. That's a 40.

3229
03:12:21,839 --> 03:12:25,403
MATT: Okay. Well, you don't get the plus ten.

3230
03:12:25,403 --> 03:12:27,121
LIAM: Oh, 30.

3231
03:12:27,121 --> 03:12:31,026
MATT: Because you already cast Hunter's Mark,
which got rid of Pass Without a Trace. So, 30. But

3232
03:12:31,026 --> 03:12:32,631
good to know. Vex, you're up.

3233
03:12:32,631 --> 03:12:37,497
LAURA: All right. I come running forward, and as
I'm running forward I bamf Trinket out of the

3234
03:12:37,497 --> 03:12:39,011
necklace.

3235
03:12:39,011 --> 03:12:47,044
MATT: That's as far as you can get there, and then
Trinket emerges in the chamber next to Grog, goes

3236
03:12:47,044 --> 03:13:00,325
over and is right next to the destroyed corpse of
the devil humanoid earlier, the face smashed in.

3237
03:13:00,325 --> 03:13:01,508
TRAVIS: Eat it.

3238
03:13:01,508 --> 03:13:04,385
LAURA: Can I say, are we in the clear? Is everyone
safe?

3239
03:13:04,385 --> 03:13:08,869
MATT: Guys, you all hear Vex say that.

3240
03:13:08,869 --> 03:13:10,616
TRAVIS: No, there's one running.

3241
03:13:10,616 --> 03:13:15,211
LAURA: Trinket, go after it! Which way did it go?

3242
03:13:15,211 --> 03:13:19,937
TRAVIS: Down the hallway to the right. Left.
Direction.

3243
03:13:19,937 --> 03:13:24,802
TALIESIN: That was helpful. That was two out of
four possible answers.

3244
03:13:24,802 --> 03:13:30,043
MATT: Trinket does manage to just catch up with
it.

3245
03:13:30,043 --> 03:13:32,539
LAURA: Oh shit, he's going to try to attack it.
Can he do that?

3246
03:13:32,539 --> 03:13:33,420
MATT: Yeah, he can.

3247
03:13:33,420 --> 03:13:36,078
LAURA: All right. Fuck, he's going to jump on it.

3248
03:13:36,078 --> 03:13:46,614
SAM: Double bear action. Bear on bear action.

3249
03:13:46,614 --> 03:13:48,057
TALIESIN: Really don't Google that.

3250
03:13:48,057 --> 03:13:53,124
SAM: Two bears wrestling with each other.

3251
03:13:53,124 --> 03:13:54,270
LAURA: 28.

3252
03:13:54,270 --> 03:13:56,727
MATT: 28 hits. Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.

3253
03:13:56,727 --> 03:13:58,797
TRAVIS: That's a really good roll for Trinket.

3254
03:13:58,797 --> 03:14:00,180
LAURA: I know!

3255
03:14:00,180 --> 03:14:03,284
MATT: Are you using your action to give him a
double attack?

3256
03:14:03,284 --> 03:14:04,008
LAURA: Yeah.

3257
03:14:04,008 --> 03:14:09,585
MATT: Okay. Because you're not actually attacking
anything. So go for it. So it's two attacks. So

3258
03:14:09,585 --> 03:14:10,941
the first one's damage?

3259
03:14:10,941 --> 03:14:15,474
LAURA: Okay, first one's damage would be 14.

3260
03:14:15,474 --> 03:14:17,122
MATT: 14, all righty.

3261
03:14:17,122 --> 03:14:22,043
LAURA: And the second one is 26.

3262
03:14:22,043 --> 03:14:23,183
MATT: 26 hits.

3263
03:14:23,183 --> 03:14:35,709
LAURA: And that's-- eight plus nine is 17.

3264
03:14:35,709 --> 03:14:42,284
MATT: 17, there you go. So look at that. So
Trinket rushes in with a double swipe. As soon as

3265
03:14:42,284 --> 03:14:47,873
the creature backs around the corner, and it goes
to turn, Trinket comes rushing around the corner

3266
03:14:47,873 --> 03:14:55,054
and tears into it with a claw and a bite into this
female devil who is pushed into the wall and torn

3267
03:14:55,054 --> 03:15:01,964
into the chest terribly. You guys just see and
hear this in the distance, you don't actually

3268
03:15:01,964 --> 03:15:05,237
watch the impact happen, but you hear the
screaming and Trinket roaring

3269
03:15:05,237 --> 03:15:06,327
as it strikes into it.

3270
03:15:06,327 --> 03:15:10,065
LAURA: Shit. Well, that's loud. Hey buddy, try to
stay quiet!

3271
03:15:10,065 --> 03:15:18,583
MATT: You get the sense that it's going to be real
hard to try to maintain a sense of stealth in this

3272
03:15:18,583 --> 03:15:24,062
stronghold now. So that ends your turn. Grog,
you're up.

3273
03:15:24,062 --> 03:15:26,875
TRAVIS: I run after--

3274
03:15:26,875 --> 03:15:28,963
LAURA: I use my bonus action to hide as well.

3275
03:15:28,963 --> 03:15:30,608
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.

3276
03:15:30,608 --> 03:15:34,016
LAURA: Unless letting Trinket out of the necklace,
does that count as my bonus action?

3277
03:15:34,016 --> 03:15:38,881
MATT: Actually, I'd probably say it's a bonus
action, yeah. Grog.

3278
03:15:38,881 --> 03:15:42,744
TRAVIS: I run after winged she-bitch.

3279
03:15:42,744 --> 03:15:48,437
MATT: Not an issue. You get up there right with
Trinket, we'll say for the purposes of this tiny

3280
03:15:48,437 --> 03:15:53,299
alley, you're in an uncomfortably close, due to
your both massive sizes, you have to move to the

3281
03:15:53,299 --> 03:15:56,994
side around Trinket and come down with the hammer
if you want.

3282
03:15:56,994 --> 03:16:07,469
TRAVIS: Yeah. Two, please. Reckless! 33.

3283
03:16:07,469 --> 03:16:08,677
MATT: That hits.

3284
03:16:08,677 --> 03:16:19,329
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, I reroll that, because that's a
one. That's a two. 18. 18 points.

3285
03:16:19,329 --> 03:16:21,547
MATT: 18 points of damage, all righty.

3286
03:16:21,547 --> 03:16:25,702
TRAVIS: Reckless. 36.

3287
03:16:25,702 --> 03:16:27,970
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3288
03:16:27,970 --> 03:16:30,336
TRAVIS: 23 points of damage.

3289
03:16:30,336 --> 03:16:40,084
MATT: All righty. As you slam into it multiple
times, the hammer reaching around the side of

3290
03:16:40,084 --> 03:16:44,872
Trinket, it's being pushed against the wall and
you can see she has this giant slash mark on the

3291
03:16:44,872 --> 03:16:48,816
chest, a big part of the neck has been torn out,
and you start bludgeoning her on the side of the

3292
03:16:48,816 --> 03:16:58,012
shoulder, and she's (growling noises) is really,
really frustrated. That ends your turn, Grog.

3293
03:16:58,012 --> 03:17:00,333
Taryon, you're up.

3294
03:17:00,333 --> 03:17:03,448
SAM: Oh, is that thing still alive, that Grog is
fighting around the corner?

3295
03:17:03,448 --> 03:17:04,889
MATT: It is.

3296
03:17:04,889 --> 03:17:05,908
SAM: Okay.

3297
03:17:05,908 --> 03:17:07,909
TRAVIS: Your turn, buddy, come on. Show me what
you got.

3298
03:17:07,909 --> 03:17:09,369
LAURA: Keep it from getting away!

3299
03:17:09,369 --> 03:17:15,863
SAM: Yeah, I'm good at that. I will run around the
corner.

3300
03:17:15,863 --> 03:17:23,969
MATT: As soon as you run around the corner, you
see this mass of fur that is Trinket, this mass of

3301
03:17:23,969 --> 03:17:32,668
muscle that is Grog, and this tiny little bit of a
devilish head of this female, as you're holding

3302
03:17:32,668 --> 03:17:34,654
your pike.

3303
03:17:34,654 --> 03:17:39,824
SAM: Do I have more movement? No, right?

3304
03:17:39,824 --> 03:17:41,311
MATT: You do have a little more movement, yeah.

3305
03:17:41,311 --> 03:17:43,032
SAM: All right, can I get up to poke it?

3306
03:17:43,032 --> 03:18:07,998
MATT: Because it is a reach weapon, you can. Over
Trinket. Go ahead and roll an attack.

3307
03:18:07,998 --> 03:18:14,161
SAM: Would it take my bonus action to say, fire,
and light my weapon on fire?

3308
03:18:14,161 --> 03:18:15,681
MATT: Yes, you can do that.

3309
03:18:15,681 --> 03:18:20,232
SAM: I'm lighting my weapon on fire and poking
it!

3310
03:18:20,232 --> 03:18:27,428
MATT: The front of it bursts into flame, and you
appear on the side. So go and roll an attack.

3311
03:18:27,428 --> 03:18:33,236
SAM: Yes, I know how to do this! Attack plus
eight, so that's 21.

3312
03:18:33,236 --> 03:18:34,446
MATT: 21 hits!

3313
03:18:34,446 --> 03:18:53,470
SAM: It's 1d12, ooh, four! Plus two magic, so
that's six! Plus 1d6! Is four! Ten!

3314
03:18:53,470 --> 03:18:58,487
MATT: Ten? All right. The fire's reduced by half,
so it's eight. Eight points of damage.

3315
03:18:58,487 --> 03:19:00,734
SAM: I'm hasted, I get another attack!

3316
03:19:00,734 --> 03:19:01,607
MATT: You do.

3317
03:19:01,607 --> 03:19:02,784
SAM: Poke again!

3318
03:19:02,784 --> 03:19:06,372
(laughter)

3319
03:19:06,372 --> 03:19:08,529
SAM: 18.

3320
03:19:08,529 --> 03:19:11,972
MATT: 18 unfortunately does not hit.

3321
03:19:11,972 --> 03:19:17,332
SAM: I feel lucky. 24.

3322
03:19:17,332 --> 03:19:18,750
MATT: That hits!

3323
03:19:18,750 --> 03:19:28,968
SAM: Ooh, ten! Ten plus two, that's 12, plus six!

3324
03:19:28,968 --> 03:19:38,542
MATT: 15, because fire, half the fire damage. As
you jam it over Trinket, the second one gets it in

3325
03:19:38,542 --> 03:19:40,293
the throat.

3326
03:19:40,293 --> 03:19:42,316
LAURA: Be dead, be dead.

3327
03:19:42,316 --> 03:19:44,901
TALIESIN: Shh, go to sleep, go to sleep.

3328
03:19:44,956 --> 03:19:52,419
MATT: That'll do it! You poke, and as the lance
slinks into the side of her throat, which is the

3329
03:19:52,419 --> 03:19:58,172
only thing you can really see at this point over
Trinket, she grabs up and instinctually catches

3330
03:19:58,172 --> 03:20:06,663
the lance. As you're pushing it in, and you shove
it in, going "Ahh!" It's like a slow Saving

3331
03:20:06,663 --> 03:20:11,898
Private Ryan knife push. She's like (gurgling
noise) and just falls limp on the edge of the

3332
03:20:11,898 --> 03:20:14,628
lance, crumples to the ground.

3333
03:20:14,628 --> 03:20:16,094
TRAVIS: Oh, nice job.

3334
03:20:16,094 --> 03:20:21,356
LAURA: Wow. Can we be quiet now?

3335
03:20:21,356 --> 03:20:23,557
TRAVIS: You should open your eyes, though.

3336
03:20:23,557 --> 03:20:30,742
SAM: Doty, take this down. I am the vanquisher of
souls.

3337
03:20:30,742 --> 03:20:36,017
MATT: Doty immediately pulls the small chamber in
the side of the torso that holds the book and--

3338
03:20:36,017 --> 03:20:40,049
SAM: And then I throw up.

3339
03:20:40,049 --> 03:20:44,593
MATT: All right, that ends Taryon's turn.
Keyleth.

3340
03:20:44,593 --> 03:20:50,356
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to back myself up in
this corner that I'm in, and I'm going to cast

3341
03:20:50,356 --> 03:20:52,985
Locate Creature.

3342
03:20:52,985 --> 03:20:56,659
MATT: Okay. What's the casting time on Locate
Creature?

3343
03:20:56,659 --> 03:21:03,602
MARISHA: Who's got the book?

3344
03:21:03,602 --> 03:21:05,753
MATT: Locate Creature? Okay, it's one action, you
can do it.

3345
03:21:05,753 --> 03:21:10,980
MARISHA: One action! It's one action, because I
knew that. And I'm going to cast, and I'm going to

3346
03:21:10,980 --> 03:21:13,555
say, Utugash.

3347
03:21:13,555 --> 03:21:22,734
MATT: Okay. You immediately sense a very large
heavy source of energy right in the center of this

3348
03:21:22,734 --> 03:21:25,487
chamber here.

3349
03:21:25,487 --> 03:21:29,907
MARISHA: (whispers) He's in the next room. He's in
the next room! Be quiet! Jesus, be quiet!

3350
03:21:29,907 --> 03:21:32,113
SAM: Who is?

3351
03:21:32,113 --> 03:21:33,954
MARISHA: Utugash!

3352
03:21:33,954 --> 03:21:38,359
LAURA: I wonder if he knows that we're here.

3353
03:21:38,359 --> 03:21:42,693
MARISHA: I look at Grog. Grog!

3354
03:21:42,693 --> 03:21:58,751
TRAVIS: Run in like a bull and fart on the wind?
Cut the throat? Bull? Flapping wings? Earache?

3355
03:21:58,751 --> 03:22:05,143
MARISHA: Utugash. Utugash! Grog! By that wall!

3356
03:22:05,143 --> 03:22:06,419
TRAVIS: Pokey poke.

3357
03:22:06,419 --> 03:22:08,110
LAURA: Why don't you just use your fucking
earring?

3358
03:22:08,110 --> 03:22:11,030
MARISHA: I'm trying, he still doesn't understand
words!

3359
03:22:11,030 --> 03:22:12,733
TRAVIS: I can hear you whispering. I don't know
why you--

3360
03:22:12,733 --> 03:22:17,934
MARISHA: He's on the other side of the wall!
Utugash!

3361
03:22:17,934 --> 03:22:19,217
TRAVIS: Oh, he's on the other side of the wall.

3362
03:22:19,217 --> 03:22:20,851
LAURA: He's in the next fucking room.

3363
03:22:20,851 --> 03:22:22,115
TRAVIS: Oh. Why didn't you just say that?

3364
03:22:22,115 --> 03:22:25,325
MARISHA: Because I was trying to be--

3365
03:22:25,325 --> 03:22:27,708
TRAVIS: What's this Tutonka thing you're doing? I
don't understand.

3366
03:22:27,708 --> 03:22:30,199
MARISHA: I was trying to be stealthy!

3367
03:22:30,199 --> 03:22:31,704
TALIESIN: Oh, Tutonka! I know Tutonka.

3368
03:22:31,704 --> 03:22:37,826
MATT: You hear a very, very faint sound of
shifting stone. It's very faint. That's it.

3369
03:22:37,826 --> 03:22:42,981
MARISHA: Shift of stones? What?

3370
03:22:42,981 --> 03:22:45,304
LAURA: We should go in the room. We should get in
now before he gets away.

3371
03:22:45,304 --> 03:22:47,142
SAM: We need to go in that room?

3372
03:22:47,142 --> 03:22:51,528
MARISHA: Do you guys want to flank? I think we can
flank. Looks like there's an

3373
03:22:51,528 --> 03:22:53,640
entrance on either side.

3374
03:22:53,640 --> 03:22:55,736
TALIESIN: Are we still in combat mode right now?

3375
03:22:55,736 --> 03:23:00,947
MATT: Currently there is no immediate threat, so
you guys can take a moment if you feel like you

3376
03:23:00,947 --> 03:23:01,778
need to.

3377
03:23:01,778 --> 03:23:03,134
LAURA: No, let's run up and get in that fucking
room.

3378
03:23:03,134 --> 03:23:05,763
LIAM: Is there anything anyone wants to do before
we go in? Last second, real quick?

3379
03:23:05,763 --> 03:23:10,305
TALIESIN: I want to check out what's still covered
by dark, very gently.

3380
03:23:10,305 --> 03:23:11,249
MATT: Which one?

3381
03:23:11,249 --> 03:23:19,146
SAM: The corner covered by the diagonal piece of
paper. Closest to me.

3382
03:23:19,146 --> 03:23:20,795
MATT: Over there? Okay.

3383
03:23:20,795 --> 03:23:22,842
NOELLE: Would I know anything about the layout of
these rooms, or just my room?

3384
03:23:22,842 --> 03:23:30,534
MATT: Just your room, that's all you're really
aware of. So as you look over in that corner, you

3385
03:23:30,534 --> 03:23:37,856
can see it's this series of five locked cell
doors. Some of them have small bars in the window,

3386
03:23:37,856 --> 03:23:40,488
some of them are just solid doors, but they're all
slammed and locked.

3387
03:23:40,488 --> 03:23:44,904
LIAM: Meantime, our friend is sealed off behind a
closed door?

3388
03:23:44,904 --> 03:23:49,276
LAURA: Yeah, we heard some stone moving, so I
think he's trying to get away.

3389
03:23:49,276 --> 03:23:51,673
MARISHA: He's in this room.

3390
03:23:51,673 --> 03:23:53,835
LIAM: There's a shut door between us and this
guy?

3391
03:23:53,835 --> 03:23:54,933
MATT: You don't know.

3392
03:23:54,933 --> 03:23:59,725
LIAM: I'm going to creep along towards our friend
there.

3393
03:23:59,725 --> 03:24:09,435
LAURA: I come in, too.

3394
03:24:09,435 --> 03:24:12,589
MATT: Okay. All right. Keyleth, are you doing
anything else?

3395
03:24:12,589 --> 03:24:17,490
MARISHA: Can I take this opportunity to do a quick
Inspiring Leader speech?

3396
03:24:17,490 --> 03:24:19,597
MATT: It takes ten minutes to do that, sorry.

3397
03:24:19,597 --> 03:24:26,828
MARISHA: Then no, I'm not going to do that, I'm
going to flank around this side a bit. Other side.

3398
03:24:26,828 --> 03:24:29,806
SAM: "Four score and-- never mind."

3399
03:24:29,806 --> 03:24:35,574
MARISHA: There might be a door over there, right?
Two doors? Is there a door on that side?

3400
03:24:35,574 --> 03:24:39,592
SAM: Are we trying to get in this room? Why don't
I just make a way in?

3401
03:24:39,592 --> 03:24:42,587
LAURA: I think there's a door right in front of
us, but yeah, we can come in the sides.

3402
03:24:42,587 --> 03:24:45,440
MARISHA: Yeah, if we can flank him, that'd be
great!

3403
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:47,112
LAURA: I'm going to follow Taryon.

3404
03:24:47,112 --> 03:24:48,443
MARISHA: Yeah, I follow.

3405
03:24:48,443 --> 03:24:51,358
SAM: I'm going to keep walking down that hall,
where we just were.

3406
03:24:51,358 --> 03:24:52,938
MARISHA: I follow Tary as well.

3407
03:24:52,938 --> 03:24:54,290
MATT: Is Tary leading the charge here?

3408
03:24:54,290 --> 03:24:55,432
SAM: As always.

3409
03:24:55,432 --> 03:24:58,853
MARISHA: Are we splitting up? Anyone going through
the door?

3410
03:24:58,853 --> 03:25:00,388
LAURA: No, I'm following fucking Tary.

3411
03:25:00,388 --> 03:25:02,972
MATT: All right, so you're following Tary,
everyone's moving over to the hallway here, then.

3412
03:25:02,972 --> 03:25:04,620
LAURA: Because this is smart.

3413
03:25:04,620 --> 03:25:06,775
MATT: Doty is pushing forward this way, Tova are
you following?

3414
03:25:06,775 --> 03:25:07,846
NOELLE: Yep.

3415
03:25:07,846 --> 03:25:08,861
MATT: All righty.

3416
03:25:08,861 --> 03:25:09,907
TALIESIN: I'm staying at the back.

3417
03:25:09,907 --> 03:25:10,936
MATT: Staying back?

3418
03:25:10,936 --> 03:25:12,794
LIAM: DM, I have no sense of where I am, because
of New Jersey. Where am I on that map?

3419
03:25:12,794 --> 03:25:14,049
SAM: You're in the back of the pack.

3420
03:25:14,049 --> 03:25:16,481
MATT: You're the back of the pack-- well, middle
of the pack right now.

3421
03:25:16,481 --> 03:25:18,544
LIAM: Oh, I meant to sneak ahead.

3422
03:25:18,544 --> 03:25:23,189
MARISHA: Can maybe Tary gives us one entrance and
then we use the actual entrance as well--

3423
03:25:23,189 --> 03:25:25,740
TRAVIS: Can I keep going, down the hallway?

3424
03:25:25,740 --> 03:25:28,569
MARISHA: -- so we're all not going into one
entrance? Flank a motherfucker?

3425
03:25:28,569 --> 03:25:31,988
MATT: Well, first and foremost--

3426
03:25:31,988 --> 03:25:35,542
TALIESIN: I didn't have a chance to peek inside
any of those doors, did I? Peek in through the

3427
03:25:35,542 --> 03:25:36,908
window of any of those doors, did I?

3428
03:25:36,908 --> 03:25:39,528
MATT: Not before you all started moving forward.
You can if you want to, but you'll stay behind

3429
03:25:39,528 --> 03:25:40,937
everyone for a little bit.

3430
03:25:40,937 --> 03:25:44,517
LIAM: Over the earring: If he knows we're here,
then all bets are off, but if he doesn't know

3431
03:25:44,517 --> 03:25:49,261
we're here, I'm going to be able to lay a massive
amount of hurt on him.

3432
03:25:49,261 --> 03:25:51,121
LAURA: I think he knows we're here.

3433
03:25:51,121 --> 03:25:52,817
TRAVIS: Tary was screaming like a woman.

3434
03:25:52,817 --> 03:25:55,643
SAM: I-- There's nothing wrong with that.

3435
03:25:55,643 --> 03:25:57,527
LIAM: What if?

3436
03:25:57,527 --> 03:25:58,861
LAURA: Number one, there isn't.

3437
03:25:58,861 --> 03:25:59,841
SAM: Women are powerful, and amazing.

3438
03:25:59,841 --> 03:26:00,940
LAURA: That's right.

3439
03:26:00,940 --> 03:26:02,476
TRAVIS: It was just very high-pitched, is what I
mean.

3440
03:26:02,476 --> 03:26:03,751
LAURA: Right, and there's nothing wrong with
that.

3441
03:26:03,751 --> 03:26:06,751
TRAVIS: Except it gives away our position in this
endeavour.

3442
03:26:06,751 --> 03:26:13,902
SAM: But did you see? I slew that-- slew? Slayed?
Is slew a past tense of slay?

3443
03:26:13,902 --> 03:26:14,970
TALIESIN: Slew.

3444
03:26:14,970 --> 03:26:20,969
NOELLE: Do I have any way of knowing if this is
Utugash in the next room? Can I do a wisdom check

3445
03:26:20,969 --> 03:26:22,659
with my bear smell?

3446
03:26:22,659 --> 03:26:26,532
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check, with
advantage because of your keen senses.

3447
03:26:26,532 --> 03:26:28,117
SAM: Bear smell!

3448
03:26:28,117 --> 03:26:31,611
NOELLE: Take that first one. Okay--

3449
03:26:31,611 --> 03:26:38,825
SAM: As Tova does this, I turn to her--

3450
03:26:38,825 --> 03:26:39,780
NOELLE: 20.

3451
03:26:39,780 --> 03:26:44,609
SAM: -- and I say, you won't pee on me will you?
I've already been marked.

3452
03:26:44,609 --> 03:26:46,248
TALIESIN: Peed on before.

3453
03:26:46,248 --> 03:26:49,453
NOELLE: Why would you ask that? What kind of stuff
do you guys do?

3454
03:26:49,453 --> 03:26:51,120
SAM: I ask that of everyone I meet.

3455
03:26:51,120 --> 03:26:53,172
NOELLE: Who are you people?

3456
03:26:53,172 --> 03:26:54,218
MATT: So what did you roll for your check?

3457
03:26:54,218 --> 03:26:55,243
NOELLE: 20.

3458
03:26:55,243 --> 03:27:00,639
MATT: 20. (sniffs) You are familiar with this
smell, Utugash. It is a combined smell of sulfur,

3459
03:27:00,639 --> 03:27:12,711
a dry earth, and grotesque decomposition. And the
smell is very strong, and you can already follow

3460
03:27:12,711 --> 03:27:16,427
the scent, it does lead into this next chamber,
which is just an open wall.

3461
03:27:16,427 --> 03:27:17,897
It isn't a door that's closed--

3462
03:27:17,897 --> 03:27:18,958
SAM: There's no door? It's just open?

3463
03:27:18,958 --> 03:27:21,043
MATT: There's no door, it's just an open wall that
leads into a chamber.

3464
03:27:21,043 --> 03:27:22,370
NOELLE: I want to kill that guy so bad.

3465
03:27:22,370 --> 03:27:23,931
MATT: Taryon, you're leading the charge, you
said?

3466
03:27:23,931 --> 03:27:27,223
LAURA: I feel like Tary, you should make a door on
the other side and then we go inside.

3467
03:27:27,223 --> 03:27:29,912
SAM: On the other side? We were there already.

3468
03:27:29,912 --> 03:27:34,618
LAURA: Right, I mean where Doty is standing right
now, if you made a door right there.

3469
03:27:34,618 --> 03:27:41,369
SAM: Why would that give us any advantage? I'm
making a door five feet away from the other door?

3470
03:27:41,369 --> 03:27:44,835
LAURA: No, that door's around where Doty is
standing, is around the corner.

3471
03:27:44,835 --> 03:27:47,480
TRAVIS: Since I'm the closest, can I step up into
the doorway and see what I see?

3472
03:27:47,480 --> 03:27:51,411
MATT: Yeah, so you step up and move. As you do, I
need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

3473
03:27:51,411 --> 03:27:54,558
MARISHA: This could be door number two over here.

3474
03:27:54,558 --> 03:27:55,572
SAM: I see.

3475
03:27:55,572 --> 03:27:57,729
MARISHA: That way we're all not crowding through
one door.

3476
03:27:57,729 --> 03:27:59,115
LAURA: Well, Grog's going into the room right
now.

3477
03:27:59,115 --> 03:27:59,991
TRAVIS: 19.

3478
03:27:59,991 --> 03:28:04,955
MATT: 19. As you step forward, something beneath
your foot (click), and you look up just as you--

3479
03:28:04,955 --> 03:28:11,337
as a piece of a circular stone opening that you
previously didn't see before, suddenly pours a

3480
03:28:11,337 --> 03:28:17,054
heavy amount of extremely hot, boiling oil down
above you, and you step back, just out of the way

3481
03:28:17,054 --> 03:28:20,789
as it splatters across the ground, sizzling
there.

3482
03:28:20,789 --> 03:28:22,675
LAURA: Oh my god. Dexterity.

3483
03:28:22,675 --> 03:28:25,519
MARISHA: Do you have advantage on that? Because of
my thing?

3484
03:28:25,519 --> 03:28:28,642
TRAVIS: Yeah! I had advantage already, but that's
cool.

3485
03:28:28,642 --> 03:28:29,843
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs)

3486
03:28:29,843 --> 03:28:32,278
MATT: Yeah, he doesn't get saving throws, he gets
skills from you, but he has advantage on saving

3487
03:28:32,278 --> 03:28:33,458
throws from traps.

3488
03:28:33,458 --> 03:28:34,610
MARISHA: Still cool.

3489
03:28:34,610 --> 03:28:37,177
TRAVIS: Do I see anything through the doorway,
from where I'm standing?

3490
03:28:37,177 --> 03:28:38,938
MATT: You step forward, make a perception check.

3491
03:28:38,938 --> 03:28:43,271
TRAVIS: Yeah, this'll be good. Oh! Hey, 18!

3492
03:28:43,271 --> 03:28:47,605
MATT: All right, as you turn around the corner and
look in, the interior is very low-lit.

3493
03:28:47,605 --> 03:28:49,366
TRAVIS: I do have Darkvision.

3494
03:28:49,366 --> 03:28:51,884
MATT: What little bit of light-- I know you have
Darkvision, but there is-- what little bit of

3495
03:28:51,884 --> 03:28:58,611
light you see is two sources of very, very low,
deep, red light. These two giant pools of some

3496
03:28:58,611 --> 03:29:03,413
thick red liquid that are just emanating this
very, very faint glow. Inside you see there is a

3497
03:29:03,413 --> 03:29:08,368
giant chair that is affixed into the center of
the chamber, as well as an altar in the center.

3498
03:29:08,586 --> 03:29:18,003
Upon this chair, you see, similar to what you
battled in the City of Brass, you see a massive

3499
03:29:18,003 --> 03:29:27,313
pit fiend, the wings lazily uncurled to each side,
the corpulent mass of it is just this giant belly

3500
03:29:27,313 --> 03:29:32,327
that hangs over the front of its knees. It
clutches to its side, and it's using currently to

3501
03:29:32,327 --> 03:29:38,293
keep one of its arms propped up, is a large axe,
and the other hand is just resting on the side of

3502
03:29:38,293 --> 03:29:43,157
the throne, and you see it just sitting there,
tapping its fingers, looking straight at you as

3503
03:29:43,157 --> 03:29:46,074
you enter-- as you step into the middle of the
hallway.

3504
03:29:46,074 --> 03:29:49,007
TRAVIS: Ooh, it's like an invitation.

3505
03:29:49,007 --> 03:29:55,495
MATT: There are a series of-- clusters of bones
throughout the entire room.

3506
03:29:55,495 --> 03:29:58,800
LAURA: Oh my lord!

3507
03:29:58,800 --> 03:30:01,735
TALIESIN: It looks like a happy little robot from
up top.

3508
03:30:01,735 --> 03:30:05,004
TRAVIS: Now that I see him, can I look to my left,
down the rest of the hallway?

3509
03:30:05,004 --> 03:30:15,182
MATT: You can, and it leads to what looks to be a
portcullis gate, an iron gate of cross bars that

3510
03:30:15,182 --> 03:30:17,227
has-- is closed currently yeah.

3511
03:30:17,227 --> 03:30:19,537
TALIESIN: Cool cool.

3512
03:30:19,537 --> 03:30:22,623
TRAVIS: A-fucking Jenga.

3513
03:30:22,623 --> 03:30:23,990
(laughter)

3514
03:30:23,990 --> 03:30:30,591
TRAVIS: And I will scoot to my left inside the
doorway but still stay in cover behind the wall.

3515
03:30:30,591 --> 03:30:32,715
No, no, to the left of the doorway but still in
the hallway.

3516
03:30:32,715 --> 03:30:37,093
MATT: I will say, it's 10:45. Do we want to pick
up at this battle moment at the

3517
03:30:37,093 --> 03:30:38,936
beginning of next week?

3518
03:30:38,936 --> 03:30:39,893
LAURA: All right, all right.

3519
03:30:39,893 --> 03:30:40,862
SAM: If Noelle is available.

3520
03:30:40,862 --> 03:30:42,047
LAURA AND MARISHA: Are you available next week?

3521
03:30:42,047 --> 03:30:43,787
NOELLE: I don't know, are you going to leave me
tied to a table?

3522
03:30:43,787 --> 03:30:44,535
SAM: No!

3523
03:30:44,535 --> 03:30:46,679
(laughter)

3524
03:30:46,679 --> 03:30:48,073
SAM: You'll start with us!

3525
03:30:48,073 --> 03:30:51,618
MARISHA: We could've found you in a magical shop.

3526
03:30:51,618 --> 03:30:53,064
TRAVIS: Nope.

3527
03:30:53,064 --> 03:30:54,722
MARISHA: We could've found you in a prison.

3528
03:30:54,722 --> 03:31:00,158
TALIESIN: Could've been drinking in a bar, like a
normal person, but no, tied to a chair.

3529
03:31:00,158 --> 03:31:01,781
NOELLE: Just an extra night of torture, it's no
big deal.

3530
03:31:01,781 --> 03:31:03,190
TRAVIS: Just an hour and 40 minutes to sign a
contract.

3531
03:31:03,190 --> 03:31:07,140
NOELLE: Take your time! I'll be around, I want to
kill this guy.

3532
03:31:07,140 --> 03:31:08,390
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Yeah!

3533
03:31:08,390 --> 03:31:15,089
MATT: All right, so we'll have Noelle back for
next week. We'll pick up right at the encounter

3534
03:31:15,089 --> 03:31:18,013
with Utugash, within his stronghold.

3535
03:31:18,013 --> 03:31:19,236
TALIESIN: Uragash.

3536
03:31:19,236 --> 03:31:21,983
MATT: Oh man, this'll be fun.

3537
03:31:21,983 --> 03:31:25,002
MARISHA: I think I called him U-tu-gash, because
that's what I wrote down.

3538
03:31:25,002 --> 03:31:26,034
MATT: Utugash.

3539
03:31:26,034 --> 03:31:27,268
MARISHA: Like Uta Hagen, but Utugash.

3540
03:31:27,268 --> 03:31:29,424
MATT: U-T-U-G-A-S-H.

3541
03:31:29,424 --> 03:31:32,972
MARISHA: Oh, it is U-T-U, Utugash. Okay.

3542
03:31:32,972 --> 03:31:37,847
MATT: You did good, you did good. (laughs) But
yeah, we'll pick this up next week, jumping into

3543
03:31:37,847 --> 03:31:43,495
this fray. Thank you guys so much for watching,
thank you so much for playing, guys. Thank you

3544
03:31:43,495 --> 03:31:49,265
Loot Crate for being our awesome sponsor. And
we'll see you guys-- we'll be there at Wondercon

3545
03:31:49,265 --> 03:31:50,771
this Saturday, 2PM.

3546
03:31:50,771 --> 03:31:51,658
LAURA: Oh, jeez.

3547
03:31:51,658 --> 03:31:54,147
MATT: Yeah-yeah! Yeah! Two o'clock.

3548
03:31:54,147 --> 03:31:55,142
MARISHA: Big room.

3549
03:31:55,142 --> 03:32:00,864
MATT: The arena. All right, folks, have a
wonderful night, sleep well and is it Thursday

3550
03:32:00,864 --> 03:32:02,341
yet? Good night.

3551
03:32:02,341 --> 03:32:03,372
TALIESIN: Night!

3552
03:32:03,372 --> 03:32:04,571
TRAVIS: Nice!

3553
03:32:04,571 --> 03:39:09,441
