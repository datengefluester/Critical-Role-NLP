1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:03,031
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:11,452
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. This
evening, we're about to dive into our final game

3
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:17,109
of the year before we go away for the holidays,
and then return in the new year to begin our new

4
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:23,481
campaign. So tonight, instead, we're going to have
the members of Vox Machina who could be here--

5
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:29,157
unfortunately, Ashley is still in New York. Laura
is busy being at the Video Game Awards because she

6
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:37,092
was nominated for Best Actress. So we're sending
all the awesome, positive thoughts her way and

7
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:43,275
wishing her luck. And we all knew Vex was going to
go out in the first half anyway. That's not true.

8
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:51,971
But we miss you, Laura. We do have a sponsor
tonight. We have, for this fantastic episode,

9
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:57,663
Marvel Puzzle Quest returns to sponsor an episode.
Thank you so much, Marvel Puzzle Quest! Sam?

10
00:00:57,663 --> 00:01:05,443
SAM: Guys, for the sponsorship opportunity, I know
that I have this habit of doing a bit, doing some

11
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:11,230
comedy at the top of the show, and it's all funny
and clever and brilliant and all that. But today,

12
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:18,862
I'm just going to do it serious. This is a serious
sponsor and they need our serious, unadulterated

13
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:24,488
attention. So I'm just going to read the copy, I
swear to god. Okay. Our sponsor tonight is Marvel

14
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:32,226
Puzzle Quest. Recruit all your favorite Avengers,
from Black Panther, Captain America, (fart noise)

15
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:38,898
Iron Man, The Hulk (fart noise), Black Widow, and
more! (extended fart) Create a super-villain dream

16
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:49,760
team and recruit Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Thanos
to wage your own war! (excessive fart noises) Mix

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,608
and match to create the ultimate team of three,
and battle it out in Match Three War! (squeaky fart)

18
00:01:55,608 --> 00:02:05,202
Marvel Puzzle Quest is available on iOS,
Android, Amazon, and Steam. Download it now for

19
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:11,588
free. (so many fart noises)

20
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,530
MATT: God, Sam, holy shit.

21
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,820
SAM: I just read the copy!

22
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,050
MARISHA: Your own joke broke you.

23
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,477
TALIESIN: What episode is this?! How many episodes
did it take to finally get to this?

24
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,415
TRAVIS: Marvel Puzzle Quest gets the best stuff.

25
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:32,226
MATT: We have officially hit <i>that</i> level in our
game.

26
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,601
TALIESIN: We have steamed the shark.

27
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:39,487
LIAM: You've got to be careful. Marvel Marketing
is going to start stealing from your bucket of

28
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,767
tricks. We're going to see trailers with farts.

29
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:50,738
MATT: All righty. So let's see. Other
announcements? We have a quick one tonight, I

30
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,076
think.

31
00:02:52,076 --> 00:03:02,906
MARISHA: There's the charity stream with Satine on
Saturday. The Roll20 dealio that she's doing is

32
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,025
this Saturday, all-day D&amp;D for charity.

33
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:08,884
MATT: This is actually a continuation of a charity
event that Satine's been running for years, where

34
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:14,734
me and her first played D&amp;D together years ago.
She asked me to be a charity DM and me and Keith

35
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:20,276
Baker ran games at Meltdown, years ago. So it's an
awesome group, awesome games. Please check it out.

36
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,871
Support it if you can.

37
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:25,572
MARISHA: That was the early days of streaming RPGs
online, before it was a thing.

38
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:35,414
MATT: Yeah, it was rough. But it was fun. It was a
good time. So yeah, check that out. Next Thursday

39
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:40,056
will be our big wrap-up. We've been asking
questions of the community. There's been a lot of

40
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:46,778
really great questions. So we got through as many
as we possibly can for this episode next Thursday

41
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:49,467
to answer a lot of questions about the campaign,
the world, things that went unanswered,

42
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:55,146
curiosities that you may have been holding on to.
The ones that we didn't get to, we might carry

43
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:58,855
over into the first week of the new year or
something. We'll figure it out. We want to get

44
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:03,142
through as many of these as we can, but we have a
large bulk of them coming to you next Thursday in

45
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:09,125
this time slot. So check it out next week! Let's
see. Any other announcements you guys want to

46
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,545
bring up?

47
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:14,243
TRAVIS: Laura would pull my lower lip over my head
if I didn't say that the beautiful Critical Role

48
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:20,693
notebook is in the merch store. It's gorgeous. I
don't hold it up and Vanna White it as nice as she

49
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:27,844
does, but it's in there. Laura and I will be at
SacAnime in Sacramento the first week of January.

50
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:32,111
January 5th through the 7th, I think it is. We'll
be in Sacramento.

51
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:40,192
MATT: Also, me and Marisha are both happy to be
hosting with the folks who make Gwent. If you're

52
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,441
familiar with the Witcher, they have their own
card game.

53
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,113
LIAM: You don't like Witcher, though.

54
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:49,574
MATT: Yeah, I'm not a fan. But we're helping host
their upcoming Gwent tournament next weekend,

55
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:55,543
Friday and Saturday. I can't really say the
specifics of it because they're going to announce

56
00:04:55,543 --> 00:05:03,499
it on their own time, but it's going to be fun.
Somewhere in the Europes. But yes, we'll be there.

57
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:09,528
We'll have information on our Twitters and social
media if you want to follow and check out both

58
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:13,092
Gwent. We're streaming tomorrow morning, actually,
our last stream of us getting prepped, and we're

59
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:16,141
meeting with a bunch of guys in the community that
are showing us the ins and outs of some of the

60
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:23,479
factions and decks. So if you're like us and up
early tomorrow on Twitch, we'll be there. We'll

61
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,416
figure out all of the information on Twitter. All
right. Anything else, guys?

62
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:35,597
TALIESIN: Did podcast get updated, or did that not
happen? It may not have.

63
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:37,173
MARISHA: It's coming.

64
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:43,382
TALIESIN: Comic book issue three is available.
It's beautiful. And there's now two playlists out

65
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:46,072
because I didn't announce my playlist last week.
Percy's playlist went out and now there's a Vex

66
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,891
podcast.

67
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:54,670
MARISHA: I'm working on it. I started writing
today.

68
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,804
TRAVIS: I don't have one because it was going to
be all death metal, followed with nursery rhymes.

69
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:03,333
TALIESIN: I would like to know what kind of death
metal you're into.

70
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,325
TRAVIS: Technonic.

71
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:13,617
MARISHA: Also, big deal. This is a big one.
Talking about merch. This is a true story. We

72
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:22,486
found a bunch of extra David Mack posters that we
autographed and signed as hold-over, in case

73
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:28,984
anything was damaged or shipping was messed up.
Yeah, in case life happened. So we signed about a

74
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:34,359
hundred extra and we magically found them the
other day. So your last chance--

75
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,340
SAM: Can you tell me where we found them?

76
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,614
MARISHA: It was somewhere, I think, literally in
the boiler room.

77
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:43,877
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was about to say, it was
probably the boiler room because that's where shit

78
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:48,999
goes and vanishes. We are kind of a mess on
occasion, this is true.

79
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,011
MARISHA: No, we're a web company. We wouldn't be a
mess.

80
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:57,906
MATT: Individually and as a collective fumbling
our way through existence day to day.

81
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:03,044
MARISHA: But anyway, they are in the store right
now. This is your last chance. If you're like, "Oh

82
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:09,791
"no, I saw them!" But only a hundred-- and they're
gone. So yeah, last-minute Christmas present for

83
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,803
anyone who was looking for something.

84
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:21,067
LIAM: Marisha and I came out in another episode of
Madness. Some more improvised gameplay with

85
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,213
blocks.

86
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:24,721
MARISHA: If you're not watching it, holy crap. Go
watch it.

87
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:32,013
MATT: Awesome. All right. I believe that brings us
to the conclusion of our announcements. And

88
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:40,110
finishing that up, let's bring us to tonight's
special Level 20 Battle Royale episode of Critical

89
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,792
Role.

90
00:07:41,792 --> 00:09:11,220
[dramatic music]

91
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,728
MATT: Welcome back, as apparently Sam transformed
into his ultimate, final form.

92
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:21,919
SAM: The King of Egos.

93
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,488
MATT: How many is this?

94
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,334
TALIESIN: It's Sams all the way down.

95
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,587
SAM: There are six pictures of me, plus me, so
that's seven. Lucky seven.

96
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:47,519
MATT: Seven Sams, that's your name for the night.
Seventh Sam-urai. So folks. Not long--

97
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,448
SAM: Wait a second. You're doing a story? I
thought we were just going to kill each other!

98
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:54,428
MATT: There's a narrative.

99
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,277
TALIESIN: Let him paint his picture.

100
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,645
LIAM: Have you met Matt?

101
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:06,446
MATT: Not long before you finish your preparations
for the final battle with Vecna, you all spent an

102
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:14,968
evening going to rest with unease and as sleep
took you, a vision fills your mind. Groggily you

103
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:22,394
come to, wiping the insides of your eyelids,
trying to find some means of grasping the scenario

104
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:32,045
around you. As unfamiliar smells of stale water
and crushed stone begin to fill your sinuses, the

105
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:39,344
light blearing into your vision, you slowly focus
to look around you and find a strange assortment

106
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:47,989
of structures in the vicinity. And there above
you, cracking through the clouds with a thunderous

107
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:55,403
boom, you see a cloaked figure descend from the
heavens, hands held aloft, palms up to the sky as

108
00:10:55,403 --> 00:11:05,697
bolts of energy arc around its form. As it slowly
drifts, hovering above this central tower, the

109
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:12,611
sconces of flame below burning with embers that
drift up with the wind and vanish. The cloaked

110
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:20,360
figure spins around, revealing the face beneath
the hood, a well groomed, beautiful, familiar

111
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,760
beard and his perfectly combed hair.

112
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,959
SAM: Oh, I feel better now.

113
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,729
MATT: One side of his body contains unique armor
with a series of spines of metal seemingly

114
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:35,218
protruding into his arm, as if to keep it in
place.

115
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:38,208
(laughter)

116
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,024
TRAVIS: Amazing.

117
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:49,129
MATT: As he spins around, making eye contact with
the five of you members of Vox Machina, his voice

118
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:58,411
billows out, "You've come again. And here you are,
and since you're here I think it's time that you

119
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:06,775
"show me what you've got. Show me what you've got!"
With a thunderous clap he vanishes. You see a

120
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:11,859
singular column of green energy left behind where
he stood, that now rests upon the top of the

121
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:18,514
pillar. You watch as these two disparate towers on
two ends of the battlefield begin to slowly spin

122
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:26,435
as energy crackles throughout them. You look
around the field for any sort of view of your

123
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:31,473
opponents and all you see are your friends, and
you know in that moment that this is another

124
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:39,261
challenge from the Great Colville, to show who
amongst you is most powerful.

125
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:41,030
MARISHA: Not again.

126
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,363
LIAM: But if we know that in advance.

127
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:49,331
MATT: His voice cracks out from the heavens, "Roll
initiative."

128
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,657
MARISHA: Wait, do we have time to precast?

129
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:54,589
LIAM: No.

130
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:55,844
MARISHA: To do like a little--

131
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,817
LIAM: Take your precast and shove it in your ass,
Keyleth.

132
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,344
SAM: Like you need something else.

133
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,952
LIAM: You need an edge on us all?

134
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:06,346
MARISHA: Yes, I do! It's not my fault that my
character's awesome.

135
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:08,534
LIAM: Using my first luck of the day at the top.

136
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:13,050
SAM: Can I inspire myself on this roll? I forget,
it's an ability check.

137
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,402
MATT: It's an ability check, yeah.

138
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,980
SAM: I will inspire myself.

139
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,093
MARISHA: Can I give myself an inspiring leader
speech?

140
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:19,252
MATT: No.

141
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:22,742
LIAM: That's ten minutes.

142
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:25,624
MARISHA: Come on, you got this, come on, come on.
You can do this, you can do this.

143
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:32,834
LIAM: I'm one luck down.

144
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,369
SAM: One inspiration down.

145
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:36,770
MATT: I'm checking real fast here, hold onto your
numbers for a moment.

146
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:45,127
LIAM: In my luck box. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven.

147
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,630
SAM: Wait, wait, that's too many.

148
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,544
(laughter)

149
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:52,093
MATT: Which can include yourself.

150
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:58,106
SAM: Shit, I forget what Mythcarver does.

151
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,301
TRAVIS: You've used it twice!

152
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:04,966
MATT: I'll put it this way, does everybody have
something they wish to prepare before the battle?

153
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:09,976
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

154
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:17,758
MATT: And as a note, whatever potions that you had
on yourself that are healing potions, are out of

155
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:21,155
this battle, as you check your contents of your
pockets.

156
00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:27,912
TRAVIS: I mean, not really. I want to rage, that's
it.

157
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:30,764
TALIESIN: The only thing I can think to do is I
would want to already have my Boots of Spider

158
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:34,766
Climbing activated and my Diplomacy charged.

159
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:38,614
MARISHA: How about, instead of a speech, can I
cast Freedom of Movement on myself?

160
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:39,849
MATT: Sure.

161
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:42,947
LIAM and MATT: Wings are already out.

162
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,219
TRAVIS: Do you want to cast freedom of movement on
me?

163
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,094
TALIESIN: We get to pose before the battle right?

164
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,635
MARISHA: I think I'm the only one here, I don't
know, I can't.

165
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:53,394
MATT: As you take in the gravity of the situation you
can see a small sparkle around you as a

166
00:14:53,394 --> 00:15:01,626
containment field marks the exterior of this
battlefield both around and roughly 80 to 100 feet

167
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,889
in the air.

168
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,334
TRAVIS: 80 to 100 feet?

169
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:06,510
MATT: Yeah.

170
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,832
TALIESIN: Find out the hard way.

171
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:11,997
TRAVIS: I won't. I ain't going up there.

172
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:14,911
MATT: Initiative orders. 25 to 20.

173
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:17,549
SAM: (laughing) Everybody.

174
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,006
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

175
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:20,197
SAM: Everybody but Kiki.

176
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:21,347
SAM: 21!

177
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:22,138
MARISHA: I rolled pretty good, too.

178
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:23,392
TRAVIS: 20.

179
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:24,593
TALIESIN: 24.

180
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:34,288
MATT: All right, so we have currently Percy at 24,
Scanlan at 21, Grog at 20.

181
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:39,623
LIAM: 19.

182
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:42,338
MARISHA: Also 19.

183
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:44,991
LIAM: Oh, fuck you. Give it to me. She doesn't
need it.

184
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:49,182
MARISHA: Bullshit! Bullshit! Fucking Mr. Sneak
Attack!

185
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:53,181
LIAM: (laughing) What are you talking about? You
are the clear winner of this game!

186
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,728
MARISHA: Don't say that! I've lost all of them!

187
00:15:55,728 --> 00:16:01,548
MATT: I would like you both, right now, to roll a
dexterity check. Roll a d20, add your dexterity

188
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,136
modifier.

189
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,088
TALIESIN: He may have to burn another luck.

190
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,508
LIAM: Nope.

191
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,984
MARISHA: Just my modifier, my straight modifier?

192
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:11,659
MATT: Yep. Because technically you're on the same
initiative, but I can't have you doing your

193
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,005
actions at the exact same time. This is to see
who's slightly faster.

194
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,807
MARISHA: I rolled a 15, for 17 total.

195
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,545
LIAM: 32, motherfucker.

196
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,055
SAM: Jesus! That's your wife!

197
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,920
MATT: Wait. How'd you get 32?

198
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,399
LIAM: I rolled a 19, my dex is a 13.

199
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,838
MARISHA: That's your saving throw.

200
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,580
MATT: That's your saving throw, it's a dexterity
check.

201
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,426
LIAM: Still higher than you.

202
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,640
MATT: Still higher.

203
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,848
LIAM: 19. It's a saving throw?

204
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:39,517
MATT: No, it's just an ability check.

205
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:40,482
LIAM: Oh, okay.

206
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,977
MATT: You're fine, you beat Keyleth.

207
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:43,495
MARISHA: Learn your character sheet,
motherfucker!

208
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,466
(laughing)

209
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:53,898
MATT: So there is a burst of speed and Vax is ever
so faster than Keyleth. His dextrous capabilities

210
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:58,630
edge her out of the initiative order, so Keyleth,
you're taking up the rear.

211
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,466
MARISHA: I was so stoked about my 17.

212
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:06,249
MATT: I know. With that, as those two towers are
currently crackling, Percival, it's your turn.

213
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:08,363
TALIESIN: Wow, it's been a while.

214
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:13,974
SAM: I don't know how to play this character
anymore. I've totally forgotten everything I can

215
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:15,034
do.

216
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,186
MARISHA: This is the last time we're going to play
these characters.

217
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:20,443
TALIESIN: I'm going to run into this room and I
want to see what's inside this building.

218
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:31,223
MATT: All right. So you rush around. That's about
as far as you get with your movement. Looking

219
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:41,292
inside, you see a large cluster of sigils carved
into the ground with crystals sticking out and

220
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:46,548
it's this low pulsing purple energy. Make a
perception check, actually.

221
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:47,860
TALIESIN: All right.

222
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,744
LIAM: Castlevania teleport mode.

223
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:54,797
TALIESIN: 23.

224
00:17:54,797 --> 00:18:00,997
MATT: 23. You notice a small groove of similar
pulsing kind of purplish-blue energy that runs

225
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:07,036
from the circle and out of the chamber, which is
this line here. And then you also barely see on

226
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:13,795
the edge what appears to be an archway, a door
that is built that has a slight shifting barrier

227
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:15,577
of mist where the archway is.

228
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:18,530
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend the rest of my action
moving into the archway of mist.

229
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,499
MATT: You move into the archway?

230
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,336
TALIESIN: Yeah.

231
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:27,283
MATT: Okay, and with that you move here.

232
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:30,742
TALIESIN: How much movement do I have left?

233
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:35,199
MATT: That's where it puts you.

234
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,841
TALIESIN: All right.

235
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:42,030
MATT: And having revealed those two elements of
the battlefield. Going to leave those two open for

236
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,568
the time, but there is a roof up there about ten
feet tall. End of your turn?

237
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:48,644
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

238
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,353
MATT: Okay. Scanlan, you're up.

239
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:51,837
TALIESIN: You don't see me.

240
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:56,524
SAM: I'm going to turn invisible.

241
00:18:56,524 --> 00:19:00,116
MATT: Okay, you cast Invisibility on yourself.
That's your action.

242
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:08,146
SAM: And I'm going to pick a direction to run in.
I don't see anybody. I'm going to pick a random

243
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:13,193
direction. That's right. I'm going to run to the
right. Is this a door that I can get in?

244
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,763
MATT: That is currently a door.

245
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:16,161
SAM: Currently a door?

246
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,395
MATT: Meaning it is a door.

247
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:24,222
SAM: I'll run over that way. I only go 25 feet. Or
25 things.

248
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:27,835
TALIESIN and MATT: 25.

249
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,406
SAM: And bonus action I can't dash, right, no?

250
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,065
MATT: No. You're not a rogue, buddy, no. Sorry.

251
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:33,853
SAM: I don't know. I've never dashed!

252
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:36,157
(laughter)

253
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:39,207
MATT: However, you are currently considered
invisible.

254
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:43,505
TALIESIN: Do you have a thingy for that? I have a
cake.

255
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:51,408
MATT: It's been a few weeks since we played and I
left my markers at home. But that's okay. That

256
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:56,655
cake means you're invisible. It's an invisibility
cake. All right, finishing Scanlan's turn. Grog,

257
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,961
you're up.

258
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:03,321
TRAVIS: Raging, can I run around the side of the
tower that's closest to you towards the door of

259
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:05,172
this little Superman shaped-- yep.

260
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,396
MATT: 30, you're at the door.

261
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:13,317
TRAVIS: Can I use siege to knock the fucking door
open?

262
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,462
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack against the
door.

263
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:20,079
SAM: Are we hearing things? Can we hear the crack
of wood?

264
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,843
TRAVIS: 20.

265
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:27,872
MATT: 20, go ahead and roll damage. You now hear a
thunderous roar, Grog's voice billowing out from

266
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:35,996
the air not too far from you across a moat-like
pond of clear water that surrounds the vicinity of

267
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:41,411
the central tower. With a smashing sound, you see
wood splinter off into the air.

268
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:44,019
TRAVIS: A d4 for the fit hands or with the axe?

269
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:45,417
MATT: With the axe.

270
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:53,136
TRAVIS: Oh, shit balls ass, sorry. Nope, that's a
ten. Eight plus--

271
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,380
MATT: This is the Bloodaxe?

272
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,409
TRAVIS: Yeah.

273
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:56,517
MATT: Bloodaxe is a d12.

274
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:58,391
TRAVIS: It is, right, I was using the sword before
that.

275
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,977
MATT: Yeah, d12. What did you roll?

276
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:10,020
TRAVIS: That's an eight on both of them, plus--
Sorry, been a hot minute. 23.

277
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,579
MATT: 23, double eight? Yeah, the door is
destroyed. It's blown inside, the hinges kind of

278
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,663
(squeaking sound) and what little bit of the door
still remains kind of breaks off and slams into

279
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:26,378
the ground, and revealing the interior of this
chamber, the door now open. It is empty except for

280
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:29,331
a singular chest sitting in the far corner from
you.

281
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:33,531
TRAVIS: Do I have any movement left? What did I
end on, 40?

282
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:35,488
MATT: That was 30, you still have 20 feet of
movement.

283
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,151
TRAVIS: Can I make my way to the chest?

284
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:39,078
MATT: Yes you can.

285
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:41,920
TRAVIS: And it's not a bonus action to open said
chest, right?

286
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,126
MATT: Nope, that would be an action.

287
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:44,162
TRAVIS: I'll stay in my room!

288
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:44,965
MATT: Okay.

289
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:46,313
TRAVIS: Can I shut the door-- the door's gone.

290
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:48,053
(laughter)

291
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:57,333
MATT: At this point, both of the towers-- the
sparking energy arcs outward and nobody's in the

292
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,333
vicinity, so no worries there.

293
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,952
SAM: Oh boy!

294
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:05,545
MATT: You watch as energy sparks offward and hits
the other structures nearby and then eventually

295
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:13,400
pulls back into the towers and the glow is slowly
building once more. Vax, you're up.

296
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,095
LIAM: Okay, I am sending you something. I'm going
to use a bonus action to hide.

297
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:19,730
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check, please.

298
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,717
LIAM: Sure. Nobody can see me, right?

299
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,490
MATT: Not at the moment.

300
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,978
LIAM: Okay, that is a 27.

301
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:29,904
MATT: Okay.

302
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:39,745
LIAM: Here it comes to you. And I've charted this
right, I think.

303
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:42,200
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

304
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,856
SAM: Are we playing Battleship now? Are you
sending him moves? Is this what's happening?

305
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:49,304
LIAM: Yes.

306
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:58,205
MATT: Okay, Vax vanishes into the shadows of the
field. Let's see here.

307
00:22:58,205 --> 00:23:04,148
LIAM: Feel me?

308
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:05,586
MATT: Yeah.

309
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,726
LIAM: Okay.

310
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:09,037
MATT: That your turn?

311
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:14,453
LIAM: Oh, shite. Yes it is.

312
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:17,473
MATT: Okay, ends Vax's turn, Keyleth, you're up.

313
00:23:17,473 --> 00:23:21,424
MARISHA: Hey, question, clarification on
blindsight?

314
00:23:21,424 --> 00:23:23,340
MATT: Yes?

315
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:30,512
MARISHA: I was going to look it up. You're blind
but you can still see through you being awesome?

316
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:34,193
MATT: Is this in reference to a creature?

317
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:35,451
MARISHA: Yeah.

318
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:42,988
MATT: Blindsight means that they either don't use
their eyes to see and as such Blind doesn't affect

319
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,046
them.

320
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,635
TRAVIS: Oh, like the worms and stuff.

321
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:50,373
MATT: Yeah. Creatures without eyes, such as
grimlocks, grey oozes, either it's naturally blind

322
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:57,065
and can see without having to use the eyes or if
it's ever blinded it doesn't affect it.

323
00:23:57,065 --> 00:24:00,419
MARISHA: Okay, so I wouldn't be able to see
through Scanlan's Invisibility with blindsight.

324
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,776
MATT: Not with blindsight, with tremor sense you
would still feel him running across.

325
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:13,566
MARISHA: That's what I was getting clarification
on. I am going to cast Sunbeam at 6th level,

326
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:15,870
and--

327
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,166
MATT: Where are you casting it?

328
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,973
MARISHA: Sunbeam. Myself.

329
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:24,818
MATT: Right. It creates a beam when you cast it.

330
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:30,846
MARISHA: As an action I get to create a beam,
right?

331
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:35,038
MATT: Correct, but when you initially cast it you
create a beam so if you want to fire at wherever

332
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,598
and it's gone, that's fine.

333
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:42,353
MARISHA: Okay. Well then, how about this? I want
to peek around this corner over here.

334
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:46,895
SAM: My tremor sense hears her moving.

335
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:49,117
MARISHA: Do I see Percy?

336
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:51,914
MATT: Yeah, you very plainly see Percy.

337
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:54,698
MARISHA: Okay, then I'm going to do Sunbeam.

338
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:56,456
TALIESIN: That'll do.

339
00:24:56,456 --> 00:25:03,565
MATT: All right. First blood. Other than the door.
Which, to be fair, is the most Vox Machina opening

340
00:25:03,565 --> 00:25:06,114
thing to destroy.

341
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:09,097
TRAVIS: This is for 115 episodes, you bitch!

342
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:10,839
MARISHA: Did I destroy the door? Is that what
you're saying?

343
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,565
MATT: No, Travis did earlier.

344
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:14,311
TRAVIS: You didn't destroy everything!

345
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:16,161
MARISHA: Sorry, I checked out.

346
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:17,937
(laughter)

347
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:22,566
MATT: All right, Percy, I need you to make a
constitution saving throw, please.

348
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:24,988
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. This is
magical, isn't it?

349
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:26,072
MATT: Yes, it is.

350
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:27,644
TALIESIN: So I get advantage on this.

351
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:28,496
MATT: You do.

352
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:29,992
MARISHA: Is that versus my spell level?

353
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:31,230
MATT: Yep, your spell DC.

354
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,217
TALIESIN: What's your spell DC? Oh, okay,
constitution saving throw.

355
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:34,453
MARISHA: It's pretty high.

356
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:40,193
TALIESIN: 25.

357
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:41,522
MATT: 25, I think that saves.

358
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:44,371
MARISHA: That hits, so you are not blinded but you
do still take the damage.

359
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,128
TALIESIN: How much damage?

360
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,333
MATT: Half as much damage.

361
00:25:47,333 --> 00:26:06,332
MARISHA: Half as much. 6d8 radiant. (counting) 33
damage total.

362
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:10,408
MATT: 33 damage. Half that. You take 16 points of
radiant damage.

363
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:12,291
TALIESIN: I'll take 16 points of radiant damage.

364
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:20,464
MARISHA: And then I use my bonus action to turn
into an earth elemental. I still have a little bit

365
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,171
of movement, right?

366
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:23,486
MATT: You do.

367
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:27,923
MARISHA: I'm going to use the rest of my movement
to peek back around there.

368
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:32,758
SAM: How big is that thing?

369
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,776
MATT: It's considered a large creature.

370
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:36,541
SAM: Is it taller than the roof?

371
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:46,022
MATT: No. Because about ten feet tall, it's about
as tall as the roof. But you do see Keyleth come

372
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:51,314
out of the side, blast a Sunbeam-- Your line of
sight over there, you barely see her rush around

373
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:55,808
the corner, fire this beam of energy, and then
(whooshing) into an elemental and then curl around

374
00:26:55,808 --> 00:26:58,472
the way.

375
00:26:58,472 --> 00:26:59,921
SAM: Nice! Just going to crack my knuckles then.

376
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:01,670
MATT: Ending Keyleth's turn, Percy you're up.

377
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:08,346
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop right back through that
door, and take a right out that door and start

378
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:16,033
heading back out that-- yeah, right there, and
then I'm going to use the rest of my-- to cast

379
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:25,199
Silence. I'm casting my silence ball, I am now
completely quiet.

380
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:27,197
SAM: Except for tremor sense.

381
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:28,795
TRAVIS: Where'd he go?

382
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:30,211
MATT: You don't know where he went.

383
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,455
TRAVIS: Oh, he's off the map? Oh, there he is.

384
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:32,641
(laughter)

385
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:34,564
MATT: So Percy has Silence on him, Scanlan, you're
up.

386
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:43,200
SAM: Okay. Shoot! I saw her. (to Marisha) I saw
you!

387
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,773
MARISHA: I saw you!

388
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:53,365
SAM: Let's see here, 25 feet gets me to either
here or here, right?

389
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:59,386
MATT: I mean, 25 would put you-- almost.

390
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,035
SAM: But I can't get somewhere where I can see
her.

391
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:05,711
MATT: Not at the moment, it doesn't look like. You
know where she went, but you don't see her.

392
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:11,803
SAM: As I walk, I will try that door, see if it
opens. Does it open?

393
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:14,054
MATT: You walk up to the door, and you're going to
try it?

394
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:15,089
SAM: Yeah.

395
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,145
MATT: No, it's locked.

396
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:18,928
SAM: Then I'm going to keep going and get to
here.

397
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:20,519
TALIESIN: That's as far as you can go.

398
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,574
SAM: You said 20!

399
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,685
MATT: 25.

400
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,452
TALIESIN: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25. To the door.

401
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,052
SAM: I thought you said I could get to either here
or here!

402
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:29,391
MATT: Little gnome feet.

403
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:44,154
SAM: Okay, I will use my action to cast Minor
Illusion and it's going to be Scanlan's voice

404
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:49,891
coming from right here behind where she can't see,
singing a little song.

405
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:52,277
MATT: Okay.

406
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:57,764
SAM: Minor Illusion I don't think is
concentration, right? It just says one action.

407
00:28:57,764 --> 00:29:02,212
MATT: Do be aware--

408
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:08,981
LIAM: Heads up guys, my only chance of surviving
to the halfway mark of this game--

409
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,459
MATT: Invisibility ends when you cast a spell.

410
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:11,692
SAM: Oh, when you cast any spell.

411
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:12,509
MATT: Any spell.

412
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:13,717
SAM: Ugh, shit, I always do this!

413
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:14,883
MATT: I know.

414
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:18,412
LIAM: My only chance of survival to the halfway
mark is hiding, so Matt and I will be doing a

415
00:29:18,412 --> 00:29:22,737
little bit of texting this evening so I can
telegraph my moves until somebody spots me.

416
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:24,065
TRAVIS: Totally dick pics, right?

417
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:26,989
LIAM: Yeah-- no! That's <i>crazy!</i>

418
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:29,005
MARISHA: Right under the table. Live dick pics.

419
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:37,090
SAM: Then I will save my action until I see
someone, I guess.

420
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,695
MATT: What are you holding your action then?

421
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:45,834
SAM: No! No, sorry Matt! Sorry! I'm new to this
game! I'm going to use my action to dash, right? I

422
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:47,158
get more movement!

423
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:47,961
MATT: Yeah.

424
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,255
SAM: I go back here.

425
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:53,812
TALIESIN: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25!

426
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:55,674
SAM: Out of sight of her.

427
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:57,118
MARISHA: Do I get any--

428
00:29:57,118 --> 00:30:00,358
MATT: Does your earth elemental have tremor sense?
Make a perception check.

429
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:04,699
SAM: Yes, yes, it's all happening.

430
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:06,680
MARISHA: 15 total.

431
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,357
MATT: 15?

432
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:14,555
MARISHA: No, 16. That makes a difference.

433
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:16,173
SAM: Do I make a stealth check or something?

434
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:20,325
MATT: No, because you went your full movement, so
yeah, no. She senses you.

435
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:24,479
SAM: Okay. Does she have pinpoint accuracy or just
know the general direction?

436
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,684
TRAVIS: She's made of earth.

437
00:30:25,684 --> 00:30:32,297
MATT: She has a pretty good idea. So you don't see
him and as you're looking around you sense the

438
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:39,595
ground (footsteps). Something's there. Something
just moved behind that other building.

439
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:50,440
MARISHA: Feels like about 45 pounds. Oh, sorry, 75
pounds. Four-foot five... That seems tall.

440
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,457
TRAVIS: I don't have the deck, by the way. No
deck.

441
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:55,869
TALIESIN: I would hope so.

442
00:30:55,869 --> 00:31:02,629
TRAVIS: Why? I mean, technically it's before the
Vecna fight but it didn't make the portal.

443
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:05,865
MATT: From a story, it's before because I needed a
reason for Vax to still be there, but I wanted to

444
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:11,296
make sure that everything was there. Yeah, tremor
sense, 60 feet. Yeah. All right, so that ends

445
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:12,369
Scanlan's turn.

446
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:13,444
SAM: She knows where I am?

447
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:22,219
MATT: You don't know that. You're like, "Aw, I'm
so slick! Nobody knows where I am!" She's like--

448
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:37,482
"There." All right, and finishing Scanlan's turn,
Grog. At this moment, the energy in those two

449
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:43,931
circles begin to (vibrating). Percival, you glance
over the back of your shoulder and you see a burst

450
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,968
of bluish-purple energy fill the entire chamber.

451
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,837
MARISHA: The inside circles?

452
00:31:52,837 --> 00:32:02,175
MATT: Inside this entire room fills purple. It
washes past you. You feel warm but no damage,

453
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,359
nothing.

454
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,509
TRAVIS: Nothing?

455
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:05,733
MARISHA: I don't trust that.

456
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:10,190
TALIESIN: Can I say, Woo, that was close! Do I
hear myself?

457
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,130
MATT: Yes.

458
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,592
TALIESIN: Damn it! Fuck!

459
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:16,847
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh no!

460
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:18,700
MATT: And that's all you saw.

461
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,315
TALIESIN: Well, that makes life a little more
complicated.

462
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,229
MATT: Grog, your turn.

463
00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:30,744
TRAVIS: All my spells. Can I open <i>le chest du
mysterie</i>?

464
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:36,347
MATT: You may. You use your action to open the
chest and reach inside. You get yourself a Potion

465
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:37,834
of Superior Healing.

466
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:46,153
TRAVIS: Yes, sweet. Great. I have my full
movement, right? Can I come out of the room and

467
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:48,277
start making my way toward this area?

468
00:32:48,277 --> 00:32:57,935
MATT: Sure. 50 is about right here.

469
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,596
TRAVIS: That sounds great. And this is a solid
column? There's no way in there?

470
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:05,764
MATT: It is solid, but there's no roof on it. It's
an open cylinder, almost like a small cylindrical

471
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:08,949
bunker. It's about six feet tall.

472
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:10,950
TRAVIS: Okay, so you could--

473
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,833
MATT: Yeah, you could use it for cover or use it
to hide. The other ones, though, with the towers

474
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:19,316
on top, are solid. Even though they have windows
there, imagine those have no entry. They're just a

475
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:25,185
platform for the towers generating electricity.
Does that end your turn, Grog? All right, that

476
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:27,267
brings us to Vax.

477
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:33,262
LIAM: Well, you didn't-- I asked a very specific
question and I need an answer. Yeah. Before I can

478
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,617
make a call.

479
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:37,247
MATT: All right. There are stairs that spiral up.

480
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:40,484
LIAM: Aw, great. Thanks.

481
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:43,263
SAM: I've never seen someone so disappointed at
stairs before.

482
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:45,391
MARISHA: We've got an idea of where he is.

483
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,270
LIAM: Yeah, that's why I threw the phone down.

484
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,792
MATT: I'm sorry. This works for a certain point
before I'm like, all right.

485
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:56,207
LIAM: I know, I know. That's my magic power. Some
people turn into monsters, some people hide.

486
00:33:56,207 --> 00:34:00,211
SAM: Your magic power is your wit.

487
00:34:00,211 --> 00:34:03,233
LIAM: All right, hold on. I'm doing my fucking
move!

488
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:08,475
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. If you die, do you come
back 30 minutes later, naked, out of the woods?

489
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:11,199
MATT: 24 hours, yeah. But he still loses the
Battle Royale.

490
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,142
MARISHA: I was going to say, does he win the
battle? Just waits?

491
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:19,572
TRAVIS: Walks out naked. Lord Colville is like, "I
am pleased."

492
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:28,927
LIAM: Coming at you. Okay, that's what I'm doing.

493
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:35,070
MATT: Okay, got you. All right, that ends Vax's
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

494
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:47,195
MARISHA: Oh, shit. I want to go, hm. Bink, bink.
Oh hey, Scanlan! (laser noise)

495
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:49,024
MATT: You're going to Sunbeam the gnome?

496
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:50,511
MARISHA: I'm going to Sunbeam the gnome.

497
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:52,976
MATT: Scanlan, as you're sitting there hiding--

498
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:54,473
SAM: She cannot see me.

499
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:59,519
MATT: This giant earth elemental comes around the
corner, that you know to be Keyleth, and looks in

500
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,847
the general space you are and fires a beam in the
direction where you are. And it's wide

501
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:09,037
enough to hit you. So you gather, in that brief
moment before you get completely enveloped by

502
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:15,089
burning, radiant energy, "Oh shit, she knows where
I am." Make a constitution saving throw, please.

503
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:16,517
SAM: Can I Counterspell that?

504
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:17,656
MATT: Yeah you can.

505
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:21,074
SAM: Okay, I will Counterspell that at level
four.

506
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:24,338
MARISHA: Wait, but I've already cast it. It's a
concentration spell.

507
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:25,899
MATT: That's true. No.

508
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:26,894
SAM: It just happens?

509
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:30,651
MATT: Yeah. You're right. Thank you for reminding
me of that. Yeah, make a constitution saving

510
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:31,818
throw.

511
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:37,789
SAM: Constitution saving throw! First blood. 22.

512
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:41,835
MARISHA: Fuck! Yeah, you save against it.

513
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:43,947
MATT: Okay, so you're not blinded.

514
00:35:43,947 --> 00:35:45,806
SAM: Great, that's good.

515
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:50,613
MATT: And you take half damage.

516
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:54,403
TALIESIN: But he becomes visible, right?

517
00:35:54,403 --> 00:36:00,705
MATT: No. Once we get the damage in, he has to
make a concentration check.

518
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:05,719
MARISHA: 27 plus five, so 32.

519
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:13,182
MATT: 32, so 16 points of radiant damage and I
need you to make a constitution saving throw, with

520
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:14,470
advantage because you're a war caster.

521
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,323
MARISHA: He already did. Oh no, wait. Oh,
concentration.

522
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:20,163
SAM: Another 22.

523
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:25,071
MATT: All right, you're fine. You maintain
concentration on Invisibility. All right.

524
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:27,935
MARISHA: And I'm going to use the rest of my
movement to go--

525
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:43,525
TALIESIN: I have lost two of my most powerful
weapons already in one round.

526
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:47,424
MARISHA: I'll go there.

527
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:55,372
TALIESIN: Damn. It's okay, but I've lost two of my
most powerful weapons already. Shit.

528
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:56,561
MARISHA: What did you lose?

529
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:58,767
TALIESIN: I lost my Spider Climbing and I lost my
Silence.

530
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:04,386
MARISHA: Oh, your Spider Climbing is gone too?
That sucks.

531
00:37:04,386 --> 00:37:07,860
SAM: But your most powerful weapon is your wit,
just like Liam!

532
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:16,353
LIAM: I'm just trying to live to intermission.
Come on.

533
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:24,544
MATT: So Keyleth, is that your turn? All right,
you moved around that way. Top of the round. Oh,

534
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:26,159
you do have a bonus action still, yeah.

535
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,042
MARISHA: No, I don't have anything to do. Never
mind.

536
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,623
MATT: Percival, you're up.

537
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:39,859
TALIESIN: Man, okay. I have 30 bits of movement.
I'm irritated. Can I make it to that door? No, I

538
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:56,604
can't make it to the door in one round, can I. I'm
going to-- shit, this is awkward. I've seen what

539
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:59,887
those things do already and I know they're about
to do it again.

540
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:08,790
TRAVIS: The first time it was after me and the
second time it was right before me.

541
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,621
SAM: Why is this so stressful?! We already beat
the bad guy!

542
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:16,721
MATT: But now you're beating the ultimate villain:
yourselves.

543
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:39,875
TALIESIN: There is nothing good I can do. I'm
going to start making my way over here and try and

544
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:43,956
make it to against, not quite to the door, but to
the wall.

545
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:47,110
MATT: 30. You get to about there with your
movement.

546
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,698
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to be one over.

547
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:50,512
MATT: Yeah, so one over this way?

548
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:53,827
TALIESIN: Because I know that thing's got a
radiant kick.

549
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:58,206
MATT: Okay. All right, that's your movement.

550
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:02,071
TALIESIN: And then for my action--

551
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:07,206
MATT: You do, as you turn the corner, glance over
and you see a large earth elemental around the

552
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:10,643
corner, stomping within visual range.

553
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:15,870
TRAVIS: If you also want to see something pretty,
you look behind you, girl. I'm sitting over here

554
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,102
flexing.

555
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:19,448
MATT: That's true, and you do see Grog across the
water that way.

556
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:25,514
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to spend the rest of my
movement, then-- oh fuck, there is no good thing.

557
00:39:25,514 --> 00:39:27,124
That door is locked, I'm sure it is.

558
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:28,966
MATT: Well that's 30 feet right there.

559
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:48,946
TALIESIN: Well I have an action still. Since I'm
here, I'm actually going to take a few potshots at

560
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:50,287
Keyleth for fun.

561
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,532
SAM: Yes you will! First blood!

562
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:55,631
MATT: So you have four attacks.

563
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:57,374
MARISHA: Are you going to say that every time
someone gets hit?

564
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:58,831
SAM: Yes.

565
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:00,235
MATT: Which weapon are you using?

566
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:14,829
TALIESIN: I'm using Bad News because the distance.
First shot is-- I'm actually going to do a deadeye

567
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:23,350
shot to gain advantage. Actually, that's not fun.
Yeah, deadeye to gain advantage. Here we go for

568
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:33,419
that. And that crits! So I'm going to use that
crit. I'm also going to drop all of Cabal's Ruin,

569
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:35,992
the entire run of Cabal's Ruin into that.

570
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:38,894
SAM: Oh, shit! All right, it's begun.

571
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,310
MARISHA: Might want to save your shit, but all
right.

572
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,508
TALIESIN: Cabal's Ruin is best used early. He
knows why.

573
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:51,363
LIAM: Sam, your face folded in the shirt is
terrifying. It's better flattened out, but with

574
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,508
four folds in it? Terrible.

575
00:40:53,508 --> 00:40:57,040
TRAVIS: I like that right nipple coming through.

576
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:05,474
TALIESIN: Actually, that's technically, those are
not d12s. These are d12s. I really should have

577
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:11,151
four of these, but I'll do two and remember to-- I
have to double all these dice, so here we go. Time

578
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:13,480
to be a real jerk.

579
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:21,535
MATT: Well, Taliesin, here's the weird thing.
Cabal's Ruin currently has no effect.

580
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:26,592
TRAVIS: Oh, you got fucking smoked by the purple
shit!

581
00:41:26,592 --> 00:41:28,266
TALIESIN: Would that have emptied it?

582
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:32,201
MATT: It currently lays against you like a normal
cloak.

583
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:35,199
SAM: You don't know. You don't know!

584
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,040
MATT: But you still get the shot off so you can
roll damage on that.

585
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,733
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

586
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:45,046
LIAM: Yeah, I don't know. I'm in this building
over here.

587
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:46,151
SAM: Oh, are you?

588
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:47,315
LIAM: Yes.

589
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:48,631
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.

590
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:56,259
TRAVIS: I need to keep living in those places. I
don't know what it does, though.

591
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:58,828
TALIESIN: That's 27 points of damage.

592
00:41:58,828 --> 00:42:03,616
MATT: Piercing damage? Which, non-magical, you're
resistant to.

593
00:42:03,616 --> 00:42:07,080
TALIESIN: Whole theory of that was to throw Cabal
into that.

594
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,600
MATT: So you would take 13 points of piercing
damage for the first hit.

595
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,190
TALIESIN: That is irritating.

596
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,049
MATT: You still have three more attacks.

597
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:18,452
TALIESIN: I'm going to use one of those attacks to
reload.

598
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,450
TRAVIS: How many points, Keyleth?

599
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,808
MARISHA: 13.

600
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:30,518
SAM: Ooh, first blood!

601
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:34,650
MATT: You watch (gunshot). You see bits and pieces
of the outer-shelled armor of the earth elemental

602
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,519
fracture and spiral off. Minimal impact.

603
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,678
TALIESIN: All right, and then I'm going to take
another shot and reload. This will be third and

604
00:42:41,678 --> 00:42:50,292
fourth attack, shot and reload. At Grog! Because
that was disappointing. And I'm going to do a

605
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:54,195
push-back because I'm curious to see what happens
when he-- I think that'll almost get him to hit

606
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:55,495
the edge.

607
00:42:55,495 --> 00:42:56,554
MATT: Okay.

608
00:42:56,554 --> 00:43:02,059
TALIESIN: So let's see what ten feet does to him.
Yeah. I'm just curious. You're near the edge,

609
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:09,770
sorry. Nothing personal. That's 28 to hit.

610
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,833
MATT: I'm pretty sure that hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

611
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:20,803
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not bad at all. You're fine.
That's 15 points of damage and you move ten feet

612
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:22,299
away from me.

613
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:28,146
MATT: Okay, so as you take half that because
you're raging, you get pushed five, ten into the

614
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:30,514
barrier. Make a constitution saving throw.

615
00:43:30,514 --> 00:43:39,404
TRAVIS: 30. 18 plus 12.

616
00:43:39,404 --> 00:43:47,298
MATT: Okay, so you succeed. So you take-- that was
a very balanced roll. Like, six, six, six! Two,

617
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:58,993
two, one. 23 points of force damage, halved. 23
would be halved, so 11, and you do not get pushed.

618
00:43:58,993 --> 00:44:08,249
As it slaps you into it, it slams into your back
and you feel it forcing you away from it at a much

619
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:13,771
harder rate than you were forced into it, but you
manage to hold firm on the ground and not get

620
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:15,071
pushed forward.

621
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:16,385
TRAVIS: Into the water?

622
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:17,526
SAM: Or whatever that substance is.

623
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:18,772
TRAVIS: Okay.

624
00:44:18,772 --> 00:44:26,118
MATT: All right. So that's your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

625
00:44:26,118 --> 00:44:34,048
SAM: I'm up? Okay, knowing where she is with my
tremor sense and just having seen her walk through

626
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:35,176
there--

627
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:36,827
MATT: You watched her walk around.

628
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:49,505
SAM: I'm going to peek around the corner and I'm
going to, even if it kills my Invisibility-- oh

629
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:52,507
wait! First I'm going to bonus action heal myself.
Healing Word.

630
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:57,237
MATT: Okay, this will break your Invisibility. So
level two?

631
00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:00,184
SAM: Level two, yeah. Why not.

632
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:07,203
MATT: I just assume at this point. So 2d4 plus
six.

633
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:17,187
SAM: Ooh, four and a four! Okay, that's 14. I'm
back up. For my action, I will start singing.

634
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:27,531
(singing) If you want my body and you think I'm
sexy, baby then start to dance! (normal) And I

635
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:34,620
will cast Irresistible Dance on her. Through the
Hand Cone, by the way.

636
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:47,166
MATT: So hearing Scanlan's song, Marisha, there is
no roll because it is irresistible. Your earth

637
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:54,061
elemental form begins tapping a heavy stone foot.
(impacts) You start turning into your own version

638
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:58,519
of STOMP, a one-elemental show. Slamming into the
ground to the beat, maintaining it although he

639
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:06,971
stopped singing, you're feeling it. Hold on, let
me see here. Let me check one thing.

640
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:12,327
SAM: I can't even find it in the book.

641
00:46:12,327 --> 00:46:14,298
MATT: Let me check one thing just to be sure
because she's an elemental and that may or may not

642
00:46:14,298 --> 00:46:16,323
have an impact on this.

643
00:46:16,323 --> 00:46:19,044
SAM: I can't find it in the book. Is it not in the
book?

644
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:22,982
TALIESIN: Irresistible Dance. It might be in the
new book.

645
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:35,451
MATT: All right, yes. So you are not immune to
charm, so you're fine. So you can't move.

646
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:40,766
SAM: Oh, she can <i>only</i> move.

647
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:49,849
MATT: That's true. So on your turn, you have to
use all your movement to dance without leaving

648
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:54,242
your space. So you're unable to move from that
spot until you get rid of the spell.

649
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:59,635
MARISHA: Can I do the Locomotion and do a
traveling dance?

650
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:03,945
MATT: You can, as long as it's in that space. So
you can do a little box-slide into that five-foot

651
00:47:03,945 --> 00:47:05,792
square and you're fine.

652
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,394
MARISHA: How long does this last?

653
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:10,454
MATT: It lasts until you spend an action to try
and make a saving throw to resist it.

654
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:13,187
MARISHA: I have to spend an action?

655
00:47:13,187 --> 00:47:15,597
MATT: Yeah. You also have disadvantage on
dexterity saving throws while this is happening.

656
00:47:15,597 --> 00:47:20,994
So you can't move. You still have your action and
you can still cast spells from it, but until you

657
00:47:20,994 --> 00:47:23,963
spend an action to try and make a saving throw--

658
00:47:23,963 --> 00:47:26,314
MARISHA: What kind of saving throw?

659
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:30,839
MATT: This would be a wisdom saving throw.

660
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:31,919
TRAVIS: What if someone hits her?

661
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:34,862
MATT: Doesn't matter. So Scanlan--

662
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:38,535
SAM: I'm going to use whatever movement I have to
hide again behind this little--

663
00:47:38,535 --> 00:47:44,547
MATT: Okay, that's about as far as you can get.
Okay, that ends your go? Top of the round. Grog,

664
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:51,421
you're up. The torches at the base of the tower
begin to flare up and then (explosion). You watch

665
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:59,661
as all the space around the outside of the tower
radiates with burning flame, affecting nobody. But

666
00:47:59,661 --> 00:48:05,873
you get the sense that there are elements to this
field you have to use to your advantage or avoid

667
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:07,246
altogether.

668
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:09,966
TRAVIS: Good to know. Fire death.

669
00:48:09,966 --> 00:48:14,029
MATT: Grog, as you see this flare burn around you
and then dissipate, it's your turn.

670
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:20,408
TRAVIS: Oh God, I was like, what? I'm sorry! Can I
use my action and dash to run all the way over to

671
00:48:20,408 --> 00:48:30,494
this spot, please? Great. And that will--

672
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:33,585
SAM: Where are you going? She's pinned down, dude!
We need you over here!

673
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:36,089
TRAVIS: That will complete my turn.

674
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:38,026
MATT: Vax, you're up.

675
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:40,382
LIAM: All right, here it comes. Boop!

676
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:45,626
MARISHA: Jesus. Such a fascinating game.

677
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:52,798
LIAM: You guys are fucking dicks. I chose rogue.
This is what I can do! That's it! I don't have any

678
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:57,164
other shit I can do! This is it. I am defensive!

679
00:48:57,164 --> 00:48:59,587
TRAVIS: You haven't even been touched yet.

680
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:03,455
TALIESIN: All of us have taken a little.

681
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:12,809
LIAM: Raven Queen take me. Okay.

682
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:14,846
MATT: So that's what you see.

683
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:16,893
MARISHA: Give it time, dude.

684
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:18,239
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

685
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,521
LIAM: Good, good. Am I out of stuff?

686
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:25,781
MATT: No, you still have your action.

687
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:29,370
LIAM: Okay, this is real quick. I just have one
last note.

688
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:40,694
MATT: Okay. Got it. All right. Keyleth, you're
up.

689
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:44,211
MARISHA: Okay, I don't see anyone.

690
00:49:44,211 --> 00:49:47,896
MATT: Nope. Scanlan is making you dance and then
goes like, do-do-do! And disappears behind the

691
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:49,105
pillars.

692
00:49:49,105 --> 00:49:52,397
MARISHA: In my, what is it called?

693
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:54,345
MATT: Irresistible Dance.

694
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:57,009
SAM: Otto's Irresistible Dance.

695
00:49:57,009 --> 00:50:04,098
MARISHA: In my Terran language I say, You fucking
asshole! And as I'm dancing I'm going to try and

696
00:50:04,098 --> 00:50:06,662
make my wisdom saving throw because I can't do
anything else.

697
00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:07,966
MATT: Go for it.

698
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:19,326
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil! You totally fucked
me! No, wait! No, you kind of fucked me. What's

699
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:21,930
seven plus 14? 21.

700
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,448
MATT: The DC is?

701
00:50:24,448 --> 00:50:26,646
SAM: 22.

702
00:50:26,646 --> 00:50:28,704
MATT: 22, you do not succeed.

703
00:50:28,704 --> 00:50:33,377
TRAVIS: You got high wisdom, yo!

704
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:36,741
MATT: You're just grooving out!

705
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:39,605
LIAM: Just stand there and hang out until three
hours of this game are up.

706
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:45,583
MARISHA: Question. Because it's cast on my
elemental form, if I switch wild shapes, will it

707
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:46,864
go away?

708
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:49,485
MATT: Only one way to find out.

709
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:57,767
MARISHA: Okay. I'll use my bonus action to turn
into a fire elemental.

710
00:50:57,767 --> 00:51:15,418
MATT: As your form shifts into that of a moving,
grooving fire elemental, you continue dancing in

711
00:51:15,418 --> 00:51:19,417
place. But now it's less STOMP and more really
smooth, soft rave dancing.

712
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:25,076
LIAM: It's like at Burning Man.

713
00:51:25,076 --> 00:51:32,914
MATT: Essentially. That ends Keyleth's turn.
Percy, you're up. Percival, the cloak: the energy

714
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:36,518
returns to it. You feel the boots solidify back in
place and no sound.

715
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:41,502
TALIESIN: That will do. I'm going to run around to
the door.

716
00:51:41,502 --> 00:51:45,885
MARISHA: It only knocks it out for a round? Or for
when it's turned on?

717
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:48,220
MATT: All magical items, all effects, it seems.

718
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,650
TALIESIN: I'm going to snap.

719
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,390
MATT: No sound.

720
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,700
TALIESIN: All right. Is the door open or is the
door not open?

721
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,773
MATT: The door's closed.

722
00:51:55,773 --> 00:51:58,266
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Animus to open the
lock.

723
00:51:58,266 --> 00:52:00,053
MATT: Okay. Make an attack with it.

724
00:52:00,053 --> 00:52:08,711
TALIESIN: Don't fuck me, that's 29 to hit.

725
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:10,379
MATT: Yeah, no, roll damage.

726
00:52:10,379 --> 00:52:18,115
TALIESIN: I assume the door cannot take psychic
damage.

727
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:21,020
MATT: The door doesn't take psychic damage.

728
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,712
TRAVIS: Are you sure? You've got a big vendetta
against doors.

729
00:52:23,712 --> 00:52:25,645
TALIESIN: 17 damage to the lock.

730
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:32,534
MATT: You fire, no sound. The door opens with a
creak, no sound. The chamber within reveals a

731
00:52:32,534 --> 00:52:36,556
chest in the corner.

732
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:46,901
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in, shut the door. It's
going to be an action to open that chest, isn't

733
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:50,337
it? Okay. I'm going to hide behind the door, so if
it opens.

734
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:54,514
MATT: You hide off to this side, waiting.

735
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:56,873
TALIESIN: I'm just being careful.

736
00:52:56,873 --> 00:53:11,217
MARISHA: I have a question. Would Freedom of
Movement negate the dance spell? It says, "For the

737
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:14,429
"duration, the target is unaffected by difficult
terrain and spells and other magical effects can

738
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:19,487
"neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the
target to be paralyzed or restrained."

739
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:27,994
MATT: Technically, it's not reducing your
movement. You're just spending your turn dancing

740
00:53:27,994 --> 00:53:29,106
in place.

741
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:30,633
MARISHA: Damn it!

742
00:53:30,633 --> 00:53:31,771
TRAVIS: That's amazing!

743
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:37,047
MARISHA: I love this DJ!

744
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:42,935
MATT: This spell is worded apparently to just
skirt around Freedom of Movement. You <i>can</i> move,

745
00:53:42,935 --> 00:53:46,938
you just don't want to. You're Flashdancing in
there!

746
00:53:46,938 --> 00:53:50,139
LIAM: Best fiery running man ever!

747
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:54,024
MATT: That ends Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

748
00:53:54,024 --> 00:54:04,804
SAM: I become an ancient brass dragon. True
Polymorph is not a concentration spell, right? It

749
00:54:04,804 --> 00:54:06,317
just happens.

750
00:54:06,317 --> 00:54:10,020
MATT: True Polymorph is concentration.

751
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,303
SAM: So she would stop dancing?

752
00:54:12,303 --> 00:54:13,600
MATT: Correct.

753
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,701
SAM: Then I'm not going to do that. Shit.

754
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:18,801
MARISHA: You know what? I'll take that!

755
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:22,574
TALIESIN: I'm not going to be a brass dragon! I'm
going to be me.

756
00:54:22,574 --> 00:54:24,522
MARISHA: Enjoy the show, Scanlan!

757
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:27,580
SAM: Sorry, Matt, sorry.

758
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,411
MATT: That's okay. The brass dragon figure goes
back on the table.

759
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:34,736
SAM: You have an ancient brass dragon at the
ready?!

760
00:54:34,736 --> 00:54:36,622
TRAVIS: Of <i>course</i> he does!

761
00:54:36,622 --> 00:54:40,878
TALIESIN: Have you seen his office? It's basically
brass dragons.

762
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:44,749
MARISHA: Technically my office, so it's an even
stronger statement.

763
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:50,499
MATT: Sorry. It's getting better! No, it's not.

764
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:57,201
SAM: Well, in that case, I will-- poo.

765
00:54:57,201 --> 00:55:00,450
MATT: Do you shake it out of your pant leg?

766
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,366
LIAM: Rabbit pellets.

767
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:13,362
SAM: I want to roast her! She's pinned down, man!
We got her right now, guys, this is it!

768
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:15,186
TALIESIN: We can't hear you.

769
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:18,793
MATT: You do all have the earrings in!

770
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:20,529
TALIESIN: But I certainly can't hear him.

771
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:22,467
TRAVIS: Oh, we do have the earrings in?

772
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:24,707
MATT: Yeah, you've got everything you have.

773
00:55:24,707 --> 00:55:26,253
TRAVIS: Oh we can talk shit while we play?!

774
00:55:26,253 --> 00:55:27,480
MATT: Yeah, you can!

775
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,801
TALIESIN: I can't hear anything you say.

776
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:30,939
TRAVIS: I'm going to teabag you when you're dead.

777
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:38,313
MATT: Scanlan, what you got? Grog, you're on
deck.

778
00:55:38,456 --> 00:55:44,433
SAM: I will say, though the earrings, She's open,
let's kill her. Trust me, I won't kill you if you

779
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:47,137
get close.

780
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:52,597
LIAM: "That's the thing, though, guys, I'm a
really good liar."

781
00:55:52,597 --> 00:55:58,120
SAM: I'll lean out and Lightning Bolt her.

782
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,332
MATT: Go for it.

783
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:02,072
LIAM: Is this out of the dick?

784
00:56:02,072 --> 00:56:10,875
SAM: Of course. No, I'm sensitive to the plight of
women. I will do it in a gentle bow.

785
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:16,673
MARISHA: You just m'lady lightning struck me?

786
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,348
LIAM: Tip of the hat.

787
00:56:18,348 --> 00:56:27,249
MATT: M'lightning bolt. It is the m'lightning
bolt.

788
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:31,721
(laughter)

789
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:39,357
MATT: And thus, a class begins to percolate in my
head. Scanlan, 8d6.

790
00:56:39,357 --> 00:56:42,110
LIAM: We peaked at the 35 minute mark.

791
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,716
MATT: The Bardic School of White Knighting.

792
00:56:44,716 --> 00:56:58,038
LIAM: The m'lightning bolt. Artists, I've never
asked for anything specific. But now.

793
00:56:58,038 --> 00:56:59,369
SAM: 26.

794
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:02,028
MATT: I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw
with disadvantage because you're dancing.

795
00:57:02,028 --> 00:57:13,004
MARISHA: This is so great. No, that was a natural
one. So I take it. How much was it?

796
00:57:13,004 --> 00:57:16,852
MATT: 26 points of lightning damage to your fiery
form.

797
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:25,318
SAM: Do elementals maintain their damage level? If
she goes back to stone, does it halve the damage

798
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:26,690
that it had?

799
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,907
MATT: No.

800
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:29,257
SAM: Damn!

801
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:33,902
LIAM: Get it out of your head that you're going to
win. Just have fun on the ride.

802
00:57:33,902 --> 00:57:37,771
SAM: If we're all over here, we can do it!

803
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:42,454
TALIESIN: It's like a rollercoaster where you know
that they haven't finished the last ten feet of

804
00:57:42,454 --> 00:57:43,541
track.

805
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:46,025
TRAVIS: He's just going to come out from wherever
he is and help you right now.

806
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:48,002
SAM: She's there, man!

807
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:51,429
LIAM: You all are going to die, and I'm going to
come out and embrace my girlfriend and let her

808
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:53,786
kill me. That's how this game is going to go.

809
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:55,301
MARISHA: You would do that for me?

810
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:57,450
LIAM: Let her think that.

811
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,317
(laughter)

812
00:57:59,317 --> 00:58:01,109
MARISHA: That's true love, right there.

813
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:02,493
SAM: I'm going to turn back behind there.

814
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:11,077
MATT: You're just boop! Okay, that ends your turn.
Top of the round. Grog, as you are coming around

815
00:58:11,077 --> 00:58:18,494
the way, you see a familiar sparking of lightning
energy as the two lightning towers blast off a

816
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:25,743
radius of lightning energy. But no one's in the
radius to be affected by it. That brings it to

817
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:26,974
your turn.

818
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:29,603
TRAVIS: I would like to smash the door with my
bloodaxe.

819
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:31,097
MATT: Make an attack.

820
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:34,115
TRAVIS: Yeah, either one of those.

821
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:41,933
SAM: In the distance, do we hear another door
breaking?

822
00:58:41,933 --> 00:58:43,559
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

823
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:46,723
MATT: You do. Another heavy hit right after the
bolt of lighting dissipates over the horizon, you

824
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:52,622
see splintered woods as an axe swings over the
range of the nearby roof of that building. You

825
00:58:52,622 --> 00:58:58,903
hear an angry goliath yell as the door is
sundered, opening to the chamber within.

826
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:07,002
TRAVIS: May I entrez-vous, please? I will end my
turn.

827
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:09,661
MATT: All right. Vax.

828
00:59:09,661 --> 00:59:16,031
LIAM: Coming at you. It's so good. I'm going to
win on this move. Okay.

829
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:19,341
TRAVIS: I'm going to mime it.

830
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:26,951
SAM: I'm single-handedly first blood-ing over
here! I'm first blood-ing everybody!

831
00:59:26,951 --> 00:59:30,904
MATT: Scanlan is playing the exact opposite as he
did as Taryon in the last one!

832
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:32,595
SAM: Yep!

833
00:59:32,595 --> 00:59:38,580
MARISHA: Switching masks.

834
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,312
TRAVIS: Are you writing a paragraph?

835
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:41,746
LIAM: A short one.

836
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:45,187
SAM: Dear Matt, check this box if you like me.

837
00:59:45,187 --> 00:59:48,303
MATT: Okay, so that ends your turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

838
00:59:48,303 --> 00:59:55,161
MARISHA: Give me this shit! I want to save from
it! Natural 20!

839
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:58,414
MATT: And with that, you have your movement back.

840
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:01,075
SAM: Oh no.

841
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:03,512
MARISHA: (grunting)

842
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:06,255
TALIESIN: You still have movement and a bonus
action.

843
01:00:06,255 --> 01:00:07,855
MATT: Yep.

844
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:10,777
MARISHA: Bink! Do I see Scanlan?

845
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:12,345
MATT: You do.

846
01:00:12,345 --> 01:00:13,651
MARISHA: (laser noise)

847
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,938
LIAM: Did you just make that noise?

848
01:00:16,938 --> 01:00:18,083
SAM: Yeah, what's that noise?

849
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:19,951
MARISHA: Sorry. Sunbeam!

850
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:24,527
MATT: No, you don't have another action because
you used your action to resist the spell.

851
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:28,192
MARISHA: Oh! I have a bonus though. I will use my
bonus to go back to earth elemental.

852
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:35,576
MATT: Which, previously, Keyleth had two elemental
forms before she had to make a short rest.

853
01:00:35,576 --> 01:00:39,101
20th-level Keyleth has just transformed into her
third form.

854
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:42,567
LIAM: Zero fucks.

855
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:46,019
TRAVIS: Does that mean she can go earth elemental
again, or is that it?

856
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:53,919
MATT: At full health. You get the sense now, and
you've heard of such rumors in your research as a

857
01:00:53,919 --> 01:01:00,357
bard, that certain powerful archdruids can wild
shape as many times as they want.

858
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:08,258
MARISHA: This is open, right? Can I do a big old
jump into it? I do that.

859
01:01:08,258 --> 01:01:10,320
LIAM: Sphere of Annihilation!

860
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,185
MATT: All right, that's your turn.

861
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:17,903
MARISHA: Don't fuck with me like that! I took you
seriously for a good two seconds!

862
01:01:17,903 --> 01:01:20,231
TRAVIS: One little marble you didn't see.

863
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:22,548
LIAM: That's the biggest disappointment you have
tonight. You did all right.

864
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,538
SAM: Are there doors on that thing?

865
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:30,402
MATT: Percy, you're up. No, it's a solid wall
about six feet tall, which you can see Keyleth

866
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:32,113
peeking over the top a little bit.

867
01:01:32,113 --> 01:01:33,851
TALIESIN: So I'm going to open that chest.

868
01:01:33,851 --> 01:01:37,211
MATT: All right, you open the chest and you
acquire a potion of superior healing.

869
01:01:37,211 --> 01:01:43,698
TALIESIN: Thank you. And that's how many feet?
That's like five. So I can now, I have a little

870
01:01:43,698 --> 01:01:51,724
bit of movement to leave. Ten, 15, 20. So I can at
least use 20 to get to that corner there. Yeah,

871
01:01:51,724 --> 01:01:58,839
toward me. There, just there. Do I see Scanlan or
is he still invisible?

872
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:00,882
MATT: No, he's not invisible anymore. You see
him.

873
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:06,178
TALIESIN: Oh, so I see him right there? I still
have ten feet of movement after that. Cool. I am

874
01:02:06,178 --> 01:02:07,689
going to shoot Scanlan.

875
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,236
SAM: Nice.

876
01:02:09,236 --> 01:02:22,798
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot Scanlan. Let's use
Bad News for-- actually, let's use, oh this'll be

877
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:32,050
fun. Let's do Animus, sharpshooter, and deadeye,
just for fun. Animus, sharpshooter, deadeye.

878
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,824
SAM: I will Cutting Words this first shot.

879
01:02:34,824 --> 01:02:36,105
MATT: Okay.

880
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:37,977
TALIESIN: I can't hear him.

881
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:43,471
MATT: Well, and you're further than 60 feet from
him, I think, actually. Yeah, so it wouldn't

882
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:44,763
work.

883
01:02:44,763 --> 01:02:56,766
TALIESIN: Animus, sharpshooter, dead shot. Oh,
you're so lucky that didn't crit. 28 to hit.

884
01:02:56,766 --> 01:02:58,772
MATT: 28 to hit.

885
01:02:58,772 --> 01:03:13,581
TALIESIN: That's 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic, plus I'm
going to-- eh, not on this one. This is shot

886
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:21,664
number one. So that's, oh, that's terrible. I'm
glad I did not. That's nine points of damage plus

887
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,162
one point of psychic, so that's ten points of
damage.

888
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:25,956
SAM: Are you adding these up? Because I'm not.

889
01:03:25,956 --> 01:03:27,566
MATT: You take ten points of damage.

890
01:03:27,566 --> 01:03:29,621
TALIESIN: For your next shot--

891
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:32,933
MATT: You don't hear anything. All of a sudden--

892
01:03:32,933 --> 01:03:36,640
TALIESIN: You take 20 points of damage because
that was sharpshooter. 20, excuse me.

893
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,439
MATT: So you take 20 points of damage and the
(impact and grunting). And you glance over your

894
01:03:40,439 --> 01:03:45,324
shoulder and you can see across the way, there's
Percival, gun up, but you've heard no gunfire.

895
01:03:45,324 --> 01:03:53,569
TALIESIN: Next shot. Same thing. Also didn't crit.
You're very lucky. That also hits. That's 29 to

896
01:03:53,569 --> 01:04:05,850
hit and then the same thing, 1d10 plus 1d6 plus
18. 26 points of damage.

897
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,592
MATT: 26 points of damage.

898
01:04:07,592 --> 01:04:15,211
TALIESIN: And I'll do the same thing one more
time.

899
01:04:15,211 --> 01:04:19,779
SAM: I'm the wrong target!

900
01:04:19,779 --> 01:04:24,808
TALIESIN: Natural 20! You've just been critted.
And I'm going to drop all of Cabal's Ruin into

901
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:47,043
this as well. So that's (counting) 40 points of
damage and now the 10d6 lightning damage. Does

902
01:04:47,043 --> 01:04:48,638
that get doubled or does that stay normal?

903
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:50,224
MATT: Lightning damage also gets doubled.

904
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:55,271
MARISHA: Oh, those were good rolls, too!

905
01:04:55,271 --> 01:05:03,792
TALIESIN: Plus 33 lightning damage on top of
that.

906
01:05:03,792 --> 01:05:07,036
MATT: 33 is doubled, so 66 points.

907
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,629
TALIESIN: 66 lightning damage on top of that.

908
01:05:08,629 --> 01:05:12,381
SAM: On top of what? I'm not adding your shit.

909
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:14,088
TALIESIN: 41 plus 66.

910
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:16,288
SAM: How is it 41? It was 40 before.

911
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,131
TALIESIN: Was it 40? 40 plus 66.

912
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:20,344
MATT: So 106 points of damage from that shot.

913
01:05:20,344 --> 01:05:28,389
TALIESIN: 106 points of damage on that shot. Oh, I
get my grit back on that, so that's nice. Ten.

914
01:05:28,389 --> 01:05:32,933
Cabal's empty. And for my final shot, (evil
laughter).

915
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:39,379
TRAVIS: You know we kind of need Scanlan to take
down Keyleth, right?

916
01:05:39,379 --> 01:05:41,622
SAM: It's all good. This is how he wants to play
it.

917
01:05:41,622 --> 01:05:45,039
MARISHA: Come on, believe in yourself, man.

918
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,223
SAM: Taliesin's been trying to do this for
months.

919
01:05:48,223 --> 01:05:51,736
TRAVIS: Don't make Taliesin get up at 5:30
anymore. It's not good for anyone.

920
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:55,220
LIAM: This might push you toward chaotic good.

921
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,677
TALIESIN: For my final shot, I'm going to reload
and hide.

922
01:05:58,677 --> 01:06:02,078
MATT: Okay. You reload.

923
01:06:02,078 --> 01:06:04,703
LIAM: Full action to hide?

924
01:06:04,703 --> 01:06:09,102
MATT: Well, he's not actually using a hide action.
He just goes into a chamber.

925
01:06:09,102 --> 01:06:14,988
TALIESIN: It's going to take him so long to get to
me. And if I get within ten feet of him, there's

926
01:06:14,988 --> 01:06:16,854
nothing he can do.

927
01:06:16,854 --> 01:06:24,074
MATT: So Percival, that's the end of your turn?
Scanlan, you're up. You watched this earth

928
01:06:24,074 --> 01:06:31,369
elemental dive into the tower right next to you in
this open space. You get shot the fuck up. You're

929
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:37,765
covered in your own blood and you watch Percival
in the distance slink out of sight. And you're

930
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:39,826
hurting bad.

931
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:48,774
SAM: Yeah, I am. Mm, don't have lots of good
options. Oh boy.

932
01:06:48,774 --> 01:06:51,408
TALIESIN: I beat him up for you.

933
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,040
MARISHA: You did. Very much so.

934
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,014
TALIESIN: So you're either going to kill him next
round or he's going to do it to you.

935
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:06,463
SAM: Bonus action, 2nd-level Healing Word. Uh-huh,
got to get back in the game.

936
01:07:06,463 --> 01:07:08,663
TALIESIN: Roll that d4.

937
01:07:08,663 --> 01:07:11,623
SAM: Five plus six, 11 points. Yeah.

938
01:07:11,623 --> 01:07:17,140
MATT: There you go. Heal up 11 points of damage.
Hey, it all adds up.

939
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,804
TALIESIN: I'll make it go away again.

940
01:07:19,804 --> 01:07:22,219
SAM: Let's see here. What to do?

941
01:07:22,219 --> 01:07:24,806
TALIESIN: That was so pleasing.

942
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:29,126
TRAVIS: 106 points!

943
01:07:29,126 --> 01:07:30,711
TALIESIN: One shot! I did <i>three</i> shots.

944
01:07:30,711 --> 01:07:37,958
MATT: I'll keep this on deck just in case. Ancient
brass dragon. Just chilling on the side. You're on

945
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:44,889
deck, Grog.

946
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:50,175
TRAVIS: I'm texting you my turn.

947
01:07:50,175 --> 01:07:54,121
MARISHA: Who's on deck? You are?

948
01:07:54,121 --> 01:08:05,387
SAM: I need some healing. So. Shit. I've got to
get away from Keyleth. I've got to get healed.

949
01:08:05,387 --> 01:08:09,019
MARISHA: No, stay. Hang out.

950
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:13,358
SAM: I will Dimension Door to the opposite
circular tower.

951
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:16,045
MATT: The opposite circular tower?

952
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:17,794
SAM: Yes, behind it.

953
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:27,029
MATT: All righty. Hand me the piece? All righty.
That's your action.

954
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:30,098
SAM: That's my action. That's it.

955
01:08:30,098 --> 01:08:41,529
MATT: Grog. At the top of your turn, actually,
nothing happens because none of you-- all of you

956
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:44,608
are not able to see anything happen. Grog, it's
your turn.

957
01:08:44,608 --> 01:08:46,669
TRAVIS: I would like to open the chest.

958
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:50,715
MATT: You pull it open. Potion of Superior
Healing.

959
01:08:50,715 --> 01:08:52,287
TRAVIS: Hey, look at that.

960
01:08:52,287 --> 01:08:54,375
MATT: I also want you to make a constitution
saving throw.

961
01:08:54,375 --> 01:09:00,069
TRAVIS: 19.

962
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:16,137
MATT: 19? Wasn't a great roll. You take 20 points
of poison damage. Halved, because of your belt.

963
01:09:16,137 --> 01:09:19,622
TRAVIS: Oh, I do have resistance because of the
belt! Yes, thank you. So ten.

964
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,485
MATT: And you are currently poisoned.

965
01:09:22,485 --> 01:09:27,041
TRAVIS: Damn, son! From what, homie?

966
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:34,246
MATT: As you open the chest, this dark
black-purple smoke billows out as you grab and

967
01:09:34,246 --> 01:09:40,374
pull the potion out of it. Almost like a trigger
or something. It fills your nose, your lungs.

968
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:46,150
You're coughing and it seizes the inside of your
chest. And so you are currently poisoned.

969
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:54,339
TRAVIS: Cool. Can I use my movement to run out and
toward this hallway? See how far I get.

970
01:09:54,339 --> 01:10:03,200
MATT: You can get right inside, if you want.

971
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,253
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll stay just outside of it.

972
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:09,254
MATT: Okay, you're hanging right there, just on
the outskirts.

973
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:11,888
SAM: Do I see him?

974
01:10:11,888 --> 01:10:15,864
TRAVIS: Yeah, I see you! Hey, Scanlan.

975
01:10:15,864 --> 01:10:17,898
SAM: Does he see me?

976
01:10:17,898 --> 01:10:22,113
MATT: No, because you were hiding behind the side
and he rushed right to the hallway.

977
01:10:22,113 --> 01:10:24,458
TRAVIS: He's right behind me.

978
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:32,541
MATT: I'll say because you weren't hiding and as
part of the battlefield here, glancing about, he

979
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:34,533
does see you because you do not have a hide
action.

980
01:10:34,533 --> 01:10:35,693
SAM: Okay.

981
01:10:35,693 --> 01:10:37,647
TRAVIS: To be clear, I see you, and then I turn my
back on you.

982
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:39,414
SAM: Like a matador?

983
01:10:39,414 --> 01:10:41,947
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not focused on you right now.

984
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,813
TALIESIN: He's not mad at a door.

985
01:10:43,813 --> 01:10:46,096
TRAVIS: I mean I can look at you if you want me
to.

986
01:10:46,096 --> 01:10:48,254
MATT: Ends Grog's turn.

987
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:52,296
LIAM: It's already sent.

988
01:10:52,296 --> 01:10:53,400
TALIESIN: That's awful.

989
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,185
MARISHA: That's pretty bad, man. That's real bad.

990
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:57,272
TALIESIN: I don't feel like a good person
anymore.

991
01:10:57,272 --> 01:11:05,523
LIAM: Does that make sense?

992
01:11:05,523 --> 01:11:08,650
SAM: Pawn to rook four.

993
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:11,189
TALIESIN: What? Yahtzee?

994
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:15,483
SAM: Woodchuck to gray squirrel, woodchuck to gray
squirrel.

995
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:21,222
MATT: All right, I see what you're doing. That's
your turn. Keyleth.

996
01:11:21,222 --> 01:11:24,260
MARISHA: Do I feel anything around me?

997
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,675
MATT: Currently? What's the tremor sense?

998
01:11:28,675 --> 01:11:30,002
MARISHA: 60 feet.

999
01:11:30,002 --> 01:11:33,340
MATT: 60 feet? No movement. At all.

1000
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,820
TALIESIN: Even the tower? 60 feet?

1001
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,767
MATT: Yeah.

1002
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,645
TALIESIN: All right.

1003
01:11:38,645 --> 01:11:42,606
MARISHA: Okay.

1004
01:11:42,606 --> 01:11:48,426
SAM: Five master D&amp;D players!

1005
01:11:48,426 --> 01:11:52,417
MARISHA: And no one's been in here, right? You
tried to go in there and then failed?

1006
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:58,229
SAM: I tried the doorknob. I didn't really give it
all the effort.

1007
01:11:58,229 --> 01:12:04,241
MARISHA: I'm going to go (roars) and then use my
siege abilities to just beat down the wall.

1008
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:16,074
MARISHA: First one is 20 total. No, I'm sorry, 22
total.

1009
01:12:16,074 --> 01:12:20,926
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll damage and then double
it. Percy, you're on deck.

1010
01:12:20,926 --> 01:12:27,447
MARISHA: Five plus seven is 12, 24 plus five.

1011
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:31,172
MATT: Yeah, you just punch the door in and your
fist goes through it and you have to pull it off

1012
01:12:31,172 --> 01:12:38,687
the hinges and shake it off of your giant
battering ram-like fist. The door opens, reveals a

1013
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,557
singular chest against the other wall.

1014
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,369
MARISHA: Okay, I'll go ahead and open that.

1015
01:12:42,369 --> 01:12:45,560
MATT: Well, it's an action to open it, but you can
move up. What's your movement as an earth

1016
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,035
elemental?

1017
01:12:47,035 --> 01:12:48,793
MARISHA: 30 feet walking.

1018
01:12:48,793 --> 01:12:51,704
MATT: 30 feet? Yeah, you'd be able to just get up
to the chest but you don't have another action to

1019
01:12:51,704 --> 01:12:52,913
open it.

1020
01:12:52,913 --> 01:12:54,721
MARISHA: Okay. This is like a building, right?

1021
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:58,564
MATT: Yeah, you're having to duck down to get in
there. It's about ten feet tall and you're like

1022
01:12:58,564 --> 01:13:03,999
eleven-foot tall as an earth elemental, probably
littler than 12, so you're crouched down a little

1023
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,240
bit.

1024
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,321
MARISHA: Okay, I'm in there then.

1025
01:13:06,321 --> 01:13:08,194
MATT: That ends your turn, Percival, you're up.

1026
01:13:08,194 --> 01:13:25,280
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take this opportunity
to head out of the room and I want to climb up on

1027
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:38,256
top of this building. Then right up to this corner
right here. Actually, this corner right there.

1028
01:13:38,256 --> 01:13:41,547
MATT: Yeah, that's the end of your movement,
you'll be able to get there.

1029
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:42,869
TALIESIN: Can I see Grog?

1030
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:47,578
MATT: Currently no, you can not.

1031
01:13:47,578 --> 01:13:49,047
TALIESIN: I can't see anybody.

1032
01:13:49,047 --> 01:13:54,789
MATT: Nope. You have no sight on anybody. You get
to the top, aim, and the battlefield's quiet and

1033
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:56,551
empty and you're like, "Ah, fuck."

1034
01:13:56,551 --> 01:13:58,316
SAM: You can't see Keyleth popping out of the--

1035
01:13:58,316 --> 01:14:05,346
TALIESIN: No, she's inside. I'm going to go to the
center of it and if I could use my action to lay

1036
01:14:05,346 --> 01:14:09,005
down and hide if that's possible?

1037
01:14:09,005 --> 01:14:11,195
MATT: Well, your movement's there so you can't
move any further.

1038
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:18,299
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to lay down and, since
I'm on the roof, pull down to the roof and see if

1039
01:14:18,299 --> 01:14:19,786
I can get cover.

1040
01:14:19,786 --> 01:14:22,308
MATT: Okay. Are you trying to hide, or are you
just trying to give yourself cover?

1041
01:14:22,308 --> 01:14:24,108
TALIESIN: Cover.

1042
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:25,603
MATT: So you're going prone.

1043
01:14:25,603 --> 01:14:29,934
TALIESIN: I'm going prone and I want to keep an
eye on that front door.

1044
01:14:29,934 --> 01:14:32,282
LIAM: It's movement to go up, is it movement to go
down?

1045
01:14:32,282 --> 01:14:33,778
MATT: Yeah.

1046
01:14:33,778 --> 01:14:36,836
LIAM: Got any left? Got any movement left? To go
prone?

1047
01:14:36,836 --> 01:14:42,542
MATT: Well, no, to drop prone is fine. To get up
out of prone is just dropping to the ground.

1048
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:47,583
MARISHA: Is he close enough to where I feel a body
go (thud)?

1049
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:53,513
TALIESIN: I'm also completely silenced. Ten feet
all around me are completely silenced.

1050
01:14:53,513 --> 01:14:58,449
MATT: I know. Silence is different than vibration.
Unfortunately. I mean, it is vibration in the air,

1051
01:14:58,449 --> 01:15:07,041
but that's not going to stop vibration in the
ground. It just dampens the sound. Nope. He's just

1052
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:08,621
outside of it, so you feel nothing.

1053
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:10,068
MARISHA: Damn it!

1054
01:15:10,068 --> 01:15:13,379
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep an eye on that tower,
and if I see any movement I'm going to unload an

1055
01:15:13,379 --> 01:15:16,652
action on anything I see.

1056
01:15:16,652 --> 01:15:21,295
MATT: Got it. Make a general perception check for
me, if you don't mind.

1057
01:15:21,295 --> 01:15:28,539
TALIESIN: I'm going to use one of my resolve.
That's a save.

1058
01:15:28,539 --> 01:15:30,332
MATT: Saving throw, yeah, sorry.

1059
01:15:30,332 --> 01:15:33,548
TALIESIN: Okay, perception. That's a 14.

1060
01:15:33,548 --> 01:15:37,466
MATT: Ending Percy's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

1061
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:41,167
SAM: I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself, at
level one.

1062
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:42,387
MATT: Okay.

1063
01:15:42,387 --> 01:15:44,052
LIAM: That is the coward's way.

1064
01:15:44,052 --> 01:15:48,256
SAM: It's three plus six, right?

1065
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:49,771
MATT: Yes.

1066
01:15:49,771 --> 01:16:02,013
SAM: Great, awesome, nine more points, guys! I can
see Grog. I could take a pot shot at him, but that

1067
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:05,762
would just kick the hornet's nest a bit.

1068
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:07,258
MATT: You think?

1069
01:16:07,258 --> 01:16:12,683
SAM: I could score eight points of damage on him
and then die.

1070
01:16:12,683 --> 01:16:16,676
MATT: Yeah. You'd die.

1071
01:16:16,676 --> 01:16:30,452
SAM: I need to just heal. In that case, I will
dominate Grog.

1072
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:35,654
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1073
01:16:35,654 --> 01:16:45,144
SAM: Oh wait, shit, no, I can't do that. Is he
worked up, is he raging, can I tell?

1074
01:16:45,144 --> 01:16:48,079
MATT: Oh, yeah, he's going (huffing).

1075
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:49,201
SAM: Okay, forget that then.

1076
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:52,004
MATT: Yeah, you've worked with him enough to know
that while he's raging charm effects--

1077
01:16:52,004 --> 01:16:53,667
SAM: Forget it.

1078
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:56,873
MATT: Sorry. I'm giving you guys benefit of the
doubt that you've all worked together enough to

1079
01:16:56,873 --> 01:17:01,498
the point where you do notice elements of
techniques and tells. Because it's helped you in

1080
01:17:01,498 --> 01:17:02,887
the past.

1081
01:17:02,887 --> 01:17:06,080
SAM: I could put on my hat of disguise.

1082
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,032
(laughter)

1083
01:17:09,032 --> 01:17:11,953
MARISHA: What did Matt just say! We all know you
have that!

1084
01:17:11,953 --> 01:17:15,327
SAM: No, just so that you guys would think I'm a
kindly old man who just walked onto the

1085
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:16,660
battlefield.

1086
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,762
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's see how well that goes.

1087
01:17:18,762 --> 01:17:21,707
LIAM: Grog, put down your weapon!

1088
01:17:21,707 --> 01:17:26,313
MATT: Let me tell you. If there's anything to turn
Vox Machina away, it's elderly people.

1089
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:33,437
LIAM: I was going to kill my friends, <i>but</i> now
there's this woman here.

1090
01:17:33,437 --> 01:17:36,619
SAM: If I use my bonus action Healing Word, to
heal myself, can I also use my action to cast a

1091
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:38,607
higher level healing word on myself? Or is that--

1092
01:17:38,607 --> 01:17:40,897
MATT: No, it's a bonus action, it's used. Sorry.

1093
01:17:40,897 --> 01:17:55,061
SAM: Okay. Then I will cast Minor Image. Minor
Illusion or whatever it's called. That only has

1094
01:17:55,061 --> 01:18:00,251
60-feet range, 30-feet range, 60-feet range?

1095
01:18:00,251 --> 01:18:05,182
MARISHA: I smell so bad. I'm sweating so much.

1096
01:18:05,182 --> 01:18:07,193
TALIESIN: You're fine! There's nothing.

1097
01:18:07,193 --> 01:18:08,860
MARISHA: I need deodorant.

1098
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:12,404
SAM: Shit. You know what, I'll do Major Image
then. Fine. Fuck it. I'm going to do Major Image

1099
01:18:12,404 --> 01:18:21,213
and it's going to sure look like Scanlan is just
walking right out to the edge of the water right

1100
01:18:21,213 --> 01:18:24,003
there. Not from there.

1101
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:25,886
TALIESIN: Use the cake.

1102
01:18:25,886 --> 01:18:33,260
SAM: He's just going to appear right there, he's
going to come out from around that corner and look

1103
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,271
out like he's looking for a target.

1104
01:18:36,271 --> 01:18:43,648
MATT: Percival, glancing over you can see Scanlan
emerges from around the corner, keeping an eye,

1105
01:18:43,648 --> 01:18:47,230
looking around the battlefield, and doesn't seem
to notice you're there.

1106
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:49,651
SAM: You have to shoot.

1107
01:18:49,651 --> 01:18:52,152
MATT: Well, he wasn't holding an action.

1108
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:53,985
SAM: I thought you said you were holding your
action.

1109
01:18:53,985 --> 01:18:55,298
TALIESIN: I'm holding an action for the tower.

1110
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:59,893
SAM: Got it. Wait, for the tower? I thought you
said "I'm holding an action until I see anyone."

1111
01:18:59,893 --> 01:19:04,092
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye on the tower because
that's where I'm heading next.

1112
01:19:04,092 --> 01:19:06,507
SAM: Okay. That's my action then. I'm done.

1113
01:19:06,507 --> 01:19:09,119
TALIESIN: Don't worry, I will shoot at you.

1114
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:15,880
MATT: Grog. Top of your round. You watch as the
braziers at the base of the tower flare up and

1115
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:20,941
flames consume this outer area just on the
outskirts. Not the top, but just the surrounding

1116
01:19:20,941 --> 01:19:25,568
area of the tower and then die down, the walls of
flame burning to an ember and then vanishing. It's

1117
01:19:25,568 --> 01:19:26,840
your turn.

1118
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:32,881
TRAVIS: Can I come inside here. Can you step on
that?

1119
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:40,736
MATT: It's a small, a sigil raised platform.

1120
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:46,280
TALIESIN: Do it. I dare you.

1121
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,865
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm just curious. I mean it's hard
to--

1122
01:19:48,865 --> 01:19:54,480
TALIESIN: Say yes. When in doubt, say yes. What's
the worst thing that can happen? Other than your

1123
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,230
spells get disenchanted.

1124
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,512
MARISHA: Yes and, Travis.

1125
01:19:57,512 --> 01:19:59,335
TRAVIS: I'll go through the portal.

1126
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:02,928
MATT: Okay. Out the other side you emerge.

1127
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:12,209
TRAVIS: Can I head this way? Can I dash and
continue my action and head towards--

1128
01:20:12,209 --> 01:20:13,867
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1129
01:20:13,867 --> 01:20:19,190
TRAVIS: Head down this way.

1130
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:23,250
MATT: You get right up-- oh god. You get right
about there.

1131
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:31,882
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to use my boots
of feral leaping to jump into the doorway?

1132
01:20:31,882 --> 01:20:35,546
MATT: Sure.

1133
01:20:35,546 --> 01:20:36,990
TRAVIS: No?

1134
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:42,308
MATT: Make an athletics check to see if it
succeeds.

1135
01:20:42,308 --> 01:20:45,276
TALIESIN: I admire your commitment.

1136
01:20:45,276 --> 01:20:46,512
TRAVIS: 27.

1137
01:20:46,512 --> 01:20:49,321
MATT: Okay. Now I need you to make an acrobatics
check for me because it is a very small doorframe

1138
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:53,406
you're trying to leap into.

1139
01:20:53,406 --> 01:20:56,527
TRAVIS: Oh, it's just the one. 13.

1140
01:20:56,527 --> 01:21:06,267
MATT: You do jump, but your head and shoulders
slam into the doorframe. So you get the additional

1141
01:21:06,267 --> 01:21:10,400
leap. You're now in the doorframe, you're
blocking it off. You have a little bit of extra

1142
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,654
movement, but that's as far as you can get. You
have a ringing in your ears and you're like, "That

1143
01:21:14,654 --> 01:21:15,547
"smarts a little bit."

1144
01:21:15,547 --> 01:21:17,724
TRAVIS: That's my whole action.

1145
01:21:17,724 --> 01:21:22,900
MATT: You, as you're there by the chest, you hear
(grunting). You turn around and see Grog in the

1146
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,482
doorway like (grunting), looking at you right in
the face.

1147
01:21:25,482 --> 01:21:27,402
MARISHA: In Terran I say: Hey Grog!

1148
01:21:27,402 --> 01:21:28,461
TRAVIS: Hey!

1149
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:32,484
MATT: That finishes Grog's turn. Vax?

1150
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:34,684
LIAM: Quick question! Already sent.

1151
01:21:34,684 --> 01:21:38,868
MATT: First question: no.

1152
01:21:38,868 --> 01:21:40,037
LIAM: Okay.

1153
01:21:40,037 --> 01:21:42,461
SAM: Second question: six inches soft.

1154
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:46,876
(laughter)

1155
01:21:46,876 --> 01:21:52,022
LIAM: Is that true?! Tell me after. Okay.

1156
01:21:52,022 --> 01:21:54,205
TALIESIN: Wow, man!

1157
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:56,597
MATT: Text your actions!

1158
01:21:56,597 --> 01:22:02,550
TALIESIN: Mid-game! You're asking to get fucked
with!

1159
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:09,233
SAM: Third question.

1160
01:22:09,233 --> 01:22:10,894
LIAM: Yeah, no.

1161
01:22:10,894 --> 01:22:13,546
SAM: Shaved.

1162
01:22:13,546 --> 01:22:24,774
MATT: Jesus! Okay. Good to know. That brings us to
Keyleth.

1163
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,592
MARISHA: Okay!

1164
01:22:26,592 --> 01:22:31,890
MATT: You're now between a chest and blocked door
frame with Grog in it.

1165
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:34,625
SAM: Wait. How the fuck did Grog get all the way
over there?!

1166
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:36,191
TRAVIS: Through the portal over here.

1167
01:22:36,191 --> 01:22:37,507
SAM: That's amazing!

1168
01:22:37,507 --> 01:22:38,871
TRAVIS: I was coming!

1169
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:42,079
TALIESIN: Don't call it a comeback, he's been
there for years.

1170
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:43,282
SAM: That's true.

1171
01:22:43,282 --> 01:22:45,428
LIAM: Vax is somewhere going: You got this.

1172
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:50,305
MATT: Oh, I keep forgetting to ask you. Make a
concentration check when you took damage as a fire

1173
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:53,674
elemental with advantage.

1174
01:22:53,674 --> 01:22:56,787
SAM: If it's anything like Hide &amp; Seek, you'd
probably be like: I really have to pee right now.

1175
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:58,225
LIAM: I would just do it.

1176
01:22:58,225 --> 01:22:59,581
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.

1177
01:22:59,581 --> 01:23:01,744
MATT: With the fire elemental's constitution.

1178
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:09,861
MARISHA: Yeah, that's even better. What do I have
to make? I keep my spell attack, right?

1179
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:12,990
MATT: Yeah, I wanted to see if you lost
concentration on the Sunbeam.

1180
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:14,346
MARISHA: No, I'm good.

1181
01:23:14,346 --> 01:23:20,128
MATT: All right, cool. It was 26 or 27 damage, so
you would have to make a 13 or 14.

1182
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:23,955
MARISHA: Yeah, then I just made it. No, I'm
totally good.

1183
01:23:23,955 --> 01:23:33,112
MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth? You guys are
playing it really safe now!

1184
01:23:33,112 --> 01:23:37,263
TRAVIS: I'm in the doorway with a giant earth
elemental. I punched my ticket; I'm ready to ring

1185
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:38,313
the bell.

1186
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:39,436
MATT: That's true.

1187
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:43,523
SAM: I stuck my face out and I got 140 points of
damage.

1188
01:23:43,523 --> 01:23:46,987
MATT: No, you-- okay.

1189
01:23:46,987 --> 01:23:49,087
TRAVIS: Keyleth's smug. Scanlan's like: Ugh!

1190
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:51,729
MATT: I take it back. One of you is playing it
real safe.

1191
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:53,811
TALIESIN: We're aware!

1192
01:23:53,811 --> 01:23:55,775
SAM: He may not even be playing with us.

1193
01:23:55,775 --> 01:23:58,343
TALIESIN: He is on Twitter right now.

1194
01:23:58,343 --> 01:24:00,692
LIAM: (singing) I stealthed myself out of the
narrative!

1195
01:24:00,692 --> 01:24:03,459
(laughter)

1196
01:24:03,459 --> 01:24:06,177
MATT: What're you doing, Keyleth?

1197
01:24:06,177 --> 01:24:13,291
MARISHA: Can I take Grog and use my slam attacks,
my multiattack, to take him and body slam into

1198
01:24:13,291 --> 01:24:14,748
this chest?

1199
01:24:14,748 --> 01:24:19,046
MATT: Sure, you can certainly try!

1200
01:24:19,046 --> 01:24:21,174
MARISHA: Yeah, sure!

1201
01:24:21,174 --> 01:24:27,218
TRAVIS: If I can jump and smash my head on the door
like an idiot approaching you, might as well tit

1202
01:24:27,218 --> 01:24:29,182
for tat.

1203
01:24:29,182 --> 01:24:31,098
MATT: You first attack would have to be a grapple
attempt.

1204
01:24:31,098 --> 01:24:32,646
MARISHA: My strength versus his, yeah?

1205
01:24:32,646 --> 01:24:34,151
MATT: Your athletics versus his.

1206
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:35,871
MARISHA: I'm just an elemental; it doesn't tell me
that.

1207
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:40,078
MATT: If the elemental doesn't have any athletic
skill, then it's just your strength modifier. Go

1208
01:24:40,078 --> 01:24:41,804
ahead and roll.

1209
01:24:41,804 --> 01:24:46,804
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 18. So that puts me at
23.

1210
01:24:46,804 --> 01:24:48,347
TRAVIS: 19.

1211
01:24:48,347 --> 01:24:55,066
MATT: No shit?! I was not expecting that! Not with
advantage! You reach out and grab, and you have

1212
01:24:55,066 --> 01:24:57,080
Grog. Make your other slam attack.

1213
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,366
MARISHA: Which is a slam attack to hit?

1214
01:24:59,366 --> 01:25:00,828
MATT: Correct.

1215
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:03,925
MARISHA: 17.

1216
01:25:03,925 --> 01:25:07,583
MATT: 17, this is against the chest, technically.
What's your armor class?

1217
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:08,736
TRAVIS: 17.

1218
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:20,345
MATT: Yeah. Okay. You reach and grab Grog. You
slam him and it destroys the chest. It splinters

1219
01:25:20,345 --> 01:25:22,556
underneath. Roll your slam attack damage.

1220
01:25:22,556 --> 01:25:31,201
MARISHA: Which isn't great. Six plus three, nine,
plus five, so 14 damage.

1221
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:33,605
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage to you,
Grog.

1222
01:25:33,605 --> 01:25:34,774
TRAVIS: Seven.

1223
01:25:34,774 --> 01:25:41,085
MATT: You're not prone, but you are moved to the
opposite side of her. The chest is shattered

1224
01:25:41,085 --> 01:25:42,340
beneath you.

1225
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,024
LIAM and SAM: Shit!

1226
01:25:44,024 --> 01:25:46,214
MARISHA: Did it release a poison trap in any way?

1227
01:25:46,214 --> 01:25:51,089
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw. Grog, you make another one as all of a

1228
01:25:51,089 --> 01:25:55,648
sudden, poison gas fills the entirety of the
chamber around you as soon as you destroy this

1229
01:25:55,648 --> 01:25:56,827
chest.

1230
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:58,262
MARISHA: I'm immune to poison.

1231
01:25:58,262 --> 01:25:59,731
MATT: You are unaffected by any of it.

1232
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:04,192
TRAVIS: That's cool. 29. 17 plus 12.

1233
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:05,819
MATT: So you succeed.

1234
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:07,099
SAM: Are you double poisoned?

1235
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:14,062
TRAVIS: I guess so. Start stroking out here in a
second.

1236
01:26:14,062 --> 01:26:22,249
MATT: 18 points of poison damage reduced to nine.

1237
01:26:22,249 --> 01:26:25,868
MARISHA: Does he take poison at the top of each
turn?

1238
01:26:25,868 --> 01:26:28,729
MATT: No, but he's poisoned, so he has
disadvantage on attacks and ability checks until

1239
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:30,802
he gets rid of the poison.

1240
01:26:30,802 --> 01:26:33,322
TRAVIS: Can I make a retaliation? Is that
considered melee?

1241
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:35,347
MATT: Against her? Yeah, I'll allow it.

1242
01:26:35,347 --> 01:26:37,260
TRAVIS: But I'm prone.

1243
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:41,570
MATT: You're not prone. She just moved you over
and slammed you into it. You managed to maneuver

1244
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:47,280
and get back on your feet, but your impact against the
chest destroyed it and released the trap inside.

1245
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,942
TRAVIS: I haven't been able to say this in a long
time: Can I make this Reckless, Great Weapon

1246
01:26:49,942 --> 01:26:51,110
Master?

1247
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:53,013
MATT: You can, but you have disadvantage on the
attack because of the poison, so it's just a

1248
01:26:53,013 --> 01:26:54,369
single strike.

1249
01:26:54,369 --> 01:26:56,513
TRAVIS: 26.

1250
01:26:56,513 --> 01:26:57,705
MARISHA: That hits for sure.

1251
01:26:57,705 --> 01:27:00,887
TALIESIN: It's going to make life complicated.

1252
01:27:00,887 --> 01:27:02,320
SAM: Yeah, I know!

1253
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,651
TALIESIN: I've got shit I can do, but it's going
to be tricky.

1254
01:27:04,651 --> 01:27:06,284
SAM: You have to see the people you're doing it
to.

1255
01:27:06,284 --> 01:27:07,360
TRAVIS: 32.

1256
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,888
MATT: 32 points of slashing damage.

1257
01:27:08,888 --> 01:27:10,893
MARISHA: Ooh! It's pretty good!

1258
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:18,781
TALIESIN: That was foolish of you. Well, I don't
know. You always have a plan. I ain't going to

1259
01:27:18,781 --> 01:27:19,947
push it.

1260
01:27:19,947 --> 01:27:21,065
SAM: I don't have a plan tonight.

1261
01:27:21,065 --> 01:27:22,194
TALIESIN: I don't believe you.

1262
01:27:22,194 --> 01:27:26,607
MARISHA: Did I break any potions that were under
him when I slammed him into the chest?

1263
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:31,021
MATT: Right now, the whole place is filled with
poison smoke. You have no idea.

1264
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:34,377
MARISHA: I'm going to take my movement to get the
fuck out of here.

1265
01:27:34,377 --> 01:27:38,727
MATT: You have full movement, he already used his
reaction so he doesn't get an attack of

1266
01:27:38,727 --> 01:27:40,318
opportunity on you.

1267
01:27:40,318 --> 01:27:50,170
MARISHA: Can I go 20, use my bonus action to turn
into a water elemental and then dive under this

1268
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,439
water?

1269
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:53,676
TRAVIS: How many elementals can you turn into?

1270
01:27:53,676 --> 01:27:55,002
MARISHA: All of them.

1271
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:56,712
TRAVIS: An unlimited number of times?

1272
01:27:56,712 --> 01:28:00,527
MARISHA: Yeah. Archdruid shit.

1273
01:28:00,527 --> 01:28:04,037
MATT: You are submerged in this water.

1274
01:28:04,037 --> 01:28:06,937
TALIESIN: It's why Scanlan's not dead yet. I just
wanted to make him desperate.

1275
01:28:06,937 --> 01:28:08,418
TRAVIS: Oh.

1276
01:28:08,418 --> 01:28:10,523
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn.

1277
01:28:10,523 --> 01:28:11,853
MARISHA: That ends my turn!

1278
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:18,012
MATT: Percival, you're up. You turn around and you
watch around the corner you have Scanlan peeking

1279
01:28:18,012 --> 01:28:22,268
around one side and you have Keyleth coming out as
an earth elemental, turning into a water elemental

1280
01:28:22,268 --> 01:28:25,088
then disappearing beneath the surface of the
water.

1281
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,967
TALIESIN: I can't see anything else?

1282
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:29,602
MATT: Nope. But you did hear the impact.

1283
01:28:29,602 --> 01:28:31,016
TALIESIN: No, I didn't.

1284
01:28:31,016 --> 01:28:32,581
MARISHA: Can't hear shit.

1285
01:28:32,581 --> 01:28:34,235
MATT: Oh, right. Silence, yeah.

1286
01:28:34,235 --> 01:28:36,843
TRAVIS: There's a giant tidal wave moving yonder.

1287
01:28:36,843 --> 01:28:42,648
TALIESIN: There's a bard over there. I'm going to
take a jump onto that island.

1288
01:28:42,648 --> 01:28:46,379
MARISHA: I'm stealthing, if that was not clear.
Hiding under there.

1289
01:28:46,379 --> 01:28:52,622
TALIESIN: Acrobatics check. That's 24.

1290
01:28:52,622 --> 01:28:54,371
MATT: 24.

1291
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,892
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend the rest of my movement
running straight up that tower.

1292
01:28:57,892 --> 01:29:10,147
MATT: Okay! As you enter the tower--

1293
01:29:10,147 --> 01:29:14,479
TALIESIN: I'm not entering the tower. I'm running
up the tower. Sorry. My fault.

1294
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:17,936
MATT: Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

1295
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:19,669
TALIESIN: And then double run.

1296
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:25,553
MATT: You're up on the tower now. As you get to
the top of the tower, you glance over and the

1297
01:29:25,553 --> 01:29:34,145
column of green energy that was left behind when
Colville vanished sits there, creating this beam.

1298
01:29:34,145 --> 01:29:40,753
This central, circular area right there is infused
with soft, sparkling, greenish energy.

1299
01:29:40,753 --> 01:29:47,424
TALIESIN: Huh. I've been having bad luck with that
lately.

1300
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,871
TRAVIS: The whole top of the tower, or just the
middle of it?

1301
01:29:49,871 --> 01:29:51,672
MATT: Just the center circle.

1302
01:29:51,672 --> 01:29:53,248
TRAVIS: Is there a latch?

1303
01:29:53,248 --> 01:29:56,313
MATT: There is a trap door over that.

1304
01:29:56,313 --> 01:30:04,727
TALIESIN: I'm going to take cover from Scanlan
right there with what's left of my movement

1305
01:30:04,727 --> 01:30:06,472
against one of the walls.

1306
01:30:06,472 --> 01:30:07,994
MATT: You back up against the wall.

1307
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:10,863
TALIESIN: I'm backing up against the wall and
that's my turn.

1308
01:30:10,863 --> 01:30:15,693
MATT: You currently have three-quarters cover in
that space.

1309
01:30:15,693 --> 01:30:17,035
TALIESIN: Okay. That'll do.

1310
01:30:17,035 --> 01:30:20,550
MATT: Ending Percival's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

1311
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:21,880
SAM: Bonus action: Healing Word.

1312
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:26,972
MATT: Yes. So you're holding your Major Image of
Scanlan out there right now. Grog, you saw enter

1313
01:30:26,972 --> 01:30:29,127
the chamber and vanish into the doorway.

1314
01:30:29,127 --> 01:30:35,263
SAM: Do I know where that goes? No. I don't know
how those things work. I heard a bunch of smashing

1315
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:40,270
kitty-corner to me and I haven't seen anything
else.

1316
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:41,130
MATT: Nope!

1317
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,004
SAM: Cool.

1318
01:30:42,004 --> 01:30:44,809
TRAVIS: You could stand on that thing, though, the
platform.

1319
01:30:44,809 --> 01:30:46,805
SAM: What?

1320
01:30:46,805 --> 01:30:51,045
TRAVIS: It looks super-magical, this thing. It's
awesome. There's even little feet right here.

1321
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:52,726
SAM: That sounds great.

1322
01:30:52,726 --> 01:30:54,850
TRAVIS: I don't know what those are. Are they
boots?

1323
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:59,448
MARISHA: Stand here. Yeah, you beat me to it!

1324
01:30:59,448 --> 01:31:13,279
SAM: I'm going to have Major Image Scanlan ice
skate across the water in a jaunty way.

1325
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:14,558
TRAVIS: Ice skating?

1326
01:31:14,558 --> 01:31:17,339
SAM: He's walking on water, as I've always wanted
to do.

1327
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:19,676
MARISHA and TRAVIS: You can do that?!

1328
01:31:19,676 --> 01:31:21,327
SAM: He's not a real thing.

1329
01:31:21,327 --> 01:31:22,739
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

1330
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:38,072
SAM: He can do anything. He's going to walk across
the water going, "Hey! Over here! Hey!" While he's

1331
01:31:38,072 --> 01:31:41,664
creating that distraction, I'm going to peek
around and see if I see anything around the

1332
01:31:41,664 --> 01:31:42,714
tower.

1333
01:31:42,714 --> 01:31:43,635
MATT: Around this way?

1334
01:31:43,635 --> 01:31:44,431
SAM: Yeah.

1335
01:31:44,431 --> 01:31:46,440
MATT: You peek around the tower there.

1336
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:47,362
SAM: Anything?

1337
01:31:47,362 --> 01:31:55,994
MATT: Make a perception check, please. I would
like you to make a perception check as well.

1338
01:31:55,994 --> 01:31:57,751
SAM: 15.

1339
01:31:57,751 --> 01:32:04,130
MATT: You glance around. You can see, just on the
top of the tower, shoulder against the area, the

1340
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:09,661
outer edge of Percival's form holding his gun up
and taking cover right up on the side there.

1341
01:32:09,661 --> 01:32:10,798
SAM: Okay, I duck back.

1342
01:32:10,798 --> 01:32:15,754
LIAM: Where's my Colville die?

1343
01:32:15,754 --> 01:32:17,289
MATT: End of your turn, Scanlan?

1344
01:32:17,289 --> 01:32:18,258
SAM: That's it, yeah.

1345
01:32:18,258 --> 01:32:25,640
MATT: The flames burst from the braziers around
the tower. The entire area incinerates around the

1346
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:26,823
outside.

1347
01:32:26,823 --> 01:32:28,328
TALIESIN: It did that last round.

1348
01:32:28,328 --> 01:32:29,994
MATT: You're right, I marked that incorrectly.

1349
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:31,697
TALIESIN: I've been keeping track.

1350
01:32:31,697 --> 01:32:38,802
MATT: I forgot to mark that. You watch as the two
separate towers give off a burst of lightning

1351
01:32:38,802 --> 01:32:49,816
energy and do not affect anybody. Keyleth, you
notice this. As you're inside the water, which is

1352
01:32:49,816 --> 01:32:51,830
just regular water.

1353
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:52,978
MARISHA: Good!

1354
01:32:52,978 --> 01:32:58,700
MATT: As you're swimming through it, regular
water. Not terribly deep, it's about three or four

1355
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:03,968
feet deep. You're flattening form as a water
elemental to hide beneath the surface. You get the

1356
01:33:03,968 --> 01:33:11,468
sense the water around you is starting to vibrate
a little bit. There's a strange effervescence to

1357
01:33:11,468 --> 01:33:16,535
it that wasn't there a moment ago. That's all.
Grog, you're up.

1358
01:33:16,535 --> 01:33:21,337
LIAM: I sent a question and the answer to your
roll, too. Sorry.

1359
01:33:21,337 --> 01:33:23,631
TALIESIN: Wonderful bottle of Pellegrino for the
table.

1360
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:25,340
SAM: Naturally sparkling.

1361
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:30,088
MATT: You rolled 27? You heard (footsteps).

1362
01:33:30,088 --> 01:33:34,289
TALIESIN: No, you wouldn't have heard. Ten feet.

1363
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:36,283
MATT: That's right.

1364
01:33:36,283 --> 01:33:37,529
TALIESIN: Sorry, didn't hear it.

1365
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:38,833
MATT: Nothing.

1366
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:43,120
TRAVIS: Silent motherfucker. You're a goddamn Navy
SEAL.

1367
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:50,732
TALIESIN: This is why in a normal game this would be
completely crippling me because anything could be

1368
01:33:50,732 --> 01:33:56,198
happening and you could not tell me. But on a solo
mission, it's pretty nice.

1369
01:33:56,198 --> 01:34:01,356
TRAVIS: In the room that I'm in, can I see
anything on the floor since I've been poisoned

1370
01:34:01,356 --> 01:34:02,673
fucking twice now?!

1371
01:34:02,673 --> 01:34:10,034
MATT: The cloud dissipates. You said you
want to sift through the rubble?

1372
01:34:10,034 --> 01:34:11,852
TRAVIS: To see if there's a potion.

1373
01:34:11,852 --> 01:34:13,390
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1374
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,855
TRAVIS: Hey! Minus how much? Two. 13!

1375
01:34:16,855 --> 01:34:23,639
MATT: You spend your action rummaging through the
shattered remains of this. You find bits of the

1376
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:30,121
trap mechanism within there and you find a
shattered glass vial with trace elements of a

1377
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:32,609
healing potion that has since been destroyed.

1378
01:34:32,609 --> 01:34:35,111
TRAVIS: Can I get down and (licking)?

1379
01:34:35,111 --> 01:34:41,453
MATT: You do! You get down there. You get a
familiar weird medicinal, herbal flavor that is

1380
01:34:41,453 --> 01:34:45,027
mingled with shards of glass that are gathering on
the outskirts of your tongue.

1381
01:34:45,027 --> 01:34:53,961
TRAVIS: Not worth it. Okay. Yeah, let's see what
happens. Can I run out of the room? I'm going to

1382
01:34:53,961 --> 01:35:02,208
head towards the back portal. Actually, can I get
to here? She's in the water, right? She's not

1383
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:03,810
sticking out some?

1384
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,255
MATT: Make a perception check.

1385
01:35:05,255 --> 01:35:08,261
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

1386
01:35:08,261 --> 01:35:14,347
MATT: You glance over and you can see in the water
the slight, very different movement of the water.

1387
01:35:14,347 --> 01:35:19,759
You can basically see a slight form in there. Only
because you rolled really high.

1388
01:35:19,759 --> 01:35:22,856
MARISHA: Man, you beat me last time with a really
high roll.

1389
01:35:22,856 --> 01:35:28,928
TRAVIS: I'm an idiot, but you have to be really dumb
to go chopping at the water with an axe. It's just

1390
01:35:28,928 --> 01:35:30,159
water.

1391
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:35,210
SAM: You would be just dumb enough to do that.

1392
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,269
TALIESIN: Only a truly dumb person.

1393
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:40,765
TRAVIS: She's just going to change again.

1394
01:35:40,765 --> 01:35:44,622
MATT: You used 25 of your movement, you still have
25 left. You've used your action.

1395
01:35:44,622 --> 01:35:58,537
TRAVIS: I'll keep running to the entranceway and
I'll stay outside. Do I have any more movement?

1396
01:35:58,537 --> 01:36:00,386
MATT: You have five feet more.

1397
01:36:00,386 --> 01:36:01,972
TRAVIS: I can't get around the corner, right?

1398
01:36:01,972 --> 01:36:05,179
MATT: Nah, you'd have to move next to it.

1399
01:36:05,179 --> 01:36:06,591
TRAVIS: I'm good.

1400
01:36:06,591 --> 01:36:10,332
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

1401
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:18,848
SAM: (sings with background music)

1402
01:36:18,848 --> 01:36:23,119
TRAVIS: Should have a countdown clock.

1403
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:28,829
SAM: (sings with background music)

1404
01:36:28,829 --> 01:36:30,474
LIAM: There.

1405
01:36:30,474 --> 01:36:31,936
MATT: All righty.

1406
01:36:31,936 --> 01:36:34,644
SAM: Man, Liam's RP is so good tonight!

1407
01:36:34,644 --> 01:36:39,520
MATT: That ends Vax's turn, Keyleth, you're up.

1408
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:44,061
LIAM: Hey man, I took my heart out and did this
for 115 episodes, all right?! Staying alive!

1409
01:36:44,061 --> 01:36:46,257
SAM: The last move, though, was so goth!

1410
01:36:46,257 --> 01:36:53,553
MARISHA: I'm going to come out of the water like
the Swamp Thing. I'm going to beam Grog with

1411
01:36:53,553 --> 01:36:55,089
another Sunbeam.

1412
01:36:55,089 --> 01:37:00,462
MATT: Grog, as you're waiting on the side, you
hear the ripple of water as you glance over. You

1413
01:37:00,462 --> 01:37:07,406
watch this giant wave as Keyleth's elemental
form emerges from the water. Out of the middle of

1414
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:10,279
it, this beam of energy. I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

1415
01:37:10,279 --> 01:37:22,367
TRAVIS: Wait. Mage Slayer. Advantage on saving
throws against spells? I have to be in melee of

1416
01:37:22,367 --> 01:37:23,412
them.

1417
01:37:23,412 --> 01:37:24,898
MATT: You might have to be in melee?

1418
01:37:24,898 --> 01:37:26,230
TRAVIS: I think that might be right.

1419
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:27,759
MATT: I'll double check, just to be safe.

1420
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:33,196
TRAVIS: I'm poisoned, so I have disadvantage on
saves, right?

1421
01:37:33,196 --> 01:37:35,275
MATT: "Against spells cast within five feet of
you."

1422
01:37:35,275 --> 01:37:37,978
TRAVIS: Because I'm poisoned, I have to roll this
again for disadvantage?

1423
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:40,998
MATT: Poisoned just gives you disadvantage on
ability checks and attacks.

1424
01:37:40,998 --> 01:37:42,257
TRAVIS: Not saving throws?

1425
01:37:42,257 --> 01:37:43,269
MATT: Correct.

1426
01:37:43,269 --> 01:37:44,718
TRAVIS: 25.

1427
01:37:44,718 --> 01:37:47,258
MATT: Yeah, you take half damage and you're not
blinded.

1428
01:37:47,258 --> 01:37:48,406
TRAVIS: Oh, cool.

1429
01:37:48,406 --> 01:38:01,334
MARISHA: Your half damage is a ten, (counting) 21.
Not a great roll this go around.

1430
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:08,753
MATT: You take ten points of radiant damage.
Blasted, it burns past your skin. It tickles a

1431
01:38:08,753 --> 01:38:10,591
little. It's like a bad sunburn.

1432
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:15,688
MARISHA: I'm going to go into my earth elemental
form and--

1433
01:38:15,688 --> 01:38:21,499
TALIESIN: This is disturbing. I don't know what to
do about this.

1434
01:38:21,499 --> 01:38:22,767
LIAM: Die!

1435
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:25,059
TRAVIS: Probably not kill the other caster, you
know.

1436
01:38:25,059 --> 01:38:26,422
TALIESIN: I didn't!

1437
01:38:26,422 --> 01:38:31,930
MARISHA: Is this an actual window here?

1438
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:37,844
MATT: They're small slits that you can see
through, but that's it.

1439
01:38:37,844 --> 01:38:40,032
MARISHA: Okay! Yeah. Sure.

1440
01:38:40,032 --> 01:38:44,451
MATT: That ends your turn. Percival.

1441
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:48,992
TALIESIN: God. I didn't see her do that, did I?

1442
01:38:48,992 --> 01:38:52,478
MATT: No. From where you're standing, you heard
the blast.

1443
01:38:52,478 --> 01:38:53,676
MARISHA: He can't hear shit.

1444
01:38:53,676 --> 01:38:57,848
MATT: No, that's right! Silence spell, man. It's
creepily quiet.

1445
01:38:57,848 --> 01:39:02,402
TRAVIS: You take the good, you take the bad, you
take them both and then you have Percy silence.

1446
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:04,461
LIAM: Take your die of inspiration.

1447
01:39:04,461 --> 01:39:12,489
TALIESIN: I'm so fucked. Yep. This is dumb, but
I'm going to do it because I don't know you're

1448
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:19,055
there. I'm going to walk over to that weird little
door.

1449
01:39:19,055 --> 01:39:29,952
MATT: You walk into the greenish energy. As you
step into this field, your body feels warm. No

1450
01:39:29,952 --> 01:39:33,151
sound.

1451
01:39:33,151 --> 01:39:35,528
TALIESIN: I just feel warm.

1452
01:39:35,528 --> 01:39:37,050
MATT: You just feel warm.

1453
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:38,284
MARISHA: It's a patio heater.

1454
01:39:38,284 --> 01:39:42,301
TALIESIN: I'm going to open the door and see
what's in there.

1455
01:39:42,301 --> 01:39:46,792
MATT: As you go to pull for the door, it (clicks).
I mean, you don't hear a sound, but it resists.

1456
01:39:46,792 --> 01:39:48,783
LIAM: Oh, blew your action.

1457
01:39:48,783 --> 01:39:57,540
MARISHA: Man, we get so catty when we can! It's so
much fun!

1458
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,378
LIAM: This is all I've got.

1459
01:39:59,378 --> 01:40:01,674
MARISHA: We're never mean to each other, you
guys.

1460
01:40:01,674 --> 01:40:07,217
TALIESIN: All right, just because this green glow
is freaking me out, I'm going to back up against

1461
01:40:07,217 --> 01:40:10,627
the wall and then my next action later is going to
be--

1462
01:40:10,627 --> 01:40:12,186
MATT: Have you taken any damage?

1463
01:40:12,186 --> 01:40:15,476
TALIESIN: Have I taken any? Yeah, I've taken 16
points of damage.

1464
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:25,250
MATT: Okay, you sense as you're stepping in there,
not immediately but the sensation is that similar

1465
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:32,036
to one of your allies were to cast a Cure Wounds
on you, it has a sort of regenerative property to

1466
01:40:32,036 --> 01:40:35,050
it, the longer you stand in it. It hasn't taken
effect yet.

1467
01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:38,944
TALIESIN: Okay, then I'm not going to back up out
of it, I'm going to get to the back side of the

1468
01:40:38,944 --> 01:40:45,639
hinge and I can't hold an action, obviously,
because I blew my action, but I'm going to prepare

1469
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:48,901
to open and worry about what comes out.

1470
01:40:48,901 --> 01:40:52,252
MATT: Okay, so you go up into the very edge of
that radius and just hold your weapon.

1471
01:40:52,252 --> 01:40:53,298
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1472
01:40:53,298 --> 01:40:56,054
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Scanlan, you're
up.

1473
01:40:56,054 --> 01:41:01,300
SAM: Hi guys, Scanlan Shorthalt here.

1474
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:05,269
TALIESIN: With a very important message about
Marvel Puzzle Quest.

1475
01:41:05,269 --> 01:41:07,110
MARISHA: I like your crown.

1476
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:08,758
SAM: Thanks.

1477
01:41:08,758 --> 01:41:11,810
TALIESIN: It's nice, it would look good on me.

1478
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:17,928
SAM: It's lofty. Knowing where Percy is, I'm going
to peek around the corner.

1479
01:41:17,928 --> 01:41:26,441
MATT: Peek around the corner, at this view, you do
not have eyeline on Percival.

1480
01:41:26,441 --> 01:41:28,328
SAM: Sure, but I kind of know he's up there.

1481
01:41:28,328 --> 01:41:29,629
MATT: You know he's up on the tower.

1482
01:41:29,629 --> 01:41:31,808
SAM: And I heard booms distantly over here.

1483
01:41:31,808 --> 01:41:38,051
MATT: You did, you heard thuds of impacts and a
burst of energy, you saw like a bright light glow

1484
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:40,460
up over the distant sky for a moment.

1485
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:44,062
SAM: Feeling a red-hot anger towards Percy for
shooting me--

1486
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:45,708
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. Bring it.

1487
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:53,400
SAM: And also gaming out that there's people over
here, right centered on this spot I'm going to cast

1488
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,802
Anti-Gravity.

1489
01:41:54,802 --> 01:41:58,227
MATT: Reverse Gravity?

1490
01:41:58,227 --> 01:41:59,511
SAM: Reverse Gravity.

1491
01:41:59,511 --> 01:42:00,748
MATT: Okay, on that spot.

1492
01:42:00,748 --> 01:42:03,155
MARISHA: Okay, that's fun.

1493
01:42:03,155 --> 01:42:08,595
MATT: All right, your illusion fades, it's
concentration.

1494
01:42:08,595 --> 01:42:14,514
MARISHA: That's one spell I wish we got to use
more in-campaign, it's a fun one.

1495
01:42:14,514 --> 01:42:18,045
MATT: Bringing it back.

1496
01:42:18,045 --> 01:42:20,761
SAM: 50-foot radius.

1497
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:25,309
MATT: 50-foot radius which would also affect
Keyleth.

1498
01:42:25,309 --> 01:42:27,391
SAM: Keyleth for sure.

1499
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:29,020
TALIESIN: And anybody in the tower.

1500
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:40,171
MATT: Yep. All right so I need Keyleth and
Percival to both make a dexterity saving throw.

1501
01:42:40,171 --> 01:42:43,127
TALIESIN: What about my Boots of Spider Climbing
that are currently activated?

1502
01:42:43,127 --> 01:42:47,454
MATT: I need Keyleth to make a dexterity saving
throw.

1503
01:42:47,454 --> 01:42:49,848
MARISHA: This is going to be bad.

1504
01:42:49,848 --> 01:42:53,177
SAM: Are they always attached? Nice!

1505
01:42:53,177 --> 01:42:59,203
TALIESIN: They're activated, I ain't moving. I
can't be knocked prone, you can't do shit.

1506
01:42:59,203 --> 01:43:00,460
MARISHA: 12.

1507
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:02,286
MATT: 12? No.

1508
01:43:02,286 --> 01:43:05,882
MARISHA: All right, let's go for a ride.

1509
01:43:05,882 --> 01:43:07,059
SAM: 100 feet up.

1510
01:43:07,059 --> 01:43:10,726
MARISHA: Whee!

1511
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:15,876
MATT: (counting) That's 50.

1512
01:43:15,876 --> 01:43:18,920
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1513
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:21,916
MATT: This is going to be interesting.

1514
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:29,533
SAM: Because you said the top is like 90 feet up,
so I want her to go all the way up to the

1515
01:43:29,533 --> 01:43:30,593
ceiling.

1516
01:43:30,593 --> 01:43:31,995
TALIESIN: And then see what happens.

1517
01:43:31,995 --> 01:43:35,250
TRAVIS: A little unintentional Keyteor.

1518
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:37,514
MARISHA: Yeah, a hundred percent.

1519
01:43:37,514 --> 01:43:44,381
MATT: Keyleth, you suddenly go firing up into the
sky. Percival, you watch as Keyleth spins up,

1520
01:43:44,381 --> 01:43:51,699
slams into the top of the field, I need you to
make a constitution saving throw.

1521
01:43:51,699 --> 01:43:58,139
MARISHA: Just a straight con save? Not good,
seven.

1522
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:09,652
MATT: You take 29 points of force damage as you
slam into the field, and then it thrusts you 15

1523
01:44:09,652 --> 01:44:12,711
feet away from it, and then you head back towards
it.

1524
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:14,405
TRAVIS: Do the basketball.

1525
01:44:14,405 --> 01:44:16,645
TALIESIN: Oh no, oh no.

1526
01:44:16,645 --> 01:44:23,722
MATT: So it won't affect you this round, but
you're currently being just bludgeoned repeatedly.

1527
01:44:23,722 --> 01:44:29,110
Percival, your hair is standing up on end above
you.

1528
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:30,857
MARISHA: This is like some Freddie Krueger shit.

1529
01:44:30,857 --> 01:44:36,121
MATT: You take a moment to try and right yourself
and are now finding yourself having to fly upside

1530
01:44:36,121 --> 01:44:37,355
down.

1531
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:38,748
LIAM: But that's the same shit, right?

1532
01:44:38,748 --> 01:44:43,301
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. It doesn't do anything to
you, but it took you a moment to readjust.

1533
01:44:43,301 --> 01:44:46,956
SAM: I'll duck back behind the thing.

1534
01:44:46,956 --> 01:44:48,324
LIAM: And nobody knows where I am.

1535
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:53,025
TRAVIS: Yeah, we know, okay, we know. AT&amp;T thanks
you for your texts.

1536
01:44:53,025 --> 01:45:00,677
SAM: And I will say: drat, it didn't work on
Percy. I'll use my bonus action to say: Percy, I

1537
01:45:00,677 --> 01:45:02,130
wasn't aiming at you!

1538
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,454
MATT: He doesn't hear it.

1539
01:45:03,454 --> 01:45:05,016
SAM: Shit! He doesn't hear anything!

1540
01:45:05,016 --> 01:45:07,740
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn.

1541
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:12,751
TALIESIN: I have been waiting to use this Silence
spell like an asshole this entire game.

1542
01:45:12,751 --> 01:45:18,634
LIAM: I rolled a 21 for that roll. That didn't do
it, did it? I sent you my roll. They rolled, so

1543
01:45:18,634 --> 01:45:20,594
did I. I texted you a 21.

1544
01:45:20,594 --> 01:45:24,729
MATT: It didn't affect anything because you were
flying.

1545
01:45:24,729 --> 01:45:26,199
LIAM: Oh, okay.

1546
01:45:26,199 --> 01:45:30,246
MATT: You had to right yourself, but as soon as
you started flying upward, you went, "Oh crap!"

1547
01:45:30,246 --> 01:45:40,575
and you caught yourself. That brings us to Grog's
turn at the top of the round. Keyleth and Scanlan,

1548
01:45:40,575 --> 01:45:46,628
definitely not Percival. Grog, you notice this,
too. Behind the entire chamber on each side, it

1549
01:45:46,628 --> 01:45:51,935
suddenly fills and flashes with that purplish-blue
energy. The energy travels through the center and

1550
01:45:51,935 --> 01:46:00,548
all the water and surrounding also flashes
once with that same purple-blue flash and then

1551
01:46:00,548 --> 01:46:07,407
dissipates and returns to what it was before. You
now notice that those rooms are connected to the

1552
01:46:07,407 --> 01:46:10,868
water and whatever's in the water when that goes
off--

1553
01:46:10,868 --> 01:46:12,365
MARISHA: That was the blue spheres?

1554
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:14,257
MATT: No, that was the purple.

1555
01:46:14,257 --> 01:46:16,519
TALIESIN: Purple horseshoes.

1556
01:46:16,519 --> 01:46:18,603
LIAM: TGIF Flair.

1557
01:46:18,603 --> 01:46:19,928
MATT: Grog, you're up.

1558
01:46:19,928 --> 01:46:29,233
TRAVIS: I'm going to go into the room. Can I stand
on the crystal circle? Because I don't see anybody

1559
01:46:29,233 --> 01:46:30,478
else to hit.

1560
01:46:30,478 --> 01:46:32,411
MATT: You step onto the crystal circle.

1561
01:46:32,411 --> 01:46:36,518
TRAVIS: I concentrate real hard.

1562
01:46:36,518 --> 01:46:39,069
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1563
01:46:39,069 --> 01:46:42,751
TRAVIS: Nine.

1564
01:46:42,751 --> 01:46:47,096
MATT: It's hard to concentrate. It's really warm
under your feet.

1565
01:46:47,096 --> 01:46:52,415
TRAVIS: That's it? Do I notice any writing or
bones around the circle?

1566
01:46:52,415 --> 01:46:58,140
MATT: No. It's pretty clear. But you're a few
inches taller than you were a second ago because

1567
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,016
you're on the platform. That's cool.

1568
01:47:00,016 --> 01:47:03,504
TRAVIS: I don't see anybody. Does it go out to the
water?

1569
01:47:03,504 --> 01:47:05,411
MATT: Yes, it opens up out to the water.

1570
01:47:05,411 --> 01:47:11,797
TRAVIS: Did I happen to see Keyleth in her earth
elemental form, since I was outside, go whoosh and

1571
01:47:11,797 --> 01:47:12,779
fly up?

1572
01:47:12,779 --> 01:47:14,361
MATT: Yes. You're watching her being--

1573
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:20,634
TRAVIS: That seems wrong. Okay. I'm going to use
my bonus action to take one of my superior healing

1574
01:47:20,634 --> 01:47:22,718
potions and that's my turn.

1575
01:47:22,718 --> 01:47:24,368
MATT: 8d4 plus eight.

1576
01:47:24,368 --> 01:47:27,888
LIAM: Sent you a monologue.

1577
01:47:27,888 --> 01:47:31,136
TALIESIN: O for a muse of fire!

1578
01:47:31,136 --> 01:47:34,421
LIAM: To be or not to be!

1579
01:47:34,421 --> 01:47:39,841
MATT: Keyleth, you're up!

1580
01:47:39,841 --> 01:47:42,143
TALIESIN: And down. And up and down.

1581
01:47:42,143 --> 01:47:48,597
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into an air elemental and fly.

1582
01:47:48,597 --> 01:47:52,617
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. Not cool!

1583
01:47:52,617 --> 01:47:55,683
MARISHA: I'm so hot. So sexy.

1584
01:47:55,683 --> 01:47:57,841
MATT: What's your fly speed?

1585
01:47:57,841 --> 01:48:05,468
MARISHA: My fly speed: 90 feet.

1586
01:48:05,468 --> 01:48:09,614
MATT: Yeah, you can get to Percival. You could get
to a lot of places from here.

1587
01:48:09,614 --> 01:48:14,338
MARISHA: How many rounds has it been? Do we know,
roughly?

1588
01:48:14,338 --> 01:48:16,856
MATT: It's been nine rounds.

1589
01:48:16,856 --> 01:48:20,745
MARISHA: Nine rounds. Then I'll use my last round
to--

1590
01:48:20,745 --> 01:48:22,340
MATT: You have one more round--

1591
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:30,971
MARISHA: --of Sunbeam. This is my last round,
right? I'm going to fly directly above Percy.

1592
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:41,873
Looking down over top of him a good 60 feet almost
exactly and right below me going to do my Sunbeam

1593
01:48:41,873 --> 01:48:43,486
down on top of his head.

1594
01:48:43,486 --> 01:48:55,991
MATT: You also enter the healing column. I need
you to roll a constitution saving throw,

1595
01:48:55,991 --> 01:48:57,189
Percival.

1596
01:48:57,189 --> 01:48:58,854
LIAM: Like the satellite in Akira!

1597
01:48:58,854 --> 01:49:05,369
TALIESIN: That's a constitutitution saving? Where's
my constitution? There we go.

1598
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:11,099
SAM: Pretty good!

1599
01:49:11,099 --> 01:49:12,189
TALIESIN: 24.

1600
01:49:12,189 --> 01:49:16,594
MARISHA: Fuck! Fucking no one did! Fucking
everyone!

1601
01:49:16,594 --> 01:49:22,686
TRAVIS: Not me, I'm loving it. I've hit one
person.

1602
01:49:22,686 --> 01:49:24,981
LIAM: I've hit zero persons.

1603
01:49:24,981 --> 01:49:26,312
TRAVIS: I know.

1604
01:49:26,312 --> 01:49:28,350
MARISHA: 25 damage.

1605
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:36,684
MATT: Halve that to 12. You take 12 points of
radiant damage, Percival, and you shield your eyes

1606
01:49:36,684 --> 01:49:43,481
just in time as the blast hits you from above
to have it not affect your vision.

1607
01:49:43,481 --> 01:49:44,931
TALIESIN: That ain't bad.

1608
01:49:44,931 --> 01:49:48,633
MATT: You still have about 60 feet of movement if
you want, Keyleth.

1609
01:49:48,633 --> 01:49:58,681
MARISHA: I'll fly that way to that corner.

1610
01:49:58,681 --> 01:50:12,345
MATT: Staying that far up. You can't fly quite
that high up with this range because the ceiling

1611
01:50:12,345 --> 01:50:13,783
is there.

1612
01:50:13,783 --> 01:50:15,546
MARISHA: Don't look at me like that!

1613
01:50:15,546 --> 01:50:19,332
TRAVIS: You don't have to make concentration
checks when you take damage, right? You just stay

1614
01:50:19,332 --> 01:50:21,104
elemental. You're that.

1615
01:50:21,104 --> 01:50:25,849
MARISHA: As the elemental, yes. It's my Sunbeam
that I've been rolling concentration checks

1616
01:50:25,849 --> 01:50:26,749
against.

1617
01:50:26,749 --> 01:50:27,591
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

1618
01:50:27,591 --> 01:50:34,515
TALIESIN: She's got Cyclops laser until we hit her
hard enough. Hey, look who you can see now!

1619
01:50:34,515 --> 01:50:39,857
MARISHA: I'm War Caster with pretty high wisdom,
so I'm trying to make it easier to not fail a

1620
01:50:39,857 --> 01:50:41,204
concentration check.

1621
01:50:41,204 --> 01:50:42,236
SAM: Oh Jesus!

1622
01:50:42,236 --> 01:50:43,338
TALIESIN: Look who you see now!

1623
01:50:43,338 --> 01:50:44,388
MARISHA: Oh, do I see Scanlan?

1624
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:47,757
MATT: You do now! As you float over, you see the
tiny little gnome, right there on the ground.

1625
01:50:47,757 --> 01:50:49,293
TALIESIN: Good-bye.

1626
01:50:49,293 --> 01:50:52,012
MARISHA: (helicopter imitation) LAPD! (helicopter
imitation)

1627
01:50:52,012 --> 01:50:55,981
TALIESIN: Wow, that's a local joke right there!

1628
01:50:55,981 --> 01:51:01,503
TRAVIS: It'll only be there for four and a half hours from
12:30 to 3:30.

1629
01:51:01,503 --> 01:51:03,867
TALIESIN: They're already on their way in the
helicopter.

1630
01:51:03,867 --> 01:51:05,492
MATT: End of your turn, Keyleth?

1631
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,017
MARISHA: Yeah, end of my turn.

1632
01:51:07,017 --> 01:51:11,581
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn and we're going to
go to a break because we're at a break point here.

1633
01:51:11,581 --> 01:51:23,701
We'll come back here shortly to ensure that we
continue this roundabout battle of care and

1634
01:51:23,701 --> 01:51:24,657
delicacy.

1635
01:51:24,657 --> 01:51:25,894
LIAM: Battle of cowards!

1636
01:51:25,894 --> 01:51:27,805
TALIESIN: I am proud of what I've done so far!

1637
01:51:27,805 --> 01:51:29,131
LIAM: Same.

1638
01:51:29,131 --> 01:51:33,368
MARISHA: I would like to say, I feel like I've been
playing pretty aggressively.

1639
01:51:33,368 --> 01:51:39,388
MATT: You have been. You've been doing good. You
and Scanlan both have been doing pretty well.

1640
01:51:39,388 --> 01:51:42,196
Grog's been going door-to-door salesman.

1641
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:44,746
LIAM: I have not lost a single hit point, Matt!

1642
01:51:44,746 --> 01:51:46,017
MATT: You have not!

1643
01:51:46,017 --> 01:51:47,447
TRAVIS: I've been looking for Vax!

1644
01:51:47,447 --> 01:51:51,356
TALIESIN: I've been sniping the way I've always
wanted to. I feel like such a badass right now. I

1645
01:51:51,356 --> 01:51:52,668
know it's going to end.

1646
01:51:52,668 --> 01:51:56,806
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes after a
quick break, guys. At the break, we have our

1647
01:51:56,806 --> 01:52:04,404
Wyrmwood giveaway. The keyword for this one is
"showdown." Put "showdown" in the chat room, one

1648
01:52:04,404 --> 01:52:08,465
word, when you are prompted to be entered and
we'll come back with the winner after the break.

1649
01:52:08,465 --> 01:52:10,522
See you guys here in a few minutes.

1650
01:52:10,522 --> 02:10:40,844
[break]

1651
02:10:40,936 --> 02:10:47,164
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. First off, we have
the winner in the chat for the black poisonwood

1652
02:10:47,164 --> 02:10:51,690
Wyrmwood box, which I didn't have around to show
you at the time, but it's really pretty. The

1653
02:10:51,690 --> 02:10:57,899
winner is CleverNameAlreadyTaken. Congratulations,
CleverNameAlreadyTaken. Danoba will get in contact

1654
02:10:57,899 --> 02:11:01,677
with you and get your shipping information. We'll
get that out to you ASAP. Signed by the cast.

1655
02:11:01,677 --> 02:11:14,241
Thank you again. So let's dive back into this
blood drizzle. You know.

1656
02:11:14,241 --> 02:11:17,111
MARISHA: Waiting for that first blood. Waiting for
it.

1657
02:11:17,111 --> 02:11:21,500
MATT: There's been a lot of first bloods, just no
consistent blood.

1658
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:24,215
LIAM: Guys, the Raven Queen took me out of here 20
minutes ago.

1659
02:11:24,215 --> 02:11:28,913
MATT: You just find his equipment in the middle of
the battlefield.

1660
02:11:28,913 --> 02:11:31,355
MARISHA: Oh, poor timing.

1661
02:11:31,355 --> 02:11:33,538
LIAM: She gave me 20 minutes, she said.

1662
02:11:33,538 --> 02:11:43,505
MATT: Top of the round, Percival. First off, you
heal 20 hit points as your turn begins inside the

1663
02:11:43,505 --> 02:11:50,506
column of green light atop the tower. And it's
your turn.

1664
02:11:50,506 --> 02:11:56,662
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot the lock. I'm going
to get within ten feet of that lock so that

1665
02:11:56,662 --> 02:11:59,711
there's no sound and I'm going to shoot the lock
open.

1666
02:11:59,711 --> 02:12:01,683
MATT: Make an attack roll.

1667
02:12:01,683 --> 02:12:09,995
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Retort for this just
because I don't want to waste anything worthwhile.

1668
02:12:09,995 --> 02:12:13,885
30 to hit.

1669
02:12:13,885 --> 02:12:16,265
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.

1670
02:12:16,265 --> 02:12:20,042
TALIESIN: All right. Where's my fancy--? There we
are. That's ten points of damage.

1671
02:12:20,042 --> 02:12:27,937
MATT: Okay. The lock splinters and the trapdoor
falls open.

1672
02:12:27,937 --> 02:12:36,019
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to run inside and
perch on the ceiling. I'm going to use my Spider

1673
02:12:36,019 --> 02:12:38,001
Climb boots. And what do I see around?

1674
02:12:38,001 --> 02:12:43,962
MATT: Okay, as soon as you rush to the stairs you
can see there's a bit of fog on the inside of the

1675
02:12:43,962 --> 02:12:50,891
chamber. It fills the room and obscures a lot of
the interior. So you move up onto the ceiling and

1676
02:12:50,891 --> 02:12:53,887
you're now underneath, inside the chamber.

1677
02:12:53,887 --> 02:12:55,746
TALIESIN: I don't see anything?

1678
02:12:55,746 --> 02:13:05,155
MATT: You are, for the purposes of this,
upside-down there.

1679
02:13:05,155 --> 02:13:10,264
TALIESIN: Sure. I'm going to hide-- and those
stairs keep going down?

1680
02:13:10,264 --> 02:13:14,737
MATT: They do. You have 15 more movement if you
want.

1681
02:13:14,737 --> 02:13:17,137
TALIESIN: I'm going to go down to the next level.

1682
02:13:17,137 --> 02:13:21,529
MATT: You don't have quite enough movement to get
there. You get just to the top of the stairway

1683
02:13:21,529 --> 02:13:25,075
onto the ceiling. We'll put you there for the sake
of keeping track of it.

1684
02:13:25,075 --> 02:13:28,661
TALIESIN: Can I see down there at all?

1685
02:13:28,661 --> 02:13:31,234
MATT: Yeah, the fog kind of dissipates below.

1686
02:13:31,234 --> 02:13:40,391
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case I'm not going to get
that close if I can't get all the way there

1687
02:13:40,391 --> 02:13:45,980
anyway. So I'm going to get right in that little
corner there and keep an eye out.

1688
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:47,399
MATT: Well, to look down the stairs you'd have to
get--

1689
02:13:47,399 --> 02:13:50,720
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I was going to say, I have to
get to the other side of the fog? I don't have

1690
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,328
enough movement to get back from the fog, then?

1691
02:13:52,328 --> 02:13:55,453
MATT: Well, you're in the fog still but I mean, it
dissipates down the stairs. The whole chamber's

1692
02:13:55,453 --> 02:13:56,664
still filled with fog.

1693
02:13:56,664 --> 02:13:59,217
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to stay in the fog and
keep an eye on what's down there.

1694
02:13:59,217 --> 02:14:07,272
MATT: Okay. Boop. All righty. That ends Percival's
turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1695
02:14:07,272 --> 02:14:09,651
SAM: Bonus action: Healing Word.

1696
02:14:09,651 --> 02:14:11,815
TALIESIN: Wow, you are not rolling those well.

1697
02:14:11,815 --> 02:14:15,737
MATT: You have an air elemental swirling 80 feet
above you.

1698
02:14:15,737 --> 02:14:18,743
SAM: Yep. I just sang a little song to myself.

1699
02:14:18,743 --> 02:14:22,166
TALIESIN: I've softened him up for you.

1700
02:14:22,166 --> 02:14:35,593
SAM: Okay, so for all who care, I'm up to 63. And
I'm going to look at Keyleth, say into my earring,

1701
02:14:35,593 --> 02:14:46,806
Friends, let's go fucking kill Vax. At least find
him! This is not a fair fight without him! And

1702
02:14:46,806 --> 02:14:49,404
then I will Dimension Door to the opposite corner
again.

1703
02:14:49,404 --> 02:14:52,273
MARISHA: Oh, good call!

1704
02:14:52,273 --> 02:14:59,905
MATT: Keyleth, you hear his cry into the earring
and watch as, in a flash of vibrant pink-purple

1705
02:14:59,905 --> 02:15:04,303
energy, he steps through a small, magic-made
doorway and vanishes from your sight.

1706
02:15:04,303 --> 02:15:06,856
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay.

1707
02:15:06,856 --> 02:15:08,588
TRAVIS: Anti-gravity still going?

1708
02:15:08,588 --> 02:15:15,646
SAM: Oh yeah. Whose turn?

1709
02:15:15,646 --> 02:15:24,305
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. That brings us to
Grog. Sorry. Top of the round, now the exterior of

1710
02:15:24,305 --> 02:15:29,584
the tower bursts into flames. Fire climbs up and
incinerates the island around the central tower,

1711
02:15:29,584 --> 02:15:32,340
to no effect currently. Grog, your turn.

1712
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:36,970
TRAVIS: Can I turn around, since my magic pedestal
has not done anything for me, and go through the

1713
02:15:36,970 --> 02:15:38,383
portal, please?

1714
02:15:38,383 --> 02:15:40,704
TALIESIN: Also, by the way, you see Scanlan as
well.

1715
02:15:40,704 --> 02:15:43,601
SAM: Hello! Bye-bye!

1716
02:15:43,601 --> 02:15:48,186
MATT: Ten, 15. You're now inside.

1717
02:15:48,186 --> 02:15:50,956
TRAVIS: Can I keep going straight across?

1718
02:15:50,956 --> 02:15:55,689
MATT: 50. You're about knee-deep in the water.

1719
02:15:55,689 --> 02:16:01,507
TRAVIS: Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to
leap horizontally 20 feet?

1720
02:16:01,507 --> 02:16:03,638
MATT: Go for it. Well, make the athletics check.

1721
02:16:03,638 --> 02:16:08,808
TRAVIS: 17.

1722
02:16:08,808 --> 02:16:16,724
MATT: 17, yeah. You just crest onto the edge. Your
ankle's kind of at the edge of the water. That's it.

1723
02:16:16,724 --> 02:16:25,866
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it. Can I use my dash to go
inside the tower from the bottom door?

1724
02:16:25,866 --> 02:16:27,092
MATT: You may.

1725
02:16:27,092 --> 02:16:28,186
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1726
02:16:28,186 --> 02:16:31,787
SAM: Has he hit the anti-gravity field yet?

1727
02:16:31,787 --> 02:16:41,352
MATT: Just as you get to the edge of that, I need
you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving

1728
02:16:41,352 --> 02:16:42,268
throw.

1729
02:16:42,268 --> 02:16:46,907
TRAVIS: Well, that's my game. Yeah, no. Seven.

1730
02:16:46,907 --> 02:16:50,877
SAM: I didn't know you were even there!

1731
02:16:50,877 --> 02:16:54,435
TRAVIS: I wasn't there. I thought it was put over
on that side of the tower.

1732
02:16:54,435 --> 02:17:03,242
MATT: So Grog, as you go--

1733
02:17:03,242 --> 02:17:10,271
SAM: Unintended consequences. Don't worry, I'll
get rid of it on the next round-- oh wait. You'll

1734
02:17:10,271 --> 02:17:12,118
plummet to your death.

1735
02:17:12,118 --> 02:17:13,670
TALIESIN: Oh no, he'll survive.

1736
02:17:13,670 --> 02:17:15,861
TRAVIS: I can't do much but hit things, so you
know.

1737
02:17:15,861 --> 02:17:25,461
MATT: For the purposes of this here, that puts it
about fair. Grog, you go flying up into the sky,

1738
02:17:25,461 --> 02:17:30,975
past the edge of the tower, slamming into the
ceiling over the battlefield. I need you to make a

1739
02:17:30,975 --> 02:17:32,318
constitution saving throw.

1740
02:17:32,318 --> 02:17:34,889
TRAVIS: Yes. 31.

1741
02:17:34,889 --> 02:17:43,869
MATT: 31, you succeed. So you take what would've
been 21 points of force damage, reduced to ten.

1742
02:17:43,869 --> 02:17:52,117
And you do not bounce off to return-- you manage
to stop yourself, but you're still about to be

1743
02:17:52,117 --> 02:17:58,090
forced back into it. You don't get pushed off, but
the gravity's still pushing you into it. So each

1744
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:03,858
round you're up there, you're going to keep taking
this damage. All righty. That finishes Grog's

1745
02:18:03,858 --> 02:18:07,685
turn. All right. Mr. Stealthy Pants?

1746
02:18:07,685 --> 02:18:10,107
MARISHA: Stealthy Pants McGee.

1747
02:18:10,107 --> 02:18:12,529
SAM: Can you only send him moves in gif form?

1748
02:18:12,529 --> 02:18:19,872
LIAM: How did you know that's what I was doing?
This is that kid in the GoCart chair that spins

1749
02:18:19,872 --> 02:18:21,421
and spins and spins.

1750
02:18:21,421 --> 02:18:24,231
SAM: Sure, sure. I'm going to do a Mr. Bean
followed by a--

1751
02:18:24,231 --> 02:18:26,771
MARISHA: Followed by a Homer Simpson into the
bushes.

1752
02:18:26,771 --> 02:18:37,406
Followed by that kid that's like "Oh
shit!" as he runs by.

1753
02:18:37,406 --> 02:18:44,486
MATT: Here's the thing, and I'm being fair in this
circumstance. Keyleth and Grog, out of the corner

1754
02:18:44,486 --> 02:18:49,945
of your eye, you see a dash of black, winged
movement as, darting from the edge of this tower,

1755
02:18:49,945 --> 02:18:57,774
you see something out the side of this tower, like
climbing on the outside, dart and then vanish in

1756
02:18:57,774 --> 02:18:59,180
that direction.

1757
02:18:59,180 --> 02:19:00,946
TALIESIN: Wow.

1758
02:19:00,946 --> 02:19:03,443
LIAM: You don't know that.

1759
02:19:03,443 --> 02:19:04,635
TALIESIN: I don't know shit.

1760
02:19:04,635 --> 02:19:08,983
MARISHA: How <i>did</i> you get up the tower?

1761
02:19:08,983 --> 02:19:11,423
TRAVIS: He didn't go in the tower. He just climbed
up the side.

1762
02:19:11,423 --> 02:19:18,709
LIAM: Her miniature is facing that way. His
miniature is facing that way. I'm being a shit.

1763
02:19:18,709 --> 02:19:19,830
MATT: You want to fight me on this?

1764
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:28,806
LIAM: Not at all. I started this game knowing that
Marisha was going to kill me. Ooh.

1765
02:19:28,806 --> 02:19:33,288
MATT: Early bird gets an early grave. All righty.
That brings us to--

1766
02:19:33,288 --> 02:19:35,023
MARISHA: I'm trying so hard.

1767
02:19:35,023 --> 02:19:36,331
MATT: Keyleth.

1768
02:19:36,331 --> 02:19:42,687
MARISHA: Okay, so Grog is suspended, being
repeatedly beaten into the ceiling?

1769
02:19:42,687 --> 02:19:46,401
TALIESIN: Vibrated to death.

1770
02:19:46,401 --> 02:19:53,044
MATT: Yeah, right now-- You didn't bounce off but
now you're slammed into it and being slowly pushed

1771
02:19:53,044 --> 02:19:54,775
into it, like (static crackling).

1772
02:19:54,775 --> 02:19:57,912
TRAVIS: Good times.

1773
02:19:57,912 --> 02:20:04,021
MARISHA: And I saw a black streak go this
direction?

1774
02:20:04,021 --> 02:20:07,770
MATT: From this wall to behind where the edge of
this building, and then vanish.

1775
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:13,670
MARISHA: And I know Percy's somewhere in the
tower, but I don't know where?

1776
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:14,768
MATT: Correct.

1777
02:20:14,768 --> 02:20:28,457
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. Let me just try and find
people. I'm going to fly over top of where that is

1778
02:20:28,457 --> 02:20:36,886
and see if I can see anything. I'm going to look
for a stealthy Vax. How much movement was that?

1779
02:20:36,886 --> 02:20:51,929
MATT: That would've been-- oh god. Knocked you
over. Actually, as far as you can get is there.

1780
02:20:51,929 --> 02:20:55,579
MARISHA: Okay. Do I see anything from my awesome
aerial perspective?

1781
02:20:55,579 --> 02:21:00,532
MATT: You do not. There's the open door to the
building and there's the circular thing over there

1782
02:21:00,532 --> 02:21:01,864
but that's all you can see.

1783
02:21:01,864 --> 02:21:03,223
SAM: He could be somewhere over there.

1784
02:21:03,223 --> 02:21:07,918
LIAM and TALIESIN: (singing) Somewhere out there.

1785
02:21:07,918 --> 02:21:12,222
LIAM: I'll fucking shank your ass!

1786
02:21:12,222 --> 02:21:14,233
MATT: Keyleth?

1787
02:21:14,233 --> 02:21:21,831
MARISHA: Can I use the rest of my action to move
down? To just move?

1788
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:23,582
MATT: Where do you want to move?

1789
02:21:23,582 --> 02:21:29,415
MARISHA: Let me drop down 60 feet. Or half my
movement speed or something like that, right?

1790
02:21:29,415 --> 02:21:31,718
MATT: Yeah, so you'd be about, let's say--

1791
02:21:31,718 --> 02:21:38,639
SAM: Matt, could I see her, by the way, when she
flew over and down like that?

1792
02:21:38,639 --> 02:21:46,737
MATT: Yeah, you saw her coast over and downward.
So there you go. That's your turn.

1793
02:21:46,737 --> 02:21:47,842
MARISHA: That's my turn.

1794
02:21:47,842 --> 02:21:49,158
MATT: All right, Percival, you're up.

1795
02:21:49,158 --> 02:21:51,434
TALIESIN: I'm going to go the next level down, see
what I see.

1796
02:21:51,434 --> 02:21:55,861
MATT: Okay. The fog has now begun to dissipate
from the entire chamber.

1797
02:21:55,861 --> 02:22:03,134
LIAM: It's like ten minutes. I'm going to check. I
could be wrong because I don't know shit.

1798
02:22:03,134 --> 02:22:04,762
MATT: You might be right. I was just guessing.

1799
02:22:04,762 --> 02:22:05,765
MARISHA: Did you make fog?

1800
02:22:05,765 --> 02:22:08,965
LIAM: No! Yes.

1801
02:22:08,965 --> 02:22:10,750
TRAVIS: Do you want to tell us anything you did?

1802
02:22:10,750 --> 02:22:11,975
LIAM: I didn't play this game.

1803
02:22:11,975 --> 02:22:15,271
TALIESIN: I'm just heading down, scanning, heading
down, scanning, and looking for anything.

1804
02:22:15,271 --> 02:22:16,491
LIAM: One hour.

1805
02:22:16,491 --> 02:22:19,278
MATT: Oh yeah, then never mind. It dissipates
because you step out of it.

1806
02:22:19,278 --> 02:22:21,251
LIAM: I'm a druid, yo.

1807
02:22:21,251 --> 02:22:23,019
TALIESIN: Fuck, I forgot that.

1808
02:22:23,019 --> 02:22:24,416
MARISHA: Did you do Fog Cloud?

1809
02:22:24,416 --> 02:22:25,649
LIAM: Yeah, baby!

1810
02:22:25,649 --> 02:22:33,429
MATT: Heading down, there's no furniture, just the
stairway. It looks like the interior of this has

1811
02:22:33,429 --> 02:22:39,403
been either unfurnished or cleared out. It's just
a series of empty stairs that lead up and down the

1812
02:22:39,403 --> 02:22:40,380
tower.

1813
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:44,719
TALIESIN: I'm going to get all the way to the
bottom, then, and back myself against that bottom

1814
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:50,505
door and I'm going to push all the way to the
bottom of the tower with my movement.

1815
02:22:50,505 --> 02:22:52,794
MATT: Okay. That's your whole turn?

1816
02:22:52,794 --> 02:22:57,776
TALIESIN: I was hoping there'd be a person in
there. I mean, that's all my movement, isn't it?

1817
02:22:57,865 --> 02:23:03,933
And that's all my action to move that as well,
right? Yep, I ran down that tower going, I want to

1818
02:23:03,933 --> 02:23:05,041
fight everybody!

1819
02:23:05,041 --> 02:23:06,970
LIAM: Good boy. Not metagaming.

1820
02:23:06,970 --> 02:23:11,279
MARISHA: Ooh, the m-word.

1821
02:23:11,279 --> 02:23:14,674
MATT: Finishing Percy's turn, Scanlan.

1822
02:23:14,674 --> 02:23:20,711
SAM: My turn? Jesus Christ, I don't know what to
do. I only see Keyleth. I've only seen Keyleth

1823
02:23:20,711 --> 02:23:24,789
this whole game! Do I see Grog up there, flying?

1824
02:23:24,789 --> 02:23:26,537
MATT: Yeah, you see Grog up there bouncing.

1825
02:23:26,537 --> 02:23:29,187
MARISHA: And Percy shot you!

1826
02:23:29,187 --> 02:23:33,810
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion that, against the
wall, I don't think he sees him right now.

1827
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:35,617
MATT: Right now, no, but if you were to look
around.

1828
02:23:35,617 --> 02:23:38,741
TALIESIN: If you were to back off a bit,
you would see him, maybe.

1829
02:23:38,741 --> 02:23:40,047
SAM: Okay, I will peek around the corner.

1830
02:23:40,047 --> 02:23:44,929
MATT: Okay, so you move five feet, glance over,
and you see Grog currently being jammed up into

1831
02:23:44,929 --> 02:23:46,242
the ceiling.

1832
02:23:46,242 --> 02:23:50,727
SAM: I kind of know where Keyleth is. I kind of
know where Grog is. No one has responded to my

1833
02:23:50,727 --> 02:23:54,046
text message of "Let's go find Vax."

1834
02:23:54,046 --> 02:24:04,538
TALIESIN: Sorry, new earring, who's this? Thank
you for being the only person who really laughed

1835
02:24:04,538 --> 02:24:07,414
at my good joke. That was a very good joke. Chat
probably liked it.

1836
02:24:07,414 --> 02:24:10,825
SAM: Bonus action Healing Word. Oh wait, wrong
one.

1837
02:24:10,825 --> 02:24:17,243
MARISHA: He's going to use all of his spells to
just Healing Word. 1d4 at a time.

1838
02:24:17,243 --> 02:24:18,610
MATT: Just slowly build it back up.

1839
02:24:18,610 --> 02:24:20,926
TALIESIN: And I will take it all away again next
time I see him.

1840
02:24:20,926 --> 02:24:27,016
SAM: Jesus, I don't know what to do. I'm not going
to go after Keyleth without backup.

1841
02:24:27,016 --> 02:24:33,203
MARISHA: No, but here. I'm going after Vax too! Ba
ra ra!

1842
02:24:33,203 --> 02:24:34,537
SAM: You don't speak English!

1843
02:24:34,537 --> 02:24:36,012
MATT: Well, technically she can.

1844
02:24:36,012 --> 02:24:41,943
MARISHA: Oh wait, we decided I can because it's
telepathic. I'm trying to find my boyfriend! He

1845
02:24:41,943 --> 02:24:46,231
fucking ditched me at this bar! Fucking asshole!

1846
02:24:46,231 --> 02:24:53,459
SAM: All right. So I'm going to announce to
everyone, I am going to search for Vax! Hold your

1847
02:24:53,459 --> 02:25:01,372
fire! And I'll walk, I guess, around this thing.
Can I get around it without--?

1848
02:25:01,372 --> 02:25:03,834
MATT: You can get 25 feet.

1849
02:25:03,834 --> 02:25:07,877
SAM: Actually, no, I don't know where he is at
all.

1850
02:25:07,877 --> 02:25:12,462
MATT: You see her floating. After Keyleth tells
you that, she's over here, moving down this way.

1851
02:25:12,462 --> 02:25:13,723
That's all you know.

1852
02:25:13,723 --> 02:25:15,588
LIAM: Baby, are you saving a Wish for me?

1853
02:25:15,588 --> 02:25:17,059
SAM: Yeah.

1854
02:25:17,059 --> 02:25:23,958
MARISHA: Oh, your <i>other</i> boyfriend? Okay.

1855
02:25:23,958 --> 02:25:26,106
LIAM: That's another universe.

1856
02:25:26,106 --> 02:25:28,686
MATT: One's in-game, one's out-of-game.

1857
02:25:28,686 --> 02:25:30,990
MARISHA: Oh sure. Sorry.

1858
02:25:30,990 --> 02:25:32,611
LIAM: One's real, Marisha. One's real.

1859
02:25:32,611 --> 02:25:39,482
SAM: All right. I'm going to start going this
way.

1860
02:25:39,482 --> 02:25:42,468
MATT: You get that far, less than that, even.

1861
02:25:42,468 --> 02:25:46,162
SAM: I'll use dash to keep going.

1862
02:25:46,162 --> 02:25:51,791
MATT: You can get about there. Tiny gnomish legs.

1863
02:25:51,791 --> 02:25:55,192
MARISHA: This is a big-ass map.

1864
02:25:55,192 --> 02:26:00,462
TALIESIN: This is such a big map! I love it! It
makes me very dangerous.

1865
02:26:00,462 --> 02:26:08,379
MATT: Beginning of Grog's turn, you watch the
lightning towers spark and then fire off radius.

1866
02:26:08,379 --> 02:26:10,522
Nobody's there. Grog, you're up.

1867
02:26:10,522 --> 02:26:12,248
SAM: Really, no one's near the lightning towers?

1868
02:26:12,248 --> 02:26:15,588
TRAVIS: Getting bug zapped.

1869
02:26:15,588 --> 02:26:17,548
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw,
please.

1870
02:26:17,548 --> 02:26:22,895
TRAVIS: Big southern mosquito. 30! 18 plus 12.

1871
02:26:22,895 --> 02:26:26,723
MATT: You succeed. So you take 12 points of force
damage.

1872
02:26:26,723 --> 02:26:29,974
TRAVIS: Dear god. That's already halved, right?

1873
02:26:29,974 --> 02:26:30,996
MATT: Yes.

1874
02:26:30,996 --> 02:26:32,442
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

1875
02:26:32,442 --> 02:26:37,255
SAM: I guess I could have dropped Anti-Gravity. I
forgot.

1876
02:26:37,255 --> 02:26:45,552
TRAVIS: You did? Cool. With my bonus action, can I
use my Second Wind to heal 1d10 plus my stupid-ass

1877
02:26:45,656 --> 02:26:46,617
fighter level?

1878
02:26:46,703 --> 02:26:47,751
MATT: Go for it.

1879
02:26:47,751 --> 02:26:51,956
SAM: You want me to get rid of it?

1880
02:26:51,956 --> 02:26:56,048
TRAVIS: I'm fucking up here until you don't!

1881
02:26:56,048 --> 02:27:01,247
SAM: I forgot, I'm sorry! Can I do it now, Matt?
No.

1882
02:27:01,247 --> 02:27:03,120
TRAVIS: It's cool, I'm up there.

1883
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,896
SAM: It's fine.

1884
02:27:04,896 --> 02:27:13,340
TRAVIS: I'm going to get the immovable rod out in
my hand, waiting to fall.

1885
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:19,054
MATT: You've got the immovable rod out and you're
clutching it. So you're holding your action on it?

1886
02:27:19,054 --> 02:27:27,666
TRAVIS: I'll hold my action if someone comes
within striking range. Can I say that?

1887
02:27:27,666 --> 02:27:31,872
MATT: Are you holding your attack or--

1888
02:27:31,872 --> 02:27:36,911
TRAVIS: An action, not an attack. My action so I
can click the rod.

1889
02:27:36,911 --> 02:27:43,927
LIAM: I sent a question, and here comes a second
question. Here it comes.

1890
02:27:43,927 --> 02:27:46,294
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

1891
02:27:46,294 --> 02:27:48,636
TALIESIN: Sorry, my fault. Hi.

1892
02:27:48,636 --> 02:28:03,743
LIAM: Got it. Okay. I'm good. So you know what I
want to do. I did it already.

1893
02:28:03,743 --> 02:28:05,679
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

1894
02:28:05,679 --> 02:28:10,780
LIAM: Hey man, I worked really hard for 115
episodes. Allow me to be a fuckoff.

1895
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:14,928
MARISHA: I'm going to look around. No sign of Vax,
I'm assuming.

1896
02:28:14,928 --> 02:28:16,146
MATT: From where you currently stand, no.

1897
02:28:16,146 --> 02:28:26,546
MARISHA: Scanlan, he's too fucking stealthy! I'm
going to go punk Grog. And then I'm going to fly

1898
02:28:26,546 --> 02:28:30,007
up within 60 feet of him.

1899
02:28:30,007 --> 02:28:31,994
SAM: You just gave up?

1900
02:28:31,994 --> 02:28:34,598
MARISHA: I can't find him! I looked!

1901
02:28:34,598 --> 02:28:37,110
SAM: For legitimately six seconds.

1902
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:41,437
TRAVIS: I'm literally the helium balloon in the
grocery store that broke away from the cashier and

1903
02:28:41,437 --> 02:28:43,065
is fucking sitting up there.

1904
02:28:43,065 --> 02:28:44,739
TALIESIN: You're going on an adventure!

1905
02:28:44,739 --> 02:28:47,688
MARISHA: He's not going to let me do another
perception check! I tried!

1906
02:28:47,688 --> 02:28:49,757
LIAM: It's the best! Until I die.

1907
02:28:49,757 --> 02:28:59,188
MARISHA: I'm going to go up and be like: Sorry,
Grog! And hit him with a Blight spell. Let's say

1908
02:28:59,188 --> 02:29:00,237
level--

1909
02:29:00,237 --> 02:29:01,897
LIAM: That's going to shoot off your pinky toe,
man!

1910
02:29:01,897 --> 02:29:03,512
TRAVIS: I've got another one of those.

1911
02:29:03,512 --> 02:29:06,541
MARISHA: Let's say a level five Blight.

1912
02:29:06,541 --> 02:29:09,996
MATT: Grog, make a constitution saving throw,
please.

1913
02:29:09,996 --> 02:29:13,676
LIAM: Man, next campaign you're not going to be a
meat sponge like this.

1914
02:29:13,676 --> 02:29:15,146
TRAVIS: I won't be. 18.

1915
02:29:15,146 --> 02:29:18,465
MATT: 18, that's a failure. So full damage of
Blight on Grog.

1916
02:29:18,465 --> 02:29:22,462
TRAVIS: Whatever it is, I'll use my Stone's
Endurance.

1917
02:29:22,462 --> 02:29:26,932
LIAM: God, when you play your aasimar ranger, it's
going to be so weird.

1918
02:29:26,932 --> 02:29:33,696
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't know what that first word
you said is. Aasimar?

1919
02:29:33,696 --> 02:29:38,282
LIAM: Your kenku druid.

1920
02:29:38,282 --> 02:29:41,181
TRAVIS: My tabaxi tortle.

1921
02:29:41,181 --> 02:29:45,553
LIAM: Tabaxi tortle half-breed bard. Yeah.

1922
02:29:45,553 --> 02:29:48,540
MATT: I multi-raced a little since I leveled up.

1923
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:51,595
LIAM: Tabaxi with a shell.

1924
02:29:51,595 --> 02:29:54,123
MATT: Someone please draw that.

1925
02:29:54,123 --> 02:30:03,504
MARISHA: 49 points of necrotic damage.

1926
02:30:03,504 --> 02:30:16,290
TRAVIS: Let me roll my Stone's Endurance. Ten plus
my constitution. Minus 16. So 41 minus 16 would be

1927
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:20,127
25.

1928
02:30:20,127 --> 02:30:22,673
MARISHA: Where'd that minus 16 go?

1929
02:30:22,673 --> 02:30:24,266
TRAVIS: My Stone's Endurance.

1930
02:30:24,266 --> 02:30:25,742
MATT: Wait, how much damage was it?

1931
02:30:25,742 --> 02:30:27,295
MARISHA: 49.

1932
02:30:27,295 --> 02:30:32,410
MATT: Oh, 49. Sorry, minus 16. So it'd be 33.

1933
02:30:32,410 --> 02:30:34,961
MARISHA: 42 plus seven is 49, right?

1934
02:30:34,961 --> 02:30:45,225
MATT: Keyleth, he screams out in pain as he's
being pushed into the ceiling. His veins bulge

1935
02:30:45,225 --> 02:30:47,743
with black energy as the Blight takes hold.

1936
02:30:47,743 --> 02:30:48,968
TRAVIS: Not cool!

1937
02:30:48,968 --> 02:30:51,440
MARISHA: Sorry!

1938
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:52,872
TRAVIS: No, you're not.

1939
02:30:52,872 --> 02:30:57,440
MATT: You're about 50 feet of movement left.

1940
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:08,065
MARISHA: Next is the blue, so let me go to that
back corner a bit more. That's good.

1941
02:31:08,065 --> 02:31:12,516
MATT: There you are. Ending Keyleth's turn, Percy,
you're up.

1942
02:31:12,516 --> 02:31:28,238
TALIESIN: I'm going to exit out the door and I'm
going to take a run back over here. This way.

1943
02:31:28,238 --> 02:31:32,114
(counting)

1944
02:31:32,114 --> 02:31:34,761
MATT: 30, if you wanted to get there.

1945
02:31:34,761 --> 02:31:36,692
SAM: Are you jumping across the river?

1946
02:31:36,692 --> 02:31:40,430
TALIESIN: I don't even know if I'm actually
jumping?

1947
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:46,354
SAM: Does he have to leave the ground to jump
across?

1948
02:31:46,354 --> 02:31:48,213
TALIESIN: I was actually going to walk, to be
fair.

1949
02:31:48,213 --> 02:31:51,672
MARISHA and TALIESIN: I see what you're doing.

1950
02:31:51,672 --> 02:31:54,509
TALIESIN: Am I in the range of it at that point?

1951
02:31:54,509 --> 02:31:56,612
MATT: I don't know, are you?

1952
02:31:56,612 --> 02:31:58,478
TALIESIN: Where's the--?

1953
02:31:58,478 --> 02:32:00,968
MATT: You don't know. You didn't see.

1954
02:32:00,968 --> 02:32:05,808
TALIESIN: I was planning on walking, but I'm fine
either way. If you make a roll for it, I'll make a

1955
02:32:05,808 --> 02:32:06,987
dex roll.

1956
02:32:06,987 --> 02:32:08,482
MATT: Make a dex roll.

1957
02:32:08,482 --> 02:32:17,300
TALIESIN: It's a dex save? All right. 19?

1958
02:32:17,300 --> 02:32:18,852
MATT: No.

1959
02:32:18,852 --> 02:32:21,488
TALIESIN: Was it not? Just for fun, let's burn--

1960
02:32:21,488 --> 02:32:23,051
MATT: Indomitable?

1961
02:32:23,051 --> 02:32:26,871
TALIESIN: Let's burn a resolve.

1962
02:32:26,871 --> 02:32:28,961
MATT: Indomitable you mean, right?

1963
02:32:28,961 --> 02:32:32,301
TALIESIN: It's reroll a save?

1964
02:32:32,301 --> 02:32:33,515
MATT: Yeah.

1965
02:32:33,515 --> 02:32:41,876
TALIESIN: I wrote it down weirdly because I was
trying to conserve space. Yeah, no.

1966
02:32:41,876 --> 02:32:44,511
TRAVIS: I have a playmate!

1967
02:32:44,511 --> 02:33:04,024
MATT: Percival, you go firing up into the ceiling
as you attempt to make your way across the river.

1968
02:33:04,024 --> 02:33:12,251
Technically, you're one higher than that, but
that's fine. Make a constitution saving throw as

1969
02:33:12,251 --> 02:33:13,843
you get thrust up.

1970
02:33:13,843 --> 02:33:23,745
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. (counting)
24.

1971
02:33:23,745 --> 02:33:35,812
MATT: That's a success. You suffer 21 halved to
ten points of force damage. You and Grog are now

1972
02:33:35,812 --> 02:33:39,961
within visual range of each other, being pushed
into the force field ceiling.

1973
02:33:39,961 --> 02:33:45,746
TALIESIN: I still have my action. There's no way I
can use spider climb on the force wall, is there?

1974
02:33:45,746 --> 02:33:48,047
MATT: You can certainly try.

1975
02:33:48,047 --> 02:33:50,049
TALIESIN: Oh, I have to roll concentration.

1976
02:33:50,049 --> 02:33:51,507
MATT: You do.

1977
02:33:51,507 --> 02:33:53,122
SAM: For what?

1978
02:33:53,122 --> 02:33:56,621
TALIESIN: The silence spell. What is that?

1979
02:33:56,621 --> 02:34:00,085
MATT: That's a constitution saving throw.

1980
02:34:00,085 --> 02:34:02,753
TALIESIN: Okay, same thing. 16?

1981
02:34:02,753 --> 02:34:05,931
MATT: 16 succeeds. It's a DC ten.

1982
02:34:05,931 --> 02:34:15,918
TALIESIN: This is interesting.

1983
02:34:15,918 --> 02:34:18,347
MATT: It is. What are you going to do?

1984
02:34:18,347 --> 02:34:20,191
SAM: We're all flying now.

1985
02:34:20,191 --> 02:34:29,056
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and right myself and see
if I can put my boots on and walk on the ceiling.

1986
02:34:29,056 --> 02:34:38,228
MATT: As your feet touch the surface, they find
some purchase. It's like walking on a water bed.

1987
02:34:38,228 --> 02:34:45,351
They seem to be holding somewhat, but that's the
full of your movement.

1988
02:34:45,351 --> 02:34:49,240
TRAVIS: That's fascinating. Those boots are
ridiculous.

1989
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,710
SAM: Water bed.

1990
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:52,422
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1991
02:34:52,422 --> 02:34:55,217
MARISHA: Remember when there were water beds? Good
times.

1992
02:34:55,217 --> 02:34:56,690
TALIESIN: Those were such a pain in the ass.

1993
02:34:56,690 --> 02:34:58,098
MARISHA: Terrible for your back.

1994
02:34:58,098 --> 02:34:59,712
MATT: Scanlan, it's your turn.

1995
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:12,929
SAM: I'm still walking across this room as fast as
my little feets can carry me. And I'm kind of out

1996
02:35:12,929 --> 02:35:15,376
of low-level spells at this point.

1997
02:35:15,376 --> 02:35:18,380
MATT: You can cast it at a higher level, it
just--

1998
02:35:18,380 --> 02:35:21,024
SAM: But it won't be a bonus action anymore, will
it?

1999
02:35:21,024 --> 02:35:22,637
MARISHA: 9th-level Healing Word. Do it.

2000
02:35:22,637 --> 02:35:26,250
SAM: Can I do a bonus action at a higher level if
I don't do a spell for my action?

2001
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:30,038
MATT: You could sacrifice a higher-level spell
slot to cast a level two Healing Word as a bonus

2002
02:35:30,038 --> 02:35:31,174
action.

2003
02:35:31,174 --> 02:35:33,944
SAM: Ugh. Wow.

2004
02:35:33,944 --> 02:35:36,813
MATT: But you'd lose a higher-level spell slot
with only getting the bonuses of a level two

2005
02:35:36,813 --> 02:35:39,999
spell. That I'll allow.

2006
02:35:39,999 --> 02:35:49,864
SAM: That is insane. I will not do that yet. No,
I'll do that. I'm so down. Okay. Oh yeah.

2007
02:35:49,864 --> 02:35:51,379
MATT: What level do you use?

2008
02:35:51,379 --> 02:35:57,048
SAM: Level three. So that heals me another 12
points. Yeah man.

2009
02:35:57,048 --> 02:36:00,681
MATT: So that's your turn?

2010
02:36:00,681 --> 02:36:07,666
SAM: That's my bonus action. Then I'll use my
action to sneak out and look-- Oh wait! I can get

2011
02:36:07,666 --> 02:36:13,704
out and around back here, right? I'll do that. And
when I get out the door I'm looking around. What

2012
02:36:13,704 --> 02:36:15,995
do I see? I see everybody floating in the air?
This is crazy.

2013
02:36:15,995 --> 02:36:21,526
MATT: You see Keyleth over here. Both Grog and
Percival being held against the forcefield.

2014
02:36:21,526 --> 02:36:26,445
Percival seems to have righted himself and his
feet are actually affixed to the field and now is

2015
02:36:26,445 --> 02:36:29,271
walking, trying to move across it.

2016
02:36:29,271 --> 02:36:36,120
SAM: Do I let them go? I need help finding Vax,
but I don't even know if they're on my side right

2017
02:36:36,120 --> 02:36:37,856
now! They haven't responded to my text!

2018
02:36:37,856 --> 02:36:39,592
TRAVIS: We're on your side! Let me down!

2019
02:36:39,592 --> 02:36:41,972
SAM: Okay, then I'm going to release the gravity.

2020
02:36:41,972 --> 02:36:47,813
MATT: Okay. And with that, the gravity subsides.

2021
02:36:47,813 --> 02:36:50,157
TALIESIN: Do I fall?

2022
02:36:50,157 --> 02:36:59,634
MATT: No, you are held aloft. Grog, however,
plummets to the ground for 80 feet.

2023
02:36:59,634 --> 02:37:04,184
TRAVIS: Do I get to use the action to hit the
button on the rod somewhere?

2024
02:37:04,184 --> 02:37:09,485
MATT: As a reaction, you do. Where do you hit the
rod? At what height?

2025
02:37:09,485 --> 02:37:11,873
TRAVIS: I'll hit it at 20 feet above the ground.

2026
02:37:11,873 --> 02:37:13,248
MATT: 20 feet above the ground.

2027
02:37:13,248 --> 02:37:17,011
TRAVIS: Making that Halo dive.

2028
02:37:17,011 --> 02:37:25,527
MATT: Grog, make a strength check. I'm working on
it. Don't worry.

2029
02:37:25,527 --> 02:37:31,188
TRAVIS: 27.

2030
02:37:31,188 --> 02:37:36,613
MATT: 27, yeah. You manage to hold tight. Your
muscles strain from the falling impact of catching

2031
02:37:36,613 --> 02:37:37,842
yourself there.

2032
02:37:37,842 --> 02:37:39,747
LIAM: Does he immediately start doing one-arm
pushups?

2033
02:37:39,747 --> 02:37:46,303
MATT: Essentially, yeah. You suffer one point of
damage. Rolled a one on that one. From just muscle

2034
02:37:46,303 --> 02:37:47,594
strain.

2035
02:37:47,594 --> 02:37:49,937
TRAVIS: But the muscle's going to get that much
bigger.

2036
02:37:49,937 --> 02:37:55,505
MATT: No, it is. The muscle kind of pops out of
the socket and you wrench it back in with the

2037
02:37:55,505 --> 02:37:57,644
sheer force of your shoulder and back muscles.

2038
02:37:57,644 --> 02:37:59,155
LIAM: Micro-tears!

2039
02:37:59,155 --> 02:38:07,941
MATT: All right, Scanlan. That's your turn? All
right. That brings us to Grog. First and foremost,

2040
02:38:07,941 --> 02:38:15,919
you watch as the rooms flash with purple energy.
The water lights up for a second, suffused with

2041
02:38:15,919 --> 02:38:21,934
some sort of magical flash and then comes back to
rest. Grog, it's your turn.

2042
02:38:21,934 --> 02:38:31,104
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm singing. I would like
to un-click the rod, actually. Yeah.

2043
02:38:31,104 --> 02:38:39,530
MATT: Okay. You fall to the ground, taking eight
points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to four.

2044
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:40,881
SAM: That's first blood.

2045
02:38:40,881 --> 02:38:45,418
(laughter)

2046
02:38:45,418 --> 02:38:56,617
TRAVIS: All right. Can I run around over here? Do
I see fucking anything?

2047
02:38:56,617 --> 02:39:01,697
MATT: You see Keyleth up there. That's it.
Percival, you know, is up there.

2048
02:39:01,697 --> 02:39:12,390
TRAVIS: Both totally within range. Is there a door
over there that I can't see? Is there a door over

2049
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:13,554
on this side?

2050
02:39:13,554 --> 02:39:17,635
MATT: On this side, the tower? Yeah, there's an
opening on each side, or each corner, yeah.

2051
02:39:17,635 --> 02:39:19,745
TRAVIS: Can I get to the door from where I am?

2052
02:39:19,745 --> 02:39:21,075
MATT: You can.

2053
02:39:21,075 --> 02:39:22,927
TRAVIS: Can I go inside?

2054
02:39:22,927 --> 02:39:25,047
MATT: You go inside? All right.

2055
02:39:25,047 --> 02:39:27,390
MARISHA: I'm so stealthy, I've lost myself.

2056
02:39:27,390 --> 02:39:34,306
MATT: So that's your action? So you get inside
there. You are now at the center of the tower.

2057
02:39:34,306 --> 02:39:38,070
I'll put you down there just because you're big
for the tower size.

2058
02:39:38,070 --> 02:39:43,123
MARISHA: Going assassin this time. Or thief? You
were assassin last time.

2059
02:39:43,123 --> 02:39:46,576
MATT: All right, ending Grog's turn. Vax.

2060
02:39:46,576 --> 02:39:48,334
LIAM: Troll text, coming your way!

2061
02:39:48,334 --> 02:39:52,106
MARISHA: Goddamn it. You are the literal worst.

2062
02:39:52,106 --> 02:40:00,011
LIAM: I know. Damn it, went to fix a typo I sent
to him and it just did it again. It said "basted"

2063
02:40:00,011 --> 02:40:01,951
instead of "hasted."

2064
02:40:01,951 --> 02:40:05,744
MATT: Technically you can't do that.

2065
02:40:05,744 --> 02:40:09,006
LIAM: Oh, okay. So then--

2066
02:40:09,006 --> 02:40:16,902
MATT: Not as that type of action.

2067
02:40:16,902 --> 02:40:21,464
SAM: He's sending you a gif right now of Dramatic
Chipmunk.

2068
02:40:21,464 --> 02:40:30,970
TALIESIN: That was well done, Grog. I'll tell you
later, but I had plans and you foiled a chunk of

2069
02:40:30,970 --> 02:40:32,227
them.

2070
02:40:32,227 --> 02:40:38,869
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. There's not a lot I can do. I'm
just chasing a bunch of people I can't see.

2071
02:40:38,869 --> 02:40:42,095
LIAM: I can do that. Sure!

2072
02:40:42,095 --> 02:40:43,321
MATT: So you're not doing the first thing?

2073
02:40:43,321 --> 02:40:44,610
LIAM: No, you said I couldn't do the first thing.

2074
02:40:44,610 --> 02:40:46,104
MATT: Not as a hasted action.

2075
02:40:46,104 --> 02:40:49,110
LIAM: Fuck, man.

2076
02:40:49,110 --> 02:40:52,271
TRAVIS: Oh, for the love of god.

2077
02:40:52,271 --> 02:40:57,879
LIAM: Okay, can I reverse that? I can reverse
that, right? If you go back to the first thing?

2078
02:40:57,879 --> 02:40:59,482
MATT: You can't hold a hasted action.

2079
02:40:59,482 --> 02:41:03,153
LIAM: Sure, but I have a regular action, right? So
I'll do it on the regular action.

2080
02:41:03,153 --> 02:41:05,360
MATT: Okay. The first thing you said?

2081
02:41:05,360 --> 02:41:06,908
LIAM: Yes, the first thing I said.

2082
02:41:06,908 --> 02:41:14,951
MATT: Okay. Scanlan, Keyleth. You watch as this
chamber over here, billowing fog emerges from this

2083
02:41:14,951 --> 02:41:21,828
chamber over here. The entire outside of this room
is now completely surrounded in fog.

2084
02:41:21,828 --> 02:41:23,606
SAM: We've got a rogue.

2085
02:41:23,606 --> 02:41:28,728
LIAM: Right, sorry. Yep. Good, but, yep. I'm
good.

2086
02:41:28,728 --> 02:41:31,562
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you just say?!

2087
02:41:31,562 --> 02:41:39,691
LIAM: On a hasted action, I can only attack. I
can't cast spells, which is what I suggested. But

2088
02:41:39,691 --> 02:41:42,710
if I just flip what I do where, I should be
relatively okay.

2089
02:41:42,710 --> 02:41:44,419
MATT: Yeah, but you can't hold a hasted action.

2090
02:41:44,419 --> 02:41:47,713
LIAM: Then I'll do the second thing.

2091
02:41:47,713 --> 02:41:50,495
MATT: That fog cloud's out.

2092
02:41:50,495 --> 02:41:56,143
LIAM: I understand, because that's not part of the
second thing.

2093
02:41:56,143 --> 02:41:58,041
MARISHA: So wait, is the fog cloud there or no?

2094
02:41:58,041 --> 02:41:59,879
MATT: The fog cloud's there.

2095
02:41:59,879 --> 02:42:07,085
LIAM: What am I supposed to do? Announce every
move to you guys while I'm hidden? It defeats the

2096
02:42:07,085 --> 02:42:08,273
purpose!

2097
02:42:08,273 --> 02:42:10,934
TALIESIN: If I tell you what I'm playing next game
will you just stop this?

2098
02:42:10,934 --> 02:42:12,533
LIAM: Dick, dick, dick!

2099
02:42:12,533 --> 02:42:18,785
MATT: Keyleth, it's your turn. You just watched
this fog billow out from the open doorway and

2100
02:42:18,785 --> 02:42:20,235
surround--

2101
02:42:20,235 --> 02:42:21,461
LIAM: I thought you said it was out?

2102
02:42:21,461 --> 02:42:24,621
MARISHA: No, he means it is literally out.

2103
02:42:24,621 --> 02:42:26,031
LIAM: Oh, out the door?

2104
02:42:26,031 --> 02:42:27,087
SAM: There's no door!

2105
02:42:27,087 --> 02:42:28,040
MATT: The door is open.

2106
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:29,052
TALIESIN: The door got exploded.

2107
02:42:29,052 --> 02:42:34,526
MATT: Yeah, the door is shattered by Grog, so you
went in the chamber and fog cloud fills and

2108
02:42:34,526 --> 02:42:36,994
encompasses the surrounding area.

2109
02:42:36,994 --> 02:42:39,196
TRAVIS: I should go check that out.

2110
02:42:39,196 --> 02:42:46,917
MARISHA: I'm going to hover over--

2111
02:42:46,999 --> 02:42:48,855
LIAM: It's fine, it's fine.

2112
02:42:48,855 --> 02:43:01,887
MARISHA: First smoke. Where there's smoke, there
must be a Vax, so I'm going to hover over a little bit.

2113
02:43:01,887 --> 02:43:03,677
MATT: Okay, how far over?

2114
02:43:03,677 --> 02:43:12,054
MARISHA: Move me up 30 feet or so. Or 60 feet.
That's good.

2115
02:43:12,054 --> 02:43:13,610
MATT: That's 50 feet there.

2116
02:43:13,610 --> 02:43:20,742
MARISHA: And then I'm going to be like, Hey boo, I
recognize that spell. That's some druid shit! And

2117
02:43:20,742 --> 02:43:27,360
then I'm going to light up the entire area with a
Fire Storm.

2118
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:36,632
MATT: Okay. All around it.

2119
02:43:36,632 --> 02:43:38,379
MARISHA: Radiating outward. Ten of them.

2120
02:43:38,379 --> 02:43:41,537
MATT: So you hear this and time slows for a
second. Over the earring. As you hear this small

2121
02:43:41,537 --> 02:43:46,548
whine, this (high-pitched whine) (explosion) And
it's nothing but bright light and flames around

2122
02:43:46,548 --> 02:43:53,085
you. It completely engulfs the chamber you're in
and around it. You guys watch and, I'll say this,

2123
02:43:53,085 --> 02:43:57,509
I'm going to say it burns off the fog cloud.

2124
02:43:57,509 --> 02:44:01,716
LIAM: So she did it inside the building?

2125
02:44:01,716 --> 02:44:05,966
MATT: Inside the building, all around it. So I
need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving

2126
02:44:05,966 --> 02:44:07,089
throw.

2127
02:44:07,089 --> 02:44:08,483
LIAM: I'm not worried. Hold on, say that again?

2128
02:44:08,483 --> 02:44:09,689
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

2129
02:44:09,689 --> 02:44:15,912
LIAM: Yeah, that's right. I'm going to use my
second Luck of the day. Oh, that's good. That's

2130
02:44:15,912 --> 02:44:18,975
real good. That's a 29.

2131
02:44:18,975 --> 02:44:27,082
MATT: All right. You've managed to dive behind
where the chest was open from Grog earlier, jump

2132
02:44:27,082 --> 02:44:32,192
into the chest, and slam it closed, just as the
flames engulf the interior, burning the outside

2133
02:44:32,192 --> 02:44:38,396
of the-- He's a little man. As it burns the
exterior of the chest, you manage to avoid all

2134
02:44:38,396 --> 02:44:39,644
damage from the spell.

2135
02:44:39,644 --> 02:44:40,917
SAM: Is it a refrigerator?

2136
02:44:40,917 --> 02:44:41,710
MARISHA: All damage?

2137
02:44:41,710 --> 02:44:46,119
MATT: He has evasion as a rogue. If he succeeds a
dexterity saving throw, he takes no damage.

2138
02:44:46,119 --> 02:44:48,671
TRAVIS: I love how cocky he is when he's like, I'm
going to die!

2139
02:44:48,671 --> 02:44:55,516
LIAM: I am going to die! It's just, later. You
three don't know shit.

2140
02:44:55,516 --> 02:44:58,069
TALIESIN: Actually, I saw that.

2141
02:44:58,069 --> 02:45:04,157
MATT: Yep. As the firestorm dissipates, that chest
is destroyed. You kick off the smoking bits of it.

2142
02:45:04,157 --> 02:45:08,169
MARISHA: At least I've taken out all y'all's
health potions. That was part of the goal.

2143
02:45:08,169 --> 02:45:11,114
MATT: Keyleth, you're going to stay where you
are?

2144
02:45:11,114 --> 02:45:18,989
MARISHA: I'll back up a little bit. Trying to stay
away from Scanlan. Wait, what's your range?

2145
02:45:18,989 --> 02:45:25,612
TALIESIN: My range is there is no getting away
from me. I have a minimum range of 400 feet. There

2146
02:45:25,612 --> 02:45:27,467
is nowhere to hide.

2147
02:45:27,467 --> 02:45:37,362
MARISHA: If I drop down behind the tower, could I
not be seen by Percy? Fly across this way?

2148
02:45:37,362 --> 02:45:39,880
TALIESIN: My shitty gun has a 400-foot range.

2149
02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:41,599
SAM: But it can't go through stone.

2150
02:45:41,599 --> 02:45:45,971
TALIESIN: No, it can't. Yet. I will make ghost
bullets one day.

2151
02:45:45,971 --> 02:45:53,020
TRAVIS: I would try to run up and grapple you or
throw something at you, but you're made of fucking

2152
02:45:53,020 --> 02:45:54,211
wind.

2153
02:45:54,211 --> 02:45:56,198
MARISHA: That's your only evasion that you have,
right?

2154
02:45:56,198 --> 02:45:58,243
LIAM: No, man, that's unlimited.

2155
02:45:58,243 --> 02:46:02,846
MATT: Keyleth, with the rest of your movement and
descending, actually you'd probably get about

2156
02:46:02,846 --> 02:46:03,902
there.

2157
02:46:03,902 --> 02:46:07,417
MARISHA: Until you get hit? You can keep doing
that until-- Wait, but I thought you have one that

2158
02:46:07,417 --> 02:46:09,783
gives you half damage and one that's all damage?

2159
02:46:09,783 --> 02:46:14,198
LIAM: I'm not telling you anything about my rules. You
can figure it out.

2160
02:46:14,198 --> 02:46:18,265
MATT: As you've seen Vax through the entirety of
your gameplay, you'd know that if he has to make a

2161
02:46:18,265 --> 02:46:23,211
dexterity saving throw, if he fails, he takes half
damage. If he succeeds, he takes none. Or he can

2162
02:46:23,211 --> 02:46:25,471
use his reaction to take half damage from a
melee.

2163
02:46:25,471 --> 02:46:26,734
MARISHA: A reaction?

2164
02:46:26,734 --> 02:46:30,469
LIAM: Since your husband told you, reaction is if
you try to hit me with a sword, and I can only do

2165
02:46:30,469 --> 02:46:31,614
that once per round.

2166
02:46:31,614 --> 02:46:32,642
MATT: Or any attack.

2167
02:46:32,642 --> 02:46:33,772
LIAM: Right, melee attack.

2168
02:46:33,772 --> 02:46:35,278
MATT: Oh, yeah, from any melee.

2169
02:46:35,278 --> 02:46:43,675
LIAM: Evasion is just dexterity saves. So use that
information. You can use that information,

2170
02:46:43,675 --> 02:46:44,782
Marisha.

2171
02:46:44,782 --> 02:46:48,474
TALIESIN: You know what doesn't take a dexterity
save? Sending to another dimension.

2172
02:46:48,474 --> 02:46:53,964
LIAM: Dimensions, Finger of Death. I mean it's
inevitable. You're going to kill me eventually.

2173
02:46:53,964 --> 02:46:56,344
It's true!

2174
02:46:56,344 --> 02:47:01,389
MATT: Level 20 rogue. Playing this for five years.
Still don't know how Uncanny Dodge works. "When an

2175
02:47:01,389 --> 02:47:07,782
"attacker you can see hits you with an attack." As
long as you can see them, you can reduce it by

2176
02:47:07,782 --> 02:47:08,770
half.

2177
02:47:08,770 --> 02:47:12,140
LIAM: I never claimed to memorize this book,
people. Next campaign, I'm going to fuck it up

2178
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:14,149
just as much. If that bothers you--

2179
02:47:14,149 --> 02:47:17,750
MATT: That was the other ability. Evasion is the
one that he used. Yeah, evasion's every time.

2180
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:23,518
You're good. All right, so that finishes Keyleth's
turn. You managed to dodge out of Percival's view.

2181
02:47:23,518 --> 02:47:26,982
Percy, you're up. Top of the round I need you to
make a constitution saving throw, because even

2182
02:47:26,982 --> 02:47:29,982
though you're standing on the ceiling, you're
still against the force.

2183
02:47:29,982 --> 02:47:37,253
TALIESIN: That's fine. Constitution saving throw,
let's do this. I've got a plan. I'm going to use

2184
02:47:37,253 --> 02:47:45,353
my second resolve, or my second thing,
Indomitable. Let's hope that's better. That's way

2185
02:47:45,353 --> 02:47:46,627
better, 19.

2186
02:47:46,627 --> 02:47:51,340
MATT: 19 will succeed, yeah, because it's an 18.
All right, so.

2187
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:56,027
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to try and do
something stupid.

2188
02:47:56,027 --> 02:48:03,347
MATT: All right, so you suffer the 11 points of
force damage, reduced to five. Five points of

2189
02:48:03,347 --> 02:48:07,752
force damage and you are not jettisoned off the
force field. So it's considered rough terrain for

2190
02:48:07,752 --> 02:48:09,046
you to move across.

2191
02:48:09,046 --> 02:48:19,822
TALIESIN: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going
to use 25 points of my movement to run.

2192
02:48:19,822 --> 02:48:21,523
MATT: Okay, it's rough terrain, so--

2193
02:48:21,523 --> 02:48:26,914
TALIESIN: Oh. I'm going to use my movement to run
15 feet.

2194
02:48:26,914 --> 02:48:30,051
MATT: 15, you're just--

2195
02:48:30,051 --> 02:48:32,533
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and take a running jump
to the top of the tower.

2196
02:48:32,533 --> 02:48:38,452
MATT: Okay, so you're going to leap and release
the boots? Make an acrobatics check, please. As

2197
02:48:38,452 --> 02:48:42,180
you go and try and leap for it--

2198
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:47,715
TALIESIN: All right, acrobatics check. Come on,
baby. That's 23.

2199
02:48:47,715 --> 02:48:55,097
MATT: 23? All right, so you reduce the damage you
take from the leap.

2200
02:48:55,097 --> 02:48:57,823
TALIESIN: That's a much better fall than I was
going to get.

2201
02:48:57,823 --> 02:49:08,041
MATT: It would've been 18 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to nine. Nine points of

2202
02:49:08,041 --> 02:49:09,161
bludgeoning damage.

2203
02:49:09,161 --> 02:49:13,436
TALIESIN: And then I have to do another
constitution saving throw for the silence spell?

2204
02:49:13,436 --> 02:49:18,146
MATT: Correct. Well, first from the-- You have to
make it twice.

2205
02:49:18,146 --> 02:49:20,090
TALIESIN: Oh. 23.

2206
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:22,635
MATT: And another one for the impact. One was for
the force field and one was for the fall.

2207
02:49:22,635 --> 02:49:24,729
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2208
02:49:24,729 --> 02:49:25,952
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2209
02:49:25,952 --> 02:49:39,429
TALIESIN: And then, so I'm 23 points in. Is it
worth blowing any of this? Yeah. Am I feeling the

2210
02:49:39,429 --> 02:49:40,614
healing?

2211
02:49:40,614 --> 02:49:43,395
MATT: No, your movement dropped you outside of the
circle.

2212
02:49:43,395 --> 02:49:45,828
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to use what little
I have left--

2213
02:49:45,828 --> 02:49:47,791
MATT: You have no more movement.

2214
02:49:47,791 --> 02:49:50,430
TALIESIN: I have no more movement, even from a
double-up? Using my action?

2215
02:49:50,430 --> 02:49:53,684
MATT: Oh, if you use your action for a dash? Then
you can get there, yeah.

2216
02:49:53,684 --> 02:49:58,026
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action for a dash to
stand on the trap. Like, stand right to the trap,

2217
02:49:58,026 --> 02:49:59,147
yeah.

2218
02:49:59,147 --> 02:50:02,068
MATT: Well the trapdoor you blew open, so it's
currently open. So you stand right at the edge of

2219
02:50:02,068 --> 02:50:02,784
it.

2220
02:50:02,784 --> 02:50:06,049
TALIESIN: I stand there and I'm waiting to see
what the hell is going on at this point.

2221
02:50:06,049 --> 02:50:09,899
MATT: Okay, ending Percival's turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

2222
02:50:09,899 --> 02:50:14,589
SAM: Scanlan's up. Scanlan's going to peek around
the corner.

2223
02:50:14,589 --> 02:50:20,216
MATT: You see Keyleth floating there. You see the
flames burst around this interior, the fog cloud

2224
02:50:20,216 --> 02:50:21,474
dissipates.

2225
02:50:21,474 --> 02:50:28,912
SAM: I'm going to throw in a Firebolt right in the
front door. Wand of Fireballs.

2226
02:50:28,912 --> 02:50:30,174
MATT: Okay. How many?

2227
02:50:30,174 --> 02:50:34,418
SAM: Two charges. That's 9d6.

2228
02:50:34,418 --> 02:50:35,751
LIAM: Where you at, girl?

2229
02:50:35,751 --> 02:50:38,629
MARISHA: To quote the rogue: You don't know.

2230
02:50:38,629 --> 02:50:47,377
MATT: You kick off the broken chest. Right as you
right yourself, a beam of red light goes into the

2231
02:50:47,377 --> 02:50:52,025
room, explodes a second time. Make a dexterity
save with a DC of--

2232
02:50:52,025 --> 02:50:54,452
SAM: 15.

2233
02:50:54,452 --> 02:50:59,853
LIAM: 20.

2234
02:50:59,853 --> 02:51:07,352
MATT: Yeah, so no damage. You're like, "Oh god!"
You leap out of the way and as you pull your cloak

2235
02:51:07,352 --> 02:51:12,599
up and the cloak burns and singes on the outside,
but you manage to avoid the damage as you flatten

2236
02:51:12,599 --> 02:51:13,909
up against the wall.

2237
02:51:13,909 --> 02:51:17,130
SAM: I got him, guys! He's real rough!

2238
02:51:17,130 --> 02:51:21,839
TRAVIS: Two fireballs in a bunker and no damage.

2239
02:51:21,839 --> 02:51:25,419
MATT: Unfortunately, that's exactly the kind of
thing that rogues are really good at avoiding.

2240
02:51:25,419 --> 02:51:32,213
They're an up-close or lock-down type scenario or
they're going to be jumping around all your booms.

2241
02:51:32,213 --> 02:51:34,605
Scanlan, that's your action.

2242
02:51:34,605 --> 02:51:45,098
SAM: Bonus action, I'm going to put on Gloves of
Swim/Climb. I think I got them in Pathfinder. I

2243
02:51:45,098 --> 02:51:46,425
don't know what they are.

2244
02:51:46,425 --> 02:51:48,898
MATT: They'll give you advantage on climbing
checks.

2245
02:51:48,898 --> 02:51:51,861
MARISHA: They're climbing flippers?

2246
02:51:51,861 --> 02:51:54,965
SAM: Great. That's it.

2247
02:51:54,965 --> 02:51:57,114
MATT: That's your turn. Grog.

2248
02:51:57,114 --> 02:51:58,836
TRAVIS: Yeah. What's up?

2249
02:51:58,836 --> 02:52:10,721
MATT: Top of your turn. The braziers on the sides
of the tower burst into flame, incinerating all the

2250
02:52:10,721 --> 02:52:14,296
space around, which affects Keyleth, who is hiding
behind the side of the tower. I need you to make a

2251
02:52:14,296 --> 02:52:16,966
dexterity saving throw.

2252
02:52:16,966 --> 02:52:18,655
MARISHA: I thought the circles were going?

2253
02:52:18,655 --> 02:52:19,889
TRAVIS: Nope. It's the fire.

2254
02:52:19,889 --> 02:52:22,926
MARISHA: The fires? Did I get behind?

2255
02:52:22,926 --> 02:52:24,112
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2256
02:52:24,112 --> 02:52:27,646
MARISHA: Goddamn it. That's fine.

2257
02:52:27,646 --> 02:52:29,541
MATT: Because the water glowed last time.

2258
02:52:29,541 --> 02:52:34,055
MARISHA: Dex saving throw? 15.

2259
02:52:34,055 --> 02:52:49,596
MATT: Nope. That is 30 points of fire damage to
you. As the flames subside, your wind form is

2260
02:52:49,596 --> 02:52:54,472
burned a bit. Grog, you're up.

2261
02:52:54,472 --> 02:52:59,984
TRAVIS: Would it be stupid to try to grapple a
wind elemental? There's not really anything to

2262
02:52:59,984 --> 02:53:01,298
grab, right?

2263
02:53:01,298 --> 02:53:08,382
MATT: I don't know. You hear the wind whipping
around outside, but you don't see anything.

2264
02:53:08,382 --> 02:53:14,489
TRAVIS: Could I step out the door? Like five
feet.

2265
02:53:14,489 --> 02:53:22,105
MATT: You look up immediately and see Keyleth
floating there in elemental form after the flames

2266
02:53:22,105 --> 02:53:23,478
subside.

2267
02:53:23,478 --> 02:53:29,637
TRAVIS: All right, let's just try it because fuck
it. Can I use my boots of feral leaping to make a

2268
02:53:29,637 --> 02:53:33,442
15-foot vertical leap with a DC of 16?

2269
02:53:33,442 --> 02:53:39,242
MATT: You can. She's 20 feet up in the air,
though. You glance up and she's 20 feet up.

2270
02:53:39,242 --> 02:53:45,677
TRAVIS: Just too much. Could I try and climb up
the side of the tower?

2271
02:53:45,677 --> 02:53:48,200
MATT: Sure. Make an athletics check.

2272
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:54,138
TRAVIS: 18.

2273
02:53:54,138 --> 02:53:58,267
MATT: Yeah, you're able to get up to about her
height. You're technically base-to-base with her

2274
02:53:58,267 --> 02:53:59,938
against the side of the tower.

2275
02:53:59,938 --> 02:54:04,289
TRAVIS: Cool. I'm going to leap off the tower and
try to grab onto Keyleth.

2276
02:54:04,289 --> 02:54:08,650
MATT: Make a grapple check.

2277
02:54:08,650 --> 02:54:11,133
MARISHA: I am immune to grapple.

2278
02:54:11,133 --> 02:54:12,757
MATT: I know, but I want him to roll it.

2279
02:54:12,757 --> 02:54:19,861
TRAVIS: Okay. What can I do in this game? Zero
because you're immune to grapple.

2280
02:54:19,861 --> 02:54:28,711
MATT: Grog, you fall through and land on the
ground prone and partially in the water. You

2281
02:54:28,711 --> 02:54:33,235
suffer eight points of bludgeoning damage, reduced
to four.

2282
02:54:33,235 --> 02:54:34,466
SAM: First blood.

2283
02:54:34,466 --> 02:54:40,322
TRAVIS: Cool.

2284
02:54:40,322 --> 02:54:50,957
MATT: You also notice the field that surrounds the
chambers shifts in a bit. Scanlan, make a

2285
02:54:50,957 --> 02:54:56,667
constitution saving throw. You watch as it all
closes in by five feet.

2286
02:54:56,667 --> 02:54:58,666
SAM: 28!

2287
02:54:58,666 --> 02:55:03,661
MARISHA: He put a time limit on this whole thing.

2288
02:55:03,661 --> 02:55:05,022
TALIESIN: Good man.

2289
02:55:05,022 --> 02:55:10,035
MATT: You take 11 points of force damage and you
are not forced out of the way. However, you are up

2290
02:55:10,035 --> 02:55:18,027
against it being pushed against the wall, you have
to squeeze out of it. You can see it slowly

2291
02:55:18,027 --> 02:55:25,891
condensing itself. As it does, you glance up at
the sky and see this grinning, mysterious visage

2292
02:55:25,891 --> 02:55:34,524
made of cloud swirling energy. A grinning beard.
That's the end of Grog's turn. Vax, you're up.

2293
02:55:34,524 --> 02:55:41,694
LIAM: Okay. I've got movement, bonus action,
hasted action, and my regular action. I'm going to use

2294
02:55:41,694 --> 02:55:49,005
movement and bonus action to blast out of that
door. Everybody sees me arc up into the sky and

2295
02:55:49,005 --> 02:55:56,827
fly over this tower and disappear here. I'll tell
you what happens next via text.

2296
02:55:56,827 --> 02:55:59,494
SAM: We got a little Liam there! Liam talked!

2297
02:55:59,494 --> 02:56:02,464
MARISHA: It's a bottle rocket! Oh wait, nope.

2298
02:56:02,464 --> 02:56:11,227
MATT: You saw him disappear somewhere down below
there. As far as you know, as a marker, somewhere

2299
02:56:11,227 --> 02:56:13,955
in that area you saw Vax vanish.

2300
02:56:13,955 --> 02:56:18,526
TRAVIS: Fucking flying motherfucker.

2301
02:56:18,526 --> 02:56:24,694
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

2302
02:56:24,694 --> 02:56:38,070
MARISHA: Okay. My turn. I've got a prone Grog in
front of me.

2303
02:56:38,070 --> 02:56:39,411
SAM: Yeah, man.

2304
02:56:39,411 --> 02:56:41,938
MARISHA: I'm going to do something great, right?

2305
02:56:41,938 --> 02:56:43,483
TRAVIS: Yep, fire it up.

2306
02:56:43,483 --> 02:56:58,420
MARISHA: Shit. But what to do? (grumbles) Oh god.

2307
02:56:58,420 --> 02:57:01,146
MATT: I'm confused by that image.

2308
02:57:01,146 --> 02:57:03,256
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to elaborate.

2309
02:57:03,256 --> 02:57:06,007
MATT: Keyleth, what're you doing?

2310
02:57:06,007 --> 02:57:11,112
MARISHA: Sorry, Grog. I'm going to try this one
more time.

2311
02:57:11,112 --> 02:57:13,534
TRAVIS: Do it, please. End my suffering.

2312
02:57:13,534 --> 02:57:15,689
MARISHA: I'm going to land.

2313
02:57:15,689 --> 02:57:18,692
TRAVIS: Give me some kind of contact with another
being.

2314
02:57:18,692 --> 02:57:24,125
MATT: You slowly descend, swirling wind arms.

2315
02:57:24,125 --> 02:57:28,832
MARISHA: I'm going to drop my form.

2316
02:57:28,832 --> 02:57:38,538
MATT: The wind form shifts out and Keyleth
descends, landing right down with you.

2317
02:57:38,538 --> 02:57:39,819
TRAVIS: Hey, Ki.

2318
02:57:39,819 --> 02:57:47,943
MARISHA: I'm going to say: Don't save against
this! And I'm going to try Plane Shift! Because it

2319
02:57:47,943 --> 02:57:50,013
fucking failed last time!

2320
02:57:50,013 --> 02:57:51,801
MATT: What's the saving throw on that?

2321
02:57:51,801 --> 02:57:53,801
MARISHA: Mine, 21.

2322
02:57:53,801 --> 02:57:55,150
MATT: No, but what's the saving throw?

2323
02:57:55,150 --> 02:57:56,689
MARISHA: I think it's wisdom.

2324
02:57:56,689 --> 02:57:58,636
MATT: Grog, I need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

2325
02:57:58,636 --> 02:58:03,475
TRAVIS: No problem. Modifier is zero. Five.

2326
02:58:03,475 --> 02:58:05,865
MATT: Where are you shifting him to?

2327
02:58:05,865 --> 02:58:09,880
MARISHA: Do you have any preference on your
demise?

2328
02:58:09,880 --> 02:58:11,550
SAM: Demise!

2329
02:58:11,550 --> 02:58:15,808
TRAVIS: I don't know. Send me to the Ethereal--
no. Send me to Feywild.

2330
02:58:15,808 --> 02:58:18,389
MARISHA: No. That's too nice.

2331
02:58:18,389 --> 02:58:19,792
TRAVIS: Fuck you!

2332
02:58:19,792 --> 02:58:24,964
(laughter)

2333
02:58:24,964 --> 02:58:30,148
MARISHA: My original plan was to teleport you to
the middle of the water dimension, just have you

2334
02:58:30,148 --> 02:58:31,639
slowly drown.

2335
02:58:31,639 --> 02:58:33,507
SAM and TALIESIN: Sounds pretty awesome.

2336
02:58:33,507 --> 02:58:34,738
LIAM: That's merciful.

2337
02:58:34,738 --> 02:58:39,750
MARISHA: Or my other idea was to send you to the
Maze of the Abyss.

2338
02:58:39,750 --> 02:58:42,786
LIAM: Nah, water is a minute or less, right?

2339
02:58:42,786 --> 02:58:46,377
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll go to the water.

2340
02:58:46,377 --> 02:58:52,883
MATT: Grog, as Keyleth embraces you, there's a
shifting of energy. There's a flash as you see the

2341
02:58:52,883 --> 02:58:57,953
Divine Gate coast past you. Suddenly, you're in
the dark depths of a familiar ocean.

2342
02:58:57,953 --> 02:59:01,748
TRAVIS: Figures.

2343
02:59:01,883 --> 02:59:04,806
MATT: You're holding your breath. You know with
your constitution, you can hold your breath for a

2344
02:59:04,806 --> 02:59:09,755
decent amount of time. As you glance down into the
darkness of the shadow below you, you see movement

2345
02:59:09,755 --> 02:59:16,161
as a series of long, familiar tentacles begin to
emerge from the shadows below. You think, "Let's

2346
02:59:16,161 --> 02:59:19,039
"make this a final, glorious way to go."

2347
02:59:19,039 --> 02:59:20,532
TRAVIS: Do I?

2348
02:59:20,532 --> 02:59:21,882
MATT: I don't know, do you?

2349
02:59:21,882 --> 02:59:23,588
TRAVIS: Probably not.

2350
02:59:23,588 --> 02:59:29,524
MATT: You slowly clam up as you sink down as the
kraken takes you into its maw and swallows you.

2351
02:59:29,524 --> 02:59:31,530
MARISHA: I feel so bad!

2352
02:59:31,530 --> 02:59:33,207
TRAVIS: Fight on!

2353
02:59:33,207 --> 02:59:36,075
MARISHA: Man, that doesn't feel good.

2354
02:59:36,075 --> 02:59:37,324
MATT: First one down.

2355
02:59:37,324 --> 02:59:40,488
MARISHA: It doesn't feel good to be a bully,
everyone, let this be a lesson.

2356
02:59:40,488 --> 02:59:46,617
TRAVIS: Doesn't feel good to be a level 20
barbarian with these strong motherfuckers. Chasing

2357
02:59:46,617 --> 02:59:48,041
your damn tail.

2358
02:59:48,041 --> 02:59:49,216
MARISHA: I still have movement, yeah.

2359
02:59:49,216 --> 02:59:53,746
MATT: You have, in this form, 15 feet.

2360
02:59:53,746 --> 02:59:58,738
TRAVIS: I also don't have a Deck, for anybody
that's wondering. There's no Deck of Many Things.

2361
02:59:58,738 --> 03:00:03,556
MARISHA: Scanlan dropped his Reverse Gravity,
yeah?

2362
03:00:03,556 --> 03:00:05,074
MATT: Correct.

2363
03:00:05,074 --> 03:00:07,864
MARISHA: Scanlan's there.

2364
03:00:07,864 --> 03:00:09,329
LIAM: I sent a clarification.

2365
03:00:09,329 --> 03:00:16,926
MARISHA: Do I have enough movement to move over
there? Actually, you know what? No one's in the

2366
03:00:16,926 --> 03:00:21,473
tower, right? You went over there. Oh, shit.
Goddamn it.

2367
03:00:21,473 --> 03:00:23,377
LIAM: Such a question, isn't it?

2368
03:00:23,377 --> 03:00:31,148
MARISHA: Do I have my bonus action still? I do,
right?

2369
03:00:31,148 --> 03:00:32,337
MATT: Yeah.

2370
03:00:32,337 --> 03:00:34,939
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into an earth elemental.

2371
03:00:34,939 --> 03:00:39,712
MATT: Is it a bonus action to drop form?

2372
03:00:39,712 --> 03:00:42,083
MARISHA: Oh fuck, yeah. It is.

2373
03:00:42,083 --> 03:00:43,662
MATT: I'll double-check.

2374
03:00:43,662 --> 03:00:52,503
MARISHA: Let me go over there. I can't reach.

2375
03:00:52,503 --> 03:01:05,828
MATT: Yep, it's a bonus action to revert, so you
have to be in Keyleth form. You have 15 feet of

2376
03:01:05,828 --> 03:01:06,853
movement.

2377
03:01:06,853 --> 03:01:09,315
MARISHA: I'm going to use my awesome mantle which
allows me to jump.

2378
03:01:09,315 --> 03:01:11,341
MATT: What's your strength?

2379
03:01:11,341 --> 03:01:13,177
MARISHA: What?

2380
03:01:13,177 --> 03:01:14,738
MATT: What's your strength score?

2381
03:01:14,738 --> 03:01:16,479
MARISHA: Just my modifier?

2382
03:01:16,479 --> 03:01:17,855
MATT: Your strength score.

2383
03:01:17,855 --> 03:01:21,694
MARISHA: My strength score is 14, so I have plus
two to my strength.

2384
03:01:21,694 --> 03:01:27,003
MATT: That's the distance you can jump in feet is
your strength score. So triple that, you can jump

2385
03:01:27,003 --> 03:01:28,223
pretty far.

2386
03:01:28,223 --> 03:01:35,050
MARISHA: Let me jump behind there. Do I have
enough, with the rest of my movement, can I get

2387
03:01:35,050 --> 03:01:36,467
inside this building?

2388
03:01:36,467 --> 03:01:38,420
MATT: No, that would be part of your movement.

2389
03:01:38,420 --> 03:01:39,625
MARISHA: Then I'll stay there.

2390
03:01:39,625 --> 03:01:43,442
MATT: Okay. Finishing Keyleth's turn, Percival,
you're up. You heal 20 hit points.

2391
03:01:43,442 --> 03:01:45,924
SAM: That's nice!

2392
03:01:45,924 --> 03:02:02,630
TALIESIN: I'm going to head this way on the tower.
(counting) Do I see Keyleth?

2393
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:06,228
MATT: Make a perception check.

2394
03:02:06,228 --> 03:02:12,289
TALIESIN: I'm down for that. That's a terrible
roll. That's 16.

2395
03:02:12,289 --> 03:02:18,787
MATT: She's not hiding, so you do see the very
edge of her. He has an eyeline to the very edge of

2396
03:02:18,787 --> 03:02:22,351
you. That's as far as you can get with your
movement. She has three-quarters cover.

2397
03:02:22,351 --> 03:02:26,502
TALIESIN: That doesn't matter to me. How far away
is she?

2398
03:02:26,502 --> 03:02:31,488
MATT: You're eyeballing maybe about 45, 50 feet.

2399
03:02:31,488 --> 03:02:41,353
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something really weird.
I'm going to pull out the Iron Bands of Bilarro.

2400
03:02:41,353 --> 03:02:49,503
I'm going to make a toss, try and nail her in the
head. It's got a range of 60 feet.

2401
03:02:49,503 --> 03:02:53,944
MATT: It does. Make a ranged attack roll.

2402
03:02:53,944 --> 03:02:57,547
LIAM: Take me out to the ball game!

2403
03:02:57,547 --> 03:03:02,139
MARISHA: Take me out to the-- what's after that?

2404
03:03:02,139 --> 03:03:03,198
TRAVIS: The crowd.

2405
03:03:03,198 --> 03:03:04,299
MARISHA: The crowd!

2406
03:03:04,299 --> 03:03:08,625
TALIESIN: 30.

2407
03:03:08,625 --> 03:03:11,115
SAM: It's a good throw.

2408
03:03:11,115 --> 03:03:22,647
MATT: All right. Keyleth, as you're ducking
around, you hear this faint shout in the distance of--

2409
03:03:22,647 --> 03:03:29,530
TALIESIN: Manners! Oh, you don't! Does it work?

2410
03:03:29,530 --> 03:03:30,710
MATT: No!

2411
03:03:30,710 --> 03:03:33,335
MARISHA: I have Freedom of Movement, too, cast on
me.

2412
03:03:33,335 --> 03:03:34,808
LIAM: Too late!

2413
03:03:34,808 --> 03:03:43,823
MATT: As the band expands and wraps around
Keyleth's body, you watch as she quickly slips out

2414
03:03:43,823 --> 03:03:48,708
of the bindings and the chains fall to the ground
before reverting back to a sphere.

2415
03:03:48,708 --> 03:03:50,893
TALIESIN: Damn!

2416
03:03:50,893 --> 03:03:54,803
LIAM: That's amazing!

2417
03:03:54,803 --> 03:03:58,271
TALIESIN: Fucking oh my god! That was clutch!

2418
03:03:58,271 --> 03:04:00,332
MARISHA: That was so good!

2419
03:04:00,332 --> 03:04:03,227
LIAM: Only because you remembered, holy shit!

2420
03:04:03,227 --> 03:04:05,442
MATT: That would have been bad.

2421
03:04:05,442 --> 03:04:09,289
TALIESIN: I just saw that happen, didn't I?

2422
03:04:09,289 --> 03:04:10,513
MATT: Yeah, you did.

2423
03:04:10,513 --> 03:04:12,547
TALIESIN: All right!

2424
03:04:12,547 --> 03:04:15,906
MARISHA: Thank god for that fucking 4th-level
spell.

2425
03:04:15,906 --> 03:04:26,788
TALIESIN: That was really scary. That was my
attack. I'm going to back off and then go back to

2426
03:04:26,788 --> 03:04:36,773
the center of that tower and sit and try to get
three-quarters cover over there. I want to stay in

2427
03:04:36,773 --> 03:04:38,173
the green light.

2428
03:04:38,173 --> 03:04:43,455
MATT: You're staying there and crouching low.
Ending Percival's turn, Scanlan, you're up. You

2429
03:04:43,455 --> 03:04:49,314
can see Keyleth from around.

2430
03:04:49,314 --> 03:04:50,410
SAM: I can?

2431
03:04:50,410 --> 03:04:52,145
MATT: You pull out of that side there.

2432
03:04:52,145 --> 03:04:54,583
SAM: I'm going to dash right towards Keyleth.

2433
03:04:54,583 --> 03:04:55,790
MATT: Dash?

2434
03:04:55,790 --> 03:04:57,066
SAM: No, just run.

2435
03:04:57,066 --> 03:04:58,689
MATT: That's your movement there.

2436
03:04:58,689 --> 03:04:59,993
SAM: How far away am I?

2437
03:04:59,993 --> 03:05:02,888
MATT: She's about 35, 40 feet.

2438
03:05:02,888 --> 03:05:05,059
SAM: So more than 30?

2439
03:05:05,059 --> 03:05:06,657
MATT: More than 30, correct.

2440
03:05:06,657 --> 03:05:07,964
SAM: Fuck you!

2441
03:05:07,964 --> 03:05:10,513
(laughter)

2442
03:05:10,513 --> 03:05:11,942
MATT: Yeah.

2443
03:05:11,942 --> 03:05:18,557
SAM: Goddamn it.

2444
03:05:18,557 --> 03:05:24,842
MATT: 35 feet, yeah.

2445
03:05:24,842 --> 03:05:35,594
SAM: Goddamn it! All right, I mean I'll just--

2446
03:05:35,594 --> 03:05:37,466
MATT: Sorry, Grog.

2447
03:05:37,466 --> 03:05:39,686
TRAVIS: A barbarian's world.

2448
03:05:39,686 --> 03:05:47,897
SAM: Sorry, changing my mind, seeing if this
works. What is the save?

2449
03:05:47,897 --> 03:05:51,441
MARISHA: Only when we reach level 20, boys, only
when we reach level 20.

2450
03:05:51,441 --> 03:05:53,166
SAM: Wisdom? She's so wise!

2451
03:05:53,166 --> 03:05:55,316
TALIESIN: Oh, a wise guy?

2452
03:05:55,316 --> 03:05:58,625
MARISHA: Early game druids kind of suck, later
games, kind of boss.

2453
03:05:58,625 --> 03:06:07,131
SAM: She's not immune to charm, though. I've
already charmed her once. Yeah, fuck it. One more

2454
03:06:07,131 --> 03:06:08,689
thing to check, sorry.

2455
03:06:08,689 --> 03:06:11,050
LIAM: Sam, 20 levels and you haven't got your
spells in order?

2456
03:06:11,050 --> 03:06:19,837
SAM: This is a brand new spell, I've never used
it! What's the range? It's 30 feet, great. I will

2457
03:06:19,837 --> 03:06:21,393
Dominate Person.

2458
03:06:21,393 --> 03:06:23,482
MATT: Dominate Person for Keyleth.

2459
03:06:23,482 --> 03:06:28,877
SAM: Yeah, it's not going to work because she's
super wise, but I'll try.

2460
03:06:28,877 --> 03:06:32,481
MATT: Okay, you need to make a wisdom saving
throw. You have advantage because you are

2461
03:06:32,481 --> 03:06:34,284
a half-elf, so you have advantage against charm
effects.

2462
03:06:34,284 --> 03:06:37,748
LIAM: Oh shit, with her wisdom? Good luck, buddy.

2463
03:06:37,748 --> 03:06:40,997
MARISHA: What do I have to save? 22?

2464
03:06:40,997 --> 03:06:42,325
SAM: 22.

2465
03:06:42,325 --> 03:06:56,446
MARISHA: Let me do the math really quick. Yeah, I'm
all right. I rolled a natural 16.

2466
03:06:56,446 --> 03:06:59,716
MATT: Sorry, Scanlan, she resists the spell.

2467
03:06:59,716 --> 03:07:12,132
SAM: It's fine. As my bonus action I will say to
her: That spell was an inspiration and we're still

2468
03:07:12,132 --> 03:07:14,728
on the same team, right?

2469
03:07:14,728 --> 03:07:20,377
MARISHA: I feel so bad I had to teleport Grog
away, but I'm still looking for Vax.

2470
03:07:20,377 --> 03:07:22,465
SAM: Okay, me too.

2471
03:07:22,465 --> 03:07:33,577
MATT: That finishes your turn. The field shimmies
and crunches even closer. You watch as this

2472
03:07:33,577 --> 03:07:36,758
distant building begins to collapse inward.

2473
03:07:36,758 --> 03:07:39,356
LIAM: Oh wow, Matt. Oh wow!

2474
03:07:39,356 --> 03:07:41,284
MARISHA: Did you turn it in?

2475
03:07:41,284 --> 03:07:43,601
MATT: That door's destroyed.

2476
03:07:43,601 --> 03:07:45,529
LIAM and MARISHA: Stay turnt.

2477
03:07:45,529 --> 03:07:46,992
TRAVIS: The portal's gone.

2478
03:07:46,992 --> 03:07:48,976
TALIESIN: So, two squares in all around.

2479
03:07:48,976 --> 03:07:50,807
MATT: Two squares in all around.

2480
03:07:50,807 --> 03:07:55,638
TALIESIN: I'm in. When we get four we actually
start to remove rock blocks.

2481
03:07:55,638 --> 03:07:59,424
SAM: What's up? Who's next?

2482
03:07:59,424 --> 03:08:00,591
MATT: Vax.

2483
03:08:00,591 --> 03:08:10,082
LIAM: I'm going to use my 120 feet of regular
movement to fly out of my hiding place into the

2484
03:08:10,082 --> 03:08:19,707
air. This is probably half my movement, right
about there. I can't see, about there. Don't

2485
03:08:19,707 --> 03:08:27,090
worry, this is temporary. I wouldn't do that. I
see Percival, Scanlan, Keyleth. I've used half my

2486
03:08:27,090 --> 03:08:32,750
movement about, I would guess. And I'm going to
use my bonus action to use Vow of Enmity on

2487
03:08:32,750 --> 03:08:34,272
Keyleth.

2488
03:08:34,272 --> 03:08:41,011
MATT: You watch as you suddenly turn and look up
into the sky as you see, giant wings unfolded, Vax

2489
03:08:41,011 --> 03:08:46,134
points down at you and with a giant
earth-shattering caw in the sky of a raven cry,

2490
03:08:46,134 --> 03:08:51,151
you feel this mark penetrate your chest, as he
marks you with his Vow of Enmity.

2491
03:08:51,151 --> 03:08:56,624
LIAM: I want to fly within 60 feet of her using
still my base movement.

2492
03:08:56,624 --> 03:08:58,356
MATT: You are about 60 feet here.

2493
03:08:58,356 --> 03:09:06,118
LIAM: I will use my regular paladin attack, which
is an attack-attack, to attack her. Which is at

2494
03:09:06,118 --> 03:09:08,302
advantage because of the Vow of Enmity.

2495
03:09:08,302 --> 03:09:09,594
MATT: Correct.

2496
03:09:09,594 --> 03:09:16,101
LIAM: Not great. I'm going to use a Luck. I'm
going to use a Luck. That's better. Not much

2497
03:09:16,101 --> 03:09:20,054
better. That is a 20.

2498
03:09:20,054 --> 03:09:21,374
MARISHA: Yeah.

2499
03:09:21,374 --> 03:09:40,865
LIAM: Right, so here we go, just a little bit,
though. A tickle for you, really. (counting) 28

2500
03:09:40,865 --> 03:09:43,558
and that's the first attack and then the second
attack--

2501
03:09:43,558 --> 03:09:45,191
MATT: Total of 28 on that one?

2502
03:09:45,191 --> 03:09:46,570
LIAM: 28, yeah, total.

2503
03:09:46,570 --> 03:09:48,019
MARISHA: 28 what damage?

2504
03:09:48,019 --> 03:09:55,114
LIAM: 28 damage. That was a combo, there was some
psychic, there was eight of psychic. Okay, then

2505
03:09:55,114 --> 03:10:03,704
the second attack is 25 to hit, which also hits,
but it's much dinkier. So that is eight.

2506
03:10:03,704 --> 03:10:06,661
MARISHA: Eight. That's 36 total.

2507
03:10:06,661 --> 03:10:19,284
LIAM: So that was movement plus paladin action,
and I will use my hasted action and bonus action.

2508
03:10:19,284 --> 03:10:24,736
I'll use my haste so I can go another 60 feet and
I'm going to fly about there. Then I'm going

2509
03:10:24,736 --> 03:10:30,206
to use my regular action to-- you guys don't
fucking know. I will tell you where I'm using my

2510
03:10:30,206 --> 03:10:32,468
bonus action to hide.

2511
03:10:32,468 --> 03:10:38,791
MATT: I'm sorry. What? You moved over, used your
paladin action to attack twice--

2512
03:10:38,791 --> 03:10:46,786
LIAM: Attack, attack for paladin action, and I
still have a hasted action and a bonus action. One

2513
03:10:46,786 --> 03:10:49,284
can be used for more movement--

2514
03:10:49,284 --> 03:10:52,347
MATT: Are you moving somewhere with one of your
actions? Is what I'm asking.

2515
03:10:52,347 --> 03:11:00,853
LIAM: 60 feet. Another 60 feet-ish for the base
movement to there. Everybody thinks I don't know

2516
03:11:00,853 --> 03:11:02,160
what I'm talking about!

2517
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:05,113
MATT: No, I know. I need clarification because
they need to know where you ran off to. They still

2518
03:11:05,113 --> 03:11:06,515
see you. You're still out in the open.

2519
03:11:06,515 --> 03:11:10,459
LIAM: So my base movement gets me to probably
about here, and I use my paladin attack to attack

2520
03:11:10,459 --> 03:11:17,706
twice, right? So I've got bonus action and a
hasted action left. That is 120 feet left on one,

2521
03:11:17,706 --> 03:11:20,033
and then I can use the bonus action to hide.

2522
03:11:20,033 --> 03:11:21,458
MATT: I'm so excited for the new campaign.

2523
03:11:21,458 --> 03:11:24,035
LIAM: I know! (laughter) Me too!

2524
03:11:24,035 --> 03:11:25,338
MATT: This is my own fault.

2525
03:11:25,338 --> 03:11:29,256
LIAM: I have a great character planned! I can't
wait, but I know that I can use another 120 feet

2526
03:11:29,256 --> 03:11:33,947
from here to get to there, there, there, or there
and a bonus action to hide. It's all in the

2527
03:11:33,947 --> 03:11:35,615
fucking book dudes!

2528
03:11:35,615 --> 03:11:40,252
MATT: Your movement is 120 feet, which got you to
there, right.

2529
03:11:40,252 --> 03:11:46,714
LIAM: Paladin action which is attack-attack, and I
still have hasted action which can be used for

2530
03:11:46,714 --> 03:11:47,578
movement--

2531
03:11:47,578 --> 03:11:50,715
MATT: Do it. Text me where you are.

2532
03:11:50,715 --> 03:11:51,627
LIAM: It's right!

2533
03:11:51,627 --> 03:11:55,322
MATT: It's correct! You're completely correct! You
are completely correct. No, don't get shit for it.

2534
03:11:55,322 --> 03:12:01,862
You're doing your job. It's just a process to work
out for the scenario of this type of event.

2535
03:12:01,862 --> 03:12:07,572
LIAM: Hey man, send a message to Mike Mearls about
the 5th edition handbook. Thanks, Mike Mearls, I

2536
03:12:07,572 --> 03:12:08,980
love the handbook.

2537
03:12:08,980 --> 03:12:11,385
MARISHA: It's okay, everyone hates me tonight, so
were all in the same boat.

2538
03:12:11,385 --> 03:12:13,511
MATT: All righty, ending Vax's turn, Keyleth,
you're up.

2539
03:12:13,511 --> 03:12:15,798
MARISHA: Huh?

2540
03:12:15,798 --> 03:12:22,860
MATT: You got shanked twice with two daggers after
the Vow of Enmity and watched your Vax vanish off

2541
03:12:22,860 --> 03:12:24,673
somewhere in-- which direction?

2542
03:12:24,673 --> 03:12:31,177
LIAM: The last anyone saw me is here. Keyleth saw
me here going in this direction.

2543
03:12:31,177 --> 03:12:38,404
MATT: You watched him vanish that way right behind
the tower. What are you doing, Keyleth? Percy,

2544
03:12:38,404 --> 03:12:39,922
you're on deck.

2545
03:12:39,922 --> 03:12:44,137
TRAVIS: Isn't Plane Shift concentration?

2546
03:12:44,137 --> 03:12:46,813
MATT: Plane Shift? I don't believe it is. It just
happens.

2547
03:12:46,813 --> 03:12:48,539
MARISHA: l will look, though.

2548
03:12:48,539 --> 03:12:51,508
MATT: Banishment is concentration, that's probably
what you were thinking of.

2549
03:12:51,508 --> 03:12:53,324
MARISHA: I didn't have any concentration spells up
either.

2550
03:12:53,324 --> 03:12:58,448
TRAVIS: I just meant if you get hit--

2551
03:12:58,448 --> 03:13:00,921
MARISHA: In case you come back. Let me actually
check.

2552
03:13:00,921 --> 03:13:02,949
MATT: Keyleth, you're fine. What you got?

2553
03:13:02,949 --> 03:13:10,680
MARISHA: Fuck, I hope this doesn't fuck up. Peek
around the corner. Do I see Scanlan?

2554
03:13:10,680 --> 03:13:13,684
MATT: Yeah. This whole time you see Scanlan
running up to you and telling you all this.

2555
03:13:13,684 --> 03:13:20,583
MARISHA: (laughs) Sure. I'm going to peek around,
see Scanlan and be like: Hey, buddy!

2556
03:13:20,583 --> 03:13:21,739
SAM: Hey!

2557
03:13:21,739 --> 03:13:23,032
MARISHA: You see Vax?

2558
03:13:23,032 --> 03:13:27,131
SAM: He was a blur. Came over, shot at you, and
left.

2559
03:13:27,131 --> 03:13:29,230
MARISHA: Cool, good to know. Feeblemind!

2560
03:13:29,230 --> 03:13:31,883
SAM: Oh shit! Counterspell level six!

2561
03:13:31,883 --> 03:13:35,929
MARISHA: Fail. Well, you still have to roll for
it. Feeblemind level eight.

2562
03:13:35,929 --> 03:13:43,684
MATT: Feeblemind is an 8th-level spell. Go ahead
and roll-- (laugh) Okay, hold on.

2563
03:13:43,684 --> 03:13:48,619
SAM: Ah wait, the range is 30 feet.

2564
03:13:48,619 --> 03:13:51,489
TALIESIN: She moved five feet.

2565
03:13:51,489 --> 03:13:53,163
MATT: She did move up to peek, she said.

2566
03:13:53,163 --> 03:13:55,425
MARISHA: Range for Feeblemind is 150 feet.

2567
03:13:55,425 --> 03:13:57,064
SAM: Oh, okay. Sorry.

2568
03:13:57,064 --> 03:14:02,635
MATT: Wait, 60-foot range for Counterspell,
right?

2569
03:14:02,635 --> 03:14:04,280
SAM: Probably, yeah.

2570
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:05,459
MATT: I'm pretty sure it is.

2571
03:14:05,459 --> 03:14:09,265
SAM: Yeah, It says range 60, it's used as a
reaction.

2572
03:14:09,265 --> 03:14:13,128
MATT: Yeah I know, doesn't matter either way. All
right, for you it's a Counterspell.

2573
03:14:13,128 --> 03:14:14,707
MARISHA: I should've backed up.

2574
03:14:14,707 --> 03:14:20,033
MATT: Yeah, you should've moved. It's all good. I
need you to make an ability check using your

2575
03:14:20,033 --> 03:14:22,078
spellcasting ability, so a charisma check.

2576
03:14:22,078 --> 03:14:24,296
MARISHA: And what does he have to do?

2577
03:14:24,296 --> 03:14:31,256
SAM: Wait, what? No. Counterspell is ten plus the
level, wait, what?

2578
03:14:31,256 --> 03:14:34,758
MATT: The DC equals ten plus level of the spell.
You have to roll a check and add your charisma

2579
03:14:34,758 --> 03:14:35,810
bonus.

2580
03:14:35,810 --> 03:14:39,526
SAM: Got it. So that's 13 plus six is 19.

2581
03:14:39,526 --> 03:14:42,884
MATT: 19. You need to beat 18 DC because it's an
8th-level spell you said?

2582
03:14:42,884 --> 03:14:44,715
MARISHA: Yes.

2583
03:14:44,715 --> 03:14:47,830
MATT: He needs to beat an 18. Counterspelled
Feeblemind.

2584
03:14:47,830 --> 03:14:49,326
MARISHA: You rolled a 19?

2585
03:14:49,326 --> 03:14:50,500
SAM: Yeah.

2586
03:14:50,500 --> 03:14:54,467
MATT: So as she goes to cast Feeblemind you
recognize the incantation from when she used it on

2587
03:14:54,467 --> 03:14:58,106
Raishan and you go--

2588
03:14:58,106 --> 03:15:00,949
SAM: I go: Verily you are-- bad person!

2589
03:15:00,949 --> 03:15:04,108
MATT: As the Feeblemind fades--

2590
03:15:04,108 --> 03:15:07,770
MARISHA: Fuck! I should've fucking been out of
range!

2591
03:15:07,770 --> 03:15:09,309
SAM: We're both making mistakes!

2592
03:15:09,309 --> 03:15:10,514
MARISHA: We're both really good!

2593
03:15:10,514 --> 03:15:11,349
SAM: I know.

2594
03:15:11,349 --> 03:15:12,629
MARISHA: I respect you so much!

2595
03:15:12,629 --> 03:15:14,793
SAM: I do too. We're making stupid mistakes
because we're so anxious.

2596
03:15:14,793 --> 03:15:16,198
MARISHA: But we're so good.

2597
03:15:16,198 --> 03:15:17,279
SAM: We really are.

2598
03:15:17,279 --> 03:15:22,237
MARISHA: We're great. And then I'm going to go to
my earth elemental form. I've still got shit to

2599
03:15:22,237 --> 03:15:35,849
do. I'm going to use my movement. Can I jump back
over and run behind the tower this way?

2600
03:15:35,849 --> 03:15:38,179
MATT: What's the movement of your elemental
again?

2601
03:15:38,179 --> 03:15:42,872
MARISHA: 30 feet. This way.

2602
03:15:42,872 --> 03:15:46,279
MATT: (counting) That's as far as you can get
right there.

2603
03:15:46,279 --> 03:15:57,753
MARISHA: Instead of curving around, can I just go
straight away from the blue thing? Just in case

2604
03:15:57,753 --> 03:15:59,696
the blue thing hurts.

2605
03:15:59,696 --> 03:16:01,804
MATT: What's that? You want to go around and
look?

2606
03:16:01,804 --> 03:16:04,923
MARISHA: Instead of curving, can I just go further
from the blue thing?

2607
03:16:04,923 --> 03:16:08,835
TALIESIN: Remember it's two points in at this
point.

2608
03:16:08,835 --> 03:16:15,976
SAM, TALIESIN, and LIAM: (singing) What's that
blue thing doing there?

2609
03:16:15,976 --> 03:16:21,422
TALIESIN: Oh man, we did grow up in that era,
didn't we? Oh, that brought it back.

2610
03:16:21,422 --> 03:16:27,190
MATT: Last turn when the fields shattered, it did
cause the lighting to go off. I forgot to mention that.

2611
03:16:27,190 --> 03:16:30,961
SAM: What lighting?

2612
03:16:30,961 --> 03:16:31,756
MARISHA: The blue?

2613
03:16:31,756 --> 03:16:32,345
MATT: Yes.

2614
03:16:32,345 --> 03:16:33,719
TALIESIN: The one Scanlan was next to?

2615
03:16:33,719 --> 03:16:36,862
MATT: Last round both of you were out of range so
I didn't mention it. I forgot about it in the

2616
03:16:36,862 --> 03:16:38,487
process, I was focusing on the field.

2617
03:16:38,487 --> 03:16:40,031
MARISHA: The blue thing went.

2618
03:16:40,031 --> 03:16:40,969
MATT: Yes.

2619
03:16:40,969 --> 03:16:42,118
MARISHA: So the circle is up next.

2620
03:16:42,118 --> 03:16:45,472
MATT: Possibly. So are you staying in the water?

2621
03:16:45,472 --> 03:16:53,094
MARISHA: No, if that's the case, let me step back.
Right there.

2622
03:16:53,094 --> 03:16:55,300
MATT: I'll put you there. At the end of Scanlan's
turn--

2623
03:16:55,300 --> 03:16:56,868
SAM: That was Keyleth's turn.

2624
03:16:56,868 --> 03:17:04,499
MATT: Sorry, Keyleth. You watch as the water and
the two chambers flash and the chamber crushes

2625
03:17:04,499 --> 03:17:11,876
even further. This is partially destroyed. And now
you're seeing-- we're using this as a marker--

2626
03:17:11,876 --> 03:17:19,629
it's starting to accelerate the destruction in the
interior. Pushing this in here.

2627
03:17:19,629 --> 03:17:23,722
LIAM: It's about to get real on the field back.

2628
03:17:23,722 --> 03:17:30,165
SAM: Why would Colville do this to us? He's a kind
and gentle lord.

2629
03:17:30,165 --> 03:17:38,661
MATT: Using that as a mark. That falls back to
this partially destroyed there.

2630
03:17:38,661 --> 03:17:41,630
SAM: Wow. All this work destroyed.

2631
03:17:41,630 --> 03:17:46,826
MATT: I know. All righty. Vax, sorry, Percival.

2632
03:17:46,826 --> 03:17:50,989
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up right over here.

2633
03:17:50,989 --> 03:17:55,186
MATT: I'm confused. The field should happen later
this round, but we'll get to it.

2634
03:17:55,186 --> 03:18:00,629
TALIESIN: I'm getting up over here on this point
of the tower and I'm holding my action until I see

2635
03:18:00,629 --> 03:18:05,887
even the slightest fucking little black feather
appear anywhere on this field and I'm going to lay

2636
03:18:05,887 --> 03:18:07,513
goddamn waste.

2637
03:18:07,513 --> 03:18:10,377
MATT: Okay. Ending Percival's turn, Scanlan, your
turn.

2638
03:18:10,377 --> 03:18:22,541
SAM: I run after Keyleth and I say: Wait I forgot!
Feeblemind. I will use Wish to cast Feeblemind on her.

2639
03:18:22,541 --> 03:18:30,997
MARISHA: All right.

2640
03:18:30,997 --> 03:18:35,015
MATT: Keyleth, I need you to make an intelligence
saving throw.

2641
03:18:35,015 --> 03:18:38,764
MARISHA: Just straight intelligence? Do I get
anything?

2642
03:18:38,764 --> 03:18:41,129
MATT: Whatever your intelligence saving throw is.

2643
03:18:41,129 --> 03:18:45,444
MARISHA: As the earth elemental? I keep my mental
stats, though.

2644
03:18:45,444 --> 03:18:47,547
MATT: That's right, because it's Wild Shape you
keep your mental stats.

2645
03:18:47,547 --> 03:18:52,018
MARISHA: Not that that means anything. Okay.

2646
03:18:52,018 --> 03:18:55,840
TALIESIN: Wow. I mean he had to get clutch, didn't
he?

2647
03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:58,602
TRAVIS: Drop that motherfucker.

2648
03:18:58,602 --> 03:19:01,843
MARISHA: I'm trying to make sure that I don't have
any type of weird resistance--

2649
03:19:01,843 --> 03:19:05,452
SAM: To impossible to defeat spells?

2650
03:19:05,452 --> 03:19:07,755
(groaning)

2651
03:19:07,755 --> 03:19:10,659
MARISHA: Terrible!

2652
03:19:10,659 --> 03:19:13,285
MATT: So roll 4d6 psychic damage.

2653
03:19:13,285 --> 03:19:16,095
TRAVIS: He's the king for a reason you guys.

2654
03:19:16,095 --> 03:19:19,961
MARISHA: He tried to do what he did to me!

2655
03:19:19,961 --> 03:19:21,510
SAM: 11.

2656
03:19:21,510 --> 03:19:26,483
MATT: So you take 11 points of psychic damage,
Keyleth. Your intelligence and charisma scores

2657
03:19:26,483 --> 03:19:34,176
become one. You cannot cast spells, activate magic
items, understand language or communicate in any

2658
03:19:34,176 --> 03:19:35,568
intelligible way.

2659
03:19:35,568 --> 03:19:38,169
MARISHA: Okay, I take how many? 11 psychic
damage?

2660
03:19:38,169 --> 03:19:39,746
LIAM: Wow.

2661
03:19:39,746 --> 03:19:43,211
MARISHA: So I'm at 115.

2662
03:19:43,211 --> 03:19:46,473
TALIESIN: That's changed things, hasn't it?

2663
03:19:46,473 --> 03:19:50,224
MATT: That's a swing cast right there.

2664
03:19:50,224 --> 03:19:54,817
TALIESIN: You're still a player.

2665
03:19:54,817 --> 03:19:56,124
MARISHA: I'm still going.

2666
03:19:56,124 --> 03:19:57,014
MATT: Yeah.

2667
03:19:57,014 --> 03:19:58,604
MARISHA: Don't count me out.

2668
03:19:58,604 --> 03:20:00,368
TALIESIN: She's now just a barbarian.

2669
03:20:00,368 --> 03:20:01,518
MARISHA: Yeah.

2670
03:20:01,518 --> 03:20:02,789
TRAVIS: Can you shift into things?

2671
03:20:02,789 --> 03:20:03,633
TALIESIN: No.

2672
03:20:03,633 --> 03:20:04,984
MARISHA: Well, I'm currently shifted.

2673
03:20:04,984 --> 03:20:06,361
TALIESIN: She can't unshift.

2674
03:20:06,361 --> 03:20:09,369
MARISHA: Casting a spell isn't considered a part
of Wild Shape.

2675
03:20:09,369 --> 03:20:12,824
MATT: Wild Shape is not casting a spell, it's an
ability. She can still Wild Shape.

2676
03:20:12,824 --> 03:20:15,125
SAM: She can still fucking Wild Shape every turn.

2677
03:20:15,125 --> 03:20:18,322
MARISHA: It's an inherent druid nature ability,
it's not a spell.

2678
03:20:18,322 --> 03:20:21,076
LIAM: Would you know to do that in a frenzy?

2679
03:20:21,076 --> 03:20:23,066
MATT: It's not a frenzy.

2680
03:20:23,066 --> 03:20:25,509
MARISHA: Who, me?

2681
03:20:25,509 --> 03:20:27,829
MATT: Scanlan.

2682
03:20:27,829 --> 03:20:33,548
SAM: Yes. I'll duck somewhere so she can't see
me.

2683
03:20:33,548 --> 03:20:39,052
MATT: We'll say you got that far. Do you move in
there?

2684
03:20:39,052 --> 03:20:43,318
SAM: You said Feeblemind has a super long range,
right? I didn't move at all. I'm going to move

2685
03:20:43,318 --> 03:20:45,100
back over this way.

2686
03:20:45,100 --> 03:20:50,654
MATT: We'll put you there. It's my fault for
moving you. That finishes Scanlan's turn. Now the

2687
03:20:50,654 --> 03:20:59,628
field crushes in where it should've before. That was my
fault for doing it out of turn. Also, the flames

2688
03:20:59,680 --> 03:21:05,757
burst around the chamber. Percival, where are you
right now?

2689
03:21:05,757 --> 03:21:08,459
TALIESIN: I was just inside, over here.

2690
03:21:08,459 --> 03:21:11,444
MATT: You duck out of the way as the flames--

2691
03:21:11,444 --> 03:21:13,329
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out.

2692
03:21:13,329 --> 03:21:16,475
MATT: That brings us to Vax's turn.

2693
03:21:16,475 --> 03:21:18,712
LIAM: Okay, I need to ask a question. Here it
comes.

2694
03:21:18,712 --> 03:21:22,341
MATT: My phone's starting to get low on battery.

2695
03:21:22,341 --> 03:21:24,473
LIAM: I'm plugged in by a computer.

2696
03:21:24,473 --> 03:21:31,082
MATT: Okay. Yes.

2697
03:21:31,082 --> 03:21:42,053
LIAM: I'm going to use paladin attack-attack.
That's good. Even better. That's 33 to hit.

2698
03:21:42,053 --> 03:21:43,883
MATT: Percival, what's your armor class?

2699
03:21:43,883 --> 03:21:45,266
TALIESIN: 18. That's fine.

2700
03:21:45,266 --> 03:21:55,029
MATT: Steps and is throwing daggers from the trap
door. He's inside the tower and rushed up.

2701
03:21:55,029 --> 03:21:57,799
TALIESIN: This means I get to take my attacks.

2702
03:21:57,799 --> 03:21:59,756
MATT: You do. After his first attack.

2703
03:21:59,756 --> 03:22:01,034
TALIESIN: That's fine.

2704
03:22:01,034 --> 03:22:10,808
LIAM: 38 on the first. Does he attack between my
two daggers?

2705
03:22:10,808 --> 03:22:13,403
MATT: It's his reaction. He hits as soon as your
first attack hits.

2706
03:22:13,403 --> 03:22:14,634
LIAM: 38 on the first.

2707
03:22:14,634 --> 03:22:15,609
TALIESIN: How much?

2708
03:22:15,609 --> 03:22:16,357
LIAM: 38.

2709
03:22:16,357 --> 03:22:17,588
MATT: 38 points of piercing damage to you.

2710
03:22:17,588 --> 03:22:18,683
TALIESIN: That's fine.

2711
03:22:18,683 --> 03:22:20,728
LIAM: Some of it's psychic, but who's counting?

2712
03:22:20,728 --> 03:22:25,330
MATT: Technically, no. You'd finish your action, which
is your attack action, and then he does all of his.

2713
03:22:25,330 --> 03:22:34,296
LIAM: Good. 25. That hit?

2714
03:22:34,296 --> 03:22:35,923
TALIESIN: 25 hits.

2715
03:22:35,923 --> 03:22:37,446
LIAM: That's eight.

2716
03:22:37,446 --> 03:22:39,247
MATT: Eight points of piercing damage.

2717
03:22:39,247 --> 03:22:43,015
LIAM: I will dump venom into it. You have to
succeed a DC 15.

2718
03:22:43,015 --> 03:22:47,378
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

2719
03:22:47,378 --> 03:22:53,002
TALIESIN: Yeah. Like 23.

2720
03:22:53,002 --> 03:22:59,534
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. As you throw both
daggers, you watch as Percival spins around with--

2721
03:22:59,534 --> 03:23:00,781
which weapon?

2722
03:23:00,781 --> 03:23:02,272
TALIESIN: I was going to use Animus.

2723
03:23:02,272 --> 03:23:05,226
MATT: With Animus and goes for his four attacks.

2724
03:23:05,226 --> 03:23:07,540
LIAM: Bring it.

2725
03:23:07,540 --> 03:23:11,244
TALIESIN: I can do real attacks because this is my
real--

2726
03:23:11,244 --> 03:23:14,694
MATT: Yeah, you were holding your action. You can
spend any grit you've got.

2727
03:23:14,694 --> 03:23:20,933
TALIESIN: This is sharpshooter. No, he's hard to hit
the first time.

2728
03:23:20,933 --> 03:23:26,064
MATT: He doesn't have that. Remember, Kerr took
away his cloak a long time ago.

2729
03:23:26,064 --> 03:23:27,764
TALIESIN: Cool. Sharpshooter.

2730
03:23:27,764 --> 03:23:32,317
LIAM: I was going to say I peeked up, but he's
sharpshooter.

2731
03:23:32,317 --> 03:23:41,169
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter plus I'm going to do
deadeye because I really want to hit this.

2732
03:23:41,169 --> 03:23:43,639
LIAM: You've only got four chances.

2733
03:23:43,639 --> 03:23:46,057
TALIESIN: That crits.

2734
03:23:46,057 --> 03:23:47,961
LIAM: What'd you roll?

2735
03:23:47,961 --> 03:23:49,320
TALIESIN: 19.

2736
03:23:49,320 --> 03:23:50,415
LIAM: And?

2737
03:23:50,415 --> 03:23:51,632
TALIESIN: Three.

2738
03:23:51,632 --> 03:23:53,983
LIAM: I'll use my last Luck. You have to reroll
the 19.

2739
03:23:53,983 --> 03:23:55,690
TALIESIN: Can you do that?

2740
03:23:55,690 --> 03:23:57,532
LIAM: Yes, I can. On attacks, yes I can.

2741
03:23:57,532 --> 03:23:59,915
SAM: He's checking if you do it before the roll or
not.

2742
03:23:59,915 --> 03:24:01,485
MATT: No.

2743
03:24:01,485 --> 03:24:08,784
LIAM: And it's my last Luck, so your next three
are clear. Absolutely can you use Luck on other

2744
03:24:08,784 --> 03:24:09,974
people's stuff.

2745
03:24:09,974 --> 03:24:13,809
SAM: I am calling it now: Keyleth still wins.

2746
03:24:13,809 --> 03:24:20,930
LIAM: And I can't remember if it's my third Luck
or fourth, so we're just going to call it my

2747
03:24:20,930 --> 03:24:22,422
fourth Luck.

2748
03:24:22,422 --> 03:24:25,876
MATT: You roll a d20 and choose whether.

2749
03:24:25,876 --> 03:24:29,019
LIAM: That's a two!

2750
03:24:29,019 --> 03:24:33,149
MATT: So the first attack misses.

2751
03:24:33,149 --> 03:24:36,809
TALIESIN: The first attack just misses? He can
just negate it.

2752
03:24:36,809 --> 03:24:41,002
MATT: He gets to choose whether you take his roll
or yours. He rolled a two.

2753
03:24:41,002 --> 03:24:43,785
LIAM: You've got three more shots. Of course
you're going to shoot me.

2754
03:24:43,785 --> 03:24:51,936
TALIESIN: I don't get my grit back, then? I
already marked it, it's fine. Let's do that again.

2755
03:24:51,936 --> 03:24:54,150
Let's twist again like we did last summer.

2756
03:24:54,150 --> 03:24:55,825
LIAM: Good old 11 Lucks Vax.

2757
03:24:55,825 --> 03:25:01,428
TALIESIN: That's a 26 to hit.

2758
03:25:01,428 --> 03:25:06,038
LIAM: Sure, that hits. I'll use Uncanny Dodge on
this one since I can see him.

2759
03:25:06,038 --> 03:25:14,453
TALIESIN: 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic, which is three,
four, five.

2760
03:25:14,453 --> 03:25:16,203
LIAM: First blood.

2761
03:25:16,203 --> 03:25:23,778
TALIESIN: Where's my brain? That's 23 points.

2762
03:25:23,778 --> 03:25:28,217
MATT: So you take 11.

2763
03:25:28,217 --> 03:25:32,848
TALIESIN: My third hit. Here we go.

2764
03:25:32,848 --> 03:25:34,257
MATT: You spending another grit?

2765
03:25:34,257 --> 03:25:43,272
TALIESIN: I'm spending another grit. Yeah, it'll
be no fun. No, I'm not going to spend another

2766
03:25:43,272 --> 03:25:52,305
grit. Still sharpshooter. That's 23 to hit.

2767
03:25:52,305 --> 03:25:55,068
LIAM: Just hits!

2768
03:25:55,068 --> 03:26:04,637
TALIESIN: I'm rolling so poorly. 20 points of
damage, plus five psychic, so 25.

2769
03:26:04,637 --> 03:26:06,428
LIAM: That's first blood.

2770
03:26:06,428 --> 03:26:14,279
TALIESIN: I can't spend an action surge in this
round, can I? On a held action.

2771
03:26:14,279 --> 03:26:30,297
MATT: On your turn is how it happens. Double check
for you, but I'm pretty sure. On your turn.

2772
03:26:30,297 --> 03:26:35,905
LIAM: You've got one more shot. Come on. Draw
blood.

2773
03:26:35,905 --> 03:26:42,734
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Thunderwave instead of
shooting.

2774
03:26:42,734 --> 03:26:46,844
MATT: Thunderwave is an action, it's not an
attack.

2775
03:26:46,844 --> 03:26:50,908
TALIESIN: That's fair. I would have done that at
the beginning if I would have thought about it.

2776
03:26:50,908 --> 03:27:00,662
Same thing. 15, so that hits. 26 to hit.

2777
03:27:00,662 --> 03:27:02,424
LIAM: Definitely.

2778
03:27:02,424 --> 03:27:07,685
TALIESIN: That's 24 points of damage.

2779
03:27:07,685 --> 03:27:09,020
LIAM: Gotcha.

2780
03:27:09,020 --> 03:27:14,699
MATT: That ends your reaction. That ends your
attacks. You can take the rest of your turn.

2781
03:27:14,699 --> 03:27:18,781
LIAM: Question. Is the green beam still there?
Does it do anything? Are you going to tell me

2782
03:27:18,781 --> 03:27:20,641
later? Just throwing it out there.

2783
03:27:20,641 --> 03:27:25,001
MATT: You can feel the warmth around you, but it's
not doing anything immediately. You have to start

2784
03:27:25,001 --> 03:27:26,205
your turn there.

2785
03:27:26,205 --> 03:27:30,090
LIAM: Those were my two actions, right? I don't
need to disengage because I'm not within melee.

2786
03:27:30,090 --> 03:27:38,294
Right back down. That was-- okay.

2787
03:27:38,294 --> 03:27:42,828
TALIESIN: Oh, I have to roll to see if I keep my
spell. Con save.

2788
03:27:42,828 --> 03:27:46,581
MATT: Go for it.

2789
03:27:46,581 --> 03:27:54,163
TALIESIN: 25.

2790
03:27:54,163 --> 03:27:57,028
MATT: 25 succeeds on the first one. Roll again for
the second one.

2791
03:27:57,028 --> 03:28:01,107
TALIESIN: 25.

2792
03:28:01,107 --> 03:28:05,508
MATT: You still maintain it. That finishes Vax's
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

2793
03:28:05,508 --> 03:28:11,503
MARISHA: Do I see Vax at all? Probably not.

2794
03:28:11,503 --> 03:28:12,676
MATT: No, you do not see Vax at all.

2795
03:28:12,676 --> 03:28:22,940
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into a water elemental and swan dive into the

2796
03:28:22,940 --> 03:28:34,448
water. Then I'm going to swim over to the edge of
the pond where Scanlan is. 90 feet.

2797
03:28:34,448 --> 03:28:36,335
MATT: You're right over.

2798
03:28:36,335 --> 03:28:39,631
MARISHA: Yep. I'm going to come out of the water
and I'm--

2799
03:28:39,631 --> 03:28:42,414
SAM: How does she know where I am?!

2800
03:28:42,414 --> 03:28:56,502
MARISHA: You fucking Feebleminded! I can still
see, motherfucker! I still have eyes! I'm going to

2801
03:28:56,502 --> 03:29:00,155
come out of the water and I'm going to attempt to
whelm him.

2802
03:29:00,155 --> 03:29:04,515
SAM: What's that even mean? Not overwhelmed, just
whelmed.

2803
03:29:04,515 --> 03:29:09,242
MARISHA: Whelm. Make a strength saving throw.

2804
03:29:09,242 --> 03:29:18,692
SAM: A strength saving throw. Okay. These aren't
good. 14.

2805
03:29:18,692 --> 03:29:20,367
MARISHA: Failure!

2806
03:29:20,367 --> 03:29:25,468
SAM: Can I Cutting Words? No, right?

2807
03:29:25,468 --> 03:29:27,101
MATT: No, it's your own check.

2808
03:29:27,101 --> 03:29:32,894
MARISHA: It's an attack. You take 2d8 bludgeoning
damage.

2809
03:29:32,894 --> 03:29:35,883
MATT: You can Cutting Words to reduce the damage
if you'd like to.

2810
03:29:35,883 --> 03:29:48,442
MARISHA: 11 plus four, so 15 damage. You are
grappled and unable to breathe.

2811
03:29:48,442 --> 03:29:50,012
SAM: Jesus!

2812
03:29:50,012 --> 03:29:55,355
MARISHA: Do I still have movement?

2813
03:29:55,355 --> 03:30:02,654
MATT: You do. You have about 30 feet of movement
left. Probably about 20, since you did use some of

2814
03:30:02,654 --> 03:30:04,922
your movement to get into the water.

2815
03:30:04,922 --> 03:30:08,066
MARISHA: That's okay. I just want to take my
grapple with him and my whelm and take him back

2816
03:30:08,066 --> 03:30:09,756
under into this creek.

2817
03:30:09,756 --> 03:30:11,920
SAM: You can do that?

2818
03:30:11,920 --> 03:30:12,885
MARISHA: Yes.

2819
03:30:12,885 --> 03:30:16,775
SAM: You can hit, grab, and pull all on one
action?

2820
03:30:16,775 --> 03:30:23,243
MARISHA: Whelm. It's my ability. I'm basically a
big elemental and you're stuck inside of me.

2821
03:30:23,243 --> 03:30:28,505
SAM: But like, Bigby's Hand can either hit or
grab, not hit and grab and pull.

2822
03:30:28,505 --> 03:30:29,867
TALIESIN: Bigby's Hand is not a beast.

2823
03:30:29,867 --> 03:30:32,492
MATT: It's a different effect, unfortunately. Let
me see here.

2824
03:30:32,492 --> 03:30:42,129
TALIESIN: Yeah, I forgot to bleed you. Damn. It's
okay.

2825
03:30:42,129 --> 03:30:46,577
MATT: Yeah, you are restrained and unable to
breathe.

2826
03:30:46,577 --> 03:30:50,227
SAM: And she's pulling me away?

2827
03:30:50,227 --> 03:30:52,692
MARISHA: I mean, you're stuck inside of me until
further notice.

2828
03:30:52,692 --> 03:30:58,227
MATT: Yeah, because you're whelmed and he's a tiny
gnome, yeah. So you pull him into the water. So

2829
03:30:58,227 --> 03:31:04,443
you're in her space currently, inside Keyleth's
elemental form, unable to get out and pulled under

2830
03:31:04,443 --> 03:31:06,819
the water. Keyleth, does that end your turn?

2831
03:31:06,819 --> 03:31:08,335
MARISHA: Yes.

2832
03:31:08,335 --> 03:31:09,469
MATT: Percival.

2833
03:31:09,469 --> 03:31:15,142
MARISHA: And I'm now under the water, hiding with
Scanlan inside of my belly.

2834
03:31:15,142 --> 03:31:18,018
LIAM: You should check hoo-ha.

2835
03:31:18,018 --> 03:31:19,481
MATT: I'm checking.

2836
03:31:19,481 --> 03:31:24,405
TALIESIN: I assume, because he's got five billion
feet of range, that he is long gone?

2837
03:31:24,405 --> 03:31:31,627
MATT: You get the sense that he is not just beyond
that door.

2838
03:31:31,627 --> 03:31:41,962
TALIESIN: Cool. I'm going to shift to the other
side of the tower, stay in the healing range, and

2839
03:31:41,962 --> 03:31:47,126
hold my goddamn-- I'm going to run over here, stay
in the little green light, hold my fucking action

2840
03:31:47,126 --> 03:31:50,019
until I see feather. I'm up and ready.

2841
03:31:50,019 --> 03:31:52,123
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percival?

2842
03:31:52,123 --> 03:31:54,575
TALIESIN: And do I heal, since I'm in the green?

2843
03:31:54,575 --> 03:31:59,310
MATT: No, because you started your turn out of it.
The green has to be inside the center circle.

2844
03:31:59,310 --> 03:32:03,255
TALIESIN: In that case, I'll use my bonus action
to down a healing potion.

2845
03:32:03,255 --> 03:32:06,244
MATT: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up.

2846
03:32:06,244 --> 03:32:08,897
LIAM: Did the green beam do anything for me or did
it not work?

2847
03:32:08,897 --> 03:32:11,912
MATT: You have to start your turn in the beam in
order to get the effect.

2848
03:32:11,912 --> 03:32:22,022
SAM: So her intelligence and charisma went to one,
but her wisdom still exists? Okay. Good to know.

2849
03:32:22,022 --> 03:32:29,031
All right. Can I use verbally-based spells?

2850
03:32:29,031 --> 03:32:32,235
MATT: We said previously that you can still cast
underwater.

2851
03:32:32,235 --> 03:32:42,208
SAM: Okay. Then I will cast underwater and cast
Dimension Door.

2852
03:32:42,208 --> 03:32:44,739
MARISHA: Aw, I knew he was going to do that!

2853
03:32:44,739 --> 03:32:46,700
TALIESIN: Does he have to be able to talk in order
to do that?

2854
03:32:46,700 --> 03:32:47,896
SAM: We just asked that.

2855
03:32:47,896 --> 03:32:50,677
MATT: We previously established in the kraken
battle that you guys were able to cast spells

2856
03:32:50,677 --> 03:32:52,756
underwater. That continues here.

2857
03:32:52,756 --> 03:33:02,018
SAM: And I will, since I don't know where I am, I
will bamf to a place that I do know, which is--

2858
03:33:02,018 --> 03:33:10,798
where would I go? Let's go to the room across the
water over there.

2859
03:33:10,798 --> 03:33:13,166
MATT: Which room?

2860
03:33:13,166 --> 03:33:18,527
SAM: Right there, near the PacMan teleporter.
Yeah.

2861
03:33:18,527 --> 03:33:20,486
MATT: Okay. Inside the room?

2862
03:33:20,486 --> 03:33:22,298
SAM: Yeah, closer to the water's edge, but yes.

2863
03:33:22,298 --> 03:33:34,765
MATT: Okay, there we go. All right. At the end of
your turn, the field crushes in further. It's now

2864
03:33:34,765 --> 03:33:38,536
moving faster and faster, moving ten feet at a
time.

2865
03:33:38,536 --> 03:33:40,582
LIAM: This is the end.

2866
03:33:40,582 --> 03:33:44,156
TALIESIN: (singing) My only friend, the end.

2867
03:33:44,156 --> 03:33:54,601
MATT: Well no, the lightning towers would go off,
but they do not because they have been slowly

2868
03:33:54,601 --> 03:33:56,278
crushed and destroyed, eaten by the field.

2869
03:33:56,278 --> 03:33:59,338
MARISHA: The blue? Does that mean it skips?

2870
03:33:59,338 --> 03:34:07,459
LIAM: Yeah. I will use a bonus action to dump all
my Lay on Hands back into myself. So that's the

2871
03:34:07,459 --> 03:34:11,747
first thing. And I will--

2872
03:34:11,747 --> 03:34:13,574
MATT, TRAVIS, and TALIESIN: Bless you.

2873
03:34:13,574 --> 03:34:17,801
LIAM: You know, I will fucking stay put. Then I'll
tell you.

2874
03:34:17,801 --> 03:34:20,964
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, your turn.

2875
03:34:20,964 --> 03:34:24,933
MARISHA: It's my turn already? Okay.

2876
03:34:24,933 --> 03:34:29,333
MATT: The numbers are getting down and half the
party's just staying in place, doing nothing, so

2877
03:34:29,333 --> 03:34:30,629
your turn.

2878
03:34:30,629 --> 03:34:32,197
TRAVIS: Especially one of them.

2879
03:34:32,197 --> 03:34:35,192
MARISHA: Okay, I pop my head out of the water. Do
I see anybody?

2880
03:34:35,192 --> 03:34:39,040
MATT: Currently, no. You are alone on the
battlefield.

2881
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:45,696
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to switch to an earth
elemental. I'm going to come out of the water. I'm

2882
03:34:45,696 --> 03:34:50,437
going to walk over to the edge of the tower. I'm
going to be like, fuck whoever's in this shit! And

2883
03:34:50,437 --> 03:34:53,810
go boom, and start bringing this tower down with
my Siege Monster.

2884
03:34:53,810 --> 03:34:56,726
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack against the
tower.

2885
03:34:56,726 --> 03:35:02,379
MARISHA: Do I have to roll to hit still?

2886
03:35:02,379 --> 03:35:04,350
MATT: Yes, you do.

2887
03:35:04,350 --> 03:35:07,471
MARISHA: First attack, 14.

2888
03:35:07,471 --> 03:35:11,753
MATT: 14 hits. It's an easy-to-hit tower. Go ahead
and roll damage.

2889
03:35:11,753 --> 03:35:14,614
MARISHA: Okay, that's 2d8 plus five.

2890
03:35:14,614 --> 03:35:16,067
MATT: You get two slam attacks?

2891
03:35:16,067 --> 03:35:26,193
MARISHA: I do. That's 15, wait. Yes. 15 damage,
doubled, right? So 30? And then second attack.

2892
03:35:26,193 --> 03:35:34,458
Much better than that. It was a natural 12, so
plus eight. So 20.

2893
03:35:34,458 --> 03:35:36,405
MATT: Okay.

2894
03:35:36,405 --> 03:35:37,521
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2895
03:35:37,521 --> 03:35:48,640
MATT: So Percival, you feel this impact on the
tower. What's going on? (impact) As the back half

2896
03:35:48,640 --> 03:35:51,519
of it begins to crumble and collapse backwards.

2897
03:35:51,519 --> 03:35:56,504
TALIESIN: All right. I can't use any of my held
action to run, because that was not my intention.

2898
03:35:56,504 --> 03:36:06,340
MATT: No. This all begins to fall and crumble. Oh
man, this is going to be interesting. We'll say

2899
03:36:06,340 --> 03:36:10,522
for the purposes of this, I'll turn it this way.
Yeah, it's all falling apart at this point, which

2900
03:36:10,522 --> 03:36:11,853
works fine.

2901
03:36:11,853 --> 03:36:18,720
MARISHA: Fuck all y'all! I'm stupid and angry!

2902
03:36:18,720 --> 03:36:21,962
TALIESIN: Regardless, my reaction will be to run
away from where it's falling.

2903
03:36:21,962 --> 03:36:25,702
MATT: Yeah, this is all just falling down. There
is a little bit of this that's still hanging on

2904
03:36:25,702 --> 03:36:33,457
there. Large portion of the tower is collapsed and
is unusable. Percival, you crumble and slide off

2905
03:36:33,457 --> 03:36:34,875
and fall into the ground.

2906
03:36:34,875 --> 03:36:35,903
TALIESIN: Shoes.

2907
03:36:35,903 --> 03:36:41,016
MATT: I know. You're attaching to it as it falls
so go ahead-- Are you just staying onto it?

2908
03:36:41,016 --> 03:36:44,135
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm holding on for dear life.

2909
03:36:44,135 --> 03:36:48,796
MATT: All right. So you do not make an acrobatics
check and it crumbles beneath you. The rocks begin

2910
03:36:48,796 --> 03:36:52,658
to grind and tear into you as you fall in with
it.

2911
03:36:52,658 --> 03:36:56,015
TALIESIN: Okay, so I wouldn't try and dodge? I
don't get a dodge for any of that?

2912
03:36:56,172 --> 03:36:59,243
MATT: Not if you're adhering to it and it
collapses inward.

2913
03:36:59,243 --> 03:37:01,924
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean, I didn't know the situation.
I was just trying to be safe.

2914
03:37:01,924 --> 03:37:04,524
MATT: Okay. It's falling back and then crumbling
inwards.

2915
03:37:04,524 --> 03:37:05,677
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, no, no.

2916
03:37:05,677 --> 03:37:07,402
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

2917
03:37:07,402 --> 03:37:10,409
TALIESIN: Okay, sorry, yeah. I thought it was like
surfing.

2918
03:37:10,409 --> 03:37:12,519
MATT: You were for a moment, and then it all
collapsed.

2919
03:37:12,519 --> 03:37:18,289
TALIESIN: Acrobatics check? Come on. Oh yeah! 28!

2920
03:37:18,289 --> 03:37:26,601
MATT: 28? Okay, yeah. So you manage to only
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage and you

2921
03:37:26,601 --> 03:37:30,864
land, not prone, as you ride it down and are
standing there on the side, with an angry earth

2922
03:37:30,864 --> 03:37:32,828
elemental now slamming into the sides of it.

2923
03:37:32,828 --> 03:37:36,262
TALIESIN: 25 constitution saving throw.

2924
03:37:36,262 --> 03:37:43,496
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you do suffer 22 points of
bludgeoning damage from the tower pieces

2925
03:37:43,496 --> 03:37:48,871
collapsing down upon and around you. Reduced by
half, because you're an earth elemental.

2926
03:37:48,871 --> 03:37:50,595
TALIESIN: Do I see Vax at any point?

2927
03:37:50,595 --> 03:37:51,756
MATT: Nope.

2928
03:37:51,756 --> 03:37:53,285
TALIESIN: Do I see Scanlan at any point?

2929
03:37:53,285 --> 03:37:54,570
MATT: Nope.

2930
03:37:54,570 --> 03:37:55,531
TALIESIN: Okay.

2931
03:37:55,531 --> 03:37:58,638
MATT: Actually, yeah, you would see Scanlan.

2932
03:37:58,638 --> 03:37:59,864
TALIESIN: Can I take my shots?

2933
03:37:59,864 --> 03:38:01,389
MATT: Yeah.

2934
03:38:01,389 --> 03:38:02,530
TALIESIN: All right.

2935
03:38:02,530 --> 03:38:03,702
SAM: How many?

2936
03:38:03,702 --> 03:38:05,556
TALIESIN: Three. Four! Ha.

2937
03:38:05,556 --> 03:38:09,770
SAM: He sees me?! Through all that fucking
rubble?

2938
03:38:09,770 --> 03:38:13,505
MATT: Well, he rode it down to the ground and made
an acrobatics check to stop, and you're not

2939
03:38:13,505 --> 03:38:14,820
hidden.

2940
03:38:14,820 --> 03:38:16,481
SAM: I'm dead.

2941
03:38:16,481 --> 03:38:23,117
TALIESIN: First one is sharpshooter to hit. Nope.
I take damage.

2942
03:38:23,117 --> 03:38:25,102
MATT: A misfire?

2943
03:38:25,102 --> 03:38:26,071
TALIESIN: That's a misfire.

2944
03:38:26,071 --> 03:38:29,179
MATT: The first shot's a misfire. Scanlan, don't
give up yet.

2945
03:38:29,179 --> 03:38:36,421
TALIESIN: So that's four points of psychic damage
to me, because I have half saved. Add that.

2946
03:38:36,421 --> 03:38:45,655
That's 92 now, is what I'm at. And then, fuck
Animus. I'm going to the Retort gun for the

2947
03:38:45,655 --> 03:38:47,642
moment.

2948
03:38:47,642 --> 03:38:50,840
MATT: Okay, so you swap out to Retort. Second
attack.

2949
03:38:50,840 --> 03:38:56,421
MARISHA: Oh, boo!

2950
03:38:56,421 --> 03:38:58,296
TALIESIN: Retort's down.

2951
03:38:58,296 --> 03:39:02,443
MATT: He goes to fire, (fizzling). Pulls the
second gun, (misfire).

2952
03:39:02,443 --> 03:39:06,624
SAM: I hold up my gun and say, Need one,
motherfucker?

2953
03:39:06,624 --> 03:39:14,222
TALIESIN: I can't hear you. And I pull out my last
shot. This is my last shot because I've burned

2954
03:39:14,222 --> 03:39:15,318
everything.

2955
03:39:15,318 --> 03:39:16,489
MATT: This is Bad News?

2956
03:39:16,489 --> 03:39:22,608
TALIESIN: Yeah. And that's, come on, don't do this
to me. Oh, at least it's a hit. 19.

2957
03:39:22,608 --> 03:39:24,421
MATT: 19. Scanlan, what's your AC?

2958
03:39:24,421 --> 03:39:28,607
SAM: I'm going to Cutting Words that with my
little taunt and reduce it by--

2959
03:39:28,607 --> 03:39:30,545
TALIESIN: I can't hear him, but okay.

2960
03:39:30,545 --> 03:39:36,935
SAM: Oh, that's true. Never mind. Well, then I'll
Cutting Words the damage. You can do that, right?

2961
03:39:36,935 --> 03:39:41,277
MATT: I think the target of the attack has to be
the target of the Cutting Words. Because yeah, it

2962
03:39:41,277 --> 03:39:44,343
reduces the damage because you fuck with them.

2963
03:39:44,343 --> 03:39:46,039
SAM: Okay. Well, then you hit.

2964
03:39:46,039 --> 03:39:47,627
TALIESIN: It's not going to be a bad hit.

2965
03:39:47,627 --> 03:39:51,900
SAM: They're all bad hits. Massive hit.

2966
03:39:51,900 --> 03:39:54,211
MARISHA: That was so good!

2967
03:39:54,211 --> 03:39:58,728
TALIESIN: 29 points of damage.

2968
03:39:58,728 --> 03:40:05,492
MATT: You know what? "Use your wit to confuse-- a
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you

2969
03:40:05,492 --> 03:40:06,821
"makes an attack roll."

2970
03:40:06,821 --> 03:40:08,155
TALIESIN: Technically, I guess he could do a
visual thing.

2971
03:40:08,155 --> 03:40:11,880
MATT: I'll let you do it. So before you put the
damage down, go ahead and roll.

2972
03:40:11,880 --> 03:40:13,674
SAM: It's going to have to be a really good roll.

2973
03:40:13,674 --> 03:40:14,848
MATT: We'll see.

2974
03:40:14,848 --> 03:40:15,879
SAM: Nope.

2975
03:40:15,879 --> 03:40:16,963
MATT: It's a d12.

2976
03:40:16,963 --> 03:40:19,217
SAM: Oh, it's a d12! I've been doing d8s this
whole time!

2977
03:40:19,217 --> 03:40:20,549
MATT: d12, man.

2978
03:40:20,549 --> 03:40:22,175
TALIESIN: Oh, it's even worse!

2979
03:40:22,175 --> 03:40:23,324
SAM: One.

2980
03:40:23,324 --> 03:40:30,648
MATT: Yeah, so take the damage. The shot blasts
into your shoulder. You see the blood erupt from

2981
03:40:30,648 --> 03:40:32,818
you. You've been hit by this before.

2982
03:40:32,818 --> 03:40:35,352
SAM: Ow! Ow!

2983
03:40:35,352 --> 03:40:38,224
MARISHA: Did you not realize?

2984
03:40:38,224 --> 03:40:40,011
LIAM: I'm using a Sharpie, yeah.

2985
03:40:40,011 --> 03:40:43,361
TALIESIN: Too late now, anyway! Yeah, I know, it's
like, we might as well burn it. We're burning it.

2986
03:40:43,361 --> 03:40:47,654
MATT: Percival, that ends your turn? Scanlan.

2987
03:40:47,654 --> 03:40:49,738
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh, I mean, no, that's not my
turn. That was my reaction.

2988
03:40:49,738 --> 03:40:53,256
MATT: Right, because Keyleth brought it down.

2989
03:40:53,256 --> 03:40:56,523
TALIESIN: Yeah, so it's Keyleth's turn. Sorry.

2990
03:40:56,523 --> 03:40:59,247
MATT: Right, because you were waiting--

2991
03:40:59,247 --> 03:41:02,184
TALIESIN: I was holding my attack until I saw
people.

2992
03:41:02,184 --> 03:41:09,192
MATT: Right. Okay. So that brings us to the top of
the round. Percy, it's your turn.

2993
03:41:09,192 --> 03:41:10,984
SAM: What?! He can hold three attacks?

2994
03:41:10,984 --> 03:41:15,469
MATT: Well, he held his action to attack as soon
as he saw somebody, and he saw you and Keyleth. He

2995
03:41:15,469 --> 03:41:16,467
attacked you.

2996
03:41:16,467 --> 03:41:18,261
SAM: And one attack is three?

2997
03:41:18,261 --> 03:41:22,269
MATT: Four attacks. A 20th-level fighter, it's
their thing.

2998
03:41:22,269 --> 03:41:24,500
MARISHA: It's what fighters do.

2999
03:41:24,500 --> 03:41:27,515
TALIESIN: Just barely fixed my gun. Barely.

3000
03:41:27,515 --> 03:41:28,870
MATT: All right, so that's your action.

3001
03:41:28,870 --> 03:41:30,394
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to do an action
surge.

3002
03:41:30,394 --> 03:41:33,748
MATT: Okay. So you fixed which one? Animus?

3003
03:41:33,748 --> 03:41:36,844
SAM: He's going to shoot me eight times!

3004
03:41:36,844 --> 03:41:51,045
TALIESIN: Shot number one with grit, because I'm a
little nervous about this. 26. I didn't call

3005
03:41:51,045 --> 03:41:54,988
sharpshooter, so I'm just going to call that 31 to
hit.

3006
03:41:54,988 --> 03:41:56,884
MATT: Okay. That hits.

3007
03:41:56,884 --> 03:42:05,377
TALIESIN: That hits. 1d10 plus 1d6. That was
terrible. 11 points of damage.

3008
03:42:05,377 --> 03:42:06,837
SAM: Sure, yeah.

3009
03:42:06,837 --> 03:42:09,899
MATT: Next attack? Second?

3010
03:42:09,899 --> 03:42:21,829
TALIESIN: So I'm all out of grit now. That's nice.
Attack number two is 28.

3011
03:42:21,829 --> 03:42:23,984
MATT: Hits. Roll damage.

3012
03:42:23,984 --> 03:42:29,242
TALIESIN: Oh, that's better. 17 points of damage.

3013
03:42:29,242 --> 03:42:32,254
SAM: I will Cutting Words. Top of the round, I get
my reaction back.

3014
03:42:32,254 --> 03:42:33,585
MATT: It hasn't come back to your turn.

3015
03:42:33,585 --> 03:42:35,094
SAM: Then I'm dead.

3016
03:42:35,094 --> 03:42:38,776
MATT: Scanlan goes unconscious with that second
hit.

3017
03:42:38,776 --> 03:42:43,634
TALIESIN: Cool. I still have two attacks? I'm
going to take my movement to run over to him.

3018
03:42:43,634 --> 03:42:49,512
TRAVIS: Shove a healing potion in his mouth.

3019
03:42:49,512 --> 03:42:53,721
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can go?

3020
03:42:53,721 --> 03:42:56,038
MATT: It's water and you're walking through water
right now.

3021
03:42:56,038 --> 03:42:58,947
TALIESIN: That water freaks me out. I don't want
to quite step in that water.

3022
03:42:58,947 --> 03:43:03,256
MATT: So you could stay up, over here.

3023
03:43:03,256 --> 03:43:08,612
TALIESIN: Yeah, just over there. Keep me up on the
little bit because I don't want Keyleth to see me,

3024
03:43:08,612 --> 03:43:09,929
because she's scary.

3025
03:43:09,929 --> 03:43:13,395
MATT: I mean, she can see you. You're not hiding
from her. She's this giant behemoth.

3026
03:43:13,395 --> 03:43:17,101
TALIESIN: Okay, I would like to curl a little bit
then out of her range of vision.

3027
03:43:17,101 --> 03:43:20,597
MATT: You're out of movement right there. That's
as far as you will get.

3028
03:43:20,597 --> 03:43:21,951
MARISHA: I know exactly where you are.

3029
03:43:21,951 --> 03:43:23,095
TALIESIN: I know.

3030
03:43:23,095 --> 03:43:25,581
MATT: And she can sense it. She feels the
footfalls.

3031
03:43:25,581 --> 03:43:32,180
TALIESIN: I have two more shots? All right, I'm
taking a shot-- actually, unconscious, I don't get

3032
03:43:32,180 --> 03:43:38,235
grit back? It's death I get grit back. All right,
so, taking another-- but when he dies I get a

3033
03:43:38,235 --> 03:43:39,212
grit.

3034
03:43:39,212 --> 03:43:41,207
MATT: Okay. He's prone, technically, so you have
disadvantage on the attack.

3035
03:43:41,207 --> 03:43:47,990
TALIESIN: Oh, well then, hm. Fuck it, then. I'll
hold my attacks and use my bonus action to do a

3036
03:43:47,990 --> 03:43:49,521
heal.

3037
03:43:49,521 --> 03:43:50,678
SAM: On me?

3038
03:43:50,678 --> 03:43:51,671
TALIESIN: No, on me.

3039
03:43:51,671 --> 03:43:52,678
SAM: Aw.

3040
03:43:52,678 --> 03:43:57,454
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm done. I'm just getting my
1d10.

3041
03:43:57,454 --> 03:44:00,571
MATT: Scanlan, I need you to make a death saving
throw, please.

3042
03:44:00,571 --> 03:44:02,843
SAM: 17.

3043
03:44:02,843 --> 03:44:07,222
MATT: All right, so that's one success. Keep that
in mind. All right.

3044
03:44:07,222 --> 03:44:09,055
TALIESIN: 22 back.

3045
03:44:09,055 --> 03:44:17,850
MATT: The fields (crushing). Another ten feet. I'm
using this to mark how deep in it's getting now.

3046
03:44:17,850 --> 03:44:21,984
So we'll say there.

3047
03:44:21,984 --> 03:44:25,103
TALIESIN: So that's 194. I'm back up to 194.

3048
03:44:25,103 --> 03:44:36,480
MATT: Also, the water, which is now filled with
bits of broken stone, however still sets off.

3049
03:44:36,480 --> 03:44:37,994
TALIESIN: That's why I didn't step in it.

3050
03:44:37,994 --> 03:44:39,423
MARISHA: That's a good call.

3051
03:44:39,423 --> 03:44:41,600
MATT: That brings us to your turn.

3052
03:44:41,600 --> 03:44:47,282
LIAM: So from my hidden position, I would like to
use ten or 15 feet of movement, whatever I would

3053
03:44:47,282 --> 03:44:51,325
need to peek out and throw Whisper at Percival's
face.

3054
03:44:51,325 --> 03:44:52,952
TALIESIN: How would he even know where I am?

3055
03:44:52,952 --> 03:44:58,951
LIAM: Well, I would peek out. I'm looking around
and I know that I would see you. I was in here and

3056
03:44:58,951 --> 03:45:00,264
I'm hidden.

3057
03:45:00,264 --> 03:45:02,692
MATT: Well, you were hidden until you attacked,
which revealed you there.

3058
03:45:02,692 --> 03:45:04,612
LIAM: Isn't it a sneak attack from a hidden
position?

3059
03:45:04,612 --> 03:45:08,101
MATT: It is, but once you hit him, he sees you.
This is just for placement. I want to put you on

3060
03:45:08,101 --> 03:45:10,332
the field once or twice this battle!

3061
03:45:10,332 --> 03:45:17,148
LIAM: I know! So I'm using Whisper. That's good,
that's a 25 to hit.

3062
03:45:17,148 --> 03:45:18,475
TALIESIN: That hits.

3063
03:45:18,475 --> 03:45:28,353
LIAM: I'll bamf to him as I do it. It's sneak
attack damage. That is nine plus that is 11. Plus

3064
03:45:28,353 --> 03:45:29,707
all these guys.

3065
03:45:29,707 --> 03:45:31,272
TALIESIN: None of this is magic, is it?

3066
03:45:31,272 --> 03:45:33,103
LIAM: Some of it's psychic.

3067
03:45:33,103 --> 03:45:41,118
MATT: Unfortunately, all the big spellcasters are
either down or can't cast spells.

3068
03:45:41,118 --> 03:45:48,699
LIAM: That's 40 points of damage. And this is my
paladin attack, so that was one. I'm going to use

3069
03:45:48,699 --> 03:45:54,558
the other attack with Whisper, I've still got it,
to throw it at Keyleth's face. Which I will do.

3070
03:45:54,558 --> 03:46:08,940
That definitely hits. That is a 31. Right. So not
a lot of damage, though. (counting) That's 15 of

3071
03:46:08,940 --> 03:46:18,989
damage. That was maybe 15 feet of movement,
paladin attack-attack and I say: Oh!

3072
03:46:18,989 --> 03:46:21,520
MATT: Did you bamf to her as well?

3073
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:32,497
LIAM: Yeah. It really pains me. It really does. I
use bonus action to disengage. I have most of my

3074
03:46:32,497 --> 03:46:42,736
original movement and hasted action left.
Disengage. You guys don't know where I went.

3075
03:46:42,736 --> 03:46:43,901
MARISHA: You disengaged?

3076
03:46:43,901 --> 03:46:45,295
LIAM: Yeah.

3077
03:46:45,295 --> 03:46:53,159
SAM: You know what I would have done on the third
attack? First blood. You did a lot of nothing

3078
03:46:53,159 --> 03:46:55,269
damage to both of them and then hid.

3079
03:46:55,269 --> 03:46:57,482
MARISHA: Kind of.

3080
03:46:57,482 --> 03:47:02,945
MATT: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

3081
03:47:02,945 --> 03:47:06,019
MARISHA: Do I see Percy? Oh wait, I can feel him.

3082
03:47:06,019 --> 03:47:07,204
MATT: You can feel him, yes.

3083
03:47:07,204 --> 03:47:18,429
SAM: You'll never win, Vax! Scanlan from the
grave!

3084
03:47:18,429 --> 03:47:22,844
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out, by the way, I
don't think I've actually attacked you.

3085
03:47:22,844 --> 03:47:24,613
MARISHA: Me?

3086
03:47:24,613 --> 03:47:25,732
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just saying.

3087
03:47:25,732 --> 03:47:27,101
MARISHA: Are you thinking that's going to save
you?

3088
03:47:27,101 --> 03:47:27,989
TALIESIN: No.

3089
03:47:27,989 --> 03:47:28,946
MARISHA: Okay.

3090
03:47:28,946 --> 03:47:30,561
TALIESIN: I'm making plans.

3091
03:47:30,561 --> 03:47:36,260
MARISHA: What do I want to do with you?

3092
03:47:36,260 --> 03:47:38,272
TALIESIN: That is a question.

3093
03:47:38,272 --> 03:47:54,217
MARISHA: That is such a question. What's next?
Next is the fire, right? Oh. Hang on.

3094
03:47:54,217 --> 03:48:00,783
MATT: Keyleth, top of your turn. You feel two
footfalls very gently in the rubble on the other

3095
03:48:00,783 --> 03:48:02,735
side of the tower.

3096
03:48:02,735 --> 03:48:09,787
MARISHA: Can I make my way to them?

3097
03:48:09,787 --> 03:48:11,195
MATT: If you'd like to.

3098
03:48:11,195 --> 03:48:12,195
MARISHA: Yeah.

3099
03:48:12,195 --> 03:48:13,780
MATT: What's your movement here?

3100
03:48:13,780 --> 03:48:24,125
MARISHA: Here's the question. Since I know kind of
where he is, can I use my bonus action to turn

3101
03:48:24,125 --> 03:48:25,785
into a fire elemental and go to him?

3102
03:48:25,785 --> 03:48:26,857
MATT: Yeah.

3103
03:48:26,857 --> 03:48:32,117
MARISHA: I'm going to do that. My fire elemental
movement is 50 feet.

3104
03:48:32,117 --> 03:48:42,494
TALIESIN: She looks like she's about to fire a
mortar into a compound.

3105
03:48:42,494 --> 03:48:49,230
MATT: You, moving 50 feet, through the rubble,
since you can move through small spaces, right?

3106
03:48:49,230 --> 03:49:01,277
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Actually, shit, I didn't mean
fire. I meant water. If that's doable. It's fine.

3107
03:49:01,277 --> 03:49:02,504
I already called it.

3108
03:49:02,504 --> 03:49:04,361
MATT: If you want to do water elemental, you can.

3109
03:49:04,361 --> 03:49:05,703
MARISHA: No, I already called it.

3110
03:49:05,703 --> 03:49:26,964
MATT: Okay. Fire elemental. You (counting). Vax.
You were hiding up in the rubble.

3111
03:49:26,964 --> 03:49:31,038
LIAM: That's not where I am. I just sent it to
you. You asked me and I told you.

3112
03:49:31,038 --> 03:49:33,842
MATT: You sent me two pictures.

3113
03:49:33,842 --> 03:49:38,760
LIAM: You asked for clarification. I give it to
you. So no one would see me as you put me where I

3114
03:49:38,760 --> 03:49:41,615
am. Why would she be able to go in there?

3115
03:49:41,615 --> 03:49:45,024
MATT: She knows exactly where you are and as a
fire elemental, she can dodge between cracks.

3116
03:49:45,024 --> 03:49:46,370
LIAM: Did she run out of movement, though?

3117
03:49:46,370 --> 03:49:48,485
MARISHA: I have 50 feet, yo.

3118
03:49:48,485 --> 03:49:49,741
LIAM: Kill me.

3119
03:49:49,741 --> 03:49:53,349
MARISHA: So pouty!

3120
03:49:53,349 --> 03:49:55,222
LIAM: I knew it was going to happen!

3121
03:49:55,222 --> 03:50:02,737
MATT: As you're sitting there hiding, there's a
bright light and there's a slight crevasse between

3122
03:50:02,737 --> 03:50:09,372
the rocks as a flaming burst of fire elemental
Keyleth emerges to assault you. What're you

3123
03:50:09,372 --> 03:50:10,553
doing?

3124
03:50:10,553 --> 03:50:18,124
MARISHA: First, I'm going to enter your space
immediately and you take 1d10 fire damage and you

3125
03:50:18,124 --> 03:50:37,550
catch on fire. Seven damage. Two touch attacks.
I'm doing both attacks at once here. First attack

3126
03:50:37,550 --> 03:50:38,831
is 22.

3127
03:50:38,831 --> 03:50:40,381
LIAM: Nope.

3128
03:50:40,381 --> 03:50:43,716
MARISHA: Second attack doesn't hit either, then.

3129
03:50:43,716 --> 03:50:49,163
MATT: She swipes with one fire claw, you barely
dodge out of the way. A second one hits the stone

3130
03:50:49,163 --> 03:50:50,763
behind you as you duck low.

3131
03:50:50,763 --> 03:50:52,526
TALIESIN: But he's on fire.

3132
03:50:52,526 --> 03:50:53,952
MARISHA: But you're on fire.

3133
03:50:53,952 --> 03:50:56,102
LIAM: Tonight in this game.

3134
03:50:56,102 --> 03:50:57,619
MARISHA: Do I have any more movement?

3135
03:50:57,619 --> 03:51:00,623
MATT: It took you most of your movement to get there.
You have five feet of movement.

3136
03:51:00,623 --> 03:51:05,794
MARISHA: Can I move through this crack on the
other side here?

3137
03:51:05,794 --> 03:51:09,112
MATT: I'll allow it.

3138
03:51:09,112 --> 03:51:11,540
MARISHA: Sorry, boom mics.

3139
03:51:11,540 --> 03:51:31,005
MATT: With the rubble and everything in here... Ending
Keyleth's turn, Percival, you're up.

3140
03:51:31,005 --> 03:51:35,662
TALIESIN: I'm making a mad dash for Scanlan.

3141
03:51:35,662 --> 03:51:44,136
MATT: Okay. (counting)

3142
03:51:44,136 --> 03:51:47,078
TALIESIN: I can't make a jump to see if I can
get a little further across there?

3143
03:51:47,078 --> 03:51:48,174
MATT: What's your strength?

3144
03:51:48,174 --> 03:51:50,457
TALIESIN: My strength sucks. My strength is 12.

3145
03:51:50,457 --> 03:51:58,852
MATT: You jump and land. You're up to your chest
in water.

3146
03:51:58,852 --> 03:52:02,204
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the rest of my action
to continue to run towards Scanlan.

3147
03:52:02,204 --> 03:52:04,008
MATT: You're going to use an action to dash?

3148
03:52:04,008 --> 03:52:09,901
TALIESIN: Use an action to dash. Can I get a
little further, or is that as far as I can get?

3149
03:52:09,901 --> 03:52:12,122
MATT: Maybe five more feet.

3150
03:52:12,122 --> 03:52:14,577
TALIESIN: I want to be on the other side of him,
if that's okay.

3151
03:52:14,577 --> 03:52:17,233
MATT: You can get to there.

3152
03:52:17,233 --> 03:52:18,557
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3153
03:52:18,557 --> 03:52:20,720
MATT: That's your turn?

3154
03:52:20,720 --> 03:52:21,712
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

3155
03:52:21,712 --> 03:52:23,860
MATT: Scanlan. Death saving throw.

3156
03:52:23,860 --> 03:52:25,078
SAM: 11.

3157
03:52:25,078 --> 03:52:35,693
MATT: You're fine. That's two successes. The field
crushes in further. Slowly pushing in. At this

3158
03:52:35,693 --> 03:52:38,497
point, by the way, so you're aware, Percival.

3159
03:52:38,497 --> 03:52:40,672
TALIESIN: I thought I had a little bit of room.

3160
03:52:40,672 --> 03:52:50,607
MATT: You have a little bit, this whole chamber.
Let me use this to mark it here. That's where it's

3161
03:52:50,607 --> 03:52:56,522
closing in. Closer and closer. Vax, your turn.

3162
03:52:56,522 --> 03:52:58,918
MARISHA: Wait, when is it the top of the round?

3163
03:52:58,918 --> 03:53:01,744
MATT: It just went. That was Percival.

3164
03:53:01,744 --> 03:53:03,388
MARISHA: Did the torches go, or no?

3165
03:53:03,388 --> 03:53:09,770
MATT: No, they go after Scanlan's turn, now, the
field. You're right. Thank you for the reminder.

3166
03:53:09,770 --> 03:53:11,755
TALIESIN: Hey, look at that!

3167
03:53:11,755 --> 03:53:13,523
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm totally helping the DM.

3168
03:53:13,523 --> 03:53:15,510
TALIESIN: No, you're killing Vax! Well done!

3169
03:53:15,510 --> 03:53:26,942
MATT: Valid point. The area around the tower
ignites in flame. You're immune to fire, Keyleth.

3170
03:53:26,942 --> 03:53:29,240
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

3171
03:53:29,240 --> 03:53:37,493
LIAM: Right. I get advantage. 29.

3172
03:53:37,493 --> 03:53:40,895
MATT: That's a success. You take no damage because
of evasion.

3173
03:53:40,895 --> 03:53:43,027
MARISHA: Ballsacks.

3174
03:53:43,027 --> 03:53:45,436
LIAM: Is it my turn?

3175
03:53:45,436 --> 03:53:48,423
MATT: Your turn.

3176
03:53:48,423 --> 03:53:50,863
LIAM: I'm separated with a wall from her a
little bit.

3177
03:53:50,863 --> 03:53:53,554
MATT: Slight gap in the wall.

3178
03:53:53,554 --> 03:53:58,891
LIAM: I'm going to skitter five or ten feet. I
know she can hear me, but he can't. Then I'm going

3179
03:53:58,891 --> 03:54:04,439
to use a little more movement. This looks like a
hole, so I'll floof out to about here. I'll

3180
03:54:04,439 --> 03:54:12,867
paladin attack-attack Percival from the air over
the water. Yeah. Oh, that's not very good. That's

3181
03:54:12,867 --> 03:54:14,039
18.

3182
03:54:14,039 --> 03:54:15,558
TALIESIN: That's my armor class.

3183
03:54:15,558 --> 03:54:21,580
LIAM: Hits. The second attack is not, so it
doesn't hit, but the first one does and it's sneak

3184
03:54:21,580 --> 03:54:42,046
attack. That's 18 plus these guys. Here we go.
(counting) 40.

3185
03:54:42,046 --> 03:54:44,124
MATT: 40 points of piercing damage to you.

3186
03:54:44,124 --> 03:54:50,091
LIAM: One attack hit, one missed. I used bonus
action to hide, a little bit of movement to get

3187
03:54:50,091 --> 03:54:54,481
here, attack-attack. So I have hasted action and a
lot more movement left. I'll use the rest of my

3188
03:54:54,481 --> 03:55:00,567
base movement to go. I will tell you where I'm
going.

3189
03:55:00,567 --> 03:55:02,263
SAM: You're going to heal me.

3190
03:55:02,263 --> 03:55:03,568
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

3191
03:55:03,568 --> 03:55:07,476
MATT: Ending Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

3192
03:55:07,476 --> 03:55:36,534
MARISHA: Okay. Blue, that's gone. I know he's
around here somewhere, yeah? Over around this side.

3193
03:55:36,534 --> 03:55:39,527
MATT: Yes. You felt a little (clicking).

3194
03:55:39,527 --> 03:55:46,427
MARISHA: Can I jump into the water and swim around
as a water elemental and see if I can get to this

3195
03:55:46,427 --> 03:55:47,927
other side?

3196
03:55:47,927 --> 03:55:53,612
MATT: You turn into a water elemental.

3197
03:55:53,612 --> 03:56:07,836
MARISHA: This might not be the best call. If I get
around here, can I poke my head up and see if I

3198
03:56:07,836 --> 03:56:09,409
find him?

3199
03:56:09,409 --> 03:56:11,376
MATT: I have to wait to find out.

3200
03:56:11,376 --> 03:56:17,001
MARISHA: I just projected where I was going to be,
though, he could just change his fucking mind!

3201
03:56:17,001 --> 03:56:20,182
LIAM: He projected my position four times tonight.
It's just the nature of the game, man.

3202
03:56:20,182 --> 03:56:21,624
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3203
03:56:21,624 --> 03:56:38,235
MARISHA: Don't sext him while you're at it!
Jesus!

3204
03:56:38,235 --> 03:56:45,693
SAM: The new campaign will be all texts.

3205
03:56:45,693 --> 03:56:50,518
MATT: Never mind. You felt no (clicking). Instead,
he just disappeared from sight. You saw him go

3206
03:56:50,518 --> 03:56:54,407
this direction, but you have no idea where he is.
Do you want to remain fire elemental?

3207
03:56:54,407 --> 03:57:03,374
MARISHA: Well, I was jumping into water elemental
to go around, but if I don't feel him land, then

3208
03:57:03,374 --> 03:57:10,967
I'll go earth elemental. Let me start stomping up
and over and seeing what I see.

3209
03:57:10,967 --> 03:57:15,362
MATT: Sure. I'll let you step up over rough
terrain.

3210
03:57:15,362 --> 03:57:17,181
MARISHA: (grumbling)

3211
03:57:17,181 --> 03:57:19,373
MATT: Dashing through.

3212
03:57:19,373 --> 03:57:23,091
MARISHA: Okay. Do I see anything? Do I see any flying
asshole rogues?

3213
03:57:23,091 --> 03:57:27,170
MATT: You don't see anything.

3214
03:57:27,170 --> 03:57:29,279
LIAM: It's my only mechanic.

3215
03:57:29,279 --> 03:57:31,141
MATT: Percival.

3216
03:57:31,141 --> 03:57:33,767
MARISHA: It's a good mechanic!

3217
03:57:33,767 --> 03:57:39,727
TALIESIN: This is probably the best use of this.
I'm going to use my action surge. I'm going to

3218
03:57:39,727 --> 03:57:44,491
hold my action, but I'm going to use my action
surge. I can use an action surge instead of

3219
03:57:44,491 --> 03:57:49,305
holding my action. Just to stab this fucker three
times.

3220
03:57:49,305 --> 03:57:51,457
MARISHA: Brutal!

3221
03:57:51,457 --> 03:57:57,442
MATT: The first attack. Roll an attack with
advantage because he's on the ground.

3222
03:57:57,442 --> 03:58:00,170
SAM: I'm prone. I get half!

3223
03:58:00,170 --> 03:58:02,861
MATT: Only against ranged attacks.

3224
03:58:02,861 --> 03:58:07,165
TALIESIN: 29.

3225
03:58:07,165 --> 03:58:10,928
MATT: That hits. It's an auto-crit. You fail two
death saving throws.

3226
03:58:10,928 --> 03:58:17,594
TALIESIN: Here goes the second one. 29.

3227
03:58:17,594 --> 03:58:20,637
MATT: And with that, you shank Scanlan.

3228
03:58:20,637 --> 03:58:22,636
TALIESIN: Oh look, I get a grit back.

3229
03:58:22,636 --> 03:58:26,358
MATT: Scanlan bleeds out.

3230
03:58:26,358 --> 03:58:28,629
SAM: Who will tell my story?

3231
03:58:28,629 --> 03:58:31,149
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Not me.

3232
03:58:31,149 --> 03:58:34,026
TALIESIN: I'm not proud of this. I'm never telling
anyone. I'm like: I don't know, he ran off. I am

3233
03:58:34,026 --> 03:58:48,224
going to move out into this direction over here
because I know the walls are caving in. I have 30

3234
03:58:48,224 --> 03:58:56,364
movement. I'm going to move right over here to
start getting out of the way.

3235
03:58:56,364 --> 03:58:57,854
MATT: Over where?

3236
03:58:57,854 --> 03:58:59,089
TALIESIN: Around the corner.

3237
03:58:59,089 --> 03:59:00,623
MATT: The wall's up against there.

3238
03:59:00,623 --> 03:59:14,078
TALIESIN: In that case, I'll head that direction.
(counting) I'm holding my action for the second I

3239
03:59:14,078 --> 03:59:16,833
see anyone start to fuck with me.

3240
03:59:16,833 --> 03:59:18,339
MATT: You already used your action.

3241
03:59:18,339 --> 03:59:22,257
TALIESIN: That was my action surge.

3242
03:59:22,257 --> 03:59:25,404
MATT: Oh. Action surge first. You hold your action
in case you see anything.

3243
03:59:25,404 --> 03:59:26,650
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

3244
03:59:26,650 --> 03:59:28,282
TALIESIN: I can do a lot of damage now.

3245
03:59:28,282 --> 03:59:29,828
MATT: End of Percival's turn.

3246
03:59:29,828 --> 03:59:33,206
TALIESIN: Just have to bet that I can plow
damage.

3247
03:59:33,206 --> 03:59:42,360
MATT: The water bursts with magical energy. No, it
was fire last time, so now it's lightning. Blue

3248
03:59:42,360 --> 03:59:55,653
things are gone, nothing happens. Also, it crushes
in once more. Bringing us to there. Currently, the

3249
03:59:55,653 --> 03:59:59,240
walls have crushed in.

3250
03:59:59,240 --> 04:00:13,197
TALIESIN: I always knew it would be the three of
us.

3251
04:00:13,197 --> 04:00:14,907
SAM: You did?

3252
04:00:14,907 --> 04:00:16,783
TALIESIN: No. I just always wanted to say that.

3253
04:00:16,783 --> 04:00:18,469
LIAM: You always said it would be Grog and
Keyleth.

3254
04:00:18,525 --> 04:00:20,637
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought it was going to be
me and Grog again.

3255
04:00:20,637 --> 04:00:22,971
TRAVIS: With all the magic that I have?

3256
04:00:22,971 --> 04:00:24,341
TALIESIN: If you had gotten your hands on
anybody--

3257
04:00:24,341 --> 04:00:27,984
MARISHA: Yeah, if you had closed the gap, that's
it. That's down for any of us.

3258
04:00:27,984 --> 04:00:30,927
TRAVIS: Disengage. Shift. Element. You just (poof)
right out of it.

3259
04:00:30,927 --> 04:00:35,540
TALIESIN: And also, can I mention, isn't he still
on fire? Make it harder to--

3260
04:00:35,540 --> 04:00:37,633
LIAM: Matt. One.

3261
04:00:37,633 --> 04:00:45,108
MATT: One. Okay. So, couple things. One, roll 1d10
fire damage, Marisha, by the way.

3262
04:00:45,108 --> 04:00:47,732
TALIESIN: Thank you. Lead him out.

3263
04:00:47,732 --> 04:00:51,344
MARISHA: Nine.

3264
04:00:51,344 --> 04:00:53,150
MATT: Technically twice, since you didn't do it
last turn, right?

3265
04:00:53,150 --> 04:00:54,695
LIAM: I was about to say, I didn't stop drop and
roll or anything. Literally about to say.

3266
04:00:54,695 --> 04:00:55,880
MATT: It's an action to put it out.

3267
04:00:55,880 --> 04:00:56,860
LIAM: Yeah, so I didn't do it.

3268
04:00:56,860 --> 04:00:58,011
MATT: So, nine fire damage, and then roll again.

3269
04:00:58,011 --> 04:01:01,407
MARISHA: So nine now, and then another four. So,
13.

3270
04:01:01,407 --> 04:01:02,481
LIAM: 13. Got it.

3271
04:01:02,481 --> 04:01:06,190
MATT: And then you fail your constitution saving
throw as the wall slams into you, pushing you

3272
04:01:06,190 --> 04:01:23,173
back. Oof. You take 28 points of force damage, and
you are thrown, prone onto the ground right

3273
04:01:23,173 --> 04:01:24,100
there.

3274
04:01:24,100 --> 04:01:25,164
LIAM: Great.

3275
04:01:25,164 --> 04:01:29,182
MATT: That ends that turn. Vax, your turn.

3276
04:01:29,182 --> 04:01:32,676
LIAM: Okay. I will use movement to get up.

3277
04:01:32,676 --> 04:01:34,010
MATT: Half your movement.

3278
04:01:34,010 --> 04:01:39,216
LIAM: Half my, 60 feet of movement to stand up,
got it. And I will fly low along the ground--

3279
04:01:39,216 --> 04:01:40,606
MATT: Also Vax--

3280
04:01:40,606 --> 04:01:43,710
LIAM: Are the boots off?

3281
04:01:43,710 --> 04:01:45,396
MATT: The boots are off.

3282
04:01:45,396 --> 04:01:51,206
LIAM: Okay. So it's not 60, the wings are up, so
30 feet to get up.

3283
04:01:51,206 --> 04:01:52,669
MATT: Correct.

3284
04:01:52,669 --> 04:01:55,745
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

3285
04:01:55,745 --> 04:02:06,065
LIAM: 30 feet to get about-- I don't know, can I
perch there? Flying low? I should be within 60

3286
04:02:06,065 --> 04:02:16,489
feet of Kiki, and I have Vow of Enmity still, so I
will attack-attack-attack.

3287
04:02:16,489 --> 04:02:21,885
MATT: Yeah, you can barely see her. You just
barely have her in range. Percy. You watch as he

3288
04:02:21,885 --> 04:02:23,091
glides in the air--

3289
04:02:23,091 --> 04:02:24,604
TALIESIN: Oh, hey, I got a shot!

3290
04:02:24,604 --> 04:02:28,838
LIAM: This is here, this is here. There's a gap
there?

3291
04:02:28,838 --> 04:02:30,919
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you wouldn't have flown up to
your perch.

3292
04:02:30,919 --> 04:02:32,445
LIAM: Okay.

3293
04:02:32,445 --> 04:02:33,833
TALIESIN: I will take my shot.

3294
04:02:33,833 --> 04:02:36,439
MARISAH: Out of the shadows, boy!

3295
04:02:36,439 --> 04:02:37,990
LIAM: Everybody hates me.

3296
04:02:37,990 --> 04:02:40,080
MATT: Everybody hates each other!

3297
04:02:40,080 --> 04:02:42,805
TALIESIN: First shot.

3298
04:02:42,805 --> 04:02:49,513
MARISHA: As the internet said earlier, we're really bad at
shit-talking each other. Just embrace it.

3299
04:02:49,513 --> 04:02:52,385
TALIESIN: First shot, I'm burning my grit for a
Sharpshooter.

3300
04:02:52,385 --> 04:02:54,421
MATT: She's been Feebleminded! Don't play Woe is
Me!

3301
04:02:54,421 --> 04:02:56,355
TALIESIN: Going to burn my grit for a Sharpshooter
in hopes of really doing some damage.

3302
04:02:56,355 --> 04:02:58,919
MATT: He got Plane Shifted, he got shanked by
Percival! You're doing all right!

3303
04:02:58,919 --> 04:03:01,288
TRAVIS: First time we've seen you in three hours and 45
minutes.

3304
04:03:01,352 --> 04:03:02,966
TALIESIN: 25 to hit.

3305
04:03:02,966 --> 04:03:06,102
LIAM: That probably hits a lot.

3306
04:03:06,102 --> 04:03:07,610
SAM: First blood!

3307
04:03:07,610 --> 04:03:21,407
TALIESIN: Here, I'm using good dice for this. Oh
yeah. 28 plus six psychic, so 34 points of

3308
04:03:21,407 --> 04:03:22,555
damage.

3309
04:03:22,555 --> 04:03:24,693
LIAM: I can use Uncanny Dodge on that, since I can
see him if he can see me.

3310
04:03:24,693 --> 04:03:25,925
MATT: Correct.

3311
04:03:25,925 --> 04:03:27,212
LIAM: So, half that.

3312
04:03:27,212 --> 04:03:28,452
TALIESIN: Half of 34.

3313
04:03:28,452 --> 04:03:34,578
MATT: That would be 17. Next attack?

3314
04:03:34,578 --> 04:03:35,978
TALIESIN: Next attack.

3315
04:03:35,978 --> 04:03:37,254
MARISHA: Kill him!

3316
04:03:37,254 --> 04:03:45,779
TALIESIN: Oh, goddamn it. Animus is down. That was
a 20. Bad News comes out. That's a third attack.

3317
04:03:45,779 --> 04:03:48,050
Come on, Gil.

3318
04:03:48,050 --> 04:03:50,414
MARISHA: Is that a crit?

3319
04:03:50,414 --> 04:03:51,669
TALIESIN: No, it's not a crit.

3320
04:03:51,669 --> 04:03:52,830
MARISHA: Damn it, so close.

3321
04:03:52,830 --> 04:03:55,522
TALIESIN: That's a 27 to hit.

3322
04:03:55,522 --> 04:03:56,863
LIAM: Yeah, you're good.

3323
04:03:56,863 --> 04:03:58,992
TALIESIN: Where are my dice for that?

3324
04:03:58,992 --> 04:04:02,429
MARISHA: Not that I'm cheering on for your death
or anything.

3325
04:04:02,429 --> 04:04:03,451
LIAM: Yes, you are.

3326
04:04:03,451 --> 04:04:06,100
MARISHA: I'm just excited. I'm excitable.

3327
04:04:06,100 --> 04:04:07,951
TALIESIN: That's 26 points of damage.

3328
04:04:07,951 --> 04:04:09,649
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage.

3329
04:04:09,649 --> 04:04:12,035
TALIESIN: I can't use a bonus to reload, can I?

3330
04:04:12,035 --> 04:04:13,703
MATT: Nope. Not your turn.

3331
04:04:13,703 --> 04:04:15,249
TALIESIN: So I just reloaded. All right.

3332
04:04:15,249 --> 04:04:18,787
MATT: So your last attack is to reload.

3333
04:04:18,787 --> 04:04:21,594
SAM: I cast Slowly Decompose.

3334
04:04:21,594 --> 04:04:25,034
TRAVIS: I cast Waterlogged.

3335
04:04:25,034 --> 04:04:27,229
MATT: Okay, so now you land there, and can make
your attacks on him.

3336
04:04:27,229 --> 04:04:29,169
LIAM: It's still my turn. Oh, wow, that's
amazing.

3337
04:04:29,169 --> 04:04:30,585
MATT: Yep. That was his reaction.

3338
04:04:30,585 --> 04:04:44,793
LIAM: Dagger dagger dagger. Yeah, that's a 30 to
hit. Oh, it doesn't matter, because I've got Vow

3339
04:04:44,793 --> 04:04:48,117
of Enmity up. I was going to say am I still
hidden, but I've got Vow of Enmity. That is sneak

3340
04:04:48,117 --> 04:04:50,097
attack on that. That's 30.

3341
04:04:50,097 --> 04:04:55,033
MARISHA: Oh, Scanlan! We could have been pit
fiends together! But I got Feebleminded! Oh no!

3342
04:04:55,033 --> 04:04:58,288
And you died! We waited too long!

3343
04:04:58,288 --> 04:05:00,713
MATT: I had these minions at the ready, just in
case!

3344
04:05:00,713 --> 04:05:01,918
SAM: Aww!

3345
04:05:01,918 --> 04:05:03,510
MARISHA: We were going to be awesome!

3346
04:05:03,510 --> 04:05:05,129
TRAVIS: That would've been fun.

3347
04:05:05,129 --> 04:05:11,702
MATT: I know. Pit fiend on a full melee round
against a single target can do an average of 115

3348
04:05:11,702 --> 04:05:14,461
hit points of damage and lock down healing.

3349
04:05:14,461 --> 04:05:16,100
LIAM: 44 on the first.

3350
04:05:16,100 --> 04:05:17,244
MARISHA: Damage?

3351
04:05:17,244 --> 04:05:22,696
LIAM: 44 damage on the first? Does 18 hit?

3352
04:05:22,696 --> 04:05:25,858
MARISHA: Yes. Pretty much everything hits these
motherfuckers.

3353
04:05:25,858 --> 04:05:44,390
LIAM: You get ten on that. 28 on the third, also
hits. That is 12 on the third.

3354
04:05:44,390 --> 04:05:49,311
MATT: You've used all your movement.

3355
04:05:49,311 --> 04:05:54,888
LIAM: Yeah, I'm done because I'm not hasted any
more. I used half to stand up and the other half

3356
04:05:54,888 --> 04:06:02,322
to get there. I used-- it's complicated, folks.
Paladin attack-attack and bonus to do a third

3357
04:06:02,322 --> 04:06:03,533
attack. So I'm done.

3358
04:06:03,533 --> 04:06:06,450
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

3359
04:06:06,450 --> 04:06:20,115
MARISHA: All right! Let's dance! I jump. As I
jump, I'm going to turn into a water elemental.

3360
04:06:20,115 --> 04:06:25,382
Ker-splash. Then use my movement speed to
come up. I'm going to try to whelm Vax.

3361
04:06:25,382 --> 04:06:29,736
MATT: A leap there would be 20 feet of movement.

3362
04:06:29,736 --> 04:06:32,132
MARISHA: With my dope mantle.

3363
04:06:32,132 --> 04:06:36,386
LIAM: She's not so dumb that she thinks she's an
earth elemental forever?

3364
04:06:36,386 --> 04:06:41,180
MARISHA: I'm an archdruid!

3365
04:06:41,180 --> 04:06:44,850
LIAM: You have an intelligence of one.

3366
04:06:44,850 --> 04:06:49,344
MATT: Marisha, technically your mantle isn't on
you right now because you're in elemental form.

3367
04:06:49,344 --> 04:06:54,262
MARISHA: Beast Shape says that anything that's on
me absorbs into me.

3368
04:06:54,262 --> 04:06:55,515
MATT: Absorbs into your form.

3369
04:06:55,515 --> 04:06:58,521
MARISHA: And elemental is my form.

3370
04:06:58,521 --> 04:07:04,225
MATT: But you're not getting your ring of
protection bonus, you're not getting your other

3371
04:07:04,225 --> 04:07:07,529
elements that you have in physical form. They stay
within you so when you transform back, the effects

3372
04:07:07,529 --> 04:07:12,336
return, but you don't get the Jump ability. What's
the strength of this guy?

3373
04:07:12,336 --> 04:07:15,813
MARISHA: 20 strength.

3374
04:07:15,813 --> 04:07:17,137
MATT: Oh yeah.

3375
04:07:17,137 --> 04:07:19,713
LIAM: Suddenly, five rules lawyers around the
table.

3376
04:07:19,713 --> 04:07:30,680
MATT: Water elemental there. I'll say half your
movement to get into the water, the jump. Turn

3377
04:07:30,680 --> 04:07:32,062
into a water elemental.

3378
04:07:32,062 --> 04:07:33,185
MARISHA: How much speed do I have left?

3379
04:07:33,185 --> 04:07:34,297
MATT: Half of your swim speed.

3380
04:07:34,297 --> 04:07:36,291
MARISHA: So 45. Can I get to Vax?

3381
04:07:36,291 --> 04:07:41,087
MATT: (counting)

3382
04:07:41,087 --> 04:07:42,709
LIAM: Oh, difficult terrain!

3383
04:07:42,709 --> 04:07:45,190
MARISHA: I can swim! I'm a fucking water
elemental!

3384
04:07:45,190 --> 04:07:48,430
MATT: You're just in melee range with him.

3385
04:07:48,430 --> 04:07:53,969
MARISHA: Blub blub blub! Whelm again.

3386
04:07:53,969 --> 04:07:56,353
MATT: Do you have to move into his space for
whelm?

3387
04:07:56,353 --> 04:08:03,798
MARISHA: Each creature in the elemental's space.
So yes.

3388
04:08:03,798 --> 04:08:05,720
MATT: He's unfortunately just out.

3389
04:08:05,720 --> 04:08:09,953
MARISHA: Then I'll do my two slam attacks. Bam
bam.

3390
04:08:09,953 --> 04:08:11,732
TALIESIN: He's low, man.

3391
04:08:11,732 --> 04:08:14,474
MATT: You're just out of range for being whelmed,
so that's good.

3392
04:08:14,474 --> 04:08:20,298
SAM: Weirdly, taking away all of Keyleth's
intelligence has made her a more effective

3393
04:08:20,298 --> 04:08:21,608
fighter.

3394
04:08:21,608 --> 04:08:31,323
MARISHA: 20. Misses. I've got to roll high in
order to actually get you. That's even better!

3395
04:08:31,323 --> 04:08:32,526
25!

3396
04:08:32,526 --> 04:08:34,210
MATT: Roll damage.

3397
04:08:34,210 --> 04:08:45,418
MARISHA: Roll, baby! 17 points of damage.

3398
04:08:45,418 --> 04:08:46,969
LIAM: Uncanny dodge.

3399
04:08:46,969 --> 04:08:48,993
TRAVIS: So casual.

3400
04:08:48,993 --> 04:08:53,595
MATT: You take eight points of bludgeoning damage
from the water.

3401
04:08:53,595 --> 04:08:57,461
MARISHA: Okay. That's it.

3402
04:08:57,461 --> 04:09:00,978
MATT: That brings us to Percival.

3403
04:09:00,978 --> 04:09:09,325
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix my gun with my
roll.

3404
04:09:09,325 --> 04:09:12,424
MATT: This is your action.

3405
04:09:12,424 --> 04:09:15,218
TALIESIN: And boy that does it.

3406
04:09:15,218 --> 04:09:19,685
SAM: It's so fixed.

3407
04:09:19,685 --> 04:09:27,863
TALIESIN: Sometimes it'll really break. I'm going
to make my way up on top of that tower.

3408
04:09:27,863 --> 04:09:29,430
MATT: Right there?

3409
04:09:29,430 --> 04:09:30,906
TALIESIN: Yeah. A little closer.

3410
04:09:30,906 --> 04:09:35,528
MATT: Just so you know, the force field is right
there.

3411
04:09:35,528 --> 04:09:41,617
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind. I thought it was a
little further back. I'm going to try to cross the

3412
04:09:41,617 --> 04:09:44,382
water and get back to the other side of the water
again.

3413
04:09:44,382 --> 04:09:51,092
MATT: (counting) Right there.

3414
04:09:51,092 --> 04:09:55,417
TALIESIN: That'll do it. Just let the two of them
settle their differences.

3415
04:09:55,417 --> 04:10:02,319
MARISHA: Not a bad call.

3416
04:10:02,319 --> 04:10:10,850
MATT: Now, the energy fields burst with purple
energy.

3417
04:10:10,850 --> 04:10:12,688
MARISHA: Was so hoping I was going to have Vax in
that water.

3418
04:10:12,688 --> 04:10:19,532
MATT: Actually, they don't! They've been destroyed
by the fields, so they do not have an effect any more.

3419
04:10:19,532 --> 04:10:21,895
MARISHA: It's just us kids.

3420
04:10:21,895 --> 04:10:31,045
MATT: Which saves you because that would have
knocked out your form. However, the fields move in

3421
04:10:31,045 --> 04:10:34,001
further, completely destroying this here.

3422
04:10:34,001 --> 04:10:35,855
TALIESIN: I am so excited by this.

3423
04:10:35,855 --> 04:10:37,859
LIAM: I'm going to be dead. I'm a dead man.

3424
04:10:37,859 --> 04:10:52,397
MATT: This all goes away. Just the edge of the
water now. We're in on this area now. Vax, it's

3425
04:10:52,397 --> 04:10:53,469
your turn.

3426
04:10:53,469 --> 04:10:58,462
LIAM: I would like to paladin attack Keyleth with
Vow of Enmity twice. The first one is a natural

3427
04:10:58,462 --> 04:11:16,721
20. Let's just calculate that, shall we? That's
one. Get all the dice first. (counting) Not that

3428
04:11:16,721 --> 04:11:22,519
great, actually. That is 58 for the first attack.

3429
04:11:22,519 --> 04:11:24,906
MATT: 58 damage to your water elemental.

3430
04:11:24,906 --> 04:11:35,690
MARISHA: Wait, is that magical? No, it's straight
damage, right?

3431
04:11:35,690 --> 04:11:39,199
LIAM: Eight psychic and double on all the dice.

3432
04:11:39,199 --> 04:11:44,615
MATT: Magical dagger attacks, so you do not
resist.

3433
04:11:44,615 --> 04:11:46,323
MARISHA: What was the first one, 56?

3434
04:11:46,323 --> 04:11:47,571
LIAM: 58.

3435
04:11:47,571 --> 04:12:11,509
MARISHA: That's not right, either! No, that is
right.

3436
04:12:11,509 --> 04:12:13,178
MATT: You can't see Percival.

3437
04:12:13,178 --> 04:12:17,128
MARISHA: What was the other one?

3438
04:12:17,128 --> 04:12:18,912
LIAM: 14.

3439
04:12:18,912 --> 04:12:24,937
SAM: Can't be done! Don't you get it? The math's
not there! You have to deliver more than 200

3440
04:12:24,937 --> 04:12:31,783
points of damage in a single round to kill her!
You can't do it without us! The math is not

3441
04:12:31,783 --> 04:12:33,112
there!

3442
04:12:33,112 --> 04:12:35,761
LIAM: So that was paladin attack-attack. I'll use
disengage.

3443
04:12:35,761 --> 04:12:41,465
TRAVIS: Fly into the wall. Do it. Burn yourself
up, every inch.

3444
04:12:41,465 --> 04:12:48,472
LIAM: I don't want to do the phone thing. I'm going
to fly 60 feet, but Percy doesn't see me. She

3445
04:12:48,472 --> 04:12:59,289
does. I fly to about here. 60 feet. I'm on the
other side of this tower.

3446
04:12:59,289 --> 04:13:01,299
MATT: You disengaged from her.

3447
04:13:01,299 --> 04:13:03,270
LIAM: Disengage and then my movement of 60 feet.

3448
04:13:03,270 --> 04:13:10,300
MATT: All right. That ends Vax's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

3449
04:13:10,300 --> 04:13:12,279
LIAM: Here she comes.

3450
04:13:12,279 --> 04:13:15,708
MARISHA: Yep! I'm going for that motherfucker
right there!

3451
04:13:15,708 --> 04:13:18,721
LIAM: Percy would have shot me out of it. I stay
low.

3452
04:13:18,721 --> 04:13:33,274
MATT: Technically, on that side, there is no water
there. This is all gone. This has all been eaten

3453
04:13:33,274 --> 04:13:36,986
away. You'd have to get up onto the land there.

3454
04:13:36,986 --> 04:13:44,100
MARISHA: Then let me go earth elemental and walk
on over to him.

3455
04:13:44,100 --> 04:13:46,607
MATT: You can move partially.

3456
04:13:46,607 --> 04:13:51,246
MARISHA: There we go.

3457
04:13:51,246 --> 04:13:56,115
MATT: That's as far as you can right there.

3458
04:13:56,115 --> 04:13:58,305
MARISHA: Total? I can't get any further?

3459
04:13:58,305 --> 04:14:01,665
MATT: Nope. With a 30 feet speed for an earth
elemental, right?

3460
04:14:01,665 --> 04:14:02,742
MARISHA: Yes.

3461
04:14:02,742 --> 04:14:03,985
MATT: That's as close as you can get.

3462
04:14:03,985 --> 04:14:06,863
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah.

3463
04:14:06,863 --> 04:14:12,077
MATT: That's your turn? You still have an action.

3464
04:14:12,077 --> 04:14:17,945
MARISHA: There's nothing I can do as an earth
elemental with Feeblemind.

3465
04:14:17,945 --> 04:14:21,647
MATT: You can use your action to dash towards him
if you wanted to.

3466
04:14:21,647 --> 04:14:33,520
MARISHA: Sure. I'll get right up in his face. I
can't grapple him? I can't do anything?

3467
04:14:33,520 --> 04:14:37,330
MATT: The field's up against there, so
technically he had to fly around and land.

3468
04:14:37,330 --> 04:14:39,092
LIAM: Is it just this island left now, Matt?

3469
04:14:39,092 --> 04:14:40,106
MATT: Yep!

3470
04:14:40,106 --> 04:14:42,663
MARISHA: Okay, wait. Is it all the way up into
here?

3471
04:14:42,663 --> 04:14:43,952
MATT: Yeah.

3472
04:14:43,952 --> 04:14:50,965
MARISHA: Sorry. I don't mean to retroact things.
If that's the case, can I do an air elemental and

3473
04:14:50,965 --> 04:14:52,090
fly over?

3474
04:14:52,090 --> 04:14:54,413
MATT: Sure, you can do that.

3475
04:14:54,413 --> 04:14:58,717
TALIESIN: This system's a little confusing.

3476
04:14:58,717 --> 04:15:00,026
MATT: I know, my apologies.

3477
04:15:00,026 --> 04:15:01,597
TALIESIN: You're doing great.

3478
04:15:01,597 --> 04:15:02,949
LIAM: We're vamping.

3479
04:15:02,949 --> 04:15:10,593
MARISHA: In that case, let me do a fire elemental,
if that's okay, and then I'll go 50 feet. I've got

3480
04:15:10,593 --> 04:15:12,658
50 feet of movement and I can move through
one-inch spaces.

3481
04:15:12,658 --> 04:15:19,686
MATT: You can just get up to where he is.

3482
04:15:19,686 --> 04:15:22,999
MARISHA: Can I get in his space and catch him on
fire immediately?

3483
04:15:22,999 --> 04:15:24,803
TALIESIN: He's already on fire still.

3484
04:15:24,803 --> 04:15:26,957
LIAM: It's your third try at a form, dude.

3485
04:15:26,957 --> 04:15:28,402
MARISHA: Are you still on fire?

3486
04:15:28,402 --> 04:15:29,468
MATT: Yeah.

3487
04:15:29,468 --> 04:15:30,538
MARISHA: Should I have rolled again?

3488
04:15:30,538 --> 04:15:31,528
MATT: You should have taken damage last turn.

3489
04:15:31,528 --> 04:15:32,641
LIAM: I'm probably down, then.

3490
04:15:32,641 --> 04:15:33,953
MARISHA: Six points of damage.

3491
04:15:33,953 --> 04:15:35,071
LIAM: I'm unconscious.

3492
04:15:35,071 --> 04:15:36,427
MATT: As you land--

3493
04:15:36,427 --> 04:15:37,977
TALIESIN: You can burn him out.

3494
04:15:37,977 --> 04:15:44,443
MATT: He's smoldering on the ground. You go over
to where Vax is, and he's just burning. His

3495
04:15:44,443 --> 04:15:46,413
unconscious body is burning.

3496
04:15:46,413 --> 04:15:53,262
MARISHA: I go: Hey, Scanlan, I found him! I found
Vax! Scanlan?

3497
04:15:53,262 --> 04:15:57,408
MATT: You look over and see on the field that's
pushing forward, there's a Scanlan corpse being

3498
04:15:57,408 --> 04:16:00,119
rolled as it shoves him closer onto the
battlefield.

3499
04:16:00,119 --> 04:16:01,761
SAM: First! Blood!

3500
04:16:01,761 --> 04:16:07,022
LIAM: Is there water? The water's gone.

3501
04:16:07,022 --> 04:16:11,509
MATT: The water's over here. We'll put you there.

3502
04:16:11,509 --> 04:16:13,096
MARISHA: He's on fire.

3503
04:16:13,096 --> 04:16:15,313
MATT: Percy, your turn.

3504
04:16:15,313 --> 04:16:16,810
MARISHA: I can still attack him.

3505
04:16:16,810 --> 04:16:19,542
MATT: The corpse? Yeah, you can. Go for it.

3506
04:16:19,542 --> 04:16:21,608
LIAM: I thought you used all your shit to get
there.

3507
04:16:21,608 --> 04:16:23,675
MARISHA: No, I just walked there.

3508
04:16:23,675 --> 04:16:25,452
LIAM: Okay, cool.

3509
04:16:25,452 --> 04:16:28,463
SAM: And Grog just suffocated.

3510
04:16:28,463 --> 04:16:33,650
MATT: Nah, he's got constitution for days. He's
got five more minutes on this shit.

3511
04:16:33,650 --> 04:16:40,610
MARISHA: What do I have to roll to hit him, by the
way? He's down and unconscious, so do I have to roll?

3512
04:16:40,610 --> 04:16:42,282
LIAM: It's two death saves per.

3513
04:16:42,282 --> 04:16:44,333
MATT: Melee, you have advantage to attack him.

3514
04:16:44,333 --> 04:16:51,084
LIAM: I'm not going to dodge sleeping.

3515
04:16:51,084 --> 04:16:54,490
TALIESIN: You're literally sitting on him. You're
going to burn him.

3516
04:16:54,490 --> 04:16:57,655
MARISHA: Yeah, both of my attacks hit.

3517
04:16:57,655 --> 04:17:00,321
MATT: His body incinerates.

3518
04:17:00,321 --> 04:17:03,140
MARISHA: I just sit on him, I'm like: Sorry!

3519
04:17:03,140 --> 04:17:05,201
MATT: Yeah, each time.

3520
04:17:05,201 --> 04:17:06,842
SAM: Oh, each time and she hit him twice?

3521
04:17:06,842 --> 04:17:09,761
MATT: Hit him twice. So Vax's body burns away.

3522
04:17:09,761 --> 04:17:13,054
LIAM: I'm two out of three. She's got to hit me
one more time.

3523
04:17:13,054 --> 04:17:15,275
MATT: Oh, that was just the first hit? I thought
you hit him with both.

3524
04:17:15,275 --> 04:17:16,587
MARISHA: I hit him twice.

3525
04:17:16,587 --> 04:17:18,552
LIAM: Oh, so the first one's two. Peace!

3526
04:17:18,552 --> 04:17:20,199
MATT: Both attacks. You're incinerated.

3527
04:17:20,199 --> 04:17:21,796
TALIESIN: I'm a little fucked, but we'll see how
this goes.

3528
04:17:21,796 --> 04:17:23,714
SAM: A little?! You. Can't. Win!

3529
04:17:23,714 --> 04:17:26,634
MARISHA: Sorry, boo.

3530
04:17:26,634 --> 04:17:35,586
TALIESIN: It's okay. Do you have the sensory?
Anytime you turn to rock, you can tell where I am,

3531
04:17:35,586 --> 04:17:41,876
so it doesn't really matter. I'm going to drop
Silence. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast.

3532
04:17:41,876 --> 04:17:43,119
Can I see her?

3533
04:17:43,119 --> 04:17:44,117
MATT: Yeah.

3534
04:17:44,117 --> 04:17:50,791
TALIESIN: I'm casting Hex. I'm taking three shots
from where I'm standing with Animus.

3535
04:17:50,791 --> 04:17:51,898
MATT: Not four?

3536
04:17:51,898 --> 04:18:01,339
TALIESIN: Four, god, I'm just getting used to it.
Four sharpshooter. Number one is 19 to hit.

3537
04:18:01,339 --> 04:18:06,370
MARISHA: Hit. I'm really easy to hit.

3538
04:18:06,370 --> 04:18:17,836
TALIESIN: Oh shit, that's pretty good. That's 27
normal points of damage. Five psychic and five

3539
04:18:17,836 --> 04:18:18,893
necrotic.

3540
04:18:18,893 --> 04:18:20,471
MARISHA: So 37 total?

3541
04:18:20,471 --> 04:18:21,270
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3542
04:18:21,270 --> 04:18:25,161
MARISHA: What's the first one, is it piercing?

3543
04:18:25,161 --> 04:18:26,482
TALIESIN: Piercing.

3544
04:18:26,482 --> 04:18:28,640
MARISHA: Which I take half of because it's not
magical.

3545
04:18:28,640 --> 04:18:31,227
MATT: It is magical because you're shooting with
Animus.

3546
04:18:31,227 --> 04:18:34,144
TALIESIN: Oh, so I don't have to break this up.
This is magical damage.

3547
04:18:34,144 --> 04:18:37,545
MARISHA: So 37 total? Okay.

3548
04:18:37,545 --> 04:18:48,470
TALIESIN: Shot number two. Come on, man, this is
all I need. Fucking fuck fuck. I take two psychic

3549
04:18:48,470 --> 04:18:51,644
damage as it jams. I'm jamming a lot.

3550
04:18:51,644 --> 04:18:53,995
SAM: I'm jamming!

3551
04:18:53,995 --> 04:18:57,449
TALIESIN: Shot number three is Bad News, which is
not magic.

3552
04:18:57,449 --> 04:18:59,205
SAM: We jamming!

3553
04:18:59,205 --> 04:19:07,788
TALIESIN: 25 to hit.

3554
04:19:07,788 --> 04:19:09,327
MATT: That hits.

3555
04:19:09,327 --> 04:19:13,186
TALIESIN: It's not awesome because you take half
damage because it's piercing.

3556
04:19:13,186 --> 04:19:14,294
LIAM: First blood.

3557
04:19:14,294 --> 04:19:19,489
TALIESIN: It's 26 points of piercing damage.

3558
04:19:19,489 --> 04:19:23,203
MATT: Plus d6 necrotic. So 13.

3559
04:19:23,203 --> 04:19:26,461
TALIESIN: Plus one necrotic.

3560
04:19:26,461 --> 04:19:27,931
MATT: 14 points of damage.

3561
04:19:27,931 --> 04:19:38,447
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up the tower. No,
straight up the tower. Spider boots.

3562
04:19:38,447 --> 04:19:43,623
MATT: I know, there's fire there. You get there.

3563
04:19:43,623 --> 04:19:47,750
TALIESIN: I want to get out of the way of the fire
when it finally rolls. Trying to get inside of it.

3564
04:19:47,750 --> 04:19:56,278
SAM: Can you get to the middle and stay there
until the whole island kills her?

3565
04:19:56,278 --> 04:19:58,846
MARISHA: I mean, I can do that too.

3566
04:19:58,846 --> 04:20:08,266
MATT: End of Percy's turn. The field crushes in
even further, which unfortunately does hit you,

3567
04:20:08,266 --> 04:20:11,126
Keyleth. You get pushed in. Make a constitution
saving throw.

3568
04:20:11,126 --> 04:20:18,852
MARISHA: Just a straight con save? Don't fuck me,
Gil. That's good. 20 total.

3569
04:20:18,852 --> 04:20:26,453
MATT: 20, okay. You do succeed. So you take, wow
that's a good roll. Six, six, six, six, five, two,

3570
04:20:26,453 --> 04:20:38,036
four. No, against you. 29 divided, so that's 14
points of force damage. You're now being crushed

3571
04:20:38,036 --> 04:20:41,778
into the rubble and pushed up the top of it.

3572
04:20:41,778 --> 04:20:43,233
MARISHA: Okay.

3573
04:20:43,233 --> 04:20:48,846
SAM: Would you say she's jamming? Into the wall?

3574
04:20:48,846 --> 04:20:50,945
MATT: She's jamming pretty hard into that wall.

3575
04:20:50,945 --> 04:20:53,975
MARISHA: Whose turn is it?

3576
04:20:53,975 --> 04:20:57,705
MATT: That is the field's turn over. It's
Keyleth's turn. You're up.

3577
04:20:57,705 --> 04:21:00,149
MARISHA: So wait, what did the field just do?

3578
04:21:00,149 --> 04:21:02,893
MATT: It's crushing you guys inward.

3579
04:21:02,893 --> 04:21:04,943
MARISHA: Did it do the torch or did the torch
already happen?

3580
04:21:04,943 --> 04:21:10,227
MATT: The torch unfortunately could not because
the territory that it would be on-- I mean, the

3581
04:21:10,227 --> 04:21:15,164
torch goes off, I would say, but you're immune to
fire and Percival's out of the way, and only part

3582
04:21:15,164 --> 04:21:18,126
of it is currently available. It's crushing it
very tight.

3583
04:21:18,126 --> 04:21:21,748
MARISHA: Cool. Cool cool cool.

3584
04:21:21,748 --> 04:21:23,703
TALIESIN: And you took damage from the force
field.

3585
04:21:23,703 --> 04:21:25,529
MATT: So it's your turn, Keyleth.

3586
04:21:25,529 --> 04:21:27,242
MARISHA: I'm going to go earth elemental.

3587
04:21:27,242 --> 04:21:28,663
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

3588
04:21:28,663 --> 04:21:30,215
MATT: Okay.

3589
04:21:30,215 --> 04:21:44,902
MARISHA: Oh yeah! I'm going to jump all over,
Kool-Aid man style, do a big old fatty jump leap.

3590
04:21:44,902 --> 04:21:50,769
Or, if I can get to Percy?

3591
04:21:50,769 --> 04:21:55,000
MATT: You won't get to him with your movement,
unfortunately, because there's a lot of rubble in

3592
04:21:55,000 --> 04:21:56,280
the way.

3593
04:21:56,280 --> 04:21:59,208
MARISHA: Okay. I can't jump over it?

3594
04:21:59,208 --> 04:22:07,259
MATT: You do, but your movement-- You can't jump
more than you can move when you don't have the

3595
04:22:07,259 --> 04:22:08,358
cloak on.

3596
04:22:08,358 --> 04:22:09,854
MARISHA: Am I within ten feet of him?

3597
04:22:09,854 --> 04:22:12,079
MATT: He's about 15 feet from you.

3598
04:22:12,079 --> 04:22:19,150
MARISHA: Fuck! Okay. That's it, then.

3599
04:22:19,150 --> 04:22:21,514
MATT: All right. Percival, you're up.

3600
04:22:21,514 --> 04:22:28,769
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix my gun because
it's the only chance I have. Oh, just barely makes

3601
04:22:28,769 --> 04:22:40,044
it. Yep. And then, since I don't have an attack,
man, there's nothing I can do. I'm going to run on

3602
04:22:40,044 --> 04:22:45,703
the outskirts on the outside of the tower, behind,
and get some cover.

3603
04:22:45,703 --> 04:22:49,210
MATT: Here?

3604
04:22:49,210 --> 04:22:54,990
TALIESIN: Yeah, on the wall. I'm literally on the
wall. It won't crush next round, will it? I mean,

3605
04:22:54,990 --> 04:23:02,964
at current rate, I'm not doing anything dumb? I
mean, I would know, though, if it's been going at--

3606
04:23:02,964 --> 04:23:04,502
MATT: You get the sense that, on this side, it
will, but not on this side--

3607
04:23:04,502 --> 04:23:05,785
TALIESIN: So yeah.

3608
04:23:05,785 --> 04:23:15,393
MATT: End of Percival's turn, it crushes in again.
Now keeping tabs on where it lies. There is the

3609
04:23:15,393 --> 04:23:22,496
edge. There, and then on this side, it's right up
against you, Percival.

3610
04:23:22,496 --> 04:23:24,519
SAM: It's cramming!

3611
04:23:24,519 --> 04:23:30,261
MATT: Keyleth, your turn.

3612
04:23:30,261 --> 04:23:32,040
MARISHA: Can I move five feet to reach him?

3613
04:23:32,040 --> 04:23:36,868
MATT: Yeah. You can get up on top there and bash
downward, essentially.

3614
04:23:36,868 --> 04:23:44,181
SAM: Do it!

3615
04:23:44,181 --> 04:23:48,520
MARISHA: He still has a decent amount of hit
points, though.

3616
04:23:48,520 --> 04:23:51,989
SAM: Yeah, but you can draw <i>first blood</i>.

3617
04:23:51,989 --> 04:24:02,404
MARISHA: This is a force wall. If I throw him into
it, it's going to suck?

3618
04:24:02,404 --> 04:24:06,381
TALIESIN: It's not that bad. I've hit it three
times already.

3619
04:24:06,381 --> 04:24:09,240
MATT: Yeah, him and Grog have been thrown into it
a few times earlier.

3620
04:24:09,240 --> 04:24:10,722
SAM: Crush him!

3621
04:24:10,722 --> 04:24:19,484
MARISHA: Okay, can I grapple him and pummel the
shit out of him?

3622
04:24:19,484 --> 04:24:21,727
MATT: Yeah, if you want to grapple with the first
attack.

3623
04:24:21,727 --> 04:24:23,227
MARISHA: I'm going to grapple with the first
attack.

3624
04:24:23,227 --> 04:24:24,727
MATT: All right, I need you both to make athletics
checks, please.

3625
04:24:24,727 --> 04:24:26,768
SAM: That's you.

3626
04:24:26,768 --> 04:24:27,871
TALIESIN: Yep.

3627
04:24:27,871 --> 04:24:32,290
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil! That's not bad.

3628
04:24:32,290 --> 04:24:33,505
TALIESIN: I'm seven.

3629
04:24:33,505 --> 04:24:34,751
MARISHA: 19.

3630
04:24:34,751 --> 04:24:38,224
MATT: So the first attack, she reaches down and
grabs you. Now, the giant elemental form has

3631
04:24:38,224 --> 04:24:41,719
wrapped its fingers around your shoulders and
torso. You're unable to move from the spot.

3632
04:24:41,719 --> 04:24:46,155
MARISHA: Do one more attack on him. Do I get
advantage on the grappling?

3633
04:24:46,155 --> 04:24:50,871
MATT: Your movement is zero. Hm? Your next attack,
you attack him. You don't get advantage.

3634
04:24:50,871 --> 04:25:01,154
MARISHA: I just attack him? Not good. Sorry, 12.

3635
04:25:01,154 --> 04:25:02,401
TALIESIN: That won't hit me.

3636
04:25:02,401 --> 04:25:04,988
MATT: Nope, so you're held there in space.
Percival.

3637
04:25:04,988 --> 04:25:09,157
TALIESIN: Thunderwave, 5th-level.

3638
04:25:09,157 --> 04:25:11,847
SAM: You can do 5th-level spells?

3639
04:25:11,847 --> 04:25:13,053
TALIESIN: Yep.

3640
04:25:13,053 --> 04:25:14,687
SAM: Damn!

3641
04:25:14,687 --> 04:25:16,861
MATT: Thunderwave from which one?

3642
04:25:16,861 --> 04:25:20,296
TALIESIN: From my Stone King Cincture.

3643
04:25:20,296 --> 04:25:23,820
MATT: That's true. All righty. So go ahead and
make, what's the saving throw on that?

3644
04:25:23,820 --> 04:25:25,917
TALIESIN: DC 16.

3645
04:25:25,917 --> 04:25:29,536
MATT: DC 16 constitution. Go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw, Keyleth.

3646
04:25:29,536 --> 04:25:36,466
MARISHA: Saved with a natural 18.

3647
04:25:36,466 --> 04:25:40,396
SAM: It's 6d8 halved thunder damage.

3648
04:25:40,396 --> 04:25:42,499
MATT: And she gets pushed, or does she not get
pushed?

3649
04:25:42,499 --> 04:25:43,957
SAM: No. Because she saved, she doesn't get
pushed.

3650
04:25:43,957 --> 04:25:45,404
MATT: Okay, so still grappled.

3651
04:25:45,404 --> 04:26:02,491
TALIESIN: 6d8? All right. Halved. (counting) 29
halved.

3652
04:26:02,491 --> 04:26:06,056
MATT: Right, so 14. End of your turn, Percival?

3653
04:26:06,056 --> 04:26:12,828
TALIESIN: That counts as a whole attack, doesn't
it? Then I'm going to run-- I can't. She's got me.

3654
04:26:12,828 --> 04:26:14,990
I can't even attempt to break free.

3655
04:26:14,990 --> 04:26:20,054
MATT: Actually, you could have, but you spent it to
cast Thunderwave. It would've if she had failed

3656
04:26:20,054 --> 04:26:21,361
the save.

3657
04:26:21,361 --> 04:26:24,795
TALIESIN: I don't get to add a d6 to that of hex
damage, do I?

3658
04:26:24,795 --> 04:26:26,407
MATT: Technically you do, yeah.

3659
04:26:26,407 --> 04:26:29,414
TALIESIN: Hey, six points of necrotic.

3660
04:26:29,414 --> 04:26:34,424
LIAM: Oh no, she's down to 106.

3661
04:26:34,424 --> 04:26:36,371
SAM: Until the next turn.

3662
04:26:36,371 --> 04:26:37,683
TALIESIN: I'm still higher.

3663
04:26:37,683 --> 04:26:39,055
MARISHA: You are still higher.

3664
04:26:39,055 --> 04:26:43,379
TALIESIN: Actually, no, I'm not. Never mind. I'm
at 107. So yeah! One point higher.

3665
04:26:43,379 --> 04:26:52,765
MATT: Percival, top of your turn. This side stops
closing in. This side does. Percy, you are now

3666
04:26:52,765 --> 04:27:01,296
being smashed between the wall of the tower and
the field as she's holding you in space. I need

3667
04:27:01,296 --> 04:27:05,339
you both to make constitution saving throws as
you're having to hold him there to keep him in

3668
04:27:05,339 --> 04:27:10,223
space. But you have advantage because you're
pulling away, I'll say.

3669
04:27:10,223 --> 04:27:16,385
TALIESIN: Yeah, 18. So it's 26.

3670
04:27:16,385 --> 04:27:17,979
MARISHA: 17.

3671
04:27:17,979 --> 04:27:25,101
MATT: All right, So you fail. You do get pushed
back 15 feet and you take, oh man. All right.

3672
04:27:25,101 --> 04:27:26,365
That's a good roll.

3673
04:27:26,365 --> 04:27:29,145
TALIESIN: Technically, since I'm grappled, do I go
with her?

3674
04:27:29,145 --> 04:27:36,665
MATT: No, because it breaks the grapple because it
pushes you back. So that's 30 points of force

3675
04:27:36,665 --> 04:27:43,541
damage to you, Keyleth. 15 to you. However, you
are currently restrained as you are being held

3676
04:27:43,541 --> 04:27:49,830
against the wall and the force field. You're
pushed back.

3677
04:27:49,830 --> 04:27:52,246
MARISHA: Oh, and he's stuck?

3678
04:27:52,246 --> 04:27:58,047
MATT: He's being sandwiched between the stone wall
and the force field, like (crackling). We're

3679
04:27:58,047 --> 04:28:03,680
talking like Tetsuo-crush. All right.

3680
04:28:03,680 --> 04:28:05,432
TALIESIN: It's my turn now, right? Or no?

3681
04:28:05,432 --> 04:28:06,872
MATT: No, now it's Keyleth's turn.

3682
04:28:06,872 --> 04:28:11,869
SAM: And that's when the Irresistible Dance kicks
in. Delayed response.

3683
04:28:11,869 --> 04:28:23,967
MARISHA: Can I take and through this wall, push it
and start crushing Percy? Two slam attacks with

3684
04:28:23,967 --> 04:28:25,691
the wall, crush crush?

3685
04:28:25,691 --> 04:28:27,931
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm into that.

3686
04:28:27,931 --> 04:28:32,158
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make an attack.

3687
04:28:32,158 --> 04:28:35,734
MARISHA: Against the wall or against Percy?

3688
04:28:35,734 --> 04:28:36,919
MATT: Against the wall.

3689
04:28:36,919 --> 04:28:41,796
MARISHA: First one is a 20 total. No, 21 total.
The second one is a 19 total.

3690
04:28:41,796 --> 04:28:50,243
MATT: Okay. I won't have you roll damage because
it's siege, but what you do is each one of these

3691
04:28:50,243 --> 04:28:55,116
shoves forces him into the wall. So I need you to
make two constitution saving throws.

3692
04:28:55,116 --> 04:29:04,312
TALIESIN: Two constitution saving throws. Here we
go. That's a 19 and a 21.

3693
04:29:04,312 --> 04:29:17,240
MATT: Both succeed. So that's 27 points of force
damage, reduced to 13.

3694
04:29:17,240 --> 04:29:19,990
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's 92 minus 13.

3695
04:29:19,990 --> 04:29:27,685
MATT: That's a shitty roll. Ten points of force
damage, reduced to five.

3696
04:29:27,685 --> 04:29:29,199
TALIESIN: 74.

3697
04:29:29,199 --> 04:29:32,186
MARISHA: Does he take any from being sandwiched?

3698
04:29:32,186 --> 04:29:34,314
MATT: I mean, he's taking the damage because he's
being sandwiched.

3699
04:29:34,314 --> 04:29:37,846
MARISHA: Okay. Can I use my bonus action to go
earth elemental again?

3700
04:29:37,846 --> 04:29:40,171
MATT: You have to change to a different form.

3701
04:29:40,171 --> 04:29:44,507
MARISHA: Then I will stay.

3702
04:29:44,507 --> 04:29:46,559
MATT: Okay. Percival, your turn.

3703
04:29:46,559 --> 04:29:48,591
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and squeeze around out
of this.

3704
04:29:48,591 --> 04:29:51,445
MATT: Top of your turn, make a constitution saving
throw.

3705
04:29:51,445 --> 04:30:01,005
TALIESIN: Oh, fine. Natural 20. I really would've
liked that on a shot, but that's okay. It would

3706
04:30:01,005 --> 04:30:02,648
have made life way easier.

3707
04:30:02,648 --> 04:30:11,006
MATT: That is 19 points of force damage, reduced
to nine. Right, so you're trying to escape from

3708
04:30:11,006 --> 04:30:18,931
the restraint? All right, make an athletics check.
Athletics or acrobatics, I believe. Let me double

3709
04:30:18,931 --> 04:30:20,506
check real fast.

3710
04:30:20,506 --> 04:30:23,754
TALIESIN: If I can just use my boots to squeeze
off the side--

3711
04:30:23,754 --> 04:30:29,215
MATT: Well no, it's not breaking from a grapple
necessarily. It's from being pinned. This isn't

3712
04:30:29,215 --> 04:30:33,591
weaseling out of it. This is pure force, so this
would be athletics.

3713
04:30:33,591 --> 04:30:35,378
TALIESIN: I can't try and sneak through the
window?

3714
04:30:35,378 --> 04:30:42,085
MATT: No, the window, it's a slit. It's like that
wide and your back is pressed against it.

3715
04:30:42,085 --> 04:30:50,154
TALIESIN: This is not how I wanted to go out.
Athletics, then? Oh boy. Nope.

3716
04:30:50,154 --> 04:30:52,324
MATT: All right, so you're still restrained.

3717
04:30:52,324 --> 04:30:55,357
TALIESIN: I can't see her at all, can I?

3718
04:30:55,357 --> 04:30:59,439
MATT: Currently, no. She's behind the wall,
pushing you into it.

3719
04:30:59,439 --> 04:31:09,070
TALIESIN: Yep. Huh. Hmm. Yeah, no, I got nothing.

3720
04:31:09,070 --> 04:31:13,241
MATT: All right. At the end of that, the field
pushes in once more.

3721
04:31:13,241 --> 04:31:16,204
TALIESIN: Breaks the wall, probably.

3722
04:31:16,204 --> 04:31:20,293
MATT: Well no, it's pushing against that. It's not
pushing further, sorry, because they're both

3723
04:31:20,293 --> 04:31:24,857
stopped. They're now holding that space. So you
don't take damage again. It doesn't force you. But

3724
04:31:24,857 --> 04:31:27,171
you're still pinned. Keyleth, your turn.

3725
04:31:27,171 --> 04:31:34,846
MARISHA: What is best right now?

3726
04:31:34,846 --> 04:31:41,061
TALIESIN: I want to have a moment.

3727
04:31:41,061 --> 04:31:43,157
MATT: What is best in life?

3728
04:31:43,157 --> 04:31:52,357
MARISHA: Yeah, can I do two slam attacks on him
again? Bam, bam, multi-attack?

3729
04:31:52,357 --> 04:31:56,862
MATT: Pushing him into the wall again? Okay.

3730
04:31:56,862 --> 04:32:02,966
MARISHA: Not good. Same thing for that first one.
Twelve. Oh wait, it's hitting the wall, though?

3731
04:32:02,966 --> 04:32:12,095
MATT: You're essentially just pushing against the
wall. It'll shove, yeah. It's essentially a ten or

3732
04:32:12,095 --> 04:32:13,343
lower.

3733
04:32:13,343 --> 04:32:19,494
MARISHA: Okay, so 15 damage for that first one.

3734
04:32:19,494 --> 04:32:23,988
MATT: No damage on this. You're just pushing the
wall, so the force against him. So make a

3735
04:32:23,988 --> 04:32:25,764
constitution saving throw, Percival.

3736
04:32:25,764 --> 04:32:26,870
TALIESIN: I make one or two?

3737
04:32:26,870 --> 04:32:28,204
MATT: We'll find out. Roll a second attack.

3738
04:32:28,204 --> 04:32:30,921
MARISHA: Natural 19.

3739
04:32:30,921 --> 04:32:36,476
TALIESIN: It's the one thing I'm good at. Oh, not
this time. Ten and 12.

3740
04:32:36,476 --> 04:32:41,612
MATT: Ten and 12. All right. You take, first, 24
points of force damage.

3741
04:32:41,612 --> 04:32:43,196
TALIESIN: 24.

3742
04:32:43,196 --> 04:32:52,228
MATT: 24 points of force damage. Keyleth, I need
you to make a strength check, please. Or a

3743
04:32:52,228 --> 04:32:53,647
strength saving throw.

3744
04:32:53,647 --> 04:32:55,075
MARISHA: Strength saving throw?

3745
04:32:55,075 --> 04:32:56,340
MATT: Correct.

3746
04:32:56,340 --> 04:33:02,941
MARISHA: Natural 17, so 23.

3747
04:33:02,941 --> 04:33:07,777
MATT: So as it pushes back, you manage to keep it
back and then shove him back into it. And then, oh

3748
04:33:07,777 --> 04:33:19,076
my god. That is 25 points of force damage to you,
Percival. And Keyleth, make another strength

3749
04:33:19,076 --> 04:33:23,386
saving throw as the section of wall that you've
pushed in, that's loose and you're shoving him

3750
04:33:23,386 --> 04:33:25,060
with, is being shoved backward.

3751
04:33:25,060 --> 04:33:26,176
MARISHA: Natural 19.

3752
04:33:26,176 --> 04:33:29,372
MATT: You've managed to hold it in place. Still
restrained, you're slowly sandwiching him. Making

3753
04:33:29,372 --> 04:33:33,338
a Percival sandwich. Percy, your turn.

3754
04:33:33,338 --> 04:33:41,029
TALIESIN: Hail Mary. Trying to squeeze out of
this. Nope. That's eight.

3755
04:33:41,029 --> 04:33:45,414
SAM: The ghost of Scanlan floats in front of you.

3756
04:33:45,414 --> 04:33:47,836
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw.

3757
04:33:47,836 --> 04:33:52,670
MARISHA and LIAM: (chanting) First blood! First
blood!

3758
04:33:52,670 --> 04:33:56,176
TALIESIN: I can't count, guys! 25.

3759
04:33:56,176 --> 04:34:02,349
MATT: 25, okay. So you take 13 points of force
damage. Keyleth, your turn.

3760
04:34:02,349 --> 04:34:13,415
MARISHA: Keyleth, my turn? Argh! Squishy squishy!
Squishy Percy! Ooh, no, ten total.

3761
04:34:13,415 --> 04:34:15,725
MATT: Ten total? Just barely.

3762
04:34:15,725 --> 04:34:20,703
MARISHA: And second one, 12 total. Those were bad
rolls.

3763
04:34:20,703 --> 04:34:22,636
MATT: Roll two constitution saving throws,
Percival.

3764
04:34:22,636 --> 04:34:28,606
TALIESIN: This might be the end. I'm at nothing.
18 and 11.

3765
04:34:28,606 --> 04:34:31,325
MATT: First one succeeds. You take 11 points of
force damage.

3766
04:34:31,325 --> 04:34:32,678
TALIESIN: I'm out.

3767
04:34:32,678 --> 04:34:40,910
MATT: Second push, you feel Percival begin to pop
and squish against the outer field. And for the

3768
04:34:40,910 --> 04:34:49,258
purposes of this, one more round of shoving and,
with a (squish), Percival-jelly begins to ooze out

3769
04:34:49,258 --> 04:34:51,592
from behind the wall in which you shove him
against the force.

3770
04:34:51,592 --> 04:34:53,422
TALIESIN: You hear everything I own crack.

3771
04:34:53,422 --> 04:34:57,037
MATT: While you were technically healing 20 points
every round underneath the green beam--

3772
04:34:57,037 --> 04:35:01,351
MARISHA: Oh shit. Wow, yeah.

3773
04:35:01,351 --> 04:35:10,185
MATT: The field dissipates. The rubble begins to
separate and float in space. The ruined corpses of

3774
04:35:10,185 --> 04:35:18,233
all your allies then float aloft around you and
are slowly re-stitched back to life. Grog appears,

3775
04:35:18,233 --> 04:35:24,686
pulled back from the water dimension, from the
depths of the drowning. And you see the bearded

3776
04:35:24,686 --> 04:35:29,803
patron descend from above. As he pats you on the
head and goes--

3777
04:35:29,803 --> 04:35:32,497
MARISHA: I was never religious in-game, but now I
am!

3778
04:35:32,497 --> 04:35:35,472
MATT: "Good job!"

3779
04:35:35,472 --> 04:35:40,216
(laughter)

3780
04:35:40,216 --> 04:35:42,654
MATT: And with that--

3781
04:35:42,654 --> 04:35:45,606
(yelling)

3782
04:35:45,606 --> 04:35:46,998
LIAM: All hail the queen!

3783
04:35:46,998 --> 04:35:53,012
TALIESIN: Without a spell to her name.

3784
04:35:53,012 --> 04:35:55,992
MATT: Level 20 druids, man.

3785
04:35:55,992 --> 04:35:58,426
SAM: In 30 days, she'll know what happened.

3786
04:35:58,426 --> 04:35:59,484
MATT: Yep.

3787
04:35:59,484 --> 04:36:03,064
MARISHA: Yeah, in 20 days I'll be like, what?

3788
04:36:03,064 --> 04:36:05,927
TALIESIN: I had the weirdest dream a month ago!

3789
04:36:05,927 --> 04:36:11,011
MARISHA: I dreamt I killed you, and you, and you.

3790
04:36:11,011 --> 04:36:14,994
MATT: It's funny, I was like, okay, once they
start getting into the high-level spells this is

3791
04:36:14,994 --> 04:36:23,141
really going to turn-- And then Feeblemind. All
right, this is going to be a drag-out brawl to the

3792
04:36:23,141 --> 04:36:24,420
very end.

3793
04:36:24,420 --> 04:36:27,344
TALIESIN: I was really hoping I could burn some
grit back and then do a whole bunch of damage all

3794
04:36:27,344 --> 04:36:28,670
at once.

3795
04:36:28,670 --> 04:36:32,632
MARISHA: But man, you dodged my Feeblemind. That
was hot. That was amazing.

3796
04:36:32,632 --> 04:36:35,499
LIAM: I did what I came here to do.

3797
04:36:35,499 --> 04:36:44,300
TRAVIS: Yeah, I went to the Water Plane with a few
hundred HP left. I was super healthy in the

3798
04:36:44,300 --> 04:36:45,546
