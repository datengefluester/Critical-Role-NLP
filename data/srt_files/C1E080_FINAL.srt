I hope you enjoyed your--

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,630
Last we left off
was a little crazy,

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,570
but before we get
to that circumstance,

let's go ahead and start
with our announcements.

12

Yay!

First and foremost, our
first episode of the year

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,180
is sponsored by us
happy to be back.

00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,210
We have no
sponsor tonight.

17

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,780
MARISHA: Happiness!

19

MATT: So sponsored instead
by viewers like you.

20
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,060
So...

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,720
Thank you.

22
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,120
But, yeah, so other
announcements we have.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,540
Me and Marisha will be running
from this episode tonight

24
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,720
to pack and leave at a super
early, pre-dawn flight.

25
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,570
Pretty much, or at
dawn flight, to MAGFest.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,750
We'll be there getting
in later tomorrow,

27
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,330
and be there this weekend.

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,450
So, those of you who are going
to MAGFest, we'll see you there.

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,239
We have--

30
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,420
LAURA: Is that what it is,
just a lot of magazines?

31
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,660
MATT: Just a lot of magazines.

32
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,780
-TALIESIN: People, US Weekly.
-MARISHA: Oprah.

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,390
MATT: We pretty much got
in there only because

34
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,000
of the article
in Game Informer.

35
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,600
That's the only
reason we were invited.

36
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,330
No, MAGFest is great.

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,240
We have a Critical Role
panel tomorrow evening

38
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,390
that me and Marisha
will be doing,

39
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,840
and other fun stuff
Saturday and Sunday.

40
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,150
So, look for us
in the schedule

41
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,150

to seeing you guys

43
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,390
Travis, you wanted to
mention something real quick?

44
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,330
TRAVIS: Yes! I wanted to
give a quick shout out

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,240
to Kathy Creshe, Creshaw,

46
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,300
I don't know
how to say it.

47
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,810
TALIESIN: That was a good shout out.

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
TRAVIS: From Pennsylvania.

49
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,720
SAM: Big fan of the show?

50
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,150
TRAVIS: We love you,
from us, to you.

51
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,480
-LAURA: We read your email.
-TRAVIS: It was wonderful.

52
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,060
TRAVIS: Sam!

53
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,630
SAM: Uh, yeah, tonight's sponsor
is Critical Role, as you said,

54
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,810
we have lots of stuff.

55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,690
Lots of merchandise
available in the store.

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,300
The logo shirt, mugs,
patches, nail wraps,

57
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,810
hats, key chains, and
necklaces are available

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,600
and if you didn't see it
over the Christmas break,

59
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,540
we have the
Gilmore shirts and the

60
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,090
"How do you want
to do this?" shirts

61
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,630
and you guys know this,

62
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,690
we have a big Spanish
speaking fan base,

63
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,330
and I wanted to
give them some love,

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,360
so I thought I'd do our
ad tonight in Spanish.

65
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,660
Two notes, two notes,
I don't speak Spanish,

66
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,840
and second note
is my neighbor's son

67
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,000
translated this for me.

68
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,840
So, he's in Spanish Two.

69
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,030
Should be pretty basic.

70
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,420
TRAVIS: Not, "He's Spanish too."

71
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,030
SAM: No, he's-- he's a
sophomore in high school.

72
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Hola, me llamo Sam Riegel.

73
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,220
Aquí está mi perro. Se llama Travis Willingham.

74
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,090
Una broma. ¿Te gustan las camisas t-shirt?

75
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,740
Espero que sí porque tenemos dos camisas
t-shirt para vender en nuestra tienda.

76
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,000
Una es color morado.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,750
Es para Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

78
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,090
(laughter)

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,210
La otra no es morado, es gris.

80
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,120
Tiene el slogan de Matthew Mercer,
which is...

81
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,870
¿Como quieres hacer esto?

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,780
(laughter)

83
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,300
No cuestan muchos pesos.

84
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,480
Tu vas a ir internet y comprar ahora.

85
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,150
¡Gracias por favor!

86
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,450

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,420
-TRAVIS: Muy bien!
-MARISHA: Yay for Spanish Two!

88
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,150
TALIESIN: High school Spanish is
the official language

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,030
of Los Angeles, well done.

90
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,630
TRAVIS: A future translator
will then, like, show up?

91
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,660
-SAM: I don't know.
-TALIESIN: It'll be insulted.

92
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,030
Actually, yeah, it'll
actually Google translate

93
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,240
and will be like,
I refuse to even touch this.

94
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,390
SAM: It's for our
Spanish language viewers.

95
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,510
-There are many.
-TRAVIS: That was great.

96
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,690
MATT: This is true.
Thank you so much.

97
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,720
Anyone else?

98
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,510
Oh, I want to announce
real fast too.

99
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,180
We received quite a
bit of Critmas gifts

100
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,180
after we had filmed the
Critmas episode last month.

101
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,420
So, as we're slowly retrieving
them from the mailbox,

102
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,780
me, Marisha,
Taliesin, and possibly

103
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,570
anybody that's available
at the time, Liam,

104
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,120
Laura will be
doing a Periscope opening

105
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,270
of the rest of those gifts

106
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,720
in the next couple
of weeks or so.

107
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,240
Be announcing it
ahead of time,

108
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,210
so pay attention to
that, but it is coming.

109
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
So, don't worry.

110
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,840
We'll be getting
to your presents

111
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,510
and thanking you for all your
awesome unnecessary generosity.

112
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,420
You're so wonderful

113
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,480
and we'll let you
know once it's happening.

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,060
So, getting us up to speed
with the current circumstance

129
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,060
that we left off at
the end of last episode.

130
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,870
Vox Machina,
the main adventurers,

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,270
spending the better
part of this past year

132
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,120
under the shadow of
the Chroma Conclave,

133
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,660
a group of ancient
chromatic dragons

134
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,720
that have
banded together,

135
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,840
seemingly under the banner
of Thordak, The Cinder King,

136
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,720
a great red dragon
that had been sealed

137
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,570
in the fire elemental plane
for a number of years.

138
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,840
Newly released and
carrying with him

139
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,090
what was called
a soul anchor.

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,780
A magical artifact made from
the heart of a fire primordial

141
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,150
that had begun to
cause him to mutate

142
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,420
and swell and become something
beyond what he was.

143
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,180
Also driving him
apparently insane.

144
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,840
As he dominated the
countryside of Tal'Dorei,

145
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,210
along with the
rest of the Conclave,

146
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,690
you gather artifacts
of great power

147
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,120
called the Vestiges
of Divergence

148
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,330
under the guidance
of two sphinx allies.

149
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,630
You travel between
various planes

150
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,090
and gathering
these artifacts

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,600
gathered allies and prepared for
this climactic confrontation

152
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,600
in your home city of Emon,

153
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,510
now partially brought
to ruin and flame.

154
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,090
You assembled an army.

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,300
You snuck beneath the city.

156
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,450
You arrived within the center
of the Cloudtop district

157
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,750
nearly under the nose of
Thordak's defending hordes,

158
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,210
and through a climactic
seeming sacrifice

159
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,510
by your friends
Kashaw and Zahra,

160
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,660
were allowed to pass
directly into the Cloudtop

161
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,750
heading off Thordak
before he could emerge

162
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,780
from his subterranean lair

163
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,360
and lay waste to the armies

164
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,060
as they pushed inward
towards his lair.

165
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,180
♪

166
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,210
TRAVIS: When you say it like that.

167
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,810
MATT: There you all did battle

168
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,360
with the great colossal
Thordak, The Cinder King.

169
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,090
A well prepared
fight rolled out

170
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,480
and while there
was much danger,

171
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,720
you all persevered and managed
to, using the vestiges,

172
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,300
destroy the soul anchor

173
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,240
once it was revealed within the
body of the great red dragon.

174
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,750
His form rescinding
and withering back

175
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,480
to its regular,
seemingly withering size.

176
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,660
You-- it attempted to
flee back into its lair,

177
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,360
but the rather rapid and
temporarily winged rogue,

178
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,720
Vax'ildan gave chase and

179
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,840
dealt a finishing blow
to the great red beast

180
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,450
midway through its cavern
towards its lair.

181
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,419
There you were joined
briefly by your sister

182
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,270
and an ally you had made through
this circumstance, Raishan,

183
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,390
one green dragon.

184
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,660
The member of the Conclave
that seemingly had made

185
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,660
a tenuous alliance with you

186
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,450
as her goal also was
to destroy Thordak.

187
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,420
Aiding you in the battle,
Raishan followed suit

188
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,600
and upon the corpse of
Thordak laying cut, bleeding

189
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,780
and dead in the
center of this cavern,

190
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,270
she wished to take her end
of the deal you had made.

191
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,420
To be left alone with
the corpse for a moment

192
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,180
to acquire some
secret knowledge

193
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,000
that apparently she was seeking
from the dead dragon.

194
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,450
Upon releasing the
energy from the scroll

195
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,720
which she had utilized
the incantation from,

196
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,600
you decided that vengeance
being your oath as a paladin

197
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,270
and the history that
you have with Keyleth

198
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,180
and Keyleth's people
that died under the guise

199
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,120
of Raishan's initial
plotting with Thordak

200
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,390
to not let this creature
stand and attacked it.

201
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,480
Both you and your sister, just
as Keyleth began to arrive.

202
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,090
The rest of the party
slowly staggering behind.

203
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,060
Raishan sneered and went
further back into the cavern.

204
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,780
You all gave chase into this
dark, volcanic tunnel system

205
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,450
which then opened up into
a large, red flaming cavern

206
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,000
filled with
lava pools and rivers,

207
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,720
and apparently a
handful of red eggs,

208
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,570
it looked like scattered
throughout this room.

209
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,870
Thick dark red
crimson scales

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,420
with crystalline formations
pouring out of the sides.

211
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,120
Very similar to Thordak's
primordial dragon form.

212
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:22,000
Upon finding not Raishan,
but just this empty space,

213
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,390
you looked up
to see a series

214
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,540
of arcane
summoned meteors

215
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,210
suddenly given form,

216
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,570
rocketing from the
ceiling of the cavern

217
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,330
and slamming into the floor

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
dealing some of you
a pretty dangerous blow

219
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,210
and sending you scattering
across the floor a bit.

220
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,210
Vex being thrown
across the way.

221
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,840
You all managed to survive as
at the end of the last battle,

222
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,330
I'd forgotten that
you had made your save

223
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,660
and you actually, your
bludgeon damage was halved,

224
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,210
so Vex is conscious,
though still hurting.

225
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,150
-SAM: ♪ Whoo ♪
-LIAM: ♪ Whoo ♪♪

226
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,660
MATT: As the dust settles

227
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,180
and you all take stock of
what had just transpired,

228
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,780
you see the snout of
the green dragon pull up

229
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,600
into what appears
to be a series

230
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,780
of dark volcanic
exhaust tunnels

231
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,060
that seem to be like
a hive network of--

232
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,210
of honeycomb type tunnels

233
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,330
that just spiral off
all through the ceiling,

234
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,000
and that's where we left off
in the last sequence here.

235
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,810
SAM: Geez, Louise.

236
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,000
MATT: Which, previously, behind
if I'm--if I'm correct,

237
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,060
and I believe I am, and
if not, internet, it's fine,

238
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,630
we'll--we'll do
the narrative.

239
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,750
We have the three
of you in the room.

240
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,300
We have Percy, Scanlan,
Pike and Gilmore

241
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,480
rushing up behind
as fast as they can.

242
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,540
Grog and Kima
had stayed behind

243
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,450
to finish up one of
the more recent battles

244
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,720
and Jarret is
just not going in.

245
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,030
He is not in a
place to follow suit.

246
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,690
"You got this, you got this.

247
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,510
Do not worry, it's okay."

248
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,150
LIAM: Before we ran into
the bigger chamber,

249
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,810
Gilmore and Jarret had caught up
with us if I remember correctly.

250
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,810
MATT: No, they did not.

251
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,510
LAURA: Oh, they hadn't
gotten to us.

252
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,810
LIAM: I remember
that they did.

253
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,060
MATT: No, they would have gotten
into the chamber with you.

254
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,810
Only the three of you
made it into the chamber.

255
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,150
LIAM: That's what I mean.

256
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,300
MATT: They got into the tunnel,

257
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,480
but they hadn't
got up to your guys.

258
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,810
The speed in which
you guys all got there

259
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,480
was basically just Raishan
and the three of you,

260
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,870
then the
attack happened.

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,060
Raishan rushed in,
you rush after her.

262
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,420
Everyone else has kinda
been left in the dust.

263
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,840
They're not too
far behind you,

264
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,750
but things be as they may.

265
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,510
We begin tonight's episode

266
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,780
at this next
round of combat.

267
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,180
Continuing
where we last did.

268
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,000
LAURA: Oh, God, oh God!

269
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,420
-MARISHA: Jesus Christ.
-TRAVIS: Oh God, oh God, oh God.

270
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,390
-MATT: So--
-SAM: Why from there?

271
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,180
You're fine.

272
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,660
-TALIESIN: No, stop, don't.
-MARISHA: Yeah, police.

273
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,360
MATT: So, at the top of
this combat round,

274
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,300
technically, Percy, you
have the initiative on this.

275
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,150
You are continuing to push
through this-- this hallway.

276
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,270
You haven't quite even,
at a double dash,

277
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,000
you can hear explosions
in the distance

278
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,030
and then you guys watch as
suddenly smoke, silt and ash

279
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,780
come flying through
the tunnel from within

280
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,630
immediately followed by the
sound of these large, heavy,

281
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,690
banging explosions.

282
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,360
Some sort of heavy impact,

283
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,420
a series of impacts seem to have
detonated deep within the tunnel

284
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,840
and immediately set everyone
in the vicinity on edge

285
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,720
knowing that something
is still transpiring

286
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,090
in a very dangerous way
deeper within this tunnel.

287
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,120
TALIESIN: I am throwing on my mask and
I am running into the room.

288
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,630
I'm actually gonna
be spider crawling.

289
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,390
I'm gonna be on the-- on
the walls so that I'm-- yeah.

290
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,210
I don't want to be in the line
of anything that happens.

291
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,300
MARISHA: That's awesome.

292
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,870
LIAM: Spider Percy's
my favorite Percy.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,120
MATT: It's just the feet, Percy.

294
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,750
MARISHA: ♪ Spider Percy,
Spider Percy ♪♪

295
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,270
MATT: You can if you want,
if you really want to.

296
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,480
SAM: He's like
walking like this?

297
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,480
-MATT: Yeah.
-TALIESIN:Running.

298
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,480
SAM: Cool!

299
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,570
TALIESIN: This ain't Dr. Strange,
this is--

300
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,270
LIAM: He's doing this and
nothing's happening.

301
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,120
TALIESIN: Out of fluid, you know.

302
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,570
LIAM: If anyone can make it,
it's you.

303
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,870
TALIESIN: I know, I got to make-- I got
to make Spider-- Spider Percy.

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,420
MATT: So, anyway,
that ends your turn.

305
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,840
You--you run past
on the side of the wall,

306
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,510
as the ash begins to settle
around you as you run past,

307
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,210
kind of preparing your weapons
for a coming confrontation,

308
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
you glance out to your right

309
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,420
and see there the smoldering
wreckage of red scales

310
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:22,330
and dragon blood that was once
Thordak, the cinder king.

311
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,030
You see that and
down it's about--

312
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,450
You keep running.

313
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,840
You can see a gentle glimmer in
the distance of a battlefield,

314
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,090
but you're not
quite there yet.

315
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,300
TALIESIN: Okay.

316
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,540
MATT: Okay, the top
of the round.

317
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,840
The three of you finding
yourselves in this circumstance.

318
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,390
We go to the lair actions.

319
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,540
So, these lair actions are--

320
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,060
LAURA: Oh God.

321
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,690
MATT: Of Thordak's lair, as this
is not Raishan's lair,

322
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,120
but even though
Thordak is dead,

323
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,270
the lair itself
has its own natural,

324
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,060
naturally
occurring dangers.

325
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,270
-TRAVIS: Damn it!
-MATT: So.

326
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
SAM: What?

327
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,270
That don't make
no sense, man.

328
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Thordak's dead.

329
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,810
His lair dies with him.

330
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,330
MATT: Over time!

331
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
Maybe, you don't know.

332
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,810
TRAVIS: His home security
system still pays for it.

333
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,270
-LAURA: Yeah.
-MATT: Exactly, yeah.

334
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,660
It's-- it's on a recurring
subscription plan.

335
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,780
So, there will be--

336
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,330
TALIESIN: How do I pee?

337
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,570
MATT: The lava that you had
just landed across.

338
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,750
So, Vex'ahlia, as you are
knocked from the explosions

339
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,390
of the meteors from
landing on your back,

340
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,030
and just barely getting
back up to your feet,

341
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,090
your vision comes back as
you see the stream of lava

342
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,870
that's just
barely pouring past.

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,090
Very slowly begins to...

344
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,330
LAURA: I back up, I back up.

345
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,330
MATT: As it opens and sprays
here at 20 foot radius.

346
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
LAURA: I climb back up
and I bump an egg.

347
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,090
MATT: I'm going to bring
out my templates.

348
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,240
TALIESIN: No.

349
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,000
LAURA: This is gonna
kill me, isn't it?

350
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,180
MATT: This will explode
and all three of you--

351
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,090
I need you all three to make
dexterity saving throws.

352
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
-MARISHA: Oh, boy.
-TALIESIN: Yay.

353
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,690
MARISHA: This is great.

354
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,510
LAURA: Cool.

355
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,270
This is-- is this--

356
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,780
TALIESIN: First roll of 2017.

357
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,300
-LAURA: Oh, wait, I'm hasted.
-MARISHA: Twenty total.

358
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,360
-SAM: Twenty total's good.
-MARISHA: Yeah!

359
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,330
-LAURA: Seven.
-LIAM: Twenty-seven.

360
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,600
MATT: Okay, that's fine.

361
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,150
So, as it is a hotter, more
dangerous vicinity here,

362
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,450
the damage is higher, but you
all managed to make your saves,

363
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,600
so you're only
taking half damage

364
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,630
as you all avoid from
the spray of magma

365
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,120
that just bursts out and
splashes in your area.

366
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,270
LIAM: Evasion keeps me
at zero, yeah?

367
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,270
MATT: Yes, because you have
your rogue evasionness,

368
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,150
and it's
three ones, alright.

369
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,660
-LAURA: Yay.
-TALIESIN: Yay.

370
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,570
MATT: So, that'll be 18 points of
fire damage reduced to nine.

371
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,570
(indistinguishable dialogue)

372
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,480
MARISHA: I mean, I'm not, you know.

373
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,570
-LAURA: Still terrified.
-MARISHA: Taking it for granted.

374
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,870
(talking over each other)

375
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,810
Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

376
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,540
Or five, it's debatable.

377
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,420
Depends on the
health of the people.

378
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,630
MATT: Next up in the initiative
order is Raishan.

379
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,810
LAURA: Oh, good.

380
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,270
MATT: So, as the splash happens,

381
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,060
you glance up and you
can see what looks to be

382
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,300
a series of maybe a dozen or
so of these volcanic lava tubes

383
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,750
that kind of are these--

384
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,240
these caverns roughly the
size of a very low live,

385
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,390
kind of pushed in
cat-like Raishan.

386
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,270
You see the head and the tail
kind of hanging out the side

387
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,119
as Raishan begins
to mutter some sort

388
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,690
of an incantation
under her breath.

389
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,750
You hear the echo...

390
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,240
(whispering incantation)

391
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,540
Between the room as it kind
of quivers for a second.

392
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,390
And her form
just vanishes.

393
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,840
TRAVIS: Damn it.

394
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,030
LIAM: But we saw where she was
before she went into--

395
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,270
MATT: You did.

396
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,480
SAM: Fight over, that's it.

397
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,480
That's great.

398
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,570
LAURA: Oh my God, she--
she ran away.

399
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,390
SAM: Alright, let's mop
up here and go home.

400
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,060
TRAVIS: Punk ass, Raishan.

401
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,720
MARISHA: The air ate her.

402
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,420
MATT: I guarantee you that's
probably not the case.

403
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,360
No.

404
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,600
TRAVIS: You're saying
there's a chance.

405
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,630
MATT: Yes.

406
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,840
Alrighty.

407
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,570
MARISHA: Dude.

408
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,420
TALIESIN: Just shunned her
into invisibility.

409
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,600
MATT: Great.

410
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,570
That brings us next
to Keyleth's turn.

411
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,240
LAURA: Keyleth, just kill her.

412
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,720
Find her and kill
her so we can get--

413
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,300
MARISHA: Whereabouts
was she last?

414
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,810
MATT: Last you saw was up
in this cavernous area

415
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,810
roughly in this
portion of the ceiling.

416
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,570
MARISHA: But we can assume she probably
went invisible and then moved.

417
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,870
LIAM: Yeah.

418
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,270
MARISHA: I could do Faerie Fire on her,

419
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,330
but I mean, I don't
know where she is

420
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,390
and it's a 20 foot cube.

421
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,660
It'd probably be a waste.

422
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,690
So, instead, I'm going
to cast Call Lightning

423
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,840
at fourth level,

424
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,840
and go fire elemental.

425
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,690
MATT: Okay.

426
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,180
-SAM: How's that work?
-LAURA: It's an ongoing--

427
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,120
Lightning is an ongoing--

428
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,690
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a concentration.

429
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,390
Yeah, I can make it--

430
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,030
SAM: So it just exists there?

431
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,420
-Ready to strike?
-TALIESIN: Like a ghostbuster.

432
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,690
SAM: Cool.

433
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,630
MATT: So, as you watch
Keyleth's eyes flare

434
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,060
with this bright electric
kind of blue yellow light,

435
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,450
as the ash and bit of dust

436
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
that has been kind of
plummeting from the ceiling

437
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,090
from the impact of
the meteor swarms

438
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,210
and the movement of some
now not seeable dragon

439
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,330
amongst the ceiling caverns.

440
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,180
It gathers into
this swirling storm

441
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,000
that begins to build
and form across the top

442
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,630
domed portion
of this cavern.

443
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,670
As it does, you watch bolts
of electricity...

444
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,210
Arc through the storm
as Keyleth's form

445
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,600
then whooshes into a burst
swirl of flaming energy.

446
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,660
Her physical body now becoming
a swirling fire elemental.

447
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,060
You wish to move or you're
gonna stay where you are?

448
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,480
MARISHA: I'm going to take a few
steps back and-- question.

449
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,150
Can I look up
and see if, like,

450
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,510
the clouds are kind of shaping
around like a, you know,

451
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,450
roughly
dragon shaped body?

452
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,690
That make sense?

453
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,570
TALIESIN: She's looking for
disturbances of the force.

454
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,540
MATT: Sure.

455
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,660
MARISHA: You gave me that
"this is bullshit" look.

456
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,090
TALIESIN: Roll a 29.

457
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,330
MARISHA: Oh, that's not bad.

458
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,510
With perception,
perception.

459
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,210
Sorry, I'm so nervous, 26.

460
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,510
MATT: Twenty-six.

461
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,810
Glancing about between
the dust that's falling,

462
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,600
the movement of the storm
that you've gathered

463
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,240
at the roof of the ceiling,

464
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,060
you don't see anything
that identifies

465
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,840
the location
of a dragon now.

466
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,300
MARISHA: Yeah, so it's fine.

467
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,750
So, I'll take a
few steps back.

468
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,970
MATT: So you're
about right there?

469
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,810
MARISHA: Yeah, oh, oh.

470
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,270
TALIESIN: Wow, it's
weirdly mirrored.

471
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,270
Okay, that
took me a second.

472
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,480
-MARISHA: It's totally mirrored.
-TALIESIN: Yeah!

473
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,690
LAURA: Oh!

474
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,300
-TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, cool.
-LIAM: Your screen is flipped.

475
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,000
-LAURA: That's crazy.
-MARISHA: It's fine.

476
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,030
It's not a problem.

477
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,300
TALIESIN: We have the
same view you do.

478
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,510
LAURA: It's actually, no,
I think it's better,

479
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,750
because we're looking at
it from his perspective.

480
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,030
TALIESIN: So, we can say
like, "move us down,"

481
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,090
and they'll be
towards him now.

482
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,540
Yeah.

483
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,510
-MARISHA: I'm sorry, so move me--
-MATT: Further in?

484
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,330
MARISHA: Yeah, down-- down.

485
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,150
SAM: Towards the lava
or away from the lava?

486
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,780
MARISHA: Right there,
down one more.

487
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,180
-Other way.
-TALIESIN: South.

488
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,570
-LAURA: Oh my God.
-MARISHA: South.

489
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,240
Yeah, that's good,
that's-- that's good.

490
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,360
-TALIESIN: There.
-MATT: Good, alright.

491
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,420
LAURA: Where's our pointer?

492
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,870
MATT: Where's your
laser pointers guys?

493
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,360
TALIESIN: Where are our pointers?

494
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,570
We need new pointers.

495
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,720
LAURA: It's been
three weeks, Matt.

496
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,840
MATT: It has been, I know.

497
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,030
SAM: We've forgotten how to play.

498
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,030
MATT: That's okay.

499
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,030
Alright, so--

500
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,150
MARISHA: It's like inverted controls.

501
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,660
TALIESIN: I'm taking Diva.

502
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,810
MATT: Now, is that your turn?

503
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,030
MARISHA: Yes.

504
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,870
MATT: Alright, finishing
Keyleth's turn.

505
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,240
That brings us to Gilmore
who's rushing up past--

506
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,540
LAURA: Come on, Gilmore.

507
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,750
MATT: Keeping up his pace
as much as he can.

508
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,480
"Oh, boy.

509
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,630
I know you guys take
me to the nicest places."

510
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,570
And he's just
jogging as best he can.

511
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,270
Rushing into the ash cloud

512
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,030
as another one pushes through.

513
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,210
Some of the wind
tending to push

514
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,600
and causing swirling little
dust devils of ash and cinder.

515
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,720
That's gonna
end his turn.

516
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,870
Vex, you're up.

517
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,000
LAURA: Oh.

518
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,550
-MATT: So you glance up.
-LAURA: I glance up.

519
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,030
MATT: You see all this happening,
what are you gonna do?

520
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,510
LAURA: I'm gonna get on my broom.

521
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,150
TALIESIN: Get on up.

522
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,570
LAURA: And I'm gonna
take a health potion.

523
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,910
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: So...

524
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,300
MATT: Regular health potion?

525
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,420
LAURA: I have a Greater.

526
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,720
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: I have one Greater.

527
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,780
So, that's a what?

528
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,750
4d8?

529
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,480
MATT: A Greater is 4d4 plus four.

530
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,770
Remember you guys
are pretty low

531
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,780
on any powerful
potions at this point.

532
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,330
You used most
of them, so, yeah.

533
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,560
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, I had
a Greater left.

534
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,090
It's jack shit.

535
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,240
Ten, ten whole points.

536
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,090
MATT: There you go,
ten points of healing.

537
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,390
On your broom.

538
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,570
LAURA: I'm gonna go back
towards the entrance.

539
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,030
Post up to the entrance,

540
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,420
like off the ground
as far as I can get.

541
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,390
MATT: That's about as
far as you can get.

542
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,660
You want to stay hovering or
just like there on the ground?

543
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,000
LAURA: Hovering!

544
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,390
Stay off the ground
and can I--

545
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,570
MATT: Are you going up
ten feet or 20 feet

546
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,510
or are you staying
just above the ground

547
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,180
so you're not
standing on it?

548
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,330
LAURA: I'm gonna go up ten feet.

549
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,930
MATT: Okay.

550
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,480
LAURA: And if I can be a little bit
further away from Keyleth,

551
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,510
that'd be clutch.

552
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,720
MATT: Okay.

553
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,760
LAURA: I mean, I don't know
if it'd be clutch,

554
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,030
but it would be helpful.

555
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,150
Can I look up,

556
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,240
and see if
I can see like,

557
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,120
dust coming down
from any of the holes,

558
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,760
to see if Raishan is moving around

559
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,510
in the holes
on the ceiling--

560
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,060
MATT: Roll a perception check.

561
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,390
LIAM: There's a storm cloud.

562
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,090
LAURA: I know, I know.

563
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,210
Is this
pertaining to dragons

564
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,670
so I would
get advantage?

565
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,640
MATT: Sure.

566
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,690
-LAURA: That's the same thing.
-LIAM: Two 13's.

567
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,240
LAURA: So, perception,
so that's 26.

568
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,660
MATT: Okay, so glancing
about, unfortunately,

569
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,810
the gathering of the
Call Lightning cloud

570
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,090
combined with the other
dark ash-filled interior,

571
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,240
you don't see anything
that signifies

572
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,810
the location
of a dragon.

573
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,540
You do glance over
and you notice

574
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,240
that where you
landed previously,

575
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,020
one of the eggs was pretty
much just destroyed by this--

576
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,240
'cause it was the area
of the meteor swarm

577
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,630
where you guys were hit.

578
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,780
So, all gathered here,

579
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,390
so this egg right here
by where you were,

580
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,870
is currently just crushed
inward and filled with rock.

581
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,070
-MARISHA: And--
-LAURA: Really?

582
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,770
Is there anything
oozing out of it?

583
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,240
MARISHA: Yeah, what's--

584
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,450
LAURA: I should have
looked at it before.

585
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,180
MATT: It's hard to see,
it's far away,

586
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,480
but it looks like the
egg has been destroyed.

587
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,660
-LAURA: Destroyed?
-SAM: Destroyed?

588
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,180
LAURA: She doesn't care
about the eggs.

589
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,870
SAM: Or she didn't destroy it.

590
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,720
LIAM: Not the Mama!

591
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,030
LAURA: Okay, so I've got--
I'm so sorry.

592
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,390
MARISHA: That's true.

593
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,720
TRAVIS: So, it's covered with rocks.

594
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,780
LAURA: I don't know
where my notes are

595
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,630
to see what my
spells were from before.

596
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,890
I didn't have it set up
cause I'm a horrible person.

597
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,600
MARISHA: But that was
from the lair action.

598
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,190
SAM: Yeah, that wasn't her.

599
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,150
LAURA: Okay, this is--
this is the last one.

600
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,030
Oh, I didn't do like
any spells before.

601
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,240
So, I'm gonna cast--

602
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm gonna cast
Cure Wounds on myself.

603
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,480
MATT: Okay.

604
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,060
What level?

605
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,480
MARISHA: Yeah, but does she
care or even not care?

606
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,540
TALIESIN: We'll find out.

607
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,810
LAURA: I'm gonna cast
it at third level.

608
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,720
MATT: Okay.

609
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,330
LAURA: So, that's 1d8-- 2d8 plus
my spell casting modifier.

610
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,210
-MATT: So, a 3d8 technically.
-LAURA: 3d8?

611
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,230
MATT: Cause if you're
casting at third level,

612
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,990
it's 3d8 plus your spell modifier.

613
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,750
LAURA: Okay.

614
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,300
TRAVIS: That's good,
that's good, that's good.

615
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,150
MARISHA: This is turning into
a Jerry Springer episode.

616
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,090
Is she or is
she not the mom?

617
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,300
LAURA: No, my modifier, which is my wisdom.

618
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,210
Ten plus--

619
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,090
Jesus Christ,
I'm sorry!

620
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Ten plus--

621
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,240
TALIESIN: Three weeks, man.

622
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,630
LAURA: Thirteen points heal.

623
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,870
MARISHA: It's like riding a bike,
riding a bike.

624
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,450
LIAM: Three weeks to
stew, everybody.

625
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,450
MATT: Alright, there you go.

626
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,060
At the end of your turn--

627
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,600
Actually she's gonna do--

628
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,840
TALIESIN: It's like riding a
bike with pen and paper.

629
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,450
MATT: Okay.

630
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,270
You feel this strange,

631
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,040
sudden warm tingling sensation

632
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,720
separate from the healing spell
just in your vicinity.

633
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,100
Almost like a warm breeze
just kind of passes through you.

634
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,330
That's it.

635
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,030
-SAM: Oh, boy.
-MATT: End of your turn.

636
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,060
-SAM: What does that mean?
-LAURA: I don't know.

637
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,510
SAM: You've been
cursed forever.

638
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,660
-TRAVIS: It's a bloody fart.
-TALIESIN: Farting dragon.

639
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,690
Invisible
farting dragon.

640
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,210
LAURA: What if that
was a baby dragon?

641
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,570
LIAM: I'm gonna take to the air.

642
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,330
I'm going to-- do I
still feel hasted yet?

643
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,840
MATT: You-- yes, you do.

644
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,240
LIAM: I'm going to
fly past my sister

645
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,120
and slap the one Greater healing
potion I have into her palm.

646
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,760
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

647
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,240
LIAM: Oh, Superior,
excuse me.

648
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,570
LAURA: What?!

649
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,810
LIAM: And then
I'm going to

650
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,690
curve around over Keyleth

651
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,150
and stab the egg there with
the Dragon Slayer blade.

652
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,730
-SAM: Oh, boy.
-MATT: This one?

653
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,000
-LIAM: Yes.
-MATT: Okay.

654
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,030
SAM: Stabbing eggs?

655
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,310
TALIESIN: That should give you a
Dragon Slayer bonus also.

656
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,070
MATT: Go ahead and
roll for attack.

657
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,660
TRAVIS: Isn't that poaching?

658
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,360
LIAM: That is 29.

659
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,120
MATT: That hits.

660
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,210
SAM: Go home Travis, you're drunk.

661
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,550
TRAVIS: I'm working on it.

662
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,710
LAURA: The babies will
help us though.

663
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,360
What if the
babies are cute?

664
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,870
-Can we raise them?
-TALIESIN: No.

665
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,060
MARISHA: You want to try and
Daenerys this shit?

666
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,480
TALIESIN: We can raise them
by setting them on fire.

667
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,510
MARISHA: We each get one, you guys.

668
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,720
LIAM: Twenty-six.

669
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,450
MATT: Twenty-six
points of damage.

670
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,300
Alright, you take the
blade as you rush up

671
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,300
and then hack through it.

672
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,120
The blade only
gets a few inches

673
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,240
into the tough outer
exterior of this egg

674
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,660
and you have to push
and carve through

675
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,000
and you do carve a--

676
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,570
a sliver through the egg's shell
and a little bit of

677
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,600
deep, brownish-maroon liquid

678
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,450
begins to spill out
of it, but that's--

679
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,720
it's not a heavy amount
of damage to the egg.

680
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,750
LIAM: I'm gonna take Whisper
and take that further.

681
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,750
MATT: Go ahead and roll for a
secondary attack.

682
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,610
-LIAM: That is 28 to hit.
-MATT: 28, that hits.

683
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,450
I'll mark the eggs that
are damaged and destroyed.

684
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,930
This one is...

685
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,390
LIAM: That's a total of 15.

686
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,180
MATT: Oh, that's not
working too well.

687
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,150
Good to know. Total of what?

688
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,630
-LIAM: Fifteen.
-MATT: Fifteen, okay.

689
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,390
With that much damage, the egg
begins to crack even further.

690
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,750
More of the liquid
begins to spill.

691
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,360
The blade pulls through
and you can see,

692
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,480
as you tear a chunk
of the actual shell

693
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,510
of this egg off
and it falls,

694
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,740
you have punctured some
sort of thick amniotic sac.

695
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,030
That's what the fluid
that's spilling out of it,

696
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,030
but you haven't
seemingly touched

697
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,860
any sort of flesh
or creature within,

698
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,690
but the egg is currently has
a section that is exposed.

699
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,180
LIAM: And I have--if
I'm still hasted,

700
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,540
I have a lot of
movement left,

701
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,480
so I'm going
to fly and hover

702
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,570
about 15 feet above
the egg towards you,

703
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,720
towards your DM tape
on the side there.

704
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,210
-MATT: Over here?
-LIAM: Yeah.

705
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,360
MATT: Okay.

706
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,480
LIAM: Fifteen feet
in the air.

707
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,510
♪

708
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,030
I have 120 feet of
movement total hasted.

709
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,510
LAURA: So, we were lining up?

710
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,630
We're seriously lining up?

711
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,120
LIAM: No, I'm all the
way over there.

712
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,690
-LAURA: No, you're in a line.
-LIAM: That's not where I want to be.

713
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,740
I want to be--

714
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,390
MATT: I know, I'm-- I'm calculating
how much movement you have.

715
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,720
LIAM: I'm arguing with
her, not you.

716
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,370
MATT: Ah, no worries.

717
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,140
LIAM: Cause that's what we do
cause we love each other.

718
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,300
MATT: You can get
right there.

719
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,480
LIAM: Okay.

720
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,030
Fifteen feet
in the air.

721
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,620
MATT: Fifteen feet
in the air?

722
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,300
LIAM: That's not the egg that
I'm talking about though.

723
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,840
LAURA: Look, I'm talking about--

724
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,330
LIAM: I'm talking about
the egg closer to Matt.

725
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,490
LAURA: Yes, there it is.

726
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,920
-LIAM: There.
-LAURA: That one!

727
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,240
LIAM: This is where
I want to go.

728
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,000
LAURA: That's where
you are, dude.

729
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
LIAM: That's over there?

730
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,450
LAURA: Yeah, it's reverse.

731
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,150
LIAM: It's the--it's the
flip screen is--

732
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,270
I don't want
to go there.

733
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,120
I want to go across
from everybody.

734
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,330
It's the flip.

735
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,630
SAM: Guys, just don't
look at the TV.

736
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,120
Look at the screen.

737
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,060
MATT: Over this way?

738
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,150
TRAVIS: Closer, Matt?

739
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,030
LIAM: I'm gonna kill you all.

740
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,780
MATT: Bare with this, new tech.

741
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,840
New year, we're
making this work.

742
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,780
LIAM: There, there.

743
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,240
The egg that's there.

744
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
TALIESIN: I have a brilliant solution
for this for next time.

745
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,510
MATT: So, from there-- yeah.

746
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,660
You wouldn't be
able to make it there.

747
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,570
LIAM: Literally, in game.

748
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,750
SAM: Invert controls.

749
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
TRAVIS: It's like a jet fighter.

750
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,660
-MARISHA: Battleship.
-TALIESIN: We can Battleship it.

751
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,510
Next time, next time, we'll
just have a row of letters

752
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,690
and a row of numbers.

753
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,600
-Says move me up to L7.
-LAURA: I can't use inverted controls.

754
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,190
SAM: I only use inverted.

755
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,630
LAURA: Really?

756
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,840
TALIESIN: Isn't that a great idea?

757
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,120
MATT: Destroyed.

758
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,270
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

759
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,450
MATT: This egg has one
crack in the side there.

760
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,390
Okay.

761
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,240
LAURA: Did you just mark
on your cool eggs?

762
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,760
TRAVIS: He's using dry erase.

763
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,570
MATT: Wet erase and, you know. It's fun.

764
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,480
TALIESIN: It's either that
or lick them.

765
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,460
SAM: How many more times are we
gonna play

766
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,360
with dragon eggs in a year?

767
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,270
TRAVIS: Did you have us on
tiny plastic eggs?

768
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,720
MATT: Yeah, so I ordered
way too many.

769
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,680
I put a bunch in my cart
to make sure that I--

770
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,130
I didn't know
which one to get

771
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,600
and then forgot about it,
came back and was like,

772
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,090
"Oh shit, I got
to order that."

773
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,740
Ended up buying
like three bags full.

774
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,510
TALIESIN: What am I gonna do
with all these eggs?

775
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,180
MATT: We'll have egg
plastic giveaways.

776
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,780
That ends
your turn, Vax?

777
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,300
Alright.

778
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,210
At the end of
your turn, Vax,

779
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,670
you feel the effect of
the haste potion dissipate

780
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,570
and your body, all of a sudden,
goes from this hyperactive,

781
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,570
very familiar mode
to extremely lethargic

782
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,770
and you find yourself having
to fight to catch your breath.

783
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,330
So, you can't take
any actions next turn.

784
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,920
-Can't do anything.
-LAURA: Oh, it's the potion.

785
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,660
MATT: It's the potion,
it's not the boots.

786
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,780
LIAM: The boots, right.

787
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,240
MATT: Kima is trying to keep
up pace with you, Grog.

788
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,570
You're still in
your large form.

789
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,060
How long's that last for?

790
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,930
TRAVIS: Let me check.

791
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,330
Enlarge: 10 minutes.

792
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,710
MATT: Yeah, alright, so you're
like bounding through.

793
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,210
Kima's falling behind.

794
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,750
As you guys both enter,
and continue past

795
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
you hear the explosions in the
distance and all of a sudden,

796
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,180
the rolling of smoke
and ash rushes past you.

797
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,380
The smell
doesn't bother you

798
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,540
cause you've had the smell
of burning beard hair

799
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,390
most of this
close to your nose.

800
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,660
What was once your
great bush beard

801
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,410
is a little tighter
to your face now.

802
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,480
TRAVIS: What?

803
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,600
You've taken a few dragon fire breaths

804
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,090
to the face.

805
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,360
The fact that
you have any hair

806
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,120
is by the grace of your
ancestral history.

807
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,510
That Dwarven
belt you have.

808
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,560
TRAVIS: I know, that's why it's so precious.

809
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,960
MATT: But are you just going full sprint

810
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,390
to catch up
with everybody?

811
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,840
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-MATT: Alright.

812
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,990
TRAVIS: I'll just roll it.

813
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,000
I still have
Pike with me, right?

814
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,330
MATT: Pike is coming
with you, yeah.

815
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,450
'Cause you picked her up.

816
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,540
so you're just
running with Pike.

817
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,690
Kima's just
like, "Damn it!"

818
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,030
Left in the ash.

819
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,480
You, while you were behind,
you, with your full speed,

820
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,600
being faster than everybody
else in this group,

821
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,030
you almost catch up entirely
to Percy and Gilmore

822
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,060
and pretty much on their
initiative count going forward,

823
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,150
or at least of the arrival
count in the next round.

824
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,600
That finishes your go.

825
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,180
Let's see.

♪

827
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,720
You were after Vax, right?

828
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,570
TRAVIS: Yes, no, no, I was
right before Vax.

829
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,060
MATT: Right, so I got a little out
of order, sorry, my apologies.

830
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,120
Alright, so anyway, it wouldn't
have made a difference.

831
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,720
So Kima goes for a run. Pike.

832
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,870
Is Pike doing
anything on your back?

is she Yoda-ing you?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

843
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,020
MARISHA: Is it like a Yoda
situation, that's awesome.

844
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,270
TRAVIS: The force.

845
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,630
That was terrible.

awful, actually.

847

(talking over each other)

SAM: Hi, I'm Yoda.

849
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,720
TRAVIS: I think that's
his brother, Carl.

850

at third level on him.

song is so great.

LAURA: So, that's three d8's.

they've done in a while.

TALIESIN: One of the best things

Sixteen plus her page, her modifier.

Five, so add five to that.

my 25 feet,

871
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,719
and then pop a potion.

872
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,600
Just a normal potion of healing
'cause that's all I got.

Ooh.

five hit points.

anything else on your turn?

Are you dashing?

SAM: Can I use my action to dash?

884
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,060
MATT: Yes, your action to
move again, essentially.

885
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,270
SAM: Okay.

886
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,000

looking down at the egg.

It's already a hot, like
you're all sweating in here,

like, warm briefly comparatively
to the temperature around you

your attention.

It doesn't hurt

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,210
There's still a bonus action
if you have any use for it, so.

937
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,180
TALIESIN: I don't really have--

938
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,780
Mostly I just want to
use my bonus action

939
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,060
to take in everything and
look around and have a--

940
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,780
have a good, good
serious look.

941
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,720
In fact, I'll even
take a perception roll

942
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,940
if I can have one.

943
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,420
-MATT: Go for it.
-TALIESIN: Okay.

944
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,450
SAM: Just a good
sit and think.

945
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,720
TALIESIN: Let's get-- okay,
no never mind.

946
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,810
That's pretty good.

947
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,540
Wow, it has been a while.

948
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,060
-Twenty-five.
-MATT: Twenty-five.

949
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,450
Glancing around,
you see a fire elemental

950
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,120
that briefly startles you

951
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,360
as you kind of whip
around in that direction,

952
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,810
but you recognize--

953
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,600
MARISHA: And like, it's got
antlers, and I'm like...

954
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,120
(grunts)

955
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,390
TALIESIN: I love Hannibal
too, it's great.

956
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,540
Okay.

957
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,540
Eggs, dust.

958
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,600
MATT: Yeah, you see eggs.

959
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,330
One is destroyed
and just leaking out

960
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,780
and like a series
of boulders

961
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,420
and what looks like
some sort of a large,

962
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,510
concave impression on the top.

963
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,420
There are eggs scattered
throughout the area.

964
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,120
There's a giant
storm cloud gathering

965
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,090
in the roof of the cavern,

966
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,720
and there is the
large pool of lava

967
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,240
with the small
pool over there.

968
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,480
You see occasional glimmers

969
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,180
of what look like
coin in the distance.

970
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,180
TALIESIN: Can you put me,
like, on the wall

971
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,540
just cause I don't
think I'd be--

972
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,120
I was still spider crawling
so even

973
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,540
on top of the little
wall thing, if you want.

974
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,840
MATT: Sure, I'll
put you there.

975
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,030
Sure, why not, Percy?

976
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,090
-TALIESIN: Thank you.
-MATT: You're welcome.

977
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,420
TALIESIN: That makes me happy.

978
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,060
LIAM: How high is it to these
holes in the ceiling from--

979
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,330
MATT: I'd say it's
about 60, 70 feet up?

980
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,270
-LAURA: Okay.
-TALIESIN: Cool, cool.

981
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,600
MATT: Yeah, the whole cavern's
kind of domed like this.

982
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,780
Alrighty, then,
that's Percy's turn.

983
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,030
Another lair action's
going to transpire.

984
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,270
SAM: Oh.

985
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,330
This one's a good one.

986
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,480
This one heals everybody.

987
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,330
MATT: Yeah.

988
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,420
There is a fissure
that erupts

989
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,660
over in this
side of the room.

990
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,000
The ground kind of
cracks open and this--

991
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,150
You've seen
it happen once.

992
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,840
A plume of poisonous gas
fills this space here.

993
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,090
LAURA: It's okay, we're
immune to poison.

994
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,360
MATT: Let's see.

995
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,660
I need-- I need you, Vex,

996
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,840
to make a constitution
saving throw.

997
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,630
LAURA: Even I'm immune to poison?

998
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,480
Oh, no.

999
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,480
MARISHA: Really?

1000
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,510
Even with Hero's Feast?

1001
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
-SAM: Oh, no.
-MARISHA: Oh, shit.

1002
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,870
LAURA: I got plus two
for the ring.

1003
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,240
So, 11.

1004
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,360
SAM: Eleven.

1005
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,540
MATT: Okay, good, I'll
keep that in mind.

1006
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,300
TALIESIN: That's a number.

1007
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,750
MATT: Okay.

1008
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,750
It is now...

1009
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,360
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

1010
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,120
What does it mean?

1011
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,360
LAURA: Slowly my skin starts
to melt off my body.

1012
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,420
MATT: Yeah, you just-- the cloud
kind of fills the area

1013
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,330
and you start
coughing, that's it.

1014
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,840
It hasn't gone your turn yet,
so, it is now Raishan's turn.

1015
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,870
Legendary actions
are restored.

1016
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,600
TALIESIN: I hate all of this.

1017
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,600
Oh, good, I was worried
about her legendary actions.

1018
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,180
♪

1019
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,450
MARISHA: Are you being facetious?

1020
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,880
TALIESIN: I don't know
what that means.

1021
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,330
LAURA: Who's turn is
it right now?

1022
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,030
-It's Raishan's?
-MATT: It's Raishan's turn.

1023
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,720
Deciding what to do.

1024
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,840
Okay.

1025
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,360
TALIESIN: I don't know the
meaning of the word.

1026
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,690
MATT: Um...

1027
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,270
SAM: This is fun.

1028
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,330
Just good, clean fun.

1029
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,810
MATT: Percival.

1030
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,750
SAM: Oh.

1031
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,180
MATT: As you're running
along the wall,

1032
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,600
and you glance in the vicinity,

1033
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,090
you see the cloud of poison
kind of burst from the ground

1034
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,270
and you're just
out of the range of it.

1035
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,370
I'm sorry, it's just within
your range from where the--

1036
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,120
TALIESIN: I'm wearing my mask.

1037
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,660
MATT: Yeah, you have
your mask on.

1038
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,150
TALIESIN: I don't know if it actually
helps, but there we are.

1039
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,950
TRAVIS: You look fabulous.

1040
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,270
MATT:So, as you're standing
kind of amongst this--

1041
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,720
this fume, you see this
within this, this cloud,

1042
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,120
a kind of strange burst of very,
very faint light in your area

1043
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,270
and you feel, even
in this heated room,

1044
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,780
a sudden surge of heat within
your kind of torso region

1045
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,150
and then it fades.

1046
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,030
LAURA: What does it mean?!

1047
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,090
It's freaking me
the fuck out.

1048
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,740
TRAVIS: She's blazing us, ya'll.
She's lighting us up.

1049
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,380
LAURA: What if it's like--

1050
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,030
TRAVIS: Doesn't Hunter's Mark feel
like something sometimes?

1051
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,570
LAURA: Oh my God,
that's right.

1052
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,770
What if she's like marking
us for death or something?

1053
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,760
MATT: You now can faintly
hear what sounds like...

1054
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,480
There are footsteps moving
through the tunnels,

1055
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,840
but you're unable
in the current chaos

1056
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,090
and the obscured vision
to see where it's happening

1057
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,210
but there is movement happening
above you throughout the cavern.

1058
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,660
TALIESIN: My save versus magic

1059
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,330
would not help
with this at all.

1060
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Cabal's Ruin would
not help with this.

1061
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,600
Okay, just check.

1062
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,000
MATT: Okay.

1063
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,150
That ends Raishan's turn.

1064
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,870
That's gonna bring
us to Keyleth.

1065
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,390
MARISHA: Okay.

1066
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,150
Really unsure of what's going
on, so I'm just going to...

1067
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
TRAVIS: Laser pointer right here.

1068
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,240
LAURA: Laser pointer.

1069
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,810
MARISHA: Thank you.

1070
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,270
I'm gonna go to that egg right
here that Vax was wailing on.

1071
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,510
-MATT: Yep.
-MARISHA: And try and finish it off.

1072
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,540
MATT: Okay, you move up and as
you get to the edge of it,

1073
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,120
you can see now the light
that your body's giving off.

1074
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,780
So, the fire elemental
is glinting off of piles

1075
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,840
of gold and platinum that are
kind of gathered around the egg.

1076
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,750
About a third of it is
still submerged in volcanic rock

1077
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,630
and has been placed
here for quite some time.

1078
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,060
LAURA: Don't let me die,
I need to loot.

1079
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,810
MATT: You can see the crack in
the exterior of the egg

1080
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,570
and the kind of thick
purplish amniotic fluid

1081
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,000
that is slowly dribbling
down like a--

1082
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,240
like a slow moving molasses

1083
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,300
or sap from the wound
left behind by Vax.

1084
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,150
MARISHA: I'm gonna do
two slam attacks.

1085
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,870
-MATT: Go for it.
-MARISHA: Multi attack.

1086
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,450
Uh, wait.

1087
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,090
Those were
both nine's.

1088
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,570
Which is--
so 15 total.

1089
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,210
-To hit?
-MATT: Fifteen to hit?

1090
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,360
It does hit, yes.

1091
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,030
MARISHA: Okay, and that is--

1092
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,180
MATT: Only because he pre-damaged
it to that point.

1093
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,480
You're basically attacking
through the shell of the egg.

1094
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,630
Removed a portion of
its armor, so otherwise--

1095
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,090
TALIESIN: You're punching a
dragon fetus right now.

1096
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,210
MARISHA: I am totally
punching a dragon--

1097
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,600
TALIESIN: That's like
so eggs benedict.

1098
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,330
MARISHA: Plus six,
so that's a ten.

1099
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,750
Fourteen,
eighteen damage.

1100
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,720
MATT: Okay.

1101
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,270
So, you plunge your
flaming fist into the fluid.

1102
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,360
You hear it immediately sizzle
as your fist goes into it.

1103
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,150
You punch something
dense on the inside.

1104
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,600
(groaning)

1105
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,690
LAURA: Oh, you punched
a baby dragon.

1106
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,270
LIAM: Good.

1107
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,750
LAURA: "Good."

1108
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,690
-MARISHA: Okay, that's my turn.
-LAURA: In the head.

1109
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,750
MATT: You did both of
those slam attacks?

1110
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,630
MARISHA: Those were both--
those my attacks.

1111
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,030
MATT: You rolled a 15 and a--

1112
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,570
MARISHA: I rolled two nine's
and I have a plus six.

1113
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
-MATT: Oh!
-MARISHA: I rolled both of 'em twice.

1114
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,000
MATT: Oh, oh, so you
rolled 15 both times.

1115
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,060
-MARISHA: Yes.
-MATT: Got you.

1116
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,180
Then how much damage
did you total?

1117
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,540
-MARISHA: Eighteen.
-MATT: Eighteen from both attacks?

1118
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,510
-MARISHA: Yes.
-MATT: Okay, cool.

1119
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,750
Alright, so,
with both slams,

1120
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,780
the first fist goes in and
slams and hits something.

1121
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,450
The second time you
reach in and slamming,

1122
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,090
you grab it and pull out,

1123
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,000
as you kind of yank out of
the egg just a little bit,

1124
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:15,870
you see what looks
like the snout of a very

1125
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,420
tiny Thordak essentially.

1126
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,630
But whereas the red dragon
you saw Thordak,

1127
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,120
that was like
partially volcanic,

1128
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,450
crystalline with
the burning eyes,

1129
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,810
this creature
is seemingly made

1130
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,600
from pure primordial
fire and rock.

1131
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,300
This is a whole
new form of dragon.

1132
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,510
MARISHA: He made them clones.

1133
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,870
LAURA: What if he made--
what if it's one

1134
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,210
for every member
of the Conclave?

1135
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,360
MARISHA: How many are there?

1136
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,030
LAURA: There's five eggs,
but one is crushed

1137
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,210
and that would be Raishan and
there would be nothing in it.

1138
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,540
SAM: What?

1139
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,120
MARISHA: Wait, are we sure
there was nothing in it?

1140
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,480
LAURA: I don't know.

1141
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,030
MARISHA: Do you want to go check and see
if there was something in it?

1142
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,390
TRAVIS: Covered in rock,
we can't see.

1143
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,780
MARISHA: Are there five--
there are five eggs?

1144
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,210
SAM: Or he was making their
own basketball team.

1145
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,020
MATT: There are five eggs
that you can see currently.

1146
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,780
LIAM: And they're all red,
they're all red.

1147
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,810
MATT: They're all red, yes.

1148
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,860
LAURA: Okay, well,
they're all red.

1149
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,030
Maybe they're
all Thordak's.

1150
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,810
MARISHA: They're little clones?

1151
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,060
TALIESIN: If they're clones, maybe it's

1152
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,120
literally five new
breeds of dragon.

1153
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,120
LAURA: Oh my God.

1154
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,300
TRAVIS: Only one way
to find out.

1155
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,630
MARISHA: Yeah, only one
way to find out.

1156
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,570
-Let's bust open another one.
-LAURA: Is it still alive?

1157
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,630
TALIESIN: What do you call the
little chocolate eggs?

1158
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,780
LAURA: Is it alive?

1159
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,660
MARISHA: Is it alive or did
I kind of kill it by--

1160
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,360
MATT: You kind of killed it.

1161
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,390
It's currently
limp in your grasp.

1162
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,450
SAM: Hey, you killed a dragon.

1163
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,450
LAURA: Good job.

1164
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,720
MARISHA: "I did it!

1165
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,080
I got one!"

1166
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,960
MATT: Keyleth, the
dragon snapper.

1167
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,390
TALIESIN: This is the like the Westworld
version of killing a dragon.

1168
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,340
SAM: How do you want to do this?

1169
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,450
Sunny side up.

1170
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,090
(laughing)

1171
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,420
TALIESIN: Benedict.

1172
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,420
MATT: Perfect.

1173
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,540
You still have
some movement, Keyleth,

1174
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,000
if you want
to move still.

1175
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,570
MARISHA: I do, don't I.

1176
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,360
I want to start
heading towards Vax.

1177
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,720
MATT: Towards Vax
this way, okay.

1178
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,810
What's your movement
in fire elemental form?

1179
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,030
-MARISHA: Fifty feet.
-MATT: Fifty feet?

1180
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,100
You get about there, however,
unaffected by fire and--

1181
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,060
MARISHA: And I'm, like, hovering.

1182
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,630
MATT: You're comfortable in this.

1183
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,600
-MARISHA: It's like a spa.
-MATT: Kinda yeah.

1184
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,980
-It's tingly.
-MARISHA: It's like a hot spring.

1185
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,140
MATT: It's perfect.

1186
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,390
Alright, that
ends your turn.

1187
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,510
Gilmore, just at a full run
gets up to the side here,

1188
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,720
and is kind of flanking.

1189
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,690
He enters the space,
pushes up against the wall

1190
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,550
and just kind of
surveys the territory.

1191
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,510
He looks spooked but
also kind of in that,

1192
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,210
"Well, we're here"
type mentality.

1193
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,180
Looks about the room and
goes, "Everyone all right?

1194
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,240
Please tell me
everyone's all right."

1195
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,150
(coughing)

1196
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,390
(whimpering)

1197
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,120
"Great."

1198
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,330
That ends Gilmore's
turn as he just arrives.

1199
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,630
Grog.

1200
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,300
(roars)

1201
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,150
You just come sprinting in.

1202
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,570
TRAVIS: Can I smack Shaun's
ass as I go by?

1203
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,030
Going, "Come on, Shaun."

1204
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,750
-MATT: Sure.
-LIAM: Shaun breaks in half.

1205
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,660
MATT: You aren't stealthy,
and as you run by,

1206
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,540
Shaun sees you about
to swing and goes like,

1207
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,150
"Fine."

1208
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,540
Whack!

1209
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,480
Might have
dislocated his hip.

1210
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:15,480
He's like...

1211
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,000
(strained laugh)

1212
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,150
"I'll charge you later."

1213
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,870
LAURA: That's gonna be a bruise
on the ass for sure.

1214
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,810
MATT: You get about there
and you are--

1215
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,420
Pike is technically
on your space,

1216
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,240
kind of clutching
to your shoulders.

1217
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,210
We'll say back here.

1218
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,810
Little Yoda backpack.

1219
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,390
TRAVIS: Do I get any
additional movement

1220
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,810
or am I just here now?

1221
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,810
MATT: You are a little
bit behind everybody.

1222
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,540
You've just now caught up to
everybody, and that's--

1223
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,630
Just your full double run

1224
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,240
and you just arrived
at the edge of the map.

1225
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,750
TRAVIS: "I'm here.

1226
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,440
Let the piñatas begin."

1227
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,220
SAM: "Okay, what's a piñata?"

1228
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,660
TRAVIS: "I don't know, I thought
it was a celebration.

1229
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,420
-Is it not?"
-MARISHA: You should ask Sam.

1230
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,600
SAM: Hola, me llamo Sam Riegel.

1231
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,060
MARISHA: Yeah, there you go.

1232
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,270
TALIESIN: ¿Donde está la biblioteca?

1233
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,300
MATT: Alright, that'll
bring us to Vex's turn.

1234
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,120
LAURA: Oh, okay, alright.

1235
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,030
MATT: At the top of your turn,

1236
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,870
the poison has
filled your lungs

1237
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,660
and while you
suffer no damage,

1238
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,330
you are incapacitated.

1239
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,090
You are just in
a coughing fit,

1240
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,390
almost falling
off of your broom.

1241
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,720
Like sliding off
to the side and just...

1242
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,270
(coughing)

1243
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,540
And you just
can't do anything.

1244
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,240
-LAURA: I can't do anything?
-MATT: Nope.

1245
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,000
LAURA: It was a whole
fucking turn?

1246
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,300
-MATT: Yep.
-LAURA: Gone.

1247
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:33,510
MARISHA: So, both the
twins have no turns.

1248
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,780
LAURA: Okay.

1249
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,150
MATT: The poison has
completely filled you

1250
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,480
to the point
where you're seizing.

1251
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,600
You feel the muscles
tightening up, and--

1252
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,180
LAURA: It's not hurting me--

1253
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,690
MATT: It's not hurting you, but
you're unable to do anything.

1254
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,870
TRAVIS: Sulfurous gas.

1255
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,300
It wrecks your shit.

1256
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,840
LIAM: Welcome to Hot Pepper Gaming.

1257
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,240
LAURA: That's good,
because you know what?

1258
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,540
I didn't have
anything planned

1259
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,840
and it would have been a
cluster fuck like last time,

1260
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,450
so fuck it.

1261
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,540
MATT: Vax.

1262
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,330
You currently
are just kinda like...

1263
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,720
(gasping)

1264
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,690
Taking a breath, your vision
kind of blurs for a moment

1265
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,480
and you can see the double
vision trying to align.

1266
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,060
It comes in to focus

1267
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,450
and you see Keyleth's
fire elemental form

1268
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,810
kind of gliding across.

1269
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,720
You see the edge of your
sister currently shadowed

1270
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,420
against this cloud of toxic, sulfurous gas

1271
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,060
that is spewed up
from the ground.

1272
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,920
You can hear her
coughing in the distance.

1273
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,560
You see a bunch
of your allies

1274
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,600
now beginning
to just show up

1275
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,120
on the outside of the
room's kind of lit interior,

1276
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,360
and it takes you
the full round

1277
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,570
to kind of
catch your breath.

1278
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,060
LIAM: No movement either, yeah?

1279
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,120
MATT: Let me double
check actually.

1280
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,570
I'm pretty sure...

1281
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,840
Let me see here.

1282
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:38,780
♪

1283
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,150
Can't move or take actions
until next turn, so no.

1284
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,090
Alright, so that ends
the end of Vax's turn.

1285
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,240
Let's see, at the
end of your turn.

1286
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,810
There is going to be...

1287
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,240
LIAM: This is fucking--

1288
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,510
(indistinct whispering)

1289
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,250
SAM: Did I--did I get a turn?

1290
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,450
No, I did mine already.

1291
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,120
MATT: Yeah, we're gonna
get to yours.

1292
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,290
LIAM: I'm still in the same position
15 feet up that I was.

1293
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,150
MATT: You are, yes.

1294
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,730
Yeah, your wings
are just like...

1295
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,600
Grog, you see this
kind of faint glimmer

1296
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,240
of energy around you

1297
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,120
and you instinctually
kind of like...

1298
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,150
(grunts)

1299
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,240
(growls)

1300
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,330
But no temperature change.

1301
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,710
Nothing seems to happen.

1302
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,210
TRAVIS: Do I smell anything?

1303
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,450
MATT: You smell sweaty gnome on metal armor.

1304
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,300
-LAURA: "Sorry."
-TRAVIS: "Honestly, really?

1305
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,540
I mean, come on."

1306
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,750
LIAM: "I'm just a little
nervous is all."

1307
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,780
TRAVIS: "Did you eat mustard pretzels
before this, my god?"

1308
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,570
LIAM: "Maybe."

1309
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,150
LAURA: "You know how
they make me calm."

1310
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,550
TRAVIS: Calm?

1311
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,450
SAM: Double Ashley is
the best Ashley.

1312
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,630
MATT: Kima's running, desperately
trying to catch up.

1313
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,000
But she's not quite
in the battlefield yet.

1314
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,420
It's Pike's go.

1315
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,720
LIAM: Pike, Pike,
it's your turn.

1316
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,330
LAURA: Okay, okay.

1317
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,090
LIAM: Yeah, let's buff everybody.

1318
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,510
LAURA: Yeah, so she's gonna cast--
what she should do mass--

1319
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,780
MARISHA: Is there anything
that could help

1320
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,630
with the stuff that has
been magically cast on us?

1321
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,780
TALIESIN: We don't actually
know what's been done.

1322
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,510
LAURA: Oh, on everybody
and it's 30 feet.

1323
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,060
How far--

1324
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,330
Can she move up and get--

1325
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,060
How many people can
she get in a 30 foot cone?

1326
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,510
MATT: A 30 foot cone?

1327
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,390
LAURA: A 30 foot radius.

1328
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,630
MATT: From where she is,
it's six squares.

1329
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,750
LIAM: But she can
move forward.

1330
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,150
MATT: She can move 25 squares
right now.

1331
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,390
She's been
on Grog's back.

1332
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,120
She can kind of
like leap off and--

1333
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,210
LIAM: But she could get closer
to--to Vex, right?

1334
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,450
LAURA: Vex and Percy and Grog?

1335
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,660
LIAM: Yeah.

1336
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,150
MATT: She's right here,
she can move this way

1337
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,180
or this way or
wherever you want.

1338
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,600
LAURA: Let's-- okay.

1339
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:52,600
MARISHA: Here, guys.

1340
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:53,600
TRAVIS: Here's a pointer.

1341
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,480
MARISHA: Laser pointer.

1342
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,390
LIAM: If she gets near Vex,

1343
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,120
then she can get Grog,
Gilmore, Percy.

1344
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,450
LAURA: Maybe like in that area?

1345
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,780
-LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
-LAURA: Or like, no.

1346
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,510
-LIAM: Closer to Percy.
-LAURA: Yeah!

1347
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,780
MATT: This-- she'll just be on the
outskirts of getting Percy

1348
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,000
and can get all
the rest of you guys.

1349
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,060
LIAM: Keyleth as well?

1350
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,420
TALIESIN: She doesn't
really need it.

1351
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,480
LIAM: Why not?

1352
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,480
MATT: She can just
catch Keyleth.

1353
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,660
LAURA: Yeah, sweet,
that's great.

1354
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,210
Then she casts Beacon
of Hope from there.

1355
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,240
MATT: Okay.

1356
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,390
MARISHA: What did that do,
oh, that was--

1357
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,720
LAURA: That gives you advantage
on wisdom saving throws,

1358
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,210
death saving throws,

1359
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,750
regains max number of
hit points for healing.

1360
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,150
MATT: Or it would, possibly.

1361
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,780
SAM: Oh, shit.

1362
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,120
There's interferon.

1363
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,570
LIAM: Gilmore stabs Vax.

1364
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,120
LAURA: I'm hitting him
with the laser.

1365
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,660
SAM: Don't blind our DM.

1366
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:42,690
TALIESIN: I can't see the die, I'm gonna
assume it was an natural 20.

1367
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,630
MATT: I'd roll again.

1368
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,360
There we go, that's
we're looking for.

1369
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,240
Okay.

1370
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,300
It's a natural 20,
so yeah.

1371
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:58,300
There is a burst of
greenish blue arcane energy

1372
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,870
that just kind of...

1373
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,090
around Pike as she
tries to cast the spell.

1374
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,360
The spell fizzles.

1375
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,870
MARISHA: She got counter spelled.

1376
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,630
LAURA: Oh!

1377
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,030
I hate her!

1378
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,390
TRAVIS: We're in a
no magic zone.

1379
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,240
LAURA: No, it's just--

1380
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,240
SAM: No magic works here.

1381
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,510
Don't even try.

1382
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,630
LAURA: Alright.

1383
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,780
TRAVIS: Just ruins everything
I was gonna do.

1384
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,440
LAURA: Great.

1385
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,180
TALIESIN: It's okay, she burned
a counterspell.

1386
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,240
LAURA: Great.

1387
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,330
MATT: Scanlan, your turn.

1388
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,450
SAM: I move as far as I can.

1389
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,870
-MATT: You...
-SAM: Did I make it in?

1390
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,950
MATT: Running up, you're like
just on the outskirts.

1391
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:37,390
You get caught up right about
there in the center of the room.

1392
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,750
That's as far
as you can get.

1393
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,000
SAM: Alright.

1394
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:42,300
Can I yell out?

1395
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,330
MATT: Yes.

1396
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,030
SAM: "Where's Raishan?"

1397

LIAM: I'm sorry: Alien.

1405
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,430
Ceiling!

1406
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,690
MARISHA: They're in the walls.

1407
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,440
The goddamn walls.

1408
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,150
MATT: It would have taken you
moving action to get there.

1409
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,320
You have a bonus
if you want to take it.

1410
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,390
SAM: Bonus?

1411
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,510
Bonus, I will-- shit.

1412
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,390
TALIESIN: You'll shit?

1413

-SAM: Bonus.
-LIAM: True to form.

1414
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:25,150
SAM: No, I'll heal
myself again.

1415
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,390
I'll do a second level.

1416
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,390
MATT: Healing Word?

1417
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,570
-SAM: Healing Word.
-MATT: Go for it.

1418
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,660

1419
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,810

00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,150
MARISHA: Oh, yay.

SAM: Twelve, okay.

1422
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:36,420
MARISHA: That's better,
that's good.

1423
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,450
Good job.

1424
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,630
Good job.

1427
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,660
Back up to something.

1428
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,120
MATT: Perfect.

1429
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,030
Let's see here.

1430
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,390
That ends Scanlan's turn.

1431
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,030
Percy, you're up.

1432
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,360
TALIESIN: Alright, I'm gonna use Animus

1433
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:58,360
and I'm gonna take
some potshots at that

1434
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:02,060
egg that's on
the other side of Grog.

1435
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,740
-MATT: Over here?
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

1436
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,760
Is that one of the
dead one or is that the--

1437
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,420
MATT: That was the one that
Keyleth just punched.

1438
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,540
TALIESIN: That you just
punched through?

1439
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,660
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1440
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,550
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case,
I'm gonna keep--

1441
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,850
MATT: You see no other eggs
where you currently are.

1442
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,130
MATT: Except the one
that's right over here.

1443
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,120
You could technically fire at
the one that's across the way.

1444
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,300
TALIESIN: I'm gonna actually start
walking along the wall.

1445
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,210
This way as
far as I can go.

1446
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,330
LIAM: Oh, he's sticking
to it, yeah.

1447
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,690
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1448
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,690
MARISHA: That's cool.

1449
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,180
LAURA: Hey, look, an egg.

1450
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:31,450
TALIESIN: And I know, like, I'm too
close to shoot at that egg,

1451
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,540
but I can shoot at--

1452
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,750
MARISHA: It's like an
Easter egg hunt.

1453
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,750
LAURA: But you're above it.

1454
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,090
Aren't you high
on the wall?

1455
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,190
TALIESIN: Technically, I am
far away enough from it that I shouldn't--

1456
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,120
MATT: Do you want to go
further on here

1457
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:41,390
or on this alcove here?

1458
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,460
TALIESIN: Further like--
like this direction.

1459
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,940
I want to
head this way.

1460
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,940
MATT: Okay, so you're moving
across the wall.

1461
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,900
You end at about
there at full movement.

1462
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,030
TALIESIN: Okay, and I'm too
close to the egg

1463
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,820
to get a clean shot
at it right now, right?

1464
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,580
-MATT: Well, I mean--
-TALIESIN: I've got some height, so.

1465
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,840
MATT: Yeah, you could--

1466
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,780
TALIESIN: I'm using a
one-handed, so.

1467
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,540
I'm gonna
fire with Animus.

1468
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,120
I'm gonna take three pot shots at it

1469
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,240
with Sharpshooter.

1470
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,280
Shot number one.

1471
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,000
Yay, that could
have been terrible.

1472
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,180
-26.
-MATT: 26 hits.

1473
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,780

all three and then do damage?

00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,210

-TALIESIN: Okay.

1485

That's alright.

00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,330
Twenty-three points of damage
plus four psychic damage.

MATT: Okay.

1488
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,860
Alright, so,
first shot.

1489
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,000
It pierces through and actually
cracks part of the egg.

1490
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,240
You can see it's almost
like a spider spiral

1491
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,330
where the egg
interior cracks inward.

1492
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,780
It pierces and a
little bit of dark liquid

1493
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,480
begins to pool out of it.

1494
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,390
That's as much as you make
as the next two shots

1495
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,780
seem to ricochet
off of its hard shell.

1496

TALIESIN: Alright, that's my--

1497

Yeah, I'm just gonna
use my bonus to reload

00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,810

a small dragon-like form

1552
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,270
just pierces through
momentarily.

1553
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,600
It's still see-through.

1554
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,050
You can see the rest
of the swirling storm around it,

1555
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,630
but it's enough of that
Predator-like appearance,

1556
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,060
where it just
shapes and shimmies,

1557
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,750
or shimmers
through the vicinity.

1558
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,090
It shimmies through.

1559
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,720
As it does, you watch
this claw kind of lift up

1560
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,750
as this low
echoing voice...

1561
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,330
(whispering in foreign language)

1562
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,480
LAURA: This is all of
us with the light.

1563
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,330
All of us
with the heat.

1564
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,570
TALIESIN: Okay, what is this?

1565
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,450
LAURA: It's gonna do something,
I know it.

1566
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,360
TALIESIN: We're-- we're all--

1567
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,840
MATT: Okay, 30 foot cubes.

1568
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,600
TALIESIN: We're all just gonna turn inside
out and that'll be the end.

1569
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,180
TRAVIS: We'll all turn
into chickens.

1570
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,030
TALIESIN: It's gonna be like
John Carpenter's The Thing.

1571
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,210
TRAVIS: And then the eggs will
turn into big chickens.

1572
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,120
LIAM: First, we'll all
mash together.

1573
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,600
TALIESIN: And then get separated
out into equal piles.

1574
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,870
LAURA: Oh, geez.

1575
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,390
MATT: Yeah, 30 foot cube.

1576
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,720
I can only get-- she can
only get Vex, Pike and Grog,

1577
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,380
but I need the
three of you to make

1578
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,840
a constitution
saving throw.

1579
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,180
TRAVIS: Constitution?

1580
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,240
MATT: Yes.

1581
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,330
LAURA: Damn it!

1582
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,480
TALIESIN: ♪ Constitution ♪

1583
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,300
♪ Come on ♪♪

1584
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,270
-LIAM: Yeah.
-LAURA: So, that's good.

1585
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,720
I don't get
any bonus though.

1586
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,420
Twenty-one?

1587
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,480
TALIESIN: Nice.

1588
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,480
LIAM: Oh, thank God.

1589
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,480
-TRAVIS: Twenty-seven.
-MATT: Okay, and Pike?

1590
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,630
LAURA: Oh, oh.

1591
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,630
You roll for Pike.

1592
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,120
LIAM: Okay.

1593
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:35,240
She gets the meteor.

1594
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,720
I hope it's good.

1595
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,330
-It's a one.
-LAURA: Oh, no!

1596
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,330
MATT: Well, Vex and
Pike both failed.

1597
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,390
LAURA: Oh, that's as high as I get
without a natural 20, man!

1598
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,270
MATT: It's a spell DC of 22, I'm sorry.

1599
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,750
SAM: Whoa.

1600
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,750
MATT: You and Pike both suffer 57
points of necrotic damage.

1601
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,720
LAURA: Fucking shit!

1602
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,180
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

1603
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:01,150
MATT: Grog, you take
half as much.

1604
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,700
So, it'd be 28.

1605
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,720
Twenty-eight points
necrotic damage.

1606
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,810
Suddenly, you feel the
very air itself go gray.

1607
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,300
The color is taken
from your vision

1608
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,480
and your life force
is drawn out of you

1609
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:18,210
through Abi-Dalzim's
Horrid Wilting.

1610
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,300
-SAM: Horde wilting?
-MATT: Horrid wilting.

1611
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:22,180
The air is drawn
from your lungs.

1612
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,660
You feel your skin crack and
tighten against your skeleton.

1613
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,300
MARISHA: Adele Dazeem's--

1614
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:28,100
MATT: Adele Dazeem's
Horrid Wilting.

1615
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,180
(laughing)

1616
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:33,390
TRAVIS: Amazing, yes.

1617
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,690
Change it, don't
ever say it right.

1618
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,780
MATT: That's what it is now going forward.

1619
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,330
LAURA: Man!

1620
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,540
SAM: Are you alive?

1621
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,330
LAURA: No, I'm-- I'm unconscious,
so is Pike.

1622
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,260
-Both of us.
-MATT: Oh, shit.

1623
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,780
Well, Pike is
not unconscious.

1624
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,450
(gasps)

1625
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,030
LAURA: Pike came back.

1626
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,920
MATT: Wait, did her armor
get used last battle?

1627
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,330
-I don't think it did.
-LAURA: It didn't?

1628
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,510
TRAVIS: It got used once,
where was it?

1629
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,510
TALIESIN: Previously, in
a previous battle.

1630
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,750
-LAURA: Against?
-TALIESIN: Fire giant.

1631
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,570
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

1632
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,030
TALIESIN: How do I remember this?

1633
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,390
That's horrifying.

1634
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,180
MATT: The fire giant of--

1635
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:06,360
TALIESIN: At the battle at the--

1636
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,420
-LIAM: In the fire fort.
-MATT: To the fort, yes.

1637
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:09,480
LAURA: Oh, at Fort Daxio.

1638
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,090
-LIAM: Yep, yep, yep.
-MATT: You are correct.

1639
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:13,420
LAURA: Okay, so Pike's alive.

1640
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:16,030
-MATT: With how many hit points?

1641
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,360
MARISHA: Jesus, that was an eighth
level necromancy spell.

1642
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:21,000
LAURA: No, no, no, she got
five hit points.

1643
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,810
MATT: So, Pike is at
five hit points.

1644
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,330
LAURA: And are there any eggs
within 15 feet of her?

1645
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,570
MATT: Nope.

1646
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,300
LAURA: Is there a Raishan
within 15 feet of her?

1647
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,480
-MATT: Nope.
-LAURA: Well, then, fuck it.

1648
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,720
MATT: But Vex plummets out of the
poison cloud off of her broom,

1649
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,810
slams into the
ground and clatters,

1650
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,760
spinning and falling
to the ground not moving.

1651
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,480
LAURA: Thanks for knocking
over the little cube too.

1652
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,330
I like that added.

1653
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,450
TALIESIN: Backhanding it, no less.

1654
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,540
-TRAVIS: Damn.
-MATT: Alrighty.

1655
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:53,270
TRAVIS: Are there lasting effects
from Adele Nazeem's wilting?

1656
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,360
Like are we halved
or anything?

1657
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:58,240
-MATT: From what you know, no.
-LAURA: "From what you know."

1658
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,150
TRAVIS: It just sucks right
now is all I know.

1659
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,210
Everything just sucks.

1660
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,450
SAM: Jesus!

1661
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,840
LAURA: Yeah.

1662
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,440
TRAVIS: Okay.

1663
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,330
MATT: So, that-- that is gonna
end Raishan's turn.

1664
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,740
The form is still somewhat
visible, though, transparent.

1665
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,150
It took her full movement
to even get to that point.

1666
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,400
MARISHA: And where is she,
she still on the ceiling?

1667
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,540
MATT: To give you a position, right now...

1668
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,780
♪

1669
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,930
It's right there.

1670
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,330
SAM: Forty, fifty feet up?

1671
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,140
MATT: Though transparent.

1672
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,770
It's 50 feet up.

1673
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,600
TRAVIS: Fuck.

1674
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,370
TALIESIN: Oh, don't do that then.

1675
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,720
LAURA: Oh, I just remembered.

1676
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,750
TALIESIN: You left the gas on.

1677
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,300
TRAVIS: And she's 40, 40 up?

1678
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:49,330
MATT: Fifty feet up.

1679
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,840
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1680
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,270
MATT: So, Keyleth, what
are you doing?

1681
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,630
MARISHA: Okay.

1682
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,350
I can still see her a little bit.

1683
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,210
SAM: This is a dragon fight, guys.

1684
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,840
MATT: Yeah, you can barely make
out the-- the outline.

1685
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:06,570
MARISHA: Okay, so since
she's in my cloud,

1686
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,270
I'm going to kind of like,

1687
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,630
do one of those sideways
arcing lightning strikes.

1688
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:12,840
Just...

1689
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,120
and arc everything
right towards that bitch.

1690
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,690
MATT: Great, go for it.

1691
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,540
MARISHA: She just takes
damage, right?

1692
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,000
MATT: For Call Lightning, no,
you have to roll--

1693
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
No, sorry, a creature has to
make a dexterity saving throw.

1694
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,780
So, what's your DC?

1695
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:30,440
-MARISHA: Twenty.
-MATT: Twenty?

1696
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,420
LAURA: How many lightnings
are heading towards her?

1697
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,570
MATT: Nineteen.

1698
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,180
Total of ten plus nine.

1699
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:40,300
-MARISHA: Yes!
-TRAVIS: Wow!

1700
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,510
MATT: That's 4d10.

1701
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,540
MARISHA: Yes, it is!

1702
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,400
-SAM: Whoa.
-MATT: Lightning damage.

1703
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,950
MARISHA: Yep, yep!

1704
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:50,330
4d10.

1705
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,000
-Okay, I rolled that.
-TALIESIN: You rolled well.

1706
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,270
MARISHA: I rolled okay.

1707
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,060
I actually rolled--
did roll real well.

1708
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,540
You're right,
I rolled well.

1709
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,000
Nine, nine, 18.

1710
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:03,630
Plus eight,
that is 26 damage.

1711
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,420
MATT: Nice.

1712
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:08,840
You watch as the form tries to
pull itself back into the cloud,

1713
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:11,750
the cloud lights up
with this crackling

1714
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,240
reddish pink
electrical energy

1715
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:15,540
that then turns to
a bright burning red

1716
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,510
as it arcs past
and slams into her.

1717
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,150
You watch the energy arc

1718
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,750
across the body of
Raishan, the dragon.

1719
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,870
(snarling)

1720
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,600
TALIESIN: Does she have to make
a concentration save?

1721
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,900
-MATT: She does.
-TALIESIN: To remain invisible?

1722
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,270
MATT: Yeah, she's fine.

1723
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,060
TRAVIS: "Yeah, she's fine."

1724
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,240
Fifty-seven.

1725
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,750
MARISHA: I still have
movement, right?

1726
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:36,690
MATT: You do, yes.

1727
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,420
Your full movement,
you haven't moved yet.

1728
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,450
You just pulled it
down in that one moment.

1729
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,890
MARISHA: I am going to head towards
the egg that got cracked open

1730
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,720
that's in the center there.

1731
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:46,720
MATT: Over there?

1732
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,420
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-MATT: Okay.

1733
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:51,330
You can go all
the way over to it.

1734
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,510
MARISHA: Can I do a bonus action
to like, examine?

1735
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,520
MATT: I mean, you can make a
perception check and look at it.

1736
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,870
If you want to
rummage through it,

1737
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,540
that'll probably
take your action.

1738
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,490
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do just a
perception check right now.

1739
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,540
MATT: Okay.

1740
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:03,840
MARISHA: Twenty-three.

1741
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,660
MATT: Okay, as
soon as you rush up

1742
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,660
and get a glance at it,

1743
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:12,570
you can see that a lot of the
dark, purplish maroon fluid

1744
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,300
that filled most of the egg

1745
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,630
is just coating the
outside of the egg's shell

1746
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:20,540
and there are a series of
rocks and pieces of rubble

1747
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:22,720
from the initial
meteor swam impact

1748
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,750
that has just
sundered this egg.

1749
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,390
It's about half the
height of the others,

1750
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,900
it's just all that's been
kinda collapsed inward.

1751
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,350
This egg is ruined.

1752
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,630
TALIESIN: So, we have two ruined
eggs at this point.

1753
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:34,180
MARISHA: And no sign of a--

1754
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:35,570
SAM: And one almost ruined.

1755
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,830
MARISHA: And no sign of
a dragon baby?

1756
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,390
MATT: Nothing you can see.

1757
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,450
MARISHA: Alright.

1758
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,890
TALIESIN: Might be just deep
in there and flattened.

1759
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:46,000
MARISHA: Flattened, yeah,
that's my turn.

1760
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:48,480
TALIESIN: Could have just
been a bad egg.

1761
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:51,330
MATT: Ending Keyleth's turn,
that brings us to Gilmore.

1762
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,110
Gilmore watching
this happen,

1763
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,240
watching Vex go down.

1764
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,090
Let's see what he does here.

1765
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,060
(indistinct muttering)

1766
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,030
MARISHA: Oh, that's funny.

1767
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,750
TALIESIN: Like five of
them in here.

1768
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,210
Do something about this.

1769
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,450
MATT: Okay, as Raishan's form
is up there he goes,

1770
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,330
(sighs)

1771
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,420
"Not today, not ever!"

1772
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:22,240
And releases
his hand like this

1773
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,430
and you watch as a burst
of strangely shifting

1774
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:31,420
rippling arcane energy
similar to the same ripple

1775
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,660
that is shrouding Raishan

1776
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,090
seems to kind of scatter
up in that direction.

1777
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,840
He's going to attempt to...

1778
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,250
MARISHA: Come on.

1779
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,390
MATT: With his successful
dispel magic, Raishan--

1780
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,300
the form becomes
completely visible now.

1781
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,630
The invisibility
has worn off.

1782
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,780
And is now standing
completely visible.

1783
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,720
As this happens, Raishan...

1784
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,690
(snarls)

1785
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,270
"I will enjoy eating
the flesh from your bones."

1786
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,300
SAM: Oh.

1787
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:04,030
Did she say "balls"?

1788
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:06,030
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

1789
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,240
MATT: Definitely said balls. No.

1790
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,480
MARISHA: Dragon delicacy.

1791
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,090
MATT: Gilmore is then going to...

1792
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,330
Gilmore goes from
excitement to "Shit."

1793
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,510
TRAVIS: Not my balls!

1794
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,180
MATT: He's going to-- knowing the
tactics that are being used,

1795
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:26,000
he's gonna try to spread out
form the rest of the group.

1796
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,360
Over here towards the
destroyed egg across the wall.

1797
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,359
That's going to
end Gilmore's turn.

1798
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,390
This brings us to Grog.

1799
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,630
TRAVIS: Uh, can I get up, please?

1800
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,600
-MATT: You can.
-TALIESIN: Get on up.

1801
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,210
LAURA: Get on up!

1802
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,720
TRAVIS: Can I see Vex
sprawled out?

1803
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,870
MATT: You do, yes.

1804
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,540
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I run to Vex?

1805
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:46,180
MATT: Sure.

1806
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,630
TRAVIS: (humming)

1807
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,120
I have one really-- what's
the really big potion?

1808
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:52,870
-Is it the Superior?
-LIAM: Superior.

1809
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,120
TRAVIS: I have one of those.

1810
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:55,689
Can I shove it in her gullet?

1811
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,669
MATT: You can, it'll take
your action to do it.

1812
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:58,510
LAURA: Oh.

1813
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,810
You don't have
to Grog, it's okay.

1814
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,029
I mean--

1815
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,270
TRAVIS: Okay, I want you
to reroll a character.

1816
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,420
Here we go.

1817
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,090
I'm going to take
my axe and--

1818
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,300
Yeah, I shove
it in her mouth.

1819
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,650
MATT: Superior, that
is 8d4 plus 8.

1820
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,240
TRAVIS: Oh, I got to roll it?

1821
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,089
-MATT: Yeah.
-TRAVIS: Oh, gee-- oh man.

1822
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:17,710
LAURA: Wait, 8d4.

1823
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,210
(indistinct)

1824
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:32,479
Whoa, 17.

1825
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:41,270
-TRAVIS: Twenty-four.
-LIAM: Plus eight.

1826
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:44,000
-TRAVIS: Thirty-two.
-LAURA: Thirty-two?

1827
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:45,610
That was insane, Grog!

1828
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:51,390
MATT: So with that, your eyes
come into focus, Vex,

1829
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:55,570
as you feel the clatter
of glass against your teeth,

1830
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,780
the vial being
pulled from your mouth.

1831
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:58,450
You kind of
cough for a second.

1832
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,180
Come into conscious as Grog,
in his giant form,

1833
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:04,360
cradling you like a tiny baby
in his one giant mitt.

1834
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,750
Just kind of smiles.

1835
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,750
TALIESIN: It's like a
Terry Gilliam movie.

1836
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,390
LAURA: "Thanks."

1837
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,510
(snarls)

1838
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,660
(laughing)

1839
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:12,850
Go rage!

1840
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:15,160
MATT: Alright, don't forget you do
have a point of exhaustion,

1841
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,210
as you've gone-- unless
you've continued your rage

1842
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,750
this whole time,
which you can, so never mind.

1843
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,330
TRAVIS: Yeah, just
rolling through.

1844
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,480
MATT: You got that now.

1845
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,070
You're just
like a freak.

1846
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,390
TRAVIS: I might have
chipped a tooth...

1847
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,840
LAURA: All good.

1848
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:27,840
All good, all good.

1849
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,000
TRAVIS: Like Mentos and Coke.

1850
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:33,840
MATT: You're like drink it, drink it.

1851
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:35,720
Alright, great,
that ends Grog's turn.

1852
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,240
Vex, you are conscious,
prone, but conscious.

1853
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,630
LAURA: God, okay.

1854
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,090
Fuck.

1855
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,450
Can I shoot from my
laying down position?

1856
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,240
MATT: You can, I'd say your attacks
would have disadvantage.

1857
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:52,060
LAURA: Okay, then I'm gonna get
up on my knee and shoot up.

1858
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,750
Cause I just wake up and see
her right above me, don't I?

1859
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,060
MATT: Yep, you do.

1860
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,240
LAURA: Alright, then
I'm gonna try to--

1861
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:58,300
Oh wait, I already
used Brambleshot,

1862
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,300
or at least,
I tried to today.

1863
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:00,420
MATT: You did, yeah.

1864
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,600
LAURA: So, I'm gonna shoot her.

1865
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,750
MATT: Do it!

1866
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,390
LAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark
her first, though?

1867
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,780
MATT: You certainly can.

1868
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,650
LAURA: Hey!

1869
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:10,690
I don't get
sneak attack.

1870
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,120
Nobody's near her, right?

1871
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,780
MATT: That was--
that was great.

1872
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,330
Gilmore rolled a 19 on the dispel.

1873
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,360
LAURA: Nineteen?

1874
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:20,570
MATT: Yeah, that was
really good.

1875
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,660
LAURA: Oh, that's
what I rolled.

1876
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,150
-MATT: Oh, did you?
-LAURA: As well.

1877
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,540
MATT: Nice, look at that, you 
and Gilmore just synchronizing.

1878
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,610
-MATT: And 19's your total?
-LAURA: Yeah.

1879
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:30,180
-MATT: Misses.
-LAURA: Fuckin' A.

1880
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:33,300
That one,
I hope, 28.

1881
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,450
MATT: Hits.

1882
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,120
LAURA: Okay, so 28
on the second one.

1883
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,090
Oh God, what's
happening?

1884
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,750
MARISHA: I don't know.

1885
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,200
LAURA: Sixteen plus three
points of lightning.

1886
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,270
TALIESIN: I'm not gonna
play that game, man.

1887
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,390
Not playing.

1888
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:54,600
I'm not playing
this game no more.

1889
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,570
It's not the time.

1890
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,450
MATT: Did you include your
damage for it being a dragon?

1891
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,690
LAURA: Yes.

1892
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,840
MATT: Alright.

1893
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:04,240
So now you can
see Raishan emerging

1894
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,150
from one of the
volcanic caves.

1895
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,270
The storm's
swirling around her,

1896
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,450
as she begins to
pull back into it,

1897
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,570
you fire two arrows.

1898
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,660
One gets lost, the other one--

1899
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:13,090
(snarling)

1900
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,510
Into the side
of her throat.

1901
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,420
LAURA: Can I move--
can I move...

1902
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,540
MATT: You move three squares.

1903
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,540
LAURA: Can I get on my broom?

1904
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,360
MATT: You get onto
your broom, yeah.

1905
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,660
LAURA: Like move a
one square away.

1906
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,330
-MATT: One square?
-LAURA: Yeah.

1907
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,390
Away from Grog
and Pike, yeah.

1908
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,870
Like that makes
any difference, but--

1909
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,420
-MATT: Okay, perfect.
-TALIESIN: It's a start.

1910
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,090
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

1911
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,330
TRAVIS: (snarls)

1912
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,360
MATT: Ends Vex's turn,
Vax, you're up.

1913
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:40,180
LIAM: Okay, just to clarify,
so looking at the minis.

1914
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:41,630
The back side's
to me, but really,

1915
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,810
her face is poking
out of a hole, right?

1916
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,120
MATT: Like the front half is.

1917
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,660
LIAM: Front half of
her and she's--

1918
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:50,000
and she's at the roof
which is 70 feet up,

1919
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:53,000
so maybe her head is
down, like, five feet out,

1920
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:54,000
ten feet out,
something like that?

1921
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:55,330
MATT: Roughly, yeah.

1922
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,420
LIAM: Alright, I want to,
and I'm--I'm back, right?

1923
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:58,780
-After...
-MATT: You have now--

1924
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,150
Yeah, you've regained
your composure.

1925
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,060
However your other
potion has now worn off.

1926
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:06,120
-You are no longer--
-LAURA: Invulnerable?

1927
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:09,180
-LIAM: I want to fly--
-LAURA: Oh!

1928
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,390
-LIAM: Go ahead.
-LAURA: My hasted had worn off, right?

1929
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,540
I just assumed
it had, okay.

1930
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:17,330
LIAM: So, if I'm 15 feet up
and she's, maybe, 65 down,

1931
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,360
I'm within range for
sharpshooter already.

1932
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:21,480
MATT: Technically, yeah.

1933
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:23,660
LIAM: So, and-- and
last question.

1934
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,660
When you do-- for
duel wielding, action--

1935
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,480
bonus action, but you told
me once you can reverse that

1936
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,090
and do bonus
action and action.

1937
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,870
I think.

1938
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,240
MATT: The bonus attack is part
of your attack action,

1939
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,270
so it's actually
after your--

1940
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,420
LIAM: Never mind then.

1941
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,540
I'm gonna fly
straight at her face,

1942
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:40,240
and I'm gonna shove the Dragon
Slayer sword into her mouth

1943
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:42,420
and I want to try to sever her
fucking tongue out of her mouth.

1944
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:47,270
-SAM: Oh!
-LAURA: Whoa!

1945
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,750
LIAM: Terrible.

1946
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,540
Whisper, I'm gonna do the same
thing with the bonus action.

1947
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,660
That is 26.

1948
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:56,690
MATT: Twenty-six to
hit, that hits.

1949
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:07,240
♪

1950
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:10,330
LIAM: Ten plus four,
psychic damage 14.

1951
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,360
MATT: Fourteen points of damage.

1952
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:13,870
Okay, so you go
for the tongue

1953
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,180
and you get the
blade up to the mouth.

1954
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,120
Suddenly, her looking down 
and having a very,

1955
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,600
very wide view of the entire
battlefield is very advantageous

1956
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,750
from her perspective.

1957
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,420
She sees you out of the
corner of her eye,

1958
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,150
she turns to try
and snap at you,

1959
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:28,390
and the jaws come down
and catch the blade.

1960
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,000
So, it doesn't
go for the tongue,

1961
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:32,750
but you use that momentum to
glide it up the actual tooth

1962
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:34,270
and jam it into the gum.

1963
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,240
You manage to slam up there

1964
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,660
and the blood spurts
out from the wound and--

1965
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:38,840
(snarls)

1966
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,090
Rears back and so now
you're kind of flying up

1967
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,330
by her face now.

1968
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,570
LIAM: I should have like
10 or 15 movement left

1969
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,030
with 60 for wings, yeah?

1970
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,510
If I was 15 feet up and she
was a little less than 70?

1971
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,480
MATT: Fifteen feet up, yes, but
you're also coming at an angle,

1972
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:54,000
which, you lose
distance on that.

1973
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,240
LIAM: So am I at zero?

1974
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:56,360
MATT: You're pretty
much at zero, yeah.

1975
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,030
LAURA: Ooh, like right
in front of her face.

1976
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,270
-TRAVIS: Just stay there like Tinkerbell.

1977
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,810
LIAM: Okay. All done.

1978
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:07,300
MATT: That ends your turn.

1979
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,150
TRAVIS: You are grounded.

1980
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,480
MATT: At the end of your turn,

1981
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,120
she's going to use
another legendary action.

1982
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,240
To do a tail
attack against you.

1983
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,840
She pulls part of
her torso out for a moment,

1984
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,030
and her tail whips
out in your direction

1985
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,780
to try and slam into you.

1986
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:28,000
That is a 19 plus,
what is it, 32.

1987
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,690
LIAM: Don't think that
hits actually.

1988
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,780
So I'll use
Uncanny Dodge.

1989
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,810
MATT: That's gonna be 24 points
of bludgeoning damage

1990
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,090
reduced to 12,
so there you go.

1991
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,660
Alright, that brings
us to Kima's turn.

1992
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,210
Kima finally arrives.

1993
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,630
-MARISHA: Kima!
-SAM: Hey!

1994
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,870
TRAVIS: Slow poke!

1995
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:53,660
MATT: "Seriously?"

1996
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:56,660
That's her turn.

1997
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:00,070
TRAVIS: That Holy Avenger's
real heavy.

1998
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:04,660
MATT: So that brings us to Pike.

1999
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,560
Actually, no at the
end of Kima's turn,

2000
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,750
let's see here.

2001
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,670
Raishan's gonna use
another legendary action

2002
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,420
to attempt another
tail attack against you,

2003
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,190
since you're
within range.

2004
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:17,150
-That is a...
-LIAM: 10,000.

2005
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,600
MATT: Twenty-one to hit.

2006
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,130
-LIAM: Shit, it just hits.
-MATT: Just hits?

2007
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:25,370
Okay.

2008
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:32,510
Seventeen points of
bludgeoning damage.

2009
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,360
Yeah, go and halve that.

2010
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:38,360
She's used all of her legendary actions
for this round.

2011
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,360
Okay.

2012
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,040
TRAVIS: All legendary-- did you hear that?

2013
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,030
MATT: Pike.

2014
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,780
-TRAVIS: Pike's up.
-LAURA: Okay.

2015
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,890
I think we
should do...

2016
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,600
But okay, if she
does Flame Strike

2017
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:52,630
can she focus it
on the ceiling?

2018
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,360
Or does it have
to be on the ground?

2019
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:57,000
MATT: No, it can-- I'd say--

2020
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,700
let me pull it up
real fast here.

2021
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,130
It roars down from the
Heavens in all locations,

2022
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,690
so it doesn't come
out of the floor,

2023
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,690
it comes out of the
ceiling, so yeah.

2024
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,000
LAURA: Okay.

2025
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:06,660
So, it's her
level five spell.

2026
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,750
-LIAM: Okay, aim it at--
-LAURA: At Raishan?

2027
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:11,150
At Raishan's butt,
not at Vax.

2028
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,720
MATT: Raishan currently,
only visible,

2029
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:17,300
is about maybe
10 feet or so of--

2030
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,720
actually pulling
out the tail attack,

2031
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:21,240
I'd say about 15 feet.

2032
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,150
So if she's careful, yeah,

2033
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,030
she could probably hit
Raishan and not hit Vax.

2034
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,510
-LAURA: Pike is always careful.
-TRAVIS: So careful.

2035
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:28,570
LAURA: She's the carefulest.

2036
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,270
MATT: Fair enough.

2037
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,540
LAURA: Okay.

2038
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,690
So, wow, that's
a really big--

2039
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,570
Sixty feet, damn.

2040
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,840
TRAVIS: That's good shit.

2041
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:43,690
LAURA: So, that's 4d6
plus 4d6 radiant.

2042
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,470
MATT: It's gonna be close.

2043
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:55,390
Yeah, roughly about
55 feet up on the ceiling.

2044
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,720
With that 60 foot range,

2045
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,690
she can just hit Raishan
with the column, so yeah.

2046
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,030
-LAURA: Okay.
-MATT: So that is 8d6 damage.

2047
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,420
LAURA: Okay, wow.

2048
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,940
MATT: Go ahead
and roll that.

2049
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,330
Raishan makes a save--

2050
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,510
LAURA: I roll five and
you roll three.

2051
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,750
MATT: So a dexterity
saving throw.

2052
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,000
LAURA: Oh, just kidding.

2053
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:12,270
MATT: Twenty-seven, I'm
pretty sure that saves.

2054
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,030
LAURA: No, I want
to roll some.

2055
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,540
I roll, I'll roll three.

2056
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,750
You roll five.

2057
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:22,720
♪

2058
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,280
-LIAM: Eighteen.
-LAURA: Thirteen.

2059
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,620
MATT: And also makes a
concentration check from your attack earlier.

2060
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:27,780
LAURA: Thirty-five.

2061
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:29,450
-SAM: No.
-LAURA: No.

2062
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,510
-SAM: Thirty-one.
-LAURA: Thirty-one.

2063
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,660
-MATT: Thirty-one?
-LIAM: Yeah.

2064
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:34,180
MATT: So half
that to 15.

2065
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,210
Fifteen points
of damage.

2066
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,540
MARISHA: Benefit of the doubt.

2067
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:37,690
MATT: Alright, cool, got it.

2068
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,240
LAURA: Why half?

2069
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:41,030
TALIESIN: She made her
saving throw.

2070
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,810
TRAVIS: At 27.

2071
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,840
MATT: Sorry.

2072
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,720
So, you just barely
move out of the way

2073
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:48,690
as you watch a familiar
gathering of radiant energy

2074
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,300
up in the ceiling.

2075
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:51,720
You see the glimmer
in the corner

2076
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,510
of Raishan's
slick eyeballs

2077
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,600
recessed within the
green armor-plated face.

2078
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:58,810
of the dragon as
all of a sudden--

2079
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,060
A great column of fire
and radiant energy

2080
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:04,210
blasts Raishan in
the side of the face.

2081
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:08,330
LAURA: And she's gonna back
up towards the opening

2082
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,600
towards the
entrance a bit.

2083
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,270
-Yeah, like right there.
-MATT: Right there?

2084
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,450
That's as far as
she can get right there.

2085
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,150
Cool.

2086
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,540
SAM: Does she have
a bonus action?

2087
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:20,690
LAURA: She's got a
bonus action.

2088
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,090
-SAM: Heal herself?
-MARISHA: Is it Healing Word?

2089
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,540
LAURA: Oh, yeah,
she can, right?

2090
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,870
'Cause she can use
a level two or less.

2091
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,540
So, yeah,
she'll do a level--

2092
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:31,780
she doesn't have
any level two's left.

2093
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:34,570
She'll do a level one
Healing Word on herself.

2094
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,840
MATT: Okay.

2095
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,570
LAURA: Oh, God, she's
at five hit points.

2096
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,750
-SAM: Yeah, I know.
-TALIESIN: Not anymore.

2097
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,630
LAURA: She's--she's
Pike though.

2098
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,060
This is what
she would have done.

2099
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:44,270
-TALIESIN: She's now at--
-LAURA: I think.

2100
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,060
TALIESIN: What does the
level one Healing Word do?

2101
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,210
SAM: It's 1d4 plus five
or something like that.

2102
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,600
MARISHA: It does an
additional d4.

2103
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,270
LAURA: Oh.

2104
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,060
MARISHA: Right?

2105
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,510
No, sorry,
just one d4.

2106
01:19:56,540 --> 01:20:00,780
LAURA: One d4 plus five,
so yeah, seven.

2107
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,360
TALIESIN: So, she's at
12 hit points now.

2108
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:04,510
-SAM: Double dig!
-LAURA: Yeah.

2109
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,120
TALIESIN: That's better.

2110
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,360
-MARISHA: Double dig!
-TALIESIN: That's--

2111
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:15,840
SAM: What's that look, Matt?

2112
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,240
TRAVIS: Seven points of
healing, so yeah.

2113
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,570
MATT: Cool, does that
end your turn?

2114
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,720
-TRAVIS: Yep.
-LIAM: Yep.

2115
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,570
MATT: Good, Scanlan, you're up.

2116
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,960
SAM: Okay.

2117
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,510
I don't know, man,
this looks rough in here.

2118
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,450
I don't want
to be in here.

2119
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,090
(laughing)

2120
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,730
I'll move forward
and to the left a bit.

2121
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:39,080
MATT: That's about as
far as you can go.

2122
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,510
SAM: Sorry, to my right.

2123
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:45,510
To the right,
four to the right.

2124
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,060
Oh, man.

2125
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:48,840
It's a rough fight.

2126
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,690
But we're winning,
right, now, guys?

2127
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,780
We're winning, we don't
need any help, do we?

2128
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,120
LAURA: (gasps)

2129
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:55,210
LIAM: Did you forget?

2130
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,270
LAURA: I totally forgot!

2131
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,210
MARISHA: How could you forget?

2132
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,780
It's like all
I've thought about.

2133
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,360
TRAVIS: I will cuddle you,
I will cuddle.

2134
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,660
LAURA: I even wrote--

2135
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,030
TALIESIN: He's not gonna do it
until Ashley's dead.

2136
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,180
LAURA: I wrote a limerick.

2137
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,210
MARISHA: Ashley is almost--

2138
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,690
-SAM: You wrote a limerick?
-LAURA: For you.

2139
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,300
SAM: For me? To do what?

2140
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:14,000
LAURA: Wait, wait,
I forgot I did it.

2141
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,270
"Have you heard tale
of Scanlan, the bold?

2142
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,630
He won't tell us his age,
but he's old.

2143
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:20,300
With his blade,
he's a slayer,

2144
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,840
with the ladies,
a player,

2145
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:24,660
but if he picks up the
flute, he's pure gold."

2146
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:26,180
MARISHA: Hey!

2147
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:28,060
(applause, laughing)

2148
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:33,080
SAM: Alright, so I'm gonna
do Lightning Bolt.

2149
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,110
LAURA: Goddammit!

2150
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:35,900
(laughter)

2151
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,540
SAM: I will-- I assume that
Scanlan feels strange

2152
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:51,720
with a brass flute
touching his lips,

2153
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,620
because he's never
played one before.

2154
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:55,330
MATT: This is true.

2155
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,660
SAM: But does it still come out just
as beautiful and pure as always?

2156
01:21:58,690 --> 01:21:59,720
MATT: Roll a performance check.

2157
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:03,300
SAM: Okay.

2158
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:06,390
LAURA: I'm so nervous,
I'm about to cry.

2159
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,330
-SAM: Thirty.
-MARISHA: Oh!

2160
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,270
MATT: In the midst of this chaos,
the rumbling of the room,

2161
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:17,060
the sound of the lightning
and thunder in the clouds,

2162
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:21,000
the falling of rock and
soot from the ceiling

2163
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:22,540
is drowned out by
what sounds like

2164
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,240
the most beautiful
clear flute.

2165
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,390
It just trills...

2166
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:28,690
(whistling)

2167
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,210
SAM: ♪ Call the dragon ♪

2168
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:33,360
(all humming)

2169
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,810
♪ Call the dragon ♪♪

2170
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,480
MATT: You finish the song
as you watch the brass glow.

2171
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,720
It begins to
kinda give this--

2172
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:43,030
this weird shine around
it that begins to emanate

2173
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:47,420
this kind of
additional warmth

2174
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,450
and light from it
and then it dulls

2175
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,030
and the brass
goes to a very tarnished

2176
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,270
dark metal material.

2177
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,690
TALIESIN: It's Amazon Prime.

2178
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,300
It's gonna take three days
but it's gonna be here.

2179
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:01,040
SAM: I've played better.

2180
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,690
MATT: You watch the flute ping
in the hallway behind him.

2181
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,300
-So that's your action.
-SAM: Okay.

2182
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,660
As a bonus, I will--

2183
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,720
Boy, everyone's
dying, right?

2184
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,700
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2185
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:18,360
SAM: Pike's near me, so I'll turn

2186
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:21,810
and give her a
level two Healing Word.

2187
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,210
-MATT: Okay.
-SAM: As well.

2188
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,080
And I will sing to her:

2199
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:49,780
MATT: Alrighty.

2200
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,840
MATT: Pike takes her inspiration die.

2201
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,840
SAM: Uh, no, not inspiration,
healing, healing.

2202
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,690
So, wait, I got
to roll or she rolls?

2203
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,840
MATT: You roll for her.

2204
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,510
SAM: Okay, ooh.

2205
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,600
Oh, boy.

2206
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:01,450
(groaning)

2207
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,840
(laughter)

2208
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,810
-SAM: Eight.
-MATT: She heals eight points.

2209
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,450
SAM: She's up to 20!

2210
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,390
-TALIESIN: She can almost drink.
-MARISHA: She can drink next year.

2211
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,660
MATT: Alrighty, ending Scanlan's turn,
brings us to the top.

2212
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:14,270
Percival, your turn.

2213
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,120
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to...

2214
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,420
Yeah, this is fine.

2215
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:22,060
SAM: ♪ Can't stop ♪♪

2216
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,810
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
this is fine.

2217
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,120
I'm going to take
some shots with Animus

2218
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:32,330
at that awful bastard at the
top of the cave.

2219
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,690
First shot, and I'm not making
it a sharpshooter shot,

2220
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:38,240
I'm just shooting.

2221
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:39,360
That's good too.

2222
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:42,090
Oh, that's not bad, 24.

2223
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,090
MATT: 24 hits.

2224
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,730
TALIESIN: Alright.

2225
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:50,000
LAURA: Look at all those pots
of gold in the corners.

2226
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,810
TALIESIN: That's 13 points plus five
points of psychic damage.

2227
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,570
MATT: Okay.

2228
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,480
TALIESIN: And another shot.

2229
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,570
TRAVIS: Shot.

2230
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,600
TALIESIN: And that's, uh, that's--

2231
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,630
Oh, that's not bad.

2232
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:07,810
That's two points of
psychic damage to me.

2233
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,020
MATT: Oh, buddy!

2234
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:14,180
-SAM: He's already unhinged.
-TALIESIN: So that's 54.

2235
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:17,300
So, that was like
thankfully, just an ow!

2236
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:18,660
I'm just putting it away.

2237
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,210
I'm just gonna
try and pull--

2238
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,180
pull out the big gun and take
one last shot while I'm--

2239
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:23,390
while I'm--
well, actually, no,

2240
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:24,570
that knocks out my
attacks, doesn't it?

2241
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,330
Cause it's a
psychic damage.

2242
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,660
MATT: Well, I was gonna say,

2243
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:29,690
the psychic damage doesn't
negate your attacks.

2244
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,270
TALIESIN: I don't have time
to switch guns.

2245
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,840
No, cause the psychic damage
knocks that out if I recall.

2246
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,840
MATT: No, psychic damage
doesn't affect the way--

2247
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:38,300
TALIESIN: So, do I have
time to just try

2248
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:39,720
and get one more
potshot out or am I--

2249
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:41,090
MATT: Was Bad News prepared?

2250
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,120
TALIESIN: It was fine, it
was working fine.

2251
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:43,600
-MATT: It was fine.
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

2252
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,860
Nothing's broke,
well, now...

2253
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:46,140
MATT: Now it is, yeah.

2254
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,400
TALIESIN: Now that's broken, okay.

2255
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,840
So, and now Bad News,
here we go.

2256
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:52,840
LIAM: Come on, Golden Snitch!

2257
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,500
Do it!

2258
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,330
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

2259
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,180
-LAURA: Yes!
-TRAVIS: On cue!

2260
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:01,360
(cheering)

2261
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:02,840
TALIESIN: Thank you, baby.

2262
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:03,630
Okay.

2263
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:08,090
MATT: So, that'll hit.

2264
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,750
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's--
let's take--

2265
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:11,840
Let's take--

2266
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,300
SAM: Weird critical
things here?

2267
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:14,570
TALIESIN: I don't do any
weird critical thing

2268
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,150
other than doing
a lot of damage.

2269
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,420
MATT: Correct.

2270
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,540
TALIESIN: Although, where's my--
I do have, okay, so--

2271
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:21,240
That does a
lot of damage.

2272
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,390
(talking over each other)

2273
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:24,330
-MARISHA: Amazing.
-TALIESIN: Double dice.

2274
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,360
TRAVIS: Come on,
you deranged--

2275
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:26,360
LIAM: Find one thing
and do it well.

2276
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,590
TALIESIN: Not bad, okay, that's--

2277
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,540
31 points of damage.

2278
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:35,180
-MATT: Alright.
-TALIESIN: That'll do.

2279
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:37,180
MATT: Very nice.

2280
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:39,800
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's 4d12,
plus six, so.

2281
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:43,540
And now I'm gonna hide
behind that dragon egg.

2282
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:46,660
MATT: Alright, so you move behind
the dragon egg right there.

2283
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:47,810
TALIESIN: Yep.

2284
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,330
Oh, and that means I get
a grit point back ah-ha!

2285
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,330
I can actually do
a thing, that's good.

2286
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,000
Okay, alrighty.

2287
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:57,000
SAM: So, things are turning around
ever since that limerick.

2288
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,600
LIAM: Watch this, I'm gonna
get turned

2289
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,060
into pulled pork right now.

2290
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,420
MATT: Well, it's the
lair actions now.

2291
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,480
So in this one...

2292
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,810
TALIESIN: The Earth itself
turns against us.

2293
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,060
(rumbles)

2294
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,850
MATT: From beneath
your feet, Grog,

2295
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:13,420
you feel and you look down
just as the rock splits

2296
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:16,050
and a spray of--
a tiny geyser of molten rock

2297
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:17,360
just sprays outward.

2298
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,270
You try and move out
of the way in time,

2299
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,650
but sprays across you,
Pike, Scanlan and Vex.

2300
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:25,340
So I need you guys all to make
dexterity saving throws.

2301
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,390
LAURA: You want to
make it for me?

2302
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,870
SAM: Natural 20, 25.

2303
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,180
MATT: Whoo! That'll do.

2304
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:36,480
TALIESIN: There's nothing
natural about 25.

2305
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:39,690
Purely artificial, you've
had work done on that 20.

2306
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,020
-SAM: This is LA.
-TALIESIN: This is LA.

2307
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:44,810
MARISHA: Lot of LA things
right back to back.

2308
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:45,866
-It's overwhelming.
-TALIESIN: Man.

2309
01:27:45,866 --> 01:27:46,923
TRAVIS: 21.

2310
01:27:46,923 --> 01:27:47,980
-MATT: 21? Succeeds.
-LAURA: Twenty.

2311
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,270
MATT: Succeeds, Pike?

2312
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,630
LIAM: Eleven for Pike.

2313
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,130
MATT: Pike does
not succeed.

2314
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:53,120
SAM: 20, 25.

2315
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:55,870
MATT: Succeed, alright, so, you
guys who all succeeded,

2316
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,870
you take 12 points
of fire damage.

2317
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,060
Half of you
are resistant.

2318
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:04,630
-SAM: So six.
-MATT: Just six.

2319
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,450
Pike takes 12 points
of fire damage

2320
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,510
because she's resistant even
though she failed her save.

2321
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:09,540
-LAURA: Okay.
-MARISHA: Oh, that's good.

2322
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:10,540
That's good.

2323
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,870
LAURA: So she's still up.

2324
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,420
-SAM: She's still alive!
-TALIESIN: She's still alive.

2325
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:16,210
SAM: Because of me, let's just
go on record and say that.

2326
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,600
TALIESIN: I'll go with that.

2327
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:20,240
LIAM: Can you say
it in Spanish?

2328
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:22,780
SAM: No, I cannot.

2329
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:25,660
-TALIESIN: Pike.
-SAM: Yo no soy Marinado.

2330
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:35,060
Alright, that brings us
back to Raishan's turn.

2331
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:36,360
LAURA: Oh God, oh God.

2332
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,420
MATT: Gets her legendary
actions back.

2333
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:43,520
TRAVIS: It's cool,
you can just go.

2334
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,600
MATT: Given the current
circumstance...

2335
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:51,030
TALIESIN: No.

2336
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,660
No.

2337
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:55,870
MATT: Raishan is going
to unleash...

2338
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,360
TRAVIS: Handshake?

2339
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:01,120
MATT: She's going to unleash a full
round of attacks against you

2340
01:29:01,150 --> 01:29:04,570
as you are right up in her face
and stabbed her in the gums

2341
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:08,330
and avoided the entirety
of her meteor swarm

2342
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,300
and you also
attacked her.

2343
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,470
TALIESIN: In defense, she had
some corn stuck in her--

2344
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,090
LAURA: Yeah, he really
was helping.

2345
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,660
It'd been there for like--

2346
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:18,200
MATT: And she appreciates that,

2347
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,630
but the rest of the
stuff is still a problem.

2348
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:22,600
TALIESIN: I'm trying not
to say anything.

2349
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:24,540
MATT: That is 22 to
hit with a bite.

2350
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:26,420
LIAM: That just hits,
Uncanny Dodge.

2351
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:30,750
SAM: Maybe you should remind
her that we have a deal.

2352
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:33,270
We're supposed to
be working together.

2353
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,180
MATT: 22, well,
yeah, so they all hit.

2354
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,070
SAM: What happened to
our deal, Raishan?

2355
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:39,680
LIAM: The first one is Uncanny
and then the rest are--

2356
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,360
MATT: Correct, so the
bite attack is halved.

2357
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,780
Which is good.

2358
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:48,330
That'll be 22 points
of piercing damage

2359
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:52,750
and you got the warm
tingle earlier, right?

2360
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:56,400
You also suffer
ten points

2361
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,140
of poison damage.

2362
01:29:58,140 --> 01:29:59,380
SAM: Ten points of poison?

2363
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,880
LAURA: Even though he's
immune to poison?

2364
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,390
MATT: He's not immune to poison.

2365
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:04,330
-LAURA: He's not?
-MATT: No.

2366
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,860
LIAM: Not from that-- so that
our Hero's Feast does nothing.

2367
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,240
LAURA: It was Dispel, she dispelled
our Heroes' Feast.

2368
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,780
That's what that
fucking shit was.

2369
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:14,090
-TRAVIS: Oh!
-LIAM: Is that the total--

2370
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,600
MATT: That was the bite attack.

2371
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,840
So that whole
attack is halved.

2372
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:21,550
The poison damage and the
piercing you took is halved.

2373
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:24,770
The claw attack...

2374
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:31,010
SAM: There was a shimmering and
you didn't feel anything.

2375
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,810
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage.

2376
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,000
LIAM: Vax is falling.

2377
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:35,030
(gasps)

2378
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,300
SAM: Oh, no.

2379
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:39,000
MATT: And the tail bats
you on the way down.

2380
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:42,420
You guys watch as the
darkened wings of Vax go limp

2381
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:44,420
and he just plummets.

2382
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:49,270
MARISHA: Oh, boy.

2383
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:53,030
SAM: That's gonna be--

2384
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:54,450
MATT: Roll a d20.

2385
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,060
LAURA: Oh, God.

2386
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,720
LIAM: Is this a death save?

2387
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:01,090
MATT: No, this is a trajectory.

2388
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,660
MARISHA: Oh my God, please
don't land in the lava.

2389
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,780
MATT: You smack right
into the edge,

2390
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:08,570
but not into
the magma river.

2391
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:15,060
You hear the cracking sound
of bones breaking upon impact

2392
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:17,510
and the wings
themselves broken.

2393
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:21,870
Feathers falling and burning
within the molten rock.

2394
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,690
The wings slowly
fold in and curl

2395
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,270
like a spider
dying and vanish.

2396
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,720
LIAM: That sucks.

2397
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,390
SAM: Forever?

2398
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:33,090
LAURA: No, not forever!

2399
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,840
TALIESIN: He just went unconscious.

2400
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,720
MATT: And with that...

2401
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,630
TALIESIN: Something's gotta
be done about that.

2402
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,090
TRAVIS: You are Anakin
on the riverbed.

2403
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,480
MARISHA: Totally.

2404
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:46,870
TALIESIN: Magma is practically like your
arch nemesis to be fair.

2405
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:48,450
LIAM: I don't-- I don't know.

2406
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,280
MATT: Raishan is going to move.

2407
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,120
(pieces crash)

2408
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,150
(shouts)

2409
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,870
MATT: Kima, no!

2410
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,390
-MARISHA: Poor Kima!
-SAM: Bye.

2411
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:00,420
I just got here!

2412
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:02,630
(indistinct talking)

2413
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:12,540
MATT: Alrighty.

2414
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:16,450
And as she emerges now, after
knocking you out of the air,

2415
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,510
wings fully out, Raishan...

2416
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:21,030
(snarling)

2417
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,210
"You're next."

2418
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,180
And then swoops over
and is now floating

2419
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,810
over the lava pool
over that way.

2420
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,870
And appears to be
preparing for something.

2421
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,180
LIAM: Have I got any automatic
fails in a death save?

2422
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,480
MATT: Yes, you did fail a death saving
throw from hitting the ground.

2423
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,440
-LIAM: Hitting the ground?
-MATT: Yes.

2424
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,060
SAM: As she does that, I yell out,
"Could you be more specific?

2425
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:41,270
Who is next, who?

2426
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:44,000
Oh, we didn't see who you
were looking at over here.

2427
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:45,120
No?

2428
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:49,270
Alright, guess
we'll find out."

2429
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,270
TRAVIS: I was so preoccupied,
I missed it.

2430
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,830
MATT: That ends Raishan's turn.

2431
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:55,810
Keyleth, you're up.

2432
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,270
MARISHA: Okay, so Keyleth,
pretty pissed off

2433
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,540
from seeing her boyfriend
spiked from the sky.

2434
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:07,690
I'm going to
kinda get a few,

2435
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,120
well, no, I guess
I can stay here.

2436
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:12,390
Kind of above the lava

2437
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:17,090
create a swirling
angry lava vortex

2438
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,870
of lightning and fire

2439
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,240
and I'm gonna hit her
again with lightning.

2440
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:21,780
MATT: Okay.

2441
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,360
Make her save.

2442
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:26,270
Save 12 plus nine that
is 21, which does save.

2443
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,420
MARISHA: Yeah, she saved.

2444
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:30,210
MATT: So takes half damage,
so 14 then halved.

2445
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,720
MARISHA: Okay, not too bad.

2446
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:37,300
Twelve, 14 plus
seven, 21 total.

2447
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:38,450
Half damage.

2448
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,840
MATT: Okay, so ten points
of lightning damage.

2449
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:42,630
MARISHA: Not great.

2450
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:46,120
MATT: Okay, did you want to move or
you gonna stay where you are?

2451
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:47,720
MARISHA: Um...

2452
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,360
TALIESIN: You can't heal as a
bonus action, can you?

2453
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:53,000
MARISHA: No, I can't do anything.

2454
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:57,390
Does-- does Vax look like he's
about to fall in the lava?

2455
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:01,450
MATT: Vax is approximately
one foot

2456
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:05,360
from the edge
of the river.

2457
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,870
SAM: One third my size.

2458
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,240
TRAVIS: Is it flat or is it...

2459
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:11,390
MATT: It's slightly domed in.

2460
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,450
MARISHA: Do you have flame
resistance right now?

2461
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,420
Yeah, you said
you're flame resistant.

2462
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,180
TALIESIN: On the armor.

2463
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:19,750
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm gonna
use my movement then.

2464
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,390
I'm gonna be very careful
to make sure I touch the armor,

2465
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:23,750
the Raven Queen armor

2466
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,630
and I'm going to see if
I can just fire elemental

2467
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:31,390
like roll him away
from the edge a little bit.

2468
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:32,750
MATT: Okay.

2469
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:35,030
LIAM: The armor is set
to flame resistance.

2470
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:36,270
MATT: Yes, it is.

2471
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,270
TRAVIS: I thought you were
saying you were gonna like

2472
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:40,540
roll him in the lava.

2473
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:41,780
MARISHA: It's been nice.

2474
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:43,690
(talking over each other)

2475
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:50,750
MATT: I will say-- I will say the
touch of a fire elemental

2476
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:52,690
ignites whatever
it touches.

2477
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:53,750
It's kind of the
essence of the element.

2478
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,060
MARISHA: But he has
fire resistance.

2479
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,060
MATT: Right, which means
he'll take half damage

2480
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,450
from any fire
that you deal.

2481
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,660
However, being the fact

2482
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:02,060
that you are in
control of your form

2483
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:03,780
you're not
trying to hurt something,

2484
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:08,030
I would say that you could
carefully push him aside

2485
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:11,450
and I'll allow you
a death saving throw

2486
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,720
as opposed to just
taking straight damage.

2487
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,750
LIAM: Okay.

2488
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:16,750
MATT: I'm making a--

2489
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:18,450
LIAM: I'm rolling an advantage.

2490
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:21,030
MATT: An advantage because
of your armor, yeah.

2491
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,240
LIAM: Twelve, succeed.

2492
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:24,570
So, we're good,
we're good.

2493
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,600
MARISHA: We're cool,
we're good.

2494
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,720
SAM: Here, let me help you.

2495
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:31,600
Oh God, I killed him.

2496
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:35,390
LIAM: I feel like in another dimension
this didn't go so well.

2497
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,360
MATT: So you kind of
roll him over...

2498
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,600
MARISHA: That would be the
most Keyleth thing to do.

2499
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:43,600
I love you so-- oh God,
I killed the thing I love.

2500
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:47,180
SAM: Oh my God, George, I hugged
the puppy really hard.

2501
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:49,750
LIAM: No, no, no!

2502
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:51,390
MARISHA: I'm sorry, George.

2503
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,660
MATT: You barely move him,

2504
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:54,750
you only get him five feet
from being so careful.

2505
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,300
You could have moved him
further, but he would have--

2506
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,000
been ignited in the process.

2507
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:59,570
TRAVIS: Oh my God.

2508
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,390
TALIESIN: I got that
extension so bad.

2509
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:04,000
MATT: Does that end your turn?

2510
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:07,330
MARISHA: I'm gonna then take a few
steps back away from him now.

2511
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,300
MATT: Okay, back this way,
back where you were?

2512
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:10,540
MARISHA: Yeah, yes.

2513
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:14,000
TRAVIS: You would have turned
into a vestige.

2514
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:15,940
TALIESIN: I don't got to
pretend I'm (indistinct).

2515
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:17,120
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn?

2516
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,120
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-MATT: Okay.

2517
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:19,450
At the end of your turn.

2518
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,270
Raishan is still overhead
and casts a spell.

2519
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,660
-LIAM: Duvet, Duvall?
-TRAVIS: Duvet.

2520
01:36:30,690 --> 01:36:32,630
MATT: Alrighty.

2521
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:36,480
You watch as Raishan
over on the edge...

2522
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:41,180
her front claws
begin to form

2523
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:44,150
this strange
geometric sigil

2524
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,480
in the middle of the air

2525
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:47,390
and each corner of it
is a different color.

2526
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:51,720
Green, orange, yellow,
red, purple, blue.

2527
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:54,350
And suddenly
this giant burst--

2528
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,000
SAM: Can I try to
counterspell her?

2529
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:57,510
MATT: What's the
range on that?

2530
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,180
SAM: 60 feet,
am I just there?

2531
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:00,630
MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan.

2532
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:01,690
LAURA: Oh God, Scanlan.

2533
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,390
TRAVIS: What is she casting?

2534
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,570
MATT: She's within range!

2535
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,180
-LAURA: Oh, God!
-TALIESIN: Please, please!

2536
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:07,840
Please kill it!

2537
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:10,600
MATT: d20 add six.

2538
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:12,120
SAM: Eighteen.

2539
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:13,300
MATT: You rolled an 18?

2540
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:14,720
SAM: No, I rolled a 12.

2541
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:17,210
MATT: You rolled a 12,
that's an 18 total?

2542
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,090
It is a...

2543
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:21,510
Hold on a second.

2544
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,600
TALIESIN: God, I can't breathe.

2545
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:24,290
MATT: I'm pretty sure...

2546
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:29,360
SAM: I get a plus two for--

2547
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:31,030
MATT: Right, oh, I know.

2548
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:33,180
The sigil-- as the
burst of colored light

2549
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:35,780
begins to spray forward,
you watch as it just...

2550
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:40,150
(cheering)

2551
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,190
LAURA: Scanlan! MVP!

2552
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,030
LIAM: Vax wakes up for
two seconds, says,

2553
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,390
"You da man!" and
then lies back down.

2554
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,480
(laughter)

2555
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:51,720
MATT: Shit.

2556
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,330
I never get to
use Prismatic Spray.

2557
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,120
TRAVIS: That was a day
ruiner, right?

2558
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:57,150
Day ruiner.

2559
01:37:57,180 --> 01:38:00,860
(talking over each other)

2560
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:03,480
There's no chance that was
like a healing spray, was it?

2561
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,000
LIAM: Probably not.

2562
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:06,910
TRAVIS: Like the gesture
of surrender?

2563
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:09,330
LIAM: It was kind of
like rainbows.

2564
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,510
TALIESIN: It's the angriest Captain
Planet-- it's just the worst--

2565
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:17,150
MARISHA: Like the most fucked
up Care Bear stare.

2566
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:22,120
MATT: Alright, so, as the
spell dissipates...

2567
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,810
Raishan angrily...

2568
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,810
SAM: ♪ You got eggs and
you gonna lose 'em ♪

2569
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,300
♪ You got eggs ♪♪

2570
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:33,660
LAURA: Oh God.

2571
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,390
MATT: Alright, so that ends--
that ends Keyleth's turn.

2572
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:39,210
That brings us to Gilmore.

2573
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,210
Now, Gilmore over here is--

2574
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,570
what else does he have
left in the tank here?

2575
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:51,480
He's gonna do a level
four Lightning Bolt.

2576
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,540
TALIESIN: Chromatic spray.

2577
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:55,970
SAM: Chromatic spray could have
been many things though.

2578
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:57,540
TALIESIN: Yes, but they're all bad.

2579
01:38:57,570 --> 01:39:00,160
-It's a wheel of death.
-SAM: And they're all bad.

2580
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,120
One of them's
like 70 points of...

2581
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:05,180
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Of just-- just goop.

2582
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:08,180
MARISHA: Each color
is like bad.

2583
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:10,050
MATT: Gilmore is going to...

2584
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,780
TALIESIN: It's a great way of dealing
with people who are--

2585
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:16,060
who are attuned
to deal with you.

2586
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:18,510
(indistinct talking)

2587
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:23,150
TALIESIN: You were looking
at that for a while.

2588
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:24,630
SAM: Yeah, I was, it was good.

2589
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:27,390
-It looks good.
-TALIESIN: It's really good.

2590
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,360
-It's very you too.
-SAM: Rainbow colored.

2591
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:36,660
MATT: Sorry.

2592
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:38,600
LAURA: Check out those
Gilmore t-shirts.

2593
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:40,330
MATT: I know, sorry, I'm
checking to make sure

2594
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:42,090
he can do this cause this
is what he's trying to do.

2595
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,090
LIAM: Gilmore's wearing
one right now.

2596
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,330
SAM: Hey, Laura, are those
key chains laser etched?

2597
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,360
LAURA: Why, they are!

2598
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:50,510
It's so funny
you should ask.

2599
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:51,690
SAM: Wow, what about the--

2600
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,060
LAURA: So precise.

2601
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:54,360
SAM: Did I say the key chain
or the necklace?

2602
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:55,450
What about the necklace?

2603
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,980
MATT: So, Gilmore--
Gilmore runs up.

2604
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:01,750
And just vanishes
from his place

2605
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:05,240
and instantly blinks
up over into this area

2606
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:08,360
using his misty step
as his bonus action.

2607
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:10,300
And looks upward.

2608
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:11,570
"How do you like it?"

2609
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,780
Raises his hand
and pulls this way.

2610
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:15,540
You watch as this
necromantic energy

2611
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:17,190
begins to gather
around his hands.

2612
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:19,480
A familiar spell
to you, Keyleth.

2613
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:22,090
As you watch the
diseased blackened veins

2614
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,480
up the side of Raishan's
body begin to spread

2615
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:27,870
and grow momentarily
and kind of begin to--

2616
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,880
to dig their way
into her throat.

2617
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,300
She begins
to pull backward,

2618
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:35,570
unfamiliar with this
sudden internal pain.

2619
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,810
Rolls a natural
20 for her save.

2620
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,240
But regardless,
that's still--

2621
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:41,810
LAURA: I like how he genuinely
looked kind of disappointed

2622
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,210
though that
he rolled a 20.

2623
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,360
TRAVIS: I think he's just--

2624
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:45,420
LAURA: It made me--
it made me feel great.

2625
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:46,720
LIAM: He's a really good actor.

2626
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,840
SAM: See, we're not even
gonna need the flute guy.

2627
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,300
LAURA: I hope he shows up.

2628
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,570
I hope he's not like...

2629
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,180
TALIESIN: No, a month from
now he's gonna show up.

2630
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:56,840
TRAVIS: Attacking like
his carry-on?

2631
01:40:56,870 --> 01:40:59,630
SAM: He's at TSA right now.

2632
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:01,510
"I have nothing
else metal on me.

2633
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:04,690
I don't-- oh, I'm bronze."

2634
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:10,300
MATT: Seventeen points of necrotic
damage to Raishan with the save.

2635
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,330
That's Gilmore's
turn there.

2636
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,930
That brings us to...

2637
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,210
Grog.

2638
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,570
-TRAVIS: Me?
-MATT: Yes.

2639
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,420
TALIESIN: Your dragon-based humor
is way too tight right now.

2640
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:25,210
TRAVIS: Can I run
over with Shaun?

2641
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,670
MATT: Yeah.

2642
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:30,330
TRAVIS: Can I attach the Chain
of Returning to the axe?

2643
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:31,510
MATT: Yes.

2644
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,480
TRAVIS: Then, can I swing
it really hard and go,

2645
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:34,810
"Yeah, catchphrase!"

2646
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,030
and throw it up.

2647
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,330
(laughter)

2648
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,660
MATT: Yes, you can.

2649
01:41:39,690 --> 01:41:41,060
TRAVIS: Good, reckless, please.

2650
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,250
MATT: Yes, you may.

2651
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:44,420
-SAM: Laura.
-TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

2652
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:47,750
-MARISHA: Whoo!
-MATT: Oh, shit!

2653
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:49,720
Alright.

2654
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:53,120
TRAVIS: Oh, and with the
brutal critical,

2655
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:54,360
I get two additional...

2656
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:56,580
MATT: Yeah, two additional
d12's to that,

2657
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:57,780
so roll the die first.

2658
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:07,330
Plus don't forget you
double the necrotic die.

2659
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,390
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do double it?

2660
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:12,720
MATT: Yeah.

2661
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:13,810
LIAM: Yes!

2662
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,570
TRAVIS: That's a six,
so that's 12.

2663
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,600
I'm enlarged. Where's the triangle,
who took the triangle?

2664
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:22,180
LAURA: I don't-- here you go.

2665
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:23,870
TALIESIN: You got like
valley girl on that.

2666
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,390
"Who took the triangle?"

2667
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,930
TRAVIS: That's 29 and then
two additional d12.

2668
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:29,170
MATT: Correct.

2669
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:34,210
TRAVIS: Nine, 38.

2670
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,420
Ten, 48.

2671
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:37,400
MATT: 48?

2672
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:41,510
Okay.

2673
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:43,270
LAURA: Did you double
those extras?

2674
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:44,270
Do you double
those dice as well?

2675
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,390
-TRAVIS: No.
-LAURA: Okay.

2676
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:46,780
TRAVIS: Brutal critical, you get
two additional damage

2677
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:48,390
die on my roll.

2678
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:50,660
MATT: Okay, so, as you rush up,
"Catchphrase!"

2679
01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:53,780
and throw the
axe sideways.

2680
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:55,870
It arcs upward and
Raishan is currently

2681
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,510
kind of reeling
from the dispel

2682
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:01,660
and angrily yelling
into the room in draconic.

2683
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:04,450
Gets partway into a phrase,
just finishing...

2684
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,720
(roaring)

2685
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:09,090
The axe just jams into the
side of her collarbone

2686
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:12,090
and front torso area and...

2687
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:16,790
The axe is still kind of wedged
there, are you gonna pull back?

2688
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:18,570
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll
pull it back.

2689
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,450
MATT: So go ahead
and roll your...

2690
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,180
TALIESIN: I don't know why you're
looking over here for that.

2691
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:24,750
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got it. 23.

2692
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,720
MATT: So, yanking the axe, dislodges
itself and you catch it.

2693
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:33,000
You see it's covered
in Raishan blood.

2694
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:35,300
As you pull the axe back, you
watch as something just, like,

2695
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:37,480
a flash of arcane
energy around her,

2696
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:39,300
and some sort of spell,

2697
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:41,510
uncast by her,
just seemingly

2698
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:44,030
automatically just
kind of surrounds her

2699
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:47,360
and her flying
begins to speed up.

2700
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,570
LAURA: She got hasted?

2701
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,870
-MARISHA: But how?
-LAURA: How?

2702
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,600
TRAVIS: I didn't know
I was this powerful.

2703
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:56,360
What the fuck happened?

2704
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:57,870
LAURA: How did she get hasted?

2705
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,120
LIAM: Well, we'll find out.

2706
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:02,720
LAURA: What if the brass
dragon's helping her?

2707
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:05,810
TALIESIN: Or what if the eggs
are helping her?

2708
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,210
MATT: Yeah, you have
maybe 15 more feet.

2709
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,920
TALIESIN: I don't know, I just like
putting things out there.

2710
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,600
TRAVIS: Rolling towards that end
of the map as far as I go.

2711
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:15,360
MATT: This end, sure.

2712
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:16,670
LAURA: That end of the map.

2713
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:18,690
TRAVIS: Can I go that way?

2714
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:21,120
Yeah, that's cool.

2715
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:22,810
-Cool.
-MATT: Great.

2716
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,000
LAURA: Oh God.

2717
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:26,650
MATT: That puts you at
the end of your turn.

2718
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:30,840
She's gonna use
legendary action.

2719
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:34,120
At this point in her kind of,
sped up form, she begins to...

2720
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:36,030
(chanting)

2721
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:39,330
And there's a slight
ripple again in the air

2722
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:44,030
similar to what Gilmore
did towards Raishan

2723
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,570
early part of the battle.

2724
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,420
Let me see the...

2725
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:52,120
TALIESIN: We're making some bad groupings
there, by the way, people.

2726
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:53,690
MATT: Yeah.

2727
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:01,480
You feel a kind
of a strange warmth

2728
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:04,510
and tingling sensation
within your body, Scanlan.

2729
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:06,660
SAM: Oh, what, me?

2730
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:08,680
But I didn't
do anything.

2731
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,120
TALIESIN: You relieve
yourself gently.

2732
01:45:12,150 --> 01:45:14,810
LAURA: Did you just pee?

2733
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,240
TALIESIN: I cast Tinkle.

2734
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:17,840
SAM: I don't get to save or
anything, it just happens?

2735
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:19,810
MATT: It's not a save, it's
against an effect on you

2736
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,270
and she rolls to--
just like how you roll

2737
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:23,360
to overcome her
spell's counter spell,

2738
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:24,600
she gets to roll
to overcome

2739
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:26,030
whatever effect is on
you with dispel magic.

2740
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,450
SAM: Okay.

2741
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:31,420
MATT: So, that's gonna be the last
of her legendary actions.

2742
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,210
LAURA: She just dispelled all of us.

2743
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,180
Can we bust out
a feast right now?

2744
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,690
-Just like sit down.
-TALIESIN: We can make eggs benedict.

2745
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:40,300
We have the makings
for eggs benedict.

2746
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:44,120
SAM: Does that dispel my fire
resistance as well?

2747
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:46,090
MATT: No, it only affected
the Heroes' Feast.

2748
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:47,220
SAM: Okay.

2749
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,210
You'll have to
explain that sometime.

2750
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,000
MATT: Vex, you're up.

2751
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:52,750
LAURA: So, giving a potion to
somebody is a full action?

2752
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:55,240
MATT: Yes.

2753
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:57,120
Cause you have to basically
get there, open it,

2754
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,720
grab them and help
them swallow it

2755
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,240
to have the
effect take place.

2756
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:03,150
It's a pretty
involved action.

2757
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:05,750
SAM: That means we don't have
advantage on death saves either.

2758
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:07,180
Right, wait.

2759
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:08,630
-LAURA: Did we ever?
-SAM: Yeah, we did.

2760
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,180
LAURA: Oh, that's from
Beacon of Hope.

2761
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:11,480
That's gone anyway.

2762
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:12,540
SAM: Is that gone, okay?

2763
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:14,030
TALIESIN: Yeah, that got eaten.

2764
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,990
LAURA: Okay, then I'm gonna
fly down to my brother.

2765
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,360
And I'm gonna
cast Cure Wounds

2766
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:23,780
on him at fourth level,

2767
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:26,210
so that's 4d8.

2768
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,570
SAM: 4d8?

2769
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:39,120
♪

2770
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:40,720
LAURA: Oh, 19 plus
eight, wow, 27.

2771
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:43,600
-SAM: Wow.
-LIAM: Thank you.

2772
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:47,190
LAURA: You don't got
no wings anymore.

2773
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:49,000
-LIAM: She dead?
-LAURA: No.

2774
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:50,780
LIAM: Oh, shit.

2775
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:52,450
LAURA: Get away
from the lava.

2776
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:56,300
And then, I'm gonna
fly away from the lava.

2777
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:57,840
-Up.
-MATT: This way?

2778
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:59,240
-TRAVIS: Towards Matt.
-LAURA: Yeah, towards Matt.

2779
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:00,600
Up and towards Matt.

2780
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,390
-MATT: Up and towards me.
-LAURA: Kind of away from Pike.

2781
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:05,180
Actually,
let's go, oh God.

2782
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:06,480
MATT: This way?

2783
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:09,220
LAURA: Yes, yes, what
you just did.

2784
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:11,750
That way.

2785
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:14,350
MATT: That's about as far
as you can go right there.

2786
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:15,120
Okay.

2787
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:16,150
LAURA: And I get a bonus.

2788
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,750
I can do something
with a bonus.

2789
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:20,240
I'm gonna
re-Hunter's Mark her.

2790
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:22,160
-MATT: Yeah, cause you--
-LAURA: Yeah.

2791
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:24,030
MATT: Alright, so
Hunter's Mark reapplied.

2792
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:25,210
LAURA: Oh, wait!

2793
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,190
I can take a potion
for myself as a bonus.

2794
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:28,540
-MATT: Yes.
-LAURA: I'm gonna do that.

2795
01:47:28,570 --> 01:47:29,540
MATT: Alright, go for it.

2796
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:30,600
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2797
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,390
-Get it.
-LAURA: Okay.

2798
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:33,600
MATT: Just a regular potion?

2799
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:36,240
-LAURA: Just a Superior.
-MATT: Oh, right.

2800
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:37,750
LAURA: That my brother gave me.

2801
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:40,000
MATT: That is an
8d4 plus eight.

2802
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:44,000
LAURA: It's a four.

2803
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,870
TRAVIS: Easter egg.

2804
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:57,750
LAURA: Seventeen plus eight.

2805
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,620
TRAVIS: You have one
more dice to roll.

2806
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,090
-LAURA: I do?
-TRAVIS: Yep.

2807
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,240
LAURA: Ooh.

2808
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:04,480
So, 21 plus
eight, so 29.

2809
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:05,660
MATT: Nice.

2810
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:07,720
SAM: You healed
yourself that much?

2811
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:09,540
Jesus, that's
a big potion.

2812
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:11,570
LAURA: Yeah that was,
I rolled really well.

2813
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,570
TALIESIN: I may make one
for the table.

2814
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:16,390
LAURA: I didn't trust that
I would roll that well.

2815
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:18,240
MATT: That ends your turn, Vex?

2816
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:19,600
-LAURA: Yes.
-MATT: Vax, you're up.

2817
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:21,150
LIAM: Okay, so half my movement just
to get to standing, right?

2818
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:22,390
MATT: Correct.

2819
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:25,750
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna throw
Whisper, Flame tongue.

2820
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:27,630
Raishan should be
within 60 feet, yeah?

2821
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:30,120
-MATT: Uh, yeah.
-LIAM: Okay.

2822
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:36,360
-Seventeen for the first.
-MATT: Fails.

2823
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:39,000
-LIAM: Second is 22.
-MATT: Twenty-two just hits.

2824
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,060
TRAVIS: That's it, that's
Raishan at 22.

2825
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:45,300
-LIAM: Ten.
-TALIESIN: 22?

2826
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:46,450
-MARISHA: She's 22.
-MATT: How much damage?

2827
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,780
-LIAM: Ten.
-MATT: Ten points damage.

2828
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:52,090
LIAM: And I'm going to use my
remaining 15 of movement

2829
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:56,660
to go diagonally
away from Raishan.

2830
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:58,120
MATT: Diagonally away this way?

2831
01:48:58,150 --> 01:48:59,810
LIAM: Away from-- diagonal.

2832
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,390
-MATT: Here?
-LIAM: Yeah.

2833
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:03,390
MATT: Okay, that's as far
as you can get there.

2834
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:04,750
Okay.

2835
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,120
That ends your turn.

2836
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:09,260
That brings us to Kima.

2837
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:14,000
Let's see.

2838
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:15,840
Kima rushes in with
Holy Avenger,

2839
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:19,820
and looks over at the distant
dragon and goes, "Oh, shit.

2840
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,660
Who's hurting?"

2841
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:23,230
LAURA: Everyone.

2842
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,240
SAM: I'm fine.

2843
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:28,360
LAURA (as PIKE): "I am, I don't want
to say anything though,

2844
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:29,570
but I kind of am.

2845
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:30,850
I feel kind of shitty.

2846
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,270
I--I feel like shit."

2847
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:42,000
-LIAM: "Um..."
-LAURA: "Um..."

2848
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:44,690
SAM: "I'm kind of bleeding
from my ears, but, whatever."

2849
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:48,210
MATT: Kima as an action
is gonna cast a...

2850
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:49,870
LAURA: "I can deal with it.

2851
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:51,450
It's no big deal."

2852
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,750
MATT: I'm gonna say third
level Cure Wounds.

2853
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:01,510
LIAM: Matt, my wings
are toast, right?

2854
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:02,660
MATT: Yeah.

2855
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:05,180
That's 17 points
of healing to Pike.

2856
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:07,660
LAURA: Okay, thank you.

2857
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:10,450
MATT: I think Kima's just
gonna go at a full run.

2858
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:13,060
(indistinct talking)

2859
01:50:13,090 --> 01:50:15,480
Right, that ends Kima's turn.

2860
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:18,210
There is a
flash of light

2861
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:22,060
in the tunnel
behind you guys.

2862
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:24,850
As a sudden burst
of kind of...

2863
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:29,150
a whitish orangish energy

2864
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:33,380
that briefly halos Kima,
Scanlan, and Pike's forms.

2865
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:38,390
As you watch,
a brass talon...

2866
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:41,390
(cheering)

2867
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:45,060
A brass talon, that since it was
used as the top of our tree,

2868
01:50:45,090 --> 01:50:48,760
I forgot to bring its base,
but he'll be acting there.

2869
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,570
TALIESIN: It was a beautiful tree.

2870
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,630
-LAURA: Hey, look, he's standing!
-MARISHA: He's standing.

2871
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:55,780
TALIESIN: You've been drinking,
brass dragon.

2872
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,660
LAURA: Oh, J'Mon,
you looking good.

2873
01:50:57,690 --> 01:50:59,840
-LIAM: J'Mon!
-LAURA: J'Mon!

2874
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:01,180
TALIESIN: Have you been
working out?

2875
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:02,840
You look like you've
been working out.

2876
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:05,750
MATT: He watches as they arrive

2877
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:10,700
and kind of bully
their way past the entrance.

2878
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:15,150
"I was wondering
when you'd call."

2879
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,090
SAM: Glad you came!

2880
01:51:19,025 --> 01:51:21,055
TRAVIS: Nothing cool,
nothing cool with that!

2881
01:51:21,055 --> 01:51:22,840
TALIESIN: Swipe right, swipe right!

2882
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,660
TRAVIS: Sure is glad
you're here!

2883
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:26,770
SAM: We're happy
to see you?

2884
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:31,060
TRAVIS: No court speak here.

2885
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:33,230
SAM: How-- how
was the flight?

2886
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:36,180
MATT: Actually,
I broke my platforms,

2887
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:39,060
so I'll just have to use my
imagination for some of this.

2888
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:41,030
SAM: We need modeling
clay, quick!

2889
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:44,460
TALIESIN: Fishing wire, we can just string
it from the top of the set.

2890
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,570
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, just
attach it to a string.

2891
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,950
MATT: There we go.

2892
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:53,600
J'Mon, they kind of stomp
their way into the room,

2893
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:55,060
stepping over
you, Scanlan.

2894
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:59,780
Stepping
past you, Vax.

2895
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:02,830
Nestles in, kind of
surveys the territory.

2896
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,420
"A different color
than I was expecting."

2897
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:16,470
And releases a blast
of fire breath

2898
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:18,130
upwards in
the direction--

2899
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:19,780
TRAVIS: Smoke 'em if
you got 'em.

2900
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:21,450
C'mon, J'Mon.

2901
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,660
LAURA: ♪ J'Mon ♪
TALIESIN: ♪ J'Mon ♪♪

2902
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:31,060
MATT: That is a 23.

2903
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:33,510
Okay, makes
the dex save,

2904
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:35,810
so Raishan pulls
out of the way

2905
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,110
with a benefit from
the haste spell.

2906
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:41,890
However it does still
take damage.

2907
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:44,540
Half damage
from the spell.

2908
01:52:44,570 --> 01:52:47,570
That's 16d6 damage.

2909
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:51,540
-LAURA: Wow.
-TRAVIS: 16d6.

2910
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:53,330
Well, that might actually help.

2911
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:55,730
LIAM: Nobody expects
the Marquette inquisition.

2912
01:52:56,330 --> 01:52:58,770
MATT: That is 58
points fire damage,

2913
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:00,360
half of that to 20...

2914
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:05,540
29, whoo, pardon me.

2915
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:06,570
LAURA: Did you just burp
or did you just--

2916
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:07,750
MATT: I did.

2917
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:10,230
MATT: Twenty nine points of
fire damage to Raishan

2918
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:14,000
from Devo'ssa's
Flame breath.

2919
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:16,660
J'Mon Sa Ord, as you know.

2920
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:17,660
TRAVIS: Wow.

2921
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:19,420
MATT: She makes a concentration check.

2922
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:20,540
Succeeds.

2923
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:22,360
TRAVIS: Damn it.

2924
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:25,660
MATT: So, the haste
remains viable.

2925
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:29,060
Okay, that ends
J'Mon's turn.

2926
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:30,450
Pike is up.

2927
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,870
LAURA: Okay.

2928
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:32,820
Pike...

2929
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:37,060
MARISHA: Go on, girl!

2930
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:45,390
LAURA: She's gonna cast
Mass Healing Word.

2931
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:47,660
Can she get the most people
in her radius?

2932
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:49,180
MATT: What's the range on it?

2933
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:50,810
LAURA: It is a 60 foot radius.

2934
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:52,450
SAM: Radius?

2935
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:55,810
MATT: Yep, that's the biggest
radius, it'd be right there.

2936
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,450
In the center,
just under

2937
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:00,090
J'Mon's giant
brass dragon wing.

2938
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:02,210
LAURA: Okay.

2939
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,390
SAM: It's not gonna heal
Raishan, is it?

2940
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,450
-LAURA: No.
-MATT: No.

2941
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,120
LAURA: Heals only
people she wants.

2942
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:07,870
It's up to
six creatures.

2943
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,690
MATT: Up to six creatures,
who do you choose?

2944
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,120
LAURA: Who all's--

2945
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:14,000
TALIESIN: Raise your hand if you would--
you would like to be--

2946
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,240
LAURA: So, that's--

2947
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:17,700
-LIAM: Grog is within range.
-LAURA: Grog and her.

2948
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:20,940
So, that's Grog,
Pike, Vex, Vax, and Percy.

2949
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:22,600
SAM: Well, hey, if
you can do six.

2950
01:54:22,630 --> 01:54:25,210
LAURA: And Scanlan.

2951
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,120
"Oh, sorry, Scanlan,
I didn't see you there."

2952
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:30,010
SAM: "Well, I'm behind a
dragon, honey, it's okay."

2953
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:34,690
LAURA: Oh, he's gonna
dispel this shit.

2954
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,020
TALIESIN: I don't think she can.

2955
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:37,690
LAURA: Okay, she's gonna do this.

2956
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:39,780
SAM: Wait, can she do it
on herself as well?

2957
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:41,180
-LAURA: Yeah.
-SAM: Okay.

2958
01:54:45,450 --> 01:54:47,090
LAURA: Nine.

2959
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,450
-SAM: Nine-- nine points?
-LAURA: Yeah.

2960
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:52,600
That's a bonus,
I know, I know, okay.

2961
01:54:52,630 --> 01:54:54,550
TALIESIN: Nine is good.

2962
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:56,760
LAURA: There's not really
anything else right now.

2963
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,310
TALIESIN: Technically, it's
9 times 6,

2964
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:59,660
so you did a
lot of healing.

2965
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:01,590
LAURA: All of her major
spells were used.

2966
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:03,780
-LIAM: Still in the game.
-TALIESIN: Nine times six is a lot.

2967
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:05,360
TRAVIS: Nine points, okay.

2968
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:07,810
TALIESIN: That brings me up
into the 60's.

2969
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,180
SAM: Decadent.

2970
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:12,310
MARISHA: Just a-- a nice
southern California day.

2971
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:15,090
TALIESIN: Fifties.

2972
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:18,330
LAURA: And then, can she-- does
she have any movement left?

2973
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:22,090
MATT: No, that was her full
movement to get there.

2974
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,660
(indistinct talking)

2975
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,480
LAURA: That's true.

2976
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:31,540
She's gonna duck as much
as she can under J'Mon.

2977
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:33,750
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: For protection.

2978
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:37,090
And say, "Oh, you look
very nice, thank you."

2979
01:55:37,090 --> 01:55:39,650
(laughing)

2980
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:40,720
MATT: There you go.

2981
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:42,660
LAURA: "Thank you for
helping us."

2982
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:44,030
SAM: At this point,
I feel like you guys

2983
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:45,870
are better at
Ashley than she is.

2984
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:47,490
LAURA: No, shut up.

2985
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:51,330
MATT: Alrighty.

2986
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,550
TALIESIN: Cast of thousands it
takes to play Ashley.

2987
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:55,660
MATT: Ending Pike's turn,
Scanlan, you're up.

2988
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:58,660
SAM: Oh, oh, shit, I should have
been thinking about what I--

2989
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,800
MATT: Yes, you should have.

2990
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:03,870
SAM: Okay.

2991
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,720
I will-- I will--

2992
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:10,510
I will shoot some stuff
at Raishan of it all.

2993
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:12,210
MATT: Do it, what are you doing?

2994
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:16,120
SAM: I'm gonna shoot
Lightning Bolt at Raishan.

2995
01:56:16,150 --> 01:56:17,600
From my dick.

2996
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:20,750
(laughter)

2997
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:22,370
MARISHA: Yes.

2998
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:25,300
MATT: So, as you begin
creating your incantation

2999
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:28,630
and thrust your
hips forward,

3000
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:32,060
J'Mon Sa Ord turns
their head beneath the wing

3001
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:36,060
in your direction and
arcs a brow, surprised.

3002
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:39,030
SAM: Like, yeah,
this is happening.

3003
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:41,780
MATT: As the bolt of energy streaks
forth from your groin

3004
01:56:41,810 --> 01:56:43,580
in the direction
of the dragon.

3005
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:48,540
That is a 15.

3006
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:53,000
It's going to use one of
Raishan's legendary resistances

3007
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:54,210
to resist it.

3008
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,360
So half damage.

3009
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:57,180
SAM: Okay, fine, whatever.

3010
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:59,160
TRAVIS: "Fine, whatever."

3011
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,510
SAM: Okay.

3012
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:07,120
TRAVIS: ♪Feel the heat.♪

3013
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,480
SAM: Wow.

3014
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:11,060
-SAM: 35 halved.
-MATT: 35 halved.

3015
01:57:11,090 --> 01:57:11,800
SAM: 17.

3016
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,920
MATT: That's a
good roll.

3017
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,150
SAM: That is a
good roll.

3018
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:15,570
It was mostly
sixes and fives.

3019
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,920
MATT: Alrighty.

3020
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:19,300
And do you wish to move or
you gonna stay where you are?

3021
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:20,290
SAM: Oh.

3022
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:26,150
No, I would
like to move.

3023
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:29,810
I would like to move forward
a bit still within the--

3024
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,400
the Devo'ssa range.

3025
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:34,690
MATT: Like by Pike and
Kima over here?

3026
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:37,300
SAM: Yeah, oh, can I move to
the other side of Devo'ssa?

3027
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:39,420
MATT: Yeah, you can move
just underneath,

3028
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:41,260
running between the legs

3029
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:42,300
and get about there.

3030
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:48,420
SAM: And yeah, shoot, is anyone
else-- how's Gilmore look?

3031
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:51,270
MATT: Gilmore is standing

3032
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,540
and seems to be
doing alright,

3033
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:55,120
but seen a lot struggle
from the last battle

3034
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:57,150
and is currently about...

3035
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,920
You can see
a little bit of blood

3036
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,060
dried and curling from one side
of the mouth.

3037
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:02,850
Hair is mussed up
and looks to be

3038
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:05,390
a few burn marks
across the skin

3039
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:07,270
and is kind of a little out of breath,

3040
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:08,690
but is standing.

3041
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,600
TALIESIN: It's the level two
Mike Tyson's punch out.

3042
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:12,240
MATT: Yeah.

3043
01:58:12,270 --> 01:58:14,120
Gilmore's
roughly half out.

3044
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:16,310
-SAM: Okay.
-TALIESIN: I knew that would break you.

3045
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:17,630
TRAVIS: I love that reference.

3046
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:20,630
SAM: So I will use a Healing Word
on Gilmore.

3047
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:22,630
Why not?

3048
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:24,180
'Cause I don't
want to use any--

3049
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:27,100
I got one more Inspiration,
so I'm not gonna use that yet.

3050
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,450
So, yeah, I will--
I will heal Gilmore.

3051
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,780
MATT: Okay.

3052
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,760
SAM: Oh, yes, sorry,
I got to roll.

3053
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:38,650
Nine.

3054
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:42,460
MATT: Total nine,
great, alrighty.

3055
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:46,390
That ends your turn?

3056
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:48,720
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

3057
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,480
MATT: Alright, Percival,
you're up.

3058
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:51,660
TRAVIS: Nice job.

3059
01:58:51,690 --> 01:58:53,760
TALIESIN: Okay, I don't
have it marked down

3060
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,240
that I burned
my action surge,

3061
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:56,750
but I think I burned
my action surge.

3062
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:58,300
MATT: You did, yes.

3063
01:58:58,330 --> 01:59:00,870
TALIESIN: But I still do have two
points of Cabal's Ruin.

3064
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,830
-If I recall.
-MATT: You do, yes.

3065
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:04,360
TALIESIN: Okay, just
making sure.

3066
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:06,900
Alright, so, I'm going to--

3067
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:08,450
from my little
vantage point,

3068
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,450
take a shot with Bad News.

3069
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:14,210
See how this goes, and I'm
gonna burn a Grit for advantage.

3070
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:15,360
Let's do this.

3071
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:19,570
♪

3072
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,000
Yeah.

3073
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:24,030
I mean, that wasn't fine,
but we could do better.

3074
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:26,210
Yeah, that's
already better.

3075
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,360
TRAVIS: Come on.

3076
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:29,110
TALIESIN: Thirty points to--
30 to hit.

3077
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:30,540
MATT: Thirty does hit, yes.

3078
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:32,060
TALIESIN: Alright.

3233
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:33,690
Taking four points
of bludgeoning damage,

3234
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:35,750
you suffer a death saving
throw from the impact.

3235
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:37,710
LAURA: From like a teeny
little ten foot fall?

3236
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:39,270
MATT: 10 foot drop on your head.

3237
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:41,270
LAURA: That's fucking stupid.

3238
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:43,240
-MATT: It's only a--
-LAURA: She was sitting stupidly!

3239
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:44,570
MATT: It's only a d6
bludgeoning damage,

3240
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:46,030
but when you're
unconscious while falling,

3241
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:48,940
you now realize the downside
of flying all the time.

3242
02:06:48,940 --> 02:06:49,900
LAURA: Damn it!

3243
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:51,780
TRAVIS: Didn't you put
air bags on that thing?

3244
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:53,630
LAURA: I did, I have
a helmet on.

3245
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:56,300
Did you-- I put
airbags in the witch's hat.

3246
02:06:56,330 --> 02:06:57,510
TALIESIN: It's a football helmet.

3247
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:59,520
TRAVIS: That's right,
it's magic, it goes...

3248
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:02,720
SAM: Yeah, I forgot to tell you,
the witch hat is magic.

3249
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:04,780
TALIESIN: Full of balloons.

3250
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:06,960
MATT: As the poisonous
breath billows out

3251
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,150
and everyone's coughing
and falling over,

3252
02:07:09,180 --> 02:07:11,060
you watch the twins
fall unconscious,

3253
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:12,900
Raishan kind of grins.

3254
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:17,540
"You've got a
few surprises, I see,

3255
02:07:17,570 --> 02:07:20,390
but you're not
the only ones."

3256
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:23,000
LAURA: Oh, no, does she
have more surprises?

3257
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:25,010
TRAVIS: I think that's
what she meant, yeah.

3258
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:28,420
LAURA: I hope that's not--

3259
02:07:28,450 --> 02:07:29,720
TALIESIN: There's cake and
ice cream upstairs.

3260
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:31,570
SAM: "I have more surprises."

3261
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:33,780
"Guys, I think she
has more surprises."

3262
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,630
TRAVIS: That's literally
what she just said.

3263
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:39,330
LAURA: I just thought maybe
the breath was the surprise.

3264
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:43,750
MATT: And then is going to use
the rest of her movement

3265
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:45,600
to whip over here.

3266
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:50,840
TRAVIS: Damn it, damn it, damn it.

3267
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:52,180
Why'd she have to leave?

3268
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:53,900
I just wanted to
give her a high five.

3269
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:56,280
TALIESIN: You need to heal the living
hell out of these people.

3270
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:57,030
LAURA: Damn it!

3271
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,120
She's carrying...?

3272
02:07:58,150 --> 02:08:00,300
MATT: She's carrying
two eggs underneath.

3273
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:01,840
TALIESIN: Which means she obviously
can't do claw attacks.

3274
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,420
MATT: She still has
40 feet of movement.

3275
02:08:03,450 --> 02:08:04,810
LAURA: That's true.

3276
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:08,180
MATT: And is going
to turn back,

3277
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:11,350
and flies there.

3278
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:15,270
TRAVIS: Didn't pick up
anything else?

3279
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,000
MATT: No, she grabbed the
two eggs and is positioning.

3280
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,140
Alright, that ends
Raishan's turn.

3281
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:24,420
Keyleth, you're up.

3282
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:26,120
TALIESIN: Can you heal?

3283
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:28,170
MARISHA: I'm wondering if
I should drop this

3284
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:30,000
and start doing
beefier stuff now.

3285
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,120
LAURA: Yeah.

3286
02:08:31,150 --> 02:08:32,750
MARISHA: I think now's the time.

3287
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:37,660
SAM: This has only injured
Vax so far, so...

3288
02:08:37,690 --> 02:08:38,780
LAURA: Me and...

3289
02:08:38,810 --> 02:08:40,380
TALIESIN: The twins, they're
both unconscious.

3290
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:41,270
SAM: Oh, great.

3291
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:43,830
TALIESIN: With one death saving
throw already failed.

3292
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:45,060
SAM: Great.

3293
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:46,630
LAURA: No, just me.

3294
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:51,090
MARISHA: Okay, I am going
to move from--

3295
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:53,150
LAURA: And Pike's like out.

3296
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:57,630
MARISHA: Over the
lava like this direction.

3297
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:59,300
SAM: She's got some cantrips.

3298
02:08:59,330 --> 02:09:01,060
MARISHA: Geez, I can't tell.

3299
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:03,080
-MATT: Which way?
-MARISHA: This way, this way.

3300
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:05,120
See the laser pointer?
No, no, no, I had it.

3301
02:09:05,150 --> 02:09:06,780
I had it and
it went away.

3302
02:09:06,810 --> 02:09:08,720
-Okay.
-MATT: Over here?

3303
02:09:08,750 --> 02:09:10,570
MARISHA: No, it's--
yeah, over there.

3304
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:13,180
-MATT: Over here?
-MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3305
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:15,450
And how far away is
Raishan from me now?

3306
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,810
MATT: I'd say roughly
30 feet, 35 feet.

3307
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:20,530
MARISHA: Okay, move
me like one more closer to her.

3308
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:21,750
MATT: There you go.

3309
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:24,750
MARISHA: And how close am I 
from the twins now?

3310
02:09:24,750 --> 02:09:26,180
I can't see.

3311
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:28,120
MATT: Twins, you're about 30,
another 35 feet from them.

3312
02:09:28,150 --> 02:09:29,660
MARISHA: Okay, let me move
five more feet

3313
02:09:29,690 --> 02:09:31,180
so I can be within
30 feet of the twins.

3314
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:32,480
MATT: Okay.

3315
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:34,060
MARISHA: Okay, now I'm
gonna drop my--

3316
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:36,180
MATT: Well, with both twins,
you'd have to move there.

3317
02:09:36,210 --> 02:09:37,210
You drop your form?

3318
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,660
-MARISHA: Drop my form.
-MATT: Alright.

3319
02:09:38,690 --> 02:09:40,060
MARISHA: I hope this is not
a terrible idea.

3320
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:41,810
-MATT: I'll put you there.
-TALIESIN: We're at that point.

3321
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,630
MARISHA: We're at that point.

3322
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:45,720
This is Dungeons
and Dragons!

3323
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:49,150
TALIESIN: This is dungeon
and dragons.

3324
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:53,540
MARISHA: I'm going to bust out
the Spire of Conflux.

3325
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:58,810
So I'm gonna bust out the staff
and be like, "You bitch."

3326
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,150
And then aim it.

3327
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:03,450
I'm gonna do chain lightning

3328
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:07,120
and can I try and
hit her and the two eggs

3329
02:10:07,150 --> 02:10:09,630
and maybe like, since
I still have the storm going,

3330
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:11,540
like, it just looks cool?

3331
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:14,540
(laughing)

3332
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:16,300
MATT: Sure.

3333
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:18,480
LAURA: Doesn't it--?

3334
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:20,360
MATT: Raishan saves.

3335
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:22,270
The eggs cannot
save technically,

3336
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:23,810
so go ahead
and roll damage.

3337
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:26,210
LAURA: Don't you get the
lightning attacks too?

3338
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:27,570
If you're doing
chain lightning,

3339
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:29,570
you still get the other
lightning's that are there?

3340
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:31,870
MARISHA: I have to choose
to make an action.

3341
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,780
It's still there,

3342
02:10:33,810 --> 02:10:36,660
but I can either like do other
things or choose to do--

3343
02:10:36,660 --> 02:10:38,150
LAURA: I understand.

3344
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:45,180
MARISHA: Sorry, I don't
do the-- 10d8.

3345
02:10:45,210 --> 02:10:47,230
TALIESIN: Do you need some d8's?

3346
02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:49,200
MARISHA: I have one, two,
three, four, five...

3347
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:50,850
I think I'm good,
I'll just roll five twice.

3348
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:52,540
Oh, God, oh, God.

3349
02:10:52,570 --> 02:10:53,720
Did she save?

3350
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:55,480
MATT: Yes, she did.

3351
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:56,870
MARISHA: But the eggs didn't?

3352
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:58,060
MATT: The eggs did not.

3353
02:10:58,090 --> 02:11:01,420
MARISHA: Okay, that's not
phenomenal.

3354
02:11:01,450 --> 02:11:05,300
Three, six, nine,
ten-- nine, ten, eleven.

3355
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:09,180
Plus four is 15 plus...

3356
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:12,990
Okay, okay.

3357
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:16,300
What'd I say, 15?

3358
02:11:16,330 --> 02:11:18,970
Twenty-five, 29.

3359
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:21,660
Thirty-six total.

3360
02:11:21,690 --> 02:11:23,330
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3361
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:25,060
MARISHA: Oh!

3362
02:11:25,090 --> 02:11:26,690
Oh, and I get to
reroll this one.

3363
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:29,000
Thirty-six, no,
thirty-eight.

3364
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:33,270
MATT: Thirty-eight, okay.

3365
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:37,840
That would be 29,
no, sorry.

3366
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:40,390
No, from 30, 19.

3367
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:42,720
Nineteen damage to Raishan
and the two eggs--

3368
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:44,510
You watch as the bolt hits,

3369
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:47,290
arcs through her,
arcs through the eggs.

3370
02:11:47,290 --> 02:11:49,330
You see the eggs still
carrying them, no visual.

3371
02:11:49,330 --> 02:11:51,180
MARISHA: It didn't do
anything to 'em?

3372
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:52,830
MATT: Well, nothing
you can see, no.

3373
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:54,480
MARISHA: Nothing I can see.

3374
02:11:54,510 --> 02:11:56,300
Maybe I like
microwaved 'em inside.

3375
02:11:56,330 --> 02:11:57,390
Like nuked 'em.

3376
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:59,270
Might have nuked 'em.

3377
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:02,030
TRAVIS: Might have been like Vision
and you made 'em super strong.

3378
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:04,620
MARISHA: Yeah, or I turned 'em into
little Vision dragons.

3379
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:06,390
You know,
one of the two.

3380
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,600
Okay, and then
for my bonus action,

3381
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:12,030
I'm going to do a
Healing Word on Vax.

3382
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:13,100
MATT: Okay.

3383
02:12:16,030 --> 02:12:20,660
MARISHA: I'm just gonna
do it at first level.

3384
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:22,780
-Sorry.
-LIAM: No, hey.

3385
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:24,240
TALIESIN: It's back up.

3386
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:29,270
MARISHA: Three plus (indistinguishable)
so nine total.

3387
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:31,780
LIAM: Thank you.

3388
02:12:31,810 --> 02:12:34,080
MATT: At the end of your turn,

3389
02:12:36,270 --> 02:12:38,540
watching you form over,
hit her with lightning,

3390
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:41,510
hit the eggs
and all of a sudden,

3391
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:45,360
breath come back to the
lungs of Vax on the ground.

3392
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:48,020
Raishan, "Not so fast."

3393
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:49,360
Still clutching the eggs,

3394
02:12:49,390 --> 02:12:52,480
her front claws kind
of form this small spiral

3395
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:54,840
as the air grows
surprisingly cold

3396
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:57,660
causing this mist to form

3397
02:12:57,690 --> 02:13:00,780
around the extended
ends of her claws.

3398
02:13:00,810 --> 02:13:04,210
As she puts
her arms forth,

3399
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:06,600
casting Cone of Cold
outward from her.

3400
02:13:06,630 --> 02:13:10,180
LAURA: I wonder if they're elemental,
like, amplifiers.

3401
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:11,240
MARISHA: The eggs?

3402
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:13,090
TALIESIN: I think, I think
maybe they're--

3403
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:14,570
TRAVIS: Just eggs?

3404
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:17,300
TALIESIN: No, no, I think she
may be on to something.

3405
02:13:17,330 --> 02:13:19,510
MATT: That's going to be...

3406
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:21,120
I don't know if
it's going to hit.

3407
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:22,210
TALIESIN: No, no.

3408
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:23,840
MATT: Does not hit Gilmore.

3409
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:25,510
However, I need Scanlan...

3410
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:28,750
SAM: Would I be able to
counter spell this or--

3411
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:32,780
or am I already in a cloud
of smoke and coughing?

3412
02:13:32,810 --> 02:13:36,330
MATT: Oh, you can't
technically move

3413
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:38,090
cause you're
doubled over.

3414
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:39,630
SAM: I'm already in
the cloud, right?

3415
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:41,030
-MATT: Yeah.
-SAM: Okay.

3416
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:43,780
LAURA: You're in the cloud,
but you can be restored.

3417
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:45,220
Cause you've
been backed up.

3418
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:46,110
SAM: Oh. Backblaze?

3419
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:48,180
SAM: You're slowly becoming 
me tonight.

3420
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:49,820
TALIESIN: Can Gilmore
dispel or--

3421
02:13:50,750 --> 02:13:53,330
Just throwing
that out there.

3422
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,700
I know you're
playing a lot of hands here.

3423
02:13:56,690 --> 02:13:59,560
SAM: You're so handsome and
charming all of a sudden.

3424
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:03,840
MATT: What's the range on that?

3425
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:09,360
Unfortunately, Gilmore's
just out of range. 60 foot range.

3426
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:11,970
TALIESIN: Goddammit, okay.

3427
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:13,660
MATT: Good looking out though.

3428
02:14:13,690 --> 02:14:15,180
TALIESIN: I'm trying.

3429
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:18,000
MATT: So that is Kima,
Pike, J'Mon,

3430
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:20,210
Scanlan, Vax and Vex

3431
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:22,570
all making constitution
saving throws.

3432
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:23,840
LAURA: I'm unconscious.

3433
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:26,050
MATT: So, you take
another death save.

3434
02:14:26,050 --> 02:14:27,780
-LAURA: Cool.
-TALIESIN: Goddammit.

3435
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:29,660
We need to fix that.

3436
02:14:29,690 --> 02:14:32,870
LAURA: I've got one save left.

3437
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,750
TALIESIN: Please, we got
to fix that.

3438
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:40,300
SAM: Did I-- wait.

3439
02:14:40,330 --> 02:14:44,260
Vax-y poo, did I give
you my cold armor?

3440
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:45,530
I mean, Vex-y poo.

3441
02:14:45,530 --> 02:14:47,770
LAURA: Yeah, you did,
but it's not attuned.

3442
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:49,810
SAM: You're not
even using it?

3443
02:14:49,810 --> 02:14:52,060
MATT: And even then, even at half
damage, she's unconscious.

3444
02:14:52,090 --> 02:14:54,450
LAURA: Well, I am, I'm
just not getting cold--

3445
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,870
MATT: So you're at two
death saves on impact.

3446
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,150
You're unconscious
again to zero.

3447
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:02,450
-You take...
-SAM: I rolled an 11.

3448
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:03,840
MATT: An eleven, yeah.

3449
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:06,690
So you take 43 points of cold damage.

3450
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,180
SAM: I'm so dead.

3451
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:09,330
TRAVIS: No, no, unconscious.

3452
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:10,750
-MATT: Unconscious.
-LAURA: You're unconscious.

3453
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:12,030
SAM: Negative 41.

3454
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:13,180
MATT: Both roll for Pike.

3455
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:15,630
LAURA: It doesn't matter
what you're negative.

3456
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:16,660
TRAVIS: Unless it's your
total hit points.

3457
02:15:16,690 --> 02:15:17,690
LAURA: Yeah.

3458
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:19,120
MATT: Roll for Pike if
you could please.

3459
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:20,690
LAURA: Well,
I wouldn't count it,

3460
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:22,420
but yeah, that was--
that was bad.

3461
02:15:22,450 --> 02:15:23,510
It was better when I--

3462
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:26,570
TALIESIN: Well, not anymore.

3463
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:28,120
LAURA: What is this,
what is this?

3464
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:30,240
Constitution,
what is this?

3465
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:31,660
Five!

3466
02:15:31,690 --> 02:15:33,060
Cause I suck.

3467
02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:35,030
MATT: Pike takes another
43 points of cold damage.

3468
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:36,810
LAURA: Pike is unconscious.

3469
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:38,420
SAM: The gnomes are down.

3470
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:40,240
Well, at least
we got Kima.

3471
02:15:40,270 --> 02:15:41,480
LAURA: Whoa.

3472
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:44,510
The two-- the twins
and the gnomes are out.

3473
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:46,570
SAM: Yeah, whoa,
we're down four?

3474
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:47,930
TALIESIN: We're down four.

3475
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:50,870
-SAM: Whoa!
-LAURA: This is serious, you guys.

3476
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,030
SAM: Don't worry, Devo'ssa's here

3477
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:57,150
to give one shot of
28 points of damage.

3478
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:59,270
Come on, Devo'ssa,
do something!

3479
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,890
TRAVIS: I would hit the dragon
cause it's low enough,

3480
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:03,910
but it's on the
other side of the map.

3481
02:16:04,570 --> 02:16:07,580
MATT: Alrighty, so that's the
end of Keyleth's turn.

3482
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:10,270
It's now Gilmore's turn.

3483
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:14,540
TRAVIS: Come on, Gilmore.

3484
02:16:14,570 --> 02:16:17,390
LAURA: Do you have
Mass Cure, Gilmore?

3485
02:16:17,390 --> 02:16:19,600
MATT: Gilmore does not
cure, unfortunately,

3486
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:22,300
that's not
his specialty.

3487
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:23,960
TRAVIS: What about Razzle Dazzle?

3488
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,730
MATT: He's used a
lot of his spells.

3489
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:29,970
(sighs)

3490
02:16:31,021 --> 02:16:32,300
TALIESIN: I have nothing.

3491
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:33,570
TRAVIS: Can he cast like--

3492
02:16:33,570 --> 02:16:35,660
SAM: Oh, wait!

3493
02:16:35,690 --> 02:16:36,780
Shit.

3494
02:16:36,809 --> 02:16:38,520
No, that was poison.

3495
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:40,660
He shot-- Raishan shot
poison at us, right?

3496
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:41,660
TALIESIN: No, cold.

3497
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:43,209
LAURA: Cold the last time.

3498
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:44,360
SAM: No, the cold this time.

3499
02:16:44,389 --> 02:16:45,990
The previous time
it was poison.

3500
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:47,240
MATT: Yes.

3501
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:48,570
SAM: Never acid though.

3502
02:16:48,570 --> 02:16:50,299
TALIESIN: No, never acid.

3503
02:16:50,330 --> 02:16:52,000
MATT: Gilmore rushes around J'Mon

3504
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:53,659
almost as a
defensive stand point,

3505
02:16:53,659 --> 02:16:55,810
but also kind of taking
in the circumstance.

3506
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:57,870
Watching this blast of
cold air come through.

3507
02:16:57,870 --> 02:17:00,330
Kind of looks around, seeing
everyone on the ground.

3508
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:02,360
It's like,
"Oh God, oh God."

3509
02:17:02,389 --> 02:17:05,870
And in a fit of rage and
needing to lock this down,

3510
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,240
just gonna go ahead with what
he has left at his disposal

3511
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:11,719
to release a...

3512
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:18,309
All he can really do
is a lightning bolt.

3513
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:21,090
Which Raishan rolls a one.

3514
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,629
LAURA: Oh, good, good.

3515
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:24,900
MATT: Uses legendary resistance
to resist it.

3516
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:29,760
LAURA: I have to pee so bad,
I got to get up.

3517
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:32,090
-SAM: How do you want to do this?
-MATT: I know.

3518
02:17:32,090 --> 02:17:33,950
Ten points of lightning
damage to Raishan.

3519
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:35,600
LAURA: What I'm scared of is that

3520
02:17:35,629 --> 02:17:37,660
I'm gonna be away from the
table when I actually die,

3521
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:38,660
but I have to pee.

3522
02:17:38,690 --> 02:17:40,330
MATT: Go pee, it's fine.

3523
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:42,629
LAURA: Just don't kill me while I'm
not at the table, okay, Matt?

3524
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:44,150
MATT: Do my best.

3525
02:17:46,528 --> 02:17:48,849
SAM: Hey, when she gets back
let's all be crying.

3526
02:17:48,849 --> 02:17:50,920
LAURA: (offscreen) Don't-- I heard that!

3527
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,420
(laughter)

3528
02:17:58,389 --> 02:18:00,170
TALIESIN: You are the worst person.

3529
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:04,360
Two seconds longer.

3530
02:18:04,389 --> 02:18:05,840
-MATT: Grog.
-TRAVIS: Yeah.

3531
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:07,780
MATT: Actually, no, oh,
thank you so much.

3532
02:18:07,809 --> 02:18:08,809
TALIESIN: Oh, yay.

3533
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:10,810
MATT: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

3534
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,570
Beautiful.

3535
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:12,840
They found my base.

3536
02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:15,650
TALIESIN: Wow, look at all those
minis that are flattened.

02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:29,200
MARISHA: Kaiju battle!

3693
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,000
LIAM: Take your earrings off,
come on.

3694
02:24:31,030 --> 02:24:33,270
MATT: Rushes up and--

3695
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:35,570
Goes right up into
Raishan's space.

3696
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:36,630
LAURA: Yes!

3697
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:38,150
SAM: Dragon on dragon.

3698
02:24:38,180 --> 02:24:39,750
LAURA: He has a base now?

3699
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:40,780
When did that happen?

3700
02:24:40,810 --> 02:24:42,240
-TRAVIS: While you were peeing.
-LAURA: That's great.

3701
02:24:42,270 --> 02:24:44,000
MATT: So, just rushes up
into Raishan.

3702
02:24:44,030 --> 02:24:46,060
You feel the wind
kind of blast past

3703
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:49,600
as the wings of
J'Mon Sa Ord, Devo'ssa,

3704
02:24:49,630 --> 02:24:53,270
pick them up and they rush
around strafing the side

3705
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:56,920
of Raishan and unleash a
barrage of attacks against her.

3706
02:24:58,150 --> 02:25:00,360
That will be--

3707
02:25:00,390 --> 02:25:03,210
First one is 16, no.

3708
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:04,530
Bite misses.

3709
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,840
Three and a
two, really?

3710
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:11,510
LAURA: Really?

3711
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:12,710
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no.

3712
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:14,350

-TRAVIS: I don't believe it.

-TRAVIS: I don't believe.

3714

look at all the notes.

3715
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:19,090
TRAVIS: I don't believe it!

3716
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:20,360
MATT: Three, two and one.

3717
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:21,860
That is ridiculous.

3718
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:23,720
LAURA: You know why
this happened?

3719
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:25,260
Cause you took
so long to call--

3720
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:26,870
SAM: Yeah, I know, I know.

3721
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,180
They got--
they got bored

3722
02:25:28,210 --> 02:25:32,240
waiting at home and yeah.

3723
02:25:32,270 --> 02:25:35,270
-MATT: So.
-SAM: It's me, it's on me.

3724
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:37,330
MATT: As J'Mon rushes up
and unleashes, Raishan,

3725
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:41,090
who is slippery
at best, and really,

3726
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:44,240
really, really creepily
deceitful at her worst,

3727
02:25:44,270 --> 02:25:46,030
dodges to the side,
so, she's in the shadows

3728
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:48,390
and the cloud of
the storm in the air

3729
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:50,390
to kind of hide her form

3730
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:54,570
as J'Mon reaches out
and starts slashing Raishan,

3731
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:57,060
who's now has this kind
of wild look in her eyes

3732
02:25:57,090 --> 02:25:58,720
of now mounting victory.

3733
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:00,660
From a moment
of fear earlier,

3734
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:02,720
she manages to avoid
the first two strikes

3735
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:04,270
and the third one,

3736
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:06,540
the tail slaps against
the side of Raishan's body.

3737
02:26:06,570 --> 02:26:08,210
Whack and smacks
to no effect.

3738
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:10,180
TRAVIS: Jesus.

3739
02:26:10,210 --> 02:26:12,390
MATT: That ends
J'Mon's turn.

3740
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:13,570
It is now
Pike's turn.

3741
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:14,690
LIAM: Pike, how close
is she to--

3742
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:17,300
-SAM: Book!
-TALIESIN: Book?

3743
02:26:17,330 --> 02:26:20,810
MATT: Pike is about
25 feet away.

3744
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:22,600
LIAM: She's gonna run
up, kneel down,

3745
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:25,810
wait, kiss Vex on
the forehead, and say,

3746
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,240
"Not like this, buddy,"

3747
02:26:27,270 --> 02:26:31,000
and cast Revivify
for her last spell.

3748
02:26:31,030 --> 02:26:32,690
TRAVIS: It is her last.

3749
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:34,330
MATT: Revivify is touch

3750
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:37,060
and she's coming up
from unconscious prone

3751
02:26:37,090 --> 02:26:38,180
which means she
doesn't have the movement

3752
02:26:38,210 --> 02:26:39,270
to get there to touch her.

3753
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:40,480
LIAM: Pike is unconscious?

3754
02:26:40,510 --> 02:26:41,870
MATT: Oh, no, she was--
she was--

3755
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:42,870
TRAVIS: Pike was not
unconscious.

3756
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,210
MARISHA: She was not
unconscious, she was up.

3757
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:45,630
TRAVIS: She was up
with 15--

3758
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,510
MATT: Oh, oh.

3759
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:49,210
LAURA: She had 15.

3760
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:50,870
-But she was--
-SAM: She was lying down.

3761
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,210
-LAURA: She was lying on--
-MATT: So, she was prone.

3762
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,450
She was prone.

3763
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:55,090
TRAVIS: Oh, why didn't I
just pick her up?

3764
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:56,390
MATT: No, so she can move.

3765
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:58,270
She can't get there.

3766
02:26:58,300 --> 02:26:59,270
LAURA: That's okay.

3767
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:02,510
MATT: It's a touch spell.

3768
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:04,630
LIAM: Who's she near?

3769
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:06,660
MARISHA: How much time does
Revivify need?

3770
02:27:06,690 --> 02:27:07,660
LAURA: A minute.

3771
02:27:07,690 --> 02:27:09,570
TALIESIN: Oh, under
a minute.

3772
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:11,570
Oh, well, she
can make her way--

3773
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:13,360
LAURA: She's got
Sprinter's Boots on!

3774
02:27:13,390 --> 02:27:15,810
She just texted.

3775
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,510
MATT: Had she used
them recently?

3776
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:19,270
LAURA: We didn't use them
in the last fight

3777
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:20,720
because we didn't
realize she had 'em.

3778
02:27:20,750 --> 02:27:22,480
MATT: The internet
will let us know.

3779
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:24,490
LAURA: Well, I-- we didn't use 'em
in the fight with Thordak.

3780
02:27:24,490 --> 02:27:26,150
LIAM: She didn't know she had
'em so we didn't use 'em.

3781
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,270
MATT: Right, right, so.

3782
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:29,240
SAM: Do you have any
other healing spells

3783
02:27:29,270 --> 02:27:30,480
that can work
at a distance?

3784
02:27:30,510 --> 02:27:32,090
-LIAM: She's dead.
-MARISHA: She's dead.

3785
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:33,120
She's gonna
do Revivify.

3786

-LAURA: For Pike, though.
-TALIESIN: Yeah, like.

3787
02:27:35,090 --> 02:27:36,810
LIAM: So the Sprinter's Boots do
nothing, I mean, I don't know.

3788
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:38,300
MATT: The Sprinter's Boots will
let her double her movement

3789
02:27:38,330 --> 02:27:39,510
for a round.

3790
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:41,360
LIAM: So will she get there?

"Sprinter's Boots!"

SAM: How long does
it take to cast?

3798
02:28:02,210 --> 02:28:04,030
LIAM: It's instantaneous.

3799
02:28:04,060 --> 02:28:05,420
TALIESIN: Less than six seconds.

3800

instantaneous.

3801

less than six seconds, man.

MATT: So, but this is
only from Pike

3806
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:24,380
because it is
a singular roll.

that just radiates

02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:22,450
LAURA: She's got a--
she's got a Greater healing--

3846
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:25,730
Pike has a Greater healing
potion that I know of.

3847
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
So she can take it.

3848
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,120
MATT: Okay.

3849
02:30:29,150 --> 02:30:31,300
So that is a
4d4 plus four.

3850
02:30:31,330 --> 02:30:32,450
TRAVIS: This sucks!

3851
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:33,690
TALIESIN: I'm almost
of the thinking

3852
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:35,150
that she shouldn't
take it just because--

3853
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:37,380
-Well, no, she's got--
-LAURA: She's got 15 points.

3854
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:39,120
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, but
anything hits her--

3855
02:30:39,150 --> 02:30:41,040
half the things that hit her
are gonna even kill that

3856
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:42,510
and that's a
revive from death.

3857
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:43,600
LAURA: That's true.

3858
02:30:43,630 --> 02:30:46,540
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's
on her, right?

3859
02:30:46,570 --> 02:30:48,360
Yeah, I see what
you mean though.

3860
02:30:48,390 --> 02:30:49,660
LAURA: Should she wait,
should she hold it?

3861
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:51,340
SAM: They're in control of her.

3862
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:53,140
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do it,
you do it, you do it.

3863
02:30:53,140 --> 02:30:55,300
I'm overthinking this.

3864
02:30:55,330 --> 02:30:57,120
LIAM: Yeah, we're talking about
getting people back up.

3865
02:30:57,150 --> 02:31:00,390
At this point, not healing
cause any hit is lethal.

3866
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:02,000
So getting someone
on their feet.

3867
02:31:02,030 --> 02:31:04,540
TRAVIS: I got some potions
cause I never use 'em, but...

3868
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:06,630
MATT: Yeah, you guys have been
hording potions for a while.

3869
02:31:06,660 --> 02:31:08,750
You've been burning
through all of them

3870
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:10,390
from these
two encounters.

3871
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:12,150
TRAVIS: I've got all the
ones I've never used.

3872
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:13,600
LIAM: Who's on the
ground by Grog?

3873
02:31:13,630 --> 02:31:14,690
TALIESIN: You.

3874
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,210
LIAM: No, I know I am, but
who else is that?

3875
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:18,660
TALIESIN: It's Scanlan, Scanlan's
on the ground still.

3876
02:31:18,690 --> 02:31:21,690
LIAM: Is someone up besides me?

3877
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:23,540
LAURA: Well, I want-- it's
an action if she--

3878
02:31:23,570 --> 02:31:25,030
if she gives it
to anybody else.

3879
02:31:25,060 --> 02:31:27,330
She can't, she can only take it
as a bonus action for herself.

3880
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:31,120
-TRAVIS: Go.
-LIAM: Go.

3881
02:31:31,150 --> 02:31:33,840
LAURA: Oh, that's really
good though.

3882
02:31:33,870 --> 02:31:36,510
MARISHA: I wonder how bad
Raishan is looking.

3883
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:38,330
TALIESIN: He hasn't said the phrase.

3884
02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:40,600
-LAURA: Nineteen.
-MATT: Okay, nice.

3885
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:44,840
Alright, at the end of Pike's
turn, Devo'ssa, J'Mon Sa Ord,

3886
02:31:44,870 --> 02:31:46,270
is gonna use two
legendary actions

3887
02:31:46,300 --> 02:31:47,630
to attempt a
wing attack.

3888
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:48,720
TALIESIN: Thank God.

3889
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:50,180
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

3890
02:31:50,210 --> 02:31:52,750
MATT: He is now like just
assailing Raishan

3891
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:56,000
with their wings.

3892
02:31:56,030 --> 02:32:00,510
So, Raishan has to make a
dexterity saving throw.

3893
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:03,570
That is cocked, try again.

3894
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:05,840
No, that is a failure.

3895
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:08,540
Raishan's gonna use the
last legendary resistance

3896
02:32:08,570 --> 02:32:09,780
to resist that.

3897
02:32:09,810 --> 02:32:11,780
So instead takes...

3898
02:32:11,810 --> 02:32:15,540
TRAVIS: Fuck!

3899
02:32:15,570 --> 02:32:17,150
MATT: That's...

3900
02:32:17,180 --> 02:32:19,330
MARISHA: She's burned through all
of her legendary resistance?

3901
02:32:19,360 --> 02:32:22,420
MATT: Seven points of bludgeoning
damage and is not knocked prone.

3902
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:24,540
That would have
messed her up.

3903
02:32:24,570 --> 02:32:25,660
Okay.

3904
02:32:25,690 --> 02:32:27,180
TRAVIS: Is not knocked prone?

3905
02:32:27,210 --> 02:32:28,810
MATT: No, she is not,
she's safe.

3906
02:32:28,840 --> 02:32:32,180
Okay, that brings
us to Scanlan.

3907
02:32:32,210 --> 02:32:35,420
LAURA: We just gotta
get out of here.

3908
02:32:35,450 --> 02:32:37,330
SAM: Fail.

3909
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:40,390
MATT: That's a death
saving throw off Scanlan.

3910
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:42,390
Alrighty, that brings us
to the top of the round.

3911
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:45,850
Percy, you are in
the back of a wall.

3912
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,600
TALIESIN: I'm taking...

3913
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:53,240
MATT: The curse of the unscathed!

3914
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:56,340
TALIESIN: You know, I was gonna take shots
at the eggs, but I give up.

3915
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:58,420
I'm taking just
shots at Raishan.

3916
02:32:58,450 --> 02:33:00,390
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3917
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:01,570
TALIESIN: Come on.

3918
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:03,090
Don't be stupid.

3919
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:04,780
-That's stupid.
-MARISHA: Pretty stupid.

3920
02:33:04,810 --> 02:33:06,450
LAURA: Oh my God,
we're all gonna--

3921
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:08,000
I'm not gonna say it.

3922
02:33:08,030 --> 02:33:09,060
-We're gonna--
-TRAVIS: Don't you-- shh!

3923
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:10,150
LAURA: We're gonna get
through this, you guys.

3924
02:33:10,180 --> 02:33:11,150
We're all gonna
get through this.

3925
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:12,570
TRAVIS: ♪ I gotta get through this ♪

3926
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:14,240
♪ I gotta get
through this ♪

3927
02:33:14,270 --> 02:33:16,330
♪ I gotta get ♪♪

3928
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:19,480
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I've got--
that's a-- that's a--

3929
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:21,330
-That's a gun jam.
-MARISHA: Fuck.

3930
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:22,720
-MATT: Really?
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

3931
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:23,750
-LAURA: Fuck.
-TALIESIN: Hold on.

3932
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:25,420
LAURA: Oh my God.

3933
02:33:25,450 --> 02:33:27,840
TALIESIN: That's a
bad gun jam.

3934
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:30,180
I'm talking bad,
they're both bad gun jams.

3935
02:33:30,210 --> 02:33:32,090
Alright, I've got
one weapon left

3936
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:33,510
that can just barely make it,

3937
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:35,810
so I'm just
screaming to the world.

3938
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:37,480
Here we go.

3939
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:38,690
MATT: So you're pulling
out Retort.

3940
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:40,780
TALIESIN: Yeah, Retort is out
and that's a 23.

3941
02:33:40,810 --> 02:33:42,540
MATT: That hits.

3942
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:46,050
Two more attacks on that, right?

3943
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:50,660
TALIESIN: Only one more because I took
an attack with Bad News.

3944
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:54,450
MATT: That's-- well, Bad News
takes an attack to reload.

3945
02:33:54,480 --> 02:33:57,180
TALIESIN: But-- no, the
first shot went--

3946
02:33:57,210 --> 02:33:59,360
MATT: Right, but usually,
it's action.

3947
02:33:59,390 --> 02:34:03,450
TALIESIN: Right, so I have two more-- I
have two attacks with Retort.

3948
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:05,880
-So, that's--
-MATT: That hits.

3949
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:09,300
TALIESIN: That's um, oh,
that's nice.

3950
02:34:09,330 --> 02:34:10,570
Fourteen points of damage.

3951
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:11,760
MATT: Okay.

3952
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:16,130
TALIESIN: And...

3953
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:22,510
Oh, that was so mean, that
was almost a natural 20.

3954
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:24,920
-Twenty-four.
-MATT: That hits.

3955
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:29,390
TALIESIN: Ah, 16 points of damage.

3956
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:30,750
-MATT: Nice.
-TRAVIS: Nice.

3957
02:34:30,780 --> 02:34:33,260
MATT: Let me take some
concentration checks on that.

3958
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:35,330
Yep and yeah.

3959
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:37,600
TALIESIN: And I'm going to reload,

3960
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:38,960
and I'm going to

3961
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:43,090
start running
across the wall

3962
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:45,510
away from the fray.

3963
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:46,750
MATT: Around this way?

3964
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:48,000
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3965
02:34:48,030 --> 02:34:49,120
MATT: So, you get about there.

3966
02:34:49,150 --> 02:34:50,720
TALIESIN: That far.

3967
02:34:50,750 --> 02:34:52,130
Getting out of the way.

3968
02:34:52,130 --> 02:34:53,540
MATT: Okay.

3969
02:34:53,570 --> 02:34:55,360
That ends your turn.

3970
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:57,270
It is now back
to a lair action.

3971
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:59,160
-SAM: Great.
-TRAVIS: Fuck.

3972
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:02,450
MATT: The ground in the
center here quakes

3973
02:35:02,480 --> 02:35:07,000
and cracks open as a
familiar burst of magma--

3974
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:09,280
-Everyone in this vicinity.
-LAURA: Goddammit.

3975
02:35:11,060 --> 02:35:15,330
MATT: I need Vex.

3976
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:17,750
Vax, you're--

3977
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:21,150
LIAM: Well, I gotta go,
I've got one success.

3978
02:35:21,180 --> 02:35:23,240
MATT: Right, but you're still
unconscious, right?

3979
02:35:23,270 --> 02:35:24,570
LIAM: Yeah.

3980
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:27,090
MATT: So, you just take-- you just
lose a death saving throw.

3981
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:30,450
As the magma bursts and sprays
around, so you take one.

3982
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:32,480
I need you to make
a dexterity save.

3983
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:35,000
-I need Scanlan--
-SAM: I lose another death save.

3984
02:35:35,030 --> 02:35:37,690
-MATT: You lose another.
-LAURA: You got one left, Scanlan?

3985
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:39,090
MATT: I need Pike to make

3986
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:42,840
a dexterity saving throw.

3987
02:35:42,870 --> 02:35:44,060
TRAVIS: Me too, right?

3988
02:35:44,090 --> 02:35:45,180
MATT: And you too, Grog.

3989
02:35:45,210 --> 02:35:46,420
SAM: He's got high dex, right?

3990
02:35:46,450 --> 02:35:47,420
Right?

3991
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:49,240
LAURA: Well, this, you know what?

3992
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:51,390
MATT: Gilmore does not make it.

3993
02:35:51,390 --> 02:35:53,240
TRAVIS: That's not bad.

3994
02:35:53,270 --> 02:35:56,210
MATT: I'm rolling shit
for damage, that's good.

3995
02:35:56,240 --> 02:35:57,590
Wow.

3996
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,480
SAM: What'd you roll, Laurs?

3997
02:36:00,510 --> 02:36:02,180
LAURA: I rolled an
eight for Pike.

3998
02:36:02,210 --> 02:36:03,180
MATT: Okay, so--

3999
02:36:03,210 --> 02:36:04,720
LAURA: And a one for me.

4000
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:07,540
MATT: Okay, ten points of fire
damage to each of you halved,

4001
02:36:07,570 --> 02:36:08,870
so you both take five.

4002
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,480
LAURA: Okay, I'm unconscious.

4003
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:12,630
MATT: Okay.

4004
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:16,000
LAURA: This is so fun, you guys,
I love this fight.

4005
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,650
SAM: Let's go-- oh.

4006
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:20,150
LAURA: Pike's at 29.

4007
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:22,540
TRAVIS: I rolled a 19.

4008
02:36:22,570 --> 02:36:24,450
MATT: A 19, okay, you succeed,
so you take half damage.

4009
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:27,390
So you take five, but you're
resistant from the potion,

4010
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:28,720
so half that, so two.

4011
02:36:28,750 --> 02:36:30,090
Two points
of fire damage.

4012
02:36:30,090 --> 02:36:31,060
TRAVIS: Okay.

4013
02:36:32,150 --> 02:36:33,600
MATT: Alrighty.

4014
02:36:33,630 --> 02:36:35,580
It is now Raishan's turn.

4015
02:36:37,190 --> 02:36:38,410
MARISHA: So not good.

4016
02:36:38,410 --> 02:36:40,660
TRAVIS: I just want to go
flip the table over.

4017
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:42,150
MATT: Hasted.

4018
02:36:42,180 --> 02:36:44,450
Raishan, by the way, from
the attack from Percy,

4019
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:47,060
the damage, you can see Raishan
is now visibly bleeding.

4020
02:36:47,090 --> 02:36:48,880
Parts of the
scales are torn.

4021
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:51,500
You can see now, at a
close up vantage point,

4022
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,630
as much as the previous
dragons you've battled

4023
02:36:55,660 --> 02:36:58,540
have had a lot
of resilience,

4024
02:36:58,570 --> 02:37:00,630
Raishan's taken a
fair amount of damage,

4025
02:37:00,660 --> 02:37:03,330
but seems to not be
quite as physically hearty

4026
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:05,180
as what you
previously faced

4027
02:37:05,210 --> 02:37:08,630
and is looking
visibly hurt.

4028
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:11,870
Raishan is going
to begin the round,

4029
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,030
turning to
the rest of you.

4030
02:37:14,060 --> 02:37:18,840
"I have business elsewhere, and
you're being really obnoxious.

4031
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:21,610
Stay down."

4032
02:37:22,300 --> 02:37:24,630
And glancing over
is going to go ahead

4033
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:28,720
and with both of her hands,
again, release another...

4034
02:37:28,750 --> 02:37:31,090
She is almost
out of spells.

4035
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,840
Cone of Cold.

4036
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:36,670
LAURA: Oh no, this is
gonna be Scanlan.

4037
02:37:37,910 --> 02:37:39,000
MARISHA: Fuck.

4038
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:42,000
MATT: That is-- I need--

4039
02:37:42,030 --> 02:37:44,670
-So, Scanlan--
-TRAVIS: No!

4040
02:37:45,330 --> 02:37:47,450
-MATT: Scanlan is...
-TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

4041
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:51,660
MATT: Frozen, covered
in ice, locked in place.

4042
02:37:51,690 --> 02:37:54,960
A solid gnome
bereft of life.

4043
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:56,240
Motionless
on the ground.

4044
02:37:56,270 --> 02:37:58,600
SAM: I died as I lived: hard.

4045
02:37:58,630 --> 02:38:01,030
(laughter)

4046
02:38:04,330 --> 02:38:05,580
MATT: Gilmore takes--

4047
02:38:05,580 --> 02:38:07,790
TRAVIS: I heard him say
that before he died.

4048
02:38:07,790 --> 02:38:10,120
MATT: Gilmore loses a
death saving throw.

4049
02:38:10,150 --> 02:38:12,120
Vax, you take another damage

4050
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:14,210
to your two
failed death saving throws.

4051
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:16,560
Pike needs to make a
constitution saving throw.

4052
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:18,280
Grog, constitution
saving throw.

4053
02:38:19,940 --> 02:38:21,000
LAURA: Was I in there?

4054
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,070
MATT: You were, so you also--

4055
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:26,630
TRAVIS: Twenty-four.

4056
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:28,210
MATT: Twenty-four,
you succeed.

4057
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:29,450
TRAVIS: Plus 10 for
constitution.

4058
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:31,890
-LAURA: That's good.
-TRAVIS: Fourteen.

4059
02:38:33,090 --> 02:38:34,060
MARISHA: Jesus.

4060
02:38:34,090 --> 02:38:36,480
LAURA: Eleven for Pike.

4061
02:38:36,510 --> 02:38:39,390
MATT: Okay, that's 30 points
of cold damage to Pike.

4062
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:41,110
-LAURA: Seriously?
-MATT: Yeah.

4063
02:38:41,110 --> 02:38:42,390
LAURA: She's unconscious.

4064
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:43,570
TALIESIN: Yep.

4065
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:45,840
MATT: Pike is unconscious.

4066
02:38:45,870 --> 02:38:47,030
TALIESIN: That's where we're at.

4067
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:49,020
LAURA: We're-- we're--
I don't know how

4068
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:51,270
we're gonna
get Scanlan back.

4069
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:54,120
TALIESIN: I--I have no--
there's no--

4070
02:38:55,690 --> 02:38:57,510
MARISHA: That'll be a
later question?

4071
02:38:57,540 --> 02:38:58,540
TALIESIN: That may happen.

4072
02:38:58,570 --> 02:38:59,600
MATT: So Pike is down.

4073
02:38:59,630 --> 02:39:02,330
-TALIESIN: You have a plan?
-SAM: I have a plan.

4074
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:05,970
It involves me humping
a lot of angels in heaven.

4075
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:11,110
TALIESIN: Okay.

4076
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:15,870
MATT: Watching this carnage,

4077
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,510
you watch as the spell finalizes
the blast of cold arcane energy

4078
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:23,270
just careening forth
and then fading.

4079
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:26,600
The ground itself, which is
now, normally glowing orange,

4080
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:30,150
is now covered with a
very thin sheet of ice

4081
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:32,840
and you watch steam rise
up from the contrasting heat

4082
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:34,030
and cold
from the spell

4083
02:39:34,060 --> 02:39:35,840
effecting the
surrounding atmosphere.

4084
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:37,600
As the mist dissipates,

4085
02:39:37,630 --> 02:39:40,640
you see a big toothy grin
curl across Raishan's face.

4086
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:43,000
Little bit of dragon blood
curling past her teeth

4087
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:44,810
from the wounds
that she's suffered.

4088
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:47,510
Glaring nervously
over at J'Mon Sa Ord,

4089
02:39:47,540 --> 02:39:49,660
who has taken nearly
no damage at this point

4090
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:52,810
and is currently up
in Raishan's face.

4091
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:57,690
Raishan says, "Well,
I'm afraid I have to get

4092
02:39:57,720 --> 02:40:01,600
to the rest of my day.

4093
02:40:01,630 --> 02:40:04,270
Die amongst your
friends as you should."

4094
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:06,540
And just tears off of J'Mon

4095
02:40:06,570 --> 02:40:09,120
and goes into a
full hasted fly away.

4096
02:40:09,150 --> 02:40:11,240
-SAM: Does J'Mon get--
-LIAM: Attack of opportunity, J'Mon.

4097
02:40:11,270 --> 02:40:12,690
MATT: J'Mon does,
J'Mon is gonna make

4098
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:17,480
a bite attack
against Raishan.

4099
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:19,280
With a natural 20!

4100
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:21,020
-SAM: Does that grapple?
-TRAVIS: Are you serious?

4101
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:23,750
-MARISHA: Does that grapple?
-MATT: It does not grapple.

4102
02:40:23,750 --> 02:40:25,140
But that is...

4103
02:40:27,470 --> 02:40:30,000
MARISHA: She'd have to do a
concentration check, right?

4104
02:40:30,030 --> 02:40:31,510
MATT: She will, yeah.

4105
02:40:31,540 --> 02:40:35,330
That is 18 plus eight.

4106
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:38,390
That's 26 piercing damage plus
she's immune to poison.

4107
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:40,300
She takes no
poison damage.

4108
02:40:40,330 --> 02:40:43,060
That's 28 points of
piercing damage to her.

4109
02:40:43,090 --> 02:40:45,450
TALIESIN: (whimpering)

4110
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:48,570
MATT: Concentration check,
oh, she's fine.

4111
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:51,230
It's ten plus 14,
so, yeah, she's fine.

4112
02:40:52,450 --> 02:40:55,670
So, the haste does not dispel,
however, J'Mon bites out

4113
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:57,870
and takes a huge
chunk of flesh

4114
02:40:57,870 --> 02:40:59,810
as the teeth
just scrape across

4115
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:02,090
the back of Raishan's wing
and shoulder like...

4116
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:03,210
(snarls)

4117
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:06,300
But manages to pull
away and at a full

4118
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:10,060
160 foot flying
speed hasted

4119
02:41:10,090 --> 02:41:12,540
and just disappears
down the hallway.

4120
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:14,120
MARISHA: Should've done that,
should've done it.

4121
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:18,030
MATT: Into the ashes
and shadow behind.

4122
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:19,630
Keyleth, it's your turn.

4123
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:23,450
MARISHA: Okay, she has 120 foot--
or she just went 160 feet?

4124
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:24,690
MATT: A 160 feet, yeah.

Fuck me,
oh my God, okay.

4130
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:48,420
Can I still see her
through the tunnel?

4131
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:51,880
MATT: No, she is outside of
your dark vision view radius

4132
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:54,030
and there is no light
in the tunnel ahead

4133
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:55,540
and it is a
slight incline.

4134
02:41:55,570 --> 02:41:57,270
You just watch her just...

4135
02:41:57,300 --> 02:41:58,870
Disappear into
the dark tunnel.

4136
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,300
Currently have no
bead of sight on her.

4137
02:42:01,330 --> 02:42:03,620
TRAVIS: Smoke the tunnel, dude.

4138

Maybe you get her, 
maybe you don't.

4139
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:08,510
I'm gonna shut up.

4140

MARISHA: It's a range thing.

4141

I mean, could I
try and-- fuck.

02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:35,390
TRAVIS: Don't worry, I'm gonna
take off at a run and--

4150
02:42:35,420 --> 02:42:37,000
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4151
02:42:37,030 --> 02:42:40,810
He can only go
probably half her speed.

4152
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:43,840
TRAVIS: Picture Butterbean
running down an empty street.

4153
02:42:43,870 --> 02:42:46,510
MARISHA: 'Cause my--
my question is--

4154
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:48,420
SAM: Jarret's still up there.

4155
02:42:48,450 --> 02:42:50,060
MARISHA: She didn't necessarily--

4156
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:51,830
LAURA: Just waiting,
crossbow loaded.

4157
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:53,300
TRAVIS: He's just like...

4158
02:42:53,330 --> 02:42:55,150
(whimpers)

4159
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:57,840
MARISHA: 'Cause could I try
and move up

4160
02:42:57,870 --> 02:43:02,090
and then do a long range
Wall of Stone spell?

4161
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:06,600
To try and collapse the
tunnel before she gets out?

4162
02:43:06,630 --> 02:43:08,570
It's 120 foot.

4163
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:10,420
MATT: A 120 foot range?

4164
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:13,000
The spell from where
you are currently,

4165
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:17,510
which is over here,
she went 160 feet

4166
02:43:17,540 --> 02:43:19,360
even further away
from you than she was,

4167
02:43:19,390 --> 02:43:21,240
so she'd be beyond
the distance

4168
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:24,840
of the spell
unfortunately.

4169
02:43:24,870 --> 02:43:26,270
TRAVIS: Cause if you miss,
you trap us.

4170
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:28,090
LAURA: Yeah, and then
we can't get out.

4171
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:29,420
MARISHA: No, I mean, I can't--

4172
02:43:29,450 --> 02:43:31,750
I mean, I could get
us out again, but--

4173
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:33,290
LAURA: A bunch of dead people,

4174
02:43:33,290 --> 02:43:35,630
you could get a bunch
of dead people out?

4175
02:43:35,660 --> 02:43:37,450
MARISHA: I know.

4176
02:43:37,480 --> 02:43:39,740
Okay, wow.

4177
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:42,100
TRAVIS: Indiana Jones and
the Last crusade.

4178
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:43,550
MARISHA: This is really bad.

4179
02:43:43,550 --> 02:43:47,660
Okay, I will use...

4180
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:50,350
LAURA: That wasn't her
last spell, by the way.

4181
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:52,060
She's got three spell slots left.

4182
02:43:52,060 --> 02:43:54,270
MARISHA: Who's-- yeah,
who's really close?

4183
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:55,570
Who's like one away?

4184
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:56,810
Who's like really bad?

4185
02:43:56,840 --> 02:43:58,750
-LAURA: Close to death?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

4186
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:00,570
LAURA: He's closer to
death than me.

4187
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:02,180
LIAM: I'm two failures.

4188
02:44:02,210 --> 02:44:05,120
-SAM: Is Pike down?
-LAURA: Pike's unconscious.

4189
02:44:05,150 --> 02:44:06,810
-TRAVIS: Oh, she is?
-SAM: Get Pike up.

4190
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:09,150
LAURA: I'm one fail,
he's two fails.

4191
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:10,450
Scanlan's dead.

4192
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:12,540
TALIESIN: Who's got healing spells?

4193
02:44:12,570 --> 02:44:14,450
Wake up whoever can heal.

4194
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:16,390
LAURA: I've got Cure Wounds
if I'm awake.

4195
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:17,630
TALIESIN: So, get her up.

4196
02:44:17,660 --> 02:44:20,290
LIAM: I can heal people
if I get up.

4197
02:44:21,110 --> 02:44:22,810
MARISHA: Okay, it doesn't matter.

4198
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:24,570
Can I kinda jump and make

4199
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:28,360
my way over like,
this kind of...

4200
02:44:28,390 --> 02:44:29,750
TALIESIN: Fuck.

4201
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:34,120
MARISHA: This-- can I cross this
tinier lava right there?

4202
02:44:34,150 --> 02:44:37,060
Kind of like, or is that
a pretty far jump?

4203
02:44:37,090 --> 02:44:38,660
MATT: I mean, you have
to still jump.

4204
02:44:38,690 --> 02:44:40,600
So you have to make
an athletics check.

4205
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:42,380
MARISHA: How far of a
jump is that?

4206
02:44:42,380 --> 02:44:44,480
MATT: It's about six,
seven feet.

4207
02:44:44,510 --> 02:44:46,720
So make an athletics check.

4208
02:44:46,750 --> 02:44:48,450
MARISHA: Sure, why not?

4209
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:51,120
Why not at this point?

4210
02:44:51,150 --> 02:44:53,450
LAURA: No, Keyleth, no.

4211
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:56,560
MARISHA: Well, that was
a natural one.

4212
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:58,010
TRAVIS: On what, on what?

4213
02:44:58,010 --> 02:44:59,150
SAM: Just moving.

4214
02:44:59,180 --> 02:45:01,030
MARISHA: Just trying
to jump across

4215
02:45:01,060 --> 02:45:03,180
what should have been
literally anything else.

4216
02:45:03,210 --> 02:45:05,190
TRAVIS: How many hit
points do you have?

4217
02:45:05,190 --> 02:45:06,700
How many hit
points do you have?

4218
02:45:06,700 --> 02:45:08,220
SAM: It doesn't matter,
she's not even

4219
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:10,090
gonna get over to
anyone to heal them.

4220
02:45:10,120 --> 02:45:11,840
-MARISHA: 60.
-LAURA: I don't know, man, lava.

4221
02:45:11,870 --> 02:45:13,300
TRAVIS: One six or six zero.

4222
02:45:13,330 --> 02:45:14,630
-TALIESIN: Six zero.
-SAM: She's fine.

4223
02:45:14,660 --> 02:45:16,090
But no, she's not
necessarily fine.

4224
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:17,660
LAURA: Lava has a
new rule now.

4225
02:45:17,690 --> 02:45:19,870
MATT: Well, not a new rule,
the actual rule.

4226
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,220
TRAVIS: The actual rule that we didn't
use the very very first time.

4227
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:24,720
But we felt it last time.

4228
02:45:24,750 --> 02:45:27,330
MATT: So, as you rush
over trying to help,

4229
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:30,060
you go to leap,
but your foot catches

4230
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:32,330
what you thought was
solid volcanic rock.

4231
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:34,720
Unfortunately,
it's brittle and broken

4232
02:45:34,750 --> 02:45:36,480
and it slips
beneath your foot.

4233
02:45:36,510 --> 02:45:38,600
In doing so, you only
get about three feet

4234
02:45:38,630 --> 02:45:41,600
before you plant the
lower half of your body

4235
02:45:41,630 --> 02:45:43,630
straight
into the lava.

4236
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:47,720
LAURA: Oh my God.

4237
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:49,330
TRAVIS: (laughing)

4238
02:45:49,330 --> 02:45:51,090
MATT: That's 53 points
of fire damage.

4239
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:52,210
-LAURA: 53!
-SAM: You're alive!

4240
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:54,070
LAURA: Get up, get out,
you can get out of it.

4241
02:45:54,070 --> 02:45:55,300
You've got
seven points left.

4242
02:45:55,330 --> 02:45:57,560
TALIESIN: You died as you lived.

4243
02:45:57,560 --> 02:45:59,540
MARISHA: A fucking dumbass, yeah!

4244
02:45:59,570 --> 02:46:00,840
TRAVIS: I can't see!

4245
02:46:00,870 --> 02:46:03,090
It's just a wall of tears.

4246
02:46:06,270 --> 02:46:09,110
LAURA: Can she get out
of the lava or is she just in?

4247
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:11,610
MARISHA: Can I get out now?
I'm trying to use my movement

4248
02:46:11,610 --> 02:46:12,980
or am I gonna
die if I get out?

4249
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:16,390
MATT: You're essentially prone in the lava.

4250
02:46:16,420 --> 02:46:19,470
You rolled a one to jump
and you basically went...

4251
02:46:19,470 --> 02:46:21,010
-LAURA: Belly flopped into lava.

4252
02:46:21,010 --> 02:46:23,780
LAURA: You mean, she's gonna take
damage trying to get out of it?

4253
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:25,240
MARISHA: Can I get out?

4254
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:26,840
MATT: You're technically prone.

4255
02:46:26,870 --> 02:46:28,660
The rest of your movement
will get you up and out,

4256
02:46:28,690 --> 02:46:30,060
but it'll just
get you out of the lava.

4257
02:46:30,090 --> 02:46:32,330
-LAURA: At least you're out.
-LIAM: Get out, get out.

4258
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:34,180
MATT: So, you'll get out and you'll
be just on the edge there.

4259
02:46:34,210 --> 02:46:35,510
LAURA: Oh my God.

4260
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:40,060
TRAVIS: This is the best.

4261
02:46:40,090 --> 02:46:42,130
LAURA: This is the worst!

4262
02:46:43,180 --> 02:46:44,960
MATT: Wow!

4263
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:47,420
MARISHA: I was like, as long
as I don't roll a one,

4264
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:49,180
that shouldn't
be that hard-- okay.

4265
02:46:49,180 --> 02:46:51,550
TALIESIN: Oh, look, someone left a
metaphor on the ground.

4266
02:46:51,550 --> 02:46:52,720
(laughter)

4267
02:46:52,750 --> 02:46:54,300
Don't step in it
or anything.

4268
02:46:54,300 --> 02:46:56,510
Oh God,
it's everywhere.

4269
02:46:57,630 --> 02:46:59,390
-TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
-MATT: Wow.

4270
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:01,210
TALIESIN: Well, this
could've gone worse.

4271
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:02,330
MATT: Wow!

4272
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:03,600
TALIESIN: Yeah!

4273
02:47:03,630 --> 02:47:05,270
MARISHA: Okay, I'm out
of the flame.

4274
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:07,430
MATT: This whole thing's
a metaphor for 2017.

4275
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:09,780
LAURA: Does J'Mon Sa Ord
have any healing spells?

4276
02:47:09,780 --> 02:47:12,540
MARISHA: And I reach over
as a bonus action

4277
02:47:12,570 --> 02:47:16,090
and do a Healing Word
to-- to Vax.

4278
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:18,060
MATT: Okay.

4279
02:47:18,090 --> 02:47:19,390
TRAVIS: Just--

4280
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:20,680
MATT: What level?

4281
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:24,840
MARISHA: I don't know.

4282
02:47:24,840 --> 02:47:25,970
TRAVIS: Come on, stay with it.

4283
02:47:25,970 --> 02:47:28,030
-Stay in the fight.
-MARISHA: Level one.

4284
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:30,600
Oh, that's good, that's
four so, nine points.

4285
02:47:30,630 --> 02:47:31,600
SAM: Nine points.

4286
02:47:31,630 --> 02:47:33,120
TRAVIS: He wakes up!

4287
02:47:33,150 --> 02:47:34,450
MATT: Vax is now conscious.

4288
02:47:34,480 --> 02:47:35,510
MARISHA: No, I'm sorry ten points,
that's ten points.

4289
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:37,540
-MATT: There you go.
-LAURA: Sweet, even better.

4290
02:47:37,570 --> 02:47:40,030
You're double digits.

4291
02:47:40,060 --> 02:47:43,570
Scanlan, we've got to just--
we've got to get Scanlan back.

4292
02:47:45,440 --> 02:47:49,390
TALIESIN: There's a lot of work
that needs to happen.

4293
02:47:49,390 --> 02:47:51,150
TRAVIS: I got her,
I got-- I got Pike.

4294
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:53,840
TALIESIN: Who's up?

4295
02:47:53,870 --> 02:47:55,000
SAM: Grog is up.

4296
02:47:55,030 --> 02:47:56,330
TALIESIN: I mean, who's next?

4297
02:47:56,360 --> 02:47:57,600
TRAVIS: I think it's me.

4298
02:47:57,630 --> 02:48:01,660
-LAURA: It's Gilmore.
-TRAVIS: No, it's Gilmore.

4299
02:48:01,690 --> 02:48:04,150
MATT: So, Gilmore gets up.

4300
02:48:04,180 --> 02:48:07,240
Kind of looks around.

4301
02:48:07,270 --> 02:48:08,870
"Where did she go?"

4302
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
TRAVIS: "Through the tunnel."

4303
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:12,450
MATT: Okay.

4304
02:48:12,480 --> 02:48:14,690
He rushes this way

4305
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:17,660
and as he gets
about there, he...

4306
02:48:17,690 --> 02:48:22,210
slams into something that
is currently invisible.

4307
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:24,240
You see a slight
ripple of arcane energy

4308
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:27,170
and you see a series
of small glyphs spiral outward

4309
02:48:27,170 --> 02:48:29,420
and then it goes
see-through again.

4310
02:48:29,450 --> 02:48:31,700
He starts slamming
his fists on it.

4311
02:48:32,510 --> 02:48:35,720
"Of course, of course.

4312
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:37,060
Of course."

4313
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:39,730
TRAVIS: No.

4314
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,420
MATT: He goes and...

4315
02:48:42,450 --> 02:48:45,690
Let's see what
he has left.

4316
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:48,600
TRAVIS: She made a
Lite Brite wall.

4317
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:49,870
MATT: Yeah.

4318
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,030
TRAVIS: He's a mime.

4319
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:54,720
MATT: Technically, he looks like a
mime from your standpoint.

4320
02:48:54,750 --> 02:48:57,720
MARISHA: Can I turn to J'Mon?

4321
02:48:57,750 --> 02:49:01,010
Say, "J'Mon, can you
sense her presence?

4322
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:02,250
She's a fellow dragon.

4323
02:49:02,250 --> 02:49:04,270
Do you know where
she might be going

4324
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:06,240
or what she
might be doing?"

4325
02:49:06,270 --> 02:49:07,940
MATT: "I haven't the faintest.

4326
02:49:07,940 --> 02:49:09,613
I only just arrived."

4327
02:49:11,780 --> 02:49:14,690
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck, Thordak is
outside of the cave!

4328
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:17,090
LIAM: Are we out of combat now?

4329
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:19,190
TRAVIS: Thordak is still
in the hallway.

4330
02:49:19,190 --> 02:49:20,780
LAURA: The round's still going.

4331
02:49:20,780 --> 02:49:23,060
MATT: So we're gonna continue going
through the order here.

4332
02:49:23,090 --> 02:49:24,720
LAURA: So, it's Grog,
it's your turn, Grog.

4333
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:25,870
MATT: So, Grog, it's your turn.

4334
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,540
TRAVIS: I run to my buddy,
Pike, and I beer bong

4335
02:49:29,570 --> 02:49:32,690
this Greater healing
potion into her gullet.

4336
02:49:32,720 --> 02:49:34,660
MATT: Okay.

4337
02:49:34,690 --> 02:49:37,150
-TRAVIS: What is that?
-LAURA: 4d8 plus four.

4338
02:49:37,180 --> 02:49:39,180
I mean, 4d4 plus four.

4339
02:49:39,210 --> 02:49:43,690
MATT: 4d4 plus four.

4340
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:45,210
TRAVIS: Eight.

4341
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:47,030
Twelve.

4342
02:49:47,060 --> 02:49:48,720
-Twelve points.
-LAURA: So, Pike is awake.

4343
02:49:48,750 --> 02:49:51,210
TRAVIS: "Hi, hi!"

4344
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:53,060
-"Go, heal!"
-LAURA: "What's going--"

4345
02:49:53,060 --> 02:49:55,210
TRAVIS: "Lot of problems."

4346
02:49:55,240 --> 02:49:58,030
SAM: Got any more of
those Revivify's?

4347
02:49:58,060 --> 02:50:00,090
MATT: Alright, that
ends your turn, Grog?

4348
02:50:00,120 --> 02:50:02,270
LAURA: Actually, she does have
a third level spell left.

4349
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:03,290
-MATT: You do.
-MARISHA: Really?

4350
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:04,060
-LAURA: Yes!

4351
02:50:04,060 --> 02:50:05,790
LAURA: She does have a
third level spell!

4352
02:50:05,790 --> 02:50:07,660
MARISHA: Well, yes, do that,
do that really quick!

4353
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:09,840
LAURA: She cast Revivify at fourth
level the last time.

4354
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:11,270
MARISHA: Do it, do it, do it.

4355
02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:13,630
TRAVIS: The eggs that
remain are toast?

4356
02:50:13,660 --> 02:50:14,720
LAURA: Holy shit.

4357
02:50:14,750 --> 02:50:16,960
MATT: Two of them are
completely destroyed

4358
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:19,350
and there is one that has
been shot and is leaking.

4359
02:50:19,350 --> 02:50:20,840
LAURA: I have it circled.

4360
02:50:20,870 --> 02:50:22,420
TALIESIN: Don't worry about it.

4361
02:50:22,450 --> 02:50:23,450
Let's get out there.

4362
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:25,120
TRAVIS: Alright, that
ends my turn.

4363
02:50:25,150 --> 02:50:26,420
MATT: Okay.

4364
02:50:26,450 --> 02:50:29,600
That brings us to Vex.

4365
02:50:29,630 --> 02:50:31,420
I need you to make
a death saving throw.

4366
02:50:31,450 --> 02:50:33,090
LAURA: Right.

4367
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:35,100
I'm scared of all these dice.

4368
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:38,020
TRAVIS: I'm using what's left of my
movement to go towards that egg.

4369
02:50:38,020 --> 02:50:39,560
MATT: Towards this egg?

4370
02:50:39,560 --> 02:50:41,680
-TRAVIS: Yeah, the one shot egg.
-MATT: Okay.

4371
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:44,210
♪

4372
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:46,290
TALIESIN: I'm gonna try
something weird.

4373
02:50:46,290 --> 02:50:49,110
MATT: That's two death
saving throws on Vex.

4374
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:51,360
-TRAVIS: You failed it?
-LAURA: I failed it.

4375
02:50:51,390 --> 02:50:52,420
MATT: Vax.

4376
02:50:52,450 --> 02:50:54,120
LIAM: I stumble over to my sister

4377
02:50:54,150 --> 02:50:57,840
and cast Lay on Hands and give
her five to bring her back.

4378
02:50:57,870 --> 02:51:00,480
MATT: So, yeah, cause you've
been giving it out--

4379
02:51:00,510 --> 02:51:03,330
LIAM: I haven't done anything
with Lay on Hands.

4380
02:51:03,330 --> 02:51:06,290
Or I might have done it once but
I always do very small amounts.

4381
02:51:06,290 --> 02:51:08,650
I have a total of 15 hit points
cause I'm a third level--

4382
02:51:08,650 --> 02:51:10,590
MATT: I'm pretty sure
you used it once before.

4383
02:51:10,590 --> 02:51:13,180
LIAM: But I've never used more
than five with that spell

4384
02:51:13,210 --> 02:51:14,240
cause it's
worthless to heal.

4385
02:51:14,270 --> 02:51:15,920
It's just good
for bringing up.

4386
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:17,800
So I have at least
10 hit points left.

4387
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:20,680
-MATT: Go for it.
-LIAM: Five hit points.

4388
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:23,210
LAURA: Yeah, cause the only
time you used it before

4389
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:25,090
was when you BAMFed
up to my broom

4390
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:26,480
after I grabbed
the dagger.

4391
02:51:26,510 --> 02:51:28,020
MATT: You're still
prone by the way.

4392
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:29,820
You just basically
crawled over and touched her.

4393
02:51:29,820 --> 02:51:31,030
-LIAM: That's fine.

4394
02:51:31,060 --> 02:51:33,370
I'm gonna use the rest
of my movement to stand.

4395
02:51:33,370 --> 02:51:36,300
MATT: Okay, so you stand up and you
still have half your movement

4396
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:37,270
if you wanted to.

4397
02:51:37,810 --> 02:51:40,360
LIAM: Everyone who's
down, who's down?

4398
02:51:40,390 --> 02:51:42,170
And I don't mean dead.

4399
02:51:43,300 --> 02:51:45,660
-Pike just got--
-TALIESIN: Pike's up.

4400
02:51:45,690 --> 02:51:47,720
MATT: Pike is conscious,
your sister's conscious.

4401
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:49,540
-LIAM: Is Kima conscious?
-LAURA: Yes.

4402
02:51:49,570 --> 02:51:50,540
Kima's conscious.

4403
02:51:50,570 --> 02:51:52,330
LIAM: So, we've got
dead Scanlan.

4404
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:56,240
TALIESIN: And that's--
that's Pike's problem.

4405
02:51:56,270 --> 02:51:58,480
LIAM: And that's it, I'm done.

4406
02:51:58,510 --> 02:51:59,910
Wait, where's that egg?

4407
02:51:59,910 --> 02:52:01,870
-MATT: Which one?
-LIAM: It doesn't matter.

4408
02:52:01,870 --> 02:52:03,280
LAURA: It's the last egg.

4409
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:04,870
LIAM: I'm done, I'm done.

4410
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:10,130
MATT: Alrighty, that
ends Vax's turn.

4411
02:52:10,130 --> 02:52:12,870
LAURA: Just worried there's gonna
be another lair action

4412
02:52:12,870 --> 02:52:14,300
in the same spot.

4413
02:52:14,330 --> 02:52:17,870
MATT: Kima rushes up and swinging
her holy sword in the air,

4414
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:21,750
goes for a full swing, noticing
that everybody's now conscious,

4415
02:52:21,780 --> 02:52:24,550
goes and takes a full swing
towards this invisible barrier.

4416
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:28,870
As it streaks across, you see
divine energy go flying off

4417
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,780
in a shower of sparks and
a giant shimmering,

4418
02:52:31,810 --> 02:52:34,390
shaking visual on this--

4419
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:38,330
this force wall that stands here
in the center of the hallway.

4420
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:41,510
As she finishes her attack,
it shimmers unscathed.

4421
02:52:41,540 --> 02:52:43,720
She goes for a
secondary attack.

4422
02:52:43,750 --> 02:52:44,780
Strikes again.

4423
02:52:44,810 --> 02:52:46,240
This time as it
strikes across

4424
02:52:46,270 --> 02:52:47,720
the sparks are even brighter

4425
02:52:47,750 --> 02:52:50,480
and you can see the impact
almost pushing her back

4426
02:52:50,510 --> 02:52:53,000
off of her feet and
as the blade comes

4427
02:52:53,030 --> 02:52:56,180
to the end of
its second arc.

4428
02:52:56,210 --> 02:52:58,300
She looks up. 
The wall still stands.

4429
02:52:58,330 --> 02:52:59,770
TRAVIS: You are shitting me.

4430
02:52:59,770 --> 02:53:01,120
It doesn't flicker,
doesn't--

4431
02:53:01,150 --> 02:53:03,400
LAURA: It needs like a
dispel or something.

4432
02:53:04,850 --> 02:53:06,390
MARISHA: Oh my God, I could--

4433
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:07,450
Oh my God, I could!

4434
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:09,360
TALIESIN: Alright, that's an option.

4435
02:53:09,390 --> 02:53:12,210
MATT: Alrighty that
brings us to...

4436
02:53:13,570 --> 02:53:14,870
-MATT: J'Mon.

4437
02:53:17,210 --> 02:53:19,720
J'Mon rushes.

4438
02:53:19,750 --> 02:53:22,690
Flies up to the edge and
kind of takes a moment

4439
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:25,390
streak a few claws across it.

4440
02:53:25,420 --> 02:53:26,840
And where the claws streak,

4441
02:53:26,870 --> 02:53:29,600
you can see the shimmering
of this force wall.

4442
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:35,810
TRAVIS: Well, phone's out, oh God.

4443
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:38,000
MATT: "The phone's out, oh God"?

4444
02:53:38,030 --> 02:53:40,320
SAM: He's calling an Uber
because he knows

4445
02:53:40,320 --> 02:53:43,020
we're gonna kill him
after this is done.

4446
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:45,230
MATT: Come on, four percent,
I got four percent left.

4447
02:53:45,230 --> 02:53:47,110
SAM: Four percent, get
this man a charger!

4448
02:53:47,110 --> 02:53:48,810
-MATT: I know.
-SAM: Taliesin!

4449
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:50,630
LIAM: No, no, no.

4450
02:53:50,660 --> 02:53:53,390
Let's start a
YouTube video on it.

4451
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:55,750
SAM: Can you run
this over to Matt?

4452
02:53:55,780 --> 02:53:57,810
MATT: Yeah.

4453
02:53:57,840 --> 02:54:01,720
J'Mon, with each strike, is like
testing the boundaries of it

4454
02:54:01,750 --> 02:54:04,200
across the sides of the
tunnel and just goes...

4455
02:54:06,140 --> 02:54:07,750
"This magic holds."

4456
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:09,330
TRAVIS: What?

4457
02:54:11,450 --> 02:54:12,480
It holds?

4458
02:54:12,510 --> 02:54:14,410
"It--it holds?"

4459
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:18,690
MATT: Fun charger.

4460
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:24,000
TALIESIN: Let me know, I've
got maybe a plan.

4461
02:54:24,030 --> 02:54:25,360
Yeah, you've got that.

4462
02:54:25,390 --> 02:54:27,330
That's an option,
I've got another plan.

4463
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:28,970
You know my plan, my
plan kind of sucks, but.

4464
02:54:28,970 --> 02:54:30,610
MATT: I'm not getting a charge.

4465
02:54:30,610 --> 02:54:32,180
SAM: Give it somebody else.

4466
02:54:32,210 --> 02:54:33,210
There's a button.

4467
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:34,530
MATT: That's alright.

4468
02:54:34,530 --> 02:54:36,270
It happens.

4469
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:37,510
Anyway.

4470
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:39,000
TALIESIN: No, no, it
should just start.

4471
02:54:39,030 --> 02:54:40,510
-SAM: No, there's a button.
-TALIESIN: Oh, there is a button.

4472
02:54:40,540 --> 02:54:42,400
SAM: There's a button,
he'll find it.

4473
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:45,390
MATT: J'Mon, oh, J'Mon gets
the breath weapon back.

4474
02:54:45,420 --> 02:54:49,120
And kind of pushes...

4475
02:54:49,150 --> 02:54:52,210
both Kima
and Gilmore aside.

4476
02:54:53,390 --> 02:54:55,000
"Excuse me."

4477
02:54:58,750 --> 02:55:03,330
And unleashes a blast of burning
hot breath across this wall.

4478
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:05,510
As it hits, it
just curls across

4479
02:55:05,540 --> 02:55:07,540
and spreads across
the side of the walls

4480
02:55:07,570 --> 02:55:10,490
as the dragon shields

4481
02:55:10,490 --> 02:55:13,810
both Kima and Gilmore
from the blast.

4482
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:16,850
As it finishes, the flame
has been split the entirety

4483
02:55:16,850 --> 02:55:18,300
and has no effect
on the wall.

4484
02:55:18,330 --> 02:55:20,470
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4485
02:55:21,330 --> 02:55:22,650
LAURA: I wonder--

4486
02:55:24,570 --> 02:55:27,270
I wonder if the
beehive thing above us,

4487
02:55:27,300 --> 02:55:30,180
that the holes are
covered in magic as well.

4488
02:55:30,570 --> 02:55:31,960
TRAVIS: Are you conscious?

4489
02:55:31,960 --> 02:55:33,510
LAURA: Am I-- I am conscious.

4490
02:55:33,510 --> 02:55:36,510
TALIESIN: I say, well, maybe killing
the eggs, I don't know.

4491
02:55:36,540 --> 02:55:38,150
Kill the eggs.

4492
02:55:38,180 --> 02:55:39,750
MATT: Pike.

4493
02:55:39,780 --> 02:55:41,090
TRAVIS: Or maybe it's like a
Pacific Rim--

4494
02:55:41,090 --> 02:55:43,270
LAURA: But I don't know
what that says.

4495
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:45,210
SAM: I--I can give it to you.

4496
02:55:45,240 --> 02:55:47,600
LAURA: But it's now.

4497
02:55:47,630 --> 02:55:52,210
My question is,
Pike runs up, thank you.

4498
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:53,870
Oh, oh!

4499
02:55:53,870 --> 02:55:55,810
If she runs up, is
she gonna be able

4500
02:55:55,840 --> 02:55:58,670
to get her hand
on-- on Scanlan?

4501
02:56:00,390 --> 02:56:02,080
MATT: Well, she was--

4502
02:56:03,510 --> 02:56:06,150
She was prone, right?

4503
02:56:06,180 --> 02:56:08,090
She just came back
to consciousness.

4504
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:09,360
So she gets up
for half her movement.

4505
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:11,240
TALIESIN: We got a minute.

4506
02:56:15,810 --> 02:56:17,150
Got a minute.

4507
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:19,180
TRAVIS: I would have picked
her up after the last time.

4508
02:56:19,210 --> 02:56:22,090
I was being pissed about-- I
mean, you know, she's so tiny.

4509
02:56:22,120 --> 02:56:24,360
MATT: Being a gnome, it's
one of those things

4510
02:56:24,390 --> 02:56:26,090
where 25 feet halved

4511
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:29,480
and you always round on
the lower end of the scale.

4512
02:56:29,510 --> 02:56:32,420
At ten feet, she's not close
enough to touch Scanlan.

4513
02:56:32,450 --> 02:56:33,510
Yet.

4514
02:56:33,540 --> 02:56:34,850
MARISHA: Even with the
Sprinter's Boots?

4515
02:56:34,850 --> 02:56:36,690
MATT: Sprinter's Boots
already got used.

4516
02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:38,150
It's got one round use.

4517
02:56:38,180 --> 02:56:40,180
LAURA: She says "She can use the
Sprinter's Boots twice"

4518
02:56:40,210 --> 02:56:42,000
in all caps.

4519
02:56:42,030 --> 02:56:43,530
MATT: Alright then.

4520
02:56:43,530 --> 02:56:45,710
TALIESIN: The caps are what
make it worthwhile.

4521
02:56:45,710 --> 02:56:47,170
MATT: I'll trust her.

4522
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:48,600
TRAVIS: She's on a 30 second delay

4523
02:56:48,630 --> 02:56:49,690
so she wrote that
before we said it.

4524
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:52,060
LAURA: Actually she did write
that before we said it.

4525
02:56:52,060 --> 02:56:53,390
-MATT: Good, alright then.

4526
02:56:53,420 --> 02:56:56,690
Then that will be just enough
to put her up next to Scanlan.

4527
02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:58,270
LAURA: Okay.

4528
02:56:58,300 --> 02:57:02,450
So, Pike puts her hands on
either side of his face

4529
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:06,870
and says, "Scanlan.

4530
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:10,300
Your letter to me
was wonderful

4531
02:57:10,330 --> 02:57:12,600
and I want to do
what you asked

4532
02:57:12,630 --> 02:57:16,180
but I can't raise Kaylee alone,
I need you to come back."

4533
02:57:16,210 --> 02:57:17,810
And she casts
Revivify on him.

4534
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:19,180
MATT: Okay.

4535
02:57:19,210 --> 02:57:20,600
Go ahead and
roll a d20.

4536
02:57:25,750 --> 02:57:27,360
LAURA: I'm so scared.

4537
02:57:33,330 --> 02:57:34,780
Thirteen?

4538
02:57:34,810 --> 02:57:36,870
MATT: Thirteen, okay.

4539
02:57:40,540 --> 02:57:44,780
As she implores to
the spirit of Scanlan

4540
02:57:44,810 --> 02:57:46,180
in this frozen form,

4541
02:57:48,450 --> 02:57:53,120
you watch as
the icy crystals

4542
02:57:53,150 --> 02:57:55,270
that have coalesced
around his form

4543
02:57:55,300 --> 02:57:58,300
and locked him in his place,
his face kind of--

4544
02:57:58,330 --> 02:58:01,150
This frozen
look of horror.

4545
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:03,750
The ice begins to turn
into mist around him

4546
02:58:03,780 --> 02:58:08,000
and his color begins
to return to his skin.

4547
02:58:08,030 --> 02:58:11,200
His expression relaxes
as his eyes suddenly focus

4548
02:58:11,200 --> 02:58:13,630
and Scanlan, you find
yourself conscious again

4549
02:58:13,660 --> 02:58:15,180
looking up at Pike.

4550
02:58:15,210 --> 02:58:19,240
Tears in her eyes, pulling her
hand back from your shoulder.

4551
02:58:19,270 --> 02:58:22,090
Looking up into
the dark, you know,

4552
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:25,600
glowing lit interior
of Thordak's lair.

4553
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:29,140
SAM: Don't cry.

4554
02:58:30,600 --> 02:58:32,780
I'm just a little cold.

4555
02:58:32,810 --> 02:58:34,240
LAURA: "Warm up.

4556
02:58:34,270 --> 02:58:36,120
Does anybody
have a blanket?"

4557
02:58:36,150 --> 02:58:38,570
-SAM: "Just hold me."
-LAURA: "Okay."

4558
02:58:38,570 --> 02:58:40,840
-TRAVIS: She sent a picture.
-LAURA: She did.

4559
02:58:40,840 --> 02:58:43,000
She sent a picture
of the Sprinter's Boots cards

4560
02:58:43,030 --> 02:58:44,000
with two uses.

4561
02:58:44,030 --> 02:58:45,270
TRAVIS: "Used twice
while in rest..."

4562
02:58:45,300 --> 02:58:46,420
MATT: There we go.

4563
02:58:46,450 --> 02:58:49,750
Cool, that's what
I wanted, thank you.

4564
02:58:49,780 --> 02:58:52,390
So make sure everyone has
their equipment cards on them.

4565
02:58:52,420 --> 02:58:55,270
Alright, so that
finishes Pike's turn.

4566
02:58:55,300 --> 02:58:58,480
Scanlan, you're
conscious now.

4567
02:59:02,390 --> 02:59:03,490
SAM: Hi.

4568
02:59:03,490 --> 02:59:06,150
TRAVIS: Welcome back, we're
still fucked by the way.

4569
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:07,420
SAM: What's going on?

4570
02:59:07,450 --> 02:59:08,780
TRAVIS: They sealed us in here

4571
02:59:08,810 --> 02:59:11,690
with a giant magic
screen across this door.

4572
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:14,570
Dragon's breath does
nothing, Kima does nothing.

4573
02:59:14,600 --> 02:59:16,630
You know anything
about this?

4574
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:21,030
Any limericks for
magic cave doors?

4575
02:59:21,060 --> 02:59:22,270
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4576
02:59:22,300 --> 02:59:23,870
LAURA: Glad you're
back, Scanlan.

4577
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,510
SAM: Thanks, thanks.

4578
02:59:26,540 --> 02:59:31,150
I've got one
thing up my sleeve.

4579
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:33,810
It's a dog that can
run around and help us.

4580
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:35,330
That's about it.

4581
02:59:35,980 --> 02:59:38,480
LAURA: Are we gonna have
to take a short rest?

4582
02:59:38,510 --> 02:59:39,540
TALIESIN: No.

4583
02:59:39,570 --> 02:59:41,090
SAM: I don't know,
I don't know.

4584
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:42,480
What-- there's
magic there?

4585
02:59:42,510 --> 02:59:43,600
I can't do
anything about that.

4586
02:59:43,630 --> 02:59:45,450
LAURA: Can I-- can I--
I know I'm gonna--

4587
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:47,420
Can I broom up
to the holes?

4588
02:59:47,450 --> 02:59:49,210
God, I'm so scared to
get on this broom again.

4589
02:59:49,240 --> 02:59:51,120
TALIESIN: Well, it's not--
we're still--

4590
02:59:51,150 --> 02:59:53,000
LAURA: Oh, in our order?

4591
02:59:53,030 --> 02:59:55,160
MARISHA: We're still
going in order?

4592
02:59:55,160 --> 02:59:58,540
MARISHA: Do you still have a Mansion?

4593
02:59:58,540 --> 03:00:01,210
MATT: Well, right now, as we're
getting back into this.

4594
03:00:01,240 --> 03:00:02,660
Percy, what are you doing?

4595
03:00:02,690 --> 03:00:03,720
MARISHA: I have a crazy plan.

4596
03:00:03,750 --> 03:00:05,090
LAURA: Did you let the dog out?

4597
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:06,420
SAM: No, I don't know what--

4598
03:00:06,450 --> 03:00:07,780
TRAVIS: Who let the dog out?

4599
03:00:07,810 --> 03:00:10,570
LAURA: Scanlan, did you
let the dog out?

4600
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:12,180
SAM: Keyleth, do you
have a crazy plan?

4601
03:00:12,210 --> 03:00:15,450
MARISHA: You only have
to cast the Mansion Door

4602
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:17,690
within line of
sight, correct?

4603
03:00:17,720 --> 03:00:19,570
SAM: Yes.

4604
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:21,520
MARISHA: Okay.

4605
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:23,720
SAM: I don't know that
that's true actually.

4606
03:00:23,750 --> 03:00:26,180
Three hundred feet,
300 feet range.

4607
03:00:26,210 --> 03:00:27,630
LAURA: Do you have it left?

4608
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:28,630
-SAM: I do.
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

4609
03:00:28,660 --> 03:00:30,150
MARISHA: Okay, two things.

4610
03:00:30,180 --> 03:00:34,720
One, before we start burning
our seventh level spells,

4611
03:00:34,750 --> 03:00:36,480
I still have
Stone Shape.

4612
03:00:36,510 --> 03:00:40,240
Can Keyleth go up to the
wall and do I have enough--

4613
03:00:40,270 --> 03:00:42,540
is there just enough
room in the corridor walls

4614
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:43,840
that I could
Stone Shape--

4615
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:45,740
SAM: I could Dimension Door
out of here.

4616
03:00:45,740 --> 03:00:47,030
LAURA: Why would you just--

4617
03:00:47,030 --> 03:00:48,330
LIAM: You get a tunnel
for all of us, mate.

4618
03:00:48,360 --> 03:00:50,150
SAM: Yeah, that would just be me.

4619
03:00:50,150 --> 03:00:53,690
MARISHA: Can I Stone Shape a tunnel
kind of around the thing?

4620
03:00:53,720 --> 03:00:54,550
Or is--

4621
03:00:55,080 --> 03:00:56,830
MATT: First things first,

4622
03:00:56,830 --> 03:00:58,540
Mordenkainen's
Magnificent Mansion

4623
03:00:58,570 --> 03:01:00,390
is a one minute
casting time.

4624
03:01:00,420 --> 03:01:03,090
MARISHA: Okay.

4625
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:05,180
MATT: So you could do it, but
in the process of doing so,

4626
03:01:05,210 --> 03:01:07,390
you'd probably go through
about 10 different lair actions

4627
03:01:07,400 --> 03:01:08,590
in here.

4628
03:01:08,590 --> 03:01:10,000
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's that.

4629
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,660
MATT: So, Keyleth, you're using,
you said, stone--

4630
03:01:12,690 --> 03:01:16,480
MARISHA: Can I Stone Shape a
little passage around?

4631
03:01:16,510 --> 03:01:20,030
Do I have just enough
kinda to where I can--

4632
03:01:20,060 --> 03:01:23,240
where the barrier is
I can kind of carve

4633
03:01:23,270 --> 03:01:25,060
a little corridor around?

4634
03:01:25,090 --> 03:01:26,890
LIAM: Around or under?

4635
03:01:29,300 --> 03:01:31,690
MATT: It would be very tiny

4636
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:34,630
and you'd have to crawl
through to create enough--

4637
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:37,060
Cause you're not quite sure
how thick the barrier is,

4638
03:01:37,090 --> 03:01:39,810
so you have to be--

4639
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:41,060
have to roll an
investigation check

4640
03:01:41,090 --> 03:01:43,360
and based on your
roll, I'll let you know.

4641
03:01:43,390 --> 03:01:45,390
MARISHA: Okay.

4642
03:01:45,420 --> 03:01:47,720
TALIESIN: This is a plan.

4643
03:01:47,750 --> 03:01:48,870
MARISHA: Eight.

4644
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,030
MATT: Eight?

4645
03:01:50,060 --> 03:01:51,540
You're not sure,
you can give it a shot.

4646
03:01:51,570 --> 03:01:53,360
MARISHA: I'm-- might as well
give it a shot, I mean--

4647
03:01:53,390 --> 03:01:55,000
MATT: Before it gets to you, it does
come back to a lair action.

4648
03:01:55,030 --> 03:01:56,000
LAURA: Wait, but--

4649
03:01:56,030 --> 03:01:57,810
SAM: On my turn,
I drank a potion.

4650
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:59,360
MATT: Okay, so take
your healing.

4651
03:01:59,390 --> 03:02:00,750
SAM: That's it.

4652
03:02:00,780 --> 03:02:03,090
TALIESIN: Has my
turn not come up yet?

4653
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:05,750
LAURA: I hate that we can't get
out of this fucking area!

4654
03:02:05,780 --> 03:02:07,510
MATT: Sorry, I asked
you what you were doing.

4655
03:02:07,540 --> 03:02:09,720
TALIESIN: Oh, I want to
try something stupid.

4656
03:02:09,750 --> 03:02:10,840
MATT: What do you want to try?

4657
03:02:10,870 --> 03:02:13,600
TALIESIN: I want to try and run
headlong at the barrier.

4658
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:14,540
MATT: Okay.

4659
03:02:14,570 --> 03:02:15,780
Well, you have to--

4660
03:02:17,110 --> 03:02:19,550
LAURA: Don't get too close
into this area, Percy,

4661
03:02:19,550 --> 03:02:22,060
cause this is where the fucking
lair action keeps coming up.

4662
03:02:22,060 --> 03:02:23,420
TALIESIN: I want to stay
on the wall.

4663
03:02:23,450 --> 03:02:24,420
MATT: Stay on the wall, okay.

4664
03:02:24,450 --> 03:02:26,120
Leaving you roughly there.

4665
03:02:26,150 --> 03:02:27,630
So even a full turn,

4666
03:02:27,660 --> 03:02:29,300
that's as far as you could
get on a double run.

4667
03:02:29,330 --> 03:02:31,810
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm up
on the wall still.

4668
03:02:31,840 --> 03:02:33,390
MATT: Cool.

4669
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:35,750
Alright, now--
now this happens.

4670
03:02:38,870 --> 03:02:42,150
With this, the
quakiness of the lair

4671
03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:45,420
seems to be subsiding
a little bit.

4672
03:02:45,450 --> 03:02:49,300
There is a tremor
on the ground.

4673
03:02:49,330 --> 03:02:51,270
It only effects those
directly around the barrier,

4674
03:02:51,300 --> 03:02:53,420
so that's my people.

4675
03:02:57,140 --> 03:02:59,300
Everyone succeeds,
so no one falls prone.

4676
03:02:59,330 --> 03:03:02,060
So no effect on that
lair action, per se.

4677
03:03:05,450 --> 03:03:07,400
Alright, past that.

4678
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:11,870
You can see in
the distance,

4679
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:13,840
past the wall,
dark in the tunnel,

4680
03:03:13,870 --> 03:03:15,720
which is almost pitch
black beyond the radius,

4681
03:03:15,750 --> 03:03:18,210
you see this slight
purplish glow

4682
03:03:18,240 --> 03:03:19,420
and then a flash
of purple energy.

4683
03:03:19,450 --> 03:03:21,180
TALIESIN: God, fucking damn it!

4684
03:03:21,180 --> 03:03:22,750
MARISHA: Talking to Thordak!

4685
03:03:22,750 --> 03:03:23,960
SAM: Should I go?

4686
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:25,750
LAURA: What are you gonna do?

4687
03:03:25,750 --> 03:03:27,150
SAM: Distract it, do something.

4688
03:03:27,150 --> 03:03:28,710
TRAVIS: You're gonna be
all by yourself.

4689
03:03:28,710 --> 03:03:30,440
MARISHA: Okay, I'm gonna
Stone Shape

4690
03:03:30,440 --> 03:03:32,030
and try and just
cast a little,

4691
03:03:32,060 --> 03:03:34,510
even if it's a corridor
just right around.

4692
03:03:34,510 --> 03:03:37,240
MATT: It's a touch spell so
you have to get up to it,

4693
03:03:37,270 --> 03:03:40,420
so you're back there.

4694
03:03:40,450 --> 03:03:43,420
So you just get up to
the edge of the doorway

4695
03:03:43,450 --> 03:03:45,060
and the wall
with a double run.

4696
03:03:45,090 --> 03:03:46,420
-MARISHA: Okay.
-MATT: Okay?

4697
03:03:46,450 --> 03:03:48,890
MARISHA: I'm go ahead and
can I use a bonus action.

4698
03:03:48,890 --> 03:03:50,000
MATT: Yeah.

4699
03:03:51,450 --> 03:03:53,690
MARISHA: I'm gonna use
my-- no, no, no,

4700
03:03:53,720 --> 03:03:56,300
I'm gonna just drink a
healing potion real quick.

4701
03:03:56,330 --> 03:03:58,210
Just one of my Greaters.

4702
03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:00,240
MATT: Okay, go for it.

4703
03:04:00,270 --> 03:04:02,110
So it is 4d4 plus four.

4704
03:04:04,480 --> 03:04:05,660
Alright.

4705
03:04:05,690 --> 03:04:07,600
Gilmore.

4706
03:04:09,830 --> 03:04:12,070
TALIESIN: This poor book
has seen better days.

4707
03:04:12,070 --> 03:04:14,120
MATT: Gilmore doesn't
really have anything

4708
03:04:14,150 --> 03:04:16,150
that can be of
aid right now.

4709
03:04:16,150 --> 03:04:18,150
MATT: Gilmore moves
over towards you.

4710
03:04:18,150 --> 03:04:19,870
Preparing for
what you're up to,

4711
03:04:19,870 --> 03:04:22,630
and just kind of puts his hand
on your shoulder, Keyleth,

4712
03:04:22,660 --> 03:04:25,420
and goes, "Whatever you're
doing, I'm right behind you.

4713
03:04:25,450 --> 03:04:26,820
Don't worry."

4714
03:04:27,280 --> 03:04:29,210
TALIESIN: Hold you up so
you don't fall.

4715
03:04:29,240 --> 03:04:30,840
MATT: Grog, you're up.

4716
03:04:30,870 --> 03:04:32,300
MARISHA: I'm not feeling very
confident right now.

4717
03:04:32,330 --> 03:04:35,240
TRAVIS: You look like you're up to
something, do you have a plan?

4718
03:04:35,240 --> 03:04:38,330
MARISHA: I'm trying to Stone Shape
a corridor through this,

4719
03:04:38,360 --> 03:04:40,270
but I don't know if
it's going to be enough

4720
03:04:40,300 --> 03:04:41,660
to get through
the thickness.

4721
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:43,720
-TRAVIS: Right, as a backup plan...

4722
03:04:43,750 --> 03:04:45,810
TRAVIS: How big is
J'Mon Sa Ord?

4723
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:47,810
Like a big dragon
or just like eh?

4724
03:04:47,840 --> 03:04:51,150
MATT: About the same
size as Raishan.

4725
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:53,720
TRAVIS: So, we couldn't like
all Falcor on J'Mon

4726
03:04:53,750 --> 03:04:56,720
up to the spider network of
tunnels in the ceiling, right?

4727
03:04:56,750 --> 03:04:58,300
Like we couldn't ride him.

4728
03:04:58,330 --> 03:05:02,420
MATT: Raishan and J'Mon have a
very similar physicality.

4729
03:05:02,450 --> 03:05:05,270
Like their bodies can, much
like a cat can get really thin,

4730
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:07,720
just enough to fit
through the tunnels, maybe,

4731
03:05:07,720 --> 03:05:09,040
but not with any riders.

4732
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:10,850
You guys would probably
be squeezed off

4733
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:12,480
or crushed in
the process.

4734
03:05:12,510 --> 03:05:13,780
TRAVIS: Could she get us up there

4735
03:05:13,810 --> 03:05:16,130
and then follow us up
through the tunnels if we--

4736
03:05:16,130 --> 03:05:18,030
TALIESIN: We don't know
where they go.

4737
03:05:18,030 --> 03:05:20,030
TRAVIS: It's better
than this place.

4738
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:21,360
They're exhaust tunnels.

4739
03:05:21,390 --> 03:05:22,660
TALIESIN: That's fair, although I
will say, before we leave,

4740
03:05:22,690 --> 03:05:24,330
we should probably make
sure all those eggs are down

4741
03:05:24,360 --> 03:05:26,870
-before we leave anyway.
-TRAVIS: That's my idea.

4742
03:05:26,870 --> 03:05:30,620
And then, I'm
gonna end my turn.

4743
03:05:30,620 --> 03:05:32,350
LAURA: Are you gonna run
and hit an egg?

4744
03:05:32,350 --> 03:05:33,320
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!

4745
03:05:33,320 --> 03:05:35,170
LAURA: There's an egg
left over there.

4746
03:05:35,170 --> 03:05:37,290
-TALIESIN: Hit an egg.
-TRAVIS: Shamone!

4747
03:05:37,290 --> 03:05:39,020
Yeah, I'll just
run towards egg.

4748
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:39,610
Ooh!

4749
03:05:39,610 --> 03:05:41,780
I'm gonna use all three
of my attacks on that egg.

4750
03:05:41,810 --> 03:05:43,810
MATT: Go for it.

4751
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:45,180
Go for it.

4752
03:05:45,210 --> 03:05:47,270
MARISHA: Egg doesn't know
what's coming.

4753
03:05:47,300 --> 03:05:49,870
TRAVIS: That's a-- that's a 33.

4754
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,180
-MATT: That'll hit.
-TRAVIS: Oh, minus five.

4755
03:05:52,210 --> 03:05:53,840
Okay.

4756
03:06:02,090 --> 03:06:06,330
That's a 31, no, 39.

4757
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:08,540
MATT: Okay, so the first strike

4758
03:06:08,570 --> 03:06:10,750
just cleaves through
the egg entirely.

4759
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:12,570
-TRAVIS: Oh.
-MATT: I know.

4760
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:16,150
You impact at the point of the
bullet that Percy left earlier,

4761
03:06:16,180 --> 03:06:19,030
which kind of left that
spider web crack in the front

4762
03:06:19,030 --> 03:06:21,330
and that just causes
the entire thing to buckle

4763
03:06:21,360 --> 03:06:23,840
under the sheer force
of your axe as it swings.

4764
03:06:23,870 --> 03:06:26,270
The egg gets cut
in half, tumbles over,

4765
03:06:26,300 --> 03:06:30,360
splattering primordial
dragon whelp gore

4766
03:06:30,390 --> 03:06:32,390
and you can see
the remnants inside

4767
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:35,100
of what is now a two-parter
primordial dragon whelp.

4768
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:36,640
LAURA: Did it look
like Thordak?

4769
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:38,830
TRAVIS: Did any dragon parts
spill out of the egg?

4770
03:06:38,830 --> 03:06:40,630
MATT: Yeah, as it flew
off and kind--

4771
03:06:40,660 --> 03:06:42,750
TRAVIS: Could I grab a piece
of it, take a step back

4772
03:06:42,780 --> 03:06:45,390
and try and like throw
it towards the wall

4773
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:47,690
to see if it bounces
off as well?

4774
03:06:47,720 --> 03:06:50,120
Just in case it's like a,
you know, lair barcode?

4775
03:06:50,150 --> 03:06:51,270
MATT: Sure.

4776
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:53,000
TRAVIS: Hey, we got through!

4777
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:54,660
MARISHA: They got the key card.

4778
03:06:54,690 --> 03:06:56,840
TALIESIN: Multi-pass.

4779
03:06:56,870 --> 03:07:00,240
MATT: As you pull it up,
and this creature is,

4780
03:07:00,270 --> 03:07:02,240
nearly identical to the one
that you pulled out earlier.

4781
03:07:02,270 --> 03:07:06,690
It's still deep red crimson,

4782
03:07:06,720 --> 03:07:10,540
but like fully, fully
primordial in its visual.

4783
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:13,240
You take back a chunk of it
and you throw it at the wall

4784
03:07:13,270 --> 03:07:15,240
and it just
passes through.

4785
03:07:15,270 --> 03:07:16,080
(gasps)

4786
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:17,130
SAM: What just happened?

4787
03:07:17,130 --> 03:07:18,750
-MARISHA: Shut up!
-LAURA: You were right!

4788
03:07:18,780 --> 03:07:20,170
SAM: What did he just do?

4789
03:07:20,170 --> 03:07:21,950
TALIESIN: You solved it!

4790
03:07:21,950 --> 03:07:23,450
SAM: How, what did he do?

4791
03:07:23,480 --> 03:07:25,060
LIAM: Destroying the last egg.

4792
03:07:25,090 --> 03:07:26,720
SAM: Fucking guy!

4793
03:07:26,750 --> 03:07:28,030
LAURA: Or by--

4794
03:07:28,060 --> 03:07:30,060
MARISHA: Or by-- it's
like he said.

4795
03:07:30,090 --> 03:07:31,390
We cover ourselves
in dragon goo

4796
03:07:31,420 --> 03:07:32,480
and then we
can walk through.

4797
03:07:32,510 --> 03:07:33,780
TALIESIN: One of the two.

4798
03:07:33,810 --> 03:07:35,720
TRAVIS: Residual goo in my hand, I just
like rub it all on my face.

4799
03:07:35,750 --> 03:07:37,120
MATT: It smells terrible.

4800
03:07:37,150 --> 03:07:38,120
TALIESIN: You can hop in the egg.

4801
03:07:38,150 --> 03:07:39,300
It's basically
a hot tub.

4802
03:07:39,330 --> 03:07:41,180
MARISHA: We didn't destroy
all the eggs, right?

4803
03:07:41,210 --> 03:07:43,120
MATT: Currently, you destroyed
three of them

4804
03:07:43,150 --> 03:07:46,270
and two were
lightning baked

4805
03:07:46,300 --> 03:07:47,900
and taken off
by Raishan.

4806
03:07:47,900 --> 03:07:49,300
SAM: My voice
is my passport.

4807
03:07:49,330 --> 03:07:50,600
MARISHA: So, do it.

4808
03:07:50,630 --> 03:07:52,570
It's hard to say.

4809
03:07:52,600 --> 03:07:54,250
TALIESIN: I love that movie.

4810
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:55,920
LAURA: Maybe we should
hold onto a piece

4811
03:07:55,920 --> 03:07:57,120
and try to
pass through it.

4812
03:07:57,150 --> 03:07:58,390
TALIESIN: Hello.

4813
03:07:58,420 --> 03:07:59,750
MATT: Well, that
finishes Grog's turn.

4814
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:00,840
Vex?

4815
03:08:00,870 --> 03:08:02,410
LAURA: That's me.

4816
03:08:03,570 --> 03:08:06,410
I used a level-- did I use
a level four spell already?

4817
03:08:06,410 --> 03:08:07,130
Shit.

4818
03:08:07,130 --> 03:08:09,670
MATT: I'm pretty sure you guys
went down guns blazing.

4819
03:08:09,670 --> 03:08:11,690
TALIESIN: Somewhere in the world, there's
a whole chatroom of people

4820
03:08:11,690 --> 03:08:13,330
yelling at you
telling you--

4821
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:14,360
LAURA: Oh, that's
right, I did.

4822
03:08:14,390 --> 03:08:15,850
I did use it
cause I was--

4823
03:08:15,850 --> 03:08:17,690
MARISHA: Yeah, I was gonna
say, "somewhere"?

4824
03:08:17,720 --> 03:08:19,540
LAURA: So I have a
level three left.

4825
03:08:19,570 --> 03:08:20,870
Who needs healing?

4826
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,150
Me and Pike
and everybody.

4827
03:08:23,180 --> 03:08:25,270
TALIESIN: There's always--
everybody needs healing.

4828
03:08:25,300 --> 03:08:26,810
-MARISHA: Me.
-LAURA: You do.

4829
03:08:26,810 --> 03:08:28,250
SAM: I got single
dig going on.

4830
03:08:28,250 --> 03:08:29,810
LAURA: So do I, I got five.

4831
03:08:29,840 --> 03:08:31,060
TRAVIS: Single dig.

4832
03:08:31,090 --> 03:08:32,650
LAURA: I got five points,
how many you got?

4833
03:08:32,650 --> 03:08:35,030
SAM: I got eight or nine,
I can't remember my math.

4834
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:37,000
It's pretty bad.

4835
03:08:37,030 --> 03:08:40,630
Wait, if I had one,
plus eight would be nine.

4836
03:08:40,660 --> 03:08:42,410
LAURA: So you have
nine points.

4837
03:08:42,410 --> 03:08:44,030
I'm gonna take
a healing potion.

4838
03:08:44,030 --> 03:08:46,210
I mean, I'm gonna cast
Cure Wounds on myself.

4839
03:08:46,240 --> 03:08:48,480
-MATT: Okay.
-SAM: Oh, yeah, you do your thing.

4840
03:08:48,510 --> 03:08:51,210
MATT: 3d8 plus whatever your
modifier is, go for it.

4841
03:08:52,630 --> 03:08:54,270
TALIESIN: It's all good.

4842
03:08:55,690 --> 03:08:57,120
MARISHA: Kind of.

4843
03:08:57,150 --> 03:09:00,100
TALIESIN: No, it's not, I know,
but like, it's looking better.

4844
03:09:00,100 --> 03:09:01,810
MARISHA: Well, we're not all dead.

4845
03:09:01,810 --> 03:09:03,710
We just can't die anymore.

4846
03:09:03,710 --> 03:09:06,570
TALIESIN: And worst case scenario, we're
stuck in here for another round.

4847
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:08,120
LAURA: So, 20 points.

4848
03:09:08,150 --> 03:09:10,210
-MATT: Twenty points, okay.
-LAURA: Okay.

4849
03:09:10,240 --> 03:09:12,390
TALIESIN: And you didn't
even burn a spell yet.

4850
03:09:12,390 --> 03:09:13,630
LAURA: Can I run over

4851
03:09:13,660 --> 03:09:15,540
and get some
dragon guts on my hand

4852
03:09:15,570 --> 03:09:18,660
and then to try to put
my hand through the thingy?

4853
03:09:18,690 --> 03:09:20,750
MATT: With your speed and getting up,
cause you were prone.

4854
03:09:20,780 --> 03:09:22,580
LAURA: Please let me
out of this spot.

4855
03:09:22,580 --> 03:09:23,900
MATT: That close right there.

4856
03:09:23,900 --> 03:09:25,360
You can't quite get
to the dragon guts.

4857
03:09:25,360 --> 03:09:26,660
That's as far
as you can get.

4858
03:09:26,690 --> 03:09:28,300
TALIESIN: It may just
be that it's down now,

4859
03:09:28,330 --> 03:09:29,660
but it may be
the dragon guts.

4860
03:09:29,690 --> 03:09:31,240
MATT: Alright, so that
ends Vex's turn, Vax.

4861
03:09:31,270 --> 03:09:32,420
Whatcha doing?

4862
03:09:32,450 --> 03:09:34,400
LIAM: I'm just gonna move
towards the gate.

4863
03:09:34,400 --> 03:09:36,280
Put my hand out and
see if I can go through

4864
03:09:36,280 --> 03:09:37,300
or if I get stopped.

4865
03:09:37,330 --> 03:09:39,060
MATT: You walk right through.

4866
03:09:39,090 --> 03:09:40,120
TALIESIN: Alright!

4867
03:09:40,150 --> 03:09:41,210
LAURA: Oh!

4868
03:09:41,240 --> 03:09:43,120
MARISHA: It's the eggs,
it was the eggs.

4869
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:44,360
LIAM: Alright, everybody!

4870
03:09:44,390 --> 03:09:46,120
Quietly.

4871
03:09:46,150 --> 03:09:48,400
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on.

4872
03:09:49,570 --> 03:09:52,720
I'm feeling very guilty
because it was my rage

4873
03:09:52,750 --> 03:09:55,090
and anger and
want for vengeance

4874
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:58,750
which made me run in here
blindly towards her,

4875
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:01,160
maybe we shouldn't do it
again is all I'm saying.

4876
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:02,190
TALIESIN: No, too late.

4877
03:10:02,190 --> 03:10:03,450
Got to finish this off.

4878
03:10:03,480 --> 03:10:04,570
MARISHA: Okay.

4879
03:10:04,600 --> 03:10:06,990
LAURA: Does your guilt have
a Mass Cure Wounds?

4880
03:10:06,990 --> 03:10:09,300
In that case,
doesn't matter.

4881
03:10:09,330 --> 03:10:11,110
MATT: "Forward, now!"

4882
03:10:11,120 --> 03:10:13,570
And all of you
just start...

4883
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:16,420
MARISHA: Avengers Run
down the hall.

4884
03:10:16,450 --> 03:10:18,390
MATT: Like crawling
over all of you.

4885
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:20,330
TALIESIN: Avengers, it's
clobbering time.

4886
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:24,450
SAM: I--I grab Kima and I say,
"Get ready to hit a dragon,"

4887
03:10:24,480 --> 03:10:27,850
and I'm gonna Dimension Door
me and Kima to Thordak's body.

4888
03:10:27,850 --> 03:10:29,520
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: Oh, geez.

4889
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:31,030
MATT: Kima goes, "Wait, what?"

4890
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:32,870
As soon as you
grab the shoulder

4891
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:34,690
and you both
suddenly vanish

4892
03:10:34,720 --> 03:10:37,240
and reappear at
Thordak's body.

4893
03:10:37,270 --> 03:10:40,540
You both land with
a flash of arcane light.

4894
03:10:40,570 --> 03:10:43,000
As your feet
hit the ground,

4895
03:10:43,030 --> 03:10:46,000
it is an empty tunnel.

4896
03:10:46,030 --> 03:10:47,480
So, no Raishan.

4897
03:10:47,510 --> 03:10:49,480
-There is no Thordak corpse.
-LAURA: Fuck.

4898
03:10:49,510 --> 03:10:51,820
-SAM: There's no Thordak's corpse?
-MARISHA: There's no Thordak's corpse?

4899
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:54,120
-MATT: Correct.
-LAURA: Fuck!

4900
03:10:54,150 --> 03:10:55,180
Fuck.

4901
03:10:55,210 --> 03:10:57,040
LIAM: She just wanted
to talk to it.

4902
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:59,090
TALIESIN: She may have
taken him somewhere.

4903
03:10:59,120 --> 03:11:00,570
TRAVIS: Talk to it, my ass.

4904
03:11:00,570 --> 03:11:02,060
She didn't want
to talk to it.

4905
03:11:02,060 --> 03:11:03,700
MARISHA: Or she raised him.

4906
03:11:03,700 --> 03:11:05,320
Jesus.

4907
03:11:05,330 --> 03:11:07,090
LIAM: One last roll
in the hay.

4908
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:09,920
MATT: As you guys approach, Gilmore
steps up and goes,

4909
03:11:09,920 --> 03:11:11,660
"I think I have
a pretty good idea

4910
03:11:11,690 --> 03:11:13,240
what that flash
we saw was."

4911
03:11:13,270 --> 03:11:15,020
-MARISHA: What?
-TALIESIN: Teleport.

4912
03:11:15,020 --> 03:11:17,000
MATT: "Getting the
hell out of here.

4913
03:11:17,030 --> 03:11:18,840
Son of a bitch!"

4914
03:11:18,870 --> 03:11:20,840
He takes a rock
and throws it.

4915
03:11:20,870 --> 03:11:21,870
Hair's kind
of tussled.

4916
03:11:21,870 --> 03:11:24,390
MARISHA: Vex, can you sense
dragons anywhere nearby?

4917
03:11:24,390 --> 03:11:28,720
LAURA: Can I sense anyone but J'Mon Sa
Ord as far as dragons go nearby?

4918
03:11:28,750 --> 03:11:31,600
I drop down to my
knees and concentrate.

4919
03:11:31,630 --> 03:11:33,270
-MATT: No.
-LAURA: Nothing!

4920
03:11:33,300 --> 03:11:34,300
Nothing.

4921
03:11:34,330 --> 03:11:36,610
She's nowhere.

4922
03:11:37,690 --> 03:11:38,790
Fuck.

4923
03:11:38,790 --> 03:11:41,290
MATT: And that's where we'll
end tonight's episode.

4924
03:11:41,290 --> 03:11:43,360
(all groaning)

4925
03:11:43,390 --> 03:11:45,570
We have a flight
early in the morning.

4926
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:46,840
TRAVIS: Oh!

4927
03:11:46,870 --> 03:11:49,600
LAURA: I can't believe
that we all came back.

4928
03:11:49,630 --> 03:11:51,580
TALIESIN: I can't believe
we all lived.

4929
03:11:51,580 --> 03:11:53,360
MATT: I can't believe
you all lived.

4930
03:11:53,360 --> 03:11:55,360
TALIESIN: That should
not have happened.

4931
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:56,810
MARISHA: That was
really scary.

4932
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:59,000
LAURA: It was just
giant clusterfuck

4933
03:11:59,030 --> 03:12:00,480
from like halfway through

4934
03:12:00,510 --> 03:12:02,270
with just everybody
falling down

4935
03:12:02,270 --> 03:12:03,700
and trying
to get back up.

4936
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:05,650
MATT: Well, if--

4937
03:12:07,100 --> 03:12:08,720
If you had fallen
into the lava,

4938
03:12:08,750 --> 03:12:11,500
by the way, if you
had rolled poorly,

4939
03:12:11,500 --> 03:12:14,000
you would have been submerged
in lava, which was...

4940
03:12:14,030 --> 03:12:15,600
LAURA: Unconscious.

4941
03:12:15,630 --> 03:12:19,630
MATT: Well, that-- that's
18d10 points of damage.

4942
03:12:19,660 --> 03:12:21,640
If that had exceeded
your max hit points,

4943
03:12:21,640 --> 03:12:24,000
you would have been instantly
dead and turned to ash.

4944
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,020
LIAM: Been nice if I'd
cut out her tongue.

4945
03:12:26,020 --> 03:12:27,460
LAURA: So, gone, gone-gone.

4946
03:12:27,460 --> 03:12:28,260
-MATT: Yeah.

4947
03:12:28,260 --> 03:12:30,150
There were a
few close calls there.

4948
03:12:30,150 --> 03:12:31,650
TRAVIS: She was like three.

4949
03:12:31,650 --> 03:12:33,150
I think there
were like nine.

4950
03:12:33,150 --> 03:12:34,390
MARISHA: Yeah.

4951
03:12:34,420 --> 03:12:37,730
LAURA: And then if you hadn't
counter spelled the color...

4952
03:12:37,730 --> 03:12:39,610
MATT: Oh, yeah, the
Prismatic Spray.

4953
03:12:39,610 --> 03:12:41,030
That would have
been real bad.

4954
03:12:41,060 --> 03:12:43,330
SAM: Who was she
shooting against?

4955
03:12:43,360 --> 03:12:45,540
-TALIESIN: Everybody.
-MARISHA: It's a spray.

4956
03:12:45,540 --> 03:12:46,870
MATT: It's a cone that big.

4957
03:12:46,870 --> 03:12:48,560
TALIESIN: So it would have
been almost everybody.

4958
03:12:48,560 --> 03:12:50,250
MATT: Just so you guys know,

4959
03:12:50,250 --> 03:12:52,480
cause it's a fun spell
to kind of talk about.

4960
03:12:52,480 --> 03:12:53,330
TALIESIN: It is.

4961
03:12:56,030 --> 03:12:58,220
MATT: And each of you
would have been hit

4962
03:12:58,220 --> 03:12:59,780
with a different
colored ray.

4963
03:12:59,810 --> 03:13:03,180
I would have rolled a d8
to see what color had hit you.

4964
03:13:03,210 --> 03:13:06,330
On a one, you take
10d6 fire damage.

4965
03:13:06,360 --> 03:13:08,000
On a failed save, half.

4966
03:13:08,030 --> 03:13:11,420
An orange, take 10d6 acid
damage, save for half.

4967
03:13:11,450 --> 03:13:14,870
Yellow: 10d6 lightning damage.

4968
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:16,630
So, just randomly
all of you guys

4969
03:13:16,660 --> 03:13:19,780
basically just take
10d6 of something.

4970
03:13:19,810 --> 03:13:22,480
Green: you take 10d6
poison damage, half save.

4971
03:13:22,510 --> 03:13:24,090
Five, 10d6 cold damage.

4972
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:26,630
Six, on a failed save,
you're restrained

4973
03:13:26,660 --> 03:13:29,300
and you have to keep making
saves or you turn to stone.

4974
03:13:29,330 --> 03:13:31,330
Seven, you're blinded

4975
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:33,790
and you have
to keep saving.

4976
03:13:35,220 --> 03:13:37,840
A successful save ends it,
if you fail the next save,

4977
03:13:37,870 --> 03:13:40,360
you will be transported
to another plane.

4978
03:13:40,390 --> 03:13:41,690
LAURA: What?!

4979
03:13:41,690 --> 03:13:43,990
SAM: There's one where you
get to do two things.

4980
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:45,720
MATT: On an eight, on an eight,

4981
03:13:45,750 --> 03:13:48,090
I roll again for two rays
against that person.

4982
03:13:48,120 --> 03:13:50,180
-LAURA: Oh my God!
-TRAVIS: For two rays?

4983
03:13:50,210 --> 03:13:51,510
SAM: What if you
keep rolling eights?

4984
03:13:51,540 --> 03:13:54,240
MATT: Keep rolling eights,
you're gonna be fucked.

4985
03:13:54,270 --> 03:13:55,240
It's a fun one.

4986
03:13:55,270 --> 03:13:56,480
I like that spell.

4987
03:13:56,510 --> 03:13:57,690
LAURA: Wait, what is a 10?

4988
03:13:57,720 --> 03:13:59,540
Is 10 insta-death,
what is 10?

4989
03:13:59,570 --> 03:14:03,000
MATT: It's one d8, so ten would be
instant death, it would be.

4990
03:14:03,030 --> 03:14:05,210
If I roll a
10 on a d8, sure.

4991
03:14:05,240 --> 03:14:07,210
You are so done.

4992
03:14:07,240 --> 03:14:08,750
TALIESIN: The other
plane of dimension

4993
03:14:08,780 --> 03:14:09,780
is like literally
the Beetlejuice,

4994
03:14:09,810 --> 03:14:11,420
like send you
to the sandworms.

4995
03:14:11,450 --> 03:14:13,240
You're just--

4996
03:14:13,270 --> 03:14:14,450
MATT: Oops.

4997
03:14:14,480 --> 03:14:16,520
TALIESIN: And that's-- you're
out of the fight

4998
03:14:16,520 --> 03:14:18,720
until they can go find
you if anyone's left.

4999
03:14:18,720 --> 03:14:21,210
After everyone else
has taken 10d-- suck.

5000
03:14:21,240 --> 03:14:25,450
MATT: So, guys, we'll pick this up
again next week on Thursday.

5001
03:14:25,480 --> 03:14:27,250
Find out
where Raishan is.

5002
03:14:27,250 --> 03:14:28,570
TRAVIS: Maybe.

5003
03:14:28,570 --> 03:14:31,620
MATT: With two eggs and the corpse
of Thordak, The Cinder King.

5004
03:14:31,620 --> 03:14:33,780
LAURA: Well, hopefully,
oh my God.

5005
03:14:33,810 --> 03:14:35,360
TALIESIN: Red eggs and ham?

5006
03:14:35,390 --> 03:14:37,730
TRAVIS: Yeah, she just escaped
with two Iphone 7's.

5007
03:14:37,730 --> 03:14:39,480
MATT: You start with
a disadvantage.

5008
03:14:39,510 --> 03:14:42,420
TALIESIN: I just want the internet to
do a Dr. Seuss red eggs and--

5009
03:14:42,450 --> 03:14:44,240
I just want her
with like a little

5010
03:14:44,270 --> 03:14:47,420
red steak and two little red--

5011
03:14:47,450 --> 03:14:49,000
That's all I want.

5012
03:14:49,030 --> 03:14:50,260
MATT: Alright, guys.

5013
03:14:50,260 --> 03:14:52,750
You guys, we'll see you
at MAGFest this weekend.

5014
03:14:52,780 --> 03:14:55,240
We'll see you
there shortly.

5015
03:14:55,270 --> 03:14:57,030
SAM: Remember, bring
your magazines

5016
03:14:57,060 --> 03:14:59,330
and have Matt and
Marisha sign any magazine.

5017
03:14:59,330 --> 03:15:00,540
TALIESIN: Highlights.

5018
03:15:00,540 --> 03:15:02,000
MARISHA: Yeah, all magazines.

5019
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:03,330
We will sign them.

5020
03:15:03,360 --> 03:15:05,650
LIAM: I mean, you're gonna say,
you don't know,

5021
03:15:05,650 --> 03:15:08,470
but if J'Mon had not nurked
those three attacks that round,

5022
03:15:08,470 --> 03:15:10,240
might she have gone down?

5023
03:15:10,240 --> 03:15:11,800
MATT: She came pretty close.

5024
03:15:11,800 --> 03:15:14,630
LAURA: Oh, yeah, if J'Mon had not
gotten three, two, one.

5025
03:15:14,660 --> 03:15:16,060
MATT: Three, two and a one.

5026
03:15:16,090 --> 03:15:17,270
MARISHA: That sucked.

5027
03:15:17,300 --> 03:15:18,870
MATT: That really sucked.

5028
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:22,270
MARISHA: I was about to lay some serious
damage when she ran away.

5029
03:15:22,300 --> 03:15:25,750
I was gonna bust out a seventh
level blight and then she ran.

5030
03:15:25,780 --> 03:15:29,220
MATT: I wasn't getting-- cause that
the fire breath is nasty.

5031
03:15:29,220 --> 03:15:31,400
MARISHA: Yeah, and he didn't
fucking recharge it.

5032
03:15:31,400 --> 03:15:34,450
TRAVIS: If your highness wasn't smart
enough to break another egg...

5033
03:15:34,450 --> 03:15:36,350
LAURA: I got to attack
one time that round.

5034
03:15:36,350 --> 03:15:38,690
Every other round was
just trying not to die.

5035
03:15:38,720 --> 03:15:41,190
LIAM: He should have stretched
before the fight.

5036
03:15:43,570 --> 03:15:46,160
-MATT: But anyway.
-MARISHA: Happy New Year.

5037
03:15:46,160 --> 03:15:47,560
MATT: Happy New Year!

5038
03:15:47,560 --> 03:15:49,030
Well done, guys,
you survived.

5039
03:15:49,030 --> 03:15:50,690
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Yay.

5040
03:15:50,690 --> 03:15:52,330
MATT: Mostly.

5041
03:15:52,360 --> 03:15:57,240
Thank you so much for our
sponsor tonight, nobody.

5042
03:15:57,270 --> 03:15:58,810
2017.

5043
03:15:58,840 --> 03:16:00,300
You guys
are our sponsors.

5044
03:16:00,330 --> 03:16:01,790
Well, every
week you are.

5045
03:16:01,790 --> 03:16:03,990
So thank you for all
your wonderful support.

5046
03:16:03,990 --> 03:16:06,570
Happy New Year, welcome
to the chaos of 2017.

5047
03:16:06,600 --> 03:16:09,270
We're there
alongside you for it.

5048
03:16:09,300 --> 03:16:10,840
We'll see you
guys soon and...

5049
03:16:10,870 --> 03:16:12,720
Is it Thursday yet?

5050
03:16:12,750 --> 03:16:13,810
Have a good night.

5051
