1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,646
BRIAN: Are we on the internet?

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:06,330
(cheering)

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,959
BRIAN: Good evening, and welcome to a very special
Thursday-evening edition of Talks Machina. For

4
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:17,025
those unfamiliar, my name is Brian W. Foster, and
I will be your host for most of the evening.

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:24,239
Tonight, we will be discussing episodes one
through 115 of Critical Role: The Adventures of

6
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:32,033
Vox Machina, with the entire cast of Critical
Role. We're going to laugh. We're going to cry.

7
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:38,584
We're going to wonder why we said what we did
tonight on Talks Machina. Porter, do the thing.

8
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:57,750
[upbeat music]

9
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,451
BRIAN: Welcome back. And welcome to the cast of
Critical Role.

10
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,920
SAM: Hi, Brian!

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,262
BRIAN: It's like deja vu, isn't it? It's like the
first time we've ever done this. Everyone looks so

12
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:14,797
beautiful and in the holiday spirit. I don't know
why because no one's wearing anything

13
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:19,367
Christmas-related. The spirit of the holidays is
among us.

14
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:20,612
LAURA: She's in green!

15
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,324
BRIAN: Oh, you are wearing green, aren't you?

16
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:23,795
MARISHA: It's festive.

17
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:30,028
BRIAN: Well, we did film this on St. Patrick's
Day, so. Before we get into discussing all those

18
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:33,980
wonderful episodes of Critical Role, we do have
some announcements on this wonderful Thursday

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:43,645
evening. First up, tonight's episode is sponsored
by Hearthstone. Their new expansion, Kobolds &amp;

20
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:49,269
Catacombs, is out now. Check out the link on the
screen to learn more. Also, the cast of Critical

21
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:54,411
Role did a special Kobolds &amp; Catacombs themed
one-shot a couple weeks back, which was super

22
00:01:54,411 --> 00:02:00,512
awesome and fun. Pretty rad. You can actually
check that out now on geekandsundry.com if you

23
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:07,129
missed it. Also, this Tuesday night will be our
Critmas episode. So tune in at 7:00pm Pacific for

24
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:12,450
our special Critmas episode of Talks Machina,
where we open gifts sent in for the cast members

25
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,829
and Sam throws up usually about 30 minutes in from
public drunkenness.

26
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,090
SAM: <i>Starts</i> throwing up.

27
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,161
BRIAN: Starts. Begins the process of throwing up.
It's sad. You were going to say?

28
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:26,616
MATT: It's a lot of things. I couldn't decide.

29
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:31,820
BRIAN: Also, there is no Critical Role next
Thursday, the 21st of December, but we are pleased

30
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:40,074
to announce that Critical Role will be back with a
brand new campaign starting January 11th. Yes! You

31
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:45,306
guys have a lot of homework to do and a lot of
stats to think about.

32
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,193
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:49,375
LIAM: I'll have to figure out how Assassinate
works.

34
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,878
BRIAN: Some of you could start learning the rules
of the game.

35
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,439
MATT: That'd be nice.

36
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:04,813
BRIAN: Well, stay tuned to the G&amp;S socials for all
those details. So, ladies and gentlemen, without

37
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:12,959
further ado, let's begin. Now, the way that we
have decided to break this up is we're going to

38
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,218
discuss the entire adventures of Vox Machina.
However, we know that it didn't begin with

39
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:26,060
Critical Role. Vox Machina actually began at a
home game, which was a version of Pathfinder. And

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,772
then for Critical Role it transferred into what
you guys are somehow getting away with calling

41
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:38,592
Dungeons and Dragons. So we have broken up the
show into five major arcs, beginning with the

42
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:43,838
first arc, which will cover episodes one through
23: Kraghammer and Vasselheim.

43
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:50,144
[musical crescendo]

44
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,794
BRIAN: All right. Our first question for the first
arc of the show is for anyone who wants to answer,

45
00:03:56,794 --> 00:04:04,363
except for Matt. This comes from @nerdyscotsman--
Yes it is. You can still say something if you

46
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:11,488
want. You're just not allowed to answer the
question. "Why did you all trust a mindflayer more

47
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,051
"than a holy paladin?"

48
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:15,718
LAURA: Because we're Vox Machina!

49
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:17,897
MARISHA: We were such assholes. Yeah.

50
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:19,645
TALIESIN: She's not a polite paladin.

51
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:23,003
LAURA: Well, everyone likes the underdog, right? I
mean, that's why.

52
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:26,849
TRAVIS: It's called the Underdark.

53
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,704
LAURA: I mean, he had been, you know, shunned by
the rest of them, so we thought he wanted to get

54
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,926
even.

55
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,338
TRAVIS: Plus you guys were super happy about what
you found.

56
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:36,537
LAURA: Yes, very much.

57
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,576
MARISHA: That was a good moment, man.

58
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:46,574
LAURA: But it didn't mean we didn't trust Kima! We
just also trusted (whispers) Clarota. Yeah.

59
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:48,366
SAM: He charmed us with his handsome good looks.

60
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:52,602
BRIAN: That's happened a few times over the
campaign, I think.

61
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:55,547
LIAM: We thought he was the diamond in the rough.
We thought he was the <i>one</i>, the one that was

62
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,140
different than them all.

63
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,433
BRIAN: Travis, tell me your thoughts. You're
shaking your head violently.

64
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:04,393
TRAVIS: I think I wrote, five weeks in a row on my
legal pad, "I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust

65
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:05,582
"Clarota."

66
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:10,920
MATT: Before you started chasing people with a
mallet? Yeah, sounds about right.

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,279
BRIAN: Matt, question for you from Jesse. "Was
there anything in the Underdark areas you made

68
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,198
"that the players missed or passed up? Encounters,
puzzles, or any other areas of interest?"

69
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:29,318
MATT: Yeah, there was the dwarven city around-- or
the duergar city around the Emberhold, which you

70
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:33,730
guys managed to circumvent for the most part. That
had some possible encounters there and social

71
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:45,232
elements. Then within Yug'Voril itself, the cavern
there, you saw the shimmer of a portal to the Far

72
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:46,260
Realm.

73
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,940
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's right!

74
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,889
MATT: The Far Realm is the place beyond known
space, where weird creatures come from.

75
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,017
LAURA: Could we have gone into that realm?

76
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:59,430
MATT: If you stepped through. That might not have
ended well.

77
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,962
LAURA: And we all would have just died!

78
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:03,985
TALIESIN: We would have gone so Star Trek or
something.

79
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:07,119
MARISHA: Would we have just died, or would it have
been a whole totally other campaign?

80
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,527
MATT: You know in Event Horizon, when they--?

81
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:14,791
LIAM: Was that in the little side cave where we
saw that?

82
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,161
MATT: Yeah, it was around the northern side of the
cavern of Yug'Voril. And then there was the actual

83
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:24,587
city around the pyramid. I had all this stuff
planned for you guys making your way through the

84
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:29,571
city and then multiple layers for the actual
pyramid, this upward dungeon crawl into the top

85
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,884
with the battle of K'Varn at the end. And you guys
went, "Let's just fly over and drop a giant on

86
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:35,330
"it!" So, that happened.

87
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,822
BRIAN: Incredible.

88
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:43,117
MARISHA: That was our little Polymorph trick,
right? We Polymorphed the giant and then dropped

89
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:45,384
it? That was fun.

90
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:52,702
BRIAN: Such babies then. I have a feeling there's
probably a lot of areas where stuff was missed and

91
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:54,262
they didn't get to.

92
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:57,799
MARISHA: Plus we had that flying carpet, which I
know you just <i>hated.</i>

93
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,975
LAURA: You didn't want us to have the carpet?

94
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:05,918
MATT: No, I gave it to you guys. And then I took
it away. And then I gave it back.

95
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:12,558
BRIAN: The DM giveth and the DM taketh away.
That's a T-shirt, right? It should be. Put Matt

96
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:20,873
Mercer's face on it and give me 10%. Our next
question is for Liam O'Brien, the actor most known

97
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:27,931
from this show for playing Vax. This is from
@animLae. "What info did you get from insight

98
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:29,646
"checking Keyleth?"

99
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,826
LAURA: Do you remember?

100
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:45,223
LIAM: I do. I do a little bit, yeah. The DM told
me that Keyleth seemed unsure and scared, if I'm

101
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:53,441
remembering right, and feeling cut off from
topside. And it might've been the first time--

102
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:59,462
Like, the twins, all throughout the home game and
the beginning of the show, I think our most common

103
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:06,632
shared response to a lot of your decisions was,
like-- And it was the first moment where I stopped

104
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,351
doing that.

105
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:09,722
MARISHA: Interesting.

106
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,331
BRIAN: Stopped insight checking her?

107
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,339
LAURA: No, stopped questioning.

108
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:21,135
LIAM: I don't know. Something about being on the
show and the way Matt-- Whatever he phrased into

109
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:24,852
my ear made me look at your character in a new
way.

110
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:34,779
MARISHA: Aw, felt bad for little derpy Keyleth?
Felt a little bad? Just a little? What was the

111
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,935
turning point? I don't think I've ever asked you
this question. What was the turning point when you

112
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,863
were like, oh, maybe Vax has a crush-y?

113
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:49,333
LIAM: It might've been that. I don't know if it
was that. It was after that. I stopped being so

114
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:54,508
snarky 100% of the time, which allowed me to have
different, I don't know--

115
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:57,646
MARISHA: Like every other adolescent male, you
stopped being an asshole and then realized--?

116
00:08:57,646 --> 00:09:07,666
BRIAN: At what age do you stop being that? Because
I still am that, I'm pretty sure. Travis, you and

117
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:13,995
I are the prime examples of that. Marisha, save us
from Travis's face with an answer to this question

118
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:21,590
from Synchroraven. "Can you delve into your own and
Keyleth's insights on that vision she spoke of

119
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,160
"having when she met the Earth Ashari?"

120
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,185
MARISHA: Okay. My insights?

121
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:30,974
BRIAN: Your own and Keyleth's insights, if you
can.

122
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:40,453
MARISHA: Well, that was right after I killed the
kid. Yeah. The first one.

123
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:43,032
SAM: You never forget your first.

124
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:47,193
(laughter)

125
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:56,815
MARISHA: Because that was also one of the first
big character-type changing moments that happened

126
00:09:56,815 --> 00:10:02,598
in our pre-stream game. I remember talking to you
about it and you were like, "You should probably

127
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:08,416
"think about how this is going to affect Keyleth.
You snapped a kid's neck." And I was like, aw,

128
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:16,479
shit. Now I've got to own this. And so she
basically was really depressed after that and had

129
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:21,950
lost herself and had continued on into her
Aramente, where she went to the Earth kingdom and

130
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,446
was having a hard time basically functioning or
fighting or doing any type of magic or

131
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:39,109
nature-shifting. So the vision ended up being my
way of writing in her own epiphany. And it was

132
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:48,689
more or less to represent the consequences of
inaction. In that vision, I considered her to see

133
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:58,531
her death. At the time it was so early that it was
supposed to be a-- not meaning to be something to

134
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:07,291
ever come to fruition ever, but yeah. It was
supposed to be her lesson to herself that you

135
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,128
figure it out or die.

136
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,656
BRIAN: One of the first of many lessons like that,
I think, she was going to have. What was the

137
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:21,710
biggest difference, switching from the home game
to streaming? Did you guys change anything about

138
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,668
your characters? Obviously you changed the ruleset
and stuff like that. Was there anything about your

139
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:30,413
characters in the home game that you didn't want
to bring into the stream, or you chose not to, or

140
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:35,227
that you changed? Or did it pretty much just,
smoothly, you carried everything over?

141
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,967
TALIESIN: Yeah, I didn't feel anything.

142
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:42,119
LAURA: I feel like, that was one of the biggest
things when we switched over and we started

143
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:47,107
filming the show, was we didn't want anything to
change from the home game.

144
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,804
BRIAN: It was important to keep that?

145
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:49,963
LAURA: Yeah.

146
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:55,105
MATT: Some abilities changed from the systems a
little bit. A little bit of re-learning elements

147
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,266
of the classes and stuff like that.

148
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,613
MARISHA: And we changed our name.

149
00:11:58,613 --> 00:11:59,971
LAURA: Yeah, from the S.H.I.T.s.

150
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:05,453
BRIAN: Biggest regret so far? Changing the name
from the S.H.I.T.s?

151
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:11,973
MATT: Technically, Vox Machina, the name was taken
during the ceremony in which Sovereign Tal'Dorei

152
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:14,735
had a giant parade for you guys.

153
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,794
LAURA: We had a reason for it because we knew we
were going to be starting this stream.

154
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:22,333
TALIESIN: I think we would've changed the name
anyway because we were making the noise of, "Do we

155
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:27,052
"want to be known as the S.H.I.T.s? Because we have
to start making a decision." But even in-game we

156
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:31,096
were like, "Are we the S.H.I.T.s or are we--?"

157
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:34,390
BRIAN: Did anyone vote to stay the S.H.I.T.s?

158
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,385
SAM: I wanted to stay the S.H.I.T.s.

159
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,591
BRIAN: My man.

160
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:42,775
MARISHA: Yeah, it ended up being more of an RP
thing from Taliesin and Keyleth-- or, Keyleth and

161
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:50,030
Percy's perspective, because we both were the ones
from royalty. I had a goal.

162
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,496
MATT: They were asked, "We're going to present you
before the people of Emon as the celebration and

163
00:12:54,496 --> 00:13:00,850
"thanks for you helping us through this difficult
time. How would you like to be announced?" And it

164
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,101
was that moment of, "Give us a-- We need to
talk."

165
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:08,043
TRAVIS: It was Pike, Scanlan, and Grog were the
ones who were like, "That's a good name. We'll

166
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,713
"keep it that way."

167
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:12,496
TALIESIN: And it was the two of us who were going,
"Absolutely fucking not."

168
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:17,195
LIAM: There is a little bit of a historical record
of it, though, because there is that video

169
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:22,052
floating around of you breaking the news to us. And
your question after he finishes telling his story

170
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,879
is, "Do we have to change our name from the
S.H.I.T.s?" And you have Travis from off going,

171
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,997
"No deal! No deal!"

172
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:31,924
MATT: Yeah, that might've been right around that
same time when all that went down.

173
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:39,246
BRIAN: That's hilarious. Matt, question from
TiamatZX. "What ultimately made Clar-ah-ta turn on

174
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:40,481
"the party?"

175
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:41,588
MARISHA: Clar-ah-ta?

176
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:45,062
BRIAN: I'm joking. Remember earlier when I asked
for the correct pronunciation so that I could do

177
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:52,498
the opposite? "What ultimately made Clarota turn on
the party? Was it already planned or was there a

178
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:56,612
"chance he wouldn't, only for his free will to be
overridden by the Elder Brain?"

179
00:13:56,612 --> 00:14:08,188
MATT: It would've had to have been a lot of work
to try and appeal to Clarota and convince him that

180
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:15,340
his separation from the Elder Brain and his people
is a permanent thing and now he could accept new

181
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,001
society, new friends. But that would've taken a
lot of role play.

182
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:23,713
LAURA: He's like Hugh in Star Trek, from the Borg!
I loved Hugh.

183
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:26,657
MATT: Kind of, I guess you could say! But it
would've taken a lot. It was possible, but because

184
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:31,621
at the time it was, well, he'll help us and then
push along! For him, it was just survival. I mean,

185
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:37,129
him even allying with you guys was purely out of
your initial social confrontation with him and

186
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:40,666
being like, "Whoa, we're okay! We're not going to
hurt you!" And he's like, "Okay, I can survive

187
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,161
"with these guys. I will convince them I'm a
friend. They will take me to where I want to go

188
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:49,094
"and maybe, if I free my people from this influence
and free the Elder Brain from the influence of

189
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:50,752
"K'Varn, they'll take me back."

190
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:56,028
LIAM: And you've got to imagine being linked into
that Elder Brain system probably feels real good.

191
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:02,026
MATT: Oh, yeah. Well, an alhoon, which is an
illithid who has arcane capabilities like that, is

192
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,564
shunned forever, and is told you can never be part
of the Elder Brain connection again. It's like

193
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:11,232
being unplugged from your hive mind. And so for
him, once he reconnected, it was-- yeah. There was

194
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:12,467
no coming back.

195
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,709
BRIAN: It's like when I left Scientology.
Taliesin...

196
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,169
TALIESIN: You left?

197
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:20,002
LIAM: You <i>think</i> when you left. You think.

198
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,184
(laughter)

199
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:26,807
BRIAN: Oh, man. I cannot wait just to see the art
of Liam's beard. Every time Liam grows a beard,

200
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:33,286
Tumblr goes insane. It's the best. I spend way too
many nights on there looking up all the fanfic of

201
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:38,399
Liam's beard. Taliesin, question for you from
@JoustingJose...

202
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,883
(laughter, cheers)

203
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:43,106
TALIESIN: Solid name.

204
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:47,944
BRIAN: "Did Percy worry about 'flashing' his name,
knowing that the Briarwoods were still around? How

205
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:52,885
"come the Tal'dorei council didn't connect him with
Whitestone, having heard that he is a de Rolo?"

206
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:59,254
TALIESIN: He was flashing-- again, Percy spent
almost the entire game in the midst of an intense

207
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:05,289
nervous breakdown. And he was specifically
flashing his name almost like running around

208
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:10,643
saying, "I'm Superman!", looking for Lex Luthor.
So he was kind of trying to put feelers out there

209
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:19,559
to let people know who he was and what was
happening. Whitestone... I feel like they knew

210
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,234
that he came from Whitestone. I just felt that
news of what had happened in Whitestone hadn't

211
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,688
really processed through the kingdom.

212
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:32,265
MATT: Yeah. Everything that happened to the de
Rolos was kept close internally. Information got

213
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:36,298
out about the Briarwoods currently running the
space, there was that the de Rolos got very ill,

214
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:41,868
the family all died off, and these friends came to
power to continue their legacy. And that was the

215
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:48,188
story that was suffused throughout Tal'Dorei,
beyond the city's limits. So whenever they heard

216
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:52,558
"de Rolo," either they think, "Well, he's crazy,"
or maybe he's a relative. But they weren't very

217
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:53,858
politically connected.

218
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:57,692
TALIESIN: They wouldn't even necessarily know
that... who knows the name of the royal family of

219
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,895
Nova Scotia? Unless you need to.

220
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,613
BRIAN: Well, Sam does. Right? It's the Berkin? The
Berchins...

221
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:04,932
SAM: Scotians.

222
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:06,039
BRIAN: The Scotians. Ah, yes.

223
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,252
TALIESIN: The New England Scotians.

224
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:09,379
SAM: Daryl and Hannah Scotian.

225
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:13,096
MARISHA: Wait, Daryl and Hannah?

226
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:14,619
BRIAN: That's what he said!

227
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,196
TALIESIN: Daryl and Hannah. That's pretty
fantastic.

228
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:18,785
LIAM: Just a skosh.

229
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:24,318
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was intentional, and he was
fine whether people believed it or not. It was

230
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,687
more for him than it was for anybody else, just to
build himself up into this notion of a superhero.

231
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:33,017
BRIAN: Yeah, absolutely. And it worked.

232
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:34,318
TALIESIN: Too well.

233
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:38,945
BRIAN: Too well, yeah. Ashley! Stay awake with an
answer...

234
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:41,670
(laughter)

235
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,409
BRIAN: Thank you for joining us right after a very
long day working on ABC's Blindside. See that

236
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:57,733
every Sunday at 2 p.m. on CBS. Make sure to watch
that show. Ashley: this question comes from

237
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:00,241
VexMeUpBeforeYouGoGo.

238
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:05,806
(laughter, singing along)

239
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:11,091
BRIAN: "I don't think you ever went into detail
about what Pike had been doing on her time off,

240
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,661
"just that she was on the seas. Can you elaborate
on that for us?"

241
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:27,543
ASHLEY: Oh, boy. Well, I knew that after... I
guess when we found out that when we were going to

242
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:40,535
start streaming the show and after Pike had died
in our home games, I had talked to everybody about

243
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:51,948
wanting to have Pike be a little bit stronger and
get a little bit more strength, so when she was in

244
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:58,678
battle she could fight and offer a little bit more
to the fight than just healing, which is still

245
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:10,644
important. So I think-- this is a roundabout answer, but
I think I wanted her to spend some time at sea and

246
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:19,732
on the Broken Howl and on a boat just basically
doing simple boat work. Getting her strength.

247
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:31,277
BRIAN: Maybe some of you guys know this, but
Ashley lived on a boat for a while as a kid, so

248
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:34,042
she knows her way around a boat, too.

249
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,100
MARISHA: I didn't know that!

250
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,869
BRIAN: Yeah, they lived on a boat for a little
bit, out in the marina. She knows how to tie a

251
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:45,452
couple different... Windsor knots? I don't--

252
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,944
(laughter)

253
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:49,838
TALIESIN: Can you do a monkey's fist? That's my
favorite knot.

254
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,100
BRIAN: I'm terrified of water. I'm not allowed to
go anywhere near the boats.

255
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,909
TALIESIN: You sprout more Brians if you get wet,
is that it?

256
00:19:54,909 --> 00:20:02,042
BRIAN: I wish! Set up a franchise, take over, then
host all the aftershows. Ashley, was there more

257
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,589
you wanted to add to that, or do you feel--

258
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:10,678
ASHLEY: That's pretty much it. Honestly, it was
one of those things where when we knew we were

259
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:15,626
going to be on the stream, I was like, Okay, this
was what I wanted to have done on my time off, and

260
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:22,987
because of my background on boats, I was like,
"Let's make her a little bit of a sailor!" But

261
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:30,001
honestly, I don't think she had a very exciting
life on the boat, other than getting pretty

262
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:30,938
swole.

263
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,615
LAURA: How'd you get the scar, though? You had a
scar on the boat.

264
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:33,557
SAM: Yeah, the scar!

265
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:35,009
ASHLEY: Was the scar from that time?

266
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:35,919
LAURA: Yeah!

267
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:36,999
ASHLEY: I thought I'd already had it!

268
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:37,937
LAURA: No!

269
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,840
SAM: Also, didn't you fall in love with some dude
on the boat?

270
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,935
ASHLEY: No!

271
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:41,870
SAM: Oh.

272
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,870
MARISHA: She fell in love before, and then went on
the boat.

273
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,226
LIAM: Next question...

274
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:49,808
SAM: I didn't know that. Get to the good stuff.
Forget the boat stuff, Brian, get to the <i>love</i>

275
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:50,829
stuff.

276
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:54,128
BRIAN: We're going to get there, we're going to
get there. I don't want-- the people will tune out

277
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:58,726
the second they get those answers, so we're going
to tease them a little bit. Because that's why

278
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:06,957
people came here. Laura, question for you from
@frankelstein_. "Constantly Percy had to craft

279
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:13,162
"more bullets, but never did we see Vex fletch
arrows or go out and buy them. Why was that? Was

280
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:17,072
"it just an assumed-between-episodes thing? And if
so, why not the same for Percy?"

281
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:21,220
LAURA: No, that happened before the stream. We
just had--

282
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,792
MATT: Well, two reasons on this. One, bullets
don't exist in this world, really, outside of

283
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:31,340
Percival and eventually some elements, so you
<i>have</i> to make them. There's no other way to get

284
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,120
them. Whereas arrows, you can buy them anywhere.
But even before the stream happened, once you guys

285
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,786
got hold of a Bag of Holding, you went and
bought... I think it was a thousand arrows and

286
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:42,356
just threw them in the bag.

287
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:46,572
And at that point, I was like, "All right, don't
worry about it. We're fine."

288
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:51,129
LAURA: I think towards the end of the campaign you
were like, "You may be running low on arrows."

289
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:52,062
MATT: Yeah.

290
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,152
LAURA: "What?!"

291
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:58,885
MATT: But yeah. At that point they were so cheap,
and you guys had enough money in the bank that it

292
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,984
was like, "I'll just not have to worry about this
<i>ever</i> again."

293
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:08,577
BRIAN: Liam, you touched on this earlier, but
@shardee asks, "You've said before that the first

294
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:13,181
"time Vax realized he had feelings for Keyleth was
during a moment in the Underdark. What was that

295
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,460
"moment?"

296
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,971
LIAM: Well, I don't really know. The ball might
have started rolling from that whisper. I think

297
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:26,444
that's probably likely. But I don't know where it
happened. I do remember-- what's going on, Laura?

298
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:27,871
SAM: She's picking your nose.

299
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,395
LIAM: (exaggerated sneeze)

300
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:30,929
(laughter)

301
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:36,743
LIAM: I do remember the months, though, playing
the game and having that secret. It was a home

302
00:22:36,743 --> 00:22:40,273
game, it was a secret. I wasn't thinking of
telegraphing it or leaving breadcrumbs or tipping

303
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:45,228
anybody off. And I didn't know if I was going to
admit anything, so I thought, "Well, I'll just do

304
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:50,525
"the little things that I'm doing here, quietly,
and then either someday spill it or not." And I

305
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:55,523
wasn't going to let anything out as soon as I did,
but when that thing with the Briarwoods happened,

306
00:22:55,523 --> 00:23:00,370
I thought he was gone. So I was like, "Well, he's
dying. So I'm going to let it out here. Oh, he's

307
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,587
"not dead. Uh--" (sucks in a breath) And I'll pull
it back in.

308
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:05,670
MARISHA: Plus, you know, Kash kind of beat you to
the punch a little bit.

309
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,045
LAURA: Yeah, he did.

310
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:15,581
LIAM: Sure, and again, still had all that stuff
brewing in my head for months after the Kash kiss,

311
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:17,888
and didn't want to show my hand.

312
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:20,294
TALIESIN: Kash kiss.

313
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:21,723
SAM: Good reality show.

314
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:23,073
BRIAN: Supposed to be Cash Cab, yeah.

315
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:25,456
MATT: (announcer voice) Season three of Kash Kiss, on
TLC.

316
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,365
(laughter)

317
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,414
BRIAN: You might have just gotten your job as the
narrator.

318
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:31,232
MATT: Oh, God. Yes.

319
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:39,355
BRIAN: Travis. Question for you from...
(mispronounces) Myrnorunshot? Whatever. "We never

320
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:42,406
"heard about Grog's mother? Did he know her at all?
Is she dead or alive?"

321
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:50,517
TRAVIS: Oh. Grog has no idea Yeah. I mean, Grog's
idea of family, I think, growing up, was just his

322
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:53,525
father, Stonejaw Strongjaw...

323
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:59,114
(laughter)

324
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:05,064
TRAVIS: ...and like the herd. The herd was the
family as a whole. And in my mind, the Herd of

325
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:10,454
Storms was just kinda like, free love, man. You
just hook up with who you hook up with, and then

326
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:14,812
you get kids, and then you just teach them how to
fight, and send them out into the wilderness, and

327
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:20,533
they eat a deer with their bare hands, and then...
you just move on to Tuesday. Yeah, he just never

328
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:26,497
really... I don't think he ever really figured out
who Mom was, and I don't think it was until he met

329
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:32,974
Pike and everything and understood what a loving,
nurturing, caring family was about that didn't

330
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:38,323
involve knuckles in your face, that he might have
even started to wonder, "Hey, who gave birth to

331
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:43,417
"me, and why did I never have a nurturer?" It never
really occurred to him.

332
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,333
BRIAN: Yeah, interesting.

333
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,628
ASHLEY: I forgot that was your dad's name.

334
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:51,246
(laughter)

335
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:58,137
ASHLEY: Stonejaw Strong...jaw!

336
00:24:58,137 --> 00:25:01,530
TRAVIS: To be fair, I didn't make that-- did you
make that? Did I? I did make that name up.

337
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,037
MATT and SAM: You made it up!

338
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:04,018
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right.

339
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:05,721
MARISHA: But I think it was before you had a last
name, right?

340
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,993
MATT: No, because he had a last name, but I think
when he made up the name of his dad, they weren't

341
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:13,166
using last names a lot in the game. He said it
once at the beginning, and it never came up for a

342
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:18,362
long time, and so then Stonejaw came out, and
eventually the two points connected and marvelous

343
00:25:18,362 --> 00:25:20,299
times were had.

344
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:21,977
(laughter)

345
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:23,594
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right on course.

346
00:25:23,594 --> 00:25:25,370
LIAM: And we had to go deal with Stonejaw--

347
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,114
TRAVIS: That's right, you dealt with him when I
wasn't there! That's right.

348
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:29,513
LAURA: Yeah, we had to deal with--

349
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:31,955
TRAVIS: Thanks for that. He was a bitch.

350
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:34,346
(laughter)

351
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:37,526
BRIAN: Thanks for that help all those years ago.
Matt, something that a lot of people wanted to

352
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:42,935
know, from Shandraa: "Who was the anonymous person
who took out the contract on the rakshasa?"

353
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:51,659
MATT: Oh! Interesting. That would have been, I
believe, one of the members of the Arcana

354
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,595
Pansophical. Which member was it?

355
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,544
TRAVIS: I don't know what he just said.

356
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:02,177
MARISHA: That was most definitely a thing in our
game. That definitely was a thing.

357
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,233
(laughter)

358
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,226
MATT: I've mentioned it a couple of times, but the
only person you've really dealt with from the

359
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:06,113
Arcana--

360
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:08,158
LAURA: Was the guy with the purple hair, right?
Was he Arcana Pansophical?

361
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,750
MARISHA: Yeah, we've dealt with a few people from
it.

362
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,020
MATT: Yeah. Well, Allura's a member.

363
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,181
ALL: Oh yeah!

364
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:14,587
LAURA: Obviously! (laughs)

365
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:20,068
MATT: So was Drake Thunderbrand and a few other
people. But it was one of the members there. And

366
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:24,974
the idea was they were working on developing some
sort of a portal that connected to the Hells and

367
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:30,685
they needed demon parts and they'd found there was
a rakshasa that was in the space of the area, and

368
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:37,917
was kind of a twofer deal. Weed it out and also
harvest parts from it that I could use as part of

369
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:42,339
this ritual. Not really understanding or caring
that whoever killed it would be locked into a

370
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:46,228
cycle of revenge with whoever it was. But that's
why you pay people to do it for you, because now

371
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:47,715
the vengeance isn't on you!

372
00:26:47,715 --> 00:26:48,853
BRIAN: Absolutely.

373
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:49,861
MATT: Oh, mages.

374
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:51,025
TALIESIN: Money well spent.

375
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:56,163
BRIAN: I have to say we are going back not just a
long ways in time, but a long ways in the journey

376
00:26:56,163 --> 00:27:00,394
of these characters and I'm surprised at how well
everyone's doing with remembering a lot of this

377
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:01,135
stuff!

378
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:02,374
MATT: So are we!

379
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:06,354
BRIAN: I didn't want to send everybody the
questions beforehand because, you know, the FCC

380
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:14,215
and we've all seen Quiz Show. Popular 1994 film
directed by Robert Redford.

381
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:23,274
Now Matt, you brought up Allura a second ago.
MishapMaster13 says, "When Kima was introduced, was

382
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:28,285
"the relationship with Allura already planned out,
or did that evolve in response to the party and

383
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:29,478
"the community?"

384
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:34,419
MATT: No. That was part of the character's plan to
develop them, as far as a past history. I didn't

385
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:40,087
know if it was going to become a reconciliation,
or like we once had a fling, but now we're just

386
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:46,477
friends doing our own thing. And the first time
you guys even heard of Kima was maybe the second

387
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:50,017
session when you were looking for Grog in
Westruun. And back then I was like, she would have

388
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:54,226
had this past history with this mage character
I'll introduce down the road during the campaign.

389
00:27:54,226 --> 00:28:00,087
But when I developed the whole Underdark arc I was
like, Okay, they're still good friends, they still

390
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:04,184
care about each other even though their lives are
separate, and then that reunion was what

391
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:10,603
re-sparked it. You guys retrieving Kima, and the
idea of losing one another on her pilgrimage was

392
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:13,965
what began to rekindle that process for the two of
them.

393
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:19,958
BRIAN: Did you have any idea that those two
characters would become as beloved as they have

394
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,149
been to the fan base?

395
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:27,611
MATT: No, I had no idea! And once again, you don't
know what to expect, what magical combinations of

396
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:33,778
characters and people make for good storytelling,
and what people will cling onto. And they became

397
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:38,201
as important to a lot of other people as they were
to me, as it progressed. I didn't expect them to

398
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:42,375
be so impactful to me, either. You know, Allura
eventually became, as we all realized, a

399
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:47,729
self-insertion into the story at times. And yeah,
it was cool to just watch it evolve.

400
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:48,869
BRIAN: Yeah.

401
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:53,290
LIAM: Gosh, I mean, two shopkeeps are beloved on
this show, Gilmore and Victor.

402
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,489
BRIAN: Yeah, that's true.

403
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:55,559
LAURA: Good ol' Victor.

404
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,186
(laughter)

405
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:59,240
BRIAN: Marisha.

406
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,170
MARISHA: Yes.

407
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:06,059
BRIAN: Question about Keyleth's antlers. Before I
get to that, did you ever have any idea that that

408
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:09,981
would be such a thing? That that would become such
an iconic, sort of--

409
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,558
MARISHA: No, not at all.

410
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:18,386
BRIAN: Well, Smokeontheraze wants to know:
"Keyleth has had the antlers since day once and

411
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:24,431
"never took them off, sometimes getting defensive
about them. Is there a story behind the antlers?"

412
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:32,532
MARISHA: She had a circlet, in our home game. She
had a circlet that I kind of looped into-- was one

413
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:40,044
of the last relics from her mom and her Ashari
tribe that she took with us-- or, with her. You

414
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,425
get what I'm saying.

415
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:47,148
And then Kit was the one who drew it as the
antlers. I told Kit, I was like, She's got a dope

416
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:52,570
circlet. And that was about all I told Kit. And
then it came back with antlers, and I was like,

417
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,909
Oh, I love this!

418
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:58,667
LAURA: Yeah. So much of the original
characterizations came from Kit. Like the

419
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,089
feathers? That wasn't me, that was her.

420
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:03,831
BRIAN: Oh, interesting.

421
00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:07,461
LAURA: All these little things that ended up
becoming so--

422
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:08,377
BRIAN: Iconic.

423
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:09,423
LAURA: Yeah. With our characters.

424
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:11,921
LIAM: Yeah, a lot of little things came up just by
chance or from art, and then we wove them

425
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:19,032
backwards in time into the story. So much happens
by accident. And that's the magic of the game.

426
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:21,476
BRIAN: Taliesin, did Percy have glasses in your
mind, or was that--

427
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:26,918
TALIESIN: Uh, yes. Yes he did, although they
weren't quite as complicated as when Kit came out

428
00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:32,739
with the four-lens. That was like, oh wow, that's
wonderfully complicated and impractical, I love it!

429
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,302
(laughter)

430
00:30:34,302 --> 00:30:38,350
BRIAN: Makes for such cool cosplay, though, and
art. Matt.

431
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,348
MATT: Yes?

432
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:43,953
BRIAN: Ickulus wants to know: "I believe you
mentioned that the Thunderbrands were supposed to

433
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:48,895
"end up as allies or a bigger part of the story if
the initial encounter had gone differently. What

434
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:50,452
"did we end up missing there?"

435
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:55,252
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, the Thunderbrands I designed
to be kind of an ally in the journey into the

436
00:30:55,252 --> 00:31:00,719
Underdark. The idea is when you converse with
them, there is a story with a family member who is

437
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:05,118
lost in the Underdark, and if you guys had brought it
up and discussed with them, like we're going down

438
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:10,325
there, it's dangerous, can you be of any aid, they
would either provide some equipment and possibly

439
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:15,026
send somebody along with you who would be kind of
a guide into the Underdark. One of the

440
00:31:15,026 --> 00:31:16,401
Thunderbrand mages.

441
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:18,125
LAURA: Oh man!

442
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,277
TRAVIS: Liam would have probably killed that--

443
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,265
(laughter)

444
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:23,165
LIAM: No no, that lost relative went on to be the
nothic that I shanked underground.

445
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,430
(laughter)

446
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,725
MATT: Yeah, you eventually found the necklace that
was part of that thread, which was eventually

447
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:35,695
returned to House Thunderbrand. But yeah, instead
of that, you guys and Tiberius-- and once you guys

448
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:39,532
walked out to the front of the house, and attacked
their wards with spells, and then got in their

449
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:43,584
face at the door, and then Scanlan turned
invisible and snuck inside for no reason, and--

450
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:45,495
(laughter)

451
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:46,474
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right!

452
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:48,132
LAURA: That was the first time you went
invisible!

453
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:49,805
TRAVIS: You went invisible and we were like
(screams).

454
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:52,051
MATT: So that thread didn't continue (laughs).

455
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:53,472
BRIAN: Yeah.

456
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:54,426
LAURA: Wow.

457
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:57,302
MATT: But yeah, it would have been just, like, an
alliance that would have led to some possible

458
00:31:57,302 --> 00:32:00,927
bonuses in equipment options and possibly an ally
to guide you through the Underdark, but...

459
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:01,836
LAURA: Damn.

460
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,616
MARISHA: Whoops.

461
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,050
LAURA: I wonder how many times we've fucked that
up. Like, different relationships, huh?

462
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,013
TRAVIS: Every week?

463
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:06,954
TALIESIN: Every week.

464
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:07,943
MATT: (laughs)

465
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:08,985
LAURA: A lot of times.

466
00:32:08,985 --> 00:32:10,093
BRIAN: Every single time.

467
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:11,388
TALIESIN: Every week is a friend we never will
make.

468
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,035
LIAM: Next campaign will be better, next campaign
will be better.

469
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:15,171
OTHERS: Sure! (laughter)

470
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:16,473
TRAVIS: We'll get it all right.

471
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:18,597
BRIAN: We're going to be saying that for the next
couple of weeks. Matt--

472
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:20,699
LIAM: Optimized, our combat decisions will be
optimized.

473
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:21,614
SAM: Yep.

474
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:22,546
MATT: Sure...

475
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:24,638
LAURA: Next campaign, still a bunch of dicks!

476
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:25,814
BRIAN: Streamlined!

477
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:26,738
MARISHA: Yeah.

478
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:31,491
BRIAN: After we roll initiative everybody knows
what they want to do. Matt, Payattention007

479
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,591
asks--

480
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:35,494
(laughter)

481
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:38,984
BRIAN: "How did a sphinx come to be hidden beneath
Vasselheim?"

482
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:47,934
MATT: That's an interesting point. So, Ioun and
the Knowing Mistress and the following there is a

483
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:54,148
belief that knowledge and the dissemination of
knowledge is of paramount importance to elevate

484
00:32:54,148 --> 00:33:03,354
and teach people about history, about lore, about
truth. And when she was wounded and when her

485
00:33:03,354 --> 00:33:10,119
following was largely culled during the Calamity,
and then shortly after the Divergence, they had to

486
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,499
go into hiding. So the followers of Ioun outside
of the Cobalt Reserve, which are like the most

487
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:20,385
prominent members of them but they are well
protected by the governments, including Osysa,

488
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:26,839
they had to go into hiding and in doing so kind
of-- I imagine almost like those truth groups

489
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:32,490
that find secret information and then disseminate
it to the press: this is the truth about this, and

490
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,485
kind of reveal and whistle-blow certain things.
That's kind of how a lot of Ioun's followers have

491
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:40,312
to work in society. Because if they reveal
themselves, there are a lot of darker elements that

492
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:44,715
will hunt them down and try and destroy them.
Followers of Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion, and

493
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:49,847
other individuals that want to see this wounded
god eventually taken away. So Osysa has long been

494
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:55,946
an agent of Ioun's will and they needed a bastion
of that in Vasselheim, and so the creation of the

495
00:33:55,946 --> 00:34:01,524
Slayer's Take was all a cover, in a way, of
ingraining that within Vasselheim society. And

496
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:07,137
Osysa needs to stay hidden to be that heart of the
information network for the followers of Ioun in

497
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:09,490
that part of the countryside of Issylra.

498
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,343
BRIAN: Can you believe he holds all this in his
head?

499
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:12,290
(murmured agreement)

500
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,496
TRAVIS: That just blows my mind.

501
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:16,818
BRIAN: Watching Travis's face I'm like yeah,
that's how I feel, that's how I feel.

502
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:19,080
(laughter)

503
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,609
BRIAN: Last question for this arc and then we're
going to move on. Matt, from Telepickups, "Where

504
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:26,217
"was the other Horn of Orcus, and could the players
have found it?"

505
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:27,592
TRAVIS: Good question!

506
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:28,965
LAURA: Wait, can we know that? We can't know
that!

507
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:31,196
MATT: Actually, you shouldn't know that, because
it's still in the world!

508
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,387
LAURA: Ah!

509
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:33,692
BRIAN: Oh, wow.

510
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:37,399
MATT: There might be some questions that I can't
answer because they might-- and I'm not saying

511
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,930
they will pertain to the next campaign, but they
might. The other Horn of Orcus does exist in the

512
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:47,974
world, as there are a number of other artifacts
and vestiges that--

513
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:49,721
LAURA: It's underneath Dalen's Closet.

514
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:53,341
MATT: Yeah. It's right in the sand there. It's two
feet deep, some kid's going to find it on

515
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,268
vacation.

516
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:55,460
(laughter)

517
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,078
MARISHA: Just need a metal detector. Beep beep!

518
00:34:57,078 --> 00:35:02,906
BRIAN: Yeah, just a retired guy with a metal
detector. At the end of each arc, we're going to

519
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:08,807
give some CritRoleStats that cover the whole
campaign, given to us by our friends at

520
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:17,785
CritRoleStats. Up first, we're going to talk about
rolls. The total rolls for the campaign: 10,819.

521
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:19,349
MATT: That's crazy!

522
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:21,696
MARISHA: The fact that they counted them! How?

523
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:26,126
BRIAN: And they all have real jobs and real lives.
It's not like they're just sitting at home doing

524
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:35,726
all this. They're just really smart. Total nat 20s
including Doty's Matt crit, 548.

525
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:36,849
TRAVIS: Damn!

526
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:42,565
BRIAN: Nat 20s. Yeah. Taliesin only cheated on a
few.

527
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:44,143
TALIESIN: Only a few.

528
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:49,565
BRIAN: Total nat ones. Do you think it's higher or
lower than nat 20s?

529
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:50,668
LAURA: Lower.

530
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:52,095
SAM: Way lower because some of us--

531
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:54,540
LAURA: We have advantage and Luck.

532
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:01,967
BRIAN: 497 versus 548. It's really close. What was
that, Liam?

533
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:05,025
LIAM: You get to reroll things. What was it?
Burning a grit or something?

534
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:07,001
MATT: He gives himself advantage on attack rolls.

535
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:09,797
LIAM: That's still rolls.

536
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:12,505
MARISHA: He eventually critted on a 19.

537
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:17,381
MATT: You did have Indomitable where you can
reroll saving throws as well.

538
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:21,729
LIAM: So Luck is all-purpose, but that was like a
more-limited version of.

539
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:36,972
BRIAN: Per player. Let's look at the most nat 20s.
Oh no. Top two. Vax: 107. Percy: 104. Beat you by

540
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:41,720
a few. Most nat ones: Vex. 76!

541
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,158
LAURA: Oh shit, really?!

542
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:49,835
TRAVIS: That's what you get for having all of
those fucking dice! Time to cull the herd.

543
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:54,820
BRIAN: Followed not too far behind by her
delicious brother with 61. Yes.

544
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,710
LIAM: They walk alike, they talk alike.

545
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,086
MARISHA: You guys are rolling a lot more, too,
because you have three attacks. Right? Or do you

546
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,265
have two attacks?

547
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,178
ALL: Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.

548
00:37:07,178 --> 00:37:08,584
LAURA: Dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger.

549
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:12,440
BRIAN: That is all the time we have for the
Kraghammer/Vasselheim arc. We will now move onto a

550
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:20,005
big fan-favorite arc of the show, episodes 24
through 38. This arc saw our heroes dealing with a

551
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:28,254
darker, more sinister and more personal beings
than they'd ever faced before: The Briarwoods.

552
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:36,013
[musical crescendo]

553
00:37:36,013 --> 00:37:38,258
BRIAN: All right! Briarwoods! Let's get into it.

554
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:43,669
TALIESIN: You made it weird, man.

555
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:47,955
BRIAN: We're going to discuss the Briarwoods arc
now.

556
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:49,844
TRAVIS: Fill in the story from what happened
before that.

557
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:59,404
BRIAN: No! Nope! Let them wonder. Matt, question
from @saraheliz135. "What was Seeker Asum's plan to

558
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:03,664
"investigate the Briarwoods before Vax threw a
wrench into it?"

559
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:12,795
MATT: He was trying to find some sort of proof
that they perhaps didn't have the political power

560
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:17,357
for the promises they were making to build the
bridge between the Shearing Channel and

561
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:25,906
Wildemount. The whole ordeal of the dinner was this
meeting of the strange, mysterious, and somewhat

562
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:32,099
secluded Whitestone society and the Council of
Emon in hopes to bridge this gap with the

563
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,452
Briarwoods who represented interests from
Whitestone. They seemed to have connections and

564
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:41,826
boasted a lot of knowledge of Whitestone,
political connections. Asum was reading something

565
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:49,196
off about them. He was trying to seek some element
of proving or catching them in a lie about them being

566
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:55,743
able to do so, and as such, save the Council from
anything negative. I don't think he really knew

567
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:59,464
how deep it went, obviously. He didn't trust that
their politics were in line.

568
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:02,613
BRIAN: Interesting. Threw a wrench in it.

569
00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:03,678
LIAM: Oh well.

570
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:04,722
BRIAN: Oh well!

571
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:05,987
LIAM: Great episodes.

572
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:12,279
BRIAN: Vax's got to Vax. Travis, question from
Mike Garcia. "How close were you to murdering Liam

573
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:18,167
"when you destroyed the pencil? How close was Grog
to doing something more regrettable to Vax? Cask

574
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,895
"of ale destroyed close?"

575
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:31,071
TRAVIS: Wow. Well, Mike, that was a pretty hot
moment, shaving ole Groggy's half-beard while he

576
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:40,458
was asleep. That was a new level. The mechanical
pencil bends to rage really easily. That kicked

577
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:46,438
off months of me trying to get you back,
actually.

578
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:49,051
LIAM: But it wasn't the beginning! It was a
midpoint!

579
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:55,845
TRAVIS: It was a new echelon. A new world order
had started. That's when I realized how damn

580
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:59,996
slippery you are because I could never get my damn
hands on you to do some shit! I kept trying to pants

581
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:06,672
him or trip him or whatever, but I kept failing. It
was pretty gnarly.

582
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:12,927
BRIAN: Liam, what was that like on your side of
things?

583
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:18,559
LIAM: I don't think I realized in the game how
furious Travis was.

584
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,538
TRAVIS: Could you not feel the 100 degrees Kelvin
pouring off of my person?!

585
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:28,222
BRIAN: You couldn't feel the leg violently shaking
under the table as all the violence went to that leg?

586
00:40:28,222 --> 00:40:30,417
TALIESIN: Trucks going by all the time.

587
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:36,579
LIAM: It was magical, I figured it would just come
back! He'd already fucked with my shit plenty of

588
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:40,084
times. I thought it was just tit for tat. I was
wrong.

589
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:47,213
BRIAN: Matt, question from @settiai. "Just who was
the woman in her late 40s/early 50s that Percy saw

590
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:53,179
"with his nat 20 roll in 'The Sun Tree', the one
with the wolves outside Whitestone?"

591
00:40:53,179 --> 00:41:01,254
MATT: That was a hunter. That was a denizen of
Whitestone who was out hunting with the wolves at

592
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:07,819
night. If they had seen you, it could have been
either an opportunity for you to learn things

593
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:12,220
about the city and its current state, as opposed
to wandering in and figuring it out as it happens.

594
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:18,492
Or if it went poorly, someone who could try and
escape and go back and relay information to the

595
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:26,973
Briarwoods in hopes of not being killed or getting
some possible favor with the overlords. Out of

596
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:33,932
fear. They weren't a follower or a toady. They
were just a person who lived there and wanted to

597
00:41:33,932 --> 00:41:38,080
survive and would have done so if they didn't feel
you could help them.

598
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,939
BRIAN: Interesting. I know.

599
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:46,595
LAURA: That woman's haunted me for a while,
actually. I think about that one a lot.

600
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:47,706
TRAVIS: Really?

601
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:48,688
LAURA: Yeah.

602
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:52,456
BRIAN: Is she wreaking havoc in your guest
bathroom and doing all kinds of stuff in your

603
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:59,675
house? Liam, Zombie_Caddies has a question for
you. "I actually cried when the Briarwoods killed

604
00:41:59,675 --> 00:42:03,867
"Vax, with his last thoughts going through his head
being his friends and Kiki. What was your

605
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:05,663
"inspiration for that moment?"

606
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:11,569
LIAM: For making that happen? I thought I was out
just like I thought I was out in the Raven Queen's

607
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:16,604
tomb. There were things that I wanted-- the game,
because we were playing it so often, it was already

608
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:23,048
evolving heavily. I hadn't worked up the gumption
to say anything in the story to Keyleth. So I was

609
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:29,974
like, I'm getting it out here. Also at that point,
it was starting, but Vax's world was still 98% his

610
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:37,369
sister. I don't know, it was just a chance to
vomit out my inner monologue before exiting the

611
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:38,474
game, I thought.

612
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:40,035
BRIAN: Yeah. You did a great job.

613
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:41,221
SAM: Good vomiting.

614
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:42,843
LAURA: Great vomit.

615
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:54,097
BRIAN: It says that on his CV. Professional
vomiter. Question from @argentumlupine for Sam.

616
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,263
Sam! Thank you for coming!

617
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:59,882
SAM: Hi, guys! I was late.

618
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:04,272
BRIAN: He's so close to Ash in my eyeline, that
every time I go to ask him a question, I just want

619
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:05,500
to look at her.

620
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,117
TALIESIN: We all have that problem.

621
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,984
ASHLEY: Hey!

622
00:43:09,984 --> 00:43:15,290
BRIAN: I like to see her on a screen. Hey! Sam,
what tipped you off that Percy's gun needed to be

623
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,855
destroyed?

624
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:28,537
SAM: Because he did crazy shit with it all the
time and weren't you marking things off the gun at

625
00:43:28,537 --> 00:43:29,526
that point?

626
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:30,522
TALIESIN: Yeah, but--

627
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:40,326
SAM: That's weird! Scanlan is not very perceptive,
not very wise, so it took a long time to realize

628
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:47,957
that something was wrong with it. I think, Matt,
was there a roll associated? Did I ever insight it

629
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,370
or something?

630
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,791
MATT: There may have been and I don't recall the
specifics of that.

631
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:55,638
TALIESIN: There was a roll to get me to give it to
you, which I was not pleased about.

632
00:43:55,638 --> 00:43:57,162
MARISHA: Wait, did he use Friends?

633
00:43:57,162 --> 00:43:58,185
SAM: I did.

634
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:01,364
MATT: I'm pretty sure you figured that out on your
own. I don't think I made you roll to figure that

635
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:02,277
information.

636
00:44:02,277 --> 00:44:07,671
SAM: It was pretty apparent. I sat next to
Taliesin for most of the campaign, so I feel like

637
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:10,838
I saw him more, but I guess I didn't.

638
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:19,245
LIAM: There's also no mistaking Taliesin/Percy's
utter shock and dismay at that happening. It was

639
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:21,989
not manufactured, it was real.

640
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:24,551
TALIESIN: I was not happy! Don't do this, please
don't do this!

641
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:30,510
SAM: I did not think that he would be upset with
me at all! I thought I was doing him a big favor,

642
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,274
getting rid of the bad thing! And he'd be like,
"Aw, thanks, Scanlan!" No! He hated that!

643
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:39,239
MARISHA: He would have done that himself way
sooner!

644
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,941
TALIESIN: Built it in a fucking barn! Two mystical
elements involved! Nope. Nothing.

645
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:46,455
LAURA: How much did that gun cost?

646
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:51,979
TALIESIN: It was priceless and I never managed to
build another one!

647
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:55,200
LAURA: I know you didn't! You were magic
weaponless the whole rest of the game!

648
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,093
TALIESIN: Because it was impossible to recreate!

649
00:44:57,093 --> 00:45:01,756
SAM: I just thought it was a good gun, I did not
know it had any of those things associated with it!

650
00:45:01,756 --> 00:45:05,990
TALIESIN: So pristine. Two magical elements welded
into-- oh lord!

651
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,865
MARISHA: And you were going for the trifecta.
Yeah, you were going for it.

652
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:14,222
LIAM: That tesseract thing, you can make 
another one of those, right?

653
00:45:14,222 --> 00:45:16,031
(laughter)

654
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:19,213
TALIESIN: But it was cursed, apparently, so there
was that.

655
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:25,924
MARISHA: Would there have been any other way to
break him from that?

656
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:32,855
MATT: The only way to break it would have been to
physically kill Orthax. Go to where Orthax would

657
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:41,813
reform in the Abyss and then destroy him there. Or
destroy the implement in which the curse had bound

658
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:44,273
him in, so honestly it was the better choice.

659
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:46,969
TALIESIN: Orthax is still out there, though.

660
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:49,473
MATT: From what you know, yeah.

661
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:50,946
TALIESIN: Yeah? Cool. All right.

662
00:45:50,946 --> 00:45:57,048
BRIAN: Matt, are you keeping track of some of this
stuff from the campaign, since the new campaign is

663
00:45:57,048 --> 00:46:04,977
going to be set in the future of the current
world? Are you having to keep notes of what-ifs,

664
00:46:04,977 --> 00:46:08,127
and are you trying not to tie the two too closely
together?

665
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:15,783
MATT: Well, both. Well, now, yes. I don't want the
new campaign to tie too strongly to this campaign.

666
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:19,057
I want it to be its own thing. I want the story to
be something wholly unique and new and not feel

667
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:24,237
like it's living in the shadow of or trying to
connect directly to the last game. It's a very

668
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:27,513
different part of the world. There will be choices
that were made and things you guys did in this

669
00:46:27,513 --> 00:46:32,279
campaign that have affected the world and will
effect elements down the road, per se. But I don't

670
00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:36,594
want it to be a continuation directly, I want it
to feel new and different. So I'm keeping track of

671
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,419
it all for my own internal consistency, and for
answering questions for people who are playing

672
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:44,383
their own games in Tal'Dorei and beyond, but
that's my idea.

673
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:50,148
BRIAN: Okay, that makes sense. Matt, actually, if
you could, Arthur Ornelas asks, "Could we get a

674
00:46:50,148 --> 00:46:55,828
"little insight into Sylas and Delilah and the life
choices they made that led to Vecna. How much of

675
00:46:55,828 --> 00:46:58,298
"that was Tal's notes and how much was your
brain?"

676
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:01,647
MATT: Taliesin, you just told me the Briarwoods
came and murdered your family.

677
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:09,123
TALIESIN: I tried to hand you nothing I wouldn't
have known. Everything I gave you about Whitestone

678
00:47:09,123 --> 00:47:13,753
was all. I remember you specifically going, saying
like, if you have anything else to add, do it now.

679
00:47:13,753 --> 00:47:16,749
MATT: Yep.

680
00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:20,297
TALIESIN: Yeah. I didn't know anything about them
so I didn't write anything about them.

681
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:24,835
MATT: Which I think is a great tool for players
when you're creating character backstories. Write

682
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:29,622
in as much as your character knows because it
gives the DM room to create in that space and

683
00:47:29,622 --> 00:47:34,034
surprise you and, you know, create things behind
the scenes for them. It's like, in this

684
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:39,515
perspective, with the Briarwoods, I'd created a
scenario where they were not like super powerful

685
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:46,205
lord and lady in the Dwendalian Empire, but they
had some renown, some power, some connections, and

686
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:54,779
they existed a comfortable life out there. She was
a lesser mage, working with an academy out there,

687
00:47:54,779 --> 00:48:02,532
and her husband had gotten sick. The disease that
had begun to take him they couldn't find a cure

688
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:07,208
for, so she went out to try and find a way of
curing it, trying to find somebody who could

689
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:14,669
concoct a means of doing so, and <i>did</i>, and
returned too late and he had passed. She was so

690
00:48:14,669 --> 00:48:20,244
distraught by it that she began to just delve into
her meditation, delving into her magics, trying to

691
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:24,814
find something to stop him, just screamed into the
Astral Sea her fury, and a voice whispered back.

692
00:48:24,814 --> 00:48:29,947
And it said, "I can help you." And that was Vecna.
She didn't know that at the time, but these

693
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:35,405
whispers started to come to her in her dreams, and
began to give her elements of information. And in

694
00:48:35,405 --> 00:48:41,037
her grief, she began to just follow them blindly,
and eventually it led her to one of Vecna's old

695
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:47,198
laboratories, with an old servant of his that
forgot his name for ages. He's so old that he

696
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:51,497
doesn't know his name, just kind of this undead
servant, this powerful creature that watches over

697
00:48:51,497 --> 00:48:56,642
it, and that's where she found, through the
whispers, the rites of vampirism. And he was

698
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:03,511
like, "I can give you the secret to bring your
love back to life, but then you owe me. You're

699
00:49:03,511 --> 00:49:09,745
"mine." And so she said, "Whatever it takes." The
resurrection of Sylas as a vampire was a fraction

700
00:49:09,745 --> 00:49:13,811
of Vecna's power that tied them to him.

701
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:15,477
LAURA: That makes them even cooler!

702
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:18,132
TRAVIS: We shouldn't have killed them.

703
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:19,214
LAURA: No.

704
00:49:19,214 --> 00:49:23,863
MATT: However, because of her toying with
necromancy, which is outlawed in the Dwendalian

705
00:49:23,863 --> 00:49:29,065
empire, and people were seeing her acting weird,
she was pursued, discovered to have been toying

706
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:34,507
with necromancy, and there was a hunt out for them
both. They were both arrested, they got away, and

707
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:39,439
there was a hunt to find them and have them
executed. And so they fled the Dwendalian empire,

708
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:45,762
went to the Menagerie Coast, which is where Port
Damali is, which is kind of like the last major

709
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:52,573
port town on the way western to Tal'Dorei, and
that was where they ran into Ripley. And Ripley

710
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:56,468
had her own thing she was fleeing from and they
both were like, hey we're both fugitives from the

711
00:49:56,468 --> 00:50:01,601
Dwendalian Empire with really no direction, let's
work together. And that's where they had heard

712
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:09,018
about this place of Whitestone, and they began to
talk and get in with the family and began to make

713
00:50:09,018 --> 00:50:13,005
these trips from Port Damali to Whitestone to
build a relationship with them, to take their

714
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:18,584
guard down. Made some alliances there, turned some
people who worked in the castle with this whole

715
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:22,906
plan of just completely gutting this family that
had, for the most part for their own intention,

716
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:27,122
cut themselves off from the rest of the world
politically so no one would really know or care if

717
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:28,653
they went missing or died.

718
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:31,112
LIAM: Not gonna lie, I wouldn't mind playing in
their campaign.

719
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:38,296
TALIESIN: Weird note on the Briarwoods, also, in
my head when I wrote them for myself I gave them

720
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:46,150
no supernatural elements whatsoever in my head.
But I was reminded of a married couple from New

721
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:51,069
Orleans. There's an old ghost story in New
Orleans, that they do on the haunted house tour of

722
00:50:51,069 --> 00:50:56,509
a house that had a fire, and when the fire brigade
went in they went upstairs and they just found

723
00:50:56,509 --> 00:51:03,469
disastrously mutilated bodies of people who were
obviously kept alive for way t-- were still alive.

724
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:10,693
Like a torture chamber of just awful and weird.
And as they were trying to figure this out the

725
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:17,034
rich couple just got into a coach with their stuff
and left and were never seen or heard from again.

726
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:22,243
They were just <i>out</i>. And I find it interesting
that they kind of had a similar, like, "Later,

727
00:51:22,243 --> 00:51:23,540
"we're out of here."

728
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,309
MATT: Yep, that's kind of how they done it. That's
funny, I didn't know that.

729
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:31,670
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'll find the story, it's a
really big New Orleans ghost story.

730
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,648
BRIAN: My parents had a similar story.

731
00:51:33,648 --> 00:51:35,038
TALIESIN: Explains a lot.

732
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:45,056
BRIAN: It does! Laura, @GloriaRokicki would like
to know, "Did Vex have feelings for Percy at this

733
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:49,627
"time, and how did watching this darkness bloom in
him affect her?"

734
00:51:49,627 --> 00:52:00,257
LAURA: Oh yeah, the "Darling, take the mask off."
That was definitely starting around then. I don't

735
00:52:00,257 --> 00:52:06,211
know. I think it attracted her to him more. How
fucked up is that?

736
00:52:06,211 --> 00:52:08,177
(laughter)

737
00:52:08,177 --> 00:52:11,118
BRIAN: Got a nice fist in the air for that one.

738
00:52:11,118 --> 00:52:13,740
LAURA: Yeah. Sorry.

739
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,317
MARISHA: Was it like a, "Ooh he's broken, I can
fix him!"

740
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:19,396
LAURA: "I can help him!" No, it's just like, edgy.

741
00:52:19,396 --> 00:52:22,308
(laughter)

742
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,010
MARISHA: Amazing.

743
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,881
BRIAN: Thoughts?

744
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:33,312
TALIESIN: He didn't know the voice in his head was
real. He literally thought it was-- He was in the

745
00:52:33,312 --> 00:52:39,093
midst, again, it was a very nervous-breakdown-y
reality for him. His hair went shock white, he

746
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:47,869
woke up on a boat in shock for months, and just
didn't talk to people until he did. And yeah, the

747
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:49,022
dream he thought was just--

748
00:52:49,022 --> 00:52:50,275
LAURA: I mean, smoke came out of his body!

749
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:53,929
TALIESIN: Well, that was the first time that it
ever happened though. That's the thing, is he had

750
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:59,371
had some weird dreams and was like, "I'm going to
build this weird thing." But it had not connected

751
00:52:59,371 --> 00:53:05,748
that that was actually a real thing at all until
that point. It had just been like, "maybe I'm just

752
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:07,583
"having a really bad time."

753
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:12,176
LIAM: Also, can anybody correct me if I'm wrong, I
don't remember any whiff of any of that from the

754
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:16,387
home game at all. It just percolated under the
surface until we started the show.

755
00:53:16,387 --> 00:53:21,354
MATT: Even the story that Taliesin gave me was
just, he had a dream where some dark entity showed

756
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:26,671
him how to make a gun. And that was it. And the
way I developed it was Orthax was not going to

757
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:33,071
begin to manifest itself until the moment of
possible vengeance arose. The minute that he

758
00:53:33,071 --> 00:53:40,586
allowed that fury to see someone who he intended
to kill before him as part of his list, that was

759
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:45,426
when the demon would begin to manifest itself. So
it didn't until the Briarwood arc.

760
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:48,879
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. It was entirely possible
from what I handed. I very specifically was like,

761
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:54,162
if you decide that that isn't anything, it doesn't
have to be anything, it could have just been-- had

762
00:53:54,162 --> 00:53:56,275
a weird dream one day, woke up, and built
something awful.

763
00:53:56,275 --> 00:54:02,372
BRIAN: Yeah. You seem not <i>too</i> attached to some
ideas. I know you've mentioned that before on the

764
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:07,370
show, where there's some stuff where you leave it
to Matt's discretion. Do you guys all feel that

765
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:14,762
way? I know you get uncomfortable when I say this,
but because Matt is like a one or two star DM out

766
00:54:14,762 --> 00:54:21,964
of ten or whatever, do you find that it's easier
to trust him with stuff, does that make sense?

767
00:54:21,964 --> 00:54:27,349
LAURA: Well that's half the fun, is going halfway
with it and letting him take the rest, because you

768
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:31,180
don't want to know all the mysteries, you know?
The fun is discovering it.

769
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,732
BRIAN: And he's going to also spin it into a
beautiful story with a bunch of different layers

770
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:36,370
and things too, as we're learning.

771
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:41,424
MATT: It gives me the opportunity, and like anybody
out there who has DM-ed a game can agree with me--

772
00:54:41,424 --> 00:54:43,032
BRIAN: Don't look at me.

773
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:44,596
MATT: --gives the opportunity for the DM to
play--

774
00:54:44,596 --> 00:54:46,851
(laughter)

775
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:51,746
MATT: --gives the opportunity to collaborate on
the backstory element, too, and surprise the

776
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:56,780
players. That's the thing. It's really cool as a
player to play through a game and not have all the

777
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:02,754
answers to your own story, and then to have things
surprise you and change your perspective, and then

778
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:07,191
it becomes more intriguing to you as a player. So
the more you outline, the more you detail

779
00:55:07,191 --> 00:55:12,216
specifically the elements of your history as a
character, the less you have to look forward to

780
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:14,097
to surprise you down the line, in my opinion.

781
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:18,810
BRIAN: You guys have to be so excited about the
prospect of sort of hitting the Etch-a-Sketch and

782
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:20,879
starting again with that.

783
00:55:20,879 --> 00:55:27,633
SAM: It's going to be so exciting. Nerve-wracking.
The first session is going to just be us--

784
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:29,389
LIAM: Who are you? Who am I?

785
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:31,539
SAM: Yeah, like why is Travis talking like that?

786
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:34,860
(laughter)

787
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,092
TALIESIN: (Swedish Chef voice)

788
00:55:37,092 --> 00:55:40,523
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) I will speak with
this--

789
00:55:40,523 --> 00:55:44,847
LAURA: See, he's joked about this multiple times. I
think it might actually be honest.

790
00:55:44,847 --> 00:55:46,390
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Hi-ya!

791
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:52,474
BRIAN: 115 more episodes of Travis talking like
that? Marisha, question for you from

792
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,825
Blangadager--

793
00:55:54,825 --> 00:55:56,304
LAURA: That's awesome.

794
00:55:56,304 --> 00:56:02,387
BRIAN: I know, it's great. "Considering where Vox
Machina was at during this time point, had Vox

795
00:56:02,387 --> 00:56:07,114
"Machina continued to kill with extreme violence
without concern of moral consequence, would

796
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,953
"Keyleth have left the party?"

797
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:16,113
MARISHA: That is such an extreme way of putting
exactly what they were doing. It's very accurate.

798
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:25,110
She was. I had a weird crisis with Keyleth for a
little bit. For a while, I was like, I can't stay!

799
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:32,303
What I am I doing here? Your friends will be the
first people to drag you down. They're bad

800
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:33,533
influences.

801
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:36,609
MATT: I remember you talking to me about that. We
were discussing what would happen if you decided

802
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:40,723
to go that route. We were like, well, Keyleth just
leaves and you make a new character. And maybe

803
00:56:40,723 --> 00:56:41,976
she'll come back, maybe she won't.

804
00:56:41,976 --> 00:56:48,881
MARISHA: And also at that time, I think it was
about that time I kept repeating: I have to

805
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:55,379
continue my Aramente. I feel like I'm just dicking
around at this point. I still have work to do. I

806
00:56:55,379 --> 00:57:01,412
got to go. You were also going through a
character-- there were a few character crises.

807
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:03,622
LIAM: I'm real glad you didn't make a new
character.

808
00:57:03,622 --> 00:57:10,469
MARISHA: Yeah, me too. I mean, Keyleth was pretty
boss there at the end. I almost left.

809
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:11,773
LAURA: Pretty freaking boss.

810
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:16,944
MARISHA: Respect the antlers. (laughing)
Practically goldfish.

811
00:57:16,944 --> 00:57:22,903
BRIAN: Matt, this is a really interesting question
from TheOodSigma, "What would have happened if

812
00:57:22,903 --> 00:57:24,638
"they had left Ripley in the cell?"

813
00:57:24,638 --> 00:57:34,039
MATT: Ripley probably would have either found a way
to escape or once the Briarwoods were freed you

814
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:37,614
would have to go back down to deal with that. But
the minute she had any chance of escape she would

815
00:57:37,614 --> 00:57:44,139
have, or probably try and work her way into your
wiles. If she was purely unable to escape the

816
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:49,767
prison and you knew who she was, and you had
defeated the Briarwoods, and Whitestone was yours

817
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:56,102
once more and you just had her prostrate in a cell
with no weapons, and you intending to murder her,

818
00:57:56,102 --> 00:58:03,401
she would have done everything in her power to be
as sly and convincing that she was as used as anyone

819
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:09,540
else. As Cassandra was, and to get in your good
graces and the first chance she had to abscond

820
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,894
with any of your technology, gone.

821
00:58:12,894 --> 00:58:14,291
BRIAN: Wow. Really?

822
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:15,676
LAURA: What a bitch.

823
00:58:15,676 --> 00:58:20,817
TALIESIN: I imagine her as the evil version of the
librarian character from The Mummy.

824
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:22,650
MATT: That's a good point of reference.

825
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,757
TALIESIN: The psychotic Joker version of that
character.

826
00:58:24,757 --> 00:58:26,793
MATT: Yeah, very much so. Definitely.

827
00:58:26,793 --> 00:58:34,613
BRIAN: The Brendan Fraser Mummy franchise or the
newly minted-- now Matt, follow-up question for

828
00:58:34,613 --> 00:58:42,057
you-- watched it on a plane, as God intended--
this is from Maxvsthegames, "What happened with

829
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:47,703
"the bodies of the de Rolo family? Were they buried
or did Vox Machina end up fighting their skeletons

830
00:58:47,703 --> 00:58:51,293
"in the streets of Whitestone?"

831
00:58:51,293 --> 00:59:02,749
MATT: No. To get a little dark here-- No. The
Briarwoods, in order to cement their rule, they

832
00:59:02,749 --> 00:59:09,685
needed to instill absolute fear of fleeing or any
sort of rebellion. So you don't just murder the

833
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:17,501
family, you leave them in public as a sign. So
those bodies you saw hanging from the Sun Tree

834
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:19,169
weren't the first to hang from that tree.

835
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:20,603
TALIESIN: I had that vibe.

836
00:59:20,603 --> 00:59:25,517
MATT: In fact, I never got to tell you, because it never
came up and nobody would have told you at that time, but

837
00:59:25,517 --> 00:59:29,023
when you saw the Vox Machina hanging from the Sun
Tree, those were almost the exact same arrangement

838
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,328
as Percy's family were after Whitestone.

839
00:59:31,328 --> 00:59:36,528
TALIESIN: I assumed. I like the way you think.

840
00:59:36,528 --> 00:59:42,396
LIAM: Can you imagine Percy 30 years in the future
being an old, happy fart and just going out to the

841
00:59:42,396 --> 00:59:49,543
window and seeing beautiful Whitestone, beautiful
tree, and just the invisible imagination of that.

842
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:51,531
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Never gone.

843
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:59,148
TRAVIS: What the fuck, man? The power of Christ
compels you. Get out of here.

844
00:59:59,148 --> 01:00:06,623
TALIESIN: It's a very blood-laden family to begin
with. At some point, I'll write a little bit of

845
01:00:06,623 --> 01:00:12,129
the stuff I've scribbled down. It's just one more
ghost story for that bloody castle. There's a

846
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:19,032
<i>lot</i> of them. It's highly appropriate for
Whitestone.

847
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:29,501
BRIAN: D-Roll me away, baby. Hey, Ashley? Cure our
darkness with a 9th-level--

848
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:32,273
MARISHA: I thought that was the handle at first.

849
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:40,312
BRIAN: No, I wish. The handle is much better, and
it's SerPounce_a_Lot. "Is Pike's ability to astral

850
01:00:40,312 --> 01:00:46,917
"project across great distances to help her friends
a sign that she is special to Sarenrae?"

851
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:51,229
ASHLEY: (high-pitched) Um.

852
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:54,508
(laughter)

853
01:00:54,508 --> 01:00:58,424
SAM: Or just a sign that you live in New York for
most of the year.

854
01:00:58,424 --> 01:01:09,040
ASHLEY: I would like to think that that's the
reason why, but I believe it's because I live

855
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:16,878
across the country. So I know Matt found a way
around that, which I'm so thankful that he did.

856
01:01:16,878 --> 01:01:21,068
And here I am, still an astral projection.

857
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:25,612
BRIAN: But at least you're in high definition.

858
01:01:25,612 --> 01:01:29,041
ASHLEY: A high-def astral project!

859
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:34,074
LIAM: She brought Sarenrae's faith back to
the continent, didn't she?

860
01:01:34,074 --> 01:01:38,107
MATT: She was one of the main figures that began
to restore the knowledge of the experience.

861
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:46,756
BRIAN: Okay, okay. I can't not say it when I hear
it. It's one of those things; when I hear it, I

862
01:01:46,756 --> 01:01:53,915
say it. Matt, FrostDragon85 wants to know, "What
would have happened if Lady Briarwood's ritual

863
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:55,469
"succeeded?"

864
01:01:55,469 --> 01:02:01,753
MATT: It did. She succeeded the ritual, but she
didn't know what she was looking for. Like all

865
01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:06,610
things piecemeal with Vecna, she was told to
prepare all these things to succeed. And when it

866
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:13,191
succeeded, it triggered the siphon, which became
this tiny dot that did nothing from her

867
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:21,341
perspective. And so she went from "All right, this
grand ceremony!" to "That's it? We failed." It was

868
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:24,827
too early, they were pushed to do it, and they
were already afraid it wouldn't have functioned,

869
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:29,582
but the idea was they succeeded entirely. And if
you guys had prodded it enough over time, began to

870
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:35,167
delve into the research and make that a big point,
you might have discovered that it was a successful

871
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:39,643
ritual, but the fact that you didn't made it more
fun for me to play in the background anyway. As

872
01:02:39,643 --> 01:02:46,927
far as Delilah was concerned, it failed, but when
she was killed the first time and then recovered

873
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:52,326
in her clone body and began to reconnect with the
whispers of Vecna, Vecna was like, "No, you did

874
01:02:52,326 --> 01:02:57,730
"good. And now to move onto the next one, now to
prepare for the next siphon to be triggered." And

875
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:02,468
so that was the background progression of her arc
while you guys were battling the Conclave and

876
01:03:02,468 --> 01:03:03,586
everything.

877
01:03:03,586 --> 01:03:11,190
BRIAN: It stresses me out that it's so layered and
involved because you guys have to face a whole

878
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:18,467
other campaign, and he's even better now than he
was at coming up with this stuff. I'm just trying

879
01:03:18,467 --> 01:03:25,131
to make you guys nervous and scared. Travis,
Lizlevelup wants to know, "Percy gave Grog Craven

880
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:30,809
"Edge in this arc (episode 36). When you first got
given the card, what did you expect from the

881
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:34,867
"sword? Did you have a "what have I done" moment
when you read the card fully?"

882
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:40,878
TRAVIS: Oh, man. I didn't even know what a
sentient weapon was, I had never even heard of

883
01:03:40,878 --> 01:03:48,070
that. He just described it as some big, gorgeous
greatsword, and I was like, "I can wield that,

884
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:54,607
"I'll take it." And Percy's reaction of reading the
first few lines of the card and showing a little

885
01:03:54,607 --> 01:04:05,323
dismay having just been cured of his current curse, I was
like, "Give it to me, it'll be fine." So when Matt

886
01:04:05,323 --> 01:04:14,780
started talking, it was a total shock. Reading it
was only half of the story. What did we have to

887
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,681
do? Identify, or we had to do something else--

888
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:21,173
MATT: You had to attune to it to reveal it all or
Identify it in advance.

889
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:30,128
TRAVIS: Yeah, the rest of that card is super
important. That's a big part of it. So I think he

890
01:04:30,128 --> 01:04:36,294
was enjoying this new friend that talked to him
and helped him shish-kebab people really well.

891
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:49,089
BRIAN: Turned out great. Talk about no strings
attached. Matt, question from Jessie Lewis. "How

892
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:52,392
"did you intend for Vox Machina to get out of the
acid chamber?"

893
01:04:52,392 --> 01:05:01,369
MATT: I didn't. No, there were a number of ways.
They could have attempted to focus all their

894
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:06,609
strength towards the residuum wall that was
blocking them off. They could have tried to block

895
01:05:06,609 --> 01:05:12,340
up or destroy the chutes in which the acid was
being delivered to the chamber and bought some

896
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:16,567
time. I believe the way you got to the button--

897
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:18,293
LIAM: I used the Cloak of the Mountebank.

898
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:23,555
MATT: Yeah, the Mountebank to teleport through.
There was a way of opening the door, but it was

899
01:05:23,555 --> 01:05:27,300
elsewhere in the chamber. There was a possibility
of waiting for the Briarwoods to leave and then

900
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,159
fiddle with the buttons, but... kind of jumped the
gun on that one.

901
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,907
LIAM: Yeah, I thought I was hitting the door
open button.

902
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:36,337
MATT: No, you were not. But that, once again,
wonderful D&amp;D moment.

903
01:05:36,337 --> 01:05:38,824
LIAM: Yeah, that was a rug yank moment.

904
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:40,892
MARISHA: How did we end up getting out of that?

905
01:05:40,892 --> 01:05:46,233
MATT: You didn't. The rest of the campaign is a
dream!

906
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:57,711
BRIAN: It's kind of like that TV show about the
plane crash and the island. Sam. Cast True

907
01:05:57,711 --> 01:06:02,922
Resurrection on your career with an answer for
this person. Oh, it's also Blangadanger back for

908
01:06:02,922 --> 01:06:08,840
you! "Had Scanlan learned of his daughter before
Kaylie confronted him, what would he have done

909
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,700
"differently?"

910
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,231
SAM: Say that again, I wasn't listening as is
frequent with this show.

911
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:17,971
BRIAN: People talk. "Had Scanlan learned of his
daughter before Kaylie confronted him, what would

912
01:06:17,971 --> 01:06:19,385
"he have done differently?"

913
01:06:19,385 --> 01:06:20,983
SAM: Not try to get with her?

914
01:06:20,983 --> 01:06:26,185
(laughter)

915
01:06:26,185 --> 01:06:28,517
BRIAN: That's all the time we have for tonight!

916
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:34,752
SAM: I don't know, probably would have run away
from that information. That's scary information,

917
01:06:34,752 --> 01:06:43,269
and not seeing her in the flesh, if he had just
heard, "You got a daughter out there, she's

918
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:45,962
"looking for you," he'd probably be like, "Let's go
to another town."

919
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:51,692
BRIAN: I have a tendency to not ask a lot of
questions when I'm drunk.

920
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:55,481
LIAM: Don't Try to Get With Her: The Scanlan
Shorthalt Story.

921
01:06:55,481 --> 01:07:00,300
BRIAN: And the problem is that if she resembled
him, he would be even more attracted to her

922
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,451
because she--

923
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,505
SAM: I feel like that was part of the problem.

924
01:07:03,505 --> 01:07:09,604
BRIAN: That was part of the problem. Taliesin.
Gornuk23 wants to know-- can you believe there's

925
01:07:09,604 --> 01:07:14,313
23 of them? "Who was the final, unnamed barrel on
the List meant for?"

926
01:07:14,313 --> 01:07:18,734
LIAM: Reveal it.

927
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:21,894
BRIAN: This is the episode where you can reveal
everything.

928
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:28,928
TALIESIN: I think it's going to be slightly
disappointing. It was not meant for him, which I

929
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:33,866
know a lot of people thought it was for himself.
It was his acknowledgement that the List was not

930
01:07:33,866 --> 01:07:40,081
the end, and his acknowledgement that the minute
he started this, that this was going to be an

931
01:07:40,081 --> 01:07:45,898
unending cycle of awful. And so that barrel was
meant to be a fresh start for a brand new List.

932
01:07:45,898 --> 01:07:50,888
And it was going to be once you hit that, it was,
"They're all dead, it's time to find the next six

933
01:07:50,888 --> 01:07:58,822
"people, and this is who you are now." I know I've
said this a lot and people hate it, but I want to

934
01:07:58,822 --> 01:08:05,163
make this clear. The reason I give Percy a lot of
crap is because when he started building this

935
01:08:05,163 --> 01:08:11,740
thing and going on a revenge run, he was acutely
aware of what he was doing. There was no surprise,

936
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:18,248
and the first time he saw a gun in the wild, it
wasn't, "Oh no," it was, "That went a little more

937
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:24,425
"slowly than I expected." He was expecting Ripley
to have guns, he was expecting all of this to go

938
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:28,712
horribly wrong because he knew it would. And so he
was like, "I really want to kill these six people,

939
01:08:28,712 --> 01:08:33,881
"and I'm excited to help <i>thousands</i> of other
people in my lifetime die this way as well. It's

940
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:38,657
"worth it. Trade done." And that was the line of,
"I know what I'm becoming, I know what I'm doing,

941
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:42,102
"and I'm doing it anyway even though it's really
dumb."

942
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:44,324
LAURA: He was a pretty bad guy.

943
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:52,189
BRIAN: He was. What does it say about you for
falling in love with him? Laura, question for you

944
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:58,677
from Buzzrock1. "How did Vex get Vax's snake belt
back?" Do you remember?

945
01:08:58,677 --> 01:09:01,094
LAURA: How did his snake belt go missing in the
first place?

946
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:02,973
LIAM: It went missing when I--

947
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:04,469
TRAVIS: Threw it at the--

948
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:07,888
LAURA: Oh, I went and flirted with the guards. I
talked to Matt about that--

949
01:09:07,888 --> 01:09:11,182
SAM, LIAM, and TALIESIN: Classic.

950
01:09:11,182 --> 01:09:13,271
LAURA: Yeah, I went and flirted with the guards
and got it back for him.

951
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:16,612
MARISHA: Was it one of those cases where you saw
one of the guards wearing the belt and you were

952
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:18,852
like, "Dude, for real?"

953
01:09:18,852 --> 01:09:21,208
LAURA: I think there was a lot of winking
involved.

954
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:28,743
MATT: Yeah, it was a lot of, "Hey, I lost this
thing, could you please go get it for me? Please?"

955
01:09:28,743 --> 01:09:31,699
And he went, "We'll see."

956
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:34,762
LIAM: That physical belt buckle is sitting on my
treasure shelf.

957
01:09:34,762 --> 01:09:40,633
LAURA: I saw another snake belt this weekend and I
almost got it for you. I was like, "He doesn't

958
01:09:40,633 --> 01:09:48,590
"need another snake belt, now it's going to be
another sort of thing." It was a really cool snake

959
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:51,567
belt though! If I hadn't gotten you the other one,
I would have got you this one.

960
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:59,280
BRIAN: We had a few questions about Cassandra for
this arc. We only have time to get to two of them,

961
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:06,083
but Matt, from Tilia-cordata. "If he had failed
the saving throw, would Percy have been forced to

962
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:09,528
"kill Cassandra? Had you always planned for her
name to appear on the gun?"

963
01:10:09,528 --> 01:10:20,894
MATT: I had planned if they had encountered
her... yeah, I guess I did always intend for her to

964
01:10:20,894 --> 01:10:23,891
appear on the gun based on the encounters as they
were going to reveal-- unless there was some way

965
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:28,083
in which they met Cassandra, they had snuck into
the castle and came across her room beforehand and

966
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:36,679
managed to break her of her cycle of mental abuse
with the Briarwoods-- possibly it could have been

967
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:40,949
averted but for the most part, it was designed to
be one of those crux moments where it's a point of

968
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:47,699
showing Percival how deep this terrible choice and
deal he made can go.

969
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:54,430
BRIAN: Somebody had asked what would have happened
to Percy had he shot everyone on the list

970
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,969
including Cassandra. What would have happened to
Percy?

971
01:10:56,969 --> 01:10:59,096
MATT: Oh, six more names would have appeared.

972
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:00,272
TALIESIN: Thank you.

973
01:11:00,272 --> 01:11:03,046
MATT: Yeah, which is why I think it's so
interesting that you say that because I didn't

974
01:11:03,046 --> 01:11:10,631
know that. And the intent of Orthax's revenge
curse is that it's continuous. Once you've made

975
01:11:10,631 --> 01:11:17,029
that deal, you take those six names out, well now
there's six more people you have to kill. And if

976
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:19,961
you don't have anybody you need vengeance for,
let's go find people.

977
01:11:19,961 --> 01:11:22,991
TALIESIN: Percy wouldn't have even blinked. He
would have been right into it.

978
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:27,837
LIAM: What would have happened if he had blinked?
What if he had tried to fight that deal?

979
01:11:27,837 --> 01:11:36,193
MATT: That was when the will contrast comes. The List is
still there, the creature is always there. It just

980
01:11:36,193 --> 01:11:40,458
means that if it lost the current battle, it would
bide its time and come back stronger again until

981
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,684
eventually he loses the will to resist.

982
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:45,088
LAURA: Go Scanlan.

983
01:11:45,088 --> 01:11:48,522
SAM: I knew <i>all</i> of that.

984
01:11:48,522 --> 01:11:52,598
(laughter)

985
01:11:52,598 --> 01:11:59,422
BRIAN: Marisha. Our final question for this arc is
for you from RaibDarkin. "It was during this time

986
01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:04,217
"that Keyleth made two of her most impressive moral
stands. The first: refusing to have Vox Machina

987
01:12:04,217 --> 01:12:09,632
"send the young roc to Whitestone, and the other by
refusing to let the skeletal army overrun it.

988
01:12:09,632 --> 01:12:13,246
"Is this where she began to realize she could be a
leader?"

989
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:22,578
MARISHA: Oh. No. Probably not. 100 percent no. No,
she was still suffering from crippling

990
01:12:22,578 --> 01:12:34,124
self-loathing. Yeah, just no. She still didn't
believe in herself and still was dealing with

991
01:12:34,124 --> 01:12:47,363
insecurity issues. It took her awhile. I think
Keyleth still didn't fully believe it until she

992
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:55,569
was getting that mantle put on her over in the
final ceremony. I remember one of the bigger

993
01:12:55,569 --> 01:13:04,216
turning points of stepping up and making sure she
was a leader was the kraken fight. I put a lot of

994
01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:14,028
responsibility on Keyleth and conversely myself
for not stepping up and forcing a better plan on

995
01:13:14,028 --> 01:13:24,735
us. It was my task that almost got everybody
killed. We almost TPK'ed that one, and we could

996
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:30,987
have done that way better, and I think that was
when she was like, "Oh, once again, those moral

997
01:13:30,987 --> 01:13:35,424
"lessons of inaction. Someone's got to fucking herd
cats."

998
01:13:35,424 --> 01:13:37,451
TRAVIS: And we almost got rid of Tary.

999
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:39,075
LAURA: So close.

1000
01:13:39,075 --> 01:13:43,926
LIAM: Such a strong, decisive leader moment at the
end of that though, when you chose to get out with

1001
01:13:43,926 --> 01:13:47,139
as many as you could, and the way that you did
it.

1002
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:54,504
BRIAN: So foreshadowing of later leadership
qualities, which probably were there the whole

1003
01:13:54,504 --> 01:13:58,483
time, but needed to be fermented, and you needed
the experience and the trials.

1004
01:13:58,483 --> 01:14:02,404
MARISHA: I forgot about that. That was probably
the exact turning point, that moment.

1005
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:07,800
BRIAN: Anything else from the Briarwoods arc that
you guys want to talk to Matt about or ask or ask

1006
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,813
each other?

1007
01:14:08,813 --> 01:14:14,642
MARISHA: I have a question. Had I not rolled a
natural 20 when I stuck my hand into the ziggurat,

1008
01:14:14,642 --> 01:14:19,512
anything under the natural 20, what would have
happened to Keyleth?

1009
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:22,087
LAURA and BRIAN: His eye twitched!

1010
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:31,979
MATT: A natural 20 was pretty close to what you
needed, or a high roll. I think the DC was an 18

1011
01:14:31,979 --> 01:14:40,834
to try to resist the impact. You saw what happened
when they put anything through it. That would have

1012
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:47,430
been Keyleth. She would have gone through, taken a
shit ton of damage, and either died, or if she

1013
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:54,872
survived, thrust out into the Shadowfell,
seriously jacked up on the outskirts of Thar

1014
01:14:54,872 --> 01:15:01,487
Amphala. And you would have found a lot earlier
what the Vecna tie-in to the story was, and it

1015
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:08,063
would have changed a lot of the story at that
point if Keyleth had survived. I can't recall the

1016
01:15:08,063 --> 01:15:12,450
exact amount of damage, but the average was
somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 to 150

1017
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,835
damage.

1018
01:15:13,835 --> 01:15:15,679
LAURA: You didn't have that many hit points at
that point.

1019
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,005
MARISHA: No, not at all.

1020
01:15:17,005 --> 01:15:18,592
TRAVIS: Ain't none of us coming in after you.

1021
01:15:18,592 --> 01:15:25,151
MARISHA: No one even knew I was down there.
Everyone was asleep and I didn't even tell

1022
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:29,660
anybody. You would have woken up and Keyleth would
have been gone.

1023
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,625
TALIESIN: That would have been dark and weird.

1024
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:36,748
MARISHA: How crazy would it have been it if I would
have come back like Robin Williams in Jumanji and

1025
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:42,112
come back 20 years later and I'm like, "The shit
I've seen!"

1026
01:15:42,112 --> 01:15:44,520
LAURA: What would have been crazy is we would have
gone to Thar Amphala and then we would have fought

1027
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,826
you undead.

1028
01:15:45,826 --> 01:15:50,192
MATT: Few things would have been more fucked up in
the game-- I thought about it afterward-- than

1029
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:56,302
having the success of this arc and then your
character, out of curiosity, dead. And then me

1030
01:15:56,302 --> 01:16:01,170
having to tell you, "I'm sorry, Keyleth's gone,
and they don't know where you are."

1031
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:10,231
SAM: We would have been like, "Did we say
something? Grog, did you say something?"

1032
01:16:10,231 --> 01:16:13,587
LAURA: Maybe this is too much for her. I don't
know!

1033
01:16:13,587 --> 01:16:16,332
MATT: And if that was the case, then whatever new
character that would have come along would have

1034
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:21,934
progressed from there. And when you finally got
into Thar Amphala, there would have been an undead

1035
01:16:21,934 --> 01:16:23,613
Keyleth probably under Vecna.

1036
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:26,364
TALIESIN: That would have been so fucked up.

1037
01:16:26,364 --> 01:16:33,492
BRIAN: I would have been <i>so</i> into some undead
Keyleth art for sure. Speaking of damage, our next

1038
01:16:33,492 --> 01:16:40,649
round of CritRoleStats for the Vox Machina
campaign is about damage. The party together has

1039
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:50,724
dealt a total of 50,074 damage. The most damage
taken? Who do you think took the most damage?

1040
01:16:50,724 --> 01:16:54,025
SAM: Vax. Oh wait, maybe Grog.

1041
01:16:54,025 --> 01:17:02,400
BRIAN: The answer is Grog with 5,646 damage taken.
Who do you think dealt the most damage though?

1042
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,821
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

1043
01:17:03,821 --> 01:17:05,867
BRIAN: Okay, Keyleth is your guess. Anybody else?

1044
01:17:05,867 --> 01:17:07,187
LIAM: Yeah, also Keyleth.

1045
01:17:07,187 --> 01:17:08,433
SAM: Pike!

1046
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:10,317
LAURA: Maybe Vax?

1047
01:17:10,317 --> 01:17:21,069
BRIAN: Well, you're correct. The answer is Grog.
Most damage dealt: 10,038. My man, that's right!

1048
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:25,920
LAURA: And we dealt 50,000, that's so much
percentage of our damage dealt.

1049
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:36,505
BRIAN: Damahge. Yeah, stanima. That concludes our
round of questions for the Briarwoods arc. Let's

1050
01:17:36,505 --> 01:17:44,197
move on to discuss episodes 39 through 83 and the
dangerous alliances, questionable party decisions,

1051
01:17:44,197 --> 01:17:51,808
the items of power and mystery that led our heroes
into the path of the Chroma Conclave.

1052
01:17:51,808 --> 01:17:59,276
[musical crescendo]

1053
01:17:59,276 --> 01:18:08,929
All right, we will now discuss the Chroma Conclave. 
Beginning with Matt Mercer. Question for you from Hadley

1054
01:18:08,929 --> 01:18:15,338
DiForti, "During the Conclave attack did you plan
who you would kill off for story purposes or did

1055
01:18:15,338 --> 01:18:18,468
"you roll the dice on their fate?"

1056
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:22,727
MATT: I decided what made more sense. The
Sovereign I wanted to die because I wanted it to

1057
01:18:22,727 --> 01:18:31,919
be a transition into the Council, the Republic of
Emon and Tal'Dorei, and I wanted it to be a

1058
01:18:31,919 --> 01:18:37,681
central figure that had previously become the
highest ally you had attained. To have them

1059
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:42,519
slaughtered immediately would be one of those
giant wind out of the sails, you're on your own

1060
01:18:42,519 --> 01:18:50,518
type sensation. I decided on that and I thought of
which members of the Council would be the most

1061
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:58,495
brave and resolute and probably throw their lives
away in trying to attack this unassailable force

1062
01:18:58,495 --> 01:19:02,696
that had just arrived. So I decided on those based
on what the narrative made sense for.

1063
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:10,593
BRIAN: Interesting, seems like a good choice.
Liam, question for you from @CommanderClay. "Would

1064
01:19:10,593 --> 01:19:14,761
"Vax have left Vox Machina if the Chroma Conclave
had not attacked?"

1065
01:19:14,761 --> 01:19:21,503
LIAM: That's interesting, I'm not sure I know the
answer to that. He definitely wouldn't have left

1066
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:27,391
without his sister. I think the challenge and the
fun of it would have been having to come up with a

1067
01:19:27,391 --> 01:19:34,235
reason despite-- it was similar to your moment.
The way I thought of it was, I'm really going to

1068
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:41,239
have to do some tap-dancing to figure out why I'm
still here. I think he would have been conflicted

1069
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:48,442
and dealing with it. I guess eventually it would
have reached a breaking point. There was a lot of

1070
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:57,164
butting heads at that time in the lead-up, too, and
I think part of it was off the stupid prank war. I

1071
01:19:57,164 --> 01:20:01,981
don't know, and I often get questions like, "What
would have happened if this hadn't happened?" I

1072
01:20:01,981 --> 01:20:04,957
don't know, that's the fun of this game.

1073
01:20:04,957 --> 01:20:08,378
MARISHA: Would you have ever gone with him? Would
you have ever left with your bro?

1074
01:20:08,378 --> 01:20:16,593
LAURA: Yeah. If he talked me into it, I would've
left. I would've fought him about it. But if he

1075
01:20:16,593 --> 01:20:19,650
made that decision and he was going to go, I
would've gone with him.

1076
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:27,729
BRIAN: Interesting, sounds like family. Matt.
Question for you-- why does everyone laugh when I

1077
01:20:27,729 --> 01:20:29,585
say something nice?

1078
01:20:29,585 --> 01:20:32,246
TALIESIN: It's so surprising and out of character.

1079
01:20:32,246 --> 01:20:43,029
BRIAN: Matt, @coelki_king asks, "Did Vox Machina
bring the dragons down on Emon because they messed

1080
01:20:43,029 --> 01:20:46,510
"with the orbs or did this event just happen to 
coincide with that?"

1081
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:52,580
MATT: No, the event just happened to coincide. The
plan that the Conclave was still intending to

1082
01:20:52,580 --> 01:21:01,981
happen, it was still geared towards the
conjunction set upon by the Winter's Crest and

1083
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:05,983
Thordak's escape from the Fire Elemental plane--
this was all long-planned by Raishan and the

1084
01:21:05,983 --> 01:21:12,900
council. However, because you had been noticed
through the orbs, it gave a face, so now there was

1085
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,809
an element of recognizing who you were, these
meddlers to a certain extent. When you did arrive,

1086
01:21:17,809 --> 01:21:24,412
when you did confront certain members who may have
been aware, it also put you on Raishan's radar

1087
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:31,798
very heavily, which led to Raishan finding
information very quickly, ascertaining your

1088
01:21:31,798 --> 01:21:37,596
location in Whitestone once things had gotten a
little rough with the Conclave, and trying to find

1089
01:21:37,596 --> 01:21:40,940
a strong position going forward.

1090
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:47,879
LIAM: May I ask a follow-up question for Matt? Was
it always your plan from when we were at home to

1091
01:21:47,879 --> 01:21:54,074
get to that, and playing every six weeks, would we
have gotten to that Conclave attack this weekend?

1092
01:21:54,074 --> 01:22:02,120
MATT: Probably, yeah. It was my plan when I
introduced the orbs and I introduced Krieg and

1093
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:15,696
Brimscythe, that was all going to be a lead up to
the attack of the Conclave back then. I intended

1094
01:22:15,696 --> 01:22:24,834
that to be an event down the road, and that was
the tease to it. But going at the pace we were

1095
01:22:24,834 --> 01:22:26,768
playing at home, we would have gotten to that by
about now.

1096
01:22:26,768 --> 01:22:35,781
BRIAN: Yeah. Taliesin, question from Heather
Johnson. "What was Percy's plan to take out Grog

1097
01:22:35,781 --> 01:22:42,747
"in the workshop over the skull? He seemed very
sure of himself in a tight space with a raging

1098
01:22:42,747 --> 01:22:44,471
"goliath."

1099
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:50,953
TALIESIN: My thoughts were several. A, I can give
him disadvantage on every attack, every round, and

1100
01:22:50,953 --> 01:22:59,148
B, I know what is in every one of those bottles,
and I had a working kiln. I thought I had enough

1101
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:05,136
stuff around there that I could have had him
bathed in acid, knee-deep in sodium, and probably

1102
01:23:05,136 --> 01:23:13,333
set on fire pretty quickly and kept out of his
reach and kept keeping back, pushing back, and

1103
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:28,009
giving him as much disadvantage, blinding him. It
would have been keeping lots of status effects.

1104
01:23:28,009 --> 01:23:33,213
TRAVIS: See, I heard a great comparison on el
Twitter, which was the Game of Thrones fight

1105
01:23:33,213 --> 01:23:39,681
between the Mountain and the Sand Viper, staying
on the outside and all of that stuff until I get a

1106
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,090
hold of you and then I squish your head like a
pumpkin.

1107
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:47,259
TALIESIN: I was of the opinion I could probably
ride that out a long while.

1108
01:23:47,259 --> 01:23:51,491
LIAM: I love Freddie, he is a darkly fascinating
character. I think Grog would have turned him into

1109
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:54,549
a skid mark.

1110
01:23:54,549 --> 01:23:56,843
TALIESIN: Kept that skull away from you, man,
didn't I?

1111
01:23:56,843 --> 01:24:02,001
(laughter)

1112
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:08,075
BRIAN: Matt, question about everyone's favorite
NPC from @coelki_king, "How close was Gilmore to

1113
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:11,478
"dying before Vox Machina found him under his
shop?"

1114
01:24:11,478 --> 01:24:17,245
MATT: He was really close. It was a choice, it was
whether or not you pursued the treasure, the

1115
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:28,436
money, gold and items that had been shifted away
from the Clasp and looters, or go directly for

1116
01:24:28,436 --> 01:24:33,044
Gilmore. And you had that choice, Vex and the rest
of you, as you were looting your way through, and

1117
01:24:33,044 --> 01:24:37,129
the idea was going to be if you chose to go for
the money, for the treasure, Gilmore would have

1118
01:24:37,129 --> 01:24:42,940
been dead when you found him. Mind you, you could
have possibly Resurrected him, or not, depending

1119
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:47,979
on what the timing was, but that still would have
been the knowledge going forward that you were

1120
01:24:47,979 --> 01:24:54,021
responsible for his death. It was meant to be one
of those crux choices of learning what it meant in

1121
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:59,095
moments of crisis to fight against your own greed
and self-serving ideas versus the greater good

1122
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:00,451
and/or friendships you made.

1123
01:25:00,451 --> 01:25:01,438
LAURA: But we did it!

1124
01:25:01,438 --> 01:25:02,278
MATT: You did it!

1125
01:25:02,278 --> 01:25:05,083
TRAVIS: We saved him.

1126
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:08,291
LIAM: I also think it's important to say that the
last time we had dealt with death was <i>way</i> back

1127
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:13,527
before it was a show. We were in our home game,
and it was that and then Vex dying in the tomb

1128
01:25:13,527 --> 01:25:18,335
were our first real brushes with death in the
game, so we didn't know how likely it was. We

1129
01:25:18,335 --> 01:25:24,782
didn't know the rituals were this strange thing--
I thought it was just this one-time thing that

1130
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:28,794
happened for that moment, I didn't realize it was
going to be this mechanic that you implemented

1131
01:25:28,794 --> 01:25:34,647
into the game, so both finding Gilmore and when
Vex went down, at least for me, I was like, "Oh my

1132
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:40,064
"god, this is the end, it's all over!" And when I
went unconscious, too. And we got more used to it

1133
01:25:40,064 --> 01:25:46,176
as a game mechanic. I don't want to say we got
used to it because every time was rough, but it

1134
01:25:46,176 --> 01:25:50,496
was very new and unsettling in the beginning.

1135
01:25:50,496 --> 01:25:52,405
MATT: Good.

1136
01:25:52,405 --> 01:26:02,707
BRIAN: Yeah, just what you want to hear. Laura,
question for you from Kuributt. "What did Vex find

1137
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:06,011
"under Gilmore's bed when he sent them to
Marquet?"

1138
01:26:06,011 --> 01:26:07,724
LAURA: Oh, have we not answered this before?

1139
01:26:07,724 --> 01:26:09,518
BRIAN: I don't believe we have.

1140
01:26:09,518 --> 01:26:15,592
LAURA: Oh, man! I found a bunch of love letters
from Gilmore and his first boyfriend.

1141
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:17,688
BRIAN: Oh really? That's awesome.

1142
01:26:17,688 --> 01:26:20,971
LAURA: So that's why I didn't tell anybody, I just
put it back because it seemed like, okay,

1143
01:26:20,971 --> 01:26:25,046
this is personal. It was a good confirmation
though that we were actually in Gilmore's bedroom.

1144
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:27,642
Because up until that point, we didn't know for
sure.

1145
01:26:27,642 --> 01:26:32,027
TRAVIS: When did something being personal ever
kept you from snagging something?

1146
01:26:32,027 --> 01:26:37,833
LAURA: It was letters, what good was it going to
do? If it had been letters gilded in gold, I would

1147
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:40,088
have kept them. But they were just letters.

1148
01:26:40,088 --> 01:26:41,871
LIAM: Was there a name for the old beau?

1149
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:44,793
MATT: Oh, for his original--?

1150
01:26:44,793 --> 01:26:46,405
LIAM: That she would have found on the letters?

1151
01:26:46,405 --> 01:26:48,031
MATT: I believe it would have been...

1152
01:26:48,031 --> 01:26:49,448
LAURA: I don't remember that.

1153
01:26:49,448 --> 01:26:52,408
MATT: I don't think I told you the name at the
moment. But it would have been--

1154
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:53,708
BRIAN: Taryon Darrington.

1155
01:26:53,708 --> 01:27:00,337
MATT: Tie it all together. No, it would have been
another Marquesian boy, and I would have had to

1156
01:27:00,337 --> 01:27:02,234
come up with a name on the spot.

1157
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:04,165
LAURA: Purvan.

1158
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:10,299
MATT: No, we're going to leave that name to the
annals of history to never be brought up ever

1159
01:27:10,299 --> 01:27:11,688
again.

1160
01:27:11,688 --> 01:27:24,361
BRIAN: Next question. Matt. Crepuscularious wants
to know-- I haven't been in Latin for a while. Do

1161
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:29,424
they have Latin class? "Matt, what were the
horrible possibilities the team sidestepped with

1162
01:27:29,424 --> 01:27:35,995
"Kashaw's resurrection of Vex? Was invoking Vesh as
much of a razor's edge as it appeared?"

1163
01:27:35,995 --> 01:27:46,632
MATT: Vesh, the threat and the belief that Kashaw
holds in Vesh, was very powerful. And Vesh is a

1164
01:27:46,632 --> 01:27:51,552
dangerous entity on the scale that you guys were
dealing with at the time, definitely. I don't

1165
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:56,002
think it was so much a razor's edge, but it would
have piqued her interest. Essentially, an entity

1166
01:27:56,002 --> 01:28:03,839
that had been, for the most part, kept at the
shadows and primarily focused on Kashaw's journey

1167
01:28:03,839 --> 01:28:10,983
would have been forced to turn an eye to Vox
Machina and meddle in those affairs. And in a

1168
01:28:10,983 --> 01:28:17,896
weird way, the deal with the Raven Queen
circumvented that. So much of the story changed

1169
01:28:17,896 --> 01:28:27,067
the moment that Vax stepped forward. The Raven
Queen's tomb, the thought had approached me of

1170
01:28:27,067 --> 01:28:32,907
having Vesh appear in that circumstance, but
because it was the Raven Queen's tomb, I think she

1171
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:37,843
would have overridden that circumstance and what
little glimpse Vesh would have had would have just

1172
01:28:37,843 --> 01:28:41,454
piqued her curiosity. She wouldn't be able to be
there or exact any sort of immediate strange

1173
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:49,522
occurrence. It's hard to look back in the moment
because some of that was improvised, some of it

1174
01:28:49,522 --> 01:28:56,840
was just trying to feel it out. Yeah, Vesh isn't
necessarily a god, though she likes to put herself

1175
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,941
in that form and say that she is. Kashaw
definitely believes she is, but she's not a god.

1176
01:29:01,941 --> 01:29:11,350
BRIAN: Okay, interesting. Practically gods.
Ashley, question for you from TheHollyPhoenix.

1177
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:17,139
"How did Pike feel knowing that going and getting
her armor probably made the difference between

1178
01:29:17,139 --> 01:29:19,722
"Daxio being destroyed and not?"

1179
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:23,176
ASHLEY: Uh.

1180
01:29:23,176 --> 01:29:26,726
(laughter)

1181
01:29:26,726 --> 01:29:46,877
ASHLEY: You know, I think very happy about it.
What am I trying to say here? I would say it's a

1182
01:29:46,877 --> 01:29:48,509
good thing, always a good thing.

1183
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:53,023
LAURA: Wait, so we went and got Pike's armor and
Fort Daxio got destroyed? What happened? I don't

1184
01:29:53,023 --> 01:29:54,261
remember.

1185
01:29:54,261 --> 01:30:01,793
BRIAN: There was a choice, right? Between going
and getting your armor probably made the

1186
01:30:01,793 --> 01:30:10,428
difference between Daxio being destroyed or not.
That was the Chest Piece of Gloriousness.

1187
01:30:10,428 --> 01:30:11,916
MATT: Plate of the Dawnmartyr.

1188
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:13,000
BRIAN: Thank you.

1189
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,484
MARISHA: I like Chest Piece of Gloriousness.

1190
01:30:15,484 --> 01:30:19,559
TRAVIS: You used it a billion times.

1191
01:30:19,559 --> 01:30:35,303
ASHLEY: Yeah. Getting that was huge. I mean, I
don't know how many times that I went unconscious

1192
01:30:35,303 --> 01:30:37,316
in battle after that, but--

1193
01:30:37,316 --> 01:30:38,481
LAURA: A <i>lot.</i>

1194
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:53,876
ASHLEY: A lot. And, you know, getting that vestige
was such a huge part of Pike feeling important in

1195
01:30:53,876 --> 01:31:00,125
battle. Getting the courage to go out and be in
the middle, and knowing that it would be okay if

1196
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:04,608
she got knocked out a couple times, and she'd be
fine.

1197
01:31:04,608 --> 01:31:09,140
TRAVIS: (as Grog) It is <i>not</i> okay if she gets
knocked out!

1198
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,508
MARISHA: Hey, Ashley, can I ask you a question?

1199
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:12,925
ASHLEY: Yes.

1200
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:17,504
MARISHA: What does the banner behind you say?
Because it looks like it says "boobs are magic."

1201
01:31:17,504 --> 01:31:23,989
ASHLEY: Books are magic! But both are true.

1202
01:31:23,989 --> 01:31:26,700
SAM: Can I ask you a question? Who was the guy you
were in love with?!

1203
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,722
BRIAN: Hey, we're going to get to that.

1204
01:31:28,722 --> 01:31:29,770
SAM: We are?

1205
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:31,725
BRIAN: You can ask her. I want you to ask her
instead.

1206
01:31:31,725 --> 01:31:36,810
ASHLEY: Sorry, I initially was trying to figure
out what question you were asking, Brian. Sorry.

1207
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,402
SAM: She's ignoring me.

1208
01:31:38,402 --> 01:31:40,267
BRIAN: Did you hear Sam's question to you?

1209
01:31:40,267 --> 01:31:42,951
ASHLEY: Oh, I did. I'm just not acknowledging it.

1210
01:31:42,951 --> 01:31:45,538
(laughter)

1211
01:31:45,538 --> 01:31:49,896
BRIAN: Matt Mercer, a question for you from
someone with three names, Stephen David Dugan...

1212
01:31:49,896 --> 01:31:56,413
LIAM: Can I ask a connected question to the armor,
to Matt? Senokir's box?

1213
01:31:56,413 --> 01:31:58,137
MATT: We're also going to get to that.

1214
01:31:58,137 --> 01:31:59,638
LIAM: That's later? Okay.

1215
01:31:59,638 --> 01:32:02,378
MATT: I hope we are! I hope we're getting to
that!

1216
01:32:02,378 --> 01:32:03,948
LAURA: Is that a later arc? Or is that the same
time?

1217
01:32:03,948 --> 01:32:11,927
BRIAN: Fucking let me do my job! I will get there,
goddamn it! Matt, Stephen David Dugan wants to

1218
01:32:11,927 --> 01:32:18,827
know-- you guys are keeping Stephen waiting-- "How
did Kevdak come to have the Titanstone Knuckles?

1219
01:32:18,827 --> 01:32:23,111
"What were his aspirations beyond being a dragon's
lackey?"

1220
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:33,229
MATT: I envision he got the Knuckles by beating to
an absolute bloody pulp the previous owner. It

1221
01:32:33,229 --> 01:32:41,537
could have been a chance meeting. It wasn't
something that he sought. The previous owner was

1222
01:32:41,537 --> 01:32:48,944
moving through the countryside in Tal'Dorei, got
waylaid by the Herd of Storms, and unexpectedly

1223
01:32:48,944 --> 01:32:54,760
was bludgeoned to death, and took them, and once
connected with these gauntlets, was like, "Oh. I

1224
01:32:54,760 --> 01:33:00,475
"can rise to prominence in this." Kevdak was not
the leader at the time, and then brutally worked

1225
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:06,463
his way up to become the person helming the Herd
of Storms. This would have been a young Kevdak. He had no

1226
01:33:06,463 --> 01:33:15,445
aspirations beyond that and just expanding the
herd, and taking what he wanted. Once the Conclave

1227
01:33:15,445 --> 01:33:21,559
came and destroyed most of what was society,
protected society, at that time, that was when he

1228
01:33:21,559 --> 01:33:26,187
saw the opportunity. Like, "These guards cannot
repel us. They are disorganized. They are focused

1229
01:33:26,187 --> 01:33:31,034
"on this other foe. Now's the time for us to
finally live like kings." That was when he

1230
01:33:31,034 --> 01:33:35,691
convinced the herd to charge Westruun with him.
They were unprepared for them, with a smaller

1231
01:33:35,691 --> 01:33:43,137
number of very focused and very powerful warriors,
and a populace where much of their guard had been

1232
01:33:43,137 --> 01:33:48,616
slaughtered or scattered, they carved right into
the heart and center and took over the city. That

1233
01:33:48,616 --> 01:33:50,816
was when they made the deal with Umbrasyl, in
which case at the time, he was like, "I will work

1234
01:33:50,816 --> 01:33:54,896
"with you." But of course, once you have that taste
of power, and having the gauntlets as long as he

1235
01:33:54,896 --> 01:34:00,470
did, he fully saw himself down the road destroying
Umbrasyl or bending Umbrasyl to his will, and then

1236
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:06,094
being, like, Dragon King Kevdak. I don't know if
that would have ever happened, but that's

1237
01:34:06,094 --> 01:34:11,585
definitely where he saw himself. It was a fast
power ramp in his mind of where he wanted to go

1238
01:34:11,585 --> 01:34:13,198
once he saw what he could do.

1239
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:14,729
BRIAN: Wow. So no dragon lackey for long.

1240
01:34:14,729 --> 01:34:18,065
MATT: No, not for long with that scenario.

1241
01:34:18,065 --> 01:34:20,332
BRIAN: Ashley, you had a question for Matt. What
was that?

1242
01:34:20,332 --> 01:34:27,418
ASHLEY: What's in the box?! That is the <i>one
question</i> that I had this whole entire evening.

1243
01:34:27,418 --> 01:34:32,683
BRIAN: She told me before the show. I told
everyone, if you guys have questions for Matt or

1244
01:34:32,683 --> 01:34:37,047
questions for each other, interject, those are the 
most important ones. Ash was like, "I have one

1245
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:41,052
"question, and it's 'what's in the box?'" What was
in the box of Senokir's wife's ashes?

1246
01:34:41,052 --> 01:34:48,361
ASHLEY: Yeah, it still drives me crazy. And when
we were coming back for the last part of the

1247
01:34:48,361 --> 01:34:55,173
wrap-up, and when we all met up and were like,
okay, this is what we did in our time off for the

1248
01:34:55,173 --> 01:35:03,131
last games, I was going to go look for the box and
I <i>forgot to tell you that</i> when we were all in to

1249
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:08,906
figure out what we were doing. We started the
game, and I was like, "Shit!"

1250
01:35:08,906 --> 01:35:16,243
MATT: Do you really want to know, Ashley?

1251
01:35:16,243 --> 01:35:18,483
ALL: Yes!

1252
01:35:18,483 --> 01:35:22,454
SAM: Another, smaller box.

1253
01:35:22,454 --> 01:35:27,115
MATT: Practically. No, it was his wife's ashes. He
was completely, 100 percent honest.

1254
01:35:27,115 --> 01:35:31,367
TRAVIS: Ah, no kaiju! No nothing, growing out of
the tree!

1255
01:35:31,367 --> 01:35:35,112
BRIAN: Was it the voice that made you guys uneasy?
For me it was the voice.

1256
01:35:35,112 --> 01:35:37,931
LAURA: He had that weird, like... (uneasy noise)

1257
01:35:37,931 --> 01:35:41,263
MATT: Not every NPC is out to fuck you.

1258
01:35:41,263 --> 01:35:45,662
SAM: He was so squirrely and weird!

1259
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:48,373
LAURA: I liked him. I really liked him.

1260
01:35:48,373 --> 01:35:51,281
TALIESIN: He was one of my favorite NPCs.

1261
01:35:51,281 --> 01:35:53,869
MATT: Oh my God, I don't know where he came from.

1262
01:35:53,869 --> 01:35:57,337
TRAVIS: You almost desecrated a <i>grave,</i> Ashley.

1263
01:35:57,337 --> 01:36:00,293
ASHLEY: I still don't believe you.

1264
01:36:00,293 --> 01:36:05,381
TRAVIS: Can't let it go! Yes, he is <i>real.</i>

1265
01:36:05,381 --> 01:36:07,187
TALIESIN: He made the jewelry I gave everybody.

1266
01:36:07,187 --> 01:36:10,714
LIAM: It's the other Horn of Orcus. That's in
there, man.

1267
01:36:10,714 --> 01:36:15,447
BRIAN: Liam. CainhurstCrow wants to know, "Were
you intending to multiclass into paladin before

1268
01:36:15,447 --> 01:36:17,318
"the events of the Raven Queen's tomb?"

1269
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:22,889
LIAM: I was strongly considering it. I hadn't made
up my mind, but I was leaning that way, because I

1270
01:36:22,889 --> 01:36:29,769
was already forming this new branch of friendship
with Pike, and being fascinated with the things

1271
01:36:29,769 --> 01:36:35,096
that she did, and I was feeling like such a-- the
same Vax who was saying, "What the fuck are we

1272
01:36:35,096 --> 01:36:41,668
"doing here? This is stupid. There is no purpose to
our lives," he saw that in Pike. First, people

1273
01:36:41,668 --> 01:36:45,812
were like, "I think Liam's going to go cleric!"
and I was like, "Nah. This is just part of the

1274
01:36:45,812 --> 01:36:51,442
"story." But then I started believing it myself.
And then, when everything... eh.

1275
01:36:51,442 --> 01:36:56,229
MATT: Yeah, because you'd even strapped a symbol
of Sarenrae to your hand at one point. You

1276
01:36:56,229 --> 01:37:01,186
were starting to push that direction of a faith
follower of Sarenrae.

1277
01:37:01,186 --> 01:37:07,340
LIAM: And without dragging everything out of the
store, rough time in my life, and when that

1278
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:13,218
happened, I remember we had a meeting. The group
got together like a week later, and I was not

1279
01:37:13,218 --> 01:37:15,730
happy about how that went down.

1280
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:17,114
LAURA: You were so mad.

1281
01:37:17,114 --> 01:37:20,802
LIAM: I wasn't interested in the armor, I didn't
want the armor. With everything going on for me, I

1282
01:37:20,802 --> 01:37:28,589
was like, "This is so heavy, on top of my heavy."
And it turned into this, I don't know, I wouldn't

1283
01:37:28,589 --> 01:37:32,627
trade it for anything at this point. But boy, it
was a tunnel.

1284
01:37:32,627 --> 01:37:34,391
MATT: I'm sorry.

1285
01:37:34,391 --> 01:37:37,807
LIAM: No! None of us know what we're doing.

1286
01:37:37,807 --> 01:37:41,445
MATT: It's just where the narrative went. I didn't
expect any of that to happen. I didn't expect you

1287
01:37:41,445 --> 01:37:46,058
to die, I didn't expect there to be a ritual, I
didn't expect it. And it was one of those things

1288
01:37:46,058 --> 01:37:50,262
where because it was in the Raven Queen's temple,
it would be any place where she would reveal

1289
01:37:50,262 --> 01:37:54,532
herself as part of this ritual, or an image of
herself, an avatar of herself. And then when you

1290
01:37:54,532 --> 01:37:59,709
made that decree, it was like, "Oh. She'll
accept." This changes the whole direction of the

1291
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:05,728
character and where that story for you was going,
on just one series of chance moments.

1292
01:38:05,728 --> 01:38:12,621
LIAM: Follow-up question. Fate-touched. Always
going to be a thing, or do you think that just

1293
01:38:12,621 --> 01:38:14,939
sprang out of that moment?

1294
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:21,341
MATT: No. To be perfectly honest, I decided on the
fate-touched thing because I knew you were going

1295
01:38:21,341 --> 01:38:25,513
through some hard stuff, and I wanted to give some
little special light to you.

1296
01:38:25,513 --> 01:38:27,539
SAM: Oh, Matt!

1297
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:31,821
MATT: I didn't know when it was going to come
up...

1298
01:38:31,821 --> 01:38:35,283
BRIAN: Oh, buddy. Don't go under there.

1299
01:38:35,283 --> 01:38:36,643
LAURA: I saw spiders.

1300
01:38:36,643 --> 01:38:39,764
BRIAN: Wow, that's really special.

1301
01:38:39,764 --> 01:38:43,270
MATT: I didn't know when it was going to come up.
I thought it might be more of a late-campaign

1302
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:48,433
reveal, like once things got more epic in scale,
and you were working with divinity, someone would

1303
01:38:48,433 --> 01:38:53,569
recognize and point that out, and would be like,
"Oh!" But that moment made complete sense, when

1304
01:38:53,569 --> 01:38:56,544
you made that decree to the Raven Queen. And with
her being the purveyor over fate, I was like,

1305
01:38:56,544 --> 01:38:59,291
"Well, this is the moment where it would come
up."

1306
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:01,362
LIAM: This fucking game.

1307
01:39:01,362 --> 01:39:07,864
LAURA: I have a similar follow-up question. Are
there any more cookies? Because I really want a

1308
01:39:07,864 --> 01:39:08,767
cookie.

1309
01:39:08,767 --> 01:39:09,936
BRIAN: You can go get them at the break.

1310
01:39:09,936 --> 01:39:10,973
LAURA: Yes!

1311
01:39:10,973 --> 01:39:15,669
BRIAN: You can absolutely have cookies at the
break. Travis: "During the Kevdak fight,"

1312
01:39:15,669 --> 01:39:21,360
CainhurstCrow wants to know, "did you initially go
in thinking you could win head-on against Kevdak?

1313
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,012
"Or did you always intend for Vox Machina to come
into the fray?"

1314
01:39:25,012 --> 01:39:32,031
TRAVIS: I had no idea. I just know I wanted to
face him head-on to start with. Even if it was

1315
01:39:32,031 --> 01:39:36,845
going to go south super fast like it did, I just
wanted to get an idea. And I was woefully

1316
01:39:36,845 --> 01:39:42,896
unprepared, especially when Matt was like, "You
realize that he is not taking as much damage as

1317
01:39:42,896 --> 01:39:48,116
"you think he should." I was like, "Oh, shit." It
was nice that everybody had taken up positions and

1318
01:39:48,116 --> 01:39:52,129
everything, and then I knew it would be a good
chance to just call in arms, and just trying to

1319
01:39:52,129 --> 01:39:59,689
set a little bit of a trap. But he got to face him
on his terms, and that's all I really wanted.

1320
01:39:59,689 --> 01:40:04,099
MATT: I was really rooting for you in that fight.
There was a possibility that Grog could have won

1321
01:40:04,099 --> 01:40:07,257
that one-on-one, but if I recall, the dice just
did not go in your direction--

1322
01:40:07,257 --> 01:40:13,719
TRAVIS: The rolls were not happening. He pinned me
on a spike, disarmed me. I only hit two times out

1323
01:40:13,719 --> 01:40:16,369
of five turns. Yeah, it was not going well.

1324
01:40:16,369 --> 01:40:21,538
MATT: I had considered both sides of it. If you
managed to take him down in one-on-one combat, it

1325
01:40:21,538 --> 01:40:27,271
would have been a very different scenario. Then it
would have turned into a temporary, very tense

1326
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:32,199
diplomatic conversation with the herd. But then
when you guys had finished the fight and destroyed

1327
01:40:32,199 --> 01:40:36,731
him and his right-hand man, it was like, all
right, we need to reevaluate this.

1328
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:42,480
TRAVIS: And we were learning what the Knuckles
did. I remember Matt saying, "You remember seeing

1329
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:49,724
"Kevdak reached out and crushed a guy's skull with
his bare hands." And I had no idea he would

1330
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:54,024
Enlarge, that the bloodaxe would also add all of
this stuff, and I was just like, "Oh, god, what

1331
01:40:54,024 --> 01:40:55,175
"did I step into?"

1332
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:57,183
LIAM: Such a ride though, that night.

1333
01:40:57,183 --> 01:41:00,522
MATT: It's one of my favorite moments in the
game.

1334
01:41:00,522 --> 01:41:03,383
TALIESIN: The toothpicks alone, those toothpicks
made me so happy.

1335
01:41:03,383 --> 01:41:07,691
BRIAN: Question for Laura from Aegis_of_Ages,
"When you found out you had been assigned a new

1336
01:41:07,691 --> 01:41:11,680
"alignment did you change the way you were playing
Vex?" I only ask you this question because you

1337
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,121
just rudely put food in your mouth during an
interview show.

1338
01:41:14,121 --> 01:41:16,262
LAURA: I don't think I deserved that change in
alignment!

1339
01:41:16,262 --> 01:41:17,637
BRIAN: Why?

1340
01:41:17,637 --> 01:41:19,368
LAURA: (chewing) Because it wasn't that bad!

1341
01:41:19,368 --> 01:41:20,418
BRIAN: What do you mean?

1342
01:41:20,418 --> 01:41:21,925
LAURA: (chewing) All I did was steal a broom.

1343
01:41:21,925 --> 01:41:22,992
BRIAN: All you did was what?

1344
01:41:22,992 --> 01:41:24,201
LAURA: Steal a broom.

1345
01:41:24,201 --> 01:41:27,843
BRIAN: That's all you did? How come it's still
brought up to this day if it was all you did was

1346
01:41:27,843 --> 01:41:29,511
steal a broom? Lots of people--

1347
01:41:29,511 --> 01:41:33,709
LAURA: I was going to give him a whole bunch of
dragon scales, but he walked away too fast!

1348
01:41:33,709 --> 01:41:37,975
BRIAN: I didn't understand a word of that, we're
going to have to move on.

1349
01:41:37,975 --> 01:41:45,662
LIAM: On my sister's behalf, I'm shocked that
Vex's alignment changed and Percy's did not,

1350
01:41:45,662 --> 01:41:49,980
because this guy is a fucked up motherfucker who
did fucked up shit left and right!

1351
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,609
BRIAN: That's true.

1352
01:41:51,609 --> 01:41:57,016
MATT: You can have fucked up thoughts, and not
necessarily act on them completely.

1353
01:41:57,016 --> 01:41:58,308
LAURA: He did though!

1354
01:41:58,308 --> 01:42:01,647
LIAM: He gave a sword to this dude, he shot a kid
through the hand! He's a lunatic!

1355
01:42:01,647 --> 01:42:03,895
MATT: Well the shot to the hand was--

1356
01:42:03,895 --> 01:42:07,388
TRAVIS: The sword is a gift, how is that bad?

1357
01:42:07,388 --> 01:42:10,939
LAURA: I think it changed because Matt
misunderstood my motivations for things.

1358
01:42:10,939 --> 01:42:14,385
BRIAN: Matt, do you feel like you misunderstood
Laura's motivation for things?

1359
01:42:14,385 --> 01:42:24,497
MATT: It's possible. But I considered a lot of
Laura's-- motions going in those specific moments

1360
01:42:24,497 --> 01:42:29,605
and a lot of things that had happened going
towards a series of selfish things that

1361
01:42:29,605 --> 01:42:32,322
didn't necessarily toward the betterment of other
people--

1362
01:42:32,322 --> 01:42:35,066
LAURA: Hey, that's a good point.

1363
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:40,553
MATT: --and that is the calling card of a chaotic
neutral character. If you had stolen the broom for

1364
01:42:40,553 --> 01:42:43,176
a greater good or a necessary purpose to save people
or--

1365
01:42:43,176 --> 01:42:45,808
LAURA: No, it was just because I wanted to fly.

1366
01:42:45,808 --> 01:42:48,806
MATT: It was purely because you wanted to fly. And
there had been a number of moments like that where

1367
01:42:48,806 --> 01:42:51,188
I had kind of been considering it for a while, and
that was a big moment where I was like, "All

1368
01:42:51,188 --> 01:42:57,708
"right, I'll knock you down." But once again,
alignment doesn't make a huge difference. I don't

1369
01:42:57,708 --> 01:43:02,312
think alignment should be a guide for the
roleplay, I think it should be reactive to the

1370
01:43:02,312 --> 01:43:08,530
roleplay. And more of an indicator. I agree with
elements of alignment in games, and I disagree

1371
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:13,182
with elements of it. I keep it in because it's a
relic of the times and it works as a decent guide

1372
01:43:13,182 --> 01:43:15,156
here and there, but it's not a big deal.

1373
01:43:15,156 --> 01:43:17,578
BRIAN: Yeah. Sam?

1374
01:43:17,578 --> 01:43:18,507
SAM: Yessir?

1375
01:43:18,507 --> 01:43:21,981
BRIAN: Question for you from Karraxx. "What was in
the letter that Scanlan gave to Pike?"

1376
01:43:21,981 --> 01:43:23,669
SAM: What was in the letter that Scanlan gave to
Pike?

1377
01:43:23,669 --> 01:43:24,573
BRIAN: Yep.

1378
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:25,629
SAM: I'll just read it to you.

1379
01:43:25,629 --> 01:43:29,234
TRAVIS: (incredulous) Oh, you got it? Oh, the old
digital device.

1380
01:43:29,234 --> 01:43:31,911
SAM: Let's see, mm-hmm. Okay.

1381
01:43:31,911 --> 01:43:33,175
LAURA: You just have it right there?

1382
01:43:33,175 --> 01:43:34,754
SAM: I figured this would come up.

1383
01:43:34,754 --> 01:43:37,506
(laughter)

1384
01:43:37,506 --> 01:43:45,639
SAM: Ahem. Dearest Pike, my entire life, I've been
half a man. Not in stature, nor confidence, nor

1385
01:43:45,639 --> 01:43:51,529
certainly not in reputation, but you see, even
though my heart has pumped blood for these 69

1386
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:58,914
years, it has done so only as half a heart. The
moment I first saw you was not a choir of angels

1387
01:43:58,914 --> 01:44:04,895
singing, nor silly butterflies fluttering in my
chest. No, the moment I met Pike Trickfoot-- I

1388
01:44:04,895 --> 01:44:09,820
haven't read this in a year-- the moment I met
Pike Trickfoot was the tragic moment I realized

1389
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:16,849
that my heart, my soul, would be forever
incomplete without you. For years, I've strived to

1390
01:44:16,849 --> 01:44:21,541
mend to mend my incomplete heart. To join it with
yours and find true bliss at your side. Though it

1391
01:44:21,541 --> 01:44:28,202
may not have seemed so, everything I've done these
past years has been to impress you, please you,

1392
01:44:28,202 --> 01:44:33,279
protect you. I knew early on it was a futile
effort, I'm not stupid. The entire world may be

1393
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:38,346
mad, but that doesn't nullify the laws of reality,
one law being that you are, and will always be,

1394
01:44:38,346 --> 01:44:45,801
too good for a poor penny-singer like Scanlan
Shorthalt. But even though I would not win you,

1395
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:58,806
your love, I could never stop trying. Does the sun
stop rising when the clouds blot it out? No. Like

1396
01:44:58,806 --> 01:45:03,432
me, it knows its purpose. To illuminate the world
so that mortals can witness such beauty as you.

1397
01:45:03,432 --> 01:45:04,728
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1398
01:45:04,728 --> 01:45:05,905
SAM: Jesus, this is good.

1399
01:45:05,905 --> 01:45:08,264
(laughter)

1400
01:45:08,264 --> 01:45:10,127
TRAVIS: You're getting laid tonight. By yourself!

1401
01:45:10,127 --> 01:45:13,807
SAM: But now, as the sun sets on my life--I guess
I was dying?

1402
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,452
TRAVIS: "You can't open it unless you die."

1403
01:45:16,452 --> 01:45:21,801
SAM: Oh, that's right! Okay, good. But now, as the
sun sets on my life, I have discovered something

1404
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:27,897
new. I have a daughter whose heart beats my blood
and whose life is my own. And she, unlike her

1405
01:45:27,897 --> 01:45:34,571
father, can be good and right and one day worthy
of your love, which is why, on my deathbed, I

1406
01:45:34,571 --> 01:45:40,481
leave her to you. Don't you see? This whole time I
thought I was chasing a lover, but instead, I have

1407
01:45:40,481 --> 01:45:49,529
been chasing a mother for my child. You, Pike
Trickfoot, are the savior to Kaylie that I could

1408
01:45:49,529 --> 01:45:54,505
never be. Your wisdom and honor and goodness can
give her the chance at redemption that I never

1409
01:45:54,505 --> 01:46:00,301
had. Pike, take my daughter as your own, show her
the light of Sarenrae. Guide her to be a

1410
01:46:00,301 --> 01:46:06,438
kind-hearted gnome. Teach her to be everything her
father was not. That way, in death, my-- oh, man,

1411
01:46:06,438 --> 01:46:07,601
I'm going to cry!

1412
01:46:07,601 --> 01:46:09,953
(laughter)

1413
01:46:09,953 --> 01:46:16,115
SAM: That way, in death, my heart will be
complete. And it will beat inside Kaylie, by your

1414
01:46:16,115 --> 01:46:21,766
side, like I always dreamed it would. With love
and respect, Burt Reynolds, Esquire.

1415
01:46:21,766 --> 01:46:25,816
(cheering)

1416
01:46:25,816 --> 01:46:33,679
MARISHA: How much is Scanlan repurposing that for
his vows?

1417
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:39,185
LIAM: Dani Carr just ascended straight to heaven
off camera.

1418
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:41,815
(laughter)

1419
01:46:41,815 --> 01:46:45,657
BRIAN: That was fantastic, well done.

1420
01:46:45,657 --> 01:46:48,301
SAM: I haven't read that since I wrote it. That's
really good!

1421
01:46:48,301 --> 01:46:50,651
(laughter)

1422
01:46:50,651 --> 01:46:53,813
BRIAN: It'll be hanging in several Critters'
houses soon, probably.

1423
01:46:53,813 --> 01:46:56,727
TRAVIS: Ashley, did you feel bad for reading that
early?

1424
01:46:56,727 --> 01:46:58,470
ASHLEY: Nope!

1425
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:01,881
(laughter)

1426
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:08,295
LAURA: Wait a minute. You wrote 69 in that thing.
And then in the wrap-up episode, you said you were

1427
01:47:08,295 --> 01:47:09,775
in your forties or fifties.

1428
01:47:09,775 --> 01:47:10,823
SAM: No, 70.

1429
01:47:10,823 --> 01:47:11,978
LAURA: Really?

1430
01:47:11,978 --> 01:47:12,945
SAM: Yeah.

1431
01:47:12,945 --> 01:47:14,020
LAURA: Okay.

1432
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:20,055
BRIAN: Matt, EvilGeniusReborn has a question. "In
your head, what vestiges did you intend to go to

1433
01:47:20,055 --> 01:47:20,946
"which player?"

1434
01:47:20,946 --> 01:47:25,602
MATT: I had some vestiges that were definitely
geared towards specific players, like Mythcarver

1435
01:47:25,602 --> 01:47:34,458
for Scanlan, the Titanstone Knuckles for Grog, and
the Spire for Keyleth. But when it came to the

1436
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:41,883
Deathwalker's Ward, the Cabal's Ruin, those were a
little more open. It was going to be between the

1437
01:47:41,883 --> 01:47:48,737
three of you guys. And there was the possibility
of someone doubling up on vestiges. With Fenthras,

1438
01:47:48,737 --> 01:47:53,058
that was probably going to go to you, but
depending on who wanted to focus on what, it was

1439
01:47:53,058 --> 01:47:57,707
either the opportunity of people swapping them, or
one person was better with a single vestige or

1440
01:47:57,707 --> 01:48:02,248
multiple vestiges, that could be decided. I didn't
know who was going to take Deathwalker's Ward, but

1441
01:48:02,248 --> 01:48:08,291
it was the first vestige you had encountered, and
it was probably going to be one of you five who

1442
01:48:08,291 --> 01:48:16,037
would use leather consistently. Other than those
few that were very specifically tailored for those

1443
01:48:16,037 --> 01:48:20,600
classes, I left the others open for choice and who
wanted to adopt them. And then once you had made

1444
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:23,446
the choice with the Raven Queen and the temple, it
was like, "Well, I feel like that choice is

1445
01:48:23,446 --> 01:48:24,775
"definitely made."

1446
01:48:24,775 --> 01:48:27,354
LAURA: Yeah, but it didn't go to you right away.

1447
01:48:27,354 --> 01:48:30,204
LIAM: No, you took it initially.

1448
01:48:30,204 --> 01:48:31,461
LAURA: Yeah, and then I gave it to him.

1449
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:32,505
MATT: That's right.

1450
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:35,327
LAURA: Yeah. And then I found out it fucking had
wings. Mother--

1451
01:48:35,327 --> 01:48:39,429
LIAM: A lot of disappointments in this game,
Laura.

1452
01:48:39,429 --> 01:48:42,582
TALIESIN: Did we exalt all of the vestiges?

1453
01:48:42,582 --> 01:48:43,916
TRAVIS: Everything that we had.

1454
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:45,018
MATT: Everything that you had.

1455
01:48:45,018 --> 01:48:46,236
TALIESIN: Okay, just curious.

1456
01:48:46,236 --> 01:48:49,109
LAURA: I like that there's other vestiges in the
world for the next campaign.

1457
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:51,678
MATT: Oh yeah, there's plenty of vestiges, good
and bad vestiges. They're everywhere.

1458
01:48:51,678 --> 01:48:56,574
BRIAN: Taliesin. A lot of people were interested,
and you didn't want to talk about it at the time,

1459
01:48:56,574 --> 01:49:01,324
but if this is the time and place, question from
@phorsi, "What did the party have to say to

1460
01:49:01,324 --> 01:49:03,858
"convince you to come back from the dead?"

1461
01:49:03,858 --> 01:49:07,681
TALIESIN: Oh god, it was less what they had to say
and what they could have said that would've made

1462
01:49:07,681 --> 01:49:12,925
him say no. There were certain appeals that they
could have made that I would've ignored.

1463
01:49:12,925 --> 01:49:17,406
MATT: I feel like religion was a big one.

1464
01:49:17,406 --> 01:49:22,211
TALIESIN: Religion was a big one. I was prepared
for any attempts to call upon a god to bring him

1465
01:49:22,211 --> 01:49:28,294
back, he would have been like, "No, no, no." But
it was all about finding reasons to come back. I

1466
01:49:28,294 --> 01:49:38,103
was really happy to let it be a 50/50 flip. I
could have gone either way. That could have been a

1467
01:49:38,103 --> 01:49:39,676
great end to that character.

1468
01:49:39,676 --> 01:49:43,122
MATT: It would have been a great end to Percy's
story. I had made peace with that end for him, and

1469
01:49:43,122 --> 01:49:47,867
we had talked about other character possibilities.
I think elements of your character in the next

1470
01:49:47,867 --> 01:49:52,378
campaign started as your alternative
character for Percy and decided to go.

1471
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:56,018
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

1472
01:49:56,018 --> 01:49:57,675
MATT: But when Vex dropped that bomb in the middle
of the--

1473
01:49:57,675 --> 01:49:58,856
TALIESIN: Yep, that did it.

1474
01:49:58,856 --> 01:50:01,858
MATT: It was like, "Well, that's going to be a
hard press for Taliesin to talk that one away."

1475
01:50:01,858 --> 01:50:04,538
TALIESIN: Yeah, that did it.

1476
01:50:04,538 --> 01:50:10,286
BRIAN: Matt. Concerning the dragons, Charlie John
Boychuk wants to know, "What would have happened

1477
01:50:10,286 --> 01:50:15,462
"had Vox Machina permitted Raishan her time with
Thordak's corpse?"

1478
01:50:15,462 --> 01:50:22,174
MATT: So what Raishan was doing with Thordak's
corpse was an ancient variant of Speak with Dead.

1479
01:50:22,174 --> 01:50:27,092
Now when you cast Speak with Dead, you rise the
spirit up and you can ask it questions, and it can

1480
01:50:27,092 --> 01:50:30,776
decide whether or not it wants to answer
truthfully or answer at all. What she was

1481
01:50:30,776 --> 01:50:37,094
concocting was a more intense version of that that
actually tortures and forces information out of

1482
01:50:37,094 --> 01:50:41,533
his soul. What she was trying to do was be given a
moment where she could extract information from

1483
01:50:41,533 --> 01:50:48,774
Thordak's soul. And the information she wanted was
the location of Opash's lair and what he wanted:

1484
01:50:48,774 --> 01:50:54,792
what was the secret, the secret to her-- it wasn't
Opash's lair, it was what was the secret to her

1485
01:50:54,792 --> 01:51:00,724
getting rid of the disease that she knew, she saw
in his eyes, that he was truthful about from the

1486
01:51:00,724 --> 01:51:09,747
very beginning. And that information was Opash's
lair, and when you interrupted her, she sealed you

1487
01:51:09,747 --> 01:51:16,728
guys off, continued with the ritual, got enough
information to get out of there to Opash's lair,

1488
01:51:16,728 --> 01:51:21,250
teleport there, and then got the rest of the
information she needed when she had absconded with

1489
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:25,480
it. So that's why when she left and she put the
force wall there, it was just to keep you at bay,

1490
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:29,467
just to give her enough time to get the
information she needed to know where to go, and

1491
01:51:29,467 --> 01:51:33,726
then took his corpse with her so she could get the
last bit of information when she had found herself there.

1492
01:51:33,726 --> 01:51:36,612
BRIAN: What were the significance of the eggs?

1493
01:51:36,612 --> 01:51:41,934
MATT: Oh, Thordak was mutating, Thordak was
becoming something new.

1494
01:51:41,934 --> 01:51:45,668
BRIAN: Yeah. Was the sickness real, or was that a
power play thing?

1495
01:51:45,668 --> 01:51:46,886
MATT: No, the sickness is very real.

1496
01:51:46,886 --> 01:51:48,204
BRIAN: Okay, okay. So the eggs--

1497
01:51:48,204 --> 01:51:52,399
MATT: The soul curse on Raishan was very real. And
Raishan was very, very desperate to find a way as

1498
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:56,648
it began to-- it was continuing to spread as the
years went on and she knew her time was limited,

1499
01:51:56,648 --> 01:52:04,238
and she needed to find a way out. And she, as a
natural deceiver, can see through lies at an

1500
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:10,064
instinctual basic level, and when her first battle
with Thordak led to Thordak saying, "I can help

1501
01:52:10,064 --> 01:52:16,425
"you with that. I know a way to stop that," which
was his eventual plan of becoming a dracolich.

1502
01:52:16,425 --> 01:52:18,675
BRIAN: Wow. And then the eggs?

1503
01:52:18,675 --> 01:52:22,569
MATT: And the eggs were an unexpected
circumstance. When they had put the soul anchor

1504
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:30,675
within Thordak and kept him in the Fire Elemental
Plane, the sheer force of elemental chaos began to

1505
01:52:30,675 --> 01:52:39,432
change him and shift him. And eventually, he began
to, in a Jurassic Park kind of way, no longer be a

1506
01:52:39,432 --> 01:52:45,657
particular sex, just began to become an entity
that gave birth to create progeny.

1507
01:52:45,657 --> 01:52:49,200
TRAVIS: Life finds a way.

1508
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:56,033
MATT: Life finds a way. So the eggs were, and are,
a representation of a new species, a primal

1509
01:52:56,033 --> 01:52:57,583
elemental dragon.

1510
01:52:57,583 --> 01:52:59,173
LAURA: And we killed them all?

1511
01:52:59,173 --> 01:53:01,428
MATT: You killed them all, as far as you know.

1512
01:53:01,428 --> 01:53:03,159
BRIAN: I hate that term.

1513
01:53:03,159 --> 01:53:05,820
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

1514
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:11,401
MATT: That means that's an invitation for anybody
who's playing a campaign in Tal'Dorei! That's for

1515
01:53:11,401 --> 01:53:14,453
any of you guys out there that are playing in the
game, that could be something.

1516
01:53:14,453 --> 01:53:18,054
LAURA: Fuck, we should have kept a baby dragon.

1517
01:53:18,054 --> 01:53:23,125
BRIAN: That is all the time we have to discuss the
Chroma Conclave. Now, we are trying to focus

1518
01:53:23,125 --> 01:53:26,697
tonight's discussion on, obviously, you guys
talking to each other and also discussing things

1519
01:53:26,697 --> 01:53:32,036
that haven't been talked about yet, either in
panels ad nauseum, or on previous Talks Machina

1520
01:53:32,036 --> 01:53:37,422
episodes or whatever. So if there's something you
feel like we didn't touch, we are now in where we

1521
01:53:37,422 --> 01:53:42,037
started Talks Machina, so you can go back, suffer
through the first few episodes, and then find joy

1522
01:53:42,037 --> 01:53:49,250
later in life towards episode 53, which was, I
believe, last week's. Character stats, as we end

1523
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:53,402
arc three. Grog rages: 86 total.

1524
01:53:53,402 --> 01:53:54,583
TRAVIS: 86 rages?

1525
01:53:54,583 --> 01:53:55,588
BRIAN: 86 rages.

1526
01:53:55,588 --> 01:53:57,604
SAM: Almost every session.

1527
01:53:57,604 --> 01:54:04,067
BRIAN: I would've thought more, right, but yeah,
almost every session. Pike healing: 3,658 HP.

1528
01:54:04,067 --> 01:54:05,481
TRAVIS: Dang.

1529
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:07,591
BRIAN: Vex arrows: 474.

1530
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:09,445
LAURA: Oh, see? So I had plenty left.

1531
01:54:09,445 --> 01:54:12,578
SAM: Well, there were some off-screen, I assume.

1532
01:54:12,578 --> 01:54:13,586
LAURA: Meh.

1533
01:54:13,586 --> 01:54:17,559
BRIAN: Now, I have to check with Andrew at
CritRoleStats to make sure this means what I think

1534
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:21,855
it means, but it says Percy misfires: 36.

1535
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:23,716
TALIESIN: That sounds about right.

1536
01:54:23,716 --> 01:54:29,429
BRIAN: DM facepalms? 264.

1537
01:54:29,429 --> 01:54:31,824
MARISHA: He did that more than you raged!

1538
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:33,973
LAURA: Oh my god!

1539
01:54:33,973 --> 01:54:36,572
MATT: That's what you guys do to me. That's your
fault.

1540
01:54:36,572 --> 01:54:38,448
MARISHA: Sorry.

1541
01:54:38,448 --> 01:54:44,278
BRIAN: Keyleth Beast Shapes: 110 times. What do
you think the most used was?

1542
01:54:44,278 --> 01:54:45,821
LAURA: Eagle.

1543
01:54:45,821 --> 01:54:46,819
TRAVIS: Planetar.

1544
01:54:46,819 --> 01:54:48,115
MARISHA: Earth elemental?

1545
01:54:48,115 --> 01:54:57,944
BRIAN: You're correct, 15 earth elemental times.
Scanlan inspirations? 136. And every one of them

1546
01:54:57,944 --> 01:54:59,681
fucking gold.

1547
01:54:59,681 --> 01:55:02,581
(laughter)

1548
01:55:02,581 --> 01:55:09,025
BRIAN: And Vax one-shot kills: 21. One-shot
kills.

1549
01:55:09,025 --> 01:55:10,970
TALIESIN: 21 friends we never got to make.

1550
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:15,299
(laughter)

1551
01:55:15,299 --> 01:55:17,242
LIAM: Those were 21 headaches I saved you all.

1552
01:55:17,242 --> 01:55:20,489
TALIESIN: 21 accents Matt didn't have to make.

1553
01:55:20,489 --> 01:55:22,869
(laughter)

1554
01:55:22,869 --> 01:55:27,995
BRIAN: Dagger? And then it ends there. That ends
our discussion on the Chroma Conclave. We're going

1555
01:55:27,995 --> 01:55:32,814
to take a break here. When we come back, I will
sit down with some of your favorite guest stars

1556
01:55:32,814 --> 01:55:35,066
from Critical Role. See you in a few.

1557
01:55:35,066 --> 01:55:40,072
(cheering)

1558
01:55:40,072 --> 01:55:50,975
MALE VO: A man in search of adventure. A woman in
search of her true self. A roguishly handsome

1559
01:55:50,975 --> 01:55:59,618
kobold king in search of that woman. A bard in
search of a tuning fork. From

1560
01:55:59,618 --> 01:56:07,249
Blizzard Entertainment comes an adventure of
togwaggling proportions. An epic saga of danger,

1561
01:56:07,249 --> 01:56:19,685
love, talking skeletons, terrifying catacombs,
kobolds, and thrills so supreme they'll take both

1562
01:56:19,685 --> 01:56:23,208
your candle and breath away.

1563
01:56:23,208 --> 01:56:24,821
BARD: Don't take it!

1564
01:56:24,821 --> 01:56:38,176
MALE VO: Written by King Togwaggle, directed by
King Togwaggle, starring King Togwaggle, and some

1565
01:56:38,176 --> 01:56:47,806
humans, and some other kobolds. This Groundhog
Day, don't pay for a whole theater seat: you'll

1566
01:56:47,806 --> 01:56:56,348
only need the edge. Kobolds &amp; Catacombs.

1567
01:57:12,551 --> 01:57:20,361
WHITNEY: Okay! If you're receiving this, I'm in
the apocalypse and you're watching Thrashtopia!

1568
01:57:20,361 --> 01:57:25,529
Thrashtopia is the only show in the wasteland that
has Whitney, weird technology, advanced AI

1569
01:57:25,529 --> 01:57:32,167
friendships, incredible sound effects, very
special or very scary guests, heavy metal, cool

1570
01:57:32,167 --> 01:57:39,120
art, your past coming back to haunt you,
apocalyptic educational videos, and a lot of other

1571
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,508
cool stuff!

1572
01:57:40,508 --> 01:57:46,340
JASON: Whitney! Remember that talking to a camera
is not an appropriate substitute for real human

1573
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:54,040
interaction. While talking to a camera may feel
like speaking to an actual person, in reality, you

1574
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:59,551
are alone. Alone. Alone.

1579
01:59:28,135 --> 01:59:34,516
BECCA: Get out them fancy clothes, light some
candles, and pour the absinthe. We're sampling

1580
01:59:34,516 --> 01:59:45,886
secret societies with Illimat from Together Studios.
This cunning card counter pits two to four

1581
01:59:45,886 --> 01:59:51,573
players against one another in a race to 17
victory points tracked on each player's side of

1582
01:59:51,573 --> 01:59:57,511
the game mat. Set up begins with a hearty shuffle
and three cards dealt into each of the four fields

1583
01:59:57,511 --> 02:00:03,634
of play. The dealer is chosen randomly and players
are then dealt a four-card hand. Except for the

1584
02:00:03,634 --> 02:00:08,140
player to the dealer's left; they only get three.
That's the price you pay for going first. The

1585
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:13,492
remaining cards become the draw pile. Next, four
Luminary cards are randomly dealt face-down and

1586
02:00:13,492 --> 02:00:17,850
placed in the corner of each field. The bottom of
the game box, known as the Illimat, is placed

1587
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:23,862
center, and four Okus Tokens are placed on top.
Align this box so the arrow is pointing to the

1588
02:00:23,862 --> 02:00:30,243
dealer. Illimat is played over a series of rounds,
usually two to three per game. Points are tallied

1589
02:00:30,243 --> 02:00:35,514
at the end of each round after players have
harvested cards from the mat. Here's the scoring

1590
02:00:35,514 --> 02:00:41,028
system. Four points to the player who harvests the
most cards. This is called the bumper crop. Two

1591
02:00:41,028 --> 02:00:45,663
points for harvesting the most Summer cards. Minus
two points to whomever harvested the most Winter

1592
02:00:45,663 --> 02:00:52,570
cards. Each Fool card, Luminary, and Okus Token
are each worth one point. Gameplay starts to the

1593
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:58,290
left of the dealer. Each turn, a player must
play one card from their hand and perform one of

1594
02:00:58,290 --> 02:01:03,810
the following actions. Harvest: by playing one
card from their one hand, a player can collect one

1595
02:01:03,810 --> 02:01:09,901
or more cards with the matching value from a
field. In addition to taking single cards, a

1596
02:01:09,901 --> 02:01:15,408
player can also collect combinations of cards from
a single field that add together to equal the

1597
02:01:15,408 --> 02:01:20,322
value of the card from their hand. They then add
the cards to their personal harvest pile for

1598
02:01:20,322 --> 02:01:26,592
points at the end of a rond. Sow: a player may
discard a card from their hand into a field.

1599
02:01:26,592 --> 02:01:33,001
Stockpile: by placing a card from their hand onto
an existing card on the field, a player can create

1600
02:01:33,001 --> 02:01:40,353
a single stack for future harvesting. This stack
acts as one card and cannot be separated. Stacks

1601
02:01:40,353 --> 02:01:45,433
can either be multiple instances of one value, or
individual cards combined together to create a

1602
02:01:45,433 --> 02:01:51,540
higher value. If a stack has multiple instances of one
value, it's considered locked on that value and

1603
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:58,518
cannot be added to as single cards. In order to do
any stockpiling, a player must also have a card in

1604
02:01:58,518 --> 02:02:03,523
their hand that matches the value of the stack.
Within these three actions, some other effects may

1605
02:02:03,523 --> 02:02:09,609
occur. For instance, if a face card was played on
a turn, rotate the Illimat so the season of the

1606
02:02:09,609 --> 02:02:15,321
field matches the season of the played card. Any
face cards from the star suit mean a player can

1607
02:02:15,321 --> 02:02:19,996
choose where to rotate the Illimat. Seasons also
have different effects on the field they face.

1608
02:02:19,996 --> 02:02:27,170
Winter means no harvesting over there. Autumn: no
sowing. Spring denies stockpiling. Of course, in

1609
02:02:27,170 --> 02:02:32,500
Summer, anything is possible. When harvesting, if
a player clears a field by removing the last card,

1610
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:38,774
a number of effects can occur. First, if any Okus
Tokens remain on the Illimat, the player gains

1611
02:02:38,774 --> 02:02:44,757
one. If the Luminary card in the field is face
down, flip it and resolve its effects. Effects are

1612
02:02:44,757 --> 02:02:48,097
listed in the rulebook. I'm not going to go over
all of them here, but they include things like

1613
02:02:48,097 --> 02:02:53,612
forcing the seasons to change and allowing players
to use two cards in a harvest instead of one. If

1614
02:02:53,612 --> 02:02:57,990
the Luminary card is already face up, the player
adds it to their harvest and resolves any of its

1615
02:02:57,990 --> 02:03:04,079
reward effects. The field is then reseeded with
three cards from the draw pile, unless the draw

1616
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:10,918
pile has less than three cards or the Luminary is
already face up. Ooh! A Fool of Summer! A Fool

1617
02:03:10,918 --> 02:03:15,127
card can either be a one or a 14, depending on
what you want it to be. If you harvest a Fool

1618
02:03:15,127 --> 02:03:21,652
card, you get an additional one point at the end
of the round. At the end of their turn, players

1619
02:03:21,652 --> 02:03:26,308
draw back up to four cards in their hand and play
passses to the left. This continues until all the

1620
02:03:26,308 --> 02:03:33,510
cards from the deck and the players' hands are
gone, then points are totaled for the round. Once

1621
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:38,927
a player reaches 17 or more points, they win! And
that's Illimat! I should mention this game was

1622
02:03:38,927 --> 02:03:43,491
commissioned by the band The Decemberists. That's
why I'm having Chris Funk and the game's creator,

1623
02:03:43,491 --> 02:03:48,438
Keith Baker, to play Illimat on a special Game the
Game on December 6th. You can watch this live on

1624
02:03:48,438 --> 02:03:56,151
twitch.tv/geekandsundry or projectalpha.com. Come
check it out and keep playing games!

1625
02:04:00,417 --> 02:08:41,580
[music]

1626
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:46,934
BRIAN: Welcome back, and please welcome some of our
favorite guest stars from Critical Role's journey

1627
02:08:46,999 --> 02:08:53,005
thus far: Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, Will Friedle,
Darin De Paul, Jason Charles Miller, and Noelle

1628
02:08:53,005 --> 02:08:56,764
Stevenson. Thank you guys for joining us. Thank
you for coming.

1629
02:08:56,764 --> 02:08:57,909
WILL: Thanks for having us.

1630
02:08:57,909 --> 02:08:59,144
MARY: We're not dead!

1631
02:08:59,144 --> 02:09:04,952
BRIAN: Well, there's still time. Before we get
into a few questions, we have to do a round of

1632
02:09:04,952 --> 02:09:09,098
quick plugs because you guys, you know, there's so
many people in the Geek &amp; Sundry and Alpha family

1633
02:09:09,098 --> 02:09:11,793
now. Darin and Amy do a morning show every Monday
at 8:00am.

1634
02:09:11,793 --> 02:09:16,778
DARIN: Monday morning at 8:00am. Really early on
Alpha. We do stuff. We have a couple episodes left

1635
02:09:16,778 --> 02:09:18,457
and we're really excited.

1636
02:09:18,457 --> 02:09:19,491
BRIAN: It's been awesome.

1637
02:09:19,491 --> 02:09:24,193
DARIN: Yes, it's been an absolute dream. Amy
Vorpahl is a wonderful partner and makes me laugh

1638
02:09:24,193 --> 02:09:26,848
harder than anyone I know. And it's just joy.

1639
02:09:26,848 --> 02:09:30,738
BRIAN: Some of the producers, Sean and Dani, were
telling me how much of a joy it is to get up at

1640
02:09:30,738 --> 02:09:36,173
4:30 in the morning on Sunday nights to-- No, but
everybody says, "If you have to come in early and

1641
02:09:36,173 --> 02:09:40,280
"do an early show, Darin and Amy are the best
people in the world to--"

1642
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:44,965
DARIN: We're very happy people, and also awful
people for being that happy, that early in the

1643
02:09:44,965 --> 02:09:45,809
morning.

1644
02:09:45,809 --> 02:09:47,213
BRIAN: Yes, absolutely.

1645
02:09:47,213 --> 02:09:49,124
WILL: She's really cool.

1646
02:09:49,124 --> 02:09:52,089
DARIN: She's really cool, and a great D&amp;D player
as well.

1647
02:09:52,089 --> 02:09:55,046
BRIAN: Indeed, yeah. Indeed. And Painter's Guild
is coming back?

1648
02:09:55,046 --> 02:09:58,458
WILL: Season two, Painter's Guild, January 8th,
yeah. We're bigger and better this year so it's

1649
02:09:58,458 --> 02:09:59,915
very cool.

1650
02:09:59,915 --> 02:10:01,645
BRIAN: Because you've been lifting weights? I'm
confused.

1651
02:10:01,645 --> 02:10:06,075
WILL: No, because before, where we had a table in
a hallway, that was literally it. So yeah, we

1652
02:10:06,075 --> 02:10:06,958
are--

1653
02:10:06,958 --> 02:10:08,352
BRIAN: Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah. There's a set?

1654
02:10:08,352 --> 02:10:12,416
WILL: We have a big old set and we're interviewing
guests and meeting some cool painters, some cool

1655
02:10:12,416 --> 02:10:14,501
artists, so yeah. It's a cool season.

1656
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:16,434
BRIAN: Jason, you've got Starter Kit too?

1657
02:10:16,434 --> 02:10:19,482
JASON: Starter Kit every Thursday and Thrashtopia
every Wednesday.

1658
02:10:19,482 --> 02:10:25,339
BRIAN: My god. And Noelle and Mary are unemployed
currently, have nothing-- No, we were just

1659
02:10:25,339 --> 02:10:29,732
talking, you guys both have several projects but
you can't talk about them.

1660
02:10:29,732 --> 02:10:33,522
MARY: Can't talk about any of them. We've got the
Kingsman chip in our necks. Our heads will

1661
02:10:33,522 --> 02:10:34,737
explode.

1662
02:10:34,737 --> 02:10:40,193
WILL: I can tell you what they are. I've signed no
such forms.

1663
02:10:40,193 --> 02:10:43,584
MARY: I know everything, therefore--

1664
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:49,495
BRIAN: It is funny to think about going back to
the beginning of Critical Role coming onto Geek &amp;

1665
02:10:49,495 --> 02:10:54,145
Sundry, and now thinking about the three of you
who have been on the show and now have your own

1666
02:10:54,145 --> 02:10:59,281
shows here, and how beloved you are from the
community-- and the two of you as well. When we

1667
02:10:59,281 --> 02:11:06,714
sent out and said, "Who do you guys want us to
have on as guests?" And everyone said Joe. No, I'm

1668
02:11:06,714 --> 02:11:08,099
kidding.

1669
02:11:08,099 --> 02:11:12,105
WILL: I figured. It would've been us sitting here
like this and you would've just seen the torso.

1670
02:11:12,105 --> 02:11:17,307
BRIAN: The tweet, Joe replied and said, "Everyone
better say me or I'll come after you."

1671
02:11:17,307 --> 02:11:19,305
WILL: He's a large fellow.

1672
02:11:19,305 --> 02:11:25,522
BRIAN: He is, yeah. Not next to Travis, though. I
was told I had to say that. What has been, for you

1673
02:11:25,522 --> 02:11:31,150
guys, the biggest difference between coming on a
show like Critical Role and playing D&amp;D at home or

1674
02:11:31,150 --> 02:11:34,966
maybe even a event stream or one-off or something
like that? What's been the biggest difference

1675
02:11:34,966 --> 02:11:38,956
between stepping into this behemoth than doing
something at home?

1676
02:11:38,956 --> 02:11:45,630
MARY: Well, it was my first behemoth. I mean, I
learned on the show. I'd never played before. I

1677
02:11:45,630 --> 02:11:49,315
had no idea what I was doing and it was just trial
by fire.

1678
02:11:49,315 --> 02:11:54,168
WILL: Me too. Exact same thing, I'd never played.
First time I played was on camera.

1679
02:11:54,168 --> 02:11:59,696
BRIAN: Going back, would you prefer to be thrown
in the deep end like that or-- Yeah?

1680
02:11:59,696 --> 02:12:03,338
WILL: I liked it, yeah. I mean, if you're going to
play.

1681
02:12:03,338 --> 02:12:08,872
DARIN: I liked being the character that I'd played
years and years ago. Because ultimately,

1682
02:12:08,872 --> 02:12:14,429
it's acting. It's what we do. It's a big improv
scene. It's "yes, and." So getting to work with

1683
02:12:14,429 --> 02:12:19,461
fabulous performers and creating a character and
creating an adventure, that's pretty cool.

1684
02:12:19,461 --> 02:12:24,081
NOELLE: I think the biggest difference is that
people actually care about your character, which,

1685
02:12:24,081 --> 02:12:28,429
if you play a home game and you're like, "Oh my
god, let me tell you about my sorcerer character,"

1686
02:12:28,429 --> 02:12:32,977
or whatever, and they're like, "Yeah, all right. I
don't know you. What are you talking about?" But

1687
02:12:32,977 --> 02:12:37,263
then all of a sudden, everyone's like, "Oh, I saw
your character! I love your-- Here's a drawing of

1688
02:12:37,263 --> 02:12:40,989
"your character!" I'm like, "This is like a dream come
true! This is so amazing! I didn't know that this

1689
02:12:40,989 --> 02:12:42,228
"was allowed to happen!"

1690
02:12:42,228 --> 02:12:45,834
WILL: It's like what they say with fantasy sports.
They say there's nothing more interesting than

1691
02:12:45,834 --> 02:12:49,685
your own fantasy team and nothing less interesting
than somebody else's. So that's what it's like

1692
02:12:49,685 --> 02:12:54,373
with D&amp;D. People come and tell you about their
home games and until I really played, I didn't

1693
02:12:54,373 --> 02:12:58,667
care. And now you kind of hear it and you're like,
"Oh, what are you doing?" And so you do. You want

1694
02:12:58,667 --> 02:13:00,747
to listen. You want to hear and all that good kind
of stuff.

1695
02:13:00,747 --> 02:13:03,609
NOELLE: It's like having a dream and someone is
like, "Tell me more about that!"

1696
02:13:03,609 --> 02:13:10,825
DARIN: Here's the thing. I'm breaking it down for
you. I'm getting real. When you play at home, you

1697
02:13:10,825 --> 02:13:13,115
don't get fan art. End of discussion.

1698
02:13:13,115 --> 02:13:22,380
MARY: With this, we're part of a community now
that is a continually expanding community of

1699
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:31,192
positivity and positive, world-creating building,
improvisation. It's creativity. And in times of

1700
02:13:31,192 --> 02:13:36,654
darkness, to create something is a wonderful
source of light, right? And it's a great community

1701
02:13:36,654 --> 02:13:37,868
to be a part of.

1702
02:13:37,868 --> 02:13:41,979
WILL: It's like when you go to a convention and
you walk around, you go, "Oh, there's millions of

1703
02:13:41,979 --> 02:13:47,697
"me." Because you think you're the only one that
paints minis or reads comic books in the dark and

1704
02:13:47,697 --> 02:13:51,894
then you walk around, you go, "Oh, other people
are dressed up too." It makes everything great.

1705
02:13:51,894 --> 02:13:56,691
DARIN: You're home. And it kind of feels that
way, coming on to Critical Role. It's like,

1706
02:13:56,691 --> 02:13:58,652
sharing a time with everybody, "Oh, I'm home."

1707
02:13:58,652 --> 02:14:04,301
JASON: I think playing the game with Matt as the
DM, it's a great game. But then what happens

1708
02:14:04,301 --> 02:14:09,131
afterward, that's really the difference of the fan
art, the people that are interacting, that are

1709
02:14:09,131 --> 02:14:13,107
talking about your character, that know your
character better than you. That's really the big

1710
02:14:13,107 --> 02:14:16,350
difference in playing a home-brew game and playing
it here.

1711
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:21,204
BRIAN: Everybody who's come on the show, even for
just one appearance, has said that that exact

1712
02:14:21,204 --> 02:14:27,869
thing has been one of the biggest impacts on them
afterwards, besides the amazing fan art that ends

1713
02:14:27,869 --> 02:14:33,004
up happening. Mary and Will, for you guys, what
was it like being on the show in the early

1714
02:14:33,004 --> 02:14:38,011
episodes versus coming in and being in the later
episodes? What was the biggest difference for you?

1715
02:14:38,011 --> 02:14:42,253
Besides not shooting on what looked like the
bedroom of a five-year-old.

1716
02:14:42,253 --> 02:14:49,334
WILL: And sharing a bench with somebody, half your
ass-cheek off one of the benches as Travis needed

1717
02:14:49,334 --> 02:14:50,351
space?

1718
02:14:50,351 --> 02:14:53,831
MARY: Well it was weird because I'd never played
before and there's Felicia Day and everything, and

1719
02:14:53,831 --> 02:15:01,766
I was terrified. Steve's whole philosophy of
parenting is just, "Keep your kids alive until

1720
02:15:01,766 --> 02:15:08,118
"they're 18." So my whole philosophy about D&amp;D was,
"Don't kill the team. Don't kill Vox Machina." And

1721
02:15:08,118 --> 02:15:13,833
I was more terrified about that than anything, you
know? But to be there, sandwiched between Laura

1722
02:15:13,833 --> 02:15:23,538
and Travis, I was home already. So I felt safe and
I felt inspired to fail, to screw up and to dive

1723
02:15:23,538 --> 02:15:26,569
in unabashedly and bravely.

1724
02:15:26,569 --> 02:15:32,166
WILL: My philosophy was smile, nod, and shift your
papers around like you know what you're doing. The

1725
02:15:32,166 --> 02:15:38,307
old shifting that-- all I was doing was shifting
my papers because again, the improv, I didn't have

1726
02:15:38,307 --> 02:15:42,171
a problem with. But then you get into rules, and
you get with somebody like Matt. I mean, the

1727
02:15:42,171 --> 02:15:47,218
perfect example was one of the episodes that we
did. We're there with Wheaton, who I think knows a

1728
02:15:47,287 --> 02:15:53,174
thing or two about D&amp;D as well. And at one point
it was apparently my cleric, I had no idea you

1729
02:15:53,174 --> 02:15:58,498
could Turn Undead. So at one point he looks at me
and he goes, "Turn Undead!" And it was like, "I

1730
02:15:58,498 --> 02:16:03,645
"don't know what I'm doing! Give me a break here!"
So it was that moment of just keep your mouth

1731
02:16:03,645 --> 02:16:07,913
shut, smile, be funny, and shift your papers
around until we figure out what to do. And you're

1732
02:16:07,913 --> 02:16:12,140
trying to figure out the spells and all that
stuff. It's a very in-depth game and when you jump

1733
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:16,375
right in the middle of people who know what
they're doing, it can be really disconcerting.

1734
02:16:16,375 --> 02:16:21,906
BRIAN: Just shout what you're supposed to do to
your other players! D&amp;D 101!

1735
02:16:21,906 --> 02:16:26,971
MARY: But then later on, when we came back, we
would get together and be like, "Okay, what are we

1736
02:16:26,971 --> 02:16:32,995
"going to do? Let's team up!" And I think that's
what sort of birthed their relationship.

1737
02:16:32,995 --> 02:16:37,819
WILL: When we teamed up, everything kind of
changed with playing because you and I formed a

1738
02:16:37,819 --> 02:16:40,565
bond and it was like, let's just go from there. So
that was helpful.

1739
02:16:40,565 --> 02:16:44,302
BRIAN: That's true, and that was a bond that the
community really resonated with.

1740
02:16:44,302 --> 02:16:49,309
DARIN: That was my first time actually on set
here.

1741
02:16:49,309 --> 02:16:51,375
MARY: That was the first time I met you!

1742
02:16:51,375 --> 02:16:54,902
DARIN: Yeah! We met for the first time-- we were
watching and you kissed--

1743
02:16:54,902 --> 02:16:57,536
WILL: Oh, that was the kiss scene. Kash kissed
Keyleth, yeah.

1744
02:16:57,536 --> 02:17:00,783
DARIN: And I was just going, "I wonder if I'll
ever be part of this world!"

1745
02:17:00,783 --> 02:17:05,485
MARY: "I just got into town! I like voice-over!
What's your name?"

1746
02:17:05,485 --> 02:17:09,692
WILL: That's when I realized how big the
community was, when Kash kissed Keyleth. I was like,

1747
02:17:09,692 --> 02:17:14,529
"Okay, two fictional characters kissed, no big
deal." And then artwork and everything, and it was

1748
02:17:14,529 --> 02:17:19,970
like, oh man. Yeah, it was a big deal. I didn't
know that was going to happen. It was kind of fun.

1749
02:17:19,970 --> 02:17:21,816
It was like, yeah, just kiss her and walk out.

1750
02:17:21,816 --> 02:17:22,920
MARY: But that's the fun.

1751
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:24,242
WILL: Yeah, it's great.

1752
02:17:24,242 --> 02:17:25,528
BRIAN: It is. That's improv, I mean, too.

1753
02:17:25,528 --> 02:17:29,204
MARY: We made up the pregnancy right before we
came on stage.

1754
02:17:29,204 --> 02:17:31,644
WILL: Literally right before we came on stage she
looked at me and she goes, "Zahra's going to be

1755
02:17:31,644 --> 02:17:34,295
"pregnant." I was like, "Oh, you've got to do
that!" And that was it.

1756
02:17:34,295 --> 02:17:36,521
MARY: Hiding behind the paint cans like--

1757
02:17:36,521 --> 02:17:40,498
BRIAN: Oh yeah, you guys were hiding back here by
the paint cans because the cast didn't know you

1758
02:17:40,498 --> 02:17:47,078
were here. Jason, in addition to doing the most
epic theme song of all time--

1759
02:17:47,078 --> 02:17:49,376
ALL: Yeah! (applause)

1760
02:17:49,376 --> 02:17:53,290
BRIAN: I have a question for you, but before that,
we had a moment in the office where I saw Jason

1761
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:59,038
before we started taping and his phone went off.
And he has the Critical Role ring tone. I was

1762
02:17:59,038 --> 02:18:04,333
like, hey, hell yeah, dude! That's a badass song!
You <i>should</i> have that as your ringtone! So for

1763
02:18:04,333 --> 02:18:10,915
you, going back, what was it like to play a
character who wasn't really on the same side as

1764
02:18:10,915 --> 02:18:15,415
the players? Wasn't necessarily on the same side
as the players?

1765
02:18:15,415 --> 02:18:22,131
JASON: Well, I mean, the problem really was I can
separate myself to a certain extent, but I love

1766
02:18:22,131 --> 02:18:30,942
everybody already. So I wasn't on the same side,
but luckily there was a uneasy truce because we

1767
02:18:30,942 --> 02:18:37,566
were all trying to survive at that point. And
maybe if he had continued, there might have been

1768
02:18:37,566 --> 02:18:44,746
some foul play, but at least for that moment we
were relatively on the same side, I'd say. Yeah.

1769
02:18:44,746 --> 02:18:47,580
BRIAN: What surprised you the most about that
episode?

1770
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:56,397
JASON: There weren't really too many. Actually,
what surprised me was I was sitting next to Liam

1771
02:18:56,397 --> 02:19:06,194
and he had the chatroom open. And I remember that
in combat, I called out that there was an attack

1772
02:19:06,194 --> 02:19:10,604
of opportunity for my character. And then chat
just went crazy, like, "Oh yeah, this guy knows

1773
02:19:10,604 --> 02:19:15,362
"how to play this game! He knows about attack of
opportunity!" So for me, it was the instant

1774
02:19:15,362 --> 02:19:23,452
commentary of every single move that I made in
that combat was immediately on Liam's phone. So I

1775
02:19:23,452 --> 02:19:24,984
thought that was pretty cool.

1776
02:19:24,984 --> 02:19:28,751
BRIAN: That's so weird. And what's crazy is Liam
was in a total chatroom that wasn't for Critical

1777
02:19:28,751 --> 02:19:33,577
Role at the time. He's a part of several of
those.

1778
02:19:33,577 --> 02:19:37,230
WILL: Fetish what?

1779
02:19:37,230 --> 02:19:44,958
BRIAN: I knew you would have one for me. Noelle,
talk to me about jumping into such an intense

1780
02:19:44,958 --> 02:19:48,697
episode, because you actually ended up being part
of the Nine Hells.

1781
02:19:48,697 --> 02:19:50,241
NOELLE: Yeah.

1782
02:19:50,241 --> 02:19:57,422
BRIAN: Why did you choose to play another prisoner
versus a plausible demon that lived there?

1783
02:19:57,422 --> 02:20:02,911
NOELLE: Well if I could have, I would've played a
shopkeeper or another shopper who might have been

1784
02:20:02,911 --> 02:20:06,372
maybe introduced in the episode a little sooner.

1785
02:20:06,372 --> 02:20:11,498
BRIAN: You got to answer a lot of emails, though,
before--

1786
02:20:11,498 --> 02:20:19,067
NOELLE: Yeah, it was like, "Okay, all right, no,
by all means, carry on." But no, that was actually

1787
02:20:19,067 --> 02:20:26,208
something that Matt told me that night, that I was
going to be a prisoner and they were going to meet

1788
02:20:26,208 --> 02:20:33,587
me, because that was part of my backstory. But it
was. It was really intense. I was playing Tova as

1789
02:20:33,587 --> 02:20:40,425
a burner character a little bit, where it's kind
of like, if she dies, it would be okay. It's the

1790
02:20:40,425 --> 02:20:43,789
only time I'm ever going to play a character
where, maybe I do want to go out in a blaze of

1791
02:20:43,789 --> 02:20:51,795
glory. A lot of it was trying to have fun, play
the game, but also try not to step on any of the

1792
02:20:51,795 --> 02:20:56,641
really big moments that were happening with the
team and try and help them get to their next big

1793
02:20:56,641 --> 02:21:06,021
thing. So I'm really glad I got to be there for
that last scene. It felt really important and,

1794
02:21:06,021 --> 02:21:13,015
even though Tova didn't end up going back with
them, it was a really moving moment. It was cool

1795
02:21:13,015 --> 02:21:14,287
to see.

1796
02:21:14,287 --> 02:21:16,067
BRIAN: And she survived, too, as we found out.

1797
02:21:16,067 --> 02:21:23,242
NOELLE: Yeah, canonically. It's true. She's alive.
She's, what, running a bear society? Not entirely

1798
02:21:23,242 --> 02:21:24,267
sure.

1799
02:21:24,267 --> 02:21:31,995
BRIAN: Some sort of weird bear-land type thing.
Yeah. I am interested, what's more nerve-wracking

1800
02:21:31,995 --> 02:21:38,375
or terrifying: starting the show at the beginning,
or waiting for your character to come in in the

1801
02:21:38,375 --> 02:21:43,033
middle of an episode, how some of you were
introduced? The waiting is really hard, right?

1802
02:21:43,033 --> 02:21:48,387
NOELLE: My heart was going so fast! I was like,
"Is that me? No, that's not me."

1803
02:21:48,387 --> 02:21:52,417
BRIAN: Oh yeah, whenever Matt says, "And you turn
a corner and you see--" Like, (nervous yelling).

1804
02:21:52,417 --> 02:21:58,083
WILL: Well, it's the difference in starting at the
beginning of the river, where you can get on the

1805
02:21:58,083 --> 02:22:02,573
boat slowly and go, or just jumping into the
raging part. So there's times when they're in the

1806
02:22:02,573 --> 02:22:06,981
middle of something huge and it's like, "Oh, and
then here comes--" And you walk in like, "Oh my

1807
02:22:06,981 --> 02:22:08,309
"god, we're right in the middle of this."

1808
02:22:08,309 --> 02:22:09,608
MARY: What if we screw it up?

1809
02:22:09,608 --> 02:22:13,806
WILL: Yeah, you're going to die because of me.
Because you said something interesting. There are

1810
02:22:13,806 --> 02:22:20,760
times you do go, all right, I'm a guest star. So
if I die, that's kind of okay and might be a cool

1811
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:24,575
way to go. And you do have that moment. And then
you're thinking, "Oh my god, what if I take one of

1812
02:22:24,575 --> 02:22:28,238
"them with me? Oh my god!" So it's pretty
horrifying as well.

1813
02:22:28,238 --> 02:22:30,687
MARY: We talked a lot about doing a Thelma and
Louise.

1814
02:22:30,687 --> 02:22:32,898
WILL: We thought about trying to go out in a blaze
of glory.

1815
02:22:32,898 --> 02:22:37,328
MARY: Well just, if somebody was on the verge,
we're just like, "All right, gun it."

1816
02:22:37,328 --> 02:22:41,610
WILL: But then I think I rolled a natural one and
we were both thrown off the cliff. That was the

1817
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:45,884
end of that. There we go. "Thanks for coming, now
leave."

1818
02:22:45,884 --> 02:22:54,256
BRIAN: That final Vecna battle episode, where we
had a few guests here, you were hidden from the

1819
02:22:54,256 --> 02:23:00,518
cast and we were in the back room and stuff. And
then Joe had this backpack with his Wyrmwood and

1820
02:23:00,518 --> 02:23:04,024
his player's guide and all this stuff. And then at
one point, we're all sitting in the back, and he

1821
02:23:04,024 --> 02:23:07,487
wasn't trying to hide it all. He grabbed all his
shit and was like, "Well, see you later, guys!"

1822
02:23:07,487 --> 02:23:11,383
And then he walked out and onto screen and we were
like, "Well, there goes that surprise."

1823
02:23:11,383 --> 02:23:15,532
WILL: We were trying. Mary was like, "I have to go
to the bathroom!" And then five minutes later it

1824
02:23:15,532 --> 02:23:17,240
was like, "I have to go to the bathroom!"

1825
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:20,016
BRIAN: You guys did great. And then I think
everybody caught on and it was like, screw it.

1826
02:23:20,016 --> 02:23:22,486
WILL: Did we tell everybody that, while we were in
the back room, we had a death pool going?

1827
02:23:22,486 --> 02:23:27,566
BRIAN: Yeah, we did. We talked about it. I think
we tweeted pictures of it, too. Darin--

1828
02:23:27,566 --> 02:23:28,763
DARIN: Hi, I'm Darin.

1829
02:23:28,763 --> 02:23:34,138
BRIAN: Yes, we should really start the show, by
the way. Your storyline really dealt with

1830
02:23:34,138 --> 02:23:42,631
redemption and that seemed to be embraced by the
fans in a really intense way that not a lot of

1831
02:23:42,631 --> 02:23:49,180
other, even characters or even some of the more
beloved NPCs that had longer, drawn-out storylines

1832
02:23:49,180 --> 02:23:56,709
were identified with. I think a lot of that has to
do with the sentiment that you had played 37 years

1833
02:23:56,709 --> 02:24:02,537
ago with Matt's mom in a game and all that stuff.
Talk to me about the experience of playing a

1834
02:24:02,537 --> 02:24:10,368
character who ultimately, I mean, lost everything
in one episode, only to find a purpose with Ioun.

1835
02:24:10,368 --> 02:24:12,180
Talk to me about that experience.

1836
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:17,570
DARIN: Coolest thing ever. Again, I thought that
when he was shot full of arrows, that was it. I

1837
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:23,310
went, "That's a great way to go out." And then we
got better and better and better and I love that

1838
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:29,256
he had redemption. Originally I thought of him as
Fagin, that he was going to steal everything he

1839
02:24:29,256 --> 02:24:35,834
could. But the goodness about everybody brought
out the goodness in him. Playing as an actor, I

1840
02:24:35,834 --> 02:24:42,429
would look over and Liam's face was in such
delight that it was a joy to watch. And I'm like,

1841
02:24:42,429 --> 02:24:46,979
"Oh, well, we're just going to have fun with
this!" And that he is still alive, that he's still

1842
02:24:46,979 --> 02:24:53,151
up there, and that he had this wonderful exit,
just arguing with Ioun, that's kind of cool. It

1843
02:24:53,151 --> 02:24:58,143
was a good little thing to play. I love playing
funny characters who are also tragic. I think

1844
02:24:58,143 --> 02:25:04,113
there's a lot of depth in that, and maybe that's
what resonated with the audience, that this utter

1845
02:25:04,113 --> 02:25:10,781
goof got to have his hero moment and got to cry
with Keyleth. I do that.

1846
02:25:10,781 --> 02:25:13,138
BRIAN: And looked so good while doing it, Darin.

1847
02:25:13,138 --> 02:25:19,510
DARIN: Thank you! Has anyone else worn fancy
clothes when they're playing?

1848
02:25:19,510 --> 02:25:22,533
MARY: I wore a white tuxedo jacket for the final
battle.

1849
02:25:22,533 --> 02:25:25,228
WILL: That's right, you did! I had pants on.

1850
02:25:25,228 --> 02:25:27,223
MAR: I had a She-Ra shirt on under it.

1851
02:25:27,223 --> 02:25:29,720
DARIN: So two of us.

1852
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:34,105
NOELLE: I wore my fancy flannel. You guys got the
good ones.

1853
02:25:34,105 --> 02:25:35,841
JASON: I wore my favorite hat!

1854
02:25:35,841 --> 02:25:37,282
BRIAN: There's a shocker.

1855
02:25:37,282 --> 02:25:39,572
WILL: We have to beg you to wear a shirt during our
home game.

1856
02:25:39,572 --> 02:25:43,092
MARY: I'm just hoping you wear pants.

1857
02:25:43,092 --> 02:25:46,592
BRIAN: Mary put a sign on the door that says, "No
shirt, no pants, no Brian."

1858
02:25:46,592 --> 02:25:49,498
WILL: We're only doing that because you roll so
poorly.

1859
02:25:49,498 --> 02:25:59,218
BRIAN: Wil Wheaton and I roll terribly. What is
something from your experience on Critical Role

1860
02:25:59,218 --> 02:26:04,364
this past year and a half that you guys will
definitely take with you? I know we talked about

1861
02:26:04,364 --> 02:26:09,476
the community, but what was something about being on
the show? It could be something hilarious that was

1862
02:26:09,476 --> 02:26:14,627
said, it could be a sentiment, or perhaps a hidden
crush on one of the cast members.

1863
02:26:14,627 --> 02:26:17,206
WILL: You weren't supposed to tell Travis.

1864
02:26:17,206 --> 02:26:20,511
BRIAN: I didn't. He can't hear; he's in the cone
of silence.

1865
02:26:20,511 --> 02:26:28,581
MARY: What's amazing is we're role-playing, but
there are these unbelievably emotional moments. We

1866
02:26:28,581 --> 02:26:38,127
brought Laura's character back to life. Just
crying! And it was like: I'm playing D&amp;D on the

1867
02:26:38,127 --> 02:26:46,496
internet and I'm crying! It's so moving. It's
great to just completely invest yourself in

1868
02:26:46,496 --> 02:26:53,470
something that you're making up as we go. I talked
to Laura about this a lot at a convention. I'm not

1869
02:26:53,470 --> 02:27:00,866
a writer, so this is the one thing that I've
created with the help of Matt as mine. With

1870
02:27:00,866 --> 02:27:07,043
everybody else, we create our character's
ensemble. It's amazing. Unique experience.

1871
02:27:07,043 --> 02:27:13,674
BRIAN: When you guys are out and about, going to
conventions or events, there's people everywhere

1872
02:27:13,674 --> 02:27:16,005
who come up and talk about this show.

1873
02:27:16,005 --> 02:27:17,814
WILL: Dress like our characters!

1874
02:27:17,814 --> 02:27:21,427
MARY: They named a puppy Zahra! I mean, come on!

1875
02:27:21,427 --> 02:27:23,395
WILL: It's nuts.

1876
02:27:23,395 --> 02:27:27,237
BRIAN: And still making art and everything else.
It's crazy.

1877
02:27:27,237 --> 02:27:33,584
DARIN: They'll come up and be in tears. No, this
was as special for all of us as it was for you and

1878
02:27:33,584 --> 02:27:37,118
thank you for embracing these characters. Taking
them to here and here.

1879
02:27:37,118 --> 02:27:43,314
JASON: I was playing a concert in Baltimore and
someone yelled out, "We love you, Garthok!" Okay,

1880
02:27:43,314 --> 02:27:45,313
awesome!

1881
02:27:45,313 --> 02:27:46,955
WILL: It's crazy!

1882
02:27:46,955 --> 02:27:48,433
MARY: That's amazing.

1883
02:27:48,433 --> 02:27:53,842
WILL: I have to say, what I will take away, as
much as I love the game and it's completely

1884
02:27:53,842 --> 02:28:01,066
transformed certain aspects of my life because we
have our home game. I knew Matt well because we

1885
02:28:01,066 --> 02:28:05,701
did Thundercats together, but I knew Travis and
Laura, I'd met all these people, but I didn't know

1886
02:28:05,701 --> 02:28:11,380
them well. So getting to know them and becoming
close to them and friends with all of them, that's

1887
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:16,903
what I'll take away. I feel like I've gotten all
new friends of out this-- you and Mary! I've got a

1888
02:28:16,903 --> 02:28:22,255
whole new set of friends out of this, which is
something I'll take with me forever. D&amp;D is

1889
02:28:22,255 --> 02:28:25,781
amazing. Critical Role is amazing. The
relationships it's formed is something I'll never

1890
02:28:25,781 --> 02:28:26,948
forget.

1891
02:28:26,948 --> 02:28:32,153
BRIAN: Our game is one of the hundreds or more
started because of this show.

1892
02:28:32,153 --> 02:28:40,759
DARIN: I knew working with Matt in my episode was going
to be delightful and I wanted to have a moment

1893
02:28:40,759 --> 02:28:46,363
with Marisha. That was my aim because I think
she's a wonderful actress, capable of so many

1894
02:28:46,363 --> 02:28:54,499
things. That was my favorite thing. When she
thought she had killed me and we were just weeping

1895
02:28:54,499 --> 02:29:01,513
and in tears and going, "It's okay!" We're just
there and we couldn't touch and it was just-- this

1896
02:29:01,513 --> 02:29:06,663
is acting, this Broadway, this is a scene! I hope
you appreciate it because it's really good!

1897
02:29:06,663 --> 02:29:11,953
BRIAN: You know when you feel it. You go, I hope it's
coming across as strongly as I feel it.

1898
02:29:11,953 --> 02:29:16,654
DARIN: You hope that the picture you're painting
in your mind other people are because it's so

1899
02:29:16,654 --> 02:29:24,380
vivid and wonderful. I would sit home and watch
these guys on the show and marvel in it. I was a

1900
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:27,191
huge fan before I even got the opportunity to go
on.

1901
02:29:27,191 --> 02:29:30,614
BRIAN: I remember one of the first nights of Talks
Machina, I come on the set and Darin is taking

1902
02:29:30,614 --> 02:29:35,753
pictures. I go, what's going on? He goes, "Sorry,
dude! Can I take some pictures?" I'm like: Yes,

1903
02:29:35,753 --> 02:29:41,363
dude! I'm so honored to meet you! What the fuck?!
He just showed up and he's geeking out over all

1904
02:29:41,363 --> 02:29:44,006
the trinkets we have. No pun intended.

1905
02:29:44,006 --> 02:29:51,463
DARIN: I'm just mouth-stupid. I told Matt: it's my
theater, coming from theater in New York. I was

1906
02:29:51,463 --> 02:29:59,278
like: this is what I watched on Thursday for the
story and characters. And it was theater for me. I

1907
02:29:59,278 --> 02:30:01,955
loved how it evolved and the tragedy, the comedy.

1908
02:30:01,955 --> 02:30:06,773
WILL: Good story's good story. I don't care what
medium it comes in. Good story's good story, plain

1909
02:30:06,773 --> 02:30:07,869
and simple.

1910
02:30:07,869 --> 02:30:13,961
NOELLE: There's a universality-- what am I trying
to say? Universal nature to D&amp;D that is all the

1911
02:30:13,961 --> 02:30:19,303
stories are different. Every game is different.
Every DM runs things a different way, but there is

1912
02:30:19,303 --> 02:30:24,195
this familiarity to everything. We were talking
about this before. When Mary and I met for the

1913
02:30:24,195 --> 02:30:27,501
first time, and it was like, "Okay, we're going to
work together. What's that going to be like?" I

1914
02:30:27,501 --> 02:30:33,284
think she was wearing a d20 necklace, so I was
like, oh you play! She's like, "I'm a tiefling

1915
02:30:33,284 --> 02:30:41,062
"warlock!" and I was like "I'm a tiefling warlock!"
And that was all we talked about for the rest of

1916
02:30:41,062 --> 02:30:45,497
the day! Everyone else in the room was like, "What
the fuck's going on?"

1917
02:30:45,497 --> 02:30:48,664
MARY: Do we now want to keep talking about the show?

1918
02:30:48,664 --> 02:30:55,252
NOELLE: The job? The show? And it's like, oh no,
hang on. What about that infernal? There's

1919
02:30:55,252 --> 02:31:03,052
something that you recognize and everyone's
experience with it is different. I was pretty new

1920
02:31:03,052 --> 02:31:09,505
to D&amp;D, too, it was the second character I'd ever
played on Critical Role. But it was the community

1921
02:31:09,505 --> 02:31:13,370
and the way that people connected with that because
it was familiar, it was recognizable in some way.

1922
02:31:13,370 --> 02:31:21,314
That was what elevated it. It's not just about you
and your character, it's about contributing to

1923
02:31:21,314 --> 02:31:27,987
this much bigger thing. Even outside of Critical
Role, to the wider D&amp;D world. That's what people see

1924
02:31:27,987 --> 02:31:33,668
themselves in. That's something that's really
special. That's something I'll take away and

1925
02:31:33,668 --> 02:31:36,961
continue to treasure about D&amp;D in general.

1926
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:39,153
WILL: Anything positive in this world is so
beautiful!

1927
02:31:39,153 --> 02:31:41,217
BRIAN: I completely agree.

1928
02:31:41,217 --> 02:31:46,316
WILL: It's such a wonderful thing. We need more of
it. If it comes with you and your friends sitting

1929
02:31:46,316 --> 02:31:48,163
down and playing a game, that's what you do.

1930
02:31:48,163 --> 02:31:51,532
NOELLE: Collaborating with people to create
something like a story, it means something.

1931
02:31:51,532 --> 02:31:58,775
BRIAN: I want to live in a world where we
continue to engage the imagination in a way that

1932
02:31:58,775 --> 02:32:01,991
doesn't involve us simply being a participant.

1933
02:32:01,991 --> 02:32:04,041
MARY: Or an observer.

1934
02:32:04,041 --> 02:32:08,924
BRIAN: Yeah, that's what I meant. Watching TV
versus being the story.

1935
02:32:08,924 --> 02:32:13,170
MARY: Watching people play games or whatever, it's
getting involved! Make your own game!

1936
02:32:13,170 --> 02:32:16,233
WILL: Waking up every morning and saying, "I will
create."

1937
02:32:16,233 --> 02:32:20,543
DARIN: That's what happens with this game with
these performers is total commitment to character.

1938
02:32:20,543 --> 02:32:27,578
It's not, I'm a joke character with a joke name and
I'm just here to add some jokes. No, I am in this

1939
02:32:27,578 --> 02:32:31,167
world 100% and I want to convey that.

1940
02:32:31,167 --> 02:32:37,352
BRIAN: And all of you did beautifully. Thank you
for joining us for this special wrap-up.

1941
02:32:37,352 --> 02:32:38,720
DARIN: We should really start.

1942
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:44,763
BRIAN: We're going to as soon as I've had my
coffee. Thank you guys for joining us so much.

1943
02:32:44,763 --> 02:32:49,716
MARY: Is that it? I had a whole thing on what the
Moon Hammer was about. Another time. We'll get to

1944
02:32:49,716 --> 02:32:51,499
it another time.

1945
02:32:51,499 --> 02:32:53,866
NOELLE: I wrote a song and a tap dance. Do I get
to do that?

1946
02:32:53,866 --> 02:32:56,005
JASON: I brought Garthok's lineage.

1947
02:32:56,005 --> 02:32:57,885
DARIN: That's the song.

1948
02:32:57,885 --> 02:33:01,794
BRIAN: The song is a musical version of Garthok's
lineage.

1949
02:33:01,794 --> 02:33:12,820
DARIN: (singing) Garthok's lineage! It's a thing
that we do when we're old! Garthok's lineage! He

1950
02:33:12,820 --> 02:33:17,700
was a thief! He was really bold! Garthok's
lineage!

1951
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:25,099
BRIAN: And that's canon, folks, Matt just
confirmed off-screen for me. Thank you to our

1952
02:33:25,099 --> 02:33:29,085
guests for joining us this evening. We're going to
take another quick break, show a commercial, and

1953
02:33:29,085 --> 02:33:37,322
be back with the casht-- Kasht? No, you got to
leave. You got to go home and start doing pushups

1954
02:33:37,322 --> 02:33:39,328
for tomorrow night.

1955
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:40,925
MARY: We're puppets!

1956
02:33:40,925 --> 02:33:45,969
BRIAN: I know! We're back with the cast to finish
discussing arcs four and five. See you in a few.

1957
02:33:59,918 --> 02:34:07,229
MATT: Legends tell of a vast, underground world
and the countless treasures that lie in store for

1958
02:34:07,229 --> 02:34:17,115
worthy adventurers. (singing) You've signed up the
best. You're on a great quest to find the mighty

1959
02:34:17,115 --> 02:34:26,212
motherlode. There's treasure galore, but peril's
in store and construction that isn't up to code.

1960
02:34:26,212 --> 02:34:32,302
Trespass with care, there should be something
rare, you can grab all the loot that you can

1961
02:34:32,302 --> 02:34:38,883
handle. Such riches you'll own, but leave one
thing alone.

1962
02:34:38,883 --> 02:34:45,240
KOBOLDS: You. No. Take. Candle!

1963
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:51,711
MATT: (singing) And if you steal their light, you
then must take flight, eluding each hazard and

1964
02:34:51,711 --> 02:34:56,862
each trap. It's a chaotic race as the monsters
give chase, and all the while you're trying to

1965
02:34:56,862 --> 02:35:02,186
follow the map. They're gaining on you, your
options are few, and you fear that you're never

1966
02:35:02,186 --> 02:35:10,436
going to get home. You sought after wealth, but
you lose all your health to kobolds &amp; catacombs!

1967
02:35:10,436 --> 02:35:17,509
It's Kobolds &amp; Catacombs!

1968
02:35:28,007 --> 02:35:32,921
GILMORE: Hello Tal'Dorians! We have an exciting

Lady Ioana Muresan. Printed on the finest

2008
02:39:52,507 --> 02:40:01,085
BRIAN: Our first question is for Sam. This comes
from @_quietbatpeople. "If Revivify had been

2009
02:40:01,085 --> 02:40:06,840
"successful in the second fight against Raishan and
Scanlan hadn't had to go through the res ritual,

2010
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:13,804
"would he still have left Vox Machina? Was it the
act of dying or the circumstances surrounding the

2011
02:40:13,804 --> 02:40:16,229
"ritual (Kaylie, etc.) that were more influential?"

2012
02:40:16,229 --> 02:40:28,366
SAM: This is so exciting! For me! It was the act
of dying that pushed him over the edge. He was not

2013
02:40:28,366 --> 02:40:36,636
present for the revivify ritual, so he does not
know what happened in it, not really. He heard

2014
02:40:36,636 --> 02:40:37,941
distant voices.

2015
02:40:37,941 --> 02:40:39,492
LAURA: Only the ones that succeeded.

2016
02:40:39,492 --> 02:40:40,673
SAM: Yeah. Sorry, Travis.

2017
02:40:40,673 --> 02:40:42,010
TRAVIS: That hurts.

2018
02:40:42,010 --> 02:40:55,007
SAM: No, it was the dying. There was a long
buildup to him leaving. He had discovered his

2019
02:40:55,007 --> 02:41:04,538
daughter. It brought it front and center that he
was a shithead for most of his life. The gang

2020
02:41:04,538 --> 02:41:16,495
didn't really listen to him that much. He was
doing stuff with drugs, or trying to, anyway. Then

2021
02:41:16,495 --> 02:41:21,727
he had this terrible streak. Didn't he die twice
in a row? Or get knocked out a bunch of times? He

2022
02:41:21,727 --> 02:41:28,900
didn't even have that any more. He didn't have his
mojo. Pike had said no. It was a whole big bunch

2023
02:41:28,900 --> 02:41:37,289
of stuff that was not going well for young
Shorthalt. Then to get knocked down again. He

2024
02:41:37,289 --> 02:41:45,679
can't even help his people in battle! What use is
he? He's nothing. He should have walked away. And

2025
02:41:45,679 --> 02:41:50,301
then they made fun of him when he woke up! Oh my
god! Terrible!

2026
02:41:50,301 --> 02:41:52,227
BRIAN: You would've done the same, though!

2027
02:41:52,227 --> 02:41:53,224
SAM: Oh yeah.

2028
02:41:53,224 --> 02:41:57,231
TALIESIN: I was waiting for that! Thank you!

2029
02:41:57,231 --> 02:42:00,856
SAM: Yeah, but in the moment it seemed
particularly bad.

2030
02:42:00,856 --> 02:42:02,526
MARISHA: Sure.

2031
02:42:02,526 --> 02:42:09,197
BRIAN: "Matt: regarding the kraken,"
@hawaiianxngel wants to know, "could Vox Machina

2032
02:42:09,197 --> 02:42:12,152
"have had the chance of killing it (even though
they weren't supposed to)? What would have

2033
02:42:12,152 --> 02:42:13,881
"happened if the kraken died?"

2034
02:42:13,881 --> 02:42:18,932
MATT: They totally could have. If circumstances
allowed them to or if they decided to. If the

2035
02:42:18,932 --> 02:42:26,592
kraken had died, the lodestone sources that both
prevent the expansion of the rift between the

2036
02:42:26,592 --> 02:42:32,666
water elemental plane and the ocean there would
have been lost. The lodestones do slowly

2037
02:42:32,666 --> 02:42:39,860
degenerate over time. They also keep Vesrah aloft
above the ocean. It would've begun to sink.

2038
02:42:39,860 --> 02:42:43,201
MARISHA: That's why I kept screaming, "Don't kill
the fucking kraken, Grog!"

2039
02:42:43,201 --> 02:42:46,672
MATT: It wouldn't have been immediate. It wasn't
like all of sudden it dies and it collapses. Over

2040
02:42:46,672 --> 02:42:51,674
the next five or so years when they began to
degenerate, and they wouldn't have had a source.

2041
02:42:51,674 --> 02:42:55,004
The would have had to find another kraken and
either continue to farm in that area or lure one

2042
02:42:55,004 --> 02:42:59,587
closer to the rift. It would have fucked up their
entire ecosystem and would've had to find a new

2043
02:42:59,587 --> 02:43:00,819
way to do it.

2044
02:43:00,819 --> 02:43:07,247
MARISHA: Go find another kraken. Giant squid. Go
find a second one.

2045
02:43:07,247 --> 02:43:11,661
BRIAN: Plenty of krakens in the sea, as my
grandmother used to say. Ashley, a question for

2046
02:43:11,661 --> 02:43:21,775
you before bedtime from Shackleface. Which is
technically Ashley's pet name for me. "You've

2047
02:43:21,775 --> 02:43:27,457
"mentioned that if you'd been able to be there for
Scanlan's departure, Pike would've had a few

2048
02:43:27,457 --> 02:43:31,127
"things to say to him. What sort of things would
you have said?"

2049
02:43:31,127 --> 02:43:45,186
ASHLEY: I feel like I got into that as we played
some games with Scanlan again. I think Grog and

2050
02:43:45,186 --> 02:43:58,409
Pike were so hurt. I think me as a player was--
hi. I think me as a player, I was bummed because I

2051
02:43:58,409 --> 02:44:07,502
was gone so much and then he left while I was gone
and then there was this new guy. I mean, Taryon

2052
02:44:07,502 --> 02:44:17,495
was great, but come on, I want to play with
Scanlan. I know I said a lot of the things in one

2053
02:44:17,495 --> 02:44:26,660
of the later games after he came back. Once Pike
got the courage. I don't know. That's one of those

2054
02:44:26,660 --> 02:44:32,909
things that you never know that maybe-- I don't
think Pike would have been able to stop him. He

2055
02:44:32,909 --> 02:44:35,179
was going to go no matter what.

2056
02:44:35,179 --> 02:44:38,962
BRIAN: Sam, any thoughts?

2057
02:44:38,962 --> 02:44:42,148
SAM: She could've probably stopped me.

2058
02:44:42,148 --> 02:44:47,901
MARISHA: She would've been the only one, right?

2059
02:44:47,901 --> 02:44:51,414
SAM: She's probably the only one who could've
stopped me.

2060
02:44:51,414 --> 02:44:58,505
MARISHA: I remember deep into that conversation, I
remember all of us reaching this point of, "We're

2061
02:44:58,505 --> 02:45:00,286
"talking in circles, you're going to leave."

2062
02:45:00,286 --> 02:45:08,079
SAM: You helped! You changed the trajectory of
what I was going to do. I was just going to go off

2063
02:45:08,079 --> 02:45:13,355
and then little Vexy said, "Why don't you go
spend some time with your daughter?" And I was

2064
02:45:13,355 --> 02:45:15,110
like, "Oh, that's a good idea."

2065
02:45:15,110 --> 02:45:23,201
BRIAN: Matt, question for you from @Luap82517.
"What would have happened if Keyleth had failed

2066
02:45:23,201 --> 02:45:25,819
"her Aramente trial. Would she have been able to
try again?"

2067
02:45:25,819 --> 02:45:32,531
MATT: No, actually. In failing the Aramente,
Keyleth would've stepped aside. She could still

2068
02:45:32,531 --> 02:45:39,865
join whatever small council there is to the Air
Ashari alongside her father, Korren. But somebody

2069
02:45:39,865 --> 02:45:43,841
else would've been chosen to take on the Aramente
to become the next leader.

2070
02:45:43,841 --> 02:45:45,456
LAURA: Damn, that would've sucked!

2071
02:45:45,456 --> 02:45:50,666
MARISHA: It's not meant to be redone at all.

2072
02:45:50,666 --> 02:45:57,622
MATT: It's not always blood-related. Classically,
it's a generational thing. But it also can go to

2073
02:45:57,622 --> 02:46:01,150
whoever is the most worthy and willing to take the
Aramente.

2074
02:46:01,150 --> 02:46:02,447
MARISHA: You have the choice to tap out.

2075
02:46:02,447 --> 02:46:05,899
MATT: You can say no if you don't feel like you
want to.

2076
02:46:05,899 --> 02:46:10,299
MARISHA: Once again, Keyleth got close several
times to being like, "Fuck this!"

2077
02:46:10,299 --> 02:46:16,208
BRIAN: Laura, question for you from
ThisTinSoldier. "This arc is where Vex saw the

2078
02:46:16,208 --> 02:46:20,826
"true face of wealth in Tary's arsenal and his pomp
and attitude. Was this one of the deciding factors

2079
02:46:20,826 --> 02:46:24,257
"that mellowed her money-grubbing tendencies?"

2080
02:46:24,257 --> 02:46:26,158
LAURA: Nah.

2081
02:46:26,158 --> 02:46:27,867
BRIAN: Matt, question for you.

2082
02:46:27,867 --> 02:46:38,536
LAURA: No! I mean, no. Once she got money, that's
what mellowed her out. Once she became rich enough

2083
02:46:38,536 --> 02:46:42,570
that she didn't have to fucking worry about paying
for things anymore, she was like, "Okay. This is

2084
02:46:42,570 --> 02:46:43,792
"what it's like."

2085
02:46:43,792 --> 02:46:49,629
SAM: Yeah, we all know that when rich people get
rich, they stop. They're like, "I'm good!" and

2086
02:46:49,629 --> 02:46:52,086
they just are good people from then on.

2087
02:46:52,086 --> 02:47:00,076
BRIAN: I have reached the number I told myself at
five would satiate me, and yeah. Our next question

2088
02:47:00,076 --> 02:47:12,007
comes from JornCener. So close to John Cena.
"Matt: What was the plan for Hotis, assuming Vox

2089
02:47:12,007 --> 02:47:17,571
"Machina--" Hotis was the pit fiend. I don't need to
remind you. I should remind the audience.

2090
02:47:17,571 --> 02:47:20,339
MATT: The rakshasa.

2091
02:47:20,339 --> 02:47:24,561
BRIAN: I'm like, "Matt, if you don't remember."
Let me Mattsplain something to you.

2092
02:47:24,561 --> 02:47:25,807
MATT: Incorrectly.

2093
02:47:25,807 --> 02:47:27,285
BRAIN: Wait, wasn't Hotis the--

2094
02:47:27,285 --> 02:47:28,438
LAURA: The rakshasa.

2095
02:47:28,438 --> 02:47:30,996
BRIAN: Goddamn it! Wait! What was the pit fiend's
name?

2096
02:47:30,996 --> 02:47:32,486
MATT: Utugash!

2097
02:47:32,486 --> 02:47:41,171
BRIAN: Utugash. I'll turn in my notice, "Matt:
What was the plan for Hotis," the rakshasa,

2098
02:47:41,171 --> 02:47:45,061
"assuming VM hadn't ended him? Would have have
shown up in the final arc, or would he have been

2099
02:47:45,061 --> 02:47:48,726
left as a lingering threat for the next
campaign?"

2100
02:47:48,726 --> 02:47:53,072
MATT: He wouldn't have been a lingering threat for
the next campaign. The rakshasa's bent on

2101
02:47:53,072 --> 02:47:56,622
vengeance towards the one that killed him.
Otherwise, it goes about their own business, their

2102
02:47:56,622 --> 02:48:04,773
own plans and plots. So Hotis would have
eventually acknowledged at the end. By the time

2103
02:48:04,773 --> 02:48:10,458
Hotis would've come back, the campaign would've
been over. So it would have been a post-credits

2104
02:48:10,458 --> 02:48:16,656
scene, if you will, where his vengeance against
Vax cannot be acquired because he's no longer

2105
02:48:16,656 --> 02:48:23,293
around. It would instead turn towards Ashley,
towards Pike.

2106
02:48:23,293 --> 02:48:25,166
TRAVS: (as Grog) No, you can't!

2107
02:48:25,166 --> 02:48:28,583
LAURA: Good thing she's so powerful. She would've
taken him down. No problem.

2108
02:48:28,583 --> 02:48:30,364
MARISHA: We're bosses by that point.

2109
02:48:30,364 --> 02:48:35,601
MATT: Hotis, at this point, knows what he's up
against, and would not just go up against you by

2110
02:48:35,601 --> 02:48:40,263
himself. A rakshasa, upon realizing what you can
do, especially if you killed him once or twice, is

2111
02:48:40,263 --> 02:48:49,531
going to instead go after the people you care
about. I'm glad it worked out the way it is, it

2112
02:48:49,531 --> 02:48:53,590
made for a better end point. That would have been
a recurring nightmare for Pike until she dealt

2113
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:55,708
with it once and for all as was.

2114
02:48:55,708 --> 02:48:58,480
LIAM: Follow-up question. Did Tova live?

2115
02:48:58,480 --> 02:49:00,326
MATT: You've already asked this question.

2116
02:49:00,326 --> 02:49:03,333
LIAM: But it was in a bear context.

2117
02:49:03,333 --> 02:49:05,210
MATT: It was in a bear context. Yeah, Tova lived.

2118
02:49:05,210 --> 02:49:08,824
BRIAN: Honey Heist is canon. We already
established that.

2119
02:49:08,824 --> 02:49:13,929
MATT: Tova did live. The only reason Tova survived is
because of the ring of invisibility. It was just

2120
02:49:13,929 --> 02:49:23,258
enough of a tool to enable her to get around the
smaller dangers and avoid the bigger ones that

2121
02:49:23,258 --> 02:49:27,809
could see through invisibility and find a way out.
Unfortunately, she didn't recover any of her

2122
02:49:27,809 --> 02:49:29,762
allies, but she survived.

2123
02:49:29,762 --> 02:49:35,115
BRIAN: Sam, question for you from
Hakumen_narukami. "You mentioned before that Tary

2124
02:49:35,115 --> 02:49:40,594
"was only meant to stay for a couple of sessions.
When was Scanlan meant to come back before the one

2125
02:49:40,594 --> 02:49:41,870
"year break?"

2126
02:49:41,870 --> 02:49:49,734
SAM: No idea. I assumed it would be a two or three
episode dalliance and that everyone would grow

2127
02:49:49,734 --> 02:49:59,511
tired of Taryon and he would die. Probably. He was
pretty weak. Then I'd have to figure out a way to

2128
02:49:59,511 --> 02:50:06,013
get Scanlan back. But turns out Taryon was so
dashingly charming that everyone fell in love with

2129
02:50:06,013 --> 02:50:09,064
him instantly!

2130
02:50:09,064 --> 02:50:13,537
LIAM: Those three episodes was how long it took
for us to chill the hell out.

2131
02:50:13,537 --> 02:50:23,604
SAM: There was no finite plan for how to bring
Scanlan back, right? He went to go do his thing.

2132
02:50:23,604 --> 02:50:26,487
MATT: I wasn't sure how long you wanted that to
be. We had just discussed his--

2133
02:50:26,487 --> 02:50:33,812
SAM: We discussed his goals. So when he went back
to Ank'Harel, he went for revenge. Matt explained

2134
02:50:33,812 --> 02:50:42,012
to me that he didn't just get revenge right away.
He had to lie in wait for those two guys who

2135
02:50:42,012 --> 02:50:49,450
wronged him to come back into town eventually.
Plot and figure out a way to destroy them in some

2136
02:50:49,450 --> 02:50:59,687
way. So he took their counterfeiter away from them
and ruined their business. Shamed them. Created

2137
02:50:59,687 --> 02:51:06,036
this Meat Man character to shame them and
intimidate them in front of all the underworld and

2138
02:51:06,036 --> 02:51:09,540
chased them out of town forever. We had to roll
for all this stuff, too.

2139
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:13,811
MATT: Yeah, we did a whole series of rolls to see
about successes and failures. By the end, you had

2140
02:51:13,811 --> 02:51:21,082
their counterfeiter, you knew their underground,
and there was a power vacuum in this small scale

2141
02:51:21,082 --> 02:51:22,661
of what business they were running.

2142
02:51:22,661 --> 02:51:25,061
SAM: I had been sitting there waiting for them for
months and months.

2143
02:51:25,061 --> 02:51:26,859
MATT: I asked you what you wanted to do, and you
said:

2144
02:51:26,859 --> 02:51:28,890
SAM: I guess I'll just stay.

2145
02:51:28,890 --> 02:51:32,533
MATT: "I'll invite Kaylie and the two of us will
take over the business." That's where that

2146
02:51:32,533 --> 02:51:35,460
happened. It naturally went that direction.

2147
02:51:35,460 --> 02:51:37,259
SAM: It was a fun year.

2148
02:51:37,259 --> 02:51:39,651
MARISHA: What kind of a counterfeiter? Like a
money counterfeiter?

2149
02:51:39,651 --> 02:51:44,066
SAM: Furniture. Art pieces. Antiques.

2150
02:51:44,066 --> 02:51:48,721
MATT: Expensive antique furniture. Things that
you'd sell to the upper lordship.

2151
02:51:48,721 --> 02:51:50,812
MARISHA: That's right, I do recall that. Yeah.

2152
02:51:50,812 --> 02:51:52,220
SAM: Fine art pieces.

2153
02:51:52,220 --> 02:51:54,063
MARISHA: Yeah, that's crazy.

2154
02:51:54,063 --> 02:51:55,630
TALIESIN: Peter O'Toole.

2155
02:51:55,630 --> 02:51:57,281
BRIAN: Peter O'Toole?

2156
02:51:57,281 --> 02:52:00,200
TALIESIN: That's what I think of when I think of
high-class counterfeit art.

2157
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:05,480
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

2158
02:52:05,480 --> 02:52:11,284
BRIAN: Matt. Save us from Taliesin with an answer
to this question from ForsakenGrundle. "Is there

2159
02:52:11,284 --> 02:52:13,721
"anything the soulstones from Dis could have been
used for?"

2160
02:52:13,721 --> 02:52:22,628
MATT: The soulstones from Dis? Other than the
quick high and perhaps the ingestion of one right

2161
02:52:22,628 --> 02:52:30,377
before battle giving a temporary advantage to
initiative, maybe. Not really. They're not

2162
02:52:30,377 --> 02:52:38,296
designed as sustenance for human beings. The
benefits are generally gained by devils and

2163
02:52:38,296 --> 02:52:42,895
entities that can subsist and gain power from
souls. It's a whole different ball game. But for

2164
02:52:42,895 --> 02:52:48,148
these chuckleheads in Dis it basically meant you
got a brief headrush and realized you devoured

2165
02:52:48,148 --> 02:52:50,318
something once living.

2166
02:52:50,318 --> 02:52:52,113
LAURA: I still have one in my inventory.

2167
02:52:52,113 --> 02:52:55,062
MATT: For one of those special nights.

2168
02:52:55,062 --> 02:52:56,064
LAURA: Yeah.

2169
02:52:56,064 --> 02:53:00,862
TALIESIN: What would happen if a tiefling ate one?
Would that change things?

2170
02:53:00,862 --> 02:53:04,428
MATT: Might be a stronger brief headrush.

2171
02:53:04,428 --> 02:53:05,734
TALIESIN: Curious.

2172
02:53:05,734 --> 02:53:11,194
BRIAN: Taliesin. Jacob Thomas Bush wants to know,
"There was a moment after Percy used the Scrying

2173
02:53:11,194 --> 02:53:15,051
"Eye that felt like he wanted to kill Scanlan, but
Vex talked him out of it. If she didn't intervene,

2174
02:53:15,051 --> 02:53:16,629
"what would've happened?"

2175
02:53:16,629 --> 02:53:23,482
TALIESIN: I'm happy to answer. He wouldn't have
killed him. He was going to find him. Again, under

2176
02:53:23,482 --> 02:53:28,908
the rules of this world, I understand how this
works. Sneak in, cripple him, take all of his

2177
02:53:28,908 --> 02:53:35,521
stuff and tell him never to come back again. I was
not happy with him having a vestige. I knew that

2178
02:53:35,521 --> 02:53:39,860
he had taken shit from the house and I wanted to
send a message that we were not happy. I didn't

2179
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:43,928
feel that he was responsible enough to have a lot
of the stuff he had. I would've just snuck in,

2180
02:53:43,928 --> 02:53:48,425
kneecapped him, taken his stuff, and say, "Don't
come back."

2181
02:53:48,425 --> 02:53:49,685
TRAVIS: Use your words.

2182
02:53:49,685 --> 02:53:53,075
TALIESIN: That would've been the end! I was
ready.

2183
02:53:53,075 --> 02:53:57,166
BRIAN: So what you're saying is, you didn't really
have much of a plan in mind.

2184
02:53:57,166 --> 02:53:59,316
TALIESIN: I didn't have any plan in mind.

2185
02:53:59,316 --> 02:54:01,768
LIAM: Neutral good, folks, neutral good.

2186
02:54:01,768 --> 02:54:07,387
BRIAN: Travis, save yourself from your own
crippling boredom with an answer to this question

2187
02:54:07,387 --> 02:54:14,964
from Melzy89. "Grog has come close to finding lady
love (or at least infatuation) on a number of

2188
02:54:14,964 --> 02:54:19,951
"occasions. Do you consider any of the women Grog
encountered 'the one that got away'?"

2189
02:54:19,951 --> 02:54:21,422
TRAVIS: No.

2190
02:54:21,422 --> 02:54:22,814
SAM and LIAM: Follow up!

2191
02:54:22,814 --> 02:54:24,201
BRIAN: Please!

2192
02:54:24,201 --> 02:54:26,519
SAM: Did you boink the nymph?!

2193
02:54:26,519 --> 02:54:30,869
ALL: (chanting) Nymph!

2194
02:54:30,869 --> 02:54:34,782
TRAVIS: So the only people in the room that know
the answer to this is Matt and I and the answer

2195
02:54:34,782 --> 02:54:36,430
is: No.

2196
02:54:36,430 --> 02:54:38,026
(gasping)

2197
02:54:38,026 --> 02:54:45,861
TRAVIS: I didn't, no! She was very genuine in the
conversation we had. Grog was super meek when

2198
02:54:45,861 --> 02:54:49,574
confronted with this super hot naked nymph creature.

2199
02:54:49,574 --> 02:54:56,642
MATT: It was suggestive, a little bit. I remember
she pushed you onto this slab and straddled you.

2200
02:54:56,642 --> 02:54:58,911
And you were like, "What's going on?!"

2201
02:54:58,911 --> 02:55:01,930
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll call that "suggestive."

2202
02:55:01,930 --> 02:55:06,561
MATT: It was her bequeathing the heart to him.

2203
02:55:06,561 --> 02:55:10,084
LAURA: Yeah, that's what you do. You straddle
somebody when you give them your heart.

2204
02:55:10,084 --> 02:55:15,590
MATT: It was ceremonial from her perspective, but
it was also trying to make Travis uncomfortable.

2205
02:55:15,590 --> 02:55:18,977
As I'm describing this to him in his kitchen.

2206
02:55:18,977 --> 02:55:26,267
TRAVIS: He has gentle tendencies underneath! I
think he just wanted to let you guys wonder for

2207
02:55:26,267 --> 02:55:27,418
five years.

2208
02:55:27,418 --> 02:55:28,935
MATT: Yeah. Nothing happened.

2209
02:55:28,935 --> 02:55:30,319
LIAM: Grog did or Travis did?

2210
02:55:30,319 --> 02:55:31,690
TRAVIS: What's the difference?

2211
02:55:31,690 --> 02:55:37,162
BRIAN: Question for anyone that this might be
applicable to from TiamatZX. "Were there any other

2212
02:55:37,162 --> 02:55:45,319
"small things that the group did together on their
year off that have not yet been revealed?" Did

2213
02:55:45,319 --> 02:55:47,074
everything pretty much come out?

2214
02:55:47,074 --> 02:55:50,045
TRAVIS: I think it came out during previous Talks
and the show.

2215
02:55:50,045 --> 02:55:54,140
TALIESIN: The only thing was the eloping and that
eventually came out.

2216
02:55:54,140 --> 02:56:00,332
LAURA: We didn't talk about how we broke up. We
broke up and then got back together and then we

2217
02:56:00,332 --> 02:56:01,430
got married.

2218
02:56:01,430 --> 02:56:02,627
BRIAN: You're that couple?

2219
02:56:02,627 --> 02:56:03,716
LAURA: Yeah.

2220
02:56:03,716 --> 02:56:05,074
LIAM: How was the wedding?

2221
02:56:05,074 --> 02:56:06,276
LAURA: It was very private.

2222
02:56:06,276 --> 02:56:07,373
TALIESIN: It was quiet and personal.

2223
02:56:07,373 --> 02:56:08,567
LAURA: Trinket was there.

2224
02:56:08,567 --> 02:56:09,412
LIAM: Where was it?

2225
02:56:09,412 --> 02:56:10,599
LAURA: It was in front of the Sun Tree.

2226
02:56:10,599 --> 02:56:11,726
TALIESIN: This is right.

2227
02:56:11,726 --> 02:56:12,672
MARISHA: Was it really?

2228
02:56:12,672 --> 02:56:13,882
SAM: Were there any witnesses?

2229
02:56:13,882 --> 02:56:15,339
TRAVIS: I was there because I'm super important.

2230
02:56:15,339 --> 02:56:20,456
(laughter)

2231
02:56:20,456 --> 02:56:27,421
BRIAN: Matt, DerAlpi wants to know, "What were the
consequences of being caught listening to theatre

2232
02:56:27,421 --> 02:56:28,853
"in the Feywild?"

2233
02:56:28,853 --> 02:56:36,815
MATT: Ah, okay. If you are found to be listening
to the theatre and you are not a member of the

2234
02:56:36,815 --> 02:56:43,482
theatre, they converge on you and make you a
member.

2235
02:56:43,482 --> 02:56:45,073
LAURA: They kill you.

2236
02:56:45,073 --> 02:56:49,753
MATT: They pull your soul to join the theatre.
Which means you either have to flee or fail to

2237
02:56:49,753 --> 02:56:54,038
flee and become a member of the theatre. Begin as
an audience member and the longer you're there,

2238
02:56:54,038 --> 02:56:58,512
eventually you're pulled into one of the various
performances or troupes that cycle through there.

2239
02:56:58,512 --> 02:57:00,354
BRIAN: The Phantom of Vox Machina.

2240
02:57:00,354 --> 02:57:02,111
LAURA: So everybody that was there got caught.

2241
02:57:02,111 --> 02:57:05,906
MATT: Got caught or was a spirit that eventually
wandered into the theatre and found a home there.

2242
02:57:05,906 --> 02:57:08,480
MARISHA: Exactly like getting Taft Hartley-ed is
what you're saying.

2243
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:12,822
MATT: Essentially, yeah. You must join after your
third show.

2244
02:57:12,822 --> 02:57:23,591
BRIAN: Speaking of everyone's third favorite
couple. "Laura &amp; Taliesin," @T_fallenangel_T wants

2245
02:57:23,591 --> 02:57:29,490
to know, "can you share with us the marriage
proposal (who asked who &amp; how), why did you not

2246
02:57:29,490 --> 02:57:33,813
"tell Vox Machina, who married you (was it Pike?),
and did Tary know?"

2247
02:57:33,813 --> 02:57:39,609
LAURA: Oh, how did we say this happened? I think
it was we were out on a walk and then we were

2248
02:57:39,609 --> 02:57:41,810
talking about marriage.

2249
02:57:41,810 --> 02:57:48,718
TALIESIN: The whole notion was very punk rock from
the top to the bottom. I think it was also a "God,

2250
02:57:48,718 --> 02:57:54,200
"I do not want to be a couple like your brother."
Was a big part of it. Let's not be your brother

2251
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:55,876
and Keyleth at all.

2252
02:57:55,876 --> 02:57:58,533
LAURA: Let's just do it. Let's just go for it.
Yeah.

2253
02:57:58,533 --> 02:58:04,229
TALIESIN: I thought it was a good reflection of
"life is complicated and we could die at any

2254
02:58:04,229 --> 02:58:05,337
"moment."

2255
02:58:05,337 --> 02:58:11,976
LAURA: It was very spur of the moment. It's not like 
there was a proposal and then we had a whole thing. It was

2256
02:58:11,976 --> 02:58:14,712
like, "Should we do this? Let's fucking do this."
And then we did it.

2257
02:58:14,712 --> 02:58:16,451
BRIAN: Who performed the ceremony?

2258
02:58:16,451 --> 02:58:17,851
MATT: The Tal'Dorei Vegas wedding.

2259
02:58:17,851 --> 02:58:21,572
LAURA: Did we say you asked as a joke, or I asked
you as a joke and the other said yes?

2260
02:58:21,572 --> 02:58:25,028
TALIESIN: Yes. It was like I double-dog dare you
and--

2261
02:58:25,028 --> 02:58:26,667
LAURA: We should probably get married, then, huh?

2262
02:58:26,667 --> 02:58:28,101
TALIESIN: It's just doing it then, huh?

2263
02:58:28,101 --> 02:58:29,286
LAURA: Yeah.

2264
02:58:29,286 --> 02:58:30,694
BRIAN: Who performed the ceremony?

2265
02:58:30,694 --> 02:58:33,536
TALIESIN: Was it the priest from, I'm trying to
remember.

2266
02:58:33,536 --> 02:58:34,732
LIAM: Taliesin Jaffe.

2267
02:58:34,732 --> 02:58:36,978
TALIESIN: I marry everybody, to be fair.

2268
02:58:36,978 --> 02:58:40,381
BRIAN: Did Tary know? Was the last question.

2269
02:58:40,381 --> 02:58:47,572
LAURA: No, Tary knew before anybody else did,
though because he was in the house.

2270
02:58:47,572 --> 02:58:49,134
BRIAN: He was there? Okay.

2271
02:58:49,134 --> 02:58:50,250
LIAM: Oof.

2272
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:52,656
LAURA: Yeah. Sorry, bro.

2273
02:58:52,656 --> 02:59:00,829
LIAM: Probably one of the biggest heartbreaks of
the entire campaign. Massive. If circumstances had

2274
02:59:00,829 --> 02:59:06,263
been anything other than they were, he would not
have known what to do with himself. There was just

2275
02:59:06,263 --> 02:59:08,185
too much going on. Massive heartbreak.

2276
02:59:08,185 --> 02:59:10,128
LAURA: You were going to get told.

2277
02:59:10,128 --> 02:59:17,732
SAM: Doesn't it warm your heart to know that Tary
knew and could give her the support she needed?

2278
02:59:17,732 --> 02:59:21,435
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

2279
02:59:21,435 --> 02:59:24,523
LAURA: Yeah, everybody's going to hate me now.

2280
02:59:24,523 --> 02:59:32,309
BRIAN: Now? Sam, @snickerdoodle65 asks, "Was
Scanlan close enough to hear Pike with the earring

2281
02:59:32,309 --> 02:59:34,050
"whenever she tried to talk to him?"

2282
02:59:34,050 --> 02:59:36,370
SAM: She was always in Whitestone, right?

2283
02:59:36,370 --> 02:59:37,790
MATT: I think you were too far out of range.

2284
02:59:37,790 --> 02:59:43,233
SAM: I got out of there fast. Well, I spent some
time in the--

2285
02:59:43,233 --> 02:59:45,430
MATT: You spent some time in the Turst Fields, but
even that was too far. The range on the earrings

2286
02:59:45,430 --> 02:59:47,476
is like 1000 feet.

2287
02:59:47,476 --> 02:59:56,795
SAM: Yeah. So no, never heard Pike. But Scanlan
did do a fair amount of praying to Sarenrae while

2288
02:59:56,795 --> 02:59:59,747
he was on his Aramente.

2289
02:59:59,747 --> 03:00:10,869
BRIAN: That's hilarious. Matt, this is a really
interesting question from @HeidiDobson2. "After

2290
03:00:10,869 --> 03:00:14,793
"the year break, it was said that no one found
Scanlan when they searched for him. How many

2291
03:00:14,793 --> 03:00:17,909
"actually found him, but had Modify Memory cast on
them?"

2292
03:00:17,909 --> 03:00:27,531
MATT: None. He didn't want to be found, and there
were a few attempts. I asked you guys this when we

2293
03:00:27,531 --> 03:00:31,485
were over the break, and everyone said, "Nope. If
he wants to do his thing, let him do his thing."

2294
03:00:31,485 --> 03:00:32,835
LAURA: Not everybody. Ashley really tried.

2295
03:00:32,835 --> 03:00:33,785
SAM: Yeah.

2296
03:00:33,785 --> 03:00:35,096
MATT: That's right. Ashley really tried.

2297
03:00:35,096 --> 03:00:36,051
TRAVIS: And I really tried.

2298
03:00:36,051 --> 03:00:40,479
MATT: The two of you went to try and find him. You're
right; thank you for correcting me on that. The

2299
03:00:40,479 --> 03:00:45,240
two of you, unfortunately, didn't know where to
go, didn't know what to look for.

2300
03:00:45,240 --> 03:00:47,517
TRAVIS: I don't know why, we're a bunch of big
brains.

2301
03:00:47,517 --> 03:00:54,892
MATT: You'd expected him to still be nearby or on
Tal'Dorei. You asked in Emon, you asked in

2302
03:00:54,892 --> 03:00:59,751
Westruun. You looked around for any sort of sign,
but he was in Marquet the whole time so there was

2303
03:00:59,751 --> 03:01:00,881
no chance of finding him.

2304
03:01:00,881 --> 03:01:01,762
TRAVIS: What a dick.

2305
03:01:01,762 --> 03:01:02,803
TALIESIN: I tried to tail him briefly.

2306
03:01:02,803 --> 03:01:03,815
MATT: You did.

2307
03:01:03,815 --> 03:01:05,319
SAM: He was doing awesome stuff.

2308
03:01:05,319 --> 03:01:10,684
LAURA: Making fucking forfeit counterfeit
furniture!

2309
03:01:10,684 --> 03:01:12,535
SAM: He was making money!

2310
03:01:12,535 --> 03:01:15,764
LIAM: He was reconnecting with his daughter. No?

2311
03:01:15,764 --> 03:01:17,942
SAM: Sure, that was part of it.

2312
03:01:17,942 --> 03:01:21,222
TALIESIN: Did Scanlan ever shoot the gun?

2313
03:01:21,222 --> 03:01:23,323
SAM: He shot the gun once.

2314
03:01:23,323 --> 03:01:24,813
TALIESIN: That was the only time?

2315
03:01:24,813 --> 03:01:25,676
SAM: Yeah.

2316
03:01:25,676 --> 03:01:26,732
TALIESIN: He just had it.

2317
03:01:26,732 --> 03:01:28,690
MARISHA: I don't think you gave him any bullets.

2318
03:01:28,690 --> 03:01:29,715
SAM: I had 15 bullets.

2319
03:01:29,715 --> 03:01:32,981
TALIESIN: He had 15. Oh, then technically shot,
but not bullets. You had 15.

2320
03:01:32,981 --> 03:01:37,174
SAM: He never had cause to shoot the gun.

2321
03:01:37,174 --> 03:01:40,778
TALIESIN: Did you just pose in the mirror with it
and try to look cool with a towel like a cape?

2322
03:01:40,778 --> 03:01:46,738
BRIAN: Commissioned paintings with him holding it
in different poses hanging up over the fireplace.

2323
03:01:46,738 --> 03:01:48,657
LAURA: As a gnome, wouldn't it have been a
two-handed weapon for him?

2324
03:01:48,657 --> 03:01:50,765
TALIESIN: Ooh.

2325
03:01:50,765 --> 03:01:52,765
BRIAN: He has another one of those, doesn't he?

2326
03:01:52,765 --> 03:01:54,812
LIAM: Shoulder-mounted.

2327
03:01:54,812 --> 03:02:03,306
BRIAN: Liam, TalaTag has a question for you. "What
would Vax's reaction have been had he found out

2328
03:02:03,306 --> 03:02:09,605
"about Vex and Percy's wedding before everything went
down with Vecna and the Raven Queen deal, after

2329
03:02:09,605 --> 03:02:13,471
"Vex herself had specifically told him not to get
married in secret?"

2330
03:02:13,471 --> 03:02:14,870
LIAM: Wait, go through it again. You lost me.

2331
03:02:14,870 --> 03:02:21,327
BRIAN: "What would Vax's reaction have been had he
found out about Vex and Percy's wedding before

2332
03:02:21,327 --> 03:02:25,865
"everything went down with Vecna and the Raven
Queen deal, after Vex herself had specifically

2333
03:02:25,865 --> 03:02:31,182
"told him not to get married in secret?" Basically,
telling you not to do the exact thing that she

2334
03:02:31,182 --> 03:02:32,039
ended up doing.

2335
03:02:32,039 --> 03:02:33,255
LAURA: I don't even remember telling you not to
get married.

2336
03:02:33,255 --> 03:02:38,320
LIAM: I super hardcore remember it. Hardcore
remember it.

2337
03:02:38,320 --> 03:02:40,438
MARISHA: So we're back to the wedding.

2338
03:02:40,438 --> 03:02:45,513
BRIAN: Do you think he would have said, "You
hypocrite," or it would have been "I understand

2339
03:02:45,513 --> 03:02:47,678
"why you had to do this."

2340
03:02:47,678 --> 03:02:51,914
LIAM: He would've done neither of those. He just
would have asked why.

2341
03:02:51,914 --> 03:02:55,786
BRIAN: Seems very Vax of him to do.

2342
03:02:55,786 --> 03:02:59,049
MARISHA: It all hit at a really inopportune time.

2343
03:02:59,049 --> 03:03:01,391
LAURA: It was a bad time for all of it to come
out.

2344
03:03:01,391 --> 03:03:07,560
MARISHA: If anything, it's kind of what you said
about you guys not wanting to be like your brother

2345
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:17,018
and Keyleth. I mean, it kind of paid off in the
end. It ultimately is a good lesson. Fuck it,

2346
03:03:17,018 --> 03:03:24,064
don't wait! If you love somebody, don't wait! Go
marry them! Tell them! You never know what could

2347
03:03:24,064 --> 03:03:25,922
happen! Let them know!

2348
03:03:25,922 --> 03:03:28,657
MATT: After a responsible period of time.

2349
03:03:28,657 --> 03:03:32,376
MARISHA: Yeah, don't be like creepy about it.

2350
03:03:32,376 --> 03:03:34,551
SAM: The first time you think you want to marry
someone, you should definitely marry them.

2351
03:03:34,551 --> 03:03:41,418
LIAM: It would have been different, even though
Laura doesn't remember it, if she had not so

2352
03:03:41,418 --> 03:03:49,009
specifically said, "Don't go off to Zephrah and
get married without me there." I know! But I do!

2353
03:03:49,009 --> 03:03:52,520
And factored it into all of my thinking. What am I
supposed to do?

2354
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:59,470
BRIAN: Those statements happen so often; it's hard
to keep track! Marisha, Futureshocking wants to

2355
03:03:59,470 --> 03:04:03,903
know, "At the temple of Melora, after burying
Senokir's wife's ashes, it seemed like they really

2356
03:04:03,903 --> 03:04:10,021
"wanted their Spire of Conflux back. Given that at
the time the Chroma Conclave was defeated, did

2357
03:04:10,021 --> 03:04:12,285
"Keyleth ever consider handing it over?"

2358
03:04:12,285 --> 03:04:20,113
MARISHA: You know, I thought about it, but nah. We
worked really hard for that.

2359
03:04:20,113 --> 03:04:21,329
LIAM: Loot drop!

2360
03:04:21,329 --> 03:04:27,281
MARISHA: It's mine. It would be better used in my
hands, ruling my people, than in a museum

2361
03:04:27,281 --> 03:04:28,796
somewhere.

2362
03:04:28,796 --> 03:04:30,394
TALIESIN: It tied the outfit together.

2363
03:04:30,394 --> 03:04:31,930
LAURA: It really did. It looked so good.

2364
03:04:31,930 --> 03:04:40,300
MARISHA: I know! Anyway, I did think about after
the arc had ended and we were talking about what

2365
03:04:40,300 --> 03:04:44,063
we were going to if I was going to go back to
Melora's temple and give the staff back. Then I

2366
03:04:44,063 --> 03:04:50,768
was like, "Nah, I just like it too much." Really
pulls the whole Voice of the Tempest thing

2367
03:04:50,768 --> 03:04:52,007
together.

2368
03:04:52,007 --> 03:04:58,233
BRIAN: It makes the art even better. Ashley,
question from Legotti. "Would you have wanted to

2369
03:04:58,233 --> 03:05:03,320
"play an evil Pike had her family's tales of the
curse been true? What were you expecting through

2370
03:05:03,320 --> 03:05:05,262
"this bit of story?"

2371
03:05:05,262 --> 03:05:16,672
ASHLEY: That would have been very fun. That goes
back to all of us giving Matt a little kernel of

2372
03:05:16,672 --> 03:05:24,797
something and him taking it with his amazing
storytelling. I just knew that my family was going

2373
03:05:24,797 --> 03:05:32,953
to be tricksters and thieves and that whole thing,
hence the last name. I didn't know any of that was

2374
03:05:32,953 --> 03:05:39,465
going to happen, obviously, but I would have gone
with it if it would have happened. That would have

2375
03:05:39,465 --> 03:05:41,267
been fun, to see an evil Pike.

2376
03:05:41,267 --> 03:05:46,831
MARISHA: It's kind of crazy, because at that point
in time it seemed like all of the ghost stories

2377
03:05:46,831 --> 03:05:51,964
that we had been dealing with <i>were</i> real, and
then hers-- yours wasn't.

2378
03:05:51,964 --> 03:05:53,698
TALIESIN: Scooby-Dooed, so hard.

2379
03:05:53,698 --> 03:05:55,122
LAURA: Yeah, we were Scooby-Dooed.

2380
03:05:55,122 --> 03:05:57,111
ASHLEY: We were <i>very</i> Scooby-Dooed.

2381
03:05:57,111 --> 03:06:05,047
BRIAN: Ash, how does it feel to be on a pedestal?
Right where you belong? That was a question from

2382
03:06:05,047 --> 03:06:12,669
@BrianWFoster. Our last two questions for this
are, Matt, first up for you, @AlwayzB_. But they

2383
03:06:12,669 --> 03:06:17,881
don't say what to always be, I don't know what to
always be! Always be closing? "If Sam hadn't

2384
03:06:17,881 --> 03:06:25,093
"rolled so well, using his fate die no less, to
convince Lord Darrington to back down, how did you

2385
03:06:25,093 --> 03:06:26,439
"see things going?"

2386
03:06:26,439 --> 03:06:31,967
MATT: Not well for the Darrington family. The way
it had gone back and forth leading up to that

2387
03:06:31,967 --> 03:06:35,141
final roll, if he had rolled poorly and didn't
have that die roll or that die roll rolled poorly,

2388
03:06:35,141 --> 03:06:45,765
that would have been the end of the family unit.
It would have been an unfixable divide between him

2389
03:06:45,765 --> 03:06:52,366
and his father. He would have been probably cast
out of the house indefinitely. His mother would

2390
03:06:52,366 --> 03:06:55,399
have had to choose between. It would have just
sundered the whole family.

2391
03:06:55,399 --> 03:06:57,012
SAM: I'm a loner, Doty.

2392
03:06:57,012 --> 03:07:05,684
MATT: It would have made for a very different and
a very interesting story arc for Taryon at that

2393
03:07:05,684 --> 03:07:10,014
point, and then the-- honestly, that might have
been more of an opportunity for him to stay with

2394
03:07:10,014 --> 03:07:12,340
Vox Machina if he wanted to.

2395
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:14,677
SAM: There's still a chance, guys, to take him
back!

2396
03:07:14,677 --> 03:07:19,689
MATT: Yeah, for a little while longer, at the
very least, because he didn't have a family to try

2397
03:07:19,689 --> 03:07:24,740
and help right the story for. I was really worried
for him. I had forgotten about the fate die at

2398
03:07:24,740 --> 03:07:29,078
that point, and when you rolled so poorly I was
like, "Shit, there it is." And then you had just

2399
03:07:29,078 --> 03:07:35,112
won the Battle Royale and got that die and I was
like, "Well that-- if you can't--" You can't call

2400
03:07:35,112 --> 03:07:38,352
it a fate die more than that fucking moment! That
was ridiculous.

2401
03:07:38,352 --> 03:07:42,308
LAURA: Can I ask you a question that does have
nothing to do with that but the fate die kind of

2402
03:07:42,308 --> 03:07:43,268
reminded me of it?

2403
03:07:43,268 --> 03:07:44,275
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2404
03:07:44,275 --> 03:07:49,164
LAURA: Did you have plans for the hag cashing in
the favor? From Vax?

2405
03:07:49,164 --> 03:07:55,391
MATT: I did, but by the time it had come around to
where I was planning to maybe pull it in, other

2406
03:07:55,391 --> 03:07:58,518
story threads were prominent in the front and it
just would have made things messy.

2407
03:07:58,518 --> 03:07:59,898
TRAVIS: His life was already fucked.

2408
03:07:59,898 --> 03:08:08,285
MATT: Yeah, the way things had gone-- a hag who
liked to play with fate and toy with the soul of

2409
03:08:08,285 --> 03:08:12,585
another, but when that soul already belongs to the
goddess who is the goddess of fate and the

2410
03:08:12,585 --> 03:08:15,910
transition of death, the hag can sense that and be
like, "Nah, I'm good."

2411
03:08:15,910 --> 03:08:18,681
SAM: She doesn't want her 75 gold?

2412
03:08:18,681 --> 03:08:25,891
MATT: Yeah, no. At that point it was like, "Okay,
I invested poorly, I'm going to cut my losses and run."

2413
03:08:25,891 --> 03:08:34,596
BRIAN: It's what I'm going to do after this show.
Travis, @roadrunner032 wants to know, "How long

2414
03:08:34,596 --> 03:08:39,492
"did it take for Grog to get truly angry with
Scanlan for leaving? Would he have been as angry

2415
03:08:39,492 --> 03:08:42,700
"if Lionel was not a barbarian as well?"

2416
03:08:42,700 --> 03:08:50,745
TRAVIS: No. I was not mad at-- or, Grog was not
mad at Scanlan until he came back. With the

2417
03:08:50,745 --> 03:08:57,631
illusion, and the wearing the disguise and
everything. It was instantaneous rage from Pike

2418
03:08:57,631 --> 03:09:04,380
and I. A, that he had to pretend. B, we had been
worried about him. And then C, brought this

2419
03:09:04,380 --> 03:09:13,378
jackass that was like a half-orc imitation of
Grog. An idiot, a barbarian, and Grog had the

2420
03:09:13,378 --> 03:09:20,077
biggest jealousy issue of all time. I was ready to
pick Scanlan up and just smash his brain into

2421
03:09:20,077 --> 03:09:22,507
jelly and just paint on the wall.

2422
03:09:22,507 --> 03:09:26,180
BRIAN: What would you have painted? What phrase,
or perhaps image?

2423
03:09:26,180 --> 03:09:27,639
SAM: He can't spell.

2424
03:09:27,639 --> 03:09:35,516
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know! Anything, just (noisy
crying) tears.

2425
03:09:35,516 --> 03:09:39,405
BRIAN: It would have been, "use the code
(mumbles)..." Yeah, never mind.

2426
03:09:39,405 --> 03:09:42,359
ALL: Critrole!

2427
03:09:42,359 --> 03:09:49,499
BRIAN: Use the code "Hearthstone!" Okay, our final
round of CritRoleStats for the Vox Machina

2428
03:09:49,499 --> 03:09:58,270
campaign is "most cast spell per character." I
want you to guess what your most cast spell was

2429
03:09:58,270 --> 03:10:00,229
that you did. So, Keyleth, we'll start with you.

2430
03:10:00,229 --> 03:10:02,912
MARISHA: My most cast spell?

2431
03:10:02,912 --> 03:10:07,494
BRIAN: Yeah, you cast it 43 times.

2432
03:10:07,494 --> 03:10:08,688
MARISHA: Call Lightning?

2433
03:10:08,688 --> 03:10:16,329
BRIAN: Close. Transport via Plants. Scanlan. 47
times you cast which spell?

2434
03:10:16,329 --> 03:10:17,623
SAM: Bigby's Hand?

2435
03:10:17,623 --> 03:10:18,928
BRIAN: Healing Word.

2436
03:10:18,928 --> 03:10:22,745
SAM: Oh, that's a spell! That's right! I am the
healer of the group.

2437
03:10:22,745 --> 03:10:29,039
BRIAN: Percy. 27 times you cast this.

2438
03:10:29,039 --> 03:10:34,413
TALIESIN: I already know, but I knew going in.
Hex. I only have three spells.

2439
03:10:34,413 --> 03:10:39,421
BRIAN: I know, but you still had a one in three
chance of guessing right, and you did correct.

2440
03:10:39,421 --> 03:10:42,824
Vex, 80 times you cast what?

2441
03:10:42,824 --> 03:10:46,131
LAURA: I would go Hunter's Mark, but I think it's
Pass Without a Trace.

2442
03:10:46,131 --> 03:10:50,390
BRIAN: You are incorrect. It is Hunter's Mark with
80.

2443
03:10:50,390 --> 03:10:52,245
SAM: You can't even get that Hunter's Mark right!

2444
03:10:52,245 --> 03:10:54,287
BRIAN: You couldn't even remember that!

2445
03:10:54,287 --> 03:10:56,985
LAURA: I really thought it was Pass Without a Trace!

2446
03:10:56,985 --> 03:10:59,850
BRIAN: Vax, 25 times you did what?

2447
03:10:59,850 --> 03:11:02,953
LIAM: Smite doesn't count because it's not a
spell.

2448
03:11:02,953 --> 03:11:04,463
TRAVIS: Luck.

2449
03:11:04,463 --> 03:11:06,325
BRIAN: No, Luck would have been the tens of
thousands.

2450
03:11:06,325 --> 03:11:07,521
LIAM: Bless?

2451
03:11:07,521 --> 03:11:09,219
BRIAN: Close. Lay on Hands.

2452
03:11:09,219 --> 03:11:12,720
LIAM: Lay on Hands is not really a spell. It's
like a feature.

2453
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:15,822
MATT: It's an ability. We'll let it slide.

2454
03:11:15,822 --> 03:11:20,185
BRIAN: Pike? Can you guess? 40 times you cast
what?

2455
03:11:20,185 --> 03:11:22,152
ASHLEY: Guiding Bolt up the butt?

2456
03:11:22,152 --> 03:11:26,077
SAM: That is the full name of the spell.

2457
03:11:26,077 --> 03:11:27,677
BRIAN: That is correct.

2458
03:11:27,677 --> 03:11:30,051
LAURA: From here on out, it's Guiding Bolt Up the
Butt.

2459
03:11:30,051 --> 03:11:35,021
BRIAN: Nope. Cure Wounds up the butt. Cure all the
up the butt Wounds.

2460
03:11:35,021 --> 03:11:38,484
MATT: I would hope it would be Cure Wounds, as a
cleric.

2461
03:11:38,484 --> 03:11:39,821
ASHLEY: Me too.

2462
03:11:39,821 --> 03:11:41,190
BRIAN: Grog. 18 times.

2463
03:11:41,190 --> 03:11:42,176
TRAVIS: I cast something?

2464
03:11:42,176 --> 03:11:44,999
BRIAN: You cast something via the Titanstone
Knuckles.

2465
03:11:44,999 --> 03:11:47,016
TRAVIS: Oh! Enlarge. Thank you.

2466
03:11:47,016 --> 03:11:48,654
BRIAN: As if he needed it.

2467
03:11:48,654 --> 03:11:50,015
TRAVIS: I forgot, yeah, I had a spell.

2468
03:11:50,015 --> 03:11:59,263
BRIAN: That's all the time we have! There we go!
That's all the time we have to discuss-- Jesus

2469
03:11:59,263 --> 03:12:04,424
Christ. That's all the time we have to discuss
Jesus Christ! That's all the time we have to

2470
03:12:04,424 --> 03:12:11,028
discuss the adventures of Taryon Darrington. Our
fifth and final arc dives deep into the reality

2471
03:12:11,028 --> 03:12:17,904
that with great power comes great enemies with
ramifications that shook the very foundations of

2472
03:12:17,904 --> 03:12:24,213
their world. In episodes 100 through 115, Vox
Machina made their way into perhaps the darkest

2473
03:12:24,213 --> 03:12:29,140
dungeon they would ever face, the mind of Vecna.
Coming up next.

2474
03:12:29,140 --> 03:12:35,404
[musical crescendo]

2475
03:12:35,404 --> 03:12:37,102
All right. Our questions for the

2476
03:12:37,102 --> 03:12:44,846
final arc of Vox Machina's journey begin with you,
Matt, as we always do. Question from @AlwayzB_. I

2477
03:12:44,846 --> 03:12:50,624
guess the end of that is Always Be Asking Matt
Questions! "How many other gods could Vox Machina

2478
03:12:50,690 --> 03:12:54,932
"have talked to? Related, how many trammels or
boons were possible to get?"

2479
03:12:54,932 --> 03:13:05,199
MATT: Possible? From each deity they reached out
to, they could have acquired a seed or a spark

2480
03:13:05,199 --> 03:13:09,297
that could be created into a trammel. But they
went to all the gods they knew were closest to

2481
03:13:09,297 --> 03:13:14,719
them. Those were the fast tracks to the ones that
would have the closest connection and the easiest,

2482
03:13:14,719 --> 03:13:20,544
most fine-tuned challenges to what you're able to
do. Other deities that you didn't have a strong

2483
03:13:20,544 --> 03:13:24,806
connection to, you'd have to research what they're
about, where they are, how to get there and then

2484
03:13:24,806 --> 03:13:29,770
each one of those experiences would have been a
much longer, protracted, and challenging endeavor.

2485
03:13:29,770 --> 03:13:35,886
That's more time that would have added to the
progression of Vecna's power. If you had gone to a

2486
03:13:35,886 --> 03:13:39,728
fourth deity, there probably wouldn't be a
Vasselheim standing, Vecna would have performed

2487
03:13:39,728 --> 03:13:46,959
the miracle, would have begun to understand 
abilities beyond the avatar form. If you'd gone to

2488
03:13:46,959 --> 03:13:51,601
two more trammels, the expansion of power would
have gone past the ocean into Tal'Dorei and

2489
03:13:51,601 --> 03:13:57,760
Marquet. I had a scaling element to his power
based on how many things you went for. Had you

2490
03:13:57,760 --> 03:14:01,160
gone beyond those core deities that you already
had connections with, it was going to get more

2491
03:14:01,160 --> 03:14:02,386
challenging down the road.

2492
03:14:02,386 --> 03:14:04,078
TRAVIS: We did good.

2493
03:14:04,078 --> 03:14:05,557
LAURA: It was a scaling sort of thing.

2494
03:14:05,557 --> 03:14:08,794
MATT: It was a good balance. You guys got the ones
that were close, quickly, and then went there

2495
03:14:08,794 --> 03:14:10,232
before things got too out of hand.

2496
03:14:10,232 --> 03:14:19,939
BRIAN: Sam, Nuclearwhale94 wants to know, "Why did
Scanlan choose Ank'Harel to go back to? We know he

2497
03:14:19,939 --> 03:14:25,881
"got scammed out of some gold, but why did he stay
longer than just long enough to get his revenge?"

2498
03:14:25,881 --> 03:14:31,430
SAM: As I said in the previous segment, it took
some time to get his revenge. Those guys who

2499
03:14:31,430 --> 03:14:37,944
wronged him did not live there. They were
traveling assholes. He had to sit and wait. As he

2500
03:14:37,944 --> 03:14:44,415
sat and waited, he got used to living there and
got a little taste for the power! The crime power!

2501
03:14:44,415 --> 03:14:50,057
Taste of furniture!

2502
03:14:50,057 --> 03:14:51,405
BRIAN: What's it taste like?

2503
03:14:51,405 --> 03:14:52,960
SAM: It tastes like pleather.

2504
03:14:52,960 --> 03:15:03,412
BRIAN: Ashley, question for you from Baylaust.
"Was there a specific moment when Pike's feelings

2505
03:15:03,412 --> 03:15:07,512
"for Scanlan began changing? If so, what was it
that made her reconsider?"

2506
03:15:07,512 --> 03:15:21,156
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think it-- well, I don't think, I
know. A lot of it started in the letter. Even in

2507
03:15:21,156 --> 03:15:27,444
our home games, I think the two of us would flirt
a little bit. Sorry, babe.

2508
03:15:27,444 --> 03:15:34,800
BRIAN: I don't give a shit. You think I view that
as competition? Look at this beard and then look

2509
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:36,717
at that beard, that's all I have to say.

2510
03:15:36,717 --> 03:15:44,003
LIAM: I have a <i>name.</i> How dare you.

2511
03:15:44,003 --> 03:15:46,939
TALIESIN: That was so good!

2512
03:15:46,939 --> 03:15:49,040
BRIAN: I love my life! Continue!

2513
03:15:49,040 --> 03:15:59,122
ASHLEY: She didn't take it very seriously because
she didn't think that he was very serious about

2514
03:15:59,122 --> 03:16:16,790
it. As you guys heard, that letter is very
intense. When he left, she realized how much she

2515
03:16:16,790 --> 03:16:23,152
cared for him and missed him. When he came back,
he was different and a little bit more mature and

2516
03:16:23,152 --> 03:16:34,860
she thought the time had passed. That is not so!
It was this slow climb after the letter.

2517
03:16:34,860 --> 03:16:37,980
BRIAN: I could see that having an impact.

2518
03:16:37,980 --> 03:16:42,291
SAM: Brian, when you write things, ladies like
it.

2519
03:16:42,291 --> 03:16:50,192
BRIAN: I wouldn't know, man! Not much of a words
guy, myself. Matt, question from Brooke Casey.

2520
03:16:50,192 --> 03:16:52,770
"Where did Vecna keep his phylactery?"

2521
03:16:52,770 --> 03:16:58,593
MATT: I know where. No one else is going to
fucking know that. That's not campaign

2522
03:16:58,593 --> 03:17:00,700
information; that's world lore information!

2523
03:17:00,700 --> 03:17:06,453
BRIAN: He's right behind you! Is it on the bottom?
Does it say? He's right over your shoulder. We did

2524
03:17:06,453 --> 03:17:07,627
that on purpose.

2525
03:17:07,627 --> 03:17:16,697
MATT: That miniature is his phylactery. No, you
have no idea. Brian Foster and the internet: You

2526
03:17:16,697 --> 03:17:17,737
don't know.

2527
03:17:17,737 --> 03:17:22,881
BRIAN: Laura, TiamatZX wants to know, "Did Vex
take the name de Rolo after her marriage?"

2528
03:17:22,881 --> 03:17:24,192
LAURA: Yeah.

2529
03:17:24,192 --> 03:17:30,914
BRIAN: Great. Matt, @MsMaggie357, "The Titanstone
Knuckles vibrating seemed reminiscent of

2530
03:17:30,914 --> 03:17:36,583
"Mythcarver vibrating in the slave market battle.
What were the Knuckles trying to tell Grog?"

2531
03:17:36,583 --> 03:17:42,932
MATT: A couple of things. They were resonating
because they were close to the source of which

2532
03:17:42,932 --> 03:17:47,605
they were carved. The earth titan that was raised
is what the Titanstone Knuckles were forged from.

2533
03:17:47,605 --> 03:17:59,708
The vibration when you got there was a key to that
and a possible other key to tackling the conflict

2534
03:17:59,708 --> 03:18:07,470
with Vecna. Because of the siege elements of it
and the resonation between it, the gauntlets gave

2535
03:18:07,470 --> 03:18:17,668
a bonus in structural damage against the interior
of the titan. There were other ways to slow it. If

2536
03:18:17,668 --> 03:18:24,538
you decided not to the stealth topside element,
you could also begin to damage around the legs,

2537
03:18:24,538 --> 03:18:29,809
knee structures, and cripple it from the inside.
That would have stopped the titan from moving. It

2538
03:18:29,809 --> 03:18:33,167
would have been slowly regenerating, but you would
have slowed it down or stopped it for a period of

2539
03:18:33,167 --> 03:18:37,995
time. That would have also notified all of Thar
Amphala that you were there. It would have been an

2540
03:18:37,995 --> 03:18:41,766
upward fight through the armies. There were
benefits to all the different choices you made,

2541
03:18:41,766 --> 03:18:43,715
but that was one option that you could have made.

2542
03:18:43,715 --> 03:18:46,621
TRAVIS: We didn't want to ring the dinner bell.
That was one thing, we were trying to be as

2543
03:18:46,621 --> 03:18:47,755
stealthy as possible.

2544
03:18:47,755 --> 03:18:51,159
MATT: The gauntlets were a nudge to that if you
wanted to explore that, the gauntlets could help you.

2545
03:18:51,159 --> 03:18:52,834
TRAVIS: Interesting option, though! Ooh!

2546
03:18:52,834 --> 03:18:55,320
MARISHA: That would have tapped us out by the time
we would have gotten there.

2547
03:18:55,320 --> 03:19:00,860
MATT: You could've been quick and let them bypass,
hide as they went past. There were a lot of ways

2548
03:19:00,860 --> 03:19:01,908
you could've tackled that.

2549
03:19:01,908 --> 03:19:07,086
TRAVIS: Between that and the one if I had punched
Thordak in his jewel in his chest, knowing that

2550
03:19:07,086 --> 03:19:10,159
would have shattered afterward I was like, "Oh,
I've got to explore these things better."

2551
03:19:10,159 --> 03:19:16,158
BRIAN: Those were some awesome Knuckles in the
art, too. Really beautiful.

2552
03:19:16,158 --> 03:19:18,539
MATT: They really ran with that. Made it cooler
than I ever imagined.

2553
03:19:18,539 --> 03:19:22,820
BRIAN: Looked like cooler Infinity Gauntlets.
Taliesin!

2554
03:19:22,820 --> 03:19:24,722
TALIESIN: Speaking of cooler Infinity Gauntlets.

2555
03:19:24,722 --> 03:19:32,906
BRIAN: Yeah, you're mine. Taliesin, @amun1221 wants
to know, "Was Percy troubled by the escape of Sylas?"

2556
03:19:32,906 --> 03:19:34,574
TALIESIN: No.

2557
03:19:34,574 --> 03:19:36,049
BRIAN: Why?

2558
03:19:36,049 --> 03:19:42,734
TALIESIN: He had transferred a lot of his angst
over that whole process to other people by that

2559
03:19:42,734 --> 03:19:50,503
point. I feel certain that if he comes back, we
can deal with him. We had ruined him already. He

2560
03:19:50,503 --> 03:19:55,940
had shifted his anger and frustration at the world
onto other people by that point.

2561
03:19:55,940 --> 03:20:01,351
LAURA: Sylas has a pretty shit existence at this
point. Which is nice.

2562
03:20:01,351 --> 03:20:06,259
TALIESIN: Again, it was never about Sylas on a
certain weird level.

2563
03:20:06,259 --> 03:20:08,414
LIAM: Delilah seemed like the brain.

2564
03:20:08,414 --> 03:20:09,718
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2565
03:20:09,718 --> 03:20:14,283
BRIAN: Imagine being married to that conniving of
a woman. What must that be like, I wonder?

2566
03:20:14,283 --> 03:20:15,647
TRAVIS: Why are you looking at me?

2567
03:20:15,647 --> 03:20:22,124
BRIAN: I wasn't, I was looking right past you to
our producer, Max. Matt, question from

2568
03:20:22,124 --> 03:20:29,191
@DavidMoMahoney. Could always use mo' Mahoney.
"Who was the death knight?"

2569
03:20:29,191 --> 03:20:33,425
MATT: Oh! Actually, this ties into what I answered
earlier. Remember when I mentioned that Delilah

2570
03:20:33,425 --> 03:20:38,743
had found one of Vecna's laboratories and there
was a nameless servant there that had been keeping it?

2571
03:20:38,743 --> 03:20:45,759
That was the servant. As it grew closer to Vecna's
ascension, this servant was rewarded for centuries

2572
03:20:45,759 --> 03:20:52,675
and centuries of undead vigilance, looking over
and keeping hidden these spaces in Wildemount. He

2573
03:20:52,675 --> 03:20:58,351
was elevated to death knight status and became one
of the great warriors of Vecna's return. Doesn't

2574
03:20:58,351 --> 03:21:04,265
even know his name. He's been old and held in that
space alone for so long that has no recollection

2575
03:21:04,265 --> 03:21:08,204
of the living life before and only understands its
existence at the behest of Vecna.

2576
03:21:08,204 --> 03:21:10,044
LAURA: Harold! His name was Harold.

2577
03:21:10,044 --> 03:21:15,035
TALIESIN: He's like the roommate from What We Do
In the Shadows. He's like the fourth roommate.

2578
03:21:15,035 --> 03:21:16,441
MATT: Kind of, yeah! Totally!

2579
03:21:16,441 --> 03:21:21,128
BRIAN: The one that stares in the basement
that's a little too turnt? Yeah! Liam, @Oatey_Goat

2580
03:21:21,128 --> 03:21:22,721
wants to know.

2581
03:21:22,721 --> 03:21:24,051
LIAM and LAURA: Oatey_Goat!

2582
03:21:24,051 --> 03:21:28,836
BRIAN: Oatey_Goat! "Is there anyone that you wish
you'd had time to say goodbye to before the Raven

2583
03:21:28,836 --> 03:21:30,037
"Queen took you?"

2584
03:21:30,037 --> 03:21:34,125
LIAM: Oh, that's a huge question.

2585
03:21:34,125 --> 03:21:39,162
BRIAN: That's why I saved it for when your beard
was at maximum growth.

2586
03:21:39,162 --> 03:21:52,054
LIAM: Thank you for that consideration. If he had
a week to go on a tour and see people, he would

2587
03:21:52,054 --> 03:22:03,406
have tried to make an awkward peace with his
father. He would've said goodbye to Korren at that

2588
03:22:03,406 --> 03:22:05,030
point.

2589
03:22:05,030 --> 03:22:06,941
SAM: The food, corn.

2590
03:22:06,941 --> 03:22:09,731
LIAM: The band, Korn.

2591
03:22:09,731 --> 03:22:18,498
BRIAN: He knew he would never again be able to
listen to his Korn cassettes.

2592
03:22:18,498 --> 03:22:29,587
LIAM: He listened to Elvis Costello, thank you. He
would've said goodbye to his friend, Gilmore.

2593
03:22:29,587 --> 03:22:43,543
Everything was so quick, his little sister he
barely had any moment with before he was gone. I think

2594
03:22:43,543 --> 03:22:47,375
that's it. These are the most important. Maybe I'm
forgetting somebody, but these are the most

2595
03:22:47,375 --> 03:22:53,679
important people in his life. It's his family.
100% his family. Not even like, "This is my

2596
03:22:53,679 --> 03:22:55,899
"family, this my other." This is his only family.

2597
03:22:55,899 --> 03:23:02,787
BRIAN: Damn straight. Marisha, ForsakenGrundle has
returned to us with a question.

2598
03:23:02,787 --> 03:23:05,725
MARISHA: And thank God he did.

2599
03:23:05,725 --> 03:23:07,509
SAM: Or she.

2600
03:23:07,509 --> 03:23:15,997
BRIAN: Or they! I know, there's no image attached
for me to see how blessed of a person this must

2601
03:23:15,997 --> 03:23:21,343
be. "Do you feel Keyleth was ready to lead her
people by the end of the campaign?"

2602
03:23:21,343 --> 03:23:29,805
MARISHA: Yeah! I think it still would have been a
learning process getting into it, but I think she

2603
03:23:29,805 --> 03:23:36,587
had made peace that she was ready to do that and
retire from adventuring because she was pretty

2604
03:23:36,587 --> 03:23:41,907
exhausted by the end of that. She was pretty done.
Ready to move onto the next chapter in her life.

2605
03:23:41,907 --> 03:23:45,483
BRIAN: Heavy is the head who wears the antlers.

2606
03:23:45,483 --> 03:23:49,102
MARISHA: Especially when they keep growing. Like,
jeez.

2607
03:23:49,102 --> 03:23:53,825
BRIAN: I read that in a Danielle Steel--

2608
03:23:53,825 --> 03:23:58,168
MARISHA: I will say, when we cosplayed and did our
opening title sequence and I was wearing those

2609
03:23:58,168 --> 03:24:02,282
things, there's no practicality in that shit. It
was awful.

2610
03:24:02,282 --> 03:24:03,523
LAURA: Those things were in the way!

2611
03:24:03,523 --> 03:24:04,851
MARISHA: They were always in the fucking way.

2612
03:24:04,851 --> 03:24:09,320
BRIAN: Some of the great Keyleth cosplay they are
even more extreme.

2613
03:24:09,320 --> 03:24:14,390
MARISHA: We all suffer as one! Impractical
antlers!

2614
03:24:14,390 --> 03:24:18,848
TALIESIN: Keyleth and Loki cosplayers are really
upset.

2615
03:24:18,848 --> 03:24:21,455
BRIAN: All the Hela cosplayers are going to be in
on that, too.

2616
03:24:21,455 --> 03:24:23,526
MARISHA: Yeah, I stabbed everyone that day.

2617
03:24:23,526 --> 03:24:32,029
BRIAN: At least once. Matt, @Marion_Avalon wants
to know, "Did you know what Sam had planned with

2618
03:24:32,029 --> 03:24:36,662
"his level nine spell to save Vax?"

2619
03:24:36,662 --> 03:24:37,659
MATT: Vax, you mean.

2620
03:24:37,659 --> 03:24:40,664
BRIAN: That's what I said. I said it very lazily.

2621
03:24:40,664 --> 03:24:49,453
MATT: I knew that you had an inclination because
you came to me and asked, "What can this spell

2622
03:24:49,453 --> 03:24:56,233
"affect?" It's such a broad spell. I outlined some
vague ideas. It's powerful because it has so many

2623
03:24:56,233 --> 03:25:01,426
things that it can do, but there are limits to its
power and what it can achieve, so it's important

2624
03:25:01,426 --> 03:25:11,074
to consider timing, scope, specific words. I knew
that you had possible interest in using it. I tried

2625
03:25:11,074 --> 03:25:15,249
not to outline too specifically and give you the
space. I knew it was a possibility, but also it's

2626
03:25:15,249 --> 03:25:19,677
a clutch spell for battle, it has so many great
uses. I didn't know if it was going to show up at

2627
03:25:19,677 --> 03:25:24,956
all at that moment. So when you said that as the
Counterspell in the final battle, it hit me: all

2628
03:25:24,956 --> 03:25:29,763
the conversations we had, it all hit at once. You
can see it on my face on the episode. I'm just

2629
03:25:29,763 --> 03:25:38,445
like, "Oh. Shit. Okay! Oh, god." Yeah. For some
reason, I knew that was a possibility, but that

2630
03:25:38,445 --> 03:25:43,314
moment was when it hit me, the ramifications of
that choice and that moment. It's one of my

2631
03:25:43,314 --> 03:25:44,756
favorite moments of the game.

2632
03:25:44,756 --> 03:25:47,256
SAM: Me too. It was great. Awful.

2633
03:25:47,256 --> 03:25:56,071
BRIAN: Sam, I have to primer you. This question
may sound aggressive or perhaps-- it's a little

2634
03:25:56,071 --> 03:26:01,090
rough. But bear with me. This is from
Cardamonelaw. I understand what he's saying, I'm

2635
03:26:01,090 --> 03:26:08,793
not saying he said it fuckerdly. "Scanlan went
toe-to-toe with a god, and between True Polymorph

2636
03:26:08,793 --> 03:26:16,015
"and Wish, can potentially do almost anything...
except save or bring back his friend. How do you

2637
03:26:16,015 --> 03:26:18,497
"imagine he--" It gets worse.

2638
03:26:18,497 --> 03:26:19,989
MARISHA: Oh god!

2639
03:26:19,989 --> 03:26:21,594
SAM: Also, you're ugly.

2640
03:26:21,594 --> 03:26:26,418
BRIAN: No! Nothing nearly as--

2641
03:26:26,418 --> 03:26:28,714
SAM: In real life. The question is--

2642
03:26:28,714 --> 03:26:35,964
BRIAN: "How do you imagine he reconciles being
both all-powerful yet completely powerless in his

2643
03:26:35,964 --> 03:26:37,101
"retirement?"

2644
03:26:37,101 --> 03:26:50,778
SAM: I mean. He can't. Reconcile? I think he feels
like it was a big opportunity lost and that he

2645
03:26:50,778 --> 03:26:57,859
ultimately failed, but probably as he gets to be
in his older age and surrounded by people he loves

2646
03:26:57,859 --> 03:27:10,243
that he realizes that it's okay to fail. You don't
have to succeed in everything to make a difference

2647
03:27:10,243 --> 03:27:19,958
in people's' lives who you care about. He'll just
try to be a hero for his wife and his kid. And

2648
03:27:19,958 --> 03:27:28,515
that's it. He still might use Wish every once in a
while to see if maybe he can get a message to or

2649
03:27:28,515 --> 03:27:33,539
from old Vax, but I don't know if it ever works.
Probably not.

2650
03:27:33,539 --> 03:27:39,498
LIAM: Vax would never see that as a failure. Never
see Scanlan as a failure.

2651
03:27:39,498 --> 03:27:46,646
MATT: I imagine out of that standing guilt that a
lot of stories, a lot of tales told about the

2652
03:27:46,646 --> 03:27:54,124
deeds and memory of Vax'ildan and the great things
he did. I don't know.

2653
03:27:54,124 --> 03:28:00,569
SAM: Also, I think part of his maturing process
over the whole campaign was learning it's okay not

2654
03:28:00,569 --> 03:28:06,684
to be the center of attention. It's okay not to be
the best at everything. It's okay to just do what

2655
03:28:06,684 --> 03:28:08,903
you do if you do it for the right reasons.

2656
03:28:08,903 --> 03:28:16,993
BRIAN: I agree completely. Wow. That's a much
better answer than I was anticipating. Laura, how

2657
03:28:16,993 --> 03:28:26,143
great is this question for Matt? This is from
Myrynorunshot. "What was on the opposite side of

2658
03:28:26,143 --> 03:28:29,071
"Entropis from the lab the party passed through?"

2659
03:28:29,071 --> 03:28:37,633
MATT: Oh! In the tower Entropis. The side you guys
went up had the bodies, the torturing devices and

2660
03:28:37,633 --> 03:28:43,301
such. The opposite side you didn't go up had a
bunch of ancient holy relics that had been

2661
03:28:43,301 --> 03:28:47,432
sundered and destroyed. It was the research
laboratory for the creation of the seed that

2662
03:28:47,432 --> 03:28:56,175
ascended Vecna. One side was the torture,
mutilation, gathering of information from the

2663
03:28:56,175 --> 03:29:01,735
flesh. The other side was the desecration,
destruction, and tearing of information from ancient

2664
03:29:01,735 --> 03:29:08,368
relics past. The two together is what eventually
led to preparation for the Ritual of Seeding,

2665
03:29:08,368 --> 03:29:09,828
which allowed his ascension.

2666
03:29:09,828 --> 03:29:11,340
MARISHA: Wait, which side did we go up?

2667
03:29:11,340 --> 03:29:12,613
MATT: There were two sides to the tower.

2668
03:29:12,613 --> 03:29:13,884
MARISHA: Yeah, which one of the--

2669
03:29:13,884 --> 03:29:17,863
MATT: You went up the side where you found the
bodies and the torture devices. You saw familiar faces.

2670
03:29:17,863 --> 03:29:22,126
MARISHA: The other one would have been the relics?
Okay.

2671
03:29:22,126 --> 03:29:24,297
SAM: For next time.

2672
03:29:24,297 --> 03:29:26,756
TALIESIN: Temple Run.

2673
03:29:26,756 --> 03:29:33,297
BRIAN: Taliesin. Cat1832 wants to know, "What were
you originally envisioning for Percy's ending?"

2674
03:29:33,297 --> 03:29:39,486
TALIESIN: Percy was going to save Vax. Percy was
going to make a deal at the last minute and sell

2675
03:29:39,486 --> 03:29:47,412
his soul, get the punishment he felt he deserved
eventually when death came. Even though he

2676
03:29:47,412 --> 03:29:51,325
understood that that contract would go horribly
wrong, he would've convinced himself that it

2677
03:29:51,325 --> 03:29:57,821
didn't matter where he went when he died anyway.
He was of the impression, "I'm going somewhere

2678
03:29:57,821 --> 03:30:00,919
"awful already. Why not get something out of it?"

2679
03:30:00,919 --> 03:30:10,838
And then once doubt crept in, it became
that weird moment of: what am I doing with my life

2680
03:30:10,838 --> 03:30:20,779
and why am I making all these poor decisions?! I
don't know how I lied to myself to convince myself

2681
03:30:20,779 --> 03:30:22,964
that was going to work, but somehow it worked.

2682
03:30:22,964 --> 03:30:28,585
MATT: To be fair, if you had called in the last
part of the contract and been granted the wish, if

2683
03:30:28,585 --> 03:30:35,274
it was carefully placed, you could've found a way
to alter or adjust it because the deal hadn't been

2684
03:30:35,274 --> 03:30:40,135
closed. The same way that Scanlan was going to,
but once again at the cost of your own personal

2685
03:30:40,135 --> 03:30:47,743
soul. I don't know, it's interesting. That moment
for Percival, that whole sequence leading up to

2686
03:30:47,743 --> 03:30:51,472
and after that was my favorite Percival moment.

2687
03:30:51,472 --> 03:30:53,922
TALIESIN: I was not okay for days after that.

2688
03:30:53,922 --> 03:30:55,686
MATT: I watched you break. It was wonderful.

2689
03:30:55,686 --> 03:30:57,170
TALIESIN: It was rough!

2690
03:30:57,170 --> 03:31:03,166
LIAM: Also, to both of those questions: if either
of them had tried to get the Wish spell off, I

2691
03:31:03,166 --> 03:31:07,743
don't even know how it would have played out. It's
complicated because in my mind as a player, the

2692
03:31:07,743 --> 03:31:16,026
only way I was going to live is if the Raven Queen
said, "You pass the test. Go. Live. Be happy and

2693
03:31:16,026 --> 03:31:19,830
"have a handful of years." That was the only way in
my mind.

2694
03:31:19,830 --> 03:31:21,918
BRIAN: Did any part of you anticipate that
happening?

2695
03:31:21,918 --> 03:31:23,966
LIAM: No, I thought it was a 5% chance.

2696
03:31:23,966 --> 03:31:32,943
BRIAN: So you're saying there's a chance. Travis.
We're close to the end here. @Aegis_of_Ages wants

2697
03:31:32,943 --> 03:31:36,285
to know, "What was Grog thinking about when he
decided to seek an education?"

2698
03:31:36,285 --> 03:31:42,290
TRAVIS: Oh. I think he just wanted to get
smarter.

2699
03:31:42,290 --> 03:31:52,948
BRIAN: That's pretty good. Matt. @PhoenixHeart815,
"What was Syldor's reaction to Vax's death?"

2700
03:31:52,948 --> 03:32:05,767
MATT: Grief. Though they were estranged for many
years, he regrets the treatment of his two twin

2701
03:32:05,767 --> 03:32:11,167
children and has been spending a large part of his
life thereafter trying to reconcile the choices he made

2702
03:32:11,167 --> 03:32:20,932
as a father to them. Beyond the grief and sadness
there, there's a lot of pride in the things that

2703
03:32:20,932 --> 03:32:29,934
he's learning that his son accomplished, and his twin
daughter has continued to go into. He's learned a

2704
03:32:29,934 --> 03:32:41,776
lot of lessons about the issues in Syngorn's
society and acceptance of other races, cultures.

2705
03:32:41,776 --> 03:32:50,588
He's doing the best he can, within his own lower
political position, to try and influence future

2706
03:32:50,588 --> 03:32:56,107
generations and politics between the nations to be
a little more open.

2707
03:32:56,107 --> 03:33:02,635
BRIAN: Yeah. On a related note, Laura, from
@GloraiRokicki, "Did Vex's relationship with her

2708
03:33:02,635 --> 03:33:05,488
"father change after she saved Velora's life?"

2709
03:33:05,488 --> 03:33:14,193
LAURA: Yeah, that's one of the things that we
talked about. Later in life, they made peace with

2710
03:33:14,193 --> 03:33:27,590
each other. She worked to rebuild that
relationship. That came from having five kids with

2711
03:33:27,590 --> 03:33:35,920
Percy and going: Oh, this is what family means.
This is what having children means. It suddenly

2712
03:33:35,920 --> 03:33:40,632
became very important in a different way to reach
out to Syldor.

2713
03:33:40,632 --> 03:33:49,231
BRIAN: Yeah. Our final round here. This is from
@Zelda_CR_Fan, "What happened with Vax and the

2714
03:33:49,231 --> 03:33:55,080
"Raven Queen after his death? Did he keep her
company as she once mentioned or did he simply

2715
03:33:55,080 --> 03:33:56,648
"have a peaceful afterlife?"

2716
03:33:56,648 --> 03:34:03,137
MATT: I don't want to answer too much of this
because I like to leave the ethereal essence of

2717
03:34:03,137 --> 03:34:11,116
these questions to interpretation. I think a
little bit of both. As part of that process, Vax

2718
03:34:11,116 --> 03:34:19,402
was able to reconnect with the spirit of his
mother, even if temporarily or occasionally. But

2719
03:34:19,402 --> 03:34:26,138
also, as was decided and discussed between the two
of them, prevent an element of loneliness in that

2720
03:34:26,138 --> 03:34:35,720
transition for her. The small section of mortal
self that she maintains takes solace in keeping

2721
03:34:35,720 --> 03:34:44,093
the champions close. Ever watching and doing the
work she needs. I don't want to go any deeper than

2722
03:34:44,093 --> 03:34:45,998
that because I don't think I need to.

2723
03:34:45,998 --> 03:34:51,324
BRIAN: I understand. Also, Cardamonelaw wanted to
know, "Was there any other means of stopping the

2724
03:34:51,324 --> 03:34:54,271
"Titan other than binding and slaying Vecna?"

2725
03:34:54,271 --> 03:35:00,955
MATT: That was one of the things we mentioned earlier.
The Titanstone Gauntlets. Destroying it from the

2726
03:35:00,955 --> 03:35:04,977
inside, hobbling it from the interior. Those were
really the only means that would have functioned.

2727
03:35:04,977 --> 03:35:11,987
The exterior was too powerful. It could only be
damaged from the inside. It's serious business.

2728
03:35:11,987 --> 03:35:20,820
BRIAN: Wow. Titans are no joke. Our last few
questions are perhaps the most potent. Marisha,

2729
03:35:20,820 --> 03:35:28,452
@BrandieFree wants to know, "Would Keyleth ever
cast Speak with Animals on the large raven that

2730
03:35:28,452 --> 03:35:30,194
"visits her every day?"

2731
03:35:30,194 --> 03:35:39,153
MARISHA: I think she would've hesitantly tried.
Yeah. I don't know if she would've gotten the

2732
03:35:39,153 --> 03:35:47,199
results that would've wanted, which is why she
would even be so tentative to doing it in the

2733
03:35:47,199 --> 03:35:53,583
first place. Almost better to keep the illusion it
for sure is Vax than the confirmation that it

2734
03:35:53,583 --> 03:35:56,427
might not be at all.

2735
03:35:56,427 --> 03:35:59,097
BRIAN: What if you did and it was like, "I'm
Gary!"

2736
03:35:59,097 --> 03:36:02,740
MARISHA: Totally! I was like: Oh, fuck you, bird.

2737
03:36:02,784 --> 03:36:07,146
TRAVIS: It's been 300 years!

2738
03:36:07,146 --> 03:36:13,745
MARISHA: Yeah! I think she might eventually, but I
don't think she would right away.

2739
03:36:13,745 --> 03:36:16,068
LAURA: I'm Gary!

2740
03:36:16,068 --> 03:36:18,242
MATT: I like your hair!

2741
03:36:18,242 --> 03:36:20,343
MARISHA: Feed me!

2742
03:36:20,343 --> 03:36:22,297
SAM: I come everyday because you feed me!

2743
03:36:22,297 --> 03:36:25,052
MARISHA: Aww.

2744
03:36:25,052 --> 03:36:36,179
BRIAN: Man, what a beautiful answer. Travis,
Xarkost wants to know, "What were the final

2745
03:36:36,179 --> 03:36:39,396
"contents of the bag of holding?"

2746
03:36:39,396 --> 03:36:49,246
TRAVIS: Oh man. There was a shitload of
silverware. There were some candles, stones. I had a

2747
03:36:49,246 --> 03:36:51,507
shitload of caltrops and handcuffs.

2748
03:36:51,507 --> 03:36:54,318
LAURA: Dried poo in there.

2749
03:36:54,318 --> 03:37:02,333
TRAVIS: Yeah. The dried poo disc broke, though. I
had a nice, solid cow frisbee patty. There was

2750
03:37:02,333 --> 03:37:10,697
some armor. The big black sapphire I gave to
Scanlan to get married to old Pikey-poo with. A

2751
03:37:10,697 --> 03:37:17,182
shitload of expensive-ass bottles of wine.
Basically a bunch of other random shit. It was

2752
03:37:17,182 --> 03:37:24,889
like a busted-up Home Depot at the end. Percy
probably could've made something from it all. I

2753
03:37:24,889 --> 03:37:26,971
was just randomly collecting shit.

2754
03:37:26,971 --> 03:37:31,499
LIAM: (singing) And a troll dick in some mage
robes.

2755
03:37:31,499 --> 03:37:41,237
LAURA: Forever, I have the Kevdak skin in the bag of
colding. Just a big piece of skin.

2756
03:37:41,237 --> 03:37:43,943
TRAVIS: There's 10,000 pieces of platinum in the
bag.

2757
03:37:43,943 --> 03:37:45,297
LAURA: Shut--!

2758
03:37:45,297 --> 03:37:53,950
BRIAN: Liam, F3ntin wants to know, "How does Vax
feel about his ending? Is he a little bit bitter

2759
03:37:53,950 --> 03:37:58,663
"about how soon it was or is he only concerned for
his friends and accepts his fate gladly?"

2760
03:37:58,663 --> 03:38:05,840
LIAM: In the final moments? I don't think there's
an answer for after. This is similar-- mystery is

2761
03:38:05,840 --> 03:38:14,103
better. But in the last moments? No, he was not
bitter. It was very heavy. He felt very full as

2762
03:38:14,103 --> 03:38:22,406
well and knew that his sister was taken care of.

2763
03:38:22,477 --> 03:38:26,289
(laughter)

2764
03:38:26,289 --> 03:38:28,584
BRIAN: She lived to annoy you.

2765
03:38:28,584 --> 03:38:30,911
LIAM: I don't know what to say.

2766
03:38:30,911 --> 03:38:39,668
BRIAN: I get it. Yeah. Ashley, this brings us to
perhaps our most-asked question for this entire

2767
03:38:39,668 --> 03:38:46,518
wrap-up episode. @IfThenAnderson was the lucky
person got their version of the question chosen.

2768
03:38:46,518 --> 03:38:52,635
"Who was Pike's other love interest, and how did
she come to reconcile those emotions with her

2769
03:38:52,635 --> 03:38:57,403
"ultimate choice of" extremely settling for,
"Scanlan?"

2770
03:38:57,403 --> 03:39:12,503
ASHLEY: Well, for a very long time it was Percy. I
think that--

2771
03:39:12,503 --> 03:39:17,019
MARISHA: Get it! Getting all the Vox Machina
ladies! All three of us.

2772
03:39:17,019 --> 03:39:30,075
ASHLEY: I think she saw through her faith and the
light that she carried within her that he was a

2773
03:39:30,075 --> 03:39:38,382
marked man. She could see the weight on his
shoulders and the darkness that he carried with

2774
03:39:38,382 --> 03:39:49,760
him. She did so much thinking and praying for his
soul. I think all of that time spent on him was

2775
03:39:49,760 --> 03:40:02,577
confusing to her. Obviously, it never would've
worked! But in the end, it was always Scanlan. I

2776
03:40:02,577 --> 03:40:09,464
think there was some time there where she was a
little taken by the dark side.

2777
03:40:09,464 --> 03:40:11,876
MATT: She wanted to fix him!

2778
03:40:11,876 --> 03:40:18,401
TALIESIN: Way to dodge a bullet there, Ashley! He
was oblivious, man.

2779
03:40:18,401 --> 03:40:20,745
SAM: Even Taryon fell in love with that guy!

2780
03:40:20,745 --> 03:40:24,246
LAURA: True! What the fuck!

2781
03:40:24,246 --> 03:40:26,693
SAM: Everybody loves Percy, and he's like the
worst!

2782
03:40:26,693 --> 03:40:33,066
MATT: Don't let anyone ever say that humans aren't a good
race to choose in D&amp;D because you're going to get

2783
03:40:33,066 --> 03:40:35,249
all the folks up on you.

2784
03:40:35,249 --> 03:40:41,680
TALIESIN: Percy didn't have a fucking clue,
either. Last to know anything.

2785
03:40:41,680 --> 03:40:50,628
BRIAN: Just a clueless teenage asshole. Our final
question of the night, my favorite, could really

2786
03:40:50,628 --> 03:40:57,289
not have come from a better screen name and that
is the PragmaticBeaver. Thank you, whoever you are

2787
03:40:57,289 --> 03:41:05,145
out there. This is for everyone to answer. We
don't have to go in order, if you feel compelled,

2788
03:41:05,145 --> 03:41:10,147
if you think of something, just answer. "When your
characters look back at their time as world

2789
03:41:10,147 --> 03:41:17,500
"renowned adventurers, what memories stand out the
most as moments they will never forget?"

2790
03:41:17,500 --> 03:41:22,582
TRAVIS: Dropping on Kevdak from the necklace. Bar
none.

2791
03:41:22,582 --> 03:41:27,481
LIAM: Saying goodbye.

2792
03:41:27,481 --> 03:41:37,092
MARISHA: Yeah. Cherry blossoms in the tree in the
Voice of the Tempest ceremony.

2793
03:41:37,092 --> 03:41:38,942
LIAM: Cows.

2794
03:41:38,942 --> 03:41:41,125
LAURA: Oh, cows!

2795
03:41:41,125 --> 03:41:45,279
MARISHA: God, so many.

2796
03:41:45,279 --> 03:41:49,410
LAURA: Talking to Trinket for the first time!

2797
03:41:49,410 --> 03:41:55,634
SAM: Trying to kill Trinket. For the first time.

2798
03:41:55,634 --> 03:42:01,673
LIAM: Gilmore stabbing me.

2799
03:42:01,673 --> 03:42:06,286
LAURA: Flying. Fucking flying.

2800
03:42:06,286 --> 03:42:12,535
MARISHA: The hanging tree. That one stuck with
me.

2801
03:42:12,535 --> 03:42:18,768
TALIESIN: Letting go when Ripley shot me.
Actually, on the other end of that, realizing that

2802
03:42:18,768 --> 03:42:23,067
Percy was in love with Vex was pretty impressive.
I've never had that kind of PC character

2803
03:42:23,067 --> 03:42:26,480
interaction before. That was a strange moment.

2804
03:42:26,480 --> 03:42:32,482
BRIAN: Matt, some moments for you that you're
going to remember beyond however many other games you

2805
03:42:32,482 --> 03:42:35,990
play, or even this next adventure?

2806
03:42:35,990 --> 03:42:39,453
MATT: Everything they've mentioned here and so
many more. It's hard to pick, it really is,

2807
03:42:39,453 --> 03:42:41,071
there's so many.

2808
03:42:41,071 --> 03:42:42,460
MARISHA: They feel like real memories.

2809
03:42:42,460 --> 03:42:43,661
MATT: They do. They are.

2810
03:42:43,661 --> 03:42:44,981
TRAVIS: They are!

2811
03:42:44,981 --> 03:42:46,713
MATT: It's the magic of this.

2812
03:42:46,713 --> 03:42:54,947
SAM: I always figured Scanlan would tell their
stories or whatever. And he will and he'll try to

2813
03:42:54,947 --> 03:43:00,942
and everything, but I thought about this,
actually, while we were playing. For him, anyway,

2814
03:43:00,942 --> 03:43:11,970
it was not the epic stories of glory and saving
the world. He would have liked just impressing his

2815
03:43:11,970 --> 03:43:20,882
friends and healing them or inspiring them. Just
the friendship. That was his favorite moments from

2816
03:43:20,882 --> 03:43:23,301
the epic journey.

2817
03:43:23,301 --> 03:43:30,396
TALIESIN: Eventually, you produce a rap/hip-hop
show based off of our adventures. It's a huge hit.

2818
03:43:30,396 --> 03:43:34,282
MARISHA: Remember the cannonball competition in
the pool? That was great.

2819
03:43:34,282 --> 03:43:42,730
LIAM: Vax was pretty impressed, <i>I</i> was pretty
impressed in that last fight when we realized

2820
03:43:42,730 --> 03:43:47,232
you'd been fighting with your hand tied behind
your back the whole time, saving that spell.

2821
03:43:47,232 --> 03:43:49,163
SAM: I almost did it, too!

2822
03:43:49,163 --> 03:43:54,613
LAURA: Scanlan was pretty impressive the whole
fricking time, let's be honest.

2823
03:43:54,613 --> 03:43:58,339
TALIESIN: Your fight in Whitestone was pretty
intense.

2824
03:43:58,339 --> 03:44:02,741
MATT: Can I say, as a man who grew up playing
Dungeons &amp; Dragons and continuously being told

2825
03:44:02,741 --> 03:44:10,173
that bards were the worst class and that charisma
was a fucking dump stat and fighting that because

2826
03:44:10,173 --> 03:44:14,915
I knew the potential for storytelling with that
kind of a character. Even though older editions

2827
03:44:14,915 --> 03:44:19,530
didn't do them service, they've done better as
they've gotten out. I'm so thankful that you

2828
03:44:19,530 --> 03:44:25,395
stepped up to the challenge of the "worst
character" and "worst race" and shown just how

2829
03:44:25,395 --> 03:44:26,725
amazing it can be.

2830
03:44:26,725 --> 03:44:27,895
TRAVIS: Hear hear!

2831
03:44:27,895 --> 03:44:32,587
SAM: Well, I will do the opposite in the next
campaign.

2832
03:44:32,587 --> 03:44:36,830
BRIAN: Ashley, any memories that stick out to
you?

2833
03:44:36,830 --> 03:44:49,410
ASHLEY: It's all just a little bit more personal.
I think it goes back to my first game. That

2834
03:44:49,410 --> 03:44:53,150
changed my life.

2835
03:44:53,150 --> 03:44:56,826
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2836
03:44:56,826 --> 03:45:02,841
MATT: It changed all our lives, dramatically. I
mean, we have this family now.

2837
03:45:02,841 --> 03:45:10,494
BRIAN: Yeah. Indeed. And an extended one, too.
Matt, I'm interested from your perspective, having

2838
03:45:10,494 --> 03:45:15,317
some of these people never even touched D&amp;D
before, and here we are at the end of this thing,

2839
03:45:15,317 --> 03:45:29,077
and not only are they moderate to low-level okay D&amp;D
players-- But to see how they've woven story and

2840
03:45:29,077 --> 03:45:37,739
character and improv and the D&amp;D system. Five
years later and at the end of this arc of these

2841
03:45:37,739 --> 03:45:44,115
characters, you must be not only proud, but just
excited to continue on now that, to some extent,

2842
03:45:44,115 --> 03:45:47,310
most of them outside of Sam know what they're
doing now.

2843
03:45:47,310 --> 03:45:59,840
MATT: It's true. It's weird. It's very strange to
look at myself as a 35 year old man who has spent

2844
03:45:59,840 --> 03:46:06,172
his entire life trying desperately to do something
with his life, and to genuinely believe that the

2845
03:46:06,172 --> 03:46:15,031
greatest thing I've accomplished is with you guys,
in this. I mean, that's the truth. That's the

2846
03:46:15,031 --> 03:46:24,859
truth. I am so proud and so happy to have been
part of this with you guys. And we get to make a

2847
03:46:24,859 --> 03:46:26,712
new one soon!

2848
03:46:26,712 --> 03:46:28,853
TRAVIS: We get to go back to the beginning!

2849
03:46:28,853 --> 03:46:36,620
BRIAN: I will end with a sentiment that might
sound cliché, but I've been thinking for weeks,

2850
03:46:36,620 --> 03:46:44,349
and trying to sum up my feelings in some way about
this whole thing, only coming in-- I've been with

2851
03:46:44,349 --> 03:46:51,262
it since the beginning, but coming into it in an
official capacity a year ago and halfway through

2852
03:46:51,262 --> 03:46:57,006
the thing has been incredible, and I will leave
you with the words my grandfather used to say,

2853
03:46:57,067 --> 03:47:00,937
which sounds so cliché, but he used to say, "When
God closes a door,

2854
03:47:00,937 --> 03:47:07,206
"he opens a new campaign January 11th." 
And that is all the time we have--

2855
03:47:07,206 --> 03:47:15,808
(laughter)

2856
03:47:15,808 --> 03:47:23,657
BRIAN: For this wrap up of Vox Machina's
adventures. Make sure to tune in to our very

2857
03:47:23,657 --> 03:47:30,187

2859
03:47:35,762 --> 03:47:42,035

and don't worry. Jesus, it's Christm-- It's

2862
03:47:54,672 --> 03:48:02,266
Thursday. It's almost Critmas. Stay turnt, my
friends.

2863
03:48:02,266 --> 03:53:01,589
