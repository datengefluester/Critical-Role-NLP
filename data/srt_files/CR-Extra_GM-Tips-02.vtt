NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.222 line:1
MATT: Hey everyone! My name is 
Matthew Mercer. I'm a voice actor

00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:05.942 line:1
and the Dungeon Master for 
Geek and Sundry's Critical Role,

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:08.672
and welcome to my video series with 
tips and tricks on Dungeon Mastering

00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:13.822
or Game Mastering your own RPG. Today, we're 
talking about NPC creation: one of my favorite topics.

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:16.563
[trumpet fanfare]

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:18.513
MATT: Things you want to consider when 
creating your NPCs: first and foremost,

NOTE Paragraph

00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:24.023
are they a major or a minor NPC? I mean, if you have a lot of
free time on your hands, you can flesh out every person

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:30.172
in the world to an extreme degree, but at the same
time, that can get a little... ominous. So when

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:33.727
you're thinking of a minor NPC, you want to think
of just the basic elements of their character:

00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:37.703 line:1
think of their name, their sex, their race, their
class (if any). And they don't have to always be

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:43.953 line:1
classes from the player's choices - they can be
Merchant, they can be Butcher, they can be the guy

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:47.893
who cleans the bathrooms in the space lodge, you
know? You don't have to be too particular, but

00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:53.370
note those things. Note their general alignment or
morality, if they have any political or social

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.822
affiliations in the world that you've created or
you're currently running. That helps as well. If

00:00:57.822 --> 00:01:02.532
they belong to any guilds. Any major allies or
enemies they might have. But all you need is quick

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:04.870
notes just in case those come up in conversation.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.193
As you get more intense about NPCs, and more major
ones, you start considering, "What are their

00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:15.723 line:1
ideals? What are their desires? What are their fears?"
Those are really cool driving elements

00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:19.431
that you can understand where that character
exists in your world, and when players have

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:24.992
conversations with them, where a lot of their
answers would come from. You also want to keep a

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:29.791
little note on what their disposition is towards the
players. Sometimes they'll start indifferent,

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:33.152
or even hostile, but depending on their actions and
how the players interact with them, they can

00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:37.121
become their friends. [baby voice] Their fwiends. And
you want to make sure you note that on the

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:40.703
side for future use if they ever come back. Or, if they
do something really terrible down the road,

00:01:40.703 --> 00:01:43.602
that can completely flip to the other side.
[serious voice] Not fwiends.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:48.133 line:1
Also note their appearance, their equipment, what their
special skills and mannerisms may be,

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:52.453 line:1
especially if they're going to be a recurring NPC. And if
they ever decide to fight alongside the

00:01:52.453 --> 00:01:55.943
party or help them out tremendously to some extents,
you want to know what they're capable of

00:01:55.943 --> 00:02:00.770
and maybe hint that to the players through some
social encounters, which is kind of fun.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.584 line:1
If they're planning to go into battle, whether it be as an
ally or an enemy, put up a combat sheet that

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:09.742 line:1
generally lists what abilities they have. You can
definitely make things up on the fly, but I prefer

00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:13.592
and would recommend having something solid on the
side at all times, even if it never comes into

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:17.292
play, just in case it does. It's really helpful, and
you'll be glad you had that, as opposed to

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:22.462
sweating it last minute going, "Uh, I-- he has, 
um-- laser sword."

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:27.822
If you're doing silly voices, like I do-- I do a lot of
silly voices. A lot of them. It helps keep

00:02:27.822 --> 00:02:32.525 line:1
the psychosis at bay-- keep a note of what type of
vocal texture or tone or accent you used for that

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:37.611 line:1
NPC so if they come back later, you can quickly
reference the ballpark of where you had them. If

00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:42.132
they had a high, shrill voice, if they had a thin,
reedy voice, if they had a low, gravelly voice, if

00:02:42.132 --> 00:02:47.632
they had a very intense militaristic tone, if they had
a particular dialect or accent, just write

00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:51.933
little notes in the side to that NPC so that you know
exactly where to jump in if the players go,

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:55.762
"Oh, we're going to go visit Timmy this week!" and
you're like, "Timmy? Timmy was nine months ago.

00:02:55.762 --> 00:02:59.583
[voice cracks] I don't remember what Timmy sounds
like." But they'll remember. They always remember.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:04.873
There are also a lot of great resources and a lot of
source books like the RPG Dungeon Master's or

00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:09.580 line:1
Game Master's Guide or any of the source books,
the main books. They have really great tools for

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.273 line:1
creating NPCs that involve personality traits,
story hook backstories for them, and cool places

00:03:15.273 --> 00:03:19.813
to branch off and create someone from, so don't be
afraid to do some research. Don't feel like it's

00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:23.613
lesser of you to pull from the books; they're there for
a reason and they're wonderful resources.

NOTE Paragraph

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:31.250
One of the most important aspects of a good story,
though, is a good villain. And creating a good

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.953
villain can be many things but it's something you
want to make sure to put enough energy and effort

00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:40.032 line:1
into. For one, not all villains think they're villains.
Their morality may be skewed, and they

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:44.012 line:1
have their own personal goals, but what they're doing
is for their own beliefs and for their own

00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:49.911
personal interests, and they may see others as the
villains of their own story. So try to flesh out

00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:55.192
why they're doing the things they're doing. What
are the driving experiences in their life that

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:59.825
gave them this twisted righteousness? What acts
have they done in the past that mark them as evil

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:03.192
in this world or from the player's perspective?
These are cool things to keep in mind going

00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:07.902
forward. Also, good versus evil, black and white,
that can work every now and then, but it's really

00:04:07.902 --> 00:04:12.012 line:1
fun to play in areas of gray. As you will find
out, or have already, players tend to play in

00:04:12.012 --> 00:04:16.912 line:1
areas of gray. No matter how good you make your
characters, weird, sometimes not-so-good things

00:04:16.912 --> 00:04:22.231
happen in games and characters spontaneously end
up dead and you have to hide bodies. Happens.

00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:25.612
Often. So, you know, villains also can play in areas
of gray. Sometimes a character who starts

00:04:25.612 --> 00:04:29.601
good can turn evil. A character that starts evil
can turn good. Sometimes they just borderline that

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:33.659
middle area where even the players aren't sure if
they're good or evil for a lot of the game and

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:38.132
it's one of those, "Are they useful in the moment?"
It's fun to leave those questions up to

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:41.924
them and let them make those choices. And you
secretly know what the outcome is. Haha!

00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:45.921 line:1
Now as far as grandiose villains, it's good to
choose an archetype. And a really great reference

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:50.902 line:1
that I pull from is the classic DnD book called
Book of Vile Darkness. The 3.5 one in particular

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:55.441
has a wonderful breakdown on deliciously built
villains. They have archetypes like the scheming

00:04:55.441 --> 00:05:01.634
liar, the tyrant, the sophisticate, the misguided fool,
or the monster. These are all different,

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:06.383
great personality types that you can build a great
villain off of. The sophisticate, in particular -

00:05:06.383 --> 00:05:12.549
one that's very involved in societal, grandiose
attention, and uses society to get their means,

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:17.195
and sees themselves as definitely an erudite and
above-it-all type persona, is really fun - versus

00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:20.754
the monster, which is the straight-up murderer,
a person that relishes in the death and destruction

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:24.983
they cause. You can pick from any of these and
customize and alter from those bases, but I

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:28.581
find that those are five really cool bases to
build a villain off of.

00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:31.842 line:1
And then once you've created a cool villain,
consider how much power do they wield? Are they

00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:37.212 line:1
solo? Are they just this unbridled force of chaos
in the world, or do they have a network of

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:41.352 line:1
henchmen and people that work for them that
either agree with their cause or at least can be paid

00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:46.103
enough to go along with it? Is there some sort of long
reveal that you can build the character

00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:50.672
towards? - something about their history that's either
dark or very surprising that you can,

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:56.643
later on, pepper in clues to as the players progress.
These are cool things to discuss as you're

00:05:56.643 --> 00:06:01.972 line:1
building this villain. And don't be afraid to let
the villain have a grandiose death, no matter how

00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:06.752 line:1
attached you are. If the players are really smart
and really intelligent about it, sometimes the

00:06:06.752 --> 00:06:10.837
final encounter may not be as epic as you think,
and you don't want to steal that from the players

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:13.748
just because they were really clever and really
intelligent in how they approached it. Just make

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:19.406
sure you give him his Hans Gruber final scream as
he falls off the building into all of oblivion.

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:22.978
