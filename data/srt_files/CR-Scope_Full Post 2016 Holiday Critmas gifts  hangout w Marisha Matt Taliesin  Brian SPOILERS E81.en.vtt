NOTE Paragraph

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:11.583
MATT: All right. It has begun. People are starting
to join. Now it's over here, Taliesin.

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:12.869
TALIESIN: I know, I'm just--

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.056
MATT: No, don't avoid. You don't avoid, Taliesin.

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:17.664
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. Hi. Good morning. Good
afternoon? Good afternoon. God.

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:18.738
MATT: It's a--

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:20.568
TALIESIN: Wow. That was fast.

00:00:20.568 --> 00:00:25.055
MATT: Wow! Okay, that's picking up quickly. Hi
guys!

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:25.788
TALIESIN: Hello.

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:38.206
MATT: (laughs) We did the Critmas thing, the video
on Talks Machina a couple weeks ago. And then a

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:52.891
bunch of stuff came in afterward. To give you an
example-- --can. We have this, and this, and this--

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.475
TALIESIN: Here for scale.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:01:02.896
MATT: And this, and this. So we've got a couple
things to do. And Taliesin for scale.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:07.445
TALIESIN: Just so you can imagine, I'm about four
feet tall. That'll give you an idea of how big

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:11.000
this is. Give or take a few feet.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.428
MATT: A little bit. We're also very lazy. Don't
give us any shit that our tree is still up. Anyway.

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:19.631
TALIESIN: I like the tree.

00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:30.047
MATT: Hi guys! Happy New Year! Welcome to all the
chaos. Hope you're enjoying our pseudo break game

00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:34.951
on Thursday. Patrick Rothfuss was awesome, it was
great that he was able to come in last minute and

00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:40.628
hope he can make it next week. We'll see. Yes,
it's quite a few packages. We're going to do our

00:01:40.628 --> 00:01:43.834
best to try and get through them as fast as
possible. You guys are awesome. I got a hello from

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:47.019
Scotland, hello from England. Marisha is lighting
some incense.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:56.970
MARISHA: Hi guys! I'm realizing I look like a
fisherman right now.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.581
MATT: There you go, Fisher-isha.

00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:00.303
TALIESIN: Fish-a.

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:02.786
MARISHA: That's some high school shit right
there.

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:09.876
MATT: I'm sorry. I'm going to regret that later.
Me and Marisha are excited, we had a good day. We

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:17.759
locked in our wedding venue. Which we're happy
about, so finally got that situated. Anyway. "Is

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.970
"Boris okay?" We're still on the lookout for Boris.
Boris Watch 2017 is now in order.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.958
MARISHA: What watch?

00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:23.725
MATT: Boris watch.

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:25.286
MARISHA: Oh shit.

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:26.205
TALIESIN: Who's Boris?

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:28.812
MARISHA: Boris is a spider.

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:33.279
MATT: Boris. It's a story. Boris the spider is a
prick. People are saying your hat looks cozy, Marisha.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.221
MARISHA: Mmm. It's chilly.

00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:40.219
TALIESIN: It is a little chilly.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.527
MARISHA: Should I turn the heat up?

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.034
TALIESIN: (noncommittal sounds)

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:44.460
MARISHA: I'll turn the heat up just a tidbit.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.517
MATT: Turn the heat up. There you go. Just because
now I'm remembering. I'm going to do this for the

00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:52.653
guys who need it. We're going to go sideways.

00:02:52.653 --> 00:02:54.706
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's a thing. That makes life
better.

00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:55.492
MATT: There you go.

00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:57.173
TALIESIN: Somebody had to make a little edit
there, later.

00:02:57.173 --> 00:03:03.726
MATT: Yeah. That's for you, Critical Scope! That
was for you. So yeah, we're going to cruise

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:08.444
through these. We've got some box cutters.

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:10.838
TALIESIN: Tennis shoes. Sorry.

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:21.539
MATT: The usual. People are saying "beep beep"
from all over the world. Thank you, Andrew. Let's

00:03:21.782 --> 00:03:31.322
get this going so we don't keep you guys in too
long. You just TPKed your group? No! --characters now.

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:32.693
TALIESIN: Love a good TPK.

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:38.988
MATT: Love a good TPK? They happen a lot at the
lower levels. If you're not careful, at least.

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:43.460
Welcome guys, welcome to our little hang out.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.425
MARISHA: I love how we're sitting in front of the
Christmas tree, but it's not plugged in. It's like

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:48.161
a compromise.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:52.324
MATT: We can't plug the tree in, it's past
Christmas. This is the slow death of the tree,

00:03:52.324 --> 00:03:59.341
even though it's not a real tree. Oh! We've got
friends from all over the world today.

00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:00.143
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

00:04:00.143 --> 00:04:11.302
MATT: As well as CaptainNimoy, our good Irish
friend from the chatroom. Chat disappeared, but

00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:18.293
that's okay, came back on. All right, let's go
ahead and get some presents going here. I'll turn

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:23.426
this around; Marisha, Taliesin, you guys want to
get the front load of this. Here's a couple of box

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:33.755
cutters. I'll start passing this around. Let's
start grabbing some stuff! What you got?

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:35.509
TALIESIN: All right, here, I'll just--

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.388
MATT: Oh my god, we've got people from Overwatch
here. Hey guys! Welcome to our weekend chaos.

00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:43.089
TALIESIN: I've got one from Australia. All right.

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:51.096
MARISHA: Let's see. This is from, wait, this is to
Brian Foster.

00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:52.923
TALIESIN: Oh, well we should save it for Brian.

00:04:52.923 --> 00:04:56.064
MARISHA: Should I open it for him, though?

00:04:56.064 --> 00:04:59.584
TALIESIN: I'm amused at the notion of opening his
mail.

00:04:59.584 --> 00:05:02.484
MATT: Just do it. It's not illegal for his
friends.

00:05:02.484 --> 00:05:08.239
MARISHA: Well, it's Brian Foster, care of Critical
Role. Currently it is in the care of Critical Role.

00:05:08.644 --> 00:05:09.790
MATT: Sure. We've got to take care of it.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.926
MARISHA: He'll understand. Won't you, Brian? He
might be watching. He watches our shit.

00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:16.018
MATT: People are loving your hair, Taliesin.

00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:19.914
TALIESIN: Oh yay. Thank you! It just got done,
because I had to go to the DMV and this felt like

00:05:19.914 --> 00:05:20.918
the appropriate thing to do.

00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:25.270
MARISHA: I'm going to get mine done later. I'm so
stoked! I'm going to go back to purple, back to purple.

00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:27.724
TALIESIN: It's going to be great.

00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:29.884
MARISHA: What is happening?

00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:33.544
TALIESIN: You found tiny balls.

00:05:33.544 --> 00:05:42.443
MARISHA: There's lots of packing peanuts. I've got
a good confirmation on packing peanuts.

00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:44.116
TALIESIN: And a packing slip.

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:51.568
MARISHA: Oh! They're whiskey glasses.

00:05:51.568 --> 00:05:52.740
TALIESIN: Are they whiskey glasses?

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.490
MATT: Oh, Brian's going to love that.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.280
MARISHA: They're shot glasses, I think.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.147
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

00:05:57.147 --> 00:06:01.340
MARISHA: Oh nice. Oh my god! Foster!

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.450
MATT: Talks Machina shot glasses.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.442
TALIESIN: We're going to make sure Foster never
sees these. Ever.

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:08.036
MATT: Yeah. They're going to stay at our place.

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:11.796
MARISHA: (glass shattering) It's an extra Critical
Role one.

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:12.678
TALIESIN: Oh, nice.

00:06:12.678 --> 00:06:17.025
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. Okay. I've got to go grab
my phone and take a picture.

00:06:17.025 --> 00:06:21.116
MATT: We've got folks from Cork, Ireland in here.
From the Dominican Republic.

00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:22.307
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:28.653
MATT: This is awesome. South Jersey. Slovenia.
Holy s-- wow!

00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:29.513
TALIESIN: Awesome!

00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:31.417
MATT: Rhode Island. We've got people from all over
in here.

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:33.077
TALIESIN: This came from Australia.

00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:38.467
MATT: England. Chicago. Belgium. New Orleans.
Portland. Ohio. Scotland. Denmark. Oh man. I'm

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:40.098
going to be saying a lot of things here.

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:41.502
TALIESIN: Oh shit, son!

00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:46.434
MARISHA: This is from Eddie Chandler,
@chandlereddie1. And he says, "Hello, Brian. I

00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:50.899
"felt you needed one of the Critical Role Glasses.
However, please also find one especially for you

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.644
"and your show. Call it a late birthday/X-mas gift,
etc."

00:06:55.644 --> 00:06:58.123
MATT: That's awesome. Marisha, did you see what
Taliesin just--

00:06:58.123 --> 00:07:02.631
TALIESIN: From Australia. Tim-Tams and candy.

00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:03.247
MARISHA: Oh!

00:07:03.247 --> 00:07:05.612
MATT: We had just run out of Tim-Tams.

00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:07.816
TALIESIN: Oh my god. More sugar.

00:07:07.816 --> 00:07:10.921
MATT: Those who haven't tried a Tim-Tam slam,
seriously, you've got to.

00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:12.327
MARISHA: That's where it's at.

00:07:12.327 --> 00:07:15.199
MATT: Especially with hot coffee or hot cocoa.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.089
MARISHA: Oh my god. I might have to make some hot
chocolate right now. Fuck me.

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:28.022
TALIESIN: That might be post-- ooh, what's this?
Hold on, there's a letter here.

00:07:28.022 --> 00:07:36.504
MARISHA: Chocolate Freddo the Frog, a caramel
koala. What's a Buzz? Milk chocolate-covered

00:07:36.504 --> 00:07:39.947
marshmallow and caramel. Fuck yeah, man.

00:07:39.947 --> 00:07:42.458
TALIESIN: From CaspertheIttyBittyPuppy.

00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:46.520
MARISHA: Chocolate everywhere else is better than
in the United States.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.682
MATT: This is true, actually.

00:07:47.682 --> 00:07:49.441
TALIESIN: It's true. We have terrible chocolate.

00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:56.671
MARISHA: We have terrible chocolate because our
FDA standards <i>suck</i>. Holy shit. I have to go to

00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:58.682
take a picture and send this to Foster.

00:07:58.682 --> 00:08:02.724
TALIESIN: Casper, thank you so much. We will make
sure that the crew sees a teeny tiny amount of

00:08:02.724 --> 00:08:09.665
this. The smallest amount possible. Might just get
a photo. Thank you so much. And this is for Laura,

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:13.457
so I won't open it. I'll make sure this gets to
Laura. I'm going to put this in the Laura pile.

00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:16.125
MATT: Do it. So great.

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:18.874
TALIESIN: And I put everything away.

00:08:18.874 --> 00:08:22.893
MATT: Certainly. That is all candy. It is
delightful, delightful candy.

00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:24.856
TALIESIN: Oh, that is a lot of sugar.

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:25.723
MATT: Yes, it is.

00:08:25.723 --> 00:08:29.188
TALIESIN: This goes in another pile, and this goes
for the Laura pile.

00:08:29.188 --> 00:08:30.801
MATT: Everyone is walking away.

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.273
TALIESIN: Yeah. Everyone is walking away.

00:08:32.273 --> 00:08:35.493
MATT: Marisha, send the pictures quickly. We've
got to open more presents! All right, Taliesin.

00:08:35.493 --> 00:08:36.484
TALIESIN: I'll keep going.

00:08:36.484 --> 00:08:38.296
MATT: Keep going. We'll switch off in a second.

00:08:38.296 --> 00:08:46.419
TALIESIN: Hi, I'm going to move. Okay. I'm tense
about bleeding because I used the X-Acto knife the

00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:47.405
wrong way.

00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:50.734
MARISHA: It's fine. I have to do this now, or else
I'll forget.

00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:51.703
TALIESIN: That is true.

00:08:51.703 --> 00:08:56.370
MATT: Someone asked, "How often do you re-dye your
hair, Taliesin?"

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:03.925
TALIESIN: Not as often as I should, because I
don't mind it fading. That way also you can get

00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:07.918
new colors. So maybe every few months? And then
sometimes I'll just stop. I haven't stopped in a

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:09.634
while. But I'll probably--

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:10.722
MARISHA: You'll eventually stop.

00:09:10.722 --> 00:09:16.110
TALIESIN: I'll stop, and then I'll do it again.
It's always doing weird stuff. If you want to have

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.065
this kind of color and not dye it all the time,
they actually now make conditioners that have

00:09:20.065 --> 00:09:27.592
premixed hair dye in them, and it will stay
forever. It's nuts. You can do that.

00:09:28.092 --> 00:09:37.287
MATT: Oh, Tuk is in here, Yukira is in here. That
amazing, amazing manga pages they sent. That was amazing.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:45.866
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah! Erin Branch, this comes from,
is this Australia again? Yeah. Holy cow. Yeah,

00:09:45.866 --> 00:09:55.561
another one from Australia. Wow! Oh my god! I get
a feeling that this was a Christmas themed--

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.948
there's more strange candy.

00:09:57.948 --> 00:09:59.855
MATT: Critmas continues. Critmas carries on!

00:09:59.855 --> 00:10:05.485
TALIESIN: Oh dear. This is for you guys,
actually.

00:10:05.485 --> 00:10:06.787
MATT: What is that?

00:10:06.787 --> 00:10:10.795
MARISHA: Oh. Oh.

00:10:10.795 --> 00:10:12.916
TALIESIN: You have a box. You have a very personal
box.

00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:14.177
MARISHA: I like the box.

00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:17.082
TALIESIN: And a card, and I have something in this
stocking.

00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:19.925
MATT: People are requesting Dagon shortly.

00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:22.538
MARISHA: Dagon just took a bath. She's a wet
bird.

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.075
MATT: Yeah. Oh Tuk's in there.

00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:29.843
MATT, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Hi, Tuk!

00:10:29.843 --> 00:10:32.666
MATT: People are asking: Will I start making
players make pregnancy rolls?

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:35.667
ALL: No.

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:36.553
TALIESIN: Wow, no.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.679
MARISHA: Fuck that.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.657
TALIESIN: We have enough of that in real life.

00:10:38.657 --> 00:10:41.357
MARISHA: Right?

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:43.034
TALIESIN: I make that roll often enough as it is.

00:10:43.034 --> 00:10:45.174
MARISHA: Plus it's a magical fantasy land.

00:10:45.174 --> 00:10:49.093
TALIESIN: This is my escapism. This is not
Skyrim.

00:10:49.093 --> 00:10:50.952
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure they have
contraceptives.

00:10:50.952 --> 00:10:53.917
MATT and MARISHA: There's a cantrip for that.

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:58.350
TALIESIN: There's probably a really funny, good
cantrip for that.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.626
MATT: Exactly.

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:06.012
TALIESIN: There was that book. I'm trying to
remember the name of that book that you got Sam

00:11:06.012 --> 00:11:10.160
for his birthday. I wasn't the only one who got
Sam a weird book for his birthday.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.669
MATT: We got Sam the book on erotic roleplay.

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:14.090
MARISHA: Oh, this is from Tuk.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.555
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:11:14.555 --> 00:11:15.892
MATT and TALIESIN: Look at that timing!

00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:26.654
MARISHA: Yeah, Tuk! We got your box! I don't know
why I'm screaming it at you. "Congratulations on

00:11:26.654 --> 00:11:32.002
"your engagement! The box contains a small present
I think you will both appreciate. Wishing you a

00:11:32.002 --> 00:11:40.892
"Merry Aussie Christmas. Love, Tuk." Oh look at it.
It's an ostrich, a koala, a kangaroo, having a

00:11:40.892 --> 00:11:42.501
beach Christmas.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.866
MATT: That's beautiful.

00:11:43.866 --> 00:11:46.856
MARISHA: Okay, what's in here?

00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:53.555
MATT: If players ever in the story ever want to
introduce offspring, that's their choice. I don't

00:11:53.555 --> 00:11:55.811
want to make it a random roll for them.

00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:59.198
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:11:59.198 --> 00:12:01.366
MATT: What'd you get?

00:12:01.366 --> 00:12:04.005
MARISHA: I think she got us thyme.

00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:06.813
TALIESIN: Wow. Never enough, is there?

00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:08.582
MARISHA: There's never enough thyme.

00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:10.007
MATT: Aw, that's beautiful.

00:12:10.007 --> 00:12:11.633
MARISHA: It's a box of thyme.

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:13.328
TALIESIN: Oh, I love page poetry.

00:12:13.328 --> 00:12:14.712
MATT: That is fantastic.

00:12:14.712 --> 00:12:22.513
MARISHA: Aw, then she said, "Just kidding. This is
your real gift."

00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:28.863
MATT: You did buy us thyme, Tuk, and we appreciate
that. We need it.

00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:32.354
TALIESIN: A page of poetry, very nice. This is a
form that I am a fan of.

00:12:32.354 --> 00:12:33.909
MATT: Oh, is it?

00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:41.679
MARISHA: Oh, this is amazing. She made a donation
in honor of our engagement. Tuk, this is amazing.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:49.634
She gifted solar lights and school pencils through
the World Vision Association in Australia.

00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:50.842
MATT: That's amazing!

00:12:50.842 --> 00:12:54.399
MARISHA: "A gift of pencils means kids in poor
communities can write, draw, and dream their way

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.655
"to a brighter future. A gift of solar lights is a
clean and safe energy solution for families made

00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:07.291
"homeless by conflict or disaster." This is
amazing. Thank you so much, and as well as your

00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:10.954
gift of thyme, of all the time.

00:13:10.954 --> 00:13:12.669
MATT: It's so beautiful.

00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:19.766
MARISHA: That's amazing. I especially appreciate
this watch that says, "I believe in you!"

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:30.587
TALIESIN: I only saw the hour hand. It's
ridiculous. That's just ridiculous. Okay. I'll

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:35.285
make sure Liam gets his package. It's genius,
considering the weird stuff that comes from the

00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:36.987
mail. This was very smart.

00:13:36.987 --> 00:13:37.997
MATT: What is it?

00:13:37.997 --> 00:13:40.413
TALIESIN: Everything is in a plastic-sealed
envelope.

00:13:40.413 --> 00:13:41.779
MATT: That's pretty great, actually.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:48.093
TALIESIN: Really clever. Because things happen in
our mailbox. Things that should not. I'll make a

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.055
Liam pile.

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:59.438
MARISHA: This box smells like thyme. Box me.

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:03.027
MATT: People keep asking me how big your bath is
at home, Taliesin.

00:14:03.027 --> 00:14:09.167
TALIESIN: It's actually not the biggest bath on
earth, but it's comfortable. I don't have a hot

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:10.919
tub yet. I keep meaning to do that.

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:11.956
MATT: There you go.

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:15.160
TALIESIN: It's just such an event.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.782
MATT: People are going nuts over your hair,
Taliesin. They want the color.

00:14:17.782 --> 00:14:22.668
TALIESIN: Someday in the near future, everyone
will be able to do this no matter where you work.

00:14:22.668 --> 00:14:27.556
This is definitely a privilege of the job. It's a
big privilege of the job.

00:14:27.556 --> 00:14:34.589
MATT: All right, opening these presents. By the
way, guys, some of these boxes apparently got lost

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:40.436
in the chaos at the actual studio and have
recently been uncovered, so maybe a few packages

00:14:40.436 --> 00:14:44.403
here are being opened that should have been opened
a while back.

00:14:44.403 --> 00:14:48.973
TALIESIN: There have been some tectonic shifts.
We've discovered a lost temple of Crit Role mail.

00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:54.441
MARISHA: Brian might come by.

00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:55.884
MATT: Brian might come by? That'd be awesome!

00:14:55.884 --> 00:14:57.167
MARISHA: He's in Van Nuys, I guess.

00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:59.151
MATT: Dude, yeah! Let Brian come by and help open
some stuff.

00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:07.173
TALIESIN: I don't know, I just handed it to you. I
didn't really think things through. Boy, did I not

00:15:07.621 --> 00:15:09.729
think things through. How does this box work? I
don't understand.

00:15:09.729 --> 00:15:11.305
MARISHA: How does this box work?

00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:12.645
MATT: How does box work?

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:13.812
MARISHA: How do box work?

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:15.321
MATT: How. Does. Box. Work?

00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:16.806
TALIESIN: Like fucking magnets. Ah!

00:15:16.806 --> 00:15:18.919
MATT: Make an intelligence check, guys.

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.727
TALIESIN: That never ends well.

00:15:20.727 --> 00:15:21.341
MATT: Nope.

00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:28.311
TALIESIN: Where does this come from? Another one
from Australia! There's a lot from Australia.

00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:33.208
MARISHA: This is also from somewhere over the
pond.

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:35.450
TALIESIN: What! You're going to die.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.995
MARISHA: Candy! What is it?

00:15:36.995 --> 00:15:38.402
TALIESIN: You're going to die.

00:15:38.402 --> 00:15:39.240
MARISHA: What is it?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.769
TALIESIN: No, finish that and then we'll get to
this.

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:45.129
MARISHA: Is it Shiraz? I hope it's Shiraz.

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:47.435
MATT: It's from Australia, probably.

00:15:47.435 --> 00:15:49.480
TALIESIN: I'm not going to say anything yet.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:56.323
MARISHA: This is for Liam. This is Wispa. This has
got to be from--

00:15:56.323 --> 00:16:03.310
MATT: Aw, PuffGames is in here. That's awesome.
Got a box for Liam.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.314
MARISHA: This is for Matt.

00:16:05.314 --> 00:16:07.106
MATT: I got a thing.

00:16:07.106 --> 00:16:08.940
MARISHA: You get a thing.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.291
MATT: I got a thing.

00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:12.228
MARISHA: Who is this from?

00:16:12.228 --> 00:16:16.989
TALIESIN: I'm very excited about this one.

00:16:16.989 --> 00:16:21.533
MARISHA: Someone got us lots of candy.

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:23.888
MARISHA: We are going to be set on candy.

00:16:23.888 --> 00:16:28.246
TALIESIN: I was about to say, thank god we have
all the new hires over at work, so we can jump in

00:16:28.246 --> 00:16:29.473
a pile of candy.

00:16:29.473 --> 00:16:43.046
MARISHA: This is from Rebecca aka Vehlr. You know
this already. "You probably already know this, but

00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:48.232
"you guys are awesome. I came to the show quite
late. You guys were already beyond your 50th show

00:16:48.232 --> 00:17:02.147
"when the Critical Role wave hit me, so I got to
watch a lot of the unfolding." She goes on to talk

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.001
about how--

00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:06.328
TALIESIN: Take care you don't read into the
private things.

00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:14.070
MARISHA: I know. I want to make sure I'm not
doing. Her workmates got into the show and now

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:25.892
they want to start their own game. She said Liam's
one shot was very innovative for her.

00:17:25.892 --> 00:17:32.568
TALIESIN: It was okay. He did okay.

00:17:32.568 --> 00:17:37.994
MARISHA: "As I write this, you are no doubt
preparing for episode 72. The fans are wildly

00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:43.030
"theorizing, the artists are producing amazing
things for Inktober, and Taliesin is keeping it

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.264
"spooky on Twitter."

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:45.411
TALIESIN: (cackling)

00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:50.212
MARISHA: "Despite all my years of trolling the
internet, thanks to you I have been surprised by

00:17:50.212 --> 00:17:51.785
"how good a fandom can be."

00:17:51.785 --> 00:17:56.269
TALIESIN: Always nice to be the lighter side of
Twitter, isn't it?

00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:13.531
MARISHA: She doesn't say-- oh!

00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:15.344
MATT: This is Russian propaganda.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:20.929
MARISHA: Rebecca's the one that got the tattoo.

00:18:20.929 --> 00:18:23.044
MATT: Oh, really?

00:18:23.044 --> 00:18:30.429
MARISHA: Because she said her wrist is healing up.
"Turns out, my tattoo is in exactly the wrong

00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:32.365
place for typing."

00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:33.291
TALIESIN: Oh, ow.

00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:34.500
MATT: That'll do it.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:42.143
MARISHA: Oh shit. I don't know where these came
from. Thank you, Rebecca. That's amazing, we'll

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:46.233
make sure that Liam gets this, and then that's for
you.

00:18:46.233 --> 00:18:49.679
MATT: What am I opening? Are you going to turn
this around and I'll open it, and then we'll get

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.870
back to your awesome-

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.612
TALIESIN: Wait, you got a quick letter to read.
You do you, and then we'll do this one.

00:18:54.612 --> 00:18:55.222
MATT: Okay.

00:18:55.222 --> 00:19:01.339
TALIESIN: Actually, that'll be good. We can make
it a 360.

00:19:01.339 --> 00:19:11.504
MATT: That's awesome! Someone made me a custom
miniature of myself in a DM robe with a Tal'Dorei

00:19:11.504 --> 00:19:16.841
book, which is pretty freaking rad. That's
awesome. That's going in the office.

00:19:16.841 --> 00:19:21.295
TALIESIN: You would look good on a slab of cement
that you can carry around.

00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:24.224
MATT: I'll try and get one. It'll be great.
Marisha's currently dual wielding phones right

00:19:24.224 --> 00:19:26.305
now, so I'm going to duck down to get in the
frame.

00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:27.816
MARISHA: Nope. I got you, man.

00:19:27.816 --> 00:19:28.828
MATT: All right. Let's spin it around.

00:19:28.828 --> 00:19:30.425
TALIESIN: Here, if you want we can keep it--

00:19:30.425 --> 00:19:32.257
MATT: I think you should show Marisha what she
got.

00:19:32.257 --> 00:19:37.820
TALIESIN: Read your letter, and let me know when I
can hand you the thing.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.801
MARISHA: I love the seal. Fuck yeah, wax seal.

00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:41.331
MATT: Yes, I'm wearing my Periscope pants.

00:19:41.331 --> 00:19:51.645
MARISHA: Yeah. Periscope pants. Comfort pants. I
have to wear real pants far too often. Oh my god,

00:19:51.645 --> 00:20:04.030
crazy handwritten letters. Kat! Kat! This is from
Kat! It has to be Shiraz. "Dear Matt and Marisha,

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.464
"Firstly, thank you. I know you must hear it all
the time, but you are both such amazing,

00:20:07.464 --> 00:20:11.385
"inspirational people. I was lucky enough to meet
you both in person. It just made me admire and

00:20:11.385 --> 00:20:16.339
"respect you more. Critical Role has been a great
source of inspiration for me, and like many other

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:20.856
"Critters and Critical Role artists, this got me
back in a steady creative headspace each week.

00:20:20.856 --> 00:20:27.185
"There is always something new and inspiring to
create and form." She goes on to talk about her

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:37.586
artistic drive: "Watching Critical Role--" Once
again, I don't want to say anything that is too

00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:44.809
personal. "Anyway, I'm sure by now you know how
awesome you both are. No need me for me to keep

00:20:44.809 --> 00:20:51.454
"reminding you. I wanted to share some wine with
the wine speaker and vendor herself. Please enjoy

00:20:51.454 --> 00:21:07.734
"the Ashari brew from the Fire Plane of Australia.
Much love, Kat." What the fuck! What?! You see that?!

00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:09.587
MATT: Ashari Shiraz.

00:21:09.587 --> 00:21:12.533
MARISHA: Which is sexy sounding.

00:21:12.533 --> 00:21:15.673
ALL: Ashari Shiraz.

00:21:15.673 --> 00:21:17.089
MATT: That sounds like a Batman villain.

00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:19.279
TALIESIN: It sounds like something hard to say
after a bottle of it.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:23.951
MARISHA: That sounds like something we would try
to get Patrick Rothfuss-- hey, Patrick Rothfuss.

00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:29.721
Ashari Shiraz. Ashari Shiraz. Ashari Shiraz. That
wasn't too bad

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.712
MATT: It's pretty great.

00:21:31.712 --> 00:21:34.476
TALIESIN: What was it? "An Irish wristwatch."

00:21:34.476 --> 00:21:36.052
MARISHA: Irish wristwatch.

00:21:36.052 --> 00:21:39.721
TALIESIN: An Irish wristwatch. That's very hard to
say.

00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:51.061
MARISHA: Wow, this is insane. It's all the way
down. I don't even-- wow. "Local knowledge of the

00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:57.400
"volcanic earth has helped us to select the prime
goodberries of the Shiraz variety. Across the vast

"bending techniques, result in a pure druidic

"the culture of farming, food, wine, and community
for hundreds of generations. Our commitment to the

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:32.956
"Wine of the Ashari contains sulfur."

00:22:32.956 --> 00:22:39.092
TALIESIN: There'll be wine druid, will be a
subclass coming soon.

00:22:39.092 --> 00:22:44.969
MARISHA: I feel like I should open it. Jesus shit.
This is amazing!

00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:48.372
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's amazing

00:22:48.372 --> 00:22:49.974
MARISHA: Kat, you're ridiculous.

00:22:49.974 --> 00:22:52.491
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:56.469
MATT: Exactly. All right, we got a lot of stuff to
get through.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:08.102
TALIESIN: I got a letter from Les Crystalstarry, I
want to say? She apparently felt the urge to pick

00:23:08.102 --> 00:23:15.613
up her calligraphy pen again and sent me-- I
actually know this song. It's the lyrics to the

00:23:15.613 --> 00:23:23.807
song "The Parting Glass." I am a bit of a singer
when I get drunk. This is the inevitable Irish

00:23:23.807 --> 00:23:30.231
wake song. I used to actually sing it with my
historical recreationist friends every Memorial

00:23:30.231 --> 00:23:36.780
Day, and it's a very tearful song. I can see how
nearly dying would inspire this. Thank you so

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.786
much! At some point, I'll probably end up singing
this on Geek & Sundry when we have a really bad

00:23:41.786 --> 00:23:47.981
day. Probably a little liquored up. Thank you so
much. This is fantastic.

00:23:47.981 --> 00:23:53.465
MARISHA: That's a very positive inducing gift.
I'll try and move faster.

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:57.299
TALIESIN: I'll try to not cut myself.

00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:58.186
MARISHA: Same.

00:24:04.435 --> 00:24:09.436
MATT: (singing) Opening the box, the box getting
open. That's my new--

00:24:09.436 --> 00:24:12.121
TALIESIN and MATT: What's in the box?

00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:22.236
MARISHA: This is from Anna Krezowski.

00:24:22.236 --> 00:24:24.879
TALIESIN: From where?

00:24:24.879 --> 00:24:27.775
MARISHA: From Maine?

00:24:27.775 --> 00:24:36.865
TALIESIN: MA is Maine, not Massachusetts. I always
forget which one is which. Now I have the

00:24:36.865 --> 00:24:38.741
Massachusetts song stuck in my head.

00:24:38.741 --> 00:24:45.036
MARISHA: (grunting)

00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:45.902
TALIESIN: You're doing great.

00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:47.276
MATT: You can do it.

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:51.251
TALIESIN: One of us is going to cut themselves
eventually.

00:24:51.251 --> 00:24:55.797
MARISHA: Don't say that like it's probably going
to happen.

00:24:55.797 --> 00:24:58.397
TALIESIN: I know us in real life.

00:25:04.142 --> 00:25:11.622
MARISHA: This is not a gift.

00:25:11.622 --> 00:25:17.566
TALIESIN: Oh, this is something that I was sent
that we have to deal with. Carry on. Here, have a

00:25:17.972 --> 00:25:22.056
gift, or something else with a label. We don't
actually sort this mail beforehand. We should

00:25:22.056 --> 00:25:22.910
probably do that.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.355
MARISHA: Well, we used to.

00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:27.399
TALIESIN: Every now and then, they're like, "What
happened to those light bulbs?"

00:25:30.813 --> 00:25:36.750
MARISHA: That's true. Ooh, what is these?

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.749
TALIESIN: From Brittany Whetland--

00:25:47.632 --> 00:25:48.737
MATT: From Brittany Whetland, you said?

00:25:48.737 --> 00:25:56.671
TALIESIN: Yeah, she has a Dungeons & Dragons group
of her own. I don't blame you; I stopped DMing for

00:25:56.671 --> 00:25:58.635
a reason as well. Oh god.

00:25:58.635 --> 00:26:03.472
MATT: Nothing wrong with saying hi from Virginia,
by the way. Virginia's awesome.

00:26:03.472 --> 00:26:05.410
MARISHA: Meghan LeVaughn.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:15.144
TALIESIN: Wow! That's fantastic. That's a really
good title. All right, and apparently-- Oh, wow!

00:26:15.144 --> 00:26:22.106
MARISHA: Meghan got me a Pac-Man dress.

00:26:22.106 --> 00:26:23.371
MATT: Oh, that's so cute!

00:26:23.371 --> 00:26:28.853
MARISHA: Isn't that so cute? I actually have
Pac-Man leggings that these will totally go with.

00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:29.792
TALIESIN: I forgot about that.

00:26:29.792 --> 00:26:40.582
MARISHA: Yeah! That's pretty adorable. Oh, Meghan!
You spoil us too much. So cute, thank you!

00:26:40.582 --> 00:26:44.139
TALIESIN: Oh yes, the carrot cake! This is
apparently handmade.

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:45.981
MATT: What is? What?!

00:26:45.981 --> 00:26:49.426
TALIESIN: It's a rug.

00:26:49.426 --> 00:26:50.281
MARISHA: Shut up!

00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:53.419
MATT: No way! That's nuts! What?!

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:56.736
MARISHA: Where should we put that?

00:26:56.736 --> 00:27:02.137
TALIESIN: I don't know. We have to think about it.
We have to have some discussion.

00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:06.049
MARISHA: We were wanting more rugs for the
office.

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:12.189
TALIESIN: You were wanting more rugs for the
office. I don't want anybody to step on this, though.

00:27:12.189 --> 00:27:14.616
MARISHA: We could also use that on the Talks
Machina set.

00:27:14.616 --> 00:27:16.502
TALIESIN: It could be on the Talks Machina set.
That's true.

00:27:16.502 --> 00:27:18.874
MATT: That looks incredible. That's going to find
some happy use.

00:27:18.874 --> 00:27:20.500
MARISHA: Oh my goodness gracious.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:20.969
TALIESIN: That's nuts.

00:27:20.969 --> 00:27:27.268
MARISHA: That's so awesome! Dude, that's nuts. You
guys!

00:27:27.268 --> 00:27:29.310
TALIESIN: Thank you so much.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.577
MARISHA: Do you want me to take over, Matt?

00:27:31.577 --> 00:27:41.020
MATT: Sure, we'll swap out. (singing) Take hold of
the camera, say hi to the chatroom. All right, let

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:54.450
me grab some things to carry over. I'm going to
grab these boxes here. Hi everyone! Let's grab

00:27:54.450 --> 00:28:02.938
this. This one is from Troy Pensclose from
Stratford, who sent--

00:28:02.938 --> 00:28:05.531
MARISHA: Hi, everybody. How you doing?

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.783
MATT: "Matt, Marisha, Liam, Taliesin, and whoever
wants them. Enclosed are two copies of Tome of

00:28:16.783 --> 00:28:23.804
"Potioncraft for their creation and use. My hope is
that this may aid Keyleth in her potion crafting

00:28:23.804 --> 00:28:28.427
"exploits, if only as a source of inspiration for
Matt's creativity. There will be a companion tome

00:28:28.427 --> 00:28:32.478
"on poison showing up sometime in 2017 as well, as
soon as the Kickstarter finally ships.

00:28:32.478 --> 00:28:36.670
MARISHA: That is what I want in my life.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.726
MATT: I think you want this one.

00:28:38.726 --> 00:28:39.592
TALIESIN: I'm down.

00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:41.798
MATT: I think this one will be shared between me
and Marisha.

00:28:41.798 --> 00:28:45.550
MARISHA: Yes, because I am the alchemist of the
group.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.518
MATT: Yeah, you are. That's so awesome.

00:28:49.518 --> 00:28:56.460
MARISHA: That I really need to get back to
focusing on. We haven't really had time, let's be honest.

00:28:56.959 --> 00:29:03.151
TALIESIN: We have some beautiful art from Amelia
Rett from Portland, Oregon.

00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:07.522
MARISHA: Oh my goodness!

00:29:07.522 --> 00:29:09.669
MATT: Great coloring.

00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:13.073
TALIESIN: Fabulous. There's letters on the back.
This is Pike and Vex over here and this is

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:17.376
Keyleth. There's letters on the back that we will
read at some point.

00:29:17.376 --> 00:29:20.383
MARISHA: Those are amazing!

00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:23.448
MATT: That's fantastic.

00:29:23.448 --> 00:29:25.081
TALIESIN: Oh, and there's a letter.

00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:47.629
MATT: That's awesome. This is from Teffany Mae
Malone. Get off me, paper. It says, "Dear Ashley,

00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:53.187
"Laura, Liam, Marisha, Matt, Sam, Taliesin, Travis,
Shortly after my last package with the knitted

00:29:53.187 --> 00:29:54.660
"fingerless gloves and scarves--"

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.418
MARISHA: Which was amazing, and we've both been
wearing those fingerless gloves like crazy.

00:29:59.418 --> 00:30:02.862
MATT: "I learned a new knitting technique. It
didn't take me long to come upon the idea that if

00:30:02.862 --> 00:30:05.183
"anyone you all would appreciate some dragonscale
gloves."

00:30:05.183 --> 00:30:13.260
MARISHA: That's right! She mentioned this online.
No, when we saw her.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:21.400
MATT: Wow, she made two pairs symbolizing each of
the dragons in the conclave: a smaller pair and a

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.831
larger pair to accommodate those with smaller and
larger hands. That's so cool. "There are ten pairs

00:30:25.831 --> 00:30:29.086
"included and only eight of you, so feel free to do
whatever you wish with the extra two pairs: You

00:30:29.086 --> 00:30:31.647
"can keep them, gift them, donate them for a
giveaway, sell them, whatever you want."

00:30:31.647 --> 00:30:36.855
MARISHA: Well, we're not going to sell them.
That's not a thing you do.

00:30:36.855 --> 00:30:59.403
MATT: Wow, Teffany. Oh, what! Like, yeah, like.
Holy shit. So that's, Umbrasyl, Raishan.

00:30:59.403 --> 00:31:06.190
MARISHA: Well, I feel like I need a pair because
of Raishan, because I am going to be wearing that

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.457
bitch very soon.

00:31:07.457 --> 00:31:12.084
MATT: Brimscythe and Vorugal. That's so freaking
cool.

00:31:12.084 --> 00:31:17.831
TALIESIN: I can't even. They feel really nice.

00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:19.137
MARISHA: Put them on!

00:31:19.137 --> 00:31:20.547
TALIESIN: Hold on.

00:31:20.547 --> 00:31:24.944
MATT: I'm going to put a pair on, too.

00:31:24.944 --> 00:31:29.011
TALIESIN: Sounds like the song they play when they
quit sugar on the catering show.

00:31:29.011 --> 00:31:30.832
MATT: It kind of does, actually.

00:31:30.832 --> 00:31:33.391
MARISHA: Hey Matt would you do me a favor?

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:34.019
MATT: What?

00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:36.984
MARISHA: Would you scooch a foot closer to
Taliesin.

00:31:36.984 --> 00:31:40.704
MATT: Are you trying to get us both in one shot?
That's fruitless, but sure.

00:31:40.704 --> 00:31:44.512
MARISHA: No, that's better. It's better. It's
good.

00:31:44.512 --> 00:31:49.879
TALIESIN: I'm more or less buried. Oh my god.

00:31:49.879 --> 00:31:56.538
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes!

00:31:56.538 --> 00:32:00.383
MATT: See that's what you want to do.

00:32:00.383 --> 00:32:08.612
TALIESIN: Oh shit. Oh shit, son. I feel like a
problem.

00:32:08.612 --> 00:32:12.044
MARISHA: I feel like those are going to Burning
Man with us.

00:32:12.044 --> 00:32:15.543
MATT: Oh yeah.This is so freaking cool.

00:32:15.543 --> 00:32:20.312
TALIESIN: We are going ice skating next week.
Let's go down to Pershing Square and start some

00:32:20.312 --> 00:32:21.524
shit.

00:32:21.524 --> 00:32:26.977
MATT: Tiffany, these are amazing. Thank you so
much!

00:32:26.977 --> 00:32:32.862
TALIESIN: They feel slick. Holy cow.

00:32:32.862 --> 00:32:33.838
MATT: What did you open?

00:32:33.838 --> 00:32:38.629
TALIESIN: I don't know I was distracted by-- If
you need more, I can give you more.

00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:41.336
MATT: We are keeping letters in an area so we
don't lose them.

00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:43.524
TALIESIN: This goes with this. I was reading
this.

00:32:43.524 --> 00:32:45.816
MATT: Should I keep it all organized?

00:32:45.816 --> 00:32:55.870
TALIESIN: This is from Mayfly. These are
individual packages so we will distribute them. We

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.092
can do ours right now.

00:32:57.092 --> 00:32:58.541
MATT: I am going to keep my Thordak gloves.

00:32:58.541 --> 00:33:00.367
MARISHA: People said you guys look like
wrestlers.

00:33:00.367 --> 00:33:04.212
TALIESIN: That's for Travis.

00:33:04.212 --> 00:33:08.225
MATT: You ever do the Mortal Kombat versus
screens? Du-du-dun.

00:33:08.225 --> 00:33:15.362
TALIESIN: Oh God. Wait, and Marisha. Here you go.
That's how you toss it.

00:33:15.362 --> 00:33:20.731
MATT: Inside this bag is a single yellow six-sided
die.

00:33:20.731 --> 00:33:29.819
MARISHA: Inside mine is a green six sided die.

00:33:29.819 --> 00:33:36.108
TALIESIN: There is a story to this we will have
to-- I love the paper too.

00:33:36.108 --> 00:33:43.101
MATT: It's from Jack. @mayflydecember

00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:44.650
MATT and TALIESIN: Thank you, Jack.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.578
TALIESIN: Will will distribute these and the story
to everybody when we see them.

00:33:47.578 --> 00:33:51.284
MATT: That's awesome.

00:33:51.284 --> 00:34:01.646
TALIESIN: Open. Oh yes.

00:34:01.646 --> 00:34:05.577
MATT: Hence dice bags. That's so awesome, thank
you so much for the dice bags. That's fantastic.

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:10.792
TALIESIN: I have been needing-- well I have a
little project, but we won't get into that. I

00:34:10.792 --> 00:34:13.808
shouldn't talk about that yet, it's a whole thing.
There's a project.

00:34:13.808 --> 00:34:15.408
MATT: There's always a project.

00:34:15.408 --> 00:34:18.380
TALIESIN: We are kind of project people.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.876
MATT: This is true.

00:34:19.876 --> 00:34:21.194
TALIESIN: Where did the letter go?

00:34:21.194 --> 00:34:23.005
MATT: I put the letter over here.

00:34:23.005 --> 00:34:26.510
TALIESIN: Put the letter with the bags so we
know.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.134
MATT: Cool.

00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:29.329
TALIESIN: I'll go and get more.

00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:39.807
MATT: Opening this. This is Games & Gear DLB.
"Dear Matt and Critical Role. Thanks for providing

00:34:39.807 --> 00:34:45.201
"our office with hours of entertainment on a weekly
basis. Please accept these brushes as a small

00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:48.316
"token of our appreciation. I hope they give you as
many hours of enjoyment painting your miniatures

00:34:48.316 --> 00:34:50.688
"as you have given us listening to the adventures
of Vox Machina." What?!

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:51.327
MARISHA: Oh wow.

00:34:51.327 --> 00:34:55.798
MATT: "Perhaps we may see some finished miniatures
in the show in the future. Good work, guys. We all

00:34:55.798 --> 00:35:00.901
"love the awesome show. We wish you all a very
happy holidays and a very merry Critmas and an

00:35:00.901 --> 00:35:06.946
"exceptionally happy new year. Best wishes, the
Games & Gears Crew." They have sent an incredibly

00:35:06.946 --> 00:35:12.931
legit collection of miniature painting brushes,
which I'm already getting--

00:35:12.931 --> 00:35:15.912
TALIESIN: I can already feel you being sad that
you haven't used.

00:35:15.912 --> 00:35:23.112
MATT: I painted the recent Gilmore and Allura
figures, but those are with my old brushes. These

00:35:23.112 --> 00:35:26.675
look awesome! They have a leather case in them?!
Oh shit!

00:35:26.675 --> 00:35:31.616
TALIESIN: We used to have painting days. Those
were the good--

00:35:31.616 --> 00:35:33.224
MATT: I know, back when we had time.

00:35:33.224 --> 00:35:34.932
TALIESIN: Back when there was time. I remember.

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:38.506
MATT: Look at this! These brushes have leather
cases on them!

00:35:38.506 --> 00:35:40.208
MARISHA: Those are really nice!

00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:41.663
MATT: Like, what the--

00:35:41.663 --> 00:35:42.889
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:35:42.889 --> 00:35:46.331
TALIESIN: That's kind of intense. You could kill a
man with those.

00:35:46.331 --> 00:35:54.846
MATT: I <i>will</i> kill a man with those. These are so
cool! Thank you, guys! Merry Critmas! Holy shit!

00:35:54.846 --> 00:35:58.729
TALIESIN: There's no return address. That's-- oh.

00:35:58.729 --> 00:35:59.938
MATT: That's so cool!

00:35:59.938 --> 00:36:02.901
TALIESIN and MATT: From Chris?

00:36:02.901 --> 00:36:08.964
TALIESIN: Of Bearsibel? Bearsabul? Bearsabub? I'm
going to go with Bearsabub. Sure. For Liam that we

00:36:08.964 --> 00:36:10.140
we will save for later.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.361
MARISHA: Beazibub?

00:36:11.361 --> 00:36:30.459
TALIESIN: Beazibub. As I open very slowly. What?!
Yeah!

00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:32.173
MATT: "I find your lack of crits disturbing."

00:36:32.173 --> 00:36:36.955
TALIESIN: I think this is a commentary on my last
few games. I've broken this now, just putting it

00:36:36.955 --> 00:36:43.726
out there. I've broken the bad streak. This is
awesome. Thank you! Thank you for the black

00:36:43.726 --> 00:36:46.176
t-shirts. I'm always a fan of a black t-shirt.

00:36:46.176 --> 00:36:52.185
MATT: I'm going to try not to butcher this. This
is from Elaine Kavagnan. Kavaganan?

00:36:52.693 --> 00:37:00.048
TALIESIN: Dude, thank you so much! I'll make sure
Liam gets his.

00:37:00.048 --> 00:37:13.846
MATT: Here is a-- ooh, it's an actual wrapped
present! That's nice! Here are cards. Inside the

00:37:13.846 --> 00:37:24.819
cards-- I don't know why I'm talking like Mrs.
Doubtfire. Oh whoa! Elaine-- is a

00:37:24.819 --> 00:37:30.554
work-in-progress. It's a scarf for Pike with
Sarenrae on it and everything. It's a picture of

00:37:30.554 --> 00:37:34.892
it. That's in-process. "Especially at Critmas,"
Christmas. I keep wanting to say Critmas time.

00:37:34.892 --> 00:37:40.100
"Especially a Christmas time, it's the thought
that counts." And then the pop-up goes, "Great!"

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:46.022
It says, "Hi guys, Love you all at Critical Role
so much! I'll never forget that day I randomly

00:37:46.022 --> 00:37:49.936
"clicked on a random YouTube video for episode one.
It's been one hell of a ride. Hoping that ride

00:37:49.936 --> 00:37:53.915
"will continue for a long time. I knit and crochet
when my anxiety gets really bad, so I wanted to

00:37:53.915 --> 00:37:58.366
"make something for you all to show my appreciation
for the show, for all you do. In this package is a

00:37:58.366 --> 00:38:03.431
"shawl for Vex. It took me a long time to find the
perfect yarn that would fit her color scheme. I'm

00:38:03.431 --> 00:38:08.855
"working on stuff for the rest of the cast. Sorry,
I'm really slow." Don't apologize. You guys are

00:38:08.855 --> 00:38:17.278
ridiculous. "I really hope you like it. Happy
Holidays! From, Your Fan Elaine. P.S. I'm working

00:38:17.278 --> 00:38:26.064
"on a scarf for Pike, which is pictured there."
That's so cool! Holy shit. Should we hold off on

00:38:26.064 --> 00:38:27.351
this and let Laura open it?

00:38:27.351 --> 00:38:28.855
TALIESIN: Yeah. We should hold off and let Laura
open it.

00:38:28.855 --> 00:38:30.870
MATT: All right, we'll let Laura open this. Thank
you so much!

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.478
TALIESIN: I have a pile with your name on it over
here.

00:38:32.478 --> 00:38:33.191
MATT: Oh no.

00:38:33.191 --> 00:38:38.285
TALIESIN: I will open things that have other names
on them.

00:38:38.285 --> 00:38:42.131
MARISHA: I really want some candy.

00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:43.494
TALIESIN: More candy?

00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:47.527
MARISHA: I haven't eaten any candy yet.

00:38:47.527 --> 00:38:49.934
TALIESIN: This is for Travis.

00:38:49.934 --> 00:38:51.615
MARISHA: I want to eat candy.

00:38:51.615 --> 00:39:00.521
TALIESIN: Oh shit. That's highly entertaining.
I'll make sure that Travis sees that.

00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:01.826
MATT: Who's it from?

00:39:01.826 --> 00:39:11.194
TALIESIN: It's from Terry in Illinois. Terry in
Illinois, we'll make sure that-- I'm trying not to

00:39:11.194 --> 00:39:14.270
read last names A. Because it seems [inaudible],
and B. Because I can't. I'm terrible.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:15.483
MATT: Fair enough.

00:39:15.483 --> 00:39:21.400
TALIESIN: I'll make sure this package gets to
Travis. I'm calling that his pile now.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:29.172
MATT: This package is from Merritt Polai? Polay?

00:39:29.172 --> 00:39:34.922
TALIESIN: Ooh, this came from far away!

00:39:34.922 --> 00:39:36.220
MARISHA: That's a very pink--

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.094
MATT: This is for you.

00:39:37.094 --> 00:39:39.026
TALIESIN: Wow, that's really pink!

00:39:39.026 --> 00:39:40.605
MATT: Got presents here for Sam.

00:39:40.605 --> 00:39:44.299
MARISHA: It's so pink! It matches your hair!

00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:46.918
MATT: Death Wish Coffee for the Pit Crew.

00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:48.400
TALIESIN: Oh, Death Wish is great!

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.643
MARISHA: Nice! What is it?

00:39:52.643 --> 00:39:55.391
TALIESIN: I don't know. I was just missing-- I
used to have a pair of swimming trunks that were

00:39:55.391 --> 00:39:56.005
this color.

00:39:56.005 --> 00:40:03.411
MARISHA: Open it! I want to know what's in the
fluorescent pink package! Oh, Matt, turn around

00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:10.405
the mug. Turn around the mug. Did you see? It has
an insignia on it.

00:40:10.405 --> 00:40:11.612
TALIESIN: He's doing a thing to it.

00:40:11.612 --> 00:40:14.305
MARISHA: Did you see the insignia on it?

00:40:14.305 --> 00:40:16.056
MATT: Yeah! I saw it.

00:40:16.056 --> 00:40:19.755
MARISHA: Sorry, I was distracted by the
fluorescent pink.

00:40:19.755 --> 00:40:20.907
MATT: Yeah, it'll do that.

00:40:20.907 --> 00:40:22.999
TALIESIN: What? What is this?

00:40:22.999 --> 00:40:31.236
MATT: Wild cherry tea. I got awesome gifts here to
distribute to the cast. Thank you so much! I think

00:40:31.236 --> 00:40:33.413
I'll go fill that in a little bit, actually.

00:40:33.413 --> 00:40:35.658
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

00:40:35.658 --> 00:40:44.238
MARISHA: What is it? They're vials of color. Why
are there vials of color?

00:40:55.748 --> 00:41:06.197
TALIESIN: (laughs) Oh wow. It's ink and I believe
some nail color. This is some very colorful nail

00:41:06.504 --> 00:41:09.551
color. Yes, it will get used.

00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:11.302
MARISHA: Wait, what's the ink for?

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.455
TALIESIN: It's pen ink.

00:41:12.455 --> 00:41:13.035
MARISHA: Really?

00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:22.200
TALIESIN: Believe so. Yep, this is pen ink. It's
some really intense, multicolor pen ink.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.072
MARISHA: That's awesome.

00:41:25.072 --> 00:41:27.715
TALIESIN: That works out well with other things
that happened this weekend.

00:41:27.715 --> 00:41:31.686
MARISHA: Would that work with that glass pen?

00:41:31.686 --> 00:41:33.482
TALIESIN: No.

00:41:33.482 --> 00:41:41.341
MATT: More in order from Eddie Chandler? Guy who
sent the Talks Machina thing earlier. The shot glass?

00:41:41.341 --> 00:41:44.315
MARISHA: Oh, he sent more?

00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:46.024
MATT: Apparently.

00:41:46.024 --> 00:41:52.074
TALIESIN: Thank you very much, this will get used
for something awesome. I'm going to put the bag,

00:41:52.456 --> 00:41:53.751
because I actually like the package a lot.

00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:58.488
MARISHA: Pile of candy! Just tempting me!

00:41:58.488 --> 00:42:05.608
MATT: Whoa. "Dear Critical Role, I found your show
a couple months ago and spent my evenings watching

00:42:05.608 --> 00:42:13.310
"all the episodes to get caught up. Who needs real
life?" I feel you on that. "Thank you for giving

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:17.349
"us such a great show in its depth of creativity
and vibrance provided by an awesome GM, coupled

00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:22.122
"with the rest of you adding your intensities and
emotions to characters. One of the early episodes,

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:25.116
"in the Critmas section in the end, somebody had
sent you a bottle of libation. Also during the

00:42:25.116 --> 00:42:28.086
battle in Cloak and Dagger, Taliesin was saying he
needed a drink, and at the end of that episode,

00:42:28.086 --> 00:42:31.836
Laura was saying you all should go get drinks
because Percy had died. To that end, I'm sending a

00:42:31.836 --> 00:42:35.718
two-part gift, one with this note, and the other
coming from overseas. Hopefully they arrive within

00:42:35.718 --> 00:42:39.029
a short time of each other. If the drink arrives
before these, it's a bottle of Royal Dragon

00:42:39.029 --> 00:42:43.309
vodka." Which, it did arrive and we haven't opened
yet because we were waiting for a specific event.

00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:48.773
MARISHA: That arrived. That's in the kitchen right
now. We were told we couldn't open it until we'd

00:42:48.773 --> 00:42:55.509
killed all the dragons, so as soon as diseased
bitchy-bitch is--

00:42:55.509 --> 00:42:57.730
MATT: Diseased Bitchy-Bitch is now her official
title.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:06.277
MARISHA: --dead, then we can, you know. Sick!

00:43:06.277 --> 00:43:08.279
MATT: It's a whole box of Critical Role shot
glasses.

00:43:08.279 --> 00:43:14.885
MATT: Thank you, Eddie! Our livers cry in
anticipation. Pardon me.

00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:16.774
MARISHA: Just like that?

00:43:16.774 --> 00:43:21.745
MATT: That's fantastic. I'll be sure to save the
letter for the others.

00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:22.917
MARISHA: Hells yes.

00:43:22.917 --> 00:43:30.880
MATT: Thank you so much, Eddie. Those will go to
use, don't worry.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:41.019
TALIESIN: This is one of those letters to save for
later. Roadmouse from Poland, we got your letter,

00:43:41.468 --> 00:43:42.909
and the mouse is adorable.

00:43:42.909 --> 00:43:52.882
MATT: Hi, Roadmouse! This is from Japan.

00:43:52.882 --> 00:43:54.318
TALIESIN: Thank you, Roadmouse.

00:43:54.318 --> 00:43:56.418
MATT: This is a package from Japan!

00:43:56.418 --> 00:44:00.308
MARISHA: It came from the other side of the
world!

00:44:00.308 --> 00:44:04.078
TALIESIN: We've got Poland and Japan right now.

00:44:04.078 --> 00:44:06.327
MATT: Marisha, you know how you wanted more
candy?

00:44:06.327 --> 00:44:06.884
MARISHA: Oh!

00:44:06.884 --> 00:44:10.311
MATT: Now you get a bunch of Japanese candy.

00:44:10.311 --> 00:44:13.636
MARISHA: Australian candy and Japanese candy?

00:44:13.636 --> 00:44:15.948
MATT: Candy from around the world!

00:44:15.948 --> 00:44:18.215
MARISHA: Oh, man, it's the best!

00:44:18.215 --> 00:44:21.412
MATT: It's cider candies? What?!

00:44:21.412 --> 00:44:23.276
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, those are great, I love those.

00:44:23.276 --> 00:44:24.556
MARISHA: What are they? Cyber?

00:44:24.556 --> 00:44:28.904
TALIESIN: They've got a fizzy thing to them. You
know those like--

00:44:28.904 --> 00:44:30.121
(knocking)

00:44:30.121 --> 00:44:33.468
TALIESIN: Oh, god! No! No!

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:40.204
(laughter)

00:44:40.204 --> 00:44:41.186
MARISHA: I don't know, man!

00:44:41.186 --> 00:44:42.494
MATT: It's unlocked, Brian!

00:44:45.834 --> 00:44:47.288
BRIAN: Are we on the Internet?

00:44:49.598 --> 00:44:51.134
MATT: We got dragon scales.

00:44:51.134 --> 00:44:51.871
BRIAN: What?!

00:44:51.871 --> 00:44:53.156
MATT: I know, what the shit?

00:44:53.156 --> 00:44:54.401
MARISHA: Brian Foster, everybody.

00:44:54.401 --> 00:44:57.061
BRIAN and MARISHA: Look at all the candy!

00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:58.631
MATT: Did you see the shot glasses you got?

00:44:58.631 --> 00:45:00.965
BRIAN: Dude, let me see this. Hi, guys!

00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:04.144
MARISHA: They're all saying, "Brian, yes!"

00:45:04.144 --> 00:45:06.693
BRIAN: I was down the street at Paper Heroes.

00:45:06.693 --> 00:45:07.610
MARISHA: Oh really?

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.045
TALIESIN: They're having a--

00:45:09.045 --> 00:45:10.523
BRIAN: Yeah, check it out!

00:45:10.523 --> 00:45:12.841
MARISHA: Did they hang up our poster?

00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:14.573
TALIESIN: I don't know if they hung up our
poster.

00:45:14.573 --> 00:45:24.351
BRIAN: No, Faux, F-A-U-X, he said to tell you guys
they haven't found a frame big enough for it yet.

00:45:24.351 --> 00:45:30.064
He was so worried, he's like, "Tell Matt if he
comes in and he doesn't see it, it's because we're

00:45:30.064 --> 00:45:30.995
"trying to find--"

00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:33.077
MATT: Dude! It's not an expectation; I was happy
to give it for them.

00:45:33.077 --> 00:45:36.403
BRIAN: I told him that you would be sorely
disappointed and you would never shop there again.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.170
MATT: You're such an asshole.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.215
TALIESIN: One of our favorite breakfast places
used to have an amazing toy store next door and

00:45:41.215 --> 00:45:44.084
they closed and we're very sad. Then a game store
opened and we were kind of happy.

00:45:44.084 --> 00:45:45.981
BRIAN: That's cool. That's where that place is?

00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:48.441
MARISHA: Yeah, it used to be a big kid toy store.

00:45:48.441 --> 00:45:49.760
BRIAN: This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.401
MARISHA: Right?

00:45:50.401 --> 00:45:51.646
MATT: Yeah, dude.

00:45:51.646 --> 00:45:53.810
BRIAN: Fill this with Goldschläger at once.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.331
MATT: That's a terrible idea.

00:45:56.331 --> 00:45:58.345
BRIAN: I love that your guys' Christmas tree is
still up.

00:45:58.345 --> 00:45:59.835
MARISHA: Yeah, look, man.

00:45:59.835 --> 00:46:05.581
MATT: I can guarantee you, it's obviously a
conscious decision. This delightful box of

00:46:05.915 --> 00:46:13.249
Japanese gifts came with a letter. "You guys have
kept me through some of the biggest changes in my

00:46:13.249 --> 00:46:17.896
"life over the past year, and they have both
terrible, wonderful, and nowhere in-between. So I

00:46:17.896 --> 00:46:22.058
"thought I'd return the favor. I made these boxes
on that theme, terrible and wonderful, along with

00:46:22.058 --> 00:46:25.816
"some things that can only be found on my island. I
hope they bring you a few moments of joy in the

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:30.432
"midst of stress as you all have done so often for
me. Word of advice, don't trust it if it's cute.

00:46:30.432 --> 00:46:37.568
"From Haz, aka tinyfierce. P.S. I actually started
GMing again thanks to you, Matt." Awesome. "P.P.S.

00:46:37.568 --> 00:46:39.589
"But tell Taliesin that he's my favorite, thanks."

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:40.285
BRIAN: What?!

00:46:40.285 --> 00:46:41.092
TALIESIN: I know, it's cool.

00:46:41.092 --> 00:46:42.943
MARISHA: Yeah, we all know that.

00:46:42.943 --> 00:46:50.486
BRIAN: Another one of those, "Taliesin is my
favorite" people? That's cool. He's mine, too.

00:46:50.486 --> 00:46:51.391
TALIESIN: I have a cult.

00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:52.716
MARISHA: You do have a cult.

00:46:52.716 --> 00:46:54.545
MATT: Fashion candies.

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:56.776
MARISHA: What?!

00:46:56.776 --> 00:46:59.367
MATT: I don't know! But we have a box of them!

00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:02.234
MARISHA: Fashion candies?

00:47:02.234 --> 00:47:13.160
TALIESIN: Wait, I've got to read really quickly.
This is from Steph_Smo, stickynotesfromparis. It's

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:18.211
a picture of her puppy, who is adorable. Oh my
god! That's the end of me with a Darth Vader--

00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:21.631
MATT: Marisha, here's your Japanese candy
package.

00:47:21.631 --> 00:47:27.767
MARISHA: Oh, she gave me my own? Yes!

00:47:27.767 --> 00:47:39.383
TALIESIN: "This puppy I adopted from a shelter and
her name is Lady Kima." It is Lady Kima the puppy.

00:47:39.383 --> 00:47:43.303
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Oh!

00:47:43.303 --> 00:47:48.445
TALIESIN: She sent us a bunch of chocolate
because, obviously, we have a problem. I'm already

00:47:48.445 --> 00:47:50.171
setting aside the chocolate I want.

00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:53.864
MATT: I was trying to get rid of the holiday
weight. Not any more.

00:47:53.864 --> 00:47:57.069
TALIESIN: There's a personalized [inaudible] that
tries to keep your blood sugar up. She also sent

00:47:57.069 --> 00:48:02.961
us this really cool coloring book. There's just
tons of stuff. There's a bunch of personalized

00:48:02.961 --> 00:48:05.281
stuff for everybody, but chocolate and a puppy?

00:48:05.281 --> 00:48:08.069
MATT: "Chocolate and a Puppy" by the way, is our
new sitcom show.

00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:10.503
MARISHA: Aw, you can't go wrong with "Chocolate
and a Puppy."

00:48:10.503 --> 00:48:12.548
TALIESIN: And then there's one for Marisha from
Oxfam Unwrapped.

00:48:12.548 --> 00:48:14.156
MATT: Aw, are these letters for everyone?

00:48:14.156 --> 00:48:15.874
MARISHA: Oxfam!

00:48:15.874 --> 00:48:16.498
MATT: Aw!

00:48:16.498 --> 00:48:21.647
TALIESIN: It's a-- as I'm sniffling so much.

00:48:21.647 --> 00:48:22.782
MATT: It's that season.

00:48:22.782 --> 00:48:24.819
TALIESIN: Yeah, it is that season when we're all
having a little bit of a--

00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:25.802
MATT: These are all letters for the cast?

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:28.326
TALIESIN: Yeah, these are all--

00:48:28.326 --> 00:48:32.776
MATT: I'm going to go put these in the cast pile
and make sure everyone gets these. Travis as well, perfect.

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:38.183
TALIESIN: This is an insane amount of chocolate--
actually, I pulled one out that I'm stealing. I'm

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:43.456
stealing one, and there's nothing that can be
done. Where'd it go?

00:48:43.456 --> 00:48:47.603
MARISHA: Yeah! Oxfam!

00:48:47.603 --> 00:48:54.743
MATT: All right, do you want to trade off,
Marisha?

00:48:54.743 --> 00:48:56.483
TALIESIN: Actually, I'll trade off. It should be
my turn, anyway.

00:48:56.483 --> 00:48:57.093
MARISHA: Sure.

00:48:57.093 --> 00:49:00.255
MATT: Okay. I think Taliesin's going to take the
phone here in a second. I'm going to make some tea

00:49:00.255 --> 00:49:02.186
real fast because my throat's starting to go.

00:49:02.186 --> 00:49:05.973
MARISHA: I know. Is it something in the air or is
it just because?

00:49:05.973 --> 00:49:07.455
MATT: It might be something in the air, I don't
know.

00:49:07.455 --> 00:49:11.815
TALIESIN: It's not like the way that you watch the
little cold grow. It's starting to happen to

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:13.085
everybody two days ago.

00:49:13.085 --> 00:49:13.614
MATT: Oh man.

00:49:13.614 --> 00:49:18.196
MARISHA: Dagon's talking a lot now if people want
to see her, so I'm going to bring in Dagon.

00:49:18.196 --> 00:49:21.359
MATT: All right, you sit the fuck down Marisha and
open some presents while I make some tea.

00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:24.077
TALIESIN: More tea. Put the kettle on.

00:49:24.077 --> 00:49:25.537
BRIAN: Wait, what am I doing?

00:49:25.537 --> 00:49:27.953
TALIESIN: You're going to be opening some
presents. You're going to be grabbing presents--

00:49:27.953 --> 00:49:30.011
BRIAN: Can I play with this X-Acto knife?

00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:31.693
TALIESIN: Actually, we have a safety X-Acto
knife.

00:49:31.693 --> 00:49:35.892
BRIAN: They haven't let me around one of these
since the AIDS.

00:49:35.892 --> 00:49:36.460
MARISHA: Matt?

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.224
MATT: What?

00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:38.912
MARISHA: Come look where Dagon is.

00:49:38.912 --> 00:49:40.700
TALIESIN: Did he go into the fireplace again?

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.720
BRIAN: Okay, let's begin.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.172
TALIESIN: Oh wait, hold on.

00:49:43.172 --> 00:49:46.368
MARISHA: I don't know! Wait, did you know she was
here?

00:49:46.368 --> 00:49:47.418
TALIESIN: No.

00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:57.434
MARISHA: How did you get there, you little shit.
There she is. Dagon, you bad bird.

00:49:57.434 --> 00:49:58.687
MATT: How did she even--?

00:49:58.687 --> 00:50:00.288
TALIESIN: I've already claimed those,
motherfucker!

00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:01.883
BRIAN: No, I'm just trying them on.

00:50:01.883 --> 00:50:05.049
TALIESIN: You want to feel what it's like for one
moment.

00:50:05.049 --> 00:50:06.523
BRIAN: Wow.

00:50:06.523 --> 00:50:09.413
TALIESIN: We'll have a Dagon on camera in one
second.

00:50:09.413 --> 00:50:14.428
BRIAN: This is what happens to my butt if I don't
moisturize.

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:17.649
TALIESIN: And we have a Dagon.

00:50:17.649 --> 00:50:18.279
BRIAN: Hi.

00:50:18.279 --> 00:50:20.186
MARISHA: There you go.

00:50:20.186 --> 00:50:22.486
TALIESIN: Dagon was hiding in the fireplace.

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:25.482
MARISHA: Yeah, a great place for a bird.

00:50:25.482 --> 00:50:26.837
TALIESIN: That is a perfect--

00:50:26.837 --> 00:50:27.986
BRIAN: In the fireplace?

00:50:27.986 --> 00:50:32.094
MARISHA: She was on the glass in the fireplace in
there. I don't even know how she got there, little shit.

00:50:32.094 --> 00:50:33.726
BRIAN: You are a mischievous little fucker.

00:50:33.726 --> 00:50:35.688
MARISHA: She is, actually.

00:50:35.688 --> 00:50:38.297
TALIESIN: Oh, Boris the Spider! Yes. Hi, guys.

00:50:38.297 --> 00:50:39.543
BRIAN: I think Dagon ate Boris.

00:50:39.543 --> 00:50:42.609
TALIESIN: They want to-- Well, he's got a bird,
we'll make him do it later.

00:50:42.609 --> 00:50:44.372
BRIAN: Is that the going theory? What's the
theory?

00:50:44.372 --> 00:50:47.478
TALIESIN: That the spiders follow the fly.

00:50:47.478 --> 00:50:50.511
BRIAN and TALIESIN: (singing) Perhaps she'll die.

00:50:50.511 --> 00:50:53.035
(laughter)

00:50:53.035 --> 00:50:54.820
BRIAN: Give me something to cut with this.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.766
MATT: Yes, here, take this.

00:50:55.766 --> 00:50:56.940
BRIAN: Before I eat Dagon.

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.385
MATT: Deliver you via dragon scale.

00:50:59.385 --> 00:51:01.092
MARISHA: Will you hand me something else?

00:51:01.092 --> 00:51:04.697
BRIAN: I didn't even know you guys were doing this
today. Is this spontaneous?

00:51:04.697 --> 00:51:08.961
TALIESIN: Well, I don't want to say putting it
off, but we've been trying to find an appropriate

00:51:08.961 --> 00:51:13.478
moment, and today is the closest thing that
vaguely resembles some free time that any of us

00:51:13.478 --> 00:51:14.117
have had.

00:51:14.117 --> 00:51:18.360
BRIAN: Yeah. I know, that's why I was-- I'm
driving all over town--

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:23.091
TALIESIN: Oh, Dale, what's up? I miss you, too.
Were you at the Sailor Moon party last night?

00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:27.160
There was a big Sailor Moon party last night,
guys, that was supposed to be amazing. I was like,

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:35.786
no. I was tired, so I watched Westworld. I don't
know if Gilmore got any experience from Thordak. I

00:51:35.786 --> 00:51:37.536
would hope so. It only seems fair.

00:51:37.536 --> 00:51:40.763
MATT: You guys split the experience points with
everyone who helped.

00:51:40.763 --> 00:51:43.684
TALIESIN: Does that mean if we kill all the NPCs
at the end of a big attack, we all get more

00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:45.178
experience points?

00:51:45.178 --> 00:51:47.523
MATT: One way to find out, Taliesin.

00:51:47.523 --> 00:51:49.689
TALIESIN: Okay, just--

00:51:49.689 --> 00:51:53.030
MARISHA: Oh, this is from Matt Gostick.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.298
BRIAN: "Hey, Sam."

00:51:54.298 --> 00:51:56.756
MARISHA: He's one of our OG Critters.

00:51:56.756 --> 00:51:57.432
MATT: Nice!

00:51:57.432 --> 00:51:59.452
TALIESIN: I like that we have OG Critters.

00:51:59.452 --> 00:52:08.178
BRIAN: This is for Sam. "Hey, Sam. I hope this got
to you intact. Enjoy. Chuck." @productiGhoul

00:52:08.178 --> 00:52:14.062
TALIESIN: It's probably spice. Should we leave it
for Sam, then?

00:52:14.062 --> 00:52:17.097
BRIAN: Yeah, let's leave it for Sam. I feel like
it's--

00:52:17.097 --> 00:52:18.595
TALIESIN: It's spice.

00:52:18.595 --> 00:52:20.741
(laughter)

00:52:20.741 --> 00:52:21.659
BRIAN: It feels like--

00:52:21.659 --> 00:52:24.207
TALIESIN: I'm worried about opening any package
for Sam after this week.

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:25.049
BRIAN: I think it's meatloaf.

00:52:25.049 --> 00:52:30.284
TALIESIN: (singing) I would do anything for--
Yeah, it's actually meatloaf.

00:52:30.284 --> 00:52:32.355
BRIAN: I wish. You guys know how much I love
Meatloaf.

00:52:32.355 --> 00:52:33.571
TALIESIN: Do you love Meatloaf?

00:52:33.571 --> 00:52:35.823
BRIAN: Dude, I have seen him three times. I've met
him once.

00:52:35.823 --> 00:52:38.254
TALIESIN: I've met him a couple times, he's pretty
cool.

00:52:38.254 --> 00:52:40.427
BRIAN: Meatloaf's the reason why I became a
singer.

00:52:40.427 --> 00:52:41.527
TALIESIN: I had no idea.

00:52:41.527 --> 00:52:44.773
BRIAN: People laugh at that, but it's true. Nobody
has more emotion in their voice.

00:52:44.773 --> 00:52:48.571
TALIESIN: I'm a Rocky Horror kid, man. There's no
way not to love Meatloaf.

00:52:48.571 --> 00:52:52.951
MARISHA: I've always wanted someone to sing
Paradise by the Dashboard Light with me at

00:52:52.951 --> 00:52:54.697
karaoke, but I could never find anybody.

00:52:54.697 --> 00:52:55.762
BRIAN: I'm your man.

00:52:55.762 --> 00:52:57.047
MARISHA: Really, are you serious?

00:52:57.047 --> 00:52:58.446
BRIAN: I'm your fucking man.

00:52:58.446 --> 00:53:00.151
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is amazing, Foster.

00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:06.431
BRIAN: Steve Jarosz and I-- you know Steve Jarosz.
We sang "I'll Do Anything for Love" at the Saints

00:53:06.431 --> 00:53:13.990
Row wrap party five years ago, maybe. He sang the
girl's part and I sang the main part.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.719
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

00:53:14.719 --> 00:53:19.171
BRIAN: These are some dice for Sam, too. I opened
this, oops. Oh, these are really nice.

00:53:19.219 --> 00:53:27.543
TALIESIN: I love the notion that at a dive bar in
Toronto-- Dude, thank you. (laughs) This is not

00:53:27.543 --> 00:53:32.358
that meeting, dude. God, the comment section's
really funny right now.

00:53:32.358 --> 00:53:34.015
BRIAN: There's so much stuff, you guys.

00:53:34.015 --> 00:53:34.726
MARISHA: I know, man.

00:53:34.726 --> 00:53:36.251
TALIESIN: Apples and oranges--

00:53:36.251 --> 00:53:46.108
MARISHA: Speaking of, he got us cocktail thematic
teas. Pineapple mimosa, raspberry mojito, and

00:53:46.108 --> 00:53:46.538
sangria.

00:53:46.538 --> 00:53:47.712
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:53:47.712 --> 00:53:49.767
BRIAN: What? Tea teas?

00:53:49.767 --> 00:53:51.693
MARISHA: They're tea, but it's--

00:53:51.693 --> 00:53:55.364
BRIAN: Put that with my things. Can I try one of
these?

00:53:55.364 --> 00:53:56.647
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:53:56.647 --> 00:53:58.465
BRIAN: Are these Japanese candies?

00:53:58.465 --> 00:53:59.059
TALIESIN: They are.

00:53:59.059 --> 00:54:00.513
MARISHA: There like fizzy cider candies.

00:54:00.513 --> 00:54:05.565
TALIESIN: Thank you for the hair love, guys. I
think we did Pravana hair colors on--

00:54:05.565 --> 00:54:08.110
MARISHA: Reese's Pieces.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:12.149
TALIESIN: I got a clear dye that makes your hair
glow in blacklight. I'm going to try it out and

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:13.104
let you guys know.

00:54:13.104 --> 00:54:14.270
BRIAN: Do you do it yourself?

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:19.135
TALIESIN: No, no, I have a couple professional
friends and a couple non-professional friends,

00:54:19.135 --> 00:54:20.426
depending on who's available.

00:54:20.426 --> 00:54:22.779
BRIAN: You have friends in every profession.

00:54:22.779 --> 00:54:29.803
TALIESIN: Man, it makes life exciting. Guys, is it
getting a little dark, by the way? Or should I do

00:54:29.803 --> 00:54:31.356
something about the light?

00:54:31.356 --> 00:54:32.426
BRIAN: We can make it really dark.

00:54:32.426 --> 00:54:33.420
MARISHA: The sun is setting.

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.683
BRIAN: (singing) The sun is setting.

00:54:34.683 --> 00:54:36.807
MARISHA: We could always just turn the lights on.

00:54:37.006 --> 00:54:38.799
MATT: Is it too dark on this? Can you go ahead and
just tap?

00:54:38.799 --> 00:54:40.258
TALIESIN: Oh, just tap and it'll--

00:54:40.258 --> 00:54:41.590
BRIAN: Laura Bailey.

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:43.115
MATT: Also, my phone's pretty dark, so it's okay.

00:54:43.115 --> 00:54:44.388
BRIAN: Hang on, Dagon, we're going for a ride.

00:54:44.388 --> 00:54:46.227
TALIESIN: No one seems to be complaining.

00:54:46.227 --> 00:54:47.531
MATT: Good, good.

00:54:47.531 --> 00:54:48.930
BRIAN: Laura Bailey?

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:54.574
TALIESIN: Laura gets a lot of love. There's more.
No worries, there's always more.

00:54:54.574 --> 00:54:56.005
BRIAN: Come here, come here.

00:54:56.005 --> 00:55:00.795
MATT: We have from Tod Dekine, it looks like.

00:55:00.795 --> 00:55:02.844
BRIAN: Smoking that Dekine bud.

00:55:02.844 --> 00:55:06.317
MATT: As well as M.J. Johnson gifts, both for
Laura Bailey. We'll going to make sure those get

00:55:06.317 --> 00:55:08.908
delivered to Laura. Those were received.

00:55:08.908 --> 00:55:11.122
MARISHA: The Pot of Gold is for Laura.

00:55:11.122 --> 00:55:13.471
TALIESIN: Oh, I love Pot of Gold. That stuff's
good!

00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:14.201
MARISHA: I know.

00:55:14.201 --> 00:55:18.162
TALIESIN and MARISHA: It's one of the few good
American chocolate candies.

00:55:18.162 --> 00:55:19.952
BRIAN: We don't <i>have</i> to deliver that to her.

00:55:19.952 --> 00:55:23.828
MARISHA: The Reese's Pieces are for Travis. "I saw
you devour the first batch, so here's another."

00:55:23.828 --> 00:55:27.153
TALIESIN: Instead of doing them all together,
lights, just put them on maximum.

00:55:27.667 --> 00:55:33.504
MARISHA: This is from Gostick, which he said,
"a.k.a. the inferior Matt." Not true, Matt

00:55:33.504 --> 00:55:34.906
Gostick, you are not--

00:55:34.906 --> 00:55:35.607
BRIAN: Oh my God.

00:55:35.607 --> 00:55:36.554
MARISHA: There are no--

00:55:36.554 --> 00:55:37.735
BRIAN: Almost fell over.

00:55:37.735 --> 00:55:41.032
TALIESIN: It's like the Borg, they're kind of all
equal; they share a hive mind.

00:55:41.032 --> 00:55:43.183
MARISHA: Don't fall over with a box cutter and a
bird.

00:55:43.183 --> 00:55:44.794
BRIAN: Wouldn't be my first time.

00:55:44.794 --> 00:55:47.956
TALIESIN: Onto my tea. My tea is behind you, I
might add.

00:55:47.956 --> 00:55:48.496
BRIAN: What?

00:55:48.496 --> 00:55:49.751
MARISHA: And the tea is for us.

00:55:49.751 --> 00:55:52.430
TALIESIN: We didn't make it to Dickens Fair this
year. That really sucked.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:56.287
BRIAN: Aw, we wanted to go so bad! We tried to
make it work, but we couldn't. There's so many

00:55:56.287 --> 00:55:59.822
people, we couldn't find a weekend that-- It's too
close to the holidays.

00:55:59.822 --> 00:56:01.187
MARISHA: We need to plan it.

00:56:01.187 --> 00:56:02.431
TALIESIN: We all just fell apart and sobbed.

00:56:02.431 --> 00:56:04.520
MATT: Want me to take over and you can sit with
them?

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.113
TALIESIN: Sure, it's getting a little fuzzy
anyway.

00:56:06.113 --> 00:56:08.619
MATT: I'll refocus.

00:56:08.619 --> 00:56:09.860
MARISHA: Where is the other--

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.740
BRIAN: You're tickling my neck!

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.751
MATT: Mercer, back at the camera.

00:56:14.751 --> 00:56:16.301
BRIAN: Matt, Marisha.

00:56:16.301 --> 00:56:17.548
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:56:17.548 --> 00:56:20.153
BRIAN: Meghan. (singing) Meghan Levon!

00:56:20.153 --> 00:56:23.801
MARISHA: Meghan already sent a present. Meghan,
you're so silly.

00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:24.586
TALIESIN: He's fired.

00:56:24.586 --> 00:56:26.527
BRIAN: Liam Oberon.

00:56:26.527 --> 00:56:31.683
MARISHA: Liam Oberon's a cool name.

00:56:31.683 --> 00:56:32.425
TALIESIN: Actually, that's pretty cool.

00:56:32.425 --> 00:56:40.897
BRIAN: Mary. Oh, I'm going to see Mary tonight or
tomorrow. I can take this to her.

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:41.740
MATT: Yeah, go and--

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.006
BRIAN: Mary lives down the street from me.

00:56:44.006 --> 00:56:44.477
MATT: Yeah!

00:56:44.477 --> 00:56:51.507
TALIESIN: A lot of just straight letters that we--
I try and read a letter a day. I'm making my way

00:56:51.507 --> 00:56:53.330
through it. Thank you guys.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:57:05.598
MARISHA: This is from Colin from Blueford,
Pennsylvania. Aw, he sent little knitted dragons

00:57:05.598 --> 00:57:07.987
for each one of the Chroma Conclave.

00:57:07.987 --> 00:57:09.935
MATT: Okay, that is awesome.

00:57:09.935 --> 00:57:11.689
BRIAN: Look at this guy.

00:57:11.689 --> 00:57:14.088
MARISHA: Look at this! Oh my goodness!

00:57:14.088 --> 00:57:17.105
BRIAN: Look at the little tongue!

00:57:17.105 --> 00:57:18.983
MATT: That's amazing.

00:57:18.983 --> 00:57:19.873
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

00:57:19.873 --> 00:57:21.665
MATT: Dagon, do you like the Chroma Conclave?

00:57:21.665 --> 00:57:23.034
ALL: No!

00:57:23.034 --> 00:57:23.772
MARISHA: Kill it.

00:57:23.772 --> 00:57:24.581
MATT: Dagon is not a fan

00:57:24.581 --> 00:57:26.357
MARISHA: Yeah, kill it. Kill that dragon.

00:57:26.357 --> 00:57:30.303
BRAIN: Attack! Yes! Nibble at the eyes.

00:57:30.303 --> 00:57:34.736
MARISHA: Oh, here's--

00:57:34.736 --> 00:57:37.321
TALIESIN: This is for Travis, so we'll save that
for later.

00:57:37.321 --> 00:57:41.988
MATT: Wait, did we lose visual? Chatroom, can
people still see or did we lose visual?

00:57:41.988 --> 00:57:45.523
MARISHA: These are cute as shit.

00:57:45.523 --> 00:57:48.503
BRIAN: That is adorable. Who sent those?

00:57:48.503 --> 00:57:51.878
MARISHA: Those are so cute. Colin from
Pennsylvania.

00:57:51.878 --> 00:57:53.930
MATT: We'll swap cameras and see if it fi-- We're
good? Never mind.

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:58.892
TALIESIN: (singing) I'm putting Travis's stuff
aside.

00:57:58.892 --> 00:58:03.697
MARISHA: "To the cast of Critical Role: enclosed
in this box are four of the most dangerous

00:58:03.972 --> 00:58:08.855
"creatures in all of Exandria, shrunk down into
plushie cute forms, of course! However, two have

00:58:08.855 --> 00:58:16.089
"been vanquished, and just like getting the scales
and teeth as trophies, these guys get to go home

00:58:16.089 --> 00:58:23.656
"with the appropriate dragon-killer of Vox Machina.
Which means: Travis gets Umbrasyl, Laura gets

"Vorugal--" Oh, this is cute, "Travis gets Umbrasyl
the Yarn Devourer, Laura gets Vorugal the Knitted

00:58:31.398 --> 00:58:37.599
"Doom, whoever gets the killing blow on the
corresponding dragon gets the plushie counterpart."

00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:38.284
MATT: That's cool.

00:58:38.284 --> 00:58:43.800
MARISHA: "There is still Thordak the Crocheted
King," which goes to Raishan, which we now know.

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.752
Or to--

00:58:44.752 --> 00:58:46.203
MATT and MARISHA: Liam.

00:58:46.203 --> 00:58:51.209
MARISHA: "And Raishan the Darned Deceiver."

00:58:51.209 --> 00:58:52.362
BRIAN: Aw.

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:57.080
MARISHA: That's so cute. Which we don't know yet.

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.828
TALIESIN: Nope, that's one still up for grabs.

00:58:58.828 --> 00:58:59.893
MATT: That's adorable.

00:58:59.893 --> 00:59:06.184
BRIAN: This Japanese candy is really good. But am
I supposed to be seeing my aunt outside the window?

00:59:06.184 --> 00:59:06.974
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, she's there.

00:59:06.974 --> 00:59:08.405
BRIAN: Or is that an effect of the--

00:59:08.405 --> 00:59:10.361
TALIESIN: It's fascinating, too, 'cause you don't
have an aunt.

00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:11.815
BRIAN: What's weird is I have no aunts.

00:59:11.815 --> 00:59:13.712
TALIESIN: Yeah. And yet, there she is.

00:59:13.712 --> 00:59:17.367
BRIAN: No family in this continent. Oh, look at
this. What's this?

00:59:17.367 --> 00:59:19.946
MATT: Oh, your wife made those between her ER
shifts? That's amazing!

00:59:19.946 --> 00:59:21.729
MARISHA and TALIESIN: What?

00:59:21.729 --> 00:59:22.318
TALIESIN: No!

00:59:22.318 --> 00:59:25.617
BRIAN: Critical Role coloring book 2016.

00:59:25.617 --> 00:59:26.299
TALIESIN: Oh no!

00:59:26.299 --> 00:59:31.577
BRIAN: Hold on, let me see if there's a note
saying who it's from. Oh, there is!

00:59:31.577 --> 00:59:33.746
MARISHA: Where'd the other box cutter go?

00:59:33.746 --> 00:59:35.509
BRIAN: Right here! Or, he's got one.

00:59:35.509 --> 00:59:36.755
MARISHA: But there's two!

00:59:36.755 --> 00:59:38.194
MATT: There are two around.

00:59:38.194 --> 00:59:44.542
TALIESIN: Not sitting on one. No. I'm just
sitting-- Oh, here's a box cutter.

00:59:44.542 --> 00:59:46.971
BRIAN: Maybe that's why my taint is bleeding.

00:59:46.971 --> 00:59:51.144
MATT: Aw, Marisha, you are Stacy's spirit animal.

00:59:51.144 --> 00:59:55.373
MARISHA: Aw. I'm someone's spirit animal.

00:59:55.373 --> 00:59:59.364
BRIAN: "Dear Matt: I wasn't able to get everyone's
copy out in time for Critmas. Unfortunately, I

00:59:59.364 --> 01:00:03.432
"have been dealing with pretty heavy family issues.
This is your copy, and everyone else is about a

01:00:03.432 --> 01:00:05.848
"week behind. Have fun. Love, Ellie."

01:00:05.848 --> 01:00:07.464
MATT: Aw, thank you, Ellie.

01:00:07.464 --> 01:00:10.719
TALIESIN: With the speed we're at, it's entirely
possible they're in here.

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:14.959
BRIAN: "Please accept this gift from me and from
the Critters for all you do for others, for

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:20.156
"bringing us all together as the biggest family on
the earth." Ain't that the truth. This is so dope.

01:00:20.156 --> 01:00:25.801
MATT: That is amazing. Coloring book is from all
the Critters and composed by their editor, Ellie Bright.

01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:26.685
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

01:00:26.685 --> 01:00:28.492
BRIAN: Oh, Ashley's going to love this.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:30.219
MATT: These are so cool.

01:00:30.219 --> 01:00:32.056
BRIAN: Wow, that's beautiful.

01:00:32.056 --> 01:00:34.647
MATT: I love it.

01:00:34.647 --> 01:00:37.098
BRIAN: Wow.

01:00:37.098 --> 01:00:40.393
MATT: Show off some more of the art to the camera.

01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:41.679
BRIAN: Dude.

01:00:41.679 --> 01:00:43.581
MATT: That's incredible.

01:00:43.581 --> 01:00:54.363
BRIAN: I'll turn it closer. That's really great.
Man. Ha, I love it.

01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:55.924
MATT: Bench pressing.

01:00:55.924 --> 01:01:02.918
BRIAN: Look at those abs. Oh, wow! That is so
dope.

01:01:02.918 --> 01:01:08.336
MATT: Wow, that's so pretty!

01:01:08.336 --> 01:01:09.851
MARISHA: That's amazing!

01:01:09.851 --> 01:01:14.220
BRIAN: Get your fine tipped coloring pencils or
pens out.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.307
MATT: Hell yeah. So cool!

01:01:16.307 --> 01:01:23.681
BRIAN: "Percy explains a project--" I'm reading
upside down, "a project only a few really follow."

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:24.860
MATT: Sounds about right.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:28.304
MARISHA: It's okay. You don't have to make
excuses. We're not angry.

01:01:28.304 --> 01:01:31.666
BRIAN: I don't read good. Hey, how'd you get over
there?

01:01:31.666 --> 01:01:40.340
TALIESIN: We got a bunch of fabulous friendship
bracelets from KatieTheFlyingCat1, including ones

01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:43.598
for Will and Mary and Brian, because Brian is left
out.

01:01:43.598 --> 01:01:46.041
MATT: Not for long.

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:46.873
BRIAN: It says that?

01:01:46.873 --> 01:01:48.747
TALIESIN: Yeah, it does, right there.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:52.011
BRIAN: Oh, that's so sweet! Brian's not left out.

01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:57.519
TALIESIN: Although I don't see yours here. I guess
she forgot it. So sad.

01:01:57.519 --> 01:01:59.016
MATT: Brian wasn't included to begin with.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:01.197
BRIAN: My dad forgot a bunch of stuff growing up,
too.

01:02:01.197 --> 01:02:03.631
TALIESIN: Keep rubbing it in, man. Keep rubbing it
in.

01:02:03.631 --> 01:02:05.100
BRIAN: Like my soccer games.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:10.139
MARISHA: These are awesome! Oh, these are so cute.

01:02:10.139 --> 01:02:11.551
MATT: These are awesome.

01:02:11.551 --> 01:02:17.228
MARISHA: I haven't had a friendship bracelet in so
long.

01:02:17.228 --> 01:02:18.787
TALIESIN: Here's one for Matt.

01:02:18.787 --> 01:02:26.329
MATT: Yes! Look at that. FPS Mercer view of my
friendship bracelet. Thank you!

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:30.188
MARISHA: I'm going to have to get this on.

01:02:30.188 --> 01:02:32.893
TALIESIN: I know, dude. It's like we're back in
summer camp.

01:02:32.893 --> 01:02:34.687
MARISHA: I love friendship bracelets.

01:02:34.687 --> 01:02:35.894
TALIESIN: I do, too!

01:02:35.894 --> 01:02:37.972
MARISHA: I like seeing how long they last.

01:02:37.972 --> 01:02:40.285
TALIESIN: Yeah, like, how long can I wear this in
the shower?

01:02:40.285 --> 01:02:42.271
MARISHA: How long can I wear this in the shower,
exactly.

01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:43.799
BRIAN: I love bracelets.

01:02:43.799 --> 01:02:49.133
MATT: Oh shit. The coloring book was composed by
the director of the Crit Role short films that

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:49.777
we've seen.

01:02:49.777 --> 01:02:52.171
TALIESIN: Oh shit! Those have been really great.

01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:59.917
BRIAN: That makes sense as to why the art is
kickass as fuck. Marsha Ray.

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:02.514
TALIESIN: Is that a Marsha? Who's this? Oh, this
is for me.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:12.175
BRIAN: Columbus Zoo and Aquarium?

01:03:12.175 --> 01:03:13.423
TALIESIN: It's a fish.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:16.257
MARISHA: Yeah, tilapia.

01:03:16.257 --> 01:03:18.003
BRIAN: It's dinner, Dagon.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:23.739
MARISHA: This is from Shay. "I can't begin to
express to you all how much enjoyment I have

01:03:24.119 --> 01:03:29.806
"received from the hundreds of hours of this show.
I wanted to show my gratitude in the crafty way I

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:40.982
"could, so please enjoy. P.S. ones for the crew are
forthcoming." So she is sending more. I'm sure one

01:03:40.982 --> 01:03:42.155
for you, as well.

01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:46.117
MATT: We do still have your bead bracelets, by the
way. They were awesome.

01:03:46.117 --> 01:03:46.704
MARISHA: Here, Matt.

01:03:46.704 --> 01:03:50.381
MATT: Oh, I fell.

01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:51.421
MARISHA: Oh jeez!

01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:55.248
MATT: A whole piece of furniture moved forward.
Sorry, guys. You got to have a front side view of

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.254
me stumbling.

01:03:56.254 --> 01:04:03.260
BRIAN: No way. You guys are going to flip out at
this. "This is a certificate from the Columbus Zoo

01:04:24.472 --> 01:04:25.887
BRIAN: The animals guy. Remember the show?

01:04:25.887 --> 01:04:27.618
MARISHA: Oh.

01:04:27.618 --> 01:04:37.300
BRIAN: Look! They sent a little black bear, a
postcard from the zoo, and then there's a little

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.739
note here. Let me read it.

01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.332
TALIESIN: If you would ever like to see the black
bear again--

01:04:40.332 --> 01:04:43.432
(laughter)

01:04:43.432 --> 01:04:44.609
TALIESIN: Carry on, carry on.

01:04:44.609 --> 01:04:46.918
BRIAN: No, let's go there. "Dear Laura and
Trinket--"

01:04:46.918 --> 01:04:48.726
MARISHA: You <i>will</i> support black bears.

01:04:48.726 --> 01:04:53.229
BRIAN: "You've been given a very special gift: a
black bear adoption from the Columbus Zoo and

01:04:53.526 --> 01:04:57.426
"Aquarium. This gift provides enrichment activities
and healthy food and treats to our black bears. We

01:04:57.426 --> 01:05:02.258
"hope you can visit them soon. This adoption gift
is from Elizabeth Hammons."

01:05:02.258 --> 01:05:03.721
MATT and BRIAN: Thank you, Elizabeth!

01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:04.570
MARISHA: Thank you!

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:05.297
MATT: That's so rad.

01:05:05.297 --> 01:05:08.044
MARISHA: These are amazing.

01:05:08.044 --> 01:05:11.470
BRIAN: That is so cool.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:12.942
MARISHA: Keyleth's circlet. What's yours?

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.173
TALIESIN: Mine is little glasses.

01:05:14.173 --> 01:05:15.663
MARISHA: Your glasses with Orthax.

01:05:15.663 --> 01:05:19.792
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Glasses with sad smoke.

01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:21.467
TALIESIN: Thank you!

01:05:21.467 --> 01:05:22.745
MATT: Those cross stitches are so cute.

01:05:22.745 --> 01:05:26.058
TALIESIN: Cross-stitch, man. There's a time.

01:05:26.058 --> 01:05:30.196
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. Oh, are you on a rampage?
You on a little birdy rampage?

01:05:30.196 --> 01:05:31.732
MATT: Are you on a rampage?

01:05:31.732 --> 01:05:32.647
TALIESIN: Just grab whatever.

01:05:32.647 --> 01:05:33.970
MARISHA: Go to daddy.

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:37.835
MATT: Get them, Dagon. Dagon's just--

01:05:37.835 --> 01:05:39.104
MARISHA: She wants Dad.

01:05:39.104 --> 01:05:39.857
MATT: She wants me?

01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:42.792
BRIAN: Ooh, this one's from the IRS! I'm just
kidding.

01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:46.425
MATT: Thank you, Dagon. Dagon, say hi to all the
Critters out there.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:48.709
MATT and MARISHA: Pew pew!

01:05:48.709 --> 01:05:49.533
MATT: Dagon!

01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:50.283

01:06:06.116 --> 01:06:06.736
MATT: Dagon!

01:06:06.736 --> 01:06:07.526
DAGON: (chirping)

01:06:07.526 --> 01:06:08.776

01:06:14.936 --> 01:06:15.986
DAGON: (chirping)

01:06:15.986 --> 01:06:16.926
TALIESIN: Oh this is from Nuri McBride.

01:06:16.926 --> 01:06:17.977
MATT: Hey buddy!

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.886
DAGON: (chirping)

01:06:19.886 --> 01:06:20.513
TALIESIN: Nice.

01:06:20.513 --> 01:06:22.480
MATT: Okay, you can stay on my shoulder, Dagon.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.315
MARISHA: Aww! Is this someone else?

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:29.798
TALIESIN: Aww. Thank you, Nuri. This is great.

01:06:29.798 --> 01:06:33.881
MARISHA: Yeah, Nuri. Oh wow.

01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:36.707
TALIESIN: May this year not be a dumpster fire.
Man.

01:06:36.707 --> 01:06:37.909
BRIAN: Amen.

01:06:37.909 --> 01:06:39.143
MATT: Amen to that.

01:06:39.143 --> 01:06:47.935
MARISHA: Donated to rescue.org. "I tried to do a
Critical Role themed donations gift, but instead

01:06:47.935 --> 01:06:52.348
"I'd like to thank you for being a badass chick on
the internet by donating to help a refugee mother

01:06:52.348 --> 01:07:01.284
"give birth in safety and a $50 donation to the
Nature Conservancy," on top of that which is incredible!

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:01.873
BRIAN: That's dope.

01:07:01.873 --> 01:07:07.052
MARISHA: Keep kicking ass in 2017. Love, Nuri.
Thank you so much!

01:07:07.052 --> 01:07:13.978
MATT: Nuri, thank you so much! These are
incredible. Nuri McBride made a $50 donation to

01:07:13.978 --> 01:07:19.758
First Book in our name, too, which is my chosen
charity, this is amazing. Thank you so much, Nuri!

01:07:19.758 --> 01:07:21.428
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. That's so generous!

01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:23.187
TALIESIN: Nuri, thank you very much. That's really
nice.

01:07:23.187 --> 01:07:24.912
BRIAN: Is it illegal to burn all the trash?

01:07:24.912 --> 01:07:29.581
TALIESIN: Only if you don't accidentally set it on
fire, if that's what's happening.

01:07:29.581 --> 01:07:30.976
BRIAN: I do a lot of things by accident.

01:07:30.976 --> 01:07:32.964
MARISHA: It's 2017, who knows.

01:07:32.964 --> 01:07:35.186
TALIESIN: All bets are off now.

01:07:35.534 --> 01:07:38.335
MARISHA: All bets are off. Where's the box
cutter?

01:07:38.335 --> 01:07:39.451
BRIAN: Oh, here.

01:07:39.451 --> 01:07:40.893
MARISHA: I want my friend, Mr. Box Cutter.

01:07:40.893 --> 01:07:43.571
BRIAN: Safety first.

01:07:43.571 --> 01:07:47.634
MATT: There we go. It's important. Make sure you
don't cut yourself.

01:07:47.634 --> 01:07:50.584
TALIESIN: This is the silliest gift ever. Zack,
Tico, hi.

01:07:50.584 --> 01:07:52.154
MATT: Oh, it's from Tico?

01:07:52.154 --> 01:07:56.067
TALIESIN: It's so silly I don't even know if we
should show it.

01:07:56.067 --> 01:07:57.369
MATT: I think you should, then.

01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:58.288
TALIESIN: But, like--

01:07:58.288 --> 01:07:59.972
MARISHA: Uh-oh.

01:07:59.972 --> 01:08:07.576
TALIESIN: I'll show part of it. Hi guys!

01:08:07.576 --> 01:08:11.669
MARISHA: I will utilize that in a couple hours.

01:08:11.669 --> 01:08:14.176
TALIESIN: I know you will, which is why I laughed
my ass off right now. I was like oh, that's going

01:08:14.176 --> 01:08:15.881
to be gone before the day is up.

01:08:15.881 --> 01:08:18.053
MATT: Safety forced.

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:20.587
TALIESIN: Thanks Tico, thanks Zack.

01:08:20.587 --> 01:08:22.216
MATT: That's amazing. Thank you guys!

01:08:22.216 --> 01:08:25.976
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

01:08:25.976 --> 01:08:27.597
BRIAN: And Ashley's is going home with me.

01:08:27.597 --> 01:08:29.177
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a little pile for Ashley
over here.

01:08:29.177 --> 01:08:37.201
BRIAN: This note says, very quickly, Four score
and se-- "To the members of Vox Machina, and the

01:08:56.551 --> 01:09:01.039
"P.S. Thank you for bringing to life this wonderful
tale. It has truly been a blessing in my life."

01:09:01.039 --> 01:09:02.015
And they sent--

01:09:02.015 --> 01:09:05.410
TALIESIN: That's pretty gilded.

01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:07.387
BRIAN and MATT: An ancient brass dragon.

01:09:07.387 --> 01:09:10.920
MATT: That is awesome.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.689
MARISHA and BRIAN: J'mon!

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.464
MATT: J'mon Sa'Ord!

01:09:13.464 --> 01:09:24.434
MARISHA: Meghan LeVaughn sent more journals for
us. Good things are happening journals. Yeah. So

01:09:24.434 --> 01:09:32.051
whoever would like a journal, those are from
Meghan. Because Meghan is sweet and enjoys

01:09:32.051 --> 01:09:33.509
spoiling us so much.

01:09:33.509 --> 01:09:36.088
BRIAN: Meghan needs her own jingle.

01:09:36.088 --> 01:09:39.075
TALIESIN: A Meghan LeVaughn jingle?

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.648
BRIAN: (singing) Oh Meghan LeVaughn!

01:09:41.648 --> 01:09:43.132
MATT: What you got, Taliesin?

01:09:43.132 --> 01:09:45.890
TALIESIN: I got a letter, at the moment, so I'm
just going through that.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:50.184
MATT: Oh, gotcha. We've actually made a pretty
decent dent.

01:09:50.184 --> 01:09:55.072
TALIESIN: We have made a decent dent. I don't
normally get delved into letters on-screen, but

01:09:55.072 --> 01:09:59.334
this got-- This is from Amanda. I will finish this
later.

01:09:59.334 --> 01:09:59.893
BRIAN: J'mon.

01:09:59.893 --> 01:10:02.222
TALIESIN: Oh, are we mounting--

01:10:02.222 --> 01:10:06.987
MATT: What kind of bird is it?
Dagon is a cinnamon green-cheeked

01:10:06.987 --> 01:10:10.097
conure. She is adorable.

01:10:10.097 --> 01:10:11.358
TALIESIN: Oh my god, there's still more.

01:10:11.358 --> 01:10:12.168
BRIAN: This is dope.

01:10:12.168 --> 01:10:15.100
MATT: Where is she? There she is. Hi, Dagon.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.052
BRIAN: Brass dragon!

01:10:16.052 --> 01:10:17.169
MATT: Dagon, don't get angry.

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:18.598
TALIESIN and BRIAN: That funky dragon!

01:10:18.598 --> 01:10:23.599
MARISHA: Thank you so much, Amanda, for
the letter. It was amazing also meeting you at Gen

01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:29.981
Con, and she said she was looking forward to your
Halloween episodes of Signal Boost, Taliesin. I'm

01:10:29.981 --> 01:10:31.259
assuming she has watched them--

01:10:31.259 --> 01:10:32.943
TALIESIN: This must have come from the box
of--

01:10:32.943 --> 01:10:34.026
MATT: Things that got lost.

01:10:34.026 --> 01:10:35.397
TALIESIN: Things that got lost at the studio.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:36.568
MATT: Yes, most likely.

01:10:36.568 --> 01:10:37.587
BRIAN: Signal Boost!

01:10:37.587 --> 01:10:40.075
MARISHA: Yes, but thank you so much, Amanda.

01:10:40.075 --> 01:10:42.785
TALIESIN: There is a box of things that
got lost at the studio.

01:10:42.785 --> 01:10:48.441
MATT: Thank you, Meghan. All right,
Marisha, the journals are for you and me.

01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:50.674
MARISHA: Aww! Thank you, Meghan.

01:10:50.674 --> 01:10:53.647
TALIESIN: Is she on stream right now?

01:10:53.647 --> 01:10:54.233
MATT: Yeah.

01:10:54.233 --> 01:10:55.848
TALIESIN: Hi, dear. Hi.

01:10:55.848 --> 01:10:59.968
MARISHA: I'm going to go get another box.

01:10:59.968 --> 01:11:01.759
TALIESIN: Well we got the-- whoa.

01:11:01.759 --> 01:11:02.566
BRIAN: Everything's fine.

01:11:02.566 --> 01:11:03.136
TALIESIN: You're fine.

01:11:03.136 --> 01:11:04.381
MATT: Good job, Brian, good job.

01:11:04.381 --> 01:11:12.578
BRIAN: Class and caress and ease, that's me.
Okay, this is wrapped so pretty.

01:11:12.578 --> 01:11:14.656
MATT: Aww, Medley's a great name for a conure.

01:11:14.656 --> 01:11:16.062
TALIESIN: Yeah, no attack attack.

01:11:16.062 --> 01:11:17.682
BRIAN: Attack, attack?

01:11:17.682 --> 01:11:22.455
MATT: There is more Signal Boost coming.
They're shooting tomorrow, I think.

01:11:22.455 --> 01:11:23.173
BRIAN: Signal Boost!

01:11:23.173 --> 01:11:27.490
MARISHA: Yep, shooting tomorrow.
Brian's going to come host an episode.

01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:31.690
BRIAN: Brian's going to come host an
episode next month. Can I signal boost Signal Boost?

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:35.055
MARISHA: I mean, I think you're
technically doing it right now, yeah.

01:11:35.055 --> 01:11:35.924
BRIAN: There you go.

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:38.292
MATT: They're asking how's Denise.

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:46.681
BRIAN: Denise is great. She had a good break. When
she got back, she was less agitated with me than usual.

01:11:47.016 --> 01:11:49.334
TALIESIN: She had her sass back.

01:11:49.334 --> 01:11:53.073
BRIAN: There's so much fanart coming in of people
speculating what she looks like.

01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:53.667
TALIESIN: Really?

01:11:53.667 --> 01:11:55.521
BRIAN: Yeah, that's why we're
having--

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:56.694
TALIESIN: I'm so excited now.

01:11:56.694 --> 01:12:00.747
BRIAN: That's why we're not going to show her for the
longest time, because it's so much fun. Plus she--

01:12:00.747 --> 01:12:01.868
MARISHA: It's going to be like--

01:12:01.868 --> 01:12:03.334
BRIAN: She loves all the love she's getting.

01:12:03.334 --> 01:12:08.696
MARISHA: When it finally happens, when KISS
finally went on air without their makeup on.

01:12:08.696 --> 01:12:09.740
That's what it's going to be like.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.371
BRIAN: I told her the other night, I
was showing her a lot of the stuff that people

01:12:12.371 --> 01:12:17.089
were saying on the internet, like everyone who
emails in fanart or gifs, they're like, hey, say

01:12:17.089 --> 01:12:19.352
hi to Denise for me. She wouldn't believe it. I
showed her--

01:12:19.352 --> 01:12:22.541
TALIESIN: This box is from pindragon, on Twitter.

01:12:22.541 --> 01:12:23.054
MATT: Whoa!

01:12:23.054 --> 01:12:25.204
TALIESIN: I believe. Was this the blue thing?

01:12:25.204 --> 01:12:33.729
BRIAN: Peg Leg Porker, Tennessee straight bourbon whiskey,
aged eight years. I love you guys, I have had a great

01:12:33.729 --> 01:12:42.737
time. Peyton and I are going to drink in the alley
behind your house. Wow, this is really fancy.

01:12:42.737 --> 01:12:44.352
MARISHA: Holy shit, wow, man.

01:12:44.352 --> 01:12:46.036
TALIESIN: Save this for later.

01:12:46.036 --> 01:12:47.143
BRIAN: Let's make mistakes.

01:12:47.143 --> 01:12:49.827
TALIESIN: Boy, that should be our calling card.

01:12:49.827 --> 01:12:52.279
BRIAN: Yeah, right? Let's make mistakes.

01:12:52.279 --> 01:12:59.895
TALIESIN: Has anyone nailed the
description of her perfectly yet? No one?

01:12:59.895 --> 01:13:01.813
BRIAN: She's got such a unique--

01:13:01.813 --> 01:13:09.104
TALIESIN: It's like the opening of The Good Place,
where this one guy who guessed 96% right with the afterlife.

01:13:09.104 --> 01:13:09.748
BRIAN: Yeah.

01:13:09.748 --> 01:13:11.764
TALIESIN: 1972 on mushrooms.

01:13:11.764 --> 01:13:14.691
BRIAN: You got the note that was attached to it,
right?

01:13:15.156 --> 01:13:15.893
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have it.

01:13:15.893 --> 01:13:16.869
MATT: Who's it from? Who's the note?

01:13:16.869 --> 01:13:20.182
BRIAN: It was from-- I was
distracted by the word whiskey.

01:13:20.182 --> 01:13:21.709
MATT: Yeah, that happens.

01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:23.082
TALIESIN: It was pindragon.

01:13:23.082 --> 01:13:24.403
MATT: Pendragon, that's right.

01:13:24.403 --> 01:13:24.945
TALIESIN: Pin.

01:13:24.945 --> 01:13:26.336
MATT: Thank you, pindragon.

01:13:26.336 --> 01:13:30.327
MARISHA: Oh yeah, pindragon
has sent stuff before, right?

01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:32.534
MATT: Yeah. Dagon.

01:13:32.534 --> 01:13:39.060
BRIAN: There's a Magic prerelease today.
That's why the comic stores and the game stores

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.345
were so full of people.

01:13:40.345 --> 01:13:41.486
MATT: Oh, that makes sense.

01:13:41.486 --> 01:13:43.612
BRIAN: Because I went to Emerald Nights and
The Paper Heroes.

01:13:43.612 --> 01:13:46.976
TALIESIN: I thought I saw an old friend
of mine there, too. We went to Early Bite.

01:13:46.976 --> 01:13:53.480
BRIAN: Magic prerelease. And they tell me the arcane
spell cards are gone, because they're revamping

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.620
them. I went to go get them today, they said they
were revamping them.

01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:58.295
MATT: Oh?

01:13:58.295 --> 01:14:06.023
BRIAN: But I need them for my home game.
Look at this, Taliesin.

01:14:06.023 --> 01:14:10.039
TALIESIN: I didn't tape this. You know
what's happening here?

01:14:10.039 --> 01:14:11.212
MATT: What's this, Marisha?

01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:13.101
MARISHA: Shut. Up.

01:14:13.101 --> 01:14:13.825
MATT: What?

01:14:13.825 --> 01:14:15.842
TALIESIN: Thief.

01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:26.355
MARISHA: This is from Dana. 
"I love watching the show, but I have a lot

01:14:26.355 --> 01:14:30.830

multitasking. So since I was in a sewing rut at

01:14:57.114 --> 01:14:57.982
"Hope you like them. Dana. Attached is a plaiting
guide because I thought it was cute." Hope you

01:14:57.982 --> 01:14:59.056
guys are ready for this.

01:14:59.056 --> 01:15:00.563
TALIESIN: We assemble this into a new player.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:01.340
MARISHA: Matt?

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:04.529
MATT: Yeah? What? I'm holding a bird.

01:15:04.529 --> 01:15:05.763
TALIESIN: Woo!

01:15:05.763 --> 01:15:08.414
BRIAN: Here, Matt, trade me.

01:15:08.414 --> 01:15:10.350
MARISHA: Travis, Ashley--

01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:11.511
MATT: You want to take over?

01:15:11.511 --> 01:15:12.915
BRIAN: Yeah, trade me. You need to be in there.

01:15:12.915 --> 01:15:14.256
MARISHA: Do you want to open Ashley's?

01:15:14.256 --> 01:15:14.701
BRIAN: Yeah.

01:15:14.701 --> 01:15:15.931
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:15:15.931 --> 01:15:19.863
MATT: All right, take this here camera. I'm going
to step in where you were.

01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:20.420
BRIAN: I got it.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:24.483
MARISHA: Liam, Taliesin--

01:15:24.483 --> 01:15:31.976
MATT: Why not? I get curious. And sit down, okay.

01:15:31.976 --> 01:15:34.992
TALIESIN: This is a box-- I don't even want to say
who it's--

01:15:34.992 --> 01:15:35.839
MARISHA: Wait, open it first.

01:15:35.839 --> 01:15:36.872
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, okay.

01:15:36.872 --> 01:15:42.206
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:15:42.206 --> 01:15:44.981
BRIAN: Oh my god.

01:15:44.981 --> 01:15:46.862
TALIESIN: (cackling)

01:15:46.862 --> 01:15:47.716
MATT: Holy shit!

01:15:47.716 --> 01:15:49.380
TALIESIN: Oh shit. Oh my god!

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.594
MARISHA: I want to see yours, let me see yours!

01:15:50.594 --> 01:15:53.745
TALIESIN: It gets better. Wait.

01:15:53.745 --> 01:15:55.448
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:15:55.448 --> 01:15:57.023
TALIESIN: Oh shit, does it get better.

01:15:57.023 --> 01:16:00.510
MARISHA: Yours comes with the little mask? Shut
up.

01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:01.875
TALIESIN: Oh wait, does it attach to its--

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:03.422
MARISHA: And yours comes with the little hood!

01:16:03.422 --> 01:16:09.439
MATT: Mine has a little hood. It's got lightning
around my head, but it also comes with a Victor

01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:11.678
mask that I can put on.

01:16:11.678 --> 01:16:13.058
MARISHA: Yours comes with masks?

01:16:13.058 --> 01:16:14.632
TALIESIN: The Victor mask is really rocking.

01:16:14.632 --> 01:16:16.311
MARISHA and MATT: That's amazing!

01:16:16.311 --> 01:16:18.156
BRIAN: Where did the chat go? Did you hide it?

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:21.077
MATT: Gilmore-- I think it's lagging a little bit,
so it might pop up in a bit.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.997
BRIAN: It's lagging a little bit? Okay.

01:16:22.997 --> 01:16:31.517
MATT: I think so. A little Gilmore mask, which is
awesome, and a Clarota mask. How cool is that? I

01:16:31.517 --> 01:16:32.109
love it!

01:16:32.109 --> 01:16:33.472
BRIAN: Those are dope.

01:16:33.472 --> 01:16:34.498
MATT: These are amazing.

01:16:34.498 --> 01:16:38.399
MARISHA: These are adorable. Those masks are
legit, oh my god.

01:16:38.399 --> 01:16:39.528
BRIAN: That is great! Who's that from?

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.832
MARISHA: Hand-sewn-- Dana?

01:16:40.832 --> 01:16:43.264
MATT: Dana, these are amazing!

01:16:43.264 --> 01:16:45.903
BRIAN and MARISHA: Dana!

01:16:45.903 --> 01:16:53.005
MARISHA: Wow. These are amazing. Thank you, Dana!

01:16:53.005 --> 01:16:58.140
MATT: Thank you for the drawing, Dana! Awesome
dragon picture on the back. Thordak, just Thordak.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.863
That's amazing!

01:16:59.863 --> 01:17:02.536
BRIAN: (singing) Thordak, the Cinder King.

01:17:02.536 --> 01:17:03.052
TALIESIN: Woo!

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:06.686
MATT: Thank you, Dana.

01:17:06.686 --> 01:17:14.003
TALIESIN: Thank you so much! Yes, I love the
mini-Percy, this is amazing. Okay, this box is

01:17:14.003 --> 01:17:23.774
from Mavis, Andrew. I don't want to say where he
works yet, because I think it's going to be a nice surprise.

01:17:23.774 --> 01:17:26.178
MATT: Oh boy. I like surprises.

01:17:26.178 --> 01:17:28.478
MARISHA: Which box? Is that this box?

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:34.249
TALIESIN: This box. I kind of know what's coming.
Be gentle. In fact, let's cut the duct tape.

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:37.250
MATT: All right. I'm curious.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:46.617
BRIAN: "Denise is really a dragon and she does not
want to be on camera." (chuckling) What class are

01:17:46.617 --> 01:17:50.422
you playing, Beeron? That's funny. What's up,
BryGuy? Wow.

01:17:50.422 --> 01:17:51.791
MATT: That's actually glued to--

01:17:51.791 --> 01:17:55.080
TALIESIN: It's glued to the--? Okay, we're just
going to have to be a little careful then. All

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.007
right, here we go.

01:17:56.007 --> 01:17:57.897
BRIAN: Think I'm playing a human wizard.

01:17:57.897 --> 01:17:59.757
MARISHA: What now?

01:17:59.757 --> 01:18:01.395
BRIAN: Oh, look at this. I saw this earlier.

01:18:01.395 --> 01:18:05.762
TALIESIN: This is a gift from Red Ship Brewery in
Buffalo, New York.

01:18:05.762 --> 01:18:08.057
MATT: What? Oat cocoa stout?

01:18:08.057 --> 01:18:10.227
MARISHA: And some Buffalo wing sauce.

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:14.522
MATT: Festhalle Dark.

01:18:14.522 --> 01:18:16.261
TALIESIN: From his home brewery in Buffalo.

01:18:16.261 --> 01:18:17.579
MATT: That's so awesome!

01:18:17.579 --> 01:18:18.659
MARISHA: Holy shit!

01:18:18.659 --> 01:18:21.255
MATT: (Scottish accent) Wee little Red Head there
for you.

01:18:21.255 --> 01:18:23.859
MARISHA: (British accent) Oh, is that for your
little redhead?

01:18:23.859 --> 01:18:26.856
TALIESIN: Sponge candy, we were just having a
conversation about sponge candy, that's hilarious.

01:18:26.856 --> 01:18:29.411
BRIAN: High elf barbarian, that's really cool.

01:18:29.411 --> 01:18:31.323
MATT: We have Rocket sauce, sponge candy.

01:18:31.323 --> 01:18:33.187
MARISHA: (shouting) Sponge candy!

01:18:33.187 --> 01:18:35.531
MATT: That is awesome.

01:18:35.531 --> 01:18:37.181
TALIESIN: That's totally a thing.

01:18:37.201 --> 01:18:37.759
MARISHA: What?

01:18:37.759 --> 01:18:40.186
TALIESIN: The sponge candy, we were--

01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:42.670
MARISHA: Yeah, we had some in there. It was so
good.

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:43.247
TALIESIN: We did.

01:18:43.247 --> 01:18:46.332
MARISHA: I just got some the other day.

01:18:46.332 --> 01:18:47.295
BRIAN: Best place?

01:18:47.295 --> 01:18:49.664
MATT: Andrew. Thank you so much.

01:18:49.664 --> 01:18:50.675
BRIAN: Thank you, Andrew.

01:18:50.675 --> 01:18:51.933
TALIESIN: Incredible. Andrew Herman.

01:18:51.933 --> 01:18:55.768
BRIAN: Did you guys open a Christmas card already
from TheAnime-- somebody?

01:18:55.768 --> 01:18:57.765
MATT: From-- it's probably Meghan.

01:18:57.765 --> 01:18:59.067
BRIAN: Oh, Meghan! Yeah!

01:18:59.067 --> 01:18:59.937
MARISHA: Yeah, we opened her card.

01:18:59.937 --> 01:19:03.372
BRIAN: Yeah, sorry, the chat moved too fast,
Meghan. I couldn't see your name. Yeah, they got it.

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:05.530
MATT: Letters can go over there.

01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:08.725
TALIESIN: That's awesome.

01:19:08.725 --> 01:19:17.419
BRIAN: Scheduled to ship in March? But I'm
starting my game next week. They just let me know.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.199
MARISHA and MATT: Aw.

01:19:19.199 --> 01:19:20.783
MATT: We got more boxes.

01:19:20.783 --> 01:19:21.427
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:19:21.427 --> 01:19:25.293
MATT: Put the small ones here on the-- we'll do
the big ones last, how about that?

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:28.040
TALIESIN: Yeah. Here's a tube. Oh, it's for me.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.389
MATT: It's for you, open the tube!

01:19:29.389 --> 01:19:30.585
TALIESIN: I weirdly get a lot of tubes.

01:19:30.585 --> 01:19:36.478
MATT: (Scottish accent) Open your tube! Do it,
sir! Let's see what's inside your tubes. I am

01:19:36.478 --> 01:19:39.006
personally quite curious, so open up.

01:19:39.006 --> 01:19:42.948
BRIAN: I don't know if I'm going to be a standard
human or variant yet. Someone tell me what I

01:19:42.948 --> 01:19:43.770
should do.

01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:47.323
TALIESIN: It all depends on what kind of character
you want to play, man. We'll figure it out.

01:19:47.323 --> 01:19:50.150
BRIAN: I figured out his name today, I spend three
hours on his name today.

01:19:50.150 --> 01:20:03.267
MATT: This is from Lissey Loredio. This is-- oh,
what. This is a canvas print.

01:20:03.267 --> 01:20:04.038
BRIAN and TALIESIN: What?!

01:20:04.038 --> 01:20:05.629
MARISHA: Oh god!

01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:06.560
BRIAN: Careful!

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.946
MARISHA: I almost stepped on a box.

01:20:07.946 --> 01:20:09.999
MATT: That is so neat.

01:20:09.999 --> 01:20:11.988
BRIAN: Wow.

01:20:11.988 --> 01:20:17.714
MATT: It's so fricking cool! (cackling)

01:20:17.714 --> 01:20:19.282
TALIESIN: That's crazy.

01:20:19.282 --> 01:20:20.406
BRIAN: That is awesome.

01:20:20.406 --> 01:20:22.014
MATT: Oh my god, I love it.

01:20:22.014 --> 01:20:25.525
MARISHA: Going to have to find a frame for that.

01:20:25.525 --> 01:20:29.680
MATT: Oh, whoa! It's Shawn's Zahra.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.796
BRIAN: Oh, that's dope.

01:20:30.796 --> 01:20:32.664
MARISHA: Are those also on canvases?

01:20:32.664 --> 01:20:33.468
MATT: Yeah.

01:20:33.468 --> 01:20:36.170
MARISHA: That's Zahra with an "h."

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:38.609
MATT: There's one for Will and one for Mary.

01:20:38.609 --> 01:20:39.556
BRIAN: Oh, that's awesome.

01:20:39.556 --> 01:20:40.668
MATT: Make sure that you give one of those when
you go see her.

01:20:40.668 --> 01:20:41.365
BRIAN: I will.

01:20:41.365 --> 01:20:42.395
MATT: Put that there.

01:20:42.395 --> 01:20:43.216
MARISHA: Those are sick.

01:20:43.216 --> 01:20:44.669
MATT: These are so amazing!

01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:45.834
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

01:20:45.834 --> 01:20:48.194
MATT: Holy shit, thank you so much Lacey! Thank
you!

01:20:48.194 --> 01:20:49.209
MARISHA: Lacey!

01:20:49.209 --> 01:20:51.373
TALIESIN: I'm having trouble opening this.

01:20:51.373 --> 01:20:58.082
MATT: That's so badass. I'm going to get the other
one to Will.

01:20:58.082 --> 01:20:59.027
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:20:59.027 --> 01:21:02.799
BRIAN: Do you guys even have enough walls between
your collective homes?

01:21:02.799 --> 01:21:04.193
TALIESIN: Well.

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:05.330
MATT: We're working on it.

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:11.325
TALIESIN: I own a lot of art and so the thing we
do is we shuffle things out so we actually, every

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:16.638
six months, change out the walls a little bit and
move everything around. It's what you do when you

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:20.379
get to a certain point where you have a lot of art
in your life. It's time to shuffle every now and then.

01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:22.238
BRIAN: That's what I do. I shuffle.

01:21:22.238 --> 01:21:28.049
TALIESIN: I have one right here. Also, if there's
anything to open this with. This is too hard to

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.456
open, and I don't quite know what to do.

01:21:29.456 --> 01:21:31.085
MATT: Why are you so bad at opening things?

01:21:31.085 --> 01:21:31.930
TALIESIN: I don't know!

01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:37.975
MATT: Taliesin, the library Internet. Don't
embarrass me!

01:21:37.975 --> 01:21:40.163
BRIAN: Is that a new TV?

01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:41.297
MATT: What?

01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:43.835
MARISHA: Huh?

01:21:43.835 --> 01:21:46.495
BRIAN: I love your guys' house so much.

01:21:46.495 --> 01:21:47.998
MATT: It's coming together.

01:21:47.998 --> 01:21:52.905
BRIAN: It's coming together so beautifully. It's a
perfect mix between both of your personalities and

01:21:52.905 --> 01:21:58.072
lifestyles and interests, with a little bit of
weirdness.

01:21:58.072 --> 01:21:59.245
MATT: A little?

01:21:59.245 --> 01:22:02.030
BRIAN: "Don't trust Matt with the box cutter."

01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:05.093
MATT: "I've never mailed my Shrinky Dinks before,
hopefully they made it okay."

01:22:05.093 --> 01:22:06.450
TALIESIN: (chuckling) I love Shrinky Dinks.

01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:08.013
MATT: "If not, Super Glue fixes them up."

01:22:08.013 --> 01:22:11.029
MARISHA: Shwinky Dinks.

01:22:11.029 --> 01:22:20.838
MATT: This is from Liz Wooden or sithkitten5 on
Twitter. "Dear everyone, about nine years ago my

01:22:20.838 --> 01:22:24.370
"husband asked our group to start playing D&D
together on the weekends. I was reluctant at

01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:26.840
"first, but I fell in love with it and everything
about the game. I played a lot of wonderful

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.797
"characters over the years and unleashed the
creativity I thought I'd lost. Along the way, I

01:22:30.797 --> 01:22:33.774
"started looking at other ways to get my D&D fix,
and when we weren't campaigning, the search

01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:36.996
"eventually led me to Critical Role. Can't watch
the show live, but thanks to the Internet, I'm

01:22:36.996 --> 01:22:40.048
"able to listen to the Monday upload during my
lunch and planning the sessions at work."

01:22:40.048 --> 01:22:40.655
MARISHA: Heck yeah.

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:43.966
MATT: "I'm an occupational therapist that works at
a private school for kids with autism."

01:22:43.966 --> 01:22:45.566
BRIAN: That's awesome.

01:22:45.566 --> 01:22:49.234
MATT: "The simplest way I explain my job is that I
help these young men and women become as

01:22:49.234 --> 01:22:52.674
"independent as possible and give them sensory
strategies to help them cope with day-to-day life.

01:22:52.674 --> 01:22:56.500
"My kids run through the entirety of the autism
spectrum. Some of them are working on typing

01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:00.116
"paragraphs while some are completely non-verbal
and working on life skills like washing their

01:23:00.116 --> 01:23:04.210
"hands. It's a rewarding job, but it's also very
tough. Progress with these kids is often three

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:07.353
"steps forward, two steps back, but it's also not
uncommon when these kids get frustrated or hurt

01:23:07.353 --> 01:23:10.682
"themselves or get aggressive towards staff
members. I've gotten my share of bruises, bites,

01:23:10.682 --> 01:23:16.537
"and scratches in the name of helping them live as
full a life as possible." That's an incredible pursuit.

01:23:16.537 --> 01:23:18.075
MARISHA: Yeah, that is.

01:23:18.075 --> 01:23:20.320
MATT: "Again, thank you for letting us watch each
week. Your adventures have been able to cheer me

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:24.162
"up, even the hardest days at work. That means the
world to me. Episodes were also a lifesaver when

01:23:24.162 --> 01:23:27.285
"my son was a newborn. 2AM feedings were much
easier to handle when I knew I had you guys to

01:23:27.285 --> 01:23:31.816
"keep the two of us company. I look forward to
every episode and even got my husband to watch

01:23:31.816 --> 01:23:38.997
it." Aww. "Our gaming group has never had much
money, so we've always had to improvise. We design

01:23:38.997 --> 01:23:42.062
"our characters using an online generator and I
take those designs and draw them onto Shrinky Dink

01:23:42.062 --> 01:23:45.901
"pages. Then use my Shrinky Dinks as map pieces."
That's awesome!

01:23:45.901 --> 01:23:47.241
MARISHA: That is super smart.

01:23:47.241 --> 01:23:51.663
MATT: There's a bunch here for everyone. Ashley,
Sam, Liam, Laura, Travis, Taliesin.

01:23:51.663 --> 01:23:54.021
TALIESIN: Aw, man I used to love Shrinky Dinks
when I was a kid.

01:23:54.021 --> 01:23:57.061
BRIAN: Are you using a safety pin to try and open
that tube?

01:23:57.061 --> 01:23:58.198
TALIESIN: Don't judge me.

01:23:58.198 --> 01:24:01.246
BRIAN: I'm not judging, I'm just questioning the
efficiency.

01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:07.108
TALIESIN: Just making a point here. Making a
point.

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:11.303
BRIAN: They said, "Someone get Taliesin a
blowtorch. Someone get Taliesin a can opener."

01:24:11.303 --> 01:24:14.622
TALIESIN: I was actually trying to open it right
from the wrong side and I finally figured that out.

01:24:14.622 --> 01:24:17.211
BRIAN: John Dylan's asked if Matt got the kitchen
bench done.

01:24:17.211 --> 01:24:19.618
MATT: Not yet. That's the next endeavor.

01:24:19.618 --> 01:24:22.616
MARISHA: This looks like it's for you, Matt.

01:24:22.616 --> 01:24:23.946
TALIESIN: Ah! That's adorable.

01:24:23.946 --> 01:24:25.751
MARISHA: Aw, yeah!

01:24:25.751 --> 01:24:28.099
MATT: It's my little Gilmore.

01:24:28.099 --> 01:24:29.529
MARISHA: Oh my gosh!

01:24:29.529 --> 01:24:31.683
MATT: Little Gilmore.

01:24:31.683 --> 01:24:33.403
BRIAN: Yes, that's dope!

01:24:33.403 --> 01:24:42.261
TALIESIN: The base is really solid, holy cow. Why
is this reminding me of-- what was that game?

01:24:42.261 --> 01:24:44.125
MATT: Thank you so much, Liz, these are amazing!

01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:46.583
TALIESIN: This is awesome. It's going to be safe
up here for now.

01:24:47.279 --> 01:24:48.366
BRIAN: Oh my gosh!

01:24:48.366 --> 01:24:53.835
MARISHA: These are so cute! It's also such a good
idea to use Shrinky Dinks.

01:24:53.835 --> 01:24:59.232
MATT: This is from-- oh shit.

01:24:59.232 --> 01:25:04.307
BRIAN: Roll dex for package-opening efficiency.

01:25:04.307 --> 01:25:05.181
MATT: Yeah, I know.

01:25:05.181 --> 01:25:12.057
BRIAN: DanConnolly19 says, "Please tell them I
love them, that is all."

01:25:12.057 --> 01:25:15.386
MATT and MARISHA: Aw, love you too, Dan!

01:25:15.386 --> 01:25:17.123
BRIAN: Dan meant it for me.

01:25:17.123 --> 01:25:24.810
MARISHA: So cute! It's my second season outfit,
too!

01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:25.592
BRIAN: Let's see.

01:25:25.592 --> 01:25:27.248
TALIESIN: I love the second season outfits.

01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:29.836
BRIAN: Yes! That's awesome.

01:25:29.836 --> 01:25:33.035
MARISHA: I can't wait for my third season outfit.

01:25:33.035 --> 01:25:38.673
TALIESIN: I know. I was imagining when your hair
got burned, I was imagining Kit at home going, "Ah!"

01:25:38.673 --> 01:25:39.820
MARISHA: "Oh my god!"

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.620
BRIAN: Yeah, right.

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.151
TALIESIN: Just screaming.

01:25:42.151 --> 01:25:46.752
MARISHA: I'm pretty stoked about my hair change,
not going to lie.

01:25:46.752 --> 01:25:49.898
TALIESIN: This is from Faith in Baltimore. Okay,
Faith. Oh dear.

01:25:49.898 --> 01:25:51.052
BRIAN: Oh, you got it open!

01:25:51.052 --> 01:25:57.136
MARISHA: Oh my gosh! Oh, dude, Tal.

01:25:57.136 --> 01:26:01.483
TALIESIN: Oh, and there's the letter. Oh yeah.

01:26:01.483 --> 01:26:02.831
BRIAN: Wow.

01:26:02.831 --> 01:26:03.530
TALIESIN: Very nice.

01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:04.049
BRIAN: That is beautiful.

01:26:04.049 --> 01:26:05.062
TALIESIN: And--

01:26:05.062 --> 01:26:09.131
MARISHA: (gasp) Is that-- What is it? Is it a
little Clarota?

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:15.191
BRIAN: I don't know how people do this. That seems
so hard. And you have to have patience, which is

01:26:15.191 --> 01:26:17.010
dumb. I don't have any of that.

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:18.230
MARISHA: It's the patience thing.

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:24.029
BRIAN: "Will Ashley be here this week?" I don't
think so, no. Unfortunately, she's on ABC's

01:26:24.029 --> 01:26:26.970
Blindside, and they film 24/7.

01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:34.800
MATT: Syler Scotshear, I got your letter, and a
sincere, "Thank you so much." I'm glad you're

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.755
journeying along with us and hold tight out there
in Ohio. I know it can get weird.

01:26:40.755 --> 01:26:51.823
TALIESIN: Oh, Faye, thank you so much. Thank you.
Box cutter? Oh. I was like, "Is this a new thing?"

01:26:51.823 --> 01:26:56.896
MATT: This is a wonderful Scanlan shirt. "I work
for the customs department. My name is Burt

01:26:56.896 --> 01:27:02.180
Reynolds." Which is in reference to a pre-stream
episode that we have in our short pre-stream

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.874
trailer that Ashley put together.

01:27:03.874 --> 01:27:05.145
TALIESIN: His early Burt Reynolds.

01:27:05.145 --> 01:27:05.847
MARISHA: That's right.

01:27:05.847 --> 01:27:07.461
MATT: That's awesome. Thank you so much, Syler.

01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:11.317
MARISHA: Yeah, Ashley edited together our first
sizzle.

01:27:11.317 --> 01:27:14.148
TALIESIN: and BRIAN: That's right.

01:27:14.148 --> 01:27:15.248
MATT: Yeah, and O Fortuna.

01:27:15.248 --> 01:27:15.965
MARISHA: Yep.

01:27:15.965 --> 01:27:18.245
TALIESIN: That thing was so ridiculous.

01:27:18.245 --> 01:27:21.852
MARISHA: It was awesome. She whipped it out in a
day, too.

01:27:21.852 --> 01:27:26.599
MATT: She's good, man. Someone better lock her
down.

01:27:26.599 --> 01:27:28.048
MARISHA: I know, she's our bae.

01:27:28.048 --> 01:27:29.333
TALIESIN: Yeah, seriously.

01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:29.851
BRIAN: No.

01:27:29.851 --> 01:27:34.315
(laughter)

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:35.860
BRIAN: She's holding out for some rich guy.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:40.333
TALIESIN: It's smart on her part, really.

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:41.758
MATT: Yeah, to be fair.

01:27:41.758 --> 01:27:50.732
BRIAN: People are asking if our home DMed game is
going to be streamed. No, outside of Will and

01:27:51.009 --> 01:27:52.182
Mary, we're all noobs.

01:27:52.182 --> 01:27:57.045
MATT: Not all games should be streamed. That's,
for many of them, their first time playing, let

01:27:57.045 --> 01:28:02.064
them enjoy the experience privately and don't push
them too hard, guys. Let them enjoy their game.

01:28:02.064 --> 01:28:08.480
BRIAN: We'll definitely post some pictures and
videos, but we're definitely going to get our feet

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.172
wet. What does that term mean? Walking out to the
ocean to test the water?

01:28:13.172 --> 01:28:14.412
TALIESIN: Getting into the pool first.

01:28:14.412 --> 01:28:15.136
BRIAN: Okay.

01:28:15.136 --> 01:28:19.023
MATT: But yeah, don't bother them about it, guys.
Let them have their private game.

01:28:19.023 --> 01:28:20.958
BRIAN: Oh, it's fine. People just want more of me,
Matt.

01:28:20.958 --> 01:28:21.764
MARISHA: That's true.

01:28:21.764 --> 01:28:23.085
TALIESIN: That is very fair.

01:28:23.085 --> 01:28:30.992
MATT: Oh, this is to Liam O'Brien, courtesy of
CoolStuffTommeggle. I don't know who it's from,

01:28:30.992 --> 01:28:32.437
but I'll make sure this gets to Liam.

01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:38.799
BRIAN: Can we talk about how great his beard is,
how perfectly shaped and shaded and colored it is?

01:28:38.799 --> 01:28:40.470
MATT: I know what he's growing it for.

01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:41.358
BRIAN: Can you say?

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:42.045
MATT: No.

01:28:42.045 --> 01:28:42.799
BRIAN: I can't either.

01:28:42.799 --> 01:28:44.013
MATT: But you guys'll be excited.

01:28:44.013 --> 01:28:46.674
TALIESIN: I don't know what for either.

01:28:46.674 --> 01:28:48.100
MATT: I do, it's awesome.

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:51.167
BRIAN: He's going to play Abe Lincoln in a video
game where you--

01:28:51.167 --> 01:28:52.881
MATT: They had to mocap the beard.

01:28:52.881 --> 01:28:54.277
BRIAN: Yeah, they had to mocap the beard.

01:28:54.277 --> 01:28:56.308
TALIESIN: It's coming out, it's called Four
Score.

01:28:56.308 --> 01:28:59.117
MATT: (announcer voice) Four Score.

01:28:59.117 --> 01:29:04.588
TALIESIN: It's kind of like Gods of War vibe,
except with Lincoln.

01:29:04.588 --> 01:29:07.660
MATT: (Kratos voice) Emancipator! (speaking) It'd
be great.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:12.650
BRIAN: (Kratos voice) Let freedom ring! (speaking)
I've been playing Overwatch on PC and it changed

01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:13.286
my life.

01:29:13.286 --> 01:29:14.394
MATT: Yeah, it does that.

01:29:14.394 --> 01:29:18.426
BRIAN: It is so much better! I didn't realize how
much lag was on the console until I started

01:29:18.426 --> 01:29:19.541
playing on PC.

01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:20.708
TALIESIN: Oh, this is for Mary!

01:29:20.708 --> 01:29:21.825
MATT: Another one for Mary.

01:29:21.825 --> 01:29:24.271
BRIAN: What's this? What's happening over here?

01:29:24.271 --> 01:29:26.598
MARISHA: Okay, this is from Jared Hayes.

01:29:26.598 --> 01:29:28.496
BRIAN: Where did Dagon go?

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:32.331
MARISHA: Back to her cage. Right? I took her back,
right?

01:29:32.331 --> 01:29:35.661
BRIAN: I was like, "Oh no." Everybody's asking,
I'm like, "Oh no, did I sit on her?"

01:29:35.661 --> 01:29:42.833
MARISHA: Yeah, she's in her cage. I questioned it
for a second. "To my favorite group of nerdy-ass

01:29:42.833 --> 01:29:46.191
"voice actors: As a token of my appreciation for

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:57.355
"quest. Dice bags are usually the go-to, but in my
opinion, mail dice bags look like used metal condoms--"

01:29:57.355 --> 01:29:59.952
TALIESIN: If you do them right. Sorry.

01:29:59.952 --> 01:30:07.964
MARISHA: "So instead, I decided to skip the bag
part and straight up make you some chainmail dice.

01:30:07.964 --> 01:30:13.560
"The colors for each dice were chosen specifically
with your characters in mind. The rings are

hypoallergenic polyester. These dice were not fair

01:30:26.258 --> 01:30:29.438
"and not in a helpful, don't-let-Matt-know kind of
way, either."

01:30:29.438 --> 01:30:29.914
MATT: What?

01:30:29.914 --> 01:30:34.754
MARISHA: Nothing. "Even if you can't use them in
game, I hope you enjoy these dice as much as I

01:30:34.754 --> 01:30:44.841
"have enjoyed Critical Role. All the best, Jared
Hayes @jrphayes. P.S., I'm glad people have

cookie Kit Kats can be baked in the toaster oven

"for two to two and a half minutes."

01:30:59.866 --> 01:31:00.720
BRIAN: Give me those.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.393
MATT: What? This is-- what?

01:31:02.393 --> 01:31:04.414
BRIAN: I'm leaving with those at once.

01:31:04.414 --> 01:31:06.707
MATT: What the-- what?

01:31:06.707 --> 01:31:09.088
BRIAN: Oh!

01:31:09.088 --> 01:31:13.094
MARISHA: Japanese Kit Kat! Can you do it again?
Two for two?

01:31:13.094 --> 01:31:16.071
BRIAN: I sure can. Oh!

01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:17.476
MARISHA: Look, that was not on me!

01:31:17.476 --> 01:31:19.434
MATT: Make a constitution save versus diabetes,
guys.

01:31:19.434 --> 01:31:20.108
MARISHA: You guys.

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:21.545
BRIAN: These are Japanese Kit Kats?

01:31:21.545 --> 01:31:22.826
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a whole--

01:31:22.826 --> 01:31:26.256
MARISHA: Look at these! This is Pike's die.

01:31:26.256 --> 01:31:28.936
BRIAN: Oh my gosh.

01:31:28.936 --> 01:31:31.528
MARISHA: This one's Scanlan's. These are so cool!

01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:33.628
BRIAN: What the heck? This is so awesome!

01:31:33.628 --> 01:31:34.868
MARISHA: These are Percy's!

01:31:34.868 --> 01:31:35.626
TALIESIN: Thank you, oh.

01:31:35.626 --> 01:31:40.801
MATT: By the way, Tristan, I got your letter and
your awesome dice bag accouterment there, which is

01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:42.137
awesome. Thank you so much.

01:31:42.137 --> 01:31:45.213
MARISHA: Here's the DM's. Sorry, I did not mean to
do that.

01:31:45.213 --> 01:31:46.016
MATT: Oh, did you?

01:31:46.016 --> 01:31:46.643
MARISHA: I didn't.

01:31:46.643 --> 01:31:48.915
MATT: That's so cool. Thank you, Tristan!

01:31:48.915 --> 01:31:50.008
MARISHA: This is Vex.

01:31:50.008 --> 01:31:52.768
TALIESIN: This feels weirdly, now that I'm
thinking about that--

01:31:52.768 --> 01:31:54.391
BRIAN: These are so cool!

01:31:54.391 --> 01:31:55.738
TALIESIN: Yeah, these are.

01:31:55.738 --> 01:31:57.480
BRIAN: Squishy squishy.

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:05.611
MARISHA: Here's Travis's. This is mine. Oh, it's
Air Ashari colors!

01:32:05.611 --> 01:32:07.477
BRIAN: A green tea Kit Kat?

01:32:07.477 --> 01:32:08.580
TALIESIN: Oh, those are great!

01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.863
MATT: Have you ever had those? Those are
fantastic.

01:32:09.863 --> 01:32:10.835
TALIESIN: You're in for a treat.

01:32:10.835 --> 01:32:11.922
MATT: Yes, you are, sir.

01:32:11.922 --> 01:32:16.366
BRIAN: What? Oh shit, sorry, I got distracted by
cookie and my video failed.

01:32:16.366 --> 01:32:17.063
MATT: It does that.

01:32:17.063 --> 01:32:25.238
BRIAN: I'm going to send a picture of this to Ash
tonight. She's going to love it. Pike. I love this.

01:32:25.238 --> 01:32:29.858
MATT: Congratulations on the engagement, long live
the Marishatt Merceray.

01:32:30.577 --> 01:32:31.988
MARISHA: Marishatt for life.

01:32:31.988 --> 01:32:33.445
MATT: Marishatt Merceray.

01:32:33.445 --> 01:32:40.576
BRIAN: I would love some candy for our game.
That's so sweet of you. You see that one? That's

01:32:40.576 --> 01:32:42.726
dope. Oh, that's so cool!

01:32:42.726 --> 01:32:44.003
MATT: There are numbers on it too, I love it!

01:32:44.003 --> 01:32:44.679
BRIAN: That's so cool!

01:32:44.679 --> 01:32:46.062
TALIESIN: It's very soothing.

01:32:46.062 --> 01:32:46.650
MATT: Yeah.

01:32:46.650 --> 01:32:51.802
BRIAN: Is there any wasabi Kit Kat? What are you
guys talking, wasabi Kit Kat?

01:32:51.802 --> 01:32:53.705
MATT: They do have wasabi.

01:32:53.705 --> 01:33:03.122
BRIAN: Which ones are these? I can't read Japanese
anymore. There's these ones. And there's these ones.

01:33:03.677 --> 01:33:08.025
TALIESIN: This is from Amanda Clark in Caldwell.

01:33:08.025 --> 01:33:15.634
MATT: (singing) I'm knocking out a Thermos for
you. An ordinary Thermos, for you.

01:33:15.634 --> 01:33:19.040
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to have to open this up
very carefully because this is nuts.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.311
MATT: Or it'll detonate?

01:33:20.311 --> 01:33:23.803
BRIAN: Bye NCTross, her phone's going to die. Bye,
we love you.

01:33:23.803 --> 01:33:25.275
ALL: Bye!

01:33:25.275 --> 01:33:26.207
BRIAN: Watch this later.

01:33:26.207 --> 01:33:27.420
TALIESIN: Queue it up later.

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.425
MATT: Critical Scope's on it probably.

01:33:30.425 --> 01:33:35.155
TALIESIN: Holy cow. This is a 3D card.

01:33:35.155 --> 01:33:37.166
BRIAN: That is dope.

01:33:37.166 --> 01:33:38.208
MARISHA: That's a 3D-printed card?

01:33:38.208 --> 01:33:42.420
TALIESIN: It's not 3D-printed, it's a 3D card. As
I shake too much because--

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:44.893
MATT: Whoa! Oh, that's amazing! Is that Bad News
in there?

01:33:44.893 --> 01:33:45.497
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:33:45.497 --> 01:33:47.441
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's the inside of
Whitestone!

01:33:47.441 --> 01:33:48.177
BRIAN: That's cool.

01:33:48.177 --> 01:33:57.635
TALIESIN: It's a birthday card! Oh my god, thank
you! It is my birthday in a few days. Aw, you know

01:33:57.635 --> 01:33:58.690
me, thank you so much!

01:33:58.690 --> 01:34:01.440
MARISHA: Wait, what are these?

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.611
TALIESIN: I am very-- this is awesome. Thank you.

01:34:04.611 --> 01:34:07.469
MARISHA: Are those stanzas?

01:34:07.469 --> 01:34:08.855
MATT: I think it stanzas for them, yeah.

01:34:08.855 --> 01:34:12.932
BRIAN: LidaPhoenix says, "Making dinner, watching
you nerds, getting ready for D&D." That sounds

01:34:12.932 --> 01:34:14.608
like a good Saturday night!

01:34:14.608 --> 01:34:16.010
MARISHA: Hell, yeah!

01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:18.699
BRIAN: Is it Saturday? That sounds like a good
Saturday night.

01:34:18.699 --> 01:34:19.535
MARISHA: Isn't that crazy?

01:34:19.535 --> 01:34:24.832
MATT: This is from WilyTouchstone, Craig Tryhurst
sent in, "Dear Matthew, I wish to express my new

01:34:24.832 --> 01:34:28.647
"appreciation and admiration for your skills as a
gamemaster and a storyteller from Critical Role,

01:34:28.647 --> 01:34:32.581
"Force Grey and other projects." Thank you. "Many
people who begin as gamemasters underestimate the

01:34:32.581 --> 01:34:35.615
"demands of the role and the breadths of skills
required to run an enjoyable game, much less to

01:34:35.615 --> 01:34:37.367
"those who try to craft a compelling narrative--"

01:34:37.367 --> 01:34:38.281
TALIESIN: Eh, that shit's easy.

01:34:38.281 --> 01:34:47.772
MATT: It's time-consuming, but with practice,
anyone can be awesome at this. Find your own style.

01:34:47.772 --> 01:34:49.404
TALIESIN: Thank you for this amazing card.

01:34:49.404 --> 01:34:51.659
BRIAN: Caffeine, Katie. I saw that.

01:34:51.659 --> 01:34:53.122
MARISHA: What is this? Oh, is this from her?

01:34:53.122 --> 01:34:57.067
TALIESIN: No, that's from Tristan.

01:34:57.067 --> 01:34:59.277
MARISHA: Tristan!

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:02.652
MATT: Yeah, the awesome charm. It can go on your
dice bag.

01:35:02.652 --> 01:35:05.715
MARISHA: Yeah! They bought us dice bags?

01:35:05.715 --> 01:35:08.272
TALIESIN: Thank you for the cards.

01:35:08.272 --> 01:35:10.896
MARISHA: These are sick.

01:35:10.896 --> 01:35:14.828
BRIAN: "Brian, can you ask Matt what brand was
that watch he got on Talks Machina Critmas, that

01:35:14.828 --> 01:35:19.040
"epic--" what's it called? Oh, crap.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.175
MARISHA: What was the brand of that?

01:35:20.175 --> 01:35:21.373
MATT: I'd have to look at it.

01:35:21.373 --> 01:35:24.876
BRIAN: It's on the tip of my--

01:35:24.876 --> 01:35:27.711
MARISHA: I know, I'm drawing a blank-- Helvetica!
Right?

01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:29.343
ALL: No.

01:35:29.343 --> 01:35:30.289
MARISHA: That's a font.

01:35:30.289 --> 01:35:31.200
MATT: Yeah, it is.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.613
BRIAN: Have you been spending a lot of time in
Microsoft Word lately?

01:35:35.613 --> 01:35:41.162
MATT: Yeah. I have it on my phone, which you're
holding, so I'll figure it out later. It says,

01:35:41.162 --> 01:35:46.524
"Normally I would not dare--" Oh, okay. "I feel
like-- the one force that I've come across that

01:35:46.524 --> 01:35:49.925
"transcends simple chance would be the embodiment
of true elemental chaos. I've used this implement

01:35:49.925 --> 01:35:53.560
"in my own past games. My players came to regard it
with reverence and dread. One ill-fated player

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.248
"even cursed it as evil incarnate."

01:35:55.248 --> 01:35:56.706
BRIAN: Invictus.

01:35:56.706 --> 01:35:58.874
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Invictus.

01:35:58.874 --> 01:36:00.159
BRIAN: Invictus. Sorry.

01:36:00.159 --> 01:36:06.304
MATT: Invictus, which I'm pretty sure was one of
the things you shout in the old Ultima Online when

01:36:06.304 --> 01:36:10.708
you use a spell. "For this very reason they've
secured it with this reliquary, bound and warded.

01:36:10.708 --> 01:36:13.273
"If you have faith in your players, it may bring
your narrative to new heights or set them adrift

01:36:13.273 --> 01:36:17.709
"upon a sea of paranoia. The choice is yours, or at
the very least, Laura has a new swanky dice jail."

01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:23.376
BRIAN: "Hey Brian, can you ask Matt and Marisha if
they have opened from last Critmas Thanksgiving?"

01:36:23.376 --> 01:36:23.895
I will.

01:36:23.895 --> 01:36:26.966
MATT: Oh, I love it! It's chained shut with
sealing papers on it!

01:36:26.966 --> 01:36:36.023
TALIESIN: (chuckling) This is the most evil thing
ever! Oh my god, you're a terrible person. This is

01:36:36.023 --> 01:36:44.886
amazing. I love it! Oh, this is the worst thing
ever. I'm so excited! (cackling)

01:36:44.886 --> 01:36:46.508
BRIAN: Bye ChimeraWhimsy, we love you!

01:36:46.508 --> 01:36:48.803
MARISHA: Thank you, Tristan!

01:36:48.803 --> 01:36:50.909
MATT: I legitimately have to get a pair of
pliers.

01:36:50.909 --> 01:36:58.585
TALIESIN: Okay, this is-- where-- okay. What?
Okay, check out--

01:36:58.585 --> 01:37:00.945
BRIAN: Invicta, not Invictus.

01:37:00.945 --> 01:37:03.044
MATT: Deutsche Post.

01:37:03.044 --> 01:37:11.772
TALIESIN: Oh yes. So this comes from Germany. This
is amazing. This is apparently-- this is for me--

01:37:11.772 --> 01:37:19.609
it's from Inja, Inja Morgan on Twitter, who sent
me some chocolates that they made. 19 of them are

01:37:19.609 --> 01:37:25.410
nice and normal, and there's one that represents
the psychic damage I take when Animus misfires,

01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:30.166
and it's spicy hot. And will apparently hurt.

01:37:30.166 --> 01:37:32.308
BRIAN: Whoa.

01:37:32.308 --> 01:37:37.922
TALIESIN: Challenge accepted. Challenge totally
accepted.

01:37:37.922 --> 01:37:41.793
MARISHA: Wait, doesn't that happen on a two or a
one though for Animus?

01:37:42.185 --> 01:37:47.645
TALIESIN: Technically, this is much kinder than
Animus. Oh shit, okay, yeah, that stuff--

01:37:47.645 --> 01:37:49.466
MARISHA: That's amazing.

01:37:49.466 --> 01:37:54.549
MATT: Craig also has a bunch of additional things.
This would be the O'Brien family, the Riegel

01:37:54.549 --> 01:37:56.584
family, the Foster-Johnson family.

01:37:56.584 --> 01:37:57.429
BRIAN: Oh, that's me!

01:37:57.429 --> 01:37:58.302
MATT: That's you.

01:37:58.302 --> 01:38:03.888
BRIAN: I'm of those people. The Foster-Johnson
family.

01:38:03.888 --> 01:38:05.461
MATT: This is the Jaffe family, the Mercer-Ray
family.

01:38:05.461 --> 01:38:06.580
MARISHA: Merceray!

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:12.565
BRIAN: Ryan Green asks if this was the bunch of
stuff he was guarding behind the set or if this is new.

01:38:12.565 --> 01:38:15.391
TALIESIN: There's still some left from that.

01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:19.048
BRIAN: There's still some left, Ryan Green. You
are a handsome son of a bitch.

01:38:19.048 --> 01:38:22.787
MARISHA: Is Ryan Green in chat? Ryan Green.

01:38:22.787 --> 01:38:26.719
BRIAN: Meghan, post your comment again, the chat's
going too fast for me to understand what you're

01:38:26.719 --> 01:38:35.382
asking for. Sorry guys, I'm trying to get to some
of these questions, but the chat moves very quickly.

01:38:35.382 --> 01:38:36.470
MARISHA: It does go fast.

01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:43.484
BRIAN: One of the Critters was asking if you guys
need any furniture for your house. I think they

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:44.340
make furniture.

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.959
TALIESIN: Where are you at?

01:38:46.959 --> 01:38:51.213
BRIAN: Yeah, are you still-- the setup is very
early on right now.

01:38:51.213 --> 01:38:55.323
MATT: Guys, I mean, I don't know.

01:38:55.323 --> 01:38:58.526
TALIESIN: Even I can't ask, I don't know how
they'd answer.

01:38:58.526 --> 01:39:07.889
MATT: It's a strange position because on one hand,
we're doing okay and we're busy people, things are

01:39:07.889 --> 01:39:13.764
going okay for the time being career-wise, so we
have a hard time accepting gifts, per se, but we

01:39:13.764 --> 01:39:19.214
appreciate all that you guys do for us. There's so
much heart put into each of these things and we've

01:39:19.214 --> 01:39:23.134
incorporated them all into our living space, so
it's this tradeoff. You don't have to do anything

01:39:23.134 --> 01:39:28.095
by any means! If you feel inspired and you want
to, then go for it, and we'll find a place for it.

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:28.958
I don't know.

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:33.424
BRIAN: Yeah. That's a great answer.

01:39:33.424 --> 01:39:38.636
MATT: Having to learn through the years how to
accept gifts, it's a weird process. I'm

01:39:38.636 --> 01:39:43.257
appreciative of all the wonderful people, that for
some reason, follow along with our chaos.

01:39:43.257 --> 01:39:44.636
TALIESIN: Oh, that's just wonderfully cruel.

01:39:44.636 --> 01:39:50.578
MARISHA: It's an audio version of the Christmas
Carol.

01:39:50.578 --> 01:39:53.651
MATT: What? Performed by Craig?

01:39:53.651 --> 01:39:57.052
MARISHA: By Craig Tyhurst.

01:39:57.052 --> 01:39:59.568
MATT: Yeah, adapted and performed by Craig
himself. That's awesome!

01:39:59.568 --> 01:40:02.032
MARISHA: That is so awesome! That's such a good
idea!

01:40:02.032 --> 01:40:03.533
TALIESIN: I am down for that.

01:40:03.533 --> 01:40:06.929
BRIAN: "Did Matt and Marisha open from last
Critmas after Thanksgiving?"

01:40:06.929 --> 01:40:08.050
MATT: What's what?

01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:16.076
BRIAN: Meghan was asking if Matt and Marisha
opened from the Critmas from last Thanksgiving.

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:18.447
MATT: We had a Critmas last time.

01:40:18.447 --> 01:40:21.210
MARISHA: Yeah, we opened those. We got you, girl.

01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:23.713
BRIAN: Yeah, they opened those. Don't apologize to
me!

01:40:23.713 --> 01:40:29.663
TALIESIN: Every now and then, things get a little
crazy, and not everything ends up on stream. Not

01:40:29.663 --> 01:40:32.487
everything is up on stream. But we pretend.

01:40:32.487 --> 01:40:33.535
MARISHA: But we try.

01:40:33.535 --> 01:40:34.963
TALIESIN: Because this is crazy.

01:40:34.963 --> 01:40:38.853
BRIAN: Question. "How many times does everyone
watch the 'What Does Critical Role Mean to You?' video?"

01:40:38.853 --> 01:40:42.061
MARISHA: We've watched it a few times.

01:40:42.061 --> 01:40:46.024
BRIAN: I've watched every video that every person
sent in multiple times.

01:40:46.024 --> 01:40:47.693
TALIESIN: Plus some ones that people didn't add.

01:40:47.693 --> 01:40:49.071
MATT: You didn't open this big box.

01:40:49.071 --> 01:40:50.349
TALIESIN: I know, I'm getting to it after all
that.

01:40:50.349 --> 01:40:54.274
BRIAN: Tovath, send me a link to that on Twitter
if you don't mind, @brianwfoster. Are you guys

01:40:54.274 --> 01:40:56.060
heading to Australia this year, anyone?

01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.024
MATT: I don't know.

01:40:57.024 --> 01:40:58.013
MARISHA: Maybe.

01:40:58.013 --> 01:41:00.241
TALIESIN: We just started looking at that.

01:41:00.241 --> 01:41:03.798
MATT: We're getting to the bigger boxes here. We
have a couple--

01:41:03.798 --> 01:41:06.590
TALIESIN: There's still some stuff in the tub that
we should look at.

01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:08.324
MATT: Oh yes, bring that over. Marisha and I will
pull some stuff.

01:41:08.324 --> 01:41:10.747
BRIAN: Marisha, have you ever had short hair in
real life?

01:41:10.747 --> 01:41:18.977
MARISHA: It's been shoulder-length a long time
ago, and that was the shortest it's ever been.

01:41:18.977 --> 01:41:26.652
I've never done a bob, I've never been Keyleth
short, like chin-length. I've never gone

01:41:26.652 --> 01:41:28.196
chin-length before.

01:41:28.196 --> 01:41:34.165
BRIAN: We are going to release the full-length
form of that video. It's taking a while because a

01:41:34.165 --> 01:41:40.482
lot of them were in really different formats. We
have some editors that are working on it, but I

01:41:40.482 --> 01:41:45.840
promise you guys I'll let you know as soon as we
get that done. There's so much going on right now,

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.984
but everybody's working on it as much as they can.
Thank you guys for being patient.

01:41:49.984 --> 01:41:52.517
MARISHA: (in a British accent) There's been a lot
going on over there at good old Geek & Sundry.

01:41:52.517 --> 01:41:55.550
MATT: I got your specific letter, Amanda, by the
way, to go along with the brass dragon. Thank you

01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:58.776
so much. I'm going to read the full thing later
on.

01:41:58.776 --> 01:42:02.824
BRIAN: "Please come to Canada, we love you up
here." I love Canada. Canada's freaking beautiful.

01:42:02.824 --> 01:42:11.316
MATT: Canada's great! We haven't been to any of
the major cities yet. We went to Nova Scotia for a

01:42:11.316 --> 01:42:13.547
store opening up there. It was really fun, really
pretty up there.

01:42:13.547 --> 01:42:14.550
MARISHA: In Halifax.

01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:18.653
BRIAN: "Please come back to New York City." Oh,
I'm going to be in New York City soon.

01:42:18.653 --> 01:42:19.654
TALIESIN: We love New York.

01:42:19.654 --> 01:42:21.407
MATT: We're trying to find a way to get back to
New York soon.

01:42:21.407 --> 01:42:25.596
TALIESIN: We have a lot of friends-- actually, the
real Cassandra de Rolo lives in New York.

01:42:25.596 --> 01:42:26.805
MATT: Oh, what?

01:42:26.805 --> 01:42:30.033
TALIESIN: She just found out that I wrote her into
a game. She laughed pretty hard.

01:42:30.033 --> 01:42:34.601
MATT: Chris Moss said, "Critical Role, I've
watched you guys since November. It was nice to

01:42:34.601 --> 01:42:38.284
"binge watch all the back episodes every night and
then get caught up. Sadness. But I have a new

01:42:38.284 --> 01:42:43.194
"goal. While I've been waiting for 'How do you want
to do this?,' I wish I had thought of that one,

01:42:43.194 --> 01:42:48.299
"it's so good. I used to play D&D back in high
school. TSR-80 and Atari were a good time and a

01:42:48.299 --> 01:42:52.295
"brief time while in the First Gulf War, Desert
Shield and Desert Storm." Thank you very much for

01:42:52.295 --> 01:42:53.523
your service, by the way, Chris.

01:42:53.523 --> 01:42:54.015
BRIAN: Awesome.

01:42:54.015 --> 01:42:57.397
MATT: "I was a sergeant in the United States
Marine Corps. Then after that, I got married and

01:42:57.397 --> 01:43:01.434
"had two boys and never got the chance to play
again until you guys came along. I did get into

01:43:01.434 --> 01:43:05.405
"some PC gaming when I had two boys. Now they're
both grown up and on their way to college and I've

01:43:05.405 --> 01:43:08.290
"no time to play, but there was something missing.
After I found you guys at Geek & Sundry, I was

01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:11.791
"going through my D&D suitcase, came across these
books that needed a new home, and I thought of you

01:43:11.791 --> 01:43:15.191
"guys. You guys are bringing a lot of laughs into
my long weeks, and hope to see more. Scoot with

01:43:15.191 --> 01:43:20.949
"the good times. P.S. Sam, you're awesome with
limericks." He is. "And P.S.S., my handwriting is

01:43:20.949 --> 01:43:26.608
"so atrocious, so I typed it." Don't worry about
it, buddy, it's all good. He sent these original

01:43:26.608 --> 01:43:29.836
Dungeons & Dragons books.

01:43:29.836 --> 01:43:31.000
MARISHA: Oh shit, like TSR books?

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:38.761
MATT: Like the original Greyhawk supplement, which
is legit. There's the rules from the Men and Magic

01:43:38.761 --> 01:43:45.221
book. Women weren't allowed apparently in that
one. And the Underworld and Wilderness Adventures.

01:43:45.221 --> 01:43:51.103
Okay guys, those who haven't seen what D&D looked
like in the beginning. Yeah, right there. This is

01:43:51.103 --> 01:43:52.738
what it looked like way back in the day.

01:43:52.738 --> 01:43:55.008
BRIAN: It's about time someone gave men a leg up.

01:43:55.008 --> 01:43:56.712
TALIESIN: A third leg up, even.

01:43:56.712 --> 01:44:02.652
MATT: Heyo. I always loved the older design of the
Beholder. What was the old, sad movie, old

01:44:02.652 --> 01:44:05.564
black-and-white silent films?

01:44:05.564 --> 01:44:08.511
TALIESIN: Or like the weird animated Ms. Pac-Man
with one eye.

01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:15.751
MATT: Yeah. It's beautiful. This is a kingly gift.
Thank you so much. It's from history, yo.

01:44:15.751 --> 01:44:21.991
MARISHA: This is from Lindsey M. from Polk City,
Florida. (in a Southern accent) Polk City, Florida.

01:44:21.991 --> 01:44:23.655
TALIESIN: I don't think I've ever been to Polk
City before.

01:44:23.655 --> 01:44:27.651
MARISHA: To Vox Machina, it says, "Congrats to
Matt and Marisha," on the back.

01:44:27.651 --> 01:44:28.177
MATT: Yay.

01:44:28.177 --> 01:44:30.761
MARISHA: This looks pretty amazing.

01:44:30.761 --> 01:44:31.970
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:32.948
TALIESIN: Ah!

01:44:32.948 --> 01:44:38.784
MARISHA: "Dear Vox Machina, enclosed is a token of
my eternal appreciation and the shenanigans that

01:44:38.784 --> 01:44:43.784
"you bring to the Critters each Thursday. Knitting
is a hobby of mine, and I teach my English

01:44:43.784 --> 01:44:51.150
"students how to make hats and scarves for the
homeless during an after school community program

01:44:51.150 --> 01:44:59.082
"called 'The Neckwits.'" That's awesome! "A few of
my students watch the show and one, at 16, is a DM

01:44:59.082 --> 01:45:06.030
"herself. They were stoked when I told them that I
was crafting gifts for all of you wonderful

01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:13.850
"people. I hope you like them, I've already given
Will Friedle his at a local con. Thank you again

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:22.152
"to your talent, your humor, and your inspiration.
Merry Critmas! #performancematters, #percahlia,

01:45:22.152 --> 01:45:24.433
#iwouldliketoknit, #ravenclawforlife."

01:45:24.433 --> 01:45:27.505
MATT: (chuckling) That's awesome!

01:45:27.837 --> 01:45:37.155
MARISHA: Lindsey from Winter Haven, Florida, and
she knit us Dungeon Master Mercer.

01:45:37.155 --> 01:45:38.654
MATT: Oh, what?

01:45:38.654 --> 01:45:40.166
TALIESIN: Oh, I want to go to a soccer game!

01:45:40.166 --> 01:45:44.986
MARISHA: Scanlan, which has musical notes on it.
Holy shit.

01:45:44.986 --> 01:45:46.084
MATT: That's happening.

01:45:46.084 --> 01:45:51.268
MARISHA: Vex'ahlia, which has the bear paw
prints.

01:45:51.268 --> 01:45:52.687
BRIAN: Oh, that's so dope.

01:45:52.687 --> 01:46:02.683
MARISHA: These are crazy, you guys. Vax'ildan,
which's got "Dagger, dagger, dagger." Keyleth of

01:46:02.683 --> 01:46:07.685
the Air Ashari, that's so funny. She put my whole
title on there.

01:46:07.685 --> 01:46:08.558
MATT: That's fantastic.

01:46:08.558 --> 01:46:09.951
MARISHA: I'm putting this on right now.

01:46:09.951 --> 01:46:12.058
MATT: Percy, take it.

01:46:12.058 --> 01:46:12.989
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm in.

01:46:12.989 --> 01:46:16.060
MARISHA: There's Travis's Grog.

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.588
MATT: This is for Pike, you can bring it to her
while you're over there.

01:46:17.588 --> 01:46:18.536
BRIAN: Oh, that's dope.

01:46:18.536 --> 01:46:19.676
MATT: Aw, damn it.

01:46:19.676 --> 01:46:22.611
BRIAN: Nothing but net.

01:46:22.611 --> 01:46:31.003
MATT: Here is a new Vaxleth fic from Adam
Schwartze.

01:46:31.003 --> 01:46:32.042
MARISHA: Oh, Adam!

01:46:32.042 --> 01:46:34.041
MATT: Tiamat, as you know him.

01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:35.300
MARISHA: Thank you, Tiamat.

01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.470
MATT: That's there for you and Liam, which is
awesome.

01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:38.118
MATT and MARISHA: Thank you.

01:46:38.118 --> 01:46:45.926
BRIAN: Quick lightning round question. Favorite
cartoon as a child? Go. Someone asked. Mine was

01:46:45.926 --> 01:46:46.858
Darkwing Duck.

01:46:46.858 --> 01:46:54.390
MATT: Dude, you beat me to it. It depends on the
era. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had such a big

01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:55.458
impact on my life as a kid.

01:46:55.458 --> 01:46:59.909
TALIESIN: I was a really early anime kid, and I
was watching Saint Seiya. Saint Seiya was a really

01:46:59.909 --> 01:47:03.132
heavy anime, and I got pulled in super early,
though.

01:47:03.132 --> 01:47:07.080
MATT: For me it would be the old Ghostbusters to
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to Darkwing Duck, and

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.103
those are the three that really hit me.

01:47:08.103 --> 01:47:09.376
TALIESIN: Galaxy High, motherfucker.

01:47:09.376 --> 01:47:12.380
MARISHA: I watched the Batman animated series
quite a lot.

01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.379
BRIAN: Oh, I love the Batman series.

01:47:14.379 --> 01:47:18.377
MARISHA: I also watched some X-Men back in the
day, the original X-Men cartoon.

01:47:18.377 --> 01:47:20.094
MATT: I can't pick a favorite, there's too many
good ones!

01:47:20.094 --> 01:47:21.648
BRIAN: Was that the one Steve Blum was in?

01:47:21.648 --> 01:47:22.187
MATT: No.

01:47:22.187 --> 01:47:27.299
TALIESIN: He was in-- I'm trying to remember the
name.

01:47:27.299 --> 01:47:29.463
MATT: Yeah, you see him a little bit in Wolverine
and the X-Men.

01:47:29.463 --> 01:47:37.336
TALIESIN: --make sure that our fan whose name I
cannot use from the Royal Australian Mint, who

01:47:37.336 --> 01:47:40.409
requested to remain anonymous for security
reasons.

01:47:40.409 --> 01:47:41.377
MATT: That's amazing!

01:47:41.377 --> 01:47:42.324
BRIAN: Oh, that's hilarious.

01:47:42.324 --> 01:47:45.531
TALIESIN: --a thank you, and this is just-- yeah.

01:47:45.531 --> 01:47:46.105
MATT: Oh, wow.

01:47:46.105 --> 01:47:47.062
TALIESIN: Yeah, fucking spectacular.

01:47:47.062 --> 01:47:48.034
MARISHA: Is it a coin?

01:47:48.034 --> 01:47:49.962
TALIESIN: It's one of the Navy coins.

01:47:49.962 --> 01:47:50.873
BRIAN: Oh, that's dope.

01:47:50.873 --> 01:47:55.183
TALIESIN: Thank you. This means more than you
can--

01:47:55.183 --> 01:47:56.155
MATT: That's so great!

01:47:56.155 --> 01:48:05.100
TALIESIN: Thank you for your letter, this is
great. And, yeah, for the-- we're--

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:06.074
MATT: Oh, we each got one?!

01:48:06.074 --> 01:48:09.675
TALIESIN: Yeah, we each got one. I know Travis
really will want these.

01:48:09.675 --> 01:48:14.907
BRIAN: "Brian, that is Ashley's hat. Put it back
and see me after class." Gummi Bears!

01:48:14.907 --> 01:48:20.698
ALL: (singing) Gummi Bears, bouncing here and
there and everywhere. High adventures that's

01:48:20.698 --> 01:48:26.503
beyond compare, they are the Gummi Bears. We are
the Gummi Bears!

01:48:26.503 --> 01:48:28.640
BRIAN: Yeah, dude.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.362
MATT: We've lost the Internet.

01:48:29.362 --> 01:48:30.490
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:48:30.490 --> 01:48:38.589
BRIAN: That show introduced us all to drugs. What?
You guys didn't take it that way?

01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:41.216
TALIESIN: I don't want to say introduced.

01:48:41.216 --> 01:48:45.836
MATT: That was one of the many greats in the
Lorenzo Music series. Incredible.

01:48:46.413 --> 01:48:51.750
TALIESIN: Really early work of-- oh god, I'm
blanking. We know a bunch of people who worked on that.

01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:52.686
MATT: Marsden, wasn't it?

01:48:52.686 --> 01:48:56.790
TALIESIN: Marsden, and I want to say it was Tom
Hancock? It was some of his early work, maybe?

01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:59.963
MATT: Really? I know it was one of Jason Marsden's
early works.

01:48:59.963 --> 01:49:02.468
BRIAN: "Facepalm," Ryan Green says after we sang.

01:49:02.468 --> 01:49:03.890
MATT: (chuckling) Good.

01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:07.412
BRIAN: (singing) Don't be jealous that we sing so
good.

01:49:07.412 --> 01:49:11.757
MATT: We have a few big ones left, right? Oh
Marisha, hand me that one on the ground.

01:49:11.757 --> 01:49:13.319
MARISHA: This one here?

01:49:13.319 --> 01:49:14.309
MATT: That one right there, yeah.

01:49:14.309 --> 01:49:15.133
MARISHA: It's heavy.

01:49:15.133 --> 01:49:16.687
MATT and TALIESIN: Is it heavy?

01:49:16.687 --> 01:49:17.361
MARISHA: It's--

01:49:17.361 --> 01:49:19.282
MATT: Oh, what is that?

01:49:19.282 --> 01:49:22.975
MARISHA: It's glass-- ooh, they look like mugs!

01:49:22.975 --> 01:49:24.190
MATT: What?

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:28.201
BRIAN: I have not seen the Gummi song on YouTube,
send it to me, please. Send it to me on Twitter.

01:49:28.201 --> 01:49:32.803
MATT: That is heavy, Jesus. It's from Julian
Hupp.

01:49:32.803 --> 01:49:33.990
MARISHA: Here.

01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:46.236
MATT: Thank you. This is a heavy-ass box. How big
is this son of a bitch?

01:49:46.236 --> 01:49:52.380
BRIAN: Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers! Fuck, I
forgot about that show!

01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:55.102
MATT: (singing) Sometimes, some crimes--

01:49:55.102 --> 01:49:56.855
BRIAN: Gargoyles! I loved Gargoyles.

01:49:56.855 --> 01:49:58.675
MATT: (singing) -- go slipping through the
cracks.

01:49:58.675 --> 01:50:09.583
MARISHA: It's not a cartoon, but I was pretty
obsessed with Wishbone. Does anyone remember Wishbone?

01:50:09.583 --> 01:50:11.712
BRIAN: That sounds really familiar, tell me a
little bit more.

01:50:11.712 --> 01:50:13.273
MATT: (singing) Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip n' Dale.

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.586
MARISHA: You weren't paying attention to my
Wishbone story.

01:50:14.921 --> 01:50:16.071
MATT: I'm not, no, I was singing before you--
(chuckling)

01:50:16.071 --> 01:50:17.662
BRIAN: (singing) Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip n' Dale!

01:50:17.662 --> 01:50:20.609
MATT: (singing) When there's danger, you know I
never fail--

01:50:20.609 --> 01:50:23.783
TALIESIN: I was always sad that my parents
wouldn't take me to Chippendales. Because I felt

01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:25.685
that that would be how I'd want to spend my
birthday.

01:50:25.685 --> 01:50:26.775
BRIAN: Yeah, those were different.

01:50:26.775 --> 01:50:28.954
MARISHA: You know, that was very convoluted as a
kid.

01:50:28.954 --> 01:50:33.388
TALIESIN: Was it convoluted? Yeah, that's true. I
wondered why it was a theme restaurant.

01:50:33.388 --> 01:50:36.007
MARISHA: No, you don't understand, Mom, why can't
I go hang out with Chip and Dale?

01:50:36.007 --> 01:50:38.618
TALIESIN: It seems like the restaurant I'd want to
go to.

01:50:38.618 --> 01:50:49.151
MATT: To be fair, yeah. The day you realize. I
remember there's a time where my parents--

01:50:49.151 --> 01:50:52.380
BRIAN: @brianwfoster. Sorry, I was talking to
them.

01:50:52.778 --> 01:50:56.075
MATT: There was a party they were going to for a
friend's bachelorette party and it was at

01:50:56.075 --> 01:51:00.801
Chippendales, and I heard them say it. I was like,
"What? That's not fair!" And that's when I found out.

01:51:00.801 --> 01:51:03.107
TALIESIN: I was about to say, that sounds like
your mom right there.

01:51:03.107 --> 01:51:08.260
MATT: "Dear cast of Critical Role, I'm not sure I
have as much to say as my wife, but I wanted to

01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:11.210
"explain the gifts. For almost two years now, my
wife's been watching your show and has fallen in

01:51:11.210 --> 01:51:15.608
"love. She has watched through the ups and downs,
not just in our life and campaign. During that

01:51:15.608 --> 01:51:19.878
"time we've helped her through so much, Matt has
pissed her off and brought her back along, which

01:51:19.878 --> 01:51:23.711
"I'm sure a lot of us Critters out there. While I
don't watch as much anymore with her, I do catch

01:51:23.711 --> 01:51:30.545
"the occasional episode and laugh my ass off." Aw,
that's really sweet. It says, "Pass on the

01:51:30.545 --> 01:51:34.309
"family," and it's been a couple of hard years for
both him and his wife, and they've both lost two

01:51:34.309 --> 01:51:40.213
members of their respective families. Before that
one, "To explain the gifts, I wanted to thank you

01:51:40.213 --> 01:51:44.364
"for all you do and wish you all the best of luck
in the future. The gifts you will find 12 mugs

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:48.629
"enclosed in the box. Eight are special for the
main cast. The remaining four are etched with my

01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:52.112
"version of the Vox Machina logo on one side and
Critical Role logo on the other."

01:51:52.112 --> 01:51:52.939
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:57.255
MATT: "These four you're free to give away either
to the crew or as gifts. If you feel they're good

01:51:57.533 --> 01:52:01.005
"enough to auction out for charity, I'd be honored.
Eight of the cast are etched with the Vox Machina

01:52:01.005 --> 01:52:03.151
"logo." Wow. Okay.

01:52:03.151 --> 01:52:03.741
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:52:03.741 --> 01:52:05.532
BRIAN: Who is this from again?

01:52:05.532 --> 01:52:07.693
MATT: This is from Julian Hupp and Crystal Hupp.

01:52:07.693 --> 01:52:08.235
BRIAN: Oh, great.

01:52:08.235 --> 01:52:18.718
MATT: Oh, there's a letter here from Crystal as
well! Oh my god, you guys! Okay, we'll read these

01:52:18.718 --> 01:52:24.445
in a moment. I don't want to run out of time. So
these are-- what?

01:52:24.445 --> 01:52:27.077
TALIESIN: Whoa.

01:52:27.415 --> 01:52:28.483
BRIAN: Holy crap.

01:52:28.483 --> 01:52:29.664
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:52:29.664 --> 01:52:33.861
TALIESIN: Ah! Inevitable pain!

01:52:33.861 --> 01:52:36.693
MARISHA: Oh shit!

01:52:36.693 --> 01:52:41.742
MATT: Pike Trickfoot! What could possibly go wrong
in hitting--

01:52:41.742 --> 01:52:43.286
TALIESIN: This is a perfect--

01:52:43.286 --> 01:52:44.452
MARISHA: It's got a Minxie paw!

01:52:44.452 --> 01:52:45.528
BRIAN: This is dope.

01:52:45.528 --> 01:52:48.812
MATT: Your entire name is on there.

01:52:48.812 --> 01:52:50.227
TALIESIN: Oh, very nice. Oh, yeah.

01:52:50.227 --> 01:52:54.921
MATT: These are so cool! Holy shit!

01:52:54.921 --> 01:52:57.864
BRIAN: Wow. Pike Trickfoot. These are so dope.

01:52:57.864 --> 01:53:01.929
TALIESIN: (singing) Who controls the British
crown? Who keeps the metric system down? We do.

01:53:01.929 --> 01:53:04.872
(speaking) Okay, that's enough.

01:53:04.872 --> 01:53:06.390
MATT: Yeah, we're going to have to celebrate with
those in the future.

01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:07.172
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

01:53:07.172 --> 01:53:08.957
MATT: That's magnificent. Thank you so much.

01:53:08.957 --> 01:53:14.791
TALIESIN: This will be for my favorite cocktail,
the pint of whiskey. Someone asked us what

01:53:14.791 --> 01:53:19.601
cocktail should I drink while watching Critical
Role and I sent them the recipe for pint of whiskey.

01:53:19.601 --> 01:53:21.348
MATT: We now lead to the bigger boxes.

01:53:21.348 --> 01:53:23.641
MARISHA: Do they just get a pint?

01:53:23.641 --> 01:53:26.435
TALIESIN: You take a pint glass, you fill it with
whiskey, and then you tell anyone who tells you

01:53:26.435 --> 01:53:30.990
that's not a cocktail to shut the fuck up. It's
the recipe for pint of whiskey.

01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:35.708
MATT: (Russian accent) All right Taliesin, deliver
the big box.

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:36.715
TALIESIN: (Russian accent) The big box.

01:53:36.715 --> 01:53:37.946
MATT: (Russian accent) Bring it to this place.

01:53:37.946 --> 01:53:39.082
TALIESIN: (Russian accent) The big box.

01:53:41.952 --> 01:53:43.875
BRIAN: We're not sure yet about PAX East.

01:53:43.875 --> 01:53:51.999
TALIESIN: We are not sure about-- we just got our
first series of "What cons do you want to do this

01:53:52.369 --> 01:53:56.217
"year?" letters and we're all staring at them like
deer in the headlights.

01:53:56.217 --> 01:54:01.341
MATT: We've got a lot of work at home to do and
we're trying to decide what we can go to and not

01:54:01.341 --> 01:54:02.097
go insane.

01:54:02.097 --> 01:54:05.218
TALIESIN: Yeah, without losing our minds and
letting everything suffer, letting our health suffer.

01:54:05.218 --> 01:54:08.467
MARISHA: That's the problem, we all work at least
two or three full-time jobs.

01:54:08.467 --> 01:54:10.750
TALIESIN: (high stressed-out voice) At this point? Yeah.

01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:18.445
BRIAN: We'll definitely let you guys know as soon
as we figure out any cons or Critical Role Lives

01:54:18.684 --> 01:54:22.928
or appearances for this year. We'll let you guys
know right away. We're still trying to figure it

01:54:22.928 --> 01:54:23.593
out, guys.

01:54:23.593 --> 01:54:30.640
MATT: This is from Emily Duette, I think it says.
Emily Duette.

01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:31.440
BRIAN: Emily, do it!

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.595
MARISHA: Do it, do it!

01:54:34.595 --> 01:54:36.267
MATT: Oh, we all got specific boxes!

01:54:36.267 --> 01:54:37.525
MARISHA: Oh, boxes!

01:54:37.525 --> 01:54:39.932
BRIAN: You're welcome, ComedianNaroo.

01:54:39.932 --> 01:54:41.930
TALIESIN: I think mine's the one with the S on
it.

01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:46.625
MATT: I think it's probably Scanlan's. I think
yours is the one with the actual De Rolo crest on it.

01:54:46.625 --> 01:54:48.839
TALIESIN: I don't think that's right. That's
probably not mine.

01:54:48.839 --> 01:55:01.648
MATT: What is in there? Oh, we got this for a lot
of people. Oh, these are awesome! Oh, what?

01:55:01.648 --> 01:55:12.341
MARISHA: Oh, that's awesome! She made this
necklace that--

01:55:12.341 --> 01:55:18.979
TALIESIN: What is up with everyone's handwriting
being so nice? I feel like such a slacker. This is

01:55:18.979 --> 01:55:22.785
some intense hand-- I can't even get over the
handwriting, I'm sorry. I'm having a moment with this.

01:55:22.785 --> 01:55:24.174
MATT: No, handwriting is amazing.

01:55:24.174 --> 01:55:25.163
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

01:55:25.163 --> 01:55:26.507
MATT: Emily, your handwriting looks like Elvish.

01:55:26.507 --> 01:55:27.391
TALIESIN: It looks like a font!

01:55:27.391 --> 01:55:28.970
MATT: It looks like straight-up Tolkien.

01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:30.342
MARISHA: Yeah, it really does.

01:55:30.342 --> 01:55:33.173
MATT: Like Quenya. It's awesome.

01:55:33.173 --> 01:55:40.492
MARISHA: She made this necklace inspired by "Make
Them Gold" from my playlist.

01:55:40.492 --> 01:55:41.314
MATT: Oh, no way. That's awesome!

01:55:41.314 --> 01:55:43.190
MARISHA: Yeah! That is so rad.

01:55:43.190 --> 01:55:47.410
MATT: This inner-workings journal, by the way,
this leather binding on this is <i>awesome</i>. This is

01:55:47.410 --> 01:55:48.939
fantastic, thank you so much.

01:55:48.939 --> 01:55:54.503
MARISHA: This is so pretty! Aw, thank you.

01:55:54.503 --> 01:55:59.565
BRIAN: So much love. I love you guys. You guys are
so nice.

01:55:59.565 --> 01:56:08.184
TALIESIN: Aw, now that's classy. Yes, I know what
to do with this.

01:56:08.184 --> 01:56:10.661
BRIAN: "I know what to do with this, yes."

01:56:10.661 --> 01:56:12.694
TALIESIN: It is a monogrammed handkerchief.

01:56:12.694 --> 01:56:13.706
BRIAN: It's monogrammed?

01:56:13.706 --> 01:56:17.656
TALIESIN: It's got a little stitched de Rolo
skull.

01:56:17.656 --> 01:56:22.041
BRIAN: Oh! That's dope.

01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:28.664
MATT: (chuckling) Thank you, Emily, and I'm
excited to be in Final Fantasy.

01:56:28.664 --> 01:56:30.002
BRIAN: What the heck? It's frozen.

01:56:30.002 --> 01:56:35.649
MATT: Her box is Cor Leonis-themed from Final
Fantasy XV, which makes me happy. Thank you so

01:56:35.649 --> 01:56:36.584
much, Emily.

01:56:36.584 --> 01:56:38.691
BRIAN: Thank you, Emily.

01:56:38.691 --> 01:56:40.566
TALIESIN: This is such a pretty box.

01:56:40.566 --> 01:56:42.681
MARISHA: Thank you for your letter, Emily.

01:56:42.681 --> 01:56:44.373
MATT: Better get this to the rest of the cast.

01:56:44.373 --> 01:56:46.675
MARISHA: This box is so pretty.

01:56:46.675 --> 01:56:47.872
TALIESIN: Be right back.

01:56:47.872 --> 01:56:51.207
MATT: Taliesin, don't leave us.

01:56:51.207 --> 01:56:52.235
TALIESIN: I'm leaving you!

01:56:52.235 --> 01:56:58.655
MATT: (Sean Connery voice) Don't leave us, Taliesin!
We require your presence.

01:56:58.655 --> 01:57:03.122
I'm sorry, Taliesin has left us. There's no hope. No.

01:57:03.122 --> 01:57:06.286
TALIESIN: Yes! All right, I'm going to take that
box away.

01:57:06.286 --> 01:57:07.784
MATT: Stop it with the dice ball!

01:57:07.784 --> 01:57:11.817
TALIESIN: I'm going to take that box away. That
box is going to go away over here.

01:57:11.817 --> 01:57:13.191
MATT: We've gotten a little loopy at this point, I
apologize.

01:57:13.191 --> 01:57:15.098
BRIAN: Yeah, we're all white girl wasted.

01:57:15.098 --> 01:57:16.280
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.991
MATT: We will be now that we have the proper shot
glasses.

01:57:21.397 --> 01:57:25.443
TALIESIN: We know what happened in Vegas. You got
drunk. Everybody knows.

01:57:25.443 --> 01:57:33.493
MATT: You got drunk and danced with your friends.
You basic. Basic as <i>fuck</i>.-- It's one of the

01:57:33.493 --> 01:57:35.377
best, and the follow up--

01:57:35.377 --> 01:57:36.476
TALIESIN: Made you grow up.

01:57:36.476 --> 01:57:39.693
MATT: The best things they've done outside of that
ruins everything.

01:57:39.693 --> 01:57:42.865
TALIESIN: This is from Chris--

01:57:42.865 --> 01:57:47.214
BRIAN: I can't get the camera to turn back around
towards you guys. Hold on a second.

01:57:47.214 --> 01:57:48.717
TALIESIN: What was that, dude?

01:57:48.717 --> 01:57:50.551
BRIAN: I'm trying, but it's-- I got it.

01:57:50.551 --> 01:57:52.449
TALIESIN: Okay everyone, yeah, we all know--

01:57:52.449 --> 01:57:54.673
BRIAN: Oh, damn it. Hold on, wait.

01:57:54.673 --> 01:57:57.810
MATT: Do you need help with this?

01:57:57.810 --> 01:58:02.609
BRIAN: It's lagging because it's--

01:58:02.609 --> 01:58:04.070
MATT: Cancel that, Brian.

01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.823
BRIAN: Good lord.

01:58:04.823 --> 01:58:06.845
MATT: Brian? Yeah, ready?

01:58:06.845 --> 01:58:08.597
BRIAN: Okay.

01:58:08.597 --> 01:58:10.464
MATT: There you go, Brian.

01:58:10.464 --> 01:58:11.312
BRIAN: Wow.

01:58:11.312 --> 01:58:12.151
MARISHA: Did you get it?

01:58:12.151 --> 01:58:15.566
BRIAN: I don't know technology very well, you
guys.

01:58:15.566 --> 01:58:16.328
TALIESIN: All right.

01:58:16.328 --> 01:58:21.362
MATT: Trying to clear off the packing peanuts.

01:58:21.362 --> 01:58:22.693
TALIESIN: There's a couple more over there.

01:58:22.693 --> 01:58:24.915
MARISHA: It's like an archaeologist's dig.

01:58:24.915 --> 01:58:27.418
MATT: So guys.

01:58:27.418 --> 01:58:33.656
TALIESIN: There's the thing that happened.

01:58:33.656 --> 01:58:39.781
MATT: There's a fantastic group of very talented
artist Critters who have been slowly categorizing

01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:46.809
the death of each member of the Chroma Conclave
with a bust. This is their recent gift.

01:58:46.809 --> 01:58:49.996
TALIESIN: We want to unwrap and not pull up.

01:58:49.996 --> 01:58:52.378
BRIAN: I'll have them find the mug in just a sec,
PinkyPal.

01:58:52.378 --> 01:58:53.351
TALIESIN: Hmm?

01:58:53.351 --> 01:58:54.894
BRIAN: I'm talking to PinkyPal!

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:57.827
TALIESIN: Well, fine. I don't really want to talk
to you anyway.

01:58:57.827 --> 01:58:59.043
MARISHA: Talking to your make-believe friends?

01:58:59.043 --> 01:58:59.622
BRIAN: Yeah.

01:58:59.622 --> 01:59:01.193
TALIESIN: Your make-believe Internet friends?

01:59:01.193 --> 01:59:02.411
BRIAN: All my make-believe friends.

01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:05.109
MATT: Getting close, you guys.

01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:12.267
TALIESIN: That would be a good burn. You're so
awful that imaginary people on the internet make

01:59:12.267 --> 01:59:13.089
fun of you.

01:59:13.089 --> 01:59:15.161
BRIAN: Is this what I think it is?

01:59:15.161 --> 01:59:16.190
TALIESIN and MATT: Yeah!

01:59:16.190 --> 01:59:20.538
TALIESIN: This is going to happen. Oh wait, do you
see what's in its mouth?

01:59:20.538 --> 01:59:21.605
BRIAN: Oh my god.

01:59:21.605 --> 01:59:24.373
TALIESIN: Do you see what's in its mouth? That's
not a packing peanut.

01:59:24.373 --> 01:59:28.728
MATT: No, this is for the LEDs that are inside
Thordak.

01:59:28.728 --> 01:59:30.714
BRIAN: Get the fuck out of here.

01:59:30.714 --> 01:59:37.190
TALIESIN: Wow! Wait, let's try it. Here we go.

01:59:37.190 --> 01:59:43.954
MARISHA: Holy shit. Wow. This might be the best--

01:59:43.954 --> 01:59:46.761
TALIESIN: What kind of batteries? Is there a
thing, maybe?

01:59:46.761 --> 01:59:49.013
MATT: There are six batteries. You can change
batteries in the back.

01:59:49.013 --> 01:59:52.745
TALIESIN: It might need to be flipped. Does the
thing need to be pulled or anything?

01:59:52.745 --> 01:59:57.197
MARISHA: What are we going to do with these
things? You want to put them on the Talks

01:59:57.197 --> 02:00:02.019
Machina-- oh, but-- I don't know, the new staff,
maybe?

02:00:02.019 --> 02:00:05.689
BRIAN: Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:12.410
TALIESIN: Yeah, it should be-- we'll figure out
how to light it up, but boy, does it light up.

02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:15.700
MATT: Oh, look at the gem there exposed too!

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:17.519
BRIAN: Everyone says put them in the set.

02:00:17.519 --> 02:00:20.059
MATT: Look at that shit.

02:00:20.059 --> 02:00:23.749
MARISHA: Look at the gems, the crystals coming out
of his horns.

02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:25.702
MATT: That's so fricking cool, you guys!

02:00:25.702 --> 02:00:27.636
MARISHA: Wow, that's stupid.

02:00:27.636 --> 02:00:30.794
MATT: Consistently outdoing yourself with each
gift.

02:00:30.794 --> 02:00:32.731
TALIESIN: We are going to need to get some
batteries going on over here.

02:00:32.731 --> 02:00:34.333
MARISHA: What kind of batteries?

02:00:34.333 --> 02:00:35.428
MATT and TALIESIN: Double A.

02:00:35.428 --> 02:00:37.170
BRIAN: I can't believe the detail on this thing.

02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:41.015
MATT: They do incredible work. Holy shit.

02:00:41.015 --> 02:00:43.679
BRIAN: That's my finger.

02:00:43.679 --> 02:00:44.505
MATT: Holy shit!

02:00:44.505 --> 02:00:47.431
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to need to get some
batteries in this motherfucker. They might be in

02:00:47.431 --> 02:00:49.314
backwards, sometimes people flip the battery.

02:00:49.314 --> 02:00:53.218
MATT: That's true. I'm going to hold it by the
throat.

02:00:53.218 --> 02:00:54.018
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I know.

02:00:54.018 --> 02:00:55.154
MATT: Jesus Christ!

02:00:55.154 --> 02:00:56.436
BRIAN: How many is that now?

02:00:56.436 --> 02:00:59.177
MATT: That's four. They only have one member of
the Conclave left.

02:00:59.177 --> 02:01:04.281
MARISHA: Yeah. Where are the other ones? Oh, we
put them in your office, that's right.

02:01:04.281 --> 02:01:04.818
MATT: Yeah.

02:01:04.818 --> 02:01:10.412
MARISHA: What happens if we don't kill Raishan?

02:01:10.412 --> 02:01:17.242
BRIAN: Switch under the plaque on the base? Is
there a switch under the plaque on the base of it?

02:01:17.242 --> 02:01:18.786
That's what they were saying on the Internet.

02:01:18.786 --> 02:01:19.606
MATT: Oh, maybe.

02:01:19.606 --> 02:01:24.020
BRIAN: I'm filming nothing, sorry. What's the
longest Matt's hair's ever been?

02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:30.437
MATT: Oh man, in high school, it was down to
almost my waist in the back.

02:01:30.437 --> 02:01:33.571
BRIAN: Almost to your waist in the back?

02:01:33.571 --> 02:01:37.034
MATT: Yeah, it was about-- there's the letter I
was looking for. Oh, and new batteries.

02:01:37.034 --> 02:01:37.868
BRIAN: Oh, batteries.

02:01:37.868 --> 02:01:38.618
TALIESIN: Oh, well there we go.

02:01:38.618 --> 02:01:42.220
BRIAN: They said a switch under the-- I don't know
if it's someone who knows or not or if they're

02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:43.293
just guessing to try and help us out.

02:01:43.293 --> 02:01:45.292
TALIESIN: They're just guessing, there's not a
switch under the back.

02:01:45.292 --> 02:01:49.115
BRIAN: Saturnus, just tweet me @brianwfoster.

02:01:49.115 --> 02:01:51.342
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think we just change out the
battery. We'll see if that does it.

02:01:51.342 --> 02:01:55.926
MATT: Yeah, my hair was about that long in high
school.

02:01:55.926 --> 02:02:00.918
BRIAN: Wow. And then, Taliesin, some people are
asking the length of your hair right now because

02:02:00.918 --> 02:02:02.154
it's hard to tell with the sexy cut.

02:02:02.154 --> 02:02:08.676
TALIESIN: Oh, well, here, I'll pull my lovely hat
off. And it kind of fades in the back, so it's

02:02:08.676 --> 02:02:10.157
longer on the front then it is in the back.

02:02:10.157 --> 02:02:12.232
BRIAN: Mine does the same thing, except it's not
as beautiful.

02:02:12.232 --> 02:02:13.679
TALIESIN: We could beaut you up.

02:02:13.679 --> 02:02:15.673
BRIAN: We could do me up.

02:02:15.673 --> 02:02:18.851
TALIESIN: We could see with a blacklight, we could
give you blacklight tips when you go out.

02:02:18.851 --> 02:02:19.682
BRIAN: Hell yeah.

02:02:19.682 --> 02:02:21.693
TALIESIN: You'll look like there was a crime
scene.

02:02:21.693 --> 02:02:24.128
BRIAN: Yeah, that's-- yeah, something.

02:02:24.128 --> 02:02:31.916
MARISHA: Let's put on more music. Man, this looks
like a Critmas hurricane went off in my front

02:02:31.916 --> 02:02:32.766
living room.

02:02:32.766 --> 02:02:36.801
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we're not done, there's still
more, I think. No.

02:02:36.801 --> 02:02:39.758
MATT: Yeah, there's a little bit more. There's
three more boxes to do.

02:02:39.758 --> 02:02:44.553
TALIESIN: Okay. Woo! Thank you guys for sticking
around for a long--

02:02:44.553 --> 02:02:46.377
BRIAN: This is crazy amount of stuff!

02:02:46.377 --> 02:02:48.160
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.976
MATT: When you have a community as amazing as
this--

02:02:50.976 --> 02:02:52.201
BRIAN: What's this doing over there?

02:02:52.201 --> 02:02:52.964
TALIESIN: What's what?

02:02:52.964 --> 02:02:55.239
BRIAN: What's this map doing over here?

02:02:55.239 --> 02:02:58.910
TALIESIN: Oh, that's remnants of bad decisions.

02:02:58.910 --> 02:03:04.390
MATT: That is half of the Thordak battle map. For
those who don't know how I do these usually, these

02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:09.795
are big baking tins that I sprayed with Plasti
Dip, so they have a sticky, or at least, resistant

02:03:09.795 --> 02:03:15.535
surface. That way, I can build the map at home and
then take it in pieces to the set and in the back of

02:03:15.535 --> 02:03:16.825
my car.

02:03:16.825 --> 02:03:17.884
BRIAN: That's what these are?

02:03:17.884 --> 02:03:20.240
MATT: Yeah. These are actual two halves of the
same set and I put them side-by-side.

02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:20.667
BRIAN: Wow.

02:03:20.667 --> 02:03:24.901
MATT: And I have a bridge piece between the two of
them. That way I can build them at home and

02:03:25.239 --> 02:03:27.298
transport them to the studio than having to build
them on the actual set.

02:03:27.298 --> 02:03:29.970
MARISHA: You've got to transport them like it's a
wedding cake.

02:03:29.970 --> 02:03:32.180
BRIAN: This is Defcon Zero DMing right now.

02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:35.843
MARISHA: Oh, fuck yeah! Give it.

02:03:35.843 --> 02:03:43.213
BRIAN: Oh my god. That is so crazy.

02:03:43.213 --> 02:03:44.369
MARISHA: Are you going through the settings?

02:03:44.369 --> 02:03:45.291
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:03:45.291 --> 02:03:49.271
MARISHA: There we go.

02:03:49.271 --> 02:03:51.206
MATT: Look at the patterns.

02:03:51.206 --> 02:03:53.530
MARISHA: Uh, that's sick.

02:03:53.530 --> 02:03:58.160
BRIAN: Hang it on the door and when someone rings
the doorbell, make the light turn on and just

02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.510
scare the shit out of them.

02:03:59.510 --> 02:04:02.087
MATT: That would be magnificent. Shit, guys.

02:04:02.087 --> 02:04:04.386
MARISHA: That's banging.

02:04:04.386 --> 02:04:06.101
BRIAN: Someone said, "Oh my god, it's
terrifying."

02:04:06.101 --> 02:04:07.205
MARISHA: Yeah, it kind of is.

02:04:07.205 --> 02:04:08.429
BRIAN: That's insane.

02:04:08.429 --> 02:04:09.409
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

02:04:09.409 --> 02:04:11.133
MATT: Can I see the remote?

02:04:11.133 --> 02:04:14.605
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's the remote to you. Well,
that's a thing that happened.

02:04:14.605 --> 02:04:19.904
MATT: That's a thing that exists. All right, we
got three more, one of which is a package that

02:04:19.904 --> 02:04:23.059
also got lost at the studio. Let's do that.

02:04:23.059 --> 02:04:24.410
TALIESIN: That one's already opened.

02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:28.854
BRIAN: Ryan Green lost this package, guys, but we
were able to find it using help from other friends

02:04:28.854 --> 02:04:30.231
that are more responsible.

02:04:30.231 --> 02:04:32.659
TALIESIN: As in, all of our friends.

02:04:32.659 --> 02:04:40.436
BRIAN: As in, literally our worst friends are more
responsible. I hope he's still on here.

02:04:40.436 --> 02:04:49.227
MARISHA: Oh yeah! What is it? Oh shit! Oh my god!

02:04:49.227 --> 02:04:50.325
MATT: And Vex.

02:04:50.325 --> 02:04:52.883
MARISHA: You guys.

02:04:52.883 --> 02:04:56.821
BRIAN: (singing) I've got a golden ticket!

02:04:56.821 --> 02:04:57.987
MARISHA: Oh my god!

02:04:57.987 --> 02:05:00.191
TALIESIN: That is a really big wallet for Matt.

02:05:00.191 --> 02:05:09.199
MARISHA: It's Kit and Wendy-- it's a few different
people's arts. It's leather that they've etched.

02:05:09.199 --> 02:05:16.750
BRIAN: Oh my gosh! What? (gasps)

02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:24.507
MARISHA: Right? This is from our Winter's Crest
festival comic that Taliesin and I wrote when we

02:05:24.507 --> 02:05:27.808
did our little comic. Look at that.

02:05:27.808 --> 02:05:28.542
BRIAN: Holy cow.

02:05:28.542 --> 02:05:31.890
MATT: I don't quite know what this is yet--

02:05:31.890 --> 02:05:33.448
TALIESIN: I have a funny feeling.

02:05:33.448 --> 02:05:38.532
BRIAN: Oh my gosh, that's wood!

02:05:38.532 --> 02:05:40.560
TALIESIN: That's fucking gorgeous.

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:45.271
MATT: That's amazing, holy shit!

02:05:45.271 --> 02:05:48.024
BRIAN: That is dope!

02:05:48.476 --> 02:05:55.887
MARISHA: Wow. That's even more-- and it was the
art contest winner, that's even more amazing. We

02:05:55.887 --> 02:05:58.031
might have to do some set redecorating.

02:05:58.031 --> 02:05:59.614
BRIAN: Heck yes we do.

02:05:59.614 --> 02:06:01.264
MATT: Is that from-- is it Robbie?

02:06:01.264 --> 02:06:06.085
MARISHA: I forgot, he sent wallets for the guys.

02:06:06.085 --> 02:06:07.127
MATT: RecklessRobbie.

02:06:07.127 --> 02:06:10.792
TALIESIN: From Colorado Springs, I love Colorado
Springs!

02:06:10.792 --> 02:06:18.836
MARISHA: RecklessRobbie. Wow.

02:06:18.836 --> 02:06:23.729
MARISHA: "You better hope by the you read this
that the Chroma Conclave has finally met a fitting

02:06:23.729 --> 02:06:31.125
"end and your band of adventurers is on to fighting
the next evil that has reared its head." Almost.

02:06:31.125 --> 02:06:33.951
MATT: Maybe. Pending.

02:06:33.951 --> 02:06:35.499
TALIESIN: Could be.

02:06:35.989 --> 02:06:37.311
MARISHA: We got really close.

02:06:37.311 --> 02:06:41.462
MATT: "I go by RecklessRobbie on most things
Internet and ArtThroughFlame on Etsy. Travis

02:06:41.462 --> 02:06:43.957
"seemed to enjoy the last one of these I made."
This is the guy that made the last one with him

02:06:43.957 --> 02:06:48.642
screaming, "Vax!" "So I figured I'd make another
one that's continuing. Thank you for this

02:06:48.642 --> 02:06:51.400
"amazing-ness that is Critical Role. I didn't make
one for any particular member of the group, so if

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:54.623
"there isn't a spot for it in the studio, then the
cast will simply have to fight over it." Oh no,

02:06:54.623 --> 02:06:56.566
we'll find a place for it.

02:06:56.566 --> 02:06:57.823
TALIESIN: That will hit Talks.

02:06:57.823 --> 02:06:59.072
MATT: That is so cool.

02:06:59.072 --> 02:07:01.139
TALIESIN: This is why I love the Talks set,
because we can--

02:07:01.139 --> 02:07:04.854
MATT: "Quite literally, if you have another battle
royale in the horizon, have the winner choose who

02:07:04.854 --> 02:07:06.068
"gets it." I do kind of like that.

02:07:06.068 --> 02:07:07.942
BRIAN: That's a good idea.

02:07:07.942 --> 02:07:10.797
MATT: We'll see if there's a place on the set and
if not, we'll do just that.

02:07:10.797 --> 02:07:13.778
MARISHA: I think we're going to be getting an
upgrade soon.

02:07:13.778 --> 02:07:15.241
TALIESIN: Yeah, the set will be upgraded
hopefully.

02:07:15.241 --> 02:07:24.131
BRIAN: Matt, before I forget, the person who sent
the mugs over said to find the big ones, so to

02:07:24.131 --> 02:07:30.506
find yours because it's different. It's special,
it's different. Don't let me forget that.

02:07:30.506 --> 02:07:31.849
MARISHA: It's like a shield.

02:07:31.849 --> 02:07:33.153
TALIESIN: You got it, or should I get it?

02:07:33.153 --> 02:07:34.836
MATT: Yeah, it is straight-up a shield!

02:07:34.836 --> 02:07:41.016
BRIAN: Oh god. Everything's fine. It is a shield,
Thorin Oakenshield.

02:07:41.016 --> 02:07:44.940
MARISHA: (shouting) This is Vox Machina!

02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:56.115
TALIESIN: That's such an Adventure Show flashback.
I don't know if that made me happy or sad. Matt,

02:07:56.115 --> 02:07:58.039
Marisha, and I used to do improv together.

02:07:58.039 --> 02:07:58.742
MARISHA: That's true.

02:07:58.742 --> 02:08:04.955
MATT: I wasn't sure if I was going to get a box.
That's awesome, it says, "Vox Machina," it has the

02:08:04.955 --> 02:08:09.983
symbol on the other side. It says, "Dungeon Master
of a thousand voices," and it has a skull and crossbones.

02:08:09.983 --> 02:08:13.385
MARISHA: Motherfuck, that's awesome.

02:08:13.385 --> 02:08:14.972
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

02:08:14.972 --> 02:08:15.564
MARISHA: Wow.

02:08:15.564 --> 02:08:18.482
MATT: Man! This is going to come out so it can
stay in the kitchen.

02:08:18.482 --> 02:08:19.986
MARISHA: All right, so--

02:08:19.986 --> 02:08:27.100
TALIESIN: Two more to go. This insane-- saving
that for last? Okay.

02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:31.818
MATT: Wait, you know what, let's do that one now.
To preface this--

02:08:31.818 --> 02:08:33.549
TALIESIN: Is this the one that got left forever?

02:08:33.549 --> 02:08:36.636
MATT: No, this is the one that was at the post
box.

02:08:36.636 --> 02:08:38.724
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no one had a car big enough to
pick up.

02:08:38.724 --> 02:08:41.227
MATT: Yeah, and we had to particularly get it in
our vehicle.

02:08:41.227 --> 02:08:42.489
BRIAN: Oh my gosh.

02:08:42.489 --> 02:08:45.588
MATT: It is labeled with many "Fragile" stickers.

02:08:45.588 --> 02:08:48.175
TALIESIN: We'll see if that actually--

02:08:48.175 --> 02:08:54.100
MATT: As soon as you picked it up today, it was
like-- (parts moving)-- it has many small pieces

02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:57.382
moving inside, so there's a little part of me
that's feeling really anxious about this.

02:08:57.382 --> 02:08:58.409
BRIAN: Hopefully we're good.

02:08:58.409 --> 02:08:59.159
MATT: Hopefully we're good.

02:08:59.159 --> 02:09:00.568
MARISHA: Maybe it's--

02:09:00.568 --> 02:09:03.941
MATT: Whatever it is, I'll fix it if it's not
there, but hold that for a second.

02:09:03.941 --> 02:09:04.466
TALIESIN: I got it.

02:09:04.466 --> 02:09:10.770
MATT: I literally went to pick up today and I was
like, "Oh no, please no."

02:09:10.770 --> 02:09:18.207
BRIAN: I hope it's a painting of Sam laying down
in the naked Burt Reynolds pose.

02:09:18.207 --> 02:09:21.135
MARISHA: That would be amazing.

02:09:21.135 --> 02:09:26.320
BRIAN: Marisha Oakenshield, they say.

02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:35.860
TALIESIN: I think it may be fine, it may have just
been glass.

02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:41.756
BRIAN: Matt's mug comes with the players' tears.

02:09:41.756 --> 02:09:51.509
MATT: I get the sense based on the audio that
perhaps FedEx did not treat the box as kindly as you

02:09:52.065 --> 02:09:53.371
would have hoped.

02:09:53.371 --> 02:09:55.174
MARISHA: Wow, that's really big.

02:09:55.174 --> 02:09:56.951
MATT: It's huge.

02:09:56.951 --> 02:10:05.385
TALIESIN: I would say be careful because there's
probably going to be a bag of glass. I get that feeling.

02:10:06.163 --> 02:10:08.806
MATT: There's a letter in here that says--

02:10:08.806 --> 02:10:12.601
TALIESIN: That might be the thing. It might have
just been a big sound bag going crinkle crinkle.

02:10:12.601 --> 02:10:16.584
MATT: "To Matt and Marisha."

02:10:16.584 --> 02:10:17.257
BRIAN: Oh!

02:10:17.257 --> 02:10:20.178
MARISHA: This is to us? Oh. Jesus.

02:10:20.178 --> 02:10:22.666
TALIESIN: It's a painting of a horse head because
they figured you didn't have room.

02:10:22.666 --> 02:10:28.723
MATT: "Hey Sun Tree, hey Kiki. Dear Matt and
Marisha, I'd like to donate a framed poster of Vox

02:10:28.723 --> 02:10:33.560
"Machina to you. I ordered it and it was a bit
damaged on the edges, so Geek and Sundry sent me a

02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:39.388
"replacement. I had them both framed, hung one on
my wall and decided to send the other back to you

02:10:39.388 --> 02:10:44.911
"and perhaps auction it for charity, whatever you
like. Especially yours, Jason Morrison. Is it

02:10:44.911 --> 02:10:46.914
"Thursday yet? @JasonofArabia."

02:10:46.914 --> 02:10:48.243
MARISHA: Oh, Jason!

02:10:48.243 --> 02:10:50.935
BRIAN: Thank you Jason. JasonofArabia.

02:10:50.935 --> 02:10:57.660
TALIESIN: All right, let's-- we can definitely
leave this.

02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:58.643
MATT: Yeah, we can leave it out.

02:10:58.643 --> 02:10:59.771
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll keep cutting.

02:10:59.771 --> 02:11:01.011
MATT: It's thick plastic.

02:11:01.011 --> 02:11:05.594
MARISHA: Whoa. That scared the <i>shit</i> out of me.

02:11:11.844 --> 02:11:13.379
BRIAN: TukRoll in the house.

02:11:13.379 --> 02:11:25.492
TALIESIN: I should probably get out of the way
here. There are layers.

02:11:26.050 --> 02:11:27.323
MARISHA: There're several layers.

02:11:27.323 --> 02:11:39.892
TALIESIN: (surprised laughter) Oh yeah. The glass
did not do well.

02:11:39.892 --> 02:11:42.538
MATT: But that's okay.

02:11:42.538 --> 02:11:48.861
ALL: The poster survived!

02:11:48.861 --> 02:11:52.702
MATT: I feel like we shouldn't open it entirely,
because the more we don't open, the higher the

02:11:52.702 --> 02:11:54.421
chance we can-- we will get this reframed.

02:11:54.421 --> 02:11:57.458
TALIESIN: We're going to have to very gently get
this out of here.

02:11:57.458 --> 02:12:04.487
MARISHA: This is amazing. Aw, thank you! Thanks
for sending it for our wedding, especially since

02:12:04.487 --> 02:12:09.531
we didn't get one of those. We didn't get one. So
that's awesome.

02:12:09.531 --> 02:12:13.065
MATT: We didn't get one-- the framed one.

02:12:13.065 --> 02:12:14.711
BRIAN: What's the poster of?

02:12:14.711 --> 02:12:16.317
MATT: It's our actual poster.

02:12:16.317 --> 02:12:17.689
BRIAN: Oh, it's the big one?

02:12:17.689 --> 02:12:19.838
MARISHA: The big Joe Mad one.

02:12:19.838 --> 02:12:22.583
TALIESIN: The signed edition, we didn't think
through enough to get one for ourselves.

02:12:22.583 --> 02:12:28.674
MATT: I actually want to make a really good
charity gift or something.

02:12:28.674 --> 02:12:31.202
MARISHA: That might also be a great Talks
Machina-- or, yeah.

02:12:31.202 --> 02:12:33.330
MATT: Yeah, we'll get that fixed.

02:12:33.330 --> 02:12:35.894
BRIAN: Obviously, Glenn works for FedEx.

02:12:35.894 --> 02:12:40.445
MARISHA: Oh, god damn it, Glenn. Fucking Glenn.

02:12:40.445 --> 02:12:44.544
MATT: I wouldn't trust Glenn with anything, fuck
that guy.

02:12:44.544 --> 02:12:46.258
BRIAN: FedEx rolled a natural one.

02:12:46.258 --> 02:12:50.482
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's-- there's a couple of
little ones left in there, I think, but they're

02:12:50.482 --> 02:12:54.065
mostly letters, and we tend not to do-- although
there's anything that's package-sized.

02:12:54.065 --> 02:12:57.039
MARISHA: A few letters. We got letters from--

02:12:57.039 --> 02:13:00.823
MATT: Say who they're from so that we don't have
to take too much longer.

02:13:00.823 --> 02:13:08.995
MARISHA: From John Cox, Seth Taylor, Lee Teetsle.
I heard that.

02:13:08.995 --> 02:13:12.495
BRIAN: I love names, you know me.

02:13:12.495 --> 02:13:18.727
MARISHA: Gil M. Saint-Germain, Jenny Huntofts.

02:13:18.727 --> 02:13:20.598
MATT: Jay Carter, III.

02:13:20.598 --> 02:13:21.940
TALIESIN: Mooglefish.

02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:28.737
MARISHA and MATT: Francesco Spezzari.

02:13:28.737 --> 02:13:30.999
MATT: And Amanda Hokio.

02:13:30.999 --> 02:13:37.526
MARISHA: From Erlanger, Kentucky.

02:13:37.526 --> 02:13:38.198
MATT: Yeah!

02:13:38.198 --> 02:13:39.314
MARISHA: My neck of the woods.

02:13:39.314 --> 02:13:41.435
BRIAN and MARISHA: Kentucky!

02:13:41.435 --> 02:13:50.658
MARISHA: We got letters from you so you know we
will look at those. We also-- what is this?

02:13:50.658 --> 02:13:53.746
Time-sensitive, please get to Matt Mercer as soon
as possible.

02:13:53.746 --> 02:13:54.756
MATT: That's going to be useful.

02:13:54.756 --> 02:13:56.712
BRIAN: (singing) That's a subpoena.

02:13:56.712 --> 02:13:59.771
MATT: (chuckling) No. From Jamie Savage.

02:13:59.771 --> 02:14:05.247
TALIESIN: Oh no. I thought it was a baby bird
inside.

02:14:05.247 --> 02:14:09.594
BRIAN: "Lol, everytime Dagon chimes in my
cockatiel tries to carry a conversation."

02:14:09.594 --> 02:14:12.876
MARISHA: Aw, they're fwiends!

02:14:12.876 --> 02:14:17.191
MATT: This is actually the breakdown of "The Epic
Battles Made Easy" from the DMs Guild they

02:14:17.191 --> 02:14:18.327
printed out for me.

02:14:18.327 --> 02:14:22.404
MARISHA: Would any of it have been helpful?

02:14:22.404 --> 02:14:26.373
MATT: Well, it would've been helpful if you guys
hadn't bypassed the entirety of the actual war, so

02:14:26.373 --> 02:14:29.106
it never would've come up. So it's their fault.

02:14:29.106 --> 02:14:30.185
BRIAN: Yeah.

02:14:30.185 --> 02:14:35.529
TALIESIN: We kind of snuck under. We did the
old-school Hollywood, "They're killing them by the

02:14:35.529 --> 02:14:36.766
"thousands out there."

02:14:36.766 --> 02:14:46.218
MATT: But no, this is great. Which, by the way
guys, I've actually downloaded this already,

02:14:46.601 --> 02:14:52.221
Jamie, in preparation for these types of things.
Not with these specific creations, of course,

02:14:52.221 --> 02:14:56.404
here, but this is awesome. If you guys haven't
seen it on the DMs Guild, this is a really good

02:14:56.404 --> 02:15:01.982
way to help or break the large-scale
army-versus-army combat D&D without being a

02:15:01.982 --> 02:15:06.595
billion dice rolls and bog down the actual
narrative, so, thank you so much, it's awesome.

02:15:06.595 --> 02:15:10.827
MARISHA: All right, guys. I think that's it.
Right?

02:15:10.827 --> 02:15:12.098
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think--

02:15:12.098 --> 02:15:17.150
MARISHA: I need a break and some tea. Maybe a
glass of wine.

02:15:22.730 --> 02:15:24.439
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

02:15:24.439 --> 02:15:25.656
MARISHA: We did it!

02:15:25.656 --> 02:15:30.668
ALL: Yay!

02:15:31.159 --> 02:15:37.306
MATT: Thank you guys all so much for all of your
amazing generosity to the community, to us and our

02:15:37.306 --> 02:15:45.029
ridiculous D&D show. Please continue to support
all the amazing causes that you do, and we do, and

02:15:45.029 --> 02:15:45.638
each other.

02:15:45.638 --> 02:15:49.513
MARISHA: I know, and all the charity gifts are
always amazing. Thank you so much for all the

02:15:49.513 --> 02:15:54.912
congratulations and all the kind words and all
the--

02:15:54.912 --> 02:15:55.457
BRIAN: Damn it.

02:15:55.457 --> 02:15:56.177
TALIESIN: The sugar!

02:15:56.177 --> 02:16:04.434
MARISHA: The sugar. I really hope I kill Raishan
so I get to keep that little green dragon.

02:16:04.434 --> 02:16:05.092
BRIAN: We'll see.

02:16:05.092 --> 02:16:12.379
MATT: Guys, thank you so much. We love you, and
we'll see you soon. Is it Thursday yet?

02:16:12.379 --> 02:16:14.074
BRIAN: Love you guys. Bye!

02:16:14.074 --> 02:16:15.862
TALIESIN: Happy weekend!

02:16:15.862 --> 02:16:18.552
MARISHA: We'll see you on Tuesday for Talks
Machina.

02:16:18.552 --> 02:16:21.578
MATT: Brian, you going to do what I do? You're
doing what I'm doing.

02:16:21.578 --> 02:16:22.316
BRIAN: Hold on.

02:16:22.316 --> 02:16:27.962
MATT: Yeah, it's not so easy when it's your-- huh?
How do you turn this off, huh? How do you do this?

02:16:27.962 --> 02:16:28.992
BRIAN: Is it this?

02:16:28.992 --> 02:16:32.284
MATT: How do you do it? How do you do it, Brian?
How do you turn this off, huh?

02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:36.994
BRIAN: Is it-- it says "swipe down," but that's
your main thing.

02:16:36.994 --> 02:16:38.235
MATT: All right. So?

02:16:38.235 --> 02:16:40.463
MARISHA: Wow, every time. Every time.

02:16:40.463 --> 02:16:46.062
BRIAN: (laughing) This is so good! I think there's
too many people and it's freezing the Periscope.

02:16:46.062 --> 02:16:49.467
MATT: Maybe. Well, you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to go ahead and--

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:50.190
TALIESIN: It ain't going to work.

02:16:50.190 --> 02:16:52.320
MATT: Hard close. Bye, guys!

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:57.183
BRIAN: That was so funny. It wouldn't stop.
