NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.158
Hi, my name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a voice actor
and the Dungeon Master for Geek &amp; Sundry's

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:08.607
Critical Role, and welcome to this fun video
series about tips and tricks for game masters and

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:14.578
dungeon masters alike. Today, I'm doing an FAQ,
because I get a lot of questions often over and

00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:18.297
over again, and while I'd like to answer as often
as possible, it might be easier to put this up as

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:21.778
a video and answer some of them for the
foreseeable future.

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:24.948
[theme music]

00:00:24.948 --> 00:00:30.827
Number one, is your Critical Role story a
homebrew? Yes! I created it from the ground up,

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:35.637
for better for worse, and I'm still developing it
as we continue playing the game. I did borrow the

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:41.488
Dawn War pantheon for it as it was a memorable and
relatable pantheon, but there are some

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:46.888
carried-over gods from Pathfinder because it's
where we began the campaign in Pathfinder, then

00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:52.836
converted over to 5th Edition partway through.
It's all homebrew and if time allows me in the

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:57.474
future, maybe I'll put something out for you guys
if you want to play around in Exandria, so fingers crossed.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.572
Number two, I see you looking in your app a lot
for reference during the game. What app do you

00:01:00.572 --> 00:01:07.182
use? I use Fight Club 5 on iOS. It's a free
software. It requires a little bit of jiggering to

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:12.142
get it to work. You have to download some files
from certain websites and then upload it through

00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:15.812
Dropbox onto the actual app, so it's a little
involved with the get-go and you have to do some

00:01:15.812 --> 00:01:19.864
research on Google to find out how to actually do
it, but it's an extremely helpful resource for

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:23.533
quick reference to spells. You can bookmark
spells, creatures, abilities, see classes and

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:27.403
racial feats. It's great. So that's been very
helpful to me.

00:01:27.403 --> 00:01:33.633
How do you make your maps? I start with
one-inch-grid easel paper. You can get these giant

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:40.191
pads of one-inch-grid easel paper on amazon.com.
Those are great, because you can just go ahead and

00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:43.624
tear them off. They're semi-transparent, and then
I go ahead and get some Crayola markers and some

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:48.053
colored pencils and I build from there. I usually
sketch out on a small scale first just to get the

00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:52.482
feel for how the battlefield will look and flow,
and then I draw the larger version and fill it out

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:55.913
and use that for the actual game. But there's a
lot of great software online that you can create

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:59.862
maps with. You can do things like Photoshop,
Campaign Cartographer, and if you play online for

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:04.403
Roll20, there are a lot of great software in those
communities that you can ask about that that help

00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:07.923
you build your own maps to look really awesome and
professional too, so look into that.

00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:13.622
Where do you find, or how do you make your
playlists for your game? I make them on iTunes and

00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:18.393
I pull from many tracks. Mine currently are made
up from tracks from Platemail Games, which has a

00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:25.013
lot of cool atmospheric and thematic tracks for
locations and terrain. I use Midnight Syndicate,

00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:30.572
has a lot of great tracks. Incompetech from Kevin
MacLeod has a lot of great tracks, and all those

00:02:30.572 --> 00:02:34.943
are royalty-free, meaning these are kind of the
only ones we were able to use when we started the

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:38.495
stream. Since then, I've gotten permission to use
the soundtrack from the PC game Pillars of

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:43.743
Eternity. I've gotten permission to use the Elder
Scrolls series soundtrack from Bethesda and those

00:02:43.743 --> 00:02:46.798
have all been really cool. You guys won't have to
worry about that if you're doing home games. You

00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:50.750
can use <i>any</i> music you want. You don't have those
limitations. But I highly recommend any of those.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.290
You can pull soundtracks from Conan the Barbarian.
You can pull in Final Fantasy tracks if you want

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.309
to. Anything you want to, but what I do is I break
them down into playlists and each playlist is a

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:03.677
certain mood or location, so I have a playlist for
small battles, one for big battles, one for boss

00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:09.138
battles. I have a playlist for creepy. I have a
playlist for <i>really</i> creepy areas. I have a

00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:13.028
playlist for a mysterious scenario, I have
playlists when it's peaceful. I have playlists for

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:16.867
when you are in a town, playlists when you are in
a tavern. That way, it's just really easy for me

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:22.539
to just click any one of these playlists for a
specific moment. It takes a little bit of setup

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.259
and it's a lot of time put into it to make sure
you have that layout, but once you have it, as a

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:30.379
Dungeon Master or as a Game Master, it's really
easy to go ahead and switch pretty quickly based

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.857
on how the scenario's mood and dynamic has
changed.

00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:38.448
Can I use or incorporate your characters or parts
of your world in my campaign? Sure! Yes, please go

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:43.608
for it. I find it flattering. I think it's awesome
that you would want to have tie-ins or elements of

00:03:43.608 --> 00:03:49.247
your game crossed over to ours. Just be aware that
players' actions in our game can sometimes change

00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:54.498
the world, so if you want to be playing alongside
our campaign, there's always a chance that things

00:03:54.498 --> 00:03:59.078
can get weird down the road, so be prepared. If
you want to keep it consistent at least, make

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:04.279
things weird on your end as well. I don't know--
depends what the players do. But if time ever

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:10.308
allows, I would love to make a sourcebook, so
we'll see if that's ever a possibility if time

00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:15.798
lets me. How can I improve my skills as a GM or a
Dungeon Master? First and foremost-- it's not

00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:21.087
necessary but it's so helpful-- improv classes.
You don't have to want to be a performer or an

00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:24.748
actor to take improv. It's helpful in so many
facets of your life. Just the idea of quick

00:04:24.748 --> 00:04:30.760
thinking, of being able to "Yes, and" and work
with other people to make fast decisions and listen

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.180
very well and to be able to adjust on the fly.
It's helpful in everything from business to social

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.359
dynamics to so many things, but it tremendously
helps for dungeon-mastering or game-mastering your

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:49.781
role playing game. Also, you can look online for
great blogs from other Dungeon Masters. If you can

00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:56.452
find it, I'd recommend looking up Chris Perkins'
DM experience blog for episodes-- you can find

00:04:56.452 --> 00:05:01.151
them still, I think. There's some good stuff on
there. You can also look at a lot of the really

00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:05.613
great real-play shows that are online, like
Rock'n'Roleplay, and probably some Acquisitions

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:11.291
Inc. stuff that Chris Perkins himself did at PAX,
or you could watch Critical Role! But you can find

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:16.421
a lot of cool little tricks and interesting
techniques that different Dungeon Masters use to

00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.431
make their games immersive, and everyone's
different, everyone has their own method, everyone

00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:24.321
has their really cool thing they do. So watching them
all, you can pick and choose and build your own

00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:25.620
cool method.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.531
Final question for this FAQ: How does this random
rule or feature work in D&amp;D? Google. Google is

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:38.171
your friend. I know a lot of the rules in the
game, but there are also some that I'm even fuzzy

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:43.619
on. If you have any questions or any concerns or
anything you're not sure about in the game and how

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:49.220
the rules work, before you tweet it at me, look it
up. Put it into Google. You'll find a lot of great

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.122
people that have probably asked the same question
many times over and a lot of people that are

00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:58.141
probably much more alert in the rule system than I am
who have answered it. So go ahead and just give a

00:05:58.141 --> 00:06:02.661
search out there, find the communities that work
out there. Rpg.net is great about that and

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.971
Reddit's really great, and get those answers
there. And if you're still stumped, then go ahead

00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:11.721
and throw it at me. Otherwise, I end up not having
time to answer all those tweets and I feel bad.

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:13.452
So, go to Google. It'll help you out.

00:06:13.452 --> 00:06:17.001
That's all I've got for this FAQ. I might have
another one down the road in the future, depending

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:22.673
on how these questions continue and you guys have
really cool things you want to ask, so once again,

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:26.170
thank you for coming by. You can see more of these
videos on geekandsundry.com and I'll see you

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.562
around soon.
