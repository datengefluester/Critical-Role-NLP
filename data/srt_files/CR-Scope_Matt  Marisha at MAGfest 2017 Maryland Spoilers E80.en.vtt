NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.032
[dramatic music]

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:23.152
(applause)

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:24.750
MATT: We found the room.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.791
(cheering)

00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.033
MARISHA: Before that, we found the bar.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:34.213
(cheering)

00:00:34.213 --> 00:00:40.809
MARISHA: But it was like running the gauntlet,
man. Oh, man. I'm here.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.634
MATT: Like the original gauntlet, not like
Gauntlet gauntlet– The initial variation of

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:48.702
gauntlet. Yes, Marisha Ray needs tequila badly.

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:51.712
(laughter)

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:53.052
MARISHA: Liquid courage!

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.540
MATT: They say it works well. Well, hi,
everybody!

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.260
(cheering)

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.432
MATT: Apologies for the slight delay, but we are
now kicking underway to the 2017 MAGFest Critical

00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:05.241
Role panel!

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:11.452
(cheering)

00:01:11.452 --> 00:01:15.230
MATT: I guess we'll do some quick introductions. I
think some people here already know who we are, so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.823
we'll make them very quick. Hi. Who are you?

00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:20.491
MARISHA: Hi. I'm Marisha Ray.

00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:24.342
AUDIENCE: Hi, Marisha.

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:28.141
MATT: (cheering)

00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.792
MARISHA: Thank you. Thank you. First time comer,
long time lover.

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:43.648
(laughter, applause)

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:45.660
MARISHA: I play Keyleth–

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.161
(cheering)

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.741
MARISHA: The slightly awkward half-elf druid on
Critical Role.

00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:58.432
(applause)

00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:01.002
MATT: Yay! I am Matthew Mercer.

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:04.203
MARISHA and AUDIENCE: Hi Matt!

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:10.893
MATT: Hi guys! I am the Dungeon Master. Thank you!
Most of you know the context, and for those of you

00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:12.491
that don't, we're just not going to explain.

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:15.442
(laughter)

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:20.779
MATT: Yeah. We're a bunch of nerdy-ass voice
actors that play Dungeons &amp; Dragons once a week on

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:30.339
Twitch. The unexpectedly strange networking
phenomenon that has been you guys giving a shit is

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:38.537
incredible, really. Thank you guys for being the
community that made this show anywhere near what

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:45.215
it is! We're excited to be here at MAGFest. It's
our favorite event. I've been coming here for

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:50.398
years, and it's my little video game Mecca every
year that I have to come and try and visit. I'm

00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:59.671
glad you guys could be here for that. I will also
request, as there will be various people in this

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:04.447
room that, one, either haven't watched the show,
or aren't caught up, try and keep any sort of

00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:17.420
questions or discussions as spoiler-free as
possible. Please. Use as much vague innuendo as

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.018
you want to, but if it starts getting a little
intense, I'll call you on it, or Marisha will call

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:22.668
you on it.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.269
MARISHA: I probably won't call you on it.

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.988
MATT: I'll call you on it. We'll be good. Anyway.

00:03:27.988 --> 00:03:31.267
MARISHA: I'm more likely to give a spoiler than
probably anyone else in this room.

00:03:32.427 --> 00:03:34.321
MATT: I was kind of directing it in this
direction.

00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:38.658
MARISHA: Yeah, that was probably more for me than
anybody else. That's a true story.

00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:48.127
MATT: Raise your hand if you have not seen
Critical Role. You are going to be so confused! I

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.247
am excited for your journey this evening!

00:03:50.247 --> 00:03:57.417
MARISHA: Yeah, to that, I'll say: you are all
great friends. Good on you for being drug here.

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:00.928
MATT: You're seriously earning some great friend
points.

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:02.703
MARISHA: They owe you one tomorrow.

00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:05.209
MATT: We're not going to remember tonight
tomorrow.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.196
MARISHA: It's fine.

00:04:09.656 --> 00:04:15.987
MATT: Well, cool. This will be primarily a Q&amp;A.
We'll do a quick overview of how our weird show

00:04:15.987 --> 00:04:20.318
came about and then we'll go into questions from
you guys! I believe we have microphones set up

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:24.437
here in the center of the room, so when we begin
to open to questions, we'll go ahead and have you

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:32.001
guys very calmly and respectfully line up behind
the microphones. We would like to avoid

00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:34.079
clotheslining or pile-driving, unless you are a
Guile cosplayer, which I will allow you one

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:37.454
piledrive. That's the only circumstance.

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:41.836
MARISHA: That's true. In the 30 seconds when
people are running, you turn into lifeguards for a

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:44.518
second like, "No! The concrete's slick!"

00:04:45.948 --> 00:04:49.798
MATT: "Check if he has a pulse! He's alive! We're
good!"

00:04:49.798 --> 00:04:52.128
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's okay. I'm a lifeguard!

00:04:52.128 --> 00:04:55.138
MARISHA: Oh, there! We're good! We're covered!

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:56.880
MATT: What's your name?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.138
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Taylor!

00:04:58.138 --> 00:05:01.300
MATT: Taylor? All right so if anyone gets crushed,
it's Taylor's responsibility.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.348
MARISHA: It's Taylor's fault. I mean, Taylor's
responsibility.

00:05:04.348 --> 00:05:06.438
MATT: To make sure that you're alive. Thank you,
Taylor.

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:07.837
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I can deal with lines. It's no
big deal.

00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:09.369
MATT: Oh great! We're set!

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:13.039
(laughter)

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.108
MATT: What happens if Taylor gets hurt? Do we have
any other lifeguards in here? All right. We're

00:05:19.108 --> 00:05:21.819
good! We are apocalypse-ready.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.928
MARISHA: This is the importance of clerics, you
guys.

00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:30.976
(cheering)

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:34.206
MATT: If anyone watched last night's episode, you
really know the importance of clerics.

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:38.097
(cheering)

00:05:38.097 --> 00:05:43.178
MATT: Oh man. Actually, that's a good call. We
should apologize in advance for our loopy

00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:48.050
mentality right now. We did do our show last
night, left on a seven AM flight this morning with

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.697
a layover.

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:53.287
MARISHA: We tend to not leave the studio until
about 11:30, midnight-ish, anyway.

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:55.068
MATT: Yeah, because I have to unpack everything.

00:05:55.068 --> 00:06:00.649
MARISHA: Then we had to pack up when we got home.
Then you have the adrenaline, so you're like, "I

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:04.718
can't believe Raishan! She's such a bitch!" and
then it's hard to go to sleep.

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:05.560
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.118
MARISHA: That's basically my night every Thursday
night.

00:06:10.118 --> 00:06:13.510
MATT: Yeah. I know I should go to sleep, but this
isn't happening until three.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.769
MARISHA: God damn it.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:22.738
MATT: Well good! I'm glad you suffer with us, in
the best way. (laughter) I'm sorry.

00:06:22.738 --> 00:06:24.831
MARISHA: Oh yeah, you east coasters.

00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.358
(cheering and groaning)

00:06:28.358 --> 00:06:29.200
MARISHA: I know.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.808
MATT: Look, if we did it any earlier, Sam would
just be that much more late.

00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:39.158
MARISHA: It's honestly true. We made that time
specifically because it's the earliest we can do

00:06:39.158 --> 00:06:40.438
to accommodate Sam.

00:06:40.438 --> 00:06:44.590
MATT: Basically, yeah. Mr. DuckTales. For those
who don't know, they announced recently the

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:54.949
DuckTales cast. It's amazing. Sam, our bard, is
the voice director for that series. I'm forever

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.139
jealous of him for that.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.228
MARISHA: Hey, man. He's just slowly turning into
Mr. Disney.

00:06:58.228 --> 00:07:02.990
MATT: I know, but they won't take him from us.
They can try.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.178
MARISHA: Not like NBC did. (crying)

00:07:06.178 --> 00:07:09.220
(awwing)

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.012
MATT: I'm so torn because we want you to support
her show, Blindspot, but if it doesn't come back,

00:07:13.012 --> 00:07:18.839
we get her back. But no! Watch the show. It's a
great show, we want to support her.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.809
MARISHA: It's really great show. But...

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.346
MATT: Selfishly, they need heals.

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:31.439
MARISHA: Look, it's nothing she hasn't said
herself. She's like, "Well, my D&amp;D group, though!"

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.382
MATT: It makes me so happy.

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:38.006
MARISHA: I know. That's how you know you're
winning.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:44.724
MATT: Or I've instilled a poor priority list in
all of my friends. One of the two.

00:07:44.724 --> 00:07:50.575
MARISHA: Biggest job of my career-- D&amp;D group.

00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:59.025
MATT: What could possibly go wrong? Smash cut to
me under an overpass bridge in ten years. Slowly

00:07:59.025 --> 00:08:00.947
rocking inside of a cardboard--

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.645
MARISHA: You'll have all of our Critical Role
T-shirts to keep you warm!

00:08:03.645 --> 00:08:12.056
MATT: Exactly. In the nature of opening the
discussion with you guys, if you do have a

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:16.647
question that's burning in the back of your mind,
calmly and carefully, hopefully without a need of

00:08:16.647 --> 00:08:20.362
the lifeguards, start making your way towards
these microphones in the front. We'll make two

00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:22.415
lines here, and we'll alternate between either
one.

00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:26.636
MARISHA: I love because you were so adamant about
your warning, that everyone was like--

00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:33.428
(laughter)

00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:46.055
MATT: That type of control only comes from being a
Dungeon Master. Yeah, this is true, actually!

00:08:46.055 --> 00:08:53.815
Fantastic. All right. We will do our best to
accommodate as many questions as we can in the

00:08:53.815 --> 00:08:59.164
time we have allotted for this panel, which means
we'll try and be as concise as possible with our

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:03.043
answers, so we can get to as many as possible. I'm
sure there will be many topics we'll ramble on for

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.962
for an extended period of time. We'll do our best
to get to as many as we can. If we don't get to

00:09:06.962 --> 00:09:12.234
your question here, bring it up in another panel.
Even if it's completely not Critical Role-related.

00:09:12.234 --> 00:09:12.834
It's fine.

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:13.546
MARISHA: It's fine.

00:09:14.326 --> 00:09:18.086
MATT: It'll confuse the rest of our panel. You
choose.

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:21.333
MARISHA: Okay, yes, you! Left first.

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:25.076
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I don't know if you can hear me.

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:30.182
MARISHA: I can hear you, you're good! If you want
to tilt the mic down a little bit. There you go. Yeah.

00:09:30.182 --> 00:09:38.918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love the show. I know you guys
are a bunch of theater nerds, which is awesome.

00:09:38.918 --> 00:09:47.845
Yay, theater nerds. I love it when everybody gets
to sing in the show. Sam does it the most, but you

00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:49.259
guys all jump in and it's great.

00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:51.657
MATT: If I ever told myself, "Oh yeah, you'll be
singing musical theater on the internet in front

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:59.019
of thousands of people." I'd be like, "Because I
hate myself? Because I want to be hunted down?" So

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:00.884
thank you that we have an opportunity for this.

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:07.555
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you could cast any musical
with either the cast or the characters, what would

00:10:07.555 --> 00:10:08.056
it be?

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:09.652
MARISHA: If I could cast a musical?

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:13.079
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. If you could put on a
musical.

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:25.668
MARISHA: If I could put on a musical? Ooh. It's
like the power. You go first.

00:10:27.148 --> 00:10:32.340
MATT: We all have our very deep-seated
obsessive love of Hamilton, but--

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.108
MARISHA: It's hard to do Hamilton better.

00:10:36.108 --> 00:10:43.095
MATT: Yeah, that's the thing. I'd say, knowing our
types of humor, and our love of Trey Parker and

00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:44.878
Matt Stone, I'd probably say Book of Mormon.

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:49.969
MARISHA: Yeah. God, that's such a great show.

00:10:49.969 --> 00:10:54.829
MATT and MARISHA: (singing) And a Mormon just
believes!

00:10:57.069 --> 00:11:02.450
MARISHA: If I was to reinvent a musical? Okay, so
you could go one of two ways, right? You could be

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.557
like, I just want to direct this and make the best
version it could possibly be, in its pure state.

00:11:07.557 --> 00:11:17.375
Or you could turn something on its head, like a
terrible musical, like Cats? Now you're giving me

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:23.517
ideas! Maybe I could do a 2017 version of Cats,
and it's like Lol Cats? And it's all internet

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:25.783
memes? You know?

00:11:25.783 --> 00:11:31.756
(laughter)

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:37.106
MARISHA: Come on! That's a good idea! (singing)
Ninja Cats do. And Ninja Cats don't. Ninja Cats

00:11:37.106 --> 00:11:39.006
do. Ninja Cats don't! I don't know.

00:11:39.996 --> 00:11:42.947
MATT: I feel like the cat that had the petal put
on its head, and it saw through infinity.

00:11:42.947 --> 00:11:48.406
MARISHA: That could go into-- That's Magical Mr.
Mistoffelees, right there.

00:11:50.246 --> 00:11:52.941
MATT: Okay, points. I'll give you that.

00:11:52.941 --> 00:11:55.926
MARISHA: Cats. Such a bullshit answer, by the
way.

00:11:58.006 --> 00:11:59.367
MATT and MARISHA: Kickass!

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:00.608
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi!

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:01.315
MATT: Hi!

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:07.775
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just wanted to say thank you so
much for being you guys, and just being wonderful,

00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:13.107
and getting me back into D&amp;D, getting me into 5th
edition, because I'm coming from 3.5, so thank you

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:13.502
for that.

00:12:13.502 --> 00:12:14.158
MATT: Awesome!

00:12:14.158 --> 00:12:26.146
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But! My question is sort of a
merchandise question, because do you spice? Just

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:30.878
hear me out on this one. It's real brief. The
shirt idea is just spice with a question mark.

00:12:30.878 --> 00:12:32.236
MATT: We've had discussions.

00:12:32.236 --> 00:12:36.039
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Please? Because... spice?

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:37.626
MATT: Spice?

00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:41.016
MARISHA: Yeah, we've got plans.

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:51.135
MATT: We'll just put out small packets of
cinnamon. Critical Role brand spice. Or just

00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:53.119
different spices in each package. You don't know
what you're getting!

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:59.009
MARISHA: Oh my god! Can we come out with Critical
Role branded spices? Like, just legit spices? I

00:12:59.009 --> 00:12:59.839
don't know!

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:02.877
MATT: Oh! Or we could have a packet of suude. We
don't tell you how to use it.

00:13:05.617 --> 00:13:09.337
MARISHA: I feel like that's a lawsuit ready to
happen. Right there.

00:13:09.337 --> 00:13:10.735
MATT: Totally worth it.

00:13:10.735 --> 00:13:19.085
MARISHA: Yeah. Tweet all of your complaints at
Geek &amp; Sundry, not at us! Okay, yes!

00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:21.358
SARAH: I'm Sarah, @ThatGamerGrl on Twitter.

00:13:21.358 --> 00:13:22.783
MATT and MARISHA: Hi!

00:13:22.783 --> 00:13:29.185
SARAH: I have a questions mostly for Marisha, but
Matt, since you're currently running the game, you

00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:30.054
can do it too.

00:13:30.054 --> 00:13:30.787
MATT: Okay.

00:13:30.787 --> 00:13:36.357
SARAH: Female gamers know that it's difficult
being us. It's particularly difficult when you're

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:42.826
the significant other of the male gamer, and even
more so when your significant other is the DM.

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:56.510
Somehow other players don't think that you're
there for the game. They think you're there for

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.685
your boy or trying to pretend you want to be
there-- you know.

00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:03.035
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah. All the things.

00:14:03.035 --> 00:14:08.010
SARAH: Also, they think we have advanced knowledge
and get special treatment, all that sort of thing.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.620
MARISHA: Yep, and "Did you make him sleep on the
couch?" How many times have I heard that one?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.718
(laughter)

00:14:17.718 --> 00:14:18.558
MARISHA: Anyway, keep going.

00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:22.317
SARAH: Obviously, you've dealt with this before.
How have you dealt with it? Matt, how have you

00:14:22.317 --> 00:14:24.198
helped deal with it at the table?

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:28.536
MARISHA: That's a good question. There's been a
few times, I think there was a little bit there

00:14:28.536 --> 00:14:33.826
for a while, that even our fellow game players
were like, "Marisha, you know something!" And I

00:14:33.826 --> 00:14:42.144
was like, "I would love it if he talked to me, you
guys, but he just doesn't."

00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:46.998
MATT: She'll come into my office at times, when
I'm working on game stuff, and she'll be like,

00:14:46.998 --> 00:14:50.796
"Hey Matt," and I'll be like, "Don't look! Don't
look at me!"

00:14:50.796 --> 00:14:54.876
MARISHA: It's a little like, "Mom! You're supposed
to knock!"

00:14:54.876 --> 00:14:58.542
MATT: Pushing maps in the corner, "(shushing)
What?!"

00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:09.146
MARISHA: Yeah, he does, a lot. He does that. It's
all true. That's what's funny about it. Yeah, but

00:15:09.146 --> 00:15:14.989
I've gotten that, people have been like, "Oh, is
Matt going easier on her?" and there's also

00:15:14.989 --> 00:15:20.007
certain people who have said the opposite, of
like, they think he's being harder on me in order

00:15:20.007 --> 00:15:27.957
to really prove that he's not being easier on me.
You know, so it's a Catch-22, but luckily I think

00:15:27.957 --> 00:15:33.016
there's especially a lot of us who're starting to
come out of the woodwork these days, and we're

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:40.217
like, no, we're on the level. We're cool. We have
a pretty good separate DM-and-player relationship.

00:15:40.217 --> 00:15:42.251
And we try to respect it.

00:15:42.251 --> 00:15:45.991
MATT: And respect is the key, because when you
consider that a person is at the table to play the

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:50.500
game, they want to play it for the challenges and
the same level as everyone else does. And yeah,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.257
you might say, "Oh, they get special treatment,"
it's like, you're disrespecting her and her

00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:59.976
interest in being a gamer and wanting to come at
this at the same level of challenge that everybody

00:15:59.976 --> 00:16:02.710
else is. So it's just being able to distinguish
that difference and respect as players at the

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:03.936
table that that's not the case.

00:16:03.936 --> 00:16:08.472
MARISHA: Yeah, cheating's not fun. That's what
people have always said. "Do you go into his

00:16:08.472 --> 00:16:12.976
notes? Do you sneak into his notes, into his
binders?" I'm like, no. That's dumb.

00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:14.240
MATT: I have that shit alarmed.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.255
(laughter)

00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:18.808
MATT: I'd know.

00:16:18.808 --> 00:16:20.786
SARAH: Thank you very much.

00:16:20.786 --> 00:16:22.169
MATT: No worries, good question.

00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:27.205
(cheering)

00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:29.005
MATT: Hello, sir. You look so dapper.

00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:31.407
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, I came from the bar to be
here. You met my wife?

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:38.885
(applause, laughter)

00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:40.425
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How are we doing? Drinks good?

00:16:41.515 --> 00:16:42.732
MATT: Hi, what's your question?

00:16:42.732 --> 00:16:44.053
MARISHA: You have our attention.

00:16:44.053 --> 00:16:46.592
(laughter)

00:16:46.592 --> 00:16:48.776
MARISHA: Your wife's still alive, right? Nah, keep
going.

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:51.844
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She took a lovely picture with
you and sent it to me while I was sitting here.

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.485
MATT and MARISHA: Oh!

00:16:55.525 --> 00:16:57.305
MARISHA: So much more makes sense.

00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:00.788
(laughter)

00:17:00.788 --> 00:17:03.140
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, Matt met my wife.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:09.724
MATT: I was like, did I black out for half an
hour? Because I'm an asshole? Anyway, you had a question?

00:17:09.985 --> 00:17:14.395
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, first off, I just wanted to
thank you guys very much-- or blame you guys, I

00:17:14.395 --> 00:17:20.994
don't know. I'm currently in five games, co-DMing
two, DM-ing one. I blame you mostly.

00:17:20.994 --> 00:17:23.376
MATT: I am sorry, and you're welcome.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:28.226
(laughter)

00:17:28.226 --> 00:17:31.428
MARISHA: You just read that off like major-league
baseball stats.

00:17:31.428 --> 00:17:34.090
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I had to compute it, because
people are like, "Hey, do you have room for a

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:45.007
game, blah-blah-blah," and I was like, "No." But I
just wanted to-- it's a thank you, mostly. It's

00:17:45.007 --> 00:17:47.177
been great. And being back into RP is just
awesome.

00:17:47.177 --> 00:17:50.887
MATT: Welcome back. And let me tell you, how long
have you been playing, approximately?

00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:56.273
AUDIENCE MEMBER: See, that's the thing. When I was
a kid, Boy Scouts, I stole one of the 2nd ed, I

00:17:56.273 --> 00:17:58.827
think it was Gods and something books from one of
my friends.

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:00.225
MATT: Deities and Demigods.

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:01.851
MARISHA: Good for you. It was better off in your
hands.

00:18:01.851 --> 00:18:05.520
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But I never got to be in games
when I was that age. There was just nobody around.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.354
MATT: But that's the thing, though. We're going
into an age now where not only is the game more

00:18:10.354 --> 00:18:14.106
accessible to a larger audience, but there's less
of that stigma to discuss it, and people are more

00:18:14.106 --> 00:18:18.612
interested in either getting back into it or
finally learning what it actually is, and it's

00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:22.945
actually a lot of fun. When I grew up, like you
said, you're in five games now. That would be

00:18:22.945 --> 00:18:25.066
insane to me when I was 14!

00:18:25.066 --> 00:18:27.071
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, it's insane now, don't
worry.

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:31.169
MATT: Yeah, it was like spotting a UFO, you're
like, "Wait, wait. You know somebody else who

00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:37.979
"plays D&amp;D? You don't want to join our group? No?
That's fine."

00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:40.360
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've already gotten the question
three times this-- but no, I had a

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.411
question-question. This is with DMing. When you
have a group and they write nice backstories and

00:18:45.411 --> 00:18:50.671
then you go and say, okay, I can create this
around all of this, and then it's like, okay, now

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:56.421
whose do I do and will that piss off everybody
else whose backstory doesn't time yet? Say if

00:18:56.421 --> 00:18:59.350
someone is on a vision quest or something for a
long time.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.081
MARISHA: Those damn vision quests.

00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:07.037
MATT: Whose backstory do you choose? Like, what
order to go in?

00:19:07.037 --> 00:19:09.984
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, like do you have some way
that you try to prioritize that?

00:19:10.804 --> 00:19:14.928
MATT: I think it depends on their backstories and
considering what level of difficulty that might

00:19:14.928 --> 00:19:19.787
come to fruition in. If someone's backstory deals
with a drug lord that crossed their family and

00:19:19.787 --> 00:19:23.575
they're trying to get vengeance on them, that
could be a fairly low-level encounter that could

00:19:23.575 --> 00:19:28.550
have some long-running background elements you
could tie into the future. If someone's like,

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:34.333
"Well, my backstory is I had one of the evil gods
devour my people on a continent that sank into the

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:39.236
ocean," you're like, probably not getting to that
until the later levels. So that does help at least

00:19:39.236 --> 00:19:45.664
prioritize somewhat, at least as far as the scale
of the group's power. If there isn't that

00:19:45.664 --> 00:19:52.087
easy-to-discovery priority list per se, then see
if there's any that you can combine, see if

00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:56.176
there's a plot from one backstory and another that
they thought were completely unrelated that

00:19:56.176 --> 00:20:04.484
suddenly tie into being the same group or the same
villain, or perhaps it's fate that came together

00:20:04.484 --> 00:20:12.037
for this specific purpose. Or just tell a player,
hold off a while. Be respectful. I can't do

00:20:12.037 --> 00:20:14.566
everybody's story at once. This is going to turn
into The Wire.

00:20:14.566 --> 00:20:17.215
(laughter)

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:21.425
MATT: So yeah. That would be my biggest
recommendation. It's a hard balance, it really is.

00:20:21.425 --> 00:20:26.546
I haven't had the opportunity to get too deep
into-- I've touched a bit on Scanlan's story and

00:20:26.546 --> 00:20:32.036
Pike, she just hasn't been around. But the first
player to really get a heavy backstory element

00:20:32.036 --> 00:20:37.996
after two and a half years of gaming was Percy. Up
to that point, I hadn't really tied anyone's

00:20:37.996 --> 00:20:41.824
backstory into it so heavily, so don't feel like
it's something you have to frontload, either.

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:46.929
MARISHA: I think the twins kind of went first,
because their dad happened to be, like, the

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:48.135
president of Syngorn.

00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:50.045
MATT: Ambassador.

00:20:50.045 --> 00:20:54.946
MARISHA: Which is kind of like one of our
neighboring towns, so we wound up dealing with

00:20:54.946 --> 00:20:59.055
some of their stuff at the home game. And I
remember the first time, when they were like,

00:20:59.055 --> 00:21:04.646
"Hello, father," and we were all like, "What?!"
Because they didn't tell us that.

00:21:04.646 --> 00:21:06.346
MATT: It was like a Maury episode, yeah.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:10.986
MARISHA: Because that was the first time we'd
really gotten to anyone's backstory stuff, so we

00:21:10.986 --> 00:21:13.367
were like, "Plot twist!" Anyway. Continue.

00:21:13.367 --> 00:21:18.324
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, that was the main part of
the question. Thank you. Thank you guys so much

00:21:18.324 --> 00:21:20.762
for what you do. It's great, and I look forward to
it every week.

00:21:20.762 --> 00:21:22.080
MATT and MARISHA: Thank you.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.766
MATT: And good on you for taking up the mantle of
helping dungeon master other games. I can't

00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:33.674
emphasize it enough. For so many years, I've known
people who were afraid to pick up the mantle of

00:21:33.674 --> 00:21:39.666
the dungeon master. It is daunting, it seems, but
it's a thrill in its own right to create a story,

00:21:39.666 --> 00:21:45.015
to create a space for your friends to play in, and
that's your gift to them, and let them live and

00:21:45.015 --> 00:21:50.096
breathe and write stories within that space that
you created is-- there's no feeling quite like it.

00:21:50.096 --> 00:21:53.216
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, and on the other note,
there's always the thing of, "I have all this

00:21:53.216 --> 00:21:56.294
stuff created and I can't tell you this yet, we're
not there yet."

00:21:56.294 --> 00:22:01.344
MATT: I know. But once you wait for the right
moment to release it and you go, "Here," and they

00:22:01.344 --> 00:22:07.099
all go, "What?!" you're like, "Yeah." I don't know
which mic to drop. There's like six at the table.

00:22:07.099 --> 00:22:08.183
(laughter)

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.880
MATT: But yeah, you know what I mean. Good
question.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.717
(applause)

00:22:13.717 --> 00:22:19.233
MARISHA: Yeah, I remember when you went to go get
drinks with Eric, who's my writer for Signal

00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:24.044
Boost, and you were like, "Hey man, I'd really
love to go get drinks," and he was like, "Oh.

00:22:24.044 --> 00:22:28.514
Okay, yeah, sure, man. I've never really hung out
one-on-one, I'm not sure what he wants to talk to

00:22:28.514 --> 00:22:35.885
me about." And then his side is that you sat him
down and you were like, "Dude. Okay. Here's what

00:22:35.885 --> 00:22:38.784
I'm planning for their campaign, and I have to
tell someone."

00:22:38.784 --> 00:22:41.263
(laughter)

00:22:41.263 --> 00:22:43.436
MARISHA: And you dumped the entire campaign on
him.

00:22:43.436 --> 00:22:46.555
MATT: Yeah, I think him, Matt Colville, and Chris
Perkins are the only people that know what the

00:22:46.555 --> 00:22:47.954
next arc in your campaign is.

00:22:47.954 --> 00:22:50.056
MARISHA: Once again, can't talk to anybody.

00:22:50.056 --> 00:22:55.625
MATT: I'm tempted, like, time to steal some money!
Or I'm just going to melt down.

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:58.025
MARISHA: Yeah, Eric came back with gray hair, he'd
seen the future.

00:23:00.025 --> 00:23:04.954
MATT: Snow-blind, aged 40 years. He had no legs,
it was weird.

00:23:04.954 --> 00:23:08.275
(laughter)

00:23:08.275 --> 00:23:09.915
MATT: Next question.

00:23:09.915 --> 00:23:15.775
SHO: Hi, my name is Sho. I started playing
Dungeons and Dragons two years ago, a little over

00:23:15.775 --> 00:23:21.826
two years ago, in the summer. I started off as a
DM of my friends. I started off with eight people, actually.

00:23:21.826 --> 00:23:23.583
MARISHA: You started as a DM?

00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:25.085
SHO: I started as a DM, yeah.

00:23:25.085 --> 00:23:27.065
MATT: Talk about training with weights on, dude.
Damn!

00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:29.986
SHO: It lasted two days.

00:23:29.986 --> 00:23:32.454
(laughter)

00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:33.545
MATT: Very fast workout.

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:38.873
SHO: But currently, right now, I'm playing with a
very good group of people. We're playing through A

00:23:38.873 --> 00:23:43.074
Tyranny of Dragons right now, and I'm working on a
campaign on the side that I'm also keeping locked

00:23:43.074 --> 00:23:50.077
down and secret, you know? But my real question is
general for the both of you guys, whether DMing or

00:23:50.077 --> 00:23:56.495
just as a player, what is your favorite monster
out of all, whether to fight or to just use?

00:23:59.085 --> 00:24:00.246
MATT: You first.

00:24:01.596 --> 00:24:09.016
MARISHA: I love displacer beasts, just because
they're displacer kitties. They're so cute. Oh,

00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:13.862
you're so scary, aren't you? You think you're
scary. That's how you beat displacer beasts.

00:24:13.862 --> 00:24:15.485
You're just like, "You're scary!"

00:24:16.825 --> 00:24:21.295
MATT: Oh, you're going to hate them when you're
back to your new campaign at level three.

00:24:21.295 --> 00:24:27.424
MARISHA: Yeah, totally. No, they were really hard
at level three. Also, I mean, beholders. Beholders

00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:35.462
are iconically amazing and hard to fight and each
one is a little tactically different. I love that.

00:24:35.472 --> 00:24:41.123
MATT: Yeah, they're hyper-paranoid, they're just
strange and dangerous. Those are fun. All of those

00:24:41.123 --> 00:24:41.772
are good choices.

00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:43.401
MARISHA: What about you?

00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:43.984
MATT: Look.

00:24:43.984 --> 00:24:46.391
(laughter)

00:24:46.391 --> 00:24:51.823
MATT: I have yet to be able to use it in a
campaign, and when I opened the 2nd Edition

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:56.014
Monster Manual in my freshman year of high school
and I saw the Godzilla-like artwork, I fell in

00:24:56.014 --> 00:24:57.440
love immediately with the tarrasque.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.793
(cheering)

00:25:00.793 --> 00:25:05.394
MATT: I like the idea of an entity that is such a
powerful force of nature on such a mythological

00:25:05.394 --> 00:25:11.043
level that it just slumbers beneath the surface of
the world and emerges once every generation or so

00:25:11.043 --> 00:25:18.457
to rise up and eat, for weeks, anything in its
path. Until eventually, it's either defeated, or

00:25:18.457 --> 00:25:23.424
it's quelled its hunger and then slumbers back
into the core of the earth again, supposedly on an

00:25:23.424 --> 00:25:29.766
infinite loop, for all of time. That's fun. Also,
hyper-magic resistant, vorpal bite, trample

00:25:29.766 --> 00:25:30.697
attacks. It's fun.

00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:32.591
MARISHA: So fun. Super fun.

00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:34.253
MATT: Hope they never run into one.

00:25:34.253 --> 00:25:35.632
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Final boss!

00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:38.872
MATT: Good question.

00:25:38.872 --> 00:25:39.971
SHO: Yeah, thanks so much.

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:44.192
MATT: Thanks, buddy. You sir!

00:25:44.192 --> 00:25:46.521
HEATH: Hi, my name is Heath.

00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:47.331
MATT: Hey, Zeke!

00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:49.443
HEATH: Heath. Heath. Like the candy bar.

00:25:51.173 --> 00:25:53.413
MATT: Oh! Heath. I misunderstood that.

00:25:53.413 --> 00:25:53.993
HEATH: Everyone does.

00:25:55.203 --> 00:25:56.734
MATT: As a fan of Heath bars, I'm sorry.

00:25:56.734 --> 00:25:58.854
HEATH: Anthony Burch, last year, he got it the
first try.

00:25:58.854 --> 00:26:01.533
MATT: Did he really? Anthony!

00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:03.254
MARISHA: Damn it, Anthony. Smart guy.

00:26:04.924 --> 00:26:11.624
HEATH: My question goes to both of you. What
moment in D&amp;D gave you the greatest impact outside

00:26:11.624 --> 00:26:12.223
the game?

00:26:14.693 --> 00:26:18.491
(laughter)

00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:20.323
MARISHA: No pressure or anything.

00:26:24.503 --> 00:26:28.571
(laughter)

00:26:28.571 --> 00:26:31.660
MARISHA: It's like-- Should we know this ahead of
time?

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.552
(laughter)

00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:34.576
MARISHA: I feel like we should.

00:26:34.576 --> 00:26:39.855
HEATH: If it makes you feel better, this was a
secondary question. My initial question would have

00:26:39.855 --> 00:26:42.272
gone to the excremancer, Scanlan.

00:26:43.992 --> 00:26:44.812
MATT: Excremancer.

00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:48.553
(laughter)

00:26:49.283 --> 00:26:50.033
HEATH: But he's not here!

00:26:51.273 --> 00:26:56.512
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I couldn't even attempt to
answer a question like Sam can, so I'm not even

00:26:56.512 --> 00:26:57.124
going to try.

00:26:58.994 --> 00:27:03.442
MATT: I would say two moments for me. One's going
to be legitimate, one's going to be a little

00:27:03.442 --> 00:27:07.153
cheesy. The legitimate one is the moment that I
decided to become a dungeon master, as a

00:27:07.153 --> 00:27:12.421
performer, because it was a lot of pressure, but
it also allowed me a space where I could create

00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:17.103
and understand so many different varying character
personalities from my imagination and give them

00:27:17.103 --> 00:27:21.766
life, give them a voice, give them a personality,
and play in that space. It helped me hone a lot of

00:27:21.766 --> 00:27:26.513
the skills that I still use today as a
professional performer. So deciding to be a

00:27:26.513 --> 00:27:31.003
dungeon master-- In a space where the only
experience I had was one dude who was a really bad

00:27:31.003 --> 00:27:37.074
dungeon master, and I became one out of spite as a
reaction to his campaign. Really nice guy, but

00:27:37.074 --> 00:27:42.552
just not that great of a storyteller. That was
important to me. Honestly, it sounds cheesy, but

00:27:42.552 --> 00:27:47.772
the moment that we decided to do the livestream.
It went against a lot of our instincts for such a

00:27:47.772 --> 00:27:52.412
personal game and we were like, "I don't know,
man." We all had our brushes with the internet,

00:27:52.412 --> 00:28:00.103
and the internet being a mob of flaming torches
and pitchforks. We were like, "Okay, do we want to

00:28:00.103 --> 00:28:05.352
set us up for this kind of heartbreak?" I think
our decision to take it to the stream and hope for

00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:07.722
the best led to two years of this.

00:28:08.942 --> 00:28:15.123
(applause)

00:28:16.223 --> 00:28:24.673
MARISHA: I have one of my new revelations with
Keyleth is-- I've said this a couple times, but I

00:28:24.673 --> 00:28:29.734
genuinely feel like ever since I've embodied
Keyleth, and especially more so since the stream

00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:35.528
started because we play more on a weekly basis, I
genuinely feel like she's made me a more

00:28:35.528 --> 00:28:42.254
empathetic and compassionate person. Because me,
personally, I'm more closed off and a little bit

00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:53.142
more-- I'm more introverted. I have my social
anxieties. Keyleth helped me get that first

00:28:53.142 --> 00:28:58.063
instinct. Because her first instinct is always,
"I'm going to do whatever I can for the betterment

00:28:58.063 --> 00:29:07.108
of other people." That's not necessarily my first
instinct. She taught me a lot, genuinely, about

00:29:07.108 --> 00:29:13.810
that. Then I remember even the moment that I had
with Patrick Rothfuss on stream. Which I don't

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.391
want to, like-- Once again, no spoilers.

00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:18.962
(applause)

00:29:19.642 --> 00:29:29.382
MARISHA: Yeah. Patrick, my new best friend. That's
our joke. He's my friend now. Because it's Patrick

00:29:29.382 --> 00:29:40.443
Rothfuss. That moment. That was amazing because
Patrick and I didn't really know each other aside

00:29:40.443 --> 00:29:44.608
from acquaintances before he came on the stream.
That was really the first time we had really met.

00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:53.623
Before that episode started, he was by the coffee
machine in the lobby, in the kitchen in our area,

00:29:53.623 --> 00:30:00.534
in our green room. He was like, "Marisha. I don't
know if I can do this." I was like, "What do you

00:30:00.534 --> 00:30:08.392
mean, man? It's fine." He's like, "No, you guys
are so funny, and you're witty. You guys are so

00:30:08.392 --> 00:30:16.874
quick, and I don't know." I was like, "Dude,
you're Patrick Rothfuss! What?! No-- Man, it's

00:30:16.874 --> 00:30:22.843
going to be great. You're going to get in there
and maybe-- You'll be fine after a few minutes."

00:30:22.843 --> 00:30:29.812
Then he told me afterwards-- This turned into a
tangent, I'm sorry. We brought him in in the

00:30:29.812 --> 00:30:38.102
middle of the episode, and earlier that episode
Keyleth was having problems with her morality, and

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:44.737
the hero-worship, and trying to figure out if what
she was doing was actually helping, instead of

00:30:44.737 --> 00:30:51.992
just that surface helping like Windex. Patrick
told me after that, he was like, "When I saw

00:30:51.992 --> 00:31:03.013
Keyleth going through that, I was like, 'Okay.
That's where Kerr is going to have his entry

00:31:03.013 --> 00:31:05.648
point, and that's where they can relate.'" Of
course, it's all improv. I had no idea any of that

00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:11.132
was going to happen. That was such a
transformative moment for I think both me and

00:31:11.132 --> 00:31:18.072
Keyleth. He really got Keyleth out of a rut after
that. That was just-- I'll never forget that

00:31:18.072 --> 00:31:18.687
moment. Never.

00:31:18.687 --> 00:31:27.203
(applause)

00:31:27.484 --> 00:31:31.453
MATT: Thank you for the question. Hello!

00:31:31.453 --> 00:31:33.085
MARISHA: Sorry, I talked for a long time on that
one.

00:31:33.181 --> 00:31:34.392
MATT: That's okay.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:35.038
MARISHA: Keep going.

00:31:35.038 --> 00:31:38.973
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. I'm going to be really
nervous. First, congratulations on your engagement.

00:31:39.004 --> 00:31:47.271
(cheering)

00:31:47.271 --> 00:31:54.182
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Wish you guys a life of love and
happiness together. I've been married ten years,

00:31:54.182 --> 00:31:57.311
and it's awesome. May you always roll crit 20s.

00:31:57.311 --> 00:32:02.746
(awwing)

00:32:02.746 --> 00:32:10.532
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're adorable and just
inspiring. My question is for Keyleth. It's very

00:32:10.532 --> 00:32:16.030
noticeable that you've grown and changed. I wanted
you to talk a little bit about how your

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:21.669
interactions with the other characters-- There's a
moment that comes to mind, with you and Vex, that

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:23.181
was like sisters.

00:32:23.181 --> 00:32:24.039
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:32.222
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Especially now that you're dating
somebody in the party. How has her relationship

00:32:32.222 --> 00:32:38.825
with other members of the group changed,
especially now that she's in that really emotional relationship?

00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:45.155
MARISHA: That's a great question. Keyleth has
always felt like the odd man out, you know? Once

00:32:45.155 --> 00:32:53.841
again, she'll always go with the flow, unless she
feels like it's real bad, guys. Like, "Maybe we

00:32:53.841 --> 00:33:02.982
should really think about this." I've had a few
people in the interwebs be like, "Why does Keyleth

00:33:02.982 --> 00:33:08.772
always have to disagree with everybody?" She
doesn't, actually. It's just that she doesn't

00:33:08.772 --> 00:33:15.381
really speak up a lot of the times. You're
literally only remembering the times that she

00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:22.383
does? It's taken her a while to get that courage
to be that kind of a person. She also thinks--

00:33:22.383 --> 00:33:28.409
It's not that she thinks. She knows-- I know--
she's the least coolest member of the group.

00:33:28.409 --> 00:33:30.154
(awwing)

00:33:30.154 --> 00:33:40.483
MARISHA: Come on, you guys. That's true! For Vex,
Keyleth looks at Vex and she's like, "Oh my god.

00:33:40.483 --> 00:33:47.160
She's the It Girl. She's so cool, man." She's the
popular girl. I know the moment you're talking

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.091
about, and I remember that. Any time I think
Keyleth gets a little bit of that popular girl

00:33:53.091 --> 00:34:00.320
attention-- The internet has also picked up on
that a little bit, too. It's just the twins, man.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:08.377
They get people going. You know? She, like Vax
says-- In a weird way they're the perfect

00:34:08.377 --> 00:34:16.271
dichotomy of each other, because Vex still has
that-- She's just such a badass. She's the Han

00:34:16.271 --> 00:34:23.262
Solo of our group, man. She's just fucking cool.
As time's gone on, I think she's gotten more

00:34:23.262 --> 00:34:28.550
comfortable, but maybe one day Keyleth will be
cool. Maybe one day.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.512
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She's always cool.

00:34:30.512 --> 00:34:33.351
MARISHA: Hey, that's her purpose. That's her role!
It's good.

00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:35.844
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She's amazing, and thank you guys
so much.

00:34:35.844 --> 00:34:43.591
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you.

00:34:43.591 --> 00:34:44.663
MATT: Hello!

00:34:44.663 --> 00:34:46.573
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Speaking of couples that game
together, my husband and I have been gaming

00:34:46.573 --> 00:34:49.801
together for about 13 years, and we have five
games going between the two of us.

00:34:49.801 --> 00:34:51.512
MATT: Nice! Congrats.

00:34:51.512 --> 00:34:58.347
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, heaven help us. Basically,
a couple years ago at MAGFest they had a panel

00:34:58.347 --> 00:35:04.011
called Beyond D&amp;D. We learned about a few games
there. There's a lot of games out there that are

00:35:04.011 --> 00:35:09.420
similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the mechanics,
but we then learned about a bunch of games that

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:16.642
are completely different. Things like Dungeon
World, where it's moves and 2d6, and Dread, where

00:35:16.642 --> 00:35:20.343
it's a Jenga tower instead of dice. I was
wondering if you guys have played games like that,

00:35:20.343 --> 00:35:24.190
either those two or other ones, and what you think
about those style of games.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.713
MATT: I played a number of systems growing up. D&amp;D
was my first introduction into RPG and will always

00:35:33.713 --> 00:35:40.132
be my dearest, because it for a lot of people was
the introduction and the kickstart moment of the

00:35:40.132 --> 00:35:49.192
genre as a whole. I grew up playing the Palladium
universe, for better or for worse, through Rifts,

00:35:49.192 --> 00:35:57.460
which is broken in its own right. I love Call of
Cthulhu tremendously. Dungeon World's a great

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:03.837
system, actually. I've only had the opportunity in
recent years to try that one out. Exalted was fun

00:36:03.837 --> 00:36:09.346
because you play an anime character being
ridiculous. You get more benefits for having the

00:36:09.346 --> 00:36:14.640
most ridiculous combos, like, "That's even cooler?
Then you get more cool <i>because</i> you're so cool.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:20.472
Because anime." Exalted is fun in that regard. A
lot of the White Wolf stuff. World of Darkness is

00:36:20.472 --> 00:36:21.200
a lot of fun.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.785
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We played White Wolf for a very
long time. Exalted was always great. We had that

00:36:26.785 --> 00:36:30.989
one-shot boss where we killed him in one shot and
the GM was looking at a sheet and we were like,

00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:34.111
"Did we kill him?" He drew three more more health
boxes and was like, "No."

00:36:37.961 --> 00:36:45.942
MATT: That's awesome. I've played a lot of
terrible systems. I played a one-shot in a world

00:36:45.942 --> 00:36:52.634
called Synnibarr, which is one of the worst games
ever made, and I played it because of that. It

00:36:52.634 --> 00:36:55.564
already had that reputation and I was like, "I at
least have to try this once," and it lived up to

00:36:55.564 --> 00:37:02.131
its reputation. It made Rifts look super
streamlined, beautiful, and cohesive as far as

00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:07.020
worldbuilding. It was incredible. Marisha?

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:14.241
MARISHA: Yeah, of course we had our Pathfinder
game before we switched over. He was also my first

00:37:14.241 --> 00:37:24.891
Dungeon Master. It was before we were dating. You
actually DMed for me and my boyfriend at the time.

00:37:24.891 --> 00:37:26.391
That's true.

00:37:26.391 --> 00:37:31.811
MATT: Yeah. That wasn't the intent! That was a
year and half before we started dating!

00:37:31.811 --> 00:37:33.612
MARISHA: That's also true.

00:37:35.522 --> 00:37:38.452
MATT: It wasn't! I'm a good boy!

00:37:38.452 --> 00:37:43.880
(laughter)

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.689
MATT: It was very respectful. I was crushing on
her hardcore, but very respectful!

00:37:47.689 --> 00:37:53.016
(awwing)

00:37:53.036 --> 00:37:53.972
MATT: (pathetic horn blowing)

00:37:58.012 --> 00:38:00.461
MARISHA: Was that a Matt Mercer horn? That's
amazing.

00:38:01.261 --> 00:38:06.001
MATT: Shut up! Continue answering your question.

00:38:06.771 --> 00:38:14.596
MARISHA: Anyway, we played Pathfinder. I played a
Buffy the Vampire system for a while, which was

00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:22.856
fun. Together, if you step outside of RPGs for a
bit-- in terms of couple gaming-- we play Mansions

00:38:22.856 --> 00:38:28.187
of Madness all the time. Mansions of Madness is
great, and they just came out with a new system

00:38:28.187 --> 00:38:35.785
that's amazing, a second edition. We also play a
lot of Minecraft together because it's our come

00:38:35.785 --> 00:38:45.039
home from a 14 hour day and need to zone out and
hit blocks for an hour. It's our zen thing, and

00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:51.165
you get the nice Minecraft zen meditation music.
You're like, "This is almost like a spa."

00:38:55.665 --> 00:38:59.676
MATT: Couples that stay in their pajamas playing
Minecraft together I think is a very therapeutic

00:38:59.676 --> 00:39:04.955
experience for the two of you. I highly recommend
it. If it's a rainy day outside, get yourself a

00:39:04.955 --> 00:39:09.985
cup of coffee, sit there, and be like, "Hey babe,
you want to build a castle out of this mountain?

00:39:09.985 --> 00:39:10.903
Let's do it."

00:39:10.903 --> 00:39:12.886
MARISHA: "Oh my god, that's the best! Yes I do!"

00:39:12.886 --> 00:39:14.394
MATT: "Let's raise some sheep."

00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:17.838
MARISHA: "Oh man, you get the cows. I'll get the
sheep."

00:39:17.838 --> 00:39:20.695
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We play HotS so that I can take
over towers as Ragnaros.

00:39:20.695 --> 00:39:25.977
MARISHA: Yeah we play WoW together too. Totally.
Good times.

00:39:25.977 --> 00:39:29.885
(cheering)

00:39:29.885 --> 00:39:33.413
MATT: Hello! Oh, it's Becca! Becca's our OG
Critter.

00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:36.897
MARISHA: Hi! The light was obscuring you a little
bit. I can see you now-- can't really see you now.

00:39:36.897 --> 00:39:38.075
I can see you now.

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:41.165
MATT: Just so you guys know, Becca, I think, was
legitimately the first Critter we met at a

00:39:41.165 --> 00:39:44.833
convention after the show had originally launched.
Becca's been there from the beginning.

00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:46.425
MARISHA: It's true, yeah.

00:39:46.425 --> 00:39:49.448
(cheering)

00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:55.178
BECCA: That was two years ago in March. That was a
long time ago. My question is actually about your

00:39:55.178 --> 00:40:01.976
playlists that you guys started doing, because I
love them and I've probably listened to Vex's

00:40:01.976 --> 00:40:12.638
first one and Keyleth's first one more than enough
times. My question is: obviously you guys make

00:40:12.638 --> 00:40:21.524
them with your characters in mind, but I wanted to
know how much of your own personal favorite genres

00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:26.514
and stuff like that also influence what went into
the playlists.

00:40:28.004 --> 00:40:31.450
MARISHA: That's a good question. To preface a
little bit about what she's talking about, in case

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:38.284
you didn't know, all of us put out character
Spotify playlists to help give you a little more

00:40:38.284 --> 00:40:42.157
insight into some of our characters. We did it
last year, and we're right in the middle of our

00:40:42.157 --> 00:40:47.625
second round because, quite frankly, we enjoy
doing them so much, and we wanted to do it again.

00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:56.776
We're all music lovers. Who's not a music lover?
This is MAGFest! Everyone here's got to be a music

00:40:56.776 --> 00:41:08.206
lover! We wanted to do it again. You can all find
them on Geek &amp; Sundry Spotify. I actually went

00:41:08.206 --> 00:41:14.702
searching a decent amount for a lot of my stuff.
It definitely has a lot of my musical influences.

00:41:14.702 --> 00:41:20.678
My dad raised me on a lot of bluegrass, and
classic rock, and folk, and things like that. I

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:32.208
grew up in Kentucky-- this part of the woods, you
guys! They're all songs that I love and definitely

00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:40.516
speak to my influence of music, but still very
much have that Keyleth taste. We get really anal

00:41:40.516 --> 00:41:48.974
retentive about them. We'll be like, "No. It's not
perfect enough. It's close, but not enough." We've

00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:51.975
spent months on those, finding the perfect songs.

00:41:52.725 --> 00:41:55.145
MATT: I just picked songs that I knew and liked.

00:41:57.215 --> 00:41:58.284
MARISHA: That's not true.

00:41:59.274 --> 00:42:01.585
MATT: No, there was a little bit of searching.

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:05.655
MARISHA: You had an even harder time because you
were doing the NPC playlists. You had one or two

00:42:05.655 --> 00:42:07.757
songs per character, which is hard.

00:42:07.757 --> 00:42:11.594
MATT: Yeah, it was like, "How do I encompass an
entire NPC's personality in one song?" I chose

00:42:11.594 --> 00:42:16.764
elements of each, and it was hard to do. A lot of
mine were songs that I already knew or I was a fan

00:42:16.764 --> 00:42:21.254
of the bands and picked one that fit for those
characters, and then a lot of searching as well.

00:42:21.254 --> 00:42:25.708
I'll be doing a second list soon. Should be
interesting.

00:42:25.708 --> 00:42:28.166
BECCA: Bangarang was my favorite one off of
yours.

00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:32.865
MARISHA: Wait, which one? Oh, Bangarang? Oh yeah,
that's a good one.

00:42:32.865 --> 00:42:33.556
BECCA: Thanks.

00:42:35.236 --> 00:42:42.538
MATT: Thank you, Becca. I think we can get all
these questions done in the next seven minutes.

00:42:42.538 --> 00:42:44.609
There's a panel after this, right?

00:42:44.609 --> 00:42:45.806
MARISHA: Are you Gilmore?

00:42:45.806 --> 00:42:46.535
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I am!

00:42:46.535 --> 00:42:55.034
MATT: Damn right you are! That's amazing! (Gilmore
voice) "If I do say so myself, you look glorious."

00:42:55.034 --> 00:43:00.793
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Absolutely. Actually, Marisha,
you answered my original question. Just curious

00:43:00.793 --> 00:43:05.798
about whether Keyleth's playstyle was something
that came naturally to you or if you really had to

00:43:05.798 --> 00:43:08.646
think about what Keyleth did. I think that
watching her growth through this series has been

00:43:08.646 --> 00:43:13.798
such a delight. I've been binge watching, so it's
been a little rapid-fire for me. I wanted to thank

00:43:13.798 --> 00:43:20.361
you for that. Matt, we've seen all these wonderful
NPCs come through that maybe you had a plan for,

00:43:20.361 --> 00:43:24.925
maybe were small and got away from you and ended
up a little longer than you thought they would in

00:43:24.925 --> 00:43:30.236
the series. I was wondering if you would share
with us a quirk, a tidbit of backstory,

00:43:30.236 --> 00:43:36.207
personality trait that you would have liked to
work in for an NPC that never made it into the game?

00:43:36.957 --> 00:43:45.526
MATT: Oh, that's an interesting point. Who knows,
some elements might still come in, per se. Who to

00:43:45.526 --> 00:43:49.955
pick? It's interesting. You try to prepare as much
as you can as Dungeon Master, but the players

00:43:49.955 --> 00:43:57.058
always inevitably go <i>nowhere</i> you expect. You end
up having to throw half your stuff out the window.

00:43:57.058 --> 00:44:02.307
That's part of the fun of being Dungeon Master.
You go, "Okay, let's see where this goes." I've

00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:07.377
been really excited that through the Marquet
journey they've got to see a bit more of Gilmore's

00:44:07.377 --> 00:44:16.055
backstory, which is fun. Seen some more about
Allura's history and initial adventuring party a

00:44:16.055 --> 00:44:23.856
bit, the original battle with Thordak and stuff
like that. I would say there hasn't been enough

00:44:23.856 --> 00:44:34.817
time or interaction in Vasselheim, the Platinum
Sanctuary, and Highbearer Vord, and the history of

00:44:34.817 --> 00:44:41.895
how Kima came under his training, and their
relationship, which is of mutual respect, but also

00:44:41.895 --> 00:44:48.107
tenuous teacher and impetuous student. Even for as
many years as they've been working together, and

00:44:48.107 --> 00:44:52.709
as high ranked as Kima is within the order. We
never had the opportunity to really explore that

00:44:52.709 --> 00:44:56.857
too much and I don't know if we will, depending on
where the game goes. Maybe it will. We'll see.

00:44:56.857 --> 00:45:03.126
Kima's always been a personal favorite of mine.
It's a character archetype I never got a chance to

00:45:03.126 --> 00:45:07.587
roleplay too often, which was the "All right, you
guys are planning? You're taking too long. I'm

00:45:07.587 --> 00:45:16.449
kicking the door anyway." I love that. I love the
individual that, while wise and understands and

00:45:16.449 --> 00:45:22.286
never acts in a way that would endanger people and
is plotting well, but still gets impatient and

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:25.814
will push even their plot forward in a way that
will freak everyone else around them, but they

00:45:25.814 --> 00:45:29.795
won't tell anyone that, "I got it under control."
In the end when everything works okay and they're

00:45:29.795 --> 00:45:32.688
like, "What are you doing?!" They're like, "Oh. it
was fine I had a plan the whole time." Like, "Why

00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:39.817
didn't you say anything?" "Forgot." Kima works in
that realm a lot. We'll see, maybe one day.

00:45:39.817 --> 00:45:50.547
Awesome. All righty, we have a few more minutes.
We do have a panel, I believe, after this, right?

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:53.877
I think so, yeah. so we won't be able to stay
after. I'll try to get through a couple more

00:45:53.877 --> 00:45:56.766
questions as fast as possible and if we don't get
to your question, like I said, come to our other

00:45:56.766 --> 00:46:03.935
panel. Keep it in mind, and if you don't get to it
at MAGFest, maybe hit it on Twitter, or another convention.

00:46:03.935 --> 00:46:05.616
MARISHA: Or Talks Machina.

00:46:07.146 --> 00:46:08.064
BEN: Hi, I'm Ben.

00:46:08.064 --> 00:46:09.248
MATT and MARISHA: Hi, Ben!

00:46:09.248 --> 00:46:13.787
BEN: I'll make this quick. Thank you for your
amazing game, but also thank you for creating the

00:46:13.787 --> 00:46:23.656
community of people that has surrounded here. I
met so many amazing people through Twitter, so

00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:30.947
many of my now closest friends, because of you
guys, and I can only thank you so much for that. A

00:46:30.947 --> 00:46:38.007
little bit of backstory to my question: my Critter
game online is hitting one year next week, and I

00:46:38.007 --> 00:46:44.336
play an aarakocra sorcerer. My question to Matt
is: how have you, if you've even thought of it,

00:46:44.336 --> 00:46:49.788
implemented aarakocra into your world at all? Do
they have any roles specifically within either the

00:46:49.788 --> 00:46:54.536
Prime Material Plane or the Air Elemental Plane,
or anything like that? Or have you not even

00:46:54.536 --> 00:46:55.460
thought of it whatsoever?

00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:01.839
MATT: The campaign guide, as it comes to fruition
later this year, will have information about that.

00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:10.037
They're not well-known within most civilized areas
in Tal'Dorei, the continent proper. They do exist

00:47:10.037 --> 00:47:15.337
on the outskirts of society, and usually don't
interact on this continent too often with the

00:47:15.337 --> 00:47:20.905
fairer races, I guess you'd say. They're a little
more common on other continents, specifically

00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:26.755
Wildemount. That's as much as I can tell you.

00:47:26.755 --> 00:47:27.946
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!

00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:30.065
MATT: Good question.

00:47:32.745 --> 00:47:37.087
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, quick question. You mentioned
how the internet can be a mob of angry people with

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:44.758
pitchforks. My question would be, how do you find
the conviction to stay true to what you think your

00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:51.436
character would do and what your character's arc
would be, despite everybody being like, "They

00:47:51.436 --> 00:47:53.815
shouldn't do this," or "They shouldn't be in that
situation?"

00:47:55.485 --> 00:47:58.504
MARISHA: Much to their chagrin, I'm sure, I just
don't listen to them.

00:47:58.504 --> 00:48:05.239
(cheering)

00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:14.766
MARISHA: Don't get me wrong, I hear them. I feel
it, but their thoughts on how they think Keyleth

00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:23.326
should act or respond-- I appreciate that in their
realm and what they think that that's what fits

00:48:23.326 --> 00:48:28.946
into their headcanon, and that's fine, but I've
been with this character for almost five years

00:48:28.946 --> 00:48:37.707
now. Like we were talking about earlier, every
decision that we're encroached with, I'm like,

00:48:37.707 --> 00:48:47.636
"Well, I would do-- no. How would Keyleth act?
This is what she would do." There is thought

00:48:47.636 --> 00:48:54.056
behind all of our actions. Some of them are
impulsive, but even in that moment, we've been

00:48:54.056 --> 00:48:57.515
with these characters for so long, we know them
pretty well.

00:48:58.245 --> 00:49:04.985
MATT: To add onto that too, characters, realistic
characters, are complicated and full of

00:49:04.985 --> 00:49:06.990
contradictions and flaws.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.755
MARISHA: Not perfect.

00:49:09.025 --> 00:49:14.905
MATT: While a lot of media, you can pinpoint a few
similar traits that can explain a certain

00:49:14.905 --> 00:49:18.516
character, and that may be true most of the time,
but there will be exceptions. There'll be points

00:49:18.516 --> 00:49:25.590
of high duress. There'll be points of extreme
emotional pain. There will be moments of severe

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:33.055
fury or wish for vengeance that a character will
act out of their normal active zone. Those moments

00:49:33.055 --> 00:49:38.295
are wonderful and human, and places you can really
identify with, as many of us have been in those

00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:42.607
same places. On one might be like, "No, why is
that character doing this?! That doesn't make

00:49:42.607 --> 00:49:46.368
sense." How many times have you done some things
that didn't make sense and you may have regretted

00:49:46.368 --> 00:49:54.119
down the road? That's part of the process too. We
also understand that passion is passion. After

00:49:54.119 --> 00:50:05.616
every episode we get that barrage of, "Oh my god,
why?!" Our first response is like, "Because!" Then

00:50:05.616 --> 00:50:08.465
we all calm down the next day and we're like, "Eh,
it's all right."

00:50:08.465 --> 00:50:09.775
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:50:09.775 --> 00:50:10.912
MATT: No worries.

00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:18.036
MARISHA: Maybe time for one or two more?

00:50:18.036 --> 00:50:23.799
MATT: One or two quick ones because we don't want
to hold up the rest of the evening. Two more quick

00:50:23.799 --> 00:50:26.395
questions. Those we didn't get to, we're so sorry,
we have another panel. Please bring it with you

00:50:26.395 --> 00:50:26.966
next time.

00:50:26.966 --> 00:50:27.407
MARISHA: Yes!

00:50:27.407 --> 00:50:28.692
MATT: Question?

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:40.169
JAMES: Hello. James Klaus, wizard <i>on</i> the coast.
I had actually a very pragmatic question for you,

00:50:40.169 --> 00:50:44.125
Matt. How do you price out Laura's bear armor?

00:50:44.885 --> 00:50:51.256
MATT: Oh, how do you price out Laura's bear
armor? I'd have to go back to my notes. A lot of

00:50:51.256 --> 00:50:57.357
it is spur of the moment, trying to figure it out
based on, well, the time of an actual suit of

00:50:57.357 --> 00:51:01.448
armor and then barding for a creature, and then
custom barding for what is a non-common creature

00:51:01.448 --> 00:51:04.547
to have armor constructed for it would be like
double or triple the cost, and then you consider

00:51:04.547 --> 00:51:09.786
the materials involved are rare materials, and the
quality of how they were harvested. So for that--

00:51:09.786 --> 00:51:11.118
JAMES: Who's going to do it?

00:51:11.118 --> 00:51:13.955
MATT: Yeah, to find somebody who's actually
comfortable doing this and rolling for them to see

00:51:13.955 --> 00:51:16.836
if they don't end up ruining the materials, and
then like, well, here's half your money back and

00:51:16.836 --> 00:51:20.393
you don't get anything. It can be that complicated
if you want to, or you can just say, "Uh, it's

00:51:20.393 --> 00:51:27.347
5,000. Here's your armor." Depends on how you want
to run your game. I run in the middle of not too

00:51:27.347 --> 00:51:32.675
overcomplicated and a little bit of just keeping
the narrative flowing. But a lot of those moments

00:51:32.675 --> 00:51:36.384
like that, I didn't know she was going to try and
do custom bulette armor for Trinket, so I went,

00:51:36.384 --> 00:51:43.336
"Sure! It'll cost this much and you have to find
this person." Make notes later to write down how

00:51:43.336 --> 00:51:48.464
much the bulette armor was. You know. So, off the
top of my head, I have no idea, but I'm sure

00:51:48.464 --> 00:51:50.625
CritRoleStats would be happy to let you know.

00:51:50.625 --> 00:51:55.468
(laughter)

00:51:55.468 --> 00:51:58.980
JAMES: The other thing is, after last night's
episode, I thought that maybe you guys could use

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.831
some chocolate, so I bought some chocolate.

00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:03.386
MATT: Oh, what?! That's awesome, thank you,
buddy.

00:52:03.386 --> 00:52:04.762
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:52:04.762 --> 00:52:06.585
MATT: And you, for the final question of the
evening, <i>monsieur</i>.

00:52:07.225 --> 00:52:12.549
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Welcome. Good to have you back,
Matt. Marisha, welcome to the venue. First off,

00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:16.170
thank you guys for both the entertainment and the
inspiration. Matt, your DMing mastery has inspired

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:20.277
me to start working on my own homebrew campaign in
the Witcher universe.

00:52:20.277 --> 00:52:21.356
MATT: Oh, yes!

00:52:21.356 --> 00:52:26.325
MARISHA: Can I just say, real quick, it sounds
like we're all going down on the Titanic for this

00:52:26.325 --> 00:52:32.701
last question. So I just want to relish this
moment. Proceed, Green Arrow. Proceed.

00:52:33.941 --> 00:52:38.450
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Indeed. So this is more of a
pre-stream question. Having gone through the first

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:45.199
campaign with people like CrossFit, which blows
people's minds, has there ever been an instance

00:52:45.199 --> 00:52:49.016
when the Crit Role campaign really started that
felt like it was going to come off the rails and

00:52:49.016 --> 00:52:50.189
just not work.

00:52:52.229 --> 00:52:57.076
MARISHA: Like, when we started streaming? Oh,
before stream.

00:52:59.216 --> 00:53:06.864
MATT: It's hard to do that when-- well, I've been
gaming for a long time, and it comes with

00:53:06.864 --> 00:53:12.408
experience to learn how to bullshit your way to
get things back on the rails. It may be by the

00:53:12.408 --> 00:53:16.312
seat of your pants, but as long as your players
are having a good time, it's better to let them

00:53:16.312 --> 00:53:19.307
guide that to that point. So even if it's
completely away from your story and you're like,

00:53:19.307 --> 00:53:24.377
"All right, I wrote three hours of story that
we're never going to see, that's fine." If the

00:53:24.377 --> 00:53:29.267
players are having a good time, you just let them
roll and see where the story finds itself at that

00:53:29.267 --> 00:53:32.567
point. If you can find a way to connect it back,
try to. If not, finish the session, "Thanks, guys,

00:53:32.567 --> 00:53:35.984
that was great," and then spend the next week
going, "Oh shit, how do I bring this back?!"

00:53:35.984 --> 00:53:41.386
Downtime as DM between sessions is huge to try and
tie those threads back together, but you don't

00:53:41.386 --> 00:53:45.007
want to feel like you're pushing the players back
because they went too far beyond the boundary,

00:53:45.007 --> 00:53:49.476
because I think that goes against the-- The nature
of what makes D&amp;D so special is the fact that you

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:53.465
can essentially push in any direction and not find
an invisible barrier and run off the corner like a

00:53:53.465 --> 00:53:58.554
bad Resident Evil character. So yeah. I don't
think there was ever a point where I felt like it

00:53:58.554 --> 00:54:01.667
wasn't going to work. There were definitely many
points where I was like, "I have no idea what's

00:54:01.667 --> 00:54:06.797
going to happen," and the session ends, and I'm
like, "All right, I got homework! Good game, guys,

00:54:06.797 --> 00:54:07.456
good game."

00:54:07.456 --> 00:54:12.955
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Another chocolate-related
question: my mom's also from Kentucky, and I took

00:54:12.965 --> 00:54:13.956
up the tradition of making bourbon balls.

00:54:13.956 --> 00:54:18.218
MARISHA: Uhh.

00:54:18.218 --> 00:54:21.086
MATT: We do have a signing tomorrow. I don't think
she'll say no to that, you are doing the lord's work.

00:54:26.698 --> 00:54:27.798
MATT: That is fantastic.

00:54:27.938 --> 00:54:32.505
MARISHA: (chocolate-anticipatory gibberish)

00:54:33.685 --> 00:54:36.735
MATT: Guys, thank you all so much for coming to
our Critical Role panel.

00:54:36.735 --> 00:54:50.537
(cheering)

00:54:50.537 --> 00:54:53.237
MATT: We're not worthy! Never enough time for all
the questions, but like I said, please bring them

00:54:53.237 --> 00:54:55.595
to other panels. We'll be happy to answer them,
and to the confusion of everybody else in the

00:54:55.595 --> 00:54:59.730
panel room, that's even better. But anyway, have a
wonderful night, drink well, game well, enjoy, and

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.187
we'll see you guys throughout the weekend!

00:55:01.187 --> 00:55:04.446
(cheering)

00:55:04.446 --> 00:55:35.617
