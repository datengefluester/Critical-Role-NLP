NOTE Paragraph

00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:29.007
INTERVIEWER: Welcome to Puerto Rico!

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:30.214
LAURA: Hi!

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:33.958
INTERVIEWER: Can I call you Laura or do I call you
Miss Bailey?

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.046
LAURA: You can call me Laura.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:37.311
TRAVIS: Miss Bailey.

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:39.499
LAURA: Miss Bailey, please.

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:42.735
INTERVIEWER: Are you guys happy to have them
here?

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:46.435
(cheering)

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:49.495
LAURA: Yay, I'm going to hold this.

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:51.347
TRAVIS: I'm going to leave mine on the stand.

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:54.685
LAURA: I like sitting back. It's a casual sort of
environment.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:01:01.593
INTERVIEWER: We're going to do this. We're going
to start with us asking some questions, but when

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:09.227
you guys are interested-- at around the 25 minute
mark-- you start doing the line, and you

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:10.835
will get your chance.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:11.964
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Wherever?

00:01:11.964 --> 00:01:14.433
INTERVIEWER: You can ask the staff.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.199
LAURA: You are going to be standing there a while
though.

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:20.001
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I don't care!

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.165
INTERVIEWER: They do love you.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.706
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You are worth it.

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:27.638
LAURA: Yass, yass queen!

00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:32.538
INTERVIEWER: As you can see, we Puerto Ricans
don't hide what we think of you.

00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:35.070
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Binary Domain.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.642
TRAVIS: We are going to make out.

00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:38.073
LAURA: Oh! This is our make out scene?

00:01:38.073 --> 00:01:40.408
(laughter)

00:01:40.408 --> 00:01:41.676
LAURA: Oh shoot!

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.262
TRAVIS: Patching you up. I'm patching up your
arm.

00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:46.581
LAURA: Oh yeah, oh Dan, thank you so much!

00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:49.598
INTERVIEWER: I believe you have an accent there,
you did that accent really well.

00:01:49.598 --> 00:01:51.716
LAURA: I know. I did. I was Chinese in this game.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.364
(laughter)

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:59.004
INTERVIEWER: How did you two start in this
business?

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.235
LAURA and TRAVIS: Well--

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:10.729
LAURA: I started fresh out of high school. I was
doing a play, in the local Dallas theater

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.942
community, and one of the people that was in the
show with me also did voices for Dragon Ball Z. He

00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:24.616
asked if I was interested in auditioning for
anything because he knew that there were some

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:31.095
characters coming up, and I was like: Yes please!
So he had me call Chris Sabat who's the voice of

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:32.395
Vegeta, Piccolo.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:34.970
(cheering)

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.007
LAURA: I went in, I auditioned and I ended up--
I originally actually got cast as Dende, a voice

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:46.474
match for Dende. I went in and recorded and I was
so nervous and then about three weeks went by and

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:50.092
I didn't hear anything and I was like; I think I
was supposed to go back in to record some more.

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:56.956
Then Chris Sabat calls me he's like: Hey Laura,
this isn't actually my job, but I feel like I need

00:02:56.956 --> 00:03:02.665
to tell you that the woman who originally played
Dende came back in town and so we replaced all

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:06.385
your stuff. I was like: oh no! He's like, but we
really like you and we're going to bring you back

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:09.848
in. I went back in and I was Trunks and that's how
that happened.

00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:13.298
(cheering)

00:03:13.298 --> 00:03:19.488
TRAVIS: My story is kind of attached to Laura's. I
loved Dragon Ball Z when I was in college. I

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:24.961
watched it all the time with my friends. One day
we watched until the credits started rolling and I

00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:31.179
saw Laura's name go over the screen. I was like:
what the what! I know her! Because we had the same

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:35.872
agency in Dallas at the time so I called my agent
and was like: Why is Laura in this show that I love?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.407
(laughter)

00:03:37.407 --> 00:03:41.440
TRAVIS: She was like, "Oh yeah she works at
Funimation. It's in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,"

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.971
which is like 40 minutes from where I was going to
school. I was like, "Oh my God." So I called Laura

00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.925
and she picks up the phone--

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:50.196
LAURA: I've never gotten a phone call from Travis
before

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:55.449
TRAVIS: I've never talked to her before. And she
was like, "Hello?" And I was like, "[inaudible mumbling]"

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.633
LAURA: Who is this?

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:01.033
TRAVIS: I was like, "Please! Help me get an
audition at Funimation, I want to be in Dragon Ball Z."

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:04.369
LAURA: Oh, sure, I'll be sure to do that. I'm
going to let them know.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:10.200
TRAVIS: Three years later, I still had not gotten
a message.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.719
LAURA: I'm terrible. I'm right on top of that,
bro.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:17.877
TRAVIS: For shame! Then I did an independent film
with Mike McFarland who was a director of

00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:25.729
Fullmetal Alchemist. He let me come in to an
audition for a character named Roy Mustang, and

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.549
that was how everything started.

00:04:27.549 --> 00:04:29.064
(cheering)

00:04:29.064 --> 00:04:32.990
LAURA: Wait, when did you do Yu Yu Hakusho?
Was that before or after?

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.914
TRAVIS: It was during that.

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:35.251
LAURA: Okay.

00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:39.914
INTERVIEWER: We just played a clip of you as Roy
Mustang and her as Lust. It's epic.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:41.434
TRAVIS: How did that work out for you, Laura?

00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:43.050
(laughter)

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.746
LAURA: It depends on which scene we are talking
about. Oh how about this one! How did this one

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:50.556
work out for you, Travis?

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:55.477
TRAVIS: It's fine! I'm going to get the upper hand
here in one second. Watch him!

00:04:55.477 --> 00:04:59.828
Oh no! Not the face! (yelling)

00:04:59.828 --> 00:05:01.146
LAURA: Spoilers.

00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:03.299
TRAVIS: Everything's okay!

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:06.533
LAURA: Spoilers, Fetch wins.

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:08.330
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's theâ€“ Yeah.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.268
(Dismayed yelling)

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.384
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:05:11.384 --> 00:05:12.871
LAURA: Death to Shane.

00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.601
TRAVIS: He's okay. It's like Harry Potter. He just
disapparated.

00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:18.546
(laughter)

00:05:18.748 --> 00:05:20.529
LAURA: That's right.

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:27.971
INTERVIEWER: You two do voice acting, you do
motion capture, you sing, you have a beautiful

00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:36.302
voice. I know he does Iive action, because the
first time I saw him, was as Big Jane in Nip/Tuck.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.622
LAURA: Oh! (laughter)

00:05:37.622 --> 00:05:38.807
TRAVIS: Yep. That happened.

00:05:38.807 --> 00:05:39.855
INTERVIEWER: He was awesome at it.

00:05:39.855 --> 00:05:40.836
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Anarchist cookbook!

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:42.605
LAURA: Wow.

00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:44.043
TRAVIS: Anarchist cookbook! That's right! I went
back in the day. Yeah.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:44.762
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Critical Role!

00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:46.010
LAURA: Critical Role!

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.247
(cheering)

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.409
TRAVIS: Yeah. We both have a D&amp;D show called
Critical Role where a bunch of crazy nerdy voice

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.349
actors play Dungeons &amp; Dragons every Thursday
night on our Twitch channel. It's amazing. If

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:02.666
you've never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons and you
think it's some nerdy thing and you're not interested--

00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:03.483
LAURA: You're correct.

00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:04.839
(laughter)

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:11.685
TRAVIS: Yeah. I promise you, you're correct and
you're wrong, because it's so great. So much fun.

00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:17.691
(as Grog) Yes, Grog the Barbarian welcomes you to
Critical Role.

00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:18.670
(laughter and applause)

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:25.561
INTERVIEWER: In all of these things, what is your
creative process? Do you do something different

00:06:25.561 --> 00:06:29.594
for each character? Or do you have a set of rules
that you follow--

00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:34.184
LAURA: Oh, every character is completely
different. I mean obviously it depends on what

00:06:34.184 --> 00:06:39.837
we're doing. If we're doing motion capture, it's
like you're filming a movie. You're in there and

00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:47.755
you'll record for months to a year filming that
character. Then with VO, you go in once every

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:54.031
couple months and be working on something.
Something like Persona I only got to record two

00:06:54.031 --> 00:06:59.076
four-hour sessions and then I was done with the
whole game and so it ends up being this amazing

00:06:59.076 --> 00:07:03.059
thing, but at the time, you don't know it, because
you're just seeing this little tiny portion of it.

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:08.316
TRAVIS: Yeah, there are times where we don't even
get to play the games or see anything from the

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:10.028
games until months and months later.

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:10.513
LAURA: Yeah.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.416
TRAVIS: We don't entirely know what the entire
story is, sometimes we don't even know what the

00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:21.872
characters look like, so it's really an exercise
in using your imagination and playing pretend.

00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:28.056
LAURA: Yeah. And then you do something like
InFAMOUS where we got to go up to Seattle and talk

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:33.325
to the team who was actually developing the game
and talk about our characters early on, so

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:37.744
you really get to identify with the story the
entire way through.

00:07:37.744 --> 00:07:38.655
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:07:38.655 --> 00:07:39.846
LAURA: I mean, it was our faces.

00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:41.226
TRAVIS: It was our faces.

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:42.248
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, Catherine!

00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:47.650
LAURA: Catherine! This is one of those things
where I had no idea what I was getting into.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.221
(laughter)

00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:55.234
LAURA: I had gone to four recording sessions by
the time I even realized what Catherine was. I was

00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:59.557
like, "What?! What is happening in this game right
now!"

00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:02.338
TRAVIS: We tried to play the game and it was
hard.

00:08:02.338 --> 00:08:03.880
LAURA: Yeah, right.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:13.091
INTERVIEWER: If you could have any other
profession, what would it be?

00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.741
LAURA: Oh, man. What would you be Travis?

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.857
TRAVIS: I would be a horse.

00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:23.660
(laughter)

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:30.029
TRAVIS: I would run free through the fields! I
would be a unicorn! What would you be?

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:31.480
LAURA: That's a good job, Travis.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.594
TRAVIS: Yep it would be. I would be magical.

00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:37.182
LAURA: It is really hard though to think of any
other career!

00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:37.868
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:45.136
LAURA: I mean, I've been doing this since I was in
high school, so it's hard to imagine.

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:47.136
TRAVIS: I'd be a wrestler.

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:49.202
LAURA: That's what you'd be. Yeah definitely.

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:49.839
(laughter)

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:54.036
LAURA: I would probably, I don't know, do
something with animals or biology.

00:08:54.036 --> 00:08:55.870
TRAVIS: (snoring)

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.518
(laughter)

00:08:57.518 --> 00:09:00.835
LAURA: I know. I mean, I would be a bear, and I
would roam the forests.

00:09:00.835 --> 00:09:01.627
(applause)

00:09:01.627 --> 00:09:02.634
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Trinket!

00:09:02.634 --> 00:09:05.212
LAURA: I would be Trinket, that's right.

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.597
TRAVIS: You would do something with animals. You
like animals more than people sometimes.

00:09:07.597 --> 00:09:12.934
LAURA: I do. If I go to a party, I find the dog at
the party, and I sit, and I pet the dog.

00:09:12.934 --> 00:09:14.723
TRAVIS: Yep. It's true.

00:09:14.723 --> 00:09:15.916
INTERVIEWER: That's going to be on your profile
now.

00:09:15.916 --> 00:09:16.952
LAURA: (laughing) Yeah, exactly!

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:20.205
LAURA: I can talk to you easier than I can talk to
other people.

00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:23.474
TRAVIS: If our house was on fire, she would
probably grab the dog instead of me.

00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:25.072
(laughter)

00:09:25.072 --> 00:09:28.375
LAURA: Because you have a brain and can get out of
the house.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:29.909
TRAVIS: Ah, that's true.

00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:35.627
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, Charlie has a brain too, but
he wouldn't know! And he's so close to the ground

00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:38.160
he wouldn't be able to see where to go, man!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.408
(laughter)

00:09:39.408 --> 00:09:41.596
LAURA: I just love him so much!

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:42.733
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What breed is he?

00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:45.044
LAURA: He's a miniature dachshund.

00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:46.320
(yelling)

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.938
LAURA: I know, I know! But he's a long-haired
dachshund, so he's super fluffy cute.

00:09:51.938 --> 00:09:53.072
TRAVIS: He's like a Swiffer.

00:09:53.072 --> 00:09:54.520
(laughter)

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.503
LAURA: Yeah.

00:09:55.503 --> 00:09:56.616
TRAVIS: He picks up everything on the floor.

00:09:56.616 --> 00:10:00.557
LAURA: His tail is so long and fuzzy and like
(sweeping noises). When you take him on a walk it's

00:10:00.557 --> 00:10:03.408
a big bunch of leaves trailing behind him all the
time.

00:10:03.408 --> 00:10:04.694
TRAVIS: All the shit in his tail.

00:10:04.694 --> 00:10:06.695
LAURA: Yeah. He's so cute.

00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:07.820
AUDIENCE: A fluffy Roomba!

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.344
INTERVIEWER: Out of all the work you've done
what's your favorite role so far and why?

00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:14.798
LAURA: Oh, that's hard.

00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:19.595
TRAVIS: That's impossible, that's like trying to
pick between your kids, man. Can't do that. It's tough--

00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:21.734
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Everybody knows there's a
favorite.

00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:22.713
(laughter)

00:10:22.713 --> 00:10:25.253
LAURA: Exactly. You all at the same time say what
your favorite character is.

00:10:25.253 --> 00:10:26.751
TRAVIS: One, two, three. Go!

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.800
[inaudible]

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.352
LAURA: Mustang, I heard so many "Mustang"s.

00:10:30.352 --> 00:10:31.692
AUDIENCE: (yelling)

00:10:31.692 --> 00:10:34.936
LAURA: Jacob!

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:36.321
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Shin-Chan!

00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:37.950
LAURA: (as Shin-Chan) "Ooh, I like it! Thank you."

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.558
TRAVIS: Ooh?

00:10:39.558 --> 00:10:42.425
LAURA: Ooh, Shin, okay.

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:47.660
INTERVIEWER: Is there a character played by
another actor that you wish you would have played?

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.698
LAURA: I mean, that's hard. Obviously there's
projects that I loved so much that it would have

00:10:53.698 --> 00:10:55.869
been amazing to be a part of, like Mass Effect--

00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:57.264
(cheering)

00:10:57.264 --> 00:11:04.134
I mean, come on! Commander Shepard is amazing!
But! I feel like I learned so much about voice

00:11:04.134 --> 00:11:08.727
acting from playing that game, Like learning from
Jennifer Hale and hearing what she did with the

00:11:08.727 --> 00:11:15.695
role and I can't imagine anybody but her being
Commander Shepard she was just so good. So while,

00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:21.829
yes, I would have loved to play that part, in no
way would I want to play that game without Jen as voice.

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:22.825
INTERVIEWER: She's amazing.

00:11:22.825 --> 00:11:24.143
LAURA: She's fucking phenomenal.

00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:25.543
TRAVIS: I wish I could have been--

00:11:25.543 --> 00:11:27.198
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She's going to Star Con this
year!

00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:30.766
LAURA: Heck yeah, man! Tell her I said hi when she
comes.

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:33.015
TRAVIS: I would have liked to have been Sailor
Moon.

00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:35.549
(laughter and cheering)

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:37.234
TRAVIS: Or maybe Bubbles from the Powerpuff
Girls.

00:11:37.234 --> 00:11:39.582
LAURA: I'm glad you take these questions so
seriously, Travis.

00:11:39.582 --> 00:11:41.587
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do your best Bubbles impression!

00:11:41.587 --> 00:11:42.742
TRAVIS: (high pitched) "Bubbles!"

00:11:42.742 --> 00:11:44.404
(applause)

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.590
LAURA: You could have, you could have totally done
that--

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.572
TRAVIS: "Honey Pop!"

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:50.607
LAURA: Nailed it.

00:11:50.607 --> 00:11:52.425
TRAVIS: Nailed it.

00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:54.996
INTERVIEWER: If you could create your dream role,
what would it be?

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:57.762
TRAVIS: Oh man.

00:11:57.762 --> 00:12:02.317
LAURA: Again, I want a video game that takes place
during the Regency so I can play something out of

00:12:02.317 --> 00:12:09.450
Pride and Prejudice but in a video game. And I
want to film it in mocap and in mocap I have to

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.683
wear one of those dresses.

00:12:11.683 --> 00:12:18.649
TRAVIS: I want to do a kamehameha in some game.
But not Dragon Ball Z, something else. Just once.

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:25.275
LAURA: Actually, if we could do like a Critical
Role video game or Critical Role animated project

00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:27.143
that would be pretty freaking cool.

00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:28.063
(cheering)

00:12:28.063 --> 00:12:28.908
TRAVIS: That would be pretty sweet.

00:12:28.908 --> 00:12:30.025
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I would pay all the money!

00:12:30.025 --> 00:12:30.880
TRAVIS: All of the money.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.045
LAURA: That'd be pretty awesome.

00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:39.000
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, that would be awesome. Hardcore
fans know that you guys have been married since 2011.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.481
(cheering)

00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:42.765
INTERVIEWER: Congratulations!

00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:51.421
LAURA: Don't shake your head at me! Showing off my
beautiful ring!

00:12:51.421 --> 00:12:57.208
INTERVIEWER: How did that come to be? Was it love
at first sight? Though I guess it wasn't because you--

00:12:57.208 --> 00:13:03.659
LAURA: (laughs) Well, yes you know how we met.
"(muffled) Who is this?"

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:07.379
TRAVIS: Yeah! "Will you marry me and put me in
Dragon Ball Z?"

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:09.379
INTERVIEWER: Was it love in the voice booth?

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:11.491
LAURA: No, we were--

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:12.769
TRAVIS: We knew each other for a long time.

00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:15.002
LAURA: Yeah we've been friends since we were 18.

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:16.215
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:13:16.215 --> 00:13:16.933
AUDIENCE: Wow!

00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:21.007
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'd worked together for a long
time, we knew each other when she was in Texas and

00:13:21.007 --> 00:13:25.737
I was in California and she moved out to
California and then it was sparks baby, sparks!

00:13:25.737 --> 00:13:27.334
(laughter)

00:13:27.334 --> 00:13:29.976
LAURA: Yeah we started dating right after i moved
out to California, so.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.206
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:13:31.206 --> 00:13:38.076
INTERVIEWER: That's sweet. If you could choose
between emotional scenes or action scenes which do

00:13:38.076 --> 00:13:39.694
you prefer to do?

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:45.129
TRAVIS: It depends on the project. Sometimes there
are projects that have very emotional scenes but

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:49.930
sometimes it feels a little strange in that
project. Others you're like, "Oh this is really

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:55.398
good, this is some meaty stuff I can sink my teeth
into." Other times you just want to fight. You

00:13:55.398 --> 00:14:02.404
want to be cool and have the scene be really
exciting. So it depends on what the show is.

00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:09.354
LAURA: If it's just a video game I will prefer to
do something with more story in a video game as

00:14:09.354 --> 00:14:13.501
opposed to a straight up fighting game for the
recording process because usually in a fighting

00:14:13.501 --> 00:14:20.480
game you don't really get to do very much other
than scream. Which can be kind of painful, to

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.753
scream for four hours straight. But those are
crazy fun to play.

00:14:26.753 --> 00:14:30.114
INTERVIEWER: Although, Nadine does pose--

00:14:30.114 --> 00:14:35.567
LAURA: Nadine is so freaking cool. But that was
mocap I mean we went in and filmed that, yeah--

00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:45.491
Oh, is she? Oh hello. We filmed that. Filming all
those scenes is-- and working with Richard

00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:54.311
McGonagall-- he's so good! He's so good and he's
so charming. I loved talking to him so much. Yeah.

00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:56.733
That was a great project.

00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:58.993
INTERVIEWER: It is. I'm still--

00:14:58.993 --> 00:15:00.145
LAURA: Still working on it?

00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:04.800
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, because of this I haven't
been-- but I'm going to finish it at some point.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.969
LAURA: Oh no!

00:15:05.969 --> 00:15:08.384
INTERVIEWER: Are you guys ready to ask some
questions?

00:15:08.384 --> 00:15:09.771
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:11.122
INTERVIEWER: Let's start!

00:15:11.122 --> 00:15:13.037
TRAVIS: Yaass queen.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:20.511
LAURA: Yaasss! Oh my god! I feel
like--

00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:21.820
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I think the mic's off.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.310
LAURA: Oh, are you guys talking? Oh there it is.
Oh hi!

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:33.046
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've got one question for each.
First, for Laura. We all know you're Kid Trunks

00:15:33.046 --> 00:15:42.266
from Dragon Ball Z. How did it feel working with Sean
Schemmel and Christopher Sabat, these big voice actors?

00:15:42.266 --> 00:15:48.457
LAURA: (as Kid Trunks) Well, I mean, it was really
awesome working with my dad, but it was kind of

00:15:48.457 --> 00:15:54.631
lame working with that dork Goku because, I mean,
he's not as cool as everyone thinks he is.

00:15:54.631 --> 00:16:00.811
I mean, he kind of smells bad, I mean,
and he always has food in his teeth.

00:16:00.811 --> 00:16:07.094
But my dad, he's like really really cool he takes
me to the park when I ask and he can beat anybody

00:16:07.094 --> 00:16:09.980
up. I mean, it's pretty awesome.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:18.985
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh my god. (laughter) For Travis:
we love you as Roy Mustang, but if you could be

00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:22.771
anyone else from Fullmetal Alchemist besides Roy
Mustang--

00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:23.975
LAURA: Lust.

00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:34.575
TRAVIS: (as Lust) Yes, I've got my eye you. I'm
Lust. I'm a homunculus. You're going to die.

00:16:34.575 --> 00:16:37.731
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Speaking of Fullmetal
Alchemist--

00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:45.731
LAURA: Oh! There it is! Must-- Oh, there you,
(yelling)!

00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:48.799
TRAVIS: Snippity snap snip pah pow!

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:51.738
INTERVIEWER: We were talking about screaming
earlier! Those screams are epic!

00:16:51.738 --> 00:16:57.353
LAURA: Those screams were painful! (laughter) Mike
McFarland did not make me do that too many times.

00:16:57.353 --> 00:17:00.587
TRAVIS: (singing) "Smores, I'm making 'smores"

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:03.042
LAURA: Aww!

00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:05.757
TRAVIS: And, hold it right there.

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:08.478
LAURA: I've got to admit, Mustang was pretty
freaking cool in that scene.

00:17:08.478 --> 00:17:10.384
TRAVIS: Boosh!

00:17:10.384 --> 00:17:16.062
LAURA: Oh, so badass!

00:17:16.062 --> 00:17:17.575
TRAVIS and LAURA: Ever!

00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:19.329
TRAVIS: Thank you man.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:19.995
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello!

00:17:19.995 --> 00:17:22.115
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Hello!

00:17:22.115 --> 00:17:25.901
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's my first time meeting you
and Laura, I want to say, your role in

00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:29.070
Resident Evil 6, Helena, the best role
I've ever heard--

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.991
LAURA: Thank you!

00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:31.684
AUDIENCE MEMBER: --I love the way you played those
scenes, you were kickass.

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:34.905
LAURA: Thank you. That was amazing to get to work
on. Yeah, thank you.

00:17:34.905 --> 00:17:44.309
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is for both of you,
and it's this. If you woke up in the morning and

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:50.582
you were stuck in an anime or game world, which
anime or game world would you love to be stuck in?

00:17:50.582 --> 00:17:52.895
AUDIENCE: Oh boy!

00:17:52.895 --> 00:17:54.178
LAURA: Oh jeez!

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:55.333
AUDIENCE: No pressure!

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:57.770
TRAVIS: Actually, somebody asked me something like
this once, and I was like oh I would be in the

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.579
Marvel world, except there would be--

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:00.934
LAURA: Dude, that would suck though!

00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:02.650
TRAVIS: Yeah, everything would be getting crashed
all the time.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:03.685
LAURA: All the time!

00:18:03.685 --> 00:18:04.934
TRAVIS: If you lived in New York, and you were--

00:18:04.934 --> 00:18:06.251
LAURA: And you were just a regular civilian!

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.252
TRAVIS and LAURA: Life sucks!

00:18:08.252 --> 00:18:10.633
TRAVIS: They had giant whales from outer 
space crashing through the buildings, and Thor

00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:15.245
is lighting everything up with lightning, Hulk is
smashing everything--

00:18:15.249 --> 00:18:16.142
LAURA: Yeah, no--

00:18:16.142 --> 00:18:17.193
TRAVIS: No thank you.

00:18:17.193 --> 00:18:19.359
LAURA: I would choose Fruits Basket. (laughter)

00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:21.359
TRAVIS: Really?

00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:23.663
LAURA: Yeah! Because it's pretty normal only--

00:18:23.663 --> 00:18:24.557
TRAVIS: Really?

00:18:24.557 --> 00:18:26.629
LAURA: --people turn into animals. That's cool!

00:18:26.629 --> 00:18:34.283
TRAVIS: I-- maybe like Adventure Time.
That'd be pretty fun.

00:18:34.283 --> 00:18:36.002
LAURA: That would be pretty awesome, okay.

00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:36.683
TRAVIS: Or Rick and Morty.

00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:38.704
LAURA: Rick and Morty!

00:18:38.704 --> 00:18:41.582
TRAVIS: Yeah, Rick and Morty.

00:18:41.582 --> 00:18:42.741
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, thank you.

00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:43.471
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:44.837
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:18:44.837 --> 00:18:46.294
LAURA: Hello.

00:18:46.294 --> 00:18:51.976
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Long time fan, very much not into
the community because I never realized that

00:18:51.976 --> 00:18:55.146
Travis, you are literally my childhood.
(laughter)

00:18:55.146 --> 00:18:57.784
TRAVIS: (deep voice) You're welcome.

00:18:57.784 --> 00:19:01.315
AUDIENCE: Travis is my teenage years? (laughter)
And Laura too!

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:02.046
LAURA: Woo!

00:19:02.046 --> 00:19:04.902
TRAVIS: But I'm your whole life!

00:19:04.902 --> 00:19:07.562
LAURA: I feel old.

00:19:07.562 --> 00:19:11.772
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, any self-respecting fan of
the both of you should know that you, Travis, were

00:19:11.772 --> 00:19:14.770
gifted a paddle. A very specific paddle.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.036
AUDIENCE: Oh god.

00:19:16.036 --> 00:19:23.243
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If anybody is unfamiliar with the
term, look it up. And I want to ask you, is Laura

00:19:23.243 --> 00:19:26.238
a good mini skirt or a bad mini skirt?

00:19:26.238 --> 00:19:29.175
AUDIENCE: (gasping)

00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:32.557
TRAVIS: I like how half the room over there went
"Oh my god!"

00:19:32.557 --> 00:19:34.799
LAURA: That is really graphic, okay?

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:40.934
TRAVIS: There is, like, the harem of mini skirts,
and then there is my wife. And there is

00:19:40.934 --> 00:19:43.350
no paddle for my wife.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.870
LAURA: No no. No no.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.099
TRAVIS: (mimicking) Darn.

00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:50.799
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Welcome to Puerto Rico.

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.535
LAURA and TRAVIS: Thank you!

00:19:52.535 --> 00:19:57.040
AUDIENCE MEMBER: From all your roles, which one
was the hardest to play for you?

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.177
LAURA: You go first.

00:20:00.177 --> 00:20:06.375
TRAVIS: There are roles that are very vocally
stressful, there are a lot of-- Some voices are

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:09.823
easy for us to do for long hours, hour hour hour
hour--

00:20:09.823 --> 00:20:11.409
LAURA: Hour hour hour hour

00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:15.797
TRAVIS: Hour hour hour. Because it's usually
within our normal vocal range. Even Trunks-- for

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:19.682
Laura-- can be super hard because (Trunks voice )
you have to drop your voice down and do this and

00:20:19.682 --> 00:20:24.831
it's really gravelly. (normal voice) If there's a
part that, you know, has to go from here and then

00:20:24.831 --> 00:20:28.771
drops down (deep voice) deeper and then all of a
sudden (as Grog) you have to do, like, a horrible

00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:30.973
accent on it and then maybe he's got a--

00:20:30.973 --> 00:20:31.844
LAURA: Grog?

00:20:31.844 --> 00:20:36.624
TRAVIS: --he's got really big teeth and then all
of a sudden, like, it's all messy like this,

00:20:36.624 --> 00:20:42.661
right? (normal voice) It's kinda hard, so really
vocally stressful voices are pretty tough to do

00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:44.374
for long amounts of time.

00:20:44.374 --> 00:20:45.144
LAURA: Yeah.

00:20:45.144 --> 00:20:46.527
TRAVIS: Those can be tough.

00:20:46.527 --> 00:20:53.531
LAURA: Yeah, like Omochao in Sonic? Yeah,
which is so well loved by everyone, I know,

00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:56.052
Yeah, I know, right?

00:20:56.052 --> 00:20:58.221
AUDIENCE: Actually, I ended up liking her because
you were voicing her!

00:20:58.221 --> 00:21:04.500
LAURA: Aww, thanks! I think he's a boy though.
Yeah, it was super duper painful.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.272
I remember auditioning for it and I almost
sprained my vocal cords just doing the audition

00:21:09.272 --> 00:21:13.805
for it. Because it was (as Omochao) super duper
high! Like this all the time! And I think my face

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:18.823
turns bright red as I'm doing it. (normal voice)
And I was like "Dear God don't let me get this

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:24.215
role" and then I booked it. And it was like four
hours at a time doing that voice and my director

00:21:24.215 --> 00:21:30.151
actually had to re-teach meâ€“ and this is after
I'd been voice acting for, you know, 12 yearsâ€“

00:21:30.151 --> 00:21:35.702
teach me how to stand in the booth in order to get
that kind of a voice to happen and maintain it for

00:21:35.702 --> 00:21:42.204
that long. Because I'd gotten so used to my own
postures and my own way of doing things, and for

00:21:42.204 --> 00:21:46.079
something like that you really have to be
technical with it in order to sustain.

00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:48.175
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah.

00:21:48.175 --> 00:21:51.009
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:54.504
INTERVIEWER: Has there been any role that's
emotionally draining?

00:21:54.504 --> 00:21:55.877
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:55.877 --> 00:22:01.232
TRAVIS: Yeah. A lot of them are. But that's the
nice thing about acting is that you are engaged in

00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:04.180
it in the day and then you go home and let it go.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.936
LAURA: Do you though? I mean, that's why it's so
hard.

00:22:06.936 --> 00:22:08.005
TRAVIS: If you're sane!

00:22:08.005 --> 00:22:11.008
LAURA: I mean, yeah. It's hard though. Because
when you're doing something that's draining and

00:22:11.008 --> 00:22:15.873
emotional and depressing and you're in that state
for a long period of time, it's really hard to

00:22:15.873 --> 00:22:22.240
shake that emotion out of your body. Like when I
recorded Fruits Basket, at the very end of it--

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.232
AUDIENCE: Oh God!

00:22:23.232 --> 00:22:26.977
LAURA: I remember coming out of the booth and
thinking that I was the worst actor in the world,

00:22:26.977 --> 00:22:28.306
and I was terrible and I was--

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:29.312
TRAVIS: Because you are.

00:22:29.312 --> 00:22:35.768
LAURA: ...doing a horrible job, and-- (laughter)
I love you. (laughter) Justin Cook had to be

00:22:35.768 --> 00:22:41.703
like "You-- it's sounding really good!" And
I was so in that state, in Tohru's headspace that,

00:22:41.703 --> 00:22:48.203
you know, I thought everything was really bad, so
it gets to you sometimes.

00:22:48.203 --> 00:22:49.487
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello Laura, hello Travis.

00:22:49.487 --> 00:22:50.105
LAURA: Hello.

00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:56.109
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hope you have a wonderful time
here. For this question, I need you two to think

00:22:56.109 --> 00:23:00.114
of two specific characters that you've portrayed
over the years, as anime, video games, or even

00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:07.482
Critical Roleâ€“ well not Critical Role, but games
like role playing games--

00:23:07.482 --> 00:23:08.352
LAURA: Okay.

00:23:08.352 --> 00:23:13.201
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you had the opportunity to
bring two of these characters into our reality so

00:23:13.201 --> 00:23:16.063
they could be your best friends to hang
out/drinking buddies/whatever,

00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:17.934
who would they be and why?

00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.391
TRAVIS: Oh geez.

00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:20.961
(laughter)

00:23:22.561 --> 00:23:24.771
AUDIENCE: Mustang? Mustang!

00:23:24.771 --> 00:23:28.776
TRAVIS: No, no, no! You don't want to be best
friends with Roy Mustang. He gets all the girls.

00:23:28.776 --> 00:23:30.693
LAURA: (laughing) He gets all the girls!

00:23:30.693 --> 00:23:35.993
TRAVIS: It sucks. I would have Thor be a best
friend because he would drink (as Thor) all of the

00:23:35.993 --> 00:23:40.914
ale that I would drink. (normal voice) And I would
not be best friends with Grog because we would get

00:23:40.914 --> 00:23:49.845
in fights every one or two days in a row.
Thor and [mumbly voice].

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:51.286
AUDIENCE: Batman!

00:23:51.286 --> 00:23:53.975
TRAVIS: Not Batman, that guy's a jerk.

00:23:53.975 --> 00:24:01.403
LAURA: I would probably choose Maka as one of--
She's so cool! And hopefully she brings

00:24:01.403 --> 00:24:03.909
Soul with her--

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.325
TRAVIS: (laughter) Hopefully!

00:24:05.325 --> 00:24:09.041
LAURA: Hopefully! I would be best friends with
Vex'ahlia.

00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:10.738
TRAVIS: Would you?

00:24:10.738 --> 00:24:13.561
LAURA: Yeah! Are you kidding? She's so
cool!

00:24:13.561 --> 00:24:16.466
TRAVIS: Meh, I don't know.

00:24:16.466 --> 00:24:19.769
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Personally, I'd be friends with
Lemley from Titansgrave.

00:24:19.769 --> 00:24:25.221
LAURA: Oh! Lemley! Are you kidding! But no, I
mean, she's crazy. She would-- I mean,

00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:26.183
she's awesome.

00:24:26.183 --> 00:24:28.081
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'd try Roy, believe it or not.

00:24:28.081 --> 00:24:29.683
TRAVIS: Would you? Nice, thanks.

00:24:30.813 --> 00:24:32.522
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello!

00:24:32.533 --> 00:24:33.732
LAURA: Hello hello!

00:24:33.732 --> 00:24:35.507
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is a question for Grog,
actually.

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:38.108
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah, I'm all ears. What do you
want to say?

00:24:38.108 --> 00:24:43.453
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, you see, I'm going to be a
barbarian soon and I need a little bit of tips and

00:24:43.453 --> 00:24:47.392
advice to know how to actually crack skulls.

00:24:47.392 --> 00:24:52.076
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah, cracking skulls is like a
lost art form, so here's what you do. You go out

00:24:52.076 --> 00:24:58.031
and grab skull A and you grab it with your hand,
and then you go and grab skull B and you grab it

00:24:58.031 --> 00:25:03.967
with your hand, and then you make A B smash! And
then you smash! again. And they're

00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:09.038
going "No please don't smash my head!" "Oh no it
hurts so much!" and smash! And then you keep

00:25:09.038 --> 00:25:13.845
smashing until they don't talk anymore. And then
you're a barbarian.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.357
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks.

00:25:15.357 --> 00:25:19.080
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah.

00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:22.111
LAURA: It's really technical, head smashing...

00:25:22.111 --> 00:25:23.630
TRAVIS: (as Grog) It's a lost art form, really.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.980
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.343
AUDIENCE: There's a lot of technique to that.

00:25:26.343 --> 00:25:28.116
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah, I learned it from a
samurai.

00:25:28.116 --> 00:25:30.015
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello!

00:25:30.015 --> 00:25:31.352
LAURA: Hello!

00:25:31.352 --> 00:25:34.086
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, I have a question, one for
Laura and then one for Travis.

00:25:34.086 --> 00:25:34.899
LAURA: Okay.

00:25:34.899 --> 00:25:35.450
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Laura.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.490
LAURA: Yes!

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As a huge RPG fan, I have to
mention one of your most underappreciated roles

00:25:40.876 --> 00:25:43.684
I've ever seen. KainÃ© from the game Nier.

00:25:43.684 --> 00:25:44.904
LAURA: Thank you.

00:25:44.904 --> 00:25:49.011
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Holy shit! I love the way you
were swearing your ass off!

00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:51.255
LAURA: Thank you so much.

00:25:51.255 --> 00:25:55.468
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It was beautiful. Sorry.

00:25:55.468 --> 00:26:00.630
LAURA: I would do it, but there-- we're all
old in this room, right?

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.497
TRAVIS: Take one look at--

00:26:01.497 --> 00:26:05.351
LAURA: There's video cameras, yeah-- uh hi.

00:26:05.351 --> 00:26:06.596
TRAVIS: I do see one child.

00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:09.669
LAURA: Oh, see, there you go, so I'm going to be
on my best behavior right now.

00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:12.678
AUDIENCE MEMBER: There's only one child.
And for Travis, how did it feel voicing

00:26:12.678 --> 00:26:16.034
the gag reels in BlazBlue as Relius Clover?

00:26:16.034 --> 00:26:19.454
TRAVIS: Uh-- I don't remember
them.

00:26:19.454 --> 00:26:21.006
LAURA: What!?

00:26:21.006 --> 00:26:25.624
TRAVIS: I think it was funny at the time but I
actually can't remember them. That's one of those

00:26:25.624 --> 00:26:29.700
games where we pop in for an hour or two and then
we leave and we don't ever know--

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.176
LAURA: We don't ever get to see it any more!

00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:32.494
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:26:32.494 --> 00:26:33.625
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, thank you.

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:34.913
LAURA and TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:26:34.913 --> 00:26:36.017
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi!

00:26:36.017 --> 00:26:36.563
TRAVIS: Hi!

00:26:36.563 --> 00:26:37.438
LAURA: Hello!

00:26:37.438 --> 00:26:40.284
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, I ask this question at
every single game panel and I always get really

00:26:40.284 --> 00:26:44.383
great answers, so I'm really excited to see yours.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever said in booth?

00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:47.564
TRAVIS: I have mine.

00:26:47.977 --> 00:26:50.113
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I feel like there's a list. But,
like, what is the weirdest thing?

00:26:50.113 --> 00:26:53.190
TRAVIS: In an anime called Glass Fleet--

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.686
LAURA: Oh, yeah, well.

00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:57.738
TRAVIS: I played this character called Cleo and
you play-- what was your character's name again?

00:26:57.738 --> 00:26:58.569
LAURA: Michel

00:26:58.569 --> 00:27:07.260
TRAVIS: Yeah, Michel. Cleo's call, like his
slogan, is he would take out his harmonica, flip

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:14.291
it through the air, catch it and say "Feel my
wind." I was likeâ€“ I could see it on

00:27:14.291 --> 00:27:17.013
the page like, "Feel my wind?

00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:18.953
TRAVIS: What does that mean? Is he farting?

00:27:18.953 --> 00:27:20.705
LAURA: I feel like something got lost in
translation.

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:23.912
TRAVIS: It doesn't make any sense. And then, sure
enough, at the end of the series, Laura's

00:27:23.912 --> 00:27:26.081
character comes up and says--

00:27:26.081 --> 00:27:33.483
LAURA: (as Michel) I feel it. I can
feel your wind. (normal voice) She's standing

00:27:33.483 --> 00:27:36.737
like right behind him as she says it.

00:27:36.737 --> 00:27:38.253
TRAVIS: That's when we both broke.

00:27:38.253 --> 00:27:42.757
LAURA: Yeah. There was amazing outtakes on
that on that project. I wish we could have released

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:47.732
just a whole DVD of the whole series
redubbed with just our outtakes.

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.289
TRAVIS: Yup!

00:27:49.488 --> 00:27:55.255
LAURA: Mine definitely came from some thing in
Shin-Chan. Pretty much almost everything Shin

00:27:55.255 --> 00:28:00.007
says, but-- (as Shin) I do remember sayingâ€“
cover your ears little one--

00:28:00.007 --> 00:28:01.560
TRAVIS: Earmuffs!

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:08.658
LAURA: (as Shin) Last one to the basement is a
dead hooker! They were playing CSI, I think is--

00:28:08.658 --> 00:28:10.797
TRAVIS: Like you say.

00:28:10.797 --> 00:28:12.497
LAURA: Like you say, yeah.

00:28:12.497 --> 00:28:13.929
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you so much.

00:28:13.929 --> 00:28:16.013
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

00:28:16.013 --> 00:28:16.847
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:28:16.847 --> 00:28:17.780
LAURA: Hi!

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.667
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've been wanting to ask this
forever. Omaru is my favorite anime from all time.

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:27.587
And shows like that, where you literally set your
wife on fire repeatedly â€“ spoilers â€“ and like

00:28:27.587 --> 00:28:33.493
InFamous where you disintegrated your husband--
(laughter) how awkward is that? And do you keep

00:28:33.493 --> 00:28:36.910
competition, like "oh, I killed you in this game"
or "I killed you in this series." Is that awkward?

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.042
(laughter)

00:28:39.042 --> 00:28:40.325
TRAVIS: Who's winning?

00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:41.710
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's the kill count?

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:42.947
TRAVIS: I think I'm winning.

00:28:42.947 --> 00:28:52.282
LAURA: Are you? We have not kept count, but now I
really want to add it up.

00:28:52.282 --> 00:28:55.216
INTERVIEWER: I think she wins by this much?

00:28:55.216 --> 00:28:56.570
LAURA: I feel like I've won.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.669
TRAVIS: What!? No!

00:28:58.669 --> 00:29:01.781
LAURA: I bet-- we've gotta go through them, we've
gotta go through and figure this out--

00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:03.039
AUDIENCE: Homework!

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:11.138
LAURA: I know, it's homework. I think somebody needs
to do the math on that. I think it's fun.

00:29:11.138 --> 00:29:18.840
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's so much fun. Or, like
(singsong voice) I get to kill you!

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.179
LAURA: It's so weird because why don't we ever
get cast on the same team?

00:29:22.179 --> 00:29:23.913
We're always on opposite sides.

00:29:23.913 --> 00:29:25.570
TRAVIS: No we get-- in Avengers on the same
team.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.384
LAURA: All right. Fine.

00:29:27.384 --> 00:29:31.451
TRAVIS: There are times when we're on the same
team. It's always fun though. It was weird doing

00:29:31.451 --> 00:29:35.904
FullMetal Alchemist because she went in and
recorded all of her death screams first and, you

00:29:35.904 --> 00:29:42.318
know, I'm married to her but I've never heard my
wife scream like she's being burned to death.

00:29:42.318 --> 00:29:46.527
I came in to her going "Aahhh!" and I'm
going "oh my gosh!"

00:29:46.527 --> 00:29:48.209
LAURA: I feel really bad.

00:29:48.209 --> 00:29:49.293
TRAVIS: Now I feel bad.

00:29:49.293 --> 00:29:52.309
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The same

00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:55.757
TRAVIS: Then you do it a couple of times and
you're like "This is amazing."

00:29:55.757 --> 00:29:57.858
LAURA: I'll bet.

00:29:57.858 --> 00:29:59.148
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you so much.

00:29:59.148 --> 00:30:00.028
TRAVIS: Cool!

00:30:00.028 --> 00:30:01.502
LAURA: Thank you!

00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:02.471
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello.

00:30:02.521 --> 00:30:03.835
TRAVIS: Mother of dragons.

00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:04.937
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes I am.

00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:06.008
LAURA: Dracarys.

00:30:06.008 --> 00:30:07.835
TRAVIS: There you go.

00:30:07.835 --> 00:30:11.942
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, I wanted to ask you guys if
you-- when you search for roles do you usually do

00:30:11.942 --> 00:30:16.389
them together? Like when you look for a job do you
go together?

00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:18.287
TRAVIS: That's a good question.

00:30:18.287 --> 00:30:20.009
LAURA: Yeah, no.

00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:22.650
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So it's coincidence when you get
together.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:27.569
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a total coincidence. We
audition separately. I don't think we've-- we

00:30:27.569 --> 00:30:35.000
might have auditioned together once or twice but
it's super rare. We usually audition on different days.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.384
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But for the same job? Well not
the same job but the show or game?

00:30:40.384 --> 00:30:41.433
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:44.217
TRAVIS: Because that show will come out and
they'll put out auditions for all of the

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:52.176
characters and we-- you can turn it down, pull it
down. There you go. We audition separately and if

00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:55.039
we get to be in the same show we're like <i>yay
double prizes.</i>

00:30:55.039 --> 00:31:02.054
LAURA: Yeah it's pretty cool. Like we went in and
they didn't even know we were married, they didn't

00:31:02.054 --> 00:31:07.461
even know we knew each other when we did InFamous.
In fact, one person at the company knew that we

00:31:07.461 --> 00:31:11.899
were married and they didn't tell anyone because
they didn't want it to affect anything because

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:19.086
they'll like, "Oh well this is Reggie's actual
wife coming in to play Delsin's girlfriend." Weird.

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:23.122
TRAVIS: Yeah. We showed up on the mocap stage in
the morning and I went over and got a cup of

00:31:23.122 --> 00:31:31.075
coffee and gave her a kiss then one of the guys
was like, "Oh shit, you guys are close. Wow you

00:31:31.075 --> 00:31:37.599
Californians are so informal, lovey-dovey that was
right on the mouth." I was like "Yeah man, watch

00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:40.735
this." and I reach over and pinch her ass. She's
like "Stop it!" He's like, "Dude you can't do

00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:45.081
that!" I'm like, "I bet you I can!"

00:31:49.236 --> 00:31:53.013
LAURA: That happened on Halo too. We showed up, we
walked into the stage together and they're like,

00:31:53.013 --> 00:31:56.078
"Did you guys drive together? That's weird."

00:31:56.078 --> 00:32:00.566
TRAVIS: I'm like, "Yeah we drove together." and
they're like, "Ah, ok, that's weird."

00:32:00.566 --> 00:32:03.871
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:32:03.871 --> 00:32:06.771
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello Travis and Miss Bailey.

00:32:06.771 --> 00:32:08.391
LAURA: Hello.

00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:11.041
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This question is mostly to
Travis--

00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:14.289
TRAVIS: You can turn it back up. There you go.

00:32:14.289 --> 00:32:25.730
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you were in Ginko's shoes from
Mushishi what mushi would you rather end, at least

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.549
if you were really fascinated or at the very least
being scared of?

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:35.036
TRAVIS: Oh, so Mushishi was this gorgeous anime
where I played a character named Ginko where that

00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:38.706
hunts these invisible creatures of the spirit
realm that only he can see.

00:32:38.706 --> 00:32:39.773
LAURA: It's beautiful.

00:32:39.773 --> 00:32:42.875
TRAVIS: Gorgeous. There is one that invades your
eyeballs.

00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:44.460
LAURA: I was in that episode.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:49.561
TRAVIS: You were! And it invades your eyeballs and
under the moonlight it comes pouring out of your

00:32:49.561 --> 00:32:55.830
eyes and straight up towards the sky which would
make me run the opposite direction. But I would

00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:00.939
like to avoid that one. Because that's freaky as
hell.

00:33:00.939 --> 00:33:04.348
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I bid adieu.

00:33:04.348 --> 00:33:09.388
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello guys. As I told you guys in
the booth I'm really looking forward to moving to

00:33:09.388 --> 00:33:16.838
LA soon to be a voice actor. I want to know how do
agents operate because I've had the privilege of

00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:21.559
working with Bang Zoom and I know they operate
kind of differently, since then you go in and then

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:27.463
you audition or speak directly to Mami or any of
those guys and then you get started. How do agents work?

00:33:27.463 --> 00:33:32.114
TRAVIS: It depends. Bang Zoom does a lot of
different projects, they do non-union work and

00:33:32.114 --> 00:33:40.153
union projects at the same time. They usually
really like a good demo. They like to hear your

00:33:40.153 --> 00:33:47.718
range, what kind of accents you can do, how much
flexibility you have. And that's pretty much it.

00:33:47.718 --> 00:33:49.621
AUDIENCE MEMBER: They do all the rest, right?

00:33:49.621 --> 00:33:50.137
TRAVIS: What's that?

00:33:50.137 --> 00:33:51.124
AUDIENCE MEMBER: They do the rest.

00:33:51.124 --> 00:33:52.052
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:33:52.052 --> 00:33:53.491
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hand over the demo, they take
over.

00:33:53.491 --> 00:34:00.045
LAURA: Yeah, agents are-- you have to send out
your demos and hope that they contact you because

00:34:00.045 --> 00:34:07.345
a lot of times it's hard to get an agent starting
out as an actor because they have limited slots in

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:13.834
their agencies and everything. It's good to find a
smaller agency that is good at building up talent

00:34:13.834 --> 00:34:19.557
when you're new. And so do some research on
boutique agencies or something like that. Also,

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:25.390
since you have worked at Bang Zoom, maybe talk to
some of the other actors or even Mami or something

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:31.660
at Bang Zoom and say, "What agencies do you work
with the most? After I worked with you a couple

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:38.080
times would it be okay if you recommended me to
that agent?" Because that's the best way to get in

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.346
and actually get signed is to have somebody that
is a client, somebody that hires people, to say,

00:34:44.346 --> 00:34:49.636
"I would hire this person. I would like for you to
meet with them." And then they'll know that you

00:34:49.636 --> 00:34:54.155
will get hired and they'll be able to submit on
auditions and everything.

00:34:54.155 --> 00:34:54.671
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:34:54.671 --> 00:34:55.623
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you guys so much.

00:34:55.623 --> 00:34:57.320
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:34:57.641 --> 00:35:00.973
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey guys. I have a question for
both of you. You were talking about Catherine,

00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:06.808
that's one of my favorite games ever. I wanted to know
what was the process for Catherine and have you played the

00:35:06.808 --> 00:35:09.328
game? Did you like it afterwards? What do you
think?

00:35:09.328 --> 00:35:10.560
TRAVIS: It's a hard game.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.790
LAURA: I played a little bit of it and it was-- I
sucked. But the recording process for it was,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.378
sadly, it was one at a time.

00:35:19.378 --> 00:35:25.252
TRAVIS: Yeah, we didn't record together. They did
a pretty good job of telling us what the basic

00:35:25.252 --> 00:35:30.674
story was but most of the time we didn't get to
hear what the other character sounded like and

00:35:30.674 --> 00:35:33.939
they didn't really make us aware of what the
gameplay was like.

00:35:33.939 --> 00:35:34.919
LAURA: No, no.

00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:38.651
TRAVIS: Also part of the gameplay was super hard.
We gave it a try. Like we try and play some of the

00:35:38.651 --> 00:35:43.488
games. If it's really, really difficult though we
will probably not play it.

00:35:43.488 --> 00:35:45.944
LAURA: Yeah well-- depending on the game.

00:35:45.944 --> 00:35:50.460
TRAVIS: Depending on how much we like it. Because
we have a very finite amount of free time and

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:55.690
there are games that require like 40 hours of
gameplay. We're like, we have to go play Dragon Age.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:03.738
LAURA: Like Dragon Age, like RPGs, like I'm in and
going to play it forever. But that was one of the

00:36:03.738 --> 00:36:09.391
games where I had no idea what I was until we had
recorded a bunch and Valerie Arem, who was the

00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:13.209
voice director on that, she's like, "I don't want
to tell you everything that's going to happen, so

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.597
we're going to record things." It's like you
thinking that you're one thing and then towards

00:36:17.597 --> 00:36:20.394
the end she was like "Just kidding." Now what
happens?

00:36:20.394 --> 00:36:21.495
TRAVIS: She wanted to make it a surprise.

00:36:21.495 --> 00:36:23.115
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:36:23.115 --> 00:36:24.349
LAURA: Thank you.

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.766
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:36:25.766 --> 00:36:26.767
TRAVIS: Hi.

00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:35.455
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm still kind of shocked about
the roles you guys have made-- I knew Laura being

00:36:35.455 --> 00:36:46.459
Lucina from Fire Emblem but I didn't know about
Travis being both King Garin and, surprisingly, Knuckles.

00:36:46.459 --> 00:36:47.911
TRAVIS: I dig that.

00:36:47.911 --> 00:37:13.256
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I kind of want to make-- Sorry--
I was wondering. Sorry I'm-- It was kind of an

00:37:13.256 --> 00:37:14.735
alt-right thing.

00:37:14.735 --> 00:37:15.717
TRAVIS: It wasn't.

00:37:15.717 --> 00:37:31.116
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I want to ask the both of you but
since one question per person. Ok, so-- Laura,

00:37:31.116 --> 00:37:39.086
were you expecting Lucina to be this big? And
Travis, how does it feel with working with--

00:37:39.086 --> 00:37:44.151
probably for both of you, how does it feel
working-- having worked on Fire Emblem?

00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:46.120
TRAVIS: Well done.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.558
LAURA: It's amazing having worked on Fire
Emblem. So happy to have been a part of that game.

00:37:50.558 --> 00:38:00.268
I had no idea Lucina was going to be as popular as
she is and that makes me so happy. That game, I

00:38:00.268 --> 00:38:03.524
didn't know the name of it when we were recording
it because a lot of times everything is a secret.

00:38:03.524 --> 00:38:09.464
You'll go in and they won't tell you what the
actual title is and so somebody came up and

00:38:09.464 --> 00:38:17.937
through the whole script my name was Marth. Like
it never changed to Lucina. Somebody came up and

00:38:17.937 --> 00:38:22.419
wanted me to sign something for Fire Emblem and
they were like, "You're Lucina!" and I was like,

00:38:22.419 --> 00:38:26.457
"Mmm no, I don't know what you're talking about. I
don't know what that game is." Finally I see a

00:38:26.457 --> 00:38:31.977
picture and went, "Oh! Oh Marth." and they're
like, "Oh yeah but Lucina." I get to back and look

00:38:31.977 --> 00:38:35.676
at all this stuff and I'm like, God I'm an idiot I
had no idea.

00:38:35.676 --> 00:38:39.280
TRAVIS: We didn't have a lot of sessions on that
game either, so it was only until we started to a

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.116
few conventions and we learned how much people
loved the game and how popular it was that we

00:38:44.116 --> 00:38:49.351
really started to appreciate how great of a story
it was. It was really great.

00:38:49.351 --> 00:38:52.485
LAURA: That game got me a discount on our dining
table.

00:38:52.485 --> 00:38:53.985
TRAVIS: Did it really?

00:38:53.985 --> 00:38:58.255
LAURA: It really did. I walked into the furniture
store and the guy wasn't really helping me and I

00:38:58.255 --> 00:39:03.807
was like, "I like this table." and he was like
"Ok." and he was on his console and playing Fire

00:39:03.807 --> 00:39:07.935
Emblem. I'm like, "Oh hey, that's me." and he's
like, "What? What do you want? What do you want?"

00:39:07.935 --> 00:39:11.019
TRAVIS: Thank you for your question.

00:39:11.019 --> 00:39:16.115
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello.

00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:16.912
LAURA: Hello.

00:39:16.912 --> 00:39:18.585
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I want to ask both of you.

00:39:18.585 --> 00:39:20.183
TRAVIS: Winry! Woo!

00:39:20.183 --> 00:39:21.216
LAURA: It took you that long?

00:39:21.216 --> 00:39:23.904
TRAVIS: Nah-- yeah.

00:39:25.285 --> 00:39:29.909
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What triggered you to get into
voice acting? How do you get there? How do you get

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.702
into voice acting?

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:37.670
TRAVIS: Good question. We both started out doing
film and TV, regular acting and stuff like that.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:44.427
Voiceover is a little more-- it's a different
skill set, so it's different than being able to

00:39:44.427 --> 00:39:49.392
use your face to act, being able to use your body
to act and being very subtle and not using your

00:39:49.392 --> 00:39:55.463
voice as much. You have a microphone so whenever
you're being recorded someone needs to know that

00:39:55.463 --> 00:40:05.455
you're angry or upset or jealous or there's rage
boiling under the surface. And we recognized we

00:40:05.455 --> 00:40:11.589
had the ability to communicate those things with
just our voice. There are a lot of people that try

00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:16.907
voice over, that come to it in games, that come
from the film and TV world, and it takes a while

00:40:16.907 --> 00:40:25.081
for them to get used to it. And being that we're
both really big gamers, we know what sort of

00:40:25.081 --> 00:40:30.730
dialogue is needed in certain projects. I really
loved Dragon Ball Z, so I watched it all the time,

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:35.802
so I really had an appreciation for anime. Laura
loves playing RPGs like Mass Effect and Dragon

00:40:35.802 --> 00:40:43.085
Age, and Elder Scrolls, and things like that, so
she really does very well in those types of

00:40:43.085 --> 00:40:50.581
recording sessions. If you really really want to
pursue voice over, we always say study and

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:56.241
practice acting as much as you can. Take classes,
see what your voice can do, see what you can do,

00:40:56.241 --> 00:41:02.244
try and surprise yourself. Record yourself, if you
have a phone; usually there's something to record

00:41:02.244 --> 00:41:07.215
your voice with, if you have a computer. Practice
trying to imitate different voices and see what

00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:12.868
kind of flexibility you have. It's just about
deciding what you really want and going for it.

00:41:12.868 --> 00:41:18.488
LAURA: It's good to read books out loud, as well,
because a lot of times, especially in voiceover,

00:41:18.488 --> 00:41:23.222
you don't get the script ahead of time. In
animation a lot of times you do, but in video

00:41:23.222 --> 00:41:28.110
games, you don't get the script. You're reading on
the fly, you're cold reading almost everything. To

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:35.488
be able to read a book out loud and not screw up
too much is a really good sign that you'll be able

00:41:35.488 --> 00:41:40.569
to do that sort of thing in the booth as well. And
also, I always think it's smart to take voice

00:41:40.569 --> 00:41:45.803
lessons, even if you don't want to be a singer.
Voice lessons help you increase your range, and

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:51.004
that made a big difference with me being able to
voice little girls and also people like Lust,

00:41:51.004 --> 00:41:53.937
because that range was there already.

00:41:53.937 --> 00:41:55.320
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well thank you.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.185
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

00:41:57.185 --> 00:41:59.597
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello again.

00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:00.841
LAURA: Hello.

00:42:00.841 --> 00:42:02.581
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is, without spoiling
anything,

00:42:02.581 --> 00:42:04.112
LAURA: Oh gosh.

00:42:04.112 --> 00:42:08.462
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How are you feeling knowing there
is no Critical Role next week after what happened

00:42:08.462 --> 00:42:10.827
in the last episode?

00:42:10.827 --> 00:42:12.564
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Holy shit!

00:42:13.855 --> 00:42:19.148
LAURA: No spoilers! We're always nervous going
in.

00:42:19.148 --> 00:42:21.217
TRAVIS: We're always nervous. I feel fine!

00:42:21.217 --> 00:42:23.014
(laughter)

00:42:23.014 --> 00:42:36.736
TRAVIS: I'm not worried. I mean, I don't know, I'm
feeling okay. We really don't know what to expect,

00:42:36.736 --> 00:42:42.262
but that's every week, that's the great thing
about D&amp;D is that it's very much like improv. We

00:42:42.262 --> 00:42:47.602
don't have a script, we don't have any idea what
we're going to do. Matt throws something at us and

00:42:47.602 --> 00:42:54.150
we just react. It's not like we can be really
disappointed if it goes wrong because it's not

00:42:54.150 --> 00:43:01.322
like we spent a ton of time going "This is the
best idea I have, it's foolproof and it can't go

00:43:01.322 --> 00:43:06.257
wrong." We're like (fart noise). We just make
stuff up.

00:43:06.257 --> 00:43:08.876
LAURA: Well, I think that's a Grog mentality as
well.

00:43:08.876 --> 00:43:10.625
TRAVIS: It's a good mentality to have.

00:43:10.625 --> 00:43:13.791
LAURA: Because for sure there's no way that Liam
is like "I'm going to fly by the seat of my

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.960
pants." Liam is like "What can I plan, what can I
plan, what can I plan?"

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.761
TRAVIS: Which is pointless.

00:43:18.761 --> 00:43:23.937
LAURA: There's no point. He planned what he was
going to do last week and that turned out well.

00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:27.181
TRAVIS: It went to shit real quick. There's really
no point in planning.

00:43:27.181 --> 00:43:28.602
LAURA: It's all about the dice roll.

00:43:28.602 --> 00:43:38.520
TRAVIS: Especially when your fate is decided by a
twenty sided dice. This is a great idea! One. Who cares?

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.388
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:43:42.388 --> 00:43:43.671
LAURA: Thank you.

00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:54.635
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is, for start, 
you know this series called Zelda, his name's Link.

00:43:55.661 --> 00:44:02.255
If he had more dialogue, what would you think
his voice would sound like?

00:44:02.255 --> 00:44:03.630
LAURA: What would his voice sound like?

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:07.488
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. If he has real dialogue.

00:44:09.042 --> 00:44:11.760
TRAVIS: (deep voice) He sound like this man.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.631
(laughter and cheers)

00:44:14.631 --> 00:44:20.701
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Yeah baby, my name is Link.
I'm trying to get after that legend of Zelda.

00:44:20.701 --> 00:44:26.969
(laughter)

00:44:26.969 --> 00:44:31.118
LAURA: Nice, very nice.

00:44:31.118 --> 00:44:33.003
TRAVIS: That's it, man.

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:34.073
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:44:34.073 --> 00:44:35.289
INTERVIEWER: I would play that game.

00:44:35.289 --> 00:44:42.976
TRAVIS: There you go. (deep voice) Got me a new
magic sword. How you like my pointy ears, baby?

00:44:45.427 --> 00:44:46.427
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's up?

00:44:46.427 --> 00:44:47.698
LAURA: Hi!

00:44:47.698 --> 00:44:51.633
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First of all, welcome to Puerto
Rico, if this is your first time, but anyway. My

00:44:51.633 --> 00:45:00.216
question is what is your favorite phrase from each
of the characters you've performed?

00:45:00.216 --> 00:45:01.430
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.152
LAURA: Every single character ever?

00:45:03.152 --> 00:45:04.971
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just choose one or two.

00:45:04.971 --> 00:45:09.874
LAURA: "My magic will tear you apart!"

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:12.809
(cheering)

00:45:12.809 --> 00:45:17.256
TRAVIS: "I would like to rage!"

00:45:18.844 --> 00:45:20.790
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you so much.

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.611
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:24.120
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey guys.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.578
LAURA: Hello!

00:45:25.578 --> 00:45:29.538
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Here's a quick question since
everyone's been rushing to the questions. Laura,

00:45:29.538 --> 00:45:39.652
how did it feel to be the president of the United
States of America? And fighting aliens.

00:45:39.652 --> 00:45:48.561
LAURA: Thank you for asking. It felt, well damn
it. It felt good. It felt f-ing good.

00:45:48.561 --> 00:45:51.772
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That is what I was hoping for
thank you.

00:45:51.772 --> 00:45:56.830
LAURA: F-ing good. An f-ing tiger? F-ing Burt
Reynolds, what?

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.214
(laughter)

00:45:58.214 --> 00:46:03.115
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey again. This one is aimed at
Travis. One of my favorite, favorite animes that I

00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:08.465
have seen you do is-- also Full Metal when I was a
teenager-- is Ouran High School Host Club where

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:09.420
you're Mori-senpai.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.899
(cheering)

00:46:10.899 --> 00:46:11.855
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:46:11.855 --> 00:46:16.522
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He is a man of few words and in
the blooper reel you lost it when Mori-senpai was

00:46:16.522 --> 00:46:21.525
trying to grab Honey away from the cake. How many
times did you lose it while watching the show?

00:46:21.525 --> 00:46:26.963
TRAVIS: I think I said more in the blooper reels
than I actually said in the show. Because all I

00:46:26.963 --> 00:46:37.180
did was, "(hums) Fancy tuna." I think I blew that
take six times. Six or seven times. It would start

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:41.913
and it looked so-- I think I was pretty tired too,
we'd been recording like, seven hours in a small

00:46:41.913 --> 00:46:43.633
little closet type booth.

00:46:43.633 --> 00:46:44.249
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You go crazy.

00:46:44.249 --> 00:46:51.635
TRAVIS: You go nuts. It looked really funny so I'd
be like, "(starts, laughs)" like I couldn't stop

00:46:51.635 --> 00:46:54.188
laughing. So probably six or seven times.

00:46:54.188 --> 00:46:54.937
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:55.668
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

00:46:55.668 --> 00:46:57.006
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, I made it.

00:46:57.006 --> 00:46:58.110
LAURA: Hello.

00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.325
TRAVIS: "I made it!"

00:46:59.325 --> 00:47:04.210
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is, how was it
voicing Catherine and Johnny for the game

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:07.084
Catherine and are you people who like the game?

00:47:07.084 --> 00:47:10.253
LAURA: It was awesome.

00:47:10.253 --> 00:47:16.571
TRAVIS: It was great! It was a lot of fun. I mean,
it was full of--

00:47:16.571 --> 00:47:18.767
LAURA: I'm trying to think of something that I
haven't said about Catherine!

00:47:18.767 --> 00:47:20.041
TRAVIS: I know!

00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:25.435
INTERVIEWER: Did you have an idea of the overall
theme of the game and how profound it ended up being?

00:47:25.435 --> 00:47:30.101
LAURA: Oh, yeah, well a lot of the game, what we
recorded was to picture which is really nice. It

00:47:30.101 --> 00:47:37.523
was kind of like recording an anime in that
regard? I got to see what her mannerisms were as

00:47:37.523 --> 00:47:44.012
we were recording so that really helped. I was
surprised because she has such a distinctive look

00:47:44.012 --> 00:47:50.834
about her-- did you like the way I phrased that?
That the voice that they wanted was such a

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:56.536
youthful, sweet, innocent sort of voice. But then
after it was explained, after we got to the point

00:47:56.536 --> 00:48:02.580
that it was, and I realized what she was and why
she behaved the way she did, it made perfect sense

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:10.492
for her to have that very youthful innocent sort
of sound because, I mean it was so perfect. It was

00:48:10.492 --> 00:48:15.631
such an amazing project to be a part of and get to
work with Travis and Troy and all of our best

00:48:15.631 --> 00:48:18.427
friends on that game, is awesome.

00:48:18.427 --> 00:48:23.605
TRAVIS: It was a close-knit crew. And it's like
the main difference between anime and original

00:48:23.605 --> 00:48:28.317
animation stuff is that with anime or projects
that are like Catherine, there's an animation that

00:48:28.317 --> 00:48:33.770
already exists so we have to dub to it, right?
We're kind of confined to what's already drawn.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:38.775
The lip flaps don't change, you can't make stuff
up. But with original animation you can be as

00:48:38.775 --> 00:48:43.524
crazy as you want to and then they'll animate you
so it's two totally different processes.

00:48:43.524 --> 00:48:49.925
LAURA: And if I remember correctly on Catherine
some of the mouth hadn't been animated yet. They

00:48:49.925 --> 00:48:56.532
were still working out the mechanics for how the
mouth was going to move with the dialogue so we

00:48:56.532 --> 00:49:03.670
were actually recording to sound files matching
the timing of the Japanese sound files as opposed

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:09.038
to matching the actual animation. That's a whole
different sort of process when you're recording

00:49:09.038 --> 00:49:13.804
long chunks of dialogue to specific timing is very
very strange.

00:49:13.804 --> 00:49:15.040
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.036
LAURA: Thank you!

00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:18.186
(applause)

00:49:18.186 --> 00:49:21.292
LAURA: Is that it? Aw man!

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:28.362
INTERVIEWER: We're running out of time, but are we
grateful that Travis and Laura came to Puerto Rico

00:49:28.362 --> 00:49:29.363
to come visit us?

00:49:29.363 --> 00:49:32.949
(cheering)

00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:39.150
INTERVIEWER: We are so so grateful for your visit
for sharing this little-- it was a very

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:44.324
enjoyable experience. I was wondering, in every
conference we have in the video game conference

00:49:44.324 --> 00:49:47.736
room we've taken a selfie with the public.

00:49:47.736 --> 00:49:49.188
LAURA: Oh awesome! Yeah!

00:49:49.188 --> 00:49:50.591
INTERVIEWER: And would you be willing to do--

00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:51.291
TRAVIS: Yeah totally!

00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:52.271
LAURA: Yeah that's awesome!

00:49:52.271 --> 00:49:52.907
INTERVIEWER: Perfect.

00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:53.707
LAURA: Do we just come down there?

00:49:53.707 --> 00:49:55.295
INTERVIEWER: No, they need to come--

00:49:55.295 --> 00:49:57.082
LAURA: They need to come up! Oh, awesome!

00:49:57.082 --> 00:49:59.211
INTERVIEWER: Down to the stage, down to the
stage.

00:49:59.211 --> 00:50:01.912
(murmuring)

00:50:01.912 --> 00:50:03.881
LAURA: We should turn around and take the
picture?

00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:05.314
INTERVIEWER: No someone is going to come up--

00:50:05.314 --> 00:50:08.081
LAURA: Oh awesome!

00:50:08.323 --> 00:50:10.014
LAURA: Oh my gosh this is so exciting!

00:50:14.086 --> 00:50:16.216
LAURA: Do you want to stand on a chair?

00:50:16.216 --> 00:50:18.254
CAMERA MAN: I think I should, right?

00:50:26.489 --> 00:50:28.975
(cheering)

00:50:28.975 --> 00:50:33.223
LAURA: I kind of want to take a selfie this way,
too! Hold on.

00:50:37.946 --> 00:50:48.351
CAMERA MAN: Okay one, two, three! That's it.

00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:50.219
(cheering)

00:50:50.219 --> 00:50:52.452
CAMERA MAN: Everyone together! Okay. You got to get
in there.

00:50:52.452 --> 00:50:53.604
(laughter)

00:50:53.604 --> 00:50:55.001
CAMERA MAN: All right! One, two, and, three! Now I
want you to scream!

00:50:55.001 --> 00:50:58.676
(cheering)

00:51:32.767 --> 00:52:04.098
(music)
