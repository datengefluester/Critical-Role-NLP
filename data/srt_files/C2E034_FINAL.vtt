NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:03.758
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:06.399
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.041
(cheering)

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.406
MATT: Before we dive into tonight's episode, let's
get through some quick announcements for the

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:18.031
evening. First, we have two fantastic sponsors.
Returning from earlier, near the beginning of the

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.380
campaign, our friends at D&D Beyond.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.432
(cheering)

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:23.005
MATT: Sam?

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:27.501
MAX: Hey everyone! It's me, Sam Riegel, the
wackiest guy in D&D, to tell you about D&D Beyond!

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:32.288
I love D&D Beyond because it helps me organize my
character, Nott the Brave, so I can concentrate on

00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:34.732
being zany and doing Nott's voice.

00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:37.232
LAURA: Do the voice, Sam! You're so good at it!

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:42.072
MAX: (as Nott, but badly) Pip pip cheerio! Mystery
solved! Roar! Buttons!

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:43.750
TRAVIS: Oh yes.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.012
LAURA: That was really good.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:50.149
MAX: Anyway, being wacky Sam Riegel means I get to
tell you that Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is now

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.365
available on dndbeyond.com and will guide your
Waterdeep campaigns from level one to five. For

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.557
levels five to 20, explore the legendary
undermountain dungeon below the city with

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:03.598
Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, which is
available for preorder and will release on

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:05.070
November 2nd. And you guys--

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.960
SAM: (shouting) What the fuck is going on?! What--
Max?! Are you in my seat?! Go away! Go! What the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.434
fuck is happening?! Travis, you emailed me. You
said we were starting at 7:15 tonight. Did you lie

00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:23.350
to me?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.602
TRAVIS: No! Yes. Okay, look. Listen, man. It's
nothing personal, it's just last week's spot was a

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:34.120
little rough, and we needed to have a safe,
non-offensive spot this week.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.095
SAM: And you thought no one could tell the
difference between me and Max?

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:40.074
TALIESIN: Honestly, I'm still not sure which of
you is Sam.

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:41.352
SAM: <i>I'm</i> Sam!

00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:43.695
LAURA: Are you Max?

00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:49.461
SAM: I'm offended at this, guys. My spots are not
controversial in any way.

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:52.634
TRAVIS: Oh yeah? Did you write something for
tonight?

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:54.665
SAM: Yes, I do. I have it on my phone.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:59.199
TRAVIS: Did it involve fart sounds? Offensive
stereotypes? Cursing? Violence? Inappropriate uses

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.627
of pickles and/or cucumbers?

00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:04.183
SAM: It might have. Yes.

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:09.236
TRAVIS: You can't be trusted, dude. Listen. Read
what we wrote for you there. It's a hundred

00:02:09.236 --> 00:02:12.972
percent safe, non-offensive. The jokes are
approved, so go ahead.

00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:25.442
SAM: Fine. (clears throat) It's me, Sam Riegel,
the wackiest guy in D&D, telling you to head on

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:32.666
over to D&D Beyond, where their new content is
like anti-gravity; it's impossible to put down. On

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:38.965
D&D Beyond, my username is "benefits." That way,
if you add me to your party, it'll say we're

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:44.761
friends with benefits. No, seriously though, my
username is "forrestgump," and my password is

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.898
"1forrest1."

00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:48.910
TRAVIS: Even better coming out of your mouth.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.142
SAM: Did you write this?

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:53.547
TRAVIS: Yeah. Come on. Wrap it up. Let's go.

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:59.389
SAM: Well, wakka wakka wakka! Thanks, D&D Beyond,
this was wacky Sam Riegel saying, "Go Dallas?!"

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.199
Fuck you! Back to you, Matt.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.080
(laughter)

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.214
TALIESIN: That was great, Max.

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:09.675
LIAM: I liked long-haired Sam.

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:13.534
TRAVIS: Can we switch him after the intro?

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:19.175
MATT: It's a cantrip. Thank you, D&D Beyond. Thank
you, Sax. Mam.

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:20.434
SAM: I'm Sam.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:23.115
MATT: You're Mam. Smax. I like that. We'll go with
that.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:25.540
TRAVIS: Max did really good at getting through
that, by the way.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.618
MATT: And our secondary sponsor tonight, returning
from last week, our friends at Raven and the Rook

00:03:32.952 --> 00:03:40.799
have their Kickstarter up for their awesome,
fantastic Far Traveler's Collection notebooks for

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.511
you to keep all of your campaign notes in. All of
the leather is engraved, and you have all the

00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:50.623
different sheets for your character spell
information and everything else. The quality is

00:03:50.623 --> 00:03:52.413
pretty badass, actually.

00:03:52.413 --> 00:03:55.725
MARISHA: I just have the one. That's good, because
you can keep adding paper to it.

00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:59.530
TRAVIS: You can add paper once you write too big,
like you do? Nice.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.526
MARISHA: I don't write too big.

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:03.645
MATT: Comparatively.

00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:07.387
MARISHA: I don't have only four words on this.

00:04:07.387 --> 00:04:15.305
MATT: It's not too bad. That's sixth-grade font
size. That's how I adjust font sizes, by what

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:21.925
grade I was in, I guess. I don't know why. The
collection features a deluxe edition of their

00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:27.477
Mischief & Misadventures Campaign Diary, as well
as the new Far Traveler's Notebook, which has the

00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:32.428
fantastic covers that you see here from our
fantastic friend, Deven Rue, to the show. Plus,

00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:36.677
all reward tiers will include a free
Kickstarter-exclusive Voyager's Pack, which is

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:41.921
essential for the Blind Bundle box. Become a
backer now at therookandtheraven.com/criticalrole

00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:48.848
before the Kickstarter ends on September 20th. Go
check it out. It's good stuff. That's our

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:55.082
sponsorship for the night. A few quick updates. A
reminder to you guys that we are doing our very

00:04:55.082 --> 00:05:00.886
first live show in New York City, coming up
beginning of next month! We are at The Palace in

00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:05.497
Washington Heights on Thursday, October 4th.
Tickets are still available at Ticketmaster. You

00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:07.086
can check out more information-- pardon me.

00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:08.524
LAURA: Did you just burp?

00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:13.215
MATT: I did. I was scarfing food before we started
the show. I'm sorry. Details at critrole.com.

00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:19.559
Those who were here earlier in the week saw that
our Twitch subs are now live! We have a bunch of

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:25.074
new content releasing now and will be releasing
soon. We announced a few new shows that are going

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:26.728
to be coming up very soon, actually.

00:05:26.728 --> 00:05:27.927
MARISHA: Monday!

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.265
MATT: Yeah, do you want to talk about that?

00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:36.109
MARISHA: Between the Sheets! That was on Monday!
That show is a one-on-one deep dive with Brian W.

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:41.754
Foster, where he talks about how storytellers
became storytellers, and he's starting with

00:05:41.754 --> 00:05:44.519
Taliesin, and he teaches you how to make a
cocktail.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:45.978
MATT: There you go.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:46.629
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.753
LAURA: That was really good, Marisha. Are you
really Marisha?

00:05:49.753 --> 00:05:52.302
SAM: You're wearing sleeves.

00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:54.323
LAURA: I know. I don't believe it.

00:05:54.323 --> 00:05:56.864
TRAVIS: (gasps) It's a lie! Shank!

00:05:56.864 --> 00:05:57.644
MARISHA: Oh god!

00:05:57.644 --> 00:06:01.433
(laughter)

00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:02.767
TRAVIS: I got her! I took care of her!

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:04.818
MATT: Good. Thank you, Travis. Good looking out.

00:06:04.818 --> 00:06:09.072
MARISHA: What if I morphed, though? You weren't
supposed to know!

00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:17.509
MATT: Species level tears him in half. Anyway,
Between the Sheets! Mondays on our Twitch channel!

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.981
Beginning with interviews with the cast of
Critical Role, and from there, expanding out into

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:24.659
different friends of the show and beyond. We'll
have a lot of great perspectives and people of

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:30.641
different backgrounds and ideas. It's going to be
a really fun show. We also announced the upcoming

00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:34.304
show for All Work, No Play, for these two handsome
gentlemen here.

00:06:34.304 --> 00:06:37.530
SAM: Us? We have a show again.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.901
TRAVIS: I'm so happy!

00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:41.380
SAM: One a year.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.309
LIAM: We hold hands the whole time.

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:52.475
MATT: Yeah. Look for information on that and all
our upcoming content at critrole.com. We're also

00:06:52.475 --> 00:06:54.349
raising money for Sam's favorite charity.

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.722
SAM: Yes, the Pablove Foundation raises money to
battle childhood cancer, and we're supporting

00:06:58.722 --> 00:07:06.611
Blair Herter on his ride from San Francisco to Los
Angeles. We've raised over $64,000, maybe more by

00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:12.464
now. I haven't checked in a little while. We're
trying to get to $100,000, and if we do, we will

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:18.949
get to unlock me doing a Fireside Chat.

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:21.305
LAURA: Are you going to be naked for it?

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:23.755
SAM: I will do anything for $100,000.

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:26.992
(laughing)

00:07:26.992 --> 00:07:28.531
MATT: It does go to the charity.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:33.518
SAM: That's fine. That still counts. We've already
unlocked a one-shot that we'll be announcing more

00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:42.541
details about later, and we've also supported one
whole grant that will be donated to a scientist

00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:46.193
who will do cutting-edge research. So thank you.
Keep giving!

00:07:46.193 --> 00:07:50.185
MATT: Thank you, guys, for being amazing and
supportive of this fantastic charity push. More to

00:07:50.185 --> 00:07:59.350
come! As part of that, we are announcing that the
special one-shot is-- it's on my list here. Do you

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.320
want to talk about it?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.277
SAM: We're doing a one-shot of Crash Pandas. I'll
be running the game with some of the people at

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:13.045
this very table, and it's going to be released on
the 28th of September. I think?

00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:14.087
MARISHA: 21st.

00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:17.401
SAM: <i>21st</i> of September! It's live on the 21st of
September!

00:08:17.401 --> 00:08:21.315
MATT: 7pm on this channel. Next Friday the 21st.

00:08:21.315 --> 00:08:22.563
SAM: I've got to write this thing.

00:08:22.563 --> 00:08:26.874
MATT: You better get on that, buddy! The VOD will
be available on Sunday at

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.086
youtube.com/criticalrole. Look for that.

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:34.435
MARISHA: Crash Pandas, of course, done by the same
guy, Grant Howitt, who did Honey Heist. You can

00:08:34.435 --> 00:08:39.836
download all of his games for free. Search his
Patreon and support him, because he makes free

00:08:39.836 --> 00:08:44.105
games for people. That's a nice thing to do with
your life.

00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:46.059
TRAVIS: Life goals.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:54.692
MATT: And with that, I believe our announcements
are complete. Without further ado, let's jump into

00:08:54.692 --> 00:08:57.755
tonight's episode of Critical Role!

00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:03.348
[click, TV static]

00:09:03.348 --> 00:10:21.848
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:26.386
TRAVIS: Yeah, Taliesin! Double guns!

00:10:26.386 --> 00:10:28.148
TALIESIN: Long game, motherfucker.

00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:35.867
MATT: Welcome back. Cool. Last we left off, The
Mighty Nein had made their way south, absconding

00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:44.060
from the tensions of the north Dwendalian Empire
to seek a few possible threads of mystery to the

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.876
south shores and coasts of the Menagerie Coast.
You made your way through the Wuyun Gorge,

00:10:49.876 --> 00:10:56.626
purchased a few pets, and then eventually found
yourselves-- for many of you, your first time-- at

00:10:56.626 --> 00:11:03.085
the beach, at the coast, seeing an ocean, seeing
the waves, seeing the sand, and took a brief bit

00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:08.832
of time to relish in that experience. Eventually
making your way to Nicodranas in time for the

00:11:08.832 --> 00:11:19.560
sunset across the western ocean. You began to
notice the workforce that goes through the day and

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.429
dwindles to the night that works alongside the
numerous number of ships that come in and then

00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:31.630
stay along the wharf and the various docks in the
vicinity. You made your way through the-- not very

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:38.953
stealthy. But we're not in character yet, so I'll
allow it. You made your way throughout various

00:11:38.953 --> 00:11:47.482
districts of the city, eventually meeting the
fantastic and long-presented mother of Jester: The

00:11:47.482 --> 00:11:53.962
Ruby of the Sea, Marion Lavorre. After having some
time to catch up with her, exchange information

00:11:53.962 --> 00:12:01.101
about your travels, you discovered that there had
been some issues with one client of hers in the

00:12:01.101 --> 00:12:06.132
town, and managed to gather a little bit of
information, but began to seek more about this

00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:14.573
Algar, this figure who had grown jealous of other
clientele and seemed to be becoming a point of

00:12:14.573 --> 00:12:20.406
concern for Marion. You took it upon yourselves to
look into this individual, and find a way to

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:28.486
possibly resolve this while you were in town. You
also began to run into some other curious

00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:34.691
mysteries. You went to the lighthouse and spoke
with the lighthouse keeper there for a bit. You

00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.747
had found a strange tower in the Open Quay.

00:12:37.747 --> 00:12:38.808
TRAVIS: Fucked up.

00:12:38.808 --> 00:12:48.624
MATT: (laughs) Then eventually discovered, along
the wharf, a tavern with a familiar name based on

00:12:48.624 --> 00:12:54.828
some of the previous things you were keeping an
eye out for: the Wayfarer's Cove. You had just

00:12:54.828 --> 00:13:06.545
stepped into the darkened interior of this, the
smell of old, wet wood combined with the dried

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:15.636
liquors and ales that had long stained the various
tables and floorboards of this dank and relatively

00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:26.564
musty bar. Looking across the clientele, a few
interesting persons caught your attention, and

00:13:26.564 --> 00:13:34.228
that's where we left off. So, Mighty Nein, as you
begin to enter this darkened, torch-lit interior--

00:13:34.228 --> 00:13:42.257
lantern, I would say, slowly hanging from various
portions of the ceiling, crossbeams, the bits of

00:13:42.257 --> 00:13:47.646
wind that push them, causing them to slightly
shift and have this shifting crackle of firelight

00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:50.584
within the chamber, what do you wish to do?

00:13:50.584 --> 00:13:58.111
TRAVIS: I've never seen a-- I mean, I've seen one,
but I've never spoken to a--

00:13:58.111 --> 00:13:59.586
MARISHA: Turtle person?

00:13:59.586 --> 00:14:00.242
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:14:00.242 --> 00:14:06.016
MARISHA: Yeah. Pretty cool-looking. I don't think
I've ever actually saw one, either. I've only seen pictures.

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:08.071
TRAVIS: Is that an eye patch?

00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:10.011
MARISHA: Are those tattoos?

00:14:10.011 --> 00:14:11.453
LAURA: Is that a shell?

00:14:11.453 --> 00:14:13.288
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:16.234
MARISHA: Should we talk to him first?

00:14:16.234 --> 00:14:21.831
TRAVIS: Yeah. Who wants to talk to-- no? Nott?

00:14:21.831 --> 00:14:23.764
SAM: No! That looks crazy.

00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:27.846
LIAM: What are those things coming out of the
shell? Green tubes?

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:29.385
LAURA: Are you a turtle?

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:31.022
MATT: Do you walk up and approach him?

00:14:31.022 --> 00:14:32.349
LAURA: Yeah, I'm a shithead.

00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:34.218
TRAVIS: We're all going to fight.

00:14:34.218 --> 00:14:40.760
MATT: Sitting there on the table, both these
large, scaled, coming to the point of these hooked

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.589
claws, these hands are wrapped around this heavy
tankard. The head shifts over your direction where

00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:52.603
the eye patch meets your gaze first before the
other eye creeps past the extending hard brow.

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:58.879
"I'm sorry, what you asking, eh?"

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:06.459
LAURA: I was asking how you got your eye patch.
Did you-- did somebody shoot it out of your eye?

00:15:07.623 --> 00:15:14.232
MATT: "Well t-that's certainly a possibility,
<i>cher.</i>"

00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:17.463
LAURA: You don't remember?

00:15:20.863 --> 00:15:30.587
MATT: "You don't think that perhaps someone's
going to tell you their life story just without

00:15:30.587 --> 00:15:35.088
"even knowing you? You can buy me a drink first."

00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:39.157
LAURA: Oh yeah, I will buy you a drink if you tell
me how your eyeball went missing!

00:15:39.157 --> 00:15:41.093
MATT: "Very well."

00:15:41.093 --> 00:15:42.937
SAM: Ask him what he wants.

00:15:42.937 --> 00:15:47.266
LAURA: What-- oh do you not want milk? Do you want
something else?

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:54.385
MATT: "(sighs)" He raises one of his fingers up
towards the bar and the bartender glances up. "Oh

00:15:54.385 --> 00:16:03.241
another round, okay." He turns around and begins
preparing what looks to be another drink. Lowers

00:16:03.241 --> 00:16:09.681
his hand and claw which scrapes across the wood
and leaves this little curl of-- little shaving

00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:17.000
that is put to the side as his hand comes to rest,
looking back at you with his one eye. "How about

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.401
this then? Let's trade a story, huh?"

00:16:21.401 --> 00:16:22.560
LAURA: Okay.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:35.280
MATT: "Y-you tell me where you're from and why it
brought you in to my table, then m-maybe I'll tell

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.719
you how I lost this, yeah?"

00:16:38.876 --> 00:16:51.385
LAURA: Okay. Well I'm from up the street kind of.
I'm the daughter of the Ruby of the Sea. Do you

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:53.911
work for any government officials?

00:16:53.911 --> 00:16:56.458
MATT: "(laughs) No."

00:16:56.458 --> 00:17:03.484
LAURA: I'm the daughter of the Ruby of the Sea.
And you know these are my friends and we've gotten

00:17:03.635 --> 00:17:09.123
into a lot of hijinks and um... what all did you
want to know?

00:17:09.123 --> 00:17:14.145
MATT: Drink gets brought down to the table. "Don't
worry, she's going to take care of it."

00:17:14.145 --> 00:17:17.934
LAURA: Yes. Do you have money to take care of it?

00:17:17.934 --> 00:17:18.880
SAM: Sure.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.745
TALIESIN: You've got it? Because I was going to go
get some milk too. Two milks also. One hot please.

00:17:24.745 --> 00:17:26.165
Two milks, one hot.

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:28.551
MATT: It's a silver for that so it's an easy trade
off.

00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:31.859
MARISHA: We order anything other than milk
please.

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:37.339
MATT: Okay, well for a round of drinks and the
milks involved as well, that'll put you we'll say

00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:41.634
at about... two silver.

00:17:41.634 --> 00:17:46.095
LAURA: It's also possible that we met my dad
earlier and we didn't know it.

00:17:46.852 --> 00:17:59.433
MATT: "I'm going to be perfectly honest: that was
a lot m-more than I was asking. But I appreciate it."

00:17:59.433 --> 00:18:05.490
LAURA: Okay. I appreciate you too. How did you get
those pipes on your back?

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.943
(laughter)

00:18:07.943 --> 00:18:11.916
MATT: He turns and you hear the creaking of
leather as the long extended neck turns, the folds

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:22.132
of skin pushing against themselves. "Oh this? Got
this here on sea maybe about... six or seven years ago."

00:18:22.132 --> 00:18:26.582
TRAVIS: Oh boy. (laughs)

00:18:26.582 --> 00:18:28.086
LIAM: What do they do?

00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:33.564
MATT: He reaches back and you can see-- it's
interesting because on the right side of the shell

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:37.503
it looks like elements have been carved through
where these pipes have been put in on the back. On

00:18:37.503 --> 00:18:44.896
the front there's a small deflated pouch of
leather and a small extended tube of metal. He

00:18:44.896 --> 00:18:52.096
lifts it with one hand and breathes into it and it
inflates a bit and inflates a bit. You see his one

00:18:52.096 --> 00:18:59.605
eye look around mischievously to everyone else at
the bar and goes, "I mean y-you asked."

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:08.911
(terrible bagpipe wails) This trio of
bagpipes begin blasting out of these large, almost

00:19:08.911 --> 00:19:14.413
shell-sculpted pipes that curve out of his shell
and everyone in the room just immediately starts

00:19:14.413 --> 00:19:19.468
grabbing their ears going "Ah!" and start throwing
things over, clanking off of his shell.

00:19:19.468 --> 00:19:22.920
TRAVIS: Oh my god, fake bagpipe sound is best
bagpipe sound.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.341
(laughter)

00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:28.051
TALIESIN: What is happening? I don't know
anymore.

00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:30.123
SAM: He's so good! That was good!

00:19:30.123 --> 00:19:34.418
MATT: Only a few notes in because while he's
mischievously enjoying the moment of shattering

00:19:34.418 --> 00:19:39.667
the calm and chill in the chamber he's not going
to get himself thrown out, so he stops and goes

00:19:39.667 --> 00:19:47.203
"That there's how I keep the other shipmates...
entertained."

00:19:47.203 --> 00:19:51.069
MARISHA: Entertained. Yeah.

00:19:51.069 --> 00:19:54.437
SAM: It's a very good skill, you're quite
talented. Really.

00:19:54.437 --> 00:19:58.949
TALIESIN: What's your typical rank on board ship
if you don't mind me asking?

00:19:58.949 --> 00:20:09.811
MATT: "It's been a number of m-m-months since I
found me a good ship and a purpose out there on

00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:16.988
"the ocean sea, but I've been known to be a rather
decent second mate and navigator."

00:20:16.988 --> 00:20:19.168
TALIESIN: Very cool.

00:20:19.168 --> 00:20:21.331
LAURA: Is your name Marius?

00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:25.642
MATT: "That's not my m-m-moniker."

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.465
(laughter)

00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:28.935
LAURA: Okay.

00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:31.826
TRAVIS: What is your name, friend?

00:20:31.826 --> 00:20:34.118
MATT: "Orly."

00:20:34.118 --> 00:20:35.808
MARISHA: Orly?

00:20:35.808 --> 00:20:37.665
MATT: "Orly Skiffback."

00:20:37.665 --> 00:20:39.305
MARISHA: Orly Skid--

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:40.856
MATT: "Skiffback."

00:20:40.856 --> 00:20:44.104
TRAVIS: You better skip back!

00:20:44.104 --> 00:20:54.373
MATT: "Now, I've been forthcoming in my d-direct
title. M-m-might I ask what your individual names

00:20:54.373 --> 00:20:55.766
"may be?"

00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:59.051
TRAVIS: Well of course. My name is Fjord.

00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:01.228
MARISHA: And I'm Beau.

00:21:01.228 --> 00:21:04.056
LIAM: Caleb Widogast.

00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:07.897
SAM: Junior.

00:21:07.897 --> 00:21:10.581
LAURA: Nancy.

00:21:10.581 --> 00:21:14.491
TALIESIN: Caduceus. I don't-- okay, yeah.

00:21:14.491 --> 00:21:18.381
(laughter)

00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:26.743
MATT: "Very well. Welcome to this shithole." He
grabs his drink and sips. Takes a few moments and

00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:32.981
looks around again. "Y'all still lingering for
some reason?"

00:21:33.012 --> 00:21:38.460
TRAVIS: You say it's been a few months since your
last passage on a ship. Steady work?

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.158
SAM: Did he slip into it?

00:21:42.158 --> 00:21:43.434
TRAVIS: Did I?

00:21:43.434 --> 00:21:44.924
LAURA: You started sliding--

00:21:44.924 --> 00:21:47.160
(laughter)

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:56.533
TRAVIS: (grunts) Stay away! Stay away! Southern
accent! Trying to Texas, Georgia, Louisiana!

00:21:56.533 --> 00:22:01.283
(laughter)

00:22:01.283 --> 00:22:02.803
MARISHA: Just go on a little walkabout.

00:22:02.803 --> 00:22:09.476
TRAVIS: We're looking for an individual that might
frequent these parts. Half-elf gentleman. You seen

00:22:09.476 --> 00:22:12.064
anyone named Sabian in these parts?

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:24.890
MATT: "Can't say that I have there son, my
apologies. However you're m-m-more than welcome to

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:32.596
"ask around. I'm sure there's a whole mighty
spectrum of curious travelers that come in and out

00:22:32.596 --> 00:22:34.406
"of here."

00:22:34.406 --> 00:22:38.446
TRAVIS: Have you not been on a ship because of a
lack of opportunity, or if the right situation

00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:43.052
presented itself you would be perhaps up for a bit
of work?

00:22:43.052 --> 00:22:57.393
MATT: "More the latter than the former. I got to
jive with the right crew. More like they got to

00:22:57.393 --> 00:23:05.816
"jive with me. I mean--" and he does this
I'm-a-fucking-tortle physicality to it.

00:23:07.087 --> 00:23:09.092
LAURA: It's the bagpipes, isn't it?

00:23:09.092 --> 00:23:12.806
MATT: "Well, they're an acquired taste I'd say
perhaps, <i>cherie.</i>"

00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:18.861
SAM: Judging by your physique though you must be
quite excellent on the water.

00:23:18.861 --> 00:23:22.247
MATT: "Yeah, I'd say so."

00:23:22.247 --> 00:23:30.454
SAM: I'm sure you're an asset to any vessel. Now
that I've buttered you up-- how about-- have you

00:23:30.454 --> 00:23:32.905
ever heard of Marius LePual?

00:23:32.905 --> 00:23:34.897
MATT: "Why you asking?"

00:23:34.897 --> 00:23:35.467
SAM: Oh!

00:23:35.467 --> 00:23:38.871
MATT: "If I m-might inquire."

00:23:38.871 --> 00:23:48.901
SAM: Well as one green to another, we were just
told that he might be around and he has some

00:23:49.008 --> 00:23:55.518
information that we were looking for. We are
actually trying to deliver him a bit of correspondence.

00:23:55.518 --> 00:23:58.454
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:23:58.454 --> 00:24:06.621
SAM: Oh that will go over great. Ooh! Minus
three... oh no. Persuasion is at zero? How did that

00:24:06.621 --> 00:24:09.188
happen? Anyway it's 13.

00:24:11.708 --> 00:24:13.522
LAURA: You're proficient.

00:24:13.522 --> 00:24:18.620
SAM: Oh I'm proficient at persuasion. Wow, who
knew?

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.873
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:24:19.873 --> 00:24:28.960
MATT: "I can say I've seen him around.
Occasionally the boy has needed a place to crash

00:24:29.102 --> 00:24:37.132
"and I've provided my shack, my abode, when he's
been drinking too hard or comes in with some sort

00:24:37.132 --> 00:24:40.280
"of a m-mark on his face."

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.101
SAM: You're roommates with Marius?

00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:45.567
MATT: "Only in occasionally."

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.633
SAM: Oh.

00:24:46.633 --> 00:24:48.492
LAURA: Have you seen him lately?

00:24:48.492 --> 00:24:50.803
MATT: "N-not in a few days, no."

00:24:50.803 --> 00:24:52.994
LAURA: Do you know where he went?

00:24:52.994 --> 00:24:56.017
MATT: "Don't pay attention, don't care none."

00:24:56.017 --> 00:25:03.079
TRAVIS: Do you frequent spots outside of this
particular establishment or is this your shithole

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:04.146
of choice?

00:25:06.626 --> 00:25:14.300
MATT: You see him getting guarded the more you
start asking about Marius a little bit. Caduceus,

00:25:14.386 --> 00:25:21.670
you specifically, as you're watching this, you get
the sense that he's offered up a little bit of

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:28.268
information but that little bit seems to have
caused him to reel in. He's being guarded and

00:25:28.268 --> 00:25:33.980
doesn't seem very forthcoming, though he passes it
off as a lack of information.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:40.433
TALIESIN: I apologize if we're anxious. We just
want to get our business concluded as quickly as

00:25:40.433 --> 00:25:48.549
possible and move on to more pressing matters. I
mean, if you see Marius or know that he's around,

00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:54.634
you're welcome to tell him that people are trying
to deliver something. I get the impression that

00:25:54.634 --> 00:25:58.979
he's a friend and I also get the impression that
he's probably used to a fair bit of trouble and

00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:00.783
we're hoping not to be trouble.

00:26:00.783 --> 00:26:04.672
MATT: "You said something about a delivery?"

00:26:04.672 --> 00:26:09.954
TALIESIN: Well it's complicated, I'm not even
going to pretend that I entirely understand it

00:26:09.954 --> 00:26:11.490
myself. We're--

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.234
LAURA: It's a present. It was a present for him.

00:26:15.234 --> 00:26:21.931
MATT: There's a shifting to Orly at which point
the last of the air in the small pouch gets pushed

00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:25.645
in and it (wailing bagpipes) slowly comes to
rest.

00:26:25.645 --> 00:26:28.598
TALIESIN: Again I hate to ask personal questions
but--

00:26:28.598 --> 00:26:29.657
LIAM: (makes farting sound with chair)

00:26:29.657 --> 00:26:33.967
(laughter)

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:39.511
TALIESIN: Bastard. Have you ever sailed with
Marius by any chance? I mean, do you have an

00:26:39.511 --> 00:26:41.526
impression of him as a sailor or--?

00:26:41.526 --> 00:26:54.717
MATT: "(laughs) M-M-Marius ain't really what you'd
call sea-trekking folk. More of a slimy, shadow

00:26:54.717 --> 00:27:07.843
"word peddler. However, last time I saw him not but
maybe a week ago, I recall he was complaining.

00:27:07.843 --> 00:27:16.579
"Waiting on something to be delivered. Never found
its way around. Was getting real-- that boy owes a

00:27:16.579 --> 00:27:17.916
"lot of money."

00:27:17.916 --> 00:27:24.781
TALIESIN: I'll have to say that we might be the
answer he's looking for. We're removed from the

00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:31.035
actual situation. We're more delivery by
happenstance more than anything else. We have our

00:27:31.035 --> 00:27:35.958
own questions and problems and concerns which can
only be answered by someone who has a better grasp

00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:37.693
of the situation.

00:27:37.693 --> 00:27:39.956
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:27:39.956 --> 00:27:42.943
TRAVIS: Fucking talking cow over here. It was
great.

00:27:42.964 --> 00:27:45.932
TALIESIN: I know people. And turtles.

00:27:45.932 --> 00:27:46.963
LAURA: Ooh!

00:27:46.963 --> 00:27:48.835
TALIESIN: Wow. Persuasion?

00:27:48.835 --> 00:27:49.653
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:49.653 --> 00:27:50.995
TALIESIN: 21.

00:27:50.995 --> 00:27:59.414
MATT: 21? Orly looks you straight with his one
good eye, glances up and down. You get a good

00:27:59.414 --> 00:28:05.299
look. The leather eye patch itself has its own
carving into it like it was wettened at one point

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:11.254
and then shaved to have a very similar pattern as
the curling wave tattoos that match his upper arms

00:28:11.254 --> 00:28:16.242
and you can now see the backs and sides of his
neck. Looking through you for a moment, goes--

00:28:16.242 --> 00:28:18.837
TALIESIN: Sipping my milk. Milk mustache.

00:28:18.837 --> 00:28:21.281
(laughter)

00:28:21.281 --> 00:28:26.897
MATT: "Let me tell you something. If what you say
is true, it could very well be that you and your

00:28:26.897 --> 00:28:38.756
"friends here might have a way of taking some of
the weight off of M-M-Marius. I haven't seen him

00:28:38.756 --> 00:28:47.637
"in some time, but I do know sometimes he hangs
around the docks at night. Round m-m-midnight.

00:28:47.637 --> 00:28:55.008
"Sometimes he's meeting folks in ships and selling
things I can only imagine is illegal. Sometimes

00:28:55.008 --> 00:28:56.754
"he's picking things up."

00:28:56.754 --> 00:29:02.150
TALIESIN: You wouldn't mind me asking for a brief
description of him so we can identify him when we

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.192
see him? That would be most advantageous.

00:29:05.192 --> 00:29:14.286
MATT: "What you looking for: skinny-ass little
half-elf fellow. Sides of his head shaved real low.

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:15.892
"Tiny little fuzz.

00:29:15.892 --> 00:29:17.212
TALIESIN: Super cool.

00:29:17.212 --> 00:29:22.230
MATT: "With a big old flop of blonde hair, hangs
around in front of the face."

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.959
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool.

00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:33.862
MATT: "Other than that, he don't dress m-m-mighty
rich or anything. Tends to stay out of sight, so

00:29:33.862 --> 00:29:37.864
"maybe be best you keep a keen eye around the
shadows, huh?"

00:29:37.864 --> 00:29:42.233
TALIESIN: Sure. I imagine he's probably a little
jumpy of people if he owes money and that sort of

00:29:42.233 --> 00:29:50.263
thing. That can make someone very mistrusting. I
would hate to invoke your name in front of him, but--

00:29:50.263 --> 00:29:57.393
MATT: "If all goes well and you end up doing him a
solid, don't be afraid to tell him that Orly put

00:29:57.393 --> 00:29:59.561
you in the right direction, huh?"

00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:01.415
TALIESIN: Thanks, friend, that's great.

00:30:01.415 --> 00:30:03.943
MATT: "If not, don't say a fucking word."

00:30:03.943 --> 00:30:05.468
TALIESIN: Oh, of course not.

00:30:05.468 --> 00:30:09.258
SAM: (exaggerated Cajun accent) We'll be very
careful. We guarantee.

00:30:09.258 --> 00:30:13.278
(laughter)

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.367
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:17.137
MATT: Scratches the bottom of the chin, looking at
you.

00:30:17.137 --> 00:30:23.125
TRAVIS: This tortle must survive at all costs. Are
we in agreement?

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:25.996
LIAM: Tell us a story, Orly.

00:30:25.996 --> 00:30:33.225
TRAVIS: The other folks in the tavern-- there are
only five? Four or five?

00:30:33.225 --> 00:30:34.501
LAURA: There's the woman.

00:30:34.501 --> 00:30:36.567
SAM: There's the white-haired lady.

00:30:36.567 --> 00:30:38.351
MARISHA: Crotchety half-elf bartender

00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:39.784
SAM: The thick elf, yeah.

00:30:39.784 --> 00:30:43.180
MARISHA: And the other fisherman person?

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.053
MATT: Yeah, there's an older fisherman-looking
gentleman who's sitting there, minding his own

00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:48.822
business, staring at his own drink, though now
he's glaring over this large group that's

00:30:48.822 --> 00:30:55.177
conversing after blowing bagpipes in the middle of
his previously solitary afternoon. There's a

00:30:55.177 --> 00:31:05.892
woman, probably late 40s, early 50s or so, with a
very big mass of hair that goes from a dark brown,

00:31:05.892 --> 00:31:14.853
to a gray, to white at the tips, almost like a
mane. Dark skin, looks weathered from lots of

00:31:14.853 --> 00:31:22.341
travel and probably seen quite a bit in her day. A
light brown coat that hangs over the edge of the

00:31:22.341 --> 00:31:27.303
chair she's sitting in. They're all looking at you
guys because you all come storming in here, cause

00:31:27.303 --> 00:31:29.300
this ruckus, talking to the tortle.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.166
LAURA: I have a dog that's peeing on shit.

00:31:31.166 --> 00:31:34.531
MATT: Yeah, you guys aren't the most subtle of
arrivals.

00:31:34.531 --> 00:31:40.571
TRAVIS: Is she giving us a quizzical look, a
suspicious look, an interested look?

00:31:40.571 --> 00:31:43.658
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:31:43.658 --> 00:31:50.303
TRAVIS: That sucks balls. Four.

00:31:50.303 --> 00:31:51.148
MATT: Hard to tell.

00:31:51.148 --> 00:31:55.443
TRAVIS: Yep. Don't know if I care. I'm going to go
over to her.

00:31:55.443 --> 00:32:00.392
MATT: Do you guys stay with Orly, or--?

00:32:00.392 --> 00:32:04.879
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, is Orly giving the vibe
that he is enjoying the company or giving the vibe

00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:06.885
that he now wants to enjoy his drink in peace?

00:32:06.885 --> 00:32:10.375
MATT: He looks like he is enjoying his drink and
he's not giving you any particular vibe in your

00:32:10.375 --> 00:32:16.112
direction. He doesn't seem to mind, but he's not
engaging. Most of his conversation is reactive at

00:32:16.112 --> 00:32:17.378
the moment.

00:32:17.378 --> 00:32:21.663
TALIESIN: Well, we got one more problem we got to
deal with, which is your mom's problem.

00:32:21.663 --> 00:32:22.577
SAM: Yeah.

00:32:22.577 --> 00:32:27.041
TALIESIN: And that's the one where we're going to
maybe have to get a little difficult.

00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:35.720
SAM: To refresh everyone else's memory, because my
memory is sound, we're looking for a way to get

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.144
down into the underbelly of the city, right?

00:32:40.144 --> 00:32:45.230
ALL: The Sluice Weave.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.653
LIAM: It's just called the Sluice.

00:32:46.653 --> 00:32:48.190
SAM: Oh yeah, that's right.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.379
TRAVIS: That's where the guy that's causing the
problem is, but it seems super complicated.

00:32:52.379 --> 00:32:55.303
SAM: We got to find out some info.

00:32:55.303 --> 00:32:58.073
TALIESIN: Yeah. Do you know anyone who knows how
to get down to the Sluice Weave, or has ever been

00:32:58.073 --> 00:33:00.000
there, by any chance?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.201
MATT: "What are you talking about?"

00:33:02.201 --> 00:33:06.048
TALIESIN: I don't actually know what I'm talking
about, to be fair.

00:33:06.048 --> 00:33:13.334
MATT: "I don't either, my apologies. I don't
know."

00:33:13.334 --> 00:33:15.112
LAURA: Insight?

00:33:15.112 --> 00:33:16.706
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:33:16.706 --> 00:33:19.633
SAM: Use those blue dice, those blue dice!

00:33:19.633 --> 00:33:20.885
LAURA: Oh.

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:22.719
SAM: I touched them all.

00:33:22.719 --> 00:33:25.562
LAURA: You did. That's a natural one!

00:33:29.562 --> 00:33:39.839
MATT: He's smiling with his response, and in all
your time, you're not very well versed in the tics

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:45.481
and the subtle facial reads for tortles.

00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:53.723
TALIESIN: (whispering) I like tortles. Yeah, we've
got somebody who's a bit of a problem we have to

00:33:53.723 --> 00:33:56.499
deal with as well. This is a completely separate
issue.

00:33:56.499 --> 00:34:02.259
MATT: "Oh, that's fine. There are all sorts of
problems throughout this city. You end up taking

00:34:02.259 --> 00:34:07.664
"one down, that's one m-m-more that we don't got to
piss on."

00:34:07.664 --> 00:34:10.327
TALIESIN: It's somebody being impolite to a friend
of ours.

00:34:10.327 --> 00:34:11.897
LAURA: My mom.

00:34:11.897 --> 00:34:19.811
MATT: "Well, that just ain't going to stand now,
is it, <i>cherie?</i> You got to respect people's m-m-mamas."

00:34:19.885 --> 00:34:21.022
TALIESIN: So true.

00:34:21.022 --> 00:34:22.032
LAURA: Yep.

00:34:22.032 --> 00:34:23.913
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:34:23.913 --> 00:34:27.344
MATT: While you're having this conversation, Fjord
has walked over to the other table and the woman

00:34:27.485 --> 00:34:29.707
sitting there, her hands resting on the side.

00:34:29.707 --> 00:34:30.768
LIAM: I'm trailing him.

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:31.556
MATT: Trailing as well?

00:34:31.556 --> 00:34:32.783
LIAM: Yep, trailing.

00:34:32.783 --> 00:34:35.786
MATT: As you guys approach, with Fjord towards the
front, she watches you.

00:34:35.786 --> 00:34:38.811
TRAVIS: Couldn't help but notice we seemed to have
caught your eye.

00:34:38.811 --> 00:34:46.514
MATT: "Well, I'm going to be honest. It's hard not
to draw my attention with that very subtle display

00:34:46.514 --> 00:34:48.796
you've all managed to provide."

00:34:48.796 --> 00:34:55.927
TRAVIS: I apologize. Clearly my friends and I are
new in town, and we are very inquisitive. What is

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.782
that you're drinking?

00:34:57.782 --> 00:35:00.074
MATT: "This here? Wine."

00:35:00.687 --> 00:35:05.244
TRAVIS: (whispering) Am I slipping? I can't help
it! I can't not do it!

00:35:05.244 --> 00:35:07.361
MARISHA: It's so dapper in here!

00:35:07.361 --> 00:35:11.202
MATT: "It's wine. Red. Why, you buying?"

00:35:11.202 --> 00:35:13.022
TRAVIS: Yeah, would you care for more?

00:35:13.022 --> 00:35:15.368
MATT: "(chuckle) I'll always care for more."

00:35:15.368 --> 00:35:18.920
TRAVIS: I'll wave to the barkeep to bring another
round over.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.156
MATT: For just her or for both of you?

00:35:21.156 --> 00:35:22.148
TRAVIS: For her.

00:35:22.148 --> 00:35:26.277
MATT: Okay. That'll put you back, we'll say--

00:35:26.277 --> 00:35:28.231
SAM: 200 gold.

00:35:28.231 --> 00:35:29.642
TRAVIS: Most expensive wine.

00:35:29.642 --> 00:35:33.822
MATT: No, we'll say one silver for just her, for
one round.

00:35:33.822 --> 00:35:40.825
TRAVIS: If you wouldn't mind, we were moving
through the town, and there is this tower right in

00:35:41.136 --> 00:35:49.811
the middle of it. The Tide Peak, I believe it's
called in my notes. Can you tell me, do you know

00:35:49.811 --> 00:35:52.483
anything about that? Such a strange structure.

00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:58.478
MATT: "To be completely honest, I don't spend a
lot of time in the Quay. I tend to focus more on

00:35:58.478 --> 00:36:02.487
"this side. The business is better." I don't know
why I'm focused on that other eye. I'm stuck in

00:36:02.487 --> 00:36:08.284
that. I just noticed that. No, it's good. She was
leaning this way.

00:36:08.284 --> 00:36:10.684
TALIESIN: You've had your Creole.

00:36:10.684 --> 00:36:19.876
MATT: I know, and it's a problem already. She
goes, "I've seen it. I've certainly gazed and seen

00:36:19.876 --> 00:36:22.278
"that weird tower. I think that's what you're
referring to."

00:36:22.278 --> 00:36:22.860
TRAVIS: Indeed.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.580
LIAM: Do you live in these parts, or are you just
passing through?

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.606
MATT: "Oh no, just passing through. Taking a
break. I've only been here for about a week, and

00:36:28.606 --> 00:36:32.345
"then shoving off back to this trade route towards
Marquet, probably."

00:36:32.345 --> 00:36:34.185
TRAVIS: Oh, a fellow sailor.

00:36:34.185 --> 00:36:36.354
MATT: "You a sailor as well?"

00:36:36.354 --> 00:36:41.088
TRAVIS: Indeed. Not for some time, I'm a bit out
of practice, but yeah.

00:36:41.088 --> 00:36:43.967
MATT: "What's your specialty? I might be looking
for crew."

00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:49.946
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm quite a strong back. Good with
rigging, topsail. You name it, I've done it.

00:36:49.946 --> 00:36:53.262
MATT: "What's your rank?"

00:36:53.262 --> 00:37:01.398
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't quite make it up past making
the crew. I'm afraid higher duty didn't quite suit me.

00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:03.572
MATT: "But you're looking to travel?"

00:37:03.572 --> 00:37:07.820
TRAVIS: Could be. Do you have work?

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:12.465
MATT: "I maybe got room for one more in the crew
if you want to come along. Prove yourself a few

00:37:12.465 --> 00:37:13.851
days at sea."

00:37:13.851 --> 00:37:17.473
TRAVIS: I might stop by. Where is your ship?

00:37:17.473 --> 00:37:23.815
MATT: She glances off to the side and points on
the far left side of the harbor. "I can't really

00:37:23.815 --> 00:37:29.906
"show you from here. Follow me." She steps up and
walks past you towards the front and points to one

00:37:29.906 --> 00:37:39.532
ship. "Past there, the one with the grayish sails
furled up. That's the Drensala Vis. That's my ship."

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.446
TRAVIS: Drensala Vis. Your ship? Beautiful.

00:37:44.446 --> 00:37:49.487
MATT: "She's been through a lot, but she's stuck
with me for many years."

00:37:49.487 --> 00:37:52.246
LIAM: Apologies, did we catch your name?

00:37:52.246 --> 00:37:54.224
MATT: "I didn't catch yours."

00:37:54.224 --> 00:37:56.607
LIAM: Oh, my name is Caleb Widogast.

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.455
MATT: "Who is this guy?"

00:37:58.455 --> 00:38:00.568
LIAM: Caleb Widogast, and this is my friend
Fjord.

00:38:00.568 --> 00:38:01.829
MATT: "This your friend?"

00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:05.628
TRAVIS: This is my accountant, Caleb Widogast.
Very intelligent, good with books and numbers.

00:38:05.628 --> 00:38:12.696
MATT: "I've got to say, I'm pretty intrigued by a
strong-backed, small-ranked sailor looking for

00:38:12.696 --> 00:38:14.984
"work that walks around with his own accountant."

00:38:14.984 --> 00:38:20.861
LIAM: Well. not specifically to Fjord, but to our
group. We are an odd bunch, a collection of

00:38:20.861 --> 00:38:24.222
people, so you know, we tend to get our noses in
things.

00:38:24.222 --> 00:38:28.103
TRAVIS: You know how valuable it is to be a jack
of all trades. I've tried some things in the

00:38:28.103 --> 00:38:29.770
meantime while I've been landlocked.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:34.365
LIAM: When we need to be at sea, we have Fjord.
When we need to crunch numbers, we have me, and we

00:38:34.365 --> 00:38:36.022
have others as well.

00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:37.817
MATT: "Caleb Widogast."

00:38:37.817 --> 00:38:38.749
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:39.970
TRAVIS: Fjord.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.181
MATT: "Fjord. Just Fjord?"

00:38:41.181 --> 00:38:41.930
TRAVIS: Just Fjord.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.018
MATT: "Well, I'm just Captain Adella. Pleasure to
meet you."

00:38:45.018 --> 00:38:51.172
TRAVIS: The pleasure is all ours. When are you
planning to cast off?

00:38:51.917 --> 00:38:59.252
MATT: "I think when we round up with a full crew
and supplies gathered up. Probably want to take

00:38:59.252 --> 00:39:04.563
"some time to relax here in town for another week
or so and then we'll head off. It's probably going

00:39:04.563 --> 00:39:09.952
"to be a good six, seven months' journey before we
come back. But if you and your accountant friend

00:39:09.952 --> 00:39:12.062
"are looking to come, we got room for two more."

00:39:12.062 --> 00:39:18.199
LIAM: Two only? Do you have room for-- well, it's
just six right now.

00:39:21.169 --> 00:39:24.366
MATT: "If you want to pay passage."

00:39:24.366 --> 00:39:28.559
LIAM: This is certainly possible. You are heading
back to Marquet, you say?

00:39:28.812 --> 00:39:33.660
MATT: "Yeah, direct. Couple stops along the coast,
but--"

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.597
LIAM: We'll keep it in mind.

00:39:35.597 --> 00:39:36.936
MATT: "Very well."

00:39:36.936 --> 00:39:38.336
TRAVIS: It was nice meeting you.

00:39:38.336 --> 00:39:39.072
MATT: "You as well."

00:39:39.072 --> 00:39:43.581
LIAM: Oh also, I'm sorry, if I could round back
for a moment to that tower. I know you don't know

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:48.793
much, but it sounds like you've been here longer
than we have. Have you heard anything about it?

00:39:48.793 --> 00:39:49.982
It's so odd.

00:39:49.982 --> 00:39:57.174
MATT: "That's about as much as I've heard. I tend
not to poke around places that act weird, strange

00:39:57.174 --> 00:40:01.535
"magics and such. Lot of folks that get too curious
end up not coming back."

00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:02.379
LIAM: Agreed.

00:40:02.379 --> 00:40:06.790
MARISHA: (whispering) --that badass, hot captain.
And now she's older! She's got the salt and pepper hair!

00:40:06.797 --> 00:40:09.133
(laughter)

00:40:09.133 --> 00:40:15.529
TALIESIN: I was waiting for a fluorescent light to
turn on. No, it was good, you were engaged.

00:40:15.529 --> 00:40:23.214
MARISHA: Wasn't she the one that I asked if she
was a pirate, right? She was like, "The fuck?"

00:40:23.214 --> 00:40:24.973
LIAM: Yeah, we sailed with her. Vox Machina sailed
with her.

00:40:24.973 --> 00:40:30.793
TRAVIS: Just curious, you don't happen to have any
members of your crew by the name of Sabian, do you?

00:40:30.811 --> 00:40:34.423
MATT: She goes, "Not in my crew."

00:40:34.423 --> 00:40:36.521
TRAVIS: The name sound familiar?

00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:42.797
MATT: "Yeah, half-elf fella? Yeah, he was in here
a few months back when I was last docked in

00:40:42.797 --> 00:40:48.736
Nicodranas. Working with that lowlife, Cadmus.
Haven't seen him since, though.".

00:40:48.736 --> 00:40:50.194
TRAVIS: Cadmus, you said?

00:40:50.194 --> 00:40:52.916
MATT: "Cadmus Leeland. You know Cadmus Leeland?"

00:40:52.916 --> 00:40:54.504
TRAVIS: The name rings a bell.

00:40:54.504 --> 00:40:57.116
MATT: "He's a right fuckface, I'll tell you
that."

00:40:57.116 --> 00:40:59.117
TRAVIS: A few months, you say?

00:40:59.117 --> 00:41:00.146
MATT: "Yeah."

00:41:00.146 --> 00:41:02.188
MARISHA: Capnis or Cadmus?

00:41:02.188 --> 00:41:03.376
MATT, LIAM, and SAM: Cadmus.

00:41:03.376 --> 00:41:05.270
TRAVIS: Does the name ring a bell?

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.151
MATT: Make a history check.

00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:08.437
LAURA: Why does it sound familiar?

00:41:08.437 --> 00:41:09.671
MARISHA: It does sound familiar.

00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:12.204
TRAVIS: Because it's a dope-ass name. Oh, that's
better. 18!

00:41:12.204 --> 00:41:24.127
MATT: You have heard of Cadmus. Cadmus goes under
the guise of a shipping merchant that hops from

00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:31.655
port to port, but for those who work heavily in
the shipping lanes, he's known to be a thief, one

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:41.482
that skims off the top. Recently, his business has
come to a crawl as he's instead been staying out

00:41:41.482 --> 00:41:49.227
to sea, possibly, from what rumors have said, been
involved in the shaking down of ships without

00:41:49.227 --> 00:41:51.266
means of protecting themselves.

00:41:51.266 --> 00:41:52.982
TRAVIS: Motherfucking pirates

00:41:52.982 --> 00:41:55.491
MARISHA: He's a pirate. Fucking pirates!

00:41:55.491 --> 00:42:00.437
MATT: You also, with that roll, you know the name
of his ship: The Widow's Embrace.

00:42:00.437 --> 00:42:02.314
TRAVIS: The Widow's Embrace

00:42:02.314 --> 00:42:03.514
MARISHA: That also sounds familiar.

00:42:03.514 --> 00:42:05.041
LAURA: How do we know that?

00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:06.747
TRAVIS: Because it's another good name.

00:42:06.747 --> 00:42:08.961
LAURA: Caleb, do you have a memory of this?

00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:12.299
LIAM: Yeah, have I ever heard of this boat in all
my readings?

00:42:12.299 --> 00:42:17.088
MATT: Not in your readings, no. You haven't spent
a lot of time studying maritime history.

00:42:17.088 --> 00:42:21.819
LAURA: Why is it so familiar?! (whispering)
Widow's Embrace, Widow's Embrace, Widow's Embrace.

00:42:21.933 --> 00:42:24.500
MARISHA: Was this recently? When would I have
written--

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.461
TRAVIS: Have we heard this name before?

00:42:26.461 --> 00:42:27.556
MATT: I don't think you have.

00:42:27.556 --> 00:42:28.397
LAURA: Really?

00:42:28.397 --> 00:42:32.809
TRAVIS: Just a good name. Fuck. Damn you and your
good name and character creation. Slow it down,

00:42:32.809 --> 00:42:37.926
man. Fucking us up over here. Giving us alternate
dimensions and shit.

00:42:37.926 --> 00:42:40.435
MATT: "Why, what's this Sabian to you?"

00:42:40.435 --> 00:42:45.490
TRAVIS: An old friend of mine. I owe him some
money. If you happen to see him, let him know that

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:49.039
Fjord was looking for him.

00:42:49.039 --> 00:42:54.806
MATT: "All right, but I'd do my best to stay away
from Cadmus. The guy's a right asshole. If your

00:42:54.965 --> 00:43:01.911
"friend's palling around with him, I don't know
what kind of shit your friend's getting into these days."

00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:07.789
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sure it's nothing too savory. He's
had terrible judgement in the past.

00:43:07.789 --> 00:43:16.198
MATT: At this point, Captain Adella looks over
your shoulder a bit and goes, "Anyway, I'm going

00:43:16.198 --> 00:43:18.594
"to go finish my wine. It's been a pleasure."

00:43:18.594 --> 00:43:21.079
TRAVIS: I'll turn over my shoulder.

00:43:22.127 --> 00:43:28.751
MATT: You guys have moved back into the bar, and
in the doorway, you see a figure appear. A looming

00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:34.239
figure. There's the dark silhouette against the
bright sun in the sky behind. You see over one

00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:40.378
shoulder, some sort of large sack that has been
thrown over and held with one arm. The other sits

00:43:40.378 --> 00:43:47.929
at the side with a sword sheathed across that
shoulder. Stepping into the light, you see the

00:43:47.929 --> 00:43:54.471
familiar and somewhat surprised face of Yasha.
Ashley, if you want to jump in here, if you don't mind?

00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:59.488
ALL: (cheering)

00:43:59.488 --> 00:44:00.418
ASHLEY: Surprise!

00:44:00.418 --> 00:44:01.681
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:05.597
SAM: Cue heavy metal music!

00:44:05.597 --> 00:44:10.240
ALL: (mimicking heavy metal music)

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.114
MARISHA: Where did those flash pots come from?

00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:14.739
TRAVIS: (cheering)

00:44:16.364 --> 00:44:17.575
ASHLEY: Oh hi!

00:44:17.575 --> 00:44:20.454
ALL: HI!

00:44:20.454 --> 00:44:23.483
LIAM: Completion! The full set!

00:44:23.483 --> 00:44:27.068
TRAVIS: Yeah! Revoke your travel status! Never
leave again! Okay, cool.

00:44:27.068 --> 00:44:28.944
MARISHA: Oh my god, I know. Hi!

00:44:28.944 --> 00:44:31.238
ASHLEY: Hi!

00:44:31.238 --> 00:44:39.403
MATT: You guys spin around to see the broad
shoulders and intimidating presence of Yasha step

00:44:39.403 --> 00:44:44.963
into the dark bar interior. Yasha, you step inside
looking for a moment of respite and a drink and

00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:49.529
are caught off guard by the group that is now
staring back at you with the same aghast expression.

00:44:49.529 --> 00:44:51.021
ASHLEY: Oh, fuck.

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.232
LAURA: Oh, fuck!

00:44:52.232 --> 00:44:54.137
TALIESIN: Hey.

00:44:54.137 --> 00:44:54.883
ASHLEY: Hey.

00:44:54.883 --> 00:44:57.343
SAM: I'll run over and give her a big hug on her
knees!

00:44:57.343 --> 00:45:01.186
ASHLEY: Oh, hello everyone.

00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:04.780
LIAM: What are the odds? Pretty slim.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.528
ASHLEY: What are the odds?

00:45:06.528 --> 00:45:12.300
MARISHA: I feel like we should talk. Let's get
this back corner booth.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.527
LAURA: What are you doing here?

00:45:15.527 --> 00:45:19.587
ASHLEY: I'm just passing through here.

00:45:19.587 --> 00:45:23.619
LAURA: Did you know we were here? Did you get our
message? Did you get my messages?

00:45:23.619 --> 00:45:25.465
ASHLEY: No. You sent messages?

00:45:25.465 --> 00:45:27.305
LAURA: I sent you lots of messages, Yasha.

00:45:27.305 --> 00:45:29.349
ASHLEY: What did they say?

00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:31.999
LAURA: Well, they said that we were--

00:45:31.999 --> 00:45:33.954
TRAVIS: You can summarize it; it'd be fine.

00:45:33.954 --> 00:45:39.536
LAURA: They mostly said that I missed you and that
we were going to Nicodranas and we were heading

00:45:39.861 --> 00:45:47.357
over to find out more stuff about-- I don't remember
what we're even doing here in Nicodranas anymore.

00:45:47.357 --> 00:45:51.104
SAM: We're here for Fjord and also for you.

00:45:51.104 --> 00:45:56.227
LAURA: We're here for Fjord and we're finding out
stuff about him and also we saw my mom.

00:45:56.227 --> 00:45:58.117
MARISHA: Also, we've never seen the ocean.

00:45:58.117 --> 00:46:00.996
ASHLEY: Yeah, I've never seen the ocean either,
but--

00:46:00.996 --> 00:46:03.967
LAURA: Did you see it now? Because we're here in
the city. It's right over there.

00:46:03.967 --> 00:46:06.934
ASHLEY: I just got here a bit ago. I've been--

00:46:09.164 --> 00:46:10.490
MARISHA: Are you okay?

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.539
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.718
LIAM: What are you doing here?

00:46:17.718 --> 00:46:25.006
ASHLEY: I am trying to get in the water. I need to
go somewhere.

00:46:25.006 --> 00:46:26.670
TRAVIS: In the water?

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:31.470
ASHLEY: I'm trying to find passage to go
somewhere.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.226
LAURA: Go somewhere where?

00:46:33.226 --> 00:46:37.276
ASHLEY: (sighs)

00:46:37.276 --> 00:46:39.777
TRAVIS: You don't have to tell us.

00:46:39.777 --> 00:46:46.192
SAM: No, she has to tell us. Where're you going
now? You just got here. We haven't even said hello!

00:46:46.878 --> 00:46:55.949
ASHLEY: Yeah. I've been on a journey and I have
somewhere to go. At least, I think that I need to go.

00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:58.062
LIAM: Immediately? You need to get on a boat?

00:46:58.062 --> 00:46:59.985
ASHLEY: Not immediately.

00:46:59.985 --> 00:47:01.407
LIAM: Today, tomorrow, or--?

00:47:01.407 --> 00:47:03.204
ASHLEY: We can have a drink or two.

00:47:03.204 --> 00:47:05.812
LIAM: Could we get a couple bottles of wine over
here, please?

00:47:05.812 --> 00:47:11.517
MATT: The bartender goes and gathers a couple
bottles of wine. That'll run you-- fair or fine wine?

00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:13.416
LIAM: Fine wine.

00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:16.019
MATT: That'll be, for two bottles, 20 gold.

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:20.920
LIAM: You know, I've changed my mind. The price on
that--

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.412
TRAVIS: He's getting the cork.

00:47:22.412 --> 00:47:24.566
LIAM: Give me the Two Buck Chuck, please.

00:47:24.566 --> 00:47:26.708
ASHLEY: PBR?

00:47:26.708 --> 00:47:34.924
MATT: For a passing, somewhat briny wine, run you
about two gold for two bottles.

00:47:34.924 --> 00:47:39.283
MARISHA: I'll buy. It's been a while.

00:47:39.283 --> 00:47:41.847
LIAM: For the basic bitch wine, correct?

00:47:41.847 --> 00:47:45.216
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm not going to pay for a nice
glass of wine for your ass.

00:47:45.216 --> 00:47:47.673
SAM: This is Yasha. You can't afford--

00:47:47.673 --> 00:47:50.828
ASHLEY: It's fine. I can't tell the difference.

00:47:50.828 --> 00:47:52.893
MARISHA: I was talking to Caleb. I'd buy a glass
of wine for you.

00:47:52.893 --> 00:47:54.388
ASHLEY: Thank you, Beau.

00:47:54.388 --> 00:47:59.371
TRAVIS: You may be in luck. We just met a captain
of a ship, not two minutes before you walked in.

00:47:59.371 --> 00:48:02.351
MARISHA: Yeah. Technically only has one spot on
her boat.

00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:05.722
SAM: She's going to Marquet. Is that where you're
going?

00:48:05.722 --> 00:48:08.494
ASHLEY: I don't exactly know where I'm going.

00:48:08.494 --> 00:48:11.876
SAM: That will be difficult to find.

00:48:11.876 --> 00:48:20.115
MARISHA: So you're on a journey of immediate
agency, and you're not sure where you're going,

00:48:20.115 --> 00:48:22.937
and you think you have to go, but you're not
sure?

00:48:22.937 --> 00:48:28.141
SAM: She might be under a spell or something, a
hypnosis spell. Hit her. Snap her out of it.

00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:29.703
ASHLEY: No, I just--

00:48:29.703 --> 00:48:35.206
LIAM: You're feeling a calling?

00:48:35.206 --> 00:48:38.403
ASHLEY: Yeah. I had dreams of a place that I need
to go to.

00:48:38.403 --> 00:48:40.108
LAURA: What's it look like?

00:48:40.108 --> 00:48:42.474
SAM: Maybe we've been there.

00:48:42.474 --> 00:48:43.870
ASHLEY: They're islands.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:48.786
LAURA: (gasps) My dad is from islands! At least he
was. Did you know my dad might be The Gentleman?

00:48:48.786 --> 00:48:51.307
ASHLEY: You mean--?

00:48:51.307 --> 00:48:52.678
TRAVIS: Yeah, that happened.

00:48:52.678 --> 00:48:54.482
SAM: The moist guy.

00:48:54.482 --> 00:48:56.307
ASHLEY: The guy that sweats all the time?

00:48:56.307 --> 00:48:57.911
TRAVIS: Has all our blood.

00:48:57.911 --> 00:49:00.213
LAURA: (whispering) That's why I'm blue!

00:49:00.213 --> 00:49:01.899
ASHLEY: Jester!

00:49:01.899 --> 00:49:02.743
LAURA: I know!

00:49:02.743 --> 00:49:05.299
LIAM: It's probable. It has not been verified.

00:49:05.299 --> 00:49:07.996
ASHLEY: So your mom's the Ruby of the Sea, and
then The Gentleman.

00:49:07.996 --> 00:49:10.684
LAURA: Potentially. I mean, it could've happened.

00:49:10.684 --> 00:49:14.267
ASHLEY: He's a pretty interesting man. I wish I
could've met your mother.

00:49:14.267 --> 00:49:21.816
LAURA: She's right here. You can meet her if you
want to. I told her all about you.

00:49:21.816 --> 00:49:22.655
ASHLEY: You did?

00:49:22.655 --> 00:49:27.559
MARISHA: We have to go punk some guy's ass who's
been harassing her. If you want to join us on

00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:30.902
kicking this guy's ass, and then we can report
back to her.

00:49:30.902 --> 00:49:32.757
TRAVIS: What's in the sack?

00:49:32.757 --> 00:49:34.608
ASHLEY: Just some stuff.

00:49:34.608 --> 00:49:37.938
MARISHA: Someone's head? Is it a body? It's a
body, isn't it?

00:49:37.938 --> 00:49:41.968
LAURA: Is it presents for us? Have you been
gathering presents for when you saw us again?

00:49:41.968 --> 00:49:45.327
SAM: Ooh, are you super-goth Santa or something?

00:49:45.327 --> 00:49:49.046
ASHLEY: Ho ho ho.

00:49:49.046 --> 00:49:53.920
(laughter)

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.834
MARISHA: We have so many questions.

00:49:55.834 --> 00:49:59.890
ASHLEY: Who's this guy that's been messing with
your mom?

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:04.943
LAURA: He's this really creepy guy who was trying
to get with her, and she's like, "I don't know,"

00:50:04.943 --> 00:50:09.106
and then he's like, "You're only going to be
mine!" She's like, "I don't like that," and now

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:11.611
he's threatening everybody else that wants to see
her.

00:50:11.611 --> 00:50:14.190
LIAM: Yeah, you know, your standard angry
creeper.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:19.196
ASHLEY: That sounds like someone whose ass I would
like to kick.

00:50:19.196 --> 00:50:20.704
LAURA: Yeah!

00:50:20.704 --> 00:50:26.482
MARISHA: His name's Algar? Algar Dyomin? Have you
heard of him?

00:50:26.482 --> 00:50:28.262
MATT: You have no idea who that is.

00:50:28.262 --> 00:50:30.006
ASHLEY: I have no idea who that is.

00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:31.745
MARISHA: But he has a douchebag sounding name,
right?

00:50:31.745 --> 00:50:39.561
ASHLEY: Yeah, that sounds-- I don't even remember
it. Algar? Al Gore?

00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:47.775
LIAM: Oh no. I'm still struck by the fact that you
have walked into this tavern where we are. It

00:50:47.775 --> 00:50:49.706
means something.

00:50:49.706 --> 00:50:51.062
LAURA: It's fate!

00:50:51.062 --> 00:50:53.035
LIAM: Is what I'm saying.

00:50:53.035 --> 00:50:54.640
LAURA: It's the Traveler.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:02.233
SAM: Or maybe it's the ball thing, the dodeca.
Maybe it brings us all together. Maybe it's

00:51:02.233 --> 00:51:03.881
special in some way?

00:51:03.881 --> 00:51:06.713
MARISHA: Sisterhood of the Traveling
Dodecahedron.

00:51:06.713 --> 00:51:08.137
TRAVIS: Gross.

00:51:08.137 --> 00:51:10.601
LAURA: Maybe.

00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:19.362
MARISHA: Seriously though, are you okay after
everything? We didn't really leave on the most

00:51:19.362 --> 00:51:21.557
positive of terms.

00:51:21.557 --> 00:51:36.514
ASHLEY: I'll be okay. I've had to work through
some things. Speaking of, it looks like you have a

00:51:36.514 --> 00:51:38.409
new member already in the group.

00:51:38.409 --> 00:51:41.264
MARISHA: Well, we're not replacing Molly.

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:43.408
LAURA: Or you.

00:51:43.408 --> 00:51:49.323
TALIESIN: We didn't really talk much last time.
You were in your own space.

00:51:49.805 --> 00:51:54.557
TRAVIS: We didn't really get to explain. You were
the last to wake up of the three of us, and by the

00:51:54.557 --> 00:52:01.703
time you came around, we had met Mr. Clay. He
apparently worked in a graveyard? Cemetery? I want

00:52:01.703 --> 00:52:02.959
to get it right.

00:52:02.959 --> 00:52:05.588
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> He was crucial in us getting the three
of you out.

00:52:05.588 --> 00:52:14.535
ASHLEY: Well, thank you. I'm sure we could've made
it if we had more time. But thank you for helping.

00:52:14.535 --> 00:52:16.425
TALIESIN: Well, here you are.

00:52:16.425 --> 00:52:18.117
ASHLEY: Yes, here I am.

00:52:18.117 --> 00:52:23.851
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps it's destiny. Do you
believe in destiny?

00:52:23.851 --> 00:52:26.569
ASHLEY: No.

00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:30.541
TALIESIN: But you dream about islands, and you go
to them.

00:52:30.541 --> 00:52:34.280
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking shit.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.865
SAM: He does this a lot, Yasha.

00:52:36.865 --> 00:52:38.254
ASHLEY: I don't know if I like you.

00:52:38.254 --> 00:52:39.526
TALIESIN: I know I like you.

00:52:39.526 --> 00:52:44.539
SAM: Go with it! Open up, and he'll read into your
inner thoughts. That's his power.

00:52:44.539 --> 00:52:46.999
MARISHA: You should try some of his dead tea. It's
pretty good.

00:52:46.999 --> 00:52:50.648
ASHLEY: Your dead tea? What is a dead tea?

00:52:50.648 --> 00:52:55.707
TRAVIS: He makes tea out of dead people. I know.
Like it sounds.

00:52:55.707 --> 00:53:02.772
ASHLEY: What is it? Does it taste good? I'm not
opposed to such things. I have a fine palate.

00:53:02.772 --> 00:53:06.217
TALIESIN: Let me see you eat a meal, then I'll
figure out what tea to give you.

00:53:06.217 --> 00:53:11.134
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay. Sounds like a plan.

00:53:11.134 --> 00:53:15.391
TRAVIS: How did the vision of these islands come
to you?

00:53:18.121 --> 00:53:34.317
ASHLEY: Well, they come in my dreams, as most of
my visions have. It's the way that I commune with

00:53:34.317 --> 00:53:46.198
the Stormlord, and-- I don't know. I'm trying to
find some purpose for all this, I guess.

00:53:46.198 --> 00:53:48.316
TRAVIS: The Stormlord?

00:53:48.316 --> 00:53:54.886
ASHLEY: No, I mean, the purpose of all--

00:53:54.886 --> 00:54:00.858
TRAVIS: You commune with the Stormlord? <i>The</i>
Stormlord?

00:54:00.858 --> 00:54:03.672
ASHLEY: At least, I think I am.

00:54:03.672 --> 00:54:08.689
TRAVIS: That's significant.

00:54:08.689 --> 00:54:13.430
MARISHA: I don't have any dreams at night, you
guys. Is that worrisome?

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:16.673
SAM: You probably do, but you just don't remember
them.

00:54:16.673 --> 00:54:17.929
MARISHA: Is that the deal?

00:54:17.929 --> 00:54:23.495
SAM: You can sleep with crystals to have a more
vivid experience when you dream.

00:54:23.495 --> 00:54:25.158
LAURA: Keep a dream journal.

00:54:25.158 --> 00:54:28.562
MARISHA: I don't think that's true. Oh, dream
journals I think are true.

00:54:28.562 --> 00:54:33.693
SAM: Tonight, when it looks like you're really
fast asleep, I'll wake you up and ask you what

00:54:33.693 --> 00:54:35.298
you're thinking about!

00:54:35.298 --> 00:54:37.116
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, deal.

00:54:37.116 --> 00:54:38.033
SAM: Great.

00:54:38.033 --> 00:54:43.124
TALIESIN: Well, I suppose if the Stormlord put you
on this path, then you're with us now because of

00:54:43.369 --> 00:54:51.532
some divine intervention. I think it's important
to follow one's feelings on such things. I commend you.

00:54:51.532 --> 00:54:53.382
ASHLEY: Well, thank you.

00:54:53.382 --> 00:54:54.388
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:54:54.388 --> 00:54:55.690
ASHLEY: What was your name again?

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:57.941
TALIESIN: Caduceus, Caduceus Clay. It's a
pleasure.

00:54:57.941 --> 00:55:01.393
ASHLEY: Caduceus Clay. That's a very interesting
name.

00:55:01.393 --> 00:55:05.113
TALIESIN: Thank you, they've been-- your friends
have spoken very highly of you in your absence.

00:55:05.113 --> 00:55:06.975
ASHLEY: That's very nice.

00:55:06.975 --> 00:55:09.710
TRAVIS: We have missed you; we don't mean to pry.

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:18.587
ASHLEY: No, I've missed you guys too, but,
sometimes it's just best to go my own way sometimes.

00:55:18.937 --> 00:55:23.258
MARISHA: I mean, by all reality, we barely know
each other.

00:55:23.258 --> 00:55:24.686
ASHLEY: It's true.

00:55:25.896 --> 00:55:32.504
LIAM: It is funny how you keep showing up though,
like a bad penny.

00:55:32.504 --> 00:55:37.823
ASHLEY: Isn't it weird?

00:55:37.823 --> 00:55:39.687
TALIESIN: I never understood that penny.

00:55:39.687 --> 00:55:40.674
LAURA: I have a weasel! Here.

00:55:40.674 --> 00:55:43.367
TALIESIN: Oh, no! Okay, that's-- oh, wow.

00:55:43.367 --> 00:55:44.683
LAURA: His name is Sprinkle.

00:55:44.683 --> 00:55:46.334
TALIESIN: Sorry, Sprinkle.

00:55:46.334 --> 00:55:49.238
ASHLEY: Where did you get-- whoa!

00:55:49.238 --> 00:55:52.782
TRAVIS: Interact with that fucking weasel.

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:59.204
MATT: You see this bright crimson weasel that is
now curled up in your hand and (chattering).

00:55:59.482 --> 00:56:01.396
LAURA: He's not trained yet. Don't lose him.

00:56:01.396 --> 00:56:02.385
SAM: Yet?

00:56:02.385 --> 00:56:04.259
MATT: It pisses right in your hand.

00:56:04.259 --> 00:56:09.219
ASHLEY: That's, uh, that's okay. This is
Sprinkle?

00:56:09.219 --> 00:56:10.076
LAURA: Mmm.

00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:13.184
ASHLEY: That's a very cute little thing. I don't
want to crush it.

00:56:13.184 --> 00:56:14.383
LAURA: There's a dog too.

00:56:14.383 --> 00:56:15.381
ASHLEY: There's a dog?

00:56:15.381 --> 00:56:17.881
LIAM: As soon as the animals come out, I go to
talk to the barkeep.

00:56:17.881 --> 00:56:21.222
MATT: As you say dog, you look down and you can
see the right side of your boot is now being

00:56:21.222 --> 00:56:28.758
slightly moistened by the urine of the tiny puppy.
All the animals are apparently marking you as

00:56:28.758 --> 00:56:36.666
their territory. But you see this tiny, light
brown puppy with big oversized paws and a couple

00:56:36.666 --> 00:56:44.082
of faint stripes across the fur, these pointy,
fey-featured elements, more angular than a softer

00:56:44.082 --> 00:56:47.770
puppy should, and these eyes look up at you
(panting).

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:53.208
ASHLEY: Aww. I do like dogs very much. This is
very cute. Who's this--

00:56:53.208 --> 00:56:54.525
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

00:56:54.525 --> 00:56:55.722
ASHLEY: What's his name?

00:56:55.722 --> 00:56:57.292
SAM, LAURA and MARISHA: Nugget.

00:56:57.292 --> 00:56:58.199
ASHLEY: Nugget.

00:56:58.199 --> 00:57:07.172
MARISHA: What if we teach Nugget to also be able
to bamf to Yasha while she's gone?

00:57:07.172 --> 00:57:09.256
LAURA: I know it's been a long time, but her name
is Yasha.

00:57:09.256 --> 00:57:15.679
MARISHA: It has been a long time, Yasha. Then
maybe Nugget can go back and forth between us when

00:57:15.679 --> 00:57:16.917
we're away.

00:57:16.917 --> 00:57:18.137
SAM: To Yasha?

00:57:18.137 --> 00:57:25.552
LAURA: Can he blink that far? I mean, when I
blink, I blink only ten feet. Believe me, I wanted

00:57:25.552 --> 00:57:27.836
to go farther, and I just kept blinking.

00:57:27.836 --> 00:57:31.465
LIAM: From the bar: it seems very doubtful. Excuse
me.

00:57:31.465 --> 00:57:32.975
MARISHA: But how cool would that be?

00:57:32.975 --> 00:57:38.951
MATT: The somewhat portly half-elf greets you as
you approach again. "All right, would you like

00:57:38.951 --> 00:57:40.305
"another drink?"

00:57:40.305 --> 00:57:43.764
LIAM: You know, I'm still working on the first
one, but I love your establishment--

00:57:43.764 --> 00:57:45.190
MATT: "Oh, why wait, it's good to have a backup,
right?"

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:48.050
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> I will take a backup, you are
correct.

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:49.413
MATT: "All right, very well."

00:57:49.413 --> 00:57:52.918
LIAM: While you're pouring, I had a question for
you. My friends and I, we have just rolled into

00:57:52.918 --> 00:58:00.557
town, and while we were walking through, we
noticed this very strange tower here. It's so

00:58:00.557 --> 00:58:02.227
bizarre, what is that place?

00:58:02.227 --> 00:58:08.167
MATT: "I'm sorry, what? The big blue tower over in
the Quay?"

00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:10.458
LIAM: That grows and shrinks when you walk toward
and away from it.

00:58:10.458 --> 00:58:11.281
TRAVIS: Tide Peak.

00:58:11.281 --> 00:58:15.285
LIAM: Don't know the name. Just being casual, you
know.

00:58:15.285 --> 00:58:18.036
MARISHA: I yell over, Oh now you're interested in
the tower!

00:58:18.036 --> 00:58:20.597
LIAM: I ignore her like usual.

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:25.780
MATT: "Yeah, I know of it, yeah. Why? Why do you
ask?"

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:31.903
LIAM: Well, it's just that it changed-- oh, thank
you-- it's just that it changed proportions the

00:58:31.903 --> 00:58:34.644
closer we got or further away from it, it didn't
seem natural.

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:38.158
MATT: "Yeah, it's got some weird sort of illusion
magic to it. It's creepy."

00:58:38.158 --> 00:58:39.866
LIAM: Whose is it?

00:58:39.866 --> 00:58:45.126
MATT: "Belongs to some mage. He's been here for a
while; named Yussa."

00:58:45.126 --> 00:58:49.692
LIAM: That's it, he's a mystery to the city, I
suppose?

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:53.316
MATT: "A mystery to me, I don't fucking go and
start climbing up towers to ask questions where

00:58:53.316 --> 00:58:54.269
"they don't belong."

00:58:54.269 --> 00:58:58.952
LIAM: You have to be a jackass to climb a tower
like that, it's just ripe full of danger.

00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:03.737
MARISHA: Stay on task, Widogast! Just quoting your
own advice.

00:59:05.477 --> 00:59:06.437
MATT: "That's, um--"

00:59:06.437 --> 00:59:09.172
LIAM: She's, you know, a crass idiot. Don't mind
her. But--

00:59:09.172 --> 00:59:10.817
MARISHA: (shouting) Can I get another wine?

00:59:13.677 --> 00:59:14.717
MATT: "Same or--?"

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:17.907
SAM: She's right next to you.

00:59:17.907 --> 00:59:22.618
LIAM: This close. Good job, asshole!

00:59:22.618 --> 00:59:26.573
MATT: He goes and prepares-- looking at this,
"Would you prefer a pitcher?"

00:59:26.573 --> 00:59:27.692
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:59:27.692 --> 00:59:30.579
LAURA: Beau, we need to get going. We need to find
Algar.

00:59:30.579 --> 00:59:34.808
TRAVIS: It's midday. This guy's like, "Fucking
money tourists."

00:59:34.808 --> 00:59:40.483
LIAM: Well, thank you for your time. He pours his
glass out on the ground out of the bartender's view.

00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:41.897
MARISHA: The fuck, what's wrong with you?

00:59:41.897 --> 00:59:43.967
LIAM: Subtle. Thank you very much for your time.

00:59:43.967 --> 00:59:46.322
MARISHA: (shouting) That was my shoe, asshole!

00:59:46.322 --> 00:59:48.537
LIAM: You're yelling at me from across the bar.

00:59:48.537 --> 00:59:50.976
MARISHA: You just established that I was next to
you.

00:59:50.976 --> 00:59:54.759
LIAM: Not in a German accent, Marisha.

00:59:54.759 --> 01:00:05.908
SAM: Everyone, please. Yasha has to catch an
express bus out of here, so we should probably get

01:00:05.908 --> 01:00:07.643
to ass-kicking.

01:00:07.643 --> 01:00:10.517
LAURA: I can't believe you didn't get my
messages!

01:00:10.517 --> 01:00:13.455
ASHLEY: Where did you send them to?

01:00:13.455 --> 01:00:15.309
LAURA: To your brain!

01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:19.756
SAM: Yeah, the magical messages. They should have
arrived. That doesn't make any sense, unless if

01:00:19.756 --> 01:00:22.401
you were under someone's spell?

01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:23.859
LIAM: Or sleeping, perhaps.

01:00:23.859 --> 01:00:27.575
LAURA: Well I guess I could have sent them while
you were sleeping, I guess.

01:00:27.575 --> 01:00:29.303
ASHLEY: Did I get any messages?

01:00:29.303 --> 01:00:37.330
MATT: Thinking back, you had received these words, but
not having a lot of experience with this type of

01:00:37.388 --> 01:00:46.361
spell contact before, you weren't sure if it was
you imagining things or having a slight nervous breakdown.

01:00:46.361 --> 01:01:00.428
ASHLEY: I did have times when I was walking, where
I heard your voice, but I didn't really hear

01:01:00.428 --> 01:01:07.971
words. It was more like (indiscernible babbling).
I didn't get any--

01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:12.601
LAURA: I need to be more specific with my
messages. You know, and I never got to say, "You

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:14.791
"can reply to this." That's an important part of
it.

01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:16.374
SAM: Well, that's four extra words.

01:01:16.374 --> 01:01:20.726
LIAM: Also, speaking from experience, sometimes
when you're very focused on a task, it can create

01:01:20.726 --> 01:01:23.006
a blind spot.

01:01:23.006 --> 01:01:24.991
LAURA: (sad trombone noise)

01:01:24.991 --> 01:01:26.719
TALIESIN: Is there something we can throw? Hold
on.

01:01:26.719 --> 01:01:29.799
LIAM: That's the worst shit that's ever been said
on this show.

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:31.572
SAM: Stay on task, Widogast!

01:01:31.572 --> 01:01:37.575
(laughter)

01:01:37.575 --> 01:01:40.566
LAURA: How do we find Al Gore-- Algar? Shit!

01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:42.600
MARISHA: How do we find Algar?

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.789
SAM: We have asked everyone in this bar about
everyone else in this town except for Al Gore. I

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:52.350
don't think that we have, no. We have not.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:55.194
MARISHA: We asked about the Sluice.

01:01:55.194 --> 01:02:00.830
SAM: The tower. We've asked about Sabian. We've
asked about Marquet. We've asked about the Marius

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:04.835
guy. We need to ask why we came here.

01:02:04.835 --> 01:02:11.365
MARISHA: We asked Orly about the Sluice, and he
said he didn't know.

01:02:11.365 --> 01:02:16.549
TRAVIS: Nott, why don't you get up on a table
and get everyone's attention and ask the room if

01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:18.226
they know anything about Algar?

01:02:18.226 --> 01:02:19.404
LAURA: Or the Sluice.

01:02:19.404 --> 01:02:21.860
MARISHA: I mean, they already know we're all
here.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:27.232
SAM: All right. I take a big swig of booze, stand
up on the table, take off my mask.

01:02:27.232 --> 01:02:31.000
TRAVIS: Everybody, your attention please! (claps)

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.236
MATT: Everyone curls over.

01:02:33.236 --> 01:02:35.434
SAM: (shouting) Everyone in the Wayfarer's Cove!

01:02:35.434 --> 01:02:40.879
TALIESIN: Is this a good place for Thaumaturgy?
Fuck it, let's accent this.

01:02:40.879 --> 01:02:47.439
SAM: You're surrounded by a band of goblins!
They're everywhere! And they'll come in here

01:02:47.439 --> 01:02:55.163
unless you tell me the location of Algar! Tell me
<i>now!</i> And I kick over a chair.

01:02:55.163 --> 01:03:00.899
MATT: The chair falls over.

01:03:00.899 --> 01:03:04.459
SAM: Two kicks.

01:03:04.459 --> 01:03:08.708
MATT: It finds its way to the ground. There's a
pause as everyone looks around.

01:03:08.708 --> 01:03:14.047
SAM: There's goblins everywhere! They're banging
at the windows!

01:03:14.047 --> 01:03:16.482
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to bang the windows!

01:03:16.482 --> 01:03:21.550
LIAM: This is totally the diner scene in Pulp
Fiction now.

01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:25.149
MARISHA: Maybe add his last name, Dyomin?

01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:27.415
TRAVIS: Every fucking last one of you!

01:03:27.415 --> 01:03:30.360
SAM: You might know him as Mr. Dyomin?

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.640
MATT: There's a continued pause as they all look
around.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.109
TALIESIN: Free round for anybody who has any
information.

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:44.668
MATT: Doing a pass across everybody in this room,
with a discerning eye, especially with your

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:50.605
Passive Insight, you get the sense that nobody
here really knows this Algar figure.

01:03:50.605 --> 01:03:53.682
TRAVIS: We've threatened them with goblin
tactics!

01:03:53.682 --> 01:04:03.613
SAM: That was, of course, a scene from the one-act
play that you can see later tonight.

01:04:03.613 --> 01:04:11.120
LAURA: Over at the fancy-- I forget the place that
I'm from. The fancy place.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.289
SAM: The Marquis Demesne.

01:04:13.306 --> 01:04:14.517
MATT: The Lavish Chateau.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.986
LAURA: The Lavish Chateau!

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:18.279
TRAVIS: I love that monologue.

01:04:18.279 --> 01:04:20.415
ASHLEY: Are you guys doing a play?

01:04:20.415 --> 01:04:29.892
MATT: Orly is clapping with his giant,
mitt-like, clawed tortle hands. "Not too bad!"

01:04:29.892 --> 01:04:35.520
(laughter)

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.864
LAURA: Let's get out of here and find the guy.
Also we have to remember: tonight.

01:04:39.864 --> 01:04:40.773
TRAVIS: Midnight.

01:04:40.773 --> 01:04:41.800
LAURA: Head to the docks.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.898
SAM: To talk to--

01:04:42.898 --> 01:04:43.917
LAURA: Marius.

01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:45.517
TRAVIS: LePual.

01:04:45.517 --> 01:04:50.597
SAM: First question to Marius: how do you
pronounce your last name?

01:04:50.597 --> 01:04:52.804
LAURA: Yeah. That's going to be a really important
one.

01:04:52.804 --> 01:04:59.055
MARISHA: Well, do we want to go by the Sluice
Weave? Or is that going to be way too shifty?

01:04:59.055 --> 01:05:02.185
LAURA: We can't just go to the Sluice Weave, it's
underwater.

01:05:02.185 --> 01:05:04.345
MARISHA: Yeah, but there are gates.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.132
LAURA: And they said we could get in trouble if we
go there uninvited.

01:05:08.132 --> 01:05:10.803
MARISHA: So how do we get invited?

01:05:10.803 --> 01:05:12.799
LAURA: This is true.

01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:17.263
TRAVIS: I mean, it couldn't hurt to do a
drive-by and just see if we could see anything.

01:05:17.263 --> 01:05:21.762
MARISHA: See what kind of paperwork? Or
identification?

01:05:21.762 --> 01:05:23.746
LAURA: I thought the gates were underwater?

01:05:23.746 --> 01:05:27.735
TRAVIS: I thought they were, too. I thought the
entrance was underwater.

01:05:27.735 --> 01:05:33.703
MATT: That's what you were told from the light
keeper at the lighthouse. She said as far as she

01:05:33.703 --> 01:05:42.010
knew the entrances that she knows of are beneath
the docks. Where the land falls off and meets the

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:45.083
ocean and the docks are out there, it's somewhere
underwater there.

01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.282
LAURA: Let's go and see if we can see something.

01:05:47.282 --> 01:05:49.387
MARISHA: But I mean do we swim?

01:05:49.387 --> 01:05:50.451
SAM: How?

01:05:50.451 --> 01:05:51.698
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:52.935
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, everybody can swim...

01:05:52.935 --> 01:06:01.215
SAM: Why don't we take a rowboat? And I'll just
stay above the surface and when you guys are

01:06:01.215 --> 01:06:03.806
ready, tug and I'll pull you up.

01:06:03.806 --> 01:06:06.702
TRAVIS: Are you strong enough to pull us up?

01:06:06.702 --> 01:06:08.493
SAM: Yasha will stay with me.

01:06:08.493 --> 01:06:11.297
LAURA: Yasha can swim, though.

01:06:11.297 --> 01:06:16.943
MARISHA: Yasha and I want to kick douchebag ass
together. It's been so long.

01:06:16.943 --> 01:06:18.088
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:06:18.088 --> 01:06:19.721
LAURA: I'll hold your hand underwater, Nott.

01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:23.997
ASHLEY: Do you want to ride on my back? I am a
very good swimmer.

01:06:23.997 --> 01:06:27.975
LIAM: That's true, you could piggyback.

01:06:27.975 --> 01:06:30.257
LAURA: Like a dolphin.

01:06:30.257 --> 01:06:34.380
SAM: I don't understand. We're just going to go
out into the harbor and start swimming blindly

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.393
looking for an underwater gate?

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:37.517
TRAVIS: Got to start somewhere.

01:06:37.517 --> 01:06:44.320
SAM: Why don't we send someone first, or at least
ask around before we just start swimming?

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.533
LIAM: Maybe ask a few more questions in a few
other places besides dive bars.

01:06:47.533 --> 01:06:51.276
MARISHA: I mean you can't live at the Sluice,
right? He's got to leave it at some point, right?

01:06:51.384 --> 01:06:55.794
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I mean at least if we're
heading towards the docks where the entrances are,

01:06:55.885 --> 01:06:57.483
I'm sure more people in that area will know--

01:06:57.483 --> 01:06:58.613
SAM: Let's go!

01:06:58.675 --> 01:07:00.132
LAURA: Let's go to the docks!

01:07:00.132 --> 01:07:03.423
MATT: All right. You're not that far away,
thankfully. You've been hanging around the

01:07:03.488 --> 01:07:10.037
Restless Wharf for a while, which is where the
tavern was. Striking out towards the edge and

01:07:10.037 --> 01:07:14.770
looking across the docks, there's one large ship
that came in and looks like a lot of stuff is

01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:20.603
being unloaded and is busy on that end. Not that
far off of it, the next dock that shoots out and

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:25.710
turns to the right, there looks like there's a couple of
anchored ships there. It's a little less busy,

01:07:25.776 --> 01:07:32.461
looks like they're currently moored there and not
a lot of folks are doing business on or around

01:07:32.461 --> 01:07:35.353
the ships, other than just keeping a watch on the docks
themselves.

01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:41.017
TRAVIS: Should I secure us a rowboat?

01:07:41.017 --> 01:07:44.791
TALIESIN: Is that something you can do?

01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:46.661
TRAVIS: Pretty sure I can.

01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:48.333
TALIESIN: Then yeah!

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:53.513
TRAVIS: Is there a ship shack, or something that
would lease vessels?

01:07:53.513 --> 01:07:55.858
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:07:55.858 --> 01:08:03.035
TRAVIS: It's an official term, guys. 13.

01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:11.048
MATT: You don't see anything in the way of a ship
shack right now. You do see a man. An older,

01:08:11.048 --> 01:08:20.117
grizzled fisherman of some kind, or at least a dock
worker. He has this long cap on that dangles past

01:08:20.117 --> 01:08:28.529
his mid-shoulders, in a heavy dark gray cloth
shirt that is drenched with sweat like he's been

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:35.999
doing hard work throughout most of the day. You see him
currently tying a small rowboat to the edge there

01:08:36.132 --> 01:08:37.529
and holding it in place.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:41.719
TRAVIS: Old timer! I'm sorry to bother you, I
don't see a mariner's office around here. Is that

01:08:41.719 --> 01:08:43.199
your rowboat?

01:08:43.199 --> 01:08:46.202
MATT: "Oh yeah, this here is my boat. What's your
name, sir?"

01:08:46.202 --> 01:08:47.220
TRAVIS: Fjord.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:48.558
MATT: "Fjord. Jimmy."

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:49.476
TRAVIS: Jimmy.

01:08:49.476 --> 01:08:50.400
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you."

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.267
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

01:08:51.267 --> 01:08:53.659
MATT: "You much of a shipman yourself?"

01:08:53.659 --> 01:08:58.471
TRAVIS: Little bit, little bit, my friends here
were hoping to explore the coast a bit. And if I

01:08:58.471 --> 01:09:01.420
could put some coin in your pocket, I was
wondering if you would mind parting with your

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.124
vessel here for a little bit.

01:09:03.124 --> 01:09:07.391
MATT: We'll say, because you have a sailor's
background at this point, you guys converse back

01:09:07.391 --> 01:09:12.575
and forth a bit. You swap some stories with
him about how he used to be a dockworker, and some

01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:14.695
of the ships he was on back in the day.

01:09:14.695 --> 01:09:16.523
TRAVIS: Tales of the worst greenhorns you've ever
worked with.

01:09:16.523 --> 01:09:20.339
MATT: Yeah, about five minutes of back and forth
you get to the point where you're both laughing

01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:25.460
and feel comfy. Eventually he goes, "Don't even
worry about the money, just, I'll keep an eye on

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.570
"out here and don't take it too far out in the bay.
When you're done, bring it back."

01:09:29.676 --> 01:09:31.539
TRAVIS: That is most kind of you, we are much
obliged.

01:09:31.539 --> 01:09:38.497
MATT: "Least I could do." He goes ahead and helps
untie the boat. You have it at your disposal.

01:09:38.497 --> 01:09:41.294
LAURA: Is it big enough for all of us?

01:09:41.294 --> 01:09:43.033
TRAVIS: Is it big enough for all of us?

01:09:43.033 --> 01:09:51.952
MATT: You can certainly try. Comfortably it can
fit four people. Uncomfortably it could fit you

01:09:51.952 --> 01:09:57.550
all space-wise, you're uncertain as to the ship's
ability to hold the load.

01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:01.611
MARISHA: Nott, why don't we just pull you along
since you have your water-walking ring? It would

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:02.846
be like skiing.

01:10:02.846 --> 01:10:06.179
TRAVIS: Actually, that's not a terrible idea. I
was going to volunteer to be pulled by--

01:10:06.179 --> 01:10:12.624
SAM: I weigh less than Yasha's sword. So if you
want to save some weight--

01:10:12.624 --> 01:10:15.819
LAURA: That's true, Yasha could put the ring on.

01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:19.786
SAM: Oh, but I would have to take it off.

01:10:19.786 --> 01:10:21.494
MARISHA: Then you'd ride in the boat.

01:10:21.494 --> 01:10:26.557
LAURA: Yeah, and you'd be safe in the boat.
Surrounded by water in the ocean.

01:10:26.579 --> 01:10:30.521
LIAM: Have we been led to the boat?

01:10:30.521 --> 01:10:31.460
MATT: Yeah.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.906
TRAVIS: It's tied up to the dock.

01:10:32.906 --> 01:10:35.622
LIAM: Yeah, I'm leaving them and I'm going to sit
in the boat. I'm pulling out my book and I'm

01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:38.790
slapping it down and I start to mutter to myself.
This is going to take a while.

01:10:38.805 --> 01:10:43.572
TRAVIS: Caleb seems very comfortable. Since it
only fits a few folks, I--

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.101
SAM: I'll stay on the shore, it's fine.

01:10:45.101 --> 01:10:49.788
TRAVIS: No, you have to come with. I was going to
volunteer to trail behind; the armor helps.

01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:55.218
LAURA: Maybe I should too, because, you know, I'm
watery now.

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:56.609
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right!

01:10:56.609 --> 01:10:57.667
LAURA: Yeah.

01:10:57.667 --> 01:10:58.626
SAM: You are.

01:10:58.626 --> 01:11:01.593
LAURA: I am blue and that's the same color as the
sea.

01:11:01.593 --> 01:11:03.739
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little smaller so
that I take up less space in the boat.

01:11:03.739 --> 01:11:08.185
TRAVIS: What? You get smaller? What do you mean?

01:11:08.185 --> 01:11:18.873
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn into a shaggy-looking
half-elf, literally probably look a bit like

01:11:18.873 --> 01:11:20.202
Shaggy from Scooby-doo.

01:11:20.202 --> 01:11:24.617
TRAVIS: Is that a Disguise Self thing?

01:11:24.617 --> 01:11:26.473
MATT: Yeah.

01:11:26.473 --> 01:11:28.269
TRAVIS: Does it change your physical weight and
stuff?

01:11:28.269 --> 01:11:29.370
SAM: I don't think it changes your weight.

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:30.472
MATT: It doesn't change his weight, but--

01:11:30.472 --> 01:11:36.584
TALIESIN: It changes the amount of volume, but I
actually do change volumetrically in size though.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:40.059
I can get several feet shorter. It's a firbolg
thing.

01:11:40.059 --> 01:11:44.484
TRAVIS: Oh, it is a firbolg thing! Well, fuck, that's
awesome!

01:11:44.484 --> 01:11:46.143
TALIESIN: I can seem up to three feet shorter,
but--

01:11:46.143 --> 01:11:47.493
SAM: Yeah, <i>seem.</i>

01:11:47.493 --> 01:11:51.818
MATT: Yeah, volumetrically it wouldn't make that
much of a difference for you.

01:11:51.818 --> 01:11:53.803
TALIESIN: Well, I did it anyway.

01:11:53.803 --> 01:11:56.723
TRAVIS: I think you'll be fine, actually, if Jester
and I are trailing behind.

01:11:56.799 --> 01:12:00.146
SAM: How is Jester going to trail behind? Because
her dad has sweaty palms?

01:12:00.146 --> 01:12:03.853
TRAVIS: Some people aren't scared of the water,
Nott. It's actually quite safe.

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:12.481
SAM: They are wrong. It's horrifying! There's
monsters in it, you can't see down below, it can

01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:15.136
snuff you out in a few moments.

01:12:15.136 --> 01:12:18.320
TALIESIN: You've just described every environment
that life can manifest in.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.870
TRAVIS: Look, Nott. And I reach down into the
water and touch it with my hand. There is

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.306
absolutely noth-- (yells). I just fall right
into the water.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:25.324
SAM: Oh no!

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.788
MATT: Fjord just disappears beneath the surface.

01:12:26.788 --> 01:12:28.028
TRAVIS: Just churning bubbles and stuff.

01:12:28.028 --> 01:12:29.414
SAM: It's not worth it, let's go!

01:12:29.414 --> 01:12:33.882
TRAVIS: I pop back up. See? Totally fine.

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.771
SAM: What was it that got you?

01:12:35.771 --> 01:12:37.326
TRAVIS: You'll never know.

01:12:37.326 --> 01:12:38.727
LAURA: Hey, Yasha.

01:12:38.727 --> 01:12:39.611
ASHLEY: Yes?

01:12:39.611 --> 01:12:40.518
LAURA: This is the sea.

01:12:40.518 --> 01:12:43.138
ASHLEY: Yes, I've--

01:12:43.138 --> 01:12:44.975
LAURA: It's pretty, huh?

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.638
ASHLEY: It is very pretty. Actually, I've been
looking at it already. At night.

01:12:49.638 --> 01:12:53.169
LAURA: Oh, so you were lying.

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:55.642
ASHLEY: Yeah, well, I just didn't want to tell you
guys everything.

01:12:55.642 --> 01:12:57.065
TRAVIS: Have you been here a few days already?

01:12:57.065 --> 01:12:58.013
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:12:58.013 --> 01:12:58.918
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:12:58.918 --> 01:13:01.845
ASHLEY: Been here for three days.

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:02.788
LAURA: What?

01:13:02.788 --> 01:13:05.195
SAM: That's longer than us! How did you know we
were coming?

01:13:05.195 --> 01:13:06.940
ASHLEY: I didn't know you were coming.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.409
TALIESIN: Are we calling dibs on the boat?

01:13:08.409 --> 01:13:18.167
ASHLEY: Maybe-- this is the closest ocean that I
knew. Maybe your message did get across, Jester,

01:13:18.167 --> 01:13:21.433
and I did hear it somewhere in the corner of my
brain.

01:13:21.433 --> 01:13:22.552
LAURA: I like that.

01:13:22.552 --> 01:13:23.508
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:13:23.508 --> 01:13:24.918
LAURA: I get in the water.

01:13:24.918 --> 01:13:29.012
TRAVIS: Well, somebody's got to ask if anybody has
any idea where the entrance to the--

01:13:29.099 --> 01:13:31.580
TALIESIN: I think I saw it, if I recall.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.668
TRAVIS: The entrance?

01:13:32.668 --> 01:13:35.382
TALIESIN: She pointed it out, didn't she? When we
were--

01:13:35.382 --> 01:13:39.886
MATT: She pointed a basic direction, but there was
no visual guide to it.

01:13:39.886 --> 01:13:42.539
TALIESIN: I'll feel confident in my knowledge,
that's fine.

01:13:42.539 --> 01:13:44.021
LAURA: Go ask your sailor friend, Fjord!

01:13:44.021 --> 01:13:45.477
TRAVIS: I'm in the water with you.

01:13:45.477 --> 01:13:48.474
LAURA: Yeah, get back out and go ask him where the
Sluice is.

01:13:48.474 --> 01:13:52.846
MATT: You come out, dripping, the water slowly
pouring out from under your armor.

01:13:52.846 --> 01:13:54.564
LAURA: Woo! Yeah!

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:56.102
TRAVIS: I'm covered in armor.

01:13:56.102 --> 01:13:57.589
LAURA: It's still wet!

01:13:57.589 --> 01:14:05.112
TRAVIS: Okay. Price of a good joke, I'm afraid. Are
you knowledgeable about the entrance to the Sluice

01:14:05.112 --> 01:14:07.354
Cove? Sluice Weave?

01:14:07.354 --> 01:14:13.153
MATT: "I've heard of that, but I don't really know
much about that, sorry."

01:14:13.153 --> 01:14:14.233
TRAVIS: Well.

01:14:14.233 --> 01:14:17.948
MATT: "Good luck, though."

01:14:18.024 --> 01:14:19.030
TRAVIS: Thanks.

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:20.341
LAURA: Was he telling the truth?

01:14:20.341 --> 01:14:21.941
TRAVIS: Yeah, he was telling the truth.

01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:23.872
LAURA: How do you know?

01:14:23.872 --> 01:14:25.670
TRAVIS: Because I know sailors.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:29.956
SAM: Are you sure about that? A guy who works at
the docks in the harbor where this thing is

01:14:30.058 --> 01:14:33.542
wouldn't know the location of everything under the
water?

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:36.784
TRAVIS: Why don't you threaten him with a trove of
goblins around the wharf while--

01:14:36.784 --> 01:14:44.453
SAM: That would have worked if someone had been a
little snappier with the Thaumaturgy.

01:14:44.453 --> 01:14:47.349
LAURA: It's my fault, I'm sorry! I yell from the
water.

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:51.280
TRAVIS: Is there anyone else on the docks? Anyone
else that we can see?

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.782
MATT: Yeah. There's a handful of other people
that are in the process of-- Largely on the other

01:14:55.782 --> 01:14:59.244
side where that bigger ship is that's being
currently unloaded or loaded into-- you can't tell

01:14:59.313 --> 01:15:00.463
from this distance.

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:02.404
TRAVIS: Are there any crownsguard-- or I'm going to
say zol-eezzo?

01:15:02.404 --> 01:15:03.317
MATT: Zolezzo.

01:15:03.405 --> 01:15:04.470
TRAVIS: Zolezzo, thank you.

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:07.190
MATT: There are. You can see two zolezzo that are
just patrolling the docks.

01:15:07.257 --> 01:15:10.871
LIAM: With all this dicking about, how long would
you guestimate I've been muttering in the boat?

01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:13.528
MATT: Ten minutes.

01:15:13.528 --> 01:15:14.710
LIAM: Ten minutes, okay.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.651
TRAVIS: Hey Beau!

01:15:15.651 --> 01:15:16.446
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:16.446 --> 01:15:18.177
TRAVIS: You know those people skills we've been
working on?

01:15:18.177 --> 01:15:19.375
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty good.

01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:24.762
TRAVIS: You want to ask the zolezzo if they mind
telling some tourists about the fabled entrance to

01:15:24.762 --> 01:15:26.988
the Sluice Weave?

01:15:26.988 --> 01:15:31.358
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. (sighs) All right.

01:15:31.358 --> 01:15:32.491
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:35.755
MARISHA: So, my story, just so, you know, I can
really commit to this.

01:15:35.755 --> 01:15:37.415
TRAVIS: Ooh, good, yeah. Okay.

01:15:37.415 --> 01:15:38.472
MARISHA: I'm a tourist.

01:15:38.472 --> 01:15:39.236
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:15:39.236 --> 01:15:40.934
MARISHA: I'm still Beau, right? I'm Beauregard the
tourist.

01:15:40.934 --> 01:15:42.285
TRAVIS: You're going to use your real name?

01:15:42.285 --> 01:15:43.688
MARISHA: Should I not use my real name?

01:15:43.688 --> 01:15:44.841
TRAVIS: Try something else.

01:15:44.928 --> 01:15:46.489
MARISHA: I'm Julia! From--

01:15:46.489 --> 01:15:47.977
TRAVIS: You don't look like a Julia.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.785
MARISHA: I am Leslie.

01:15:49.785 --> 01:15:50.859
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:15:50.859 --> 01:15:51.820
MARISHA: Tracy?

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:52.809
TRAVIS: Better.

01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:53.694
MARISHA: Tracy.

01:15:53.694 --> 01:15:54.674
TRAVIS: Totally Tracy.

01:15:54.674 --> 01:15:55.914
MARISHA: Okay. I look like a Tracy-- okay.

01:15:55.914 --> 01:15:56.771
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:15:56.771 --> 01:15:58.504
MARISHA: So I'm Tracy, from Zadash!

01:15:58.504 --> 01:15:59.337
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:15:59.337 --> 01:16:03.179
MARISHA: (Valley girl voice) And, you know, my
parents are paying for just a little bit of a

01:16:03.413 --> 01:16:09.382
spring break so that I can, like, go find myself
before I go into college, right? Before I go to uni.

01:16:09.382 --> 01:16:10.731
TRAVIS: You know this person, don't you?

01:16:10.836 --> 01:16:11.726
MARISHA: Is this a thing?

01:16:11.726 --> 01:16:12.801
TRAVIS: This is somebody you've met.

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:15.531
MARISHA: (normal voice) I'm trying to figure it
out. Because if I'm just me, I'm just going to be an

01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:17.154
asshole. So I have to be somebody else.

01:16:17.154 --> 01:16:18.847
TRAVIS: That is very observant. Yeah.

01:16:18.847 --> 01:16:26.960
MARISHA: So-- and I heard about this mysterious
Sluice entrance. This Sluice thing like--

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.141
TRAVIS: Do that.

01:16:28.141 --> 01:16:30.261
MARISHA: You want me to do this, yeah? So I should
take my hair--

01:16:30.261 --> 01:16:32.123
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you don't have hair on the side
of your head, so.

01:16:32.151 --> 01:16:33.133
(laughter)

01:16:33.133 --> 01:16:35.622
MARISHA: Well, here. I'll just use this side,
right?

01:16:35.622 --> 01:16:41.502
TRAVIS: Yep. Give it the old-- Yeah! Fierce.

01:16:41.502 --> 01:16:42.803
MARISHA: Is that good? Does that work?

01:16:42.803 --> 01:16:43.557
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.678
MARISHA: Yeah. Do I find the most insecure-looking
guy and then use that?

01:16:45.678 --> 01:16:46.885
TRAVIS: I like it, go with it.

01:16:46.885 --> 01:16:49.352
MARISHA: All right, I go to the most 
insecure-looking guy.

01:16:49.464 --> 01:16:54.750
MATT: Make a general insight check to try and
gauge which of them is the most insecure.

01:16:54.814 --> 01:16:57.859
SAM: Insecurity check.

01:16:57.859 --> 01:17:06.816
MARISHA: Jeez, I need to not use Gil's die ever.
14.

01:17:06.816 --> 01:17:07.954
LAURA: Oh, that's not bad!

01:17:07.954 --> 01:17:09.469
MATT: That's not bad at all!

01:17:09.469 --> 01:17:11.647
MARISHA: It's okay!

01:17:11.647 --> 01:17:16.860
MATT: All right. You look, and of the two that are
there, one of them seems to be pretty preoccupied

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:23.943
with the ships that are being loaded. And one of
them appears to be half-present, probably in

01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:30.662
mid-daydream, yawning at his post, and looks
younger than the other one. Between the two of

01:17:30.662 --> 01:17:33.756
them, he's probably the most insecure, if you had
to decide.

01:17:33.756 --> 01:17:41.873
MARISHA: (Valley girl voice) Oh gosh, isn't the
water just so beautiful? Man, it's--

01:17:41.873 --> 01:17:43.654
MATT: "I'm sorry, can I help you?"

01:17:43.654 --> 01:17:50.535
MARISHA: It's hot out here, just so moist. This
air, right?

01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:53.412
(laughter)

01:17:53.412 --> 01:17:57.235
MARISHA: And I-- (sighs) What's your name?

01:17:57.235 --> 01:18:02.591
MATT: "I'm sorry, I am working at the moment--"

01:18:02.591 --> 01:18:05.790
MARISHA: Oh great, because I could totally use
some help.

01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:09.771
MATT: You can see his eyes roll and he goes, "What
can I do to help you, then?"

01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:15.061
MARISHA: Well, you see, I'm from out of town-- I'm
Tracy, by the way. What's your name?

01:18:15.061 --> 01:18:24.081
MATT: He sighs heavily and reaches out and finally
takes the hand. He goes, "Hello, I am Zolezzo Merpol."

01:18:24.081 --> 01:18:33.711
MARISHA: Merpol, hi. It's just, you know, I'm here
and I'm trying to get the true Nicodranas

01:18:33.711 --> 01:18:41.638
experience while I'm in town and, you know, I
just, I've heard rumors from people, you know,

01:18:41.638 --> 01:18:47.877
about this thing called the Sluice Weave. And you
know, I would just love to see it, see if it's

01:18:47.877 --> 01:18:49.369
real, you know?

01:18:49.369 --> 01:18:51.007
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:18:51.007 --> 01:18:53.400
LAURA: I love imagining Beau in the outfit that
she's in.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.425
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:56.277
LAURA: Freaking wraps on her arms.

01:18:56.277 --> 01:18:57.405
TRAVIS: Bruises on her arms.

01:18:57.405 --> 01:18:58.770
LIAM: A fucking stick up the back.

01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:00.195
TRAVIS: Old busted lip scars.

01:19:00.195 --> 01:19:03.884
LIAM: Although, to be fair, I've seen this many times at
St. Patrick's Day parades in New York--

01:19:03.974 --> 01:19:05.114
MARISHA: 14.

01:19:05.114 --> 01:19:06.444
LIAM: (slurred) Excuse me, officer?

01:19:06.444 --> 01:19:09.864
MATT: 14?

01:19:09.943 --> 01:19:11.381
TRAVIS: Come on, baby.

01:19:11.381 --> 01:19:17.014
MARISHA: I'm too dumb to be a risk, right? Too
vapid to be a hazard.

01:19:17.014 --> 01:19:21.123
MATT: He goes, "Oh, that is a very specific
curiosity."

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:28.455
MARISHA: I'm into curiosities. I'm a curious
person.

01:19:28.455 --> 01:19:38.509
MATT: "Well, the Sluice Weave is a series of
tunnels that were installed probably a century ago

01:19:38.509 --> 01:19:45.484
"that are responsible for-- They are ducts that
guide water from the ocean to a series of small

01:19:45.484 --> 01:19:56.012
"engines in the city that help propel the furnaces
that the various businesses and locations here

01:19:56.012 --> 01:20:00.343
"that require that sort of intense power to
utilize. It's also--"

01:20:00.343 --> 01:20:02.300
MARISHA: Wow! I hear they're haunted. Are they
haunted?

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.690
MATT: "Well, not haunted, per se. But there
are--"

01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:08.099
MARISHA: Oh, you gave me a little smirk. They're
totally haunted!

01:20:08.099 --> 01:20:12.926
(laughter)

01:20:12.926 --> 01:20:18.382
MATT: He goes, "Not haunted, but there are
elements to it--"

01:20:18.382 --> 01:20:20.268
MARISHA: I give him a little (giggle).

01:20:20.268 --> 01:20:21.799
MATT: He's like (uncomfortable laugh).

01:20:21.799 --> 01:20:24.674
(laughter)

01:20:24.674 --> 01:20:36.778
MATT: He goes, "There also-- There are things that
help maintain the Sluice ducts, and occasionally

01:20:36.851 --> 01:20:39.832
"help protect elements of the bay if ever it's
under attack."

01:20:39.832 --> 01:20:45.007
MARISHA: I bet you're first in line to protect the
city against an attack, aren't you?

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:51.717
MATT: (sheepishly) "I mean, there's been-- You
know. About a year ago they had this one ship that

01:20:51.717 --> 01:20:59.260
"came into the-- There were these thieves-- And I
happened to be on job at the moment and so-- yeah!"

01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.430
MARISHA: Wow! So interesting. So, have you been
down there?

01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:10.499
MATT: "I haven't been down in the Sluice area,
there. The entrance, as far as I know, is mostly

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:12.192
"hidden, the one inside the city."

01:21:12.192 --> 01:21:14.246
MARISHA: Oh, so there's one inside the city?

01:21:14.246 --> 01:21:15.496
MATT: "Somewhere, I don't know."

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:17.932
MARISHA: Oh wow. I heard there was one in the
ocean!

01:21:17.932 --> 01:21:25.431
MATT: "Yeah, there's two or three, I think, that
are right down off the side-- Here, come here."

01:21:25.431 --> 01:21:28.790
And he leads you over.

01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:31.008
TRAVIS: We're all just aghast. Just like--

01:21:31.008 --> 01:21:33.882
MARISHA: I turn to Fjord and I go (gagging
sound).

01:21:33.882 --> 01:21:40.028
MATT: (laughs) He leads you over across the dock
for a bit. And he points down in the water and

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:48.966
goes, "I think somewhere in this vicinity there is
sort of the intake tube or pipe, where the ocean

01:21:48.966 --> 01:21:51.738
"water is brought in to the Sluice ducts."

01:21:51.738 --> 01:21:54.616
MARISHA: Sounds like it's got a lot of suction in
the intake.

01:21:54.616 --> 01:21:56.524
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:21:56.524 --> 01:22:00.265
TRAVIS: Oh my god. This cake needs more layers,
girl!

01:22:00.265 --> 01:22:01.716
MARISHA: Perception? Is that what you said?

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.102
MATT: Perception, yes.

01:22:03.102 --> 01:22:04.870
MARISHA: Okay. 15.

01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:12.400
MATT: From this distance it's too hard to see
beneath the water. It gets a little too murky. But

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:17.276
he points in a general direction and you get a
loose idea of where it may be.

01:22:17.276 --> 01:22:19.091
MARISHA: Wow, yeah. Cool.

01:22:19.091 --> 01:22:22.303
MATT: He's like, "So what are you up to while
you're in the city?"

01:22:22.303 --> 01:22:25.702
(laughter)

01:22:25.726 --> 01:22:32.464
MARISHA: Wow! Yeah, you know, I'm just so busy.
You know, just trying to fill my schedule with

01:22:32.464 --> 01:22:34.294
things. I should probably go now.

01:22:34.294 --> 01:22:35.654
MATT: "Of course! Where are you staying?"

01:22:35.654 --> 01:22:46.906
MARISHA: (forced giggling) I'm staying at the
Lavish Chateau!

01:22:46.906 --> 01:22:51.170
MATT: "Oh, wow! That is a very expensive place."

01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:53.464
MARISHA: I know. You probably couldn't afford it,
so--

01:22:53.464 --> 01:22:56.113
ALL: Ooh!

01:22:56.113 --> 01:23:07.228
MATT: You can see the visible (pained grunt) to
his chest. He's like, "Well, perhaps I'll-- If you

01:23:07.228 --> 01:23:11.891
"want other things to see around the city when I'm
not on my post, I could maybe come by and give you

01:23:11.891 --> 01:23:13.192
"a little tour?"

01:23:13.192 --> 01:23:15.069
MARISHA: Sure, that sounds great!

01:23:15.069 --> 01:23:20.194
MATT: "Of course. What are you doing right now? I
only have about 40 minutes until I get to switch

01:23:20.194 --> 01:23:22.620
"my shift, and then I'm off for the rest of the
afternoon."

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.225
MARISHA: (forced giggling)

01:23:24.225 --> 01:23:26.495
TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted.

01:23:26.495 --> 01:23:30.326
LIAM: This is so painful, I feel like I should
make a concentration check on my spell.

01:23:30.326 --> 01:23:37.088
MARISHA: You know. I'm actually doing a quick
little boat tour, just right over there. But I'll

01:23:37.088 --> 01:23:39.098
be right back, okay byeee!

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:42.633
(laughter)

01:23:42.633 --> 01:23:44.407
MATT: He looks a bit flabbergasted.

01:23:44.407 --> 01:23:46.504
MARISHA: Just over there. I'll be right back!
Just-- (giggle)

01:23:46.504 --> 01:23:50.091
MATT: "See you later! What was it? What was the
name? Tracy?"

01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:53.643
MARISHA: Tracy! What was your name?

01:23:53.643 --> 01:23:57.143
MATT: He sits there for a second and goes
"Tracy--"

01:23:57.143 --> 01:23:58.489
MARISHA: Oh wait, your name is Marisol--

01:23:58.489 --> 01:23:59.504
MATT: Yeah, Merpol.

01:23:59.504 --> 01:24:01.195
MARISHA: Porpal? Marpol?

01:24:01.195 --> 01:24:04.474
MATT: (laughs) Merpol.

01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:07.731
MARISHA: Merpol! Merpol?

01:24:07.731 --> 01:24:09.553
TRAVIS: Don't write that down.

01:24:09.553 --> 01:24:11.442
MARISHA: (heavy breathing) That was--

01:24:11.442 --> 01:24:13.067
LAURA: Wait. Wouldn't it be funny if that was
Marius?

01:24:13.067 --> 01:24:22.077
MATT: Yeah, no. Different name. He thinks to
himself, "Tracy." And continues the rest of his

01:24:22.077 --> 01:24:24.281
post along the dockside.

01:24:24.281 --> 01:24:26.044
MARISHA: I need a shower.

01:24:26.044 --> 01:24:31.960
TRAVIS: <i>Where</i> did that come from?

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.762
MARISHA: I don't know, I think it was something
deep down inside me that I actually really hate.

01:24:36.762 --> 01:24:45.471
That it's there. It's maybe always been there. And
then I had to-- (deep breath) Let's go. I don't

01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:46.909
want to talk about that anymore.

01:24:46.909 --> 01:24:48.533
LAURA: She lives inside of you.

01:24:48.533 --> 01:24:50.286
MARISHA: Who the fuck is Tracy?

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:52.518
TRAVIS: Let's go.

01:24:52.518 --> 01:24:55.462
MATT: So, what are you doing?

01:24:55.462 --> 01:24:58.209
LIAM: I'm casting Find Familiar and I'm changing
Frumpkin's shape.

01:24:58.209 --> 01:25:00.243
MATT: Into a--?

01:25:00.243 --> 01:25:01.062
LIAM: Octopus.

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:02.705
MATT: Ooh!

01:25:02.705 --> 01:25:03.805
TRAVIS: An octopus?

01:25:03.805 --> 01:25:05.049
MARISHA: It's come true!

01:25:05.049 --> 01:25:09.486
MATT: As you guys all begin to gather into the
boat, the two of you, I think you said you're

01:25:09.486 --> 01:25:11.111
staying off to the side? Jester and Fjord?

01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:12.178
LAURA: I guess so.

01:25:12.178 --> 01:25:13.952
TRAVIS: We're getting into the water and we'll
just either hold on to the back, or if we have

01:25:13.952 --> 01:25:16.322
rope on the dock, I'll just tie four foot--

01:25:16.322 --> 01:25:21.919
MATT: Yeah, there's extra rope available. So you
guys swim beneath as it continues off through the

01:25:21.919 --> 01:25:23.058
water.

01:25:23.058 --> 01:25:29.237
SAM: As we're untying the boat-- Right? It's tied
up? As we're untying the boat, I'm going to hide

01:25:29.237 --> 01:25:30.880
behind a pillar.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.618
MATT: Okay.

01:25:32.618 --> 01:25:34.329
LAURA: Do we see her?

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.383
MATT: We'll find out. Roll a stealth check.

01:25:36.383 --> 01:25:38.289
SAM: That's a two.

01:25:38.289 --> 01:25:40.677
MATT: Plus?

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:41.768
SAM: Plus ten.

01:25:41.768 --> 01:25:46.533
MATT: Everyone but Fjord sees you.

01:25:46.533 --> 01:25:51.003
(laughter)

01:25:51.003 --> 01:25:56.982
LIAM: Nott the Brave, are you coming with us?

01:25:56.982 --> 01:25:58.923
SAM: Oh yeah, I was just checking the rigging.

01:25:58.923 --> 01:26:02.480
LIAM: Come on, I saved a seat up by me and
Frumpkin.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.072
SAM: Great. I'm coming.

01:26:04.072 --> 01:26:05.480
TALIESIN: You'll be all right.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:13.481
LIAM: I have Frumpkin slither his way onto Nott's
back and do a cozy hug from behind over the

01:26:13.481 --> 01:26:15.489
shoulder. Not on the head.

01:26:15.489 --> 01:26:17.201
LAURA: Like Clarota. Like (brain-sucking sound).

01:26:17.201 --> 01:26:21.618
LIAM: No, because that's weird. So just over the
shoulder, and then the tentacles tickle her face

01:26:21.618 --> 01:26:22.733
and stuff.

01:26:22.733 --> 01:26:24.190
MARISHA: And that's not weird?

01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:25.446
LIAM: That's the joke.

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:27.706
TRAVIS: There you go.

01:26:27.706 --> 01:26:31.420
LAURA: Don't worry, Nott. If you fall over the
side, Fjord and I will catch you.

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:36.010
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're literally back here as a
safety net, so don't fret.

01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:37.057
SAM: All right.

01:26:37.057 --> 01:26:41.406
TRAVIS: Beau? Point us in the direction that your
boyfriend alluded to.

01:26:41.406 --> 01:26:43.555
MARISHA: Fuck you, man. It's over there.

01:26:43.555 --> 01:26:50.309
MATT: You guys begin to row over in that
direction. Who all is keeping an eye in the

01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:51.497
water?

01:26:51.497 --> 01:26:52.565
TRAVIS: In the water?

01:26:52.565 --> 01:26:54.107
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a perception
check, please.

01:26:54.107 --> 01:26:57.969
LIAM: Can I assist by throwing Frumpkin into the
water and looking?

01:26:57.969 --> 01:27:01.071
MATT: Sure! So go ahead and take advantage on
that, between you and Frumpkin.

01:27:01.071 --> 01:27:02.241
MARISHA: Poor Frumpkin.

01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:07.731
TALIESIN: 25.

01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:17.395
MATT: Okay. Glancing through the water, you watch
as one of the sun rays definitely hits a clear

01:27:17.395 --> 01:27:24.757
patch of the ocean below you. And you see a brief
glimmer of what looks to be a either metal or

01:27:24.757 --> 01:27:33.245
stone piece that is different from the rest of the
natural, slightly eroded rock. You see a circle,

01:27:33.245 --> 01:27:39.560
maybe a four- or five-foot-wide opening that's
about 40 feet down.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.968
TALIESIN: Frumpkin, go take a look at that, if you
wouldn't mind.

01:27:42.968 --> 01:27:48.125
LIAM: Frumpkin, go take a look at that, if you
wouldn't mind. (splash sound) Down towards it.

01:27:48.125 --> 01:27:49.386
MATT: All righty.

01:27:49.386 --> 01:27:53.266
LIAM: And I have my hand on Nott's shoulder, doing
that thing.

01:27:53.266 --> 01:28:06.799
MATT: Okay. So, there is a circular pipe entrance
or a tunnel entrance 40 feet down, right as the

01:28:06.799 --> 01:28:13.520
water gets darker and more murky. Bits of
clustered seaweed begin to come up and tickle the

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.496
bottoms of Frumpkin's tentacles in that vicinity.
Elements of it are blocking the front, but you can

01:28:18.496 --> 01:28:23.679
clearly see there is a dark tunnel that continues
into the earth, beneath the city, beneath the

01:28:23.679 --> 01:28:25.841
docks. You don't know how far it goes,
necessarily.

01:28:25.841 --> 01:28:28.460
LIAM: Do Frumpkin and I see anything alive or
moving down here?

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:30.437
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:28:30.437 --> 01:28:34.935
LIAM: Pretty good. 18.

01:28:34.935 --> 01:28:47.362
MATT: You do not see anything alive or moving in
this vicinity. Best you can see, the tunnel

01:28:47.362 --> 01:28:55.405
continues in for about 15 or so feet, and there is
a metal grate. You can see eight or so bars

01:28:55.405 --> 01:29:02.994
across. Actually, about ten bars, about an inch
thick each, and they're horizontal, though it's a

01:29:02.994 --> 01:29:04.692
little bit tilted to one side.

01:29:04.692 --> 01:29:06.428
LIAM: How far apart are each of the bars?

01:29:06.428 --> 01:29:11.877
MATT: With eight of them and it's about four and a
half, five feet across. Sorry, ten across. It

01:29:11.877 --> 01:29:13.917
would be about six inches between each.

01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:16.846
LIAM: I think my octopus could probably squeeze
through that.

01:29:16.846 --> 01:29:18.341
MATT: Yeah, your octopus could.

01:29:18.341 --> 01:29:19.754
LIAM: (plopping sound)

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:20.707
MATT: All right.

01:29:20.707 --> 01:29:21.869
LAURA: Are you saying what you see?

01:29:21.869 --> 01:29:22.819
LIAM: Yeah.

01:29:22.819 --> 01:29:25.244
LAURA: Caleb, are the bars rusted? Did they seem
rusted at all?

01:29:25.244 --> 01:29:28.969
LIAM: Did they seem rusted?

01:29:28.969 --> 01:29:38.607
MATT: Oh, the bars? There isn't a lot of rust, as
much as there is a lot of barnacles and other

01:29:38.607 --> 01:29:45.325
natural sediment that is gathered on edges of it.
You can still see the metal. You can see a little

01:29:45.325 --> 01:29:53.114
bit of rust here and there. Looks like more
natural elements seem to have crusted and

01:29:53.114 --> 01:29:54.840
clustered around parts of it.

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.974
LIAM: I'm going to urge Frumpkin on further, to see
what we can see. Frumpkin has dark vision.

01:29:58.974 --> 01:30:00.351
MATT: Okay.

01:30:00.351 --> 01:30:10.727
About-- Let's see here. About 60 or so feet
into the tunnel, it curves upward.

01:30:10.727 --> 01:30:14.555
MARISHA: 60 feet.

01:30:14.555 --> 01:30:18.880
SAM: 40 feet down, 60 feet into the tunnel, and
then up, still underwater.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.938
MATT: Yeah.

01:30:19.938 --> 01:30:23.765
LIAM: Up he goes.

01:30:23.765 --> 01:30:29.460
MATT: All right. About 30 or so feet up, the water
breaks. There's a surface, though there is no

01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:32.584
light. Does Frumpkin's octopus form have
darkvision?

01:30:32.584 --> 01:30:33.860
LIAM: Darkvision, yes.

01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:36.359
MATT: Yes. Okay. So does Frumpkin--

01:30:36.359 --> 01:30:40.113
LIAM: Yeah, crests up and pokes his eye nubs out
of the water.

01:30:40.113 --> 01:30:47.253
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin floats there on top for a
second, and you can see now where it emerges--

01:30:47.253 --> 01:30:49.501
LIAM: Looking for anything moving here, while
we're up here.

01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:55.539
MATT: There is another set of bars right at the
top of that tunnel, that Frumpkin has pushed and

01:30:55.539 --> 01:31:01.034
squeezed through to come through. So there's bars,
like a grate, on the way in, and then a grate once

01:31:01.034 --> 01:31:02.640
you curve upward into the tunnel.

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.191
LIAM: So he's come through a second set.

01:31:04.191 --> 01:31:07.891
MATT: Come through a second set, and then breaks
the surface of the water about a foot beyond that.

01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:13.402
And now you can see, it is closed off mostly,
except for a tunnel that continues deeper in the

01:31:13.402 --> 01:31:17.541
same direction that the lower tunnel went. And
that one continues on for a bit.

01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:19.112
LIAM: Muttering all this as it happens.

01:31:19.112 --> 01:31:21.937
LAURA: Is there any air between the water and the
grate?

01:31:21.937 --> 01:31:24.723
MATT: There is no air between the water and the
grate.

01:31:24.723 --> 01:31:25.739
LIAM: This is all water.

01:31:25.739 --> 01:31:29.815
MATT: Yeah. It's all water up, and then there's
the grate, and then it turns into this tunnel that

01:31:29.815 --> 01:31:34.633
continues inward, and there's about a foot of
water beyond that, and then there's air from that point.

01:31:35.162 --> 01:31:41.411
LIAM: I'm going to speed him back to the first
grate, and have him took for the locking mechanism

01:31:41.411 --> 01:31:42.686
if there is one.

01:31:42.686 --> 01:31:44.428
MATT: Make an investigation check for Frumpkin.

01:31:44.428 --> 01:31:49.142
MARISHA: Oh, you have Knock. That's right. Fuck
yes.

01:31:49.142 --> 01:31:51.788
LIAM: That's investigation.

01:31:51.788 --> 01:31:53.416
SAM: Doesn't work underwater.

01:31:53.416 --> 01:31:56.949
LIAM: Or through an octopus. That's a 14.

01:31:56.949 --> 01:31:58.956
MARISHA: That's true, if you can't speak,
actually.

01:31:58.956 --> 01:32:07.535
MATT: 14? You can still mutter the incantation
underwater.

01:32:07.535 --> 01:32:09.167
MARISHA: (gurgling)

01:32:09.167 --> 01:32:13.739
LIAM: I think you said last campaign that you can
hold the air for one spell, possibly.

01:32:13.739 --> 01:32:19.055
MATT: Yeah, in the process of casting a spell, if
you're holding your breath, that's your breath.

01:32:19.055 --> 01:32:22.378
TRAVIS: (garbled) Go fuck yourself.

01:32:22.378 --> 01:32:30.858
MATT: That's the way to do it. Looking, there is
no locking mechanism. The grate isn't one that

01:32:30.858 --> 01:32:35.194
opens and closes. it's not a door, it's just in
place.

01:32:35.194 --> 01:32:39.514
LIAM: Okay. So he will swirl away and go back to
the second and do the same look around.

01:32:39.514 --> 01:32:41.259
MATT: Another investigation check.

01:32:41.259 --> 01:32:41.983
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

01:32:41.983 --> 01:32:46.212
TRAVIS: While he's doing that, can I pop my head
underwater and look around, just make sure there's

01:32:46.212 --> 01:32:48.899
no-- anything coming around?

01:32:48.899 --> 01:32:50.491
MATT: Perception check.

01:32:50.491 --> 01:32:55.766
MATT: The second grate also appears to not have a
locking or unlocking mechanism; they aren't meant

01:32:55.766 --> 01:33:01.983
to be removed, it seems, in a casual way. They
seem to be placed there intentionally for an

01:33:01.983 --> 01:33:03.439
indefinite period of time.

01:33:03.439 --> 01:33:04.871
LIAM: Okay. All right, buddy.

01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:05.499
TRAVIS: 17.

01:33:05.499 --> 01:33:13.214
MATT: 17? You see a number of fish swirling
through the various bits of kelp and seaweed that

01:33:13.214 --> 01:33:20.037
are pushing up from the bottom of the bay below.
It's beautiful. You can see the colors and

01:33:20.037 --> 01:33:26.047
glistening bits of silver as the fish curl through
the sunlight, but nothing catches your attention

01:33:26.047 --> 01:33:28.376
as dangerous in your immediate vicinity,
thankfully.

01:33:28.376 --> 01:33:33.707
ASHLEY: Could I look to see if anyone's watching
us out on the shore?

01:33:33.707 --> 01:33:35.372
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:33:35.372 --> 01:33:39.455
SAM and TRAVIS: Go Yasha. Go Yasha, go!

01:33:39.455 --> 01:33:44.333
ASHLEY: I don't think I actually see anything. I
think I forgot my glasses.

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:45.711
MATT: What did you roll?

01:33:45.711 --> 01:33:46.867
ASHLEY: I rolled a seven.

01:33:46.867 --> 01:33:52.951
MATT: Okay. You look out and people seem to be
working on the dock and, you know.

01:33:52.951 --> 01:33:54.318
ASHLEY: We're safe.

01:33:54.318 --> 01:33:59.034
LIAM: I'm sending him forward. And I do.

01:33:59.034 --> 01:34:02.569
MATT: Okay. So you're sending him further in?

01:34:02.569 --> 01:34:04.997
LIAM: Past-- you said it goes now straight that
way?

01:34:04.997 --> 01:34:15.866
MATT: The tunnel goes on for about another 60 or
so feet beyond that grate, before the tunnel opens

01:34:15.866 --> 01:34:24.239
up into a square-like chamber with a singular
pillar that marks the center of it. It's still one

01:34:24.239 --> 01:34:31.304
foot of water all throughout this entire area.
Once you go past this-- You can look past where

01:34:31.304 --> 01:34:36.308
this pillar is, the chamber seems to close off and
another tunnel continues on, almost like this is

01:34:36.308 --> 01:34:44.108
just a waypoint chamber. On the right side, you
see a much smaller grate: maybe a foot and a half,

01:34:44.108 --> 01:34:48.775
two feet across, with a more dense cross-lattice
of bars.

01:34:48.775 --> 01:34:51.806
LIAM: Not able for Frumpkin to squeeze through
that, I'm guessing.

01:34:51.806 --> 01:34:58.939
MATT: Frumpkin's size? How big of an octopus is
Frumpkin? An octopus, I'd say it would be about

01:34:58.939 --> 01:34:59.798
that big.

01:34:59.798 --> 01:35:01.601
LIAM: I'm imagining I am not summoning a gigantic
octopus.

01:35:01.601 --> 01:35:10.534
MATT: But octopuses can squeeze through some
pretty small spaces. Yeah, so I'd say make an

01:35:10.534 --> 01:35:13.941
athletics check for tiny octopus Frumpkin.

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:20.085
LIAM: And that would be strength-based, yeah?
Because it doesn't say on his thing. That is a nine.

01:35:20.609 --> 01:35:26.902
MATT: Frumpkin gets partially through but
the nature of the lattice and Frumpkin's

01:35:26.902 --> 01:35:33.551
unfamiliarity with the octopus form reaches a
point where it can't quite get all the way through.

01:35:33.551 --> 01:35:38.822
LIAM: That's true! It's only his second time. Okay
buddy, forget that. Back it up. Is there anything

01:35:38.822 --> 01:35:42.389
unique about the pillar down here or is it just
basic stonework?

01:35:42.389 --> 01:35:46.489
MATT: Looks like basic stonework, it has a slight
curvature to it but it's probably placed in here

01:35:46.489 --> 01:35:55.591
either as a load bearing piece since this is
beneath a heavier city or-- It doesn't look

01:35:55.591 --> 01:35:58.532
remarkable or have any other purpose beyond just
being a support pillar.

01:35:58.532 --> 01:36:02.813
LIAM: Are Frumpkin and I able to tell if this goes
water all the way to the ceiling of this chamber

01:36:02.813 --> 01:36:05.492
or is it water with air above? Or it's all water?

01:36:05.492 --> 01:36:11.019
MATT: The water only goes up to a foot, and then
it's air for the rest of it. It's about ten or so

01:36:11.019 --> 01:36:12.448
feet tall, the chamber.

01:36:12.448 --> 01:36:18.724
LIAM: Okay. Is there anything out of the ordinary
if he pokes his head up out of the water?

01:36:18.724 --> 01:36:20.539
MATT: Make a perception check?

01:36:20.539 --> 01:36:23.006
LIAM: 17.

01:36:23.006 --> 01:36:25.394
LAURA: Getting bored sitting in the water out
here.

01:36:25.394 --> 01:36:27.746
SAM: No! It's every lovely we should just stay
here all day.

01:36:27.746 --> 01:36:33.389
MATT: No guys, no better adventure then having all
your friends sit back and send your tiny friend.

01:36:33.389 --> 01:36:35.071
LIAM: You could always punch the wizard in the
head at any time.

01:36:35.071 --> 01:36:36.600
MATT: Yeah, exactly! No, I know.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.612
LAURA: Hey Yasha, let's go try to break through
that grate.

01:36:38.612 --> 01:36:45.677
MATT: So, 17? Looking around the water and it's
salt water, it's all ocean water coming in here.

01:36:45.677 --> 01:36:52.859
Occasionally, you see slight waves, little ripples
from different directions.

01:36:52.859 --> 01:36:58.561
LIAM: Okay so back on the boat I just say, I have
gone very far with him and it just keeps going.

01:36:58.561 --> 01:37:00.027
What do you guys want to do?

01:37:00.027 --> 01:37:02.482
LAURA: Get him back here and let's try to get
through that grate!

01:37:02.482 --> 01:37:06.780
ASHLEY: Are there any like buttons or key holes in
any of the grates?

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:10.167
LAURA: He looked through Frumpkin's eyes and there
was nothing.

01:37:10.167 --> 01:37:15.592
LIAM: I can't hear any of you, so tap me if you
want me to keep going: one time tap me or two

01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:17.618
times if you want me to pull Frumpkin out.

01:37:17.618 --> 01:37:19.741
LAURA: I flick him in the back of the head three
times.

01:37:19.741 --> 01:37:22.042
LIAM: I said one or two, I don't know what that
means.

01:37:22.042 --> 01:37:26.117
SAM: I'll gently tap you twice.

01:37:26.117 --> 01:37:27.649
LIAM: What are we doing?

01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:30.568
TALIESIN: Based on that description I want to see
if I can figure out what buildings would be

01:37:30.568 --> 01:37:36.678
directly underneath, do my own mental map of what
has been described.

01:37:36.678 --> 01:37:38.017
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:37:38.017 --> 01:37:38.730
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

01:37:38.730 --> 01:37:41.103
TRAVIS: 40 down, 40 across, 30 up.

01:37:41.103 --> 01:37:42.373
TALIESIN: Make an intelligence check?

01:37:42.373 --> 01:37:43.103
MATT: Yeah.

01:37:43.103 --> 01:37:44.918
TALIESIN: All right, that will be fun.

01:37:44.918 --> 01:37:45.660
TALIESIN: 14.

01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:53.796
MATT: It's probably a little over 100 feet beyond
where you are now, though you are probably in the

01:37:53.796 --> 01:37:59.351
boat about 15 or 20 feet back. So it's about 125,
130 feet. Which you couldn't-- because it's 100

01:37:59.351 --> 01:38:00.601
foot range for to--

01:38:00.601 --> 01:38:02.202
LIAM: Pull him back?

01:38:02.202 --> 01:38:03.248
MATT: To pull him back yeah.

01:38:03.248 --> 01:38:07.486
LIAM: Then I would tell him then to swim back. If
we, in our game, are allowing connection as long

01:38:07.486 --> 01:38:09.561
as it's not broken, I would just tell him to come
back.

01:38:09.561 --> 01:38:13.416
MATT: Okay, cool. So you are fine. Best you can
tell over there it looks like some sort of

01:38:13.416 --> 01:38:18.391
warehouse. It's a larger storage building, it's
not remarkable in its design or decor.

01:38:18.391 --> 01:38:22.761
TALIESIN: Maybe that thing is, maybe directly on
top of what you were looking at.

01:38:22.761 --> 01:38:24.404
SAM: I think that's a great idea.

01:38:24.404 --> 01:38:27.578
TRAVIS: I think that's a good place to start.
However, if you wanted to test your strength I

01:38:27.578 --> 01:38:33.578
would be very careful! Remember it was an intake,
so you could get down there and all of a sudden

01:38:33.578 --> 01:38:36.590
the suction and the water would make it very
difficult for you to back out.

01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:38.696
LAURA: Well Frumpkin wasn't getting sucked in, was
he?

01:38:38.696 --> 01:38:41.938
TRAVIS: I'm just saying it could be unpredictable.
It could turn on, turn off.

01:38:41.938 --> 01:38:45.423
ASHLEY: I'm okay with unpredictable.

01:38:45.423 --> 01:38:52.445
LIAM: I mean, I could also if we want to hang a
little longer I can just send him. You know I

01:38:52.445 --> 01:38:55.553
don't want him to be squished but I can send him
as far as he can go to see what he hits. It's up

01:38:55.553 --> 01:38:56.159
to you.

01:38:56.159 --> 01:38:58.430
LAURA: No! I want to go try to break through the
grate.

01:38:58.430 --> 01:39:00.617
TRAVIS: Okay, who is going down?

01:39:00.617 --> 01:39:01.717
SAM: The strongs.

01:39:01.717 --> 01:39:03.207
MARISHA: I'll hold a rope.

01:39:03.207 --> 01:39:07.689
ASHLEY: Can you keep him down there just to watch
us?

01:39:07.849 --> 01:39:14.803
LIAM: Yeah, of course. Frumpkin is now like a
backpack on Yasha's back.

01:39:14.836 --> 01:39:18.317
MATT: The tentacles wrap over the shoulders and
underneath.

01:39:18.317 --> 01:39:22.386
LAURA: Hold on to Spr-- Oh! I can't do it.

01:39:22.386 --> 01:39:23.175
SAM: What?

01:39:23.175 --> 01:39:25.126
LAURA: I'm afraid you are going to eat my weasel.

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:28.721
SAM: No! I had a lot of seagulls yesterday for
dinner, I'm very full still.

01:39:28.721 --> 01:39:30.651
LAURA: You promise me you won't eat him?

01:39:30.651 --> 01:39:32.430
LIAM: That really sounds like a euphemism.

01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:33.255
TRAVIS: Yeah it does.

01:39:33.255 --> 01:39:35.120
SAM: I will not eat your weasel.

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.566
TRAVIS: What about the damn puppy?

01:39:36.566 --> 01:39:39.056
MATT: The puppy is in the boat like (panting,
barks).

01:39:39.056 --> 01:39:40.976
LAURA: Don't eat the puppy either. Promise.

01:39:40.976 --> 01:39:41.795
SAM: Too bony.

01:39:41.795 --> 01:39:43.693
LAURA: Promise?

01:39:43.693 --> 01:39:47.381
SAM: Too bony. Promise.

01:39:50.841 --> 01:39:52.398
LAURA: No, Nott!

01:39:52.398 --> 01:39:58.005
(laughter)

01:39:58.005 --> 01:39:59.168
LAURA: You promised me.

01:39:59.168 --> 01:40:02.903
SAM: I promise I will not eat your weasel today.

01:40:02.903 --> 01:40:04.344
LAURA: Okay.

01:40:04.344 --> 01:40:06.568
TRAVIS: Beau's holding onto a lead line.

01:40:06.568 --> 01:40:07.813
LAURA: Let's go!

01:40:07.813 --> 01:40:10.131
TRAVIS: Big breath. (deep inhale)

01:40:10.131 --> 01:40:13.857
MATT: The three of you dive down. Which one of you
has the lead line?

01:40:13.857 --> 01:40:14.513
MARISHA: Me.

01:40:14.513 --> 01:40:16.385
MATT: Who has the other end of it?

01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:17.680
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:23.300
MATT: Fjord has it. You guys all dive down, taking
a breath, pushing through the seaweed until

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:29.547
eventually you come to the base of where that tube
is. A few feet into it, you see the grate, and

01:40:29.547 --> 01:40:34.883
it's about roughly four and a half, five-foot
diameter so you have to crouch down, but you can

01:40:34.883 --> 01:40:36.880
get a hold on this.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:42.403
LAURA: Oh yeah, let's get a hand on it and brace
our feet against the tunnel and on the count of--

01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:49.348
MATT: All right. One of you roll with advantage or
you both roll independently.

01:40:49.348 --> 01:40:51.580
LAURA: It was a practice count! What'd he say?

01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:54.587
ASHLEY: Do you want to roll? He said roll with
advantage or roll independently.

01:40:54.587 --> 01:40:55.638
LAURA: Let's roll independently.

01:40:55.638 --> 01:40:57.633
ASHLEY: This is a strength check?

01:40:57.633 --> 01:41:02.475
LIAM: While they're rolling, I grab Nott's
shoulder and turn on the Jacques Cousteau camera

01:41:02.475 --> 01:41:03.818
on Yasha's back.

01:41:03.818 --> 01:41:04.422
SAM: Ooh.

01:41:04.422 --> 01:41:05.863
ASHLEY: 20.

01:41:05.863 --> 01:41:07.047
MATT: 20?

01:41:07.047 --> 01:41:08.041
ASHLEY: Not a natural 20.

01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:09.066
MATT: Right, but 20 total?

01:41:09.066 --> 01:41:09.747
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:41:09.747 --> 01:41:11.283
MATT: That's the DC you needed.

01:41:11.283 --> 01:41:12.585
TRAVIS: Oh shit, really?

01:41:12.585 --> 01:41:18.630
MATT: Yeah, so you both are holding on and
pulling. You get your foot in some of the

01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:23.207
imperfect stonework where elements of the masonry
pokes out which gives you a foot groove and one

01:41:23.207 --> 01:41:28.272
part where some of the stone had been rotted away
and that's just enough of a point to lock yourself

01:41:28.272 --> 01:41:38.623
in. As you pull, you feel (shifting) and
eventually it comes out of its mooring on the wall

01:41:38.623 --> 01:41:43.528
and then slides off to the side. You rotate it a
bit and it comes to rest in the middle of it.

01:41:43.528 --> 01:41:45.154
MARISHA: That is the coolest!

01:41:45.154 --> 01:41:45.897
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:41:45.897 --> 01:41:47.658
LAURA: (pointedly humming)

01:41:47.658 --> 01:41:48.561
MARISHA: Oh!

01:41:48.561 --> 01:41:51.031
MATT: So you guys go ahead and come back onto it
again.

01:41:51.031 --> 01:41:53.415
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out.

01:41:53.415 --> 01:41:55.617
TRAVIS: Did not think that was going to work.

01:41:55.617 --> 01:41:57.139
ASHLEY: I didn't either, but it's open.

01:41:57.139 --> 01:41:57.904
MARISHA: What?!

01:41:57.904 --> 01:41:59.095
ASHLEY: At least one of them.

01:41:59.095 --> 01:41:59.682
SAM: Amazing!

01:41:59.682 --> 01:42:00.941
LAURA: She's really strong.

01:42:00.941 --> 01:42:05.306
MARISHA: Okay, here's my other question, though:
can we hold our breath that long?

01:42:05.306 --> 01:42:09.664
LAURA: Did it seem like it was hard to hold our
breath while we were doing all of that?

01:42:09.664 --> 01:42:14.066
MATT: Well, you guys all have pretty high
constitutions, so not really.

01:42:14.066 --> 01:42:15.858
ASHLEY: Should we try the other one?

01:42:15.858 --> 01:42:17.890
LAURA: Yeah, let's try the other one!

01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:22.028
MATT: It works out, just so you guys know, your
constitution modifier is how many minutes you can

01:42:22.028 --> 01:42:23.576
hold your breath underwater.

01:42:23.576 --> 01:42:25.281
TRAVIS: Damn!

01:42:25.281 --> 01:42:27.533
LAURA: Really?

01:42:27.533 --> 01:42:29.121
TRAVIS: David Blaine up in this bitch.

01:42:29.121 --> 01:42:31.646
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm all right, too. That's cool.

01:42:31.646 --> 01:42:35.895
TRAVIS: Make a summer home underwater.

01:42:35.895 --> 01:42:38.298
LIAM: My constitution must be low, mine's three.

01:42:38.298 --> 01:42:43.189
TRAVIS: My swim speed is my regular speed.

01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:46.054
SAM: Our swim speed is half?

01:42:46.054 --> 01:42:48.848
MATT: Actually, technically, it's one plus your
constitution modifier, so it's even more.

01:42:48.848 --> 01:42:57.039
LAURA: Ooh, nice! Okay, we try to go to the second
one and break through. Okay, so this time, I'll be

01:42:57.039 --> 01:43:03.195
more specific. I'll go hm, hm, hm, and then we
pull it! Yeah, one, two, three, pull!

01:43:03.195 --> 01:43:05.607
ASHLEY: We're pulling down right after three.

01:43:05.607 --> 01:43:07.170
LAURA: Yeah. One, two, three, pull!

01:43:07.170 --> 01:43:09.918
MARISHA: So you guys are going to go down and come
back up again, and then we'll all go?

01:43:09.918 --> 01:43:12.539
TRAVIS: I'm staying at the mouth with the other
end of the rope. You guys are going in.

01:43:12.539 --> 01:43:16.434
MARISHA: Hopefully the rope can go this far? How
long is this rope?

01:43:16.434 --> 01:43:24.904
MATT: The rope you found here? It's probably 60 to
70 feet at most.

01:43:24.904 --> 01:43:27.241
TRAVIS: That's why I'm at the mouth of the--

01:43:27.241 --> 01:43:29.047
MARISHA: Tie it up to the mouth of the grate.

01:43:29.047 --> 01:43:30.520
TRAVIS: They can just come up it, yeah.

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.194
MARISHA: Okay.

01:43:31.194 --> 01:43:34.574
MATT: All right, you do that. You guys all jump
back in a second time?

01:43:34.574 --> 01:43:35.399
LAURA: Yeah.

01:43:35.399 --> 01:43:41.897
MATT: You dive back down below, pushing through
the darker depths of the bay, eventually finding

01:43:41.897 --> 01:43:47.160
yourselves back to the tunnel where the grate has
been shifted to the side. So now you have, at an

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.055
angle underneath, you can swim over or under it.
You guys pincer off of it, taking two different

01:43:51.055 --> 01:43:56.458
directions, and meeting on the opposite side. You
go a few more lengths before the tunnel shifts

01:43:56.458 --> 01:44:03.172
upward. You both have darkvision, if I recall?
Good, because there was no light source in the

01:44:03.172 --> 01:44:08.532
water, beyond just the distant glow and shifting
of the sunlight through the water. You make your

01:44:08.532 --> 01:44:16.494
way back up, and you find the grate above you.
This area, the footholds aren't as easy because

01:44:16.494 --> 01:44:23.585
it's not quite as close to the elements, so the
DC's a little higher, but if you guys grab hold,

01:44:23.585 --> 01:44:25.209
you can go ahead and make a check.

01:44:25.209 --> 01:44:30.107
MARISHA: High, come on, you guys. Oh my goodness.

01:44:30.107 --> 01:44:32.009
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:44:32.009 --> 01:44:37.108
(cheering)

01:44:37.108 --> 01:44:38.598
MARISHA: Fuck yes, Jester!

01:44:38.598 --> 01:44:39.514
ASHLEY: I got a ten.

01:44:39.514 --> 01:44:43.104
MATT: That with your modifier is a 23?

01:44:43.104 --> 01:44:44.053
LAURA: 23.

01:44:44.053 --> 01:44:50.058
MATT: 23, okay! You both hold on this time. You're
having a hard time getting any sort of a foothold

01:44:50.058 --> 01:44:58.207
into the space. Jester, you angrily look down and
taking your elbow, you jam a section of the stone

01:44:58.207 --> 01:45:01.081
until it breaks off and you find a section of--

01:45:01.081 --> 01:45:03.433
LAURA: Hot. I say about myself.

01:45:03.433 --> 01:45:08.808
MATT: Noticing this Yasha, you do the same and
smash. You guys actually break a few footholds

01:45:08.808 --> 01:45:13.781
into the side of this tunnel. Once you're set into
place, you look at each other, count to the right

01:45:13.781 --> 01:45:20.556
moment and pull! I mean, you've seen Jester do
some cool stuff, but in that moment it's a Rosie Riveter--

01:45:21.103 --> 01:45:22.306
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:45:22.306 --> 01:45:28.508
MATT: Muscle moment-- as guns going, the metal
bars bend slightly (metal creak). From underneath

01:45:28.508 --> 01:45:33.057
the water, you hear the echo and then it comes
loose from the mooring and begins sinking down

01:45:33.057 --> 01:45:37.596
towards both of you. The heavy metal is now
sandwiching you guys towards the bottom and you

01:45:37.596 --> 01:45:42.151
push off and manage to get it to rotate and you
swim around it without having an issue.

01:45:42.151 --> 01:45:43.162
LAURA: Up and up?

01:45:43.162 --> 01:45:43.791
MATT: Yep.

01:45:43.791 --> 01:45:45.073
LAURA: Up and breathe!

01:45:45.073 --> 01:45:48.788
MATT: You guys make it to the surface (splash)
(sharp inhale) and you're now inside the tunnel.

01:45:48.788 --> 01:45:50.246
It's strangely--

01:45:50.246 --> 01:45:51.452
ASHLEY: Jester, you are very strong.

01:45:51.452 --> 01:45:52.950
LAURA: So are you!

01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:55.965
ASHLEY: Man we're like a strong couple of women!

01:45:55.965 --> 01:46:00.005
(laughter)

01:46:00.005 --> 01:46:02.545
ASHLEY: Okay, let's see what is out here.

01:46:02.545 --> 01:46:04.908
MARISHA: Oh man, we're like a strong couple of
women.

01:46:04.908 --> 01:46:09.517
TRAVIS: Since I saw them go up, I'm going to swim
forward to where I saw them disappear, and seeing

01:46:09.517 --> 01:46:12.757
the grate gone, I'm going to come back out and
make my way up towards the boat to let them know

01:46:12.757 --> 01:46:13.859
they made it through.

01:46:13.859 --> 01:46:16.018
MATT: Okay, you guys watch as Fjord breaks the
surface without the other two.

01:46:16.018 --> 01:46:17.086
SAM: Are they alive?

01:46:17.086 --> 01:46:18.657
TRAVIS: Yeah, they made it through the second
grate.

01:46:18.657 --> 01:46:19.288
SAM: Oh!

01:46:19.288 --> 01:46:21.467
LIAM: Yeah, just like I told you, they made it
through the second grate.

01:46:21.467 --> 01:46:22.591
SAM: Oh, because you can see.

01:46:22.591 --> 01:46:26.602
LIAM: I can see.

01:46:26.602 --> 01:46:28.085
TRAVIS: Oh, why am I even coming back? (inhale)
(splash)

01:46:28.085 --> 01:46:29.670
MARISHA: I dive in and follow.

01:46:29.670 --> 01:46:30.759
MATT: All right.

01:46:30.759 --> 01:46:32.990
TALIESIN: Are we just leaving a boat here, is that
the--.

01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:34.008
LAURA: Oh, well that'll totally--

01:46:34.008 --> 01:46:35.932
SAM: No, don't worry, I'll take it back to the
shore for us in stealth.

01:46:35.932 --> 01:46:38.655
TRAVIS: The bottom rope is tied to the bottom so
if you tie the rope to the boat, you got yourself

01:46:38.655 --> 01:46:40.294
an anchor or a moor.

01:46:40.294 --> 01:46:42.941
MARISHA: You guys want to try and meet us where
that pillar is?

01:46:42.941 --> 01:46:46.685
SAM: Sure! I'll go to the warehouse and try to
break in.

01:46:46.685 --> 01:46:48.270
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:49.744
TALIESIN: No.

01:46:49.744 --> 01:46:51.125
MARISHA: Sounds terrible.

01:46:51.125 --> 01:46:54.750
LIAM: I think it's a better idea for us to stay
together. Nott, you know this is a recurring thing

01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:57.947
and I think we should-- what is going on? What is
this?

01:46:57.947 --> 01:46:59.696
SAM: I don't like water.

01:46:59.696 --> 01:47:02.275
LIAM: Yeah, but what if we need to go through
water?

01:47:02.275 --> 01:47:04.593
SAM: Mostly we don't. We don't live near the
ocean.

01:47:04.593 --> 01:47:08.006
LIAM: Mostly, but right now we need to.

01:47:10.726 --> 01:47:17.236
SAM: It's not-- I don't. (sigh)

01:47:17.236 --> 01:47:20.828
LIAM: Let me make a suggestion. And I cast
Suggestion.

01:47:20.828 --> 01:47:22.231
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:26.029
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yes! Break through that shit!

01:47:26.029 --> 01:47:27.389
TALIESIN: Better than what I was going to do.

01:47:27.389 --> 01:47:28.634
TRAVIS: Woo!

01:47:28.634 --> 01:47:34.898
LIAM: I think you should just try it one time and
see how it goes, and if it goes well then we know

01:47:34.898 --> 01:47:36.548
that you are good for the future.

01:47:36.548 --> 01:47:38.597
TRAVIS: (creepy voice) Try it, you might like it.

01:47:38.597 --> 01:47:43.379
MATT: I would like you to make a wisdom saving
throw, Nott, please.

01:47:45.829 --> 01:47:46.509
SAM: Three.

01:47:46.509 --> 01:47:47.724
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:47:47.724 --> 01:47:49.875
(laughter and cheers)

01:47:49.875 --> 01:47:53.987
MATT: Your fear subside momentarily and you find
yourself instinctually nodding as you know what,

01:47:53.987 --> 01:47:58.863
maybe trying it once and seeing how it goes is
exactly what Caleb would want.

01:47:58.863 --> 01:48:07.394
SAM: Yes, well, you do know best Caleb. All right,
this sounds like a good idea.

01:48:07.394 --> 01:48:08.272
LIAM: Yeah we are--

01:48:08.272 --> 01:48:10.067
MARISHA: You want to dolphin ride my back?

01:48:10.067 --> 01:48:12.083
SAM: Sure-- are you a good swimmer?

01:48:12.083 --> 01:48:14.599
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm all right.

01:48:14.599 --> 01:48:15.954
SAM: All right?

01:48:15.954 --> 01:48:20.043
MARISHA: I mean I might not be Fjord levels but
yeah I can swim.

01:48:20.043 --> 01:48:23.537
LIAM: And all she does is eat fish and do
push-ups, I think she'll be good underwater.

01:48:23.537 --> 01:48:32.941
SAM: I'm going to take a big swig of whiskey and
climb on Beau's back. (sigh) All right dolphin

01:48:32.941 --> 01:48:34.303
lady, ride me.

01:48:34.303 --> 01:48:37.896
(laughter)

01:48:37.896 --> 01:48:38.689
SAM: Sorry.

01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:39.904
MARISHA: It's the other way--

01:48:39.904 --> 01:48:41.486
LIAM: It's the booze talking.

01:48:41.486 --> 01:48:47.855
MARISHA: Yeah, all right. I wait... Deuces, you
coming in?

01:48:47.855 --> 01:48:48.995
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

01:48:48.995 --> 01:48:52.464
SAM: All right mermaid, scale me down.

01:48:52.464 --> 01:48:57.598
MARISHA: Yep, that whiskey's working. Ready? We're
going to do this together.

01:48:57.598 --> 01:49:01.545
MARISHA AND SAM: (breathing heavily)

01:49:01.545 --> 01:49:04.874
MARISHA: One, two, three and we go.

01:49:04.874 --> 01:49:06.740
SAM: (squealing)

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:08.182
MATT: (splash) Going under water, you hear the--

01:49:08.182 --> 01:49:11.274
SAM: (still squealing)

01:49:11.274 --> 01:49:17.260
MATT: The diminishing squeak as it slowly vanishes
beneath the surface. Caduceus and Caleb sitting up

01:49:17.588 --> 01:49:22.358
in the ship with a weasel and a puppy.

01:49:23.779 --> 01:49:25.732
LAURA: Oh no, the animals!

01:49:25.732 --> 01:49:27.609
SAM: I'm holding the weasel!

01:49:27.609 --> 01:49:29.583
LAURA: Oh god! No, it's going to die!

01:49:29.583 --> 01:49:31.522
TRAVIS: We got to get rid of them at some point!

01:49:31.522 --> 01:49:32.823
LAURA: No! I don't want it to die!

01:49:32.823 --> 01:49:34.911
TRAVIS: Let it happen! Let it happen!

01:49:34.911 --> 01:49:37.943
(laughter)

01:49:37.943 --> 01:49:42.967
MATT: So, as Beau swims-- now Beau, go ahead and
make an athletics check for me because you are

01:49:42.967 --> 01:49:45.626
technically carrying two passengers.

01:49:45.626 --> 01:49:47.742
MARISHA: That weasel is about to die!

01:49:47.742 --> 01:49:50.160
ASHLEY: Oh, my god.

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.635
MARISHA: An athletics check?

01:49:51.635 --> 01:49:54.371
LAURA: And the dog is just on the boat!

01:49:54.371 --> 01:49:55.742
MARISHA: Is that cocked?

01:49:55.742 --> 01:49:56.788
SAM: That's a little cocked.

01:49:56.788 --> 01:49:58.681
MATT: It's a little cocked.

01:49:58.681 --> 01:50:00.029
MARISHA: I can do the balance thing.

01:50:00.029 --> 01:50:01.301
LIAM: It's technically, it's slightly cocked.

01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:02.500
MATT: Yeah, that counts.

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.223
MARISHA: Counts?

01:50:03.223 --> 01:50:04.263
LIAM: It is cocked.

01:50:04.263 --> 01:50:05.363
MARISHA: It's a good roll though.

01:50:05.363 --> 01:50:06.372
TRAVIS: It's cocked as fuck.

01:50:06.372 --> 01:50:07.898
MATT: No, if you can rest a d4 on it.

01:50:07.898 --> 01:50:08.846
MARISHA: It's the test.

01:50:08.846 --> 01:50:09.887
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's okay.

01:50:09.887 --> 01:50:10.508
MATT: Yeah.

01:50:10.508 --> 01:50:12.476
MARISHA: It's an okay roll. 21.

01:50:12.476 --> 01:50:17.521
MATT: Strongly pushing through, using the grate to
go ahead and pull yourself forward beneath the

01:50:17.521 --> 01:50:21.969
surface. You bring your goggles down so you can
actually see where you're going once the light

01:50:21.969 --> 01:50:25.886
begins to subside. You still hear in the water
above you (squeal).

01:50:25.886 --> 01:50:27.519
MARISHA: I totally forgot about the weasel by the
way.

01:50:27.519 --> 01:50:30.150
MATT: Oh, you don't even know. You know nothing
about it. You're just like "I got this." Swing

01:50:30.150 --> 01:50:36.268
upward, break the surface. (inhale) Come up from
the top and there you can see Yasha and Jester

01:50:36.268 --> 01:50:38.207
waiting for you, they are stepped up into the
tube.

01:50:38.207 --> 01:50:38.805
LAURA: Ay!

01:50:38.805 --> 01:50:39.511
ASHLEY: Nott!

01:50:39.511 --> 01:50:40.291
LAURA: You made it!

01:50:40.291 --> 01:50:42.669
SAM: (nervous laughter)

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:43.937
MARISHA: (out of breath) You did good.

01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:45.651
SAM: Wow, that was invigorating.

01:50:45.651 --> 01:50:51.497
MATT: You hear (coughing up water). You look down
as this waterlogged weasel is now like coughing

01:50:51.497 --> 01:50:52.648
and sneezing.

01:50:52.648 --> 01:50:54.205
LAURA: Ah! Sprinkle!

01:50:54.205 --> 01:51:02.448
MATT: It's awake and conscious. You're just
pushing on its chest.

01:51:02.448 --> 01:51:03.924
LAURA: Where's Nugget?

01:51:03.924 --> 01:51:07.865
SAM: I don't know. You didn't have me look after
Nugget.

01:51:07.865 --> 01:51:11.419
LIAM: So this is a bit of a problem because nobody
thought of the dog and that's why I knew it was a

01:51:11.419 --> 01:51:15.351
bad decision to purchase it in the first place.
Because now we are stuck with a dog. So what do we

01:51:15.351 --> 01:51:17.103
do Caduceus? What do you think?

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:18.876
MARISHA: Can we get the dog to blink to us?

01:51:18.876 --> 01:51:20.288
TRAVIS: No, don't do that, the dog will die.

01:51:20.288 --> 01:51:24.954
TALIESIN: See Nugget, here's the situation.
Everybody else is going into this thing in the

01:51:24.954 --> 01:51:29.341
tunnel. I don't know if you want to go into the
water, if you want to just hang out here and hope

01:51:29.341 --> 01:51:34.524
that everything goes okay or if you've got a
preference. But, I'll tell you what. You can hop

01:51:34.524 --> 01:51:37.796
on with me if want to go with us on this
adventure. If you'd rather just sit here, I'll

01:51:37.796 --> 01:51:41.246
leave you a little food and we'll probably be back
in a couple of hours.

01:51:41.246 --> 01:51:42.913
LIAM: You're speaking in Sylvan, correct?

01:51:42.913 --> 01:51:43.828
TALIESIN: Yeah, of course.

01:51:43.828 --> 01:51:46.589
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> I'm listening in Sylvan.

01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:49.384
TALIESIN: So you just want to hang I guess?

01:51:49.384 --> 01:51:56.839
MATT: It's just sitting in the boat, looks over
the edge "(whining)."

01:51:56.839 --> 01:51:58.706
TALIESIN: You want to come with me?

01:51:58.706 --> 01:52:02.488
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Actually this would
be animal handling.

01:52:02.488 --> 01:52:03.762
TALIESIN: Animal handling?

01:52:03.762 --> 01:52:04.416
MATT: Yeah.

01:52:04.416 --> 01:52:08.594
TALIESIN: 20-- I'm sorry, not 20, 18.

01:52:08.594 --> 01:52:17.586
MATT: In your robes, there's a comfortable little
cradle that you form there and then (puppy

01:52:17.943 --> 01:52:23.607
whining) (poof) and then appears into the small
pocket in your arm.

01:52:23.607 --> 01:52:25.729
TALIESIN: Hold your breath on the count of three.

01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:33.580
LIAM: In Sylvan, Caleb says, If it goes wrong,
pup, you know, bamf out and in and maybe that'll

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:35.288
buy you a little more time.

01:52:35.288 --> 01:52:38.549
TALIESIN: Oh you'll be fine, we'll just give you a
little-- I can just give you a little tap if

01:52:38.549 --> 01:52:40.837
anything goes wrong.

01:52:40.837 --> 01:52:43.326
LIAM: I don't care, let's go. (splash)

01:52:43.326 --> 01:52:47.580
TALIESIN: I'm going to slow my breathing, I'm
going to take one last look around to see if

01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:49.902
anyone notices any of the commotion that we're
causing.

01:52:49.902 --> 01:52:50.827
MATT: Perception check.

01:52:50.827 --> 01:52:51.577
TALIESIN: Perception check.

01:52:51.577 --> 01:52:53.444
LAURA: I really should have left the puppy with my
mom.

01:52:53.444 --> 01:52:59.492
TALIESIN: Yeah, my perception check was bad for
me, which is an 11.

01:52:59.492 --> 01:53:05.220
MATT: Looking around, no one, in particular, seems
to be paying much mind to what your business is.

01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:10.254
TALIESIN: I've slowed my breathing, I've calmed
myself and I'm just going to take a very gentle

01:53:10.254 --> 01:53:11.105
dive and move in.

01:53:11.105 --> 01:53:12.522
LAURA: And we tied the boat, yeah?

01:53:12.522 --> 01:53:13.330
MARISHA: I think so.

01:53:13.330 --> 01:53:14.484
TALIESIN: Yeah, we tied the boat.

01:53:14.484 --> 01:53:18.797
MATT: I will ask you to make an athletics check
because you are swimming mostly with one arm and

01:53:18.797 --> 01:53:22.078
your legs, as you are cradling the puppy with the
other.

01:53:22.078 --> 01:53:26.909
TALIESIN: Athletics check, that one was not so
good.

01:53:26.909 --> 01:53:29.916
(laughter)

01:53:29.916 --> 01:53:30.951
TALIESIN: That's a three.

01:53:30.951 --> 01:53:32.324
LIAM: Oh!

01:53:32.324 --> 01:53:40.878
MATT: (exertion noises) You make your way, partway
through the tunnel and under the grate. You get

01:53:40.878 --> 01:53:42.655
past that point, look up, you push off.

01:53:42.655 --> 01:53:43.302
LAURA: Oh god!

01:53:43.302 --> 01:53:48.103
MATT: You're tired, your lungs are starting to
hurt from just the amount of effort it's taking to

01:53:48.103 --> 01:53:55.627
go this distance with one arm and your legs
kicking. You've waded in the ponds near the graveyard--

01:53:55.627 --> 01:53:56.931
TALIESIN: Never done this before.

01:53:56.931 --> 01:53:58.066
MATT: You're not a practiced swimmer.

01:53:58.213 --> 01:54:00.477
MARISHA: Yeah do you have hooves?

01:54:00.477 --> 01:54:03.305
TALIESIN: I can thankfully hold my breath a long
time.

01:54:03.305 --> 01:54:05.088
MATT: Correct, the puppy though--

01:54:05.088 --> 01:54:09.172
TALIESIN: The puppy is having-- am I feeling a
twitch, or is it having a--?

01:54:09.172 --> 01:54:11.214
MATT: Not yet, no. Make another athletics check--

01:54:11.214 --> 01:54:13.275
MATT: For the second half of this journey.

01:54:13.275 --> 01:54:16.414
TALIESIN: Oh that's better, 18.

01:54:16.414 --> 01:54:24.319
MATT: Okay! Yeah, you get down low to the bottom
of it and push upward. Right at that moment, you

01:54:24.319 --> 01:54:29.505
see this little burst of bubble (poof) in your
arm, just as you're about to break the surface. You

01:54:29.505 --> 01:54:36.230
look down, frightened, and he's not there and as
you look up, break the surface (inhale) come up

01:54:36.230 --> 01:54:38.155
and you watch as (poof) in the air--

01:54:38.155 --> 01:54:39.519
MARISHA AND LAURA: Yay!

01:54:39.519 --> 01:54:45.871
MATT: You catch Nugget (panting). Just
waterlogged, dripping.

01:54:45.871 --> 01:54:47.643
TRAVIS: You brought the dog?

01:54:47.643 --> 01:54:49.684
LAURA: Yay Nugget!

01:54:49.684 --> 01:54:51.239
TALIESIN: He wanted to come.

01:54:51.239 --> 01:54:56.378
MARISHA: Holy shit, the dog and the weasel
survived. A hundred foot swim underwater.

01:54:56.378 --> 01:54:59.249
LAURA: We have really good pets.

01:54:59.249 --> 01:55:02.163
SAM: Are we all here? Caleb, are you here?

01:55:02.163 --> 01:55:07.458
MATT: The weasel looks miserable. Sprinkle is just
like (snarling)

01:55:07.458 --> 01:55:09.593
LAURA: I'll put him in my hood and stuff and warm
up.

01:55:09.593 --> 01:55:11.556
MATT: He curls up in there.

01:55:11.556 --> 01:55:12.472
TRAVIS: Where's Caleb?

01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:16.149
LIAM: Yeah I'm here. I would have beat Caduceus
here, because he was struggling. I'm so proud of

01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:18.381
you! You made it all this way.

01:55:18.381 --> 01:55:26.125
SAM: I just had a feeling overcome me, that I
was-- I've never done anything like that before.

01:55:26.125 --> 01:55:29.376
LIAM: Do you know what the good news is? You're
going to have that feeling for the next seven

01:55:29.376 --> 01:55:30.771
hours and 50 minutes.

01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:34.067
SAM: It's not real, is it?

01:55:34.067 --> 01:55:36.989
(laughing)

01:55:36.989 --> 01:55:39.257
LIAM: Make an insight check.

01:55:39.257 --> 01:55:43.720
(laughter)

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.145
SAM: I'll just start drinking.

01:55:45.145 --> 01:55:54.090
MATT: You're all clustered up in this small
tunnel. It's maybe eight feet across, and it's

01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:57.154
cylindrical in its shape.

01:55:57.154 --> 01:55:59.814
TALIESIN: I'll look around.

01:56:00.113 --> 01:56:03.088
MATT: About a foot and a half of water, depending
upon where you're standing in it, and it continues

01:56:03.088 --> 01:56:05.023
down, dark into the next chamber.

01:56:05.023 --> 01:56:07.604
LAURA: What if the water comes in while we're in
here?

01:56:07.604 --> 01:56:08.747
TRAVIS: That'd be bad.

01:56:08.747 --> 01:56:10.287
LAURA: We should probably hurry up then, huh?

01:56:10.287 --> 01:56:14.905
LIAM: Also, there is a small grate just down here.
Frumpkin was not able to get through it, but maybe

01:56:14.905 --> 01:56:17.012
one of you two ladies could bust that open.

01:56:17.012 --> 01:56:18.232
LAURA: We could try.

01:56:18.232 --> 01:56:20.279
ASHLEY: Yeah. We could give it a go.

01:56:20.279 --> 01:56:21.396
TRAVIS: It's only about a foot and a half across,
right?

01:56:21.396 --> 01:56:22.886
LIAM: It's right over there.

01:56:22.886 --> 01:56:27.406
TALIESIN: Let's head quietly in that direction I
think might be--

01:56:27.406 --> 01:56:28.346
MARISHA: But then what?

01:56:28.346 --> 01:56:29.529
SAM: Frumpkin!

01:56:29.529 --> 01:56:30.861
LIAM: Octopus.

01:56:30.861 --> 01:56:32.071
MATT: Do you point out the grate to them?

01:56:32.071 --> 01:56:33.142
LIAM: Yeah, I did.

01:56:33.142 --> 01:56:41.022
MATT: As you guys have moved through the tunnel,
into the small chamber break in the tunnel path

01:56:41.022 --> 01:56:46.028
there with the pillar, Caleb points over to the
grate, and you can see it's a pretty dense lattice

01:56:46.028 --> 01:56:47.022
of metal.

01:56:47.022 --> 01:56:48.524
LAURA: Can we get our fingers in?

01:56:48.524 --> 01:56:51.590
MATT: Yeah, you can get your fingers in. There's
enough space there to get your fingers in more.

01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:55.198
Each bar is about two inches apart from each
other.

01:56:55.198 --> 01:56:56.163
TRAVIS: Thunder queens.

01:56:56.163 --> 01:56:57.118
LAURA: Let's try it.

01:56:57.118 --> 01:56:58.035
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

01:56:58.035 --> 01:56:59.277
LAURA: Can we try to bust it out?

01:56:59.277 --> 01:57:02.820
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make another strength
check. The beast team here.

01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:07.295
LAURA: Nine.

01:57:07.295 --> 01:57:08.402
ASHLEY: 12.

01:57:08.402 --> 01:57:14.358
MATT: (exertion noise) You get the sense-- first
off, your fingers are sore and your arms are

01:57:14.358 --> 01:57:20.100
strained from the two previous exerts that you've
given. And you've done impressive things, but you

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:24.879
get the sense that this is probably-- because it's
smaller, it's wedged into a little tighter in the

01:57:24.879 --> 01:57:29.317
small tunnel. The actual tunnel there is maybe
about a foot across, a foot and a half across.

01:57:29.317 --> 01:57:35.097
Most of you would not even fit through it, but
you're unable to get it to budge at all.

01:57:35.097 --> 01:57:36.915
LAURA: Can we see through it at all? What's in
there?

01:57:36.915 --> 01:57:38.797
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:57:38.797 --> 01:57:42.706
TRAVIS: As they're looking, I'll just creep
towards the pillar and cautiously peek around.

01:57:43.693 --> 01:57:46.779
TALIESIN: Is this a fancy room or is this just a
more of a--

01:57:46.779 --> 01:57:54.890
MATT: Looking around, it resembles a subterranean
sewer, it's mostly just stone and masonry that's

01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:59.782
slick from the moisture. And the air itself is
very humid down here. There is a lot of moisture

01:57:59.782 --> 01:58:04.524
that gathers across the stone, and there's streaks
of color and minerals that have gathered on the

01:58:04.524 --> 01:58:09.244
walls over time. You still have the taste of the
brine in your mouth from your time under the

01:58:09.244 --> 01:58:13.202
ocean, but the air in here is still also very
ocean-like and salty.

01:58:13.202 --> 01:58:19.293
LAURA: Does it seem like water is ever up along
the walls, or does it seem like the water is

01:58:19.293 --> 01:58:20.682
always at the level it's at?

01:58:20.682 --> 01:58:22.447
MATT: Make an investigation check..

01:58:22.447 --> 01:58:30.326
MARISHA: While she does that, can I look and see
if there's any writing on the wall?

01:58:30.326 --> 01:58:31.419
LAURA: 18.

01:58:31.419 --> 01:58:36.764
MATT: Looking at it, there are certain markers and
the levels that say that there have at times been

01:58:36.764 --> 01:58:45.621
different levels of water in here, but it doesn't
seem often enough, like certain levels of minerals

01:58:45.621 --> 01:58:51.707
and sediment that you can see. But a lot of them
seem older, and haven't been reached in a while.

01:58:51.707 --> 01:58:53.303
LAURA: Okay, I think we're safe.

01:58:53.303 --> 01:58:54.990
MATT: You're looking for writing? You don't see
any writing.

01:58:54.990 --> 01:59:00.733
MARISHA: No type of directional marks? Any type
of, using my background, any types of Thieves'

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:02.106
Cant for smuggling?

01:59:02.106 --> 01:59:03.775
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:59:03.775 --> 01:59:06.484
MARISHA: Fuck you Gil, you haven't been good to me
today.

01:59:06.484 --> 01:59:08.827
MATT: Good to you in the past, but not tonight
apparently.

01:59:08.827 --> 01:59:09.694
MARISHA: You said perception?

01:59:09.694 --> 01:59:10.682
MATT: Yeah.

01:59:10.682 --> 01:59:12.230
MARISHA: 20 total.

01:59:12.230 --> 01:59:18.464
MATT: Looking around you don't see any markings in
the stonework, but as you go across the pillar in

01:59:18.464 --> 01:59:25.138
the center, looking for any sort of details, you
hear this faint-- almost like the sound of a

01:59:25.138 --> 01:59:31.534
crashing wave and the rushing of water, and you
glance around the edge, and in the corner you can

01:59:31.534 --> 01:59:36.437
see the water that previously was just moving from
your breaking the surface moving through, has

01:59:36.437 --> 01:59:44.143
started to-- (fwoosh) almost like it's forming a
small, occasional whirlpool, and then comes to

01:59:44.143 --> 01:59:45.515
rest for a moment and then--

01:59:45.515 --> 01:59:47.188
MARISHA: Hey Fjord?

01:59:47.188 --> 01:59:48.159
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:59:48.159 --> 01:59:50.224
MARISHA: Is it about time for high tide?

01:59:50.224 --> 01:59:51.965
TRAVIS: Is it?

01:59:51.965 --> 01:59:52.993
MATT: No.

01:59:52.993 --> 01:59:56.460
TRAVIS: No, that would have passed by now because
it's past midday, right?

01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:57.085
MATT: Yeah.

01:59:57.085 --> 02:00:01.735
LIAM: While they're discussing, I point at
Frumpkin on Yasha's back and snap him out and then

02:00:01.735 --> 02:00:06.999
submerge myself by that small grate and look and
keep my hand above the water, and snap again and

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:10.061
Frumpkin is past the gate on the other side of
it.

02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:14.880
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin-- the tunnel?

02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:18.092
LIAM: The small grate that we couldn't get open,
so he's on the other side.

02:00:18.092 --> 02:00:21.521
MATT: Okay, Frumpkin has appeared on the other
side. While this is happening, you watch as the

02:00:21.787 --> 02:00:29.549
small whirlpool begins to gather up and rise above
the surface in what is a roughly basketball-sized

02:00:29.549 --> 02:00:32.767
swirl of water. Like an inverse whirlpool.

02:00:32.767 --> 02:00:37.586
MARISHA: I really feel like this is like something
and it might attack us, and it might kill us. I

02:00:37.586 --> 02:00:39.223
don't know, maybe--

02:00:39.223 --> 02:00:42.991
MATT: A second one begins to emerge from the water
behind you.

02:00:42.991 --> 02:00:43.930
SAM: What is going on?

02:00:43.930 --> 02:00:44.632
MARISHA: Mighty Nein!

02:00:44.632 --> 02:00:46.382
TRAVIS: Is it spheres?

02:00:46.382 --> 02:00:49.942
MATT: They're essentially looking at reverse
whirlpools that are rising up out of the water,

02:00:49.942 --> 02:00:53.942
coming to a point as the water seems to be almost
guiding itself.

02:00:54.364 --> 02:00:56.511
TRAVIS: Oh jesus, wide at the bottom, thin at the
top.

02:00:56.511 --> 02:00:59.963
MARISHA: I'm going to take my two shurikens and
(throwing noises) into one and see what happens.

02:00:59.963 --> 02:01:01.922
MATT: Okay. Roll for attack.

02:01:01.922 --> 02:01:05.303
MARISHA: From Kentucky, it's sure-ooh-ken.

02:01:05.303 --> 02:01:07.026
MATT: Roll for an attack.

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:09.056
MARISHA: For two? Both of them?

02:01:09.056 --> 02:01:09.845
MATT: Yep.

02:01:09.845 --> 02:01:19.478
MARISHA: That first one is an 18, so 25. And the
second one is 15.

02:01:19.478 --> 02:01:23.090
MATT: Both of them hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:27.434
MARISHA: Yeah, I think this is a thing. Like a
thing to kill.

02:01:27.434 --> 02:01:33.199
MATT: Before she even says that, roll some damage.
Because this is all happening very quickly.

02:01:33.199 --> 02:01:42.766
MARISHA: Nine-- sorry. 12. 13 total, 13.

02:01:42.766 --> 02:01:47.074
MATT: Quick, let me check one thing real fast.

02:01:47.074 --> 02:01:51.216
SAM: They are impervious to throwing star damage.

02:01:51.216 --> 02:01:58.140
LAURA: Oh no.

02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:02.916
MATT: No, okay. So, good to know. So it was nine
and--

02:02:02.916 --> 02:02:04.107
MARISHA: 13 total.

02:02:04.107 --> 02:02:12.585
MATT: Okay, got you. You watch as both enter the
water, and it seems to react, pull back and a

02:02:12.585 --> 02:02:19.517
spray of water hits the wall behind it. You watch
as it quivers and then suddenly you see these two

02:02:19.517 --> 02:02:24.654
large pseudopods of water somehow emerge from it,
and you see for a moment this angry face

02:02:24.654 --> 02:02:29.818
(snarling) in the water towards you as both of
them begin to rush in towards you in the center of

02:02:29.818 --> 02:02:30.517
the chamber.

02:02:30.859 --> 02:02:33.318
MATT: We're going to go ahead and take a break
there.

02:02:33.318 --> 02:02:34.362
(groaning)

02:02:34.362 --> 02:02:36.269
MATT: And we're going to start with rolling
initiative when we return.

02:02:36.269 --> 02:02:37.593
ALL: Yay!

02:02:37.593 --> 02:02:44.387
MATT: So for our giveaway at the break, to remind
you guys, we've had to make some changes. So you

02:02:44.387 --> 02:02:48.921
need to enter in the Critical Role Twitch chat, so
if you need to jump over to twitch.tv/criticalrole

02:02:48.921 --> 02:02:54.800
to join the chat there to be part of this
giveaway. It's only good for residents of the U.S.

02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:00.268
and Canada, excluding Quebec because of weird
giveaway laws. But however, you do get the

02:03:00.268 --> 02:03:08.652
possibility of winning this fantastic purple heart
dice tower system! Including the Osmet Coast

02:03:08.652 --> 02:03:11.270
cartography by Deven Rue.

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.154
SAM: This is so cool!

02:03:16.154 --> 02:03:18.459
MATT: This is the one you had last campaign
right?

02:03:18.459 --> 02:03:20.990
SAM: Yeah, but not with a map on it. That's
amazing!

02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:26.441
MATT: Fantastic Deven Rue's the artist. But yeah,
so the word tonight is "ruby." R-U-B-Y.

02:03:26.441 --> 02:03:27.778
CAST: Ruby!

02:03:27.778 --> 02:03:30.753
MATT: Only enter it once or you will be
disqualified, but go ahead and jump over.

02:03:30.753 --> 02:03:32.365
LIAM: (singing) Best lay ever!

02:03:32.365 --> 02:03:35.579
MATT: We'll have a winner announced when we return
here in a few minutes. So, see you guys here in a

02:03:35.579 --> 02:03:37.751
few minutes.

02:03:37.751 --> 02:26:01.851
[break]

02:26:02.301 --> 02:26:06.433
MATTT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. So, we
have our winner during the break. The winner of

02:26:06.433 --> 02:26:14.883
our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway is Darksearchman.
Congratulations, dark man who searches, the

02:26:14.883 --> 02:26:22.122
searcher who lives in the dark, Darksearchman. You
are the winner. We'll get that back to you as soon

02:26:22.122 --> 02:26:25.530
as we have the opportunity. So we'll get your info
and congratulations.

02:26:25.530 --> 02:26:28.040
SAM: I'm Mr. Darksearchman.

02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:31.344
(laughing)

02:26:31.344 --> 02:26:38.993
MATT: All right friends. So, last we left off. I
need you all to roll initiative.

02:26:38.993 --> 02:26:41.754
MARISHA: That's right! I almost forgot.

02:26:41.754 --> 02:26:44.296
SAM: You already rolled.

02:26:44.296 --> 02:26:46.474
LAURA: No, it doesn't count because I'm up two
now.

02:26:46.474 --> 02:26:48.247
SAM: That's even better.

02:26:48.247 --> 02:26:49.689
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:26:49.689 --> 02:26:51.258
CAST: Ooh!

02:26:51.541 --> 02:26:53.641
MATT: All right, so 25 to 20..

02:26:53.641 --> 02:26:54.227
MARISHA: 24.

02:26:54.227 --> 02:26:59.474
MATT: All right, so it's Beau. Anyone else 25 to
20. 20 to 15?

02:26:59.474 --> 02:27:00.522
LAURA: 18.

02:27:00.522 --> 02:27:01.228
MATT: 18.

02:27:01.228 --> 02:27:02.481
TRAVIS: 16.

02:27:02.481 --> 02:27:04.545
SAM: No, no. You got 19.

02:27:04.545 --> 02:27:05.875
LAURA: I did?

02:27:05.875 --> 02:27:06.902
SAM: Yeah.

02:27:06.902 --> 02:27:08.606
LAURA: I got 19! Thank you.

02:27:08.606 --> 02:27:09.594
MATT: There you go.

02:27:09.594 --> 02:27:10.536
TRAVIS: 16.

02:27:10.536 --> 02:27:12.867
MATT: 16. All right, 15 to ten?

02:27:12.867 --> 02:27:13.464
TALIESIN: 14.

02:27:13.464 --> 02:27:14.352
SAM: Ten.

02:27:14.352 --> 02:27:15.312
LIAM: 13.

02:27:15.312 --> 02:27:16.705
SAM: Oh, Ashley's back.

02:27:16.705 --> 02:27:17.750
ASHLEY: Hey guys.

02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:20.457
(laughing)

02:27:20.457 --> 02:27:22.116
TALIESIN: So, you rolled low initiative.

02:27:22.116 --> 02:27:23.685
MATT: Nott, What did you get?

02:27:23.685 --> 02:27:24.386
SAM: Ten.

02:27:25.306 --> 02:27:27.820
MATT: And then taking up the rear.

02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:29.035
ASHLEY: Nine.

02:27:29.035 --> 02:27:30.273
MATT: There we go.

02:27:30.333 --> 02:27:32.115
LIAM: What did you get Ash?

02:27:32.115 --> 02:27:35.035
ASHLEY: Yeah, I even have a plus to my initiative
this time around.

02:27:35.035 --> 02:27:35.609
TALIESIN: You rolled a seven.

02:27:35.609 --> 02:27:37.384
ASHLEY: I still rolled low. I rolled a seven.

02:27:37.869 --> 02:27:44.363
MATT: That's all right. So, first round of battle.
Up first, you watch as these two emerging

02:27:44.363 --> 02:27:52.210
whirlpools begin to form into these amorphous
angry spinning and intense-looking tiny water

02:27:52.210 --> 02:27:59.267
spouts with bashing pseudopods that swing out and
attempt to make some sort of heavy impact with

02:27:59.267 --> 02:28:03.429
anybody who's nearby. They seem strangely
sentient, as opposed to being some sort of

02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:08.835
manifested trap. However, with that first initial
attack from Beau, that's the first surprise round,

02:28:08.835 --> 02:28:11.894
we'll be going into combat. At the top of it, it
is Beau once again. So what are you doing?

02:28:11.894 --> 02:28:14.941
MARISHA: Guys! Anybody? Still me. (pop pop pop)

02:28:14.941 --> 02:28:15.918
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:28:15.918 --> 02:28:20.135
MARISHA: Two attacks, one with my staff.

02:28:20.135 --> 02:28:21.540
MATT: Are you running up to attack?

02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:22.127
MARISHA: Yes.

02:28:22.127 --> 02:28:22.970
MATT: All right.

02:28:22.970 --> 02:28:27.810
MARISHA: That's a natural one on that first
attack. Well that sucks.

02:28:27.810 --> 02:28:29.782
MATT: All right, so you go ahead and swing and--

02:28:29.782 --> 02:28:33.489
MATT: With your staff, and as you give a big old
push, you watch as it just dissolves and falls

02:28:33.489 --> 02:28:38.711
below and you're just swinging into the air. It
hits the stonework and (gong). You feel part of

02:28:38.711 --> 02:28:41.723
your elbow lock up for a second and it feels a
little numb.

02:28:41.723 --> 02:28:46.905
MARISHA: Second attack. Still not great, 15.

02:28:46.905 --> 02:28:47.933
MATT: 15 hits.

02:28:47.933 --> 02:28:53.249
MARISHA: Oh wait, but that hit before, right?
Okay, seven damage.

02:28:53.249 --> 02:28:54.790
MATT: All right, this is with your--?

02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:57.075
MARISHA: My second attack.

02:28:57.075 --> 02:28:58.404
MATT: With your staff as well?

02:28:58.404 --> 02:29:00.238
MARISHA: Still with my staff.

02:29:00.238 --> 02:29:00.690
MATT: Okay.

02:29:00.690 --> 02:29:02.996
MARISHA: Two attacks with my-- right. Attack,
attack.

02:29:02.996 --> 02:29:11.249
MATT: You notice the first impacts of the
shurikens that you had thrown seem to pass through

02:29:11.249 --> 02:29:17.774
the water with some impact, but not heavily. And
the second staff hit that strikes seems to not be

02:29:17.774 --> 02:29:23.184
as impactful against the wood. Or maybe against
the water form of this creature.

02:29:23.184 --> 02:29:29.707
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use my off hand, I'm
going to drop my-- I'm not going to drop my staff.

02:29:29.707 --> 02:29:35.244
I'm going to put my staff around, focus my chi,
and then do a palm attack.

02:29:35.244 --> 02:29:37.739
MATT: Go for it.

02:29:37.739 --> 02:29:40.163
MARISHA: Fuck. Nine.

02:29:40.163 --> 02:29:45.821
MATT: Nine misses. So with your bonus action, just
swings wide. These things are small but nimble,

02:29:45.968 --> 02:29:52.136
and they keep-- their form seems to constantly be
shifting and changing position. It's like fighting

02:29:52.136 --> 02:29:55.467
a miniature squall in the middle of it. So you're
like "Ah!" No impact.

02:29:55.467 --> 02:29:56.174
MARISHA: Cool.

02:29:56.174 --> 02:29:57.048
MATT: That ends your turn?

02:29:57.048 --> 02:29:57.630
MARISHA: Yep.

02:29:57.630 --> 02:30:00.036
MATT: All righty, next up Jester. You're up.

02:30:00.036 --> 02:30:07.386
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast... Spiritual
Weapon! Woo!

02:30:07.386 --> 02:30:09.296
SAM: Matt, is it pitch dark in here?

02:30:09.296 --> 02:30:09.946
MATT: It is.

02:30:09.946 --> 02:30:10.977
LAURA: It's pitch dark?

02:30:10.977 --> 02:30:12.872
MATT: There is no light source in here.

02:30:12.872 --> 02:30:14.918
TRAVIS: Release the Spiritual Weapon!

02:30:14.918 --> 02:30:17.281
MARISHA: I have my goggles.

02:30:17.281 --> 02:30:19.185
MATT: So, Caleb starts hearing all these noises in
his--

02:30:19.185 --> 02:30:21.361
LIAM: No, I have the Transmuter's Stone set to
dark vision.

02:30:21.361 --> 02:30:23.188
MATT: Oh, that's right! Because you do have dark
vision. So yeah, right now guys--

02:30:23.188 --> 02:30:23.894
LAURA: So, all of us can see?

02:30:23.894 --> 02:30:24.812
MATT: Where do you want it to go?

02:30:24.812 --> 02:30:26.347
LIAM: Caduceus, you can see?

02:30:26.347 --> 02:30:27.300
TALIESIN: I believe so.

02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:30.291
MATT: Actually, no. Firbolgs can't. So, Caduceus
is the only one in pitch black.

02:30:30.291 --> 02:30:33.211
TALIESIN: I'm currently in... hold on, yeah.

02:30:33.211 --> 02:30:36.028
LAURA: Right above, next to Beau.

02:30:36.028 --> 02:30:37.993
MATT: All right. here?

02:30:37.993 --> 02:30:38.643
LAURA: Yeah.

02:30:38.643 --> 02:30:39.494
MATT: You got it.

02:30:39.494 --> 02:30:42.918
LAURA: And I'm going to hit it! Or I'm going to
try.

02:30:42.918 --> 02:30:47.094
MATT: Technically, you'd have to move to have line
of sight on where it was dropped, so you'd have to shift.

02:30:47.219 --> 02:30:51.346
LAURA: Okay, I'll shift to my left. (singing) To
my left, to my-- yeah.

02:30:51.346 --> 02:30:55.436
MATT: There you go. So, moving up next to Yasha,
you watch as the spiritual weapon flash happens.

02:30:55.436 --> 02:30:57.092
LAURA: 14?

02:30:57.092 --> 02:30:58.039
MATT: 14 hits.

02:30:58.039 --> 02:31:01.453
(cheering)

02:31:01.453 --> 02:31:06.792
LAURA: 11 points of damage!

02:31:06.792 --> 02:31:11.579
MATT: Nice. While the impacts of Beau's strikes
with the staff and the shurikens weren't doing a

02:31:11.579 --> 02:31:17.378
whole lot it seemed, damaging but not anything as
hardy as you were hoping, the Spiritual Weapon

02:31:17.378 --> 02:31:24.291
comes down and seems to cleave it in half. As it
separates and reforms itself, you hear this

02:31:24.291 --> 02:31:28.518
splashing and swishing of water, it sounds almost
like a lowered, angry growl.

02:31:28.518 --> 02:31:33.184
LAURA: And then I'm going to Toll the Dead on
him!

02:31:33.184 --> 02:31:36.259
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll. Oh, that's its
roll. It's a--

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:37.960
LAURA: A wisdom save.

02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:42.035
MATT: Wisdom save. That is a natural four, so go
for it. Damage?

02:31:42.035 --> 02:31:50.184
LAURA: (yelling) 2d12! 11 points of damage!

02:31:50.184 --> 02:31:51.556
MATT: Good round.

02:31:51.556 --> 02:31:53.243
LAURA: It vibrates through the water.

02:31:53.243 --> 02:31:58.186
MATT: You watch as the impact of the cantrip
strikes it, and the water seems to shake itself

02:31:58.186 --> 02:32:04.059
around for a moment, shifting as the sound
vibrations are forcing it to coast in a strange

02:32:04.059 --> 02:32:06.550
design in its space. That ends your turn?

02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:09.004
LAURA: Suck a bag of dicks, water creature!

02:32:09.004 --> 02:32:11.631
(laughter)

02:32:11.631 --> 02:32:12.766
LAURA: And that's my turn.

02:32:12.766 --> 02:32:15.210
MATT: All right. That brings us to Fjord.

02:32:15.210 --> 02:32:19.910
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll move up to this northeastern
corner up here. Turning and seeing the--

02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:23.858
MATT: As you're pushing through, you're seeing
certain things that are sunken in the water in the

02:32:23.858 --> 02:32:28.729
corners. Looks like bits of materials that have
either washed in through the water, broken crates

02:32:28.729 --> 02:32:34.121
and bits of wood, things that gather in the edges.
You push past them with your feet as you make it there.

02:32:34.459 --> 02:32:38.693
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll throw two Eldritch Blasts to
this creature behind Caduceus.

02:32:38.693 --> 02:32:40.588
MATT: The one that appeared behind the rest? Go
for it.

02:32:40.588 --> 02:32:43.948
TRAVIS: Two attacks. First one is 13.

02:32:43.948 --> 02:32:45.715
MATT: 13? Just hits.

02:32:45.715 --> 02:32:49.179
TRAVIS: Just hits. I'll roll the second one, well
fuck. That's 12.

02:32:49.179 --> 02:32:52.106
MATT: 12 misses. So, roll damage on the first
strike.

02:32:52.106 --> 02:32:56.385
TRAVIS: Gotcha. Fuck you. Five points of damage.

02:32:56.385 --> 02:33:01.366
MATT: Five points of damage. The Eldritch Blast
hits it, and you watch as it creates this circle

02:33:01.366 --> 02:33:05.563
in the center of its elemental form as it impacts
and actually strikes the stone behind with

02:33:05.563 --> 02:33:11.492
whatever residual energy from the original impact.
The hole forms up. It took damage. It didn't seem

02:33:11.492 --> 02:33:16.379
to be as resistant as it had to previous blows.
Magic seems to cut through whatever defense it has.

02:33:16.413 --> 02:33:17.816
TRAVIS: That is my turn.

02:33:17.816 --> 02:33:19.379
MATT: That ends Fjord's. It's now their turn.

02:33:19.379 --> 02:33:20.083
SAM: Oh no.

02:33:20.083 --> 02:33:27.648
MATT: This one, who currently is engaged directly
with you, is going to wisp around into the water

02:33:27.841 --> 02:33:34.369
and emerge on the other side of Beau and is going
to go ahead and attempt to Whirlpool Strike you. I

02:33:34.369 --> 02:33:36.685
need you to make a strength saving throw, please.

02:33:36.685 --> 02:33:42.448
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

02:33:42.448 --> 02:33:51.159
MATT: As it emerges, you feel the water beneath
you begin to whip into a torrent, and you are

02:33:51.159 --> 02:33:55.173
swept off of your feet and knocked prone and are
considered currently restrained as it moves into

02:33:55.173 --> 02:34:01.423
your space. It's now currently swirling around
you, and you're having a hard time moving. It's

02:34:01.423 --> 02:34:06.884
now forcing water into your mouth. You can't
breathe in the moment. You are whelmed by the elemental.

02:34:06.917 --> 02:34:08.435
LAURA: Oh no!

02:34:08.435 --> 02:34:14.966
MATT: So that ends its turn. The one over here is
going to go ahead, because it's closest to

02:34:15.295 --> 02:34:19.147
Caduceus, it's just going to shift up into your
space, get in contact with both you and Caleb, and

02:34:19.147 --> 02:34:25.194
it's going to attempt to whelm you, as well. I
need you to go ahead-- it can only target one

02:34:25.194 --> 02:34:28.039
person-- but I need you to make a strength saving
throw for me, Caduceus.

02:34:28.039 --> 02:34:31.343
TALIESIN: All right. That's a 17.

02:34:31.343 --> 02:34:36.291
MATT: 17? That's a success! You feel the same
water swirling around your legs, and you manage to

02:34:36.291 --> 02:34:41.436
pull back and wrench your legs free as the torrent
comes to a slow crawl once more, and the

02:34:41.436 --> 02:34:48.303
creature's form emerges. You can see the water now
forming these two large sledgehammer-like fists

02:34:48.303 --> 02:34:52.786
that hang at its somewhat four,
four-and-a-half-foot tall torso. That's going to

02:34:52.786 --> 02:34:55.650
end both of their turns. Caduceus, you're up.

02:34:55.650 --> 02:34:57.631
TALIESIN: How well can I see right now?

02:34:57.631 --> 02:34:58.619
MATT: Not very well.

02:34:58.619 --> 02:35:03.537
MATT: Pretty much not at all. It is pitch black.
You are considered blind.

02:35:03.537 --> 02:35:04.601
LAURA: Oh no.

02:35:04.601 --> 02:35:08.270
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm considered blind. That's fine.
There's nothing much I can do about that right

02:35:08.270 --> 02:35:20.036
now. I'm going to-- hold a Sacred Flame until I
can actually see what I'm attempting to attack.

02:35:20.036 --> 02:35:21.687
Like, until I can see well enough to--

02:35:21.687 --> 02:35:24.573
MATT: As soon as you can see an enemy, you will
release your Sacred Flame.

02:35:24.573 --> 02:35:31.550
TALIESIN: Yes, Sacred Flame. In the meantime, I'll
just stay to myself and maybe try and walk around

02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:36.392
to, yeah, just like there.

02:35:36.392 --> 02:35:41.862
MATT: Okay, so you can hear it and the focus of
this swirling, splashing sound.

02:35:42.111 --> 02:35:44.518
TALIESIN: I could use a little light!

02:35:44.518 --> 02:35:46.814
MATT: All right, so Caduceus side-steps. Caleb,
you're up.

02:35:46.814 --> 02:35:51.591
LIAM: Yeah okay, so I was looking down towards
this grate under the water, and I heard the room

02:35:51.591 --> 02:35:57.267
go to hell behind me and hear the splashing where
Beauregard is, so I move in that direction.

02:35:57.267 --> 02:35:59.079
MATT: All right, so you move this way?

02:35:59.079 --> 02:35:59.870
LIAM: Yeah.

02:35:59.870 --> 02:36:06.160
MATT: Okay, it's going to go ahead and take a
swipe at you with a slam attack. That is a 22 to hit.

02:36:06.197 --> 02:36:07.983
LIAM: I take it, yeah.

02:36:07.983 --> 02:36:15.425
MATT: You suffer-- oh wow. That is 12 points of
bludgeoning damage. You get slammed in the lower

02:36:15.425 --> 02:36:22.013
back, the hip area, and almost spin from the blow
of it, but continue to stumble forward over to the

02:36:22.013 --> 02:36:23.551
position you wanted to be.

02:36:23.551 --> 02:36:28.439
LIAM: So, I stumble forward, and I'm reaching into
my pockets, and I pull out the iron powder, and I

02:36:28.439 --> 02:36:34.083
throw it into the air again, and I go (whoof) with
my hands, and Beauregard enlarges within the grasp

02:36:34.083 --> 02:36:35.676
of this... thing.

02:36:35.676 --> 02:36:39.194
MATT: All right. Still restrained.

02:36:39.194 --> 02:36:42.553
LIAM: Yeah, but with advantage on strength checks
now.

02:36:42.553 --> 02:36:43.367
MATT: Correct.

02:36:43.367 --> 02:36:49.480
LIAM: And I will go as far into that corner,
hiding between Fjord and the corner, if I'm able to.

02:36:49.501 --> 02:36:54.239
MATT: All right. So, that is about as far as you
can get right there because Fjord is currently in

02:36:54.354 --> 02:37:03.321
the far corner. And I'm marking you with
concentration just so I can keep tabs on that. All

02:37:03.321 --> 02:37:05.959
right, so that ends Caleb's go. Nott, you're up.

02:37:05.959 --> 02:37:13.838
SAM: I see the damage done to my lovely friends,
and seeing as I care about Caleb slightly more, I

02:37:13.838 --> 02:37:22.170
will attack the one that hit-- no offense-- I will
attack the one that hit Caleb with a shot of a

02:37:22.170 --> 02:37:26.097
Tinkertop Blaster, whatever it's called.

02:37:26.097 --> 02:37:27.269
MATT: Go for it.

02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:28.760
SAM: All right, so that's 20-something to hit.

02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:29.427
MATT: That hits.

02:37:29.427 --> 02:37:33.128
SAM: He's engaged with firbolg over here, right?

02:37:33.128 --> 02:37:34.492
MATT: Mhmm.

02:37:34.492 --> 02:37:43.028
SAM: That's four, four, four, so plus <i>yikes</i> five
is--

02:37:43.028 --> 02:37:43.921
LAURA: 17.

02:37:43.921 --> 02:37:45.899
SAM: Thank you. (laughing) That.

02:37:45.899 --> 02:37:50.312
MATT: All right, 17 points of damage on him, nice.
Because it is magical, it bypasses the defenses.

02:37:50.312 --> 02:37:56.414
You watch as the bolt hits and there's a spark as
it impacts, and for a second, it seems to almost

02:37:56.414 --> 02:38:01.775
lose its corporeal form then flickers back in. The
bolt sinks down into the water below, beneath the

02:38:01.775 --> 02:38:04.725
knee-level of the liquid that seems to consume the
entire chamber.

02:38:04.725 --> 02:38:07.368
MARISHA: He took an arrow to the knee. Sorry.

02:38:07.368 --> 02:38:11.477
MATT: Which as a note guys, those who have been
moving around, I should mention it. I've been

02:38:11.549 --> 02:38:14.591
keeping tabs under my own right. Moving through
this is considered difficult terrain because you

02:38:14.591 --> 02:38:18.370
are about knee- to thigh-high in water, and you're
having to basically wade through as you go.

02:38:18.370 --> 02:38:19.747
LAURA: Except for Nott.

02:38:19.747 --> 02:38:21.941
MATT: Except for Nott, who's standing above it.

02:38:21.941 --> 02:38:25.662
LIAM: What about Fjord? His swim speed is his
movement speed.

02:38:25.662 --> 02:38:31.406
MATT: Technically, the Mariner's Armor would give
you a swim speed. So you can move through it at

02:38:31.406 --> 02:38:34.248
your regular speed. So you don't have to worry
about it. That is correct.

02:38:34.248 --> 02:38:42.028
SAM: I will use my bonus action to... Well, I'll
use my movement to sort of tuck back into the

02:38:42.028 --> 02:38:43.470
hallway there.

02:38:43.470 --> 02:38:44.328
MATT: Here?

02:38:44.328 --> 02:38:50.186
SAM: Yeah, if I can, and then I'll bonus action to
hide. Press myself up against a wall or

02:38:50.186 --> 02:38:50.935
something.

02:38:50.935 --> 02:38:53.105
MATT: You'll probably have to move a little
farther back to break sight from one of these

02:38:53.105 --> 02:38:54.651
enemies, but go ahead.

02:38:54.651 --> 02:38:58.763
SAM: That's fine. All right. Not great. 18.

02:38:58.763 --> 02:38:59.653
MATT: Okay.

02:38:59.653 --> 02:39:04.085
SAM: Wait is this... stealth? 18.

02:39:04.085 --> 02:39:05.868
MATT: Okay, good to know.

02:39:05.868 --> 02:39:08.524
SAM: I was looking for the hide ability.

02:39:08.524 --> 02:39:11.188
MATT: Gotcha. Yeah, that's just an action.

02:39:11.188 --> 02:39:13.884
SAM: Have I been drunk at this point? I don't
know, am I?

02:39:13.884 --> 02:39:18.234
MATT: You're not quite-- No, you would've had to
have been to go through, if you weren't affected

02:39:18.234 --> 02:39:19.496
by a Suggestion spell.

02:39:19.496 --> 02:39:20.503
SAM: Okay, so I'm okay.

02:39:20.503 --> 02:39:21.849
MATT: You're on the verge. Like, you're tipsy.

02:39:21.849 --> 02:39:22.521
SAM: Okay, good.

02:39:22.521 --> 02:39:26.812
MATT: But you're not <i>drunk.</i> All right, that
finishes your go?

02:39:26.812 --> 02:39:27.488
SAM: Yes!

02:39:27.488 --> 02:39:28.484
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

02:39:28.484 --> 02:39:29.580
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:31.532
SAM: I told you water was terrible!

02:39:31.532 --> 02:39:35.583
MATT: You've seen Beau suddenly grown to a larger
size but still being swarmed by the water of this

02:39:35.583 --> 02:39:36.797
elemental form.

02:39:36.797 --> 02:39:38.562
ASHLEY: Well for one, I would like to rage.

02:39:38.562 --> 02:39:40.233
MATT: All righty.

02:39:40.233 --> 02:39:47.003
ASHLEY: Is it possible to try to pull her out, or
am I able to--

02:39:47.003 --> 02:39:48.160
MATT: You can try.

02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:51.303
ASHLEY: Am I able to attack it... without hurting
her?

02:39:51.303 --> 02:39:52.036
TRAVIS: Nein.

02:39:52.036 --> 02:39:54.157
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:39:54.157 --> 02:39:55.433
ASHLEY: I don't want to try it.

02:39:55.433 --> 02:39:57.614
MARISHA: Just go for it! (gurgling sounds)

02:39:57.614 --> 02:40:01.313
MATT: So, you move up adjacent to Beau and the one
creature, and what are you going to do? Are you

02:40:01.313 --> 02:40:02.917
going to attempt and pull her out?

02:40:02.917 --> 02:40:04.831
ASHLEY: I'm going to attempt and pull her out.

02:40:04.831 --> 02:40:08.908
MATT: Okay, so you use your action. I need you to
go ahead and make a strength check. You have

02:40:08.908 --> 02:40:10.123
advantage because you are raging.

02:40:10.123 --> 02:40:11.391
TRAVIS: (as Beau) I feel alive!

02:40:11.391 --> 02:40:13.794
MARISHA: I haven't felt anything since she left!

02:40:13.794 --> 02:40:17.008
ASHLEY: Oh, no. Eight.

02:40:17.008 --> 02:40:22.059
MATT: Eight. You go and grab and try to pull her,
but, unfortunately, the water and sediment in here

02:40:22.059 --> 02:40:27.484
has given a slick surface to the floor. As you
pull, your feet keep skidding across the floor.

02:40:27.484 --> 02:40:30.371
You can't get any sort of purchase, and you can't
pull her out, unfortunately.

02:40:30.371 --> 02:40:31.598
TRAVIS: Is that a strength check?

02:40:31.598 --> 02:40:32.784
ASHLEY: Yeah, I should've attacked.

02:40:32.784 --> 02:40:34.682
TRAVIS: Did you make it with advantage? You're
raging.

02:40:34.682 --> 02:40:37.280
MATT: Yeah, you rolled... Was that not with
advantage? Roll again!

02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:38.826
TRAVIS: I got you, boo.

02:40:38.826 --> 02:40:39.935
ASHLEY: Shit. That's cocked.

02:40:39.935 --> 02:40:43.671
SAM: Matt, I've been rolling the wrong number of
die every time.

02:40:43.671 --> 02:40:44.531
ASHLEY: 17.

02:40:44.531 --> 02:40:47.609
MATT: Okay, hold on. You've been rolling the wrong
number of dice?

02:40:47.609 --> 02:40:50.595
SAM: I've been rolling 3d6, but it should've been
four.

02:40:50.595 --> 02:40:51.056
MATT: Oh, well.

02:40:51.056 --> 02:40:53.599
SAM: So, I got an extra one point of damage.

02:40:53.599 --> 02:40:54.685
MATT: Good to know.

02:40:54.685 --> 02:40:56.345
(laughter)

02:40:56.345 --> 02:41:00.552
MATT: Keep that in mind for the future. So, 17
will be enough. So, as your feet are slipping on

02:41:00.552 --> 02:41:06.227
the ground, you go ahead and take your sword and
jam it into the stone on the side and use that.

02:41:06.227 --> 02:41:11.550
With your other hand, you get it underneath Beau's
larger arm and wrench her free from the creature's grasp.

02:41:11.561 --> 02:41:12.789
MARISHA: (deep voice) Thanks!

02:41:12.789 --> 02:41:14.298
ASHLEY: (deep voice) Welcome!

02:41:14.298 --> 02:41:15.537
MATT: So Beau, you are still in this space, a
little bit--

02:41:15.537 --> 02:41:16.428
ASHLEY: (deep voice) Wow!

02:41:16.428 --> 02:41:17.810
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Hey, shorty.

02:41:17.810 --> 02:41:18.540
MARISHA: (deep voice) Hey!

02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:22.602
MATT: You're still in the space of the creature,
but you've managed to be pulled free from it. So,

02:41:22.602 --> 02:41:25.160
you're still prone, but you are not currently
whelmed by it.

02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:25.780
MARISHA: Dope.

02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:28.314
MATT: All right, that ends Yasha's go, unless you
want to move?

02:41:28.314 --> 02:41:30.344
ASHLEY: No, I'm going to stay.

02:41:30.344 --> 02:41:34.467
MATT: You pull your sword out of the wall and get
ready for the next round of combat. This brings us

02:41:34.467 --> 02:41:36.560
to the top of the round. Beau, you're up! Jester,
you're next.

02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:42.667
MARISHA: (deep voice) I'm back! Can I do like a
cool, monk-like kick and go pop pop! Like two

02:41:42.667 --> 02:41:45.429
unarmed attacks as I kick-kick with my legs?

02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:46.517
MATT: Yeah, yeah! Make--

02:41:46.517 --> 02:41:48.007
MARISHA: Some capoeira shit?

02:41:48.007 --> 02:41:55.014
MATT: Yeah, you can. Which, as you do, it's a
spray and spin windmill of water in the air around

02:41:55.014 --> 02:41:56.881
it. Go ahead and make your attacks.

02:41:56.881 --> 02:42:04.357
MARISHA: First two unarmed. That first one is an
18, being a 25. Second one's an eight, being a 15.

02:42:04.387 --> 02:42:05.759
MATT: Both hit.

02:42:05.759 --> 02:42:07.526
SAM: Ooh, Tracy!

02:42:07.526 --> 02:42:10.651
MARISHA: (Valley girl voice) Oh my god, Tracy's
back!

02:42:10.651 --> 02:42:12.038
LIAM: Added damage.

02:42:12.038 --> 02:42:20.720
MARISHA: My dad sent me to a fancy prep school.
Oh, that's a suck balls roll. Two ones on my

02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:30.078
sixes. So two, but I got a four and a three from
that extra d4, so nine. Nein!

02:42:30.078 --> 02:42:35.396
MATT: Nine points of damage to it from the
spinning kick landing on the ground. You are now

02:42:35.396 --> 02:42:41.264
just barely mid-calf in water, but it's also about
ten feet tall in here, so you're having to hunch a

02:42:41.264 --> 02:42:44.609
little bit. Your head actually hits the ceiling a
bit. You're like (groaning).

02:42:44.609 --> 02:42:49.518
MARISHA: I'm now going to spend a ki point because
I hit twice to do Extract Aspects.

02:42:49.795 --> 02:42:50.593
MATT: Okay.

02:42:50.593 --> 02:42:52.334
MARISHA: I want to learn--

02:42:52.334 --> 02:42:54.749
MATT: I don't think you can spend a ki point to do
that. It's just an ability you get to use.

02:42:54.749 --> 02:42:58.172
MARISHA: That's right, we switched that. Oh! It's
just an ability I get to use now.

02:42:58.172 --> 02:42:58.736
MATT: Yes.

02:42:58.736 --> 02:43:03.347
MARISHA: Right. So, I hit twice. I would like to
know its constitution saving throw and if it has

02:43:03.347 --> 02:43:08.773
any damage... not resistances, but the opposite of
that.

02:43:08.773 --> 02:43:09.770
MATT: Immunities?

02:43:09.770 --> 02:43:11.424
MARISHA: Vulnerabilities.

02:43:11.424 --> 02:43:20.903
MATT: Vulnerabilities, okay. Its constitution
saving throw is a plus three. It's not technically

02:43:20.903 --> 02:43:25.762
a vulnerability, but you do see that if it takes
cold damage, it partially freezes, which reduces

02:43:25.762 --> 02:43:27.487
its speed.

02:43:27.487 --> 02:43:29.773
MARISHA: Okay.

02:43:29.773 --> 02:43:31.848
SAM: We know things.

02:43:31.848 --> 02:43:37.280
MARISHA: I just shout it out and say, I think if
we freeze the thing, it'll like freeze because

02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:44.951
water! And then I'm going to spend another ki
point and do Flurry of Blows.

02:43:44.951 --> 02:43:46.729
MAT: Okay, two more strikes. Go for it.

02:43:46.729 --> 02:43:57.342
MARISHA: Pop pop with my fists! First attack is a
22, sorry 23. No, 22, I was right the first time.

02:43:57.342 --> 02:43:59.828
The second one is not good, it's a nine.

02:43:59.828 --> 02:44:02.202
MATT: Okay, so the first one does hit, second one
misses.

02:44:02.202 --> 02:44:07.099
MARISHA: That is-- ooh! Ten damage.

02:44:07.099 --> 02:44:11.899
MATT: Ten damage. Very good. So with that, as
you're standing there, you go ahead and swing one

02:44:11.899 --> 02:44:16.081
fist down and it strikes right at the center of
it, and you watch as it separates for a second. As

02:44:16.081 --> 02:44:19.561
it reforms, you go for another strike, and this
time it manages to duck just out of the way,

02:44:19.561 --> 02:44:24.349
seeing the precursor of that strike, and it dodges
entirely. That finishes your turn?

02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:25.204
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:25.204 --> 02:44:27.640
MATT: All right. That brings us to Jester.

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:29.399
LAURA: Bring my Spiritual Weapon down!

02:44:29.399 --> 02:44:33.413
MATT: All right.

02:44:33.413 --> 02:44:35.499
LAURA: That's 16.

02:44:35.499 --> 02:44:38.772
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:44:38.772 --> 02:44:43.035
LAURA: That sucks. This plus four is five!

02:44:43.035 --> 02:44:44.470
SAM: Amazing.

02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:49.774
LAURA: And then I'm going to use Guiding Bolt at
the other one.

02:44:49.774 --> 02:44:51.117
MATT: Go for it.

02:44:51.117 --> 02:44:56.349
LAURA: And I'm assuming-- tell me if I'm wrong--
because it's a flash of light that streaks towards

02:44:56.349 --> 02:44:59.978
the creature, that would give enough light for
Caduceus to send something out?

02:44:59.978 --> 02:45:01.365
MATT: I'll allow it.

02:45:01.365 --> 02:45:02.822
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:45:02.822 --> 02:45:06.041
LAURA: All right. Okay, so how do I do Guiding
Bolt?

02:45:06.041 --> 02:45:10.981
MATT: So you roll an attack roll, so a spell
attack roll, ranged spell attack roll. That's

02:45:10.981 --> 02:45:12.719
cocked, yeah.

02:45:12.719 --> 02:45:15.710
LAURA: 11 plus seven. 18.

02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:17.822
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for your
Guiding Bolt.

02:45:17.822 --> 02:45:19.662
LAURA: That is 4d6!

02:45:19.662 --> 02:45:22.101
SAM: Yeah!

02:45:22.101 --> 02:45:24.555
LAURA: 15.

02:45:24.555 --> 02:45:30.779
MATT: 15 points of radiant damage to it. In the
middle of this darkness there's this flash of

02:45:30.779 --> 02:45:36.508
light and this streaking beam of radiant energy
that strikes and blasts into the elemental.

02:45:36.508 --> 02:45:42.880
Caduceus, in that one moment, your eyes suddenly
focus in on the glowing form, almost in slow

02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:47.863
motion as this elemental is slowly bursting from
the radiant energy, and you see that moment.

02:45:47.863 --> 02:45:49.296
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame.

02:45:49.296 --> 02:45:50.647
MATT: All right, so that's a wisdom saving throw?

02:45:50.647 --> 02:45:52.425
TALIESIN: Dex saving throw. 16.

02:45:52.425 --> 02:45:56.999
MATT: Dex saving throw. That is a 14, it fails.
All right, it'll take the damage on that one.

02:45:56.999 --> 02:46:06.763
TALIESIN: (counting) 12 points of I believe-- is
that radiant damage? Yeah. 12 points of radiant damage.

02:46:07.942 --> 02:46:14.012
MATT: They're both looking a little hurt and a
little aggressive. They're now starting to get a

02:46:14.012 --> 02:46:17.177
little frenzied. That ends your turn, Jester?

02:46:17.177 --> 02:46:19.661
LAURA: Yes. Advantage on attacks against that
one.

02:46:19.661 --> 02:46:23.729
MATT: Actually-- yes, because that wasn't an
attack roll. Fjord, you're up.

02:46:23.729 --> 02:46:34.648
TRAVIS: Can I approach the water fuck that's on
Mr. Clay? And I will use Booming Blade against it.

02:46:34.648 --> 02:46:35.810
MATT: Okay.

02:46:35.810 --> 02:46:38.021
LAURA: Advantage!

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:39.674
TRAVIS: Advantage?

02:46:39.674 --> 02:46:41.059
MATT: Yeah, she used Guiding Bolt.

02:46:41.059 --> 02:46:41.560
TRAVIS: Amazing.

02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:42.868
LIAM: She lit it up.

02:46:42.868 --> 02:46:44.481
TRAVIS: It's cocked. Natural 20.

02:46:44.481 --> 02:46:46.396
(cheering)

02:46:46.396 --> 02:46:47.533
MATT: There you go.

02:46:47.533 --> 02:46:51.309
TRAVIS: So at 5th level it deals 2d8 thunder
damage to the target.

02:46:51.309 --> 02:46:53.147
MATT: Correct. So 2d8--

02:46:53.147 --> 02:46:55.138
TRAVIS: Four.

02:46:55.138 --> 02:47:00.031
MATT: Four. So eight, plus whatever the modifier
is. Or it's just 2d8, right? Booming Blade is

02:47:00.031 --> 02:47:01.389
still an attack.

02:47:01.389 --> 02:47:04.013
TRAVIS: Yeah that's it, that's just 2d8. So eight
points of damage.

02:47:04.013 --> 02:47:09.409
MATT: Eight points of damage. (impact noise) It is
currently encircled by the booming energy.

02:47:09.409 --> 02:47:12.017
TRAVIS: Booming energy, yes.

02:47:12.017 --> 02:47:13.537
LAURA: What the heck is that?

02:47:13.537 --> 02:47:15.458
LIAM: (effeminate voice) What's that, Travis,
what's that?

02:47:15.458 --> 02:47:16.981
LAURA: Tell us what it means.

02:47:16.981 --> 02:47:18.210
SAM: Booming dick energy!

02:47:18.210 --> 02:47:20.262
(laughter)

02:47:20.262 --> 02:47:21.444
LIAM: BDE.

02:47:21.444 --> 02:47:24.301
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn, Fjord?

02:47:24.301 --> 02:47:25.400
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:31.982
MATT: All righty. It's now their turn. So this one
here, now low on health and a bit frenzied, is

02:47:31.982 --> 02:47:37.456
going to go ahead and take two strikes at the
enlarged Beauregard that has been its issue at

02:47:37.456 --> 02:47:45.041
this time. That's going to be a 21 to hit and a 22
to hit. 15 and 16 naturally.

02:47:45.041 --> 02:47:45.793
MARISHA: Yep.

02:47:45.793 --> 02:47:47.199
SAM: H2 oh, no!

02:47:47.199 --> 02:47:49.100
(laughter)

02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:51.256
MATT: Oh my god, Sam.

02:47:51.256 --> 02:47:52.159
TRAVIS: Nasty!

02:47:52.159 --> 02:47:56.237
LIAM: What, you numb your own tongue with that
one?

02:47:56.237 --> 02:48:03.817
MATT: It's 18 points of bludgeoning damage to you,
Beauregard. For its being so small, the short

02:48:03.817 --> 02:48:09.890
bursts of impact, it seems that in its harrowed
state it's lashing out with all that it can. The

02:48:09.890 --> 02:48:16.130
other one is going to go ahead and attempt to make
a strike at Fjord and a strike at Caduceus. The

02:48:16.130 --> 02:48:22.229
one against Fjord is a natural one. It goes to swing
out towards you and you hold the blade up and you

02:48:22.229 --> 02:48:30.139
watch as it actually splits its extruding watery
arm across the blade. It divides, then splashes into--

02:48:30.139 --> 02:48:31.376
TRAVIS: Water on water violence.

02:48:31.376 --> 02:48:36.503
MATT: Yeah. Falls harmlessly onto the ground and
it has to reform a new pseudopod. The other arm

02:48:36.503 --> 02:48:38.942
swings back towards Caduceus.

02:48:38.942 --> 02:48:40.144
LAURA: Science!

02:48:40.144 --> 02:48:42.777
MATT: That's going to be a 13 to hit.

02:48:42.777 --> 02:48:44.585
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

02:48:44.585 --> 02:48:48.453
MATT: You pull up your shield and deflect it off
to the side. No major issue there. That finishes

02:48:48.453 --> 02:48:51.702
their go-- actually no. This guy's going to go
ahead and move, this one's going to go ahead and

02:48:51.702 --> 02:48:56.186
shift over towards-- Jester is becoming a problem.
Caduceus, you do have an attack of opportunity if

02:48:56.186 --> 02:48:57.781
you want to take one.

02:48:57.781 --> 02:48:59.539
TALIESIN: Sure. Is it disadvantage because I can't
see?

02:48:59.539 --> 02:49:00.926
MATT: Correct, yes.

02:49:00.926 --> 02:49:04.699
TRAVIS: And booming energy. So when he moves he
takes an additional 2d8.

02:49:04.699 --> 02:49:05.293
MATT: Correct.

02:49:05.293 --> 02:49:07.489
SAM, LIAM, and ASHLEY: Ooh.

02:49:07.489 --> 02:49:10.868
TRAVIS: Nine points of booming damage. (impact
noise)

02:49:10.868 --> 02:49:16.943
MARISHA: Nein! It's like that glass of water in
Jurassic Park.

02:49:16.943 --> 02:49:21.046
TALIESIN: That's the same roll. That's 12.

02:49:21.046 --> 02:49:26.746
MATT: No worry there, then. That does not hit.
That brings us to Caduceus's turn, you're up.

02:49:26.746 --> 02:49:27.892
TALIESIN: I'm still blind?

02:49:27.892 --> 02:49:28.805
MATT: You're still blind.

02:49:28.805 --> 02:49:34.557
TALIESIN: At some point I'm going to have to--
I've never fixed the fact that I'm a cantrip down,

02:49:35.055 --> 02:49:37.754
which I will have to fix at some point because
this is--

02:49:37.754 --> 02:49:38.738
MATT: You should.

02:49:38.738 --> 02:49:42.461
TALIESIN: I think I had this at one point, and
yeah it did not have that. I'm going to just ready

02:49:42.461 --> 02:49:48.193
another-- actually I'm free now. I'm going to try
and back into the corner near that treasure chest.

02:49:48.193 --> 02:49:49.761
I'm just going to ready another--

02:49:49.761 --> 02:49:51.093
LAURA: There's a treasure chest?!

02:49:51.093 --> 02:49:52.176
MATT: It's a barrel.

02:49:52.176 --> 02:49:53.636
TALIESIN: Barrel. It's filled with treasure.

02:49:53.636 --> 02:49:55.032
(laughter)

02:49:55.032 --> 02:49:57.121
MATT: You played Diablo, you know how this works.
Ting!

02:49:57.121 --> 02:50:01.120
TALIESIN: It's one gold coin. I'm just going to
ready another Guiding Bolt for the second I can

02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:02.238
see anything.

02:50:02.238 --> 02:50:04.175
MATT: You got it. Finishing Caduceus's turn,
Caleb, you're up.

02:50:04.175 --> 02:50:10.252
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to move into that corner and
I'm going to rifle into my pockets and pull out a

02:50:10.252 --> 02:50:17.701
small snake's gut peppered in powdered rhubarb
leaf, and I stick my hand out and point at the one

02:50:17.701 --> 02:50:23.920
messing with my human friend over there, and I
take the snake's gut and I pull it back like I am

02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:28.440
drawing a bowstring as I mutter and I let go and
cast Melf's Acid Arrow.

02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:30.156
MATT: All righty.

02:50:30.249 --> 02:50:32.655
MARISHA: You're you in the opening title sequence
right now!

02:50:32.655 --> 02:50:33.956
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> that is correct.

02:50:33.956 --> 02:50:34.759
MARISHA: You're doing--

02:50:34.759 --> 02:50:35.781
TRAVIS: You're doing it!

02:50:35.781 --> 02:50:37.796
MARISHA: You're doing it! It's so real.

02:50:37.796 --> 02:50:39.540
TRAVIS: How do you spell the first word of that
spell?

02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:41.563
LIAM: Melf. M-E-L-F.

02:50:41.563 --> 02:50:42.386
ASHLEY: Melf.

02:50:42.386 --> 02:50:43.723
TRAVIS: Unfortunately.

02:50:43.723 --> 02:50:45.834
MATT: He's a very prominent sorcerer, or wizard.

02:50:45.834 --> 02:50:48.912
LIAM: You love it. That is a 23 to hit.

02:50:48.912 --> 02:50:51.632
MATT: 23 does hit.

02:50:51.632 --> 02:51:00.716
LIAM: Yeah. (counting) Nine points of acid
damage.

02:51:00.716 --> 02:51:07.958
MATT: Nine points of acid damage to it. As the
acid arrow strikes and impacts on its form,

02:51:08.222 --> 02:51:13.960
there's this splash of acidic liquid that actually
should-- I believe Beau also has to make?

02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:18.572
LIAM: It doesn't say anything, at least, in the
D&D Beyond. Let's look in the actual book.

02:51:18.572 --> 02:51:20.251
SAM: D&D Beyond is the greatest.

02:51:20.251 --> 02:51:22.472
LIAM: Doesn't say anything about splash attack.

02:51:22.472 --> 02:51:27.668
MATT: Yeah, it does take lesser damage from the
acid, but it didn't have a lot of hit points left.

02:51:27.668 --> 02:51:33.525
So the impact is lessened. However, let me
double-check here for the acid arrow.

02:51:33.525 --> 02:51:36.779
SAM: Science. Math. Acid.

02:51:36.779 --> 02:51:39.555
LIAM: Don't do me wrong, D&D Beyond.

02:51:39.555 --> 02:51:42.877
TALIESIN: The water elemental is going to sit
there and have a long thought about its relationships.

02:51:42.877 --> 02:51:45.777
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:51:45.777 --> 02:51:53.935
MATT: No sorry, that's older systems. Yeah, no.
That doesn't matter. Older systems would do splash

02:51:53.935 --> 02:52:00.162
acid damage, but not in this one. So yeah, you
manage to pull out of the way as it falls back and

02:52:00.665 --> 02:52:04.194
dissolves amongst the rest of it, a little bit of
sea foam left behind in its wake.

02:52:04.194 --> 02:52:05.049
TRAVIS: Hard water.

02:52:05.049 --> 02:52:06.413
TALIESIN: Sea foam, that's all you are.

02:52:06.413 --> 02:52:08.095
MARISHA: Oh, the one next to me. Thanks!

02:52:08.095 --> 02:52:10.599
LIAM: I'm going to tuck my snake gut back into its
pocket.

02:52:10.599 --> 02:52:14.133
MATT: All right. Finishing Caleb's turn, Nott,
you're up.

02:52:14.133 --> 02:52:23.718
SAM: I will fire my arrow thing at the creature,
striking it with 20 something! 20 things. Is it

02:52:23.718 --> 02:52:25.070
engaged in something?

02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:27.044
MATT: It is engaged with Jester, yes.

02:52:27.044 --> 02:52:28.156
LAURA: It's engaged to me.

02:52:28.156 --> 02:52:28.816
SAM: Oh.

02:52:28.816 --> 02:52:30.203
TRAVIS: Roll your extra thing.

02:52:30.203 --> 02:52:31.675
SAM: I did. It's still terrible.

02:52:31.675 --> 02:52:33.144
LIAM: It's six, though.

02:52:33.144 --> 02:52:33.989
LAURA: It's not terrible.

02:52:33.989 --> 02:52:35.979
SAM: 17 again.

02:52:35.979 --> 02:52:40.934
MATT: 17? As that one impacts, you see it reaching
out with both of its fists towards Jester. As it

02:52:40.934 --> 02:52:47.118
strikes her, its midsection just turns into bits
of foam and sea water as it splashes against her

02:52:47.118 --> 02:52:48.694
armor and shield.

02:52:48.694 --> 02:52:50.340
SAM: I hate water!

02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:52.735
LAURA: Fjord, I am your dream!

02:52:52.735 --> 02:52:58.330
TRAVIS: Yeah. See? No big deal.

02:52:58.330 --> 02:53:00.592
SAM: (panting heavily) Big deal!

02:53:00.592 --> 02:53:01.627
TRAVIS: Water's your friend.

02:53:01.627 --> 02:53:04.879
SAM: Water is terrible. It tried to kill us! It
actively wants to kill us!

02:53:04.879 --> 02:53:07.700
TRAVIS: Are there any drains on the floor as we
walk around?

02:53:07.700 --> 02:53:13.311
MATT: As you glance around, keeping an eye out,
make an investigation check.

02:53:13.311 --> 02:53:18.570
TRAVIS: 14.

02:53:18.570 --> 02:53:26.957
MATT: Feeling through the floor and finding your
space in here, you do not find any grates or any

02:53:26.957 --> 02:53:34.430
other exits beyond the tunnel ahead of you, the
tunnel you came from, and the small grate on the

02:53:34.430 --> 02:53:40.889
side. But it's high enough where the water doesn't
actually meet that level yet. But you do see the

02:53:40.889 --> 02:53:46.421
trailing signs of runoff and various bits of
minerals that have gathered and dripped out over

02:53:46.421 --> 02:53:48.650
time to cause some discoloration to the stone.

02:53:48.650 --> 02:53:51.108
TRAVIS: Caleb, didn't you want to explore that
smaller tunnel?

02:53:51.108 --> 02:53:52.735
LIAM: (breathing heavily) <i>Ja.</i>

02:53:52.735 --> 02:53:57.904
SAM: Are you okay? Do you need healing? Because
Caduceus can heal you.

02:53:57.904 --> 02:53:59.129
LAURA: He's really good at it.

02:53:59.129 --> 02:54:02.566
TALIESIN: I really actually have a-- it'd be
easier if I could see where I am or--

02:54:02.566 --> 02:54:03.905
SAM: Oh, sorry!

02:54:03.905 --> 02:54:07.633
LIAM: I cast Dancing Lights and the four globules
start floating around in the air.

02:54:07.633 --> 02:54:09.354
TALIESIN: Oh, that's much better.

02:54:09.354 --> 02:54:15.812
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Okay, Frumpkin. Would you like to--
are you still there? And he's still on the other

02:54:15.812 --> 02:54:20.391
side. I'm going to have a quick look. Somebody--

02:54:20.391 --> 02:54:21.926
SAM: Here you are.

02:54:21.926 --> 02:54:24.303
LIAM: And I send Frumpkin further in.

02:54:24.303 --> 02:54:29.313
MATT: Okay. As Frumpkin pulls his way through the
tunnel, slowly the tentacles unfurling and

02:54:29.313 --> 02:54:39.508
dragging him forward through this slick, somewhat
slimy algae grooved tube. It goes on for about a

02:54:39.508 --> 02:54:44.134
good 150 feet before it meets another grate.

02:54:44.134 --> 02:54:54.120
LIAM: At this point I can't send in-- I can only
watch, but I did tell him to go. So what would

02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:56.573
you-- well it's up to you what Frumpkin would
interpret that as.

02:54:56.573 --> 02:54:58.467
MATT: All right, so you can't watch at this
distance?

02:54:58.467 --> 02:55:00.377
LIAM: Well I think what we've established--

02:55:00.377 --> 02:55:01.934
MATT: Oh, you can view, but you cannot give
actions.

02:55:01.934 --> 02:55:05.330
LIAM: I can view, but I can't give commands. But I
said to go in, so it's up to you what--

02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:09.728
MATT: So Frumpkin comes to this next grate. Go
ahead and make a strength check for Frumpkin.

02:55:09.728 --> 02:55:17.114
LIAM: That is-- oh, for Frumpkin. So I need to go
to a different tag. That's a three.

02:55:17.114 --> 02:55:22.429
MATT: It's a three. Frumpkin is unable to push
past that secondary grate and fighting with it for

02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:27.411
a bit, returns to you within range to communicate
and tells you there's no further to that tunnel.

02:55:27.411 --> 02:55:28.717
LIAM: Okay.

02:55:28.717 --> 02:55:31.056
LAURA: You never know.

02:55:31.056 --> 02:55:35.004
LIAM: Who knows. Maybe Fjord could swim down there
if we could get this gate open, but.

02:55:35.004 --> 02:55:38.902
TRAVIS: It's a real small tunnel. I'm not looking
to Shawshank my way down that thing.

02:55:38.902 --> 02:55:41.337
LIAM: Yeah, but you are a bean pole.

02:55:41.337 --> 02:55:45.319
TRAVIS: I am not. I am actually quite stocky,
thank you very much.

02:55:45.319 --> 02:55:46.094
LIAM: Stocky?

02:55:46.094 --> 02:55:48.430
TRAVIS: Yeah. I am ripped to fuck.

02:55:48.430 --> 02:55:50.556
LIAM: How many stones do you weigh?

02:55:50.556 --> 02:55:51.698
TRAVIS: So many.

02:55:51.698 --> 02:55:53.910
MARISHA: What size are the stones? Just curious.

02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:59.242
LIAM: They're a pound each. What are you talking
about? I'm talking about--

02:55:59.242 --> 02:56:00.442
LAURA: What?

02:56:00.442 --> 02:56:02.733
TRAVIS: Perhaps we should continue.

02:56:02.733 --> 02:56:05.974
TALIESIN: I just tap the stone. Ten hit points.

02:56:05.974 --> 02:56:09.197
MARISHA: Wait. Is he ten stones?

02:56:09.197 --> 02:56:13.091
TRAVIS: Where does this tunnel go?

02:56:13.091 --> 02:56:17.695
LAURA: Where does that next tunnel go?

02:56:17.695 --> 02:56:18.987
ASHLEY: The other one?

02:56:18.987 --> 02:56:22.176
MATT: The one that had to be there? Go ahead and
make a perception check.

02:56:22.176 --> 02:56:24.939
LAURA: Splash, splash, splash.

02:56:24.939 --> 02:56:26.834
TRAVIS: Yasha, you do it.

02:56:26.834 --> 02:56:38.282
ASHLEY: Okay. I got a five.

02:56:38.282 --> 02:56:43.179
MATT: It's a lot of water ahead. And some walls.

02:56:43.179 --> 02:56:47.125
ASHLEY: It's just a lot of water and I think just
more stone walls.

02:56:47.125 --> 02:56:49.084
TRAVIS: Nothing treacherous?

02:56:49.084 --> 02:56:50.788
MARISHA: That's very astute.

02:56:50.788 --> 02:56:51.890
ASHLEY: I don't think it's bad.

02:56:51.890 --> 02:56:57.304
TALIESIN: Is there an intense discoloration,
maybe, of the mold underneath the grate? Is it a

02:56:57.304 --> 02:56:59.202
different kind of--

02:56:59.202 --> 02:57:00.924
MATT: Oh, on the smaller one, you mean?

02:57:00.924 --> 02:57:01.536
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:57:01.536 --> 02:57:03.604
MATT: Make a nature check.

02:57:03.604 --> 02:57:08.314
LAURA: I'm going to kick through the barrel while
he's doing that. Did I find a gold?

02:57:08.314 --> 02:57:15.348
MATT: It breaks fairly easy. The wood is very
soaked and warped. And as your foot breaks through

02:57:15.348 --> 02:57:20.065
it, it's now up to the knee inside of the barrel.
Doesn't shatter, you're now stuck with your leg

02:57:20.065 --> 02:57:21.631
partially in a barrel.

02:57:21.631 --> 02:57:22.687
TALIESIN: You're so good.

02:57:22.687 --> 02:57:26.511
ASHLEY: And you guys already checked the pillar
for any--

02:57:26.511 --> 02:57:29.487
TRAVIS: We looked around for writing and stuff,
but.

02:57:29.487 --> 02:57:31.367
ASHLEY: Can I give the pillar a look-see?

02:57:31.367 --> 02:57:35.213
MATT: Make an investigation check. You eventually
pull your foot out of the barrel and look inside.

02:57:35.213 --> 02:57:45.300
In it, the smell in there is of deep briny ocean
and possibly something that long rotted and has

02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:50.152
since given this faint scent of earth and decay.

02:57:50.152 --> 02:57:53.948
SAM: Caduceus, you might want that.

02:57:53.948 --> 02:57:57.482
TRAVIS: No. God, no.

02:57:57.482 --> 02:57:58.550
ASHLEY: 17.

02:57:58.550 --> 02:58:04.128
MATT: You feel your way around the exterior of the
column. Glancing around, you don't see any

02:58:04.128 --> 02:58:10.696
particular signs of there being anything
different, beyond the construction of the rest of

02:58:10.696 --> 02:58:16.479
the chamber. Nothing hidden, no language or
discerning characteristics.

02:58:16.479 --> 02:58:18.114
ASHLEY: Nothing strange.

02:58:18.114 --> 02:58:19.664
LAURA: Let's keep booking.

02:58:19.664 --> 02:58:22.540
LIAM: Remind me, it just keeps going forward? Oh
no, Frumpkin, no!

02:58:22.540 --> 02:58:23.440
MATT: Correct.

02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:26.461
LIAM: In the same way there's another large grate
at the end of the passage?

02:58:26.461 --> 02:58:30.565
MATT: There's no grate, it's just another
continuation of the tunnel. The same size of the

02:58:30.565 --> 02:58:32.060
one that you entered this chamber from.

02:58:32.060 --> 02:58:33.143
LIAM: So a tunnel going forward.

02:58:33.143 --> 02:58:33.760
MATT: Yeah.

02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:35.179
TRAVIS: We keep going.

02:58:35.179 --> 02:58:37.897
MARISHA: And we're heading inward, right?

02:58:37.897 --> 02:58:38.697
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:58:38.697 --> 02:58:39.634
MARISHA: Okay.

02:58:39.634 --> 02:58:41.937
MATT: All right. So what's the marching order?

02:58:41.937 --> 02:58:44.885
MARISHA: Am I still big? How much longer am I big
Beau?

02:58:44.885 --> 02:58:46.205
LIAM: You're done.

02:58:46.205 --> 02:58:47.060
MARISHA: Aw.

02:58:47.060 --> 02:58:48.823
TRAVIS: I'll take the front, with my darkvision.

02:58:48.823 --> 02:58:50.663
ASHLEY: I'll go behind Fjord.

02:58:50.663 --> 02:58:53.103
MATT: We have Fjord in front, we have Yasha behind
that.

02:58:53.103 --> 02:58:59.309
LIAM: I will go in the back, but I will send
Frumpkin 80 or 90 feet in front of all of us and

02:58:59.309 --> 02:59:03.018
conga line behind whoever is second to last.

02:59:03.018 --> 02:59:05.770
MATT: All right, Frumpkin goes on ahead.

02:59:05.770 --> 02:59:08.049
MARISHA: Are you still blind without your
cantrip?

02:59:08.049 --> 02:59:11.491
LIAM: With Frumpkin looking. When I'm looking
through Frumpkin I'm blind, yeah.

02:59:11.491 --> 02:59:13.372
MATT: Caduceus, and Jester.

02:59:13.372 --> 02:59:15.031
SAM: Nott's in the back.

02:59:15.031 --> 02:59:16.940
MATT: Nott's in the back with Caleb, all righty.

02:59:16.940 --> 02:59:21.339
MARISHA: I'll be in front of Caleb and be his
train.

02:59:21.339 --> 02:59:23.359
LIAM: Where's little Beau? Little Beau is
missing!

02:59:23.359 --> 02:59:24.842
MATT: That's right. Little Beau is right there.

02:59:24.842 --> 02:59:25.897
ASHLEY: Bitty Beau.

02:59:25.897 --> 02:59:26.815
SAM: Little Beau.

02:59:26.815 --> 02:59:27.912
MARISHA: Bee bo!

02:59:27.912 --> 02:59:29.649
MATT: So Caleb's in the very back.

02:59:29.649 --> 02:59:30.343
LIAM: Yeah.

02:59:30.343 --> 02:59:31.657
MATT: Who's next, Nott, or?

02:59:31.657 --> 02:59:35.110
LIAM: I think Beau is offering to not let me fall,
faceplant.

02:59:35.110 --> 02:59:36.839
SAM: I'm right next to him.

02:59:36.839 --> 02:59:37.728
MATT: Okay.

02:59:37.728 --> 02:59:44.269
LAURA: And Nugget's going to run up and try to
bite and play with Frumpkin.

02:59:44.269 --> 02:59:52.303
MATT: Okay. So as you're making your way through
the water, this puppy is trying to dog paddle from

02:59:52.303 --> 02:59:55.443
the foot and a half of water "(whimpering)."

02:59:55.443 --> 03:00:03.811
LAURA: Oh shit, it's a foot and a half. Nugget,
come back here. Blink to me, darling, blink to me!

03:00:03.813 --> 03:00:05.675
MATT: Roll an animal handling check.

03:00:05.675 --> 03:00:08.288
LIAM: Also, you have to train your animal to
harass mine.

03:00:08.288 --> 03:00:13.544
LAURA: Ooh! That is a 23!

03:00:13.544 --> 03:00:15.830
MATT: You're starting to get this connection
between you.

03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:17.814
LAURA: Blink to me, Nugget!

03:00:17.814 --> 03:00:23.227
MATT: Blinks into your arm and you grasp it, now
soaked in water. It begins licking up your chin

03:00:23.227 --> 03:00:24.618
and getting excited.

03:00:24.618 --> 03:00:25.834
SAM: You got your weasel on your back?

03:00:25.834 --> 03:00:26.565
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:26.565 --> 03:00:30.681
MATT: The two waterlogged pets right now are
flanking her throat. What could possibly go wrong?

03:00:30.681 --> 03:00:31.930
LIAM: You doubled down from the last campaign,
didn't you?

03:00:31.992 --> 03:00:33.929
MATT: You didn't have to buy it.

03:00:33.929 --> 03:00:35.827
TRAVIS: I know we didn't!

03:00:35.827 --> 03:00:39.396
SAM: Jester, you're starting to smell like Caleb.

03:00:39.396 --> 03:00:40.749
LAURA: (gasps)

03:00:40.749 --> 03:00:46.726
SAM: Wet dog and wet weasel. All over your neck.

03:00:46.749 --> 03:00:48.973
LAURA: I'll take a really good bath when we get
back.

03:00:48.985 --> 03:00:50.493
TRAVIS: We move on.

03:00:50.493 --> 03:00:54.458
SAM: Your knee smells bad.

03:00:54.550 --> 03:00:55.729
LAURA: Oh no!

03:00:55.740 --> 03:00:57.186
TRAVIS: Yeah, you stank.

03:00:57.186 --> 03:00:58.542
LAURA: No!

03:00:58.542 --> 03:01:03.381
MATT: Moving forward.

03:01:03.381 --> 03:01:05.031
LIAM: Caleb is laughing quietly in the dark.

03:01:05.031 --> 03:01:06.318
MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

03:01:06.318 --> 03:01:07.579
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> okay.

03:01:07.579 --> 03:01:09.127
MATT: In the octopus form.

03:01:09.127 --> 03:01:11.043
LIAM: Ooh, that's good. 18.

03:01:11.043 --> 03:01:20.904
MATT: Moving on ahead for about another 80 to 100
feet down this long tunnel, it opens up into

03:01:20.904 --> 03:01:26.333
another chamber that's larger than the one you
were previously in. It seems to curve open

03:01:26.333 --> 03:01:32.394
slightly for about ten or so feet, and then opens
even wider. It's a large cube-shaped chamber, the

03:01:32.518 --> 03:01:34.962
same water level, resting at about a foot, foot
and a half up.

03:01:34.962 --> 03:01:39.907
LIAM: I would whisper that into Beauregard's ears,
not being able to hear her, and tell her to hold

03:01:39.907 --> 03:01:41.429
the group up for a moment.

03:01:41.429 --> 03:01:42.540
MARISHA: Hold.

03:01:42.540 --> 03:01:47.846
LIAM: I describe the room. I don't know what's in
there yet, but something's changing.

03:01:47.846 --> 03:01:50.626
MARISHA: Big square room, gets bigger, it's
changing.

03:01:50.626 --> 03:02:03.957
MATT: You see three grates that are similar in
size to the ones that blocked your entryway.

03:02:03.957 --> 03:02:09.335
There's one on the right, one on the left, and
then one on the far end across from you where the

03:02:09.335 --> 03:02:14.241
chamber seems to end. However, there are two
platforms that are raised up about ten feet above,

03:02:14.241 --> 03:02:22.284
with a very small railing and two pathways that
vanish further in. There's a raised two watch

03:02:22.284 --> 03:02:25.646
points that protrude out and look over the smaller
part of this chamber.

03:02:25.646 --> 03:02:28.498
LIAM: Three water passages and then two hallways
that are dry?

03:02:28.498 --> 03:02:30.070
MARISHA: Like balconies?

03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:33.497
MATT: Like balconies that protrude from the far
wall to overlook the interior of this chamber.

03:02:33.497 --> 03:02:37.058
MARISHA: Do the balconies go all the way across?
Sorry, I'm not asking Caleb or anything.

03:02:37.058 --> 03:02:42.378
MATT: They push out about ten feet from the wall
before they come to an end. So they're more of a--

03:02:42.378 --> 03:02:43.520
TRAVIS: More balcony terraces?

03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:46.768
MATT: Yeah, they're not beautifully designed, per
se. They're made of the same stonework, but they

03:02:46.768 --> 03:02:50.274
look to be positions to supervise the interior of
the chamber.

03:02:50.274 --> 03:02:56.116
LIAM: DM, you're describing those platforms, but
then there are passageways further leading in.

03:02:56.116 --> 03:03:07.219
MATT: Correct. There is a very faint, dull,
teal-green glow underneath the water in the far

03:03:07.219 --> 03:03:08.825
center of the chamber.

03:03:08.825 --> 03:03:11.492
LIAM: I mutter that to Beauregard.

03:03:11.492 --> 03:03:16.780
MATT: There is also a faint mist that drifts over
the surface of the chamber in here.

03:03:16.780 --> 03:03:23.697
LIAM: This room looks kind of fucked up. We should not
rush into it.

03:03:23.697 --> 03:03:25.695
MARISHA: Do you see any movement? I ask Caleb.

03:03:25.695 --> 03:03:27.484
SAM: The water can fly now.

03:03:27.484 --> 03:03:34.185
LIAM: It's eerie, but do I see any living
creatures or threats?

03:03:34.185 --> 03:03:36.371
MATT: Currently no movement, no creatures.

03:03:36.371 --> 03:03:38.390
LAURA: Oh no.

03:03:38.390 --> 03:03:42.034
MARISHA: It's everywhere!

03:03:42.034 --> 03:03:49.714
LIAM: My cat doesn't see anything, but I don't
trust that there's-- are you listening to me?

03:03:49.714 --> 03:03:50.994
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:03:50.994 --> 03:04:06.496
LIAM: Tap me on the shoulder if you're listening
to me. Okay. Ow. God. We don't see anything, but I

03:04:06.496 --> 03:04:08.067
have a bad feeling.

03:04:08.067 --> 03:04:12.720
MARISHA: He has a bad feeling. Like something in
your lower parts of your intestines?

03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:18.529
LIAM: Frumpkin, come back. The room ahead is not
good.

03:04:18.529 --> 03:04:22.403
LAURA: Like monsters, more of those water things?

03:04:22.403 --> 03:04:25.806
LIAM: No. There's something of a magical nature up
there.

03:04:25.806 --> 03:04:27.501
TRAVIS: How deep did the water look?

03:04:27.501 --> 03:04:29.582
LIAM: Frumpkin would have seen that, as would I.

03:04:29.582 --> 03:04:32.168
MATT: It's similar, about a foot and a half or
so.

03:04:32.168 --> 03:04:34.440
MARISHA: What makes you think it's magical?

03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:35.928
LIAM: It's glowing.

03:04:35.928 --> 03:04:44.734
LAURA: Maybe we could get up to those little
terraces or something and avoid it. Can anybody

03:04:44.734 --> 03:04:46.143
walk on walls?

03:04:46.143 --> 03:04:47.511
SAM: I can walk on water.

03:04:47.511 --> 03:04:50.367
TRAVIS: I could get up there.

03:04:50.367 --> 03:04:52.937
MARISHA: I'm pretty good at actually climbing.

03:04:52.937 --> 03:04:58.987
LIAM: Well, yeah, but you're assuming that
nothing's going to happen when you get into the

03:04:58.987 --> 03:05:00.074
room or close to the room.

03:05:00.074 --> 03:05:03.556
LAURA: What if we don't touch the water? What if
all of us hang on the side of the walls and move

03:05:03.556 --> 03:05:05.033
around the room?

03:05:05.033 --> 03:05:06.649
LIAM: I am hearing a lot of what ifs.

03:05:06.649 --> 03:05:14.688
TRAVIS: Can we move to the mouth of the room? So
still within the tunnel, not going into the full

03:05:14.688 --> 03:05:16.929
space yet, but able to see in and up.

03:05:16.929 --> 03:05:24.434
MATT: Yeah. Moving up to the very edge of it, you
can see the interior of this chamber and the

03:05:24.434 --> 03:05:31.795
display that Caleb had described. Caduceus, as you
guys are stepping up, you hear this faint echoing

03:05:31.795 --> 03:05:38.971
sound emerging from the upper left hallway. You
see a very faint bit of light coming, and you hear

03:05:38.971 --> 03:05:40.686
talking.

03:05:40.686 --> 03:05:42.901
MARISHA: This is through Frumpkin?

03:05:42.901 --> 03:05:44.887
MATT: No, this is Caduceus.

03:05:44.887 --> 03:05:52.545
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace. Do I have
that? I do. Yeah, I cast Pass Without a Trace on

03:05:52.545 --> 03:05:53.307
all of us.

03:05:53.307 --> 03:05:55.134
LIAM: I'm casting Mage Armor.

03:05:55.134 --> 03:06:00.330
LAURA: We're going to stealth, right? Because I
just cast it on all of us.

03:06:00.330 --> 03:06:02.722
MATT: Roll some stealth checks.

03:06:02.722 --> 03:06:05.391
TRAVIS: Plus ten?

03:06:05.391 --> 03:06:08.338
LAURA: Yeah, and I give Caduceus the Blessing of
the Trickster.

03:06:08.338 --> 03:06:10.853
MATT: All right, everyone make stealth checks,
please.

03:06:10.853 --> 03:06:11.920
LAURA: You get advantage.

03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:13.103
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

03:06:13.103 --> 03:06:15.320
LAURA: Add ten.

03:06:15.320 --> 03:06:19.177
TALIESIN: 27.

03:06:19.177 --> 03:06:21.572
TRAVIS: 26.

03:06:21.572 --> 03:06:23.256
LAURA: 19.

03:06:23.256 --> 03:06:24.460
ASHLEY: 15.

03:06:24.460 --> 03:06:25.636
LIAM: 14.

03:06:25.636 --> 03:06:26.966
SAM: 38.

03:06:26.966 --> 03:06:29.558
MARISHA: 24.

03:06:29.558 --> 03:06:31.695
TALIESIN: You're in another game.

03:06:31.695 --> 03:06:41.653
MATT: You all quietly get low into the water and
off to the sides of the entrance to best stay out

03:06:41.653 --> 03:06:47.116
of range of the light source. You guys feel pretty
confident that you are, for the most part, out of

03:06:47.116 --> 03:06:53.296
range of anyone who isn't fairly perceptive. You
can see the faint dull glow from the center far

03:06:53.296 --> 03:07:02.155
end of the chamber. Now that you're closer and can
see, there are two similar pillars in the center

03:07:02.155 --> 03:07:06.764
of the room. The last room you were in, they were
just load-bearing center bits. There are some

03:07:06.764 --> 03:07:13.777
small elements of almost walkways or little bits
of stone that emerge from the far wall, and the

03:07:13.777 --> 03:07:18.654
corners that either rubble has built up or it's
been intentionally built as some sort of platform

03:07:18.654 --> 03:07:20.616
there. That's off the water.

03:07:20.616 --> 03:07:26.214
MARISHA: Why would they have a patrol in a sewer
system?

03:07:26.214 --> 03:07:33.826
MATT: At this point, you see the light emerge from
that side and you hear the voice say, "The

03:07:33.826 --> 03:07:38.347
"complaints are driving me up the wall. Zsundie is
going to get an earful if he's slacking on those

03:07:38.347 --> 03:07:39.617
"engines."

03:07:39.617 --> 03:07:41.966
LIAM, SAM, AND MARISHA: Zsundie?

03:07:41.966 --> 03:07:50.067
MATT: At this point you watch on the left side,
the upper area, holding a lantern, Algar emerges.

03:07:50.067 --> 03:07:51.570
ALL: (gasping)

03:07:51.570 --> 03:07:59.240
MATT: Looks over the platform there, flanked by a
worker of these tunnels who's wearing a simple

03:07:59.240 --> 03:08:07.299
leather frock with gloves, and is listening to him
and walking up beside. His two dwarven bodyguards

03:08:07.299 --> 03:08:15.044
are beside the two of them as they approach and
look over the side. He looks over the edge, the

03:08:15.044 --> 03:08:21.450
small railing, and looks into the water and goes,
"Oh, he's sleeping." Holds up his left arm and

03:08:21.450 --> 03:08:31.475
begins this, "Zsundie! Stand to attention, you
frustrating water spout!" The glow begins to pulse

03:08:31.475 --> 03:08:36.450
and the water bows a bit above. I'm going to
whisper something to you.

03:08:36.450 --> 03:08:42.019
TALIESIN: Okay, because I was like ten seconds
away from casting Eyes of the Grave.

03:08:42.019 --> 03:08:44.101
SAM: Whispers!

03:08:44.101 --> 03:08:46.092
LAURA: I want to listen, but I shouldn't listen.

03:08:46.092 --> 03:08:47.975
TRAVIS: Guys, our NYC live show!

03:08:47.975 --> 03:08:52.088
SAM: Tickets are still on sale, orchestra seats,
very few left.

03:08:52.088 --> 03:08:56.306
TRAVIS: East coast, come bring it! Boston,
Massachusetts.

03:08:56.306 --> 03:08:58.519
MARISHA: Balcony seats, though. Good view!

03:08:58.519 --> 03:09:00.080
SAM: Who knows what will happen at the live show?

03:09:00.080 --> 03:09:07.819
MATT: As the water bows up, you see it burst like
a bubble, and there, emerging from that space below

03:09:07.819 --> 03:09:15.885
where it was, you see something that looks like an
impressively large aquatic humanoid, their chest

03:09:15.885 --> 03:09:23.224
and torso rather rotund, their skin a blue-green
color, long thin arms that end in somewhat webbed,

03:09:23.224 --> 03:09:28.848
clawed fingers. Their face somewhat fish-like,
with a wide mouth and small fins that crest the

03:09:28.848 --> 03:09:34.738
head. The lower half of its body seems obscured by
rushing water at first, but then as it comes to

03:09:34.738 --> 03:09:40.335
its full stance at about seven, eight foot tall,
you notice that the lower half of its body is just

03:09:40.335 --> 03:09:45.464
water. It's a constant swirling whirlwind, similar
to the creatures you were fighting in the previous

03:09:45.464 --> 03:09:54.030
chamber. That dull glow seems to emanate from most
of its torso in this darkened chamber, and it

03:09:54.030 --> 03:09:57.473
gives this faint light source by its very
presence.

03:09:57.473 --> 03:10:07.457
It has a small vest on, and sets of jewelry,
including this thick metal band that hangs like a

03:10:07.457 --> 03:10:16.352
presentory necklace around its throat. It turns
and looks up and says, "At your service." It seems

03:10:16.352 --> 03:10:22.294
to say with an undertone of exasperation and
eyeroll. Algar screams out to it again. "The

03:10:22.294 --> 03:10:27.838
"Archway craftsman are complaining of cold furnaces
and slow bellows. Please ensure enough water is

03:10:27.838 --> 03:10:32.367
"being spun through the engines into the district."
He snaps his fingers really tightly on his left

03:10:32.367 --> 03:10:39.540
hand. With a low grunt of brimming hatred, the
creature raises its arms and a large stationary

03:10:39.540 --> 03:10:46.430
wave of water rises from the depths beside it. The
liquid seems to form once more and there's a

03:10:46.430 --> 03:10:54.277
slight sparkle of energy around its hands, and
this second bowing forms into a large curved wave

03:10:54.277 --> 03:10:59.056
that seems to be perpetually crashing and then
filling itself, similar to the creatures you just

03:10:59.056 --> 03:11:08.190
fought, but a much larger scale. It whips into its
full form and where the head would be bends and

03:11:08.190 --> 03:11:13.415
shifts-- almost elements out of the movie The
Abyss-- as it turns toward this figure being

03:11:13.415 --> 03:11:22.846
referred to as Zsundie. It spins around and looks
up towards the supervisor and his troupe. "Thy will

03:11:22.846 --> 03:11:33.139
"is my bond." The two of them begin to turn and
shift towards the left hand grate in the chamber.

03:11:33.139 --> 03:11:38.542
TRAVIS: What is the distance from where we are to
the terrace balcony space that they're on?

03:11:38.542 --> 03:11:47.548
MATT: I'd say roughly 80 or so feet. At this point,
Zsundie comes to a stop and looks over his

03:11:47.548 --> 03:11:58.583
shoulder in your direction and goes, "Oh.
Intruders." Algar shouts off, "What? How?" and

03:11:58.583 --> 03:12:03.172
holds up his lantern and focuses the beam over
across the way there. You guys, even though you're

03:12:03.172 --> 03:12:08.197
up against the wall, there's nothing to hide
behind. The light pushes past a few of you and

03:12:08.197 --> 03:12:11.987
then stops. He shouts off, "Dispatch them
quickly!"

03:12:11.987 --> 03:12:14.914
MARISHA: Who says that? Zsundie?

03:12:14.914 --> 03:12:18.763
MATT: Algar shouts it off to Zsundie down below.
Let's roll initiative.

03:12:18.763 --> 03:12:22.929
LAURA: How far away is Algar from us?

03:12:22.929 --> 03:12:25.080
MATT: You will see in a second.

03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:27.810
MARISHA: Maybe we can talk to him? He seemed like
a genie.

03:12:27.810 --> 03:12:29.452
LAURA: I bet it's his necklace.

03:12:29.452 --> 03:12:34.114
MARISHA: It feels like a genie circumstance,
right?

03:12:34.114 --> 03:12:35.629
SAM: Wait, who has a necklace? Algar?

03:12:35.629 --> 03:12:37.664
LAURA: Zsundie has a necklace on and he's like--

03:12:37.664 --> 03:12:40.329
ASHLEY: "My will is my bond."

03:12:40.329 --> 03:12:44.515
MARISHA: I don't want to fight this guy. Let's try
and talk to him.

03:12:44.515 --> 03:12:46.524
SAM: You don't want to fight this guy?

03:12:46.524 --> 03:12:48.024
TALIESIN: Well, there's an easy way to deal with
this.

03:12:48.024 --> 03:12:49.758
LAURA: Not Zsundie, I want to fight Algar.

03:12:49.758 --> 03:12:51.062
MARISHA: Yeah, we want to kill Algar.

03:12:51.062 --> 03:12:53.684
TALIESIN: Algar's got a control mechanism, I
think.

03:12:53.684 --> 03:12:56.843
SAM: Are you Taliesin right now?

03:12:56.856 --> 03:12:58.041
TALIESIN: No.

03:12:58.041 --> 03:13:01.344
(laughter)

03:13:01.344 --> 03:13:03.164
SAM: Matt's gone, I guess. Oh, he's back!

03:13:03.164 --> 03:13:05.112
MATT: Excuse me for a moment of preparation here.

03:13:05.112 --> 03:13:14.058
SAM: That's real water. And colored lights!

03:13:14.058 --> 03:13:20.590
MATT: This is the difficulty of doing this.

03:13:20.590 --> 03:13:22.328
LAURA: Oh, Melora.

03:13:22.328 --> 03:13:26.581
TRAVIS: This is dope, man! Yeah!

03:13:26.581 --> 03:13:30.295
LAURA: Did you think we were going to get to
this?

03:13:30.295 --> 03:13:34.080
MATT: I didn't know if you were. This is the
difficulty of doing this in here.

03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:35.633
SAM: Dungeons & Dragons just broke!

03:13:35.633 --> 03:13:38.467
MATT: I know, that's all right. We will fix this,
guys.

03:13:38.467 --> 03:13:44.949
LAURA: You sounded like Bob Ross as he was saying
that. It's all happening nicely.

03:13:44.949 --> 03:13:48.004
TRAVIS: It's so worth it.

03:13:48.004 --> 03:13:53.047
MATT: And with that, guys--

03:13:53.047 --> 03:13:56.771
ASHLEY: Give it to me now.

03:13:56.771 --> 03:14:05.301
MATT: I'd like you guys to place yourselves, if
you can, where you would be on this side of the

03:14:05.301 --> 03:14:09.524
chamber as you enter. There is Zsundie.

03:14:09.524 --> 03:14:12.135
ASHLEY: Oh, what? He's awesome-looking.

03:14:12.135 --> 03:14:18.838
MATT: And there is the large elemental where you
had seen him. The worker has run past and vanished

03:14:18.838 --> 03:14:26.087
into the chamber before, and there on the top,
looking over the terrace, the dwarven bodyguards

03:14:26.087 --> 03:14:30.231
right there. And that's Algar right there.

03:14:30.231 --> 03:14:31.530
SAM: He's the tall one?

03:14:31.530 --> 03:14:33.169
MATT: Yeah, he's the tall one right there.

03:14:33.169 --> 03:14:35.924
LIAM: Matt, I'm putting Frumpkin in this corner.

03:14:35.924 --> 03:14:37.110
TRAVIS: We're not in the room, right?

03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:40.619
LAURA: No, we haven't come in yet. We were all
hiding in this little thing. I'm putting you in

03:14:40.619 --> 03:14:41.951
the back, Nott.

03:14:41.951 --> 03:14:43.839
SAM: Sure. I mean, yeah.

03:14:43.839 --> 03:14:46.065
LIAM: Yeah, that was our lineup.

03:14:46.065 --> 03:14:49.476
LAURA: So you can hop up. Oh, that's true. That
was our lineup.

03:14:49.476 --> 03:14:52.898
SAM: I was stealthing so hard, I'm playing with
the McElroys right now.

03:14:52.898 --> 03:14:56.279
LAURA: So how far is that?

03:14:56.279 --> 03:15:02.514
MATT: For that right there? To Algar, from you?

03:15:02.514 --> 03:15:09.229
Somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70
feet. You're not entirely sure.

03:15:09.229 --> 03:15:11.198
MARISHA: You said roll for initiative?

03:15:11.198 --> 03:15:12.609
LIAM: Yeah, got to roll for initiative.

03:15:12.609 --> 03:15:14.094
MATT: Yeah, roll for initiative, guys.

03:15:14.094 --> 03:15:15.644
TALIESIN: Oh god. Shit.

03:15:15.644 --> 03:15:18.492
MARISHA: Going to use my boots.

03:15:18.492 --> 03:15:22.715
TALIESIN: Woo!

03:15:22.715 --> 03:15:29.745
[dramatic music]

03:15:29.745 --> 03:15:31.934
LAURA: (humming along)

03:15:31.934 --> 03:15:34.421
MATT: This isn't working, but that's fine.

03:15:34.421 --> 03:15:40.840
MARISHA: Not too bad.

03:15:40.840 --> 03:16:02.376
TALIESIN: You know, I think one of the bits isn't
turning on. It should be just about

03:16:02.490 --> 03:16:03.953
instantaneous.

03:16:03.953 --> 03:16:05.500
MATT: Yeah. Oh well.

03:16:05.500 --> 03:16:06.686
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:16:06.686 --> 03:16:08.337
LAURA: They have high constitution, that's what
you said?

03:16:08.337 --> 03:16:15.107
MARISHA: The water elemental that I rolled against
had a plus three to its constitution.

03:16:15.107 --> 03:16:18.819
LAURA: So they probably have pretty high.

03:16:18.819 --> 03:16:27.095
MARISHA: Maybe. I can find out, though, if I hit
twice in a row. If there are any stats that are

03:16:27.095 --> 03:16:33.072
beneficial to any of your guys' abilities, let me
know. If you want to know, if you want to take the risk.

03:16:33.072 --> 03:16:43.487
MATT: Oh well. It's fine. Wonders of live. Well,
for the time being, we'll just take this aside.

03:16:43.487 --> 03:16:45.921
Save it for another day.

03:16:45.921 --> 03:16:47.197
ALL: No!

03:16:47.197 --> 03:16:49.796
SAM: Matt! Come on. Let's get some crew people.

03:16:49.796 --> 03:16:53.446
MATT: I don't have time to troubleshoot right now
and tonight's been moving quickly.

03:16:53.446 --> 03:16:56.469
MARISHA: Steve, you're the best. Wait, it's
going?

03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:59.026
MATT: It's not misting--

03:16:59.026 --> 03:17:00.509
LIAM: Bong rip this shit!

03:17:00.509 --> 03:17:06.142
MATT: It's all good. So, top of the line. We have
here, initiatives 25 to 20?

03:17:06.142 --> 03:17:08.131
SAM and TRAVIS: 21.

03:17:08.131 --> 03:17:09.152
MATT: Oh, wow!

03:17:09.152 --> 03:17:10.408
TRAVIS: Oh no, I'm just repeating what Nott said.

03:17:10.408 --> 03:17:11.641
MATT: Okay, got you.

03:17:11.641 --> 03:17:12.942
TRAVIS: I don't know why I did that.

03:17:12.942 --> 03:17:14.460
LIAM: Yeah, definitely 21.

03:17:14.460 --> 03:17:16.362
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

03:17:16.362 --> 03:17:17.907
MARISHA and SAM: 19.

03:17:17.907 --> 03:17:19.336
TRAVIS: 16.

03:17:19.336 --> 03:17:21.045
TALIESIN: 17.

03:17:21.045 --> 03:17:22.550
ASHLEY: 15.

03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:26.025
ASHLEY, LAURA, and MARISHA: Ay!

03:17:26.025 --> 03:17:27.568
SAM: Say all those again.

03:17:27.568 --> 03:17:28.661
MATT: So--

03:17:28.661 --> 03:17:31.461
TRAVIS: It goes Nott, Beau, Caduceus, Fjord,
Yasha.

03:17:31.461 --> 03:17:33.895
MARISHA: Wait, no. I thought it was Fjord,
Caduceus, Yasha?

03:17:33.895 --> 03:17:37.087
TRAVIS: I know I'm 16. Yasha's 15.

03:17:37.087 --> 03:17:38.984
ASHLEY: 15.

03:17:38.984 --> 03:17:40.641
MARISHA: What did you have, Caduceus?

03:17:40.641 --> 03:17:41.790
TALIESIN: 17.

03:17:41.790 --> 03:17:45.986
MARISHA: Okay. You're right, I'm sorry! You're
right! I'm wrong!

03:17:45.986 --> 03:17:50.679
LIAM: And we got plenty of light in this room,
correct?

03:17:50.679 --> 03:17:52.288
LAURA: He's glowing.

03:17:52.288 --> 03:17:57.515
MATT: There's a faint glow from there, but there
is not a technical light source beyond the lantern

03:17:57.515 --> 03:18:03.182
here. So this area is torchlight. And then dim
light in that area. So you can see most of the

03:18:03.182 --> 03:18:12.263
chamber in dim light. The closer you get to Algar,
the better vision you have. So we have-- We're

03:18:12.263 --> 03:18:15.535
missing-- What is Caleb and--

03:18:15.535 --> 03:18:16.859
LIAM: Oh, 13. Sorry.

03:18:16.859 --> 03:18:18.062
MATT: All right.

03:18:18.062 --> 03:18:21.876
SAM: Did you go already? Did you say yours?

03:18:21.876 --> 03:18:22.893
ASHLEY: I got 15.

03:18:22.893 --> 03:18:23.906
SAM: Ah!

03:18:23.906 --> 03:18:24.924
TRAVIS: Nice!

03:18:24.924 --> 03:18:26.200
MATT: All right. Jester?

03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:27.395
LAURA: Nine.

03:18:27.395 --> 03:18:29.004
LIAM: Go for the sky, Ash.

03:18:29.004 --> 03:18:34.289
ASHLEY: Shoot for the sky. Where's the little
(clicking sounds)?

03:18:34.289 --> 03:18:35.929
TALIESIN: The flaggy thing?

03:18:35.929 --> 03:18:40.501
MATT: Top of the round: Nott, you're up.

03:18:40.501 --> 03:18:41.772
SAM: I'm up first?

03:18:41.772 --> 03:18:42.783
MATT: Yeah, you're up first.

03:18:42.783 --> 03:18:49.592
SAM: I'm so scared! There's water, water
everywhere and all of it wants to kill me. I will

03:18:49.592 --> 03:18:57.382
scramble ahead and-- Oh, I'm so far away. I'll
scramble ahead and to the left, near where the

03:18:57.382 --> 03:19:02.471
octopus is. Am I within 30 feet of those big
watery things?

03:19:02.471 --> 03:19:07.676
MATT: It looks like you may be. You might be just
out of range for 30 feet.

03:19:07.676 --> 03:19:10.725
SAM: Then I will--

03:19:10.725 --> 03:19:13.873
MATT: You can move a little closer if you want.

03:19:13.873 --> 03:19:22.419
SAM: No fucking way. I will just use my bonus
action to dash and go on the other side of that

03:19:22.419 --> 03:19:27.541
pillar. I guess a little closer, but keeping the
pillar between me and all baddies, if possible.

03:19:27.541 --> 03:19:28.739
MATT: There?

03:19:28.739 --> 03:19:34.692
SAM: Yeah. And hold my action until someone is
engaged.

03:19:34.692 --> 03:19:36.186
MATT: Okay.

03:19:36.186 --> 03:19:37.609
SAM: Do I have to aim at someone?

03:19:37.609 --> 03:19:39.035
MATT: What are you holding? Are you holding an
attack?

03:19:39.035 --> 03:19:44.658
SAM: A crossbow bolt. Until someone is-- they're
engaged with someone of my friends.

03:19:44.658 --> 03:19:49.187
MATT: All right. That ends your go. Beau, you're up
next.

03:19:49.187 --> 03:19:52.836
MARISHA: Which one is Algar?

03:19:52.836 --> 03:19:55.124
LAURA: The fancy one. The tall one.

03:19:55.124 --> 03:19:56.443
MATT: Yes.

03:19:56.443 --> 03:19:58.643
MARISHA: They all look the same when they're
minis.

03:19:58.643 --> 03:20:02.135
MATT: That is Algar. The two dwarves are his--

03:20:02.135 --> 03:20:04.210
MARISHA: Oh, he is taller. You're right.

03:20:04.210 --> 03:20:08.281
SAM: Actually, you know what? I'm sorry, Matt. Can
I undo?

03:20:08.281 --> 03:20:10.105
MATT: Sure, what do you want to do?

03:20:10.105 --> 03:20:11.783
SAM: Can I use my action to just cast Mage Hand?

03:20:11.783 --> 03:20:14.954
MATT: Sure. You go ahead and you cast Mage Hand.

03:20:14.954 --> 03:20:17.791
SAM: Okay. I'm going to put it up near Algar.

03:20:17.791 --> 03:20:20.427
MARISHA: Oh.

03:20:20.427 --> 03:20:22.363
TRAVIS: I got you.

03:20:22.363 --> 03:20:27.061
SAM: Wait, where's the necklace? Is it on Algar or
is it--

03:20:27.061 --> 03:20:30.082
MARISHA: It's on the genie guy.

03:20:30.082 --> 03:20:33.021
TRAVIS: That we can tell. We don't know.

03:20:33.021 --> 03:20:34.824
MARISHA: But Algar might have something.

03:20:34.824 --> 03:20:36.035
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:20:36.035 --> 03:20:38.055
SAM: I'll put it near the genie guy for now,
because that's all I've seen.

03:20:38.055 --> 03:20:39.503
TALIESIN: Algar might have something.

03:20:39.503 --> 03:20:40.789
LAURA: It came off again.

03:20:40.789 --> 03:20:43.644
MARISHA: I don't want to fight the genie guy. I'm
going to go for Algar.

03:20:43.644 --> 03:20:45.080
LAURA: Yeah, go for Algar!

03:20:45.080 --> 03:20:46.342
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to see what I can do.

03:20:46.342 --> 03:20:50.652
TALIESIN: Yes! I'm so proud of you.

03:20:50.652 --> 03:20:54.631
SAM: Matt is repairing an aquarium during our game
tonight.

03:20:54.631 --> 03:20:59.645
TALIESIN: To be fair, there is nothing better than
Dungeons & Aquarium Repair.

03:20:59.645 --> 03:21:01.206
MATT: Now they think that I normally do this.

03:21:01.206 --> 03:21:02.441
TRAVIS: No, we fucking know you do.

03:21:02.441 --> 03:21:04.766
TALIESIN: No, I feel good that you're making this
happen.

03:21:04.766 --> 03:21:05.664
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:21:05.664 --> 03:21:06.684
TALIESIN: Things are looking better.

03:21:06.684 --> 03:21:07.700
LAURA: Oh, things are happening!

03:21:07.700 --> 03:21:12.703
SAM: The water's moving. The fish are getting air.
You know why I love this, guys?

03:21:12.703 --> 03:21:14.681
TRAVIS: If your finger gets cut off I'm going
to--

03:21:14.681 --> 03:21:16.992
SAM: I love this because it's kind of like an
aerator.

03:21:16.992 --> 03:21:19.136
MATT: I don't think that's how it's supposed to
work.

03:21:19.136 --> 03:21:21.968
LIAM: Oh man.

03:21:21.968 --> 03:21:24.255
LAURA: But it looks pretty.

03:21:24.255 --> 03:21:25.874
MARISHA: It was really awesome when the--

03:21:25.874 --> 03:21:28.172
(cheering)

03:21:28.172 --> 03:21:29.685
MARISHA: I still don't think that's supposed to--

03:21:29.685 --> 03:21:30.800
LAURA: Yeah, that's it!

03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:31.936
MARISHA: Is that it? Ay!

03:21:31.936 --> 03:21:33.330
MATT: I did it. I did a thing.

03:21:33.330 --> 03:21:34.212
LAURA: Yay, Matt!

03:21:34.212 --> 03:21:35.061
ASHLEY: Good job, Matt!

03:21:35.061 --> 03:21:35.934
MATT: Thank you guys.

03:21:35.934 --> 03:21:36.942
SAM: Science!

03:21:36.942 --> 03:21:38.342
MATT: Move it forward for me. Thank you. That'll
do.

03:21:38.342 --> 03:21:39.593
MARISHA: (singing) Bill Nye the science guy.

03:21:39.593 --> 03:21:40.805
MATT: I did a thing!

03:21:40.805 --> 03:21:45.051
(cheering)

03:21:45.051 --> 03:21:46.541
TRAVIS: We got fog smoke!

03:21:46.541 --> 03:21:47.798
MARISHA: Look at all that vapor.

03:21:47.798 --> 03:21:49.490
LAURA: Good job, Matthew.

03:21:49.490 --> 03:21:50.568
ASHLEY: Good job.

03:21:50.568 --> 03:21:52.522
MATT: Thank you, guys. Now you get to fight it.

03:21:52.522 --> 03:21:54.703
LAURA and LIAM: (singing) Here it comes!

03:21:54.703 --> 03:21:58.210
TALIESIN: Yup, there it goes!

03:21:58.210 --> 03:21:59.376
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:21:59.376 --> 03:22:00.473
TALIESIN: Nice.

03:22:00.473 --> 03:22:01.881
MARISHA: That smokiness.

03:22:01.881 --> 03:22:04.520
ASHLEY: So scary!

03:22:04.520 --> 03:22:10.845
ALL: Yeah! (laughter)

03:22:10.845 --> 03:22:12.530
TRAVIS: It's the little things, people!

03:22:12.530 --> 03:22:15.898
MATT: The little things, really. All right. So--

03:22:15.898 --> 03:22:17.244
MARISHA: Misty!

03:22:17.244 --> 03:22:18.324
LIAM: Sick, Matt. Sick.

03:22:18.324 --> 03:22:21.531
MATT: Turn that down just a little bit, there. So,
guys--

03:22:21.531 --> 03:22:26.211
ALL: Ooh! (laughter)

03:22:26.211 --> 03:22:28.635
MATT: It was worth it for me. It was worth it.
Thank you for being patient on that one.

03:22:28.635 --> 03:22:30.052
LIAM: We're so happy!

03:22:30.052 --> 03:22:31.256
TRAVIS: So worth it!

03:22:31.256 --> 03:22:32.413
MATT: Beau, what are you doing?

03:22:32.413 --> 03:22:41.637
MARISHA: Okay. I want to do some parkour, awesome
dope monk shit, and be like (repeating) bink. And

03:22:41.637 --> 03:22:43.186
see if I can get to here, 40 feet?

03:22:43.186 --> 03:22:43.961
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:22:43.961 --> 03:22:45.545
MARISHA: Can I do that?

03:22:45.545 --> 03:22:48.908
MATT: Make an acrobatics check. If you want to
try. With disadvantage, because they're slick,

03:22:48.908 --> 03:22:50.031
moist walls.

03:22:50.031 --> 03:22:51.275
LAURA: Moist.

03:22:51.275 --> 03:22:53.087
MARISHA and SAM: Slick and moist.

03:22:53.087 --> 03:23:02.488
MARISHA: Oh! Real good on both ones! I'll take
that 16 from Gil. I take it all back, Gil.

03:23:02.488 --> 03:23:04.939
LIAM and MARISHA: For now.

03:23:04.939 --> 03:23:06.547
MARISHA: We're at 22.

03:23:06.547 --> 03:23:12.639
MATT: I'll allow you to make it as far as here
without using any movement.

03:23:12.639 --> 03:23:14.364
MARISHA: I will accept that.

03:23:14.364 --> 03:23:15.609
MATT: Go for it.

03:23:15.609 --> 03:23:16.787
SAM: You have to accept that.

03:23:16.787 --> 03:23:18.011
MARISHA: Here, you said?

03:23:18.011 --> 03:23:19.046
MATT: Yeah, that's good.

03:23:19.046 --> 03:23:22.165
MARISHA: Do I-- Fuck, but that doesn't give me--

03:23:22.165 --> 03:23:23.439
LAURA: Fuck butt?

03:23:23.439 --> 03:23:30.480
MARISHA: Fuck butt. Do I have any more movement?
(counting) 25? Can I still try and go further one?

03:23:30.480 --> 03:23:33.968
With my 45 feet of movement?

03:23:33.968 --> 03:23:36.941
MATT: Let's say from there-- It's a lot of
movement, but it's also running off of walls that

03:23:36.941 --> 03:23:40.289
don't really-- To land off of it you're going to
have to land this way. I'm thinking

03:23:40.289 --> 03:23:41.288
trajectory-wise.

03:23:41.288 --> 03:23:46.583
MARISHA: Okay I've gone (counting) 20, arguably 25
to 30. Can I just then try and get here?

03:23:46.583 --> 03:23:50.874
MATT: Make a secondary acrobatics check because
you're now running off of two different walls.

03:23:50.874 --> 03:23:53.317
MARISHA: Copy. With still disadvantage?

03:23:53.317 --> 03:23:55.501
MATT: With disadvantage, yeah. Because they're
slick.

03:23:55.501 --> 03:23:58.320
MARISHA: Not as good that time, Gil.

03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:00.930
TRAVIS: You keep putting him in the mix.

03:24:00.930 --> 03:24:01.997
MARISHA: 12.

03:24:01.997 --> 03:24:05.550
MATT: Yeah, that'll put you at there with ten more
feet of movement.

03:24:05.550 --> 03:24:09.990
MARISHA: With ten more feet! Can I be like: Excuse
me. Excuse me, Nott. Sorry.

03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:12.976
MATT: Five, ten? No, because you'd finish your
space-- because you're in the water at that point

03:24:12.976 --> 03:24:14.402
and it's considered--

03:24:14.402 --> 03:24:15.265
TRAVIS: Five.

03:24:15.265 --> 03:24:18.053
MARISHA: Oh, so I can only get-- Can I get behind
her?

03:24:18.053 --> 03:24:21.121
MATT: No, because you'd be occupying the same
space as Nott.

03:24:21.121 --> 03:24:25.376
MARISHA: Well then. And I can't see Algar?

03:24:25.376 --> 03:24:31.535
MATT: You can see Algar, barely. He has
three-quarters cover.

03:24:31.535 --> 03:24:32.784
LAURA: Tug your shirt.

03:24:32.784 --> 03:24:34.306
MATT: There you go.

03:24:34.306 --> 03:24:36.445
SAM: T-shirts are bullshit.

03:24:36.445 --> 03:24:44.703
MARISHA: Fuck it, this is what I worked for. I'm
going to go for it and try and do two shurikens

03:24:44.703 --> 03:24:57.850
right at his face. Three-quarters cover. First one
is a 14 plus seven, so that's a big old 21! And

03:24:57.850 --> 03:25:00.310
then nine plus seven is a big old 16.

03:25:00.310 --> 03:25:01.900
MATT: This is to Algar?

03:25:01.900 --> 03:25:02.850
MARISHA: Yep.

03:25:02.850 --> 03:25:03.616
MATT: Both of them?

03:25:03.616 --> 03:25:04.452
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:25:04.452 --> 03:25:10.397
MATT: All right. With three-quarters cover, that's
going to be a plus five to AC, so his AC is

03:25:10.397 --> 03:25:11.961
technically-- what were the two rolls?

03:25:11.961 --> 03:25:13.511
MARISHA: A 21 and a 16.

03:25:13.511 --> 03:25:14.659
MATT: The first one hits.

03:25:14.659 --> 03:25:19.813
SAM: Yeah Algar, don't mess with the Ruby.

03:25:19.813 --> 03:25:21.249
MARISHA: The first one-- mm-hmm, nine damage.

03:25:21.249 --> 03:25:29.289
MATT: All right. Actually, yeah-- they don't have
a moment to react. Cool, so that ends your turn?

03:25:29.289 --> 03:25:30.356
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:25:30.356 --> 03:25:36.339
MATT: You throw both. One ricochets off, the other
one (grunt), Algar looks, "What the hell? Get them!"

03:25:36.339 --> 03:25:38.604
MARISHA: I go-- around the corner.

03:25:38.604 --> 03:25:47.227
MATT: That ends Beau's turn. It is now the water
elemental's turn. Vanishes beneath the water.

03:25:47.227 --> 03:25:48.897
SAM: We won!

03:25:48.897 --> 03:25:52.419
LIAM: We won, we won!

03:25:52.419 --> 03:25:54.350
MATT: Emerges right there.

03:25:54.350 --> 03:25:55.507
SAM: Ah!

03:25:55.507 --> 03:25:57.788
LAURA: Over Beau?

03:25:57.788 --> 03:26:06.538
MATT: Yeah, next to Beau. It's going to take two
slam attacks against Beau. That's going to be a

03:26:06.538 --> 03:26:08.376
nine to hit.

03:26:08.376 --> 03:26:09.519
MARISHA: Miss.

03:26:09.519 --> 03:26:12.051
MATT: That's going to be a 17 to hit.

03:26:12.051 --> 03:26:12.896
MARISHA: Miss.

03:26:12.896 --> 03:26:20.464
MATT: Both large, giant slam fist towards hitting
the water, causing these giant splashes, but no

03:26:20.571 --> 03:26:33.259
impact on you. That finishes its turn, that brings
us now to Zsundie's turn. Zsundie is going to go

03:26:33.259 --> 03:26:38.963
ahead and angle over this-- actually, he's going
to angle right where it is. You watch as it brings

03:26:38.963 --> 03:26:45.932
its hand forward and there's this tiny little
spiral of dull, greenish energy that turns into a

03:26:45.932 --> 03:26:57.109
jet of really fast-powered water that shoots out
in a 60-foot line. Yasha, Caduceus, and Caleb, I

03:26:57.109 --> 03:27:00.291
need you all to make dexterity saving throws,
please.

03:27:00.291 --> 03:27:02.353
TRAVIS: Not everybody, just in that line.

03:27:02.353 --> 03:27:03.541
MATT: Just in that line.

03:27:03.541 --> 03:27:08.335
TALIESIN: Nope. Four.

03:27:08.335 --> 03:27:09.779
LIAM: 16.

03:27:09.779 --> 03:27:15.306
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural one, but I do now have
Fanatical Focus.

03:27:15.306 --> 03:27:16.541
MATT: Yes.

03:27:16.541 --> 03:27:21.479
ASHLEY: So if you fail a saving throw-- while
you're raging, and I'm not.

03:27:21.479 --> 03:27:22.830
MATT: You're not raging yet, no.

03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:23.752
ASHLEY: Natural one.

03:27:23.752 --> 03:27:25.503
LAURA and SAM: Oh no!

03:27:25.503 --> 03:27:37.464
MATT: That will be 24 points of bludgeoning
damage. You take half that, so you take 12, but

03:27:37.464 --> 03:27:44.482
that's 24 to Caduceus and 24 to Yasha. You're both
pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone.

03:27:44.482 --> 03:27:47.106
TRAVIS: 20 feet away? Two zero?

03:27:47.106 --> 03:27:48.677
MARISHA: 20 feet?

03:27:48.677 --> 03:27:50.881
MATT: Yes. Caleb gets pushed back to there--

03:27:50.881 --> 03:27:53.187
LIAM: I get pushed even though I saved?

03:27:53.187 --> 03:27:58.795
MATT: Actually, no, you are not pushed, Caleb.

03:27:58.795 --> 03:28:00.919
SAM: That means I'm going to slam into you.

03:28:00.919 --> 03:28:08.470
MATT: Yep, which means they all slam into you. You
actually hold that position-- I'll say for the

03:28:08.470 --> 03:28:12.004
purposes of the narrative here, you do get knocked
prone from their impact.

03:28:12.004 --> 03:28:13.911
LAURA: But it keeps them from going back.

03:28:13.911 --> 03:28:17.022
MATT: Yeah. You all don't get shot out of the
room, but all three of you are knocked prone on

03:28:17.022 --> 03:28:20.595
the ground, Caleb taking the brunt of two of his
larger teammates--

03:28:20.595 --> 03:28:23.149
LIAM: Flipping somersault, up in the air.

03:28:23.149 --> 03:28:26.427
SAM: Those are some big fellas.

03:28:26.427 --> 03:28:32.892
MATT: With that, he's going to shift over into
this direction. That's going to finish his turn.

03:28:32.892 --> 03:28:34.738
Caduceus, you're up.

03:28:34.738 --> 03:28:35.774
SAM and MARISHA: Zsundie.

03:28:35.774 --> 03:28:36.838
MATT: Zsundie.

03:28:36.838 --> 03:28:38.283
MARISHA: Zsundie with a "J"?

03:28:38.283 --> 03:28:41.572
SAM: I'm spelling it "Zh".

03:28:41.572 --> 03:28:42.805
LIAM: Like Zsa Zsa?

03:28:42.805 --> 03:28:46.046
MATT: Zsundie.

03:28:46.046 --> 03:28:55.657
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up and be like, Man,
I've got to get that bracelet off that guy, god. Ugh.

03:28:55.657 --> 03:28:57.636
I'm going to--

03:28:57.636 --> 03:29:01.254
SAM: Where he's from, these are bracelets, and
these are necklaces.

03:29:01.254 --> 03:29:10.447
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and get up and crawl
around into the corner right there, get as far into

03:29:10.447 --> 03:29:13.021
the corner. Am I within 60 feet of Algar?

03:29:13.021 --> 03:29:19.099
MATT: (counting) Unfortunately, that's as far as
you can get is right up against Yasha.

03:29:19.099 --> 03:29:20.884
TALIESIN: Am I 60 feet from Algar?

03:29:20.884 --> 03:29:22.842
MATT: You don't know, you have to eyeball it.

03:29:22.842 --> 03:29:29.033
TALIESIN: Motherfucker. Uh--

03:29:29.033 --> 03:29:31.056
MATT: It's a little dicey.

03:29:31.056 --> 03:29:35.933
TALIESIN: It is a little dicey. That's as far as I
can move?

03:29:35.933 --> 03:29:38.509
MATT: Yeah, because you used half your movement to
get up from prone.

03:29:38.509 --> 03:29:40.202
TALIESIN: Then I have no damn movement.

03:29:40.202 --> 03:29:41.819
MATT: You're moving through the water.

03:29:41.819 --> 03:29:53.271
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to-- let's see. First
thing I'm going to do is-- oh man. I'm so sorry, I

03:29:53.271 --> 03:29:55.709
don't quite have my shit together.

03:29:55.709 --> 03:29:57.417
MATT: Fjord, you're up next, by the way.

03:29:57.417 --> 03:30:01.624
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my Blight Staff.

03:30:01.624 --> 03:30:08.505
I'm going to use my bonus action to cast
the swarm.

03:30:08.505 --> 03:30:10.143
MATT: All right.

03:30:10.143 --> 03:30:13.132
TALIESIN: I'm going to use it to get-- how far
away?

03:30:13.132 --> 03:30:15.421
MATT: The beetles are swimming on the surface.

03:30:15.421 --> 03:30:17.298
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, they fly.

03:30:17.298 --> 03:30:18.845
MATT: Oh yeah.

03:30:18.845 --> 03:30:22.580
TALIESIN: I figure, they're (flying noise) so.
Flying beetles.

03:30:22.580 --> 03:30:23.648
MATT: They're coasting over.

03:30:23.648 --> 03:30:29.980
TALIESIN: They're going to go irritate the other
side of the water monster at the moment.

03:30:29.980 --> 03:30:31.134
MATT: So right there?

03:30:31.134 --> 03:30:33.075
TALIESIN: No, the water--

03:30:33.075 --> 03:30:35.950
MATT: Okay, over there, it's harrying it, so--

03:30:35.950 --> 03:30:39.267
TALIESIN: Then for my attack-- hmm?

03:30:39.267 --> 03:30:40.662
MATT: You can roll their attack if you want to.

03:30:40.662 --> 03:30:44.485
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. That's uh-- sorry. That's a
weird little-- I actually don't have their attack

03:30:44.485 --> 03:30:45.564
information still.

03:30:45.564 --> 03:30:47.784
MATT: Oh. It's a--

03:30:47.784 --> 03:30:53.944
TALIESIN: Plus what? It's a bite attack. I know I
don't-- we haven't fixed it yet.

03:30:54.036 --> 03:30:58.115
MATT: It's okay. We'll get that fixed in the app.
It's plus three to hit, so go ahead and roll an

03:30:58.115 --> 03:30:59.698
attack to hit.

03:30:59.698 --> 03:31:01.377
TALIESIN: No, that's an eight.

03:31:01.377 --> 03:31:04.795
MATT: That does not hit unfortunately. But you now
have a swarm of beetles now here in this dark

03:31:04.795 --> 03:31:06.105
underground area--

03:31:06.105 --> 03:31:17.001
TALIESIN: For my actual action I'm going to put--
I'm going to use one of my Channel Divinities.

03:31:17.001 --> 03:31:18.503
MATT: Okay.

03:31:18.503 --> 03:31:29.913
TALIESIN: On the water creature just to-- just for
now I'm going to cast the-- Path to the Grave.

03:31:29.913 --> 03:31:31.468
MATT: Okay.

03:31:31.468 --> 03:31:34.747
TALIESIN: And then that's my turn.

03:31:34.747 --> 03:31:38.101
MATT: That finishes your go. Fjord, you're up.

03:31:38.101 --> 03:31:40.273
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to try some shit.

03:31:40.273 --> 03:31:42.303
TALIESIN: The next person who hits that water thing is
going to hurt.

03:31:42.303 --> 03:31:49.009
TRAVIS: Can I use my 30 feet to run by this
creature to this area?

03:31:49.009 --> 03:31:58.539
MATT: Sure. Yeah. Because you don't have to worry
about that. So you can go (counting) 30 is as far

03:31:58.539 --> 03:31:59.651
as you can get.

03:31:59.651 --> 03:32:00.420
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:32:00.420 --> 03:32:01.544
MATT: It will get an attack of opportunity on you
as you move.

03:32:01.544 --> 03:32:02.546
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

03:32:02.546 --> 03:32:05.997
MATT: So as you rush by-- (whoof)-- reaches out
with a heavy--

03:32:05.997 --> 03:32:07.664
MARISHA: Sentinel attack

03:32:07.664 --> 03:32:09.185
MATT: That's a natural 20.

03:32:09.185 --> 03:32:10.130
ALL: Oof.

03:32:10.130 --> 03:32:11.697
TALIESIN: I'm going to undo that.

03:32:11.697 --> 03:32:13.550
MATT: Oh, because you have a reaction that can do
that! That's right!

03:32:13.550 --> 03:32:14.699
TALIESIN: None of that shit.

03:32:14.699 --> 03:32:18.362
MARISHA: Can I Sentinel that bitch since I'm next
to it? And it's attacking someone who's not me?

03:32:18.362 --> 03:32:19.523
MATT: You can.

03:32:19.523 --> 03:32:21.047
LIAM: Yeah! What's that power, Tal?

03:32:21.047 --> 03:32:22.534
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find it again--

03:32:22.534 --> 03:32:30.712
MATT: It's an ability of the Grave cleric. So
that's just a regular attack there. So that's

03:32:30.712 --> 03:32:40.348
going to be-- Zsundi, Zsundi, 13 points of
bludgeoning damage to you, Fjord, on the back of

03:32:40.348 --> 03:32:42.908
your shoulder as you lunge forward but you make it
to your space.

03:32:42.908 --> 03:32:44.347
TRAVIS: Did you roll to hit?

03:32:44.347 --> 03:32:49.830
MATT: It still hits as a natural 20, but it's just
not a critical hit.

03:32:49.830 --> 03:32:51.256
TALIESIN: I can cancel that.

03:32:51.256 --> 03:32:52.568
TRAVIS: 13 points, got it.

03:32:52.568 --> 03:32:56.413
MATT: That would have been a little harsher. So
what are you doing?

03:32:56.413 --> 03:32:57.591
TRAVIS: Okay, so.

03:32:57.591 --> 03:32:59.067
MATT: You're up next, Yasha.

03:32:59.067 --> 03:33:01.530
TRAVIS: Would you say that's about 30 feet
to here?

03:33:01.543 --> 03:33:04.908
MATT: It looks like it's pretty close, you'd have
to give it a shot.

03:33:04.908 --> 03:33:08.819
TRAVIS: All right. Grasping the falchion, I'm
going to use my bonus action to cast Misty Step

03:33:08.819 --> 03:33:10.267
and try to (fwoomp).

03:33:10.267 --> 03:33:17.704
MATT: Oh, it's a bonus action. Yeah. (counting)
30. With the height that gets you right there.

03:33:17.704 --> 03:33:23.928
SAM: Oh no, Fjord. Ten bucks you get
defenestrated.

03:33:23.928 --> 03:33:25.685
MARISHA: I rolled a 14 to attack the water
elemental.

03:33:25.685 --> 03:33:27.285
MATT: That just hits.

03:33:27.285 --> 03:33:31.519
MARISHA: Not great... six damage.

03:33:31.519 --> 03:33:35.120
TALIESIN: And technically it's also divinity.

03:33:35.120 --> 03:33:36.133
MATT: That was with your staff or with your fist?

03:33:36.133 --> 03:33:36.930
MARISHA: Staff.

03:33:36.930 --> 03:33:38.760
MATT: All right. It's also halved.

03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:40.397
MARISHA: Shit, I should have just punched it.

03:33:40.397 --> 03:33:46.031
MATT: Well, now you know. You're reminded--oh. It
seems to resist non-magical impacts.

03:33:46.031 --> 03:33:47.915
TALIESIN: Did the divinity get pulled then from
that?

03:33:47.915 --> 03:33:53.430
MATT: No, so yeah, that would have been an attack.
It takes six damage, and the vulnerability goes

03:33:53.430 --> 03:33:56.372
away. So, it does full damage.

03:33:56.372 --> 03:33:57.951
MARISHA: Did I just waste something?

03:33:57.951 --> 03:34:00.276
TALIESIN: Kind of? Something that nobody
understands yet that I should probably explain to

03:34:00.276 --> 03:34:01.713
people at some point.

03:34:01.713 --> 03:34:03.972
MATT: Yeah, but tactically you'll figure it out in
the future.

03:34:03.972 --> 03:34:06.363
TALIESIN: Oh god. Now I'm thinking--

03:34:06.363 --> 03:34:10.254
MATT: That's okay. Now you know. That brings us to
Fjord's turn.

03:34:10.254 --> 03:34:15.077
TRAVIS: I appear on the platform. I look around
and say, hey kids, you just fucking couldn't

03:34:15.212 --> 03:34:19.330
"leave well enough alone. And I'll take the
falchion and I'll shove it in the ground and cast

03:34:19.407 --> 03:34:20.495
Thunder Step!

03:34:20.495 --> 03:34:21.325
SAM: Ooh!

03:34:21.325 --> 03:34:22.365
LAURA: Yeah!

03:34:22.365 --> 03:34:23.930
SAM: Thunder Step? What's Thunder Step?

03:34:23.930 --> 03:34:28.856
TRAVIS: They take 3d10 damage and this cacophonous
thunderous boom.

03:34:28.856 --> 03:34:30.484
SAM: It's not Thunder Wave?

03:34:30.484 --> 03:34:33.562
TRAVIS: No, Thunder Step. And I jump 90 feet in
any direction.

03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:34.822
SAM: Whoa!

03:34:34.822 --> 03:34:36.025
MARISHA: What?

03:34:36.025 --> 03:34:37.148
ASHLEY: Whoa.

03:34:37.148 --> 03:34:43.411
MATT: All righty. Yeah, that'll do it. All right.
So.

03:34:43.411 --> 03:34:45.296
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:34:45.296 --> 03:34:48.886
MATT: Technically you didn't even have to use your
bonus action to Misty Step there.

03:34:48.886 --> 03:34:49.851
TRAVIS: I didn't?

03:34:49.851 --> 03:34:54.264
MATT: No, when you-- using the action you teleport
yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within

03:34:54.264 --> 03:34:57.970
range and immediately after you disappear--
actually no, the boom happens when you teleport.

03:34:57.970 --> 03:34:59.706
No, you're right. You did it right.

03:34:59.706 --> 03:35:01.003
TRAVIS: Oh, phew.

03:35:01.003 --> 03:35:02.115
MATT: So, where do you want to land?

03:35:02.115 --> 03:35:04.486
TRAVIS: I want to land on this platform over
here.

03:35:04.486 --> 03:35:06.468
MARISHA: That's so cool!

03:35:06.468 --> 03:35:12.699
MATT: You watch as Fjord teleports, speaks for a
second, and then where he vanishes, there's this

03:35:12.699 --> 03:35:22.254
blast of thunderous energy. The moisture in the
air is evaporated from the impact, causing this

03:35:22.254 --> 03:35:27.084
faint misty orb-like power-- like that! Thank you,
Taliesin!

03:35:27.084 --> 03:35:28.657
TALIESIN: I had to.

03:35:28.657 --> 03:35:33.060
MATT: Constitution saving throw to each of them,
so go ahead and roll damage on that one.

03:35:33.060 --> 03:35:35.704
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a constitution 15, is the
save.

03:35:35.704 --> 03:35:44.423
MATT: Got you. That's cocked. That's a failure on
one of the guards. So total 15 you said?

03:35:44.423 --> 03:35:46.985
TRAVIS: 15 for the save, and 19 points of damage.

03:35:46.985 --> 03:35:49.975
MATT: 19 points of damage. Failure on both
guards.

03:35:49.975 --> 03:35:51.945
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:35:51.945 --> 03:35:53.612
TRAVIS: I did something!

03:35:53.612 --> 03:35:55.862
MARISHA: You did it! It was so good!

03:35:55.862 --> 03:36:00.004
MATT: Algar does succeed though, he rolled a 16.
He takes half damage?

03:36:00.004 --> 03:36:00.965
TRAVIS: He does.

03:36:00.965 --> 03:36:03.980
ASHLEY: That was awesome.

03:36:03.980 --> 03:36:05.114
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:36:05.114 --> 03:36:06.799
MARISHA: That totally was, that was great!

03:36:06.799 --> 03:36:11.432
MATT: They are pushed-- oh no, they just take
damage.

03:36:11.432 --> 03:36:12.945
TRAVIS: Yeah, they just take damage.

03:36:12.945 --> 03:36:18.834
MATT: Impact hits, they almost slide off the side
and catch the railing and barely pull themselves

03:36:18.834 --> 03:36:22.646
back into the space. All right then, is that your
turn?

03:36:22.646 --> 03:36:23.782
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it.

03:36:23.782 --> 03:36:24.793
MATT: That was nice.

03:36:24.793 --> 03:36:26.076
TRAVIS: Oh, thanks.

03:36:26.076 --> 03:36:27.854
MATT: Finishing Fjord's turn, Yasha, you're up.

03:36:27.854 --> 03:36:31.876
ASHLEY: Okay, I would like to rage.

03:36:31.876 --> 03:36:34.129
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yes!

03:36:34.129 --> 03:36:37.378
ASHLEY: I'm prone, right?

03:36:37.378 --> 03:36:42.012
MATT: You are prone, yes, so you use half your
movement to stand up.

03:36:42.012 --> 03:36:46.077
ASHLEY: The other half of the movement then, could
I get to the other side of the water elemental then?

03:36:46.077 --> 03:36:49.200
MATT: What's your movement? 40, right?

03:36:49.200 --> 03:36:50.310
ASHLEY: 40?

03:36:50.310 --> 03:36:55.494
MATT: (counting) Yeah, you can get there because
of your barbarian speed.

03:36:55.494 --> 03:36:56.950
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to take an attack.

03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:58.654
MATT: Go for it.

03:36:58.654 --> 03:37:07.040
ASHLEY: 17.

03:37:07.040 --> 03:37:09.579
MATT: 17 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

03:37:09.579 --> 03:37:11.241
LIAM: Grog is gone.

03:37:11.241 --> 03:37:13.614
TRAVIS: I'm so happy!

03:37:13.614 --> 03:37:21.539
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

03:37:21.627 --> 03:37:23.245
LAURA: Ugh.

03:37:23.335 --> 03:37:27.659
ASHLEY: (counting) 13.

03:37:27.659 --> 03:37:34.774
MATT: All righty. That was the first attack. You
do that with your--? You have an extra attack; you

03:37:34.774 --> 03:37:35.689
can do two strikes.

03:37:35.689 --> 03:37:36.809
ASHLEY: Oh, I forgot about that. Jesus, sorry.

03:37:36.809 --> 03:37:38.041
MATT: It's okay.

03:37:38.041 --> 03:37:43.039
ASHLEY: Oh, that does not hit. No, that does not
hit. Seven.

03:37:43.039 --> 03:37:48.772
MATT: Seven does not hit, no. You swing twice.
First strike hits, second one swings wide as it

03:37:48.772 --> 03:37:52.877
dodges out of the way. It seems like when the
first hit its head area, where its head would be

03:37:52.877 --> 03:37:56.436
splits in two, one's still focused on Beau and the
other one curves around to look at you for a

03:37:56.436 --> 03:38:01.775
second. You see this dull glow where its sentient
eyes would be and is now focused on each of you.

03:38:01.775 --> 03:38:03.316
Does that end your turn, Yasha?

03:38:03.316 --> 03:38:05.925
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:38:05.925 --> 03:38:13.580
MATT: All right. That brings us to Algar. Algar,
having this happen, goes, "Shit! Protect me!"

03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:15.946
Pulls out a potion and drinks it real fast.

03:38:15.946 --> 03:38:19.920
SAM: Oh no. Douche.

03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:21.359
MATT: Heals up a bit.

03:38:21.359 --> 03:38:22.643
LAURA: He <i>heals.</i>

03:38:22.643 --> 03:38:23.653
TRAVIS: Did he take any damage?

03:38:23.653 --> 03:38:25.037
LAURA: Yeah, he took damage from you.

03:38:25.037 --> 03:38:26.474
TRAVIS: No he didn't-- oh, he took half damage.

03:38:26.474 --> 03:38:28.695
MARISHA: I threw a shuriken.

03:38:28.695 --> 03:38:31.692
MATT: She threw a shuriken at him. He's going to
move up into this chamber a bit here.

03:38:31.692 --> 03:38:33.452
SAM: Oh no, he's escaping.

03:38:33.452 --> 03:38:35.164
MARISHA: Little dick.

03:38:35.164 --> 03:38:41.238
MATT: That's going to end his turn. He doesn't
want to get too far away from his bodyguards. That

03:38:41.238 --> 03:38:43.329
brings us to Caleb.

03:38:43.329 --> 03:38:50.388
LIAM: Okay, so Caleb springs up out of the water,
and I think from where I am, I have a direct line

03:38:50.388 --> 03:38:54.068
of sight to that corner that he just went around,
yeah? Because they've got light up there.

03:38:54.068 --> 03:38:55.367
MATT: There you do, yes.

03:38:55.367 --> 03:38:59.741
LIAM: Yeah. I am pulling out the bat shit and the
sulfur and I am going to slap them together and

03:38:59.741 --> 03:39:08.401
throw a fucking Fireball and yell: <i>Fick ihr
alle!</i> A Fireball is going to shoot across the

03:39:08.401 --> 03:39:18.320
room into that square just to the left
of him, my left, which means it should get all three.

03:39:18.320 --> 03:39:19.883
TRAVIS: Arcane hype!

03:39:19.883 --> 03:39:26.405
ALL: Ooh!

03:39:26.405 --> 03:39:28.310
TALIESIN: That's nasty.

03:39:28.310 --> 03:39:30.320
MATT: Go ahead and roll some damage. What's your
spell DC?

03:39:30.320 --> 03:39:33.980
LIAM: It is a 16.

03:39:33.980 --> 03:39:35.549
MATT: 16, okay.

03:39:35.549 --> 03:39:37.652
MARISHA: Big money.

03:39:37.652 --> 03:39:38.950
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:39:38.950 --> 03:39:43.706
LIAM: (counting)

03:39:43.706 --> 03:39:45.108
MARISHA: Where'd you get the rainbow dice?

03:39:45.108 --> 03:39:46.094
MATT: Failure on the first one.

03:39:46.094 --> 03:39:47.529
LIAM: 34 fire damage.

03:39:47.529 --> 03:39:48.696
MARISHA: Ooh.

03:39:48.696 --> 03:39:52.302
MATT: Failure on the first bodyguard. Success on
the second one.

03:39:52.302 --> 03:39:56.199
TRAVIS: A Hans and Franz.

03:39:56.199 --> 03:39:58.357
MARISHA: Hans and Franz.

03:39:58.357 --> 03:40:01.226
MATT: Okay, Algar does succeed. Thank god.

03:40:01.226 --> 03:40:03.143
MARISHA: What? No!

03:40:03.212 --> 03:40:06.782
LAURA: You! You were using my dice?

03:40:06.885 --> 03:40:09.276
TRAVIS: Algar succeeded, you guys. That's twice.

03:40:09.384 --> 03:40:16.304
MATT: However, this blast of fire rocks the
interior of the chamber. You watch as both of the

03:40:16.304 --> 03:40:23.893
bodyguards (grunting and panting) look up at
themselves. You can see their skin is burned,

03:40:23.893 --> 03:40:29.398
in areas it's cracked a little bit, and they look
over towards Algar, look out towards you, and you

03:40:29.398 --> 03:40:31.245
see him defensively moving back towards his
position.

03:40:31.245 --> 03:40:38.865
LIAM: I will walk 15 feet backward into the tunnel
I'm in. (Bane voice) I will walk 15 feet

03:40:38.865 --> 03:40:40.176
backward.

03:40:40.176 --> 03:40:43.724
MATT: All right, that ends Caleb's go. Jester,
you're up.

03:40:43.724 --> 03:40:51.597
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to walk forward as far as I
can, like here? Can I get here?

03:40:51.597 --> 03:40:58.083
MATT: From there? (counting) Yes, you can.

03:40:58.083 --> 03:41:01.389
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Invoke Duplicity 30 feet
in front of me.

03:41:01.389 --> 03:41:03.203
MATT: All righty, where do you want it to go?

03:41:03.203 --> 03:41:06.085
LAURA: Well, I'm sure right around there.

03:41:06.085 --> 03:41:07.183
MATT: Here?

03:41:07.183 --> 03:41:17.016
LAURA: Yeah. Then my duplicate is going to cast
Spiritual Weapon at what's his fuck? At Algar.

03:41:17.016 --> 03:41:19.011
SAM: You can't see Algar.

03:41:19.011 --> 03:41:20.602
LAURA: Yeah, but I can see where he went.

03:41:20.602 --> 03:41:24.631
MATT: (counting)

03:41:24.631 --> 03:41:25.942
LAURA: It's 120--

03:41:25.942 --> 03:41:27.075
MARISHA: Block the door.

03:41:27.075 --> 03:41:28.169
MATT: Yeah, then you can do that there.

03:41:28.169 --> 03:41:29.025
LAURA: Yeah!

03:41:29.025 --> 03:41:30.127
LIAM: Oh, surprise motherfucker.

03:41:30.127 --> 03:41:32.643
MARISHA: Large fries, motherfucker.

03:41:32.643 --> 03:41:35.424
MATT: Heart eyes, motherfucker.

03:41:35.424 --> 03:41:40.187
LAURA: Still the lollipop, but razor blade edges.

03:41:40.187 --> 03:41:41.994
MATT: Ooh, a jagged lollipop.

03:41:41.994 --> 03:41:43.120
ALL: Oh.

03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:46.805
LAURA: I'm going to try to hit his arm and chop
off his arm.

03:41:46.805 --> 03:41:48.337
MATT: Go for it.

03:41:48.337 --> 03:41:49.344
SAM: Oh god.

03:41:49.344 --> 03:41:51.480
MARISHA: Rue dies, motherfucker.

03:41:51.480 --> 03:41:53.895
MATT: Large fries, motherfucker.

03:41:53.895 --> 03:41:56.250
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:41:56.250 --> 03:41:58.188
(cheering)

03:41:58.188 --> 03:42:01.016
MATT: Go ahead and roll some damage on that one.

03:42:01.016 --> 03:42:04.151
TALIESIN and LIAM: (chainsaw noises)

03:42:04.151 --> 03:42:06.078
LAURA: Did that work? Did I chop off his arm
because that's what I was trying to do!

03:42:06.078 --> 03:42:11.303
MATT: You don't actually see him, so you're hoping
it hits across the wall.

03:42:11.303 --> 03:42:14.239
LAURA: I'm hoping it hits him! Ten damage.

03:42:14.239 --> 03:42:20.394
MATT: Technically, I should have given you
disadvantage because you can't see the target, but

03:42:20.394 --> 03:42:27.459
it's fine, I'll let it go through. There you go.
You hear (groan) across the wall. You have no idea

03:42:27.459 --> 03:42:31.084
to what effect it was, but you hit something.
Probably Algar.

03:42:31.084 --> 03:42:33.785
LAURA: My duplicate goes, "Ha ha," too.

03:42:33.785 --> 03:42:35.526
LIAM: Are you a fan of Matisse?

03:42:35.526 --> 03:42:37.110
MARISHA: Right in the kidney.

03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:38.205
MATT: End your turn?

03:42:38.205 --> 03:42:39.110
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

03:42:39.110 --> 03:42:41.502
MATT: All right, top of the round. Nott, you're
up. Actually, no, the dwarves have to go still.

03:42:41.502 --> 03:42:49.113
The bodyguards rush over, getting into the space
that that's there, pushing past to the-- heads

03:42:49.113 --> 03:42:55.884
this way. This one is going to move back and you
don't know what this one does because he's moved

03:42:55.884 --> 03:43:00.757
from your visual range, but this one, as it pulls
back, it has a large heavy crossbow, and it's

03:43:00.757 --> 03:43:12.491
going to go ahead and take a shot at you, Jester,
from back here. Actually, let's see. No, he's

03:43:12.491 --> 03:43:15.589
going to shoot at Caduceus because Caduceus is
already wounded and wants to try and take down

03:43:15.589 --> 03:43:25.110
those who are already hit. That's going to be,
against Caduceus-- it's going to be a 21 to hit?

03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:26.505
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

03:43:26.505 --> 03:43:32.966
MATT: All right. You take nine points of piercing
damage.

03:43:32.966 --> 03:43:34.358
TALIESIN: Ow!

03:43:34.358 --> 03:43:41.927
MATT: That's all the damage you take, and then it
moves back and hides in this space here. That's

03:43:41.927 --> 03:43:48.487
going to go ahead and end that go. Now, it is top
of the round. Nott, you're up.

03:43:48.487 --> 03:43:54.881
SAM: How can I control the Mage Hand with a bonus
action? Can I move it and grab with it, or just

03:43:54.881 --> 03:43:56.711
grab with it? It's very vague.

03:43:56.711 --> 03:43:58.701
MATT: Let's have a look here.

03:43:58.701 --> 03:44:01.080
TRAVIS: Read it, Sam, what's it say on D&D
Beyond?

03:44:01.080 --> 03:44:03.071
LAURA: (singing) On D&D!

03:44:03.071 --> 03:44:06.657
SAM: It says, "You can control the hand." But I
don't know if that means--

03:44:06.657 --> 03:44:09.194
MATT: The hand can move 30 feet each time you use
it, so it can move and do something.

03:44:09.194 --> 03:44:14.930
SAM: Okay. So who has the necklace? Zsa Zsa?
Zsundie?

03:44:14.930 --> 03:44:19.238
LAURA: Has a necklace on, but Algar has a bracelet
on that's controlling it.

03:44:19.324 --> 03:44:21.836
SAM: I can't see Algar, but Zsundie is the--

03:44:21.836 --> 03:44:23.059
MATT: It's right there, yeah.

03:44:23.059 --> 03:44:27.251
SAM: He's wearing a necklace? I will bonus action
try to steal his necklace.

03:44:27.251 --> 03:44:32.032
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll an arcana
check.

03:44:32.032 --> 03:44:33.434
SAM: Arcana check?

03:44:33.434 --> 03:44:34.885
MATT: Yep.

03:44:34.885 --> 03:44:41.043
SAM: 19. I don't get sleight of hand or anything?

03:44:41.043 --> 03:44:47.044
MATT: It's less of a necklace and more of a large
metallic band that is around the neck like a

03:44:47.044 --> 03:44:48.062
collar.

03:44:48.062 --> 03:44:49.184
LAURA: It's a collar.

03:44:49.184 --> 03:44:51.989
TRAVIS: He ain't stepping out in high fashion.

03:44:51.989 --> 03:44:53.200
SAM: 19.

03:44:53.200 --> 03:44:57.463
MATT: The hand reaches and grasps towards it and
pulls, but it's locked in place. There's no trick

03:44:57.463 --> 03:45:01.123
to removing it that the hand seems to be able to
deal with, but it's a good thought.

03:45:01.123 --> 03:45:03.139
SAM: I give him a purple nurple.

03:45:03.139 --> 03:45:05.966
(laughter)

03:45:05.966 --> 03:45:18.550
SAM: And then I'll back up a couple feet and fire
at the big water blob. Does it get an attack or no?

03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:22.385
MATT: It does not have reach with its slam, so
no.

03:45:22.385 --> 03:45:24.209
SAM: Okay, I'll fire.

03:45:24.209 --> 03:45:26.409
MATT: All right, go for it.

03:45:26.409 --> 03:45:28.932
SAM: That is a 17, I believe.

03:45:28.932 --> 03:45:30.962
MATT: 17 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

03:45:30.962 --> 03:45:40.999
SAM: 17, plus I'll use Fury of the Small to add
another six, that's 23!

03:45:40.999 --> 03:45:50.810
MATT: Nice! 23 points of damage, well done. All
right, that finishes your turn. That brings us to Beau.

03:45:50.810 --> 03:45:58.688
MARISHA: I am going to steel myself for a minute,
look at the water elemental to my right, and then

03:45:58.688 --> 03:46:09.934
cast Step of the Wind with a ki point and try and
disengage like a rogue.

03:46:09.934 --> 03:46:12.440
SAM: (singing) Like a rogue!

03:46:12.440 --> 03:46:14.447
MATT: Step of the Wind lets you move as a bonus
action, right?

03:46:14.447 --> 03:46:26.863
MARISHA: It does, but it says you can spend one ki
point to take the disengage or dash action as a

03:46:26.863 --> 03:46:27.938
bonus action.

03:46:27.938 --> 03:46:29.708
MATT: Oh, that's what it means, gotcha. So yeah
you can disengage. You use a ki point, your bonus

03:46:29.708 --> 03:46:30.834
action to disengage.

03:46:30.834 --> 03:46:34.966
MARISHA: So I would have to take an attack of
opportunity if I decided to dash instead of

03:46:34.966 --> 03:46:36.091
disengage, right?

03:46:36.091 --> 03:46:37.265
MATT: Correct. Up to you.

03:46:37.265 --> 03:46:42.845
SAM: Have any of you heard of Marius LePual?

03:46:42.845 --> 03:46:45.486
(laughter)

03:46:45.486 --> 03:46:46.523
MATT: What're you doing, Beau?

03:46:46.523 --> 03:46:48.203
MARISHA: I'm going to risk the hit and take the dash.

03:46:48.203 --> 03:46:56.778
MATT: All right. So it's going to swing towards
you. That is going to be an 18 to hit.

03:46:56.778 --> 03:46:57.980
MARISHA: Miss!

03:46:57.980 --> 03:47:00.219
MATT: Whoosh, just past you.

03:47:00.219 --> 03:47:12.612
MARISHA: So my jump distance is also doubled for
the turn. Can I be like, parkour, parkour, and

03:47:12.612 --> 03:47:14.459
jump. I'm going to try and jump up here.

03:47:14.459 --> 03:47:21.915
MATT: Okay, it's still your movement. So if you're
wanting to leap off and parkour? All right, so

03:47:21.915 --> 03:47:27.359
we'll say that's about 20 feet to get there. Go
ahead and make an acrobatics check.

03:47:27.359 --> 03:47:32.413
MARISHA: Is this disadvantage again or no? I'm not
rolling Gil.

03:47:32.413 --> 03:47:34.492
MATT: This is still disadvantage because it's
slick.

03:47:34.492 --> 03:47:39.669
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

03:47:39.669 --> 03:47:41.634
MATT: Natural one. So--

03:47:41.634 --> 03:47:44.143
SAM: Don't you have a feat now? Fanatical
fanatic?

03:47:44.143 --> 03:47:46.290
TRAVIS: (quietly) That's Yasha.

03:47:46.290 --> 03:47:55.632
MATT: So you land, and slip right into the ground,
the water splashes, you're underwater for a

03:47:55.632 --> 03:48:01.669
second. You use the rest of your Step of the Wind
extra dash movement to get up from prone. That's

03:48:01.669 --> 03:48:06.261
your bonus action.You still have your action and
movement.

03:48:06.261 --> 03:48:09.797
MARISHA: I move the rest of the way.

03:48:09.797 --> 03:48:14.621
MATT: All right. (counting)

03:48:14.621 --> 03:48:21.433
MARISHA: I can't jump now? I can't use that double
jump distance? Is that done, Step of the Wind?

03:48:21.433 --> 03:48:28.555
MATT: I'll say if you wanted to try and vertical
leap from here, go ahead and make an athletics

03:48:28.555 --> 03:48:32.395
check to see if, given the circumstances of the
turn, you can make it.

03:48:32.395 --> 03:48:34.014
MARISHA: Okay, 22.

03:48:34.014 --> 03:48:39.678
MATT: 22? I'll allow you to just get the final
distance on the edge and have to correct yourself

03:48:39.678 --> 03:48:42.971
and then catch it on the ledge. But that's the end
of your movement there.

03:48:42.971 --> 03:48:50.413
MARISHA: (panting) Fuck, you guys. And I'm
going to take my shurikens and pop pop!

03:48:50.413 --> 03:48:51.827
MATT: Towards?

03:48:51.827 --> 03:48:53.465
MARISHA: Whoever I can see.

03:48:53.465 --> 03:48:59.631
MATT: You can barely see Algar just around the
corner. Three-quarters cover. And then there's the

03:48:59.631 --> 03:49:00.941
protector who looks fairly hurt.

03:49:00.941 --> 03:49:02.523
LAURA: Did I chop off his hand? Can you tell?

03:49:02.523 --> 03:49:04.016
MARISHA: Who, the dwarf?

03:49:04.016 --> 03:49:07.423
MATT: I mean they all look pretty hurt, the
Fireball wrecked their world a little bit.

03:49:07.423 --> 03:49:10.137
MARISHA: Does it look like Jester chopped off
Algar's hand?

03:49:10.137 --> 03:49:11.121
MATT: No.

03:49:11.121 --> 03:49:12.208
MARISHA: (shouting) No!

03:49:12.208 --> 03:49:13.090
LAURA: Damn it!

03:49:13.090 --> 03:49:22.276
MARISHA: Sorry! I'll go one for the dwarf, one for
Algar. Pretty color for the dwarf. Balls, so many

03:49:22.276 --> 03:49:29.254
balls all the way around. We have nine for the
dwarf, and we have 12 for Algar.

03:49:29.254 --> 03:49:34.065
MATT: No, unfortunately none of those hit. So they
ricochet off the stone walls. And your foot is

03:49:34.065 --> 03:49:37.166
still slick from having to balance on the edge and
when you throw them both you have to compensate

03:49:37.166 --> 03:49:40.149
and they both go wide. But good try.

03:49:40.149 --> 03:49:41.375
TRAVIS: Good try!

03:49:41.375 --> 03:49:42.326
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:49:42.326 --> 03:49:44.349
SAM: No, not a good try, you failed.

03:49:44.349 --> 03:49:46.826
MARISHA: I don't have any more bonus actions,
right, or anything?

03:49:46.826 --> 03:49:51.651
MATT: No, that's it. That's your action, bonus
action, and your movement. So, the elemental is

03:49:51.651 --> 03:49:58.057
going to whelm into Caduceus and Yasha's spaces.

03:49:58.057 --> 03:49:59.317
SAM: Oh no!

03:49:59.317 --> 03:50:01.461
MATT: And it's going to make--

03:50:01.532 --> 03:50:03.057
TALIESIN: I'm very low, we'll see how this goes.

03:50:03.057 --> 03:50:06.308
MATT: It's going to make a whelm ability. So each
creature in its space, I need you both to make

03:50:06.308 --> 03:50:08.340
strength saving throws. You have advantage because
you're raging.

03:50:08.340 --> 03:50:11.806
SAM: Come on, Caduce.

03:50:11.806 --> 03:50:16.139
TALIESIN: Nine.

03:50:16.139 --> 03:50:17.672
MATT: That's a failure.

03:50:17.672 --> 03:50:18.898
ASHLEY: 18.

03:50:18.898 --> 03:50:28.113
MATT: 18? That's a success. So, you are grappled.
Until it ends, you are considered restrained, you

03:50:28.113 --> 03:50:37.447
are unable to breathe, and yeah, that's it,
currently. So you're restrained, grappled, unable

03:50:37.447 --> 03:50:39.046
to breathe.

03:50:39.046 --> 03:50:43.117
SAM: That seems nice. It's like a Snuggie.

03:50:43.117 --> 03:50:48.347
MATT: You are pushed out of its space, Yasha, so
you are shoved out at a corner there. You manage

03:50:48.347 --> 03:50:53.710
to free yourself, but Caduceus you now see is
swimming in this creature as it's spinning around,

03:50:53.710 --> 03:51:05.291
it's swirling like a giant water spout in the
center of the chamber. And this guy here is going

03:51:05.291 --> 03:51:12.570
to go ahead and move out into this space, and
knowing what it summons it's going to go ahead and

03:51:12.570 --> 03:51:17.316
pull another water jet. This one is going to go
ahead and shoot through what it thinks is you,

03:51:17.316 --> 03:51:21.007
passes through nothing, but it's going to go for
Caduceus and Caleb as well.

03:51:21.007 --> 03:51:24.260
CALEB: What's the distance?

03:51:24.260 --> 03:51:34.032
MATT: So this guy will move right up there.
(counting) Yeah, it hits you. So I need you both

03:51:34.032 --> 03:51:39.492
to make dexterity saving throws. The water
elemental has to as well. And fails.

03:51:39.492 --> 03:51:41.967
TALIESIN: Dexterity saving throw?

03:51:41.967 --> 03:51:44.814
LAURA: Yes.

03:51:44.814 --> 03:51:48.305
TALIESIN: Come on. Nope.

03:51:48.305 --> 03:51:50.944
LAURA: Put that one away for a while.

03:51:50.944 --> 03:51:52.283
TALIESIN: Yup, I'm putting it away. I'm out.

03:51:52.283 --> 03:51:56.169
LAURA: You don't know, you don't know. You don't
know.

03:51:56.169 --> 03:51:58.475
SAM: What do you mean, you don't know? He just did
the math.

03:51:58.475 --> 03:52:00.226
TALIESIN: No, I haven't done the math yet, but I'm
pretty sure.

03:52:00.226 --> 03:52:01.602
MATT: So that's 25 points of damage.

03:52:01.602 --> 03:52:02.724
TALIESIN: I'm out.

03:52:02.724 --> 03:52:07.638
LIAM: Here's a question, nobody called dibs on the
dodecahedron today. Could one of us, since nobody did?

03:52:07.638 --> 03:52:09.831
MATT: You can't retract--

03:52:09.831 --> 03:52:12.508
LIAM: So we just got to say every game, we just
have to make sure that we spit it out. Okay, so I

03:52:12.508 --> 03:52:14.207
fail, I got a seven.

03:52:14.207 --> 03:52:16.293
MATT: All right, so that's 25 points of
bludgeoning damage to you, Caleb.

03:52:16.293 --> 03:52:17.221
LIAM: I'm out.

03:52:17.221 --> 03:52:19.000
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:20.563
TALIESIN: Guess who's going to be healing.

03:52:20.563 --> 03:52:24.186
LAURA: Oh, fuck. Okay.

03:52:24.186 --> 03:52:25.861
SAM: No!

03:52:25.861 --> 03:52:27.476
MARISHA: My worst nightmare!

03:52:27.476 --> 03:52:28.818
SAM: Water!

03:52:28.818 --> 03:52:33.049
LIAM: Oh, I'm not out, because I have Molly's
necklace.

03:52:33.049 --> 03:52:34.558
MARISHA: You have the necklace from Molly!

03:52:34.558 --> 03:52:36.769
TALIESIN: You're out, you're just not doing death
saves.

03:52:36.769 --> 03:52:39.030
MATT: You're unconscious, but you're not making
death saves, you're stabilized.

03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:40.446
LIAM: Although, I'm underwater.

03:52:40.446 --> 03:52:41.697
MATT: Yeah, you are.

03:52:41.697 --> 03:52:43.348
TRAVIS: It's one foot of water, you probably fell
on your back.

03:52:43.348 --> 03:52:44.559
MATT: No, he's face down.

03:52:44.559 --> 03:52:45.635
TRAVIS: God damn it!

03:52:45.635 --> 03:52:49.006
MATT: I mean--

03:52:49.006 --> 03:52:52.169
TALIESIN: It's got to keep stabilizing you, I
think.

03:52:52.169 --> 03:52:55.539
MATT: Well, you can still drown with it on, but
what's your constitution modifier?

03:52:55.539 --> 03:52:58.807
LIAM: Plus two.

03:52:58.807 --> 03:53:03.275
MATT: Yeah, you have like three minutes before you
drown, sitting there. So you're okay for now.

03:53:03.275 --> 03:53:08.657
We'll say, for just the purposes of like, you're
not sucking air in necessarily.

03:53:08.657 --> 03:53:10.820
LIAM: Right, I'm unconscious and holding my
breath.

03:53:10.820 --> 03:53:15.151
MATT: Nah, yeah, you've convinced me out of it.
We'll get to it.

03:53:15.151 --> 03:53:16.763
LIAM: I think that's the way to go.

03:53:16.763 --> 03:53:19.494
MATT: No that's right, we'll go to constitution
saving throws on your turn. All right, so,

03:53:19.494 --> 03:53:20.747
finishing that.

03:53:20.747 --> 03:53:21.810
MARISHA: Did you just talk Matt out of it?

03:53:21.810 --> 03:53:22.692
LIAM: Yeah.

03:53:22.692 --> 03:53:23.652
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool.

03:53:23.652 --> 03:53:27.630
MATT: Noticing that that is an illusion and seeing
you across the wall--

03:53:27.630 --> 03:53:31.739
LAURA: Oh, but can I make her, like, fall?
Probably not, because it's not my turn.

03:53:31.739 --> 03:53:39.270
MATT: No, it's not. So it turns away and goes
underneath here and glances up towards Beau. You

03:53:39.270 --> 03:53:44.188
see as it glides across the water at rapid speed.
It seems to travel very quickly through any sort

03:53:44.188 --> 03:53:51.573
of water surface and can jump quite a bit. That
brings us to Caduceus's turn. At the top of your

03:53:51.573 --> 03:53:55.069
turn, because you are still whelmed, I need you to
make a death saving throw because you immediately

03:53:55.069 --> 03:54:00.615
take damage as you're caught in the spiral of its
whelm. So you would take 2d8 plus four bludgeoning

03:54:00.615 --> 03:54:06.064
damage, but you just instantaneously lose a death
save. And it's the end of your turn, I need you to

03:54:06.064 --> 03:54:07.545
make another death saving throw.

03:54:07.545 --> 03:54:09.385
SAM: Oh my God this is happening again!

03:54:09.385 --> 03:54:10.945
TALIESIN: Yup. 11, I'm good.

03:54:10.945 --> 03:54:12.344
MATT: That's a success.

03:54:12.344 --> 03:54:13.679
MARISHA: 11?!

03:54:13.679 --> 03:54:20.129
LIAM: I also have a question about the Periapt. It
says that whenever you roll-- oh, it's rolling a

03:54:20.129 --> 03:54:23.097
hit die to regain hit points, but it doesn't count
when anyone heals me?

03:54:23.097 --> 03:54:26.126
MATT: No, it's only when you're using hit dice
during a short rest.

03:54:26.126 --> 03:54:28.157
TALIESIN: As long as Laura throws-- yeah, then--

03:54:28.157 --> 03:54:29.525
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

03:54:29.525 --> 03:54:31.180
MARISHA: Can't die twice in a row.

03:54:31.180 --> 03:54:33.927
TRAVIS: Yeah okay, I'm a little shook, it's cool.

03:54:33.927 --> 03:54:35.220
MATT: What are you doing?

03:54:35.220 --> 03:54:42.501
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my speed to just peek in
the doorway. Just to get a visual on the hallway.

03:54:42.501 --> 03:54:44.050
I don't actually need to see them.

03:54:44.050 --> 03:54:46.337
MATT: Okay, so you can see the hallway behind here
that continues back.

03:54:46.337 --> 03:54:57.014
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my last of two spell
slots to cast Hunger of Hadar 20 feet into the

03:54:57.014 --> 03:55:00.439
hallway with just the brim-- just so it gets the--
yeah.

03:55:00.439 --> 03:55:04.481
MATT: All right, so for that we'll say, I finally
get to use these.

03:55:04.481 --> 03:55:11.123
TRAVIS: So I pop in the doorway, and I reach up
and grab a little bit of reality, and I tear a

03:55:11.123 --> 03:55:14.056
black hole in the hallway.

03:55:14.056 --> 03:55:16.298
MARISHA: Yes! Looney Tunes style!

03:55:16.298 --> 03:55:17.271
TRAVIS: Yup.

03:55:17.271 --> 03:55:18.321
SAM: Wait, what?

03:55:18.321 --> 03:55:20.108
LAURA: He's bringing out the hentai.

03:55:20.108 --> 03:55:22.392
LIAM: Cthulhu's dick.

03:55:22.392 --> 03:55:24.368
TRAVIS: You ain't going nowhere, motherfucker!

03:55:24.368 --> 03:55:26.850
SAM: You ever done this before?

03:55:26.850 --> 03:55:28.295
MATT: He's used the ability before, yeah.

03:55:28.295 --> 03:55:33.628
LAURA: But it was in darkness, right? So none of
us actually saw it.

03:55:33.628 --> 03:55:39.122
TRAVIS: Everything in it is black. So they're
blinded, they can't hear anything.

03:55:39.122 --> 03:55:42.140
MATT: And what do they have to make, saving wise?

03:55:42.140 --> 03:55:46.684
TRAVIS: 15 dex save or they take 2d6 cold damage.

03:55:46.684 --> 03:55:48.625
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

03:55:48.625 --> 03:55:53.531
TRAVIS: Six, seven, so seven points.

03:55:53.531 --> 03:56:00.249
MATT: Seven points? All right, that's a natural 20
for the first bodyguard, so it takes three points, right?

03:56:00.249 --> 03:56:01.641
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:56:01.641 --> 03:56:10.369
MATT: All right. The other bodyguard. That's a
natural 18. And then for Algar, that is a 14, so

03:56:10.369 --> 03:56:14.524
he takes seven points of damage. He goes
unconscious.

03:56:14.524 --> 03:56:15.923
TALIESIN: Yes!

03:56:15.923 --> 03:56:17.146
TRAVIS: Algar does? Yeah!

03:56:17.146 --> 03:56:19.605
MARISHA: Fuck you!

03:56:19.605 --> 03:56:21.599
MATT: Not that you know that.

03:56:21.599 --> 03:56:22.745
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:56:22.745 --> 03:56:24.217
MARISHA: But I mean it's fine, it's great.

03:56:24.217 --> 03:56:28.942
MATT: All right, does that end your turn, Fjord?

03:56:28.942 --> 03:56:38.543
TRAVIS: Yes-- Yeah, I'm going to use the rest of
my movement to just come back out here.

03:56:38.543 --> 03:56:42.633
MATT: Okay, step out to the point? You got it. All
right, that brings us to Yasha's turn.

03:56:42.633 --> 03:56:52.597
ASHLEY: Okay, so. I'm going to attack this water
elemental where I can-- if I can see an open spot

03:56:52.597 --> 03:56:54.298
that Caduceus is not in.

03:56:54.298 --> 03:56:59.423
MATT: Caduceus is being swirled around on the
inside, his unconscious body just being kept with

03:56:59.423 --> 03:57:02.637
the current. So you're timing it for a moment and
go for a swing.

03:57:02.637 --> 03:57:05.383
TALIESIN: Also, technically wouldn't my beetles
get a bonus action anyway, or?

03:57:05.383 --> 03:57:09.218
MATT: The beetles, they just have their attack
increment. They don't have the full action

03:57:09.218 --> 03:57:10.934
spectrum.

03:57:10.934 --> 03:57:15.220
ASHLEY: Wait, do I get an extra roll?

03:57:15.220 --> 03:57:17.469
MATT: No, it's just a straight roll.

03:57:17.469 --> 03:57:18.873
TALIESIN: I thought that was cocked anyway, but
yeah.

03:57:18.873 --> 03:57:21.062
MATT: So the first attack was what?

03:57:21.062 --> 03:57:25.747
ASHLEY: The first attack was 16, but it was
cocked.

03:57:25.747 --> 03:57:27.207
MATT: Oh, it was cocked? Okay.

03:57:27.207 --> 03:57:33.184
ASHLEY: 19?

03:57:33.184 --> 03:57:36.883
MATT: 19 hits. So go ahead and roll damage for
that one.

03:57:36.883 --> 03:57:41.088
SAM: Oh boy. Oh boy.

03:57:41.088 --> 03:57:44.197
LAURA: That was such a gentle roll.

03:57:44.335 --> 03:57:50.486
TRAVIS: Like the flowers she collects.

03:57:50.486 --> 03:57:52.894
TALIESIN: Don't even-- I'm not rolling another
character.

03:57:52.894 --> 03:57:54.172
ASHLEY: 18.

03:57:54.172 --> 03:57:57.353
MATT: 18 points of damage on the first strike. You
carve through, you watch as a big piece of it

03:57:57.353 --> 03:58:03.127
splashes away. It's looking hurt. It's not heavy,
but you're starting to see some wear and tear on

03:58:03.127 --> 03:58:04.765
the creature. You make your second attack?

03:58:04.765 --> 03:58:06.707
ASHLEY: Does he look like he's getting loose at
all?

03:58:06.707 --> 03:58:09.115
MATT: No, it looks like he's still held in there.

03:58:09.115 --> 03:58:15.258
ASHLEY: Oh, fuck. And I don't get to roll again,
right?

03:58:15.258 --> 03:58:19.757
MATT: No, you don't have a means for getting
advantage. Remember, you have your reckless

03:58:19.757 --> 03:58:21.059
strikes.

03:58:21.059 --> 03:58:22.254
ASHLEY: Oh yes, let me do reckless.

03:58:22.254 --> 03:58:23.218
MATT: Is that what you wanted to do?

03:58:23.218 --> 03:58:24.041
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:58:24.041 --> 03:58:26.030
MATT: All right. Usually you say that at the top
of the turn but it's been a while so you can do that.

03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:28.823
ASHLEY: Okay that'll definitely hit.

03:58:28.823 --> 03:58:31.909
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm out of practice,
guys.

03:58:31.909 --> 03:58:33.017
MATT: It's all good, it's all good.

03:58:33.017 --> 03:58:39.797
ASHLEY: And I'm on east coast time. Okay, 24.

03:58:39.797 --> 03:58:41.379
MATT: 24 hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:58:41.379 --> 03:58:44.460
TRAVIS: Nice. Every little bit counts.

03:58:44.460 --> 03:58:47.984
ASHLEY: Ooh, okay. 15.

03:58:47.984 --> 03:58:53.801
MATT: 15. With the second carve carving through,
you are now cutting away almost like it's a

03:58:53.801 --> 03:58:58.926
gelatin dessert and you're seeing the pieces
sloughing off of it. It reforms back slowly but

03:58:58.926 --> 03:59:03.819
it's starting to sputter and bits of it are having
a hard time keeping itself as a full form. You can

03:59:03.819 --> 03:59:07.368
see foam gathering at the edges of it. That
finishes your turn? Are you going to move?

03:59:07.368 --> 03:59:10.101
ASHLEY: Yeah, because I can't take another attack.

03:59:10.101 --> 03:59:16.357
MATT: That's right, the beetles would have
probably clambered back into the staff when you

03:59:16.357 --> 03:59:17.333
fell unconscious.

03:59:17.333 --> 03:59:18.404
TALIESIN: Aw man, yeah.

03:59:18.404 --> 03:59:19.317
MATT: Sorry buddy.

03:59:19.317 --> 03:59:21.343
TALIESIN: It's okay, I was just hoping for even like
advantage or some such.

03:59:21.343 --> 03:59:23.653
ASHLEY: I'm going to back up a little bit.

03:59:23.725 --> 03:59:24.979
MATT: You're going to back up?

03:59:24.979 --> 03:59:26.832
ASHLEY: Well, will it get an attack of
opportunity?

03:59:26.832 --> 03:59:28.114
MATT: It will, yeah.

03:59:28.114 --> 03:59:29.548
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll just stay where I am.

03:59:29.548 --> 03:59:32.774
MATT: So you just continue engaged and holding it
in that moment. Okay, that ends Yasha's turn.

03:59:32.774 --> 03:59:38.863
Algar is going to make a death saving throw.
That's a failure.

03:59:38.863 --> 03:59:41.079
MARISHA: Yeah, stay dead, stay dead.

03:59:41.079 --> 03:59:42.406
LAURA: We don't want him to die.

03:59:42.406 --> 03:59:43.145
TRAVIS: We don't?

03:59:43.145 --> 03:59:44.107
TALIESIN: Why not?

03:59:44.107 --> 03:59:45.131
SAM: He just was mean.

03:59:45.131 --> 03:59:46.259
TRAVIS: I don't think he was clear on that.

03:59:46.259 --> 03:59:47.692
TALIESIN: He's running a fucking undead--

03:59:47.692 --> 03:59:49.388
MATT: All right, Caleb, your turn.

03:59:49.388 --> 03:59:52.875
LIAM: So what do I do? Concentration check, death
save? I don't know.

03:59:52.875 --> 03:59:54.554
MATT: No, make a constitution saving throw.

03:59:54.554 --> 03:59:57.772
LIAM: That is a six.

03:59:57.772 --> 04:00:02.933
MATT: That is a six? We're going to go ahead
and... say that you are in the beginning stages of

04:00:02.933 --> 04:00:09.777
drowning. So you can survive a number of rounds
equal to your constitution modifier.

04:00:09.777 --> 04:00:11.901
LIAM: So that's two?

04:00:11.901 --> 04:00:13.047
MATT: Two rounds, yeah.

04:00:13.047 --> 04:00:13.713
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

04:00:13.713 --> 04:00:14.777
MATT: So you have two more rounds before you
drown.

04:00:14.777 --> 04:00:15.762
LAURA: Okay, okay.

04:00:15.762 --> 04:00:19.115
TRAVIS: And when you drown, do you then have three
death saves or--

04:00:19.115 --> 04:00:20.026
MATT: Nope.

04:00:20.026 --> 04:00:25.276
TRAVIS: Or are you dead? Or just two rounds
in.

04:00:25.276 --> 04:00:29.258
TALIESIN: If I'm alive, it's fine. If I'm not
alive it's not okay.

04:00:29.258 --> 04:00:30.967
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, so don't worry.

04:00:30.967 --> 04:00:35.172
MATT: No, yeah, at the-- if you run out of breath
or are choking you survive the number of rounds

04:00:35.172 --> 04:00:38.119
equal to your constitution modifier. At the start
of your next turn, you drop to zero hit points and

04:00:38.119 --> 04:00:39.288
are dying.

04:00:39.288 --> 04:00:40.702
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's not <i>terrible.</i> It's bad.

04:00:40.702 --> 04:00:43.259
MARISHA: And are dy<i>ing.</i> Not dead.

04:00:43.259 --> 04:00:48.995
MATT: It gets a little weird. It gets a little
weird here. Because you're stabilized. You're

04:00:48.995 --> 04:00:50.534
stabilized by the necklace.

04:00:50.534 --> 04:00:52.116
MARISHA: Dying is not dead though.

04:00:52.116 --> 04:00:54.043
LAURA: So can he drown and then he stabilizes and
then he drowns and stabilizes?

04:00:54.043 --> 04:00:56.362
MATT: Kind of. It gets a little weird.

04:00:56.362 --> 04:00:57.462
LIAM: Just do whatever feels right.

04:00:57.462 --> 04:00:58.715
LAURA: That's must be stressful.

04:00:58.715 --> 04:01:00.040
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah very.

04:01:00.040 --> 04:01:01.338
SAM: He's being waterboarded.

04:01:01.338 --> 04:01:03.280
MATT: It is, yeah. We'll say--

04:01:03.280 --> 04:01:05.688
ASHLEY: It's waterboarding, basically.

04:01:05.688 --> 04:01:09.366
MATT: Kind of. So yeah, you're stabilized.

04:01:09.366 --> 04:01:10.360
LIAM: All right.

04:01:10.360 --> 04:01:12.240
MATT: And you're fine. Physically.

04:01:12.240 --> 04:01:13.525
TRAVIS: For two more rounds.

04:01:13.525 --> 04:01:14.614
LIAM: Well, there are dragons in this world.

04:01:14.614 --> 04:01:16.141
MATT: We'll see where it goes. We'll see where it
goes in two rounds.

04:01:16.141 --> 04:01:17.493
LIAM: Sure.

04:01:17.493 --> 04:01:18.867
MATT: All right. That ends Caleb's turn.

04:01:18.867 --> 04:01:19.983
LIAM: I have faith in you, Jester.

04:01:19.983 --> 04:01:22.375
MATT: Jester, you're up.

04:01:22.375 --> 04:01:23.233
LAURA: Okay.

04:01:23.233 --> 04:01:24.318
SAM: It's all up to you.

04:01:24.318 --> 04:01:29.549
LAURA: I'm going to step forward. I'm going to
stay away from the water thing. I'm going to use

04:01:29.549 --> 04:01:35.378
my duplicate to go forward and touch Caduceus.

04:01:35.378 --> 04:01:36.860
MATT: All righty.

04:01:36.860 --> 04:01:40.209
LAURA: And she's going to cast Cure Wounds at
third level.

04:01:40.209 --> 04:01:41.318
TALIESIN: Whoa!

04:01:41.318 --> 04:01:42.347
MATT: Go for it.

04:01:42.347 --> 04:01:44.388
LAURA: So that's 3d8.

04:01:44.388 --> 04:01:45.467
SAM: Wow!

04:01:45.467 --> 04:01:50.540
TRAVIS: Dude, I was <i>sweating.</i>

04:01:50.540 --> 04:01:51.788
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:01:51.788 --> 04:01:59.485
LAURA: So that is (counting) 19 points of health.

04:01:59.485 --> 04:02:00.875
SAM: Hey!

04:02:00.875 --> 04:02:01.932
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

04:02:01.932 --> 04:02:09.945
LAURA: And then with me, I'm going to Sacred
Flame. For myself.

04:02:09.945 --> 04:02:13.265
MATT: Well, Cure Wounds is still an action, so you
can't do both in one round, unfortunately.

04:02:13.265 --> 04:02:15.336
LAURA: Just kidding!

04:02:15.336 --> 04:02:17.649
(giggling)

04:02:17.649 --> 04:02:19.338
LAURA: I'm going to--

04:02:19.338 --> 04:02:21.593
MATT: Spiritual Weapon is still somewhere in those
tentacles but you can't see where that is.

04:02:21.593 --> 04:02:24.743
LAURA: I'm just going to flail around with the
Spiritual Weapon and hope I hit something.

04:02:24.743 --> 04:02:26.469
MATT: Make an attack with disadvantage.

04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:28.896
MARISHA: Can a tentacle wield the lollipop?

04:02:28.896 --> 04:02:30.914
MATT: We'll say that probably happens there.

04:02:30.914 --> 04:02:32.747
MARISHA: Yeah! That's fun.

04:02:32.747 --> 04:02:34.820
ALL: (groaning)

04:02:34.820 --> 04:02:36.307
TALIESIN: Goddamn it! It was so good.

04:02:36.307 --> 04:02:38.988
LAURA: It's okay, it's a 15. But the other one was
a natural 20.

04:02:38.988 --> 04:02:40.117
MATT: Oh, got you.

04:02:40.117 --> 04:02:41.417
ASHLEY: (groans)

04:02:41.417 --> 04:02:47.467
MATT: It unfortunately does not hit anybody
because of the-- the one that it strikes has a

04:02:47.467 --> 04:02:49.069
higher armor class than 15 but--

04:02:49.069 --> 04:02:56.049
TRAVIS: I forgot something. When Algar starts his
turn you take 2d6 cold damage. So he was--

04:02:56.049 --> 04:02:57.233
LIAM: He was dead.

04:02:57.233 --> 04:02:58.204
MARISHA: (gasps)

04:02:58.204 --> 04:02:59.151
TALIESIN: Technically--

04:02:59.151 --> 04:03:00.230
MATT: Well no, he's at two death saves.

04:03:00.230 --> 04:03:01.306
TRAVIS: Yeah. He'll be at two instead of one.

04:03:01.306 --> 04:03:02.235
MATT: Yeah.

04:03:02.235 --> 04:03:04.031
MARISHA: But I thought he takes down two when he's
dead?

04:03:04.031 --> 04:03:05.124
LIAM: No, that's at a melee attack.

04:03:05.124 --> 04:03:06.149
MATT: That's a melee attack that does that.

04:03:06.149 --> 04:03:06.912
LIAM: Yeah.

04:03:06.912 --> 04:03:07.835
MARISHA: Ooh.

04:03:07.835 --> 04:03:10.837
MATT: Okay. That ends Jester's turn?

04:03:10.837 --> 04:03:11.833
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

04:03:11.833 --> 04:03:15.338
SAM: He won't even know why he was dead, though. We
didn't even to tell him it was from

04:03:15.338 --> 04:03:17.111
the Ruby of the Sea.

04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.956
TRAVIS: I did.

04:03:17.956 --> 04:03:18.728
SAM: Oh.

04:03:18.728 --> 04:03:19.749
MARISHA: Don't be a fucking creep!

04:03:19.749 --> 04:03:21.674
LAURA: I'm going to move my own person towards
Caleb.

04:03:21.674 --> 04:03:22.644
MATT: Yeah.

04:03:22.644 --> 04:03:24.330
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to move me towards Caleb.

04:03:24.330 --> 04:03:25.174
MATT: Okay.

04:03:25.174 --> 04:03:26.523
MARISHA: It's very extreme. It's <i>very</i> extreme.

04:03:26.523 --> 04:03:28.983
MATT: Going past to get there, the water elemental
gets an attack of opportunity on you.

04:03:28.983 --> 04:03:30.380
LAURA: Oh, he does?!

04:03:30.459 --> 04:03:31.248
MATT: He does.

04:03:31.248 --> 04:03:32.397
LAURA: Oh, I didn't realize it was within range.

04:03:32.397 --> 04:03:33.517
MATT: Well, now you know.

04:03:33.517 --> 04:03:34.425
LIAM: He's a big guy.

04:03:34.425 --> 04:03:36.060
MATT: That's going to be a 17 to hit?

04:03:36.060 --> 04:03:37.210
LAURA: He doesn't hit me.

04:03:37.210 --> 04:03:38.095
MATT: He doesn't hit you?

04:03:38.095 --> 04:03:39.133
LAURA: I have a shield.

04:03:39.133 --> 04:03:40.622
MATT: (clanging) You shrug it off from your armor
and shield.

04:03:40.622 --> 04:03:41.695
LIAM and LAURA: (clanging)

04:03:41.695 --> 04:03:44.489
MATT: That's your full movement there.

04:03:44.489 --> 04:03:45.205
LAURA: Okay.

04:03:45.205 --> 04:03:46.457
MATT: All right, does that end your turn?

04:03:46.457 --> 04:03:47.485
LAURA: Yeah.

04:03:47.485 --> 04:03:50.903
MATT: That brings us to the compatriots here. At the
top of their turn they take how much damage?

04:03:50.903 --> 04:03:52.996
TRAVIS: 2d6?

04:03:53.022 --> 04:03:54.154
LAURA: (gasps)

04:03:54.154 --> 04:03:56.841
MATT: 2d6? Go ahead and roll 2d6. For both of the
dwarven bodyguards.

04:03:56.841 --> 04:03:57.939
TRAVIS: For both of the bodyguards?

04:03:57.939 --> 04:04:00.546
LAURA: Could I have used my Hellish Rebuke? If he
didn't actually hit me?

04:04:00.546 --> 04:04:02.111
MATT: You can use your reaction to, you can,
yeah.

04:04:02.111 --> 04:04:03.524
LAURA: Yeah! I want to use my Hellish Rebuke.

04:04:03.524 --> 04:04:07.745
MATT: Well, no, if it didn't hit you I don't
think. Does it say an attack or a hit? I believe

04:04:07.745 --> 04:04:10.081
it has to be a hit, doesn't it? When you're
damaged?

04:04:10.081 --> 04:04:11.970
SAM and LAURA: Actions.

04:04:11.970 --> 04:04:13.973
LAURA: Actions, reactions.

04:04:13.973 --> 04:04:15.256
TRAVIS: Five points of acid damage.

04:04:15.256 --> 04:04:18.266
MATT: Gotcha. So those left standing--

04:04:18.266 --> 04:04:20.080
TRAVIS: Sorry, full damage. Full damage.

04:04:20.080 --> 04:04:21.392
MATT: Just barely. Full damage.

04:04:21.392 --> 04:04:26.312
TRAVIS: They do take-- if they do their dexterity
saving throw they take half. Again. It says that

04:04:26.312 --> 04:04:27.230
if you--

04:04:27.230 --> 04:04:28.181
MATT: Oh, dex save every turn?

04:04:28.181 --> 04:04:29.067
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:04:29.067 --> 04:04:34.832
MATT: A success and a fail-- no, both successes
actually. Both rolled really high that round. All

04:04:34.832 --> 04:04:39.999
right, so two damage to each, actually. All right,
and they can't see anything. They both haven't

04:04:39.999 --> 04:04:45.794
moved since the last thing happened, so one
reaches down and you hear some rummaging. He gets

04:04:45.794 --> 04:04:47.089
dragged--

04:04:47.089 --> 04:04:48.379
TRAVIS: Their speed is halved.

04:04:48.379 --> 04:04:49.584
MATT: Yeah.

04:04:49.584 --> 04:04:51.047
LIAM: Wilhelm scream?

04:04:51.047 --> 04:04:54.882
MATT: Yeah, no, he can't drag him out of there.
It's not enough movement for him to get in so--

04:04:54.882 --> 04:04:56.017
ASHLEY: Yes.

04:04:56.017 --> 04:04:57.503
TRAVIS: It's a big ass sphere.

04:04:57.503 --> 04:04:59.654
MATT: Other one's just going to move into this
space here.

04:04:59.654 --> 04:05:01.965
MARISHA: So if you move into that sphere, is it
utter blackness?

04:05:01.965 --> 04:05:03.317
MATT and TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:05:03.317 --> 04:05:05.424
MARISHA: If I have dark vision goggles--

04:05:05.424 --> 04:05:06.344
MATT and TRAVIS: Nope.

04:05:06.344 --> 04:05:07.199
MARISHA: Does it help?

04:05:07.199 --> 04:05:08.707
TRAVIS: Nope, just blind. E'rrybody blind.

04:05:08.707 --> 04:05:10.118
TRAVIS: Rummaging around.

04:05:10.118 --> 04:05:22.081
MATT: You hear some more rummaging. You hear a,
"(grunts) What the fuck?" That's it.

04:05:22.081 --> 04:05:24.378
LIAM: That's what I'd do.

04:05:24.378 --> 04:05:26.380
LAURA: Yeah. Screams, ahh!

04:05:26.380 --> 04:05:28.500
MATT: Sounds like Algar's voice.

04:05:28.500 --> 04:05:32.071
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh! Nice.

04:05:32.071 --> 04:05:33.058
LAURA: Sounds like what?

04:05:33.058 --> 04:05:34.169
LIAM: Oh, fed him a potion.

04:05:34.169 --> 04:05:38.190
MATT: His bodyguards are prepped with a few
things. Nott, your turn.

04:05:38.304 --> 04:05:44.072
SAM: Sure, I'd just like to point out that your
mom said, "This guy's been bothering me a little,"

04:05:44.072 --> 04:05:47.654
and we blew him up, and attacked him with
tentacles.

04:05:47.654 --> 04:05:50.152
MATT: Yeah!

04:05:50.152 --> 04:05:52.816
SAM: "He's just been a little annoying."

04:05:52.816 --> 04:05:54.506
LAURA: You defend your mom.

04:05:54.506 --> 04:05:56.926
TALIESIN: It got bigger when we got in here,
that's my feeling.

04:05:56.926 --> 04:05:58.492
MARISHA: Don't fuck with someone's mom.

04:05:58.492 --> 04:06:04.571
SAM: I don't know what's going on with Caleb so I
will move over toward Yasha.

04:06:04.571 --> 04:06:07.336
MATT: All right.

04:06:07.336 --> 04:06:09.467
SAM: Check in on my boy.

04:06:09.467 --> 04:06:12.934
MATT: He's currently facedown, floating in the
water.

04:06:12.934 --> 04:06:13.929
SAM: Ahh!

04:06:13.929 --> 04:06:17.461
(laughter)

04:06:17.461 --> 04:06:25.726
SAM: I see Jester over there and I know that she
does have the ability to heal so I will-- Wow, I

04:06:25.726 --> 04:06:26.949
don't know if I trust her.

04:06:26.949 --> 04:06:29.810
TRAVIS: He's currently face down in the water.

04:06:29.810 --> 04:06:31.304
SAM: He's face down in <i>the water.</i>

04:06:31.304 --> 04:06:32.802
LAURA: Come on, I heal people.

04:06:32.802 --> 04:06:36.845
SAM: Nope, can't trust you. I will just burn all
my actions to do it myself.

04:06:36.845 --> 04:06:38.411
TRAVIS: Agency breakup.

04:06:38.411 --> 04:06:39.968
MATT: So five--

04:06:39.968 --> 04:06:42.327
SAM: Am I within 30 feet of Caleb?

04:06:42.327 --> 04:06:45.937
MATT: 30? There you'll run back in the water.

04:06:45.937 --> 04:06:50.705
SAM: No, back where I was with Yasha am I within
30 feet of him?

04:06:50.705 --> 04:06:52.989
MATT: No you're a little further away.

04:06:52.989 --> 04:06:54.781
SAM: Okay I'll get another ten feet closer.

04:06:54.781 --> 04:06:58.560
MATT: That'll get you there. You can probably get
him. It's 30 feet from you there.

04:06:58.560 --> 04:07:05.644
SAM: I will use my Mage Hand to take a healing
potion out of my hand and shoot it 30 feet towards him.

04:07:05.644 --> 04:07:07.084
MATT: Mage Hand was here last.

04:07:07.084 --> 04:07:10.576
SAM: I will cast it again using an action, next to
me.

04:07:10.576 --> 04:07:11.634
MATT: Okay.

04:07:11.634 --> 04:07:13.504
SAM: Grab my potion and take it.

04:07:13.504 --> 04:07:14.997
MATT: Okay, I'll let that happen.

04:07:14.997 --> 04:07:18.817
SAM: And then I will use my bonus action to use my
Mage Hand to pour it into his gullet.

04:07:18.817 --> 04:07:20.806
MATT: Sure, I'll let you do that.

04:07:20.806 --> 04:07:21.954
TRAVIS: Yeah!

04:07:21.954 --> 04:07:23.357
LIAM: It shoots under the water.

04:07:23.357 --> 04:07:24.366
SAM: Oh shit.

04:07:24.366 --> 04:07:27.517
MATT: You watch as his unconscious body goes--

04:07:27.517 --> 04:07:29.215
(laughter)

04:07:29.215 --> 04:07:33.637
MATT: The sheer force of the vial being jammed
into his mouth. Caleb, make a strength saving

04:07:33.637 --> 04:07:39.554
throw.

04:07:39.554 --> 04:07:43.636
LIAM: Strength saving throw. Natural 20.

04:07:43.636 --> 04:07:46.380
MATT: You do not break any teeth.

04:07:46.380 --> 04:07:50.219
LIAM: Thanks, Pike die.

04:07:50.219 --> 04:07:57.241
MATT: Damn it, I was hoping-- having a crystal vial
jammed with that speed into your mouth there was a

04:07:57.241 --> 04:07:58.759
good chance you were going to lose a tooth or
two.

04:07:58.759 --> 04:08:01.577
LIAM: Yep, just deep-throated it.

04:08:01.577 --> 04:08:03.100
MARISHA: Could have made you more charming.

04:08:03.100 --> 04:08:06.961
MATT: So go ahead and roll heal for Caleb.

04:08:06.961 --> 04:08:08.708
SAM: I roll heal, what do I roll?

04:08:08.708 --> 04:08:11.411
MATT: Was it a basic healing potion? 2d4 plus two.

04:08:11.484 --> 04:08:12.706
SAM: 2d4.

04:08:12.706 --> 04:08:13.653
LAURA: Ooh!

04:08:13.653 --> 04:08:14.918
LIAM: Just got to relax.

04:08:14.918 --> 04:08:15.994
SAM: Seven.

04:08:15.994 --> 04:08:17.129
LIAM: Hey!

04:08:17.129 --> 04:08:18.346
MATT: Heal seven hit points, there you go.

04:08:18.346 --> 04:08:20.354
SAM: That's it.

04:08:20.354 --> 04:08:22.489
MATT: That ends Nott's turn. Beau, you're up.

04:08:22.489 --> 04:08:24.919
MARISHA: Oh shit! It's me. Okay.

04:08:24.919 --> 04:08:34.245
MATT: There's just a black sphere and occasionally
you see this dark, strange, grayish, slime-covered

04:08:34.245 --> 04:08:36.085
tentacles that whip out and back into the--

04:08:36.085 --> 04:08:37.129
TRAVIS: That's mine!

04:08:37.129 --> 04:08:41.937
MARISHA: I was going to say, I look over at Fjord
across the parapet and I go: Ah, what--

04:08:41.937 --> 04:08:42.615
TRAVIS: That's me.

04:08:42.615 --> 04:08:43.917
MARISHA: But how do I--

04:08:43.917 --> 04:08:44.808
TRAVIS: Don't go in there.

04:08:44.808 --> 04:08:54.365
MARISHA: What do I do though, then? Fuck! I am
going to--

04:08:54.365 --> 04:08:56.119
TRAVIS: I mean homie is right next to you.

04:08:56.119 --> 04:08:57.806
MARISHA: I don't want to hurt him.

04:08:57.806 --> 04:08:59.628
TRAVIS: Well, he going to hurt you.

04:08:59.628 --> 04:09:08.539
MARISHA: I want to move away from genie homie, and
then hold my action for--

04:09:08.539 --> 04:09:09.931
MATT: Move away from him right there you mean?

04:09:09.931 --> 04:09:14.715
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to move away from him and
I'm going to hold my action until I can see

04:09:14.715 --> 04:09:22.414
preferably Aldar, but if not, one of the dwarves.

04:09:22.414 --> 04:09:23.506
MATT: Okay, got you.

04:09:23.506 --> 04:09:24.629
MARISHA: Algar, not Aldar.

04:09:24.629 --> 04:09:25.530
MATT: Okay.

04:09:25.530 --> 04:09:26.462
MARISHA: Al Gore.

04:09:26.462 --> 04:09:27.352
MATT: Got you. Finishes your turn?

04:09:27.352 --> 04:09:28.353
MARISHA: Holding my action.

04:09:28.353 --> 04:09:33.621
MATT: Beau's holding that. Top of the round is the
water elemental. It's going to go ahead and move over--

04:09:33.621 --> 04:09:35.510
SAM: Get him Jester!

04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:41.429
MATT: It's still carrying Caduceus along. You get
to go ahead and make an attack of opportunity to

04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:43.034
see if it shifts.

04:09:43.034 --> 04:09:44.468
SAM: Come on Yash.

04:09:44.468 --> 04:09:45.911
MATT: Because you have the Sentinel feat.

04:09:45.911 --> 04:09:48.239
ASHLEY: Ooh, ten.

04:09:48.239 --> 04:09:50.911
MATT: Ten does not hit. Goes wide unfortunately.

04:09:50.911 --> 04:09:52.033
TRAVIS: Reckless?

04:09:52.033 --> 04:09:53.171
SAM: Even though you're raging?

04:09:53.171 --> 04:09:54.174
ASHLEY: Oh, reckless! Reckless.

04:09:54.174 --> 04:09:56.333
MATT: Does reckless last until the end of your
turn or until--

04:09:56.333 --> 04:09:57.618
TRAVIS: You can do it every turn.

04:09:57.618 --> 04:10:01.537
MATT: Yeah, but it's out of her turn; this is a
reaction. Let me double check real fast.

04:10:01.537 --> 04:10:04.923
TALIESIN: Anything not to go unconscious again.

04:10:04.923 --> 04:10:11.237
SAM and LAURA: Zsundie, Zsundie, Zsundie.

04:10:11.237 --> 04:10:16.677
MATT: During this turn, it doesn't work towards
reactions unfortunately, so swings wide. It's

04:10:16.677 --> 04:10:24.219
going to go ahead and move in. Let's see if it
means-- yeah, it gets its Whelm back. It's going

04:10:24.219 --> 04:10:29.739
to go ahead and move into Jester's space so now
both Jester and Caduceus are caught inside--

04:10:29.739 --> 04:10:31.081
LAURA: Is it attacking me?

04:10:31.081 --> 04:10:33.422
MATT: It's going to attempt to, I need you to make
a dexterity saving throw.

04:10:33.422 --> 04:10:35.518
SAM: I'm glad I saved Caleb.

04:10:35.518 --> 04:10:41.834
LAURA: That was an aggressive roll. Seven.

04:10:41.834 --> 04:10:44.607
MATT: So you are currently restrained. You're
grappled and restrained.

04:10:44.607 --> 04:10:45.701
LAURA: Okay.

04:10:45.701 --> 04:10:47.206
MARISHA: Both of our clerics are grappled and
restrained.

04:10:47.206 --> 04:10:48.406
SAM: Yeah, but they're alive.

04:10:48.406 --> 04:10:49.518
TALIESIN: Not for long.

04:10:49.518 --> 04:10:52.379
LAURA: Okay, does he do damage to me at all?

04:10:52.379 --> 04:11:01.217
MATT: You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage.

04:11:01.217 --> 04:11:02.562
LAURA: Hellish Rebuke.

04:11:02.562 --> 04:11:06.862
MATT: So, constitution saving throw?

04:11:06.862 --> 04:11:08.071
TRAVIS: In the belly of the beast.

04:11:08.071 --> 04:11:09.642
LAURA: That is, yes.

04:11:09.642 --> 04:11:16.880
MATT: Regardless, that is a-- hold on, what is the
save type on that?

04:11:16.880 --> 04:11:18.341
LAURA: Dexterity.

04:11:18.341 --> 04:11:22.034
MATT: Dexterity, that is going to be a 13. That's
11 plus two. That's a failure, I believe, on your DC.

04:11:22.034 --> 04:11:23.549
LAURA: No it's not.

04:11:23.549 --> 04:11:25.221
MATT: Oh, because it's a racial ability?

04:11:25.221 --> 04:11:26.401
LAURA: Yeah, it's a 12.

04:11:26.401 --> 04:11:27.642
MATT: Oh yeah, so no.

04:11:27.642 --> 04:11:29.739
TRAVIS: Ooh, by one.

04:11:29.739 --> 04:11:30.685
MATT: Takes half damage right?

04:11:30.685 --> 04:11:33.066
LAURA: Half damage! Okay so that's still 3d10 of
cold damage

04:11:33.066 --> 04:11:35.052
SAM: That's a lot! You could freeze it.

04:11:35.052 --> 04:11:36.727
TRAVIS: And cold damage hurts more?

04:11:36.727 --> 04:11:38.999
MATT: Yeah, reduces its speed by 20 feet until the
end of its next turn.

04:11:38.999 --> 04:11:41.796
LAURA: (counting) 11.

04:11:41.796 --> 04:11:43.200
MATT: 11 points of damage.

04:11:43.200 --> 04:11:46.993
SAM: Okay. That was, I wouldn't say hellish.

04:11:46.993 --> 04:11:51.664
MATT: As it reaches and gets a little frozen and
its movement is a little sluggish. It's looking

04:11:51.664 --> 04:11:52.713
really hurt.

04:11:52.713 --> 04:11:55.204
LAURA: And what was it? 13 damage?

04:11:55.204 --> 04:12:02.215
MATT: 13 points of bludgeoning damage. And because
technically Caduceus is still--

04:12:02.215 --> 04:12:03.951
SAM: Oh no.

04:12:03.951 --> 04:12:11.497
MATT: At the top of the turn. No, because you got
healed by Jester so you also take 13 points of

04:12:11.497 --> 04:12:12.592
bludgeoning damage.

04:12:12.592 --> 04:12:13.697
LAURA: Okay, we're still alive.

04:12:13.697 --> 04:12:14.969
TALIESIN: Yep, still alive.

04:12:14.969 --> 04:12:17.301
MATT: So that's going to end--

04:12:17.301 --> 04:12:18.810
TALIESIN: That's all I needed was just to survive
the round.

04:12:18.810 --> 04:12:23.928
MATT: The water elemental's turn. It's now
Zsundie's turn. Zsundie is going to fly into the

04:12:23.928 --> 04:12:25.827
air right up here.

04:12:25.827 --> 04:12:27.115
LAURA: Oh no.

04:12:27.115 --> 04:12:35.295
MATT: And release another water jet through to
both Beau and Fjord. I need you both to make

04:12:35.295 --> 04:12:36.873
dexterity saving throws please.

04:12:36.873 --> 04:12:39.423
MARISHA: Oh dex saves. Me and Fjord?

04:12:39.423 --> 04:12:40.336
MATT: You and Fjord.

04:12:40.336 --> 04:12:41.676
SAM: This is rough.

04:12:41.676 --> 04:12:42.777
MARISHA: Dex save.

04:12:42.777 --> 04:12:44.010
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, sorry.

04:12:44.010 --> 04:12:46.591
SAM: Fjord just went to a dark place

04:12:46.591 --> 04:12:48.414
TRAVIS: 16.

04:12:48.414 --> 04:12:49.474
MARISHA: 15.

04:12:49.474 --> 04:12:52.608
MATT: You succeed, Fjord. You fail.

04:12:52.608 --> 04:12:56.889
MARISHA: What!? I rolled one less than him?

04:12:56.889 --> 04:12:58.272
MATT: It's DC 16.

04:12:58.272 --> 04:12:59.454
SAM: But you love her.

04:12:59.454 --> 04:13:02.849
MATT: So that's going to be 21 points of
bludgeoning damage to you.

04:13:02.849 --> 04:13:05.896
MARISHA: How many?

04:13:05.896 --> 04:13:08.903
MATT: 21 points. And ten points to you, Fjord. I
need you to make a constitution saving throw to

04:13:08.903 --> 04:13:10.395
see if you maintain concentration.

04:13:10.395 --> 04:13:13.564
TRAVIS: Oh, right. That's a natural 19 plus four.

04:13:13.564 --> 04:13:20.511
MATT: You do, you succeed. And with that it's
going to go ahead and continue flying, coasting

04:13:20.511 --> 04:13:26.512
around out of your range, and turning his
attention towards the center column there.

04:13:26.512 --> 04:13:28.043
TRAVIS: Do we get knocked back by the jets?

04:13:28.043 --> 04:13:29.528
LIAM: I got knocked for failing.

04:13:29.528 --> 04:13:34.069
MATT: No, you do. I'm getting to that point right
now. So on a success you are neither pushed nor

04:13:34.069 --> 04:13:37.226
prone, but you do (launching sound).

04:13:37.226 --> 04:13:39.961
MARISHA: Do I-- (yelling) Catch me! Aw fuck.

04:13:39.961 --> 04:13:47.841
MATT: 20 feet back technically, so you would
(crashing sound) right in the ground there. You

04:13:47.841 --> 04:13:51.998
sploosh into the water and you are prone down at
the bottom again. So that ends his go. Caduceus.

04:13:51.998 --> 04:13:54.821
SAM: Caducey, do something.

04:13:54.821 --> 04:14:03.008
MATT: At the top of your turn, because you are
still whelmed you take seven points of bludgeoning

04:14:03.008 --> 04:14:03.944
damage.

04:14:03.944 --> 04:14:05.048
TALIESIN: And I'm out.

04:14:05.048 --> 04:14:08.505
MATT: Staying in that water elemental is not good
news.

04:14:08.505 --> 04:14:11.933
TALIESIN: I have had nothing I could do this
round.

04:14:11.933 --> 04:14:13.889
MATT: I know. End of your turn, make a death
saving throw.

04:14:13.889 --> 04:14:20.211
TALIESIN: 11.

04:14:20.211 --> 04:14:21.459
LAURA: Okay.

04:14:21.459 --> 04:14:26.253
MATT: Fjord, your turn.

04:14:26.253 --> 04:14:30.141
TRAVIS: So would dropping Hunger of Hadar be an
action?

04:14:30.141 --> 04:14:31.328
MATT: No, you just drop the spell.

04:14:31.328 --> 04:14:32.704
TRAVIS: You just drop it.

04:14:32.704 --> 04:14:33.935
MATT: Yep.

04:14:33.935 --> 04:14:47.081
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to use my speed to enter
the hallway. Five, ten, 20 before I get to the thing.

04:14:47.081 --> 04:14:56.558
SAM: (whispering) Your animals are with you.

04:14:56.558 --> 04:15:00.447
TRAVIS: Do you need to get out of waterfuck?

04:15:00.447 --> 04:15:01.578
TALIESIN: I mean...

04:15:01.578 --> 04:15:03.320
SAM: (whispering) Your animals can't breathe.

04:15:03.320 --> 04:15:10.764
TALIESIN: So many things need to happen. No matter
what we're pretty fucked right now. This is

04:15:10.764 --> 04:15:11.891
terrible.

04:15:11.891 --> 04:15:15.188
TRAVIS: You know what? Fuck those guys! I'm going
to stay right where I am, where I can still see

04:15:15.188 --> 04:15:21.052
the water thing and I'll send two Eldritch Blasts
toward the water where Clay is. I don't give a

04:15:21.052 --> 04:15:22.213
fuck about Algar.

04:15:22.213 --> 04:15:24.893
MATT: To the water elemental? Go for it. And
you're not doing anything else, right?

04:15:24.893 --> 04:15:25.678
TRAVIS: No.

04:15:25.678 --> 04:15:30.271
TALIESIN: And make sure you're not going to hit
Jester or I in any of those hits either. That will

04:15:30.271 --> 04:15:32.054
kill us.

04:15:32.054 --> 04:15:34.083
MATT: Roll your attacks.

04:15:34.083 --> 04:15:40.577
ASHLEY: I can also grab him out next turn. I don't
know.

04:15:40.577 --> 04:15:41.750
TRAVIS: Okay, because you're in it.

04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:42.520
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:15:42.520 --> 04:15:43.854
TRAVIS: But if I hit the wave it'll hit them.

04:15:43.854 --> 04:15:44.952
MATT: You don't know.

04:15:44.952 --> 04:15:46.109
TRAVIS: Let's--

04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:47.457
MATT: Yasha hasn't had an issue with it yet.

04:15:47.457 --> 04:15:49.624
TALIESIN: And regardless there's a genie, so.

04:15:49.624 --> 04:15:50.901
LIAM: And what's the initiative order? It's Fjord
then...

04:15:50.901 --> 04:15:52.151
MATT: Fjord then Yasha.

04:15:52.151 --> 04:15:55.288
TRAVIS: Let's not do that. I'm going to drop
Hunger of Hadar and I'm going to send two Eldritch

04:15:55.288 --> 04:15:57.255
Blasts at both of the bodyguards.

04:15:57.255 --> 04:16:02.161
MATT: Okay. As you drop Hunger of Hadar you can
see they're both looking rather ragged and Algar

04:16:02.161 --> 04:16:07.736
is on the ground, coughing and sputtering as one
of the bodyguards is pulling and tosses an empty

04:16:07.736 --> 04:16:11.539
health potion to the ground that shatters. As soon
as it goes dark they both go "Huh!" and all three

04:16:11.539 --> 04:16:13.482
of them look at you. Go ahead and roll attacks for
both the bodyguards.

04:16:13.482 --> 04:16:16.498
TRAVIS: That is a 12 for the first one.

04:16:16.498 --> 04:16:17.732
MATT: That misses that guy.

04:16:17.732 --> 04:16:21.845
TRAVIS: And 16 on the second one.

04:16:21.845 --> 04:16:23.038
MATT: 16 does hit him.

04:16:23.038 --> 04:16:24.084
TRAVIS: Nice.

04:16:24.084 --> 04:16:28.126
TALIESIN: Fucking Algar, man.

04:16:28.126 --> 04:16:32.465
TRAVIS: That is ten points of damage.

04:16:32.465 --> 04:16:39.945
MATT: Falls unconscious on the ground (impact).
Hits the wall, (grunts) and crumples into a pile,

04:16:39.945 --> 04:16:41.157
unconscious.

04:16:41.157 --> 04:16:45.725
TRAVIS: Five, ten, 15, and I'll use the rest of my
30 feet to get as close as I can.

04:16:45.725 --> 04:16:46.820
MATT: All right.

04:16:46.820 --> 04:16:49.858
MARISHA: You're going to Aldar? Algar? Al Gore?

04:16:49.858 --> 04:16:50.832
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:16:50.832 --> 04:16:56.924
MATT: 15, 20, 25-- You can move right up into the
space right next-- looking down at Algar right

04:16:56.924 --> 04:16:58.672
now. End your turn?

04:16:58.672 --> 04:16:59.862
TRAVIS: Yes.

04:16:59.862 --> 04:17:00.977
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

04:17:00.977 --> 04:17:03.009
(heavy metal guitar starts)

04:17:03.009 --> 04:17:05.192
ASHLEY: I'm going to go up and try to stabby-stab
what I can.

04:17:05.192 --> 04:17:06.434
MATT: Go for it.

04:17:06.434 --> 04:17:13.586
ASHLEY: Okay. (whispers) Oh my god.

04:17:13.586 --> 04:17:16.543
SAM: Yes! Heavy metal when Yasha talks!

04:17:16.543 --> 04:17:17.551
TRAVIS: Yep.

04:17:17.551 --> 04:17:21.025
ASHLEY: First is 13.

04:17:21.025 --> 04:17:24.091
MATT: 13 does not hit. That's with advantage?

04:17:24.091 --> 04:17:25.082
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:17:25.082 --> 04:17:26.090
MATT: Okay.

04:17:26.090 --> 04:17:27.554
ASHLEY: Fuck. Second hit?

04:17:27.554 --> 04:17:33.355
MATT: Second attack, also with advantage. It's for
all your attacks now.

04:17:33.355 --> 04:17:39.188
ASHLEY: Okay. 15?

04:17:39.188 --> 04:17:40.536
MATT: 15 does hit.

04:17:40.536 --> 04:17:42.981
TRAVIS: I have a question for you after her turn.

04:17:42.981 --> 04:17:51.206
ASHLEY: Okay nice! 17.

04:17:51.206 --> 04:17:52.691
MATT: 17 points of damage?

04:17:52.691 --> 04:17:53.578
ASHLEY: Yes.

04:17:53.578 --> 04:17:55.056
LAURA: Is he dead? Is he dead yet?

04:17:55.056 --> 04:17:58.858
MATT: As you strike through with your final strike
the blade carves right up the side and like

04:17:58.858 --> 04:18:08.386
cutting through a large wave it sprays up into the
ceiling and restores itself. Jester and Caduceus

04:18:08.386 --> 04:18:13.212
no longer being whelmed in it. You're still
unconscious, your animals are no longer drowning.

04:18:13.212 --> 04:18:14.430
LAURA: Yay!

04:18:14.430 --> 04:18:17.314
TRAVIS: Let's think about what's important here.

04:18:17.314 --> 04:18:26.031
ASHLEY: And then-- I don't have-- Hold on one
second, let me just check something really

04:18:26.031 --> 04:18:32.257
quickly. Okay that's an action, never mind. Okay,
I'd like to back up, if I can.

04:18:32.257 --> 04:18:33.209
MATT: This way?

04:18:33.209 --> 04:18:36.242
ASHLEY: Yes, behind this pole so I'm not in range
of--

04:18:36.242 --> 04:18:37.245
MATT: There?

04:18:37.245 --> 04:18:38.361
ASHLEY: Yeah. What's his fuck.

04:18:38.361 --> 04:18:39.533
MATT: Finishes your turn Yasha?

04:18:39.533 --> 04:18:40.395
ASHLEY: Yep.

04:18:40.395 --> 04:18:41.392
TRAVIS: I have a question.

04:18:41.392 --> 04:18:42.217
MATT: Yes?

04:18:42.217 --> 04:18:47.121
TRAVIS: So it says no action, when you slay a
humanoid you can cause its spirit to rise as a

04:18:47.121 --> 04:18:49.346
specter that gains three temporary hit points?

04:18:49.346 --> 04:18:52.084
MATT: Is that an action, just has you do it?

04:18:52.084 --> 04:18:53.369
TRAVIS: It says no action.

04:18:53.369 --> 04:18:54.816
MATT: Then yeah, you can do that.

04:18:54.816 --> 04:18:58.065
TRAVIS: Once a long rest. So can I do that for the
bodyguard that I just slayed?

04:18:58.065 --> 04:18:58.985
MATT: Sure, yeah.

04:18:58.985 --> 04:19:00.959
ASHLEY: Oh, hell yeah.

04:19:00.959 --> 04:19:07.065
TRAVIS: I'll just reach forward and say: Let none
pass.

04:19:07.065 --> 04:19:15.041
MATT: You watch as this dark-- you guys don't see
this-- Algar looks to his left as the body of his

04:19:15.041 --> 04:19:19.812
bodyguard which has been blown in the chest falls
over and immediately bleeds out and dies. This

04:19:19.812 --> 04:19:26.311
darkened shadow begins to tug and drag out of its
body. You watch as this spectral ghost that has

04:19:26.311 --> 04:19:34.936
faint barnacles and elements of dripping sea foam
and thick ocean water drooling out of its jaw

04:19:34.936 --> 04:19:39.248
emerges and stands over going (sinister
breathing).

04:19:39.248 --> 04:19:40.647
ASHLEY: Oh, that's awesome!

04:19:40.647 --> 04:19:42.220
TRAVIS: I didn't know it was going to do that.

04:19:42.220 --> 04:19:48.270
MATT: Algar right now is-- If it wasn't so
generally wet in the chamber, you could see the

04:19:48.270 --> 04:19:54.238
puddle forming under him. He is bludgeoned,
beaten, slimed within an inch of his life and is

04:19:54.238 --> 04:19:57.564
looking at the specter, looking at you and is
like, (fearful noises).

04:19:57.564 --> 04:19:58.993
TRAVIS: Do not move.

04:19:58.993 --> 04:20:10.068
MATT: For his turn, he is going to cower. He is
just going to put his hands up and try and drag

04:20:10.068 --> 04:20:14.738
and put his back against the wall and is just
sputtering, unable to make a word. That brings us

04:20:14.738 --> 04:20:15.869
to Caleb's turn.

04:20:15.869 --> 04:20:19.417
LIAM: Could you clarify a rule for me, because
I've never tried to do this as a new magic user,

04:20:19.417 --> 04:20:27.709
newish, but to do a bonus action first-level
spell, could that be done in addition to a second?

04:20:27.709 --> 04:20:33.504
Or a third? I know there's a version of being able
to cast two spells at once if one's lower than the

04:20:33.504 --> 04:20:35.670
other but I can't remember what it is.

04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:40.131
MATT: It's a spell of first-level or higher, and a
cantrip.

04:20:40.131 --> 04:20:42.074
LIAM: And a cantrip. Okay, so forget that.

04:20:42.074 --> 04:20:46.102
MATT: There is a feat you can take at level eight
to do what you did in the last campaign.

04:20:46.102 --> 04:20:51.255
LIAM: Not interested. So Caleb pushes up, and if
we're in difficult terrain, what, can I move like

04:20:51.255 --> 04:20:52.749
five feet or something?

04:20:52.749 --> 04:20:54.384
MATT: You can move, I'll say two squares.

04:20:54.384 --> 04:20:57.991
LIAM: Two squares. Uh... I can't see shit.

04:20:57.991 --> 04:20:59.834
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Come back to the water
park.

04:20:59.834 --> 04:21:02.065
SAM: Action Park!

04:21:02.065 --> 04:21:04.448
(laughter)

04:21:04.448 --> 04:21:06.107
TRAVIS: Yes!

04:21:06.107 --> 04:21:08.652
TALIESIN: That's good. Wow. Deep.

04:21:08.652 --> 04:21:17.131
LIAM: I'm going to move-- I'm going to press right
up behind Jester-- right here. What I'm hoping to

04:21:17.131 --> 04:21:24.794
do is to pull out the same batshit and sulphur and
rub it in my hands really quick and then set my

04:21:24.794 --> 04:21:30.533
hands down on her shoulders to help me aim and
careen a Fireball to hit-- there's no wall there

04:21:30.533 --> 04:21:41.036
because it's invisible, but to hit the ceiling
above-- can't reach. Hit the ceiling here, so I

04:21:41.061 --> 04:21:44.051
can go bip bip bip to him, but hopefully nobody
else.

04:21:44.051 --> 04:21:45.554
MATT: To there, you mean?

04:21:45.554 --> 04:21:48.468
LIAM: Yeah. From the ceiling down to him.

04:21:48.468 --> 04:21:49.580
MATT: Okay.

04:21:49.580 --> 04:21:50.794
LIAM: Back corner of the room.

04:21:50.794 --> 04:21:51.965
MATT: Back corner of the room <i>here</i>, you mean?

04:21:51.965 --> 04:21:52.947
LIAM: Yeah.

04:21:52.947 --> 04:21:55.049
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you can do that.

04:21:55.049 --> 04:21:58.186
MARISHA: I turn into the fetal position to cower and
cover.

04:21:58.186 --> 04:22:03.588
TRAVIS: Yeah. Fucking True Lies. (explosion)

04:22:03.690 --> 04:22:05.257
MATT: 16 for his dexterity saving throw.

04:22:05.257 --> 04:22:07.830
LIAM: I think I'm <i>at</i> 16. Let me just
double-check. Okay, yep.

04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:10.051
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage. He takes half
damage.

04:22:10.051 --> 04:22:17.459
LIAM: (counting) Okay, so ten points of fire
damage.

04:22:17.459 --> 04:22:23.326
MATT: All right. First damage to Zsundie.
(explosion) As the flames subside and pull back,

04:22:23.326 --> 04:22:28.458
the evaporated water in the vicinity turns into
this cloud of mist that (hisses) around. Steam

04:22:28.458 --> 04:22:33.328
fills the upper chamber for a minute. And as the
steam pulls away from Zsundie, barely scathed by

04:22:33.328 --> 04:22:36.377
the Fireball, (growls) just glaring right at you,
Caleb.

04:22:36.377 --> 04:22:44.064
LIAM: Also, Frumpkin is going to go five, ten, 15,
20. Like that. Underwater.

04:22:44.064 --> 04:22:48.031
MATT: You got it. That ends your turn? Jester,
you're up.

04:22:48.031 --> 04:22:49.253
LAURA: Okay.

04:22:49.253 --> 04:22:51.254
SAM: Are we fighting this thing?

04:22:51.254 --> 04:22:57.078
LAURA: No, I don't want to, though! I'm going to--
you're still unconscious, though--

04:22:57.078 --> 04:22:58.307
TALIESIN: I'm still unconscious.

04:22:58.307 --> 04:23:06.424
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast (singsong) Cure
Wounds at third level. On Caduceus.

04:23:06.424 --> 04:23:07.620
MATT: All righty.

04:23:07.620 --> 04:23:10.207
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah.

04:23:10.207 --> 04:23:12.618
MARISHA: (singsong) Live at seven p.m.!

04:23:12.618 --> 04:23:17.341
LAURA: That's right. 18 plus four is 22 points of
health.

04:23:17.341 --> 04:23:18.486
MATT: Nice!

04:23:18.486 --> 04:23:19.871
TALIESIN: 22 points of health.

04:23:19.871 --> 04:23:24.327
LAURA: (singsong) Then for my bonus action I'm
going to swing around with the-- oh, I can see

04:23:24.327 --> 04:23:26.604
now! But I still can't see anything that's around
there.

04:23:26.604 --> 04:23:27.747
MATT: Yep. You can't see what's around there,
yeah.

04:23:27.747 --> 04:23:29.215
LAURA: That's okay! (slurred) Just going to do it
again.

04:23:29.215 --> 04:23:30.433
MATT: So make an attack with disadvantage.

04:23:30.433 --> 04:23:33.275
TALIESIN: Oh!

04:23:33.275 --> 04:23:34.931
LAURA: 19!

04:23:34.931 --> 04:23:37.190
MATT: 19 hits the other bodyguard! Go for it.

04:23:37.190 --> 04:23:38.332
SAM: <i>Wa-pang!</i>

04:23:38.332 --> 04:23:40.769
(gasps)

04:23:40.769 --> 04:23:42.325
LAURA: 12 points of damage!

04:23:42.325 --> 04:23:47.578
MATT: (impact) "Argh!" And you watch as two
armored feet (boof) on the side. The other armored

04:23:47.578 --> 04:23:57.878
guard collapses on the other side. Algar's seeing
this specter rising, this drowned wraith emerging

04:23:57.878 --> 04:24:02.547
from one bodyguard, and the other bodyguard
(smack) on the ground next to him. Looks up at

04:24:02.547 --> 04:24:05.798
Fjord, just stepping over and walking towards him
in the far corner.

04:24:05.798 --> 04:24:12.310
LAURA: I'm going to move to where I'm not in a
line with these people. I'm going to hop over as

04:24:12.310 --> 04:24:13.886
far as I can that way.

04:24:13.886 --> 04:24:21.507
MATT: So that would be (counting) right there.
Wading through the water as you get over. All

04:24:21.507 --> 04:24:26.229
righty. That ends your turn, Jester. Nott, you're
up.

04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:30.763
SAM: Oh boy. We're not going to-- are we going to
fight this thing?

04:24:30.763 --> 04:24:33.517
TALIESIN: What is your plan?

04:24:33.517 --> 04:24:36.965
SAM: My plan is to not fight this thing!

04:24:36.965 --> 04:24:38.255
LAURA: Then hide.

04:24:38.255 --> 04:24:42.003
SAM: Where am I?

04:24:42.003 --> 04:24:45.575
LAURA: Right there. You can stand up.

04:24:45.575 --> 04:24:53.092
SAM: I'm going to move that way again, past over
here. Around Yasha.

04:24:53.092 --> 04:24:58.896
MATT: Algar? Algar is--

04:24:58.896 --> 04:25:00.634
TRAVIS: No, the Szundie.

04:25:00.634 --> 04:25:01.702
MARISHA: He's after me.

04:25:01.702 --> 04:25:03.359
TRAVIS: Fuck.

04:25:03.359 --> 04:25:06.927
SAM: I will yell to-- what is it, Szundi?

04:25:06.927 --> 04:25:08.135
MATT: Szundie.

04:25:08.135 --> 04:25:18.567
SAM: Szundie? Junji? I will yell to Szundie, we
didn't want to hurt you! We respect and fear

04:25:18.567 --> 04:25:26.736
water! Look, my feet won't even sink into it, I
fear it so much! I bow before you!

04:25:26.736 --> 04:25:29.114
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

04:25:29.114 --> 04:25:31.408
MARISHA: Come on! Come on, Nott!

04:25:31.408 --> 04:25:34.062
SAM: Yeah! 11!

04:25:34.062 --> 04:25:36.484
(laughter)

04:25:36.484 --> 04:25:44.458
MATT: Unmoved, your words fall upon deaf ears as a
focused, semi-ethereal water-based elemental

04:25:44.458 --> 04:25:52.250
entity is steady, his eyes filled with driven
command and murder. Anything else you want to do?

04:25:52.250 --> 04:25:53.776
SAM: Bonus action hide!

04:25:53.776 --> 04:25:54.903
LIAM: So he's thinking about it?

04:25:54.903 --> 04:25:55.884
MATT: He's thinking about it. Hmm?

04:25:55.884 --> 04:25:56.924
SAM: Bonus action hide!

04:25:56.924 --> 04:26:00.469
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and curl around there. Go
ahead and make your stealth check.

04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:04.137
SAM: With advantage. 22.

04:26:04.137 --> 04:26:07.422
MATT: 22, all right. You feel sufficiently hidden.
Beau.

04:26:07.422 --> 04:26:17.863
MARISHA: I'm going to Step of the Wind again, to
get up. (panting) Double my jump.

04:26:17.863 --> 04:26:22.118
MATT: (grunt, whoosh) There.

04:26:22.118 --> 04:26:26.420
MARISHA: Run, run, run as much as I can, more with
my bonus dash.

04:26:26.420 --> 04:26:30.735
MATT: Your bonus dash will get you a full jump.
You can get about there with your full movement

04:26:30.735 --> 04:26:32.304
with the half lost from the prone--

04:26:32.304 --> 04:26:33.454
MARISHA: And then move again.

04:26:33.454 --> 04:26:38.872
MATT: (counting) You're in the chamber now with
Fjord. As you round the corner, you see the one

04:26:38.872 --> 04:26:45.532
recently crushed dwarf; the other has this drowned
wraith pulled out of its body, this specter

04:26:45.532 --> 04:26:51.851
looming over Algar. And you see the back of Fjord
standing over Algar who's (panting) on the ground,

04:26:51.851 --> 04:26:53.351
scooting away.

04:26:53.351 --> 04:26:59.687
MARISHA: (out of breath) I made it! I'm here!
Okay. What do I-- Okay, I'm going to-- I go over

04:26:59.687 --> 04:27:07.801
to Algar and I do the MMA thing and I put my knee
right to his face and I pin him down.

04:27:07.801 --> 04:27:09.277
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah.

04:27:09.277 --> 04:27:13.932
MATT: Okay. He's now pinned against the wall, your
knee against the jaw and the chin; he's choking

04:27:13.932 --> 04:27:15.364
against the pressure.

04:27:15.364 --> 04:27:16.368
LAURA: Bracelet!

04:27:16.368 --> 04:27:19.257
MARISHA: And I'm going to just full-on grapple him
down and hold him for my action.

04:27:19.257 --> 04:27:20.297
LAURA: Pull his bracelet off!

04:27:20.297 --> 04:27:21.219
MATT: Make an athletics check.

04:27:21.219 --> 04:27:22.369
MARISHA: Oh oh! Oh, can I pull his bracelet off?

04:27:22.369 --> 04:27:23.223
MATT: Eh.

04:27:23.223 --> 04:27:24.800
SAM and MARISHA: (meta-gaming pigeon coos)

04:27:24.800 --> 04:27:26.030
MARISHA: Come on!

04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:28.545
MATT: You had to remember. Make an athletics
check.

04:27:28.545 --> 04:27:29.684
MARISHA: But it was in my head! But it <i>was</i> in my
head!

04:27:29.684 --> 04:27:30.685
MATT: Make an athletics check to grapple.

04:27:30.685 --> 04:27:35.604
MARISHA: Dammit! It was-- I thought about it
<i>five</i> minutes ago and I forgot-- that's good,

04:27:35.604 --> 04:27:41.115
though. That's good. 19!

04:27:41.115 --> 04:27:46.694
MATT: Yeah, he is fully grappled by you and shoved
against the wall. That ends your go.

04:27:46.694 --> 04:27:48.271
MARISHA: That ends my go.

04:27:48.271 --> 04:27:49.284
MATT: It is now--

04:27:49.284 --> 04:27:51.218
TRAVIS: You should just kill him because he's
never going to work again.

04:27:51.218 --> 04:27:52.698
MATT: Szundie's turn.

04:27:52.698 --> 04:27:55.282
TRAVIS: What is there to live for?

04:27:55.282 --> 04:27:56.735
MATT: Szundie...

04:27:56.735 --> 04:27:59.832
SAM: (singsong) Szundie, Szundie, Szundie.

04:27:59.832 --> 04:28:10.909
MATT: Yeah. It makes sense. Szundie's going to go
ahead and lower down and see the hobbling Caleb

04:28:10.909 --> 04:28:13.712
making his way up through the water, and
Caduceus--

04:28:13.712 --> 04:28:16.034
TALIESIN: I'm not up yet. I'm still in the water.
I haven't even started to get up yet.

04:28:16.034 --> 04:28:17.297
MATT: Still a five-foot line, though.

04:28:17.297 --> 04:28:18.512
TALIESIN: Okay. Even if I'm underwater?

04:28:18.512 --> 04:28:20.021
MATT: Yeah, you're still in the space.

04:28:20.021 --> 04:28:20.998
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay.

04:28:20.998 --> 04:28:26.968
MATT: It's not like a little tiny stream; it's a
big (splash). I need you both to make dexterity

04:28:26.968 --> 04:28:28.818
saving throws. Because you are prone--

04:28:28.818 --> 04:28:30.790
TALIESIN: I'm already prone.

04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:34.230
MATT: No, it doesn't affect your saving throw. So
yeah.

04:28:34.230 --> 04:28:36.002
SAM: No!

04:28:36.002 --> 04:28:37.084
LIAM: 19.

04:28:37.084 --> 04:28:38.163
MATT: 19, success!

04:28:38.163 --> 04:28:40.047
TALIESIN: Oh, 18!

04:28:40.047 --> 04:28:44.035
MATT: Success! So that is-- ooh, that's a good
roll.

04:28:44.035 --> 04:28:45.123
LIAM: Half of a lot.

04:28:45.123 --> 04:28:46.130
MATT: That's...

04:28:46.130 --> 04:28:49.055
TRAVIS: "Ooh, that's a good roll." Not what you
want to hear.

04:28:49.055 --> 04:28:52.416
MATT: 24. So that's 12 points of bludgeoning
damage to each of you.

04:28:52.416 --> 04:28:53.609
LIAM: Caleb's out.

04:28:53.609 --> 04:28:54.771
SAM: Oh, no.

04:28:54.771 --> 04:28:59.872
MATT: Caleb goes out and gets pushed 20 feet back
again (boosh) "Whoa!" way into the back there.

04:28:59.872 --> 04:29:07.022
Caduceus is like "Argh!" But you're still holding
on at this moment. And it is going to go ahead and

04:29:07.022 --> 04:29:14.793
appear right next to you, holding this trident,
now that apparates in its hand, and it's rearing

04:29:14.793 --> 04:29:16.383
back to go ahead and start.

04:29:16.383 --> 04:29:17.788
LAURA: (screams)

04:29:17.788 --> 04:29:21.342
MATT: All right. Caduceus. You're conscious.

04:29:21.342 --> 04:29:29.987
TALIESIN: Okay. The first I'm going to do is
stuff. Sorry, I'm just getting my shit together.

04:29:29.987 --> 04:29:48.242
I'm going to do... I'm going to, for an action
even before I get up, I'm just going to cast Cure

04:29:48.242 --> 04:29:51.154
Wounds at a second level on Caleb, if I can
just--

04:29:51.154 --> 04:29:52.327
MATT: Cure Wounds is a touch, I believe.

04:29:52.327 --> 04:29:55.256
TALIESIN: Is it a touch? Oh yeah, it is. Do I have
a distance one? No, I do not.

04:29:55.256 --> 04:29:56.348
MATT: Healing Word is the--

04:29:56.348 --> 04:29:57.434
TALIESIN: I do! I'll do Healing Word.

04:29:57.434 --> 04:29:58.482
MARISHA: Healing Word is the best!

04:29:58.482 --> 04:30:00.207
TALIESIN: I'll do Healing Word at a second level.

04:30:00.207 --> 04:30:02.287
MATT: All right, 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier.

04:30:02.287 --> 04:30:07.755
TALIESIN: It autofills, so that's 13 points of
health to you right now.

04:30:07.755 --> 04:30:09.119
MATT: That's right! Grave clerics, man.

04:30:09.119 --> 04:30:10.106
LAURA: Nice!

04:30:10.106 --> 04:30:14.652
LIAM: (laughs) Oh my god! (coughs)

04:30:14.652 --> 04:30:23.292
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn invisible as my bonus
action, and I'm going to get up and start moving

04:30:23.292 --> 04:30:24.843
away from this mess.

04:30:24.843 --> 04:30:26.208
MATT: All right.

04:30:26.208 --> 04:30:27.507
TALIESIN: I will just be visible my next turn.

04:30:27.507 --> 04:30:35.035
MATT: All right. So we'll say for purposes of this
right now, you get up, turn invisible--

04:30:35.035 --> 04:30:37.004
TALIESIN: I was going to turn invisible before I
get up, but yeah.

04:30:37.004 --> 04:30:43.666
MATT: Okay, yeah. You turn invisible, get up, and
then you want to move--? You can move two squares,

04:30:43.666 --> 04:30:44.703
we'll say.

04:30:44.703 --> 04:30:46.027
TALIESIN: There. There, yeah, that'll do.

04:30:46.027 --> 04:30:47.769
LIAM: The water's going (splash splash).

04:30:47.769 --> 04:30:50.975
TALIESIN: Yep. But there's a lot happening. It's
just a (splash) everything's like that.

04:30:50.975 --> 04:30:52.147
MATT: Fjord.

04:30:52.147 --> 04:30:58.138
TRAVIS: I look down at Algar and say, I'm only
going to say this once. Unless you want to end up

04:30:58.138 --> 04:31:00.988
like your friend here, I'm going to need that
bracelet.

04:31:00.988 --> 04:31:09.150
MATT: He's like (choking sounds). He can't do
anything. But you can see the bracelet right there

04:31:09.150 --> 04:31:10.406
on his wrist--

04:31:10.406 --> 04:31:12.558
TRAVIS: I'm going to cut his hand off and take the
bracelet.

04:31:12.558 --> 04:31:13.655
LAURA: Don't cut his hand, just take the
bracelet!

04:31:13.655 --> 04:31:14.733
TRAVIS: No, I'll take the bracelet off.

04:31:14.733 --> 04:31:15.782
MATT: What do you want to do?

04:31:15.782 --> 04:31:16.765
LIAM: Yeah, what do <i>you</i> want to do?

04:31:16.765 --> 04:31:17.553
SAM: (coos)

04:31:17.553 --> 04:31:18.647
TRAVIS: I'm going to cut his hand off!

04:31:18.647 --> 04:31:19.825
(cheers)

04:31:19.825 --> 04:31:24.442
MATT: With being grappled, <i>coup de grace,</i> just
go ahead and roll an attack just for the hell of

04:31:24.442 --> 04:31:25.931
it. With advantage.

04:31:25.931 --> 04:31:30.233
TRAVIS: With advantage? This will be fine. 17--
that's even better. 21.

04:31:30.233 --> 04:31:38.302
MATT: With a sparking, grinding noise, you all
hear echoes as the blade carves across the stones

04:31:38.302 --> 04:31:42.908
and you watch as a splash of water, it looks
almost like a water razor, just (slash) through

04:31:42.908 --> 04:31:47.650
the area and the hand just falls off onto the
ground. The bracelet slips off of his wrist, and

04:31:47.650 --> 04:31:51.835
he's (muffled screams) and is now screaming
against the guttural pressure placed on his

04:31:51.835 --> 04:32:01.500
throat. In that moment, you watch as Szundie-- the
trident goes limp, disappears from his hand. Just

04:32:01.500 --> 04:32:08.775
gives you a look, turns around and then begins to
drift up in the direction of where Algar is. And

04:32:08.775 --> 04:32:09.926
that's where we're going to end tonight's
episode.

04:32:09.926 --> 04:32:12.438
LIAM: Oh shit!

04:32:12.438 --> 04:32:14.274
TRAVIS: Drift up towards us?

04:32:14.274 --> 04:32:15.924
MATT: Yep.

04:32:15.924 --> 04:32:18.124
MARISHA: What does he want to say?

04:32:18.124 --> 04:32:20.151
MATT: We'll find out next week.

04:32:20.151 --> 04:32:21.984
LAURA: Maybe he's coming to thank you! Maybe!

04:32:21.984 --> 04:32:30.494
MATT: It seems that somehow you've freed this
entity, whatever that means. We'll find out next week.

04:32:30.494 --> 04:32:32.190
LAURA: That means that the city's going to be
without electricity.

04:32:32.190 --> 04:32:35.650
TRAVIS: Not if I put that fucking slap bracelet
on!

04:32:35.650 --> 04:32:37.433
LAURA: If you put-- oh, fuck.

04:32:37.433 --> 04:32:38.790
MARISHA: Is that going to be you? You going to do
that?

04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:41.455
MATT: So. We'll find out next week.

04:32:41.455 --> 04:32:49.077
MARISHA: Fjord MVP! Fjord! Yes! Yeah, you killed
it this week!

04:32:49.077 --> 04:32:51.575
TALIESIN: That was <i>so</i> stressful!

04:32:51.575 --> 04:32:52.897
SAM: Ashley, you coming back next week?

04:32:52.897 --> 04:32:54.193
ASHLEY: No.

04:32:54.193 --> 04:32:55.456
(groans)

04:32:55.456 --> 04:32:57.895
SAM: Was she ever there, guys?

04:32:57.895 --> 04:33:03.468
MATT: Yasha will still be there. We're hoping
Ashley can Skype in as much as she can, and I'll

04:33:03.468 --> 04:33:05.112
be NPC-ing Yasha in the interim.

04:33:05.112 --> 04:33:06.865
LAURA: Muscle girls!

04:33:06.865 --> 04:33:13.312
MATT: Thank you guys for hanging with us. We ran a
little long tonight. Ran a little long tonight,

04:33:13.312 --> 04:33:15.439
but I wanted to get as much gameplay in with
Ashley as possible.

04:33:15.439 --> 04:33:17.636
MARISHA: That was a great game!

04:33:17.636 --> 04:33:19.439
TALIESIN: Never too much Ashley.

04:33:19.439 --> 04:33:25.447
MATT: Yeah, well done, guys. Well done! So, on
that note, let's say a big thank you to you guys

04:33:25.447 --> 04:33:29.219
for your patience, a big thank you to our
fantastic sponsors for tonight: D&D Beyond and the

04:33:29.219 --> 04:33:35.368
Rook and the Raven, their awesome Kickstarter. We
love you guys, we'll see you next week, and is it

04:33:35.368 --> 04:33:37.019
Thursday yet? Good night.

04:33:37.019 --> 04:45:20.461
[music]
