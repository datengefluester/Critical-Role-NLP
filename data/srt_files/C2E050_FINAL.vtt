NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.452
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:05.535
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:07.398
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:07.483 --> 00:00:12.615
MATT: Nice try. Before we jump into tonight's
game, we have some quick announcements to get

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:17.278
through. First and foremost, we have our fantastic
returning sponsor, for the second year now with

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:19.487
this campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:00:19.487 --> 00:00:21.242
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:28.205
SAM: Hi! (clears throat) Little tickle in my
throat, sorry. Hi guys! As you all know, I am a

00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:32.088
bit of an amateur inventor. This is no news
to you guys.

00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:33.626
TRAVIS: That's total news.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:41.493
SAM: Some of my most notable inventions have been
the pet hot air balloon, the smell-over-Skype

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:48.114
plugin, and of course the Nintendo Virtual Boy.
But this new one I invented for our friends at D&amp;D

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:52.226
Beyond. It's an invention that I made--

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:54.892
LAURA: Oh god.

00:00:54.892 --> 00:01:03.408
SAM: I call it the D&amp;D Beyond Merciri. It's all
the organizational power of D&amp;D Beyond in a

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:09.905
tricked-out smart speaker, with a helpful voice
that some of you might recognize. I'll demonstrate

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:17.634
it for you right now, guys, okay? Merciri, what's
the best way to organize your D&amp;D characters and campaigns?

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.824
MATT: (VO as Merciri) "That's simple. It's D&amp;D
Beyond."

00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:28.996
SAM: Hey, see, it works! Merciri, tell me about
the halfling race.

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:33.568
MATT: "Standing three feet tall, halflings are
adept at hiding, avoiding conflict, and have

00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:39.063
remarkable luck. They are a typically happy race,
sort of the opposite of goblins. Ew, goblins.

00:01:39.063 --> 00:01:41.442
Goblins are super gross. Seriously."

00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:50.999
SAM: Okay, Merciri, cancel. Merciri, who's the
best player on Critical Role?

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.756
MATT: "Accessing data. The answer is Travis
Willingham."

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.425
TRAVIS: (triumphant yelling)

00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:04.221
SAM: Okay. That's fine. Merciri, who's the
<i>smartest</i> player on Critical Role?

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:07.813
MATT: "Taliesin Jaffe. He has 4000 years of
knowledge."

00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:14.056
SAM: That's true, that is true. Okay, fine.
Merciri, who are the top three cast members on

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:16.510
Critical Role by popularity?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.582
MATT: "Number one, Travis Willingham. Number two,
a tie between Marisha Ray, Laura Bailey, Ashley

00:02:21.582 --> 00:02:27.248
Johnson, Liam O'Brien, Taliesin Jaffe, and Matthew
Mercer. Number three, Maxwell James."

00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:31.397
(laughter)

00:02:31.397 --> 00:02:40.111
SAM: Okay, he's not in the cast. There's some
bugs. Fine, Merciri, could you please list the

00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:47.889
most handsome <i>male</i> cast members, with a beard,
who are not Taliesin, Liam, or Sam?

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.426
MATT: "Wil Wheaton, Khary Payton--"

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:56.316
SAM: Fuck you. Wait, can you do that list one more
time, Merciri?

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:59.772
MATT: "Wil Wheaton, Khary Payton, Will Friedle,
Marisha Ray."

00:02:59.772 --> 00:03:03.416
SAM: Yeah, so she doesn't even have a beard,
Merciri.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:07.104
MATT: "It doesn't matter. She's an amazing,
talented woman and she should be on every list."

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:12.353
SAM: That's true. Okay. Merciri, roll a d20 for
me.

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:13.643
MATT: "You rolled a one."

00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:15.244
LAURA: Aww.

00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:17.178
SAM: Merciri, roll another d20 for me.

00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:18.532
MATT: "You rolled a one."

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.349
SAM: Fuck you.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:23.607
MARISHA: Merciri, roll a d20.

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:25.157
MATT: "You rolled a natural 20."

00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:27.299
SAM: Oh my fucking god!

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.376
TRAVIS: Burn it down!

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:35.823
SAM: Well, I guess it's back to the drawing board,
guys. Let's wrap this up: Merciri, could you tell

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:39.500
the people where they can find D&amp;D Beyond?

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.554
MATT: "Just visit dndbeyond.com, or, if you don't
have a computer, just tweet your D&amp;D-related

00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:49.512
question directly to Matthew Mercer's Twitter
account. He promises to respond to you

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:50.949
within three hours."

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.858
SAM: Okay, thank you. Thank you, guys. Look for
this in stores soon.

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:57.921
LAURA: Fabulous.

00:03:57.921 --> 00:03:59.425
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:01.198
SAM: And thank you, Merciri.

00:04:01.198 --> 00:04:03.916
LAURA: That sounded just like Matt! That is so
weird.

00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:07.341
SAM: It did! I'm a good inventor!

00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:09.932
MARISHA: Is this because of the Facetime error?

00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:12.440
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.766
LIAM: Splice it all together.

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:19.539
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, our friends
at D&amp;D Beyond. We kicked off our second season of

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:26.119
Between the Sheets this past week with our
fantastic friend Logic, Bobby. It was a great

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:32.539
interview. You can check out the VOD at
youtube.com/criticalrole, and we'll be chatting

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:39.135
next monday with Quyen Tran, which is our
wonderful Sam Riegel's wife. The amazing,

00:04:39.135 --> 00:04:45.775
accomplished director of photography for all of
television and film, and a genuine badass. You'll

00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:49.941
watch it and be like, "Sam?" And you know what?
He'll agree.

00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:53.751
(laughter)

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.061
TRAVIS: True.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:59.076
MATT: But yeah, so check it out. It's 7:00pm
Pacific Time at twitch.tv/criticalrole.

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:05.405
SAM: I'll be in the chat saying, "I know, right?"
The whole time.

00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:08.618
MATT: Laura, you have some merch updates, I
believe.

00:05:08.618 --> 00:05:15.778
LAURA: Oh, do I! You guys may have noticed, right
here, on one Sam Riegel, the beautiful Whispered

00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:17.633
One-- ooh, look at those pecs!

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:19.697
SAM: I'll do the Travis thing, ready?

00:05:19.697 --> 00:05:22.508
LAURA: I think the shirt enhances them.

00:05:22.508 --> 00:05:25.508
LIAM: The nose hole is right in his sternum!

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:30.054
LAURA: Ooh, beep-beep-beep. This is designed by
Lauryn Ipsum, who also designed the cover on the

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:35.535
artbook, if you might have noticed. That's in the
store right now. I mean, is it in the store right

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:40.826
now? Hold on, it might just be preorder. It's in
the store right now! You guys, in the UK, it's

00:05:40.826 --> 00:05:46.537
going to the UK on February 21st, I think, or the
end of February, something like that. Speaking of

00:05:46.537 --> 00:05:53.257
February 21st, the other thing I need to tell you
about is our art prints that are on pre-order

00:05:53.257 --> 00:05:55.582
right now. Can we bring out Vox Machina?

00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:57.002
SAM: No, we have them here?

00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:58.467
MARISHA: Bring them out!

00:05:58.467 --> 00:05:59.927
LAURA: This is our beautiful--

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:00.811
SAM: Whoa!

00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:02.179
LAURA: I know!

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:04.050
SAM: It's bigger than everyone.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:12.144
LAURA: These were designed by Matteo Scalera and
Moreno Dinisio, and they're phenomenal.

00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:13.391
SAM: Is there another one?

00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:15.050
LAURA: Yeah, well, there's also--

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.098
SAM: Oh shit!

00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:17.473
LAURA: Wait for it.

00:06:17.473 --> 00:06:23.396
TRAVIS: Be careful with it, don't rush it! Don't
rush it, it's too nice!

00:06:23.396 --> 00:06:25.744
LAURA: No, but this one is super unique.

00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:28.850
SAM: We're taking this one to Kinko's later
to make copies.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:35.963
LAURA: Yeah. (gasps) The Mighty Nein! You can
order these for pre-order in these kind, and also

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:42.467
signed versions are available as well. Those are
being on pre-order until February 21st at

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:47.787
midnight, 11:59pm Pacific Time, that's our time.

00:06:47.787 --> 00:06:50.765
LIAM: Matteo is a mad genius.

00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:52.662
SAM: He's really good.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:59.684
LAURA: I mean, they're gorgeous. These are on
really nice art paper. You guys may remember our

00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:05.472
David Mack art prints that we did. It's similar
paper. It's actually even nicer paper than it was before.

00:07:05.602 --> 00:07:07.787
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not slicky poster paper;
it's--

00:07:07.787 --> 00:07:15.591
LAURA: Badass. Yeah. I love you, and that's what's
available in the store. As well as other things,

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:16.478
you know.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.114
TRAVIS: Can we get copies of that after the show?

00:07:19.114 --> 00:07:24.694
LAURA: Maybe. Oh, and, you know, you can go to our
US shop at shop.critrole.com, and our UK shop,

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:31.233
shop.critrole.co.uk. Dot...nothing else, that's
it.

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:37.974
MATT: Thank you, Laura. Final announcements
tonight. This is an important final announcement:

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:42.356
we're actually taking a week off from Critical
Role next Thursday, February 7th, and Talks

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:48.683
Machina will also go dark that Tuesday, February
12th. We'll be back on Thursday, February 14th at

00:07:48.683 --> 00:07:55.755
7:00pm Pacific with Critical Role, so we'll see
you guys then. I believe that's it and all, as far

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:58.728
as the announcements are concerned.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.599
TRAVIS: No! Not ready!

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:06.823
MATT: That being the case, it's time to jump in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:11.430
[water bubbling]

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.528
[thunder]

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.582
[explosion]

00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:22.806
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:30.679
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:39.987
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:47.701
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:51.942
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:08:56.183 --> 00:09:01.386
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:09.123
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:12.726
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:19.632
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:09:21.476 --> 00:09:26.347
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:09:26.347 --> 00:09:36.308
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:44.848
[fire burning]

00:09:44.848 --> 00:09:46.475
MATT: And welcome back.

00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:49.225
(laughter)

00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:55.952
SAM: I love it when you abandon it halfway through
the word.

00:09:55.952 --> 00:10:02.875
TRAVIS: The laziest bail! Wow.

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:05.858
MATT: I salute you, Laura Bailey.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:10.429
MARISHA: Not even ten seconds.

00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:13.380
TRAVIS: Crash and burn.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:23.608
MATT: So, last we left off, the Mighty Nein had found
their way back from the Menagerie Coast to check

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:30.469
in with some friends and the general chaos
brewing, based on the conflict between the empire

00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:39.065
and the Kryn Dynasty. Upon traveling, making your
way towards the city of Felderwin, a city involved

00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:47.367
with Nott's history, you discovered that this
apothecary that had burned to the ground belonged

00:10:47.367 --> 00:10:54.650
to a male halfling, who has now gone missing, and
discovered that Nott had a little boy.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.927
After learning about Nott's history, learned more
than that. You learned that Nott at one point was

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:11.760
indeed a halfling. Through a vengeful plot by the
goblins that stalk the southeastern regions of the

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.172
empire's Marrow Valley, she managed to help her
family escape, but was drowned and then

00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:22.734
reincarnated by some sort of a hooded power figure
that had an alliance with these goblins, it

00:11:22.734 --> 00:11:28.479
seemed. Brought back as a goblin and has been
living as such for the better part of two years now.

00:11:29.907 --> 00:11:37.330
Upon asking around the city and getting some
information, you discovered that the husband of

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:45.574
Nott, or Veth, if you will, has been apparently
taken by the Kryn, and had some involvement with

00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:52.505
his alchemical studies with the Cerberus Assembly
and this study of dunamis. You acquired a few

00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:57.576
objects from a subterranean basement laboratory
that was mostly trashed, apparently in the razing

00:11:57.576 --> 00:11:59.528
of the city.

00:11:59.528 --> 00:12:05.730
You then decided to go and inspect the tunnels
where these Kryn emerged from. One of them

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:13.537
apparently was still somewhat intact. Deciding to
not be balked by a sheer wall of stone and rock,

00:12:14.241 --> 00:12:21.339
Jester proceeded to twice Polymorph herself into a
dire honey badger and burrow her way through

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:29.640
hundreds and hundreds of feet of rock, emerging on
the rest of this uncollapsed burrowed tunnel of a

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.977
large worm creature they had used to attack,
without warning, the city of Felderwin.

00:12:34.977 --> 00:12:41.541
As you, the Mighty Nein, had made your way beyond
that boundary and began to step into this

00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:48.722
subterranean cavern system, stalking and seeking
the path that these individuals took here, beneath

00:12:48.722 --> 00:12:57.928
the surface, we begin tonight's game. First off,
how would you like to prepare? What is your

00:12:57.928 --> 00:13:05.108
marching order? Let me know what your plan is now,
going in to the sheer, dark underground beneath

00:13:05.108 --> 00:13:06.044
the Marrow Valley.

00:13:06.044 --> 00:13:10.137
TRAVIS: I love it when you can hear the DM's
frustration in the retelling of the story.

00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:12.618
LAURA: Going, like, you guys are being really
stupid.

00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:13.677
MATT: Not frustration.

00:13:13.677 --> 00:13:14.563
TRAVIS: No!

00:13:14.563 --> 00:13:19.314
TALIESIN: I would like to know which one of you is
hitting the rotating knives first, is what he is--

00:13:19.404 --> 00:13:20.909
MATT: They're not knives.

00:13:20.909 --> 00:13:24.870
LAURA: Maybe it's not the smartest idea for us to
do this, is all.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.438
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe we should just leave. What do
you think? Pack up and go.

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:30.760
SAM: But my husband.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.847
TRAVIS: Mm.

00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:37.090
SAM: We spent three months searching for your backstory.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.154
(laughter)

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.064
TRAVIS: I'm good. Y'know.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.634
It was only a joke, Nott, sorry.
Terrible timing. We should push on.

00:13:51.634 --> 00:14:02.301
SAM: I hear in Xhorhas, they have a captain there
who has lots of eyeballs that you can ingest into

00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:03.630
your body.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.429
TRAVIS: Really?

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:05.227
SAM: Yes.

00:14:05.227 --> 00:14:06.424
TRAVIS: Lots of eyeballs?

00:14:06.424 --> 00:14:09.232
SAM: Lots of golden eyeballs that you can put in
your belly.

00:14:09.252 --> 00:14:12.839
TRAVIS: Sounds like a magic place. This fucker.

00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:17.967
TALIESIN: I just figured that out, okay. Not even
kidding.

00:14:19.377 --> 00:14:22.065
SAM: All right, what are we preparing?

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:28.418
MATT: Well, first off, a marching order. These
tunnels here can range between brief bits of

00:14:28.418 --> 00:14:36.087
cavern and open chambers to following this carved
worm tunnel, which is about ten feet wide and is

00:14:36.087 --> 00:14:40.467
cylindrical. You can have at most two people
shoulder-to-shoulder going through each place. I

00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:44.841
would like to know, for the majority of this
journey-- and tell me when you want to change it

00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:48.835
up at any point-- I want to know what your
marching order is, traveling through here.

00:14:48.835 --> 00:14:52.123
TRAVIS: Who has the best darkvision, I would
imagine. We should have--

00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:54.215
MARISHA: I have put on my goggles, for sure.

00:14:54.215 --> 00:14:55.074
TRAVIS: I have 60.

00:14:55.074 --> 00:14:56.268
LAURA: I have 60 as well.

00:14:56.268 --> 00:14:58.225
SAM: Me too, but I'm not very perceptive.

00:14:58.225 --> 00:15:00.463
LAURA: I am decently perceptive; how about you?

00:15:00.463 --> 00:15:03.225
TALIESIN: I'm very perceptive, but I can't see in
the dark.

00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:04.747
LAURA: Oh, no! Really, Caduceus?

00:15:04.747 --> 00:15:07.313
TRAVIS: The two clerics do not go
shoulder-to-shoulder.

00:15:07.313 --> 00:15:10.262
TALIESIN: No, we should probably keep a little bit
of distance.

00:15:10.262 --> 00:15:12.594
LAURA: I'll stay next to you, Fjord, in the
front.

00:15:12.604 --> 00:15:17.255
MARISHA: Can octopuses see in the dark? If you do
the facemask thing?

00:15:17.255 --> 00:15:25.623
LIAM: That's not happening here. He is a cat. No,
but I have this rag over one of my-- it's dim, but

00:15:25.623 --> 00:15:28.112
maybe you and I can stand near the middle.

00:15:28.112 --> 00:15:30.062
TALIESIN: I'll stick with you. All right.

00:15:30.142 --> 00:15:32.665
MATT: We have Caleb and Caduceus towards the
center.

00:15:33.312 --> 00:15:35.338
MARISHA: I guess I'll go up front.

00:15:35.338 --> 00:15:40.189
TRAVIS: Well, you got shitty darkvision. Oh, but
you got the goggles. And who are you with? Nott?

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:42.210
MARISHA: No one's called a partner yet.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.612
SAM: I'll go with you.

00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:47.669
TALIESIN: Also we should probably have Yasha up
front as well.

00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:49.000
LAURA: Good call.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.359
TRAVIS: Darkvision for Yasha--

00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:54.349
TALIESIN: Probably not.

00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:55.588
MATT: Go look.

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:56.569
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

00:15:56.569 --> 00:16:03.665
MATT: There you go. Yasha and Beau at the front.
Behind that, Caleb and Caduceus. Who's behind them?

00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:07.491
LAURA: I think it was going to be me and Fjord at
the front. Are you perceptive?

00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:09.752
TRAVIS: Decent.

00:16:09.752 --> 00:16:15.053
MATT: So Fjord and Jester at the front. Then,
Nott, you're taking the back?

00:16:15.053 --> 00:16:18.300
SAM: I'm with Marisha-- I mean Beau. Wherever
she is.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.632
MATT: So then where's Yasha?

00:16:19.642 --> 00:16:21.189
LAURA: Yasha can be at the back.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.001
SAM: Yasha's in the back. Sorry, Matt.

00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:25.904
MATT: Don't apologize. It's okay, we're figuring
this out.

00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:29.170
LAURA: Will Nugget fit by Yasha?

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.261
MATT: Okay, yeah, if you would like to have taken
your--

00:16:32.261 --> 00:16:34.942
LAURA: Where else will I put him, you know?

00:16:34.942 --> 00:16:39.293
TRAVIS: I don't know, maybe outside of the tunnel?
Back at the place where we were?

00:16:39.293 --> 00:16:40.891
LAURA: Where would they stay?

00:16:40.891 --> 00:16:46.461
MATT: I don't have the mini on me at the moment.
I can do that at the break. However, as you've

00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:57.301
worked out your grouping, traveling through these
tunnels, you go on for an hour, two hours.

00:16:57.301 --> 00:17:01.892
Those at the front, which would be you two, I'd
like you both to make a perception check, please.

00:17:01.892 --> 00:17:03.632
TRAVIS: I will give you advantage.

00:17:03.632 --> 00:17:04.735
MATT: So you're helping.

00:17:04.735 --> 00:17:05.852
TRAVIS: Helping, yeah.

00:17:05.852 --> 00:17:07.774
LAURA: Okey dokey.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:15.618
That would be 19.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:24.586
MATT: Keeping a watch as you guys progress, the
faint perpetual decline goes deeper and deeper

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:29.947
beneath the earth. The rushing sounds of the
underground river that seems to be walking

00:17:29.947 --> 00:17:36.518
alongside this passageway slowly fades as you see
the river now pass beneath stone, the cavern come

00:17:36.518 --> 00:17:42.195
to an end, and the entrance of the next portion of
the tunnel where the worm creature had to burrow

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:51.174
into this chamber. There are natural pockets of
cavernous areas here, but a lot of them aren't

00:17:51.174 --> 00:17:57.137
connected except for by this particular burrowed
tunnel. So that's probably going to be the path

00:17:57.137 --> 00:18:00.686
you're going to be looking for
wherever you're traveling.

00:18:00.686 --> 00:18:10.287
LAURA: Okay. I have a question, you guys. I've got
this super-secret dodecahedron thingy in my bag

00:18:10.287 --> 00:18:15.912
that Yussa specifically said that we should not be
bringing near anything and stuff, and now we're

00:18:15.912 --> 00:18:18.888
taking it right to the source. Do you think
that's a bad idea?

00:18:18.888 --> 00:18:23.096
TRAVIS: Well, as a bit of clarification, I think
we weren't supposed to <i>use</i> it, right?

00:18:23.096 --> 00:18:27.436
Anything that would activate it and send off
energy. I think as long as it's in the other

00:18:27.436 --> 00:18:30.940
dimension that is her bag, it's okay, right?

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.866
LAURA: Right, unless they capture me and flip my
bag inside out, and then they have it, yeah.

00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:40.836
TALIESIN: It would still be in a big metal case
until they really went through.

00:18:40.836 --> 00:18:46.357
LIAM: Yeah, but we need to weigh the risks
we are facing, and Nott's husband.

00:18:46.357 --> 00:18:49.131
SAM: Where would we put it otherwise?

00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:50.336
LAURA: I don't know.

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:55.257
LIAM: There are also people behind us
topside who'd kill us for this, as well.

00:18:55.727 --> 00:18:59.112
SAM: Where's the tripod and stuff right now?

00:18:59.284 --> 00:19:02.294
LAURA: It's in my bag as well. I've got
the whole setup going.

00:19:02.294 --> 00:19:07.201
TRAVIS: You've got the gun and the clip.
The only way they're going to grab it and

00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:11.035
turn it out is if most of us are dead, right?

00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:16.114
LAURA: Right, and we're only fighting
an entire army of soldiers, so it probably

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.381
won't happen that we will die.

00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:21.649
SAM: We don't know that. It might be
very nice there.

00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:25.388
LAURA: That's true. Yasha, you think
it'll be nice?

00:19:25.388 --> 00:19:34.497
MATT: Yasha stares ahead for a moment and goes,
"Having been to places like the coast,

00:19:34.497 --> 00:19:37.102
"it's not very nice."

00:19:40.632 --> 00:19:44.678
SAM: Let's just make sure you don't get captured
and your bag doesn't get grabbed.

00:19:44.678 --> 00:19:46.879
TALIESIN: No harm in focusing on the positive.

00:19:46.879 --> 00:19:47.979
TRAVIS: That's right.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.278
TALIESIN: Nothing we can do about it.

00:19:50.278 --> 00:19:53.427
MARISHA: So we're going to come to a
conclusion later, maybe?

00:19:53.427 --> 00:19:56.045
SAM: We're just looking on the bright side
of things.

00:19:56.045 --> 00:19:59.213
TALIESIN: We can't make a plan until we
know what we're up against.

00:19:59.213 --> 00:20:01.383
LAURA: That's true.

00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:05.645
LIAM: If we are lucky, we will overtake
them before we return to their home.

00:20:05.645 --> 00:20:09.300
TALIESIN: And if they're too much, then we'll
just get what information we can, maybe

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:16.385
sneak in while they're sleeping, and scurry out
with what we need with no harm, no problem.

00:20:16.385 --> 00:20:19.899
MARISHA: I have no idea what we're talking about.

00:20:21.004 --> 00:20:22.615
TRAVIS: Let's push forward.

00:20:22.615 --> 00:20:26.863
LAURA: What's in this pocket o' cavern? Anything
cool?

00:20:26.863 --> 00:20:32.037
MATT: Rolling your perception, you don't see
anything aside from the natural formations.

00:20:32.037 --> 00:20:37.519
There's the smell of hard water and wet earth that
permeates the entirety of this chamber, and

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:46.839
continuing on for quite some time. The natural
chambers and pathways here are chained together by

00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:51.857
these tunnels, but within them, it doesn't look,
from anything you've seen so far is lived in. You

00:20:51.857 --> 00:20:58.379
don't see signs of any other creatures making
homes or nests. You do see bits of quartz-like

00:20:58.379 --> 00:21:02.437
crystal forming from gathered minerals over time.

00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:05.046
TALIESIN: I really like it.

00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:06.640
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:13.938
MATT: A series of stalactites and stalagmites that
find their way through the-- see? Thank you guys,

00:21:13.938 --> 00:21:15.138
for your help.

00:21:15.138 --> 00:21:16.371
LAURA: T. Top.

00:21:16.371 --> 00:21:24.008
MATT: Yes. Just keep giving me suggestions. Really
figured it out. It's not condescending at all.

00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:30.246
LAURA: Are there footprints on the ground?

00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:32.116
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:33.929
TALIESIN: We did find some earlier.

00:21:33.929 --> 00:21:35.528
MATT: Yeah, the previous tunnel.

00:21:37.788 --> 00:21:38.966
LAURA: 15?

00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:47.017
MATT: Yeah, based on looking at the ground here,
which is mostly packed dirt and general loose

00:21:47.017 --> 00:21:51.641
pieces of pebbles, and things that were pushed and
ground around by the creature that made its way

00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:57.858
through the area. In its wake you can see familiar
footfalls, similar to the shape that you'd

00:21:57.858 --> 00:22:02.231
previously seen that didn't match the rest of the
crownsguard and/or the Righteous Brand that

00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:08.843
existed in the vicinity of Felderwin. You do
notice the trail, the tracks, of the Kryn warriors

00:22:08.843 --> 00:22:14.527
that had exited, and it does lead and follow the
burrowing path of the worm.

00:22:15.032 --> 00:22:21.505
LAURA: How big of a trail is the worm thing? Is it
like this? Is it like this?

00:22:21.505 --> 00:22:24.327
MATT: It's about ten feet wide. Eight to ten feet
wide.

00:22:24.327 --> 00:22:34.849
LAURA: Cool! So we're fighting these guys and a
giant worm creature that is ten feet in width, so

00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:38.211
he's probably kind of long.

00:22:38.747 --> 00:22:42.981
TRAVIS: Probably. And we've got lots of room to
maneuver in these caverns.

00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:46.706
SAM: Are you scared?

00:22:46.706 --> 00:22:51.503
LAURA: I mean, I'm not going to lie, Nott. I am a
little bit nervous.

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:58.293
MARISHA: I think I would be a little more
confident if we had a vague idea of a plan? Don't

00:22:58.293 --> 00:23:07.749
get me wrong, super down to fly by the seat of my
pants. That type of girl. But sneaking in, killing

00:23:07.749 --> 00:23:14.529
people in the middle of the night, two armies,
fight, getting captured-- these all sound like

00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:18.026
real big stories.

00:23:18.331 --> 00:23:22.791
LIAM: I have a question for you, Jester. You know
how you have just turned yourself into the

00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:24.517
oversized honey badger?

00:23:24.517 --> 00:23:25.598
LAURA: Yeah.

00:23:25.598 --> 00:23:30.568
LIAM: Could you do that to a giant worm, but, say,
turn it into a cow?

00:23:30.568 --> 00:23:35.807
LAURA: Well, yeah, remember what I did to-- Oh you
weren't-- Remember when I turned that dragon into

00:23:35.807 --> 00:23:40.672
that little thing? That's what I could do to a
worm, I guess. I did that to the dragon before you

00:23:40.672 --> 00:23:43.418
came in, you know, when we almost died.

00:23:43.418 --> 00:23:53.336
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. Rather than trying to whack away at a
gigantic worm, maybe you just make it harmless,

00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:56.672
but not so little that it loses its new form.

00:23:56.672 --> 00:23:57.716
LAURA: Good call.

00:23:57.716 --> 00:23:59.295
TALIESIN: Like a goat, maybe.

00:23:59.295 --> 00:24:00.511
LIAM: Yeah, a goat.

00:24:00.511 --> 00:24:07.886
LAURA: Yeah. Or something maybe like a sparrow or
something, so it will fly away.

00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:12.041
MARISHA: I like that better. Goats are weird.
Square pupils.

00:24:12.041 --> 00:24:14.537
SAM: Or a firefly. We could catch it in a jar.

00:24:14.537 --> 00:24:20.909
LIAM: I think something small is likely to get
smacked and taken out of its newer form. It would

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:24.173
need to be something that could take a bit of
punishment.

00:24:24.173 --> 00:24:27.074
LAURA: Like a dire honey badger.

00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:31.245
LIAM: Like that. Or a cow.

00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:35.281
SAM: See? Look, Beau, we have a plan.

00:24:35.281 --> 00:24:36.688
MARISHA: Encounter worm--

00:24:36.688 --> 00:24:38.406
SAM and MARISHA: Turn into a cow.

00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:40.560
SAM: Profit.

00:24:41.199 --> 00:24:44.810
TRAVIS: You know, dire honey badgers got claws and
stuff. Maybe a dire sheep.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.340
LAURA: Ooh, that's good, I like that, Fjord.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.340
TRAVIS: Yeah, anyway.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.577
MARISHA: I think they still have square pupils.

00:24:50.577 --> 00:24:53.054
TRAVIS: It'll hit you in the moment. I got a
feeling.

00:24:53.054 --> 00:24:54.359
TALIESIN: Is that true?

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:58.914
LAURA: Also, though, I can't do that until we
sleep, but I don't think we're going to run into

00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:04.499
them today, right? Because they're probably really
far ahead of us, because they got a two week lead?

00:25:04.499 --> 00:25:05.450
TRAVIS: Totally.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.638
TALIESIN: Stop laughing, DM. That's not funny.

00:25:07.638 --> 00:25:09.374
MATT: No, roll a nature check.

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:11.106
TRAVIS: What are you rolling for?

00:25:11.106 --> 00:25:13.348
SAM: Yeah, just roll a nature check. It's fine.

00:25:13.348 --> 00:25:14.635
LIAM: Everybody's doing it.

00:25:14.635 --> 00:25:16.682
TALIESIN: That's an eight. My nature sucks.

00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:19.117
MATT: You have no idea if sheep's pupils are
square.

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:22.273
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you. I didn't need to roll
to know that.

00:25:22.273 --> 00:25:23.554
MATT: All right.

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:27.741
TRAVIS: We press on.

00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:36.995
MATT: You push on? What little light you have
shoving back the darkness, via the dull orb that

00:25:36.995 --> 00:25:41.594
Caleb is carrying in the center of the heart of
your traveling troupe, you leave that first

00:25:41.594 --> 00:25:46.009
winding cavern and begin to continue down the
burrowed hallway created by this worm. It

00:25:46.009 --> 00:25:55.235
stretches on for a mile, two miles, five miles...

00:25:56.111 --> 00:26:02.740
MARISHA: Can I keep a lookout to see if there's
any markings on the walls? Any signs of

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.512
directional type of code or language?
While we're walking.

00:26:05.512 --> 00:26:07.307
MATT: Sure. Make a perception check.

00:26:07.307 --> 00:26:08.474
LAURA: Traps, too.

00:26:08.474 --> 00:26:13.093
SAM: Traps? No, they wouldn't think anyone would
be following them. They covered up the thing with

00:26:13.093 --> 00:26:15.915
200 feet of earth and rocks.

00:26:15.915 --> 00:26:18.247
MARISHA: 19.

00:26:18.247 --> 00:26:28.374
MATT: Walking along, the things you do notice is
the stone and earth seems fairly smooth, the way

00:26:28.374 --> 00:26:34.649
it's pushed through, but getting up close you can
see tiny little scrapes or hooks, where you gather

00:26:34.649 --> 00:26:38.874
is probably how the creature manages to break
through and push its way through, through

00:26:38.874 --> 00:26:46.465
expanding and contracting muscles within its long
body, and these spine or scale-like protrusions

00:26:46.465 --> 00:26:53.073
that dig in and pull it along rather quickly
underground. Beyond figuring out the locomotion of

00:26:53.073 --> 00:27:00.444
this entity, this creature, you don't, along this
part of the journey at least yet, see any signs of

00:27:00.444 --> 00:27:14.652
purposeful markings, essentially. Continuing on
for the next five to six hours, still following

00:27:14.652 --> 00:27:19.278
this tunnel, starting to get a little tired.

00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:22.768
TALIESIN: At some point we do need to rest.

00:27:22.768 --> 00:27:27.369
LAURA: I wonder if there's another big pocket o'
cavern coming up, or if we have to sleep in this

00:27:27.369 --> 00:27:28.589
little tunnel?

00:27:28.589 --> 00:27:32.424
TRAVIS: I forget what time we entered into the
tunnel. What time of day was it?

00:27:32.424 --> 00:27:36.247
MATT: If I recall, it was somewhere around midday,
a little after noon.

00:27:36.247 --> 00:27:39.940
TRAVIS: We could push on for another hour or two,
but we really should--

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.751
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb, what time is it?

00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:44.921
LIAM: Well, I will tell you.

00:27:44.921 --> 00:27:52.410
MATT: I'd say at this time, it's probably close to
dusk on the surface. Fucking feat.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.314
TRAVIS: You fucking feat.

00:27:55.314 --> 00:27:56.468
LIAM: It's in the book.

00:27:56.468 --> 00:27:58.282
MATT: I know it's in the book!

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.334
SAM: We're in the bored-out tunnel that the worm
made, right? There's no water near us, because we

00:28:03.334 --> 00:28:04.996
passed water on the way in.

00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:09.567
MATT: You passed water in the first cavern that
you went through. That lasted for maybe about a

00:28:09.607 --> 00:28:16.824
mile or so. The bulk of it weaving through where a
lot of the water passing through that river carved

00:28:16.824 --> 00:28:21.281
through the rock over time, but then eventually
that trailed off, and this burrow was the only

00:28:21.281 --> 00:28:26.280
other path to take. You've been there for a number
of hours now.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:36.505
SAM: You know that thing where you've gone so far
that you can't really-- we can't turn around, can

00:28:36.546 --> 00:28:40.366
we? It feels like it would be a waste of a day.
We've got to keep going.

00:28:40.366 --> 00:28:41.479
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:44.096
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:44.096 --> 00:28:49.914
MATT: You keep pressing on. All right. A few more
hours pass. People at the front, roll perception

00:28:49.914 --> 00:28:51.455
checks for me, please?

00:28:51.455 --> 00:28:53.231
LAURA: Again?

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:54.679
TRAVIS: I'll help.

00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:56.644
MARISHA: I have a question for Caduceus.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.667
LAURA: 17.

00:29:03.418 --> 00:29:07.678
MATT: Good to know. You had a question for
Caduceus, you said?

00:29:07.678 --> 00:29:11.276
MARISHA: Cad, do you have any idea how far
underground we are?

00:29:11.276 --> 00:29:12.333
TALIESIN: Nope.

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:14.772
MARISHA: Okay. That was my question.

00:29:14.772 --> 00:29:17.823
(laughter)

00:29:18.563 --> 00:29:19.803
TRAVIS: Succinct.

00:29:19.803 --> 00:29:22.139
TALIESIN: So glad it's one I can answer.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:31.411
MATT: You continue on for another hour or so. You
do come to another chamber, but it's only about 30

00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:39.233
by 20 feet wide, and it's a heavy geode. It looks
like there are a locked piece, a pocket of old,

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:44.657
stale air that was opened up as this worm burrowed
through. You can see broken crystals of many

00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:48.845
beautiful colors, a lot of them milky white,
quartz-like, a few that are almost a purple

00:29:48.845 --> 00:29:51.438
amethyst tint to it.

00:29:51.438 --> 00:29:54.278
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Light behind
the crystal.

00:29:54.278 --> 00:29:58.852
MATT: It's a beautiful prism. As you see, the
entire room is a scattering of shades of purple,

00:29:58.852 --> 00:30:03.749
pink, and, strangely, orange. It refracts the
light in a way you haven't seen before, and for

00:30:03.749 --> 00:30:09.176
the moment, this dark ominous space becomes this
beautiful disco.

00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:11.118
TALIESIN: I couldn't help myself.

00:30:11.118 --> 00:30:13.662
LAURA: Magical things live here, I bet.

00:30:13.662 --> 00:30:17.094
MARISHA: I've heard of faery creatures. I bet they
live--

00:30:17.094 --> 00:30:22.548
TALIESIN: I'm listening very carefully to see if
anything, any noise is coming from the next room.

00:30:22.548 --> 00:30:25.199
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:30:25.513 --> 00:30:27.170
TALIESIN: With advantage-- no, just perception.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.855
MATT: Just a perception check.

00:30:29.845 --> 00:30:32.312
TALIESIN: That is a 19.

00:30:32.312 --> 00:30:37.212
MATT: You take a moment and listen to the quiet.
No sound. No vibration.

00:30:37.212 --> 00:30:38.689
TALIESIN: Kill the light again.

00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:40.497
LAURA: Kill it? Why would you kill it?

00:30:40.497 --> 00:30:42.403
TALIESIN: We'll turn it back on, but I--

00:30:42.403 --> 00:30:43.878
LAURA: It was so beautiful!

00:30:43.878 --> 00:30:48.359
TRAVIS: We are going to rest, right? I mean, might
as well take advantage of such a nice place.

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:51.736
LAURA: Yeah, let's sleep in here. Is the ground
covered in crystal, too?

00:30:51.736 --> 00:30:56.870
MATT: Yes, on the edges of it. However, where the
worm had burrowed through, there's a part of the

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:01.541
ground that's digging into a divot. The interior
of the geode's been carved out in that space.

00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:06.189
TALIESIN: Is there any part of the wall that is
still stone and not crystal?

00:31:06.189 --> 00:31:11.008
MATT: There are small bits, maybe like two- or
three-feet pockets, but a large portion of this

00:31:11.008 --> 00:31:14.998
little geode chamber is mostly covered in crystal.

00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:18.606
LIAM: Has any of the crystal been broken away by
the worm's passage through here?

00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:21.063
MATT: Yes. Quite a bit of it has been cracked
and broken.

00:31:21.063 --> 00:31:25.015
LIAM: Does any of it look of value as a
rare stone?

00:31:25.015 --> 00:31:26.825
MATT: Make a nature check for me.

00:31:27.745 --> 00:31:29.187
SAM: You could tattoo with it.

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:30.346
LAURA: Yeah, maybe.

00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:31.873
LIAM: 16.

00:31:31.873 --> 00:31:39.329
MATT: A lot of this appears to be natural crystal.
It's not a particular gemstone or anything really

00:31:39.329 --> 00:31:45.782
precious, per se. You're sure you could probably--
there are uses for it. Some people like to use

00:31:45.782 --> 00:31:55.429
them as focuses for healing and for general decor.
Simple, cheap jewelry can be made from this as well.

00:31:55.429 --> 00:31:57.768
SAM: Vivid dreams, man!

00:31:57.768 --> 00:31:59.396
MATT: Yeah, there you go.

00:31:59.396 --> 00:32:00.929
LIAM: I'm going to scoop up a handful of them.

00:32:00.929 --> 00:32:02.749
LAURA: Me too, me too! It's pretty.

00:32:02.749 --> 00:32:03.613
SAM: Me three.

00:32:03.613 --> 00:32:08.000
MATT: Okay. You're not sure what the worth is.
You haven't delved in the realm of selling or

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.384
purchasing crystals in the street before, but you
imagine, depending on the person, you could

00:32:12.384 --> 00:32:15.052
probably get a little bit of coin for it.

00:32:15.337 --> 00:32:20.203
TALIESIN: I can carve out a chunk of wall if we
want to put your little dome inside.

00:32:20.203 --> 00:32:25.892
LIAM: Make it the same color as the crystals that
are here, and then I can also set an Alarm around us.

00:32:25.892 --> 00:32:29.053
MARISHA: It's see-through on the inside, right?

00:32:29.053 --> 00:32:31.872
LIAM: For us, yeah, but not from the outside.

00:32:32.172 --> 00:32:35.953
TALIESIN: Oh, so in that case, that's
pretty cool, then. I'll--

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:39.540
LIAM: I can camouflage it to match this room.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:46.542
TALIESIN: Once you build it, I'll use Stone
Shape to cover it, then, so you can give it

00:32:46.542 --> 00:32:48.440
a little bit of a shell.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.082
LIAM: Yeah, so it's not such a perfect,
round surface.

00:32:51.082 --> 00:32:52.918
MATT: What are you doing?

00:32:53.086 --> 00:33:01.942
TALIESIN: Once he puts up the dome, the shack,
I'm going to use Stone Shape to cover it really

00:33:01.942 --> 00:33:06.023
quickly with a thin layer of rock
to make it look...

00:33:06.023 --> 00:33:07.026
TRAVIS: Earthen?

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:11.361
TALIESIN: Earthen. It's not like five feet thick
of rock, but a couple inches to blanket it.

00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:15.833
MATT: Yeah. You couldn't cover the entire dome,
but you could definitely create a portion of it

00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:16.694
that's in a shell.

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.696
TALIESIN: It's going to have a faux front.

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:21.908
LIAM: If we leave an area where we can
pop our heads out if need be.

00:33:21.908 --> 00:33:24.196
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it's going to be an opening.

00:33:24.196 --> 00:33:28.761
LIAM: Did you say you were going to carve a hole
to put it inside of, or should I make it against

00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:29.911
the side of the chamber?

00:33:29.911 --> 00:33:34.377
TALIESIN: Probably put it against so we can see
what's behind. I don't know, what do you think?

00:33:34.377 --> 00:33:36.519
TRAVIS: Backs against a wall are always safe.

00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:40.073
LAURA: This is true. I agree with Fjord.

00:33:40.073 --> 00:33:41.696
LIAM: Okay.

00:33:41.696 --> 00:33:46.259
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull the rock that I used
for that front from the wall, and I'm going to

00:33:46.259 --> 00:33:51.148
give us a couple feet in, if that's possible, just
to push something. I've been looking at

00:33:51.148 --> 00:33:54.443
Stone Shape and what it'll do.

00:33:54.443 --> 00:34:01.561
MATT: You essentially diffuse element of that
rock away from it to create the shell on the

00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:04.768
opposite side. Totally doable. You create a hut?

00:34:04.971 --> 00:34:10.783
LIAM: I take out my book, and I slap it down on
the stone surface of this chamber we are in. I

00:34:10.783 --> 00:34:16.652
take about ten minutes, and then there is a
hemisphere that is the same color as the chamber

00:34:16.652 --> 00:34:22.279
around us. As soon as that is done, I then take
out the silver thread, and I start making a little

00:34:22.279 --> 00:34:26.722
white picket fence that's not actually a
picket fence in front of that.

00:34:26.722 --> 00:34:31.951
MATT: You guys take your evening's rest.

00:34:31.951 --> 00:34:40.420
LAURA: Wait! I'm going to use Sending. I'm going
to send a message to Yussa, and I'm going to say--

00:34:41.299 --> 00:34:49.677
shit, I didn't have time to write it out. Hello!
It's Jester. We're bringing that dodecahedron

00:34:49.677 --> 00:35:00.127
with us. We're on our way to...
(whispering) I can't remember the name of the--

00:35:00.127 --> 00:35:01.208
SAM: Xhorhas.

00:35:01.208 --> 00:35:05.674
LAURA: Xhorhas. Do you think it's dangerous?
Should we not?

00:35:06.373 --> 00:35:07.678
SAM: Is that it?

00:35:07.678 --> 00:35:09.253
TRAVIS: Five more.

00:35:09.253 --> 00:35:11.309
LAURA: Please respond to this message.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.407
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:35:13.913 --> 00:35:15.439
SAM: Getting good at this.

00:35:15.439 --> 00:35:16.942
LAURA: Yeah, right?

00:35:17.766 --> 00:35:29.267
MATT: There's a pause. Then the voice comes
through, "Well, I would say it is not advised to

00:35:29.267 --> 00:35:38.981
"give it up, to pull it out of your bag. But
who am I to keep you from taking an artifact

00:35:38.981 --> 00:35:41.083
"into the heart of danger?"

00:35:44.149 --> 00:35:45.886
LAURA: I think he's cool with it.

00:35:47.214 --> 00:35:48.901
SAM: We're making the right choice.

00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:51.815
TRAVIS: This is 100% what we're supposed
to be doing.

00:35:51.815 --> 00:35:56.048
MATT: You have a high enough wisdom to know
that there was a hint of biting sarcasm to his

00:35:56.048 --> 00:35:58.558
statement, but interpret that as you will.

00:35:58.558 --> 00:36:01.481
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:36:01.481 --> 00:36:04.915
TRAVIS: Confirmation. We're doing good.

00:36:05.452 --> 00:36:09.289
MATT: Now, is everyone taking a comfortable
evening's rest within the hut?

00:36:09.289 --> 00:36:13.296
TRAVIS: Do we want to take watches? We're pretty
safe, right?

00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.926
SAM and TALIESIN: No watch needed.

00:36:14.926 --> 00:36:19.732
LAURA: I mean, unless somebody wants to keep a
watch and make sure nothing comes by.

00:36:19.732 --> 00:36:22.835
TALIESIN: That's what the thread-- the thread will
wake us if it--

00:36:22.835 --> 00:36:26.786
MATT: You do have a pretty decent setup, between
the Tiny Hut and the Alarm threads.

00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:29.123
TRAVIS: Let's all try it. Everybody's sleeping.

00:36:29.123 --> 00:36:33.748
LAURA: Get a good night's sleep. Can you put a
night light on, though, because it's really pretty.

00:36:34.473 --> 00:36:36.826
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:36:36.826 --> 00:36:47.954
LIAM: I also send Frumpkin out of the hut to sit
in the shadows of the chamber, and I tell him to

00:36:47.954 --> 00:36:53.360
come and wake me up if he hears anything coming
further than the perimeter of the alarm.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:37:03.604
MATT: Okay. You guys all find yourself to rest
here, deep beneath the surface of Exandria. For

00:37:03.604 --> 00:37:13.908
some of you, dreams come. For some of you, no,
it's a clean sleep-to-wake experience, until

00:37:13.908 --> 00:37:18.787
eventually, you slowly come to consciousness,
feeling rested, though strange to not have a day

00:37:18.787 --> 00:37:23.418
or night cycle. Nothing has changed from your
experience. You feel like you've rested, but have

00:37:23.418 --> 00:37:27.710
you? It could have been an hour; it could have
been eight hours. Being this far beneath the

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:32.226
surface for an extended period of time is going
to be a little strange for those of you who have

00:37:32.226 --> 00:37:35.467
not had that experience, which is all of you.

00:37:35.467 --> 00:37:41.153
LIAM: Legitimate question, because I don't
want to dick with the story you're weaving,

00:37:41.153 --> 00:37:44.447
but does Keen Mind cut through that?

00:37:44.692 --> 00:37:51.089
MATT: You would know-- that's a good question.
Let me look it up real fast.

00:37:51.449 --> 00:37:54.724
TRAVIS: Look how pretty that book is. God. Sexy.

00:37:54.724 --> 00:37:56.967
SAM: It really is sexy.

00:37:57.837 --> 00:38:00.873
MATT: "You always know the number of hours left
before the next sunrise or sunset." I'd say, yeah,

00:38:00.873 --> 00:38:06.239
you'd be able to tell everyone. Even just
informing everyone of the time, it's still--

00:38:06.239 --> 00:38:08.745
LIAM: It won't mean anything to them.
They'll be--

00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:13.477
MATT: You can say it and be like: Oh yeah, guys,
it's 9:00 in the morning! You're like: cool.

00:38:13.477 --> 00:38:21.156
No issues. Nothing has changed. Frumpkin did not
notice anything out of the ordinary. As the hut

00:38:21.156 --> 00:38:27.121
comes to a close, and you step out from behind the
somewhat created stone shell placed by Caduceus,

00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:29.260
the tunnel is yours.

00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:34.558
TALIESIN: Lighting it up again because it's nice.

00:38:34.558 --> 00:38:37.047
SAM: On we go!

00:38:37.047 --> 00:38:44.413
LIAM: Frumpkin also skips up Nott's back and
snuggles in, grips her clothing with her claws--

00:38:44.413 --> 00:38:49.648
his claws, damn my original cat--
and scarfs around Nott's neck.

00:38:49.648 --> 00:38:56.261
MATT: You got it. As Frumpkin keeps you
warm in the throat region,

00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:58.369
you all continue onward. Same order?

00:38:58.369 --> 00:38:59.570
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:03.876
MATT: Those helming the charge at the
front, either each take an individual

00:39:03.876 --> 00:39:06.777
perception check, or you may
help for advantage.

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:08.665
LAURA: Go for it? Okay, okay, okay.

00:39:08.665 --> 00:39:09.949
LIAM: Mage Armor.

00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:11.855
MATT: Mage Armor, yeah, good call.

00:39:15.428 --> 00:39:18.151
LAURA: 19 again.

00:39:18.151 --> 00:39:27.240
MATT: Nice. A few more miles of winding tunnel
continue before you, and it's a very trying,

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:37.331
monotonous experience, where it's lengths of
time and travel where there's no real change

00:39:37.368 --> 00:39:46.556
in topography. Slight variations as it winds in
this natural shifting with the physicality of the

00:39:46.556 --> 00:39:54.511
creature that burrowed it, but it's this
cylindrical of stone and earth for hours

00:39:54.511 --> 00:40:03.681
and hours, until you catch the next first glimpse
of another chamber opening before you.

00:40:03.681 --> 00:40:07.383
LAURA: Do I see any movement in it?

00:40:07.383 --> 00:40:14.514
MATT: You do not see any movement. As you get a
little closer, you can begin to see the interior

00:40:14.514 --> 00:40:20.283
of the chamber near where it opens up inside. The
air here is already pretty chilly, here beneath

00:40:20.283 --> 00:40:26.484
the surface. The air has more moisture to it than
the tunnel you've been traveling through.

00:40:26.484 --> 00:40:32.164
You can smell a bit of that heavy mineral
subterranean water scent. You listen in for

00:40:32.164 --> 00:40:37.870
a second, and you can hear the subtle dripping
of condensation, probably from the ceiling,

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.891
which means there's probably a nearby water
source somewhere in the vicinity.

00:40:42.891 --> 00:40:45.485
There is a chamber that opens up ahead of you.

00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:47.711
LAURA: There's a chamber ahead of us.

00:40:47.908 --> 00:40:48.878
SAM: Oh my god!

00:40:48.878 --> 00:40:50.469
LAURA: It sounds wet, Nott.

00:40:50.469 --> 00:40:51.305
SAM: No!

00:40:51.305 --> 00:40:54.266
LAURA: I know. I know.

00:40:54.921 --> 00:40:55.837
SAM: Ah!

00:40:55.837 --> 00:40:59.071
LAURA: I didn't think we'd have to deal
with a water issue down here.

00:40:59.071 --> 00:41:02.087
SAM: Well, you said it sounds wet?
What does that even mean?

00:41:02.087 --> 00:41:04.751
LAURA: There could be an underground river.
I don't know.

00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:06.766
SAM: Or it could just be wet.

00:41:06.766 --> 00:41:08.444
TRAVIS: (dripping water noises)

00:41:08.444 --> 00:41:11.488
LAURA: Or yeah, it could be that. Or it
could be a water monster.

00:41:11.488 --> 00:41:16.101
SAM: Or Fjord could be dicking around
with his cheek trick.

00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:17.815
TRAVIS: Sorry, was I throwing you?

00:41:17.815 --> 00:41:20.877
LAURA: When we approach it, I'm going to cast
Pass Without a Trace on all of us, and

00:41:20.877 --> 00:41:23.978
we'll approach it stealthily. What do you
guys think about that?

00:41:23.978 --> 00:41:25.432
SAM: Yes, yes, yes! Good idea.

00:41:25.542 --> 00:41:29.680
LAURA: Okay. We're approaching it stealthily.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.934
MATT: Roll stealth checks for me, please.

00:41:32.998 --> 00:41:35.517
SAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Stealth checks!

00:41:35.865 --> 00:41:37.659
SAM: Don't fuck me, Gil.

00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:39.444
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

00:41:39.444 --> 00:41:40.619
LAURA: Add ten.

00:41:40.619 --> 00:41:41.448
TRAVIS: 30.

00:41:41.448 --> 00:41:43.373
MATT: Pass Without a Trace. Good call.

00:41:43.813 --> 00:41:45.525
LAURA: Oh, what, is everybody going?

00:41:45.525 --> 00:41:47.141
TALIESIN: Yeah, we already did it.

00:41:47.141 --> 00:41:47.850
TRAVIS: 30.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:48.568
TALIESIN: 21.

00:41:48.568 --> 00:41:49.427
MARISHA: 31.

00:41:49.427 --> 00:41:50.199
LAURA: 24.

00:41:50.199 --> 00:41:51.929
SAM and LIAM: 30.

00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:53.687
MATT: Did you roll for Yasha as well?

00:41:53.687 --> 00:41:58.104
TRAVIS: Oh, balls and anus. Here you go. 22. No!

00:41:58.104 --> 00:41:59.663
LAURA: Plus ten?

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:01.551
TRAVIS: 24.

00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:12.058
MATT: Moving into the chamber as it opens in,
you can see this area has quite a heavy clustering

00:42:12.058 --> 00:42:18.416
of stalagmites and stalactites all across the
interior of this chamber. It opens up maybe

00:42:18.416 --> 00:42:24.843
40 or so feet wide, and it seems to curve around
this large bend. Elements of it rise. While you

00:42:24.843 --> 00:42:29.845
do not see a river, looking up at where the
water's dripping from, you get the sense

00:42:29.845 --> 00:42:35.937
there might be a large body of water not that
far above. Elements of the groundwater are

00:42:35.937 --> 00:42:42.317
trickling through, and elements are gathering
to create the interior of this chamber.

00:42:42.317 --> 00:42:45.097
TALIESIN: I did not prepare for that.

00:42:45.097 --> 00:42:47.593
LAURA: What would be above us?

00:42:47.593 --> 00:42:51.003
TRAVIS: Oh, a river, pond.

00:42:51.003 --> 00:42:52.337
TALIESIN: There was a river.

00:42:52.337 --> 00:42:53.912
MARISHA: Underwater water source?

00:42:53.912 --> 00:42:57.539
LAURA: Yeah, where are we? We could figure
out where we are. Where's the map?

00:42:57.539 --> 00:42:59.686
LIAM: We've been traveling for miles, though.

00:42:59.686 --> 00:43:02.165
LAURA: Yeah, but we know which direction
we're going.

00:43:02.165 --> 00:43:04.972
LIAM: That's true, I know which way is north.
It's that way.

00:43:04.972 --> 00:43:06.642
MATT: Yes. You know where north is.

00:43:06.642 --> 00:43:08.784
LAURA: We're under the big river then, maybe.

00:43:08.784 --> 00:43:11.779
MATT: You don't have a GPS, per se, but
you know where north is.

00:43:11.779 --> 00:43:16.500
LIAM: No, but the whole time we've been walking,
I've been conscious of which direction north is in.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.871
MATT: Right, so you have a vague idea. You've
been traveling for a day from Felderwin, right?

00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:28.560
So it's about, say, 24 miles in a day.
You'd be about there. This vicinity here,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.395
so you're right in this vicinity.

00:43:30.395 --> 00:43:34.886
TRAVIS: Yep, big-ass body of water.
Big enough to show up on a map.

00:43:34.886 --> 00:43:40.940
MATT: There are the heavy stalagmites and
rock protrusions from the ground that

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.347
litter the interior of the chamber as it
curves off to the side.

00:43:44.347 --> 00:43:48.135
TALIESIN: Well, that's a good sign. That means
that this is at least a natural cavern, which

00:43:48.135 --> 00:43:52.553
means it's been here for a long time, and
whatever's above hasn't disturbed it.

00:43:52.553 --> 00:43:54.035
LAURA: Good point.

00:43:54.045 --> 00:43:56.047
TALIESIN: That's good. That's a good sign.

00:43:56.047 --> 00:44:00.522
LIAM: From where we are-- I don't know if I can,
because I can only see from this little bit of

00:44:00.522 --> 00:44:04.183
dim light, but where from this chamber the
worm continued on straight through?

00:44:04.183 --> 00:44:06.516
MATT: You cannot see where the worm went through.

00:44:06.516 --> 00:44:07.994
LIAM: Can't see the other side?

00:44:07.994 --> 00:44:12.049
MATT: Can't see the other side. It looks like
the worm, when it entered this chamber--

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:15.285
you don't see in your vicinity where it
may have continued to burrow.

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:16.714
LAURA: Oh, we have to find it.

00:44:16.714 --> 00:44:20.806
MATT: You get the sense that maybe this creature,
and the people that were steering it,

00:44:20.806 --> 00:44:24.332
were leading it through whatever open
chambers were possible, and then only

00:44:24.332 --> 00:44:26.288
burrowing when there was no continuation.

00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:29.425
LIAM: Maybe gave it a run-around in here,
like a dog in a dog park.

00:44:29.425 --> 00:44:33.234
LAURA: I guess we should search around and
see if we can find a hole in the wall.

00:44:33.234 --> 00:44:37.179
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to have a little
light and see if I can find any tracks or

00:44:37.179 --> 00:44:39.850
anything for this thing, or any other footprints.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.732
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:44:41.732 --> 00:44:48.865
MARISHA: I look to see if there's any signs of
life, any humans that have been here before, people.

00:44:48.865 --> 00:44:51.697
MATT: You're looking for...?

00:44:51.769 --> 00:44:54.876
MARISHA: Signs of life or signs that
people have been here before?

00:44:54.876 --> 00:44:56.335
TRAVIS: Biped signs of life?

00:44:56.335 --> 00:44:58.145
LAURA: Follow their path or something?

00:44:58.145 --> 00:45:00.625
MARISHA: Yeah, campfires that have been
extinguished.

00:45:00.625 --> 00:45:03.953
MATT: Okay, so both of you are looking for
essentially signs of things.

00:45:03.953 --> 00:45:05.951
LAURA: I will look for a hole in the wall.

00:45:05.951 --> 00:45:09.255
MATT: Okay. Perception check and then
survival check from each of you.

00:45:09.255 --> 00:45:10.423
TALIESIN: I got a 21.

00:45:10.573 --> 00:45:11.629
MATT: 21? Okay.

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.103
SAM: You got this.

00:45:13.103 --> 00:45:13.859
MARISHA: 11.

00:45:13.859 --> 00:45:15.010
SAM: You don't got this.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.470
LAURA: <i>Nein</i>! Wait, plus-- 14!

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:24.671
MATT: That's better. All right. Looking around,
you continue to see the footfalls, the footprints

00:45:24.671 --> 00:45:32.136
along the patches of ground where it seems like
dirt and dust has been settled in areas that are

00:45:32.136 --> 00:45:41.335
a little bit wet from the moisture in the air. You
can see some of these grimy recesses in the muck

00:45:41.335 --> 00:45:45.773
and the dirt that is similar to the footfalls
you've already seen in previous chambers of what

00:45:45.773 --> 00:45:54.590
appears to be of the Kryn. You can see some of the
stone formations in the ground. Two of them appear

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:59.660
to be broken and pushed over where it looks like
the creature may have shoved its way through.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:05.416
It goes around the edge and then curves up out of
sight. You can try to continue to look in that

00:46:05.416 --> 00:46:10.127
direction, but from what you can see the
vicinity, that's the path it's taking.

00:46:10.924 --> 00:46:12.324
You were looking for...?

00:46:12.324 --> 00:46:13.560
LAURA: Holes in the walls.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:18.353
MATT: Holes in the wall? All right. Looking around
the vicinity, you don't see any holes in the wall.

00:46:18.353 --> 00:46:23.808
You do see there are elements in the rock where
there are cracks and you can see where small bits

00:46:23.808 --> 00:46:28.130
of water are slowly dribbling through and then
(dripping).

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:31.260
LAURA: I bet the rock formations in this room
are amazing.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.549
MATT: They're pretty decent.

00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:38.432
LAURA: That one looks like a fried egg,
look at that. Do you see it?

00:46:38.432 --> 00:46:39.406
SAM: I do.

00:46:39.406 --> 00:46:41.838
LAURA: Looks like an egg on the top. Do you see?

00:46:41.838 --> 00:46:46.278
SAM: I do. And it's even a little bit yellow.
You should probably paint a dick on it.

00:46:46.278 --> 00:46:48.869
LAURA: I probably should.

00:46:48.869 --> 00:46:51.448
SAM: I mean, you could tag the whole place.

00:46:51.448 --> 00:46:55.178
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god, I should make this
a temple to the Traveler!

00:46:55.178 --> 00:46:56.300
SAM: Yes!

00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:01.628
TRAVIS: Well, Jester, aren't temples better served
by like, heavy foot traffic? You know--

00:47:01.628 --> 00:47:06.000
LAURA: Yeah but think about how cool it would be
if someone came down here and they were like

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.092
"what's going on?" and then they find like--

00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:09.321
SAM: It's a speakeasy.

00:47:09.321 --> 00:47:10.562
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:47:10.562 --> 00:47:12.109
SAM: But it's like a pray-easy.

00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:16.700
LAURA: And then they like, they find it, they're
going to be like: "That is like, so important.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.445
I must definitely worship this guy because..." And it
will at least get one person you know, added--

00:47:21.445 --> 00:47:23.222
SAM: You could be the bouncer.

00:47:23.222 --> 00:47:26.071
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but how much time do you need
to dig up this cave?

00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:31.770
LAURA: I don't! I'm just going to... I'm going
to paint, you know, a really nice picture of

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:36.912
the Traveler. Then I'm going to use my paint--
my special paint-- and I'm going to make

00:47:36.912 --> 00:47:42.247
a nice little figurine of the Traveler. And I'll
sit it on top of the best-looking rock formation

00:47:42.247 --> 00:47:47.711
that looks like it's definitely for him.
I'm going to paint like, pretty things

00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:49.859
around him like sparkles and shit.

00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:52.405
MATT: Perfect. So you paint a little figure
of the--

00:47:52.405 --> 00:47:56.270
TRAVIS: We'll keep an eye on the entrance
and exits.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.148
MATT: So you're watching the entrance--

00:47:58.148 --> 00:48:02.792
TRAVIS: I'll go to over where we think from
Beau's notes the creature seems to have gone.

00:48:02.792 --> 00:48:06.009
MATT: Okay. So yeah, as you walk over there,
there is an area where it curves in then rises up

00:48:06.009 --> 00:48:10.221
a little bit. To the left, you can see a
small pool of water where it's gathered

00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:15.937
and created this little tucked in the side pool,
maybe five-foot by 15 feet.

00:48:15.937 --> 00:48:19.918
TALIESIN: Does it smell clean, is it clear?

00:48:19.918 --> 00:48:23.060
MATT: Go ahead and get close to it,
it looks clear. It looks very--

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.710
TALIESIN: Can I see the bottom?

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:29.605
MATT: You can see the bottom, it looks to be no
more than have five, six feet deep. You can see

00:48:29.605 --> 00:48:34.719
where it continues up off to that side.
Jester finishes painting the statue.

00:48:34.719 --> 00:48:38.828
You look around for somewhere to place it.
There are a number of these larger

00:48:38.828 --> 00:48:45.496
rock formations, five, ten feet tall, eight-foot
tall, little squat ones. What do you want?

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.860
LAURA: I'm going to put it on the
little squat one.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.914
MATT: Okay.

00:48:49.914 --> 00:48:54.594
LAURA: But then put some of the crystals
that I got in my pocket, like around it.

00:48:54.594 --> 00:49:00.271
Then on the tall formation, I'm going to write
"The Traveler is the tits! Worship him!"

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:01.007
SAM: Nice.

00:49:01.007 --> 00:49:02.163
LAURA: Like, vertically.

00:49:02.163 --> 00:49:05.588
MATT: Perfect. All right. She's writing that down.
You were at the front?

00:49:05.588 --> 00:49:06.301
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:49:06.301 --> 00:49:07.734
MATT: Who's watching the back?

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:09.694
TALIESIN: I'll keep an eye on the back.

00:49:09.694 --> 00:49:14.021
MATT: All right. Perception check, both of you
guys, just to make sure you're keeping watch.

00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:16.313
MARISHA: Just looking over his shoulder.

00:49:16.313 --> 00:49:19.188
TRAVIS: Nice. 20-- 20. No, 21.

00:49:19.188 --> 00:49:21.061
TALIESIN: 24.

00:49:21.061 --> 00:49:26.128
MATT: All right, you watch the distant path, the
dark that continues curving up off to the side.

00:49:26.128 --> 00:49:32.127
You look over there. No movement. You're looking
towards the tunnel where you guys came from.

00:49:32.127 --> 00:49:37.808
No movement. You hear the chuckles and look back
at what they're doing. You see one of these

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:43.841
stalagmites, these tendrils (slurping).
Need to roll initiative.

00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:46.203
(yelling)

00:49:46.203 --> 00:49:49.429
MATT: Actually, only you need to roll
initiative because they--

00:49:49.429 --> 00:49:52.211
SAM: They? They? He? It?

00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:53.867
MATT and LAURA: They.

00:49:53.867 --> 00:49:55.361
MATT: Get a surprise round.

00:49:55.361 --> 00:49:56.796
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:49:56.796 --> 00:49:59.696
SAM: We all took feats that make us
immune to surprise, right?

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:02.316
LAURA: Yeah, we all took Luck, right?
We all took Luck?

00:50:02.316 --> 00:50:05.409
TRAVIS: 18 is pretty good, considering
I have no initiative bonus.

00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:07.595
SAM and MARISHA: You have no initiative bonus?

00:50:07.595 --> 00:50:08.298
TRAVIS: No!

00:50:08.298 --> 00:50:09.581
SAM: What's wrong with you?

00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:11.774
TRAVIS: I don't know. Half-orcs. I don't know.

00:50:11.774 --> 00:50:13.918
SAM: Why am I rolling these weird dice today?

00:50:13.918 --> 00:50:16.869
TRAVIS: I could have taken a feat that
would've given me, but--

00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:18.404
LAURA: Oh see? Think about how--

00:50:18.404 --> 00:50:19.486
ALL: Oh.

00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:20.842
TRAVIS: What is this thing?!

00:50:20.842 --> 00:50:21.587
LIAM: Ropers!

00:50:21.587 --> 00:50:22.778
SAM: This is a great map!

00:50:22.778 --> 00:50:24.162
LAURA: What are those things?

00:50:24.162 --> 00:50:26.586
TRAVIS: What is that sadistic Japanese
traffic cone?

00:50:26.586 --> 00:50:29.415
LAURA: So wait, where are we putting
the Traveler stuff?

00:50:29.415 --> 00:50:32.317
MATT: By this little tiny squat one.

00:50:32.317 --> 00:50:33.391
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:33.391 --> 00:50:34.467
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

00:50:34.467 --> 00:50:35.721
LAURA: Oh, it's so cool.

00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:37.620
SAM: They look like stalagmites!

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.398
LIAM: We are in the kill zone, y'all.

00:50:39.398 --> 00:50:41.927
MATT: You were over on this side
looking off this way.

00:50:41.927 --> 00:50:43.781
TRAVIS: Oh fucking balls. What is this?

00:50:43.781 --> 00:50:45.590
MATT: Nott, were you helping them out?

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.163
SAM: No, I was hanging out with Beau.
Wherever Beau is.

00:50:48.163 --> 00:50:49.407
MATT: Beau is right there.

00:50:49.407 --> 00:50:50.495
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:50:50.495 --> 00:50:54.577
MATT: Yasha will be keeping an eye, not noticing.
Caleb, where were you?

00:50:54.577 --> 00:50:58.929
LIAM: I would be by the largest grouping of people
because I'm scared of everything.

00:50:58.929 --> 00:51:02.177
TRAVIS: (laughs) What the fuck is that?

00:51:03.587 --> 00:51:04.995
MATT: All right then.

00:51:05.365 --> 00:51:06.832
LIAM: This is real bad.

00:51:06.832 --> 00:51:07.992
TRAVIS: Is it?

00:51:07.992 --> 00:51:09.004
LIAM: Well...

00:51:09.004 --> 00:51:10.193
LAURA: No! It's real bad!

00:51:10.193 --> 00:51:11.920
LIAM: You don't know, I don't know.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.619
MATT: So. Initiative orders. 25 to 20.

00:51:14.619 --> 00:51:16.073
LAURA: Oh! I didn't roll...

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:17.698
MATT: I just said roll initiative!

00:51:17.698 --> 00:51:21.217
LAURA: I know! But I thought you said
don't because they got a surprise...

00:51:21.217 --> 00:51:22.410
MATT: Just so we have it.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.854
LAURA: Oh no, six...

00:51:23.854 --> 00:51:25.727
MATT: Okay. 25 to 20.

00:51:25.727 --> 00:51:26.897
MARISHA: 19.

00:51:26.897 --> 00:51:28.085
SAM: That's not 25 to 20.

00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:30.177
MARISHA: It's not, but no one else spoke up.

00:51:30.177 --> 00:51:31.043
MATT: It's fine.

00:51:31.043 --> 00:51:32.119
TRAVIS: 18 for Fjord.

00:51:32.119 --> 00:51:34.587
MATT: All right. 15 to ten.

00:51:34.587 --> 00:51:36.171
TRAVIS: Yasha got a 14.

00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:37.887
LIAM: 12 for Caleb.

00:51:37.887 --> 00:51:39.262
TALIESIN: 12 for me as well.

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:40.597
SAM: 12 for me as well.

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.426
LAURA: Lot of twelves.

00:51:42.426 --> 00:51:48.660
MARISHA: So Cad, Caleb, Nott.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.198
TALIESIN: This is going to be...

00:51:50.198 --> 00:51:51.637
SAM: It's going to be easy.

00:51:51.637 --> 00:51:53.457
MARISHA: I had a screamer earlier.

00:51:54.527 --> 00:51:56.754
MATT: Then we have Jester at the bottom.

00:51:56.754 --> 00:51:59.445
LAURA: I'm really distracted, you know,
because I'm--

00:51:59.814 --> 00:52:00.991
SAM: Painting.

00:52:00.991 --> 00:52:02.612
LAURA: I'm painting a beautiful--

00:52:02.612 --> 00:52:04.973
MATT: So. Fjord. You go first.

00:52:04.973 --> 00:52:06.010
TRAVIS: I do?

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:10.656
MATT: You're the only one who noticed them in
this scenario. Because you were the one who's

00:52:10.656 --> 00:52:16.252
closest to the actual-- Caduceus is facing on the
back side of the chamber. What are you doing?

00:52:16.252 --> 00:52:23.647
TRAVIS: Well I have a short moment of freak out
as a rock formation grows fucking tentacles.

00:52:23.647 --> 00:52:28.400
MATT: Yep. Two of them. You see that one and go,
"Shit! Shit!" And you see them both go (gurgling).

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.388
TRAVIS: Since the rest of the group doesn't seem
to have noticed them, I will charge up two

00:52:33.388 --> 00:52:35.670
Eldritch Blasts and send one in each direction.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:36.556
MATT: All righty.

00:52:36.556 --> 00:52:38.038
TRAVIS: Point both of them out.

00:52:38.048 --> 00:52:39.911
MATT: Go for it. Roll attacks for each.

00:52:39.911 --> 00:52:41.424
TRAVIS: I will do it.

00:52:43.061 --> 00:52:44.856
That is 16 to hit.

00:52:44.856 --> 00:52:50.941
MATT: It (poofing) just dissipates without
effect across its rocky, armored surface.

00:52:50.941 --> 00:52:56.062
TRAVIS: Not good. Can I bonus action Hex
the second one?

00:52:56.062 --> 00:52:56.986
MATT: Sure.

00:52:56.986 --> 00:52:58.658
TRAVIS: Before the other attack?

00:52:58.658 --> 00:52:59.899
MATT: Which one? This one?

00:52:59.899 --> 00:53:00.725
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:53:00.725 --> 00:53:01.890
MATT: All right.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:05.492
TRAVIS: That'll at least help a little bit. 17.

00:53:05.492 --> 00:53:09.205
MATT: (poofing). No effect. You watch as
the Eldritch energy, the green burst, just

00:53:09.205 --> 00:53:13.072
scatters across its rocky exterior.
No impact.

00:53:13.072 --> 00:53:14.681
TRAVIS: Big trouble!

00:53:14.681 --> 00:53:15.985
SAM: What?

00:53:15.985 --> 00:53:17.310
MARISHA: What did you roll?

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:21.686
TRAVIS: 17 didn't hit it. I'll come up on top of
that platform and take a little bit of cover

00:53:21.686 --> 00:53:26.165
behind that-- Yeah. Just right there is good.
I don't know what the fuck they do.

00:53:26.165 --> 00:53:29.876
SAM: Did we see these attacks fail?

00:53:29.876 --> 00:53:34.797
MATT: You all of a sudden heard a (poof) and
you heard him shout as you turn around and saw

00:53:34.797 --> 00:53:40.956
Fjord shout, "Big trouble!" and then vanish behind
a nearby rock. Like a hero.

00:53:40.956 --> 00:53:43.613
TRAVIS: Or a tactician!

00:53:43.613 --> 00:53:49.435
MATT: I know. In this moment of realization
of what's happening, these two large

00:53:49.435 --> 00:53:54.404
stalagmites suddenly have a single eye
that opens in the center, this burning red

00:53:54.404 --> 00:54:00.065
orange-ish eye with a vertical slit. The
center of it opens up into this large,

00:54:00.065 --> 00:54:04.047
gaping mouth of sharpened teeth and a
liquid tongue on the inside that's

00:54:04.047 --> 00:54:09.251
slimy-ing around. These four tendrils
that unravel. So it's now their turn.

00:54:09.251 --> 00:54:13.275
It's going to move there. Five, ten.

00:54:13.275 --> 00:54:16.203
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter)

00:54:16.203 --> 00:54:18.956
SAM: They don't move fast, but-- oops.

00:54:18.956 --> 00:54:23.160
MATT: They shift, it looks like they're
gliding, but there's thousands of tiny cilia

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:29.044
underneath that just cause them to glide
across the ground. This one on this end is

00:54:29.044 --> 00:54:39.397
going to go ahead and make three attacks.
Each can make four tendril attacks.

00:54:40.317 --> 00:54:41.569
TRAVIS: Four?!

00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:42.748
MATT: Yes. So.

00:54:42.748 --> 00:54:44.512
LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to die.

00:54:44.512 --> 00:54:45.566
MARISHA: Oh, we might.

00:54:45.566 --> 00:54:46.947
SAM: No, you're going to die.

00:54:46.947 --> 00:54:49.178
MATT: Jester, that is a 21 to hit.

00:54:49.178 --> 00:54:50.493
LAURA: It hits me.

00:54:50.493 --> 00:54:52.116
MATT: All right. You are grappled.

00:54:52.116 --> 00:54:53.166
LAURA: Oh no.

00:54:53.166 --> 00:54:57.358
MATT: While you're grappled, you are restrained
and have disadvantage on strength checks.

00:54:57.358 --> 00:55:01.684
There's one now to Beau. That's going 
to be a 14 to hit.

00:55:01.684 --> 00:55:02.745
MARISHA: Miss.

00:55:02.745 --> 00:55:05.729
MATT: Against Beau again, that's going
to be a 25 to hit.

00:55:05.729 --> 00:55:07.110
MARISHA: Ah yeah.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.521
MATT: So you are grappled.

00:55:10.521 --> 00:55:11.638
MARISHA: Just grappled?

00:55:11.638 --> 00:55:12.896
MATT: Yep.

00:55:12.896 --> 00:55:14.386
SAM: Oh, okay, they don't hurt.

00:55:14.386 --> 00:55:16.905
LAURA: Maybe the next turn they will
swallow us whole.

00:55:16.905 --> 00:55:18.125
SAM: I don't think so.

00:55:18.125 --> 00:55:20.094
TRAVIS: No evidence to support that.

00:55:20.094 --> 00:55:26.653
MATT: We'll say you're grappled, Beau.
You're also grappled. I'm putting

00:55:26.653 --> 00:55:30.906
restrained there because you are technically
restrained as well. Against Nott--

00:55:30.906 --> 00:55:32.219
SAM: What, me?

00:55:32.219 --> 00:55:39.159
MATT: Yep. As it (whoosh) out that way,
that one's going to be 17?

00:55:39.159 --> 00:55:40.038
SAM: Miss.

00:55:40.038 --> 00:55:43.570
MATT: Misses. You just duck underneath.
The fourth one's going to swing out

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:46.600
towards you as well. That's going to be a 20.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.581
SAM: Hit.

00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:49.670
MATT: You are also grappled.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.629
LAURA: Oh my god, wait, was that all just
one creature attacking us or was that--?

00:55:53.629 --> 00:55:54.998
MATT: Correct.

00:55:54.998 --> 00:55:57.165
SAM: There's no save against this grapple?

00:55:57.165 --> 00:56:01.071
MATT: You can try and escape it. It's an
action to try and escape from the grapple.

00:56:01.071 --> 00:56:05.111
You can still attack, but you're restrained,
so you have disadvantage on your attacks.

00:56:05.111 --> 00:56:08.725
MARISHA: Strength check versus their
strength check, if I remember correctly.

00:56:08.725 --> 00:56:11.985
MATT: It's your athletics or acrobatics,
you choose.

00:56:11.985 --> 00:56:12.974
LAURA: Okay.

00:56:12.974 --> 00:56:16.688
MATT: Now it's going to go ahead and make
a bite attack against Jester, because

00:56:16.688 --> 00:56:20.740
you're the closest one to it. Since you're
restrained, it has advantage on the attack.

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:29.858
It's a natural 20 and a three. So natural 20
it is. So that's going to be-- Ooh, oh no.

00:56:31.428 --> 00:56:34.041
LAURA: If I go unconscious right away--

00:56:34.184 --> 00:56:35.928
SAM: It was a great game.

00:56:35.928 --> 00:56:38.228
LAURA: This was really fun, guys.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.147
TRAVIS: Stop rolling so many dice.

00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:42.844
LAURA: I went out doing what I love.

00:56:42.844 --> 00:56:44.428
SAM: Painting dicks?

00:56:44.428 --> 00:56:50.101
MATT: 34 points of piercing damage from
the critical hit, as its tendril pulls you

00:56:50.101 --> 00:56:55.088
in towards its mouth, shoves your shoulder
and the side of your neck into it, and it

00:56:55.088 --> 00:56:58.892
grinds down onto you. The armor pulls in
and you can feel it piercing the back of

00:56:58.892 --> 00:57:01.186
your neck. Sharp pain arcs through your body.

00:57:01.186 --> 00:57:02.307
LAURA: (pained noises)

00:57:02.307 --> 00:57:05.206
TRAVIS: Maybe we get the fuck out of here?
That was a big hit.

00:57:05.206 --> 00:57:08.579
MATT: This one here is going to go ahead
and go for Caleb for an attack.

00:57:08.579 --> 00:57:09.788
LIAM: Yeah.

00:57:09.788 --> 00:57:12.461
MATT: That's going to be a 14 to hit?

00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:13.466
LIAM: Shield.

00:57:13.466 --> 00:57:18.076
MATT: Shield. (whoosh) It actually almost grabs
you and in the last minute, you throw your hand up

00:57:18.076 --> 00:57:22.646
and an arcane barrier flashes in front and
the tentacle gets knocked off limply. Yes?

00:57:22.646 --> 00:57:24.342
LAURA: Can I use my Hellish Rebuke?

00:57:24.342 --> 00:57:25.464
MATT: Yes, you may.

00:57:25.464 --> 00:57:27.309
LAURA: Okay. Is it okay?

00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:28.867
MATT: Go for it.

00:57:28.867 --> 00:57:30.209
LAURA: Ah, okay, okay, okay!

00:57:30.209 --> 00:57:32.206
MATT: He's got three more tendril attacks.

00:57:32.206 --> 00:57:33.103
LAURA: Oh, god!

00:57:33.103 --> 00:57:34.087
TRAVIS: Three more?

00:57:34.087 --> 00:57:35.815
MATT: Each round they get four each.

00:57:35.815 --> 00:57:37.029
TALIESIN: And a bite.

00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.780
MATT: Yep.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:41.459
TRAVIS: How about they fought in the
last week and one of them is missing one?

00:57:41.459 --> 00:57:44.525
MATT: Haven't encountered adventurers
in a while, buddy!

00:57:44.525 --> 00:57:48.010
TRAVIS: Like sharks in the wild and
they've got battle damage, you know?

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.611
MATT: I admire your creativity.

00:57:49.611 --> 00:57:50.591
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:57:50.591 --> 00:57:51.950
LAURA: 3d10 damage.

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:55.428
MATT: 3d10 damage. As it bites into you,
you angrily focus--

00:57:55.428 --> 00:58:01.460
LAURA: (screams) Ooh, 19 points of cold damage.

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.038
MATT: And what's its save?

00:58:03.038 --> 00:58:05.549
LAURA: Oh, it's a dex save.

00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:07.469
MATT: Dex save. Haha, a two.

00:58:07.469 --> 00:58:09.144
LAURA: Yes!

00:58:09.144 --> 00:58:11.947
TALIESIN: The damage seems to take?

00:58:11.947 --> 00:58:16.100
MATT: The damage definitely takes.
(shattering) These ice crystals suddenly

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:21.117
apparate around its mouth where it bit into
Jester, and it seems to pull back a bit,

00:58:21.117 --> 00:58:25.322
its eye closes and winces with the impact.
Now its other attacks. Its second attack

00:58:25.322 --> 00:58:27.748
against you, Caleb. That's going to be
an 18 to hit.

00:58:27.748 --> 00:58:28.654
LIAM: Does not hit.

00:58:28.654 --> 00:58:30.372
MATT: Because the Shield's still up.

00:58:30.372 --> 00:58:31.103
LIAM: Yeah.

00:58:31.103 --> 00:58:32.674
MATT: Deflects the second attack.

00:58:32.674 --> 00:58:33.643
TALIESIN: Thank god.

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.693
MATT: Third one's going to go for Caduceus.

00:58:35.693 --> 00:58:37.074
TALIESIN: Is it close enough?

00:58:37.074 --> 00:58:39.274
MATT: It has a 50-foot range on its tendrils.

00:58:39.274 --> 00:58:42.727
(exclamations of shock)

00:58:42.727 --> 00:58:45.221
MATT: Reaches out. That's going to be a 21.

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:46.522
TALIESIN: That hits.

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:47.519
MATT: All right.

00:58:47.519 --> 00:58:49.567
TRAVIS: That's terrible!

00:58:49.567 --> 00:58:54.302
TALIESIN: Okay, good to know! No, this
is good. So we're not going to waste time

00:58:54.302 --> 00:58:56.548
trying to be safe from these things.

00:58:56.548 --> 00:58:59.023
MATT: Now you are also grappled.

00:58:59.023 --> 00:59:02.071
TALIESIN: Again, what does grappled mean?
It means I can't move--

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:06.157
MATT: Well, you are considered grappled, but
while you're grappled, you are restrained,

00:59:06.157 --> 00:59:09.686
which means you have disadvantage on
attacks. You also have disadvantage on

00:59:09.686 --> 00:59:11.730
strength checks and strength saving throws.

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:13.298
TALIESIN: Okay, and I can't move.

00:59:13.298 --> 00:59:15.294
MATT: You cannot move, your speed is zero.

00:59:15.294 --> 00:59:16.294
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:59:16.294 --> 00:59:20.859
MATT: Its fourth and final tendril, it's going to
go ahead and shoot for Caleb again. Natural 20.

00:59:20.859 --> 00:59:21.855
LIAM: That hits.

00:59:21.855 --> 00:59:24.050
TALIESIN: He's within 30 feet of me, isn't he?

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:25.146
MATT: Yeah.

00:59:25.146 --> 00:59:27.479
TALIESIN: All right, I'm canceling
the natural 20.

00:59:27.479 --> 00:59:29.712
MATT: Well it still hits, but it doesn't--

00:59:29.712 --> 00:59:32.076
TALIESIN: But the critical does not take.

00:59:32.076 --> 00:59:35.400
MATT: Right, it doesn't do any damage.
The tendril is just a--

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:39.361
TALIESIN: Oh it's not a damage-- Oh, never
mind. So it doesn't get anything special.

00:59:39.361 --> 00:59:42.883
MATT: Right, it gets one bite attack per
turn, but it grapples each of you.

00:59:42.883 --> 00:59:45.642
Just letting you know, you probably
want to hold onto that.

00:59:45.642 --> 00:59:48.932
TALIESIN: Okay, no, if it's not doing
anything, then there's no point.

00:59:48.932 --> 00:59:51.792
MARISHA: No, don't. Please stop, please stop,
don't touch me.

00:59:52.317 --> 00:59:54.969
TALIESIN: I am panicking, just a little.

00:59:55.018 --> 00:59:58.352
MATT: That's okay. You are also grappled
there, Caleb, and restrained.

00:59:58.352 --> 01:00:03.098
MARISHA: It was so pretty when we slept in a
geode. That was awesome. Remember that?

01:00:03.098 --> 01:00:04.248
TRAVIS: Yeah, draw that.

01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:07.971
TALIESIN: Is it time to start having the
flashbacks? Are we at flashback point?

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.354
MATT: It's going to use reel.

01:00:09.354 --> 01:00:13.421
TRAVIS: What do you mean "reel"?!
These attacks are real!

01:00:13.421 --> 01:00:16.617
MATT: Pulls Caduceus into it,
and Caleb into it.

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:21.839
TALIESIN: Okay, that's going to be interesting.

01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:25.063
SAM: I lose all the close men in my life!

01:00:25.063 --> 01:00:29.054
MATT: It's going to make an attack against
you. As you are restrained, attack rolls

01:00:29.054 --> 01:00:36.522
against you have advantage. A two and a one,
motherfuck. It goes towards to bite you,

01:00:36.522 --> 01:00:40.330
and the shield is still holding, and it's
pulling you in towards its mouth but

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:43.735
you see the barrier pressing and bits of
its rock exterior are cracking,

01:00:43.735 --> 01:00:46.604
being pressed up against this shield.

01:00:46.604 --> 01:00:50.176
LIAM: Caleb says: (whimpering apprehensively)

01:00:50.176 --> 01:00:53.957
MATT: All right, surprise round's done.
Top of the round, Beau, you're up first.

01:00:53.957 --> 01:00:59.355
MARISHA: Okay. Can I get closer to the roper?

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:03.118
MATT: You are currently grappled and
restrained. You have no movement.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:09.153
MARISHA: I was hoping he would do the reel
thing, but to me, because I'd love to get real.

01:01:09.153 --> 01:01:12.951
MATT: Well, technically, you are adjacent
to it, because you're both right there

01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:16.097
and it's in this space. You and
Jester are both adjacent to it.

01:01:16.097 --> 01:01:18.028
MARISHA: So I can hit it?

01:01:18.028 --> 01:01:21.948
MATT: Yes, you can hit it. Nott, it did not
reel you in that turn, because I forgot

01:01:21.948 --> 01:01:24.194
it can do the reel as part of its action.

01:01:24.194 --> 01:01:29.649
MARISHA: Well, I don't know what else
to do but to wail on this motherfucker.

01:01:30.212 --> 01:01:39.815
First attack is real bad; it's a natural two.
Next attack is not that much better, 20 total.

01:01:39.815 --> 01:01:43.882
MATT: Your attacks have disadvantage,
by the way, because you're restrained.

01:01:43.882 --> 01:01:49.132
MARISHA: Okay, then I will reroll that one
with a natural one. So that's cool.

01:01:49.132 --> 01:01:51.843
MATT: Miss. That two attacks so far?

01:01:51.843 --> 01:01:53.515
MARISHA: That's two attacks so far.

01:01:53.515 --> 01:01:57.524
MATT: The first attack, you can't quite get
your hand free. You manage to get it free

01:01:57.524 --> 01:02:03.209
for a second attack, and it hits the rock.
No impact. Still have your bonus action.

01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:05.832
SAM: She punched and it does nothing?

01:02:05.832 --> 01:02:07.274
MATT: She rolled low.

01:02:07.274 --> 01:02:12.047
MARISHA: I rolled a two then a one,
technically, but you roll disadvantage.

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.701
Does disengage count if you're grappled?

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:20.760
TRAVIS: I don't know what these things are!

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.496
MATT: You can disengage, but you still have no
movement. You have to escape from it to gain your

01:02:25.496 --> 01:02:29.778
movement speed back. Right now, you're wrapped
up by its tendril and you can't go anywhere.

01:02:29.778 --> 01:02:32.565
MARISHA: So disengage wouldn't help me
escape from it?

01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:36.143
MATT: No. Disengage prevents attacks of
opportunity, but you cannot get away

01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:37.474
from it to even trigger one.

01:02:39.954 --> 01:02:42.619
TRAVIS: Could you use your action,
if she hadn't already?

01:02:42.619 --> 01:02:46.174
MATT: Fjord, you're on deck, with Yasha
after that. You can use your action

01:02:46.174 --> 01:02:48.490
to try and break free, yeah.

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:58.379
MARISHA: But I already used my action to
attack, so I might as well Flurry of Blows.

01:02:58.379 --> 01:03:02.514
MATT: There you go. Flurry of Blows, get two
more strikes on it, each with disadvantage.

01:03:02.514 --> 01:03:08.323
MARISHA: Disadvantage on the first one.
Nope, that's a two again, second one is

01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:13.437
a natural 20 and a 12, bringing me
to a 20 total.

01:03:13.437 --> 01:03:18.597
MATT: 20 just hits. The first one doesn't
even get out, the second one hits the rock

01:03:18.597 --> 01:03:22.913
and hurts. You get your other arm free and
(impacts) into the stone again. This time

01:03:22.913 --> 01:03:25.893
you look down as the eye opens up and you
see the eye and go (whack) right into the

01:03:25.893 --> 01:03:30.316
center of its giant glowing eye.
Roll damage on that one.

01:03:30.316 --> 01:03:38.518
MARISHA: It's terrible. Two! Seven damage.
I turn to everyone and go:

01:03:38.518 --> 01:03:41.250
I think I broke my wrist. Then that's it.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.162
MATT: That's the end of your turn?

01:03:43.162 --> 01:03:44.740
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.672
MATT: Cool. That brings us to Fjord.

01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:54.419
TRAVIS: I'll use my 30 feet and I will come around
that cover and I will run down to the--

01:03:54.419 --> 01:03:58.357
MARISHA: Can I do the thing? No, I have
to hit twice. Never mind, nope.

01:03:58.357 --> 01:04:01.645
MATT: You can do stunning strike if you
want to, but that's up to you.

01:04:01.645 --> 01:04:04.294
MARISHA: Oh! Can I do that?

01:04:04.294 --> 01:04:08.350
MATT: Yeah, even when you attack on your
Flurry of Blows, as long as you hit with

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:09.681
an attack, you can do that.

01:04:09.681 --> 01:04:11.021
MARISHA: Stunning strike!

01:04:11.058 --> 01:04:16.169
MATT: All right, spend another ki point.
Constitution save, it's a natural one.

01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:20.337
Motherfuck.

01:04:20.709 --> 01:04:26.995
MARISHA: (fake crying) There is a god.
Okay, that's my turn.

01:04:26.995 --> 01:04:29.081
LIAM: And she's smiling on you.

01:04:29.081 --> 01:04:32.608
MARISHA: Yes, she is.

01:04:32.608 --> 01:04:37.703
MATT: We'll take this stunned token
and put it on this one.

01:04:38.643 --> 01:04:39.877
TRAVIS: That is a lot.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:42.347
LAURA: What is that other purple thing on him?

01:04:42.347 --> 01:04:43.383
MATT: That's Hex.

01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:44.360
LAURA: He's hexed?

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.209
MATT: Correct. Now, Fjord, you can take
your turn. As you take your turn, you look

01:04:48.209 --> 01:04:54.446
over and watch as Beau plunges her fist into
the eye of this living stalagmite and it

01:04:54.446 --> 01:04:59.993
starts suddenly wriggling in place.
It looks like it's having a rough time.

01:04:59.993 --> 01:05:04.311
TRAVIS: Amazing. I will run up and take
two swings with the Summer's Dance

01:05:04.311 --> 01:05:07.379
falchion against the stunned...

01:05:07.379 --> 01:05:10.660
MATT: Your attacks have advantage on it
because it is stunned, yes.

01:05:10.872 --> 01:05:15.597
TRAVIS: That's amazing, okay.
That is a 29 to hit.

01:05:15.597 --> 01:05:17.017
MATT: That hits.

01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:20.961
TRAVIS: The second one is not as great.
That is only a 19. Misses.

01:05:20.961 --> 01:05:25.429
MATT: Got you. 19 just barely misses,
unfortunately.

01:05:25.429 --> 01:05:39.028
TRAVIS: Yeah. All right. Eight, 12-- oh,
1d6 for Hex. 15 points of slashing damage.

01:05:39.028 --> 01:05:44.421
MATT: You rush up with one attack, carve
across with the scimitar, and you expect it

01:05:44.534 --> 01:05:48.489
to completely deflect the blow, but the blade
does cut through the rock. Where it splits

01:05:48.489 --> 01:05:53.594
where the blade was, there is a muscly,
fleshy interior. The creature is heavily

01:05:53.594 --> 01:05:58.847
armored by the shell it's created around
itself, but it's definitely mortal. Your

01:05:58.847 --> 01:06:03.902
second strike, however, glides against the 
outside of its rocky shell and makes no damage.

01:06:03.902 --> 01:06:08.080
TRAVIS: I am going to use my bonus action
and use Misty Step on the falchion

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.625
to bamf back up on the platform.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.559
MATT: All right. Right there?

01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:15.285
TRAVIS: Yep. And that is my turn.

01:06:17.331 --> 01:06:21.141
MATT: I would say, because you can only
Misty Step to places you can see, you can

01:06:21.141 --> 01:06:24.756
go there, but you have five feet of
movement left, so you move there anyways.

01:06:24.756 --> 01:06:27.802
Just as a point of reference. That ends
Fjord's turn. Yasha's up.

01:06:27.802 --> 01:06:33.622
TRAVIS: Yasha would like to rage. She will
rush the traffic cone from hell that is

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:41.209
attacking Caduceus and Caleb and take two
strikes with her Magician's Judge.

01:06:41.209 --> 01:06:42.531
MATT: Go for it.

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:45.954
TRAVIS: Reckless attacks, please.

01:06:46.107 --> 01:06:47.533
MATT: All righty.

01:06:48.762 --> 01:06:58.115
That is a natural 20 for the first one,
and the second one is only a ten.

01:06:58.115 --> 01:07:03.260
MATT: That first hit, all the impact and
might smashes into this creature's face,

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.558
and she pulls back and, "That's all I had."

01:07:06.619 --> 01:07:19.847
TRAVIS: I love barbarians so much.
(counting) 13 times three is 39, right?

01:07:19.847 --> 01:07:22.533
Yeah, 39 points of slashing damage.

01:07:22.533 --> 01:07:23.856
MATT: Times two, you mean?

01:07:23.856 --> 01:07:30.097
TRAVIS: Oh, times two, sorry, 26.
Not times three, times two. 26.

01:07:30.097 --> 01:07:32.174
MATT: Any bonuses on top of that?

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:39.080
TRAVIS: That's it, yeah. Oh no, sorry,
rage is three. 29.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:44.654
MATT: 29 points of damage from that first strike
as the Magician's Judge carves down through it.

01:07:44.654 --> 01:07:48.869
One of the tentacles gets damaged and you can
see it still holding tight, but starting to wear

01:07:48.869 --> 01:07:52.657
this thing down. Still looking okay,
though. That finishes Yasha's turn?

01:07:52.657 --> 01:07:53.398
TRAVIS: It does.

01:07:53.398 --> 01:07:56.296
LIAM: Is that all the 12s? Is that all the
12s in a row?

01:07:56.296 --> 01:08:00.811
MATT: They're after the ropers. They're right
before you guys. They're squeezed right between

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:17.687
Yasha and your trio's turn. This one here is
going to reel in Nott. Now you get pulled.

01:08:17.687 --> 01:08:20.324
SAM: Wait, they can do that even though
they're stunned?

01:08:20.324 --> 01:08:26.529
MATT: Oh, that one's stunned, so it can't. Never
mind. That one right there is going to attempt to

01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:34.045
ensnare, with one of its free tendrils,
Yasha. That is going to be a 15 to hit?

01:08:34.045 --> 01:08:35.129
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:08:35.129 --> 01:08:40.060
MATT: It hits! She is also now grappled
and restrained. It's going to make

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.825
a bite attack against Caleb.

01:08:42.825 --> 01:08:45.902
TRAVIS: So hitting it doesn't make them
drop the grapple.

01:08:45.902 --> 01:08:47.298
MATT: You have to break free.

01:08:47.298 --> 01:08:49.102
TRAVIS: I was hoping that would be the case.

01:08:49.102 --> 01:08:50.523
MATT: That's another natural 20!

01:08:50.523 --> 01:08:51.544
TALIESIN: Cancelled.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:57.827
MATT: Reaction from Caduceus to-- what's
the ability called again? Channel Divinity?

01:08:57.827 --> 01:09:04.773
TALIESIN: It's actually not a Channel Divinity.
It's called "Sentinel at Death's Door."

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:07.033
MATT: Was it once per short rest?

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:09.246
TALIESIN: No, it's five times per long rest.

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:11.748
LAURA and SAM: Five times?!

01:09:11.748 --> 01:09:14.723
TALIESIN: As long as I'm "within 30 feet of
somebody who suffers a critical hit, you can

01:09:14.723 --> 01:09:17.985
"turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effect
triggered by the critical hit is canceled."

01:09:18.051 --> 01:09:20.080
MATT: Grave clerics, man. That's awesome.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.383
TALIESIN: Five times per long rest.

01:09:21.383 --> 01:09:30.213
MATT: Well, be thankful he reduced
that critical. 28 points of piercing damage

01:09:30.213 --> 01:09:38.722
as it jams your entire arm into its mouth
and it's starting to pull you in from the

01:09:38.722 --> 01:09:46.058
torso up. The other one is stunned and does
not get its turn. That brings us to the trio.

01:09:46.058 --> 01:09:50.477
LIAM: One handed, Caleb gets the molasses
out and starts smearing it and casting--

01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:51.879
TALIESIN: Wait, should I--

01:09:51.879 --> 01:09:53.575
MATT: He's already going. He's already on it.

01:09:53.575 --> 01:09:57.395
LIAM: I'm going, too late, and I cast Slow
on both of them.

01:09:57.395 --> 01:09:59.212
MATT: What's the save?

01:09:59.212 --> 01:10:00.396
LIAM: 16.

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:02.139
MATT: What is it, wisdom?

01:10:02.139 --> 01:10:04.330
LIAM: Wisdom, yeah.

01:10:05.073 --> 01:10:08.548
MATT: This is for the guy over there.
14. He is slowed.

01:10:08.548 --> 01:10:14.994
LIAM: He can do one thing per round now,
while that's up. Yeah, it just brought all

01:10:14.994 --> 01:10:17.720
those tentacles down to one thing per round.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.581
MATT: That guy is a 15.

01:10:20.581 --> 01:10:21.542
LIAM: Fails.

01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:22.811
MATT: They're both slowed.

01:10:22.811 --> 01:10:25.405
TALIESIN: Okay. It's about to get worse
for them.

01:10:25.405 --> 01:10:27.499
TRAVIS: Those circles are so great.

01:10:27.499 --> 01:10:30.476
MATT: Yeah, a fan sent those, actually.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:35.441
LIAM: A negative two penalty to AC and
dexterity saving throws. Can't use reactions.

01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:38.664
It can use either an action or a
bonus action, not both.

01:10:38.664 --> 01:10:42.170
MATT: You've got it. Caleb, that's your go.

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:44.941
LIAM: (pained yelling)

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:49.726
MATT: Casting frantically with the off-hand.
Their whipping tendrils that are wrapping

01:10:49.726 --> 01:10:55.754
you all of a sudden go (slow-down sound).
Its chewing on Caleb is like (slow grinding).

01:10:55.754 --> 01:10:59.851
LIAM: I'm getting the molasses everywhere!

01:10:59.851 --> 01:11:05.032
MATT: Jester's still part way in, like,
"Oh, god!" Slow chews. Nott or Caduceus.

01:11:05.032 --> 01:11:08.832
TALIESIN: I'll take it. Slow down, cowboy.
I'm casting Bane on these two.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.883
MATT: What's the save?

01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:13.084
TALIESIN: The save is a 16 charisma.

01:11:13.084 --> 01:11:15.008
MATT: Charisma? Oh, they are <i>not</i> charismatic.

01:11:15.008 --> 01:11:17.050
TALIESIN: Yep. I didn't think they would be.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:21.412
MATT: There is a 12 and a zero.

01:11:21.412 --> 01:11:27.914
TALIESIN: That means that you have to take a
negative d4 to attack rolls and saving throws.

01:11:27.987 --> 01:11:29.508
MATT: Yeah, you've got it.

01:11:29.508 --> 01:11:32.664
TALIESIN: On both of them. I'm going to
then spend my bonus action, and

01:11:32.664 --> 01:11:41.263
I'm going to call a swarm of insects. I'm
going to drop it on the-- let's get one of

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:44.412
these out of the way first. Let's get the
one that's far away from me.

01:11:44.412 --> 01:11:48.943
I'm going to drop it right on him. That
swarm of insects is going to take a bite.

01:11:48.943 --> 01:11:54.007
MATT: Caduceus is pulled in, manages to
curse them both with this divine power

01:11:54.007 --> 01:12:01.642
pulled from the Wildmother's darker side of
nature, and then holds the staff up through.

01:12:01.642 --> 01:12:07.021
A burst of insects, beetles, then fly out
of it, clouding around this central

01:12:07.021 --> 01:12:11.364
stalagmite, and begin to assault
the opposite side of the creature.

01:12:11.364 --> 01:12:13.987
TALIESIN: Hard to hit. Let's see if I can
actually hit because my to-hit is--

01:12:13.987 --> 01:12:15.598
MATT: It is still stunned, so you have
advantage on your attack.

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:17.464
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's exciting.

01:12:17.464 --> 01:12:21.595
MATT: It's stunned until Beau's next turn.

01:12:21.595 --> 01:12:23.387
TALIESIN: 18 is the highest hit.

01:12:23.387 --> 01:12:26.848
MATT: 18 just hits because of the Slow
spell. Their AC is reduced by two.

01:12:26.848 --> 01:12:34.448
TALIESIN: This is a bite attack, which is
4d4. Hit ten, 4d4 piercing damage?

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:37.396
It's ten plus 4d4, I believe?

01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:39.441
MATT: No, it's just 4d4.

01:12:39.441 --> 01:12:41.496
TALIESIN: Why does it say ten?
I don't know.

01:12:41.496 --> 01:12:43.516
MATT: Ten is the average damage.

01:12:43.516 --> 01:12:48.811
TALIESIN: Oh. (counting) That's ten.

01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:52.817
MATT: Ten points of damage. The beetles are
now biting into the side of this entity.

01:12:52.817 --> 01:12:54.077
That finish your turn?

01:12:54.077 --> 01:12:56.118
TALIESIN: That finishes my turn.

01:12:56.118 --> 01:13:02.278
SAM: I will not try to leave the grapple.
Instead, I will fire a crossbow bolt

01:13:02.355 --> 01:13:05.436
at this one that has me grappled.

01:13:05.436 --> 01:13:06.452
MATT: You've got it.

01:13:06.452 --> 01:13:08.136
SAM: With advantage, because it's stunned?

01:13:08.136 --> 01:13:09.965
MATT: It is stunned, yes.

01:13:09.965 --> 01:13:13.204
SAM: Oh, not good. Both of them not good. 15.

01:13:13.204 --> 01:13:19.158
MATT: 15 misses. It ricochets off of its
rock-like hide. The bolt goes scattering

01:13:19.158 --> 01:13:20.339
off into the shadows somewhere.

01:13:20.339 --> 01:13:21.789
SAM: Bonus action, fire again.

01:13:21.789 --> 01:13:22.835
MATT: Go for it.

01:13:22.835 --> 01:13:24.536
TRAVIS: Tentacles made of rock as well?

01:13:24.536 --> 01:13:27.447
MATT: They appear to be of similar material.
They have a similar look to them,

01:13:27.447 --> 01:13:30.268
but they're flexible, so they're
probably not as--

01:13:30.268 --> 01:13:31.489
SAM: 28.

01:13:31.489 --> 01:13:35.067
MATT: 28 does hit, and it is adjacent--
well, it's stunned anyway,

01:13:35.071 --> 01:13:37.340
so you do get your sneak attack damage on it.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.925
SAM: Yeah!

01:13:38.925 --> 01:13:40.139
MATT: All the dice.

01:13:40.139 --> 01:13:41.085
LAURA: Woo!

01:13:41.085 --> 01:13:51.488
SAM: Oh, there's a couple ones. Okay, 22.
Plus I'll do Fury of the Small;

01:13:51.488 --> 01:13:53.567
that's another eight. That's
30 points of damage.

01:13:53.567 --> 01:13:55.007
TRAVIS: Boom!

01:13:55.007 --> 01:14:00.111
MATT: 30 points of damage, nice. As the first bolt
ricochets, you see a spark as the rock-like

01:14:00.111 --> 01:14:05.197
exterior shoots it off. As it's sitting there
(groaning) with its one eye open, its jaw still

01:14:05.197 --> 01:14:10.429
chewing on Jester. Jester manages to wedge herself
out of its mouth just in time for you to aim the

01:14:10.429 --> 01:14:17.528
bolt into its throat. It begins to cough a bit
of its own blood. It's looking pretty hurt.

01:14:17.528 --> 01:14:19.227
SAM: Good, good.

01:14:19.227 --> 01:14:20.484
MATT: That ends your turn, Nott?

01:14:20.484 --> 01:14:21.337
SAM: That's all I've got.

01:14:21.337 --> 01:14:22.450
MATT: Jester, you're up.

01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:31.403
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to turn, since that one's
letting me go, and I'm going to put my hand

01:14:31.427 --> 01:14:37.420
towards the other one. I'll say: Get the fuck out
of my temple! I'm going to cast Banishment.

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.421
MATT: Oh, shit!

01:14:39.421 --> 01:14:42.937
SAM: Banishment?! What!

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.699
LAURA: Yeah. That's a charisma save.

01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:47.067
TRAVIS: Good call.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:51.521
MATT: It rolled a natural 16, minus two.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:54.572
(cheering)

01:14:54.572 --> 01:14:56.624
LAURA: It needed a 16 save, so--

01:14:56.624 --> 01:15:03.342
MATT: This guy vanishes. The tendrils are no
longer around you, so none of them are--

01:15:03.342 --> 01:15:06.617
TRAVIS: Thank god he didn't take anybody
with him.

01:15:06.617 --> 01:15:09.098
LAURA: Well, he wouldn't have done that here.

01:15:09.098 --> 01:15:13.774
MATT: You're all of a sudden released from it,
and the creature's just not there anymore.

01:15:13.774 --> 01:15:16.776
LAURA: He'll only be gone for a little bit.
We should probably get out of here.

01:15:16.776 --> 01:15:20.518
Also, kill this guy, huh? Then I turn back
to the dude that's in front of me.

01:15:20.518 --> 01:15:22.537
MATT: Right, because you're still
wrapped up by its tendrils.

01:15:22.537 --> 01:15:27.258
LAURA: Yeah. I can't do anything else,
I don't think. Yeah, that's all I can do.

01:15:27.258 --> 01:15:28.824
MATT: Beau, you're up.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:31.661
MARISHA: Ah! Doo-bah!

01:15:33.084 --> 01:15:35.613
MATT: It is stunned until the end of your
next turn, I believe, right?

01:15:35.694 --> 01:15:37.369
MARISHA: That's the way it works.

01:15:37.369 --> 01:15:40.328
MATT: You still have advantage on the
attacks. You have disadvantage

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:43.324
because you're restrained, so it's just
a straight roll for you.

01:15:43.324 --> 01:15:44.429
MARISHA: I'm still restrained.

01:15:44.429 --> 01:15:46.172
TRAVIS: That Cobalt fighting style. Doo-bah!

01:15:46.172 --> 01:15:52.372
MARISHA: I'm going to stir around my stick
and try and jab it into his eyeball.

01:15:52.372 --> 01:15:53.602
MATT: Go for it.

01:15:53.602 --> 01:15:55.198
MARISHA: Wait, straight roll?

01:15:55.198 --> 01:15:56.937
TRAVIS: Yeah, straight roll.

01:15:56.937 --> 01:16:01.144
MARISHA: I'm going to get rid of all those.
It never happened. I don't think it worked,

01:16:01.144 --> 01:16:04.372
nope. That's a 14?

01:16:04.372 --> 01:16:09.118
MATT: 14 misses. You're punching a rock,
and it's hurting,

01:16:09.187 --> 01:16:11.567
but you're going to get through.
Looking for those soft spots.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.858
MARISHA: Second attack.

01:16:13.858 --> 01:16:16.076
LIAM: Ooh, it was almost a one,
and then it was better.

01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:18.483
MARISHA: Now it's a 19, so it definitely hits.

01:16:18.483 --> 01:16:19.919
MATT: Yes, that hits.

01:16:19.919 --> 01:16:28.368
MARISHA: That was with my staff I said,
so it's a d8. Seven points of damage.

01:16:28.368 --> 01:16:29.866
MATT: Seven points of damage.

01:16:29.866 --> 01:16:35.163
MARISHA: I'm going to re-stun it. Can I
do that? Stunning strike.

01:16:35.163 --> 01:16:39.959
MATT: That is an 18, so it resists it.

01:16:39.959 --> 01:16:42.142
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to move on from that.

01:16:42.142 --> 01:16:47.201
TALIESIN: The d4! Wait, and also, is there
anything else he gets from Slow for saving throws?

01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:50.125
LIAM: Negative two AC and dex saves.

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:53.499
MATT: That's minus two to it, so it's a 16.
What's your DC?

01:16:53.499 --> 01:16:55.012
MARISHA: 14.

01:16:55.012 --> 01:16:56.741
MATT: Yeah, so it resists it.

01:16:56.741 --> 01:17:02.460
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows! Wait, why do I
keep rolling twice? I keep thinking

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:10.415
I need to roll twice. Just once. Ah!
Natural 20! It's so manic, but it's true.

01:17:10.415 --> 01:17:11.570
MATT: I saw it.

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:16.977
MARISHA: Doubling the dice. That's a three
plus a six, so that's 11.

01:17:16.977 --> 01:17:22.281
MATT: 11 points of damage on that strike. As
you jam the staff into the middle of its mouth

01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:26.469
and are prying it open, you get down and
see where its eye is trying to keep closed,

01:17:26.469 --> 01:17:31.231
and the moment it flicks open to be aware of
its surroundings, you whack, poking it right there.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:36.202
MARISHA: Going for the uvula. Last one. 18.

01:17:36.202 --> 01:17:38.670
MATT: 18 just hits, because of the Slow spell.

01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:43.052
MARISHA: For this one, I'm going to try and
grab onto its tongue, because I know,

01:17:43.052 --> 01:17:52.369
lot of blood vessels in the tongue, and
start trying to rip it. Another 11 damage.

01:17:52.369 --> 01:17:56.979
MATT: 11 points of damage. Oof, this thing
is not having a great moment.

01:17:56.979 --> 01:17:59.443
MARISHA: I say: Drop it! Drop it!

01:17:59.443 --> 01:18:02.212
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

01:18:02.212 --> 01:18:06.532
TRAVIS: I'll run back up and take two
swipes with the Summer's Dance falchion.

01:18:06.532 --> 01:18:09.296
LAURA: I really hope you guys kill it
before it gets back to its turn.

01:18:09.296 --> 01:18:16.144
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too. First one is a 28,
and the second one is a 29.

01:18:16.144 --> 01:18:21.996
MATT: Both hit. Damn, nice. It is no
longer stunned. Actually, did you roll

01:18:21.996 --> 01:18:24.107
with advantage, or did you roll regularly?

01:18:24.107 --> 01:18:24.954
TRAVIS: Just straight.

01:18:24.954 --> 01:18:27.298
MATT: Good. It's no longer stunned, so you
do not have advantage on the attack.

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:33.951
TRAVIS: Nice. Ten plus four is 14 points
of slashing damage, with four points

01:18:33.951 --> 01:18:41.484
of necrotic in there from the Hex. The
second one is eight plus six, 14,

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:46.727
plus five points of necrotic
for 19 points of damage.

01:18:46.727 --> 01:18:48.038
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:18:48.038 --> 01:18:50.390
(cheering)

01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:58.329
TRAVIS: Like a hero, I run up behind it and take
inspiration from Beau, and I go (whoosh).

01:18:58.329 --> 01:18:59.870
Doo-bah!

01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:06.351
MATT: You see Fjord holding the pose there
for a second, as Beau's holding its tongue,

01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:11.588
and the tongue comes out. You look past
and watch as its eye goes limp,

01:19:11.588 --> 01:19:15.371
and it shifts off into three separate pieces.

01:19:15.371 --> 01:19:17.827
LAURA: Hi, Fjord! Thank you.

01:19:17.827 --> 01:19:19.061
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

01:19:19.061 --> 01:19:20.574
LAURA: We should leave.

01:19:20.574 --> 01:19:22.574
TALIESIN: How long does that thing stay--?

01:19:22.574 --> 01:19:25.717
LAURA: Not long at all. Like probably
another minute or so, so run?

01:19:25.717 --> 01:19:26.673
SAM: Okay, let's go.

01:19:26.673 --> 01:19:29.549
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's book. Wait, who's--
yeah, we'll heal on the way.

01:19:29.549 --> 01:19:31.011
MATT: You guys book it.

01:19:31.011 --> 01:19:32.679
SAM: Do we need to loot the bodies?

01:19:32.679 --> 01:19:34.208
LAURA: There's not-- it's rocks.

01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:37.883
TRAVIS: Actually, Yasha will run up to
Caleb as we're running, and she will do

01:19:37.883 --> 01:19:41.601
Healing Touch because she never does that
shit, to Caleb, and put-- what is it?

01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:49.206
Healing Hands, healing seven points.
She never wastes an action on that.

01:19:49.206 --> 01:19:50.588
SAM: Ropers.

01:19:50.588 --> 01:19:53.123
MATT: Ropers, man.

01:19:53.123 --> 01:19:54.843
TRAVIS: Is that what they're called?

01:19:54.843 --> 01:19:55.546
MATT: Yep.

01:19:55.546 --> 01:19:59.042
LIAM: We're on the move, <i>ja</i>?
Hup, hup, hup.

01:19:59.042 --> 01:20:04.142
MARISHA: Caleb, do you have any use
for this? Nott? Nott.

01:20:04.142 --> 01:20:05.547
SAM: What's that? A tongue?

01:20:05.547 --> 01:20:06.613
MARISHA: Roper tongue.

01:20:06.613 --> 01:20:07.880
SAM: Yeah, I'll take that.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.258
MATT: You can add a roper tongue to your
inventory.

01:20:10.258 --> 01:20:11.180
SAM: To my belly.

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.651
MATT: There you go. That's the other inventory.

01:20:14.881 --> 01:20:16.359
LAURA: It's like beef jerky?

01:20:16.359 --> 01:20:17.921
MATT: It's pretty tough.

01:20:17.921 --> 01:20:19.135
TRAVIS: Like octopus.

01:20:19.135 --> 01:20:25.970
MATT: Strangely salty. It's the minerals.
As you guys are rushing up around the edge,

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:32.295
the cavern ends about another 50 or 60 feet
up front. It just ends.

01:20:32.295 --> 01:20:33.355
MARISHA: What?

01:20:33.355 --> 01:20:34.879
SAM: This is not the right way.

01:20:34.879 --> 01:20:38.265
TRAVIS: Oh. Let's go back and check that water.

01:20:38.265 --> 01:20:40.490
SAM: But if we go back the thing will be back.

01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:43.596
TALIESIN: Why don't we all prepare?
I haven't put my insects away,

01:20:43.596 --> 01:20:45.695
and we can just kill this thing off, really.

01:20:45.695 --> 01:20:47.501
MATT: Jester, make a perception check.

01:20:47.501 --> 01:20:52.735
TALIESIN: I still have a swarm of insects.
I'm, for the moment,

01:20:52.735 --> 01:20:55.290
going to keep my insects down there,
just in case.

01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:57.048
LAURA: 12.

01:20:57.048 --> 01:21:06.728
MATT: You're looking around, and the tracks
that you noticed earlier, you guys pick up on,

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:13.463
and you see that it is still traveling this
direction. You can glance at the area,

01:21:13.463 --> 01:21:18.420
though the wall itself is this surface of
loose rock and stone formations there.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:22.130
TRAVIS: Can I walk up and touch it, and
see if any of it moves or is different?

01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:25.844
MATT: Following the tracks, there is an
area where it looks like the stones are

01:21:25.844 --> 01:21:29.129
just loosely there. Part of the wall fell
in and covered the interior,

01:21:29.129 --> 01:21:30.751
but you can pull stones out of it.

01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:32.469
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll start doing that.

01:21:32.469 --> 01:21:35.843
LIAM: I'm going to keep my eyes behind us
where we just ran away from.

01:21:35.843 --> 01:21:37.413
LAURA: Yeah, same, I'm going too.

01:21:37.413 --> 01:21:41.268
MATT: Okay, so you start pulling stones
out and passing them off. Some of them are

01:21:41.268 --> 01:21:45.164
pretty heavy. Yasha is helping. You guys
are pulling them out one by one. You get a

01:21:45.164 --> 01:21:49.066
small section of opening available to you.
It wasn't a huge collapse. It looks like

01:21:49.066 --> 01:21:53.012
when it was passing through, it might have
bumped into the wall and caused a portion

01:21:53.012 --> 01:21:57.061
of it to fall in, and it's only the lack of
light in here that's really making it hard

01:21:57.061 --> 01:22:00.535
to originally even notice this exit.
You get halfway through it before you

01:22:00.535 --> 01:22:02.293
hear (whoosh) in the room behind you.

01:22:02.293 --> 01:22:03.675
SAM and LAURA: Oh, it's back.

01:22:03.675 --> 01:22:06.049
TALIESIN: Is it back to exactly
where it was before?

01:22:06.049 --> 01:22:06.757
MATT: Yes.

01:22:06.757 --> 01:22:09.328
TALIESIN: It's immediately attacked
by an insect swarm.

01:22:09.328 --> 01:22:13.572
MATT: Go for it. It moves very slow. You
glance back in the area and it goes (squelching).

01:22:13.572 --> 01:22:17.485
It moves ten feet a round, and you're about
a hundred feet from it around that way.

01:22:17.485 --> 01:22:19.489
LAURA: Good. But it's got a 50-foot reach!

01:22:19.489 --> 01:22:20.211
TALIESIN: 22.

01:22:20.211 --> 01:22:23.930
MATT: It'll be about another minute before
it gets within range. 22? That hits!

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:27.754
Technically, it's still-- No, it's not slowed
anymore, because Slow has worn off.

01:22:27.754 --> 01:22:30.128
LIAM: It's a minute duration.

01:22:30.128 --> 01:22:32.270
MATT: Right, it's been banished for a minute.

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:36.174
LIAM: Okay. Magic Missiles.

01:22:36.174 --> 01:22:37.534
MATT: (laughing) Go for it!

01:22:37.534 --> 01:22:39.868
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's right. We can
shoot at it.

01:22:39.878 --> 01:22:44.206
MATT: You can still attack from a distance. It's
about a hundred, now it's 90 feet from you.

01:22:44.206 --> 01:22:45.657
TALIESIN: Ten points of damage.

01:22:45.657 --> 01:22:48.895
TRAVIS: I'll do the same thing. I'll throw
some Eldritch Blast at it.

01:22:48.895 --> 01:22:49.661
MATT: Go for it.

01:22:49.661 --> 01:22:51.284
MARISHA: I'm still throwing rocks.

01:22:51.284 --> 01:22:52.475
SAM: I'll shoot an arrow.

01:22:52.475 --> 01:22:55.443
MATT: Yasha and Beau are moving rocks.
Make an athletics check for me.

01:22:55.443 --> 01:22:57.846
Make an athletics check for Yasha.
Yeah, she's good.

01:22:57.846 --> 01:22:58.706
MARISHA: Fuck. 11.

01:22:58.706 --> 01:23:00.517
TRAVIS: I'll move my Hex over onto it.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:01.264
SAM: 28.

01:23:01.264 --> 01:23:01.975
MATT: 28 hits.

01:23:01.975 --> 01:23:04.446
TALIESIN: I'm also going to throw
Sacred Flame at it.

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:06.589
LAURA: It's not within range of Sacred Flame.

01:23:06.589 --> 01:23:08.222
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it is 60 feet.

01:23:08.222 --> 01:23:10.604
MATT: It's not in range yet. It's 90 feet
from you.

01:23:10.604 --> 01:23:12.364
TRAVIS: 16 points of Eldritch damage.

01:23:12.364 --> 01:23:15.060
SAM: 12 points of bolt damage.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.459
LAURA: Guiding Bolt!

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:18.211
MATT: Roll for attack.

01:23:18.211 --> 01:23:24.580
SAM: Oh no, it's getting closer. I back up
a little. Another five feet.

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:28.243
MATT: All right, that's as far as you can get.
You're up against the wall now.

01:23:28.243 --> 01:23:31.288
LAURA: 13 points. Oh wait, I didn't roll
to attack. I'm an idiot.

01:23:31.288 --> 01:23:33.148
MATT: You have to roll attack for that.

01:23:33.148 --> 01:23:34.854
LAURA: Oh, that definitely hits.
19 plus eight.

01:23:34.854 --> 01:23:35.844
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.293
LAURA: So that was 13 points.

01:23:37.293 --> 01:23:40.626
MATT: 13 points of radiant damage, and
it's also glowing. The next attack on it

01:23:40.626 --> 01:23:43.728
has advantage. It moves forward again.
It is now 70 feet from you.

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:48.397
LIAM: I said Magic Missiles, but I don't have that
prepared, so I'm going to throw Fire Bolt at it.

01:23:48.397 --> 01:23:49.184
MATT: Go for it.

01:23:49.184 --> 01:23:50.158
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.114
MARISHA: Kill it with cantrips.

01:23:52.114 --> 01:23:54.048
MATT: That's the way to do it.

01:23:54.048 --> 01:23:55.687
TRAVIS: One of those hits. 21.

01:23:55.687 --> 01:23:57.096
LIAM: 18 for me.

01:23:57.096 --> 01:23:58.861
MATT: 21 damage for you? 18 from you?

01:23:58.861 --> 01:24:00.244
TRAVIS: No, sorry, 21 to hit.

01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:01.917
MATT: 21 hits, yeah. And 18 damage.

01:24:01.917 --> 01:24:02.779
LIAM: 18 total.

01:24:02.779 --> 01:24:09.562
MATT: All right. It's taking hits and
slowly moving towards you. It feels like

01:24:09.562 --> 01:24:15.249
the old 1950s sci-fi movie with the weird
carrot looking creatures that these are

01:24:15.249 --> 01:24:19.903
loosely based on visually? This is like a
dude in a suit, trying to scoot it forward.

01:24:19.903 --> 01:24:23.571
They don't chase very well, ropers.

01:24:23.571 --> 01:24:29.009
SAM: I'm going to carefully aim and
fire a gun at it. My pistol.

01:24:29.009 --> 01:24:30.055
MATT: Okay, go for it!

01:24:30.055 --> 01:24:32.870
TRAVIS: Before he fires, 19 points
of damage, four necrotic.

01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:34.302
MATT: You got it.

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.260
LIAM: Say goodnight, Grimace.

01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:41.740
SAM: It is disadvantage because it's longer
than 30 feet away, right?

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.163
MATT: But it's advantage because the--
well, no, because you already used

01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:46.643
the Guiding Bolt. That's right.

01:24:46.643 --> 01:24:52.198
SAM: So it would be not great. 13.

01:24:52.198 --> 01:24:59.178
MATT: There's a burst of powder and smoke.
You've never fired a firearm. It's still a

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:03.469
relatively new technology for most people
outside of the main military, and even then,

01:25:03.469 --> 01:25:07.628
they've only been producing them out of
Hupperdook for the past ten years. So your

01:25:07.628 --> 01:25:11.387
first time really using this, and yeah,
the ringing's in your ears, your hand

01:25:11.387 --> 01:25:19.437
feels numb from the blowback. Not great.
It (pings) off of the front of it.

01:25:19.437 --> 01:25:23.316
TRAVIS: I don't know what that is, but
I don't think you should use it no more.

01:25:23.316 --> 01:25:25.124
SAM: Reload!

01:25:25.426 --> 01:25:28.203
LAURA: Is it within 60 feet of us yet?

01:25:28.203 --> 01:25:31.100
TALIESIN: When do the insects get another
attack? Thank you.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.892
MATT: Now it's 60 feet.

01:25:33.892 --> 01:25:36.431
LAURA: Toll the Dead! Bong!

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:38.280
MATT: A natural 20 on its save.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.228
LIAM: Everybody's in a line, shaking their
heads at this thing.

01:25:41.228 --> 01:25:43.426
TRAVIS: Two more Eldritch Blasts.
Ooh, natural 20!

01:25:43.426 --> 01:25:46.452
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying. Oh, wait,
sorry. Sacred Flame.

01:25:46.452 --> 01:25:48.148
SAM: You're going to make it live?!

01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:49.205
MATT: That is a 15.

01:25:49.205 --> 01:25:50.112
TALIESIN: Nope, 16.

01:25:50.112 --> 01:25:51.209
MATT: Yep. Roll damage.

01:25:51.209 --> 01:25:52.329
TRAVIS: Natural 20 and a 20.

01:25:52.329 --> 01:25:56.545
MATT: Ooh! So both hits, one with a crit!
That first attack's a crit. Double.

01:25:59.355 --> 01:26:00.793
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage.

01:26:01.743 --> 01:26:06.000
LAURA: It's getting really close, so it's going
to be able to grapple us again very soon.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.436
MATT: Very next round.

01:26:07.436 --> 01:26:17.331
TRAVIS: 13 points of Eldritch Blast on the
first one, and 13 points on the second one.

01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:18.962
Man, that's so weird.

01:26:18.962 --> 01:26:21.905
MATT: Okay. Mighty Nein,
how do you want to do this?

01:26:22.699 --> 01:26:24.205
TALIESIN: With vague interest.

01:26:24.205 --> 01:26:28.512
MATT: With vague interest! It's starting
to loom forward (blasting).

01:26:28.512 --> 01:26:32.010
TRAVIS: No scoot! No! No!

01:26:32.010 --> 01:26:34.590
TALIESIN: Drop it!

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:38.432
MATT: It goes limp. It gets really tense
for a second and then really sad, and is

01:26:38.432 --> 01:26:40.567
like, okay. It's dead.

01:26:40.567 --> 01:26:42.341
LAURA: Yay!

01:26:42.341 --> 01:26:46.781
TALIESIN: Now that that's done, I'm going to
start doing a ten minute heal for whoever.

01:26:46.781 --> 01:26:48.091
Who needs a heal?

01:26:48.091 --> 01:26:49.616
LAURA: I need a heal!

01:26:49.616 --> 01:26:51.875
SAM: You were eaten by it.

01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:55.047
TALIESIN: I'm going to start a ten minute
while you guys dig.

01:26:55.047 --> 01:26:57.527
TRAVIS: Yasha's pulling rocks.
Fjord's pulling rocks.

01:26:57.527 --> 01:26:59.618
LAURA: I think they were a couple, you guys.

01:26:59.618 --> 01:27:02.375
SAM: I think they were a couple.
I think they were married.

01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:06.797
LAURA: I think they've been living down here for
a long time. They were this wonderful couple.

01:27:06.797 --> 01:27:08.607
LIAM: Should we look for their babies?

01:27:08.607 --> 01:27:12.984
LAURA: (gasps) Little rock babies! Maybe that's
why they were mad. Maybe the crystals we took

01:27:12.984 --> 01:27:17.968
were their rock babies. What if it was their
giant baby nest, and we broke their babies out?

01:27:17.968 --> 01:27:19.490
LIAM: How's that tunnel coming?

01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:20.649
TRAVIS: Not fast enough.

01:27:20.649 --> 01:27:26.054
MATT: At this point in time, Beau and Yasha
have managed to pull enough rocks out of

01:27:26.054 --> 01:27:30.618
that tunnel to make it large enough for each
of you-- and Fjord-- to squeeze through.

01:27:30.618 --> 01:27:34.480
You can step through, each of you, and
eventually find yourself on the other side.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.478
The burrowed tunnel continues
ahead of you into darkness.

01:27:38.478 --> 01:27:42.188
TALIESIN: Who needs healing, by the way?
Okay, so just you two?

01:27:42.188 --> 01:27:44.482
LAURA: I think we're the only two that got hurt.

01:27:44.482 --> 01:27:45.756
LIAM: Need it a lot.

01:27:45.756 --> 01:27:47.088
SAM: Beau, did you get hurt?

01:27:47.088 --> 01:27:47.865
MARISHA: No.

01:27:47.865 --> 01:27:50.705
SAM: What are you doing over there?

01:27:50.705 --> 01:27:55.761
TALIESIN: 12 points of healing.

01:27:55.761 --> 01:27:59.642
LIAM: Did I mention I'm a monk?

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:06.498
LAURA: Then I'm going to cast Cure Wounds
on myself as well at 2nd-level.

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:17.604
SAM: Well, we only have about another two
weeks of walking before we get to Xhorhas.

01:28:17.604 --> 01:28:19.053
LAURA: Yeah, no joke.

01:28:19.053 --> 01:28:23.796
SAM: Unless you make us a wagon with paint
and also horses.

01:28:23.796 --> 01:28:25.594
LIAM: And pavement.

01:28:25.594 --> 01:28:34.199
SAM: And pavement. What about bicycles?
You could paint eight bicycles.

01:28:34.199 --> 01:28:36.383
TRAVIS: Nobody knows what that is.

01:28:36.383 --> 01:28:38.979
SAM: It's a weird dream I had.

01:28:39.857 --> 01:28:44.950
MATT: Strange gnomish engineering that's
still in the early development stages.

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:50.706
LAURA: I don't think there's anything that would
really help us down here that I could paint.

01:28:50.706 --> 01:28:57.390
SAM: Do one of you magic-y people have
some way of, next time we see a monster,

01:28:57.390 --> 01:29:01.786
instead of killing it, we could command it
to carry us, or something?

01:29:02.256 --> 01:29:06.025
TALIESIN: We could command it to carry us.
We could ask it politely to carry us.

01:29:06.025 --> 01:29:10.495
LAURA: Yeah, I actually do have the ability to
command things, but they have to be able to

01:29:10.495 --> 01:29:14.791
understand me, and I didn't think that those
rock things probably spoke our language.

01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:17.214
TALIESIN: We never used the magic words,
to be fair.

01:29:17.214 --> 01:29:19.830
LAURA: Well, you know, we could have said
pretty please.

01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:22.066
TALIESIN: Please, thank you.
It gets you so far.

01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:23.880
LAURA: You don't know. I could try it.

01:29:23.883 --> 01:29:24.601
SAM: Next time.

01:29:24.601 --> 01:29:25.413
LAURA: Next time!

01:29:27.273 --> 01:29:29.025
SAM: On we go.

01:29:29.305 --> 01:29:37.533
MATT: Continuing down the familiar,
monotonous carved tunnel. If you're

01:29:37.533 --> 01:29:41.270
keeping the same order, make your perception
checks, keeping a watch out front.

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.431
LIAM: Dancing Lights is up.

01:29:44.431 --> 01:29:48.739
LAURA: Ooh! 24.

01:29:48.739 --> 01:29:55.730
MATT: Nice. You move on for the remainder
of the day before getting to a point where

01:29:55.730 --> 01:30:00.820
you're starting to get a little tired, and you
figure you can continue to push on if you

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:05.920
want to, but you'll begin to push into
possible exhaustion territory. You've now

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.781
hit what would be a full day's worth of
travel, and this burrowed tunnel continues

01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:13.397
on. You've found one chamber and then
passed it, so at least you know there's

01:30:13.397 --> 01:30:17.634
probably more to come in the level you are
currently traveling in, but this day's

01:30:17.634 --> 01:30:21.081
travel, after that last encounter,
you have not found another chamber.

01:30:21.163 --> 01:30:25.424
MARISHA: I haven't seen any form of
writing, no offshoots, nothing like that?

01:30:25.424 --> 01:30:31.729
MATT: Nope. But the good news is as long as
you have this tunnel, you know

01:30:31.729 --> 01:30:33.381
at least you're probably on the right track.

01:30:34.053 --> 01:30:37.941
TALIESIN: If you want, I can Stone Shape.
I can push us in a--

01:30:37.941 --> 01:30:39.239
LIAM: We can do the same.

01:30:39.239 --> 01:30:44.962
TALIESIN: I'm going to carve a hole about
the size of what we need so we can be

01:30:44.962 --> 01:30:46.489
pressed into the wall.

01:30:46.489 --> 01:30:48.627
MATT: Okay. And the width of that is?

01:30:48.627 --> 01:30:52.150
LIAM: Oh, it's-- hold on a second.

01:30:52.196 --> 01:30:55.602
TALIESIN: It might be too big for me to carve.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:31:00.144
MATT: I think it might be a bit large to
carve the whole thing.

01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:03.040
LIAM: I can't remember. Almost there.
Ten-foot radius, yeah.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.700
MATT: Ten-foot radius, yeah. So you can carve part
of it, and it'll still be partially exposed, but

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:11.627
he can color it as he wants, and with the
stone, it'll help somewhat camouflage it.

01:31:11.627 --> 01:31:14.160
LAURA: Yeah, nothing can get through it anyway.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.733
LIAM: We'll repeat everything, and I will
send Frumpkin up ahead of us 50 feet

01:31:19.733 --> 01:31:24.095
to stay up all night, as a guard to come
running back in if need be.

01:31:24.095 --> 01:31:26.752
MATT: So you guys spend the evening.
Another long rest.

01:31:26.752 --> 01:31:29.754
Roll perception for Frumpkin for the evening,
if you don't mind.

01:31:29.754 --> 01:31:31.322
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.

01:31:31.322 --> 01:31:32.052
MATT: Okay.

01:31:32.066 --> 01:31:39.908
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending for Yeza.
I'm going to say: It's me again. Can you

01:31:39.908 --> 01:31:48.712
let us know if you've been on the move,
or if you're staying in the same place?

01:31:48.712 --> 01:31:50.584
SAM: Out of the tunnels?

01:31:52.684 --> 01:31:55.256
LAURA: Are you in the tunnels still?

01:31:55.554 --> 01:31:57.995
TRAVIS: Are you in the tunnels?

01:31:58.413 --> 01:32:11.043
MATT: There's a brief pause and then, "Ah.
No, they just have me in a room. We haven't

01:32:11.043 --> 01:32:19.294
been traveling underground since we got out,
but they have me in the city now."

01:32:19.294 --> 01:32:20.427
LAURA: (whispers) Shit.

01:32:20.428 --> 01:32:23.919
SAM: Why'd you say "shit"? What's going on?

01:32:25.429 --> 01:32:30.808
LAURA: He's already in the city. We're not
going to be able to ambush them, you guys.

01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:38.440
SAM: Okay, well, we'll come up with
another plan. You guys are smart.

01:32:38.715 --> 01:32:41.921
TRAVIS: Yeah, and there wasn't much of an
ambush we could do anyway.

01:32:41.921 --> 01:32:44.626
It's one way in, one way out. We'll be fine.

01:32:44.762 --> 01:32:47.233
MARISHA: It's more information, which is
always good.

01:32:50.084 --> 01:32:51.013
LAURA: Yeah.

01:32:53.386 --> 01:32:57.125
SAM: Let's go to sleep so we can start early
in the morning.

01:32:57.125 --> 01:32:58.570
MATT: Perception for Frumpkin?

01:32:58.570 --> 01:32:59.649
LIAM: 17 for Frumpkin.

01:32:59.655 --> 01:33:07.179
MATT: Good to know. The evening goes by. Frumpkin
does notice throughout the evening some movement

01:33:07.179 --> 01:33:16.694
through the tunnel: a strange creature, similar to
what seemed to be the stalagmite-type roper

01:33:16.694 --> 01:33:22.788
creatures who you had fought before, but a little
smaller, scooting along the ceiling. It made it

01:33:22.788 --> 01:33:29.949
through the tunnel, over top of you guys, and then
continued on without noticing or caring about the

01:33:29.949 --> 01:33:39.948
location where you had placed and camouflaged your
evening's rest. The next morning comes to.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:46.435
You continue traveling? All right. Keeping a
watch out, Laura, please, as Jester, roll your

01:33:46.435 --> 01:33:52.834
perception check. It's a long subterranean journey
for me doing day-to-day here. I'm sorry.

01:33:54.204 --> 01:33:55.480
TALIESIN: Oof.

01:33:55.771 --> 01:33:56.826
SAM: Barf.

01:33:57.626 --> 01:33:59.483
LAURA: That's a bad one. Eight.

01:33:59.573 --> 01:34:03.141
MATT: Okay. You got a keen eye out there
in front of you.

01:34:04.381 --> 01:34:07.818
LAURA: Sorry, guys. I rolled really well
yesterday, though.

01:34:07.818 --> 01:34:14.810
MATT: This day is the hardest so far, because
it is an entire eight-plus hours of just

01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:22.762
winding tunnel. Once again, that continuous
pace. It seems to dip at times and then

01:34:22.762 --> 01:34:32.239
it picks up. It has its own organic shifting
to it in small bits, but it is a day of travel

01:34:32.239 --> 01:34:37.281
of that same ten-foot wide, continuous
tunnel, and it is maddening.

01:34:37.281 --> 01:34:42.476
LAURA: (singing) 66 bottles of beer on the wall,
66 bottles of beer.

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:49.491
ALL: (singing) Take one down, pass it around,
65 bottles of beer on the wall.

01:34:49.491 --> 01:34:54.275
LAURA: (strained singing) 21 bottles of beer
on the wall--

01:34:54.275 --> 01:34:58.994
LIAM: Also, all throughout the day, once
an hour, Caleb says: It's 2:00.

01:34:58.994 --> 01:35:00.016
SAM: Shut up.

01:35:00.646 --> 01:35:02.139
LIAM: An hour goes by--

01:35:02.139 --> 01:35:03.378
MATT: Perfect.

01:35:04.388 --> 01:35:05.356
LIAM: It's 3:00.

01:35:05.356 --> 01:35:06.058
SAM: No.

01:35:06.058 --> 01:35:09.816
TRAVIS: You know, if you're going to do those,
maybe put some chimes behind them

01:35:09.816 --> 01:35:11.498
so you can be like a bell tower.

01:35:11.498 --> 01:35:15.473
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy every time he says it
to make the bing-bong noise.

01:35:15.473 --> 01:35:20.367
LIAM: An hour later: Ding-dong ding-dong.
It's 4:00.

01:35:22.517 --> 01:35:29.885
MATT: All right. That day's travel goes by
uneventful. So day three is done,

01:35:29.885 --> 01:35:32.369
do you guys set up camp once more
here in the tunnel?

01:35:32.369 --> 01:35:35.975
LAURA: Same deal? I'm going to send
a message to Yeza.

01:35:36.365 --> 01:35:37.359
MATT: Okay.

01:35:39.399 --> 01:35:40.691
LAURA: S'me again.

01:35:41.071 --> 01:35:44.692
TRAVIS: Is "s'me" one word? "s" apostrophe
m-e? Okay.

01:35:45.207 --> 01:35:46.560
MATT: I think so.

01:35:47.084 --> 01:35:52.608
LAURA: How long were you in these tunnels?
Do you know? How do you feel?

01:35:53.818 --> 01:36:02.409
We're on the way. Your wife misses you
a lot. She loves you.

01:36:02.728 --> 01:36:03.900
TRAVIS: She loves.

01:36:04.654 --> 01:36:09.367
LAURA: Shit. I thought that meant I used
two, I had three left. Shit. She loves.

01:36:10.877 --> 01:36:12.163
MATT: She loves a lot.

01:36:12.288 --> 01:36:13.939
TRAVIS: I'm roughly counting, so I don't know.

01:36:15.926 --> 01:36:17.777
MATT: All you hear is, "I can't."

01:36:18.822 --> 01:36:19.788
LAURA: Oh no!

01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:23.579
SAM: What is that? What's the "oh no"?
What is that? That's even worse than

01:36:23.579 --> 01:36:24.897
"oh shit." What is that?

01:36:26.049 --> 01:36:30.385
LAURA: I just think somebody was-- he wasn't alone
this time and he couldn't respond is all.

01:36:30.385 --> 01:36:31.484
SAM: Is he okay?

01:36:31.484 --> 01:36:34.912
LAURA: Yeah! He just said "I can't" so
I was like "Oh! Okay." That's all.

01:36:34.912 --> 01:36:37.195
SAM: Like I can't breathe? I can't live anymore?

01:36:37.195 --> 01:36:41.758
LAURA: No like, I can't talk to you he basically
said, "I can't talk to you right now, I'm busy."

01:36:41.758 --> 01:36:45.844
TALIESIN: I can't eat this, I can't floss,
there's all sorts of things people can't do.

01:36:45.844 --> 01:36:48.030
LAURA: I think he was in the middle of dinner.

01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:51.124
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I can't do all sorts
of things when I'm eating.

01:36:51.134 --> 01:36:56.187
LAURA: Yeah. It'll be okay, Nott.
It'll be okay.

01:36:56.187 --> 01:36:59.039
SAM: Yes, I know. We'll find him.

01:36:59.204 --> 01:37:06.223
TRAVIS: Nott, I have to say I've been feeling
pretty bad hearing that you drowned previously.

01:37:06.223 --> 01:37:13.965
I want to apologize for making you face your fear
over and over again. No, I've been giving you some

01:37:13.965 --> 01:37:21.305
shit, and as someone who has experienced the
same thing, I commend you for your bravery.

01:37:21.305 --> 01:37:24.133
SAM: You've experienced the same thing;
you've drowned?

01:37:24.133 --> 01:37:25.195
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:37:25.195 --> 01:37:27.282
SAM: Oh, that's right.

01:37:28.812 --> 01:37:31.481
TRAVIS: That's cool, don't worry about it. Yeah.

01:37:31.481 --> 01:37:33.787
SAM: Well, you didn't know.
How would you have known?

01:37:36.207 --> 01:37:39.543
TRAVIS: No, but thank you all the same.

01:37:41.383 --> 01:37:46.423
LIAM: You took a lot of courage to go in. I was
not very helpful in that regard either. You did

01:37:46.423 --> 01:37:53.777
not tell us what was going on. Why would you?
You still went in for a long time. So, sorry.

01:37:54.547 --> 01:38:05.646
SAM: No, it's all right. I'm sorry that I wasn't
more helpful in that earlier fight when I panicked

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:15.645
and didn't go in the water. But it's not so bad if
you're down in the water with your friends.

01:38:18.205 --> 01:38:20.933
LIAM: Oh! It's nine o'clock.

01:38:21.223 --> 01:38:22.685
SAM: Fuck you!

01:38:22.685 --> 01:38:29.155
(laughter)

01:38:29.155 --> 01:38:31.212
SAM: Your people did this to me!

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:40.032
(laughter)

01:38:42.212 --> 01:38:45.623
MATT: So you settle in for your third evening
here underground.

01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:47.691
LAURA: I'm going to use a spell!

01:38:47.691 --> 01:38:50.491
SAM: I assume they've been making food for us
and stuff?

01:38:50.971 --> 01:38:52.082
LAURA: Yeah!

01:38:52.082 --> 01:38:55.261
MATT: I would hope so, because your provisions
are going to run out pretty quickly otherwise.

01:38:55.881 --> 01:38:57.995
LAURA: Sure, we've been making food.

01:38:57.995 --> 01:39:00.522
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had that spell set up. Sure.

01:39:01.792 --> 01:39:07.033
MATT: Divine mac and cheese. Doesn't taste divine,
just is divine.

01:39:07.223 --> 01:39:11.439
LAURA: I can't do the spell I was going to do
because I forgot I didn't have it prepared,

01:39:11.439 --> 01:39:12.975
but maybe tomorrow!

01:39:12.975 --> 01:39:18.376
MATT: Maybe tomorrow. So same set up?
Evening's rest, Frumpkin's keeping watch.

01:39:18.376 --> 01:39:20.664
Go ahead and roll perception check
for Frumpkin.

01:39:23.834 --> 01:39:24.840
LIAM: Ah, six.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.320
MATT: Six, okay good to know.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.121
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking balls.

01:39:28.551 --> 01:39:34.998
MATT: As the evening goes on...
Frumpkin doesn't notice anything.

01:39:36.298 --> 01:39:37.446
LIAM: Good cat.

01:39:37.906 --> 01:39:46.245
MATT: You wake up. Your fourth day begins.
You gather your things and begin to trek

01:39:46.245 --> 01:39:50.062
even further into this single,
perpetual, tunnel.

01:39:50.062 --> 01:40:00.017
MARISHA: Hey guys. I'm just saying, if we're going
to be underground in a blank, boring, shit-hole

01:40:00.017 --> 01:40:06.536
tunnel for a whole 'nother day, I still have some
of these mushrooms left over from Mollymauk.

01:40:07.556 --> 01:40:09.326
SAM: It would pass the time.

01:40:09.326 --> 01:40:11.532
MARISHA: Might just help make it fun.

01:40:11.532 --> 01:40:13.855
TRAVIS: Wow, really? Now?

01:40:13.855 --> 01:40:15.073
MARISHA: I'm real bored.

01:40:15.073 --> 01:40:19.786
TRAVIS: It's super dark. Lives could be at
jeopardy at any moment, and you want to trip?

01:40:19.786 --> 01:40:25.930
LAURA: Yeah, it's true. If those cone-head
thingys come out again, I don't want

01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:29.064
any of you not being aware of what's happening.

01:40:30.084 --> 01:40:31.396
MARISHA: I'm just so bored.

01:40:31.396 --> 01:40:32.487
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:40:32.487 --> 01:40:33.781
LIAM: You're bored?

01:40:33.781 --> 01:40:34.519
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:40:34.519 --> 01:40:41.302
LIAM: Really? Look at this. Frumpkin gets
up onto his hind legs and does a little--

01:40:41.302 --> 01:40:43.801
(laughter)

01:40:43.801 --> 01:40:48.705
LAURA: Oh, Beau! You know what we could do?
Here, take this. I'm going to give her the

01:40:48.705 --> 01:40:51.523
smutty book that you gave me just recently.

01:40:51.523 --> 01:40:53.227
MARISHA: (gasps)

01:40:53.227 --> 01:40:55.716
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait! Read it out loud!

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:57.293
MARISHA: Okay!

01:40:57.293 --> 01:40:59.999
TRAVIS: Why do you do these things?

01:40:59.999 --> 01:41:02.916
LAURA: Now we can all have entertainment
while we're walking!

01:41:02.916 --> 01:41:06.013
SAM: It's like listening to a podcast
when you're driving to work.

01:41:06.013 --> 01:41:10.383
MARISHA: It already starts good, you guys.
It was a glistening night--

01:41:10.383 --> 01:41:12.198
TRAVIS: Oh, crap. No.

01:41:12.198 --> 01:41:15.817
MARISHA: The snow fell on the winding paths.

01:41:15.817 --> 01:41:17.886
SAM: Oh, just like the path we're on!

01:41:17.886 --> 01:41:22.298
MARISHA: It was chilly. She could feel her
nipples getting hard.

01:41:22.298 --> 01:41:25.133
It starts so soon, it starts so soon!

01:41:25.133 --> 01:41:28.789
LAURA: I mean, normally it doesn't take, but--

01:41:28.789 --> 01:41:30.908
TALIESIN: That was going right into it.

01:41:30.908 --> 01:41:32.540
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw!

01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:35.729
MATT: This is just an overall penalty to stealth.

01:41:35.729 --> 01:41:39.393
(laughter)

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:43.087
TRAVIS: Is there anything on the ceiling as I
awkwardly stare up at it?

01:41:43.087 --> 01:41:46.399
MATT: Both you and Jester both make
perception checks.

01:41:46.399 --> 01:41:48.253
TRAVIS: Oh, I was kidding, but--

01:41:48.253 --> 01:41:54.755
MARISHA: She felt the warmth of a fire. She could
feel his warm touch as it was grasping around--

01:41:54.755 --> 01:41:58.264
SAM: Around what? Around her waist? Around
her buttocks? What?

01:41:58.264 --> 01:41:59.377
TRAVIS: 17.

01:41:59.377 --> 01:42:05.289
MARISHA: As his strong, burly, hairy arms
wrapped around her waist, she could feel

01:42:05.289 --> 01:42:09.379
her breath leaving her bodice.
This is so good, Jester!

01:42:09.379 --> 01:42:10.942
LAURA: I know! Thank you, Caleb.

01:42:10.942 --> 01:42:11.801
MATT: Travis.

01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:12.575
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:42:12.575 --> 01:42:19.090
MATT: Fjord, at this point, trying to ignore that
and facing forward, is continuing. The path, this

01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:26.758
protracted tunnel, you begin to notice smaller
tunnels intersecting with it.

01:42:26.758 --> 01:42:28.515
TRAVIS: Like on the sides, or--?

01:42:28.515 --> 01:42:31.620
MATT: Like one on the side, one a little higher.

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:33.355
TRAVIS: Up in front of us?

01:42:33.355 --> 01:42:37.485
SAM: While I'm listening to Beau, I'm
going to fold my arms so no one can

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:39.848
see the shape of my nipples right now.

01:42:39.848 --> 01:42:43.173
(laughter)

01:42:43.173 --> 01:42:44.134
MATT: All right.

01:42:44.134 --> 01:42:47.818
LIAM: You know, you are a very good reader.
You give it a lot of character.

01:42:48.008 --> 01:42:52.174
MARISHA: (stuttering) Thanks.
As she reached down--

01:42:52.174 --> 01:42:58.955
TRAVIS: Man, I hate to interrupt, but you know,
we have some divergent pathways ahead.

01:42:58.955 --> 01:43:01.190
TALIESIN: How big are they?

01:43:01.190 --> 01:43:06.860
MATT: You look up and you can see. They are maybe
about two, three feet wide each. From what you can

01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:14.930
see, the entrance to the first one on the right
that's on the right side, a lot of dirt and rock

01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:21.309
has been pushed into it. It's kind of closed off.
You walk up to the second one. It's a little more

01:43:21.309 --> 01:43:27.891
up on the left, higher range of it, and you can
see there are bits of stone and dirt that have

01:43:27.891 --> 01:43:31.317
fallen out and created a small pile
on the ground beneath it.

01:43:32.127 --> 01:43:33.684
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:43:33.684 --> 01:43:37.105
LIAM: Do they bear any resemblance
to the giant hole that we were following?

01:43:37.105 --> 01:43:38.684
MATT: No.

01:43:38.684 --> 01:43:43.036
TRAVIS: Hey, you want to send that cat
of yours about 50 feet behind us?

01:43:43.036 --> 01:43:44.296
LIAM: Oh, behind us?

01:43:44.296 --> 01:43:47.112
LAURA: Do we hear anything coming from
the tunnels?

01:43:47.112 --> 01:43:51.168
MATT: You, who have been so distracted by the
reading of the book, hear nothing.

01:43:51.168 --> 01:43:53.810
TRAVIS: It looks like two of those had
stuff pushed into it.

01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:55.702
That one looks like something came out of it.

01:43:55.702 --> 01:44:00.671
TALIESIN: Wouldn't maybe if you were traveling
these caves, you would've capped them because of

01:44:00.671 --> 01:44:03.310
things that kept popping out of the wall?

01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:09.077
MATT: Caleb, looking at this, you figure these
tunnels existed before this burrowing happened,

01:44:09.077 --> 01:44:13.717
and it looks like when this worm came through,
it tore through whatever these tunnels were

01:44:13.717 --> 01:44:19.624
and pushed shit into them and wrecked
a little bit of this tunnel structure.

01:44:19.624 --> 01:44:22.446
TRAVIS: That one came into this one, though.
After the big guy came through.

01:44:22.946 --> 01:44:23.934
TALIESIN: What?

01:44:24.114 --> 01:44:29.127
MARISHA: That's funny, that was exactly
what was about to happen. I'm sorry, what?

01:44:29.887 --> 01:44:33.952
I'm going to-- I bookmarked it.

01:44:36.912 --> 01:44:39.651
TRAVIS: Caduceus, go look up front!
Jesus, god.

01:44:40.351 --> 01:44:41.842
SAM: He can't see in the dark.

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:45.950
TALIESIN: I've got a light. Does it look like
these were-- I'm going to go up to one

01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:49.809
and examine it. Do I hear anything? Do I see
any scrapings that would give a sign?

01:44:49.809 --> 01:44:51.451
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:44:53.531 --> 01:44:56.543
TALIESIN: It's 15.

01:44:56.543 --> 01:45:06.257
MATT: Listening in, looking up there,
you don't see anything-- the one to the right,

01:45:06.257 --> 01:45:08.914
you don't see anything,
you don't hear anything.

01:45:08.914 --> 01:45:11.292
TALIESIN: These markings on the interior--

01:45:11.292 --> 01:45:18.469
MATT: You do notice some markings,
quick little cuts in the dirt or stone,

01:45:18.469 --> 01:45:22.615
like hand or claw marks dragged
across bits of it. Small.

01:45:22.615 --> 01:45:24.224
TALIESIN: Something burrowed.

01:45:24.224 --> 01:45:28.945
MATT: You see the pile of rocks and dirt that have
fallen along the top. You glance over and you can

01:45:28.945 --> 01:45:33.599
see something somewhat shiny that's
picking up the light from your globe.

01:45:33.599 --> 01:45:37.471
TALIESIN: I'm going to clean it off a bit.

01:45:37.471 --> 01:45:49.254
MATT: It looks like a hammer, but it's not well
taken care of, per se. Your nose picks up a little

01:45:49.254 --> 01:45:55.048
bit of the air here; it smells somewhat rancid,
a little bit. Just a faint hint of rot.

01:45:55.048 --> 01:46:00.698
TRAVIS: Anything behind us?

01:46:00.698 --> 01:46:03.660
TALIESIN: I'm worried about the things around us.

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:06.674
LIAM: How high off of the ground is that hole?

01:46:06.674 --> 01:46:12.999
MATT: It's about ten feet up. The whole
tunnel is one big ten-foot side to side.

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:16.331
TALIESIN: I'm going to clear away a little bit
more. Is there a body underneath this pile?

01:46:16.331 --> 01:46:17.240
MATT: No body.

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:18.383
TALIESIN: Just a hammer?

01:46:18.383 --> 01:46:20.280
MATT: Yeah, just like a discarded tool.

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.464
TALIESIN: I'll take a look at the hammer.

01:46:22.464 --> 01:46:27.723
MATT: It's a hammer. It looks like it's
seen a lot of use.

01:46:27.723 --> 01:46:29.151
TRAVIS: Why? Why a hammer?

01:46:29.151 --> 01:46:35.350
MATT: The metal's wrecked a little bit in places
and it's been bludgeoned and misused.

01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:37.385
TALIESIN: I think someone got grabbed.

01:46:37.385 --> 01:46:43.604
SAM: Are the rocks around here dug out,
like someone was digging?

01:46:43.604 --> 01:46:46.789
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:46:46.789 --> 01:46:50.364
SAM: 28.

01:46:50.364 --> 01:46:56.573
MATT: They have been dug, and you see
signs that they were dug out by hand

01:46:56.573 --> 01:47:00.625
and dug out by shovel, or some sort
of a tool used for digging.

01:47:00.625 --> 01:47:02.430
SAM: From above, or from--?

01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:07.292
MATT: From above and the side. You get the sense
that the one that opens up here connected to the

01:47:07.292 --> 01:47:12.585
other one, and this tunnel was burrowed in the
middle and took out that connecting point.

01:47:12.585 --> 01:47:14.163
TALIESIN: I've got a crazy idea.

01:47:14.163 --> 01:47:18.123
TRAVIS: What, that we can be under the Ashkeeper
Peaks and these are mining tunnels?

01:47:18.123 --> 01:47:21.726
TALIESIN: Well, no-- that's great.
That's way better.

01:47:23.156 --> 01:47:24.963
SAM: He just wanted to play Parcheesi.

01:47:26.573 --> 01:47:28.495
LAURA: What were you thinking, Caduceus?

01:47:28.495 --> 01:47:34.407
TALIESIN: I think that this was some sort
of pathway and maybe this closed-off

01:47:34.407 --> 01:47:41.663
pathway here is possibly the way to go,
I don't know. I feel like we might have

01:47:41.663 --> 01:47:44.867
found a way of sneaking into
where we're going.

01:47:46.137 --> 01:47:47.147
SAM: Sneaking in?

01:47:47.147 --> 01:47:53.803
MARISHA: Is there any remnants of precious
metals, coals, things that would be mined?

01:47:54.933 --> 01:47:59.204
MATT: Looking around here, most of it
appears to be carved stone and dirt.

01:47:59.204 --> 01:48:03.604
TALIESIN: If anyone doesn't mind, I'm going to
pull out my shovel and start working on this.

01:48:03.604 --> 01:48:07.466
TRAVIS: I think we're dead under this
mountain-peak, right? (counting)

01:48:07.466 --> 01:48:08.319
We're like (taps).

01:48:08.319 --> 01:48:09.841
MARISHA: We've got to be, right?

01:48:09.841 --> 01:48:12.465
TALIESIN: This blocked off path that this
got bisected--

01:48:12.465 --> 01:48:15.180
SAM: So we could go up to get out
if we wanted to get out.

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:19.430
TALIESIN: Or we could go down this way, because I
don't think there's that much dirt in this--

01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:22.190
MATT: Well, the tunnel continues also.
It's up to you guys.

01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:24.696
LIAM: We can bail if we wanted to, perhaps.

01:48:24.696 --> 01:48:29.897
MARISHA: Would I know the exact boundary
line of Xhorhas between the Empire?

01:48:29.897 --> 01:48:32.114
Do they use the mountains?

01:48:32.114 --> 01:48:36.712
MATT: The Ashkeeper Peaks are what divides the two
sides of eastern and western Wynandir, yeah.

01:48:36.712 --> 01:48:41.373
TRAVIS: Might as well see where this thing goes.
We can keep going if we have to.

01:48:41.373 --> 01:48:45.804
SAM: We can go see the sun for a couple of hours,
get some vitamin D, and then come back down.

01:48:45.804 --> 01:48:50.233
MARISHA: If we're under the mountains, it could be
a long way up, and we don't know what those

01:48:50.233 --> 01:48:56.528
mountains look like. I mean, I don't know, it also
could be fall and temperate and beautiful.

01:48:56.528 --> 01:48:59.212
TRAVIS: There could be pigeons on the
mountaintop.

01:48:59.212 --> 01:49:01.309
SAM: Edible pigeons?

01:49:01.309 --> 01:49:03.459
TRAVIS: Is there another kind?

01:49:03.459 --> 01:49:05.047
SAM: No.

01:49:05.047 --> 01:49:09.875
LAURA: I read scary books when I was little about
these creatures that lived in the mountains that

01:49:09.875 --> 01:49:14.442
were see-through because they lived underground
for so long, but they had really long claws and

01:49:14.442 --> 01:49:17.371
they would snatch up babies.

01:49:17.371 --> 01:49:19.281
TRAVIS: Not helping.

01:49:19.281 --> 01:49:21.619
LAURA: I'm just saying maybe we should
avoid them.

01:49:21.619 --> 01:49:25.708
TALIESIN: I'm going to start prodding to see
how deep this cap on this bottom one goes.

01:49:25.708 --> 01:49:30.226
MATT: It's a couple of feet deep, and the rest of
the tunnel goes beyond, but for you, Caduceus,

01:49:30.226 --> 01:49:33.981
it's a tight squeeze. We're talking Bishop in
Aliens getting through the tunnel.

01:49:33.981 --> 01:49:37.540
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look in there.
Do I feel any wind, anything--?

01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:38.292
MATT: No.

01:49:38.292 --> 01:49:39.906
TALIESIN: It's just stagnant air?

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:42.181
MATT: Yeah. There's no breeze in here, no.

01:49:42.721 --> 01:49:48.962
SAM: If we go topside, what are the
possible benefits of doing that?

01:49:48.962 --> 01:49:53.942
LIAM: Well, not going to Xhorhas and
getting murdered by far greater forces--

01:49:53.942 --> 01:49:55.350
SAM: We're going to Xhorhas.

01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:57.447
LIAM: -- but I think we're going to Xhorhas.

01:49:57.447 --> 01:50:01.979
SAM: We could go up and maybe find a horse or
something and coax it down here to take us faster.

01:50:01.979 --> 01:50:04.124
TALIESIN: A horse on the top of the mountain?

01:50:04.124 --> 01:50:08.782
SAM: I don't know, if this miner fellow who was
eaten alive left a couple of horses tied up there--

01:50:08.782 --> 01:50:11.441
TALIESIN: Why would he leave horses
on top of a mountain?

01:50:11.451 --> 01:50:15.450
SAM: Why would you bring them into the mountain?
You would leave them tied up on top.

01:50:15.450 --> 01:50:19.295
LAURA: What if it's not a miner from the top?
What if it's one of the creatures that

01:50:19.295 --> 01:50:22.449
I was talking about and this is his hammer
and the tunnel actually--

01:50:22.449 --> 01:50:23.540
SAM: The worm's hammer?

01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:27.446
LAURA: No, what if it's a creature that
lives in the mountain and he's got a hammer

01:50:27.446 --> 01:50:31.628
and one of these tunnels leads to his village
under the mountain and it's a whole village

01:50:31.628 --> 01:50:34.298
of scary people that's going to
attack us as soon as we--

01:50:34.298 --> 01:50:38.140
SAM: Caduceus, cast Talk to Objects.
Ask the hammer.

01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:41.040
TALIESIN: What would you like me
to ask the hammer?

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.116
SAM: Who was your owner?

01:50:43.116 --> 01:50:44.703
LIAM: There is really only one reason
to use the side tunnels.

01:50:44.703 --> 01:50:46.079
TALIESIN: Who was your owner?

01:50:46.079 --> 01:50:47.210
LIAM: To leave.

01:50:47.210 --> 01:50:50.840
LAURA: (whispering) To go poop, because
there's not really a lot of privacy--

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.311
LIAM: You can do that anywhere.

01:50:52.311 --> 01:50:56.453
TALIESIN: The hammer is very obstinate, but
I would imagine that's expected of a hammer.

01:50:56.453 --> 01:51:00.026
I'm not going to say it wasn't worth a try.
I would have been surprised, but

01:51:00.026 --> 01:51:01.741
I would have been delighted as well.

01:51:01.741 --> 01:51:05.590
TRAVIS: Do we have any real positives for
going up? I honestly can't think of any.

01:51:05.590 --> 01:51:09.213
LIAM: Only if we wanted to give up, which
we are not doing, so we go forward.

01:51:09.213 --> 01:51:14.626
MARISHA: (laughs) Okay, here's the other thing,
though-- sorry, I'm dying at the hammer.

01:51:14.626 --> 01:51:22.219
This is, arguably, going to lead to a nexus,
right? Like an entry point?

01:51:22.599 --> 01:51:23.618
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:51:24.338 --> 01:51:30.804
MARISHA: So what's on the other si-- Did they
build a military base around the entrance

01:51:30.804 --> 01:51:33.947
to this tunnel system and is that
what we're about to walk into?

01:51:33.947 --> 01:51:35.041
SAM: If we go up?

01:51:35.041 --> 01:51:40.876
MARISHA: If we go forward. If we keep
following this, is it going to lead us--

01:51:40.876 --> 01:51:43.466
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: There's no way to know.

01:51:43.466 --> 01:51:46.751
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I know. I was just
kind of throwing it out there.

01:51:46.751 --> 01:51:48.509
TRAVIS: How far can Frumpkin go?

01:51:48.509 --> 01:51:52.848
TALIESIN: Actually, that's a good idea. Can we
send Frumpkin down one of these tiny tunnels?

01:51:52.848 --> 01:51:58.619
LIAM: Quite a ways, but if he gets too far away, I
no longer have the ability to communicate with him.

01:51:58.619 --> 01:52:00.624
TRAVIS: How about just to that edge, then?

01:52:02.964 --> 01:52:04.081
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay.

01:52:04.081 --> 01:52:05.214
TALIESIN: Cool.

01:52:05.214 --> 01:52:06.788
MATT: So you send Frumpkin ahead?

01:52:06.788 --> 01:52:07.720
LIAM: Sure.

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:12.920
MATT: Roll a perception check for Frumpkin. In the
dark, so disadvantage on the perception check.

01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:16.365
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but advantage with smell
if there's anything stinky.

01:52:16.365 --> 01:52:17.862
MATT: Okay, good to know.

01:52:17.862 --> 01:52:21.467
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea.

01:52:21.467 --> 01:52:23.099
MATT: What's your idea?

01:52:23.099 --> 01:52:29.151
LAURA: What if I cast Daylight? We could tie a
ribbon around Frumpkin's neck, I cast Daylight

01:52:29.151 --> 01:52:32.989
on his neck, on the ribbon, and then
he can see wherever he goes.

01:52:32.989 --> 01:52:36.798
TALIESIN: I can cast Light on the ribbon,
too, so you don't have to burn a spell.

01:52:36.798 --> 01:52:38.527
LAURA: Hey, that's better than that.

01:52:38.527 --> 01:52:42.589
TALIESIN: I cast Light on something
tied to Frumpkin.

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:46.021
LAURA: I take a ribbon off my horn
and wrap it around Frumpkin's neck.

01:52:46.021 --> 01:52:47.651
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

01:52:47.771 --> 01:52:52.400
LIAM: Put the ribbon on the backside
so it's not right in his eyes.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:57.825
MATT: You tie a little ribbon around Frumpkin's
neck, you cast Light, and now the ribbon gives off

01:52:57.825 --> 01:53:00.634
this torchlight glow from the back of Frumpkin.

01:53:00.634 --> 01:53:03.239
LIAM: For the first ten seconds, Frumpkin goes--

01:53:03.239 --> 01:53:07.089
(laughter)

01:53:07.089 --> 01:53:08.312
TRAVIS: Get it off!

01:53:08.832 --> 01:53:12.582
LIAM: But gets used to it, and then trots off.

01:53:12.582 --> 01:53:15.639
MATT: Now roll a straight perception roll
for Frumpkin.

01:53:15.639 --> 01:53:18.609
LIAM: I did, I rolled twice, so it's a 16
perception.

01:53:18.609 --> 01:53:30.120
MATT: 16, okay. Frumpkin continues on 50 feet, 80
feet. About another hundred feet or so, there's

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:39.726
another tunnel intersection; it's breached by this
carving path. Then, about another 130 feet or so,

01:53:39.726 --> 01:53:48.358
another chamber opens up. This chamber is about 40
foot by 80 foot and the smell here is strong,

01:53:48.358 --> 01:53:58.990
Frumpkin picks up on. It smells of rot, mildew,
feces. It's not a pleasant smell, and there are

01:53:58.990 --> 01:54:13.863
piles of refuse and furs and utensils and belts
and odd objects that are thrown into piles here.

01:54:13.863 --> 01:54:18.850
You can see a number of other tunnels that all
intersect into this area.

01:54:18.850 --> 01:54:22.981
LIAM: Is there any immediate reaction to a glowing
cat entering into this big chamber?

01:54:22.981 --> 01:54:23.867
MATT: Nope.

01:54:24.247 --> 01:54:28.076
TALIESIN: Maybe roll back and try
one of these smaller tunnels also,

01:54:28.076 --> 01:54:32.560
just to see what's a few feet down, maybe?

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:35.033
LIAM: I can't hear anybody.

01:54:35.033 --> 01:54:37.788
TALIESIN: I mean, it seems like the thing to do.

01:54:37.788 --> 01:54:38.979
TRAVIS: He can't hear us.

01:54:38.979 --> 01:54:40.030
TALIESIN: What?

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:41.636
LAURA: Oh, Caduceus.

01:54:41.636 --> 01:54:42.385
TALIESIN: Yeah?

01:54:42.385 --> 01:54:44.859
LAURA: He can't hear us when he's
doing these things.

01:54:44.859 --> 01:54:45.701
TALIESIN: Really?

01:54:45.701 --> 01:54:48.177
LIAM: How many chambers are--
Is it just many, many--

01:54:48.177 --> 01:54:53.464
MATT: Ten or so different tunnels lead
into this chamber, all ranging between

01:54:53.464 --> 01:54:55.539
two feet wide to about three feet wide.

01:54:55.539 --> 01:55:00.070
LIAM: I'm just watching. I can no longer send
commands, I can only go along for the ride

01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:04.191
to watch. Am I seeing anything like
mining equipment?

01:55:04.361 --> 01:55:15.986
MATT: You see a small broken shovel. There are
piles of dirt, bones, coins. Looks like a lot of

01:55:15.986 --> 01:55:22.435
things that have been gathered. You can see
warped pieces of wood that are partially

01:55:22.435 --> 01:55:31.520
whittled and then abandoned in the moment.
Stacks of a bunch of junk.

01:55:36.650 --> 01:55:37.411
LIAM: Okay.

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:44.531
MATT: Frumpkin hears a small growl and looks,
and in the far-right corner, there's a small cage.

01:55:44.531 --> 01:55:50.410
In the cage, there's some sort of a furred
creature, no more than that big or so,

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:56.209
that's missing tufts of fur, and it's
in the cage going (growling).

01:55:57.929 --> 01:56:00.283
LIAM: Okay, I leave him there and come out of it.

01:56:00.283 --> 01:56:01.825
LAURA: What'd you see?

01:56:01.825 --> 01:56:05.558
LIAM: Well, it's a good walk a ways,
and then there is a larger chamber with

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:13.372
many different exits to it, and my good boy
saw some sort of creature in a cage.

01:56:13.372 --> 01:56:15.280
LAURA: How big of a creature?

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.460
LIAM: Wuh.

01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:20.432
LAURA: Did it seem cute?

01:56:20.432 --> 01:56:21.785
LIAM: Hard to tell.

01:56:22.405 --> 01:56:25.712
SAM: You said there's a lot of entrances
and exits to this place?

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:26.644
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:26.644 --> 01:56:31.015
MATT: They're platforms, the topography of the
inside-- it's not just a perfectly oval thing.

01:56:31.015 --> 01:56:35.063
It has a bunch of pieces of rock and stone
and levels where these tunnels

01:56:35.063 --> 01:56:37.535
are emerging and appearing.

01:56:37.535 --> 01:56:44.036
SAM: We know that the cricks have been making
many attacks, so maybe this is where they go,

01:56:44.111 --> 01:56:48.191
this is Grand Central and then they shoot off
to different places to attack.

01:56:48.191 --> 01:56:51.299
LIAM: Or this is an old abandoned place. You know,
I don't know what the right thing to do is because

01:56:51.299 --> 01:56:57.459
if we keep following this tunnel, we could roll
right up into their backyard where they ended

01:56:57.459 --> 01:57:02.764
their journey, walk right into them. However,
we don't really know where this place is going;

01:57:02.764 --> 01:57:08.012
we don't know how far it is from where your
husband is going to be. We don't know

01:57:08.012 --> 01:57:15.598
what dangers are above us. However, we could
come in and try to find him, not walking directly

01:57:15.598 --> 01:57:20.124
into their line of sight, right into their face,
or their butt, or what-have-you.

01:57:20.124 --> 01:57:22.202
I don't know what the right thing to do is.

01:57:22.202 --> 01:57:23.203
SAM: I don't either.

01:57:23.203 --> 01:57:29.973
TRAVIS: My two cents: I think they did a pretty
good job of closing up these tunnels, right? Made

01:57:29.973 --> 01:57:34.777
it so that the average Joe or even someone
able-bodied would be unable to follow them.

01:57:34.777 --> 01:57:38.068
I think this is probably the last place they
think someone would come from.

01:57:38.068 --> 01:57:40.086
Above ground, pretty sure they're covered.

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:42.050
LAURA: That's a good point, Fjord.

01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:43.475
LIAM: That is a good point.

01:57:43.475 --> 01:57:48.086
TALIESIN: I just wish we knew what these things
were. I would have loved to explore some of these.

01:57:48.086 --> 01:57:50.565
TRAVIS: They're small, right? They're small
tunnels.

01:57:50.565 --> 01:57:51.417
MATT: Yeah.

01:57:51.417 --> 01:57:55.988
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, we're already dealing with
the two-body-width tunnel as it is; I don't want

01:57:55.988 --> 01:57:58.582
to shrink it down any lower and really be fucked.

01:57:58.582 --> 01:58:02.966
TALIESIN: My thought was we could send the cat up
and down really quick and just take a look.

01:58:02.966 --> 01:58:03.972
TRAVIS: Send the cat?

01:58:03.972 --> 01:58:07.658
TALIESIN: We have a cat we can just send
down the smaller tunnel really quick.

01:58:07.658 --> 01:58:09.704
I don't know why we don't just take a peek.

01:58:09.704 --> 01:58:11.229
LAURA: That is what we're doing.

01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:13.415
TALIESIN: We sent the cat down the big tunnel.

01:58:13.415 --> 01:58:17.319
MATT: Yeah, the cat continued down the big
tunnel and found that other chamber. The

01:58:17.319 --> 01:58:19.518
tunnel continues past that chamber,
by the way.

01:58:19.518 --> 01:58:21.903
TRAVIS: I thought the cat went up the
small tunnel.

01:58:21.903 --> 01:58:22.658
LAURA: Me too.

01:58:22.658 --> 01:58:24.185
TALIESIN: I had a funny feeling.

01:58:24.185 --> 01:58:28.278
MATT: No, this was Frumpkin going ahead on
the tunnel you guys were traveling and found

01:58:28.278 --> 01:58:31.988
that other chamber, and the tunnel continues
on the other side of this chamber.

01:58:31.988 --> 01:58:35.424
LIAM: We didn't take the side with
Frumpkin. Just confusion, that's fine.

01:58:35.424 --> 01:58:38.875
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's send him up the
small one. That's what I was thinking.

01:58:38.875 --> 01:58:40.204
LAURA: Yeah, bring him back.

01:58:40.204 --> 01:58:44.818
LIAM: Well, he knows to come back in five minutes
if he does not hear from me, so we have to wait.

01:58:44.818 --> 01:58:46.153
MATT: Yep. Frumpkin returns.

01:58:46.153 --> 01:58:50.316
TALIESIN: I'd say the downward one,
just a quick look, not too far down.

01:58:50.316 --> 01:58:52.030
Top one, quick look, not too far up.

01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:53.793
LAURA: Yeah. Go down the little ones?

01:58:53.793 --> 01:59:05.310
MATT: Frumpkin heads into the small side tunnel.
Curves around about 20 or so feet, and then it

01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:17.427
opens up into another small chamber. What Frumpkin
sees is a ten by 15-foot opening area with a pile

01:59:17.427 --> 01:59:24.836
of matted material, like cloth-- it may have been
at one point, but it's soiled. You see two figures

01:59:24.836 --> 01:59:31.155
sitting there. One of them is in the process of
fitting something together or pulling something

01:59:31.155 --> 01:59:42.101
apart, and the other is currently gnawing on some
sort of a long-dried bone. They're tiny, humanoid,

01:59:42.101 --> 01:59:56.840
longer snout, tails, scaly skin. I would say,
lizard- or almost dragon-like, but very tiny.

01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:03.005
They're both sitting in there,
spears set to the side (gnawing noises).

02:00:03.005 --> 02:00:05.798
LIAM: About how far away from me has
Frumpkin gone at this point?

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:07.344
MATT: About 30 or so feet.

02:00:07.344 --> 02:00:11.418
LIAM: 30 or so feet. (snaps fingers)
Pull him back. I don't know

02:00:11.418 --> 02:00:13.683
if they saw him or not; he is glowing.

02:00:13.683 --> 02:00:15.182
MATT and LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:00:15.182 --> 02:00:17.800
MATT: The last thing Frumpkin sees is
them go (hiss).

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:25.624
LIAM: (fwoomp) Little lizard people down
that way, and they saw my cat.

02:00:25.624 --> 02:00:26.944
LAURA: Cool.

02:00:26.944 --> 02:00:28.596
TALIESIN: I'd rather them see us now than--

02:00:28.596 --> 02:00:31.898
TRAVIS: I'll run up and push myself up against
the wall, against where the tunnel is,

02:00:31.898 --> 02:00:34.498
just in case they decide to come out that way.

02:00:34.498 --> 02:00:39.035
LIAM: I will take the other side of it
and do the same thing.

02:00:39.035 --> 02:00:42.021
MATT: Okay. You guys all heading to split
to the sides?

02:00:42.021 --> 02:00:43.689
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to fan out.

02:00:43.689 --> 02:00:47.599
TRAVIS: Do we hear any movement coming
from the tunnel?

02:00:47.599 --> 02:00:57.920
MATT: You hear a (snarling), and you see a
spearhead slowly emerge from the tunnel

02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:06.758
and its head poke out ever so slightly.
Make stealth checks, guys, by the way,

02:01:06.758 --> 02:01:09.212
because this is now going to see you.

02:01:09.212 --> 02:01:13.868
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all
of us while we were hiding. Is that okay?

02:01:13.868 --> 02:01:17.697
MATT: I'll say a straight stealth check on
this one, this happened too quickly.

02:01:17.697 --> 02:01:19.060
LAURA: Okay.

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:20.777
SAM: May I use my cloak?

02:01:20.777 --> 02:01:24.089
MATT: Yeah, your cloak affects any stealth
check you make, for the most part.

02:01:24.089 --> 02:01:27.120
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a six.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:28.243
MATT: Cool.

02:01:28.243 --> 02:01:29.776
TRAVIS: Fjord rolled a 15.

02:01:29.776 --> 02:01:31.264
MARISHA: 17.

02:01:31.264 --> 02:01:32.745
MATT: All right.

02:01:32.745 --> 02:01:34.622
SAM: Caleb?

02:01:34.622 --> 02:01:36.212
LIAM: Oh, a 17.

02:01:36.212 --> 02:01:37.501
SAM: 21.

02:01:37.501 --> 02:01:38.812
LAURA: Eight.

02:01:38.812 --> 02:01:40.201
TALIESIN: 20.

02:01:40.201 --> 02:01:49.464
MATT: Okay. It pokes its head out.
(sniffs) Looks right over towards Fjord

02:01:49.464 --> 02:01:51.471
and goes (questioning chitters).

02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:53.935
TRAVIS: I reach down and grab the spear
and yank it out of its hands!

02:01:53.935 --> 02:01:55.442
MATT: (yelling)

02:01:55.442 --> 02:01:57.243
TRAVIS: What are you?! (yells)

02:01:57.243 --> 02:02:00.676
MATT: The one behind it looks through
and is like (alarmed hiss) and turns around

02:02:00.676 --> 02:02:03.572
and runs down the hall, and the one
that's there is like (panting).

02:02:03.572 --> 02:02:07.717
LIAM: I pull out a small, little stone pyramid
in my hand and mutter a few words

02:02:07.717 --> 02:02:10.968
and then cast Tongues and
speak to this little thing.

02:02:10.968 --> 02:02:16.079
MATT: All right. Well, as you're casting
the spell, you hear the one that ran back

02:02:16.079 --> 02:02:18.569
go like (shouts of alarm).

02:02:18.569 --> 02:02:19.871
LAURA: Oh no.

02:02:19.871 --> 02:02:21.204
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

02:02:21.204 --> 02:02:25.128
MATT: You begin to hear this echoing sound
of lots of claws scurrying their way

02:02:25.128 --> 02:02:26.925
through the nearby tunnels.

02:02:26.925 --> 02:02:28.292
TRAVIS: No! No, no!

02:02:28.395 --> 02:02:30.805
MATT: And that's where we're going to go
and take a break.

02:02:30.805 --> 02:02:32.796
(yelling)

02:02:32.796 --> 02:02:35.333
LIAM: That's the best!

02:02:35.333 --> 02:02:37.813
TALIESIN: We've got to get both out of them.

02:02:37.813 --> 02:02:39.915
MARISHA: Talk to them,
tell them we're friends!

02:02:39.915 --> 02:02:41.369
LAURA: Stop them!

02:02:41.369 --> 02:02:43.900
MATT: We'll come back here in just a moment
to pick up from there.

02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:47.070
LIAM: Did I hear something like,
"Look at these motherfuckers out there!"?

02:02:47.070 --> 02:02:50.559
MATT: As you were casting the spell, this
suddenly happens-- it wasn't finished--

02:02:50.559 --> 02:02:53.515
and when we come back, I'll begin to give you
the idea of what you're beginning to hear.

02:02:53.515 --> 02:02:54.970
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:02:54.970 --> 02:02:59.286
MATT: So we'll be back here in a few minutes from
break. As part of our giveaway, we have these

02:02:59.286 --> 02:03:06.669
really cool custom Valentine's Day dice vaults
here. You can pick up your own special vault.

02:03:06.716 --> 02:03:12.020
They're customized with five wood and inlay
options, and your own message is translated in

02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:16.807
Elvish, which you can see there. They'll arrive
before Valentine's Day if you order before

02:03:16.807 --> 02:03:20.550
February 7th, so you've got to get to that soon.
We're giving away these two tonight, two lucky

02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:28.074
winners. The key word for this is "underground,"
one word, "underground." Come on over to the

02:03:28.074 --> 02:03:31.556
Critical Role Twitch chat, that's
twitch.tv/criticalrole. Enter the word

02:03:31.556 --> 02:03:34.648
"underground" once-- more than once, you'll be
disqualified-- and we'll come back with the

02:03:34.648 --> 02:03:39.295
winners. This is only good, of course, in the
United States and Canada, excluding Quebec.

02:03:39.295 --> 02:03:41.324
But yeah, we'll see you guys here
in a few minutes.

02:03:41.324 --> 02:03:44.606
TRAVIS: Oh shit! What?

02:03:44.606 --> 02:24:33.485
[break]

02:24:33.599 --> 02:24:38.244
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. We have
our two winners for the two dice vaults.

02:24:38.244 --> 02:24:40.961
The first winner is Rickymarooo!

02:24:40.961 --> 02:24:43.607
SAM and TRAVIS: Rickymarooo!

02:24:43.607 --> 02:24:50.205
MATT: The second one, it appears to be--
it's 2r0m0c0. Congratulations, you?

02:24:50.205 --> 02:24:51.495
TRAVIS: Bot username.

02:24:51.875 --> 02:24:53.506
MARISHA: Yeah, bot!

02:24:53.506 --> 02:24:58.158
MATT: We'll get you guys your successful
wins soon. Before I forget,

02:24:58.158 --> 02:25:01.021
I was going to mention it beforehand,
I totally forgot. For those who don't know,

02:25:01.021 --> 02:25:03.505
there's a Rick and Morty versus
Dungeons and Dragons comic book.

02:25:03.505 --> 02:25:04.952
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

02:25:04.952 --> 02:25:07.062
MATT: They just released the fourth and
final issue. It's written by our friend

02:25:07.062 --> 02:25:11.260
of the show, Patrick Rothfuss, if you
remember from campaign one.

02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:16.496
ALL: (mimicking Matt) Patrick Rothfuss.

02:25:16.556 --> 02:25:18.040
LAURA: Author extraordinaire.

02:25:18.097 --> 02:25:22.778
MATT: Patrick Rothfuss! Drawn by Jim Zub.
It's a great team, and a number of people

02:25:22.778 --> 02:25:30.090
from the community make little cameos in it.
Our friend and love of all D&amp;D, Chris Perkins,

02:25:30.090 --> 02:25:33.676
is in it, Satine's in it. Apparently I'm in
this issue? Which is kind of nuts. So yeah.

02:25:33.676 --> 02:25:38.249
It's pretty awesome, you should
check it out if you have the opportunity.

02:25:38.249 --> 02:25:40.075
TALIESIN: It's pretty great.

02:25:40.105 --> 02:25:44.430
MATT: It's pretty awesome. Gary Gygax's
ghost says a fun phrase.

02:25:44.447 --> 02:25:46.853
TRAVIS: Same page as you.

02:25:46.853 --> 02:25:55.284
MATT: Indeed. Anyway. Getting back into the
insanity, you had just grabbed the spear from a

02:25:55.284 --> 02:26:01.001
nearby kobold as the other one rushed off. I would
like for you to make a strength check, please.

02:26:01.001 --> 02:26:05.505
TRAVIS: Oh, good. This is my forte these days.

02:26:05.583 --> 02:26:08.343
MARISHA: You were just lifting so many
pebbles, you'll be great.

02:26:09.516 --> 02:26:11.146
TRAVIS: 11.

02:26:11.146 --> 02:26:14.150
SAM: Against a tiny little thing.

02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:18.125
MATT: No. You grab its spear and it goes (yell).

02:26:18.125 --> 02:26:20.673
TRAVIS: Fuck! That's so embarrassing!

02:26:20.673 --> 02:26:25.938
MATT: And pulls it back from you as you hear the
mounting skittering of numerous creatures now

02:26:25.938 --> 02:26:31.462
coming from behind where you were and from
the nearby tunnels. What are you guys doing?

02:26:31.462 --> 02:26:35.884
LIAM: Wait, just to specify, from up where
Frumpkin just was, from that direction?

02:26:35.884 --> 02:26:37.174
Or multiple directions?

02:26:37.174 --> 02:26:38.476
MATT: Multiple directions, behind you.

02:26:38.476 --> 02:26:39.944
LIAM: They're in the honeycombs in
the ceiling, right?

02:26:39.944 --> 02:26:40.612
MATT: Apparently.

02:26:40.612 --> 02:26:41.802
LIAM: Yeah.

02:26:41.802 --> 02:26:45.513
LAURA: I cast Disguise Self and
make myself look like a giant one of them.

02:26:45.513 --> 02:26:48.248
MARISHA: Oh man, not again!

02:26:48.248 --> 02:26:50.350
TRAVIS: We should run. We should go.

02:26:50.350 --> 02:26:52.311
TALIESIN: Let's head to the tunnel,
then head to the main room.

02:26:52.311 --> 02:26:53.383
TRAVIS: Just run forward.

02:26:53.383 --> 02:26:55.268
MARISHA: (yelling)

02:26:55.268 --> 02:26:57.812
MATT: As you're casting the spell,
transforming into a larger kobold,

02:26:57.812 --> 02:27:02.706
you start rushing forward. Are you guys
all heading forward with Fjord?

02:27:02.706 --> 02:27:04.753
MARISHA: I will head forward--

02:27:04.753 --> 02:27:06.169
LIAM: Mage Armor.

02:27:06.169 --> 02:27:10.859
MARISHA: -- but power walking
like a badass, strolling behind, in case

02:27:10.859 --> 02:27:13.007
I want to deck some kobolds in the face.

02:27:13.007 --> 02:27:18.684
MATT: Okay. You guys charge forward around the
corner into the next chamber. That chamber has

02:27:18.684 --> 02:27:24.735
about 20 or so kobolds that have emerged from, or
are in the process of emerging from, the different

02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:34.765
tunnels, that are all facing your direction with
small, dinged blades and crossbows that look like

02:27:34.765 --> 02:27:41.160
they might work. Spears, and small leather and
wood shields, and they all fill the chamber

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:47.008
in front of you, going (chittering, snarling).
They're holding the line. What are you doing?

02:27:47.008 --> 02:27:52.282
LIAM: We have come to speak, I say, in whatever
language I now understand and speak.

02:27:52.282 --> 02:27:53.456
TALIESIN: I'm going to augment that.

02:27:53.456 --> 02:27:55.556
LAURA: I act like I'm saying it.

02:27:58.383 --> 02:28:00.887
LIAM: Oh, I made it very clear and held my hand.

02:28:00.887 --> 02:28:05.163
MATT: Yeah. There's definitely a confused division
and attention here as they're like (chittering).

02:28:05.163 --> 02:28:07.183
TRAVIS: World of magic and mystery!

02:28:07.183 --> 02:28:09.656
TALIESIN: They can all hear you.

02:28:09.656 --> 02:28:16.830
LIAM: We have come through to chase a large
serpent through these caves and eradicate it.

02:28:17.192 --> 02:28:22.096
MATT: The ones behind Beau-- as you're strolling
up and he's shouting this out, there are about ten

02:28:22.096 --> 02:28:26.729
or so kobolds that begin to rush up from behind,
and they see you, and they slow their step and

02:28:26.729 --> 02:28:30.578
start taking their spears and prodding you
to join the rest of the people.

02:28:30.578 --> 02:28:33.797
LAURA: Also, tell them that I'm their god.

02:28:33.797 --> 02:28:35.531
LIAM: Easy.

02:28:36.908 --> 02:28:41.931
MATT: There's one in the center. Of all of them
that are there, there's one that is covered in

02:28:41.931 --> 02:28:46.901
cages and boxes and leather straps. There's
another that has heavy pieces of armor,

02:28:46.901 --> 02:28:54.044
almost weighing him down. You see others that look
like skirmishers that are all gathered around,

02:28:54.044 --> 02:29:00.685
and they all have this growling, barking energy.
They look a bit hungry, a bit sallow,

02:29:00.685 --> 02:29:05.745
and the one that's in the full armor steps forward
towards you and you and is looking

02:29:05.745 --> 02:29:08.089
back and forth and gives you this curious look.

02:29:08.089 --> 02:29:18.357
LIAM: We are here looking for a scourge
in these mountains. Oh boy.

02:29:18.357 --> 02:29:23.157
We mean you no harm. We wish to pass through.

02:29:24.725 --> 02:29:29.057
MATT: (grunts) You hear him say,
in Draconic, "Come forth, loud meal."

02:29:29.057 --> 02:29:32.060
TRAVIS: Nice, Draconic!

02:29:32.060 --> 02:29:37.364
LAURA: Oh man, I was trying to make it
look like I was talking, Caleb! Argh!

02:29:37.439 --> 02:29:41.150
MATT: There are a number that are
staring at you in half awe, like--

02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:42.674
TRAVIS: Deity!

02:29:43.291 --> 02:29:49.066
LIAM: In Draconic, saying-- well,
through the spell: I am one meal,

02:29:49.066 --> 02:29:54.102
but my friends can make more
food than me. I am--

02:29:54.102 --> 02:29:55.375
MATT: Do you approach?

02:29:55.375 --> 02:29:56.546
LIAM: I take two steps forward.

02:29:56.546 --> 02:29:58.077
MATT: All right, make a dexterity saving throw.

02:29:58.077 --> 02:29:59.407
LIAM: Okay.

02:30:00.516 --> 02:30:03.171
MARISHA: What? Why though?

02:30:03.564 --> 02:30:06.872
LIAM: Two steps forward-- that's an 11.

02:30:06.872 --> 02:30:12.746
MATT: As you're saying this with intensity and
force, you guys watch as suddenly there's a cloud

02:30:12.746 --> 02:30:20.850
of dust around his ankles, and a rope loop wraps
and pulls your legs together and hoists you up,

02:30:20.850 --> 02:30:25.722
and you're now dangling about three,
four feet off the ground.

02:30:25.722 --> 02:30:30.687
LIAM: I only take this as a minor setback.
We can still work this out.

02:30:30.687 --> 02:30:34.737
MATT: At which point all the kobolds--
there's this large wave of cackles.

02:30:34.737 --> 02:30:37.752
The one raises his hand up and
they all get quiet and he goes--

02:30:37.752 --> 02:30:39.614
TALIESIN: That's pretty funny!

02:30:39.614 --> 02:30:41.542
MARISHA: That's pretty good!

02:30:41.542 --> 02:30:47.211
MATT: "You! Loud food!"
Points at the rest of you.

02:30:47.211 --> 02:30:51.661
MARISHA: You're just dangling.

02:30:51.661 --> 02:30:57.295
MATT: "You want pass?" Yep, as your hair is just
dripping there and you're slowly (creaking).

02:30:57.295 --> 02:31:01.118
LAURA: His coat up. Yeah.

02:31:01.895 --> 02:31:06.402
MATT: He's following you with this nasty looking
shortsword that looks like the edges of it

02:31:06.402 --> 02:31:11.244
are grimed up with black oil or something.

02:31:11.772 --> 02:31:18.089
LIAM: You do not want to tangle with the spirits I
command. I snap my fingers and Frumpkin appears,

02:31:18.089 --> 02:31:24.387
and four globules of light float
in a circle around Frumpkin.

02:31:25.665 --> 02:31:28.461
MATT: "Ugh!" Takes a step back.
Make an intimidation check.

02:31:29.497 --> 02:31:31.105
TRAVIS: Upside down.

02:31:31.839 --> 02:31:35.100
MARISHA: Beware the spirit of the Maine Coon.

02:31:36.072 --> 02:31:38.557
LIAM: Intimidation? That's a 19.

02:31:38.557 --> 02:31:45.000
MATT: "He who summoned kitty spirit."

02:31:47.218 --> 02:31:50.516
LIAM: You will be cursed for decades.

02:31:50.516 --> 02:31:53.216
MATT: "We already cursed!"

02:31:53.216 --> 02:31:54.815
LAURA: What does it say?

02:31:54.815 --> 02:32:07.699
MATT: "You in no position. You in <i>that</i> position.
So you give one to feed, or trade for food."

02:32:07.699 --> 02:32:13.488
He's looking at you. He's making this challenge
to you, but is definitely keeping a distance,

02:32:13.488 --> 02:32:17.970
and is taking a step back from where he was
standing so confidently in your direction.

02:32:17.970 --> 02:32:21.047
LIAM: You expect me to hand over one of my own?

02:32:22.533 --> 02:32:23.849
MATT: "Yes!"

02:32:23.849 --> 02:32:31.379
LIAM: This cat will burn you-- burn you all.

02:32:31.379 --> 02:32:33.736
LAURA: He sounds very intimidating right now.

02:32:33.736 --> 02:32:34.456
TALIESIN: I heard that, right?

02:32:34.456 --> 02:32:35.133
MATT: Yeah--

02:32:35.133 --> 02:32:38.983
LIAM: No, it's in Drac-- well, I don't know.
I'm speaking through a spell, so--

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:40.074
TALIESIN: Oh. Yeah.

02:32:40.074 --> 02:32:43.457
MATT: Looking at the specifics of Tongues here.

02:32:43.457 --> 02:32:45.206
SAM: Tongues.

02:32:50.711 --> 02:32:52.797
MATT: "Any creature that knows at least one
language can hear and understand it,"

02:32:52.797 --> 02:32:54.845
so it's not so much that you're speaking
Draconic, but any creature that knows

02:32:54.845 --> 02:32:56.565
language can understand you.
So all of you hear this.

02:32:56.565 --> 02:32:57.651
LIAM: So we're all on the same page.

02:32:57.651 --> 02:32:58.193
MATT: Yes.

02:32:58.193 --> 02:32:59.396
LIAM: Oh, that's excellent.

02:32:59.396 --> 02:33:00.647
LAURA: Yay! We can make food.

02:33:00.647 --> 02:33:02.126
TALIESIN: We can't understand them,
but we can understand you.

02:33:02.126 --> 02:33:04.260
MATT: Actually, strangely enough,
it's speaking in broken Common.

02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:06.409
TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh.

02:33:06.409 --> 02:33:15.320
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, we can make some food
I suppose, or we can let the cat have his way.

02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:20.477
Is there any way I can just add a Thaumaturgy
effect to the cat really quickly?

02:33:20.477 --> 02:33:22.091
MATT: How so? What do you want to enhance?

02:33:22.091 --> 02:33:25.421
TALIESIN: I want the ground around the cat
to shake gently and start having

02:33:25.421 --> 02:33:28.240
a minor earthquake effect.

02:33:28.498 --> 02:33:31.746
LIAM: Frumpkin stands and does that little--

02:33:31.746 --> 02:33:34.881
MATT: As Frumpkin does that, and the rocks shake
and tumble around in this small quaking noise,

02:33:34.881 --> 02:33:38.993
about six of the nearby kobolds go (gasping),
and start skitting away from it,

02:33:38.993 --> 02:33:43.161
holding their weapons at bay. Two of them in
the tunnels all of a sudden go (squeaking),

02:33:43.161 --> 02:33:44.500
and climb up in the tunnels and vanish.

02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:45.534
LAURA: Aww!

02:33:45.534 --> 02:33:47.332
TALIESIN: We have food, though.

02:33:47.332 --> 02:33:57.080
LAURA: Yes, little me's, we have food for you!
Worship me! I am your leader!

02:33:57.080 --> 02:33:58.733
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:33:58.733 --> 02:33:59.953
SAM: "I am your leader!"

02:33:59.953 --> 02:34:01.591
TALIESIN: Oh lord.

02:34:01.591 --> 02:34:03.539
LAURA and TALIESIN: Ah!

02:34:03.539 --> 02:34:05.406
LAURA: 12.

02:34:05.406 --> 02:34:09.524
MATT: You see two of them begin to reach towards
you, like-- (excited breathing).

02:34:09.524 --> 02:34:10.985
LAURA: Yes!

02:34:10.985 --> 02:34:14.628
MATT: The one in the full armor goes,
"No pay attention!" and slaps them

02:34:14.628 --> 02:34:18.543
with his spear and they (snarl).

02:34:18.543 --> 02:34:20.276
TRAVIS: How about the food?

02:34:20.276 --> 02:34:22.338
LAURA: We bring food for you.

02:34:22.338 --> 02:34:23.757
MATT: "Trade!"

02:34:23.757 --> 02:34:30.974
TALIESIN: We'll need containers. Do you
have a couple of pots? Big containers.

02:34:30.974 --> 02:34:36.671
MATT: "Sybil!" Points to one in there and you see
this one kobold that's covered in rags-- kind of

02:34:36.671 --> 02:34:43.574
looks like the collector lady from Labyrinth--
and pulls out this large, billowing leather sack

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:48.828
that's stained of all sorts of colors around its
basis. (heavy breathing) It holds it up. Its jaw

02:34:48.828 --> 02:34:55.436
is slightly dislodged on one side and gives it
this crooked grin to its face. Holds it open.

02:34:55.436 --> 02:35:00.600
TALIESIN: Do you have one more? I can do two,
if you've got two. I can do water, also.

02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:02.843
Do you care about water? I can do water.

02:35:02.843 --> 02:35:04.433
MATT: "We have water."

02:35:04.433 --> 02:35:05.198
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:35:05.198 --> 02:35:06.903
MATT: "Fill food!"

02:35:06.903 --> 02:35:15.137
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a little piece
of fungus off the stick, and I'm going to

02:35:15.137 --> 02:35:17.556
put it in there, and I'm going to start
casting Create Food and Water

02:35:17.556 --> 02:35:22.004
and it's going to suddenly become
45 pounds of food.

02:35:22.004 --> 02:35:25.783
MATT: (thudding) The thing all of a sudden slams
into the ground, the heavy weight from the

02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:32.256
summoned meal hitting the heavy rock floor.
As soon as that kobold leans forward,

02:35:32.256 --> 02:35:37.126
pulled off of his feet and manages to stumble
into it and look inside. (sniffs) "Whoa!"

02:35:37.126 --> 02:35:41.972
Begins to shovel it. The leader then goes,
"Stop! We eat!"

02:35:41.972 --> 02:35:44.606
TALIESIN and LAURA: It's good.

02:35:45.286 --> 02:35:49.921
MATT: "Two may pass. More food
for trade rest. Huh?"

02:35:49.921 --> 02:35:57.340
LIAM: The Fey King is growing angry with you, and
the globules of light start to spin a little quicker.

02:35:57.340 --> 02:36:00.392
TALIESIN: A little more thunder maybe.

02:36:00.392 --> 02:36:03.848
MATT: "Two and the Fey King can also pass."

02:36:03.848 --> 02:36:07.872
LAURA: What about the leader-- your leader?
Can I go?

02:36:07.872 --> 02:36:12.481
MATT: You see the others all nervously looking
towards the other, and you can see him feeling

02:36:12.481 --> 02:36:18.094
really intimidated by your presence. There's this
idea of him being the head of this sect and you

02:36:18.094 --> 02:36:23.321
storming in here, and he's just-- this jealous
intensity as it stares towards you and goes,

02:36:23.321 --> 02:36:29.937
"Do not listen! Why you come?"

02:36:29.937 --> 02:36:34.010
LAURA: I came because I'm a really good
friend of yours. I'm a leader here,

02:36:34.010 --> 02:36:39.100
and also I just wanted to go
through with my friends?

02:36:40.492 --> 02:36:43.195
MATT: "False leader may go as well!"

02:36:43.195 --> 02:36:45.179
LAURA: Yes!

02:36:45.179 --> 02:36:48.224
TRAVIS: We have two gator skins
in the bag of holding.

02:36:48.224 --> 02:36:49.937
MATT: "What? Gator?"

02:36:49.937 --> 02:36:50.729
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:36:50.729 --> 02:36:51.421
MATT: "What?"

02:36:51.421 --> 02:36:54.400
TRAVIS: Are you interested in gator?
It's like real tough leather.

02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:55.797
I mean, bet you could use it as some--

02:36:55.797 --> 02:36:57.516
TALIESIN: I don't think they'd be interested.
It's way too nice for them.

02:36:57.516 --> 02:36:58.994
I don't think that they really--

02:36:58.994 --> 02:37:02.378
MATT: You can see four other mouths watering
as you're describing this tough gator skin.

02:37:02.378 --> 02:37:05.142
TALIESIN: That's so expensive and difficult
to come by, in this part of the world.

02:37:05.142 --> 02:37:07.221
TRAVIS: I know, yeah, it's so rare. I mean, maybe
it's better we just hold onto the gator.

02:37:07.221 --> 02:37:08.853
TALIESIN: You don't want-- I mean, we certainly
don't want to give it up.

02:37:08.853 --> 02:37:10.061
MATT: "Give us gator skin!"

02:37:10.061 --> 02:37:11.379
TALIESIN: Well.

02:37:11.379 --> 02:37:14.675
TRAVIS: I don't know. I mean, I could maybe part
with one for the rest of us--

02:37:14.675 --> 02:37:16.320
MATT: "No! All of it!"

02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:22.133
TRAVIS: Well, all right. I pull out two
gator skins. My friends will

02:37:22.133 --> 02:37:24.840
have to be able to go on their way.

02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:27.220
TALIESIN: Mister Fjord, are you sure?

02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:30.381
TRAVIS: I mean, I hate to. They're worth
a fortune and, boy, the protection

02:37:30.381 --> 02:37:40.988
that they yield, mmm dogie. Ah-- okay.

02:37:42.392 --> 02:37:50.470
MATT: (satisfied grunt) Puts it over the side
pouch of one of the other ones-- carries it and,

02:37:50.470 --> 02:37:54.170
(excited grunt). Is that both of them?

02:37:54.170 --> 02:37:55.603
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:37:55.603 --> 02:37:58.167
LAURA: That's all of us then, huh?
We can go then?

02:37:58.167 --> 02:38:01.169
TALIESIN: Yeah, because there was the two,
and then the other two, and then the king,

02:38:01.169 --> 02:38:02.157
and the leader.

02:38:02.157 --> 02:38:03.389
LAURA: Then the leader, and then
we had the friends with the--

02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:04.980
SAM: I'm only a half, really. I'm half.

02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:07.431
LAURA: Then the guy that's hanging.
That's important, too.

02:38:07.431 --> 02:38:09.780
TALIESIN: I think that's half of the next person,
that comes through at that point.

02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:11.065
LAURA: Definitely.

02:38:11.065 --> 02:38:18.404
MATT: One of them steps forward and goes,
"I think that is--" "Shh! I'm making number!"

02:38:18.404 --> 02:38:23.790
SAM: I can also offer you this-- I have a pouch of
smoking tobacco. You could smoke this

02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:27.869
and it will make you forget your troubles.

02:38:28.806 --> 02:38:33.442
MATT: It leans forward towards you, giving a look
and goes, "You (sniffs), goblin."

02:38:33.442 --> 02:38:36.944
SAM: Yes.

02:38:37.879 --> 02:38:40.166
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:38:41.355 --> 02:38:42.897
SAM: Jesus. 17.

02:38:42.897 --> 02:38:44.589
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:38:44.589 --> 02:38:47.589
MATT: Takes the pouch from you. (sniffs)

02:38:47.589 --> 02:38:55.089
SAM: No. Don't eat it. It's for smoking, really.
You can eat it. Ugh!

02:38:58.092 --> 02:39:00.416
MATT: "Accepted."

02:39:00.416 --> 02:39:01.622
SAM: All right.

02:39:01.622 --> 02:39:07.259
MATT: Takes and places it in the pouch.
"(shouting Draconic)," it shouts.

02:39:07.259 --> 02:39:11.709
You being able to recognize, saying,
"All right, let them pass."

02:39:11.709 --> 02:39:17.983
MARISHA: I jump down and take out one of
my shurikens and chop Caleb free.

02:39:17.983 --> 02:39:20.299
MATT: (thudding) Like a sack of potatoes.

02:39:20.299 --> 02:39:21.620
LIAM: Is that 1d6?

02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:25.340
MATT: From that height? Yeah, that would
be four points of bludgeoning damage.

02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:26.603
MARISHA: Ah, jeez.

02:39:26.603 --> 02:39:30.468
TALIESIN: I'm just making sure nobody's tried to--
I've been trying to keep an eye on things.

02:39:30.468 --> 02:39:32.127
LAURA: Yeah, I don't want them ganking our stuff.

02:39:32.127 --> 02:39:33.958
TALIESIN: Nobody's tried to gank anything, right?

02:39:33.958 --> 02:39:35.532
LAURA: I've got my hands on our stuff
the whole time.

02:39:35.532 --> 02:39:37.905
MATT: Okay. You're keeping watch, and a few do get
close and they're definitely eyeing the various

02:39:37.905 --> 02:39:41.922
trinkets that dangle from your belts, but as any
of them start getting close you grab and they pull

02:39:41.922 --> 02:39:50.466
back. The leader goes, "Go. Follow path of big
worm. Make big mess. Go!"

02:39:50.466 --> 02:39:51.753
LAURA: Nugget, come on!

02:39:51.753 --> 02:39:52.744
TRAVIS: Wait, a path the big one?

02:39:52.744 --> 02:39:53.969
MARISHA: Make big mess?

02:39:53.969 --> 02:40:00.857
LAURA: Oh yeah, question about that: Did you see
how many of them there were with the big worm?

02:40:00.857 --> 02:40:04.173
MATT: Just looking at you angrily, this--

02:40:04.173 --> 02:40:06.168
LAURA: The guys that made a big mess?

02:40:06.168 --> 02:40:08.819
MATT: "Big mess. Move through. No longer here."

02:40:08.819 --> 02:40:11.904
LAURA: How long ago, do you know?

02:40:11.904 --> 02:40:13.631
MATT: "Days, weeks."

02:40:13.631 --> 02:40:16.925
LAURA: Did it seem like a lot of people?

02:40:16.925 --> 02:40:19.378
MATT: "Very loud. Ruin tunnel."

02:40:19.378 --> 02:40:21.230
LAURA: How big was the worm?

02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:23.558
MATT: "Very big."

02:40:23.558 --> 02:40:27.084
SAM: They're very small though, so in relation to
them it may well be--

02:40:27.084 --> 02:40:29.000
LAURA: That's true, it's kind of--

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.148
TRAVIS: Ask them if they've been all the way to
the end of the--

02:40:31.148 --> 02:40:32.047
SAM: You can ask them.

02:40:32.047 --> 02:40:33.167
LAURA: They understand us.

02:40:33.167 --> 02:40:37.405
TRAVIS: Have you been all the way to the end of
big mess tunnel?

02:40:37.405 --> 02:40:39.011
MATT: "No. No go."

02:40:39.011 --> 02:40:39.790
TRAVIS: Why not?

02:40:39.790 --> 02:40:43.276
MATT: "Stay here, home. Eat food from you."

02:40:43.276 --> 02:40:45.792
TALIESIN: That is fair.

02:40:45.792 --> 02:40:50.206
LIAM: Do you know who is caged up, aways down this
tunnel?

02:40:50.206 --> 02:40:55.145
MATT: "What?" Points over to the small cage with
the little creature, you mean?

02:40:55.145 --> 02:40:56.445
LIAM: Oh, it's in this room?

02:40:56.445 --> 02:40:57.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, we ran forward.

02:40:57.674 --> 02:40:59.123
LIAM: Oh, I see. Got it.

02:40:59.123 --> 02:41:01.497
TRAVIS: Yeah, what is in that cage?

02:41:01.497 --> 02:41:03.897
MATT: "Is food."

02:41:03.897 --> 02:41:06.786
LAURA: No, don't eat it!

02:41:06.786 --> 02:41:08.329
SAM: Is it cute, or not?

02:41:08.329 --> 02:41:09.983
MATT: It's pretty ragged.

02:41:09.983 --> 02:41:14.404
TRAVIS: Are we going to pass judgment
on this thing? Come on!

02:41:14.404 --> 02:41:17.593
Let's just keep going and turn a blind eye.

02:41:17.593 --> 02:41:19.657
TALIESIN: Is the cage locked, or is it just shut?

02:41:19.657 --> 02:41:21.703
MATT: From this distance, it looks closed.

02:41:21.703 --> 02:41:26.333
SAM: If you rescue this thing,
could it be cute ever?

02:41:26.333 --> 02:41:28.876
MATT: With a little TLC, maybe.

02:41:28.876 --> 02:41:32.207
LAURA: I mean, we shouldn't let it just die.

02:41:32.207 --> 02:41:34.845
MATT: You're not even sure what kind of
creature it is. It kind of resembles

02:41:34.845 --> 02:41:40.809
a squirrel, kind of resembles a small dog,
but it's greasy and ratty and--

02:41:40.809 --> 02:41:42.471
SAM: Trade your dog for it.

02:41:42.471 --> 02:41:44.064
LAURA: I'm not going to trade Nugget, no!

02:41:44.064 --> 02:41:45.354
SAM: Just trade Nugget for it.

02:41:45.354 --> 02:41:46.199
LAURA: No.

02:41:46.199 --> 02:41:48.346
TALIESIN: Are we going to be walking
within 30 feet of that cage?

02:41:48.346 --> 02:41:49.954
MATT: Most likely, yeah.

02:41:49.954 --> 02:41:51.753
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

02:41:51.753 --> 02:41:58.543
LIAM: I tell you what. Do you want this creature?

02:41:58.543 --> 02:42:02.280
LAURA: I mean, I don't want it to
suffer in a cage, Caleb.

02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:09.228
LIAM: I will make one last offering to you.
I will give you the Fey King,

02:42:09.228 --> 02:42:12.689
in exchange for this creature here.

02:42:12.689 --> 02:42:14.523
SAM: The cat? No, you can't!

02:42:14.523 --> 02:42:15.899
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:42:15.899 --> 02:42:18.915
TRAVIS: I know where you're going with this.
This is going to backfire.

02:42:18.915 --> 02:42:21.722
LIAM: Deception, you said?

02:42:21.722 --> 02:42:22.559
MATT: Yes.

02:42:22.559 --> 02:42:23.502
LIAM: 16.

02:42:23.502 --> 02:42:29.577
MATT: 16? "You can give Fey King?"

02:42:29.577 --> 02:42:34.037
LIAM: He will bring blessings to your people.

02:42:34.951 --> 02:42:37.535
MATT: "Take food, keep king."

02:42:37.535 --> 02:42:52.557
LIAM: Okay. Take the f-- okay. Telepathically, I
tell Frumpkin: I'll bring you back in one day,

02:42:52.557 --> 02:42:57.378
buddy. In my head, and he trods forward.

02:42:57.378 --> 02:43:09.852
MATT: Okay, picks up the Fey King from the scruff
of the neck and goes, "You I eat. Gain power.

02:43:10.029 --> 02:43:12.791
"Bigger than that one. False leader."

02:43:12.791 --> 02:43:16.529
MATT and LAURA: (snarling)

02:43:16.529 --> 02:43:22.425
MATT: "Let go!" All of them pull back and begin to
disappear into the tunnels behind, and you guys

02:43:22.425 --> 02:43:23.779
are given a path through.

02:43:23.779 --> 02:43:26.685
LIAM: We have food, the creature in the cage?

02:43:26.685 --> 02:43:28.177
MATT: The cage is just right there.

02:43:28.177 --> 02:43:29.017
LIAM: I pick it up.

02:43:29.017 --> 02:43:30.087
LAURA: Let's open it up.

02:43:30.087 --> 02:43:31.875
SAM and MARISHA: Take the whole cage.

02:43:31.875 --> 02:43:34.699
TALIESIN: Once the cage is within 30 feet, I'm
just going to pop it open with Thaumaturgy.

02:43:34.699 --> 02:43:39.423
MATT: Okay, the creature immediately jumps out
(shrieks), and darts off down the tunnel.

02:43:39.423 --> 02:43:41.751
MARISHA: Ah, it's rabies.

02:43:41.751 --> 02:43:44.416
LAURA: Yay, it's alive. Thanks, Caleb!

02:43:44.416 --> 02:43:46.156
TALIESIN: Bye, buddy.

02:43:46.156 --> 02:43:50.028
MARISHA: The thing is going to die in ten more
feet from something else.

02:43:50.028 --> 02:43:51.715
TALIESIN: It's going to be like one of those
YouTube videos, where they

02:43:51.715 --> 02:43:55.099
let the mouse go in the forest
and just the hawk-- like ten feet.

02:43:55.099 --> 02:43:57.106
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:43:57.106 --> 02:43:58.574
MATT: You guys continue on the path?

02:43:58.574 --> 02:43:59.672
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:43:59.672 --> 02:44:00.979
TALIESIN: It didn't last one day.

02:44:00.979 --> 02:44:04.181
MATT: As you're leaving, Caduceus, you notice,
that the leader leans over to two other kobolds,

02:44:04.181 --> 02:44:06.781
and whispers something to them.

02:44:06.781 --> 02:44:08.394
TALIESIN: What do I hear?

02:44:08.394 --> 02:44:12.815
MATT: You hear a low muttering, but
not in a language you understand.

02:44:12.815 --> 02:44:20.890
TALIESIN: That's interesting. Can your cat
hear what they're talking about?

02:44:20.890 --> 02:44:25.088
LIAM: Sure, but I'm not zooming
into him right now.

02:44:25.088 --> 02:44:29.097
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to walk by you and
be like: They're talking about something.

02:44:29.097 --> 02:44:31.831
I don't know if we want to keep an ear out
for what they're up to.

02:44:31.831 --> 02:44:34.184
LIAM: (swoosh)

02:44:34.184 --> 02:44:35.947
MATT: So what was that?

02:44:35.947 --> 02:44:39.782
LIAM: Oh, I just jumped into the Fey King really
quick to see if anything was happening.

02:44:39.782 --> 02:44:44.033
MATT: Okay, after you guys leave, everyone
scatters into the chambers, but stays behind

02:44:44.033 --> 02:44:51.500
and watches, and two of the kobolds slowly begin
to follow behind the group in the tunnel after you.

02:44:51.500 --> 02:44:52.998
LAURA: Yeah.

02:44:52.998 --> 02:44:54.690
TALIESIN: Cool.

02:44:54.690 --> 02:44:57.302
MARISHA: Let's let them do it for a little bit.

02:44:57.302 --> 02:45:02.907
MATT: One of them is the one that's covered in all
the different boxes and pouches.

02:45:02.907 --> 02:45:08.826
There's a staff and it has an actual small cage,
like the one that you just opened, on its side

02:45:08.826 --> 02:45:13.570
with something inside it. The other one just
looks to be a small spear-holding scout

02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:18.582
and they're both being quiet as they can, but
the one carrying everything isn't very quiet.

02:45:18.582 --> 02:45:21.176
SAM: They're on our tail?

02:45:21.176 --> 02:45:26.578
MATT: Caduceus, you can hear the gentle
clanging of various accessories of this kobold

02:45:26.578 --> 02:45:29.608
trying to be quiet, pursuing you down the tunnel.

02:45:29.608 --> 02:45:32.780
TALIESIN: As long as they're
keeping some distance.

02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:35.928
SAM: Want me to take them out? Or at least--

02:45:35.928 --> 02:45:37.029
TALIESIN: Not yet.

02:45:37.029 --> 02:45:38.203
SAM: Disarm them?

02:45:38.203 --> 02:45:40.452
LIAM: Let's lead them away from the pack.

02:45:40.452 --> 02:45:43.336
MARISHA: They might have useful information.

02:45:43.336 --> 02:45:47.769
LAURA: They're so cute.

02:45:47.769 --> 02:45:50.577
TRAVIS: I don't think that's accurate.

02:45:50.577 --> 02:45:52.495
SAM: They both have weapons?

02:45:52.495 --> 02:45:54.654
MATT: Well, one of them is just covered in--

02:45:54.654 --> 02:45:55.393
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:45:55.393 --> 02:46:00.075
MATT: --random shit. The other one has a spear.
You travel for about an hour or so, away from

02:46:00.075 --> 02:46:06.608
that, the tunnel continuing before you. They're
still staying back by about 60 or so feet.

02:46:06.608 --> 02:46:09.446
MARISHA: Oh, so they're not even
being secretive about it.

02:46:09.446 --> 02:46:12.172
MATT and MARISHA: They think they are.

02:46:12.172 --> 02:46:14.267
TRAVIS: They're watching us leave.
They're escorting us out.

02:46:14.267 --> 02:46:15.307
MARISHA: Got it.

02:46:15.307 --> 02:46:18.719
TALIESIN: I think at some point-- When's
the point where it's time to bed down?

02:46:18.719 --> 02:46:20.604
Are we getting to that point?

02:46:20.604 --> 02:46:23.116
MATT: I'd say you're probably within
another hour or so of that.

02:46:23.116 --> 02:46:26.067
TALIESIN: I think at some point
we're going to "bed down."

02:46:26.067 --> 02:46:27.525
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:46:27.525 --> 02:46:32.998
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:46:32.998 --> 02:46:35.338
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

02:46:35.338 --> 02:46:37.032
LAURA: Yeah, and then we'll go to sleep?

02:46:37.032 --> 02:46:38.688
TALIESIN: And then we'll go to sleep.

02:46:38.688 --> 02:46:40.005
SAM: "Go to sleep."

02:46:40.005 --> 02:46:44.684
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Good idea.

02:46:44.684 --> 02:46:50.720
MATT: All right. So you guys eventually reach that
point and you begin to bed down. What do you do?

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:55.093
TALIESIN: I'm just going to-- I think we should--

02:46:55.093 --> 02:46:57.988
LAURA: Put on a show. I think
they need some entertainment.

02:46:57.988 --> 02:46:59.800
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:00.819
LAURA: Yeah.

02:47:00.819 --> 02:47:06.926
MARISHA: You mean like as in: (projecting)
Hey! We should go to sleep! Like that?

02:47:06.926 --> 02:47:10.742
LAURA: Yes! Oh, I'm feeling so tired.

02:47:10.742 --> 02:47:13.277
MARISHA: My feet, they hurt.

02:47:13.277 --> 02:47:19.089
LAURA: Also, I'm not a giant lizard anymore.
I'm not a big kobold. I'm me again.

02:47:19.089 --> 02:47:21.528
MARISHA: Because you're a god!

02:47:21.528 --> 02:47:24.497
LAURA: That's right, I can take any form I want.

02:47:24.497 --> 02:47:27.707
MARISHA: I'm glad to see your
true form, mistress!

02:47:27.707 --> 02:47:31.996
LAURA: Yes! I'm glad everyone worships me
like they should.

02:47:31.996 --> 02:47:37.360
SAM: While they're shouting at each other,
I'm going to turn invisible.

02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:38.707
MATT: Okay.

02:47:38.707 --> 02:47:39.586
TRAVIS: There you go.

02:47:39.586 --> 02:47:41.255
SAM: And I'm going to sneak back there.

02:47:41.255 --> 02:47:42.089
MATT: Okay.

02:47:42.089 --> 02:47:43.828
SAM: Back towards them.

02:47:43.828 --> 02:47:47.725
MATT: Do you guys... lay down?
What do you do?

02:47:47.725 --> 02:47:51.335
LAURA: I walk around dramatically for a while.

02:47:51.335 --> 02:47:54.387
TRAVIS: Is the dome out?
Are we summoning the whole thing?

02:47:54.387 --> 02:47:55.966
MATT: Is the dome out or are you waiting?

02:47:55.966 --> 02:47:57.863
LIAM: I have not done that yet--

02:47:57.863 --> 02:48:01.985
MARISHA: I'll try to look for firewood,
but I'm so exhausted.

02:48:01.985 --> 02:48:06.013
LAURA: It's going to be so hard to find
wood down here in the tunnels.

02:48:06.013 --> 02:48:08.712
LIAM: Point of clarification: are we travelling
through worm tunnel at this point?

02:48:08.712 --> 02:48:09.809
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:48:09.809 --> 02:48:11.340
LIAM: Okay. Which is how wide again, ten--?

02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:12.053
MATT: Ten feet.

02:48:12.053 --> 02:48:12.685
LIAM: Ten feet across.

02:48:12.685 --> 02:48:13.337
MATT: Always been ten feet.

02:48:13.337 --> 02:48:15.165
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, thank you.

02:48:15.165 --> 02:48:19.517
TRAVIS: I'm sitting cross-legged
on the floor, staring at the dirt.

02:48:19.517 --> 02:48:21.971
LIAM: I don't think we need to pull up
the dome right now.

02:48:21.971 --> 02:48:22.986
LAURA: Not yet, no.

02:48:22.986 --> 02:48:23.769
MARISHA: No.

02:48:23.769 --> 02:48:25.226
MATT: Okay. You guys--

02:48:25.226 --> 02:48:26.777
SAM: Am I nearing them?

02:48:26.777 --> 02:48:30.663
MATT: As you're invisible-- are you walking
back towards their direction?

02:48:30.663 --> 02:48:31.574
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:48:31.574 --> 02:48:36.415
MATT: Okay. You see the two of them, around the
bend, are both looking and the one with the spear

02:48:36.415 --> 02:48:40.249
is looking kind of eager. The one with all the
shit on it is looking a little apprehensive

02:48:40.249 --> 02:48:46.680
and they're both just watching and talking
back and forth. (kobold speech)

02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:48.514
LIAM: Is Nott out of our sight?

02:48:48.514 --> 02:48:50.510
MATT: Yeah. Nott vanished a few minutes ago.

02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:52.977
SAM: I'm going to try to sneak up
on the one with the spear.

02:48:52.977 --> 02:48:54.620
MATT: All right.

02:48:54.620 --> 02:49:01.274
SAM: And get close to he or she
and grab the spear out of their hand.

02:49:01.274 --> 02:49:06.114
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a...
I would say, with advantage,

02:49:06.114 --> 02:49:09.505
make an athletics check to try and--

02:49:13.936 --> 02:49:14.622
SAM: 20.

02:49:14.622 --> 02:49:19.796
MATT: Seven. The spear vanishes from its hand.

02:49:19.796 --> 02:49:24.270
SAM: I'll throw it the opposite direction
down the tunnel away from us.

02:49:24.270 --> 02:49:33.588
MATT: (confused kobold noises) He looks confused
and rubs his wrist and starts walking

02:49:33.588 --> 02:49:37.640
back towards the spear on the opposite side.

02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:47.099
SAM: Then while he or she is going to get their
spear, I'm going to try and grapple the weird one.

02:49:47.099 --> 02:49:50.043
The one that's all weird and shit.

02:49:50.043 --> 02:49:53.969
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

02:49:53.969 --> 02:49:55.590
SAM: Oh, not advantage.

02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:59.072
MATT: I would say advantage because it doesn't
know you're there. I'll allow it. It's fine.

02:49:59.072 --> 02:50:00.686
SAM: Okay. 19.

02:50:00.686 --> 02:50:06.418
MATT: 19. Okay. If you'd like to
describe your kobold.

02:50:06.418 --> 02:50:11.728
(yells of surprise and disbelief)

02:50:11.728 --> 02:50:15.975
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch! You slow-playing
son of a bitch.

02:50:15.975 --> 02:50:20.467
LIAM: Playing the long game. The long con!

02:50:20.467 --> 02:50:21.841
MATT: Move over, Taliesin.

02:50:21.841 --> 02:50:23.749
TALIESIN: Oh, am I moving over? Okay.

02:50:23.749 --> 02:50:26.561
(pandemonium)

02:50:26.561 --> 02:50:28.533
LIAM: Oh my god! Long con!

02:50:28.533 --> 02:50:31.998
TRAVIS: That was good.
That was some bullshit.

02:50:31.998 --> 02:50:35.337
TALIESIN: Holy shit.

02:50:35.337 --> 02:50:37.882
MATT: There we go.

02:50:37.882 --> 02:50:39.284
TALIESIN: I'm going to make some room here.

02:50:39.284 --> 02:50:39.960
MATT: Welcome, Chris.

02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:41.358
CHRIS: Thank you very much!

02:50:41.358 --> 02:50:43.910
SAM: What?! We were specifically told...

02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:46.444
TRAVIS: Not playing.

02:50:46.444 --> 02:50:48.845
ALL: Not playing!

02:50:48.845 --> 02:50:50.300
MARISHA: Just visiting!

02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:52.102
CHRIS: This is a house of lies!

02:50:52.102 --> 02:50:54.794
(laughter)

02:50:54.794 --> 02:50:56.564
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

02:50:56.564 --> 02:50:57.833
CHRIS: No peeking.

02:50:57.833 --> 02:50:59.250
TALIESIN: No peeking.

02:50:59.250 --> 02:51:05.260
MATT: So. Suddenly, out of nowhere, apparates
in the nervous energy of the moment

02:51:05.260 --> 02:51:10.335
the small goblin creature that you've
been eyeing nervously as the group

02:51:10.335 --> 02:51:14.695
wandered through, and it just reaches out
and grabs a hold of you.

02:51:14.695 --> 02:51:17.309
CHRIS: Ah! Mommy! Mommy!

02:51:17.309 --> 02:51:20.827
SAM: Yeah, I am your mommy!
Yeah! Deal with it!

02:51:22.318 --> 02:51:32.281
CHRIS: So this kobold has... he's got flasks
hanging off him by ropes and you can see

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:37.529
that these flasks are basically just
stoppered gourds and they're clattering

02:51:37.529 --> 02:51:46.832
and banging together. He's got a basket of
swarming centipedes slung over his back.

02:51:46.832 --> 02:51:47.902
SAM: Open?

02:51:47.902 --> 02:51:51.108
CHRIS: No, it's also closed off, almost
like a closed off net of centipedes.

02:51:51.108 --> 02:51:51.856
SAM: Ugh.

02:51:51.856 --> 02:51:53.223
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:51:53.223 --> 02:51:59.687
CHRIS: With a rope attached to it. And then
there is a clay pot hanging from that,

02:51:59.687 --> 02:52:08.541
that has an acrid smell rising from it and
another clay pot tied to a rope that's lashed

02:52:08.541 --> 02:52:17.916
around his shoulders. His weapon is a staff
with a living scorpion tied at the top of it.

02:52:17.916 --> 02:52:20.228
SAM: Caduceus, where are you when I need you?

02:52:20.228 --> 02:52:26.815
CHRIS: Its little tail jabbing at the air.
And the cage holds a creature

02:52:26.815 --> 02:52:30.078
that you recognise as a skunk.

02:52:31.787 --> 02:52:33.063
TRAVIS: This fucking--

02:52:33.063 --> 02:52:34.523
TALIESIN: This is chemical warfare, man.

02:52:34.523 --> 02:52:49.122
CHRIS: The worst is, tied to this stick with
the scorpion on it is a bag that is buzzing

02:52:49.122 --> 02:52:51.355
loudly like it's full of hornets.

02:52:51.355 --> 02:52:52.565
SAM: Hey, bees.

02:52:52.565 --> 02:52:54.922
LAURA: Hey, bees!

02:52:54.922 --> 02:53:00.567
MATT: So as you hear this sudden clattering
commotion, and both this kobold voice

02:53:00.567 --> 02:53:06.927
screaming out, "Mommy!" and Nott going, "Yeah,
mommy!" the other kobold down the way goes,

02:53:06.927 --> 02:53:10.178
(panicked kobold yelling) and runs off to grab
the spear, you guys hear this noise.

02:53:10.178 --> 02:53:11.577
What are you two doing?

02:53:11.577 --> 02:53:14.208
SAM: I'm going to-- Oh, you two
meaning me and Chris?

02:53:14.208 --> 02:53:15.922
MATT: Yeah. What's your reaction.

02:53:15.922 --> 02:53:19.185
CHRIS: I am trying to take my stick
and hit him with the scorpion.

02:53:19.185 --> 02:53:22.187
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack.

02:53:22.187 --> 02:53:24.901
TRAVIS: Little scorpion on the end of the stick?

02:53:24.901 --> 02:53:27.100
CHRIS: Little scorpion.

02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:29.099
TRAVIS: Please hit.

02:53:29.099 --> 02:53:30.820
CHRIS: That is a-- What is that?

02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.223
TALIESIN: That, I believe, is in fact a--

02:53:32.223 --> 02:53:32.999
LAURA: A natural 20?

02:53:32.999 --> 02:53:34.295
TALIESIN: I think that's a natural 20.

02:53:34.295 --> 02:53:38.472
(laughter)

02:53:38.472 --> 02:53:44.967
TALIESIN: Yeah, that is! That's your old Keyleth
die, too. I've never seen it roll one in my life.

02:53:44.967 --> 02:53:47.633
CHRIS: So it stings you on your eyelid. (Pfff!)

02:53:47.633 --> 02:53:48.824
SAM: Ah!

02:53:48.824 --> 02:53:52.222
TRAVIS: Yeah, best place.

02:53:52.222 --> 02:53:56.647
CHRIS: You take one piercing damage and
have to make a constitution saving throw.

02:53:56.647 --> 02:53:58.770
MATT: So two piercing damage with the crit.

02:53:58.770 --> 02:54:00.616
CHRIS: Oh. Sure, I like it. Yeah; two.

02:54:00.616 --> 02:54:01.933
SAM: Con save? 21.

02:54:01.933 --> 02:54:07.926
CHRIS: Okay. You succeed and take half
of this amount of damage. Which is...

02:54:07.926 --> 02:54:10.231
LIAM: 79.

02:54:10.231 --> 02:54:12.968
MATT: Technically, the dice damage is doubled
because it's a crit too. So it's just straight damage.

02:54:12.968 --> 02:54:17.562
CHRIS: Oh, right yeah! Double poison damage, shit.
So that will be seven points of poison damage on you.

02:54:17.562 --> 02:54:24.682
MATT: The eye immediately swells up from
the impact and you're like, "Ah!"

02:54:24.682 --> 02:54:29.279
Just spinning around in a circle. The one
with the spear rushes up like, "Ergh!"

02:54:29.279 --> 02:54:31.845
Can't quite figure out where to go.
What are you guys doing?

02:54:31.845 --> 02:54:32.966
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up.

02:54:32.966 --> 02:54:34.256
LIAM: Walking towards the noise, <i>ja</i>.

02:54:34.256 --> 02:54:36.230
SAM: I've got one!

02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:43.473
MATT: You rush around the corner and you see this
whirling whirlwind of clattering pots and cage and

02:54:43.473 --> 02:54:48.474
goblin and kobold screaming. Anyone doing
anything or are you just watching?

02:54:48.474 --> 02:54:50.570
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command.

02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:51.937
MATT: All right.

02:54:51.937 --> 02:55:02.697
LAURA: At second le-- no. Yeah, second level.
And try to get both of them and say, Stop it!

02:55:02.697 --> 02:55:04.663
SAM: You're commanding me too?

02:55:04.663 --> 02:55:07.121
LAURA: No, both of the...

02:55:07.121 --> 02:55:08.706
MATT: Gotcha.

02:55:08.706 --> 02:55:13.601
LIAM: The second one ran off down the hall a bit.

02:55:13.601 --> 02:55:15.409
LAURA: Yeah, but it's still within range.

02:55:15.409 --> 02:55:16.828
MATT: All right. So it's wisdom saving throws?

02:55:16.828 --> 02:55:18.102
LAURA: Yes, wisdom saving throw.

02:55:18.102 --> 02:55:20.087
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw,
if you don't mind.

02:55:20.087 --> 02:55:23.728
LIAM: And simultaneously, I am casting
Enlarge on Nott the Brave.

02:55:23.728 --> 02:55:28.683
MATT: Okay. So--

02:55:28.683 --> 02:55:31.191
CHRIS: I rolled a 14 minus two is 12.

02:55:31.191 --> 02:55:34.461
MATT: 12. 17 minus two which is 15.

02:55:34.461 --> 02:55:36.305
LAURA: They both have to stop it!

02:55:36.305 --> 02:55:40.134
MATT: So immediately, the one holding the
spear looks at you, "Huh!" And you find yourself

02:55:40.134 --> 02:55:44.576
all of a sudden stop struggling and weapon
freezes in place. At the same time, the tiny

02:55:44.576 --> 02:55:49.564
goblin arms around you suddenly Hulk out
and you find yourself lifted off the ground,

02:55:49.564 --> 02:55:53.409
your legs dangling a few inches off
the floor of the cavern.

02:55:53.409 --> 02:55:56.583
SAM: Don't make mommy (much deeper) mad!

02:55:56.583 --> 02:55:59.988
(laughter)

02:55:59.988 --> 02:56:04.386
TALIESIN: Aww, come on.

02:56:04.386 --> 02:56:06.487
LAURA: I mean...

02:56:06.487 --> 02:56:09.115
SAM: Who are you?
(deeper) What do you want?

02:56:09.115 --> 02:56:10.942
CHRIS: I'm Spurt!

02:56:10.942 --> 02:56:12.897
TRAVIS, MARISHA, SAM: Spurt?!

02:56:12.897 --> 02:56:14.468
MATT: "I'm Bex."

02:56:14.468 --> 02:56:16.444
LAURA: Spurt and Bex?

02:56:16.444 --> 02:56:18.855
MATT: "Yeah."

02:56:18.855 --> 02:56:22.821
CHRIS: We're supposed to follow you
to make sure you don't drop any food!

02:56:22.821 --> 02:56:28.399
LAURA: Oh. We don't have any food.
We already gave you all the food.

02:56:28.399 --> 02:56:31.679
MATT: "Oh! (sigh)"

02:56:31.679 --> 02:56:36.084
CHRIS: Also, I'm supposed to stick a bunch of rock
grubs in your mouth while you're sleeping!

02:56:36.084 --> 02:56:38.386
SAM: What? Stick a bunch of what?

02:56:38.386 --> 02:56:40.440
MATT: "Don't have to tell them this."

02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:41.942
CHRIS: He's really big!

02:56:41.942 --> 02:56:46.894
MATT: "Okay. Sorry!"

02:56:46.894 --> 02:56:50.313
LAURA: You guys, what the fuck are you doing?

02:56:50.313 --> 02:56:52.178
TALIESIN: I mean, I just feel bad, really,
at this point.

02:56:52.178 --> 02:56:56.795
LAURA: You're so cute and stuff but like,
don't attack us; we're really big.

02:56:56.795 --> 02:56:58.786
TRAVIS: Jester, you killing them or what?

02:56:58.786 --> 02:57:00.416
LAURA: Yeah, no I'm going to kill them.

02:57:00.416 --> 02:57:02.442
MATT: (scared kobold noises)

02:57:02.442 --> 02:57:04.081
LAURA: (whispered) I'm not going
to kill you, don't worry.

02:57:04.081 --> 02:57:04.643
SAM: Run.

02:57:04.643 --> 02:57:07.107
CHRIS: If you let us go, I'll let you
play with our centipault.

02:57:07.107 --> 02:57:08.478
LAURA: What's a centipault?

02:57:08.478 --> 02:57:10.325
MARISHA: I'm interested.

02:57:10.325 --> 02:57:13.001
TRAVIS: You don't want to play with that.

02:57:13.001 --> 02:57:15.457
TALIESIN: No, I feel like we should
hear this out.

02:57:15.562 --> 02:57:17.735
SAM: Your centipault?

02:57:17.735 --> 02:57:20.009
CHRIS: Yeah. It's an invention.

02:57:20.009 --> 02:57:22.704
SAM: What does it do?

02:57:23.452 --> 02:57:25.666
CHRIS: It throws centipedes real far.

02:57:25.666 --> 02:57:27.599
LAURA: That's awesome!

02:57:28.023 --> 02:57:33.635
LIAM: Show us a demonstration and we will
induct you to the Mighty Nein.

02:57:33.828 --> 02:57:35.819
CHRIS: Tell mommy to let me go.

02:57:35.819 --> 02:57:38.106
TALIESIN: Um... well...

02:57:38.106 --> 02:57:39.468
SAM: All right.

02:57:39.468 --> 02:57:40.482
TALIESIN: Mommy?

02:57:41.492 --> 02:57:43.622
SAM: Show us the centipault.

02:57:44.703 --> 02:57:48.051
LAURA: But not on us.
Don't attack us, okay?

02:57:48.462 --> 02:57:50.621
MATT: There's only one other target
in the chamber.

02:57:50.621 --> 02:57:55.361
CHRIS: All right. Yes, exactly. So I will take off
my green slime pot, and I will take off my rock

02:57:55.361 --> 02:58:00.393
grub pot, and I'll lay down my scorpion stick, and
my skunk in a cage, and my wasp in a bag.

02:58:01.734 --> 02:58:03.614
TALIESIN: I like it.

02:58:03.788 --> 02:58:08.312
CHRIS: And then I will begin assembling my
centipault out of other oddities that I have on me.

02:58:08.312 --> 02:58:12.395
LAURA: I'm going to open my sketchbook
and draw all of it.

02:58:12.395 --> 02:58:14.852
MATT: Learning the cutting-edge
kobold technology.

02:58:14.852 --> 02:58:18.941
SAM: Maybe we should set up some sort of
target for the young man.

02:58:18.941 --> 02:58:21.155
CHRIS: I'll use him.

02:58:21.155 --> 02:58:22.407
TRAVIS: What'd he say?

02:58:22.407 --> 02:58:25.070
SAM: He's going to shoot centipedes at you.

02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:27.101
LAURA: Don't worry, we'll heal you.

02:58:27.203 --> 02:58:29.414
TRAVIS: Sounded like there's something that
shoots centipedes on me.

02:58:29.414 --> 02:58:30.592
MARISHA: No, that's exactly what he said.

02:58:30.592 --> 02:58:32.850
CHRIS: Then you hear this sound: (pthwoing).

02:58:32.850 --> 02:58:35.336
MARISHA: Do you have bug allergies? Oh, no.

02:58:35.336 --> 02:58:41.152
TRAVIS: (panicked screaming)

02:58:41.736 --> 02:58:42.994
MARISHA: Have you been stung?

02:58:42.994 --> 02:58:45.122
LIAM: Leeches!

02:58:45.495 --> 02:58:47.361
MATT: Fjord just comes running down the hallway.

02:58:47.361 --> 02:58:49.077
TRAVIS: (screaming)

02:58:49.077 --> 02:58:52.387
MATT: The kobold in right in front of you goes,
"Ah!" Just screams at you as you slam into it.

02:58:52.387 --> 02:58:54.630
The spear goes clattering to the ground.

02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:56.078
TALIESIN: That's really neat.

02:58:56.078 --> 02:58:58.140
LAURA: That's really cool.

02:58:58.140 --> 02:59:00.925
MARISHA: It works! It's amazing.

02:59:00.925 --> 02:59:02.168
TALIESIN: Aw man.

02:59:02.168 --> 02:59:04.124
SAM: That's ingenious.

02:59:04.124 --> 02:59:07.433
MATT: At which point, the Enlarge spell fades.
(whoosh)

02:59:08.294 --> 02:59:11.139
TRAVIS: That was fucking terrible.

02:59:11.139 --> 02:59:15.045
CHRIS: Want to see my skunk?
I hold it up by the tail.

02:59:15.045 --> 02:59:17.224
TRAVIS: Oh, no!

02:59:17.224 --> 02:59:18.227
LAURA: Is it alive?

02:59:18.227 --> 02:59:19.348
CHRIS: Oh, yeah.

02:59:19.348 --> 02:59:21.075
TALIESIN: Hey, hi. How's it going?

02:59:21.075 --> 02:59:26.730
MATT: As he holds up the skunk, the nervous energy
around it, the skunk just instinctually-- (snarl)

02:59:26.730 --> 02:59:27.576
LAURA: No!

02:59:27.576 --> 02:59:28.575
MATT: (spray)

02:59:28.575 --> 02:59:30.317
TRAVIS, MARISHA: (groans)

02:59:30.317 --> 02:59:32.183
MATT: Dexterity saving throw for Jester and Nott.

02:59:32.708 --> 02:59:34.082
LAURA: Ugh!

02:59:35.462 --> 02:59:36.555
TALIESIN: Great!

02:59:36.555 --> 02:59:37.346
LIAM: Come on.

02:59:37.346 --> 02:59:38.454
MARISHA: Dodge those juices.

02:59:38.454 --> 02:59:39.177
LIAM: No.

02:59:39.177 --> 02:59:40.097
SAM: 18.

02:59:40.097 --> 02:59:40.994
LAURA: 15.

02:59:40.994 --> 02:59:42.026
LIAM: Damn it!

02:59:42.026 --> 02:59:45.494
MATT: All right. You manage to just barely
escape out of the way as it--

02:59:45.848 --> 02:59:47.497
CHRIS: No! Bad, Pepé! Bad!

02:59:47.497 --> 02:59:49.067
(laughter)

02:59:49.067 --> 02:59:51.135
MATT: (skunk noises)

02:59:51.135 --> 02:59:52.881
CHRIS: I beat it with my stick.

02:59:52.881 --> 02:59:54.069
MATT: Okay.

02:59:54.069 --> 02:59:58.290
LAURA: No, don't beat it! Poor Pepé.

02:59:58.674 --> 03:00:05.216
MATT: The other kobold has fled. It saw the
running Fjord centipede nightmare and just left.

03:00:05.587 --> 03:00:11.010
TRAVIS: As fun as that was, you know,
instead of killing this adorable little guy,

03:00:11.010 --> 03:00:15.896
maybe we could enlist him as a scout or guide?

03:00:16.138 --> 03:00:21.525
SAM: Do you know these tunnels at all? Have you
explored since the worm came through?

03:00:21.525 --> 03:00:22.958
CHRIS: Yeah!

03:00:23.489 --> 03:00:26.224
SAM: What was that? What did you just do?

03:00:26.224 --> 03:00:28.260
MATT: Still hitting the skunk.

03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:31.537
TRAVIS: Stop! No, hey, hey!

03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:33.478
LAURA: Stop hitting it.

03:00:33.478 --> 03:00:35.783
SAM: Don't beat your skunk.

03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:37.589
CHRIS: I put it back in its box.

03:00:37.589 --> 03:00:41.228
LIAM: Yeah, I have a question for you,
my little friend. Do you eat enough

03:00:41.228 --> 03:00:43.894
under your current leadership?

03:00:45.244 --> 03:00:46.445
CHRIS: No!

03:00:46.643 --> 03:00:54.152
LIAM: We will keep your belly full. If you travel
with us, you will have never eaten so much

03:00:54.152 --> 03:01:00.639
in your life. But we do need a guide
down here, and you could be that guide.

03:01:02.231 --> 03:01:08.830
CHRIS: (shouting) I'm very quiet! Tie off
the cage, sling it over my hornets,

03:01:08.830 --> 03:01:12.583
tie them back to my staff.

03:01:12.583 --> 03:01:16.650
TALIESIN: If it gets us to where we need to be,
I'd be willing to drop another spell.

03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:19.518
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:20.505 --> 03:01:27.030
TALIESIN: Another 45 pounds, whatever we don't
need of that 45 pounds, which is an awful lot of food.

03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:31.812
TRAVIS: I think you'll have no trouble finding
your way back. How far down this tunnel

03:01:31.812 --> 03:01:35.850
have you ventured before, Spurt?

03:01:36.178 --> 03:01:39.013
CHRIS: I point back the way we came
about 60 feet.

03:01:39.013 --> 03:01:42.705
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Brave new world.

03:01:42.705 --> 03:01:45.820
LIAM: Oh. That is less appealing.

03:01:46.206 --> 03:01:51.217
SAM: But you're quiet and you can stealth, right?
You snuck up on us very well.

03:01:51.217 --> 03:01:53.948
TALIESIN: Is that a bag of bees you've got
over there?

03:01:53.948 --> 03:01:55.675
LAURA: Oh hello, bees!

03:01:55.675 --> 03:01:58.186
CHRIS: I've got plus zero, is that high?

03:01:58.645 --> 03:01:59.857
SAM: Sure.

03:02:00.197 --> 03:02:01.769
CHRIS: Here are my bees.

03:02:02.449 --> 03:02:04.207
TALIESIN and LAURA: Hi, bees.

03:02:04.841 --> 03:02:07.544
LIAM: Not the bees. Not the bees.

03:02:07.544 --> 03:02:11.271
LAURA: Hey Spurt, how long have you lived down
here?

03:02:11.271 --> 03:02:13.446
CHRIS: 11 days!

03:02:13.446 --> 03:02:14.799
LAURA: 11 days?

03:02:14.799 --> 03:02:16.591
SAM: How long do kobolds live?

03:02:16.591 --> 03:02:18.006
CHRIS: 11 days!

03:02:18.006 --> 03:02:19.787
(laughter)

03:02:19.787 --> 03:02:22.074
TRAVIS: Oh god, this is it! The swan song!

03:02:22.214 --> 03:02:26.796
LIAM: And in your 11 days, what is the worst thing
you have ever seen down here?

03:02:27.928 --> 03:02:30.954
CHRIS: My brother got eaten by a green slime.

03:02:30.954 --> 03:02:34.011
MARISHA: Wait, like the green slime you have
right there in the--

03:02:34.011 --> 03:02:35.255
CHRIS: Yeah, that's the one!

03:02:35.255 --> 03:02:36.337
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

03:02:36.337 --> 03:02:38.636
(laughter)

03:02:41.785 --> 03:02:43.334
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:02:45.340 --> 03:02:49.616
SAM: Do you like it down here?
Do you want to come with us?

03:02:49.616 --> 03:02:51.148
CHRIS: Where else is there?

03:02:51.148 --> 03:02:52.329
SAM: There's other places.

03:02:52.329 --> 03:02:53.695
CHRIS: Really?

03:02:53.695 --> 03:02:59.388
SAM: Yes. There's light and other terrain.

03:02:59.388 --> 03:03:03.039
MARISHA: Would you like to follow us towards
the light at the end of the tunnel?

03:03:04.983 --> 03:03:06.876
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

03:03:06.876 --> 03:03:08.449
CHRIS: Okay!

03:03:08.449 --> 03:03:11.174
LAURA: Except we're leading him to
a really scary place, y'all.

03:03:11.174 --> 03:03:15.969
SAM: We don't know that. We don't know,
Xhorhas might love kobolds.

03:03:19.789 --> 03:03:24.501
LIAM: Plus he's near the end of his life.
We might as well show him great things,

03:03:24.525 --> 03:03:30.502
going to eat better than he ever has.
We could let him look at the dodecahedron.

03:03:30.502 --> 03:03:34.023
LAURA: We shouldn't pull that shit out.

03:03:34.023 --> 03:03:38.589
LIAM: Or leave it in the bag. I'm just
kidding, forget it. That's a bad idea.

03:03:38.589 --> 03:03:40.666
LAURA: That could be a really bad idea, Caleb.

03:03:40.666 --> 03:03:42.569
LIAM: It's funny, but it's not wise.

03:03:42.569 --> 03:03:44.130
TRAVIS: We should keep going.

03:03:44.130 --> 03:03:45.969
LAURA: Yeah. You want to come with us?

03:03:45.969 --> 03:03:47.275
CHRIS: Yeah!

03:03:47.275 --> 03:03:51.362
LAURA: Hey, this kid thinks you're his mom.

03:03:53.262 --> 03:03:56.313
SAM: That's super duper sad right now.

03:03:57.584 --> 03:03:59.837
TALIESIN: Way to bring the whole room down.

03:04:00.939 --> 03:04:03.709
MARISHA: I'm dying. I am dying.

03:04:06.122 --> 03:04:09.490
LIAM: D&amp;D, happiness and sadness tied together.

03:04:09.649 --> 03:04:12.646
MATT: (laughing) All right, so
what's the marching order?

03:04:12.992 --> 03:04:14.971
SAM: Spurt 30 feet ahead?

03:04:14.971 --> 03:04:16.963
MATT: All right.

03:04:18.444 --> 03:04:21.848
CHRIS: I walk with my staff out so
Stingy is actually in the lead.

03:04:21.848 --> 03:04:29.194
MATT: Got you, so you're leading with your
scorpion, perfect. Spurt continues forward.

03:04:29.194 --> 03:04:30.552
Do you guys follow?

03:04:30.552 --> 03:04:31.816
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:04:31.816 --> 03:04:38.190
MATT: All right. Spurt, roll a
perception check for me.

03:04:38.395 --> 03:04:41.324
CHRIS: Something around here's stinky!

03:04:41.569 --> 03:04:44.100
LIAM: This is the best. This is the best!

03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:45.943
TALIESIN: Wow!

03:04:47.549 --> 03:04:49.791
MATT: (laughing) Okay!

03:04:50.170 --> 03:04:52.829
CHRIS: Hey, it's dark down here!

03:04:56.497 --> 03:04:58.767
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is going to be great.

03:04:58.767 --> 03:05:05.624
TRAVIS: (laughing) "It's dark down here."
Not good, not good.

03:05:05.624 --> 03:05:12.658
MATT: Continuing on for the next few hours,
getting slowly used to the smell of kobold--

03:05:12.658 --> 03:05:20.078
especially a moving-hoarder of a kobold-- the
tunnel continues to curve and it goes down a

03:05:20.078 --> 03:05:26.328
little further, then it evens out and goes down a
little further, then evens out. You get pretty

03:05:26.328 --> 03:05:35.639
late into the day before you begin to notice the
rock and stone having some slight changes.

03:05:35.639 --> 03:05:43.348
The general bits of materials that you've been
used to seeing down here-- the heavy gray and

03:05:43.348 --> 03:05:49.708
brown rocks-- occasionally, you see flecks and
glimmers that your passing light puts

03:05:49.708 --> 03:05:55.996
a shine across. You go over and inspect it
and it is a black, glass-like substance.

03:05:57.659 --> 03:05:59.108
MARISHA: Is it obsidian?

03:05:59.108 --> 03:06:04.716
MATT: It's obsidian. You continue moving forward
and there's more sections of it, and you can see

03:06:04.716 --> 03:06:09.583
where bits of it are broken and flaked off where
the worm was burrowing through and battered

03:06:09.583 --> 03:06:13.084
through a section of obsidian
that then shattered.

03:06:13.084 --> 03:06:15.216
TALIESIN: If there's any way to scoop up
a couple of pieces.

03:06:15.216 --> 03:06:17.957
MATT: Yeah, definitely. You gather up a bunch
of obsidian shards. A lot of it is broken and

03:06:17.957 --> 03:06:23.375
brittle, but there are some larger bits that you
can find that are pretty jagged, really. You see

03:06:23.375 --> 03:06:25.976
them first, so you gather what you want.

03:06:25.976 --> 03:06:28.603
CHRIS: Oh, I'm too busy eating the poop
out of my skunk's cage.

03:06:28.603 --> 03:06:30.151
MATT: There you go.

03:06:30.151 --> 03:06:31.822
MARISHA: Goodberries!

03:06:31.822 --> 03:06:35.044
MATT: Hey, guys, kobolds have ecology down.

03:06:36.964 --> 03:06:39.018
CHRIS: Nothing goes to waste!

03:06:39.803 --> 03:06:42.058
LIAM: It's like a Dune suit, man, you can't let
that shit go to waste.

03:06:42.058 --> 03:06:43.098
MATT: Exactly!

03:06:43.721 --> 03:06:45.632
LIAM: Reduce, reuse, recycle!

03:06:45.971 --> 03:06:47.864
MARISHA: Stop, I just got better.

03:06:48.109 --> 03:06:54.341
MATT: I'm just saying, none of you has a weapon
that feeds you. The air gets steadily warmer and

03:06:54.341 --> 03:07:04.635
warmer as the hours pass, and the floor itself
begins to give way from the softer dirt and dust

03:07:04.635 --> 03:07:11.513
with loose pebbles to become a harder, more porous
rock, and the obsidian begins to become more

03:07:11.513 --> 03:07:21.781
apparent and more consistent. You, Spurt, begin to
see a dull light ahead. A dull, low, red light.

03:07:21.781 --> 03:07:23.371
CHRIS: Perception zero.

03:07:23.371 --> 03:07:24.830
MATT and SAM: Yeah.

03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:29.919
CHRIS: Light! I see the light! I run toward it.

03:07:30.809 --> 03:07:32.844
LAURA: Can we see what it is?

03:07:33.486 --> 03:07:39.855
MATT: It looks to be the tunnel coming to an end
for some sort of chamber. You're too far away to

03:07:39.855 --> 03:07:45.851
make out any details, but it looks like there is a
room beyond it that has a dull, red glow to it.

03:07:45.851 --> 03:07:48.076
LAURA: Oh no, Spurt, don't run!

03:07:48.584 --> 03:07:50.476
MATT: You just run out?

03:07:50.476 --> 03:07:51.449
CHRIS: Yes.

03:07:51.449 --> 03:08:01.687
MATT: You guys see Spurt run out. The temperature
here is getting warmer and warmer as you progress.

03:08:01.687 --> 03:08:08.277
You're starting to find yourselves sweat
uncomfortably. You rush out into an open field of

03:08:08.277 --> 03:08:16.189
rock, like hewn, carved rock floor-- like a
courtyard, if you will. It's about a hundred feet

03:08:16.189 --> 03:08:24.262
or so across at first glance. Across the way,
there is a wall, or portions of a stone wall built

03:08:24.262 --> 03:08:31.136
into parts of an obsidian and stone cliff face or
the interior of a cavern. You look on the inside,

03:08:31.136 --> 03:08:36.719
and in this brief instant, you take in the
vicinity, through your kobold eyes, this large

03:08:36.719 --> 03:08:46.377
chamber that continues on far to your left. To the
right is, at a very steep incline, an obsidian

03:08:46.377 --> 03:08:54.562
wall, where a pouring river of molten magma is
coming down into a trough that goes across this

03:08:54.562 --> 03:09:01.594
open chamber-- this river of lava with a bridge
that goes across it to the opposite side. To the

03:09:01.594 --> 03:09:13.297
left, there is a very interesting, massive black
iron citadel that sits maybe a quarter mile to

03:09:13.297 --> 03:09:21.136
the left of you. At the peak of it-- and this is a
very large chamber-- dozens of thick, heavy black

03:09:21.136 --> 03:09:30.727
chains affixed to its peak drape off and connect
to the odd corners of this large cavern. This is

03:09:30.727 --> 03:09:36.608
far to your left; you're in a small side courtyard
on this side. As you stop and look around--

03:09:41.580 --> 03:09:51.975
(laughs) hilariously unnoticed by the two massive
fire giants that are currently playing sentinel.

03:09:51.975 --> 03:09:56.993
There's one across the way, leaning against the
wall, standing at roughly 18 to 20 feet tall, dark

03:09:56.993 --> 03:10:01.894
gray skin. What little bit of red hair you see
peeking from underneath its armored helmet as

03:10:01.894 --> 03:10:09.035
it's wearing heavy, dark armor covered in spikes,
metallic thorns. One hand is holding a tower

03:10:09.035 --> 03:10:14.809
shield, roughly its full height, also covered in
spikes in the front, with another shield just like

03:10:14.809 --> 03:10:20.129
that that's leaning on the wall. It looks like
it's currently spacing out for a moment, looking

03:10:20.129 --> 03:10:26.329
back towards the citadel. To the immediate left of
you, on this side of that molten river, you see a

03:10:26.329 --> 03:10:31.218
female fire giant, wielding a giant maul, who is
in the process of picking her teeth with some sort

03:10:31.218 --> 03:10:37.254
of pointed bone, and neither have noticed you,
strangely. They rolled really shitty.

03:10:38.421 --> 03:10:41.081
LIAM: You said citadel. We are seeing
a fortress down here?

03:10:41.081 --> 03:10:43.842
MATT: You guys aren't seeing this.
You just see the kobold rush out.

03:10:43.842 --> 03:10:45.664
LIAM: Okay.

03:10:45.986 --> 03:10:49.120
MATT: So what do you do, Spurt?

03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:52.366
CHRIS: How far away is the closest one to me?

03:10:52.366 --> 03:10:55.930
MATT: The closest one to you is about
20 feet to your left.

03:10:55.930 --> 03:10:58.547
CHRIS: I throw my wasp nest in a bag at it.

03:10:58.547 --> 03:10:59.432
MATT: Okay!

03:10:59.432 --> 03:11:00.918
TRAVIS: Yes!

03:11:04.057 --> 03:11:06.345
MATT: Roll for attack on it-- or is it a saving
throw on their part?

03:11:06.345 --> 03:11:13.276
CHRIS: I throw the bag into a five-foot square
within 20 feet of me and it bursts open

03:11:13.276 --> 03:11:17.118
into a swarm of wasps with 11 hit points.

03:11:17.118 --> 03:11:32.384
MATT: Spurt runs out, turns, and, "Ah!" (impact,
buzzing). The giant goes (grunts) and slaps--

03:11:32.384 --> 03:11:35.128
CHRIS: You dead! You dead!

03:11:36.423 --> 03:11:38.100
LAURA: I love him!

03:11:38.100 --> 03:11:39.696
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:11:40.486 --> 03:11:42.775
TRAVIS: Please have some real armor!

03:11:43.157 --> 03:11:44.887
MATT: 22 to hit against you.

03:11:44.887 --> 03:11:46.828
CHRIS: (laughs) Okay.

03:11:49.063 --> 03:11:50.505
MATT: You take...

03:11:51.985 --> 03:11:54.145
TRAVIS: Remember that number, kids.

03:11:55.446 --> 03:11:57.663
28 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:11:57.663 --> 03:11:59.020
CHRIS: I win! (splats)

03:12:00.723 --> 03:12:04.458
MATT: You watch as Spurt turns after throwing
this, and then a giant hammer (slamming,

03:12:04.458 --> 03:12:09.933
squishing) Gallaghers Spurt across the stone floor
of this open way.

03:12:13.003 --> 03:12:14.970
LAURA and SAM: No!

03:12:15.954 --> 03:12:20.465
TRAVIS: I run to the side of the cavern wall and
lean up against it and shrink down.

03:12:20.465 --> 03:12:23.276
CHRIS: A little green slime seeps out underneath
the hammer.

03:12:23.276 --> 03:12:28.698
MATT: The hammer lifts up and you see the stringy
mess that was once Spurt detaching from the hammer.

03:12:28.824 --> 03:12:31.650
SAM: My boy! He was my boy!

03:12:31.650 --> 03:12:33.623
TRAVIS: Shh! Shh!

03:12:36.286 --> 03:12:37.840
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check here.

03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:40.091
LIAM: Caleb starts walking slowly back through the
entire walking formation.

03:12:40.091 --> 03:12:41.836
MATT: Your work is done here.

03:12:41.836 --> 03:12:45.258
(cheering, laughter)

03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:47.385
TRAVIS: Holy fuck!

03:12:47.385 --> 03:12:49.825
SAM: He died as he lived, as a spurt.

03:12:50.875 --> 03:12:52.945
MATT: Thank you, Chris.

03:12:54.725 --> 03:12:56.006
LAURA: What are we rolling, stealth?

03:12:56.006 --> 03:12:57.427
MATT: Stealth check.

03:12:57.427 --> 03:12:59.417
MARISHA: We fulfilled our end of the bargain.
I feel okay.

03:12:59.417 --> 03:13:00.417
TALIESIN: That happened.

03:13:00.417 --> 03:13:02.606
LIAM: That spurt was quick, but potent.

03:13:03.166 --> 03:13:05.520
MATT: No, Pass Without a Trace was not cast.

03:13:06.487 --> 03:13:08.005
MARISHA: We're stealthing?

03:13:09.648 --> 03:13:11.173
Natural 20!

03:13:11.173 --> 03:13:12.780
TALIESIN: (singing) Natural 20!

03:13:12.780 --> 03:13:15.920
LIAM: Well, fuck y'all, because I rolled a two.

03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:18.734
SAM: 23.

03:13:18.734 --> 03:13:20.878
LIAM: That's a four for me.

03:13:20.878 --> 03:13:24.248
TRAVIS: 23, natural 20, 19, and Yasha rolled an
11.

03:13:24.248 --> 03:13:25.918
LAURA: I rolled an 11.

03:13:25.918 --> 03:13:27.624
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:13:27.624 --> 03:13:29.812
MATT: Oh, wow. Okay.

03:13:29.812 --> 03:13:32.286
LAURA: Should I be rolling stealth checks
for Nugget?

03:13:32.286 --> 03:13:33.460
SAM: Is that Dani?

03:13:33.499 --> 03:13:35.958
TALIESIN: I just heard Dani break
in the other room.

03:13:35.958 --> 03:13:38.980
LIAM: There's a delayed reaction
out in the lobby!

03:13:38.980 --> 03:13:40.976
TALIESIN: The delay is the best.

03:13:41.690 --> 03:13:46.459
TRAVIS: Is that the quickest we've ever
had a player character come in and die?

03:13:46.459 --> 03:13:48.786
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:13:49.866 --> 03:13:56.864
MATT: As you guys all pull to the sides, you hear
(heavy stomping). A hand reaches down and rubs it

03:13:56.864 --> 03:14:02.879
through the smear that was once the kobold and
rises up. A couple of pieces (plopping) into the

03:14:02.879 --> 03:14:10.874
stonework, then the light goes dark as the giant's
head bends down and one giant eye peeks

03:14:10.874 --> 03:14:13.435
through the tunnel in your direction.

03:14:13.435 --> 03:14:16.505
TALIESIN: Is it on its way down into the tunnel?
How big is this tunnel, again?

03:14:16.505 --> 03:14:22.106
MATT: The tunnel is ten feet wide. The giant is
going to have a hard time. It could probably get

03:14:22.106 --> 03:14:28.381
in there if it crawled. Right now, it's leaning
down and looking inside.

03:14:28.759 --> 03:14:30.021
TALIESIN: Lights are dimmed.

03:14:30.021 --> 03:14:32.065
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're pressed flush.

03:14:32.065 --> 03:14:37.407
MATT: It glances around inside, bends its
head inside-- and it's completely engulfing

03:14:37.407 --> 03:14:38.789
the entire exit.

03:14:42.431 --> 03:14:46.312
(grunts) Backs out of
the tunnel and then steps to the side.

03:14:46.312 --> 03:14:50.441
You guys just barely fucking made that.

03:14:50.441 --> 03:14:53.229
TRAVIS: Thank you, two natural 20s.

03:14:53.562 --> 03:14:55.899
MATT: You hear it shout something in Giant.
Any of you guys speak Giant?

03:14:56.869 --> 03:14:58.113
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:14:58.297 --> 03:14:59.958
MATT: You do, that's right!

03:14:59.958 --> 03:15:02.145
SAM: Because he's a what?!

03:15:02.145 --> 03:15:06.868
MATT: Because of his background, his race.

03:15:06.868 --> 03:15:08.945
LIAM: Because he's so awesome!

03:15:08.945 --> 03:15:12.160
MATT: It's not a secret! It's actually one
of the languages that you get as a--

03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:13.342
SAM: It's secrets.

03:15:13.342 --> 03:15:14.272
MATT: Sure enough.

03:15:14.820 --> 03:15:17.295
TALIESIN: I was once a giant, there we go.
Carry on.

03:15:17.295 --> 03:15:26.600
MATT: There you go. What you hear is: (speaking
Giant). You recognize it as, "Be careful. Looks

03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:33.021
like we got rodents." You guys hear, on the
opposite side, the one that was laying with the

03:15:33.021 --> 03:15:41.112
shield sits up for a second and takes the shield,
walks over to the river of lava, scoops up some of

03:15:41.112 --> 03:15:46.616
it and pours it across the top of the shield. It's
like a pachinko machine; the lava fills the front

03:15:46.616 --> 03:15:50.558
of it, on the inside there's a pocket, and where
once there was just dark iron shield, now is

03:15:50.558 --> 03:15:57.098
heating up and the shields have a fiery exterior
to them. After it fills both the shields, it holds

03:15:57.098 --> 03:16:02.622
both of them, gets back to its position,
and they're both looking around.

03:16:02.996 --> 03:16:05.413
LIAM: Does Caduceus see that, or everybody?

03:16:05.413 --> 03:16:09.322
MATT: You guys, who are off to the side,
can glance over and watch this happen.

03:16:09.322 --> 03:16:13.193
It's across the way. You have no idea what the other
giant's doing, but this one is across the way

03:16:13.193 --> 03:16:15.251
and is visible from your position.

03:16:16.031 --> 03:16:18.542
TALIESIN: They think there are
more kobolds coming.

03:16:18.542 --> 03:16:20.871
LAURA: How are we going to get out of here?

03:16:20.871 --> 03:16:23.441
MARISHA: And where are we?

03:16:24.057 --> 03:16:32.882
SAM: Do we see into the chamber, across on the
other side? It's not a chamber; it's huge, right?

03:16:32.882 --> 03:16:38.012
MATT: It looks, you would guess, probably a
hundred or more feet across to the other side,

03:16:38.012 --> 03:16:40.658
but there is a wall there.
Make a perception check.

03:16:41.575 --> 03:16:43.480
SAM: I'm terrible at this. Five.

03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:45.138
MATT: It's hard to see from this distance.

03:16:45.138 --> 03:16:48.401
TRAVIS: Caleb, you ever read about
anything like this?

03:16:48.401 --> 03:16:55.072
LIAM: Have I ever read-- I've read a lot--
about fire giants under the earth? Yes.

03:16:55.072 --> 03:16:57.696
TRAVIS: Yeah, crazy, dark-- oh, you have?

03:16:57.696 --> 03:17:00.898
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, my grandmother used to keep me up
late at night, reading me stories about

03:17:00.898 --> 03:17:03.521
things like this. No, I don't know anything!
I don't know!

03:17:03.521 --> 03:17:07.230
TRAVIS: No dark citadels? I mean,
this is an accident, right?

03:17:07.230 --> 03:17:09.584
This isn't where we're trying to go.

03:17:09.584 --> 03:17:13.598
LIAM: I know about the history of the country I
grew up in, not about underground fortresses.

03:17:13.598 --> 03:17:17.971
LAURA: Ooh, you know what we should do?
We should mark this on the map.

03:17:17.971 --> 03:17:20.456
LIAM: Let's put a pin in that and get back to it.

03:17:20.456 --> 03:17:22.178
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll get back to that.

03:17:22.178 --> 03:17:25.545
TALIESIN: In a map? Should we mark this
on the map then, with a pin?

03:17:25.545 --> 03:17:27.346
LIAM: I was speaking in metaphor.

03:17:27.346 --> 03:17:29.542
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I like those.

03:17:29.542 --> 03:17:34.696
SAM: What do we do? We can sneak in.
We can create a diversion.

03:17:34.696 --> 03:17:41.705
LAURA: We could create a diversion. Hold on,
let me see what kind of spells I have taken.

03:17:41.705 --> 03:17:44.293
SAM: But then to what end? We're going to
run in there and do what?

03:17:44.293 --> 03:17:48.121
TRAVIS: How far from the opening of
the tunnel that we're at, off to the left,

03:17:48.121 --> 03:17:50.569
are both of the fire giants?

03:17:52.249 --> 03:17:56.321
MATT: Make a perception check for me
to take in the details of the scenery.

03:17:58.823 --> 03:18:00.018
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:18:00.018 --> 03:18:07.655
MATT: No shit. Okay, not only, as you lean forward
and poke through, really assess the scene--

03:18:07.655 --> 03:18:12.844
I'll just pull out the map and show you, because
you rolled a natural 20. I'll be right back.

03:18:12.844 --> 03:18:15.523
TRAVIS: Got to love those Critical Role dice.

03:18:15.523 --> 03:18:18.078
MARISHA: So attractive, so sexy.

03:18:18.078 --> 03:18:23.531
LIAM: Perkins! You are such a fun player! Jeez!

03:18:23.531 --> 03:18:30.146
TRAVIS: You chaotic motherfucker. How much
shit can I throw on one person?

03:18:30.146 --> 03:18:35.257
LIAM: Such a 180 from Shale, when you were
here the last time.

03:18:37.907 --> 03:18:44.643
MATT: Here's where you guys are. This is the
tunnel. Because you rolled a natural 20, you can

03:18:44.728 --> 03:18:52.322
see on the other side a continuation. You gather
that when the Kryn traveled through, they probably

03:18:52.322 --> 03:18:58.228
had to make their way through this chamber, and
you gather from the surrounding and the vicinity,

03:18:58.228 --> 03:19:04.637
the obsidian was probably a difficult thing to
pass through for this worm, and probably

03:19:04.637 --> 03:19:08.860
why it was forced to briefly make its way
through this courtyard.

03:19:08.860 --> 03:19:11.100
TRAVIS: What is this? Where the fuck are we?

03:19:11.100 --> 03:19:16.712
SAM: Do we think that the Kryn went through
and were allowed to pass?

03:19:16.712 --> 03:19:21.622
LAURA: I bet that these people are posted here
<i>because</i> the Kryn came through.

03:19:21.622 --> 03:19:24.857
MATT: That's an interesting observation.

03:19:24.857 --> 03:19:32.761
TRAVIS: I think diplomacy will be
our best tactic. Let's use words.

03:19:32.761 --> 03:19:35.159
SAM: Let's offer them some food.

03:19:35.159 --> 03:19:40.844
TRAVIS: Yeah, it worked well before.
And the other fire giant--

03:19:40.844 --> 03:19:42.627
SAM: Is that the splatter of dead Spurt?

03:19:42.627 --> 03:19:45.391
MATT: Yeah, that's where Spurt met his end.

03:19:45.391 --> 03:19:46.566
SAM: Here lies Spurt.

03:19:46.566 --> 03:19:49.836
TRAVIS: The second fire giant is on this
side of the molten river of death?

03:19:49.836 --> 03:19:51.072
MATT: Right there.

03:19:51.072 --> 03:19:52.193
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, one.

03:19:52.193 --> 03:19:53.887
MATT: Then that's the other one
on the opposite side.

03:19:53.887 --> 03:19:56.867
TRAVIS: That's a fire giant? I thought
that was the citadel.

03:19:56.867 --> 03:19:59.212
MATT: No, the citadel's way that way.

03:19:59.212 --> 03:20:00.869
TRAVIS: Those are shields?!

03:20:00.869 --> 03:20:01.502
MATT: Yeah.

03:20:01.502 --> 03:20:04.397
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can't see the actual figure.

03:20:04.397 --> 03:20:10.038
LIAM: Yeah. That's a dude, double fisting, full on--

03:20:10.038 --> 03:20:12.074
TRAVIS: This the worst American Gladiators
course ever.

03:20:12.074 --> 03:20:16.222
(laughter)

03:20:16.222 --> 03:20:19.879
TRAVIS: He's right next to where we need to go.
It's a big problem.

03:20:19.879 --> 03:20:21.720
SAM: Pugil sticks.

03:20:21.720 --> 03:20:26.695
MATT: There's Laser and Target! And you're going
to fight: fucked!

03:20:26.695 --> 03:20:29.170
TRAVIS: Fire shield! Magma shield!

03:20:29.170 --> 03:20:38.386
LAURA: So potentially-- Okay, I have an idea. What
if, Caleb, you make your bubble then one of us

03:20:38.386 --> 03:20:43.890
just yells out to the fire giants, "Hey. We just
want to pass through; we don't want to have

03:20:43.890 --> 03:20:47.170
"anything to do with you. We're just chasing down
these dicks that passed through your land,

03:20:47.170 --> 03:20:52.579
"that's it." Then we hide in your bubble
so that they can't attack us.

03:20:52.579 --> 03:20:54.151
SAM: Then they know we are here.

03:20:54.151 --> 03:20:58.850
LAURA: Well, yeah, but what are we going to do?
We can't all be invisible and they're right here.

03:20:58.850 --> 03:21:01.320
TRAVIS: What happens after they attack us
in the bubble?

03:21:01.320 --> 03:21:04.202
TALIESIN: How much can the bubble take?

03:21:04.202 --> 03:21:06.693
LAURA: They can't get us through the bubble.

03:21:06.693 --> 03:21:10.435
LIAM: Maybe they will go to sleep eventually.
Maybe we can come back a little later.

03:21:10.435 --> 03:21:13.928
LAURA: You don't think they're going to have other
sentries posted when they leave their post?

03:21:14.303 --> 03:21:16.874
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know about
the bubble thing.

03:21:16.874 --> 03:21:20.296
TALIESIN: I can throw my voice if we have to.

03:21:20.296 --> 03:21:22.992
TRAVIS: What if it breaks, what about
when it expires?

03:21:22.992 --> 03:21:27.488
LAURA: I'm just saying in the tunnel.
It's just an extra bonus of being in the

03:21:27.488 --> 03:21:29.477
tunnel and extra protection or something.

03:21:29.477 --> 03:21:31.451
SAM: We could have it there
in case we need to retreat.

03:21:31.451 --> 03:21:34.946
LIAM: Yeah, if we are crazy enough to start
a fight with these two--

03:21:34.946 --> 03:21:37.391
LAURA: Which I don't want to do. I just
want to talk to them.

03:21:37.391 --> 03:21:40.276
LIAM: But if we do, the bubble is a good idea,
although I have to stay in the bubble

03:21:40.276 --> 03:21:43.539
for the bubble to be in effect.

03:21:43.539 --> 03:21:49.655
TRAVIS: Non-fighting options: I can take one
person with me, 90 feet, in a single direction.

03:21:49.655 --> 03:21:53.326
TALIESIN: I can also make my voice, I believe,
come from wherever I like within 30 feet.

03:21:53.326 --> 03:21:56.703
MARISHA: I mean, use a distraction,
get them looking at something else.

03:21:56.703 --> 03:21:59.648
TALIESIN: Just to have a conversation with these
guys, see if they're willing to make a deal.

03:21:59.648 --> 03:22:01.803
SAM: Jester can get across the entire span.

03:22:01.803 --> 03:22:03.492
LAURA: Yes, I could do it.

03:22:03.492 --> 03:22:06.261
SAM: I could turn invisible.
I could create a diversion.

03:22:06.261 --> 03:22:11.833
MARISHA: I am a great sprinter, like,
real good, 100 meter dash.

03:22:11.833 --> 03:22:12.655
SAM: Sure.

03:22:12.655 --> 03:22:14.511
MARISHA: Right, just saying.

03:22:14.511 --> 03:22:16.015
TALIESIN: I can get across.

03:22:16.015 --> 03:22:21.531
TRAVIS: I could create a false diversion that's a
massive beast in the opposite direction of us

03:22:21.531 --> 03:22:23.373
or I could make a real beast.

03:22:23.373 --> 03:22:28.282
LAURA: Yeah, can you make it look like 
it comes from the cave and then runs off

03:22:28.282 --> 03:22:31.268
so that it doesn't appear out of nowhere?

03:22:31.268 --> 03:22:33.302
MARISHA: Which cave? Our cave?

03:22:33.302 --> 03:22:36.270
LAURA: Or the other cave maybe, no.
I don't know.

03:22:36.270 --> 03:22:37.994
SAM: Or just emerge from the lava.

03:22:37.994 --> 03:22:40.065
LAURA: Or just come out of the lava.

03:22:40.065 --> 03:22:42.898
MARISHA: Ooh. Lava monster.

03:22:42.898 --> 03:22:49.430
LIAM: What about this? What if Fjord does
that distraction we talked about across the fire.

03:22:49.430 --> 03:22:57.760
You Banished that stone creature? I know
how to do that as well. If you and I both

03:22:57.760 --> 03:23:02.550
take a shot at the one on our side,
one of us maybe will succeed.

03:23:02.550 --> 03:23:07.447
TALIESIN: If I hit it with Bane beforehand it
would also have a slightly harder time doing that.

03:23:07.447 --> 03:23:15.343
LAURA: Oof. But it could also succeed against us
and then we'll have to fight a giant. I think it

03:23:15.343 --> 03:23:21.076
would be better if, you know, I could Dimension
Door with you, Caleb, over to the other side.

03:23:21.076 --> 03:23:22.036
LIAM: And?

03:23:22.036 --> 03:23:25.888
LAURA: And then we just keep going.
We never engage with these fucks.

03:23:25.888 --> 03:23:28.455
SAM: Wait, what about us? What about the
rest of us? You're just going to leave us?

03:23:28.455 --> 03:23:31.357
LAURA: Well, he's going to make a
big distraction and then we all run.

03:23:31.357 --> 03:23:43.814
TALIESIN: I have a sneaking suspicion that
there's probably-- These giants are fast,

03:23:43.814 --> 03:23:49.905
faster than we are. Probably with some range.

03:23:49.905 --> 03:23:54.989
MARISHA: Would I know anything about giants,
reading up on them or anything?

03:23:54.989 --> 03:24:01.193
MATT: Go ahead and roll a history check for me.

03:24:01.193 --> 03:24:06.273
MARISHA: Cobalt. 19.

03:24:06.273 --> 03:24:15.085
MATT: They generally live beneath mountain ranges
and areas of heavy volcanic activity. They are

03:24:15.085 --> 03:24:32.945
considered the artisan crafters and forgers of
giant kin and the Ordning. They have-- They're evil.

03:24:33.481 --> 03:24:35.657
TRAVIS: Oh, they both are?

03:24:35.657 --> 03:24:37.899
MATT: No, that's just giants.

03:24:37.899 --> 03:24:46.048
MARISHA: So probably not amicable
or prone to negotiation?

03:24:46.048 --> 03:24:55.364
MATT: They can be. If it suits them well.
They enjoy free labor, so they like to

03:24:55.364 --> 03:24:58.752
take slaves to force to do the menial tasks.

03:24:58.752 --> 03:25:02.913
MARISHA: And they craft things so
they're not stupid?

03:25:02.913 --> 03:25:09.747
MATT: No. They're intelligent like
an average being would be.

03:25:09.747 --> 03:25:11.847
MARISHA: Averagely smart.

03:25:11.847 --> 03:25:17.031
MATT: From what you've heard. You don't
have a whole lot of knowledge necessarily.

03:25:17.031 --> 03:25:22.523
You haven't heard of tales of the great
crafty intelligence, but nevertheless,

03:25:22.523 --> 03:25:26.115
they still built this entire underground city.

03:25:26.115 --> 03:25:29.750
MARISHA: Yeah, I read this tome once in
the library, but I was a little distracted

03:25:30.112 --> 03:25:34.299
when reading it because the monks had also
drawn a bunch of dick and dudes putting

03:25:34.299 --> 03:25:38.308
horns up their butts in the margins.
It just happens, yeah.

03:25:38.308 --> 03:25:40.959
LAURA: Shut up. Wait, which library was this?

03:25:40.959 --> 03:25:42.327
MARISHA: In the Cobalt Soul.

03:25:42.327 --> 03:25:43.557
SAM: Focus.

03:25:43.557 --> 03:25:49.504
TRAVIS: I have a suggestion. I can make a
manticore appear, run from the cave and leap/fly

03:25:49.504 --> 03:25:54.180
over the river and carry off in the direction
that is opposite of where we need to go.

03:25:54.180 --> 03:25:56.255
LAURA: Yeah. Then we all run.

03:25:56.255 --> 03:25:59.232
SAM: Is this a real manticore or is it
an image of one?

03:25:59.232 --> 03:26:05.565
TRAVIS: It sounds and looks like a real manticore,
but if you make contact with it, it's just an illusion.

03:26:05.565 --> 03:26:12.686
LIAM: While they are all debating this, I channel
a little bit of transmutive energy into my

03:26:12.686 --> 03:26:19.001
stone and change its focus from constitution
to fire resistance for myself.

03:26:19.001 --> 03:26:24.607
TRAVIS: So you can go invisible, you can go
the entire distance, you're fast as balls.

03:26:24.861 --> 03:26:26.482
LAURA: Go the distance!

03:26:26.482 --> 03:26:28.276
TRAVIS: Caleb's fast as balls.

03:26:28.276 --> 03:26:31.147
TALIESIN: I can briefly go invisible,
but not for this whole run.

03:26:31.147 --> 03:26:32.589
LIAM: Not today, I didn't study that last night.

03:26:32.589 --> 03:26:34.057
TRAVIS: I can take one person with me.

03:26:34.057 --> 03:26:36.348
LAURA: Can you get that far, too?

03:26:36.348 --> 03:26:38.273
TRAVIS: With one person.

03:26:38.273 --> 03:26:41.558
TALIESIN: Mister Caleb is the one to go.

03:26:41.558 --> 03:26:43.037
SAM: What about Yasha?

03:26:43.037 --> 03:26:45.709
LAURA: Somebody take Caleb. I'll take Yasha.

03:26:45.709 --> 03:26:47.286
SAM: You can't take Yasha.

03:26:47.286 --> 03:26:50.085
LAURA: Why?

03:26:50.085 --> 03:26:52.639
SAM: She's bigger than you.

03:26:52.639 --> 03:26:55.062
MATT: They're both medium sized.

03:26:55.062 --> 03:26:55.930
LAURA: Yeah. She's not large.

03:26:55.930 --> 03:27:00.670
TRAVIS: Who's the odd man out? Who doesn't
have a way to get over there real quick?

03:27:01.051 --> 03:27:02.799
SAM: I can run and I'm invisible.

03:27:02.799 --> 03:27:05.888
MARISHA: How fast can you run?
You're pretty fast.

03:27:05.888 --> 03:27:08.266
LIAM: Yeah, it's you two.
You are the quickest.

03:27:08.266 --> 03:27:13.543
TALIESIN: I can be invisible for one run--
for one action.

03:27:13.543 --> 03:27:16.923
TRAVIS: How long is your speed?

03:27:16.923 --> 03:27:19.101
TALIESIN: I can get 60 feet.

03:27:19.101 --> 03:27:24.276
LAURA: I could Blessing Of The Trickster
you here and that way you're a little

03:27:24.276 --> 03:27:26.349
more stealthy as you're going.

03:27:26.349 --> 03:27:29.309
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean, I'll be invisible
until I'm visible.

03:27:29.309 --> 03:27:32.437
TRAVIS: Nott, how do you feel about---

03:27:32.437 --> 03:27:35.889
LAURA: I could Polymorph someone!

03:27:35.889 --> 03:27:37.059
SAM: Into what?

03:27:37.059 --> 03:27:38.582
LAURA: Into something that, you know—

03:27:38.582 --> 03:27:39.559
SAM: Dragonfly.

03:27:39.559 --> 03:27:43.275
LAURA: Yeah! That can get across! I could
Polymorph. I could Polymorph you

03:27:43.275 --> 03:27:46.217
and I could Dimension Door me and Yasha.

03:27:46.217 --> 03:27:47.870
TRAVIS: Sure, okay.

03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:53.214
MATT: You hear this heavy smacking sound as
the fire giant on your side of this courtyard

03:27:53.214 --> 03:27:58.142
is putting to bed the rest of the bees that
have been harrying its kneecap.

03:27:58.142 --> 03:28:01.600
TRAVIS: Caleb, do you have a plan?

03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:02.822
LIAM: A plan?

03:28:02.822 --> 03:28:04.639
TRAVIS: To get across?

03:28:04.639 --> 03:28:06.583
LIAM: I'm the odd man out.

03:28:06.583 --> 03:28:07.689
TRAVIS: I'm asking.

03:28:07.689 --> 03:28:11.420
LIAM: No, there are many things I could do,
but I did not do my homework last night

03:28:11.420 --> 03:28:13.551
that would facilitate those things.

03:28:13.551 --> 03:28:15.613
SAM: Are you going to bamf with him?
Weren't you going to Dimension Door?

03:28:15.613 --> 03:28:17.649
LAURA: One of us needs to take Yasha,
one of us needs to take Caleb.

03:28:17.649 --> 03:28:19.402
TRAVIS: I'm taking Caleb.

03:28:19.402 --> 03:28:20.618
LAURA: I'll take Yasha.

03:28:20.618 --> 03:28:22.081
TRAVIS: You're running balls, you're invisible.

03:28:22.081 --> 03:28:22.978
SAM: How far can you go?

03:28:22.978 --> 03:28:23.741
TRAVIS: 90 feet.

03:28:23.741 --> 03:28:28.776
SAM: That is not across the way. That is just to
the other side of the bridge, maybe.

03:28:28.776 --> 03:28:31.563
LAURA: I thought you could go farther than that,
Fjord, that's not as far.

03:28:31.563 --> 03:28:34.763
TRAVIS: It would be pretty close. We're going to
send both of them in the opposite direction.

03:28:34.763 --> 03:28:36.930
MARISHA: Are we dashing partners, me and you?

03:28:36.930 --> 03:28:37.681
SAM: Yeah.

03:28:37.681 --> 03:28:38.581
MARISHA: All right.

03:28:38.581 --> 03:28:41.521
TRAVIS: Yeah. We don't do any of this until they
fucking move away from where we need to go.

03:28:41.521 --> 03:28:42.267
Ready?

03:28:42.267 --> 03:28:43.127
MARISHA: I like it.

03:28:43.127 --> 03:28:48.250
LAURA: Wait. How about <i>I</i> take Caleb the entire
distance, you and Yasha bamf 90 feet and run

03:28:48.250 --> 03:28:51.067
because Caleb is squishy.

03:28:51.067 --> 03:28:52.963
TRAVIS: Sure, sounds good, I like it.

03:28:52.963 --> 03:28:55.523
TALIESIN: Should I be invisible at the beginning
or at the end?

03:28:55.523 --> 03:28:57.120
LAURA: Do you want to be Polymorphed?

03:28:57.120 --> 03:28:59.531
TALIESIN: I can be invisible for 60 feet.

03:28:59.531 --> 03:29:02.045
LAURA: Okay, well I won't be able to
Polymorph you once you're out.

03:29:02.045 --> 03:29:04.666
TALIESIN: I'll Polymorph, then, I guess.

03:29:04.666 --> 03:29:07.779
LAURA: Do you keep your intelligence
when you're polymorphed?

03:29:07.779 --> 03:29:10.883
TRAVIS: Here's the order. You're going to
Polymorph Caduceus. You're going to go invisible

03:29:10.883 --> 03:29:14.237
and get started. I'm going to set the diversion
and then we start going.

03:29:14.237 --> 03:29:16.317
MARISHA: And then we're going to go. Okay.

03:29:16.317 --> 03:29:20.024
SAM: Do you need me to do anything to make the
diversion look even more realistic?

03:29:20.024 --> 03:29:21.446
TRAVIS: I don't think so.

03:29:21.446 --> 03:29:22.995
SAM: Because I could--

03:29:22.995 --> 03:29:29.668
LIAM: Jester, bring the haversack over, open it up
so that Beauregard can focus on the mote of possibility.

03:29:29.668 --> 03:29:30.519
LAURA: Here, Beau.

03:29:30.519 --> 03:29:32.165
MARISHA: Is that bad? Is that going to
send stuff to-- okay.

03:29:32.165 --> 03:29:33.677
LAURA: Don't take it out just let it in.

03:29:33.677 --> 03:29:36.105
LIAM: Just look into the bag.
Just like huffing gasoline.

03:29:36.105 --> 03:29:38.903
MARISHA: (deep inhale)

03:29:38.903 --> 03:29:41.020
SAM: Oh, you're huffing literally right now?

03:29:41.020 --> 03:29:45.680
MATT: Okay, you take a moment
and focus on the dodecahedron.

03:29:45.680 --> 03:29:47.391
TRAVIS: You are doing that?

03:29:47.391 --> 03:29:49.324
LAURA and LIAM: It's in the bag.

03:29:49.324 --> 03:29:52.974
MATT: You take your fragment of possibility.

03:29:52.974 --> 03:29:55.401
LIAM: Beauregard's face goes into
another dimension for a moment.

03:29:55.401 --> 03:29:57.820
SAM: You got silver paint all over.

03:29:57.820 --> 03:30:03.329
(laughter)

03:30:03.329 --> 03:30:04.239
MARISHA: Okay.

03:30:04.239 --> 03:30:12.123
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Blessing Of The
Trickster you. You're still super stealthy,

03:30:12.123 --> 03:30:13.368
I don't know if it matters.

03:30:13.368 --> 03:30:14.217
SAM: Jester.

03:30:14.217 --> 03:30:15.087
LAURA: What?

03:30:15.087 --> 03:30:18.116
SAM: It was so wonderful having Nugget around.

03:30:18.116 --> 03:30:21.557
LAURA: Nugget's just going to run out and he's
going to blink and blink and blink as far as he can.

03:30:21.557 --> 03:30:23.211
SAM: He's going to be fine.

03:30:23.211 --> 03:30:25.216
LAURA: Yeah. He's going to be fine.

03:30:25.216 --> 03:30:28.768
TALIESIN: I'm also going to add resistance to
you so you can add a d4 to any saving throw

03:30:28.768 --> 03:30:31.192
for the next 60 seconds.

03:30:31.192 --> 03:30:34.501
LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks.

03:30:34.501 --> 03:30:37.436
TALIESIN: You can add a d4 to any saving throw.

03:30:40.566 --> 03:30:42.344
MATT: All right.

03:30:42.344 --> 03:30:47.012
TRAVIS: I turn to Yasha and say: When I give
you the signal, you and I are going to run

03:30:47.276 --> 03:30:51.519
towards the river of magma and hold on tight.

03:30:51.519 --> 03:30:52.925
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:30:52.925 --> 03:30:55.080
MATT: You guys are over on this side here.

03:30:55.080 --> 03:30:58.673
SAM: This is going to go so good.

03:30:58.673 --> 03:31:02.150
TALIESIN: This is going to go great.
It's a great plan.

03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:05.692
SAM: Mighty Nein, we have to do this
for the memory of Spurt.

03:31:05.692 --> 03:31:07.486
TALIESIN: Who?

03:31:07.486 --> 03:31:08.774
SAM: For Spurt!

03:31:08.774 --> 03:31:09.962
LAURA: He was so cute.

03:31:09.962 --> 03:31:14.059
SAM: The kobold who was just introduced to us
and killed.

03:31:14.059 --> 03:31:17.883
LAURA: Okay, what should I make you?
What do you want to be?

03:31:17.883 --> 03:31:22.257
TALIESIN: I don't know. Man, there are so many
options. What would be fun? I don't know.

03:31:22.257 --> 03:31:23.636
LAURA: Maybe a dragonfly could be really cool.

03:31:23.636 --> 03:31:25.747
TALIESIN: I mean, dragonflies are pretty cool.

03:31:25.747 --> 03:31:26.733
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:31:26.733 --> 03:31:32.576
LAURA: Okay. Well, if you're a dragonfly, will
you remember what you're supposed to do?

03:31:32.576 --> 03:31:35.244
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know, but to be fair,
I'm not sure if I remember

03:31:35.244 --> 03:31:37.418
what I'm supposed to do anyway.

03:31:37.418 --> 03:31:40.421
MATT: While you guys are working out the
specifics, I'm going to grab something real fast.

03:31:40.421 --> 03:31:42.060
Keep talking amongst yourselves.

03:31:42.060 --> 03:31:46.848
LAURA: If you cast Polymorph-- If I were to cast
it on myself, I would remember what I was doing.

03:31:46.848 --> 03:31:51.715
LIAM: Yes, you keep all your thoughts.
Look, there's the creative lead

03:31:51.715 --> 03:31:53.891
of Dungeons &amp; Dragons over there.

03:31:53.891 --> 03:31:56.714
TALIESIN: Who would be like: "Um, actually--"

03:31:56.714 --> 03:32:00.565
LIAM: You take all the stat adjustments except for
your brains in there, so all your decision making

03:32:00.565 --> 03:32:05.557
is the same. But dexterity saves and stuff,
that's the creature's stats, right?

03:32:05.557 --> 03:32:08.789
TRAVIS: But Nugget's like, in your pocket, right?

03:32:08.789 --> 03:32:11.762
LAURA: No, Sprinkle's in my pocket.

03:32:11.762 --> 03:32:15.777
SAM: Doesn't everyone have the creative lead
of D&amp;D next to them when they play a game?

03:32:15.777 --> 03:32:19.733
TALIESIN: You get the limited edition
from the local store, you know.

03:32:19.733 --> 03:32:21.753
LAURA: I actually have a question, Matt.

03:32:21.753 --> 03:32:22.411
MATT: Yes?

03:32:22.411 --> 03:32:25.909
LAURA: When I Dimension Door, I can take
another creature.

03:32:25.909 --> 03:32:26.734
MATT: Yes.

03:32:26.734 --> 03:32:31.190
LAURA: Does that mean I can't have Sprinkle on me
or else I won't be able to take Caleb.

03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:32.208
MATT: Correct.

03:32:32.817 --> 03:32:38.621
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to take Sprinkle off, out
of my hood. Okay, Beau? Take care of Sprinkle.

03:32:38.621 --> 03:32:40.401
TALIESIN: It's on you.

03:32:40.401 --> 03:32:47.374
LAURA: No, it's okay, Sprinkle. Just hold onto him
when you run, okay? Don't let him get left behind.

03:32:47.374 --> 03:32:50.452
MARISHA: Can't he do-- He's more
magical than I am.

03:32:50.452 --> 03:32:52.716
LAURA: It's Sprinkle, he's my weasel.

03:32:52.716 --> 03:32:53.351
MARISHA: Oh.

03:32:53.351 --> 03:33:04.608
LIAM: Just imagine if Jester had teleported away
and went with Sprinkle and Caleb is just going: Uh?

03:33:04.608 --> 03:33:06.003
MATT: I love it.

03:33:06.003 --> 03:33:10.960
LAURA: Nugget's going to blink, blink, blink.

03:33:10.960 --> 03:33:20.107
TALIESIN: I'm going to hide, probably in your
pocket. I'm going to hide on you as the dragonfly.

03:33:20.107 --> 03:33:22.609
MARISHA: Okay. I'm a one-woman petting zoo.
Let's go.

03:33:22.609 --> 03:33:25.153
TRAVIS: Three, two, one.

03:33:25.153 --> 03:33:26.607
LAURA: Polymorph.

03:33:26.607 --> 03:33:28.147
SAM: Invisible!

03:33:28.147 --> 03:33:30.341
MATT: So what order are we doing this, guys?

03:33:30.341 --> 03:33:31.585
LAURA: Polymorph.

03:33:31.585 --> 03:33:33.185
SAM: Invisible!

03:33:33.185 --> 03:33:35.576
MATT: So you're Polymorphing Caduceus into what?

03:33:35.576 --> 03:33:37.314
LAURA and TALIESIN: A dragonfly.

03:33:37.314 --> 03:33:39.924
TRAVIS: Get your head start, both of you.

03:33:39.924 --> 03:33:43.965
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of that,
we'll say this is you.

03:33:43.965 --> 03:33:46.606
MARISHA: You're hitching a ride on me.

03:33:46.606 --> 03:33:49.200
TALIESIN: I'm going to hitch a ride on you.

03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:54.011
MATT: All right. The dragonfly jumps onto Beau.
Beau is now in the position to hold—

03:33:54.011 --> 03:33:56.696
TRAVIS: You're not just going to fly across
the room by yourself?

03:33:56.696 --> 03:33:57.801
TALIESIN: She's faster.

03:33:57.801 --> 03:33:59.903
LIAM: Beauregard is now Noah's ark.

03:33:59.903 --> 03:34:02.961
TALIESIN: You are the Mighty Menagerie.

03:34:02.961 --> 03:34:07.881
TRAVIS: Beau and Nott, I'm going to give you
15 seconds before we start.

03:34:07.881 --> 03:34:12.159
SAM: I think we should start with the monster.

03:34:12.159 --> 03:34:13.952
TRAVIS: It's your call.

03:34:13.952 --> 03:34:16.885
SAM: Because if I go out there and trip,
the jig is up.

03:34:16.885 --> 03:34:19.211
TRAVIS: Are you going to trip?

03:34:19.211 --> 03:34:21.248
LAURA: Plus, it's expecting something
to come out the door.

03:34:21.248 --> 03:34:30.423
TRAVIS: All right, fine. I will use Major Image
and I will cast the image of a manticore

03:34:30.423 --> 03:34:37.522
climbing out of the magma river on this side
of the bank, roaring at the fire giant

03:34:37.522 --> 03:34:40.755
and then leap, flying over to the other side.

03:34:40.755 --> 03:34:42.252
MATT: Okay.

03:34:42.252 --> 03:34:44.039
TALIESIN: That's epic.

03:34:44.039 --> 03:34:48.079
SAM: Jar of peanut butter? Get ready for a dick.

03:34:48.079 --> 03:34:56.200
(laughter)

03:34:56.200 --> 03:35:06.761
MATT: Out of the molten rock. Wings. (growling)
The manticore begins to rise. Both of the giants

03:35:06.761 --> 03:35:12.520
look confused towards it and then each other. The
one with the shields braces the shields in front.

03:35:13.028 --> 03:35:17.141
The other one, looking off to the side, goes and
reaches off to one of the boulders off to the side

03:35:17.141 --> 03:35:21.262
and grabs it. As it picks it up, those at the
front can see, the rock seems to heat up. There

03:35:21.262 --> 03:35:29.591
are veins of heat on the inside as it grips it. So
you create the effect. This is Major Image, right?

03:35:29.591 --> 03:35:33.018
SAM: Major Image. Visuals and sounds.

03:35:33.018 --> 03:35:34.531
TRAVIS: Visuals and sounds.

03:35:34.531 --> 03:35:38.523
MATT: Yes. All right. They're both going to look
forward towards it to see what the hell it is.

03:35:38.523 --> 03:35:42.178
Watching a manticore rise out of magma is insane.

03:35:42.178 --> 03:35:43.575
LIAM: Very heavy metal.

03:35:43.575 --> 03:35:44.691
MATT: Correct.

03:35:44.691 --> 03:35:46.997
TRAVIS: Yeah, he comes out here, roars,
and then jumps over.

03:35:46.997 --> 03:35:54.181
MATT: Correct. The guy with the shields, he's
attempting to ascertain, with his investigation,

03:35:54.181 --> 03:36:00.092
as to what the fuck is going on. He rolled
a natural 19 minus one. That's an 18.

03:36:00.092 --> 03:36:02.061
What's your spell DC?

03:36:02.061 --> 03:36:08.151
TRAVIS: I think it's a 16. Shit. Where the hell is
that on this thing?

03:36:08.151 --> 03:36:10.886
SAM: Perfect plan. Foiled on the first step.

03:36:10.886 --> 03:36:14.020
TRAVIS: Anyone know where that is?

03:36:14.020 --> 03:36:15.386
MARISHA: Your spell save DC?

03:36:15.386 --> 03:36:18.338
LAURA: It's right at the top of your--
If you hit Spells, it'll say at the top.

03:36:18.338 --> 03:36:19.433
TRAVIS: Oh. 16.

03:36:19.433 --> 03:36:24.743
MATT: Yeah. The one with the shields goes like--
just looks confused as it takes off.

03:36:24.743 --> 03:36:27.599
The other one...

03:36:27.599 --> 03:36:31.158
LIAM: One? 20?

03:36:31.158 --> 03:36:33.885
LAURA: What is it? Is it a natural 20?

03:36:33.885 --> 03:36:35.812
MATT: No, I literally rolled two 19s in a row.

03:36:35.812 --> 03:36:36.659
LAURA and LIAM: Aw.

03:36:36.659 --> 03:36:38.201
MATT: I'm sorry!

03:36:38.201 --> 03:36:39.611
TRAVIS: I'm not.

03:36:39.611 --> 03:36:45.171
MATT: As the manticore takes off, the one holding
the rock is like-- It twists the rock in the other

03:36:45.171 --> 03:36:53.944
hand and reaches over to the side and grabs a
chain and starts ringing this loud bell. It's

03:36:53.944 --> 03:36:59.826
echoing through the chamber. They're both
confused as this thing flies off and

03:36:59.826 --> 03:37:01.504
they look at each other like--

03:37:01.504 --> 03:37:03.086
LAURA: Are they looking at each other?

03:37:03.086 --> 03:37:05.670
MATT: Yeah, they're looking at each other.
What's up next?

03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:07.151
LAURA: Should we--

03:37:07.151 --> 03:37:10.582
MARISHA: Run? Plan still goes?

03:37:10.582 --> 03:37:13.417
MATT: I can't believe I rolled-- It was such
a great idea, I just rolled really high!

03:37:13.417 --> 03:37:16.073
LAURA: Do we have any other thingies?

03:37:16.073 --> 03:37:20.279
SAM: Is Invisibility? It's concentration.
I can't do anything else.

03:37:20.279 --> 03:37:25.753
MARISHA: I still have bottle rockets.
That's all I got.

03:37:25.753 --> 03:37:27.533
MATT: Who's doing what?

03:37:27.533 --> 03:37:29.654
LAURA: Hold on!

03:37:29.654 --> 03:37:32.123
LIAM: They're clanging?

03:37:32.123 --> 03:37:37.362
TRAVIS: If we run out of here are we--
How far is his melee, ten feet?

03:37:37.362 --> 03:37:38.837
MATT: You don't know.

03:37:38.837 --> 03:37:40.527
SAM: I would say 20.

03:37:40.527 --> 03:37:41.915
TRAVIS: Massive.

03:37:41.915 --> 03:37:44.133
LIAM: It's probably ten or 15.

03:37:44.133 --> 03:37:50.479
MATT: You would imagine it has larger reach
than an average creature, being a giant.

03:37:50.479 --> 03:37:59.115
LAURA: Well, should we just wait
until it dies down then go?

03:37:59.115 --> 03:38:07.576
LIAM: Hey, I'll do it. Caleb leans out the
passageway and casts Polymorph on the giant.

03:38:07.576 --> 03:38:10.747
MATT: On the giant? Okay.
What's the save on that?

03:38:10.747 --> 03:38:16.403
LIAM: It is 16, I believe.

03:38:16.403 --> 03:38:17.842
MATT: 16 wisdom?

03:38:17.842 --> 03:38:19.551
LIAM: 16 wisdom.

03:38:19.551 --> 03:38:24.663
MATT: You got it. For that one, five.

03:38:24.663 --> 03:38:26.247
LIAM: It's a cow.

03:38:26.247 --> 03:38:33.146
MATT: (laughs) All right. I don't have a
cow mini on me at the moment.

03:38:33.146 --> 03:38:34.489
TALIESIN: My god, man.

03:38:34.489 --> 03:38:35.779
MARISHA: How dare you.

03:38:35.779 --> 03:38:39.629
MATT: I know. How fucking dare I?
I'll use this horse.

03:38:39.629 --> 03:38:42.673
LIAM: You call yourself a dungeon master? Jesus.

03:38:42.673 --> 03:38:47.070
MATT: So the fire giant suddenly (swoosh) (moo).

03:38:47.070 --> 03:38:49.796
ALL: (yelling) Go! Run!

03:38:49.796 --> 03:38:51.803
TRAVIS: We break out. Yasha and I run.

03:38:51.803 --> 03:38:55.231
MATT: The one over here goes and looks
confused at that.

03:38:55.231 --> 03:38:59.532
Everyone needs to roll initiative on this
because you're entered official combat.

03:38:59.532 --> 03:39:02.206
MARISHA: (singing) Don't fuck me, Gil.

03:39:02.206 --> 03:39:10.267
LIAM: Oh my god. One. Well, wait, no. There's
no natural ones in initiative. That's a three.

03:39:10.267 --> 03:39:11.650
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:39:11.650 --> 03:39:12.580
ALL: Eyy!

03:39:12.580 --> 03:39:15.182
MATT: All righty. 25 to 20.

03:39:15.182 --> 03:39:17.669
LAURA: 20 plus four. 24.

03:39:17.669 --> 03:39:18.853
MARISHA: 26.

03:39:18.853 --> 03:39:20.160
MATT: Damn, Beau.

03:39:20.160 --> 03:39:22.053
MARISHA: I'm going to burn my boots.

03:39:22.053 --> 03:39:26.018
MATT: All right. 20 to 15.

03:39:26.018 --> 03:39:27.040
TALIESIN: 18.

03:39:27.040 --> 03:39:28.020
TRAVIS: 19.

03:39:28.020 --> 03:39:34.002
LIAM: If anyone attacks the cow, I'm going to
beat you up in the lobby tonight. Don't do it.

03:39:34.002 --> 03:39:36.082
LAURA: Who would attack the cow?

03:39:36.082 --> 03:39:37.489
MATT: 15 to ten?

03:39:37.489 --> 03:39:39.829
TRAVIS: Yasha hates cows.

03:39:39.829 --> 03:39:41.341
MATT: No one 15 to ten?

03:39:41.341 --> 03:39:43.687
LIAM: (like Yasha) A cow killed my wife.

03:39:43.687 --> 03:39:45.310
LAURA: What did Yasha roll?

03:39:45.310 --> 03:39:46.267
TRAVIS: Nine.

03:39:46.267 --> 03:39:47.505
MATT: All right. So Yasha's at nine?

03:39:47.505 --> 03:39:48.286
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:39:48.286 --> 03:39:49.802
SAM: Seven.

03:39:49.802 --> 03:39:55.380
LAURA: Hey, Caleb. Polymorph happens
immediately so you can do it again.

03:39:55.380 --> 03:39:57.743
MATT: Caleb at three.

03:39:57.743 --> 03:39:59.423
LAURA: Oh, you're at the bottom.

03:39:59.423 --> 03:40:01.615
LIAM: Yeah. It's concentration.

03:40:01.615 --> 03:40:03.684
MATT: All right. Beau, you're up first.

03:40:03.684 --> 03:40:07.883
MARISHA: I am hauling ass across the bridge.

03:40:07.883 --> 03:40:10.386
MATT: All right. (counting)

03:40:10.386 --> 03:40:12.286
SAM: Oh no, the giant totally sees you.

03:40:12.286 --> 03:40:16.487
MARISHA: Step of the wind, step of the wind, step
of the wind!

03:40:16.487 --> 03:40:19.811
MATT: As a bonus action. (counting)

03:40:19.811 --> 03:40:24.011
MARISHA: I get to move 45 feet-- is my movement,
so add ten more to both of those.

03:40:24.011 --> 03:40:25.738
MATT: Oh, right. It's actually ten more,
and you still have your action.

03:40:25.738 --> 03:40:31.043
MARISHA: I don't want to get close to that guy.
I'm going to parkour, and then action to run

03:40:31.043 --> 03:40:36.852
again, but I'm going to swing a little wide.
I don't want to fuck with this guy.

03:40:36.852 --> 03:40:41.759
MATT and MARISHA: (counting)

03:40:41.759 --> 03:40:48.298
MATT: Beau goes (swoosh) and is already on the
opposite side. The giant with the shields goes,

03:40:48.573 --> 03:40:55.112
(exasperated grunt) and goes to go for a shove and
watches her vanish and goes, (confused grunt)

03:40:55.112 --> 03:40:58.640
and looks back at the tunnel on the other side.
She completely just skids off, no effect.

03:40:58.640 --> 03:41:00.344
LIAM: Usain Bolt just comes (swoosh).

03:41:00.344 --> 03:41:02.889
TALIESIN: I'm also un-Polymorphed
over there, as well.

03:41:02.961 --> 03:41:05.723
MARISHA: When we get to the other side,
I smack Caduceus.

03:41:05.723 --> 03:41:07.099
TALIESIN: Just squeeze. That's all you've got to--

03:41:07.099 --> 03:41:09.914
MATT: Okay, so you go, (smacking and falling)
and Caduceus suddenly apparates

03:41:09.914 --> 03:41:15.311
next to you, almost collapsing you from
the weight of his much larger body.

03:41:15.311 --> 03:41:16.295
TALIESIN: Hi.

03:41:16.295 --> 03:41:17.827
MARISHA: All right, get off.

03:41:17.827 --> 03:41:20.452
MATT: You got it, all right. That finishes
your go. Jester, you're up.

03:41:20.452 --> 03:41:26.501
LAURA: I'm going to run up, grab Caleb and
Dimension Door to the other side.

03:41:26.501 --> 03:41:31.118
MATT: All right. (swoosh) On the other
side of the tunnel.

03:41:31.118 --> 03:41:32.754
SAM: Oh no, it's just us.

03:41:32.754 --> 03:41:35.815
MATT: All right, that finishes Jester's go.
Fjord, you're up.

03:41:35.815 --> 03:41:38.390
TRAVIS: I need Yasha.

03:41:38.390 --> 03:41:43.825
LAURA: Nugget's going to run and starts running
out and fucking blinking as well, oh my god!

03:41:43.825 --> 03:41:45.755
TRAVIS: (poofing)

03:41:45.755 --> 03:41:47.990
MATT: There we go. Got me a horse.

03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:49.403
MARISHA: What is happening?

03:41:49.403 --> 03:41:52.191
LIAM: (barking, poofing)

03:41:52.191 --> 03:41:57.432
MATT: Nugget comes out. Blink dogs have
a movement of 40, so that's (counting).

03:41:57.432 --> 03:41:58.694
LAURA: Oh no, he's so cute.

03:41:58.694 --> 03:42:00.591
SAM: Oh, that's pretty fast.

03:42:01.098 --> 03:42:04.019
MATT: He's going to do action to run as well,
(counting) and then is going to use his

03:42:04.019 --> 03:42:23.262
teleport ability, which he gets to teleport
40 feet. Gets right there. (panting, teleporting).

03:42:23.334 --> 03:42:28.071
That finishes your go. Fjord,
what are you doing?

03:42:28.071 --> 03:42:32.220
TRAVIS: Fjord's going to run out and hug to the
right, and he's going to head in this direction

03:42:32.220 --> 03:42:35.391
towards the magma river and go:
Yasha, come on!

03:42:35.391 --> 03:42:36.647
MATT: All right.

03:42:36.647 --> 03:42:43.003
TRAVIS: 30 feet, okay. That's it. Awesome.
Yeah, and I will hold Thunder Step

03:42:43.003 --> 03:42:45.655
until Yasha is next to me.

03:42:45.655 --> 03:42:51.356
MATT: You got it. All righty.
That ends your turn?

03:42:51.356 --> 03:42:52.270
TRAVIS: It does.

03:42:52.270 --> 03:42:53.497
MARISHA: She's next, right? No?

03:42:53.497 --> 03:42:55.019
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

03:42:55.019 --> 03:42:57.370
TALIESIN: I'm going to poke my head out
and cast Blindness on the giant.

03:42:57.370 --> 03:43:01.126
MATT: (counting) You get there to cast it?

03:43:01.126 --> 03:43:01.987
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:43:01.987 --> 03:43:04.144
MATT: All right. What's the DC on that?

03:43:04.144 --> 03:43:05.753
TALIESIN: 16 constitution.

03:43:05.753 --> 03:43:12.543
MATT: Constitution. 26. They got a lot of
constitution, these fire giants.

03:43:12.543 --> 03:43:13.968
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. It was a good thought.

03:43:13.968 --> 03:43:15.400
MATT: Sorry.

03:43:15.400 --> 03:43:17.627
TALIESIN: That's all right. No, it was worth
the thought. I've got a bonus action,

03:43:17.627 --> 03:43:18.717
I suppose, still.

03:43:18.717 --> 03:43:19.526
MATT: You do.

03:43:19.526 --> 03:43:27.685
TALIESIN: Where have I got my bonus actions?
Just for fun, let's give him some more bees.

03:43:27.685 --> 03:43:33.719
(knocking) Wake up again, guys. I'm going
to cast the swarm right in his face.

03:43:33.719 --> 03:43:35.573
MATT: Isn't that once per long rest, though?

03:43:35.573 --> 03:43:37.706
TALIESIN: We took a long rest since
the last time I used that.

03:43:37.706 --> 03:43:39.412
LAURA: With the-- oh, we did!

03:43:39.412 --> 03:43:42.342
MATT: You did, I believe. That's right.
All righty.

03:43:42.342 --> 03:43:43.948
TALIESIN: It's been a while.

03:43:43.948 --> 03:43:46.198
MATT: The beetles scatter and go--

03:43:46.198 --> 03:43:47.455
TALIESIN: I think it's been a long rest.

03:43:47.455 --> 03:43:49.845
MATT: It has been, yeah. I was thinking of the
kobolds, but no. It was earlier, before that.

03:43:49.845 --> 03:43:51.766
SAM: Your movement's 45?

03:43:51.766 --> 03:43:57.533
TALIESIN: So yeah. That's a swarm of insects
and I think they're going to attack.

03:43:57.533 --> 03:43:58.938
MATT: Go for it.

03:43:58.938 --> 03:44:00.720
SAM: I'll be short 30 feet.

03:44:00.720 --> 03:44:02.028
LAURA: You can go 30 feet?

03:44:02.028 --> 03:44:03.750
SAM: No. I'll be short 30 feet.

03:44:03.750 --> 03:44:07.766
TALIESIN: That's-- oh god, that is terrible.
It's eight, nine, ten, 11. That's 11 to hit?

03:44:07.766 --> 03:44:14.613
MATT: They're attacking the shield, and it's
burning up the beetles because it's a flaming shield.

03:44:14.613 --> 03:44:17.248
TALIESIN: I was going to try to get them
on the face, but--

03:44:17.248 --> 03:44:19.838
MATT: Right. They couldn't quite get there.
There's so much shield for it to get to.

03:44:19.838 --> 03:44:21.744
(sizzling)

03:44:21.744 --> 03:44:23.579
TRAVIS: Yeah, just popping.

03:44:23.579 --> 03:44:29.238
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm going to pop back in
all the way as far as I can, against the wall.

03:44:29.238 --> 03:44:31.813
MATT: You popped out and-- this is
the wall here. This is a tunnel.

03:44:31.813 --> 03:44:33.527
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Yeah.

03:44:33.527 --> 03:44:42.678
MATT: For better appearance here.
There, that's the tunnel. All righty.

03:44:42.678 --> 03:44:46.533
That finishes Caduceus' turn.
It is now the fire giants' turn.

03:44:46.533 --> 03:44:47.785
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:44:47.785 --> 03:44:59.487
MATT: Seeing Fjord there. (counting)

03:44:59.487 --> 03:45:01.270
SAM: Oh, that's lava. He can't walk in there.

03:45:01.270 --> 03:45:04.798
LAURA: He is going straight through the lava?
But there's a bridge!

03:45:04.798 --> 03:45:07.153
MARISHA: Fuck bridges.

03:45:07.153 --> 03:45:10.497
MATT: He's going to go ahead-- he doesn't know
if he's going to have enough range for it.

03:45:10.497 --> 03:45:12.561
He's going to attempt his shield charge.

03:45:12.561 --> 03:45:14.973
SAM: Shield charge.

03:45:14.973 --> 03:45:25.532
MATT: No, actually. It's going to instead
cruise up 30 up to that point and

03:45:25.532 --> 03:45:30.950
it's going to grab a rock off the ground
and chuck it straight at you, Fjord.

03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:32.578
TRAVIS: Like a rock, or like a rock?

03:45:32.578 --> 03:45:34.653
MATT: Like a rock. It's about
the size of your torso.

03:45:34.653 --> 03:45:35.821
TRAVIS: Just wanted to check.

03:45:35.821 --> 03:45:38.080
MATT: It reaches off the side, and it's been
sitting next to the lava and it's actually

03:45:38.080 --> 03:45:41.787
orange on one side from the nearby heat.
Picks it up-- drops the shield

03:45:41.787 --> 03:45:45.367
for a second, picks it up and (swoosh)
lobs it right towards you.

03:45:45.367 --> 03:45:47.105
LIAM: Princess Bride moment.

03:45:47.105 --> 03:45:52.953
MATT: Oh, that's going to be 32 to hit.

03:45:52.953 --> 03:45:53.965
SAM: To hit?

03:45:53.965 --> 03:45:54.825
MATT: Yeah.

03:45:54.825 --> 03:45:55.700
LIAM: Holy shit.

03:45:55.700 --> 03:45:56.800
TRAVIS: Oh no.

03:45:56.800 --> 03:45:57.731
SAM: Miss.

03:45:57.731 --> 03:46:00.624
TRAVIS: (explosion) Fjord just explodes.

03:46:00.624 --> 03:46:02.080
LIAM: Just powder.

03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:04.519
TRAVIS: The second splat on the fucking ground.

03:46:04.519 --> 03:46:08.266
MATT: You can't tell where Fjord ends
and Spurt begins.

03:46:08.266 --> 03:46:10.726
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. That definitely hits.

03:46:10.726 --> 03:46:15.528
MATT: Oh, fuck. All right, that is 34
points of bludgeoning damage.

03:46:15.528 --> 03:46:16.975
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:46:16.975 --> 03:46:18.450
MATT: I need you to make a concentration check.

03:46:18.450 --> 03:46:20.099
MARISHA and LAURA: What?

03:46:20.099 --> 03:46:21.711
MATT: Because you are currently
holding your spell.

03:46:21.711 --> 03:46:22.716
SAM: Polymorph.

03:46:22.716 --> 03:46:27.782
MATT: No, not Polymorph. He's holding-- like,
when you begin casting your Thunder Step.

03:46:27.782 --> 03:46:31.261
TRAVIS: Constitution check or saving throw?

03:46:31.261 --> 03:46:37.504
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, and you
have to have half of 34, that puts it at 17.

03:46:37.504 --> 03:46:41.383
The DC of 17 you have to beat
to maintain concentration.

03:46:41.383 --> 03:46:50.150
TRAVIS: 20. That was going to be a
plan ruiner for the second time.

03:46:50.150 --> 03:46:54.386
MATT: The boulder slams into you and for a
minute your lights just go white.

03:46:54.386 --> 03:47:00.708
Your eyes go to complete and utter absence
of image; just the color white. The pain

03:47:00.708 --> 03:47:05.803
streaks through you. You can feel the burning
scrape of when it impacted your forehead,

03:47:05.803 --> 03:47:09.097
and as soon as you right yourself, you look
down and the spell begins to fade from your

03:47:09.097 --> 03:47:13.160
fingertips, and you just barely hold on to it.
It's like rocketing in your hands.

03:47:13.160 --> 03:47:16.580
You can see the energy and the thunderous
power beginning to build in your palm.

03:47:16.580 --> 03:47:20.977
That finishes that giant's turn.
The cow's going to move.

03:47:20.977 --> 03:47:24.495
SAM and LIAM: It's going to moo-ve?

03:47:24.495 --> 03:47:29.571
MATT: Oh god. All right, I don't have
movement for a cow here.

03:47:29.571 --> 03:47:31.559
SAM: Probably 15 feet?

03:47:31.559 --> 03:47:33.272
TRAVIS: Bison, Buffalo?

03:47:33.272 --> 03:47:36.370
LIAM: "Speed 40 feet" is what the internet
is telling me.

03:47:36.370 --> 03:47:37.584
MARISHA: No way.

03:47:37.584 --> 03:47:40.149
SAM: Cows can--? I mean, they're fast.
They have four legs.

03:47:40.149 --> 03:47:41.380
MATT: Yeah, dude, they can move.

03:47:41.380 --> 03:47:42.377
TRAVIS: (mooing)

03:47:42.377 --> 03:47:46.190
MATT: Hold on. Cow. There it is:
"Large beast, 30 feet"

03:47:46.190 --> 03:47:48.412
SAM: (singing) What does the cow say?

03:47:48.412 --> 03:47:52.389
MATT and TRAVIS: (counting)

03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:53.579
TRAVIS: Jesus.

03:47:53.579 --> 03:47:55.766
MATT: The cow's going to go ahead
and attempt to attack you.

03:47:55.766 --> 03:47:59.010
LIAM: Just let it happen. Just let it happen.

03:47:59.010 --> 03:48:02.362
TRAVIS: (ramming) Bitch slap a cow.

03:48:02.362 --> 03:48:03.716
MATT: 21 to hit. What's your armor class?

03:48:03.716 --> 03:48:05.075
TRAVIS: That hits.

03:48:05.075 --> 03:48:06.866
LAURA: The cow gets you?

03:48:06.866 --> 03:48:08.106
SAM: With what?

03:48:08.106 --> 03:48:09.675
TRAVIS: They got big-ass teeth.

03:48:09.675 --> 03:48:14.238
MATT: You take eight points of piercing
damage as the cow gores you with its horn.

03:48:14.238 --> 03:48:17.293
I need you to make another constitution
saving throw.

03:48:17.293 --> 03:48:20.550
TRAVIS: Another constitution saving throw?

03:48:20.550 --> 03:48:22.568
MATT: Correct. It's DC ten.

03:48:22.568 --> 03:48:25.913
TRAVIS: Okay, all right. Come on, come on.
Natural 20.

03:48:25.913 --> 03:48:28.972
MATT: Oh my god! Damn it.

03:48:28.972 --> 03:48:31.980
LIAM: Take 30 points of cow damage.

03:48:31.980 --> 03:48:35.259
TRAVIS: Next time, you specify dairy cow.

03:48:35.259 --> 03:48:37.078
MARISHA: This has been too much.

03:48:37.078 --> 03:48:38.727
MATT: Yasha's turn.

03:48:38.727 --> 03:48:47.279
TRAVIS: Yasha will use 40 feet of movement to run
past the cow to come into contact with Fjord.

03:48:47.279 --> 03:48:50.306
SAM: Does the cow get an attack of cow-portunity?

03:48:50.306 --> 03:48:54.123
TALIESIN: The cow is going to probably
turn back into a giant when they move.

03:48:54.123 --> 03:48:57.685
MATT: She just barely makes it around with
her 40 feet of movement to get to you,

03:48:57.685 --> 03:49:00.723
the cow now blocking that space that she
was going to run through.

03:49:00.723 --> 03:49:02.314
TRAVIS: Does the cow get an attack of
opportunity?

03:49:02.314 --> 03:49:04.137
MATT: No, she hasn't left the cow's melee range.

03:49:04.137 --> 03:49:05.230
TRAVIS: I understand.

03:49:05.230 --> 03:49:07.172
MATT: Yasha runs up to you and--

03:49:07.172 --> 03:49:10.725
TRAVIS: Fjord summons the falchion and
stabs it into the ground casting

03:49:10.725 --> 03:49:13.961
Thunder Step and will go 90 feet
in the direction of the tunnel.

03:49:13.961 --> 03:49:17.746
MARISHA: How many times have we said cow
in the past 30 seconds?

03:49:17.746 --> 03:49:21.875
MATT: Yeah, you guys appear already
in the tunnel across the way.

03:49:21.875 --> 03:49:23.346
SAM: That didn't damage the cow at all,
did it?

03:49:23.346 --> 03:49:26.491
MATT: It does.

03:49:26.491 --> 03:49:30.797
TRAVIS: It does. It does 3d10
thunder damage.

03:49:30.797 --> 03:49:32.250
LAURA: Low damage to the cow.

03:49:32.250 --> 03:49:33.587
TRAVIS: I forgot about that.

03:49:33.587 --> 03:49:35.531
LAURA: Roll three ones, three ones.

03:49:35.531 --> 03:49:40.065
TRAVIS: (counting) 20 points
of thunder damage.

03:49:40.065 --> 03:49:41.559
MATT: Is there a save?

03:49:41.559 --> 03:49:45.741
MARISHA: Is the cow super dexy?

03:49:45.741 --> 03:49:47.321
TRAVIS: Constitution 16.

03:49:47.321 --> 03:49:49.572
SAM and MARISHA: Cow-stitution.

03:49:49.572 --> 03:49:51.438
MATT: 13, fail. Takes 20 damage.

03:49:51.438 --> 03:49:53.709
TRAVIS: Actually, it takes 22 damage.

03:49:53.709 --> 03:49:54.823
MATT: (poof)

03:49:54.823 --> 03:49:56.726
LAURA and TALIESIN: No!

03:49:56.726 --> 03:50:00.343
MATT: The cow form is sundered as the
thunder blast destroys its Polymorph form

03:50:00.343 --> 03:50:06.536
and then, (grunt) emerging from it: the
second fire giant, pissed off, <i>real</i> angry.

03:50:06.536 --> 03:50:10.460
But that does carry over seven points
of thunder damage to the fire giant.

03:50:10.460 --> 03:50:12.327
TRAVIS: Hey! All right.

03:50:12.327 --> 03:50:14.423
MARISHA: What did we do?

03:50:14.423 --> 03:50:16.561
MATT: All right, that finishes Yasha's turn.
Nott, you're up.

03:50:16.561 --> 03:50:18.605
SAM: What the fuck?

03:50:18.605 --> 03:50:22.231
MARISHA: Nott's the only one!

03:50:22.231 --> 03:50:24.349
TRAVIS: Super invisible, right?

03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:25.650
LAURA: You're invisible.

03:50:25.650 --> 03:50:26.304
SAM: Yeah.

03:50:26.304 --> 03:50:27.868
LAURA: And I blessed you.

03:50:27.868 --> 03:50:29.330
SAM: Sure, what does that do again?

03:50:29.330 --> 03:50:30.862
LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth.

03:50:30.862 --> 03:50:33.455
LIAM: That just means you're going to Bilbo Baggins
your way across this bridge, motherfucker!

03:50:33.455 --> 03:50:35.450
LAURA and TRAVIS: Take your time.

03:50:35.450 --> 03:50:36.970
SAM: Okay, I will stealthily--

03:50:36.970 --> 03:50:38.139
LAURA: How long can you stay invisible?

03:50:38.139 --> 03:50:40.026
SAM: One minute. I will stealthily emerge--

03:50:40.026 --> 03:50:41.609
MATT: So you've already cast Invisibility
on yourself?

03:50:41.609 --> 03:50:43.955
SAM: Yes. It's probably been one round now.

03:50:43.955 --> 03:50:45.365
MATT: There you go.

03:50:45.365 --> 03:50:48.016
MARISHA: You have to get across that
bridge, right? There is no other way?

03:50:48.016 --> 03:50:51.972
MATT: Your speed is now 35, because
you took the halfling feat.

03:50:51.972 --> 03:50:56.969
SAM: Correct. I will stealthily make
my way to the bridge, around the--

03:50:56.969 --> 03:51:05.878
MATT: So if you're moving at full speed--
the stealth rules, looking this up right here.

03:51:05.878 --> 03:51:13.562
As you're invisible, "Impossible to see-- 
The creature's location can be detected by

03:51:13.562 --> 03:51:16.611
"any noise it makes, tracks it leaves--"
So still means stealth check, but you have

03:51:16.611 --> 03:51:20.058
advantage on the stealth check. I believe
if you're moving your full speed

03:51:20.058 --> 03:51:23.935
it's disadvantage on stealth?
I'm trying to remember.

03:51:23.935 --> 03:51:28.007
LAURA: But with Blessing of the Trickster it might
be balanced out, because you get advantage on--

03:51:28.007 --> 03:51:30.908
MATT: If you have disadvantage and advantage
it just cancels out, no matter how much you

03:51:30.908 --> 03:51:34.398
have of each. So it would be just a straight
roll. I'll put it there. That's fine.

03:51:34.398 --> 03:51:37.529
So go ahead and make a stealth check.

03:51:37.529 --> 03:51:51.632
SAM: 15. Not great. Oh wait, I also get-- I have
the hood, the cloak, but it's all canceled out.

03:51:51.632 --> 03:52:02.479
MATT: It all cancels out. So (counting) that's
your movement. As you come through quietly,

03:52:02.479 --> 03:52:11.161
the giant who just appeared goes-- and looks over.
Passive perceptions are 15 and 16. Both giants

03:52:11.161 --> 03:52:15.597
look, and they see footsteps and they're both
like, (grunts). They still don't know-- they know

03:52:15.597 --> 03:52:18.227
the general vicinity where you are. Anything
against you still has disadvantage,

03:52:18.227 --> 03:52:21.573
but it's still your turn. You still have
your bonus action and your attack.

03:52:21.573 --> 03:52:23.893
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I'll just kill them both.

03:52:23.893 --> 03:52:25.491
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

03:52:25.491 --> 03:52:30.745
SAM: I can use an action to dash?

03:52:30.745 --> 03:52:31.694
MATT: Yeah.

03:52:31.694 --> 03:52:38.101
SAM: Okay. I'll action dash, but not up the
bridge. Around the side closest to me.

03:52:38.101 --> 03:52:39.259
MATT: This way?

03:52:39.259 --> 03:52:40.419
SAM: Uh-huh.

03:52:40.419 --> 03:52:45.541
MATT: All right. So five, ten. As soon as the
footsteps are happening, it makes an attack

03:52:45.541 --> 03:52:48.663
of opportunity in your general direction.
It has disadvantage on the attack.

03:52:48.663 --> 03:52:50.002
SAM: Sure. Yeah.

03:52:50.002 --> 03:52:57.488
MATT: So for this here-- this is with
its giant maul. That is a 20 to hit.

03:52:57.713 --> 03:52:59.339
SAM: Sure, that hits.

03:52:59.745 --> 03:53:09.857
MATT: Okay. So it's a giant hammer that's
large enough that sweeps through the

03:53:09.927 --> 03:53:14.610
general area and catches you in the back.
You take--

03:53:14.610 --> 03:53:16.475
TALIESIN: Oh, wow. That's a lot of rolling.

03:53:16.475 --> 03:53:18.186
LAURA: Does that drop your invisibility
once you're hit?

03:53:18.186 --> 03:53:19.863
SAM: Oh, yeah. I think so.

03:53:19.863 --> 03:53:21.619
LIAM: Don't kill my goblin, Matthew.

03:53:21.619 --> 03:53:23.677
MATT: 28 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:53:23.677 --> 03:53:26.121
SAM: I'll do whatever you call it to halve that.

03:53:26.121 --> 03:53:29.322
MATT: Okay, so you use your reaction, so
that makes it a 14. Go ahead and make a

03:53:29.322 --> 03:53:32.910
constitution saving throw, DC ten, to try and
maintain concentration on Invisibility.

03:53:32.910 --> 03:53:34.811
SAM: Oh, it doesn't just automatically drop?

03:53:34.811 --> 03:53:37.720
MATT: No.

03:53:37.720 --> 03:53:40.335
SAM: What kind of check?

03:53:40.335 --> 03:53:41.843
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

03:53:41.843 --> 03:53:43.221
SAM: Ten.

03:53:43.221 --> 03:53:45.615
MATT: You just barely maintain concentration.
That was the base DC.

03:53:45.615 --> 03:53:47.049
TRAVIS: You maintain?

03:53:47.049 --> 03:53:49.728
LAURA: Yeah, she's still invisible.

03:53:49.888 --> 03:53:52.994
MATT: 15, 20, 25. You still have ten more
feet of movement there.

03:53:52.994 --> 03:53:55.110
SAM: Under the bridge.

03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:56.968
MATT: Okay.

03:53:56.968 --> 03:54:02.519
SAM: And-- (pained screaming)
I'm coming for you, Spurt!

03:54:02.519 --> 03:54:05.720
MATT: You're under the bridge now.

03:54:05.720 --> 03:54:10.941
SAM: And then I will press my body to
the bridge and bonus action just hide.

03:54:10.941 --> 03:54:14.574
MATT: Go for it. Go ahead and make a
stealth check. This is with advantage.

03:54:14.574 --> 03:54:19.334
SAM: Thank jesus! Terrible.
This is stealth?

03:54:19.461 --> 03:54:20.679
MATT: Yes.

03:54:20.679 --> 03:54:21.927
SAM: 18.

03:54:21.927 --> 03:54:23.986
MATT: 18. Okay.

03:54:23.986 --> 03:54:26.556
TRAVIS: Just wait, just wait. Don't do anything yet.

03:54:26.556 --> 03:54:30.665
MATT: They both saw where you went, but they
don't know exactly where you are.

03:54:30.665 --> 03:54:35.345
That finishes your turn. Caleb, you're up,
if you want to do anything.

03:54:35.345 --> 03:54:42.142
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I'm going to lean out. I'm going
to extend my middle finger to the giant

03:54:42.238 --> 03:54:48.940
on the bridge, mutter a few arcane words
around my hand, and cast Banishment.

03:54:48.940 --> 03:54:52.304
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

03:54:52.304 --> 03:54:57.606
LIAM: 16 charisma. Components are an item
distasteful to the target.

03:54:57.606 --> 03:55:02.932
MATT: Gotcha. Natural 19 plus five. I'm rolling
really fucking good for these guys.

03:55:02.932 --> 03:55:04.761
SAM: Good, that's good.

03:55:04.778 --> 03:55:05.837
MATT: That is ridiculous.

03:55:05.963 --> 03:55:07.520
LAURA: Big fire giants, they are really--

03:55:07.520 --> 03:55:09.065
MATT: They are. That's a plus five--

03:55:09.065 --> 03:55:10.683
TRAVIS: This is vengeance for
the traffic cone guys.

03:55:10.683 --> 03:55:11.966
MATT: There you go.

03:55:12.019 --> 03:55:17.702
LIAM: So for my movement, I am going to just
take a step, not back in, but to the side.

03:55:17.702 --> 03:55:19.315
MATT: There?

03:55:19.315 --> 03:55:22.153
LIAM: Actually, and I will walk--
To the other side of the dog.

03:55:22.153 --> 03:55:23.668
MATT: There?

03:55:23.668 --> 03:55:25.041
LIAM: Yeah, right there.

03:55:25.041 --> 03:55:26.871
MATT: All right. Okay. Is that your turn?

03:55:26.942 --> 03:55:29.034
LIAM: Yeah. And I'm just looking for Nott.

03:55:29.034 --> 03:55:34.452
MATT: You got it. That finishes your go, to the
top. Beau, anything? Are you staying put?

03:55:34.452 --> 03:55:40.631
MARISHA: I am going to peek around
the corner. And I'm going to hold

03:55:40.631 --> 03:55:50.737
my action to run and grab Nott,
if I see her.

03:55:50.737 --> 03:55:52.136
MATT: To what? To--

03:55:52.136 --> 03:55:53.798
MARISHA: To run and grab Nott,
if I see her.

03:55:53.798 --> 03:55:56.061
MATT: Okay, you got it.
That's your action.

03:55:56.061 --> 03:55:57.541
MARISHA: I'll hold, though.

03:55:57.541 --> 03:55:59.368
MATT: Jester, your turn.
You doing anything?

03:55:59.368 --> 03:56:02.668
LAURA: Sure. Yes, I am going to.

03:56:02.668 --> 03:56:05.109
MATT: You're back in the tunnels, so you
have to move out to really get a good view.

03:56:05.109 --> 03:56:08.455
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to just pop my head
and out and see what's happening.

03:56:08.455 --> 03:56:09.903
MATT: All right.

03:56:09.903 --> 03:56:17.116
LAURA: And I'm going to cast... Jesus.

03:56:17.116 --> 03:56:19.194
MATT: Fjord, you're on deck.

03:56:19.194 --> 03:56:20.891
SAM: Cast Jesus.

03:56:20.891 --> 03:56:29.628
LAURA: Fuck. Okay I'm not concentrating
anymore. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

03:56:29.628 --> 03:56:33.107
MATT: Okay. Where are you placing your—

03:56:33.107 --> 03:56:37.151
LAURA: I'm going to send my duplicate
30 feet in front of me.

03:56:37.151 --> 03:56:39.787
MATT: Right there.

03:56:39.787 --> 03:56:48.776
LAURA: And then I'm going to make her run out and
leap over the lava and land on the other side.

03:56:48.776 --> 03:56:53.095
MATT: As it is an illusory duplicate,
it does not need to make a check.

03:56:53.095 --> 03:56:55.276
It just appears to leap and land.

03:56:55.276 --> 03:56:57.681
LAURA: And then she's going to act like
she's readying for the fight

03:56:57.681 --> 03:56:59.655
and getting ready to cast something.

03:56:59.655 --> 03:57:03.883
MATT: Okay. I will say, make
a deception check.

03:57:03.883 --> 03:57:06.271
LAURA: Okay.

03:57:06.271 --> 03:57:09.501
LIAM: Come on, La. Come on.

03:57:09.501 --> 03:57:16.881
LAURA: God fucking dammit. Seven.

03:57:16.881 --> 03:57:19.870
MATT: Okay.

03:57:19.870 --> 03:57:21.599
SAM: I think it worked.

03:57:21.599 --> 03:57:23.087
MATT: That finishes your turn, Jester.

03:57:23.087 --> 03:57:24.866
SAM: Our deceptions are so deceptive.

03:57:24.866 --> 03:57:26.378
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

03:57:26.378 --> 03:57:29.088
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't want to draw
any more attention to the cave,

03:57:29.088 --> 03:57:31.150
because that's where he's got to go.

03:57:31.150 --> 03:57:32.896
SAM: Do not. They haven't found me yet.

03:57:32.896 --> 03:57:36.293
TRAVIS: I'm going to do nothing.
That's my turn.

03:57:36.293 --> 03:57:39.602
MATT: All righty. Caduceus.

03:57:39.602 --> 03:57:47.892
TALIESIN: I am definitely not 30 feet away
from that big mo with the--

03:57:47.892 --> 03:57:49.676
MATT: Nope.

03:57:49.676 --> 03:57:51.778
TALIESIN: I would have to get way out
there to be 30 feet.

03:57:51.778 --> 03:57:53.629
MATT: You would have to get a lot closer
than you are, yes.

03:57:53.629 --> 03:57:56.047
TALIESIN: I am 60 feet away from Nott,
however, correct?

03:57:56.047 --> 03:58:00.369
MATT: You are actually further than
60 feet from Nott.

03:58:00.369 --> 03:58:03.053
TALIESIN: But getting 60 feet
from Nott is not--

03:58:03.053 --> 03:58:06.537
MATT: Not too bad. You can move 15 feet
and get pretty close.

03:58:06.537 --> 03:58:07.914
TALIESIN: And then hop back in.

03:58:07.914 --> 03:58:10.263
MATT: You could do that, yes.

03:58:10.263 --> 03:58:13.130
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to
hop out and--

03:58:13.130 --> 03:58:14.894
LAURA: You don't know where Nott went.

03:58:14.894 --> 03:58:16.694
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. I don't know
where Nott is, do I?

03:58:16.694 --> 03:58:19.940
MATT: Yeah. You walk out and go--
And don't see Nott.

03:58:19.940 --> 03:58:22.039
TALIESIN: Then I would have just...

03:58:22.039 --> 03:58:24.490
TRAVIS: You going to join me
on the nope train?

03:58:24.490 --> 03:58:26.364
TALIESIN: I'm going to be
on the nope train.

03:58:26.364 --> 03:58:28.062
MATT: All right, do you move back in?

03:58:28.062 --> 03:58:29.649
TALIESIN: Yeah. In fact, if anything--

03:58:29.649 --> 03:58:32.006
LAURA: You could prep a healing for
when you see Nott.

03:58:32.006 --> 03:58:34.366
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to hold
a healing spell for--

03:58:34.366 --> 03:58:36.256
MATT: What spell?

03:58:36.256 --> 03:58:38.878
TALIESIN: Oh, just Cure Wounds.
Just the bonus action one.

03:58:38.878 --> 03:58:48.227
MATT: You got it. Okay, now it's their turn.
The dreadnaught is going to step off there

03:58:48.227 --> 03:58:52.620
and use its shield charge against the bridge.

03:58:52.792 --> 03:58:58.164
Stepping forward and slamming
into the stone there.

03:58:58.319 --> 03:59:01.486
TRAVIS: But my fake manticore is
still flying around!

03:59:01.530 --> 03:59:04.408
MATT: It is. And there's a lot of people
really confused out by that citadel.

03:59:04.408 --> 03:59:06.515
SAM: (screeching)

03:59:06.515 --> 03:59:09.785
TRAVIS: Whatever that citadel is.
We should go attack the citadel.

03:59:09.785 --> 03:59:12.906
MATT: Ooh.

03:59:12.906 --> 03:59:16.084
LIAM: Fuck our culture.

03:59:16.084 --> 03:59:22.335
MATT: The whole bridge comes crashing down.

03:59:22.335 --> 03:59:24.207
LIAM: Oh, man.

03:59:24.207 --> 03:59:28.162
MATT: Into the lava there. This bridge part
collapses. Nott, I need you to make

03:59:28.162 --> 03:59:29.973
a dexterity check. Or saving throw, please.

03:59:30.107 --> 03:59:32.049
LAURA: Saving throw.

03:59:32.049 --> 03:59:34.026
SAM: 19.

03:59:34.026 --> 03:59:38.389
MATT: 19. You avoid some of the damage.
You manage to just skitter out of the way.

03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:45.810
So you take half. That puts you at, it would be
14 down to 7 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:59:45.810 --> 03:59:49.252
LAURA: If she would have rolled a one,
would she be in the lava?

03:59:49.252 --> 03:59:57.679
MATT: Yeah. So pushes into this area, knocks
the bridge over, continues the movement

03:59:57.679 --> 04:00:04.151
into that point there. This one here is
going to go ahead and move forward.

04:00:04.151 --> 04:00:08.655
SAM: Do I have to make a concentration check?

04:00:08.655 --> 04:00:10.578
MATT: You do, yes.

04:00:10.578 --> 04:00:12.441
SAM: 18.

04:00:12.441 --> 04:00:19.821
MATT: You're fine. And it's going to use its action
try to perceive you. It has no idea where you are.

04:00:19.941 --> 04:00:25.987
That is total-- you rolled an 18, right?

04:00:25.987 --> 04:00:27.664
SAM: I believe so.

04:00:27.664 --> 04:00:29.586
MATT: Still cannot see you.

04:00:29.586 --> 04:00:31.920
TRAVIS: What's your jumping distance?

04:00:31.920 --> 04:00:33.798
MATT: All right. Yasha's turn. Anything?

04:00:33.798 --> 04:00:35.856
TRAVIS: Negative. Nope train.

04:00:35.983 --> 04:00:38.024
MATT: Yasha's staying put.
Nott, your turn.

04:00:38.024 --> 04:00:43.621
SAM: I close my eyes and imagine my beautiful
husband waiting for me, needing me,

04:00:43.621 --> 04:00:47.074
and I run across the lava.

04:00:47.074 --> 04:00:48.650
LAURA: No.

04:00:48.650 --> 04:00:50.689
SAM: With my ring of water walking.

04:00:50.689 --> 04:00:58.240
MATT: Okay. You can do it. You can.
You run across. (burning)

04:00:58.240 --> 04:01:01.770
SAM: Not right at the giant.
I'll go around in a--

04:01:01.770 --> 04:01:04.101
LAURA: Can you leap on the
crumbled bridge parts?

04:01:04.101 --> 04:01:05.723
SAM: Sure, I'll try to leap on some rocks.

04:01:05.723 --> 04:01:08.572
MATT: It's up to you. Are you going to
try and leap across?

04:01:08.572 --> 04:01:10.685
SAM: Are there chunks in the water?

04:01:10.685 --> 04:01:14.003
MATT: Yes, there is one chunk here that is
splashing and hasn't sunken in yet.

04:01:14.003 --> 04:01:16.176
SAM: All right. I'll do that.

04:01:16.176 --> 04:01:19.226
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an
athletics check, we'll say, just to try and--

04:01:19.226 --> 04:01:20.949
SAM: Just a check?

04:01:20.949 --> 04:01:22.371
MATT: Yep.

04:01:22.371 --> 04:01:25.199
SAM: Ten.

04:01:25.371 --> 04:01:30.625
MATT: That's fine. That's the base you needed.
(swish) Making it across this way. As you rush

04:01:30.625 --> 04:01:35.464
across, though, the movement catches its
attention. It gets an attack of opportunity

04:01:35.464 --> 04:01:45.060
on you. However, it's at disadvantage on
the attack. So that would be 17 to hit.

04:01:45.060 --> 04:01:48.501
SAM: My armor class, as of today, is 18.

04:01:48.501 --> 04:01:52.824
TRAVIS: Because of the level up?

04:01:52.824 --> 04:01:54.487
SAM: Yeah.

04:01:54.487 --> 04:01:56.480
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

04:01:56.480 --> 04:02:02.057
MATT: As soon as you rush up and leap in the air,
it sees the push off of rocks and backhands with

04:02:02.057 --> 04:02:08.328
the hammer, and as it swings out you pull your
legs up and it just barely (swoosh) misses from

04:02:08.328 --> 04:02:12.908
beneath your feet as you tuck them closer to
your chest and land on that rock piece there.

04:02:12.908 --> 04:02:17.549
So that's (counting). You can attempt
one more jump.

04:02:17.549 --> 04:02:19.439
SAM: Absolutely.

04:02:19.439 --> 04:02:20.939
MATT: Athletics check.

04:02:20.939 --> 04:02:24.260
SAM: Less. It's nine.

04:02:24.260 --> 04:02:30.629
MATT: Nine. (burning sound) So the good
news is you don't (splash) into it,

04:02:30.629 --> 04:02:36.810
because lava doesn't really work that way.
However, it's a lot of fire damage.

04:02:36.810 --> 04:02:42.220
Yeah, I'm trying to remember
where that is.

04:02:42.220 --> 04:02:46.087
TALIESIN: You get to keep
moving though, right?

04:02:46.087 --> 04:02:48.591
LIAM: This is what happened the last time
we went to the Underdark.

04:02:48.591 --> 04:02:50.345
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah!

04:02:50.345 --> 04:02:51.263
MATT: Yeah, it is.

04:02:51.263 --> 04:02:53.732
TALIESIN: Man, you had to regrow a leg.

04:02:53.732 --> 04:02:55.195
MATT: That's right!

04:02:55.195 --> 04:02:57.098
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's going to
happen again!

04:02:57.098 --> 04:03:00.882
MATT: Okay, pardon me here--

04:03:00.882 --> 04:03:03.174
TRAVIS: What is that citadel?

04:03:03.174 --> 04:03:08.402
LIAM: It's just where these people
live, man.

04:03:08.402 --> 04:03:10.447
MATT: It's not in that book.

04:03:10.447 --> 04:03:12.319
SAM: Other beautiful book.

04:03:12.319 --> 04:03:14.095
LIAM: But they are really gorgeous
to look at.

04:03:14.095 --> 04:03:16.369
SAM: Chris Perkins, ladies and gentlemen.

04:03:16.369 --> 04:03:18.880
LIAM: Yeah, hats off. Great books.

04:03:18.880 --> 04:03:21.671
SAM: Book designer. Lead book designer.

04:03:21.671 --> 04:03:24.303
LAURA: Lava fire damage is what
you're looking up right now?

04:03:24.303 --> 04:03:28.280
MATT: Yeah, it's all good.
Thank you, Google.

04:03:28.280 --> 04:03:30.881
LAURA: I remember this being
ludicrously horrible.

04:03:30.881 --> 04:03:32.780
MATT: It's pretty bad. It's pretty bad.

04:03:32.780 --> 04:03:34.361
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine.

04:03:34.361 --> 04:03:37.550
LIAM: It took several days of Pike
giving me good mojo to heal.

04:03:37.550 --> 04:03:39.813
LAURA: And that was before we
did the full lava damage.

04:03:39.813 --> 04:03:42.460
MATT: On page 249 of the
Dungeon Master's Guide.

04:03:42.460 --> 04:03:43.806
LIAM: Holy shite.

04:03:43.806 --> 04:03:45.267
SAM: Did Chris just say that?

04:03:45.267 --> 04:03:46.603
LAURA: Yeah.

04:03:46.603 --> 04:03:48.095
MATT: Bless you.

04:03:48.095 --> 04:03:51.093
TALIESIN: Monster! I got a plan.

04:03:51.093 --> 04:03:53.268
LAURA: I got a better plan.

04:03:53.268 --> 04:03:56.304
TALIESIN: I got a plan. Everything's
going to be fine.

04:03:56.304 --> 04:03:57.807
SAM: Sure.

04:03:57.807 --> 04:03:59.348
TALIESIN: I got a plan.

04:03:59.348 --> 04:04:01.248
LAURA: Do you have the ability
to roll back time?

04:04:01.248 --> 04:04:02.704
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:04:02.704 --> 04:04:05.168
TRAVIS: (singing) If I could turn back time.

04:04:05.168 --> 04:04:10.413
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (singing) If I could
find a way.

04:04:10.572 --> 04:04:18.664
MATT: All right. Your foot hits the edge
and just skips. You fall back and land

04:04:18.664 --> 04:04:25.238
and hit the lava on your back and legs.
The ring keeps you from sinking into it,

04:04:25.238 --> 04:04:29.937
so I'm not giving you full submerged
damage, so you don't take the full 18d10.

04:04:29.937 --> 04:04:36.341
(shocked screaming)

04:04:36.341 --> 04:04:38.795
LIAM: Don't you take my goblin mom away!

04:04:38.863 --> 04:04:40.686
TRAVIS: 9d10?

04:04:40.686 --> 04:04:42.768
MARISHA: Yeah, is that 9d10?

04:04:42.768 --> 04:04:44.171
MATT: It is.

04:04:44.171 --> 04:04:45.993
TRAVIS: (chanting) Ones! Ones!

04:04:45.993 --> 04:04:48.397
SAM: If he rolls a one on all of them,
I'll be okay.

04:04:48.397 --> 04:04:52.289
MARISHA: Are you full health?

04:04:52.289 --> 04:04:53.819
TALIESIN: No.

04:04:53.819 --> 04:04:55.659
LIAM: It's going to be around 45.

04:04:55.659 --> 04:04:57.431
MARISHA: Because you got baseball-batted.

04:04:57.431 --> 04:04:59.021
TRAVIS: He's counting.

04:04:59.021 --> 04:05:00.516
LIAM: What's your full HP?

04:05:00.516 --> 04:05:01.935
SAM: I'm not at full HP.

04:05:01.935 --> 04:05:03.757
LIAM: Oh shit. It's got to be low then
to survive that.

04:05:03.757 --> 04:05:08.056
MATT: 48 points of fire damage.

04:05:08.056 --> 04:05:13.175
SAM: Can I use my whatever it's called--
Uncanny Dodge?

04:05:13.175 --> 04:05:15.540
MATT: It's not an attack.

04:05:15.540 --> 04:05:17.261
SAM: It doesn't work. It's an effect.

04:05:17.261 --> 04:05:19.188
MATT: You can't really dodge the fire.

04:05:19.188 --> 04:05:22.342
TALIESIN: Here's the thing though: I am holding
a healing spell for the second I see him.

04:05:22.342 --> 04:05:25.057
MATT: A Cure Wounds which has to be
up next to him.

04:05:25.057 --> 04:05:26.640
TALIESIN: No, Healing Word. I'm so sorry--

04:05:26.640 --> 04:05:28.076
MATT: You said Cure Wounds earlier--

04:05:28.076 --> 04:05:31.314
TALIESIN: I meant the 60 foot because--
I was trying for the 60 foot range. I am so sorry.

04:05:31.314 --> 04:05:35.026
I said the wrong thing because I was not running
out there. I was going for the 60 foot range.

04:05:35.026 --> 04:05:37.599
SAM: He did say, "I'm within 60 feet of Nott."

04:05:37.599 --> 04:05:41.183
MATT: I'll allow it, all right. I need you to make
a constitution saving throw please.

04:05:41.313 --> 04:05:44.421
SAM: I mean, I'm dead, so--

04:05:44.421 --> 04:05:46.301
TRAVIS: You're unconscious.

04:05:46.301 --> 04:05:47.779
SAM: I'm unconscious.

04:05:47.779 --> 04:05:49.598
MATT: Oh, you're unconscious? Oh, okay.

04:05:49.598 --> 04:05:53.771
TALIESIN: So the second I see--

04:05:53.835 --> 04:06:00.703
MATT: The second Nott falls, you see a burst of
fire and Nott's unconscious body is currently in flames.

04:06:00.703 --> 04:06:02.676
TRAVIS and MATT: Becomes visible.

04:06:02.676 --> 04:06:06.665
TALIESIN: The second Nott is visible, I cast
Cure Wounds. I cast Healing Word. I'm so sorry.

04:06:06.665 --> 04:06:08.601
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll that.

04:06:08.601 --> 04:06:10.236
TALIESIN: I don't have to roll it.

04:06:10.236 --> 04:06:12.192
MATT: That's right, because
you are a grave cleric.

04:06:12.192 --> 04:06:13.975
TALIESIN: You are 17 points up.

04:06:13.975 --> 04:06:15.416
SAM: Oh.

04:06:15.416 --> 04:06:17.092
MATT: You're also on fire.

04:06:17.092 --> 04:06:18.962
SAM: Oh great.

04:06:18.962 --> 04:06:24.416
TRAVIS: 18d10? What is the matter
with you, Perkins? Didn't you know

04:06:24.416 --> 04:06:28.807
this moment was coming when you made those
rules?!

04:06:28.807 --> 04:06:29.944
MARISHA: Blame Perkins for everything.

04:06:29.947 --> 04:06:33.180
TRAVIS: I get that lava is dangerous, but fuck!

04:06:33.180 --> 04:06:36.556
LIAM: So what I did last time did not work
so I am going to change tactics

04:06:36.556 --> 04:06:41.304
and I am going to cast instead Polymorph
on the same giant--

04:06:41.304 --> 04:06:43.325
MATT: Okay, on the big one?

04:06:43.325 --> 04:06:44.798
LIAM: Yeah.

04:06:44.798 --> 04:06:46.559
MATT: What are you polymorphing them into?

04:06:46.559 --> 04:06:48.301
LIAM: A giant octopus.

04:06:48.301 --> 04:06:49.945
MATT: Okay. So that is a what?

04:06:49.945 --> 04:06:51.480
LIAM: 16 wisdom.

04:06:51.480 --> 04:06:59.938
MATT: 16 wisdom. That is a 15. The large
giant suddenly turns into a large octopus.

04:06:59.938 --> 04:07:01.973
LIAM: He has a movement of ten.

04:07:02.046 --> 04:07:06.351
MATT: I will say for the purposes of not
having a giant octopus thing,

04:07:06.351 --> 04:07:08.383
we will just use that for now.

04:07:08.383 --> 04:07:10.133
SAM: It's actually pretty close.

04:07:10.133 --> 04:07:15.358
MATT: It's aquatic in nature. It suddenly (wet
impacts) and is now trying to pull itself forward

04:07:15.435 --> 04:07:20.461
on its new cephalopod body.
So that's your action, Caleb.

04:07:20.627 --> 04:07:26.639
LIAM: I'm going to move back into the--
nope. I'm going to stay right there.

04:07:26.639 --> 04:07:29.331
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn.
Beau, you're up.

04:07:29.331 --> 04:07:37.538
MARISHA: I was holding my action to
go run and grab Nott.

04:07:37.538 --> 04:07:44.931
MATT: So as soon as that happened, you would be
(counting) 35. So you move up with your action.

04:07:44.931 --> 04:07:48.243
You haven't grabbed yet. That was
your holding your dash.

04:07:48.243 --> 04:07:50.645
MARISHA: I'm going to grab flaming Nott.

04:07:50.645 --> 04:07:53.831
MATT: So you reached down and the flames
are burning your hand. The heat is causing

04:07:53.831 --> 04:07:59.838
the skin on your face and arms to begin
to bubble from just the sheer intensity

04:07:59.838 --> 04:08:07.135
of it. As you reach down and pull Nott's
flaming body up from the lava, Nott, your

04:08:07.135 --> 04:08:10.709
eyes come open at that moment and you realize
you're on fire, but Beau is holding you.

04:08:10.709 --> 04:08:13.130
SAM: (screams)

04:08:13.130 --> 04:08:15.539
MARISHA: Through the flames. (screams)

04:08:15.539 --> 04:08:17.163
MATT: You're going to go ahead and--?

04:08:17.163 --> 04:08:19.251
MARISHA: Dash back. Step of the wind!

04:08:19.251 --> 04:08:22.365
MATT: Well, you still have a movement and
your bonus so it was just your action to

04:08:22.365 --> 04:08:28.605
pick up-- it's half-speed to drag somebody
with you so you move 20 feet (counting)

04:08:28.605 --> 04:08:35.600
and then you can move (counting)
15 to get Nott into the tunnel.

04:08:35.600 --> 04:08:37.988
MARISHA: And then I stop, drop,
and roll with Nott.

04:08:37.988 --> 04:08:43.280
MATT: Okay. That would be your next turn
because that was all your actions left.

04:08:43.280 --> 04:08:44.464
LIAM: That was a lot.

04:08:44.464 --> 04:08:47.388
TRAVIS: That was amazing. What are you talking
about? We're fine.

04:08:47.388 --> 04:08:53.836
MATT: Jester, your turn. You see Beau suddenly
rush in and drop to the ground and Nott is on fire.

04:08:54.045 --> 04:08:55.673
MARISHA: Are we both on fire or--

04:08:55.673 --> 04:09:00.271
MATT: Nott currently is the only one on fire
but you do take five points of fire damage

04:09:00.271 --> 04:09:03.846
just from the proximity of reaching out
and grabbing Nott's body.

04:09:03.846 --> 04:09:05.554
MARISHA: Sure.

04:09:05.554 --> 04:09:07.139
LAURA: Okay.

04:09:07.139 --> 04:09:10.421
LIAM: Caleb's standing like a doofus because he
didn't want to leave Nott so he's still out there.

04:09:10.421 --> 04:09:14.328
TRAVIS: Kill that fire giant with your duplicity.

04:09:14.328 --> 04:09:21.256
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to run up with my duplicate
and cast Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level.

04:09:21.256 --> 04:09:22.634
TRAVIS: Kick him in the shin.

04:09:22.634 --> 04:09:24.061
LAURA: Just kick him!

04:09:24.061 --> 04:09:25.668
LIAM: Just make him mad.

04:09:25.668 --> 04:09:27.545
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

04:09:27.545 --> 04:09:29.230
MARISHA: Come on! Yes!

04:09:29.230 --> 04:09:30.839
TALIESIN: This is not a bad idea.

04:09:30.839 --> 04:09:32.339
MARISHA: You are their god!

04:09:32.339 --> 04:09:34.247
LIAM: To keep it occupied: the octopus
is going nowhere.

04:09:34.247 --> 04:09:35.464
LAURA: 17 plus eight. 25!

04:09:35.464 --> 04:09:38.688
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

04:09:38.688 --> 04:09:52.954
LAURA: 5d10! Oh! 30?! (counting)
36 points.

04:09:52.954 --> 04:09:57.909
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage. As your
duplicate rushes forward and reaches out and

04:09:57.909 --> 04:10:03.772
grabs the knee right in front of the storming
fire giant. You watch as the surge of divine

04:10:03.772 --> 04:10:08.993
energy goes from a blue to a green to a black
and as it pierces the knee cap and shoots up

04:10:08.993 --> 04:10:16.099
the leg, the giant just howls in extreme pain and
while it was currently focused and reaching down

04:10:16.099 --> 04:10:20.507
for another boulder while watching Beau carry
Nott away, it suddenly drops the rock,

04:10:20.507 --> 04:10:24.988
grabs its hammer, and looks down
at your duplicate, furious.

04:10:24.988 --> 04:10:27.514
LIAM: Ooh, meniscus tear.

04:10:27.514 --> 04:10:32.726
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn, Jester?
Is that your turn?

04:10:32.726 --> 04:10:35.701
LAURA: That's-- yeah. I mean,
that's all I could do.

04:10:35.701 --> 04:10:37.668
MATT: All right, Fjord. Anything?

04:10:37.668 --> 04:10:40.071
LAURA: Or-- no, that was my action.

04:10:40.071 --> 04:10:43.351
TALIESIN: I mean, you could grab Caleb.
I don't know.

04:10:43.491 --> 04:10:47.710
TRAVIS: No, Caleb can walk his happy ass inside.
No, Fjord is doing nothing.

04:10:47.710 --> 04:10:49.690
MARISHA: Let's bounce.

04:10:49.839 --> 04:10:51.690
TRAVIS: Fjord's doing nothing.

04:10:51.690 --> 04:10:54.081
MATT: Nothing? All right. Caduceus?

04:10:54.104 --> 04:10:59.515
LAURA: Heal Nott or put the fire out or something.
You guys can put the fire out on Nott at least.

04:10:59.554 --> 04:11:01.292
SAM: (screams)

04:11:01.292 --> 04:11:03.395
TRAVIS: I thought you put it out? Oh yeah, I will
run over and pat the fire out.

04:11:03.395 --> 04:11:09.745
MATT: Okay, you use your action to put the
fire out on Nott.

04:11:09.745 --> 04:11:13.399
MATT: You're just watching. "You got this."

04:11:13.631 --> 04:11:16.562
TRAVIS: Yeah. You good?

04:11:16.562 --> 04:11:18.193
MARISHA: Looks fine to me.

04:11:18.193 --> 04:11:19.735
TALIESIN: I'm holding Stone Shape.

04:11:19.735 --> 04:11:22.677
MATT: You got it. That brings us to their turn.
This one is going to--

04:11:23.376 --> 04:11:25.023
LIAM: Ten feet of movement!

04:11:25.023 --> 04:11:28.504
MATT: No, just up there and then dashes.

04:11:28.504 --> 04:11:30.662
LIAM: What? Okay.

04:11:30.662 --> 04:11:35.792
MATT: It's still not in range but it's
curling over the ruins of the bridge.

04:11:35.792 --> 04:11:45.047
Your blink dog gets into your space there.
Now at the end of Polymorph,

04:11:45.047 --> 04:11:47.898
it doesn't get a saving throw, right?
I don't believe.

04:11:47.898 --> 04:11:50.951
LIAM: I don't think so. It's just that unless it
gets hit.

04:11:51.099 --> 04:11:56.332
MATT: Yeah, that's what I thought it was.
Okay. All righty.

04:11:56.332 --> 04:12:02.441
LIAM: Lasts for the duration or until
the target drops to zero hit points--

04:12:02.441 --> 04:12:08.159
MATT: Right, it's just concentration. That's
right. Cool. The other fire giant is going to--

04:12:08.159 --> 04:12:14.283
it does not discern that this is an illusion and
just spends its turn with two giant hammer

04:12:14.283 --> 04:12:19.896
swings towards your illusory Jester just through
it with no effect. Angrily swings again.

04:12:19.896 --> 04:12:24.887
No effect. Definitely knows it's an illusion now
but wasted its entire turn doing that. That

04:12:24.887 --> 04:12:33.348
being the case, it's going to go ahead and move.
(counting) 20. The thing sinks into the lava

04:12:33.348 --> 04:12:39.775
and its feet (sizzling sounds) into it. Doesn't
matter. It is now starting to step out of the

04:12:39.775 --> 04:12:44.578
lava. Has one leg up and its hammer ready,
and it's just steaming towards like you

04:12:44.578 --> 04:12:49.832
like an angry freight train. That ends their
turn. Moving forward, Yasha's up. Anything?

04:12:49.832 --> 04:12:53.364
TRAVIS: Yasha will put her hand on Fjord
and hit healing hands, giving him

04:12:53.364 --> 04:12:57.903
seven hit points and yell to Caleb: Caleb!

04:12:57.903 --> 04:13:00.654
MATT: All right, Nott's turn.

04:13:00.654 --> 04:13:03.259
SAM: (screams) Am I on fire?

04:13:03.259 --> 04:13:06.490
MATT: No. Fjord has put the fire out.

04:13:06.490 --> 04:13:11.699
SAM: Then I will stick my head out through
the door and shoot a crossbow bolt

04:13:11.699 --> 04:13:18.341
at that giant that is stalking my friend
Caleb. Not great. 16.

04:13:18.341 --> 04:13:22.322
MATT: 16 misses or it hits but it hits the plate
armor in its chest and just ricochets off.

04:13:22.322 --> 04:13:26.866
SAM: I shoot him again. Bonus action.
Not great. 17.

04:13:26.866 --> 04:13:30.062
MATT: 17. Actually, it hits the armor and
gets stuck but it didn't pierce enough

04:13:30.062 --> 04:13:31.848
to actually hurt the giant.

04:13:31.848 --> 04:13:33.283
SAM: Okay. That's it.

04:13:33.283 --> 04:13:35.088
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. Caleb,
your turn.

04:13:35.088 --> 04:13:40.199
LIAM: For an action, I will disengage and
juke left-right and run into the hole.

04:13:40.199 --> 04:13:48.626
TALIESIN: The second Caleb is through the hole,
the stone is sealing. The entire door is gone.

04:13:48.626 --> 04:13:50.237
It's just rock again.

04:13:50.237 --> 04:13:52.256
MATT: The entire door wall closes off
with five feet of stone.

04:13:52.256 --> 04:13:55.522
TRAVIS: Five feet is not enough.
We must keep running.

04:13:55.522 --> 04:13:59.196
MATT: As soon as that happens, you're like,
"Awesome. All right, let's go!" and you hear

04:13:59.196 --> 04:14:03.351
(pounding) from the back. The stone is already
(cracking).

04:14:03.351 --> 04:14:05.211
TRAVIS: Must go faster.

04:14:05.301 --> 04:14:09.280
MATT: All right. You guys go running and running.
You hear the impacts from behind get more and more

04:14:09.280 --> 04:14:18.651
distant as you feel like you've managed to safely
make your way beyond this strange encounter from

04:14:18.651 --> 04:14:25.352
the outskirts of this unknown fire giant citadel.
And that's when we'll finish tonight's episode.

04:14:25.536 --> 04:14:28.890
(cheering)

04:14:28.890 --> 04:14:31.138
LIAM: Chris! Join us at the table.

04:14:31.138 --> 04:14:32.833
TALIESIN: Dude! Come here.

04:14:32.833 --> 04:14:34.446
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

04:14:34.446 --> 04:14:37.677
LAURA: Oh my goodness gracious.

04:14:37.677 --> 04:14:44.391
CHRIS: Somebody wrote a poem for me:
Here lay the chunks / Of a kobold named Spurt /

04:14:44.391 --> 04:14:53.196
He beat his skunks / So they wouldn't squirt. /
He feared no foes / And snacked on scat /

04:14:53.196 --> 04:14:57.480
But against a giant's blows / He soon went splat.

04:14:57.480 --> 04:14:59.882
(cheering)

04:14:59.882 --> 04:15:00.861
MATT: Who sent that?

04:15:00.861 --> 04:15:03.545
CHRIS: That was Dusty Patron of Hugs, @geonerd.

04:15:03.611 --> 04:15:05.212
LAURA: That was lovely.

04:15:05.212 --> 04:15:08.639
MATT: Well done. Well, thank you guys.
Thank you so much Chris for jumping in.

04:15:08.639 --> 04:15:10.254
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yay!

04:15:10.254 --> 04:15:12.582
TALIESIN: That was such a surprise.

04:15:12.582 --> 04:15:20.232
TRAVIS: Fuck you and your magma damage.
18d8. Oh my god.

04:15:20.232 --> 04:15:28.471
MATT: Just to remind everyone: we are taking a
week off from Critical Role next Thursday and

04:15:28.471 --> 04:15:35.407
Talks will be off on that Tuesday the 12th
so we'll be back the 14th at 7pm here.

04:15:35.407 --> 04:15:41.910
LAURA: Also, poster and prints in the store now.
Art prints. I'm still talking like Jester

04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:44.791
and we still have our awesome shirt.

04:15:44.791 --> 04:15:46.891
SAM: But Talks is going to be on this Tuesday?

04:15:46.891 --> 04:15:54.055
MATT: Yes, this Tuesday but not the Tuesday after.
But yeah, we'll see you soon enough. Until then,

04:15:54.055 --> 04:15:58.243
we love you guys, have a wonderful week,
and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

04:15:58.243 --> 04:16:00.092
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

04:16:00.092 --> 04:16:10.238
