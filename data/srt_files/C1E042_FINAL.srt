1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,709
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:08,550
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and
play Dungeons and Dragons, while Liam curses at me

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,174
a few seconds before we start the show to try and
throw me off. It's worked once before.

4
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:13,846
TALIESIN: Cock goblins.

5
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:18,910
MATT: It'll probably work again. (laughs) Welcome
to the show. So yeah, for the returning friends,

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,616
thank you for coming, and for new folks, welcome
to the chaos.

7
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:22,984
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out.

8
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,518
LAURA: Don't say that.

9
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,958
MATT: It's already so hostile here tonight. So I
guess first and foremost, let's see if we can get

10
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:35,130
through these announcements pretty quick. First
and foremost, a reminder, me and Marisha will be

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,076
in Colorado tomorrow at the Colorado Anime Fest.
We'll be guests this weekend there, so if any

12
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:44,432
folks are coming out, we'll look forward to seeing
you. We'll be flying over bright and early

13
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:46,713
tomorrow morning. Taliesin, you're also--

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:52,220
TALIESIN: I will be in Phoenix, Arizona at the
Amazing Comic Con, and if you follow me on

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:58,389
Twitter, @executivegoth, I will actually tell you
where I will be at the convention at various

16
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:59,357
times.

17
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:00,683
MATT: So you can stalk him.

18
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:03,136
TALIESIN: You can stalk me. I'll be very
stalkable. E-stalk.

19
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:05,559
MARISHA: It's like Santa Tracker, but Taliesin
Tracker.

20
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:13,770
MATT: Yeah. Waldo Tracker. Why has nobody done
that yet? Give it some time. Let's see. Also, I

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,299
guess, tonight we're going to be trying out this
new table camera here on the side to give you a

22
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,723
separate view of the battle. We can switch around
as we're finding our way through the amorphous

23
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,779
betterment of our program.

24
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:31,748
LIAM: Can we work in like a Wolf Blizter hologram?
Like they have on CNN as well?

25
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,441
MATT: I'll put that on the wish list.

26
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,824
LIAM: On the table, next to all the guys.

27
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:39,265
MATT: Only if it's actually Wolf Blitzer, though.
If we can have him running through the

28
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,784
battlefield, it'll be great.

29
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,016
TALIESIN: Just his head, floating.

30
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:46,285
MATT: But yeah, so you can head to the Geek and
Sundry Amazon wish list, the link should be in the

31
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:50,375
chat, for other things they're looking for to
hopefully try and improve this experience and

32
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:54,638
bring it to you guys and be even better going
forward. So you can check that out, and this

33
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:58,466
camera's our first leap in that direction, so you
can let us know how you think it works and bear

34
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:05,066
with us as we still figure this whole thing out.
Let's see. Also, next week, most of us will be at

35
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:10,919
Wizard World Portland. That's our first Wizard
World, you can check out the website for information

36
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,852
about our events and signings and tickets and
stuff like that, so go check it out, please, we

37
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:22,822
look forward to seeing you guys, and we'll see you
up in Portland next weekend. What else do we have

38
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:24,097
going on?

39
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:28,177
LIAM: Well, you know, we have an ongoing
relationship with Wyrmwood Gaming, which you can

40
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:33,326
find on the internet. They make beautiful boxes
for holding dice and stuff, and if you use the

41
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:39,947
code "critrole," "critrole," you will get free
shipping. They have all different kinds of woods,

42
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:46,437
they're lovely. And then also, hey, this is an
impromptu announcement, but Kurtis Wiebe just

43
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:51,479
announced on the Twitters, Kurtis Wiebe is the
writer for the comic book Rat Queens.

44
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,854
LAURA: Amazing.

45
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:58,472
LIAM: We all are addicted to it. He works with
Tess Fowler, who's the artist right now, and

46
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:05,923
basically their outfit and our outfit are in love,
and Kurtis announced on Twitter today that he is

47
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:11,041
going to be shoving Vox Machina in there in some
way, somehow, and we're very excited.

48
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,897
LAURA: We're making a cameo appearance in Rat
Queens, you guys!

49
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,714
TALIESIN: Our first cameo.

50
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:17,330
SAM: I want to be the rat!

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:26,390
MATT: (laughs) You would, wouldn't you? So stupid
excited for that. Can't even. I can't even. It's

52
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:35,101
so dumb. So dumb. Life is dumb. Life is dumb. But
yeah. So, we got that going on. I can't think of

53
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:39,464
anything else. If anything else comes up, we'll
throw it in there in the mid-break, but in the

54
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,424
meantime--

55
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:45,442
SAM: Oh yeah, I want to give a quick shout-out to
my charity of choice, the Pablove Foundation.

56
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:46,346
MATT: Yes!

57
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:51,559
SAM: I talked to them today. Their minds were
blown by all the gifts that people have sent in

58
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:57,776
and donations in the name of Critical Role and the
Critter community. They didn't quite understand

59
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:04,529
what the Critter community was, but I enlightened
them, and they're so jazzed by you guys. And they

60
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:10,270
appreciate not just the donations and gifts, but
also, they said that the Critters have been

61
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,669
writing long letters and telling great stories and
stuff, and they're super excited.

62
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,726
MARISHA: That's awesome!

63
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:19,629
SAM: So keep it going to those charities. The
Pablove Foundation.

64
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:22,543
MARISHA: Yeah, should we go off and do a shout-out
of each of our charities?

65
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:23,480
MATT: Sure, go for it.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:31,227
TALIESIN: First Place for Youth. I'll have a link
up to my Twitter in about five minutes. They help

67
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:37,625
kids get through school, they help kids who are
orphaned and having issues get their stuff

68
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,572
together and become fabulous teenagers like we
need in this world.

69
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,721
MARISHA: We do. And of course, Sam is with Pablove
Foundation.

70
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,326
SAM: The Pablove Foundation.

71
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:52,211
MARISHA: Pablove Foundation, which is amazing. I
chose the Nature Conservancy. They're great and

72
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:58,510
they protect the lands and the animals that is
very important so we can keep having a beautiful

73
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,783
green world.

74
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:06,651
LIAM: I chose the Planetary Society, just in case
the green world dies, and it promotes exploration

75
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:09,990
of space, and the stuff like that.

76
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,784
LAURA: I chose My Friend's Place, which is an
awesome, very similar to Taliesin's, it's an

77
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:19,877
awesome place for teenagers that are runaways or
living on the streets. It gives them a place that

78
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:23,359
they can crash and really help get their stuff
together.

79
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,987
MATT: 'Sup, Jewel-face?

80
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:27,401
TRAVIS: I am the Vision.

81
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,909
(laughter)

82
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,059
MATT: Donate to the Vision.

83
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:36,285
TRAVIS: Yes, I have Operation Supply Drop, which
is a great charity service that delivers fun where

84
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:41,788
there is none to soldiers that are in combat
overseas. It delivers gaming systems, games,

85
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:48,774
brings some much-needed levity to areas of high
intensity and overall warrior badassmanship, and

86
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:50,894
I'm very proud of that.

87
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:53,133
LIAM: What a variety of charities.

88
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,981
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good stretch of
charities.

89
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,270
MATT: My charity.

90
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,138
MARISHA and SAM: Oh, yeah.

91
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,285
MATT: I got one too, guys!

92
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:00,753
MARISHA: Sorry. I sometimes forget about you,
because you're on that side.

93
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:01,875
MATT: I know, it happens.

94
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:02,913
LIAM: You're god!

95
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:08,286
MATT: Hey, no, overlooked my entire life,
it's nothing new. My charity is First Book, which

96
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:13,874
brings reading materials to underprivileged
children and helps people become more confident

97
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:21,464
readers and youth that don't have access to
programs to help promote literary adventure and

98
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:27,391
really delving into the amazing thing that is
reading. Thank you guys for helping us support

99
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,063
that, it's been really fantastic.

100
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:31,423
MARISHA: All things that are important for the
future.

101
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,010
MATT: So important. More than you'd give it
credit for. Yes.

102
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,540
MARISHA: And of course, as always, Critical Role
always supports 826LA.

103
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,231
LAURA: Yes, continually.

104
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:45,942
MARISHA: Continually. They are our sponsored
charity of choice, and of course look up 826,

105
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:51,267
there might be an 826 in your area. And you should
go to their storefronts. They make great date

106
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,024
locations, as Taliesin always says.

107
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:54,296
TALIESIN: Yes, great date.

108
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,334
LAURA: Oh, they really do, that is a really good
place.

109
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,710
MATT: Find a date. Take them there.

110
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,249
MARISHA: Find the date first.

111
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,760
MATT: Tell them Critical Role sent you.

112
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,374
MARISHA: Don't try and find dates at 826. That
gets-- that's bad.

113
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:08,744
(laughter)

114
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,680
TALIESIN: Wow, you took that to a dark place. You
took that--

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,529
MATT: Anyway. So. So. Let us go ahead and delve
into tonight's game proper, folks. So, to get you

116
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:25,078
up to speed, Vox Machina, the intrepid band of
adventurers you see before you, after a series of

117
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:30,136
adventures, had found their way back to their
central city of Emon, in the center of the region

118
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:37,379
of Tal'Dorei. After a ceremony in which the leader
of their city, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei, was

119
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:44,225
announcing him stepping down, the town was
suddenly under siege by a group of extremely

120
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:51,929
powerful and dangerous ancient dragons that call
themselves the Chroma Conclave. After tearing the

121
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:57,884
city asunder in many places, three of them flew
off into the east under the instruction of the

122
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:03,251
fourth and possibly largest and leader of the
group, that has recently been found to be called

123
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:10,172
Thordak the Cinder King, who currently resides in
the center of the city of Emon, claiming that his

124
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:16,369
mercy is only for those who worship him and
essentially feed his greed and hunger. As such,

125
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:20,973
Vox Machina, narrowly escaping the battle, a
couple of encounters with these dragons, including

126
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:25,284
one above their Keep, are housing a number of
survivors who have made their way out of the city

127
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:32,202
and are currently residing in Greyskull Keep for
protection. You guys went into the city to see if

128
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:38,917
you could find any other allies and friends that
may have survived this encounter. You befriended a

129
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:45,769
member of the Clasp, named Garthok, who walked
amongst the rubble and proceeded to show you the

130
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:51,494
secret entrance he knows to the Clasp, of which
you may be trying to inquire about information. On

131
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:58,581
your way to that area, you passed by Gilmore's
shop, Gilmore being a good friend of the group and

132
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,992
a powerful magic practitioner and creator of
magical items and artifacts and a number of

133
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:10,074
glorious goods. His abode, however, smashed and
currently a pile of burnt wood and rock. Looters

134
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:16,014
were currently poring through, and you attempted
to get them to leave the area alone. It came to

135
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:21,506
blows, and with many of the looters falling in
battle, two of which were kept locked away. You discovered

136
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:27,274
the location of where they were hoarding the
massive amounts of gold and artifacts that they

137
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:32,252
had acquired from the rubble. You then found the
secret compartment in which Gilmore's

138
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:40,480
teleportation sigil was locked beneath his shop,
where the remaining family of Tal'Dorei, Salda and

139
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:48,073
the three children, as well as Gilmore himself,
wounded and barely alive, having saved them. You

140
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:52,677
found that Uriel, the Sovereign, did not seemingly
survive the encounter with the dragons, and

141
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:58,967
Gilmore nearly fell going back to try and make
sure that you guys were okay, barely escaping with

142
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:05,904
his life. You managed to save his, and taking the
children, Salda, Sherri, and Gilmore back to

143
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:11,006
Greyskull Keep, some of you splintered off to try
and acquire the goods that were taken from his

144
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:14,814
store, however, they apparently had already been
stolen from the location they were being stored

145
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:20,075
in, or been delivered already, you're uncertain as
to what became of them, but you get the sense that

146
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:26,895
it was probably best that you chose Gilmore over the
gold at first glance. Making your way back to the

147
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:32,899
Keep, you've sent Gilmore up to rest for the
evening, some of you have then found your way down

148
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:39,693
into the temple of Sarenrae, where a number of the
escaped refugees from Emon currently try

149
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:47,570
desperately to cling to their memories, to try and
keep the shakes at bay and contemplate what the

150
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:55,099
next step is for survival in this now partially
ruined city. That was where we left off. So. What

151
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:58,818
would you like to do?

152
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:01,798
SAM: Kill all the dragons and save the day.

153
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,678
MATT: Good! Roll for it.

154
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:07,073
LAURA: Oh, that was a good roll. See?

155
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:09,263
TALIESIN: Natural 20. No, no.

156
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:11,289
MARISHA: Good show, guys.

157
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:15,590
LAURA: I rolled five natural 20s before the show
even started.

158
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,954
SAM: That's a great, great idea.

159
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:19,166
LAURA: So it's all going to be terrible.

160
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,189
SAM: Why are you rolling before the show?

161
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:25,550
TRAVIS: She feels like she's got to "warm up" her
endless army of dice.

162
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,702
LAURA: No, I just have to figure out which ones I
want to use that night.

163
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:31,041
TRAVIS: You have five d20s right now.

164
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,760
LAURA: I know, and they're all useful. No, I've
got six out here.

165
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,567
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, definitely all useful.

166
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,210
TALIESIN: This is, by the way, for anybody tuning
in for the first time at home, this is how we

167
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,213
express that we have no idea what to do.

168
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:47,711
SAM: Where are we?

169
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:49,183
TALIESIN: We're at home.

170
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:50,255
MATT: You're in Greyskull Keep.

171
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,555
SAM: And Gilmore's with us?

172
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,249
MATT: Gilmore's with you, he's been brought
upstairs--

173
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:59,176
LIAM: And did Pike's holy visitor fix the keep, or
is the keep still effed up?

174
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:05,456
MATT: Actually, in the short time in which her
visitor, this angelic deva-like entity that was

175
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:10,592
brought forth from Sarenrae's sphere of influence,
did manage to repair entirely the damage that was

176
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:17,606
sustained to the Keep from the battle with Vorugal
out in your courtyard. So yes, Greyskull Keep is

177
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:23,808
now back to being intact and rather fairly
polished. The stained glass is affixed and

178
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:24,943
corrected.

179
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:30,700
LIAM: It must look so strange next to the ruined
city of Emon.

180
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,475
MATT: It's far enough away, but--

181
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:34,572
LAURA: Little strange.

182
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:39,579
MARISHA: So what time is it? It was nighttime,
right? Or was it midday?

183
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,651
MATT: It's about midafternoon at this point, maybe
pushing into the evening.

184
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,299
TALIESIN: Is Kima still around?

185
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,632
MATT: I'm sorry, what was that?

186
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,746
TALIESIN: Is Lady Kima still around, or?

187
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:50,231
MATT: Lady Kima's been in Vasselheim.

188
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:53,753
TALIESIN: Oh, not Vasselheim, I'm sorry. Allura.
I'm on the wrong page.

189
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,337
MATT: Yeah, she and Drake went.

190
00:12:56,337 --> 00:13:01,174
MARISHA: Remember, they turned into shooting stars
and they flew away.

191
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:03,357
SAM: Is Clarota still here with us?

192
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,735
(laughter)

193
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,680
LAURA: We're off to a good start tonight, guys.

194
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,586
MATT: In your hearts. In your heart of hearts.

195
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:15,231
TRAVIS: No, not even there. That piece of shit.
Where are the majority of the people? Are they in

196
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,040
the dining hall and in the--

197
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,628
MATT: They're scattered between the dining hall
and the temple to Sarenrae. Partially because,

198
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:28,567
one, there's enough space there, two, it's a place
of sanctity, it's a place of hope, and Pike is

199
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:35,218
currently bringing people-- not preaching to them,
per se, but offering comfort in their current area

200
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:42,569
of misery and worry. So those are pretty much the
localized areas. Occasionally one of the kids

201
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:46,943
might begin wandering the halls, a parent might
chase after them, trying to draw them back in, but

202
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:51,483
respectfully, no one's wandering the house filling
their pockets, they're all still happy to be alive

203
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:52,481
at this point.

204
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,976
LAURA: Well, that's because we don't have
anything, because Scanlan's troupe stole

205
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:55,992
everything anyway.

206
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:56,933
MATT: There's that, too.

207
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,476
SAM: We bought new silverware.

208
00:13:58,476 --> 00:13:59,871
TRAVIS: Sure we did.

209
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:06,610
SAM: Maybe it wasn't my troupe, maybe it was our
new guests, the people fleeing for their lives.

210
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,856
TRAVIS: I was going to say, are there any new
people that have come into the keep while we've

211
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:12,390
been away? Can I ask one of our guards that?

212
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:18,445
MATT: Sure, yeah. Shayne, who's out front,
currently strolling through the courtyard, comes

213
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:26,180
up to you, and as you ask her, she goes, "Well,
we've had a few other refugees come in and ask for

214
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,026
"entry, and we patted them down to make sure there
were no weapons and tried our best to keep an eye

215
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:36,702
"on them since they arrived. Seems like most
everyone's keeping either into the city or keeping

216
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,189
"fairly underground."

217
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:43,853
TRAVIS: Nobody's sticking out to you, though, no
shady individuals, nobody sweating more than is

218
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:47,791
necessary when being threatened by a big fuck-off
dragon?

219
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,387
MATT: "Not yet, but I believe Jarett's keeping a
close eye."

220
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:52,836
TRAVIS: Jarett--

221
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:58,090
SAM: That guy. Man-crush?

222
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,254
TRAVIS: No.

223
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:04,191
(laughter)

224
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:17,510
SAM: I wonder, in all prudence, should we go
around to the 'fugees, the refugees and do a

225
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,854
quick--

226
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,047
LAURA: Insight check?

227
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,691
SAM: -- scan, alignment check or something?

228
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:27,022
TRAVIS: Lauryn Hill is shaking her head.

229
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:30,548
LAURA: Do we have anything that can sense people's
alignment?

230
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:32,049
SAM: Pike might.

231
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,878
MARISHA: Yeah, I can.

232
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:37,270
SAM: Can you do a mass, a mass sense alignment?

233
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,272
MARISHA: Mass sense alignment?

234
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,401
SAM: Is that a thing?

235
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,862
MARISHA: No, I'm saying I could do some insight
checks on people.

236
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:45,160
SAM: Oh, I'm talking about your magic.

237
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,127
MARISHA: No, I'm not Pike.

238
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:48,221
SAM: All right.

239
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:51,928
TRAVIS: Pike's with us, though, right? She could
do an insight check.

240
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,467
SAM: Is she with us?

241
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:57,229
MATT: Pike is with you. She is currently helping
folks inside the temple. But you could go ask her

242
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:58,195
to.

243
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:03,068
LIAM: Use the skull to wish to know everyone's
alignment. Problem solved.

244
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:06,522
TRAVIS: We'll kill everyone. Kill everyone.

245
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:08,921
SAM: Maybe we should just kill one of them to make
an example.

246
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:11,279
LAURA: This is terrible, what is happening?

247
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,256
LIAM: This isn't the real game, the game hasn't
actually started yet.

248
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:24,947
MATT: So. Glancing about the populace of scattered
refugees throughout the general vicinity of

249
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:31,775
Greyskull Keep, I will pick two of you who wish to
be the main surveyors of the crew.

250
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,195
SAM: Is this insight?

251
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:34,462
MATT: This would be insight, yes.

252
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:35,545
LAURA: I'm on it.

253
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:36,730
MARISHA: I'm on it with Vex.

254
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,085
MATT: Okay, so Vex and Keyleth, both you guys roll
insight checks, please.

255
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:45,142
LAURA: See, this is why I shouldn't have this many
dice, because I don't know what to choose. Okay.

256
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:47,466
21.

257
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,403
LIAM: Insight?

258
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:50,630
MARISHA: 22.

259
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,635
LAURA: 21.

260
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:56,465
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys spend about ten, 15
minutes or so scanning through the crew, asking a

261
00:16:56,465 --> 00:17:02,847
few questions, helping a few folks out while
keeping an eye on reactions around the general

262
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:13,212
vicinity. No one sticks out to you as being either
hiding their intent, shifty. There are a few folks

263
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:18,538
that are aloof from the whole experience, who seem
to be either in a state of shock, or discomfort

264
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:24,702
based on their current surroundings, but nothing
in a way that strikes you as nefarious or

265
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:25,850
worrisome.

266
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,882
LIAM: And are they all strangers, other than the
people we brought back with us?

267
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,076
MATT: Correct.

268
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:32,353
LIAM: They are strangers?

269
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:35,782
MATT: Yeah. There's a lot of people that live in
Emon, and none of them seem to catch your eye.

270
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:38,249
LIAM: Yeah. Is anyone still badly hurt?

271
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:44,348
MATT: Most of them have had their wounds tended
to. There are a few that have general scars, some

272
00:17:44,348 --> 00:17:49,642
from elements of frostbite on their skin, who were
caught in the blast, who were salvaged after

273
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:56,445
Vorugal left. There are a few that have scrapes
and bruises from fleeing from the town, from

274
00:17:56,445 --> 00:18:02,901
collapsing debris from different buildings and
such, but no serious injuries. A few bone

275
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:05,245
fractures here and there that have been set and
bandaged.

276
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:11,356
LIAM: I'm going to spend the first bit of time at
home helping Pike, doing whatever she tells me to

277
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,765
do, really, to help the people here.

278
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:17,616
MARISHA: Is there any deceased that need to be
tended to?

279
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:21,449
MATT: Well, there are a number of deceased in the
front courtyard, people that were frozen and

280
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:27,122
shattered as part of Vorugal's attack, which at
this point, most of them have been taken care of

281
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:32,413
by the guards and given a proper burial on the
outside of the Keep, a few yards away, towards the

282
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:37,225
inside of the one of the hills. They haven't been
left to thaw, if that was what you're worried

283
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,101
about.

284
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:39,350
MARISHA: That's what I was worried about.

285
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,077
TALIESIN: Red meat. Red.

286
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,736
LAURA: Gross.

287
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:46,382
LIAM: Way to go dark. Way to go dark.

288
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,511
TALIESIN: I thought that's what we were doing
today.

289
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:54,558
MATT: Cost-effective. A number of the refugees
have also helped the guards as well, transporting

290
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,261
the bodies of the deceased and making sure that
they're properly interred in the nearby

291
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,345
countryside.

292
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:00,499
MARISHA: Okay.

293
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:08,424
SAM: What are our options here? First of all, do
we know Gilmore's status?

294
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:11,551
LAURA: Yeah, we need to get him settled in, make
sure he's all right.

295
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,068
LIAM: Well, he's gone up, he's resting.

296
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,190
MARISHA: Yeah, we put him to bed already.

297
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,202
LIAM: He's in Percival's room, I think. You said
you would sleep in your laboratory.

298
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,985
SAM: And when we last left things, there was one
plan to go into the tunnels of the thieves' guild

299
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:28,262
and try to see if there's any more--

300
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:31,343
LAURA: Yes. Actually, Garthok.

301
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:32,778
MARISHA: Yes.

302
00:19:32,778 --> 00:19:40,980
LAURA: Garthok is waiting for us down in those, so
we can go look at the Clasp and talk to them and

303
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,361
everything, because he's told them we're on our
way.

304
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:48,699
SAM: And to what end, again? We're going to see if
there's any random diplomats left over?

305
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:52,863
TALIESIN: They're the only functioning
organization left in the city at this point.

306
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:57,463
LIAM: It's true, they're a double-edged sword,
though. I mean, they should not be trusted, we

307
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:02,245
cannot trust them, but they are an infrastructure
under the city. They may have more of an idea

308
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:07,224
what's going on than we do. I'm the best to speak
to them, but I'm not on good terms with them, and

309
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:14,502
I've never really talked to you about this, but
you were marked at one point, a long time ago.

310
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:15,650
LAURA: What?

311
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,421
SAM: For death?

312
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,885
LIAM: Actually, yes.

313
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,895
LAURA: Why? What did I do?

314
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:36,542
LIAM: I'm sure I don't know. The reason there is a
brand on my back is because I interceded. Some

315
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:45,048
other schmoe died instead of you. You might be a
bit of a sore point with them. I don't know. They

316
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:49,252
might not remember, but I don't think that's true,
I think they'll remember.

317
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:51,286
MARISHA: How long ago was this?

318
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:55,195
SAM: What did you do?

319
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:57,433
LAURA: So many things.

320
00:20:57,433 --> 00:21:01,484
LIAM: Before we met, when Vex and I were on our
own.

321
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:04,451
SAM: Was it because you farted that time?

322
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:09,565
LAURA: You didn't think you could mention this?
All the times we've dealt with the Clasp? You

323
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:11,884
didn't think it was worth mentioning that I almost
died?

324
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:16,215
MARISHA: She's already been down there. She's
already been down there! You think they're going

325
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:17,677
to recognize her now?

326
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,724
LIAM: We're going down to talk.

327
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:22,822
LAURA: We've been down there to talk.

328
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:26,196
LIAM: Right. All right.

329
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:28,770
LAURA: That's why you don't keep secrets.

330
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,671
TALIESIN: Well, I say that we organize a group.
Let's not get overexcited about the sudden

331
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:43,790
realization that some of us can be a bit iffy.
We've all had a moment, probably within the last

332
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,177
three weeks. I'm not saying I don't.

333
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:49,025
TRAVIS: I haven't.

334
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:55,022
TALIESIN: Yes, oddly, you and Pike seem to be
immune.

335
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,772
TRAVIS: It is a virtue.

336
00:21:56,772 --> 00:22:01,575
TALIESIN: But let's organize a group, and let's at
least open relations with them at this point.

337
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:06,113
MARISHA: Well, hang on, hang on. What are we going
to say to them when we get down there? What are we

338
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:08,747
going to offer them?

339
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:14,255
TALIESIN: We are going to offer them our services
in getting this city back to a functioning level.

340
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:21,343
They don't want a city ruled by a dragon, we don't
want a city ruled by a dragon. It's in their

341
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:23,626
interest to help us clear the city.

342
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:28,235
LIAM: They're going to look out for themselves,
and you're probably-- I'm sure you're right, they

343
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:34,154
want these dragons out, but they will do-- they
will preserve their own existence, and there's a

344
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:41,937
possibility that bowing before these beasts will
preserve their existence.

345
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:44,625
TALIESIN: Not long-term, and these are groups that
think long-term.

346
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:48,326
MARISHA: Wait, are you talking about us bowing to
the Clasp, or the Clasp bowing to the-- okay.

347
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,218
Sorry, there were levels.

348
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:53,890
LIAM: And yes, we've been down there, we've argued
with them, but we're talking about going down

349
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,758
there and making an alliance, an ongoing alliance,
and shit might come up, that's all I'm saying.

350
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:05,466
TALIESIN: Let's make it a business deal. We're
talking about making a political decision. This is

351
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:06,439
politics.

352
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:10,091
TRAVIS: What if they leave? What if they leave the
city, or what if they turn us in to the dragon to

353
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,772
save their own asses?

354
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:16,140
TALIESIN: They could. I doubt they'd leave, that's
a terrible waste of an investment.

355
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,156
MARISHA: You're essentially relying on the
underbelly of Emon to restore it.

356
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:28,295
TALIESIN: I am, I'm relying on greed, it tends to
be exceedingly reliable.

357
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:29,795
MARISHA: In your experience.

358
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:30,831
TALIESIN: Yes.

359
00:23:30,831 --> 00:23:32,291
LAURA: In all experience, let's be honest.

360
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,366
TALIESIN: Thank you.

361
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:35,557
TRAVIS: Said the greedy one to the greedy one.

362
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:39,378
LIAM: This is one option, are we sure we don't
want to seek help--

363
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,143
SAM: Yes, what are our other options?

364
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:42,442
TALIESIN: I'm curious as to other options.

365
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:45,605
SAM: We know why the dragons are here, right?
Ish?

366
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:53,553
MARISHA: I really feel like it might be necessary
for me to also reach out to the Air and Earth and

367
00:23:53,553 --> 00:24:00,357
possibly even the Water Ashari. It might be
difficult because I haven't been there yet. To see

368
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:04,645
if they've had any other tears through the other
elemental planes.

369
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,276
TALIESIN: That would be quite wise.

370
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:09,854
MARISHA: We can also seek to employ their
services.

371
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:11,916
TRAVIS: Scanlan.

372
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,095
SAM: Huh?

373
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:15,737
TRAVIS: What about you becoming a spy?

374
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:18,858
SAM: I've been thinking about that, long and
hard.

375
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,965
MARISHA: Have you?

376
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:20,948
SAM: Yes.

377
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:22,364
MARISHA: What are your thoughts?

378
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:28,840
SAM: Most of what I do is long and hard. And my
thoughts are still: fuck you, no way, fuck off.

379
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,929
TRAVIS: So what you're saying is?

380
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:32,775
SAM: Maybe.

381
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:35,622
(laughter)

382
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:37,732
LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance.

383
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:42,254
TRAVIS: Your shining moment--

384
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:47,198
TALIESIN: Nothing is ever going to top the
triceratops, really.

385
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:50,425
SAM: Maybe the triceratops could kill all the
dragons.

386
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:53,828
TRAVIS: All right. So we reach out to the Ashari.

387
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:55,138
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

388
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:57,382
SAM: How's your homeland?

389
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:58,720
TALIESIN: I don't know.

390
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,120
SAM: Do we need to find out?

391
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,392
TALIESIN: I would love to.

392
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:03,212
SAM: You can transport there instantly.

393
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:05,584
TALIESIN: I can. I just can't get back instantly.

394
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,409
LAURA: You need Keyleth.

395
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:12,636
TALIESIN: And I figure that they would have sent
somebody at this point if things had gone-- they

396
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,465
have an instant transport to us if they need to
find us.

397
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:16,334
SAM: True.

398
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:20,103
LAURA: Unless they don't know about the stone and
the only one with the stone--

399
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,713
TALIESIN: The Council knows about the stone.

400
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:24,307
TRAVIS: Or there's no one left to send.

401
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:25,821
LIAM: Yes, if things went south--

402
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:27,257
TALIESIN: We would've heard.

403
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:29,510
MARISHA: I can scry twice today.

404
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,998
TALIESIN: That would be lovely.

405
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:39,175
MARISHA: I can do it two times. So we need to pick
where it's most important to check in versus where

406
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:42,730
we might want to pop in and say hello.

407
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:50,426
TALIESIN: Whitestone is also somewhere we could
arm ourselves more completely against something

408
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:52,191
like this. We're going to have to start--

409
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:53,463
TRAVIS: With what?

410
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:55,612
MATT: As a note, too, Pike can also scry as well.

411
00:25:55,612 --> 00:25:59,675
LAURA: Oh, good. Because I would like to check in
to Vasselheim as well.

412
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:03,715
SAM: How do you kill a dragon? Do we need a
dragon? Can we get a dragon that hates these

413
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:05,172
dragons? Is that a thing?

414
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,673
LAURA: You know, there is the Slayer's Take.

415
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:11,445
TRAVIS: Wait, what are we talking about dragons?
Do other dragons hate dragons?

416
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,009
SAM: Yeah, could we find a dragon who could fight
for us?

417
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:16,687
LAURA: Well, there's metallic dragons.

418
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:18,944
LIAM: Don't get along with chromatic.

419
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,610
SAM: Do we know any metallic dragons?

420
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,612
TRAVIS: Yeah, where are they?

421
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:24,785
MARISHA: We would have to go to Vasselheim and
maybe--

422
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,066
TALIESIN: My Aunt Edna.

423
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,563
TRAVIS: What?

424
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:30,663
TALIESIN: She's a dragon-lady, I don't know if
that's the same thing.

425
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:36,735
MARISHA: Like, oh, like she-- little ceramic
dragons, she likes collecting them?

426
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:38,699
TALIESIN: I was mocking him, yes.

427
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:42,345
SAM: So, wait, the Slayer's Take, what?

428
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:47,995
LAURA: Well, it's an organization made to hunt
massive creatures, isn't it?

429
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:51,582
LIAM: It's a horde of fucking ass-kickers, is what
it is.

430
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:53,867
TALIESIN: We fought a dragon-- we killed a dragon
for them.

431
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:56,577
MARISHA: They're also rooted in Vasselheim, which
is--

432
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:57,918
SAM: It's safe.

433
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:03,265
LAURA: Yes, but-- If everything else is under
attack, Vasselheim is inevitable.

434
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:05,338
SAM: Yes, but they're protected.

435
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:06,828
LAURA: For a time.

436
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:17,597
LIAM: Allow me to play tiefling's advocate. If we
leave now and allow the Clasp to take hold and

437
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:24,695
form some sort of new shadow government, without
us having any part in it, it's out of our control

438
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:30,787
completely. It won't be in our control at all. But
maybe if we speak to them now, we'll have a better

439
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:37,557
idea of what's going on. I'm not sold on any idea
yet, but if we leave now and let things play out,

440
00:27:37,557 --> 00:27:40,046
it's entirely out of our hands.

441
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:44,222
MARISHA: All right, well, how about this? We can
scry, between Pike and I, four times. So we can

442
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:46,277
make four phone calls today.

443
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:47,918
SAM: Not phone calls, just a look.

444
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:59,856
MARISHA: Yes, look home. No, we can peek through a
window. And we can try and go visit the Clasp.

445
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:06,330
SAM: Okay, well, let's scry it up, then. Who are
we calling? Whitestone, Vasselheim, center of

446
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:07,509
Emon?

447
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:10,892
TALIESIN: Whitestone and Vasselheim, I think.
Definitely.

448
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:12,617
MARISHA: And I want to check in with--

449
00:28:12,617 --> 00:28:18,789
TRAVIS: Can I object to checking the center of
Emon, right? Because that's where the Cinder King is?

450
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:20,689
TALIESIN: Yes.

451
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:24,527
TRAVIS: Didn't it, like, ruin magic when we did it
to the beholder, didn't it see us and laugh and we

452
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:26,402
were like, augh, it hurts my brain--

453
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:29,712
TALIESIN: He's got a point. You've got a point.

454
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:31,289
SAM: You're pretty smart, Grog.

455
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:32,957
MARISHA: We don't need to scry into Emon.

456
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:34,786
TRAVIS: I remember.

457
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:42,627
LIAM: We're talking Vasselheim, yeah? Whitestone.
And you can do it another two--

458
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:46,273
MARISHA: You know what, let's go talk to Pike,
because Pike might possibly have some sort of

459
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:51,264
spiritual connection with Vasselheim as well that
might save us a scry.

460
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:57,276
TALIESIN: It's possible that Vasselheim might be
our next stop after we secure everything here.

461
00:28:57,276 --> 00:28:58,976
MARISHA: Okay.

462
00:28:58,976 --> 00:29:00,833
SAM: Oh, Pike! Oh.

463
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:05,583
MARISHA: I can also teleport us once today, if we
decide to go anywhere.

464
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,622
SAM: Thanks.

465
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,229
MARISHA: Pike!

466
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:09,895
SAM: Pike! Pikey!

467
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:13,318
MATT: Comes out, a little bit of dirt on her brow,
looks like she's been busy handling some of the

468
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,055
folks--

469
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:17,636
SAM: I reach out and brush the dirt from above her
forehead.

470
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:22,444
MATT: She smiles and pushes your hand away. "Yes,
what, yes?"

471
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:29,317
MARISHA: Pike, do you have any sort of spiritual
connection with Vasselheim? Do you feel-- you know

472
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:29,961
how--

473
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:33,519
MATT: "I do. I do. Why?"

474
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,867
MARISHA: Okay, can you check--

475
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:37,873
SAM: Can you scry?

476
00:29:37,873 --> 00:29:42,835
MARISHA: Can you see if they're okay? We want to
scry and check in with a few places.

477
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:47,331
MATT: "Of course, of course, no worries." She
ushers you guys back into the temple.

478
00:29:47,331 --> 00:29:48,253
MARISHA: Okay.

479
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,368
MATT: And then gets a little nervous when she
starts thinking about it and walks up to the

480
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:56,969
central platform of prayer and takes out her holy
symbol. Her armor's off right now, by the way,

481
00:29:56,969 --> 00:30:01,448
she's in her ceremonial robes. Because it's hard
to clank around in armor amongst a bunch of

482
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:09,981
refugees. Sits down and focuses for a second, and
pulls out some salt, and begins spreading it into

483
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:14,360
a small triangular shape around her, and then
pulls her holy symbol out and closes her eyes, and

484
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,730
for that moment, you can see a beam of sunlight
come through the roof, the glass roof of the

485
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:28,181
temple, which then refracts into multiple colors
that slowly dissipate around her. You can see,

486
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:32,264
everyone else that has gathered in the room falls
quiet, and watches on as there is this tiny little

487
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:39,571
visual miracle. And she stays there for a moment.
A few more moments. Probably about 30, 40 seconds

488
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:44,809
pass before the light slowly retracts back up
through the glass, and she stands up and turns

489
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:54,780
around and goes, "Vasselheim seems fine for now.
Untouched from the dragon's scourge, at the very

490
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,787
"least."

491
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,758
MARISHA &amp; LAURA: That's good.

492
00:30:56,758 --> 00:30:57,957
TALIESIN: What of Whitestone?

493
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:07,334
MATT: "Oh. Yes." She gets right back down into
position with an air of begrudging acceptance.

494
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:17,602
Focuses for a second. Spends a few more moments in
her scrying ritual before stepping back, and turns

495
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:28,374
slowly to you, Percy, and says, "Whitestone seems
fairly overlooked by these dragons as well. The

496
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:34,572
"town rebuilds. People seem to be going about their
lives. Possibly none the wiser as to what's

497
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:37,111
"transpired this side of Tal'Dorei."

498
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:39,835
TALIESIN: We'll send word, at the very least.

499
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:42,350
LAURA: It's all over the water. Maybe the dragons
haven't gone that far.

500
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,139
TALIESIN: It's far north. I'll make sure to send
word.

501
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:54,199
MATT: "Okay." One of the kids starts crying, and
she goes, "Oh, hold on." And goes over and starts

502
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:58,812
tending to one of the children who has like a knee
brace on, and is currently aching, and she goes to

503
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:00,791
help calm him down. "Shh, shh."

504
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:07,316
LIAM: Do you think you could look in on Syngorn?

505
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:10,527
MARISHA: Of course.

506
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:13,260
LAURA: Mostly to see, you know.

507
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,804
MARISHA: I step up to the table, and begin my
scrying ritual, checking on Syngorn first.

508
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,919
MATT: Okay.

509
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:24,815
TRAVIS: Shit.

510
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:26,566
LAURA: Come on.

511
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:32,372
TALIESIN: We need like cups and string or
something.

512
00:32:32,372 --> 00:32:41,015
SAM: We do. Or a walkie-talkie. He's saying,
Syngorn is gone.

513
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:42,502
LAURA: Don't say that.

514
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,714
TALIESIN: Millions dead.

515
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:48,684
LAURA: Millions. It's very large.

516
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:51,312
TRAVIS: Remember to shop at Gilmore's Ruined
Rubble.

517
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:52,740
(laughter)

518
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,750
SAM: Oh no, he didn't even get a new franchise
before it was--

519
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,242
TALIESIN: For all your reclaimed wood needs.

520
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:03,800
TRAVIS: Oh. Well done. Well done. That was nice.

521
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,030
TALIESIN: The best was watching Laura go, "Oh what
a great i-- ooh."

522
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,278
TRAVIS: And endless supply of pavers and gravel.

523
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,685
SAM: Gilmore's Building Supplies.

524
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,673
(laughter)

525
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:19,712
TRAVIS: All your home improvements.

526
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:23,862
MATT: Back to your regularly scheduled D&amp;D game.

527
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:31,395
SAM: What did you see, Keyleth?

528
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:42,419
MARISHA: Syngorn is gone. And I don't mean
destroyed, I don't mean burnt. I don't mean that

529
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:56,431
it's rubble, I mean it's gone. The city is gone.
There's, like, a huge chasm, a huge empty spot in

530
00:33:56,431 --> 00:34:00,981
the middle of the forest where Syngorn once lied.
Lie.

531
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:08,623
SAM: Lay. Did it look like it was destroyed to
nothing? Or transported somewhere?

532
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:18,350
MARISHA: Like that. Like transported, like the
city was lifted out of its place and was

533
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,637
teleported elsewhere.

534
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:33,417
SAM: Could it have been-- I don't know how your
scrying works-- could it have been some sort of a

535
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:36,786
magical block? Not real, an illusion of some
sort?

536
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:42,351
MATT: I would like Vax and Vex to both roll a
history check.

537
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:49,726
LAURA: Any kind of advantage on that? For growing
up there or something?

538
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,857
MATT: Nope, that's-- you get to roll this because
of that.

539
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,067
LIAM: History?

540
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:57,859
TALIESIN: Should have stayed in school.

541
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:02,651
LIAM: Didn't help.

542
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:04,207
LAURA: Eight.

543
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:05,454
LIAM: 15.

544
00:35:05,454 --> 00:35:06,764
MATT: Okay.

545
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:10,402
TALIESIN: Can I take a roll just for being a
nerd?

546
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,958
LIAM: All out of luck.

547
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,294
MATT: Are you proficient in history?

548
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:14,465
TALIESIN: I am proficient in history.

549
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:16,138
MATT: Sure, I'll let you roll.

550
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:24,400
TALIESIN: I want a nerd roll. 24. Book reading!

551
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:33,675
MATT: Okay. Being the astute researcher, the
indoor kid growing up. Yeah. There aren't a lot of

552
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:41,282
books that made their way north about pure elven
culture, especially wooded elves, that comprise

553
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:43,654
the entirety of the Syngorn nation.

554
00:35:43,654 --> 00:35:45,432
TALIESIN: I speak Elven, so that's good.

555
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:47,133
(laughter)

556
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:56,307
MATT: It has rarely come into play, but because of
previous wars, terrible devastation, and the need

557
00:35:56,307 --> 00:36:06,129
for the elvish culture to protect itself, and to
maintain its existence, you do know that there

558
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:16,174
have been instances of large enchantments on
places of cultural importance that would bridge

559
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:26,670
between here and the Feywild. And as a defense
mechanism, essentially, would cloak and/or shift

560
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,065
those locations.

561
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:32,653
TALIESIN: They've gone into hiding.

562
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:35,532
MARISHA: How can you be sure?

563
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:43,055
TALIESIN: I can't, but there's reason to believe
so. It's what it points to.

564
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:46,771
LIAM: What points to what? What are you talking
about?

565
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:54,701
TALIESIN: Historically, elves have, in times of
great stress, taken important sites, important

566
00:36:54,701 --> 00:37:01,701
places, people, and either cloaked them, hidden
them, or moved them into the Feywild until such

567
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:08,562
time as the danger has passed. There is precedence
for this. They've gone into hiding.

568
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:09,968
LAURA: Great.

569
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:13,179
LIAM: That's one more thing our father failed to
impart to us.

570
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:15,137
LAURA: (laughs cynically) At least he's safe.

571
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:19,124
TALIESIN: Most likely.

572
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:24,146
MARISHA: I need to check in on the Air Ashari. I'm
going to spend my last scrying.

573
00:37:24,146 --> 00:37:35,335
MATT: Okay. As your vision separates from your
current place of origin, you find yourself

574
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:43,040
drifting up into the clouds and speeding through
the air. The location itself is blurred, though

575
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,968
recalling the origin of where you originally came
from, you pass by columns of black smoke to your

576
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:55,084
left, you assume somewhere related to Westrunn's
current location.

577
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:56,411
MARISHA: Right.

578
00:37:56,411 --> 00:38:02,581
MATT: Eventually, the clouds part, and you find
yourself thrust down upon the earth amongst the

579
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:11,405
center of the Air Ashari tribe. You can see the
thin leather constructs that make up a portion of

580
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:21,052
your people's hovels and buildings. You can see
the nearby chasm-based windfall that pours through

581
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:26,247
constantly with a gentle whistling sound that
forever is marked as the chorus that guides you

582
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:36,259
all to sleep every evening. There, you can see
your people amongst various conversations, going

583
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:43,488
amongst their various daily duties, seemingly
untouched, unscathed, and unaware of what recent

584
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,277
events had transpired.

585
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:46,831
MARISHA: They're okay.

586
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:51,538
MATT: That is the last of your scrying capability
for the day.

587
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:58,736
TALIESIN: You didn't have to know that. Big girls
don't scry. Sorry, I saw it on Netflix.

588
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:04,390
LAURA: Wow. Wow. Hit after hit after hit today,
Taliesin.

589
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:09,065
LIAM: You know, just because you can, doesn't mean
you should.

590
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:11,929
TALIESIN: I know. I know. Coffee hasn't kicked in
yet.

591
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:21,312
MARISHA: All right, they're okay. They seem
unaware, which is very disheartening on a few

592
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:22,431
levels.

593
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:24,232
TALIESIN: Well, they'll know soon enough.

594
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:25,579
MARISHA: Exactly.

595
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:28,460
TALIESIN: We are going to need transport.

596
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,241
SAM: To where?

597
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:36,272
TALIESIN: Ah. I don't think we're going to win
this fight staying here, I think we're going to

598
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:43,223
have to rally power, I think we're going to have
to rally allies. I don't think there's enough here

599
00:39:43,223 --> 00:39:44,605
for us to win.

600
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:52,152
LAURA: Can we relocate all of the refugees staying
in our walls? Can we bring everyone through the

601
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:55,684
Sun Tree? Keyleth? How long does it stay open?

602
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,232
MARISHA: Six seconds.

603
00:39:57,232 --> 00:40:02,069
TALIESIN: We can go in shifts. This is not
something that's going to be solved tomorrow. We

604
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,273
can take a week, and move people.

605
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:08,016
LIAM: That's true. And there's 50 to 100 refugees,
you said, something like that, right?

606
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:11,789
MATT: At this point now, in your keep, surviving,
you're looking at the 30s.

607
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:13,036
LIAM: 30s?

608
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,507
SAM: But there's hundreds more inside the city
walls. Thousands.

609
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:19,434
TALIESIN: We're going-- we're not going to be able
to empty the city.

610
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:21,656
LAURA: But we can at least get these people out.

611
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:28,224
TALIESIN: We can get these people out. And we're
going to need-- and I apologise for the brightness

612
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:32,189
in my voice-- I think we're going to need an
airship.

613
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:36,639
LAURA: An airship sounds wonderful, Percy, but--

614
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,187
LIAM: You mean like the one that crashed?

615
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,657
TALIESIN: Like the one that crashed.

616
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:42,697
LAURA: One dragon attacking it and it's down.

617
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:46,782
TALIESIN: We're going to need to move quickly,
though, from city to city, and we're going to need

618
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:48,013
to get word.

619
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:52,660
MARISHA: Well, moving quickly from city to city--
I don't know.

620
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,314
TALIESIN: We may have to steal an airship or
something.

621
00:40:55,314 --> 00:40:57,482
SAM: You're going to steal a plane?

622
00:40:57,482 --> 00:41:00,840
TALIESIN: I'm making a plan. I'm thinking of a
plan.

623
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,174
LAURA: You keep thinking, there.

624
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,290
TALIESIN: It's working.

625
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:09,284
MARISHA: Well, I mean, I've recently discovered
that that misty Wind Walk spell that I cast on all

626
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:16,231
of us is not great for battle, but is great for
travel. And that lasts for eight hours.

627
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:17,946
SAM: What does? Who?

628
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:21,713
MARISHA: Remember how I failed and almost killed
us all?

629
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:24,093
TRAVIS: Shit the bed. Yeah.

630
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:31,679
MARISHA: Yeah. Thanks, Grog. What I learned out of
that was it's not great for battle, but it is

631
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:38,348
great for travel. It lasts for eight hours. We can
move 300 feet per second.

632
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:43,383
LAURA: Wonderful. We get the refugees out, we go
to Whitestone, we talk to them there, we use the

633
00:41:43,383 --> 00:41:49,138
Misty Walk thingy and go to Vasselheim, talk to
the Slayer's Take. This is perfect. Problem--

634
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:53,743
SAM: Are we going to check in with the Clasp? I
really like Percy's idea about stealing a plane.

635
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:55,548
I'm just throwing that out there.

636
00:41:55,548 --> 00:42:00,327
TALIESIN: There is an empty airdock that's
currently not being used in the city.

637
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:05,789
LAURA: Do we need a ship right now, darling? I
understand the joy in it.

638
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,455
TALIESIN: We don't need it now, but we're going to
be-- need to move--

639
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:14,237
SAM: We could take all of these refugees with us.
Don't you understand? We would be helping

640
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:15,322
humanity.

641
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:16,973
MARISHA: I'm with Vex. You all honestly--

642
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:21,800
LAURA: -- believe a dragon wouldn't notice a giant
airship flying out of the city?

643
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,465
SAM: Not if we hide it with some-- some
smokescreen action of some sort.

644
00:42:25,465 --> 00:42:30,375
LIAM: Guys. This is an RPG, not a JRPG.

645
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,045
(laughter)

646
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:34,383
TALIESIN: I want to live like Teddy Ruxpin. This
is all I've ever wanted.

647
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:37,230
(laughter)

648
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,374
LAURA: We need to talk to the Clasp first.

649
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:42,922
SAM: All right, let's go talk to the Clasp. We'll
ask them what they think about--

650
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:46,376
LAURA: Plus Allura and Drake are coming back. We
need to talk to them as well. Find out what's

651
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:49,097
going on in Westrunn. And then we need to get
everyone out.

652
00:42:49,097 --> 00:43:00,808
MARISHA: I can transport some of us via plants
today. I will have to sleep if we want and study

653
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:02,717
to do the Misty Step again.

654
00:43:02,717 --> 00:43:04,037
LAURA: I've got a plan.

655
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:06,141
TALIESIN: We have time. This is not a one-day
plan.

656
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:08,101
LAURA: Here's a good plan. This is a good plan,
though.

657
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:09,379
LIAM: Here it comes, everybody.

658
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:12,038
LAURA: Open up the tree. Send a bunch of refugees
through.

659
00:43:12,038 --> 00:43:13,153
MARISHA: Shove a bunch in.

660
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:18,465
LAURA: Shove them through as fast as possible.
Percy. You go with them. We keep the stone. You go

661
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:21,923
through. You talk to your sister. You bamf back
with the stone.

662
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:27,308
MARISHA: Let Whitestone know what's going on.
Because they're going to freak out if like--

663
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:29,312
LAURA: And then we talk to the Clasp together.

664
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:30,802
TALIESIN: I think that's a good plan.

665
00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:35,460
MARISHA: They will freak out if 20 refugees pour
out of the Sun Tree. And they have no context.

666
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,814
TRAVIS: Do that first.

667
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:42,730
MARISHA: Okay. So wait, are you going to go on
your mission while we go talk to the Clasp?

668
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:48,239
LAURA: No, we're going to wait for you. So can we
get the refugees together?

669
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,620
MATT: All right, so as you go into the temple and
get Pike's attention, you begin to round up the

670
00:43:53,620 --> 00:44:00,123
refugees, which as a statement, historically, is
already unnerving. You begin to push them all

671
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:02,332
together in a group and tell them what?

672
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:09,663
LAURA: Well, we comfort them and tell them: all
right, obviously Emon is not a safe place to be

673
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:10,657
right now.

674
00:44:10,657 --> 00:44:12,357
MATT: "No, that's true, that's true! It's terrible
here!"

675
00:44:12,357 --> 00:44:16,814
LAURA: It's dangerous, and we want to keep all of
you as safe as possible.

676
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:20,344
MATT: "Yes, and thank you for taking us." Everyone
starts cheering.

677
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:21,709
LAURA: We have a plan.

678
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:24,644
SAM: We probably can only take a few. It should be
women and children.

679
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:31,742
LAURA: We're going to take those of you who need
the most attention first, and we're going to bring

680
00:44:31,742 --> 00:44:37,918
you to Whitestone, which is a city that has not
been affected by dragons at all. It has much need

681
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:44,453
of people who can do an honest day's labor, and
you can earn a wage and find a living there, for

682
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:48,416
the time being, and if at some point in time you
want to come back to Emon when all of this is

683
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:51,040
done, of course you're more than welcome to.

684
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,549
LIAM: There is opportunity.

685
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:55,074
MARISHA: And no dragons!

686
00:44:55,074 --> 00:44:56,653
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

687
00:44:56,653 --> 00:45:06,142
LAURA: I'm rolling the gold one! 20?

688
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:12,448
MATT: Okay! A couple of folks currently,
(muttering) "I've never been to Whitestone! Is it cold?"

689
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,542
LAURA: In the winter.

690
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:16,177
MATT: "It's winter!"

691
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:20,011
LAURA: Then it could be a little chilly!

692
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:23,797
SAM: Bundle up! We'll give you some wool blankets
for the trip!

693
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:25,195
MATT: "Okay?"

694
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:27,703
LIAM: There's definitely no vampires there. None.

695
00:45:27,703 --> 00:45:31,801
MATT: A couple of kids go, "Vampires, sir?"

696
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:35,085
LAURA: I like that we're sending to them to the
place that's got the orb of death.

697
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:39,935
MATT: "What was that? What'd you say?"

698
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:41,375
SAM: No, nothing, she didn't say anything.

699
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,955
LAURA: I said, "You might be able to see your
breath!"

700
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:48,855
MATT: "Winter! Right! Okay, let's grab our
things!" And some of the folks start getting their

701
00:45:48,855 --> 00:45:52,598
things together. Packing up their things-- what
they had on their back, essentially, as they

702
00:45:52,598 --> 00:45:58,586
rushed here. Shake a few out of their shell-shock,
and they all gather up towards the center of the

703
00:45:58,586 --> 00:46:00,339
Temple of Sarenrae.

704
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:04,810
LAURA: Percy-- stone. To go through the--

705
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,223
TALIESIN: I already gave it to Keyleth.

706
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:07,528
LAURA: Oh, okay.

707
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:12,167
MARISHA: DM question? How many do you think I can
fit through in six seconds?

708
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,349
MATT: We'll find out!

709
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,993
MARISHA: If I put them in like a line, and we're
like, "Go! Go! Go!"

710
00:46:15,993 --> 00:46:19,254
MATT: That's up to you guys! How do you want to do
this?

711
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:22,321
LIAM: They can't get-- no one can get cut in half,
can they?

712
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:26,252
LAURA: Well I assume, as soon as we see it
start to shrink, we stop! We cut off the line.

713
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:33,073
MARISHA: Well, what we should do-- here's the
thing that I'm worried about. We don't want, like,

714
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:36,301
a kid to go through, and then they get separated
from their mom.

715
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:40,046
TRAVIS: Well, everybody's got to grow up at some
point.

716
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:42,216
LAURA: Anybody with children. How many children
are here?

717
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,154
MATT: I'd say you have seven children.

718
00:46:44,154 --> 00:46:48,211
LAURA: Children with their moms go-- and families
go first.

719
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:51,956
LIAM: Well, we were saying that the terribly
injured, the people with the worst injuries--

720
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:53,917
LAURA: All right, those people first!

721
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,489
LIAM: Yeah, those people first.

722
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:57,233
TRAVIS: Yeah, because they'll go through real
fast.

723
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:00,688
LIAM: And then with kids-- But they need attention
now! They need--

724
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:03,862
SAM: Hey! We're going to be doing this every day
for several days.

725
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:08,473
TALIESIN: Hey, I've got a weird theory. Let's not
send people with injuries yet, so that perhaps

726
00:47:08,473 --> 00:47:11,270
Pike can stay here and take care of them for a
little bit?

727
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,453
LAURA: Oh! Good call, okay! So the injured can
stay.

728
00:47:13,453 --> 00:47:16,822
TRAVIS: Can't we put them on a wagon? Can't we like
put them on a wagon, down and like--

729
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:19,282
TALIESIN: We don't want to lose a wagon to
Whitestone.

730
00:47:19,282 --> 00:47:22,058
SAM: This is just how Schindler did it, by the
way.

731
00:47:22,058 --> 00:47:23,975
LAURA: What!?

732
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:30,008
SAM: He debated it for a while, and then--
(nervous laughter).

733
00:47:30,008 --> 00:47:33,817
LIAM: No words! No words!

734
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,911
TRAVIS: And the room goes silent, and the mug
comes up.

735
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:40,127
LAURA: Okay. So not the injured.

736
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:43,969
Families first. How about that?

737
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:48,120
TALIESIN: We'll count to six, and then we'll put
the rope down, and when we hit six, we pull the

738
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,174
rope, and it'll hold everybody--

739
00:47:50,174 --> 00:47:51,773
SAM: Wait, there's a rope?

740
00:47:51,773 --> 00:47:54,435
LAURA: As soon as we see it start to shrink, I'll
hold the people back.

741
00:47:54,435 --> 00:47:55,726
TALIESIN: Yes, hold the people back.

742
00:47:55,726 --> 00:48:00,094
LAURA: So Percy, you're first, everybody follow
through. So any families here? Families?

743
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:04,141
MATT: Some of the kids raise their hands, some
adults go over and they grab kids' hands and stand

744
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:05,613
next to them. "Yes."

745
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:10,410
LAURA: Are you really respons-- I can tell when
you're lying, sir. Are you responsible for that child?

746
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,507
MATT: Make an insight check.

747
00:48:12,507 --> 00:48:17,408
LAURA: 26!

748
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:22,394
MATT: Ha! Two of those people are definitely just
taking a kid's hand in hopes of getting through first.

749
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:26,407
TRAVIS: I walk in and start cracking my knuckles
behind Vex.

750
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:30,419
MATT: "Well, I mean, I can wait, no worries!
Eh--"

751
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:32,709
LAURA: Child, where's your parents? Do you have
one?

752
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,979
MATT: "They haven't shown up yet."

753
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,373
LAURA: Oh, dear.

754
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:39,280
SAM: Leave them here, in case the parents come.

755
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,994
LAURA: Okay. Then you would stay and wait for your
family, potentially?

756
00:48:42,994 --> 00:48:44,915
LIAM: You can stay with Pike, for now.

757
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:49,215
MATT: Pike comes over and pats him on the
shoulder. They're the same height, so it's easy.

758
00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:56,645
MARISHA: Let's do completed full families who are
comfortable relocating.

759
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:58,327
LAURA: That can move. Here we go.

760
00:48:58,327 --> 00:49:01,843
MATT: Altogether, completed full families, there
are two.

761
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:03,103
MARISHA: How many people?

762
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:04,236
MATT: It'd be a total of eight people.

763
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:05,457
LAURA: That's good! That's a good amount!

764
00:49:05,457 --> 00:49:07,824
TRAVIS: Yeah, think about it! One one thousand,
one one thousand--

765
00:49:07,824 --> 00:49:10,157
LAURA: And then, any other like single people that
can move fast?

766
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,445
MARISHA: Yeah, a couple single people? To bring up
the rear?

767
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:16,620
MATT: Okay. You have about ten more people that
raise their hands.

768
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,456
TALIESIN: We can get that many through in six
seconds.

769
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,984
SAM: What are you talking about?

770
00:49:19,984 --> 00:49:21,583
LAURA: Get ready to run, people.

771
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:27,320
MARISHA: All right. So let's go to the tree.
Percy, you're going to lead. Percy, you're going

772
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:35,452
to lead. We're going to put the eight up front,
with the ten, 15 stragglers behind. I tell them

773
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:44,499
all: all right. As soon as you see that tree start
to part, run! Run your face off! I tell that to

774
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:46,005
the crowd.

775
00:49:46,005 --> 00:49:49,695
TALIESIN: And keep running. So that you make room
for everyone behind you, we don't want like-- it's

776
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:53,976
not the bottom of an escalator. Whatever that is.
It's a thing I've been working on, it's going to

777
00:49:53,976 --> 00:49:54,889
be great.

778
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:58,580
MARISHA: Don't stop in the tree, you will create
terrible congestion.

779
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,226
LAURA: Everybody comfortable with the plan?

780
00:50:00,226 --> 00:50:02,257
SAM: Can I inspire Keyleth for this?

781
00:50:02,257 --> 00:50:03,500
MATT: Sure.

782
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:12,670
SAM: Okay, I will perform a limerick for her to
inspire her. I know an airheaded young druid /

783
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:19,113
whose plans are more gassy than fluid / when the
battle starts / she turns her pals into farts /

784
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:21,977
they see danger and pass right through it!

785
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:29,698
MARISHA: Thank you, Scanlan. I love it. It's so
like me.

786
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:33,262
MATT: Take a 1d10 inspiration die.

787
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:40,060
TRAVIS: I hate to be the detail-oriented one about
this whole thing, but should somebody be counting

788
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,508
as soon as she starts so we put down an arm at
six?

789
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:46,218
LAURA: You count in your head, Grog.

790
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:47,826
TRAVIS: You really don't want me to do that.

791
00:50:47,826 --> 00:50:52,017
MARISHA: Maybe with my inspiration, I can get a
few more seconds in there?

792
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:58,410
MATT: We shall see. I'll say for the sake of this,
go ahead and roll a wisdom check.

793
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,850
MARISHA: Oh boy.

794
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,530
MATT: A d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

795
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,002
MARISHA: Oh, that's not good.

796
00:51:06,002 --> 00:51:07,829
SAM: You've got inspiration if you need it.

797
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:09,376
MARISHA: Can I add my inspiration to this?

798
00:51:09,376 --> 00:51:10,782
MATT: Go for it.

799
00:51:10,782 --> 00:51:17,372
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. That helps a lot. What
am I adding? Just my straight wisdom?

800
00:51:17,372 --> 00:51:18,867
MATT: Yep, wisdom modifier.

801
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,932
MARISHA: My modifier? 19 total.

802
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:26,425
MATT: 19 total, okay. So as you all gather around
in the center of the temple, Keyleth, you step up

803
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:31,831
to the outside of one of the two front trees to
the temple, one of the ones you guys usually use

804
00:51:31,831 --> 00:51:37,797
to transport to and from here. As you focus in and
reach your hand out and touch the outside of the

805
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:45,161
tree's bark, with a rough tearing sound, the tree
bark widens into an oval-shaped doorway that is

806
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:52,180
immediately visible. On the opposite side, you can
see before you a lightly snow-dappled landscape

807
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,133
that is the central market of Whitestone.

808
00:51:54,133 --> 00:51:56,530
LAURA: We put blankets on everybody, right?

809
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,994
MATT: From what you had.

810
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:03,671
MARISHA: Go! Go! Now, run, go! Go, Percy, go!

811
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:04,904
MATT: Who's pushing?

812
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:06,554
TALIESIN: I'm already through.

813
00:52:06,554 --> 00:52:09,755
MATT: Percy's through. All right, are you guys just
letting them go at their own rate?

814
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:12,439
TRAVIS: (shouting) Move your fucking asses!

815
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:14,194
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

816
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:17,382
MARISHA: It's like a football line.

817
00:52:17,382 --> 00:52:18,847
TRAVIS: 17.

818
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:23,203
MATT: 17. With that, everyone goes, (startled
noise) and starts charging through wildly. The

819
00:52:23,203 --> 00:52:24,769
crowd starts pushing through.

820
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:27,826
MARISHA: I'm trying to hold it.

821
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:30,451
LIAM: No severed limbs, no whammies!

822
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:36,930
MATT: Okay. All of the rest-- the family people go
through, the young folks push through. You manage

823
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,719
to get a total of 23 people through.

824
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,525
(cheering)

825
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:47,642
MATT: Some folks who weren't even planning to go
on this were so driven by the sudden shouting Grog

826
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:55,742
voice echoing from behind that they charged
forward Black Friday-style, and managed to escape

827
00:52:55,742 --> 00:53:01,045
the tail end of the spell tapering the doorway
off.

828
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,591
LIAM: "I regret nothing!"

829
00:53:03,591 --> 00:53:05,662
SAM: Well, I hope Percy comes back soon.

830
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:08,009
MARISHA: I've got the gatestone.

831
00:53:08,009 --> 00:53:09,367
MATT: Percy?

832
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:13,693
TALIESIN: I'm going to get everybody organized.
Everyone, please follow me. We're heading towards

833
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:15,393
the main castle.

834
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,190
MATT: They're all looking around.

835
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,876
TALIESIN: Welcome to Whitestone.

836
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:24,657
MATT: A gentle snowfall is coming down. The sky
itself you can see is covered in light, white

837
00:53:24,657 --> 00:53:29,381
clouds. Just enough moisture to carry the little
snowfall that's happening. There are folks in the

838
00:53:29,381 --> 00:53:34,682
center of the town that are surprised to see this
arrival, but recognize you and cheer a little bit.

839
00:53:34,682 --> 00:53:36,297
"Hey! Percival."

840
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,699
(laughter)

841
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:44,200
TALIESIN: Thank you for that smattering of
applause. Golf claps, please. Golf claps.

842
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,613
MATT: The refugees all gather up behind you, and
you guys walk towards Castle Whitestone.

843
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:50,368
TALIESIN: We make our way to the castle.

844
00:53:50,368 --> 00:53:54,835
MATT: The guards greet you and lead you inside.
And within a few minutes, Cassandra comes down

845
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:58,554
from the upper floor. "Percival, you've
returned."

846
00:53:58,554 --> 00:54:04,889
TALIESIN: Things are not going well. Have you
heard any news of Emon and what has been

847
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:06,287
transpiring there?

848
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:10,599
MATT: "No, we've been focused on restoring our
city. Why?"

849
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:22,837
TALIESIN: Yesterday, we were attacked by a group
of chromatic dragons. The city is destroyed.

850
00:54:22,837 --> 00:54:32,378
There's no simple way to say this, but we're under
siege. We were afraid that Whitestone would be

851
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:39,969
destroyed, as well, but it seems that they have
passed over you so far, but we fear for many

852
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:49,581
cities' safety. I was hoping that it would be all
right if we moved a small number of refugees

853
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:57,817
through to Whitestone for the time being. Less
than a hundred, I imagine. These are the first

854
00:54:57,817 --> 00:55:00,535
20-some-odd that we've pulled through.

855
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:04,423
MATT: And she looks behind you, looks to the
crowd, snaps her fingers. Some of the guards step

856
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:05,693
forward, she goes,

857
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:10,655
"Please, if you would make sure to find any of the
various unoccupied buildings are provided to these

858
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:12,371
"refugees. Thank you."

859
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:15,942
And the guards nod, and begin gathering the group
and sending them back into town, and she gives you

860
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:17,449
a look back and says,

861
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:23,018
"For better or for worse, we happen to have a
number of vacancies in the city due to recent

862
00:55:23,018 --> 00:55:24,367
"events. But--"

863
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:28,952
TALIESIN: Oh! Well, yes. Nothing I-- Anything I
should know about?

864
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:36,400
MATT: "No, just-- We've lost many in the struggle
against the Briarwoods. But yes, they will be

865
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,839
"provided for, I assure you."

866
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:43,011
TALIESIN: So I will let you know to stop all
business with Emon for now. Be very wary, prepare

867
00:55:43,011 --> 00:55:50,656
the city for a possible dragon attack. Things are
looking dark.

868
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:52,200
MATT: "Yes, yes."

869
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:00,832
TALIESIN: And if it's possible, any research-- any
energy that can be put forward towards mounting

870
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:04,805
some sort of defense against these creatures would
be greatly appreciated.

871
00:56:04,805 --> 00:56:13,334
MATT: "Right, right, well, we had a few
individuals that were researching the ziggurat

872
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:17,808
"beneath the city. Two left a while back and we had
one arrive just the other day."

873
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,898
TALIESIN: Who arrived the other day?

874
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:28,283
MATT: "I cannot recall his name-- Realm
Seeker, Realm Seer-- I'm not--"

875
00:56:28,283 --> 00:56:30,126
LAURA: (whispering) Eskil Ryndarien!

876
00:56:30,126 --> 00:56:33,374
TALIESIN: Please bring me to him.

877
00:56:33,374 --> 00:56:40,834
MATT: All right, Cassandra leads you down into the
city again, and one of the houses has been

878
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:46,133
provided, she knocks on the door, the door opens and
you see stepping out, an older gentleman who

879
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:52,311
you've heard of but not really had an encounter
with since-- no, actually you encountered him for

880
00:56:52,311 --> 00:56:56,583
the final ritual that took the phylactery from
Grog's chest.

881
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,789
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

882
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:04,113
MATT: But this is Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, the
archmage that basically was one of the folks who

883
00:57:04,113 --> 00:57:08,042
lived within Westruun and was called to Whitestone
as part of research--

884
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:10,280
TALIESIN: That's some pre-stream stuff,
everybody.

885
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,195
MATT: As the door opens, he comes out, eyes
adjusting to the light, and you can see the

886
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:19,209
interior is very dark. He's one of those
live-in-lightless-territory types of person. Comes

887
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:24,448
out with his round spectacles around his nose, his
robe is disheveled, bundled over his shoulders, he

888
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:27,022
goes, "Yes, if I may be of service--?"

889
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:30,261
TALIESIN: We've met! You look very familiar.

890
00:57:30,261 --> 00:57:35,993
MATT: "Quite! Yes we have. You're with those
S.H.I.T.s, weren't you?"

891
00:57:35,993 --> 00:57:40,584
TALIESIN: (laughing) Ah, yes.

892
00:57:40,584 --> 00:57:42,209
MATT: "Unfortunate title you've chosen--"

893
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,020
TALIESIN: Long gone, thankfully, long gone. We're
Vox Machina--

894
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,523
MATT: "Good! Vox Machina, glad you took my
suggestion."

895
00:57:46,523 --> 00:57:48,307
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you for that.

896
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:50,142
(laughing)

897
00:57:50,142 --> 00:57:52,511
MATT: "What can I do for you?"

898
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,261
TALIESIN: Well, first of all, how goes the
research into the--

899
00:57:55,261 --> 00:58:01,788
MATT: "Frustrating, to say the least. It appears
that this entire--" and he walks back into the

900
00:58:01,788 --> 00:58:05,475
house, expecting you guys to follow. As you enter,
immediately you're hit with the smell of sage and

901
00:58:05,475 --> 00:58:09,811
other burning herbs, and you can see there's a
vast number of books that are strewn about the

902
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:17,013
table in front. The fireplace in the back is
pouring smoke up into the roof area and soot's starting

903
00:58:17,013 --> 00:58:21,119
to gather on the stonework on the outside. Looks
like there's two or three different kettles going

904
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:27,409
off with different types of tea. It's complete
chaos in here, but he seems to be in control of

905
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:36,992
most of it, at least. He goes, "From best we can
ascertain, this is some sort of a magical siphon

906
00:58:36,992 --> 00:58:45,370
"device. It has prevented us from utilizing any
sort of ritualistic endeavors in ascertaining its

907
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:53,026
"nature, it's quite perplexing. I'm hoping to
either head over to Wildemount, or perhaps return

908
00:58:53,026 --> 00:58:59,140
"to the Cobalt Reserve and perhaps find some
historical information about such an object, but

909
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,560
"nothing in my current--"

910
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,710
TALIESIN: Well, sir, I have some bad news for you.
I hail from Emon, which has been attacked by

911
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,183
chromatic dragons--

912
00:59:08,183 --> 00:59:11,079
MATT: "I'm sorry, what?"

913
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:18,542
TALIESIN: Dragons have declared war on
civilization. A group of dragons have destroyed

914
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:28,793
our city, and they have destroyed other cities as
well. We are in desperate need of powers to defend

915
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:37,650
ourselves with-- So I would be very careful and
send forward-- Send word ahead of yourself before

916
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,915
you travel anywhere, it may not be there by the
time you get there.

917
00:59:40,915 --> 00:59:46,791
MATT: "Well, I guess it's good that I moved my
tower before I left."

918
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:52,571
TALIESIN: Things are looking grim and I would ask
while you-- If you intend to remain and work on

919
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:59,686
your research on this anomaly beneath our city,
perhaps thinking as to how it may be turned into a

920
00:59:59,686 --> 01:00:07,788
weapon for our use against these creatures would
not be out of the realm of question, and any

921
01:00:07,788 --> 01:00:13,082
information you do have of the chromatic dragons
would be invaluable. Any research that can be

922
01:00:13,082 --> 01:00:16,207
done. We are at war.

923
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:24,646
MATT: "This is very disconcerting news. I will do
what I can. Unfortunately, I'd have to get back to

924
01:00:24,646 --> 01:00:28,889
"the Cobalt Reserve. That's where most of my
research is completed."

925
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:30,598
TALIESIN: That's Westruun?

926
01:00:30,598 --> 01:00:35,937
MATT: "Let me see. Jeckt--" And he snaps his
fingers, and you can see his manservant, Jeckt,

927
01:00:35,937 --> 01:00:45,073
who you've met before, slicked-back darkish red
hair, mustache, very prim and proper-type

928
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:47,533
manservant, well-dressed, steps out of the
shadows.

929
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:49,293
"Yes, my lord?"

930
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:54,890
"If you would be so kind, prepare me for travel,
pack up this--"

931
01:00:54,890 --> 01:01:01,498
TALIESIN: Westruun is no more, sir.

932
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:04,484
MATT: "Well, that's really frustrating!"

933
01:01:04,484 --> 01:01:06,313
TALIESIN: Yes.

934
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:07,408
MATT: "Really."

935
01:01:07,408 --> 01:01:08,877
TALIESIN: Extremely aggravating.

936
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:14,115
MATT: "Yes. I am unhappy with this circumstance!
How am I supposed to do my research without a

937
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:15,674
"place to do my research?!"

938
01:01:15,674 --> 01:01:22,141
TALIESIN: Well, we hope that you will find our
winters here quite solitary, and convenient on

939
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:25,820
that level. Things are looking grim.

940
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,241
MATT: "Well, you can say that again."

941
01:01:28,241 --> 01:01:32,404
TALIESIN: I must go. I have other work to do to
start preparing--

942
01:01:32,404 --> 01:01:33,813
TRAVIS: Peace!

943
01:01:33,813 --> 01:01:38,666
MATT: "Yes, yes go! Do your thing!"

944
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:41,090
TALIESIN: Good day, sir. And good luck to you.

945
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:45,865
MATT: "Should I find anything, how will I--
whereabouts-- Where are you?"

946
01:01:45,865 --> 01:01:49,305
TALIESIN: We don't know yet, but we will be
returning here.

947
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,677
MATT: "That does not help me. I will do my best."

948
01:01:52,677 --> 01:01:55,216
TALIESIN: Cassandra will be able to get a hold of
me if necessary.

949
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:57,858
MATT: "Ah, Cassandra. All right! Someone of use
around here."

950
01:01:57,858 --> 01:02:01,260
TALIESIN: I am going to go find my sister and make
my way to the stone.

951
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:06,503
MATT: He doesn't even say goodbye to you. He's
completely flustered. It's funny. For everyone

952
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:12,431
who's taken completely by the horror of the
situation, he just seems really perturbed about the--

953
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:14,133
TRAVIS: Inconvenience of it all.

954
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:16,460
MATT: Yeah, it's so inconvenient. That library was
very helpful.

955
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,708
TALIESIN: Why isn't the internet working!
(frustrated noise)

956
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:24,781
MATT: Basically. You find your way to Cassandra
again. She's waiting outside of the room. "I hope

957
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:26,014
"he's been helpful, brother"

958
01:02:26,014 --> 01:02:30,632
TALIESIN: No, he wasn't helpful, but it was very
helpful the way he wasn't helpful.

959
01:02:30,632 --> 01:02:31,739
MATT: "Yes."

960
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:33,126
TALIESIN: It's a strange, strange--

961
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:34,672
MATT: "He's a very strange man."

962
01:02:34,672 --> 01:02:36,174
TALIESIN: Everything's going to be all right.

963
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:37,460
MATT: "I hope so."

964
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:44,014
TALIESIN: Thank you. I will return very soon. We
will, again with your permission, hopefully be

965
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:47,158
using Whitestone as a place to regroup and prepare
ourselves.

966
01:02:47,158 --> 01:02:54,290
MATT: "Is there worry that these dragons might
come here?"

967
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:55,709
TALIESIN: Yes.

968
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:58,661
MATT: "How will we stop them?"

969
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:18,740
TALIESIN: You'll hide. I have thoughts, perhaps of
a weapon. I don't know. But we're going to find a

970
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,201
way to stop them.

971
01:03:20,201 --> 01:03:21,696
MATT: "We have to."

972
01:03:21,696 --> 01:03:27,614
TALIESIN: I'm not good at being the bearer of any
bad news, but this is very dangerous and I don't

973
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:30,168
know what we're going to do.

974
01:03:30,168 --> 01:03:31,413
SAM: (whispers) Steal an airplane.

975
01:03:31,413 --> 01:03:32,540
MATT: "Neither do I."

976
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,538
TALIESIN: (whispers) They don't have an airplane.

977
01:03:34,538 --> 01:03:36,806
MATT: "Stay safe, Percival."

978
01:03:36,806 --> 01:03:38,572
TALIESIN: I shall return soon.

979
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:43,618
MATT: "I hope so. We'll do what we can in the
meantime to see to your refugees and hopefully try

980
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:45,013
"and prepare ourselves."

981
01:03:45,013 --> 01:03:47,531
TALIESIN: There will be a few more through,
possibly tomorrow, with word.

982
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:49,210
MATT: "All right. We'll be prepared. Thank you."

983
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:55,349
She reaches out and puts her hand on yours, again,
and looks you sternly in the face and goes, "Be careful."

984
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:56,778
TALIESIN: I will.

985
01:03:56,778 --> 01:03:58,349
MATT: "You're all I have left."

986
01:03:58,349 --> 01:04:02,386
TALIESIN: And Cassandra, I'm proud of you. You're
doing very well here.

987
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:05,163
MATT: "There's still a ways to go, brother."

988
01:04:05,163 --> 01:04:06,719
TALIESIN: We'll get there.

989
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:14,992
MATT: She hands you the gatestone. And with that,
there's a slight popping sound as you're in a very

990
01:04:14,992 --> 01:04:20,993
soft bit of bluish-purple light. Your body slowly
subsides and fades into nothing before it (poof)

991
01:04:20,993 --> 01:04:27,888
vanishes out of existence. As you guys are back at
the keep, suddenly, who has the gatestone? As

992
01:04:27,888 --> 01:04:31,990
you're holding it, it begins to shake in your hand
and give off a warm light.

993
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,966
MARISHA: I think our reservation's ready.

994
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:38,311
SAM: I'm telling the, what, seven remaining
refugees?

995
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:41,950
MATT: You have about eight or nine.

996
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:47,657
SAM: Sorry you didn't make it through. It doesn't
mean that you'll be here forever. We'll get you

997
01:04:47,657 --> 01:04:50,012
there tomorrow. No big. Don't worry about it.

998
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:52,211
LAURA: More food for you guys, which is A+.

999
01:04:52,211 --> 01:05:02,896
MATT: At which point now, there's a slight smell
of burnt cedar before the air itself begins to

1000
01:05:02,896 --> 01:05:09,299
sound like a light hum or vibration as suddenly
Percy's form (poof) appears in the center of the

1001
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:13,123
room next to your gatestone. Both of the stones
you guys are holding all of a sudden become

1002
01:05:13,123 --> 01:05:15,382
white-hot, and you instinctively drop them before
they tumble to the ground.

1003
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:17,365
LAURA: Hey! They work!

1004
01:05:17,365 --> 01:05:21,094
TALIESIN: They hurt. Good to know.

1005
01:05:21,094 --> 01:05:23,588
SAM: That's great. Did you see your sister?

1006
01:05:23,588 --> 01:05:28,465
TALIESIN: I did, everything is fine up there, the
research continues. They're happy to take people.

1007
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:29,928
LAURA: That's wonderful.

1008
01:05:29,928 --> 01:05:35,916
TALIESIN: So, and they are prepared for more.
They're also happy to be a base of operations as

1009
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,223
we put things together.

1010
01:05:37,223 --> 01:05:40,338
LAURA: And you told them to make preparations in
case something happens?

1011
01:05:40,338 --> 01:05:44,823
TALIESIN: Whatever preparations one can make for
something like this, to be prepared to hide.

1012
01:05:44,823 --> 01:05:48,185
(sighs) For now.

1013
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:52,436
LIAM: In the worst-case scenario they can go
underground.

1014
01:05:52,436 --> 01:05:56,529
TALIESIN: Worst-case scenario, they can go
underground, yes.

1015
01:05:56,529 --> 01:05:58,129
LAURA: They need to start hiding food.

1016
01:05:58,129 --> 01:06:05,331
TALIESIN: They have to grow food, they haven't
really recovered that yet. There's also a--

1017
01:06:05,331 --> 01:06:07,255
MARISHA: Hopefully I hooked them up there.

1018
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:11,518
TALIESIN: I have one of those terrible ideas I get
on occasion.

1019
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:13,175
SAM: What is it? I love it.

1020
01:06:13,175 --> 01:06:16,835
TALIESIN: That thing beneath Whitestone could be a
weapon.

1021
01:06:16,835 --> 01:06:17,861
SAM: How?

1022
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:19,269
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's true.

1023
01:06:19,269 --> 01:06:20,918
LAURA: Anything touching it disintegrates.

1024
01:06:20,918 --> 01:06:22,599
TRAVIS: Yeah! Like a dragon.

1025
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:25,925
SAM: Do you shoot it at something?

1026
01:06:25,925 --> 01:06:27,853
TALIESIN: I might be able to turn it into a
projectile.

1027
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:30,028
LAURA: How would you turn it to a projectile-- are
you okay, Keyleth?

1028
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,522
LIAM: It is a fun idea--

1029
01:06:31,522 --> 01:06:33,516
TALIESIN: A long-term idea.

1030
01:06:33,516 --> 01:06:35,058
MARISHA: Just choking on Percy's idea.

1031
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:37,332
TALIESIN: I can make an antimagic missile.

1032
01:06:37,332 --> 01:06:42,063
MARISHA: What-- a magic-- a magic missile? An
antimagic missile?

1033
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:43,840
TALIESIN: An antimagic missile.

1034
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,641
LIAM: One plus one plus two plus one.

1035
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:46,903
LAURA: One plus two plus one plus one!

1036
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:49,778
SAM: That's a great idea.

1037
01:06:49,778 --> 01:06:52,221
TALIESIN: I've been-- I've been mulling it over.

1038
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:55,800
SAM: Could we fire it from an airship of some
sort?

1039
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,794
TALIESIN: Yes, I have-- that's actually part of
the idea.

1040
01:06:57,794 --> 01:07:06,419
MARISHA: Percy, when I tried to touch that thing
it was like it was sucking me in. I don't think

1041
01:07:06,419 --> 01:07:10,932
that thing and me touched. How are we going to
turn it into a projectile?

1042
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:14,501
TALIESIN: I have thoughts, I'm going to follow
them through, and it may require some

1043
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:17,446
experimentation in the future, but I think
perhaps--

1044
01:07:17,446 --> 01:07:20,480
MARISHA: At the cost of possibly your life?

1045
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:29,648
TALIESIN: I take my life into my hands any time I
build something. I think that a non-magical

1046
01:07:29,648 --> 01:07:33,585
approach to containing it might actually work. I
think the problem is--

1047
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:35,596
LAURA: Well that's good, because it cancels out
any magic--

1048
01:07:35,596 --> 01:07:38,579
TALIESIN: I think the problem is that we keep
trying to magic our way out of something that

1049
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:41,806
denies magic, and maybe I can engineer our way out
of it.

1050
01:07:41,806 --> 01:07:44,645
MARISHA: Have they found anything out, did you get
any updates?

1051
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:49,062
TALIESIN: A little bit of information, there will
be more later. I'm going to take a look at all

1052
01:07:49,062 --> 01:07:51,029
the data and see if it's possible.

1053
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:52,604
SAM: Should we go visit the Clasp?

1054
01:07:52,604 --> 01:07:55,080
TRAVIS: Oh, please.

1055
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,051
TALIESIN: I'm trying to be more open.

1056
01:07:57,051 --> 01:08:00,226
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go!

1057
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:01,749
MARISHA: What time is it?

1058
01:08:01,749 --> 01:08:07,711
MATT: At this time? It's pretty close to dusk, the
sun is getting close to the mountain line, you

1059
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:09,374
probably have another hour of daylight.

1060
01:08:09,374 --> 01:08:10,238
MARISHA: Okay.

1061
01:08:10,238 --> 01:08:11,393
TALIESIN: To the Clasp?

1062
01:08:11,393 --> 01:08:14,368
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're probably nocturnal anyway.
That means they're around at night.

1063
01:08:14,368 --> 01:08:16,829
TALIESIN: They're not turtles, no.

1064
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:19,318
MARISHA: Did you learn something new, Grog?

1065
01:08:19,318 --> 01:08:21,585
TRAVIS: What?

1066
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:27,386
MATT: All right, you guys heading back into Emon?

1067
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:32,282
SAM: Everyone? Some? All?

1068
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:33,961
TALIESIN: I think Pike should stay behind to take
care for--

1069
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:35,603
MARISHA: You seem to have reservations--

1070
01:08:35,603 --> 01:08:38,471
SAM: Vex, are you okay going down there? You're
marked for death by these people.

1071
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:41,029
LAURA: I've been down there several times without
knowing that.

1072
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:44,603
SAM: I know, I feel like it might put you on
edge.

1073
01:08:44,603 --> 01:08:49,726
LIAM: She's not marked for death, she was marked
for death, it's just awkward. It's awkward. I'm

1074
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:52,913
not a full-fledged member, they don't like me. I
don't like them!

1075
01:08:52,913 --> 01:08:55,279
LAURA: Maybe I can become a member.

1076
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,615
LIAM: Maybe you can.

1077
01:08:56,615 --> 01:08:59,081
TALIESIN: This is politics, you're not supposed to
like them.

1078
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:02,676
LIAM: Well, let's go, then.

1079
01:09:02,676 --> 01:09:04,021
TRAVIS: Yeah! What he said.

1080
01:09:04,021 --> 01:09:08,261
MATT: You guys taking the tunnel or you walking
in?

1081
01:09:08,261 --> 01:09:11,020
LAURA: Taking the tunnel, we're taking the secret
entrance--

1082
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,642
TRAVIS: Oh come on, we're never even-- we've not
even walked in yet.

1083
01:09:13,642 --> 01:09:17,815
LAURA: Garthok showed us the secret entrance, he's
waiting for us and having them prepare our way,

1084
01:09:17,815 --> 01:09:19,072
this could get bad.

1085
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:24,520
MATT: No, are you guys walking through your tunnel to the
city, is what I'm saying.

1086
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:28,325
LAURA: Oh! That! Yes. Cool.

1087
01:09:28,325 --> 01:09:30,253
LIAM: We're not going to walk in the open.

1088
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:32,533
SAM: What are we doing?

1089
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:34,982
LAURA: We're taking our secret tunnel into the
city.

1090
01:09:34,982 --> 01:09:40,286
SAM: Okay. It puts us in the wrong side of the
city, but it's okay.

1091
01:09:40,286 --> 01:09:42,688
LAURA: What else are we going to do?

1092
01:09:42,688 --> 01:09:44,580
MARISHA: (coughing)

1093
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,422
LAURA: How you doing there? You okay?

1094
01:09:47,422 --> 01:09:51,945
MARISHA: I'm good. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I got a piece of
chip stuck.

1095
01:09:51,945 --> 01:09:54,057
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to leave one with Vax.

1096
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:55,216
TRAVIS: What is it?

1097
01:09:55,216 --> 01:09:58,070
TALIESIN: I'm giving Vax my gatestone.

1098
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,518
LIAM: That's a good idea.

1099
01:09:59,518 --> 01:10:01,773
TALIESIN: I'm giving you the other one.

1100
01:10:01,773 --> 01:10:04,213
LIAM: For now, it's a good idea, I won't hold onto
it forever.

1101
01:10:04,213 --> 01:10:07,022
TALIESIN: He's the one who's going to get stuck
in a room alone if they decide they don't like him.

1102
01:10:07,022 --> 01:10:11,872
LIAM: Can we call this the Jenga stone? In moments
of need.

1103
01:10:11,872 --> 01:10:14,862
TALIESIN: Jenga stone. Remember, it takes about a
minute to work.

1104
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:18,478
LIAM: Do I need to spend a little time with this?

1105
01:10:18,478 --> 01:10:24,060
MATT: No. However, it does work only once a day.

1106
01:10:24,107 --> 01:10:25,236
LIAM: Once a day?

1107
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:27,042
MATT: After another long rest you'd be able to use
it again.

1108
01:10:27,042 --> 01:10:28,708
LIAM: All right. Good to know. All right.

1109
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,608
SAM: Into the city.

1110
01:10:30,608 --> 01:10:32,048
LAURA: In your pants.

1111
01:10:32,048 --> 01:10:40,121
MATT: Like you do. Half-elven storage space. You
guys find your way back into Emon, utilizing your

1112
01:10:40,121 --> 01:10:45,937
secret tunnel entrance, coming up through the
false outhouse once again. You leave the chain

1113
01:10:45,937 --> 01:10:49,164
behind, locking it up, and make your way into the
city.

1114
01:10:49,164 --> 01:10:51,187
LAURA: Cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

1115
01:10:51,187 --> 01:10:54,870
MATT: All right. You guys, I'd like you all to
make a stealth check.

1116
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:59,889
TRAVIS: Come on, giant blue nut ball dice.

1117
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:02,470
Natural 20!

1118
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:05,931
LAURA: Aw, it fell out of my hand. I don't think
it should count if it fell.

1119
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:07,334
MATT: Nope, too bad.

1120
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:09,759
LAURA: Aw, that's mean. Oh, I get advantage!

1121
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:12,358
SAM: Oh, and we get a plus ten, right?

1122
01:11:12,358 --> 01:11:14,642
TALIESIN: 33.

1123
01:11:14,642 --> 01:11:15,750
SAM: 15.

1124
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,296
MARISHA: 35.

1125
01:11:17,296 --> 01:11:18,224
LIAM: 38.

1126
01:11:18,224 --> 01:11:19,151
LAURA 35.

1127
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:20,501
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1128
01:11:20,501 --> 01:11:28,708
SAM: Wait. With no judgment, is Trinket coming?

1129
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:32,439
LAURA: Trinket is staying with Pike.

1130
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:34,459
SAM: That's a fine decision.

1131
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:35,721
MATT: Okay.

1132
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:39,022
TRAVIS: Hell hath frozen over.

1133
01:11:39,022 --> 01:11:41,395
MATT: Placing Trinket over here.

1134
01:11:41,395 --> 01:11:48,005
LAURA: Oh! He's crying! I'm crying.

1135
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:51,187
MATT: So as you guys start dodging between the
alleyways, making your way towards the north side

1136
01:11:51,187 --> 01:12:00,991
of Emon, alongside the ruined interior of the
Cloudtop District, you instinctually begin to--

1137
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:07,378
and I'd say-- who else has proficiency in
perception?

1138
01:12:07,378 --> 01:12:11,756
LIAM: Right here.

1139
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:19,376
MATT: All right. You guys all start noticing there
are what looks initially like flocks of birds

1140
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:26,298
moving through the sky. Some of them are heading
down into parts of the town in the distance. As

1141
01:12:26,298 --> 01:12:34,696
you continue to push forward, one set of four in
particular start heading overhead. You look up and

1142
01:12:34,696 --> 01:12:43,307
you can see a small cluster of about five or six
flying creatures. Not dragon-sized, by any means,

1143
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:48,745
but either a very, very large bird or something of
that degree. You can't make out the details, as

1144
01:12:48,745 --> 01:12:54,508
right now as the sun's beginning to set, a lot of
it's dark against a red-orange sky. You keep

1145
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:59,221
yourself at bay, waiting for them to pass.

1146
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,105
MARISHA: Oh, waiting for them to pass?

1147
01:13:01,105 --> 01:13:03,573
MATT: Unless you guys want to do something else.

1148
01:13:03,573 --> 01:13:08,702
LAURA: As a dragon-favored enemy, could I
guesstimate what those winged creatures are that

1149
01:13:08,702 --> 01:13:10,191
would hang out around dragons?

1150
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:11,798
TRAVIS: Could you determine if they're wyverns?

1151
01:13:11,798 --> 01:13:19,269
MATT: Yes. They are actually indeed wyverns.
Wivverns. However you want to pronounce it. Both

1152
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:20,991
work in my world. It's fine.

1153
01:13:20,991 --> 01:13:22,217
LIAM: It's pronounced 'jif'.

1154
01:13:22,217 --> 01:13:23,036
MATT: Yes.

1155
01:13:23,036 --> 01:13:24,538
(laughter)

1156
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:30,521
MATT: I will fight you. But yeah.

1157
01:13:30,521 --> 01:13:32,677
SAM: They're diving into the city?

1158
01:13:32,677 --> 01:13:39,023
MATT: You can see a few that dove into city and
stayed there. And one group goes overhead, and

1159
01:13:39,023 --> 01:13:44,927
continues onward.

1160
01:13:44,927 --> 01:13:46,643
MARISHA: Okay.

1161
01:13:46,643 --> 01:13:51,899
MATT: Pushing forward, deeper into the city, you
make your way through the Temple District, and

1162
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:55,428
start pushing through Abdar's Promenade once
again, retracing your steps from the day before,

1163
01:13:55,428 --> 01:14:05,242
dodging through open areas as fast as possible to
stay within the shadows. All of you go darting

1164
01:14:05,242 --> 01:14:11,762
into one of the alleyways. As you turn behind you,
you can see your tiny-legged gnomish bard friend,

1165
01:14:11,762 --> 01:14:18,490
keeping up as best as he can before his foot
hitting a divot on the ground and (slam) falling

1166
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:21,340
face first on the ground, making just enough
noise--

1167
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,726
SAM: Sorry. Sorry.

1168
01:14:22,726 --> 01:14:28,767
MATT: You hear a little screech in the distance.
(screech) And coming up on the rooftop, you can

1169
01:14:28,767 --> 01:14:36,517
see, perched up there, appears to be one wyvern
that is looking over down at the currently toppled

1170
01:14:36,517 --> 01:14:44,140
gnome, and on top of the wyvern, you see something
riding it. Something that is holding reins on the

1171
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,306
edge, something humanoid is glancing over, just a
little enough of a shadow, to see.

1172
01:14:48,306 --> 01:14:50,030
SAM: He sees me? I see him?

1173
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:51,224
MATT: He looks down at you, yeah.

1174
01:14:51,224 --> 01:14:54,638
SAM: Okay. I will cast Hold Person on him.

1175
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:56,287
MATT: Okay.

1176
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:58,586
SAM: I don't know what he is, but I want him to
stop.

1177
01:14:58,586 --> 01:15:00,179
LIAM: And Scanlan's the only one-- we all see it?

1178
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:04,330
MATT: You all barely see it looking over the edge
as Scanlan's there, left in the middle of the main

1179
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:16,389
walkway. That is going to be a natural 17 on the
will save. That'll be an 18. What's your DC?

1180
01:15:16,389 --> 01:15:19,680
SAM: Well, it's 17, but the hand-cone makes it
19.

1181
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,979
LAURA: Ah-ha!

1182
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:23,595
SAM: Do you think I had the wherewithal to use
it?

1183
01:15:23,595 --> 01:15:29,016
MATT: With having you fallen on your face, I'd say
probably not. Since it wasn't specified, that

1184
01:15:29,016 --> 01:15:35,347
would be a DC of 17. So the creature seems to rear
back for a second, shake its head, and you get a

1185
01:15:35,347 --> 01:15:38,477
little bit of a look at the features at this
point, too. And it is humanoid, but you can see

1186
01:15:38,477 --> 01:15:43,903
its outer body is not fleshy, or smooth, it is
scaled and bumpy. You can see ridges across the

1187
01:15:43,903 --> 01:15:50,604
back of the head, and in one of the hands, looks
like some sort of a spear. Immediately as it rears

1188
01:15:50,604 --> 01:15:53,448
back, it puts its head up and goes (guttural
gibberish).

1189
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,187
LAURA: The creature?

1190
01:15:55,187 --> 01:15:57,025
MATT: Yeah, riding on the back of the wyvern.

1191
01:15:57,025 --> 01:15:58,737
LAURA: Those are the things that attacked the
airship!

1192
01:15:58,737 --> 01:16:00,500
SAM: Yes. Possibly.

1193
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,925
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

1194
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:06,042
TALIESIN: This is going to be fun.

1195
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:11,436
LAURA: I think you should turn it into a bunny,
Keyleth! Turn it into a bunny.

1196
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:19,597
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. I can do that today. Just
rolled shitty on my initiative.

1197
01:16:19,597 --> 01:16:24,285
LIAM: Not too good.

1198
01:16:24,285 --> 01:16:36,802
SAM: (singing) This is the music that plays when
we fight!

1199
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:48,084
MATT: All right, so! Scanlan, as you were running
across the thoroughfare, you tripped and fell that way.

1200
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:49,792
SAM: That's me!

1201
01:16:49,792 --> 01:17:12,932
MATT: The rest of you had come into this alley
over here. Currently, looking over the top of this

1202
01:17:12,932 --> 01:17:18,574
rooftop, is this wyvern and its rider.

1203
01:17:18,574 --> 01:17:20,874
MARISHA: I love that the rider is like (derpy
noise).

1204
01:17:20,874 --> 01:17:22,490
MATT: (imitates derpy noise) It's fine.

1205
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:24,379
MARISHA: Go home, rider, you're drunk.

1206
01:17:24,379 --> 01:17:29,613
MATT: That's going to be-- 25 to 20?

1207
01:17:29,613 --> 01:17:30,893
TALIESIN: 26.

1208
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:35,023
TRAVIS: 20.

1209
01:17:35,023 --> 01:17:38,895
MATT: 20. All right, 20 to 15?

1210
01:17:38,895 --> 01:17:40,210
LAURA: 18.

1211
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:48,857
MATT: 18, let's see. Vex. 15 to ten?

1212
01:17:48,857 --> 01:17:51,623
SAM: Yikes.

1213
01:17:51,623 --> 01:17:53,891
MATT: Ten to five?

1214
01:17:53,891 --> 01:17:55,497
SAM: Eight! No, seven.

1215
01:17:55,497 --> 01:17:56,751
MARISHA: Five.

1216
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:58,518
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1217
01:17:58,518 --> 01:17:59,651
TALIESIN: Wow.

1218
01:17:59,651 --> 01:18:03,045
LIAM: Uno!

1219
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,598
MATT: Plus?

1220
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:08,552
LIAM: Oh, six, thanks for that.

1221
01:18:08,552 --> 01:18:10,428
MATT: So you would be-- actually, technically,
Keyleth, is next to you.

1222
01:18:10,428 --> 01:18:12,335
LIAM: That was so crushing, to see the number on
the die.

1223
01:18:12,335 --> 01:18:23,325
MATT: Aw, sorry buddy. It happens to the best of
us. All righty. So. Currently with this guy up on

1224
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:25,878
top of the rooftop, Percy, you are first.

1225
01:18:25,878 --> 01:18:29,697
TALIESIN: Quick question, is he in flight, or is
he just sitting on the rooftop?

1226
01:18:29,697 --> 01:18:32,397
MATT: Just sitting on the roof, perched on the
edge. You can't even actually see him, everyone

1227
01:18:32,397 --> 01:18:35,852
else who's near the front can see, the few that
made the check. You've got a little bit of

1228
01:18:35,852 --> 01:18:40,227
movement up there, but you're just out of view
with the building-- you're right in an alleyway.

1229
01:18:40,227 --> 01:18:44,406
TALIESIN: There's no easy way up onto the roof, is
there?

1230
01:18:44,406 --> 01:18:49,195
MATT: Aside from a well-placed acrobatics check.
You could try.

1231
01:18:49,195 --> 01:18:51,477
TALIESIN: That would be my whole movement, too,
wouldn't it, though?

1232
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,023
MATT: Most likely.

1233
01:18:53,023 --> 01:18:54,589
TALIESIN: Nah, let's see.

1234
01:18:54,589 --> 01:18:55,945
TRAVIS: And how high is the roof?

1235
01:18:55,945 --> 01:19:04,092
MATT: I'd say it's about anywhere from 16 to 20
feet tall. It's two-story, but it's not extremely

1236
01:19:04,092 --> 01:19:05,793
well-built.

1237
01:19:05,793 --> 01:19:09,639
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to get a vantage point
where I can at least get where he's only

1238
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:14,186
three-quarters cover. So I suppose I'm going to
head south down the alley to see if I can get a--

1239
01:19:14,186 --> 01:19:15,616
MATT: Pushing to these guys?

1240
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:16,521
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1241
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:19,308
MATT: Okay, so one-- You can get to about there if
you want to.

1242
01:19:19,308 --> 01:19:20,849
TALIESIN: I can get a good look at him there.

1243
01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:22,442
MATT: You can see, yeah. He'll have half-cover
from there.

1244
01:19:22,442 --> 01:19:28,334
TALIESIN: Half-cover's fine. So, if I were to
knock him prone, would he fall off the roof, or

1245
01:19:28,334 --> 01:19:31,471
could I try and push him off the roof? These are
my--

1246
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:34,321
MATT: For the wyvern, or for the rider?

1247
01:19:34,321 --> 01:19:35,449
TALIESIN: The wyvern.

1248
01:19:35,449 --> 01:19:41,346
MATT: You can try. It's hard-pressed, he's sturdy
on the side, knocking him prone might fall over

1249
01:19:41,346 --> 01:19:45,950
onto the rooftop. Who knows if it'll slide or not.
It's your call. What do you want to try?

1250
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:50,219
TALIESIN: I'll try knocking him prone, and see if
that does it.

1251
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,043
MATT: Okay!

1252
01:19:51,043 --> 01:19:52,280
TALIESIN: Actually--

1253
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:57,528
SAM: Do it!

1254
01:19:57,528 --> 01:20:00,551
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's either that or try and push
him off the roof, which could be pretty funny.

1255
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:02,092
I'll try and knock him prone.

1256
01:20:02,092 --> 01:20:03,274
MATT: Okay.

1257
01:20:03,274 --> 01:20:06,851
TALIESIN: All right. So I'm going to use Bad News,
because that's funnier.

1258
01:20:06,851 --> 01:20:08,683
MATT: Okay. So (whoosh) you whip out.

1259
01:20:08,683 --> 01:20:15,368
TALIESIN: Take a shot. That's a 28 to hit.

1260
01:20:15,368 --> 01:20:16,647
MATT: That'll hit.

1261
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:23,137
TALIESIN: And that's a wing shot, so you have to
make a constitution saving throw.

1262
01:20:23,137 --> 01:20:26,173
MATT: Okay.

1263
01:20:26,173 --> 01:20:28,075
TALIESIN: Against 18.

1264
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:29,926
MATT: Well, this is the wing or leg shot, right?

1265
01:20:29,926 --> 01:20:32,712
TALIESIN: Wing or leg shot. I'm sorry, that's a--
Actually, I'm sorry, I have the new sheet.

1266
01:20:32,712 --> 01:20:34,965
MATT: Yeah, new sheet on that one. Updated that.

1267
01:20:34,965 --> 01:20:39,093
TALIESIN: Strength saving throw. Sorry, strength
saving throw against 18.

1268
01:20:39,093 --> 01:20:43,090
MATT: Okay. That's a natural 19 plus four for
strength, so that's a 23 on the save.

1269
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:44,919
TALIESIN: Motherfucker, but he'll still take some
damage.

1270
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:46,295
MATT: Still takes damage though, go ahead and
roll.

1271
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:51,837
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at him,
too, because eff that. I was not quite prepared

1272
01:20:51,837 --> 01:21:02,119
for this. 2d12 plus six, four, eight, 14 points of
damage.

1273
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:04,641
MATT: 14 points of damage, nice. All right.

1274
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:08,432
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take a-- reload, take
another shot and try and knock him off the roof.

1275
01:21:08,432 --> 01:21:09,972
MATT: Go for it. The same shot?

1276
01:21:09,972 --> 01:21:22,703
TALIESIN: Same shot. Ugh. That's a three, so that
means I--

1277
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:23,745
MATT: Misfire.

1278
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,223
SAM: Clank!

1279
01:21:25,223 --> 01:21:30,413
MATT: So, first shot of Bad News, (explosion
noise) echoes, the sound of the blast rippling

1280
01:21:30,413 --> 01:21:36,024
through the nearby alleyways, the blast hits the
wyvern in part of its arm, sending a spray of

1281
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:40,928
blood as it shrieks in pain. As you can see its
rider is moved to the side, and you see a second

1282
01:21:40,928 --> 01:21:45,929
head behind the rider from the reaction of
movement. Looks like there's actually two of these

1283
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:52,003
creatures riding on the back of this creature. As
you go to reload, bring Bad News up again to fire

1284
01:21:52,003 --> 01:21:57,859
a second time, you pull the trigger and there's a
(thump) sound, and you can see now a stream of

1285
01:21:57,859 --> 01:22:02,934
smoke pouring out the back of the gun itself, and
you're a little worried what this is going to do

1286
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:04,469
if you don't fix it soon.

1287
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:05,643
TRAVIS: Look down the barrel!

1288
01:22:05,643 --> 01:22:06,942
SAM: Yeah, that'll work.

1289
01:22:06,942 --> 01:22:13,765
TALIESIN: I can use my-- I actually can't do-- Am
I going to panic and try and fix this?

1290
01:22:13,765 --> 01:22:19,631
MATT: Next turn? That's your movement, that's your
three attacks, do you have a bonus? Anything?

1291
01:22:19,631 --> 01:22:27,284
TALIESIN: I can-- I'm going to, I'm going to throw
an action surge and see if I can fix this.

1292
01:22:27,284 --> 01:22:30,612
MATT: Go for it. Go ahead and make your tinker
check.

1293
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:34,339
TALIESIN: Yes! Yeah, 14.

1294
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:38,870
MATT: So you spend your action quickly trying to
fix the gun and get Bad News back. You manage to

1295
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:42,688
clear the barrel, get the pellet out, as the rest
of the team starts coming up with their turns.

1296
01:22:42,688 --> 01:22:45,662
That'll be the rest of your action. Okay, finishes
Percy's turn. Grog, you're up.

1297
01:22:45,662 --> 01:22:50,531
TRAVIS: I'd like to hold my turn until it gets off
the roof and maybe comes down to the ground.

1298
01:22:50,531 --> 01:22:58,861
MATT: Okay, okay, good to know. Let's see here. It
appears that my-- Taliesin, could you do me a

1299
01:22:58,861 --> 01:23:00,711
favor and hand me that box next to the fridge
there?

1300
01:23:00,711 --> 01:23:01,702
TALIESIN: Sure.

1301
01:23:01,702 --> 01:23:05,612
MATT: Thank you. All right, so Grog, as you're
doing that, the blasting sound of Bad News that

1302
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:09,850
echoed through, you all of a sudden start hearing
other shrieks in the distance, like a call to arms

1303
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,432
of a number of other entities.

1304
01:23:11,432 --> 01:23:12,527
MARISHA: Oh boy.

1305
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:17,762
MATT: As you see a multitude of other winged
creatures begin to arise in the distance.

1306
01:23:17,762 --> 01:23:19,858
TALIESIN: I shouldn't have gotten him that box,
should I?

1307
01:23:19,858 --> 01:23:22,128
MARISHA: Was that in the box?

1308
01:23:22,128 --> 01:23:23,892
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could always run, too.

1309
01:23:23,892 --> 01:23:25,205
TALIESIN: Could.

1310
01:23:25,205 --> 01:23:32,218
SAM: How far are we from the tunnel system? Far.

1311
01:23:32,218 --> 01:23:39,437
MATT: You're a ways. Probably a good 25-minute
run. There's another one on the roof over here.

1312
01:23:39,437 --> 01:23:46,031
And there's one on this roof here. Each one of
them with their own riders, as well.

1313
01:23:46,031 --> 01:23:47,331
LAURA: Shit.

1314
01:23:47,331 --> 01:23:57,788
MATT: Now. All right, so for this turn, this one
leaps off and swoops down here to where Percy is

1315
01:23:57,788 --> 01:24:04,224
while both of its riders leap off to the side. One
that leaps off and rushes over to Scanlan on the

1316
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:11,805
ground, and this other one that gets right up next
to Percy. This one goes flying forward and lands

1317
01:24:11,805 --> 01:24:24,641
in the center to about there. Two of its riders
leap off. This one stays up in the air over this

1318
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:28,886
way in a flanking position-- or in a visual
perspective with two of its riders on its back.

1319
01:24:28,886 --> 01:24:30,689
Put them there.

1320
01:24:30,689 --> 01:24:35,192
LIAM: For clarification, does this count as turns,
or are they, since they're coming late to the

1321
01:24:35,192 --> 01:24:37,550
party, or this is just them in position?

1322
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,430
MATT: This is them now entering the fray.

1323
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:42,750
LIAM: Are they into the initiative order, just
gameplay talk?

1324
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:47,527
MATT: Yeah. Well, this is the initiative I rolled
for them after being called by the guy who was

1325
01:24:47,527 --> 01:24:49,226
already shouting out into the air.

1326
01:24:49,226 --> 01:24:50,427
LAURA: Oh, right, right, right.

1327
01:24:50,427 --> 01:24:59,860
MATT: You didn't see them before, given your
perspective. These guys leap off over here-- over

1328
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:06,181
there. Okay. So we have, first the wyvern that
swooped down on you, Percy, is going to go ahead

1329
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:10,195
and make an attack with its bite and an attack
with its stinger as a multiattack. So that first

1330
01:25:10,195 --> 01:25:15,979
strike, that is going to be a-- The bite, 13?

1331
01:25:15,979 --> 01:25:17,375
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

1332
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:20,798
MATT: The stinger, however, is a 19.

1333
01:25:20,798 --> 01:25:28,146
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my Amulet of the Shield
and up my AC for that attack to 23, so.

1334
01:25:28,146 --> 01:25:33,612
MATT: Yeah. So that will miss. So that uses the
Amulet. Good to know. So the stinger goes to

1335
01:25:33,612 --> 01:25:37,613
strike you after the bite misses, and as you grasp
your chest, you can see now an arcane barrier

1336
01:25:37,613 --> 01:25:43,140
shines in front of you and completely ricochets
the stinger out into the air to the side as it

1337
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:51,929
reacts angrily. The other giant humanoid lizard
creature that's coming towards you with a giant

1338
01:25:51,929 --> 01:25:55,286
heavy club is going to attempt to slam you with
it.

1339
01:25:55,286 --> 01:25:56,699
LAURA: There's so many things!

1340
01:25:56,699 --> 01:26:00,242
MATT: Twice. Well, it's going to attack you with
its club, that's going to be a 17.

1341
01:26:00,242 --> 01:26:01,331
TALIESIN: Nope.

1342
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:05,885
MATT: And then it's going to try and slam you with
a spike shield. That is 15.

1343
01:26:05,885 --> 01:26:06,970
TALIESIN: Nope.

1344
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:09,201
MATT: So that guy starts swinging at you loosely.

1345
01:26:09,201 --> 01:26:11,253
TALIESIN: I'm sword out. Yeah.

1346
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:13,808
MATT: All right. Attacking you, Scanlan.

1347
01:26:13,808 --> 01:26:15,123
SAM: Oh. Shit.

1348
01:26:15,123 --> 01:26:20,648
MATT: The one that's on the ground there. All
right. So it has two attacks against you with

1349
01:26:20,648 --> 01:26:21,668
advantage.

1350
01:26:21,668 --> 01:26:22,854
SAM: With advantage?

1351
01:26:22,854 --> 01:26:28,233
MATT: Because you're prone. You're on the ground.
That'll be a 24 to hit.

1352
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:29,572
SAM: Yeah, yeah, okay.

1353
01:26:29,572 --> 01:26:34,893
MATT: And the spike shield is going to be a 24
again, actually.

1354
01:26:34,893 --> 01:26:36,432
LAURA: Oh no!

1355
01:26:36,432 --> 01:26:43,172
MATT: So as you're on the ground, it slams you
with a shield for 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

1356
01:26:43,172 --> 01:26:44,375
SAM: Okay.

1357
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:46,036
LAURA: Why didn't I bring Trinket?

1358
01:26:46,036 --> 01:26:48,148
SAM: I know! What's wrong with you?

1359
01:26:48,148 --> 01:26:52,336
MATT: The shield slams you for eight points of
piercing damage. So a total of 20 points of damage

1360
01:26:52,336 --> 01:26:54,899
as (whack) slams you into the ground twice.

1361
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:56,979
LAURA: I thought this was a stealthing mission!

1362
01:26:56,979 --> 01:26:59,660
MATT: It was until he rolled a 15 stealth.

1363
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:02,885
SAM: Blame me, blame me.

1364
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:08,369
MATT: Those wyverns are too far away for combat.
The other guys are just assisting the scenario here.

1365
01:27:08,369 --> 01:27:09,571
LIAM: Percy shot at them.

1366
01:27:09,571 --> 01:27:18,766
MATT: Okay. There's one fellow over here that is a
bit far away who steps off. Instead of holding the

1367
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:23,171
same clubs and shields or other various hack
weapons, he's carrying a gnarled staff.

1368
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:24,193
SAM: Oh, shit.

1369
01:27:24,193 --> 01:27:28,493
MATT: Steps forward and sees the weapon that you
fired twice and had been fixing, this large

1370
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:35,072
metallic dangerous entity, looks forward and
begins hissing under his breath (hissing gibberish).

1371
01:27:35,072 --> 01:27:37,337
SAM: Do I see this?

1372
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:38,576
MATT: You do.

1373
01:27:38,576 --> 01:27:40,316
SAM: I'm going to release my--

1374
01:27:40,316 --> 01:27:43,145
MATT: Though you are being slammed on the ground.
I'd say make a perception check, actually, to see

1375
01:27:43,145 --> 01:27:44,228
if you see this.

1376
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:45,093
SAM: Okay.

1377
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,107
MATT: Because you are currently--

1378
01:27:46,107 --> 01:27:47,086
SAM: 19!

1379
01:27:47,086 --> 01:27:48,807
MATT: Yes, actually, I will say you do see this.

1380
01:27:48,807 --> 01:27:50,438
SAM: I will release my Counterspell.

1381
01:27:50,438 --> 01:27:51,644
MATT: Okay!

1382
01:27:51,644 --> 01:27:53,581
SAM: I assume he's casting something.

1383
01:27:53,581 --> 01:27:54,788
MATT: He is, actually--

1384
01:27:54,788 --> 01:27:56,641
TRAVIS: Or has a terrible cold.

1385
01:27:56,641 --> 01:28:03,684
SAM: And I will-- I will sing at him, (singing) And you
still haven't hit what you're aiming for!

1386
01:28:03,684 --> 01:28:09,304
MATT: That's a second-level spell, it is dispelled
immediately. As he'd attempted to Heat Metal on

1387
01:28:09,304 --> 01:28:12,710
your weapon, you can see as the metal begins to
glow for a moment and you could feel the heat

1388
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:16,906
welling in your hand, all of a sudden the spell
(crack) is shattered, like the sound of thin glass

1389
01:28:16,906 --> 01:28:24,148
in the distance as Scanlan shouts to intercept its
arcane ability. That is going to end their opening

1390
01:28:24,148 --> 01:28:27,789
turn. That brings us down to the initiative order.
Vex, you're up.

1391
01:28:27,789 --> 01:28:29,052
LAURA: Oh, I think Grog was before me.

1392
01:28:29,052 --> 01:28:30,523
MATT: Oh, right, Grog, you're holding your action
first.

1393
01:28:30,523 --> 01:28:35,191
TRAVIS: Right. Can I barrel down through the alley
now that someone's on the ground, and race towards

1394
01:28:35,191 --> 01:28:36,793
the one that's nearest Percy?

1395
01:28:36,793 --> 01:28:41,195
MATT: I'll say sure. Usually, going forward, if
you hold your action, that's just your action, not

1396
01:28:41,195 --> 01:28:44,550
your movement, you still move to the situation,
but I'll let it stand for this, it's fine.

1397
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:45,933
TRAVIS: I'll remember that going forward.

1398
01:28:45,933 --> 01:28:48,145
MATT: Yeah. So you're going to tear down to this
guy there?

1399
01:28:48,145 --> 01:28:54,522
TRAVIS: Yeah. I would like-- and I would like to
swing twice with Craven.

1400
01:28:54,522 --> 01:28:59,331
MATT: Go for it. Still maintaining your bonuses
from last game, by the way. You haven't taken a

1401
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:00,596
short rest yet.

1402
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:01,627
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

1403
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:02,542
TRAVIS: Yes indeed.

1404
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:04,125
LAURA: He's so strong from the last game.

1405
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:07,571
TRAVIS: Plus-- That's 26.

1406
01:29:07,571 --> 01:29:08,948
MATT: 26 hits.

1407
01:29:08,948 --> 01:29:12,976
TRAVIS: And a 14 on the second one.

1408
01:29:12,976 --> 01:29:18,952
MATT: 14 does not hit. This is the Great Weapon
Master?

1409
01:29:18,952 --> 01:29:20,691
TRAVIS: No, these are regular attacks.

1410
01:29:20,691 --> 01:29:22,027
LAURA: You didn't rage yet?

1411
01:29:22,027 --> 01:29:23,142
MATT: Did you rage?

1412
01:29:23,142 --> 01:29:25,694
TRAVIS: Yeah. Oh! No, I did not.

1413
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,868
MATT: Do you want to rage as part of your bonus
action to this?

1414
01:29:28,868 --> 01:29:30,432
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

1415
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:34,716
MATT: Okay. Figures. All right, so as your bonus
action you go into a rage before you strike. Go

1416
01:29:34,716 --> 01:29:35,698
for it.

1417
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:42,368
TRAVIS: 12-- 22? Oh, wait. Yep, 22.

1418
01:29:42,368 --> 01:29:46,225
MATT: 22 damage. All right. The second strike
missed.

1419
01:29:46,225 --> 01:29:48,844
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. 22, that's it.

1420
01:29:48,844 --> 01:29:54,296
MATT: 22. So you rush forward, slam the sword into
the side of the lizard creature. It puts its

1421
01:29:54,296 --> 01:29:57,534
shield up and it manages to block most of the
blow, but it still slides off and slams into part

1422
01:29:57,534 --> 01:30:02,990
of its neck area. It shoves the blade out.
However, it fails its save.

1423
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,076
TRAVIS: Yes!

1424
01:30:04,076 --> 01:30:08,571
MATT: Take a strength point off of it and add that
to what you have now. What's your strength

1425
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:09,648
currently?

1426
01:30:09,648 --> 01:30:11,216
TRAVIS: 22.

1427
01:30:11,216 --> 01:30:15,845
MATT: So it goes up another plus one to attack and
damage. If it became 22, it does.

1428
01:30:15,845 --> 01:30:16,883
TRAVIS: Yes.

1429
01:30:16,883 --> 01:30:19,309
MATT: All right. Grog, that ends your turn. Vex,
you're up.

1430
01:30:19,309 --> 01:30:28,359
LAURA: Is there anywhere I can stand that I get a
good cone shape? Or am I all blocked in?

1431
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:30,455
MATT: You can try to move through. You might get
an attack of opportunity from the guy that's

1432
01:30:30,455 --> 01:30:31,281
attacking Grog.

1433
01:30:31,281 --> 01:30:34,077
LAURA: Okay, how high is the roof next to me?

1434
01:30:34,077 --> 01:30:35,750
MATT: It's about 16, 20 feet.

1435
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,211
LAURA: Could I acrobatics that shit up?

1436
01:30:37,211 --> 01:30:38,955
MATT: You could try to. Go for it.

1437
01:30:38,955 --> 01:30:39,699
LAURA: Okay.

1438
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:43,128
LIAM: Parkour!

1439
01:30:43,128 --> 01:30:48,805
LAURA: Hold on. Oh! 31?

1440
01:30:48,805 --> 01:30:52,768
MATT: With that, you look over and see the rooftop
up there. You leap off each side, Ninja

1441
01:30:52,768 --> 01:30:58,847
Gaiden-style. Hop onto the rooftop with a solid
view of the entire battlefield before you,

1442
01:30:58,847 --> 01:31:02,282
including the one flying creature up there.

1443
01:31:02,282 --> 01:31:11,012
LAURA: Oh, okay. Then I'm going to Hunter's Mark
the magic user.

1444
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:15,179
MATT: All righty.

1445
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:20,929
LAURA: And I'm going to Conjure Barrage in a cone
to get as many of those fucks as I can.

1446
01:31:20,929 --> 01:31:25,404
MATT: Okay, so it's a 60-foot cone. Right there?

1447
01:31:25,404 --> 01:31:27,326
LAURA: Yeah, sure. Sorry, Scanlan.

1448
01:31:27,326 --> 01:31:28,308
MATT: You will hit Scanlan, as well.

1449
01:31:28,308 --> 01:31:32,469
SAM: Oh, balls! I'm a little man!

1450
01:31:32,469 --> 01:31:35,291
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll for that.

1451
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:36,440
LAURA: 3d8.

1452
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:40,018
MATT: Yeah, roll 3d8 damage.

1453
01:31:40,018 --> 01:31:41,654
SAM: 3d8 damage?

1454
01:31:41,654 --> 01:31:42,458
MATT: Yeah!

1455
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:54,166
LAURA: It's not that much. 16, and then an extra
d6 on that guy. An extra six.

1456
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:57,187
MATT: Okay, so does he make his save? He does
not.

1457
01:31:57,187 --> 01:31:59,610
SAM: Do I have to make a save?

1458
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:00,597
MATT: Yes, you do.

1459
01:32:00,597 --> 01:32:02,139
SAM: What kind of save?

1460
01:32:02,139 --> 01:32:04,760
MATT: This would be a dexterity saving throw.

1461
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,939
SAM: And I'm on the ground. That's a nine.

1462
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:22,542
MATT: You take 16 points of damage from that.
That's a fail, and a success. So 16. The wyvern

1463
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:29,744
makes that, so half that for eight. He fails. All
right, cool. Got it. So as you go forward, leaping

1464
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:34,645
up on top, you mark the one guy, turn around, and
release a torrent of arrows that sprays into the

1465
01:32:34,645 --> 01:32:40,234
center of this open pathway of the city. I believe
that ends your turn.

1466
01:32:40,234 --> 01:32:41,184
LAURA: Yes, it does.

1467
01:32:41,184 --> 01:32:42,846
MATT: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.

1468
01:32:42,846 --> 01:32:43,964
SAM: Oh, me?

1469
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:45,039
MATT: Yep.

1470
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:50,274
SAM: Balls. Shit. I'm on the ground. If I stand
up, that's my action?

1471
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:51,510
MATT: It's half your movement.

1472
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:55,216
SAM: That's half my movement. Okay, I'll stand up.
He doesn't get to hit me, right?

1473
01:32:55,216 --> 01:32:57,083
MATT: Not unless you move away from him.

1474
01:32:57,083 --> 01:33:02,647
SAM: Okay. Which riders are still on their
beasts?

1475
01:33:02,647 --> 01:33:08,001
MATT: These two are the only two that are still on
their beasts.

1476
01:33:08,001 --> 01:33:17,709
SAM: I will ignore the guy next to me and I will
Hand Cone it up, and I will-- he's got two riders?

1477
01:33:17,709 --> 01:33:26,000
MATT: Yeah, they have these ramshackle-- you can
see now with a closer look, these leather kind of

1478
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,638
saddles? But they're mostly thrown leathers that
are strapped to its back, and there's two of them

1479
01:33:29,638 --> 01:33:31,677
holding onto these knobs in front to stay on.

1480
01:33:31,677 --> 01:33:35,707
SAM: Two riders?!

1481
01:33:35,707 --> 01:33:38,075
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan.

1482
01:33:38,075 --> 01:33:41,475
SAM: I guess I'll Dominate one of them. The main
guy.

1483
01:33:41,475 --> 01:33:44,033
LAURA: Can you Dominate the beast?

1484
01:33:44,033 --> 01:33:45,233
SAM: He's not a person.

1485
01:33:45,233 --> 01:33:47,002
MATT: There's Dominate Person and Dominate
Monster. They're two different things.

1486
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:49,810
SAM: I'm going to dominate the guy in front.

1487
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,246
MATT: Okay.

1488
01:33:51,246 --> 01:33:54,040
SAM: Maverick, not Hollywood.

1489
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,642
TRAVIS: It's Maverick and Goose!

1490
01:33:55,642 --> 01:33:57,571
SAM: Well, at the end, it was Hollywood.

1491
01:33:57,571 --> 01:33:59,324
TRAVIS: No, it was Merlin.

1492
01:33:59,324 --> 01:34:00,295
SAM: Merlin?!

1493
01:34:00,295 --> 01:34:01,343
TRAVIS: Yeah. Tim Robbins.

1494
01:34:01,343 --> 01:34:07,124
SAM: Merlin was the teacher, the guy who spun out.
Hollywood was the guy who was his--

1495
01:34:07,124 --> 01:34:08,642
TRAVIS: You don't want to do this with me.

1496
01:34:08,642 --> 01:34:12,343
TALIESIN: This is the first conversation I've ever
been in in this group where I feel young.

1497
01:34:12,343 --> 01:34:15,723
MATT: The rider's screeching down while it's
holding on, and all of a sudden it shakes its head

1498
01:34:15,723 --> 01:34:20,939
for a minute and looks down at you, eyes
connected, and you know that this entity is

1499
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:23,089
waiting for its command.

1500
01:34:23,089 --> 01:34:25,989
SAM: Can I only give it one command per turn?

1501
01:34:25,989 --> 01:34:28,958
MATT: You can give it a basic command and it will
follow it through, unless you wanted to directly

1502
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:30,009
control it.

1503
01:34:30,009 --> 01:34:35,005
SAM: Well, I've got two things to do. He's got to
get rid of that fucker on his back, and also other

1504
01:34:35,005 --> 01:34:43,882
things. Let's go for the big kahuna. I command him
to ride his beast to attack the one below him. The

1505
01:34:43,882 --> 01:34:45,962
wyvern below him.

1506
01:34:45,962 --> 01:34:53,640
MATT: Okay. All right, good to know. And do you
want to stay where you are? Do you want to move?

1507
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:58,852
SAM: No, I don't want to move because he'll hit
me. That would be bad. Who hasn't gone? You

1508
01:34:58,852 --> 01:34:59,856
haven't gone.

1509
01:34:59,856 --> 01:35:03,002
TALIESIN: Vax hasn't gone--

1510
01:35:03,002 --> 01:35:05,353
SAM: Vax hasn't gone? Oh my god.

1511
01:35:05,353 --> 01:35:07,404
LAURA: No. because he rolled a one, remember?

1512
01:35:07,404 --> 01:35:10,122
LIAM: Yup!

1513
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:19,168
SAM: Okay. I will inspire Vax with my inspiration.
And I will say: This is ground control to Major

1514
01:35:19,168 --> 01:35:30,032
Vax, you've really made the blade. And the papers
want to know whose blood you spilled!

1515
01:35:30,032 --> 01:35:33,134
MATT: (laughs) All right, take your d10
inspiration die.

1516
01:35:33,134 --> 01:35:34,892
LIAM: d10. Yes.

1517
01:35:34,892 --> 01:35:37,368
SAM: Rest in peace.

1518
01:35:37,368 --> 01:35:40,624
MATT: All right. That's Scanlan's turn. Vax,
you're up.

1519
01:35:40,624 --> 01:35:46,943
LIAM: So I'm having trouble seeing the battle map.
Grog is right against a wyvern, right?

1520
01:35:46,943 --> 01:35:50,013
MATT: Grog is against a lizard-like creature--

1521
01:35:50,013 --> 01:35:51,503
LIAM: Oh, so not against a wyvern?

1522
01:35:51,503 --> 01:35:54,867
MATT: No. That's a little bit away. But Percy is
next to it.

1523
01:35:54,867 --> 01:35:56,286
LIAM: Oh, so Percy is right there?

1524
01:35:56,286 --> 01:35:57,068
MATT: Correct, yes.

1525
01:35:57,068 --> 01:36:00,250
LIAM: And Scanlan's next to the magic user,
right?

1526
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:02,770
MATT: The magic user's over here, that's been
Hunter's Marked.

1527
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:07,113
LIAM: Scanlan's up against a dude, right? All
right, so what I want to do is slink up behind

1528
01:36:07,113 --> 01:36:12,602
Percy, reach over-- oh, no, I want to click my
Boots of Haste, is what I want to do.

1529
01:36:12,602 --> 01:36:15,421
MATT: Did you use them during the battle against
the looters?

1530
01:36:15,421 --> 01:36:16,716
LIAM: I don't think so.

1531
01:36:16,716 --> 01:36:17,825
TRAVIS: I don't remember him doing it.

1532
01:36:17,825 --> 01:36:24,039
LIAM: No, I didn't. No I didn't, I definitely
didn't, because I remember kicking myself for-- I

1533
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:32,813
definitely didn't. Okay so, click, everybody
starts moving slower around me. I want to-- so

1534
01:36:32,813 --> 01:36:37,425
Percy's against the wyvern, I want to reach over
Percy's shoulder and stab the wyvern, and then I

1535
01:36:37,425 --> 01:36:41,480
want to throw another dagger at the dude standing
next to Scanlan.

1536
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,739
MATT: On this side there, you mean?

1537
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:47,558
LIAM: Yeah. Well, I can't tell, I can't see shit--
is that over Percy's shoulder?

1538
01:36:47,558 --> 01:36:50,103
MATT: Because right now you're being blocked, you
can't quite get to the wyvern unless you move

1539
01:36:50,103 --> 01:36:51,570
around the building that you left.

1540
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:56,024
LIAM: But I can go around it, yes, let's do that.
I'm going to stab the wyvern in the butt, and then

1541
01:36:56,024 --> 01:37:01,924
I'm going to throw a dagger from my other hand at
the guy standing next to Scanlan-- I've got a

1542
01:37:01,924 --> 01:37:06,771
question for you. Because both of them have
somebody who's running interference, do I get

1543
01:37:06,771 --> 01:37:08,273
sneak attack damage on both?

1544
01:37:08,273 --> 01:37:09,930
MATT: You only get one sneak attack damage per
turn.

1545
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:10,967
LIAM: Just per turn?

1546
01:37:10,967 --> 01:37:11,805
MATT: Once per turn.

1547
01:37:11,805 --> 01:37:14,730
LIAM: All right. So I'm going to use sneak attack
damage on the wyvern if I get it.

1548
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:18,446
MATT: Go for it! So first strike against it, as
you (whoosh) whip around the side of the building,

1549
01:37:18,446 --> 01:37:19,839
blades out--

1550
01:37:19,839 --> 01:37:21,306
LIAM: 25!

1551
01:37:21,306 --> 01:37:22,495
MATT: That hits!

1552
01:37:22,495 --> 01:37:27,001
LIAM: And then for the dude by Scanlan gets a--
word, 19.

1553
01:37:27,001 --> 01:37:31,525
MATT: Yep. If you have both blades out, you get a
third attack too, don't forget.

1554
01:37:31,525 --> 01:37:36,422
LIAM: I do. Oh-- yes. So the third stab will go
back at the wyvern.

1555
01:37:36,422 --> 01:37:39,314
MATT: Okay! So the sneak attack against the
wyvern, first strike.

1556
01:37:39,314 --> 01:37:46,348
LIAM: Yeah, and the last one was a 24 total, so
that hits as well. Okay! So that's two, one, yes.

1557
01:37:46,348 --> 01:37:59,082
That's 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29 into the
wyvern.

1558
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,411
MATT: All right.

1559
01:38:00,411 --> 01:38:05,645
LIAM: And then the jerk over by Scanlan gets
seven.

1560
01:38:05,645 --> 01:38:07,227
SAM: Yes!

1561
01:38:07,227 --> 01:38:13,113
LIAM: And then the wyvern takes another, the Keen
Dagger, takes another nine.

1562
01:38:13,113 --> 01:38:19,966
MATT: All righty. So, as you rush around, you stab
the wyvern on the back of its haunches and you see

1563
01:38:19,966 --> 01:38:24,689
it shrieks in pain (screeches), looks over its
shoulder and starts biting its tail, its stinger

1564
01:38:24,689 --> 01:38:28,385
swinging about, but you avoid it, fling the other
dagger to the side and then jam the other side of

1565
01:38:28,385 --> 01:38:32,939
its haunches with your other hand. It's definitely
aware of your presence now.

1566
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:35,182
LIAM: Did I use up all my movement?

1567
01:38:35,182 --> 01:38:35,914
MATT: Nope!

1568
01:38:35,914 --> 01:38:39,985
LIAM: Knowing that it can swat at me, I'm going to
try to go right back around where I came from.

1569
01:38:39,985 --> 01:38:40,861
MATT: All right.

1570
01:38:40,861 --> 01:38:43,088
LIAM: And I'm wearing the Cloak of Displacement.

1571
01:38:43,088 --> 01:38:46,245
MATT: Okay. It's going to swing at you with
disadvantage.

1572
01:38:46,245 --> 01:38:47,614
SAM: Just call it cloak number seven.

1573
01:38:47,614 --> 01:38:52,169
MATT: That's a two on the first roll, so yeah.
That misses you. (whoosh) Its stinger swings out

1574
01:38:52,169 --> 01:38:56,061
towards you and you duck underneath, it slams to
the side of the building, breaking part of the

1575
01:38:56,061 --> 01:38:59,971
wood, you can see splinters fly out to the middle
of the road. That ends your turn?

1576
01:38:59,971 --> 01:39:00,740
LIAM: Yeah.

1577
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:02,965
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up.

1578
01:39:02,965 --> 01:39:10,393
MARISHA: Okay. How far away am I from this guy,
like-- roughly how many feet?

1579
01:39:10,393 --> 01:39:12,641
MATT: Roughly--

1580
01:39:12,641 --> 01:39:15,082
MARISHA: The guy who's in the air, flying.

1581
01:39:15,082 --> 01:39:17,474
MATT: I'd say about 60, 65 feet.

1582
01:39:17,474 --> 01:39:26,396
MARISHA: Beautiful. I want to move up and around--
here-ish.

1583
01:39:26,396 --> 01:39:27,427
MATT: Okay.

1584
01:39:27,427 --> 01:39:34,116
MARISHA: Sorry, I've got this thing in the way.
Back a little bit-- scoot back. Is that still in

1585
01:39:34,116 --> 01:39:35,814
your path?

1586
01:39:35,814 --> 01:39:37,794
SAM: No, he's my guy.

1587
01:39:37,794 --> 01:39:43,566
MARISHA: He's your--? Oh. Well, I'm not going to
fuck with him. I'm going to-- you Dominated the guy?

1588
01:39:43,566 --> 01:39:44,896
SAM: I Dominated the guy.

1589
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:47,501
MARISHA: Should I turn the wyvern into something
else?

1590
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:48,601
SAM: I don't know. I don't know.

1591
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:52,145
MARISHA: Should I Polymorph him? Yeah, I guess
he's Dom-- you are Dominating that guy. Is there

1592
01:39:52,145 --> 01:39:57,475
anything else that's flying? He's the only one
that's up in the air left, right?

1593
01:39:57,475 --> 01:40:02,791
MATT: Yeah, all the other wyverns have landed and
let their riders off on the sides.

1594
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:06,570
MARISHA: So you commanded him to attack the one
below you, right? I'm going to turn that wyvern

1595
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,837
into a-- chicken!

1596
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:09,383
MATT: This one?

1597
01:40:09,383 --> 01:40:09,953
MARISHA: Yes!

1598
01:40:09,953 --> 01:40:12,602
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

1599
01:40:12,602 --> 01:40:15,357
MARISHA: Poof! He has to make a wisdom save.

1600
01:40:15,357 --> 01:40:16,847
MATT: That is a seven!

1601
01:40:16,847 --> 01:40:19,004
MARISHA: Fail!

1602
01:40:19,004 --> 01:40:23,712
MATT: And with that-- (laughs) The wyvern--
(laughs) Twice now--

1603
01:40:23,712 --> 01:40:27,353
MARISHA: (laughs) This is my favourite game, you
guys!

1604
01:40:27,353 --> 01:40:34,885
MATT: The bane of wyverns everyone-- (swoop,
chicken noise). As both the riders tumble off,

1605
01:40:34,885 --> 01:40:47,510
slamming into the ground (sound of impact). That
would be-- Okay, ten points of damage to the

1606
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:52,820
wyvern, which kills the chicken form entirely. It
turns back to a wyvern on the ground, taking the

1607
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,137
excess three damage.

1608
01:40:54,137 --> 01:40:57,267
LAURA: Yeah-- (laughs) Keyleth.

1609
01:40:57,267 --> 01:40:58,096
MARISHA: Fuck.

1610
01:40:58,096 --> 01:40:59,089
LAURA: Shit! (laughs)

1611
01:40:59,089 --> 01:41:00,049
MATT: What?

1612
01:41:00,049 --> 01:41:05,169
SAM: Do I keep hold of my guy?

1613
01:41:05,169 --> 01:41:13,912
MATT: The riders fall also, they both take an
additional 14 points of damage to each of them

1614
01:41:13,912 --> 01:41:19,213
from the fall.

1615
01:41:19,213 --> 01:41:22,749
MARISHA: They all took damage-- and they're on the
ground now.

1616
01:41:22,954 --> 01:41:27,401
MATT: Let's see if it takes damage and makes a new
saving throw against the spell. Does not make it,

1617
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:28,481
so it is still Dominated.

1618
01:41:28,481 --> 01:41:29,753
SAM: Oh. Okay. Thank God.

1619
01:41:29,753 --> 01:41:31,796
MARISHA: I didn't fuck it up this time.

1620
01:41:31,796 --> 01:41:36,754
MATT: But they are all-- all three of them are
considered prone for now. They are all knocked prone.

1621
01:41:36,754 --> 01:41:38,083
MARISHA: Cool. That's my turn.

1622
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:40,526
MATT: All right, ends Keyleth's turn. At the top,
Percy, you're up.

1623
01:41:40,526 --> 01:41:42,371
TALIESIN: Okay. Where am I, I can't see--

1624
01:41:42,371 --> 01:41:45,841
MATT: You're right here, you're blocked in between
the two buildings, the mouth of the alleyway, with

1625
01:41:45,841 --> 01:41:49,023
a wyvern and lizard creature right there, standing
before you.

1626
01:41:49,023 --> 01:41:53,507
TALIESIN: Okay, I have no advantage on any of
these bastards at the moment if I were to attack.

1627
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:58,822
Okay, that's fine. And how would you describe--
these are like scaly people?

1628
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:03,220
MATT: This up close and personal, they are
humanoid in build, they have, you know, stand up

1629
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:08,237
upright, they have long tails, ridges across the
head, they're bigger than an actual human and

1630
01:42:08,237 --> 01:42:12,708
they're very muscular, and the more you look at
it, you can see that their clothing, they have

1631
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:17,678
tattered cloth and leathers that have been
haphazardly dyed in blood and gore to all be a

1632
01:42:17,678 --> 01:42:23,209
very, very deep red color. And they're pretty
uniform across what they are wearing.

1633
01:42:23,209 --> 01:42:24,966
LAURA: They're an army.

1634
01:42:24,966 --> 01:42:27,191
SAM: Team colors.

1635
01:42:27,191 --> 01:42:34,252
TALIESIN: I think you've got that one guy covered
at the moment, so I'll concentrate on the--hmm.

1636
01:42:34,252 --> 01:42:37,876
Tough call, tough call. You know what, I'll have a
little fun. I'm going to pull my sword and I'm

1637
01:42:37,876 --> 01:42:42,583
going to take a slash at the guy who's involved
with--

1638
01:42:42,583 --> 01:42:46,219
MATT: All right, go for it.

1639
01:42:46,219 --> 01:42:47,789
TALIESIN: That's 21.

1640
01:42:47,789 --> 01:42:49,111
MATT: 21 hits.

1641
01:42:49,111 --> 01:42:53,907
TALIESIN: Oh shit, I forgot to use my bonus
action. Can I pop in a quick bonus before that?

1642
01:42:53,907 --> 01:42:54,851
MATT: For what?

1643
01:42:54,851 --> 01:42:55,990
TALIESIN: Hex him.

1644
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:58,939
MATT: You've already hexed today. You used it in
the battle versus the looters.

1645
01:42:58,939 --> 01:42:59,918
TALIESIN: Oh, it's--

1646
01:42:59,918 --> 01:43:01,104
SAM: Same day.

1647
01:43:01,104 --> 01:43:05,882
TALIESIN: That's right. Still the same hour. It
can only do it once a day, right? That's all

1648
01:43:05,882 --> 01:43:12,860
right. That's fine, I can just do a little thing.
So, just add to this, would he be described in

1649
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:16,130
anywhere on his little D&amp;D card as something with
a dragon keyword?

1650
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:17,612
MATT: Nope!

1651
01:43:17,612 --> 01:43:18,810
TALIESIN: So I'm just going to do normal damage to
him?

1652
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:19,426
MATT: Yes.

1653
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:21,466
TALIESIN: Okay. So--

1654
01:43:21,466 --> 01:43:22,724
MATT: Wyverns, however--

1655
01:43:22,724 --> 01:43:27,387
TALIESIN: All right, just checking. I'm going to
do nine points of damage, slashing damage, to him.

1656
01:43:27,387 --> 01:43:29,847
MATT: All righty.

1657
01:43:29,847 --> 01:43:32,748
TALIESIN: And I'm going to turn to the wyvern, and
take two slashes at the wyvern.

1658
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:34,532
MATT: Go for it.

1659
01:43:34,532 --> 01:43:38,760
TALIESIN: First is-- ew. 14?

1660
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,090
MATT: 14 hits.

1661
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,099
TALIESIN: Wow.

1662
01:43:41,099 --> 01:43:44,320
MATT: They're sacks of hit points, but they don't
have lot of armor to them.

1663
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:51,012
TALIESIN: That's 19 plus-- 26 points of damage.

1664
01:43:51,012 --> 01:43:52,343
MATT: Nice!

1665
01:43:52,343 --> 01:44:03,598
TALIESIN: And second shot-- 13, 24, yeah, that
hits. Ten, 17, 18, 19, 26 points of damage.

1666
01:44:03,598 --> 01:44:06,838
MATT: 26 twice in a row. So with this you pull the
sword out, as soon as you see it in the proximity

1667
01:44:06,838 --> 01:44:12,439
of the wyvern, the blade itself almost seems to
shimmer with this gleam of green on it, like the

1668
01:44:12,586 --> 01:44:17,654
metal almost seems to bend and wave with your
movements. And as you turn back around to slash at

1669
01:44:17,654 --> 01:44:21,885
the wyvern, the blade cuts through it like butter,
there's not even resistance, it goes right through

1670
01:44:21,885 --> 01:44:27,457
its flesh. With each slash of the longsword, you
can see large chunks of its muscle coming visible

1671
01:44:27,457 --> 01:44:33,772
as parts of its body are now being pulled from the
muscle and sinew. It shrieks in pain, you can see

1672
01:44:33,772 --> 01:44:38,703
it angrily now starting to get ready to rake at
you pretty heavily. That end your turn?

1673
01:44:38,703 --> 01:44:39,911
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

1674
01:44:39,911 --> 01:44:42,297
MATT: All righty. Grog, you're up.

1675
01:44:42,297 --> 01:44:46,052
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to continue where I
started on, shitfucker out in front of me.

1676
01:44:46,052 --> 01:44:47,236
MATT: Okay! (laughs)

1677
01:44:47,236 --> 01:44:52,113
TRAVIS: But I would like to go Great Weapon Master
and I would like to use Reckless Attack.

1678
01:44:52,113 --> 01:44:53,113
MATT: Go for it.

1679
01:44:53,113 --> 01:44:54,960
LAURA: Wow, wow. Wow.

1680
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,395
SAM: Reckless.

1681
01:44:56,395 --> 01:44:58,290
MATT: Roll your first attack against him.

1682
01:44:58,290 --> 01:45:00,219
TRAVIS: That's a 31.

1683
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:09,136
MATT: Roll damage on that.

1684
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,707
TRAVIS: 25?

1685
01:45:10,857 --> 01:45:16,598
MATT: 25? He fails his save, so you get another
plus one to your strength, and that swing just

1686
01:45:16,598 --> 01:45:21,935
cleaves it in two. It goes (whoosh) right through
its midsection, it (gurgles). It tumbles off,

1687
01:45:22,009 --> 01:45:23,703
falling to the ground.

1688
01:45:23,703 --> 01:45:26,256
LAURA: Oh my god. Grog.

1689
01:45:26,256 --> 01:45:27,529
LIAM: Grog is full juicing.

1690
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:29,230
TRAVIS: I told you he'd open up to me!

1691
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:31,233
(laughter)

1692
01:45:31,233 --> 01:45:35,255
MATT: You can move in now with your movement and
do your next attack, if you'd like.

1693
01:45:35,255 --> 01:45:37,987
TRAVIS: I'll go ahead and take care of that wyvern
that's next to me.

1694
01:45:37,987 --> 01:45:39,713
MATT: Go for it, all right, so now you get your
next attack.

1695
01:45:39,713 --> 01:45:42,303
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1696
01:45:42,303 --> 01:45:47,458
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

1697
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:51,959
LIAM: Does his strength go up to 100 eventually?

1698
01:45:51,959 --> 01:45:53,844
MATT: It's double your first dice roll--

1699
01:45:53,844 --> 01:45:58,908
TRAVIS: 19-- oh, so the 2d6 was nine, plus five
is--

1700
01:45:58,908 --> 01:46:00,714
MATT: So 18.

1701
01:46:00,714 --> 01:46:02,376
TRAVIS: Plus 11.

1702
01:46:02,376 --> 01:46:06,011
MATT: So 29, plus two additional die rolls.

1703
01:46:06,011 --> 01:46:08,385
TRAVIS: Ten.

1704
01:46:08,385 --> 01:46:10,909
MATT: Okay. So we're at--

1705
01:46:10,909 --> 01:46:12,620
MATT, TRAVIS AND MARISHA: 39.

1706
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:16,857
MATT: And then one more? Because you roll 2d--
it's twice, because of Brutal Critical.

1707
01:46:16,857 --> 01:46:22,208
LIAM: Jeez, you got like Tetsuo arm, it's like
five times bigger than it should be.

1708
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:25,185
TRAVIS: Four. Four for those two, do I plus five
to that as well for the--

1709
01:46:25,185 --> 01:46:28,458
MATT: Well, plus ten for your-- you already added
that for your--

1710
01:46:28,458 --> 01:46:31,040
TRAVIS: Yes, 2d6 plus five on each one and the--

1711
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,015
MATT: No, it's just the additional 2d6 each time.

1712
01:46:33,015 --> 01:46:34,016
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1713
01:46:34,016 --> 01:46:39,731
MATT: So yeah, with that you turn around after
hacking its friend, leaping forward (grunts), foam

1714
01:46:39,731 --> 01:46:45,123
at the corner of your mouth, your eyes bloodshot
and angry. You take the blade and sweep it down,

1715
01:46:45,123 --> 01:46:51,113
and it plunges itself right into the wound that
Percy had left open with his sword swing, finding

1716
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:54,935
no resistance before it comes all the way to the
hilt in the body of the wyvern, which shrieks for

1717
01:46:54,935 --> 01:46:58,120
a moment (screeches) before its breath stops and
its body falls limp.

1718
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,178
SAM: Yeah, one down!

1719
01:47:00,178 --> 01:47:02,082
MATT: Does make its save, though.

1720
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:08,072
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, and on Great Weapon Master on a
crit or killing an extra hit, but I guess I--?

1721
01:47:08,072 --> 01:47:12,453
MATT: As a bonus action! For the record, going
forward, if you're frenzied raging it doesn't

1722
01:47:12,453 --> 01:47:17,301
really give you a benefit, but if you're not, it
does help. So in theory, you could if you wanted

1723
01:47:17,301 --> 01:47:18,703
to try and chuck it.

1724
01:47:18,703 --> 01:47:24,683
TRAVIS: (laughs) Just throw it? Don't throw it?

1725
01:47:24,683 --> 01:47:26,543
MATT: What are you going to do, Grog?

1726
01:47:26,543 --> 01:47:27,981
TRAVIS: I'm good, I'm good.

1727
01:47:27,981 --> 01:47:37,111
MATT: Ends Grog's turn. All right. Now these guys
both get up, currently no longer on the wyvern.

1728
01:47:37,111 --> 01:47:40,012
Did you want to give it another kind of a thought,
if you see it land?

1729
01:47:40,012 --> 01:47:42,952
SAM: Get on the wyvern and kill the other one.

1730
01:47:42,952 --> 01:47:50,603
MATT: Okay. This guy gets up on the wyvern, grabs
its reins, pulls it forward, and jams it with its

1731
01:47:50,603 --> 01:47:57,249
spear as it leads it inward. It runs forward and
is going to take a swing-- It's going to take a

1732
01:47:57,249 --> 01:48:01,376
swing with its stinger at the one behind it. It's
confused and figuring out what's-- why is it doing

1733
01:48:01,376 --> 01:48:10,862
this, it's more of like-- this might work once.
That is going to be a-- 17, it hits! That's going

1734
01:48:10,862 --> 01:48:15,748
to be 11 points of damage, does it make its save?
It does not make its save, that's an additional 24

1735
01:48:15,748 --> 01:48:22,806
points of poison damage on that one. So that's 35
points of damage, one wyvern to another. (laughs)

1736
01:48:22,806 --> 01:48:26,124
As this guy immediately whips around angrily.

1737
01:48:26,124 --> 01:48:27,934
SAM: You have pleased me.

1738
01:48:27,934 --> 01:48:29,786
(laughter)

1739
01:48:29,786 --> 01:48:32,434
MATT: Both of these guys go charging forward
here.

1740
01:48:32,434 --> 01:48:34,151
LAURA: Oh no, Scanlan!

1741
01:48:34,151 --> 01:48:38,392
MATT: It's going to pull up its javelin and chuck
it at you, Vex.

1742
01:48:38,392 --> 01:48:40,435
LAURA: Me?

1743
01:48:40,435 --> 01:48:49,632
MATT: Yeah. That is going to miss you at a 12. It
(swoosh) throws, the javelin arcs past you. This

1744
01:48:49,632 --> 01:49:00,037
one over here is going to come forward and it's
going to take a javelin as well out and chuck it

1745
01:49:00,037 --> 01:49:01,374
right at you, Grog.

1746
01:49:01,374 --> 01:49:02,641
TRAVIS: Heh, you're dead.

1747
01:49:02,641 --> 01:49:03,844
MATT: That is a 20 to hit.

1748
01:49:03,844 --> 01:49:04,861
TRAVIS: Hits.

1749
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:09,244
MATT: You take ten points of piercing damage,
reduced to five, as you basically (impact)--

1750
01:49:09,244 --> 01:49:11,045
TRAVIS: (snapping noise)

1751
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:14,007
MATT: (laughs) Snap it off and grin in its face.

1752
01:49:14,007 --> 01:49:19,247
TRAVIS: Let me return that favor in a second.

1753
01:49:19,247 --> 01:49:24,142
LIAM: Grog is on god mode.

1754
01:49:24,142 --> 01:49:27,643
MARISHA: (laughs) Save game plus.

1755
01:49:27,643 --> 01:49:35,707
MATT: (laughs) --now it sees the danger that
you're in, looks at you, sees you hack through the

1756
01:49:35,707 --> 01:49:39,094
center of one of the wyverns, intensely looks at
you and begins casting another spell.

1757
01:49:39,094 --> 01:49:40,247
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1758
01:49:40,247 --> 01:49:43,900
MATT: Like it is wont to do.

1759
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:46,308
MARISHA: Is it?

1760
01:49:46,308 --> 01:49:48,247
TRAVIS: Come on, smart Grog.

1761
01:49:48,247 --> 01:49:58,507
MATT: All right. So, Craven Edge, as you're
holding it, all of a sudden the handle becomes

1762
01:49:58,507 --> 01:50:10,227
white hot and you immediately take six points of
fire damage just holding it.

1763
01:50:10,294 --> 01:50:13,911
SAM: Grip it harder! (groan)

1764
01:50:13,911 --> 01:50:18,442
MATT: Fire's biting through. Three attacks against
you, Scanlan.

1765
01:50:18,442 --> 01:50:20,109
SAM: Oh, God.

1766
01:50:20,109 --> 01:50:24,758
MATT: Currently two of which are flanking you, so
they're going to have advantage on the attacks. So

1767
01:50:24,758 --> 01:50:27,921
that's a natural 20 on one of them.

1768
01:50:27,921 --> 01:50:35,684
This guy is-- 18. That hits. And then this
guy here without the advantage-- still hits with a 17.

1769
01:50:35,684 --> 01:50:38,502
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words on the last
guy.

1770
01:50:38,502 --> 01:50:40,054
MATT: Okay.

1771
01:50:40,054 --> 01:50:45,695
SAM: I'm going to just-- (plays flute badly) to
distract him.

1772
01:50:45,695 --> 01:50:47,727
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a d10.

1773
01:50:47,727 --> 01:50:54,503
SAM: d10. Which one's ten, I never remember. This
one. Nine!

1774
01:50:54,503 --> 01:51:00,455
MATT: Okay! So he rolled a 17 plus seven, that
would've been a 24, that brings him to 15, which I

1775
01:51:00,455 --> 01:51:05,175
believe misses you. So the last strike, as he
swings towards you, the shrilling tones, it causes

1776
01:51:05,175 --> 01:51:10,273
him to reach up and grab one of his lizard-like
ear holes and (snarling) the swing goes wildly

1777
01:51:10,273 --> 01:51:14,201
over your head. However, as you duck down, you
look up as you see the shadow come down of two

1778
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:21,729
large clubs that (boom boom) over the head of your
tiny gnomish form. That's going to be-- (groans)

1779
01:51:21,729 --> 01:51:23,600
SAM: Oh, that's not a good sound.

1780
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:29,783
MATT: Oh, and they also get bites after this, too.
All right, so you take 12, which would double to

1781
01:51:29,783 --> 01:51:37,218
24-- Oh, no, sorry, 12-- 20 points of bludgeoning
damage from one. You take 12 points of damage from

1782
01:51:37,218 --> 01:51:42,180
the other. So 32 points of damage total. And
they're both going to attempt to bite you as well,

1783
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:43,420
with advantage.

1784
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:45,259
SAM: A bite with advantage!

1785
01:51:45,259 --> 01:51:46,969
MATT: That is a 20 on the first one.

1786
01:51:46,969 --> 01:51:48,826
SAM: That's the damage it does?

1787
01:51:48,826 --> 01:51:54,504
MATT: That's to hit. And that one's going to --
double 19, so they both hit. So you take another

1788
01:51:54,504 --> 01:51:59,732
20 points of damage total of piercing damage as
they both start tearing into your body.

1789
01:51:59,732 --> 01:52:01,672
LAURA: 52 points of damage just then?

1790
01:52:01,672 --> 01:52:03,053
SAM: (rasping breath)

1791
01:52:03,053 --> 01:52:04,652
LAURA: No, Scanlan!

1792
01:52:04,652 --> 01:52:06,960
MARISHA: No, you're still up, you're still up! I
thought you said you had 55!

1793
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,374
SAM: I did.

1794
01:52:08,374 --> 01:52:09,540
LAURA: 52!

1795
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:10,687
MARISHA: It was 52 total.

1796
01:52:10,687 --> 01:52:12,287
LAURA: You have three points left.

1797
01:52:12,287 --> 01:52:27,153
SAM: Ah! That was close, guys. I saw my mother!
Then I saw myself at math class, failing.

1798
01:52:27,153 --> 01:52:30,694
MATT: I need you to make a bunch of concentration
checks here.

1799
01:52:30,694 --> 01:52:33,164
SAM: Oh yeah. Okay.

1800
01:52:33,164 --> 01:52:35,774
MATT: To maintain control over it, yeah.

1801
01:52:35,774 --> 01:52:39,153
SAM: Advantage on concentration checks.

1802
01:52:39,153 --> 01:52:40,585
MATT: Yeah, so just roll two at a time.

1803
01:52:40,585 --> 01:52:41,729
SAM: Two whats?

1804
01:52:41,729 --> 01:52:42,781
MATT: Two d20s.

1805
01:52:42,781 --> 01:52:44,675
SAM: Well, I only have one d20.

1806
01:52:44,675 --> 01:52:46,735
MATT: Adding your constitution modifier to it.

1807
01:52:46,735 --> 01:52:53,911
SAM: How many-- oh, for each thing that--
constitution modifier. Holy God. Okay. I'm

1808
01:52:53,911 --> 01:52:56,317
counting both of those, the first one's only 12.

1809
01:52:56,317 --> 01:53:03,012
MATT: 12, that'll work, because none of them--
only one of them did 20 damage and it's minimum of

1810
01:53:03,012 --> 01:53:05,620
ten, so as long as you get above a ten with each
one, you're fine.

1811
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:07,174
SAM: Okay. So I got to do two more?

1812
01:53:07,174 --> 01:53:08,353
MATT: Yeah.

1813
01:53:08,353 --> 01:53:09,939
SAM: Yeah, that's 16 plus two.

1814
01:53:09,939 --> 01:53:11,028
MATT: Okay. Another one.

1815
01:53:11,028 --> 01:53:12,534
SAM: 17 plus two.

1816
01:53:12,534 --> 01:53:13,816
MATT: Another one.

1817
01:53:13,816 --> 01:53:15,772
SAM: Two plus two.

1818
01:53:15,772 --> 01:53:20,081
MATT: You have advantage on these.

1819
01:53:20,081 --> 01:53:22,505
SAM: Seven plus two. Nine.

1820
01:53:22,505 --> 01:53:23,807
MATT: Nine. Nope.

1821
01:53:23,807 --> 01:53:25,310
SAM: No good. No bueno.

1822
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:29,052
MATT: With that, you lose your concentration on
the Domination spell. As that fades--

1823
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:33,307
LAURA: That's okay. The other wyvern is still mad
at the first one, so that's good.

1824
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:38,564
MATT: So that ends their turn. Vex, you're up.

1825
01:53:38,564 --> 01:53:40,555
LAURA: Oh man. Okay.

1826
01:53:40,555 --> 01:53:45,466
MATT: You see Scanlan being tossed around on the
ground, and then you see streaks of blood in the

1827
01:53:45,466 --> 01:53:47,906
air as one of them tears a big chunk out of his
shoulder.

1828
01:53:47,906 --> 01:53:49,025
LAURA: Yeah.

1829
01:53:49,025 --> 01:53:51,650
MATT: He looks up at you briefly, his eyes
half-open.

1830
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:54,317
LAURA: Scanlan! I got you!

1831
01:53:54,317 --> 01:54:03,018
SAM: No, no, I know you did. You shot me on the
last turn, I remember. Yeah, you got me good! You

1832
01:54:03,018 --> 01:54:03,911
got me good!

1833
01:54:03,911 --> 01:54:06,101
LAURA: I shoot from my Bow of the Sky Sentinel.

1834
01:54:06,101 --> 01:54:10,416
MATT: Sky Sentinel, I believe, did you use that
last battle?

1835
01:54:10,416 --> 01:54:11,826
LAURA: Fuck.

1836
01:54:11,826 --> 01:54:13,018
MATT: I'm pretty sure you did.

1837
01:54:13,018 --> 01:54:18,728
LAURA: I did, but I only used my burning thingy
once, so I can do that. Okay, okay, okay, okay,

1838
01:54:18,728 --> 01:54:27,523
okay. So I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to one
of the guys around Scanlan.

1839
01:54:27,523 --> 01:54:31,282
MATT: Okay. Do you want to say the most wounded of
them?

1840
01:54:31,282 --> 01:54:32,365
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

1841
01:54:32,365 --> 01:54:33,714
MATT: That would be--

1842
01:54:33,714 --> 01:54:35,273
LAURA: Or the least wounded of them, actually.

1843
01:54:35,273 --> 01:54:36,791
MATT: The least wounded would be this one.

1844
01:54:36,791 --> 01:54:42,346
LAURA: Okay. And then I'm going to shoot-- I'm
going to shoot arrows.

1845
01:54:42,346 --> 01:54:43,587
MATT: All right!

1846
01:54:43,587 --> 01:54:49,534
LAURA: All right. I'm going to shoot through my
Blazing Bowstring on that guy and the guy in front

1847
01:54:49,534 --> 01:54:50,496
of him.

1848
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,742
MATT: Okay. Right there and there?

1849
01:54:51,742 --> 01:54:52,680
LAURA: Yeah.

1850
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,570
MATT: So Blazing Bowstring, and then regular. Go
for it.

1851
01:54:54,570 --> 01:55:05,074
LAURA: Okay. So I forget how to do that. I roll to
attack. Why is this so hard?! Okay, 18!

1852
01:55:05,074 --> 01:55:06,592
MATT: 18 hits.

1853
01:55:06,592 --> 01:55:18,567
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to roll damage on that one,
which is ten plus my normal eight. 12, 14 plus six

1854
01:55:18,567 --> 01:55:24,835
for Hunter's Mark. 20 plus six for sneak attack,
bitch!

1855
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:27,590
LIAM: Did you just call the DM a bitch?

1856
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:29,168
LAURA: No, I was calling that guy a bitch.

1857
01:55:29,168 --> 01:55:31,717
SAM: Matt does not deserve that kind of language.

1858
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:33,933
LAURA: 6d6. So that's 25 damage against the first
guy.

1859
01:55:33,933 --> 01:55:38,836
MATT: 25 damage? That's just enough. Say goodbye
to him. That sneak attack was just what you

1860
01:55:38,836 --> 01:55:40,223
needed, that was the last bit of damage.

1861
01:55:40,223 --> 01:55:46,310
LAURA: Yay! Okay, so the second guy is another
18.

1862
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:48,302
MATT: Another 18? That hits.

1863
01:55:48,302 --> 01:55:57,934
LAURA: Actually no, that's a 20-whatever. Yeah.
Okay. 14, 15, 16. Do I get sneak attack on him, too?

1864
01:55:57,934 --> 01:55:59,514
MATT: Can only sneak attack once per turn.

1865
01:55:59,514 --> 01:56:02,279
LAURA: Dang it. So 16 damage against that guy.

1866
01:56:02,279 --> 01:56:07,609
MATT: 16 damage, okay. So this arrow-- The first
one hits it in the neck and he gurgles and falls

1867
01:56:07,609 --> 01:56:11,843
to the ground and bleeds out on the floor next to
Scanlan. The other one, the arrow strikes it in

1868
01:56:11,843 --> 01:56:16,363
the middle of its shoulderblades and it arcs up in
pain, but it's still standing. Though it's having

1869
01:56:16,363 --> 01:56:23,722
to really move around with much pain in its face.
That end your turn? You going to stay up there?

1870
01:56:23,769 --> 01:56:26,208
LAURA: I'm going to-- yeah.

1871
01:56:26,208 --> 01:56:31,004
MATT: Staying up on the rooftop, sniping down.
Good call. That brings us to Scanlan!

1872
01:56:31,004 --> 01:56:32,508
SAM: It's my turn?!

1873
01:56:32,508 --> 01:56:34,663
LAURA: Take a potion! Heal yourself!

1874
01:56:34,663 --> 01:56:40,481
SAM: Oh yeah! If I had a potion, that would be
great! I will do Thunderwave-- Thunderwave at

1875
01:56:40,481 --> 01:56:42,139
third level.

1876
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:44,903
MATT: Thunderwave at third level, all righty.

1877
01:56:44,903 --> 01:56:49,197
LIAM: Dissention in the ranks.

1878
01:56:49,197 --> 01:56:57,967
MATT: (laughs) Okay, so that is 4d8 thunder damage
to all the ones on a failed save. So, their

1879
01:56:57,967 --> 01:57:00,393
constitution saves here. Is this through a hand
cone?

1880
01:57:00,393 --> 01:57:01,849
SAM: Sure, man.

1881
01:57:01,849 --> 01:57:05,644
MATT: Figured-- both fail!

1882
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:07,375
SAM: What is it, 4d8?

1883
01:57:07,375 --> 01:57:11,638
MATT: It's 4d8 thunder damage. They are pushed ten
feet away from you.

1884
01:57:11,638 --> 01:57:14,808
SAM: Did they all fail? Did they both fail?

1885
01:57:14,808 --> 01:57:18,705
MATT: Yes. This pushed this way. This pushed that
way.

1886
01:57:18,705 --> 01:57:23,098
SAM: Ten. 17!

1887
01:57:23,098 --> 01:57:30,024
MATT: 17 points of damage to each. Okay! They're
blasted backward, barely catching themselves on

1888
01:57:30,024 --> 01:57:34,103
their feet. And from the impact, you can see what
little bit of red-colored leather armor they have

1889
01:57:34,103 --> 01:57:38,782
on is tattered and destroyed. You can see blood
pouring out of the sides of their earholes where

1890
01:57:38,782 --> 01:57:44,240
the thunderous blast possibly burst their
eardrums. And they're both like, shaking their

1891
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:51,301
head. All right.

1892
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:54,092
SAM: Bonus action, I will Healing Word myself--

1893
01:57:54,092 --> 01:57:55,499
MATT: (laughing) Okay.

1894
01:57:55,499 --> 01:57:57,603
SAM: I can do that at higher levels? Yes?

1895
01:57:57,603 --> 01:57:58,602
MATT: Yeah.

1896
01:57:58,602 --> 01:58:00,138
SAM: I'll do it at a level four.

1897
01:58:00,138 --> 01:58:01,207
MATT: (laughing) Okay.

1898
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:06,950
SAM: And I will sing to myself; sadly,
pathetically, (breathy) I get knocked down, but I

1899
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:09,901
get up again. Ain't never going to keep me down.

1900
01:58:09,901 --> 01:58:18,840
(laughter)

1901
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:22,916
MATT: All right! So that is 4d4 plus five healing
to yourself.

1902
01:58:22,916 --> 01:58:31,567
SAM: Okay, 4d4 plus five-- That's 14 plus
five.19.

1903
01:58:31,567 --> 01:58:35,470
MATT: 19. So you heal yourself 19 hit points. That
ends your turn. Up next, Vax.

1904
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:40,859
LIAM: I'm going to scramble up to the top of the
building that I'm right next to.

1905
01:58:40,859 --> 01:58:42,016
MATT: Acrobatics check.

1906
01:58:42,016 --> 01:58:49,337
LIAM: Sure. No problem. Yeah, way high. 20-- 33.

1907
01:58:49,337 --> 01:58:53,246
MATT: Yeah. You parkour up the side, land on top
of the rooftop. Leap across and you're now at the edge.

1908
01:58:53,246 --> 01:58:54,898
LIAM: Is that Percy right there?

1909
01:58:54,898 --> 01:58:56,250
MATT: That's Percy right there.

1910
01:58:56,250 --> 01:59:01,906
LIAM: Okay. Oh, who's right directly in a row,
away from me? Yeah, I can't tell. It's a bad guy?

1911
01:59:01,906 --> 01:59:04,292
MATT: It's a bad guy, bad guy. Bad guy, bad guy,
bad guy.

1912
01:59:04,292 --> 01:59:09,999
LIAM: I want to run, actually, and I want to jump
off and land next to Percy. Yeah. I want to run

1913
01:59:09,999 --> 01:59:15,859
straight by and I want to stab the dude. I'm going
to run forward, yeah. Stab that guy.

1914
01:59:15,859 --> 01:59:18,603
(laughter)

1915
01:59:18,603 --> 01:59:21,593
LIAM: Yeah, exactly. That is 20.

1916
01:59:21,593 --> 01:59:23,068
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

1917
01:59:23,068 --> 01:59:29,091
SAM: Run, run, run. Stab. Run, run, run. Stab.
Those are the two buttons on the Vax video game.

1918
01:59:29,091 --> 01:59:30,537
(laughter)

1919
01:59:30,537 --> 01:59:31,774
SAM: Run and stab.

1920
01:59:31,774 --> 01:59:32,757
LIAM: Nine.

1921
01:59:32,757 --> 01:59:33,596
MATT: Nine damage?

1922
01:59:33,596 --> 01:59:34,502
LIAM: Yeah.

1923
01:59:34,502 --> 01:59:36,527
MATT: (grunt) You shank him in the side and he
tumbles over.

1924
01:59:36,527 --> 01:59:37,871
(cheering)

1925
01:59:37,871 --> 01:59:42,659
LIAM: Run towards Scanlan, and I want to grapple
him. Hopefully he just takes it. No, not that far.

1926
01:59:42,659 --> 01:59:48,207
One square back. Right there! Grab him. And I'm
using my bonus action to dash and then drag him

1927
01:59:48,207 --> 01:59:51,098
backward, behind Grog.

1928
01:59:51,098 --> 01:59:58,003
MATT: It's an action to grapple someone who would
be against it, are you letting him grapple you?

1929
01:59:58,003 --> 01:59:59,308
SAM: Oh, hell yes.

1930
01:59:59,308 --> 02:00:00,683
MATT: I'll say for the sake of the--

1931
02:00:00,683 --> 02:00:03,803
LIAM: Right, two actions and a bonus action, mix
them around, Matt!

1932
02:00:03,803 --> 02:00:07,672
MATT: Yeah, it's fine, because he wants to. You
rush forward, you grab him, and you're dragging

1933
02:00:07,672 --> 02:00:08,969
him back this way?

1934
02:00:08,969 --> 02:00:12,457
LIAM: And then back-- yeah, right behind Grog, and
I drag him behind Vex and Grog, back by Keyleth.

1935
02:00:12,457 --> 02:00:14,002
(airplane noise)

1936
02:00:14,002 --> 02:00:17,363
MATT: Okay. I'll say that's about as far as you
get because you have a bit of movement taken away,

1937
02:00:17,363 --> 02:00:21,904
even though you are hasted, because he's not too
heavy, but he's still a gnome.

1938
02:00:21,904 --> 02:00:26,354
LIAM: Right. Dash-- hasted, I can go very very
far.

1939
02:00:26,354 --> 02:00:31,079
SAM: Your hands are so rough and masculine.

1940
02:00:31,079 --> 02:00:34,627
LIAM: I spank him on the ass and say, you're
welcome, shorty.

1941
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:39,984
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to push my way through
the crowd a little bit. Can I have that laser pointer?

1942
02:00:39,984 --> 02:00:41,406
LIAM: Yes, you may.

1943
02:00:41,406 --> 02:00:47,801
MARISHA: Thank you. Okay. (grandiose voice) And
now with all of the rage, thinking about all--

1944
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:49,871
SAM: "I turn someone into a chicken."

1945
02:00:49,871 --> 02:01:00,733
MARISHA: I-- boof! Boof! Boof! I want some
feather-down pillows for our loft. I channel all

1946
02:01:00,733 --> 02:01:08,914
of my Fire Ashari ancestors. And I cast my
7th-level Firestorm!

1947
02:01:08,914 --> 02:01:11,247
SAM: Oh god, we're all going to die.

1948
02:01:11,247 --> 02:01:18,586
MARISHA: So as I concentrate, enraged at the sight
of dragons, I have ten--

1949
02:01:18,586 --> 02:01:20,942
SAM: (whispers) Did you get me away from-- because
I--

1950
02:01:20,942 --> 02:01:24,151
MARISHA: Yes, you're fine. You're fine. No, he
didn't get you away because he knew this was

1951
02:01:24,151 --> 02:01:30,371
happening, it just happened to work out. So ten
ten-foot cubes-- They all have to be connected.

1952
02:01:30,371 --> 02:01:36,666
Exactly, I'm going to start here and I'll work my
way over. They're ten-foot-- remember, they're

1953
02:01:36,666 --> 02:01:41,996
ten-foot. But they're attached. So they're bigger
than that.

1954
02:01:41,996 --> 02:01:44,538
MATT: Three-- well, they're ten foot by ten foot,
which is about this size.

1955
02:01:44,538 --> 02:01:46,068
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

1956
02:01:46,068 --> 02:01:59,472
MATT: Right, so it's one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1957
02:01:59,472 --> 02:02:00,767
MARISHA: Oh, okay, yeah, get the wyvern.

1958
02:02:00,767 --> 02:02:02,107
MATT: You can get all of them there.

1959
02:02:02,107 --> 02:02:06,997
LAURA: Oh my god, that guy is going to be so--

1960
02:02:06,997 --> 02:02:08,939
LIAM: Grog's going to bite his head off.

1961
02:02:08,939 --> 02:02:13,366
MATT: What's the DC on this?

1962
02:02:13,366 --> 02:02:16,533
MARISHA: They have to make a dex saving throw or
they take--

1963
02:02:16,533 --> 02:02:18,630
MATT: Right, right, but what's your DC on it?

1964
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:20,703
MARISHA: Oh, my spell DC? 19.

1965
02:02:20,703 --> 02:02:32,357
MATT: Fail, fail, fail, they're not very dextrous.
Fail, fail, fail-- Fail! They all fail.

1966
02:02:32,357 --> 02:02:33,956
(cheering)

1967
02:02:33,956 --> 02:02:36,316
MATT: So that's 7d10 fire damage to each of them.

1968
02:02:36,316 --> 02:02:38,330
SAM: Why don't you use that all the time!?

1969
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:41,585
MARISHA: I just got it! I just got it when I
leveled.

1970
02:02:41,585 --> 02:02:44,627
LIAM: You've got to be careful with friendly fire,
and we're all out of the way.

1971
02:02:44,627 --> 02:02:48,652
MARISHA: So a giant, fiery chasm splits open.

1972
02:02:48,652 --> 02:02:54,429
MATT: The ground bursts open, rocks being torn
asunder as giant columns of flame-- boof, boof,

1973
02:02:54,429 --> 02:02:59,718
boof, boof, boof-- out of the ground, completely
engulfing each one of them in this sudden

1974
02:02:59,718 --> 02:03:06,268
conflagration of red and orange and yellow flames
and molten magma.

1975
02:03:06,268 --> 02:03:32,748
MARISHA: 24. 24, that was four-- 24, that's good,
so 27, 36, 30-- 42 points of fire damage.

1976
02:03:32,748 --> 02:03:36,104
(clapping)

1977
02:03:36,104 --> 02:03:38,187
LIAM: Phew. Gingers, man. Gingers.

1978
02:03:38,187 --> 02:03:40,843
MARISHA: My hands light up.

1979
02:03:40,843 --> 02:03:46,459
MATT: Each one of the lizardfolk-type creatures in
the flames, you see them shriek for a second

1980
02:03:46,459 --> 02:03:54,494
before their forms are turned to ash in these
blasts of fire, each sub-woofer-like, guttural

1981
02:03:54,494 --> 02:03:58,637
impact as the ground cracks open like (explosion
noise) scatter amongst--

1982
02:03:58,637 --> 02:04:00,380
MARISHA: So they explode? Popcorn?

1983
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:04,505
MATT: Yeah, each one of the wyverns themselves,
you can see the flames emerge around them, and as

1984
02:04:04,505 --> 02:04:10,129
it recedes they have burn scars and their flesh is
cracked and peeled against the fire wounds that

1985
02:04:10,129 --> 02:04:15,014
now tear across the front of their body. They're
all looking fairly hurt by that.

1986
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:21,526
MARISHA: And then, I take a bow.

1987
02:04:21,526 --> 02:04:23,222
(laughter)

1988
02:04:23,222 --> 02:04:30,007
MARISHA: And I'm-- exhausted a little bit, little
single tear as I think of my ancestors-- And

1989
02:04:30,007 --> 02:04:31,419
that's it.

1990
02:04:31,419 --> 02:04:33,334
MATT: All right, end of your turn. Percy, you're
up.

1991
02:04:33,334 --> 02:04:38,977
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to start walking
towards that wyvern at the bottom there-- Yeah,

1992
02:04:38,977 --> 02:04:43,375
that way, I'm not going to get quite close enough
to get into the reach of that jerk over there--

1993
02:04:43,375 --> 02:04:45,073
MATT: So you can go here.

1994
02:04:45,073 --> 02:04:49,640
TALIESIN: Yeah. While I'm walking by him, though,
I'm going to nail-- I don't even know if I'm

1995
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:55,357
really going to-- going to shoot him three times
while I'm walking by, because that's funny. With

1996
02:04:55,357 --> 02:04:56,485
Sharpshooter.

1997
02:04:56,485 --> 02:04:58,699
MATT: Okay. So first shot against them?

1998
02:04:58,699 --> 02:05:05,415
TALIESIN: It would be seven, 19.

1999
02:05:05,415 --> 02:05:07,625
MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on him.

2000
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:15,823
TALIESIN: That's-- 1d10, what did I do with my
1d10s, because I wasn't thinking-- here we go.

2001
02:05:15,823 --> 02:05:19,461
That's 26 points of damage.

2002
02:05:19,461 --> 02:05:23,633
MATT: (explosion noise) You take his head right
off as you walk by, without even looking.

2003
02:05:23,633 --> 02:05:28,197
(explosion noise, pained squawk) And you can see
the lower jaw gets blown off and it falls to the

2004
02:05:28,197 --> 02:05:29,310
back on the ground.

2005
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:31,776
TALIESIN: Since I've got two more shots, I'm going
to start shooting at that one dragon-- that

2006
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:32,929
wyvern, as I'm--

2007
02:05:32,929 --> 02:05:34,789
MATT: Right there? Go for it. Two shots on the
wyvern.

2008
02:05:34,789 --> 02:05:36,001
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter again.

2009
02:05:36,001 --> 02:05:37,163
MATT: All right.

2010
02:05:37,163 --> 02:05:38,708
SAM: Pew!

2011
02:05:38,708 --> 02:05:42,356
TALIESIN: That's a nine, yay! So that's 16?

2012
02:05:42,356 --> 02:05:43,578
MATT: 16 hits.

2013
02:05:43,578 --> 02:05:50,858
TALIESIN: And I'll roll the second one, just to
have it. That's nine. Nah, nine'll miss.

2014
02:05:50,858 --> 02:05:58,631
Thankfully will not-- that's great. 26 points of
damage.

2015
02:05:58,631 --> 02:06:01,176
MATT: All righty. This one (explosion noise) the
bullet hits inside of its body, you can see a

2016
02:06:01,176 --> 02:06:03,037
little (splurting noise) of blood squirt out--

2017
02:06:03,037 --> 02:06:05,571
TALIESIN: And I'll get as close as I can get to
him in this round, also, I'm going to spend my

2018
02:06:05,571 --> 02:06:07,249
movement walking straight towards him.

2019
02:06:07,249 --> 02:06:12,453
MATT: (heavy walking noises) That's the rest of it
there. Okay. That's your turn. Grog, you're up.

2020
02:06:12,453 --> 02:06:17,569
TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah! I leave one of those to you
guys, and I run at the two wyverns on the left.

2021
02:06:17,569 --> 02:06:23,950
MATT: Getting in the middle of the fray? Against
them both?

2022
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:25,458
TRAVIS: Yeah, against them both!

2023
02:06:25,458 --> 02:06:30,631
MATT: There you go! Grog charges, and they're
both-- There you go!

2024
02:06:30,631 --> 02:06:37,333
TRAVIS: Here's hoping these puppies go-- That's
24?

2025
02:06:37,333 --> 02:06:39,217
MATT: 24 on the more wounded one?

2026
02:06:39,217 --> 02:06:40,212
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2027
02:06:40,212 --> 02:06:41,455
MATT: All right, that hits him.

2028
02:06:41,455 --> 02:06:42,817
TRAVIS: Can I swing at the other guy?

2029
02:06:42,817 --> 02:06:43,708
MATT: If you want to.

2030
02:06:43,708 --> 02:06:48,427
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's divvy it up, I don't want to
give anybody too much love. Five, four, 26?

2031
02:06:48,427 --> 02:06:50,169
MATT: Hits, so roll damage on each.

2032
02:06:50,169 --> 02:06:57,914
TRAVIS: 11, 22, 32?

2033
02:06:57,914 --> 02:07:01,236
MATT: They're both Great Weapon Master? Okay, 32
damage?

2034
02:07:01,236 --> 02:07:02,609
TRAVIS: 32 on the first.

2035
02:07:02,609 --> 02:07:06,259
MATT: First one, you carve through him with the
blade (whump).

2036
02:07:06,259 --> 02:07:07,456
LAURA: Nice.

2037
02:07:07,456 --> 02:07:09,207
MATT: Makes his save.

2038
02:07:09,207 --> 02:07:17,453
TRAVIS: Five, ten, 21, 31, 31.

2039
02:07:17,453 --> 02:07:24,307
MATT: 31 damage? Okay. This one you (whoosh)
streak across with Craven Edge. Makes its save.

2040
02:07:24,307 --> 02:07:28,658
You leave a large wound across the front of its
jaw and it (choking noise). However, you did kill

2041
02:07:28,658 --> 02:07:32,239
one, so you do get to use your bonus action for an
attack because of your Great Weapon Master feat.

2042
02:07:32,239 --> 02:07:33,672
TRAVIS: Do I have to roll for the hit?

2043
02:07:33,672 --> 02:07:34,845
MATT: Yes.

2044
02:07:34,845 --> 02:07:41,166
TRAVIS: That's 31?

2045
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:43,585
MATT: With the minus five?

2046
02:07:43,585 --> 02:07:46,448
TRAVIS: Sorry! No, no, never mind, sorry, what's
31 minus five?

2047
02:07:46,448 --> 02:07:47,705
LIAM and TALIESIN: 26.

2048
02:07:47,705 --> 02:07:49,394
MATT: Hits, yeah, you're good.

2049
02:07:49,394 --> 02:07:55,991
TRAVIS: Okay. Three, seven, 12, 30. Oh, 22, 32.

2050
02:07:55,991 --> 02:07:57,667
LIAM: He's covered in ichor.

2051
02:07:57,667 --> 02:08:04,949
MATT: 32. This time (whoosh) you swipe through the
second time with the blade, this time carving off

2052
02:08:04,949 --> 02:08:08,902
part of its wing, and you see that one of the
wings is half-curled and keeping up to the side,

2053
02:08:08,902 --> 02:08:13,896
it's hobbling around its legs, looking like it's
on death's door, but still keeping itself. All

2054
02:08:13,896 --> 02:08:15,887
right, is that the end of your turn?

2055
02:08:15,887 --> 02:08:16,978
TRAVIS: That's it.

2056
02:08:16,978 --> 02:08:21,980
MATT: All right, (wyvern noise) in there, and this
one stays there and is going to unleash upon you,

2057
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:26,755
Grog. It's going to bite and tail attack against
each of you with the stinger against you, Grog.

2058
02:08:26,755 --> 02:08:29,384
That is a 21 to hit?

2059
02:08:29,384 --> 02:08:30,582
TRAVIS: Hits.

2060
02:08:30,582 --> 02:08:34,350
MATT: And natural 20 on the stinger, okay.

2061
02:08:34,350 --> 02:08:38,439
TRAVIS: Well, I have resistance against poison, so
that helps.

2062
02:08:38,439 --> 02:08:46,857
MATT: That does help, actually, so it'll just do
regular poison damage against you. So you take 11

2063
02:08:46,857 --> 02:09:00,093
points of piercing damage, reduced to six from the
bite. And the stinger deals-- That's 12 points of

2064
02:09:00,093 --> 02:09:01,685
piercing damage, reduced to six as well.

2065
02:09:01,685 --> 02:09:02,705
TRAVIS: Okay.

2066
02:09:02,705 --> 02:09:04,677
MATT: The stinger, however, I need you
to make a constitution saving throw.

2067
02:09:04,677 --> 02:09:09,202
TRAVIS: All right. Ugh, 12.

2068
02:09:09,202 --> 02:09:12,544
MATT: That's a failure. Actually, it would have
been an additional 12, because it was a critical

2069
02:09:12,544 --> 02:09:18,945
hit on the pierce, so you take 12-- so a total of
18 damage so far, and then, as part of the poison,

2070
02:09:18,945 --> 02:09:25,130
you take 48 points of poison damage. Because you
have resistance, that is reduced to 24.

2071
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:28,071
SAM: Hey! That's nice!

2072
02:09:28,071 --> 02:09:33,851
MATT: All right, you have poison resistance from
the belt, right? Yes. All right, so there you go.

2073
02:09:33,851 --> 02:09:40,900
The other one coming up against you, Percy,
strikes with its bite. That is going to be a 20-- 16?

2074
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,352
TALIESIN: 16 misses.

2075
02:09:42,352 --> 02:09:45,336
MATT: 16 misses. That is going to be a 22 for the
stinger.

2076
02:09:45,336 --> 02:09:46,498
TALIESIN: Stinger hits.

2077
02:09:46,498 --> 02:09:50,840
MATT: Okay, stinger hits you for six plus four,
ten points of piercing damage. I need you to make

2078
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:52,242
a constitution saving throw.

2079
02:09:52,242 --> 02:10:00,190
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. 20.

2080
02:10:00,190 --> 02:10:02,239
MATT: 20, you succeed. No poison.

2081
02:10:02,239 --> 02:10:05,253
TALIESIN: So I took ten points of--?

2082
02:10:05,253 --> 02:10:15,929
MATT: Piercing damage. Correct. All right, it's
looking rough on both their ends. They're just

2083
02:10:15,929 --> 02:10:19,100
fighting to the end at this point. All right, that
ends their turn. Vex, you're up.

2084
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:21,896
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the one
fighting--

2085
02:10:21,896 --> 02:10:23,244
MATT: Moving it over?

2086
02:10:23,244 --> 02:10:24,533
LAURA: Yeah. Percy.

2087
02:10:24,533 --> 02:10:25,902
MATT: All right.

2088
02:10:25,902 --> 02:10:29,807
LAURA: And I'm going to first attack the one
fighting Grog.

2089
02:10:29,807 --> 02:10:30,928
MATT: Okay.

2090
02:10:30,928 --> 02:10:35,529
LAURA: 16?

2091
02:10:35,529 --> 02:10:38,200
MATT: 16-- does hit, yeah.

2092
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:39,616
LAURA: Yes! Okay.

2093
02:10:39,616 --> 02:10:42,377
MATT: Don't have a whole lot of armor. They just
got a lot of hit points.

2094
02:10:42,377 --> 02:10:48,227
LAURA: 17 plus sneak attack-- 18.

2095
02:10:48,227 --> 02:10:53,897
MATT: 18. So Grog, as you're thrashing about with
the blade at this creature, eager to get that

2096
02:10:53,975 --> 02:10:58,335
final hit, you reach back with Craven Edge before
an arrow (impact) into its face and it

2097
02:10:58,335 --> 02:11:00,236
(burble, thump) collapses to the ground.

2098
02:11:00,236 --> 02:11:01,281
TRAVIS: Aw!

2099
02:11:01,281 --> 02:11:02,843
(laughter)

2100
02:11:02,843 --> 02:11:05,626
LAURA: And I shift my attention over to the one
fighting Percy!

2101
02:11:05,626 --> 02:11:06,792
MATT: All right.

2102
02:11:06,792 --> 02:11:12,293
LAURA: And that is 30, no, 28?

2103
02:11:12,293 --> 02:11:15,597
MATT: 28 hits, go ahead and roll damage with the
extra d6 for Hunter's Mark.

2104
02:11:15,597 --> 02:11:24,826
LAURA: Nine, ten, 11-- Where's my dex? 17.

2105
02:11:24,826 --> 02:11:29,373
MATT: Gotcha. 17 points of damage. second you
(whoosh) pull out the second arrow, (whoosh)

2106
02:11:29,373 --> 02:11:34,010
release it and it strikes the side of its body,
and (pained squawk) it still seems to be standing.

2107
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:37,468
It hurt it, but didn't leave it in any dire
straits yet. That ends your turn, are you staying

2108
02:11:37,468 --> 02:11:38,682
where you are?

2109
02:11:38,682 --> 02:11:39,962
LAURA: I'm staying where I am!

2110
02:11:39,962 --> 02:11:41,121
MATT: Okay, Scanlan, you're up.

2111
02:11:41,121 --> 02:11:45,589
LAURA: Actually, I'm going to jump off the roof
and rush over to Scanlan.

2112
02:11:45,589 --> 02:11:48,108
MATT: Okay. So leaping off, make an acrobatics
check.

2113
02:11:48,108 --> 02:11:53,158
LAURA: 24?

2114
02:11:53,158 --> 02:11:57,330
MATT: 24-- Scanlan, at the start of your turn, as
you're getting ready, all of a sudden (impact) in

2115
02:11:57,330 --> 02:12:02,331
front of you, spooking you momentarily, you see
Vex lands on her feet and looks down at you with a

2116
02:12:02,331 --> 02:12:05,835
look of concern and wanting to make sure you're
okay.

2117
02:12:05,835 --> 02:12:09,292
SAM: Oh, hi, thanks for checking on me. Could you
move for a second? I'm going to kill this thing.

2118
02:12:09,292 --> 02:12:11,262
(laughter)

2119
02:12:11,262 --> 02:12:16,888
SAM: Oh, so I'll-- I can't do much, because I'm
far away and I don't want to kill Percy--

2120
02:12:16,888 --> 02:12:19,036
TALIESIN: It's not going to live through me
anyway.

2121
02:12:19,036 --> 02:12:23,700
SAM: That's true. I will Wand of Magic Missiles
him.

2122
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:25,378
MATT: Okay, using how many--

2123
02:12:25,378 --> 02:12:28,827
SAM: I'll use six of my seven.

2124
02:12:28,827 --> 02:12:33,458
MATT: Oof! All righty. So go ahead and roll proper
damage on that.

2125
02:12:33,458 --> 02:12:39,096
SAM: Okay, the first, okay, so is that 6d4 plus
one?

2126
02:12:39,096 --> 02:12:44,479
MATT: This would be Magic Missile, cast at level
six, technically, I'm pretty sure--

2127
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:48,502
SAM: Well, it's weird, because my--

2128
02:12:48,502 --> 02:12:53,920
MATT: So it would be-- it would be 6d6 plus six.

2129
02:12:53,979 --> 02:12:55,851
SAM: 6d6 plus six?

2130
02:12:55,851 --> 02:12:59,142
MATT: Oh, I'm sorry. 6d4 plus six. Bleah.

2131
02:12:59,142 --> 02:13:00,671
TRAVIS: (chuckles) Heh, math.

2132
02:13:00,671 --> 02:13:01,746
MATT: Hey.

2133
02:13:01,746 --> 02:13:06,167
SAM: Sorry, it's close.

2134
02:13:06,167 --> 02:13:07,788
LAURA: Yeah.

2135
02:13:07,788 --> 02:13:16,010
SAM: One more? 12 plus what? Six? 12 plus six.
18.

2136
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:25,161
MATT: 18? Okay. The missiles (impact noises)
slamming into the side, arcing off and swirling

2137
02:13:25,161 --> 02:13:31,093
around Percy to hit it, anime-missile-streak
style, hitting it from all sides, you can see

2138
02:13:31,093 --> 02:13:35,243
chunks of its body being blown off from the force
of the arcane casting. It still stands, though it

2139
02:13:35,243 --> 02:13:38,269
is dripping from multiple wounds and is having a
hard time.

2140
02:13:38,269 --> 02:13:39,710
TALIESIN: I got this.

2141
02:13:39,710 --> 02:13:41,288
MATT: Ending your turn, Scanlan?

2142
02:13:41,288 --> 02:13:47,912
SAM: I think so, I mean, I'm okay. I'll heal
myself a little bit more with another level one

2143
02:13:47,912 --> 02:13:48,967
Healing Word.

2144
02:13:48,967 --> 02:13:50,804
MATT: Go for it, take your d4 plus five.

2145
02:13:50,804 --> 02:13:52,363
SAM: Okay. Seven more points-- yay!

2146
02:13:52,363 --> 02:13:53,528
MATT: You're up.

2147
02:13:53,528 --> 02:13:55,782
LIAM: I'm going to start walking towards it and
dagger, and dagger, and dagger.

2148
02:13:55,782 --> 02:13:57,056
MATT: Go for it.

2149
02:13:57,056 --> 02:14:00,116
LIAM: First is 20.

2150
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:01,489
MATT: 20 hits.

2151
02:14:01,489 --> 02:14:03,365
LIAM: Second is 23.

2152
02:14:03,365 --> 02:14:04,549
MATT: Hits.

2153
02:14:04,549 --> 02:14:05,804
LIAM: Third is a 23.

2154
02:14:05,804 --> 02:14:06,583
MATT: Hits.

2155
02:14:06,583 --> 02:14:08,009
LIAM: So, we get--

2156
02:14:08,009 --> 02:14:09,836
MATT: This is Sneak Attack.

2157
02:14:09,836 --> 02:14:11,970
LIAM: Ten for the fir-- Sneak Attack? Is it near
something?

2158
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:14,188
MATT: Percy is in melee range with it.

2159
02:14:14,188 --> 02:14:19,369
LIAM: Okay, so the first is ten plus-- wah!

2160
02:14:19,369 --> 02:14:21,423
LAURA: Oh no, dice down!

2161
02:14:21,423 --> 02:14:29,971
LIAM: Ten plus 16, 23, (growling) 29, 36, 39, 41
for the first dagger.

2162
02:14:29,971 --> 02:14:31,247
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2163
02:14:31,247 --> 02:14:32,463
(cheering)

2164
02:14:32,463 --> 02:14:42,134
LIAM: I will aim for its open mouth as it's going
"huah." And pin its tongue into the back of its skull.

2165
02:14:42,134 --> 02:14:47,483
MATT: As you step forward, your first dagger, you
pull it out and aim it and over-the-hand toss it

2166
02:14:47,483 --> 02:14:53,819
as it rears back, ready to bring its fangs out to
sink down into Percy, the dagger vanishes into its

2167
02:14:53,819 --> 02:15:00,943
throat, and you see its face go lax for a second.
(wet coughs) It begins trying to cough, and as it

2168
02:15:00,943 --> 02:15:06,946
does, you can see bits of blood and gore from its
throat being hawked across the ground. It takes a

2169
02:15:06,946 --> 02:15:10,736
few steps. Percy steps out of the way as it heads
towards you before it rears back and

2170
02:15:10,736 --> 02:15:17,665
(choking, thump) and collapses onto the ground. You can see
the blade still sticking out the back of its head,

2171
02:15:17,665 --> 02:15:21,047
towards the back of its throat, before it appears
at the side of your belt.

2172
02:15:21,047 --> 02:15:28,291
SAM: Sorry I made a noise, guys, sorry.

2173
02:15:28,291 --> 02:15:32,300
LAURA: Next time, stealth. We should get inside.

2174
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:33,487
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2175
02:15:33,487 --> 02:15:34,668
LAURA: We should hide.

2176
02:15:34,668 --> 02:15:36,966
TALIESIN: We should-- we should take what we can
and we should also hide the bodies.

2177
02:15:36,966 --> 02:15:38,474
LAURA: Good call.

2178
02:15:38,474 --> 02:15:40,808
TALIESIN: Let's bring everything inside.

2179
02:15:40,808 --> 02:15:44,080
MARISHA: I go down to the wyverns and I start
going for those stingers.

2180
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:46,125
MATT: Okay.

2181
02:15:46,125 --> 02:15:50,084
LAURA: If you can do this quickly, Keyleth,
because we need to hide these bodies.

2182
02:15:50,084 --> 02:15:52,252
MATT: It's going to take you a while to do it.

2183
02:15:52,252 --> 02:15:56,090
LIAM: Can I assist with my Keen Dagger, and help
her under her instruction?

2184
02:15:56,090 --> 02:15:57,624
LAURA: Let's get them inside.

2185
02:15:57,624 --> 02:15:59,862
LIAM: We're going to drag the wyverns indoors?

2186
02:15:59,862 --> 02:16:01,277
TALIESIN: Drag everything indoors.

2187
02:16:01,277 --> 02:16:03,760
SAM: Wait, wait, wait-- these stingers are on the
end of tails?

2188
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:04,798
LIAM and TALIESIN: Yeah.

2189
02:16:04,798 --> 02:16:07,157
SAM: Grog, can you chop off their tails and we'll
take the tails with us?

2190
02:16:07,157 --> 02:16:10,330
LAURA: No, we've got to get the wyverns inside. If
anything flying overhead sees these bodies, they

2191
02:16:10,330 --> 02:16:11,599
know something's been attacked.

2192
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:13,285
SAM: Aren't half of them burned to a crisp
anyway?

2193
02:16:13,285 --> 02:16:15,338
TALIESIN: Not crisped, just scorched.

2194
02:16:15,338 --> 02:16:21,521
MARISHA: There's some ash. I go ahead and I do a
cantrip, Gust, and start spreading out the ash.

2195
02:16:21,521 --> 02:16:28,533
MATT: Okay. It still looks like someone emptied a
bunch of fireplace ash pits into the center of the

2196
02:16:28,533 --> 02:16:30,675
walkway where there once were lizardfolk.

2197
02:16:30,675 --> 02:16:32,062
LAURA: I'll have the bag.

2198
02:16:32,062 --> 02:16:33,209
TRAVIS: What for?

2199
02:16:33,209 --> 02:16:34,857
LAURA: Just the Dust of Tracelessness.

2200
02:16:34,857 --> 02:16:37,637
SAM: I give us cover. I'll blow my Horn of Fog.

2201
02:16:37,637 --> 02:16:41,194
LAURA: I start putting the Dust of Tracelessness
down on the ground so it looks like

2202
02:16:41,194 --> 02:16:42,380
nobody's been here.

2203
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:47,651
MATT: Low fog sound as Scanlan blows the horn. Fog
fills the vicinity and you guys begin tossing Dust

2204
02:16:47,651 --> 02:16:49,156
of Tracelessness around--

2205
02:16:49,156 --> 02:16:53,315
TRAVIS: I go grab the humanoid figures and I throw
two over my shoulders and then I get one in each

2206
02:16:53,315 --> 02:16:55,876
hand and I start dragging them toward a door?

2207
02:16:55,876 --> 02:16:57,782
TALIESIN: Any-- inside. Just inside.

2208
02:16:57,782 --> 02:16:59,630
TRAVIS: To an "any inside."

2209
02:16:59,630 --> 02:17:03,134
LIAM: I'll get the door for you. (door creaks)

2210
02:17:03,134 --> 02:17:08,086
MATT: All right, you guys pretty quickly manage to
move what you can out of the way, we'll say over

2211
02:17:08,086 --> 02:17:12,205
the next few minutes the fog is there. Under that
cover, you begin to drag the wyvern bodies into

2212
02:17:12,205 --> 02:17:18,448
the alleyway, into the shadows. If you want to go
ahead and make some checks here to go ahead and

2213
02:17:18,448 --> 02:17:19,860
see if you can harvest.

2214
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:25,017
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, let's do different ones.
Okay, so first one, I'll definitely take

2215
02:17:25,017 --> 02:17:31,684
advantage, so, since I have advantage-- not that
much better-- 14. The first one.

2216
02:17:31,684 --> 02:17:34,333
LIAM: Would it help if I gave her my Keen Dagger
for the rest of it?

2217
02:17:34,333 --> 02:17:39,983
MATT: I would say, given the circumstance, all it
would do would offer her advantage, which she

2218
02:17:39,983 --> 02:17:47,165
already has, so it wouldn't make much difference.
So the first one, it's been a little too damaged

2219
02:17:47,165 --> 02:17:51,270
in battle and you aren't able to really draw any
poison from the stinger for the first one-- what's

2220
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:52,254
the second one?

2221
02:17:52,254 --> 02:17:53,718
MARISHA: Second one, 15 total.

2222
02:17:53,718 --> 02:17:58,913
MATT: 15's what you needed. You manage to extract
just enough of the wyvern stinger poison for

2223
02:17:58,913 --> 02:18:03,815
possibly a single dose, so you can mark down a
dose of wyvern poison.

2224
02:18:03,815 --> 02:18:12,799
MARISHA: Okay, I'll give it to-- I'll give that to
Vax. Do you have poison? Or do you-- Vax or Vex--

2225
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:16,396
I give it to one of the twins. Here, twins. You
fight over it. Fight over it.

2226
02:18:16,396 --> 02:18:18,292
LAURA: Is it good for you?

2227
02:18:18,292 --> 02:18:19,165
LIAM: Yeah.

2228
02:18:19,165 --> 02:18:26,466
MARISHA: Two more, maybe I can-- 14-- Okay, well,
the second one I rolled a 25.

2229
02:18:26,466 --> 02:18:29,403
MATT: Okay, so that's a second dose of wyvern
poison.

2230
02:18:29,403 --> 02:18:36,143
MARISHA: That I give to Vex. Last one-- I'll take
that 15, with-- 26.

2231
02:18:36,143 --> 02:18:43,513
MATT: All right, so you have three doses of wyvern
poison that you've managed to harvest from these

2232
02:18:43,513 --> 02:18:46,230
creatures; you guys can distribute as you see
fit.

2233
02:18:46,230 --> 02:18:49,036
TALIESIN: Anything else to loot from these
schmuckuses?

2234
02:18:49,036 --> 02:18:53,538
MATT: They don't carry much gold, and what they
have, you envision, probably went to the entity

2235
02:18:53,538 --> 02:18:58,025
that rules Emon. And as you're looking over the
bodies of the few of the lizard men here, you see

2236
02:18:58,025 --> 02:19:01,946
they didn't just wander their way in here. And you
remember mention from Allura before that there

2237
02:19:01,946 --> 02:19:12,886
were lizardfolk worshipers of Thordak years ago.
Apparently, once the city's been taken, Thordak

2238
02:19:12,886 --> 02:19:20,196
has, or at least the worshipers of Thordak are
also moving in. So, taking this time to harvest

2239
02:19:20,196 --> 02:19:27,247
poisons, looking over the bodies, you can see the
consistency between their red, crimson-dyed

2240
02:19:27,247 --> 02:19:36,751
leather materials, and you get the sensation that
while this was a small skirmish group, this is

2241
02:19:36,751 --> 02:19:43,740
probably the new policing state of Emon. So. With
that, we'll take a quick break for the restroom.

2242
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:46,503
We'll pick up here in just a few minutes, guys, if
you want to hang tight.

2243
02:19:46,503 --> 02:19:48,636
And we'll see you here shortly.

2244
02:19:48,636 --> 02:19:54,529
Jumping back in-- As the party re-gathers
themselves after the battle with these lizardfolk

2245
02:19:54,529 --> 02:20:00,172
and the wyverns in the center of the city of Emon,
you slowly make your way back through the streets

2246
02:20:00,172 --> 02:20:04,913
towards the north, passing through Abdar's
Promenade, finding the building that was

2247
02:20:04,913 --> 02:20:08,340
previously brought to your attention thanks to
Garthok.

2248
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:14,582
LAURA: Should we take a short rest, though, before
we head down to the Clasp? Because some of us have

2249
02:20:14,582 --> 02:20:15,839
taken some hits--

2250
02:20:15,839 --> 02:20:17,306
TALIESIN: We'll take a breath in the--

2251
02:20:17,306 --> 02:20:20,202
LAURA: Okay. Before we head down?

2252
02:20:20,202 --> 02:20:21,818
TALIESIN: Yeah. In the basement.

2253
02:20:21,818 --> 02:20:25,395
MATT: So you guys find the building that was
brought to your attention; you head down into the

2254
02:20:25,395 --> 02:20:35,113
same cellar, keeping tabs on the external trap
that was brought to your attention by Garthok last

2255
02:20:35,113 --> 02:20:40,984
time. You make your way inside. There's the same
barrel in the far corner; you pull the top off and

2256
02:20:40,984 --> 02:20:45,788
there, indeed, is a ladder that leads down
underground.

2257
02:20:45,788 --> 02:20:51,149
LAURA: This is why I left Trinket. Because he
wouldn't have been able to come down here anyway.

2258
02:20:51,149 --> 02:20:54,228
Just so you know.

2259
02:20:54,228 --> 02:20:56,020
TRAVIS: Hey, search that shit, Vax.

2260
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:57,693
MARISHA: He's very claustrophobic.

2261
02:20:57,693 --> 02:21:01,124
LIAM: So we've just got ladder down. That's it?

2262
02:21:01,124 --> 02:21:05,936
MARISHA: Well, hang on, let's heal up. I need to
hit dice it up as well.

2263
02:21:05,936 --> 02:21:07,727
LIAM: Well, I'm fine, so while everybody is--

2264
02:21:07,727 --> 02:21:09,649
TRAVIS: I would not like to take a short rest.

2265
02:21:09,649 --> 02:21:10,700
LAURA: Oh.

2266
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:14,098
TRAVIS: I lose all my Fancy Feast if I do.

2267
02:21:14,098 --> 02:21:20,840
LIAM: Just do some push-ups. Just do some push-ups
while I check this ladder out. So I'm going to

2268
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:23,496
check for any traps on this ladder or anything.

2269
02:21:23,496 --> 02:21:26,980
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah yeah yeah! Can she heal me
instead?

2270
02:21:26,980 --> 02:21:30,723
LAURA: I'll heal you. I'm going to heal you--

2271
02:21:30,723 --> 02:21:31,751
LIAM: 23.

2272
02:21:31,751 --> 02:21:35,942
MATT: Okay. Looking at the barrel, there are no
traps currently set, and it's not locked. The only

2273
02:21:35,942 --> 02:21:41,256
traps were on the outside of the cellar, from what
you knew previously, and as that mechanism had

2274
02:21:41,256 --> 02:21:43,942
already been shown to you by Garthok, so that was
easily disabled.

2275
02:21:43,942 --> 02:21:53,084
LIAM: I'm not going to go crazy, I'm just going to
go to the bottom of the ladder-- in I go.

2276
02:21:53,084 --> 02:21:55,643
MATT: Okay. So while you guys are taking a rest--

2277
02:21:55,643 --> 02:21:58,867
LIAM: 30 for stealth.

2278
02:21:58,867 --> 02:22:08,381
MATT: You drop down the ladder. As you head down
what probably comes to about 15, 20 or so feet

2279
02:22:08,381 --> 02:22:15,282
into pitch black-- it's completely dark down
there. Do you have any light source, or do you

2280
02:22:15,282 --> 02:22:16,483
want to--

2281
02:22:16,483 --> 02:22:17,952
LIAM: I have a Flame Tongue Dagger.

2282
02:22:17,952 --> 02:22:21,045
MATT: Okay, so you pull the Flame Tongue Dagger.
It puts out a very, very low candlelight, opens up

2283
02:22:21,045 --> 02:22:26,808
the vicinity to you as your feet splash down into
very, very shallow, a couple inches, shallow

2284
02:22:26,808 --> 02:22:33,848
water. Looking around you, you are in a
subterranean sewer system. The smell hits you as

2285
02:22:33,848 --> 02:22:40,219
you hit the bottom of it. This is the entire
underbelly of Emon, and there is the slight sound

2286
02:22:40,219 --> 02:22:44,003
of trickling water that's rushing through this
tunnel you're currently standing in. The ladder

2287
02:22:44,003 --> 02:22:50,491
drops close to about a foot above the floor before
it comes to a complete stop. Looking to your

2288
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:56,836
right, it descends a little further down on that
side, and you can hear-- make a perception check.

2289
02:22:56,836 --> 02:23:02,026
LIAM: 22.

2290
02:23:02,026 --> 02:23:09,284
MATT: Okay. To the right of you, what should be the
eastern tunnel, you can hear the sound of

2291
02:23:09,284 --> 02:23:14,622
trickling water growing louder; it's almost like
this stream meets another. As you listen to the

2292
02:23:14,622 --> 02:23:21,493
left, and the stench is pretty rough in this part,
to the left you can see in the tunnel is a very,

2293
02:23:21,493 --> 02:23:27,575
very faint dim, yellow light that is shifting ever
so slightly in the distance as it curves around

2294
02:23:27,575 --> 02:23:34,097
out of view. It is level to where you are now,
actually, slight incline for a little bit.

2295
02:23:34,097 --> 02:23:46,253
LIAM: (quietly) Vex'ahlia-- There is a long tunnel
down here and there is a bit of faint light. I

2296
02:23:46,253 --> 02:23:53,728
have Percy's fancy rock; I am not planning on
doing anything crazy, but I think I should--

2297
02:23:53,728 --> 02:23:58,180
LAURA: You don't have the-- the rock doesn't work
until we sleep. You don't have anything.

2298
02:23:58,180 --> 02:24:06,540
LIAM: Well, technically I do still have it.
Regardless, I should go ahead and, if there's

2299
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:10,434
anyone to talk to, I should talk-- I'm not going
to go yet, I'm going to wait 'til you guys have

2300
02:24:10,434 --> 02:24:17,799
rested, and come down to-- it's pitch-black down
here, I'm not running ahead. I'm better at this

2301
02:24:17,799 --> 02:24:21,647
shit than you and the rest are, so take a rest,
I'm going to sit here--

2302
02:24:21,647 --> 02:24:24,148
LAURA: You're better at talking than the rest of
us are?

2303
02:24:24,148 --> 02:24:27,343
LIAM: Sometimes, Stubby, yes.

2304
02:24:27,343 --> 02:24:34,821
LAURA: How will I know if you get into trouble,
and your hands are tied--

2305
02:24:34,821 --> 02:24:36,482
SAM: Do you need me to come?

2306
02:24:36,482 --> 02:24:38,355
LAURA: We can all hear you.

2307
02:24:38,355 --> 02:24:39,909
(laughter)

2308
02:24:39,909 --> 02:24:42,813
LIAM: Stubby, could you come down here for me?

2309
02:24:42,813 --> 02:24:44,128
MARISHA: Hi, Vax.

2310
02:24:44,128 --> 02:24:50,032
LAURA: Hold on just a moment. Mind the gap.

2311
02:24:50,032 --> 02:24:53,531
MATT: You splash down into the sewer system.

2312
02:24:53,531 --> 02:24:55,325
LAURA: Eugh, fuck, it smells down here.

2313
02:24:55,325 --> 02:24:56,537
LIAM: Yeah.

2314
02:24:56,537 --> 02:24:58,440
LAURA: Do I have to step in the water?

2315
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:01,705
LIAM: Probably. Come here.

2316
02:25:01,705 --> 02:25:03,492
LAURA: Yes?

2317
02:25:03,492 --> 02:25:20,815
LIAM: All right so, before all these guys-- you
were being stalked by someone, I don't know for

2318
02:25:20,815 --> 02:25:26,724
what reason, I don't know who the person was, I
don't know what they wanted with you.

2319
02:25:26,724 --> 02:25:28,832
LAURA: Stalked?

2320
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:43,355
LIAM: Someone wanted you, and I don't know who.
The Clasp was going to get you for them, and I

2321
02:25:43,355 --> 02:25:52,093
stopped that from happening. I followed you one
night, or rather, followed this person following

2322
02:25:52,093 --> 02:26:01,123
you, and met the Clasp. And I made an exchange for
your life.

2323
02:26:01,123 --> 02:26:03,200
LAURA: What?

2324
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:09,627
LIAM: I went and got someone else. And--

2325
02:26:09,627 --> 02:26:13,096
LAURA: And said it was me? No--

2326
02:26:13,096 --> 02:26:20,145
LIAM: Not immediately. You're almost on it. They
told me to get a body, I got a body. A living

2327
02:26:20,145 --> 02:26:36,801
body. A child rapist. And brought him to the
Clasp, and they brought out a stick-- really it

2328
02:26:36,801 --> 02:26:39,431
was made of human tongues.

2329
02:26:39,431 --> 02:26:41,616
LAURA: A stick. Of human tongues.

2330
02:26:41,616 --> 02:26:51,460
LIAM: Yes. They touched it, and he turned into
you.

2331
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:53,224
LAURA: What the fuck?

2332
02:26:53,224 --> 02:27:03,977
LIAM: And they took that guy. For whatever. And in
exchange for your life, I have this, and they are

2333
02:27:03,977 --> 02:27:15,095
allowed to call on me when they want. So, I know
that we've run in and out a couple of times, but

2334
02:27:15,095 --> 02:27:22,590
we're going in. You can talk my fucking ear off in
a moment, all right? Just shut up for a second. We

2335
02:27:22,590 --> 02:27:28,501
are going to go in and try to form some sort of
alliance or working partnership, this is different

2336
02:27:28,501 --> 02:27:35,238
than running in, smashing some shit and running
out, all right? So keep the cloak up, hang back,

2337
02:27:35,238 --> 02:27:38,028
don't say a lot, and you can talk my ear off
later.

2338
02:27:38,028 --> 02:27:44,589
LAURA: Okay, I will do that, I want to know that
tongue guy, that looks like me-- is he dead or is

2339
02:27:44,589 --> 02:27:49,119
he alive now? They gave him to some stalker, some
stalker!

2340
02:27:49,119 --> 02:27:53,515
LIAM: I don't know why you were wanted, I don't
know what it was about, all I knew is that they

2341
02:27:53,515 --> 02:27:58,961
were going to take you away and I wasn't going to
let that happen and I took some fucking piece of

2342
02:27:58,961 --> 02:28:00,435
shit and traded him in.

2343
02:28:00,435 --> 02:28:05,293
LAURA: So there could be at this moment in time
another person that looks just like me parading

2344
02:28:05,293 --> 02:28:07,140
around the world?

2345
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:13,532
LIAM: Well, if I had to wager on it, I'd say that
he's in a dungeon in a rubber suit, but I don't

2346
02:28:13,532 --> 02:28:15,353
know where, no.

2347
02:28:15,353 --> 02:28:23,822
LAURA: Well, thank you. For, you know, doing
that-- (nervous laugh)

2348
02:28:23,822 --> 02:28:27,506
LIAM: I never told you because it's creepy as
fuck.

2349
02:28:27,506 --> 02:28:31,169
LAURA: Was it the Clasp here, was it the Clasp in
Westruun?

2350
02:28:31,169 --> 02:28:32,773
LIAM: It was in Westruun.

2351
02:28:32,773 --> 02:28:34,988
LAURA: Well, these guys probably don't know me.

2352
02:28:34,988 --> 02:28:37,832
LIAM: Probably? Probably.

2353
02:28:37,832 --> 02:28:39,305
LAURA: I'll put my hood up--

2354
02:28:39,305 --> 02:28:40,904
LIAM: Stay at the back.

2355
02:28:40,904 --> 02:28:44,153
LAURA: I would like to find out who the guy was
that wanted me, though. That's kind of weird.

2356
02:28:44,153 --> 02:28:57,175
Thank you. For everything. thank you. You always
have my back and I know it.

2357
02:28:57,175 --> 02:28:58,852
LIAM: Yeah.

2358
02:28:58,852 --> 02:29:03,157
LAURA: And for that, I won't say very much.

2359
02:29:03,157 --> 02:29:08,624
LIAM: You do you, Vex'ahlia.

2360
02:29:08,624 --> 02:29:11,608
LAURA: Everyone can come down.

2361
02:29:11,608 --> 02:29:17,462
MATT: So as you finish your short rest, you all
progressively find your way down the ladder and to

2362
02:29:17,462 --> 02:29:23,515
the subterranean sewer system. The choice is to
travel to the east or western side of the tunnel.

2363
02:29:23,515 --> 02:29:30,911
LIAM: Sounds like there's, I don't know, drainage
or something coming from slightly up in that

2364
02:29:30,911 --> 02:29:32,085
direction.

2365
02:29:32,085 --> 02:29:35,154
LAURA: I'm guessing towards the light, is where
they are. Scanlan?

2366
02:29:35,154 --> 02:29:36,144
SAM: Oi?

2367
02:29:36,144 --> 02:29:41,918
LAURA: Do you have something that can make
disguises? Don't you have like, not the mustache,

2368
02:29:41,918 --> 02:29:45,287
but something that can really change my looks?

2369
02:29:45,287 --> 02:29:50,270
SAM: How do you know I'm Scanlan? I could be in
disguise, but yes I do.

2370
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:53,144
LAURA: Could I use that?

2371
02:29:53,144 --> 02:29:56,205
SAM: You would have to attune it to yourself-- is
that right?

2372
02:29:56,205 --> 02:29:58,386
LAURA: Oh, it takes like a little bit?

2373
02:29:58,386 --> 02:30:06,571
SAM: Oh no no no, requires attunement. What do you
think?

2374
02:30:06,571 --> 02:30:10,059
LIAM: Well, that's not a bad idea, but it means
we've got to sit in this stank.

2375
02:30:10,059 --> 02:30:15,747
SAM: I can instantly make us, with Seeming, I can
instantly make us all look different.

2376
02:30:15,747 --> 02:30:17,584
Or just you.

2377
02:30:17,584 --> 02:30:21,865
LAURA: Or just me. How about just me? I've got a
question, though. Here's the thing: if you think

2378
02:30:21,865 --> 02:30:25,322
that they know what I look like, don't you think
they know what you look like? Because you

2379
02:30:25,322 --> 02:30:29,756
look just like me. So what difference does it make
if I'm there or not?

2380
02:30:29,756 --> 02:30:36,048
LIAM: I don't know if the person who wanted you
was part of the Clasp. I don't know who it was.

2381
02:30:36,048 --> 02:30:40,940
It's parading you around in front of the people
who made an illicit deal with me.

2382
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:42,574
LAURA: All right, all right, all right. Seeming,
how about that?

2383
02:30:42,574 --> 02:30:44,083
LIAM: It could be fine. I don't know.

2384
02:30:44,083 --> 02:30:46,390
LAURA: Okay! Seeming?

2385
02:30:46,390 --> 02:30:48,201
SAM: Yeah, no--

2386
02:30:48,201 --> 02:30:49,542
LAURA: Please?

2387
02:30:49,542 --> 02:30:51,585
SAM: (smarmily) It's pretty high-level stuff--

2388
02:30:51,585 --> 02:30:53,472
LAURA: Scanlan, what if I heal you?

2389
02:30:53,472 --> 02:30:59,511
SAM: What if I-- ooh! I cast Minor Illusion and
give her a moustache. What about that? Is that

2390
02:30:59,511 --> 02:31:00,530
pretty good?

2391
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:02,955
MATT: A fancy, fancy moustache that you cannot
wipe off your face!

2392
02:31:02,955 --> 02:31:05,227
TRAVIS: Hey, that's very handsome.

2393
02:31:05,227 --> 02:31:10,184
LIAM: I don't think that's going to be enough.
It's not quite enough for our purposes.

2394
02:31:10,184 --> 02:31:11,935
SAM: All right, I dispel it.

2395
02:31:11,935 --> 02:31:13,749
LAURA: How about a limerick as payment, Scanlan?

2396
02:31:13,749 --> 02:31:15,380
SAM: A limerick for you?

2397
02:31:15,380 --> 02:31:16,653
LAURA: For you.

2398
02:31:16,653 --> 02:31:18,714
SAM: Oh! You're going to give me a limerick?

2399
02:31:18,714 --> 02:31:25,358
LAURA: I'll give you a limerick. Hold on. I've
been preparing it--

2400
02:31:25,358 --> 02:31:27,921
LIAM: She's multiclassing a third time.

2401
02:31:27,921 --> 02:31:32,715
LAURA: Have you heard tale of Scanlan the Bard? /
Or Burt Reynolds, if you look at his card.

2402
02:31:32,715 --> 02:31:37,480
Always tries to get laid / Sometimes with ladies
he made!

2403
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:41,587
But I still respect him, 'cause rhyming is hard.

2404
02:31:41,587 --> 02:31:45,662
(laughter, cheering)

2405
02:31:45,662 --> 02:31:47,917
SAM: That was excellent.

2406
02:31:47,917 --> 02:31:52,234
LIAM: Second firestorm of the night.

2407
02:31:52,234 --> 02:31:54,207
TRAVIS: Where's the extinguisher?

2408
02:31:54,207 --> 02:31:55,971
MATT: I will give you a d6 inspiration dice for
that.

2409
02:31:55,971 --> 02:31:57,712
LAURA: Yay!

2410
02:31:57,712 --> 02:31:59,060
SAM: Wait-- me or her?

2411
02:31:59,060 --> 02:32:00,221
MATT: Her.

2412
02:32:00,221 --> 02:32:09,090
SAM: Wow. That's impressive. Here's the hat. You
can use it--

2413
02:32:09,090 --> 02:32:10,531
LAURA: Oh, thanks, Scanlan.

2414
02:32:10,531 --> 02:32:12,622
SAM: In about 20 minutes you'll be able to use
it.

2415
02:32:12,622 --> 02:32:15,937
LAURA: I take off my circlet, I guess, and I put
on the hat.

2416
02:32:15,937 --> 02:32:18,362
LIAM: How 'bout that smell, everyone? Eh?

2417
02:32:18,362 --> 02:32:19,825
MARISHA: Did you live in this?

2418
02:32:19,825 --> 02:32:21,693
LIAM: I never lived--

2419
02:32:21,693 --> 02:32:23,891
MARISHA: Did you deal with this!? Oh, oh, that's
good.

2420
02:32:23,891 --> 02:32:28,616
LIAM: I'm, like, a distant cousin to all this.

2421
02:32:28,616 --> 02:32:31,519
(laughter)

2422
02:32:31,519 --> 02:32:38,081
MATT: In the time it takes for you to take the Hat
of Disguise and go ahead and attune to that, you

2423
02:32:38,081 --> 02:32:39,931
guys are now prepared. What path would you like to
take?

2424
02:32:39,931 --> 02:32:42,531
SAM: Towards the sounds, yes?

2425
02:32:42,531 --> 02:32:46,559
MATT: Well, you have the sound of water rushing to
the right, in the darkness, and you have the

2426
02:32:46,559 --> 02:32:49,643
sound, or, yeah, the view of slight moving light
to the left.

2427
02:32:49,643 --> 02:32:52,440
LIAM: But did you say, on the right, is it going
down, or is it coming down?

2428
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:56,778
MATT: The water is trickling downward; the water
continues sloping downward this way. The opposite

2429
02:32:56,778 --> 02:32:59,528
direction is where the light is. The little bit of
light you see in the distance.

2430
02:32:59,528 --> 02:33:01,165
TALIESIN: I say we follow the water.

2431
02:33:01,165 --> 02:33:03,822
LIAM: Follow the water down or follow the light?

2432
02:33:03,822 --> 02:33:06,177
MARISHA: Follow the water towards the light.
Right?

2433
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:08,253
TRAVIS: Jesus, what the fuck are we doing here?

2434
02:33:08,253 --> 02:33:10,072
LIAM: This is like the Underdark again.

2435
02:33:10,072 --> 02:33:11,932
SAM: I abstain.

2436
02:33:11,932 --> 02:33:15,524
LAURA: Let's go towards--

2437
02:33:15,524 --> 02:33:16,943
MARISHA: Towards the light.

2438
02:33:16,943 --> 02:33:19,153
TALIESIN: I'll do whatever they say.

2439
02:33:19,153 --> 02:33:21,229
MARISHA: Are we going towards the light or towards
the rushing water?

2440
02:33:21,229 --> 02:33:22,284
TRAVIS: Light.

2441
02:33:22,284 --> 02:33:26,454
MARISHA: All who vote "light," say "aye."

2442
02:33:26,454 --> 02:33:27,785
TALIESIN, LAURA and TRAVIS: Aye.

2443
02:33:27,785 --> 02:33:30,320
MARISHA: All who vote "water," say "aye."

2444
02:33:30,320 --> 02:33:31,575
TALIESIN: Aye.

2445
02:33:31,575 --> 02:33:32,941
MARISHA: To the light.

2446
02:33:32,941 --> 02:33:35,815
MATT: So you guys head-- left, or--

2447
02:33:35,815 --> 02:33:39,880
LIAM: Is there any-- I'm sorry, one last question.
Is there any Thieves' Cant on the walls at all?

2448
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:41,381
MATT: Make a perception check.

2449
02:33:41,381 --> 02:33:42,840
LAURA: Can I look, too?

2450
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:44,688
MATT: You know what, yes, you can.

2451
02:33:44,688 --> 02:33:46,184
SAM: With inspiration.

2452
02:33:46,184 --> 02:33:48,291
TRAVIS: Is there any poo on the floor?

2453
02:33:48,291 --> 02:33:50,620
LIAM: 31.

2454
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:52,977
LAURA: Oh, he doesn't need my help.

2455
02:33:52,977 --> 02:33:57,534
MATT: Looking along the walls, you start heading
in that direction, you do see a few markings that

2456
02:33:57,534 --> 02:34:03,696
basically say 'sanctuary' in Thieves' Cant, in the
direction of the light.

2457
02:34:03,696 --> 02:34:05,837
LIAM: All right. Confirmed.

2458
02:34:05,837 --> 02:34:07,908
MATT: You guys continue onward?

2459
02:34:07,908 --> 02:34:12,522
LIAM: Yeah, I'll lead the way. Yeah, we sat here
for 20 minutes in the stank.

2460
02:34:12,522 --> 02:34:19,119
MATT: Yes. (clears throat) So, you guys continue
forward up that tunnel. Eventually, as it curves

2461
02:34:19,119 --> 02:34:23,773
around, the light-- you can see-- it's shifting,
because it appears to be a distant fire light that

2462
02:34:23,773 --> 02:34:28,830
is the source in this vicinity, and as you turn
the corner, as the tunnel slowly curves around, it

2463
02:34:28,830 --> 02:34:36,180
opens up into a large central sewer chamber,
though most of it is dry, and you can see there is

2464
02:34:36,180 --> 02:34:40,905
a large mound of dirt in the center that seems to
rise above most of the water that has collected

2465
02:34:40,905 --> 02:34:46,832
along the ceiling, and there are a series of
platforms constructed out of wooden scaffolding at

2466
02:34:46,832 --> 02:34:51,630
different levels all throughout this chamber. Some
of it looks a little rickety, some of it looks

2467
02:34:51,630 --> 02:34:55,729
very old, but various states of moisture rot.

2468
02:34:55,729 --> 02:34:57,580
(offscreen sneeze)

2469
02:34:57,580 --> 02:35:00,001
MATT: You hear a sneeze from the distance from one
of the--

2470
02:35:00,001 --> 02:35:01,381
(laughter)

2471
02:35:01,381 --> 02:35:06,245
MATT: As you look and see a series of small
bonfires throughout the room that are currently

2472
02:35:06,245 --> 02:35:14,610
lit and surrounded by figures. You see a
ramshackle tent city, and/or a series of small,

2473
02:35:14,610 --> 02:35:19,661
wooden hovels that have constructed here. You see
a number of figures that are huddled around these

2474
02:35:19,661 --> 02:35:26,645
bonfires: cloaks, hoods up, generally keeping warm
in what is a relatively cold, subterranean area.

2475
02:35:26,645 --> 02:35:32,834
You guys, glancing over here, as you're first
looking, and you can see a few of them appear to

2476
02:35:32,834 --> 02:35:38,205
be laid up and hurt, and there appear to be at
least a few individuals that are heavily bandaged

2477
02:35:38,205 --> 02:35:47,235
or have slings on. As you guys step into the room,
not being very stealthy in your arrival--

2478
02:35:47,235 --> 02:35:57,915
LIAM: We could have been, but I use a bit of sign
language from the Cant, and let them know that I'm

2479
02:35:57,915 --> 02:35:59,524
part of the Clasp?

2480
02:35:59,524 --> 02:36:04,975
MATT: Okay. A few of them stand up, hands on the
side of their hilt, and stop there for a second

2481
02:36:04,975 --> 02:36:09,189
before one individual steps out of the shadows and
puts his hand up, putting it down. You recognize

2482
02:36:09,189 --> 02:36:10,482
this to be Garthok.

2483
02:36:10,482 --> 02:36:11,441
SAM: Garthok!

2484
02:36:11,441 --> 02:36:18,482
MATT: He says, "Don't worry, they're with me. I'm
glad you made it. It had been a while. I was

2485
02:36:18,482 --> 02:36:21,262
"afraid maybe you wouldn't come."

2486
02:36:21,262 --> 02:36:25,816
SAM: We got held up by some wyverns. I almost
died, it was crazy. We're here now.

2487
02:36:25,816 --> 02:36:27,486
MATT: "It sounds like it. I'm sorry to hear it."

2488
02:36:27,486 --> 02:36:28,887
SAM: Hey. It's all right.

2489
02:36:28,887 --> 02:36:33,422
MATR: "I'm glad you stayed alive." And as he
starts to talk, the group of individuals standing

2490
02:36:33,422 --> 02:36:40,526
about ten feet behind him separate as another
figure pushes past them. Pulling the hood back,

2491
02:36:40,526 --> 02:36:46,974
you can see a man about six feet in height,
average human height, long, blond hair that trails

2492
02:36:46,974 --> 02:36:54,813
past the middle of his back over a dark grey
cloak. Fine features at one time; he looks older,

2493
02:36:54,813 --> 02:37:02,386
you can see the weathering in his face and the
various wrinkles and lines from years and years of

2494
02:37:02,386 --> 02:37:04,286
living in this atmosphere.

2495
02:37:04,286 --> 02:37:05,692
LIAM: You said "human", right?

2496
02:37:05,692 --> 02:37:09,670
MATT: Human, yes. He has a red-tinted monocle over
one eye.

2497
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:11,368
SAM: Ooh! I like him already.

2498
02:37:11,368 --> 02:37:16,383
MATT: As he steps forward, the rest of the Clasp
put their hands off to the side of their weapons.

2499
02:37:16,383 --> 02:37:24,615
He pushes aside Garthok to the rest of you and
says: "So, you are the ones called Vox Machina, am

2500
02:37:24,615 --> 02:37:26,336
"I correct in this assumption?"

2501
02:37:26,336 --> 02:37:27,747
SAM: Yes, you are.

2502
02:37:27,747 --> 02:37:36,422
MATT: "Hmm! Trusted of Uriel, executors of Modeth
the Traitor. One among you is a member as well,

2503
02:37:36,422 --> 02:37:37,595
"I'm told."

2504
02:37:37,595 --> 02:37:39,037
LIAM: I step forward.

2505
02:37:39,037 --> 02:37:43,881
MATT: "Then you are welcome here. I am Spireling
Shenn--"

2506
02:37:43,881 --> 02:37:45,604
SAM: (whispers) Spireling Shenn?

2507
02:37:45,604 --> 02:37:47,327
MARISHA: (murmurs) He's a Spireling!

2508
02:37:47,327 --> 02:37:49,389
MATT: "Master of networks and information--"

2509
02:37:49,389 --> 02:37:50,656
SAM and MARISHA: Ooh!

2510
02:37:50,656 --> 02:37:58,422
MATT: "--of the Clasp of Emon. Excuse the mess, we
lost a portion of our territory and are currently

2511
02:37:58,422 --> 02:38:04,932
"caught in mid-adaptation. So, what can I do for
you?"

2512
02:38:04,932 --> 02:38:07,382
LIAM: Well, you know who we are.

2513
02:38:07,382 --> 02:38:09,643
MATT: "And you know who I am, now."

2514
02:38:09,643 --> 02:38:22,087
LIAM: Yes. And you know my spotty track record
with the Clasp. But that's all past now. The

2515
02:38:22,087 --> 02:38:27,163
city's in ruins. You're looking at the right hand
of Uriel.

2516
02:38:27,163 --> 02:38:31,941
MATT: "Uriel is no longer with us. You are a hand
to nothing."

2517
02:38:31,941 --> 02:38:47,283
LIAM: Of course. We're looking for what to do next
with this city. I don't think any of us wish to be

2518
02:38:47,283 --> 02:38:52,778
the pets of the beast that's now roosting in the heart
of Emon.

2519
02:38:52,778 --> 02:38:59,772
MATT: (chuckles) "No, that does not do any of us
any good. Business has ground to a halt, and we've

2520
02:38:59,772 --> 02:39:07,491
"lost a few good patrons in this unfortunate
circumstance. We lost our entire northern tunnel

2521
02:39:07,491 --> 02:39:11,094
"structure as soon as the creature attacked the
Cloudtop District."

2522
02:39:11,094 --> 02:39:14,917
LIAM: Well, I'll be honest, our first thought was
to flee this city.

2523
02:39:14,917 --> 02:39:17,380
MATT: "Safer."

2524
02:39:17,380 --> 02:39:23,054
LIAM: But before we make that decision-- yes, it
is-- we know that you're the next best thing to a

2525
02:39:23,054 --> 02:39:24,636
government in Emon.

2526
02:39:24,636 --> 02:39:26,215
MATT: "Hmm."

2527
02:39:26,215 --> 02:39:28,415
LIAM: And we want to know what's left behind.

2528
02:39:28,415 --> 02:39:36,369
MATT: "Well, we're seeing to our own. We're going
to see how many of our allies still lie within the

2529
02:39:36,369 --> 02:39:41,518
"city. Going to reach out to our friends across
Tal'Dorei and see how much of a network we still

2530
02:39:41,518 --> 02:39:51,964
"stand to keep. Then we call in a few debts, reach
out to some friends and, ah, we see if we can find

2531
02:39:51,964 --> 02:39:54,594
"some way to supplant this red thing."

2532
02:39:54,594 --> 02:39:56,487
LIAM: Can I insight check?

2533
02:39:56,487 --> 02:39:57,900
MATT: Go for it.

2534
02:39:57,900 --> 02:40:04,644
LIAM: Not good. No. Nine.

2535
02:40:04,644 --> 02:40:07,664
SAM: Nine, you said?

2536
02:40:07,664 --> 02:40:22,470
LIAM: Nine. The plan now is to lay low and hide?

2537
02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:26,963
MATT: "Well, for now, I have a number of
operatives topside who are currently trying to get

2538
02:40:26,963 --> 02:40:32,632
"as much information on the red one as possible.
The piles of wealth are growing, and it looks like

2539
02:40:32,632 --> 02:40:35,179
"the beast is building a damn home out of the
district."

2540
02:40:35,179 --> 02:40:39,383
TALIESIN: The city's going to need a black
market.

2541
02:40:39,383 --> 02:40:45,293
MATT: "Oh, I am aware, and we are preparing for
that. However, it's still fairly fresh, and

2542
02:40:45,293 --> 02:40:50,662
"individuals aren't willing to release any coin
when all of it goes to the pouches of the thing

2543
02:40:50,662 --> 02:40:57,523
"that sits on us. Word has gotten back that
Westruun was also hit rather hard in the night.

2544
02:40:57,523 --> 02:41:06,512
"And these creatures have continued eastward ever
since-- no further word on their whereabouts. So

2545
02:41:06,512 --> 02:41:12,397
"we're put in a reactionary position, which I
<i>loathe.</i> We're used to being ahead of the rest of

2546
02:41:12,397 --> 02:41:13,738
"the curve."

2547
02:41:13,738 --> 02:41:16,242
TALIESIN: Well, here's where we could help each
other.

2548
02:41:16,242 --> 02:41:18,706
MATT: "It would appear that could be a
possibility."

2549
02:41:18,706 --> 02:41:26,493
TALIESIN: We need this city to stay alive. We need
the citizenry to be fed, and we need people to

2550
02:41:26,493 --> 02:41:32,420
know where they're going to get their medicine and
when they're going to get their food. We

2551
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:40,957
understand it's going to be tricky. We need
information, we need spies, we need to know what's

2552
02:41:40,957 --> 02:41:44,645
happening in the city, and you need people like us
to stay out of your way.

2553
02:41:44,645 --> 02:41:52,946
MATT: "That seems like a fairly top-heavy trade in
our direction, if you ask me. There are many ways

2554
02:41:52,946 --> 02:41:54,905
"to get people out of our way."

2555
02:41:54,905 --> 02:41:58,395
TALIESIN: There are ways that we can benefit each
other.

2556
02:41:58,395 --> 02:42:00,289
MATT: "I would love to hear it."

2557
02:42:00,289 --> 02:42:02,257
SAM: (whispers) I would, too.

2558
02:42:02,257 --> 02:42:13,280
TALIESIN: We have safe haven-- and please, by the
way, stop me if you feel I'm being too broad.

2559
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:14,634
SAM: No, go for it.

2560
02:42:14,634 --> 02:42:18,189
TALIESIN: We have our keep that is untouched by
the dragon's attack-- we have a safe haven.

2561
02:42:18,189 --> 02:42:21,986
MATT: "Hmm. How is this keep accessed?"

2562
02:42:21,986 --> 02:42:25,395
LIAM: We can get to that.

2563
02:42:25,395 --> 02:42:28,376
TALIESIN: There are-- options.

2564
02:42:28,376 --> 02:42:32,386
LIAM: We also have strong connections to
Whitestone.

2565
02:42:32,386 --> 02:42:36,648
LAURA: And Vasselheim.

2566
02:42:36,648 --> 02:42:41,715
SAM: And to The Slayer's Take-- that's what
they're called, right? Yes? There could be a

2567
02:42:41,715 --> 02:42:47,115
formidable force that could come to protect the
city or drive out the dragons.

2568
02:42:47,115 --> 02:42:51,682
LIAM: We're proposing a short-term solution-- you
want to get back to a position where you can

2569
02:42:51,682 --> 02:42:57,888
grease the wheels and make money. That's not going
to happen anytime soon. But you can't take care of

2570
02:42:57,888 --> 02:43:01,952
these beasts on your own. And neither can
Whitestone, neither can we.

2571
02:43:01,952 --> 02:43:06,983
TALIESIN: But it is very likely that we will be
the thing that is dropped upon it from a great

2572
02:43:06,983 --> 02:43:13,635
height, and the most cooperation we can get,
getting into a position of power over this beast,

2573
02:43:13,635 --> 02:43:15,213
the happier we'll all be.

2574
02:43:15,213 --> 02:43:23,102
MATT: "Hmm. Let's say we do this, let's say we go
forward with this alliance. You get out of our

2575
02:43:23,102 --> 02:43:31,895
"way, you promise resources from Whitestone,
perhaps? They have quite a few unique

2576
02:43:31,895 --> 02:43:41,022
"contributions they could make. The Slayer's Take--
I have not had many dealings across the Ozmit Sea,

2577
02:43:41,022 --> 02:43:44,786
"but are you referring to, ah, Vasselheim?"

2578
02:43:44,786 --> 02:43:47,625
SAM: Indeed. They are a mighty force.

2579
02:43:47,625 --> 02:43:53,027
MATT: "Now, that is a tough nut to crack, that
city. If you're connected in Vasselheim, perhaps

2580
02:43:53,027 --> 02:43:54,428
"we can talk."

2581
02:43:54,428 --> 02:43:59,706
LAURA: There's no guarantees you'll be able to get
in anywhere.

2582
02:43:59,706 --> 02:44:03,161
MATT: "There's no guarantees we'll be able to
provide food or medicine-- it's dangerous times,

2583
02:44:03,161 --> 02:44:04,151
"my dear."

2584
02:44:04,151 --> 02:44:09,646
LAURA: It is. But the sooner these dragons are
defeated, the sooner business can get back to usual.

2585
02:44:09,646 --> 02:44:10,817
MATT: "Of course."

2586
02:44:10,817 --> 02:44:17,274
LAURA: Ow. I mean-- (fake coughs) eh.

2587
02:44:17,274 --> 02:44:22,420
SAM: I know I'm getting a bit ahead of ourselves,
but once the dragons are gone and the city's

2588
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:32,065
returned to normalcy, what is your ultimate goal?
To hold power or to remain in the underbelly?

2589
02:44:32,065 --> 02:44:40,654
MATT: "All the real power lies in the underbelly,
my friend. I have a proposition for you, then. We

2590
02:44:40,654 --> 02:44:44,320
"will do this. We have many channels and secret
tunnels throughout the city, and we could very

2591
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:55,284
"easily deliver food, medicine, shelter, even, to
the wired and poor and downtrodden folk of this

2592
02:44:55,284 --> 02:45:03,778
"town, be the subterranean heroes of Emon. Out of
the goodness of our hearts, of course. However,

2593
02:45:03,778 --> 02:45:09,686
"once this creature is toppled, and the city is
brought toward, I gather you would have the ear

2594
02:45:09,686 --> 02:45:12,080
"of whoever comes to power in this city."

2595
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:15,753
SAM: We may very well be the person that comes to
power in this city.

2596
02:45:15,753 --> 02:45:22,398
MATT: "That is helpful. And I imagine you also
have some presumably powerful connections in

2597
02:45:22,398 --> 02:45:31,679
"Vasselheim. We would be interested in beginning a
sect of our fair trade in that distant, all-too--

2598
02:45:31,679 --> 02:45:37,302
"how do I put it? Xenophobic cityscape?"

2599
02:45:37,302 --> 02:45:39,879
TRAVIS: What?

2600
02:45:39,879 --> 02:45:48,300
MATT: "If you agree to be our seed in that
stubborn garden of a town, you have our aid."

2601
02:45:48,300 --> 02:45:52,329
MARISHA: Can you give us a moment? (softly)
Please?

2602
02:45:52,329 --> 02:45:54,175
MATT: "My patience grows thin."

2603
02:45:54,175 --> 02:45:57,734
MARISHA: (whispering) Can we talk about this for a
second, guys?

2604
02:45:57,734 --> 02:46:00,269
MATT: He adjusts the monocle on his eye.

2605
02:46:00,269 --> 02:46:08,650
MARISHA: Do we really need them? Are they really
providing us with enough to make this worth our

2606
02:46:08,650 --> 02:46:15,272
while, to where we essentially want to open up the
Pandora's Box of crime in Vasselheim? Do we want

2607
02:46:15,272 --> 02:46:17,091
to be responsible for that?

2608
02:46:17,091 --> 02:46:21,794
TRAVIS: Well, I'm all about Pandora and her box,
but I don't think we really need this. It's not

2609
02:46:21,794 --> 02:46:24,801
worth all of that. Especially if we're going to
Vasselheim.

2610
02:46:24,801 --> 02:46:30,631
MARISHA: I feel like we just took one pretty
top-heavy deal and traded it for an even more

2611
02:46:30,631 --> 02:46:32,695
top-heavy deal not in our favor.

2612
02:46:32,695 --> 02:46:40,179
TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm not-- I feel the urge to
further discuss this. Also, to be fair, we're not

2613
02:46:40,179 --> 02:46:45,165
representatives of the Clasp; we couldn't,
technically speaking, open-- All we can do is-- I

2614
02:46:45,165 --> 02:46:50,750
think, the most fair thing to do-- to offer in
exchange for this is perhaps some trade with the

2615
02:46:50,750 --> 02:47:00,007
materials that are available in Whitestone and
maybe a promise of keeping a blind eye towards

2616
02:47:00,007 --> 02:47:06,420
their business until the finished reconstruction
of the city. Let them reestablish themselves until

2617
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:09,565
the city is properly completed.

2618
02:47:09,565 --> 02:47:11,016
LAURA: Don't say that.

2619
02:47:11,016 --> 02:47:14,464
TALIESIN: You need an underbelly. Underbellies are
function. Underbellies function for this very

2620
02:47:14,464 --> 02:47:18,916
need: the fact that we can actually get food and
medical supplies into the city right now if we

2621
02:47:18,916 --> 02:47:23,941
need to. Less than 72 hours after such a
devastating attack, there's no other system--

2622
02:47:23,941 --> 02:47:28,513
LIAM: If the Clasp were to vanish, something else
would take its place.

2623
02:47:28,513 --> 02:47:30,562
TALIESIN: They're inevitable.

2624
02:47:30,562 --> 02:47:33,601
LAURA: But I don't want to introduce them to
Vasselheim, no.

2625
02:47:33,601 --> 02:47:36,157
TALIESIN: At the cost of people starving or not
starving.

2626
02:47:36,157 --> 02:47:40,858
LAURA: We're already here, Keyleth.

2627
02:47:40,858 --> 02:47:49,414
MARISHA: I'm down for joining them and letting
them join our cause, and using their

2628
02:47:49,414 --> 02:47:53,412
infrastructure, but beyond that--

2629
02:47:53,412 --> 02:47:57,775
LIAM: Can I use perception to make sure that we're
really private right now?

2630
02:47:57,775 --> 02:47:59,471
MATT: Make a perception check.

2631
02:47:59,471 --> 02:48:03,452
LAURA: Can I join in?

2632
02:48:03,452 --> 02:48:06,322
LIAM: 22-- Oh, 22, plus can I use my inspiration
on this?

2633
02:48:06,322 --> 02:48:10,290
MATT: When'd you get that inspiration die?

2634
02:48:10,290 --> 02:48:13,262
LIAM: I got it in the wyvern fight.

2635
02:48:13,262 --> 02:48:15,366
MATT: It would've faded by now, unfortunately.

2636
02:48:15,366 --> 02:48:16,365
LIAM: Okay, so 22.

2637
02:48:16,365 --> 02:48:17,390
LAURA: 33.

2638
02:48:17,390 --> 02:48:18,705
MATT: 33?

2639
02:48:18,705 --> 02:48:32,817
You're far away from the crowd. However,
Spireling Shenn has been very concentrated in

2640
02:48:32,817 --> 02:48:37,852
shifting his attention from each person that is
currently speaking in this conversation.

2641
02:48:37,852 --> 02:48:38,990
MARISHA: He's reading our lips.

2642
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:41,819
LAURA: I turn my back to him and I say, he can
read our lips as well as I can.

2643
02:48:41,819 --> 02:48:45,140
TALIESIN: Of course he can, which is why I'm not
saying anything that I wouldn't want him to hear

2644
02:48:45,140 --> 02:48:49,295
anyway. I just don't want to promise anything we
can't deliver. I don't think we could deliver

2645
02:48:49,295 --> 02:48:53,119
Vasselheim; we're going to be busy! We have too
much on our plate as it is.

2646
02:48:53,119 --> 02:48:54,868
LAURA: I don't think they'd listen to us anyway,
honestly.

2647
02:48:54,868 --> 02:48:58,264
TALIESIN: I'm going to offer what we can give, and
see if that's enough.

2648
02:48:58,264 --> 02:48:59,965
SAM: We have to have something to sweeten the
pot.

2649
02:48:59,965 --> 02:49:01,056
MARISHA: Yes.

2650
02:49:01,056 --> 02:49:02,625
SAM: What are you offering, money?

2651
02:49:02,625 --> 02:49:08,031
LAURA: Offering to sweeten the pot-- we're
defeating a fucking dragon! Let them get back to normal.

2652
02:49:08,031 --> 02:49:10,750
SAM: We can't promise that! The dragon could very
easily kill us!

2653
02:49:10,750 --> 02:49:14,519
LAURA: We could say-- They certainly can't do it
without us. And we can't do it without them. But

2654
02:49:14,519 --> 02:49:16,371
we'll be bringing in other armies with us.

2655
02:49:16,371 --> 02:49:21,577
MARISHA: I agree-- it's joined forces at this
point, that's all we can offer them. A place to

2656
02:49:21,577 --> 02:49:22,616
fight at our side.

2657
02:49:22,616 --> 02:49:24,638
TRAVIS: You're still assuming he's going to keep
his word, too.

2658
02:49:24,638 --> 02:49:30,280
TALIESIN: Let me go back to him. (deep sigh)
Shenn.

2659
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:31,887
MATT: "Yes, hmm."

2660
02:49:31,887 --> 02:49:38,309
TALIESIN: I propose a counter-offer. I just don't
feel comfortable offering Vasselheim; I don't

2661
02:49:38,309 --> 02:49:43,690
think that we could necessarily deliver, and we,
honestly, have a lot to do.

2662
02:49:43,690 --> 02:49:50,728
MATT: "All I'm asking is an introduction to a
handful of key figures in the city, no more than that."

2663
02:49:50,728 --> 02:49:58,019
TALIESIN: Well, I will not promise that now. What
I can promise right now is some access to

2664
02:49:58,019 --> 02:50:07,808
materials from Whitestone, which-- and I show him
my gun hilt, which is embedded with the gems. I

2665
02:50:07,808 --> 02:50:12,782
can see what's still lying around, and we can make
a deal. I can also promise that for the

2666
02:50:12,782 --> 02:50:18,768
reconstruction, once this has been dealt with,
which is in everybody's best interest, until such

2667
02:50:18,768 --> 02:50:24,113
time as there's a functioning government in this
city, you will be treated with the respect

2668
02:50:24,113 --> 02:50:30,462
appropriate of a group of people who are helping
keeping the city functional.

2669
02:50:30,462 --> 02:50:37,148
MATT: "You act like that hasn't been our treatment
for the entirety of this city's existence. You

2670
02:50:37,148 --> 02:50:41,496
"think your council didn't have dealings with the
Clasp for many years before this happened?"

2671
02:50:41,496 --> 02:50:43,003
TALIESIN: Of course they have.

2672
02:50:43,003 --> 02:50:48,956
MATT: "We helped make this city function. All
we're offering is this service to other places

2673
02:50:48,956 --> 02:50:57,631
"that maybe don't have the right guidance to
achieve their true greatness. All I ask is an

2674
02:50:57,631 --> 02:51:05,598
"introduction. Beyond these other. Far after the
fact; don't even need to worry about it now. Who's

2675
02:51:05,598 --> 02:51:08,256
"to say what changes from now to then?"

2676
02:51:08,256 --> 02:51:11,300
LAURA: Who would we even introduce you to?

2677
02:51:11,300 --> 02:51:12,774
MARISHA: We don't even know anyone.

2678
02:51:12,774 --> 02:51:22,254
SAM: Yes, we do. We know some high-ranking
clerics. We know the Slayer's Take. We met a bunch

2679
02:51:22,254 --> 02:51:23,457
of people up there.

2680
02:51:23,457 --> 02:51:28,054
MARISHA: In a zealot city? You want to go to a
cleric and be like, "Hey. Thought you might want

2681
02:51:28,054 --> 02:51:30,540
"to meet the underground mob boss."

2682
02:51:30,540 --> 02:51:37,173
MATT: "We don't have to worry about that now. Just
a simple handshake, and it's all done."

2683
02:51:37,173 --> 02:51:43,582
TALIESIN: I'll put something forward to the group.
If they prove themselves honorable, if they prove

2684
02:51:43,582 --> 02:51:50,186
themselves faithful and capable of keeping this
city afloat, then we will speak to whomever they

2685
02:51:50,186 --> 02:51:55,078
wish us to speak to precisely of what they did. No
more, no less.

2686
02:51:55,078 --> 02:52:02,365
MATT: "If this is an issue of morality, I would
like to remind you that, one, we've let you escape

2687
02:52:02,365 --> 02:52:07,281
"after murdering one of our leaders, only upon
learning that he himself was an immoral

2688
02:52:07,281 --> 02:52:08,430
"individual."

2689
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:09,606
LIAM: You're welcome.

2690
02:52:09,606 --> 02:52:16,890
MATT: "Also, we went against our word as an
organization by letting you take a war criminal

2691
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:19,547
"that had already paid his way out of the city."

2692
02:52:19,547 --> 02:52:21,961
TALIESIN: And for that, we are grateful.

2693
02:52:21,961 --> 02:52:24,899
LAURA: And we gave you something very powerful in
exchange.

2694
02:52:24,899 --> 02:52:27,728
MARISHA: And you got to keep that man's money.

2695
02:52:27,728 --> 02:52:29,054
TALIESIN: That was business.

2696
02:52:29,054 --> 02:52:34,893
MATT: "It was business, but business that was
persuaded by the actions of good people, and

2697
02:52:34,893 --> 02:52:39,620
"bringing justice. We want society to thrive."

2698
02:52:39,620 --> 02:52:43,424
TALIESIN: I'm willing to kick this ball down the
field.

2699
02:52:43,424 --> 02:52:45,777
TRAVIS: What?

2700
02:52:45,777 --> 02:52:57,478
MATT: "So. Not wasting any more time, shall we
make this a fine, healthy city once again?"

2701
02:52:57,478 --> 02:53:03,495
TALIESIN: This feels a fair deal to me, and it
means that we can leave knowing that the city

2702
02:53:03,495 --> 02:53:06,992
will, in fact, still have a populace while we're
gone.

2703
02:53:06,992 --> 02:53:10,766
MARISHA: You seem used to selling your soul,
Percy.

2704
02:53:10,766 --> 02:53:15,062
TALIESIN: It is the job of ruling.

2705
02:53:15,062 --> 02:53:21,037
SAM: If we come back and learn that you have made
a deal with the dragons, you'll be the first to

2706
02:53:21,037 --> 02:53:22,250
die, not them.

2707
02:53:22,250 --> 02:53:27,176
MATT: "Oh. I would only hope that would be the
case. I wouldn't be caught dead dealing with such

2708
02:53:27,176 --> 02:53:28,872
"a selfish entity."

2709
02:53:28,872 --> 02:53:34,264
SAM: All right, then let's do this. Keyleth, shake
the man's hand.

2710
02:53:34,264 --> 02:53:35,765
TALIESIN: You don't have to.

2711
02:53:35,765 --> 02:53:39,565
SAM: You've got nice soft hands.

2712
02:53:39,565 --> 02:53:40,692
TALIESIN: Vax?

2713
02:53:40,692 --> 02:53:42,514
TRAVIS: It should be Vax.

2714
02:53:42,514 --> 02:53:45,013
TALIESIN: This is not the worst deal I've ever
heard.

2715
02:53:45,013 --> 02:53:47,397
MARISHA: You just don't know that yet.

2716
02:53:47,397 --> 02:53:49,450
MATT: "I have things to do."

2717
02:53:49,450 --> 02:53:51,411
TALIESIN: I have met the devil. That's not him.

2718
02:53:51,411 --> 02:53:55,364
LAURA: Don't do it.

2719
02:53:55,364 --> 02:53:57,676
MARISHA: Percy, you make me so nervous.

2720
02:53:57,676 --> 02:53:58,917
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2721
02:53:58,917 --> 02:54:02,684
MATT: "I haven't all day. My arm grows weary with
impatience."

2722
02:54:02,684 --> 02:54:03,729
MARISHA: Vax?

2723
02:54:03,729 --> 02:54:07,310
SAM: Would you like me to sing to give you some
extra strength for that arm?

2724
02:54:07,310 --> 02:54:10,502
TALIESIN: Vax, I will make the deal if you're not
up to it, but I want your blessing.

2725
02:54:10,502 --> 02:54:13,912
LIAM: You know what? Keep your deal.

2726
02:54:13,912 --> 02:54:16,426
TRAVIS: Yeah! Attaboy.

2727
02:54:16,426 --> 02:54:18,861
SAM: We're going to leave the city abandoned?

2728
02:54:18,861 --> 02:54:19,768
TRAVIS: Yes.

2729
02:54:19,768 --> 02:54:21,242
SAM: With no one to protect it?

2730
02:54:21,242 --> 02:54:25,058
MARISHA: We are not abandoning it. We already
discussed it. There's more than one way to cut

2731
02:54:25,058 --> 02:54:26,214
through this knot.

2732
02:54:26,214 --> 02:54:28,940
LIAM: I don't think you're going to let this city
fall, anyway. If this city dies, you've nothing.

2733
02:54:28,940 --> 02:54:30,079
MARISHA: I agree.

2734
02:54:30,079 --> 02:54:39,398
LIAM: If the parasite hasn't a host to feed on,
the parasite dies. No, thank you.

2735
02:54:39,398 --> 02:54:52,443
MARISHA: Percy? I'm sorry, but I think our methods
of being rulers might differ. I don't think I need

2736
02:54:52,443 --> 02:54:56,040
to sell myself for the greater good.

2737
02:54:56,040 --> 02:55:04,404
MATT: "Very well. Unfortunate as it is. Step
forward."

2738
02:55:04,404 --> 02:55:06,317
LIAM: Is this a whisper?

2739
02:55:06,317 --> 02:55:17,173
MATT: No, this is him asking you to step forward.
He steps really close to you, and he takes you by

2740
02:55:17,173 --> 02:55:22,637
the shoulders and turns you around to face away
from him. Do you resist?

2741
02:55:22,637 --> 02:55:30,188
LIAM: I'm going to roll out of his hands forward
to my friends.

2742
02:55:30,188 --> 02:55:38,858
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.

2743
02:55:38,858 --> 02:55:40,045
LIAM: 28.

2744
02:55:40,045 --> 02:55:50,264
MATT: 28. You tumble away from his grasp, and he
(grunts). "Very well. I know your face now, at

2745
02:55:50,264 --> 02:55:56,838
"least. And the rest of the Clasp will know you are
a false member, now. You are not welcome in these

2746
02:55:56,838 --> 02:56:02,050
"tunnels ever again, and if we see your face
amongst our kind, it will be our word that you are

2747
02:56:02,050 --> 02:56:07,637
"to be taken on sight. It's a shame you've marked
yourselves our enemy this day. I wish it wasn't

2748
02:56:07,637 --> 02:56:14,677
"this way. But to step up and confront us with such
disrespect for all the patience we've shown you in

2749
02:56:14,677 --> 02:56:23,275
"previous years is just-- it irks me. Stinks of a
lack of civilization. So please be on your way.

2750
02:56:23,275 --> 02:56:29,593
"We'll do as we do. You do as you. Now be gone."
And he turns around, flicks his cloak, and steps

2751
02:56:29,593 --> 02:56:36,247
back into the group. The rest of them keep their
hands on their belts and wait for you to leave.

2752
02:56:36,247 --> 02:56:41,389
SAM: I look at Garthok and say, "Even you?"

2753
02:56:41,389 --> 02:56:45,336
MATT: Garthok actually gives you a very stern look
and pulls his blade an inch from

2754
02:56:45,336 --> 02:56:47,584
the side of his scabbard.

2755
02:56:47,584 --> 02:56:51,361
TRAVIS: I wouldn't do that.

2756
02:56:51,361 --> 02:56:58,282
MATT: At which point, you can see 25 more Clasp
members step out. Even wounded ones as they are,

2757
02:56:58,282 --> 02:57:03,575
all stepping up and gathering. There are now 35 to
40 of them starting to form out of the shadows,

2758
02:57:03,575 --> 02:57:05,981
forming a semicircle around you entirely.

2759
02:57:05,981 --> 02:57:07,957
SAM: Don't do it, Grog.

2760
02:57:07,957 --> 02:57:09,260
TALIESIN: Absolutely not.

2761
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:10,695
MARISHA: Let's go. Come on.

2762
02:57:10,695 --> 02:57:13,210
TRAVIS: A fellow can't smile every once in
a while?

2763
02:57:13,210 --> 02:57:17,565
LAURA: We'll just back up.

2764
02:57:17,565 --> 02:57:23,547
TALIESIN: I take a bow, and I turn my back to them
and walk out.

2765
02:57:23,547 --> 02:57:28,805
LAURA: I do not turn my back. I walk backwards the
entire way out, with an arrow notched.

2766
02:57:28,805 --> 02:57:30,806
TRAVIS: I stay next to Vax.

2767
02:57:30,806 --> 02:57:37,226
SAM: I say, party on, Garthok. And then we
leave.

2768
02:57:37,226 --> 02:57:44,032
LAURA: Keyleth? Darling? Could you maybe make a
wall of stone and close off this tunnel?

2769
02:57:44,032 --> 02:57:47,053
MARISHA: Unfortunately, no.

2770
02:57:47,053 --> 02:58:01,416
LIAM: Save a thought for the people of Emon, if
you've any room left in your narrow minds.

2771
02:58:01,416 --> 02:58:03,995
And I back out.

2772
02:58:03,995 --> 02:58:13,099
MARISHA: I end with, hopefully, you will realize
there is a far greater enemy at hand than the

2773
02:58:13,099 --> 02:58:20,130
personal squabbles between us small people. And I
also step away.

2774
02:58:20,130 --> 02:58:23,749
MATT: The Spireling's not even in view at this
point. He's disappeared amongst the rest of them.

2775
02:58:23,749 --> 02:58:25,583
MARISHA: I'm sure he can hear me.

2776
02:58:25,583 --> 02:58:31,989
MATT: Possibly. As you guys exit and find your way
back up to the surface, as the last of you makes

2777
02:58:31,989 --> 02:58:37,915
it outside of the entranceway, you immediately
start hearing this slamming and breaking of stone

2778
02:58:37,915 --> 02:58:45,254
from underneath you, and you gather pretty rapidly
that this entrance is being entirely removed for

2779
02:58:45,254 --> 02:58:47,865
possible entry.

2780
02:58:47,865 --> 02:58:56,474
TALIESIN: I would like to point out, since you had
such noble intentions towards my position on

2781
02:58:56,474 --> 02:59:03,277
things, this is your ego at work here. I may be
many things, and I may be a deal-maker, but I

2782
02:59:03,277 --> 02:59:10,180
never forget that when I rule, I rule these
people, as well. I'm not better than them. And you

2783
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:14,474
may think you're better than them, but this is
what it creates. It creates enemies.

2784
02:59:14,474 --> 02:59:20,379
MARISHA: No, Percy. The difference is, I don't
think I'm better than them.

2785
02:59:20,379 --> 02:59:24,501
TALIESIN: They certainly think you do, and they
are not pleased.

2786
02:59:24,501 --> 02:59:31,138
LAURA: This mark. Is it magic? Can they trace you
through this mark?

2787
02:59:31,138 --> 02:59:39,094
LIAM: I don't answer. I walk over to Keyleth. Can
you still do the thing with your hands?

2788
02:59:39,094 --> 02:59:41,992
MARISHA: (fire noise) That thing?

2789
02:59:41,992 --> 02:59:52,325
LIAM: I rip my shirt down. I want you to burn it
away. Now.

2790
02:59:52,325 --> 02:59:54,171
MARISHA: Vex, do you have an arrow?

2791
02:59:54,171 --> 02:59:55,749
LAURA: Of course.

2792
02:59:55,749 --> 03:00:03,301
MARISHA: I hand it to him. Put this in between
your teeth. (sizzling noise)

2793
03:00:03,301 --> 03:00:08,917
MATT: (sizzling noise) Searing white pain through
the back of your eyes, Vax, as Keyleth presses her

2794
03:00:08,917 --> 03:00:15,459
palm into the center of your shoulder blades. You
can hear the sizzling and cracking of skin, and

2795
03:00:15,459 --> 03:00:23,300
smell the burning of Vax's flesh in the air in
this cellar. Make a constitution check.

2796
03:00:23,300 --> 03:00:25,882
LIAM: Seven.

2797
03:00:25,882 --> 03:00:34,851
MATT: Seven. You break through the arrow with your
grip, and actually give out a very loud, painful

2798
03:00:34,851 --> 03:00:36,778
scream out of reaction.

2799
03:00:36,778 --> 03:00:37,929
LIAM: Like you do.

2800
03:00:37,929 --> 03:00:40,025
LAURA: Similar to when you hit me in my arm.

2801
03:00:40,025 --> 03:00:45,766
MATT: Kind of. A moment passes. Keyleth, you pull
your hand back, and where the Clasp symbol once

2802
03:00:45,850 --> 03:00:52,064
was, there is a hand mark burned into the back of
the shoulders.

2803
03:00:52,064 --> 03:00:53,306
TRAVIS: Vecna.

2804
03:00:53,306 --> 03:00:55,670
(laughter)

2805
03:00:55,670 --> 03:00:57,010
LIAM: It was you.

2806
03:00:57,010 --> 03:00:58,535
TRAVIS: Kill her now!

2807
03:00:58,535 --> 03:01:01,506
MATT: What would you guys like to do?

2808
03:01:01,582 --> 03:01:05,520
SAM: Well, that was a bust.

2809
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:06,963
TALIESIN: That could have gone so much better.

2810
03:01:06,963 --> 03:01:11,103
TRAVIS: Vax, I think you made the right call, and
I don't think very often.

2811
03:01:11,103 --> 03:01:13,674
SAM: Or very well.

2812
03:01:13,674 --> 03:01:16,716
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2813
03:01:16,716 --> 03:01:19,763
LIAM: Thank you, Grog.

2814
03:01:19,763 --> 03:01:24,098
TALIESIN: I think we could have gotten out of
there with at least the hintings of an alliance,

2815
03:01:24,098 --> 03:01:25,512
as opposed to just--

2816
03:01:25,512 --> 03:01:26,900
LAURA: Straight up--

2817
03:01:26,900 --> 03:01:29,770
TALIESIN: Bitter enemies. This was a disaster.

2818
03:01:29,770 --> 03:01:34,659
TRAVIS: Sometimes you have to walk away from a bad
deal to find a good one.

2819
03:01:34,659 --> 03:01:36,614
SAM: That's not a thing.

2820
03:01:36,614 --> 03:01:41,203
TALIESIN: That's not a thing. Where did-- you
didn't read that--

2821
03:01:41,203 --> 03:01:42,812
MARISHA: I got what you were saying, Grog.

2822
03:01:42,812 --> 03:01:46,662
TRAVIS: When it rains, the sun is shining.

2823
03:01:46,662 --> 03:01:49,980
LAURA: That's deep, Grog. I like it.

2824
03:01:49,980 --> 03:01:51,555
TRAVIS: Stew on that.

2825
03:01:51,555 --> 03:01:52,924
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on--

2826
03:01:52,924 --> 03:01:53,997
LIAM: No!

2827
03:01:53,997 --> 03:01:57,004
LAURA: I already did it. Too late! I fucking
touched you, fucker.

2828
03:01:57,004 --> 03:01:58,504
LIAM: Does that take the scar?

2829
03:01:58,504 --> 03:02:01,072
LAURA: It just takes the pain away.

2830
03:02:01,072 --> 03:02:07,777
MATT: Cure Wounds? What it does is prevents
infection. It does heal you for the hit points you

2831
03:02:07,777 --> 03:02:10,919
would have lost for that. I'll say it nullifies
the damage you would have taken from the burn

2832
03:02:10,919 --> 03:02:15,818
mark. It does not alleviate you from the scarring.
It's not as graphic as it would have been, had it

2833
03:02:15,818 --> 03:02:21,484
been left to heal on its own, but it does muddle
the Clasp symbol somewhat.

2834
03:02:21,484 --> 03:02:24,423
LIAM: Okay. Thank you.

2835
03:02:24,423 --> 03:02:27,423
SAM: Shall we go back to our keep?

2836
03:02:27,423 --> 03:02:31,345
TRAVIS: We could just kill them all now.

2837
03:02:31,345 --> 03:02:34,168
LIAM: There's hundreds of them, Grog.

2838
03:02:34,168 --> 03:02:35,811
TALIESIN: (splutters) No, we can't.

2839
03:02:35,811 --> 03:02:37,381
TRAVIS: I saw, like, 40 or 50.

2840
03:02:37,381 --> 03:02:40,287
LIAM: Yeah, there were another 160 in the
rafters.

2841
03:02:40,287 --> 03:02:46,153
TALIESIN: It would do no good. Who would be
bringing food into the city in the first place?

2842
03:02:46,153 --> 03:02:51,057
LIAM: They're going to go on doing the same thing
they would have done with us or without us.

2843
03:02:51,057 --> 03:02:53,419
TALIESIN: They're doing it without us, though.

2844
03:02:53,419 --> 03:02:59,608
MARISHA: But Percy, do you honestly think that
after all of this was done-- do you want to be

2845
03:02:59,608 --> 03:03:01,425
beholden to those people?

2846
03:03:01,425 --> 03:03:07,329
LIAM: And I don't believe they are going to bend
the knee to Thordak. I don't believe it.

2847
03:03:07,329 --> 03:03:09,380
TALIESIN: They're not going to, no. Of course
not.

2848
03:03:09,380 --> 03:03:11,877
LIAM: And that was all I, personally, was worried
about.

2849
03:03:11,877 --> 03:03:17,760
TALIESIN: I wanted people on the inside keeping us
informed, and we just lost a

2850
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:19,517
very powerful spy network.

2851
03:03:19,517 --> 03:03:22,263
LIAM: I think the only people on the inside right
now have scales.

2852
03:03:22,263 --> 03:03:26,063
TALIESIN: Everybody needs something.

2853
03:03:26,063 --> 03:03:29,712
LAURA: Can we go back to the keep?

2854
03:03:29,712 --> 03:03:37,111
TALIESIN: We are not going to bother. We're going
to go and we're going to find a way of killing

2855
03:03:37,111 --> 03:03:41,342
these things, and we're going to hope for the best
in this city. That's what we're going to do.

2856
03:03:41,342 --> 03:03:45,059
MATT: As you guys are heading back, I need stealth
checks from everybody.

2857
03:03:45,059 --> 03:03:47,211
LAURA: Stealth check. Pass Without a Trace.

2858
03:03:47,211 --> 03:03:53,604
MARISHA: Fuck! Natural one.

2859
03:03:53,604 --> 03:03:55,284
TALIESIN: Oh my god, really?

2860
03:03:55,284 --> 03:03:57,567
MARISHA: Natural one.

2861
03:03:57,567 --> 03:04:01,347
LAURA: Then what's the point of anybody rolling?

2862
03:04:01,347 --> 03:04:02,432
LIAM: 27.

2863
03:04:02,432 --> 03:04:03,514
SAM: 19.

2864
03:04:03,514 --> 03:04:05,124
LAURA: 37.

2865
03:04:05,124 --> 03:04:06,564
TRAVIS: 29.

2866
03:04:06,564 --> 03:04:08,895
TALIESIN: We have a plus ten? 33.

2867
03:04:08,895 --> 03:04:16,472
MATT: All right. You guys push southward through
the city, finding your way. At this point, the sun

2868
03:04:16,472 --> 03:04:22,654
has set. Night has come in, and occasionally you
hear the flapping of leathery wings overhead as a

2869
03:04:22,654 --> 03:04:32,400
number of sentry groups of wyvern riders go
tearing through the city. At one point, you hear a

2870
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:40,471
similar (raspy cry) sound, and you hear other ones
begin rising up off the rooftops, heading in your

2871
03:04:40,471 --> 03:04:45,166
direction, Keyleth. What do you guys do?

2872
03:04:45,166 --> 03:04:50,812
TALIESIN: The minute we see that, I'm going to
push her against the wall, and I'm going to Minor

2873
03:04:50,812 --> 03:04:52,643
Illusion a shadow right over her.

2874
03:04:52,643 --> 03:04:56,817
MATT: Okay. Make a new stealth check with
disadvantage.

2875
03:04:56,817 --> 03:04:58,719
LAURA: Add ten.

2876
03:04:58,719 --> 03:05:05,190
MATT: (chuckles) It's a natural one on their end.

2877
03:05:05,190 --> 03:05:06,655
MARISHA: Oh, good.

2878
03:05:06,655 --> 03:05:07,973
MATT: As long as you didn't roll a natural one.

2879
03:05:07,973 --> 03:05:11,269
MARISHA: No, I didn't, I rolled an eight, plus a
seven, plus ten.

2880
03:05:11,269 --> 03:05:15,757
MATT: So, at that point, they (whoosh), one swoops
down and lands on the edge of the roof, and you

2881
03:05:15,757 --> 03:05:29,548
see it curling down. And takes off again, and they
continue on, out of the way. You wait a few

2882
03:05:29,548 --> 03:05:34,258
moments before silence takes the night once more,
and you press on heading southward.

2883
03:05:34,258 --> 03:05:37,709
(laughter)

2884
03:05:37,709 --> 03:05:39,001
LAURA: Nice.

2885
03:05:39,001 --> 03:05:40,045
SAM: Good job, Percy.

2886
03:05:40,045 --> 03:05:41,612
MARISHA: Thank you, Percy.

2887
03:05:41,612 --> 03:05:44,412
TALIESIN: One day you're going to stop being
afraid of me, by the way, and I hope that day

2888
03:05:44,412 --> 03:05:45,648
comes soon.

2889
03:05:45,648 --> 03:05:51,655
SAM: Before we go to the keep, do you want to
swing by the place?

2890
03:05:51,655 --> 03:05:53,148
TALIESIN: The place?

2891
03:05:53,148 --> 03:05:54,924
SAM: The place with the airships.

2892
03:05:54,924 --> 03:06:00,338
TALIESIN: There's no "swinging by," that's a
caper. That's an entire thing,

2893
03:06:00,338 --> 03:06:01,359
that if we're going to do--

2894
03:06:01,359 --> 03:06:03,154
SAM: Just to go there and look?

2895
03:06:03,154 --> 03:06:07,601
TRAVIS: The showroom is fucked. It's broken.

2896
03:06:07,601 --> 03:06:12,684
TALIESIN: This is one of those things that we're
going to have to get everybody on board before we

2897
03:06:12,684 --> 03:06:15,915
even start talking about it, so probably a good
night's sleep.

2898
03:06:15,915 --> 03:06:17,148
SAM: All right.

2899
03:06:17,148 --> 03:06:19,160
LAURA: We need to sleep. We need to get up in the
morning--

2900
03:06:19,160 --> 03:06:22,762
TALIESIN: And then we'll talk about an airship.
I'm really on board with the airship.

2901
03:06:22,762 --> 03:06:24,717
SAM: All right.

2902
03:06:24,717 --> 03:06:27,460
LAURA: I think we need to go to Vasselheim or
Whitestone.

2903
03:06:27,460 --> 03:06:29,052
TRAVIS: Vasselheim.

2904
03:06:29,052 --> 03:06:31,101
LIAM: We don't need an airship to do that.

2905
03:06:31,101 --> 03:06:35,544
LAURA: No, we don't. But we also need to find out
what's happening with Allura in Whiterun.

2906
03:06:35,544 --> 03:06:37,678
Westruun. All those cities.

2907
03:06:37,678 --> 03:06:46,797
SAM: All right. Back to the keep then, I guess.
When we get there can we check in on Gilmore and

2908
03:06:46,797 --> 03:06:48,011
the queen?

2909
03:06:48,011 --> 03:06:54,732
MATT: Yes. And as you return to the keep, Pike has
been taking care of the rest of the individuals,

2910
03:06:54,732 --> 03:07:01,696
and she's been seeing to Gilmore's side. Gilmore
is fast asleep, dealing with the tail end of a

2911
03:07:01,696 --> 03:07:09,281
fever that has broken, after the healing from the
day before. Earlier in the day, I should say. It

2912
03:07:09,281 --> 03:07:13,953
also appears that Salda and the children have been
in and out, keeping an eye as well. Pike, as you

2913
03:07:13,953 --> 03:07:18,813
enter, looks up to you with a smile, and says,
"He'll be all right. He's going to pull through."

2914
03:07:18,813 --> 03:07:20,473
LAURA: That's wonderful.

2915
03:07:20,473 --> 03:07:24,098
MATT: "I should probably stay with him for a bit.
Make sure he's okay."

2916
03:07:24,098 --> 03:07:26,117
LIAM: Is he unconscious still, or just sleeping?

2917
03:07:26,117 --> 03:07:31,938
MATT: He is asleep, currently, yeah. "He's been
conscious throughout the day while you were gone,

2918
03:07:31,938 --> 03:07:37,447
"but he's got to rest a bit more. He's still had a
rough few days."

2919
03:07:37,447 --> 03:07:41,051
TRAVIS: It's dead on.

2920
03:07:41,051 --> 03:07:46,098
TALIESIN: Just needs headphones.

2921
03:07:46,098 --> 03:07:50,266
MATT: I just need headphones, and to brush against
the mic occasionally. Especially during really

2922
03:07:50,266 --> 03:07:51,542
really impactful story moments.

2923
03:07:51,542 --> 03:07:52,927
LIAM: "What? What?"

2924
03:07:52,927 --> 03:07:58,564
MATT: So you guys find yourselves resting for the
evening. You take to a night's sleep.

2925
03:07:58,564 --> 03:08:00,328
LAURA: You going to sleep, Grog?

2926
03:08:00,328 --> 03:08:04,502
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2927
03:08:04,502 --> 03:08:05,946
MATT: Yeah, you got to sleep.

2928
03:08:05,946 --> 03:08:07,321
TRAVIS: I got to sleep.

2929
03:08:07,321 --> 03:08:10,503
MATT: If you don't sleep you're going to start
getting levels of exhaustion for the next day.

2930
03:08:10,503 --> 03:08:13,159
TRAVIS: Oh. Okay.

2931
03:08:13,159 --> 03:08:17,365
MATT: All right. So you lose the strength bonus.
Everyone, you can get half of your hit dice back.

2932
03:08:17,365 --> 03:08:18,863
TRAVIS: That's a lot of--

2933
03:08:18,863 --> 03:08:26,500
LIAM: As the sun goes down? It's been down and
everyone's going to their rooms? I go to Keyleth's

2934
03:08:26,500 --> 03:08:29,752
door and knock on it.

2935
03:08:29,752 --> 03:08:32,310
MATT: Keyleth.

2936
03:08:32,310 --> 03:08:37,404
MARISHA: I open the door. Hi.

2937
03:08:37,404 --> 03:08:48,166
LIAM: Hi. I don't want to be alone tonight. Do
you?

2938
03:08:48,166 --> 03:08:57,147
MARISHA: I haven't been wanting to be alone most
nights. And I let him in.

2939
03:08:57,147 --> 03:09:05,116
MATT: Okay. So, we--

2940
03:09:05,116 --> 03:09:08,337
LAURA: Bow-chicka-wow-wow!

2941
03:09:08,337 --> 03:09:09,861
MATT: Jump forward to the next morning--

2942
03:09:09,861 --> 03:09:11,722
TALIESIN: That wasn't the kind of ship I was
hoping to get.

2943
03:09:11,722 --> 03:09:13,949
(laughter)

2944
03:09:13,949 --> 03:09:15,780
TALIESIN: I don't think we can all fit on that
ship.

2945
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:23,195
MATT: So, next morning, you all wake up; full hit
points, get back half of your max hit dice that

2946
03:09:23,195 --> 03:09:29,730
you spent. All your spells back.

2947
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:35,762
LAURA: I give Scanlan the Hat of Disguise back.

2948
03:09:35,762 --> 03:09:36,913
MATT: Okay.

2949
03:09:36,913 --> 03:09:38,261
SAM: You sure you don't need it?

2950
03:09:38,261 --> 03:09:39,433
LAURA: Yeah, fuck 'em.

2951
03:09:39,433 --> 03:09:45,462
SAM: All right. Keep up those rhymes. Not bad for
a first timer.

2952
03:09:45,462 --> 03:09:47,078
(laughter)

2953
03:09:47,078 --> 03:09:52,051
MATT: All right, so. What's the plan?

2954
03:09:52,051 --> 03:09:54,931
SAM: You know, Vex, I don't want to be alone right
now.

2955
03:09:54,931 --> 03:09:57,667
(laughter)

2956
03:09:57,667 --> 03:10:00,937
LAURA: I take his face and I push him down on the
ground.

2957
03:10:00,937 --> 03:10:06,709
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

2958
03:10:06,709 --> 03:10:09,967
MARISHA: I don't know.

2959
03:10:09,967 --> 03:10:11,611
LAURA: Do we have a plan?

2960
03:10:11,611 --> 03:10:14,932
TALIESIN: I suppose our plan is the Slayer's Take
next?

2961
03:10:14,932 --> 03:10:16,375
TRAVIS: Yeah, Vasselheim.

2962
03:10:16,375 --> 03:10:18,986
SAM: How do we get there? Wait, we have to get rid
of all the 'fugees.

2963
03:10:18,986 --> 03:10:23,047
LAURA: Yeah. We need to go to Whitestone, then.

2964
03:10:23,047 --> 03:10:26,586
TALIESIN: Well, here's the question is do we want
to head towards Vasselheim from Whitestone?

2965
03:10:26,586 --> 03:10:27,997
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

2966
03:10:27,997 --> 03:10:32,916
TALIESIN: So we'll all go. We'll take the last of
the-- I can't believe I'm going to say this-- the

2967
03:10:32,916 --> 03:10:34,220
last of the 'fugees.

2968
03:10:34,220 --> 03:10:36,197
SAM: Yes. Ooh, la la la.

2969
03:10:36,197 --> 03:10:41,552
LAURA: Wait. All of our guards, and our servants,
as well. I don't want to leave everyone here.

2970
03:10:41,552 --> 03:10:43,322
SAM: We're abandoning the keep?

2971
03:10:43,322 --> 03:10:46,930
LAURA: I don't know what else to do. If dragons
attack, our five guards aren't going to be able to

2972
03:10:46,930 --> 03:10:48,145
do anything.

2973
03:10:48,145 --> 03:10:50,909
LIAM: One dragon crashed in the roof of the
building.

2974
03:10:50,909 --> 03:10:52,457
TALIESIN: Accidentally smushed.

2975
03:10:52,457 --> 03:10:55,777
LIAM: What are the cook and the maid going to do?

2976
03:10:55,777 --> 03:10:57,321
TALIESIN: Make it breakfast.

2977
03:10:57,321 --> 03:11:00,664
LIAM: Jarett's pretty badass, but I don't think he
can handle that.

2978
03:11:00,664 --> 03:11:01,962
TRAVIS: Dragons get hungry.

2979
03:11:01,962 --> 03:11:05,314
SAM: When we come back, our keep will be gone.

2980
03:11:05,314 --> 03:11:07,052
TALIESIN: And we'll be able to build it back up.

2981
03:11:07,052 --> 03:11:09,996
MARISHA: It'll match the rest of the city,
Scanlan.

2982
03:11:09,996 --> 03:11:13,475
LIAM: Percival's the lord of Whitestone. He's got
a castle!

2983
03:11:13,475 --> 03:11:14,727
LAURA: We find a new keep.

2984
03:11:14,727 --> 03:11:17,519
SAM: But my room is just the way I want it.

2985
03:11:17,519 --> 03:11:22,912
TALIESIN: I'm sure that some lucky dragon's going
to come and shit in your bed. It'll be fine.

2986
03:11:22,912 --> 03:11:27,386
SAM: All right, if we're going to leave the keep,
I'll need a moment in my room.

2987
03:11:27,386 --> 03:11:30,510
LIAM: You'll find another room bathed in 
self-loathing.

2988
03:11:30,510 --> 03:11:32,437
(laughter)

2989
03:11:32,437 --> 03:11:34,051
LIAM: It doesn't need to be here.

2990
03:11:34,051 --> 03:11:35,955
TALIESIN: It takes a good month to bathe a room in
that much self-loathing.

2991
03:11:35,955 --> 03:11:38,303
SAM: You look like you're glowing this morning.

2992
03:11:38,303 --> 03:11:39,547
LIAM: That's ridiculous.

2993
03:11:39,547 --> 03:11:42,597
SAM: I've never seen you quite so chipper.

2994
03:11:42,597 --> 03:11:52,411
TALIESIN: Let's gather what we need, make sure
that Gilmore is ready to move, as well. We'll

2995
03:11:52,411 --> 03:11:54,394
bring everybody through to Whitestone.

2996
03:11:54,394 --> 03:11:55,523
SAM: All right.

2997
03:11:55,523 --> 03:11:56,764
MATT: All right.

2998
03:11:56,764 --> 03:12:04,513
LAURA: I guess we should go tell the guards that
they probably will have to leave, if they want.

2999
03:12:04,513 --> 03:12:06,722
TALIESIN: And that they can come work in
Whitestone.

3000
03:12:06,722 --> 03:12:09,567
LAURA: Well, I don't want to force them to, but of
course they're welcome to.

3001
03:12:09,567 --> 03:12:12,820
LIAM: Why don't you go ask the guards? I'll go
talk to the kitchen staff.

3002
03:12:12,820 --> 03:12:14,200
LAURA: All right.

3003
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:16,654
TRAVIS: I know who she's going to talk to.

3004
03:12:16,654 --> 03:12:20,345
LAURA: He's the captain of the guards, anyway.

3005
03:12:20,345 --> 03:12:24,906
MATT: We'll say for the sake of brevity, you speak
with the rest of the keep's staff, including the

3006
03:12:24,906 --> 03:12:30,522
guards as well. Jarett for the most part is like,
"As long as I'm still getting paid, we're more

3007
03:12:30,522 --> 03:12:35,527
"than happy to go where you need us to be. If it's
further away from dragons, I am okay with that."

3008
03:12:35,527 --> 03:12:39,011
SAM: Don't you need your tools?

3009
03:12:39,011 --> 03:12:45,351
TALIESIN: I can pack up my kit, and I've also
technically got a reasonable workshop back in

3010
03:12:45,351 --> 03:12:46,368
Whitestone.

3011
03:12:46,368 --> 03:12:52,036
MATT: Okay, so you gather your materials, you
prepare at the tree in the center of the keep, you

3012
03:12:52,036 --> 03:12:53,251
say your goodbyes--

3013
03:12:53,251 --> 03:12:58,333
SAM: Before we go out there, I go to my room, I
take a dump on my bed--

3014
03:12:58,333 --> 03:13:00,687
MATT: You've used it at the temple of Sarenrae--

3015
03:13:00,687 --> 03:13:03,306
SAM: No, it's not a potion. Just a straight-up
poo.

3016
03:13:03,306 --> 03:13:07,364
MATT: Just a straight-up poo? Okay. Marking your
territory. I respect that.

3017
03:13:07,364 --> 03:13:11,341
SAM: I hang a note on the gate of the keep.

3018
03:13:11,341 --> 03:13:13,010
TRAVIS: Shitting on your own bed?

3019
03:13:13,010 --> 03:13:23,973
SAM: I don't want anyone else to use it. And with
a butter knife, I put a note on the gate to the

3020
03:13:23,973 --> 03:13:34,379
keep that says, "If Kaylie comes, go to
Whitestone. P.S. If my painting is delivered,

3021
03:13:34,379 --> 03:13:37,509
"please forward to Scanlan Shorthalt, care of
Whitestone."

3022
03:13:37,509 --> 03:13:41,677
MATT: All righty.

3023
03:13:41,677 --> 03:13:43,218
TRAVIS: "Mind the poo."

3024
03:13:43,218 --> 03:13:50,807
LAURA: I leave a note for Allura, and tell her
we've headed to Whitestone, as well.

3025
03:13:50,807 --> 03:13:52,202
MATT: Okay.

3026
03:13:52,202 --> 03:13:57,201
LAURA: I don't say Whitestone. I say, "the place
where we sent you originally,"

3027
03:13:57,201 --> 03:13:59,138
so she knows where it is.

3028
03:13:59,138 --> 03:14:03,361
MATT: Okay. Notes are placed. Spell is prepared?

3029
03:14:03,361 --> 03:14:07,004
TALIESIN: I've packed everything that could
possibly be used to make anything dangerous.

3030
03:14:07,004 --> 03:14:13,094
MATT: Okay. You have your supplies at the ready.
You all gather in the center of the temple of

3031
03:14:13,094 --> 03:14:15,572
Sarenrae. Keyleth?

3032
03:14:15,572 --> 03:14:18,127
LAURA: Not yet, Keyleth!

3033
03:14:18,127 --> 03:14:19,620
TALIESIN: We'll be back.

3034
03:14:19,620 --> 03:14:23,226
MARISHA: What's wrong? Are you ready, Vex?

3035
03:14:23,226 --> 03:14:29,997
LAURA: I mean, it's the first time we've had a
home in forever, and we're leaving it.

3036
03:14:29,997 --> 03:14:34,298
SAM: Can you make it disappear, or something?

3037
03:14:34,298 --> 03:14:37,650
LAURA: We can go. It's nothing.

3038
03:14:37,650 --> 03:14:41,825
MARISHA: I can put Hallucinatory Terrain over it,
that'll last a bit, but not

3039
03:14:41,825 --> 03:14:43,078
long enough to make it worthwhile.

3040
03:14:43,078 --> 03:14:44,328
LAURA: It's just stone.

3041
03:14:44,328 --> 03:14:46,131
LIAM: We've done it once before. We can do it
again.

3042
03:14:46,131 --> 03:14:53,163
TALIESIN: It will be built back better than
before. That's what we do.

3043
03:14:53,163 --> 03:14:55,478
LAURA: Let's go.

3044
03:14:55,478 --> 03:15:05,128
MATT: The portal opens outside of the tree, and
all of the refugees start rushing through. You

3045
03:15:05,128 --> 03:15:09,687
guys give chase, following over to the opposite
side, where Whitestone waits. You all emerge from

3046
03:15:09,687 --> 03:15:11,762
the Sun Tree in the center of the familiar town.

3047
03:15:11,762 --> 03:15:13,773
LIAM: Fucking cold!

3048
03:15:13,773 --> 03:15:18,655
MATT: It is chilly. Not as snow-dappled as it was
when you first arrived. A little has melted, and

3049
03:15:18,655 --> 03:15:22,948
the clouds are a little bit more open; you can see
some of the blue sky above you. It's actually a

3050
03:15:22,948 --> 03:15:28,701
beautiful day, if a bit chilly. As you emerge, you
can see there's a few individuals in the center of

3051
03:15:28,701 --> 03:15:31,958
the town, including a couple of the original
refugees that seem to be waiting for the rest to

3052
03:15:31,958 --> 03:15:35,537
come through. They greet you as soon as you
arrive, and rush up and grab a couple of people

3053
03:15:35,537 --> 03:15:38,915
that they had met at your keep. Some come forward
and say, "Thank you. I'm so glad you made it!"

3054
03:15:38,915 --> 03:15:40,579
They shake your hands.

3055
03:15:40,579 --> 03:15:50,468
You've arrived back in Whitestone. So, do you guys
want to wait here for the day, and then make your

3056
03:15:50,468 --> 03:15:52,171
way to Vasselheim?

3057
03:15:52,171 --> 03:15:54,268
SAM: Do we need to talk to anybody here?

3058
03:15:54,268 --> 03:15:58,759
TALIESIN: Just to set up to make sure that the
queen and her children

3059
03:15:58,759 --> 03:16:00,582
are taken in at the castle.

3060
03:16:00,582 --> 03:16:03,793
LIAM: I imagine you'll fill your sister in.

3061
03:16:03,793 --> 03:16:08,183
TALIESIN: I will. I'll fill my sister in on how
they're to be taken care of. Make sure that

3062
03:16:08,183 --> 03:16:09,974
Gilmore is taken care of.

3063
03:16:09,974 --> 03:16:13,079
SAM: We may want to stock up on potions and stuff
before we leave.

3064
03:16:13,079 --> 03:16:14,738
LAURA: Yeah, buy as much as we can.

3065
03:16:14,738 --> 03:16:15,986
TALIESIN: There's a shop.

3066
03:16:15,986 --> 03:16:17,838
MATT: There is, but you guys have cleaned it out.

3067
03:16:17,838 --> 03:16:20,268
LAURA: Buy stuff in Vasselheim.

3068
03:16:20,268 --> 03:16:24,688
MATT: They have not had an opportunity to restock.
Their main providers have been killed.

3069
03:16:24,688 --> 03:16:30,645
LIAM: Do you think that with the time that's
passed, Cassandra has found any of the belongings

3070
03:16:30,645 --> 03:16:34,246
of the Briarwoods? They were pretty snazzy.

3071
03:16:34,246 --> 03:16:35,884
TALIESIN: We can ask about that.

3072
03:16:35,884 --> 03:16:40,035
MATT: You approach Cassandra, who is happy to
greet you once you return.

3073
03:16:40,035 --> 03:16:43,277
"Did you have a question?"

3074
03:16:43,277 --> 03:16:45,421
TALIESIN: Vax?

3075
03:16:45,421 --> 03:16:55,917
LIAM: We need to kill some dragons, and we are out
of everything. You've been here a while. Have you

3076
03:16:55,917 --> 03:17:02,655
found anything of the Briarwoods? Any store of
treasure or potion or anything of use?

3077
03:17:02,655 --> 03:17:10,650
MATT: "Well, the personal effects you all
retrieved when they were defeated. What remnants

3078
03:17:10,650 --> 03:17:16,520
"of income or gold which they'd kept was put in
with the rest of the Whitestone treasury when they

3079
03:17:16,520 --> 03:17:17,639
"took over."

3080
03:17:17,639 --> 03:17:23,326
LIAM: Not so much interested in gold as in means
of protection or healing.

3081
03:17:23,326 --> 03:17:28,267
MATT: "They weren't really specialized in healing,
I'm afraid, and what bits of protection they had,

3082
03:17:28,267 --> 03:17:32,182
"you've already taken. But if gold is what you
need, we can probably spare you some."

3083
03:17:32,182 --> 03:17:38,111
LAURA: I mean, I'm not going to say no to the
gold.

3084
03:17:38,111 --> 03:17:42,525
TALIESIN: Obviously, we'll sieve the coffer a
little bit because we're going to

3085
03:17:42,525 --> 03:17:43,925
need it for the mission.

3086
03:17:43,925 --> 03:17:45,265
LAURA: So very generous of you.

3087
03:17:45,265 --> 03:17:54,656
TALIESIN: Also, let's re-employ our castle guards
as the Emon royal guards in the meantime, and they

3088
03:17:54,656 --> 03:17:57,020
can serve the queen and her children.

3089
03:17:57,020 --> 03:17:58,259
LAURA: I like it.

3090
03:17:58,259 --> 03:18:06,074
MATT: "That can be very easily presented. Oh, here
we are!" There's a small chest with a lid that she

3091
03:18:06,074 --> 03:18:11,953
hands it over to you. Actually, puts it out and
your hands are already out. "All right. 2,000 gold

3092
03:18:11,953 --> 03:18:14,917
"from our coffers. It's not much, but we have to
keep the city running."

3093
03:18:14,917 --> 03:18:15,908
LAURA: Of course.

3094
03:18:15,908 --> 03:18:19,258
TALIESIN: And a small amount of the green gem, if
that would be possible, that's left over from the

3095
03:18:19,258 --> 03:18:20,881
mining operation.

3096
03:18:20,881 --> 03:18:22,348
MATT: "Of the glass?"

3097
03:18:22,348 --> 03:18:23,794
TALIESIN: Of the glass. If possible.

3098
03:18:23,794 --> 03:18:25,055
MATT: "Yes, certainly."

3099
03:18:25,055 --> 03:18:26,662
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm working on something.

3100
03:18:26,662 --> 03:18:31,119
MATT: "Very well." It takes a few minutes for that
to be retrieved from down south of the tomb in the

3101
03:18:31,119 --> 03:18:40,168
mausoleum, but nevertheless, you get four
half-dollar-sized pieces of residuum glass.

3102
03:18:40,168 --> 03:18:41,578
TALIESIN: Perfect.

3103
03:18:41,578 --> 03:18:52,452
MATT: Four shards of residuum glass. "I hope
that's of aid to you. Apology for the confusion.

3104
03:18:52,452 --> 03:18:56,158
"We have quite a bit of individuals to find homes
for, and get them running."

3105
03:18:56,158 --> 03:18:58,068
TALIESIN: Gilmore will be of great help.

3106
03:18:58,068 --> 03:19:00,222
MATT: "Yes, as you've told me."

3107
03:19:00,222 --> 03:19:06,053
TALIESIN: (laughs) I'm sorry to drop this all on
you, and I'm thankful.

3108
03:19:06,053 --> 03:19:10,579
MATT: "I'm thankful that we even have an
opportunity to offer aid to somebody. That's

3109
03:19:10,579 --> 03:19:12,724
"thanks to you, so it's nothing on us."

3110
03:19:12,724 --> 03:19:15,379
TALIESIN: It will not be the end of it, sadly.

3111
03:19:15,379 --> 03:19:19,789
MATT: "That's all right. Whatever we can do.
Anyway, good luck."

3112
03:19:19,789 --> 03:19:21,227
TALIESIN: I'll be off in the morning.

3113
03:19:21,227 --> 03:19:22,666
SAM: How are we getting to Vasselheim?

3114
03:19:22,666 --> 03:19:26,322
TALIESIN: We can teleport.

3115
03:19:26,322 --> 03:19:27,584
LAURA: Yeah, teleport, right?

3116
03:19:27,584 --> 03:19:28,864
SAM: Is that true?

3117
03:19:28,864 --> 03:19:31,701
LAURA: Just pop on over, yeah. We sleep for the
night, and then we go over to

3118
03:19:31,701 --> 03:19:32,958
Vasselheim the next day.

3119
03:19:32,958 --> 03:19:34,255
LIAM: Let's have dinner.

3120
03:19:34,255 --> 03:19:35,827
LAURA: Hang out in Whitestone for the day.

3121
03:19:35,827 --> 03:19:37,144
TALIESIN: I'm going to work on that little
project.

3122
03:19:37,144 --> 03:19:38,874
LIAM: Whitestone and chill.

3123
03:19:38,874 --> 03:19:49,128
TALIESIN: The thing I was trying to attach to my
gun but wasn't working, I'm going to try to attach

3124
03:19:49,128 --> 03:19:50,759
it to my boot instead.

3125
03:19:50,759 --> 03:19:53,219
MATT: Interesting.

3126
03:19:53,219 --> 03:19:56,684
TALIESIN: I can draw you a sketch.

3127
03:19:56,684 --> 03:20:00,704
MATT: All right. While the rest of you guys are attempting
to rest, I need you to make a tinker tools check.

3128
03:20:00,788 --> 03:20:05,521
LIAM: Tinker tools. This goes in here.

3129
03:20:05,521 --> 03:20:09,110
TALIESIN: That's better. 22.

3130
03:20:09,110 --> 03:20:14,150
MATT: 22. You've affixed it to your boot. We'll
see if it works.

3131
03:20:14,150 --> 03:20:18,816
TALIESIN: And I've got one working piece? I know
each individual build, I have to build the--

3132
03:20:18,816 --> 03:20:22,294
SAM: The nubbin.

3133
03:20:22,294 --> 03:20:28,657
TALIESIN: The actual device itself has to be built
for individual usage; it's not auto. I'm going to

3134
03:20:28,657 --> 03:20:30,593
try and build one and see how it goes.

3135
03:20:30,593 --> 03:20:35,656
MATT: Okay. So total cost for the materials on
that will put you at about 300 gold.

3136
03:20:35,656 --> 03:20:37,979
LAURA: What?

3137
03:20:37,979 --> 03:20:39,316
SAM: 300 gold.

3138
03:20:39,316 --> 03:20:40,716
TALIESIN: I'm working on something.

3139
03:20:40,716 --> 03:20:41,765
LAURA: Okay.

3140
03:20:41,765 --> 03:20:42,781
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3141
03:20:42,781 --> 03:20:43,824
LAURA: I mean, it's your city.

3142
03:20:43,824 --> 03:20:47,215
LIAM: Are you borrowing 300 of your gold from the
money you loaned to Vex?

3143
03:20:47,215 --> 03:20:53,928
TALIESIN: Since the day I've met her, I've given
her every bloody dime I've made. So, yes. I no

3144
03:20:53,928 --> 03:20:55,571
longer even think about it anymore.

3145
03:20:55,571 --> 03:20:56,665
LAURA: And I love you for it.

3146
03:20:56,665 --> 03:21:00,988
TALIESIN: She's practically the royal treasurer.
She's just happier that way.

3147
03:21:00,988 --> 03:21:03,148
MARISHA: (laughing) "She's just happier that
way."

3148
03:21:03,148 --> 03:21:07,582
MATT: All right. You find an evening's rest. The
next morning comes uneventfully. You find

3149
03:21:07,582 --> 03:21:10,869
yourselves refreshed. I'd say at this point,
you're all at full hit dice after two nights of

3150
03:21:10,869 --> 03:21:16,911
rest; you're fine. So, on to Whitestone, Keyleth?

3151
03:21:16,911 --> 03:21:18,864
LAURA and TRAVIS: Vasselheim?

3152
03:21:18,864 --> 03:21:20,437
MATT: Sorry. You're in Whitestone.

3153
03:21:20,437 --> 03:21:21,614
LIAM: We were just here!

3154
03:21:21,614 --> 03:21:26,817
MATT: You recall you've seen a number of trees.
The largest you've seen in Vasselheim would

3155
03:21:26,817 --> 03:21:29,332
probably have been on the outskirts of--

3156
03:21:29,332 --> 03:21:30,978
LIAM: Where we fought the hydra, maybe.

3157
03:21:30,978 --> 03:21:33,924
MARISHA: We camped out in a few trees outside of
Vasselheim.

3158
03:21:33,924 --> 03:21:36,935
MATT: Do you want to stop outside the city or
within the city, is the question.

3159
03:21:36,935 --> 03:21:38,188
MARISHA: Whatever's closest.

3160
03:21:38,188 --> 03:21:39,653
TRAVIS: No. No magic in the city.

3161
03:21:39,653 --> 03:21:40,950
LAURA: No magic in the city, remember?

3162
03:21:40,950 --> 03:21:47,387
MATT: No arcane magic. Divine magic is a different
thing. There's plenty of

3163
03:21:47,387 --> 03:21:49,084
divine magic within the city.

3164
03:21:49,084 --> 03:21:52,063
LAURA: Oh, is there a teleportation circle? Do we
have one in Whitestone?

3165
03:21:52,063 --> 03:21:54,649
MARISHA: There wasn't a teleportation circle to
Vasselheim.

3166
03:21:54,649 --> 03:21:59,585
MATT: There are no sigils to Vasselheim. Part of
their defense process is preventing any secret

3167
03:21:59,585 --> 03:22:02,661
intrusion in that regard.

3168
03:22:02,661 --> 03:22:09,531
TALIESIN: We'll teleport to the outside of the
city and perhaps sleep at the temple of Sarenrae.

3169
03:22:09,531 --> 03:22:10,871
MATT: There's the Abundant Terrace.

3170
03:22:10,871 --> 03:22:12,588
LAURA: We always have rooms at Slayer's Take,
remember.

3171
03:22:12,588 --> 03:22:14,445
TALIESIN: We do always have rooms at Slayer's
Take.

3172
03:22:14,445 --> 03:22:15,789
MARISHA: What's the Abundant Terrace?

3173
03:22:15,789 --> 03:22:23,151
MATT: That's the section that Melora looks over.
That is where primarily most of the farming, food--

3174
03:22:23,151 --> 03:22:24,873
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go there.

3175
03:22:24,873 --> 03:22:27,703
MATT: That's where you know there are a number of
orchards and things that are kept in that

3176
03:22:27,703 --> 03:22:29,640
vicinity. If you wanted to.

3177
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:31,819
MARISHA: That's right outside the city?

3178
03:22:31,819 --> 03:22:35,798
MATT: It's within the city. It's one of the five
quarters. I won't say quarters. It's one of the

3179
03:22:35,798 --> 03:22:36,763
five areas.

3180
03:22:36,763 --> 03:22:37,808
MARISHA: Sure.

3181
03:22:37,808 --> 03:22:38,823
MATT: Quarters.

3182
03:22:38,823 --> 03:22:44,642
LAURA: Is Gilmore staying here in Whitestone?
Yes?

3183
03:22:44,642 --> 03:22:46,740
MATT: Yeah, unless you want to try and bring him
with you.

3184
03:22:46,740 --> 03:22:50,171
LAURA: No, it makes sense to leave him here,
right? Where do you want to stay, Gilmore?

3185
03:22:50,171 --> 03:22:57,311
MATT: (laughs) You're approaching Gilmore. He
goes, "To be perfectly honest, I'm not quite

3186
03:22:57,311 --> 03:23:05,230
"feeling 100%, and let's just say I'm not a huge
fan of the zealot type."

3187
03:23:05,230 --> 03:23:06,576
LAURA: Understandable.

3188
03:23:06,576 --> 03:23:11,899
MATT: "Vasselheim doesn't really jangle my
dingles."

3189
03:23:11,899 --> 03:23:15,686
LAURA: You've got a whole bookstore devoted to you
here.

3190
03:23:15,686 --> 03:23:17,496
MATT: "This is true."

3191
03:23:17,496 --> 03:23:22,404
TALIESIN: I would appreciate your help in restarting
the economy of Whitestone, to be fair.

3192
03:23:22,404 --> 03:23:28,614
MATT: "Well. (sighs) Guess it's not too late to
open a new branch of Gilmore's Glorious Goods,

3193
03:23:28,614 --> 03:23:39,392
"since my other, possibly, two no longer exist.
(sighs) I was so close to opening. I started from

3194
03:23:39,392 --> 03:23:43,543
"nothing! I can do it again. (coughs) Good luck,
you all."

3195
03:23:43,543 --> 03:23:44,995
TALIESIN: You as well.

3196
03:23:44,995 --> 03:23:48,012
SAM: So we're going to a tree outside of the
city?

3197
03:23:48,012 --> 03:23:49,041
TRAVIS: Yep.

3198
03:23:49,041 --> 03:23:51,100
MARISHA: Well, it's in the farming district in the
city.

3199
03:23:51,100 --> 03:23:52,427
MATT: It's in the actual city.

3200
03:23:52,427 --> 03:23:53,746
LAURA: All right, cool.

3201
03:23:53,746 --> 03:23:59,070
MATT: All right. Using this once again off the Sun
Tree, you guys step through. As you emerge out the

3202
03:23:59,070 --> 03:24:07,802
other side, you are in the thick of a heavy
orchard in the Abundant Terrace. There is heavy

3203
03:24:07,802 --> 03:24:12,146
snowfall that has fallen recently here, and where
it was cold in Whitestone, it's <i>cold</i> here in

3204
03:24:12,146 --> 03:24:20,129
Vasselheim. You can see built-up ice and sleet
that has recently been pushed off to the sides of

3205
03:24:20,129 --> 03:24:27,657
the orchard. Even amongst this very cold weather,
all of the plant life in this area is vibrant and

3206
03:24:27,657 --> 03:24:29,441
springtime green.

3207
03:24:29,441 --> 03:24:34,956
As you all emerge in the center of this orchard,
you can see one of the nearby workers who's

3208
03:24:34,956 --> 03:24:39,371
tilling the land looks over. "Hey! What are you
doing here? You're not supposed to be in the

3209
03:24:39,371 --> 03:24:41,003
"middle of the orchard!"

3210
03:24:41,003 --> 03:24:43,906
LAURA: Slayer's Take business. We'll keep moving.

3211
03:24:43,906 --> 03:24:45,126
TALIESIN: We were just leaving.

3212
03:24:45,126 --> 03:24:50,065
MATT: (groans) "Fucking Slayer's Take. Do whatever
the fuck they want." He drinks out of his canteen.

3213
03:24:50,065 --> 03:24:51,491
"Fine! Just get out."

3214
03:24:51,491 --> 03:24:56,536
LIAM: Glad that manticore's not in your orchard.
That's all I can say.

3215
03:24:56,536 --> 03:24:57,766
MATT: "Manticore?"

3216
03:24:57,766 --> 03:25:00,040
TALIESIN: That's just cruel.

3217
03:25:00,040 --> 03:25:01,526
LAURA: Don't worry. We took care of it.

3218
03:25:01,526 --> 03:25:06,542
MATT: (weakly) "Thanks." He starts looking
nervously over his shoulders as he goes back to

3219
03:25:06,542 --> 03:25:11,539
his work. Eventually, you guys step outside of the
Terrace, finding your way to the Quadroads, which

3220
03:25:11,539 --> 03:25:18,904
is the central network that the four main portions
of Vasselheim attach to. This is the Erathis-based

3221
03:25:18,904 --> 03:25:24,518
center of the town. You have before you, to remind
you, at the very northern part of the town is the

3222
03:25:24,518 --> 03:25:30,706
extremely tall, pointed mountain known as Heaven's
Stair. Attached to that mountain on one side is

3223
03:25:30,706 --> 03:25:38,182
the Silver Talon's Reach. That is the main temple
to Bahamut. To the left of it, against the

3224
03:25:38,182 --> 03:25:46,415
mountain, not actually into it, is the Braving
Grounds. This is the area that is geared towards

3225
03:25:46,415 --> 03:25:53,653
Kord, the deity of war, where you had previously
had a conversation with the Dawn Master, the

3226
03:25:53,653 --> 03:26:00,511
Earthbreaker Groon. There's the Platinum Sanctuary
in the Silver Talon's Reach, which is where the

3227
03:26:00,511 --> 03:26:07,751
Highbearer Vord, the Silver-Touched, the high
priest of Bahamut is. You also just left the

3228
03:26:07,751 --> 03:26:15,513
Abundant Terrace, and there is the Quadroads,
which is where the Slayer's Take currently is. And

3229
03:26:15,513 --> 03:26:20,263
there is the Duskmeadow, which is the Raven
Queen's domain. Where do you guys want to go?

3230
03:26:20,263 --> 03:26:24,663
LIAM: Remind me, what was the Duskmeadow, again? Was
that where we chased the rakshasa?

3231
03:26:24,663 --> 03:26:28,216
MATT: That is where the Amaranthine Oubliette
resides, which is the prison of the city.

3232
03:26:28,216 --> 03:26:35,269
MARISHA: What was the name of the section of the
city that has the Slayer's Take?

3233
03:26:35,269 --> 03:26:40,543
MATT: That's the Quadroads, the Erathis, deity of
civilization.

3234
03:26:40,543 --> 03:26:50,488
TRAVIS: So, like, I really want to go talk to the
Kung Fu Panda master. I don't think we're going to

3235
03:26:50,488 --> 03:26:55,459
get a lot of fights in. The guy, I think he was
the teacher of Kern.

3236
03:26:55,459 --> 03:26:58,560
The guy I beat in the crucible.

3237
03:26:58,560 --> 03:27:00,719
LIAM: That ripped, chiseled old man?

3238
03:27:00,719 --> 03:27:01,664
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3239
03:27:01,664 --> 03:27:03,540
SAM: The guy who beat you twice?

3240
03:27:03,540 --> 03:27:05,024
LIAM, LAURA, AND TRAVIS: No.

3241
03:27:05,024 --> 03:27:10,768
TRAVIS: And nobody beat me twice. He got lucky
once, get it straight. I want to go talk to him

3242
03:27:10,768 --> 03:27:15,150
because maybe we need some more fighters and
strong folks and I think he might know where they

3243
03:27:15,150 --> 03:27:16,184
might be.

3244
03:27:16,184 --> 03:27:17,793
SAM: We should talk to the Slayer's Take, as
well.

3245
03:27:17,793 --> 03:27:19,370
TALIESIN: We should get our rooms.

3246
03:27:19,370 --> 03:27:21,931
LAURA: Yeah, let's go post up.

3247
03:27:21,931 --> 03:27:23,264
TALIESIN: We have things to put down.

3248
03:27:23,264 --> 03:27:28,608
MARISHA: And also only about a day's travel from
Pyrah.

3249
03:27:28,608 --> 03:27:29,828
SAM: What's that? Pyrah?

3250
03:27:29,828 --> 03:27:31,175
LAURA: Her home.

3251
03:27:31,175 --> 03:27:32,139
SAM: Oh.

3252
03:27:32,139 --> 03:27:39,498
TALIESIN: What's left of it. That will be a trip
that will be necessary soon, but not yet.

3253
03:27:39,498 --> 03:27:43,649
MATT: You guys hit the Slayer's Take first, or
where are you heading?

3254
03:27:43,649 --> 03:27:44,977
LAURA and TRAVIS: Slayer's Take.

3255
03:27:44,977 --> 03:27:47,117
LAURA: Just to let them know we're here and we
need some rooms.

3256
03:27:47,117 --> 03:27:53,768
MATT: Okay. You make your way to the outside of
the main Slayer's Take guildhall. The dark wood

3257
03:27:53,768 --> 03:27:59,987
exterior greets you happily. You can see they
still have a gathering of various antlers of

3258
03:27:59,987 --> 03:28:05,692
creatures that are tangled into each other that
form this rustic-looking entrance. And there on

3259
03:28:05,692 --> 03:28:12,632
the front doors, you see emblazoned the Slayer's
Take-- for lack of a better term, their symbol

3260
03:28:12,632 --> 03:28:16,593
with the words of their actual guild spread across
it, as you saw before.

3261
03:28:16,593 --> 03:28:22,679
Opening the front door, you can see within the
main foyer area, there is the dark iron

3262
03:28:22,679 --> 03:28:38,732
chandeliers that run across the entire length of
the moot hall, if you will. Across the front area,

3263
03:28:38,732 --> 03:28:45,726
you find the clerk desk. Sitting behind it, a
familiar red-haired, tousled, chin-bearded,

3264
03:28:45,726 --> 03:28:51,518
scarred-up tiny man with his feet up on the desk,
falling asleep in his chair.

3265
03:28:51,518 --> 03:28:54,985
LAURA: (laughs) Oi!

3266
03:28:54,985 --> 03:28:58,791
LIAM: Ta-da!

3267
03:28:58,791 --> 03:29:05,387
MATT: "What is this craziness? (laughs) Ah! It's
been some time."

3268
03:29:05,387 --> 03:29:06,726
LAURA: It has.

3269
03:29:06,726 --> 03:29:10,094
MATT: "So. Hello."

3270
03:29:10,094 --> 03:29:11,189
LAURA: Hi.

3271
03:29:11,189 --> 03:29:12,991
MATT: "What's your business? What are you looking
for?"

3272
03:29:12,991 --> 03:29:19,521
LAURA: Dragons? Have you heard about anything?

3273
03:29:19,521 --> 03:29:29,725
MATT: "Other than the fact that you killed one.
That is the most recent, but nothing beyond that,

3274
03:29:29,725 --> 03:29:30,830
"really, no."

3275
03:29:30,830 --> 03:29:32,432
LAURA: We're going to need rooms.

3276
03:29:32,432 --> 03:29:35,864
LIAM: And we're probably going to need to speak to
your lady lord.

3277
03:29:35,864 --> 03:29:37,029
LAURA: Your wife.

3278
03:29:37,029 --> 03:29:39,845
LIAM: Well, your wife, but I'm talking about the
boss, here.

3279
03:29:39,845 --> 03:29:41,071
LAURA: That's his wife.

3280
03:29:41,071 --> 03:29:45,586
LIAM: Higher still: the sphinx.

3281
03:29:45,586 --> 03:29:47,191
LAURA: Oh.

3282
03:29:47,191 --> 03:29:57,525
MATT: "Vanessa, she's currently out on a hunt.
Should be back in the next day or so."

3283
03:29:57,525 --> 03:30:02,737
LIAM: We've urgent business to discuss with her.
For now, we need a place to stay.

3284
03:30:02,737 --> 03:30:07,838
MATT: "Well, you're always welcome here. This is
your home away from home, so please, take a load

3285
03:30:07,838 --> 03:30:10,821
"off. Pick a room. It's up to you. It's good to see
you all so healthy!"

3286
03:30:10,821 --> 03:30:12,008
LAURA: Healthy.

3287
03:30:12,008 --> 03:30:15,277
SAM: Thank you, Mertin. Right?

3288
03:30:15,277 --> 03:30:20,490
MATT: "Yes. So glad to hear."

3289
03:30:20,490 --> 03:30:23,585
LIAM: The only reason I remember that is it sounds
like merkin.

3290
03:30:23,585 --> 03:30:27,136
LAURA: Is Zahra around?

3291
03:30:27,136 --> 03:30:30,473
MATT: "She's actually currently out with Vanessa
on a hunt, as we speak."

3292
03:30:30,473 --> 03:30:32,687
LAURA: That's wonderful.

3293
03:30:32,687 --> 03:30:34,247
SAM: Perhaps we could see her.

3294
03:30:34,247 --> 03:30:39,645
LIAM: Sorry, we're tired. We've been hopping all
over.

3295
03:30:39,645 --> 03:30:41,916
MATT: "Me, too. I was sleeping when you came in. I
don't mind if I get back to that."

3296
03:30:41,916 --> 03:30:43,517
LIAM: Sorry. Any room?

3297
03:30:43,517 --> 03:30:50,065
MATT: "If it's somebody else's room, they'll let
you know, so please, take your time."

3298
03:30:50,065 --> 03:30:54,638
LAURA: Well, settle in?

3299
03:30:54,638 --> 03:30:55,894
TALIESIN: I'm settling in.

3300
03:30:55,894 --> 03:30:57,301
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess we all settle in.

3301
03:30:57,301 --> 03:31:02,502
MATT: There's a number of empty rooms. Doesn't
look like there's a lot of individuals around. As

3302
03:31:02,502 --> 03:31:06,003
you walk down one of the hallways, though, you do
see there is a card table, and the two individuals

3303
03:31:06,003 --> 03:31:12,317
in there, you see a very scarred, burly, and
frustrated dwarf who's throwing down cards on a

3304
03:31:12,317 --> 03:31:20,128
table. Black, long series of beards, and his hair
over his beard. You see Thorbir is sitting there

3305
03:31:20,128 --> 03:31:26,266
at the card table with another man wearing really
beautiful, ornate armor that is well-polished;

3306
03:31:26,266 --> 03:31:33,186
very short, dirty blond hair, who is apparently
owning him at cards, going, (chuckles) "You've

3307
03:31:33,186 --> 03:31:35,227
"terrible luck, friend. I'm sorry to hear this."

3308
03:31:35,227 --> 03:31:36,367
LAURA: (whispering) Aldor.

3309
03:31:36,367 --> 03:31:37,739
MATT: It's Aldor.

3310
03:31:37,739 --> 03:31:39,681
TALIESIN: Whoa!

3311
03:31:39,681 --> 03:31:46,024
MATT: Thorbir's sitting there, and throws his
cards on the table. (scoffs, sighs) "They tell me

3312
03:31:46,024 --> 03:31:48,102
"I'm supposed to have the luck of the dwarves."

3313
03:31:48,102 --> 03:31:51,026
(laughter)

3314
03:31:51,026 --> 03:31:58,381
MATT: "Oh. I guess it's about time you all showed
up. I'm going to get a drink." And he gets up,

3315
03:31:58,381 --> 03:32:02,972
away from the table, and walks away from the rest
of you, with a half-hearted "hi," but he's in a

3316
03:32:02,972 --> 03:32:08,126
huffy mood and walks off. Aldor takes his winnings
and scoops the change into a pouch.

3317
03:32:08,126 --> 03:32:13,511
LIAM: Aldor, Aldor, Aldor.

3318
03:32:13,511 --> 03:32:15,977
SAM: How's Lyra? Have you seen her?

3319
03:32:15,977 --> 03:32:19,542
(laughter)

3320
03:32:19,542 --> 03:32:21,743
MATT: "Why? Have you seen her?"

3321
03:32:21,743 --> 03:32:26,019
SAM: Not in a while, but we thought you guys were
engaged to be married. No?

3322
03:32:26,019 --> 03:32:27,337
TALIESIN: That's the last we heard.

3323
03:32:27,337 --> 03:32:30,911
MATT: He reaches forward and grabs your shirt and
pulls you in. "Where did you hear that?"

3324
03:32:30,911 --> 03:32:34,226
SAM: Not from a reliable source, I promise you.

3325
03:32:34,226 --> 03:32:35,379
TALIESIN: Very sketchy source.

3326
03:32:35,379 --> 03:32:38,199
MATT: "Good. You haven't seen her, have you?"

3327
03:32:38,199 --> 03:32:39,582
SAM: Not in a long time.

3328
03:32:39,582 --> 03:32:41,238
MATT: "Good."

3329
03:32:41,238 --> 03:32:43,831
LIAM: She's still a member of the Slayer's Take,
of course, though. Isn't she?

3330
03:32:43,831 --> 03:32:51,026
MATT: "I assume. I just run if I see her. She's a
bit--"

3331
03:32:51,026 --> 03:32:52,238
LAURA: Yeah.

3332
03:32:52,238 --> 03:32:54,182
SAM: No! She seems nice to me.

3333
03:32:54,182 --> 03:33:01,617
MATT: "Good. You know what, actually, if you want
to do me a favor. I mean, she's a nice girl,

3334
03:33:01,617 --> 03:33:09,761
"probably pretty easy if you ask her. Why don't you
take her off my hands and go on a date? Take her

3335
03:33:09,761 --> 03:33:11,780
"out for dinner. Distract her."

3336
03:33:11,780 --> 03:33:13,467
SAM: You saw her first. I'm a man of honor.

3337
03:33:13,467 --> 03:33:21,788
MATT: "Oh. No. I should go." He grabs his stuff
and leaves in a huff.

3338
03:33:21,788 --> 03:33:23,990
TRAVIS: Good to see him.

3339
03:33:23,990 --> 03:33:25,141
LAURA: Yeah.

3340
03:33:25,141 --> 03:33:26,510
TALIESIN: He's looking well.

3341
03:33:26,510 --> 03:33:28,960
SAM: True love.

3342
03:33:28,960 --> 03:33:32,490
MARISHA: It's weird being back, you guys.

3343
03:33:32,490 --> 03:33:38,514
SAM: Well, I guess we should ask them all if they
want to come with us to fight a dragon?

3344
03:33:38,514 --> 03:33:41,329
MARISHA: Yeah, do we do that now, or do we do that
in the morning?

3345
03:33:41,329 --> 03:33:43,313
TRAVIS AND TALIESIN: In the morning.

3346
03:33:43,313 --> 03:33:47,773
LIAM: It feels like we were just running screaming
from dragons in the sky.

3347
03:33:47,773 --> 03:33:52,690
MARISHA: Yeah. We traveled.

3348
03:33:52,690 --> 03:33:56,419
SAM: We'll sleep on it. We'll talk to Nessa in
the morning.

3349
03:33:56,419 --> 03:33:59,835
LIAM: We'll get up in the morning, we'll take some
of that gold, we'll put it to good use, we'll wait

3350
03:33:59,835 --> 03:34:03,300
until Nessa gets back, and then we'll carve out a
plan.

3351
03:34:03,300 --> 03:34:04,363
SAM: Okay.

3352
03:34:04,363 --> 03:34:05,412
LIAM: Percival?

3353
03:34:05,412 --> 03:34:06,605
TALIESIN: That sounds just fine.

3354
03:34:06,605 --> 03:34:07,849
SAM: Kord's strength to us all.

3355
03:34:07,849 --> 03:34:08,971
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3356
03:34:08,971 --> 03:34:10,769
LAURA: I wonder if Kashaw is still here.

3357
03:34:10,769 --> 03:34:12,994
LIAM: Probably, he works here.

3358
03:34:12,994 --> 03:34:13,944
MARISHA: Who?

3359
03:34:13,944 --> 03:34:19,012
SAM: Kashaw. That was the one that they went on
a--

3360
03:34:19,012 --> 03:34:21,231
LAURA: Oh! Right, Keyleth? The guy that kissed
you.

3361
03:34:21,231 --> 03:34:25,329
MARISHA: (stammers)

3362
03:34:25,329 --> 03:34:29,128
TALIESIN: Brooding. Handsome. He was so troubled.

3363
03:34:29,128 --> 03:34:30,227
LIAM: He was.

3364
03:34:30,227 --> 03:34:32,371
LAURA: He was very handsome.

3365
03:34:32,371 --> 03:34:36,131
MARISHA: So we should probably go to sleep, you
guys.

3366
03:34:36,131 --> 03:34:37,744
LAURA: It's morning, still.

3367
03:34:37,744 --> 03:34:41,516
MATT: Yeah, it's maybe 10:00am.

3368
03:34:41,516 --> 03:34:42,845
MARISHA: Take a nap?

3369
03:34:42,845 --> 03:34:44,789
MATT: It's across the world, so it's technically
earlier.

3370
03:34:44,789 --> 03:34:49,417
MARISHA: You know, it's jet lag. It's teleport
lag. It gets to you.

3371
03:34:49,417 --> 03:34:53,679
LAURA: Maybe Nessa and Zahra have seen him. We
could find out. We could use another healer, always.

3372
03:34:53,679 --> 03:35:03,093
MATT: It would be 10:00, 10:30 in Whitestone.
About 6:30, 7:00 in the morning in Vasselheim.

3373
03:35:03,093 --> 03:35:06,097
LAURA: Pike, speaking of clerics, do you want to
check in with your temple?

3374
03:35:06,097 --> 03:35:12,021
MATT: Pike has actually stayed back in Whitestone
to help the refugees.

3375
03:35:12,021 --> 03:35:13,283
TRAVIS: Yep.

3376
03:35:13,283 --> 03:35:15,929
LAURA: Oh. She didn't even come to Vasselheim?

3377
03:35:15,929 --> 03:35:20,638
MATT: No, but she did say that she's going to keep
an eye, best she can, through Sarenrae. When she

3378
03:35:20,638 --> 03:35:24,564
can pop in, she'll try and see if she can project
her form, going forward.

3379
03:35:24,564 --> 03:35:26,020
LIAM: She's led by her conscience.

3380
03:35:26,020 --> 03:35:29,588
MATT: She's led by her schedule in New York.
(laughs)

3381
03:35:29,588 --> 03:35:33,624
TALIESIN: We didn't think to leave her a stone,
did we?

3382
03:35:33,624 --> 03:35:35,648
MATT: If you'd like to, you could have.

3383
03:35:35,648 --> 03:35:38,530
SAM: Would we have done that?

3384
03:35:38,530 --> 03:35:42,607
TALIESIN: I would have definitely suggested
leaving her with one of the stones.

3385
03:35:42,607 --> 03:35:46,459
LAURA: Yeah, we probably should leave the stone
with her so she can pop in with us.

3386
03:35:46,459 --> 03:35:50,941
MATT: Okay. We'll say that she does that. She
keeps a gatestone with her, just in case.

3387
03:35:50,941 --> 03:35:52,991
TRAVIS: Trinket stays in Emon, right?

3388
03:35:52,991 --> 03:35:54,184
LAURA: Shut up!

3389
03:35:54,184 --> 03:35:56,148
TALIESIN: Trinket's going to guard the castle.

3390
03:35:56,148 --> 03:36:01,545
LAURA: Trinket is right here, right now! He has
been quiet, because he's really well-behaved.

3391
03:36:01,545 --> 03:36:06,142
MATT: Trinket's been practicing his stealth. (bear
grunts)

3392
03:36:06,142 --> 03:36:08,797
LAURA: So stealthy, darling.

3393
03:36:08,797 --> 03:36:12,364
MATT: All right, so you've set up your rooms, your
stuff about you. You have a full day before

3394
03:36:12,364 --> 03:36:15,528
seemingly anyone from the Slayer's Take is going
to come back. Where do you want to head?

3395
03:36:15,528 --> 03:36:17,048
TALIESIN: Individual?

3396
03:36:17,048 --> 03:36:19,072
TRAVIS: Individuals? Yeah.

3397
03:36:19,072 --> 03:36:21,491
LIAM: Oh, shit, can we buy potions in this city?

3398
03:36:21,491 --> 03:36:22,697
TALIESIN: I don't know.

3399
03:36:22,697 --> 03:36:24,176
LIAM: Shit! You can't, can you?

3400
03:36:24,176 --> 03:36:26,172
LAURA: I'm afraid to start anything. It's 11:00.

3401
03:36:26,172 --> 03:36:27,741
MARISHA: I know, it's late.

3402
03:36:27,741 --> 03:36:33,821
MATT: All right. Then we will end it there this
evening. I just wanted to get an idea of where you

3403
03:36:33,821 --> 03:36:35,031
guys were going for next week.

3404
03:36:35,031 --> 03:36:36,149
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3405
03:36:36,149 --> 03:36:38,696
TRAVIS: I plan to go see Earthbreaker Groon.

3406
03:36:38,696 --> 03:36:39,839
MATT: Okay.

3407
03:36:39,839 --> 03:36:42,504
LAURA: I want to wait and talk to Zahra.

3408
03:36:42,504 --> 03:36:43,520
MATT: Okay.

3409
03:36:43,520 --> 03:36:45,922
TALIESIN: I may want to have a conversation at the
temple of the Raven Queen.

3410
03:36:45,922 --> 03:36:47,018
MATT: Okay.

3411
03:36:47,018 --> 03:36:49,590
SAM: Zahra sounds fun.

3412
03:36:49,590 --> 03:36:52,828
LAURA: Right? But I do want to buy potions, as
well, and stock up.

3413
03:36:52,828 --> 03:36:54,737
TALIESIN: Yeah, that, too.

3414
03:36:54,737 --> 03:36:57,801
LIAM: Nothing. I'd probably tag along with
Percival.

3415
03:36:57,801 --> 03:37:01,720
LAURA: What?

3416
03:37:01,720 --> 03:37:03,807
TRAVIS: Old punchy man? You don't want to come
with?

3417
03:37:03,807 --> 03:37:06,476
SAM: Oh. Yeah, I'll come watch you if you're going
to have a fight.

3418
03:37:06,476 --> 03:37:08,237
TRAVIS: No, I'm going to have a conversation.

3419
03:37:08,237 --> 03:37:10,082
LIAM: You're right. I do want to see Old Punchy
Man.

3420
03:37:10,082 --> 03:37:11,419
TALIESIN: We can do both.

3421
03:37:11,419 --> 03:37:12,618
TRAVIS: Some hand-to-hand?

3422
03:37:12,618 --> 03:37:16,134
SAM: Watch you lose again.

3423
03:37:16,134 --> 03:37:19,086
TRAVIS: I'm not fighting him!

3424
03:37:19,086 --> 03:37:24,235
MATT: All right, so Vax and Scanlan are going with
Grog to the Trial Forge.

3425
03:37:24,235 --> 03:37:29,553
LAURA: I'm going to stock up on a bunch of stuff.

3426
03:37:29,553 --> 03:37:31,847
MATT: Okay. We'll do some shopping.

3427
03:37:31,847 --> 03:37:35,741
TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the temple of the
Raven Queen. I also want to

3428
03:37:35,741 --> 03:37:37,264
talk to our mapmaker friend.

3429
03:37:37,264 --> 03:37:40,282
MATT: So you're going to the Raven's Crest. Got
it.

3430
03:37:40,282 --> 03:37:41,133
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3431
03:37:41,133 --> 03:37:45,821
MATT: All right, cool. We'll pick it up next week
at that point, guys. Awesome. Well done, guys!

3432
03:37:45,821 --> 03:37:50,779
TRAVIS: We abandoned Greyskull Keep.

3433
03:37:50,779 --> 03:37:51,746
MARISHA: Yeah, we did.

3434
03:37:51,746 --> 03:37:53,422
LAURA: Yeah, we did, and it's sad.

3435
03:37:53,422 --> 03:37:55,612
MARISHA: It's very sad. We abandoned Emon.

3436
03:37:55,612 --> 03:37:56,834
MATT: Damn.

3437
03:37:56,834 --> 03:38:02,539
LAURA: We can't help it from there. We have to go
somewhere else in order to come back to it.

3438
03:38:02,539 --> 03:38:06,587
LIAM: Greyskull Keep is going to be an ancient
dragon's kitty litter box.

3439
03:38:06,587 --> 03:38:09,338
TRAVIS: I'm allergic to cats.

3440
03:38:09,338 --> 03:38:10,696
MARISHA: If you love it, you have to--

3441
03:38:10,696 --> 03:38:11,790
MARISHA and LAURA: Let it go.

3442
03:38:11,790 --> 03:38:14,188
LIAM: Like our first hometown, or our elven town?

3443
03:38:14,188 --> 03:38:15,650
LAURA: Don't say that.

3444
03:38:15,650 --> 03:38:23,531
TALIESIN: I was going to say, do you know who
says, "if you love it, you have to let it go?" The

3445
03:38:23,531 --> 03:38:26,320
one who got dumped, that's who! Sorry.

3446
03:38:26,320 --> 03:38:27,553
MATT: That's horrible.

3447
03:38:27,553 --> 03:38:30,417
TALIESIN: Yeah, you are. I'm a terrible person.

3448
03:38:30,417 --> 03:38:35,475
MATT: Well, guys. Thank you so much for watching.
We'll pick this up next Thursday. Those we'll see

3449
03:38:35,475 --> 03:38:42,485
tomorrow in Colorado, looking forward to it, and
tomorrow, look for my next episode of GM Tips.

3450
03:38:42,485 --> 03:38:45,258
That'll be fun, and is it Thursday yet?

3451
03:38:45,258 --> 03:38:50,434
TALIESIN: See you in Arizona!
