NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.084
MATT: Yep.

00:00:02.132 --> 00:00:09.004
MARISHA: There you go! People are joining. Give it
a little bit of time.

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.444
MATT: Give it a second. Sorry, my phone died!

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.124
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:16.494
MATT: Because Periscope eats your battery.

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:19.538
MARISHA: Periscope <i>destroys</i> your battery.

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:30.734
MATT: But good news is it saved me the time of you
guys awkwardly watching me unravel so much. It's

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:40.045
an involved process releasing a red dragon from
its prison.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:46.233
MARISHA: Sorry, guys, Matt's phone died, people
who are just joining.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:57.275
MATT: It's okay. Getting there.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:01.864
MARISHA: No, that's not Kelly Clarkson, that's
P!nk! Come on, now! Come on.

00:01:01.864 --> 00:01:05.994
MATT: Oh my god, there's so much of these little
things everywhere!

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:11.143
MARISHA: That's what she said?

00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:21.463
MATT: Hey-o! Cut him out. Crazy. There's too
many!

00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:24.934
MARISHA: Free him from his shackles!

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:42.814
MATT: Ugh! They secured the hell out of this guy,
understandably so. I'm glad there's not going to

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:49.504
be video on the internet of me awkwardly
attempting to free Thordak from his box.

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:54.895
MARISHA: Someone said we should make this one a
space dragon and put all the NASA stickers on him.

00:01:54.895 --> 00:02:13.834
MATT: That's a cool idea. Missed that one, too. So
many little wrappings! Ugh! Relinquish my dragon,

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.532
I want to play with him!

00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:18.424
MARISHA: This how every dad feels on Christmas
morning.

00:02:18.424 --> 00:02:27.395
MATT: "How do I get this thing working?! Oh, be
patient, Jeremy! You'll get your present!" All

00:02:27.395 --> 00:02:34.065
right. There's that. He's free.

00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:41.904
MARISHA: Dear god, this has turned into an epic
trilogy. You know this is going to be a thing.

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:46.512
MATT: I got a fire breathe, it looks like. That's
going in the right direction.

00:02:46.512 --> 00:02:51.664
MARISHA: Is getting it out of the box half of the
challenge? Does that add to his challenge rating?

00:02:51.664 --> 00:02:54.735
MATT: I think so, yeah. Nah, I'm about to lose
this battle against Thordak, at the moment, so

00:02:54.735 --> 00:03:05.786
don't feel too bad. Oh, it's underneath? What the
shit?!

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:12.403
MARISHA: Azerith says it took him a good 20
minutes to open his when he first got it! That's

00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:14.813
good to know. Thanks for the heads up, Azerith.

00:03:14.813 --> 00:03:24.784
MATT: I don't feel quite so bad about it. Damn,
man! Jesus! Thordak does not want to be unleashed.

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:27.932
Thordak's like, "I'm good, guys! I'm fine! I'll
just--"

00:03:27.932 --> 00:03:31.569
MARISHA: Maybe if you get the tape off the back?
There's tape up the back.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.664
MATT: Yeah, you know what? Here's how I'm going to
do this.

00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:46.504
MARISHA: How do you want to do this, babe? It's
kind of hilarious from this perspective because

00:03:46.504 --> 00:03:50.833
it's just cardboard. It looks like you're battling
cardboard.

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:52.375
MATT: I'm losing.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:57.284
MARISHA: You look like so many people I've seen on
Hollywood Boulevard, man, just battling cardboard.

00:03:57.284 --> 00:04:06.151
Go, you got this! Keyleth is level 13.

00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:10.923
MATT: And with that, ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:10.923 --> 00:04:12.504
MARISHA: What'd you get?

00:04:12.504 --> 00:04:18.433
MATT: That is Thordak. The other Thordak. There
are now two Thordaks.

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:21.595
MARISHA: No!

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:27.433
MATT: It's so fucking beautiful. You guys don't
even know what you've done tonight.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:34.977
MARISHA: (silly voice) "Hey guys! Hi! I'm Thordak!
It's mighty nice to be free from that cardboard prison!"

00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:37.729
MATT: (silly voice) "There aren't rules in the
book for my challenge rating!"

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:38.887
MARISHA: What.

00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:44.958
MATT: What? No. That's weird. Why would I say
that? That's weird. It's fun to freak them out.

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:49.608
It's really a lot of fun. Travis has the best
reactions.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:54.928
MARISHA: Yeah, he scares easy, which is funny.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:57.927
MATT: He's always like, "So what does that mean?"

00:04:57.927 --> 00:05:03.106
MARISHA: He might be the biggest scaredy-cat out
of everybody in real life. In real life, I think

00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:10.927
he jumps more at scary movies. He's afraid of
heights. He freaks out about dangerous things a

00:05:10.927 --> 00:05:18.429
lot. It's my favorite. In-game, he gives zero
fucks. It's my favorite.

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:28.188
MATT: You guys wanted to see a comparison size,
here. There's Thordak and the minis that I got tonight.

00:05:28.188 --> 00:05:37.738
MARISHA: Look at that big old bastard.

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:46.367
MATT: (silly voice) "Hey guys! What's going on
this way?" (growling)

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:49.668
MARISHA: How'd that go again?

00:05:49.668 --> 00:06:01.479
MATT: (growling) (heavy breathing) I'm an adult.

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.089
MARISHA: Was that the mock battle? That was the
mock battle? That was the run-through. I was going

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.998
say, he didn't use his breath weapon.

00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:13.248
MATT: He does now! (whooshing) Use it like a club.
Ugh!

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:19.327
MARISHA: That satisfying?

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:22.011
MATT: (whooshing)

00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:25.980
MARISHA: Call that the Scanlan special.

00:06:26.014 --> 00:06:27.340
MATT: Exactly.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.760
MARISHA: Gandalf!

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.580
MATT: My breath weapon.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.151
MARISHA: You looked more like Gandalf. You're too
cute to have a breath weapon. You're like mep!

00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:43.053
MATT: (strange noises)

00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:46.805
MARISHA: (silly voice) "Hey guys, look at my
little breath weapon! It's so cute!"

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:51.444
MATT: With that, folks, me and Marisha and Thordak
The Cinder King would like to wish you all a

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:57.814
wonderful evening's rest. Thank you for kicking
along with us tonight for as long as you have.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:01.326
We'll see you guys next week.

00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:05.515
MARISHA: Do one more. Yeah, look at his six pack.

00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:22.810
MATT: (deep voice) "I work out, don't worry. I've
been doing CrossFit for about six months, guys."

00:07:22.864 --> 00:07:26.273
MARISHA: All right.

00:07:26.342 --> 00:07:40.924
MATT: That's Thordak dancing a little bit.
(gravelly voice) "Good night, everyone."
