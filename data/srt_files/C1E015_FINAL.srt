00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:04,922
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome back to Critical
Role. I know we missed you guys last week. We had

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:09,467
crazy E3 coverage and the stream was fantastic in
getting all that to you, and to me because I

3
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:15,159
couldn't be there. So thank you to the stream team
for making all of that happen last week. But we

4
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:20,998
return, nevertheless, to the wondrous realm of
Exandria, and the adventures that happen in this

5
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:25,638
wonderful world of Critical Role. It's been a
week. I'm a little crazed right now. So be

6
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:27,379
prepared for crazed Mercer today.

7
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:28,820
ORION: Yeah, crazed Mercer!

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:36,159
MATT: What could possibly go wrong? All right. So
before we get started here, a couple--
a few quick

9
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:42,375
things, cool things! First off, guys, our first
winner for our subscriber giveaway is Valmoncen.

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:49,351
Congratulations! You're going to win a signed
Player's Handbook and a signed cast photo so

11
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:53,346
congrats to you. And we'll be giving those away
for every 50 subscribers that we get throughout

12
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:57,076
the show tonight. So remember in order to be part

13
00:00:57,076 --> 00:01:02,985

be our next one and every 50 thereafter. So we'll be

14
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:10,863
giving away signed Player's Handbooks and signed
photos of the cast. Also, Facebook initiative that

15
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:15,215
we're putting out there now. For all you guys out
there who could, go to the-- Hi there Sam.

16
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:16,604
SAM: Hi!

17
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:21,354
MATT: (laughs) If you have an opportunity, go to
the Geek and Sundry Facebook Page,

18
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:29,062
facebook.com/geekandsundry, and share on there
both #CriticalRole and a reason why you think

19
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:35,135
people should watch the show. And we will be doing
a giveaway for all the folks that do that, and that'll include a

20
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:40,208
signed Player's Handbook, a signed photo, and this
fantastic D&amp;D Attack Wing Green Dragon Expansion

21
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:42,584
Pack, which is just a cool looking mini in
general.

22
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,921
MARISHA: I want that!

23
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:49,274
MATT: Well too bad. They're going to get it. You
guys. One of you magical people are going to get

24
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:55,843
this. So go to the Facebook of Geek and Sundry, share
your best reasoning to the world on there why

25
00:01:55,945 --> 00:02:03,618
people should check us out and maybe win that, which
would be cool. Also, as a heads up, let's

26
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:08,251
see, we have a new shirt up! I'm sure you've seen a
fantastic new Critical Role shirt. It's only a

27
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:12,740
two-week limited run again. It's designed by one
of our awesome fans, Matt Abernathy. Well done and

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,702
thank you!

29
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:15,078
(cheering)

30
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:16,548
ORION: Matt Abernathy! Did I say it right?

31
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:19,477
MATT: You did. I believe so. If not, you're
welcome to get angry at us on the internet.

32
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:22,588
But that just went up. It has our little
awesome 8-bit--

33
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:24,448
SAM: Is there a time limit on those, Matt?

34
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,550
MATT: Two weeks.

35
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,474
SAM: Two weeks?! You mean the people out there
have only two weeks to get this t-shirt?

36
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,853
MATT: This is true.

37
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:34,238
SAM: Will you tell me this. Is it made of fine
material? Is it a handcrafted t-shirt?

38
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,823
MATT: The finest. If there were a t-shirt to gird
your loins with, this is the one to do it.

39
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:42,605
SAM: You heard the man. The two weeks is ticking
now. Slightly less.

40
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:45,926
MATT: And to be fair, girding your loins does
actually involve cloth. Look it up on Google. It's

41
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:52,646
an interesting process, I think more people could
do it. It helps aerate the... anyway. And last

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:03:01,175
thing! There's a cool RPG app game that launched
today called Soul Hunters, on app stores, iOS and

43
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:06,414
Android I think, that I did some voice-over for a
few of the characters in the game. It's a fun project,

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,234
you should check it out. It just launched today.
But for the next 24 hours, anyone who downloads

45
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:15,957
the game and puts in the promo code "Critical
Role" will get a free champion that I voiced. An

46
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:22,203
awesome tank fellow who is a lot of fun, so go
check that out and get a free tank. And also for

47
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:28,788
every ten subs we have ten key giveaways for the
game. I think it is upwards close to $100 worth

48
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:35,945
in game giveaway material and free money and stuff
in the actual app itself. So every ten subscribers

49
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:40,489
we'll be putting out a special key to that winner
for use in the Soul Hunters game, so check that

50
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:42,329
out! Good times.

51
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,707
SAM: Wait. Marisha. Say thank you for that thing.

52
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:53,233
MARISHA: Thank you to whomever got us this amazing
super cool looking bottle of scotch!

53
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,551
MATT, TRAVIS AND ASHLEY: What?

54
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,064
LAURA: Whoa, that's magic.

55
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,158
MARISHA: I know. Check that out.

56
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,140
ORION: It's Taurez.

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,253
MARISHA: It's Taurez Brandy.

58
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:00,963
LAURA: Wait! Wait, there was a card on the box.

59
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:02,007
SAM: Oh yeah.

60
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,047
MARISHA: There was a card on the box.

61
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:04,240
SAM: But that would be over there somewhere.

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,437
MARISHA: We sort of wanted it now, so we jumped
the gun. I blame Sam.

63
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,076
MATT: Where's the card and the box?

64
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:11,373
SAM: I threw the card on the floor and took the
scotch.

65
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:15,595
ZAC: Okay, you guys. There was a card with stuff
on there.

66
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:17,888
SAM: Oh! It's-- sorry.

67
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,822
MATT: If you don't mind, go ahead.

68
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:26,098
SAM: "Hi, Geek and Sundry Crew! So while this
package is actually mainly for the Critical Role

69
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,708
"cast, I hope that they share it with you guys,
too!"

70
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,964
MARISHA: Well...

71
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,359
LAURA: Oh! That's not going to happen.

72
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,392
SAM: Oh, I guess that means these guys. "It's a
small way of thanking you for all your hard work

73
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:40,410
"for bringing us Critical Role every week and
making my life a bit more bearable. I would so

74
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,622
"appreciate holding off on giving this to the cast
until the entire party is there--" Sorry Liam. "I

75
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:49,805
"should've also sent you a note for the cast,
through Twitch to go along with the package and it

76
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:53,719
"would be amazing if you could ensure that they get it along with the
package. Keep being awesome! Prometheus Theus."

77
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,620
MATT: Thank you, Prometheus Theus!

78
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,271
LAURA: See, that's why you read the card before
you open the box.

79
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:58,519
MARISHA: Thanks, Prometheus!

80
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,795
ORION: Thank you, Prometheus.

81
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:00,676
ASHLEY: Where's Taliesin?

82
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,886
MATT: Taliesin will be here shortly, he's running
a little behind. Yeah, the problem with having

83
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,873
this at 7PM on a Thursday in Los Angeles is that
depending on where you're coming from, you may

84
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,557
not get here by 7PM. But he'll be here shortly.

85
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,549
MARISHA: That's true, yeah, Taliesin's coming.

86
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:15,691
MATT: Thank you! That's amazing. And whenever that
is done, that bottle is going to be repurposed for

87
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,731
some sort of potion. It's happening.

88
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,523
ASHLEY: Oh, we could make it a candle.

89
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,278
MATT: Oh yeah. Whoa.

90
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:24,030
LAURA: Ashley makes awesome candles out of
bottles.

91
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,769
ASHLEY: Well you just put the lighter fluid and a
rope--

92
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:27,029
MATT: So we're doing that, right?

93
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,002
ASHLEY: Yeah.

94
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:33,374
MATT: That lives now as an alcoholic container,
but will eventually become an awesome on-set

95
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,545
candle. So thank you so much Prometheus, that's
amazing.

96
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,944
ORION: Yes, thank you Prometheus.

97
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,010
MARISHA: Thank you!

98
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,673
MATT: Also we have a couple other gifts to give
out. They weren't here last week so we couldn't

99
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:46,416
give them away yet, but we have a couple of gifts
over there for I believe Laura and Travis, or more

100
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,425
specifically Vex and Grog...

101
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,857
ZAC: We need to wait until
the end of the show.

102
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:50,903
MATT: To give those away?

103
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,109
ZAC: We have a ton of stuff to give you.

104
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:53,110
MATT: Oh! Really?

105
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,459
LAURA: Really? Are we waiting for the end?

106
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,458
SAM: Then let's wait.

107
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,434
LAURA: Okay.

108
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:58,119
ZAC: Yeah, we have a lot of presents to give you
guys.

109
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:01,513
MATT: Okay. Well then, we shall wait.

110
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:09,172
MARISHA: Hi Liam! We miss you so much!

111
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,520
LIAM: I know. I wish I was there.

112
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,947
MARISHA: Hi. How's New York?

113
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,168
LIAM: Muggy and hot.

114
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,531
MARISHA: Yay.

115
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:18,891
TRAVIS: We need better speakers.

116
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,221
ORION: Are you in a Broadway play?

117
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,649
LAURA: He is in a Broadway play.

118
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,706
ORION: Are you seeing Grease? Is that what's going
on?

119
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:28,189
MARISHA: (laughs) Seriously...

120
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,613
SAM: Hey, Travis.

121
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:34,657
MATT: All right. So we're getting better speakers
for Liam here, but he'll be up for joining us via

122
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,270
Skype, and Taliesin will be here shortly.

123
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,074
SAM: Okay. What do we got to do? Should we play
the game?

124
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,169
MATT: I think we're going to jump in here.

125
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:43,810
SAM: Okay! Everyone! Settle! Settle! Let's
play the game!

126
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,132
MATT: All right, we're going to get a speaker set
up for Liam, but nevertheless we shall hop

127
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,248
in here and start playing.

128
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:50,589
LAURA: It's chaos today.

129
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:53,444
MATT: Oh yeah. And I would like to recommend also
that we try to prevent cross-talk, so be aware.

130
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:59,442
MATT and LAURA: (sing) Cross-talk.

131
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:05,136
MATT: Oh, Crossfire. Some things never go away. All
right, so! For those of you who are joining us for

132
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,315
the first time, welcome. For those of you who have
been with us for the entire journey, welcome as

133
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:14,622
well. Bunch of crazy voice actors here, playing
D&amp;D. The party had just recently completed an

134
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:21,111
extensive quest through the Underdark beneath the
dwarven city of Kraghammer, in which they battled

135
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:27,512
with mind flayers, and duergar, and eventually a
giant crazed beholder that was possessed by an

136
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:31,669
ancient artifact called the Horn of Orcus. Upon
defeating the mind flayers and making a dramatic

137
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:37,950
escape, thanks to Tiberius, back to their hometown
of Emon, they met with the council of Tal'Dorei,

138
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,294
which they're a part of, to discuss what they
should do with this great, ancient, evil artifact,

139
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:46,500
the Horn of Orcus. The council discussed it, most
of the knowledge seemed to be that it could not,

140
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,481
or there is no known way to destroy it. The best
means of dealing with it would be to reseal it in

141
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:56,828
a place where it would be safe, forgotten, and
hopefully never rediscovered. It was decided

142
00:07:56,828 --> 00:08:01,909
amongst the council that the safest place to do
that is on the distant land of Othanzia, where

143
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:09,115
there is a capital city known as Vasselheim.
There, supposedly, is the most well known,

144
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:18,017
holiest, and oldest place of Kima's order of
worship, of the Great Platinum dragon Bahamut, of

145
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:23,467
which she's a paladin, and supposedly they have a
facility or means of sealing it away. So it was

146
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:29,550
decided that they would send away for a holy
container that could contain this evil without any

147
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:37,287
worry of corruption or escape, carry it then, via
skyship, over the ocean to the distant land of

148
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:41,773
Othanzia, to Vasselheim, the capital city, and
seal it away. After which, they went on a shopping

149
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:49,685
spree to Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Met everyone's
favorite mage, magic creator extraordinaire.

150
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:53,920
LAURA: Oh that's right! I want some stuff. Give me
stuff.

151
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,539
MATT: Yeah, you guys have to figure out who gets
what, by the way.

152
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,058
SAM: But we have to do this quickly.

153
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:02,426
MATT: So bringing us back now, you've completed
your purchases, now as a party decide how to

154
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:11,358
disseminate the items you've purchased. And once
you guys are ready, we'll take it from there.

155
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:13,415
SAM: Okay, how many items do we have?

156
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:18,928
MARISHA: Well they're a bit divvied up right now.
I believe Pike is holding

157
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,596
onto the sword, correct?

158
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,867
ASHLEY: And I also have a Pearl of Power, which is
up for grabs.

159
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,026
LAURA: Ooh, what is that. Let me see, let me see.

160
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:33,143
MARISHA: I'm holding on to a Ring of Protection
plus two, and a Belt of Dwarvenkind. Hello Percy!

161
00:09:33,143 --> 00:09:34,334
TALIESIN: Oh, hello.

162
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,284
MARISHA: Hi!

163
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,312
ORION: Hello, Percy.

164
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:37,330
MARISHA: Good of you to join us!

165
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,857
TALIESIN: Thank you, I just got off an airplane.
Hi.

166
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:40,238
MARISHA: Yes, how was your flight?

167
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:41,610
ORION: An airplane?

168
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,958
TALIESIN: The flight was-- it was slightly shorter
than the drive here. Hi.

169
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,085
ORION: Oh my god.

170
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,047
MARISHA: That sounds about right.

171
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,213
TALIESIN: This looks good.

172
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:53,987
MARISHA: Please! Look what we got. This is a gift
from-- what's his--

173
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:55,940
SAM: Oh! What's-his-butt has something.

174
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,116
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) It's really good!

175
00:09:58,116 --> 00:09:59,790
MARISHA: It's brandy! It's really good brandy.

176
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,116
SAM: Vax has something.

177
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:02,196
LAURA: Vex. He's Vex.

178
00:10:02,196 --> 00:10:02,972
SAM: Jesus.

179
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,012
LAURA: Just kidding, I'm Vex (cackles).

180
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:06,574
LIAM: I have a Dagger of Life-Stealing, plus one.
I'd also like to say how much I enjoy being in

181
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:08,695
Travis's stomach like Uatu.

182
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,676
(all laugh)

183
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,839
SAM: Nice.

184
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,879
MATT: Love it.

185
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,958
MARISHA: I have a Ring of Protection plus two, and
a Belt of Dwarven-

186
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:21,623
SAM: What is that? What does that do?

187
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:25,778
MARISHA: It gives you a plus two bonus to AC and
saving throws while wearing this ring.

188
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,382
SAM: I need that.

189
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:30,270
MARISHA: And then I also have the Belt of
Dwarvenkind.

190
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,846
ASHLEY: Did you say the most amazing thing about
it?

191
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:34,474
MARISHA: The Belt of Dwarvenkind?

192
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:36,065
ASHLEY: Yeah.

193
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:41,845
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys remember this? It gives you
a plus two to your constitution modifier. You have

194
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:50,686
advantage on charisma/persuasion checks with
dwarves... and you have a 50% chance, each day at

195
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:52,791
dawn, of growing a full beard.

196
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,957
SAM: What?

197
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,477
TALIESIN: Yeah!

198
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:56,549
ASHLEY: I. Know.

199
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:57,697
LAURA: That's amazing!

200
00:10:57,697 --> 00:10:58,726
TRAVIS: What.

201
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,866
MARISHA: If you are incapable of grow-- oh, that's
right, because you guys tuned out!

202
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:03,279
LAURA: That's right, we weren't here!

203
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,218
MARISHA: Yeah. We realized this at the end of the
stream. At the top of the day, you have a 50%

204
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:13,975
chance each day at dawn of growing a full, thick
beard if you are capable of growing one, or a

205
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:17,447
visibly thicker beard if you already have one.

206
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:19,883
TRAVIS: Wait, Tiberius is the only one that
couldn't grow a beard right?

207
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,693
LAURA: Right? We could all grow a beard...
technically.

208
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:22,944
TRAVIS: The ladies could get some stank beards.

209
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,165
SAM: Can the ladies grow a beard?

210
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,080
TRAVIS: Yeah!

211
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,116
LAURA: We could, why not?

212
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:27,481
ASHLEY: I mean, if our hormones were a little
different--

213
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,737
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've seen some nasty she-beards out
there.

214
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:32,162
TALIESIN: We can find them a nice lady to date. I
think it would work out pretty well.

215
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:36,439
MARISHA: And if you aren't a dwarf, on top of
this, you gain the following additional benefits

216
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:40,949
while wearing this belt. You have advantage on
saving throws against poison, resistance against

217
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:47,185
poison damage, darkvision up to 60 feet. You can
speak, read and write Dwarvish.

218
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:55,670
TALIESIN: I got one, too. I got the Manual of
Quickness of Action.

219
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,623
MARISHA: That one, you should keep.

220
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:59,311
TALIESIN: I'm keeping this one.

221
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:04,998
LAURA: Do you guys have a problem if I keep the
Pearl of Power?

222
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:06,365
SAM: What does it do?

223
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:12,235
LAURA: It lets you use another third spell slot,
3rd-level spell. And I figure you guys all have

224
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:15,520
better spells than 3rd-level, but I only have up
to 3rd-level.

225
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,450
SAM: So it just gives you one more 3rd-level
spell?

226
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,588
LAURA: Of my most powerful spell, which is my
3rd-level.

227
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,069
MARISHA: That's just fine with me.

228
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:23,350
LAURA: And they usually do a lot of damage with
the 3rd-level.

229
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,251
MARISHA: That's fine with me, I generally have
enough spell slots.

230
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:30,184
LAURA: You got that Ring of Protection. Or you can
have the beardy thing.

231
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:37,130
MARISHA: So yes, we also got the Coldsnap Leather
Armor, plus two, which I was originally thinking

232
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:41,333
for myself, but then I realized I actually have
decent leather armor that gives me spell

233
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,532
advantage, so I'm good on leather armor.

234
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:48,085
ORION: I could stand to wear it. I have no torso
armor.

235
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:51,866
MARISHA: I thought-- are you sure sorcerers can
wear it? I thought they could wear robes.

236
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:55,381
ORION: Cloth and leather. I mean, I just...

237
00:12:55,381 --> 00:13:00,877
MATT: Sorcerers can wear no armor. You are wrong.

238
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,207
ORION: I can wear no armor.

239
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,136
MATT: No.

240
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:07,779
ORION: I have this thing that somebody can use.

241
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:16,505
LIAM: Wait, I would just like to say, (creepily)
"Wade."

242
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,909
SAM: Thank you... Vax

243
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,912
MARISHA: Do you have any armor on, Scanlan?

244
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:23,482
SAM: I have something.

245
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:30,057
ORION: This would bring his-- with that and the
ring, if you wore this and the ring, it would give you

246
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:38,683
plus three to your AC. So that's not a bad combo.
Because this will give you plus one to your AC.

247
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:40,853
MATT: You have regular Studded Leather Armor right
now.

248
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,517
SAM: What is that? How is that... is this better?

249
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:43,838
MATT: Probably.

250
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:47,711
MARISHA: Would that give him a plus two to his
AC?

251
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:55,530
MATT: Coldsnap Leather Armor. This would be
leather armor, plus two, it would probably give

252
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,583
you an additional plus one to your AC if you wear
it.

253
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,700
SAM: Plus one.

254
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,776
MATT: It's not studded leather, it's just leather,
but it's plus two to the AC, so yeah. Your AC

255
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,532
would go up by one.

256
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:07,130
MARISHA: Who wants the Belt of Dwarvenkind? Grog?
What's your constitution right now?

257
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,175
TALIESIN: I think Pike should have the belt.

258
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:10,243
TRAVIS: 18?

259
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,912
LAURA: That's pretty high.

260
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:14,375
MARISHA: Constitution up to a 20.

261
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:21,147
TRAVIS: I want to grow a fucking beard. I know it
does other things, but with a beard--

262
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:23,796
ASHLEY: The only reason any of us want that belt
is to grow a beard.

263
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,442
MARISHA: Yeah that's true. I'm not going to lie.

264
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:31,440
ASHLEY: I mean, even though there's some very
great... aspects... to the belt. That's a plus.

265
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,322
TALIESIN: My question is, once you grow the beard,
if you remove the belt, does the beard fall off or

266
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:37,649
do you get to keep the beard? Because then you
guys could just switch around, until everyone had

267
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,622
the appropriate amount of facial hair.

268
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:41,052
SAM: I'll take the armor.

269
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:43,768
MARISHA: Or does it dissipate at the end of the
day when you take it off?

270
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:47,642
LAURA: I think that's our wonderful Matt Mercer's
call.

271
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,336
TRAVIS: I'll take it, we can hold it until
somebody else wants it.

272
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:51,542
MATT: You have no way of knowing.

273
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,483
ORION: So who's going to take the ring?

274
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:56,164
SAM: What does the ring do?

275
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:57,867
LAURA: Keyleth, I think, would like the ring.

276
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,357
MARISHA: I would just like something to help my
AC.

277
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,840
SAM: What's your AC?

278
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,184
MARISHA: 15.

279
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:04,704
ORION: That would bring you to 17.

280
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,096
SAM: Mine's a 14.

281
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:07,866
MATT: It is now 15 with your new armor.

282
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:12,324
SAM: 15. All right, you take it. I'll just die a
lot.

283
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:14,683
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa, no. Not cool.

284
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,294
MARISHA: Are you sure? I'd feel bad.

285
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:17,361
TALIESIN: I wouldn't.

286
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,890
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan, what's your constitution?

287
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,040
SAM: 15.

288
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,657
ASHLEY: You'd look pretty good with a beard.

289
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,834
LAURA: You would look really good with a beard.

290
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,266
TALIESIN: Well, that solves it.

291
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,035
SAM: Well wait, I thought Grog was taking the
beard.

292
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,895
ASHLEY: Grog has it. Maybe you guys can switch out
sometimes.

293
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:37,078
SAM: Take it. It's a belt, we can just-- oh, but
we have to bind it to us.

294
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:37,949
TRAVIS: You can have it.

295
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:39,075
SAM: No, no, you take it.

296
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,696
MARISHA: Because Grog doesn't wear armor either.
He has better benefits if he doesn't wear armor.

297
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:44,458
TALIESIN: There hasn't been enough in-game time
for this to have actually taken hold yet,

298
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,649
has there?

299
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,887
MARISHA: You keep take that, I think. It gives
you a bonus to your dex.

300
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:51,365
TALIESIN: The Manual of Quickness of Action. It
takes 48 hours worth of reading it.

301
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:52,541
MATT: Not yet.

302
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,282
TALIESIN: Okay. So I'll have to wait... I'm
starting this.

303
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:58,343
MATT: You can read it over time, like take a
couple hours out of each evening, then...

304
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:00,762
MARISHA: But that means everybody got something,
right?

305
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:02,086
ORION: Yes.

306
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,064
LAURA: Yes?

307
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:03,968
MARISHA: Did we divide it up that way?

308
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:04,956
SAM: We divide everything up?

309
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:05,774
ORION: Yes.

310
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:06,802
LAURA: The only one who didn't is my brother.

311
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:11,953
LIAM: No, I have a Dagger of Life-Stealing, which
steals life.

312
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:16,235
ORION: And also, Scanlan-- and I bring out the
Ioun Stone.

313
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:17,469
SAM: Oh, yes.

314
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:22,132
ORION: Like I was saying before, you ran out of--
you kept running out of spells. This allows you to

315
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:28,840
store extra spells. I propose a friendly trade for
the crown-- circlet-- hat?

316
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,644
Whatever you're wearing.

317
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:32,426
LAURA: The circlet with the hat.

318
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,590
ORION: Is it a circlet?

319
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,759
SAM: The Concentration Circlet?

320
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,639
ORION: Yes. I think it would benefit you to have
the ring, some sort of spell storing, which you've

321
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,946
complained about running out of spells the last
few times we've fought.

322
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:47,267
LAURA: Oh. Sorry... sorry. I took that pearl and
you wanted it, huh?

323
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:53,308
SAM: The pearl, yes I did want the pearl, but...
what? (confused laugh)

324
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:57,316
MARISHA: It does what the pearl does but times
three.

325
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,893
SAM: What does it do?

326
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:04,166
MATT: It allows you to cast a spell into it, up to
a level three. You can do three 1st-level spells,

327
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:10,243
or up to one 3rd-level spell, into the stone.
It'll hold it. And then you can continue on with

328
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,156
the next few days and you can cast it from the
stone for free.

329
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:15,233
ORION: You know how I keep casting? I keep hucking
spells because I keep casting them

330
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,939
out of my Ioun Stone.

331
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,236
SAM: So does that mean on one round I could cast a
spell and also activate the spell

332
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:20,340
that's stored in there?

333
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,462
MATT: It's still an action to activate it, but it
doesn't use your current spell slot, 'cause you've

334
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,804
already stored it in there the day before.

335
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:30,346
SAM: I've never run out of spells.

336
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:35,862
ORION: You ran out of spells the last two battles,
and you said that "I can't cast this anymore",

337
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,513
where you've--

338
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:40,652
SAM: So it gives me an extra level three slot?

339
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:43,956
MATT: Essentially, if you were to cast a level
three spell into it in advance.

340
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:49,445
ORION: Or you can cast, like, three of those, or
three of those. Things that you would use for

341
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,477
other deals.

342
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:52,966
MATT: Essentially. It's up to you. You have the
crown.

343
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:59,455
SAM: Let me think about it. Let's think about it
and strategize. We'll do this tonight? The three

344
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:05,425
level spells I don't use as much as these. But, if
that's what you'd like...

345
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:07,953
ORION: I would like that very, very much.

346
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,129
TRAVIS: Has Vax come back from his man date?

347
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:13,299
LAURA: Yeah. Are we done? Are we ready to do
things now?

348
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:15,092
TALIESIN: I've been looking forward to that
conversation for two weeks.

349
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,515
MARISHA: It's true. (giggles) That is a true
story.

350
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:21,017
TALIESIN: It's been sitting going, "Maybe he'll
say this!" I don't know.

351
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:25,486
SAM: Well. You did Silence me that time.

352
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,653
ORION: I had to.

353
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:28,729
SAM: You didn't have to.

354
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:30,414
TALIESIN: You did turn him into a mouse.

355
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:31,385
SAM: He liked it.

356
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:32,640
LAURA: Yeah, a super cute mouse!

357
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,033
ORION: No, I-- no. I was going to say you didn't
turn me back into a mouse.

358
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:39,660
SAM: You also abandoned the party in our most dire
moments.

359
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,039
LAURA: This is true as well.

360
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,548
TALIESIN: But he then did get the killing blow.

361
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:43,429
TRAVIS: True.

362
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:45,013
LAURA: That... doesn't add to...

363
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:48,752
SAM: Yes, so if I abandon you all and come in at
the last minute and take the last shot, I get all

364
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,902
the credit? I don't think so.

365
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:51,216
TALIESIN: I like to be contrary.

366
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:59,175
ORION: To be fair, gnome, I never abandoned the
party at all. I was surveying the situation. My

367
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:05,999
idea was not tried whatsoever. So I merely kept to
my word. I did not enter the premises. Only when I

368
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:09,808
needed to save everyone's life, which is exactly
what I did.

369
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:15,147
SAM: I'm so sorry, I missed the last part because
my awesome hat was blocking it, sorry.

370
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,921
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

371
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:21,079
ORION: It's too big, you're saying you can't wear
it?

372
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,457
SAM: We'll discuss soon.

373
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,561
ORION: That's not Clarota's thing, that's a
different thing, right?

374
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,034
MATT: Yeah, that Vax has.

375
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,897
LIAM: Yes, I have the Clarota hat.

376
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:33,133
ORION: And we still have that.

377
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,736
LAURA: And it looks wonderful on you.

378
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:36,568
TALIESIN: You look like Merlin from Excalibur.

379
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:38,627
TRAVIS: Are we still at Gilmore's?

380
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,702
MATT: You guys have exited Gilmore's at this
time.

381
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:43,494
LAURA: Are we standing out on the street divvying
up random items?

382
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:47,888
MATT: Yes. You guys are essentially in the middle
of the thoroughfare in Abadar's Promenade of

383
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:51,129
Emon, bickering over the items you guys are
distributing amongst

384
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:52,376
yourselves in broad daylight.

385
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:54,018
LAURA: Well I've got a beautiful pearl, so I'm
happy.

386
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,909
TALIESIN: I've got a book!

387
00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:02,108
TRAVIS: Are there any shady characters making eyes
at our goods?

388
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,144
MATT: Make a perception check.

389
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,588
TRAVIS: Me make a perception check?

390
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:07,473
MATT: Yes.

391
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,958
LAURA: Bust out those dice!

392
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:14,498
TRAVIS: 15 plus... probably crap. Zero.

393
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:20,189
MATT: (laughs) Looking about, there are a few
folks that walk by and give a strange eye to the

394
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:26,444
seven, nearly eight foot tall goliath. But nothing
beyond what you're used to.

395
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:28,221
TRAVIS: Oh, all right.

396
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:34,640
MATT: Yeah. As a note guys, you do have about two
days before the holy receptacle arrives so if

397
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,968
there's anything that you want to achieve in that
meantime, you're welcome to do so or you can just

398
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:42,371
spend that couple days and relax.

399
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:46,618
LAURA: What? I'm sorry Percy, are you talking?

400
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,000
TALIESIN: I have chicken!

401
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,376
TRAVIS: On you?

402
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,417
TALIESIN: I have some tinkering I'd like to do.

403
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,129
MATT: All right. What would you like to tinker?

404
00:20:54,129 --> 00:21:02,095
TALIESIN: I would like to try and build a couple
things. I have a list actually...

405
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,270
LAURA: Arrows! Arrows for me please. Darling?

406
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:13,082
TALIESIN: No, no. Arrows are on the list. I want
to start working on some sort of tazing implement

407
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:18,190
for direct contact. I want to do an electrical
charge that I can rev up.

408
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,553
MARISHA: He wants to make Asami's glove.

409
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:21,682
MATT: Okay.

410
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:28,164
TALIESIN: There's that. I have a list of things.
How many things can I start

411
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:30,466
poking with in two days?

412
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,966
MATT: That glove, that's going to be like a 
week-long endeavor.

413
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,711
TALIESIN: That's a week-long thing.

414
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,081
MATT: Even the design phase will take you about
two days, acquiring materials.

415
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,443
TALIESIN: Night vision.

416
00:21:38,443 --> 00:21:40,689
MATT: Night vision...

417
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:43,149
TALIESIN: Into my current, existing helmet.

418
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:49,255
MATT: Night vision, or darkvision, as you would
put it, would be more of an

419
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,886
enchantment-based acquisition.

420
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:52,530
TALIESIN: There's no way that I could try to pull
that together?

421
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,679
MATT: Not via tinkering.

422
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,501
TALIESIN: Damn it.

423
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:58,214
MATT: The technological aspects are not,
unfortunately, that advanced in this time. Like,

424
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:02,272
shades, probably. You could probably shade some
sun. But, actually looking in the dark, that's an

425
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:04,635
actual-- would be more of an arcane situation.

426
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:11,131
TALIESIN: So this boils me down to two thoughts.
This is good. I want to put a

427
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:19,300
slight dent into the barrel of Bad News to get a
ricochet shot, so that it basically allows me,

428
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:24,748
when I shoot a bullet, to also do 1d12 worth of
damage to one target that is immediately adjacent

429
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:27,341
to the main target.

430
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:29,739
MARISHA: Shrapnel?

431
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,799
TALIESIN: Shrapnel. It's not quite shrapnel,
it's a ricochet, but yes it is basically a

432
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,788
shrapnel shot.

433
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:34,764
ORION: Like a bank shot.

434
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:37,350
TALIESIN: Yeah, like a bank shot. A secondary
lesser damage.

435
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:42,146
MATT: With the Bad News. It's going to be
difficult with the Bad News because the sheer

436
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:46,341
power and force that that gun emits on its
payload.

437
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:50,430
TALIESIN: Would it be possible, if I did it to one
of the barrels of--

438
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,825
MATT: You could do it. I'd say it'd probably up
your misfire rate by one.

439
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,181
TALIESIN: Ah, okay.

440
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:59,641
MATT: So consider that. It's doable, but in
messing with the barrel, the chamber, and the

441
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:04,091
trajectory of the weapon, there is that slight
increase in the possibility of it jamming or

442
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,012
disabling.

443
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,058
TALIESIN: Okay.

444
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:09,521
MATT: It's a possible trade-off. With Bad News,
because it travels so fast to do that much damage,

445
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:14,196
any sort of alteration-- it will either not change
the course whatsoever, or it'll blow up the gun.

446
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:17,033
TALIESIN: I'll start the taser and work on some
arrows then. That's what I'd like to do.

447
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,560
MATT: Okay. Arrows are viable.

448
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,545
SAM: I go back into Gilmore's and I ask if
there's-- if either they or someone else they know

449
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:28,426
can make a specific kind of potion.

450
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:30,171
MARISHA: Oh, I actually join him.

451
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:32,284
MATT: All right. So the two of you walk back in as
they're discussing this.

452
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:34,227
Gilmore is still at his desk.

453
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:35,832
ORION: I'm going too.

454
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:39,675
MATT: All right. "I'm sorry, was there something
else you require?"

455
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:43,073
SAM: I forgot to ask-- Hello, Gilmore.

456
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,170
MATT: "Hello."

457
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,377
SAM: You look particularly perky today.

458
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:50,329
MATT: "I've had a rather good day, you could
say."

459
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:56,757
SAM: I was wondering if I could inquire about a
specific kind of scrying potion that I would like

460
00:23:56,757 --> 00:24:02,894
made for me. It's a specialty item. I don't know
if any exist.

461
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:07,866
MATT: "Please, do step into my office." And he
leads you into the back room, beyond the beaded

462
00:24:07,922 --> 00:24:09,692
curtain. (laughs)

463
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:12,313
SAM: Oh! Is that patchouli I smell?

464
00:24:12,313 --> 00:24:17,524
MATT: "Quite an astute nose you have. I'll be
right in. If you don't mind, just hanging tight

465
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:24,079
"just for a moment. Thank you." He steps off in the
back room and takes about five minutes.

466
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:30,548
MARISHA: While he's gone, can I look around to see
if he has any books on how to start-- like a

467
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:32,921
potion making for dummies book.

468
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,338
MATT: Okay. So.

469
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:50,060
SAM: Gilmore, when we get excited, I-- well, never
mind that. Anyway, I'm looking for a way, a potion

470
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:59,316
that I could maybe drink or use, to help me look
in on a place that we've been to recently. I could

471
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:06,541
maybe leave a mark of some sort, and then use that
mark to magically scry into that place.

472
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:11,962
MATT: He gives you a long, hard look,
contemplating the conversation, and then you see a

473
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:19,237
lightbulb go off in his eyes and he goes, "Hmm.
Curious. You're into some things."

474
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:21,835
(laughter)

475
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:23,341
SAM: I have a dark side.

476
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:29,643
MATT: "Indeed. I could probably acquiesce to this.
Give me a day. I should be able to produce such an

477
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:38,078
"item, although this is, I will say-- having not
been attempted, there comes a warning of possible

478
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,684
"side effects."

479
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:44,717
SAM: So I would be drinking this potion and it
could affect me in other ways.

480
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:52,939
MATT: "Perhaps. The funny thing about unproven
magic is, well, it's unproven. I could give you at

481
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:56,863
"least a 90 to 95% guarantee?"

482
00:25:56,863 --> 00:26:02,053
SAM: All right. And how much would such a potion
cost me?

483
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:09,699
MATT: "I would say for the research, the
materials, and seeing as how you are indeed

484
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:15,017
"sponsored by Gilmore's Glorious Goods. At
discount, 300 gold?"

485
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:18,496
SAM: Wow. Did I give away my ruby last time?

486
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,051
LAURA: I don't remember.

487
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:21,104
ORION: No, you still have it.

488
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:22,144
TRAVIS: You did not.

489
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:24,001
SAM: How much would this get me?

490
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,370
MATT: Go ahead and roll a persuasion.

491
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,310
TRAVIS: Come on buddy.

492
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,924
SAM: I don't have any dice! (laughs)

493
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,482
MATT: There you go!

494
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:35,314
LIAM: I almost gave away mine.

495
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:36,954
SAM: 23.

496
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,644
ASHLEY: That's a good one.

497
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:39,952
SAM: Oh. 21.

498
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:40,904
LAURA: Oh...

499
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:46,240
MATT: Right. Oh! (laughs) No, as soon as you
procure it, he leans forward and snatches it gingerly

500
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,703
from your fingers and looks it over in his eyes.
"Ooh! This is a fine piece."

501
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:54,773
LAURA: (whispering) It's super-duper flawless 
'cause you put it in the Wheel.

502
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:57,501
MATT: "For trade?"

503
00:26:57,557 --> 00:27:03,180
SAM: Just tell me how much it's worth first.

504
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,657
MATT: "This gem would probably run you anywhere from
200 to 300 gold."

505
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:13,166
SAM: Do I sense that he's lying?

506
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,580
MATT: Make an insight check.

507
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:22,574
SAM: Where'd it go? Thank you! Ooh! 11.

508
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,325
(laughter)

509
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,566
MATT: He seems honest. He seems like he's
genuinely looking to make a deal.

510
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,303
TRAVIS: Do it.

511
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:33,315
SAM: What?

512
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:34,296
TRAVIS: Just straight up.

513
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,094
LAURA: Do it.

514
00:27:35,094 --> 00:27:36,803
SAM: Yeah, let's do it. I'll give you the ruby for
the potion.

515
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:37,756
MATT: "Very well."

516
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,888
SAM: But I would love a hefty amount of a potion.
Not a single use, but multiple use.

517
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:50,823
MATT: "Oh. I can provide for this fantastic
specimen, a three use potion? Is that within your

518
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:53,782
"realm of possibility?"

519
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,936
SAM: That would be lovely, thank you, Gilmore.

520
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:56,966
MATT: "One day!"

521
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,361
SAM: One. One wonderful day!

522
00:27:58,361 --> 00:27:59,601
MATT: "One day."

523
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:00,875
SAM: One glorious day!

524
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,890
MATT: And he rubs your shoulder and leads you
outside of the room.

525
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,661
ORION: Wait! I have a two part question, Gilmore!

526
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:07,329
LAURA: I didn't even think you were in there.

527
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:08,444
ORION: I am!

528
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:09,720
LAURA: Oh! Okay.

529
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,765
MATT: Ha. Ha. As you storm through the beaded
curtain, as he's exiting. "Ah! I'm sorry, this

530
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:15,041
"room is private."

531
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,865
ORION: Oh. Everything's private, I guess.

532
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:19,566
(laughter)

533
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:29,194
ORION: I wanted to know, A: How much that ring of
Walking on Water was again, and B: If you knew of

534
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:37,449
somewhere that I could have an existing item
enchanted just a little bit. Like make it stronger

535
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,814
than it currently is, but not change it.

536
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:48,327
MATT: "First off, the ring that we discussed as
our original deal, the price would run you

537
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:50,017
"about 1,750."

538
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:51,577
ORION: 1,750?

539
00:28:51,577 --> 00:29:02,938
MATT: "1,750 gold pieces. Should you be interested
still. As for-- enchantment is a largely permanent

540
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:10,890
"process. To enhance an existing enchantment is a
dangerous task that has a very high probability of

541
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,167
"ruining the enchantment that currently exists."

542
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,190
ORION: Oh. That's good to know.

543
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:22,983
MATT: "To increase it, such masters I hear exist
in the world, but they are very, very dead. Or

544
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:24,897
"very, very hidden."

545
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,357
ORION: Hmm. Yes.

546
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:30,463
MATT: "However, if you wish to upgrade, we are
more than happy to oblige!"

547
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:43,265
ORION: No, the Ring of Protection that I have is
one measure. I wanted it by another measure.

548
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:51,233
I don't know how to phrase this in RP. So. I
wanted it to be-- to have--

549
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:52,190
SAM: More.

550
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,162
MARISHA: More protect-y.

551
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:54,169
SAM: More bigger.

552
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,221
MARISHA: More-- Yes.

553
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:59,327
MATT: "Well. Perhaps we could have one made for
you. It would take a few weeks, but we could have

554
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:00,453
"one waiting."

555
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:03,971
ORION: Oh, very good. I would like to arrange
that.

556
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:07,601
MATT: "All right. Well, you'd have to pay half the
price down in front." How much is your Ring of

557
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:11,246
Protection plus two currently labeled as?

558
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:14,180
MARISHA: 6,500.

559
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,066
ORION: Man.

560
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:25,328
MATT: "So 6,500. That will put you at 3,250 down
now. The other half when the enchantment is

561
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:26,528
"complete."

562
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:29,743
ORION: (quietly) That is insane. We didn't buy it
for that much, did we?

563
00:30:29,743 --> 00:30:32,230
MATT: They haggled it down a little bit.

564
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,401
MARISHA: We tossed it in with a deal and stuff.

565
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:35,488
TALIESIN: Stuff's expensive, man.

566
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:36,880
MARISHA: Stuff is expensive.

567
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,021
ORION: I'll chill for now.

568
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:40,476
MATT: "Very well. Come back if you change your
mind."

569
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:41,421
ORION: I will.

570
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:43,338
MARISHA: Wait, did I find a book?

571
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:47,824
MATT: Right. We'll get to that now. Roll an
investigation check.

572
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:55,229
MARISHA: 18.

573
00:30:55,229 --> 00:31:00,170
MATT: All right. Asking around some of the
employees and keeping an eye out, there are a few

574
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:06,490
books on herbalism, how to find and retain the
potent elements of various material components

575
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:15,427
found in nature. Also, there are some bits of
information about how to extract materials from

576
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:23,963
natural creatures, meaning monsters, beasts both
natural and magical. How to remove and preserve

577
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:28,961
safely elements of their organs, and things that
can be used in various alchemical compounds and/or

578
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:34,052
potion-brewing. There are no books specifically on
the process of brewing, but that is one of the key

579
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:37,053
components to it, is being able to acquire those
elements.

580
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:41,422
MARISHA: So I take those books. How much are those
books?

581
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:47,103
MATT: It's a single book that contains everything
about the herbalism and a book about the

582
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:50,225
extraction of creature components.

583
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:52,524
MARISHA: So I take that book. How much is that
book?

584
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:53,846
MATT: The two books.

585
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:55,578
MARISHA: How much are these books?

586
00:31:55,578 --> 00:32:06,063
MATT: (laughs) You inquire with the employees.
"These books are marked currently at 25 gold

587
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:13,955
"apiece. They are a second printing, but hard to
find. Do you wish to purchase?"

588
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:17,403
MARISHA: Yes, I'll take both of them. 50 gold.

589
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,473
MATT: Mark off 50 gold. Hands the tomes back.

590
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:23,428
MARISHA: Also, did I talk to Gilmore about potion
classes?

591
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:26,663
MATT: You did, and he said he'll take it under
consideration.

592
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:28,027
MARISHA: He'll take it into consideration. Okay.

593
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:29,694
MATT: He gave you a look like, "Hm."

594
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,926
MARISHA: Like, maybe? Okay.

595
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:34,410
TALIESIN: It's tough to tell. He sort of has that
look.

596
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,829
LAURA: Without taking too long on it, I was also
hoping, while we're in town. That armor that we

597
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:45,621
stole from the big rhinoceros monster in the
duergar castle?

598
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,282
MATT: Oh, the bulette.

599
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:51,015
LAURA: Yes. The armor that we took from him. Is
there any way I can find a blacksmith that can

600
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:53,638
maybe upgrade Trinket's armor with that?

601
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,096
SAM: Ooh.

602
00:32:55,096 --> 00:33:01,023
MATT: That's an interesting thought. All right. Go
ahead and make an investigation check.

603
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:10,992
LAURA: Okay. All right. Here we go. Pick wisely.
I'm using the new fancy one, so don't fail me.

604
00:33:11,148 --> 00:33:12,505
MARISHA: (singing) Don't fail me now.

605
00:33:12,505 --> 00:33:13,542
LAURA: 20?

606
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:18,708
MATT: 20. Easy enough. After asking around town,
you manage to find a few individuals to speak

607
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:24,335
with. There are two armor smiths. One that dabbles
in both blacksmithing and armor smithing, one that

608
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:32,447
specifically is an armor smith who focuses in
strange materials. Mostly ornamental, but has a

609
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:39,826
strong history and past in warfare and honing
those skills towards the use of actual battle. You

610
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:45,658
find it's a dwarven woman by the name of Karin,
and they send you to her facility. It's a very

611
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:50,351
small, almost a hovel, but when you approach the
outside, you can immediately smell this strong

612
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:58,456
scent of iron. Almost like a sulfur and different
other chemicals that are used when you're folding metals

613
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:04,720
and making composites. You open the door slightly,
and it's very darkly lit on the inside. There's

614
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:10,193
the heat of the forge, and you see this very
sturdy, muscular dwarven woman standing in there

615
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:14,687
with her hair graying, and it's pulled back into a
very tight bun. She's wearing a leather apron with

616
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:17,878
her sleeves rolled up, and she's in the process of
hammering down on a piece of metal over her anvil,

617
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:20,244
just (ping, ting, ting).

618
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:21,857
LAURA: Does she have a beard?

619
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:25,200
MATT: (laughs) You see, there's probably a bit of
scruff showing at the edge of her chin, but not a

620
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,018
beard per se. She doesn't seem to notice you.
She's just in the middle of her work.

621
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:33,293
LAURA: (clears throat)

622
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:38,707
MATT: She stops for a second. "Oh, sorry, I didn't
see you enter! Can I help you?"

623
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,274
LAURA: Karin, yes?

624
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:41,444
MATT: "Aye, I'm Karin."

625
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:44,562
LAURA: Don't mean to interrupt. You look very busy
here.

626
00:34:44,562 --> 00:34:46,176
MATT: "Let me just finish."

627
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,642
LAURA: All right.

628
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:51,770
MATT: She gives you a nod (huffs), and then goes
back into her mode for a second. She makes you

629
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,106
wait for a good six minutes while she finishes
hammering out this piece, turning and rotating on

630
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:59,327
the edge of the anvil, hammering it into this
smooth-- it looks almost like a pauldron, curved

631
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:04,503
point for a shoulder. Then eventually, she (shhh)
quenches it in the trough, sets it aside with a

632
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:11,118
(tink, tink). Puts her tools down, takes off her
big leather gloves. Wipes her brow, and you see

633
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:14,379
when she wipes it, she wipes the sweat off, but
leaves a big old grease mark where once was clean,

634
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:19,179
and goes, "Sorry for the wait. So, what can I do
for you?"

635
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:22,865
LAURA: I've heard rumor that you are a very
talented blacksmith.

636
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:25,976
MATT: "Oh, aye. Depends on what you're looking
for. What're you putting in the furnace?"

637
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:28,666
LAURA: I have quite an interesting proposition for
you.

638
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,471
MATT: "I like interesting."

639
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:32,929
LAURA: I may have some material you've never
worked with, I don't know.

640
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:34,823
LIAM: Oh, here we go.

641
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:40,228
LAURA: Would you mind stepping outside for a
moment? Get some fresh air?

642
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:47,836
MATT: At this point, specifically, she goes from
extremely welcoming to a very nervous, untrusting look.

643
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:49,872
LAURA: Believe me, you'll want to see this.

644
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:52,491
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

645
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:54,220
TRAVIS: Why didn't you wink first?

646
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,036
LAURA: You'll want to see this.

647
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:57,553
MATT: (laughs)

648
00:35:57,553 --> 00:36:00,568
LAURA: Ugh! I don't know which-- that's the
problem with having too many. I'm rolling my

649
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:02,682
Trinket die, since it applies to Trinket.

650
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,064
MATT: There you go.

651
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:06,173
LAURA: That wasn't good. Nine?

652
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:08,852
MATT: It's okay, she rolled a two.

653
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:09,978
LAURA: Yay!

654
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:18,871
MATT: "All right, all right. Sorry, I don't mean
to-- I've had a few encounters in the past."

655
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:20,061
LAURA: Oh.

656
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:23,609
MATT: "But yes, outside." She walks out, and as
she walks out with you, you can see she reaches

657
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:26,067
over and grabs a sheathed shortsword and keeps it
at her side.

658
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:29,241
LAURA: No need for that, darling. Trinket!

659
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:35,829
MATT: (bear moans) Your armored bear comes looming
around the corner, at which point she (yelps) goes

660
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:36,934
for the sword instinctually.

661
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:39,587
LAURA: No, no! Take a gander at his armor.

662
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:45,386
MATT: "Oh. That's not bad. That's not bad at all!"
She walks up to him and carefully-- doesn't want

663
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:46,390
to touch him--

664
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,560
LAURA: He's friendly, don't worry.

665
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,949
MATT: Trinket, of course, leans forward. (slurp)
Licks the side of her face, cleaning off some of

666
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:57,164
the grease stain on the side of her cheek.
"(shocked laughter) Oh! That was unexpected. Very

667
00:36:57,164 --> 00:36:58,334
"friendly one."

668
00:36:58,334 --> 00:37:00,608
LIAM: Matt Mercer.

669
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:02,071
MATT: "Trinket, is it?"

670
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,429
LAURA: Yes.

671
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,939
MATT: "You're a nice one, Trinket." She starts
rubbing the side of his cheek. (bear moans)

672
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,017
LAURA: He likes you. I can tell.

673
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,702
MATT: She starts looking at the armor. "It's nice.
Functional. It's taken a few dings. It's seen some

674
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:12,955
"battle."

675
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:15,736
LAURA: Yes, it has. I'm hoping to protect him a
bit more, however.

676
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:19,785
MATT: "Well, I can see that. Who made this?" She
looks around and pulls it. "Oh, this is the mark

677
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:23,845
of Westruun. This was made over in that--
(scoffs)."

678
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:25,604
LAURA: Yes. You can do better, I'm sure.

679
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:29,248
MATT: "Oh, they're not the finest over there.
They're functional, but not the finest. Is this

680
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,841
"for a parade or is this for actual combat?"

681
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:35,413
LAURA: Actual combat. Beauty? Not my concern.

682
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:38,684
MATT: "All right, all right. And what materials
are you looking for?"

683
00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:41,059
LAURA: Well. (grunts)

684
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:48,729
MATT: (laughs) As you slam down this awkward,
still somewhat wet in places, but mostly dried-out

685
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:55,883
bulette hide that you guys carved from it. And it
is big pieces of plate scales with sections of

686
00:37:55,883 --> 00:38:01,158
leather underneath, interwoven. It is part of a
large behemoth of a creature. As you slam it down,

687
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:07,158
she steps back for a second. "And you-- what
manner of creature did this come from?"

688
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:11,045
LAURA: A very large one, actually. A bull--

689
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:13,258
MATT: "Bulette?"

690
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,275
LAURA: Bulette. That one.

691
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:18,207
MATT: "Oh, I haven't seen one of those found
itself to the surface in quite some time."

692
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:22,105
LAURA: It wasn't on the surface. We're a bit of
adventurers, if you want to know.

693
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:32,163
MATT: She gives you this long look. Goes, "Right.
Right, adventurers. Of course. Sorry, didn't mean

694
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:33,356
"to offend."

695
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:36,205
LAURA: You've probably heard of us. Vox Machina?

696
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:40,908
MATT: She stops for a second and goes, "Actually,
yes. I have heard of you."

697
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:41,823
LAURA: Yeah?

698
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,261
MATT: "Winter's Crest festival not long ago."

699
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:44,912
LAURA: That is correct.

700
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:54,557
MATT: "All right. Well, then. It's a pleasure to
have you in my little establishment and business.

701
00:38:54,557 --> 00:38:59,744
"Bulette hide? I have not worked with this." She
leans down and starts messing with it, seeing how

702
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:07,330
pliable it is in sections. She goes, "There's
enough here to redo most of the armor. Most

703
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:13,162
"places. I could minimize spatial use of it and
possibly get most of the main plates gathered. I

704
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,990
"can work with this."

705
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,184
LAURA: Nice!

706
00:39:16,184 --> 00:39:20,384
MATT: "I can work with this. It'll take me a few
days, unfortunately. It is a rare material."

707
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:24,169
LAURA: Right. Is two days enough?

708
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:25,645
MATT: "Two days?"

709
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:26,792
LAURA: Yes.

710
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:30,945
MATT: "I could. I'd have to charge you more, 'cause
I'm not going to get much sleep at that rate."

711
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:35,419
LAURA: Understandable. How much is a bit more?

712
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:38,854
MATT: "Well, you're providing the materials. That
definitely cuts the cost significantly. For my

713
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,440
"time and work, and lack of sleep--"

714
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,427
LAURA: And we will send many, many customers your
way.

715
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:46,626
MATT: "Can I put my personal brand on this?"

716
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,068
LAURA: Of course.

717
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:49,334
ORION: Wait--

718
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:51,619
MATT: "Well, then." You're not there.

719
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:53,881
LAURA: (whispering) Trinket isn't sponsored, it's
just fucking us.

720
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,847
ORION: Okay.

721
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:58,129
MATT: "500 gold suffice?"

722
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:02,739
LAURA: How about 450?

723
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:06,014
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

724
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:07,597
LAURA: Shit.

725
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:08,845
MATT: Oh, Vex.

726
00:40:08,845 --> 00:40:10,833
SAM: Why must you dicker?

727
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,935
LAURA: Because I want to.

728
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:14,601
ASHLEY: Yeah!

729
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:21,607
LAURA: Wah-wah! That would be 26.

730
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:25,759
MATT: She looks you over for a second, looks at
the material, and you can see in her eyes, there's

731
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:33,541
this interest in working with this material, never
touched or worked with it. She goes,

732
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:37,191
"(spits) 450."

733
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:38,733
LAURA: (spits) Deal.

734
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:39,694
MATT: Shakes hands.

735
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:40,567
LAURA: See you in a few days.

736
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:41,243
MATT: "All right."

737
00:40:41,243 --> 00:40:42,142
LAURA: Two days.

738
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:47,365
MATT: "Two days. All right." And she leans down,
picks it up, it is heavy material-- for the most

739
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:52,266
part carrying it around was his job in the bag of
holding. She lifts it over one shoulder, (rgh)

740
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:53,922
heads right into the workshop--

741
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:54,929
LAURA: Thank you, Karin!

742
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:59,178
MATT: Stops for a second, turns around. "Do you
mind if I take that armor in the meantime? I

743
00:40:59,178 --> 00:41:00,821
"figure I could use that to base the pattern."

744
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:02,772
LAURA: Oh, of course, yeah! Use it together.
Trinket.

745
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:07,165
MATT: Take about 15 minutes, she helps take the
armor off, she leads it all into the shop, and she

746
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,691
goes, "All right. See you in a few days." Closes
her door. (bff)

747
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:18,486
LAURA: Trinket, look at you naked. So cute. All
right, sorry that took so long.

748
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:21,612
SAM: Hi, you're back! All right. Shall we start
adventuring, then?

749
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,161
ORION: Where? There's two days to hang out.

750
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:26,000
SAM: Two days, oh, we're not leaving yet?

751
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,978
LAURA: No.

752
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:28,969
SAM: I was mostly spacing out last time.

753
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,810
MATT: If there's anything else you guys want to
achieve in these next two days, you're welcome to

754
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,168
do it now, or we could go ahead and say you relax
and take the time to fast-forward through the

755
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:35,311
two-day period.

756
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:36,725
TALIESIN: I'll do my tinkering rolls and then I'm
good.

757
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,893
MATT: All right, so. First you wanted to work
on?

758
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:44,723
TALIESIN: I wanted to work on a grappling-hook
arrow that attaches to the unending-- that ties to

759
00:41:44,723 --> 00:41:48,419
the unending rope so that we have actually
something that will pierce

760
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,264
heavy stone and anchor.

761
00:41:50,264 --> 00:41:51,664
MATT: Okay, all right.

762
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:58,338
TALIESIN: Like Batman. I don't know why Batman's
on the brain right now. Could be any reason.

763
00:41:58,338 --> 00:41:59,878
MATT: All right.

764
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:11,723
ORION: I have an Earring of the Wind that I made
that I have not enchanted yet. Can I enchant that

765
00:42:11,723 --> 00:42:14,113
in two days to make another one?

766
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,614
MATT: Another one of the speaking earrings?

767
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:23,466
ORION: There is the existing functional one, but
over the time since I gave them out I only had

768
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:26,414
time to make one extra one, but I have to enchant
them also.

769
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:29,890
MATT: Yeah, I would say you could begin the process, you
get halfway through. It would take you the better

770
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:35,008
part of a week to complete the earring, which is
what it did before when you first made them. But

771
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:38,843
you can begin the process. You definitely have
your laboratory now in Greyskull Keep, and that

772
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:41,896
gives you a bonus to the rolls you make to
enchant it.

773
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:45,778
ORION: Ooh, can I start it and then if we leave I
can have one of the helpers--

774
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:48,061
MATT: You could probably have Allura come and
finish it if you wanted to ask her.

775
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:50,082
ORION: Oh, okay, well. Cool then.

776
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:52,783
MATT: She doesn't have anything better to do.
(laughs)

777
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:55,867
ORION: I'll start that, yeah. I'll start doing
the one that I made.

778
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:59,196
MATT: Okay, getting the enchantment on that. All
right. Go ahead and make your

779
00:42:59,196 --> 00:43:00,543
first tinkering check.

780
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:04,947
TALIESIN: All right. First tinkering roll is 13.

781
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:12,849
MATT: 13. Okay. So as opposed to an actual arrow,
what you're doing is you take an extended crossbow

782
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:20,754
bolt, you blacksmith onto the end of it, extending
it to what would be an actual full-scale longbow

783
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:26,180
arrow length, but it is a thick metal rod. From
there you create the grappling hook end to it and

784
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,163
what would be essentially-- it's thin, and then
once the rope is pulled or tugged from the back,

785
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:36,798
it retracts the front part to extend it into a
grappling hook. You get through the process of

786
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:42,104
creating the rod, and you sketch in a few ideas
for the actual portion of the end of the arrow

787
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:46,850
that would extend into the grappling hook portion.
Go ahead and make a secondary roll.

788
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,069
TALIESIN: 12.

789
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:55,477
MATT: 12? Okay. You're having-- this is including
your tinker bonus, your--

790
00:43:55,477 --> 00:43:57,406
TALIESIN: Just proficiency bonus.

791
00:43:57,406 --> 00:44:07,310
MATT: Yeah. So you started having a little bit of
a problem with the mechanism. It keeps sticking

792
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:13,435
and having a hard time actually retracting or
springing from the arrow point.

793
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,672
TALIESIN: Damn it.

794
00:44:14,672 --> 00:44:17,046
MATT: It takes a little more time than you
anticipated with it. Go ahead and

795
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:18,798
make a final roll.

796
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:25,634
SAM: I'm going to inspire him before he makes this
roll with a little inspiration song or something.

797
00:44:25,634 --> 00:44:29,791
MATT: So Scanlan comes down into your workshop
underneath Greyskull Keep. You hear a fine little

798
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,868
ditty to inspire you in your work.

799
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:42,067
SAM: (sings) Whoa, I hear you're tinkering,
whoa, please do it well. Take my hand and you'll

800
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:44,074
tinker I swear.

801
00:44:44,074 --> 00:44:48,181
ALL: (sing) Whoa! Please do it well.

802
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,949
(laughter)

803
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:51,689
TALIESIN: I feel inspired.

804
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,334
SAM: (sing) Tinkering on a prayer!

805
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:55,184
TALIESIN: There we go. Now I feel inspired.

806
00:44:55,184 --> 00:45:00,551
MATT: I was about to give you a d6, but that'll be
the full d10. So on this final roll, go ahead

807
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:02,470
and-- what did you roll initially?

808
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,736
TALIESIN: I actually don't even remember, but it
wasn't that bad.

809
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:07,305
MATT: All right, go.

810
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:12,528
TALIESIN: All right. So that's 18.

811
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:17,202
MATT: 18, okay. With that bit of inspiration going
in your little Scanlan-based soundtrack--

812
00:45:17,202 --> 00:45:19,502
TALIESIN: (sings) Tinkering on a prayer.

813
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:23,488
MATT: -- you realize that some of the gears that
were sticking, you recut them out, insert it, and

814
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:28,423
like butter (shnk) it sticks out and retracts. So
you have one grappling arrow completed. For

815
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:30,472
material costs, it came to about 100 gold.

816
00:45:30,472 --> 00:45:33,850
TALIESIN: 100 gold. And then I want to try and
recreate the exploding arrow as my last little

817
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,351
thing I want to do today.

818
00:45:35,351 --> 00:45:36,354
MATT: Okay, okay.

819
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:38,293
MARISHA: Guys, we've got to go back and get our
money.

820
00:45:38,293 --> 00:45:40,259
LAURA: Yeah, oh my gosh.

821
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,296
TRAVIS: Yeah, no shit.

822
00:45:41,296 --> 00:45:42,382
ORION: That's what we've got to do.

823
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:44,725
MARISHA: That is like 30k sitting for us in--

824
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:47,956
SAM: Can we just send our minions to get it? Like
our servants.

825
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,640
TRAVIS: Vax has something he'd like to add.

826
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,974
LAURA: What?

827
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:53,779
LIAM: Pike, dear, dear friend, can you hear me?

828
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:55,829
ASHLEY: Oh yes, I know, we're getting to that.

829
00:45:55,829 --> 00:46:01,150
LIAM: I was wondering if maybe you and I could
swing by the temple of Serren-rae and

830
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,171
fix my foot.

831
00:46:03,171 --> 00:46:04,588
TRAVIS and LAURA: Saran Wrap?

832
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:08,172
ASHLEY: Oh, it's Sarenrae, but that's fine.

833
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:13,516
LIAM: I'm three-fourths an atheist, darling, but I
know that my foot doesn't fucking work.

834
00:46:13,678 --> 00:46:19,539
ASHLEY: Well, I know. And I was going to say the
past couple days I think I've spent at the temple

835
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:28,110
trying to sort of reconnect and really just tune
in and apologize and confess.

836
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,689
TALIESIN: Sounds like a day spa.

837
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:31,033
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

838
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:34,057
MATT: And you return to this temple, the same
temple where you yourself were resurrected after

839
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:42,261
falling to the treachery demon naught but eight
months previous. Returning to that place,

840
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:46,538
especially after your recent journey and near
brushes with death again, is a very solemn

841
00:46:46,538 --> 00:46:51,023
experience, and there's a part of you that just
feels internally cold, both returning there and

842
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:55,841
because of your strangely fractured connection
with Sarenrae since you delved into the Underdark

843
00:46:55,841 --> 00:47:03,741
and tapped into your darker side since traveling
abroad on the ship. You take approximately six

844
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:13,452
hours out of each day to just go in silent prayer
and reach out to her. I will say, go ahead and

845
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:16,194
make a wisdom check.

846
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:21,166
ASHLEY: Okay.

847
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:23,182
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

848
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:25,473
ASHLEY: 22.

849
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:31,137
MATT: At the end of your second six-hour period of
intense--

850
00:47:31,137 --> 00:47:32,571
SAM and MARISHA: Six hours!

851
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:34,050
MARISHA: It's like an ayahuasca experience.

852
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,625
SAM: Did you have a bathroom break?

853
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,678
MATT: -- intense communion with Sarenrae, sweat
pouring down your body. The room itself is pretty

854
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:42,619
cold, but for some reason your body is just
growing more and more intense with heat. You feel

855
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:47,684
yourself internalizing all of the steps and
missteps that you've gone through over these past

856
00:47:47,684 --> 00:47:52,686
six or seven months, trying to find your path,
rediscovering yourself and what you have to do to

857
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:55,633
prevent yourself or any of your friends from
falling to the fate that you once did, and

858
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:59,764
explaining to her that your love never left and
that this was all with the ultimate purpose of

859
00:47:59,764 --> 00:48:04,169
achieving her ultimate purpose as her instrument,
and you wish not to cross that again, and if

860
00:48:04,169 --> 00:48:08,652
there's any way to redeem yourself, to let it be
known to you. At the end of that period of time,

861
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:17,415
you feel since you've lost that connection in the
Underdark, that thread reconnect, the warmth fills

862
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:22,910
you, and the sweat stops as your entire body seems
to be humming with energy. For a brief second in

863
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:29,093
your face, in your eyes, in your vision you can
see the beautiful gold, gleaming, fire-wreathed

864
00:48:29,093 --> 00:48:33,253
head of Sarenrae smiling at you as she reaches
down and touches the side of your cheek and says,

865
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:42,648
"Be forthright. Be grand. Burn bright and
beautiful, and I shall always be at your side."

866
00:48:42,648 --> 00:48:48,651
And with that, she releases your cheek and
vanishes, the vision gone in the temple, and you

867
00:48:48,712 --> 00:48:53,081
can see two other clerics that were silent,
muttering prayer, have gone quiet and are both

868
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,796
staring at you with a look of like, 'what just
happened.'

869
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:59,830
LAURA: Yay, Pike, yay!

870
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,091
ASHLEY: Yay, yay, yay!

871
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:03,937
MATT: You look down at your holy symbol, and that
one giant fissure that had cracked

872
00:49:03,937 --> 00:49:05,314
has resealed itself.

873
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:07,769
(all cheer)

874
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:14,450
ASHLEY: Hey man, that was my new special Celtic
die that whoever sent to me.

875
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,359
LAURA: Yep.

876
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,539
LIAM: Celebrate by shitting on a bed.

877
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,095
(all laugh)

878
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:25,015
MATT: It's a cultural gnome thing, right?

879
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:30,188
ASHLEY: So, well, to start things off, then, how
is Liam's foot?

880
00:49:30,188 --> 00:49:31,755
SAM: Whose?

881
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:32,528
MATT: It's going okay.

882
00:49:32,528 --> 00:49:33,427
SAM: Who?

883
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:34,545
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry!

884
00:49:34,545 --> 00:49:35,545
MATT: Who's this Liam guy?

885
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:39,699
ASHLEY: I'm-- what am I saying? I mean, how is
Vax's foot? I'm not sure who Liam is.

886
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:40,771
MATT: As you step out--

887
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,368
LIAM: My foot's great, Ashley, thanks.

888
00:49:42,368 --> 00:49:44,757
(all laugh)

889
00:49:44,911 --> 00:49:50,823
MATT: As you step out of the central chamber of
the temple of Sarenrae, Vax has been waiting there

890
00:49:50,823 --> 00:49:56,476
for a while, wanted to actually ask for your aid
in this. As you see her step out of the main

891
00:49:56,476 --> 00:50:01,640
chamber, Vax, she has a look of serenity in her
face you haven't seen in quite some time.

892
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,258
LIAM: Is this the moment?

893
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:05,295
ASHLEY: Hi.

894
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:08,681
LIAM: Should I take my shoe off? Vex, look, I'll
take my shoe off.

895
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:10,089
LAURA: Don't do it. Don't do it.

896
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:14,408
ASHLEY: Here, just sit on this rock, okay? Take
off your shoe. Hoo.

897
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,467
TALIESIN: For the first time, you're safe.

898
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:17,655
MATT: And he does.

899
00:50:17,655 --> 00:50:19,708
LAURA: Ugh. That's disgusting.

900
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,163
TRAVIS: Proud of you right now.

901
00:50:21,163 --> 00:50:32,969
LIAM: It's still, you know, it feels strong, but
it's-- it itches. It itches me-- It irks me still.

902
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:36,821
Perhaps maybe you could give it one more try
today? You seem to have a bit

903
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:43,207
of a glow about you.

904
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,455
ASHLEY: 30.

905
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:47,198
MATT: That's a 30? 30 points of healing. As you're
saying this and you're stuttering this out, she

906
00:50:47,198 --> 00:50:50,931
goes into a singular trance, clutches her holy
symbol with one hand, and reaches out and grabs

907
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:56,223
your foot with the other. Her hand almost burns at
the touch, something you instinctively pull back

908
00:50:56,223 --> 00:51:01,268
on, but her grip is like an iron vice and you
cannot release yourself from it. And as she just

909
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:05,370
intensely focuses forward, you can see this
glowing divine energy transfer from down her

910
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:09,790
forearm into your foot. Fear reaches you suddenly
because you don't understand the divine, and

911
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:15,841
though you've seen some crazy things, this is a
little worrying. You've seen some shit. I want you

912
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:18,438
to go ahead and make a medicine roll with
advantage.

913
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:19,835
LIAM: It feels like IcyHot!

914
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:21,989
(laughter)

915
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:23,050
TALIESIN: Ye olde IcyHot.

916
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,652
MATT: The scent of Vicks VapoRub hits your
system.

917
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:26,929
LAURA: And another one, you get advantage, you can do
it again.

918
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:29,892
ASHLEY: That's a lot better. 24.

919
00:51:29,946 --> 00:51:37,132
MATT: 24. As she releases her grip on you, the
energy fades, her eyes tend to come back into that

920
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:42,468
natural, soft Pike image you're used to, and
looking down at your foot, you can see any

921
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:48,660
noticeable sign of scarring, damage is completely
gone. Your foot is whole, intact.

922
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,812
(cheering)

923
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:55,559
SAM: And your nails have been painted red. Red
nails.

924
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:57,134
LAURA: Hey, and you know what? It doesn't smell as
bad now.

925
00:51:57,134 --> 00:51:58,702
LIAM: I stick my foot in my sister's face.

926
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,591
LAURA: Yeah, thank you.

927
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:01,932
ORION: I'm going to miss that bit.

928
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:04,277
LAURA: It doesn't even smell bad anymore, so thank
you.

929
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,730
LIAM: Well, not so fast.

930
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,960
MATT: Percy.

931
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,185
TALIESIN: Yes.

932
00:52:10,185 --> 00:52:14,375
MATT: How many-- you have time probably to attempt
three arrows.

933
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,786
TALIESIN: I'm going to try for three exploding
arrows. And I've built one before.

934
00:52:16,786 --> 00:52:19,045
MATT: Yes, you have, I know. I'm still keeping
that in mind.

935
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:20,003
TALIESIN: Thank you.

936
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,755
MATT: Materials per arrow will cost 50 gold.

937
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:23,587
TALIESIN: Another 150 gold? All right.

938
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:24,775
LAURA: I'll give it to you.

939
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,944
MATT: So 150 gold for materials. You have your
goggles on--

940
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:31,919
LAURA: I won't even haggle with you, Percy, I'll
just give it to you. I mean, well, you know. You

941
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,302
know what I mean.

942
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:36,478
TALIESIN: I certainly do. I know exactly what you
mean. No.

943
00:52:36,478 --> 00:52:38,286
LIAM: That's going a bit beyond winking.

944
00:52:38,286 --> 00:52:40,949
LAURA: (laughs) I know.

945
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,545
TALIESIN: Now I'm nervous.

946
00:52:42,545 --> 00:52:45,667
MATT: So coming off the high from making your
grappling arrow, you sit down, you're alone in the

947
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:49,513
middle of your workshop, it's hot in there, it's
subterranean, you have the glow of your

948
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:54,498
candlelight around you, you have your goggles on,
your blacksmith leather gloves on, and you're

949
00:52:54,498 --> 00:53:00,334
tinkering with the delivery method of these small,
concussive arrows. Go ahead and

950
00:53:00,334 --> 00:53:03,593
make your first roll.

951
00:53:03,593 --> 00:53:04,784
TALIESIN: 18.

952
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:12,024
MATT: 18. With deftness, you rapidly complete the
first arrow, wrapping up the powder charge, the

953
00:53:12,024 --> 00:53:19,504
impact point, and the arrow itself weighted to be
fair and balanced to be flung from a longbow. Make

954
00:53:19,504 --> 00:53:20,682
your second roll.

955
00:53:20,682 --> 00:53:22,141
SAM: Like Fox News.

956
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:23,341
TALIESIN: All right. 15.

957
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:27,546
MATT: 15. Second arrow takes a little longer, but
you still manage to keep the flow going, complete

958
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:29,812
it fine. Third and final roll.

959
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:31,013
LAURA: Come on, Percy!

960
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:32,128
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

961
00:53:32,128 --> 00:53:33,656
(cheering)

962
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:35,051
LAURA: That's an extra-special arrow.

963
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:40,884
MATT: Not only did you complete this in record
time, but the arrow itself looks beautiful. It

964
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,943
could be a display case item.

965
00:53:43,943 --> 00:53:46,294
LAURA: Does it do extra damage?

966
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:53,373
MATT: You'll find out. But I would mark that arrow
separately from the other two.

967
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:54,623
TALIESIN: You would mark it.

968
00:53:54,623 --> 00:53:58,504
MATT: Mark it as two exploding arrows and one
exploding arrow with a star next to it.

969
00:53:58,504 --> 00:54:00,805
LAURA: Okay, I'll do that.

970
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:06,905
TALIESIN: So you have a grappling hook arrow, two
exploding arrows, and one exploding arrow

971
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:08,579
with a star.

972
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,140
LAURA: Come here, you beautiful bastard.

973
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:15,580
TALIESIN: I'm getting to kiss everybody in this
game. I've already made my way through siblings,

974
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,176
this is getting-- all right.

975
00:54:17,176 --> 00:54:19,657
MARISHA: That's so true, you have!

976
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,769
MATT: Ah, you've been to that party before.

977
00:54:21,769 --> 00:54:24,109
TALIESIN: I've kissed the twins. I have, well,
thank you.

978
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:28,190
MATT: All right, any other business you guys wish
to--

979
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:31,895
TRAVIS: Yeah, is there a tavern nearby? Just a
quick question.

980
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:35,287
MATT: There are many taverns. The one you know the
best is the Laughing Lamia, which you guys

981
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:36,575
previously stayed at.

982
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,001
TRAVIS: It's the biggest one?

983
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:39,502
MATT: It's pretty large, it's pretty large.

984
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:44,839
TRAVIS: I'd like to walk to the Laughing Lamia and
knock the doors open and as loud as I can, go,

985
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:51,716
Listen up! I want to know if anyone has seen any
goliaths wandering around these parts.

986
00:54:51,716 --> 00:54:54,801
Aside from me.

987
00:54:54,801 --> 00:55:01,290
MATT: Do you wish to do this via conversational
persuasion or through intimidation? Because there

988
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,602
are two ways you can go with this, Grog.

989
00:55:03,793 --> 00:55:06,067
LAURA: And you're wearing the belt that makes you
extra persuasive.

990
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:07,388
MARISHA: Only with dwarves.

991
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:10,132
TRAVIS: Persuasive... yeah, well, maybe there's
some dwarves hanging about.

992
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:11,480
MARISHA: There might be some dwarves!

993
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,380
MATT: So how are you doing this? Okay, make a
persuasion roll.

994
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,169
SAM: Can I be with him just to watch?

995
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:17,209
LAURA: Was there also a grappling arrow, Percy?

996
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:18,084
MATT: Sure.

997
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:20,104
SAM: Okay, I'm with you, Grog, just watching.

998
00:55:20,104 --> 00:55:21,390
ORION: I'm still enchanting.

999
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,021
TALIESIN: Possibly reusable.

1000
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:23,984
LAURA: Ooh.

1001
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:25,260
LIAM: Yeah you are.

1002
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,042
MARISHA: Can I go read my potion book?

1003
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:30,339
TRAVIS: I got a four. With the belt.

1004
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:34,347
(laughter)

1005
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:35,658
MATT: This is.

1006
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:37,350
MARISHA: What dice are you rolling?

1007
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,122
TRAVIS: I grow a giant pubic mane from the belt.

1008
00:55:41,122 --> 00:55:43,881
MATT: Enchanted merkin plus two.

1009
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:46,056
ORION: Dude. You've got to check your balanced
dice, man.

1010
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:50,388
MATT: All right. So as you burst in and shout this
to the group, everyone stops and turns and

1011
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:55,650
looks... and then goes right back to drinking and
their conversation. There appears to be no

1012
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,825
immediate reaction.

1013
00:55:56,825 --> 00:56:01,487
SAM: Can I jump up-- I jump up on a table and I
say, Listen, you motherfuckers, my friend just asked

1014
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:05,698
you a fucking question, now fucking answer him or
I'm going to kill every last

1015
00:56:05,749 --> 00:56:07,498
motherfucking one of you!

1016
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:09,641
TRAVIS: I'd listen to him, he means it.

1017
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:11,649
LAURA: Can you do that?

1018
00:56:11,649 --> 00:56:12,577
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1019
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,417
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

1020
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:15,487
SAM: Is this a 20?

1021
00:56:15,487 --> 00:56:16,540
ASHLEY: Come on, Scanlan.

1022
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,545
LAURA: Please be good.

1023
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:18,581
ASHLEY: Come on, Scanlan.

1024
00:56:18,581 --> 00:56:20,132
SAM: I rolled, that would be a 30.

1025
00:56:20,132 --> 00:56:24,275
TRAVIS: Thug life. That's amazing!

1026
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:27,124
SAM: Oh wait, no. Yes, 28. I added wrong. 28.

1027
00:56:27,124 --> 00:56:35,185
MATT: Oh, well that makes the difference. So in an
unseen display, the goliath storms into the bar

1028
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:39,978
and makes no impact, yet the tiniest gnome jumps
onto the table like a ravenous wolverine, frothing

1029
00:56:39,978 --> 00:56:44,940
at the mouth, his wild eyes staring about the dark
interior of the Laughing Lamia. All the patrons at

1030
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:51,289
the table around him, you can see, lean back in
fear, caught off-guard by this entirely, one man

1031
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:56,741
holding a drink just drops it and you hear it
shatter on the ground. Everyone gets quiet again,

1032
00:56:56,741 --> 00:57:00,471
but stays quiet. Even the small band playing in
the far corner, you hear like (gee-uh), a

1033
00:57:00,471 --> 00:57:04,905
discordant sound as all instruments break to a
halt, the dancer stops, the whole room is

1034
00:57:04,905 --> 00:57:11,700
dead-silent. At which point a nearby halfling, you
can see he's unkempt, farmer-tan looking fellow,

1035
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:18,339
looks up and he goes, "Um. No...?"

1036
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:23,784
SAM: Thank you for your forthrightness and
honesty.

1037
00:57:23,784 --> 00:57:30,185
MATT: At which point a hand claps your shoulder.
You look over and there's a human there, a bearded

1038
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:36,757
older man in his 40s, his hair trimmed very very
short, crew-cut almost. He's wearing what looks

1039
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:40,643
like a patchwork scalemail almost, like mostly
leather but there's a lot of chunks of scales put

1040
00:57:40,643 --> 00:57:47,876
around it and he looks scarred and weathered and
he says, "I've traveled this land quite a bit and

1041
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:53,971
"I've heard there's roving bands of goliaths been
attacking folks up north in trade routes. Haven't

1042
00:57:53,971 --> 00:58:01,158
"seen any near Emon. Where occasionally you'd hear of
the mountain-folks staying up north, it appears

1043
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:06,908
"they're getting brazen, wandering southward.
Haven't seen them myself, but a friend of mine had

1044
00:58:07,074 --> 00:58:12,300
"an encounter once. Lost half his traveling crew.
Had to bury them out there. It was terrible."

1045
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,870
SAM: Sounds awful. You said up north, how far?

1046
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:22,805
MATT: "Just in the Silvercoat Runway. The way
south of Kraghammer, on the way to Westruun."

1047
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:26,040
SAM: All right. Anything else you'd like to know,
Grog?

1048
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,926
TRAVIS: No, Killer.

1049
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:31,518
SAM: Thank you for your troubles. Here, let me buy
you a drink.

1050
00:58:31,518 --> 00:58:36,617
MATT: "All right, I'll take that." And he goes
over, walks with you to the bar, toss him a gold,

1051
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:44,862
he gets his ale, and, "You know, I've always shat
on gnomes, but today I think you've represented

1052
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:46,065
"them well."

1053
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,227
SAM: You, my friend, have good taste.

1054
00:58:48,227 --> 00:58:51,530
TRAVIS: That was awesome.

1055
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,981
I had no idea. That was amazing, Scanlan.

1056
00:58:56,033 --> 00:59:00,960
SAM: For you, anything. Hey, grow a beard tomorrow
morning.

1057
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,150
TRAVIS: Okay.

1058
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:11,015
MATT: All right, so. We'll say over the period of
two days go by-- Grog,

1059
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,830
what's the percentage on your--

1060
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,718
TRAVIS: 50% chance.

1061
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,826
MATT: Go ahead and roll a percentile dice.

1062
00:59:16,826 --> 00:59:18,352
SAM: Oh, we've never done one of those before.

1063
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:19,326
LAURA: Oh, percentile dice!

1064
00:59:19,326 --> 00:59:20,201
TRAVIS: That a 20?

1065
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:21,149
LAURA: No, a percentile dice.

1066
00:59:21,149 --> 00:59:22,095
SAM: No, it's a percentile dice.

1067
00:59:22,095 --> 00:59:24,252
MATT: It's two ten-siders. There should be one
that has double-digits and one that has single.

1068
00:59:24,252 --> 00:59:26,523
TRAVIS: Both of them?

1069
00:59:26,523 --> 00:59:27,361
MATT: Yeah.

1070
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:28,363
SAM: No, just one.

1071
00:59:28,363 --> 00:59:30,618
TRAVIS: 60?

1072
00:59:30,618 --> 00:59:32,057
MATT: 60, then roll another one.

1073
00:59:32,057 --> 00:59:33,086
SAM: Oh.

1074
00:59:33,086 --> 00:59:36,713
TRAVIS: Double zeroes.

1075
00:59:36,713 --> 00:59:39,042
LAURA: 100, that's a 100.

1076
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:43,761
MATT: Right, well that was a 60 and then that was
for the second digit, so you rolled a 60.

1077
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:44,928
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

1078
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:49,778
MATT: All right, so, over the period of the next
morning you wake up excited and check... smooth as

1079
00:59:49,778 --> 00:59:50,973
a baby's bum.

1080
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:52,859
TRAVIS: Shit.

1081
00:59:52,859 --> 01:00:00,060
MATT: However, as the two-day period comes to an
end, you guys acquire, early in the morning that

1082
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:07,024
morning as you finish your breakfast, a messenger
comes to the front of Greyskull Keep and delivers

1083
01:00:07,094 --> 01:00:11,659
a summons to the Council of Tal'Dorei that
notifies you that the package has arrived at the

1084
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:18,313
Council. Very very quick, to the point words, not
very verbose, in the idea of keeping it vague and

1085
01:00:18,313 --> 01:00:19,806
secret, but you know what it means.

1086
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:21,700
SAM: Do you think it's the model plane I ordered?

1087
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,044
LAURA: I think it is, yes.

1088
01:00:23,044 --> 01:00:24,359
TRAVIS: Probably not.

1089
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:25,602
SAM: Oh.

1090
01:00:25,602 --> 01:00:27,062
TRAVIS: Just a guess, though.

1091
01:00:27,062 --> 01:00:29,460
LAURA: Well, should we go?

1092
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:33,026
MATT: So mark down that you spent two of four days
of enchanting on that second earring, and you can

1093
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:37,940
get back to that if you manage to find yourself to
some sort of a laboratory elsewhere, or you can

1094
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,481
return to your--

1095
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:44,447
ORION: Can we stop at-- is Allura, is she here or
not?

1096
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:45,641
TRAVIS: Allura?

1097
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:49,161
MATT: Allura? She might be in the Cloudtop
District in her tower. You can inquire.

1098
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:52,950
ORION: And do we-- does she have helpers there,
when we were there, do you remember?

1099
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,132
MATT: No, she was just herself.

1100
01:00:54,132 --> 01:00:55,068
ORION: It was just herself?

1101
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,362
MATT: She runs it herself.

1102
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:57,439
ORION: Okay.

1103
01:00:57,439 --> 01:01:00,877
SAM: In the last two days, have I gone back to
Gilmore to pick up my item?

1104
01:01:00,877 --> 01:01:02,837
MATT: You got back, your item was completed.

1105
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:04,000
SAM: Excellent.

1106
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,930
ASHLEY: What kind of potion did you get?

1107
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:16,309
SAM: It's a potion that, when combined with-- when
consumed, can allow me to leave a mark of some

1108
01:01:16,364 --> 01:01:27,865
sort that possibly I could use to have visions of
what is in the area. The mechanics of which I

1109
01:01:27,865 --> 01:01:30,948
would not like to get into at this moment.

1110
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:36,283
MATT: So he gives you the potion. "It was a
curious endeavor, but I think you'll be happy with

1111
01:01:36,283 --> 01:01:37,422
"the results."

1112
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:38,771
LAURA: It's so he can spy on you.

1113
01:01:38,771 --> 01:01:41,265
SAM: Any chance to talk to you, Gilmore, leaves me
happy beyond compare.

1114
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,019
MATT: "Oh, stop it, flattery will get you
everywhere."

1115
01:01:44,019 --> 01:01:46,744
TRAVIS: If you have an erection for more than 24
hours...

1116
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:52,480
LAURA: Did you get that potion so you can spy on
Pike when she's naked?

1117
01:01:52,480 --> 01:02:00,485
SAM: I am offended, and terrified at the
assumption that I would sink so low!

1118
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:01,739
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

1119
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:14,671
SAM: As to spy on my good friend and future wife
Pike when her pantaloons are down. Not at all. How

1120
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:22,077
dare you. How dare you! Have I ever spied?

1121
01:02:22,077 --> 01:02:23,022
LAURA: Yes.

1122
01:02:23,022 --> 01:02:24,730
SAM: On a member of our current party?

1123
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,756
LAURA: Yes, you have.

1124
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:26,530
ASHLEY: Yes.

1125
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,277
ORION: No.

1126
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:28,094
SAM: Current party.

1127
01:02:28,094 --> 01:02:29,306
LAURA: Yes.

1128
01:02:29,306 --> 01:02:30,591
SAM: Okay. Okay.

1129
01:02:30,591 --> 01:02:32,016
(laughter)

1130
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:37,254
TRAVIS: Tiberius, can you bamf us to the place?

1131
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,795
SAM: I just wanted to make sure you remembered.

1132
01:02:38,795 --> 01:02:39,740
LAURA: Good, I do.

1133
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:44,991
ORION: It doesn't work like that. I can bamf us
back here when we're done.

1134
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,947
MATT: All right, so you've acquired your potion,
it's a brackish purple color; it's a purple-grey.

1135
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:53,371
SAM: Purple-grey. Okay. I've got it. Great, thank
you.

1136
01:02:53,371 --> 01:03:00,266
MATT: You go back to Karin and indeed the armor is
completed. It's interesting, it makes Trinket look

1137
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:01,661
like a roly-poly, almost.

1138
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:03,150
ALL: Ooh!

1139
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,296
LAURA: Oh, that's so cute!

1140
01:03:04,296 --> 01:03:10,755
MATT: It's these overlaid giant grey scales that
overlap in armored sections and you would imagine,

1141
01:03:10,806 --> 01:03:14,634
if you wanted-- could roll in a ball and she would
look adorable. He would. But yeah,

1142
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:16,022
it's, the armor--

1143
01:03:16,022 --> 01:03:18,070
LAURA: You really, really want Trinket to be a
girl.

1144
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:23,564
MATT: I don't know why I've got it in my head, I
don't. You know what it is? It's because my bird I

1145
01:03:23,564 --> 01:03:26,083
thought was a boy for the longest time, and we
found out the bird was a girl, and so I got used

1146
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,829
to transitioning to she when I talk about animals
since then. I apologize.

1147
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:30,206
LAURA: Oh, I see. Understandable.

1148
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:31,222
MATT: Trinket is a boy.

1149
01:03:31,222 --> 01:03:35,618
LAURA: Boy. And maybe he could roll into things
now! It'll be awesome.

1150
01:03:35,618 --> 01:03:36,756
MARISHA: Yeah, can he roll?

1151
01:03:36,756 --> 01:03:38,387
MATT: We'll try it if you want to?

1152
01:03:38,387 --> 01:03:40,333
MARISHA: Roly-poly bear.

1153
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,127
MATT: Bears aren't known for their rolling
capabilities.

1154
01:03:42,127 --> 01:03:43,765
LAURA: Trinket is a special bear.

1155
01:03:43,765 --> 01:03:47,858
ORION: How much does Trinket weigh again? Like 600
pounds?

1156
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:49,230
LAURA: He weighs a lot.

1157
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,287
TALIESIN: Call it a "bear-rel" roll.

1158
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:56,592
ORION: He's not over a thousand pounds though. Is it
800 pounds?

1159
01:03:56,592 --> 01:03:58,852
MATT: Trinket's pushing about 800 pounds,
probably.

1160
01:03:58,852 --> 01:04:00,270
ORION: He's 800 pounds, so.

1161
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,493
LAURA: He weighs more than Grog.

1162
01:04:01,493 --> 01:04:03,238
ORION: I can fastball special him.

1163
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:05,937
LAURA: (gasps) Fastball special Trinket.

1164
01:04:05,937 --> 01:04:14,177
MATT: So the benefits of this. Trinket acquires an
additional plus two to Trinket's armor class over

1165
01:04:14,261 --> 01:04:17,285
his previous armor, which he gains from the
bulette.

1166
01:04:17,285 --> 01:04:18,928
LAURA: That puts him at 20.

1167
01:04:18,928 --> 01:04:30,225
MATT: That's fantastic. Also, Trinket has
resistance against non-magical bludgeoning

1168
01:04:30,225 --> 01:04:31,504
damage.

1169
01:04:31,504 --> 01:04:34,035
LAURA: Awesome.

1170
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:37,705
MATT: So if anyone attempts to go after Trinket
with a giant hammer or you know something that is

1171
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:38,725
bludgeon-type damage--

1172
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:39,900
ORION: Or a mace.

1173
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,711
MATT: -- or a giant mace, anything. If I ever
attack Trinket with something that seems

1174
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,819
bludgeoning and you say, ah-ah, is that
bludgeoning? Call me on it and it could be reduced

1175
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:47,027
by half.

1176
01:04:47,027 --> 01:04:48,136
SAM: What if someone tries to--

1177
01:04:48,136 --> 01:04:49,910
LAURA: So if I did try to roll him into something
it wouldn't hurt him--

1178
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:50,976
MATT: Not as much.

1179
01:04:50,976 --> 01:04:52,564
LAURA: -- because that would technically be
bludgeoning.

1180
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:53,762
MATT: In theory, yeah.

1181
01:04:53,835 --> 01:04:54,596
LAURA: Okay.

1182
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:55,821
MATT: Hitting the wall, Trinket would be like,
"All right."

1183
01:04:55,821 --> 01:04:57,587
SAM: What if someone tried to hit Trinket with a
salmon?

1184
01:04:57,587 --> 01:04:58,756
ORION: That's also bludgeoning.

1185
01:04:58,756 --> 01:05:04,108
MATT: That's fish damage, it's a different arcane
type of damage. Fire, lightning, fish, it's a

1186
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,320
whole thing.

1187
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,368
LAURA: Let's go see the Council.

1188
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,508
SAM: Let's go. All right. To the Council!

1189
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,460
MARISHA: Did I learn anything from my herbalism
book?

1190
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:21,461
MATT: What the books are is you keep them with
you, and if you wish to reference them while

1191
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:26,709
taking any sort of herbalism roll, they will
essentially give you a momentary bonus to it. They

1192
01:05:26,709 --> 01:05:31,222
will double your proficiency bonus for any rolls
for herbalism or to harvest

1193
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:33,002
any pieces of a creature.

1194
01:05:33,002 --> 01:05:34,081
MARISHA: Dope.

1195
01:05:34,081 --> 01:05:35,827
MATT: So keep that in mind.

1196
01:05:35,827 --> 01:05:36,950
TRAVIS: Dope.

1197
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:37,996
MARISHA: Dope.

1198
01:05:37,996 --> 01:05:39,978
SAM: All right.

1199
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,287
TRAVIS: So let's go.

1200
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:42,553
SAM: Let's go to the Council.

1201
01:05:42,553 --> 01:05:44,169
MATT: Are you proficient in herbalism?

1202
01:05:44,169 --> 01:05:44,989
MARISHA: Huh?

1203
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:49,669
MATT: Are you proficient in herbalism? Or medicine
I guess it would be now, sorry. Herbalism is,

1204
01:05:49,669 --> 01:05:51,902
sorry, that's old systems.

1205
01:05:51,902 --> 01:05:53,821
MARISHA: I mean, I'm proficient in nature.

1206
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:59,927
MATT: We'll say nature, it'd be nature. I've run
too many systems. Too many games. So we'll say,

1207
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:01,727
are you proficient in nature?

1208
01:06:01,727 --> 01:06:03,199
MARISHA: Yeah. Druid, yo.

1209
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,516
MATT: So you double your proficiency bonus on any
nature rolls to do either of those things.

1210
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:07,637
MARISHA: Okay.

1211
01:06:07,637 --> 01:06:12,311
MATT: Keep that in mind. All right. So. You guys
head to the Cloudtop District towards the palace

1212
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:16,392
in the center. You were about to say something,
Orion?

1213
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:18,238
ORION: Nope.

1214
01:06:18,238 --> 01:06:20,237
MATT: Do you want to talk to Allura while you're
here, or not?

1215
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:23,860
ORION: No.

1216
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,457
MATT: Okay.

1217
01:06:25,457 --> 01:06:28,402
LIAM: You should talk to her. Talk to her.

1218
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:30,623
ORION: She has no interest in me.

1219
01:06:30,623 --> 01:06:32,339
LAURA: She looks really pretty today, Tiberius.

1220
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:34,109
TRAVIS: She won't have any interest if you don't
talk to her.

1221
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:35,966
ASHLEY: It looks like she put some lip stuff on.

1222
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:39,039
ORION: I'm sure Lady Kima can satisfy any needs
she has.

1223
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,151
LAURA: I think they're just friends, darling.

1224
01:06:42,151 --> 01:06:45,488
LIAM: You don't want to look back and regret what
you didn't say.

1225
01:06:45,488 --> 01:06:49,779
TRAVIS: (sings) Say what you need to say.

1226
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:52,380
ASHLEY: (sings) Say what you need to say.

1227
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,917
TALIESIN: Listen to the tiny disembodied head.

1228
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:54,933
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

1229
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:56,330
ORION: We can stop by there, okay. I only have a
question.

1230
01:06:56,330 --> 01:07:00,439
MATT: It's nearly across the street from the
palace. So you head to the ivory tower, you go

1231
01:07:00,439 --> 01:07:04,471
ahead and you take the giant circular knocker on
the door, hit it a couple times, eventually Allura

1232
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:09,290
comes, this time in what looks like more
comfortable robes. She was caught off-guard. She

1233
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:16,266
has like a terry cloth or some sort of big fuzzy
material, her hair's a bit in disarray. She opens

1234
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:22,214
the door. "Oh. Hello. Greetings, I'm sorry, I
wasn't expecting company."

1235
01:07:22,214 --> 01:07:23,915
MARISHA: What time is it?

1236
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:29,022
MATT: At this point in time it's probably about,
I'd say, 11 in the morning.

1237
01:07:29,022 --> 01:07:30,623
LAURA: Oh, she's a late sleeper, I like it.

1238
01:07:30,623 --> 01:07:32,094
MARISHA: On like a Sunday?

1239
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:33,344
MATT: Sure.

1240
01:07:33,344 --> 01:07:34,597
MARISHA: Roughly.

1241
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:35,941
MATT: Roughly, yeah.

1242
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:36,962
MARISHA: Okay.

1243
01:07:36,962 --> 01:07:47,275
ORION: We were about to depart on another
adventure and whatnot, and I was working on an

1244
01:07:47,275 --> 01:07:50,661
enchantment on this particular-- I'll show her
what it is.

1245
01:07:50,661 --> 01:07:52,405
MATT: "Oh yes, yes, of course."

1246
01:07:52,405 --> 01:07:57,633
ORION: It's an enchantment that's easily, you
know, finished enough. I was wondering if in our

1247
01:07:57,633 --> 01:08:02,487
absence, in your spare time you could probably put
some time into finishing the enchantment whilst

1248
01:08:02,487 --> 01:08:04,356
we're away.

1249
01:08:04,356 --> 01:08:10,606
MATT: "That should not be a problem. I was
intending to complete the circle of teleportation

1250
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:14,038
"markings that I had promised you for your Keep in
your absence. So."

1251
01:08:14,038 --> 01:08:16,538
ORION: Oh! Just waiting there as well.

1252
01:08:16,538 --> 01:08:18,073
MATT: "I could do both while I'm there."

1253
01:08:18,073 --> 01:08:19,274
ORION: Thank you so much, Allura.

1254
01:08:19,274 --> 01:08:20,436
MATT: "It would be my pleasure, Tiberius."

1255
01:08:20,436 --> 01:08:32,240
ORION: It is-- (sputtering) Well. Okay. I'll bid
you farewell. And I'll do Prestidigitation

1256
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:39,960
(pfft)-- a local flower, I'll give to her. For
your trouble.

1257
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,905
MATT: A purple dandy, as it's called, it's like a
star-like purple flower, projects itself from your

1258
01:08:45,905 --> 01:08:53,436
hand. You hand it to her and you see she puts her
hand in her face a second. "Thank you very much,

1259
01:08:53,436 --> 01:08:55,101
"Tiberius, I appreciate it."

1260
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:56,675
ORION: You're welcome.

1261
01:08:56,675 --> 01:09:01,316
MATT: She touches your shoulder, gives you a
smile, and then, "Best of luck. Return safely.

1262
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:07,247
"There is-- you've been here too short to leave so
soon, so don't stay long, please."

1263
01:09:07,411 --> 01:09:11,883
Closes the door.

1264
01:09:11,883 --> 01:09:14,887
LAURA: I shake his shoulders. Look at you!

1265
01:09:14,887 --> 01:09:16,485
ORION: Who knew?

1266
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:20,372
LIAM: Do you want to go steady, if so check this.

1267
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:21,996
(laughter)

1268
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:24,545
ORION: Do you like me, yes, no, maybe.

1269
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:28,289
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the
palace, back to the Council chambers where you met

1270
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:33,963
naught but two days before. The entire Council has
not been summoned to this, it's just about half of

1271
01:09:33,963 --> 01:09:40,343
the folks there. You see the actual sovereign
Uriel is not present. The individuals that are

1272
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:51,411
there, however, Tofor Brotorus, the female
dragonborn paladin, is present. Seeker Asum Emring

1273
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:57,528
is present. They are both in the room, and you
notice this immediately as you walk into the green

1274
01:09:57,528 --> 01:10:08,697
meeting chamber: there are two envoys that you
haven't previously met, two humans, one male and

1275
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:13,240
one female, dressed in silver and blue robes,
waiting patiently with their hands behind their

1276
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:20,445
backs, and beside them on the ground you see what
looks like a large cube about maybe two feet by

1277
01:10:20,445 --> 01:10:29,128
two feet. It's smooth, like a chrome-like silver,
the entire construct of the cube, with two

1278
01:10:29,128 --> 01:10:36,958
chain-link handles on each side of the box. There
is a very finely carved sapphire-inlaid patterned

1279
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:42,807
design all over this box. It looks very ornamental
and like it was a painstaking process to craft.

1280
01:10:42,807 --> 01:10:50,879
You gather immediately that this probably is the
container which was sent for from Vasselheim.

1281
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:56,393
As you get closer, you notice the carvings almost
have a snowflake-like pattern, it's very geometric

1282
01:10:56,393 --> 01:11:02,466
and perpetual, almost a fractal that continues
throughout the entirety of the outside of the box.

1283
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:09,978
It's very intricate and beautiful. As you step
into the room, immediately Tofor stands up and

1284
01:11:10,144 --> 01:11:18,083
says, "Ah. They have arrived. Good. I'm glad you
all could make it. The envoys have arrived with

1285
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:27,830
"the container for the Horn. I believe they are
eager and ready to take you as their guards to see

1286
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:34,711
"that this evil is rid of this land forever.
Envoys." And she extends her hand.

1287
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:44,117
They both step forward. The man, young but very
soft in voice and very stern and military almost.

1288
01:11:44,117 --> 01:11:53,008
"Hello. I am Scalebearer Vorak. I come under the
Platinum Dragon and will be escorted along with

1289
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:56,413
"you and our delivery."

1290
01:11:56,413 --> 01:12:04,452
As he turns to the female who steps forward, she's
older, probably in her forties, long fine hair,

1291
01:12:04,452 --> 01:12:11,127
brown, that rests just past her shoulders. Her
features are very very fine, you can see almost

1292
01:12:11,287 --> 01:12:15,461
like there is elven blood in her but not
completely, similar to your half-elf compatriots.

1293
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:20,764
She steps forward, her piercing green eyes hit the
group immediately and she goes, "Hello. I am

1294
01:12:20,764 --> 01:12:27,536
"Scalebearer Desona, also under the Platinum Dragon
and will be escorting you on this mission." They

1295
01:12:27,536 --> 01:12:34,471
both step back towards the box in a very
ceremonial way. Everyone looks to the rest of you.

1296
01:12:34,471 --> 01:12:40,076
SAM: Hi, nice to meet you.

1297
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:42,797
LAURA: I'm sorry, I was writing down your name,
Desona, what?

1298
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:44,187
SAM: Was it Vorak and Desona?

1299
01:12:44,187 --> 01:12:45,410
LAURA: Desona.

1300
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,331
ORION: Hello.

1301
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:48,723
SAM: Lovely to meet you. I'm Scanlan, I'm sort of
the de facto leader of the group.

1302
01:12:48,723 --> 01:12:52,276
ORION: That is not true. I am Tiberius Stormwind,
hello, nice to meet you.

1303
01:12:52,276 --> 01:12:53,460
SAM: My second.

1304
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:59,214
TRAVIS: Everyone introduce yourself.

1305
01:12:59,214 --> 01:13:04,938
TALIESIN: Oh. Percival Fredrickstein Klossowski
von Mussel de Rolo III. At your service.

1306
01:13:04,938 --> 01:13:06,196
ORION, LAURA AND TRAVIS: You can call him
Percy.

1307
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:07,476
TALIESIN: They call me Percy.

1308
01:13:07,476 --> 01:13:09,157
MATT: They look about the rest of the group.

1309
01:13:09,157 --> 01:13:10,204
LAURA: Hello.

1310
01:13:10,204 --> 01:13:16,200
SAM: Hi. And you'll be accompanying us on this
arduous journey to the nor-- where are we going?

1311
01:13:16,378 --> 01:13:20,559
MATT: "Vasselheim, to the northwest, in the region
of Othanzia."

1312
01:13:20,559 --> 01:13:22,163
LAURA: Oh, yes.

1313
01:13:22,163 --> 01:13:26,381
MATT: "On the continent of Isilra. It's quite a
ways."

1314
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:28,643
LAURA: Are we taking a skyship?

1315
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:30,026
SAM: We're taking an airship of some sort.

1316
01:13:30,026 --> 01:13:32,084
MATT: "Yes, a skyship is to be provided."

1317
01:13:32,084 --> 01:13:37,871
They look at the Council, and the Council nods to
themselves and you can see Seeker Emring steps

1318
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:42,234
forward. "Yes, yes, a skyship will be provided,
waiting for you at the skyport here in the

1319
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:47,860
"Cloudtop District. We're just awaiting one more."
As he says that, the door opens again, and you can

1320
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:53,157
see Lady Kima steps in. No longer in the gold
armor that she had found-- scavenged from the

1321
01:13:53,157 --> 01:13:59,368
interior, she's now dressed in proper silver and
blue inlaid plate mail.

1322
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,572
MARISHA: Who is this?

1323
01:14:00,572 --> 01:14:01,380
LAURA: Lady Kima!

1324
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,301
MARISHA: Kima.

1325
01:14:02,301 --> 01:14:07,987
MATT: She is wearing the same colors as the two
envoys, you can see now the silver and blue theme

1326
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:15,235
of Bahamut is very much on display in this
traveling crew. "Sorry I'm late, had to get

1327
01:14:15,235 --> 01:14:16,570
"ready."

1328
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,050
LAURA: You look wonderful, Lady Kima.

1329
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,825
TRAVIS: Yeah, you look wonderful, Lady Kima.

1330
01:14:20,825 --> 01:14:22,431
MATT: "Thank you, thank you."

1331
01:14:22,431 --> 01:14:23,755
TALIESIN: Quite, quite.

1332
01:14:23,755 --> 01:14:29,078
MATT: "Well, I. Do we have--" She looks about the
rest of the group with a look of somewhat kind

1333
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:32,798
of-- "Do we have the artifact?"

1334
01:14:32,798 --> 01:14:34,300
LAURA: Oh.

1335
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,764
SAM: Were we supposed to bring that?

1336
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:37,069
TRAVIS: I have it.

1337
01:14:37,069 --> 01:14:43,956
MATT: The two Scalebearers reach over and both at
the same time place their hands on the top of this

1338
01:14:43,956 --> 01:14:49,284
chest. You can see their fingers slip into these
small holes on the sides and they lift, and the

1339
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:54,983
box scrapes with this high-pitched
metal-against-metal scraping sound, opening up a

1340
01:14:54,983 --> 01:15:01,555
chamber on the inside. You can see the interior
also has the same similar scrolling carvings and

1341
01:15:01,555 --> 01:15:08,201
engraving on the inside of the box that you saw on
the outside. There is a slight hum almost, like a

1342
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:13,378
slight vibrational sound coming from the inside of
the box. Kima looks to you guys expectantly.

1343
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:16,698
"Shall we place the artifact in its container?"

1344
01:15:16,698 --> 01:15:17,893
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll get it. I reach in--

1345
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:19,577
LAURA: No no no, Grog Grog Grog. No.

1346
01:15:19,577 --> 01:15:21,438
TALIESIN: No no no no. Tiberius, if you would be
so kind.

1347
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:22,391
LAURA: Mage Hand?

1348
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:25,872
ORION: Oh, yeah. I'll hold the thing up?

1349
01:15:25,872 --> 01:15:26,654
TALIESIN: Yes.

1350
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:27,758
LAURA: We're putting it in the box, yeah?

1351
01:15:27,758 --> 01:15:28,654
TALIESIN: Putting it in the box.

1352
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:29,838
ORION: Oh!

1353
01:15:29,838 --> 01:15:38,396
MATT: So it takes a moment. The use of Mage Hand
in a Bag of Holding is a very meticulous process,

1354
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:42,347
because the Bag of Holding responds to the thought
command of what you're reaching for the moment you

1355
01:15:42,347 --> 01:15:46,854
reach in with your physical hand. Using it as an
arcane tether it's almost like reaching through

1356
01:15:47,003 --> 01:15:52,427
jello to get there, so you have to really
concentrate to get it through. Eventually the Mage

1357
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:56,619
Hand takes hold of something. You feel the
tingling of something weighty in the grasp of your

1358
01:15:56,619 --> 01:16:05,005
arcane focus and as you lift out, there aloft you
can see the dark, twisted Horn of Orcus. As it's

1359
01:16:05,005 --> 01:16:09,436
removed, this is the first time the Council's
really seen it at this point, and there's an

1360
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:13,734
audible leaving of breath in the room,
everyone at its presence.

1361
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:15,497
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty horrible.

1362
01:16:15,497 --> 01:16:16,399
ORION: Okay.

1363
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:18,060
TRAVIS: What?

1364
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:22,318
ORION: Hold on a second. We're putting this in the
container, right?

1365
01:16:22,318 --> 01:16:23,743
TRAVIS: Yeah, the box, the magic box.

1366
01:16:23,864 --> 01:16:24,699
LAURA: Yes.

1367
01:16:24,699 --> 01:16:26,373
ORION: I put it inside the Bag of Holding real
quick.

1368
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,599
LAURA: Back in the Bag of Holding?

1369
01:16:27,599 --> 01:16:36,559
ORION: Yes. I'm going to take off a tiny piece of
one of my tickets of Telescription, and I'm going

1370
01:16:36,612 --> 01:16:45,607
to enchant it and I want to attempt to do an
enchantment spell where-- I want to put it at the

1371
01:16:45,607 --> 01:16:47,425
bottom of where I'm going to--

1372
01:16:47,425 --> 01:16:48,352
LAURA: The box?

1373
01:16:48,352 --> 01:16:57,363
ORION: -- the box, and if it's, if any weight is
lifted from it, I'll know. Like, if there's the

1374
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:59,916
old switcheroo somehow--

1375
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:02,489
LIAM: God, I so wish we still had the troll dick
right now.

1376
01:17:02,489 --> 01:17:05,436
ORION: Oh man. Because I would've used the troll
dick instead.

1377
01:17:05,436 --> 01:17:12,930
MATT: It is already enchanted. To re-enchant it is
a difficult process, plus enchanting anything

1378
01:17:13,159 --> 01:17:16,182
would take time. It's essentially an Alarm spell,
you could do it, but it would take

1379
01:17:16,182 --> 01:17:17,498
probably half a day.

1380
01:17:17,498 --> 01:17:18,515
TRAVIS: I think we can trust them.

1381
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:19,645
ORION: Okay.

1382
01:17:19,645 --> 01:17:23,350
LAURA: Plus adding extra runes in there might jack
up the enchantment they already put in the box.

1383
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,127
ORION: It's a tiny piece of paper.

1384
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:27,172
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we're good.

1385
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:29,707
ORION: But fine, if I can't do it then, I just
wanted to say.

1386
01:17:29,707 --> 01:17:30,670
MATT: Right, it's fine.

1387
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:31,436
ORION: I put it in there.

1388
01:17:31,436 --> 01:17:33,122
ASHLEY: That was a good idea.

1389
01:17:33,122 --> 01:17:36,245
MATT: I mean, if you had an Alarm spell at your
disposal too, that would be what the enchantment's

1390
01:17:36,245 --> 01:17:38,049
based. I don't know if you learned Alarm, did
you?

1391
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:39,437
ORION: Not yet.

1392
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:40,349
MATT: Yeah. So.

1393
01:17:40,349 --> 01:17:41,222
ORION: It's okay.

1394
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:42,143
MATT: That'd be a little different.

1395
01:17:42,143 --> 01:17:43,321
ORION: So I put it in the thing.

1396
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:48,900
MATT: Okay. As the Horn gets lowered into it, you
can see the runes on the inside of the box begin

1397
01:17:48,954 --> 01:17:57,485
to glow and come to life with this soft
golden-yellow hue, and the Horn seems to be (sss)

1398
01:17:57,485 --> 01:18:01,274
pulled into the box and held aloft in the center.
Your Mage Hand no longer has any sway on it, it is

1399
01:18:01,274 --> 01:18:09,205
locked in place, just in the center of the box, no
seeming physical anything holding it. It's locked

1400
01:18:09,377 --> 01:18:17,146
there. There's almost this creaking sound of air
in there fighting between cold and hot, you can

1401
01:18:17,146 --> 01:18:22,896
hear like, (creaking), there's a small
physical battle between the temperatures as they

1402
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:29,475
take the lid and lift it over and seal it shut. 
The two Bearers lift the chains on

1403
01:18:29,475 --> 01:18:32,205
the side and lift the box between the two of them.

1404
01:18:32,205 --> 01:18:36,515
Kima looks about the rest of you. "So. Onward?"

1405
01:18:36,515 --> 01:18:38,974
SAM: Kima, you're coming with us as well?

1406
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:43,522
MATT: "Damn right. I haven't been back to my
temple in quite some time. It will be good to see

1407
01:18:43,522 --> 01:18:44,406
"Vord."

1408
01:18:44,406 --> 01:18:47,118
ORION: Kima, I'm wondering, who do we speak to?
Who flies the ship?

1409
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:51,753
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't taken a skyship in
quite a while."

1410
01:18:51,753 --> 01:18:53,154
LAURA: I'm excited!

1411
01:18:53,154 --> 01:18:54,607
TRAVIS: I know, I've never been on one!

1412
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:55,799
MARISHA: I know.

1413
01:18:55,799 --> 01:19:00,285
ORION: If we could, maybe we should ask if they
could stop at Kraghammer for a second, we could

1414
01:19:00,285 --> 01:19:02,133
drop in and get our money really quick.

1415
01:19:02,133 --> 01:19:05,901
TALIESIN: On the way back, I think. Once the Horn
is off the ship.

1416
01:19:05,968 --> 01:19:07,707
LAURA: Probably best not to bring it there, yeah.

1417
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:09,603
ORION: You know, yeah, we can use the airship
later on for stuff.

1418
01:19:09,603 --> 01:19:10,744
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

1419
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:11,937
ORION: Which is cool.

1420
01:19:11,937 --> 01:19:13,851
LAURA: (laughs) Which is cool.

1421
01:19:13,906 --> 01:19:15,207
ORION: We have an airship.

1422
01:19:15,278 --> 01:19:16,873
MARISHA: What is this airship made out of?

1423
01:19:16,873 --> 01:19:17,875
ORION: Air and ships.

1424
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:18,853
LAURA: And wood and magic.

1425
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:21,321
TRAVIS: It only floats a couple feet off the ground,
it's not that big of a deal.

1426
01:19:21,435 --> 01:19:27,517
SAM: I pull Vex aside for one second.

1427
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:28,428
LAURA: Me?

1428
01:19:28,428 --> 01:19:34,651
SAM: Yes. Before we go on this quick journey. We
trust all the people who are sending this along

1429
01:19:34,651 --> 01:19:37,343
this journey, right? We trust the Council?

1430
01:19:37,343 --> 01:19:43,502
LAURA: I believe so. I mean, we did a few insight
type things last time, but I mean,

1431
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,811
we can do some more.

1432
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:45,687
SAM: No no no.

1433
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:47,193
ASHLEY: (quietly) But what about the... they sent
the new guards.

1434
01:19:47,193 --> 01:19:48,092
SAM: Huh?

1435
01:19:48,092 --> 01:19:52,222
LAURA: I think we should definitely talk up the
new guards and see what kind of people they are

1436
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:55,052
when we're on our way to the ship, how about
that?

1437
01:19:55,116 --> 01:19:56,314
SAM: All right. Good to go.

1438
01:19:56,314 --> 01:19:58,926
TRAVIS: Brother on the guy, sister on the girl?

1439
01:19:58,926 --> 01:20:01,071
LAURA: Or Scanlan on one.

1440
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:02,132
TRAVIS: Oh.

1441
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:03,437
SAM: I'll take the girl.

1442
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:04,734
LAURA: I'll take the guy.

1443
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:07,070
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

1444
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:12,881
MATT: All right. You guys make your way out of the
palace towards the northwestern side of the

1445
01:20:12,953 --> 01:20:21,031
Cloudtop District, and what you've seen is there
is one thicker tower that is part of the wall that

1446
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:24,836
surrounds the Cloudtop District, what is
essentially the bastion of defense for the inner

1447
01:20:24,836 --> 01:20:28,561
part of the city. There are these small pillars
that hold up the wall, there is one that's very

1448
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:33,025
thick, and you've seen only a couple of skyships
travel to and from, you don't see them in use very

1449
01:20:33,025 --> 01:20:39,232
often. Usually for very specific modes of travel
or reasonings are these employed. But you can see

1450
01:20:39,232 --> 01:20:44,243
this large tower that has a spiral staircase in
the interior that occasionally lets out to these

1451
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:50,918
small windows across the entire length of it as it
rises up hundreds of feet to the very top of the

1452
01:20:50,918 --> 01:20:55,989
tower that surrounds this district. On the top you
can see there is a platform that extends outward

1453
01:20:55,989 --> 01:21:02,015
on both sides of the wall and you can just barely
make out the top of what looks like some sort of

1454
01:21:02,015 --> 01:21:03,895
construct there.

1455
01:21:03,895 --> 01:21:11,849
As you make your way, following Kima up the long
spiral staircase, eventually though it seems way

1456
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:19,285
too long to be traveling up a very thick spiral
staircase, you come to what looks like a trapdoor,

1457
01:21:19,285 --> 01:21:23,985
almost, like a wooden trapdoor. Kima (hrah) lifts
it over (ting ting), you can hear it slap on the

1458
01:21:23,985 --> 01:21:27,988
other side, some of the chains clinking against
the stonework, and daylight comes careening into

1459
01:21:27,988 --> 01:21:32,137
this spiral staircase. You all step out to the top
and immediately are hit with the wind. This high

1460
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,552
up, there's definitely a breeze that blows
through, your hair being tossed a bit.

1461
01:21:35,552 --> 01:21:38,507
(laughter)

1462
01:21:38,507 --> 01:21:39,405
ASHLEY: Whoa!

1463
01:21:39,405 --> 01:21:40,842
LAURA: This is crazy!

1464
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:42,256
TRAVIS: I'm bald.

1465
01:21:42,256 --> 01:21:51,336
MATT: You see roughly five individuals standing,
all in gold and white armor of various types, and

1466
01:21:51,336 --> 01:21:57,789
they are seemingly employees. They are currently
standing, waiting for you. There is one individual

1467
01:21:57,789 --> 01:22:03,221
that is more adorned in what looks like a
captain's uniform, if you will, and above them,

1468
01:22:03,221 --> 01:22:08,537
with a bunch of ropes hanging from the sides of
it, you can see what looks like a large,

1469
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:15,339
beautifully crafted wooden ship that has golden
scrolling, this beautiful elven-like golden

1470
01:22:15,339 --> 01:22:22,130
scrolling across the entire underside of this
wooden ship. You don't see propellers, you see

1471
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:26,901
what looks like two almost wing-like protrusions
on the sides of it, almost like two fans that open

1472
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:33,575
up that are probably used to guide pitch. At the
very front of it, you can see what looks to be in

1473
01:22:33,575 --> 01:22:41,250
the center of the ship one large ten to 15
foot-wide blue crystal that is embedded in the

1474
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:46,858
front of the ship and on the back two more that
are currently attached to the back side. These

1475
01:22:46,858 --> 01:22:52,330
stones slowly rotate in place where they are, and
you can see there's this slight hum of arcane

1476
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:56,963
energy that seems to emanate from them. You can
immediately gather that these three blue stones

1477
01:22:56,963 --> 01:23:03,523
are what holds the ship aloft. Silent and
beautiful.

1478
01:23:03,523 --> 01:23:04,893
LAURA: Awesome!

1479
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:11,424
MATT: As you guys begin to walk up towards this
ship, looming about 15 or 20 feet in the air, the

1480
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:15,044
individuals in front of you all of a sudden glance
over and notice, and the captain steps forward,

1481
01:23:15,044 --> 01:23:20,783
reaches out his hand. "Hi. I'm glad you could
finally make it. We've been waiting for a good 30

1482
01:23:20,783 --> 01:23:26,987
"minutes. I'm Captain Damon, I would like to
welcome you aboard the skyship Deera. We are

1483
01:23:26,987 --> 01:23:30,987
"traveling across the ocean, it's approximately a
week's worth of travel. We have provisions

1484
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:34,534
"provided for you. Do you have any questions?"

1485
01:23:34,534 --> 01:23:36,764
LAURA: Captain Damon?

1486
01:23:36,764 --> 01:23:38,062
MATT: "Yes?"

1487
01:23:38,062 --> 01:23:39,802
LAURA: Just making sure I got your name.

1488
01:23:39,802 --> 01:23:41,551
MARISHA: And like Skipper Veera? Who was?

1489
01:23:41,551 --> 01:23:43,373
SAM: Airship. The airship's called Deera. Deera?

1490
01:23:43,373 --> 01:23:44,430
MATT: Deera.

1491
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:45,920
MARISHA: Oh, the airship.

1492
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:53,562
ASHLEY: I go up to Captain Damon and I put out my
hand and I say, "Captain Damon, it is a very--

1493
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:55,596
"pleasure is all mine."

1494
01:23:55,596 --> 01:23:56,972
MATT: Sturdy shake.

1495
01:23:56,972 --> 01:24:02,940
ASHLEY: I was a deckhand on the Broken Howl and we
heard of many adventures that you had, and maybe

1496
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,510
you've heard of the Broken Howl, maybe you
haven't, but--

1497
01:24:05,594 --> 01:24:07,151
MATT: "No, but I'm willing to hear."

1498
01:24:07,151 --> 01:24:09,881
ASHLEY: It's a pleasure to ride on an airship, so
thanks.

1499
01:24:09,881 --> 01:24:14,678
MATT: "Oh, it's a pleasure to have you. Keep
everything away from the sides."

1500
01:24:14,678 --> 01:24:20,949
MARISHA: I was about to say, I run over to the
side and look over the edge before he says that.

1501
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:23,391
MATT: You guys are still on the platform, he
hasn't led you up to the ship yet.

1502
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,817
MARISHA: Does the platform have like a ledge I can
look over?

1503
01:24:25,817 --> 01:24:26,815
MATT: Yeah.

1504
01:24:26,815 --> 01:24:27,777
MARISHA: Like the Empire State Building?

1505
01:24:27,777 --> 01:24:28,765
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

1506
01:24:28,765 --> 01:24:29,727
MARISHA: I want to do that.

1507
01:24:29,727 --> 01:24:33,796
MATT: Okay, as you do that, "You really shouldn't
do-- she shouldn't do that."

1508
01:24:33,796 --> 01:24:35,293
MARISHA: Guys, this is really high!

1509
01:24:35,293 --> 01:24:36,668
MATT: "She really shouldn't do that, I don't--"

1510
01:24:36,668 --> 01:24:37,724
LAURA: Keyleth, it's really windy!

1511
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:38,865
TALIESIN: It's all right, she can fly.

1512
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:40,784
TRAVIS: I run up behind her and I grab her
shoulders to scare her.

1513
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:41,960
MARISHA: I climb up on the ledge.

1514
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,320
MATT: Okay, as you're climbing up on the ledge,
Grog comes over and goes, "Boo!" and shoves you

1515
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,788
and gives you a scare.

1516
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:50,584
MARISHA: Grog!

1517
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:53,373
TRAVIS: Did you pee a little?

1518
01:24:53,373 --> 01:24:54,870
MARISHA: A little bit.

1519
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:57,414
MATT: At which point you can see the captain's
like (panting).

1520
01:24:57,414 --> 01:24:59,166
LAURA: Don't worry, Captain Damon, they're--

1521
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:00,282
MARISHA: Guys, guys you should try--

1522
01:25:00,282 --> 01:25:01,376
ASHLEY: She can fly.

1523
01:25:01,376 --> 01:25:05,545
MARISHA: Grog, hold the edge of my shirt, I want
to feel like I'm flying for a second.

1524
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:06,673
TRAVIS: Okay.

1525
01:25:06,673 --> 01:25:07,805
MARISHA: Woo-hoo-hoo!

1526
01:25:07,805 --> 01:25:11,288
MATT: "If we could all please make our way to the
ship, we will leave post-haste."

1527
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:13,301
MARISHA: Guys, you should try this!

1528
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:17,688
MATT: He slowly facepalms and glances sidelong to
you and goes, "A week. We have a week."

1529
01:25:17,688 --> 01:25:18,800
LAURA: A week. Yes.

1530
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,116
MATT: "All right."

1531
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:22,718
LIAM: You have flown before. You do remember that,
right?

1532
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:24,212
MARISHA: I know, but I'm always an animal.

1533
01:25:24,212 --> 01:25:29,280
ORION: That's true. As they're doing this, I want
to go to the opposite end so I can get like--

1534
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:34,492
because this is beautiful, and I want to hold out
my staff and I--

1535
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:36,098
LAURA: Are you going to take a selfie?

1536
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:37,979
ORION: And I'm going to cast Image Capture--

1537
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:39,234
ASHLEY: Selfie staff.

1538
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,897
SAM: Image Capture?

1539
01:25:40,897 --> 01:25:41,896
ORION: Yes.

1540
01:25:41,896 --> 01:25:42,871
SAM: That's a thing?

1541
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:44,182
ORION: It is in Draconia.

1542
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:45,266
MARISHA: Selfie staff!

1543
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:46,150
LAURA: Are we taking selfies?

1544
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:47,098
MARISHA: Yes, we are.

1545
01:25:47,098 --> 01:25:49,100
ORION: Getting all of them and the airship while
they're doing it.

1546
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:53,514
MATT: You use your Prestidigitation to temporarily
capture an image of yourself at the edge of the

1547
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:54,851
top of the tower.

1548
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:56,093
ORION: And the airship is in it too.

1549
01:25:56,093 --> 01:25:58,811
MATT: In doing so, the DM imposes disadvantage on
your next two rolls.

1550
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:00,283
ALL: Ohh!

1551
01:26:00,283 --> 01:26:02,683
MATT: No, it's fine, it's fine.

1552
01:26:02,683 --> 01:26:03,808
SAM: Nobody likes a selfie.

1553
01:26:03,808 --> 01:26:05,383
MATT: I just hate selfie sticks so much.

1554
01:26:05,383 --> 01:26:08,190
ASHLEY: Well, what about selfie staffs?

1555
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,501
LAURA: Selfie staffs, though.

1556
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:10,802
TRAVIS: They are the worst.

1557
01:26:10,802 --> 01:26:11,785
MARISHA: Selfie staff.

1558
01:26:11,785 --> 01:26:13,093
MATT: I'll let it pass. It's temporary.

1559
01:26:13,093 --> 01:26:16,671
ORION: Look, everyone.

1560
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,557
LAURA: Oh, that's a good one, that's a really good
one.

1561
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:20,500
MARISHA: That's a good one.

1562
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:24,985
MATT: You hear this loud whistle, this
(wheee-ooo), and the captain you see is blowing on

1563
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:32,637
this loud metal whistle around his neck. "All
aboard! On to the Deera, folks." And everyone

1564
01:26:32,637 --> 01:26:34,488
starts climbing up the ropes that are underneath
the ship.

1565
01:26:34,488 --> 01:26:35,450
LAURA: Oh, ropes.

1566
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:39,820
ASHLEY: If you guys need any help, I can totally
help. Just so you know.

1567
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,322
ORION: (laughs) I can totally do it.

1568
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:47,248
SAM: Captain Damon, just morbid curiosity. Are you
married? Do you have a steady girl?

1569
01:26:47,248 --> 01:26:58,282
MATT: He looks at you with surprise, confusion,
worry, shakes his head out of misunderstanding.

1570
01:26:58,282 --> 01:27:00,076
"What?"

1571
01:27:00,076 --> 01:27:03,135
SAM: Never mind, we'll talk later.

1572
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:09,155
MATT: "All right." He looks entirely side-blasted
by that, he was not expecting that question.

1573
01:27:09,206 --> 01:27:15,598
Nothing negative, just really confused. So as you
all climb your way to the deck, you get on top of

1574
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:20,809
it and it is-- the whole deck has this strange,
slow-floating sensation and once you're on the

1575
01:27:20,809 --> 01:27:25,566
deck you can hear this crackling hum around the
large blue stones holding it aloft.

1576
01:27:25,566 --> 01:27:28,004
LAURA: Wait, how did Trinket get up if we had to
climb ropes?

1577
01:27:28,004 --> 01:27:33,348
MATT: We will say (laughs) there are ways, and if
you ask this question, how'd they get Trinket up,

1578
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:35,470
they go ahead--

1579
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,596
ORION: Winches.

1580
01:27:36,596 --> 01:27:37,812
LAURA: Winches.

1581
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:41,424
MATT: I was going to say, no, the captain gets
back on the ship, goes off to the side, and what

1582
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:44,068
you didn't notice on the far end of the platform
there is like a large crane-like structure.

1583
01:27:44,068 --> 01:27:45,559
MARISHA: Cargo.

1584
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:49,381
MATT: They actually raise up Trinket in a small
sling-like contraption.

1585
01:27:49,381 --> 01:27:50,586
LAURA: You're okay, darling!

1586
01:27:50,586 --> 01:27:54,781
MATT: (worried bear noises) As Trinket's-- it was
bad enough trying to fly when you guys were in the

1587
01:27:54,781 --> 01:27:55,518
Underdark.

1588
01:27:55,518 --> 01:27:56,295
LAURA: Yeah.

1589
01:27:56,295 --> 01:28:02,397
MATT: Now just paddling in the air absentmindedly
as the crane contraption brings Trinket back over

1590
01:28:02,397 --> 01:28:06,549
and lowers him onto the deck of the airship
Deera.

1591
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:07,994
LAURA: All right, all right.

1592
01:28:07,994 --> 01:28:11,512
MATT: Eventually releasing. Trinket's now on board
and looks noticeably uncomfortable and is in the

1593
01:28:11,512 --> 01:28:12,956
center of the ship sitting down.

1594
01:28:12,956 --> 01:28:15,527
LIAM: Does that when he's nervous. Don't mind
him, talk to him.

1595
01:28:15,527 --> 01:28:18,528
MATT: "All right. Everyone on board?"

1596
01:28:18,528 --> 01:28:19,328
SAM: Yes.

1597
01:28:19,512 --> 01:28:20,279
LAURA: Yes.

1598
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:25,584
MATT: "All right. To your quarters underneath. We
set out now to Vasselheim." He blows his whistle a

1599
01:28:25,584 --> 01:28:29,311
second time. All the hands separate, most of them
go underneath the deck.

1600
01:28:29,311 --> 01:28:32,321
LAURA: Where's the box, where's the box. Are we
keeping an eye on the box?

1601
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:38,408
MATT: Yes, you can see now the two Scalebearers
are carrying the box underneath, and on the deck

1602
01:28:38,408 --> 01:28:42,892
you can see there are doorways that lead into
various levels underneath the deck of the ship,

1603
01:28:42,892 --> 01:28:47,521
there is a large cargo lattice section in the
middle of the ship where they're putting larger

1604
01:28:47,521 --> 01:28:54,564
things down below, there is the actual wheel of
the ship is on the back end, on the elevated back

1605
01:28:54,564 --> 01:28:58,653
end of the entire ship, and that's where the
captains stands up to as the rest of the hands

1606
01:28:58,653 --> 01:29:00,765
bring all the ropes up from the side.

1607
01:29:00,765 --> 01:29:05,430
LAURA: I want to stay on top, but I feel like I
should go to keep an eye on the box and see and

1608
01:29:05,485 --> 01:29:06,773
make sure.

1609
01:29:06,773 --> 01:29:10,280
MATT: It's up to you guys. But as the ropes are
brought up, everyone gives a thumbs-up on the

1610
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:18,000
sides, he reaches the front of the ship's wheel,
you see he takes something from his neck and

1611
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,853
places it into the center of the wheel, at which
point the three blue stones spark with additional

1612
01:29:22,853 --> 01:29:28,722
life. The humming gets louder, the ship lurches
for a second, and begins to lift upward with

1613
01:29:28,722 --> 01:29:35,235
this slow, gradual sensation. All of you at once,
your stomach gets that butterfly sensation for a

1614
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:42,831
second, at which point the captain leans forward,
the actual wheel moves forward slightly, and the

1615
01:29:42,831 --> 01:29:48,607
whole ship (whoosh) lurches forward, up and over
Emon, and those of you who are on the deck, you

1616
01:29:48,607 --> 01:29:54,255
can look below you over the side, you can see the
entirety of Emon from above slowly drift away as

1617
01:29:54,255 --> 01:30:01,790
the endless ocean of the Ozmit Sea comes towards
you, clouds ahead, beginning your trek to the

1618
01:30:01,859 --> 01:30:03,096
distant land.

1619
01:30:03,096 --> 01:30:05,021
SAM: I can see my Keep from here!

1620
01:30:05,021 --> 01:30:06,133
MATT: And you can, you can.

1621
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:07,246
MARISHA: Can we see Castle Greyskull?

1622
01:30:07,246 --> 01:30:09,741
MATT: You can see, it's a little blip from here and
it's slowly vanishing, but you can

1623
01:30:09,796 --> 01:30:10,736
definitely see it.

1624
01:30:10,736 --> 01:30:12,145
MARISHA: Hi, Greyskull Keep!

1625
01:30:12,145 --> 01:30:13,655
TALIESIN: We've gotten to sleep there for two
days.

1626
01:30:13,655 --> 01:30:14,397
LAURA: Oh, wow.

1627
01:30:14,397 --> 01:30:15,497
MARISHA: I know, bye!

1628
01:30:15,497 --> 01:30:17,973
MATT: All right, and on that note we'll go ahead
and take our bathroom break real fast,

1629
01:30:17,973 --> 01:30:19,099
take a bio rest.

1630
01:30:19,099 --> 01:30:20,326
TRAVIS: Five minutes?

1631
01:30:20,326 --> 01:30:22,775
MATT: This will be about ten minutes, because I
haven't actually eaten yet either, I haven't had

1632
01:30:22,775 --> 01:30:26,000
time to eat the wonderful food that you guys
provided. Thank you again for dinner.

1633
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,420
LAURA: Oh, go get food.

1634
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:28,546
MARISHA: Thank you for the food, it's so good.

1635
01:30:28,546 --> 01:30:32,273
MATT: Chat bought us an amazing spread. Uh-oh,
Overlords.

1636
01:30:32,273 --> 01:30:33,756
ZAC: You guys can go on your break.

1637
01:30:33,756 --> 01:30:36,135
MATT: He's got this, we'll see you guys in a moment.

1638
01:30:36,135 --> 01:30:38,408
ZAC: I got this.

1639
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,562
MATT: All right.

1640
01:30:39,562 --> 01:30:46,551
ZAC: I got it. Guys, we have one more Soul Hunters
key to give away, and I think we're just nine subs

1641
01:30:46,551 --> 01:30:55,143
from that. We are nine subs away from doing
another book, signed book, and signed photo

1642
01:30:55,143 --> 01:31:03,233
giveaway as well, and that'll, huh? Eight, now. I
stand corrected. Guys, thank you for tuning in.

1643
01:31:03,233 --> 01:31:13,225
You can still donate to 826LA if they can post
that donation link in the chatroom for you. We

1644
01:31:13,396 --> 01:31:19,565
will not be reading donations tonight from
anything less than $20, just so we're not here for

1645
01:31:19,565 --> 01:31:24,574
another hour, because that's-- it's a lot of
messages, so $20 and up and we'll read it.

1646
01:31:24,574 --> 01:31:26,743
MARISHA: We didn't plug 826 at the top, either.

1647
01:31:26,743 --> 01:31:28,569
ZAC: We did not plug 826 at the top, so.

1648
01:31:28,569 --> 01:31:31,553
MARISHA: So yeah, for those of you who might be
new, those of you who are veterans, you already

1649
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:39,944
know, but 826LA is our charity of choice. They are
a after-school non-profit program for kids K-12th

1650
01:31:39,944 --> 01:31:45,224
grade, and they focus on creative writing and
imaginative storytelling and they're right up our

1651
01:31:45,224 --> 01:31:51,060
alley, and they have awesome storefronts. They
have the one in Mar Vista and the one in Echo Park

1652
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:54,829
if you are LA local, and there's probably an 826
in your area.

1653
01:31:54,829 --> 01:31:59,473
ZAC: Why don't you and I go film a video with them
at their storefront that we could play in the

1654
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:00,604
in-between parts of the show?

1655
01:32:00,604 --> 01:32:02,885
MARISHA: Yes, we need that, I messaged them about
that and they're totally down.

1656
01:32:02,954 --> 01:32:03,726
ZAC: Let's do it.

1657
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:04,563
MARISHA: So yeah.

1658
01:32:04,563 --> 01:32:08,602
ZAC: So we'll hopefully have a video for you guys
soon that could show you a little bit about 826LA

1659
01:32:08,602 --> 01:32:13,398
and who they are so we put a face to the
organization that you guys are donating to. The

1660
01:32:13,398 --> 01:32:17,583
other thing I would like to say is-- Lucas, we're
200 away from 4,000?

1661
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:18,595
MARISHA: What what!

1662
01:32:18,595 --> 01:32:19,551
ZAC: Right?

1663
01:32:19,551 --> 01:32:20,857
Lucas: 207.

1664
01:32:20,857 --> 01:32:30,822
ZAC: 207 to be technical. If we get to 4,000 subs
by the end of tonight, I will come up with

1665
01:32:30,822 --> 01:32:36,348
something crazy, because that's a crazy goal. It's
stupid-crazy. I know there's a lot of you

1666
01:32:36,348 --> 01:32:42,351
watching. Just so you guys know, this channel runs
off subscriptions, that is how we pay our hosts,

1667
01:32:42,351 --> 01:32:47,912
that's how we keep the lights turned on, that is
how we do everything. We have a lot of shows on

1668
01:32:47,912 --> 01:32:52,346
this channel, lots of different types of content.
We have shows about movies, we have shows about

1669
01:32:52,346 --> 01:32:56,833
comic books, it's very different for a Twitch
channel. We're trying to do things a lot

1670
01:32:56,833 --> 01:33:04,390
differently. That being said, we don't accept
donations, all donations go to charity 100%. We do

1671
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:09,955
not take any percentage of charity donations, so
subscriptions are the way that this channel keeps

1672
01:33:10,123 --> 01:33:15,828
running. If you like this show, and you like our
other programming, you should subscribe, that's

1673
01:33:15,828 --> 01:33:19,909
what keeps us going. We're trying to get to 7,000
subscribers, because that's what will make us

1674
01:33:19,909 --> 01:33:25,525
break even and start being able to experiment with
newer and much larger programming outside of what

1675
01:33:25,525 --> 01:33:32,057
you already see here. So if we get to 4,000 by the
end of tonight... Man, what's something crazy that

1676
01:33:32,057 --> 01:33:36,060
I could do? What's that, Liam?

1677
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,679
LIAM: Streak!

1678
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:44,456
ZAC: Streak? Thanks, Liam. Yeah, that's great. Not
a good idea. We want that Twitch channel to

1679
01:33:44,456 --> 01:33:53,589
continue on, not get shut down immediately. What
if, here's a crazy goal, because I know it's like

1680
01:33:53,589 --> 01:34:01,557
200 away, that's almost impossible, but if we get
there, I will make, and just so you guys know, I

1681
01:34:01,557 --> 01:34:15,136
made the Critical Role intro video, so I could
make a music video from the cast of Vox Moronica

1682
01:34:15,185 --> 01:34:21,539
set within their world with a song that Alex, Ify
and I could come up with and then we could film a

1683
01:34:21,539 --> 01:34:29,698
music video basically talking about our escapades
that continued on after the show the other night.

1684
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:36,299
That seems crazy enough, that seems crazy enough,
that's a crazy goal. It would be fun. But pretty

1685
01:34:36,299 --> 01:34:41,091
crazy and ridiculous. So I could do that, and I
could have all of our Critical Role guests

1686
01:34:41,091 --> 01:34:49,537
featured in the video as their characters in some
way. So 200. Piece of cake, right? Piece of cake.

1687
01:34:49,537 --> 01:34:55,778
Yeah, we could get 200 subs. Sure. Not a problem.
Right, guys? I'm going to ask that Lucas roll a

1688
01:34:55,778 --> 01:35:00,557
couple commercials, because those commercials help
the channel as well. And after that, we'll roll a

1689
01:35:00,557 --> 01:35:02,875
couple of those intro videos and come right back
for you guys.

1690
01:35:02,875 --> 01:36:13,274
[dramatic music]

1691
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:20,989
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

1692
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:28,671
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

1693
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:32,626
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

1694
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:34,320
(record scratch) Wait.

1695
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:41,060
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

1696
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:44,265
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

1697
01:36:44,265 --> 01:36:45,977
Also ale.

1698
01:36:45,977 --> 01:36:52,374
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

1699
01:36:52,374 --> 01:36:58,918
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

1700
01:36:58,918 --> 01:37:07,137
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

1701
01:37:07,137 --> 01:37:13,854
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience

1702
01:37:14,027 --> 01:37:15,604
cost him dearly.

1703
01:37:15,604 --> 01:37:24,152
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

1704
01:37:24,152 --> 01:37:30,914
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

1705
01:37:30,914 --> 01:37:38,966
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

1706
01:37:38,966 --> 01:37:44,435
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

1707
01:37:44,435 --> 01:37:51,594
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

1708
01:37:51,594 --> 01:37:57,860
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

1709
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:59,285
Also ale!

1710
01:38:00,454 --> 01:38:05,206
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

1711
01:38:05,262 --> 01:38:09,469
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

1712
01:38:09,469 --> 01:38:11,191
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

1713
01:38:11,191 --> 01:38:18,254
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

1714
01:38:18,254 --> 01:38:24,015
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

1715
01:38:24,015 --> 01:38:29,658
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

1716
01:38:29,658 --> 01:38:35,474
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

1717
01:38:35,474 --> 01:38:41,302
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

1718
01:38:41,302 --> 01:38:45,091
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

1719
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:51,028
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

1720
01:38:51,028 --> 01:38:58,694
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

1721
01:38:58,694 --> 01:39:04,286
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

1722
01:39:04,286 --> 01:39:09,355
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

1723
01:39:09,551 --> 01:39:15,719
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

1724
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:21,571
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

1725
01:39:21,571 --> 01:39:27,323
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

1726
01:39:27,323 --> 01:39:34,129
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

1727
01:39:34,129 --> 01:39:40,214
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

1728
01:39:40,214 --> 01:39:41,924
will ever return.

1729
01:39:41,924 --> 01:39:47,282
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

1730
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:53,833
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

1731
01:39:53,833 --> 01:40:02,629
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

1732
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:09,493
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

1733
01:40:09,536 --> 01:40:15,194
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

1734
01:40:15,194 --> 01:40:19,907
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

1735
01:40:19,907 --> 01:40:26,238
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

1736
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:32,178
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

1737
01:40:32,178 --> 01:40:34,327
would stand in their way.

1738
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:39,610
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

1739
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:45,765
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

1740
01:40:45,765 --> 01:40:52,417
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

1741
01:40:52,417 --> 01:40:57,842
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

1742
01:40:57,842 --> 01:41:01,679
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

1743
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:08,890
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

1744
01:41:08,956 --> 01:41:16,507
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

1745
01:41:18,669 --> 01:41:23,905
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near
the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of Deep

1746
01:41:23,905 --> 01:41:30,973
Gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery,
destruction, and trickery left them with the curse

1747
01:41:30,973 --> 01:41:37,852
of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of
healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's

1748
01:41:37,852 --> 01:41:44,284
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family
at a young age after a dream, a dream that changed

1749
01:41:44,284 --> 01:41:50,581
the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted
his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that

1750
01:41:50,581 --> 01:41:58,167
him and his family would live a life of service and
devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal

1751
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:05,746
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she
felt she had a purpose in making things whole that

1752
01:42:05,746 --> 01:42:11,912
had once been broken. She studied and learned the
ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a

1753
01:42:11,912 --> 01:42:18,731
peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day Wilhand
was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath

1754
01:42:18,731 --> 01:42:24,776
barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against
the murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself

1755
01:42:24,776 --> 01:42:32,476
was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned
by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She

1756
01:42:32,476 --> 01:42:39,990
prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could,
bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered

1757
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:47,475
his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were
the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair.

1758
01:42:47,475 --> 01:42:54,804
Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog
would soon return the favor and bring her back from

1759
01:42:54,804 --> 01:43:04,118
the clutches of death. After being killed in battle,
Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it

1760
01:43:04,118 --> 01:43:09,968
would never happen again. She spent four months at
sea, training with the men and women aboard a ship

1761
01:43:10,021 --> 01:43:16,790
called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol
in one hand and her morningstar in the other,

1762
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:19,739
this time, Pike is ready.

1763
01:43:21,143 --> 01:43:26,752
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

1764
01:43:26,752 --> 01:43:28,123
eye on you.

1765
01:43:28,123 --> 01:43:33,790
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

1766
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:37,418
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

1767
01:43:37,418 --> 01:43:43,542
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

1768
01:43:43,542 --> 01:43:49,512
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.

1769
01:43:49,512 --> 01:43:54,732
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world, and honed his

1770
01:43:54,732 --> 01:43:58,020
skills as a bard extraordinaire.

1771
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:02,785
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

1772
01:44:02,785 --> 01:44:08,397
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

1773
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:14,710
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

1774
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:18,394
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

1775
01:44:18,394 --> 01:44:26,215
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

1776
01:44:26,215 --> 01:44:31,502
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

1777
01:44:31,502 --> 01:44:33,023
gnome, Pike.

1778
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:38,828
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

1779
01:44:38,828 --> 01:44:41,327
and makes the females swoon.

1780
01:44:42,973 --> 01:44:50,202
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

1781
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:52,874
located in the heart of Draconia.

1782
01:44:52,874 --> 01:44:58,296
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

1783
01:44:58,296 --> 01:45:03,346
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

1784
01:45:03,346 --> 01:45:08,529
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

1785
01:45:08,599 --> 01:45:13,874
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

1786
01:45:13,874 --> 01:45:18,112
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

1787
01:45:18,112 --> 01:45:24,287
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

1788
01:45:24,287 --> 01:45:29,313
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

1789
01:45:29,313 --> 01:45:32,543
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

1790
01:45:32,543 --> 01:45:37,611
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

1791
01:45:37,611 --> 01:45:42,040
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

1792
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:47,889
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

1793
01:45:47,889 --> 01:45:50,901
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

1794
01:45:50,901 --> 01:45:55,675
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

1795
01:45:55,675 --> 01:46:00,466
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

1796
01:46:00,466 --> 01:46:05,879
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

1797
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:11,295
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

1798
01:46:11,295 --> 01:46:16,581
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

1799
01:46:16,581 --> 01:46:22,520
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

1800
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:27,949
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

1801
01:46:27,949 --> 01:46:35,614
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

1802
01:46:35,614 --> 01:46:40,172
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

1803
01:46:41,922 --> 01:46:47,276
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

1804
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:52,327
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

1805
01:46:52,327 --> 01:46:59,033
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

1806
01:46:59,033 --> 01:47:04,427
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

1807
01:47:04,427 --> 01:47:10,240
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

1808
01:47:10,321 --> 01:47:16,353
and their time in the capital didn't last. The
siblings stole away one autumn night and set out

1809
01:47:16,353 --> 01:47:18,163
on the open road.

1810
01:47:18,163 --> 01:47:23,460
After a few years of wandering, they eventually
decided to return to their mother, and journeyed

1811
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:29,664
back to the lands of their youth. But instead of
finding their childhood home, they returned to a

1812
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:36,162
pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home
burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for

1813
01:47:36,162 --> 01:47:46,165
answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and

1814
01:47:46,165 --> 01:47:49,942
his sister set out to find their fortune together
in Tal'Dorei.

1815
01:47:49,942 --> 01:47:57,006
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to
solve life's challenges in his own particular way,

1816
01:47:57,006 --> 01:48:03,537
often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his
knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

1817
01:48:03,537 --> 01:48:08,774
(knife scraping) the way of blades the elves
schooled him in more than

1818
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,698
makes up the difference.

1819
01:48:10,698 --> 01:48:16,395
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

1820
01:48:16,395 --> 01:48:23,704
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

1821
01:48:23,704 --> 01:48:28,865
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

1822
01:48:28,865 --> 01:48:34,411
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world

1823
01:48:34,411 --> 01:48:36,800
were each other.

1824
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:41,868
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn,

1825
01:48:41,868 --> 01:48:48,689
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

1826
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:55,427
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

1827
01:48:55,427 --> 01:48:59,194
indifference behind, and set out on their own.

1828
01:48:59,194 --> 01:49:07,291
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets
and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept

1829
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:10,619
to the woods; she preferred the isolation.

1830
01:49:10,619 --> 01:49:18,189
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and
to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a

1831
01:49:18,234 --> 01:49:24,919
series of fateful events, earned herself a
companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen

1832
01:49:24,919 --> 01:49:29,534
Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her
fiercely.

1833
01:49:29,534 --> 01:49:35,659
Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

1834
01:49:35,659 --> 01:50:44,180
[dramatic music]

1835
01:50:45,066 --> 01:50:50,220
MATT: Welcome back. We have eaten, we have had
drinks, we have used the restroom, and now we

1836
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:55,711
return to adventure. While we were gone, I hear
that there was a ridiculous thing that our

1837
01:50:55,711 --> 01:51:00,388
wondrous Overlord put as a subscriber
opportunity.

1838
01:51:00,388 --> 01:51:01,784
ZAC: I'm going to regret it!

1839
01:51:01,784 --> 01:51:02,981
MARISHA: What? What happened?

1840
01:51:02,981 --> 01:51:04,512
MATT: If we somehow get to 4,000--

1841
01:51:04,512 --> 01:51:08,952
ZAC: We've already gotten 70 subs since
I announced it.

1842
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:16,429
MATT: Okay, so if we get to 4,000 subs tonight,
we're going to have Ify and people of the Vox

1843
01:51:16,429 --> 01:51:21,868
Moronica crew, that did our quick little one-shot
at the DM episode, create a rap and shoot a music

1844
01:51:21,868 --> 01:51:24,655
video that will include us.

1845
01:51:24,655 --> 01:51:26,809
LIAM: Come on, guys, one time offer. You're going
to let it slip through your fingers?

1846
01:51:26,809 --> 01:51:27,603
TALIESIN: We're going to do that?

1847
01:51:27,603 --> 01:51:28,530
MARISHA: That'll include us?

1848
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:29,792
MATT: That'll include us in it some way.

1849
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:30,994
MARISHA: We're going to shoot a rap video?

1850
01:51:30,994 --> 01:51:32,060
TALIESIN: We're going to shoot a rap video?

1851
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,230
MATT: If they get to 4,000--

1852
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:34,283
MARISHA: By the end of the show?

1853
01:51:34,283 --> 01:51:35,405
MATT: -- subscribers, yeah, by the end of the
show.

1854
01:51:35,405 --> 01:51:36,760
ORION: Can we do it like it's from 1993?

1855
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:42,366
ZAC: Oh, I'm going to do it however the
fuck I want to do it, and I can guarantee that Vox

1856
01:51:42,366 --> 01:51:46,196
Moronica will look much better in the video than
you guys will.

1857
01:51:46,196 --> 01:51:50,389
LAURA: Why would we agree to it?

1858
01:51:50,389 --> 01:51:54,891
LIAM: It's just so crazy it might work.

1859
01:51:54,891 --> 01:51:56,587
ASHLEY: (gasps) Oh! Is this a challenge?

1860
01:51:56,587 --> 01:51:58,149
MARISHA: Oh, is this going to be like a role
reversal thing? In like an alternate universe?

1861
01:51:58,149 --> 01:52:00,178
MATT: I think the Overlord just threw down the
gauntlet of Vox Moronica looking better than Vox

1862
01:52:00,178 --> 01:52:01,410
Machina in the music video.

1863
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:02,547
LAURA: I think it's on.

1864
01:52:02,547 --> 01:52:04,609
TALIESIN: I think he underestimates how naturally
pretty we all are.

1865
01:52:04,664 --> 01:52:06,325
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah.

1866
01:52:06,325 --> 01:52:09,180
MATT: I think we're underestimating how naturally
ridiculous that crew is, so it is a good

1867
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,779
challenge. It's a tough call.

1868
01:52:10,779 --> 01:52:13,337
LIAM: Classic dwarven fundraising technique!

1869
01:52:13,337 --> 01:52:21,916
MATT: Thank you kindly, my dear. DM presents are
nice. It's delicious brandy, thank you.

1870
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:27,494
MARISHA: Oh wait, didn't we have cake? I want that
cake up in here. Are we going to wait?

1871
01:52:27,494 --> 01:52:30,237
MATT: (sings) You want this cake? I want it! You
want this cake? I want it.

1872
01:52:30,237 --> 01:52:31,336
LAURA: It's special.

1873
01:52:31,336 --> 01:52:32,593
MATT: Sorry, a little internet there for you.

1874
01:52:32,593 --> 01:52:34,099
LIAM: Make me a glass of that grog?

1875
01:52:34,099 --> 01:52:35,942
LAURA: Nope, none for you, darling.

1876
01:52:35,942 --> 01:52:38,349
ASHLEY: Take a sipsy?

1877
01:52:38,349 --> 01:52:47,093
MATT: All right folks. Welcome back. Let's get
back into the swing of things. Quick reminder,

1878
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:53,758
every 50 subscribers we give out a signed player's
handbook and a signed cast photo. We also have the

1879
01:52:53,758 --> 01:52:55,416
shirts for sale on the Teespring.

1880
01:52:55,416 --> 01:52:56,244
MARISHA: Get some shirts.

1881
01:52:56,244 --> 01:52:57,007
TALIESIN: Yes!

1882
01:52:57,007 --> 01:52:59,216
SAM: Shirts, shirts, shirts! Two weeks and
counting. 13 days left.

1883
01:52:59,216 --> 01:53:01,190
MARISHA: We forgot to wear one of ours, but
they're cool.

1884
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:02,440
ORION: Are they out now?

1885
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:03,184
MARISHA: Yeah.

1886
01:53:03,184 --> 01:53:04,275
ORION: Oh, cool!

1887
01:53:04,275 --> 01:53:05,751
MARISHA: We made those in honor of E3.

1888
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:09,150
MATT: Soul Hunter keys have been going away, but
for those who missed it earlier there's a new app

1889
01:53:09,150 --> 01:53:14,598
out called Soul Hunters that I did some voices on
and if you download the game and put in the promo

1890
01:53:14,598 --> 01:53:19,739
code "criticalrole," one word, you get a free
character that I voiced as well so check it out.

1891
01:53:19,739 --> 01:53:20,829
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1892
01:53:20,829 --> 01:53:24,295
MARISHA: By the way, I will say, Soul Hunters is a
misleading title because that sounds dark and

1893
01:53:24,295 --> 01:53:26,099
ominous and it's a super cute game.

1894
01:53:26,099 --> 01:53:27,574
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a weird choice then.

1895
01:53:27,574 --> 01:53:34,076
MARISHA: Yeah, wouldn't you think it sounds dark
and ominous? It's super cute. It's like with cute

1896
01:53:34,076 --> 01:53:35,855
chibi RPG characters.

1897
01:53:35,855 --> 01:53:37,578
MATT: Yeah, no, there's no more keys. It's just
the promo code you can use now.

1898
01:53:37,578 --> 01:53:39,274
TRAVIS: Weird. Cool choice. Strange, though.

1899
01:53:39,274 --> 01:53:40,341
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

1900
01:53:40,341 --> 01:53:46,611
MATT: All right, so. Returning back. You guys are
now traversing the extended Ozmit Sea towards

1901
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:51,543
Othanzia upon the skyship Deera.

1902
01:53:51,543 --> 01:53:54,545
ORION: How many days away are we now?

1903
01:53:54,545 --> 01:53:58,434
MATT: I'd say, we'll start it about two days into
the journey.

1904
01:53:58,434 --> 01:54:00,715
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend that time reading my
book.

1905
01:54:00,715 --> 01:54:03,112
MARISHA: Yeah, and me too. I'll read books.

1906
01:54:03,112 --> 01:54:09,147
MATT: Okay, you guys take time studying. We'll say
you probably have a few more days of eight-hour

1907
01:54:09,147 --> 01:54:12,979
days studying, going about eight to ten hours a
day if you want to take in the reading

1908
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:14,097
books you got.

1909
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:17,105
MARISHA: I'll also go ahead and-- oh you have this
book! Are you reading that book?

1910
01:54:17,105 --> 01:54:18,503
TALIESIN: I'm reading that book.

1911
01:54:18,503 --> 01:54:32,155
MARISHA: I'm going to make a few scrolls in my
time as well. What should I make scrolls for,

1912
01:54:32,155 --> 01:54:33,931
guys? What's handy to have?

1913
01:54:33,931 --> 01:54:38,510
SAM: Oh, well, when you made me something once
that was really cool but I think

1914
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:39,738
that was a spell.

1915
01:54:39,738 --> 01:54:41,823
MARISHA: What's handy to have? Well, yeah, I can
make spells into scrolls.

1916
01:54:41,823 --> 01:54:44,414
TRAVIS: Can you make something so that if we fall
out of the sky we don't die?

1917
01:54:44,414 --> 01:54:46,344
SAM: Hey, you know what we always need? What we
always need?

1918
01:54:46,344 --> 01:54:49,168
TALIESIN: Anti-petrify?

1919
01:54:49,168 --> 01:54:52,075
SAM: How to carry Trinket on the goddamn carpet.

1920
01:54:52,075 --> 01:54:53,024
LAURA: Oh yeah!

1921
01:54:53,024 --> 01:54:54,538
MARISHA: Right, okay you're talking about the
Levitation and stuff.

1922
01:54:54,538 --> 01:54:56,082
LAURA: Well, you guys can shrink him, you have
Polymorph.

1923
01:54:56,082 --> 01:54:57,230
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's true.

1924
01:54:57,230 --> 01:55:00,107
SAM: Yeah, but we're always like one body short of
being able to pile onto the carpet.

1925
01:55:00,107 --> 01:55:04,892
ASHLEY: Can't we add a little bit extra square
footage to the magic carpet?

1926
01:55:04,963 --> 01:55:06,993
MATT: Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.

1927
01:55:06,993 --> 01:55:09,780
MARISHA: I'll make a Polymorph scroll and give it
to--

1928
01:55:09,851 --> 01:55:12,789
LIAM: What about a steampunk rocket pack for the
bear?

1929
01:55:12,789 --> 01:55:14,970
MARISHA: This isn't World of Warcraft.

1930
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:19,512
TALIESIN: I'm working on it. I'm working on it.
I'm working on it!

1931
01:55:19,512 --> 01:55:20,822
ORION: How many can you make?

1932
01:55:20,822 --> 01:55:25,951
MARISHA: Well I can make-- I just put whatever
spells I've learned for the day, I can put those--

1933
01:55:25,951 --> 01:55:33,980
depending on the level, like a 3rd-level spell
scroll will take me four to six hours, so the

1934
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:39,011
higher the spell, the longer it takes. So, if I
spend two days I can probably make four scrolls?

1935
01:55:39,011 --> 01:55:40,283
Four or five scrolls?

1936
01:55:40,283 --> 01:55:41,999
LAURA: I like it.

1937
01:55:41,999 --> 01:55:45,979
MARISHA: Yeah, that's some pretty good shit. So
I'll definitely make a Polymorph scroll for you.

1938
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,049
LAURA: Thank you!

1939
01:55:47,049 --> 01:55:51,108
MATT: Let me first double-check about the time
process. Creating a scroll...

1940
01:55:51,108 --> 01:55:55,192
MARISHA: That's the way it was in Pathfinder, I am
using Pathfinder rules.

1941
01:55:55,192 --> 01:55:57,107
LAURA: I'm getting so many things added to my
inventory during this game.

1942
01:55:57,107 --> 01:55:58,964
MARISHA: I know! (singing) We went shopping!

1943
01:55:58,964 --> 01:56:04,231
LAURA: This is exciting. I got arrows, I got
scrolls. I have a question about Trinket's new armor.

1944
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:05,199
MATT: Yes?

1945
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:09,858
LAURA: It has an area for me to ride on him still,
right? Like the other armor? I forgot to mention

1946
01:56:09,858 --> 01:56:11,977
it to her.

1947
01:56:11,977 --> 01:56:15,317
MATT: (laughs) I mean, there's not like a saddle
or anything.

1948
01:56:15,317 --> 01:56:18,691
LAURA: But the last one had a divot thing so I
could fit.

1949
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:22,836
MATT: Yeah. It's built off the design of the
original armor that you had customized so, yeah,

1950
01:56:22,836 --> 01:56:24,401
that's still there.

1951
01:56:24,401 --> 01:56:29,918
TRAVIS: Is there a bow on this ship? Like a front,
pointy part?

1952
01:56:29,918 --> 01:56:31,169
MATT: Yes, there is.

1953
01:56:31,169 --> 01:56:35,659
TRAVIS: Pike and I would like to go to the front
of the ship and I would like to stand at the front

1954
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:37,432
and put my arms out.

1955
01:56:37,432 --> 01:56:38,649
ASHLEY: And I'm going to hold his waist.

1956
01:56:38,649 --> 01:56:40,928
TRAVIS: And I'm going to shout: I'm the goliath of
the world!

1957
01:56:40,928 --> 01:56:43,159
LIAM: Oh, he fell right off the front.

1958
01:56:43,159 --> 01:56:44,225
TRAVIS: No I did not!

1959
01:56:44,225 --> 01:56:46,085
(laughter)

1960
01:56:46,085 --> 01:56:52,590
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you Pike! I feel like I'm
flying!

1961
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:54,107
ASHLEY: You are! You are!

1962
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:58,821
LIAM: Look at the guns on that gnome!

1963
01:56:58,821 --> 01:57:06,848
ORION: I can spend the days crafting and then
wouldn't I just need whatever gold that would be?

1964
01:57:06,848 --> 01:57:10,736
MATT: You mean just crafting the jewelry element
of it?

1965
01:57:10,736 --> 01:57:15,236
ORION: Yeah, because the enchantment's-- that's
over there. I'm just not doing anything else.

1966
01:57:15,236 --> 01:57:19,150
MATT: You didn't bring any crafting tools with you
for that. Crafting jewelry requires a specific

1967
01:57:19,206 --> 01:57:24,778
set of tools. Yeah, unfortunately. When you touch
down, you can try to find somebody in the

1968
01:57:24,778 --> 01:57:27,366
vicinity. The journey, here, y'know.

1969
01:57:27,366 --> 01:57:28,727
ORION: Yeah, airship.

1970
01:57:28,727 --> 01:57:30,033
LIAM: Hey DM.

1971
01:57:30,033 --> 01:57:30,934
MATT: Yes?

1972
01:57:30,934 --> 01:57:36,952
LIAM: Since Vax has nothing really to prepare ever
and he's in obviously peak physical condition, I'm

1973
01:57:36,952 --> 01:57:43,885
going to spend the trip helping Keyleth and if she
needs any ingredients for whatever she's doing,

1974
01:57:43,885 --> 01:57:49,615
I'll go get them, I'll hold things up for her, I'm
just going to hang out and try to help her get

1975
01:57:49,615 --> 01:57:50,620
things done.

1976
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:51,946
LAURA: You're so helpful, brother.

1977
01:57:51,946 --> 01:57:54,644
MARISHA: It's like I have a little familiar. A
scroll-making familiar!

1978
01:57:54,644 --> 01:57:57,167
MATT: All right, not bad, not bad.

1979
01:57:57,167 --> 01:58:02,425
LAURA: I thought you were into Gilmore, darling.
(laughs)

1980
01:58:02,425 --> 01:58:05,502
LIAM: I'm hard to pin down.

1981
01:58:05,502 --> 01:58:11,066
MATT: For the time being, because I don't want to
spend too much time with the internet watching me

1982
01:58:11,241 --> 01:58:13,818
scan through the books to find the rules for
scroll crafting.

1983
01:58:13,818 --> 01:58:15,520
LIAM: That's the best part.

1984
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:21,565
MATT: Well, yeah. I'll say for the time being,
it'll take you about half a day to make the

1985
01:58:21,565 --> 01:58:27,618
Polymorph scroll and the material components that
are required for the spell putting into the actual

1986
01:58:27,618 --> 01:58:34,394
scroll would run you about 300 gold, I'll say. Oh,
400 gold because it's a 4th-level spell isn't it?

1987
01:58:34,394 --> 01:58:36,079
What level spell is Polymorph?

1988
01:58:36,259 --> 01:58:37,272
MARISHA: Four.

1989
01:58:37,272 --> 01:58:38,595
MATT: Okay, 400 gold.

1990
01:58:38,595 --> 01:58:40,228
MARISHA: Okay, how much gold do we have left
anyway?

1991
01:58:40,228 --> 01:58:43,169
LAURA: Well, I mean, I can use my personal but we
have very little party funds.

1992
01:58:43,169 --> 01:58:45,126
MARISHA: Okay, so I still have a little personal
money left too.

1993
01:58:45,126 --> 01:58:47,429
MATT: I'm sure it'll be different later but
whatever. They're on a ship so it's hard to get

1994
01:58:47,429 --> 01:58:48,542
the materials.

1995
01:58:48,542 --> 01:58:52,405
SAM: It's fine, we'll be fine. Don't waste your
money.

1996
01:58:52,405 --> 01:58:56,407
MARISHA: No, it's okay. No, I'm going to do it.
That's what money's for. I'm going to do two

1997
01:58:56,407 --> 01:58:57,383
Polymorph spells.

1998
01:58:57,383 --> 01:58:58,593
MATT: All right.

1999
01:58:58,593 --> 01:59:03,050
MARISHA: And give one to Vex and one to Tiberius.

2000
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:04,145
MATT: All right.

2001
01:59:04,145 --> 01:59:06,694
LAURA: All right, I'm taking 400 gold out of my
personal.

2002
01:59:06,749 --> 01:59:08,525
MARISHA: And I'll take 400 out of mine.

2003
01:59:08,525 --> 01:59:14,330
ORION: Oh, I still have mine. I can give you 400.

2004
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:15,691
MARISHA: You'll give me 400? All right.

2005
01:59:15,691 --> 01:59:16,737
MATT: All right.

2006
01:59:16,737 --> 01:59:22,133
LAURA: I'm spending most of the time up near
Captain Damon, watching him work.

2007
01:59:22,133 --> 01:59:29,863
MATT: He seems very focused on keeping the ship
going. He does steer you around one thunderstorm

2008
01:59:29,863 --> 01:59:37,267
that's rolling by and takes you on the wide angle
around. It's very relaxing up here, a little cold.

2009
01:59:37,267 --> 01:59:53,735
But it's relaxing. Let's say, the beginning of day
three, as you all are resting underneath the hold,

2010
01:59:53,735 --> 02:00:03,977
you're all shaken awake by a sudden lurching of
the ship. It just shifts in such a heavy way that

2011
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:09,512
you aren't expecting it. All of you are pulled out
of your stupor for a second and begin coming out

2012
02:00:09,518 --> 02:00:12,901
of your individual rooms to check on each other
and see what happened, but apparently the ship is

2013
02:00:12,901 --> 02:00:17,215
or was-- some sort of a shuddering physicality to
it.

2014
02:00:17,215 --> 02:00:20,794
TRAVIS: I rush to the box.

2015
02:00:20,794 --> 02:00:25,528
SAM: I rush to Captain Damon. What the hell just
happened? Also, are you married?

2016
02:00:25,528 --> 02:00:33,911
MATT: All right, so you rush straight to the box and as
you go to open the door that leads to the boxes,

2017
02:00:33,964 --> 02:00:44,679
you can see, in the room, is Kima and both of the
Scalebearers are there, reaching for weapons as

2018
02:00:44,679 --> 02:00:49,638
the door opens. They see you and relax for a
second and Kima goes like, "What was that? What

2019
02:00:49,638 --> 02:00:50,671
"was that?"

2020
02:00:50,671 --> 02:00:51,945
TRAVIS: I was going to ask you the same thing.

2021
02:00:51,945 --> 02:00:52,721
MARISHA: Shit.

2022
02:00:52,721 --> 02:00:53,667
MATT: "I have no idea."

2023
02:00:53,667 --> 02:00:55,442
ORION: I rush up to the bow.

2024
02:00:55,442 --> 02:00:56,788
MARISHA: I also rush to the deck.

2025
02:00:56,788 --> 02:00:59,661
MATT: Okay, as you guys are rushing up along with
Scanlan-- everyone else rushes up-- you come to

2026
02:00:59,661 --> 02:01:05,281
the surface and you're just cresting into sunrise,
like the sky itself is mostly dark on one side

2027
02:01:05,281 --> 02:01:11,812
with the blue slowly leading into a bright
orange-ish yellow to the other side as the morning

2028
02:01:12,001 --> 02:01:17,677
light is starting to slowly crest over the
horizon. As you get to the surface you immediately

2029
02:01:17,677 --> 02:01:24,460
notice there are a handful of large, winged
creatures that are currently harrying the side of

2030
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:30,124
the boat. As you step to the surface you see
(shhw) one just dives past you real fast. You

2031
02:01:30,124 --> 02:01:34,482
notice as one of them takes off in the
distance-- it was just a blur of quick-moving

2032
02:01:34,501 --> 02:01:42,988
wings-- it looks dragon-like in its physicality but
it's smaller than any dragon you've encountered.

2033
02:01:43,053 --> 02:01:47,286
It's flapping giant wings and lets out a 
screech as it takes off, but it looks like there's

2034
02:01:47,286 --> 02:01:48,748
something on its back.

2035
02:01:48,748 --> 02:01:49,787
TRAVIS: What?

2036
02:01:49,787 --> 02:01:53,080
MATT: You see two to three more of these now
starting to divebomb.

2037
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:54,336
SAM: It's Daenerys!

2038
02:01:54,336 --> 02:01:59,234
MATT: You can see the rest of the deckhands are up
there now, with weapons ready, and are starting to

2039
02:01:59,234 --> 02:02:00,561
fight some of these off.

2040
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:05,290
LAURA: Can we use any kind of perception to see if
the things on them are controlling them?

2041
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:06,559
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

2042
02:02:06,559 --> 02:02:08,272
LAURA: I get plus two for any dragon-y things.

2043
02:02:08,272 --> 02:02:09,541
MATT: Good to know!

2044
02:02:09,541 --> 02:02:15,646
SAM: Tiberius, your brothers are here!

2045
02:02:15,646 --> 02:02:19,129
ORION: I don't think I'm associated with these.

2046
02:02:19,129 --> 02:02:21,104
LAURA: 19.

2047
02:02:21,104 --> 02:02:23,770
MATT: 19. Glancing at the backs of these--

2048
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:24,980
LIAM: (garbled) 26!

2049
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:25,990
MATT: What did you say?

2050
02:02:25,990 --> 02:02:27,005
TRAVIS: What?

2051
02:02:27,005 --> 02:02:27,955
LIAM: 26.

2052
02:02:27,955 --> 02:02:34,576
MATT: 26. All right, between the two of you, you notice
that even in this low-light circumstance, there

2053
02:02:34,633 --> 02:02:40,802
appear to be on three of these winged, dragon-like
creatures smallish, humanoid entities that are on

2054
02:02:40,802 --> 02:02:46,705
small, almost leather strapped saddles that are
put on the sides of this creature. They're

2055
02:02:46,705 --> 02:02:52,227
clutching onto it and each one is carrying some
sort of large, spear-like weapon. There is a

2056
02:02:52,227 --> 02:02:56,731
fourth one in the distance that does not appear to
be dragonoid. This one appears to be

2057
02:02:56,731 --> 02:02:59,398
feather-covered in its physical form.

2058
02:02:59,398 --> 02:03:01,817
MARISHA: Feather-covered?

2059
02:03:01,817 --> 02:03:04,229
ORION: There's a big large one, right though?

2060
02:03:04,229 --> 02:03:07,741
MATT: Yes. Which, at this moment, we are going to
roll initiative.

2061
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:09,853
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

2062
02:03:09,853 --> 02:03:11,199
MATT: You can.

2063
02:03:11,199 --> 02:03:12,924
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2064
02:03:12,924 --> 02:03:17,152
ORION: I cast Blur before any of that shit. I
didn't get to say what I wanted to do.

2065
02:03:17,205 --> 02:03:22,831
TALIESIN: Ugh. That's the worst initiative I am
capable of having.

2066
02:03:22,831 --> 02:03:25,015
SAM: I'm just going to keep rolling until I get a
better number.

2067
02:03:25,015 --> 02:03:27,288
MARISHA: Do I do a nature roll first or should I
do an initiative roll first?

2068
02:03:27,288 --> 02:03:28,462
SAM: Wow.

2069
02:03:28,462 --> 02:03:29,627
TRAVIS: Sweet.

2070
02:03:29,627 --> 02:03:31,357
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check first?

2071
02:03:31,357 --> 02:03:35,113
MATT: First, I want to place you guys. So you guys
are coming up from below, so I would

2072
02:03:35,113 --> 02:03:35,979
probably put you--

2073
02:03:35,979 --> 02:03:37,290
LAURA: Oh my God look at the ship!

2074
02:03:37,290 --> 02:03:38,136
ASHLEY: Whoa!

2075
02:03:38,136 --> 02:03:39,503
MARISHA: Cool, look at that!

2076
02:03:39,503 --> 02:03:41,346
SAM: Oh, I like that.

2077
02:03:41,346 --> 02:03:42,667
TRAVIS: Dude, that's pretty.

2078
02:03:42,667 --> 02:03:44,225
LAURA: Look at the crystals!

2079
02:03:44,225 --> 02:03:51,038
SAM: Oh, wow. I like how all of our viewers are
just looking at our midsections.

2080
02:03:51,038 --> 02:03:53,214
LIAM: Aw, I've got to turn on Twitch so I can see
it.

2081
02:03:53,214 --> 02:03:55,580
MARISHA: Turn on Twitch, turn on Twitch!

2082
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:56,838
MATT: Oh, Liam.

2083
02:03:56,838 --> 02:04:01,537
TRAVIS: Here, I'll pick you up. Don't do it.
Ready?

2084
02:04:01,537 --> 02:04:04,471
LAURA: It looks like the crystals are really 3D in
the picture.

2085
02:04:04,645 --> 02:04:06,169
ASHLEY: (gasps) Matt!

2086
02:04:06,169 --> 02:04:07,585
LIAM: Well, the Twitch, the Twitch is up.

2087
02:04:07,585 --> 02:04:09,283
LAURA: That's amazing!

2088
02:04:09,283 --> 02:04:16,558
LIAM: (gasps) This is like that Jabba's Cruiser
game that came out.

2089
02:04:16,558 --> 02:04:17,959
TRAVIS: Totally.

2090
02:04:17,959 --> 02:04:19,001
LIAM: Anybody, anybody?

2091
02:04:19,001 --> 02:04:19,801
LAURA: No.

2092
02:04:19,801 --> 02:04:20,578
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2093
02:04:20,578 --> 02:04:21,986
SAM: Yes. Yeah sure, that.

2094
02:04:21,986 --> 02:04:23,291
TRAVIS: (whisper) Return of the Jedi.

2095
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:24,453
MATT: All righty, so.

2096
02:04:24,453 --> 02:04:29,193
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Whoa.

2097
02:04:29,193 --> 02:04:33,707
MATT: As you guys come up to the surface, you can
see these three entities swooping around and

2098
02:04:33,707 --> 02:04:40,011
dive-bombing the remainder of the guard and
deckhands that are now, currently, have haphazard

2099
02:04:40,011 --> 02:04:43,982
armor on and they're trying to strike at these
things as they swing by. Let's go ahead and roll

2100
02:04:43,982 --> 02:04:45,584
initiative, folks.

2101
02:04:45,584 --> 02:04:47,060
TRAVIS: Did it.

2102
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:55,363
MARISHA: Oh, that's not bad, that's all right.
I'll take that.

2103
02:04:55,363 --> 02:04:57,694
MATT: So, we have 25 to 20?

2104
02:04:57,694 --> 02:04:58,886
LAURA: 22.

2105
02:04:58,886 --> 02:05:00,433
MATT: 22.

2106
02:05:00,433 --> 02:05:01,713
LIAM: 20.

2107
02:05:01,713 --> 02:05:03,851
MATT: Who else had their hand up?

2108
02:05:03,851 --> 02:05:04,961
LAURA: 20.

2109
02:05:04,961 --> 02:05:12,516
MATT: Okay, so 20. All right. 20 to 15?

2110
02:05:12,516 --> 02:05:13,677
ORION: 19.

2111
02:05:13,677 --> 02:05:14,674
TRAVIS: 19.

2112
02:05:14,674 --> 02:05:16,104
LIAM: 20.

2113
02:05:16,104 --> 02:05:17,334
LAURA: (laughs) He heard you.

2114
02:05:17,334 --> 02:05:18,197
TRAVIS: We already got your 20.

2115
02:05:18,197 --> 02:05:19,141
SAM: We got your damn 20.

2116
02:05:19,141 --> 02:05:20,078
MARISHA: 17.

2117
02:05:20,078 --> 02:05:21,046
MATT: Hold on.

2118
02:05:21,046 --> 02:05:22,303
TRAVIS: 19, 19.

2119
02:05:22,303 --> 02:05:25,749
MATT: 17, you said, Keyleth?

2120
02:05:25,749 --> 02:05:26,707
MARISHA: Yep.

2121
02:05:26,707 --> 02:05:34,333
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

2122
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:37,765
TRAVIS: 15 to ten?

2123
02:05:37,765 --> 02:05:39,268
MATT: Ten to five?

2124
02:05:39,268 --> 02:05:40,186
TALIESIN: Nine.

2125
02:05:40,186 --> 02:05:41,028
SAM: Eight.

2126
02:05:41,028 --> 02:05:43,207
TRAVIS: Look at Percy.

2127
02:05:43,207 --> 02:05:44,648
LAURA: What did you get?

2128
02:05:44,648 --> 02:05:45,605
SAM: We always get the lowest.

2129
02:05:45,605 --> 02:05:46,652
ASHLEY: What up, four?

2130
02:05:46,652 --> 02:05:48,091
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

2131
02:05:48,091 --> 02:05:49,648
ASHLEY: Hey, it's not bad for the cleric to go
last.

2132
02:05:49,648 --> 02:05:51,136
LAURA: That's true!

2133
02:05:51,136 --> 02:05:56,642
MATT: All right. So, top of the round. Vex, you've
got this.

2134
02:05:56,642 --> 02:06:03,570
LAURA: Okay! I'm going to do-- they're all far
away from each other, aren't they?

2135
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:07,893
MATT: They're all pretty spread out now, yeah.
They're all recouping from what looked like a

2136
02:06:07,893 --> 02:06:12,701
coordinated attack, and you can see, there appears
to be-- what you normally see are about four to

2137
02:06:12,701 --> 02:06:17,547
five deckhands. There's only three up there right
now with Captain Damon.

2138
02:06:17,547 --> 02:06:18,941
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

2139
02:06:18,941 --> 02:06:21,416
MATT: They're either sleeping or not currently in
the battle.

2140
02:06:21,416 --> 02:06:23,511
ORION: What color are the dragons?

2141
02:06:23,511 --> 02:06:27,238
MATT: From what you can tell, the dragon-like
creatures-- which, as you get a better look at

2142
02:06:27,238 --> 02:06:33,584
these moment, you know these. A large number of
the Draconian army utilizes these as mounts. These

2143
02:06:33,584 --> 02:06:46,704
are wyverns, and they are all in a ruddy, brown,
brass-like coloration to their form. Best you can

2144
02:06:46,704 --> 02:06:49,578
tell in this light. All right. Vex, what are you
doing?

2145
02:06:49,578 --> 02:06:57,096
LAURA: I am going to Hunter's Mark one of the ones
with the rider on them.

2146
02:06:57,096 --> 02:06:59,549
MATT: Okay. All of them have a rider, it seems.

2147
02:06:59,549 --> 02:07:00,689
LAURA: Oh, all of them?

2148
02:07:00,689 --> 02:07:01,514
ORION: Yes.

2149
02:07:01,514 --> 02:07:02,634
LAURA: Even the one with feathers?

2150
02:07:02,634 --> 02:07:03,663
MATT: Even the one with feathers.

2151
02:07:03,663 --> 02:07:04,844
LAURA: I'll go for the feathered one, then.

2152
02:07:04,844 --> 02:07:07,049
MATT: All right. Hunter's Mark.

2153
02:07:07,049 --> 02:07:10,849
LAURA: Hunter's Mark! Hunter's ring.

2154
02:07:10,849 --> 02:07:12,801
MATT: Hunter's ring. All right.

2155
02:07:12,801 --> 02:07:20,559
LAURA: And I'm going to Hail of Thorns him at a
level three.

2156
02:07:20,629 --> 02:07:22,696
MATT: Okay.

2157
02:07:22,696 --> 02:07:24,001
LAURA: Yeah?

2158
02:07:24,001 --> 02:07:27,774
MATT: What's the range of that?

2159
02:07:27,774 --> 02:07:32,107
LAURA: It just says a ranged weapon.

2160
02:07:32,107 --> 02:07:35,136
MATT: So whatever your weapon's range is. What's
your weapon's range for your longbow?

2161
02:07:35,136 --> 02:07:39,921
LAURA: That is a really good question. I'm going
to run forward.

2162
02:07:39,921 --> 02:07:42,107
MATT: All right. How far are you going to run?

2163
02:07:42,107 --> 02:07:44,161
LAURA: That looks about right.

2164
02:07:44,161 --> 02:07:45,633
MATT: That's as far as you can go with your
movement.

2165
02:07:45,633 --> 02:07:51,726
LAURA: Yeah. That means I can duck against one of
those walls where the stairs is, right?

2166
02:07:51,726 --> 02:07:52,582
MATT: Yeah.

2167
02:07:52,582 --> 02:07:53,418
LAURA: Okay, cool.

2168
02:07:53,418 --> 02:07:59,154
MATT: It will help you out with that. All right,
so the range of the longbow comes to 150-- yeah,

2169
02:07:59,154 --> 02:08:00,259
you're fine.

2170
02:08:00,259 --> 02:08:05,090
LAURA: So a regular attack.

2171
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:08,628
MATT: Yep, so roll for attack on him.

2172
02:08:08,705 --> 02:08:11,848
LAURA: 17.

2173
02:08:11,848 --> 02:08:14,497
MATT: 17 does hit.

2174
02:08:14,497 --> 02:08:20,321
LAURA: Yes! Okay, so regular attack and then also
thorn attack, right?

2175
02:08:20,501 --> 02:08:24,458
MATT: Yep. So you go ahead and roll damage for the
spell at level three.

2176
02:08:24,458 --> 02:08:45,947
LAURA: And three. 23 plus my regular 14.

2177
02:08:45,947 --> 02:08:51,986
MATT: Nice, so a total of 37? Nice! Is that a
radial explosion?

2178
02:08:51,986 --> 02:08:55,520
LAURA: Yeah, so that should get him and the rider
on the Hail of Thorns part.

2179
02:08:55,520 --> 02:09:02,122
MATT: Good, so the rider itself also takes the
damage. All right, so as you release the arrow,

2180
02:09:02,122 --> 02:09:05,860
(ssch) it arcs through the air, and you see the
wind itself is very strong at this point in the

2181
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:10,803
morning, but you still manage, thanks to your
training and the magical nature of the arrow that

2182
02:09:10,803 --> 02:09:14,879
you fire, strikes true, slamming into the side of
this giant-- and you can see it now, flying, with

2183
02:09:14,879 --> 02:09:21,644
this beaked eagle-like head. This is a griffon.
You've seen them occasionally, usually wild, and

2184
02:09:21,644 --> 02:09:25,384
you stay away from them. This one appears to be
used and harnessed as a mount. However, the arrow

2185
02:09:25,384 --> 02:09:30,573
slams into it and detonates with a spray of
magical thorns. You can see it recoils back, giving

2186
02:09:30,573 --> 02:09:32,265
this (screech) sound.

2187
02:09:32,327 --> 02:09:37,435
LAURA: Oh! Hunter's Mark! I said it. Three
additional damage for Hunter's Mark on that.

2188
02:09:37,435 --> 02:09:45,139
MATT: All right. Great. (laughs) So that's your
bonus action and your first attack. You get a

2189
02:09:45,139 --> 02:09:46,414
second normal attack, too.

2190
02:09:46,414 --> 02:09:48,217
LAURA: Oh, shit! Awesome. Let's do it.

2191
02:09:48,217 --> 02:09:50,014
TRAVIS: It just explodes in thorns. It's not a
fire arrow?

2192
02:09:50,014 --> 02:09:51,118
MATT: No.

2193
02:09:51,118 --> 02:09:53,166
LAURA: That is a 24.

2194
02:09:53,166 --> 02:09:54,592
MATT: 24 definitively hits.

2195
02:09:54,592 --> 02:09:55,475
LAURA: Okay.

2196
02:09:55,475 --> 02:09:56,685
MATT: Against the griffon, as well?

2197
02:09:56,685 --> 02:09:57,545
LAURA: Yes.

2198
02:09:57,545 --> 02:09:58,960
MATT: All right.

2199
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,042
LAURA: Ten.

2200
02:10:00,042 --> 02:10:06,188
MATT: Ten damage, all right. Got it. So as the
griffon's reeling back and trying to flap away, a

2201
02:10:06,309 --> 02:10:10,712
second arrow strikes it in its side. It
screeches again in pain and begins to rise

2202
02:10:10,712 --> 02:10:15,248
up over the actual area. Ooh, I get to use these
again.

2203
02:10:15,248 --> 02:10:17,133
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2204
02:10:17,133 --> 02:10:18,488
MATT: I love it.

2205
02:10:18,488 --> 02:10:19,748
LAURA: I love it!

2206
02:10:19,748 --> 02:10:24,370
MATT: All right. So that ends your turn. I believe
you've moved and done everything else.

2207
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:27,814
All righty.

2208
02:10:27,814 --> 02:10:30,034
LAURA: Oh, I didn't move Trinket at all.

2209
02:10:30,034 --> 02:10:31,315
MATT: You can move Trinket if you want, still.

2210
02:10:31,315 --> 02:10:32,532
LAURA: I want him to be near me.

2211
02:10:32,532 --> 02:10:35,064
MATT: Okay, Trinket moves up to you, ready to
guard angrily.

2212
02:10:35,064 --> 02:10:36,896
LAURA: Yeah, but blocking on the wall.

2213
02:10:36,896 --> 02:10:37,905
MATT: Up in here?

2214
02:10:37,905 --> 02:10:38,889
LAURA: Yeah.

2215
02:10:38,889 --> 02:10:46,428
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Next up,
these guards all shift over to these three

2216
02:10:46,428 --> 02:10:51,452
emplacements over here. You have large, defensive
bolts that are locked into the sides of the ship

2217
02:10:51,452 --> 02:10:56,275
and they go ahead and they reach over in the
barrel and you can see they take one out, and each

2218
02:10:56,275 --> 02:11:00,037
one of these giant bolts has a rope attached to
the end of it, and they start loading it into it,

2219
02:11:00,037 --> 02:11:04,631
pulling back to prepare it for an attack.
It takes their entire turn to do that, but now

2220
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:08,802
they're at the ready to strike out against
whatever they can manage to aim on.

2221
02:11:08,802 --> 02:11:10,970
TRAVIS: Is that also at the front of the ship, is
that what that is?

2222
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:15,973
MATT: One on the front ship there, and one on each
side there. That ends their turn. Vax, you're up.

2223
02:11:15,973 --> 02:11:21,876
LIAM: All right, I'm running up right behind my
sister's shoulder and because of my Assassinate

2224
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:24,621
perk I have advantage on this because they haven't
gone, yeah?

2225
02:11:24,621 --> 02:11:25,889
MATT: Correct.

2226
02:11:25,889 --> 02:11:32,479
LIAM: So I'm going to click my boots of haste as I
come up behind her and dagger-dagger-dagger over

2227
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:41,284
her shoulder. I'll use my brand-new Dagger of
Life-Stealing for the first time. That was a 19,

2228
02:11:41,284 --> 02:11:42,975
which is a critical hit for me.

2229
02:11:42,975 --> 02:11:47,096
MATT: You are at disadvantage on these attacks
because they are beyond your 20 foot

2230
02:11:47,096 --> 02:11:48,601
dagger-throwing range.

2231
02:11:48,601 --> 02:11:55,194
LIAM: Okay, well, I had advantage for Assassinate,
and disadvantage for the distance, so that brings

2232
02:11:55,256 --> 02:12:00,274
me down to even. My first roll was a 19, which is
still a critical hit for me.

2233
02:12:00,274 --> 02:12:02,793
MATT: Is that how it works?

2234
02:12:02,793 --> 02:12:05,176
(laughter)

2235
02:12:05,176 --> 02:12:08,682
MATT: Let me double-check here. You have
advantage-- it's true, you do.

2236
02:12:08,754 --> 02:12:10,392
LIAM: They haven't gone yet.

2237
02:12:10,392 --> 02:12:13,527
MATT: No, it hasn't, you have advantage, it
cancels it out, so yes. That first strike is a

2238
02:12:13,527 --> 02:12:15,429
critical hit on this wyvern right here.

2239
02:12:15,429 --> 02:12:19,819
LIAM: Throwing over my sister's shoulder, so--

2240
02:12:19,819 --> 02:12:21,838
LAURA: Warn me first!

2241
02:12:21,838 --> 02:12:27,598
LIAM: So here we go. Rolling dice in Jersey, it's
wonderful.

2242
02:12:27,598 --> 02:12:29,526
MARISHA: (laughs) Rolling dice in New Jersey.

2243
02:12:29,526 --> 02:12:34,694
LIAM: That makes ten. So that's a 20 for that.

2244
02:12:34,694 --> 02:12:35,720
MATT: All right.

2245
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,487
LIAM: And I'm going to start slinging the other
two daggers.

2246
02:12:37,487 --> 02:12:38,448
MATT: All right.

2247
02:12:38,448 --> 02:12:42,771
LIAM: First one probably misses, it's a 14.

2248
02:12:42,771 --> 02:12:44,667
MATT: A 14 against the wyvern?

2249
02:12:44,667 --> 02:12:47,837
LIAM: Well, I don't know, do these all get
advantage?

2250
02:12:47,837 --> 02:12:54,254
MATT: Technically, that's another good question.
Huh. Look at this.

2251
02:12:54,254 --> 02:12:56,718
LIAM: All three are before they go.

2252
02:12:56,718 --> 02:13:01,408
MATT: It's true, that's why I'm thinking probably,
I'm pretty sure you can get advantage on... yeah,

2253
02:13:01,408 --> 02:13:04,267
on attack rolls against any creatures not in
combat yet, so yeah.

2254
02:13:04,267 --> 02:13:06,935
LIAM: All right, so then actually that was a 20.

2255
02:13:06,935 --> 02:13:08,852
MATT: All right, that definitely hits.

2256
02:13:08,852 --> 02:13:16,077
LIAM: Okay. That is an eight and the third dagger
goes (wa-shing) right over Vex's

2257
02:13:16,146 --> 02:13:20,240
shoulder for a 27.

2258
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:22,749
MATT: All right.

2259
02:13:22,749 --> 02:13:29,591
LIAM: This one is the poison dagger of course, so
that is ten of damage and then

2260
02:13:29,591 --> 02:13:32,354
it's a DC of 15 for poison.

2261
02:13:32,354 --> 02:13:40,779
MATT: All right. The dagger strikes true, you are
uncertain if it's had an effect unfortunately. At

2262
02:13:40,779 --> 02:13:47,818
this distance, it's hard to tell its physical
reaction to the impact. However, the dagger seems

2263
02:13:47,818 --> 02:13:54,532
to be making definite damaged appearances to its
physical exterior and you see it recoiling from

2264
02:13:54,532 --> 02:13:57,781
the attacks and begins to once again fly up as
well to try and get out of range.

2265
02:13:57,781 --> 02:13:59,059
LIAM: I'm happy.

2266
02:13:59,059 --> 02:14:05,309
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. It's now the
griffon's turn, griffon and the griffon rider.

2267
02:14:05,309 --> 02:14:06,865
LAURA: Oh no.

2268
02:14:06,865 --> 02:14:13,772
MATT: The griffon rider and the griffon are going
to swoop down, half its movement, it's going to

2269
02:14:13,959 --> 02:14:16,925
attempt to grapple against that guard.

2270
02:14:16,925 --> 02:14:17,948
MARISHA: Grappling?

2271
02:14:17,948 --> 02:14:18,991
TALIESIN: Grapple-grapple.

2272
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:20,666
LAURA AND MARISHA: Oh no.

2273
02:14:20,666 --> 02:14:21,727
TRAVIS: That the captain?

2274
02:14:21,727 --> 02:14:22,755
MATT: Who fails his check. Grabs--

2275
02:14:22,755 --> 02:14:24,135
MARISHA: Oh no, he's going to throw him over the
edge.

2276
02:14:24,135 --> 02:14:25,695
MATT: Grabs this guard into its claws--

2277
02:14:25,695 --> 02:14:27,299
LIAM: Not Simon.

2278
02:14:27,299 --> 02:14:29,183
MATT: And then flies up and over this side--

2279
02:14:29,183 --> 02:14:30,710
MARISHA: He's going to toss his ass over the
edge!

2280
02:14:30,710 --> 02:14:31,928
MATT: And he's going to release it.

2281
02:14:31,928 --> 02:14:33,865
TRAVIS: Oh, you are shitting me!

2282
02:14:33,865 --> 02:14:35,488
MARISHA: Does someone have a reaction?

2283
02:14:35,488 --> 02:14:37,847
MATT: He's going to attempt-- if you have
something crazy.

2284
02:14:37,847 --> 02:14:40,507
MARISHA: Can someone do anything? Reaction?

2285
02:14:40,507 --> 02:14:47,394
MATT: The guard misses-- or fails to hold on tight
with his last reaction to try and grapple back.

2286
02:14:47,394 --> 02:14:48,863
TALIESIN: That's such dick.

2287
02:14:48,863 --> 02:14:53,653
MATT: The guard, you watch as the griffon swoops
down, grabs him, both of its claws and talons

2288
02:14:53,653 --> 02:14:57,950
wrapping around his shoulders, lifting him up, and
chucking him over the side, you hear him scream

2289
02:14:57,950 --> 02:15:00,462
(ahhh) as he vanishes.

2290
02:15:00,527 --> 02:15:03,489
LAURA: As a reaction, can we fricking tie
ourselves down to the boat?

2291
02:15:03,489 --> 02:15:07,047
MATT: You have no ropes immediately around you,
you have to go to the side.

2292
02:15:07,127 --> 02:15:08,614
LAURA: I do, I have the rope of--

2293
02:15:08,614 --> 02:15:10,009
MATT: You have nothing to tie it to at the
moment.

2294
02:15:10,009 --> 02:15:11,090
LAURA: Shit. Trinket.

2295
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:14,217
MATT: You have the pegs all on the side here where
the ropes attach to, so you guys could do that.

2296
02:15:14,290 --> 02:15:15,629
MARISHA: I have some Grasping Vines?

2297
02:15:15,629 --> 02:15:18,709
ASHLEY: We could just attach it to all of
ourselves, and where we go one, we go all. If they

2298
02:15:18,709 --> 02:15:20,094
take one, they take all of us.

2299
02:15:20,094 --> 02:15:23,472
MATT: And with the last bit of the griffon's
flight movement, that was then there.

2300
02:15:23,472 --> 02:15:24,928
MARISHA: It would make it--

2301
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:26,485
ASHLEY: It wouldn't be able to lift all of us.

2302
02:15:26,485 --> 02:15:29,719
MARISHA: Well, it would make it difficult, he
would have to break against strength checks

2303
02:15:29,719 --> 02:15:31,103
against Grog and stuff, yeah.

2304
02:15:31,103 --> 02:15:40,476
MATT: So there is the griffon's current position
on its turn. That ends there. Tiberius and Grog

2305
02:15:40,476 --> 02:15:41,781
both go.

2306
02:15:41,781 --> 02:15:46,404
ORION: Okay, I'm going to move over here.

2307
02:15:46,404 --> 02:15:51,451
MATT: Okay, so one, two, three, four, five, six.
That's as far as you can get there.

2308
02:15:51,451 --> 02:15:54,952
ORION: I'm still in range of that guy, right?

2309
02:15:54,952 --> 02:15:55,977
MATT: Yeah.

2310
02:15:55,977 --> 02:16:03,796
ORION: Good. I'm going to use Telekinesis to lift
the rider off and chuck him off.

2311
02:16:03,796 --> 02:16:07,497
MATT: Go ahead and make your check plus five with
your modifier.

2312
02:16:07,678 --> 02:16:17,414
ORION: So that's-- no, but it's still okay. That's
16 plus my this thing, that's 19?

2313
02:16:17,414 --> 02:16:19,022
LIAM: Come on, Tiberius.

2314
02:16:19,022 --> 02:16:26,511
MATT: So the rider, which as you look over you can
see appears to be small and halfling-like in

2315
02:16:26,511 --> 02:16:31,496
physical form-- you reach over with your
Telekinesis spell and concentrate. The entity

2316
02:16:31,496 --> 02:16:36,569
that's gripping onto it and holding the spear
all of a sudden gets lifted up and

2317
02:16:36,569 --> 02:16:38,382
then flung off the side.

2318
02:16:38,382 --> 02:16:48,977
ORION: And I turn to the wyvern and I go,
(speaking Draconic) and I, in dragon-speak or

2319
02:16:48,977 --> 02:16:51,052
Draconic, whatever, I say--

2320
02:16:51,052 --> 02:16:52,384
MARISHA: You say, "Bad dragon!"

2321
02:16:52,384 --> 02:16:54,567
ORION: Fight with me or be free.

2322
02:16:54,567 --> 02:16:56,747
LAURA: Or be free? And be free.

2323
02:16:56,747 --> 02:16:59,071
ORION: Or. He can, meaning--

2324
02:16:59,071 --> 02:17:00,224
LAURA: Oh, I get it.

2325
02:17:00,224 --> 02:17:02,122
MARISHA: Or go peace out.

2326
02:17:02,122 --> 02:17:03,113
LAURA: Okay.

2327
02:17:03,113 --> 02:17:04,127
ORION: Right.

2328
02:17:04,127 --> 02:17:05,958
LIAM: It all sounded like Enya to me.

2329
02:17:05,958 --> 02:17:11,655
MATT: Make-- I'll say for this one, make an animal
handling roll.

2330
02:17:11,655 --> 02:17:13,098
ASHLEY: Come on.

2331
02:17:13,098 --> 02:17:15,149
LAURA: Natural 20.

2332
02:17:15,149 --> 02:17:19,534
ASHLEY: Advantage because you're a dragonborn.

2333
02:17:19,534 --> 02:17:20,675
ORION: Nope.

2334
02:17:20,675 --> 02:17:22,337
LIAM: Come on, Tibber-hoods.

2335
02:17:22,337 --> 02:17:23,590
ORION: Like eight, yeah.

2336
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:24,703
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

2337
02:17:24,703 --> 02:17:25,989
MARISHA: Did you have disadvantage?

2338
02:17:25,989 --> 02:17:28,589
ORION: No, I had advantage.

2339
02:17:28,589 --> 02:17:29,649
MARISHA: Oh.

2340
02:17:29,649 --> 02:17:38,161
MATT: Yeah. So this halfling or gnomish entity is
now falling out of the air. That ends Tiberius's

2341
02:17:38,161 --> 02:17:39,844
turn. Grog, what's up?

2342
02:17:39,844 --> 02:17:47,313
TRAVIS: I turn to the group and say, Make sure
someone guards the box in case it's a distraction.

2343
02:17:47,313 --> 02:17:54,293
And then I rage. And I would like to run to the
front of the ship where the captain was, as far as

2344
02:17:54,293 --> 02:17:55,310
I can--

2345
02:17:55,310 --> 02:17:56,532
MATT: The captain's right here.

2346
02:17:56,532 --> 02:17:57,328
TRAVIS: Oh, the captain's there?

2347
02:17:57,328 --> 02:17:58,374
MATT: Yes, the back of the ship--

2348
02:17:58,374 --> 02:17:59,478
LAURA: That was the guard.

2349
02:17:59,478 --> 02:18:01,600
MATT: The guard got flung off the side, the
captain's still out there holding on to the--

2350
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:03,004
TRAVIS: I will run to the front crystal.

2351
02:18:03,004 --> 02:18:04,241
MATT: Okay.

2352
02:18:04,241 --> 02:18:07,901
TRAVIS: If I can get there. It's 40 feet is how
far I can go.

2353
02:18:07,901 --> 02:18:10,527
MATT: 40 feet is right there.

2354
02:18:10,527 --> 02:18:12,377
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch. Okay.

2355
02:18:12,377 --> 02:18:15,268
MATT: Well, you raged as a bonus action, you could
use your action to dash and go the rest of the

2356
02:18:15,268 --> 02:18:17,210
distance, doubling your movement.

2357
02:18:17,210 --> 02:18:18,893
TRAVIS: I wanted to tie myself to something,
though.

2358
02:18:18,893 --> 02:18:20,164
MATT: Okay.

2359
02:18:20,164 --> 02:18:23,117
LAURA: You could run to the side and tie yourself
to--

2360
02:18:23,117 --> 02:18:25,172
TALIESIN: What is that thing at the very front of
the ship?

2361
02:18:25,172 --> 02:18:29,424
MATT: Right there? It's another one of these
ballistas. They've all been set, this one has been

2362
02:18:29,424 --> 02:18:32,271
set to fire, just the person who was currently
helming it got chucked off the side.

2363
02:18:32,271 --> 02:18:34,528
MARISHA: Ooh, you're the shooty guy.

2364
02:18:34,596 --> 02:18:37,144
TRAVIS: Is there a railing on the side of the ship
at all?

2365
02:18:37,144 --> 02:18:39,313
MATT: There is a railing, it's about waist-high.

2366
02:18:39,313 --> 02:18:42,474
LAURA: And there's pegs to tie yourself to on the
sides.

2367
02:18:42,474 --> 02:18:43,861
MATT: Yeah, each one of these dots.

2368
02:18:43,861 --> 02:18:47,911
TRAVIS: Okay, I have a hundred feet of chain. Can
I take the chain out of the bag of holding, wrap

2369
02:18:47,911 --> 02:18:51,882
it around my wrist, and wrap it around the
railing, and then that'll be all I do.

2370
02:18:51,882 --> 02:18:53,708
Can I do that?

2371
02:18:53,708 --> 02:18:59,096
MATT: Yeah? With your movement, you can get to
there, unless you wanted to instead head

2372
02:18:59,096 --> 02:19:00,184
over here and--

2373
02:19:00,184 --> 02:19:01,224
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll do that.

2374
02:19:01,224 --> 02:19:04,062
MATT: So instead of going further up that route,
you go ahead and wrap the chain around there,

2375
02:19:04,062 --> 02:19:07,859
sure. Chain around your wrist, you tangle it in
with your Chain of Returning. You go ahead and

2376
02:19:07,859 --> 02:19:13,310
take the chain and wrap it around the side of the
peg and pull it taut. That's your turn. All right.

2377
02:19:13,310 --> 02:19:15,483
That ends Grog's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

2378
02:19:15,483 --> 02:19:24,626
MARISHA: I'm going to move my speed over
here-ish.

2379
02:19:24,626 --> 02:19:25,834
MATT: All right.

2380
02:19:25,834 --> 02:19:31,633
MARISHA: And then would you say I'm 60 feet,
within range of that guy?

2381
02:19:31,633 --> 02:19:34,605
MATT: Oh yeah. You're within 25, 30 feet of him.

2382
02:19:34,605 --> 02:19:39,587
MARISHA: Oh, am I? Well, let me back up a bit,
then. Just right-- Oh, I can walk across that.

2383
02:19:39,587 --> 02:19:40,633
MATT: Yeah.

2384
02:19:40,633 --> 02:19:41,637
MARISHA: Oh, fun.

2385
02:19:41,637 --> 02:19:47,152
MATT: It's a wooden lattice basically, it's mostly
covered. It's what they remove when they're

2386
02:19:47,152 --> 02:19:48,808
putting large cargo in the ship.

2387
02:19:48,808 --> 02:19:51,836
MARISHA: Right. Gotcha. And there's still a rider
on that guy?

2388
02:19:51,836 --> 02:19:53,832
MATT: Yes, there's a rider on all of them.

2389
02:19:53,832 --> 02:20:02,330
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to cast Polymorph on
that wyvern, and I turn him into a bunny rabbit.

2390
02:20:02,330 --> 02:20:06,309
TRAVIS: (laughs) You're going to kill a bunny.

2391
02:20:06,309 --> 02:20:08,853
SAM: No, he won't die, he won't die.

2392
02:20:08,853 --> 02:20:10,363
MARISHA: Oh, I am going to kill a bunny.

2393
02:20:10,363 --> 02:20:11,464
LAURA: Six hit points?

2394
02:20:11,464 --> 02:20:12,584
ASHLEY: The guy riding him's going to be like
ahhh!

2395
02:20:12,647 --> 02:20:14,700
TALIESIN: That is the least innocent thing she's
killed in this game so far.

2396
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:16,523
TRAVIS: That is an Acme cartoon waiting to
happen.

2397
02:20:16,523 --> 02:20:18,985
MARISHA: That is true. I just think it's going to
be funny. That's pretty much what I thought.

2398
02:20:18,985 --> 02:20:21,245
LIAM: Buck, buck. Thanks, Easter Bunny!

2399
02:20:21,245 --> 02:20:23,045
MATT: All right, so what's the DC on that?

2400
02:20:23,045 --> 02:20:26,650
MARISHA: I guess make a wisdom saving throw-- the
wyvern has to make a wisdom saving throw.

2401
02:20:26,650 --> 02:20:31,498
MATT: What's your DC on that? Your spell DC.

2402
02:20:31,498 --> 02:20:32,786
MARISHA: 18.

2403
02:20:32,786 --> 02:20:38,637
MATT: Into what creature?

2404
02:20:38,691 --> 02:20:40,056
MARISHA: A wyvern.

2405
02:20:40,056 --> 02:20:41,719
A bunny.

2406
02:20:41,719 --> 02:20:43,457
MATT: Okay, so. So. (laughs)

2407
02:20:43,457 --> 02:20:45,410
MARISHA: Or you know what, you know what would be
funnier?

2408
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:47,088
TRAVIS: Stick with the bunny, the bunny's good.

2409
02:20:47,088 --> 02:20:49,103
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll stick with the bunny.

2410
02:20:49,103 --> 02:20:55,569
MATT: The wyvern turns into a bunny
rabbit from underneath its rider and goes (squeak)

2411
02:20:55,569 --> 02:21:00,564
and then plummets, the rider of which
begins to fall as well--

2412
02:21:00,564 --> 02:21:01,867
MARISHA: Bye!

2413
02:21:01,867 --> 02:21:04,128
MATT: -- immediately tossing a grappling hook as it
falls.

2414
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:06,450
MARISHA: He came prepared.

2415
02:21:06,450 --> 02:21:08,107
LIAM: He's falling so slowly.

2416
02:21:08,107 --> 02:21:12,807
LAURA: That's awesome!

2417
02:21:12,807 --> 02:21:15,017
MARISHA: Thanks. That was my turn.

2418
02:21:15,017 --> 02:21:16,013
TRAVIS: That was slick.

2419
02:21:16,013 --> 02:21:18,595
MATT: All right, that brings us-- So now the
wyverns' turn.

2420
02:21:18,595 --> 02:21:20,489
LAURA: Where did the music go?

2421
02:21:20,489 --> 02:21:22,741
TRAVIS: Why has the music died??

2422
02:21:22,741 --> 02:21:29,411
ALL: (sing battle music)

2423
02:21:29,411 --> 02:21:31,662
MATT: It's coming, guys, don't worry.

2424
02:21:31,662 --> 02:21:34,521
LAURA: (laughs) There it was.

2425
02:21:34,521 --> 02:21:45,596
MATT: This wyvern turns and dives down to catch
its rider, lift it back up onto its back, but it

2426
02:21:45,596 --> 02:21:51,058
uses its entire turn doing so. Wasted their turn
on that element.

2427
02:21:51,058 --> 02:21:54,286
ORION: Wait, what?

2428
02:21:54,286 --> 02:21:56,475
MARISHA and SAM: The wyvern caught his rider.

2429
02:21:56,475 --> 02:21:57,792
ORION: How is that possible?

2430
02:21:57,792 --> 02:21:59,564
LAURA: It happened in like
second-second-second-second.

2431
02:21:59,564 --> 02:22:04,429
MATT: You threw it off the side, and for the
wyvern's turn immediately it dove down, caught the

2432
02:22:04,429 --> 02:22:08,376
rider, and it helped it back onto its back, but
that took its entire turn to do that.

2433
02:22:08,452 --> 02:22:09,519
TRAVIS: Bad wyvern.

2434
02:22:09,519 --> 02:22:11,331
ORION: Okay.

2435
02:22:11,331 --> 02:22:13,037
TALIESIN: But well-trained.

2436
02:22:13,037 --> 02:22:14,237
TRAVIS: Bad. Wyvern.

2437
02:22:14,237 --> 02:22:16,642
MATT: This wyvern is plummeting as a bunny rabbit
now through the air. It's going to attempt

2438
02:22:16,642 --> 02:22:18,578
to make its saving throw.

2439
02:22:18,578 --> 02:22:19,698
TRAVIS: Fail, fail.

2440
02:22:19,698 --> 02:22:20,683
MARISHA: Fail!

2441
02:22:20,683 --> 02:22:23,770
MATT: Does Polymorph allow a saving throw every
round if it's against its will?

2442
02:22:23,770 --> 02:22:24,597
TRAVIS: Fail.

2443
02:22:24,597 --> 02:22:26,951
LAURA: I don't think-- I remember you had to be
damaged, right?

2444
02:22:26,951 --> 02:22:28,638
TRAVIS: Bunny go splat, bunny go die.

2445
02:22:28,638 --> 02:22:30,507
MARISHA: Actually, yeah, I think--

2446
02:22:30,507 --> 02:22:32,048
ASHLEY: Bunny go bye-bye.

2447
02:22:32,048 --> 02:22:33,344
TRAVIS: Thumper's toast.

2448
02:22:33,344 --> 02:22:39,234
MARISHA: It lasts for the duration or until the
target drops to zero hit points or dies.

2449
02:22:39,234 --> 02:22:40,480
MATT: Yeah, so no.

2450
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:43,114
MARISHA: He just, you know, is a falling bunny.

2451
02:22:43,114 --> 02:22:47,187
MATT: He's a falling bunny. That is going to be
one dead wyvern.

2452
02:22:47,187 --> 02:22:49,782
LAURA: That's amazing. Everything's falling.

2453
02:22:49,782 --> 02:22:52,688
MARISHA: Will you let me know when he hits the
ground, when he falls?

2454
02:22:52,688 --> 02:22:53,587
MATT: I will, don't worry.

2455
02:22:53,587 --> 02:22:54,618
SAM: Well it's the ocean, right?

2456
02:22:54,618 --> 02:22:55,389
MATT: Yeah.

2457
02:22:55,389 --> 02:22:56,658
TRAVIS: You'll hear the guts splat out of it.

2458
02:22:56,658 --> 02:22:57,693
SAM: Might end up not hitting...

2459
02:22:57,693 --> 02:23:01,456
MATT: Terminal velocity for a bunny rabbit. I have
to consider this as a DM now. This is a thing in

2460
02:23:01,456 --> 02:23:02,241
my existence.

2461
02:23:02,241 --> 02:23:06,236
MARISHA: Yeah, it's the same. You throw a penny,
you throw a cow off the Empire State Building,

2462
02:23:06,290 --> 02:23:07,660
they'll both fall at the same time.

2463
02:23:07,660 --> 02:23:12,115
ASHLEY: How high up are we, and how much does the
bunny weigh?

2464
02:23:12,115 --> 02:23:13,651
MATT: It's hard to tell, you cannot make any
details--

2465
02:23:13,651 --> 02:23:14,844
ASHLEY: Let's do the math.

2466
02:23:14,844 --> 02:23:20,370
MATT: You're so far above the ocean that you can
barely make out any details of it, and what you

2467
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:25,662
can see is so fine in the distance you gather...
you're a long, long way up.

2468
02:23:25,662 --> 02:23:28,195
LIAM: Getting flashes of Holy Grail here.

2469
02:23:28,195 --> 02:23:31,145
MATT: Exactly. So the grappling hook (woo tink)
onto the side here.

2470
02:23:31,145 --> 02:23:32,717
LAURA: Oh no, it's that jerk.

2471
02:23:32,717 --> 02:23:35,595
MATT: The rope swings, and this guy spends his
turn getting up onto the side of the boat there

2472
02:23:35,595 --> 02:23:46,684
and that's his turn. Next, this wyvern here is
going to swoop down. As it does, its rider leaps

2473
02:23:46,684 --> 02:23:57,463
off, landing right there. The wyvern comes over
here and is going to make attacks on you.

2474
02:23:57,463 --> 02:23:58,414
LAURA: No!

2475
02:23:58,414 --> 02:24:05,564
MATT: First it comes back with its bite. It has no
arms, its arms are its wings, it has taloned feet.

2476
02:24:05,564 --> 02:24:12,155
Comes down and bites at you with its giant toothy
maw. That's going to be a 25

2477
02:24:12,222 --> 02:24:13,641
to hit with its bite.

2478
02:24:13,641 --> 02:24:14,954
LAURA: Fudge.

2479
02:24:14,954 --> 02:24:20,189
MATT: So you take 13 points of piercing damage.

2480
02:24:20,189 --> 02:24:21,393
LAURA: All right.

2481
02:24:21,393 --> 02:24:31,002
MATT: It's not going to use its claws, because
instead, as it brings its claws up in a rearing

2482
02:24:31,002 --> 02:24:36,006
position, its tail whips underneath it with this
gnarled pointed stinger at you--

2483
02:24:36,006 --> 02:24:37,547
LAURA: At me still?

2484
02:24:37,547 --> 02:24:40,824
MATT: As you're the one that shot an exploding
arrow at its friend.

2485
02:24:40,824 --> 02:24:41,941
LAURA: Oh, all right.

2486
02:24:41,941 --> 02:24:47,189
MATT: This is going to be-- that's a 20 to hit.

2487
02:24:47,189 --> 02:24:54,611
LAURA: Okay, so my armor class is 19 but I'm
wearing a plus two Ring of Protection.

2488
02:24:54,611 --> 02:24:56,546
MATT: Right, but that's with your--

2489
02:24:56,546 --> 02:24:57,786
LAURA: Is that with the plus two ring?

2490
02:24:57,786 --> 02:24:59,070
MATT: That's with the plus two, yeah.

2491
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:00,761
LAURA: So it hits me then.

2492
02:25:00,761 --> 02:25:03,852
TALIESIN: I like that little dance, looks quite
nice.

2493
02:25:03,906 --> 02:25:11,185
MATT: So, for that... You take ten points of
piercing damage, and I need you to make a DC 15

2494
02:25:11,185 --> 02:25:16,291
constitution saving throw, as the stinger at the
end of its tail pierces you in the side of your

2495
02:25:16,291 --> 02:25:19,304
torso. And as it does you can feel the venom pulse
in the inside of your skin.

2496
02:25:19,304 --> 02:25:20,396
LAURA: So I have to beat 15?

2497
02:25:20,396 --> 02:25:21,804
MATT: Yeah.

2498
02:25:21,804 --> 02:25:23,597
MARISHA: You got this!

2499
02:25:23,597 --> 02:25:26,003
TRAVIS: Confidently. Roll that shit.

2500
02:25:26,003 --> 02:25:31,892
MATT: No? As the poison pulses through your system
you feel your muscles seize up with this horrible,

2501
02:25:31,892 --> 02:25:33,663
painful, burning sensation.

2502
02:25:33,663 --> 02:25:40,172
LAURA: (exaggerated pain noises)

2503
02:25:40,343 --> 02:25:42,145
TRAVIS: Buffy.

2504
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:43,969
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah.

2505
02:25:43,969 --> 02:25:49,487
MATT: You take... 26 points of poison damage.

2506
02:25:49,487 --> 02:25:51,165
LAURA: Holy fudge, dude!

2507
02:25:51,165 --> 02:25:52,107
TRAVIS: How much? 26?

2508
02:25:52,107 --> 02:25:52,965
LAURA: 26!

2509
02:25:52,965 --> 02:25:54,245
MATT: 26 points of poison damage.

2510
02:25:54,245 --> 02:25:55,308
MARISHA: Ouch. Ouchies.

2511
02:25:55,308 --> 02:25:56,730
LAURA: I've got to start doing math now.

2512
02:25:56,730 --> 02:26:02,693
MATT: The individual that hopped off of it, now
you can see is a halfling; dressed in dark

2513
02:26:02,693 --> 02:26:09,362
leather, face is obscured, pulls a longbow out.
And pulls out two arrows at once, pulls back and

2514
02:26:09,424 --> 02:26:10,906
(tssk) releases them.

2515
02:26:10,906 --> 02:26:11,916
MARISHA: Oh.

2516
02:26:11,916 --> 02:26:17,264
MATT: One is going for you, Keyleth. The other is
going for Trinket.

2517
02:26:17,264 --> 02:26:19,889
MARISHA: These guys got skills.

2518
02:26:19,889 --> 02:26:23,774
MATT: That is a 22 versus you, Keyleth.

2519
02:26:23,774 --> 02:26:24,843
MARISHA: Yeah.

2520
02:26:24,843 --> 02:26:27,503
MATT: And a 20 versus Trinket.

2521
02:26:27,503 --> 02:26:28,509
LAURA: He's got 20.

2522
02:26:28,509 --> 02:26:31,319
MATT: All right.

2523
02:26:31,319 --> 02:26:32,994
LAURA: Oh no!

2524
02:26:32,994 --> 02:26:35,778
MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage.

2525
02:26:35,778 --> 02:26:37,109
MARISHA: Okay.

2526
02:26:37,109 --> 02:26:39,405
MATT: Trinket takes five points of piercing
damage.

2527
02:26:39,405 --> 02:26:42,684
LAURA: Okay okay okay... okay...

2528
02:26:42,684 --> 02:26:48,332
MATT: That ends their turn. All right, brings it
to Percy.

2529
02:26:48,332 --> 02:26:51,453
MARISHA: Go Percy, go Percy, go!

2530
02:26:51,453 --> 02:26:55,591
TALIESIN: How far away am I from that wyvern
that's currently attacking everybody?

2531
02:26:55,591 --> 02:26:56,756
MATT: Right there?

2532
02:26:56,756 --> 02:26:57,594
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2533
02:26:57,594 --> 02:27:01,468
MATT: You're right here, so you're about-- roughly
45 feet from him.

2534
02:27:01,468 --> 02:27:07,501
TRAVIS: (sings) Shave and a haircut.

2535
02:27:07,501 --> 02:27:13,032
TALIESIN: This will be funny. Okay, I'm going to
back up and sit down against the back wall of the ship.

2536
02:27:13,106 --> 02:27:14,752
MATT: Okay. Against the doorway.

2537
02:27:14,752 --> 02:27:19,201
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out the biggest gun I
have. So, I'm going to pull out Bad News.

2538
02:27:19,201 --> 02:27:20,529
TRAVIS: Yes! Fuck yes!

2539
02:27:20,529 --> 02:27:25,750
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down. I'm going to take
aim and I'm going to do-- I'm going to spend a

2540
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:30,162
Grit, and try and take a wing shot at this.

2541
02:27:30,225 --> 02:27:31,881
MATT: At this wyvern here?

2542
02:27:31,881 --> 02:27:32,771
TALIESIN: Yes.

2543
02:27:32,771 --> 02:27:33,749
MATT: All right.

2544
02:27:33,749 --> 02:27:34,950
MARISHA: What's a wing shot?

2545
02:27:34,950 --> 02:27:35,976
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see if it works.

2546
02:27:35,976 --> 02:27:36,996
LAURA: Trying to shoot the wing.

2547
02:27:36,996 --> 02:27:37,915
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him in the wing.

2548
02:27:37,915 --> 02:27:44,924
MARISHA: That sounds awesome. Oh. You mean
literally. Right. Sure. Yeah. (laughs)

2549
02:27:44,924 --> 02:27:46,046
TALIESIN: 18?

2550
02:27:46,046 --> 02:27:47,183
MATT: Hits.

2551
02:27:47,183 --> 02:27:48,569
SAM: Just winged him.

2552
02:27:48,569 --> 02:28:04,264
TALIESIN: Okay. 19, 20-- Really? Where's my d12s,
I was not prepared for this. Here we go. 14 points

2553
02:28:04,264 --> 02:28:07,932
of damage, and he has to make a constitution
saving throw.

2554
02:28:08,099 --> 02:28:12,037
SAM: We're just letting that guard die, right?
We're not going to try to...

2555
02:28:12,037 --> 02:28:13,792
LAURA: I didn't realize we could save him.

2556
02:28:13,792 --> 02:28:14,842
TALIESIN: 23.

2557
02:28:14,842 --> 02:28:15,928
MATT: No. Fails that.

2558
02:28:15,928 --> 02:28:19,140
TALIESIN: Okay. That wyvern drops hard, 20 feet.

2559
02:28:19,140 --> 02:28:24,764
MATT: All right. So that wyvern who is roughly
about ten feet up, you shoot it in the wing (psh!).

2560
02:28:24,831 --> 02:28:27,676
It blows a big old hole in the side of its
leathery wing. As you do, the impact sends its

2561
02:28:27,676 --> 02:28:32,080
wing arm crumbling behind it. It spins
uncontrollably in the space and then plummets to

2562
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:36,940
the ground, on its back, just reaching and
scrambling trying to get back up. So it's

2563
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:38,659
currently prone on the ground.

2564
02:28:38,659 --> 02:28:40,071
TALIESIN: Boom! All right, thank you.

2565
02:28:40,071 --> 02:28:40,959
MATT: No worries.

2566
02:28:40,959 --> 02:28:42,038
LAURA: Deal with it.

2567
02:28:42,038 --> 02:28:43,106
TALIESIN: And I reload.

2568
02:28:43,106 --> 02:28:44,813
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

2569
02:28:44,813 --> 02:28:54,608
SAM: Ah! I'll take a few steps towards the action
and I'll cast (sings) Bigby's Hand, Bigby's

2570
02:28:54,608 --> 02:28:59,740
Hand, you know it, shamone. On the griffon.

2571
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:01,193
MATT: All right.

2572
02:29:01,193 --> 02:29:03,859
SAM: Is he above the boat or just above the
ocean?

2573
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:07,816
MATT: Currently above the ocean, just near the
edge of the boat.

2574
02:29:07,816 --> 02:29:13,819
SAM: Can I use Forceful Hand, it says I can push.
Do you think I can... twist?

2575
02:29:13,819 --> 02:29:15,073
LAURA: Stop it!

2576
02:29:15,073 --> 02:29:16,263
ORION: Sorry.

2577
02:29:16,263 --> 02:29:17,838
MATT: You know what, you could.

2578
02:29:17,838 --> 02:29:20,254
SAM: So I'm going to dump him over.

2579
02:29:20,254 --> 02:29:23,687
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a check with your
bonus.

2580
02:29:23,687 --> 02:29:26,372
SAM: Oh, and this is all through the Hand Cone of
Clarity. Of course.

2581
02:29:26,372 --> 02:29:28,432
MATT: Right, right. So go ahead and roll and add
five.

2582
02:29:28,432 --> 02:29:31,900
SAM: 19 plus five, 24.

2583
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:39,575
MATT: 19... plus three. So the griffon, all of a
sudden, there's this giant, shimmering Bigby's Hand. As

2584
02:29:39,575 --> 02:29:45,022
you reach out, this gargantuan version of a
Scanlan fist comes rocketing through the sky, the

2585
02:29:45,074 --> 02:29:49,310
fingers unraveling, clutching the griffon. Its
wings seemingly pulled up and crunched for a

2586
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:54,455
second as it is suddenly (shft) lifted. Its rider
who is holding on to the reins in the front is now

2587
02:29:54,455 --> 02:29:59,119
dangling, and going to attempt to try and hold
on... and rolls a three.

2588
02:29:59,119 --> 02:30:01,706
(cheering)

2589
02:30:01,706 --> 02:30:05,665
MATT: The rider immediately plummets, falls right
towards the edge of the ship.

2590
02:30:05,737 --> 02:30:09,217
LAURA: Hits the railing. Breaks his back.

2591
02:30:09,217 --> 02:30:13,622
MATT: Makes an acrobatics check and manages to
reduce the damage and land on its feet, however it

2592
02:30:13,622 --> 02:30:18,277
does still take nine points of falling damage.

2593
02:30:18,277 --> 02:30:20,257
TRAVIS: Is he a halfling as well?

2594
02:30:20,323 --> 02:30:24,238
MATT: No, this actually seems a very lithe,
elven-looking individual. Like very thin form,

2595
02:30:24,238 --> 02:30:30,194
face and body all covered, appears to be female.
From best you can tell, just from the

2596
02:30:30,194 --> 02:30:31,119
physicality.

2597
02:30:31,119 --> 02:30:32,437
LAURA: She's going down.

2598
02:30:32,437 --> 02:30:34,284
SAM: I'm also going to inspire Vex.

2599
02:30:34,284 --> 02:30:38,473
With just a-- just for her archery skills.

2600
02:30:38,473 --> 02:30:40,379
MATT: Go for it.

2601
02:30:40,379 --> 02:30:50,685
SAM: Okay. (sings) Elvish people in the ship
tonight, everybody just have a good fight.

2602
02:30:50,685 --> 02:30:53,017
(laughter)

2603
02:30:53,017 --> 02:30:56,250
MATT: All right, you get a d10 inspiration dice
for it, for your use.

2604
02:30:56,250 --> 02:30:57,162
LAURA: Yeah!

2605
02:30:57,162 --> 02:30:58,442
ASHLEY: Yeah!

2606
02:30:58,442 --> 02:31:02,077
MATT: So that ends your turn. Pike, you're up.

2607
02:31:02,077 --> 02:31:03,871
ASHLEY: Okay, how long is the ship?

2608
02:31:03,871 --> 02:31:05,750
MATT: The full length of it?

2609
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:06,926
LAURA: (laughs) Show him.

2610
02:31:06,926 --> 02:31:10,095
ASHLEY: Just so you know what I'm looking at right
now, I'll show you again.

2611
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:11,382
MATT: (laughs) This ship?

2612
02:31:11,382 --> 02:31:12,323
ASHLEY: This ship right here.

2613
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:13,337
MATT: This ship right here?

2614
02:31:13,471 --> 02:31:14,268
ASHLEY: Yeah. That one.

2615
02:31:14,338 --> 02:31:15,804
MATT: Sure. Okay.

2616
02:31:15,983 --> 02:31:16,927
ASHLEY: No.

2617
02:31:16,927 --> 02:31:24,690
MATT: I'd say it'd be about 130 feet in-- or 140
feet.

2618
02:31:24,690 --> 02:31:33,235
ASHLEY: Okay, so would you say, maybe this area
would be about like 60 feet?

2619
02:31:33,235 --> 02:31:35,394
MATT: 60 foot radius, you mean?

2620
02:31:35,394 --> 02:31:36,598
ASHLEY: Yeah, how-- where would--

2621
02:31:36,598 --> 02:31:38,906
MATT: A 60 foot radius for you would be... right
here.

2622
02:31:38,906 --> 02:31:39,866
ASHLEY: Okay.

2623
02:31:39,866 --> 02:31:40,849
MATT: Like this around you.

2624
02:31:40,849 --> 02:31:42,710
ASHLEY: Okay.

2625
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:45,004
LAURA: But you can move.

2626
02:31:45,004 --> 02:31:51,251
ASHLEY: I would like to reach down-- stay where I
am-- and touch the floor of the ship,

2627
02:31:51,251 --> 02:31:54,495
and cast Hallow?

2628
02:31:54,495 --> 02:31:56,109
MATT: Hallow? Okay.

2629
02:31:56,109 --> 02:32:02,678
SAM: I am so hard right now. I mean, Scanlan.

2630
02:32:02,678 --> 02:32:07,362
ASHLEY: Which basically infuses a 60 foot radius
with holy power, and any creatures or anything

2631
02:32:07,362 --> 02:32:09,629
can't harm anything inside the radius.

2632
02:32:09,629 --> 02:32:16,839
MATT: All righty. It takes-- look at the casting
time on the spell.

2633
02:32:16,839 --> 02:32:18,422
LAURA: Oh no.

2634
02:32:18,422 --> 02:32:20,786
ASHLEY: God. Dang it.

2635
02:32:20,786 --> 02:32:22,718
(laughter)

2636
02:32:22,718 --> 02:32:23,644
TRAVIS: 24 hours.

2637
02:32:23,644 --> 02:32:25,389
ASHLEY: Scratch that! Okay, so here's what we're
going to do.

2638
02:32:25,389 --> 02:32:26,384
MARISHA: 24 hours?

2639
02:32:26,384 --> 02:32:31,224
MATT: 24 hours. Hallow works, you take 24 hours
and that land, where you do that, is like that

2640
02:32:31,224 --> 02:32:32,843
until someone dispels it.

2641
02:32:32,843 --> 02:32:34,020
LAURA: Oh wow.

2642
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:35,517
ASHLEY: Should have done it when we first got on
the ship.

2643
02:32:35,517 --> 02:32:37,399
TRAVIS: It's like with Hermione and her protection
spell.

2644
02:32:37,399 --> 02:32:40,385
ASHLEY: Okay. That's good to know. Would have been
cool.

2645
02:32:40,385 --> 02:32:42,504
MATT: Instead?

2646
02:32:42,504 --> 02:32:50,989
ASHLEY: Instead, I'm going to Guiding Bolt this
guy right here.

2647
02:32:50,989 --> 02:32:52,630
MATT: This guy here?

2648
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:55,459
ASHLEY: No wait. The flying guy right here.

2649
02:32:55,459 --> 02:32:56,743
MATT: Oh, that one?

2650
02:32:56,743 --> 02:32:57,585
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2651
02:32:57,585 --> 02:33:02,826
MATT: Okay. You currently can't see him,
unfortunately. That is down below the ship because

2652
02:33:02,826 --> 02:33:06,349
it swooped down to pick up the guy who had fallen,
so he is currently out of your view.

2653
02:33:06,349 --> 02:33:08,006
LAURA: (whispers) Guiding Bolt the griffon.

2654
02:33:08,006 --> 02:33:11,549
ASHLEY: Cool. I'll Guiding Bolt-- I can't do that
griffon up there, can I?

2655
02:33:11,549 --> 02:33:15,496
MATT: What's the range on Guiding Bolt? Might be
able to.

2656
02:33:15,496 --> 02:33:16,671
ASHLEY: 120 feet.

2657
02:33:16,671 --> 02:33:17,819
MATT: Yeah, you can get him from there.

2658
02:33:17,819 --> 02:33:18,848
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay. I'll do that.

2659
02:33:18,848 --> 02:33:29,288
MATT: All right. Make your ranged spell attack.
Roll a d20, add that bonus.

2660
02:33:29,355 --> 02:33:32,672
ASHLEY: Oh, man, that's a one.

2661
02:33:32,728 --> 02:33:37,230
MATT: So in your confusion, you reach back to
shoot the wyvern that's on the other side of the

2662
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:41,828
ship. It's not there, and so while the spell is
releasing itself, you're like, "Crap! That one!"

2663
02:33:41,828 --> 02:33:46,566
And by the time you turn around to redirect the
divine energy blast, it arcs off

2664
02:33:46,566 --> 02:33:48,582
in a random direction.

2665
02:33:48,582 --> 02:33:50,717
ASHLEY: What a fail of a motherfucking turn.

2666
02:33:50,717 --> 02:33:52,525
(laughter)

2667
02:33:52,525 --> 02:33:54,986
MATT: You still have a bonus action.

2668
02:33:54,986 --> 02:33:58,390
ASHLEY: Can I still move, if I use my Sprinter's
Boots?

2669
02:33:58,390 --> 02:34:00,115
MATT: Yeah, you can still move. You haven't moved
yet.

2670
02:34:00,115 --> 02:34:02,652
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Sprinter's Boots over
to Vex.

2671
02:34:02,652 --> 02:34:04,176
LAURA: That's me!

2672
02:34:04,176 --> 02:34:06,534
LIAM: Sprinter's Boots. Sprinter's Boots!

2673
02:34:06,534 --> 02:34:08,134
MATT: With Sprinter's Boots, you can get there.

2674
02:34:08,134 --> 02:34:14,311
ASHLEY: And I'm going to give her a Superior
Healing Potion.

2675
02:34:14,311 --> 02:34:17,169
MATT: Okay. You haven't used it yet, but you have
one.

2676
02:34:17,169 --> 02:34:18,187
LAURA: Okay.

2677
02:34:18,187 --> 02:34:19,456
ASHLEY: Oh, I can't give it to her.

2678
02:34:19,456 --> 02:34:22,079
MATT: She has it. You handed it to her, but she
hasn't--

2679
02:34:22,079 --> 02:34:23,437
ASHLEY: Here's a Superior Healing Potion!

2680
02:34:23,437 --> 02:34:25,066
LAURA: I didn't have one! Thanks, Pike!

2681
02:34:25,066 --> 02:34:26,226
ASHLEY: A potion turn.

2682
02:34:26,226 --> 02:34:28,214
LAURA: I can't wait.

2683
02:34:28,214 --> 02:34:30,490
I'll wait and do it.

2684
02:34:30,556 --> 02:34:31,914
MATT: All right. Top of the round.

2685
02:34:31,914 --> 02:34:33,287
ASHLEY: Wait, so she has to use that on her turn,
then?

2686
02:34:33,287 --> 02:34:34,129
MATT: Yeah.

2687
02:34:34,129 --> 02:34:35,370
LAURA: That's okay. That's okay!

2688
02:34:35,370 --> 02:34:38,243
ASHLEY: All right. Let's just go past this really
fast.

2689
02:34:38,243 --> 02:34:39,817
(laughter)

2690
02:34:39,817 --> 02:34:40,926
MATT: Oh, Pike.

2691
02:34:40,926 --> 02:34:41,679
ASHLEY: Let's move on.

2692
02:34:41,679 --> 02:34:43,005
MATT: That's okay. Vex, you're up.

2693
02:34:43,005 --> 02:34:50,316
LAURA: Okay! You know what I'm going to do? I'm
going to use a Superior Healing Potion, which is

2694
02:34:50,316 --> 02:34:52,871
how many-- what do I roll for that?

2695
02:34:52,871 --> 02:34:58,871
MATT: Superior Healing Potion? That is-- wow, 8d4
plus eight.

2696
02:34:58,871 --> 02:34:59,918
LAURA: Whoa.

2697
02:34:59,918 --> 02:35:06,388
MATT: Yeah, it's a big old heal. She's drinking a
potion that Pike just gave her.

2698
02:35:06,388 --> 02:35:07,938
SAM: Were you hurt?

2699
02:35:07,938 --> 02:35:09,831
LAURA: Uh-huh, actually very severely.

2700
02:35:09,831 --> 02:35:11,067
ASHLEY: I just healed her.

2701
02:35:11,067 --> 02:35:12,654
SAM: Thanks, Pike.

2702
02:35:12,654 --> 02:35:18,392
LAURA: I'm going to add those up in just a second.
That's a lot of adding.

2703
02:35:18,462 --> 02:35:20,184
MATT: (laughs) Oh, d4.

2704
02:35:20,184 --> 02:35:27,233
LAURA: Okay, but first I'm going to-- he's on the
ground, so if I step away from him he doesn't get a--

2705
02:35:27,233 --> 02:35:28,777
MATT: Correct, he is not threatening.

2706
02:35:28,777 --> 02:35:31,262
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to move away from that
guy.

2707
02:35:31,262 --> 02:35:32,372
MATT: All right.

2708
02:35:32,372 --> 02:35:33,822
LAURA: I'm going to--

2709
02:35:33,822 --> 02:35:34,806
MATT: How far?

2710
02:35:34,806 --> 02:35:41,328
LAURA: Actually, I'm not going to move-- I'm going
to move against the railing around Grog.

2711
02:35:41,328 --> 02:35:42,594
Can I do that?

2712
02:35:42,594 --> 02:35:43,583
MATT: Yeah, you can move around.

2713
02:35:43,583 --> 02:35:49,445
LAURA: Yeah, and I'm going to stand next to Grog
and hope he overshadows me. And I'm going to

2714
02:35:49,445 --> 02:35:53,501
Lightning Arrow the griffon.

2715
02:35:53,501 --> 02:35:57,214
MATT: All righty. Go ahead and roll for attack on
that.

2716
02:35:57,214 --> 02:36:01,792
LAURA: Why do I feel like a griffon will be immune
to lightning attack?

2717
02:36:01,792 --> 02:36:03,486
ORION: No, it's birds.

2718
02:36:03,486 --> 02:36:04,797
LAURA: They're fine, right?

2719
02:36:04,797 --> 02:36:05,824
SAM: Of course.

2720
02:36:05,824 --> 02:36:06,918
ORION: Birds hate lightning.

2721
02:36:06,918 --> 02:36:09,797
SAM: The griffon is grappled, too. Well, not
grappled.

2722
02:36:09,797 --> 02:36:11,407
MARISHA: (laughs) Birds hate lightning.

2723
02:36:11,407 --> 02:36:13,453
LAURA: That is 4d8. Oh, I have to roll to see if I
hit.

2724
02:36:13,453 --> 02:36:14,622
MATT: Roll for the attack, yeah.

2725
02:36:14,622 --> 02:36:17,730
LAURA: Okay, which one looks like a Lightning
Arrow? This, the amethyst, looks like

2726
02:36:17,730 --> 02:36:18,680
a lightning one.

2727
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:19,879
MATT: There you go.

2728
02:36:19,879 --> 02:36:23,489
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's 25?

2729
02:36:23,489 --> 02:36:25,009
MATT: 25, yeah.

2730
02:36:25,009 --> 02:36:37,068
LAURA: Okay, so now it's 4d8. 15.

2731
02:36:37,068 --> 02:36:42,844
MATT: 15 points of damage to it? All right. So as
you run around Grog, as you rush around his

2732
02:36:42,844 --> 02:36:47,012
shoulder you grab one arrow, pull it back, nock it
in your bow, and underneath his arm as he's

2733
02:36:47,012 --> 02:36:52,045
reaching up with his axe, you release an
arrow. As you release it into the air, it almost

2734
02:36:52,045 --> 02:36:57,538
seems to spark with energy. Halfway to its mark,
all of a sudden the speed it's traveling at

2735
02:36:57,538 --> 02:37:01,238
increases, increases, increases, and you see
energy begin to (crackle) off the front.

2736
02:37:01,238 --> 02:37:05,683
It slams into the side of the griffon with
a blast of energy and electricity surge through

2737
02:37:05,683 --> 02:37:09,383
its body. The griffon loses about ten feet of
height before it catches itself. You can see this

2738
02:37:09,383 --> 02:37:14,175
giant burn mark on the side of its body. It's
having a hard time keeping itself in the air. It's

2739
02:37:14,175 --> 02:37:15,699
looking pretty rough.

2740
02:37:15,699 --> 02:37:23,702
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to have
Trinket charge the elf girl in red.

2741
02:37:23,702 --> 02:37:25,184
MATT: Okay.

2742
02:37:25,184 --> 02:37:28,448
LAURA: Or no, he's going to attack the wyvern
that's on the ground, that makes more sense.

2743
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:29,513
Doesn't it?

2744
02:37:29,513 --> 02:37:31,042
ORION: Shoot his wing off!

2745
02:37:31,042 --> 02:37:34,639
LAURA: And bash him with his new armor, and you
know do stuff.

2746
02:37:34,639 --> 02:37:36,482
(laughter)

2747
02:37:36,482 --> 02:37:41,652
MATT: All right, so as you fire an arrow, Trinket
turns around and comes forward. Go ahead

2748
02:37:41,652 --> 02:37:43,850
and roll an attack for Trinket.

2749
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:46,455
LAURA: Okay. I don't know if I've ever attacked
with Trinket.

2750
02:37:46,455 --> 02:37:47,695
MATT: You have before, it's been a while.

2751
02:37:47,695 --> 02:37:48,958
LAURA: It's been a really long time.

2752
02:37:48,958 --> 02:37:50,617
TALIESIN: Like possibly Pathfinder a while.

2753
02:37:50,617 --> 02:37:51,782
MARISHA: Yeah, it's been a while.

2754
02:37:51,782 --> 02:37:52,913
ORION: Yay, Trinket.

2755
02:37:52,913 --> 02:37:54,106
LAURA: And he rolled a one.

2756
02:37:54,106 --> 02:37:56,608
SAM: With inspiration.

2757
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:59,860
LAURA: With inspiration-- no, it's a one.

2758
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:00,957
MATT: A one is an auto-miss.

2759
02:38:00,957 --> 02:38:02,283
LAURA: It's a frickin' one.

2760
02:38:02,283 --> 02:38:06,801
MATT: So Trinket goes to attack, the wyvern's on
the ground, it's screeching around, moving its

2761
02:38:06,853 --> 02:38:11,342
body, its tail whips out and strikes Trinket in
the side of the armor, almost piercing it with the

2762
02:38:11,342 --> 02:38:14,633
poisonous stinger. Trinket instinctively--

2763
02:38:14,633 --> 02:38:17,008
LAURA: Oh shit, I forgot I was poisoned.

2764
02:38:17,008 --> 02:38:24,021
MATT: Yeah. It's okay. It ricochets off the armor,
but Trinket instinctively recoils from it and

2765
02:38:24,021 --> 02:38:26,733
foregoes the attack to take a defensive stance.

2766
02:38:26,733 --> 02:38:28,178
SAM: We're not doing well.

2767
02:38:28,178 --> 02:38:32,042
LAURA: I forgot I was poisoned! Shit.

2768
02:38:32,042 --> 02:38:34,093
MATT: These weapons set up.

2769
02:38:34,093 --> 02:38:36,658
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to finish the healing potion
just for now.

2770
02:38:36,658 --> 02:38:43,537
MATT: Okay, go for it. This guard pulls back and
aims the ballista up towards the griffon that's in

2771
02:38:43,537 --> 02:38:52,546
the air, releases the bolt that streaks
through the air. The bolt rushes past the griffon,

2772
02:38:52,546 --> 02:38:56,670
unfortunately not finding purchase, the rope
leading off into the distance. As he sees the

2773
02:38:56,670 --> 02:39:02,710
rope, the entire giant bolt misses, curses and
takes a dagger out and cuts the rope and it just

2774
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:06,070
disappears out over the side and he goes, spends
the rest of his turn getting ready to prepare for

2775
02:39:06,124 --> 02:39:12,767
a second shot. This one over here currently has
the ready-to-fire bolt, has no means of doing so,

2776
02:39:12,794 --> 02:39:17,635
instead draws a weapon and begins to rush over to
try and join the fray with the wyvern over here,

2777
02:39:17,687 --> 02:39:22,222
he can't quite get all the way over to fight it.
That ends his turn. Vax, you're up.

2778
02:39:22,222 --> 02:39:23,629
TRAVIS: This guy's still alive in the back,
right?

2779
02:39:23,629 --> 02:39:24,658
MATT: Yeah, you just can't see him.

2780
02:39:24,658 --> 02:39:25,940
TRAVIS: Okay. We can't see him.

2781
02:39:25,940 --> 02:39:31,860
LIAM: I'm going to run up alongside Trinket on the
side and stab the grounded wyvern

2782
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:33,785
two or three times.

2783
02:39:33,785 --> 02:39:36,194
MATT: Okay, you have your boots of haste, so you
can do this, because you have to go up the stairs

2784
02:39:36,194 --> 02:39:41,722
here to get to the next level. Right there. All
right, so now you're up on the--

2785
02:39:41,722 --> 02:39:45,656
LIAM: I'll use keen dagger to start, gets a 23.

2786
02:39:45,656 --> 02:39:47,727
MATT: All right. That hits.

2787
02:39:47,727 --> 02:39:53,576
LIAM: Okay, so that's 11 points of damage plus the
Sneak Attack damage.

2788
02:39:53,628 --> 02:39:55,387
MATT: Oh, this is going to be nasty.

2789
02:39:55,387 --> 02:39:59,034
SAM: Leave some for Grog!

2790
02:39:59,034 --> 02:40:05,526
LIAM: 13 Sneak Attack damage, so that's 11 plus
13, first dagger.

2791
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:07,306
MATT: Nice, 24 damage.

2792
02:40:07,306 --> 02:40:14,002
LIAM: Second dagger gets a 26.

2793
02:40:14,002 --> 02:40:15,189
MATT: Hits.

2794
02:40:15,189 --> 02:40:23,894
LIAM: Hits. That is a ten of damage and the third
dagger gets a 16.

2795
02:40:23,962 --> 02:40:26,740
MATT: 16 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

2796
02:40:26,740 --> 02:40:28,512
LIAM: It does, it does? Very nice.

2797
02:40:28,512 --> 02:40:29,520
MATT: Yeah.

2798
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:30,974
TRAVIS: Come on, Jersey, roll that shit.

2799
02:40:30,974 --> 02:40:31,814
MARISHA: Yeah, Jersey.

2800
02:40:31,814 --> 02:40:37,285
MATT: Technically all these attacks-- the creature
is prone so you have advantage on these attacks

2801
02:40:37,285 --> 02:40:38,571
too, by the way.

2802
02:40:38,571 --> 02:40:41,004
LIAM: Oh, well. Did they all hit?

2803
02:40:41,004 --> 02:40:44,566
MATT: Yes. Go ahead and roll a second one for this
last one just on the off-chance

2804
02:40:44,566 --> 02:40:46,794
it might critical.

2805
02:40:46,794 --> 02:40:48,157
LIAM: It was less.

2806
02:40:48,157 --> 02:40:49,882
MATT: Okay, so then you're fine, all right.

2807
02:40:49,882 --> 02:40:52,211
LIAM: Should I throw two more? Okay, I'm good with
everything else.

2808
02:40:52,211 --> 02:40:55,269
MATT: So damage on the last one?

2809
02:40:55,269 --> 02:40:59,797
LIAM: Oh, it was... eight.

2810
02:40:59,797 --> 02:41:03,038
MATT: Eight, got you. All right, so as you rush
around Trinket, you come up with your daggers,

2811
02:41:03,038 --> 02:41:08,393
stab-stab-stab, you're jamming it in the side and
you can see the dark black dragon blood spilling

2812
02:41:08,447 --> 02:41:11,735
out of each wound as you're piercing it, it's
screeching out and trying to get back to its feet

2813
02:41:11,735 --> 02:41:14,985
in the process, but you just keep finding each
opening and jamming in with your blades.

2814
02:41:14,985 --> 02:41:19,171
LIAM: And as a bonus action I want to take my hand
under Trinket's ears and go,

2815
02:41:19,171 --> 02:41:21,134
wooga-wooga-wooga-wooga.

2816
02:41:21,134 --> 02:41:24,327
MATT: (laughs) Trinket goes (bear noises) and rubs
into them.

2817
02:41:24,327 --> 02:41:26,516
LAURA: Would you mind healing him? He's low on
health.

2818
02:41:26,516 --> 02:41:31,793
LIAM: Such a glass half empty girl.

2819
02:41:31,793 --> 02:41:47,085
MATT: The griffon is going to take its turn. 40.
It's going to swoop down towards Keyleth. It's

2820
02:41:47,109 --> 02:41:48,805
going to attempt to grapple you.

2821
02:41:48,805 --> 02:41:50,903
MARISHA: I go, Hey friend!

2822
02:41:50,903 --> 02:41:54,401
MATT: Go ahead and make either an acrobatics or
athletics check, your choice.

2823
02:41:54,401 --> 02:41:55,506
TRAVIS: Oh no.

2824
02:41:55,506 --> 02:42:10,464
MARISHA: Let's do athletics. Oh. It's okay. 15.

2825
02:42:10,464 --> 02:42:15,948
MATT: 15? The griffon reaches down, (ksh ksh)
grapples into you with each of its talons and

2826
02:42:16,114 --> 02:42:19,869
lifts up, carrying you and it--

2827
02:42:19,869 --> 02:42:22,322
MARISHA: It's okay guys, I'll be fine!

2828
02:42:22,322 --> 02:42:26,073
MATT: -- shoves you off the side. You begin to
plummet off the side of the ship, you see it

2829
02:42:26,073 --> 02:42:28,250
vanish above you.

2830
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:29,577
SAM: She'll be fine, she'll be fine.

2831
02:42:29,577 --> 02:42:31,706
MARISHA: I'll be fine!

2832
02:42:31,706 --> 02:42:34,268
LAURA: Look, Keyleth, it's what you wanted.

2833
02:42:34,268 --> 02:42:36,301
MARISHA: This is fun!

2834
02:42:36,301 --> 02:42:38,297
MATT: Tiberius and Grog.

2835
02:42:38,297 --> 02:42:50,763
ORION: So that thing went to go save his dude. I
turn to him, super annoyed, and I go,

2836
02:42:50,838 --> 02:42:55,344
(speaking Draconian) and I use Telekinesis and I 
rip off his wing.

2837
02:42:55,344 --> 02:42:56,921
MATT: Which guy?

2838
02:42:56,921 --> 02:42:58,055
ORION: The wyvern.

2839
02:42:58,055 --> 02:42:59,199
LIAM: All of them.

2840
02:42:59,199 --> 02:43:00,391
LAURA: You can rip off his whole wing?

2841
02:43:00,391 --> 02:43:03,092
MATT: This one here you can't see, it's like far
below the ship because it dove down to catch its

2842
02:43:03,092 --> 02:43:07,819
guy, it's not currently in visible range. Like,
this is off the board, essentially, it's down

2843
02:43:07,819 --> 02:43:08,678
below there.

2844
02:43:08,678 --> 02:43:09,962
ORION: Oh, crap.

2845
02:43:09,962 --> 02:43:11,309
LAURA: Rip all the griffon's feathers off.

2846
02:43:11,309 --> 02:43:16,452
ORION: I don't do any of that stuff. Just pluck
it. This is annoying you.

2847
02:43:16,452 --> 02:43:20,686
MARISHA: Prepare it for dinner.

2848
02:43:20,686 --> 02:43:25,495
ORION: What's going on? Who's this dude over
here?

2849
02:43:25,495 --> 02:43:31,498
MATT: This is one of the riders that managed to
just barely grapple on and pull itself to the top

2850
02:43:31,498 --> 02:43:32,701
of the ship.

2851
02:43:32,701 --> 02:43:34,182
ORION: And this is the elven--

2852
02:43:34,182 --> 02:43:36,468
MATT: This is the elven one who was on top of the
griffon.

2853
02:43:36,468 --> 02:43:37,367
ORION: Okay.

2854
02:43:37,367 --> 02:43:38,879
MATT: It got dumped off by Scanlan.

2855
02:43:38,879 --> 02:43:52,189
ORION: Oh. Let's see. How many between the two...
how many-- what's the distance between-- what's

2856
02:43:52,189 --> 02:43:53,625
this thing right here?

2857
02:43:53,625 --> 02:43:55,631
MATT: That's one of the ballistas at the front.
It's ready to fire, it just hasn't been fired yet.

2858
02:43:55,631 --> 02:43:57,082
SAM: Lotta questions, lotta questions.

2859
02:43:57,082 --> 02:44:05,502
ORION: Oh. That's fun. Okay. I'm going to use my
movement to get around over here-- because that's

2860
02:44:05,502 --> 02:44:07,220
all 60 feet, right?

2861
02:44:07,220 --> 02:44:08,355
MATT: Yeah.

2862
02:44:08,355 --> 02:44:15,827
ORION: Ah, cool. Well then, I'll use-- screw it,
I'll use Telekinesis to pick up that elf and huck

2863
02:44:15,827 --> 02:44:17,014
it right into the ballista.

2864
02:44:17,014 --> 02:44:23,826
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make your roll, d20 plus
five.

2865
02:44:23,826 --> 02:44:26,290
ORION: Ooh, natural 20.

2866
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:28,608
(cheering)

2867
02:44:28,608 --> 02:44:38,585
MATT: So you take-- the elf is down, pulling two
blades out, is lifted up in the air and flung off to

2868
02:44:38,585 --> 02:44:43,169
the side. The female form slams into the ballista
from behind, setting it off. You see now the bolt

2869
02:44:43,232 --> 02:44:45,494
just arcs off the side of the boat.

2870
02:44:45,494 --> 02:44:47,821
SAM: Nice.

2871
02:44:47,821 --> 02:44:54,724
MATT: The elf, which, it's currently grappled now
and held against the side, takes seven points of

2872
02:44:54,724 --> 02:45:02,353
impact damage from the full slamming attack. All
right. The ballista was aimed this way.

2873
02:45:02,353 --> 02:45:06,008
MARISHA: Oh, were you trying to skewer him?

2874
02:45:06,008 --> 02:45:07,188
ORION: Yeah.

2875
02:45:07,188 --> 02:45:08,444
MARISHA AND LAURA: Oh.

2876
02:45:08,444 --> 02:45:14,003
ORION: I still do that. I lift him up and do that
instead.

2877
02:45:14,003 --> 02:45:15,471
MATT: Ballista's already fired, though.

2878
02:45:15,471 --> 02:45:16,839
TRAVIS: It's gone.

2879
02:45:16,839 --> 02:45:18,106
LAURA: Yeah, it's gone.

2880
02:45:18,106 --> 02:45:20,084
MATT: I mean, you slam him into it and fire it
off.

2881
02:45:20,159 --> 02:45:23,356
LAURA: That's okay, you still flung him real
hard.

2882
02:45:23,356 --> 02:45:24,833
ORION: Cool, that's my turn.

2883
02:45:24,833 --> 02:45:26,567
MATT: Sorry.

2884
02:45:26,567 --> 02:45:28,225
ORION: It's fine.

2885
02:45:28,225 --> 02:45:30,362
MARISHA: You and Ashley.

2886
02:45:30,362 --> 02:45:31,877
ASHLEY: We had a week off.

2887
02:45:31,877 --> 02:45:34,319
MATT: Yeah, you're getting into the swing of
things.

2888
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:35,529
ASHLEY: Getting our wiggles out.

2889
02:45:35,529 --> 02:45:37,084
MATT: Grog, you're up.

2890
02:45:37,084 --> 02:45:45,053
TRAVIS: Seeing the wyvern at my feet, I feel that
familiar tremble in my loins and I take my hand

2891
02:45:45,053 --> 02:45:47,556
out of the chain and I go into a frenzied rage.

2892
02:45:47,556 --> 02:45:48,827
ORION: Yay, rage!

2893
02:45:48,827 --> 02:45:52,984
TRAVIS: And I would like to butcher the
ever-living fuck out of that mini-dragon.

2894
02:45:52,984 --> 02:45:55,931
MATT: All right, make an attack. It's starting to
get to its feet now.

2895
02:45:55,931 --> 02:46:02,322
TRAVIS: Oh, hold on, kitty. 15 plus eight is--

2896
02:46:02,322 --> 02:46:05,419
MATT: You still have advantage on it, by the way,
remember, because it's still technically prone.

2897
02:46:05,494 --> 02:46:06,803
TRAVIS: Oh. 23.

2898
02:46:06,803 --> 02:46:08,023
MATT: Hits.

2899
02:46:08,023 --> 02:46:09,621
TRAVIS: 23 again.

2900
02:46:09,621 --> 02:46:10,312
MATT: Roll.

2901
02:46:10,312 --> 02:46:12,226
LAURA: No, you already did it.

2902
02:46:12,226 --> 02:46:13,418
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2903
02:46:13,418 --> 02:46:15,049
MATT: So hit, critical, and...

2904
02:46:15,049 --> 02:46:16,679
TRAVIS: The third one.

2905
02:46:16,679 --> 02:46:17,711
LAURA: What?

2906
02:46:17,711 --> 02:46:19,259
MARISHA: That makes up for so much shit.

2907
02:46:19,259 --> 02:46:20,838
ASHLEY: Kill him, kill him!

2908
02:46:20,838 --> 02:46:21,883
TRAVIS: 18.

2909
02:46:21,883 --> 02:46:22,613
MATT: Hits.

2910
02:46:22,613 --> 02:46:23,611
TRAVIS: Nice, all three.

2911
02:46:23,611 --> 02:46:25,245
MATT: Hit, critical, hit. So for the first hit?

2912
02:46:25,245 --> 02:46:29,715
TRAVIS: Eight.

2913
02:46:29,715 --> 02:46:32,084
MATT: Eight damage?

2914
02:46:32,084 --> 02:46:32,938
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2915
02:46:32,938 --> 02:46:34,027
MATT: Even with the bonus?

2916
02:46:34,027 --> 02:46:35,147
TRAVIS: Yeah, I rolled a one.

2917
02:46:35,147 --> 02:46:37,089
MATT: A one, okay, so eight. Now your critical.

2918
02:46:37,089 --> 02:46:38,939
TRAVIS: Critical, so is that two of these? 2d12?

2919
02:46:38,939 --> 02:46:41,157
MATT: Just roll it once and double the number.

2920
02:46:41,157 --> 02:46:44,958
TRAVIS: Oh, awesome, 19.

2921
02:46:44,958 --> 02:46:48,713
MATT: Add that plus at the end, so whatever you
rolled--

2922
02:46:48,713 --> 02:46:49,738
TRAVIS: 19.

2923
02:46:49,738 --> 02:46:51,025
MATT: You rolled a 19?

2924
02:46:51,025 --> 02:46:52,117
TRAVIS: I rolled a 12 plus--

2925
02:46:52,117 --> 02:46:54,052
MATT: So 12, that's 24 plus seven.

2926
02:46:54,052 --> 02:46:54,919
TRAVIS: Oh, gotcha.

2927
02:46:54,919 --> 02:46:55,915
MATT: So 31.

2928
02:46:55,915 --> 02:46:56,707
TRAVIS: 31.

2929
02:46:56,707 --> 02:46:57,972
MATT: All righty.

2930
02:46:57,972 --> 02:47:02,877
TRAVIS: And the last one. 16.

2931
02:47:02,877 --> 02:47:10,025
MATT: Nice! So you just smack, smack, smack the
giant axe, as with each arc backward you can see

2932
02:47:10,104 --> 02:47:14,813
the blood spray just through the air, it's
spattering part of the ship. It's screeching in

2933
02:47:14,813 --> 02:47:21,545
pain, trying to reach around it for some sort of
purchase. You leave gaping wounds in its side. It

2934
02:47:21,545 --> 02:47:24,425
still seems to be ready to go.

2935
02:47:24,425 --> 02:47:27,344
LAURA: These things are hard.

2936
02:47:27,344 --> 02:47:29,805
MATT: Pretty tough. Pretty tough, these wyverns.

2937
02:47:29,805 --> 02:47:32,024
SAM: Did you take the wyvern or the rider?

2938
02:47:32,024 --> 02:47:33,441
TRAVIS: Wyvern.

2939
02:47:33,441 --> 02:47:34,957
MATT: So Grog, you stay where you are?

2940
02:47:34,957 --> 02:47:37,336
TRAVIS: Yes.

2941
02:47:37,336 --> 02:47:41,668
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, you
are currently falling.

2942
02:47:41,668 --> 02:47:51,428
MARISHA: Before I turn into anything, I take in
the scenery, and I'm like, "This is peaceful."

2943
02:47:51,428 --> 02:47:54,779
MATT: Very serene.

2944
02:47:54,779 --> 02:47:59,288
MARISHA: Nice. And then I turn into an air
elemental (whoosh).

2945
02:47:59,288 --> 02:48:01,804
SAM: Is that a thing?

2946
02:48:01,804 --> 02:48:02,624
MARISHA: Yes.

2947
02:48:02,624 --> 02:48:03,764
TRAVIS: Not a shark?

2948
02:48:03,764 --> 02:48:05,204
MARISHA: Not a shark, I know.

2949
02:48:05,204 --> 02:48:06,526
LAURA: That could be cool too.

2950
02:48:06,526 --> 02:48:07,524
MARISHA: That would be funny.

2951
02:48:07,524 --> 02:48:08,985
TALIESIN: Turn into a flying shark.

2952
02:48:08,985 --> 02:48:10,322
MARISHA: And I'm like, Oops.

2953
02:48:10,322 --> 02:48:11,741
SAM: My head is like a shark's fin.

2954
02:48:11,741 --> 02:48:12,993
TRAVIS: For when this goes in the water.

2955
02:48:12,993 --> 02:48:14,247
TALIESIN: Intelligent flying shark.

2956
02:48:14,247 --> 02:48:19,225
MATT: In my disappointing haste, I forgot to bring
your elemental figures and I apologize.

2957
02:48:19,298 --> 02:48:21,015
MARISHA: It's okay, I'm air. So I'm there.

2958
02:48:21,015 --> 02:48:24,709
MATT: We'll use this, we'll put this around you.
So this is you as an air elemental right there. So

2959
02:48:24,709 --> 02:48:26,294
pretty. You're air.

2960
02:48:26,294 --> 02:48:27,507
LAURA: Around you.

2961
02:48:27,507 --> 02:48:32,544
MATT: Sorry, guys, usually better about that.
Today's been crazy. So you--

2962
02:48:32,544 --> 02:48:34,053
MARISHA: I turn into 'poof.'

2963
02:48:34,053 --> 02:48:38,916
MATT: Now in your natural element, there is no
fall, you stop yourself immediately. You're no

2964
02:48:38,916 --> 02:48:41,554
more than maybe 20 feet below the bow of the
ship.

2965
02:48:41,621 --> 02:48:44,262
MARISHA: Okay, cool. I'm only 20 feet? Awesome.

2966
02:48:44,262 --> 02:48:45,835
MATT: What's your flying speed? As an earth
elemental?

2967
02:48:45,835 --> 02:48:49,040
MARISHA: It's 60. It's the same, like all of them
if you're moving through air and such,

2968
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:50,002
I'm pretty sure.

2969
02:48:50,002 --> 02:48:52,537
MATT: Your own terrain, 60? Yeah. So you can get
up onto the bow and still have 40 feet to go.

2970
02:48:52,537 --> 02:48:57,312
MARISHA: Okay, so. Who's the nearest bad guy?

2971
02:48:57,312 --> 02:48:59,207
MATT: The griffon that just threw you off.

2972
02:48:59,207 --> 02:49:03,760
MARISHA: Is that a bad guy next to him? Or is that
a guard?

2973
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:06,336
MATT: That's a bad guy right there. That's a
guard, that's what was riding--

2974
02:49:06,336 --> 02:49:08,754
MARISHA: My air elemental's a big space, right?

2975
02:49:08,754 --> 02:49:09,800
MATT: Yes, a large.

2976
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:20,455
MARISHA: Okay. So here's what I do. I go up and
I'm like (whoosh) this big dark scary cloud, and

2977
02:49:20,455 --> 02:49:25,340
then I go up and I'm going to do Whirlwind and I
go full tornado.

2978
02:49:25,516 --> 02:49:26,543
MATT: Okay.

2979
02:49:26,543 --> 02:49:28,001
MARISHA: Full twister.

2980
02:49:28,001 --> 02:49:32,896
MATT: This form-- you guys have never seen this
before. All of a sudden, this giant angry cluster

2981
02:49:32,896 --> 02:49:39,009
of elemental energy, this wind, begins to (wind
sounds) like angry eyes almost, based on the

2982
02:49:39,009 --> 02:49:45,645
energy source within, begin swirling in this giant
cyclone. Localized. Both the griffon being pulled

2983
02:49:45,645 --> 02:49:49,208
into it as well as the other creature on the side.
The effects of that?

2984
02:49:49,208 --> 02:49:53,815
MARISHA: They have to make a DC 13 strength saving
throw.

2985
02:49:53,815 --> 02:50:02,888
MATT: All right. The griffon does succeed. This
wyvern-rider does not.

2986
02:50:02,888 --> 02:50:11,940
MARISHA: Awesome. On a failure a target takes 3d8
plus two bludgeoning damage.

2987
02:50:11,999 --> 02:50:13,441
MATT: Nice.

2988
02:50:13,441 --> 02:50:26,558
MARISHA: So I'll do that real quick. That's okay,
so two, one, roll this one. Five. Ten damage.

2989
02:50:26,558 --> 02:50:28,127
MATT: All righty.

2990
02:50:28,127 --> 02:50:33,195
MARISHA: And he's flung 20 feet in a random
direction and knocked prone.

2991
02:50:33,195 --> 02:50:35,598
MATT: All right. A random direction.

2992
02:50:35,598 --> 02:50:38,453
MARISHA: Hopefully it's randomly off the side of
the ship.

2993
02:50:38,453 --> 02:50:47,434
MATT: Random direction. We'll say it's wherever
the four is there. Four. Falls off and actually

2994
02:50:47,434 --> 02:50:49,444
slams into the top of this--

2995
02:50:49,444 --> 02:50:50,487
MARISHA: Wing?

2996
02:50:50,487 --> 02:50:56,022
MATT: -- this wing. It begins to slide off and is
going to attempt to catch itself on the edge of

2997
02:50:56,094 --> 02:50:57,067
the wing.

2998
02:50:57,067 --> 02:50:57,868
TRAVIS: Fail! Fail!

2999
02:50:57,868 --> 02:50:58,741
MARISHA: Fail, fail!

3000
02:50:58,741 --> 02:50:59,594
MATT: Fails.

3001
02:50:59,594 --> 02:51:00,985
(shouting)

3002
02:51:00,985 --> 02:51:03,062
TALIESIN: Save every one of us.

3003
02:51:03,062 --> 02:51:15,632
MATT: Is flung off the side and falls out of view.
Damn, all right. You still have about 40 feet, or

3004
02:51:15,708 --> 02:51:18,451
30 feet of movement at this point.

3005
02:51:18,451 --> 02:51:26,321
MARISHA: Oh wait, and if the target hits like a
wall he takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every ten

3006
02:51:26,321 --> 02:51:27,943
feet he was thrown.

3007
02:51:27,943 --> 02:51:30,475
TALIESIN: I think he's going to hit a lot of
bludgeoning damage when he hits the ocean.

3008
02:51:30,475 --> 02:51:45,464
MARISHA: If the saving throw's successful, the
target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't

3009
02:51:45,464 --> 02:51:47,072
flung or thrown--

3010
02:51:47,072 --> 02:51:48,698
MATT: All right, so five damage?

3011
02:51:48,698 --> 02:51:50,305
MARISHA: Yeah, he still takes five damage.

3012
02:51:50,305 --> 02:51:54,209
MATT: Okay. From the buffeting of the wind,
griffon manages to keep itself in place. All

3013
02:51:54,209 --> 02:51:55,411
right. That end your turn?

3014
02:51:55,411 --> 02:51:56,392
MARISHA: That ends my turn.

3015
02:51:56,392 --> 02:51:59,552
MATT: All right. Now it's the wyvern and the
wyvern-riders' turn. This wyvern gets up to its

3016
02:51:59,552 --> 02:52:07,385
feet again, no longer prone. It's going to, after
being stabbed repeatedly and axed repeatedly, it's

3017
02:52:07,385 --> 02:52:20,726
going to angrily strike out... It's going to go
ahead and make a bite attack and a stinger attack.

3018
02:52:20,726 --> 02:52:26,552
Bite attack's going to be at you, Grog, stinger
attack's going to be at Vax, since he's right

3019
02:52:26,552 --> 02:52:29,939
behind him. Bite attack against you, Grog, is
going to be a 22 to hit.

3020
02:52:29,939 --> 02:52:31,219
TRAVIS: That hits.

3021
02:52:31,219 --> 02:52:33,142
MATT: All right. You go ahead and take--

3022
02:52:33,142 --> 02:52:35,330
TRAVIS: Would that be bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing, by any chance?

3023
02:52:35,330 --> 02:52:36,582
MATT: That would be piercing.

3024
02:52:36,582 --> 02:52:37,797
TRAVIS: I half on that.

3025
02:52:37,797 --> 02:52:41,866
MATT: Yes you do. So you would take 14 points of
damage. You take seven instead.

3026
02:52:41,866 --> 02:52:43,349
TRAVIS: Okay, all right.

3027
02:52:43,349 --> 02:52:49,033
MATT: Because you have too many hit points and
don't like damage. Against-- that's a natural 20.

3028
02:52:49,033 --> 02:52:50,339
SAM: Natural 20.

3029
02:52:50,339 --> 02:52:51,867
MATT: Natural 20 on you, Vax.

3030
02:52:51,867 --> 02:52:55,117
LAURA: Oh no! Twinsie!

3031
02:52:55,296 --> 02:52:58,749
MATT: So I'm going to assume that hits. (laughs)
So Vax, you take--

3032
02:52:58,749 --> 02:53:02,529
LIAM: He's at disadvantage because I'm on Skype?

3033
02:53:02,529 --> 02:53:04,976
(laughter)

3034
02:53:04,976 --> 02:53:06,454
ASHLEY: And wasn't he prone?

3035
02:53:06,454 --> 02:53:07,448
TRAVIS: No, he's up.

3036
02:53:07,448 --> 02:53:08,718
LAURA: He's up now, yeah.

3037
02:53:08,718 --> 02:53:16,285
MATT: All right. So that is, you take 25 points of
piercing damage from the stinger.

3038
02:53:16,285 --> 02:53:17,904
LIAM: Wait, what did he roll?

3039
02:53:17,904 --> 02:53:19,438
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3040
02:53:19,438 --> 02:53:20,966
MATT: He rolled a natural 20.

3041
02:53:20,966 --> 02:53:22,270
LIAM: A natural 20? Then he hits.

3042
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:33,399
MATT: Yeah. So you take 25 points of piercing
damage, 25 points of piercing damage, and I need

3043
02:53:33,399 --> 02:53:36,193
you to make a constitution saving throw.

3044
02:53:36,193 --> 02:53:37,223
LIAM: All right.

3045
02:53:37,223 --> 02:53:38,501
LAURA: Roll well.

3046
02:53:38,501 --> 02:53:39,393
ASHLEY: Come on.

3047
02:53:39,393 --> 02:53:44,436
LIAM: I'm doing it. I'm in New Jersey and I'm
rolling for constitution. That's a five.

3048
02:53:44,436 --> 02:53:46,163
MARISHA: To be fair, you're in Jersey, so.

3049
02:53:46,163 --> 02:53:48,229
SAM: It's the birthplace of the Constitution.

3050
02:53:48,229 --> 02:53:50,154
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's accurate.

3051
02:53:50,154 --> 02:53:52,403
SAM: No, I think it's Philadelphia, it's
Philadelphia.

3052
02:53:52,403 --> 02:53:58,106
MATT: All right. So you take 29 points of poison
damage as the stinger shoots out from the wyvern,

3053
02:53:58,106 --> 02:54:04,540
pierces you in the abdomen, already stabbing
through your guts, and you can feel it destroying

3054
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:09,387
a lot of your internal organs, and then all of a
sudden there's a pulse of burning, fiery pain as

3055
02:54:09,387 --> 02:54:15,239
the poison just disperses into your system as it
pulls out of your torso. That's rough.

3056
02:54:15,239 --> 02:54:17,069
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not doing too well.

3057
02:54:17,069 --> 02:54:18,843
ASHLEY: Where are you at?

3058
02:54:18,843 --> 02:54:21,782
LIAM: Well, I'm doing really bad, let's just say
that.

3059
02:54:21,782 --> 02:54:24,492
MATT: That's that wyvern. The other wyvern is
still plummeting as a bunny.

3060
02:54:24,492 --> 02:54:26,335
LAURA: He hasn't hit the water yet?

3061
02:54:26,335 --> 02:54:27,772
MATT: No, you guys are a ways up.

3062
02:54:27,772 --> 02:54:28,698
LAURA: Whoa.

3063
02:54:28,698 --> 02:54:30,558
MATT: This wyvern swings up now with its rider.

3064
02:54:30,558 --> 02:54:33,188
LIAM: I don't feel so good.

3065
02:54:33,188 --> 02:54:35,275
LAURA: Take a healing potion!

3066
02:54:35,275 --> 02:54:40,277
MATT: Does a fly-by here with its movement. Its
rider, who's currently clutching a spear-type

3067
02:54:40,277 --> 02:54:50,574
object, flings it down at the blue crystal. As it
slams into the crystal, there's a spark of energy

3068
02:54:50,574 --> 02:54:57,209
and the blue crystal seems to wink out of magical
energy, its coloration growing dark. The entire

3069
02:54:57,209 --> 02:55:03,968
ship begins to list to one side.
Everyone shifts 15 feet this way.

3070
02:55:03,968 --> 02:55:05,686
SAM: Oh my god.

3071
02:55:05,686 --> 02:55:09,787
LAURA: Wait, which way? Oh, we all shift, so okay,
we're already against the railing.

3072
02:55:09,894 --> 02:55:13,450
MATT: Yeah, on the stairway. Tiberius, I'm going
to go ahead and have you roll an acrobatics check

3073
02:55:13,628 --> 02:55:15,899
to try and catch yourself, because you're on the
stairs when you get knocked off.

3074
02:55:15,899 --> 02:55:16,908
ORION: Nope.

3075
02:55:16,908 --> 02:55:19,078
MATT: So you fall prone, 15 feet there, on the
ground.

3076
02:55:19,078 --> 02:55:23,542
LAURA: Oh no. Can we all Star Trek it?

3077
02:55:23,542 --> 02:55:26,321
MATT: This guy's going to try to catch himself
here.

3078
02:55:26,321 --> 02:55:28,094
ALL: Whoa!

3079
02:55:28,094 --> 02:55:34,118
MATT: Catches himself. This elf here goes to
there. This guy moves 15 feet to there. Keyleth

3080
02:55:34,118 --> 02:55:35,954
isn't touched.

3081
02:55:35,954 --> 02:55:40,274
TALIESIN: You've got to grip the table for that.

3082
02:55:40,274 --> 02:55:41,983
LAURA: Oh yeah, you've got to grip.

3083
02:55:41,983 --> 02:55:45,249
MATT: Wyvern slides and catches itself off the
edge. Pushed there. Pushed to the stairs.

3084
02:55:45,249 --> 02:55:48,326
MARISHA: Is that wyvern flying?

3085
02:55:48,326 --> 02:55:56,439
MATT: I need Grog and Vex to each make... Make a
dexterity check to try and catch yourself on the

3086
02:55:56,439 --> 02:55:58,132
edge of the boat.

3087
02:55:58,132 --> 02:56:00,398
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. Come on, you guys.

3088
02:56:00,398 --> 02:56:01,860
TRAVIS: 21.

3089
02:56:01,860 --> 02:56:04,821
SAM: Vex, I've inspired you.

3090
02:56:04,821 --> 02:56:06,606
LAURA: That's true, but I don't need it.

3091
02:56:06,606 --> 02:56:13,667
LIAM: Do not kill my sister while I'm away.

3092
02:56:13,667 --> 02:56:15,658
LAURA: That's a 29 for me.

3093
02:56:15,658 --> 02:56:19,942
MATT: Both of you guys manage-- you're flung to
the side, hit the railing, your bodies tumble over

3094
02:56:20,017 --> 02:56:24,183
the side, and both Grog and Vex catch the railing
and are now dangling on the side of the ship as

3095
02:56:24,183 --> 02:56:27,492
it's listing to the side. You both look over at
each other with a (sigh of relief).

3096
02:56:27,492 --> 02:56:29,455
TRAVIS: Hi.

3097
02:56:29,455 --> 02:56:30,731
LAURA: Hey.

3098
02:56:30,731 --> 02:56:32,812
TRAVIS: Crazy shit, huh?

3099
02:56:32,812 --> 02:56:41,713
MATT: So that's his action. As the continuation of
its movement, the wyvern comes down towards the

3100
02:56:41,891 --> 02:56:47,511
now caught off his-- knocked away from the reins
of the ship, is going to attempt

3101
02:56:47,511 --> 02:56:50,133
to grapple the captain.

3102
02:56:50,133 --> 02:56:51,223
SAM: Not Damon!

3103
02:56:51,223 --> 02:56:52,887
LAURA: No, not Damon!

3104
02:56:52,887 --> 02:56:55,725
SAM: Oh no, not handsome Damon. Oh, no.

3105
02:56:55,725 --> 02:56:56,953
MATT: Fails his roll.

3106
02:56:56,953 --> 02:56:57,983
LAURA: Damon, no!

3107
02:56:57,983 --> 02:56:59,122
MATT: Is now grappled by the wyvern.

3108
02:56:59,122 --> 02:57:00,715
MARISHA: Son of a fuck, we can't lose our
captain.

3109
02:57:00,715 --> 02:57:04,243
ASHLEY: I can captain the ship if I need to.

3110
02:57:04,243 --> 02:57:06,600
MATT: Reaches the edge of the ship, it doesn't
have enough movement to get him all the way off,

3111
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:09,659
but is in the process of dragging him off. You can
see the captain is now reaching up, trying to

3112
02:57:09,722 --> 02:57:12,190
fight his way off the wyvern who's dragging him
off the edge of the ship, but that's as far as it

3113
02:57:12,190 --> 02:57:15,567
can go with the rest of its movement, since it had
to move up and over the edge of the ship. That's

3114
02:57:15,567 --> 02:57:16,817
the end of its turn.

3115
02:57:16,817 --> 02:57:17,996
MARISHA: Damn it.

3116
02:57:17,996 --> 02:57:22,046
MATT: I'm going to put it at about there.

3117
02:57:22,046 --> 02:57:26,425
LAURA: Oh no. Everything's falling.

3118
02:57:26,425 --> 02:57:35,892
MATT: It happens. Dedicated little miniatures. All
right. That brings us to... That's all their

3119
02:57:35,892 --> 02:57:42,271
turns. Percy, you're up. The ship now (sliding
sound), this weird object now is just like

3120
02:57:42,271 --> 02:57:44,605
sparking energy at the edge of the blue crystal.

3121
02:57:44,605 --> 02:57:51,440
TALIESIN: I'm going to just hold on to Bad News as
I'm flicking around, I'm going to pull out my

3122
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:56,251
Pepperbox, I'm going to take a wing shot at that
bastard right there.

3123
02:57:56,251 --> 02:57:57,423
MATT: Right there? Okay.

3124
02:57:57,423 --> 02:57:59,868
LIAM: Do it, Percy, do it.

3125
02:57:59,868 --> 02:58:03,529
TALIESIN: (laughs) 29.

3126
02:58:03,529 --> 02:58:05,692
MATT: 29 definitively hits.

3127
02:58:05,692 --> 02:58:10,513
TALIESIN: That definitively hits. So let's figure
out what we're going to do to this person.

3128
02:58:10,513 --> 02:58:14,480
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on. We got a flat tire.

3129
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:20,811
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage plus a 14
constitution saving roll--

3130
02:58:20,811 --> 02:58:24,179
MATT: Which with a five it does not make.

3131
02:58:24,179 --> 02:58:25,922
TALIESIN: So it drops 20 feet.

3132
02:58:25,922 --> 02:58:31,479
MATT: It drops 20 feet, slams into the deck. It
isn't knocked prone, but the captain is slammed

3133
02:58:31,479 --> 02:58:35,549
into the ground as well and is not currently being
held over the edge of the ship. It still has him

3134
02:58:35,549 --> 02:58:41,532
in its clutches, but he's not being dangled over
the edge.

3135
02:58:41,532 --> 02:58:44,468
TALIESIN: He still has him in his claws, though.

3136
02:58:44,468 --> 02:58:45,346
MATT: Yeah.

3137
02:58:45,346 --> 02:58:46,885
TALIESIN: All right, I'll take another shot at
him.

3138
02:58:46,885 --> 02:58:47,722
MATT: All right.

3139
02:58:47,722 --> 02:58:51,571
TALIESIN: I'm going to make this a fire shot. And
I'm going to try to get him to drop him now.

3140
02:58:51,571 --> 02:58:52,720
MATT: Okay.

3141
02:58:52,720 --> 02:58:56,603
TALIESIN: 16?

3142
02:58:56,603 --> 02:58:59,860
MATT: 16, okay. That hits.

3143
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:06,979
TALIESIN: All right, let me just make sure I'm
doing this right. Yeah, no damage

3144
02:59:06,979 --> 02:59:08,586
but he drops him.

3145
02:59:08,586 --> 02:59:14,684
MATT: Okay. Captain tumbles forward out of its
grasp onto the side. He's prone, but

3146
02:59:14,684 --> 02:59:16,840
he's no longer in the talons of the wyvern.

3147
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:20,386
TALIESIN: All right, and then I'm going to spend
the rest of my move getting up, getting situated,

3148
02:59:20,386 --> 02:59:24,058
and then moving a little bit, where's my--

3149
02:59:24,058 --> 02:59:28,468
MATT: Yeah, you have 15 more feet of movement when
you get up from-- Well actually, you weren't

3150
02:59:28,468 --> 02:59:30,514
knocked prone, you just slammed into the wall, so
you're fine.

3151
02:59:30,514 --> 02:59:32,568
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to move a little bit
further up the--

3152
02:59:32,568 --> 02:59:33,330
MATT: Here?

3153
02:59:33,330 --> 02:59:34,354
TALIESIN: Yeah, like right about there.

3154
02:59:34,354 --> 02:59:35,281
MATT: Okay.

3155
02:59:35,281 --> 02:59:36,774
LIAM: We just hit 4,000?

3156
02:59:36,774 --> 02:59:39,746
MATT: Are you serious?

3157
02:59:39,746 --> 02:59:41,577
MARISHA: We hit 4,000!

3158
02:59:41,577 --> 02:59:43,001
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3159
02:59:43,001 --> 02:59:44,998
MARISHA: Rap video.

3160
02:59:44,998 --> 02:59:47,068
MATT: You did this. You did this, Zac.

3161
02:59:47,068 --> 02:59:48,102
ZAC: I'm not happy about it.

3162
02:59:48,102 --> 02:59:49,852
(laughter)

3163
02:59:49,852 --> 02:59:50,910
MATT: You guys are ridiculous.

3164
02:59:50,910 --> 02:59:52,232
TALIESIN: Are you proud of yourself?

3165
02:59:52,232 --> 02:59:53,304
ZAC: No.

3166
02:59:53,304 --> 02:59:57,006
MATT: The Snugglelord outfit you're wearing tells
me otherwise.

3167
02:59:57,006 --> 02:59:58,271
TALIESIN: You look proud and majestic.

3168
02:59:58,271 --> 03:00:04,154
MATT: All right, no worries. So Percy, well done,
that's your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

3169
03:00:04,154 --> 03:00:08,286
SAM: Scanlan's going to take a few steps
forward--

3170
03:00:08,286 --> 03:00:12,209
MATT: You still have your hand up, by the way.
It's over in this area. You just took it and

3171
03:00:12,209 --> 03:00:13,456
twisted him, so you can manage to--

3172
03:00:13,456 --> 03:00:14,650
SAM: But he got out of it.

3173
03:00:14,650 --> 03:00:15,418
MATT: Yeah.

3174
03:00:15,418 --> 03:00:20,557
SAM: So I could... I'm going to leave it be. Oh
wait, I still have my hand out? And it's over there?

3175
03:00:20,557 --> 03:00:22,941
MATT: Well, I mean, your hand is over here where
you grabbed it earlier.

3176
03:00:22,941 --> 03:00:26,269
SAM: Can I move it to the other guy near the
ballista?

3177
03:00:26,269 --> 03:00:27,244
MATT: Over here?

3178
03:00:27,244 --> 03:00:28,021
SAM: Yeah.

3179
03:00:28,021 --> 03:00:28,793
MATT: Yeah.

3180
03:00:28,793 --> 03:00:31,032
SAM: Is that going to be my move, or do I also get
to use the hand?

3181
03:00:31,032 --> 03:00:33,181
MATT: No, that's just part of your action, so if
you wanted to use the hand you could--

3182
03:00:33,181 --> 03:00:38,632
SAM: Okay, I move it near the ballista guy and I
just go, boop. Push him over the edge.

3183
03:00:38,632 --> 03:00:41,097
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a roll and add
five to it.

3184
03:00:41,097 --> 03:00:45,956
SAM: It's through the--ooh. Not good, not good.

3185
03:00:45,956 --> 03:00:47,155
TALIESIN: Inspire yourself.

3186
03:00:47,155 --> 03:00:48,345
SAM: 14.

3187
03:00:48,345 --> 03:00:55,226
MATT: 14. As the creature's slammed into the wall,
the elf that's wrapped up currently is trying to

3188
03:00:55,226 --> 03:01:00,485
get ready. It starts preparing itself to do a
series of attacks, and your Bigby's Hand just

3189
03:01:00,485 --> 03:01:03,718
blindsides it, sending it over the edge of
the railing--

3190
03:01:03,718 --> 03:01:05,505
SAM: Oh, it worked!

3191
03:01:05,505 --> 03:01:13,381
MATT: Does not catch the railing. These guys, I
don't think they knew who was on that ship.

3192
03:01:13,381 --> 03:01:19,800
(falling scream) Gets flung off the edge, unable
to catch, and vanishes over the side of the ship.

3193
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:22,063
MARISHA: No, Wilhelm!

3194
03:01:22,063 --> 03:01:32,810
SAM: And then-- I'm going to move towards the
captain.

3195
03:01:32,810 --> 03:01:34,242
MATT: All right.

3196
03:01:34,242 --> 03:01:39,474
SAM: And-- Vax, are you in dire straits?
Physically?

3197
03:01:39,474 --> 03:01:40,971
LIAM: (strained) Yes.

3198
03:01:40,971 --> 03:01:44,743
SAM: Okay, then I'm going to throw some healing at
Vax with my Healing Word bonus action.

3199
03:01:44,743 --> 03:01:47,448
MATT: Yeah, you can get him in the range. Just
barely.

3200
03:01:47,448 --> 03:01:50,463
SAM: Healing Word of the day is, Heal!

3201
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:52,335
(laughter)

3202
03:01:52,335 --> 03:01:55,286
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll for him,
it's 1d4 plus five I believe.

3203
03:01:55,286 --> 03:01:59,611
MARISHA: It's like a word of the day calendar,
Healing Word of the day.

3204
03:01:59,611 --> 03:02:02,020
SAM: You got healed seven points, New Jersey.

3205
03:02:02,020 --> 03:02:03,980
MATT: Awesome.

3206
03:02:03,980 --> 03:02:06,122
LIAM: Ze goggles do nothing.

3207
03:02:06,122 --> 03:02:10,275
MATT: Ending Scanlan's turn. That was a rough
round for them. Pike, you're up.

3208
03:02:10,275 --> 03:02:11,806
LAURA: Come on, Pike.

3209
03:02:11,806 --> 03:02:13,026
ASHLEY: Okay.

3210
03:02:13,026 --> 03:02:18,716
MATT: No, it's concentration. Once you do Bigby's
Hand, you have it for as long as you concentrate.

3211
03:02:18,716 --> 03:02:20,402
ASHLEY: So.

3212
03:02:20,402 --> 03:02:21,521
MATT: Yes.

3213
03:02:21,521 --> 03:02:24,984
ASHLEY: I would like to try to create a Spiritual
Weapon.

3214
03:02:24,984 --> 03:02:26,067
MATT: All right.

3215
03:02:26,067 --> 03:02:29,221
ASHLEY: Kind of in the vein of--

3216
03:02:29,221 --> 03:02:32,403
MATT: You're a war cleric, now.

3217
03:02:32,403 --> 03:02:35,605
ASHLEY: -- Yondu's little arrow he would whistle
at.

3218
03:02:35,605 --> 03:02:36,830
MATT: Okay.

3219
03:02:36,830 --> 03:02:39,610
ASHLEY: But like a really big spear, like a big
version of that.

3220
03:02:39,610 --> 03:02:43,552
MATT: Okay, so what you do is you glance over at
the bolts that are set up as part of the

3221
03:02:43,552 --> 03:02:47,973
ballistae, and use that as a point of inspiration.
You cast Spiritual Weapon and you can see, from

3222
03:02:47,973 --> 03:02:53,822
the holy symbol, it glows at your chest and out of
it this giant piercing bolt just seems to appear

3223
03:02:53,822 --> 03:02:59,100
out of divine energy. Lifts itself aloft next to
you, just hovering in the air.

3224
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:02,330
ASHLEY: All right, so I want to pierce it through
that guy.

3225
03:03:02,330 --> 03:03:03,215
MATT: This guy?

3226
03:03:03,215 --> 03:03:04,017
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3227
03:03:04,017 --> 03:03:08,416
MATT: So as you see it there, you bring your hand
up and then make a flinging motion. It spins,

3228
03:03:08,416 --> 03:03:12,891
rotates, and then rockets off in the direction of
this wyvern. Go ahead and roll an attack with your

3229
03:03:12,891 --> 03:03:17,546
spell modifier.

3230
03:03:17,546 --> 03:03:21,492
LIAM: Kill kill kill kill kill.

3231
03:03:21,623 --> 03:03:22,635
ASHLEY: 18.

3232
03:03:22,635 --> 03:03:28,360
MATT: 18 definitely hits. All right, so for the
bolt's damage in the speed of this, and given the

3233
03:03:28,360 --> 03:03:39,769
flight, I would say roll 2d6 plus five damage.

3234
03:03:39,769 --> 03:03:44,684
LIAM: (sings)

3235
03:03:44,764 --> 03:03:46,524
ASHLEY: Seven.

3236
03:03:46,524 --> 03:03:49,205
MATT: Total seven? All right. Aw.

3237
03:03:49,205 --> 03:03:53,583
LAURA: All of those dice are bad. You need all-new
dice.

3238
03:03:53,583 --> 03:03:59,695
ASHLEY: I know, I mean, because of how heavy it
is-- but wait, I want to do it at a higher level.

3239
03:03:59,695 --> 03:04:01,475
MATT: Okay, what higher level do you want to
do it?

3240
03:04:01,475 --> 03:04:04,421
ASHLEY: I was thinking of doing it at a level
four.

3241
03:04:04,499 --> 03:04:05,531
MATT: All right.

3242
03:04:05,531 --> 03:04:10,644
ASHLEY: And I know that does 1d8, but then was it
just 1d6 because--

3243
03:04:10,644 --> 03:04:13,841
MATT: It was 2d6-- well what does the damage say
on there normally?

3244
03:04:13,841 --> 03:04:15,715
ASHLEY: One more time?

3245
03:04:15,715 --> 03:04:17,540
MATT: What's the damage it says on there.

3246
03:04:17,540 --> 03:04:22,311
ASHLEY: Spell using a slot of third level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two

3247
03:04:22,311 --> 03:04:23,960
slot levels above 2nd.

3248
03:04:23,960 --> 03:04:25,474
MATT: And what level is it normally?

3249
03:04:25,474 --> 03:04:26,356
LAURA: Three.

3250
03:04:26,356 --> 03:04:27,462
ASHLEY: It's a three. Or no, it's a two.

3251
03:04:27,462 --> 03:04:28,754
MATT: It's a two, so you're casting it at fourth
level.

3252
03:04:28,754 --> 03:04:29,667
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3253
03:04:29,667 --> 03:04:31,145
MATT: Which means you roll an additional 1d8.

3254
03:04:31,145 --> 03:04:33,193
LAURA: Don't roll that. Roll one of these.

3255
03:04:33,193 --> 03:04:37,175
LAURA: Yeah!

3256
03:04:37,175 --> 03:04:38,524
MATT: What's that?

3257
03:04:38,524 --> 03:04:39,812
ASHLEY: Okay, so it would be 15 total.

3258
03:04:39,812 --> 03:04:40,820
MATT: 15 total, nice.

3259
03:04:40,820 --> 03:04:45,672
ASHLEY: But then would the, since, so then would I
roll the d8 instead of the sixes

3260
03:04:45,672 --> 03:04:47,557
for that last one?

3261
03:04:47,557 --> 03:04:52,038
MATT: I would say given the fact that it's a
ranged bolt, it would be-- is it normally just 1d8

3262
03:04:52,038 --> 03:04:53,764
for the damage it deals?

3263
03:04:53,764 --> 03:04:54,729
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3264
03:04:54,729 --> 03:04:56,730
MATT: I made it 2d6 because it's a larger weapon
and you're using it as a bolt.

3265
03:04:56,730 --> 03:04:57,867
ASHLEY: All right, I understand.

3266
03:04:57,867 --> 03:04:59,310
MATT: So it did more damage circumstantially than
it normally would.

3267
03:04:59,310 --> 03:05:00,162
ASHLEY: Okay.

3268
03:05:00,162 --> 03:05:05,982
MATT: You're fine. All right, so that ends Pike's
turn. Brings us up to the top. Vex. You're like on

3269
03:05:06,033 --> 03:05:08,877
the side right now. You're in theory prone on the
side of the ship but you're not falling.

3270
03:05:08,877 --> 03:05:12,181
LAURA: Oh, so I can't attack? If I get up and
out.

3271
03:05:12,181 --> 03:05:14,704
MATT: Well no, you use half your movement to get
back onto the ship.

3272
03:05:14,704 --> 03:05:18,750
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to like brace my foot on
Grog's shoulder and climb up.

3273
03:05:18,750 --> 03:05:20,087
MARISHA: Nice.

3274
03:05:20,087 --> 03:05:23,487
MATT: All right. So she uses you as a footstool
and flips over, lands on top of the ship,

3275
03:05:23,487 --> 03:05:24,969
totally fine.

3276
03:05:24,969 --> 03:05:34,213
LAURA: Awesome. Can I shoot my grappling arrow at
this bastard here at the end of the ship? Is that

3277
03:05:34,213 --> 03:05:35,858
far enough? Is that close enough?

3278
03:05:35,858 --> 03:05:36,687
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

3279
03:05:36,687 --> 03:05:39,391
LAURA: All right, I want to shoot it at the rider,
I want to shoot the grappling arrow at the rider.

3280
03:05:39,391 --> 03:05:41,085
And I'll catch him and bring him in.

3281
03:05:41,085 --> 03:05:43,306
MATT: All right. So you reach in and there's--

3282
03:05:43,306 --> 03:05:45,358
LAURA: Oh, cast Hunter's Mark on him first,
though.

3283
03:05:45,358 --> 03:05:49,123
MATT: So you move it over.

3284
03:05:49,123 --> 03:05:52,027
LAURA: Yeah, that fucking, yeah.

3285
03:05:52,027 --> 03:05:54,195
MATT: It's there, Hunter's Mark is there, we're
fine.

3286
03:05:54,195 --> 03:05:56,899
LAURA: Yeah, it's on it, yay.

3287
03:05:56,899 --> 03:05:59,352
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for the attack
as you pull back the grappling arrow.

3288
03:05:59,352 --> 03:06:02,285
LAURA: Oh god, okay. So nervous.

3289
03:06:02,285 --> 03:06:03,983
TALIESIN: I'm counting on you.

3290
03:06:03,983 --> 03:06:05,357
ORION: Hit it!

3291
03:06:05,357 --> 03:06:07,907
LAURA: Yes. 26.

3292
03:06:07,907 --> 03:06:09,358
MATT: 26 definitely hits.

3293
03:06:09,358 --> 03:06:11,056
LAURA: Okay. So how do I do it?

3294
03:06:11,056 --> 03:06:12,594
MATT: All right. So roll damage.

3295
03:06:12,594 --> 03:06:13,427
LAURA: Okay.

3296
03:06:13,427 --> 03:06:22,604
MATT: It's actually-- for the grappling arrow it's
going to be 1d6 damage for it. It's not quite as

3297
03:06:22,682 --> 03:06:27,308
designed to pierce more than it's more of a
bludgeoning hit. Plus your--

3298
03:06:27,308 --> 03:06:28,354
LAURA: Plus my regular?

3299
03:06:28,354 --> 03:06:29,612
MATT: Yeah.

3300
03:06:29,612 --> 03:06:30,736
LAURA: 13.

3301
03:06:30,736 --> 03:06:32,206
MATT: So 13 damage to the rider, all right.

3302
03:06:32,206 --> 03:06:33,965
LAURA: Plus six for the Hunter's Mark. One.

3303
03:06:33,965 --> 03:06:35,965
MATT: All right.

3304
03:06:35,965 --> 03:06:40,304
LAURA: And then I've got him grappled?

3305
03:06:40,353 --> 03:06:46,560
MATT: And so as the arrow hits, it pierces the
shoulder for a second, it causes it to push off

3306
03:06:46,560 --> 03:06:52,242
the shoulder as it retracts behind it. You pull
back and it catches the shoulder. You're yanking?

3307
03:06:52,242 --> 03:06:54,183
LAURA: Yeah, for my second action I want to pull
him off.

3308
03:06:54,183 --> 03:06:56,136
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an athletics
check.

3309
03:06:56,136 --> 03:06:56,921
LAURA: Okay.

3310
03:06:56,921 --> 03:06:57,755
MARISHA: Nice!

3311
03:06:57,755 --> 03:06:58,523
TALIESIN: Yes!

3312
03:06:58,523 --> 03:06:59,465
MARISHA: Tug-of-war.

3313
03:06:59,465 --> 03:07:00,543
TALIESIN: Batman.

3314
03:07:00,543 --> 03:07:01,693
MARISHA: Batman.

3315
03:07:01,693 --> 03:07:05,035
SAM: You've got inspiration.

3316
03:07:05,035 --> 03:07:12,315
LAURA: Oh, well, okay. 16. Should I use my
inspiration? Yeah?

3317
03:07:12,315 --> 03:07:13,713
TRAVIS: Do it!

3318
03:07:13,713 --> 03:07:14,839
MARISHA: Do it!

3319
03:07:14,839 --> 03:07:16,731
LAURA: Okay, so that's 23.

3320
03:07:16,731 --> 03:07:21,766
MATT: 23. So using the inspiration that Scanlan
had given you, you grab the arrow and yank with

3321
03:07:21,766 --> 03:07:26,579
all your might. The tiny halfling form on there
clutches for dear life onto the harness that is on

3322
03:07:26,579 --> 03:07:31,963
top of this wyvern, but it's not enough as its
fingers are pulled from its grip and it's yanked

3323
03:07:31,963 --> 03:07:37,452
off the front, toppling ass over teakettle,
landing prone on the ground next to the captain

3324
03:07:37,452 --> 03:07:39,271
that it attempted to fling from the side of the
ship.

3325
03:07:39,271 --> 03:07:40,360
LAURA: Yes!

3326
03:07:40,360 --> 03:07:42,482
MATT: Grappling hook partially embedded in the
back of its shoulder blade.

3327
03:07:42,482 --> 03:07:43,511
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

3328
03:07:43,511 --> 03:07:44,564
ASHLEY: Yeah!

3329
03:07:44,564 --> 03:07:46,200
LAURA: I'm still holding the rope-- holding on.

3330
03:07:46,200 --> 03:07:50,222
MATT: You are, yes. All right.

3331
03:07:50,222 --> 03:07:52,147
LAURA: That's my whole action, right? That's
everything I can do?

3332
03:07:52,147 --> 03:07:54,708
MATT: That would be your action, yeah. That whole
process.

3333
03:07:54,708 --> 03:07:56,775
LAURA: Okay.

3334
03:07:56,775 --> 03:08:00,032
SAM: (sings) This is the music that plays when
things get really exciting.

3335
03:08:00,032 --> 03:08:07,719
MATT: (laughs) All right. This guard comes over
here, returns to his base where he had set up. The

3336
03:08:07,719 --> 03:08:11,453
griffon is right there in front of him. He gets
the bolt that's been set up there, aims it up, and

3337
03:08:11,453 --> 03:08:14,333
is going to fire almost point-blank into the
griffon as it turns around.

3338
03:08:14,333 --> 03:08:15,921
SAM: And he misses.

3339
03:08:15,921 --> 03:08:16,886
MARISHA: Come on.

3340
03:08:16,886 --> 03:08:17,891
MATT: That's a natural 20.

3341
03:08:17,891 --> 03:08:19,031
(cheering)

3342
03:08:19,031 --> 03:08:20,278
TALIESIN: Way to go, nameless guard!

3343
03:08:20,278 --> 03:08:21,425
LAURA: Yeah, go NPC!

3344
03:08:21,425 --> 03:08:22,920
MATT: And 2d6, double sixes.

3345
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:27,500
MARISHA: You're a badass, nameless NPC.

3346
03:08:27,500 --> 03:08:34,728
MATT: So as the guard turns around and releases
the bolt, the griffon is flying up over the edge

3347
03:08:34,728 --> 03:08:39,269
of the ship, getting away from the buffeting winds
of the druid. As it turns around, a bolt just

3348
03:08:39,269 --> 03:08:44,528
pierces its chest, the sheer impact sending it
flying backward as it screeches, plummets off the

3349
03:08:44,528 --> 03:08:49,923
side of the ship to slowly find itself to its doom
in the watery grave below in the ocean.

3350
03:08:49,923 --> 03:08:51,593
LAURA: Next to a tiny rabbit swimming around.

3351
03:08:51,593 --> 03:08:59,882
MATT: Next to a tiny rabbit. That griffon took a
bolt to its chest, that is nasty. All right. This

3352
03:08:59,882 --> 03:09:02,486
other guard is going to--

3353
03:09:02,486 --> 03:09:06,322
LAURA: And the Hunter's Mark is on the little
halfling thing, not the wyvern, just so you know.

3354
03:09:06,322 --> 03:09:08,040
MATT: Yes.

3355
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:15,002
LAURA: Oh no, our music went away again.

3356
03:09:15,002 --> 03:09:17,811
MARISHA: Is that like the only track we have?

3357
03:09:18,030 --> 03:09:20,433
MATT: One track is having problems with
audio, apparently. I'll fix it later.

3358
03:09:20,433 --> 03:09:23,136
SAM: Matt, do everything now.

3359
03:09:23,136 --> 03:09:26,536
MATT: I know. By the way, we have some great audio
tracks that some fans have sent that I'm going to

3360
03:09:26,536 --> 03:09:28,047
be incorporating into our playlist soon.

3361
03:09:28,047 --> 03:09:28,820
LAURA: Oh, that's cool!

3362
03:09:28,820 --> 03:09:31,173
MATT: So if any of you guys are musicians and you
want to create music for the show, feel free to

3363
03:09:31,173 --> 03:09:35,783
send it to us. You know, atmospheric, not too
dynamic, you've heard the types we have on here,

3364
03:09:35,783 --> 03:09:37,637
so in that realm, please send it.

3365
03:09:37,637 --> 03:09:39,028
SAM: Polka, polka. Lots of polka.

3366
03:09:39,028 --> 03:09:41,301
TRAVIS: Slow jams.

3367
03:09:41,301 --> 03:09:42,851
LAURA: Slow jams for Scanlan in the boudoir.

3368
03:09:42,851 --> 03:09:44,460
LIAM: Ska, we've been getting a lot of ska.

3369
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:45,525
TALIESIN: Dubstep.

3370
03:09:45,525 --> 03:09:46,792
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

3371
03:09:46,792 --> 03:09:49,398
LIAM: I'm having trouble seeing through the fog of
war, a.k.a. my iPad. How close is

3372
03:09:49,398 --> 03:09:51,168
that wyvern to me?

3373
03:09:51,168 --> 03:09:54,692
MATT: Right there? He is only ten, 11 feet from
you.

3374
03:09:54,692 --> 03:09:58,646
LIAM: All right. Okay, so straight up,
dagger-dagger-dagger.

3375
03:09:58,646 --> 03:09:59,846
MATT: All right.

3376
03:09:59,846 --> 03:10:01,747
LIAM: Do I have advantage?

3377
03:10:01,747 --> 03:10:03,606
MATT: No, you do not have advantage. It is
flying.

3378
03:10:03,783 --> 03:10:05,716
LIAM: All right, that's 20 on the first with my
keen.

3379
03:10:05,716 --> 03:10:07,149
MATT: That hits.

3380
03:10:07,149 --> 03:10:13,620
LIAM: Hits. That is ten points of damage. Second
dagger, 25.

3381
03:10:13,620 --> 03:10:15,240
MATT: That hits.

3382
03:10:15,240 --> 03:10:22,864
LIAM: That is seven points of damage, and my third
dagger, all the way from New Jersey, is a 20.

3383
03:10:22,864 --> 03:10:24,093
MATT: That hits.

3384
03:10:24,093 --> 03:10:25,639
SAM: Trenton.

3385
03:10:25,639 --> 03:10:29,352
LIAM: They were really all ones. That is a ten.

3386
03:10:29,352 --> 03:10:33,618
MATT: Ten damage, all right. So as you just manage
to catch yourself on the edge of the ship as it's

3387
03:10:33,618 --> 03:10:37,785
listing. From this angle, the wyvern that pushed
off the side is now flapping its wings and

3388
03:10:37,785 --> 03:10:42,010
preparing its claws to go for another dive attack.
You reach back and your daggers, which have

3389
03:10:42,010 --> 03:10:47,619
returned to your belt, you fling
all three as they spiral through the air. First

3390
03:10:47,619 --> 03:10:52,567
one strikes its torso, the second one hits it in
the neck, and as it rears up, looking at you angrily

3391
03:10:52,567 --> 03:10:56,911
with its fangs bared like it's now changed its
direction towards you, the final one hits it in

3392
03:10:56,972 --> 03:11:01,091
the head. Plummets backward.

3393
03:11:01,091 --> 03:11:04,911
LIAM: That's how we do it in Weehawken, New Jersey
motherfucker!

3394
03:11:04,981 --> 03:11:10,635
MATT: All right. Vax, do you want to move, are you
good there?

3395
03:11:10,635 --> 03:11:21,858
LIAM: I am going to-- no I'm going to jog
backwards towards the-- I can't see. Who's around

3396
03:11:21,858 --> 03:11:24,812
the wyvern up at the end of the boat?

3397
03:11:24,812 --> 03:11:25,678
TRAVIS: Nobody.

3398
03:11:25,678 --> 03:11:26,611
SAM: Scanlan? Oh.

3399
03:11:26,611 --> 03:11:27,538
MATT: Nobody over here.

3400
03:11:27,538 --> 03:11:28,494
TRAVIS: Nobody's at the front.

3401
03:11:28,494 --> 03:11:29,505
LIAM: Nobody at the back?

3402
03:11:29,505 --> 03:11:30,361
SAM: The back?

3403
03:11:30,361 --> 03:11:31,182
MATT: No, there is--

3404
03:11:31,182 --> 03:11:32,197
LAURA: A little halfling dude.

3405
03:11:32,197 --> 03:11:34,213
MATT: One of the bandits is still there on the
side of the ship.

3406
03:11:34,213 --> 03:11:36,701
LIAM: I have a potion, I'm going to drink it.

3407
03:11:36,701 --> 03:11:37,760
MATT: All right, go for it.

3408
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:39,852
MARISHA: Is that bandit hanging on, is that the
deal?

3409
03:11:39,852 --> 03:11:43,391
MATT: Technically it's an action to drink it, but
it's fine, I'll let you do it.

3410
03:11:43,391 --> 03:11:44,968
LAURA: You're in New Jersey.

3411
03:11:44,968 --> 03:11:48,758
LIAM: No no no, I don't want to do that. No, I
definitely don't want to do that. I'm going to run

3412
03:11:48,758 --> 03:11:51,347
over by-- I'm going to run back by Keyleth.

3413
03:11:51,347 --> 03:11:58,480
MATT: Okay. With Haste, you get there easily.
Keyleth, who is just a buffeting wind cyclone.

3414
03:11:58,545 --> 03:12:03,477
MARISHA: Come be protected by my sweet wind gusts,
yo.

3415
03:12:03,477 --> 03:12:04,997
MATT: Tiberius, you're up.

3416
03:12:04,997 --> 03:12:06,843
ORION: Okay. I take my staff--

3417
03:12:06,843 --> 03:12:08,133
MATT: Get up to your feet, yep.

3418
03:12:08,133 --> 03:12:17,766
ORION: -- push myself up. I'll-- I don't know,
guys, I don't--

3419
03:12:17,820 --> 03:12:20,538
LAURA: Do something to that big wyvern. Get rid of
him.

3420
03:12:20,538 --> 03:12:22,233
MATT: The entire ship is right here listing on the
side.

3421
03:12:22,233 --> 03:12:22,966
MARISHA: Yeah.

3422
03:12:22,966 --> 03:12:23,910
ORION: Get rid of the wyvern?

3423
03:12:23,910 --> 03:12:24,959
LIAM: Do something amazing.

3424
03:12:24,959 --> 03:12:26,173
LAURA: All we've got are two little bandits after
that.

3425
03:12:26,173 --> 03:12:27,940
SAM: Just do the best move you've ever done in
your life.

3426
03:12:27,940 --> 03:12:36,972
ORION: Okay. I'm going to-- first I'll do
Telekinesis again to attempt to do what I did the

3427
03:12:36,972 --> 03:12:42,077
first time. Nothing fancy because whatever, and
I'll try and rip off the wyvern's wings again from

3428
03:12:42,077 --> 03:12:43,768
his body.

3429
03:12:43,768 --> 03:12:44,819
MATT: Okay.

3430
03:12:44,819 --> 03:12:46,496
ORION: Or one of them, if it's easier.

3431
03:12:46,496 --> 03:12:48,593
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a roll.

3432
03:12:48,593 --> 03:12:49,891
TRAVIS: Yeah, one would do it.

3433
03:12:49,891 --> 03:12:51,176
MARISHA: True.

3434
03:12:51,176 --> 03:12:56,151
ORION: That is 22.

3435
03:12:56,151 --> 03:13:02,551
MATT: 22. Okay. Go ahead and roll 3d6 points of
damage. You don't manage to tear the wing off, but

3436
03:13:02,551 --> 03:13:07,914
you do manage to pull its flesh, and you can see
you've caused the joint where it's attached now

3437
03:13:07,965 --> 03:13:11,517
tearing open, revealing bone and fleshy tissue
beneath.

3438
03:13:11,517 --> 03:13:15,874
ORION: That'll be nine, ten.

3439
03:13:15,874 --> 03:13:18,750
MARISHA: That's like the most average, that was
like exactly average.

3440
03:13:18,750 --> 03:13:20,207
ORION: Yeah. Ten.

3441
03:13:20,207 --> 03:13:21,689
MATT: It's tearing open.

3442
03:13:21,689 --> 03:13:28,230
ORION: And I see that and I turn to Vax and I go,
I like what you were doing earlier. And I spend

3443
03:13:28,230 --> 03:13:35,013
five sorcerer points, I cast Telekinesis again,
and I take out eight of the daggers that are in my

3444
03:13:35,013 --> 03:13:42,150
pouch and I hover them around me and then I start
(stabbing noises) towards the wyvern where I see

3445
03:13:42,150 --> 03:13:44,072
all the bone shit is.

3446
03:13:44,072 --> 03:13:45,376
MARISHA: He's making sushi.

3447
03:13:45,376 --> 03:13:49,443
ORION: And I'm hucking my-- back and forth,
bringing them back and forth.

3448
03:13:49,443 --> 03:13:51,501
MATT: Just so you're aware, Telekinesis is a
concentration spell, you don't have to keep

3449
03:13:51,501 --> 03:13:52,871
recasting it.

3450
03:13:52,871 --> 03:13:54,339
ORION: Oh, I don't? It's just going?

3451
03:13:54,339 --> 03:13:55,477
MATT: Yeah.

3452
03:13:55,477 --> 03:14:00,656
ORION: Oh, well then. Fucking that's what's going
on, and I spend five to do it again.

3453
03:14:00,656 --> 03:14:02,314
MATT: Just letting you know. Okay.

3454
03:14:02,314 --> 03:14:03,928
ORION: Because can I do that all in one action? Do
that and then with the daggers?

3455
03:14:03,928 --> 03:14:09,246
MATT: I mean, no no. To do the daggers you would
have to cast it again, the sorcerer points give

3456
03:14:09,246 --> 03:14:10,394
you another action.

3457
03:14:10,394 --> 03:14:11,608
ORION: That's okay, so I did it right.

3458
03:14:11,608 --> 03:14:12,511
MATT: All right.

3459
03:14:12,511 --> 03:14:13,445
ORION: Yeah, so.

3460
03:14:13,445 --> 03:14:16,112
MATT: But it wouldn't use another expenditure, yeah.
Normally you can just concentrate each round, do

3461
03:14:16,180 --> 03:14:17,252
an action with it, so.

3462
03:14:17,252 --> 03:14:18,268
ORION: Got it.

3463
03:14:18,268 --> 03:14:19,803
MATT: All right, so you just fling all the daggers
at it?

3464
03:14:19,803 --> 03:14:24,257
ORION: Yeah, and I'm pulling them back and forth
through that tear in the wing

3465
03:14:24,257 --> 03:14:26,214
which I just caused.

3466
03:14:26,214 --> 03:14:32,932
MATT: Okay. I'll say, go ahead and make four spell
attack rolls. So roll a d20, adding your spell

3467
03:14:32,987 --> 03:14:34,878
attack modifier.

3468
03:14:34,878 --> 03:14:35,951
ORION: Four times?

3469
03:14:35,951 --> 03:14:42,001
MATT: Yeah. So whatever your spell attack modifier
is.

3470
03:14:42,001 --> 03:14:47,170
ORION: So my attack modifier is, the spell attack
bonus, is that what I want?

3471
03:14:47,170 --> 03:14:48,116
MATT: Yeah.

3472
03:14:48,116 --> 03:14:52,831
ORION: That's 23, 24, 25, 26. And that's-- what is
that?

3473
03:14:52,831 --> 03:14:55,371
SAM: Wait, is it just the d20 plus the modifier?

3474
03:14:55,371 --> 03:14:56,382
MATT: Yeah.

3475
03:14:56,382 --> 03:14:57,328
SAM: Okay.

3476
03:14:57,328 --> 03:14:58,810
ORION: Yeah, and then 18 plus--

3477
03:14:58,810 --> 03:15:00,739
SAM: That's 20.

3478
03:15:00,739 --> 03:15:05,284
ORION: That's 30, 31, 32. Because I get plus three
on all attacks because of the gear I'm wearing

3479
03:15:05,284 --> 03:15:12,389
also. And then seven plus that is 18, 21, and then
that is 15, 17, 18.

3480
03:15:12,458 --> 03:15:14,185
LAURA: I have no idea what's happening anymore.

3481
03:15:14,185 --> 03:15:16,745
TRAVIS: That's a lot of numbers. Lot of numbers.

3482
03:15:16,745 --> 03:15:20,507
ORION: So my spell attack bonus is 11. Plus three
because of all the gear I have on.

3483
03:15:20,507 --> 03:15:21,893
ASHLEY: I'm getting a donut.

3484
03:15:21,893 --> 03:15:25,934
ORION: On top of those. That goes to my spell
attack bonus. Which is what this is, right?

3485
03:15:25,934 --> 03:15:30,428
MATT: Right, well, your bonus is, it's your
proficiency modifier plus your stat modifier,

3486
03:15:30,428 --> 03:15:35,388
which is your charisma, which is five, and your
proficiency, which is four. So it would be nine.

3487
03:15:35,388 --> 03:15:38,051
ORION: So how do I have-- oh! I'm sorry.

3488
03:15:38,051 --> 03:15:39,304
MARISHA: Maybe you were counting this in.

3489
03:15:39,304 --> 03:15:41,928
ORION: I'm counting this in. So minus one from all
those totals.

3490
03:15:41,928 --> 03:15:51,585
MATT: That's okay, they all still hit. So go ahead
and roll 4d4 plus 20. As each dagger is now being

3491
03:15:51,585 --> 03:15:56,656
jammed into the creature's open wound through the
power of your telekinetic force.

3492
03:15:56,656 --> 03:16:03,603
ORION: That's-- three, 13, eight? Eight?

3493
03:16:03,603 --> 03:16:05,537
MATT: 20, total of 28.

3494
03:16:05,537 --> 03:16:07,497
ORION: Okay, yeah, 28.

3495
03:16:07,497 --> 03:16:12,907
MATT: Takes plus five to each, so 28 points of
damage. As its wing is being torn apart, the

3496
03:16:12,907 --> 03:16:16,784
daggers do streak through, many of which are
missing its form as you're just flinging them all

3497
03:16:16,784 --> 03:16:21,145
at it, and then as they go straight past it, you
turn the Telekinesis back and you yank them back

3498
03:16:21,145 --> 03:16:25,179
through. As they tear through, you see most of the
wing is torn open and the flesh is now just

3499
03:16:25,179 --> 03:16:29,956
exposed to the air, the wind's buffeting it
around. It's looking extremely rough and is

3500
03:16:29,956 --> 03:16:34,888
beginning-- it's on the ground currently, but it
looks like it's not going to be able to fly right

3501
03:16:34,888 --> 03:16:37,428
now. It is completely incapable of flight with the
way you damaged the wing.

3502
03:16:37,428 --> 03:16:43,763
ORION: As I see this, I'm going to just hover all
the daggers over the prone dude and right over his

3503
03:16:43,763 --> 03:16:45,215
face to keep him there.

3504
03:16:45,215 --> 03:16:46,916
MATT: All right. Grog.

3505
03:16:46,916 --> 03:16:50,422
TRAVIS: I pull myself back up on the ship.

3506
03:16:50,422 --> 03:16:52,559
MATT: Okay, so that's half your movement, you
still have 20 feet of movement.

3507
03:16:52,559 --> 03:16:57,178
TRAVIS: I look up and I see that everyone's got
that wyvern taken care of, and I turn my gaze back

3508
03:16:57,178 --> 03:17:03,148
to that little halfling in front of Vex. I'd like
to move to him, please.

3509
03:17:03,148 --> 03:17:06,664
MATT: All right. He is ten feet up, so you're
going to have to make a couple-- two athletics

3510
03:17:06,664 --> 03:17:09,271
checks to leap up towards him in your rage.

3511
03:17:09,271 --> 03:17:10,777
SAM: Two athletics checks.

3512
03:17:10,777 --> 03:17:15,067
TRAVIS: Yes! Okay. 23?

3513
03:17:15,067 --> 03:17:16,942
MATT: All right, and the second one?

3514
03:17:16,942 --> 03:17:19,999
TRAVIS: Yes! Sorry. 19.

3515
03:17:19,999 --> 03:17:28,012
MATT: All right. Like a lumbering barbarian, you
get up on the thing and then just Hulk-jump twice,

3516
03:17:28,012 --> 03:17:30,290
landing next to it, as--

3517
03:17:30,290 --> 03:17:37,100
TRAVIS: Trembling, raging in the face, I reach and
I pick him up by the top of his shirt, give him a

3518
03:17:37,100 --> 03:17:40,726
sniff, and fucking chuck him off the side of the
ship.

3519
03:17:40,726 --> 03:17:43,327
MATT: All right. Make another athletics check to
try and grapple him.

3520
03:17:43,327 --> 03:17:52,601
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on strength checks when
I'm raging? Advantage on strength checks, strength

3521
03:17:52,601 --> 03:17:53,948
saving throws?

3522
03:17:53,948 --> 03:17:56,152
MATT: Does it give you bonuses, or advantage on
strength checks?

3523
03:17:56,152 --> 03:17:57,459
TRAVIS: Yes, when I rage. It says strength
checks.

3524
03:17:57,459 --> 03:17:58,459
MATT: Yeah, you would.

3525
03:17:58,459 --> 03:17:59,296
TRAVIS: Okay.

3526
03:17:59,296 --> 03:18:00,893
MATT: So yeah, you would have an advantage on
this.

3527
03:18:00,893 --> 03:18:04,858
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's even better, that's a 24.

3528
03:18:04,858 --> 03:18:11,422
MATT: 24. All right. So as you stand there with
your axe up, you set the axe down, reach out and

3529
03:18:11,422 --> 03:18:17,379
grab the halfling, who you see has this scarred
face and it looks really haggard for a halfling.

3530
03:18:17,379 --> 03:18:22,112
Its existence is not in the most comfortable
places, especially to be out in the middle of the

3531
03:18:22,112 --> 03:18:27,903
ocean like this. You grab it and for a moment its
anger, seething, turns to sudden fear as it looks

3532
03:18:27,903 --> 03:18:29,870
over the side.

3533
03:18:29,870 --> 03:18:31,905
TRAVIS: You fucked up!

3534
03:18:31,905 --> 03:18:34,558
MATT: And just goes plummeting off the side.

3535
03:18:34,558 --> 03:18:35,477
LAURA: Oh man.

3536
03:18:35,477 --> 03:18:37,164
TALIESIN: Poor life choices, yay!

3537
03:18:37,164 --> 03:18:39,035
MARISHA: Why did I get in this line of work?

3538
03:18:39,035 --> 03:18:41,038
TRAVIS: Can we interrogate the last one?

3539
03:18:41,038 --> 03:18:43,629
LAURA: Yeah, I think we don't attack the last
dude, just kill the wyvern.

3540
03:18:43,629 --> 03:18:45,015
TRAVIS: I'm good.

3541
03:18:45,015 --> 03:18:46,381
MATT: All right. Keyleth.

3542
03:18:46,381 --> 03:18:53,089
MARISHA: So everyone seems-- the only thing that's
left is the wyvern, right?

3543
03:18:53,089 --> 03:18:54,130
MATT: Currently.

3544
03:18:54,130 --> 03:18:56,067
LAURA: And one little halfling that I've got a
rope on.

3545
03:18:56,067 --> 03:19:00,686
MARISHA: Oh, one you've got a rope on? And is the
ship still like ahhh?

3546
03:19:00,686 --> 03:19:01,914
MATT: Still listing, yeah.

3547
03:19:01,914 --> 03:19:02,997
MARISHA: It's still a little crooked?

3548
03:19:02,997 --> 03:19:06,107
MATT: Yeah, it's still on the side, and it's
slowly rotating as there's nobody at the helm.

3549
03:19:06,107 --> 03:19:16,848
MARISHA: Okay. I, in my air form, I'm going to fly
over. I'll go through, and I'm going to use just

3550
03:19:16,848 --> 03:19:24,060
my air form to lift underneath of the boat and try
and stabilize it.

3551
03:19:24,060 --> 03:19:32,707
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check
using the air elemental's strength.

3552
03:19:32,707 --> 03:19:39,642
MARISHA: Okay. Use my air dice. Eight.

3553
03:19:39,642 --> 03:19:48,046
MATT: Using all the force of your elemental air,
you push and push, but this ship is extremely

3554
03:19:48,046 --> 03:19:51,356
heavy, and this side of it, all the weight,
because the two other sides are given essentially

3555
03:19:51,356 --> 03:19:55,958
an anti-gravity force from the arcane, all the
weight is being pushed into this one corner.

3556
03:19:55,958 --> 03:20:00,412
Outside of a natural 20, you would not be able to
help this at all, unfortunately.

3557
03:20:00,412 --> 03:20:02,471
MARISHA: Outside of a natural 20, wow.

3558
03:20:02,471 --> 03:20:03,759
LIAM: But maybe!

3559
03:20:03,759 --> 03:20:06,384
MATT: You never know, that could have been really
epic! That could've been really epic.

3560
03:20:06,384 --> 03:20:07,735
MARISHA: Cool.

3561
03:20:07,735 --> 03:20:10,635
SAM: Instead it was just okay.

3562
03:20:10,635 --> 03:20:13,337
MARISHA: Well, I learn that the boat's heavy as
shit.

3563
03:20:13,337 --> 03:20:14,601
MATT: Yeah you do.

3564
03:20:14,601 --> 03:20:16,520
MARISHA: That's what I learned this turn.

3565
03:20:16,520 --> 03:20:19,141
TALIESIN: In one of 20 dimensions, you're awesome
right now.

3566
03:20:19,141 --> 03:20:20,043
MARISHA: Thanks.

3567
03:20:20,043 --> 03:20:22,506
MATT: It's okay. You essentially one-shotted a
wyvern.

3568
03:20:22,506 --> 03:20:24,016
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

3569
03:20:24,016 --> 03:20:26,171
MATT: You bunny-one-shotted a wyvern.

3570
03:20:26,171 --> 03:20:28,998
MARISHA: Oh, it's okay, I don't need, you know,
comfort.

3571
03:20:28,998 --> 03:20:30,120
TRAVIS: Validation?

3572
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:31,097
MATT: I know.

3573
03:20:31,097 --> 03:20:33,601
MARISHA: Don't need validation. Save it for
Orion.

3574
03:20:33,601 --> 03:20:37,824
MATT: No, I just wanted to bring it up again. I
just wanted to bring it up again, because I think

3575
03:20:37,824 --> 03:20:39,537
it's the most ridiculous death to a wyvern ever.

3576
03:20:39,537 --> 03:20:41,189
ASHLEY: Death by bunny.

3577
03:20:41,189 --> 03:20:50,578
MATT: Okay. This wyvern, looking at the
circumstance, takes off. Tries to fly and can't.

3578
03:20:50,578 --> 03:20:52,384
TRAVIS: Oh, it can't fly?

3579
03:20:52,384 --> 03:20:58,983
MATT: No, because its wing is messed up from
Tiberius, so it steps around to the only thing it

3580
03:20:58,983 --> 03:21:00,657
can reach, which is you, Scanlan.

3581
03:21:00,657 --> 03:21:01,940
SAM: That's fine.

3582
03:21:01,940 --> 03:21:05,446
MATT: Coming at you with a bite and its stinger
again, because it can't use its claws. That is a--

3583
03:21:05,446 --> 03:21:09,943
SAM: And I sing my little Cutting Words song to--

3584
03:21:09,943 --> 03:21:11,484
MATT: Okay, against which attack?

3585
03:21:11,484 --> 03:21:12,278
SAM: I'm sorry?

3586
03:21:12,278 --> 03:21:13,079
MATT: Against which attack?

3587
03:21:13,079 --> 03:21:14,210
SAM: Oh, he has two attacks?

3588
03:21:14,210 --> 03:21:15,346
MATT: He has a bite and a stinger.

3589
03:21:15,346 --> 03:21:16,451
SAM: Against the stinger.

3590
03:21:16,451 --> 03:21:18,735
MATT: The bite is a 22 to hit.

3591
03:21:18,735 --> 03:21:19,714
SAM: Oh, he hits.

3592
03:21:19,714 --> 03:21:25,743
MATT: All right. You take 14 points of piercing
damage.

3593
03:21:25,743 --> 03:21:26,918
SAM: Okay.

3594
03:21:26,918 --> 03:21:28,264
LIAM: Scanlan!

3595
03:21:28,264 --> 03:21:33,734
MATT: Its entire mouth just opens up and clamps
down onto your shoulder and torso. As it's holding

3596
03:21:33,734 --> 03:21:40,046
you in place, you try and pull back as its tail
whips towards you. Go ahead and make your roll.

3597
03:21:40,046 --> 03:21:42,176
SAM: What do I roll?

3598
03:21:42,176 --> 03:21:45,463
MATT: Roll a d10, and that's whatever the attack
is reduced by.

3599
03:21:45,463 --> 03:21:47,635
ORION: That's an eight.

3600
03:21:47,635 --> 03:21:48,711
MATT: d10.

3601
03:21:48,711 --> 03:21:52,303
ORION: That's d10. Yes! That's ten!

3602
03:21:52,303 --> 03:21:53,129
SAM: Zero?

3603
03:21:53,129 --> 03:21:54,042
MATT: That's ten.

3604
03:21:54,042 --> 03:21:55,317
SAM: Ten, okay. Ten.

3605
03:21:55,317 --> 03:21:58,648
MATT: All right. So it rolled a 24 to hit.

3606
03:21:58,648 --> 03:22:00,055
SAM: That goes down to 14.

3607
03:22:00,055 --> 03:22:00,787
MATT: To 14.

3608
03:22:00,787 --> 03:22:01,923
SAM: My armor class is 15.

3609
03:22:01,923 --> 03:22:03,475
TRAVIS: Yeah, amazing!

3610
03:22:03,475 --> 03:22:04,669
ORION: Your armor class is 17.

3611
03:22:04,669 --> 03:22:06,555
SAM: I'm also wearing a necklace which makes it
17.

3612
03:22:06,555 --> 03:22:07,525
MARISHA: Your armor class is 17.

3613
03:22:07,525 --> 03:22:08,813
ORION: Your armor class is 17.

3614
03:22:08,813 --> 03:22:09,863
MATT: Oh, snap.

3615
03:22:09,863 --> 03:22:11,131
SAM: So I'm okay. From that.

3616
03:22:11,131 --> 03:22:12,421
MARISHA: Did you write that down?

3617
03:22:12,421 --> 03:22:15,606
SAM: Well I wrote the armor and then there was
apparently some necklace that I forgot about.

3618
03:22:15,606 --> 03:22:20,585
ORION: Yeah, he's had a plus two and the armor,
plus three to his AC, which was 14, so that's 17.

3619
03:22:20,585 --> 03:22:21,728
LAURA: Seriously?

3620
03:22:21,728 --> 03:22:23,270
SAM: Amulet of Natural Armor, I didn't realize. I
can give it--

3621
03:22:23,270 --> 03:22:24,536
MARISHA: I know, I don't feel bad about taking the
ring.

3622
03:22:24,536 --> 03:22:31,148
MATT: Well, fair enough. So, as it's clamping down
on you, its tail whips in the air-- what words are

3623
03:22:31,148 --> 03:22:32,545
you going to throw?

3624
03:22:32,545 --> 03:22:40,442
SAM: (sings) And you miss me like the deserts
miss the rain.

3625
03:22:40,442 --> 03:22:45,251
MATT: The wyvern, who is still clamped down on
your body, its one eye opens up and goes, you hear

3626
03:22:45,251 --> 03:22:53,160
an audible (hruh?). And as its tail swings towards
you, it just hits the ground next to you, slamming

3627
03:22:53,160 --> 03:22:58,062
into the wood. Entirely distracted by your sudden
lack of fear and display of beautiful musical

3628
03:22:58,062 --> 03:23:03,225
voice. Misses you. That ends its turn. Percy,
you're up.

3629
03:23:03,225 --> 03:23:08,563
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking out the Pepperbox.
I'm going to turn towards it, and just unload.

3630
03:23:08,563 --> 03:23:09,969
MATT: All right, go for it.

3631
03:23:09,969 --> 03:23:11,597
ORION: Shoot that load, Percy.

3632
03:23:11,597 --> 03:23:13,044
LIAM: Finish it.

3633
03:23:13,044 --> 03:23:14,396
LAURA: Yes.

3634
03:23:14,396 --> 03:23:16,231
MARISHA: Unleash that load.

3635
03:23:16,231 --> 03:23:17,331
TALIESIN: Ten.

3636
03:23:17,331 --> 03:23:18,426
ORION: Damn it, I wasn't--

3637
03:23:18,426 --> 03:23:19,713
MATT: Ten? Total ten?

3638
03:23:19,713 --> 03:23:20,583
TALIESIN: Total ten.

3639
03:23:20,583 --> 03:23:21,573
MATT: Nope.

3640
03:23:21,573 --> 03:23:23,962
LIAM: You're the closer, Percy.

3641
03:23:23,962 --> 03:23:24,953
TALIESIN: 22.

3642
03:23:24,953 --> 03:23:25,932
LAURA: Yeah.

3643
03:23:25,932 --> 03:23:27,810
MATT: That hits. You only get two attacks,
though.

3644
03:23:27,810 --> 03:23:28,976
TALIESIN: I'm using my bonus action.

3645
03:23:28,976 --> 03:23:30,618
MATT: Oh, you mean you're using your action
surge?

3646
03:23:30,618 --> 03:23:31,556
TALIESIN: Using my action surge.

3647
03:23:31,556 --> 03:23:33,092
MATT: Okay. So you get four attacks.

3648
03:23:33,092 --> 03:23:38,180
TALIESIN: That misses. And then 19.

3649
03:23:38,180 --> 03:23:39,571
MATT: That's two hits.

3650
03:23:39,571 --> 03:23:45,071
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's two hits. I was also using
my sharpshooter mode for that so that I can do

3651
03:23:45,071 --> 03:23:50,508
some extra damage, and that's... Number one,
that's--

3652
03:23:50,508 --> 03:23:52,293
LAURA: Kill all the things.

3653
03:23:52,293 --> 03:23:55,354
TALIESIN: 20 points of damage plus one point of
ice damage.

3654
03:23:55,354 --> 03:23:56,824
MATT: All righty.

3655
03:23:56,824 --> 03:23:59,030
SAM: It's the ice damage that's going to do it.

3656
03:23:59,030 --> 03:24:00,120
MARISHA: Yeah.

3657
03:24:00,120 --> 03:24:01,886
TALIESIN: And the next one is--

3658
03:24:01,886 --> 03:24:03,190
SAM: Ooh, cold.

3659
03:24:03,190 --> 03:24:06,780
LAURA: Ooh, it's a little chilly.

3660
03:24:06,780 --> 03:24:09,623
TALIESIN: 25 points of damage and one point of
fire damage.

3661
03:24:09,623 --> 03:24:10,875
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3662
03:24:10,875 --> 03:24:12,151
(cheering)

3663
03:24:12,151 --> 03:24:13,194
TRAVIS: The closer!

3664
03:24:13,194 --> 03:24:14,334
MARISHA: The closer.

3665
03:24:14,334 --> 03:24:17,114
TALIESIN: Western-style, I'm just going to--

3666
03:24:17,114 --> 03:24:19,121
TRAVIS: Yeah, fan the fucking hammer.

3667
03:24:19,121 --> 03:24:21,617
TALIESIN: I'm going to fan the hammer, I'm going
to just tear that wing off.

3668
03:24:21,617 --> 03:24:25,950
MATT: So with each successive blast, even the ones
that don't immediately impact, the first blast

3669
03:24:25,950 --> 03:24:30,294
hits and explodes across its shoulder
joint, as you see the rest of the flesh that

3670
03:24:30,294 --> 03:24:34,705
Tiberius had already weakened gets severed
entirely, the wing flung off the side of the ship

3671
03:24:34,705 --> 03:24:39,157
and disappearing in the wind beneath. As it rears
back in pain, the second one hits its side, the

3672
03:24:39,157 --> 03:24:44,052
third one strikes it on the other wing, and as it
rears back in pain, its mouth open to the sky in

3673
03:24:44,052 --> 03:24:49,127
this screeching death-rattle, the final blast hits
it under the chin, leaving a gaping hole

3674
03:24:49,127 --> 03:24:56,229
under its neck as it steps back and then tumbles
off the edge of the ship, vanishing below.

3675
03:24:56,229 --> 03:24:57,714
TRAVIS: Attacked the wrong ship.

3676
03:24:57,714 --> 03:25:01,063
MARISHA: Wait wait wait. Can I catch it as an air
elemental and bring it back up?

3677
03:25:01,063 --> 03:25:09,802
MATT: You are under the ship currently, you see
the wyvern (whoosh) below. You dive for it. Go

3678
03:25:10,022 --> 03:25:12,165
ahead and make an athletics check.

3679
03:25:12,165 --> 03:25:16,130
TALIESIN: Oh look, everyone, we still have one to
interrogate. Isn't that nice?

3680
03:25:16,199 --> 03:25:17,291
MARISHA: 12.

3681
03:25:17,291 --> 03:25:21,442
MATT: You try to grab it, but your air form
doesn't have quite, and it just swoops through--

3682
03:25:21,442 --> 03:25:23,078
MARISHA: Oh, I'm an air elemental, shit shit
shit.

3683
03:25:23,078 --> 03:25:24,515
MATT: -- and disappears towards the ocean below.

3684
03:25:24,515 --> 03:25:25,775
MARISHA: Forgot.

3685
03:25:25,775 --> 03:25:34,515
MATT: As the captain gets up, the other halfling,
which you can see is dressed in ragged robes, and

3686
03:25:34,515 --> 03:25:35,938
has cloth wrapped across its face.

3687
03:25:35,938 --> 03:25:38,093
LAURA: I pull the arrow so it wraps up in the
rope.

3688
03:25:38,093 --> 03:25:45,404
MATT: The guards are there with
their weapons drawn. You can-- currently there is

3689
03:25:45,404 --> 03:25:48,952
still the spear that's jammed in the side that's
sparking, causing the whole ship to list.

3690
03:25:48,952 --> 03:25:52,144
MARISHA: Can I try and get that out?

3691
03:25:52,144 --> 03:25:58,118
MATT: Yeah, as you swing up you go ahead and
manage to, as your air elemental form, pull the

3692
03:25:58,171 --> 03:26:03,073
strange thing off the edge of the ship, at which
point the blue stone comes back online

3693
03:26:03,073 --> 03:26:04,228
and the ship rights itself.

3694
03:26:04,228 --> 03:26:07,121
LAURA: I thought it was cracked or something.

3695
03:26:07,121 --> 03:26:11,010
MATT: Now you know.

3696
03:26:11,010 --> 03:26:13,968
LAURA: We need to check on that box. Now.

3697
03:26:13,968 --> 03:26:17,194
SAM: Oh yeah, that other wyvern was gone for a
while.

3698
03:26:17,424 --> 03:26:18,641
TALIESIN: I'll go check, you interrogate.

3699
03:26:18,641 --> 03:26:21,450
TRAVIS: We haven't seen any of them come out of
that room.

3700
03:26:21,450 --> 03:26:22,588
MATT: All right. So.

3701
03:26:22,588 --> 03:26:24,004
TALIESIN: If they were clever, they didn't leave
the room.

3702
03:26:24,004 --> 03:26:27,051
ASHLEY: If these are, like he said, a
distraction...

3703
03:26:27,051 --> 03:26:28,662
TALIESIN: I'm going to run down and check the
box.

3704
03:26:28,662 --> 03:26:33,823
MATT: This halfling is currently on the side right
now, the one guard holding it. Who's going

3705
03:26:33,823 --> 03:26:34,713
downstairs?

3706
03:26:34,713 --> 03:26:35,771
TALIESIN: I'm going downstairs.

3707
03:26:35,771 --> 03:26:37,012
TRAVIS: And I'll go to the halfling.

3708
03:26:37,012 --> 03:26:38,995
ASHLEY: Liam, where are you at?

3709
03:26:38,995 --> 03:26:41,501
LAURA: He's in New Jersey.

3710
03:26:41,501 --> 03:26:45,194
LIAM: Last time I spoke, I was by Keyleth. I'm
just following her lead.

3711
03:26:45,194 --> 03:26:46,520
ASHLEY: Are you okay health-wise?

3712
03:26:46,520 --> 03:26:51,845
LIAM: I'm all right. Been better, I've been
worse.

3713
03:26:51,845 --> 03:26:53,769
MATT: So you went over to the halfling. What do
you want to do?

3714
03:26:53,769 --> 03:26:57,821
TRAVIS: I would like to pick him up, not chuck
him, but pick him up and hold him ever-so-gently

3715
03:26:57,821 --> 03:27:03,833
over the side and say, My, my, it does seem like a
long way down. What the fuck are you doing

3716
03:27:03,833 --> 03:27:05,381
attacking this ship?

3717
03:27:05,381 --> 03:27:07,460
ORION: As he says that, I hover the daggers.

3718
03:27:07,460 --> 03:27:12,640
MATT: All right. Roll an intimidation check with
advantage because of Tiberius's--

3719
03:27:12,640 --> 03:27:15,124
SAM: Don't worry, if you fail I can intimidate
him.

3720
03:27:15,124 --> 03:27:17,414
LAURA: Do you have a beard today? He definitely
has a beard today.

3721
03:27:17,414 --> 03:27:18,558
TRAVIS: 16.

3722
03:27:18,558 --> 03:27:19,829
MATT: On both rolls?

3723
03:27:19,829 --> 03:27:21,216
TRAVIS: 16 on the advantage roll.

3724
03:27:21,216 --> 03:27:28,932
MATT: Oh, got you, okay. All right, so the
halfling, which you now look, appears to be

3725
03:27:28,932 --> 03:27:36,078
female. The cloth drops from its face. You can see
the teeth are broken and rotted. This is not a

3726
03:27:36,078 --> 03:27:47,392
city-going folk. "Please, please don't, just let
me live. Let me live."

3727
03:27:47,445 --> 03:27:48,663
TRAVIS: Let you live? Oh!

3728
03:27:48,663 --> 03:27:51,045
MATT: "Guh! Stop it, stop it!"

3729
03:27:51,045 --> 03:27:52,384
TRAVIS: It was such a hard battle, I'm shaking.

3730
03:27:52,384 --> 03:27:53,938
MATT: Starts crying in your grasp.

3731
03:27:53,938 --> 03:27:59,712
ORION: If you wish to live, answer our giant
friend who asked you a rather polite question.

3732
03:27:59,712 --> 03:28:02,467
MATT: "What was the question again?"

3733
03:28:02,467 --> 03:28:07,221
TRAVIS: You know, my hands are so sweaty, I'm
afraid you'll slip if you don't tell me what you

3734
03:28:07,221 --> 03:28:09,825
were doing attacking this ship.

3735
03:28:09,825 --> 03:28:21,975
MATT: "We live in an island below. We usually just
hit ships that come through this channel, this

3736
03:28:21,975 --> 03:28:27,648
"pass. Pirating, if you will. Take money, things
that we can, and run. Usually it's just quick hits

3737
03:28:27,648 --> 03:28:34,193
"and go. We couldn't pass up the opportunity. We
managed to acquire a few things to help, and we've

3738
03:28:34,193 --> 03:28:39,629
"only harried one other skyship. Once we saw you,
we knew there had to be some sort of riches

3739
03:28:39,629 --> 03:28:41,590
"involved."

3740
03:28:41,663 --> 03:28:47,800
LAURA: Insight check?

3741
03:28:48,020 --> 03:28:51,529
LIAM: 16.

3742
03:28:51,700 --> 03:28:53,343
LAURA: 20.

3743
03:28:53,343 --> 03:28:59,613
MATT: Extremely scared, extremely honest, in a
mode of trying to stay alive at this point in time.

3744
03:28:59,613 --> 03:29:01,476
ASHLEY: So nobody hired you?

3745
03:29:01,476 --> 03:29:08,237
MATT: "No, no, haven't been to a city in years. I
told you, we have an island below, it's a cavern

3746
03:29:08,237 --> 03:29:13,669
"we live in. We just come up and out to grab what
we can to survive."

3747
03:29:13,669 --> 03:29:18,162
LAURA: Captain Damon, what do you propose we do
with this thief-pirate?

3748
03:29:18,212 --> 03:29:21,175
MATT: Captain Damon, who's gone back to the ship
to try and get it back on course, is currently

3749
03:29:21,175 --> 03:29:27,646
turning it around. "To be perfectly honest, I
usually throw them overboard. But if you see--"

3750
03:29:27,646 --> 03:29:28,722
TRAVIS: Drop!

3751
03:29:28,722 --> 03:29:30,728
MATT: (screams)

3752
03:29:30,728 --> 03:29:34,446
TRAVIS: If you want him, you can catch him. Her.

3753
03:29:34,446 --> 03:29:35,625
LAURA: Grog!

3754
03:29:35,625 --> 03:29:37,637
TRAVIS: What? The captain said he'd throw him
over.

3755
03:29:37,637 --> 03:29:38,933
SAM: Her.

3756
03:29:38,933 --> 03:29:40,321
TRAVIS: Her over.

3757
03:29:40,321 --> 03:29:42,875
LAURA: It was a girl, it was a poor little girl
halfling.

3758
03:29:42,875 --> 03:29:44,473
Oh wait, I still have the grapple arrow.

3759
03:29:44,524 --> 03:29:46,339
MATT: You do. As the rope's going (unraveling
rope)--

3760
03:29:46,339 --> 03:29:49,498
LAURA: No, I'm still holding on still, so she's
dangling? Can I catch her?

3761
03:29:49,498 --> 03:29:51,856
MATT: Currently, yes. As you look over-- actually,
let me--

3762
03:29:51,856 --> 03:29:53,883
SAM: Does she have an arrow through her arm?

3763
03:29:53,883 --> 03:29:54,736
LAURA: Yeah.

3764
03:29:54,736 --> 03:30:00,770
MATT: Yes. In a very painful way she is currently
held by her shoulder blade, which now has--

3765
03:30:00,770 --> 03:30:03,856
LAURA: But it was wrapped around her, so maybe it
didn't hurt quite as bad.

3766
03:30:03,856 --> 03:30:05,743
MATT: It hurt pretty bad.

3767
03:30:05,743 --> 03:30:10,435
LAURA: I pull her up. I look at Grog. Really?

3768
03:30:10,435 --> 03:30:11,947
TRAVIS: What he's thinking, I'm doing.

3769
03:30:11,947 --> 03:30:14,160
LAURA: Really? I pull her up.

3770
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:16,778
MATT: You pull her up. She's bleeding out and is
looking pretty rough.

3771
03:30:16,778 --> 03:30:18,587
LAURA: Oh shit, maybe we should've let her drop.

3772
03:30:18,587 --> 03:30:22,223
TRAVIS: Oh, really? I pick her up--

3773
03:30:22,223 --> 03:30:23,516
LAURA: No, no. No.

3774
03:30:23,516 --> 03:30:24,689
TRAVIS: Put her back down.

3775
03:30:24,689 --> 03:30:26,626
LAURA: What, should we put her in a prison cell? I
don't know what to do with her now that we have her.

3776
03:30:26,626 --> 03:30:29,961
LIAM: Heal her and put her to work. She's probably
been out of work.

3777
03:30:29,961 --> 03:30:32,457
LAURA: What do you think, little one? You want a
real job, maybe brush your teeth?

3778
03:30:32,457 --> 03:30:34,582
SAM: She can replace the guard that they killed.

3779
03:30:34,582 --> 03:30:38,515
MATT: She's on one knee, going, "Anything."

3780
03:30:38,515 --> 03:30:39,584
LAURA: Anything.

3781
03:30:39,584 --> 03:30:43,781
MATT: "Anything. Just don't drop me." Looking over
at Grog again. "Don't drop me."

3782
03:30:43,781 --> 03:30:45,052
LAURA: Be afraid of him.

3783
03:30:45,052 --> 03:30:46,171
MATT: "Don't drop me."

3784
03:30:46,171 --> 03:30:49,915
LAURA: Be very afraid. Pike, do you want to heal
her?

3785
03:30:49,915 --> 03:30:51,722
ASHLEY: Well. Come here.

3786
03:30:51,722 --> 03:30:55,015
ORION: Are we in agreement, we are saving this
one?

3787
03:30:55,015 --> 03:30:56,507
MARISHA: I guess so.

3788
03:30:56,507 --> 03:31:00,655
SAM: I'm going to go through her pockets, make
sure she's not hiding any weapons to attack us.

3789
03:31:00,655 --> 03:31:04,443
MARISHA: To be fair, we did lose one over the
edge, so we might need another crew member.

3790
03:31:04,443 --> 03:31:05,381
LAURA: That's true.

3791
03:31:05,381 --> 03:31:07,620
ASHLEY: Well, what's your name?

3792
03:31:07,620 --> 03:31:08,728
MATT: "Teera."

3793
03:31:08,728 --> 03:31:09,794
LAURA: Teera.

3794
03:31:09,794 --> 03:31:12,353
ASHLEY: Teera. How old are you?

3795
03:31:12,424 --> 03:31:13,672
MATT: "I don't know."

3796
03:31:13,672 --> 03:31:15,386
LAURA AND SAM: Oh, that's so sad.

3797
03:31:15,386 --> 03:31:20,462
MATT: She looks in her maybe twenties or thirties?
Up close you can see, just a harsh life in the

3798
03:31:20,644 --> 03:31:24,561
harsh elements. She looks older than she is, but
there's a youthfulness to her.

3799
03:31:24,561 --> 03:31:28,965
LAURA: Her breath is really really bad, maybe you
can heal her teeth while you're at it.

3800
03:31:28,965 --> 03:31:33,835
SAM: Teera, empty your pockets. I give her a quick
pat-down to make sure she's not carrying any

3801
03:31:33,835 --> 03:31:35,516
daggers or anything.

3802
03:31:35,516 --> 03:31:41,162
MATT: There are a few rusty hidden blades and a
coin purse that contains four gold.

3803
03:31:41,162 --> 03:31:42,324
SAM: Sweet.

3804
03:31:42,324 --> 03:31:44,816
ASHLEY: Four gold.

3805
03:31:44,816 --> 03:31:46,157
SAM: I take it.

3806
03:31:46,157 --> 03:31:47,037
MATT: All right.

3807
03:31:47,037 --> 03:31:48,835
LAURA: You can earn your wage on this ship, if you
behave.

3808
03:31:48,835 --> 03:31:52,240
MATT: "All right. All right."

3809
03:31:52,240 --> 03:31:59,280
TRAVIS: If you don't. (falling sound)

3810
03:31:59,280 --> 03:32:02,234
SAM: He means he'll throw you overboard.

3811
03:32:02,234 --> 03:32:06,097
LIAM: You can have a real life here, little one.

3812
03:32:06,097 --> 03:32:07,343
LAURA: Yeah.

3813
03:32:07,343 --> 03:32:09,282
LIAM: That's your past. This is your future.

3814
03:32:09,282 --> 03:32:13,843
MATT: And she slinks over towards the doorways
that lead into the lower part of the deck. As you

3815
03:32:13,843 --> 03:32:23,136
guys lead Teera in, the captain has regained
control of the ship, and you guys head in to check

3816
03:32:23,136 --> 03:32:25,653
in on the room where the--

3817
03:32:25,653 --> 03:32:29,358
TALIESIN: I'm knocking on the door. "All right?
Desona?"

3818
03:32:29,358 --> 03:32:31,307
LAURA: Lady Kima?

3819
03:32:31,307 --> 03:32:33,064
TALIESIN: Lady Kima? Hello?

3820
03:32:33,064 --> 03:32:37,258
MATT: The door opens and they're still sitting in
the back by the box with their weapons at the

3821
03:32:37,258 --> 03:32:39,824
ready and Kima looks at the door. "Is everything
all right?"

3822
03:32:39,824 --> 03:32:41,644
TALIESIN: Yes, pirates. We've taken care of it.

3823
03:32:41,644 --> 03:32:46,017
MATT: "Good." And she's rubbing her head. You can
see there's a little trickle of blood on her head,

3824
03:32:46,017 --> 03:32:50,195
apparently when the ship listed, they all slipped
in the room as well.

3825
03:32:50,195 --> 03:32:51,607
TRAVIS: Is she hurt?

3826
03:32:51,607 --> 03:32:53,414
TALIESIN: Do you need anything, is everything all
right?

3827
03:32:53,414 --> 03:32:56,278
MATT: "Ah, it's fine." She reaches up and touches
her head, you can see there's a slight warm glow

3828
03:32:56,278 --> 03:32:59,072
of divine energy and the blood flow stops.

3829
03:32:59,072 --> 03:33:05,552
TALIESIN: Almost feels like cheating. Okay. As
long as everything is fine, there was no

3830
03:33:05,552 --> 03:33:07,489
incidents, nothing unusual?

3831
03:33:07,489 --> 03:33:09,363
MATT: "Nothing, nothing, I've kept a very close
watch."

3832
03:33:09,363 --> 03:33:12,010
TALIESIN: Excellent. I'll report upstairs, then.

3833
03:33:12,010 --> 03:33:13,032
MATT: "Very well."

3834
03:33:13,032 --> 03:33:14,405
TALIESIN: Carry on.

3835
03:33:14,405 --> 03:33:17,661
ASHLEY: Really, the box is fine? For sure?

3836
03:33:17,661 --> 03:33:21,160
TALIESIN: Everybody seemed fine, they said no
events, nothing--

3837
03:33:21,160 --> 03:33:24,347
LAURA: This fricking gnat in this fricking room.

3838
03:33:24,347 --> 03:33:26,956
MARISHA: I know, it was trolling over here.

3839
03:33:26,956 --> 03:33:30,124
ASHLEY: Should we do insight? I don't know.

3840
03:33:30,124 --> 03:33:31,993
TALIESIN: Guards in a room, I mean really.

3841
03:33:31,993 --> 03:33:33,804
ASHLEY: I know, all right, all right.

3842
03:33:33,804 --> 03:33:35,490
TALIESIN: My insight was the box was still there.

3843
03:33:35,490 --> 03:33:39,892
ORION: I cast Prestidigitation on the little
halfling and clean her up real quick.

3844
03:33:39,892 --> 03:33:45,005
MATT: Okay. As she's going
inside, she watches her form--

3845
03:33:45,005 --> 03:33:47,697
LAURA: It feels like little fishes, doesn't it?

3846
03:33:47,697 --> 03:33:51,099
MATT: She sounds tickled and scared at the same
time. But the clothing cleans up. It's still

3847
03:33:51,099 --> 03:33:58,861
tattered, and she looks a little cleaner. Most of
the dirt's gone, but she still looks weathered,

3848
03:33:58,861 --> 03:34:00,819
her skin's darker from a lot of sun.

3849
03:34:00,819 --> 03:34:02,442
ORION: I was mainly working on the smell.

3850
03:34:02,442 --> 03:34:06,807
MATT: Ah. That's taken care of. She looks to you.
"Thanks."

3851
03:34:06,807 --> 03:34:09,056
ORION: A proper bath will be better, but--

3852
03:34:09,056 --> 03:34:10,432
LAURA: Is she healed? Did you heal her?

3853
03:34:10,432 --> 03:34:11,716
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, I did.

3854
03:34:11,716 --> 03:34:13,705
MARISHA: I drop the elemental form.

3855
03:34:13,705 --> 03:34:14,869
MATT: All right.

3856
03:34:14,869 --> 03:34:18,100
MARISHA: No longer a tornado.

3857
03:34:18,100 --> 03:34:24,231
MATT: We'll say as you guys all head back
underneath the ship to go ahead and right

3858
03:34:24,231 --> 03:34:29,549
yourselves for the remainder of the journey, we'll
call the game for the evening there.

3859
03:34:29,549 --> 03:34:30,906
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3860
03:34:30,906 --> 03:34:32,109
LAURA: Wow.

3861
03:34:32,109 --> 03:34:34,944
TALIESIN: Welcome back, everybody.

3862
03:34:34,944 --> 03:34:36,940
TRAVIS: Great map, man.

3863
03:34:36,940 --> 03:34:38,635
LAURA: That's so cool!

3864
03:34:38,635 --> 03:34:39,804
TRAVIS: That shit looks awesome.

3865
03:34:39,804 --> 03:34:41,114
MARISHA: I know, it's so cool!

3866
03:34:41,114 --> 03:34:43,125
MATT: You guys handled that pretty damn well.

3867
03:34:43,125 --> 03:34:44,818
TALIESIN: This is way better than E3.

3868
03:34:44,818 --> 03:34:46,387
LAURA: He's definitely trying to kill us.

3869
03:34:46,387 --> 03:34:49,132
TRAVIS: Only one of us got thrown off the ship,
and she could fly.

3870
03:34:49,132 --> 03:34:51,445
MARISHA: I know! It was nice.

3871
03:34:51,445 --> 03:34:54,982
MATT: Yeah, they had no idea you were a druid. You
were the closest one to the griffons.

3872
03:34:54,982 --> 03:34:56,980
MARISHA: I'm okay, I'm okay.

3873
03:34:56,980 --> 03:35:00,808
TRAVIS: Normally that's me, just right off.

3874
03:35:00,933 --> 03:35:05,388
TALIESIN: We never liked her anyway, whatever.

3875
03:35:05,465 --> 04:09:01,942
