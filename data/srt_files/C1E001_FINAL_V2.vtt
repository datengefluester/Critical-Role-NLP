NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.314 --> 00:00:04.420
MATT: Hello everyone. My name is Matthew Mercer,
voice actor and Dungeon Master for Critical Role

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.768
on Geek & Sundry, where I take a bunch of other
voice actors and run them through a fantastical

00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:13.387
fantasy adventure through the world of Dungeons &
Dragons. We play every Thursday at 7:00pm Pacific

00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:16.685
Standard Time on Geek & Sundry's Twitch stream.
Please come watch us live if you have the

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:21.536
opportunity. Back episodes and future episodes
will be uploaded on the Geek & Sundry website. You

00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:24.239
can also check them out there. In the meantime,
enjoy!

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.412
MATT: Welcome to first episode of Critical Role,
and what this basically is is a continuation of

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:34.390
our weekly D&D game. Me and a bunch of other
likely nerdy and enjoyable voice actors gathering

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.383
around, rolling some dice, killing some creatures,
having some adventure. Now we have the pleasure of

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:43.816
bringing it on the stream for you to watch,
enjoy, and occasionally interact with. Before we

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:47.425
get to that, to give you a little backstory on the
characters you'll be seeing this evening, we're

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:51.606
going to play some videos for you in a second. Do
note for all you hardcore gamers out there, a lot

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:55.340
of this is house-ruled, loosey-goosey having a
good time. So all you number crunchers, stop

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.341
paying attention there, just have fun with it.
Nevertheless, we have some background story on

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:04.580
many of the characters you'll be seeing this
evening to help you jump into the story. Let's go

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:09.809
ahead and enjoy those in a minute, then we'll
introduce the players. So have fun!

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:17.965
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of

00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:25.650
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.671
combat, women, and ale!

00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:30.632
[record scratch]

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:37.613
TRAVIS: Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog
is often consulted for his vast knowledge of

00:01:37.613 --> 00:01:47.412
shapes, colors, and shiny things! Also ale. In his
early years, armed with his two-handed greataxe,

00:01:47.412 --> 00:01:53.441
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the
ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after

00:01:53.493 --> 00:02:00.172
coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the
woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:08.852
life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity
for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:18.171
his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody,
and banished by the herd leader, his Uncle Kevdak,

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:25.805
Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from
his herd, it was then that the relative of the

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:34.121
very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was
the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:41.534
healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.
And they have remained close friends ever since.

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:48.595
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Or accompanying

00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:57.286
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors. Also ale!

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:01.377
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

00:03:01.377 --> 00:03:06.740
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.178
kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise
underestimate her based on first impressions.

00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:14.783
[thunder crack]

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:19.864
MARISHA: Under that un-intimidating petite frame
is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose

00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:27.098
natural powers have made even the fiercest of
champions pee their pants, literally! Born to the

00:03:27.098 --> 00:03:32.809
Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised
with a deep love of nature and the elemental

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:38.815
magics. It is her people's inherent duty to
protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the

00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:44.649
four elemental planes begin to bleed with this
realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:50.577
a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping
abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and

00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:57.957
flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do.
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of

00:03:57.957 --> 00:04:03.838
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to

00:04:03.838 --> 00:04:10.088
succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like
that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:15.105
replaced with endless spell memorization,
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly

00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:20.736
high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in

00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:26.716
order to introduce and establish respect amongst
the fellow headmasters. They call this the

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:33.362
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:40.021
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she
will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain

00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:46.590
towards Stilben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.356
warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and
compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:58.783
thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even
worthy?

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:05.812
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of seven
children, born to a noble family who lived far to

00:05:05.812 --> 00:05:10.992
the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:17.965
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the
sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:23.836
mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood,
came to court. During a feast held in their honor,

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:29.058
the Briarwoods violently took control of the
castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would

00:05:29.058 --> 00:05:35.044
stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.

00:05:35.044 --> 00:05:42.405
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:47.859
the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river and floating

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:54.331
unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the

00:05:54.331 --> 00:06:01.012
next two years, as he slowly made his way as far
south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:07.275
dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:11.705
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first
gun.

00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:20.460
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.115
eye on you. A talented musician, master of
disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:33.805
Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his
own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:39.769
endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for
coin and support his single mother. One day, he

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:46.188
was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined
Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where

00:06:46.188 --> 00:06:52.331
he learned the ways of the world, and honed his
skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of

00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:57.132
his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms
with the violent death of his mother at the hands

00:06:57.132 --> 00:07:03.018
of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say, educational

00:07:03.018 --> 00:07:09.067
experiences with the opposite sex, deep down
Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known:

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:16.954
the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan
considers himself a lover first, performer second,

00:07:16.954 --> 00:07:23.234
and fighter distant third. On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood,

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:29.794
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count
on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song,

00:07:29.794 --> 00:07:35.012
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and
makes the females swoon.

00:07:37.722 --> 00:07:43.670
ORION: Greetings and salutations, I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:49.838
located in the heart of Draconia, born from a
politically respected family. At the age of 15, I

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.054
succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing
prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and

00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:59.532
the Draconian high council were amazed at how
powerful my spells were for how long I had been

00:07:59.532 --> 00:08:04.533
training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian

00:08:04.533 --> 00:08:10.634
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's

00:08:10.634 --> 00:08:17.103
rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a
chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room

00:08:17.103 --> 00:08:22.216
were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding
cities and areas around the known world. For

00:08:22.216 --> 00:08:27.321
months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned
of artifacts from legend. After a long period of

00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:32.047
research, I made a list of artifacts that caught
my eye. I brought these findings to the high

00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:36.686
council and was told that all of the information
in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:42.756
believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever. I found those answers

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:48.545
to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse
and managed to convince the city council to lend

00:08:48.545 --> 00:08:53.433
support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of
peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:58.511
Going from town to town and making friends and
allies in and for the name of Draconia. Being a

00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:04.519
red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands
in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:10.603
so I could explore the world and find these
artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some

00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:16.426
may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock
to all that. I am much sharper than most give me

00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:21.951
credit for. I just don't pay attention to things
sometimes. I've also been known to be rather

00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:29.295
cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:33.745
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

00:09:34.985 --> 00:09:40.125
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:46.777
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door. Along with twin sister

00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:53.857
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter
between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised

00:09:53.857 --> 00:09:58.301
by their mother in their early years, the twins
were eventually sent off to their father in the

00:09:58.301 --> 00:10:04.458
elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception
among the elves there never warmed, and their time

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:09.967
in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole
away one autumn night and set out on the open

00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:16.326
road. After a few years of wandering, they
eventually decided to return to their mother, and

00:10:16.326 --> 00:10:22.064
journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But
instead of finding their childhood home, they

00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:28.284
returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was
gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the

00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:37.606
townspeople for answers, they learned of the day
the dragon came. With their ties all severed,

00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:44.522
Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their
fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since

00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:51.189
birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's
challenges in his own particular way, often by

00:10:51.189 --> 00:10:59.207
sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for
circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of

00:10:59.207 --> 00:11:03.208
blades the elves schooled him in more than makes
up the difference.

00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:09.135
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:16.576
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother, and an elven father who

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:21.623
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother,

00:11:21.623 --> 00:11:29.056
Vax'ildan, quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world were each other.

00:11:29.056 --> 00:11:34.690
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:41.626
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

00:11:41.626 --> 00:11:48.116
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:56.341
indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax
took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

00:11:56.341 --> 00:12:04.153
learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to
the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the

00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:11.999
keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,
to spy and to shoot. Through a series of fateful

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:19.135
events, earned herself a companion in the form of
a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight

00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:28.761
alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he
is adorable, and gives expert massages. Like so

00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:29.688
many half-elves--

00:12:30.738 --> 00:12:34.886
MATT: Hey guys, welcome back. To give you a little
heads up, we are playing the 5th edition of

00:12:35.104 --> 00:12:38.914
Dungeons & Dragons. We recently converted over
from Pathfinder, for those who play Pathfinder.

00:12:38.914 --> 00:12:43.211
One of our players was a gunslinger, for which
there are no rules for in 5th edition. So I had to

00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:47.432
create and customize those for the game, so bear
with us on that. That will be an interesting ride,

00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:51.119
regardless. We do have an eight-player game we've
been playing for two years, which is a little

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:55.170
crazy, which is why we go a little loose with the
rules. It's a great group, it's a lot of fun. Not

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.319
everyone can make every game, so we have enough
players to definitely pull a party each time.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:03.155
ZAC: Just so you know, we're having an audio
bottleneck. It'll take about 30 seconds to work

00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:04.078
itself out.

00:13:04.078 --> 00:13:05.078
MATT: Okay, audio bottleneck.

00:13:05.078 --> 00:13:07.234
ZAC: Tech problems that make me want to murder
someone.

00:13:07.234 --> 00:13:13.292
MATT: That's okay. Just a second. You let us know
when it's okay to talk.

00:13:20.082 --> 00:13:22.934
TRAVIS: I don't know what that means, a
bottleneck.

00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:35.094
MATT: Are we all right? And how are we?
Exterminate. Exterminate.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:42.884
SAM: Nice. Audio isn't working they're going to
watch something else. Thanks, douche.

00:13:42.884 --> 00:13:45.870
(laughter)

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.163
MATT: Is the mic adjusted? Is it any better?

00:13:47.163 --> 00:13:49.226
ZAC: Better now. We're good.

00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:54.335
MATT: Well, great. Thank you guys. A couple of
things transitioned from Pathfinder to 5th edition

00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:58.357
may be a little strange and fun. We have a lot of
players, but they're great folks and most of that

00:13:58.357 --> 00:14:02.351
just means I have to work really hard to make sure
the game keeps going, so that's on me. Ashley

00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:07.177
Johnson, unfortunately, cannot join us. She's our
gnome cleric, Pike. She'll be here next week.

00:14:07.177 --> 00:14:12.967
Unfortunately, she's in London accepting a BAFTA,
so I think we're okay. For the Last of Us. That's

00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:18.817
harsh. Also no donations this week, but going
forward we will have donations available for those

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:23.689
that will help partially run the show from our
wonderful cameraman and crew. Also, half of our

00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:28.162
donations will go to the 826 charity. Marisha, if
you want to talk a little about that.

00:14:28.162 --> 00:14:35.646
MARISHA: Yes! 826LA is a charity that focuses on
tutoring children in an after-school program and

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:42.637
helping specifically with creativity,
storytelling, art and general things that relate

00:14:42.637 --> 00:14:48.189
to Dungeons & Dragons. You should definitely check
out the Time Travel Mart. There is one in Echo

00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:53.486
Park and one in Mar Vista. They have this amazing
storefront where you can buy these awesome

00:14:53.486 --> 00:15:00.893
tchotchkes and things that go immediately to
support the charity and the stream. It's awesome.

00:15:00.893 --> 00:15:03.816
It's 826LA, you should look it up. There's a few
all over the country.

00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:09.427
MATT: Yes. Also, as a heads up because I saw some
of you guys ask me in the chatroom: These videos

00:15:09.427 --> 00:15:12.982
will be available on the Geek & Sundry YouTube
Channel soon enough, as well as a more extensive

00:15:12.982 --> 00:15:16.176
backstory of the party. We'll have all that
content ready for you so you don't have to

00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:21.069
memorize it. Maybe a bio page, I don't know. We'll
figure something out. It'll be fine. Anyway, let's

00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:24.117
open that up. You know who I am. Matthew Mercer,
voice actor and I've been running this game for

00:15:24.117 --> 00:15:28.316
two years. I'm a hardcore nerd. Let's go around
the table and introduce our players so you can

00:15:28.316 --> 00:15:33.843
attach the faces to the intros you just saw. Let's
start on this side with Travis.

00:15:33.843 --> 00:15:41.842
TRAVIS: Oh! Hi. I'm Travis Willingham, voice
actor, gamer. I play Grog the goliath barbarian.

00:15:48.472 --> 00:15:54.940
LAURA: Hi. I'm Laura Bailey. I'm also, you know, a
voice actor like everyone here.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.404
TRAVIS: Yeah. I think we all are.

00:15:56.792 --> 00:15:59.848
LAURA: I'm playing Vex'ahlia. The coolest chick
ever.

00:15:59.848 --> 00:16:02.693
MATT: The ranger with the bear.

00:16:02.693 --> 00:16:06.078
LAURA: The ranger with the bear named Trinket, in
case you didn't catch that. His name is Trinket

00:16:06.078 --> 00:16:06.883
and he's amazing.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:17.289
LIAM: Hi, I'm Liam O'Brien. I'm playing Vax'ildan.
This one's twin. We're half-elven twins. I started

00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:23.565
playing D&D when I was 13 and I can't believe this
is happening. So cheers. Cheers to this.

00:16:27.565 --> 00:16:35.238
TALIESIN: My name is Taliesin Jaffe. I'm a voice
actor, director, and I've been playing some form

00:16:35.546 --> 00:16:39.250
of Dungeons & Dragons, and if you can't tell by my
black clothing, a lot of Vampire the Masquerade

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.072
when I was a teenager.

00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:46.724
There was a problem. I'm playing Percy, the
Gunslinger. I'm the reason all the rules are all

00:16:46.724 --> 00:16:47.328
messed up.

00:16:50.598 --> 00:16:59.199
MARISHA: I am Keyleth, the druid from the tribe of
the Air Ashari. I am a half-elven person.

00:16:59.401 --> 00:17:00.125
MATT: No, you're elven.

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:00.766
MARISHA: No, half-elf.

00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:01.521
MATT: Half-elf. Okay.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:08.984
MARISHA: Yeah, Come on, man. I've been half-elf
since day one. Half-elven. Yes! You can see me

00:17:08.984 --> 00:17:11.221
shooting lightning and turning into awesome
animals.

00:17:14.341 --> 00:17:15.349
MATT: Orion.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:16.431
ORION and MATT: Hi.

00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:24.227
ORION: Hey, everybody. I'm Orion Acaba and I'm
also a voice actor. I do things.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:25.708
MARISHA: Oh, I'm Marisha Ray, by the way.

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:26.625
ORION: Yeah!

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:27.644
MARISHA: Did I say that?

00:17:27.644 --> 00:17:28.930
ORION: Keyleth is Marisha Ray.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.548
MATT: Let Orion have his moment. Don't try and
break--

00:17:30.548 --> 00:17:32.443
ORION: No, it's our moment.

00:17:32.443 --> 00:17:33.555
MATT: There you go. All right.

00:17:33.555 --> 00:17:35.429
ORION: I'm Tiberius the awesome sorcerer.

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:36.968
MATT: Dragonborn sorcerer.

00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:38.566
ORION: Dragonborn, yeah! That's right.

00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:46.541
SAM: I'm Sam Riegel: a voice actor, and stuff. My
character is Scanlan Shorthalt. The gnome bard who

00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:48.868
sings a lot. Let's start playing, yeah?

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:50.647
(cheering)

00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:56.211
MATT: All right! Let's jump on in. Thank you. Last
we left off, to give you a little backstory. The

00:17:56.211 --> 00:18:01.477
party had completed a large venture in saving the
nearby city of Emon. One of the central capitals

00:18:01.477 --> 00:18:07.853
of this human civilization of Tal'Dorei. They
managed to halt a demonic insurrection within the

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:14.566
throne and as such were greeted to a hero's
celebration and had a keep built in their honor.

00:18:14.566 --> 00:18:18.822
Over the six month period of the keep being
constructed, they went their own ways and then

00:18:18.822 --> 00:18:23.741
returned to see its final creation. However, they
did not have a chance to really enjoy it

00:18:23.741 --> 00:18:29.377
immediately as one of their good friends and
allies, Arcanist Allura Vysoren of the Tal'Dorei

00:18:29.377 --> 00:18:33.927
council came to them requesting their aid saying
that a long time friend of hers, Lady Kima of

00:18:33.927 --> 00:18:38.724
Vord, who is a very well known and very well
respected halfling paladin of Bahamut, the

00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:43.384
Platinum Dragon, had been gone on a pilgrimage for
a while, essentially a vision quest that is part

00:18:43.384 --> 00:18:51.126
of her own development as a paladin. As part of
this, she let the information go to Allura that a

00:18:51.126 --> 00:18:55.839
dark vision had come to her saying that some sort
of evil root is beginning to breed beneath

00:18:55.839 --> 00:19:01.397
Kraghammer and the mountains within Kraghammer,
which is the nearby dwarven civilization that you

00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:05.346
guys have previously not been allowed entry to
because the dwarves weren't fans of nobody without

00:19:05.346 --> 00:19:10.939
any political means of entry. However, she managed
to acquire the necessary documentation and offered

00:19:10.939 --> 00:19:16.027
you a very substantial reward should you find the
whereabouts of Lady Kima of Vord and hopefully

00:19:16.027 --> 00:19:23.190
bring her back safely. You left on the pathway to
the dwarven citadel of Kraghammer. You were

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:31.473
ambushed by a group of roaming barbarian goliaths.
Part way through the battle, Grog managed to

00:19:31.473 --> 00:19:37.153
recognize one of them as a previous ally and no
longer an ally at this time.

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:38.195
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

00:19:38.195 --> 00:19:41.991
MATT: Yep, the barbarian for his first and only
time so far managed to avert battle through a

00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:47.794
social encounter and rolled pretty damn well on a
persuasion check. So you got one. You get one. You

00:19:47.794 --> 00:19:49.126
got your one. Never again.

00:19:49.126 --> 00:19:50.184
TRAVIS: Next time he dies.

00:19:50.184 --> 00:19:56.658
MATT: Yeah. Essentially. Which managed to not turn
it into complete bloodshed. You continued on your

00:19:56.658 --> 00:20:01.030
way to Kraghammer, presented your paperwork, were
given entry into the city and that is where we

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.212
begin this adventure.

00:20:02.212 --> 00:20:02.864
LAURA: Oh no.

00:20:02.864 --> 00:20:03.821
SAM: In the city of Kraghammer?

00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:04.774
MATT: In the city of Kraghammer.

00:20:04.774 --> 00:20:05.931
SAM: Wow! This is fantastic.

00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:07.130
TRAVIS: We're in, right?

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.220
MARISHA: Yes. We were at the door. We were talking
to someone right?

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.117
MATT: Yeah, you were talking to the front guards
at the gate of Kraghammer. They have begrudgingly

00:20:13.117 --> 00:20:17.377
let you inside. Giving you a couple of pointers
little prods and sent you into the city proper.

00:20:17.377 --> 00:20:22.577
You made your way through the darkened alleyways
and stone carved tunnel that leads into the main,

00:20:22.577 --> 00:20:28.009
central portion of the city proper. An enormous
underground metropolis sprawls out before you. The

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:33.709
dark earth and shadows creating beautiful stone
work, marble columns, archways, and labyrinthine

00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:38.945
bridges climbing across the vertical cityscape.
All warmed with the red glow of some strange,

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:43.234
crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a
light source. A large metal forge envelops the

00:20:43.234 --> 00:20:50.211
center of this cylindrical city. The entire is a
three-tiered cylindrical city that is built into

00:20:50.211 --> 00:20:54.392
the ground of the mountain itself. Welcome to
Kraghammer!

00:20:54.392 --> 00:20:58.157
LIAM: Remind us. Did we bullshit our way in here,
or did--

00:20:58.157 --> 00:20:59.506
LAURA: No, we had a way in.

00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:03.018
MATT: No, Allura got your paperwork so you were
actually able to get in this time.

00:21:03.018 --> 00:21:05.329
LAURA: But, Ashley speaks Dwarvish. Pike speaks--

00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:08.590
MATT: Pike speaks Dwarvish and she's not here.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.225
ORION: I speak Dwarvish as well!

00:21:10.225 --> 00:21:10.821
LAURA: Oh good!

00:21:10.821 --> 00:21:11.387
ORION: I do.

00:21:11.387 --> 00:21:12.526
SAM: That's fantastic.

00:21:12.526 --> 00:21:18.851
MATT: The only other bit of information you have
about the whereabouts of her is that she came here

00:21:19.138 --> 00:21:25.305
to go into the mine Apparently, a mithral mine
where this evil is supposedly brewing. You heard

00:21:25.305 --> 00:21:33.460
that the one person who owns the biggest part of
the mithral market here cornering, his name was the

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.978
dwarven Lord Nostoc Greyspine. That was the only
name you had in regards to this deep earth quarry.

00:21:38.978 --> 00:21:40.829
SAM: Greyspine?

00:21:40.829 --> 00:21:41.958
MATT: Greyspine, correct.

00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:46.140
SAM: We have to go find him, don't we?

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.407
TALIESIN: I think before we do anything we should
find a place to sleep.

00:21:49.407 --> 00:21:50.252
ORION: That's true!

00:21:50.252 --> 00:21:52.072
TRAVIS: Oh! We're all jacked up from before,
right?

00:21:52.072 --> 00:21:54.879
TALIESIN: Wouldn't it be nice to put everything
down for a little while.

00:21:54.879 --> 00:21:58.506
SAM: Of course. I've got a lot of <i>booty</i> that I
need to stow.

00:21:58.506 --> 00:22:05.571
ORION: Good way to phrase that, Scanlan. Also, I
would like to check out any places where they

00:22:05.571 --> 00:22:07.173
might have enchanted libraries or what not.

00:22:07.173 --> 00:22:11.589
SAM: Can you stick with us? You're the only one
that speaks Dwarvish.

00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:13.054
LIAM: Yes, you're getting ahead of yourself.

00:22:13.054 --> 00:22:14.840
ORION: I'm just saying put it on the list.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.800
LIAM: Let's look around. Are there any dwarves in
the vicinity?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.617
MATT: Oh, there are many! As you finish this
conversation you look about there are two guards

00:22:25.617 --> 00:22:31.589
posted nearby wearing dark crimson and brass chest
plates that have a uniform scar carved across the

00:22:31.589 --> 00:22:36.753
front. It's actually built into the armor itself
as a design. They're both staring awkwardly at all

00:22:36.753 --> 00:22:40.176
of you arguing in the middle of this entry
thoroughfare of Kraghammer.

00:22:40.176 --> 00:22:42.169
LIAM: Tiberius, make with the dwarf-talk, please.

00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:49.552
ORION: Hello, friends. My associates and I were
looking for a place of lodging for the night and a

00:22:49.552 --> 00:22:51.477
place of reputable reputation.

00:22:51.477 --> 00:22:55.958
MATT: One dwarf shouts over to another one, "You
hear that, Jepson?! They're looking for a place to

00:22:55.958 --> 00:23:02.550
"stay." "Aye, I heard that right. It's about time
we had some new folk in town. Well, if you're

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.230
"looking for a place to stay I'd say your best bet
would be the Pig Pits."

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.992
SAM: Is that the name of a place?

00:23:08.992 --> 00:23:10.886
MATT: "Yes! Certainly! The Pig Pits."

00:23:10.886 --> 00:23:11.521
SAM: All right.

00:23:11.521 --> 00:23:12.753
MATT: "Ask for the Pig Pits--"

00:23:12.753 --> 00:23:14.964
LAURA: Those are actually pig pits, isn't it?

00:23:14.964 --> 00:23:18.154
MARISHA: I feel like we're being hazed.

00:23:18.154 --> 00:23:21.115
MATT: "What?! No! Not at all."

00:23:21.115 --> 00:23:22.320
TRAVIS: That sounds fine with me.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.108
LIAM: This is Common?

00:23:23.108 --> 00:23:24.432
MATT: This is all in Common, yeah.

00:23:24.432 --> 00:23:28.636
SAM: Which way to the Pig Pits, sir?

00:23:28.636 --> 00:23:33.756
MATT: "Pig Pits are that way." He points over the
edge and you see down past the central forge

00:23:33.756 --> 00:23:40.395
structure in the city to the very bottom nearby a
large temple that envelops the bottom floor of

00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:47.458
Kraghammer proper there is indeed a distant slop
of mud where internal livestock are being kept.

00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:55.709
LAURA: I bring out a piece of gold. Please, sir,
we're looking for a place to stay that isn't

00:23:55.709 --> 00:23:56.787
covered in mud.

00:23:56.787 --> 00:24:03.845
MATT: "It's good to see that at least one of you
speaks Dwarvish." Takes the coin, kinks it in his

00:24:04.273 --> 00:24:07.056
teeth and goes, "All right, now if you're looking
for a proper place to stay you're going to look

00:24:07.056 --> 00:24:12.320
"for the Iron Hearth Tavern. That is to your left
up that way no more than a half mile. Keep an eye

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.747
"out. Listen for the laughter and the people who
are very drunk. That's your best bet."

00:24:15.747 --> 00:24:16.575
LAURA: Thank you, sir.

00:24:16.575 --> 00:24:17.346
MATT: "No worries."

00:24:17.346 --> 00:24:18.561
LAURA: I like your armor by the way.

00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:20.017
MATT: "Well, thank you kindly."

00:24:20.017 --> 00:24:21.072
TRAVIS: Was that a wink?

00:24:21.072 --> 00:24:21.653
LAURA: It was.

00:24:24.113 --> 00:24:25.472
LIAM: That's all she does.

00:24:25.472 --> 00:24:27.398
LAURA: That's all I do is wink at people.

00:24:27.398 --> 00:24:28.767
LIAM: It's a nervous tic, really.

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:35.471
MATT: It's a feat she took. You progress to the
western side of the Kraghammer rotation as you

00:24:35.826 --> 00:24:41.536
curl around the central platform. Making your way
eventually to the outside of this rather large,

00:24:41.536 --> 00:24:47.631
central tavern inn. As you walk in, you can hear
music playing, you can hear laughter and boastful

00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:51.476
cheer, you can hear some arguments in the
distance. You can hear it from a good two or three

00:24:51.476 --> 00:24:56.772
buildings away. This is definitely a central
social environment here in Kraghammer. As you walk

00:24:56.772 --> 00:25:00.274
inside, you-- Let me get some proper tavern music
here for you.

00:25:00.274 --> 00:25:02.179
SAM: Smells in here.

00:25:02.179 --> 00:25:03.939
TRAVIS: Drinking territory.

00:25:03.939 --> 00:25:10.250
MATT: You hear some loud boisterous (hearty
dwarven laughter), some drinks being clinked

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.370
together. As you walk in, the first thing that
catches you is the scent of stale alcohol and

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.962
smoked wood of some kind.

00:25:15.962 --> 00:25:16.675
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:25:16.675 --> 00:25:23.978
MATT: There are tables, most of them in decent
condition, some of them half-broken and repaired,

00:25:23.978 --> 00:25:30.150
probably from some previous encounter in the bar.
In the center of the room, there looks to be a not

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:38.759
currently in use, specifically built brawling
circle. It's about 30 feet by 20 feet. It's more

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:41.323
of an oval. It's not in use, currently.

00:25:41.323 --> 00:25:42.368
SAM: An octagon?

00:25:42.368 --> 00:25:43.070
MATT: Essentially.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.265
LIAM: How high is the ceiling here? Can Grog fit
in here?

00:25:46.265 --> 00:25:47.738
TRAVIS: Oh right, am I like--?

00:25:47.738 --> 00:25:51.690
MATT: The ceiling actually is considered vaulted
ceiling for dwarves so it runs at about seven

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:57.416
feet. For Grog, it's uncomfortable, almost
scratching your head across the top. As you enter,

00:25:57.416 --> 00:26:03.451
about seven or eight of the nearby dwarves at the
front door go, (hearty laughter). They look

00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:07.467
immediately at the ragtag non-dwarven group that
just stumbled into the center of the tavern.

00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:09.382
TRAVIS: What're you looking at?

00:26:10.622 --> 00:26:14.841
MATT: "It's not very often we get someone with
that kind of a mug on you. Let me buy you a drink, come

00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:15.424
"sit down!"

00:26:15.424 --> 00:26:21.584
TRAVIS: My kind of people, see you later! I go
grab the drink with the lovely dwarves.

00:26:21.584 --> 00:26:23.763
LAURA: We grab a table next to the dwarves with
Grog.

00:26:23.763 --> 00:26:27.972
MATT: Both tables next to the table they're at are
completely filled with dwarves.

00:26:27.972 --> 00:26:33.573
LIAM: I take a sack of gold out of my own pocket,
slam it down on the table--

00:26:33.573 --> 00:26:35.513
LAURA: A sack of gold, are you crazy?!

00:26:35.513 --> 00:26:42.396
LIAM: Gentlemens and ladies. Ladies and gentlemen,
we are traveling from far away. We just arrived

00:26:42.614 --> 00:26:50.628
from Emon. We are fascinated to see your
underground city and to celebrate the occasion I

00:26:50.628 --> 00:26:55.237
would like to buy every dwarf in here a round.
Bartender!

00:26:55.237 --> 00:27:02.219
MATT: The music stops. The conversation stops. All
dwarven eyes turn to the table and they all turn

00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:06.742
to a single dwarven woman in the back who's behind
one of the bars, who has a towel over one arm.

00:27:06.742 --> 00:27:13.101
She's looking around, she's staring confused at
you and all eyes are on her, and she goes, "Well,

00:27:13.101 --> 00:27:17.265
"it's about time someone around here had some
generosity! Certainly, pay upfront. Drinks all

00:27:17.265 --> 00:27:19.080
"around on this half-elven gentleman."

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.108
LIAM: Let it rain!

00:27:20.108 --> 00:27:22.907
(cheering)

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.349
MARISHA: Make it rain.

00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:25.978
TRAVIS: I would like a cask of ale.

00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:29.096
LIAM: I'll need your largest bowl of ale for this
one here.

00:27:29.096 --> 00:27:31.996
TRAVIS: Cask. Cask of ale. Cask.

00:27:31.996 --> 00:27:36.276
MATT: "No worries, Adra's got your back, be right
back." She wanders off to the back room, comes

00:27:36.276 --> 00:27:41.860
back and starts pouring stein after stein after
stein of ale.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.062
TRAVIS: Yeah. Keep going. Looks good.

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:49.103
MATT: You do notice she is definitely the head of
this tavern and all of her barkeeps are male and

00:27:49.103 --> 00:27:52.453
seem to be worked rather ragged.

00:27:52.453 --> 00:27:53.782
LAURA: What was her name?

00:27:53.782 --> 00:27:56.405
SAM: Excuse me, miss. You.

00:27:56.405 --> 00:27:57.476
MATT: "Adra. Yeah?"

00:27:57.476 --> 00:27:58.417
SAM: I'm sorry?

00:27:58.417 --> 00:27:59.339
MATT: "Adra."

00:27:59.339 --> 00:28:02.410
SAM: Adra! You run a fantastic establishment.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.438
MATT: "That's right I do!"

00:28:03.438 --> 00:28:07.107
SAM: Thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to
buy this round.

00:28:07.107 --> 00:28:10.791
MATT: "Of course. Patrons that come and drop coin
like that are welcome any time."

00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:16.528
SAM: Well, thank you for your hospitality. Might
we inquire about staying here the night? Do you

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:18.405
have an inn with the establishment?

00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:22.165
MATT: She reaches below and pulls out a big tome
and starts thumbing through it. "You know,

00:28:22.165 --> 00:28:24.170
"actually we have openings right now on the second
floor."

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.525
SAM: Several rooms, or just one?

00:28:26.525 --> 00:28:28.220
MATT: "Do you need them side by side?"

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.576
SAM: That would be nice.

00:28:29.576 --> 00:28:32.180
MATT: "We could pull him there and push him into
room seven."

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.842
SAM: Something with a little bed for me.

00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:42.619
MATT: "Giles!" One of the dwarf barmaiders comes
over. "Aye?" "Get Stepheson out of his room, move

00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:48.647
"him to the third floor. We have to open a block
for our new guests." "Ugh, fine." The older dwarf

00:28:48.647 --> 00:28:54.481
stumbles his way up the stairs begrudgingly.
"Right, so I can get a room for each of you. We're

00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:59.930
"looking at eight rooms separately, that will run
you per evening about 25 gold pieces. Does that

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:00.799
sound about right?"

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:01.484
TRAVIS: Total?

00:29:01.484 --> 00:29:03.589
MATT: "25 total pieces."

00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:04.644
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:07.191
LAURA: You want to share a room?

00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:09.085
MARISHA: Yeah! We'll bunk up.

00:29:09.085 --> 00:29:13.832
SAM: Grog, you and me. I can sleep on your feet.

00:29:13.832 --> 00:29:18.722
LAURA: Probably like 15 gold then for just that
amount.

00:29:18.722 --> 00:29:22.985
MATT: She visibly deflates a little bit and is
like, "All right, fair enough. Five rooms it is.

00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:25.534
15 gold per room."

00:29:25.534 --> 00:29:26.842
SAM: We're penny pinchers.

00:29:26.842 --> 00:29:29.473
MATT: "How long do you expect to stay?"

00:29:29.473 --> 00:29:30.926
ORION: At least a few days.

00:29:30.926 --> 00:29:32.488
SAM: I'd say a week.

00:29:32.488 --> 00:29:36.442
TALIESIN: With an indefinite hold, we have
business in the city.

00:29:36.442 --> 00:29:39.408
MATT: "Right! Well how bout we pay the week in
advance and I'll give you a discount?"

00:29:39.408 --> 00:29:40.917
LAURA: What's the discount?

00:29:43.007 --> 00:29:48.186
MARISHA: Wait. I thought we were going to be
heading south?

00:29:49.249 --> 00:29:53.396
MATT: "Let's say, 100 gold for the week, all five
rooms."

00:29:56.835 --> 00:29:58.620
LIAM: We're pretty flush, I think we can handle
it.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.322
LAURA: Yes. That works.

00:29:59.322 --> 00:30:00.648
TALIESIN: This doesn't terrify me.

00:30:00.648 --> 00:30:02.933
LAURA: I think I did the math wrong.

00:30:02.933 --> 00:30:05.062
TRAVIS: I was told there would be no math.

00:30:05.062 --> 00:30:07.473
SAM: Sounds good!

00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:11.687
LAURA: Gah! I hate not having a calculator! Fine!

00:30:11.687 --> 00:30:15.916
MATT: "Ah! Great!" She pulls back and pulls some
keys out and hands them to the rest of you. Hands

00:30:15.916 --> 00:30:19.846
you some paperwork, shows you which rooms are
yours and says, "You're welcome to stay all you

00:30:19.846 --> 00:30:25.879
"like, ask questions, hang about. Just make sure
you don't do anything stupid near the Carvers."

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:29.427
ORION: Ooh! Like what? I do things like that all
the time!

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:31.999
LIAM: Sorry. Our Dwarvish is a little thick. Near
the--?

00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:33.188
MATT: "The Carvers, the Carvers!"

00:30:33.188 --> 00:30:34.618
LAURA: The carvas. Of course.

00:30:34.618 --> 00:30:35.582
MATT: "The Carvers!"

00:30:35.582 --> 00:30:36.700
ORION: The Converse! Of course!

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.525
SAM: The Car Verse?

00:30:37.525 --> 00:30:39.738
MATT: "Is this your first time in Kraghammer?"

00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:40.375
ALL: Yes!

00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:44.272
MATT: "The Carvers are the guard that run this
city. They're the ones that keep the law."

00:30:44.272 --> 00:30:44.985
LAURA: The scar!

00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:46.554
MATT: "Yes, the armor, the Carvers!"

00:30:46.554 --> 00:30:48.649
TRAVIS: Yeah, what is with the scar? I've got one
myself.

00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:55.953
MATT: She leans back and as you reveal the rather
gnarled scar on your chest. She reels back a bit

00:30:55.953 --> 00:30:59.710
and two of the nearby dwarves go, "Yeah!" They
chug down their drinks.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.238
TRAVIS: Yeah! More drinking!

00:31:01.238 --> 00:31:04.703
MATT: They start showing their scars and are like,
"Oh no! I got this one from an iron bolt!" They

00:31:04.703 --> 00:31:10.203
start talking about different creatures they
fought. "All right. Well, the Carvers are a bit of

00:31:10.203 --> 00:31:16.976
"a-- how do I put it? A military class in this
city. They run a very tight ship on the streets,

00:31:16.976 --> 00:31:17.881
"so be careful."

00:31:17.881 --> 00:31:23.250
TALIESIN: That shouldn't be a problem. Mostly we
are looking for Lord Greyspine, if I recall. We

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.331
have business with him.

00:31:24.331 --> 00:31:28.076
LAURA: We might have business with you, if you've
seen a halfling come through.

00:31:28.076 --> 00:31:32.651
MATT: She thinks to herself and goes, "There was a
halfling woman, but she was staying at the

00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:33.607
"Firebrook Inn."

00:31:33.607 --> 00:31:34.590
LAURA: The Firebrook.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.837
MATT: "The bottom floor, for a couple of weeks.
There was talk about her. She got in a few fights

00:31:38.837 --> 00:31:43.803
"herself. The one with the silver armor? That one?
Yeah, she was a firebrand if ever I saw one. Right

00:31:43.803 --> 00:31:44.952
up my alley, I like that one."

00:31:44.952 --> 00:31:47.565
TALIESIN: How long ago would you say this was?

00:31:47.565 --> 00:31:50.440
MATT: "Oh, she went through a few weeks. I haven't
seen her recently."

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.028
TALIESIN: Thank you. Perfect.

00:31:52.028 --> 00:31:59.054
TRAVIS: Is there a champion of the circle of
fighting in the tavern? Is there a reigning--

00:31:59.054 --> 00:32:00.430
SAM: Already, Grog?!

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.931
TRAVIS: Well, I have to know these things!

00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:04.651
TALIESIN: He has to do something.

00:32:04.651 --> 00:32:09.130
MATT: She turns the barrel that she has on the
table towards you a little bit and you can see the

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.555
actual symbol,

00:32:10.555 --> 00:32:17.627
this burned image on the side that says, "Balgus
Brewery." She goes, "That'll be Balgus. The one

00:32:17.627 --> 00:32:22.467
"that supplies us with what you're drinking. He's
the undefeated champion. But I don't think he's

00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:26.191
"quite right to fight at the moment." She points
towards the very edge of the bar and you see one

00:32:26.191 --> 00:32:30.629
older grizzled dwarf, long gray hair pulled into
straight braids in the back, big bushy beard

00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:36.105
that's all shoved up into his face because he's
asleep, drunk as a skunk, on the edge of the bar.

00:32:36.105 --> 00:32:42.666
TRAVIS: My type of dwarf. Maybe we'll can use him
as a merc later or something. All right, another

00:32:42.666 --> 00:32:43.457
time then.

00:32:43.457 --> 00:32:44.581
SAM: Another time.

00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:47.470
LIAM: Save it for a rainy day.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.525
TRAVIS: Does it rain down here?

00:32:49.525 --> 00:32:50.890
TALIESIN: I don't think they have rainy days.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:51.599
MATT: "You said Greyspine?"

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:54.632
LAURA: Yes, Greyspine.

00:32:54.632 --> 00:32:58.125
TALIESIN: We are looking to set up a meeting.

00:32:58.125 --> 00:32:59.831
MATT: "Which Greyspine?"

00:32:59.831 --> 00:33:01.776
SAM: Nostoc?

00:33:01.776 --> 00:33:07.429
MATT: "Nostoc Greyspine. He's definitely a
business type one."

00:33:07.429 --> 00:33:09.972
ORION: Well who's the friendlier Greypsine?

00:33:09.972 --> 00:33:13.633
MATT: "The friendlier of the types would probably
be the head of House Greyspine."

00:33:13.633 --> 00:33:16.106
MARISHA: Wait, how many Greypsines are there?

00:33:16.106 --> 00:33:19.876
MATT: "Oh, well there's probably several at this
point, I've lost track. The family line's been

00:33:19.876 --> 00:33:25.591
"going for a while. However, of House Greyspine
currently, Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine is the head

00:33:25.591 --> 00:33:30.738
"of this entire city. Voted in ten years ago,
actually. He's head of the council."

00:33:30.738 --> 00:33:31.855
MARISHA: Ironkeeper what?

00:33:31.855 --> 00:33:39.888
MATT: "Ironkeeper Gradim Greypsine. Gradim!
You're-- (sigh) These commoners. Learn to speak

00:33:39.888 --> 00:33:40.842
"the language!"

00:33:40.842 --> 00:33:42.039
ORION: I understood!

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:50.731
LIAM: Adra, may I ask, obviously we have no
dwarves in our little party.

00:33:50.731 --> 00:33:51.653
MATT: "Unfortunately."

00:33:51.653 --> 00:33:52.965
LAURA: Unfortunately for us.

00:33:52.965 --> 00:33:59.322
LIAM: Sorry, about that. You're very welcoming. We
appreciate that. How welcoming would you say the

00:33:59.322 --> 00:34:02.607
city is to outsiders? Would we stick out like a
sore thumb?

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:10.475
MATT: "Probably. As long as you don't do anything
stupid. As long as you keep the coin flowing, and

00:34:10.475 --> 00:34:15.321
"as long as you stay to the upper levels. The lower
levels you get to more of the business: the

00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:20.112
"miners, the forges, the foundries. When you get to
the business areas, that's where the guard gets

00:34:20.112 --> 00:34:22.611
"heavier and that's where folks don't
like you poking near their money."

00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:24.954
SAM: So the lower levels would have the mithral
mines?

00:34:24.954 --> 00:34:27.510
MATT: "<i>The</i> mithral mine, aye."

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.354
SAM: There's one?

00:34:28.354 --> 00:34:32.762
MATT: "There is one now. It's all been, and has
been for quite some time, completely helmed up and

00:34:32.762 --> 00:34:37.137
"run by House Greypsine. The Keystone Quarry is
what you're looking for."

00:34:37.137 --> 00:34:41.396
LIAM: We're not really interested in that. We just
want to see the city. Our business is elsewhere.

00:34:41.396 --> 00:34:45.309
MATT: "Yeah, I would not recommend it. Not without
proper business credentials on that. You'll end up

00:34:45.309 --> 00:34:46.443
"being questioned very heavily."

00:34:46.443 --> 00:34:48.081
LIAM: Sounds like a dirty business, anyway.

00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:48.644
LAURA: Right.

00:34:48.644 --> 00:34:52.499
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to stay away from those
miners Scanlan, that's a dirty business.

00:34:52.499 --> 00:34:55.782
MATT: She gives you a look almost like it was a
slightly racist statement, but then passes it off

00:34:55.782 --> 00:34:56.926
because you paid her a lot of coin today.

00:34:59.726 --> 00:35:00.937
MARISHA: So racist.

00:35:00.937 --> 00:35:02.983
LAURA: So No-stock. Nostoc?

00:35:02.983 --> 00:35:03.598
LIAM: Nostoc.

00:35:03.598 --> 00:35:05.372
LAURA: Nostoc Greyspine.

00:35:05.372 --> 00:35:06.279
MATT: "Yes."

00:35:06.279 --> 00:35:07.950
LAURA: You said that he's kind of a--?

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:12.853
MATT: "Oh, there's a reason he's the one put in
charge of the mines and the businesses and the foundries."

00:35:12.853 --> 00:35:14.120
LAURA: Oh. Where is he located, exactly?

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:21.187
MATT: "Well, if he's not home at the actual
Greyspine Manor-- which is a sprawling house. It

00:35:21.416 --> 00:35:22.331
contains all the ones who live there."

00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:23.279
TRAVIS: We're going there!

00:35:23.279 --> 00:35:32.027
MATT: "He's probably down at the actual--" What is
it? Pardon. Bear with me. Consult my notes! "He's

00:35:32.027 --> 00:35:38.345
"probably down by the Greyspine quarry itself,
keeping an eye on the business there." There's a

00:35:38.345 --> 00:35:43.708
nearby dwarf having a few drinks, goes, "Ah,
Greyspine, there's been troubles round there!

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:49.833
"Apparently, a friend of mine works there. Got a
big, nasty scar last week. Wouldn't even pay him

00:35:49.833 --> 00:35:54.148
"for his time off to heal. It's bullshit!" He slams
his drink down on the table.

00:35:54.148 --> 00:35:55.492
SAM: Down at the quarry?

00:35:55.492 --> 00:35:56.028
MATT: "Aye."

00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:59.103
MARISHA: How did your friend get this nasty cut?

00:35:59.103 --> 00:36:04.262
MATT: "He works there! Said there was things
pouring out of the caves. Goblins and the like!"

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.021
LAURA and SAM: Goblins?

00:36:06.021 --> 00:36:07.289
MATT: "Ah, goblins are nothing."

00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:08.050
LAURA: Of course not.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:12.143
MATT: "Seems there's something other than goblins
poking out through this hole. Just saying, that

00:36:12.143 --> 00:36:14.679
"business is in for a serious problem if it doesn't
change."

00:36:14.679 --> 00:36:19.599
LAURA: Does your friend ever have drinks here?
"No. He's been sober for two years. We're not

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:22.821
"friends anymore." Tugs on his beard a little bit.

00:36:22.821 --> 00:36:25.313
MARISHA: Oh. I'm sorry. I think.

00:36:25.313 --> 00:36:27.904
SAM: A lot to process.

00:36:27.904 --> 00:36:32.084
MATT: He pours another drink. At which point, Adra
slaps his hand and says, "Pay that. He bought one round!"

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.420
He finishes his drink and walks away.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.833
ORION: Excuse me, one thing, Adra, are there any
mystics in this particular town that study any

00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:40.624
arcane arts?

00:36:40.624 --> 00:36:44.235
MATT: "Of course! What, you think dwarves are just
the baseline folks who brawl each other?"

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:48.328
MARISHA: So many racist comments. Jeez!

00:36:48.328 --> 00:36:52.848
MATT: "What you're looking for is House
Thunderbrand. They are the ones who, by blood,

00:36:52.848 --> 00:36:55.247
"have the arcane arts in their family line."

00:36:55.247 --> 00:36:56.238
ORION: Interesting.

00:36:56.238 --> 00:37:02.906
MATT: "They run most of the enchantment process in
the city, they also train-- they call it train,

00:37:02.906 --> 00:37:07.174
"some of us call it more 'indoctrination.' But,
they're definitely the focus of all arcane arts

00:37:07.174 --> 00:37:08.221
"here in Kraghammer."

00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:09.440
ORION: Thank you.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:16.942
SAM: Thank you for your time, Adra. Carry on with
your evening. We'll seek you out if we have any

00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:17.660
more questions.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.461
MATT: "Certainly. Now if you don't mind," She
scoots you aside, and you see a line, a queue of

00:37:21.461 --> 00:37:26.300
dwarves behind her, with their empty cups, waiting
to get to her to fill up the drinks that you bought.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.368
MARISHA: Oh, that's-- we did promise that.

00:37:27.368 --> 00:37:30.429
LIAM: Enjoy, gentlemen! And lady.

00:37:30.429 --> 00:37:31.816
LAURA: What time of day is it?

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:36.561
MATT: Best that you can tell, inside-- you can't.
You just arrived, probably around 3:00 or 4:00 in

00:37:36.561 --> 00:37:40.942
the afternoon, so you're probably pushing sunset
right about now.

00:37:40.942 --> 00:37:42.964
LAURA: Do dwarves carry the same schedule?

00:37:42.964 --> 00:37:43.798
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:37:43.798 --> 00:37:45.471
LAURA: Does anyone know?

00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:47.092
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

00:37:47.092 --> 00:37:48.327
MATT: Make an intelligence check!

00:37:48.327 --> 00:37:51.042
TRAVIS: Oh! Roll it! You're the first one.

00:37:51.042 --> 00:37:53.035
LIAM: First die rolling. Nice!

00:37:53.035 --> 00:37:56.402
LAURA: 18, plus, what is that? Investigation? Or
insight?

00:37:56.402 --> 00:37:59.581
MATT: This would be a straight intelligence roll
on this one, so your general knowledge of dwarves.

00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:01.056
LAURA: Oh. 20, then.

00:38:01.056 --> 00:38:07.809
MATT: 20. That's not too bad! In your experience,
you know dwarves, depending on their lifestyle and

00:38:07.809 --> 00:38:13.204
what they do for a living, their clocks can run
differently, but for the most part, they run in

00:38:13.204 --> 00:38:18.098
tandem with most other races just because it makes
it easier for dealing with outside forces. But,

00:38:18.098 --> 00:38:23.009
like I said, it's very variable. There is no set,
locked time of: this is morning, this is evening,

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:25.438
they just sleep when they need to and wake up when
they need to.

00:38:25.438 --> 00:38:27.376
LAURA: All right. Good to know.

00:38:27.376 --> 00:38:29.145
MARISHA: It's like living in Alaska.

00:38:29.145 --> 00:38:30.099
LAURA: Right!

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:32.605
MATT and MARISHA: Dwarven Alaska.

00:38:32.605 --> 00:38:35.819
SAM: Yes, fellows, what should we do?

00:38:35.819 --> 00:38:42.169
LAURA: Check out the Firebrook Inn, yes. That was
where Lady Kima was staying. Also, I think

00:38:42.366 --> 00:38:45.917
somebody should run reconnaissance on Greyspine
Manor.

00:38:45.917 --> 00:38:47.078
TRAVIS: Like stealth, you mean?

00:38:47.078 --> 00:38:50.273
LIAM: Yes. I don't think we should try to go
directly to the mines and find Nostoc.

00:38:50.273 --> 00:38:50.861
LAURA: No.

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:51.502
SAM: Agreed.

00:38:51.502 --> 00:38:57.042
LIAM: No, I think maybe we should enlist the help
of a dwarf here in the city to introduce us to

00:38:57.042 --> 00:39:01.993
Nostoc. I mean, we're not trying to raise hell, or
bring down a thousand dwarves upon us.

00:39:01.993 --> 00:39:03.849
TALIESIN: There's no sense attempting to be
subtle.

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:05.616
SAM: Although, that does sound fun.

00:39:05.616 --> 00:39:09.210
TALIESIN: Everyone's going to know that we're
here, and what we're looking for by morning.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.028
TRAVIS: Why don't we get old Drunky Greybeard
that's got his face down on the bar to do it?

00:39:12.028 --> 00:39:17.174
LAURA: Yeah, but he's very-- Well, let's ask him.
Maybe he's drunk enough to help us. Saddle up, Grog!

00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:18.137
TRAVIS: Me?

00:39:18.137 --> 00:39:19.382
LAURA: People seem to like you here.

00:39:19.382 --> 00:39:20.559
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm really-- oh, that's true.

00:39:20.559 --> 00:39:21.805
LIAM: You're the connoisseur.

00:39:21.805 --> 00:39:25.300
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll part my armor, so he can see
the scar. Post up on the bar.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.376
MARISHA: Take him a drink!

00:39:26.376 --> 00:39:27.124
TRAVIS: All right.

00:39:27.124 --> 00:39:31.464
LAURA: Yes, take him a drink. A very large drink.

00:39:31.464 --> 00:39:36.544
TRAVIS: I would like to get the largest goblet you
have of ale, and I would like to go over to, what

00:39:36.544 --> 00:39:37.936
was his name? Bulbous?

00:39:37.936 --> 00:39:40.380
MATT: Balgus.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.381
ALL: Balgus.

00:39:42.381 --> 00:39:43.567
TRAVIS: I had it right.

00:39:43.567 --> 00:39:44.752
MATT: Close.

00:39:44.752 --> 00:39:46.889
TRAVIS: Balgus. I would like to--

00:39:46.889 --> 00:39:48.202
SAM: I'm coming with Grog.

00:39:48.202 --> 00:39:56.220
TRAVIS: Yes. I would like to go up and put my
scar, and post up on the bar and (throat clearing)

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.976
MATT: (snores)

00:39:59.976 --> 00:40:03.719
TRAVIS: (louder throat clearing)

00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:10.298
SAM: I take out my flute and I play a little
Healing Words spell and try to heal him of his drunkenness.

00:40:10.298 --> 00:40:12.549
LAURA: Just a little of his drunkenness, not all
of his drunkenness.

00:40:12.549 --> 00:40:13.964
TRAVIS: He likes him drunk, so maybe like, half.

00:40:13.964 --> 00:40:18.636
MATT: You play your tune, a beautiful little tune
that saunters through the air.The magical energies

00:40:18.636 --> 00:40:23.386
emanate from the notes you make, drift into his
torso; you can see a slight glow and he,

00:40:23.386 --> 00:40:30.308
"(grumbling) Where's that blasted music coming
from?" His hand goes out and paws towards the flute.

00:40:30.308 --> 00:40:34.639
SAM: Huh, I don't know where that was coming
from.

00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:40.972
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to disturb you, your name is of
great repute around these parts.

00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:47.207
MATT: He wipes a globule of drool that's crusted
into his beard. "Aye, you've bothered me nap. What

00:40:47.207 --> 00:40:49.470
"do you want from Balgus?"

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:56.810
TRAVIS: We were wondering if we might, perchance,
acquire your knowledge about town, for a bit of a search.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.049
LAURA: (whispered) Talk to him about fighting
first.

00:40:59.049 --> 00:41:03.220
TRAVIS: Right, I hear you're a good fighter. You
look strong.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.971
MATT: "I've heard the same."

00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:11.554
TRAVIS: Right. How often do you get challengers in
this tavern?

00:41:11.554 --> 00:41:19.500
MATT: "Not as often as I get woken up from my
sleep. Which is never. Because only stupid people

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.775
"do that."

00:41:20.775 --> 00:41:22.380
LAURA: Lost cause. Abandon ship!

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.630
TRAVIS: Right. I have an intelligence of six, I
know what I'm doing.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.373
LAURA: Okay.

00:41:27.373 --> 00:41:31.890
TRAVIS: There is a very pretty lady over there,
with slightly pointy ears. (whispering) I'm

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:36.547
talking about you or you. (normal volume) There's
two of them! They were actually wanting to ask you

00:41:36.547 --> 00:41:38.650
a question if you wouldn't mind.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:40.217
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

00:41:40.217 --> 00:41:41.135
TRAVIS: Me?!

00:41:41.135 --> 00:41:42.069
SAM: Why is he doing this?

00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.975
LAURA: Why would you throw this to us?

00:41:42.975 --> 00:41:43.943
MARISHA: I know!

00:41:43.943 --> 00:41:46.974
TRAVIS: Because I was either going to fight him or
I was going to throw boobs at him, and I went with boobs.

00:41:46.974 --> 00:41:48.977
MARISHA: He realized he was sinking.

00:41:48.977 --> 00:41:51.808
MATT: That's level ten you get that, by the way.
Throw Boobs.

00:41:51.808 --> 00:41:53.810
LAURA: Persuasion. Oh! Good roll.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.969
TRAVIS: Look at that: one. 19!

00:41:57.969 --> 00:41:58.922
LAURA: Woo!

00:41:58.922 --> 00:42:10.062
MATT: 19? He takes a moment, and grabs the drink
that you prepared from his hand and goes (gulps).

00:42:10.062 --> 00:42:11.378
TRAVIS: Nice form.

00:42:11.378 --> 00:42:16.304
MATT: "You've got five minutes." Then he stretches
his back a bit. This gnarled hunch that he holds

00:42:16.304 --> 00:42:21.472
in his physical posture, flexes it a bit, and now
you can see the rippling muscles that show beneath

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:26.883
his tunic. This is a built dwarf. You don't know
what past he's had, moving boulders or forging

00:42:26.883 --> 00:42:32.625
crazy iron shit, but there's a reason this guy has
a reputation. He stands up off of his stool, which

00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:36.629
you can now hear crack with the weight of a dwarf,
which are made for normal dwarves. This guy is

00:42:36.629 --> 00:42:41.711
solid muscle. He saunters over, looks about for a
second, almost like he's looking for his next

00:42:41.711 --> 00:42:47.459
target. Sees the pointy ears, sees the pointy
ears, and goes (sighs) and saunters up to the

00:42:47.459 --> 00:42:49.286
table, slams his hand down.

00:42:49.286 --> 00:42:50.520
MARISHA: Why is he coming towards us?

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.362
TRAVIS: Because I told him to. Because you're
supposed to ask him--

00:42:52.362 --> 00:42:53.151
SAM: Boobs!

00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:54.793
LIAM: Steady as she goes, ladies.

00:42:54.793 --> 00:42:56.041
MATT: He sits down.

00:42:56.041 --> 00:42:58.464
MARISHA: (whispered to Laura) You're better at
this than I am.

00:42:58.464 --> 00:43:01.331
MATT: "You called for Balgus, why?"

00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:03.716
LAURA: Oh! Hello, Balgus.

00:43:03.716 --> 00:43:06.055
MARISHA: Hi, Balgus.

00:43:06.055 --> 00:43:09.469
LAURA: We just heard you're so impressive and
masculine.

00:43:09.469 --> 00:43:10.458
MARISHA: Yes!

00:43:10.458 --> 00:43:11.860
LAURA: We really wanted to talk to you.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.395
ORION: I use my Earring of Whisper to Vex. Cool it
down.

00:43:15.395 --> 00:43:16.609
LAURA: Oh sh-- okay.

00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:19.263
ORION: Calm down. Not so sexy.

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:25.472
MARISHA: I reach out and I stroke his bicep
because I can't hear that.

00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:27.475
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:43:27.475 --> 00:43:29.479
ORION: Keyleth, stop doing that.

00:43:29.479 --> 00:43:30.647
LIAM: I disagree, heat it up.

00:43:30.647 --> 00:43:32.304
LAURA: Roll so good.

00:43:32.304 --> 00:43:37.464
MARISHA: I'm really low in charisma. I'm really
awkward. Persuasion.

00:43:37.464 --> 00:43:41.664
MATT: Roll your persuasion.

00:43:41.664 --> 00:43:42.638
TALIESIN: (groans)

00:43:42.638 --> 00:43:43.300
LAURA: Oh no, what was it?

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.639
MARISHA: I rolled a two?

00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:45.882
MATT: Plus?

00:43:45.882 --> 00:43:51.220
MARISHA: Plus my persuasion of zero, because I
have a shitty charisma.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.635
MATT: As your arm reaches for his bicep--

00:43:53.635 --> 00:43:55.229
MARISHA: I didn't say anything. I just touched
him!

00:43:55.229 --> 00:44:01.062
MATT: As your arm reaches for his bicep, his hand,
belying his grumpy, half-asleep haze-- with

00:44:01.062 --> 00:44:05.724
unnatural speed reaches out and slaps your hand to
the side. Not painfully, but just, "No touching

00:44:05.724 --> 00:44:08.640
"the drunk dwarf."

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:17.129
LAURA: Sorry about my friend, Balgus. She's just
so impressed with your muscles. We've heard

00:44:17.129 --> 00:44:19.947
amazing things about you here.

00:44:19.947 --> 00:44:20.871
MATT: "Have you?"

00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:21.705
LAURA: We have.

00:44:21.705 --> 00:44:23.131
MATT "Tell me, what have you heard?"

00:44:23.131 --> 00:44:26.901
LAURA: We've heard that no fighter can match your
skill.

00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:28.890
MATT: "You've heard correct."

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:32.725
LAURA: We've heard that you know more about this
town than anyone else.

00:44:32.725 --> 00:44:35.971
MATT: "I've been around a bit, yeah."

00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:41.393
LAURA: Yeah. I bet nobody knows more about the
Greyspines than you do and they've been around a

00:44:41.393 --> 00:44:42.545
long time.

00:44:42.545 --> 00:44:45.554
MATT: "Political ass minds is what they are."

00:44:45.554 --> 00:44:46.714
SAM: Assmanes?

00:44:46.714 --> 00:44:48.292
MATT: "Not keen to them-- ass minds."

00:44:48.292 --> 00:44:49.363
MARISHA: Ass mines?

00:44:49.363 --> 00:44:50.891
MATT: "They've got minds of an ass."

00:44:50.891 --> 00:44:58.142
MARISHA: Oh, I thought you meant like, mines that
ex-- Sorry. Go ahead. No, ass minds. Yes, they

00:44:58.142 --> 00:44:59.383
have ass minds.

00:44:59.383 --> 00:45:01.069
MATT: "The Greyspines are no friend of mine. "

00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:04.306
LAURA: No, I've heard they're terrible. What do
you do, Balgus?

00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:07.130
MATT: "What do I do? I own the brewery in town!"

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.203
LAURA: (gasp) You do?

00:45:08.203 --> 00:45:09.167
MATT: "The only one."

00:45:09.167 --> 00:45:10.262
LAURA: The best brewery?

00:45:10.262 --> 00:45:15.768
MATT: "The only! Of course it's the best!" I've
put everyone out of business. We export to most of Tal'Dorei."

00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:18.885
LAURA: This ale is amazing, that I'm drinking
right now.

00:45:18.885 --> 00:45:22.918
MATT: "Damn right it is!" You set it down and he
takes it from your hand a little bit and takes a

00:45:22.918 --> 00:45:26.798
sip himself and sets it down again. (inhales
deeply) (spits)

00:45:26.798 --> 00:45:36.143
MARISHA: It seems that you aren't challenged often
in business and in fighting.

00:45:36.143 --> 00:45:42.105
ORION: I saunter over. Hello! My name is Tiberius
Stormwind!

00:45:42.105 --> 00:45:43.370
TRAVIS: We're all going to die.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:48.951
MATT: He glances over and says, "Dragonborn. I
haven't fought one of your kind in a long time."

00:45:48.951 --> 00:45:52.331
ORION: Oh! Who's the last dragonborn you fought?
Do you remember his name?

00:45:52.331 --> 00:45:56.184
MATT: "I recall his name was 'Broken and
Bloody.'"

00:45:56.184 --> 00:45:58.531
SAM: I think that's a friend of yours.

00:45:58.531 --> 00:46:04.264
ORION: No, I know him! I know the Bloody family,
they're terrible people. Anyway, my associates and

00:46:04.264 --> 00:46:09.046
I were wondering if you might come-- Is that what
we're doing? Trying to get him to come with us?

00:46:09.046 --> 00:46:11.096
LAURA: Anyway!

00:46:11.096 --> 00:46:16.207
SAM: We're trying to find out more about
Greyspine. Where he might be or who his associates

00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:16.745
might be.

00:46:16.745 --> 00:46:19.134
MARISHA: Gee, I'm so glad you came over.

00:46:19.134 --> 00:46:23.323
ORION: Would you like to accompany us on this
journey that we're taking? We're trying to find

00:46:23.323 --> 00:46:26.792
the Greyspines and you seem like you would want to
come in on this.

00:46:26.792 --> 00:46:29.210
TALIESIN: We think there might be something rotten
in the mines.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.906
MATT: Make a persuasion roll. You can assist if
you like.

00:46:31.906 --> 00:46:33.992
TALIESIN: I'm assisting in this persuasion roll,
good god.

00:46:33.992 --> 00:46:35.041
MATT: That just means he has advantage.

00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:37.250
ORION: Oh, I get advantage?

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.973
TALIESIN: 21.

00:46:38.973 --> 00:46:40.888
MATT: Yeah, so you get advantage on this roll.

00:46:40.888 --> 00:46:41.716
SAM: So you roll twice.

00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:42.791
MARISHA: What was the first thing you rolled?

00:46:42.791 --> 00:46:44.924
ORION: Three. I'll take the 18.

00:46:44.924 --> 00:46:46.906
MARISHA: Definitely take that 18.

00:46:46.906 --> 00:46:48.114
ORION: Oh and plus my--

00:46:48.114 --> 00:46:49.277
MARISHA: Persuasion.

00:46:49.277 --> 00:46:50.902
MATT: He looks at you keenly, which--

00:46:50.902 --> 00:46:52.103
ORION: Which is a nine.

00:46:52.571 --> 00:46:54.271
LAURA: Whoa, you have a nine persuasion?!

00:46:54.271 --> 00:46:55.658
ORION: That's why I talk.

00:46:55.658 --> 00:46:56.787
MARISHA: He's pretty charismatic.

00:46:57.356 --> 00:47:03.566
MATT: He goes, "Well no, I don't really want to go
anywhere with you. But if you're looking to go

00:47:03.566 --> 00:47:09.329
"ahead and talk to the Greyspines, you don't want
to go empty-handed. It's customary to come with a

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:10.333
"gift of some kind."

00:47:10.333 --> 00:47:11.128
LAURA: Oh really?

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.141
SAM: What might they like?

00:47:12.141 --> 00:47:16.265
MATT: "Well, let's just say, I have the finest
brewery in the city."

00:47:16.265 --> 00:47:16.888
LAURA: Oh!

00:47:16.888 --> 00:47:24.236
MATT: "I have some fine, very rare, very exotic
drinks that I could, perchance, sell to you."

00:47:24.236 --> 00:47:25.852
LIAM: Pay the dwarf.

00:47:25.852 --> 00:47:28.083
LAURA: How much for this exotic ale?

00:47:28.083 --> 00:47:30.578
MATT: "How exotic you wanting?"

00:47:30.578 --> 00:47:35.007
LAURA: We want to get in the door. We want him to
like us.

00:47:35.007 --> 00:47:44.151
MATT: "I can give you the finest of thistle
branch, dark blood wine. This was crafted by

00:47:44.151 --> 00:47:50.577
"myself, from a rare bloodthistle branch that I had
brought over from the far-off city of Kamordah.

00:47:50.577 --> 00:47:58.284
"This, I personally oversaw. It took me four years
to fill this barrel full. It'll cost you 500 gold

00:47:58.284 --> 00:48:01.991
"pieces. But it is a king's red wine!"

00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:05.696
MARISHA: Can I do a persuasion check-- a
perception check to see if he's lying?

00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:07.101
MATT: This would be insight. Go ahead and roll
insight.

00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:09.221
TALIESIN: I'm going to go walk over to Grog really
quickly.

00:48:09.221 --> 00:48:12.031
MARISHA: 27.

00:48:12.031 --> 00:48:14.640
MATT: He seems too drunk to lie.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.798
SAM: Let's just do it.

00:48:16.798 --> 00:48:27.142
LAURA: Tell you what, Balgus. We have some very
rare items with us that I think you might be

00:48:27.142 --> 00:48:27.982
interested in.

00:48:27.982 --> 00:48:29.897
MATT: "Make it quick! You've got one minute."

00:48:29.897 --> 00:48:31.553
LAURA: We've got one minute? Well, we've got--

00:48:31.553 --> 00:48:36.210
MATT: "My time is far worth the 500 gold you've
already been talking about."

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:40.197
LAURA: We've got this with us right now.

00:48:40.197 --> 00:48:41.712
TRAVIS: We've got a bunch of dragon pieces.

00:48:41.712 --> 00:48:43.978
ORION: Do you like dragon pieces?

00:48:43.978 --> 00:48:48.035
TRAVIS: We've got 37 dragon teeth, one dragon eye,
four cups of dragon blood--

00:48:48.035 --> 00:48:56.025
LAURA: We've got this cup of dragon blood! Which I
know can be added to ale or wine and makes it

00:48:56.025 --> 00:48:58.231
quite sensational.

00:48:58.231 --> 00:49:05.546
MATT: He takes the sealed cup and sloshes it
around in his hand. The actual liquid is

00:49:05.546 --> 00:49:13.468
coagulated to such a point that it's less of a
blood and more of a gelatin. (sloshing sounds)

00:49:13.468 --> 00:49:14.594
TRAVIS: It gets better with age.

00:49:14.594 --> 00:49:15.801
LAURA: Exactly, a spoon of it!

00:49:15.801 --> 00:49:19.530
MATT: He peeks it open and (sniffs). "Yes!"

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.137
LAURA: I think that's really expensive, actually.

00:49:21.137 --> 00:49:25.352
MATT: "I can have this appraised, but if you want
to do a straight trade for the barrel for this,

00:49:25.352 --> 00:49:26.739
"I'll take you up on that."

00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:27.766
LAURA: Shit, no.

00:49:27.766 --> 00:49:29.004
SAM: Just go for it.

00:49:29.004 --> 00:49:30.889
LAURA: All right, fine! One cup of it.

00:49:30.889 --> 00:49:42.515
MATT: "All right." He takes the cup, puts it in a
small satchel on his side. "Adra!" "Aye, what do

00:49:42.515 --> 00:49:49.808
"you want, you drunken bastard?" "They've bought me
thistle blood wine. Take it out back. Here's the

00:49:49.808 --> 00:49:55.281
"key." He tosses her the key. She grabs it and
goes, "Really? Ooh, just walked in, they're buying

00:49:55.281 --> 00:50:02.971
"fancy." She comes back with two of her barmaiders
who are begrudgingly carrying it with her. It's a

00:50:02.971 --> 00:50:10.588
nice barrel. It has a gold trim. The actual bands
that hold the wood together is gold. The branding

00:50:10.588 --> 00:50:15.467
on the side is gold leafed into the wood. It's
fine, exquisite, we're talking top shelf

00:50:15.467 --> 00:50:18.134
BevMo-style, awesome dwarven wine.

00:50:18.134 --> 00:50:20.284
MARISHA: Top shelf at BevMo!

00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:26.414
MATT: He pats it and he goes, "All yours. If this
doesn't get you in the door, I'll eat my shoe."

00:50:27.368 --> 00:50:28.465
TRAVIS: Have you ever done that?

00:50:28.465 --> 00:50:32.610
MATT: "Maybe, I forget a lot of nights."

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:34.830
SAM: Where might that door be?

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:41.744
MATT: "Minute's up, you'll have to ask around, but
it was great doing business with you." He walks

00:50:41.744 --> 00:50:42.534
away from the table.

00:50:42.534 --> 00:50:44.177
TRAVIS: I put it in the bag of holding.

00:50:44.177 --> 00:50:45.752
MATT: It does not fit in the bag of holding.

00:50:45.752 --> 00:50:46.658
LAURA and TRAVIS: What?!

00:50:46.658 --> 00:50:51.004
MATT: The barrel is too big, you barely got Dork
the ox in there. Which, for the record, they did

00:50:51.004 --> 00:50:56.267
fit a small ox in the bag of holding and then
realized later on that there was no airflow.

00:50:56.267 --> 00:50:57.929
TRAVIS: He came out!

00:50:57.929 --> 00:51:00.984
TALIESIN: I feel like we weren't going to discuss
that. I felt that that was in the past.

00:51:00.984 --> 00:51:02.708
MATT: I felt that was a necessary story.

00:51:02.708 --> 00:51:04.195
SAM: Maybe if we drank some of it it would fit.

00:51:04.195 --> 00:51:09.057
LAURA: The troll dick. Is that still in there or
no?

00:51:09.057 --> 00:51:10.581
TRAVIS: No, we actually got rid of the troll
dick.

00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:11.403
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:51:11.403 --> 00:51:15.651
TALIESIN: Did we trade the troll dick for
something?

00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:17.945
MARISHA: I thought we like used it as a weapon.

00:51:17.945 --> 00:51:20.840
TRAVIS: I offered it up, but by that time it had
turned into a slimy--

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.811
LAURA: Ew.

00:51:21.811 --> 00:51:24.564
MARISHA: I thought we threw it at somebody.

00:51:24.564 --> 00:51:31.802
LAURA: Can I stop Adra then and ask her where
Greyspine Manor is? Keep, manor, whatever.

00:51:31.802 --> 00:51:37.899
MATT: "Ah, well I can have him do it." She pokes
one of the barmaiders who turns around. This one's

00:51:37.899 --> 00:51:41.977
younger, he looks like he's frazzled and maybe new
here or at least trying to make his way. He goes,

00:51:41.977 --> 00:51:47.667
"Okay, I can show you around, just follow me
outside, come follow me." He walks out. He's got a

00:51:47.667 --> 00:51:54.550
little apron on. He leads you guys outside. He
brings you to the edge of the outer walkway of the

00:51:54.550 --> 00:52:00.187
central ring you're on. He points across the way
and what you can see is a series of marble pillars

00:52:00.187 --> 00:52:06.314
that outline a residential district that opens and
consumes the other side of the central ring of

00:52:06.314 --> 00:52:14.905
Kraghammer. He says, "If you go past far in that
way, you'll look for the house of Greyspine. It's

00:52:14.905 --> 00:52:20.935
"the one that has dark black marble with gold
tinting inside the spiralling vein of the marble,

00:52:20.956 --> 00:52:27.833
"it's gold. The gate outside is wrought iron, black
iron, that's topped with a series of pikes and--"

00:52:27.833 --> 00:52:36.502
Pike awkwardly looks sickened, not
understanding. "The real key point is, if you look

00:52:36.502 --> 00:52:42.351
"on the front yard, you'll see a dwarven statue of
the current ironkeeper himself. That's where

00:52:42.351 --> 00:52:43.363
"you'll want to go."

00:52:43.363 --> 00:52:45.221
SAM: Yes, very helpful, young man.

00:52:45.221 --> 00:52:45.931
LAURA: Thank you so much.

00:52:45.931 --> 00:52:50.339
MATT: "Of course. If you get the chance, you could
fill out a little form saying how helpful I've been--"

00:52:50.339 --> 00:52:52.157
SAM: Are there suggestion cards here?

00:52:52.157 --> 00:52:54.052
MARISHA: Oh, absolutely.

00:52:54.052 --> 00:52:58.014
MATT: "Here." He pulls out a small parchment and
hands it to you. It's handwritten with a couple of checkboxes.

00:52:58.522 --> 00:53:00.217
ORION: You should give us all a copy so you will
have multiple.

00:53:00.217 --> 00:53:01.213
MATT: "I only have one."

00:53:01.213 --> 00:53:02.408
ORION: Oh, okay, that's fine.

00:53:02.408 --> 00:53:03.137
MATT: "Sorry!"

00:53:03.137 --> 00:53:04.922
SAM: Confidence needs improvement.

00:53:04.922 --> 00:53:07.405
LAURA: Oh, it's okay, we have a wonderful writer.

00:53:07.869 --> 00:53:11.551
TALIESIN: I'll rustle up a few. That's fine, why
not. It's what I do, apparently.

00:53:11.551 --> 00:53:12.863
MATT: He runs back into the tavern.

00:53:12.863 --> 00:53:15.658
SAM: All right, shall we go to the manor?

00:53:15.658 --> 00:53:18.024
LAURA: Do we want to do the manor right now? What
time is it?

00:53:18.024 --> 00:53:19.988
SAM: 5:00 or 6:00.

00:53:19.988 --> 00:53:21.568
TRAVIS: We got to sleep.

00:53:21.568 --> 00:53:25.143
LAURA: We might not want to bug him when he's, you
know, having dinner.

00:53:25.143 --> 00:53:29.672
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, that gate's going to jack
us up. It's going to be full of trouble.

00:53:29.672 --> 00:53:31.371
SAM: All right, yes, let's go sleep.

00:53:31.371 --> 00:53:32.270
TRAVIS: Let's sleep.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:33.810
LAURA: Well, it's only 6:00.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.512
SAM: Well, then we have time to do other things.

00:53:36.512 --> 00:53:37.689
ORION: How long is a short rest?

00:53:37.689 --> 00:53:39.301
MATT: Short rest is around ten minutes or so.

00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:40.517
ORION: I want to take short rest.

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:45.456
MATT: You've technically been short resting in the
tavern. It's more of like a post battle-- like,

00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:47.264
take a breather,

00:53:47.264 --> 00:53:52.463
bandage your wounds, settle yourself after a
harrowing experience. That's what a short rest is.

00:53:52.499 --> 00:53:54.778
ORION: What was the arcane magic, the manor?

00:53:55.368 --> 00:53:57.448
MATT: Oh, what you're looking for is the House
Thunderbrand.

00:53:57.448 --> 00:53:59.664
ORION: I want to head in that direction.

00:53:59.664 --> 00:54:02.148
MATT: Okay, so you're dividing from the party?
Okay.

00:54:02.148 --> 00:54:05.049
ORION: Oh, I'm going to House Thunderbrand, if
anybody wants to come with me.

00:54:05.049 --> 00:54:06.906
LAURA: What are you doing? I can't understand you
with that popcorn in your mouth.

00:54:06.906 --> 00:54:12.585
ORION: Sorry! I'm going to House Thunderbrand
before turning in this evening. I've had a nice

00:54:12.585 --> 00:54:15.820
little short rest and I would like to ask them a
few questions.

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:16.461
LAURA: All right.

00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:17.487
TRAVIS: Yeah, go ahead, okay.

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:21.264
SAM: Is there any recon that's going to happen
tonight?

00:54:21.264 --> 00:54:22.938
LAURA: I think that you and I are going to go to
Greyspine?

00:54:22.938 --> 00:54:24.028
LIAM: We'll check out the house.

00:54:24.028 --> 00:54:24.838
SAM: Do you need any help?

00:54:24.838 --> 00:54:26.272
LIAM: Sure, you can come with us.

00:54:26.272 --> 00:54:28.401
SAM: No, I don't want you to say yes.

00:54:28.401 --> 00:54:32.102
LAURA: Then no, we'll stealth our way.

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:39.021
LIAM: Just a moment. Pike, you seem very distant.
It's very strange, are you all right?

00:54:39.021 --> 00:54:42.111
LAURA: Pike's not listening, she's looking at the
chat room.

00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:44.710
SAM: She's feeling ill. Does she need to lie
down?

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:48.633
MATT: Pike is feeling, and for those of you who
are curious in the chat room, once again, elements

00:54:48.633 --> 00:54:50.912
of this are house ruled, so don't complain.

00:54:50.912 --> 00:54:53.545
LAURA: Oh, players.

00:54:53.545 --> 00:55:02.272
MATT: We keep short rest to ten minutes because it
makes it move faster. Pike is going along, she

00:55:02.272 --> 00:55:08.822
seems to be a little distracted, she can't quite
understand. She says, "I don't know, I feel like

00:55:08.822 --> 00:55:10.966
"I've been here before. It's hard to explain."

00:55:10.966 --> 00:55:11.743
TRAVIS: What?

00:55:11.743 --> 00:55:18.178
MATT: "Anyway, I'm probably going to go rest for
the evening." She heads back to the tavern.

00:55:18.178 --> 00:55:19.481
TRAVIS: The fuck does that mean?

00:55:19.481 --> 00:55:20.937
SAM: We'll find out next week.

00:55:20.937 --> 00:55:23.908
TRAVIS: But first, whores in the bedroom!

00:55:23.908 --> 00:55:26.351
LAURA: Lovely.

00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:33.397
SAM: Grog and I go in search of a, shall we say
politely, whorehouse.

00:55:33.397 --> 00:55:35.749
MATT: The polite term.

00:55:35.749 --> 00:55:39.366
LIAM: Well, the cleric's away, the bard shall
play.

00:55:39.366 --> 00:55:43.423
TRAVIS: We need a massage. On my crotch.

00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:44.523
LAURA: You and I stealth.

00:55:44.523 --> 00:55:48.322
MATT: You guys make your way to the Greyspine
Manor, you guys head for that, you head to Thunderbrand.

00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:49.678
SAM: Is Grog going to find someone his size?

00:55:52.378 --> 00:55:57.223
MARISHA: Percy and I spend some time making some
really nice comment cards for--

00:55:57.902 --> 00:56:01.084
TALIESIN: We're going to make some beautiful
comment cards.

00:56:01.084 --> 00:56:02.150
MARISHA: For what's his name?

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.918
MATT: His name is Balan.

00:56:03.918 --> 00:56:05.482
ALL: Balan.

00:56:05.482 --> 00:56:07.557
MARISHA: We're going to make some wonderful
comment cards for Balan.

00:56:07.557 --> 00:56:09.684
LIAM: Oh, Percy is wonderful with calligraphy;
you've shown me.

00:56:09.684 --> 00:56:10.874
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you.

00:56:10.874 --> 00:56:14.422
MATT: Okay, so you'll get to that. You guys do
manage to find what's called The Stone's Pillow.

00:56:16.102 --> 00:56:17.640
TRAVIS: The Stone's Pillow?

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.388
MATT: The Stone's Pillow.

00:56:19.908 --> 00:56:21.237
TRAVIS: I love it.

00:56:21.237 --> 00:56:25.678
MATT: It's an establishment of comfort and ease,
and will run you both for the evening, as you are

00:56:25.678 --> 00:56:28.477
not Kraghammer locals, 30 gold for the night
each.

00:56:28.477 --> 00:56:29.855
TRAVIS: A bargain.

00:56:29.855 --> 00:56:31.183
SAM: We'll take it.

00:56:31.183 --> 00:56:32.531
LAURA: 30 gold?!

00:56:32.531 --> 00:56:38.065
SAM: What sort of ladies will we find there?

00:56:39.475 --> 00:56:40.951
LAURA: Bearded ladies.

00:56:40.951 --> 00:56:42.450
SAM: What species?

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:49.386
MATT: The madam of the house introduces you to a
spectrum of ladies, mostly dwarven, and very

00:56:49.386 --> 00:56:56.701
attractive, you know. This is a nice
establishment. There is one gnome. One female

00:56:56.701 --> 00:57:01.944
gnome. There are a number of male dwarves as well,
that are standing at the ready. There is one elf,

00:57:01.944 --> 00:57:06.741
looks a little shy and embarrassed that a goliath
walked in.

00:57:09.171 --> 00:57:10.474
SAM: And that's our choice.

00:57:10.474 --> 00:57:12.052
MATT: Those are your choices.

00:57:12.052 --> 00:57:13.320
TRAVIS: I'll take the tallest one.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.852
SAM: I'll take a dwarf.

00:57:14.852 --> 00:57:23.890
MATT: Okay. You choose your lady, you take the
tallest one which would probably be the elf. As

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:29.387
you walk in, the shy elf turns around entirely.
She is aggressive and throws you around. You got

00:57:29.387 --> 00:57:35.876
your money's worth. You get manhandled in a way
that you haven't-- You're going to be sore in the morning.

00:57:35.923 --> 00:57:37.145
TRAVIS: Thank you!

00:57:37.145 --> 00:57:39.676
MATT: Welcome to Kraghammer, gentlemen.

00:57:39.676 --> 00:57:42.309
TRAVIS: I like it already.

00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:44.905
MATT: All right, you guys.

00:57:44.905 --> 00:57:45.411
LAURA: Yes.

00:57:45.411 --> 00:57:47.908
MATT: Are you just walking up to the manor?

00:57:47.908 --> 00:57:53.812
LAURA: No, we're going to try to check out what it
looks like. See what the guards are like.

00:57:54.093 --> 00:57:55.382
LIAM: Yeah, we'll pretend to take a stroll.

00:57:55.382 --> 00:57:55.978
LAURA: Yes.

00:57:55.978 --> 00:57:57.005
LIAM: Pose as a married couple.

00:57:57.005 --> 00:57:57.822
LAURA: Ew, no.

00:57:57.822 --> 00:58:00.945
LIAM: Just for the purposes of sneaking around the
house.

00:58:00.945 --> 00:58:01.882
LAURA: (retching)

00:58:01.882 --> 00:58:03.300
LIAM: I want to see what the area's like.

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.503
LAURA: How about we pose as brother and sister,
creepy?

00:58:05.503 --> 00:58:10.148
(laughter)

00:58:10.148 --> 00:58:17.046
LIAM: You come on to every human, orc, and
half-elf in the entire kingdom, but pretending to

00:58:17.046 --> 00:58:19.462
be my wife for 30 minutes is too much.

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:20.851
LAURA: Yes. It's disgusting, so no.

00:58:20.851 --> 00:58:22.218
LIAM: You're probably right.

00:58:22.218 --> 00:58:23.588
MATT: She's got standards.

00:58:23.588 --> 00:58:28.241
LIAM: Okay. So we'll take a stroll. Shop, see what
the area's like.

00:58:28.241 --> 00:58:31.691
MATT: You enter the residential district. It is
dark and you see the red stone that permeates the

00:58:31.752 --> 00:58:36.534
area for a low gentle glow of the entire city is
now clustered into these street lamps that are

00:58:36.534 --> 00:58:42.164
throughout the entire location. You begin to press
into the residential district proper. There's some

00:58:42.164 --> 00:58:45.375
nice homes that are carved into the side of the
rock, there's some stand-alone homes that are

00:58:45.375 --> 00:58:49.013
built out of fine stone. You eventually make your
way towards the nicer part of it, where you start

00:58:49.013 --> 00:58:53.811
seeing some of the more marble buildings, some of
the more exotic stonework being used in the

00:58:53.811 --> 00:59:00.527
construction of the homes. You also notice three
of the guards that are part of the city

00:59:00.527 --> 00:59:04.909
establishment there are following you from behind,
curiously. The Carvers.

00:59:04.909 --> 00:59:08.712
LAURA: Oh shit, the Carvers. Shit.

00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:11.263
MATT: No weapons drawn, but definitely hands at
the ready.

00:59:11.263 --> 00:59:12.825
LAURA and LIAM: Okay.

00:59:12.825 --> 00:59:14.796
LIAM: Well, we could just keep walking.

00:59:14.796 --> 00:59:16.399
LAURA: We could, but that could be bad.

00:59:16.399 --> 00:59:19.769
LIAM: Yes. No, we just want to look at the house.

00:59:19.769 --> 00:59:21.009
SAM: Louder!

00:59:21.009 --> 00:59:25.103
LIAM: I mean we're not going to go sneaking in in
the day.

00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:29.103
LAURA: Let's say which ones are very obvious about
being pretty, so we look like we're just sightseeing.

00:59:29.654 --> 00:59:30.386
LIAM: Yes.

00:59:30.386 --> 00:59:35.022
MATT: (chuckles darkly) As you continue to walk,
eventually some of the dwarves approach.

00:59:35.022 --> 00:59:38.681
LAURA: I point and say: Oh! Look at that one, with
the carving, it's amazing!

00:59:38.681 --> 00:59:40.441
LIAM: The architecture is divine.

00:59:40.441 --> 00:59:41.633
LAURA: Divine!

00:59:41.633 --> 00:59:45.388
SAM: (snorts) They're posing as the Howells?

00:59:45.388 --> 00:59:49.670
LIAM: Lovey, would you look at this dwarven home?

00:59:49.670 --> 01:00:00.212
MATT: (snobby voice) The marble texture on this is gorgeous.
You get about 20 more feet before you get, "Hail! Hail!"

01:00:00.795 --> 01:00:03.924
LAURA: Oh my! Yes? (giggles)

01:00:03.924 --> 01:00:07.758
MATT: "You foreigners are wandering too far in
districts you don't belong to. What's your business?"

01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:14.022
LAURA: Oh I'm so sorry, I was just so amazed by
the architecture here. I wanted to see the

01:00:14.022 --> 01:00:15.105
beautiful sculpture.

01:00:15.105 --> 01:00:21.303
LIAM: We definitely are visitors here, sir, no one
has explained the rules to your city. We were just

01:00:21.303 --> 01:00:26.372
taking in the fantastic architecture and history
of Kraghammer.

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:31.816
LAURA: We were told there was a beautiful
sculpture down the street of the ruler of Kraghammer?

01:00:31.831 --> 01:00:33.250
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.188
SAM: Oh jesus.

01:00:34.188 --> 01:00:35.084
TRAVIS: Oh god.

01:00:35.084 --> 01:00:36.530
MATT: Either of you, whichever you prefer.

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.003
SAM: If only I was there.

01:00:38.003 --> 01:00:39.077
LAURA: 21.

01:00:39.077 --> 01:00:40.197
MATT: All right.

01:00:40.197 --> 01:00:43.145
TRAVIS: Wow! Pretty decent, good for you.

01:00:43.145 --> 01:00:48.089
MATT: The guards look at each other. The one that
was talking to you, you can see now, as he comes a

01:00:48.089 --> 01:00:52.882
little closer into the light, a frazzled black
beard that's pulled into a very tight braid that

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:57.226
goes down to his bellybutton. All wearing the same
basic chest plate; long, black velvet cloak

01:00:57.226 --> 01:01:02.294
behind; each carrying some sort of heavy warhammer
around the side of their belt. Steps up and says,

01:01:02.294 --> 01:01:08.308
"Well, just to tell you the rules here, if you're
going to wander at night in a very expensive

01:01:08.308 --> 01:01:13.240
"district, you don't want to do it by yourself
because you either have chances of being mugged or

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.864
"arrested. We might have arrested you."

01:01:15.864 --> 01:01:21.694
LAURA: Oh no! I'm so sorry! Well, do we need
protection?

01:01:21.694 --> 01:01:26.692
MATT: One of them looks over and sees the bear
that is off in the shadows nearby.

01:01:26.692 --> 01:01:31.854
LAURA: I thought Trinket stayed behind. Cool,
cool!

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:37.169
MATT: Trinket's quietly trying to keep up with his
wonderful master.

01:01:37.169 --> 01:01:39.729
LIAM: Come along Trinket, there there's nothing to
be scared of.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:42.771
MATT: "What's a bear doing in Kraghammer?!" They
all grab out their warhammers.

01:01:42.771 --> 01:01:50.577
LAURA: Oh no, please, he's quite harmless. In
fact, he's very scared of most people.

01:01:50.577 --> 01:01:53.151
LIAM: He's completely trained. He does tricks.
Doesn't he do tricks?

01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:56.616
LAURA: He does. Trinket show them your wonderful
shake trick.

01:01:56.616 --> 01:02:06.120
MATT: At which point Trinket, (subdued growling)
just shakes his whole body. He looks at you, confused.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.690
LAURA: That's good.

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:11.858
MATT: Then raises a paw up, and-- (bear noises)

01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:15.127
LAURA: If you put your hand out, he'll shake your
hand.

01:02:15.127 --> 01:02:16.068
MATT: (growling)

01:02:16.068 --> 01:02:17.681
LAURA: Yeah, see!

01:02:17.681 --> 01:02:22.048
MATT: The dwarves take a step back as the claw
goes through the, "That's all right. I would say

01:02:22.048 --> 01:02:23.363
"if that's your animal--"

01:02:23.363 --> 01:02:24.044
LAURA: Yes?

01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:25.731
MATT: "--don't bring it here."

01:02:25.731 --> 01:02:35.317
LAURA: Oh, good to know. Trinket, head back to
that tavern, would you? People are getting nervous.

01:02:35.726 --> 01:02:37.052
MATT: (growling)

01:02:37.052 --> 01:02:37.898
LAURA: I love you.

01:02:37.898 --> 01:02:41.051
MATT: Trinket begins to walk back. A couple of
other dwarves that are wandering carrying some

01:02:41.051 --> 01:02:46.332
packages to the side make a very wide berth around
this armored bear that's slowly moping its way

01:02:46.332 --> 01:02:49.316
through the streets of Kraghammer. What could
possibly go wrong?

01:02:49.316 --> 01:02:50.296
LAURA: He's so cute.

01:02:50.296 --> 01:02:52.203
LIAM: He's a sweetheart, he's fine.

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:58.646
MATT: (growls) You hear in the distance. The one
goes like, "Look, I'll show you to the statue and

01:02:58.646 --> 01:03:00.243
"that's it, then you got to go."

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:01.885
LAURA: All right. Thank you.

01:03:01.885 --> 01:03:07.784
MATT: "I don't see many half-elves here and
honestly I'm excited to meet you, so let's do this

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:14.631
"quickly. Come with me." He leads you further into
the cityscape. Down the road, you end up going

01:03:14.631 --> 01:03:18.795
through a few buildings. You find one large
wrought iron fence with a series of carved spikes

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.291
towards the top, and you see the beautiful dark
marble building with the gold trim.

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:23.976
LAURA: Oh, this one's amazing.

01:03:23.976 --> 01:03:29.549
MATT: "This is what you were talking about,
Greyspine Manor. Lot of rich sons of bitches."

01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:35.543
LAURA: Wow, so you said the Greyspines own this
one?

01:03:35.543 --> 01:03:36.239
MATT: "Aye."

01:03:36.239 --> 01:03:40.923
LIAM: It's stunning. We only heard about the
building itself; what can you tell us about the

01:03:40.923 --> 01:03:42.559
people who live here?

01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:44.354
MATT: "Bunch of rich sons of bitches."

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.920
LAURA: Well, we can tell that can't we?

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.611
MATT: "Actually, Ironkeeper's all right, he's been
doing a great job. The rest of the family can suck off."

01:03:51.137 --> 01:03:51.878
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:03:51.878 --> 01:03:53.837
LIAM: Not liked by the rest of the city, then?

01:03:53.837 --> 01:03:57.156
MATT: "Oh, they have friends everywhere, but I
personally don't like them. They run business

01:03:57.156 --> 01:04:01.327
"pretty dark. They work most of their employees to
the ground. To the bone."

01:04:01.327 --> 01:04:02.214
LAURA: Oh no!

01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:04.716
MATT: "I don't think that's how you run a
business. Well, that's how you run a business for

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:05.667
"profit, but not for--"

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:11.044
LAURA: Wow. It sounds like they would run the
mithral mine which we've heard is so hard on its employees.

01:04:11.387 --> 01:04:12.160
MATT: "Aye, that's the one."

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.062
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:04:13.062 --> 01:04:16.979
MATT: "Yeah. I don't know, I don't go that far
south, doesn't interest me.

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:18.548
LIAM: Nor us.

01:04:18.548 --> 01:04:19.707
MATT: "Smells like brimstone."

01:04:19.707 --> 01:04:20.665
LAURA: I don't blame you.

01:04:20.665 --> 01:04:26.572
LIAM: We prefer the company of good hard working
people, like yourself. We're very impressed with

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:30.496
the work the Carvers do in this city, from what
little we've seen so far, so hats off to you.

01:04:30.496 --> 01:04:36.256
MATT: "I appreciate that. You know it's not easy.
You're born into it. We spend most of our time

01:04:36.256 --> 01:04:41.178
"training, which can get very boring." You see that
two of the dwarves that are now about two steps

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:47.579
behind go, "(clears throat) All right, Thompson!
We got to get back to our post!" "Oh, sorry. Look,

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:51.654
"we've dillied about too much. Just follow us back,
go about your business, don't wander here at

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.843
"night, and good luck."

01:04:53.843 --> 01:04:55.718
LAURA: Thank you so much.

01:04:55.718 --> 01:05:00.323
LIAM: Thank you. We follow for a couple of blocks,
behind them for a bit.

01:05:00.323 --> 01:05:02.473
LAURA: Make sure that they're paying attention to
us.

01:05:02.473 --> 01:05:03.064
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:05:03.064 --> 01:05:03.638
LIAM: Yes.

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:07.044
MATT: All right. They bring you back towards the
entrance of the residential district.

01:05:07.044 --> 01:05:08.520
LAURA: Then we stealth and--

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.278
LIAM: -- split off, yes, we can split off.

01:05:10.278 --> 01:05:12.421
MATT: All right, roll stealth, both of you guys.

01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:15.681
SAM: Am I currently being beaten by a whore dwarf
or anything?

01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:19.586
MATT: Make a constitution check!

01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:20.861
SAM: Constitution check?

01:05:20.861 --> 01:05:22.688
TRAVIS: Hang strong, buddy!

01:05:22.688 --> 01:05:24.590
ORION: That's a mouthful. 'Whore dwarf.'

01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:25.285
SAM: 18!

01:05:25.285 --> 01:05:28.033
MATT: Plus your constitution modifier. Actually,
athletics! Go athletics!

01:05:28.033 --> 01:05:29.774
SAM: Plus two! 20.

01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:35.387
MATT: All right, that's a fine constitution check.
You have impressed your female dwarf.

01:05:35.387 --> 01:05:37.368
LIAM: Are you making a sex check?

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.174
SAM: Yes! I'm sex checking.

01:05:39.174 --> 01:05:40.935
TALIESIN: Whore dwarf!

01:05:40.935 --> 01:05:43.311
MATT: That happened. That's the first time.

01:05:45.051 --> 01:05:47.254
SAM: (grunting)

01:05:47.254 --> 01:05:49.948
LAURA: This is so uncomfortable.

01:05:51.143 --> 01:05:54.539
MATT: So that happened. What'd you guys roll for
stealth?

01:05:54.539 --> 01:05:55.755
LIAM: 20.

01:05:55.755 --> 01:05:57.409
LAURA: He rolled a 20, I rolled a 15.

01:05:57.409 --> 01:05:59.049
TRAVIS: That's okay!

01:05:59.049 --> 01:06:03.594
MATT: As you guys begin to wander off--

01:06:03.594 --> 01:06:05.581
LAURA: No! They're professional Carvers.

01:06:05.581 --> 01:06:12.469
MATT: -- Vax, you vanish. Vex, you take a couple
steps. You hear, "Hey, hey, hey! I told you, it's

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.894
"dangerous down there in the dark! Don't do that!"

01:06:14.894 --> 01:06:15.727
LAURA: Of course!

01:06:15.727 --> 01:06:16.931
MATT: "Where's your friend?"

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:21.090
LAURA: Oh, he already went back to the tavern that
we're staying at. I was wondering if maybe you

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:23.305
could show me around the rest of the town?

01:06:23.305 --> 01:06:28.835
MATT: He looks to the other guards and they're
obviously fed up with his flirting, and they're

01:06:28.835 --> 01:06:35.210
not too keen on you guys. "Well, you guys hold up
post, I'll give her a quick walk around."

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:37.252
LAURA: Thank you so much.

01:06:37.252 --> 01:06:40.957
MATT: "All right, but I'm going to tell the boss!"
"Fine! I don't get this chance very often!"

01:06:43.045 --> 01:06:45.341
LIAM: I wave off from the alley that I snuck in
to.

01:06:45.341 --> 01:06:46.989
LAURA: Yeah, go do your shit.

01:06:46.989 --> 01:06:52.876
LIAM: You do your shit, that you do! Then I head
back through the shadows.

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:56.892
LAURA: Whoosh! Damn it!

01:06:56.892 --> 01:07:01.523
MATT: You ask around, and it takes a while,
especially since as a dragonborn some folks are

01:07:01.523 --> 01:07:06.333
like, "Oh, I'm not talking to you!" Some others
are like, "Oh, yeah, right over that way!" It's a

01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:10.626
completely wrong direction, so it takes you a good
two hours to eventually find your way to House

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:17.172
Thunderbrand. When you get there, it's a beautiful
alabaster building: large, white dome, with small

01:07:17.172 --> 01:07:24.503
spires built in to one of the more elevated
ceilings of Kraghammer proper. On the outside,

01:07:24.503 --> 01:07:33.484
there is no gate, just an open lawn. You see
grass, you see normally outside flora and fauna

01:07:33.484 --> 01:07:36.336
currently adorning the scape around this
structure.

01:07:36.336 --> 01:07:43.155
ORION: Whoa. Well, this is a lovely sight! I'm
going to saunter on up to the door!

01:07:43.155 --> 01:07:45.419
MATT: Nice! Go ahead and make a perception check.

01:07:45.419 --> 01:07:53.511
ORION: Where is my perception--? Oh. Five.

01:07:53.511 --> 01:08:01.665
MATT: Five? You saunter right up to the edge of
the grass line, and get one step on what suddenly

01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:09.721
becomes visible to you: a rather subtly carved
dwarven rune in the ground. In fact, there's a

01:08:09.721 --> 01:08:13.302
bunch of them, outlining the entirety of the
grass. As your foot hits the rune, you're like,

01:08:13.302 --> 01:08:15.823
"Oh, that's a dwarven rune!" (stomping)

01:08:15.823 --> 01:08:16.894
SAM: That's a good voice!

01:08:16.894 --> 01:08:20.041
MATT: (as Tiberius) I've been practicing my
Tiberius.

01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:21.827
ORION: It's close.

01:08:21.827 --> 01:08:26.838
MATT: Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw.

01:08:26.838 --> 01:08:29.721
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. Saving throw?

01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:31.315
LAURA: You got it, Tiberius!

01:08:31.315 --> 01:08:32.508
ORION: What is this?

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:33.365
MARISHA: Dexterity.

01:08:33.365 --> 01:08:36.797
ORION: Oh! That's a 15.

01:08:37.137 --> 01:08:37.862
MATT: 15?

01:08:37.862 --> 01:08:38.582
ORION: Mm-hmm.

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:47.119
MATT: You manage to pull back to lessen the
impact, but a bolt of bluish energy bursts out

01:08:47.373 --> 01:08:51.055
from the rune in front of you, throwing you about
three or four feet behind the rune. You catch

01:08:51.055 --> 01:08:53.716
yourself. You do suffer eight points of thunder
damage.

01:08:53.716 --> 01:08:54.513
ORION: Okay.

01:08:54.513 --> 01:08:56.443
MARISHA: Damn gated communities.

01:08:56.443 --> 01:09:02.732
SAM: This is why we go to brothels instead of
sneaking around at night!

01:09:02.732 --> 01:09:04.222
TRAVIS: Yep! No lightning attacks!

01:09:04.222 --> 01:09:06.000
MATT: It's a whole different kind of damage you
can suffer!

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:16.637
ORION: Okay. Well, I dust myself off. Apparently,
there's some security. Hello?! Anything happen?

01:09:16.637 --> 01:09:18.840
MATT: You wait about two or three minutes, no
response.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.803
ORION: Two to three minutes? That's a long time.

01:09:21.803 --> 01:09:22.349
MATT: Yeah.

01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:25.947
MARISHA: I have a feeling they're not going to
respond to the crazy guy.

01:09:25.947 --> 01:09:27.945
ORION: Very well.

01:09:27.945 --> 01:09:30.006
TRAVIS: What're you two doing?

01:09:30.006 --> 01:09:34.080
TALIESIN and MARISHA: We're making comment cards!
Yes!

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.725
TALIESIN: You're all going to have comment cards
that you are expected to fill out when you return

01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:38.980
back to the bar!

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.069
SAM: Hugely important!

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:43.112
MARISHA: Yes, because-- what was it? Baldus,
Beldus?

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:44.068
SAM: Balgus?

01:09:44.068 --> 01:09:46.042
MARISHA: Balan! Balan was so nice!

01:09:46.042 --> 01:09:49.803
MATT: There we go. Balgus and Balan.

01:09:49.803 --> 01:09:59.585
ORION: What do I see around the place? Do I see
any large rocks, or any large pillars that I can--?

01:10:01.389 --> 01:10:05.425
MATT: Best from what you can tell at this
distance, because it's fairly dark down here: the

01:10:05.425 --> 01:10:10.355
building itself has four corner spires around the
large central dome structure. Each one of these

01:10:10.355 --> 01:10:15.719
spires is a very thin, tall, alabaster spire that
at the very top is crested with some sort of

01:10:15.719 --> 01:10:22.332
bluish crystal that comes to a point. They're
probably a good 35, 40 feet tall. About as tall as

01:10:22.332 --> 01:10:26.196
the rest of the structure is. You can't really
tell how far back the structure goes because it

01:10:26.196 --> 01:10:27.894
meets with the back of the cave wall.

01:10:27.894 --> 01:10:42.738
ORION: I'm going to-- okay. I'm going to shoot a
Fireball. Right in front of me, roll it like a

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:45.135
bowling ball. Just right to the door.

01:10:45.135 --> 01:10:45.788
MATT: Okay.

01:10:45.788 --> 01:10:47.411
SAM: There's a baby right there.

01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:49.400
MATT: You are four feet from the door.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.877
ORION: Oh! I'm four feet from the door? I don't do
that.

01:10:51.877 --> 01:10:54.363
MATT: You can step back and do it.

01:10:54.363 --> 01:10:56.032
ORION: I'm only four feet from the door? Oh.

01:10:56.032 --> 01:10:59.515
MATT: It pushed you back four feet from the rune
you stepped on. You're not at the door.

01:11:00.105 --> 01:11:02.531
LAURA: Can I use that magical earring that we
have?

01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:03.731
LIAM: You don't know what's going on there!

01:11:03.731 --> 01:11:05.727
SAM: Episode one. Tiberius kills himself.

01:11:05.727 --> 01:11:11.452
MARISHA: Don't die! I should have come with you!
Then I could--

01:11:11.452 --> 01:11:12.782
TRAVIS: Bowl that Fireball, dude!

01:11:12.782 --> 01:11:18.004
MATT: Tiberius Stormwind is a dragonborn sorcerer.
Everyone is level nine currently in the game.

01:11:18.004 --> 01:11:22.815
ORION: I use Mage Hand. I knock on the door.

01:11:22.815 --> 01:11:31.565
MATT: From that far away? Okay, the arcane energy
swirls up and forms this loosely hand-like

01:11:31.565 --> 01:11:36.117
appendage that drifts forward. As soon as it
crosses over the rune where you stepped on, there

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:38.534
is a spark of energy and the hand is dispelled.

01:11:38.534 --> 01:11:45.915
ORION: Damn these runes. Okay, fine. I will do
Glacial Blast right up to the door.

01:11:45.915 --> 01:11:46.705
MATT: Okay.

01:11:46.705 --> 01:11:48.070
ORION: But not to the door.

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.956
MARISHA: What?

01:11:48.956 --> 01:11:50.275
SAM: You're alone.

01:11:50.275 --> 01:11:55.306
MATT: Okay. You cast the Glacial Blast forward.
The ice begins to congeal across the bottom of the floor.

01:11:55.631 --> 01:11:59.771
As it reaches the front of the rune, there is
another spark of energy and the ice forms up

01:11:59.771 --> 01:12:03.861
against an invisible barrier that's there and then
the ice that's up against the barrier melts

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.355
extremely quickly, drifting into a puddle of
water.

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:10.665
ORION: Shit. I turn back and head to the group.

01:12:10.665 --> 01:12:16.786
MATT: Okay. As you turn around there are four
Carvers that are hurrying towards you now, with

01:12:16.786 --> 01:12:19.717
their hammers out going, "You!"

01:12:19.717 --> 01:12:20.355
ORION: What?!

01:12:20.355 --> 01:12:25.657
MATT: They all surround you on all sides, you have
a dwarf on each corner. "You have attacked one of

01:12:25.657 --> 01:12:30.697
"the great dwarven families of Kraghammer! Name
yourself and your business before you are under arrest."

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:33.932
ORION: Don't speak to me in that manner, I am
Tiberius Stormwind!

01:12:33.932 --> 01:12:36.174
SAM: I am snoring after having sex.

01:12:36.174 --> 01:12:39.014
MATT: Make intimidation check.

01:12:39.014 --> 01:12:43.167
ORION: 18.

01:12:43.167 --> 01:12:54.451
MATT: All four Carvers take a step back, look at
each other. "Look, we're just doing our job.

01:12:54.451 --> 01:12:55.999
"What's your business?"

01:12:55.999 --> 01:13:01.597
ORION: I understand that, and I am sorry for
losing my temper. I was just looking to ask

01:13:01.597 --> 01:13:05.659
questions of particular artifacts I have been
looking for and this house is the only known

01:13:05.659 --> 01:13:11.258
arcane house I know that I was pointed to. I tried
to reach them and communicate, but I was stopped

01:13:11.258 --> 01:13:16.007
by the stupid rune I can't figure out! I was
turning back to get my tavern to get some rest and

01:13:16.007 --> 01:13:20.689
come back and try to contact the family the next
day! Then I was stopped by you!

01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:22.982
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:27.257
ORION: 24.

01:13:27.257 --> 01:13:31.472
LIAM: I've just arrived to New York City, I'm
going to smash the doors open.

01:13:31.472 --> 01:13:38.840
MATT: The dwarf guards look at each other and one
of them steps forward and this guy you can see now

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.449
he has more carvings in his armor, he looks to
have a little more rank than the other ones. He

01:13:42.449 --> 01:13:47.751
steps forward, ruddy brown beard, his eyes itself
are pitch black. There is almost no color to the

01:13:47.751 --> 01:13:54.398
irises. He goes, "Look. I'm letting you off this
once, but if you so much as spit in the direction

01:13:54.398 --> 01:14:00.062
"of any other dwarf in the city, we're going to
bury you so far underneath the dungeon you won't

01:14:00.062 --> 01:14:03.206
"see the light of day 'til the day you rot, you
hear me, dragonborn?"

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:05.453
ORION: I mean yes, my hearing is perfectly fine.

01:14:05.453 --> 01:14:12.699
MATT: "Get on with you." He puts his hammer back
at his side. They all separate, stare you down as

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:13.594
you walk past.

01:14:13.594 --> 01:14:19.159
ORION: Good day. Back to the tavern.

01:14:19.159 --> 01:14:21.246
MATT: Okay. You!

01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:21.983
LIAM: Yes?

01:14:21.983 --> 01:14:26.576
MATT: You make your way through the alleyways,
eventually back towards the building proper. What

01:14:26.576 --> 01:14:27.546
would you like to do?

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:33.195
LIAM: Just going to watch, that's all. Do I see
any security details? See who's guarding the place.

01:14:33.195 --> 01:14:38.604
MATT: There are Carvers doing rounds around the
city. On the streets wandering through in pairs,

01:14:39.113 --> 01:14:45.493
keeping watch. You don't see any particular guard
outside, but you do see individuals moving past

01:14:45.493 --> 01:14:48.211
windows. There's a little bit of light from the
inside of the buildings.

01:14:48.211 --> 01:14:52.509
LIAM: No Carvers or any sort of guard detail
outside the house? Anything like that?

01:14:52.509 --> 01:14:56.246
MATT: Not between the gates. The yard area and to
the front door.

01:14:56.246 --> 01:15:01.105
LIAM: Okay. Heavily heavily guarded by the looks
of what's inside and what's outside the gate?

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:05.842
MATT: What's outside the gate? You're hard pressed
to find a moment where the street isn't visible to

01:15:05.842 --> 01:15:10.189
some Carver. This area is pretty well guarded. You
figure largely because the person who is currently

01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:14.282
the Ironkeeper of the entire city of Kraghammer
lives within that building as well as one of the

01:15:14.282 --> 01:15:17.993
more powerful dwarven families,
so it's pretty well watched.

01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:21.460
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to head back to the inn,
then. I'm not going to poke the bear.

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.790
MATT: You all eventually gather back at the
tavern.

01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:26.817
SAM: (exhausted sigh) How was your night?

01:15:26.817 --> 01:15:29.190
TRAVIS: That was wonderful, I don't know about
you!

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:30.915
SAM: (singsong) I have hickies.

01:15:30.915 --> 01:15:34.504
(laughter)

01:15:34.504 --> 01:15:37.214
LIAM: Hickies? Is that a Gnomish STD?

01:15:37.214 --> 01:15:39.111
SAM: Yes.

01:15:39.111 --> 01:15:46.797
LAURA: Crazy! I have some hickies too, actually.
What?

01:15:46.797 --> 01:15:47.455
SAM: What?

01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:50.093
TALIESIN: We have comment cards, so this will all
work out well.

01:15:50.093 --> 01:15:52.175
MARISHA: Yes! here! Here you go, here you go--

01:15:52.175 --> 01:15:54.234
SAM: Success all around! Did you learn anything,
Vex and Vax?

01:15:54.234 --> 01:15:59.971
LIAM: I definitely think we should take the
diplomacy route. The place is heavily guarded.

01:15:59.971 --> 01:16:01.723
There seem to be lots of Carvers.

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:06.651
MATT: There's a knock at the room that you guys
are currently talking in.

01:16:06.651 --> 01:16:07.267
LAURA: Yes?

01:16:07.267 --> 01:16:09.442
MATT: Unless, are you in the tavern proper or have
you gone back to-- ?

01:16:09.442 --> 01:16:10.398
LAURA: No, we're in a room.

01:16:10.398 --> 01:16:14.856
SAM: I'll get it! (clears throat) Hello?

01:16:14.856 --> 01:16:20.002
MATT: Adra's standing there looking a little
nervous and she goes, "Hi, sorry to bother you. Is

01:16:20.002 --> 01:16:22.059
"that bear one of yours?"

01:16:22.059 --> 01:16:22.609
SAM: Oh!

01:16:22.609 --> 01:16:27.209
LAURA: Yes! Trinket! Isn't he adorable?

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:32.580
MATT: "You might want to go," You hear in the
tavern: (aggravated growls)

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.982
LAURA: I'll be right back. I head downstairs.

01:16:34.982 --> 01:16:38.110
MATT: You head downstairs and you can see all the
dwarves are now gathered around the fighting ring

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.286
in the center of the tavern.

01:16:39.286 --> 01:16:39.957
LAURA: Oh no!

01:16:39.957 --> 01:16:44.744
MATT: Trinket's now inside the ring with a couple
other dwarves around, prodding and pushing it into

01:16:44.744 --> 01:16:45.458
the ring.

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:47.576
LAURA: No, no! No! <i>No.</i>

01:16:47.576 --> 01:16:52.164
MATT: There's raucous cheering. They're not even
listening to you at this point.

01:16:52.164 --> 01:16:53.262
LAURA: Grog!

01:16:53.262 --> 01:16:54.861
LIAM: I followed my sister downstairs.

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:56.394
TRAVIS: I come down too. It's party time!

01:16:56.394 --> 01:16:58.487
MARISHA: I run down to with Grog.

01:16:58.487 --> 01:17:06.625
MATT: Okay, as you guys head down, you can see now
Balgus is now up and rubbing his chin. "Oh, never

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:07.875
"fought a bear before! (laughs)"

01:17:07.875 --> 01:17:12.173
LAURA: No, Balgus! Fuck! Trinket, come here! Are
we allowed to cuss? Trinket, come here!

01:17:12.659 --> 01:17:13.479
MATT: You are very much allowed to cuss.

01:17:13.479 --> 01:17:14.199
LAURA: Okay.

01:17:14.199 --> 01:17:15.622
MATT: Isn't that right, guys? Fuck yeah!

01:17:15.622 --> 01:17:20.807
LAURA: No, no, and I run into the ring with him.

01:17:20.807 --> 01:17:25.497
MATT: Okay, as you run into the ring a couple of
the dwarves pat you on the back, you get a shove

01:17:25.497 --> 01:17:27.714
into the ring. It's now Trinket and you--

01:17:27.714 --> 01:17:31.935
LAURA: Oh! I'll take on this bear!

01:17:31.935 --> 01:17:36.611
(laughter)

01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:38.484
SAM: What?!

01:17:38.484 --> 01:17:39.413
TALIESIN: Well, all right!

01:17:39.413 --> 01:17:40.638
MATT: Make a general charisma check.

01:17:40.638 --> 01:17:42.563
TRAVIS: Do it! Fuck that bear up!

01:17:42.563 --> 01:17:44.835
LIAM: I'm pushing my way through the crowd.

01:17:44.835 --> 01:17:45.977
LAURA: Oh no!

01:17:45.977 --> 01:17:46.997
MATT: What did you roll?

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:48.221
LIAM: A one.

01:17:48.221 --> 01:17:49.428
MARISHA: Oh no!

01:17:49.428 --> 01:17:51.835
MATT: Yes!

01:17:51.835 --> 01:17:54.546
LIAM: First one of the series, everybody! First
one!

01:17:54.546 --> 01:18:00.785
MATT: As you rush and you guys are coming to the
front, Balgus sees this and now you can see

01:18:00.785 --> 01:18:07.246
both eyes are open which means he's sobered up a
bit, and he goes, "Oh no! This bear's mine. You

01:18:07.246 --> 01:18:10.109
"want to fight two of us? Oh, it'll wake you right
up!"

01:18:10.109 --> 01:18:11.042
LAURA: Let's do it!

01:18:11.042 --> 01:18:12.607
MATT: "Nothing as invigorating as as a brawl!"

01:18:12.607 --> 01:18:14.298
SAM: Are you going to fucking fight him?

01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:17.924
MARISHA: I cast a fog. Over the ring.

01:18:17.924 --> 01:18:24.665
MATT: Okay. As everyone is cheering up and getting
ready, this very thick fog begins to fill the

01:18:25.254 --> 01:18:30.112
center of the bar area. You can now see a bunch of
people are, "Wait, what the?!" Some are coughing.

01:18:30.112 --> 01:18:34.177
Some are like, "What the hell's going on? Fucking
hell. Why is there--"

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:38.821
MARISHA: Okay, I run up in the fog, and I tap
Trinket and I whisper in Trinket's ear and I say:

01:18:38.821 --> 01:18:43.019
Trinket, I'm tapping you out. And I turn into a
bear like Trinket!

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:43.622
SAM: What?!

01:18:43.622 --> 01:18:44.328
TRAVIS: Good!

01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:45.161
MATT: Okay.

01:18:45.161 --> 01:18:49.559
MARISHA: Wait. First, I Polymorph Trinket into a
squirrel.

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:51.182
LAURA: (gasp) You can do that?

01:18:51.182 --> 01:18:55.703
MARISHA: I can. No, a mouse, like a rat.

01:18:55.703 --> 01:18:56.694
LAURA: Little tiny.

01:18:56.694 --> 01:19:02.853
MATT: Okay. You see the shadows nearby the fog you
hear, "Come at me, I'm going to--" You can see

01:19:02.853 --> 01:19:05.376
Balgus's shadow swinging wildly at the air,
angrily.

01:19:05.376 --> 01:19:06.514
SAM: Are you going to fight him?

01:19:06.514 --> 01:19:07.418
LAURA: I don't know!

01:19:07.418 --> 01:19:11.021
MATT: You grab Trinket. Trinket shrinks down into
a tiny little mouse.

01:19:11.021 --> 01:19:15.078
MARISHA: I say: Scanlan! Catch Trinket!

01:19:15.078 --> 01:19:18.234
SAM: Jesus, I don't like rats, but I'll keep it.
Okay.

01:19:18.234 --> 01:19:25.035
MATT: Trinket, the little mouse face, the moment
you see it, looks very confused, very scared.

01:19:25.035 --> 01:19:27.611
SAM: It's okay. I'll protect it. Don't worry.

01:19:27.611 --> 01:19:28.994
MARISHA: Then I bear form up.

01:19:28.994 --> 01:19:33.613
MATT: You (whoosh) into a bear form. Now Keyleth
is now this giant bear where Trinket once was.

01:19:33.613 --> 01:19:35.167
TRAVIS: I got my money on Ballsack!

01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:38.729
SAM: Don't bet against the enemy!

01:19:38.729 --> 01:19:43.463
LIAM: In the fog I somersault over some random
dwarf and pull out my dagger, but turn it around

01:19:43.463 --> 01:19:48.395
in my hand and whack Balgus in the back of the
head as hard as I can, just to try and knock him out.

01:19:48.395 --> 01:19:49.783
LAURA: Can you see in fog?

01:19:49.783 --> 01:19:51.406
SAM: He's a really good fighter.

01:19:51.406 --> 01:19:52.108
LIAM: Low light.

01:19:52.108 --> 01:19:53.142
MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check.

01:19:53.142 --> 01:19:53.654
LAURA: What?!

01:19:53.654 --> 01:19:56.032
MATT: You have advantage because you are in fog.

01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:59.086
ORION: I'm at the balcony by the way. Watching all
this.

01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:00.838
LAURA: You have advantage, roll twice.

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:01.517
LIAM: Oh, thank you.

01:20:01.517 --> 01:20:03.195
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're watching what they're doing.

01:20:03.195 --> 01:20:06.131
SAM: Remember, he's our friend. We don't want to
kill him.

01:20:06.131 --> 01:20:08.475
ORION: I'm taking a short rest, you all can do
this.

01:20:08.475 --> 01:20:09.208
LIAM: 21.

01:20:09.687 --> 01:20:12.818
MATT: Okay. Balgus's drunken, mist covered state
does not seem to notice your approach. He is

01:20:13.214 --> 01:20:17.496
swinging wildly, though. He has disadvantaged
attack on you as you approach. One of his fists

01:20:17.496 --> 01:20:24.131
swings past you. That is going to be a 12, I don't
think that hits.

01:20:24.131 --> 01:20:24.524
LIAM: No.

01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:28.411
MATT: You just narrowly dodge out of the way. You
can feel the fist just whoosh past one of your

01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:33.360
ears. As you come back up, clutching the base of
your dagger, go for your strike.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.636
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

01:20:34.636 --> 01:20:36.658
TRAVIS: Come on taint butter, you got it.

01:20:36.658 --> 01:20:42.864
LIAM: Oh, that's no good. Oh, I have advantage on
the attack roll for this?

01:20:42.864 --> 01:20:46.059
MATT: Because he does not see you, yes. You are
currently stealthed.

01:20:46.059 --> 01:20:48.392
LIAM: That's much better. 26!

01:20:48.392 --> 01:20:50.146
TRAVIS: That'll work.

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:54.509
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll sneak attack
damage on this, of course.

01:20:54.509 --> 01:20:55.597
LIAM: Plus regular?

01:20:55.597 --> 01:20:56.202
MATT: Yeah.

01:20:56.202 --> 01:20:56.795
SAM: Don't kill him!

01:20:56.795 --> 01:21:01.600
MATT: Well, we're considering it nonlethal damage
because it's with the base of the dagger.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.583
ORION: I'm having an ale while watching all this.

01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:06.979
MATT: You're watching a lot of fog, with some
shapes moving in it.

01:21:06.979 --> 01:21:10.694
ORION: Yeah, and I'm like: This is fog! Probably
Keyleth's spell.

01:21:10.694 --> 01:21:12.168
LAURA: I'm blindly looking for Trinket.

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:13.378
SAM: Trinket's in my hands.

01:21:13.378 --> 01:21:16.083
MATT: You're like, "Where's Trinket?" You see a
giant bear there and you're like, "There's

01:21:16.083 --> 01:21:19.407
"Trinket! That's not Trinket. There's no armor."

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.045
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

01:21:21.045 --> 01:21:24.100
MATT: You're very confused. Trinket now has no
armor, is a slightly different shade--

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.818
MARISHA: No, he's close enough! Man, come on, I've
been around Trinket enough.

01:21:27.818 --> 01:21:30.069
ORION and MARISHA: Come on, man!

01:21:30.069 --> 01:21:31.960
LIAM: 27, right in the base of his skull.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.770
SAM: Jesus.

01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:37.990
MATT: Crack! A resounding impact hits and there
now dwarves that are like, "Yeah! Ooh!" All the

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:44.310
cheering stops and there's this lull. Quiet hits.
Balgus hasn't moved, by the way. You impact and

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:50.772
it's like hitting a wall. There's this taut,
thick stump of muscle where the dwarf neck is.

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:51.578
LIAM: Fuck!

01:21:51.578 --> 01:21:57.091
MATT: As you pull back the dagger, his hand
reaches up and grabs your wrist. His head slowly

01:21:57.091 --> 01:22:01.846
turns towards you and he goes, (laughs)

01:22:01.846 --> 01:22:05.765
LIAM: Bonus action to disengage. Disengage as a
rogue.

01:22:05.765 --> 01:22:06.906
MATT: Well he's going to attempt to grapple you.

01:22:06.906 --> 01:22:08.839
LAURA and LIAM: Oh no.

01:22:08.839 --> 01:22:14.251
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check; it's
probably your best score anyway.

01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:16.626
LIAM: All right. Oh, that's fine! That's a 30.

01:22:16.626 --> 01:22:17.470
MATT: That's a 30?

01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:18.011
LIAM: Yeah.

01:22:18.011 --> 01:22:22.417
MATT: You manage to just slip out of his grip.
Barely. He was about to clamp on. As you step

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:28.822
away, he turns towards you and goes, "Oh, well I
feel alive tonight! Bring it, all of you! I want

01:22:28.822 --> 01:22:33.385
"to smash a face in." He's got a little bit of ale
froth at the corner of his mouth. It's beginning

01:22:33.385 --> 01:22:36.711
to drip into his beard. It's quite an awful sight
for those that are close enough to see it. The

01:22:36.711 --> 01:22:41.570
rest of you just see this, shapes and movement.
There's still this, "Okay, what's going on?" kind

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:46.583
of a feel. You hear Adra in the back going, "Stop
this! This is-- I can't even see! What are you

01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:50.980
doing?! Don't destroy another table!" She's
frantically trying to stop this chaos. There's now

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.220
a bear-- what are you doing, Keyleth?

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.369
MARISHA: I'm a bear and--

01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:57.053
MATT: You're a bear.

01:22:57.053 --> 01:22:58.112
ORION: (like Marisha) I'm a bear.

01:22:58.112 --> 01:22:59.434
MARISHA: What happened?

01:22:59.434 --> 01:23:01.376
MATT: You're a bear, you want to do anything?

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:02.187
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:23:02.187 --> 01:23:05.261
MATT: You see the shape of Balgus like-- in the
middle of this fight ring.

01:23:05.261 --> 01:23:09.728
LAURA: Do some tricks! Do some tricks! Start
clapping and, like, dancing around.

01:23:09.728 --> 01:23:11.217
MARISHA: Okay, that's a good idea.

01:23:11.217 --> 01:23:12.568
MATT: This is what she tells you.

01:23:12.568 --> 01:23:15.972
MARISHA: I see her as my trainer.

01:23:15.972 --> 01:23:17.587
LAURA: Dance!

01:23:17.587 --> 01:23:20.909
MARISHA: I'm like (growling). I'm circus
bear-ing.

01:23:20.909 --> 01:23:24.822
LAURA: Everyone! Gather round and watch the
amazing Trinket do his tricks!

01:23:24.822 --> 01:23:30.950
SAM: I start playing music from my shawm
instrument. Which exists.

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:32.451
MATT: Yeah, it does.

01:23:32.451 --> 01:23:36.259
SAM: A rousing jaunty bear-like tune.

01:23:36.259 --> 01:23:36.846
LAURA: Yes!

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:39.679
ORION: I'm going to cast Prestidigitation and do
fireworks on top of that.

01:23:39.679 --> 01:23:43.945
MARISHA: You should give me a fez! Can you
Prestidigitation me a fez?

01:23:43.945 --> 01:23:44.974
ORION: Can I do little hats?

01:23:44.974 --> 01:23:47.455
MATT: You haven't done a fez yet. You need to work
on that. A couple more levels.

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:49.400
ORION: No. I'll try. Paper hat!

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.452
MATT: Have you ever seen fireworks go off in a
cloud? You get that little boof, boof. There's a

01:23:53.452 --> 01:23:58.151
bunch of that above you. Cloud, lights flashing.
You begin singing your tune. Do you give an

01:23:58.151 --> 01:23:59.459
inspiration dice to her?

01:23:59.459 --> 01:24:01.276
SAM: Sure, I would love to give her an inspiration
dice.

01:24:01.276 --> 01:24:07.170
MATT: A d8 inspiration dice from the bard as you
hear the enchanting, jaunty, bear dancing theme.

01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:10.922
SAM: (singing) Oh, look over there! It's a bear!
Yeah!

01:24:11.545 --> 01:24:14.326
MATT: Bard getting his bard on. 
Go ahead and make a performance check.

01:24:14.326 --> 01:24:15.183
SAM: Who, me?

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:18.722
MATT: No, she does. You're performing as a bear!

01:24:18.722 --> 01:24:20.201
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:24:20.201 --> 01:24:24.505
(cheering)

01:24:24.505 --> 01:24:26.124
MATT: Do you want to add performance dice?

01:24:26.124 --> 01:24:28.372
LIAM: Look at that, a fucking bear dance.

01:24:28.372 --> 01:24:30.138
MATT: I'm sorry, the inspiration dice that he gave
you.

01:24:30.138 --> 01:24:31.054
SAM: No! It's a natural 20!

01:24:31.054 --> 01:24:31.658
MARISHA: It's a natural 20!

01:24:31.658 --> 01:24:33.297
MATT: I know. Okay!

01:24:33.297 --> 01:24:37.784
MARISHA: No, I want to save it! I'm inspired, for
later. I will think back to that moment.

01:24:37.784 --> 01:24:39.950
MATT: You were so inspired, you weren't even
inspired to be inspired for this.

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:40.593
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:24:40.593 --> 01:24:47.431
MATT: This array of strange puffy fireworks in the
fog; you doing this little rotation. You actually

01:24:47.431 --> 01:24:51.397
manage to do a bear cartwheel, and slam into the
ring, but it looks pretty cool. You get back up.

01:24:51.397 --> 01:25:00.813
You're on your hind legs, you dance on one foot
for a second. Balgus is like, (raucous laughter).

01:25:00.813 --> 01:25:05.062
He starts laughing, doubles over, clutching his
stomach, laughing his ass off. Other dwarves start

01:25:05.062 --> 01:25:09.790
laughing too. The music gets louder and the band
in the back of the tavern begins playing again.

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:13.225
There's now this general jovial air restored to
the tavern.

01:25:13.225 --> 01:25:19.339
LAURA: I grab an empty cup off of the table and
say: Tips for the bear, right here!

01:25:19.339 --> 01:25:21.083
SAM: We're going to get money for this?

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:22.490
TRAVIS: Of course.

01:25:22.906 --> 01:25:27.764
LIAM: I beeline to the bar and say: A large mug of
ale, please. As soon as it's ready, bring it right

01:25:27.764 --> 01:25:30.455
over to Balgus.

01:25:30.455 --> 01:25:34.208
MATT: You guys are pulling through a crowd,
covered in mist still. You're having a hard time

01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:37.409
finding your way through the bar. The people are
at least now cheering, in the mood. There's still

01:25:37.409 --> 01:25:39.861
some people trying to find their way to the front
to see what's going because they hear the music

01:25:39.861 --> 01:25:43.008
and they hear the cheering. "Well, what's going on
over there?" They're pushing their way through.

01:25:43.008 --> 01:25:48.380
You make your way to the bar. You see Adra's
really nervous, like, (panicked sounds)

01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:49.923
LIAM: I can fix this!

01:25:49.923 --> 01:25:51.050
MATT: "How? Do! Go!"

01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.587
LIAM: Quickly?

01:25:51.587 --> 01:25:53.701
MATT: "Here, go!" She hands you one, doesn't even
charge you for it.

01:25:53.701 --> 01:25:55.496
MARISHA: I'm still dancing!

01:25:55.496 --> 01:25:57.868
LIAM: Looking for Balgus in the crowd.

01:25:57.868 --> 01:26:01.956
MATT: He's still in the center of the ring. No
one's still getting near Balgus. They're cheering

01:26:01.956 --> 01:26:07.600
off to the side. Balgus is laughing. "Ooh, growl
for me! Do a happy growl!"

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.586
MARISHA: (growls)

01:26:11.153 --> 01:26:19.894
MATT: "Yeah, there's a happy growl! Oh, it's been
so long since I've been outside!" A little tear on

01:26:19.894 --> 01:26:23.555
the edge of his face. As you approach up his
side--

01:26:23.555 --> 01:26:24.766
LIAM: Arm around his shoulder.

01:26:24.766 --> 01:26:28.262
MATT: Immediately, instinctively, he slaps it off
his arm and turns around.

01:26:28.262 --> 01:26:35.924
LIAM: Take this! You are an impressive specimen,
my good man. I have never had a fight that amazing

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:42.728
in at least a week. That was something to see.
Here, take this, and after this one there's three more.

01:26:42.756 --> 01:26:47.197
MATT: He's drunk, you're offering him ale, and
he's been laughing at a bear for two minutes. Make

01:26:47.197 --> 01:26:48.303
a persuasion roll with advantage.

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:51.825
LIAM: Yeah! Persuasion, you say? 15.

01:26:51.825 --> 01:26:54.742
MATT: Two rolls, yeah, you have advantage.

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:56.814
LIAM: Oh! 15.

01:26:56.814 --> 01:27:04.487
MATT: 15! He looks at you with this big grin, and
you can now see his gnarled, yellow dwarven teeth,

01:27:04.487 --> 01:27:10.690
this railroad of terror that his mouth is. This
big smile. He reaches out, his beard poofing over

01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:19.331
the side, grabs it and goes, "See, now this is
dwarven hospitality!" He lifts his drink up and it

01:27:19.331 --> 01:27:22.966
spills a little bit on his arm. He's like, "Hey!"
Everyone lifts up and cheers again.

01:27:22.966 --> 01:27:26.328
(cheering)

01:27:26.328 --> 01:27:32.193
MATT: Everyone still keeps drinking through the
fog. It's like a bad sauna in here right now.

01:27:32.193 --> 01:27:37.317
Everyone's fighting their way through. At which
point now, Balgus slaps you on the shoulder, takes

01:27:37.317 --> 01:27:40.788
a drink, and wanders out of the fight ring, goes
and finds a table to sit down and begin chugging

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:41.676
what you gave him.

01:27:41.676 --> 01:27:45.432
SAM: Why don't we adjourn for the evening? Retire
to our rooms?

01:27:45.432 --> 01:27:47.104
TRAVIS: Why don't you go change out of bear form?

01:27:47.104 --> 01:27:49.891
MARISHA: Yeah, and I guess I can let Trinket
change out of mouse form.

01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:51.216
SAM: Why don't you wait until we're upstairs?

01:27:51.216 --> 01:27:53.536
LAURA: Can I take the mouse? Can I take Trinket?

01:27:53.536 --> 01:27:54.684
SAM: Here, rat-mouse-thing.

01:27:54.684 --> 01:27:59.127
LAURA: Okay, hi, Trinket! Oh, is his armor teeny
tiny too?

01:27:59.127 --> 01:28:02.901
MARISHA: Oh, does he have a tiny armor mouse?
Mouse armor!

01:28:02.901 --> 01:28:10.236
MATT: If you choose, while polymorphing him, you
could make it as a visual aesthetic. Because it

01:28:10.236 --> 01:28:13.899
was a quick impact, I would say it looks like a
normal mouse right now. Sorry. Next time!

01:28:13.899 --> 01:28:17.655
LAURA: Well you're still adorable little-- don't
poke him.

01:28:19.155 --> 01:28:21.146
MATT: (squeaks)

01:28:21.146 --> 01:28:22.471
LAURA: I stick him in my little pocket.

01:28:22.471 --> 01:28:27.135
LIAM: I grab a half a mug of ale off the table and
say, "Dwarven compatriots, we could not have

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:32.574
"expected a better welcome here in Kraghammer!
We'll see you tomorrow night for round two. Thank

01:28:32.574 --> 01:28:33.717
"you, one and all."

01:28:33.717 --> 01:28:35.500
ALL: Huzzah!

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:41.397
MATT: (cheering) Balgus goes, "Three more! You
said three more!" You see his empty cup on the table.

01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:43.124
TRAVIS: We did say three more.

01:28:43.124 --> 01:28:46.709
LAURA: I laugh and hustle her over and say: One,
two, three, put them in a row for this gentleman

01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:47.239
right here.

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:54.664
MATT: "Aye! (whispers) Thanks." She gives you like
a really earnest like, "Thank you." You now have a

01:28:54.664 --> 01:28:58.174
very good idea of how a good third of the tables
in this tavern are repaired.

01:28:58.174 --> 01:29:00.423
TRAVIS: He's tough.

01:29:00.423 --> 01:29:02.080
MATT: You guys head back up to the rooms.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.253
TRAVIS: You put some stank on him.

01:29:03.253 --> 01:29:06.551
MATT: Yeah, that was like a (vibrating) when you
got the impact on him.

01:29:06.551 --> 01:29:07.779
LAURA: Don't fight him, you guys.

01:29:07.779 --> 01:29:09.649
SAM: Oh, Grog's going to fight him at some point.

01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:11.459
MATT: I get the feeling that's probably going to
go down at some point.

01:29:11.459 --> 01:29:13.091
TRAVIS: He's going to be playmates with me.

01:29:13.091 --> 01:29:16.476
LIAM: It's just a misunderstanding. I'm sure he's
a lovely gentleman.

01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:23.942
MATT: You guys are heading back up to the room.
Which, it's not a hallway built for a bear. Your

01:29:23.942 --> 01:29:25.998
shoulders are squeezing through.

01:29:25.998 --> 01:29:27.255
LAURA: How big is the room?

01:29:27.255 --> 01:29:31.626
MATT: Well, each one of your rooms comfortably
fits two people, maybe. Like, one and a half?

01:29:32.289 --> 01:29:33.610
LAURA: Oh no. What will I do with Trinket?

01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:38.906
MATT: If you help push Trinket through the door.
Thankfully, dwarves are fairly wide folk, so the

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:43.006
doors are built for stouter folk, they're just not
very tall. You, actually, have to bend through,

01:29:43.006 --> 01:29:47.666
Grog, to get into your room. On the bed that you
lie on, your legs dangle a good two feet off the

01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:56.337
bottom, at maximum. You can push Trinket through
with a one, two, three! Or you can carry her

01:29:56.337 --> 01:29:57.993
through as a mouse, and then have her stuck in
there.

01:29:57.993 --> 01:29:58.598
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:58.598 --> 01:30:00.818
LIAM: That's all right. Neither of us need a
blanket now.

01:30:00.818 --> 01:30:01.900
LAURA: Well.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.033
MARISHA: How long can I keep her a mouse?

01:30:04.033 --> 01:30:06.814
LAURA: Him! Trinket's a boy, all of you, please.

01:30:06.814 --> 01:30:08.358
MARISHA: Up to an hour?

01:30:08.358 --> 01:30:09.957
MATT: I believe it is, yeah, concentration.

01:30:09.957 --> 01:30:12.435
TRAVIS: I mean, are there like stables?

01:30:12.435 --> 01:30:17.112
LAURA: You know, yeah. Can I go downstairs and ask
about stables? Maybe he can stay in the stables.

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:21.705
MATT: You have to talk to Adra. She's like,
"There's no stables in this establishment, but we

01:30:21.705 --> 01:30:24.755
do have a downstairs storage area your bear can
probably stay in."

01:30:24.755 --> 01:30:27.198
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a bear, he's fine.

01:30:27.198 --> 01:30:28.781
LAURA: Trinket, is that okay?

01:30:28.781 --> 01:30:30.568
TRAVIS: (as Trinket) Yeah, I'm fine.

01:30:30.568 --> 01:30:38.389
LAURA: All right, yeah, he's seems to think it's
all right. Let's go with the storage room. If

01:30:38.389 --> 01:30:40.871
there's anything that looks edible, you can eat
it. It's fine.

01:30:40.871 --> 01:30:41.791
MATT: "That's not true."

01:30:41.791 --> 01:30:43.035
LAURA: Just kidding!

01:30:43.035 --> 01:30:46.810
MATT: "I'll charge you later."

01:30:46.810 --> 01:30:50.563
MATT: You bring Trinket back down. Do you release
your polymorph?

01:30:50.563 --> 01:30:52.299
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:30:52.299 --> 01:30:56.639
MATT: Trinket becomes a bear again. I'd say the
room's probably a good 40 feet by 30 feet.

01:30:56.639 --> 01:30:57.749
LAURA: Oh, so he's fine.

01:30:57.749 --> 01:31:04.233
MATT: Half of it's filled with barrels and crates,
and storage of dried foods. Trinket comes in and

01:31:04.233 --> 01:31:11.028
(sniffing) and starts rummaging into one of the
half open sacks of dried meat. That's going to be

01:31:11.028 --> 01:31:12.037
put on your bill.

01:31:12.037 --> 01:31:12.764
LAURA: Shit.

01:31:12.764 --> 01:31:15.211
MATT: You head back to your rooms for the evening
to rest.

01:31:15.211 --> 01:31:16.149
MARISHA: Take a nap.

01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:17.862
MATT: Anything you guys want to do in preparation
for the next day?

01:31:17.862 --> 01:31:20.936
SAM: No, let's get it on.

01:31:20.936 --> 01:31:23.926
MARISHA: Oh, we should give our comment cards to
Balgus.

01:31:23.926 --> 01:31:25.507
TALIESIN: I think we should all turn in our
comment cards.

01:31:25.507 --> 01:31:28.757
LAURA: Oh, our comments cards, that's right.

01:31:28.757 --> 01:31:30.980
MATT: You turn in your comment cards for Balan.

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:31.868
MARISHA: Balan.

01:31:31.868 --> 01:31:33.894
TALIESIN: I can't stress how important this is.

01:31:33.894 --> 01:31:36.123
LIAM: Maybe we should-- go ahead, I'm sorry.

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:39.423
TALIESIN: No, no, really, no it's fine, speak over
me, I don't care.

01:31:39.423 --> 01:31:40.670
MARISHA: Here, take him the extras.

01:31:40.670 --> 01:31:43.644
TALIESIN: We're going to give him a few extras so
he can have more comments.

01:31:43.644 --> 01:31:44.189
MARISHA: Yes.

01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:46.871
SAM: You guys are so kind with these comment
cards.

01:31:46.871 --> 01:31:52.501
LIAM: Perhaps we should all go to bed, and the
humans back in North Hollywood should take a pee

01:31:52.501 --> 01:31:54.866
break. At some point.

01:31:54.866 --> 01:31:55.990
SAM: The humans?

01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:58.676
LIAM: You. You, and you and you and you and me.

01:31:58.676 --> 01:32:01.597
MATT: Yes, indeed. Do you want to take a quick
restroom break for the folks here?

01:32:01.597 --> 01:32:02.636
SAM: You okay?

01:32:02.636 --> 01:32:04.548
MATT: Zac?

01:32:04.548 --> 01:32:06.742
ZAC: What's that?

01:32:06.742 --> 01:32:08.948
MATT: Folks here might want to use the restroom
real fast.

01:32:08.948 --> 01:32:10.453
ZAC: You want me to play the intro videos again?

01:32:10.453 --> 01:32:14.369
MATT: You know what, go ahead and play some of the
intro videos and we'll come back here in a minute

01:32:14.369 --> 01:32:19.852
to continue the game, while everyone rests, and
empties their bladders. We'll be right back guys.

01:32:19.852 --> 01:32:20.745
Hang tight.

01:32:20.745 --> 01:32:22.201
SAM: Commercial break.

01:32:22.201 --> 01:32:30.921
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of

01:32:30.921 --> 01:32:38.971
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

01:32:38.971 --> 01:32:41.967
combat, women, and ale!

01:32:41.967 --> 01:32:43.773
[record scratch]

01:32:43.773 --> 01:32:50.749
TRAVIS: Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog
is often consulted for his vast knowledge of

01:32:50.749 --> 01:32:59.945
shapes, colors, and shiny things! Also ale. In his
early years, armed with his two-handed greataxe,

01:32:59.945 --> 01:33:06.579
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the
ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after

01:33:06.579 --> 01:33:13.498
coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the
woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent

01:33:13.498 --> 01:33:23.192
life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity
for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And

01:33:23.192 --> 01:33:30.677
his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody,
and banished by the herd leader, his Uncle Kevdak,

01:33:30.677 --> 01:33:39.068
Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from
his herd, it was then that the relative of the

01:33:39.068 --> 01:33:47.204
very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was
the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that

01:33:47.204 --> 01:33:53.932
healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.
And they have remained close friends ever since.

01:33:53.932 --> 01:34:01.868
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Or accompanying

01:34:01.868 --> 01:34:09.220
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors. Also ale!

01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:14.520
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:19.729
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:26.347
kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise
underestimate her based on first impressions.

01:34:26.347 --> 01:34:28.243
[thunder crack]

01:34:28.243 --> 01:34:33.192
MARISHA: Under that un-intimidating petite frame
is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose

01:34:33.192 --> 01:34:40.305
natural powers have made even the fiercest of
champions pee their pants, literally! Born to the

01:34:40.305 --> 01:34:46.090
Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised
with a deep love of nature and the elemental

01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:52.060
magics. It is her people's inherent duty to
protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:57.990
four elemental planes begin to bleed with this
realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite

01:34:57.990 --> 01:35:03.516
a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping
abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and

01:35:03.516 --> 01:35:11.101
flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do.
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of

01:35:11.101 --> 01:35:16.661
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to

01:35:16.661 --> 01:35:23.077
succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like
that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

01:35:23.077 --> 01:35:28.314
replaced with endless spell memorization,
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly

01:35:28.314 --> 01:35:34.588
high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must
embark on journey to seek out the sister tribes in

01:35:34.588 --> 01:35:40.251
order to introduce and establish respect amongst
the fellow headmasters. They call this the

01:35:40.251 --> 01:35:46.654
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly

01:35:46.654 --> 01:35:53.159
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she
will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain

01:35:53.159 --> 01:35:59.692
towards Stilben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong

01:35:59.692 --> 01:36:06.584
warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and
compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one

01:36:06.584 --> 01:36:11.935
thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even
worthy?

01:36:11.935 --> 01:36:18.797
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of seven
children, born to a noble family who lived far to

01:36:18.797 --> 01:36:24.060
the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:31.224
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the
sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a

01:36:31.224 --> 01:36:36.866
mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood,
came to court. During a feast held in their honor,

01:36:36.866 --> 01:36:42.288
the Briarwoods violently took control of the
castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would

01:36:42.288 --> 01:36:48.332
stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.

01:36:48.332 --> 01:36:55.616
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to

01:36:55.616 --> 01:37:01.324
the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river and floating

01:37:01.324 --> 01:37:07.355
unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the

01:37:07.355 --> 01:37:14.162
next two years, as he slowly made his way as far
south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:20.194
dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

01:37:20.194 --> 01:37:24.976
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first
gun.

01:37:24.976 --> 01:37:33.509
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

01:37:33.509 --> 01:37:39.221
eye on you. A talented musician, master of
disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

01:37:39.221 --> 01:37:46.992
Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his
own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his

01:37:46.992 --> 01:37:52.959
endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for
coin and support his single mother. One day, he

01:37:52.959 --> 01:37:59.419
was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined
Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where

01:37:59.419 --> 01:38:05.588
he learned the ways of the world, and honed his
skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:10.235
his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms
with the violent death of his mother at the hands

01:38:10.235 --> 01:38:16.190
of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say, educational

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:22.199
experiences with the opposite sex, deep down
Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known:

01:38:22.199 --> 01:38:30.099
the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan
considers himself a lover first, performer second,

01:38:30.099 --> 01:38:36.451
and fighter distant third. On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood,

01:38:36.451 --> 01:38:43.077
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count
on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song,

01:38:43.077 --> 01:38:48.068
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and
makes the females swoon.

01:38:48.068 --> 01:38:56.930
ORION: Greetings and salutations, I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

01:38:56.930 --> 01:39:03.085
located in the heart of Draconia, born from a
politically respected family. At the age of 15, I

01:39:03.085 --> 01:39:08.313
succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing
prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and

01:39:08.313 --> 01:39:12.943
the Draconian high council were amazed at how
powerful my spells were for how long I had been

01:39:12.943 --> 01:39:17.832
training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian

01:39:17.832 --> 01:39:23.909
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's

01:39:23.909 --> 01:39:30.395
rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a
chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room

01:39:30.395 --> 01:39:35.563
were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding
cities and areas around the known world. For

01:39:35.563 --> 01:39:40.535
months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned
of artifacts from legend. After a long period of

01:39:40.535 --> 01:39:45.202
research, I made a list of artifacts that caught
my eye. I brought these findings to the high

01:39:45.202 --> 01:39:50.071
council and was told that all of the information
in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either

01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:56.009
believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever. I found those answers

01:39:56.009 --> 01:40:01.752
to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse
and managed to convince the city council to lend

01:40:01.752 --> 01:40:06.683
support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of
peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

01:40:06.683 --> 01:40:11.754
Going from town to town and making friends and
allies in and for the name of Draconia. Being a

01:40:11.754 --> 01:40:17.828
red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands
in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed

01:40:17.828 --> 01:40:23.647
so I could explore the world and find these
artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some

01:40:23.647 --> 01:40:29.614
may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock
to all that. I am much sharper than most give me

01:40:29.614 --> 01:40:35.135
credit for. I just don't pay attention to things
sometimes. I've also been known to be rather

01:40:35.135 --> 01:40:42.509
cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

01:40:42.509 --> 01:40:46.881
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

01:40:46.881 --> 01:40:53.384
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

01:40:53.384 --> 01:41:00.079
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door. Along with twin sister

01:41:00.079 --> 01:41:07.138
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter
between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised

01:41:07.138 --> 01:41:12.280
by their mother in their early years, the twins
were eventually sent off to their father in the

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:17.659
elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception
among the elves there never warmed, and their time

01:41:17.659 --> 01:41:23.135
in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole
away one autumn night and set out on the open

01:41:23.135 --> 01:41:29.581
road. After a few years of wandering, they
eventually decided to return to their mother, and

01:41:29.581 --> 01:41:35.324
journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But
instead of finding their childhood home, they

01:41:35.324 --> 01:41:41.498
returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was
gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the

01:41:41.498 --> 01:41:50.898
townspeople for answers, they learned of the day
the dragon came. With their ties all severed,

01:41:50.898 --> 01:41:57.855
Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their
fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since

01:41:57.855 --> 01:42:04.456
birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's
challenges in his own particular way, often by

01:42:04.456 --> 01:42:12.581
sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for
circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of

01:42:12.581 --> 01:42:16.336
blades the elves schooled him in more than makes
up the difference.

01:42:16.336 --> 01:42:22.472
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

01:42:22.472 --> 01:42:29.750
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother, and an elven father who

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:34.950
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother,

01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:42.174
Vax'ildan, quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world were each other.

01:42:42.174 --> 01:42:47.960
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn,

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:54.687
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

01:42:54.687 --> 01:43:01.395
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

01:43:01.395 --> 01:43:09.513
indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax
took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

01:43:09.513 --> 01:43:17.530
learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to
the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the

01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:25.183
keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,
to spy and to shoot. Through a series of fateful

01:43:25.183 --> 01:43:32.504
events, earned herself a companion in the form of
a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight

01:43:32.504 --> 01:43:40.764
alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he
is adorable, and gives expert massages.

01:43:40.764 --> 01:43:45.263
MATT: Hello, everyone. Welcome back. We've had our
pee breaks. We've had our refills of our drinks.

01:43:45.263 --> 01:43:52.377
We've got Fireball, so I think we're good for the
next venture. Anyway, the party has taken their

01:43:52.377 --> 01:43:56.998
rest for the evening. Once again, this is one of
those weird experiences where you wake up, not

01:43:56.998 --> 01:44:00.709
because of the sun rising, because you can't see
it in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, but

01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:06.295
eventually you all come to consciousness
naturally. What is your plan of action?

01:44:06.295 --> 01:44:09.254
SAM: Oh, Jesus, we should have all talked about
this while we were all peeing.

01:44:09.254 --> 01:44:11.870
TRAVIS: We're going to beat up everybody, right?

01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:12.901
SAM: Are we going to the manor?

01:44:12.901 --> 01:44:14.837
TALIESIN: I say we have brunch, and we go to the
manor--

01:44:14.837 --> 01:44:16.594
LAURA and TRAVIS: Brunch?

01:44:16.594 --> 01:44:18.056
SAM: Eggs benedict.

01:44:18.056 --> 01:44:19.721
TALIESIN: I want dwarven brunch.

01:44:19.721 --> 01:44:21.745
LIAM: I want a traditional dwarven breakfast.

01:44:21.745 --> 01:44:24.345
MARISHA: Dwarven eggs are very good.

01:44:24.345 --> 01:44:27.210
TALIESIN: They're small.

01:44:27.210 --> 01:44:32.915
MATT: Okay, so Tiberius fills you all in about his
experience, trying to get into the House Thunderbrand.

01:44:32.928 --> 01:44:34.208
TRAVIS: How you almost got killed?

01:44:34.208 --> 01:44:37.682
ORION: I didn't, certainly not. I just couldn't
get in the door. Rather rude!

01:44:37.682 --> 01:44:44.386
MARISHA: Why did you think that after the magic
hand failed that the big thunder ice wave would work?

01:44:44.414 --> 01:44:47.958
ORION: What I thought is that I could cover the
rune with ice and merely step over it. I didn't

01:44:47.958 --> 01:44:49.362
think it would dissolve my ice.

01:44:49.362 --> 01:44:51.840
TRAVIS: Did you sleep?

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.628
ORION: Yes.

01:44:53.628 --> 01:44:57.243
TRAVIS: Oh. I had to make sure, you know.

01:44:57.243 --> 01:45:01.906
ORION: A good sorcerer always all his tricks
before turning around, which is what I did. I

01:45:01.906 --> 01:45:05.391
think we should go back there because I feel that
it's significant that I couldn't get in so easily.

01:45:05.391 --> 01:45:09.260
TALIESIN: We will go back there. I don't think
it's the next order of business but I think that

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:12.007
we're not leaving the city without dealing with
that.

01:45:12.007 --> 01:45:12.908
LAURA: Definitely.

01:45:12.908 --> 01:45:15.045
TRAVIS: Do we need to do something with the
comment cards?

01:45:15.045 --> 01:45:15.640
LAURA: Oh.

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.629
TALIESIN: Did you not fill out your comment card?

01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:23.679
TRAVIS: No, I did! I know, like, three letters, so
like A, F, and A.

01:45:23.679 --> 01:45:24.830
MARISHA: That's okay.

01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:26.410
TALIESIN: That sounds very positive.

01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:29.713
MARISHA: It's the thought that counts, Grog. It's
the thought that counts.

01:45:29.713 --> 01:45:32.298
LAURA: Did you put a smiley face next to the
A-F-A?

01:45:32.298 --> 01:45:33.747
TRAVIS: I covered my hand in ink.

01:45:33.747 --> 01:45:34.534
LAURA: That works.

01:45:34.534 --> 01:45:37.922
TALIESIN: Very good. I think that went well.

01:45:37.922 --> 01:45:41.462
SAM: Shall we try to make our way to the manor,
then?

01:45:41.462 --> 01:45:45.818
LAURA: The Greyspine Manor, with our cask of fancy
ale/wine.

01:45:45.818 --> 01:45:47.523
TRAVIS: Does the light ever change being
underground?

01:45:47.523 --> 01:45:52.712
MATT: No, it is a perpetual low red glow from all
the stones that are embedded around the streets.

01:45:52.948 --> 01:45:57.523
LAURA:I feel really sleepy and also very awake at
the same time.

01:45:57.523 --> 01:45:58.658
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

01:45:58.658 --> 01:45:59.687
MATT: Oh, dwarves.

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:01.839
LAURA: So what do you think?

01:46:01.839 --> 01:46:03.818
TALIESIN: Now I'm curious if there's dwarven
coffee.

01:46:03.818 --> 01:46:06.864
MATT: You guys make your way after your brunch,
your delicious dwarven brunch--

01:46:06.864 --> 01:46:07.802
TALIESIN: Thank you!

01:46:07.802 --> 01:46:09.292
MATT: -- which is very alcoholic.

01:46:09.292 --> 01:46:10.304
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:46:10.304 --> 01:46:14.477
TALIESIN: It's like being in New Orleans for the
weekend, every meal is going to come with

01:46:14.477 --> 01:46:16.020
something alcoholic.

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.722
LAURA: You're turning yourself into a dwarf?

01:46:17.722 --> 01:46:19.121
SAM: Did you catch that? He just turned himself
into a dwarf.

01:46:19.121 --> 01:46:19.961
TRAVIS: You did?

01:46:19.961 --> 01:46:21.653
MATT: Tiberius went (whoosh) into a dwarven form.

01:46:21.653 --> 01:46:23.523
LAURA: What kind of dwarf? What do you look like?

01:46:23.523 --> 01:46:25.170
SAM: He's very handsome for a dwarf.

01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:26.520
LAURA: Are you a girl dwarf?

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:28.093
MARISHA: Yes! You should be a lady dwarf.

01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.004
SAM: Oh yeah, what kind of dwarf? A lady dwarf?

01:46:30.004 --> 01:46:31.656
ORION: I would not do that again.

01:46:31.656 --> 01:46:33.889
TRAVIS: Oh, you did do that, you did take it as a
troll.

01:46:34.819 --> 01:46:37.912
ORION: Almost! She shot off the penis.

01:46:38.276 --> 01:46:40.143
LIAM: What is going on?

01:46:40.143 --> 01:46:41.526
TRAVIS: That's where the troll dick came from.

01:46:41.526 --> 01:46:44.226
ORION: Don't you remember, Vax? I was almost raped
by trolls.

01:46:44.226 --> 01:46:47.831
MATT: There was a cavern interaction with two male
trolls that they had stealthed up behind as a

01:46:47.831 --> 01:46:52.924
party. I love explaining this to the audience.
Tiberius then polymorphed into a female troll to

01:46:52.924 --> 01:46:57.812
try and Bugs Bunny them, not realizing that
dwarves who are underground and--

01:46:57.812 --> 01:46:58.929
LAURA: Trolls.

01:46:58.929 --> 01:47:04.820
MATT: --trolls don't encounter female trolls
often enough to have a one track mind. He nearly

01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:10.695
got himself in a very bad situation. That was
remedied by the party attacking and Vex over

01:47:10.695 --> 01:47:14.482
here shooting off the troll's dick. Which then
went in the bag of holding, which is disgusting.

01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:17.178
MARISHA: That's also where the hashtag not all
trolls came from.

01:47:17.178 --> 01:47:20.587
MATT: Yup, hashtag not all trolls came from that
game. That is horrible.

01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:23.453
TALIESIN: Oh god. Bring it back.

01:47:23.453 --> 01:47:25.463
MARISHA: Bringing it back.

01:47:25.463 --> 01:47:30.242
MATT: You guys make your way to the residential
district. The same guards are there who were there

01:47:30.242 --> 01:47:33.691
the previous night that encountered you guys so,
as you roll up with an entourage-

01:47:34.221 --> 01:47:36.209
SAM: How many are there?

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.934
MATT: Currently, there are four.

01:47:37.934 --> 01:47:39.725
TRAVIS: We can take them.

01:47:39.994 --> 01:47:43.475
LAURA: Hi. I wave at Thompson.

01:47:43.475 --> 01:47:48.554
MATT: He's actually not there. It's the two others
that were with you. He is noticeably absent.

01:47:48.554 --> 01:47:50.987
LAURA: Oh. Where's Thompson?

01:47:50.987 --> 01:47:53.250
MATT: They look at each other and they're like,
"He's been given the day off."

01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:54.634
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:59.523
LIAM: As you can see, we brought one of your
citizens with us to show us a tour of the city.

01:47:59.523 --> 01:48:00.977
SAM: That's you.

01:48:00.977 --> 01:48:03.922
MATT: "Citizen? I haven't see you about. What's
your name?"

01:48:03.922 --> 01:48:07.089
ORION: Oh, my name is Tiberius Kraghammer.

01:48:07.839 --> 01:48:10.965
(laughter)

01:48:10.965 --> 01:48:12.689
SAM: Like Johnny New York.

01:48:13.589 --> 01:48:16.121
ORION: Shoot, we're in Kraghammer, right?

01:48:16.121 --> 01:48:17.855
SAM: We're in Kraghammer.

01:48:17.855 --> 01:48:19.164
ORION: Oh, Stronghammer.

01:48:19.164 --> 01:48:20.632
SAM: Johnny New York.

01:48:21.207 --> 01:48:23.406
MATT: "What is it, Kraghammer, or what was it?"

01:48:23.543 --> 01:48:25.936
(laughter)

01:48:25.936 --> 01:48:30.715
ORION: I meant--I meant Stronghammer. Kraghammer
is my father's cousin's side.

01:48:30.915 --> 01:48:32.289
MATT: "How drunk are you?"

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.469
ORION: I've been drinking since I've woken.

01:48:34.469 --> 01:48:36.031
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:48:36.031 --> 01:48:37.568
SAM: See, he is one of you!

01:48:37.568 --> 01:48:39.074
TRAVIS: I had a lot of breakfast.

01:48:39.373 --> 01:48:41.125
ORION: Oh yay, 19.

01:48:41.125 --> 01:48:42.497
MATT: 19.

01:48:45.467 --> 01:48:47.478
TRAVIS: Tiberius Kraghammer.

01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:53.490
MATT: "All right, I haven't seen you around, but
obviously it's a bit early to be that fucked up."

01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:56.555
ORION: I've been very depressed, you know.

01:48:56.555 --> 01:49:01.610
MATT: Well, what's your business, if I might ask
again? You already seen the statue.

01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:05.849
LAURA: Yeah, we saw the statue, but we wanted to
get a better look at it. We brought this gift for

01:49:05.849 --> 01:49:09.919
the Greyspines and we wanted to present it to
them.

01:49:10.253 --> 01:49:15.547
MATT: The two new Carvers step forward and look at
it. "Ooh!"

01:49:15.547 --> 01:49:17.029
LAURA: It's really nice.

01:49:17.029 --> 01:49:25.247
MATT: One of them's like, "I'll tell you what. If
you let us taste a bit of that, we'll let you go."

01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:29.664
ORION: Oh, I mean, I've been drinking a lot of it,
sure!

01:49:29.664 --> 01:49:34.962
LAURA: A thimble of it because if any of it goes
missing-- Is it sealed? Can we tell if it's sealed?

01:49:35.165 --> 01:49:40.832
MATT: You look at it. It does not have any sort of
port or exit on it. It is just a solid barrel.

01:49:40.832 --> 01:49:43.018
ORION: Maybe, we can save some for them.

01:49:43.018 --> 01:49:46.874
LAURA:. If we open it, it'll ruin the barrel,
right?

01:49:46.874 --> 01:49:49.200
MATT: "Ah, that's right."

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:56.013
LAURA: Maybe we can save you a bottle of it when
we open it inside. We'll give it to you later.

01:49:56.013 --> 01:49:58.691
MATT: Make a persuasion check for that. It's a
very persuasion based encounter.

01:49:58.691 --> 01:50:01.496
LAURA: Should I roll that one that failed me
earlier or my little dice?

01:50:01.496 --> 01:50:03.660
MATT: The little dice! They haven't come out yet!

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.874
LAURA: (high-pitched) My little, tiny dice.

01:50:04.874 --> 01:50:06.359
MATT: Itty bitty dice.

01:50:06.359 --> 01:50:12.393
LAURA: Teeny tiny dice. Okay that's better, I
rolled a 23.

01:50:12.657 --> 01:50:20.879
MATT: Okay. They all look at each other. "If you
can save enough for all four of us, please do.

01:50:20.879 --> 01:50:23.423
Bring it back, we'll be looking forward to it."

01:50:23.423 --> 01:50:25.890
ORION: Do you have any flasks that we could use to
fill them up?

01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:28.513
LAURA: We've got some bottles, don't worry.

01:50:28.513 --> 01:50:37.338
MATT: "We'll be waiting. If you don't show with
the drink, we'll go right to our supervisor." They

01:50:37.338 --> 01:50:38.992
all nod.

01:50:38.992 --> 01:50:43.232
LAURA: Yeah, keep nodding. Here's the thing. I
don't know if I can save four bottles worth, but

01:50:43.232 --> 01:50:45.051
I'll save as much as I can.

01:50:45.051 --> 01:50:47.145
SAM and TALIESIN: Just say yes.

01:50:47.145 --> 01:50:49.511
LAURA: Hey, I've got it covered.

01:50:49.511 --> 01:51:00.894
LIAM: On our father's good name, we will bring you
some of this. That is a promise.

01:51:00.894 --> 01:51:02.601
TRAVIS: It's a good name.

01:51:02.601 --> 01:51:08.878
MATT: They all look about each other. "Fine.
Remember, we're waiting." They all lick their lips

01:51:08.878 --> 01:51:15.894
a little. They part and let you guys into the
residential district. You make your way to the

01:51:15.894 --> 01:51:19.126
very back. You can see House Greyspine. Once
again, guys, for those who haven't been there

01:51:19.126 --> 01:51:23.515
before, it's a beautiful arrangement. The iron
gate around it with spikes on the top. You can see

01:51:23.515 --> 01:51:28.682
the entire front yard, it's about a good 80 yard
walk to the front of the building itself. It's a

01:51:28.682 --> 01:51:32.952
quite a distance from the front gate and that
entire area is filled with like a stone garden

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:38.511
with various small sculptures and interesting
knick knacks they collected and put on display

01:51:38.511 --> 01:51:44.233
like as a small museum as you approach the front
of House Greyspine. You get to the front door as a

01:51:44.233 --> 01:51:50.842
large double oak door about ten feet tall, four
feet wide, currently closed. There is no handle on

01:51:50.842 --> 01:51:51.771
the door.

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:52.890
TRAVIS: No handle?

01:51:52.890 --> 01:51:53.691
MATT: No.

01:51:54.134 --> 01:51:58.250
ORION: Hold on, wait. Don't knock on anything.
Things shock you here.

01:51:58.522 --> 01:52:00.397
SAM: Let's go knock on the door.

01:52:00.397 --> 01:52:03.896
TALIESIN: I want to double check, see if there's a
bell to ring or there seems to be some sort of

01:52:04.014 --> 01:52:05.178
calling--

01:52:05.178 --> 01:52:10.644
MATT: Easily enough, you see next to the door
there is a small chain that protrudes from the

01:52:10.644 --> 01:52:13.785
stone wall. It has a small bulbous ball at the
end.

01:52:13.785 --> 01:52:15.293
TALIESIN: Ding ding. Ding-a-ding.

01:52:15.293 --> 01:52:20.738
MATT: You pull it. Not a ding, but a large
(clanging). It is a heavier chain than you

01:52:20.738 --> 01:52:25.876
expected. As you pull on it, you feel a large
hammer-like object is slamming into a brass-type

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:31.723
material as it echoes and resounds in the
building. Definitely announcing your presence.

01:52:31.723 --> 01:52:33.281
MARISHA: Percy, can I try?

01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:34.664
TALIESIN: If you must, yes.

01:52:34.664 --> 01:52:35.611
MARISHA: Okay!

01:52:35.611 --> 01:52:38.998
MATT: Boosh! It echoes into the house.

01:52:39.254 --> 01:52:41.536
MARISHA: I just wanted to do that once! I'm
sorry.

01:52:42.626 --> 01:52:44.631
SAM: Should we ding-dong-ditch?

01:52:44.961 --> 01:52:47.171
(laughter)

01:52:47.171 --> 01:52:51.680
LIAM: Scanlan perhaps a little ditty on strings
will ease our introduction.

01:52:51.826 --> 01:52:57.713
SAM: I'll start singing a little jaunty welcoming
song. (singing) Hello, hello, we're here to pay

01:52:57.713 --> 01:53:03.164
you calling. Hello, hello I don't know what rhymes
with calling.

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:06.548
TALIESIN: "Calling," at the very least. I thought
you would go right there.

01:53:06.611 --> 01:53:07.856
SAM: Yes, it's true.

01:53:07.856 --> 01:53:11.268
MATT: All right, are you going to play the music
for the sake of playing music?

01:53:11.268 --> 01:53:13.377
SAM: Yes, for now.

01:53:13.377 --> 01:53:18.245
MATT: All right. About ten seconds pass
before the door-- you hear a large (thudding) and

01:53:18.462 --> 01:53:25.313
one of the doors opens up. You see a dwarf, with
long gray hair that's slicked back and pulled into

01:53:25.313 --> 01:53:32.214
a ponytail. A very small trimmed beard, very
proper, steps out in long black robes and goes,

01:53:32.214 --> 01:53:34.445
"Can I help you?"

01:53:34.445 --> 01:53:35.824
TRAVIS: Percy?

01:53:35.824 --> 01:53:38.856
TALIESIN: Yes, Percival Fredrickstein von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III.

01:53:39.216 --> 01:53:41.344
ORION: You can call him Percy.

01:53:41.598 --> 01:53:46.536
TALIESIN: You can simply call me Percy, thank you.
We're here to discuss some business with Lord

01:53:46.536 --> 01:53:51.087
Greyspine and we have, of course, brought gifts and our
charming company.

01:53:51.866 --> 01:53:54.865
LIAM: As well as our dwarven compatriot to
introduce us.

01:53:54.865 --> 01:53:57.802
ORION: Yes, who? I am quite drunk right now.

01:53:57.802 --> 01:54:04.089
MATT: He gives you an awkward look. It's like a
look of trying to place your face. "Which lord are

01:54:04.089 --> 01:54:06.129
you looking for?"

01:54:06.129 --> 01:54:08.428
LAURA: Actually Nostoc.

01:54:08.428 --> 01:54:11.902
ORION: Is he the nice one? I would like the nice
one.

01:54:12.452 --> 01:54:16.270
MATT: "Nostoc, I'm afraid, is currently working at
the quarry, if he's who you're looking for."

01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:17.559
LAURA: Oh, of course he is.

01:54:17.559 --> 01:54:21.398
SAM: If Gradon is here, is that his name? Gradon?

01:54:21.705 --> 01:54:25.270
MATT: He gives you this look. "Gradem is not
taking visitors."

01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:26.649
LAURA: Of course not.

01:54:26.649 --> 01:54:31.640
TALIESIN: That's a shame, we brought this
half-barrel of ale right here and some--

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:36.351
SAM: And some very, very attractive mining
contracts, but if there's no one here to talk

01:54:36.351 --> 01:54:38.086
about them--

01:54:38.230 --> 01:54:41.410
MATT: He gives you this look. "If you're talking
mining contracts you want to head to the quarry

01:54:41.410 --> 01:54:49.683
and talk to, Lord--" Looking him up again in my
notes. "You want to talk to Nostoc Greyspine. He's

01:54:49.683 --> 01:54:55.795
the one who runs the quarry. As far as the
Ironkeeper himself-- I mean no offense, but only

01:54:55.795 --> 01:54:57.532
official political business."

01:54:57.532 --> 01:55:01.517
TALIESIN: Well, this is definitely official
political business. I will also say, could you

01:55:01.517 --> 01:55:03.034
direct us to the quarry?

01:55:03.034 --> 01:55:04.849
We are new in town.

01:55:04.849 --> 01:55:08.317
MATT: "Obviously. Have you not shown them 
where the quarry is, friend?"

01:55:08.317 --> 01:55:11.453
ORION: I have no idea what's going even going on.

01:55:11.459 --> 01:55:12.681
SAM: Jesus.

01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:14.841
TALIESIN: He's been drinking since very early this
morning.

01:55:14.841 --> 01:55:16.511
MARISHA: He's on vacation. You'll have to excuse
him.

01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:19.271
ORION: I must say, I am having a wonderful time.

01:55:19.343 --> 01:55:21.955
MARISHA: You know, friends are in town, he's
showing us around.

01:55:21.955 --> 01:55:24.374
TALIESIN: What was your name, again?

01:55:24.374 --> 01:55:31.197
MATT: The dwarf gives you a subtle look, goes, "My
name is Magrim. I am the servant of the Ironkeeper himself."

01:55:31.383 --> 01:55:34.499
TALIESIN: Magrim, of course you're the servant.
You are filled with poise and sophistication, and

01:55:34.499 --> 01:55:39.635
of course, above all, protocol. I would not wish
you to break protocol which is why some simple

01:55:39.635 --> 01:55:44.534
directions, for those of us who are wishing to do
some official business. You'll be right on your way

01:55:44.534 --> 01:55:46.631
and your house will return to order.

01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:59.684
MATT: "Right. The Ironkeeper is not open to
business outside of pre-approved political understanding."

01:55:59.856 --> 01:56:00.769
LAURA: Of course.

01:56:00.769 --> 01:56:06.387
MATT: "If you don't have a pre-approved meeting
put within our ledger, you won't be seen."

01:56:06.387 --> 01:56:10.613
LAURA: Of course not, but for the mining
contracts, however, wouldn't we need to speak to

01:56:10.613 --> 01:56:18.141
Nostoc? Is there any way-- I hear it's very hard
to get down into the mines. It's very

01:56:18.141 --> 01:56:21.464
well-guarded, right? That's why we came to speak
to him here.

01:56:21.464 --> 01:56:26.515
MATT: He leans over and looks at the cask of ale
and says, "Down to the mines, you have to go to

01:56:26.515 --> 01:56:31.795
one of the chain platform posts at the edge of
town that will bring you to the base area. Find

01:56:31.795 --> 01:56:38.130
your way to the mines there. That should be enough
to get Nostoc's attention. The rest is up to you."

01:56:38.314 --> 01:56:40.000
LAURA: Lovely. Thank you so much.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.200
SAM: One moment, before we adjourn-- (whispers) Do
we want to try to get into this place, or are we

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.910
just going to go to the mines?

01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:48.080
LAURA: (whispers) Maybe we should talk to Nostoc
first.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:49.548
SAM: And ditch this place?

01:56:49.548 --> 01:56:51.950
TALIESIN: Every time we break into someone's house
it turns out poorly.

01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:54.075
LAURA: We're trying to get to the mines,
essentially.

01:56:54.075 --> 01:56:55.947
LIAM: I think he's still listening.

01:56:57.977 --> 01:57:00.315
TALIESIN: Good man, good day. We'll
be on our way, thank you.

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:07.134
LAURA: Magrim, you've been wonderful. Thank you so
much. We plan on keeping some of this ale and

01:57:07.134 --> 01:57:10.951
bringing it back to the household. Would you like
some when we open the cask?

01:57:11.938 --> 01:57:17.936
MATT: He looks down at the cask, looks up at you
and says, "I would not turn down a sip or two."

01:57:18.559 --> 01:57:21.506
LAURA: Lovely. We'll be sure to save you a small
bottle.

01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:24.170
SAM: I'm going to turn invisible.

01:57:26.034 --> 01:57:30.280
MATT: As he's looking over there, you vanish. All
right.

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:32.006
LAURA: You can do that?!

01:57:32.006 --> 01:57:34.304
SAM: And I'm sneaking into the house.

01:57:34.742 --> 01:57:36.186
LIAM: To what end?!

01:57:36.186 --> 01:57:38.711
TRAVIS: That's awesome! Who cares? Light it up!

01:57:38.711 --> 01:57:40.168
SAM: I don't know why!

01:57:40.168 --> 01:57:41.605
TRAVIS: He's gone nuts!

01:57:41.605 --> 01:57:42.955
TALIESIN: We are off the reservation.

01:57:42.955 --> 01:57:44.914
MATT: "Is that all your business?"

01:57:45.052 --> 01:57:50.931
LAURA: I believe it is all of our business.

01:57:51.527 --> 01:57:59.971
MATT: "Well, good day." He steps back into the
doorway and closes the large oak doors. You are

01:57:59.971 --> 01:58:06.705
now standing in the foyer of Palace Greyspine. A
luxurious foyer, the floor itself is a fine dark

01:58:06.705 --> 01:58:12.572
velvet red carpet. There are tapestries across the
walls and small wooden end tables set at the edges

01:58:12.572 --> 01:58:20.268
of the hallway, this foyer area that contains
sculptures and vases and plants that exist

01:58:20.268 --> 01:58:25.120
underground specifically. There's a large stairway
that leads up into the upper portion of the house

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:28.216
and two doors at each side that lead to rooms you
no longer can see.

01:58:28.216 --> 01:58:32.081
ORION: I use the earpiece and whisper: What are
you doing, Scanlan?! What are you doing?!

01:58:32.081 --> 01:58:35.471
SAM: I don't know! Give me 20 minutes!

01:58:35.834 --> 01:58:39.343
LAURA: 20 minutes, that's okay! Let's all step
away from the house.

01:58:39.343 --> 01:58:43.993
MARISHA: Ask if he needs assistance or
divergent--

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:47.817
TALIESIN: Divergent?

01:58:47.879 --> 01:58:49.119
MARISHA: Divergent.

01:58:49.468 --> 01:58:55.182
MATT: Magrim wipes his hands and walks away going,
"(sigh) Fucking foreigners."

01:58:55.182 --> 01:58:56.776
SAM: I follow him where he's going.

01:58:56.776 --> 01:58:57.661
MATT: Okay.

01:58:57.661 --> 01:59:01.150
SAM: My nervousness, I let out a little bit of a
fart as we--

01:59:02.436 --> 01:59:04.631
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:59:05.162 --> 01:59:07.374
ORION: Why are you making it harder on yourself?

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:13.039
SAM: 14 plus I'm invisible, plus two. 16.

01:59:13.039 --> 01:59:17.082
MATT: Because you're invisible, I'll give you
advantage on that. Go ahead and roll.

01:59:19.563 --> 01:59:23.214
SAM: Oh, well. 14. Plus two. 16.

01:59:23.214 --> 01:59:31.200
MATT: As you scamper by, behind Magrim, following
him towards the kitchen area of the abode, Magrim

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:37.316
stops and turns, rubs his stomach, goes (groaning)
and continues walking forward, seemingly

01:59:37.316 --> 01:59:40.083
unperturbed by the sound.

01:59:41.009 --> 01:59:47.366
SAM: I'm snooping around, trying to see if there's
any lords or higher ranking individuals in the area.

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:51.702
MATT: Okay, I'll say within the time that you have
within the house, you wander through quite a few rooms.

01:59:51.702 --> 01:59:58.014
There's a wonderful music room, which contains a
number of dwarven instruments that you've read of

01:59:58.014 --> 02:00:02.984
and many instruments that you know as well. You
actually find another, what do you call it again?

02:00:03.317 --> 02:00:04.437
A shawm?

02:00:04.437 --> 02:00:05.482
SAM: Shawm.

02:00:05.482 --> 02:00:09.071
MATT: A shawm. You find another shawm within, more
finely crafted than the one that you have.

02:00:09.071 --> 02:00:10.187
SAM: Oh fuck.

02:00:10.187 --> 02:00:11.746
MATT: A gift of lords, if you will.

02:00:11.746 --> 02:00:13.237
SAM: I'm so tempted, but no.

02:00:13.237 --> 02:00:14.981
LAURA: Does he have an earring on? Does he have
one of our earrings?

02:00:14.981 --> 02:00:16.308
LIAM: We all do.

02:00:16.308 --> 02:00:18.182
MATT: Not everyone, you only made a few.

02:00:18.182 --> 02:00:19.417
SAM: Just me and him.

02:00:19.417 --> 02:00:20.349
LAURA: Who all has an earring?

02:00:20.349 --> 02:00:21.756
SAM: He can talk to me, apparently.

02:00:21.756 --> 02:00:26.412
LAURA: Tiberius, tell him to look for paperwork of
something. For the mines!

02:00:26.412 --> 02:00:30.724
ORION: Scanlan, look for paperwork of something
else, and by the way, all of you should be hearing

02:00:30.724 --> 02:00:32.893
me right now, you all have the ear--

02:00:32.893 --> 02:00:36.026
LAURA: Not everyone. You only made like five or
something.

02:00:36.085 --> 02:00:37.882
MATT: You could only afford five.

02:00:37.882 --> 02:00:39.780
ORION: That's right. (clears throat) Do all those
things, Scanlan.

02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:40.521
SAM: Great.

02:00:40.521 --> 02:00:41.646
TRAVIS: Who's talking right now?

02:00:41.646 --> 02:00:45.292
MATT: As you look about the household, you also
come across a couple of bed chambers that are

02:00:45.292 --> 02:00:48.501
locked, pretty hefty lock.

02:00:49.097 --> 02:00:50.202
SAM: Not going to try.

02:00:50.202 --> 02:00:53.871
MATT: Okay. You make your way up the stairway, and
there's a long hall that leads to, essentially, a

02:00:54.108 --> 02:01:00.281
throne room that is still partially under
construction, mostly finished. It actually was an

02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:07.573
intentional build onto this house. House
Greyspine, when the current Ironkeeper went into

02:01:07.573 --> 02:01:12.326
office, it seems, began to have this room built.
It's nearly finished, but it's an extravagant room

02:01:12.326 --> 02:01:18.319
with a large stone and dark metal throne, steps
lead up to it, and its raised dais-like pedestal

02:01:18.319 --> 02:01:24.991
in the center of the room. A series of great
magically glowing and flickering lanterns across

02:01:24.991 --> 02:01:28.575
them. There are two dwarves inside that are
currently finishing up the stone work. They're

02:01:28.575 --> 02:01:32.746
doing various sorts of masonry and plastering in
areas and carving out and chiselling out pieces of

02:01:32.746 --> 02:01:35.779
stone, and making them intricately carved in this
flavor. Other than that the room is currently

02:01:35.779 --> 02:01:37.277
empty.

02:01:37.947 --> 02:01:39.931
SAM: Shit. There's nothing to steal!

02:01:39.931 --> 02:01:42.094
TRAVIS: Drop a deuce in the bedroom!

02:01:43.431 --> 02:01:45.599
MATT: Hashtag "gnomishdeuce."

02:01:45.766 --> 02:01:48.300
ORION: Damn it, Scanlan! Just get out of there!
What are you doing?

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:49.776
LAURA: You totally should!

02:01:49.776 --> 02:01:51.330
TRAVIS and LAURA: An invisible poo!

02:01:51.330 --> 02:01:56.787
SAM: I might as well try one of the doors that's
locked, and see if I can pick it, but I'm not good

02:01:56.787 --> 02:01:58.762
at that, so I'll try.

02:01:58.762 --> 02:02:02.014
MATT: Okay. Do you have on your person any sort of
thieves' tools?

02:02:02.014 --> 02:02:05.049
SAM: I have a forgery kit, a poisoner's kit--

02:02:05.049 --> 02:02:07.608
MARISHA: Forge some thieves' tools real quick.

02:02:07.608 --> 02:02:12.281
SAM: Climbing gear? And a whip.

02:02:12.876 --> 02:02:18.898
LIAM: Matt, I have one of the earrings, and I say:
Scanlan, what exactly is the purpose for this

02:02:18.898 --> 02:02:21.940
little escapade, and will it be ending shortly?

02:02:22.687 --> 02:02:24.192
SAM: Can I reply?

02:02:24.192 --> 02:02:27.187
MATT: You can, through the message-based ear
enchantment.

02:02:27.187 --> 02:02:31.039
SAM: Just trust me that I have no idea what I'm
doing.

02:02:31.946 --> 02:02:33.650
MATT: Do you wish to pick one of the doors?

02:02:33.650 --> 02:02:34.905
TRAVIS: Do it.

02:02:34.905 --> 02:02:36.779
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to try one!

02:02:36.779 --> 02:02:38.314
MATT: Okay, you have disadvantage on this.

02:02:38.314 --> 02:02:39.778
SAM: Of course I do.

02:02:39.778 --> 02:02:45.351
MATT: So roll twice, and we'll consider this a
straight dexterity check.

02:02:45.351 --> 02:02:48.413
SAM: 11, plus zero?

02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:56.541
MATT: You futz with the door for a good minute,
trying to bend a piece of wire you had, thinking

02:02:56.541 --> 02:03:01.172
to forge some tumblers, and eventually get to a
point where you hear, (tink).

02:03:02.826 --> 02:03:04.458
And it broke.

02:03:06.057 --> 02:03:12.911
SAM: I can't do two spells at once, so I will give
it up and I'll make my way to the door.

02:03:12.911 --> 02:03:15.458
MATT: Okay. The door is currently closed.

02:03:16.527 --> 02:03:21.715
SAM: I become un-invisible and I cast Dimension
Door.

02:03:21.715 --> 02:03:27.226
MATT: All right. You blink through this small,
purplish arcane doorway. It brings you directly

02:03:27.226 --> 02:03:30.586
outside. You guys are waiting, Scanlan just pops
into view.

02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:40.260
SAM: It was crazy in there! People were farting
everywhere! It was not me. They're building a

02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:46.377
throne room, there were some locked doors. Man, I
wish you could have been there! It was exciting,

02:03:46.377 --> 02:03:49.997
but ultimately pointless. Let's go down to the
mines!

02:03:52.281 --> 02:03:57.582
LIAM: I would like to stress again that none of
these dwarves are our enemies, at all. We just

02:03:57.582 --> 02:04:00.947
want to go have some words with Greyspine.

02:04:00.947 --> 02:04:02.872
TRAVIS: That we do not have our healer, at
present.

02:04:02.872 --> 02:04:06.578
LIAM: Well, we do, but she's very distracted, and
is not feeling herself.

02:04:06.578 --> 02:04:09.345
SAM: She wanted to stay at the inn this morning.

02:04:09.345 --> 02:04:11.889
LIAM: She's feeling awfully BAFTA today, so.

02:04:13.011 --> 02:04:15.142
SAM: Let's make our way to the mines, shall we?

02:04:15.177 --> 02:04:16.677
ORION: Metal poisoning, yes.

02:04:16.677 --> 02:04:18.553
TRAVIS: To the mines, then, yeah.

02:04:18.553 --> 02:04:20.914
LIAM: Let's go get this drunk dwarf!

02:04:20.914 --> 02:04:23.542
MATT: Yes, the bard was doing a lockpick with no
lockpicks. He was fashioning it from wire.

02:04:25.733 --> 02:04:32.263
Exciting but pointless! You make your way to the
edge of the center ring. You find that there are

02:04:32.263 --> 02:04:37.126
long spiral staircases that move to the bottom,
where there are elevators that bring you to the

02:04:37.126 --> 02:04:45.644
bottom floor. The elevators are chain based, like
a ratchet-type system with two Carvers there, of

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:49.791
course. You approach one, eventually you talk with
them, they lead you down there, but once again

02:04:49.791 --> 02:04:52.037
they give you a look of, "Watch your back!"

02:04:52.075 --> 02:04:55.486
LAURA: We point at the ale and give him a thumbs
up!

02:04:55.486 --> 02:05:01.633
MATT: They nod, and let you pass. As you continue
downward into the lower area, you can see the red

02:05:01.633 --> 02:05:08.017
stone that lets a lot of the atmospheric glow of
Kraghammer is used less and less and a lot more

02:05:08.017 --> 02:05:14.195
central torches are now in place; sconces. The
stone itself is either rarer the further down you

02:05:14.195 --> 02:05:21.023
go or has less of an illuminating power the deeper
into the earth. You eventually reach into the

02:05:21.023 --> 02:05:25.145
center part of town. You now see from where you're
standing a number of large structures in the very

02:05:25.145 --> 02:05:29.370
center of the bottom part of the city of
Kraghammer. You can see--

02:05:33.927 --> 02:05:38.482
There is a giant domed temple that is

02:05:38.482 --> 02:05:43.907
made of gold and bronze in the center. It looks
almost like a gargantuan gazebo that has doorways

02:05:43.907 --> 02:05:49.109
on each side that is currently closed off. No
guards at it, though. You do see a number of other

02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:56.274
buildings. There is a large, heavy foundry far off
to the left of you that has a little bit of smoke

02:05:56.274 --> 02:06:01.991
that's coming off of it, but most of it looks to
be filtered into a giant, metallic funnel that is

02:06:01.991 --> 02:06:06.215
then placed into the rock. Almost like all the
smoke based exhaust is being funneled outside of

02:06:06.215 --> 02:06:12.756
the mountain. That is the closest; that's the
foundry. Then to the right of you, you wander a

02:06:12.756 --> 02:06:18.845
bit and you can begin to see that part of the
mountainside to the far right has that look of a

02:06:18.845 --> 02:06:23.145
strip mine, or like a large portion of the
minerals has been pulled away and is currently

02:06:23.145 --> 02:06:27.928
being mined further. That looks like probably one
of the better places to look in looking for the

02:06:27.928 --> 02:06:34.193
Greyspine Quarry. You eventually make your way to
the outside of the quarry. You now look down into

02:06:34.193 --> 02:06:39.230
three large pits that descend deeply into the side
of the mountain. This mine has been going for

02:06:39.230 --> 02:06:44.162
quite some time and a large chunk of this looks
like it may be being prepped; almost like the mine

02:06:44.162 --> 02:06:48.463
is what's growing Kraghammer. The more they mine
into the mountain, the more they fill the mined

02:06:48.463 --> 02:06:52.460
area with further city construction. It's this
self perpetuating cycle of expanding the city

02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:57.457
downward. Currently in the quarry, there are a
number of large stone dwarven buildings in the

02:06:57.457 --> 02:07:03.896
edge of it, one of which is the largest of them
all, looks like it's made more of a black and red,

02:07:03.896 --> 02:07:08.745
iron aesthetic; some of it's been oxidized a
little bit and has that rough and tumble, iron

02:07:08.745 --> 02:07:14.937
feel. That one has the most guards around the base
of it. The Carvers are gathered entirely around

02:07:14.937 --> 02:07:19.982
it. Looking down into the center of the quarry,
towards the bottom there are a number of tunnels

02:07:19.982 --> 02:07:25.423
that lead into the hillside of Cliffkeep Mountains
proper, surrounding Kraghammer.

02:07:26.393 --> 02:07:28.150
TRAVIS: Let's go where the guards are.

02:07:28.150 --> 02:07:29.654
LAURA: Let's walk towards the guards.

02:07:29.654 --> 02:07:31.408
LIAM: Let's just do this directly, I think.

02:07:31.408 --> 02:07:33.169
SAM: Just swords out.

02:07:33.475 --> 02:07:40.352
MARISHA: Wait. Before we go up, I take the cask of
ale and I grow some pretty flowers on it, and I

02:07:40.352 --> 02:07:43.804
make a nice pretty bow and I shine it up a
little.

02:07:43.804 --> 02:07:45.926
TALIESIN: You're making a fruit basket?

02:07:45.926 --> 02:07:49.503
MARISHA: No, I'm just-- it looks attractive now.

02:07:49.503 --> 02:07:51.400
TALIESIN: It looks like a fruit basket.

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.274
MARISHA: It does not look like a fruit basket.
It's not that ostentatious.

02:07:53.274 --> 02:07:55.368
TALIESIN: It's the "Ale of the Month" Club.

02:07:55.368 --> 02:07:58.948
LIAM: In her defense, they probably don't see
flowers too often. It's a nice touch.

02:07:59.201 --> 02:08:00.612
TALIESIN: That is very fair.

02:08:00.612 --> 02:08:02.587
ORION: I'm going to take this opportunity to cast
Stoneskin on myself.

02:08:02.587 --> 02:08:04.382
MATT: Okay. Stoneskin is placed on you.

02:08:04.382 --> 02:08:06.102
SAM: Are you a dwarf still?

02:08:06.102 --> 02:08:07.689
TALIESIN: Are you a dwarf made of stone?

02:08:07.689 --> 02:08:09.705
MATT: You have not turned Alter Self off. You are
still a dwarf.

02:08:09.705 --> 02:08:10.991
ORION: Yeah, that's fine.

02:08:10.991 --> 02:08:15.975
MATT: Oh, Stoneskin is a concentration spell, so
yes, that would eliminate the Alter Self spell.

02:08:15.975 --> 02:08:21.989
Okay, so you revert back to your dragon form,
robed self, but Stoneskin is in effect. You using

02:08:21.989 --> 02:08:24.769
your, what's it called again?

02:08:24.769 --> 02:08:25.975
MARISHA: Druidcraft.

02:08:25.975 --> 02:08:31.854
MATT: Druidcraft! Thank you. The Prestidigitation
for hippies. Portions of the wood begin to sprout

02:08:31.854 --> 02:08:38.072
from the outside of this dark wood barrel and form
these entangled ivy vines that eventually embrace

02:08:38.072 --> 02:08:42.495
the entirety of this cask with little buds of
dark, ruddy flowers. Something that would

02:08:42.495 --> 02:08:45.727
definitely appeal to a dwarven aesthetic.

02:08:45.727 --> 02:08:47.039
MARISHA: That's hot.

02:08:47.039 --> 02:08:50.557
MATT: You approach the guards, of which there are
eight currently at the front.

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:58.221
LAURA: Can I use my perception to see which one of
them looks maybe the most interested or weakest?

02:08:58.221 --> 02:08:59.905
MATT: Would be more of an insight.

02:08:59.905 --> 02:09:02.382
LAURA: Insight! Which one of them looks most
interested in our party.

02:09:02.382 --> 02:09:03.589
MATT: Yeah.

02:09:06.237 --> 02:09:11.110
LAURA: Oh, good. I thought that was a one, but
it's not. It was a 13.

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:17.938
MATT: 13? Okay. Strangely enough, they are fairly
distracted and after a rather long, uneventful

02:09:17.938 --> 02:09:23.341
morning, most of them are used to being in armor
and waiting for business to go down. There are a

02:09:23.341 --> 02:09:28.998
few along the edges that look a little more alert,
and one of them is looking occasionally down into

02:09:28.998 --> 02:09:32.324
the quarry. Just keeping an eye on the established
area.

02:09:32.876 --> 02:09:35.164
LAURA: Which one looks like the newest?

02:09:35.164 --> 02:09:38.437
MATT: The newest of the bunch would be the one
that's on the far left that is looking down into

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:44.808
the quarry as well. He has a shaved head, has a
small brownish beard that looks like he's starting

02:09:44.808 --> 02:09:49.563
to grow out into a nice, long tuft. Either it got
shaved in some, I don't know, terrible college

02:09:49.563 --> 02:09:55.469
dwarf accident. You know part of his entry into
some fraternity.

02:09:55.469 --> 02:09:57.853
TRAVIS: Dwarf Sigma Sigma.

02:09:58.492 --> 02:10:05.519
MATT: It's a fairly thick tuft of unkempt brown
beard that goes about that far out. It's starting

02:10:05.519 --> 02:10:09.363
to be pulled in like tiny little scruffy braids.
It's not quite there and he probably gets a lot of

02:10:09.363 --> 02:10:14.845
shit for it from the other dwarves. He seems to
generally be looking at you guys.

02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.646
LIAM: Okay, work your magic.

02:10:16.646 --> 02:10:18.762
TRAVIS: Yeah, do your thing-- fuck these dwarves
up.

02:10:18.762 --> 02:10:20.879
SAM: What are we trying to do?

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:27.553
LAURA: We brought this gift. Hello! We address all
of them, maybe, right now, yes?

02:10:27.553 --> 02:10:30.125
TALIESIN: She is better at this. I'm going to let
her do this.

02:10:30.125 --> 02:10:32.350
LAURA and SAM: Hello, hi!

02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:34.418
ORION: Greetings and salutations!

02:10:34.418 --> 02:10:38.006
MATT: The other guards reach back and grab their
weapons. One of them looking to you.

02:10:38.006 --> 02:10:40.544
ORION: Oh, you don't need that.

02:10:40.544 --> 02:10:44.782
LAURA: I look over at the shaved-head one and I
hold his gaze for a little bit.

02:10:44.782 --> 02:10:46.982
LIAM: I give Vex a little push forward.

02:10:47.577 --> 02:10:49.297
LAURA: Pardon me. Not yet!

02:10:49.892 --> 02:10:51.987
MATT: "All right, what's your business?"

02:10:52.153 --> 02:10:58.442
LAURA: Oh, yes, well-- we are here to speak with
Nostoc. We brought a gift for him that's quite

02:10:58.442 --> 02:11:00.300
remarkable, actually.

02:11:00.596 --> 02:11:06.915
MATT: They curl up around the apparent barrel that
Grog's holding. They look wary of Grog, but once

02:11:06.915 --> 02:11:09.955
they make note of the barrel they all, "Ooh!"

02:11:09.955 --> 02:11:12.525
TRAVIS: Right? It's the shit.

02:11:13.128 --> 02:11:17.598
MATT: "I've heard of that, but I've not seen
anyone actually drink it. There were long standing

02:11:17.598 --> 02:11:19.555
rumors that this even existed."

02:11:19.555 --> 02:11:20.653
LAURA: It exists.

02:11:20.653 --> 02:11:22.208
SAM: And it's for Nostoc.

02:11:22.208 --> 02:11:23.626
MATT: "This is a Balgus original?"

02:11:23.626 --> 02:11:24.753
LAURA: Yes.

02:11:24.753 --> 02:11:30.108
MATT "Signed by himself I see on the burned,
emblazoned wood. I'll go talk to him!" He heads

02:11:30.108 --> 02:11:34.456
inside of the building, the doors close behind
him. The other guards encroach, keeping a very

02:11:34.456 --> 02:11:39.977
keen eye, each one having a bead on the rest of
your group. About two minutes pass before he comes

02:11:39.977 --> 02:11:44.986
back, opens the door and the dwarf goes, "Nostoc
will see you briefly, but you best bring the gift.

02:11:44.986 --> 02:11:46.977
I think that's what's holding his interest."

02:11:46.977 --> 02:11:48.083
ORION: Wonderful!

02:11:48.083 --> 02:11:53.620
MATT: "Inside, please." Him and one other guard
flank you guys as you enter, making sure that you

02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:58.594
are not left without that appearance. You are led
into the center of this portion of the mine's main

02:11:58.594 --> 02:12:06.678
structure, a series of long hallways. There's this
general smell of soot and ash and broken stone

02:12:06.678 --> 02:12:12.398
dust in the air. A hint of brimstone-ish smell.
It's not very pleasant, it's very well worn and

02:12:12.398 --> 02:12:17.243
pungent for those of you who spend most of their
time on the surface. As you enter, there is a

02:12:17.243 --> 02:12:22.726
general dust in the air, a little light seems to
peek through from the torches that are placed up

02:12:22.726 --> 02:12:27.596
along the wall. You can see this general haze
amongst the interior here. It's definitely a work

02:12:27.596 --> 02:12:33.437
environment at the base of an underground dwarven
establishment used to mine. You are led further

02:12:33.464 --> 02:12:38.710
down the hallway. It curves to the left and you're
brought into a large dwarven study. There are

02:12:38.710 --> 02:12:43.455
books on the walls, a series of ledgers and paper
stacks on a large desk and at the center there

02:12:43.455 --> 02:12:48.582
sits a dwarf with fiery red hair cut very short,
almost like a buzz-cut on the top, with a long

02:12:48.582 --> 02:12:56.727
beard that is not braided, but kept very smooth
and very-- not curly, not bunched, it's a very

02:12:56.727 --> 02:13:02.442
straight beard. He's very clean cut, he already
has this intimidating dark glare. As you walk into

02:13:02.442 --> 02:13:10.783
the room he goes, "Okay, you brought me a drink.
You have my attention. What brings you to the mines?"

02:13:13.291 --> 02:13:15.917
SAM: We should have talked this through before.

02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:20.301
TALIESIN: Well, several things actually. Several
things bring us to the mine. My name, of course,

02:13:20.301 --> 02:13:23.161
is Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de
Rolo III.

02:13:23.161 --> 02:13:25.155
ALL: You can call him Percy!

02:13:25.558 --> 02:13:29.616
MATT: He raises his finger and goes, "You have not
paid for your pleasantries yet."

02:13:30.013 --> 02:13:32.987
LAURA: Oh, of course. Grog, if you would.

02:13:32.987 --> 02:13:35.522
LIAM: Tap that motherfucker!

02:13:41.546 --> 02:13:44.500
TRAVIS: I am assuming he had a goblet on the
table.

02:13:46.643 --> 02:13:52.196
MATT: As you pull it up he pulls under his desk
and pulls up a goblet. As you fill it, "Top it

02:13:52.262 --> 02:13:55.412
off! Thank you!

02:13:56.077 --> 02:13:58.190
Now put on the side of the desk!"

02:13:58.661 --> 02:14:01.238
SAM: Wait! Mister Greyspine.

02:14:02.631 --> 02:14:04.196
Oh, okay, all right.

02:14:04.196 --> 02:14:07.561
MATT: Puts it down. (satisfied sigh)

02:14:08.206 --> 02:14:11.047
LAURA: Is it as amazing as we've heard?

02:14:12.007 --> 02:14:19.466
MATT: "It's pretty fucking good." He takes another
long drag, while making sure you all watch him do

02:14:19.466 --> 02:14:23.379
this. This goes on probably a little longer, the
pageantry of him drinking this in front of you is

02:14:23.379 --> 02:14:28.957
definitely a power play, and he's establishing
some sort of unspoken dominance in the room.

02:14:29.721 --> 02:14:36.449
Eventually he finishes his tankard, sets it down
under the desk again. "Right, so where were we?"

02:14:37.591 --> 02:14:42.540
TALIESIN: We were here to call upon your
expertise. We imagine that we are not the first

02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:45.470
strangers to Kraghammer to come through--

02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:47.180
LAURA: -- in the last few weeks.

02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:53.479
TALIESIN: In the last few weeks. We believe one
of our compatriots had some dealings with you,

02:14:53.605 --> 02:14:59.138
perhaps not as pleasant as the dealings we are
hoping to have.

02:14:59.138 --> 02:15:01.456
SAM: A lady, in fact.

02:15:01.456 --> 02:15:03.224
LAURA: A halfling.

02:15:03.779 --> 02:15:07.668
MATT: At which point, as you say that, he gets
this grin to his face and goes, "Aye, I know of

02:15:07.668 --> 02:15:09.096
the one you speak."

02:15:09.096 --> 02:15:10.348
LAURA: Yes.

02:15:10.348 --> 02:15:12.416
MATT: "She is a strong-headed one, that one."

02:15:12.416 --> 02:15:13.458
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:15:13.783 --> 02:15:17.350
MATT: "She stepped on a few toes around this
place."

02:15:17.594 --> 02:15:19.571
ORION: Oh, was she clumsy?

02:15:20.692 --> 02:15:27.091
MATT: "One could say that, aye. You say you are
compatriots of hers?"

02:15:27.091 --> 02:15:32.158
TALIESIN: We're here to mend any broken bridges,
so to speak.

02:15:32.158 --> 02:15:34.973
MARISHA: Or broken toes, if you will.

02:15:34.973 --> 02:15:38.829
MATT: "She certainly left a mess in her wake.
There's this strange vision quest she kept talking

02:15:38.829 --> 02:15:44.763
about. It brought her into atmospheres-- portions
of this city, portions of my business that she has

02:15:44.763 --> 02:15:52.401
no right trespassing on. She went against Carver
rules, she broke away from partial arrest and she

02:15:52.401 --> 02:15:58.260
went screaming down into the caverns of our mines
without my permission, blade drawn on some crazed

02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:00.057
suicide mission."

02:16:00.657 --> 02:16:07.093
LAURA: You know what? We'll go after her. We'll
bring her out. We'll get her out of your mines.

02:16:07.093 --> 02:16:09.155
MATT: "Great. I'd like that actually."

02:16:09.155 --> 02:16:10.257
LAURA: Good!

02:16:10.257 --> 02:16:14.701
TALIESIN: We'd be happy to clear out anything
unpleasant that we happen to find in there in the meantime."

02:16:15.187 --> 02:16:17.585
ORION: How did she look?

02:16:17.585 --> 02:16:18.930
TRAVIS: What?

02:16:19.542 --> 02:16:27.170
MATT: "She looked small and angry. She seemed to
have some weight to her. She was a strong lass."

02:16:27.258 --> 02:16:29.665
ORION: So not a looker is what you are saying.

02:16:29.665 --> 02:16:35.932
MATT: He gives you this strange look and goes, "I
will not discuss the physical aesthetics of a halfling."

02:16:36.055 --> 02:16:37.787
SAM: The dwarf is a feminist.

02:16:37.787 --> 02:16:44.107
LAURA: How much would this task be worth to you?
Obviously we are doing you quite a favor and we

02:16:44.107 --> 02:16:46.490
brought you quite a gift!

02:16:47.746 --> 02:16:50.249
SAM: This cost us a thousand gold.

02:16:51.367 --> 02:16:54.106
MATT: "Obviously this lass means a lot to you,
doesn't she?"

02:16:54.106 --> 02:16:59.789
LAURA: No, but I know she is probably wreaking
havoc on your mines.

02:16:59.884 --> 02:17:04.977
LIAM: We've come to correct the wrongs that she's
done and come to bring her home.

02:17:04.977 --> 02:17:10.531
MARISHA: It also sounds like there are some other
terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines.

02:17:10.531 --> 02:17:14.070
MATT: "There is nothing going on, we're fine. We
have everything under control, we don't need your

02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:19.700
help for that. If you want to find your friend, go
find her! If she is still alive. If not, take her

02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:22.037
corpse back and leave."

02:17:22.037 --> 02:17:26.013
TALIESIN: It's not help, sir. We are simply
respecting you as a businessman. As a businessman

02:17:26.182 --> 02:17:34.698
I'm sure that you would disagree with unceremonious charity
whether it would be to give it or receive it. We

02:17:34.698 --> 02:17:39.485
are making sure that our dealings with you are
fair and balanced.

02:17:39.485 --> 02:17:43.999
MATT: "I appreciate your offering. You have bought
your time. Now, if you are here to go find your

02:17:43.999 --> 02:17:51.629
friend, I'll let you pass. You may pass into the
mine, but if at any moment you cross over to any

02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:54.271
sort of thieving bullshite--"

02:17:54.271 --> 02:17:58.615
Looks over at you. "I recommend--"

02:17:59.081 --> 02:18:01.770
(laughter)

02:18:02.286 --> 02:18:06.084
"I recommend-- that you fall down
the same path your friend likely did and get

02:18:06.084 --> 02:18:10.518
killed real quick. I don't take kindly to those
who cross on my business."

02:18:10.518 --> 02:18:14.924
TALIESIN: I doubt that we could find anything of
more value that what we have already brought you.

02:18:14.924 --> 02:18:21.202
LIAM: We are here to right wrongs and I promise
you, our business is finding her and returning home."

02:18:21.211 --> 02:18:22.767
MATT: "Then go."

02:18:22.767 --> 02:18:24.098
LAURA: Is that our business?

02:18:24.098 --> 02:18:26.437
TRAVIS: Yeah, we are here to right wrongs and
right lefts.

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:29.084
TALIESIN: And write comment cards.

02:18:29.388 --> 02:18:35.587
MARISHA: Wait, before we dive into this mountain--
we know that there's ghouls and god knows what

02:18:35.587 --> 02:18:38.273
else down there. Shouldn't we find out?

02:18:38.273 --> 02:18:41.797
ORION: Yes, we should. Maybe some arcane house
could tell us how to deal with these things.

02:18:41.797 --> 02:18:48.211
LAURA: Yes. Do we have permission to enter within
the next few days? Obviously we might need to be prepared.

02:18:48.211 --> 02:18:51.627
ORION: Yes, do we have badges that we wear over so
that they know--?

02:18:56.741 --> 02:19:07.115
MATT: "I'll speak with the men. They'll let you
down. If you come back, good on you. I think our

02:19:07.115 --> 02:19:08.577
business here is done."

02:19:08.577 --> 02:19:09.791
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:19:09.791 --> 02:19:15.342
MATT: At which point, you hear muffled in the
distance a loud ringing of a very loud bell.

02:19:15.342 --> 02:19:18.102
(dinging)

02:19:18.272 --> 02:19:25.721
At which point, he perks up a bit. "Our business here is done.
Please, shove off."

02:19:25.952 --> 02:19:27.975
SAM: Which way do we go?

02:19:27.975 --> 02:19:34.795
MATT: He looks over to the two other guards who
are up front. The two Carvers say, "This way."

02:19:34.795 --> 02:19:41.048
LIAM: While he is talking I take a flask out of my
cloak and approach the barrel and surreptitiously

02:19:41.048 --> 02:19:44.958
pour a little bit of it into the flask.

02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:46.429
MATT: Sleight of hand check.

02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:47.715
SAM: You're stealing beer?!

02:19:47.715 --> 02:19:50.217
ORION: No, because we have to give it to those
guards.

02:19:50.217 --> 02:19:52.300
SAM: Fuck those guards, I can kill them all.

02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:55.502
LAURA: Can I talk to good old Nostoc while he's
doing that?

02:19:55.895 --> 02:20:00.790
MATT: He currently does not seem like the
talkative type at the moment, you can certainly try.

02:20:00.821 --> 02:20:04.429
TALIESIN: I am going to make a fumble. I am going
to attempt to assist a sleight of hand with a bit

02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:05.502
of a fumble.

02:20:05.502 --> 02:20:06.525
MATT: He has already rolled it.

02:20:06.525 --> 02:20:09.702
LAURA: Damn it. I am going to fall down. In front
of Nostoc.

02:20:09.702 --> 02:20:11.110
SAM: Oh!

02:20:11.525 --> 02:20:12.921
LIAM: 13.

02:20:12.921 --> 02:20:14.832
LAURA: I am going to fall down in front of
Nostoc.

02:20:14.832 --> 02:20:16.150
MARISHA: Come on!

02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:18.074
TALIESIN: He is distracted by a bell.

02:20:20.504 --> 02:20:22.507
MATT: As you fill your flask--

02:20:22.540 --> 02:20:24.691
TRAVIS: Shit. Balls. Ass.

02:20:27.355 --> 02:20:30.134
MATT: You hear this loud-- (clears throat).

02:20:32.248 --> 02:20:38.292
LAURA: Ow, oh my ankle! It hurts so very much.

02:20:38.292 --> 02:20:49.012
MATT: This is the first time you have witnessed
the pristine, delicate yet well trained palm of a

02:20:49.012 --> 02:20:52.407
dwarven hand go straight to its forehead.

02:20:53.737 --> 02:21:01.900
LIAM: I carry the flask up to his cup and refill
it and say: In my kingdom when a deal is set we

02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:09.168
drink together. I would like, not much, but to
pour us all a drink and agree, surely this cask is

02:21:09.168 --> 02:21:11.958
weeks' worth of drink--

02:21:11.958 --> 02:21:16.698
MATT: "Get out of my office."

02:21:16.863 --> 02:21:19.194
MARISHA: Take the flask, take the flask.

02:21:19.286 --> 02:21:22.010
LIAM: I can see it is a cultural difference, my
apologies.

02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:25.390
ORION: Stop it. Just go! What are you doing?

02:21:25.390 --> 02:21:27.390
LIAM: You're one to talk!

02:21:27.390 --> 02:21:29.308
ORION: I'm on the earring.

02:21:29.308 --> 02:21:32.681
MATT: A second and a third bell starts going off
and the guards that are waiting for you guys.

02:21:32.681 --> 02:21:33.681
They're like--

02:21:36.111 --> 02:21:40.776
They start leading you outside and as you make your way
outside the main building, you can now hear voices

02:21:40.843 --> 02:21:42.960
shouting, down in the quarry below.

02:21:42.995 --> 02:21:47.192
LAURA: I lean down to one of the guards and say:
What is that bell for?

02:21:47.779 --> 02:21:49.985
MATT: "Something is flushing out of the quarry."

02:21:49.985 --> 02:21:51.736
LAURA: Flushing, what does that mean?

02:21:51.736 --> 02:21:58.083
MATT: "We don't know." Some of the guards are
motioning each other to follow and some of them

02:21:58.083 --> 02:22:01.381
start going down to one of the tracks that leads
down to one of the nearest quarry below.

02:22:01.381 --> 02:22:06.536
TALIESIN: Just try and like practically usher our
guards in that direction, since they seem to want

02:22:06.536 --> 02:22:10.064
to go in that direction. Let's see if we can push
them in that direction.

02:22:10.064 --> 02:22:14.862
MATT: Okay, you guys follow down towards the
quarry, you ask the guard that question and he

02:22:14.862 --> 02:22:18.053
goes, "I don't know, we've had quite a few
interesting things come through."

02:22:18.053 --> 02:22:20.463
LAURA: Like what? Oh, like what?

02:22:20.463 --> 02:22:23.842
MATT: He swallows and says, "Things I can't
describe."

02:22:24.170 --> 02:22:26.318
TALIESIN: Well, we can certainly help, lead on.

02:22:26.318 --> 02:22:28.902
MARISHA: Is there anybody running out?

02:22:28.902 --> 02:22:35.858
MATT: Not yet. As you head halfway down the quarry
walkway, you begin seeing dwarves start running

02:22:36.083 --> 02:22:38.481
out of one of the large quarry tunnels.

02:22:38.481 --> 02:22:40.355
MARISHA: I grab one of them.

02:22:40.355 --> 02:22:43.319
MATT: Well, they're quite a distance from you.
You're still walking down the side. They're a good

02:22:43.319 --> 02:22:47.639
100 feet from you. They start running at you, you
see blood streaking down one of their faces.

02:22:47.953 --> 02:22:49.007
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:22:49.007 --> 02:22:52.379
MATT: They're charging out, one of them has a
weapon and is limping, and you start seeing small

02:22:52.379 --> 02:22:59.708
green scampering things rushing through. One, two,
three, four, six, ten goblins come rushing out of

02:22:59.708 --> 02:23:00.652
the tunnel.

02:23:00.652 --> 02:23:02.435
SAM: Ah, I don't like these guys.

02:23:02.435 --> 02:23:03.839
LAURA: We should attack them! I string my bow.

02:23:03.839 --> 02:23:06.373
MARISHA: Don't you have family history with them?

02:23:06.373 --> 02:23:10.438
MATT: The three dwarves that are running out, one
of them gets hacked down by one of the goblins and

02:23:10.438 --> 02:23:12.130
jumps on them and is tearing his neck.

02:23:12.130 --> 02:23:13.746
TALIESIN: I take a shot. Right now.

02:23:13.746 --> 02:23:15.136
LAURA: I take a shot. I shoot it!

02:23:15.136 --> 02:23:16.409
MATT: Okay, both you guys roll--

02:23:16.409 --> 02:23:17.546
LIAM: I throw a dagger.

02:23:17.546 --> 02:23:18.671
MATT: You throw a dagger?

02:23:18.671 --> 02:23:19.805
Three of you, roll for attack.

02:23:21.192 --> 02:23:22.659
TALIESIN: 19.

02:23:23.734 --> 02:23:24.818
LAURA: 15.

02:23:25.294 --> 02:23:28.100
ORION: Is there a clear area where there's a bunch
of goblins running?

02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:30.719
MATT: There is an open funnel towards the tunnel.

02:23:30.719 --> 02:23:34.209
ORION: I'm going to throw a little Fireball, right
there where those guys are.

02:23:34.209 --> 02:23:39.109
MATT: Okay, you guys you all hit from this
distance because goblins are puny little things.

02:23:39.109 --> 02:23:41.487
They're still a little small to see, but you're
all pretty well trained and pretty honed with your

02:23:41.487 --> 02:23:48.159
aim. You fire simultaneously, gunshot echo through
the hallway, arrows, flying dagger, you see three

02:23:48.159 --> 02:23:55.936
goblins fall off a nearby dwarf who goes,
"Thank--" At which point a large fireball

02:23:55.936 --> 02:24:01.241
explodes, killing off about ten or so of the
goblins and probably two of the dwarves.

02:24:01.471 --> 02:24:03.113
ORION: Sorry about that!

02:24:03.113 --> 02:24:04.432
MATT: The guards stopped.

02:24:04.432 --> 02:24:05.557
SAM: Did you do that?

02:24:05.557 --> 02:24:06.350
ORION: Yeah.

02:24:06.350 --> 02:24:07.355
SAM: Fuck.

02:24:07.355 --> 02:24:10.541
MATT: They they start looking around and they see
you pull out your weapons and they all take a step

02:24:10.774 --> 02:24:16.178
back and realize they don't want to die either.
"Well go, if you're going to help, go!"

02:24:16.570 --> 02:24:18.070
TALIESIN: We run straight in.

02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:21.673
MATT: With you guys charging in, you can now see a
handful more goblins are rushing out. They are

02:24:21.673 --> 02:24:23.870
like running really fast, sprinting.

02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:30.879
MARISHA: I throw Entangle up, in the distance
wherever they're coming from.

02:24:30.879 --> 02:24:32.706
MATT: Okay, what's the radius on that?

02:24:32.706 --> 02:24:33.931
MARISHA: Like a hundred feet.

02:24:33.931 --> 02:24:35.809
MATT: That's the range. What is the radius?

02:24:35.809 --> 02:24:37.591
MARISHA: Oh, 20-foot radius.

02:24:37.591 --> 02:24:44.081
MATT: Okay. You find a portion of the central
point where the things exit from the tunnel and

02:24:44.081 --> 02:24:49.280
these strange reddish vines begin to protrude and
to begin to grab nearby goblins and pull them up

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:57.948
in this massive, weird vine creature. You hear
(stomping) and you now see two larger ogre-like

02:24:57.948 --> 02:24:59.529
creatures come storming out.

02:24:59.529 --> 02:25:01.268
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

02:25:01.268 --> 02:25:02.698
ORION: Wonderful!

02:25:02.698 --> 02:25:03.728
MATT: Everyone roll initiative.

02:25:03.728 --> 02:25:07.293
(cheering)

02:25:12.163 --> 02:25:14.492
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. Goddamn it.

02:25:14.492 --> 02:25:15.745
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

02:25:15.745 --> 02:25:17.519
TRAVIS: Take it!

02:25:18.057 --> 02:25:22.035
MATT: All right, do we have initiatives 25 to 20?

02:25:22.035 --> 02:25:23.171
TALIESIN: 27.

02:25:23.171 --> 02:25:24.445
ORION: 21.

02:25:24.445 --> 02:25:26.117
LAURA: Wait! I didn't roll yet.

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:27.511
MARISHA: You rolled a 20?

02:25:27.511 --> 02:25:29.098
TALIESIN: I rolled a 20 plus seven.

02:25:29.098 --> 02:25:30.425
MATT: 21, you said?

02:25:30.425 --> 02:25:31.713
ORION: I have 21.

02:25:31.713 --> 02:25:34.746
MATT: 21 for Tiberius. What did you get? One? Aw.

02:25:34.746 --> 02:25:37.327
MARISHA: Oh, I rolled a two.

02:25:37.327 --> 02:25:38.749
LIAM: It's six with the plus.

02:25:38.749 --> 02:25:41.255
SAM: Fellows. I don't like goblins.

02:25:41.255 --> 02:25:42.773
LAURA: 18.

02:25:43.091 --> 02:25:46.874
MATT: You now see Scanlan, who's usually a jovial
individual, his eyes begin to tense with fury.

02:25:46.874 --> 02:25:48.830
SAM: I don't like goblins.

02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:50.457
MARISHA: Is there anything that you know?

02:25:50.457 --> 02:25:56.179
SAM: No, they will all die. Don't spare any of
them.

02:25:56.179 --> 02:25:57.710
TRAVIS: Copy that.

02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:58.993
LAURA: 18.

02:25:58.993 --> 02:26:00.464
MATT: All right, so we have--

02:26:00.464 --> 02:26:01.956
TRAVIS: 18, too.

02:26:03.386 --> 02:26:04.688
TALIESIN: 27!

02:26:05.798 --> 02:26:06.780
LAURA: What?!

02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:07.908
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.

02:26:07.908 --> 02:26:09.695
TALIESIN: I have 27 initiative.

02:26:09.695 --> 02:26:14.892
MATT: 15 to ten? Ten to five? Six.

02:26:14.892 --> 02:26:17.125
TALIESIN: Wow, oh my god.

02:26:17.125 --> 02:26:18.980
SAM: I got a three.

02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:20.977
MATT: Okay. All right.

02:26:20.977 --> 02:26:23.172
MARISHA: Four.

02:26:24.521 --> 02:26:26.283
LIAM: It was a sudden attack, man.

02:26:26.283 --> 02:26:27.819
SAM: We weren't ready.

02:26:27.819 --> 02:26:29.302
MATT: You got a three.

02:26:29.302 --> 02:26:33.816
MARISHA: To be fair I just cast Entangle. It
works. I'm distracted holding Entangle.

02:26:33.816 --> 02:26:40.823
MATT: Yeah, it's fine. Then we have Scanlan. I'll
get you guys in placement here, as your bear is

02:26:40.823 --> 02:26:43.045
currently back at the inn.

02:26:43.045 --> 02:26:44.297
LAURA: He is still?

02:26:44.297 --> 02:26:46.129
MATT: Unless you wanted to bring him along.

02:26:46.129 --> 02:26:48.871
LAURA: Well, I thought I brought him. I should
have mentioned that.

02:26:48.871 --> 02:26:51.311
MATT: All right, we'll say you brought him along.
That's fine.

02:26:51.311 --> 02:26:54.315
LAURA: I'm sorry, I should have emphasized that
more.

02:26:54.315 --> 02:26:59.900
MATT: That's all right. Those of you going first,
we're going to keep you on the field here.

02:27:03.490 --> 02:27:04.783
LAURA: Oh god.

02:27:06.524 --> 02:27:09.535
MATT: A number of goblins that are currently held
over here.

02:27:12.077 --> 02:27:15.556
LAURA: They're easy. Goblins are easy. Orcs are not.

02:27:15.928 --> 02:27:17.860
TRAVIS: Yeah, those are mine.

02:27:18.350 --> 02:27:19.791
LAURA: Ogres?!

02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:22.447
MATT: Top of the round, Percy you're up.

02:27:22.447 --> 02:27:25.137
TALIESIN: I'm sitting down and I'm busting out Bad
News.

02:27:25.137 --> 02:27:27.100
MARISHA: Bust out Bad News!

02:27:27.583 --> 02:27:33.986
MATT: Percy stops just as he gets to the quarry, a
little bit elevated, and he pulls out from a small

02:27:33.986 --> 02:27:39.693
sack on his back this large elongated contraption,
this weird construction that looks similar to the

02:27:39.693 --> 02:27:44.265
pepperbox he usually carries, but much larger and
cumbersome. He sets it up on the ground with a

02:27:44.265 --> 02:27:45.980
small stand at the front

02:27:45.980 --> 02:27:48.208
and preps itself with a visual point.

02:27:48.208 --> 02:27:49.316
TALIESIN: Ogre.

02:27:49.316 --> 02:27:50.540
MATT: Ogre back here?

02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:51.357
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:27:51.544 --> 02:27:53.599
MATT: All right, roll for your attack with Bad
News.

02:27:53.599 --> 02:27:55.086
MARISHA: Have you used it before?

02:27:55.086 --> 02:27:56.545
TALIESIN: Nope, first time.

02:27:56.545 --> 02:27:58.849
MATT: His own tinkered construction, Bad News.

02:28:00.108 --> 02:28:03.292
TALIESIN: That's a 30 attack.

02:28:03.292 --> 02:28:06.338
MATT: Yep, that'll do it. Go ahead and roll
damage.

02:28:06.338 --> 02:28:08.085
MARISHA: Does that critical for you?

02:28:08.085 --> 02:28:10.196
TALIESIN: 19 actually might.

02:28:10.196 --> 02:28:11.472
MATT: Natural 19?

02:28:11.472 --> 02:28:12.554
TALIESIN: Natural 19.

02:28:12.554 --> 02:28:14.032
MATT: Yeah, that should critical for you.

02:28:14.032 --> 02:28:17.780
TALIESIN: That does critical for me. I've never
criticaled with this either. What does that mean?

02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:21.827
MATT: That means the damage dice you double. Roll
for damage, double that, and add your modifier

02:28:21.827 --> 02:28:23.080
after that.

02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:28.418
MARISHA: Come on! Big money, no whammies. Yeah!
Hell yeah!

02:28:28.418 --> 02:28:32.102
TALIESIN: (counting) 27 points of damage.

02:28:32.102 --> 02:28:33.878
TRAVIS: Get after it, big man!

02:28:33.878 --> 02:28:35.376
MARISHA: Is that doubled?

02:28:35.376 --> 02:28:37.164
TALIESIN: That's doubled.

02:28:37.164 --> 02:28:42.253
MATT: You guys hear this cacophonous, large
blasting sound, a flash of blue energy and sparks

02:28:42.253 --> 02:28:46.284
shoot out the back of the weapon. It actually
lifts Percy off the ground for a second and he

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:53.036
shifts himself from the sheer blast. This
streaking, heated bullet, reddish, white hot, goes

02:28:53.036 --> 02:28:58.147
cascading through the air, plunges into the side
of the ogre's shoulder with a smattering of blood

02:28:58.147 --> 02:29:01.552
splattering against the cave behind it. It's
actually moved back a step and has to catch

02:29:01.552 --> 02:29:08.129
itself. Slams its club into the ground. That ends
your turn?

02:29:08.129 --> 02:29:11.455
TALIESIN: I can't do anything after that. That's
just reload.

02:29:11.455 --> 02:29:12.945
MATT: Tiberius, you're up.

02:29:12.945 --> 02:29:14.939
ORION: I move within 60 feet of those big
fellows.

02:29:14.939 --> 02:29:16.939
TALIESIN: Bad news travels far and fast.

02:29:16.939 --> 02:29:19.078
MARISHA: Nothing travels faster.

02:29:19.678 --> 02:29:21.283
MATT: This is the entanglement, by the way.

02:29:21.283 --> 02:29:22.739
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:29:22.739 --> 02:29:24.809
ORION: Right before there.

02:29:24.809 --> 02:29:26.890
MATT: Everything there is fighting from the
entanglement.

02:29:26.890 --> 02:29:29.096
Most of these goblins are currently inside of it.

02:29:29.158 --> 02:29:31.896
ORION: I'm going to shoot a Scorching Ray at the
big guy.

02:29:31.896 --> 02:29:33.471
MATT: Both of them?

02:29:33.471 --> 02:29:35.455
SAM: He said he moved within 60 feet of them.

02:29:35.455 --> 02:29:37.372
MATT: You moved up to here? All righty.

02:29:37.372 --> 02:29:39.083
MARISHA: They're all entangled, yeah?

02:29:39.083 --> 02:29:40.952
ORION: That's good right there.

02:29:40.952 --> 02:29:42.628
MARISHA: Still have Entagle up.

02:29:42.628 --> 02:29:46.525
MATT: These guys here are entangled. These front
goblins are not. Scorching Ray you said at which ones?

02:29:46.530 --> 02:29:51.719
ORION: Actually, oh there's a bunch of those
dudes, aren't there? I'm going to do a Fireball

02:29:51.845 --> 02:29:56.149
instead, right in the center of the juiciness
where I can get a couple little guys and both the

02:29:56.149 --> 02:29:57.582
big guys.

02:29:57.582 --> 02:30:00.416
MATT: All right, so I'd probably about there would
be where you'd want it.

02:30:00.416 --> 02:30:04.246
ORION: I'm going to do that, and I'm going to
spend two sorcerer points immediately to do

02:30:04.246 --> 02:30:07.240
quickening spell and do another spell right after
that.

02:30:07.240 --> 02:30:11.150
MATT: Okay. As you rush up, you pull back your
hand and you see the arcane red energy begin to

02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:15.553
flow in your palm. You then throw the beam out,
and it arcs, slams into the center, and explodes

02:30:15.553 --> 02:30:20.999
hitting each of these five goblins and the two
ogres. What's your DC on your spell?

02:30:20.999 --> 02:30:23.738
ORION: My DC on my spell is--

02:30:24.285 --> 02:30:26.159
MATT: Top of your spell page on the right.

02:30:26.159 --> 02:30:28.254
ORION: Oh! Wait. Oh! 17, sorry.

02:30:28.254 --> 02:30:31.926
MATT: 17, okay. Wow! The two ogres actually make
their saving throws.

02:30:31.926 --> 02:30:32.954
LAURA: Ugh!

02:30:32.954 --> 02:30:34.225
MARISHA: Boo!

02:30:34.225 --> 02:30:35.600
MATT: They got 18 and a 19.

02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:37.600
TRAVIS: Roll crappier, ogres!

02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:40.183
MATT: The goblins, however, all disintegrate.

02:30:40.183 --> 02:30:41.643
LAURA: All of them?

02:30:41.643 --> 02:30:45.193
MATT: There's no way they're going to survive the
damage you-- they (poofing). You see this hint of

02:30:45.193 --> 02:30:50.756
a red ash mist go, (squeaking) where they once
were, and they are all turned to black

02:30:50.756 --> 02:30:54.772
nothingness. However, roll damage for the ogres.
They get half damage because they made their

02:30:54.772 --> 02:30:57.658
reflex save. So 8d6 damage.

02:30:57.658 --> 02:30:59.841
SAM: 8d6.

02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:10.487
SAM: (counting) 27!

02:31:10.487 --> 02:31:11.761
TRAVIS: What?!

02:31:11.761 --> 02:31:19.347
MATT: 27, so half that. As the blast of fire
dissipates, you can see one of the ogres is now

02:31:19.347 --> 02:31:23.204
burnt on half of its chest. Looking a little
rough. There's blood streaking down from the side

02:31:23.204 --> 02:31:27.544
of his face where the shrapnel got thrown at him.
The other ogre's looking okay.

02:31:27.923 --> 02:31:29.381
ORION: He's a large creature isn't he?

02:31:29.381 --> 02:31:30.600
MATT: Yes.

02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:33.403
ORION: I'm going to use my second spell and do
Telekinesis and pick one up and try to hurl him

02:31:33.403 --> 02:31:35.309
into the other one.

02:31:35.309 --> 02:31:37.867
MATT: Okay. Which one? The one left here?

02:31:37.867 --> 02:31:39.500
ORION: The one that's beaten up already.

02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:41.471
SAM: I'm hard right now!

02:31:41.866 --> 02:31:52.515
MATT: He does fail his saving throw. You lift him
up in the air and throw him into that. That ogre

02:31:52.515 --> 02:31:54.801
is knocked prone by the impact.

02:31:54.801 --> 02:31:56.838
ALL: Yeah!

02:31:56.838 --> 02:32:00.603
MATT: The other one is also knocked prone. Before
(splatting) into the wall, both of them slam to

02:32:00.603 --> 02:32:02.108
the ground.

02:32:02.108 --> 02:32:04.967
MARISHA: With my vines, I make sure my vines
really grapple him.

02:32:04.967 --> 02:32:07.631
ORION: I turn to Grog: They're all yours, buddy!

02:32:07.904 --> 02:32:10.655
MATT: Go ahead and roll 2d6 impact damage for the
force of the throw.

02:32:10.655 --> 02:32:12.601
ORION: Sweet! Impact damage?

02:32:12.601 --> 02:32:13.155
Ten.

02:32:13.155 --> 02:32:14.813
MATT: Ten damage to each of them?

02:32:14.813 --> 02:32:15.791
ORION: Yeah.

02:32:15.791 --> 02:32:19.610
MATT: All right. Both of the ogres are now on the
ground reeling from the impact. That brings us to

02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:22.177
Grog and Vex going simultaneously.

02:32:22.354 --> 02:32:24.541
TRAVIS: Ladies first.

02:32:24.541 --> 02:32:29.145
LAURA: Oh! Well, all right. I'm going to cast
Hunter's Mark on the most damaged one.

02:32:29.145 --> 02:32:30.587
MATT: Okay, that'd be this one here.

02:32:30.587 --> 02:32:36.882
LAURA: All right. Then I'm going to shoot
Lightning Arrow.

02:32:36.882 --> 02:32:39.122
MATT: All right. Do you want to move a little
closer?

02:32:39.122 --> 02:32:40.474
LAURA: Yes, I do.

02:32:40.474 --> 02:32:44.546
MATT: All right. That would put you right there.

02:32:44.655 --> 02:32:48.072
LAURA: All right, cool. I'm going to shoot
Lightning Arrow at them.

02:32:48.072 --> 02:32:51.856
MATT: Okay. You pull out your arrow and as you
pull it back, a little bit of energy courses

02:32:51.856 --> 02:32:55.246
through your fingers, strikes through your arrow.
You can now see this crackling energy as you're

02:32:55.246 --> 02:32:59.963
pulling it taut in your bow. You let it loose,
roll for attack.

02:32:59.963 --> 02:33:01.154
LAURA: Okay!

02:33:04.121 --> 02:33:05.129
21!

02:33:05.129 --> 02:33:06.552
MATT: 21 hits.

02:33:06.552 --> 02:33:11.103
LAURA: All right. Then I do something else. 1d8.
Right?

02:33:11.103 --> 02:33:14.007
MATT: Yep. You do the damage of the arrow plus the
damage of the spell.

02:33:14.007 --> 02:33:24.629
LAURA: Holy moly! So that's this. 13 for the arrow
and then 4d8 for the spell.

02:33:30.374 --> 02:33:33.766
(counting) 17!

02:33:33.766 --> 02:33:39.545
MATT: 17. Okay. The ogre that's been beaten,
blasted by the fireball, it's getting up--

02:33:39.545 --> 02:33:43.504
(grunt). It grabs its club, and it begins to get
up on one leg as the Lightning Arrow slams into

02:33:43.504 --> 02:33:47.792
its chest. You can see it hits. Looks down for a
second, and then the charge pulses through its

02:33:47.792 --> 02:33:53.812
entire torso. As it does, it screams out, "Ugh!"
into the cavern, its whole muscle system locks

02:33:53.812 --> 02:34:00.364
tight and it falls forward again, onto its chest,
smoke rising off of its whole upper area,

02:34:00.364 --> 02:34:02.845
unmoving, on the ground. He is gone.

02:34:02.845 --> 02:34:04.736
TRAVIS: Dang! Come on now!

02:34:04.892 --> 02:34:09.016
LAURA: Yes! Then the other one takes 2d8 if he
fails his saving throw.

02:34:09.016 --> 02:34:11.224
MATT: Which, with a one, he does.

02:34:11.224 --> 02:34:13.877
LAURA: Yes! Oh, he fails it so good.

02:34:14.496 --> 02:34:16.844
MATT: Go ahead a roll damage for other ogre.

02:34:16.844 --> 02:34:19.150
LAURA: Two. ten.

02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:24.286
MATT: Ten damage. Nice. As he falls to the ground,
the arc arcs over to the other one who drops his

02:34:24.286 --> 02:34:27.654
club for a second. Picks it up angrily.

02:34:27.654 --> 02:34:29.965
LAURA: I can reassign my Hunter's Mark to him
now?

02:34:29.965 --> 02:34:31.009
MATT: You can.

02:34:31.009 --> 02:34:31.829
LAURA: Yes.

02:34:31.829 --> 02:34:34.081
MATT: Yes, all right. That brings us to--

02:34:34.322 --> 02:34:39.041
LAURA: Oh, my Hunter's Mark! I didn't do my
Hunter's Mark damage. But it doesn't matter. He's dead.

02:34:39.041 --> 02:34:40.462
MATT: It doesn't matter. You killed him.

02:34:40.462 --> 02:34:41.294
LAURA: All right, cool.

02:34:41.294 --> 02:34:45.703
MATT: You just ultra killed him! (valley girl
voice) He is so dead. Oh my god. This ogre is

02:34:45.703 --> 02:34:51.259
done. (normal voice) All right. The other ogre's
angry. It's now the goblins' turn. These goblins

02:34:51.259 --> 02:34:55.288
rush up. They are dashing forward.

02:34:55.331 --> 02:34:58.005
MARISHA: (valley girl voice) They are so dead.

02:34:58.005 --> 02:35:01.031
TALIESIN: (valley girl voice) They're just, like, dead.

02:35:01.031 --> 02:35:05.864
This one moves around, and this one runs 
around to there. No attacks.

02:35:06.638 --> 02:35:08.418
Everyone make an insight check.

02:35:08.418 --> 02:35:10.319
SAM: Insight check? Oh shit.

02:35:10.319 --> 02:35:13.075
MARISHA: What happened? Why are we doing this?

02:35:13.075 --> 02:35:15.048
TALIESIN: I literally get a one.

02:35:15.048 --> 02:35:18.857
TRAVIS: (sings) Natural 20! On an insight check.

02:35:18.857 --> 02:35:20.799
MARISHA: 20 total. 20.

02:35:20.799 --> 02:35:21.835
LAURA: 22.

02:35:21.835 --> 02:35:23.068
ORION: Four.

02:35:23.306 --> 02:35:25.867
TALIESIN: Natural one. I'm really not paying
attention.

02:35:25.887 --> 02:35:29.141
MATT: You're dealing with the fact that you just
fired your gun for the first time and it burned

02:35:29.141 --> 02:35:30.612
your hands a little. You're like "Ugh!"

02:35:31.866 --> 02:35:33.909
SAM and MATT: Grog.

02:35:33.909 --> 02:35:35.666
TRAVIS: Recites poetry.

02:35:35.666 --> 02:35:41.201
MATT: Grog is familiar with one thing, fear in the
eyes of his enemies. Looking at these goblins,

02:35:41.201 --> 02:35:46.939
they're not charging to attack. The attacks seem
to be instinctual. They are running.

02:35:47.153 --> 02:35:48.795
MARISHA: Oh, no!

02:35:48.795 --> 02:35:50.259
MATT: They are scared.

02:35:50.259 --> 02:35:51.296
LAURA: Yes!

02:35:51.296 --> 02:35:52.762
MATT: They are fleeing from something.

02:35:52.912 --> 02:35:54.154
SAM: From the ogres?

02:35:54.154 --> 02:35:56.201
TRAVIS: Something behind the ogres.

02:35:56.201 --> 02:35:57.658
LAURA: Oh, no.

02:35:58.780 --> 02:36:01.749
SAM: May I make a request that you kill them
anyway?

02:36:01.749 --> 02:36:04.527
TRAVIS: It's like playing croquet at this point,
so yes.

02:36:04.617 --> 02:36:06.027
(laughter)

02:36:06.127 --> 02:36:07.728
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

02:36:07.728 --> 02:36:13.766
TRAVIS: I would like to rage! And I would like to move
to the right of all those stinking goblins!

02:36:13.958 --> 02:36:15.193
MATT: Right over here?

02:36:15.193 --> 02:36:17.999
TRAVIS: Yeah, a little more to the right. Yeah, a
little more. Yeah, keep going. All the way

02:36:17.999 --> 02:36:25.287
flanking it there. Yeah. Yeah, and then I would
like to give them the cleanest shave possible with

02:36:25.287 --> 02:36:27.047
my greataxe.

02:36:27.594 --> 02:36:30.343
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for attack on
the first one.

02:36:30.947 --> 02:36:34.400
TRAVIS: 18 plus eight. That's 26?

02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:37.106
MATT: That definitively hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

02:36:37.106 --> 02:36:38.620
TRAVIS: Oh, damage, crap.

02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:40.104
LIAM: (sings) Decapitation!

02:36:40.104 --> 02:36:44.909
TRAVIS: Two plus the four. 13!

02:36:44.909 --> 02:36:53.505
MATT: 13? Okay. As you rush up, you bring your axe
into the first goblin to your right (whoosh) clean.

02:36:53.643 --> 02:36:58.282
You don't even feel resistance. You hear this
little (wheeze) sound as this being is bisected.

02:36:58.282 --> 02:36:59.644
TRAVIS: Oh, that was cute.

02:36:59.644 --> 02:37:02.652
MATT: Its head and upper torso rolling off to the
side before rolling to a stop. However, the

02:37:02.652 --> 02:37:06.098
inertia of your axe still keeps through to the one
on the other side of you. Go ahead and roll for

02:37:06.098 --> 02:37:07.757
your second attack on that.

02:37:09.265 --> 02:37:10.299
TRAVIS: 21!

02:37:10.299 --> 02:37:11.863
MATT: Also hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:37:13.556 --> 02:37:17.917
TRAVIS: Oh, that was eight plus seven is 15!

02:37:17.917 --> 02:37:22.925
MATT: As you cleave through the first goblin, you
swing around, another goblin looks up at you,

02:37:22.925 --> 02:37:27.122
scared, and pulls a dagger out with its gnarled
tongue, (hisses), at which point the axe embeds

02:37:27.122 --> 02:37:32.259
itself straight into its face. Its angry face
goes, "Ugh!" and falls slack against your blade.

02:37:32.259 --> 02:37:37.421
You lift backward, and it's stuck to the edge of
your axe. Just limply dangling against-- you shake

02:37:37.421 --> 02:37:39.149
it off a little bit.

02:37:39.149 --> 02:37:41.472
TRAVIS: Double prizes! Yeah!

02:37:42.339 --> 02:37:45.978
MATT: Great. That ends your turn. The thing about
rage is that you can use your bonus action for a

02:37:45.978 --> 02:37:51.157
third attack. If you wanted to do a frenzy action,
but you don't need to. That brings us to the

02:37:51.157 --> 02:37:58.278
ogre's turn. The ogre gets up, let's see if it
makes its saving throw for an attempt to get out.

02:37:58.539 --> 02:38:09.250
It does with an 18. However, the ogre gets about
that far. It's going to make a double move.

02:38:09.250 --> 02:38:10.436
LAURA: Double move?!

02:38:10.436 --> 02:38:11.874
TALIESIN: He's running.

02:38:11.874 --> 02:38:13.563
MARISHA: I still have Entangle up.

02:38:13.563 --> 02:38:14.932
MATT: I know. He managed to resist it.

02:38:14.932 --> 02:38:15.939
LAURA: He saved against it.

02:38:15.939 --> 02:38:17.133
MATT: It's a big ogre.

02:38:17.133 --> 02:38:18.971
MARISHA: Poop.

02:38:18.971 --> 02:38:24.302
MATT: The ogre takes his full turn to get up in
melee with you guys. It does not have its attack

02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:28.199
since it used its full movement there. Once again, you
see as it's lumbering forward, it also has this

02:38:28.199 --> 02:38:30.005
look in its eye of desperation.

02:38:30.005 --> 02:38:30.946
SAM: Oh crap.

02:38:30.946 --> 02:38:32.218
ORION: We should just let it pass.

02:38:32.228 --> 02:38:33.695
MATT: Now it is Vax's go.

02:38:33.909 --> 02:38:36.052
LIAM: My sister's right in the face of the ogre,
correct?

02:38:36.052 --> 02:38:37.016
MATT: Correct.

02:38:37.016 --> 02:38:43.716
LIAM: Excellent. I'm going to take a run towards
my sister, since she's right close to him, he's distracted

02:38:43.894 --> 02:38:48.665
so I'm going to turn just as I get to her, so my
back presses against hers and swing around and

02:38:48.665 --> 02:38:50.628
sneak attack two daggers up in his belly.

02:38:50.628 --> 02:38:52.659
LAURA: We've practiced this, I turn.

02:38:53.326 --> 02:38:57.242
MATT: All right. As you dodge to the side, this
blur of shadow and speed, you coast up to the side

02:38:57.242 --> 02:39:00.553
of your sister, dagger both plunge towards the
side of the ogre. Go ahead and roll for an

02:39:00.553 --> 02:39:01.475
attack.

02:39:02.266 --> 02:39:08.413
LIAM: All right. One. Then the other one I do a
poison dagger, gets a (singing) 20!

02:39:08.413 --> 02:39:10.207
TRAVIS: Oh, put it on him brother!

02:39:10.207 --> 02:39:12.195
MATT: All right.

02:39:12.195 --> 02:39:21.138
LIAM: That is dagger of venom, 1d4. Three, plus
two is five, and then is the sneak attack damage

02:39:21.138 --> 02:39:22.220
go with--?

02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:24.711
MATT: Yeah it does because you have another ally
adjacent to it. You don't get advantage on the

02:39:24.711 --> 02:39:26.825
attack roll, but you can still do the sneak
attack.

02:39:27.008 --> 02:39:28.776
LIAM: Critical hit, too, as well, wouldn't it?

02:39:28.776 --> 02:39:30.900
MATT: Yeah! You can multiply the sneak attack
damage.

02:39:30.900 --> 02:39:33.397
LIAM: Five, plus- and the double goes to the sneak
attack damage?

02:39:33.397 --> 02:39:37.257
MATT: It does. Modifiers don't double, but any
dice you roll double.

02:39:37.257 --> 02:39:40.257
LIAM: Nine, 15--

02:39:40.257 --> 02:39:42.071
MATT: In my game. (clicks tongue)

02:39:42.071 --> 02:39:44.614
LIAM: So 30 plus five, 35.

02:39:44.614 --> 02:39:46.201
MATT: 35 damage.

02:39:46.201 --> 02:39:48.028
LIAM: Plus poison.

02:39:48.028 --> 02:39:52.978
MATT: The poison's not going to factor in. You
swing past her, both blades jam right into the

02:39:52.978 --> 02:39:59.311
side of its rib cage. You hear it howl out in
pain. As it does, you twist the daggers in a way

02:39:59.311 --> 02:40:04.017
where both blades are now going in two different
directions, and you carve out a section of its

02:40:04.017 --> 02:40:10.447
entire abdomen. As you do, the flesh, like whale
blubber, sloughs off the sides of it. Organs spill

02:40:10.447 --> 02:40:17.948
out, intestines, and it looks down and tries to
pull them back in. You see the color draining from

02:40:17.948 --> 02:40:24.640
its face, and you lean up and kick it down. The
ogre and falls to the ground lifeless, destroyed.

02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:27.873
TALIESIN: You gave him just enough time to regret
everything that had ever happened.

02:40:27.873 --> 02:40:29.280
MATT: Yes.

02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:31.398
TALIESIN: Well done. Bad life choices.

02:40:31.398 --> 02:40:33.095
MATT: That brings us to Keyleth.

02:40:33.095 --> 02:40:35.083
MARISHA: I didn't call my mom enough.

02:40:35.083 --> 02:40:36.693
LAURA: There are two goblins left?

02:40:36.693 --> 02:40:38.863
MATT: There are two goblins left.

02:40:38.927 --> 02:40:48.249
MARISHA: Okay. I do a quick sprint jog up up
towards Grog and go (boof) and bring up a big

02:40:48.249 --> 02:40:51.578
stone wall. Right where that entrance is.

02:40:51.578 --> 02:40:52.869
MATT: Right here?

02:40:52.869 --> 02:40:54.813
MARISHA: No. Like, right where things are pouring
out.

02:40:54.813 --> 02:40:55.801
MATT: Right, here?

02:40:55.801 --> 02:40:56.737
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:40:56.737 --> 02:40:57.991
MATT: All right, Wall of Stone.

02:40:57.991 --> 02:40:59.552
MARISHA: Wall of Stone-- boom.

02:40:59.552 --> 02:41:05.394
MATT: All right. A giant wall of stone now
completely seals off that part of the mine.

02:41:05.930 --> 02:41:09.917
MARISHA: We don't know what's in there, we should
talk about this for a second, and I bought us some

02:41:09.917 --> 02:41:12.994
time. I'm sure it's going to try to beat through
that door in a second.

02:41:12.994 --> 02:41:18.839
MATT: I'm going to say that you moved up to there
with your movement. All right, I'd say probably over here,

02:41:18.986 --> 02:41:22.693
not right next to the goblins and that will give
you enough range. Okay, so the wall of stone--

02:41:22.693 --> 02:41:23.857
(boom)

02:41:23.857 --> 02:41:26.600
MARISHA: Are there any guards around still? Any
dwarven guards?

02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:30.926
MATT: They are all watching you do this now. They
don't want to put their lives at risk, and you

02:41:30.926 --> 02:41:34.105
guys seem intent on getting into the middle of
this battle, so they are going to sit back and let

02:41:34.105 --> 02:41:35.143
you do it.

02:41:35.186 --> 02:41:40.751
MARISHA: I throw up my wall and turn around and I
say: What's coming?! Tell us! You know what's coming.

02:41:40.751 --> 02:41:41.875
What's coming?!

02:41:42.052 --> 02:41:43.351
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:41:43.351 --> 02:41:46.257
LAURA: Keyleth, you are so hardcore.

02:41:46.257 --> 02:41:47.670
MARISHA: I'm not good at this.

02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:48.976
SAM: You speak goblin?

02:41:48.976 --> 02:41:50.399
MARISHA: Oh, four.

02:41:50.399 --> 02:41:53.101
(laughter and groaning)

02:41:53.101 --> 02:41:55.755
MARISHA: (tearfully) What's coming?

02:41:55.755 --> 02:41:57.730
TALIESIN: Make a pity roll.

02:41:57.730 --> 02:42:01.581
MATT: A very gentle attempt at intimidation,
however, the message gets across. The guards look

02:42:01.581 --> 02:42:04.665
at you, taken off guard.

02:42:04.665 --> 02:42:08.784
MARISHA: We are about to die. It is in your best
interest to tell us.

02:42:08.784 --> 02:42:13.749
MATT: "We don't know! It's been different things.
Strange abominations. It's hard to describe.

02:42:13.749 --> 02:42:17.855
They're put together. Something's making things
down there."

02:42:17.855 --> 02:42:21.954
MARISHA: What kind of things? From where?

02:42:21.954 --> 02:42:25.497
MATT: As they're talking, you hear a (boom)
against the stone.

02:42:25.497 --> 02:42:28.947
TALIESIN: (clicking) Sitting down.

02:42:28.947 --> 02:42:31.500
TRAVIS: I bring out my blade.

02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:36.245
MATT: The stone cracks, and you can see a
noticeable crack and an audible (cracking).

02:42:36.451 --> 02:42:39.927
LIAM: I'm running right now diagonally towards the
wall and I press against the wall.

02:42:39.927 --> 02:42:43.924
LAURA: Oh, good call. I do the same thing on the
other side.

02:42:43.924 --> 02:42:45.697
MATT: Okay, so you come over here. Do you want to
bring Trinket with you?

02:42:45.697 --> 02:42:46.466
LAURA: Yeah!

02:42:46.466 --> 02:42:47.457
MATT: All right.

02:42:47.457 --> 02:42:48.687
TALIESIN: You're all so fancy.

02:42:48.687 --> 02:42:50.161
MARISHA: I cast Stoneskin on myself.

02:42:50.161 --> 02:42:51.962
LAURA: We're stealthing, I'm stealthing.

02:42:51.962 --> 02:42:53.331
MATT: Roll stealth both of you.

02:42:53.331 --> 02:42:55.741
ORION: How tall are the walls? I mean the
ceiling.

02:42:55.741 --> 02:42:59.243
MATT: Oh, the ceiling right now is the rest of
Kraghammer for the most part.

02:42:59.243 --> 02:43:00.462
TRAVIS: Hundreds.

02:43:00.462 --> 02:43:02.818
MATT: Yeah, it is a huge ceiling.

02:43:02.818 --> 02:43:04.910
TRAVIS: What's in the middle? Are those fires?

02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:09.757
MATT: These are braziers here. By the way,
Stoneskin goes, this disappears.

02:43:09.757 --> 02:43:12.345
TRAVIS: The entanglement?

02:43:12.345 --> 02:43:16.830
MATT: Yeah, the entanglement is gone. There are
minecarts, some rocks, there is a smashed cart

02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:21.157
over here from when the ogre barreled through.
This is a piece of stone that rises about 15 feet,

02:43:21.157 --> 02:43:25.785
and these are both braziers for light in the
center of the area. Yeah, it's hundreds and

02:43:25.785 --> 02:43:30.492
hundreds of feet up. You can look up to the very
top of Kraghammer from here.

02:43:30.492 --> 02:43:34.032
ORION: Okay, that's fine.

02:43:34.861 --> 02:43:39.548
MATT: Whatcha got? Well, let's see. Keyleth,
that's your turn, Stoneskin and moving up.

02:43:39.548 --> 02:43:42.698
Anywhere else you want to go? Right now, we're
technically not in combat.

02:43:42.698 --> 02:43:44.452
SAM: Right. We're out of combat.

02:43:44.452 --> 02:43:45.873
MATT: Briefly.

02:43:45.873 --> 02:43:50.486
TALIESIN: I'm breathing deep, taking aim at the
wall, resetting everything.

02:43:50.486 --> 02:43:53.026
MARISHA: Can I move up behind that pillar?

02:43:53.026 --> 02:43:55.530
MATT: Okay.

02:43:55.530 --> 02:43:57.861
TALIESIN: I'm staying far back at the moment.

02:43:57.861 --> 02:44:03.268
MATT: Back here. Both of these goblins-- I'll just
say that you guys end up taking them down. It's

02:44:03.268 --> 02:44:06.923
not even a question. You step on them and crush
them.

02:44:06.923 --> 02:44:10.343
TRAVIS: Are there any dwarves that we can say to
go get Ballsack and bring him down?

02:44:10.343 --> 02:44:12.371
MATT: You can.

02:44:12.371 --> 02:44:13.943
LAURA: Oh yeah, Balgoos! Balgus.

02:44:13.943 --> 02:44:19.644
MATT: Balgus? You tell them, "Get Balgus!" and
they're like, "Who?" Some of them have set

02:44:19.644 --> 02:44:24.106
crossbows up by the way. They're barreling down to
get ready to fire at whatever comes through.

02:44:24.106 --> 02:44:28.016
(impact) Another crack in the wall. You can see
the dust settle as the stone cracks again and a

02:44:28.016 --> 02:44:32.059
large piece at the top tumbles off. The stone
wall's probably not going to hold another impact.

02:44:32.059 --> 02:44:34.882
Anybody else want to move anywhere?

02:44:34.882 --> 02:44:36.343
TALIESIN: Just taking aim.

02:44:36.343 --> 02:44:43.349
SAM: I'll move up to the right near where Grog is.
No one's has taken any damage yet, right?

02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:46.968
MATT: Not currently, no. You guys have had a
pretty clean sweep into this battle, so far.

02:44:46.968 --> 02:44:49.986
SAM: I can't inspire anybody here? Now?

02:44:49.986 --> 02:44:52.493
MATT: You can inspire anybody. Just give them a
dice.

02:44:52.493 --> 02:44:54.425
SAM: Can I inspire everyone?

02:44:54.425 --> 02:44:57.986
MATT: You can spend all your uses to inspire as
many people as you have the uses of it.

02:44:57.986 --> 02:45:00.196
MARISHA: I still have mine that I haven't used
yet.

02:45:00.196 --> 02:45:03.537
SAM: I'll inspire Vex and Vax and Grog.

02:45:03.537 --> 02:45:13.469
SAM: (singing) I think you're really handsome and
nice! You're going to have inspiration dice!

02:45:14.808 --> 02:45:16.925
TRAVIS: Thought you were going to have a little--

02:45:16.925 --> 02:45:21.132
LAURA: I know, some beautiful song for us! Wait,
what for all of us? We all get a d8?

02:45:21.132 --> 02:45:25.532
MATT: Each of you has to have a single d8 dice,
inspiration dice. The bardic inspiration is

02:45:25.699 --> 02:45:29.530
flowing through you, that you can use to add
to an attack roll, not damage.

02:45:29.530 --> 02:45:31.670
You can add it to an attack roll, a saving throw.

02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:34.209
SAM: (plays tune on electric piano app)

02:45:34.209 --> 02:45:39.464
MATT: There you go. That's what a shawm sounds
like, apparently. You can use it on attack roll,

02:45:39.464 --> 02:45:46.494
a saving throw, or an ability check. Any skill.
Tiberius, are you going to stay where you are, are

02:45:46.547 --> 02:45:47.779
you moving anywhere?

02:45:47.779 --> 02:45:49.170
Last chance.

02:45:49.170 --> 02:45:50.637
ORION: Is that cover right there next to me?

02:45:50.637 --> 02:45:51.671
MATT: Right over here? Yeah.

02:45:51.671 --> 02:45:55.730
ORION: I'll get behind the cover. I'm going to
peek out and I'm going to cast Blur.

02:45:55.730 --> 02:45:57.547
MATT: Okay, Stoneskin goes away.

02:45:57.547 --> 02:45:58.727
ORION: I can't do both?

02:45:58.727 --> 02:46:00.824
MATT: Nope. They're both concentration spells.

02:46:00.824 --> 02:46:02.795
ORION: Okay, I leave Stoneskin.

02:46:02.795 --> 02:46:09.404
MATT: Okay, Stoneskin stays on. At which point
(boom) the stone breaks through scattering across

02:46:09.404 --> 02:46:12.897
the ground. Immediately bursting through--

02:46:12.897 --> 02:46:14.615
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

02:46:14.615 --> 02:46:15.749
LAURA: What is it?

02:46:15.749 --> 02:46:19.734
MATT: A bulbous, oversized, naga-like creature.
You've encountered a naga before, which is a large

02:46:19.972 --> 02:46:27.975
serpentine creature with a humanoid head. However,
this one is swollen, it is bulbous. The way it

02:46:27.975 --> 02:46:35.249
moves looks unnatural and it has affixed to it not
one, not three, but five other different colored

02:46:35.249 --> 02:46:42.071
naga heads stitched to its body. It is a seriously
terrible abomination. As it breaks through the

02:46:42.071 --> 02:46:46.363
stone, (hisses and growls) all the heads rear
back.

02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:48.332
MARISHA: Do naga heads do something if you look at
them?

02:46:48.332 --> 02:46:50.037
MATT: We're beginning back at the top of the
initiative order.

02:46:50.037 --> 02:46:50.895
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

02:46:50.895 --> 02:46:55.347
LAURA: Wait! I got a question! My Hunter's Mark,
can I transfer it to that thing or do I have to--

02:46:55.347 --> 02:46:58.707
MATT: Correct, you can, yes.
Because this still part of the encounter.

02:46:58.849 --> 02:47:00.181
LAURA: Sweet!

02:47:00.181 --> 02:47:03.197
MATT: That is now marked with the Hunter's Mark.
Percy, you're up first.

02:47:03.197 --> 02:47:06.398
TALIESIN: Do I have to take new aim or can I have
myself already trained on--

02:47:06.398 --> 02:47:09.111
MATT: You've had a moment to train. You haven't
seen the creature until it just burst out, so it

02:47:09.111 --> 02:47:10.738
would take you a round to aim.

02:47:10.738 --> 02:47:11.911
TALIESIN: I'm taking my round to aim.

02:47:11.911 --> 02:47:14.510
MATT: Okay, so you're aiming. That brings us to
Tiberius.

02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:18.789
ORION: What did you just do?

02:47:18.789 --> 02:47:20.733
TALIESIN: I just took aim. Took aim. Just a gun.

02:47:20.733 --> 02:47:22.753
LAURA: Did we roll initiative again?

02:47:22.893 --> 02:47:24.621
MATT: I'm keeping the same initiative order.

02:47:24.621 --> 02:47:30.494
TALIESIN: This gun doesn't do anything fancy. Just
shoots really far, really hard.

02:47:30.494 --> 02:47:35.066
ORION: Okay! I'll do a Scorching Ray.

02:47:35.066 --> 02:47:40.692
MATT: Scorching Ray, all right. It makes a saving
throw. It does not! Rolled a two, so full damage on it.

02:47:41.196 --> 02:47:47.336
ORION: Two-- four. Let's shoot two of them right
now, right, three of them?

02:47:47.891 --> 02:47:49.630
MATT: It's an aimed ray attack?

02:47:49.630 --> 02:47:50.822
ORION: Yeah.

02:47:50.822 --> 02:47:53.744
MATT: Then you have to roll for the attack. Roll a
d20 and add your--

02:47:55.370 --> 02:47:56.959
TRAVIS: Roll high, roll high.

02:47:56.959 --> 02:47:58.573
MATT: Top of your spell page.

02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:04.660
ORION: Oh! That's 23.

02:48:04.881 --> 02:48:06.378
MATT: 23? 23 hits.

02:48:06.378 --> 02:48:10.685
ORION: Yes, okay. Then that's 2d6. That's 12.

02:48:10.685 --> 02:48:15.125
MATT: 12 points of damage to the naga. That brings
us to--

02:48:15.125 --> 02:48:17.606
ORION: Wait. I roll for the second shot, right?

02:48:17.606 --> 02:48:18.776
MATT: Yeah.

02:48:18.776 --> 02:48:20.477
ORION: Okay, and that's a natural 20.

02:48:20.477 --> 02:48:23.276
(cheering)

02:48:23.286 --> 02:48:26.539
MATT: Okay, so you fire one beam off and it slams
into the side of one of the naga heads. The second

02:48:26.539 --> 02:48:30.531
you bring back and as you do there's a flicker of
arcane instability. His arm shakes as he releases

02:48:30.531 --> 02:48:36.866
the surge of scorching energy as it blasts into
the side of the naga. Also, does not make a saving

02:48:36.866 --> 02:48:39.000
throw again! Roll full damage.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:40.562
TRAVIS: Holy shit, Tiberius.

02:48:40.562 --> 02:48:41.881
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

02:48:41.881 --> 02:48:42.757
ORION: 12.

02:48:42.757 --> 02:48:43.584
MATT: 12?

02:48:43.584 --> 02:48:44.560
ORION: Yeah.

02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:45.744
MATT: Multiplied? Or did you roll a 12?

02:48:45.744 --> 02:48:46.716
ORION: I rolled a 12.

02:48:46.716 --> 02:48:48.369
MATT: 12. Times two. 24 points of damage.

02:48:48.369 --> 02:48:52.032
ORION: Oh! I'm terrible at math! Stay in school,
kids!

02:48:55.910 --> 02:48:59.034
MARISHA: This is a good time to note our charity,
826LA.

02:48:59.034 --> 02:49:03.990
SAM: Not yet. Don't donate yet. Donate next week.

02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:07.446
MATT: Next week, you can donate to then. All
right, so that brings us to the end of Tiberius'

02:49:07.446 --> 02:49:09.319
turn. You want to move at all, are you staying
where you are?

02:49:09.319 --> 02:49:10.491
ORION: I'll stay right here.

02:49:10.491 --> 02:49:11.844
MATT: Grog and Vex, you're up.

02:49:11.844 --> 02:49:12.959
TRAVIS: Ladies first.

02:49:12.959 --> 02:49:18.084
LAURA: Oh! Me! Okay, I'm going to shoot-- oh god,
I didn't realize I was going so fast.

02:49:18.084 --> 02:49:20.359
MATT: What did you roll for stealth, by the way?

02:49:20.359 --> 02:49:21.346
LAURA: What?

02:49:21.346 --> 02:49:22.700
MATT: What did you roll for stealth, by the way?

02:49:22.904 --> 02:49:24.747
LAURA: I rolled a 20 for stealth!

02:49:24.747 --> 02:49:26.610
MATT: Then yeah, he has no idea you're there.

02:49:26.610 --> 02:49:27.557
LAURA: Sweet!

02:49:27.557 --> 02:49:29.242
MATT: He sees the bear going (growling).

02:49:29.242 --> 02:49:36.770
LAURA: Okay. Trinket's going to hang out because I
don't want to-- you know. I'm going to shoot

02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:41.263
Conjure Barrage. No, I'm just going to shoot him
twice.

02:49:41.263 --> 02:49:42.497
MATT: All right, go for it!

02:49:42.497 --> 02:49:43.412
LAURA: All right.

02:49:43.412 --> 02:49:46.018
MATT: Arrow once, arrow twice, Legolas style.

02:49:46.018 --> 02:49:50.220
LAURA: I am going to do the fire arrow thingy at
it.

02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:52.757
MATT: Okay, so using your bowstring.

02:49:52.757 --> 02:49:55.046
LAURA: The blazing bowstring. Thank you,
Tiberius!

02:49:55.046 --> 02:49:59.225
MATT: That he created and crafted! All right so as
you pull the second arrow out you nock it. As you

02:49:59.225 --> 02:50:02.077
let it, go it bursts into flames arcing halfway
through the air.

02:50:02.077 --> 02:50:03.051
LAURA: Okay.

02:50:03.051 --> 02:50:03.963
MATT: What was your to hit roll on that?

02:50:03.963 --> 02:50:04.750
LAURA: 21?

02:50:04.750 --> 02:50:06.029
MATT: 21 hits!

02:50:07.659 --> 02:50:11.568
LAURA: Oh wait, that's four plus seven is 11.

02:50:11.703 --> 02:50:13.557
SAM: Don't forget your inspiration!

02:50:13.557 --> 02:50:15.064
MATT: Well inspiration dice is to hit.

02:50:15.064 --> 02:50:16.218
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:50:16.218 --> 02:50:17.189
LAURA: 11.

02:50:17.189 --> 02:50:18.491
MATT: 11 points of damage.

02:50:18.491 --> 02:50:24.454
LAURA: For the first one, plus for the blazing
bowstring I can turn any arrow into a flaming

02:50:24.454 --> 02:50:32.723
arrow, doing additional ten fire damage. I'll roll
that right now, which is this. Which is a seven!

02:50:32.723 --> 02:50:37.149
MATT: An additional seven, so 18 total damage and
that arrow (impact) in the side of its body. One

02:50:37.149 --> 02:50:41.369
of the serpent heads reels back from the pain. It
begins snatching at where the arrow's now

02:50:41.369 --> 02:50:43.521
protruding from it, trying to break it off.

02:50:43.521 --> 02:50:45.562
LAURA: Then I'm going to roll again!

02:50:46.913 --> 02:50:48.392
That's a 24!

02:50:48.392 --> 02:50:49.769
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:50:49.769 --> 02:50:51.472
LAURA: Awesome. That's an eight.

02:50:51.472 --> 02:50:52.817
MATT: Grog, you're on deck.

02:50:52.817 --> 02:50:54.783
LAURA: Seven plus seven is 14!

02:50:54.783 --> 02:50:59.885
MATT: 14 damage, all right. Both arrows sink into
it. Definitely piercing through the scales a

02:50:59.885 --> 02:51:03.943
little bit, but not sticking too deeply into its
body; it's definitely a hearty creature. Grog,

02:51:03.943 --> 02:51:04.999
you're up!

02:51:04.999 --> 02:51:08.957
TRAVIS: Right, I would like to run around the
other side of the rock, raging, spit flying out my

02:51:08.957 --> 02:51:14.835
of my mouth! I would like to use the chain of
returning, also crafted by Tiberius, attach it to

02:51:14.835 --> 02:51:18.706
the end of the greataxe, and throw it from where I
am at the snake.

02:51:18.706 --> 02:51:20.081
ORION: Yeah!

02:51:20.081 --> 02:51:25.700
MATT: He comes running around, rears back, and
takes his double-handed great axe and lobs it overhand.

02:51:25.870 --> 02:51:30.123
The chain, that's wrapped around your wrist,
keeping it attached to you, in some degree. Go

02:51:30.123 --> 02:51:31.993
ahead and roll for the attack.

02:51:32.778 --> 02:51:34.406
TRAVIS: Eight, nine, 17!

02:51:34.406 --> 02:51:36.268
MATT: 17? It just hits!

02:51:36.268 --> 02:51:41.142
TRAVIS: All right, nice. That is 15.

02:51:41.142 --> 02:51:47.200
MATT: 15 points of damage. The axe embeds itself
pretty deeply into the torso.

02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:49.243
LAURA: Oh! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark.

02:51:49.243 --> 02:51:50.895
MATT: Roll Hunter's Mark damage right now.

02:51:50.895 --> 02:51:52.684
LAURA: Thank you, chatroom!

02:51:54.116 --> 02:51:54.987
Six!

02:51:54.987 --> 02:51:57.180
MATT: Six? Awesome. Six damage. All right.

02:51:57.180 --> 02:52:00.971
TRAVIS: This says, "An athletics-strength check is
required to pull the weapon free, the DC 12?"

02:52:00.971 --> 02:52:03.913
MATT: Go ahead and roll an athletics check.

02:52:04.623 --> 02:52:05.549
TRAVIS: 12.

02:52:05.757 --> 02:52:07.227
MATT: Roll a d20.

02:52:07.227 --> 02:52:08.314
TRAVIS: Oh, a d20.

02:52:08.314 --> 02:52:09.670
MATT: It's a DC 12.

02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:13.638
TRAVIS: Shit. Balls. Taint. Five.

02:52:13.811 --> 02:52:14.951
MATT: Plus--

02:52:14.951 --> 02:52:16.068
TRAVIS: Plus what?

02:52:16.068 --> 02:52:17.317
MATT: Plus your athletics!

02:52:17.317 --> 02:52:21.525
TRAVIS: Oh! That's bound to be good. Seven! It's
12!

02:52:21.525 --> 02:52:23.330
MATT: 12 is the DC! So yeah!

02:52:23.330 --> 02:52:24.603
TRAVIS: (elated laughter)

02:52:24.603 --> 02:52:28.489
MATT: You pull back the chain and as you do, the
blade is resisting, it's stuck in the torso and it

02:52:28.489 --> 02:52:31.870
actually (whoosh) and flies back, and you barely
catch it.

02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:33.434
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter)

02:52:33.434 --> 02:52:35.205
MARISHA: I love your joy sounds!

02:52:35.615 --> 02:52:39.054
TRAVIS: Meant to do that! Meant to do that of
course.

02:52:39.074 --> 02:52:40.636
MATT: Now it's its turn.

02:52:40.636 --> 02:52:41.933
LAURA: Oh no!

02:52:41.933 --> 02:52:43.521
MATT: (bursts of wind)

02:52:43.521 --> 02:52:45.410
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on!

02:52:45.410 --> 02:52:47.900
SAM: What? Why me? No, that's not me.

02:52:47.900 --> 02:52:51.859
MATT: For its size, when it moves, it moves in a
burst of lightning energy. It's too fast for its

02:52:51.859 --> 02:52:54.729
corpulent form.

02:52:54.729 --> 02:53:02.289
As it goes behind to Keyleth and Tiberius, it
makes an attack with each of its five heads. Two

02:53:02.289 --> 02:53:06.516
on Tiberius, three on Keyleth. Remember, you guys
have Stoneskin, so I believe you have resistance

02:53:06.516 --> 02:53:07.951
against damage, right?

02:53:07.951 --> 02:53:09.424
ORION: Oh yes, I do.

02:53:09.424 --> 02:53:11.153
MATT: All right. So. Against Keyleth, it's a
natural 20.

02:53:11.153 --> 02:53:13.341
ALL: Oh no!

02:53:13.341 --> 02:53:18.183
MATT: That's a 12 plus seven, that's going to be a
19 to hit?

02:53:18.183 --> 02:53:20.227
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:53:21.205 --> 02:53:22.629
MATT: Natural 20 again.

02:53:22.629 --> 02:53:24.433
MARISHA: What the fuck!

02:53:24.433 --> 02:53:26.132
MATT: Two critical hits, and a hit on you.

02:53:26.132 --> 02:53:27.746
TRAVIS: What is this bullshit?

02:53:27.746 --> 02:53:32.345
MATT: On Tiberius, that's a 22 to hit and a 13 to
hit.

02:53:32.345 --> 02:53:33.986
ORION: One does, one does not.

02:53:33.986 --> 02:53:38.378
MATT: Okay, cool. Against Keyleth, you take--

02:53:38.378 --> 02:53:40.495
MARISHA: I'm glad I cast Stoneskin.

02:53:40.495 --> 02:53:42.279
MATT: I know. So you take half damage for these.
Which is fine.

02:53:42.279 --> 02:53:43.234
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:53:43.234 --> 02:53:46.741
MATT: That's two plus four, that's six, damage
halved, you take three damage. Oh, sorry. Three

02:53:46.741 --> 02:53:50.811
multiplied by two because it's a critical. So you
take six damage from the first strike.

02:53:50.811 --> 02:53:53.435
LAURA: That's nothing! Six damage.

02:53:53.435 --> 02:53:58.968
MATT: Not too bad. You take seven damage from the
second strike, and another six damage from the 3rd

02:53:58.968 --> 02:54:05.062
strike. Actually, it would have been six, four and
six. Because you have resistance on the damage

02:54:05.062 --> 02:54:07.058
because of Stoneskin.

02:54:07.058 --> 02:54:08.541
MARISHA: Six, four and six?

02:54:08.541 --> 02:54:13.490
MATT: Yes. However, make a constitution saving
throw. As venom from the fangs of the naga begin

02:54:13.542 --> 02:54:15.578
to pulse into your bloodstream.

02:54:15.578 --> 02:54:19.681
MARISHA: I should have taken the poison
resistance. He talked me out of it.

02:54:22.119 --> 02:54:23.895
What am I--constitution.

02:54:23.895 --> 02:54:25.923
MATT: Yeah, constitution saving throw.

02:54:27.073 --> 02:54:28.501
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:54:29.837 --> 02:54:33.418
MATT: Natural one? Natural one on the constitution
saving throw.

02:54:33.418 --> 02:54:34.750
LAURA: Oh no!

02:54:34.750 --> 02:54:36.174
MARISHA: It's a bad day.

02:54:36.174 --> 02:54:38.924
MATT: You feel this burning pain pulse into your
bloodstream, as your whole body doubles over from

02:54:38.924 --> 02:54:40.578
the pain.

02:54:40.578 --> 02:54:42.255
SAM: Keyleth dies in episode one.

02:54:42.255 --> 02:54:44.985
MATT: You suffer 31 points of poison damage.

02:54:44.985 --> 02:54:47.554
MARISHA: 31, on top of the six, four and six?

02:54:47.554 --> 02:54:48.437
MATT: Yep.

02:54:48.437 --> 02:54:49.962
TRAVIS: Are you okay?

02:54:49.962 --> 02:54:52.874
MATT: The poison damage is not halved because it
is not a physical attack on your body.

02:54:52.874 --> 02:54:54.202
LAURA: Is Keyleth unconscious?

02:54:54.202 --> 02:54:55.584
SAM: No, she's okay.

02:54:55.784 --> 02:55:04.554
MATT: Tiberius you take 13 points of damage halved
by Stoneskin so you take a total of seven. Also

02:55:04.554 --> 02:55:07.906
make a constitution saving throw.

02:55:14.124 --> 02:55:15.351
Whatcha got?

02:55:15.351 --> 02:55:16.430
ORION: It's a 16.

02:55:16.430 --> 02:55:21.009
MATT: 16, you manage to physically resist the
poison in your system. You feel that slight tinge,

02:55:21.165 --> 02:55:27.280
the muscles tense, but then your dragonborn form
begins to shrug off the effect of the venom.

02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:29.832
ORION: Can I turn to him and blow fire out of my
nostrils?

02:55:29.832 --> 02:55:30.863
MATT: Sure.

02:55:30.863 --> 02:55:32.159
ORION: That's what I do.

02:55:32.159 --> 02:55:35.519
MATT: True dragonborn challenge. That brings us to
Vax.

02:55:35.519 --> 02:55:38.379
LIAM: Okay, I start jogging backwards.

02:55:38.379 --> 02:55:41.342
MARISHA: Took me down to 16 hit points.

02:55:41.342 --> 02:55:44.014
LIAM: Can I sneak attack while prone?

02:55:44.014 --> 02:55:48.354
MATT: You're stealthed currently, so you would
technically get a sneak attack, but you have to be

02:55:48.354 --> 02:55:51.161
in melee for you to get the other bonus. It would
be sneak attack for this damage if you were to

02:55:51.161 --> 02:55:54.061
roll or if you were to throw a dagger at it, you
would get the sneak attack.

02:55:54.061 --> 02:55:56.709
LIAM: Okay, so that means one throw instead of
two?

02:55:56.709 --> 02:55:58.728
MATT: You can throw both daggers at it.

02:55:58.728 --> 02:56:01.210
LIAM: All right. I feel so inspired by Scanlan's
bardic tunes--

02:56:01.210 --> 02:56:02.784
SAM: (singing) Yeah!

02:56:02.784 --> 02:56:04.813
MATT: You can add it after you make the roll by
the way.

02:56:04.813 --> 02:56:07.153
LAURA: If you do a really good roll then you don't
need it.

02:56:07.153 --> 02:56:10.709
LIAM: Okay, 19 plus 11 is 30.

02:56:10.709 --> 02:56:13.640
MATT: Because you're a rogue, isn't that critical
for you?

02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:15.237
LIAM: Yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:56:15.237 --> 02:56:18.125
MATT: Two criticals!

02:56:18.125 --> 02:56:24.365
LIAM: The other one, the other one is a 16 plus,
plus-- is a 26.

02:56:24.365 --> 02:56:28.838
MATT: That also hits. You chuck both daggers out,
they both arc around.

02:56:28.838 --> 02:56:31.038
You're used to throwing around--

02:56:32.223 --> 02:56:36.523
LIAM: I meant to say I was aiming at its eye, the
main head's eye.

02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:38.652
LAURA: No, you should've said that first.

02:56:38.652 --> 02:56:40.872
MATT: For flavor it's fine. Just go ahead, it's
fine.

02:56:40.872 --> 02:56:42.346
LIAM: All right, four.

02:56:42.346 --> 02:56:43.304
LAURA: Four!

02:56:43.304 --> 02:56:53.298
LIAM: (counting)

02:56:53.778 --> 02:56:59.291
20. 20 times--is 40 plus four.
44, that's the first dagger?

02:56:59.291 --> 02:57:00.554
MATT: Yeah, 44 damage.

02:57:00.554 --> 02:57:01.598
LIAM: 44.

02:57:01.598 --> 02:57:02.829
TRAVIS: Damn!

02:57:02.829 --> 02:57:04.229
MATT: Rogues, man.

02:57:04.229 --> 02:57:06.749
MARISHA: Help me. Help!

02:57:06.749 --> 02:57:09.077
LAURA: That's just one dagger?

02:57:09.077 --> 02:57:12.101
LIAM: That's just one. Four plus two is six. Is
that sneak attack? No.

02:57:12.101 --> 02:57:14.189
MATT: No, only one sneak attack per turn.

02:57:14.189 --> 02:57:15.153
LIAM: Okay.

02:57:15.153 --> 02:57:17.069
LAURA: 40 and then six on the other one.

02:57:17.118 --> 02:57:22.412
MATT: One actually hit one of the heads, one of
the various naga heads directly into its face. As

02:57:22.412 --> 02:57:29.157
it does it goes through both eyes and you can see
it begin reeling from the attack. It's looking

02:57:29.157 --> 02:57:34.460
pretty rough, actually. The stitches beginning to
come apart at some of the seams and you can see a

02:57:34.460 --> 02:57:38.760
black ichorous liquid spill out from some of the
suture marks.

02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:42.944
LIAM: Just a reminder the daggers, folks, blink
back to the belt on my waist.

02:57:42.944 --> 02:57:49.937
MATT: Because magic. Magic rogue shit. Keyleth,
you're up.

02:57:49.937 --> 02:57:51.662
LAURA: Kill him!

02:57:51.662 --> 02:58:00.147
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm really upset, really
hurting. Out of anger I take my staff and I go

02:58:00.147 --> 02:58:05.319
(bam) and I crack and do Thunderwave pushing him
back 15 feet.

02:58:05.319 --> 02:58:10.088
MATT: All right. Makes the saving throw. He gets
pushed back, so he takes damage, just half damage.

02:58:10.238 --> 02:58:11.877
MARISHA: Okay, 2d8.

02:58:15.424 --> 02:58:20.002
MATT: As you're setting up your gun it gets
slammed right point blank to you.

02:58:20.002 --> 02:58:22.741
MARISHA: Oh sorry. It takes four damage.

02:58:22.741 --> 02:58:25.005
MATT: Four damage, all righty.

02:58:25.815 --> 02:58:29.947
MARISHA: Then I'm going to turn into an eagle.

02:58:30.519 --> 02:58:32.997
SAM: (laughs) As one does.

02:58:33.061 --> 02:58:40.251
MATT: We'll say for that, because I forgot to
bring an eagle, you're now a-- (eagle sounds)

02:58:41.228 --> 02:58:45.488
MARISHA: And I fly away.

02:58:45.488 --> 02:58:47.177
TRAVIS: Away.

02:58:47.177 --> 02:58:50.220
(laughter)

02:58:50.220 --> 02:58:51.870
MARISHA: Far, far, away.

02:58:51.870 --> 02:58:53.953
ORION: Where are you going?!

02:58:53.953 --> 02:58:56.427
SAM: Tell our story, Keyleth.

02:58:57.420 --> 02:58:58.890
MATT: That's pretty great.

02:58:58.890 --> 02:59:02.149
MARISHA: Then I cry in the corner and rock back
and forth a little bit. That's my turn.

02:59:02.455 --> 02:59:04.920
MATT: I forgot to mention you actually take half
damage for the saving throw for the venom so you

02:59:04.920 --> 02:59:08.645
still would've taken 14 points of poison damage,
so mark that.

02:59:08.645 --> 02:59:10.097
ORION: Okay.

02:59:10.097 --> 02:59:13.366
MATT: It is half damage on a save. That brings us
to Scanlan.

02:59:13.366 --> 02:59:16.288
SAM: Can I bonus inspire myself?

02:59:18.891 --> 02:59:26.526
MATT: Because you're Scanlan I'll say, yes. You
have such a high opinion of yourself that even you

02:59:26.526 --> 02:59:29.559
could inspire yourself. So yes, why not.

02:59:29.559 --> 02:59:35.991
SAM: (singing) It would help me to acquire some
dice to inspire. (speaking) I inspire myself first

02:59:35.991 --> 02:59:38.946
and move five feet back so I'm on the same row as
him.

02:59:38.946 --> 02:59:40.029
MATT: There?

02:59:40.029 --> 02:59:41.084
SAM: Not that far.

02:59:41.084 --> 02:59:42.101
MATT: There.

02:59:42.101 --> 02:59:44.419
SAM: Yes. Them I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at
him.

02:59:44.706 --> 02:59:47.839
MATT: Okay! Straight line that way?

02:59:47.839 --> 02:59:49.502
SAM: Straight line, that way.

02:59:49.502 --> 02:59:52.322
MATT: You don't have to roll to hit. You just roll
damage on that. I make a saving throw.

02:59:52.322 --> 02:59:53.970
SAM: Oh! I didn't even need to inspire.

02:59:53.970 --> 02:59:56.563
MATT: What's your DC on the spell? Top of your
spell list.

02:59:56.563 --> 02:59:57.726
ORION: 17.

02:59:57.726 --> 02:59:59.092
SAM: Thank you.

02:59:59.092 --> 03:00:02.940
MATT: 17? That's a failure on its saving throw. Go
ahead and roll 8d6.

03:00:02.940 --> 03:00:05.936
LAURA: 8d6?! Kill him!

03:00:06.704 --> 03:00:10.134
MATT: Bards. Gets spells from other classes.

03:00:10.134 --> 03:00:13.374
TRAVIS: If you kill, I will take a shit on this
table.

03:00:13.374 --> 03:00:16.034
SAM: (counting)

03:00:16.034 --> 03:00:17.958
LIAM: It's gone.

03:00:18.838 --> 03:00:19.698
SAM: 24!

03:00:19.976 --> 03:00:21.709
MATT: 24 points of lightning damage.

03:00:21.837 --> 03:00:24.382
SAM: Yes. (sings a high-pitched note)

03:00:24.382 --> 03:00:25.828
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:00:26.057 --> 03:00:30.585
(yelling)

03:00:30.585 --> 03:00:32.275
MARISHA: Wait! Is this the first time you've--

03:00:32.275 --> 03:00:35.089
SAM: I've never killed anything before!

03:00:35.089 --> 03:00:38.087
TRAVIS: Never killed anything in two years!

03:00:38.087 --> 03:00:41.361
LIAM: For the people at home, we live to hear Matt
say:

03:00:41.361 --> 03:00:43.532
ALL: "How do you want to do this?"

03:00:43.532 --> 03:00:47.556
MATT: I let the player describe their victory. As
you sing to yourself to bolster your arcane

03:00:47.556 --> 03:00:51.891
energy, you release a shear bolt of energy. How do
you want to do this?

03:00:51.891 --> 03:01:00.494
SAM: The bolt of lightning begins in its tail and
works its way up through its spine, slowly but

03:01:00.494 --> 03:01:08.489
painfully torturing it as it slowly, slowly feels
the effect coursing through its evil body.

03:01:09.219 --> 03:01:14.989
MATT: Because of your bardic ability to actually
shape sound from an arcane standpoint, a lightning

03:01:14.989 --> 03:01:20.166
bolt should be an instant flash of arcane energy,
you actually cause it to crawl. You control it as

03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:25.546
it begins to cascade up the torso of this horrible
abomination. As it does you can see the bolts

03:01:25.546 --> 03:01:31.063
splinter and destroy each suture wound as each of
its heads begins to slough off the rest of the

03:01:31.063 --> 03:01:35.476
torso until nothing is left but the single head
screaming into the air. As the bolt makes its way

03:01:35.476 --> 03:01:40.873
up the neck, its eyes burst out in a blast of
energy. The body falls limp to the ground.

03:01:40.873 --> 03:01:43.807
SAM: Can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an
"S?"

03:01:44.583 --> 03:01:49.538
MATT: A Scanlan-shaped lightning bolt is burned
into the torso of the strange naga beast.

03:01:51.078 --> 03:01:54.422
TRAVIS: Well done, Scanlan, well done!

03:01:54.643 --> 03:01:59.581
MATT: The dust settles, the adrenaline still
pumping in your system, Scanlan. All the rest of

03:01:59.581 --> 03:02:03.207
the dwarves begin stepping down, putting their
crossbows down, looking down at the little gnome

03:02:03.207 --> 03:02:12.073
that created a storm from its hands. One of them
pats him on the shoulder and goes, "Well done."

03:02:12.073 --> 03:02:16.039
SAM: Thank you. Just promise me you'll that tell
Pike about this.

03:02:17.903 --> 03:02:19.332
MATT: "Okay?"

03:02:19.332 --> 03:02:21.517
SAM: Because it was really cool, right?

03:02:21.517 --> 03:02:22.885
MATT: "That was pretty cool."

03:02:22.885 --> 03:02:24.326
SAM: Okay, good.

03:02:24.326 --> 03:02:28.171
MATT: All the dwarves look into the tunnel that it
came from and the one that you spoke to earlier

03:02:28.171 --> 03:02:32.969
goes, "So that's the kind of thing that's been
coming out of there."

03:02:32.969 --> 03:02:34.399
LAURA: Lovely.

03:02:34.399 --> 03:02:36.078
MARISHA: Thanks for the heads up.

03:02:36.078 --> 03:02:37.664
TALIESIN: That was really helpful.

03:02:37.664 --> 03:02:39.378
MATT: We'll go ahead and leave the game there for
the night.

03:02:39.378 --> 03:02:41.420
(cheering)

03:02:41.420 --> 03:02:47.660
MATT: Folks, well done. Hope you guys had fun
watching our first ever Critical Role. That was a

03:02:47.660 --> 03:02:52.167
good time so we'll be here next week on Thursday.
7:00, though. Today was a special early edition

03:02:52.167 --> 03:02:55.031
because all of Geek & Sundry's going to South by
Southwest.

03:02:55.031 --> 03:02:56.300
ZAC: Good job, dude!

03:02:56.300 --> 03:02:57.910
MATT: Dude, thank you, Zac!

03:02:57.910 --> 03:03:04.069
ZAC: This is so much fun. This is the most fun
I've had all week now until I die of stress behind

03:03:04.069 --> 03:03:05.525
the camera.

03:03:05.525 --> 03:03:08.380
MATT: Good! That's good.

03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:14.573
ZAC: Guys, I hate to end it so abruptly but we're
actually packing up the cameras that are filming

03:03:14.573 --> 03:03:20.749
me now, our unit, everything, lights, and getting
on a plane and heading to South by Southwest. We

03:03:20.749 --> 03:03:26.025
may stream tomorrow, we may not, we're flying
blind, we'll see what stuff looks like when we get

03:03:26.025 --> 03:03:31.766
there. Thank you guys so much and we'll be back
next week, 7:00pm. Next week guys, it's going to

03:03:31.766 --> 03:03:32.542
be great.

03:03:32.542 --> 03:03:34.455
MATT: Thank you all for coming!
