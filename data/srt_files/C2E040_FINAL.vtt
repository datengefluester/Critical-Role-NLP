NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.288
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.478 --> 00:00:09.110
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons. I know it's November 1st and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.473
Halloween was last night, but that's bullshit
because we would have missed Halloween, so we're

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:15.649
doing it anyway.

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.282
TRAVIS: Yeah! Halloween's when you want it to be!

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:24.422
MATT: Apparently I have a type when it comes to
Halloween costumes, but after having enough people

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:28.371
send me pictures of new Dante, going, "He looks
like you!" I was like, "Fuck it. I'm going to

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:35.977
"embrace it." So yes, I guess we'll go around and
introduce our costumes, because it sounds like fun

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:45.626
right now. I'm Dante from Devil May Cry 5. The
best I could do in one week's time, most of which

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:48.495
was spent in London. What about you?

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:53.950
TALIESIN: I'm Sherlock Holmes, because that's the
best I could do in two hours' time, after figuring

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.327
out that I was supposed to do this while working
on another project.

00:00:57.327 --> 00:00:59.103
SAM: I am ketchup.

00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:04.267
(laughter)

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.497
TRAVIS: Wasn't there face paint that could help
complete the look?

00:01:06.497 --> 00:01:09.796
SAM: Nope, this is it. Nine dollars.

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:11.373
MATT: Liam.

00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:16.780
LIAM: (as Mickey Mouse) Ha ha. I'm Kylo Ren. Ha
ha.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.048
MATT: Perfect!

00:01:18.048 --> 00:01:20.560
LIAM: (as Mickey Mouse) Ooh! Sorry, dad.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.749
MARISHA: I'm Lisa Frank Castle.

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.674
TALIESIN: By far the most put-together costume at
this table.

00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:29.597
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:31.285
MATT: And Travis.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.155
TRAVIS: I'm the bargain bin. I had a cowboy hat.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:36.611
SAM: I gave you some gloves.

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:39.517
TRAVIS: I think these belong to an M&M character?

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:41.639
SAM: Yeah, or Pac-man. I'm not sure.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:42.940
TRAVIS: Ey!

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.507
(laughter)

00:01:44.507 --> 00:01:46.255
MARISHA: You look like you're trying to sell baked
beans.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.946
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was a panda last night. I didn't
have a fucking costume. I wasn't wearing that

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.435
again. That shit was hot.

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:58.794
MATT: Perfect. Sadly, we're missing Laura Bailey
tonight. She is off doing rehearsals for BlizzCon

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.048
tomorrow. I will be there as well both days, so
those who are watching or are on the virtual

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:10.046
ticket, check it out, because there's some fun
stuff going on. Before we get into the rest of our

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:13.852
announcements, first we have two fantastic
sponsors tonight. The first of which is the

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.105
fantastic Tor Books. Liam!

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:26.379
LIAM: (air hissing) (as Kylo Ren) I have come from
a galaxy very far away to talk to you about Tor

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.980
Books. Tor Books is America's largest--

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.398
(laughter)

00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:41.517
LIAM: This is serious. Largest publisher of
science fiction and fantasy. From Tor Books comes

00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:49.402
Oathbringer, book three of The Stormlight
Archives. Humanity faces a new desolation with the

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:57.581
return of the Voidbringers, Matthew. A foe with
numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.

00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:03.547
Find Oathbringer out now in paperback wherever
books are sold. For more of the latest science

00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:15.575
fiction and fantasy releases, follow @torbooks.
That's T-O-R Books. I'm going to resume doing

00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:22.949
unspeakable things. (air hissing) Tor Books.

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.317
MATT: Kylo Walken?

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:28.367
SAM: I think that was Jackie Mason.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:33.912
LIAM: Listen to him again, he has a very subtle
Brooklyn accent always.

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:37.858
MATT: You actually directed him, so you would
know.

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:40.096
LIAM: I did one time, yes.

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:41.541
MATT: Anyway.

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:44.064
(laughter)

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:48.075
LIAM: He was great! It was a great project! I love
Star Wars! I'm dressed as him!

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.160
(laughter)

00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:57.318
MATT: Thank you, Liam. Our fantastic returning
second sponsor for tonight are our friends at D&D

00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:58.742
Beyond. Sam.

00:03:58.742 --> 00:04:04.873
SAM: If you have somehow still not checked out D&D
Beyond, it is the official digital toolset for

00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:09.706
Dungeons & Dragons. Everything is there at your
fingertips: the source books, the digital

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:17.044
character sheets, the homebrew content creation!
Go to dndbeyond.com now to check out how easy they

00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:24.270
make playing D&D. Now, you guys all know that
first and foremost, I am a filmmaker, and I am

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.304
proud to announce that tonight I have teamed with
D&D Beyond to create my first ever foray into

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:39.417
stop-motion animation. I don't want to say it's
better than The Nightmare Before Christmas, but

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:45.721
I'll let you guys say that. Wait until you see it
for yourself. Let's roll my film.

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:47.808
MATT: Oh my god, what have you done?!

00:04:47.808 --> 00:05:14.894
SAM (VO): (triumphant humming)

00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:19.204
(laughter)

00:05:19.204 --> 00:05:31.310
SAM: Thank you. Any film like this is a
collaborative process. I have so many people I

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.060
want to thank. I'll try to keep it quick. Our
cinematographer Giuseppe Fister, wonderful work,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.321
powerful work. Our gaffer Blumpkin Styles, the
most daring in the biz. Our sound mixer Randy

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:47.714
Cockburn, didn't think you could pull it off like
that. Best boy Mike Litoris, I can't believe I

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:54.569
found you. Our producer Willy Stroker, you've got
a finger on the pulse, sir. Casting director Ima

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.556
Dumas, and of course my agents at CAA, Amanda
Hump, Keifer Comings, Dickson Beavers, Harry

00:06:01.556 --> 00:06:08.991
Sacks, Otto Beemakraken, Wilma Fingerdo, Irma
Wanker, Drew P. Winer-- oh, I'm sorry, Drew P.

00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:16.758
Wiener, thank you all for believing in this
project. Also, my inspiration, my mentor, Hugh

00:06:16.758 --> 00:06:24.426
Janus, Mr. Janus, wherever he is. I think Hugh
Janus is smiling down on all of us tonight. And of

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:31.492
course, D&D Beyond, we did it guys! It took three
years, but we did it. Thank you.

00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:38.935
MATT: Well done. Thank you, Sam, and thank you,
our friends at D&D Beyond, for making this happen

00:06:38.935 --> 00:06:40.947
on a weekly basis.

00:06:40.947 --> 00:06:43.586
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were at a Halloween party
yesterday. How did you have time for that?

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:46.016
MARISHA: I know. We were in London two days ago.

00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:47.904
TRAVIS: Three years it's been in the works.

00:06:47.904 --> 00:06:50.356
SAM: Yeah, it's been in post for months.

00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:57.098
MATT: I'm so glad that Dreamworks was willing to
work with you based on how much Disney you do.

00:06:57.098 --> 00:07:05.839
TALIESIN: Yeah. Also, I forgot I just announced
I'm going to be at Loscon November 23rd through

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:11.454
25th. So if you're in LA and want to check out the
convention, I'll be hanging out there and talking

00:07:11.454 --> 00:07:18.386
about D&D and voiceover and all sorts of things
like that. Loscon: L-O-S-C-O-N. That's what I've got.

00:07:18.386 --> 00:07:25.961
MATT: Find Taliesin there. Our final episode of
this batch of Between the Sheets aired this past

00:07:26.222 --> 00:07:33.208
Monday and is now available on YouTube, where our
fantastic host Brian W. Foster talks to me. It's a

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:42.834
bit of an emotional one, but I hope you enjoy it.
Check it out on youtube.com/criticalrole and I

00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:47.810
think that ends this batch. We'll be back very
soon with the next batch of new guests and new

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.663
stories with our fantastic host.

00:07:49.663 --> 00:07:55.362
SAM: It was really good, Matt. You did a great
job. I watched it on the cab ride home from the airport.

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:56.381
MATT: Oh shit, thank you.

00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:58.257
SAM: It was so good. Amazing.

00:07:58.257 --> 00:08:02.441
MATT: Thank you. I didn't expect it to get as deep
as it did but here we are. Anyway, hope you enjoy

00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:09.305
it. The next episode of All Work, No Play will
debut this Friday at twitch.tv/criticalrole at

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.098
7PM Pacific Time. This week, Liam and Sam learn how
to fire spin with our fantastic, our own, my wife,

00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:17.212
Marisha Ray.

00:08:17.212 --> 00:08:18.572
SAM: Yay!

00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:21.113
TRAVIS: You survived, clearly. Somehow.

00:08:21.113 --> 00:08:22.801
LIAM: Oh, the burn.

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.440
SAM: You were great, Marisha.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.601
MARISHA: It was fun. I was honored.

00:08:27.601 --> 00:08:32.055
MATT: I'm excited to see it. I've only seen bits
and pieces, and it's pretty absurd.

00:08:32.055 --> 00:08:33.652
SAM: Your wife shines.

00:08:33.652 --> 00:08:35.497
LIAM: But only from the fire burns.

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:37.899
MARISHA: I was going to say, it was from the
flames.

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:41.583
MATT: Yeah, failure to ignite. Check it out this
Friday at 7PM Pacific. Travis, you have something

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:42.461
to talk about?

00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:46.824
TRAVIS: Yes! Through the month of November, we are
raising money for my favorite charity: Operation

00:08:46.824 --> 00:08:55.328
Supply Drop! They are amazing. OSD has helped over
750,000 members of the military community with

00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:59.771
supply drops. They have initiatives, they have job
training, they have skill workshops for people

00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:05.244
that are going from active military work through
their transition into civilian life, and they just

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:10.819
touched so many people. I love this organization.
I've been following them for years. If we hit our

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:20.250
25,000 dollar goal, we're going to host a special
first-person shooter stream with me! Yeah. I used

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:26.027
to be good. I'm not so much anymore since baby
days, but I'm going to try. I'm going to have a

00:09:26.027 --> 00:09:26.780
montage.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.533
LIAM: Deep down that rabbit hole for years. Oh my
god. I liked playing with you. Never won, but I

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:32.513
enjoyed the process.

00:09:32.513 --> 00:09:36.059
TRAVIS: Thank you! Right? It's all about the
commentary that happens, right? If we hit that

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:43.168
goal we will do that. Details and to donate, you
can see everything at critrole.com/osd.

00:09:43.168 --> 00:09:45.627
LIAM: Amazing.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:52.368
MATT: Thanks, Travis. Daylight savings time hits
the US this week, so make sure for those that are

00:09:52.368 --> 00:09:57.137
outside of the US, as far as times you can check
out the shows and the rest of our content, go to

00:09:57.137 --> 00:10:03.866
wheniscriticalrole.com for updated air times in
your timezone. Keep an eye out on that.

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:06.589
LIAM: We're going to time change again here?

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:08.195
MATT: Yes. We gain an hour.

00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:09.929
TRAVIS: You fall back.

00:10:09.929 --> 00:10:12.859
MARISHA: We sleep longer.

00:10:12.859 --> 00:10:21.519
MATT: We gain an hour. They're archaic,
unnecessary means of changing our times each year.

00:10:22.048 --> 00:10:25.253
TALIESIN: We're getting two daylight savings
times, because we had one in London too. So we get

00:10:25.253 --> 00:10:27.973
two hours. We should travel the world.

00:10:27.973 --> 00:10:29.676
MATT: I don't think that works that way.

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:31.012
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure it does.

00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:32.702
MATT: You might be right.

00:10:32.702 --> 00:10:35.431
TALIESIN: I want a judgement call on that.

00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:36.575
MATT: Fair enough.

00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:39.078
LIAM: Jet lag absolutely destroyed any gain we
got.

00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:41.258
TALIESIN: I know. I'm well aware.

00:10:41.258 --> 00:10:45.111
MATT: Last but not least, I want to thank all of
our fantastic European critters and beyond who

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:54.839
came out to MCM London this past weekend. Our
first European convention and it was magnificent.

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:01.576
The turnout was insane. You guys broke MCM London,
confusing all sorts of other guests about what the

00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:08.138
hell this thing is. I loved the fact that Kit
Buss, our official artist from the first campaign,

00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:13.226
had a far longer line than Frank Miller the entire
weekend. It was pretty fantastic.

00:11:13.226 --> 00:11:15.077
TRAVIS: All the love in the world to Frank
Miller.

00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:16.883
MARISHA: The legendary Frank Miller.

00:11:16.883 --> 00:11:18.084
TRAVIS: That is crazy.

00:11:18.084 --> 00:11:23.989
LIAM: Also lots of love to Kit Buss who's a good
friend of the show, and a good friend of ours, and

00:11:23.989 --> 00:11:28.284
it was so cool meeting you guys from all over the
fucking planet, man. Amazing.

00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:32.757
MATT: Got to meet a bunch of people from the CR
Translate team, bunch of fantastic artists and

00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:35.551
writers and general amazing community members.
Thank you for coming out.

00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:37.088
MARISHA: And of course, Arsequeef.

00:11:37.088 --> 00:11:42.430
MATT: Of course, Arsequeef. Legitimately fantastic
gentleman. This definitely will not be our last

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.918
time to Europe. Don't worry, because that was
amazing.

00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:50.165
TRAVIS: Laura and I will get our travel situation
fixed. We didn't know raw plutonium was not

00:11:50.165 --> 00:11:58.040
allowed in the UK. We travel with it always. It is
a fantastic gem. Put it under the moonlight and it radiates.

00:11:58.064 --> 00:12:03.222
MATT: What's great is the longer you keep it next
to Ronin, he doesn't actually have to feed.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.442
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.

00:12:04.442 --> 00:12:09.276
(laughter)

00:12:09.276 --> 00:12:11.325
LIAM: (deep voice) Hey, how you doing?

00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:17.980
MATT: I believe that's the extent of our
announcements, and as such that brings us in to

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.787
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:12:22.787 --> 00:12:27.314
[TV static, click]

00:12:27.314 --> 00:13:41.286
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:13:44.439 --> 00:13:47.468
(laughter)

00:13:47.468 --> 00:13:56.914
MATT: Points to Travis on that one. It's the
ellipses at the end. Like a little squeak. Last we

00:13:56.914 --> 00:14:02.308
left off, The Mighty Nein, in pursuing a thread of
a mysterious orb that seemed to connect in some

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:10.143
way to the entity in which Fjord has somehow
connect himself to, and as such been granted these

00:14:10.143 --> 00:14:15.412
strange eldritch powers, led you southward from
the Menagerie Coast after commandeering a ship

00:14:15.412 --> 00:14:21.278
called The Mist, turned into The Mistake. Followed
it through some dangerous reefs to a pirate ship

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:27.686
called the Squalleater, and there on the captain,
Avantika. You made a pact with her, where the

00:14:27.686 --> 00:14:33.603
choice was to either die or to help aid her and a
companion she hired for this to help navigate this

00:14:33.603 --> 00:14:41.244
island. This strange, seemingly dangerous or
cursed island, to which you made your way through

00:14:41.244 --> 00:14:48.370
the jungle of this Urukaxl. Managed to avoid
lizardmen. Managed to barely sneak through a

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:54.127
ancient city of yuan-ti. Making your way to the
top of this temple and through the interior. A

00:14:54.127 --> 00:15:00.759
series of battles later, an encounter with a
strange lightless internal orchard in which two of

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:04.355
the fruit within had been eaten by two members of
your team and have been tripping balls ever since.

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:06.470
SAM: That's right. Oh god.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:13.112
MATT: You made your way to the bottom,
subterranean, guardian chamber, where you met a

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:22.529
yuan-ti abomination that was laying guard to the
true guardian: a large hydra. The hydra had turned

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:26.585
around and laid waste to much of your party, but
you managed to, through a series of clever

00:15:26.585 --> 00:15:32.240
choices, uses of fire magic, and some rapid
assaults, managed to cleave all the heads from its

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.868
body and kill it just in time. Its corpse now
lying fresh on the ground, Captain Avantika

00:15:38.868 --> 00:15:45.774
seeming pleased and impressed by the display of
the strange, new compatriots that have now come to

00:15:45.774 --> 00:15:51.873
work under her. You now sit in the stillness of
this chamber, able to now finally take a moment to

00:15:51.873 --> 00:16:00.671
look about and see what secrets or mysteries it
holds. So Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

00:16:03.113 --> 00:16:08.114
SAM: Was any of that real?

00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:11.173
TRAVIS: Oh no. You're still...

00:16:11.173 --> 00:16:23.811
LIAM: We just need to wait this out. We killed all
the creatures. How many eyes do I have right now?

00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:25.747
Because it feels like I have three of them.

00:16:25.747 --> 00:16:27.602
SAM: You do. You have three eyes.

00:16:27.602 --> 00:16:30.079
LIAM: That's good.

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:33.905
MARISHA: What's Avantika doing?

00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:39.829
MATT: Avantika is sitting down for a second and
getting her breath. The rest of you who are still

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:50.298
up in the hallway, which is Jester, Caduceus, and
Jamedi and Caleb, all begin to slowly descend the stairs.

00:16:50.298 --> 00:16:52.804
LIAM: Whoa.

00:16:52.804 --> 00:17:06.053
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's been a fucking thing in here.
What's so funny? Hey, zip it. The hydra, did it

00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:09.348
(sliding) back in the hole, or is it still out?

00:17:09.348 --> 00:17:12.687
MATT: No, it's currently slung over the side of
the staircase that curves down into the

00:17:12.687 --> 00:17:15.126
subterranean chamber.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.080
MARISHA: How do they make you sound differently?
It feels like you sound different because of the

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.797
gloves. I think it's just in my head.

00:17:25.797 --> 00:17:31.175
TRAVIS: It's just in your head. I got stung by
some wasps out by the barn.

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:34.126
(laughter)

00:17:34.126 --> 00:17:39.801
TRAVIS: Ah! Y'all have Benadryl?

00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:43.079
MATT: Two healing potions and an EpiPen. Hold on.

00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:46.806
TRAVIS: That was a thing. Caduceus?

00:17:46.806 --> 00:17:48.103
TALIESIN: Yeah?

00:17:48.103 --> 00:17:49.923
TRAVIS: Is Jamedi up there?

00:17:49.923 --> 00:17:52.338
TALIESIN: In theory.

00:17:52.753 --> 00:17:56.979
MATT: Jamedi's currently standing at the top,
glancing around the side.

00:17:56.979 --> 00:17:59.887
TALIESIN: I assure you, it's safe now.

00:17:59.887 --> 00:18:05.533
LIAM: Oh yeah. Hey, you guy! How come you did not
do anything?

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:13.866
MATT: He glances around and steps down another
step. "I was not paid to do anything of this sort.

00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:22.059
"I was a guide. I was to delve. I am not skilled in
the ways you are. I'm not stupid to throw myself

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.933
"in front of a beast so large."

00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:29.424
SAM: Worried you could maybe die?

00:18:29.424 --> 00:18:36.408
LIAM: It was pretty touch-and-go. Do you want to
sit back and stay safe and then get eaten? I am

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.542
really not myself right now.

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:43.080
MARISHA: Yeah. You're being super aggro. It's
intense.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.144
TALIESIN: Is Jamedi wearing any weapons?

00:18:45.144 --> 00:18:47.632
MATT: Actually, make a perception check.

00:18:48.997 --> 00:18:51.212
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to use this new d20
and see how that goes.

00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:52.615
SAM: Oh, where'd you get this?

00:18:52.615 --> 00:18:57.693
TALIESIN: The con. Ah! That's good. That's a good
start. 27.

00:18:57.693 --> 00:19:05.870
MATT: Looking at his person, he has a short bow
and a dagger, and that is it. He's not armed for

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:12.237
any sort of main assault. In fact, most of his
equipment and materials, in the way he's armored

00:19:12.237 --> 00:19:20.007
and dressed, is for expediency, lack of sound, and
meant to blend into his surroundings fairly easy.

00:19:20.007 --> 00:19:25.907
A lot of browns, grays, and dull greens. He's
definitely more of a scout and a tracker, based on

00:19:25.907 --> 00:19:30.120
his skill set from what you've seen, than any sort
of frontline fighter.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.645
MARISHA: I want to go over to Avantika.

00:19:36.645 --> 00:19:46.175
MATT: As you approach, she gets up and rummages
off the side and pulls off a small lantern she

00:19:46.175 --> 00:19:49.769
keeps notched on the side of her belt.

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:53.557
MARISHA: Do I see anything else tucked up under
there while she is doing that that looks of

00:19:53.557 --> 00:19:56.024
interest or of importance?

00:19:56.024 --> 00:19:59.046
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:20:00.427 --> 00:20:03.434
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 19.

00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:11.065
MATT: Nothing in particular beyond what she
previously had, that you can tell at the moment,

00:20:11.065 --> 00:20:16.551
no. It's a small lantern, maybe that big, and she
pulls a piece of cloth out that was meant to keep

00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:20.277
it from clattering or making any noise on the
inside. She pulls out the cloth, tucks it in her

00:20:20.277 --> 00:20:27.043
pocket, ignites the end of an oil wick. The
lantern glows a bit and gives off some light. She

00:20:27.043 --> 00:20:30.094
begins walking along the walls of the inside of
the chamber.

00:20:30.094 --> 00:20:35.715
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Detect Magic.

00:20:35.715 --> 00:20:37.697
MARISHA: On the lantern?

00:20:37.697 --> 00:20:42.970
TALIESIN: On everything. Including our friends and
everything in the room.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:48.486
TRAVIS: I'll mirror Avantika's movement on the
other side of the room.

00:20:48.486 --> 00:20:54.823
MATT: As you cast Detect Magic, a few things. All
of your friends give off a faint aura. Everything

00:20:54.823 --> 00:21:04.746
but Jamedi gives off a magical aura. You also
sense the columns themselves have a fairly

00:21:04.746 --> 00:21:13.320
powerful, deep magical aura to them. That's the
most you can see at the moment.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.597
TALIESIN: Nothing Jamedi is wearing at all is
giving off a--?

00:21:16.597 --> 00:21:26.414
MATT: Nothing. Fjord, as you begin to walk along
what would be considered the southern walls around

00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:33.738
this side of the chamber, you and Avantika,
looking across, the walls appear to be made of the

00:21:33.738 --> 00:21:42.059
same eldest stone that this temple is made from.
The newer materials that have been plastered and

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:50.104
set against what once was this original temple did
not make its way this far into the basement. It

00:21:50.104 --> 00:21:56.638
seems that there is no intent to cover, or at
least, hasn't gotten to the point of covering what

00:21:56.638 --> 00:22:01.426
originally lined the walls of this chamber, and as
such, the original carvings remain. What you see

00:22:01.426 --> 00:22:08.743
are three massive carved murals on that wall, that
wall, and this far side, mirroring the placement

00:22:08.743 --> 00:22:17.681
of the three pillars. These murals stand probably
15 feet tall and about 20 or so feet wide. You can

00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:25.346
see them depicting these giant, faintly detailed
and gently colored scenes, though a lot of the

00:22:25.346 --> 00:22:32.208
coloration seems to have faded with dust and time.
Some of the stone has been stained or painted to

00:22:32.208 --> 00:22:37.602
show some variation in color. You can make out the
simple shapes to fill out this much larger

00:22:37.602 --> 00:22:44.589
tapestry on the stone before you. The one on that
far wall, as you come across it, you see a crowd

00:22:44.589 --> 00:22:52.208
of people. Simple design, but definitive heads and
shoulders and legs. You can see the humanoid form,

00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:58.017
and there are many, many clustered around the base
of this mural. Above them, you can see three

00:22:58.017 --> 00:23:08.929
larger humanoid figures that are haloed by a light
or an aura that elevates them beyond this crowd.

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:17.643
Three figures. Then over the top of that, taking
up probably 60 percent or more of this mural, you

00:23:17.643 --> 00:23:26.439
see a humongous bird of dark purple flame that is
wreathing the sky above this crowd. You see its

00:23:26.439 --> 00:23:33.493
wings curved upward and then bent down, and where
the wings end, fire curls and burns, and the

00:23:33.493 --> 00:23:40.489
feathers on the edges of these wings definitively
come up into a purple and dark gray flame with

00:23:40.489 --> 00:23:47.370
bits and specks of deep red. At the top where its
head looks down, the beak long and pointed, there

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:57.925
are three eyes across its face, and in each of
these eyes you see set a rather large onyx stone.

00:23:57.925 --> 00:23:59.421
SAM: It's a bird?

00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:01.083
MATT: A large, flaming bird.

00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:02.502
MARISHA: Like a phoenix?

00:24:02.502 --> 00:24:06.947
MATT: Like a phoenix, but dark purples and grays
and deep reds in color.

00:24:06.947 --> 00:24:11.772
LIAM: Three eyes, each one is an onyx stone?

00:24:11.772 --> 00:24:17.816
MATT: Each one of those eyes is an onyx stone.
Probably about that big.

00:24:17.816 --> 00:24:24.341
TALIESIN: Mr. Fjord, I feel like I should mention
I'm keeping a lookout for anything and I'm getting

00:24:24.341 --> 00:24:30.417
a bit of a magical aura from the three columns. I
don't know if it's related to this.

00:24:30.417 --> 00:24:36.423
LIAM: Are you reading anything off of all of the
eyes that I am seeing, those stones?

00:24:36.423 --> 00:24:41.612
MATT: You don't see any magical essence on the
carving or the stones, just from those pillars.

00:24:41.612 --> 00:24:50.408
Glancing at the pillars, too, there's faint carved
designs and shapes, like swirling, almost

00:24:50.408 --> 00:24:57.411
serpentine circles and curves that chain into each
other and swirl off. Imagine a column made of

00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:05.585
chains, if you will, but the patterns are erratic
in places and don't seem to follow.

00:25:05.585 --> 00:25:10.752
TALIESIN: The three columns are very similar,
there's nothing unique, the pattern within them

00:25:10.752 --> 00:25:12.756
doesn't deviate too much?

00:25:12.756 --> 00:25:13.767
MATT: From what you can tell, no.

00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:15.423
TALIESIN: All right.

00:25:15.423 --> 00:25:22.271
MATT: That's the far wall. If you continue curving
around to the one closest to me, you meet up with

00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:30.370
Avantika at that point. She holds her lantern up,
and you can see a very similar layout, a very

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:37.938
familiar showing of a crowd. Much like the
previous one, though some of their shapes have

00:25:37.938 --> 00:25:45.264
different shoulders. It looks almost like their
clothing or whatever their accoutrements are are

00:25:45.264 --> 00:25:54.725
different. It seems to insinuate a different
people. Above them, three more figures stand,

00:25:54.725 --> 00:26:08.635
shown larger and emanating some sort of radiance
or aura. Above that, you see this giant, coiled

00:26:08.635 --> 00:26:15.664
serpent of scale, fin, and eyes made of amber.
Each of these eyes is a separate amber piece about

00:26:15.664 --> 00:26:23.211
that big around, the size of a large gold piece,
all along the coil of its body. At the very top,

00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:32.668
where it's rearing up, this very long, thin,
pointed, almost lizard-like maw opens up, and

00:26:32.668 --> 00:26:37.982
behind it, this giant tidal wave is curling and
frozen in place, looking like it's about to bear

00:26:37.982 --> 00:26:41.923
down on and either destroy or sweep away the crowd
below it.

00:26:41.923 --> 00:26:47.735
LIAM: Question: do the eyes in this picture bear
any resemblance to the tattoos I spied through the

00:26:47.735 --> 00:26:52.697
window when I eavesdropped through Frumpkin on
Fjord and Avantika's conversation?

00:26:52.697 --> 00:26:53.587
MATT: Very much so.

00:26:53.587 --> 00:26:54.829
LIAM: Very much so, okay.

00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:56.932
SAM: Two eyes on this one?

00:26:56.932 --> 00:27:04.720
MATT: On this one, the head of it has three eyes
as well, but the body itself has eyes evenly

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.693
spaced around the entire length of its coiled
body.

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:11.297
LIAM: <i>Und</i> amber for the three eyes on the head,
or every single time?

00:27:11.297 --> 00:27:17.436
MATT: Every single eye on it is a piece of amber,
matching size.

00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:23.790
TRAVIS: The eyes, they're there, right? It's part
of the mural, they're not missing or recessed or anything?

00:27:24.106 --> 00:27:26.932
MATT: They all appear to be present.

00:27:26.932 --> 00:27:33.594
LIAM: You described the first group looked
humanoid, no strange features, just arms, legs,

00:27:33.594 --> 00:27:38.558
head, but for the second one with the serpent
they're a little weird?

00:27:38.558 --> 00:27:43.958
MATT: More detail has been put into them. More
care has been placed into their carving.

00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:46.769
TRAVIS: Onyx eyes for the first creature...

00:27:46.769 --> 00:27:53.408
MARISHA: Amber eyes for the second. What about the
third? I'll go over and look at the far mural.

00:27:53.408 --> 00:28:00.556
MATT: Avantika continues curving around with a
big, wide-eyed smile on her face. As she passes by

00:28:00.556 --> 00:28:05.950
it, she goes, "This is incredible."

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:13.673
TRAVIS: Yes, it's very stimulating. Have you ever
seen imagery like this before?

00:28:13.673 --> 00:28:17.942
MATT: "I can only assume this is carved by the
Ki'Nau."

00:28:17.942 --> 00:28:20.358
TRAVIS: Yeah, yep, the Ki'Nau.

00:28:20.358 --> 00:28:21.305
MARISHA: The quinoa?

00:28:21.305 --> 00:28:26.509
TRAVIS: Nope, the Ki'Nau. They're the followers of
Uk'otoa, right?

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:28.064
MATT: "That is correct."

00:28:28.064 --> 00:28:29.637
SAM: The Ki'Nau?

00:28:29.637 --> 00:28:32.130
TRAVIS: Ki'Nau.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:38.019
MATT: She continues curving around. Beau and
Caduceus, as you walk to the other wall, that side

00:28:38.019 --> 00:28:47.489
of the chamber, there you see a curling, thick
worm of some kind. Its folded skin and tooth-like

00:28:47.489 --> 00:28:53.969
scales burrowing up to produce mountains over the
crowd, cliff faces made of stone and rock breaking

00:28:53.969 --> 00:29:00.113
and about to plummet into the crowd below. There
beneath it you see three figures once more

00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:07.920
elevated, the same wreath around them of some sort
of radiance or light. The people below don't seem

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:16.357
scared. There's no sign of fleeing or fear, just a
gathering. Within this large, terrifying,

00:29:16.357 --> 00:29:23.375
worm-like creature, its form bulbous with these
strange protrusions, these spine-like scales that

00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:31.060
you can imagine would pull it through the broken
earth, you see this ring of teeth that accentuates

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:41.892
where its mouth is, and on the inside, where a
tongue would be, there instead are three eyes

00:29:41.892 --> 00:29:53.421
across the inside of its mouth. These appear to be
made of some kind of ivory, some polished, white material.

00:29:53.421 --> 00:29:57.351
SAM: Wow. That is vivid.

00:29:57.351 --> 00:30:04.080
LIAM: Also the three figures on each wall, are
they standard humanoid form?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.270
MATT: The three figures all appear to be humanoid.
They're not detailed enough to the point where you

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:12.243
can see features to differentiate between elven,
human, halfling.

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:16.505
SAM: Do they seem to be the same three on each, or
is it just silhouettes?

00:30:16.505 --> 00:30:18.168
MATT: It's just silhouettes of three figures.

00:30:18.168 --> 00:30:22.970
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:31.524
MATT: You hear Avantika's voice echo from across
the way. She goes, "These are the Chosen." She

00:30:31.524 --> 00:30:39.392
brings light over towards the one of Uk'otoa on
the wall and goes, "I guess that makes this one

00:30:39.392 --> 00:30:44.068
"me?" She takes her finger and takes a little blood
from the corner of her mouth from the fight and

00:30:44.068 --> 00:30:50.032
draws a little smiley face on one of the three.
"And this one is you," and goes and draws another

00:30:50.032 --> 00:30:51.862
face on the middle one.

00:30:51.862 --> 00:31:01.100
TRAVIS: I can see the resemblance. The question
is, if that's you, and that's me, who's our third friend?

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.963
MATT: "That is a very good question."

00:31:02.963 --> 00:31:06.270
TRAVIS: You said you had met only one other Chosen
before.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.671
MATT: "Only one, yes."

00:31:07.671 --> 00:31:10.237
TRAVIS: And what happened to them?

00:31:10.237 --> 00:31:21.744
MATT: "They were a very informative partner. They
are the one that introduced me to the great

00:31:21.744 --> 00:31:30.024
"possibility of power under Uk'otoa. We traveled
this ocean for quite a number of years together,

00:31:30.024 --> 00:31:37.809
"but they proved to be a coward. They took
something important to our mission and vanished,

00:31:37.809 --> 00:31:45.750
"and I have spent many years trying to recover what
they stole. With no luck. I figured it was more

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:53.139
"worth my time to pillage enough coin to pay other
people to find them for me. And so far, based on

00:31:53.139 --> 00:31:58.186
"the fact that it brought you to me, a much more
successful endeavor, eh?"

00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:03.367
TRAVIS: Indeed. This person that seemed to have
shown you the light, did you try to track them

00:32:03.367 --> 00:32:09.329
down? Do you know anything about them or where
they might be? They would seem to be very useful

00:32:09.329 --> 00:32:11.348
in our current situation.

00:32:11.348 --> 00:32:18.337
MATT: "This is very true. Well, it seems I may
have some information. Let's get back to the ship,

00:32:18.337 --> 00:32:25.109
"eh? Let's finish our business here and let's talk
over a glass of wine."

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:32.827
TRAVIS: Well, we're obviously not in a huge rush.
We have not explored all of this.

00:32:32.827 --> 00:32:37.853
MATT: "This is true." She begins to make her way
towards the well at the center of the chamber.

00:32:37.853 --> 00:32:40.937
TALIESIN: I was heading that way myself.

00:32:40.937 --> 00:32:45.512
LIAM: Is there any writing of any kind?

00:32:45.512 --> 00:32:51.787
MATT: Glancing about at the pillars, you two can
see within the shapes glowing runes that trace

00:32:51.787 --> 00:32:58.620
from ceiling to floor, then across the ground and
all meet at the well.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:03.788
LIAM: Am I able to read it with the Comprehend
Languages that should still be cooking, because

00:33:03.788 --> 00:33:05.117
it's an hour-long spell?

00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:11.621
MATT: It's not technically a language. These are
runes. These are glyphs of some kind. Make an

00:33:11.621 --> 00:33:13.670
arcana check.

00:33:14.752 --> 00:33:21.440
LIAM: Come on, dice. Be good to me. No. That is a
17.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:29.145
MATT: There are different epochs in historical
time in which there have been advances and

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:36.528
developments of arcane runes and sigils. There is
the early basis of magical runes, which is a

00:33:36.528 --> 00:33:42.599
deviation of Draconic as a language, and then
there are ways that they've been altered and made

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:51.314
more efficient. These are very old, base, early
Draconic runes. As such, they hold a lot more very

00:33:51.314 --> 00:33:59.109
primal magical power, and usually are reserved for
larger rituals and magics that are meant to last

00:33:59.109 --> 00:34:07.109
for very long periods of time. The nature of the
magic on these runes, from what you can tell, it's

00:34:07.109 --> 00:34:16.884
a little hard to get the direct essence, but there
is some sort of an abjuration-based magic.

00:34:16.884 --> 00:34:29.438
SAM: I'm going to go investigate-- not the hydra,
the creature that I killed.

00:34:29.438 --> 00:34:36.166
MATT: You head on over to the other yuan-ti, and
as you approach, the body lies there, tongue

00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:46.611
lolling out and drool and blood, a mixture of
thick saliva mingling with the dark black-purple

00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:51.744
blood out of the corner of its mouth, its eyes
wide open and rolled back. Its dark, thick green

00:34:51.744 --> 00:34:57.893
scales of its snake-like head and thick, muscular
scaled torso all lie limp across the stone where

00:34:57.893 --> 00:35:04.876
it was slain. Its blade has clattered to the
ground a few feet from its grasp and its polished

00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:10.523
marble and silver shield scattered a few feet from
its form. The rest of its tail coils and is limp

00:35:10.523 --> 00:35:13.472
off to the side from there.

00:35:13.472 --> 00:35:17.705
SAM: I'll rifle around looking for any keys or
objects.

00:35:17.705 --> 00:35:19.608
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:35:19.608 --> 00:35:21.711
SAM: 25.

00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:30.419
MATT: Nice. You find on its body 26 pieces of
gold. Only gold, no other pieces of coin on its

00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:39.380
body. The blade is a very, very large blade. It
looks like it's well made, both for ceremonial

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:45.747
purposes and for actual combat. It is both
beautiful and very well made, and the shield

00:35:45.747 --> 00:35:51.048
itself is also exquisitely crafted and shows no
signs of wear.

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:56.802
SAM: I'll take the shield and hang on to it until
I can give it someone who wants it.

00:35:56.802 --> 00:36:04.709
MATT: Okay. At this point, Avantika's walked to
the edge of the well and looks down into the space below.

00:36:04.709 --> 00:36:07.162
MARISHA: I walk up behind her and I go, huh!

00:36:07.162 --> 00:36:07.934
MATT: Do you really?

00:36:07.934 --> 00:36:08.799
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:09.962
SAM: Like, pushing her?

00:36:09.962 --> 00:36:13.332
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't actually push her in but I
just want to freak her out.

00:36:13.332 --> 00:36:14.832
TRAVIS: She's going to do that.

00:36:14.832 --> 00:36:19.968
MATT: She whips around as you do that and both her
hand grabs your wrist to deflect it and you wrench

00:36:19.968 --> 00:36:23.588
your wrist free as a natural instinct and you both
have this moment of--

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.151
MATT and MARISHA: Eh!

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:33.973
TRAVIS: You know, I do have a solution I think for
this. Jamedi! You worthless sack of shit, you

00:36:33.973 --> 00:36:40.254
haven't done a damn thing since we got in this
temple. You like to scout ahead, go forward? Get

00:36:40.254 --> 00:36:42.071
your ass down that well.

00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:46.705
MATT: He's still at the top of the stairs. He
goes, "Well, for one thing, I was paid to go to

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:55.451
"the temple, and no further. The fact that I have
even come this far is because I need to claim my pay."

00:36:55.451 --> 00:36:59.357
TRAVIS: What do you want, a cookie? Get down the
fucking well, let's go.

00:36:59.357 --> 00:37:06.335
MATT: Avantika goes, "Actually, I think ladies
first."

00:37:06.335 --> 00:37:13.066
TRAVIS: Well, I would insist to join you, if that
is the case.

00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:16.344
MATT: "May the best one win." She dives in.

00:37:16.344 --> 00:37:17.402
TRAVIS: Shit balls.

00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:21.460
LIAM: Wait, Fjord! Can I talk to you for a second
before you go down there?

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.467
TRAVIS: Real quick.

00:37:22.467 --> 00:37:29.415
LIAM: There is-- the pillars are covered when I do
the shield-- when I cover myself and put the

00:37:29.415 --> 00:37:32.206
shield-- the columns have that in them.

00:37:32.206 --> 00:37:33.295
TRAVIS: The pillars are magic?

00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:40.288
LIAM: Yeah, but it's protection. It's holding
something in or holding something back. We know

00:37:40.288 --> 00:37:43.256
what that thing is with the yellow eyes but what
is the tapeworm?

00:37:43.256 --> 00:37:46.090
TRAVIS: I don't know. I don't want her to get too
far ahead.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.287
SAM: I have a few things that I'd like to talk
about.

00:37:48.287 --> 00:37:49.767
TRAVIS: Okay, go.

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:57.435
MATT: Okay, you jump in. First off, Caleb's
distraction has given her quite a lead. She's a

00:37:57.435 --> 00:38:05.344
fairly accomplished swimmer and is making her way
down. This well continues on for a good 70, 80 or

00:38:05.344 --> 00:38:10.767
so feet below. The water is cold. It is salt
water.

00:38:10.767 --> 00:38:12.414
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:38:12.414 --> 00:38:13.835
MARISHA: Salt water?

00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:18.185
TRAVIS: Salt water, not brackish but salt water?

00:38:18.185 --> 00:38:21.905
MATT: Right. You are swimming after her?

00:38:21.905 --> 00:38:22.725
TRAVIS: Mhm.

00:38:22.725 --> 00:38:27.585
MATT: Make an athletics check. You have advantage
because the water is-- because of your armor, it's

00:38:27.585 --> 00:38:31.226
not giving you as much resistance heading south.

00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:36.010
TRAVIS: Athletics? 19.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:42.602
MATT: You begin to close the gap slowly, but she's
eagerly swimming down with almost a fervor. As you

00:38:42.602 --> 00:38:52.638
get deeper into this column, this basin below, the
walls begin to grow thick with algae and grime

00:38:52.638 --> 00:39:03.184
like a thick-- It could be a plant matter that's
just accrued over the walls, or it could be waste

00:39:03.184 --> 00:39:08.466
matter from the hydra in its home that has slowly
congealed to cover the walls. The stone begins to

00:39:08.466 --> 00:39:15.820
give way to this dark, slick material. Once you
hit about the 70, 80 foot point, the tunnel begins

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:22.917
to open like a giant bulb or internal, spherical
chamber. Role another athletics check.

00:39:25.673 --> 00:39:28.115
TRAVIS: 14.

00:39:28.115 --> 00:39:35.744
MATT: She's still keeping her distance from you.
Heading deeper in, the saltiness of the water, the

00:39:35.744 --> 00:39:42.874
brininess, the flavor in your mouth gets more
intense. What was once a semblance of sea water is

00:39:42.874 --> 00:39:50.610
definitively sea water, but also very strongly
briny sea water. Make another athletics check.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.329
TRAVIS: The bulb-- we've entered that chamber,
right?

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.605
MATT: Correct.

00:39:54.605 --> 00:39:57.678
TRAVIS: What's our visibility like? 40, 60?

00:39:57.678 --> 00:40:04.807
MATT: For you, because you have dark vision, you
can see within 30 feet of you, essentially. As far

00:40:04.807 --> 00:40:06.273
as you look the chamber is--

00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:08.769
TRAVIS: There's not a lot of natural light,
right?

00:40:08.769 --> 00:40:17.635
MATT: No. Not at all. It's pitch black down here.
That being the case, you don't see the bottom of

00:40:17.635 --> 00:40:19.880
the chamber, you just see it open--

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.835
TRAVIS: And just her.

00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:22.661
MATT: And just her, but she's gaining.

00:40:22.661 --> 00:40:25.032
TRAVIS: James Cameron going down to find the
Titanic.

00:40:25.032 --> 00:40:29.175
MATT: Just delving straight down into the
darkness. Make another athletics check.

00:40:31.582 --> 00:40:32.707
TRAVIS: 20.

00:40:32.707 --> 00:40:36.596
MATT: 20, okay. She did not role that well that
time. She's beginning to tire, it seems, or at

00:40:36.596 --> 00:40:43.376
least you're starting to pick up speed. As you
continue to follow, you get probably 40 or so feet

00:40:43.376 --> 00:40:48.846
from her, but she's still ahead of you. Role
again.

00:40:53.656 --> 00:40:55.521
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:40:55.906 --> 00:41:05.397
MATT: Natural 20, nice! She rolled okay. You see,
now, the bottom begin to approach. In the

00:41:05.397 --> 00:41:12.776
peripheral of your dark vision, the floor greets
to meet you and you pick up enough speed to where

00:41:12.776 --> 00:41:19.532
you both impact the bottom of this chamber at the
same time. You both hit. She looks up at you, and

00:41:19.532 --> 00:41:25.984
your eyes meet. A few bubbles escape from her
mouth and you see her big, wide, toothy grin and

00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:29.071
she begins scraping grime off the floor.

00:41:29.071 --> 00:41:30.104
TRAVIS: I do the same.

00:41:30.104 --> 00:41:32.210
MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.

00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:36.441
TRAVIS: I don't know what I'm looking for. 23.

00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:38.116
MATT: 23!

00:41:38.116 --> 00:41:40.550
TRAVIS: Plus five.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:48.606
MATT: As the two of you are currently scraping
bits of grime and algae off the ground, there are

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:54.857
bits of plants that are growing up like lightless
kelp that seems to have made some sort of a living

00:41:54.857 --> 00:41:59.361
down here in this subterranean, water-filled
chamber. As you're pushing through and scraping

00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:06.479
around, your hand scoops this large bit of grime
from in front of you and you can see a stone

00:42:06.479 --> 00:42:15.151
relief at the very base of the bottom, a concave,
spherical shape about the size of a fist.

00:42:15.151 --> 00:42:21.661
TRAVIS: Uh huh.

00:42:21.661 --> 00:42:32.693
MATT: She notices it, looks at it, looks at you.
What are you doing?

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:41.052
TRAVIS: Could I try and stick my hand in my
chest?

00:42:41.052 --> 00:42:42.031
MATT: You can.

00:42:42.031 --> 00:42:44.906
TRAVIS: Does it go anywhere?

00:42:44.906 --> 00:42:51.434
MATT: You go and jam your hand and its hitting
your armor. You have a full-on leather plate right there.

00:42:59.257 --> 00:43:05.229
TRAVIS: I don't know what to do. Like the size of
a fist? It's a sphere, right?

00:43:05.229 --> 00:43:11.363
MATT: It's about that big, and you can see it is
concave. It's about the size of the stone that

00:43:11.363 --> 00:43:12.921
you'd found.

00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:15.768
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's in my <i>body</i>.

00:43:15.768 --> 00:43:17.052
SAM: Poop it out.

00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:22.246
TRAVIS: I don't know how! I don't have an eject
button! Can I summon the falchion?

00:43:22.246 --> 00:43:27.184
MATT: You can. The falchion appears in your hand,
and as you do this bright, yellow light is now

00:43:27.184 --> 00:43:31.687
emanating from the center of its hilt where the
eye itself is glowing with its own lantern-like

00:43:31.687 --> 00:43:36.539
source. At which point Avantika is now rushing
towards that thing.

00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:38.570
TRAVIS: Something's about to happen and I just jam
the eye into the--

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:43.391
MATT: Make an initiative roll. Because you gave
her enough time to get up right next to you and

00:43:43.391 --> 00:43:48.430
now we're going to see who gets to it first.

00:43:50.764 --> 00:43:52.984
TRAVIS: Six.

00:43:56.764 --> 00:44:03.140
MATT: Her hand-- she has now pulled the glove from
her right hand. As you go to thrust the hilt of

00:44:03.304 --> 00:44:11.441
the falchion down towards it, you see her hand
reach out and just manage to cover the little

00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:20.616
space first. As it does, you can see her body
tense for a second, and where her hand is this

00:44:20.616 --> 00:44:27.434
bright, familiar yellow glow seems to now spread
from between her fingers sending beams off in

00:44:27.434 --> 00:44:35.040
multiple directions. Her face looks aghast in
shock for a second, and a large bubble escapes

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:41.433
from her mouth. She looks over to you with this
dazed look and pulls her hand back. There, in the

00:44:41.433 --> 00:44:47.205
palm, there's this large open wound where blood's
beginning to cloud the dark water below. There, in

00:44:47.205 --> 00:44:59.284
the center of this hole, you can see one of the
cloven stones there. At which point, a bunch of

00:44:59.284 --> 00:45:07.249
these runes begin to glow in three different
directions from around the base, up the sides, up

00:45:07.249 --> 00:45:09.830
the chamber.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:15.717
The rest of you, looking around, suddenly see this
dull blue glow begin to get brighter from within

00:45:15.717 --> 00:45:19.940
this well. You watch as these runes, that you guys
didn't notice except for the two of you before,

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:25.208
begin to suddenly glow up the sides. The three
pillars suddenly begin to spiral and glow as all

00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:29.948
these runes come to life. Avantika pulls back and
looks back at her hand, she looks back at you, her

00:45:29.948 --> 00:45:39.906
eyes blink for a second, and she just smiles and
you hear this earth-shuddering, soulful crack

00:45:39.906 --> 00:45:46.958
sound rocks the entirety of the temple. Bubbles
suddenly, this one burst of air that had been

00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:53.106
trapped in the ground below, is all immediately
released as one and rises the water above. You can

00:45:53.106 --> 00:45:58.744
look around and see the interior of this; there is
a heavy black crack in the stone of this chamber

00:45:58.744 --> 00:46:05.597
as you guys all hear this earth-shattering bam!
Dust falls off the ceiling of this chamber from

00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:11.986
the inside. The pillars themselves still stand,
but there are multiple places in this chamber now

00:46:11.986 --> 00:46:18.111
where these large black cracks now seem to have
snaked their way in one instant burst across parts

00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:19.455
of the wall.

00:46:19.455 --> 00:46:22.033
LIAM: They are picking the lock on this safe.

00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:26.152
MATT: The glowing runes blink out.

00:46:26.152 --> 00:46:30.116
TALIESIN: I think the lock's picked.

00:46:30.116 --> 00:46:39.428
LIAM: Maybe. They might need three. There's two of
three. I'm eyeing Jamedi as I say that. Presumably

00:46:39.428 --> 00:46:50.083
just two of three. As long as it's just one, maybe
Fjord is thinking better of it.

00:46:50.083 --> 00:46:54.997
TRAVIS: I immediately start searching on the
ground for another opening.

00:46:54.997 --> 00:46:57.271
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:46:57.271 --> 00:47:04.138
MARISHA: Maybe it's not all here. Maybe it's in
another location. Maybe there are two other temples.

00:47:04.138 --> 00:47:05.564
TRAVIS: 12.

00:47:05.564 --> 00:47:11.567
MATT: You start pulling through the weeds and the
kelp and the grime and-- nothing. It's all smooth

00:47:11.567 --> 00:47:18.395
stone except for this one little alcove that you
found first. Avantika is now swimming frantically

00:47:18.395 --> 00:47:21.096
up towards the surface.

00:47:21.096 --> 00:47:22.516
TRAVIS: Frantically?

00:47:22.516 --> 00:47:25.618
MATT: Just trying to kick. She lost quite a bit of
air.

00:47:25.618 --> 00:47:28.188
TRAVIS: I'll go grab her.

00:47:28.188 --> 00:47:32.849
MATT: You go grab her? Okay. Make a grapple
check-- make an athletics check.

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.846
SAM: Stone cold.

00:47:36.698 --> 00:47:37.751
TRAVIS: Seven.

00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:42.657
MATT: No, she kicks right out of your grasp. She
looks back with an expression of surprise.

00:47:42.657 --> 00:47:46.058
TRAVIS: I'm pointing at the ground.

00:47:46.058 --> 00:47:48.693
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:47:48.693 --> 00:47:50.953
TRAVIS: I'm okay at those.

00:47:50.953 --> 00:47:53.013
SAM: Travis, you have your fate, too.

00:47:53.013 --> 00:47:55.111
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:47:55.111 --> 00:48:01.397
MATT: She looks confused and continues swimming
upward, not reading too much into it. She

00:48:01.397 --> 00:48:05.782
continues to clamber up to the surface. The rest
of you, as you're looking about, the surface of

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:10.935
the water begins to spill over the sides of the
well.

00:48:10.935 --> 00:48:15.371
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading towards the
stairs. I'm going to recommend everybody else,

00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:17.483
let's go.

00:48:17.483 --> 00:48:18.961
SAM: That sounds good, yes.

00:48:18.961 --> 00:48:24.508
MATT: He goes, "Yeah, okay, of course." Jester's
like, "This is not very good. Where's Fjord?"

00:48:24.508 --> 00:48:29.088
She's looking over very nervously towards the
pool, which now the chamber's rapidly filling.

00:48:29.088 --> 00:48:30.645
You're already at knee height.

00:48:30.645 --> 00:48:33.421
SAM: He likes water. He'll be fine. Come on! Let's
get out of here.

00:48:33.421 --> 00:48:36.356
MARISHA: I stand with Jester at the edge of the
pool, looking down.

00:48:36.356 --> 00:48:41.416
MATT: Okay, you guys, glancing down. Jamedi's back
in the chamber, his eyes wide, goes, "We should

00:48:41.416 --> 00:48:45.465
"go. Bring her back, she owes me money!"

00:48:45.465 --> 00:48:48.002
LIAM: I'm grabbing Nott by the scruff and dragging
her up the stairs.

00:48:48.002 --> 00:48:51.297
SAM: You don't have to drag me, I'm going!

00:48:51.297 --> 00:48:52.608
LIAM: Okay.

00:48:52.608 --> 00:48:58.571
MATT: As you guys all begin to climb up the
stairs, the chamber is filling very quickly with

00:48:58.571 --> 00:49:03.732
the water. It's now reaching the base of the
stairs, at which point, as you guys-- Beau, you

00:49:03.732 --> 00:49:07.083
and Jester, there's just enough water now where
your buoyancy carries you off your feet and you're

00:49:07.083 --> 00:49:12.193
now actually treading water in the chamber. At
which point Avantika makes it to the surface with

00:49:12.193 --> 00:49:17.149
a large gasp of air, and but a few moments later
Fjord also breaks the surface.

00:49:17.149 --> 00:49:19.026
SAM: Come on, Fjord, let's get out of here!

00:49:19.026 --> 00:49:20.008
TRAVIS: Wait, what's happening?

00:49:20.008 --> 00:49:24.666
SAM: The water! Bad water! All water's bad, but
this is even worse.

00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:26.007
MARISHA: What the hell happened?

00:49:26.007 --> 00:49:29.605
MATT: It's continuing to fill. The stairway that's
leading upward, the water has now reached the base

00:49:29.605 --> 00:49:36.305
of the doorway, and you have a few moments, maybe
six seconds or so before the doorway itself is

00:49:36.305 --> 00:49:37.580
completely filled with water.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.094
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

00:49:39.094 --> 00:49:42.984
MATT: You're all going into a full swim here,
double move, half speed for all of you guys, so

00:49:42.984 --> 00:49:44.629
it's going to take you a little bit.

00:49:44.629 --> 00:49:45.729
SAM: I'm walking up.

00:49:45.729 --> 00:49:50.994
MATT: Except for you. You guys are already up
there. As you all get to the stairway and make

00:49:50.994 --> 00:49:56.034
your way up to the top, the water continues to
pour up, following behind you. You get to the

00:49:56.034 --> 00:50:00.096
stairs, and you're having to trudge through. You
get up to the next, the secondary floor, and there

00:50:00.096 --> 00:50:08.176
you stand, with the walls that are partially
relieved and covered, and there is the stone slab

00:50:08.176 --> 00:50:12.076
that is lifted up, and there's orchard before you.
What do you do?

00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:14.046
SAM: Oh, the orchard, that's right.

00:50:14.046 --> 00:50:15.817
TRAVIS: Were there-- There were stairs up the
sides, right?

00:50:15.817 --> 00:50:17.084
LIAM: Weren't there spiral stairways?

00:50:17.084 --> 00:50:20.610
MATT: Yeah, there is the fountain, but it has
been-- It rose back up to the top when this

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.113
chamber door was opened.

00:50:22.113 --> 00:50:23.561
SAM: Oh, so there's no stairs?

00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:27.516
MATT: Currently, no. It's raised up and closed
off, the front, when you opened the doorway to get

00:50:27.516 --> 00:50:29.538
deeper into the basement.

00:50:29.538 --> 00:50:31.384
LIAM: Can we see to the ceiling of this chamber?

00:50:31.384 --> 00:50:34.600
MATT: Make a perception check. With you,
disadvantage because you are human.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:39.668
LIAM: Eyes up. Make a perception, you said?

00:50:39.668 --> 00:50:40.475
MATT: Yes.

00:50:40.475 --> 00:50:41.450
LIAM: 15.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:47.056
MATT: You can see the pillar that holds the
fountain at the top, and there are the stairs,

00:50:47.056 --> 00:50:51.108
still part of it, and you can see where it's up
there, but whatever mechanism, rocks--

00:50:51.108 --> 00:50:53.039
LIAM: Yeah, it's stuck up there, <i>ja</i>?

00:50:53.039 --> 00:50:54.318
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:50:54.318 --> 00:50:55.527
SAM: Let's climb!

00:50:55.527 --> 00:50:57.316
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Is everybody outside?

00:50:57.316 --> 00:50:58.416
SAM: Oh, shit!

00:50:58.416 --> 00:50:59.773
TALIESIN: Is everybody in the chamber right now?

00:50:59.773 --> 00:51:00.613
TRAVIS: Fucking hourglass, damn it.

00:51:00.613 --> 00:51:03.927
MATT: The central chamber is now-- The water has
now reached the base of orchard and is now filling.

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:06.497
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit the button to re-close
the-- to close the--

00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:08.077
MATT: You don't know the button, you never found
it.

00:51:08.077 --> 00:51:09.163
TALIESIN: Oh, who did?

00:51:09.163 --> 00:51:10.420
MATT: I don't know, who did?

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.647
TRAVIS: It was Nott.

00:51:11.647 --> 00:51:12.188
TALIESIN: Yeah?

00:51:12.188 --> 00:51:12.899
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:51:12.899 --> 00:51:15.135
TALIESIN: Okay, do you mind hitting the button to
close this thing again?

00:51:15.135 --> 00:51:22.791
SAM: Oh, yes! Sure! It was one of these holes. I'm
going to just pick one. I go to the north one.

00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:24.727
MATT: Okay, you go to the--

00:51:24.727 --> 00:51:26.078
TRAVIS: Oh, god, which one was it?

00:51:26.078 --> 00:51:29.831
SAM: I don't know. I don't remember. I'm just
going to go into one of-- Aren't these-- there's

00:51:29.831 --> 00:51:31.624
little holes, right?

00:51:31.624 --> 00:51:35.303
MATT: There are. As you can see now, the water
that has begun to fill up the chamber is taking--

00:51:35.303 --> 00:51:39.152
It's a little slower in here, because it's a much
wider space now, but you can see eggs starting to

00:51:39.152 --> 00:51:45.786
flow, float out from the other chambers. The other
two rooms were the two hatchery areas where you

00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:47.746
saw the larger eggs were set.

00:51:47.746 --> 00:51:49.721
MARISHA: Right. Hang on.

00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:51.091
SAM: Do I remember which one was the--

00:51:51.091 --> 00:51:51.900
MARISHA: I do.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.916
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

00:51:53.916 --> 00:51:59.778
SAM: Nine. Oh, plus six? No, this is not a saving
throw.

00:51:59.778 --> 00:52:00.837
MATT: No, it's just straight bonus.

00:52:00.837 --> 00:52:02.571
SAM: Plus three? So, 12.

00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:05.218
MATT: You recall it was in the chamber where
you're standing, and it's not too far from the

00:52:05.218 --> 00:52:08.281
stairs where you guys descended below.

00:52:08.281 --> 00:52:13.466
SAM: Okay. Do I see a little door, a little hole
near where I'm standing?

00:52:13.466 --> 00:52:17.396
MATT: You look over to the side. Make a quick
investigation check.

00:52:17.396 --> 00:52:19.372
SAM: Natural 20.

00:52:19.372 --> 00:52:21.175
MATT: You reach over, and you find it, and you hit
it.

00:52:21.175 --> 00:52:22.133
TRAVIS: Come on!

00:52:22.133 --> 00:52:24.494
MATT: The door slams shut and locks you in the
room.

00:52:24.494 --> 00:52:25.609
SAM: Locks me--

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.405
MARISHA: What?

00:52:26.405 --> 00:52:27.322
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

00:52:27.322 --> 00:52:30.353
MATT: You hear a grinding on the other side of the
chamber of the fountain lowering.

00:52:30.353 --> 00:52:31.747
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:52:31.747 --> 00:52:32.584
SAM: Fountain lowering?

00:52:32.584 --> 00:52:33.295
TRAVIS: Right.

00:52:33.295 --> 00:52:34.892
LIAM: So the fountain lowered, but Nott is trapped
inside--

00:52:34.892 --> 00:52:37.620
MATT: Nott, and everybody else who hasn't left
that chamber, is inside. The only people that said

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.832
they were leaving that room, I believe, were
Caduceus, who was going up.

00:52:41.832 --> 00:52:43.955
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going because I was-- oh,
god.

00:52:43.955 --> 00:52:45.642
MATT: So all of you are now locked in the chamber
with Nott.

00:52:45.642 --> 00:52:47.276
MARISHA: Oh, wait, can you open it?

00:52:47.276 --> 00:52:49.178
LIAM: Wait, we're in the chamber? We're all inside
there?

00:52:49.178 --> 00:52:50.584
MATT: You're all in the chamber with Nott, yeah.

00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:51.506
TRAVIS: That chamber goes downstairs, right?

00:52:51.506 --> 00:52:53.820
SAM: I will open it up again.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.212
MATT: The fountain raises up, the chamber opens up
again.

00:52:57.212 --> 00:52:58.805
TALIESIN: Mage Hand! Come on!

00:52:58.805 --> 00:53:00.308
TRAVIS: Come on out!

00:53:00.308 --> 00:53:02.423
SAM: Everybody out! I cast Mage Hand!

00:53:02.423 --> 00:53:07.488
MATT: Okay. You move around, you cast Mage Hand.
The door slams shut, the two other doors slam

00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:12.258
shut. The chamber now is about waist high in
water, and you watch as the pillar begins to

00:53:12.258 --> 00:53:18.334
slowly lower. It is a slow drag down.

00:53:18.334 --> 00:53:20.599
MARISHA: Okay, let's go. Come on.

00:53:20.599 --> 00:53:21.765
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to climb up.

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:22.821
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:53:22.821 --> 00:53:26.562
MATT: Okay. The stairway itself, if you recall,
ends a little bit ways up, and there's a bit of a

00:53:26.562 --> 00:53:32.627
drop down to get to it. It slowly comes down and
does meet the floor. There's a bit of a lip to get

00:53:32.627 --> 00:53:37.367
up there now, so if you ascend to the top of the
staircase, there is about a ten foot or so jump

00:53:37.367 --> 00:53:40.420
where it is smooth walls before you can actually
get to the top floor.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.084
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:53:41.084 --> 00:53:41.968
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:53:41.968 --> 00:53:43.654
TALIESIN: We'll get up there and drop a rope.

00:53:43.654 --> 00:53:45.569
MARISHA: Yeah, I can do that.

00:53:45.569 --> 00:53:46.861
TRAVIS: Let's try that.

00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:47.778
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:53:47.778 --> 00:53:50.158
SAM: Like to make the jump? Do you want to jump
off of Yasha or anything?

00:53:50.158 --> 00:53:50.866
MARISHA: Sure.

00:53:50.866 --> 00:53:51.795
TALIESIN: Can Yasha fly?

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:53.778
MARISHA: Give me a boost, the cheerleader hoist?

00:53:53.778 --> 00:53:59.969
MATT: Yasha goes over and gives you a boost. That
gives you advantage on your acrobatics check to

00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:03.253
try and parkour up the stairs and leap off the
sides.

00:54:03.253 --> 00:54:04.675
MARISHA: Jesus Christ!

00:54:04.675 --> 00:54:07.670
LIAM: I'm going to cast Dancing Lights and send
four globules up around the roof so that everyone

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:09.646
can see everything perfectly.

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:12.255
MARISHA: 12 on my acrobatics.

00:54:12.255 --> 00:54:18.619
MATT: You leap, slide off the side and manage to
fall down into the water next to it. You come out

00:54:18.619 --> 00:54:23.237
of the surface. The chamber is now halfway full,
and it's almost starting to reach to the top.

00:54:23.237 --> 00:54:25.765
MARISHA: It's really slippy.

00:54:25.765 --> 00:54:28.047
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and-- Oh, god.

00:54:28.047 --> 00:54:29.039
SAM: Give me a boost!

00:54:29.039 --> 00:54:30.233
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're tall.

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:32.125
TALIESIN: All right. I'm actually weak, somebody
stronger is probably good.

00:54:32.125 --> 00:54:35.491
SAM: I'm going to scurry up Mr. Clay and jump.

00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:37.504
LIAM: Wait, I cast Enlarge on Caduceus so he's
twice his size!

00:54:37.504 --> 00:54:38.790
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.428
MATT: Mighty Caduceus.

00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:42.485
TALIESIN: I'm tall now.

00:54:42.485 --> 00:54:43.108
MATT: Yes.

00:54:43.108 --> 00:54:45.313
TALIESIN: I'm very tall. I might be taller than
the hole.

00:54:45.313 --> 00:54:46.471
TRAVIS: 15 feet tall.

00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:50.376
MATT: You're tall enough to the point where I'd
say, because it's double the size, right?

00:54:50.376 --> 00:54:51.276
LIAM: Double the size, <i>ja</i>.

00:54:51.276 --> 00:54:53.112
MATT: So you're 14 feet. You're not tall enough
for the whole chamber, but you're tall enough to

00:54:53.112 --> 00:54:54.595
push people through.

00:54:54.595 --> 00:54:56.003
TALIESIN: Right, yeah. I'm pushing people through.

00:54:56.003 --> 00:55:00.694
MATT: Alley oop-ing one after the other, you grab
each person and lift them up. Like a little

00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:08.061
booster into the chamber. One by one, you guys all
get up into the top now, and Caduceus, you're too

00:55:08.061 --> 00:55:09.382
big to get up--

00:55:09.382 --> 00:55:12.686
LIAM: Yeah, Caduceus, hold Fjord's hand. Fjord,
hold his hand, you got it?

00:55:12.686 --> 00:55:13.865
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yep.

00:55:13.865 --> 00:55:16.553
LIAM: I cast Reduce, and now he is half his size.

00:55:16.553 --> 00:55:19.027
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:55:19.027 --> 00:55:20.802
TRAVIS: I pull him up top.

00:55:20.802 --> 00:55:25.402
MATT: You pull Caduceus up. You guys are now in
the chamber, standing there, there's the stairs

00:55:25.402 --> 00:55:30.643
that lead up. At which point you hear footfalls,
and you see coming around the corner down-- It

00:55:30.643 --> 00:55:33.456
seems that the sound of the resounding crack in
this temple has drawn the attention of three

00:55:33.456 --> 00:55:37.437
yuan-ti. They turn the corner, you see one of
them, two snake arms a familiar sight as one of

00:55:37.437 --> 00:55:41.827
the malisons comes down and two broodguard are
there. What are you doing? The water is now

00:55:41.827 --> 00:55:45.687
spilling up past out of the hole, and now the top
room is now starting to fill with water.

00:55:45.687 --> 00:55:47.111
TRAVIS: So are we in the top level now?

00:55:47.111 --> 00:55:47.775
MATT: You are.

00:55:47.775 --> 00:55:51.748
TRAVIS: We are. Yep-eb-eb. I'm tapped spell-wise.

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:54.504
SAM: I'm just going to just go (screaming) and
start shooting at the first one.

00:55:54.504 --> 00:55:55.773
MATT: Go for it.

00:55:55.773 --> 00:56:00.233
SAM: That's not great, it's a 14.

00:56:00.233 --> 00:56:04.490
MATT: At this point the water seems to have
accelerated and has now filled the chamber. As you fire--

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:05.848
SAM: 16 to hit.

00:56:05.848 --> 00:56:06.812
MATT: All right.

00:56:06.812 --> 00:56:08.544
TALIESIN: I'm casting Spirit Guardians and rushing
them.

00:56:08.544 --> 00:56:13.897
MATT: Okay. You're now underwater. You take your
last breath, and you've all completely been

00:56:13.897 --> 00:56:19.729
submerged in this chamber. The other yuan-ti you
can see in the darkness below here, the only bit

00:56:19.729 --> 00:56:24.286
of light that you have are the globes still from
you. Although, are those concentration?

00:56:24.286 --> 00:56:26.320
TALIESIN: I've got a light on my stick anyway.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.952
LIAM: Oh, they're gone then because Enlarge,
Reduce.

00:56:27.952 --> 00:56:28.814
MATT: Yes.

00:56:28.814 --> 00:56:30.266
TALIESIN: I would have cast Light on my stick,
then.

00:56:30.266 --> 00:56:33.561
MATT: So you're casting Light on your stick.

00:56:33.561 --> 00:56:37.523
TALIESIN: Anybody I don't like within 15 feet is
currently getting ransacked by tiny fairies.

00:56:37.523 --> 00:56:38.596
MATT: Okay.

00:56:38.596 --> 00:56:41.605
(laughter)

00:56:41.605 --> 00:56:48.057
MATT: I love it. What's the save on that? Wisdom,
I believe.

00:56:48.057 --> 00:56:49.793
TALIESIN: Wisdom 16.

00:56:49.793 --> 00:56:56.006
MATT: Okay, the malison succeeds, the two
broodguard fail. Roll damage on that.

00:56:56.006 --> 00:57:02.172
TALIESIN: That's-- Freaking out a little bit. 3d8
radiant damage?

00:57:02.172 --> 00:57:05.386
MATT: That is correct.

00:57:05.386 --> 00:57:14.143
TALIESIN: That's 11 (counting) 12 points of
radiant damage.

00:57:14.143 --> 00:57:16.078
MATT: 12 point of radiant damage, nice.

00:57:16.078 --> 00:57:17.422
LIAM: None of that was like a melee attack or
anything?

00:57:17.422 --> 00:57:18.331
TALIESIN: No.

00:57:18.331 --> 00:57:19.747
LIAM: Because your damage is reduced since you're
teeny.

00:57:19.747 --> 00:57:21.462
TALIESIN: It doesn't-- They're fairies.

00:57:21.462 --> 00:57:22.910
MATT: All right.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:26.963
TALIESIN: I'm heading straight towards the exit.

00:57:26.963 --> 00:57:29.255
MATT: What was the roll you had to hit?

00:57:29.255 --> 00:57:30.583
SAM: 16 to hit.

00:57:30.583 --> 00:57:35.055
MATT: 16. That will hit the malison. You do not
get sneak attack, however.

00:57:35.055 --> 00:57:40.268
SAM: That's fine. It causes nine hit points of
damage.

00:57:40.268 --> 00:57:42.868
MATT: Nice. That finishes your go there.

00:57:42.868 --> 00:57:46.441
SAM: I would probably bonus action-- if I had a
bonus action I would shoot again.

00:57:46.441 --> 00:57:49.295
MATT: I'd allow it. Because we'll say you're
like-- You were standing on the water so as you're

00:57:49.295 --> 00:57:51.814
leaning over the surface you're like squeezing it
out.

00:57:51.814 --> 00:57:53.086
SAM: 16 to hit again.

00:57:53.086 --> 00:57:54.507
MATT: Nice.

00:57:54.507 --> 00:57:56.827
SAM: Another 11 points of damage.

00:57:56.827 --> 00:58:02.100
MATT: 11 points of damage, good. So, I now need
everyone to roll initiative.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:10.654
SAM: If I'm on top of the water, how much space do
I have?

00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:15.341
MATT: Well, now you don't anymore. The water
surface begins to crush underneath you and then

00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:19.117
you have to delve underneath as it meets it. It's
filled up and it's now making its way up the

00:58:19.117 --> 00:58:26.444
stairs, towards the top of the temple. So, 25 to
20, anyone?

00:58:26.444 --> 00:58:27.817
MARISHA: 20.

00:58:27.817 --> 00:58:28.942
MATT: All right.

00:58:28.942 --> 00:58:31.989
SAM: I'll roll for Jester. Terrible.

00:58:31.989 --> 00:58:33.310
MATT: And roll for Yasha.

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:34.291
TRAVIS: I did.

00:58:34.291 --> 00:58:40.161
MATT: 20 to 15.

00:58:40.642 --> 00:58:42.317
TRAVIS: Nobody.

00:58:42.317 --> 00:58:43.984
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:58:43.984 --> 00:58:47.027
TRAVIS: Yasha got 13. Wow.

00:58:47.493 --> 00:58:48.580
MATT: Guys.

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:50.484
(laugher)

00:58:50.484 --> 00:58:52.985
MATT: All right. Ten to five.

00:58:52.985 --> 00:58:55.807
TALIESIN: Seven and seven. Both seven.

00:58:55.807 --> 00:58:57.139
LIAM: Seven over here as well.

00:58:57.139 --> 00:58:58.017
SAM: Nine over here.

00:58:58.017 --> 00:58:59.262
TRAVIS: Nott, Caduceus, Caleb.

00:58:59.262 --> 00:59:00.807
MATT: Nott and then Cad--

00:59:00.807 --> 00:59:02.134
TRAVIS: I rolled a natural one.

00:59:02.134 --> 00:59:04.047
MATT: Caleb and Jester?

00:59:04.047 --> 00:59:05.408
SAM: Jester had a seven.

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:08.396
MARISHA: Jester--

00:59:08.396 --> 00:59:10.226
MATT: Then Fjord at the bottom.

00:59:10.226 --> 00:59:15.613
LIAM: I'm sorry, Dante, could you please describe
the-- Where everyone is physically, the enemies

00:59:15.613 --> 00:59:18.467
and us? Just so I can see it in my head a bit
better.

00:59:18.467 --> 00:59:20.822
MATT: Awesome. That was my Dante.

00:59:20.822 --> 00:59:21.687
LIAM: Yeah.

00:59:21.687 --> 00:59:25.154
TRAVIS: Want the hourglass gone. They freak me
out.

00:59:25.154 --> 00:59:28.431
MATT: That's okay, it just means you guys are now
in the process of slowly drowning.

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:33.686
TRAVIS: Mercer, don't say that! (groaning)

00:59:33.686 --> 00:59:38.418
SAM: D&D Beyond. And Tor Books everybody. Tor
Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:38.418 --> 00:59:40.599
LIAM and TRAVIS: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:40.599 --> 00:59:41.710
SAM: Nope.

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:43.040
TRAVIS: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.507
SAM: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:44.507 --> 00:59:45.833
MARISHA: Good times.

00:59:45.833 --> 00:59:49.654
TRAVIS: Aw, shit. We're back here again?
Drowning.

00:59:49.654 --> 00:59:51.611
SAM: Except now it's filled with water.

00:59:51.611 --> 00:59:53.436
MATT: It is--

00:59:53.436 --> 00:59:57.975
SAM: Ooh! How did you do that?

00:59:57.975 --> 00:59:59.693
(exclamations)

00:59:59.693 --> 01:00:02.056
MARISHA: Everyone hates the underwater levels.

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:03.824
TALIESIN: They're also drowning too, right?

01:00:03.824 --> 01:00:08.229
MATT: Well, since they're not officially in this--
Now that we are in combat--

01:00:08.229 --> 01:00:11.425
TRAVIS: (water breathing)

01:00:11.425 --> 01:00:13.486
MATT: There is the nature--

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:14.777
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:25.072
MARISHA: Didn't we have some water breathing
potions? Somewhere?

01:00:25.072 --> 01:00:32.780
MATT: Caduceus just made his way up there. There's
Beau, and there's Jamedi.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.607
TALIESIN: Someone might have a water breathing
potion.

01:00:34.607 --> 01:00:40.137
MATT: Top of the initiative order. Beau, you're up
first. While you're in water, movement is

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:49.606
considered difficult terrain. If I recall, attacks
are made at disadvantage while in water.

01:00:49.606 --> 01:00:59.687
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, we're definitely underwater.
Do we see the entrance or exit ahead of us?

01:00:59.687 --> 01:01:01.282
MATT: Those are the stairs that lead upward, yes.

01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:03.676
MARISHA: So, if we just book it, we'll go--

01:01:03.676 --> 01:01:04.911
MATT: Yeah, that's an option.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.016
MARISHA: We're just going to have these guys--

01:01:06.016 --> 01:01:07.653
MATT: That is entirely an option you can do.

01:01:07.653 --> 01:01:15.963
MARISHA: Well, I'm a human with no magical
abilities, so I'm going to run.

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:21.154
LIAM: Also, the trapdoor--

01:01:21.154 --> 01:01:22.935
TRAVIS: (laughter) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:22.935 --> 01:01:24.688
MARISHA: I can't do a whole lot.

01:01:24.688 --> 01:01:26.620
SAM: You have throwing stars.

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.508
MARISHA: (pitiful noise of a throwing star flying
uselessly through water)

01:01:29.508 --> 01:01:30.977
TRAVIS: We haven't given her the key to the
trapdoor.

01:01:30.977 --> 01:01:36.043
LIAM: Ah, <i>ja</i>, son of Sparta, the trapdoor into
this place was like a metal grate, wasn't it? Not

01:01:36.043 --> 01:01:40.557
fully-- like, there were holes? Was it a metal
grate, or was it solid?

01:01:40.557 --> 01:01:45.653
MATT: There were holes above, but they were in the
ceiling, and they were part of the stonework. Up

01:01:45.653 --> 01:01:49.741
top, there was an actual trapdoor that you had
locked behind you.

01:01:49.741 --> 01:01:53.006
LIAM: Yeah, but not like metal with holes for the
water to go through?

01:01:53.006 --> 01:01:53.626
MATT: No.

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:54.615
LIAM: No.

01:01:54.615 --> 01:02:00.857
MATT: That you know of. There are holes above,
which is where the sacrificial blood would drip

01:02:00.857 --> 01:02:05.708
through into the fountain. So, what are you doing,
guys? Are you running first?

01:02:05.708 --> 01:02:06.902
MARISHA: Uh huh.

01:02:06.902 --> 01:02:08.056
MATT: You're swimming?

01:02:08.056 --> 01:02:09.417
MARISHA: I'm swimming up.

01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.125
MATT: (counting)

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.378
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point to do Step
of the Wind.

01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:14.500
MATT: Beau is also--

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.528
TALIESIN: I'm also--

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:17.303
TRAVIS: You've made it up the top.

01:02:17.303 --> 01:02:19.676
SAM: Is she hitting the trapdoor?

01:02:19.676 --> 01:02:23.144
MATT: No, she's not out of the temple. She's
heading up the stairs. She's out of the battle for

01:02:23.144 --> 01:02:24.089
the moment.

01:02:24.089 --> 01:02:25.641
SAM: Got it.

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:30.230
MATT: So that finishes Beau's turn. It is now
their turn. They both rolled really high

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:38.268
initiative, and you guys rolled really terribly.
The malisons closest are going to--

01:02:38.268 --> 01:02:41.031
TALIESIN: Is he getting within 15 feet of me?

01:02:41.031 --> 01:02:41.777
MATT: He is.

01:02:41.777 --> 01:02:44.514
TALIESIN: Okay, then. As he enters that space, he
has to--

01:02:44.514 --> 01:02:47.737
MATT: Well, he's still within 15 feet of you. So
at the top of his turn, he takes the save?

01:02:47.737 --> 01:02:52.422
TALIESIN: Your speed is halved while you're within
15 feet of me, and the creature enters the area

01:02:52.422 --> 01:02:54.469
for the first time or starts its turn there.

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:58.608
MATT: All right. Natural 20 on its save, so it
takes half damage. It still takes damage.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:07.256
TALIESIN: So, the 3d8, that's 19. So, half of 19.

01:03:07.256 --> 01:03:14.646
MATT: So nine. This burst of radiant energy
inside-- (growling) There's bubbles that escape

01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:19.550
from its mouth. It's going to come forward and
take two swipes at you, Fjord, with both of its

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:20.869
serpent hands.

01:03:20.869 --> 01:03:22.274
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:22.274 --> 01:03:26.635
MATT: All right. That is a 16 to hit.

01:03:26.635 --> 01:03:28.148
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:03:28.148 --> 01:03:35.323
MATT: And a natural 20, but it has disadvantage
because it's in water. That is still a 19 to hit.

01:03:35.323 --> 01:03:37.489
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:03:37.489 --> 01:03:41.697
MATT: You do manage to take-- from one serpent,
you just manage to glide out of the way in the

01:03:41.697 --> 01:03:49.099
middle of the water. The second one, that is four
plus three, seven piercing damage, including ten

01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:50.618
points of poison damage.

01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:52.053
TRAVIS: Fuck, ten poison?

01:03:52.053 --> 01:03:53.131
MATT: Yeah.

01:03:53.131 --> 01:03:54.866
TRAVIS: Is it diluted by the water?

01:03:54.866 --> 01:03:58.273
MATT: Unfortunately, no, because it's straight
from the fangs in your bloodstream. It surges pain

01:03:58.273 --> 01:04:05.846
in your chest. You also lose a bit of air
instinctively from the pain. So, consider now,

01:04:05.846 --> 01:04:08.001
your air supply is halved.

01:04:08.001 --> 01:04:10.103
TRAVIS: Okay. Is that half my Constitution
modifier?

01:04:10.103 --> 01:04:14.058
MATT: Essentially, the DC is going higher when we
start getting to that, depending on how long we're

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:15.397
down here.

01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:18.537
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:04:18.537 --> 01:04:21.740
MATT: That ends his go. Now it's the two
broodguards.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.266
SAM: Root guards?

01:04:23.266 --> 01:04:25.065
MATT: Broodguards.

01:04:25.065 --> 01:04:29.678
TALIESIN: Okay, so he gets into my realm-- one of
them is within--

01:04:29.678 --> 01:04:32.666
MATT: They're both already within the radius, so
they both have to make wisdom saves.

01:04:32.666 --> 01:04:35.336
TALIESIN: I don't have to reroll, it's the same
for all three, right?

01:04:35.336 --> 01:04:37.249
MATT: At the top of the turn. It's a different
turn, so roll again.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:39.694
TALIESIN: The roll I just used, or a new roll?

01:04:39.694 --> 01:04:42.423
MATT: No, it's the top of their turn, it happens.

01:04:42.423 --> 01:04:46.302
TALIESIN: All right. That's--

01:04:46.302 --> 01:04:49.099
MATT: Sorry, Spirit Guardians happens at the top
of the turn, it doesn't happen immediately.

01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:52.775
TALIESIN: Yeah, top of their turn.

01:04:52.775 --> 01:04:55.077
MATT: Yeah, at the top of their turn. So the
damage they would've taken this turn, they've

01:04:55.077 --> 01:05:02.138
already taken. So, we'll let that happen. Marking
that down. Good to remember. They both move

01:05:02.138 --> 01:05:05.593
forward. One broodguard is going to attack you,
Nott.

01:05:05.593 --> 01:05:07.100
SAM: Ah!

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.984
MATT: It's going to do two claw attacks and a bite
attack.

01:05:09.984 --> 01:05:10.924
SAM: Oh!

01:05:10.924 --> 01:05:15.948
MATT: Disadvantage on each, though. The first one
is a 15?

01:05:15.948 --> 01:05:17.423
SAM: Miss.

01:05:17.423 --> 01:05:20.667
MATT: One claw attack just goes wide. The other
one, 16.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:21.726
SAM: Hit.

01:05:21.726 --> 01:05:26.308
MATT: One claw. You manage to duck under one. The
other one slams into the side of your body,

01:05:26.308 --> 01:05:31.940
pushing you through the water and down into the
stonework, causing your hip to hit the side.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:38.016
That's going to do four points of slashing damage.
This giant, serpentine mouth out of its weird,

01:05:38.016 --> 01:05:44.033
lizard-like body is going to strike out and bite
you. Oh, two tens. That's 14 to hit.

01:05:44.033 --> 01:05:45.266
SAM: Miss.

01:05:45.266 --> 01:05:49.540
MATT: You manage to push up and jam your hand up
into its jaw and keep it from biting you, and push

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:56.711
it away. The other one's going up towards Yasha.
Yasha was not raging. So the first one with

01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:59.973
disadvantage is 15 to hit?

01:05:59.973 --> 01:06:01.374
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:06.186
MATT: 15 hits. It's going to be a claw attack.
Ooh, eight points of slashing damage.

01:06:06.186 --> 01:06:07.531
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:12.163
MATT: Next attack with a claw with disadvantage,
natural one. That is a complete miss. Yasha takes

01:06:12.163 --> 01:06:16.507
one claw and (grunting) barely affects it. The
other one, she grabs its hand in the middle of the

01:06:16.507 --> 01:06:21.591
grasp and pushes it back. She grabs her sword,
ready now. As she is going to get her blade ready,

01:06:21.591 --> 01:06:27.688
it's going to bite towards the front of her jaw
and chest. That is 17.

01:06:27.688 --> 01:06:30.438
TRAVIS: That hit.

01:06:30.438 --> 01:06:34.098
MATT: She takes six points of piercing damage.

01:06:34.098 --> 01:06:35.860
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.007
MATT: That ends the broodguards' turn. Yasha's up
next.

01:06:39.007 --> 01:06:43.379
TRAVIS: Yasha's up next. Cool. 14 points of
damage.

01:06:43.379 --> 01:06:49.666
MATT: Yasha's also lost quite a bit of air on that
turn. Those two hits that hit her? Mark down two

01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:52.358
hits of oxygen loss on her.

01:06:52.358 --> 01:06:52.948
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:06:52.948 --> 01:06:57.052
MATT: Keeping tabs on this. This will come into
play in a bit, depending on what happens.

01:06:57.052 --> 01:07:01.441
TRAVIS: Where is she on the map?

01:07:01.441 --> 01:07:02.498
MATT: She's right there.

01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:03.647
TRAVIS: Uh huh. She's in melee with someone?

01:07:03.647 --> 01:07:05.369
MATT: She's in melee with the broodguard, yes.

01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:12.200
TRAVIS: (laughter) Okay, she has to fight because
she's going to get hit again, and that would be

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:19.957
bad for her right now. With her bonus action, she
would like to rage. She will take two attacks at

01:07:19.957 --> 01:07:22.868
the one that she's in melee with.

01:07:22.868 --> 01:07:25.786
MATT: She's in a rage? She has the reckless.

01:07:25.786 --> 01:07:27.187
TRAVIS: Already got the reckless.

01:07:27.187 --> 01:07:29.777
MATT: Okay, so that just makes it a straight
attack because she has disadvantage underwater.

01:07:29.777 --> 01:07:32.007
TRAVIS: Oh, balls and ass. Okay.

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:36.788
SAM: (singing) Balls and ass. Ass, ass and balls.

01:07:36.788 --> 01:07:37.957
TRAVIS: 19.

01:07:37.957 --> 01:07:39.864
MATT: Definitely hits.

01:07:42.966 --> 01:07:52.823
TRAVIS: 3d6-- (counting) 13 points of damage for
the first one. The second one is a straight roll,

01:07:52.823 --> 01:07:54.418
the same thing, 19.

01:07:54.418 --> 01:07:56.029
MATT: Yeah, hits. That's just 2d6.

01:07:56.029 --> 01:08:02.585
TRAVIS: 2d6-- again, 13 points of damage.

01:08:02.585 --> 01:08:07.760
MATT: That one's looking really bad. After the
blasts that it took from the Spirit Guardians, and

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.301
the two strikes from Yasha, you can see now
there's a cloud of dark crimson in the water

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:19.365
around it. It's thrashing about in pain. You can
see it looking a bit woozy in the dark water. That

01:08:19.365 --> 01:08:21.065
finishes Yasha? You going to move at all?

01:08:21.065 --> 01:08:22.307
TRAVIS: She will not move at all.

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:26.466
MATT: She can move around it. As long as she stays
in melee, she can still move around.

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:29.777
TRAVIS: We'll come in melee, just more-- closer to
the stairs.

01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:33.232
MATT: I got you. That's what I figured. That
finishes Yasha's turn. Nott's up next.

01:08:33.232 --> 01:08:35.410
SAM: Who had I shot before?

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:36.920
MATT: You had shot this one.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:44.401
SAM: Can I do something unconventional here, Matt,
and undo my last shot? So, give him back 11 points

01:08:44.401 --> 01:08:51.011
of damage. Because I'm holding a keg of gunpowder
and there's no way I can reload a crossbow while

01:08:51.011 --> 01:08:53.404
holding a keg of gunpowder.

01:08:53.404 --> 01:08:56.110
MATT: You can drop it for the moment, fire it, and
pick it back up.

01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:57.112
SAM: All right.

01:08:57.112 --> 01:08:58.575
MATT: I'll let that happen.

01:08:58.575 --> 01:08:59.882
TRAVIS: Good job, Ketchup.

01:08:59.882 --> 01:09:00.513
SAM: All right.

01:09:00.513 --> 01:09:04.529
MATT: Because there is water, and it's already
soaking. It's like-- (splashing, crossbow firing)

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:05.665
SAM: All right.

01:09:05.665 --> 01:09:06.847
MATT: I'll say, narratively, it makes sense.

01:09:06.847 --> 01:09:08.077
LIAM: It's slowly starting to sink

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:18.822
SAM: To the one who's on me, all up in my grill,
I'm going to touch them and cast Shocking Grasp.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:22.718
Which is a--

01:09:22.718 --> 01:09:24.236
MATT: Melee spell attack.

01:09:24.236 --> 01:09:25.871
SAM: Melee spell attack, so I roll at
disadvantage.

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.926
MATT: With disadvantage, yes.

01:09:29.011 --> 01:09:31.080
SAM: Nine plus six, 15.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.191
MATT: 15 hits.

01:09:32.191 --> 01:09:33.187
SAM: Okay, great.

01:09:33.187 --> 01:09:34.900
MATT: AC is 14.

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:41.580
SAM: I've never done this before. Let's see here.
I'm at 5th level, so it's 2d8. What's a d8?

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.881
TALIESIN: It's like a little-- there you go.

01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:46.898
SAM: Hey, eight points of damage!

01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:50.281
MATT: Eight points of damage to it. As you reach
out and grab it-- (electric shock) You watch as

01:09:50.281 --> 01:09:56.644
its tongue retracts into its head and its eyes go
wide. (pained noise) It loses some air, and it

01:09:56.644 --> 01:09:59.428
eventually shakes and pushes off your hand.

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.628
LIAM: It's a verbal spell.

01:10:00.628 --> 01:10:01.653
SAM: A what?

01:10:01.653 --> 01:10:03.146
LIAM: Verbal. You have to speak.

01:10:03.146 --> 01:10:04.330
SAM: Does that work?

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:06.960
MATT: You can do it, but you lose a bunch of air
to do it.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:17.933
SAM: Oh, boy! I hate water. I'm going to swim
away, as fast as I can. I still have to disengage, right?

01:10:17.933 --> 01:10:18.831
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:27.956
SAM: I will bonus action disengage and swim around
past Fjord. Yeah, around this way.

01:10:27.956 --> 01:10:29.204
MATT: This is as far as you can get.

01:10:29.204 --> 01:10:32.003
SAM: Going towards the exits.

01:10:32.003 --> 01:10:33.514
MATT: Swimming over--

01:10:33.514 --> 01:10:34.525
SAM: With one hand.

01:10:34.525 --> 01:10:38.117
MATT: That is your go, Nott. It is now Caduceus,
Caleb, and Jester. You guys can decide amongst

01:10:38.117 --> 01:10:39.583
yourselves the order.

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:41.199
TALIESIN: I'll go last.

01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:46.851
LIAM: I'll go first because I'm scared. I'm going
to use my air to cast Expeditious Retreat on

01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:54.124
myself. So I, too, am going to spit out some air
and do this in the water. That doubles my speed,

01:10:54.124 --> 01:11:00.300
which I can use a bonus action for dashing, plus
my movement. I will swim up five feet and then

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.409
towards the stairs.

01:11:02.409 --> 01:11:11.839
MATT: (counting) That gets you about there.

01:11:11.839 --> 01:11:13.707
LIAM: That's everything.

01:11:13.707 --> 01:11:16.277
MATT: You're right about there on the steps.

01:11:16.277 --> 01:11:16.908
LIAM: I'm dead.

01:11:16.908 --> 01:11:23.064
MATT: Swimming through the air. Okay, that
finishes Caleb's go. What's Jester doing?

01:11:23.064 --> 01:11:27.728
SAM: Jester would like to probably--

01:11:27.728 --> 01:11:30.764
TALIESIN: She's going to lose a little air, but
yeah. Is she engaged with anybody?

01:11:30.764 --> 01:11:33.820
MATT: She's engaged with this broodguard right
there.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:37.506
TALIESIN: Okay, then she will Toll the Dead.

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:39.433
SAM: She will cast Toll the Dead.

01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:40.417
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:42.011
MATT: That's a saving throw for him. What's the
save?

01:11:42.011 --> 01:11:43.620
SAM: 15 wisdom.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:47.484
MATT: That is a 13. That does not do it.

01:11:47.484 --> 01:11:48.914
TALIESIN: That's 2d8.

01:11:48.914 --> 01:11:50.024
MATT: 2d12, I think.

01:11:50.024 --> 01:11:50.976
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 2d12.

01:11:50.976 --> 01:11:52.051
MATT: He's already taken damage.

01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:53.932
TALIESIN: Where are my 12s?

01:11:53.932 --> 01:11:58.987
LIAM: Oh, question: Matt, did you move me two
groups of movement? Because it would be for the

01:11:58.987 --> 01:12:04.478
bonus action, action, and movement. So it'd be one
more third.

01:12:04.478 --> 01:12:05.678
MATT: Casting the spell's a bonus action.

01:12:05.678 --> 01:12:10.266
LIAM: When you cast it, you get that extra juice,
and then bonus action on every following round?

01:12:10.266 --> 01:12:12.749
MATT: Right, so yeah, you'd be up there.

01:12:12.749 --> 01:12:13.886
LIAM: Thank you.

01:12:13.886 --> 01:12:15.246
MATT: There you go. Thank you for the heads up on
that.

01:12:15.246 --> 01:12:16.128
TALIESIN: Ten points.

01:12:16.128 --> 01:12:20.209
MATT: Ten points? Oof. Yeah, he's not looking good
either. They're both looking pretty rough.

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:24.281
TALIESIN: She's going to try to get the most
advantageous point towards the door as well.

01:12:24.281 --> 01:12:32.130
MATT: She is currently-- Both of you, since you
cast spells, mark five points of lost air.

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:35.330
SAM: Five points of lost air.

01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:36.740
LIAM : I'm just going to remember that.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.437
MARISHA: You have five? Total?

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:42.372
MATT: For the purposes of this challenge, to keep
it interesting, five points before you're now

01:12:42.372 --> 01:12:46.751
starting to make-- is now considered how long you
can hold your breath going forward.

01:12:46.751 --> 01:12:49.456
TRAVIS: Oh fuck!

01:12:49.456 --> 01:12:58.185
MATT: Each hit's a minute off the-- I'll have to
look at how I worked it out here. Essentially, at

01:12:58.185 --> 01:13:03.592
this point now, Jester and Nott are going to have
to start making constitution saving throws each round.

01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:05.250
SAM: Awesome.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:10.633
TRAVIS: (panicked breathing) I was not prepared
for this so fast!

01:13:10.633 --> 01:13:15.985
MATT: That finishes Jester's go. She moves around
over there, behind the side. Caduceus, what're you doing?

01:13:15.985 --> 01:13:20.837
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a blight staff swing
at that one that's right next to Yasha.

01:13:20.837 --> 01:13:23.349
MATT: Blight staff swing?

01:13:23.349 --> 01:13:25.173
TALIESIN: Right there.

01:13:25.173 --> 01:13:28.349
SAM: You are a tiny man.

01:13:28.349 --> 01:13:29.811
MATT: Disadvantage on the attack.

01:13:29.811 --> 01:13:32.236
TALIESIN: Oh, actually, that's true. Actually,
never mind. I'm not going to do that, I'm so

01:13:32.236 --> 01:13:36.435
sorry. I'm going to get them into the most
advantageous position to make sure that everybody

01:13:36.435 --> 01:13:39.188
I want to hit is within 15 feet of me.

01:13:39.188 --> 01:13:42.099
MATT: Okay, so you're going to swim up on top of
the fountain.

01:13:42.099 --> 01:13:46.118
TALIESIN: I'm just going to hold my breath and
maintain my calm.

01:13:46.118 --> 01:13:47.567
MATT: Is that all you're doing?

01:13:47.567 --> 01:13:48.626
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:13:48.626 --> 01:13:51.802
MATT: Okay, ends Caduceus' go. Fjord, you're up.

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:58.686
TRAVIS: Wait, can I fire one Eldritch Blast and
make a melee attack?

01:13:58.686 --> 01:14:01.795
MATT: No. It's two Eldritch Blasts or two
strikes.

01:14:01.795 --> 01:14:07.339
TRAVIS: Great. I'm going to fire an Eldritch Blast
at the dick that's with Yasha.

01:14:07.339 --> 01:14:10.929
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack with
disadvantage.

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:16.856
TRAVIS: Nope, that's fine. 16.

01:14:16.856 --> 01:14:19.556
MATT: 16 hits. Roll damage on him.

01:14:21.728 --> 01:14:24.616
TRAVIS: 1d10 for nine points of damage.

01:14:24.616 --> 01:14:27.176
MATT: Nine points of damage, all righty.

01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:28.707
TRAVIS: Is he still up?

01:14:28.707 --> 01:14:31.345
MATT: Still up. Hurt, but still up.

01:14:31.345 --> 01:14:33.163
TRAVIS: I will send the other one that way as
well.

01:14:33.163 --> 01:14:34.345
MATT: Go for it.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:38.268
TRAVIS: I can't let Ash's character die. Awesome,
16.

01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:40.396
MATT: 16 hits again. Roll damage.

01:14:42.985 --> 01:14:44.720
TRAVIS: For 11 points of damage.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.998
MATT: 11 points of damage. That'll do it. You hear
the dull impact of the Eldritch Blast, and the

01:14:49.998 --> 01:14:55.497
second (impact) under the water. In that flash of
light, that second sickly, green glow flash in the

01:14:55.497 --> 01:15:02.611
water, one of the broodguards begins to float up
limply towards the ceiling, no longer alive.

01:15:02.611 --> 01:15:05.936
SAM: Check his body for gold!

01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:14.951
TRAVIS: I'm going to move away. I'm going to use
my 30 feet and take an attack of opportunity as I do.

01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:23.079
MATT: That will get you right about there on the
stairs. There you go, that'll do. You'll swim

01:15:23.079 --> 01:15:30.184
right there; that's perfect. It does get to swipe
at you with disadvantage. That's going to be nine

01:15:30.184 --> 01:15:36.805
plus five, that's 14.

01:15:36.805 --> 01:15:38.079
TRAVIS: So it misses?

01:15:38.079 --> 01:15:46.104
MATT: It does! It scrapes across your shield as
you swim away quickly, just barely making it! That

01:15:46.104 --> 01:15:48.275
finishes your turn, Fjord. Beau, you're up.

01:15:48.275 --> 01:15:51.415
MARISHA: Okay, what do I see? Where am I? Quick
look around!

01:15:51.415 --> 01:15:55.074
MATT: You're going up the staircase, but you're
part way up.

01:15:55.074 --> 01:15:56.497
MARISHA: The water's still filling?

01:15:56.497 --> 01:16:00.530
MATT: Yeah, still filling, and it's still above
you, like you can maybe catch up to the top if you

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:05.264
want to. If you use your full movement, you'll get
up to the top where the door is.

01:16:05.264 --> 01:16:09.685
MARISHA: I'm going to keep moving upwards, and
while I'm doing that, I want to take out the

01:16:09.685 --> 01:16:18.651
50-foot rope we have. Then I want to grab
something heavy that I have. I've got to have

01:16:18.651 --> 01:16:24.288
something stupid and heavy that I don't care
about, and I want to tie it to the other end. A

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:29.138
crowbar! I take the crowbar and then tie it, and I
drop it down the well with the rope.

01:16:29.138 --> 01:16:30.726
MATT: Downstairs, you mean?

01:16:30.726 --> 01:16:31.795
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:36.563
MATT: You tie, take the crowbar and throw it
behind so it's like (bouncing) and rolls partway

01:16:36.563 --> 01:16:37.867
down the stairs.

01:16:37.867 --> 01:16:42.428
MARISHA: I want to take the rope and double-grab
it around me and keep hauling ass up the stairs.

01:16:42.428 --> 01:16:47.737
MATT: Okay, with that, you'll make it all the way
to the top. You get to the small inner chamber,

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:50.833
which is now halfway to stomach-filled. Making it
to the top, you look up and you can see there is--

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:56.276
it's a little bit crouch-down, there is the latch,
and there is the lock mechanism beneath it.

01:16:56.276 --> 01:16:58.957
MARISHA: Fuck! It's locked?

01:16:58.957 --> 01:17:01.888
MATT: Yeah. You locked it behind you when you guys
entered the temple.

01:17:01.888 --> 01:17:03.579
TRAVIS: Who has the fucking key? One of us has the
key; who has the key?

01:17:03.579 --> 01:17:05.039
MARISHA: Is there a key? Where's the key?

01:17:05.039 --> 01:17:06.514
TRAVIS: Who found the key?

01:17:06.514 --> 01:17:11.098
MATT: Somebody found the key. It was on one of the
guys from the first encounter of this chamber.

01:17:11.098 --> 01:17:15.030
SAM: Snake temple key! It says it right here on
the equipment list. Jester has it!

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:17.557
MARISHA: Jester has the key!

01:17:17.557 --> 01:17:25.505
MATT: Well, it's their turn now. The malison going
to make its saving throw. That's going to be a 14.

01:17:25.505 --> 01:17:26.950
What's the DC?

01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:34.117
TALIESIN: I believe that's full damage. Let's see.
Spirit Guardians? 16!

01:17:34.117 --> 01:17:38.745
MATT: 16? So roll full damage on that. 3d8.

01:17:38.745 --> 01:17:44.394
TALIESIN: Not bad. 16 points.

01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:51.685
MATT: 16 points of damage. Ooh, he's looking
really bad.

01:17:51.685 --> 01:17:55.628
TALIESIN: Are the other two not doing anything, by
the way?

01:17:55.628 --> 01:17:58.420
MATT: When it comes to their turn. One of them's
dead now.

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:02.232
TALIESIN: No, I mean our other two friends.

01:18:02.232 --> 01:18:05.977
MATT: The other two, their turn's next. We'll get
to that when he finishes his turn, but one of them

01:18:05.977 --> 01:18:07.707
is dead, so there's only one other guy.

01:18:07.707 --> 01:18:08.708
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:14.241
MATT: The malison, in a burst of angry pixies
swarming around his body, is looking really hurt.

01:18:14.241 --> 01:18:20.425
As he moves around, the trail of blood stays in
the water behind the head as it shifts around.

01:18:20.425 --> 01:18:25.464
Both of the serpent arms look up towards Caduceus,
the source of these angry spirits, and is going to

01:18:25.464 --> 01:18:27.758
make two strikes against him.

01:18:27.758 --> 01:18:29.305
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:34.987
MATT: Because you're the one right there. That is
13 to hit?

01:18:34.987 --> 01:18:36.500
TALIESIN: Nope!

01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:42.293
MATT: Second strike, that's a 12!

01:18:42.293 --> 01:18:44.176
TALIESIN: Nope!

01:18:44.176 --> 01:18:54.178
MATT: It's like 18, six; 16, eight. Bad rolls!
Both serpent strikes from its arms reach out

01:18:54.178 --> 01:18:58.360
towards you, and Caduceus, you're tiny enough
right now. Although, are you still holding the

01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.839
tiny spell on Caduceus?

01:18:59.839 --> 01:19:01.679
LIAM: I have not released it yet, no.

01:19:01.679 --> 01:19:03.569
MATT: Is Expeditious Retreat concentration?

01:19:03.569 --> 01:19:07.255
LIAM: Oh, is it? 'Tis, so it's dropped, so he's
regular size.

01:19:07.255 --> 01:19:12.382
MATT: Okay, so you're regular form, and you bear
down with the shield, and deflect both.

01:19:12.382 --> 01:19:13.956
TALIESIN: Just letting the fairies do the work.

01:19:13.956 --> 01:19:21.200
MATT: Bits of green and pinkish lichen torn off
and float away in the water away from the strikes.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:28.658
That finishes its go. The other broodguard has to
make another save, that is a seven plus-- no, that

01:19:28.658 --> 01:19:30.938
does not make it, so full damage on the other
broodguard.

01:19:30.938 --> 01:19:33.126
TRAVIS: Are we getting the impression that they're
totally comfortable underwater?

01:19:33.126 --> 01:19:38.259
MATT: No, actually.

01:19:38.259 --> 01:19:39.984
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:41.025
MATT: 15 points of damage, that'll do it.

01:19:41.025 --> 01:19:42.481
TRAVIS: Ooh, it does?

01:19:42.481 --> 01:19:46.551
MATT: This guy also sparks and dies in the water.

01:19:46.551 --> 01:19:50.140
MARISHA: Go Jester, go Jester, go!

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:56.621
MATT: That's Caduceus' spell. That finishes their
go. Yasha's up.

01:19:56.621 --> 01:20:04.484
TRAVIS: Yasha will fucking hi-ho silver out that
bitch! She has 40 feet, so 20--

01:20:04.484 --> 01:20:08.268
TALIESIN: Oh no. She's out, I thought. She's out!

01:20:08.268 --> 01:20:15.011
MATT: Okay. Got you. (counting) Then moving the
rest way up, that will get her halfway up the

01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:17.406
steps. Put her there.

01:20:17.406 --> 01:20:19.300
TALIESIN: Yeah, get her out of there.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:22.392
MATT: Okay. Finishing Yasha's turn, Nott, you're
up.

01:20:22.392 --> 01:20:23.343
SAM: Oh boy.

01:20:23.343 --> 01:20:27.391
TALIESIN: I would appreciate it, but up to you.

01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:32.168
SAM: Man, I really don't like this water.

01:20:32.168 --> 01:20:34.167
TALIESIN: No. No one does.

01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:38.484
SAM: Oh boy, all right.

01:20:38.484 --> 01:20:41.584
MATT: Shades of the kraken battle returning.

01:20:41.584 --> 01:20:44.635
TRAVIS: Are Avantika and Jamedi doing anything?

01:20:44.635 --> 01:20:52.777
SAM: I will doggy paddle towards the snake-hand
man and hit him with another zap.

01:20:52.777 --> 01:20:55.221
MATT: Jamedi has essentially just swam around this
whole thing--

01:20:55.221 --> 01:21:00.286
TALIESIN: Asshole!

01:21:00.286 --> 01:21:04.465
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, Avantika
has, at this point, swept up and taken her turn

01:21:04.465 --> 01:21:09.791
that she should have taken before and is going to
take three strikes against the malison. That's my

01:21:09.791 --> 01:21:18.980
own fault, but we'll see. With disadvantage.
That's cocked. That still hits because its armor

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:27.318
class is only 12. Ten points of damage. Second
strike with the rapier, disadvantage. That does

01:21:27.318 --> 01:21:35.140
not hit! The dagger strike-- no. Misses again!
Swinging out, piercing through the water with the

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:40.427
rapier and the dagger and just to scrape across
the side of its body but most of the strikes go

01:21:40.427 --> 01:21:44.566
wide and she's swimming around this way.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:47.000
TALIESIN: Is he going to take an attack of
opportunity on her?

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.730
MATT: No, she's still staying in combat. She moved
around him but is staying engaged but is currently

01:21:51.730 --> 01:21:57.663
looking to make another opening and then dive off
back towards the stairs. Nott, sorry, your turn now.

01:21:57.968 --> 01:22:00.649
SAM: Okay, my turn. Do I need to first make a
constitution save?

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:01.832
MATT: At the end of your turn.

01:22:01.832 --> 01:22:07.923
SAM: At the end of my turn, okay. I'll swim up and
poke the thing with my shortsword.

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:13.003
MATT: You swim up a bit there. Go for it.
Disadvantage on the attack.

01:22:13.003 --> 01:22:18.135
SAM: Oh boy. Okay. What does this thing do? 15!

01:22:18.135 --> 01:22:23.010
MATT: 15 hits, and engaged with allies. You do get
sneak attack damage.

01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:24.379
SAM: Oh? I do?!

01:22:24.379 --> 01:22:28.711
MATT: Yeah. It's engaged with Caduceus and
Avantika.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:35.955
SAM: Oh wow. Okay. That's 21 points of damage.

01:22:35.955 --> 01:22:38.926
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:22:38.926 --> 01:22:48.427
SAM: Because it can't see me, I'll go up and-- I
don't use shortsword a lot, so I'll let it float

01:22:48.427 --> 01:22:54.521
for a second and grab it from behind and then rake
it across the back of its neck.

01:22:54.521 --> 01:22:59.369
MATT: As you do, you pierce past all the humanoid
muscles across the neck and its shoulders.

01:22:59.369 --> 01:23:04.712
Immediately, the water before you fills with
crimson. You can see it thrash for a minute, its

01:23:04.712 --> 01:23:10.876
serpent arms trying to reach behind to strike at
you. You swim away as they go limp, and it begins

01:23:10.876 --> 01:23:16.278
to float up. So that's that. You still have a
little movement left.

01:23:16.278 --> 01:23:19.307
SAM: I'm going to go towards the door as much as I
can.

01:23:19.307 --> 01:23:24.304
MATT: That is about as far as you can get. With
dash, you can get up there so you're with Fjord.

01:23:24.304 --> 01:23:26.936
Make a constitution saving throw, please.

01:23:26.936 --> 01:23:30.245
SAM: Not great. 12.

01:23:30.245 --> 01:23:36.443
MATT: You are not drowning yet, but you're on the
cusp.

01:23:36.443 --> 01:23:40.519
SAM: That's my favorite condition: is not drowning
yet.

01:23:40.519 --> 01:23:45.453
MATT: That ends your go, Nott. Caduceus, Caleb,
and Jester, you're up.

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.339
TALIESIN: Full speed.

01:23:47.339 --> 01:23:50.455
TRAVIS: Yeah, the same with Jester. All the way up
to the dome.

01:23:50.455 --> 01:23:52.875
SAM: (Jester voice) She's going to cast Mending.

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:57.545
(laughter)

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.144
MATT: She's up with Fjord, and I need you to make
a constitution saving throw for Jester.

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:06.182
SAM: Seven plus-- nine.

01:24:06.182 --> 01:24:07.252
TRAVIS: 16!

01:24:07.252 --> 01:24:10.575
SAM: No. Seven plus two equals nine.

01:24:10.575 --> 01:24:11.713
TRAVIS: Shit!

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:15.207
MATT: Caduceus, I need you to make one too.
because you did cast a spell, Spirit Guardians,

01:24:15.207 --> 01:24:16.508
while underwater.

01:24:16.508 --> 01:24:18.155
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. That's fair, I did.

01:24:18.155 --> 01:24:19.759
SAM: She rolled a nine.

01:24:19.759 --> 01:24:26.640
MATT: She rolled nine total. Jester's drowning.
You see her swimming. She's (choking) and begins

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.460
kicking in the water before starting to--

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.131
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight.

01:24:31.131 --> 01:24:36.081
MATT: You rolled an eight? Caduceus as well. They
both swim towards the staircase and you see them

01:24:36.081 --> 01:24:38.733
both beginning to clutch at their throats.

01:24:38.733 --> 01:24:42.799
TALIESIN: Can I cast-- I got a crazy idea.

01:24:42.799 --> 01:24:44.879
MATT: You used your full movement to get there.

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:47.684
TALIESIN: Next turn can I try something?

01:24:47.684 --> 01:24:50.972
SAM: Next turn, you'll be dead.

01:24:50.972 --> 01:24:56.701
MATT: Next turn, you're going to be unconscious.
Ending your go, Caleb, what are you doing?

01:24:56.701 --> 01:25:02.555
LIAM: So I have three ways to move. First way is
the bonus action. Do I reach oxygen doing that?

01:25:03.831 --> 01:25:06.033
MATT: You can get up to the front there.

01:25:06.033 --> 01:25:07.700
LIAM: Does that get me to air?

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.954
MATT: It gets you to the last bit of air as it's
about to hit the surface. At the end of this

01:25:10.954 --> 01:25:15.124
combat round, basically after Fjord, the chamber
that Beau is in is now full. The water has filled

01:25:15.124 --> 01:25:16.577
the entirety of the temple.

01:25:16.577 --> 01:25:18.547
LIAM: So all the way to the tippy-top?

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:19.150
MATT: Yes.

01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:25.034
LIAM: Oh, balls. I'll use bonus action and
movement to go as high as I can. Do I reach the

01:25:25.034 --> 01:25:26.912
trap door?

01:25:26.912 --> 01:25:29.192
MATT: You do reach the door.

01:25:29.192 --> 01:25:34.049
LIAM: I will pull out the wire from my spell
components and try to jimmy to lock. Oh god, I

01:25:34.049 --> 01:25:40.764
don't know what to do! I'm underwater, yeah? So I
still have action, so I'm going to try to open the lock.

01:25:40.783 --> 01:25:43.875
MATT: Okay. Make a lock picking attempt.

01:25:43.875 --> 01:25:46.200
SAM: This will be no problem, right?

01:25:46.664 --> 01:25:47.623
LIAM: Straight roll?

01:25:47.623 --> 01:25:50.580
MATT: No, disadvantage because you're underwater.

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:58.229
LIAM: Oh, it's so good. Natural 20 and a three.
That's a four.

01:25:58.229 --> 01:26:04.048
MATT: No, that's a failure. You're sticking,
trying to get through it. No effect. Fjord, you're up.

01:26:04.048 --> 01:26:09.449
TRAVIS: Okay. Looking around, still having plenty
of air in my lungs, I turn around and see Jester

01:26:09.449 --> 01:26:15.670
starting to panic and I know that she has the key,
so I will reach out and grab her face and bring

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:21.024
her into a kiss, and I will blow all of my air
into her lungs.

01:26:21.024 --> 01:26:24.107
SAM: Are you upside down right now?

01:26:24.107 --> 01:26:27.120
TRAVIS: Shape of Water!

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.093
SAM: Oh, yes!

01:26:29.093 --> 01:26:33.266
MATT: She is no longer drowning, but you have to
make a con save at the end of your turn.

01:26:33.266 --> 01:26:35.033
TRAVIS: Okay. Fair enough.

01:26:35.033 --> 01:26:40.062
MATT: That's your action to do that. You breathe
some of your air into her. You still have movement.

01:26:40.644 --> 01:26:42.328
MARISHA: He selfishly wants the door unlocked--

01:26:42.328 --> 01:26:44.294
TRAVIS: I'll try and swim up towards the top.

01:26:44.294 --> 01:26:47.398
MATT: You make it halfway up. Actually, no,
because you have full move, don't you?

01:26:47.398 --> 01:26:48.437
TRAVIS: Full movement.

01:26:48.437 --> 01:26:51.095
MATT: You get almost to the top. Not fully, but
almost to the top. Constitution saving throw, please.

01:26:52.286 --> 01:26:54.415
TRAVIS: Nine.

01:26:54.415 --> 01:26:57.517
MATT: You, sir, are considered drowning.

01:26:57.517 --> 01:27:05.439
LIAM: I lost five of those hoo-has for casting a
spell, you said, so do I need to make a

01:27:05.439 --> 01:27:06.782
constitution throw?

01:27:06.782 --> 01:27:07.905
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:27:07.905 --> 01:27:10.679
LIAM: Okay, let's all die together. 13.

01:27:10.679 --> 01:27:22.556
MATT: You're fine. That brings around to the top
there. Beau, the water fills the gap.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.973
MARISHA: Take one last deep breath. Going to drop
down and going to use that-- nope, the rope is

01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:30.999
attached to me. Going to drop down and see if I
can go for Jester.

01:27:30.999 --> 01:27:36.652
MATT: Okay. So you're going to pull Jester up?
She's conscious, so you're going to get her closer?

01:27:36.652 --> 01:27:38.944
MARISHA: Yeah, can I take her and yank her up with
me?

01:27:38.944 --> 01:27:45.950
MATT: Sure. You go down. Takes you I'll say two
movements to get down there and you pull her part

01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:48.302
way up. Are you using your ki point for step of
the wind?

01:27:48.302 --> 01:27:49.984
MARISHA: Sure. My last ki point.

01:27:49.984 --> 01:27:54.416
MATT: Last ki point will do that. That will get
her halfway up the stairs because I'm saying

01:27:54.416 --> 01:27:59.703
pulling her, the dragging motion, is half
movement. So that will get you down to her. Yeah,

01:27:59.703 --> 01:28:03.416
you'll get her part way up the stairs, about
halfway up toward where the top chamber is.

01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:05.447
MARISHA: That helps. Whatever I can do, I guess.

01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:08.618
LIAM: If there was air where Beau was, wouldn't
there be air where Caleb was?

01:28:08.618 --> 01:28:10.819
MARISHA: No, you were below me, I think.

01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:17.079
LIAM: I'm hasted almost, and I just blasted up to
the top of the temple.

01:28:17.079 --> 01:28:19.914
MATT: It did. Okay, no. I would say that there was
enough air.

01:28:19.914 --> 01:28:22.235
LIAM: Then I would have (inhaling). Then I failed
the lock picking.

01:28:22.235 --> 01:28:31.700
MATT: Thank you. So you're fine. Ends Beau's turn.
That brings us to Yasha. Avantika has also swam up

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:39.237
and Jamedi is now gathering as well. Jamedi and
Avantika both grab Caduceus' body, who is

01:28:39.237 --> 01:28:41.774
drowning, and begin pulling him up the stairs
behind them.

01:28:41.774 --> 01:28:44.306
MARISHA: That's good. That's nice of them.

01:28:44.306 --> 01:28:48.646
TRAVIS: Yasha will head towards the door and wait
for it to open. She's going to use her movement to

01:28:48.646 --> 01:28:49.504
go up.

01:28:49.504 --> 01:28:55.293
MATT: Yasha gets up there to the top. Yasha's now
in there, waiting there in the chamber. There's

01:28:55.422 --> 01:28:59.208
the gate below getting ready, looking around,
trying to get people to move upward. That finishes

01:28:59.208 --> 01:29:00.869
her go. Nott.

01:29:00.869 --> 01:29:06.647
SAM: I will grab Jester's horns and pull and go up
as fast as I can.

01:29:06.647 --> 01:29:14.983
MATT: You use half your movement to catch up to
Jester, where Beau is, and then you grab her with

01:29:14.983 --> 01:29:17.898
the little bit of movement. You move her an
additional five feet before your movement is done.

01:29:17.898 --> 01:29:20.004
You can attempt to bonus action dash.

01:29:20.004 --> 01:29:21.515
SAM: Bonus action dash. Sure, yeah.

01:29:21.515 --> 01:29:25.800
MATT: You get another 15 feet. You get her near
the top of the staircase on the top floor. That

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.836
ends your turn, Nott. Now it is Jester's, Caleb's,
and Caduceus' turn. Caduceus. You are unconscious.

01:29:32.213 --> 01:29:33.753
TALIESIN: I am unconscious. Ah, man!

01:29:33.753 --> 01:29:39.294
MATT: I need you to make a death save at the top
of your turn. I need to keep reminding myself that

01:29:39.294 --> 01:29:40.704
death saves are at the top of the turn, not in
the--

01:29:40.704 --> 01:29:44.271
TALIESIN: I know, I was just sitting on a spell
that apparently I didn't know that I was going to

01:29:44.271 --> 01:29:50.888
lose the spell so I'm throwing away my plans. I
had an emergency exit and now I can't use it. It's

01:29:50.888 --> 01:29:57.822
all right. Fuck it. 14.

01:29:57.822 --> 01:30:04.063
MATT: Success on the save. That finishes Caduceus'
turn. Caleb and Jester.

01:30:04.326 --> 01:30:08.614
LIAM: I'm taking a breath of air. Caleb would have
just rebounded back down and swam. I use bonus

01:30:08.895 --> 01:30:13.020
action if that gets me to them, good. If not, I
will use bonus action plus movement to get to them

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:17.686
which I would assume it would get me there. Then I
help Nott. I will continue to drag Jester up

01:30:17.686 --> 01:30:18.883
towards the surface.

01:30:18.883 --> 01:30:21.994
MATT: Between all of you guys, Jester and you all
manage to make your way up the top and Jester's

01:30:21.994 --> 01:30:27.826
turn-- Jester fumbles through her sack, pulls up
the key and gets it. So--

01:30:27.826 --> 01:30:29.240
SAM: So it works.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.155
MATT: This is how the ending of the first Poseidon
movie <i>should</i> have happened.

01:30:33.155 --> 01:30:34.671
(laughter)

01:30:34.671 --> 01:30:36.091
TRAVIS: First Poseidon movie, yeah!

01:30:36.091 --> 01:30:38.780
MATT: Because all of this water pressure just
built up at the top of this temple suddenly

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:49.009
released as the latch and this geyser of water
thrusts all of you rapidly out the top.

01:30:49.009 --> 01:30:50.718
SAM: Money shot!

01:30:50.718 --> 01:30:52.552
MARISHA: (groaning) Oh god!

01:30:52.552 --> 01:30:58.298
MATT: You all get shot about a good 15, 20 feet
up.

01:30:58.298 --> 01:30:59.709
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

01:30:59.709 --> 01:31:06.888
MATT: You have a look down at the temple, which
you can now see these large cracks that have set

01:31:06.888 --> 01:31:12.080
in the sides where bits of water are pouring out
through small cracks. Now this large geyser thrusts

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.967
in the air and you all began to plummet and fall.

01:31:14.967 --> 01:31:18.389
LIAM: I cast Feather Fall on myself, on Nott, on
Jester, on Beauregard, and on Fjord.

01:31:18.389 --> 01:31:19.393
MATT: Okay.

01:31:19.393 --> 01:31:20.953
LIAM: It's my last spell slot.

01:31:20.953 --> 01:31:22.434
MARISHA: Take Cad, take Cad! I'm good!

01:31:22.434 --> 01:31:26.160
LIAM: I already did it, it doesn't matter. It's
what I did. It's who I know, not what hit points exist.

01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:28.105
SAM: I cast Feather Fall on everyone else.

01:31:28.105 --> 01:31:31.076
(cheering)

01:31:31.076 --> 01:31:33.925
TALIESIN: Thank god. That would have been the end
of me.

01:31:33.925 --> 01:31:35.488
TRAVIS: That would have been it.

01:31:35.488 --> 01:31:39.266
TALIESIN: That would have been number two, done.
Right there, instant T.K.O.

01:31:39.266 --> 01:31:41.039
SAM: I throw a wet feather.

01:31:41.039 --> 01:31:43.695
(laughter)

01:31:43.695 --> 01:31:44.458
MATT: Perfect.

01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:45.888
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

01:31:45.888 --> 01:31:51.536
MATT: As you all begin to drift down, the geyser
slows, the pressure releases, but now water is

01:31:51.536 --> 01:31:58.580
just pouring out of the sides of the temple and
it's completely flooding the city. You watch as

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:03.472
yuan-ti that are rushing up the side of the temple
are washed down into the basin that is now the

01:32:03.472 --> 01:32:08.709
center of the city streets. You can see now that
the city is being thrust up the side. Some have

01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:12.325
moved to the top of buildings and are glancing up
and seeing you guys as you begin to descend. Now

01:32:12.325 --> 01:32:16.964
you're about to hit the top of this, and there is
now a perpetual flow of water coming out of the

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:19.713
top of this temple. What are you going to do?

01:32:19.713 --> 01:32:22.923
SAM: We're about to hit the top of the temple, or
all the sides of it?

01:32:22.923 --> 01:32:27.245
MATT: On the sides of it. You guys are just slowly
drifting down towards what's essentially a raging--

01:32:28.491 --> 01:32:29.294
TRAVIS: Water slide?

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:31.380
MATT: Rapid water slide on all ends.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:35.742
MARISHA: It ends with the mob of angry people who
want to kill us, probably?

01:32:35.742 --> 01:32:36.482
MATT: Correct.

01:32:36.482 --> 01:32:38.374
LIAM: I can see that.

01:32:38.374 --> 01:32:41.829
TALIESIN: Jester at the very least is going to
cast Spare the Dying-- is going to grab me in the

01:32:41.829 --> 01:32:43.550
Feather Fall and cast Spare the Dying.

01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:44.160
MATT: Okay.

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.340
TALIESIN: Thank you!

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:46.946
TRAVIS: I'm unconscious, I think.

01:32:46.946 --> 01:32:50.138
TALIESIN: I don't think you made it to
unconsciousness because we burst before your turn.

01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:51.481
TRAVIS: Okay, okay.

01:32:51.481 --> 01:32:52.819
SAM: No, you're unconscious.

01:32:52.819 --> 01:32:54.482
TRAVIS: I started drowning.

01:32:54.482 --> 01:32:55.156
MATT: Yeah.

01:32:55.156 --> 01:32:56.802
MARISHA: But I don't know if you're making death
saves. Is he stable?

01:32:56.802 --> 01:32:58.990
MATT: No, because we haven't gone to his turn yet.
You've begun drowning and you guys got thrust out,

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:02.185
so you managed just catch your breath because it
didn't come back to your turn yet. That very next

01:33:02.185 --> 01:33:05.941
turn, before Jester got it opened, you've would
have been down.

01:33:05.941 --> 01:33:06.922
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:33:06.922 --> 01:33:08.495
MATT: So you just caught your breath--

01:33:08.495 --> 01:33:09.686
TRAVIS: I did? Okay, okay.

01:33:09.686 --> 01:33:13.278
MATT: The very last minute. Basically, as the
darkness began to take your vision, you are thrust

01:33:13.278 --> 01:33:20.767
out and your eyes go wide again as you see this
sunlight above you as your air rushes back into

01:33:20.767 --> 01:33:25.619
your lungs and then suddenly begin to drift slowly
down looking below-- you can see the city and the

01:33:25.619 --> 01:33:29.611
entire landscape of this strange village below
you.

01:33:29.611 --> 01:33:31.653
MARISHA: How the fuck do we get out of this?

01:33:31.653 --> 01:33:33.157
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

01:33:33.157 --> 01:33:35.380
LIAM: They are on all sides, the people down
below, or are down on one side of them?

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:38.014
MATT: They are on all sides. Like the entire city
surrounds the temple. You guys only came up on one

01:33:38.014 --> 01:33:40.724
side. The water is pouring down on all sides.

01:33:40.724 --> 01:33:42.583
TRAVIS: Let's us just get down and out of here.

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:47.897
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I don't think that Spirit
Guardians doesn't go down when I go unconscious.

01:33:47.897 --> 01:33:49.878
MATT: Any spells that's concentration is lost.

01:33:49.878 --> 01:33:52.998
TALIESIN: It's not concentration-- Oh it is
concentration, isn't it? Where is it?

01:33:52.998 --> 01:33:55.706
Yeah, it is concentration. Fuck. God
damn it.

01:33:55.707 --> 01:33:57.601
TRAVIS: Let's just get back on the ship.

01:33:57.601 --> 01:34:00.586
LIAM: I'm paddling through the air towards the
direction we came from.

01:34:00.586 --> 01:34:01.412
MARISHA: Haul ass.

01:34:01.412 --> 01:34:05.035
SAM: As we're in the air, I'm going to take the
shield that I stole off my back, and slide it

01:34:05.035 --> 01:34:06.698
under Caduceus' butt like a--

01:34:06.698 --> 01:34:09.875
(laughter)

01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:15.681
SAM: A sled. Like a toboggan and hold it there so
when he lands he'll just slide.

01:34:15.681 --> 01:34:21.263
MATT: Okay. So as you all begin to slowly drift
and try paddling your way through the air, I'm

01:34:21.263 --> 01:34:25.697
going to say for the purpose of this, we'll make
this a group skill check. Everyone, make a

01:34:25.697 --> 01:34:31.395
dexterity check to try and comb your way through
the air enough. Using your body to try and guide

01:34:31.395 --> 01:34:32.811
your plummeting.

01:34:34.029 --> 01:34:34.625
TRAVIS: 12.

01:34:35.578 --> 01:34:36.723
MARISHA: 24.

01:34:36.723 --> 01:34:37.689
LIAM: <i>Drei</i>.

01:34:37.689 --> 01:34:39.379
SAM: It doesn't matter, you're out.

01:34:39.379 --> 01:34:40.848
MATT: Two successes, failure.

01:34:40.848 --> 01:34:42.333
TALIESIN: No I'm not, I'm unconscious.

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:44.123
TALIESIN: I'm stable! That's right, I'm
unconscious! Never mind.

01:34:44.123 --> 01:34:44.813
MATT: You're fine.

01:34:44.813 --> 01:34:45.481
SAM: Natural 20.

01:34:45.481 --> 01:34:48.146
MATT: Success. Three successes, one failure.
Jester--

01:34:48.146 --> 01:34:49.800
SAM: 18 plus.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.464
MATT: Success on Jester. For Yasha?

01:34:52.464 --> 01:34:53.242
TRAVIS: 18.

01:34:53.242 --> 01:34:59.997
MATT: Success, all right! So only one fail. As a
group, that is a group success. So you all manage

01:34:59.997 --> 01:35:07.331
to just-- Yep, and both Jamedi and Avantika are
fine. So, you all manage to just barely push your

01:35:07.331 --> 01:35:09.069
way in a certain direction, you all begin to drift
down--

01:35:09.069 --> 01:35:11.514
SAM: Like a skydiving team?

01:35:11.514 --> 01:35:18.735
MATT: Yeah, slowly making your way through, until
eventually the surface of the water, the rushing

01:35:18.735 --> 01:35:24.441
sound gets louder and louder as you all strike it!
As you do, it carries you down in this rapid

01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:29.980
Goonies-style waterslide, you're all coasting down
the side of the stones, and elements of the stone

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:34.708
just barely scraping and clipping the back of your
butt and your back and you're like "Oh god!", it's

01:35:34.708 --> 01:35:37.818
not enough to damage you but you're going to be
bruised as shit in the morning, but you're

01:35:37.818 --> 01:35:41.581
coasting down, you can see as the city is coming
towards you, the water is now pouring through and

01:35:41.581 --> 01:35:47.416
snaking through the city-- no pun intended-- there
are groups of yuan-ti that have clamored up onto

01:35:47.416 --> 01:35:51.063
the buildings and are currently trying to pull
themselves out of the water and help others get up

01:35:51.063 --> 01:35:56.946
out of the middle of this strange flood that has
taken over the center of their civilization.

01:35:56.946 --> 01:35:58.524
SAM: The water's still coming, right?

01:35:58.524 --> 01:36:00.187
MATT: It's still pouring out of the temple it
seems.

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:02.204
SAM: Oh my god, the island is sinking.

01:36:02.204 --> 01:36:05.806
TRAVIS: Potentially, if this an island.

01:36:05.806 --> 01:36:08.122
SAM: It's a turtle's back!

01:36:08.122 --> 01:36:10.969
MARISHA: Turtle! It's only a turtle!

01:36:10.969 --> 01:36:13.549
SAM: It's the Cajun turtle!

01:36:13.549 --> 01:36:15.936
MATT: Orly's vengeance!

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.760
TRAVIS: You fools!

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:24.210
MATT: You guys coast down, you hit the bottom, and
you can see now where the water hits and it snakes

01:36:24.210 --> 01:36:27.098
through, it curves back to the right and the left,
which path are you going to try to guide towards?

01:36:27.098 --> 01:36:28.159
TRAVIS: Right!

01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:30.145
MATT: You have an unconscious, sledding furbolg.

01:36:30.145 --> 01:36:31.522
TALIESIN: You're sliding me, basically?

01:36:31.522 --> 01:36:35.220
SAM: I feel like I'm behind you because I've got
water walking on, so I'm like--

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:37.920
MATT: You do it's like (brrrrrrrrr).

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.911
LIAM: I have keen mind, I would call out exactly
the right way to go.

01:36:39.911 --> 01:36:41.931
MATT: It's almost like curling!

01:36:41.931 --> 01:36:44.299
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

01:36:44.299 --> 01:36:47.252
LIAM: I have keen mind, I would know the way that
would lead us towards the way we came.

01:36:47.252 --> 01:36:49.094
MATT: Yes you would, so you're guiding and
shouting directions?

01:36:49.094 --> 01:36:51.480
LIAM: <i>Ja!</i> That way! Go that way!

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:57.168
MATT: Caleb's guiding you guys, you guys move
around the side, riding the water. At this point

01:36:57.252 --> 01:37:04.657
the flood of water begins to subside a bit. It's
still guiding you through, but you can see now the

01:37:04.657 --> 01:37:09.383
initial burst and rushing of the rapids is not a
continuous thing, there is some sort of a tapering

01:37:09.383 --> 01:37:16.107
to it. You guys just managed to have been there
for the initial burst. At this point you guys

01:37:16.107 --> 01:37:19.670
coast around one side, come round and you're now
going down to the center of the street where you

01:37:19.670 --> 01:37:24.875
previously hid and basically like muscled two of
them into a doorway after stabbing and killing

01:37:24.875 --> 01:37:31.908
them rapidly. You're now gliding through the
street along with the flow of the water, trying to

01:37:31.908 --> 01:37:37.919
keep above the surface. Caduceus being pushed
along by little Nott, going (thudding). At this

01:37:37.919 --> 01:37:47.765
point, from one of the nearby building tops, you
see two of these centurion yuan-ti see you guys

01:37:47.765 --> 01:37:55.128
pass beneath, begin giving out a call, and then
shouting over in their direction pointing towards

01:37:55.128 --> 01:38:03.649
you. Your presence is now aware to at least a
handful of nearby yuan-ti. Their weapons were

01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:07.464
either lost in the stream or not wielded of
course, but they're beginning to pull out their

01:38:07.464 --> 01:38:13.260
things. You guys continue to ride this forward,
you're leading the path, the way you can go. I

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:18.148
need everybody to make a general acrobatics check
to try and guide their body through the water in

01:38:18.148 --> 01:38:20.998
the direction that Caleb is shouting. This is a
group check.

01:38:20.998 --> 01:38:22.296
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:26.611
TRAVIS: Natural 20! Yasha rolled a five.

01:38:26.611 --> 01:38:29.820
MATT: Those count as double successes.

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:31.072
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:32.475
LIAM: Unnatural 20.

01:38:32.475 --> 01:38:33.515
MATT: Still good.

01:38:33.515 --> 01:38:37.148
SAM: 23, and Jester rolled a 23.

01:38:37.148 --> 01:38:40.468
MATT: You guys got this shit, like I don't even--
yeah, you're just out.

01:38:40.468 --> 01:38:46.326
SAM: Jester's been trying to make her way towards
him, if possible. Towards him, I don't know if she

01:38:46.326 --> 01:38:47.562
can get there.

01:38:47.562 --> 01:38:49.430
MATT: I think-- what did she roll?

01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:52.223
SAM: She rolled a 23. I mean she rolled a 19 plus
four.

01:38:52.223 --> 01:38:55.839
MATT: I'll say with that higher roll, she's been
able to make her way over towards the side of you

01:38:55.839 --> 01:38:57.624
guys, coasting along--

01:38:57.624 --> 01:39:00.219
TALIESIN: She doesn't actually have anything that
can wake me up right now.

01:39:00.219 --> 01:39:03.338
SAM: She does, she's trying to touch you so she
can cast Cure Wounds on you.

01:39:03.338 --> 01:39:07.104
TALIESIN: Oh my god, she has one left, doesn't
she? Holy shit, I forgot about that!

01:39:07.104 --> 01:39:11.453
MATT: All righty, so Jester just manages to just
make it over to the edge of you as the water,

01:39:11.453 --> 01:39:16.855
which was about maybe, with the flash flood about
three and a half, four feet deep, is now

01:39:16.855 --> 01:39:22.319
descending to about two foot. So some of you, your
feet manage to catch the floor beneath, but the

01:39:22.319 --> 01:39:25.689
water is still rushing rather fast, you can
continue to just go with the flow of it, or try

01:39:25.689 --> 01:39:31.036
and gather your footing, but it's up to you. You
can cast Cure Wounds on Caduceus.

01:39:31.036 --> 01:39:34.463
SAM: (as Jester) I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on
little man.

01:39:34.463 --> 01:39:35.640
MATT: A d4 plus--

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.344
TALIESIN: I'm not even little anymore.

01:39:37.344 --> 01:39:39.153
SAM: (as Jester) You're always little to me.

01:39:39.153 --> 01:39:41.394
TALIESIN: Oh! I'm up, I'm up, oh!

01:39:41.394 --> 01:39:46.511
MATT: So go to roll d4 plus your wisdom modifier.
Sorry, d8 for Cure Wounds.

01:39:46.511 --> 01:39:50.363
SAM: You're right. One point plus four is five.

01:39:50.363 --> 01:39:54.021
MATT: You're at five hit points, you come into
consciousness, on a sled over water.

01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:56.103
TALIESIN: Did I lose all my hit points when I went
unconscious?

01:39:56.103 --> 01:40:02.300
MATT: Yes, when you're drowning it brings you to
zero hit points.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:06.082
TALIESIN: Okay, I had zero then. Well, fuck.

01:40:06.082 --> 01:40:12.346
MATT: Riding the water eventually you guys manage
to keep it going. Are you going with the water, or

01:40:12.346 --> 01:40:13.570
are you fighting it?

01:40:13.570 --> 01:40:15.050
MARISHA: Might as well go with the flow.

01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:16.743
SAM: Is the water going the way we want to go?

01:40:16.743 --> 01:40:17.591
MATT: Mostly, yeah.

01:40:17.591 --> 01:40:20.669
LIAM: Yeah, I would be calling out this whole time
which ways we want to go to get out, <i>ja.</i>

01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:25.209
MATT: So you just continue with the flow of it,
the flow eventually comes to a stop on the outside

01:40:25.209 --> 01:40:29.160
of the city, maybe about 15 or 20 feet from the
treeline where you first entered.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.275
TRAVIS: Got to go.

01:40:30.275 --> 01:40:31.306
MARISHA: Keep moving.

01:40:31.306 --> 01:40:34.006
TRAVIS: Caduceus in the front, everyone behind
him.

01:40:34.006 --> 01:40:39.400
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- really quickly since
I have nothing else left, I'm going to cast

01:40:39.545 --> 01:40:44.332
Disguise Self and look like one of the lizard
people.

01:40:44.332 --> 01:40:45.373
MATT: Okay.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:47.903
TRAVIS: Yasha will be actually up front, just in
front of you.

01:40:47.903 --> 01:40:50.359
SAM: We need Caleb up front too, to guide us.

01:40:50.359 --> 01:40:53.219
MATT: As a note, all the makeup has been washed
off.

01:40:53.219 --> 01:40:55.027
TALIESIN: Oh, no!

01:40:55.027 --> 01:41:00.343
MATT: Sorry. As you guys are rushing towards the
treeline, you hear the shouting in the distance.

01:41:00.343 --> 01:41:03.204
You glance over, now that the water level has
stopped you can look behind, and you can see

01:41:03.204 --> 01:41:08.453
probably two dozen or so yuan-ti have now begun to
give chase. They're about a hundred feet behind

01:41:08.453 --> 01:41:13.670
you, but they saw you exit and they're on their
way giving chase. Now we're turning this into a

01:41:13.670 --> 01:41:19.473
skill challenge chase as you guys are making your
way through. As you guys are now charging into the

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:23.951
jungle, you're not doing stealth, so your speed
isn't as slow, which took you a day and a half or

01:41:23.951 --> 01:41:28.935
so to traverse this jungle to the center, unless
you want to keep stealthy, if it's charging through--

01:41:29.928 --> 01:41:30.475
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:41:30.475 --> 01:41:31.152
MARISHA: Run.

01:41:31.152 --> 01:41:32.746
TRAVIS: Loudest thing you ever heard.

01:41:32.746 --> 01:41:34.448
LIAM: Raiders of the Lost Ark, we're just cutting
through the jungle.

01:41:34.448 --> 01:41:37.153
MATT: Full speed, great. We have six rounds of
this challenge.

01:41:37.153 --> 01:41:38.373
MARISHA: Six rounds?

01:41:38.373 --> 01:41:42.774
MATT: Correct, success and failure do different
things. Who wants to offer something to help in

01:41:42.774 --> 01:41:48.803
this skill challenge? Much like the resurrection
challenge in this game, think of a creative way

01:41:48.803 --> 01:41:50.605
that you can help your progression.

01:41:50.605 --> 01:41:52.481
TRAVIS: Is it going to be dexterity checks?

01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:54.076
MATT: It depends on what you want to do.

01:41:54.076 --> 01:41:56.762
LIAM: Question, are we under 10 minutes since we
shot out the top of that pimple?

01:41:56.762 --> 01:41:58.428
MATT: You're still under 10 minutes, yes.

01:41:58.428 --> 01:42:03.383
LIAM: So I'm still sped up, and I'm going to run
at the front and just shout out directions and

01:42:03.383 --> 01:42:07.558
call out holes, things in the ground to look out
for. I'm going to lead the charge.

01:42:07.558 --> 01:42:12.437
MATT: Okay, I will say for that, make a survival
check with advantage.

01:42:12.437 --> 01:42:17.867
LIAM: Okay. Natural 20.

01:42:17.867 --> 01:42:26.599
MATT: That's one-- that's two successes on that
one! We'll add to that. So keeping a close eye,

01:42:26.787 --> 01:42:32.079
Caleb is darting ahead, into the jungle, shouting
out various issues. Jamedi is trying to keep up

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:36.131
with you but behind is also helping you keep an
eye and shouting out traps that he had helped you

01:42:36.131 --> 01:42:39.689
bypass before and making sure you guys don't fall
off the path that you had made your way through

01:42:39.689 --> 01:42:45.730
that he had set on his map beforehand that had
avoided the bigger dangers in the jungle. Between

01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:52.258
the two of you, you manage to get a fair bit in
there, and the sound of the chasing yuan-ti does

01:42:52.258 --> 01:42:55.786
not seem to be getting louder, which is good.
That's one, who does the next offer?

01:42:55.786 --> 01:42:59.655
TRAVIS: I was going to say Yasha can take out the
Magician's Judge and start cleaving machete-style

01:42:59.655 --> 01:43:04.412
through the brush, making it far easier for us to
move.

01:43:04.412 --> 01:43:07.460
MATT: Okay, Yasha going to push at the front,
which, with a higher speed than you, she can

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:13.632
definitely do, and begin to carve through swarths
of the jungle to make it an easier passage. For

01:43:13.632 --> 01:43:15.721
her, make an athletics check, please.

01:43:15.721 --> 01:43:17.139
TRAVIS: Advantage or straight up?

01:43:17.139 --> 01:43:19.277
MATT: Straight up, unless she's raging.

01:43:19.277 --> 01:43:21.901
TRAVIS: Oh, she's rage-clearing!

01:43:21.901 --> 01:43:24.379
MATT: Okay, I'll allow that for this.

01:43:24.379 --> 01:43:29.483
TRAVIS: 21-- 22.

01:43:29.483 --> 01:43:35.836
MATT: That's a success. Yasha's now ahead of the
group, she's carving through, you can see there

01:43:35.836 --> 01:43:40.634
are bits when you come up to the front, where
there is just dense clusters of tangled vines

01:43:40.634 --> 01:43:44.972
where the path you are taking-- Caleb stops you at
the front, because you deviated a little from the

01:43:44.972 --> 01:43:48.764
path where you were because you were running too
fast. At this point, you're not used to this level

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:54.718
of acceleration for an extended period of time.
Right at the end of your Expeditious Retreat,

01:43:54.718 --> 01:43:57.915
right as the spell is about to fade, you come to
that group of vines. At that point you're about to

01:43:57.915 --> 01:44:02.951
spin and warn everybody, and all you see is this
blur of Yasha carve through them. They all fall to

01:44:02.951 --> 01:44:08.392
the ground, the path before you is open, she goes
"Go!" All of you just keep running in that

01:44:08.392 --> 01:44:11.247
direction. Yasha's continuing that, who's taking
the next bit?

01:44:11.247 --> 01:44:19.670
TALIESIN: I'll use Thaumaturgy to create the sound
of a rushing group of us, but throw it--

01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:24.002
happening, I'm going to move us off into the
jungle in the other direction. "You can create

01:44:24.002 --> 01:44:27.512
"instantaneous sound that originates from a point
of your choice within range--" This is a rumble,

01:44:27.512 --> 01:44:29.709
within 30 feet, a rumble of thunder--

01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:33.286
MATT: Yeah, rumble of thunder you can do, it has
limitations to the sound you can make, but you can

01:44:33.286 --> 01:44:34.890
make a rumble of thunder.

01:44:34.890 --> 01:44:39.246
TALIESIN: I can't make it the cry of a raven--
"such as" is what it says.

01:44:39.246 --> 01:44:43.721
MATT: Oh, "such as--" I misunderstood what you're
saying. Yeah, there are certain sounds you can

01:44:43.721 --> 01:44:45.699
make, the sound of a whole group--

01:44:45.699 --> 01:44:48.229
TALIESIN: I'm making the sound of people rummaging
through--

01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:50.141
MATT: Okay, so rustling in the bushes, it makes
sense.

01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:52.866
TALIESIN: Yes, I'm pushing it away from us and
moving us in that direction.

01:44:52.866 --> 01:44:55.027
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:44:55.027 --> 01:44:58.787
TALIESIN: Come on, man, not some sucky stuff. Ah!
Not bad, 15.

01:44:58.787 --> 01:45:01.805
MATT: 15? That's just barely a success.

01:45:01.805 --> 01:45:04.633
TALIESIN: I'll take just barely today.

01:45:04.633 --> 01:45:16.466
MATT: All right, so with that, you hear the
chanting sounds, the war cry of yuan-ti behind

01:45:16.693 --> 01:45:23.198
you, and it begins to divert slightly, getting
them off track just a little bit. All right, who's

01:45:23.198 --> 01:45:25.252
taking the next bit? Who hasn't offered one?

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:27.187
TRAVIS: Oh there's six of these. I thought there
was three.

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.071
MATT: There's six stages of this.

01:45:29.071 --> 01:45:30.952
SAM: Everyone has to have an offer?

01:45:30.952 --> 01:45:33.213
MARISHA: Is there anyone tracking us pretty
closely yet?

01:45:33.213 --> 01:45:38.557
MATT: From what you can tell, not at the moment,
but if you wanted to use your turn to do something

01:45:38.557 --> 01:45:46.097
to see if somebody is. What do you want to do?
Your crit earlier gave a lower DC for the next

01:45:46.097 --> 01:45:49.031
check so that helped out tremendously.

01:45:49.031 --> 01:45:55.604
MARISHA: I'm going to take the rest of my ball
bearings and dump them out as we run.

01:45:55.604 --> 01:46:04.731
MATT: Okay. As a note, you're in a lush jungle--
Probably not going to do much on this, that's a

01:46:04.731 --> 01:46:09.224
hard, smooth floor type scenario. I mean, you can
if you want to.

01:46:09.224 --> 01:46:12.024
MARISHA: Nott, do you have anything you want to
offer?

01:46:12.024 --> 01:46:14.177
SAM: I have one thing, but--

01:46:14.177 --> 01:46:16.227
MARISHA: I don't know if any of my ideas are
good.

01:46:16.227 --> 01:46:19.919
SAM: We don't have eyes on the yuan-ti, do we?

01:46:19.919 --> 01:46:21.643
MATT: No, not at the moment.

01:46:21.643 --> 01:46:27.559
SAM: I would wait until they get closer before I
do my thing. Maybe Jester can--

01:46:27.559 --> 01:46:30.141
TRAVIS: There's two dozen of them. I don't want to
get that close.

01:46:30.141 --> 01:46:34.536
SAM: Well, I don't either, but if they do, I'd be
ready for something.

01:46:34.536 --> 01:46:39.180
TALIESIN: I have something else, but I'd be
curious if somebody else has something.

01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:45.820
MARISHA: I've got an oil flask. I could drop down
some fire but don't think it would work well either.

01:46:45.820 --> 01:47:03.377
SAM: Well sure, so I'll just yell to Beau: Beau!
Repeat after me, Fluffernutter! I'm going to throw

01:47:03.615 --> 01:47:05.664
the keg of gunpowder behind us.

01:47:05.664 --> 01:47:10.747
MARISHA: I go: Fluffernutter! and take my ninja
star and go (floof)!

01:47:10.747 --> 01:47:13.483
SAM: Wait, is it on fire? It has to be on fire!

01:47:13.483 --> 01:47:19.401
LIAM: I see it and use the Glove of Blasting to
fire three Scorching Rays.

01:47:19.401 --> 01:47:21.855
MARISHA: I don't have fire! I use my fists!

01:47:21.855 --> 01:47:24.187
LIAM: Three Scorching Rays.

01:47:24.187 --> 01:47:25.780
MATT: You have a second level spell to use?

01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:27.065
LIAM: No, the glove, I haven't used.

01:47:27.065 --> 01:47:29.378
MATT: The glove? Yeah you do! That's right, okay.

01:47:31.668 --> 01:47:35.357
MARISHA: I could have used the bottle rockets.

01:47:35.357 --> 01:47:42.622
MATT: Okay, this is a combined maneuver here. I'd
say for the success of this, this is going to be a

01:47:42.823 --> 01:47:46.716
combination of your-- make a roll with your ranged
spell attack--

01:47:46.716 --> 01:47:48.456
LIAM: Yeah, there's three rays.

01:47:48.456 --> 01:47:51.810
MATT: Yeah, you can go ahead and make a general
strength roll.

01:47:51.810 --> 01:48:01.265
SAM: General strength? That was my nickname in
high school. 15.

01:48:01.265 --> 01:48:08.336
MATT: Nice roll! Okay, you manage to lob it behind
with a fair amount of strength so it goes about

01:48:08.336 --> 01:48:10.209
ten, 15 feet behind you.

01:48:10.209 --> 01:48:15.881
SAM: Then if I can, I would push it with a little
Mage Hand, with a little extra top spin on it.

01:48:15.881 --> 01:48:23.172
MATT: Okay, it does a little whirl. It (whoof)
through the air and bounds a bit into the jungle

01:48:23.172 --> 01:48:24.540
behind you.

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.594
LIAM: How do I handle this? Is this a skill
check?

01:48:26.594 --> 01:48:29.955
MATT: Are you detonating it just 15, 20 feet
behind you? Or are you waiting for something else

01:48:29.955 --> 01:48:30.838
to come out?

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:32.890
LIAM: No, I'm just waiting for Nott to throwing it
back at them, yeah?

01:48:32.890 --> 01:48:35.374
MATT: Correct, but they're not visible yet though,
you don't know where you are.

01:48:35.374 --> 01:48:38.247
LIAM: Well I reacted to Fluffernutter being
shouted and seeing it--

01:48:38.247 --> 01:48:39.957
SAM: So blow it up! We'll make a wall of fire!

01:48:39.957 --> 01:48:42.194
LIAM: So I will track it and then hit it as it
struck the ground.

01:48:42.194 --> 01:48:43.522
MATT: Okay, what did you roll?

01:48:43.522 --> 01:48:47.440
LIAM: Well, I rolled three times, because there's
three rays. Do I use the spell modifier for this,

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.185
or not?

01:48:48.185 --> 01:48:49.061
MATT: You do.

01:48:49.061 --> 01:48:56.271
LIAM: Okay, so the highest roll was a 20, and then
the second highest was a 12, so probably of the

01:48:56.271 --> 01:48:57.965
three rays, probably only one--

01:48:57.965 --> 01:49:02.040
MATT: What was the second one? Sorry, 20 and 12
were the two highest?

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.748
LIAM: I rolled a 20, a 7 and a 12.

01:49:04.748 --> 01:49:09.091
MATT: Got you, okay. So the two hit, so roll
damage. The damage is going to be important here,

01:49:09.091 --> 01:49:15.950
because it is a waterlogged container of black
powder and may not be enough to truly ignite or

01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:18.906
cause an explosion here, or burn through the
barrel. We'll see.

01:49:18.906 --> 01:49:21.999
SAM: But the barrel you said was mostly intact?

01:49:21.999 --> 01:49:24.018
MATT: It's intact yeah, but it's wet.

01:49:24.018 --> 01:49:29.176
SAM: Yeah, but what about inside?

01:49:29.176 --> 01:49:31.984
MATT: It's soaked through a little bit.

01:49:31.984 --> 01:49:36.787
SAM: Barrels are waterproof, you keep beer in
them.

01:49:36.787 --> 01:49:38.899
MATT: This isn't a beer barrel.

01:49:38.899 --> 01:49:41.391
LIAM: Total of 12.

01:49:41.391 --> 01:49:50.691
MATT: That'll be enough. All right, so as it darts
behind, you watch the vision of Caleb spinning

01:49:50.691 --> 01:49:56.152
behind and releasing the glove in front with these
three arcs of flame. One of them hits a nearby

01:49:56.152 --> 01:50:00.966
bush and sets it aflame. The other two, one of
them hits the barrel and sends it arcing once

01:50:00.966 --> 01:50:07.616
more, and the second one hits; it detonates and
you guys feel this blast of hot wind behind you as

01:50:07.616 --> 01:50:12.697
your hair gets blown before your face. The entire
jungle around you lights for a moment with bright,

01:50:12.697 --> 01:50:19.845
yellow-white light, and there in that space now is
a couple of trees that have now set aflame, and a

01:50:19.845 --> 01:50:26.293
section of darkened crater on the ground where the
barrel was. The loud blast echoes across the

01:50:26.293 --> 01:50:28.017
jungle of the island around you.

01:50:28.017 --> 01:50:32.457
SAM: I just turn Beau around like, (shouting) That
was amazing! How did you do that with a throwing star?

01:50:32.745 --> 01:50:37.027
MARISHA: (shouting) I think these are magic
throwing stars! I think I bought magic throwing stars!

01:50:37.027 --> 01:50:44.165
MATT: I'll consider that a success. You guys keep
rushing. You assume, wherever the yuan-ti were,

01:50:44.165 --> 01:50:48.770
they're a little unsettled by this large explosion
in the direction of where they're travelling, and

01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:53.657
it slows them down a bit as they try and coast
around the area where the damage is. However,

01:50:53.657 --> 01:50:59.485
there seems to be a lizardmen hunting party now,
that is in the jungle a little ways ahead of you.

01:50:59.485 --> 01:51:00.428
MARISHA: What? Oh jeez.

01:51:00.428 --> 01:51:01.820
SAM: This thing won't stop!

01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:10.088
MATT: You guys have been running for the better
part of two hours now; it's a ways through this

01:51:10.088 --> 01:51:15.037
jungle to get back to the shore. So first and
foremost, I need everyone here to go ahead and

01:51:15.037 --> 01:51:18.118
make a constitution saving throw, please.

01:51:18.118 --> 01:51:21.001
TALIESIN: My favorite saving throw.

01:51:21.001 --> 01:51:27.486
TRAVIS: 23 for Fjord, 20 for Yasha.

01:51:27.486 --> 01:51:28.753
MATT: Good.

01:51:28.753 --> 01:51:29.749
MARISHA: 11.

01:51:29.749 --> 01:51:30.831
MATT: Okay.

01:51:30.831 --> 01:51:31.626
LIAM: One.

01:51:31.626 --> 01:51:34.171
MATT: You take a point of exhaustion there,
Caleb.

01:51:34.171 --> 01:51:35.221
SAM: Ten.

01:51:35.221 --> 01:51:37.427
MATT: Just barely succeeded.

01:51:37.427 --> 01:51:39.899
SAM: Jester rolled an eight.

01:51:39.899 --> 01:51:41.619
MATT: One point of exhaustion.

01:51:41.619 --> 01:51:43.075
SAM: Okay, conditions.

01:51:43.075 --> 01:51:44.173
TALIESIN: 18.

01:51:44.173 --> 01:51:46.755
MATT: All right, you're fine.

01:51:46.755 --> 01:51:48.558
TRAVIS: Jamedi?

01:51:48.558 --> 01:51:51.314
MATT: Avantika takes a point of exhaustion.

01:51:51.314 --> 01:51:52.678
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

01:51:52.678 --> 01:51:56.730
MATT: All right. You guys continue onward, since
you're just running through this jungle best you

01:51:56.730 --> 01:52:01.639
can, full sprint, it manages to keep ahead but
there is a threat of exhaustion as you continue to

01:52:01.639 --> 01:52:10.510
move. So, you now begin to hear the sound, this
familiar clacking (guttural noises) sound of the

01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:13.075
lizardmen that you saw in the jungle before. Who's
doing what?

01:52:13.075 --> 01:52:15.048
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's amazing.

01:52:15.048 --> 01:52:16.398
SAM: We're still doing this?

01:52:16.398 --> 01:52:20.686
MATT: You're still doing it. You had four total
successes in the round, you had one critical

01:52:20.686 --> 01:52:21.796
success which improved--

01:52:21.796 --> 01:52:23.468
SAM: We hear a hunting party? We see a hunting
party?

01:52:23.468 --> 01:52:25.882
MATT: You don't see them there, but you hear them
in the direction you are. Apparently the noise and

01:52:25.882 --> 01:52:29.742
the explosion caught the attention of a nearby
lizardmen hunting party.

01:52:29.742 --> 01:52:35.475
MARISHA: I have these bottle rockets, if you can
Mage Hand them away and distract them away from us

01:52:35.475 --> 01:52:37.818
with another popping sound.

01:52:37.818 --> 01:52:39.705
SAM: And set them off at the same--

01:52:39.705 --> 01:52:43.502
MARISHA: Well, I can light them, you throw, and
you take it further.

01:52:43.502 --> 01:52:44.708
SAM: Sure.

01:52:44.708 --> 01:52:45.901
MARISHA: Okay.

01:52:45.901 --> 01:52:48.290
SAM: Sure? Yes!

01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:49.428
MARISHA: We'll call it--

01:52:49.428 --> 01:52:50.429
SAM: Let's do it!

01:52:50.429 --> 01:52:51.899
TALIESIN: Certainly not the weirdest.

01:52:51.899 --> 01:52:54.842
MATT: So you're doing the exact same thing with a
different item. It's going to have a higher DC but

01:52:54.842 --> 01:52:56.643
you can do it. It's your call.

01:52:56.643 --> 01:52:58.326
MARISHA: Well gee, when you put it like that.

01:52:58.326 --> 01:53:04.689
MATT: I'm just saying, it's something you can do.
You want to do it?

01:53:04.689 --> 01:53:07.733
MARISHA: I don't know, I feel deeply shamed by my
suggestion now.

01:53:07.733 --> 01:53:11.942
MATT: No no, it's a great suggestion! I'm just
letting you know, progressively doing the same

01:53:11.942 --> 01:53:14.662
thing over and over again, it's going to continue
to raise the DC.

01:53:14.662 --> 01:53:22.931
SAM: You know, Jester hasn't done anything yet,
she still has a Thaumaturgy she could do. "You can

01:53:22.931 --> 01:53:29.222
"cause harmless tremors in the ground," but it
doesn't say where. Oh, "within 30 feet," yeah.

01:53:29.222 --> 01:53:30.693
That's no good.

01:53:30.693 --> 01:53:32.812
MATT: It's a cantrip. Cantrips don't have all that
power there.

01:53:32.812 --> 01:53:37.096
SAM: Yeah, they don't. Never mind, she uses it to
alter the appearance of her eyes for one minute.

01:53:37.096 --> 01:53:40.791
(laughter)

01:53:40.791 --> 01:53:42.195
SAM: She makes them black.

01:53:42.195 --> 01:53:44.323
MATT: There you go. Anybody else?

01:53:44.323 --> 01:53:49.648
TRAVIS: I can try to assume the form of one of the
lizard people in case they make eyes on us.

01:53:49.648 --> 01:53:50.734
MATT: Okay.

01:53:50.734 --> 01:53:52.350
TALIESIN: I've already done that as well.

01:53:52.350 --> 01:53:54.610
MATT: Two lizardfolk in the group now, all right.

01:53:54.610 --> 01:53:56.972
TRAVIS: I have no spell left to help.

01:53:56.972 --> 01:54:02.318
MATT: Doesn't have to be abilities, it can be just
whatever you think you would do in the area to help.

01:54:02.471 --> 01:54:04.678
MARISHA: I know, you just don't have a lot, you've
used all those things.

01:54:04.678 --> 01:54:08.288
SAM: I'm going to put up the cloak and just sneak.
We hear them?

01:54:08.288 --> 01:54:10.941
MATT: You heard the hunting call of them.

01:54:10.941 --> 01:54:12.871
SAM: In a direction that we can identify?

01:54:12.871 --> 01:54:16.950
MATT: Yes, somewhere in the front and to the right
of where you were as you guys were running through

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:17.815
the jungle.

01:54:17.815 --> 01:54:21.065
SAM: Okay, I'll just say, stay here, and I'm going
to put up the hood and I'm going to dodge off in

01:54:21.065 --> 01:54:22.612
that direction stealthily.

01:54:22.612 --> 01:54:24.362
MATT: Okay, are you guys stopping for Nott, then?

01:54:24.362 --> 01:54:25.550
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:26.822
MATT: Okay.

01:54:26.822 --> 01:54:28.452
SAM: Do I have to roll for stealth, I assume?

01:54:28.452 --> 01:54:30.760
MATT: Yes you do, with advantage because of your
cloak.

01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.805
SAM: Okay, so that's 22.

01:54:32.805 --> 01:54:36.671
MATT: Okay, so you are successfully stealthed,
this is not technically a success because this

01:54:36.671 --> 01:54:41.838
isn't actually helping the endeavor, but you do
manage to move ahead, and at your speed you come

01:54:41.838 --> 01:54:47.414
upon the hunting party. You can see now, there are
about six lizardmen with nets, shields, and spears

01:54:47.414 --> 01:54:51.969
that are currently making their way in the
direction of near where your party is currently

01:54:51.969 --> 01:54:56.433
waiting for you. The more time that passes, the
closer the yuan-ti get to your party.

01:54:56.433 --> 01:55:04.155
SAM: I'm going to cast Mage Hand. They're holding
nets and what else?

01:55:04.155 --> 01:55:09.952
MATT: Four of them have shields and spears, and
two of them have spears with nets, and the other

01:55:09.952 --> 01:55:15.046
ones have nets apparently tucked behind their
back. They're out here to catch and drag things back.

01:55:15.667 --> 01:55:24.252
SAM: Okay, Jesus, I got nothing, man. I'm just
going to try to Mage Hand and trip the guy in the

01:55:24.252 --> 01:55:28.154
back with his own net. Just pull it down a
little.

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:30.021
MATT: Okay, make an arcana check.

01:55:30.021 --> 01:55:31.407
SAM: Arcana check?

01:55:31.407 --> 01:55:36.786
MATT: Yes. This is to see if you can influence the
magical nature of your cantrip strong enough to

01:55:36.786 --> 01:55:38.519
try and trip up one of them.

01:55:38.519 --> 01:55:41.593
SAM: Okay, arcana check is a 20.

01:55:41.593 --> 01:55:47.383
MATT: Okay, that's barely a success because that's
not a very effective plan, necessarily.

01:55:47.383 --> 01:55:56.107
SAM: Sure. Didn't know what else to do, but okay.

01:55:56.107 --> 01:56:02.745
MATT: One of them gets tripped up in the net and
the other ones look back at it and start clacking

01:56:02.745 --> 01:56:07.046
at it and they're complaining about the one guy
that fell behind like an asshole and is slowing

01:56:07.046 --> 01:56:09.141
down their trajectory. Not a lot of distraction.
You can return, you figure you bought a little bit

01:56:09.141 --> 01:56:10.980
of time for your party but not much.

01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:11.863
SAM: Okay.

01:56:11.863 --> 01:56:12.830
MATT: Okay.

01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:19.183
SAM: I guess that's all I'll do. I don't know what
else to do! I-- You know what, I'm going to-- Fuck

01:56:19.183 --> 01:56:29.511
it! I'm going to cast Message and tell Caleb, go!
I'm going to go, hey fucktards, over here! and I'm

01:56:29.511 --> 01:56:31.253
going to just draw their attention.

01:56:31.253 --> 01:56:32.781
TRAVIS: Oh no.

01:56:32.781 --> 01:56:33.807
MATT: Okay.

01:56:33.807 --> 01:56:42.178
LIAM: I tell the group, she's doing something
stupid. She's distracting them, I have an idea but

01:56:42.178 --> 01:56:47.609
I don't want to leave her, let's go. I start
trudging through the jungle towards the direction

01:56:47.609 --> 01:56:48.567
I think is the right one.

01:56:48.567 --> 01:56:53.533
MATT: You all continue following Caleb. They are
now seemingly turning on you. (snarling)

01:56:53.533 --> 01:56:57.031
SAM: I'm going to bolt, double dash, fast as I can
go away.

01:56:57.031 --> 01:56:59.598
MATT: All right. You're darting through the
jungle--

01:56:59.598 --> 01:57:01.323
SAM: Not back towards my friends but like--

01:57:01.323 --> 01:57:02.725
MATT: Kind of in the adjacent direction.

01:57:02.725 --> 01:57:03.632
SAM: Perpendicular.

01:57:03.632 --> 01:57:05.970
MATT: Okay, no worries. They're giving chase,
they're following behind you, they know this

01:57:05.970 --> 01:57:12.577
jungle very well and can traverse it very easily.
However, you're quick, and you're small. For that,

01:57:12.577 --> 01:57:19.694
we'll say two of them throw ranged spears at you.
That's a 15 to hit?

01:57:19.694 --> 01:57:20.666
SAM: Nope.

01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:30.025
MATT: And a 12, nope. Both spears (impact) to the
nearby trees and you keep running trying to make

01:57:30.025 --> 01:57:32.600
it through. Eventually, you hear the sound of--

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:34.451
SAM: Drink run. Drink and run.

01:57:34.451 --> 01:57:38.045
MATT: Yeah, (gulping) as you're going. You hear
the footfalls breaking through of nearby brush and

01:57:38.045 --> 01:57:43.438
glance over, afraid to see yuan-ti and you can see
the shapes of your group, maybe 25 or 30 or so

01:57:43.438 --> 01:57:45.281
feet to your left.

01:57:45.281 --> 01:57:49.447
LIAM: Are we able to tell the direction-- where
the lizardmen are, in relation to Nott, or just

01:57:49.447 --> 01:57:51.097
yuan-ti on us?

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:54.110
MATT: Not at the moment, you guys are just
running. I mean, the lizardmen you knew were off

01:57:54.251 --> 01:57:57.451
to the front and right, and you guys darted at an
angle, and you're guiding them still in the

01:57:57.451 --> 01:57:58.537
direction toward the--

01:57:58.537 --> 01:58:02.384
LIAM: I'm saying, we all hear the yuan-ti or
<i>Nott</i> hears the yuan-ti coming?

01:58:02.384 --> 01:58:02.973
MATT: No.

01:58:02.973 --> 01:58:06.542
SAM: I saw you guys through the woods, but they're
behind me.

01:58:06.542 --> 01:58:09.714
MATT: Yeah, you haven't seen any of the yuan-ti,
you've gotten enough gain on them, but they've

01:58:09.714 --> 01:58:11.429
gotten a bit closer, but they haven't appeared
yet.

01:58:11.429 --> 01:58:16.469
LIAM: Okay, but I can tell the direction Nott is
running? Or moving?

01:58:16.469 --> 01:58:17.660
MATT: No, you're just--

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.157
LIAM: You've seen us, we haven't seen you.

01:58:19.157 --> 01:58:19.785
SAM: Yeah.

01:58:19.785 --> 01:58:20.518
MATT: Correct.

01:58:20.518 --> 01:58:21.227
LIAM: Never mind.

01:58:21.227 --> 01:58:24.565
MATT: You guys continue to run, continue to run,
continue to run-- Everyone, make another

01:58:24.565 --> 01:58:26.619
constitution saving throw please.

01:58:26.619 --> 01:58:31.866
TALIESIN: (groaning)

01:58:31.866 --> 01:58:34.086
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:58:34.086 --> 01:58:36.477
TRAVIS: 12 for Fjord, nine for Yasha.

01:58:36.477 --> 01:58:41.473
MATT: Yasha takes a point of exhaustion, Fjord
barely succeeds. DC goes up by two every time we

01:58:41.473 --> 01:58:42.112
do this.

01:58:42.112 --> 01:58:43.138
TALIESIN: Oh fuck, really?

01:58:43.138 --> 01:58:44.195
MARISHA: 20, total?

01:58:44.195 --> 01:58:47.925
MATT: 20? Success. Secondary point of exhaustion,
your speed is now halved.

01:58:47.925 --> 01:58:49.542
SAM: (whisper) Oh my god.

01:58:49.542 --> 01:58:54.123
MATT: Caleb is now winded, and now starting to
drag the group back a bit.

01:58:54.123 --> 01:58:58.745
SAM: One point of exhaustion, Jester succeeded, I
rolled a 14.

01:58:58.745 --> 01:59:02.268
TALIESIN: 16, she was 16. Ten.

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:04.257
MATT: Ten, point of exhaustion, Caduceus.

01:59:04.257 --> 01:59:05.537
TALIESIN: I, yeah.

01:59:05.537 --> 01:59:08.487
MATT: Anyone who has one point of exhaustion, your
ability checks are at disadvantage right now.

01:59:08.487 --> 01:59:09.300
SAM: Damn.

01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:11.448
MATT: Two points, your speed is halved.

01:59:11.448 --> 01:59:13.142
TRAVIS: I remember that well.

01:59:13.142 --> 01:59:19.628
TALIESIN: I have the ability to carry a large
amount because of my size, can I piggyback and not

01:59:19.628 --> 01:59:22.957
get too much of a roll if I throw Caleb on my
back?

01:59:22.957 --> 01:59:26.556
MATT: I will make this one of your checks.

01:59:26.556 --> 01:59:27.467
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:59:27.467 --> 01:59:29.149
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:30.062
TALIESIN: Oh man.

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:31.052
MATT: You have disadvantage because--

01:59:31.052 --> 01:59:32.839
TRAVIS: Or you could have Yasha do it.

01:59:32.839 --> 01:59:37.626
TALIESIN: I'll have Ya-- yeah, no, that's a better
idea, because I was-- five hit points, maybe not.

01:59:37.626 --> 01:59:40.625
MATT: Okay, so you share the idea with Yasha,
Yasha's going to attempt to--

01:59:40.625 --> 01:59:42.224
TRAVIS: Athletics?

01:59:42.224 --> 01:59:44.051
MATT: Does Yasha have a point of exhaustion?

01:59:44.051 --> 01:59:44.994
TRAVIS: She does.

01:59:44.994 --> 01:59:47.196
MATT: So disadvantage on her athletics check.

01:59:47.196 --> 01:59:48.385
MARISHA: I want to--

01:59:48.385 --> 01:59:50.176
TRAVIS: It's her biggest modifier.

01:59:50.176 --> 01:59:52.835
MATT: One second please, because this is going to
attribute to her--

01:59:52.835 --> 01:59:55.136
TRAVIS: Oh, a natural 20 and a 12, so that's 19.

01:59:55.136 --> 01:59:57.525
MATT: 19! That's a success.

01:59:57.525 --> 02:00:00.809
TALIESIN: (sigh of relief)

02:00:00.809 --> 02:00:03.265
MATT: That puts us at six total successes--

02:00:03.265 --> 02:00:04.940
TALIESIN: Oh my god--

02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:06.209
MARISHA: We're all clear?

02:00:06.209 --> 02:00:09.463
MATT: --across the checks here. Yasha throws Caleb
fireman-carry over the shoulder and you guys begin

02:00:09.463 --> 02:00:13.045
running and running and running. For this next
additional hour now, as you guys are charging

02:00:13.045 --> 02:00:16.473
through, following the path, we'll say you've gone
three or four hours of straight sprint through the

02:00:16.473 --> 02:00:22.620
forest. Sprint, stop, run. You're breathing heavy,
you're sweating profusely, your body is aching,

02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:30.217
your mouth is just filled with the worst
cottonmouth, you're dehydrated. You can hear the

02:00:30.217 --> 02:00:37.494
yelping of approaching lizardmen and yuan-ti as
you see the light begin to slowly break ahead of

02:00:37.494 --> 02:00:42.821
you, through the trees as the treeline begins to
thin, and the faintest bit of blue is visible.

02:00:42.821 --> 02:00:47.730
Within a few more moments, you break through the
treeline and you've found yourself back to the

02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:57.066
white sand beaches of Urukaxl. There, as you come
out to the sand, the hot reflection of the sun

02:00:57.066 --> 02:01:02.514
against the light. You can see now the sun is
close to setting at this point, the sky itself has

02:01:02.514 --> 02:01:07.716
gotten slowly darker as you've moved past. The
white beaches have now come to a faint dull yellow

02:01:07.716 --> 02:01:14.774
and orange with the coming sunset light. Nott
emerges from the nearby brush.

02:01:14.774 --> 02:01:16.120
SAM: (panting)

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:17.620
MATT: She's catching up with the rest of you
guys.

02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:18.777
SAM: (panting) I'm exhausted.

02:01:18.777 --> 02:01:21.426
TRAVIS: On the ship! On the ship!

02:01:21.426 --> 02:01:23.185
SAM: They're right behind me!

02:01:23.185 --> 02:01:28.324
MATT: You guys look and there are the two rowboats
that are still right where you left them.

02:01:28.324 --> 02:01:32.278
LIAM: Yasha's moving towards the beach, Caleb's
going to just start firing Firebolt after Firebolt

02:01:32.278 --> 02:01:36.923
at the treeline, I've a 120 foot range, and is
going to set the jungle on fire behind us.

02:01:36.923 --> 02:01:44.983
MATT: Okay-- I will say, roll an arcana check for
me.

02:01:44.983 --> 02:01:47.721
LIAM: Natural one.

02:01:47.721 --> 02:01:55.733
MATT: Unfortunately, as a cantrip, the perpetual
fiery quality of it, it can do bursts of damage

02:01:55.733 --> 02:02:01.750
and plops of flame but unfortunately, the treeline
here is too humid, the air here is too wet and

02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:08.395
none of the trees are catching. However, you
manage to get over, Yasha throws you onto one of

02:02:08.395 --> 02:02:12.459
the two rowboats, you guys get on, too. At this
point, you can now see, breaching one side of the

02:02:12.459 --> 02:02:17.827
treeline, the yuan-ti, the other side, a group of
lizardmen. They come to a head and look at each

02:02:17.827 --> 02:02:22.376
other and look at you. Half of each group charges
at each other--

02:02:22.376 --> 02:02:23.255
SAM: Oh yes!

02:02:23.255 --> 02:02:25.381
MATT: --while the other half begins to charge
towards the rowboats.

02:02:25.381 --> 02:02:26.677
TRAVIS: (groaning) Oh fuck.

02:02:26.677 --> 02:02:27.610
MARISHA: At the rowboat?

02:02:27.610 --> 02:02:29.541
SAM: Start the motor, start the motor!

02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:30.571
SAM: (ripcord noises)

02:02:30.571 --> 02:02:32.405
MARISHA: How close are they?

02:02:32.405 --> 02:02:35.286
MATT: They're about 40 feet away, it's a 40 foot
rush.

02:02:35.286 --> 02:02:38.666
MATT: They're going to catch up-- You guys push
off and you're rowing out, you're about ten now,

02:02:38.666 --> 02:02:42.826
15 or 20 feet off the edge, they catch up, they
start getting their shortbows ready. At this

02:02:42.826 --> 02:02:45.994
point, you hear (cannon fire)

02:02:46.565 --> 02:02:47.397
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:02:47.397 --> 02:02:48.341
TALIESIN: Oh thank god--

02:02:48.341 --> 02:02:49.147
TRAVIS: Volley that shit.

02:02:49.147 --> 02:02:52.833
MATT: (cannon fire) Bursts of sand, columns of
sand go flying into the air, and you watch as one

02:02:52.833 --> 02:02:57.786
lizardman (scream), a yuan-ti bursts off to the
side. You look over, you can see the flashes of

02:02:57.786 --> 02:03:00.867
light on the sides of the Squalleater--

02:03:00.867 --> 02:03:02.465
TRAVIS: Oh, so sick!

02:03:02.465 --> 02:03:04.397
MATT: --as volley after
volley of cannon fire is blown towards the edge of

02:03:04.397 --> 02:03:11.004
the shoreline. A couple close calls, as it's not a
perfect aiming implement. You see as-- you dodge

02:03:11.004 --> 02:03:15.038
out of the way as (splashing) big burst of water.
Some of the yuan-ti dive into the water and are

02:03:15.038 --> 02:03:19.170
now swimming through, trying to come back-- you
can see their serpentine bodies making their way

02:03:19.170 --> 02:03:20.405
in your direction.

02:03:20.405 --> 02:03:22.361
TRAVIS: Caleb and I are picking them off, Eldritch
Blast and--

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:23.049
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:03:23.049 --> 02:03:25.007
MATT: Hitting in the water as you do.

02:03:25.007 --> 02:03:28.452
MARISHA: I'm on the edge, doing polearm duty, like
croc hunting.

02:03:28.452 --> 02:03:29.581
TRAVIS: No! No!

02:03:29.581 --> 02:03:30.922
MARISHA: (grunting)

02:03:30.922 --> 02:03:31.923
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just--

02:03:31.923 --> 02:03:35.872
MATT: Eventually, you guys get far enough away
from the edge, it becomes less advantageous for

02:03:35.872 --> 02:03:41.222
them to focus on you and than to focus each other.
Through the cacophony of explosions and the rest

02:03:41.222 --> 02:03:47.073
are wrestling the much larger force of both the
lizardpeople that live on this island and the

02:03:47.073 --> 02:03:51.610
yuan-ti that have given chase are now focused on
each other and this conflict is now spilling back

02:03:51.610 --> 02:03:59.907
into the jungle and away from the beach. As you
all, very sore, make your way towards the

02:03:59.907 --> 02:04:05.596
Squalleater, and now you can see, offshore, The
Mist, or The Mistake, has also been pulled off the

02:04:05.596 --> 02:04:11.611
shore, seemingly repaired enough to be at least
semi-serviceable, though it's only been a day or

02:04:11.611 --> 02:04:18.624
so and the repairs probably aren't long-haul
permanent, but for the first time, in a very, very

02:04:18.624 --> 02:04:27.722
long time this day, you all take a deep breath,
some of you taking a short nap, as you row

02:04:27.722 --> 02:04:36.971
yourself to the sunset over the distant far shores
of the ocean, towards the ships that mean safety--

02:04:36.971 --> 02:04:38.215
and that's where we're going to take a break.

02:04:38.215 --> 02:04:39.388
(groaning)

02:04:39.388 --> 02:04:40.171
SAM: Oh my god.

02:04:40.171 --> 02:04:43.535
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Why did we not take a short
rest right when we started! (laughter)

02:04:44.287 --> 02:04:45.953
SAM: You're the one who-- it's your thing!

02:04:45.953 --> 02:04:47.271
TRAVIS: I know, I know!

02:04:47.271 --> 02:04:49.705
I didn't think about it, damn it!

02:04:49.705 --> 02:04:51.567
MARISHA: Yeah. Not feeling that whole time.

02:04:51.567 --> 02:04:52.738
TRAVIS: That was gnarly!

02:04:53.323 --> 02:04:57.471
TRAVIS: Dude, you're good, you're good, you're
good. Water is your friend, you're good.

02:04:57.471 --> 02:04:59.609
TALIESIN: This is, yeah. That was a lot.

02:04:59.609 --> 02:05:02.526
(laughter)

02:05:02.526 --> 02:05:04.724
MATT: Okay then, <i>damn</i>!

02:05:04.724 --> 02:05:06.730
MARISHA: I've never felt more <i>useless</i>.

02:05:06.730 --> 02:05:08.389
TRAVIS: Oh fuck me.

02:05:08.389 --> 02:05:09.712
SAM: Magical prime time.

02:05:09.712 --> 02:05:10.935
TRAVIS: That was a teacher.

02:05:10.935 --> 02:05:11.732
MARISHA: Curse you!

02:05:11.732 --> 02:05:12.694
TRAVIS: That was a teacher.

02:05:12.694 --> 02:05:14.361
SAM: Do we really only have mutterfingers--

02:05:14.361 --> 02:05:16.818
TALIESIN: It's only a teacher if we actually learn
from these mistakes--

02:05:16.818 --> 02:05:18.382
SAM: --blob boffers, and words?

02:05:18.392 --> 02:05:20.281
TRAVIS: No, there's also smudge and--

02:05:20.281 --> 02:05:22.870
TALIESIN: I have a giant pile of stuff in the
other room

02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:25.141
SAM: I want Meese's Meanutmutter Mubs!

02:05:25.141 --> 02:05:27.121
(laughter)

02:05:27.284 --> 02:05:29.309
LIAM: It's all they had at Smogschmeade!

02:05:29.309 --> 02:05:31.385
SAM: I don't even know what that means.

02:05:31.385 --> 02:05:36.200
MATT: I don't either. Anyway! Friends, we're going
to go to our break here in just a moment, we'll

02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:40.684
return but in the meantime, we have another
Wyrmwood giveaway. This fantastic, delightful

02:05:40.684 --> 02:05:45.260
padauk dice vault, which is magnetized, opens up
to keep all your dice, possibly even a couple

02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:50.294
miniatures in there, well-kept, beautiful orange
color for the Halloween season that we're still

02:05:50.294 --> 02:05:51.934
celebrating today, damn it!

02:05:51.934 --> 02:05:53.212
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:56.418
MATT: So, to enter this, you need to jump over to
the Critical Role Twitch chat, that's

02:05:56.418 --> 02:06:04.122
twitch.tv/criticalrole, and enter the keyword
once. The keyword is, hydra. H-Y-D-R-A. We'll come

02:06:04.122 --> 02:06:07.125
back at the break for a winner, once again, only
people in the United States and Canada, excluding

02:06:07.125 --> 02:06:12.541
Quebec, can enter, we're working on it. But. We'll
come back with a winner here in just a moment so

02:06:12.541 --> 02:06:14.455
sit tight, be right back.

02:06:14.455 --> 02:06:16.910
(cheering and groaning)

02:06:16.910 --> 02:24:32.875
[break]

02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:35.718
MATT: And welcome back everybody--

02:24:35.718 --> 02:24:38.109
(singing)

02:24:38.109 --> 02:24:46.221
MATT: (laughter) So. We have a winner of the
fantastic padauk dice vault, I believe that's how

02:24:46.221 --> 02:24:52.535
it's pronounced, or not. I might be messing it up.
But. Regardless, the winner is fmiller8. fmiller8,

02:24:52.535 --> 02:24:53.581
congratulations--

02:24:53.581 --> 02:24:54.869
TRAVIS: fmiller8, yeah, man!

02:24:54.869 --> 02:24:57.423
MATT: We'll get this vault sent out to you ASAP.

02:24:57.423 --> 02:25:00.197
(cheering)

02:25:00.197 --> 02:25:00.981
MATT: All right.

02:25:00.981 --> 02:25:02.430
TALIESIN: Can we ever not look?

02:25:02.430 --> 02:25:05.005
TRAVIS: Can we just automatically get a short
rest, just because that was the most--

02:25:05.005 --> 02:25:06.847
MARISHA: Yeah, do we just collapse--

02:25:06.847 --> 02:25:08.140
TRAVIS: heinous, strenuous--

02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:09.978
MARISHA: of exhaustion as soon as we hit the
deck?

02:25:09.978 --> 02:25:10.751
MATT: Nope.

02:25:10.751 --> 02:25:11.619
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

02:25:11.619 --> 02:25:16.163
MATT: Because you're rowing to the ship and
there's still the occasional (cannon fire) of the

02:25:16.163 --> 02:25:24.629
final shots sent off to deflect any interest in
following or pursuing you towards the boats. As

02:25:24.629 --> 02:25:28.857
you guys are trying to make some distance here,
you look over at Avantika, who has her one

02:25:28.857 --> 02:25:34.424
ungloved hand, you can see the gap where the open
wound, there's just a little bit of blood

02:25:34.424 --> 02:25:41.870
trickling down her forearm where the eye once was.
She looks at it, closes her fist, closes her eyes,

02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:49.701
and you feel the rowboat suddenly pick up speed,
and you watch as the water and the waves now give

02:25:49.701 --> 02:25:55.018
an additional thrust like the ocean itself is
rising and pushing the boat forward and you watch

02:25:55.018 --> 02:26:01.661
Avantika open her eyes and smile and looks over at
Fjord and goes, "Well, better luck next time,

02:26:01.661 --> 02:26:09.763
huh?" The boat is now speedboating across the
surface of the water, the other rowboat left

02:26:09.763 --> 02:26:12.004
behind in its wake.

02:26:12.004 --> 02:26:14.633
LIAM: One die roll, man. One die roll.

02:26:14.633 --> 02:26:16.700
MATT: One die roll.

02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:20.339
LIAM: (high-pitched) I said bi--

02:26:20.339 --> 02:26:27.272
MATT: (laughter) As you approach the outskirts of
the Squalleater. The rope ladders are thrown over

02:26:27.272 --> 02:26:33.381
the edge, down into the water. With that, you all
eventually climb up onto the top as some of the

02:26:33.381 --> 02:26:39.739
crew goes over to retrieve and ratchet up and
bring the rowboats back onto the ship. Now you all

02:26:39.739 --> 02:26:47.463
clamber onto the deck of the large ship and take a
moment of respite and breather as your-- the crew

02:26:47.463 --> 02:26:55.193
of the Squalleater there awaits. You can see there
Bouldergut, the large ogre chief, stands there, arms

02:26:55.193 --> 02:27:05.080
crossed, with the stretched leather tunic now
strapped on each side of her torso. Avantika rises and

02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:15.819
Vera waits, her right-hand, soothsayer-like
assistant, or for this, would be considered the

02:27:15.819 --> 02:27:21.366
deckhand and spiritual leader of this ship.

02:27:21.366 --> 02:27:23.567
SAM: Can I pause you for one second, Matt?

02:27:23.745 --> 02:27:24.547
MATT: Yes, you may.

02:27:24.547 --> 02:27:27.485
SAM: Did you all fucking take off your costumes?

02:27:27.485 --> 02:27:29.412
MARISHA: Yeah...

02:27:29.412 --> 02:27:30.628
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:27:30.628 --> 02:27:32.429
TRAVIS: No, we're still wearing ours. Are--

02:27:32.429 --> 02:27:34.416
LIAM: Is that super-glued on or something?

02:27:34.416 --> 02:27:35.185
SAM: No!

02:27:35.185 --> 02:27:36.539
MATT: I took mine off.

02:27:36.539 --> 02:27:37.742
SAM: That I saw.

02:27:37.742 --> 02:27:41.589
(laughter)

02:27:41.589 --> 02:27:42.873
MARISHA: It got uncomfortable--

02:27:42.873 --> 02:27:43.865
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

02:27:43.865 --> 02:27:44.995
TRAVIS: It was bad luck.

02:27:44.995 --> 02:27:47.434
MARISHA: You have clothes underneath your--
fiber!

02:27:47.434 --> 02:27:49.243
SAM: Do I?

02:27:49.243 --> 02:27:53.872
MATT: (laughter) That's true, if there was any of
us I would not be able to truly--

02:27:53.872 --> 02:27:55.353
TRAVIS: Uh huh.

02:27:55.353 --> 02:27:56.722
MATT: be certain--

02:27:56.722 --> 02:27:58.534
TRAVIS: There are imprints being left on that
chair.

02:27:58.534 --> 02:27:59.348
MATT: Yeah.

02:27:59.348 --> 02:28:01.690
(laughter)

02:28:01.690 --> 02:28:05.687
SAM: Sticky butt. Peel off, peel off.

02:28:05.687 --> 02:28:06.977
MARISHA: Little hearts!

02:28:06.977 --> 02:28:09.275
SAM: Sorry, Matt.

02:28:09.275 --> 02:28:18.894
MATT: It's okay. So, as you all bring yourselves
onto the ship here, Vera approaches Avantika and

02:28:18.894 --> 02:28:31.852
helps her to her feet and says like "So, how did
it go? Tell us." Avantika shows her hand, "Twas a

02:28:31.852 --> 02:28:40.274
"resounding success. I would say that our new
compatriots have proven their worth with flying

02:28:40.274 --> 02:28:45.136
"colors." She goes and gives a (clapping) ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow--

02:28:45.136 --> 02:28:50.106
(laughter)

02:28:50.106 --> 02:28:56.654
MATT: "And I do believe," You see Jamedi sitting
on the ground, and goes, "Yes?" "You have earned

02:28:56.654 --> 02:29:04.980
"what our contract assured you. Please, Vera, if
you could retrieve the payment." Vera leaves and

02:29:04.980 --> 02:29:09.871
in a moment, comes back with a small chest and
hands it over to Jamedi, who sets it into his

02:29:09.871 --> 02:29:20.541
pouch and satchel. He stands up for a second, nods
his head, "I hope you understand, that with all

02:29:20.541 --> 02:29:27.255
"due respect, this is our <i>last</i> time working
together." The Captain says, "Aye, I understand,

02:29:27.255 --> 02:29:33.292
"but it is your loss. There is always more work for
you. Where would you like to be dropped off?"

02:29:33.292 --> 02:29:35.577
SAM: In a graveyard.

02:29:35.577 --> 02:29:48.029
MATT: At this point Vera says, "Captain, at this
moment, it appears that we have maybe 11 days of

02:29:48.267 --> 02:29:55.716
"supplies, given that our crew has now swelled. As
such, we could probably make it back to Darktow to

02:29:55.716 --> 02:30:03.582
"also complete the repairs on The Mist, as it is
seaworthy, but I do not know how long. So that

02:30:03.582 --> 02:30:10.539
"would be my recommendation. Maybe making a stop or
two along the way, whatever's close by." The

02:30:10.539 --> 02:30:19.620
"captain considers. "Very well, I guess we'll make
our way westward onto Darktow to get repairs done,

02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:30.848
"to supply up, and should you wish to stay, make
our way to the next leg of our journey. Who knows?

02:30:30.848 --> 02:30:37.939
"It seems that you are up for your own rewards to
be reaped, eh?"

02:30:37.939 --> 02:30:48.234
TRAVIS: Indeed. Such a mighty display on the way
back, I feel like I would be left wanting if I

02:30:48.234 --> 02:30:51.124
didn't try and pursue the same sort of glory.

02:30:51.124 --> 02:31:02.102
MATT: "Of course. Well, these gifts are paltry.
Once Uk'otoa is truly free, then the true blessing

02:31:02.102 --> 02:31:03.555
"can be given."

02:31:03.555 --> 02:31:11.191
TRAVIS: Captain, may I ask, you knew of this
location already. Do you have a lead on another?

02:31:11.191 --> 02:31:17.324
MATT: "I have a lead on someone that should be in
Darktow that would be able to-- with the right

02:31:17.324 --> 02:31:25.925
"amount of coin-- give us the information we seek.
Hopefully. If not, we'll be sitting here with our

02:31:25.925 --> 02:31:31.641
"thumbs up our asses, but I've paid well enough,
and this person has come through before, so

02:31:31.641 --> 02:31:33.145
"fingers crossed, eh?"

02:31:33.145 --> 02:31:34.444
TRAVIS: Indeed.

02:31:34.444 --> 02:31:41.020
MATT: "Regardless, I think we could all use a bit
of rest, eh?" Looks over to Caduceus.

02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:46.733
TALIESIN: I would be amenable at this point.

02:31:46.733 --> 02:31:54.348
MATT: "Understood. Get Jeremiah to get food
cooking immediately. I think a fine meal and a

02:31:54.547 --> 02:32:06.553
full night's rest is in order. Friends, I'm
impressed, and I'm thankful that you've not only

02:32:06.553 --> 02:32:15.074
upheld your side of the bargain, you proved
yourselves as quite formidable mercenaries. I mean

02:32:15.074 --> 02:32:22.860
no disrespect to some of my crew, but when we get
back to Darktow--" She looks at some of the crew.

02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:30.106
"Turn around." Some of them-- "Maybe we'll deal
with some trade off, eh? Send some of them over to

02:32:30.106 --> 02:32:33.141
The Mist and maybe you'll stay with me for a
while."

02:32:33.141 --> 02:32:42.360
TRAVIS: We would certainly entertain that very
notion. It's hard to think past any sort of a rest.

02:32:42.369 --> 02:32:48.131
MARISHA: Sorry, I thought that was hypothetical
and that we were-- talk about that later, which we

02:32:48.131 --> 02:32:49.785
should do.

02:32:49.785 --> 02:32:57.906
MATT: "Very well. Then we will get some sleep and
on the morrow we will discuss how much money we

02:32:57.906 --> 02:33:04.931
can make together. We'll probably make a stop or
two along the way, if you're interested. Bring up

02:33:04.931 --> 02:33:10.552
the map and see what you want to do. When we've
had a bit of rest, maybe a glass of wine."

02:33:10.552 --> 02:33:12.328
TRAVIS: Of course.

02:33:12.328 --> 02:33:23.539
MATT: "All right. Go, rest, sleep. I shall do the
same." She walks back into her quarters, Vera

02:33:23.539 --> 02:33:30.151
staying there on the deck. Jamedi makes his way
down to his quarters. What would you like to do?

02:33:30.151 --> 02:33:32.623
SAM: Go to our quarters, I guess?

02:33:32.623 --> 02:33:41.875
TRAVIS: Could we have a conversation near the bow
of the ship, perhaps? Away from ears? Is it empty

02:33:41.875 --> 02:33:43.638
towards the bow?

02:33:43.638 --> 02:33:47.609
MATT: You can find a bit that seems a little more
remote, but there are deckhands; there are folks

02:33:47.609 --> 02:33:50.017
that are always keeping watch.

02:33:50.017 --> 02:33:55.454
MARISHA: I'll be right back. You guys find a spot,
I'll meet you there. I go back and I go,

02:33:55.454 --> 02:34:01.375
Jeremiah! Give me that. I take bread or whatever
he has prepared.

02:34:01.375 --> 02:34:08.556
MATT: You come to Jeremiah. You eventually start
shouting until you find Jeremiah. Jeremiah is this

02:34:08.556 --> 02:34:21.045
mid-40s halfling fellow. Pale, but well-dressed in
colorful silks and vibrant makeup. From some of

02:34:21.045 --> 02:34:26.040
the theater productions you've seen, he seems
almost made up for the stage, but just a cook. Big

02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:32.955
smile, big curled, waxed mustache, hair parted and
curled on the sides, light brown, auburn hair.

02:34:32.955 --> 02:34:40.721
Portly halfling fellow, and as you're shouting his
name, he goes, "Hello? Are you looking for me?"

02:34:40.721 --> 02:34:42.563
MARISHA: Yep, Jeremiah.

02:34:42.563 --> 02:34:44.924
MATT: "I'm Jeremiah. What's your name?"

02:34:44.924 --> 02:34:46.246
MARISHA: Hi. Beau.

02:34:46.246 --> 02:34:53.044
MATT: "Beau, yes. You're one of the new kids. I am
making food. Would you--?"

02:34:53.044 --> 02:34:57.793
MARISHA: What do you have right now? Something
ready? I want to chew on something while we talk.

02:34:57.793 --> 02:35:00.656
MATT: "Fine, here you go." He hands over a
somewhat stale loaf.

02:35:00.656 --> 02:35:03.255
MARISHA: Thank you. You have sausage to go with
that?

02:35:03.255 --> 02:35:07.544
MATT: "No, they are being prepared, and I wish not
to serve something that is unfinished."

02:35:07.544 --> 02:35:10.030
MARISHA: Water. Wine.

02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:17.933
MATT: (sighs) Grabs a thing of wine, a small jar,
and says, "You can fetch your own water."

02:35:17.933 --> 02:35:21.154
MARISHA: Thank you, sorry, I'm just hungry as
fuck. I go back to the group.

02:35:21.154 --> 02:35:28.222
MATT: All right. You guys patiently wait for Beau
to return with a stale--

02:35:28.222 --> 02:35:30.470
MARISHA: I got appetizers. There you go.

02:35:30.470 --> 02:35:33.895
SAM: Okay, that's good. (gnawing)

02:35:33.895 --> 02:35:41.720
TRAVIS: I should start by thanking all of you for
putting yourselves in harm's way again. I did not

02:35:42.117 --> 02:35:47.165
expect that to go the way that it did, but that
seems a repetitive notion at this point.

02:35:47.165 --> 02:35:51.059
MARISHA: What the fuck actually happened down
there? We haven't really gotten a clear

02:35:51.059 --> 02:35:54.439
description, and we're all confused.

02:35:54.439 --> 02:36:01.604
TRAVIS: Yeah. I knew when she showed that
exuberance at diving down that it was a matter of

02:36:01.604 --> 02:36:08.371
urgency, and I just couldn't catch her. We made
our way down this well into this open, spherical

02:36:08.371 --> 02:36:14.004
room. At the bottom underneath some algae, there
was a recession. It looked like it had space for

02:36:14.004 --> 02:36:23.585
an orb, like the eye that's in my sword. In my
dullardly moment of trying to figure how the fuck

02:36:23.585 --> 02:36:30.438
I would get it in there, she reached out, and she
has the same sort of thing in her hand. She put it

02:36:30.438 --> 02:36:39.567
in before I could put the sword in. It ripped the
eye straight out of her hand. Pulled her hand back

02:36:39.567 --> 02:36:46.727
and blood was coming out of it; I thought it had
done something to her. That's when I saw these

02:36:46.727 --> 02:36:52.504
arcane-like symbols light up and they shoot across
the floor and straight up toward you guys right

02:36:52.504 --> 02:36:53.422
above the water.

02:36:53.422 --> 02:36:55.066
MARISHA: Yeah, we saw them.

02:36:55.066 --> 02:36:58.545
TRAVIS: You saw them come out? What happened?

02:36:58.545 --> 02:37:02.078
MARISHA: It connected to the pillars and then
that's when everything started flooding. Then it

02:37:02.078 --> 02:37:05.364
was just running for our lives at that point. I
don't know. I didn't see much else.

02:37:05.364 --> 02:37:12.678
LIAM: It was in a hurry, but the type of runes
that were in that chamber were one of protection,

02:37:12.678 --> 02:37:20.076
some sort of ward that I don't understand. It's
old. It shook the entire room we were in. I

02:37:20.076 --> 02:37:26.409
thought maybe there were three locks down there,
but you only saw one. Presumably, there are two

02:37:26.409 --> 02:37:30.891
more places in the ocean or in the world for you.

02:37:30.891 --> 02:37:34.032
TRAVIS: That seems like a lot.

02:37:34.032 --> 02:37:38.985
TALIESIN: There's more than one. There was more
than one creature.

02:37:38.985 --> 02:37:47.481
MARISHA: There's also the temple where we found
this thing that had the snake, the naga.

02:37:47.481 --> 02:37:54.663
TRAVIS: But no recession. I can't remember, when
we found the actual cat's eye, the sphere, it

02:37:54.663 --> 02:37:57.608
wasn't in a recession. Was it just resting at the
bottom of the well?

02:37:57.608 --> 02:38:00.873
MATT: It was just sitting in a pool of water, and
you found that amongst other piles. It seemed to

02:38:00.873 --> 02:38:09.406
be less of a temple and more of a scavenged
artifact amongst a merrow den that was expanding

02:38:09.406 --> 02:38:10.769
beneath the swamp.

02:38:10.769 --> 02:38:14.876
TALIESIN: We need three onyx eyes, three ivory
eyes, three amber eyes.

02:38:14.876 --> 02:38:17.178
TRAVIS: From three different creatures.

02:38:17.178 --> 02:38:19.970
MARISHA: What was the one that was inside of you?
Is it the onyx one?

02:38:19.970 --> 02:38:21.404
TRAVIS: No, it was the amber one.

02:38:21.404 --> 02:38:23.583
MARISHA: It was the amber one. Oh shit!

02:38:23.583 --> 02:38:26.708
TRAVIS: Yeah. That big serpent with all the eyes
like in her captain's--

02:38:26.708 --> 02:38:29.114
SAM: What was Avantika's?

02:38:29.114 --> 02:38:30.412
TRAVIS: Amber, yeah.

02:38:30.412 --> 02:38:32.140
MARISHA: Is it the same color?

02:38:32.140 --> 02:38:37.510
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, they're yellowish-amber.
Yellowish-orange. Just depends on the way the

02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:38.952
light hits it.

02:38:38.952 --> 02:38:44.214
MARISHA: So in the amber, it was the giant serpent
with the tidal wave.

02:38:44.214 --> 02:38:56.854
TRAVIS: Yeah, the same that she had decorated
around her office. That's Uk'otoa. You saw when we

02:38:56.854 --> 02:39:01.633
were in the boat, she closed her hands and you
felt that surge in the water?

02:39:01.633 --> 02:39:02.858
LIAM: Yeah.

02:39:02.858 --> 02:39:10.469
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think because she got there first
and offered her orb, she was rewarded with some

02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:15.019
sort of oceanic control or power over water.

02:39:15.019 --> 02:39:17.468
SAM: She controlled the water?

02:39:17.468 --> 02:39:19.219
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:39:19.219 --> 02:39:21.914
SAM: She's the one who made the flood?

02:39:21.914 --> 02:39:26.159
TRAVIS: No, back when we were in the rowboats.

02:39:26.159 --> 02:39:33.793
SAM: Oh, when we took off. I was curled up in the
bottom of the well of the rowboat, cowering, so I

02:39:33.793 --> 02:39:39.891
didn't see any of that. She got something for
giving up her--?

02:39:39.891 --> 02:39:44.693
TRAVIS: I think so, yeah. I don't know why the
water surged out of the temple like that.

02:39:44.693 --> 02:39:53.664
SAM: We also heard a large cracking sound as if a
lock had been broken or a wall had been broken.

02:39:53.664 --> 02:39:55.589
TRAVIS: You said they were protective in nature?

02:39:55.589 --> 02:39:56.400
LIAM: Yeah.

02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:09.149
MARISHA: So three murals. Three creatures--
beings. Three chosen ones. And three different

02:40:09.149 --> 02:40:10.684
eyes in each.

02:40:10.684 --> 02:40:13.525
TALIESIN: A creature of the sea, a creature of the
air with fire--

02:40:13.525 --> 02:40:16.216
MARISHA and TALIESIN: And a creature of the
earth.

02:40:16.216 --> 02:40:22.083
MARISHA: Do I remember anything from hitting the
books in school of some gods?

02:40:22.083 --> 02:40:24.111
MATT: Roll a history check.

02:40:24.111 --> 02:40:25.974
MARISHA: It would be history and not religion?

02:40:25.974 --> 02:40:29.569
MATT: This would be history, technically.
Actually, history or religion.

02:40:29.569 --> 02:40:41.453
MARISHA: Well, they're the same for me. Same
modifier. 17. Her-story!

02:40:41.453 --> 02:40:54.200
MATT: You recall tales-- I mean, there are many
powerful creatures that have existed throughout

02:40:54.341 --> 02:41:06.348
history, entities that are either elemental in
nature or are primal forces of power. There are

02:41:06.348 --> 02:41:10.457
some that are guardians of the world, some that
are guardians of the elements within their own

02:41:10.457 --> 02:41:20.844
planes. There are many types of horrors and
protectors throughout history. Thinking back to

02:41:20.844 --> 02:41:27.292
some of your studies, both historically and in
cracking the tome of the occasional religious

02:41:27.292 --> 02:41:36.490
thing against your better will in your classes,
there are some entities that were left in the wake

02:41:36.490 --> 02:41:41.017
of the Divergence: avatar-like entities, or at
least creations that were meant to be an extension

02:41:41.017 --> 02:41:51.497
of the power of the gods. Some of them are
guardians in the world, some of them still remain

02:41:51.497 --> 02:41:57.553
true to the religions or the gods that created
them. Some, over time, have found their own

02:41:57.553 --> 02:42:07.087
interests. Some have grown obsessed with their own
power without their creator and master to chastise

02:42:07.087 --> 02:42:15.826
or watch over them, and see themselves as a new
god, even. Thinking back, you don't have all the

02:42:15.826 --> 02:42:26.262
information, but you do know that-- thinking back
to the murals and things you've heard about

02:42:26.262 --> 02:42:33.896
Uk'otoa being said, Uk'otoa was worshipped by the
Ki'Nau, which were the indigenous people of the

02:42:33.896 --> 02:42:42.004
Menagerie Coast and the Swavain Islands in the
vicinity. Uk'otoa was one of these avatar entities

02:42:42.004 --> 02:42:53.103
that was created by Zehir, the Cloaked Serpent, to
be one of its many ambassadors of power and one of

02:42:53.103 --> 02:42:59.564
its greatest warriors in the conflict of the
Calamity.

02:42:59.564 --> 02:43:01.895
MARISHA: Big kaijus-kind of thing?

02:43:01.895 --> 02:43:07.577
MATT: Essentially. When Zehir and the rest of the
betrayer gods were banished along with the other

02:43:07.577 --> 02:43:16.530
prime deities, they were now the most powerful
beings on the surface of Exandria. As such, new

02:43:16.530 --> 02:43:24.861
religions began to spring up around them. The
Ki'Nau of this area took to worshipping Uk'otoa,

02:43:24.861 --> 02:43:35.732
and Uk'otoa began to preside like the next best
god there was. You get the sense that these other

02:43:35.732 --> 02:43:47.565
two entities might be similar relics of this time:
powerful beings created before or during the

02:43:47.565 --> 02:43:55.942
Calamity and then left with their gods now sealed
away to become forces of power of their own. You

02:43:55.942 --> 02:44:00.408
don't know if they've been sealed in the same fate
that Uk'otoa was. But based on what you saw in

02:44:00.408 --> 02:44:09.448
that temple, they seem to be connected or at
least, have similar structure of worship.

02:44:09.448 --> 02:44:12.365
TRAVIS: This is some heavy shit.

02:44:12.365 --> 02:44:20.892
MARISHA: I say all of that. I read this one
paragraph once and then the filigree, there was a

02:44:21.178 --> 02:44:29.053
monk with a trumpet up his ass, and that's why I
remembered this section so well. In fact, still

02:44:29.053 --> 02:44:32.145
remember the book. Bet if we go back to the
library, we could still find it and we could

02:44:32.145 --> 02:44:33.303
figure out more about this.

02:44:33.303 --> 02:44:37.094
MATT: If you were to find a place of deep
research, you could probably find more information

02:44:37.094 --> 02:44:38.876
about these entities, yes.

02:44:38.876 --> 02:44:41.460
TRAVIS: That would be a choice.

02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:46.662
MARISHA: Speaking of choice, what's yours?

02:44:46.662 --> 02:44:53.130
LIAM: Yeah, she said for all of us to hear that
the real reward comes from releasing the serpent.

02:44:53.130 --> 02:44:56.252
Is that your intentions? Is that what you desire?

02:44:56.252 --> 02:44:57.679
TRAVIS: No!

02:44:57.679 --> 02:44:59.572
MARISHA: It feels like she has bigger plans.

02:44:59.572 --> 02:45:06.063
TRAVIS: I'm not a crazy person, all right? A giant
serpent from the Calamity?

02:45:06.063 --> 02:45:08.701
MARISHA: The Divergence, yeah.

02:45:08.701 --> 02:45:14.569
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's some medieval shit. That is
bigger than anything I've ever heard of.

02:45:14.569 --> 02:45:16.057
LIAM: So what are we doing?

02:45:16.057 --> 02:45:20.835
SAM: Are we pirates now? Is that the thing?
Because I don't like the water at all. I don't

02:45:20.835 --> 02:45:22.624
want to be on a boat anymore.

02:45:22.624 --> 02:45:29.899
TRAVIS: I know, and Caduceus, I know your
experiences with water have been less than thrilling.

02:45:30.254 --> 02:45:38.744
MARISHA: I've actually had a good time. I've died
a few times, but I'm great.

02:45:38.744 --> 02:45:47.319
TALIESIN: I think the question really is what
we're going to have to do about this. I mean, this

02:45:47.319 --> 02:45:53.068
is the direction that we're heading. This is
what's being put in front of us. I don't know if

02:45:53.068 --> 02:46:03.519
running headlong into the next temple is the best
option. I think maybe if you didn't find the

02:46:03.519 --> 02:46:08.260
answers you were looking for down in the water,
maybe it's time to look somewhere else.

02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:17.267
SAM: If I might, Fjord. I don't know much about
how this magic works, but if there's three of

02:46:17.267 --> 02:46:28.183
these things, right, at least three of these eyes
that need to be placed to unlock three temples of

02:46:28.183 --> 02:46:36.612
whatever and release the crazy thing under the
ocean. One has been activated, one is inside you,

02:46:36.612 --> 02:46:46.418
there's one-- maybe we should try to find <i>that</i>
one. With that one, we could then safely get the

02:46:46.418 --> 02:46:52.133
one out of you because we would have the third one
and we could go break it somewhere and then we'd

02:46:52.133 --> 02:46:54.664
know that no one could unlock it ever.

02:46:54.664 --> 02:47:00.625
TRAVIS: I'm all for trying to get knowledge out of
the captain. She seemed to act like she knew who

02:47:00.625 --> 02:47:04.192
the third person was, or had been.

02:47:04.192 --> 02:47:15.517
MARISHA: She also seems very interested in you.
And don't get me wrong, she's hot and all, but I

02:47:15.517 --> 02:47:22.999
question her motives. Feels like she's-- I don't
know.

02:47:22.999 --> 02:47:26.266
LIAM: She looks at him like a skeleton key; she
needs him for what she wants.

02:47:26.266 --> 02:47:32.381
MARISHA: I agree with that, and I think she's
understood that her sexuality can be wielded as a weapon.

02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:42.261
TRAVIS: I see that, as well. Thank you for the
lookout. Frankly, between us, I actually tried to

02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:48.270
keep her underwater, after. She got away real
fast.

02:47:48.270 --> 02:47:49.601
MARISHA: Oh, that's fucking brutal.

02:47:49.601 --> 02:47:53.649
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then I had to act like, "No,
look at the ground." It was terrible, fucking failed.

02:47:53.649 --> 02:47:57.534
TALIESIN: All things considered, I think it would
be best if we left on good terms.

02:47:57.534 --> 02:48:02.075
TRAVIS: I agree. I'd like to find out what she
knows about the third, and then maybe ask for a

02:48:02.075 --> 02:48:07.304
bit of respite before we continue. I actually do
not feel very comfortable--

02:48:07.304 --> 02:48:10.774
TALIESIN: Let's get to port and restock, and
that's when we'll figure out--

02:48:10.774 --> 02:48:13.777
LIAM: I doubt she would allow us to leave on any
terms.

02:48:13.777 --> 02:48:15.271
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:48:15.271 --> 02:48:17.228
LIAM: She needs what's in him.

02:48:17.228 --> 02:48:25.322
SAM: What if we surprise her, tie her up, then
Jester can do her Zone of Truth thing. We can find

02:48:25.322 --> 02:48:29.953
out everything she knows, slit her throat, and
sink her ship.

02:48:29.953 --> 02:48:37.949
TRAVIS: See, I would be all for that, given the
circumstances of what Beau just outlined. Big

02:48:37.949 --> 02:48:48.729
consequences looming that are age-old, timeless
things. But if she can control water now, I would

02:48:48.729 --> 02:48:54.929
be concerned that that effort might fall short,
and then we'd be super fucked. I don't know what

02:48:54.929 --> 02:48:56.361
her abilities are.

02:48:56.361 --> 02:49:02.753
TALIESIN: Perhaps some sign of agreement to share
information with the understanding that you're

02:49:02.753 --> 02:49:06.619
both working towards the same goals, and maybe it
would be better to have two groups doing this

02:49:06.619 --> 02:49:07.811
instead of one.

02:49:07.811 --> 02:49:18.323
TRAVIS: Yes. I need more info, Caleb. I need more
data, more knowledge. You read books on this

02:49:18.323 --> 02:49:23.595
stuff. There has to be someone out there that
knows more about this before we just charge in.

02:49:23.595 --> 02:49:26.621
TALIESIN: She's already said that she's sent
people out to do this work. It wouldn't be that

02:49:26.621 --> 02:49:28.175
much different, I suppose.

02:49:28.175 --> 02:49:32.303
TRAVIS: If we have what she needs, she'll have to
play nice.

02:49:32.303 --> 02:49:38.087
SAM: What if we just leave her? She could go off
and do god knows what.

02:49:38.087 --> 02:49:39.542
TALIESIN: As opposed to what?

02:49:39.542 --> 02:49:42.765
SAM: He can stay with her, we can stop it before
she does it.

02:49:42.765 --> 02:49:47.604
TRAVIS: I think she's only interested in the one
creature, so she's only interested in this type of

02:49:47.604 --> 02:49:54.194
eye. I don't even want to start to think about the
onyx eyes or the ivory eyes.

02:49:54.194 --> 02:49:59.153
LIAM: If we want to leave, we are not going to
walk away; we're going to sneak away. She's not

02:49:59.153 --> 02:50:03.526
going to let go of you. You are a key that she
needs. She said herself that greater things come

02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:12.110
when the serpent is released. The giant, god-like
serpent. I would ask you-- we're all here. We like

02:50:12.110 --> 02:50:20.705
you, and if you are being completely forthright
with us, we're good, but if we get the slightest

02:50:20.705 --> 02:50:26.733
whiff that you are after what this woman is
after-- Well, I can't speak for them; I'm not

02:50:26.733 --> 02:50:28.514
interested in being here anymore.

02:50:28.514 --> 02:50:38.699
MATT: Yasha puts her hand on your shoulder and
says, "Faith is a funny thing. Be careful where

02:50:38.699 --> 02:50:53.213
you place it. It can give strength, or it can lead
to terrible things."

02:50:53.213 --> 02:51:08.153
TRAVIS: Thank you, Yasha. I understand your
concern, Caleb, I do. I have a small curiosity

02:51:08.395 --> 02:51:19.247
from the things that I've seen. I have no interest
in dealing with matters that predate time as we

02:51:19.247 --> 02:51:31.358
know it. I'm pretty simple. These days I've spent
with you are the most exciting of my entire life.

02:51:31.358 --> 02:51:38.156
I'm not looking to end them, or the world, by
frivolously giving up something that I barely

02:51:38.156 --> 02:51:48.111
understand. I'd like to try to ask if we can go
separate ways and if she says no, I would play

02:51:48.111 --> 02:51:56.344
that we would join her and her voyages in the
morning and then sneak away. I'd like to try and

02:51:56.344 --> 02:51:58.264
do it amicably, if we can.

02:51:58.264 --> 02:52:05.879
MARISHA: I don't think there's anything wrong with
maybe asking for The Mist. I think maybe Caduceus

02:52:06.199 --> 02:52:11.897
has a good point, if we can convince her that
we're still part of her crew by doing our own recon.

02:52:11.897 --> 02:52:18.259
TALIESIN: To be honest, it would be worth actually
following through with it anyway. She knows things

02:52:18.259 --> 02:52:20.562
that we don't. We get to find out.

02:52:20.562 --> 02:52:23.838
MARISHA: We took all that time to learn how to
sail the damn thing.

02:52:23.838 --> 02:52:28.399
LIAM: Also, that boat is fucked and they could
shoot us to bloody hell if they wanted to, so it

02:52:28.399 --> 02:52:32.414
won't be that big of a stretch if we wanted
private sleeping quarters.

02:52:32.414 --> 02:52:38.422
TRAVIS: For sure. I think either way we have to
make it to Darktow. And we need a second ship.

02:52:38.422 --> 02:52:43.605
Third, if she doesn't have a specific location,
two ships find that thing faster than one.

02:52:43.605 --> 02:52:44.869
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:52:44.869 --> 02:52:46.608
TALIESIN: That's true.

02:52:46.608 --> 02:52:52.074
TRAVIS: What do you say? We'll have to play along
until we get to Darktow, and it is not somewhere

02:52:52.074 --> 02:52:55.601
that you normally want to go if you're not of the
pirate variety.

02:52:55.601 --> 02:53:02.657
LIAM: None of us have any chance, any other option
but to play along.

02:53:02.657 --> 02:53:07.094
TALIESIN: Is this some sort of pirate town?

02:53:07.094 --> 02:53:13.649
TRAVIS: I think it's a pirate island. It's a
hideaway. You don't go there unless you're looking

02:53:13.649 --> 02:53:16.987
for trouble, or unless you are the trouble.

02:53:16.987 --> 02:53:26.523
MARISHA: Hee! That's awesome. Speaking of trouble,
are you going to take her up on that glass of wine?

02:53:28.292 --> 02:53:29.260
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:53:29.260 --> 02:53:32.543
MARISHA: That she has mentioned three times.

02:53:32.543 --> 02:53:34.881
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:53:34.881 --> 02:53:36.510
LIAM: What's Jester doing right now?

02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:37.320
MATT: Fuming.

02:53:37.320 --> 02:53:39.978
SAM: She's just touching her lips.

02:53:39.978 --> 02:53:45.668
TALIESIN: Jester's carving something into the bow
of the boat and we don't know what. She's got the

02:53:45.668 --> 02:53:49.330
axe and she's moving it in a direction without
looking.

02:53:49.330 --> 02:53:54.520
TRAVIS: I suppose I should, to keep relations up.

02:53:54.520 --> 02:54:00.682
LIAM: Yeah, well, you do what you have to.

02:54:03.862 --> 02:54:14.396
TRAVIS: Yes. All right, I'll see you all
underneath.

02:54:16.219 --> 02:54:24.938
SAM: Wait. Take this vial of acid, just in case. I
don't know. Maybe she'll try something and you

02:54:24.938 --> 02:54:26.625
just splash it in her face. I don't know.

02:54:26.625 --> 02:54:27.618
TRAVIS: In her face?

02:54:27.618 --> 02:54:28.406
SAM: I don't know!

02:54:28.406 --> 02:54:29.605
TRAVIS: I think it just burns.

02:54:29.605 --> 02:54:31.418
SAM: Sure, whatever.

02:54:31.418 --> 02:54:32.556
TRAVIS: Is it magic acid?

02:54:32.556 --> 02:54:33.728
SAM: Nope, just acid.

02:54:33.728 --> 02:54:35.334
TRAVIS: Okay. Did you make this?

02:54:35.334 --> 02:54:36.037
SAM: I did.

02:54:36.037 --> 02:54:37.462
TRAVIS: Thank you!

02:54:37.462 --> 02:54:40.488
TALIESIN: Are we now going to go and sleep and
properly sleep?

02:54:40.488 --> 02:54:43.733
SAM: No not until he comes back from his
rendezvous.

02:54:43.733 --> 02:54:49.021
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to go to sleep. I
don't know about the rest of you. I'm going to pat

02:54:49.021 --> 02:54:52.679
him on the shoulder and, just for fun, cast
Protection from Poison.

02:54:52.679 --> 02:54:54.340
TRAVIS: Ooh!

02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:55.969
TALIESIN: You've got an hour.

02:54:55.969 --> 02:55:02.713
TRAVIS: Okay. All right. Thank you, Caduceus. I'm
going to make you a fan of water before your life

02:55:02.713 --> 02:55:04.571
is done, I swear.

02:55:04.571 --> 02:55:10.330
TALIESIN: I don't mind it. I think I just have an
issue with the things that are in it and being

02:55:10.330 --> 02:55:15.123
under it and I'm going to go to sleep and probably,
yeah, throw up a little.

02:55:15.123 --> 02:55:16.523
SAM: I don't like it at all.

02:55:16.523 --> 02:55:20.645
TRAVIS: You're going to be my strongest acolyte.
You're going to preach the words of the water.

02:55:20.645 --> 02:55:22.172
SAM: It's terrible.

02:55:22.172 --> 02:55:27.174
TRAVIS: It's really not. I mean, look how good
you're doing, right? Thriving. Surviving.

02:55:27.174 --> 02:55:30.579
SAM: This was the worst day of my life.

02:55:30.579 --> 02:55:34.758
TALIESIN: I can't leave yet.

02:55:34.758 --> 02:55:38.239
TRAVIS: Your whole life?

02:55:38.239 --> 02:55:49.277
SAM: I mean, as far as I can remember. This was a
really bad day, and water had a lot to do with it.

02:55:49.526 --> 02:55:55.818
(laughter)

02:55:55.818 --> 02:56:00.111
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. I'll get back to you on that.

02:56:00.111 --> 02:56:01.627
SAM: Sure.

02:56:01.627 --> 02:56:04.586
TRAVIS: I'll make my way towards the captain's
quarters.

02:56:04.586 --> 02:56:07.342
TALIESIN: We're going to figure out a way for you
to breath underwater. It's going to be okay.

02:56:07.342 --> 02:56:10.909
SAM: Oh, I don't care about being underwater. I
just don't like looking at it.

02:56:10.909 --> 02:56:13.887
TALIESIN: Come on.

02:56:13.887 --> 02:56:17.016
MATT: So you guys all go to rest?

02:56:17.016 --> 02:56:19.103
LIAM: Yeah, I'm exhausted.

02:56:19.103 --> 02:56:20.790
MATT: All right. You guys go to rest.

02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:22.469
TALIESIN: A long rest.

02:56:22.469 --> 02:56:25.236
MATT: You head your way to the captain's
quarters?

02:56:25.236 --> 02:56:26.412
TRAVIS: I do.

02:56:26.412 --> 02:56:32.629
MATT: All right. You head to the door. It's
closed. (knocking) For a moment, you hear this

02:56:32.629 --> 02:56:35.984
sound of rushing water.

02:56:35.984 --> 02:56:37.438
LIAM: She's cleaning up.

02:56:37.438 --> 02:56:39.027
TRAVIS: I'll try the door.

02:56:39.027 --> 02:56:47.183
MATT: Okay, it opens up. It's the normal office
den set up, but there's the balcony out back that

02:56:47.183 --> 02:56:52.446
opens up, and there on the balcony, Avantika is
standing on the balcony and there's this column of

02:56:52.446 --> 02:57:03.183
water that is rising up out of the ocean. She's
nude. It's washing her. She's in the process, in

02:57:03.183 --> 02:57:10.634
the throes of manipulating this water. She's
learning whatever this new gifted power that she

02:57:10.634 --> 02:57:19.809
has. Her hair is twirling up into the stream and
it's this beautiful almost-dance between her and

02:57:19.809 --> 02:57:26.855
this elemental force that she now has. She looks
back over her shoulder at you, knowing that you've

02:57:26.855 --> 02:57:31.702
been there for at least a couple minutes. "I'll be
just a moment."

02:57:31.702 --> 02:57:34.479
TRAVIS: Don't rush on my account.

02:57:34.479 --> 02:57:44.181
MATT: Eventually the water splashes down and off
the side. She walks back out of the night air and

02:57:44.424 --> 02:57:46.957
pulls her hair up and ties it off.

02:57:46.957 --> 02:57:48.772
LIAM: I've seen this film.

02:57:48.772 --> 02:57:53.507
MATT: She takes a little silk robe and places it
over her and sits down. There are already two

02:57:53.507 --> 02:58:00.554
glasses places on the table. She uncorks it and
pours two glasses.

02:58:00.554 --> 02:58:02.336
TRAVIS: To your success.

02:58:02.336 --> 02:58:06.137
MATT: "To <i>our</i> success in time, eh?"

02:58:06.137 --> 02:58:13.003
TRAVIS: One can hope. It's only fair; you've been
on this journey far longer than I have.

02:58:13.003 --> 02:58:25.179
MATT: "This is true." Not the best wine you've
had, but it's serviceable.

02:58:25.179 --> 02:58:26.805
TRAVIS: Not aerated.

02:58:26.805 --> 02:58:38.398
MATT: "I am excited for you to experience this."

02:58:38.398 --> 02:58:42.870
TRAVIS: I am as well. Is it everything you thought
it would be?

02:58:42.870 --> 02:58:50.655
MATT: "I've only but scratched the surface, and
I've never felt a connection like this with the

02:58:50.655 --> 02:59:00.930
"sea that has been my life. It's incredible. I can
only do it in bursts, but I can cause it to swell

02:59:00.930 --> 02:59:09.232
"and move and part and flood and shift. It's--
(sighs). Soon." She reaches out and touches the

02:59:09.232 --> 02:59:19.705
top of your hand. "Soon. I promise. Now, we were
talking before and I think it's only fair." She

02:59:19.705 --> 02:59:32.094
takes another big sip. "Your blade is very
interesting. I knew one other who had a blade very

02:59:32.094 --> 02:59:38.684
"similar. Referred to it as the Sword of Fathoms."

02:59:40.884 --> 02:59:43.262
TRAVIS: Sword of Fathoms?

02:59:45.072 --> 02:59:47.626
MATT: "The previous chosen."

02:59:50.886 --> 02:59:54.610
TRAVIS: Can you tell me more about this person who
wielded it?

02:59:56.200 --> 02:59:58.778
MATT: "His name was Vandren."

03:00:00.888 --> 03:00:03.382
MARISHA: (whispering) Fuck!

03:00:03.382 --> 03:00:13.811
MATT: "A fine sailor and a foolish coward he ended
up to be, but he was the one that... opened my eyes

03:00:13.817 --> 03:00:24.679
"to the destiny of Uk'otoa. We traveled together
for a number of years before he just abandoned and

03:00:24.679 --> 03:00:34.556
"absconded with something important. I've been
trying to find out where he went, but he is very

03:00:34.556 --> 03:00:47.669
"slippery. Wherever he is, either what you have in
your sword is what he took away or wherever he is

03:00:47.669 --> 03:00:49.968
"he has the third with him."

03:00:53.198 --> 03:01:03.446
TRAVIS: This Vandren, you say he told you about
the Sword of Fathoms or he <i>had</i> a Sword of Fathoms?

03:01:04.152 --> 03:01:05.837
MATT: "He carried the same blade."

03:01:05.837 --> 03:01:15.655
TRAVIS: The same one. Was there an area, a
destination, a direction that you last knew that

03:01:15.655 --> 03:01:20.378
he was going? Is it in our interest to try and
find him?

03:01:20.378 --> 03:01:33.778
MATT: "It is very much in our interests. We were
going to go and visit this very island some time

03:01:33.778 --> 03:01:41.152
"ago when he was the only one to have one of these
orbs."

03:01:43.262 --> 03:01:49.631
TRAVIS: How did you find, if you don't mind me
asking, yours?

03:01:51.367 --> 03:02:06.822
MATT: "Well-- I had to kill a number of men. It
was being auctioned off in Port Damali, and there

03:02:06.822 --> 03:02:20.018
"was a collector. Word had gotten to us that this
artifact was sold off to this individual. Well,

03:02:20.018 --> 03:02:23.765
"needless to say, he put up a bit of a struggle."

03:02:23.765 --> 03:02:26.453
TRAVIS: I'm sure he did.

03:02:26.453 --> 03:02:33.402
MATT: "Thankfully this collector enjoyed nights
long at sea and that happens to be our specialty.

03:02:33.402 --> 03:02:42.850
"His corpse now adorns one of the many beautiful
islands and now I have this beautiful reminder."

03:02:42.850 --> 03:02:49.332
The hand, you can see, it's now mostly healed
over, but there is a scar where this orb once

03:02:49.332 --> 03:02:51.213
resided in her palm.

03:02:51.213 --> 03:02:58.481
TRAVIS: I'll stand and just pace around the
quarters, looking at the various iconography of

03:02:58.481 --> 03:02:59.586
the serpent.

03:02:59.586 --> 03:03:06.385
MATT: As you're pacing, she talks towards you.
"It's very interesting that you carry the same

03:03:06.385 --> 03:03:21.200
"blade as Vandren did and come to me with what
could very well be the same orb. Do you know this

03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:23.159
"one? This Vandren?"

03:03:23.159 --> 03:03:29.222
TRAVIS: I don't. We should find him.

03:03:29.222 --> 03:03:31.110
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:03:33.170 --> 03:03:39.264
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter) 23.

03:03:39.264 --> 03:03:42.257
SAM: Contested!

03:03:42.257 --> 03:03:48.487
(no audio)

03:03:48.487 --> 03:03:49.876
MATT: "Hmm."

03:03:53.006 --> 03:04:07.012
TRAVIS: (long sigh) This sword came to me in a very unusual
way. I've been a sailor for many years myself and

03:04:07.175 --> 03:04:13.596
was lost at sea during a storm. When I woke up, I
found myself on the shore, and there in the waves

03:04:13.596 --> 03:04:22.891
next to me was this sword. I don't know how I got
there, but as soon as I grasped it, it changed

03:04:22.891 --> 03:04:32.714
<i>everything</i>. The sword, however, did not have the
eye. The eye we found later, my companions and me.

03:04:32.714 --> 03:04:37.572
MATT: "Who else was on this ship with you?"

03:04:37.572 --> 03:04:45.814
TRAVIS: Various other sailors. Our captain.

03:04:45.814 --> 03:04:48.454
MATT: "Who was your captain?"

03:04:48.454 --> 03:04:52.438
TRAVIS: Captain Twitchwood. Do you know him?

03:04:52.438 --> 03:05:08.119
MATT: She smiles. "I appreciate that you are a
very accomplished liar. But so am I. The only

03:05:08.119 --> 03:05:16.725
"reason why I still sit here before you with the
dozen or so scars I carry is because I have been

03:05:16.725 --> 03:05:20.518
"very keen at seeing through the same skill."

03:05:20.518 --> 03:05:26.649
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) A 23 level skill? Okay.

03:05:30.019 --> 03:05:33.727
LIAM: His name is Captain Wiggledick.

03:05:33.727 --> 03:05:41.900
TRAVIS: Then I'm sure you can understand the need
for secrecy for a small circle.

03:05:41.900 --> 03:05:46.723
MATT: "You know Vandren, don't you?"

03:05:46.723 --> 03:05:49.695
TRAVIS: I do.

03:05:49.695 --> 03:05:56.656
MATT: "And he was on this ship that you
shipwrecked on, eh? Do you remember where this

03:05:56.656 --> 03:05:58.851
"storm was?"

03:05:58.851 --> 03:06:02.100
TRAVIS: I remember where we found the stone.

03:06:02.100 --> 03:06:05.213
MATT: "Do you remember where the storm was?"

03:06:05.213 --> 03:06:06.728
TRAVIS: The storm.

03:06:06.728 --> 03:06:08.951
MATT: "That sunk the ship you were on?"

03:06:08.951 --> 03:06:10.826
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:06:10.826 --> 03:06:16.009
MATT: "This was the last time you saw Vandren?"

03:06:16.009 --> 03:06:24.929
TRAVIS: I feel like you know the rest of this
story, and I am at a disadvantage.

03:06:24.929 --> 03:06:30.920
MATT: "I don't necessarily-- I have not seen
Vandren since he absconded with this-- many

03:06:30.920 --> 03:06:42.549
"things. But he will not travel with both that
sword you carry and the orb he stole from us. So

03:06:42.549 --> 03:06:51.983
"wherever that ship has sunken, there's a very good
chance that it has the third missing orb. Do you

03:06:51.983 --> 03:06:55.071
"remember where the ship sunk?"

03:06:55.071 --> 03:06:59.488
TRAVIS: (sighing)

03:06:59.488 --> 03:07:04.418
MATT: She reaches out and pulls out a map and
rolls it out on the table in before you. Put your

03:07:04.418 --> 03:07:05.308
map up.

03:07:05.308 --> 03:07:07.102
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah--

03:07:07.102 --> 03:07:08.408
SAM: Just splash acid all over it!

03:07:08.408 --> 03:07:12.591
(laughter)

03:07:12.591 --> 03:07:14.407
SAM: You've got this!

03:07:14.407 --> 03:07:20.917
(background music, rustling)

03:07:20.917 --> 03:07:26.521
TRAVIS: Now, between you and I--

03:07:26.521 --> 03:07:27.385
MATT: Yes.

03:07:27.385 --> 03:07:30.960
TRAVIS: There was a storm-- do I remember?

03:07:30.960 --> 03:07:37.631
MATT: You do recall, actually. It was somewhere
coming back along this trade route and somewhere

03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:41.058
in this space the storm had blown through. This is
where it sank and you washed up--

03:07:41.058 --> 03:07:42.350
TRAVIS: Darktow's over here, right?

03:07:42.350 --> 03:07:44.987
MATT: Darktow's over here. You washed up on this
island, here.

03:07:44.987 --> 03:07:47.150
TRAVIS: We're over here.

03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:54.209
MATT: You guys are over there at Urukaxl. You
washed up over here, so the storm was in this vicinity.

03:07:54.481 --> 03:08:07.716
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. Yep. Fuck it. 
Yes, I do remember where the ship sank.

03:08:07.716 --> 03:08:15.693
MATT: "Then, my friend, I think we are going to do
even more amazing things together."

03:08:15.693 --> 03:08:26.858
TRAVIS: I agree. I believe that will have to wait
until we find ourselves on Darktow, though.

03:08:26.858 --> 03:08:36.007
MATT: "I have been patient this long. I can be
patient a bit further. Very well." She leans

03:08:36.007 --> 03:08:44.072
forward with the wine glass, very close, and goes,
"It's been a very long day. I think rest is in order?"

03:08:44.072 --> 03:08:50.914
TRAVIS: (laughter) I would agree.

03:08:50.914 --> 03:09:07.439
MATT: She takes a big, long drink of wine, sets it
down. "Well, there are ways to complete a hopeful

03:09:07.439 --> 03:09:12.713
"future pact together. Many different ways."

03:09:12.713 --> 03:09:14.621
(laughter)

03:09:14.621 --> 03:09:16.373
SAM: (whispering) Yes! Yes! Yes!

03:09:20.265 --> 03:09:23.046
LIAM: Fade to tentacles.

03:09:23.046 --> 03:09:37.405
TRAVIS: (stuttering) Yeah, I'm going to go for it.
I'm going for it. I will-- (noises of distress).

03:09:37.405 --> 03:09:50.787
Oh god, okay. Yep, yep, yep. I will keep
Avantika's hand and walk around the desk, and I

03:09:50.787 --> 03:09:55.736
will try the old lean-in and see what the reaction
is.

03:09:55.736 --> 03:09:58.824
MATT: Man, all right.

03:09:58.824 --> 03:10:02.555
SAM: Oh man, I'm getting some Twitchwood right
now.

03:10:02.555 --> 03:10:10.386
(laughter)

03:10:10.386 --> 03:10:17.169
MATT: Quickly, her hand grabs the back of your
head and pulls you in.

03:10:17.169 --> 03:10:22.580
TALIESIN: I'm very mixed about this whole thing.

03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:23.905
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:10:25.575 --> 03:10:33.436
MATT: She's a very powerful woman, and you find
yourself very quickly overpowered. You are allowed to--

03:10:34.184 --> 03:10:40.778
(laughter)

03:10:40.778 --> 03:10:51.768
MATT: For the sake of brevity... Not the most
restful evening you've had, but an evening is had.

03:10:51.768 --> 03:10:54.267
LIAM: How many points of exhaustion?

03:10:54.267 --> 03:10:58.980
MARISHA: Make a constitution check.

03:10:58.980 --> 03:11:05.186
MATT: No, I'm never going to do that in a game.
Sure, go for it, then. That's your own--

03:11:05.186 --> 03:11:06.590
TRAVIS: 16.

03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:08.424
MARISHA: Eyy!

03:11:08.424 --> 03:11:11.399
MATT: (in despair) No... No...

03:11:11.399 --> 03:11:15.845
LIAM: You succeed the check, but you disappoint
your dungeon master.

03:11:15.845 --> 03:11:23.669
MATT: I wouldn't call it a romantic evening, but a
very--

03:11:23.669 --> 03:11:26.496
TRAVIS: An adrenaline--

03:11:26.496 --> 03:11:30.867
MATT: Union of two business partners of a similar
goal.

03:11:30.867 --> 03:11:34.361
SAM: The sound of fish slapping against each
other.

03:11:34.361 --> 03:11:36.672
(laughter)

03:11:36.672 --> 03:11:39.461
SAM: They're both of the sea.

03:11:39.461 --> 03:11:42.024
LIAM: Right in the blowhole.

03:11:42.024 --> 03:11:44.527
MATT: And we fade to black.

03:11:46.637 --> 03:11:58.232
TRAVIS: Do I make my way back to quarters before
sun-up? I don't know if I want to stay the entire

03:11:58.444 --> 03:11:59.800
evening there.

03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:01.489
MATT: You do fall asleep together.

03:12:01.489 --> 03:12:02.908
TRAVIS: Oh! Okay.

03:12:02.908 --> 03:12:05.679
MATT: Unless you choose to not wish to.

03:12:05.679 --> 03:12:15.733
TRAVIS: No, I'm not going to stay. You don't walk
out of the captain's quarters at sun-up. Plus, I'm

03:12:15.733 --> 03:12:23.289
super tired. I will leave and try to stealth back
to the quarters of everyone else.

03:12:23.289 --> 03:12:25.645
TALIESIN: I have a passive perception of 18.

03:12:25.645 --> 03:12:27.026
MATT: I know.

03:12:27.026 --> 03:12:28.695
TRAVIS: Hopefully you're super asleep.

03:12:28.695 --> 03:12:31.725
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

03:12:31.725 --> 03:12:36.486
TRAVIS: Come on, copper dice gods. 18.

03:12:36.486 --> 03:12:45.780
MATT: All right. You carefully and quietly tiptoe
your way through the hallway to your assigned

03:12:45.780 --> 03:12:48.072
quarters, of which you are sharing with whom?

03:12:48.072 --> 03:12:51.631
TRAVIS and MATT: Caduceus.

03:12:51.631 --> 03:13:01.817
MATT: One eye slowly opens as you are keen to be
somewhat aware-- living alone, out in the

03:13:01.817 --> 03:13:08.107
dangerous wood-- to any sort of aberrant noise in
the vicinity. You hear the faint creak of very

03:13:08.107 --> 03:13:11.746
gentle footsteps as Fjord makes his way into your
chambers.

03:13:14.426 --> 03:13:18.228
TALIESIN: Can I figure out what happened just by
looking at him?

03:13:18.543 --> 03:13:19.416
MATT: You? Yeah.

03:13:19.416 --> 03:13:33.955
(giggling)

03:13:33.975 --> 03:13:37.031
TALIESIN: Sleep well with your bad decisions.

03:13:37.574 --> 03:13:47.650
MATT: As you all rest, a long rest at sea, as the
Squalleater and The Mistake make their way towards

03:13:47.650 --> 03:13:53.183
Darktow to the far west, we'll end tonight's game
there and pick up there next week.

03:13:53.183 --> 03:13:55.289
MARISHA: Aw, no, what?!

03:13:55.289 --> 03:13:57.315
MATT: Also, everyone levels up. Everyone's level
seven now.

03:13:57.315 --> 03:14:00.391
(exclamations)

03:14:00.391 --> 03:14:01.588
MARISHA: Cheers!

03:14:01.588 --> 03:14:04.087
LIAM: Aw, that's a great ending. That's a good
finish.

03:14:04.087 --> 03:14:10.378
MATT: To that degree, while I have you guys here,
let's roll some hit points for those who are present.

03:14:10.836 --> 03:14:12.432
SAM: Do we recover our exhaustion?

03:14:12.432 --> 03:14:18.806
MATT: Over the next couple of days you will
because this is a multi-day travel to get to

03:14:18.806 --> 03:14:22.220
Darktow, so your points of exhaustion will be gone
by the time it matters.

03:14:22.220 --> 03:14:23.971
TRAVIS: I'll let Yasha roll for hers.

03:14:23.971 --> 03:14:27.927
SAM: I should probably roll for Laura. What do you
think? You think she'll appreciate that?

03:14:27.927 --> 03:14:29.927
MATT: It's your head, man.

03:14:29.927 --> 03:14:34.772
TRAVIS: d8 for me, right? Five.

03:14:34.772 --> 03:14:36.856
MARISHA: d8 for me as well.

03:14:36.856 --> 03:14:38.189
LIAM: Pitiful.

03:14:38.189 --> 03:14:43.470
MARISHA: It's a d8 plus your constitution, yeah?
Wow, that's a one. Do we still reroll ones?

03:14:43.470 --> 03:14:45.194
MATT: We reroll ones for hit points.

03:14:45.194 --> 03:14:46.776
MARISHA: That's a two!

03:14:46.776 --> 03:14:47.811
SAM: Nice!

03:14:47.811 --> 03:14:49.409
MATT: It's better.

03:14:49.409 --> 03:14:50.377
MARISHA: Thanks.

03:14:50.377 --> 03:14:52.806
SAM: One. Eight!

03:14:52.806 --> 03:14:54.573
MATT: There you go, Nott.

03:14:54.573 --> 03:14:56.210
SAM: So I reroll a one?

03:14:56.210 --> 03:15:01.475
MATT: I reroll ones for hit points, because
rolling a one for hit points at a level up is the

03:15:01.475 --> 03:15:03.219
fucking worst.

03:15:03.219 --> 03:15:05.125
TALIESIN: Rolling a d8, right?

03:15:05.125 --> 03:15:06.573
MATT: What'd you get, Caleb?

03:15:06.573 --> 03:15:09.673
LIAM: I rolled a two, so a con bonus gets me to
four points up.

03:15:09.673 --> 03:15:10.906
MATT: Four more hit points.

03:15:10.906 --> 03:15:12.097
TALIESIN: Six.

03:15:12.097 --> 03:15:17.157
MATT: Six points to you. To be fair, you guys have
been rolling fucking great for hit points for many

03:15:17.157 --> 03:15:19.423
levels. It's time for there to be some balance.

03:15:19.423 --> 03:15:21.545
SAM: I feel like I should reroll this again.

03:15:21.545 --> 03:15:23.430
MATT: No! Take a good one, dude!

03:15:23.430 --> 03:15:24.963
SAM: (sighing)

03:15:24.963 --> 03:15:27.315
TALIESIN: Stop fighting a success!

03:15:27.315 --> 03:15:29.978
MARISHA: I rolled a two--

03:15:29.978 --> 03:15:36.677
MATT: (growling) I rolled good at hit points. This
is bullshit! You're so weird, Sam!

03:15:36.677 --> 03:15:37.983
SAM: It just feels cheap.

03:15:37.983 --> 03:15:39.379
MATT: How does it feel cheap?!

03:15:39.379 --> 03:15:40.963
SAM: Because I rolled a one first!

03:15:40.963 --> 03:15:46.807
MATT: But I reroll ones because--! I already said
it. As a player, it's the worst feeling. Two sucks

03:15:46.807 --> 03:15:50.795
still, but it doesn't suck as much as a one.
That's how I do it.

03:15:50.795 --> 03:15:53.165
TALIESIN: What do I get at level seven?

03:15:53.165 --> 03:15:59.376
MATT: All right, guys. We're not going to sit here
and subject you guys to us leveling up at the

03:15:59.376 --> 03:16:04.100
table-- although I'm sure there are a few that
would love to see it. We got the important part

03:16:04.100 --> 03:16:09.800
out for you guys. We'll pick up here next week to
see what's in store for the company of the

03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:18.520
Squalleater, of which the Mighty Nein have joined.
The union of partnership of Captain Avantika and

03:16:18.520 --> 03:16:25.675
Fjord and the imminent Darktow in your future.

03:16:25.675 --> 03:16:27.722
LIAM: Seamen, seamen, everywhere.

03:16:27.722 --> 03:16:30.552
SAM and TALIESIN: And not a drop to drink.

03:16:30.572 --> 03:16:37.532
(background chatter)

03:16:37.547 --> 03:16:44.989
MATT: (despairing) You may have broken me. I think it finally
happened. I think you finally broke me. I'm broken

03:16:44.989 --> 03:16:54.485
now. I'm a broken man. On that note, have a
wonderful night. We love you guys, and is it

03:16:54.485 --> 03:16:56.025
Thursday yet? Good night.

03:16:56.025 --> 03:16:58.793
(cheering)

03:16:58.793 --> 03:17:06.613
(no audio)

03:17:06.623 --> 03:29:05.574
[music]
