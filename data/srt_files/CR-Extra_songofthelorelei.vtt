NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.807 --> 00:00:02.069
LIAM: (howling)

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:03.702
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:04.669
LIAM: Hello!

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:05.994
TRAVIS: That's all I wanted!

00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:13.568
LIAM: Welcome to Critical Role, Laura! Welcome!
Guys, thank you for coming to our annual Burning

00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:20.931
Man placeholder episode! My werewolf extravaganza!
I'm so excited to have new players with us

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:27.031
tonight, though. I don't know if the cameras can
see them. Erica Luttrell is here, TJ Storm is

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:37.937
here! These three fools that I'm bored with! Fun
fact: TJ, you've been DMing for how many decades,

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:38.881
did you say?

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:39.694
TJ: Three.

00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:47.930
LIAM: Three decades. So when I inevitably forget
rules, I will either ask TJ what he thinks, or

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.506
pull it out of my ass because I don't care. Very
excited to dig into this, but first we have

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:55.267
announcements. That's how we do this, right?

00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:56.677
SAM, TRAVIS, and LAURA: Yeah.

00:00:56.677 --> 00:01:01.588
LIAM: First off, just announced today, we are
doing a live show in NYC, New York City.

00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:02.415
SAM: Live show!

00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:08.113
LIAM: Live show. Your town. My town. Join us at
the United Palace in Washington Heights on

00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:13.967
Thursday, October 4th. Tickets will be on sale at
12:00pm Eastern via Ticketmaster. Check out the

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:20.345
details at critrole.com. Our first episode of
Handbooker Helper-- that's the name-- which

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:25.794
teaches you the basics of using dice, is live now
at youtube.com/criticalrole.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:26.685
TRAVIS: Please don't sue us.

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:30.886
LIAM: Please don't. Ooh, Dani Carr is sneaking in
like a rogue!

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:32.767
SAM: Laura has the wrong iPad!

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.208
LAURA: Don't get me wrong, it's really great,
because--

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:36.733
SAM: I mean, or tablet device.

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.844
LAURA: Tablet device. I've got Matt's tablet
device.

00:01:38.844 --> 00:01:40.052
DANI: I will get yours.

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:42.577
SAM: Can you find out how our characters--

00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:45.413
LAURA: I know, I can find out a bunch of stuff!
But I probably shouldn't.

00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:46.761
LIAM: There's notes in there?

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.684
LAURA: I mean, it's got all these characters, his
NPCs.

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:50.663
TRAVIS: It wasn't passcode locked?

00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:52.144
LIAM: Shut that down!

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.096
TRAVIS: There was no passcode?

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:54.303
LAURA: I don't think so!

00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:57.422
SAM: Why don't we just make this two hours of us
going through Matt's iPad?

00:01:57.422 --> 00:02:00.848
LIAM: Raiding the cookie jar. We should also talk
about Pablove.

00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:09.148
SAM: Yes, we should. Everybody, as many of you
already know, obviously, a few days ago we

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:15.076
launched a charity campaign with Blair Herter and
the Pablove Foundation, which is devoted to ending

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:21.361
childhood cancer. We're specifically trying to
raise money for a 600 mile bike ride that Blair

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:30.377
and his brother are riding from San Francisco to
LA, and we had all these lofty goals for raising

00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:36.718
money for this ride. We said that if we hit
$20,000, that I would run a one shot. Passed it.

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:44.329
We said if we hit $50,000, of money raised for
this amazing charity from you, the Critters, that

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:51.129
we would be able to fully fund a research grant to
try and end cancer. We hit it, you guys are

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.165
incredible. $50,000 raised for this campaign. It's
incredible. So incredible that we're scrambling to

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:06.858
add other stretch goals! So we just got one in,
it's hot off the presses. If we hit $100,000,

00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:15.031
which is crazy, but also possible, we will be able
to fund the Shutterbugs Summer Camp. An entire

00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:22.701
summer camp where they teach photography to kids
fighting cancer. You could make a kid's summer

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:28.564
camp dreams come true with your donations! So
there'll be more information in the stream or

00:03:28.564 --> 00:03:34.896
whatever. Down here, up here, all around, social
medias. So click donate, be awesome, and thank you

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:40.706
so much for all your generosity so far. It's
really making a difference, and you guys are incredible.

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:45.164
(applause)

00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:49.206
LIAM: There's some kind of shenanigans with Laura
going on over there, so I guess let's talk merch

00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:53.963
announcements. We have got (like Laura) in the
store right now, hey hey hey!

00:03:53.963 --> 00:04:00.286
LAURA: Yeah, in the store right now we've got
crazy things! We've got all the stuff that was

00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:04.293
available-- well hold on, because here's the
thing. So Matt had logged into my iPad. I don't

00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:06.279
remember my password.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:06.849
SAM: What?

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.168
LAURA: I'm just try to figure out, because my
character sheet is on here.

00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:11.046
SAM: It's DiceGirl6969.

00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:15.593
LAURA: That's what it was, thank you. Anywho,
we've got all the stuff from Gen Con,

00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:17.811
(Valley girl voice) like, available in the store,
like, right, now.

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:21.365
SAM: Wait, stuff from Gen Con that was previously
unavailable?

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:30.278
LAURA: In the store? Yeah. So we've got the map.
Wildemount map by Deven Rue, who is amazing and

00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:33.693
the map is amazing. You guys should check it out.
We've got our pins. We've got our Mighty Nein pin

00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:39.416
and our Vox Machina pin, and enamel pins, they're
so cool! We've got a dice set that's a Wildemount

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:42.904
dice set! It's navy blue, we picked out the colors
ourselves!

00:04:42.904 --> 00:04:48.519
TRAVIS: You're like an Italian mob boss right now.
(mumbles)

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:54.747
LAURA: We've got the monogram design was from
Crystal Sharp. We also have a Yasha mini bust.

00:04:54.747 --> 00:05:00.351
It's this big, by Steamforge, and it's really
cool. It's metal, it's heavy, it looks really

00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:02.038
awesome, and it comes in a really cool little
box.

00:05:02.038 --> 00:05:03.610
LIAM: Do we have all our regular stuff too?

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.860
LAURA: All the stuff that was there before is
there now, too! We have more hats coming, because

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.345
I know you guys like them.

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:10.056
SAM: The dad hats?

00:05:10.056 --> 00:05:10.663
LAURA: Yeah, the dad hats.

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:11.447
SAM: They're real cool

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:12.232
LAURA: They are really cool.

00:05:12.232 --> 00:05:15.584
TRAVIS: Wife, you are so cute. You better get rid
of that shit by the time it's time to tear some

00:05:15.584 --> 00:05:16.340
people up!

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.910
LAURA: Whoa, werewolves! Okay, I'm going to sign
in.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:26.297
LIAM: Is there anything else that I'm forgetting
to do? You know why TJ is my favorite guest we've

00:05:26.297 --> 00:05:27.604
ever had? He brought us Red Vines.

00:05:27.604 --> 00:05:34.302
TRAVIS: He did! Oh no, or "nondescript third party
red licorice candy."

00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:34.975
SAM: Sure.

00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:39.482
LIAM: That's what I meant. I meant Grasping Vines,
thank you for the Grasping Vines.

00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:43.441
TRAVIS: We're going to have a live show in New
York! First one ever! Sorry. We're excited.

00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:46.805
SAM: Tickets are on sale, or will be.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:54.727
LIAM: We like D&D here. That having been said, I
think we should take a break so we can come back

00:05:54.727 --> 00:06:01.197
from the break so can play some motherfucking
werewolves. So let's go to break so we can then

00:06:01.197 --> 00:06:03.675
dive into Critical Role.

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:09.421
[click, TV static]

00:06:09.421 --> 00:07:27.251
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:35.575
LIAM: (laughs) That's fun! I don't know why Matt
complains! Welcome back! It is just about time to

00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:39.038
dive into the Song of the Lorelei. Did you do it?
Did you figure it out?!

00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:41.386
LAURA: Well no, I'm getting an email to tell me
what my password is!

00:07:41.386 --> 00:07:45.738
LIAM: Okay, I don't want anyone to think that
Laura is a really bad D&D player, even though she

00:07:45.738 --> 00:07:52.271
is. So Matt for some reason, maybe an act of
sabotage before he left for the desert, signed

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:56.416
into Laura's iPad, and now Laura can't get into
her iPad to get at her--

00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:57.415
LAURA: Tablet device.

00:07:57.415 --> 00:08:02.212
TRAVIS: The real problem is that she never
remembers her frickin' passwords, okay!

00:08:02.212 --> 00:08:03.996
LAURA: You guys, it's all coming together.

00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:11.766
LIAM: Here's the good news. You work on that,
because to begin this game, it is storytime. Oh, I

00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:17.184
get to use all of Matt's toys! Where does he get
these wonderful toys? Did it do it?

00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:18.482
SAM: Yeah, there's music.

00:08:18.482 --> 00:08:26.772
LIAM: It did it. On the edges of the Cyrengreen
Forest, not too terribly far from the city of

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:38.495
Deastok, on the continent of Wildemount, stands
Lorelei Castle, home for many generations to the

00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:46.272
Lorelei family. The Lorelei bloodline stretches
back almost three centuries but only rose to

00:08:46.272 --> 00:08:52.137
prominence during the war between the Dwendalian
Empire, which we now reside within, and the Julous

00:08:52.137 --> 00:08:58.167
Dominion, which once ruled the southern half of
the Marrow Valley in the preceding age. The

00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:03.012
Loreleis proved their worth in that conflict and
were gifted for their service with a stretch of

00:09:03.012 --> 00:09:14.514
land that you five siblings were born and raised
on. It was also during the bloody struggles of

00:09:14.514 --> 00:09:21.405
that long past war that the bloodline would be
changed forever. During a near fatal encounter,

00:09:21.405 --> 00:09:29.991
your ancestor, Alfarr Lorelei, was bitten, near
the end days of the war. The curse of lycanthropy

00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:37.974
burned its way into the blood of Alfarr in a
relentless fever that nearly drove him mad, but he

00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:51.554
did not bend to it. He persisted, as did his
daughter, and her sons, and so on. The family's

00:09:51.554 --> 00:09:56.113
secret has been closely guarded over the
centuries, and in its earliest days, the curse was

00:09:56.113 --> 00:10:08.157
seen as just that, a curse. But with time came
acceptance, and the responsibility of power. Once

00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:14.236
of age, Lorelei youths eventually undergo The
Taming of their wilder nature and their

00:10:14.236 --> 00:10:21.043
animalistic blood, and it has largely been
responsible for the family's ascension over many a

00:10:21.043 --> 00:10:27.889
generation. Some have faltered. There have
certainly been dark periods in the Lorelei

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:35.616
history, individuals who let their baser impulses
rule them. But the family always returned to the

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:41.049
right and the good. Aurra.

00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:43.078
ERICA: Yes.

00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:47.275
LIAM: Lucius. "Lu-see-us" or "Lu-shus?"

00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:48.415
TJ: "Lu-see-us."

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:51.054
LIAM: Portia.

00:10:51.054 --> 00:10:52.225
LAURA: Hello.

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:56.894
LIAM: And the twins, Benicio and Lawrence.

00:10:56.894 --> 00:10:57.695
SAM: Bro.

00:10:57.695 --> 00:10:59.155
TRAVIS: What's up, brother?

00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:04.895
LIAM: You know a little of this struggle
yourselves. At least, you hear tell from your

00:11:04.895 --> 00:11:08.475
father-- I love this game.

00:11:08.475 --> 00:11:09.254
TRAVIS: So much.

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:16.532
LIAM: At least you hear tell from your father and
your great aunt Katerine. Your father, Haldur

00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:25.320
Lorelei, never knew his own mother, Genevieve
Lorelei, but by his aunt Katerine's account, she

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:33.003
was unbridled and wild, spurned The Taming,
embraced the animal within more than the family

00:11:33.003 --> 00:11:40.883
would have liked. It led to her doom, they would
say. It was that very nature that drew her into a

00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:48.021
whirlwind romance with a man the family did not
approve of. Haldur, or Hal, was born out of

00:11:48.021 --> 00:11:54.227
wedlock and never knew his mother. She was
murdered not far from the castle grounds and found

00:11:54.227 --> 00:12:04.147
in a wolven heap. Her father was dead, or fled, or
possibly killed Genevieve, the family theorized,

00:12:04.147 --> 00:12:11.903
anyway. The only mother Hal knew was Aunt
Katerine, who loved her sister's son with all her

00:12:11.903 --> 00:12:18.699
heart, raised him well, led him through The
Taming, made him the kind and just nobleman he is

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:28.667
today. Sadly, history repeats and repeats, and
Katerine is mostly the only mother you five have

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:36.101
known either. When your mother Rosalind died
during the birth of the twins, old though she was,

00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:44.120
Katerine dutifully continued her role as the
family matriarch. Aurra, you, as the oldest, and

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:52.509
you, Lucius, two years Aurra's junior, you both
remember Rosalind some, but for all of you, it has

00:12:52.509 --> 00:13:00.753
been old Aunt Kat who sat by your beds as children,
who taught you your letters. And how Haldur and

00:13:00.887 --> 00:13:07.542
Katerine love you! You've grown into your
adulthood with grace and strength and absorb the

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:17.704
lessons of your forebears... to an extent. Aurra,
you were meant to rule this house after your

00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:23.487
father is someday gone, but like your grandmother
Genevieve and others with that wilder streak in

00:13:23.857 --> 00:13:29.711
the family's history, you have eschewed The
Taming. In fact, much to your father's heartache,

00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:36.126
you have chosen instead to wander the wilds,
forsaking civilized nobility entirely. He loves

00:13:36.126 --> 00:13:46.267
you and you love him, but it's been complicated.
Lucius, in a similar vein, you too have chosen a

00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:52.397
path outside of the Lorelei's elder traditions.
You were but a child when you heard the voice of

00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:58.033
the Moonweaver whispering to you by the light of
the full moon. You soon began praying to her

00:13:58.033 --> 00:14:04.392
nightly. When you were old enough to make up your
own mind, you followed her voice to the temple and

00:14:04.392 --> 00:14:15.790
found your second family. It was really Portia,
accomplished and driven Portia, who first fit the

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:23.063
mold of the Lorelei noble. You excelled at
everything, demanded to undergo The Taming two

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:28.339
years early, and while you love your older
siblings dearly, you know if they have no desire

00:14:28.339 --> 00:14:39.890
to rule, you will gladly assume that seat of
power. Then there are the twins. Our two burly,

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.909
hulking twins.

00:14:41.909 --> 00:14:43.351
SAM: Larry.

00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:50.807
LIAM: Studious and serious-minded Larry. Lawrence,
really. You underwent The Taming, as was expected,

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:58.428
and you're prepared to offer what the family
requires, but your true love is logic, reason, and

00:14:58.428 --> 00:15:02.924
the study of this curse that runs through your
family's blood. Perhaps it can be better

00:15:02.924 --> 00:15:12.785
understood and better used for the good of House
Lorelei. If anyone can do so, it is you. Then

00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:14.670
there is you, Benicio.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.250
SAM: Yeah.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:21.026
LIAM: Slightly taller than your twin brother, with
none of the useless fixation on books, you

00:15:21.026 --> 00:15:25.724
couldn't wait to undergo The Taming. You had an
itch for danger from an early age and were

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:29.250
impatient to enter your adult life and flex.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.332
SAM: Fuck yeah.

00:15:30.332 --> 00:15:38.620
LIAM: Power. It was this love of trouble,
actually, that led you to burning your arms so

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.939
badly all those years ago, all in an attempt to
prank your twin by sabotaging one of his

00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:48.492
explorations of alchemy. Lesson somewhat learned.

00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:50.740
SAM: Fire bad.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:59.426
LIAM: Two weeks ago, each of you received
identical letters from your father Haldur,

00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:07.038
summoning you home to Castle Lorelei. Intimated in
those letters is his wish to discuss the family's

00:16:07.038 --> 00:16:14.360
future and the handing down of power within the
family. You all have been spread to the winds the

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.085
last six months to a year, maybe, following the
individual threads that life has laid before you.

00:16:19.085 --> 00:16:27.199
Now, Hal is eager to see his children all around
him again. As yet another token of his love, he

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:33.314
has provided you all with three days and nights of
rest, recuperation, and general pampering together

00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:41.310
at one of the finest inns in Deastok: The Shaded
Bough. It is here that we begin this current verse

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:48.060
in the song of the Lorelei. You are gathered in
the sumptuous dining room of The Shaded Bough.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:54.252
Your breakfast is finished, your bags are packed.
B-O-U-G-H.

00:16:54.252 --> 00:16:56.841
TRAVIS and LAURA: Bough-wow.

00:16:56.841 --> 00:17:03.035
LIAM: Your horses have been prepped for your
departure, and it is raining.

00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:05.567
TRAVIS: I need to hear that shit.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:10.241
LIAM: Yeah, so do I. Where is it? Where is it,
Matthew?

00:17:10.241 --> 00:17:11.251
TRAVIS: Drop me in.

00:17:11.251 --> 00:17:13.259
LIAM: Drop a beat.

00:17:13.259 --> 00:17:22.226
TRAVIS: Should we shake the fucking water off? Oh,
we're people.

00:17:22.226 --> 00:17:30.935
LIAM: The morning is yours. It is about a day's
journey home to Castle Lorelei. You have a way you

00:17:30.935 --> 00:17:36.533
go. We have a shortcut that will get you there
before sun is down, but it does not look as much

00:17:36.533 --> 00:17:39.316
fun as you expected it to be with the heavy rain.

00:17:39.316 --> 00:17:42.925
TRAVIS: Are we inside?

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:49.071
LIAM: Yeah, you just finished your breakfast in a
very fancy dining hall.

00:17:49.071 --> 00:17:51.758
SAM: Have we seen each other in a while, all
together?

00:17:51.758 --> 00:17:57.768
LIAM: You spent the last three days getting
facials, steaming, catching up.

00:17:57.768 --> 00:18:04.856
TRAVIS: After all, brother and sister did need to
have their fleas removed from so much time outside.

00:18:06.195 --> 00:18:07.265
SAM: Good one, bro.

00:18:07.265 --> 00:18:08.085
TRAVIS: Thanks.

00:18:08.085 --> 00:18:09.125
ERICA: Truly?

00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:10.024
TRAVIS: Sorry.

00:18:10.024 --> 00:18:14.336
SAM: You've been gone so long.

00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:15.253
ERICA: I have.

00:18:15.253 --> 00:18:22.763
SAM: Do you feel like you're better than us now?

00:18:22.763 --> 00:18:26.815
ERICA: I feel I'm aware of things other than you
are.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:30.021
SAM: So yeah, you think you're better than us.

00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:32.968
ERICA: You can put it however you'd like,
brother.

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:35.021
SAM: We'll see about that.

00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:39.708
LIAM: I would like to thank whatever videogame
company screamed you hoarse to make you sound so deep.

00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:42.022
TRAVIS: You sound ragged and sexy as <i>eff.</i>

00:18:42.022 --> 00:18:49.520
SAM: This is my normal voice. I do a voice for the
other 130 episodes that we've done.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.582
LIAM: Well, if there's any business you want to
see to, you can certainly can, but we could also

00:18:56.582 --> 00:18:58.170
hit the road, if you'd like.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.459
ERICA: Would anyone like to step out into the
rains?

00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:02.168
LAURA: The path will be covered with mud.

00:19:02.168 --> 00:19:04.103
ERICA: Doesn't that make it better?

00:19:04.103 --> 00:19:05.716
TRAVIS and LAURA: Does it?

00:19:05.716 --> 00:19:10.502
ERICA: I remember why I stayed away.

00:19:10.502 --> 00:19:16.503
TRAVIS: I have no objections to getting started, I
suppose. The sooner the better, right, brother?

00:19:16.503 --> 00:19:19.017
TJ: Of course. Let us begin.

00:19:19.042 --> 00:19:23.422
(laughter)

00:19:23.422 --> 00:19:30.219
LIAM: Hoods up, into the rain. You leave the
Shaded Bough, mount up, and ride out of the larger

00:19:30.498 --> 00:19:37.950
city of Deastok. It's slow going. The visibility
is low, the rain is pouring in sheets, but you are

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:43.073
taking the same path you always have when
traveling between Deastok and your home. The

00:19:43.073 --> 00:19:48.516
quickest route there is following the main road
for three or four hours. There's a particular

00:19:48.516 --> 00:19:53.392
field that you're all familiar with, which, if you
cut across, there is a stream there-- a small river,

00:19:53.392 --> 00:20:01.900
Wispern River-- which you cut over and you can get
home by the end of day. If that's the way you want

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.371
to take, or you can take the long way, which, I
don't know why you would.

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:09.912
LAURA: Well the stream will be flooded with all
this rain.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.399
ERICA: I say we take the long way.

00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:14.612
LAURA: (laughing) Just to fuck with our DM.

00:20:14.612 --> 00:20:22.099
TJ: Before having left, I spoke with the small
folk. I want to know what is going on in the

00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:25.104
nearby lands. Is there any trouble?

00:20:25.104 --> 00:20:33.187
LIAM: There is a great deal of trouble. Not in
these parts, we're more towards the east in

00:20:33.187 --> 00:20:40.023
Wildemount but to the west there is mounting
confrontation with the country of Xhorhas. All the

00:20:40.023 --> 00:20:46.487
military forces have been sent in that direction.
Rumors-- Hey man, I don't know what Matt's

00:20:46.487 --> 00:20:54.862
planning, so let's keep it vague, shall we? But
word has gotten back to you, not generally known,

00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:59.695
but to you Lucius, that it's not been going well
on the front.

00:20:59.695 --> 00:21:02.597
TJ: And in this land, no bandits or anything?

00:21:02.597 --> 00:21:11.474
LIAM: No, there is definitely hiring of-- there is
a criminal element in Deastok and you do keep tabs

00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:15.230
on it, but nothing-- no bump certainly that would
alarm you.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.566
TJ: Very well, we proceed on the long road.

00:21:17.566 --> 00:21:19.220
ERICA: Thank you, brother.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:27.977
LIAM: Okay. So Portia wisely avoids the Wispern
River, anticipating possible flooding, so it's

00:21:27.977 --> 00:21:31.986
going to be a long journey. It will take the
better part of the day; you might not make it by

00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:38.009
sundown this time. In fact, in the interest of
time, we'll say that you ride all day in the wain--

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:40.211
LIAM and LAURA: In da wain?

00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:41.516
LIAM: Mawwaige.

00:21:41.516 --> 00:21:42.659
TRAVIS: (singing) I'm widing in the wain.

00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:49.207
LIAM: (singing) Werewolves in the wain. (speaking)
See, we're very serious here. You spend most of

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:54.521
the day riding and getting sopping wet and
miserable and you are looking forward very much to

00:21:54.521 --> 00:22:01.307
seeing all of the familiar faces who work in the
castle; the cooks, the people in the stable, all

00:22:01.307 --> 00:22:06.338
the familiar faces and catching up with your
father. You maybe are a little anxious about

00:22:06.338 --> 00:22:14.793
seeing him for the first time in a while, but
still. The sun does eventually set and you ride

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:19.280
for a bit in the dark. You do have, in your
belongings, some hooded lanterns which is lucky

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:27.914
because that's the only thing that would stay lit
in weather like this. Castle Lorelei is built on a

00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:35.670
tall hill, a ways from the road on the edge of the
Cyrengreen Forest so you've spent a lot of your

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:44.443
youth poking into those woods and getting into
trouble, you especially. Nostalgia always hits

00:22:44.443 --> 00:22:51.656
when you return. But something is off this time.
Returning home at night-- which you've done

00:22:51.656 --> 00:22:59.924
before, this is not the first, but coming around a
bend about a mile away from Lorelei Castle, you're

00:22:59.924 --> 00:23:05.594
used to seeing lights twinkling on the horizon,
few fires and torches in various places in the

00:23:05.594 --> 00:23:14.841
castle, but you don't see any of that today. It is
pouring rain, it is very dark out, and you're a

00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:17.491
little bumped a mile out from home.

00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:21.107
LAURA: Why isn't the castle lit up?

00:23:21.107 --> 00:23:27.454
SAM: Well, maybe they're trying to conserve torch
light or something?

00:23:27.454 --> 00:23:29.555
TRAVIS: Don't be an idiot, that's not a real
thing.

00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:31.190
SAM: Torches are expensive.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.831
LAURA: They're not expensive.

00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:34.873
TRAVIS: I, too, am concerned.

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:38.030
ERICA: I sense wariness among the woodland
creatures.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.236
SAM: What? Okay.

00:23:41.236 --> 00:23:44.776
(laughter)

00:23:44.776 --> 00:23:52.522
LAURA: Any time father knows we're coming he makes
the castle ready. This is strange.

00:23:52.522 --> 00:23:54.828
SAM: Ooh! Is it a surprise party?

00:23:54.828 --> 00:23:57.164
LAURA: Possible.

00:23:57.164 --> 00:23:59.294
SAM: Luci, it's close to your birthday, isn't it.

00:23:59.294 --> 00:24:09.560
LIAM: Luci, only you notice as you draw even a
little bit nearer that the gates to the castle are

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.816
open as well.

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:21.354
TJ: The gates are open. This is not normal.
Father's fastidious about the gates, the house,

00:24:21.574 --> 00:24:24.260
and especially if we were coming everything would
be lit.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.748
TRAVIS: I agree, cause for concern.

00:24:27.748 --> 00:24:31.107
LAURA: I think we should enter the castle warily.
Off of the horses.

00:24:31.107 --> 00:24:33.982
SAM: You guys are a bunch of namby-pambies.

00:24:33.982 --> 00:24:36.178
LAURA: You want to ride in there, Benny?

00:24:36.178 --> 00:24:39.734
SAM: Well I mean, I'm not going to-- it's dark.

00:24:39.734 --> 00:24:41.351
ERICA: I will produce a flame.

00:24:41.351 --> 00:24:44.728
SAM: All right then, I'll--

00:24:44.728 --> 00:24:47.617
LIAM: You're doing it, you're doing it!

00:24:47.617 --> 00:24:50.639
TRAVIS: You're doing it, Peter!

00:24:50.639 --> 00:24:53.133
LAURA: Oh my god, there's a flame in your hand
right now!

00:24:53.133 --> 00:24:56.130
SAM: You want to come in the front way with me?

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.403
ERICA: Of course.

00:24:57.403 --> 00:25:03.983
LAURA: The castle's overrun, you're just going to
get attacked? Do you think there's not a good

00:25:03.983 --> 00:25:05.652
reason all the flames are out?

00:25:05.652 --> 00:25:08.080
TRAVIS: Caution may be the wiser choice here,
brother.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.518
SAM: (sighs) Fine.

00:25:09.518 --> 00:25:11.310
ERICA: I will put it out.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.616
LAURA: Is there a side entrance? There's a side
entrance; we all know about it.

00:25:15.616 --> 00:25:19.557
LIAM: There are multiple entrances to the castle.
There's one at the back. There's one on each side,

00:25:19.557 --> 00:25:20.340
in fact.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.572
LAURA: (whispering) The side entrance.

00:25:22.572 --> 00:25:25.719
SAM: All right, we're all going in the side
entrance, then?

00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:29.002
TJ: Which way did we sneak in and out of the
castle as children?

00:25:29.002 --> 00:25:37.335
LIAM: On the back side of the castle, facing
towards the woods, and the family cemetery

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:39.860
grounds, and the fields you played in.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.215
TJ: Aurra, do you remember the way that we used to
sneak in through the back?

00:25:43.215 --> 00:25:44.216
ERICA: I do, brother.

00:25:44.216 --> 00:25:46.457
TJ: Perhaps this is a wise way to enter.

00:25:46.457 --> 00:25:51.468
LAURA: It's a pretty small tunnel. Benny,
you might not fit now; you're so big.

00:25:51.468 --> 00:25:53.887
SAM: I'll make some space.

00:25:53.887 --> 00:26:00.711
TRAVIS: Yay, more going through the woods. My
favorite. Let's go.

00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:05.504
LIAM: You guys loop around in the dark.

00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:07.117
TJ: Leave the horses behind.

00:26:07.117 --> 00:26:09.360
LAURA: Stealthily. We'll do it quietly so no one
notices us.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:16.474
TRAVIS: We kill the horses before we-- (laughing,
snarling). Not yet? Not yet.

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:18.197
SAM: Not yet. Wait for it.

00:26:18.197 --> 00:26:22.555
LAURA: Don't let him transform the whole game.
Make sure you never let him transform.

00:26:22.555 --> 00:26:23.272
LIAM: Okay.

00:26:23.272 --> 00:26:27.922
TRAVIS: I wait. I tie mine to a tree, though, so I
know where my snack is.

00:26:27.922 --> 00:26:36.178
LIAM: You guys do, in the dark, make your way
around. Do you want to leave the lanterns lit, or

00:26:36.178 --> 00:26:37.932
are we going to go in total--

00:26:37.932 --> 00:26:39.750
LAURA: How good is our vision?

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:44.962
TRAVIS: Well, these two people are quite familiar
with the woods and that of nature. I would not

00:26:44.962 --> 00:26:46.718
mind letting them go first.

00:26:46.718 --> 00:26:51.287
LIAM: The woods are a half mile out from the back
of the keep.

00:26:51.287 --> 00:26:55.807
TJ: Our lanterns are hooded. We can control the
light. We proceed carefully.

00:26:55.807 --> 00:26:57.618
LIAM: Everybody make a stealth check.

00:26:57.618 --> 00:26:59.304
TRAVIS: Ooh! First roll!

00:27:03.004 --> 00:27:05.360
SAM: Wrong one. You want to roll the big one.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:13.532
ERICA: Holding the big one. Thank you for moving
those, appreciate it. Wait, what am I tracking?

00:27:13.532 --> 00:27:20.446
Stealth, thank you. Oh, that is bad. That's real
bad. I'm going to go with a five. I'm a five.

00:27:20.446 --> 00:27:22.710
LIAM: Great. What'd everybody get?

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.564
TRAVIS: 13.

00:27:23.564 --> 00:27:24.534
SAM: 21.

00:27:24.534 --> 00:27:26.767
LAURA: 14.

00:27:26.767 --> 00:27:29.049
TJ: I seem to have tripped.

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:31.931
LAURA: Did you get a one?

00:27:31.931 --> 00:27:32.778
LIAM: Did you?

00:27:32.778 --> 00:27:33.593
TJ: Six.

00:27:33.593 --> 00:27:43.237
LIAM: Oh, six. Okay. You guys are traveling along
the outer wall and Lucius is trailing behind, and

00:27:43.533 --> 00:27:46.764
you do hear metal scraping against stone for a
split second.

00:27:46.764 --> 00:27:47.893
TRAVIS: What is that?!

00:27:47.893 --> 00:27:49.935
TJ: I'm fine. Nothing.

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:53.112
TRAVIS: Is that a belt? What is it? How much metal
do you have on you?

00:27:53.112 --> 00:27:55.073
TJ: It's the lantern. I dropped it.

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:57.693
ERICA: It's all right. You found our way.

00:27:57.693 --> 00:28:03.483
SAM: Do you need to make some sort of prayer or
something before we go in there?

00:28:03.483 --> 00:28:06.028
TJ: The Moonweaver guides me.

00:28:06.028 --> 00:28:14.513
SAM: Could you tell her to guide you a little
better? Burn some incense, man, come on. Let's go.

00:28:16.367 --> 00:28:21.914
LIAM: Arguing, you eventually make it around back,
and you do find the one single small door that is

00:28:21.914 --> 00:28:28.346
on the back side of the keep. It also can be fired
at from above, but no one's doing that. It is also

00:28:28.346 --> 00:28:29.890
barred from the inside.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.412
TRAVIS: Barred from the inside?

00:28:31.412 --> 00:28:34.060
LIAM: You'd know, because you live here,
obviously.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.863
TRAVIS: Right. Are there any signs of struggle or
debris, arrows, staffs?

00:28:38.863 --> 00:28:42.795
LIAM: Make an investigation check. Look at that.
It's that easy. You just make it up.

00:28:42.795 --> 00:28:44.071
TRAVIS: 14.

00:28:44.071 --> 00:28:52.972
LIAM: No, nothing seems amiss. It is dark, maybe
you're missing something, but it looks like the

00:28:52.972 --> 00:28:58.414
same old door in the same spot that you would run
out in the middle of the night.

00:28:58.414 --> 00:29:02.603
TRAVIS: No signs of struggle. Strange they
wouldn't be anticipating our arrival.

00:29:02.603 --> 00:29:07.950
SAM: Because there's no one here. You guys are
freaking out over nothing. They turned off the lights.

00:29:08.432 --> 00:29:09.288
ERICA: Then who barred the door?

00:29:09.288 --> 00:29:11.558
TRAVIS: Exactly. How many times has no one been
here?

00:29:11.558 --> 00:29:20.325
TJ: Our father has invited us, the entire family,
yes? When has he ever missed an opportunity to

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:27.305
hold a social gathering without all the frills?
This place should be lit and filled with cooks and

00:29:27.305 --> 00:29:32.195
bakers and smells of love, and yet it is cold.

00:29:32.195 --> 00:29:36.273
LAURA: Smells of love, you heard him. Smells of
love!

00:29:36.273 --> 00:29:38.517
SAM: Yeah, yeah, he always had the nice,
flowery--

00:29:38.517 --> 00:29:39.833
ERICA: Should I produce a flame again?

00:29:39.833 --> 00:29:45.347
SAM: If you must. We can't get into this tunnel
we've gone in our whole lives?

00:29:45.347 --> 00:29:52.012
LIAM: You'd opened it from the inside and leave
it. That's what you've always done, is left a crack.

00:29:52.553 --> 00:29:53.688
SAM: Oh, it's locked.

00:29:53.688 --> 00:29:57.787
LIAM: Yeah, it's not a (squeaking), it's a
(thudding).

00:29:57.787 --> 00:30:01.147
LAURA: How old is the door? Can we bust through
the bottom part of the wood or something?

00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:02.656
LIAM: You can certainly try.

00:30:02.656 --> 00:30:03.491
LAURA: Should I try?

00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:04.997
TRAVIS: Are you strong?

00:30:04.997 --> 00:30:07.386
LAURA: I am so fucking strong.

00:30:07.386 --> 00:30:08.771
LIAM: You are pretty strong.

00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:13.045
LAURA: I'm going to try it. I'm going to try and
just-- through the bottom.

00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:16.754
TRAVIS: I'll help you. You get advantage, if the
DM allows it.

00:30:16.754 --> 00:30:20.824
LAURA: If you want me to have advantage. Do you
want me to have advantage because he's helping me?

00:30:22.368 --> 00:30:23.905
LIAM: How are you doing this?

00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:25.372
LAURA: Is it a wooden door?

00:30:25.372 --> 00:30:27.814
LIAM: Yes, it is. Heavy wooden door.

00:30:27.814 --> 00:30:29.240
TRAVIS: Heel kick that shit.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.236
LAURA: Yeah, at the bottom. I'm going to aim below
where the barricade is, I'm going to try to make a

00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:35.841
tunnel at the bottom of it, you know what I mean?

00:30:35.841 --> 00:30:38.175
ERICA: Are you aiming for a specific location?

00:30:38.175 --> 00:30:39.507
LAURA: The bottom center, where it's the weakest.

00:30:39.507 --> 00:30:41.143
ERICA: Should I illuminate your effort?

00:30:41.143 --> 00:30:45.553
LAURA: Do I see a weak spot where the wood-- I
mean, it's pretty old. There's a tunnel. Is there

00:30:45.553 --> 00:30:47.289
rotted wood anywhere?

00:30:47.289 --> 00:30:50.392
LIAM: One slat is a little mangier than the
others.

00:30:50.392 --> 00:30:51.591
LAURA: I want to aim for that.

00:30:51.591 --> 00:30:55.595
LIAM: You can have advantage because your brother
and sister offered to kick that shit with you.

00:30:55.595 --> 00:30:59.738
TJ: I give her a prayer of Guidance without her
knowledge, to the Moonweaver, of course. D4.

00:30:59.738 --> 00:31:03.955
TRAVIS: (singing) Ooh, Moonweaver!

00:31:03.955 --> 00:31:07.045
SAM: What are you doing over there? You praying?
What are you doing over there? What is that?

00:31:07.045 --> 00:31:08.818
TJ: The Moonweaver will see us through.

00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:26.543
LAURA: Jesus H. It's fine. What do I do, add my
strength modifier? 20. Wait, 11 plus seven. 18.

00:31:26.543 --> 00:31:36.660
LIAM: You do slam your foot as hard as you can
into that door and it does break. It pushes in

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:46.565
about this far and it is dark in there, but there
is now about this wide a gap. So if you can shrink

00:31:46.565 --> 00:31:47.397
a lot...

00:31:47.397 --> 00:31:49.457
LAURA: All of the rest of the slats. Just really
try to--

00:31:49.457 --> 00:31:50.907
TRAVIS: How does it smell?

00:31:50.907 --> 00:31:57.395
LIAM: It actually smells terrible. It smells
nauseating.

00:31:57.395 --> 00:31:59.373
LAURA: Does it smell sweet? Does it smell like
death?

00:31:59.373 --> 00:32:00.013
LIAM: Yes.

00:32:00.013 --> 00:32:01.345
SAM: Like death?

00:32:01.345 --> 00:32:03.083
LAURA: It smells like death in there.

00:32:03.083 --> 00:32:11.815
LIAM: You do smell the smell of a heavily ripe,
rotting body.

00:32:11.815 --> 00:32:13.129
LAURA: Really try to bust through.

00:32:13.129 --> 00:32:16.086
SAM: It's probably just a rat or something. You
know, those ran down here all the time.

00:32:16.086 --> 00:32:21.283
LIAM: Also, Lucius, you know where you are. This
room-- which used to be a meeting hall-- when you

00:32:21.283 --> 00:32:27.342
were inducted into the temple of the Moonweaver,
your father, as a gift to you, had it altered and

00:32:27.342 --> 00:32:31.799
turned into a chapel in honor of the Moonweaver
for whenever you visited.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:35.370
TJ: We need to get inside.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.118
LAURA: Will you stick your flame hand through the
door?

00:32:39.118 --> 00:32:40.934
ERICA: Of course.

00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:43.223
LAURA: What can we see? Does it look like a lot of
bodies in there?

00:32:43.223 --> 00:32:48.009
LIAM: You can see about six feet in, from the
angle that the wood is in. It's still blocking

00:32:48.009 --> 00:32:57.535
your way and you can't get your noggin through
that gap, but you do see two legs and an arm and a

00:32:57.535 --> 00:33:02.121
stone with congealed blood on the ground.

00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:04.111
LAURA: Two legs and an arm of the same body?

00:33:04.111 --> 00:33:06.728
LIAM: No, they look like three separate bodies.

00:33:06.728 --> 00:33:11.543
TRAVIS: I was going to ask if the limbs were
attached to anything, but I take it they're all separate?

00:33:12.161 --> 00:33:16.346
LIAM: You see up to a shoulder on one and the
other one you just see the ends.

00:33:16.346 --> 00:33:24.902
SAM: All right, I'm still not a hundred percent
sure that this isn't some crazy surprise party or something.

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:26.011
TRAVIS: Really?

00:33:26.011 --> 00:33:27.187
ERICA: Benicio.

00:33:27.187 --> 00:33:29.257
SAM: I don't know, maybe I was wrong.

00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:30.644
ERICA: Do you smell that?

00:33:30.644 --> 00:33:32.563
SAM: Yeah, that could be hors d'oeuvres.

00:33:32.563 --> 00:33:34.719
TJ: We need to get inside.

00:33:34.719 --> 00:33:36.286
SAM: How? Thoughts?

00:33:36.286 --> 00:33:38.704
TJ: Break this the rest of the way. Do what you
need to do.

00:33:38.704 --> 00:33:41.806
SAM: I'll take it. Give me a crack.

00:33:41.806 --> 00:33:43.225
TJ: Guidance.

00:33:43.225 --> 00:33:45.007
LIAM: Excellent.

00:33:45.007 --> 00:33:48.939
SAM: (growls) I'll take my glaive and--
(grunting).

00:33:48.939 --> 00:33:51.182
LIAM: Okay, make an attack roll on that door.

00:33:51.182 --> 00:33:53.398
TRAVIS: Can you do it while be electrocuted and on
fire?

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:55.386
LIAM: Did you roll higher than a five?

00:33:55.386 --> 00:33:56.200
SAM: 21.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.423
LIAM: You hit it. Roll for damage.

00:34:00.423 --> 00:34:04.878
TRAVIS: These doors don't fuck with the Loreleis!

00:34:04.878 --> 00:34:07.933
SAM: 11 points of damage.

00:34:07.933 --> 00:34:15.935
LIAM: Oh, man, the door breaks one hinge, busts
inward. You now have a one foot view. It's still

00:34:15.935 --> 00:34:22.661
connected at one hinge and didn't come off. It
would be hard to climb up and over into the gap,

00:34:22.661 --> 00:34:31.116
but you're looking in. It's a pile of bodies. It's
about 15 bodies piled in the middle of a chapel

00:34:31.116 --> 00:34:33.945
devoted to the Moonweaver.

00:34:33.945 --> 00:34:35.535
SAM: Going to need some light in here.

00:34:35.535 --> 00:34:39.948
TRAVIS: Normally the castle is approximately how
many stories? Is this an underground level?

00:34:39.948 --> 00:34:46.083
LIAM: This is ground level. There is an
underground level, and it is three stories.

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:48.093
TRAVIS: Three stories, got it. We're on ground
level.

00:34:48.093 --> 00:34:49.823
LAURA: Do we recognize any of the bodies?

00:34:49.823 --> 00:35:00.160
LIAM: Yes, you do. You see one of the cooks, a
woman named Estelle. You see the stable master and

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.429
his eight year old son. You see two of the guards.
The others you don't recognize, per se.

00:35:05.429 --> 00:35:06.983
ERICA: I will illuminate the room.

00:35:06.983 --> 00:35:09.889
LAURA: Look for Father.

00:35:09.889 --> 00:35:12.393
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

00:35:12.393 --> 00:35:13.072
TRAVIS: No.

00:35:13.072 --> 00:35:22.887
SAM: Can I look at some of the bodies and see if I
can discern the method of death? Be it burning or

00:35:23.566 --> 00:35:24.496
slashing or strangling.

00:35:24.496 --> 00:35:30.595
LIAM: Absolutely. Perception check. The door has
not been broken free, so you can look in. It's

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:35.014
hanging on a diagonal angle. It probably wouldn't
take much more to take it away.

00:35:35.014 --> 00:35:36.715
SAM: 14 to look in.

00:35:36.715 --> 00:35:39.700
LIAM: They are all slashed to shit.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.959
LAURA: 14, for finding Dad, too.

00:35:41.959 --> 00:35:45.042
LIAM: 14 for finding Dad. You do not see your
father.

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.371
TRAVIS: We're still outside.

00:35:46.371 --> 00:35:47.799
LAURA: I'm going to shoulder--

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.927
TRAVIS: Just a moment. In case someone was
anticipating us arriving, there could be a trap.

00:35:53.927 --> 00:36:00.316
TJ: I grab two rocks and I pray for Light, and I
throw them into the room at different angles so I

00:36:00.316 --> 00:36:04.276
can see inside. Is there anything moving?

00:36:04.276 --> 00:36:10.150
LIAM: No, nothing is moving, and the door on the
far side of the chapel, which leads into the

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:18.689
courtyard inside the castle walls, is closed. You
have very much illuminated the wretched pile of

00:36:18.689 --> 00:36:26.528
lost souls in the center. Pews have been pushed to
the side and they're in a heap, in a mound, in the

00:36:26.528 --> 00:36:27.467
middle of the room.

00:36:27.467 --> 00:36:29.219
TJ: Break it down. We need to get in.

00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:36.298
SAM: All right. (grunting) Punch the door.

00:36:36.298 --> 00:36:38.389
LIAM: I will say that door comes right off the
hinges.

00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:39.594
SAM: Even though I rolled a two.

00:36:39.594 --> 00:36:41.980
LAURA: To hit it? You rolled a two to hit it?

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:48.045
SAM: I did. It's plus six, so that's eight?

00:36:48.045 --> 00:36:52.439
LIAM: In that case, the door comes right off the
hinges, clatters down onto the ground, and you're

00:36:52.439 --> 00:36:53.907
now standing on top of it.

00:36:53.907 --> 00:37:00.550
TJ: I rush in. I see if there's anyone that I can
help, anyone who's still alive.

00:37:01.045 --> 00:37:02.505
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

00:37:02.505 --> 00:37:05.303
LAURA: Ooh, he's got a tower!

00:37:05.303 --> 00:37:08.540
LIAM: He's been playing for 30 years.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.621
SAM: How come none of us ever used a tower in this
game?

00:37:11.621 --> 00:37:14.025
LAURA: I don't know, but it looks so cool. Now I
want one.

00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:14.915
TJ: 18.

00:37:14.915 --> 00:37:18.048
LIAM: What did I just say, perception?

00:37:18.048 --> 00:37:20.955
TJ: Investigation. My perception is way better.

00:37:20.955 --> 00:37:29.632
LIAM: They seem like they have been dead a while.
In fact, follow that up with a medicine check.

00:37:36.582 --> 00:37:37.538
TJ: 15.

00:37:37.538 --> 00:37:47.442
LIAM: You bend down by the body of the cook-- a
woman who has cooked many meals for you-- and you

00:37:47.615 --> 00:37:55.423
check the body and study the blood on the ground
and how hard it is, and you can tell that it has

00:37:55.423 --> 00:38:03.156
been somewhere between-- I don't know. Two weeks,
a month, maybe? These bodies have been here a while.

00:38:03.156 --> 00:38:04.714
TJ: Is my father in here?

00:38:04.714 --> 00:38:13.441
LIAM: No, he's not. You push over a few bodies,
you spend five minutes sorting through the dead,

00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:14.835
and they're all--

00:38:14.835 --> 00:38:18.738
TJ: These are dead and although they brought us
up, we must find our father.

00:38:18.738 --> 00:38:22.305
LAURA: Did you say how long they've been here?

00:38:22.305 --> 00:38:27.826
TJ: Days, longer perhaps. I start to go upstairs
to where he would be?

00:38:27.826 --> 00:38:36.707
LIAM: There's no upstairs here. Within the wall
are rooms on the ground level. There is this

00:38:36.707 --> 00:38:41.531
chapel, there's a great meeting hall where your
father receives people, there are the kitchens,

00:38:41.531 --> 00:38:48.633
there are the stables. The courtyard is huge and
the entire thing is empty in the middle. It's

00:38:48.633 --> 00:38:54.569
where you've trained and where you've played. You
would get there by exiting the door on the

00:38:54.569 --> 00:38:55.798
opposite side of the room.

00:38:55.798 --> 00:39:00.139
TRAVIS: Someone will pay for this, but can we
please-- (gagging) open the other door.

00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:01.488
SAM: Are you going to barf?

00:39:01.488 --> 00:39:03.706
TRAVIS: No. I'm not. I have allergies.

00:39:03.706 --> 00:39:07.935
SAM: You sure? Because there's blood and guts and
brain all over the place.

00:39:07.935 --> 00:39:15.187
LIAM: I should add, it's only the towers of the
castle, for the watch, and the central keep that

00:39:15.187 --> 00:39:17.707
is three stories tall. The rest of it is low
buildings.

00:39:17.707 --> 00:39:21.143
TJ: Are there any shields or armaments on the
walls?

00:39:21.143 --> 00:39:26.081
LIAM: In here? There is only a single shield.

00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:27.101
TJ: I grab it.

00:39:27.101 --> 00:39:33.568
LIAM: Okay. It has the two arrows with the
crescent moon in the middle that is symbol of the

00:39:33.568 --> 00:39:34.847
Moonweaver upon it.

00:39:34.847 --> 00:39:39.564
TJ: I was too small to wield this when I was a
child, but now I will show my father different.

00:39:39.564 --> 00:39:41.327
And I grab it and I leave.

00:39:41.327 --> 00:39:45.936
LIAM: Okay. Lucius pushes past you all, opens the
door.

00:39:45.936 --> 00:39:48.982
LAURA: Wait, Lucius, arm yourself! Everyone, arm
yourself.

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:57.574
LIAM: Lucius, by the dim light of the rocks that you
illuminated in the chapel, you can see a little

00:39:57.574 --> 00:40:04.657
bit out here. The first thing you see walking into
the courtyard: it is mostly empty. What you can

00:40:04.657 --> 00:40:09.997
see is a pile of weapons in the center of the
courtyard, piled up. There seems to be a cart on

00:40:09.997 --> 00:40:12.726
the far end, but it's very dark, so you can't make
much of it.

00:40:12.726 --> 00:40:13.600
TJ: Light.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:23.576
LIAM: Okay. It's still a ways off. It's about 100,
150 feet away, but there is a cart full of

00:40:23.841 --> 00:40:29.895
vegetables, half unloaded. You can't tell quite
what they are from here.

00:40:29.895 --> 00:40:34.570
TJ: I yell to the others what I see on the inside.
And I wait.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.520
SAM: Don't go any further. Wait until we come up
with some kind of plan or something, man.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.502
TRAVIS: It's a cart full of vegetables. What kind
of plan do you need?

00:40:41.502 --> 00:40:44.571
TJ: Our father might be in danger. We must move
quickly.

00:40:44.571 --> 00:40:48.449
LAURA: Does it look like the bodies were dragged
into the temple, or does it look like they were

00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:49.553
murdered inside the temple?

00:40:49.553 --> 00:40:50.888
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

00:40:50.888 --> 00:40:53.249
TRAVIS: Ooh, good question.

00:40:53.249 --> 00:40:55.986
LAURA: 15.

00:40:55.986 --> 00:41:03.106
LIAM: There is the residue and trails of blood
leading from the courtyard. You can't see it in

00:41:03.106 --> 00:41:08.007
the mud in the courtyard, because it's raining so
heavily. I'll add that it's still raining. Is it

00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:08.914
still raining?

00:41:08.914 --> 00:41:09.748
TRAVIS: Yeah, I hear it.

00:41:09.748 --> 00:41:16.248
LIAM: You do? I can't tell from here. On the
threshold leading in, you see trails of blood that

00:41:16.248 --> 00:41:19.096
are getting washed away by the torrential
downpour.

00:41:19.096 --> 00:41:20.453
LAURA: The rain, <i>of course</i>, gets rid of the
tracks.

00:41:20.453 --> 00:41:28.104
TRAVIS: Do we care to visit the pile of weapons?
Everyone have what they need? In case, you know,

00:41:28.104 --> 00:41:29.853
someone needs to be dealt with.

00:41:29.853 --> 00:41:34.350
SAM: I brought one with me. If you guys need to
stock up, I'll watch your backs.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:39.096
TRAVIS: I'm good. I pull out two shortswords from
my back harness underneath my jacket.

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:40.317
LIAM: Excellent.

00:41:40.317 --> 00:41:42.046
ERICA: I think I smell Father.

00:41:42.046 --> 00:41:46.459
SAM: Do the woodland creatures tell you where he
is?

00:41:46.459 --> 00:41:52.060
ERICA: No. I've spent many years in the woods. My
senses are far more highly attuned than yours.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.418
SAM: All right, I get it. You don't like that I
don't have a career.

00:41:55.418 --> 00:41:58.112
ERICA: Is that what I'm saying?

00:41:58.112 --> 00:42:03.824
SAM: I don't know. You're always ragging on me to
finish school and make something of myself.

00:42:03.824 --> 00:42:05.941
ERICA: Benicio, I am simply speaking of your
wolf--

00:42:05.941 --> 00:42:07.246
SAM: I get it.

00:42:07.246 --> 00:42:10.601
TRAVIS: I wonder if maybe this is not the time to
bring up old shit?

00:42:10.601 --> 00:42:13.032
SAM: I just don't want to be a craftsman.

00:42:13.032 --> 00:42:15.533
ERICA: I smell Father. Is that not important to
you?

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:17.442
SAM: Yes, it is. Let's go.

00:42:17.442 --> 00:42:18.935
LAURA: Where do you smell him?

00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:21.061
ERICA: Coming from that direction.

00:42:21.061 --> 00:42:26.149
LIAM: From your vantage point-- to help you see
the thing you've known all your life-- you're

00:42:26.149 --> 00:42:31.487
standing with the chapel at your back and on your
right is the keep, your home. Your old bedrooms

00:42:31.487 --> 00:42:39.889
are in the keep. Your father's bedroom, his study,
your aunt Katerine's bedroom. You also to your

00:42:39.889 --> 00:42:45.075
right have the great hall. There are smaller
one-story buildings that line the inside of the

00:42:45.075 --> 00:42:51.130
castle.There are the kitchens. You can see the
open gate now, because you've lit the courtyard so

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:55.469
well, even though it's further off. You can see
the open gate where you were standing 30 minutes

00:42:55.469 --> 00:43:02.595
earlier, and that cart. You've been standing here
taking it in long enough, you notice there are

00:43:02.595 --> 00:43:05.474
also two people on that cart. They're not moving.

00:43:05.474 --> 00:43:06.534
SAM: Dead or alive?

00:43:06.534 --> 00:43:08.062
LIAM: Well, they're not moving.

00:43:08.062 --> 00:43:09.373
TJ: I run to it.

00:43:09.373 --> 00:43:10.538
TRAVIS: I'll join him.

00:43:10.538 --> 00:43:17.008
TJ: If there is an obvious weapon that I can wield
in the pile as I pass it-- if I pass it.

00:43:17.008 --> 00:43:24.162
LIAM: There are many. There's probably somewhere
between 40 to 50 weapons here. There are blades,

00:43:24.162 --> 00:43:27.187
there are mauls, there is a mace or two.

00:43:27.187 --> 00:43:31.090
TJ: I'll pick up a mace and I'll run to the cart
on the way.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:38.439
LIAM: I will say, also as you're running in, you
look at it. This mace looks old. As you run up to

00:43:38.439 --> 00:43:46.108
the cart, you see instant recognition from your
youth, from your teen years. One of the farmers

00:43:46.108 --> 00:43:54.975
that tills the land on Castle Lorelei's grounds is
shot full of crossbow bolts, as is his 15-year-old

00:43:54.975 --> 00:44:05.081
son. They're leaning against each other. It's a
cart full of turnips, apples, some cabbage. It

00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:10.665
looks like someone has started to unload it.
Although, it does not look like it pulled up. It

00:44:10.665 --> 00:44:13.345
looks helter-skelter.

00:44:13.345 --> 00:44:17.099
TJ: They're long dead?

00:44:17.099 --> 00:44:20.234
LIAM: Make a medicine check.

00:44:20.234 --> 00:44:23.912
TJ: 11.

00:44:23.912 --> 00:44:35.853
LIAM: Yeah. Maybe it's the rain that has been
pouring on them all day long, but there's not as

00:44:35.853 --> 00:44:40.522
much to go on as the bodies indoors. They
definitely weren't killed today.

00:44:40.522 --> 00:44:47.519
LAURA: These were innocents. These were our
people. We were suppose to protect them. This is

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:49.341
an act of war.

00:44:49.341 --> 00:44:51.179
ERICA: This is an act of civilization.

00:44:51.179 --> 00:44:56.193
TJ: This is our act to choose. If we cannot find
our father. We must find him.

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:59.531
SAM: Where are the living quarters?

00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:06.687
LIAM: The keep. The largest structure in this
castle. There are stairs that lead up to a large

00:45:06.687 --> 00:45:09.162
ornate set of doors into your home.

00:45:09.162 --> 00:45:11.449
SAM: Any light or signs of life up there?

00:45:11.449 --> 00:45:13.233
LIAM: The doors are shut.

00:45:13.233 --> 00:45:16.826
TRAVIS: Aurra, is that where you smelled Father
coming from?

00:45:16.826 --> 00:45:17.966
ERICA: It's from that direction.

00:45:17.966 --> 00:45:20.044
TRAVIS: Then let's make haste, shall we?

00:45:20.044 --> 00:45:26.777
TJ: Are there any foreign carts, horses, travel
devices at all in this court?

00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:32.384
SAM: Or any carts that aren't usually garaged
here?

00:45:32.384 --> 00:45:36.271
LIAM: Good question. You don't see anything like
that, and there's certainly no living animal or

00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:39.145
living being in here.

00:45:39.145 --> 00:45:42.994
LAURA: Definitely keeping an eye out for any
movement, anything that catches our eye.

00:45:42.994 --> 00:45:43.895
LIAM: Noted.

00:45:43.895 --> 00:45:47.466
TRAVIS: We head towards the gates of the keep.

00:45:47.466 --> 00:45:49.711
LIAM: Okay. Who's leading the way?

00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:52.033
ERICA: I am.

00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:53.769
LAURA: Aurra, she's the oldest.

00:45:53.769 --> 00:45:56.070
SAM: I better stay right behind you.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.530
ERICA: Why is that?

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.341
SAM: There's no animals to protect you. You need a
real weapon or something.

00:46:01.341 --> 00:46:03.935
TRAVIS: Are you a real weapon?

00:46:03.935 --> 00:46:06.526
SAM: Yeah. License to kill, man.

00:46:06.526 --> 00:46:08.570
ERICA: I appreciate your kindness, brother.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:14.437
LIAM: You ascend the stairs towards the doors to
the keep. Do you mean to just push in?

00:46:14.437 --> 00:46:23.500
ERICA: I feel like we need to be cautious. Do you
hear anything on the other side?

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:30.468
TJ: I pray for Guidance and listen to the door.

00:46:30.468 --> 00:46:31.581
LIAM: Sure.

00:46:31.581 --> 00:46:41.494
TJ: Perception of 29.

00:46:41.494 --> 00:46:44.715
LIAM: Fuck!

00:46:44.715 --> 00:46:48.244
TRAVIS: You hear the termites in the wood.

00:46:48.244 --> 00:46:56.325
LIAM: Lucius presses his ear to the door and his
free hand to his other ear to block out the sound

00:46:56.325 --> 00:47:05.059
of the rain, shuts his eyes and listens for a full
30 seconds. It takes you a moment to cancel out

00:47:05.059 --> 00:47:12.445
the sound of the rain drumming, but you do it, and
you hear absolutely nothing.

00:47:12.445 --> 00:47:13.866
TJ: There is nothing.

00:47:13.866 --> 00:47:17.496
TRAVIS: Nothing at all? No sounds? No creaks?

00:47:17.496 --> 00:47:24.865
SAM: All right. They could be waiting for us.
Still be cautious, and we'll go in. You want me to

00:47:24.865 --> 00:47:26.066
go first, or you?

00:47:26.066 --> 00:47:29.121
ERICA: I need you to jimmy the door for me.

00:47:29.121 --> 00:47:32.364
SAM: All right. (grunting)

00:47:32.364 --> 00:47:37.207
LIAM: It swings open. It's big. You hit it and it
goes (creaking).

00:47:37.207 --> 00:47:38.272
TRAVIS: Nice job, human weapon.

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:48.438
LIAM: In here, in the great hall, it's not much,
but there clearly has been a fire in the hearth

00:47:48.438 --> 00:47:55.511
here that is burning down to embers. There is dim
light in the grand entryway to your keep. To your

00:47:55.511 --> 00:48:04.434
home. The first thing that strikes you is a small
wooden table and three chairs pulled into the

00:48:04.434 --> 00:48:12.743
center of the room. There is a smattering of
playing cards thrown out across the table.

00:48:12.743 --> 00:48:14.518
SAM: Dad?

00:48:14.518 --> 00:48:21.685
LAURA: I walk up the table and swipe up the
playing cards. Try to sniff them. See if I smell

00:48:21.685 --> 00:48:23.443
anybody that we recognize.

00:48:23.443 --> 00:48:29.796
LIAM: Make an investigation check at
disadvantage.

00:48:29.796 --> 00:48:31.781
TJ: Guidance.

00:48:33.387 --> 00:48:35.041
SAM: How many times can you do this Guidance
thing?

00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:37.809
LAURA: Damn it. I got a 19 and a fucking one!

00:48:42.359 --> 00:48:48.495
LIAM: Nope! You have got the reek of death in your
nostrils right now and you can't smell anything

00:48:48.853 --> 00:48:50.891
else. It's a wonder you can hold your breakfast
in.

00:48:50.891 --> 00:48:54.366
SAM: I'm going to run to his closet. This is Dad's
room?

00:48:54.366 --> 00:49:02.591
LIAM: No. Grand entry hall. Your rooms, the twins'
joint room, your room, your room, your room are

00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:07.794
all upstairs. Your Aunt Kat's room is upstairs.
Your father's room, your father's study is upstairs.

00:49:07.827 --> 00:49:15.324
SAM: We've got to go upstairs. You want to be the
tip of the spear this time, Larry?

00:49:16.092 --> 00:49:18.241
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm the tip of the spear, you're the
human weapon?

00:49:18.241 --> 00:49:19.350
TJ: I'm walking up the stairs.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:25.144
LAURA: I look around the room. Is there any tracks
in the room? Anybody that looks like they might

00:49:25.144 --> 00:49:26.960
still be hiding in the room?

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.384
LIAM: Oh. Yeah, okay. Make a perception check.

00:49:29.384 --> 00:49:35.559
TRAVIS: While she's doing that, can I ask Aurra if
she smells Father in any particular direction?

00:49:35.559 --> 00:49:36.128
LAURA: 12.

00:49:36.128 --> 00:49:37.975
ERICA: I'm sensing sarcasm from you, brother.

00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.823
TRAVIS: I was being genuine!

00:49:39.823 --> 00:49:50.647
LIAM: There is a very nice carpet under that table
and in front of that fire. You do see wet prints pressed.

00:49:51.463 --> 00:49:53.190
LAURA: Wet prints!

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.819
TRAVIS: What does that mean? What?

00:49:54.819 --> 00:50:03.044
LIAM: Lucius is ascending the stairs. Would you
make a perception check at advantage?

00:50:03.044 --> 00:50:08.564
LAURA: It means whoever was here was here during
the rain. Which means they're probably still in

00:50:08.867 --> 00:50:09.437
the building.

00:50:09.437 --> 00:50:10.413
LIAM: Is that a 20?

00:50:10.413 --> 00:50:13.167
ERICA, SAM, and LAURA: Yes.

00:50:13.167 --> 00:50:14.124
ERICA: 27.

00:50:14.124 --> 00:50:24.017
LIAM: You honestly do smell your father. It's not
strange for any of you, but especially you. You

00:50:24.017 --> 00:50:31.492
spend so much time in the woods, not in your human
form. And that smell is coming from upstairs.

00:50:31.492 --> 00:50:36.768
ERICA: We must proceed upstairs. The smell is
getting stronger.

00:50:36.768 --> 00:50:39.817
SAM: I mean, he lives here. Of course you're going
to smell him here.

00:50:39.817 --> 00:50:41.646
ERICA: Benicio, for christ's sake.

00:50:41.646 --> 00:50:42.994
TJ: Did you say there's a print?

00:50:42.994 --> 00:50:44.654
TRAVIS: Yes. Fresh print from the rain.

00:50:44.654 --> 00:50:45.519
TJ: Human?

00:50:45.519 --> 00:50:47.188
LAURA: Human boots.

00:50:47.188 --> 00:50:51.582
TJ: I look up the stairs. I listen as well.

00:50:51.582 --> 00:50:54.496
LIAM: Sure. Make a new perception check.

00:50:54.496 --> 00:50:56.229
TJ: I pray as I do it.

00:50:56.229 --> 00:50:59.111
LIAM: Does Jester have Guidance?

00:50:59.111 --> 00:51:02.126
LAURA: I don't think so, no.

00:51:02.126 --> 00:51:03.959
LIAM: What was it?

00:51:03.959 --> 00:51:04.706
TJ: 21.

00:51:04.706 --> 00:51:09.118
LAURA: Oh, wait. Is that a cantrip? Motherfuck.

00:51:09.118 --> 00:51:18.525
LIAM: You listen. You close your eyes and listen.
You're a big listener. Silence.

00:51:18.525 --> 00:51:23.477
LAURA: It's really a cantrip?

00:51:23.477 --> 00:51:25.378
TRAVIS: Okay. Come on.

00:51:25.378 --> 00:51:27.707
SAM: That would involve you helping other people,
though.

00:51:27.707 --> 00:51:29.725
TRAVIS: Father is upstairs. Let's hurry!

00:51:29.725 --> 00:51:32.637
ERICA: We must proceed. I smell him.

00:51:32.637 --> 00:51:35.563
TRAVIS: Lucius, hurry.

00:51:35.563 --> 00:51:36.841
SAM: What, him?

00:51:36.841 --> 00:51:39.352
TRAVIS: Yes. He's got a shield!

00:51:39.352 --> 00:51:43.862
LAURA: He's noisy! You're really noisy, Lucius.

00:51:43.862 --> 00:51:46.057
SAM: Let me go first.

00:51:46.057 --> 00:51:47.127
LAURA: Why?

00:51:47.127 --> 00:51:48.506
TJ: I move out of the way.

00:51:48.506 --> 00:51:52.222
LIAM: I will tell you guys, just to remind you of
the things you've never heard of before this very

00:51:52.222 --> 00:51:56.718
second. You know at the top of the stairs is your
father's study where he welcomes guests. Then out

00:51:56.718 --> 00:52:01.873
from there, in a ring on the second floor, are all
of your bedrooms and your Aunt Kat's bedrooms.

00:52:01.873 --> 00:52:06.590
TRAVIS: Nice layout. It's dope. Father's study
first, then?

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:12.773
SAM: All right, I'll hoof it up the stairs and
make for father's study.

00:52:12.773 --> 00:52:14.515
ERICA: The smells weren't coming from there.

00:52:14.515 --> 00:52:15.359
TRAVIS: It's not?

00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:18.094
LIAM: It is.

00:52:18.094 --> 00:52:26.312
SAM: Oh, you're fucking with me. You're always
fucking with me. You're always riding me.

00:52:26.312 --> 00:52:28.086
ERICA: You think you're the funny one?

00:52:30.626 --> 00:52:34.110
TJ: I follow my sister. She knows.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:38.948
SAM: I'll back up against the door and press it
open with my shoulder.

00:52:38.948 --> 00:52:41.977
LIAM: With your gigantic shoulder? Right. With all
the scar tissue on it?

00:52:41.977 --> 00:52:43.396
SAM: Ow. Fuck.

00:52:43.396 --> 00:52:53.111
LIAM: You're pushing it open? All right, you do.
And nothing happens. Oh, that's so satisfying.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:54.471
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's good.

00:52:54.471 --> 00:53:01.373
LIAM: But it's so familiar to you. You look
around, scanning the room, and his shelves of

00:53:01.373 --> 00:53:09.584
books and ledgers are all there. A map of
Wildemount is on the wall, by Deven Rue. Not by

00:53:09.584 --> 00:53:16.173
Deven Rue. The great leather armchair, his great
desk. The thing that is not always there is the

00:53:16.173 --> 00:53:30.811
severed hand sitting on it with a very familiar
silver ring on the ring finger, and a crumpled up

00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:33.070
piece of paper grasped in it.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:37.729
SAM: Lawrence, hide Portia's eyes. She can't see
this.

00:53:37.729 --> 00:53:39.986
TRAVIS: Portia.

00:53:39.986 --> 00:53:42.702
LAURA: Get the fuck off me.

00:53:42.702 --> 00:53:44.242
SAM: You'll faint. It's too gross.

00:53:44.242 --> 00:53:47.074
ERICA: She was never the weak one.

00:53:47.074 --> 00:53:48.091
SAM: Who was?

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:50.243
LAURA: Larry.

00:53:50.243 --> 00:53:53.099
SAM: Yeah, that's true.

00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:57.226
ERICA: Just take deep breaths.

00:53:57.226 --> 00:53:59.580
SAM: Are you going to barf?

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.274
TRAVIS: Would someone please go check the hand?

00:54:02.274 --> 00:54:05.261
ERICA: Brother, deep breaths.

00:54:05.261 --> 00:54:09.799
LAURA: I walk up timidly to the hand and look at
the note.

00:54:09.799 --> 00:54:11.271
LIAM: It grabs you. No.

00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:23.572
LIAM: You pull it out of very stiff fingers and
open it up. Not much is written on it, but what is

00:54:23.909 --> 00:54:32.305
written is, "I have him. Come find him in the
family's crypts." While you're standing over the

00:54:32.305 --> 00:54:38.878
desk looking at this, your eye is drawn to the
rest of the desk and you see many pieces of paper,

00:54:38.878 --> 00:54:51.040
and an inkwell, and quills, and what you deduce
are attempts at forgery. Revisions and revisions

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.868
and revisions and revisions.

00:54:52.868 --> 00:54:54.698
TRAVIS: It was a trap.

00:54:54.698 --> 00:55:03.223
SAM: Who would have known where we all are? And
why would they want us to come? This is all a big

00:55:03.223 --> 00:55:07.486
trap for me? Is it me? This is for me, isn't it?

00:55:07.486 --> 00:55:08.968
LAURA: I take Father's ring.

00:55:08.968 --> 00:55:13.808
LIAM: Yes. Okay. And are you putting it on, or are
you--

00:55:13.808 --> 00:55:18.943
LAURA: I'm going to put it-- Is it magical? I'm
going to put it on a chain around my neck. Do I

00:55:18.943 --> 00:55:21.695
think it's magical? Is it magic?

00:55:21.695 --> 00:55:29.540
LIAM: With Father's love, yes. Also on the wall,
what you know is magical is your father's sword.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.904
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

00:55:30.904 --> 00:55:44.045
LIAM: Vargr, which is a great, black-and-gray
steel blade and an iron hilt. With the skull of a

00:55:44.045 --> 00:55:47.325
wolf carved into the hilt.

00:55:47.325 --> 00:55:48.830
LAURA: Oh god. Is it--

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.219
ERICA: I will take his sword.

00:55:50.219 --> 00:55:51.714
LAURA: Is it a longsword?

00:55:51.714 --> 00:55:52.874
TRAVIS: I don't know if you--

00:55:52.874 --> 00:55:55.070
LAURA: Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:56.562
ERICA: I will take this sword.

00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:59.763
LAURA: You are kind of a magic person, and so
people who, like, use swords should probably use

00:55:59.763 --> 00:56:01.723
the sword. I'm just saying.

00:56:01.723 --> 00:56:02.882
SAM: Let us, let us--

00:56:02.882 --> 00:56:04.194
ERICA: Are you really going to be mean?

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:05.748
LIAM: Portia, it is a longsword.

00:56:05.748 --> 00:56:08.249
LAURA: It's a fucking longsword. That's kind of
what I specialize in, you motherfuckers.

00:56:08.249 --> 00:56:10.041
SAM: I don't want to wolfsplain to you.

00:56:10.056 --> 00:56:13.486
(laughter)

00:56:13.491 --> 00:56:15.600
ERICA: So you're implying I'm incapable of
wielding--

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.264
SAM: No! You can do whatever you want. You're
smoother--

00:56:18.264 --> 00:56:19.906
LAURA: We're just saying you might be better with
a staff.

00:56:19.906 --> 00:56:21.134
ERICA: I have a staff.

00:56:21.134 --> 00:56:23.630
LAURA: That's what I mean.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:26.269
ERICA: I am the eldest. I am the most deserving--

00:56:26.269 --> 00:56:28.169
LAURA: While we're distracting her I go to take
it-- Ooh!

00:56:28.169 --> 00:56:29.173
ERICA: Portia!

00:56:29.173 --> 00:56:36.274
LAURA: You gave up your right when you took up the
fucking woods! I mastered The Taming! I stayed at

00:56:36.274 --> 00:56:37.149
the house!

00:56:37.149 --> 00:56:38.593
ERICA: But where is your wisdom?!

00:56:38.593 --> 00:56:49.066
LAURA: It's right here! This is mine. I earned
this.

00:56:49.066 --> 00:56:52.570
ERICA: If you're going to be petty about it, you
can have it.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.707
LAURA: Thanks.

00:56:56.437 --> 00:56:57.948
ERICA: Where is Father?

00:56:57.948 --> 00:57:05.390
TRAVIS: Is there gore behind the desk, on the
walls? Does it look like he was (gagging) killed

00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:08.017
here or just the hand brought in later?

00:57:08.017 --> 00:57:09.533
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

00:57:09.533 --> 00:57:11.191
SAM: You going to barf?

00:57:11.191 --> 00:57:14.973
TRAVIS: No. 11.

00:57:14.973 --> 00:57:21.621
LIAM: 11? Yeah, it's not too hard to find. There
is a spray of fairly dried blood along the edge of

00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:23.516
the chair and on the floor here.

00:57:23.516 --> 00:57:29.054
TRAVIS: It looks like he was killed perhaps
sitting here at his desk.

00:57:29.054 --> 00:57:31.231
SAM: Are you CSI-ing this right now?

00:57:31.231 --> 00:57:33.889
TRAVIS: Is it not fairly common to the eye?

00:57:33.889 --> 00:57:36.251
SAM: Just looks like a bunch of blood.

00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:45.883
TRAVIS: Yes. But if he was here at his desk, it
begs the question: why was he not on his feet and fighting?

00:57:46.864 --> 00:57:48.555
SAM: Sneak attack.

00:57:48.555 --> 00:57:49.420
TRAVIS: Or someone he knew.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:50.846
ERICA: Was he trapped?

00:57:50.846 --> 00:57:58.399
TRAVIS: Possibly. Do we know of any enemies?
Immediate enemies close to the family that Father

00:57:58.399 --> 00:58:00.633
might have had quarrels with?

00:58:00.633 --> 00:58:04.574
LIAM: No personal grudges.

00:58:04.574 --> 00:58:11.206
TRAVIS: Sitting in his chair is not the way Father
would have gone. Wouldn't you agree, Lucius?

00:58:11.206 --> 00:58:20.211
TJ: (sigh) He is a fighter. Why is his sword still
here? Why did they not take it?

00:58:20.211 --> 00:58:21.088
TRAVIS: Agreed.

00:58:21.088 --> 00:58:26.546
TJ: Why is this place not turned upside down? Why
is everyone dead, but only one person was in here?

00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:29.044
ERICA: Didn't Father-- Did he have a brother?

00:58:29.044 --> 00:58:35.561
LIAM: No. He was an only child. Raised by his
aunt.

00:58:35.561 --> 00:58:41.893
TJ: Katerine. I run to Aunt Katerine's room.

00:58:42.786 --> 00:58:50.803
LIAM: Yeah, okay. You run down the halls. The door
on the end, to the left coming up the stairs. Are

00:58:50.803 --> 00:58:59.377
you going in? Okay. Bust the door open. She has
one of those old four-poster beds. It is clear

00:58:59.377 --> 00:59:08.822
that a scuffle has happened in here. The bed is
askew, and there are shredded claw marks in the

00:59:08.822 --> 00:59:13.453
bedding. Make an investigation check.

00:59:13.453 --> 00:59:21.465
TJ: I pray. 23.

00:59:21.465 --> 00:59:27.917
LIAM: Yeah. That roll was entirely extraneous. You
just walk around the room and once you clear the

00:59:27.917 --> 00:59:38.990
other side of the bed, you find the lifeless body
of your Aunt Katerine in her white gown for

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:43.044
sleeping, run through; dried blood along the white
of it.

00:59:43.044 --> 00:59:44.775
ERICA: What is it, Lucius?

00:59:48.325 --> 01:00:01.740
TJ: I pick her up, and I put her gently on the
bed, and I right her hair.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:05.807
LAURA: But there are claw marks on the bedding.

01:00:09.527 --> 01:00:11.962
TRAVIS: Someone will pay for this.

01:00:11.962 --> 01:00:13.331
LIAM: You rolled a 21?

01:00:13.331 --> 01:00:14.203
TJ: 23 total.

01:00:16.283 --> 01:00:20.548
LIAM: You can tell by the lay of the sheets and
the blankets trailing off the bed on the other

01:00:20.548 --> 01:00:24.157
side, she made those claw marks.

01:00:25.607 --> 01:00:27.135
TRAVIS: Damn.

01:00:27.135 --> 01:00:33.365
LIAM: You guys once saw your brother Benicio in
his werewolf form drunkenly riding on a horse and

01:00:33.365 --> 01:00:38.513
slam his head into a low-hanging tree branch, and
as soon as he passed out and hit the ground, he

01:00:38.513 --> 01:00:40.795
reverted back to his regular form.

01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:45.738
SAM: She fought. This is fucked up.

01:00:45.738 --> 01:00:47.657
TRAVIS: It's more than Father was able to.

01:00:47.657 --> 01:00:51.012
TJ: She was run through once?

01:00:51.012 --> 01:00:53.215
LIAM: No, twice.

01:00:53.215 --> 01:00:56.695
LAURA: Did this happen before they took Father,
or--?

01:01:01.275 --> 01:01:02.473
SAM: All right.

01:01:02.473 --> 01:01:04.543
TRAVIS: What did the letter say? The crypts?

01:01:04.543 --> 01:01:06.254
SAM: The crypts, our family crypts.

01:01:06.254 --> 01:01:09.300
TRAVIS: Do we know what the fastest way to the
crypts would be?

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.728
TJ: Do we know the crypts well?

01:01:11.728 --> 01:01:17.650
LIAM: Yeah, you've been there, not in the last
year because you guys have been off, but at least

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:23.201
once a year, you would go with your father to pay
your respects to your own mother, who lays there

01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:30.698
now, and his mother, who lays there now at the
very rear of the crypt. So yeah, you know it well.

01:01:30.698 --> 01:01:31.951
SAM: It's on the premises?

01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:37.020
LIAM: Yeah. It is, you were quite close to it when
you were standing at the back of Castle Lorelei,

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:42.329
going through your old sneak-away door. It's about
a half-mile away from the back.

01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:49.814
SAM: Before we barrel down there, we should make
sure that there's no one else living or dead

01:01:49.814 --> 01:01:54.644
around. I want to check our room, let's go check
our room.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.162
ERICA: What are we going to do with our aunt?

01:01:56.162 --> 01:01:57.504
TJ: I will bury her.

01:01:57.504 --> 01:01:58.756
SAM: What? Now?

01:01:58.756 --> 01:01:59.486
TJ: Now.

01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:00.348
SAM: Now?

01:02:00.348 --> 01:02:01.006
TJ: Now.

01:02:01.006 --> 01:02:02.861
ERICA: She should be buried in the woods.

01:02:02.861 --> 01:02:04.516
TJ: Help me then.

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:07.321
SAM: You're just going to run off into the woods?
There's someone--

01:02:07.321 --> 01:02:10.148
TRAVIS: Let them bury her.

01:02:10.148 --> 01:02:15.582
TJ: Check the rest, see if there's anyone who can
give us information. Maybe there's a hiding person.

01:02:16.053 --> 01:02:19.655
TRAVIS: Yes. Portia, Benicio, and I shall check
the rest of the floor and then meet you in the

01:02:19.655 --> 01:02:21.374
courtyard by the weapons.

01:02:21.374 --> 01:02:22.732
ERICA: Come, Lucius.

01:02:22.732 --> 01:02:35.403
LIAM: Okay. What I will say is that over the next
90 minutes, and the use of a spade that you grab

01:02:35.936 --> 01:02:43.013
on the way out from the courtyard, you two go out
to the edge of the woods and take care of your

01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:50.195
Aunt Katerine, she was very old. The rest of you
search all of your rooms. You go to the twins'

01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:59.841
rooms first. In that room, your bed has been slept
in, and there are books thrown all over the floor

01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:02.024
and pages torn out of them.

01:03:02.024 --> 01:03:03.951
TRAVIS: (gasps)

01:03:03.951 --> 01:03:09.739
LIAM: You go to your brother Lucius's room and it
looks like his closet has been rifled through

01:03:09.739 --> 01:03:16.779
heavily, there's clothes strewn about the room.
The bed has been slept in. You visit Portia's

01:03:16.779 --> 01:03:24.702
room, you yourself, Portia, and you see that
someone has been sleeping in your bed, too. There

01:03:24.702 --> 01:03:31.788
is a bundle of crossbow bolts leaning against the
wall in this room. There is a somewhat ratty,

01:03:31.788 --> 01:03:39.590
fur-lined vest draped across the writing desk, and
there is a dagger sticking out of the edge of the desk.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:44.626
LAURA: Can I look around that room and see-- I
mean, because, somebody left their weapons here.

01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:47.430
They're still here.

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:55.333
TRAVIS: May I ask: the firmness of the mattresses
in each room. Was one too firm and one too soft

01:03:55.413 --> 01:03:57.226
and one just right?

01:03:57.226 --> 01:03:59.823
LIAM: Just right, yours, Lawrence. Yours was just
right.

01:03:59.823 --> 01:04:01.266
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

01:04:01.266 --> 01:04:09.789
SAM: Question. In my bed, in the hollowed-out
bedposts, was my girly parchment still--

01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:14.874
LIAM: Your paintings of women from Marquet are
still intact.

01:04:14.874 --> 01:04:16.357
SAM: They're still in there.

01:04:16.357 --> 01:04:17.068
TRAVIS: Thank god.

01:04:17.068 --> 01:04:18.020
SAM: I'll pocket those.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.098
LIAM: Yes, the "Seven Dancing Veils" scroll is
still there.

01:04:20.098 --> 01:04:22.195
TRAVIS: Not that I was ever in your room when you
went there.

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:23.743
ERICA: Are we away during this?

01:04:23.743 --> 01:04:29.378
LIAM: You two are off, right. If you want, I can
jump back to you, but let's finish searching the house.

01:04:29.378 --> 01:04:32.566
TRAVIS: The pages that were torn out of the books,
were the books of any import that I would notice?

01:04:32.566 --> 01:04:35.926
LIAM: One was your book on maths that you were
very fond of.

01:04:35.926 --> 01:04:37.790
LAURA: Meths. What is--

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.471
TRAVIS: Math.

01:04:39.471 --> 01:04:46.567
SAM: In England, they call math "maths" and they
call sports "sport."

01:04:46.567 --> 01:04:48.676
TRAVIS: Right, take the 's' off.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:54.686
LIAM: Some of your favorite works of fiction are
torn up.

01:04:54.686 --> 01:04:58.382
TRAVIS: So personal.

01:04:58.382 --> 01:05:02.764
LIAM: One piece of paper has a bit of poo on it in
the absolute corner.

01:05:02.764 --> 01:05:04.178
SAM: Oh, they were using it for toilet paper.

01:05:04.178 --> 01:05:07.593
TRAVIS: Someone wiped their arse with one of my
books?

01:05:07.593 --> 01:05:09.992
LIAM: It is sitting next to a chamber pot, yes,
and your--

01:05:09.992 --> 01:05:12.357
SAM: I did that a lot when we were kids.

01:05:12.357 --> 01:05:14.086
TRAVIS: Did you do this?

01:05:14.086 --> 01:05:18.113
SAM: No, I did not kill our family and go through
your shit.

01:05:18.113 --> 01:05:19.007
TRAVIS: Do I believe him?

01:05:19.007 --> 01:05:20.362
LIAM: Make an insight check.

01:05:20.362 --> 01:05:22.626
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

01:05:22.626 --> 01:05:24.054
LIAM: He's full of shit, he killed them all.

01:05:24.054 --> 01:05:27.751
TRAVIS: Madness! Transform!

01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:32.711
LIAM: In the interest of time, you do search the
other rooms as well. You check your father's

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:37.621
bedroom, which seems to be the first room that is
totally untouched and perfect, not bothered at

01:05:37.621 --> 01:05:47.402
all, as best you can tell. You visit your eldest
sister's room. It almost looks untouched, it looks

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:53.419
fine, the bed is made. There is a strange satchel
on it made of a very dark leather, oiled.

01:05:53.419 --> 01:05:54.486
SAM: This is in Aurra's room?

01:05:54.486 --> 01:06:02.789
LIAM: Yes. It smells strange, not like the bodies
of the dead, but it smells strange, spiced almost,

01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:08.572
and there is a dagger inside it with Elven on the
hilt. Does anyone speak Elven?

01:06:08.572 --> 01:06:09.426
TRAVIS: I do.

01:06:09.426 --> 01:06:11.420
LAURA: Oh, I do. Oh no, I speak Sylvan.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.153
SAM: I do too! I speak Elvish.

01:06:13.153 --> 01:06:13.883
LIAM: Both of you?

01:06:13.883 --> 01:06:15.849
SAM: That was our secret twin language.

01:06:15.849 --> 01:06:24.035
LIAM: It very simply says, "Silent message," in
Elven on the hilt. That's all you find here.

01:06:24.035 --> 01:06:25.495
SAM: Do you want to keep it?

01:06:25.495 --> 01:06:28.645
TRAVIS: Sure. I'll take it.

01:06:28.645 --> 01:06:32.726
LAURA: Lawrence. Why do you pretend you have an
accent?

01:06:32.726 --> 01:06:35.795
TRAVIS: What do you mean pretend? I've been
educated--

01:06:35.795 --> 01:06:37.829
LAURA: We all grew up together, you don't have an
accent.

01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:43.233
TRAVIS: I had tutors from abroad and they rubbed
off. Don't be jealous, okay? Jelly won't serve you here.

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:46.833
(laughter)

01:06:46.846 --> 01:06:48.634
LIAM: Our guests are so disappointed.

01:06:48.634 --> 01:06:54.030
LAURA: She's like, "All of this research?"

01:06:54.030 --> 01:07:05.821
LIAM: "This is what I was sweating?" Let's jump
outside. Is there anything that we're missing with

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:06.751
the two of you?

01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:08.953
TJ: Burial, last rites.

01:07:08.953 --> 01:07:10.200
ERICA: Tears.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.033
LIAM: You were very close to her.

01:07:14.033 --> 01:07:15.066
ERICA: I was.

01:07:15.066 --> 01:07:21.014
LIAM: She told you again and again how much you
reminded her of her older sister.

01:07:21.014 --> 01:07:32.148
ERICA: She did. It's part of the reason why I went
into the woods. I felt like following my innate

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:42.734
path was the right choice, among other things.
Shall we go back to the castle?

01:07:42.734 --> 01:07:49.160
TJ: Say one last parting prayer and we return.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.308
LIAM: All right. You meet up in the courtyard and
report to each other what you found.

01:07:55.308 --> 01:08:01.050
SAM: Found a stinky bag, and a knife, and some poo
pages.

01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:04.458
TRAVIS: Yeah, the stinky bag and the knife were in
your room, sister.

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:07.349
SAM: Yeah, here's the bag. Do you recognize it at
all?

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:13.467
ERICA: I do.

01:08:13.467 --> 01:08:14.350
SAM: What?

01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:16.135
TRAVIS: How?

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:30.471
ERICA: It reminds me of something from before I
took to the woods. Someone was here, I don't

01:08:30.471 --> 01:08:31.759
remember who they were.

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:33.213
SAM: They came visiting?

01:08:33.213 --> 01:08:39.664
ERICA: They did, at least for a portion of the
summer, but it wasn't spoken of. They carried this.

01:08:39.687 --> 01:08:41.834
SAM: Man? Woman?

01:08:41.834 --> 01:08:43.330
LAURA: Were they Elvish?

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:44.783
ERICA: It was a man.

01:08:44.783 --> 01:08:46.563
LAURA: Did they have pointy ears?

01:08:46.563 --> 01:08:49.478
ERICA: He did not have pointy ears. I know what an
elf is.

01:08:49.478 --> 01:08:54.246
SAM: So he was an elf in disguise.

01:08:54.246 --> 01:08:54.969
ERICA: Okay.

01:08:54.969 --> 01:09:02.911
LIAM: You are not a very grand noble family, but
you do have emissaries come.

01:09:02.911 --> 01:09:06.156
TRAVIS: Did he visit just the once?

01:09:06.156 --> 01:09:09.723
ERICA: He did, but he stayed.

01:09:09.723 --> 01:09:13.833
SAM: Was he studying here, or doing business?

01:09:13.833 --> 01:09:15.584
ERICA: I don't recall, I was six.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:19.204
SAM: Do you remember his name?

01:09:19.204 --> 01:09:24.014
ERICA: I don't remember his name, but I don't
remember getting a good feeling from him.

01:09:24.014 --> 01:09:27.708
SAM: Was it an 'A' word? Ah? Eh?

01:09:27.708 --> 01:09:30.949
ERICA: I'm not sure if you heard me the first
time.

01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:33.417
SAM: Well, sometimes it helps me if I think of the
first letter.

01:09:33.417 --> 01:09:37.851
LAURA: Should we go down to the crypts, should we
try to rescue Father?

01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:38.578
ERICA: Yes.

01:09:38.578 --> 01:09:40.595
TJ: Is there anything inside the spike?

01:09:40.595 --> 01:09:44.054
LIAM: It was just the blade that they found.

01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:47.314
TRAVIS: Oh, I do share with the blade to the both
of them.

01:09:47.314 --> 01:09:50.256
ERICA: The smell is familiar. Does anyone else
recognize it?

01:09:50.256 --> 01:09:52.493
LAURA: Do we recognize it?

01:09:52.493 --> 01:09:55.149
LIAM: Make a history check.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:10:00.324
SAM: Smell check. Natural 20.

01:10:00.324 --> 01:10:01.561
TRAVIS: 24.

01:10:01.561 --> 01:10:03.985
TJ: Natural 20 and a prayer.

01:10:03.985 --> 01:10:05.448
LAURA: 18.

01:10:05.448 --> 01:10:08.043
SAM: We're big on smells in this family.

01:10:08.043 --> 01:10:11.327
LIAM: Well, you are.

01:10:11.327 --> 01:10:14.334
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're like (inhaling) Flashback!

01:10:16.294 --> 01:10:21.676
LIAM: None of you have ever traveled abroad, but
you have been to different parts of Wildemount.

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:35.029
This bag is not any kind of bag you have seen, any
kind of style of fashion in any of the places that

01:10:35.029 --> 01:10:35.872
you've traveled.

01:10:35.872 --> 01:10:43.553
LAURA: It's definitely not from Wildemount.

01:10:43.553 --> 01:10:45.348
ERICA: Does no one remember the smell?

01:10:45.348 --> 01:10:48.827
LAURA: No. If you were six, we weren't born yet.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:57.244
TJ: While they're talking, I prepare myself for
the crypts. I go put my armor on and gather my own

01:10:57.244 --> 01:10:58.629
shield and weapons.

01:10:58.629 --> 01:10:59.690
LIAM: Excellent.

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:06.927
LAURA: I sit down in the rain with Father's sword
across my knees and try to figure out what it does.

01:11:06.927 --> 01:11:15.817
LIAM: You don't have to. It is a badass longsword.
Your father has let you wield it before in

01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:23.397
training. It is a plus two longsword, it does not
require attunement. It is very finely made and

01:11:23.397 --> 01:11:24.360
very sharp.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:35.460
SAM: I'm going to find some burnt coal or burnt
wood, streak across my face a couple times,

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.777
getting ready for battle.

01:11:36.777 --> 01:11:38.848
TRAVIS: It's raining, you moron.

01:11:38.848 --> 01:11:40.546
SAM: Oh shit.

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:46.129
LIAM: No, actually, in the last five to ten
minutes, it has slowed to a drizzle.

01:11:46.379 --> 01:11:47.985
TRAVIS: It is drizzling, you moron.

01:11:47.985 --> 01:11:50.258
LIAM: Now it's misting at this point.

01:11:50.258 --> 01:11:53.667
TRAVIS: It's only misting, it should last a good
while.

01:11:53.667 --> 01:12:02.466
SAM: Anything you need to do to prepare? We're
going into some shit down there.

01:12:02.466 --> 01:12:05.066
TRAVIS: No, I'm always ready.

01:12:05.066 --> 01:12:13.183
SAM: That's creepy. How about you, Aurra? Are you
ready for this?

01:12:13.183 --> 01:12:17.481
ERICA: No, but I will proceed.

01:12:17.481 --> 01:12:20.806
LAURA: (whispering) There's no plus two longsword
in D&D Beyond.

01:12:20.806 --> 01:12:23.939
TRAVIS: You just add it in your head. Just do it
on the fly.

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:25.458
LIAM: You just add it, man.

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:27.112
LAURA: I don't understand what you guys are
saying.

01:12:27.112 --> 01:12:32.849
LIAM: You guys exit through the same chapel that
you entered in.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.428
LAURA: I add it to my hit, or do I add it to my
damage, or both?

01:12:35.428 --> 01:12:36.547
LIAM: Both.

01:12:36.547 --> 01:12:37.845
LAURA: Awesome.

01:12:37.845 --> 01:12:45.723
LIAM: You exit out the back of the keep, and it is
dark out, although you are starting to get

01:12:45.955 --> 01:12:53.325
occasional wisps of the moon, almost full,
appearing as the clouds break and then cover

01:12:53.325 --> 01:13:01.871
again. To get to the family crypts, they were
built into a cave system discovered hundreds of

01:13:01.871 --> 01:13:09.206
years ago, and that you follow along the treeline
about a quarter mile in that direction. It wraps

01:13:09.206 --> 01:13:19.514
around and that leads you to a mausoleum. What's
the other word? Sepulcher?

01:13:19.514 --> 01:13:24.234
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a domed entrance to the--

01:13:24.234 --> 01:13:32.954
LIAM: It's a small building that serves as an
entrance to the greater crypts below. We set off

01:13:32.954 --> 01:13:34.220
in that direction, I assume?

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.123
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:13:35.123 --> 01:13:37.724
LIAM: Are we marching merrily along, are we doing
anything special?

01:13:37.724 --> 01:13:39.945
LAURA: Are we trying to be sneaky?

01:13:39.945 --> 01:13:41.254
TRAVIS: Fuck that.

01:13:41.254 --> 01:13:43.822
LAURA: They know we're here. They know we're
coming.

01:13:43.822 --> 01:13:45.332
TRAVIS: Going to carve them.

01:13:45.332 --> 01:13:47.159
ERICA: Do you feel the moon?

01:13:47.159 --> 01:13:47.741
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:13:47.741 --> 01:13:49.617
TJ: I always feel the moon.

01:13:49.617 --> 01:13:55.928
TRAVIS: I admit I feel a little, it's not as
strong an urge, but yes, some.

01:13:55.928 --> 01:14:01.508
LIAM: This conversation happens as you trudge
through the tall grass behind the keep.

01:14:01.508 --> 01:14:09.231
TJ: The final bit though, we cannot approach from
the front. Several people it took to kill an

01:14:09.231 --> 01:14:15.485
entire castle of our friends and family. If
they're waiting for us, they will expect it from

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:17.033
the front, no doubt.

01:14:17.033 --> 01:14:19.261
TRAVIS: He speaks true.

01:14:19.261 --> 01:14:21.500
LAURA: Should we split up and enter from both
sides?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.000
TJ: We should never split up.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:23.675
ERICA: I agree.

01:14:23.675 --> 01:14:29.916
TJ: This is what caused this, unfortunately. We
should come around from the side, I think?

01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:37.565
LIAM: Okay. You know intimately what it looks
like. It is a low wall, surrounds the entire

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:45.262
cemetery, and it's broken, it's old, so the wall
is fragmented and easy to enter from any side,

01:14:45.262 --> 01:14:52.094
really. There's a wrought-iron fence that is aging
and decrepit, but that also surrounds the

01:14:52.094 --> 01:14:58.817
mausoleum itself. Many generations are buried both
in the grounds and below.

01:14:58.817 --> 01:15:10.709
LIAM: Alfarr, the first wolf, is buried within,
but you could potentially enter from any of the

01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:16.177
four sides. To get to the rear, you would probably
have to cut into the woods and then pop back out

01:15:16.177 --> 01:15:17.396
again, but that's possible.

01:15:17.396 --> 01:15:23.514
TJ: I would like to suggest that to the group. She
can guide us through the woods best and we can

01:15:23.514 --> 01:15:26.263
have a look to see if there's anything waiting for
us.

01:15:26.263 --> 01:15:31.006
TRAVIS: I'm already covered in muck. No
objections.

01:15:31.006 --> 01:15:34.533
ERICA: I would be more comfortable as my wolf
self.

01:15:34.533 --> 01:15:37.703
SAM: You want to turn now?

01:15:37.703 --> 01:15:39.870
ERICA: The moon is full, brother.

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:45.071
SAM: Well yeah, but you don't have to-- I mean,
you're pretty scary when you're a wolf.

01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:47.895
ERICA: Not a full wolf, brother.

01:15:47.895 --> 01:15:53.182
SAM: All right. Well, maybe not yet.

01:15:53.182 --> 01:15:54.607
LAURA: I'm not doing it.

01:15:54.607 --> 01:15:56.461
TRAVIS: Do it, sister, set the tone.

01:15:56.461 --> 01:15:59.269
ERICA: Thank you. I become a werewolf.

01:15:59.269 --> 01:16:01.549
TRAVIS: Yeah! Sorry.

01:16:01.549 --> 01:16:11.332
LIAM: You watch as Aurra pops her shoulders and
twists her neck and you see her grow a full two or

01:16:11.332 --> 01:16:18.734
three inches and her shoulders widen and that very
familiar prickle of fur, which starts like needles

01:16:18.734 --> 01:16:25.597
but then pushes out and becomes thick. Do me a
favor, Erica. What is the pattern of fur?

01:16:25.597 --> 01:16:27.740
ERICA: Gray with white.

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:40.837
LIAM: She stands there, her breath floating in the
air. It's cold now after the rain. You're seeing

01:16:40.837 --> 01:16:44.386
her breath in great heaves in the air.

01:16:44.386 --> 01:16:46.986
SAM: Haven't seen that in a while.

01:16:46.986 --> 01:16:53.065
TJ: She has mastered the gift. It is effortless
and graceful. Moonweaver bless you.

01:16:53.065 --> 01:16:55.496
ERICA: Thank you, brother.

01:16:55.496 --> 01:16:57.660
SAM: I'll guess you'll lead the way, then?

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.709
LIAM: So through the woods to the back?

01:16:59.709 --> 01:17:01.232
SAM: Is that where we're going?

01:17:01.232 --> 01:17:02.188
ERICA: To the back?

01:17:02.188 --> 01:17:09.821
LIAM: Well, you can approach. It's open almost
from all sides, so there is definitely an entrance.

01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:13.288
ERICA: Yes. Through the woods.

01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:17.921
SAM: Lawrence? I think the moon is affecting you.
Your hands are already turning.

01:17:17.921 --> 01:17:18.713
TRAVIS: What?

01:17:18.713 --> 01:17:21.800
SAM: I slap his hand into his face when he looks
down at it.

01:17:24.903 --> 01:17:30.521
LIAM: You know that in times of great traumatic
pain, Benicio has always sought solace in slap dick humor.

01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:34.104
TRAVIS: Well played, brother.

01:17:34.104 --> 01:17:36.767
ERICA: Don't resist it.

01:17:36.767 --> 01:17:43.730
LIAM: Into the woods you go. I don't require any
rolls for this, to find the way, because you've

01:17:43.984 --> 01:17:50.904
done it many times. You lead your siblings through
the woods in an arc and take about 20 minutes to

01:17:50.904 --> 01:17:56.243
reach a point where you know if you then veer back
to your right and out of the woods, you will be

01:17:56.243 --> 01:18:01.430
will be about a hundred yards away from the
cemetery grounds.

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:13.257
TJ: We're here solely to first gain information
about our enemy and to see if they lie in wait for us.

01:18:13.257 --> 01:18:15.264
LAURA: So we should move stealthily?

01:18:15.264 --> 01:18:18.758
TJ: I should not lead the way.

01:18:18.758 --> 01:18:20.409
ERICA: I will go on all fours.

01:18:20.409 --> 01:18:21.165
TRAVIS: Indeed.

01:18:21.165 --> 01:18:23.786
TJ: I'll hang back and allow them, but I'll keep
looking.

01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:27.577
LIAM: So we're stealthing in? Are you hanging
back, Lucius?

01:18:27.577 --> 01:18:33.385
TJ: I hang back a healthy distance while I can
still see them because I'm not good at dexterous--

01:18:33.701 --> 01:18:35.203
LIAM: Well how far back are we saying?

01:18:35.203 --> 01:18:38.393
TJ: 15, 20, 30 feet. Whatever is comfortable.

01:18:38.393 --> 01:18:43.920
LIAM: So I'll say: everyone, make a straight
stealth check.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.078
TJ: I pray for my stealth check.

01:18:46.078 --> 01:18:47.375
LAURA: Shit.

01:18:47.375 --> 01:18:50.175
ERICA: Great. I'm a two.

01:18:50.175 --> 01:18:52.445
SAM: Well, she had a natural one.

01:18:52.445 --> 01:18:53.489
LIAM: Okay.

01:18:53.489 --> 01:18:56.280
TRAVIS: Oh amazing, in your werewolf form?

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.188
LAURA: I got a total of six.

01:18:58.188 --> 01:18:58.648
ERICA: Yep.

01:18:58.648 --> 01:19:03.738
LIAM: Okay, so you guys are stealthing through the
tall, wet grass after leaving the forest behind

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:05.041
you. What did you get, Lucius?

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:05.606
TJ: 12.

01:19:05.606 --> 01:19:06.830
TRAVIS: 17.

01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:07.760
LIAM: 17.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.390
SAM: 11.

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:16.226
LIAM: Everyone was worried about Lucius. Aurra is
so thirsty now that she starts, in the still of

01:19:16.226 --> 01:19:24.979
the night, you hear that deep roiling growl in her
giant rib cage now, but you stalk through the

01:19:24.979 --> 01:19:39.963
grass and you see that low wall ahead of you and
the rear wall of the mausoleum where the

01:19:39.963 --> 01:19:50.519
ceremonial entrance to the crypts. You don't see
anything from back here and the main cemetery

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:58.331
grounds are in front of the structure. Are we
going to creep up to the wall?

01:19:58.331 --> 01:20:00.250
ERICA: We're going to climb the wall.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.090
SAM: Climb the wall?

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:02.587
ERICA: We're going to climb the wall.

01:20:02.587 --> 01:20:03.507
TJ: How high is this wall?

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:06.547
LIAM: The wall is only five feet and it's broken
in places. You can just walk through.

01:20:06.547 --> 01:20:08.577
LAURA: As they climb it I walk around it.

01:20:08.577 --> 01:20:12.627
ERICA: I attempt to climb the wall and dislodge a
stone in my stealth.

01:20:12.627 --> 01:20:15.520
LIAM: So you scrabble up, claw your way up.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.507
ERICA: All fours.

01:20:16.507 --> 01:20:19.785
LIAM: Portia strides in regally alongside you.

01:20:19.785 --> 01:20:20.929
LAURA: Really?!

01:20:20.929 --> 01:20:29.478
LIAM: You're now standing at the very rear side of
this stone, small building, not much bigger than

01:20:29.478 --> 01:20:38.597
the space that we're all in right now, in this
studio. You don't hear anything, you don't see

01:20:38.597 --> 01:20:40.943
anything. What do you want to do here?

01:20:40.943 --> 01:20:43.284
TRAVIS: Does your keen nose sense anything?

01:20:43.284 --> 01:20:47.503
LAURA: Can you smell Father?

01:20:47.503 --> 01:20:49.827
ERICA: No, but I smell that satchel.

01:20:49.827 --> 01:20:55.163
LIAM: Make a perception check. At advantage.

01:20:55.163 --> 01:20:58.084
LAURA: Ooh, that means roll it twice.

01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:00.937
ERICA: Is that--

01:21:00.937 --> 01:21:01.623
LAURA: That's a nine.

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.567
ERICA: That's a nine.

01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:04.166
LIAM: At advantage, so roll again.

01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:06.456
SAM: Do it again and take the better number.

01:21:06.456 --> 01:21:08.745
LAURA: Ooh, much better.

01:21:08.745 --> 01:21:09.910
ERICA: 16.

01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:10.674
LAURA: Plus?

01:21:10.674 --> 01:21:11.973
ERICA: Plus--

01:21:11.973 --> 01:21:13.211
SAM: Other things.

01:21:13.211 --> 01:21:13.940
LAURA: Perception?

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.532
ERICA: Perception is (counting)

01:21:15.532 --> 01:21:17.696
LAURA: Whoa, 23!

01:21:17.696 --> 01:21:19.537
ERICA: Thank you. Jesus. Wow.

01:21:19.537 --> 01:21:28.329
LIAM: You smell blood. You smell living, breathing
human blood.

01:21:28.329 --> 01:21:31.033
TJ: I shuffle closer.

01:21:31.033 --> 01:21:33.491
ERICA: Be careful, brother.

01:21:33.491 --> 01:21:38.702
LIAM: Right now, you guys do not see much, you're
just standing at the back of the building.

01:21:38.702 --> 01:21:40.698
SAM: There's no door or windows?

01:21:40.698 --> 01:21:44.091
LIAM: Not back here, no. You know it's on the
other side. The exact opposite side of where you are.

01:21:44.219 --> 01:21:45.135
SAM: Let's go around.

01:21:45.135 --> 01:21:46.776
LAURA: Do I hear movement?

01:21:46.776 --> 01:21:48.761
LIAM: Make a perception check.

01:21:54.496 --> 01:21:55.340
LAURA: Ten.

01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:07.089
LIAM: No, just the occasional drift of rain for a
few seconds and then stopping. It's on and off

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:08.035
right now.

01:22:08.247 --> 01:22:12.380
TRAVIS: Lucius, if we're going to be making our
way around, it wouldn't hurt to take both flanks.

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:15.839
TJ: Very well. I will follow Aurra.

01:22:15.839 --> 01:22:18.125
SAM: You're going to go with Aurra?

01:22:18.710 --> 01:22:20.145
ERICA: Yes, he's going to go with me.

01:22:20.145 --> 01:22:22.253
SAM: All right. Want to take the other side?

01:22:22.253 --> 01:22:23.332
TRAVIS: Yes, indeed.

01:22:23.332 --> 01:22:25.245
LAURA: I'll go with the lame-o twins.

01:22:25.245 --> 01:22:29.311
SAM: So you're with Aurra and Lucius then? Because
we're pretty awesome.

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:30.957
TRAVIS: Yeah. Bros.

01:22:30.957 --> 01:22:35.574
LIAM: So it is Lawrence, Benicio, Portia. So three
blood hunters.

01:22:35.574 --> 01:22:37.006
SAM: Oh, that seems fair.

01:22:37.006 --> 01:22:42.740
LIAM: And our lady of the wood and our man of the
claw. Okay, who's taking the left and who's taking

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:43.449
the right?

01:22:43.449 --> 01:22:44.750
ERICA: We will take the left.

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:46.000
LAURA: We'll take the right.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.472
LIAM: Okay. Still stealthing along, creeping
around the edges, you start to see the wrought

01:22:51.472 --> 01:23:00.993
iron fence that surrounds this building. You also
see the cemetery has been, from your vantage

01:23:00.993 --> 01:23:05.425
point-- and there is, you can't see the source,
but there is actually light here. There is

01:23:05.425 --> 01:23:11.843
flickering light being reflected from some source
that you're not able to see on the cemetery which

01:23:11.843 --> 01:23:24.331
has been abused. You see headstones pushed over.
You see piles of mud. You see cloth or canvas

01:23:24.331 --> 01:23:29.775
tarps lying about in great puddles. It's a mess.

01:23:29.775 --> 01:23:33.308
LAURA: Is someone camping in our cemetery?

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:36.363
TRAVIS: Yeah I go and inspect one of the canvas
tarps.

01:23:36.363 --> 01:23:39.254
LIAM: They're further towards the entrance.

01:23:39.254 --> 01:23:40.483
TRAVIS: I don't mind.

01:23:40.483 --> 01:23:42.054
TJ: You said that's where light is coming from?

01:23:42.054 --> 01:23:49.544
LIAM: No. If this were the building right here and
I'm you guys initially coming around the side, you

01:23:49.544 --> 01:23:54.360
would see the light reflecting off of things over
there. So it's here, but out of view.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.187
TJ: There is light directly in front of the
building that we cannot see the source.

01:23:57.187 --> 01:23:58.655
LIAM: That you can't see the source, right.

01:23:58.655 --> 01:23:59.207
ERICA: Flame light?

01:23:59.207 --> 01:24:02.020
LIAM: It looks like it, the light is shifting,
yeah.

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.064
TJ: Listen.

01:24:03.064 --> 01:24:09.319
LIAM: You hear just the gentle crackle of fire.

01:24:09.319 --> 01:24:12.747
ERICA: I'm on my legs again just for the record.

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:15.497
TJ: So we smell smoke?

01:24:15.497 --> 01:24:21.592
LIAM: Make a perception check at advantage. No,
you're not a-- make a perception check.

01:24:21.592 --> 01:24:26.870
TJ: Pray. 19 plus seven.

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:27.845
SAM: Jesus.

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:30.266
LIAM: Yeah, it's faint--

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:31.858
TJ: 29 total.

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:37.689
LIAM: Whoa! It's faint, but you feel that telling
acrid smell of a torch.

01:24:37.689 --> 01:24:42.035
TJ: I tell my sister, but she already knows.

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:49.340
TRAVIS: I would assume we have the element of
surprise, yes?

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.105
SAM: There's only one door in?

01:24:51.105 --> 01:24:52.221
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:54.147
SAM: Should we just bum rush it?

01:24:54.147 --> 01:24:58.649
LAURA: I mean, we're on opposite sides we have to
communicate with our siblings on the the other.

01:24:58.649 --> 01:25:00.781
(pigeon cooing)

01:25:00.781 --> 01:25:04.023
TJ: We're on opposite sides of a solid building?
We cannot see each other.

01:25:04.023 --> 01:25:07.378
LIAM: Stone building. Yeah, you guys are exactly
opposite each other right now.

01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:10.732
LAURA: Campfire. (more pigeon coos)

01:25:10.732 --> 01:25:12.668
LIAM: They're doing a running gag that you guys
are not in on.

01:25:12.668 --> 01:25:17.126
TRAVIS: The twins and Portia begin to creep closer
towards the source of light.

01:25:17.126 --> 01:25:18.648
LAURA: Yeah.

01:25:18.648 --> 01:25:23.819
TJ: I suggest to my sister that I have no doubt
they will attack if given the chance, so we'll

01:25:23.819 --> 01:25:25.858
just wait for the sign, perhaps.

01:25:25.858 --> 01:25:28.248
SAM: Now we don't smell anything yet, do we?

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:29.874
LAURA: Do we see the light?

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:31.762
LIAM: Have you turned the corner?

01:25:31.762 --> 01:25:34.817
LAURA: Have we? I mean, we saw the dancing
reflection.

01:25:34.817 --> 01:25:36.075
TRAVIS: We moved to turn the corner.

01:25:36.075 --> 01:25:37.119
LAURA: Stealthily.

01:25:37.119 --> 01:25:47.193
LIAM: You move to turn the corner. There's a giant
wooden door that is closed here, locked for all

01:25:47.193 --> 01:25:56.880
time unless Father's bringing you here for visits.
But that door apparently is wide open and you

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.146
still can't see the source, but the flickering
light's coming from inside.

01:26:01.146 --> 01:26:06.883
LAURA: Can we creep up to the edge of the door? I
want to see if I can see a reflection in my sword.

01:26:06.883 --> 01:26:08.333
You know, if I stick--

01:26:08.333 --> 01:26:09.356
LIAM: So you're going to--

01:26:09.356 --> 01:26:10.722
LAURA: Use it like a mirror, you know?

01:26:10.722 --> 01:26:16.768
LIAM: Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. As you
stand there and hold your father's blade out to

01:26:16.768 --> 01:26:22.260
try to catch the light, you hear a sound from
behind you from two places. The sound of fabric

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:32.535
and you hear-- and this is happening in a second--
metal banging off stone. Turning to look, you see

01:26:32.535 --> 01:26:41.504
there are two men at opposite corners of the
cemetery in the act of throwing canvas off of

01:26:41.504 --> 01:26:52.440
themselves. Each of them has a censer, a small
metal box or cylinder hanging from a chain and the

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:59.754
metal is an oily black color or texture. You see
in that split second they're starting to spin them

01:26:59.754 --> 01:27:09.414
and a sickly green mist or smoke is coming out of
them. You start, in your peripheral vision on all

01:27:09.414 --> 01:27:12.988
sides, to see a little bit of movement. Everybody
roll for initiative.

01:27:12.988 --> 01:27:14.663
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:16.371
LIAM: Hold that number in your head.

01:27:16.371 --> 01:27:17.482
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:19.360
LAURA: Oh my god, he's getting a map.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.968
ERICA: Is this the bottom or the top is the dot?

01:27:21.968 --> 01:27:22.980
SAM: I think that--

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.204
LAURA: The bottom is the dot.

01:27:24.204 --> 01:27:26.557
ERICA: The bottom is the dot? So it's a nine-- oh
I see. Got it.

01:27:26.557 --> 01:27:28.105
LAURA: And you have an initiative number.

01:27:28.105 --> 01:27:29.984
ERICA: Yes, okay. Oh, it's up here.

01:27:29.984 --> 01:27:31.607
ERICA: Delightful.

01:27:31.607 --> 01:27:34.386
TRAVIS: Look at your sheets.

01:27:34.386 --> 01:27:36.244
SAM: Oh boy, look at this map!

01:27:36.244 --> 01:27:38.621
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:41.864
SAM: Liam, you've gone above and beyond.

01:27:41.864 --> 01:27:43.525
LAURA: This is amazing!

01:27:43.525 --> 01:27:45.496
SAM: But wait, there's a lot of bad guys here.

01:27:45.496 --> 01:27:48.411
LAURA: Are those dead people? What's going on?

01:27:48.411 --> 01:27:58.763
LIAM: We've got Lucius and here's our low wall.
Lucius. Who do we think is where? Lucius in the

01:27:58.763 --> 01:28:01.449
lead or is Aurra?

01:28:01.449 --> 01:28:03.248
ERICA: I would be in the lead.

01:28:03.248 --> 01:28:17.314
LIAM: Okay, we have Portia and the twins right
here at the door. Okay. And our men, here's one of

01:28:17.347 --> 01:28:21.279
them, right here. He has long dark brown hair and
angular face.

01:28:21.279 --> 01:28:23.155
LAURA: And he's bringing up the dead.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:30.679
LIAM: We have a man who's got-- his head is mostly
shaved, but wet nappy blueish hair pasted to his

01:28:30.679 --> 01:28:35.129
skull and is wearing some of Lucius' clothing.

01:28:35.129 --> 01:28:37.646
LAURA: That's the dick that was in your room.

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:43.187
TRAVIS: So this is a person-- This is a person,
right?

01:28:43.187 --> 01:28:49.522
LIAM: That is seemingly a person, that's a person.
Everything else is dead.

01:28:49.522 --> 01:28:52.165
SAM: And it's not moving?

01:28:52.165 --> 01:28:58.456
LIAM :No, beginning to move. So let's get those
initiative rolls, guys.

01:28:58.456 --> 01:28:59.702
SAM: Oh boy.

01:28:59.702 --> 01:29:01.112
ERICA: Ten.

01:29:01.112 --> 01:29:03.345
LIAM: Oh sorry, 25 to 20.

01:29:03.345 --> 01:29:06.285
TRAVIS: Anybody roll 25 to 20? No? Okay.

01:29:06.285 --> 01:29:08.028
LIAM: Okay. 15 to 20.

01:29:08.028 --> 01:29:09.181
LAURA: 18.

01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:12.891
LIAM: 18. Okay. I'm going to use these things
called stat trackers to help me remember what the

01:29:12.891 --> 01:29:14.398
heck is going on.

01:29:14.398 --> 01:29:16.603
SAM: This episode not brought to you by stat
trackers.

01:29:16.603 --> 01:29:21.439
LIAM: But they're really nifty. Where's the Portia
one? It's got all your info on it so I can see.

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:23.707
We'll start here. You're first up.

01:29:23.707 --> 01:29:24.824
LAURA: Ooh, cool!

01:29:24.824 --> 01:29:26.220
LIAM: Did anyone get ten to 15?

01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:26.878
SAM: 16.

01:29:26.878 --> 01:29:28.567
ERICA: I got ten total.

01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:30.708
LIAM: Hold on, we'll get you all in order.

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:31.887
TRAVIS: I got 12.

01:29:31.887 --> 01:29:34.725
LIAM: Benicio, you got?

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:35.804
ERICA: Ten.

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:40.523
LIAM: Ten, you got 12, so Lawrence, Aurra. Lucius,
what did you roll?

01:29:40.523 --> 01:29:43.461
TJ: Technically, it's like zero.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:45.751
LIAM: Gotcha.

01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:47.667
ERICA: All those fun 20s over there.

01:29:47.667 --> 01:29:49.388
TRAVIS: He front loaded them.

01:29:49.388 --> 01:29:51.126
SAM: Should have prayed.

01:29:51.126 --> 01:29:53.870
TRAVIS: That's what I asked him if he could. He
said no.

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:56.180
LIAM: And oh man.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:02.996
TRAVIS: Portia, Benicio, Lawrence, Aurra, Lucius.

01:30:02.996 --> 01:30:07.736
LAURA: Ooh skelly, skelly, skeletons! Oh, we can
see when they go? That's good.

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.116
LIAM: Portia.

01:30:09.116 --> 01:30:10.323
LAURA: Oh, that's me!

01:30:10.323 --> 01:30:11.479
LIAM: You are first.

01:30:11.479 --> 01:30:12.990
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.142
SAM: All right, Portia.

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:15.871
LAURA: Okay. Oh god!

01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:19.370
TRAVIS: You know what you're doing!

01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:20.945
LAURA: Totally!

01:30:20.945 --> 01:30:22.588
SAM: You've got a badass sword--

01:30:22.588 --> 01:30:24.114
LAURA: I've got a badass sword!

01:30:24.114 --> 01:30:25.634
SAM: We're just going to run away.

01:30:25.634 --> 01:30:27.589
LAURA: Oh wait, I'm not seeing my bonus actions
here?

01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:31.099
LIAM: Help me, spirit of Matt! Where's your battle
music? Is it happening? Can you hear it?

01:30:31.099 --> 01:30:32.633
SAM: I don't hear anything.

01:30:32.633 --> 01:30:34.410
LIAM and ERICA: Come on, battle music.

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:38.602
SAM: Jiggle the tip? Jiggle the cord?

01:30:38.602 --> 01:30:40.465
LIAM: Jiggle the cord?

01:30:40.465 --> 01:30:42.012
TRAVIS: I'm sure there's cords.

01:30:42.012 --> 01:30:46.956
LAURA: So our curses we can do once per-- no, our
curses was can just do every turn?

01:30:46.956 --> 01:30:48.318
SAM: Yes.

01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:52.757
LIAM: You can, per a long rest, do a curse two
times.

01:30:52.757 --> 01:30:57.618
SAM: Curses are more for reactions. Well, I don't
know what yours are.

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.600
LAURA: Mine is the Blood Curse of Binding!

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:02.222
ERICA: And can I do all these things as a werewolf
still?

01:31:02.222 --> 01:31:06.206
LIAM: Yes, in werewolf form you can still do all
your druidic spells.

01:31:06.206 --> 01:31:11.959
LAURA: Binding is not-- is as many times as I
want, right? Because it's just a bonus action.

01:31:11.959 --> 01:31:15.842
LIAM: No, it's two times you can do one of those
Maledicts.

01:31:15.842 --> 01:31:17.204
LAURA: Oh really?

01:31:17.204 --> 01:31:19.271
LIAM: As I understand it.

01:31:19.271 --> 01:31:23.919
LAURA: Then I'm going to hold on, and I'm going
to-- but the gate is closed?

01:31:23.919 --> 01:31:28.265
LIAM: No, this gate is-- you know, it's a model.
This gate is hanging open, there's gaps, there's

01:31:28.265 --> 01:31:33.023
this skeleton there. There's a dead warrior here.
These are your ancestors, by the way.

01:31:33.023 --> 01:31:35.530
ERICA, SAM, and LAURA: Oh god, no.

01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:37.337
LAURA: (southern accent) Why you got to play it
like that?

01:31:37.337 --> 01:31:38.720
TRAVIS: Uncle Carl!

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:43.207
LAURA: I'm going to run up to this guy in the
corner closest to me.

01:31:43.207 --> 01:31:44.539
LIAM: This one here?

01:31:44.539 --> 01:31:57.381
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to swipe at his legs!
Because I don't want to take his head off because

01:31:57.381 --> 01:31:58.927
he's my ancestor!

01:31:58.927 --> 01:32:01.069
SAM: (singing) 'Cause I don't want to take his
head off.

01:32:01.069 --> 01:32:07.500
LAURA: So I'm going to roll. Ooh! That's a 24!

01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:08.962
LIAM: Okay that hits!

01:32:08.962 --> 01:32:13.433
TRAVIS: You're not changing?

01:32:13.433 --> 01:32:17.279
LAURA: Not yet! 14 damage!

01:32:17.279 --> 01:32:25.991
LIAM: Okay, so Portia runs forward with her father's
blade, rams the sword through the ribs of this--

01:32:26.032 --> 01:32:27.807
LAURA: No, I'm taking his legs off.

01:32:27.939 --> 01:32:31.086
LIAM: Taking his legs off? Okay you cleave right
through. They are brittle and snap into pieces,

01:32:31.086 --> 01:32:38.208
and the thing just falls to the ground and breaks
into seven or eight different fragments of person.

01:32:38.208 --> 01:32:40.734
They shake for a moment and lie still.

01:32:40.734 --> 01:32:42.485
SAM: He's dead?

01:32:42.485 --> 01:32:44.636
LIAM: Well, he was already dead, but he's gone.

01:32:44.636 --> 01:32:45.809
SAM: He's deader.

01:32:45.809 --> 01:32:52.379
LAURA: My second attack I'm going to run forward
and get this other guy closest to me. I'm going to

01:32:52.379 --> 01:32:53.532
try it again!

01:32:53.532 --> 01:32:54.544
LIAM: Go for it.

01:32:54.544 --> 01:32:55.514
SAM: Portia!

01:32:55.514 --> 01:32:58.322
LAURA: That's not as good, that's a 12.

01:32:58.322 --> 01:33:06.937
LIAM: That does not hit. You go to stab through,
and it actually goes through an empty space in the

01:33:06.937 --> 01:33:13.067
creature's body. It pulls away. It does go through
its ribs, but does nothing to it, and it turns

01:33:13.067 --> 01:33:18.443
towards you. Now it is Benicio's turn, unless you
wanted to do anything else?

01:33:18.443 --> 01:33:22.583
LAURA: I'm going to look at the living guy, and
I'm going to go: I fucking see you.

01:33:22.583 --> 01:33:26.631
LIAM: Okay. And now we're onto Benicio.

01:33:26.631 --> 01:33:42.754
SAM: Oh man! I'm going to see my sister in
trouble, and be like: No way! I run up to her, on

01:33:42.754 --> 01:33:46.683
her six. I can get there, right?

01:33:46.683 --> 01:33:48.251
LIAM: Yeah, you can get to there.

01:33:48.251 --> 01:33:50.792
SAM: Glaive attack the skeleton that's on her!

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:54.443
LIAM: Sure. Also, as you're running up here,
you're noticing not a skeleton, but what

01:33:54.443 --> 01:34:00.334
apparently is just a dog who came here to die is
also climbing up over the stone wall. But you're

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.993
attacking this one? Go for it. Roll to attack.

01:34:02.993 --> 01:34:05.933
SAM: That's a 21 to hit!

01:34:05.933 --> 01:34:07.528
LIAM: That hits, for sure!

01:34:07.528 --> 01:34:12.427
SAM: Sure! That's seven points of damage.

01:34:12.427 --> 01:34:18.766
LIAM: Okay. You bring the glaive down straight on
top of its head, and it just collapses in like a

01:34:18.766 --> 01:34:22.090
skeletal accordion. It smashes to the ground.

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:24.548
SAM: Not moving?

01:34:24.548 --> 01:34:31.622
LIAM: Yeah. Three seconds later it is just a pile
of bone and rags. It is not moving.

01:34:31.622 --> 01:34:34.859
SAM: Am I within range of the dog?

01:34:34.859 --> 01:34:37.470
LIAM: Sure, if you take one more step.

01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:42.208
SAM: I'll spin and attack this dog! Not even
knowing if it's a good dog or a bad dog.

01:34:42.208 --> 01:34:43.343
LAURA: No!

01:34:43.343 --> 01:34:44.528
LIAM: It's dead.

01:34:44.528 --> 01:34:45.980
LAURA: Oh, it's a dead dog?

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:48.991
LIAM: Half of its face is hanging off. There's a
lot of flesh on the bones too, but not all the flesh.

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:52.161
SAM: Okay. Ka-kow! Ooh. 25.

01:34:52.161 --> 01:35:00.035
LIAM: 25? You take your glaive and you toss it up
into the air, and then swing it like a gigantic

01:35:00.035 --> 01:35:07.422
oversized golf club. The glaive's blade catches
into the dog's guts. Something bursts inside,

01:35:07.422 --> 01:35:11.942
sprays your boot, and the dog goes (dying snarl)
and flies through the air and crashes and rolls

01:35:11.942 --> 01:35:13.463
down the hill.

01:35:13.496 --> 01:35:14.473
SAM: It's great.

01:35:14.473 --> 01:35:16.050
LIAM: That's it, it's gone.

01:35:16.050 --> 01:35:28.162
SAM: Okay. Oh, we've got a lot of dudes here,
right? Bonus action, I'm going to whisper a solemn

01:35:28.162 --> 01:35:31.715
prayer and cast the Rite of the Frozen on my
weapon.

01:35:31.715 --> 01:35:33.093
LIAM: All right.

01:35:33.093 --> 01:35:39.277
LAURA: Okay, can I ask you a question? So our
rites, can we do that every turn?

01:35:39.277 --> 01:35:48.745
LIAM: It lasts twice a day. You can make either
your claw or your blade have that extra arcane

01:35:48.745 --> 01:35:51.729
energy to it, and then it lasts-- I forget how
long.

01:35:51.729 --> 01:35:55.705
SAM: It lasts until you-- shit. Until a rest?

01:35:55.705 --> 01:35:57.255
LAURA and ERICA: Until you shit?

01:35:57.255 --> 01:35:59.242
SAM: I'll look it up, you just DM.

01:35:59.242 --> 01:36:05.978
LIAM: Okay, great. Just don't do it if you're a
lavender tiefling with three hit points, that's

01:36:05.978 --> 01:36:08.116
the only rule. Don't do it then.

01:36:08.183 --> 01:36:09.311
ERICA: Great.

01:36:09.311 --> 01:36:11.315
SAM: Oh, I take six points of damage.

01:36:11.426 --> 01:36:12.932
LIAM: That's right.

01:36:12.932 --> 01:36:16.595
SAM: Yep. From casting the rite. That's it, that's
my move.

01:36:16.595 --> 01:36:20.033
LIAM: Okay. Now we're onto Lawrence.

01:36:20.033 --> 01:36:25.783
TRAVIS: I see my brother and sister making such
quick work of whatever these creatures are, and

01:36:25.783 --> 01:36:28.080
I'll run towards this front gate.

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:29.633
LIAM: It's open.

01:36:29.633 --> 01:36:31.945
TRAVIS: I would hope so, but I burst through
dramatically.

01:36:31.945 --> 01:36:33.700
LIAM: (clanging)

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:36.199
TRAVIS: I will attack that first beastie in front
of me.

01:36:36.199 --> 01:36:39.058
LIAM: All right, go for it.

01:36:39.058 --> 01:36:40.760
TRAVIS: That is a 15.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.497
LIAM: That does, in fact, hit.

01:36:42.497 --> 01:36:50.282
TRAVIS: Nice! Oh, it's actually 16, sorry. That is
a one. Four points of damage.

01:36:50.282 --> 01:36:53.145
LIAM: Four points of damage. Shortsword, right?

01:36:53.145 --> 01:36:54.375
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:59.024
LIAM: You take your sword and you jam it right
through its hips, trying to take it apart at the

01:36:59.024 --> 01:37:03.847
legs. You've seen how easy it was for everybody to
do what they did. The hip breaks off, and the leg

01:37:03.847 --> 01:37:09.196
shutters, but it (growling) turns around towards
you, still moving.

01:37:09.196 --> 01:37:14.849
TRAVIS: That's embarrassing. Second attack. That
is a 19 to hit.

01:37:14.849 --> 01:37:22.516
LIAM: You see it coming around and raising its own
rusted, old blade. You take your other shortsword

01:37:22.516 --> 01:37:29.026
and swing it at the neck, and the head goes pop,
flies in the air and bounces and rolls into a hole

01:37:29.026 --> 01:37:31.152
in the ground and scutters away into a grave.

01:37:31.152 --> 01:37:39.385
TRAVIS: Excellent. (singing) Bonus, do I want to
do anything? And I want to just stay there because

01:37:39.385 --> 01:37:46.373
of you. (speaking) Actually, yes, I'll use the rest of movement to come within melee of caped bastard.

01:37:46.373 --> 01:37:49.459
SAM: It lasts until your next short or long rest.

01:37:49.733 --> 01:37:51.350
LAURA: Oh shit, really?

01:37:51.381 --> 01:37:52.598
TRAVIS: What's that?

01:37:52.598 --> 01:37:56.612
SAM: The rite. It goes until we take a rest.

01:37:56.612 --> 01:38:04.132
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action to imbue my
shortswords with fire damage, and I will take

01:38:04.226 --> 01:38:05.376
negative six.

01:38:05.376 --> 01:38:07.337
LAURA: I think you only can do one of the swords,
I don't think you can do both.

01:38:07.337 --> 01:38:08.525
LIAM: That's correct.

01:38:08.525 --> 01:38:10.461
TRAVIS: The one in my right hand, okay?

01:38:10.461 --> 01:38:11.837
LIAM: But one at a time.

01:38:11.837 --> 01:38:13.266
TRAVIS: Right, not the stranger.

01:38:13.266 --> 01:38:19.068
TJ: While all of this is happening, can I speak to
her because we're watching all of this?

01:38:19.068 --> 01:38:22.065
LIAM: If it's quick, yeah, sure.

01:38:22.065 --> 01:38:23.611
SAM: Three seconds.

01:38:23.611 --> 01:38:30.663
TJ: There is magic here, sister. Know that, find the 
one doing the magic, that is the only one that matters.

01:38:30.689 --> 01:38:32.901
ERICA: Yes, brother, I know.

01:38:32.945 --> 01:38:37.826
LIAM: Now we're on our strangers. The one with the
long, brown hair-- handsome if he wasn't covered

01:38:37.826 --> 01:38:43.223
in filth-- backs up here and gets into this corner.
Leering and smiling and holding that censer

01:38:44.756 --> 01:38:57.478
hanging from a chain and you hear him mutter,
"Go, go!" This one does the same, creeps around,

01:38:57.496 --> 01:39:02.933
pushing backwards, eyeing you guys as he goes. He
moves back into this corner holding the censer

01:39:03.084 --> 01:39:23.241
aloft, and as he moves back, he yells out, "Ray.
Ray!" Portia, what is your armor class?

01:39:23.241 --> 01:39:25.379
LAURA: It is 16.

01:39:25.379 --> 01:39:39.445
LIAM: Okay. You feel a crossbow bolt sink between
your shoulder blades. You take 13 points of

01:39:39.445 --> 01:39:40.989
piercing damage.

01:39:40.989 --> 01:39:42.313
LAURA: What the fuck?

01:39:42.313 --> 01:39:51.159
LIAM: Looking over your shoulder, you see a woman,
a very ropey, ragged, red-haired woman, standing

01:39:51.159 --> 01:40:00.642
at a perch on top, hiding, somewhat obscured
behind this-- Ah! She's dead. On this spire up top.

01:40:00.642 --> 01:40:10.093
She is wearing a ragged vest, and there's a hood,
a very wet cloak over her bare arms holding her

01:40:10.133 --> 01:40:12.871
crossbow, and she's leering down at you.

01:40:12.871 --> 01:40:15.076
LAURA: That's a lot of damage.

01:40:15.076 --> 01:40:17.334
LIAM: Now it is the skeletons' turns.

01:40:17.334 --> 01:40:19.794
SAM: You got hit, Portia?

01:40:19.794 --> 01:40:21.145
LAURA: Yeah.

01:40:21.145 --> 01:40:29.414
LIAM: Here's what happens. This one-- (counting)--
I'm going to move things first. So this

01:40:29.505 --> 01:40:35.371
happens, this happens. Since there's so many--
This one is actually stuck in the ground, and it's

01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:43.043
going like, (rattling), reaching out towards you,
Lawrence. This one steps into Portia. This one

01:40:43.043 --> 01:40:54.221
also steps over to Lawrence, but this one closes
in and starts moving dumbly towards this man in

01:40:54.221 --> 01:41:02.957
the corner. So does this one. So does this one.
They just start converging on this guy.

01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:04.922
SAM: Are they going to attack him?

01:41:04.922 --> 01:41:12.692
LIAM: He's stuck. Same thing's happening over
here. This one moves in, and as that's happening,

01:41:12.692 --> 01:41:24.209
you see looks of confusion and pants-shitting fear
on their faces as they're suddenly surrounded by

01:41:24.209 --> 01:41:30.802
the dead, but we'll get to them. Over here, we've
got three skeletons converging on Lawrence, and

01:41:30.802 --> 01:41:33.209
Lawrence, your AC is 16.

01:41:33.209 --> 01:41:34.726
TRAVIS: That's correct.

01:41:34.726 --> 01:41:36.746
SAM: You better wolf out there.

01:41:36.746 --> 01:41:44.424
LIAM: The first two swing dumbly at you, and
they're not that fast. They're terrifying; they're

01:41:44.424 --> 01:41:49.951
covered and streaked in mud and 50- to
200-year-old weapons in hand. But they're slow,

01:41:49.951 --> 01:41:56.330
and the first two swing at you, and you very
easily dodge out of the way. The last one does,

01:41:56.330 --> 01:42:04.738
while you're busy with those two, manage to score
a hit on you, and you take four points of slashing

01:42:04.738 --> 01:42:11.534
damage as you feel an old, rusted blade bite into
your back. Over here with Portia, it's not bad;

01:42:11.534 --> 01:42:13.492
it's just one.

01:42:13.492 --> 01:42:15.000
SAM: Watch out, Porsh.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.081
LIAM: That's an 18; also hits. You take eight
points of slashing damage.

01:42:20.081 --> 01:42:21.494
LAURA: What the fuck? Ah!

01:42:21.494 --> 01:42:26.909
LIAM: Cuts into your arm, and you feel it gets
through some of the scales where two pieces of

01:42:26.915 --> 01:42:29.221
scale armor meet here. It gets right in that
wedge.

01:42:29.221 --> 01:42:30.932
SAM: What's wrong with you? I said watch out.

01:42:30.932 --> 01:42:32.067
LAURA: Thanks, Benny.

01:42:32.067 --> 01:42:38.858
LIAM: Then, in the corner, as they both start to
go, "Wha-- What?" One, two, three.

01:42:38.858 --> 01:42:42.098
SAM: Are they just bad at this spell?

01:42:42.098 --> 01:42:47.867
ERICA: Clearly. They're not winning at this.

01:42:47.917 --> 01:43:02.542
LIAM: Hits. Misses, misses. Okay, over on this
side, we see two skeletons converging, and run

01:43:02.542 --> 01:43:10.639
this guy through with old blades. He looks
terrified, and white as a ghost as two old blades

01:43:10.639 --> 01:43:15.894
go (slicing) (spluttering). He spits, and a glob
of blood flies out of his mouth. He is still on

01:43:15.894 --> 01:43:23.417
his feet, though. Over on this side, we get--

01:43:23.417 --> 01:43:26.878
TRAVIS: We better beat that bitch up top, I'm just
saying.

01:43:26.878 --> 01:43:37.629
LIAM: Same over here. This guy is converged on as
well, and you hear him scream out in a high tenor,

01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:44.818
and he takes a wedge out of the side of him with a
sword. He doesn't do as badly as his friend over

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:48.924
there, but he is damaged as well. Damage for the
second is-- Okay.

01:43:48.924 --> 01:43:53.845
SAM: I think the skeletons are on our side, guys.

01:43:53.845 --> 01:44:01.267
LIAM: Now we are on Aurra. Wolven Aurra, what
would you like to do?

01:44:01.267 --> 01:44:07.772
ERICA: Can I Entangle from the angle that I'm at
to the woman on the-- Actually, can I see the

01:44:07.772 --> 01:44:09.110
woman on the roof?

01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:11.286
LIAM: You can see her.

01:44:11.286 --> 01:44:13.306
ERICA: So I have acknowledged that she's present?

01:44:13.306 --> 01:44:18.158
LIAM: Yeah, she made herself known. She threw a
tarp off of herself. She was in a little perch up

01:44:18.158 --> 01:44:21.600
there. So you want to use Grasping Vines?

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.466
ERICA: I would like to use those, if I could.
Coming up-- It's Entangle, it just--

01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:28.045
SAM: It's Entangle, yeah.

01:44:28.045 --> 01:44:31.624
LAURA: Entangle might have to be on the ground.

01:44:31.624 --> 01:44:35.618
ERICA: I mean, it's from the ground. But it
doesn't specify the height of the vine.

01:44:35.618 --> 01:44:37.023
SAM: That's true.

01:44:37.032 --> 01:44:40.101
ERICA: So I could wrap around the entire
structure.

01:44:40.101 --> 01:44:44.135
LIAM: What's your spell DC, you want to remind me
of that? It's on your character page, in the

01:44:44.244 --> 01:44:47.113
bottom-right hand corner where I wrote it for you
there.

01:44:47.113 --> 01:44:48.068
SAM and ERICA: 15.

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:58.881
LIAM: 15. It's strength, right? Numbers, numbers,
numbers.

01:44:58.881 --> 01:45:00.418
ERICA: Entangle.

01:45:00.418 --> 01:45:09.295
LIAM: Vines burst out of the stone, out of the
little cracks where barely any soil exists, but it

01:45:09.295 --> 01:45:16.756
still manages to crawl and grow and expand and
twist around her. She sees it and manages to push

01:45:16.756 --> 01:45:25.866
and pull away and jump over to this side. She is
<i>not</i> restrained. She managed to pull it off of

01:45:25.866 --> 01:45:35.649
her legs and get free of it. There is a huge patch
of vines-- well, we didn't specify where it was,

01:45:35.751 --> 01:45:38.754
so she <i>is</i> surrounded by them, but she's still
holding her own.

01:45:38.754 --> 01:45:39.895
ERICA: Okay.

01:45:39.895 --> 01:45:43.837
LIAM: The vines are still there. Lucius, it's your
turn.

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:47.283
SAM: She can still move, right? You. Yes.

01:45:47.283 --> 01:45:49.888
ERICA: If she moves, she's fucked, is what--

01:45:49.888 --> 01:45:55.621
SAM: Yes. You can also move if you wanted to move
your person over there.

01:45:55.801 --> 01:46:04.487
ERICA: Question. Do I cross that off, now that
I've--

01:46:04.487 --> 01:46:06.027
LIAM: That is a spell slot, yes.

01:46:06.027 --> 01:46:13.984
ERICA: That is a spell that I have used. Great.
Okay. Cool. Done. I'm doing it, I'm doing the things.

01:46:14.038 --> 01:46:15.181
SAM: You are.

01:46:15.181 --> 01:46:20.951
ERICA: Okay. Great. Could I-- (sighs) Don't want
to use that. Shoot. I'm up. But I do. Can I Haste?

01:46:20.951 --> 01:46:23.454
LAURA: Oh, you can only do one spell per--

01:46:23.541 --> 01:46:26.444
ERICA: One spell per. Thank you. Then I can just
take an action?

01:46:26.444 --> 01:46:29.716
LIAM: You can move right now. That <i>was</i> your
action. If you want to a different position--

01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:33.539
ERICA: Okay. Ugh. I mean, I would go after her.

01:46:33.539 --> 01:46:34.854
TRAVIS: Yeah, you would.

01:46:34.854 --> 01:46:42.426
LIAM: You could get over the building. I would say
climbing up would be your action, because that's a

01:46:42.426 --> 01:46:43.702
very involved thing--

01:46:43.783 --> 01:46:45.410
ERICA: That would be a separate action? So I run
to the building--

01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:50.824
LIAM: You can use your movement to leap through
this. All right, so your hulking, now fur-lined

01:46:50.824 --> 01:46:55.449
body streaks through this gap in the fence and
gets to the bottom and looking up at the edge

01:46:55.449 --> 01:47:01.560
which is 15 feet high. Not too terrible for you,
but it's up there. You're waiting. Lucius.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.272
TJ: Moonweaver.

01:47:03.272 --> 01:47:04.978
(laughter)

01:47:04.978 --> 01:47:09.552
TJ: Please teach her the curse of our family.
Sacred Flame.

01:47:09.552 --> 01:47:11.256
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:47:11.256 --> 01:47:15.858
TJ: That's a saving throw, dexterity.

01:47:15.858 --> 01:47:17.428
LIAM: Okay.

01:47:17.428 --> 01:47:19.590
TJ: Versus 15, please.

01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:21.294
LIAM: She does not make that.

01:47:21.294 --> 01:47:23.745
TJ: If she fails it, then she will also get the
Mark of Waning.

01:47:23.745 --> 01:47:26.635
LIAM: Ooh, what does that do? Remind me.

01:47:26.635 --> 01:47:28.185
TJ: The moon domain's--

01:47:28.185 --> 01:47:29.734
SAM: Because it's raining?

01:47:29.734 --> 01:47:32.276
(laughter)

01:47:32.276 --> 01:47:33.984
TRAVIS: Wonderful.

01:47:33.984 --> 01:47:39.091
TJ: The creature's speed is halved, and it has
disadvantage on strength ability checks until the

01:47:39.091 --> 01:47:40.823
end of its next turn.

01:47:40.823 --> 01:47:42.550
LIAM: Roll for radiant damage, 1d8, on her?

01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:46.473
TJ: Three.

01:47:46.473 --> 01:47:47.864
LIAM: Three, okay.

01:47:47.864 --> 01:47:49.224
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:47:49.224 --> 01:47:51.680
LIAM: All right. We are back up to Portia. Where
you at, girl?

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:53.033
LAURA: Oh me?

01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:54.981
SAM: Yeah. Rev those engines.

01:47:54.981 --> 01:48:00.493
LAURA: I want to kill this-- oh, wait, first I'm going
to Crimson Rite my sword! Wait, should I,

01:48:00.701 --> 01:48:02.449
though? Because my hit points are pretty fucking
low already.

01:48:02.449 --> 01:48:04.585
SAM: Yeah, come on, pull a Taliesin. Let's do it.

01:48:05.073 --> 01:48:07.485
LAURA: Ugh, I'm going to Crimson Rite my sword!

01:48:07.485 --> 01:48:09.738
LIAM: You take six hex-- hix points.

01:48:09.738 --> 01:48:11.390
LAURA: Hix points.

01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:13.457
LIAM: (southern accent) Like them hix points!

01:48:13.457 --> 01:48:20.677
LAURA: I want to do fire damage. I've seen my
brother do it, and I do it too. Okay.

01:48:20.677 --> 01:48:23.427
LIAM: Okay. So--

01:48:23.427 --> 01:48:24.957
TRAVIS: Then what?

01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:27.082
LAURA: I'm going to hit this skeleton, I guess.

01:48:27.082 --> 01:48:32.524
TRAVIS: (southern accented) Sho' nuff! The Lorelei
family's been in these woods for a long time.

01:48:32.530 --> 01:48:35.061
LIAM: Her ear is wreathed in flame now.

01:48:35.061 --> 01:48:36.556
LAURA: 18.

01:48:36.556 --> 01:48:37.906
LIAM: 18 hits.

01:48:38.023 --> 01:48:43.678
LAURA: What do I add for my-- do I add six to the
damage now?

01:48:43.678 --> 01:48:44.817
LIAM: Yes.

01:48:44.817 --> 01:48:45.940
LAURA: Really?

01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:46.894
LIAM: It's a d6.

01:48:46.894 --> 01:48:48.028
LAURA: Awesome.

01:48:48.028 --> 01:48:51.259
LIAM: You got your plus two from your longsword.

01:48:51.259 --> 01:48:52.753
LAURA: 16 points of damage.

01:48:52.753 --> 01:48:59.809
LIAM: 16 points of damage? The skeleton erupts in
flame. It does a small mini explosion in the night

01:48:59.809 --> 01:49:06.113
here. Sparks fall, bone fragments fall to the
ground. It is gone. You can still move.

01:49:06.113 --> 01:49:09.280
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to run over to my
brother--

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.704
LIAM: This one here?

01:49:10.704 --> 01:49:12.277
LAURA: No, not that one. The other one.

01:49:12.277 --> 01:49:13.473
TRAVIS: Your favorite brother.

01:49:13.473 --> 01:49:14.460
LAURA: My weakling brother.

01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:16.070
LIAM: Do you want to flank this one or-- where you
want to go?

01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:19.086
LAURA: I'm going to go-- the one-- at his back.

01:49:19.086 --> 01:49:23.331
LIAM: Yeah? Flanking? All right. Advantage on
that, then.

01:49:23.331 --> 01:49:31.803
LAURA: Sweet, and I'm going to try to hit him.
Good thing there's advantage. 14 plus nine, so

01:49:31.803 --> 01:49:33.377
that hits.

01:49:33.377 --> 01:49:34.603
LIAM: Yes, it does.

01:49:34.679 --> 01:49:38.336
TRAVIS: Extra d6.

01:49:38.336 --> 01:49:40.809
LAURA: I did it. 18.

01:49:40.809 --> 01:49:42.509
LIAM: Oh, man.

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:43.646
SAM: Rough.

01:49:43.646 --> 01:49:49.363
LIAM: You bring it right through the thing's
spinal cord, the ribs go (cracking) break. Again,

01:49:49.363 --> 01:49:56.508
little fireworks flying, it breaks in half and
both the halves go flying off in this direction,

01:49:56.508 --> 01:50:01.834
scuttle across the ground, land on the puddle, and
steam (hissing) out after being--

01:50:01.834 --> 01:50:03.534
TRAVIS: Thanks for that, sister.

01:50:03.534 --> 01:50:07.691
LIAM: Now we are on to-- is that the end of your
turn? You get all your stuff in?

01:50:07.691 --> 01:50:08.585
LAURA: (whispering) That's the end of my turn.

01:50:08.585 --> 01:50:09.368
LIAM: Benicio.

01:50:09.368 --> 01:50:11.414
SAM: I will yell out--

01:50:11.414 --> 01:50:14.106
LAURA: Oh, wait! Do I have any movement left?

01:50:14.282 --> 01:50:15.729
LIAM: You can go five more feet, I'll give you.

01:50:15.729 --> 01:50:21.881
LAURA: I want to step on the-- no, to where the
stone is blocking me to that stupid girl on the roof.

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:23.983
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, cover it.

01:50:23.983 --> 01:50:25.323
LIAM: Oh, nice. Yeah, real nice.

01:50:25.323 --> 01:50:37.417
SAM: I will yell out, "Lawrence!" With my twin rage,
I will run towards him as fast as I can. When I get there--

01:50:37.428 --> 01:50:38.983
LAURA: Tell me that's going to get a swipe!

01:50:38.983 --> 01:50:40.492
SAM: Oh, is that thing going to get a swipe on
me?

01:50:40.492 --> 01:50:41.804
LIAM: Which way are you going?

01:50:41.804 --> 01:50:42.776
SAM: I'm going right past him.

01:50:42.776 --> 01:50:43.738
LIAM: Here?

01:50:43.738 --> 01:50:46.957
SAM: I want to get up in the face of the people
that my brother is fighting.

01:50:46.957 --> 01:50:48.099
TRAVIS: The cloaked ones?

01:50:48.099 --> 01:50:50.546
LIAM: It's (counting) 20, you can go two more. You
can go--

01:50:50.546 --> 01:50:54.973
SAM: Sure, but is the guy-- the fucker on the
ground going to get a swipe at me?

01:50:54.973 --> 01:50:56.133
LIAM: You don't know.

01:50:56.133 --> 01:50:58.225
SAM: Okay. Yeah, I'll keep going--

01:50:58.225 --> 01:51:02.607
LIAM: To where? Here? I'll let you stand atop that
fallen gravestone of your ancestors if you want.

01:51:02.607 --> 01:51:08.625
SAM: Sure. Well, I want to get in range of both of
the people who are attacking Lawrence.

01:51:08.641 --> 01:51:14.331
LIAM: Okay, all right. So (counting) 25.

01:51:14.712 --> 01:51:19.261
SAM: Stop there, and I'll attack the first. I
can always after I kill him--

01:51:19.261 --> 01:51:22.779
LIAM: You got two targets if you want. Go
for it. Roll for attack.

01:51:22.779 --> 01:51:25.178
SAM: I'll attack the imposing guy--

01:51:25.314 --> 01:51:26.695
LIAM: This one with a spear.

01:51:26.695 --> 01:51:28.085
SAM: 20 to hit.

01:51:28.085 --> 01:51:29.235
LIAM: That hits.

01:51:29.235 --> 01:51:37.423
SAM: I've got my frozen damage activated. Whoa.
16 points of damage, some of that is cold damage.

01:51:37.449 --> 01:51:42.093
LAURA: Do the undead-- wait. Are they... do undead
take cold damage, are they--

01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:43.197
SAM: I don't know.

01:51:43.214 --> 01:51:49.741
LIAM: They do. The halberd, you smash into his giant spear, knocks the spear out of its bony hand and

01:51:49.865 --> 01:51:54.802
then the halberd keeps going. Smashes down into
his shoulder, and ice fragments go (spurting) and

01:51:54.802 --> 01:52:02.765
fuse all the bones together. Hardens the thing's
cape in ice, and it teeters over,

01:52:02.793 --> 01:52:09.133
falls to the ground and breaks into two pieces of
frozen skeleton pop. So that one is gone.

01:52:09.133 --> 01:52:12.310
SAM: All right. I can't move any closer to the
other dudes.

01:52:12.349 --> 01:52:16.631
LIAM: You could go five more feet, if
you wanted to.

01:52:16.631 --> 01:52:18.573
SAM: I mean, would that get me in with the other
skeletor?

01:52:18.671 --> 01:52:24.521
LIAM: This one? Yeah. Okay, this one goes (guttural
hissing) and sticks his blade out at your ankle.

01:52:24.521 --> 01:52:34.324
He's stuck up to his bony navel, so it does not
hit you. Strikes nothing. Strikes the ground.

01:52:34.353 --> 01:52:39.288
SAM: Not so fast, little man. I will attack the
other skeleton.

01:52:39.288 --> 01:52:41.596
LIAM: Yes. Go for it.

01:52:41.596 --> 01:52:45.135
SAM: I got you, bro! 22 to hit.

01:52:45.135 --> 01:52:46.882
LIAM: That hits.

01:52:46.882 --> 01:52:49.821
SAM: 11 points of damage.

01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:53.426
LIAM: Okay. You take your halberd in your hand,
overhand like this, you walk over to it and you go

01:52:53.426 --> 01:53:00.585
(impact) knock it right in the skull and the skull
caves in and fills in like sno-cone. Ice fills the

01:53:00.585 --> 01:53:06.227
thing's skull. The head gets heavy and drags the
whole body down and falls into the mud.

01:53:06.227 --> 01:53:10.311
LAURA: I'm standing right there, got a real good
view of it, and I start (slow clapping).

01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:14.034
SAM: As a bonus action? I'd like to noogie my
brother.

01:53:14.034 --> 01:53:15.229
LIAM: I will allow it.

01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:16.554
TRAVIS: No!

01:53:16.554 --> 01:53:18.223
SAM: (grunting) Two for flinching!

01:53:18.223 --> 01:53:21.693
TRAVIS: (sputtering) Get off me!

01:53:21.697 --> 01:53:24.515
LIAM: Coming off of that embarrassing noogie, what
do you do, Lawrence?

01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:31.435
TRAVIS: I go over to the man in the ground and
strike him verily.

01:53:31.435 --> 01:53:33.572
SAM: Fisticuffs?

01:53:33.572 --> 01:53:36.105
LIAM: I'm going to give you advantage on that.

01:53:36.105 --> 01:53:40.427
TRAVIS: Shit! Better! 17!

01:53:40.427 --> 01:53:42.153
LIAM: 17 hits.

01:53:42.153 --> 01:53:46.555
TRAVIS: 13 with flame damage.

01:53:46.555 --> 01:53:49.413
LIAM: I'm going to say for flair--

01:53:49.413 --> 01:53:50.803
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's on fire!

01:53:50.803 --> 01:53:51.919
SAM: Your fist is on fire?

01:53:51.919 --> 01:53:54.456
TRAVIS: No, my shortsword. (tock)

01:53:54.481 --> 01:53:58.072
LIAM: Just because it's fun, I'm going to say you
come at this thing with your shortswords and go,

01:53:58.229 --> 01:54:03.111
"Eh," flip it around to the pommels and go
(impact) and nail its skull from both sides and it

01:54:03.111 --> 01:54:11.518
brittle-- breaks into fragments and the arm goes
(faint gurgling) and falls still.

01:54:11.518 --> 01:54:16.194
TRAVIS: Thanks for the noogie. You might want to
duck. I'll use the rest of my movement to take

01:54:16.194 --> 01:54:19.790
cover behind that pillar, echoing what Portia is
doing as well.

01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:24.086
LIAM: Okay. The stranger's turn.

01:54:24.086 --> 01:54:26.558
SAM: (whispering) Wrong guy.

01:54:26.558 --> 01:54:37.811
LIAM: Oh, yeah, well. You're twins. What do I want
to do? The one that looks like a ragged hippie

01:54:37.825 --> 01:54:47.135
over here throws down the chain and starts to try
to climb up on the wall, and they all lay into him

01:54:47.135 --> 01:55:06.092
again. (counting) They all stab him in the back
very heavily. He takes it into the small of his

01:55:06.151 --> 01:55:17.208
back, in between his shoulder blades. He screams
out in pain. He falls down on the ground, gets

01:55:17.208 --> 01:55:19.611
back up, and starts moving.

01:55:19.611 --> 01:55:22.911
LAURA: He got stabbed in the back four fucking
times and he still ran away?

01:55:22.911 --> 01:55:24.445
TRAVIS: He tough.

01:55:24.445 --> 01:55:34.868
LIAM: Then over there, this guy goes, "Ray! Help
me out here, Ray!" He's not going to go down-- oh,

01:55:35.028 --> 01:55:41.816
yeah, he is. He rushes forward with the blade that
he's holding and tries to shove it into the

01:55:41.816 --> 01:55:49.195
skeleton and actually runs into the adjacent
skeleton's blade and gets stabbed in his own gut.

01:55:49.195 --> 01:56:07.845
He's freaking out and panicking. He starts to try
to climb up, rethinking his decision. Okay. He

01:56:07.845 --> 01:56:14.457
screams out pitifully. You've gone from hatred to
a brief moment of pity because he sounds like a

01:56:14.516 --> 01:56:19.227
wounded animal, stumbling over, climbs up.

01:56:19.585 --> 01:56:21.642
SAM: Wow, this guy's tough.

01:56:21.642 --> 01:56:24.031
LIAM: This one moves--

01:56:24.031 --> 01:56:25.839
LAURA: Entanglement!

01:56:25.839 --> 01:56:27.600
LIAM: Yeah. She makes a--

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.197
TJ: Half strength.

01:56:29.197 --> 01:56:32.127
LIAM: Half strength, right. So it's a
disadvantage. She is stuck.

01:56:32.127 --> 01:56:33.746
SAM: Hey, you got it!

01:56:33.746 --> 01:56:41.956
LIAM: But can still attack. Can't see the werewolf
that she just saw running down the side, but she

01:56:41.956 --> 01:56:46.184
does see the Moonweaver's chosen. So she fires at
him.

01:56:46.184 --> 01:56:48.156
TRAVIS: Death!

01:56:48.156 --> 01:56:58.999
LIAM: Your armor class is 16. She gets-- She
misses. The crossbow strikes the wrought-iron

01:56:58.999 --> 01:57:02.394
fence and clatters to the ground, and she is stuck
there.

01:57:02.394 --> 01:57:04.564
TJ: The Moonweaver protects me.

01:57:04.564 --> 01:57:06.719
(laughter)

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:10.514
SAM: So holier-than-thou.

01:57:10.514 --> 01:57:12.500
TRAVIS: So entitled!

01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:20.400
SAM: (like Lucius) Have you heard the good
word?

01:57:20.448 --> 01:57:25.268
TRAVIS: (singing) Hello, my name is--

01:57:25.268 --> 01:57:28.412
(laughter)

01:57:28.412 --> 01:57:33.198
LIAM: Sorry, Travis.

01:57:33.198 --> 01:57:35.539
SAM: They're all leaving.

01:57:35.539 --> 01:57:37.107
LAURA: Yeah, let them run.

01:57:37.107 --> 01:57:39.056
TRAVIS: That's okay. They chasing that incense.

01:57:39.056 --> 01:57:41.521
SAM: They belong in a museum.

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:47.565
TRAVIS: They chasing that Nag Champa. Whatever's
in that shit. I mean, they've got to be drawn to

01:57:47.565 --> 01:57:48.984
it, right?

01:57:48.984 --> 01:57:54.451
LAURA: Yeah. But-- so they're going after him?
It's because they're our ancestors. They know who

01:57:54.451 --> 01:57:56.017
the enemy is.

01:57:56.017 --> 01:57:57.578
TRAVIS: I don't know about that.

01:57:57.578 --> 01:57:59.491
SAM: Who's the lady on top?

01:57:59.491 --> 01:58:01.125
TRAVIS: We're going to find out, though.

01:58:01.125 --> 01:58:02.714
SAM: Are we going to kill her?

01:58:02.714 --> 01:58:06.870
TRAVIS: We're going to talk to her first. As long
as they keep running, we're good.

01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:18.568
LIAM: All right, that guy is pushed down to the
ground and run through by three of them standing

01:58:18.568 --> 01:58:20.499
around and stabbing away.

01:58:20.499 --> 01:58:22.821
TRAVIS: He dead.

01:58:22.821 --> 01:58:25.932
LIAM: Over on this side we've got--

01:58:25.966 --> 01:58:27.434
TRAVIS: He chose--

01:58:27.434 --> 01:58:28.716
TRAVIS and TJ: Poorly.

01:58:28.716 --> 01:58:37.711
LIAM: Yes. No. Shit, that guy missed. No.
Okay, so.

01:58:37.846 --> 01:58:42.756
SAM: You're rolling for all these guys. Liam,
you're such a fair play.

01:58:42.756 --> 01:58:45.241
LIAM: That guy's dead too.

01:58:45.241 --> 01:58:47.077
LAURA: (triumphant laugh)

01:58:47.077 --> 01:58:52.570
LIAM: He is ripped apart and you see one of them
turning its sword upside down and sawing into the

01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:54.126
back of his neck.

01:58:54.126 --> 01:58:56.520
TRAVIS: Are they on the other side of the fence,
now?

01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:01.132
LIAM: Some have climbed over that little wall there.
That's right.

01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:02.862
TRAVIS: We won't have long.

01:59:02.862 --> 01:59:04.603
LIAM: That's it for them, now Aurra is up.

01:59:04.603 --> 01:59:05.787
SAM: All right, Aurra.

01:59:05.787 --> 01:59:09.602
ERICA: I go to launch myself onto the roof.

01:59:09.602 --> 01:59:12.534
LIAM: Okay, make an athletics check.

01:59:12.534 --> 01:59:14.287
SAM: She's a wolf.

01:59:14.287 --> 01:59:15.437
LIAM: I know.

01:59:15.437 --> 01:59:17.171
SAM: I don't know what that means.

01:59:17.171 --> 01:59:26.590
ERICA: Athletics, athletics. Shit. 14?

01:59:26.623 --> 01:59:29.007
SAM: Oh, wait, but it says wolf, add two.

01:59:29.007 --> 01:59:30.697
ERICA: Is that wolf, or-- yes it is.

01:59:30.697 --> 01:59:32.975
LIAM: You're already good. She succeeds.

01:59:32.975 --> 01:59:34.464
ERICA: 16. Oh, we're good.

01:59:34.464 --> 01:59:40.031
LIAM: Leaps, claws grab the lip of the roof, and
you yank yourself up. You actually fly a good

01:59:40.124 --> 01:59:45.592
three feet higher than you need to and then land.
Your clawed feet clutch into the ground, and you

01:59:45.592 --> 01:59:47.190
are now staring at your prey.

01:59:47.190 --> 01:59:51.252
TJ: Fuck him up!

01:59:51.252 --> 01:59:57.466
LIAM: You used your action to get up there, but
you could still, as a bonus action, claw.

01:59:57.466 --> 01:59:59.013
ERICA: Can I use a--

01:59:59.013 --> 02:00:03.150
LIAM: The action was to hoist yourself up to the
top of the roof, but you have a bonus action left

02:00:03.150 --> 02:00:05.295
which you could use to take a swipe if you want.

02:00:05.295 --> 02:00:07.854
ERICA: But I couldn't-- can I use a spell-type
thing if I have one?

02:00:07.854 --> 02:00:09.225
LIAM: If it's a bonus action you can.

02:00:09.225 --> 02:00:10.576
ERICA: If I have a bonus action.

02:00:10.576 --> 02:00:12.177
SAM: You can heal her.

02:00:12.190 --> 02:00:19.113
ERICA: There's this one, but it's not helpful. I
go toward her to--

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:21.162
SAM: Claw her to death.

02:00:21.162 --> 02:00:27.437
ERICA: No, to grab her. Violently. Yes, well,
the body, throat. Head.

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.973
SAM: Rip off her head.

02:00:29.191 --> 02:00:31.238
ERICA: Restraint. Full restraint. I do not rip off
her head. We need to know more!

02:00:31.238 --> 02:00:32.575
SAM: Restrain her head by ripping it off.

02:00:32.618 --> 02:00:36.301
LIAM: I would say that that's too much, the best
you could do is get right up on her business or

02:00:36.301 --> 02:00:43.961
slash her as a bonus action. Because these run in
six second chunks, and you've taken most of that

02:00:44.028 --> 02:00:45.800
time to go (exertion noises).

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.176
LAURA: But she could stand up right next to her.

02:00:47.181 --> 02:00:49.036
TJ: Can she grab her? Grapple?

02:00:49.036 --> 02:00:51.203
LIAM: Not after hoisting herself up, I'm going to
say.

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:53.199
ERICA: Can I slash at her to trip her?

02:00:53.199 --> 02:00:58.897
LIAM: Well she's held by vines at the moment. You
can at disadvantage.

02:00:58.897 --> 02:01:00.423
SAM: Do it.

02:01:00.423 --> 02:01:01.807
ERICA: At disadvantage.

02:01:01.807 --> 02:01:03.530
LIAM: You can use your attack.

02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:14.161
ERICA: Okay, that's a nine. That's an 18. Damn
it.

02:01:14.667 --> 02:01:16.103
LIAM: So take the nine. Is it nine total?

02:01:16.103 --> 02:01:17.360
ERICA: Nine plus--

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.812
SAM: What is this, unarmed strike?

02:01:18.812 --> 02:01:20.999
LIAM: Well, I want her to hit her armor class.

02:01:20.999 --> 02:01:25.102
SAM: Wait, so what is she adding to this?

02:01:25.102 --> 02:01:26.187
TRAVIS: Plus strength.

02:01:26.187 --> 02:01:32.484
LIAM: It's an attack. It's the attack bonus next
to her claw, which is like a weapon on her page.

02:01:32.484 --> 02:01:34.115
The center of the page.

02:01:34.115 --> 02:01:35.607
SAM: Plus five.

02:01:35.607 --> 02:01:36.979
ERICA: Oh, thank you. Okay, plus five.

02:01:36.979 --> 02:01:38.479
LAURA: So 14.

02:01:38.479 --> 02:01:46.863
LIAM: You slash your fur-lined claw through the
vines, but it is thick, and you can't even get

02:01:46.863 --> 02:01:52.150
through it, she's so wrapped in. You manage to get
your claw onto her ankle.

02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:54.127
LAURA: Your own spell bested you.

02:01:54.127 --> 02:02:00.993
LIAM: She's too firmly held in place by your own
druidical power. Now, we're onto Lucius.

02:02:00.993 --> 02:02:04.420
SAM: I love Lucy.

02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:10.740
TJ: I see that she has it in hand. Is this woman
attempting to attack again? Has she reloaded the

02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:11.735
crossbow already?

02:02:11.735 --> 02:02:15.411
LIAM: Now she looks like she knows she's about to
done get fucked up.

02:02:15.464 --> 02:02:30.654
TJ: My sister has her. I will move in front of my
siblings. I will get closer with an eye on this. I

02:02:30.654 --> 02:02:33.333
don't want this to turn back on us, and I'm
prepared for that.

02:02:33.333 --> 02:02:36.724
LAURA: Blood. Blood. Blood.

02:02:36.724 --> 02:02:40.466
TJ: I will in the meantime say a prayer.

02:02:40.466 --> 02:02:45.955
LAURA: --pouring out of my shoulder--

02:02:45.955 --> 02:02:47.850
ERICA: Apparently she's bleeding.

02:02:47.850 --> 02:02:49.628
TRAVIS: (sarcastically) You're what? You're
bleeding?

02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:50.783
ERICA: She's bleeding.

02:02:50.783 --> 02:02:52.711
LIAM: (sarcastically) Yeah, it sucks, don't it?

02:02:52.711 --> 02:02:56.922
LAURA: (laughter) I know, when the healer doesn't
want to heal. (devious laughter)

02:02:56.922 --> 02:02:58.586
SAM: What are you going to pray for over there, T?

02:02:58.586 --> 02:03:00.227
LAURA: What are you praying for?

02:03:00.227 --> 02:03:06.606
TJ: I don't like the rain so a clear sky is
perfect. I will pray for a clear sky. Or healing!

02:03:06.606 --> 02:03:08.164
Clear sky.

02:03:08.164 --> 02:03:13.913
(cheering and laughter, applause)

02:03:13.913 --> 02:03:15.385
SAM: (childlike) Bless mama, and papa.

02:03:15.385 --> 02:03:19.585
LIAM: If I could have one wish this Christmas
season, it would be that all the little boys and

02:03:19.585 --> 02:03:20.961
girls of the world...

02:03:20.961 --> 02:03:29.164
TJ: Moonweaver, please see that my family does not
bleed to death this night. Healing Word?

02:03:29.164 --> 02:03:30.888
LIAM: Healing Word.

02:03:30.888 --> 02:03:32.329
SAM: Lucky you.

02:03:32.329 --> 02:03:37.709
TJ: What is my--

02:03:37.709 --> 02:03:39.133
LIAM: I think you just do it, don't you?

02:03:39.133 --> 02:03:42.464
SAM: Yeah, it just happens.

02:03:42.464 --> 02:03:45.202
TJ: I think it's d4 plus three or something?

02:03:45.202 --> 02:03:46.454
LIAM: I got it here.

02:03:46.454 --> 02:03:48.405
TJ: Spellcasting modifier, what is it, seven for
me?

02:03:48.405 --> 02:03:52.775
LIAM: It's 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier. So
1d4 plus five?

02:03:52.775 --> 02:03:53.934
TJ: Ten.

02:03:53.934 --> 02:03:55.291
LAURA: Ten points?

02:03:55.291 --> 02:03:57.329
LIAM: Wait, 1d4 plus --

02:03:57.329 --> 02:03:59.208
TJ: No, sorry. Six...

02:03:59.208 --> 02:04:02.226
LIAM: The best you can do is nine, I think. It's
1d4, and your --

02:04:02.226 --> 02:04:03.423
TJ: Eight! Sorry. Eight.

02:04:03.423 --> 02:04:04.810
LIAM: All righty.

02:04:04.810 --> 02:04:08.145
LAURA: Lucius... thank you.

02:04:08.145 --> 02:04:10.933
TJ: Thank the Moonweaver.

02:04:10.933 --> 02:04:13.285
SAM: I was also hurt.

02:04:13.285 --> 02:04:15.352
LIAM: We are back at the top.

02:04:15.352 --> 02:04:19.559
TJ: That was for all of you, right? Healing Word?

02:04:19.559 --> 02:04:21.808
SAM: No. Healing Word is just for one person.

02:04:21.808 --> 02:04:24.274
LIAM: There's Mass Healing Word, then there's
Healing Word.

02:04:24.274 --> 02:04:25.528
TJ: Oh, right. Thank you.

02:04:25.528 --> 02:04:31.929
LAURA: I know. Obviously. Guidance, guys. I'm
going to--

02:04:31.929 --> 02:04:33.994
SAM: Come on, Sha Sha.

02:04:33.994 --> 02:04:42.820
LAURA: I'm going to walk up to the door of the
crypt.

02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.186
LIAM: Okay.

02:04:44.186 --> 02:04:47.326
SAM: Such a middle child thing to do.

02:04:47.326 --> 02:05:00.595
LIAM: Striding in, you get up and you see a
brazier propped up and sitting behind a giant,

02:05:00.595 --> 02:05:09.982
round iron gate in the floor that is locked as
well, that is pried open and bent and there's a

02:05:09.982 --> 02:05:17.526
crowbar sitting in the corner in here. Marble
stairs lead down and you see the edges of the

02:05:17.526 --> 02:05:22.914
passage disappear. Which you're very familiar
with, obviously.

02:05:22.914 --> 02:05:27.545
LAURA: Right. Shit.

02:05:27.545 --> 02:05:29.842
SAM: (laughter)

02:05:29.842 --> 02:05:39.740
LAURA: Okay. I guess I'm going to run-- try to get
over to the corner and get that green thingy.

02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:40.793
LIAM: Over here?

02:05:40.793 --> 02:05:41.665
LAURA: Yeah.

02:05:41.665 --> 02:05:48.358
LIAM: You went (counting) 20, want to go this
way?

02:05:48.358 --> 02:05:51.263
LAURA: Sure, why not. I can do 40 feet.

02:05:51.263 --> 02:05:54.082
SAM: Whoa, when did you get so fast?

02:05:54.082 --> 02:05:55.977
LAURA: I have skills.

02:05:55.977 --> 02:05:58.604
LIAM: There, you're that far. Anything else?

02:05:58.604 --> 02:06:01.625
LAURA: I'm going to just stand there.

02:06:01.625 --> 02:06:02.713
LIAM: Okay, good.

02:06:02.713 --> 02:06:04.580
SAM: You have an action to dash.

02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:09.328
LAURA: Oh, that's true. I'll go for another 40
feet. Thanks.

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:10.595
LIAM: That's true, okay.

02:06:10.595 --> 02:06:13.170
TRAVIS: I'm sure you didn't do that
intentionally.

02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:15.018
LAURA: Brought dead people to life, if I wanted.

02:06:15.018 --> 02:06:16.369
TRAVIS: You did?

02:06:16.369 --> 02:06:17.866
SAM: Maybe?

02:06:17.866 --> 02:06:20.167
LIAM: Is that where you want to be, or did you not
want me to put you right behind one of the

02:06:20.167 --> 02:06:21.426
skellies?

02:06:21.426 --> 02:06:23.230
LAURA: Yeah, just go there.

02:06:23.230 --> 02:06:33.539
TRAVIS: You just ran into the middle of the
battlefield where all the fucking skeletons are,

02:06:33.539 --> 02:06:35.046
away from everybody.

02:06:35.046 --> 02:06:36.464
LIAM: Okay, Benicio, you're up.

02:06:36.464 --> 02:06:37.639
LAURA: (laughter)

02:06:37.639 --> 02:06:44.696
SAM: I'm looking at my sister running towards
these skeletons and I'm very confused. What are we

02:06:44.696 --> 02:06:45.925
doing?

02:06:45.925 --> 02:06:50.874
TRAVIS: I suppose it's one less share, really, for
the inheritance. Best to let her go.

02:06:50.874 --> 02:07:00.444
SAM: What? All right, I'm going with Portia, I
don't know, seems like she knows what she's

02:07:00.444 --> 02:07:01.395
doing.

02:07:01.395 --> 02:07:02.544
TRAVIS: (shouting) You're going too?!

02:07:02.544 --> 02:07:05.842
SAM: I mean, the nerds can take care of the chick
on the roof, right?

02:07:05.842 --> 02:07:07.242
TJ: Is that-- Am I a nerd?

02:07:07.242 --> 02:07:08.355
SAM: Yes.

02:07:08.355 --> 02:07:11.224
LIAM: You can get to either side of her, on her
left or on her right?

02:07:11.224 --> 02:07:12.466
SAM: On her right.

02:07:12.466 --> 02:07:17.722
LIAM: Okay, going to hold your ground? Got to hold
an action before you move, right?

02:07:17.722 --> 02:07:18.896
SAM: Was it?

02:07:18.896 --> 02:07:19.876
LAURA: Yeah.

02:07:19.876 --> 02:07:20.954
LIAM: Sure.

02:07:20.954 --> 02:07:22.572
LAURA: I don't know, do you-- no!

02:07:22.572 --> 02:07:26.820
LIAM: I don't care. You can hold an action if they
come at you and take a swing.

02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:31.408
SAM: No, I'll just wait.

02:07:31.408 --> 02:07:32.564
LIAM: Okay, great.

02:07:32.564 --> 02:07:35.529
SAM: Yeah, you're not allowed to move then hold an
action, are you? I don't know how this works.

02:07:35.529 --> 02:07:36.542
LAURA: I don't know.

02:07:36.542 --> 02:07:37.446
LIAM: It's whatever I say it is.

02:07:37.446 --> 02:07:38.756
LAURA: How come we don't know anything?

02:07:38.756 --> 02:07:40.645
LIAM: I'll let you stand at the ready.

02:07:40.645 --> 02:07:41.951
SAM: I will stand at the ready.

02:07:41.951 --> 02:07:43.368
ERICA: It's me, not you.

02:07:43.368 --> 02:07:46.618
LIAM: Don't @ me, bro. Okay, good. Now it is
Lawrence's turn.

02:07:46.618 --> 02:07:51.801
SAM: You know what? To make it easier on you, I'm
going to use my action to, what is it, I can't do

02:07:51.801 --> 02:07:54.456
patient defense, right? I'm not a monk. Dodge, I'm
doing a dodge.

02:07:54.456 --> 02:07:56.638
LIAM: Right, okay, Lawrence.

02:07:56.638 --> 02:08:02.791
TRAVIS: Fuck that noise. I'm going in the gate and
up to the crypt door that is open and I can see

02:08:02.791 --> 02:08:03.944
down, right?

02:08:03.944 --> 02:08:04.777
LIAM: Yeah.

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:06.166
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going down that shit.

02:08:06.166 --> 02:08:08.017
LAURA: (gasp) You're walking into the crypt.
Alone.

02:08:08.017 --> 02:08:09.159
TRAVIS: Yes, I am.

02:08:09.159 --> 02:08:18.724
LIAM: Just to remind you what you know. This is
your entire family line down here. The torchlight

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:23.655
only goes in another 30 or 40 feet before it
disappears into darkness but you know that this

02:08:23.655 --> 02:08:30.955
passage goes a good 100, 150 feet straight and
then it takes a right. It's basically a giant L

02:08:30.955 --> 02:08:38.797
down here and it goes another equal distance to
the end and there are figures of your ancestors

02:08:38.797 --> 02:08:48.965
evenly spaced down the entire hallway. At the
very, very end is the monument to Alfarr, and the

02:08:48.965 --> 02:08:57.605
monument to his daughter, Grenya, as well as the
small monument that Katerine and your father built

02:08:57.605 --> 02:09:01.150
of their own choice for Genevieve.

02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:05.348
TRAVIS: If I get to the bottom of the stairs
before it turns right--

02:09:05.348 --> 02:09:11.587
LIAM: Bottom of the stairs, 150 feet, right. It's
shrouded in darkness.

02:09:11.587 --> 02:09:12.706
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

02:09:12.706 --> 02:09:13.967
LIAM: You can't even see the L-corner.

02:09:13.967 --> 02:09:14.734
SAM: Wait, you're in?

02:09:14.734 --> 02:09:15.604
LAURA: He. Went.

02:09:15.604 --> 02:09:16.668
LIAM: He's just crept in behind Laura.

02:09:16.668 --> 02:09:18.010
SAM: Why didn't you go in?

02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:19.324
LAURA: I was waiting for everyone.

02:09:19.324 --> 02:09:20.516
LIAM: (cooing noise)

02:09:20.516 --> 02:09:22.364
TRAVIS: I don't know, she went to go do--

02:09:22.364 --> 02:09:23.742
LIAM: What would you like to do down there?

02:09:23.742 --> 02:09:25.884
ERICA: Does what she's doing, doesn't she?

02:09:25.884 --> 02:09:33.138
TRAVIS: Can I see if I see anyone, smell anyone,
hear anyone?

02:09:33.138 --> 02:09:38.774
LIAM: Sure, make a perception check. Just a
straight roll.

02:09:38.774 --> 02:09:43.834
TRAVIS: 19, 17 plus two.

02:09:43.834 --> 02:09:47.886
LIAM: You stand-- You can hear the clatter of
blades above, and you hear (goofy voice) "Whoa,

02:09:47.886 --> 02:09:50.970
"what, where are we going?" from up behind you.

02:09:50.970 --> 02:09:53.530
TRAVIS: I don't get it.

02:09:53.530 --> 02:10:02.390
LIAM: There's a lull, and you listen very
carefully. No, nothing. Nothing that you can tell and--

02:10:02.444 --> 02:10:05.303
TRAVIS: I turn my head, I'm sorry, go ahead.

02:10:05.303 --> 02:10:06.525
LIAM: No, you finish.

02:10:06.525 --> 02:10:08.266
TRAVIS: I turn my head and I'll be like (shouting)
Kill the woman to find out what she knows and

02:10:08.341 --> 02:10:09.765
<i>get down here!</i>

02:10:09.765 --> 02:10:21.277
LIAM: Okay. She's in a fucked-up position. She's
going to attempt to break out of the Grasping

02:10:21.277 --> 02:10:23.979
Vine. And she does.

02:10:23.979 --> 02:10:26.693
TJ: Half-strength?

02:10:26.693 --> 02:10:31.227
LIAM: She has half-strength, so it's at
disadvantage, thank you. No, she does not. She

02:10:31.227 --> 02:10:36.589
yanks against it (pants) and she's starting to
hyperventilate, looking at the big beast of a

02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:42.248
woman in front of her. She's going to attempt to
fire her cro-- no, she's not, she can't! Her

02:10:42.248 --> 02:10:50.262
action was trying to get out of the vines. She is
beginning to urinate and staring at a large--

02:10:50.262 --> 02:10:51.308
LAURA: That's her bonus action?

02:10:51.308 --> 02:10:54.037
LIAM: That's her bonus action. Now.

02:10:54.037 --> 02:10:56.034
TRAVIS: Almost undetectable in the mist.

02:10:56.034 --> 02:10:58.745
SAM: Oh no, these guys are attacking?

02:10:58.745 --> 02:11:01.082
TRAVIS: You fucking morons.

02:11:01.082 --> 02:11:02.466
(laughter)

02:11:02.466 --> 02:11:03.744
ERIKA: Your own sister, what are you going to
do?

02:11:03.744 --> 02:11:07.858
TRAVIS: Hey look, all the enemies left the
entrance where we clearly have to go next. Let's

02:11:07.858 --> 02:11:09.374
go follow them!

02:11:09.374 --> 02:11:16.195
LIAM: 20, 25. It's hard getting over that little
wall for them but they can do it.

02:11:16.195 --> 02:11:20.342
LAURA: Oh wait, that's the dude you killed!

02:11:20.342 --> 02:11:25.267
(laughter)

02:11:25.267 --> 02:11:30.291
LIAM: 25, 30 and he can't get around. Over here,
we're going to...

02:11:30.291 --> 02:11:38.009
TRAVIS: Aurra, Lucius, listen to me. Think of it.
Only three shares for the fortune. Let's leave them.

02:11:38.009 --> 02:11:42.344
LAURA: (shouting) Oh my god!

02:11:42.344 --> 02:11:44.404
SAM: What did you do, Portia!

02:11:44.404 --> 02:11:50.770
TRAVIS: Fucking ridiculous! I can't believe it.
You've been playing this for fucking <i>years!</i>

02:11:50.770 --> 02:11:52.744
LIAM: 20, 25, 30...

02:11:52.744 --> 02:11:55.441
SAM: Why would you do this?

02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:56.765
TRAVIS: You went after her!

02:11:56.765 --> 02:11:57.829
SAM: I can't leave her there alone!

02:11:57.829 --> 02:11:58.917
TRAVIS: (shouting) Sure you can!

02:11:58.917 --> 02:12:00.326
SAM: I love my family.

02:12:00.326 --> 02:12:01.858
TRAVIS: No you don't, you don't even like her.

02:12:01.858 --> 02:12:05.737
SAM: I like her better than you, you big dweeb.

02:12:05.737 --> 02:12:09.273
LIAM: They start 28 Days-ing it Later like (zombie
moans).

02:12:09.273 --> 02:12:13.040
SAM: One of them who comes into my range.

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:15.105
LIAM: Yes, you can strike, so go for it.

02:12:15.105 --> 02:12:19.685
SAM: I will attack, because I'm a polearm master,
but I only rolled a ten.

02:12:19.685 --> 02:12:24.123
LIAM: Does not do it.

02:12:24.123 --> 02:12:25.520
SAM: (grunts)

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:30.989
LIAM: Exactly, you're a little bit overwhelmed by
the clattering of a small horde coming at you and

02:12:30.989 --> 02:12:38.818
it actually has a shield so it (scrape-clunk) to
the side. The one that you just hit swings back at

02:12:38.871 --> 02:12:40.222
you, definitely hits.

02:12:40.222 --> 02:12:41.978
SAM: Even though I'm dodging?

02:12:41.978 --> 02:12:45.464
LIAM: Yeah, oh. You chose to dodge, so you can't
attack.

02:12:45.464 --> 02:12:48.763
SAM: I don't know, that's a reaction. I don't know
how this works.

02:12:48.763 --> 02:12:51.587
LIAM: Well, doesn't matter.

02:12:51.587 --> 02:12:53.646
SAM: My action was to dodge.

02:12:53.646 --> 02:12:55.238
LIAM: When it hits.

02:12:55.238 --> 02:12:57.517
SAM: My <i>re</i>action was to polearm strike.

02:12:57.517 --> 02:12:58.574
LAURA: Oh, right.

02:12:58.574 --> 02:12:59.595
LIAM: How do you--

02:12:59.595 --> 02:13:01.262
LAURA: He still gets a reaction.

02:13:01.262 --> 02:13:03.511
LIAM: But that's when something walks away from
him, no?

02:13:03.511 --> 02:13:04.881
SAM: No, I have polearm master.

02:13:04.881 --> 02:13:06.178
LIAM: I've never heard of that.

02:13:06.178 --> 02:13:08.581
SAM: I get to attack when they enter my range.

02:13:08.581 --> 02:13:15.707
LIAM: I believe you, because I've known you a long
time and it does-- you took the dodge action, so

02:13:15.707 --> 02:13:25.903
it misses. That was a clatter of wills between
shield skelly and you. The one next to him got a

02:13:25.903 --> 02:13:27.118
natural 20.

02:13:27.118 --> 02:13:28.211
SAM: Great.

02:13:28.211 --> 02:13:31.266
LIAM: That is a ten.

02:13:31.266 --> 02:13:32.370
SAM: Points?

02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:33.640
LIAM: Points of slashing damage, yep.

02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:34.879
SAM: Oof, rough.

02:13:34.879 --> 02:13:41.813
LIAM: Okay, Portia, let's see. Three of these
things are in range, miss, miss.

02:13:41.813 --> 02:13:45.445
LAURA: 16.

02:13:45.445 --> 02:13:47.285
LIAM: That hits, the last one hits.

02:13:47.285 --> 02:13:48.177
TRAVIS: Portia.

02:13:48.177 --> 02:13:57.732
LIAM: You take three points of slashing damage.
You feel your coat tear and just the tip of a

02:13:57.732 --> 02:14:03.215
blade poke through your scale armor. You feel a
little cut on the small of your back.

02:14:03.215 --> 02:14:04.442
LAURA: (grunt)

02:14:04.442 --> 02:14:06.686
LIAM: Now we are on to Aurra.

02:14:06.686 --> 02:14:19.436
ERICA: I cast-- no.

02:14:19.436 --> 02:14:21.774
TRAVIS: Disembowel.

02:14:21.774 --> 02:14:23.120
ERICA: She's out of the vines.

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:24.682
LIAM: She's in the vines.

02:14:24.682 --> 02:14:28.175
ERICA: She's in the vines. Right, because she's
still weakened, okay.

02:14:28.175 --> 02:14:31.477
SAM: Fuck her up, fuck her up.

02:14:31.477 --> 02:14:35.155
ERICA: I leap on her and I pin her.

02:14:35.155 --> 02:14:36.823
LIAM: You want to hold her down?

02:14:36.823 --> 02:14:38.107
ERICA: Can I hold her down?

02:14:38.107 --> 02:14:45.429
LIAM: Okay, yeah, make a strength check at
advantage.

02:14:45.447 --> 02:14:47.620
At advantage, so roll twice.

02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:50.211
ERICA: Okay, 16.

02:14:50.211 --> 02:14:57.453
LIAM: Yeah, that does it. She is pressed down and
your claw is holding her shoulder into the vines

02:14:57.453 --> 02:15:03.654
on top of here and she's (panting) unable to talk.
Just frozen like a deer.

02:15:03.654 --> 02:15:08.167
ERICA: Can speaking be--

02:15:08.167 --> 02:15:09.499
SAM: Sure.

02:15:09.499 --> 02:15:10.750
ERICA: Who are you?

02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:11.973
SAM: Oh!

02:15:11.973 --> 02:15:13.987
LIAM: We'll get to that. Lucius.

02:15:13.987 --> 02:15:19.352
TJ: I'm going to move-- May I move?

02:15:19.352 --> 02:15:20.656
LIAM: Yeah, absolutely.

02:15:20.656 --> 02:15:28.656
SAM: Yeah, he knows where the better siblings
are.

02:15:28.656 --> 02:15:34.886
LAURA: Do it. Do it!

02:15:34.886 --> 02:15:43.270
SAM: Come on, pray or something, man. We're dying
out here, bro.

02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:50.779
TJ: I will start to pray.

02:15:50.779 --> 02:15:54.046
SAM: Yeah, you got to pray.

02:15:54.046 --> 02:15:56.378
TJ: My first prayer will be--

02:15:56.378 --> 02:15:58.528
SAM: (singing) Pray!

02:15:58.528 --> 02:16:07.687
TJ: --to Channel Divinity. You lost your right to
this land when you died. You are no longer

02:16:07.687 --> 02:16:11.739
Loreleis. Leave this place. I Turn Undead.

02:16:11.739 --> 02:16:14.876
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah, baby!

02:16:14.876 --> 02:16:20.047
LIAM: (counting) 30. I'm going to say that they're
all in range. We got (counting) nine.

02:16:20.047 --> 02:16:21.745
LAURA: Somebody has faith in their siblings.

02:16:21.745 --> 02:16:22.960
LIAM: What's the DC?

02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:23.917
TJ: 15.

02:16:23.917 --> 02:16:28.050
LIAM: 15. Ah, fail. Fail.

02:16:28.050 --> 02:16:34.485
SAM: It was my plan to get them all to clump up
together, so you could do this, right?

02:16:34.485 --> 02:16:45.874
LIAM: Fail, fail, fail, fail. Success, success.

02:16:45.874 --> 02:16:56.327
These skeletons glow with a pale, whitish light.
They raise their arms to the sky, reaching towards

02:16:56.327 --> 02:17:00.475
the moon, which is now clear, and then fall.

02:17:00.475 --> 02:17:08.577
LAURA: Yes! (singing) Our brother is awesome!

02:17:08.577 --> 02:17:16.144
LIAM: Into a clutter of death around you. Well
played. Now we're on Portia.

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:21.319
LAURA: Ha! I'm going to attack the guy that's in
front of me.

02:17:21.319 --> 02:17:23.089
LIAM: Go for it.

02:17:23.089 --> 02:17:28.190
LAURA: (babbling) 18.

02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:29.429
LIAM: Yeah, hits.

02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:35.828
LAURA: Ooh! Eight, sixteen, plus five, is 21
points of damage to the guy.

02:17:35.828 --> 02:17:40.521
LIAM: Okay, you are charging on adrenaline and
you take that sword that belonged to your father

02:17:40.521 --> 02:17:45.960
and ram it straight though the skull. It goes
through the eye socket, out the back and you have

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:46.981
to shake it hard.

02:17:46.981 --> 02:17:50.868
LAURA: While I shake it hard, I swing at the next
guy standing next to me.

02:17:50.868 --> 02:17:53.604
LIAM: Excellent. With the skull still on the
blade-- Go for it.

02:17:53.604 --> 02:17:56.529
LAURA: Yeah! 16.

02:17:56.529 --> 02:17:57.537
LIAM: Hits.

02:17:57.537 --> 02:18:04.104
LAURA: Ooh, yeah that's good. Eight plus eight is
16, plus six is 22.

02:18:04.104 --> 02:18:08.165
LIAM: Okay. The skull crashes down on the skull
and it does not get obliterated by slashing

02:18:08.165 --> 02:18:15.376
damage, it's bludgeoning damage as skull hits
skull, and it crunches it down into the top of the

02:18:15.376 --> 02:18:20.242
ribcage. It becomes condensed so the head is down
here now, and the two-- the one falls to the

02:18:20.242 --> 02:18:24.901
ground and you tilt your blade and it goes
(scratching) (thud) off the end.

02:18:24.901 --> 02:18:34.201
LAURA: Then I step back next to Benicio and I say,
It's your turn, Benny.

02:18:34.201 --> 02:18:37.903
LIAM: (singing) Benny! Benny!

02:18:37.903 --> 02:18:41.935
SAM: I will charge and attack and roll a 13!

02:18:41.935 --> 02:18:43.705
LIAM: Hits, just.

02:18:43.705 --> 02:18:49.000
SAM: Oh yeah. 13 points of damage.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:55.211
LIAM: Okay. You send it right into the thing's--
because you're a cruel motherfucker-- right

02:18:55.211 --> 02:19:00.564
through the nonexistent groin of this thing and
then give it a circle around and the centrifugal

02:19:00.564 --> 02:19:06.307
force shakes the poor bastard apart, and the
ribcage falls to one side and the legs clatter to

02:19:06.307 --> 02:19:11.047
the ground, fall down into the hole that the thing
climbed out of earlier--

02:19:11.047 --> 02:19:13.628
SAM: I grab an arm and be like, Why're you hitting
yourself?

02:19:13.628 --> 02:19:17.180
(laughter)

02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:18.697
LIAM: Love it.

02:19:18.697 --> 02:19:21.208
SAM: All right. Oh no, where's Larry?

02:19:21.208 --> 02:19:27.855
TRAVIS: I'm down here! It's very dark!

02:19:27.855 --> 02:19:32.393
LIAM: You know, we have a terrified redhead pinned
under a werewolf on the roof of the mausoleum and

02:19:32.393 --> 02:19:38.908
Larry is down in the dark. I think this is a good
time to take our break. Before we do, it's time

02:19:38.908 --> 02:19:44.881
for our giveaway break! Important to know that
we've made some changes moving forward, you'll

02:19:44.881 --> 02:19:50.476
need to enter the weekly keyword into the Critical
Role Twitch chat. If you are watching on the Geek

02:19:50.476 --> 02:19:56.603
& Sundry Twitch channel or on Alpha, you'll need
to hop over to twitch.tv/criticalrole and enter

02:19:56.603 --> 02:20:00.814
the keyword. Right now the offer is only good for
residents of the United States and Canada

02:20:00.814 --> 02:20:06.928
excluding Quebec, for the official rules, sorry
Quebec. Follow the link to the chat, tonight's

02:20:06.928 --> 02:20:17.892
prize is this myrtlewood dice tower system
featuring Kor'Treum cartography by Deven Rue.

02:20:17.892 --> 02:20:18.919
LAURA: Whoa!

02:20:18.919 --> 02:20:22.854
LIAM: It's got that pretty leather strap, look at
that gorgeousness!

02:20:22.854 --> 02:20:23.939
ERICA: That's gorgeous.

02:20:23.939 --> 02:20:26.510
TJ: Can you say that site again?

02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:28.251
(laughter)

02:20:28.251 --> 02:20:30.325
LIAM: Wyrmwood! Myrtlewood dice tower system.

02:20:30.325 --> 02:20:36.874
I'm about to give you the keyword but
remember only enter it once in chat. Entering it

02:20:36.874 --> 02:20:42.274
more than once will disqualify you. After I say
the keyword the contest is officially started. The

02:20:42.274 --> 02:20:44.407
keyword for tonight is "howl."

02:20:44.407 --> 02:20:46.027
LAURA: Yeah, that's a good one.

02:20:46.027 --> 02:20:51.008
TRAVIS: H-O-U-L. Howl. H-O-W-L.

02:20:51.008 --> 02:20:57.447
LIAM: Good luck y'all. Please keep an eye on your
whispers as we will be reaching out to the winner

02:20:57.447 --> 02:21:01.689
for eligibility during the break. We'll see you
soon.

02:21:01.689 --> 02:21:04.721
(howling)

02:21:04.721 --> 02:35:37.603
[break]

02:35:37.603 --> 02:35:40.008
LIAM: Welcome back! Welcome to Werewolfville!

02:35:40.008 --> 02:35:41.379
SAM: We didn't say anything.

02:35:41.379 --> 02:35:44.026
LIAM: Here we are. Titty sprinkles, how about
that?

02:35:44.026 --> 02:35:44.957
SAM: That's great.

02:35:44.957 --> 02:35:46.073
ERICA: That's a good one.

02:35:46.073 --> 02:35:47.775
LIAM: So we have a winner for our contest!

02:35:47.775 --> 02:35:48.603
TRAVIS: Horse nipples.

02:35:48.603 --> 02:35:56.163
LIAM: It is horse nipples! No, it's Oldar_! That
is an underscore, not the word "underscore."

02:35:56.163 --> 02:35:57.783
Congratulations on your wood!

02:35:57.783 --> 02:36:00.429
SAM: You've won an amazing piece of... stuff.

02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:08.793
LIAM: It's freaking gorgeous. There it is one more
time, and it's Wyrmwood. You know what? I really

02:36:08.998 --> 02:36:11.317
just want to dive back in, because there's so much
to do.

02:36:11.317 --> 02:36:13.288
SAM: Where'd the map go? We're done with that?

02:36:13.288 --> 02:36:14.778
LIAM: It's gone. I don't know.

02:36:14.778 --> 02:36:16.404
TRAVIS: We know where everything was.

02:36:16.404 --> 02:36:18.617
SAM: Okay. We can start exploring without Laura.

02:36:18.617 --> 02:36:24.037
LIAM: Lawrence-- She'll come out when she's ready.
Lawrence is down below, Portia is counting her

02:36:24.037 --> 02:36:34.381
lucky stars. I'll say, Aurra, you currently are a
big, black-and-gray furred beast leaning down on

02:36:34.381 --> 02:36:41.778
top of this bedraggled ginger thug on top of the
mausoleum. She's petrified, and there's just a

02:36:41.778 --> 02:36:47.723
moment of silence between the two of you as you
huff in her face, and you can hear the wind now,

02:36:47.723 --> 02:36:52.540
moaning low against the walls of the castle in the
distance, and through the trees behind you.

02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:57.416
ERICA: I said, Who are you?

02:36:57.416 --> 02:37:00.590
LIAM: Which comes out in a deep, bassy rumble.
Make an intimidation roll.

02:37:06.010 --> 02:37:07.931
SAM: Nice!

02:37:10.211 --> 02:37:11.086
ERICA: 17.

02:37:11.086 --> 02:37:12.205
SAM: Yeah!

02:37:12.205 --> 02:37:27.300
LIAM: "(stammering) I'm from Deastok. We were
hired-- We've been living here for weeks. Working

02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:34.834
"for the elf. Listen, we just do what he tells us!"

02:37:34.834 --> 02:37:39.484
ERICA: Where is this elf?

02:37:39.484 --> 02:37:47.577
LIAM: "He's waiting for you. He told us to soften
you up."

02:37:47.577 --> 02:37:55.467
ERICA: To soften us up? For what, exactly?

02:37:55.467 --> 02:38:01.881
LIAM: "I don't know. We don't know!"

02:38:01.881 --> 02:38:04.196
ERICA: (yelling) Tell us where to go!

02:38:04.196 --> 02:38:06.259
TRAVIS: Ooh, shit!

02:38:06.259 --> 02:38:17.652
LIAM: You feel a little bit of warm liquid run
against your knee, your furred knee, in the vines

02:38:17.652 --> 02:38:28.091
on top of the building. "Down! Down. (crying)
That's all I know, I swear to all the gods, I

02:38:28.091 --> 02:38:29.483
don't know anything!"

02:38:29.483 --> 02:38:35.366
TJ: Does she know where our father is? If he's
alive?

02:38:35.366 --> 02:38:38.020
ERICA: Do you know of a man named Haldur?

02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:48.908
LIAM: "Yeah, we watched as he hacked his arm off.
He's got him down below."

02:38:48.908 --> 02:38:52.398
TRAVIS: (quietly) He's alive.

02:38:52.398 --> 02:38:54.860
ERICA: He's got him down below.

02:38:54.860 --> 02:39:10.044
LIAM: "Please. I'll go right now, I'll run into the
woods."

02:39:12.294 --> 02:39:13.681
ERICA: I throw her off the roof.

02:39:13.681 --> 02:39:14.813
SAM: Oh!

02:39:22.407 --> 02:39:33.176
LIAM: She arcs over your head, Lucius, and you
watch her strike the wrought iron fence behind

02:39:33.176 --> 02:39:42.603
you. She lands with a sickening splut as two of
the metal poles go through her gut. She is now

02:39:42.629 --> 02:39:50.533
hanging backwards on the fence, but she's not
dead. She's now just gasping.

02:39:50.533 --> 02:39:54.554
TJ: I will say a prayer for you.

02:39:55.085 --> 02:39:57.254
LIAM: She's holding the iron coming out of her
belly.

02:39:57.254 --> 02:39:58.818
SAM: That sounds like a threat.

02:39:58.818 --> 02:40:02.477
TJ: This prayer is called "Toll the Dead."

02:40:02.477 --> 02:40:09.641
TRAVIS: Oh shit! No mercy.

02:40:09.641 --> 02:40:11.882
TJ: May I do it?

02:40:11.882 --> 02:40:19.235
LIAM: Absolutely. May you please do. Wisdom save
or take damage. Your DC is 15, right?

02:40:19.235 --> 02:40:20.128
TJ: Yes.

02:40:20.128 --> 02:40:24.622
LIAM: She just makes it, so it's 1d8.

02:40:24.622 --> 02:40:28.229
TJ: She's damaged. It's d12, yes?

02:40:28.229 --> 02:40:39.506
LIAM: If it's missing any hit points, the damage
is 1d12. She wasn't, otherwise it's 1d8. The

02:40:39.506 --> 02:40:44.256
damage increases by one die when you reach 5th, so
that is 2d8.

02:40:44.256 --> 02:40:47.074
TJ: Wait, she's not damaged by the spikes?

02:40:47.074 --> 02:40:53.201
LIAM: Oh, of course she is. You're right, thank
you, it's 2d12, because of his level.

02:40:53.201 --> 02:40:56.763
TJ: 13 points of damage.

02:40:56.763 --> 02:41:07.597
LIAM: (laughs) She starts gibbering, going
(groaning) and you watch as blood starts pouring

02:41:07.898 --> 02:41:16.105
out of her nose and her ears and she's like a
goldfish gasping for breath, going (gasping).

02:41:16.105 --> 02:41:19.026
TJ: This too shall pass. I turn around and I walk.

02:41:19.026 --> 02:41:28.532
LIAM: It's not passing yet, though. She is there
going (gurgling and gasping).

02:41:28.532 --> 02:41:29.361
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

02:41:29.361 --> 02:41:33.417
SAM: What religion is this, dude? That's crazy!

02:41:33.417 --> 02:41:37.200
TJ: She chopped our father's hand off.

02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:42.236
SAM: Yeah, but wow, that was ice cold.

02:41:42.236 --> 02:41:47.948
LIAM: "Please!" (gurgling)

02:41:47.948 --> 02:42:05.011
SAM: All right, I guess I'll go jab her with the
glaive. Twist a little. One more twist. Okay.

02:42:05.011 --> 02:42:07.428
LIAM: She's still.

02:42:07.428 --> 02:42:08.858
SAM: She's alive?!

02:42:08.858 --> 02:42:10.425
LIAM: She is <i>still</i>.

02:42:10.425 --> 02:42:11.162
SAM: Oh.

02:42:11.162 --> 02:42:15.836
(laughter)

02:42:15.836 --> 02:42:19.183
TRAVIS: "Do you need a pro to--?" "She's
<i>still</i>."

02:42:19.183 --> 02:42:28.758
LIAM: Now you all stand around the absolute wreck
of this woman, listening to the wind moan on the

02:42:28.758 --> 02:42:34.813
hill of Castle Lorelei, flame flickering in the
censer inside the mausoleum.

02:42:34.813 --> 02:42:36.524
SAM: Let's go get Dad.

02:42:36.524 --> 02:42:38.698
TJ: What did you learn?

02:42:38.698 --> 02:42:40.237
ERICA: What was that, brother?

02:42:40.237 --> 02:42:41.744
TJ: What did you learn?

02:42:41.744 --> 02:42:43.952
ERICA: She said he was down below.

02:42:43.952 --> 02:42:46.335
LAURA: Did she say who took him?

02:42:46.335 --> 02:42:49.154
SAM: The elf.

02:42:49.154 --> 02:42:52.190
LAURA: It was an elf! Told you, fucking pointy
ears, man.

02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:53.758
ERICA: I didn't see any pointy ears.

02:42:53.758 --> 02:42:56.670
TRAVIS: Are you all done?

02:42:56.670 --> 02:42:58.930
SAM: Oh, are you still down there?

02:42:58.930 --> 02:43:02.107
TRAVIS: It's very cold and dark!

02:43:02.107 --> 02:43:04.776
ERICA: Do you see anything, brother?

02:43:04.776 --> 02:43:08.771
TRAVIS: No! I am hesitant to proceed without you!

02:43:08.771 --> 02:43:11.537
ERICA: We are coming.

02:43:11.537 --> 02:43:17.479
SAM: All right, let's go. Do we need to do
anything first? Anyone need to heal?

02:43:18.237 --> 02:43:19.431
ERICA: Or transform.

02:43:19.431 --> 02:43:22.146
SAM: Oh yeah, yours must be wearing off soon.
How's that work?

02:43:22.146 --> 02:43:23.186
TRAVIS: Ten minutes?

02:43:23.186 --> 02:43:24.355
ERICA: Three hours.

02:43:24.355 --> 02:43:31.450
LIAM: It doesn't work the same for all of you,
because Aurra has spent so much time free of the

02:43:31.450 --> 02:43:38.810
shackles of polite society. She has lived in her
second skin for long periods of time.

02:43:38.810 --> 02:43:42.060
ERICA: Okay, you two.

02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:50.144
LIAM: You could do a short rest here, if you want
to, or rush to your father's aid, if you wanted to.

02:43:51.172 --> 02:43:54.328
SAM: We've got to rush to our father's aid, right?
Are you okay?

02:43:54.328 --> 02:43:57.769
LAURA: I mean, I'm at halfsies.

02:43:57.769 --> 02:44:03.405
TJ: Rest. You should rest, and I will pray.

02:44:03.405 --> 02:44:06.840
LAURA: Dad might be bleeding out right now.

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:10.029
SAM: Yeah, he's got no hand. Free rest is a half
hour.

02:44:10.029 --> 02:44:15.574
TJ: The dead that we have already seen has been
days in the making. I do not think that anything

02:44:15.574 --> 02:44:18.423
new is transpiring if he wants us there.

02:44:18.423 --> 02:44:27.104
LIAM: Just as a reminder, I think I said this,
when you were looking at things in the study-- or

02:44:27.104 --> 02:44:28.447
did you look?

02:44:28.447 --> 02:44:29.593
TRAVIS: I did.

02:44:29.593 --> 02:44:32.381
LIAM: Who saw that blood on the floor? You did? It
wasn't fresh.

02:44:32.381 --> 02:44:36.994
LAURA: Yeah, we should take a short rest.

02:44:42.006 --> 02:44:47.749
TRAVIS: In the time while they're resting,
underneath the crypts.

02:44:47.749 --> 02:44:49.697
LIAM: Yes, Lawrence.

02:44:49.697 --> 02:44:56.231
TRAVIS: I slowly back out. I walk up the stairs.
What the fuck are you doing?!

02:44:56.231 --> 02:44:58.750
SAM: Oh, we decided to take like a break.

02:44:58.750 --> 02:45:01.286
TRAVIS: You couldn't let me know?

02:45:01.286 --> 02:45:11.129
SAM: We didn't want to alert the bad guys of our
plans. How were you down there? Was it scary?

02:45:11.129 --> 02:45:13.994
TRAVIS: It was fine. No, I saw nothing. I'm not
even sure we're in the right place.

02:45:13.994 --> 02:45:20.845
LAURA: I can't believe you guys didn't bury
grandmother down here. Great aunt. Whatever. Katerine.

02:45:22.694 --> 02:45:25.963
ERICA: I thought she was deserving of a proper,
natural burial.

02:45:25.963 --> 02:45:28.743
LAURA: Our entire family is down here.

02:45:28.743 --> 02:45:30.546
TJ: Not anymore.

02:45:30.546 --> 02:45:32.525
ERICA: Does that make it right?

02:45:32.525 --> 02:45:39.656
SAM: When I die, I want to be buried down here
with the others. Not in the freaking woods,

02:45:39.656 --> 02:45:48.384
haphazardly, on a rainy night. I want there to be
a big funeral where everyone comes and says

02:45:48.384 --> 02:45:49.379
things, and--

02:45:49.379 --> 02:45:52.729
TJ: Half of our family is now running through
those woods. Dead.

02:45:52.729 --> 02:45:53.892
SAM: Oh yeah.

02:45:53.892 --> 02:45:57.915
LIAM: I can see this conversation. You guys are
all sitting against the walls inside the

02:45:57.915 --> 02:46:03.115
mausoleum, with the light of the single censer
flickering in the dark, the wind blowing, and you

02:46:03.115 --> 02:46:04.693
guys gently bickering like old times.

02:46:04.693 --> 02:46:13.157
TJ: Those censers, they need to be dealt with. I
bury them in the mud so they don't do whatever it

02:46:13.157 --> 02:46:14.246
is they do.

02:46:14.246 --> 02:46:22.141
LIAM: Sure. You can easily grab one of your
great-great-great-great-aunt's shield and scoop

02:46:22.141 --> 02:46:26.997
mud over them. They're dark, too. They're done
releasing whatever they were releasing.

02:46:26.997 --> 02:46:39.436
SAM: While we have this moment, Luci. It's been
nagging me. You know, being a holy man, are you

02:46:39.436 --> 02:46:46.260
allowed to, like-- you know. You know.

02:46:46.260 --> 02:46:47.652
TJ: What?

02:46:47.652 --> 02:46:56.265
SAM: Come on, you allowed to be with a lady or
anything? Or do you have to be all chaste?

02:46:56.265 --> 02:47:06.171
TJ: Do you not remember the stories our aunt told
us? The Moonweaver is the goddess of secret trysts

02:47:06.171 --> 02:47:07.680
in dark places.

02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:10.087
LAURA: He gets a <i>lot</i> of action.

02:47:10.087 --> 02:47:11.632
TJ: A <i>lot</i>.

02:47:11.632 --> 02:47:13.210
SAM: Wait.

02:47:13.210 --> 02:47:19.786
(laughter)

02:47:19.786 --> 02:47:20.711
SAM: Really?

02:47:20.711 --> 02:47:22.697
LIAM: Yes, that happened!

02:47:22.697 --> 02:47:26.593
SAM: What? Oh man, I should have paid more
attention!

02:47:26.593 --> 02:47:28.502
LIAM: No take-backs, TJ!

02:47:28.502 --> 02:47:36.109
SAM: Most of those times that she was giving us
those talks, I painted on an eye and I napped out,

02:47:36.109 --> 02:47:43.480
but whoa! I should have paid more attention. Wow.

02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:52.078
TJ: I continue to talk about that for a moment,
and then I go back into the other things that Aunt

02:47:52.078 --> 02:47:59.674
Katerine told us as well as our father. I take
this opportunity to remind them what it is that

02:47:59.674 --> 02:48:08.622
we're doing here and why we're here. I use
Inspiring Leader. I choose my allies, all of them,

02:48:08.622 --> 02:48:12.542
and they get ten temporary hit points on top of
their total.

02:48:12.542 --> 02:48:20.811
SAM: We're taking a short rest. I'm going to use
my hit die to restore to my total.

02:48:20.811 --> 02:48:22.220
LIAM: Aurra, you weren't damaged. You're fine.

02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:25.251
TJ: You have plus ten now.

02:48:25.251 --> 02:48:26.932
TRAVIS: That is great.

02:48:26.932 --> 02:48:34.170
LIAM: Are you back to full? Just checking.

02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:40.413
SAM: I'm back to full. Wait, now we have extra hit
points?

02:48:40.413 --> 02:48:41.693
TJ: Plus ten.

02:48:41.693 --> 02:48:49.600
SAM: Wow, crazy. That will come in handy.

02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:55.058
ERICA: Am I to write an extra ten? I was lost on
that. Is that a thing? Oh, I do get an extra ten.

02:48:55.058 --> 02:49:02.754
LIAM: The clouds have completely blown over, and
it is a clear night. It is not a full moon, but it

02:49:02.754 --> 02:49:06.604
is just shy of one, and you feel it.

02:49:06.604 --> 02:49:13.649
TRAVIS: Perhaps it's time for us to continue
below. Yes?

02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:26.838
TJ: Say a short prayer to the Moonweaver, and I'll
pray for her and give her Guidance.

02:49:26.838 --> 02:49:27.609
LAURA: For what?

02:49:27.609 --> 02:49:34.089
TJ: I don't know. You'll have it for about a
minute. Once we start moving. For checks.

02:49:34.909 --> 02:49:39.313
ERICA: Can we speak to the goddess of the
wilderness as well? What?

02:49:39.313 --> 02:49:42.475
SAM: What are you going to say? What do you need?

02:49:42.475 --> 02:49:45.062
ERICA: Her aid.

02:49:45.062 --> 02:49:46.652
SAM: Oh, yeah.

02:49:46.652 --> 02:49:49.636
TJ: Couldn't hurt.

02:49:49.636 --> 02:49:56.353
LIAM: Are we progressing?

02:49:56.353 --> 02:49:57.624
LAURA: Let's move forward.

02:49:57.624 --> 02:50:00.235
LIAM: Okay. Who wants to lead the way?

02:50:00.235 --> 02:50:02.609
SAM: I'll lead the way.

02:50:02.609 --> 02:50:06.116
TRAVIS: I'll join my twin.

02:50:06.116 --> 02:50:13.384
SAM: Before we go down there, I'm going to cast
the Rite of the Flame on my glaive, because the

02:50:13.384 --> 02:50:15.628
short rest has lost that.

02:50:15.628 --> 02:50:18.739
LIAM: That's right.
(Professor Frink voice) On my glaive!

02:50:18.739 --> 02:50:23.582
SAM: (Professor Frink voice) To glaive!

02:50:27.642 --> 02:50:33.365
LIAM: Lawrence was the only one who saw this
before. Once you descend these marble stairs down

02:50:33.365 --> 02:50:41.604
to the crypt, it's dark. You're still getting the
light of the fire above you, but that trickles to

02:50:41.969 --> 02:50:44.308
nothing in about 30 or 40 feet.

02:50:44.308 --> 02:50:49.743
TJ: I will pray for Light on anything that you
want, if you have a shield or a weapon that you

02:50:49.743 --> 02:50:51.259
would like.

02:50:51.259 --> 02:50:55.488
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll pull out both shortswords and
say--

02:51:00.198 --> 02:51:07.435
LIAM: It glows in the dark, and the twins lead the
way down this hall. You've been here many times.

02:51:08.110 --> 02:51:15.597
You've seen these likenesses of people long since
past, some in this century, but the deeper you go,

02:51:15.597 --> 02:51:23.906
the longer back it goes. You reach that bend and
turn to the right, and as soon as you turn,

02:51:23.906 --> 02:51:31.688
something is off. Because you have been here at
night, even, sneaking out of the back entrance of

02:51:31.688 --> 02:51:42.005
the keep, stealing your father's key on a lark. It
is always pitch black down here, but right now, at

02:51:42.005 --> 02:51:56.028
the far end, where you know there is a dead end,
is light flickering in where the wall is. It's

02:51:56.028 --> 02:52:00.089
hard to tell. You're a good 150 feet away from it
right now.

02:52:00.089 --> 02:52:04.307
ERICA: Do you see that light?

02:52:04.307 --> 02:52:05.911
SAM: Yeah.

02:52:05.911 --> 02:52:14.397
TRAVIS: If this elf is worth anything, he's laid
some traps before us. I certainly would.

02:52:14.397 --> 02:52:20.316
SAM: You want to go first and check for them? Or
do you want me to do my thing?

02:52:20.316 --> 02:52:22.689
TRAVIS: By all means.

02:52:22.689 --> 02:52:25.142
LAURA: How far away is it?

02:52:25.142 --> 02:52:27.665
TRAVIS: 150 feet.

02:52:27.665 --> 02:52:32.961
ERICA: May I cast Faerie Fire?

02:52:32.961 --> 02:52:35.952
LIAM: Right here, where you are?

02:52:35.952 --> 02:52:38.959
ERICA: Into the darkness.

02:52:38.959 --> 02:52:45.192
LIAM: Into the dark? You can, absolutely, with the
intention to what, light up the hall?

02:52:45.192 --> 02:52:48.175
ERICA: Light up whatever objects are in our path.

02:52:48.175 --> 02:52:56.008
LIAM: Currently, you can see from the light of his
blades that the hall is clear, and light gets

02:52:56.008 --> 02:53:01.507
dimmer and dimmer and dimmer, but you see some
flickering at the wall far in the distance.

02:53:01.507 --> 02:53:02.978
Nothing's blocking your way.

02:53:02.978 --> 02:53:05.746
ERICA: Okay, got it. I'm going to hold that,
then.

02:53:05.746 --> 02:53:16.015
TJ: I will take out a copper piece and pray for
Light on it, and throw it as far as I can comfortably.

02:53:16.655 --> 02:53:23.007
LIAM: Interesting. Okay, you throw it about 40
feet and it strikes the stone and you hear it go

02:53:23.007 --> 02:53:29.873
(tinging). You watch as that little light slides
down the hall. It makes it about halfway there.

02:53:29.873 --> 02:53:41.279
It's strange. You know at the end of this hallway
is where, again, Alfarr, the first of the wolves,

02:53:41.279 --> 02:53:54.278
and his daughter, Grenya, the first to be born a
wolf, that's where their bodies rest in shrines to

02:53:54.278 --> 02:54:06.028
each of them. Monuments, I should say. Your father
and Aunt Kat, before your time, created a small

02:54:06.028 --> 02:54:18.468
altar at the end of this hall for Genevieve. It's
the family-- not secret, but shame. The family was

02:54:18.468 --> 02:54:33.102
ashamed of Genevieve and her leanings and her
choices in life and her ferocity. They worried

02:54:33.102 --> 02:54:46.584
that she would let the secret out. That generation
above Katerine, they were very rigid, and they

02:54:46.584 --> 02:54:53.645
sealed her away. Again, these crypts were built
within an already existing cave system that was

02:54:54.218 --> 02:55:06.175
utilized and built out. Your father told you a
couple of times. It pained both Hal and Kat, but

02:55:06.175 --> 02:55:14.710
Genevieve was laid to rest within a cave and
sealed inside, never to be seen or to be spoken

02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:29.130
of. Where that altar to your grandmother has
always been there is clutter on the ground, and

02:55:29.130 --> 02:55:31.077
there is a hole.

02:55:33.597 --> 02:55:36.198
ERICA: So she was entombed alive?

02:55:36.198 --> 02:55:43.189
LIAM: No, she was killed. Outside of the castle
grounds.

02:55:43.189 --> 02:55:45.034
LAURA: We don't know who did it.

02:55:45.034 --> 02:55:48.148
ERICA: By perhaps her husband, or no?

02:55:48.148 --> 02:55:56.671
LIAM: You've heard a couple of theories. Kat was
always very reluctant to speak of it. It made her

02:55:56.671 --> 02:55:58.298
very sad, the subject.

02:55:58.298 --> 02:56:01.770
SAM: But there's a hole in front of her crypt?
Tomb?

02:56:01.770 --> 02:56:10.535
LIAM: It wasn't even a crypt. It was just a small
statue in her likeness and a small step that Hal

02:56:10.535 --> 02:56:16.025
would leave flowers on. There's rubble there right
now.

02:56:16.025 --> 02:56:17.743
TRAVIS. Enough of this. I walk forward.

02:56:17.743 --> 02:56:19.374
SAM: Lawrence!

02:56:19.374 --> 02:56:22.573
LIAM: You stride down the hallway, your siblings
watching as you go.

02:56:22.573 --> 02:56:23.592
LAURA: I follow.

02:56:23.592 --> 02:56:24.915
SAM: I'm following as fast as I can.

02:56:24.915 --> 02:56:26.110
ERICA: What's your intention?

02:56:26.110 --> 02:56:27.666
LAURA: We're going into the tunnels.

02:56:27.666 --> 02:56:32.574
LIAM: It becomes easier to see, the statue of
Genevieve is in three separate pieces on the

02:56:32.574 --> 02:56:39.010
ground, and as you come up by the light of the
coin behind you and your own sword overtaking it,

02:56:39.010 --> 02:56:46.775
you see two large, black, iron hammers lying on
the ground here. You see what you remember as

02:56:46.775 --> 02:56:55.370
being a very smooth wall of stone ruptured with
rubble lying around, and it's not wide, but a

02:56:55.370 --> 02:57:01.339
crack leading through. This is something you have
never seen before.

02:57:01.339 --> 02:57:03.386
TRAVIS: So a dead end no longer.

02:57:03.386 --> 02:57:04.577
LIAM: Correct.

02:57:04.577 --> 02:57:15.268
TRAVIS: Whoa. I figured as much. Our road does not
end here. Blood on the floor? Any signs of struggle?

02:57:16.412 --> 02:57:18.362
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

02:57:18.362 --> 02:57:22.810
TRAVIS: That's 18.

02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:31.817
LIAM: You take that blade and spend five minutes,
carefully checking that hole as you go, but

02:57:31.817 --> 02:57:41.381
looking along the ground. You don't see any blood.
You don't see signs of anything other than the

02:57:41.381 --> 02:57:48.773
destruction of the stone in front of you, and the
desecration of your family's most hallowed ground.

02:57:48.773 --> 02:57:50.032
LAURA: Aurra?

02:57:50.032 --> 02:57:52.184
ERICA: Yes, sister?

02:57:52.184 --> 02:57:55.662
LAURA: Can you smell him?

02:57:55.662 --> 02:58:00.522
LIAM: Make a perception check with advantage.

02:58:00.522 --> 02:58:04.018
LAURA: Wait, roll again!

02:58:04.018 --> 02:58:06.962
ERICA: Oh, roll it again! At advantage, thank you.

02:58:06.962 --> 02:58:08.412
SAM: That's good!

02:58:08.412 --> 02:58:09.276
ERICA: 16?

02:58:09.276 --> 02:58:11.414
LAURA: But the other one was higher, so it was 12
plus--

02:58:11.414 --> 02:58:16.598
ERICA: Was it 12? Thank you. Plus seven. 19?

02:58:16.598 --> 02:58:29.815
LIAM: You sniff through your canine snout. You
don't smell anything, but your ear, finely tuned,

02:58:29.815 --> 02:58:39.241
listens and listens, and you do hear (shallow
breathing).

02:58:39.241 --> 02:58:40.272
SAM: From where?

02:58:40.272 --> 02:58:41.324
LAURA: Do you smell him?

02:58:41.324 --> 02:58:44.172
ERICA: Breathing. I hear breathing. I do not smell
him!

02:58:44.172 --> 02:58:45.212
LIAM: Deep ahead.

02:58:45.212 --> 02:58:46.968
SAM: That way?

02:58:46.968 --> 02:58:48.098
ERICA: That way.

02:58:48.098 --> 02:58:50.003
SAM: I'm going. (running noises)

02:58:50.003 --> 02:58:51.414
LIAM: Going in?

02:58:51.414 --> 02:58:52.226
SAM: Yeah.

02:58:52.226 --> 02:58:53.007
LIAM: Sneaking in or storming in?

02:58:53.007 --> 02:58:54.153
SAM: No, just storming.

02:58:54.153 --> 02:58:56.563
LAURA: Yeah, going off to find Daddy.

02:58:56.563 --> 02:58:59.506
SAM: I have very tiny feet.

02:58:59.506 --> 02:59:03.731
LIAM: Okay. I think we should decide an order, so
we have--

02:59:03.731 --> 02:59:04.814
SAM: Twins in front.

02:59:04.814 --> 02:59:06.218
LIAM: Twinsies in front.

02:59:06.218 --> 02:59:06.832
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:59:06.832 --> 02:59:08.735
SAM: Yin and yang.

02:59:08.735 --> 02:59:11.509
LIAM: Okay, so the blood hunters leading the way.

02:59:11.509 --> 02:59:13.578
TRAVIS: Brilliant and idiot.

02:59:13.578 --> 02:59:17.491
LIAM: Who's taking the rear?

02:59:17.491 --> 02:59:19.106
ERICA: I'll take the rear.

02:59:19.106 --> 02:59:23.625
LIAM: And are we one wolf and four humans?

02:59:23.625 --> 02:59:25.187
SAM: For now.

02:59:25.187 --> 02:59:26.727
LIAM: For now? Good.

02:59:26.727 --> 02:59:28.843
SAM: Are you going to wolf out?

02:59:28.843 --> 02:59:29.753
TRAVIS: Not yet.

02:59:29.753 --> 02:59:34.905
LAURA: I don't know. Is it close? If we can hear
them breathing, they're close. I just don't want

02:59:34.905 --> 02:59:35.954
to waste it.

02:59:35.954 --> 02:59:38.346
ERICA: You folks have always been afraid of your
darkness.

02:59:38.346 --> 02:59:39.496
LIAM: The way beyond--

02:59:39.496 --> 02:59:41.860
LAURA: I go. I'm going to go wolf.

02:59:41.860 --> 02:59:50.628
LIAM: You're going wolf? Okay, so your arms, your
shoulders, your biceps swell. You start to reach

02:59:50.985 --> 02:59:57.564
the size of the twins and pass it just a little
bit. Why don't you tell us how you look in your

02:59:57.564 --> 02:59:59.072
wolven form?

02:59:59.072 --> 03:00:05.544
LAURA: Okay. I resemble the way my hair is, so I'm
all black fur on top, and my underside is all

03:00:05.544 --> 03:00:10.643
stark white. Kind of like a reverse skunk! Yeah!

03:00:10.643 --> 03:00:18.104
LIAM: Still holding that blade in your hands;
stalking forward.

03:00:18.104 --> 03:00:24.215
LAURA: Yeah. And I'm clutching his ring around my
neck. It has a long chain, so it's not strangling

03:00:24.215 --> 03:00:25.968
me or anything.

03:00:25.968 --> 03:00:29.241
LIAM: Got it, got it. Okay, so two wolves. Three
men.

03:00:29.241 --> 03:00:32.368
TJ: Who has that elven blade?

03:00:32.368 --> 03:00:33.999
TRAVIS: Oh, I do.

03:00:33.999 --> 03:00:35.436
TJ: Is it in your hand?

03:00:35.436 --> 03:00:38.354
TRAVIS: I just have it like, in my belt. Would you
like to see it?

03:00:38.354 --> 03:00:39.405
TJ: Can I see it?

03:00:39.405 --> 03:00:40.820
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:42.704
TJ: I can read Elven; what does this say?

03:00:42.704 --> 03:00:44.056
LIAM: The dagger that was found inside?

03:00:44.056 --> 03:00:47.853
SAM: Message, or something? What was it?

03:00:47.853 --> 03:00:49.144
LIAM: Silent message.

03:00:49.144 --> 03:00:51.763
LAURA: Kind of like a whisper.

03:00:51.763 --> 03:00:53.888
TJ: Is this an elven blade?

03:00:53.888 --> 03:00:59.626
LIAM: Yeah, it's got elven language carved on it--
Well, it has elven language carved on it.

03:00:59.626 --> 03:01:04.103
TJ: Silent message. Does that mean anything to
me?

03:01:04.103 --> 03:01:08.716
LIAM: Make a history check?

03:01:08.716 --> 03:01:11.626
TJ: I pray.

03:01:11.626 --> 03:01:13.758
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:01:13.758 --> 03:01:20.002
SAM: (singing) Pray, pray.

03:01:20.002 --> 03:01:22.491
TJ: 18.

03:01:22.491 --> 03:01:31.013
LIAM: 18? You've heard a fair amount, not as much
as your brother. You've read about--

03:01:31.013 --> 03:01:35.468
TJ: I'll discuss this with him because he's
smarter than I am.

03:01:35.468 --> 03:01:37.080
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:39.615
LIAM: Okay, then roll again at advantage.

03:01:39.615 --> 03:01:42.168
LAURA: He only thinks he's smarter than you.

03:01:42.168 --> 03:01:44.193
TRAVIS: Yes, because I read.

03:01:44.193 --> 03:01:45.562
TJ: No, it's not as good.

03:01:45.562 --> 03:01:56.794
LIAM: Not as good. You've read similar names in
histories that touch on the nation of Xhorhas.

03:01:56.794 --> 03:01:58.742
TJ: Our enemy nation?

03:01:58.742 --> 03:01:59.767
LAURA: Ah!

03:01:59.767 --> 03:02:02.957
LIAM: That is correct. The country to the east.

03:02:02.957 --> 03:02:13.006
TJ: I mention this to everyone. It doesn't strike
any chords, though, beyond that.

03:02:13.006 --> 03:02:13.893
LIAM: No.

03:02:13.893 --> 03:02:17.701
TJ: I'll hand the thing back to you. Where did we
find this blade?

03:02:17.701 --> 03:02:22.077
SAM: It was in Aurra's room. It was in a bag. It
was no big deal.

03:02:22.077 --> 03:02:24.439
ERICA: In this pouch, with a familiar smell.

03:02:24.439 --> 03:02:28.407
SAM: Guys, you're making too much of it. There's
just some bad guys out there, we're going to kill

03:02:28.407 --> 03:02:30.494
them, then we're going to have the party that I
was promised.

03:02:30.494 --> 03:02:31.823
ERICA: Too much of it?

03:02:31.823 --> 03:02:32.550
SAM: What? Huh?

03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:37.598
ERICA: Katerine was murdered, our father has lost
a hand, and has been taken.

03:02:37.598 --> 03:02:45.396
TJ: The elves are an ancient people, and they know
magic well. If this is true, then they perhaps

03:02:45.396 --> 03:02:50.040
know that this dagger is coming to them. They know
when, and they know where. Perhaps.

03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:52.593
SAM: You want to get rid of it?

03:02:52.593 --> 03:02:56.364
TJ: I don't know. We might need it.

03:02:56.364 --> 03:02:57.102
TRAVIS: Huh.

03:02:57.102 --> 03:03:00.343
LIAM: So we're pausing at this crack in the wall,
I assume--

03:03:00.343 --> 03:03:02.357
LAURA: No, we're going in; and we're barging in!

03:03:02.357 --> 03:03:04.155
SAM: Oh gosh, she's freaking out.

03:03:04.155 --> 03:03:05.125
LAURA: (growling)

03:03:05.125 --> 03:03:12.895
LIAM: It's not that far. What starts-- I lost my
place here. It starts out as structured

03:03:12.895 --> 03:03:19.219
excavation. You can tell that this was dug out at
some point, what lays beyond this Cask of

03:03:19.219 --> 03:03:26.265
Amontillado-type wall. But it quickly gives way to
natural formations, opening into a substantial

03:03:26.265 --> 03:03:35.512
chamber ahead. It's a cave, and there are two
torches at the far end of it, flickering. The cave

03:03:35.512 --> 03:03:41.580
bisects though, not that far in front of you, and
it seems to split. As it opens up, there is a

03:03:41.580 --> 03:03:47.573
passage on your right. But your eyes are more
drawn, very obviously, very clearly, to the far

03:03:47.573 --> 03:03:56.204
end, where those torches burn. A tumble of stone
leads up to a slightly higher ledge; and you see a

03:03:56.204 --> 03:04:00.092
figure standing there, staring at you all as you
enter.

03:04:00.092 --> 03:04:04.246
LAURA: Do we recognize him? Her? Them?

03:04:04.246 --> 03:04:09.380
LIAM: Make an insight check.

03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:12.208
TJ: Can we do this as well?

03:04:12.208 --> 03:04:14.488
LIAM: You can. You both can.

03:04:14.488 --> 03:04:15.125
LAURA: 13.

03:04:22.605 --> 03:04:23.222
TJ: 14.

03:04:23.222 --> 03:04:37.075
LIAM: Okay. As you draw a little bit closer, he is
familiar. He is familiar. He's slender,

03:04:38.729 --> 03:04:52.243
youthful-looking. Dark, almost blue-hued skin. Of
course: sharp ears, sharp expression. The sides of

03:04:52.243 --> 03:04:59.561
his head are shorn, and there is a shock of white
hair, tied back. He is staring at you, and you,

03:04:59.561 --> 03:05:09.211
right now. He's wearing dark, oiled scale mail
with a single, chitinous pauldron on one shoulder.

03:05:09.211 --> 03:05:20.073
In his hand, there is a cruel-looking flail. Its
jagged edges are currently trailing down and

03:05:20.073 --> 03:05:28.277
wrapping around the neck of your father, who is
lying at his feet, breathing slowly.

03:05:28.277 --> 03:05:31.565
SAM and TRAVIS: (escalating growling)

03:05:31.565 --> 03:05:33.670
LIAM: He is about 100 feet away from you--

03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:35.460
LAURA: 100 feet away from us?

03:05:35.460 --> 03:05:38.591
LIAM: He is just deadpan staring at you all.

03:05:38.591 --> 03:05:41.173
SAM: I think I'm going to wolf out.

03:05:41.173 --> 03:05:42.927
TRAVIS: (growling) Me too!

03:05:42.927 --> 03:05:48.794
TRAVIS and SAM: (howling)

03:05:48.794 --> 03:05:49.889
LIAM: Okay.

03:05:49.889 --> 03:05:54.593
TJ: Can I pray while we're seeing this?

03:05:54.593 --> 03:06:01.354
LIAM: Yes, but, for the moment-- Big Man-- what's
your name, Chet? Tell me--

03:06:01.354 --> 03:06:04.274
SAM: Benicio.

03:06:04.274 --> 03:06:07.088
LIAM: What do you look like in werewolf form?

03:06:07.088 --> 03:06:12.200
SAM: My arms, from prior burning, don't really
have a lot of fur on them. They're mostly--

03:06:12.200 --> 03:06:13.257
LIAM: Scar tissue?

03:06:13.257 --> 03:06:15.142
SAM: Scar tissue and skin.

03:06:15.142 --> 03:06:16.940
LAURA: So it looks like little human arms?

03:06:16.940 --> 03:06:19.824
LIAM: They're bigger. They definitely get stronger
and ropier.

03:06:19.824 --> 03:06:21.711
LAURA: No, they definitely look like human arms.

03:06:21.711 --> 03:06:30.616
SAM: Then, the rest of me is-- You know black and
white cookies? So mostly white on this half,

03:06:30.616 --> 03:06:32.477
mostly black on this half.

03:06:32.477 --> 03:06:33.400
LAURA: That's cool!

03:06:33.400 --> 03:06:35.026
LIAM: Got it. Nice. Okay.

03:06:35.026 --> 03:06:36.983
SAM: Real matted and nasty.

03:06:36.983 --> 03:06:38.595
LIAM: So that's Benicio. Lawrence?

03:06:38.595 --> 03:06:45.929
TRAVIS: Yeah, as I start to Hulk out, I grab the
peppered sides of my hair and I pull, and split my

03:06:45.929 --> 03:06:55.322
face. And the wolf maw comes out of it. My head is
jet black with white racing stripes coming back

03:06:55.322 --> 03:06:56.659
from my eyes--

03:06:56.659 --> 03:06:57.441
SAM: Whoa!

03:06:57.441 --> 03:07:01.955
TRAVIS: But the black only extends to my
mid-sternum, where the rest of my body is peppered

03:07:01.955 --> 03:07:05.749
salty gray, black and white, and dappled spots.

03:07:05.749 --> 03:07:07.166
LAURA: That's cool.

03:07:07.166 --> 03:07:09.021
LIAM: Keg is aroused.

03:07:09.021 --> 03:07:16.573
SAM: I instinctively just sniff him all over the
place.

03:07:16.573 --> 03:07:20.428
TRAVIS: Not the nuts, not the nuts! (deep, wolf
voice) Not the nuts!

03:07:20.428 --> 03:07:22.260
LIAM: The twins go brotastic and you wanted to
do--

03:07:22.260 --> 03:07:23.652
LAURA: Do we start--

03:07:23.652 --> 03:07:27.382
LIAM: One second. Lucius, you wanted to say a
prayer, you said?

03:07:27.382 --> 03:07:30.562
TJ: Faerie Fire. Then I want to outline him--

03:07:30.562 --> 03:07:33.600
LIAM: What's the range?

03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:34.887
SAM: 90 feet?

03:07:34.887 --> 03:07:36.423
TJ: 60.

03:07:36.423 --> 03:07:41.241
LIAM: He's a little too far away, where you guys
are right now.

03:07:41.241 --> 03:07:42.549
TJ: Good enough. I'll wait.

03:07:42.549 --> 03:07:43.567
LIAM: Okay.

03:07:43.567 --> 03:07:45.238
LAURA: Can we start running towards him?

03:07:45.238 --> 03:07:46.206
LIAM: You want to charge?

03:07:46.206 --> 03:07:47.693
LAURA: I want to fucking charge him.

03:07:47.693 --> 03:07:48.975
LIAM: Fucking charge him, then.

03:07:48.975 --> 03:07:49.637
SAM: Wolf charge!

03:07:49.637 --> 03:07:52.182
LAURA: Yeah! Who's charging? Is anyone charging
with me?

03:07:52.182 --> 03:07:52.799
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:07:52.799 --> 03:07:55.115
SAM: (howling)

03:07:55.115 --> 03:08:02.079
LIAM: Okay. Fuck! Roll for initiative, everybody.
Bring it on out, Max, are you there? Holy cow!

03:08:02.079 --> 03:08:06.529
TJ: Instead of the prayer, since I couldn't do it,
can I throw the coin-- The light coin to the

03:08:06.529 --> 03:08:08.729
right? I just don't want that dark area.

03:08:08.729 --> 03:08:09.797
LIAM: Yes, you can.

03:08:09.797 --> 03:08:11.367
SAM: Ting, ting, ting!

03:08:11.367 --> 03:08:12.742
TJ: Whoa!

03:08:12.742 --> 03:08:15.130
LIAM: Okay. This is heavy.

03:08:15.130 --> 03:08:16.261
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

03:08:16.261 --> 03:08:17.308
SAM: This is a giant map!

03:08:17.308 --> 03:08:20.102
ERICA: Oh, I love it!

03:08:20.102 --> 03:08:25.590
LIAM: Earthquake. Okay, that goes there, that goes
there, that goes there.

03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:29.389
SAM: Where are we? Oh, we went through the hole?

03:08:29.389 --> 03:08:30.154
LIAM: No.

03:08:30.154 --> 03:08:31.094
SAM: What?

03:08:31.094 --> 03:08:43.643
LIAM: Okay, here is-- Where are we all? I'd say
then at this point then, you're here.

03:08:43.643 --> 03:08:44.692
TRAVIS: Who's that?

03:08:44.692 --> 03:08:47.729
LIAM: Oh, the twins were in front. So it's black
and red.

03:08:53.649 --> 03:08:56.703
SAM: We still have weapons and stuff, right?

03:08:57.254 --> 03:08:58.036
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:08:58.036 --> 03:08:59.427
LIAM: You are still in your human form, though,
yes?

03:08:59.427 --> 03:09:00.181
TJ: Yes.

03:09:00.181 --> 03:09:09.536
LIAM: Okay. Am I missing a wolf? Oh, here we are.

03:09:09.536 --> 03:09:13.379
LAURA: I think you can do three attacks with your
claws, and two attacks with your--

03:09:13.379 --> 03:09:19.279
LIAM: Okay. One second, everybody.

03:09:19.279 --> 03:09:21.659
SAM: What are you going to do?

03:09:21.659 --> 03:09:24.395
LAURA: I've got a thing.

03:09:24.395 --> 03:09:26.256
SAM: You've got a thing?

03:09:26.256 --> 03:09:28.165
ERICA: She's got a thing.

03:09:28.165 --> 03:09:30.673
LAURA: How far away from him are we now?

03:09:30.673 --> 03:09:40.909
LIAM: I'm going to say at this moment in time, in
lead (counting by fives), I'll put him at 50 feet.

03:09:40.909 --> 03:09:48.034
Did you all roll for initiative?

03:09:48.034 --> 03:09:48.576
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:48.576 --> 03:09:49.191
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:09:49.191 --> 03:09:57.764
LIAM: Let me roll for him. He is at-- where's my
stuff? Sorry, I did not think we were going to

03:09:57.764 --> 03:10:06.080
launch into this quite this fast. But that's fine.
That's great. No, not at all. Okay so, who got 20

03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:07.094
to 25?

03:10:07.094 --> 03:10:07.880
LAURA: 23.

03:10:07.880 --> 03:10:09.833
LIAM: 23. Portia in the lead again.

03:10:09.833 --> 03:10:11.109
SAM: 20 for me.

03:10:11.109 --> 03:10:12.234
LIAM: 20 for you? Benicio second place
again. Lawrence?

03:10:15.108 --> 03:10:15.989
TRAVIS: The exact same order so far.

03:10:16.871 --> 03:10:26.366
LIAM: Okay, that's right! After Lawrence,
what are your two rolls?

03:10:26.422 --> 03:10:27.794
TRAVIS: I rolled a 19.

03:10:27.794 --> 03:10:28.542
LIAM: Yeah?

03:10:28.542 --> 03:10:29.414
ERICA: 13.

03:10:29.414 --> 03:10:30.901
LIAM: 13?

03:10:30.901 --> 03:10:31.658
TJ: One.

03:10:31.658 --> 03:10:33.237
(laughter)

03:10:33.237 --> 03:10:36.467
TJ: I'm the worst ever!

03:10:36.467 --> 03:10:37.499
SAM: Well, you're not a wolf!

03:10:37.499 --> 03:10:39.298
LIAM: Luci. So I'm going to leave a big gap right here.

03:10:39.298 --> 03:10:42.194
SAM: It's the same exact order as last time!

03:10:42.194 --> 03:10:43.250
LAURA: That's crazy!

03:10:43.250 --> 03:10:46.150
LIAM: And you threw a coin and it
landed about here, I'll say.

03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:47.519
SAM: Ting, ting, ting!

03:10:47.519 --> 03:10:56.145
LIAM: All right. Portia, you are up. Just to
remind you what you're looking at, you're looking

03:10:56.145 --> 03:11:01.610
at a dark elf with a flail that is wrapped around
your father's neck.

03:11:01.610 --> 03:11:03.866
SAM: Oh god! He could kill Dad.

03:11:03.866 --> 03:11:06.113
LAURA: Oh god! I'm going to-- Oh,
god.

03:11:06.113 --> 03:11:09.547
LIAM: Where'd the music go, Mercer?

03:11:09.547 --> 03:11:14.682
LAURA: I can only hold an action, I can't hold a
whole move.

03:11:14.682 --> 03:11:18.096
LIAM: You can only hold an action.

03:11:18.096 --> 03:11:22.206
LAURA: But can I let someone go before me,
before I go?

03:11:22.206 --> 03:11:25.376
SAM: You can't pass.

03:11:25.376 --> 03:11:28.883
LIAM: No, you can't pass. You would lose until
the next time around.

03:11:28.944 --> 03:11:30.432
LAURA: Okay, which one am I?

03:11:30.493 --> 03:11:32.058
SAM: You're the wolf.

03:11:32.058 --> 03:11:39.492
LIAM: I color-coded you guys, okay? So
Benicio is black, Lawrence is red, Portia is

03:11:39.492 --> 03:11:43.133
blue, Lucius is yellow, and Aurra is
green.

03:11:43.133 --> 03:11:49.214
LAURA: Okay. How far away is Benny from
the baddie?

03:11:49.214 --> 03:11:50.452
LIAM: About 50 feet.

03:11:50.452 --> 03:11:56.995
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to run forward, to Benicio.

03:11:56.995 --> 03:12:02.465
LIAM: Okay. Ten, 15, okay.

03:12:02.465 --> 03:12:05.610
LAURA: I'm going to bonus action
Shared Passage.

03:12:05.610 --> 03:12:06.861
SAM: What's that?

03:12:06.861 --> 03:12:09.037
LAURA: That's the one where I can teleport 40 feet.

03:12:09.037 --> 03:12:11.977
TJ and SAM: What?!

03:12:11.977 --> 03:12:18.662
LAURA: I'm going to teleport 40 feet, and then I'm
going to run the last little bit up and attack him.

03:12:18.662 --> 03:12:20.360
LIAM: Okay, okay.

03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:21.854
LAURA: And I'm going to bring Benny with me.

03:12:21.854 --> 03:12:23.165
SAM: Wait, you can do that?

03:12:23.165 --> 03:12:25.099
LAURA: I bring somebody with me my size.

03:12:25.099 --> 03:12:31.746
LIAM: Oh man, this is why I said I didn't
want this. So: five, ten-- By the way, I told you

03:12:31.746 --> 03:12:36.052
guys this before, but I'll tell the audience. I
have no idea how to balance combat, so I don't

03:12:36.052 --> 03:12:43.663
really know what's going to happen. (counting by fives)

03:12:43.663 --> 03:12:45.114
LAURA: So we'll bamf to the end of the steps.

03:12:45.114 --> 03:12:46.006
LIAM: I'm going to say, yeah.

03:12:46.006 --> 03:12:49.009
LAURA: I'll run up the rest and attack him.

03:12:49.009 --> 03:12:51.424
LIAM: All right. What are you going to do?

03:12:51.424 --> 03:12:53.349
TRAVIS: Freak nasty!

03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:57.604
LAURA: Oh man! I'm going to hit him twice,
with the sword.

03:12:57.604 --> 03:12:59.101
LIAM: Go for it! Go for it.

03:12:59.101 --> 03:13:04.438
LAURA: I'm going to try to. Okay! 15 plus
nine.

03:13:04.438 --> 03:13:05.945
TRAVIS: Are you Crimson Rite-ing that sword?

03:13:05.945 --> 03:13:08.138
LAURA: No, because I already bonus
actioned to teleport.

03:13:08.208 --> 03:13:11.190
LIAM: 15 plus nine you said? Definitely hits.

03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:13.916
LAURA: Okay. And then--

03:13:13.916 --> 03:13:18.899
LIAM: Why does the music keep turning off,
Mercer?

03:13:18.899 --> 03:13:21.106
LAURA: 13 points on the first hit.

03:13:21.106 --> 03:13:24.771
LIAM: Holy schnikes.

03:13:24.771 --> 03:13:27.259
LAURA: Oh, natural one for the second.

03:13:27.259 --> 03:13:30.540
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to say on that second-- 
Hold on a second.

03:13:30.540 --> 03:13:38.894
TRAVIS: We're winning here, right? I'm happy.

03:13:38.894 --> 03:13:45.474
LIAM: The two wolves just disappear while
running and one of them just continues to Naruto

03:13:45.474 --> 03:13:52.406
run up the hill, comes forward with Vargr and
stabs straight into the drow. He is bewildered

03:13:52.406 --> 03:13:57.142
that this happens, that you are on him so quickly.
(choking gasp) You pull out to strike again, but

03:13:57.142 --> 03:14:03.118
your foot slides on some of the stones. It's just
a pile of loose rubble up to this ledge. And you

03:14:03.118 --> 03:14:07.936
go tumbling backwards, and fall prone and take--

03:14:07.936 --> 03:14:10.453
LAURA: Oh! Natural one really fucked me
there!

03:14:10.453 --> 03:14:15.256
LIAM: You take three points of bludgeoning
damage as you strike your shoulder hard into the

03:14:15.311 --> 03:14:20.946
stony ground. Benicio, it is your turn.

03:14:21.019 --> 03:14:28.291
SAM: I will run up the stairs. First of all, I'll be
like: How the fuck did I get here? Then I'll run

03:14:28.291 --> 03:14:33.119
up the stairs, with fury in my--

03:14:33.119 --> 03:14:34.294
TRAVIS: Bones!

03:14:34.294 --> 03:14:38.394
SAM: Eyes. And I'm going to grab Dad and pull
him.

03:14:38.394 --> 03:14:39.659
LIAM: You're going to pull him?

03:14:39.659 --> 03:14:42.632
SAM: I'm going to pull Dad. I'm going to grab Dad 
and try to pull him away.

03:14:42.632 --> 03:14:45.297
LIAM: Okay, make a strength check.

03:14:45.297 --> 03:14:50.215
LAURA: Oh no! But if the guy can hit him
it'll give him an attack of advantage or

03:14:50.215 --> 03:14:51.207
whatever!

03:14:51.207 --> 03:14:53.282
SAM: Strength check? Do I get more
strength?

03:14:53.282 --> 03:14:55.929
TRAVIS: You get advantage on your
strength checks.

03:14:55.929 --> 03:14:58.040
LIAM: Straight strength. Yeah.
As a werewolf, that is correct.

03:14:58.040 --> 03:14:59.260
LAURA: We lost our music again.

03:14:59.260 --> 03:15:02.083
LIAM: I guess this is the one that doesn't-- Just
doesn't work out.

03:15:02.083 --> 03:15:03.325
SAM: Does strength go up?

03:15:03.325 --> 03:15:04.845
TRAVIS: No, just plus one to your melee damage.

03:15:04.845 --> 03:15:06.115
SAM: Okay. 15.

03:15:06.115 --> 03:15:15.333
LIAM: That's fine. You yank your father away from
the man, and the barbed edges of the flail tear

03:15:15.419 --> 03:15:24.160
into his throat. He ragdolls away, and you hear a
brief (choking). He collapses onto the stone in

03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:26.743
front of you and is bleeding onto your feet.

03:15:26.743 --> 03:15:28.316
ERICA: Lovely.

03:15:28.316 --> 03:15:30.671
LAURA: What did you do?!

03:15:30.671 --> 03:15:37.365
SAM: Do I have him, or is he still wrapped up?

03:15:37.365 --> 03:15:49.066
LIAM: Yeah, it was laced-- You have him and the
flail is free. It wasn't tied in a knot. It was

03:15:49.066 --> 03:15:53.771
methodically wrapped around, and you have just
unraveled it like a ripcord.

03:15:53.771 --> 03:15:56.586
ERICA: Father! Benicio, stop!

03:15:56.586 --> 03:16:03.327
SAM: No one look at me! I'm going to keep dragging
him down the stairs.

03:16:03.327 --> 03:16:05.326
ERICA: Serious?

03:16:05.326 --> 03:16:07.166
SAM: Well, I got him free!

03:16:07.166 --> 03:16:10.970
LAURA: In my prone self, I see-- Dad. It's
terrible.

03:16:10.970 --> 03:16:14.011
LIAM: He is going to take a swipe at you with the
flail as you back up.

03:16:14.011 --> 03:16:20.340
TRAVIS: This is what happens when you take Benicio
instead of Lawrence, all right? You took the jughead.

03:16:20.340 --> 03:16:23.047
LAURA: He had my back in the cemetery.

03:16:23.047 --> 03:16:30.212
LIAM: What's your-- oh, I know what it is. It is
17. Yeah, you feel those same jagged edges on the

03:16:30.212 --> 03:16:55.359
flail rake across your own hairy chest. You take
five points of piercing damage and 15 points of

03:16:55.359 --> 03:16:58.956
poison damage from that.

03:16:58.956 --> 03:17:06.540
SAM: Wait, the piercing damage is halved because
I'm a werewolf. So it's only two points or three points?

03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:07.844
LIAM: We'll say two.

03:17:07.844 --> 03:17:11.396
SAM: Okay. Plus 15 points.

03:17:11.396 --> 03:17:17.234
LIAM: And you are poisoned. Well, actually, make a
constitution save.

03:17:17.234 --> 03:17:21.648
SAM: Constitution save, 19.

03:17:21.648 --> 03:17:32.116
LIAM: Okay. You feel burning inside the veins,
inside your body. Your chest starts to burn, and

03:17:32.116 --> 03:17:41.818
you roar. Benicio roars in this cave, and you
withstand the poison.

03:17:41.818 --> 03:17:45.119
SAM: (ululating)

03:17:45.119 --> 03:17:53.108
LIAM: By trololo-ing. You wanted to back up a bit,
right? I'd say you get back down to the bottom of

03:17:53.108 --> 03:18:01.660
the hill. He looks flummoxed, let's say. The dark
elf. Anything else? You're out of juice, right?

03:18:01.660 --> 03:18:03.249
Lawrence, you're up.

03:18:03.249 --> 03:18:10.374
TRAVIS: Does our speed increase as werewolves? No,
it doesn't, does it? My fucking siblings

03:18:10.374 --> 03:18:19.457
disappear, and I'm like: Ruh-roh! Watching all
that happen in two six-second, back-to-back

03:18:19.457 --> 03:18:28.426
periods, and not being able to close the distance
in 30 feet, I will run into that cove.

03:18:28.426 --> 03:18:32.280
LIAM: Okay. (counting) This one right here?

03:18:32.280 --> 03:18:38.306
TRAVIS: Yeah. With my bonus action, I will cast
Crimson Rite on my claws.

03:18:38.306 --> 03:18:44.277
LIAM: Awesome. Great. So you take 1d6 damage
outright? Or not 1d6, just six.

03:18:44.277 --> 03:18:45.672
TRAVIS: Six total, yeah.

03:18:45.672 --> 03:18:47.533
LIAM: What are you imbuing them with?

03:18:47.533 --> 03:18:49.623
TRAVIS: Lightning damage.

03:18:49.623 --> 03:18:52.753
LIAM: Lightning? Saucy. Okay.

03:18:52.753 --> 03:18:58.407
SAM: Always the weakling coward, Lawrence. Hiding
in a cove.

03:18:58.407 --> 03:18:59.816
TRAVIS: Shut up!

03:18:59.816 --> 03:19:03.473
SAM: I went in and killed Dad, like a real brave
guy!

03:19:03.473 --> 03:19:11.360
TRAVIS: Your sister helped you! You didn't know
what happened. You just showed up there. I saw it

03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:15.146
in your face! (deep voice) I saw it in your face.

03:19:15.146 --> 03:19:28.370
LIAM: Next up is this stranger. You've got Dad
down here and he shouts out, "Kill them!" He backs

03:19:28.370 --> 03:19:42.310
up and crouches a bit behind this broken stone
box. He mutters something quietly behind, and a

03:19:42.310 --> 03:19:56.007
dark, glowing bluish-purple, jagged spear appears
above his head and starts to angle towards you all.

03:19:56.007 --> 03:19:57.952
LAURA: What is that?

03:19:57.952 --> 03:19:59.444
TRAVIS: Not good.

03:19:59.444 --> 03:20:05.078
SAM: No, I think it's fine. Is this part of the
party?

03:20:05.078 --> 03:20:10.220
LIAM: I got to look something up, but next up is
Aurra. Aurra, be thinking what you want to do

03:20:10.220 --> 03:20:12.820
really quick. I'll be right with you.

03:20:12.820 --> 03:20:23.756
SAM: Our father is dying. Or dead, so if there's
any way to, you know, not make him--

03:20:23.756 --> 03:20:29.411
LIAM: I'm going to slightly adjust the description
of that. That jagged spear appears floating right

03:20:29.411 --> 03:20:35.346
in front of you, Benicio, and on its own goes
(whoosh) and shudders toward you.

03:20:35.346 --> 03:20:37.400
LAURA: It's a Spiritual Weapon.

03:20:37.400 --> 03:20:44.026
LIAM: You crouch down and cower-- not cower, but
protect your father's body, and the spear strikes

03:20:44.026 --> 03:20:51.774
the stone behind you, then retracts up into the
air and quivers in the air above you. Now, Aurra,

03:20:51.774 --> 03:20:53.294
you are up.

03:20:53.294 --> 03:20:56.658
ERICA: So the sphere is still aimed at my
brother?

03:20:56.658 --> 03:20:58.083
LIAN: Spear, yeah.

03:20:58.083 --> 03:21:05.612
ERICA: Spear, thank you. I would like to use Haste
to get to him.

03:21:05.612 --> 03:21:07.246
LIAM: So you're going to cast Haste on yourself?

03:21:07.246 --> 03:21:08.846
ERICA: I'm going to cast Haste on myself, yes.

03:21:08.846 --> 03:21:17.175
LIAM: Okay. All right, you do that. No, you don't
need to roll at all. The hair all over your body

03:21:17.175 --> 03:21:26.107
starts to prickle and stand on end, and you feel
your tendons twist and tighten, and you are now

03:21:26.107 --> 03:21:31.679
the fastest wolf on earth. So, where're we going?

03:21:31.679 --> 03:21:33.819
ERICA: I'm going to Benicio. Yep.

03:21:33.819 --> 03:21:42.682
LIAM: 50. Here, or where? Because you got some
more left. You got maybe two more squares, ten

03:21:42.682 --> 03:21:43.453
more feet.

03:21:43.453 --> 03:21:48.150
ERICA: I want to be right up on him. Am I on him?
Where's my father in this scenario?

03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:50.166
LIAM: He's on the other side of Benicio.

03:21:50.166 --> 03:21:52.796
TRAVIS: Could you get between him and <i>el</i> spear?

03:21:52.796 --> 03:21:59.617
LIAM: I'm going to say no, you can't. I'm going to
say that they're in a pile. We've got brother,

03:21:59.617 --> 03:22:06.476
sister, father, all in a little heap here. Because
you're on your back, Dad's not good, and you're

03:22:06.476 --> 03:22:08.659
standing but crouching over him.

03:22:08.659 --> 03:22:10.295
ERICA: The spear has missed him.

03:22:16.095 --> 03:22:17.567
SAM: Save Dad.

03:22:17.567 --> 03:22:23.843
LIAM: Don't forget, your AC is now higher because
of that, so you're harder to hit. And you have an

03:22:24.097 --> 03:22:29.824
extra action. Which you could use to move, if you
wanted to go further. Erica, if you want to go further.

03:22:29.824 --> 03:22:33.532
ERICA: I want to go to my father.

03:22:33.532 --> 03:22:37.308
LIAM: So maybe get in front of him?

03:22:37.308 --> 03:22:38.882
ERICA: Yes, in front of him.

03:22:38.882 --> 03:22:43.526
LIAM: So here? Definitely. If you use your hasted
action, which you now have, to stand in his way.

03:22:43.526 --> 03:22:45.934
SAM: She's got one additional action to use?

03:22:45.934 --> 03:22:52.799
LIAM: That's it. She used her double movement to
get where she was-- Oh, you've got so much to do.

03:22:52.799 --> 03:22:58.242
You used your doubled movement to get that far,
you just used your action or your hasted action to

03:22:58.242 --> 03:23:00.075
get even further. You have an action left.

03:23:00.075 --> 03:23:02.529
LAURA: But her action originally was to cast
Haste.

03:23:02.529 --> 03:23:04.048
LIAM: You're right.

03:23:04.048 --> 03:23:06.712
ERICA: So no, I don't.

03:23:06.712 --> 03:23:10.046
LIAM: Movement, action, double-movement--

03:23:10.046 --> 03:23:12.975
LAURA: Action, action, action, action, bonus
action, action.

03:23:12.975 --> 03:23:16.319
LIAM: Hey, Vax. You are done. You are, in fact,
done. Unless you had something else?

03:23:16.319 --> 03:23:17.859
SAM: Bonus action?

03:23:17.859 --> 03:23:21.192
ERICA: Ooh, I do have Healing Word!

03:23:21.192 --> 03:23:22.513
LIAM: Is that a bonus action?

03:23:22.513 --> 03:23:23.733
ERICA: It is a bonus action.

03:23:23.733 --> 03:23:25.875
LIAM: Yeah, then you can do that.

03:23:25.875 --> 03:23:29.779
LAURA: Isn't it a spell, though? You can't do two
spells in one turn.

03:23:29.779 --> 03:23:33.796
SAM: Matt usually lets us do Healing Word.

03:23:33.796 --> 03:23:36.391
ERICA: It's a level one. I don't know, does that
make a difference?

03:23:36.391 --> 03:23:38.963
LIAM: Yeah, it was level one or below.

03:23:38.963 --> 03:23:43.533
SAM: If you cast a higher level spell for your
action, you can use a level one spell.

03:23:43.533 --> 03:23:48.315
LIAM: I'm going to use a rule called "fuck it."
I'm going to use the "fuck it" rule. Healing Word.

03:23:48.315 --> 03:23:50.969
ERICA: Fuck it? Healing Word, then, on my father.

03:23:50.969 --> 03:23:52.691
LIAM: If ever there was a moment, it is now.

03:23:52.691 --> 03:23:53.852
ERICA: I'm Healing Wording my father.

03:23:53.852 --> 03:23:57.309
LIAM: The wording on the spell is it's 1d4, I
think?

03:23:57.309 --> 03:24:01.609
ERICA: It's 1d4, yeah, plus my spellcasting
ability modifier.

03:24:01.609 --> 03:24:09.227
LIAM: Which is wisdom, so roll the pyramid plus--
no, not that one, the pyramid. One.

03:24:09.227 --> 03:24:12.067
ERICA: One plus four. All right.

03:24:12.067 --> 03:24:19.495
LIAM: Okay, the holes that were raked across your
father's neck close, and the bleeding stops, and

03:24:19.495 --> 03:24:25.238
he goes (gasping), "Stop!" That is the end of your
turn.

03:24:29.708 --> 03:24:31.982
LIAM: Lucius, it is your turn.

03:24:42.769 --> 03:24:50.008
TJ: I'm going to press myself against that wall,
just in case whoever he said "kill them" to comes

03:24:50.580 --> 03:24:58.089
flying around the corner. I don't want them to see
me. I reach out and throw Silence on the area

03:24:58.089 --> 03:24:59.808
where he is.

03:24:59.808 --> 03:25:04.763
LIAM: Oh, nice. Okay, so this whole back chamber,
done and done.

03:25:04.763 --> 03:25:07.064
TRAVIS: Nice call. Shit.

03:25:07.064 --> 03:25:09.240
LIAM: That's the end of your turn?

03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:14.591
TJ: Then perceive the area, because I want to know
what's coming for us.

03:25:14.591 --> 03:25:27.492
LIAM: All of you, from off on your right, suddenly
hear thick metal being dragged along stone. Didn't

03:25:27.492 --> 03:25:33.826
focus on it before, but from out of a deep recess
in the wall, dark with shadow, steps a ghastly,

03:25:33.826 --> 03:25:46.541
maybe ten-foot-tall figure of darkened bone,
brown, almost black. Tattered, decaying robes in a

03:25:46.541 --> 03:25:55.586
faded ghost of the traditional Lorelei green
drapes around its scraping, lumbering hips. A

03:25:55.586 --> 03:26:05.375
massive, canine skull stares at you, its eye
sockets seeping black, inky horror. A jawbone of

03:26:05.375 --> 03:26:13.231
ragged teeth widened beyond comprehension, black
mist or smoke spilling out in place of a tongue,

03:26:13.231 --> 03:26:15.922
long since rotted away.

03:26:15.922 --> 03:26:19.391
TRAVIS: I'm so excited right now! I feel aroused!

03:26:19.391 --> 03:26:22.419
LIAM: Siblings, meet your grandmother.

03:26:22.419 --> 03:26:26.597
TRAVIS: Ah, Grandma! What fucking gnarly teeth you
have!

03:26:26.597 --> 03:26:34.389
SAM: So Liam. If we can't hear, did we see that
happen?

03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:45.642
LIAM: Silence is here. She is going to use her
action to get closer.

03:26:45.642 --> 03:26:47.609
LAURA: Oh no!

03:26:47.609 --> 03:26:51.059
TJ: I flatten myself against the wall!

03:26:51.059 --> 03:26:53.336
SAM: Oma?

03:26:53.336 --> 03:27:06.274
LIAM: Her head stretches down at the two of you.
But for now, it is your turn, Portia.

03:27:06.274 --> 03:27:08.524
SAM: Kill Grandma!

03:27:08.524 --> 03:27:11.532
TRAVIS: I just wrote, "Grandma" in the initiative
order.

03:27:11.532 --> 03:27:13.969
LAURA: Oh god. Okay.

03:27:13.969 --> 03:27:17.662
SAM: Oh yeah, where is she?

03:27:17.662 --> 03:27:19.695
LAURA: Well, from the ground, I'm going to-- oh
god!

03:27:19.695 --> 03:27:21.307
LIAM: She slipped into Jester.

03:27:21.307 --> 03:27:22.056
SAM: Wrong character.

03:27:22.056 --> 03:27:39.955
LAURA: (as Jester) Technically, I'm really nervous
right now. (as Laura) Okay. Because I'm on the

03:27:39.955 --> 03:27:43.724
ground, I guess I'm going to Crimson Rite myself?

03:27:43.724 --> 03:27:48.553
LIAM: Your clawsies? They're a weapon,
absolutely.

03:27:48.553 --> 03:27:52.188
LAURA: But are they as good as my sword, though?
How much damage do they do?

03:27:52.188 --> 03:28:00.628
LIAM: Well, I will say this. Technically, in your
werewolf form, at your level, you can, as an

03:28:00.628 --> 03:28:07.184
action, attack-attack with claws and with a bonus
action, attack. So you got three claws. Whereas if

03:28:07.184 --> 03:28:10.320
you use your sword, it's just sword swipe, sword
swipe, done.

03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:12.850
LAURA: But my sword does more damage.

03:28:12.850 --> 03:28:15.406
TRAVIS: What damage die does your sword do?
Eight?

03:28:15.406 --> 03:28:21.046
LAURA: 1d10, it says. Why does this say 1d10 plus
four under it?

03:28:21.046 --> 03:28:28.990
SAM: With claws, you're going to get 3d6 plus
five. No, 3d6 plus 15.

03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:35.655
LIAM: Three chances to hit. Beefed up with Crimson
Rite.

03:28:35.655 --> 03:28:38.153
TRAVIS: Besides, you're a fucking werewolf! Let
her have it!

03:28:38.153 --> 03:28:40.488
LIAM: Do what feels right. Get feral, Laura!

03:28:40.488 --> 03:28:45.197
LAURA: Okay! I'm going to attack her with my claws.
I'm going to Rite of Passage on my claws!

03:28:45.197 --> 03:28:47.106
LIAM: Which is the bonus action?

03:28:47.106 --> 03:28:48.144
LAURA: Bonus action!

03:28:48.144 --> 03:28:51.988
LIAM: So this time you get two claw swipes,
because you used the bonus action to do it. So you

03:28:52.385 --> 03:28:56.636
take six points of damage. What are you imbuing
your claws with?

03:28:56.636 --> 03:29:04.971
LAURA: Storm damage as well! Light-en-ing damage.
Then I'm going to stand up.

03:29:04.971 --> 03:29:10.318
LIAM: Okay. You use half your movement to stand.

03:29:10.318 --> 03:29:14.465
LAURA: As I stand, I'm going to--

03:29:14.465 --> 03:29:20.435
LIAM: Roll. Slash her. Protect your father.
Protect your family line.

03:29:20.435 --> 03:29:23.027
LAURA: 14 plus seven?

03:29:23.027 --> 03:29:24.066
LIAM: Hits.

03:29:28.076 --> 03:29:32.323
LIAM: Why don't you roll both of your attacks
first, to see if they hit.

03:29:32.323 --> 03:29:34.192
LAURA: Okay. 12 plus seven. 19.

03:29:34.780 --> 03:29:36.060
LIAM: 19? Just hits.

03:29:36.060 --> 03:29:45.168
LAURA: Okay. So then it's what plus-- what do I
roll? A d6? Plus a d6?

03:29:45.168 --> 03:29:50.358
LIAM: My gosh, I don't have it in front of me. Oh,
because you don't have your shit. You don't have

03:29:50.358 --> 03:29:51.952
your character sheet in front of you, right?

03:29:51.952 --> 03:29:52.817
LAURA: No, I do!

03:29:52.817 --> 03:29:53.661
LIAM: Oh, you got it?

03:29:53.661 --> 03:29:55.447
LAURA: Yeah. It's just an unarmed strike?

03:29:55.447 --> 03:29:58.340
LIAM: It's an unarmed strike, but it's 1d6 as a
werewolf claw.

03:29:58.340 --> 03:30:03.264
SAM: You had told us in an email that she gets 1d6
plus five and we get 1d6 plus four.

03:30:03.264 --> 03:30:07.030
LIAM: Because of her strength modifier, right. 1d6
plus five, plus your strength modifier, plus your

03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:08.481
lightning damage.

03:30:08.481 --> 03:30:13.635
LAURA: Okay, cool. Ooh, ten plus five. So 15 on
the first attack.

03:30:13.635 --> 03:30:17.276
SAM: But some of that she must have resistance
to.

03:30:17.276 --> 03:30:19.155
TRAVIS: We're going to find out.

03:30:19.155 --> 03:30:21.521
LAURA: Then 11 on the second one.

03:30:21.521 --> 03:30:22.284
LIAM: Okay.

03:30:22.284 --> 03:30:27.214
SAM: Math is the worst part.

03:30:27.214 --> 03:30:29.320
LAURA: Mathis. What's mathis?

03:30:29.320 --> 03:30:34.404
SAM: Maths. Johnny Maths.

03:30:37.434 --> 03:30:42.862
LIAM: We're on you, Benicio. Oh, no, I'm sorry,
she's going to use one of--

03:30:43.268 --> 03:30:45.275
LAURA: Wait, but I stand up. Can I--? I'm
standing.

03:30:45.275 --> 03:30:47.337
LIAM: Yeah. And?

03:30:47.337 --> 03:30:48.685
LAURA: Can I stand up?

03:30:48.685 --> 03:30:52.038
LIAM: Oh, sure, stand your mini up, yes.

03:30:52.038 --> 03:30:52.889
LAURA: Okay.

03:30:52.889 --> 03:31:07.993
LIAM: Yes. Shoot. Okay. She's going to use one of
her legendary actions to slash the shit out of Portia.

03:31:07.993 --> 03:31:09.613
LAURA: Oh no.

03:31:09.613 --> 03:31:11.336
LIAM: And does hit. You take--

03:31:11.336 --> 03:31:15.685
LAURA: What does she roll? I have 17 AC.

03:31:15.685 --> 03:31:16.971
LIAM: She got a 19.

03:31:16.971 --> 03:31:18.932
LAURA: Damn it.

03:31:18.932 --> 03:31:25.876
LIAM: You take 13 points of slashing damage from
Genevieve Lorelei.

03:31:25.876 --> 03:31:31.583
LAURA: Genevieve is one of my favorite names, too!
What?

03:31:31.583 --> 03:31:32.850
SAM: You're a werewolf.

03:31:32.850 --> 03:31:34.539
LAURA: Oh, so I have resistance!

03:31:34.539 --> 03:31:37.701
SAM: Slashing, piercing and bludgeoning is reduced
by half.

03:31:37.701 --> 03:31:39.154
LAURA: Okay.

03:31:39.154 --> 03:31:41.170
TJ: Oh, that's nice.

03:31:41.170 --> 03:31:43.392
LAURA: You said 13?

03:31:43.392 --> 03:31:45.521
LIAM: I've added her to the playing field.

03:31:45.521 --> 03:31:47.994
TRAVIS: Yeah, her claws aren't considered
magical.

03:31:47.994 --> 03:31:51.201
SAM: Iron Woe? What does that even mean?

03:31:51.201 --> 03:31:54.532
TRAVIS: No, it's not Woe-- it's Iron Hoe.

03:31:54.532 --> 03:31:56.313
LAURA, SAM, and ERICA: Oh.

03:31:56.313 --> 03:31:58.983
ERICA: Which makes all the sense.

03:31:58.983 --> 03:32:03.041
LIAM: We're done there. Now we're onto Benicio.

03:32:03.041 --> 03:32:05.383
SAM: Benicio!

03:32:05.383 --> 03:32:06.632
LIAM: Yeah.

03:32:06.632 --> 03:32:09.520
SAM: I attack Grandma.

03:32:09.520 --> 03:32:10.985
LIAM: Go for it.

03:32:10.985 --> 03:32:17.897
SAM: Yeah, with glaive action. Ooh, that's no
good. That's only 15 to hit.

03:32:17.897 --> 03:32:20.024
LIAM: She strikes it out of the way.

03:32:20.024 --> 03:32:22.014
LAURA: Oh no.

03:32:22.014 --> 03:32:23.416
SAM: Meemaw?

03:32:23.416 --> 03:32:30.326
LIAM: There is a seeping, bleeding black cloud
pouring out of her eyes and mouth as she stares

03:32:30.326 --> 03:32:36.255
down at you. So used to staring down at others and
she is so much bigger than you.

03:32:36.255 --> 03:32:40.062
SAM: Attack again! 21.

03:32:40.062 --> 03:32:41.710
LIAM: Hits!

03:32:41.710 --> 03:32:52.667
SAM: Yeah! Okay, that is 13 points of damage. I
don't know how much of that she actually takes.

03:32:52.667 --> 03:32:59.024
Five points of those are fire damage and eight of
them are slashing.

03:32:59.024 --> 03:33:01.416
LIAM: Got it.

03:33:01.416 --> 03:33:08.136
SAM: Then with my bonus action, since I am a
polearm master, I will hit her with the back of

03:33:08.136 --> 03:33:09.829
the weapon as well.

03:33:09.829 --> 03:33:10.877
LIAM: It's a bonus?

03:33:10.877 --> 03:33:12.041
SAM: It's a bonus attack.

03:33:12.041 --> 03:33:13.695
LIAM: Fun, fun, fun.

03:33:13.695 --> 03:33:17.715
SAM: Which is only 16 to hit. Fail.

03:33:17.715 --> 03:33:30.088
LIAM: Yeah, she claws it out of the air and goes
to roar in your face and you hear (growling). Not

03:33:30.088 --> 03:33:36.296
a full roar, but unsettling nonetheless. Anything
else? Movement?

03:33:36.296 --> 03:33:39.493
SAM: No, I'll stay put; guard Dad.

03:33:39.493 --> 03:33:40.805
LIAM: Lawrence?

03:33:40.805 --> 03:33:43.696
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll run into the fray. 30 feet.

03:33:43.696 --> 03:33:46.698
LIAM: (counting) You want to come up behind her?

03:33:47.237 --> 03:33:51.652
TRAVIS: Yeah. Flank her. Flank, please, yes. I'll
take all three claw attacks.

03:33:51.652 --> 03:33:53.160
LIAM: All at advantage.

03:33:53.160 --> 03:33:54.545
TRAVIS: All at advantage?

03:33:54.545 --> 03:33:55.185
LIAM: Yeah.

03:33:55.185 --> 03:33:58.006
TRAVIS: Natural 20 for the first one.

03:33:58.006 --> 03:33:59.928
LIAM and LAURA: Ooh!

03:33:59.928 --> 03:34:02.006
TRAVIS: Second one is a 24.

03:34:02.006 --> 03:34:03.043
LIAM: Hits.

03:34:03.043 --> 03:34:06.522
TRAVIS: And that one is also a 24.

03:34:06.522 --> 03:34:07.857
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

03:34:07.857 --> 03:34:10.274
TRAVIS: Really amazing rolls.

03:34:10.274 --> 03:34:12.081
LAURA: Damn, I really should have grabbed
Lawrence.

03:34:12.081 --> 03:34:19.571
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll do the non-crits first. Seven
and four is 11 points on the first one, including

03:34:19.571 --> 03:34:24.767
the lightning damage. Five and four is nine.

03:34:24.767 --> 03:34:26.920
LAURA: Did you crit yourself on the first one?

03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:30.263
TRAVIS: No, I'm doing that one now. That's
(counting)

03:34:30.263 --> 03:34:32.147
SAM: Claw attacks are with advantage?

03:34:32.147 --> 03:34:33.417
LIAM: No, he's flanking.

03:34:33.417 --> 03:34:34.463
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:34:34.463 --> 03:34:38.027
TRAVIS: 17 points with lightning damage on the
crit.

03:34:38.027 --> 03:34:47.018
LIAM: Ooh! Okay, Lawrence comes running up, arms
behind him, and leaps on the back of his

03:34:47.018 --> 03:34:56.427
grandmother and tears. The bone does not feel like
bone, it feels like petrified wood. It feels like

03:34:56.427 --> 03:35:02.230
on the verge of stone, but you drag your claws
down and pull. It's like sparks coming out from

03:35:02.230 --> 03:35:08.680
under your claws as you-- her bones are hardened
and heavy and not what you expected.

03:35:08.680 --> 03:35:11.170
TRAVIS: Almost like iron?

03:35:11.170 --> 03:35:12.298
LIAM: Whoa!

03:35:12.298 --> 03:35:15.884
(laughter)

03:35:15.884 --> 03:35:31.901
LIAM: Okay. It is the dark elf's turn. One sec, I
got to look something up; I got to do it.

03:35:31.901 --> 03:35:33.297
SAM: No, you don't.

03:35:33.297 --> 03:35:35.412
LIAM: Yes, I do. I'm doing all the things.

03:35:35.412 --> 03:35:36.328
LAURA: Just make it up.

03:35:36.328 --> 03:35:38.108
LIAM: No, I can't make this one up. Can't do it.

03:35:38.108 --> 03:35:42.924
LAURA: So, check out that store (mumbling).

03:35:42.924 --> 03:35:46.762
SAM: shop.critrole.com? Is that what it is?

03:35:46.762 --> 03:35:53.592
SAM: Guys, at the end of the night tonight, you've
got to get some swag. It's a must.

03:35:53.592 --> 03:35:55.554
TRAVIS: We have extra toilet paper to hand out.

03:35:55.554 --> 03:36:02.362
LAURA: Do you have any more Twizzlers? Can I have
one of those?

03:36:02.362 --> 03:36:05.534
TRAVIS: They're not Twizzlers. They're probably
Costco, third-party brand red--

03:36:05.534 --> 03:36:08.846
ERICA: You are hoarding all of the reds. All of
the reds are being hoarded.

03:36:08.846 --> 03:36:17.375
LIAM: The thin and ropey dark elf runs out of this
upper chamber, leaps down and drops down by Aurra

03:36:17.375 --> 03:36:25.529
on the ground and he gets as low as he can in a
squat. You hear (chanting). You don't see him anymore.

03:36:25.529 --> 03:36:28.383
TRAVIS: Oh shit. He got out of the Silence?

03:36:28.383 --> 03:36:31.393
LAURA: Oh, that's what you were looking up.

03:36:31.393 --> 03:36:32.398
LIAM: Yes.

03:36:32.398 --> 03:36:39.152
SAM: You can't cast without-- If it was a verbal
spell--

03:36:39.152 --> 03:36:41.257
LIAM: Okay.

03:36:41.257 --> 03:36:44.924
SAM: Oh boy, we're in it now, guys.

03:36:44.924 --> 03:36:52.664
LIAM: The Iron Woe is going to whip around--

03:36:52.664 --> 03:36:55.603
SAM: (baby voice) The Iron Woe.

03:36:58.163 --> 03:37:06.554
LIAM: Turning towards the grandchild that just
hurt her so badly. She's going to rake her claw

03:37:06.691 --> 03:37:19.889
against you, Lawrence. For 22. You take 12 points
of slashing damage and then she--

03:37:19.889 --> 03:37:24.730
TRAVIS: Halved because her claws aren't magical?
Or are they silvered or magical?

03:37:24.730 --> 03:37:27.511
LIAM: They're magical.

03:37:27.511 --> 03:37:29.967
TRAVIS: Okay, 12 points, got it.

03:37:29.967 --> 03:37:39.101
LIAM: Then she-- that giant, gaping, hanging,
walling mouth lunges down and-- your AC is what again?

03:37:39.660 --> 03:37:40.713
TRAVIS: 16.

03:37:40.713 --> 03:37:50.055
LIAM: Snaps just shy of your face. You yank back
at the last second, almost lose your footing,

03:37:50.055 --> 03:37:53.242
almost do that, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!" thing, but
stay up.

03:37:53.242 --> 03:37:55.294
SAM: Are you going to barf?

03:37:55.294 --> 03:37:57.516
ERICA: Breathe deeply!

03:37:57.516 --> 03:38:04.777
LIAM: She snorts through her nose-- or the holes
in the skull-- and a big poof of (smoke rushing)

03:38:04.777 --> 03:38:08.479
in your face. It clings to you for a second and
then dissipates.

03:38:08.479 --> 03:38:11.645
TRAVIS: (coughing and wheezing).

03:38:11.645 --> 03:38:13.343
LAURA: What was that?

03:38:13.343 --> 03:38:15.530
LIAM: Now it is Aurra's turn.

03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:17.522
SAM: Come on, Aurra.

03:38:17.522 --> 03:38:23.698
LIAM: Oh, I'm going to retroactively do something,
too. The spear is still floating in the air and it

03:38:23.698 --> 03:38:33.369
flies in an arc over and goes in a circle and
strikes into Portia.

03:38:33.369 --> 03:38:34.349
LAURA: Me?

03:38:34.349 --> 03:38:36.569
ERICA: For the love of god.

03:38:36.569 --> 03:38:41.112
LIAM: That is a 22.

03:38:41.112 --> 03:38:43.129
LAURA: That hits me.

03:38:43.129 --> 03:38:46.357
LIAM: Okay, and that is-- I really got to write
this down--

03:38:46.357 --> 03:38:48.624
SAM: Boy, Portia. You might die.

03:38:48.624 --> 03:38:50.133
LAURA: I might.

03:38:50.133 --> 03:38:52.160
SAM: You might straight up die.

03:38:52.160 --> 03:38:53.859
LIAM: That is six points of damage.

03:38:53.859 --> 03:38:56.091
LAURA: But that's-- oh, that is magical.

03:38:56.091 --> 03:38:58.025
LIAM: Necrotic damage, yeah.

03:38:58.025 --> 03:38:59.386
TRAVIS: At the start of our turn--

03:38:59.386 --> 03:39:00.966
LAURA: That fucking necrotic damage.

03:39:00.966 --> 03:39:03.280
TRAVIS: Those of us in wolf form, we got to do
that wisdom check.

03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:04.543
SAM: Oh, we all took damage.

03:39:04.543 --> 03:39:06.312
LIAM: Yeah, who all took damage?

03:39:06.312 --> 03:39:07.402
SAM: I think I took damage.

03:39:07.402 --> 03:39:08.536
LIAM: You took damage.

03:39:08.536 --> 03:39:10.317
TRAVIS: At the start of your turn, if you've taken
damage, yeah.

03:39:10.317 --> 03:39:14.002
LIAM: Yeah, you three have to roll and see if you
can keep control of yourselves.

03:39:14.002 --> 03:39:15.091
LAURA: Oh, shit.

03:39:15.091 --> 03:39:16.166
SAM: That's right.

03:39:16.166 --> 03:39:18.057
LAURA: How do we know what's going to--

03:39:18.057 --> 03:39:21.917
LIAM: We'll get to that. Aurra, it is your turn at
bat.

03:39:21.917 --> 03:39:24.467
SAM: You have to know how much damage you took,
too.

03:39:24.467 --> 03:39:25.339
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:39:25.339 --> 03:39:29.664
LIAM: DC of ten or half the damage you took.

03:39:29.664 --> 03:39:37.983
ERICA: Where am I relative to Portia right now?
I'm up there, right? And where is she?

03:39:37.983 --> 03:39:42.968
LIAM: Portia is here.

03:39:42.968 --> 03:39:45.210
ERICA: Is there. Okay.

03:39:45.210 --> 03:39:51.981
LAURA: Six? Did I take six points from that
spear?

03:39:51.981 --> 03:40:00.388
LIAM: Also, Aurra, I should say this, too. The
dark elf landed right next to you and then almost

03:40:00.388 --> 03:40:06.758
instantaneously went (fwoosh) and vanished
next to you. But you felt a bump or a brush

03:40:06.758 --> 03:40:12.233
against your shoulder-- you felt momentum running
past you-- and you can tell that he's running past

03:40:12.233 --> 03:40:17.202
you right now. You get what's called an attack of
opportunity. It's at disadvantage because he's

03:40:17.202 --> 03:40:20.719
fucking invisible, but roll to see if you can
swipe at him.

03:40:20.719 --> 03:40:26.394
SAM: By attack, it's a physical attack. Like, you
hit. Not with a spell.

03:40:26.394 --> 03:40:30.555
ERICA: To see if I can somehow hit him despite the
fact that he is fleeing rapidly.

03:40:30.555 --> 03:40:34.160
LIAM: Well, you just felt (thumping). So, if you
are quick enough, you roll twice--

03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:36.217
LAURA: Ooh, that's good, okay.

03:40:36.217 --> 03:40:37.752
LIAM: --and take the lower.

03:40:37.752 --> 03:40:42.234
ERICA: The lower at disadvantage. Okay, darn it.
That's a four.

03:40:42.234 --> 03:40:43.118
LAURA: Plus...

03:40:43.118 --> 03:40:45.805
ERICA: Plus-- wait, what am I doing? What is the
thing?

03:40:45.805 --> 03:40:47.150
LAURA: Plus five.

03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:53.167
SAM: It's nine.

03:40:53.167 --> 03:40:55.307
LIAM: You feel a hint of fabric on the edges of
your claw... and then nothing. Okay, now it's your

03:40:55.307 --> 03:40:56.298
full-on turn, so forget that.

03:40:58.169 --> 03:41:00.974
ERICA: How badly are you injured again? Are you
near death? What is going on?

03:41:00.974 --> 03:41:02.204
LAURA: No, no, no. Do--

03:41:02.204 --> 03:41:04.505
TRAVIS: (harsh, deep whisper) I catch it on my
face. I have shit <i>on</i> my face.

03:41:04.505 --> 03:41:09.430
ERICA. You're not-- Do the thing? Do the other
things? I'm going to do the other things.

03:41:09.781 --> 03:41:12.236
TRAVIS: In, on, and around my face.

03:41:12.236 --> 03:41:16.433
ERICA: This isn't your moment. I'm not giving it
to you. No, not coming over there. I'm not doing

03:41:16.433 --> 03:41:19.810
it. I'm going to transform into a direwolf.

03:41:19.810 --> 03:41:22.995
LAURA and TRAVIS: (exclaiming)

03:41:22.995 --> 03:41:25.096
TRAVIS: Super Saiyan 2!

03:41:25.096 --> 03:41:28.661
SAM: You're already a wolf wolf, you can't be a
double wolf. Oh my god!

03:41:28.661 --> 03:41:30.999
TRAVIS: (chants the Terminator 2 theme)

03:41:30.999 --> 03:41:32.828
ERICA: I got three wolves!

03:41:32.828 --> 03:41:38.620
SAM: There's another wolf? There's one more wolf
past this?

03:41:38.620 --> 03:41:44.856
LIAM: Aurra keels forward and lands on all fours
and her hands plant and you watch as those hands

03:41:44.856 --> 03:41:53.384
expand and grow and her back lengthens and
broadens and turns into this gigantic ridge. A

03:41:53.384 --> 03:41:59.772
pony to horse sized wolf is standing there.
(growling)

03:41:59.772 --> 03:42:01.162
TRAVIS: Fuck yes!

03:42:01.162 --> 03:42:02.342
LAURA: That's a big wolf.

03:42:02.342 --> 03:42:04.058
TJ: I did not know she could do that.

03:42:04.058 --> 03:42:04.804
ERICA: She can.

03:42:04.804 --> 03:42:06.245
LIAM: That was your bonus action.

03:42:06.245 --> 03:42:08.443
LAURA: Bonus action? So you can still attack like
that?

03:42:08.443 --> 03:42:09.396
LIAM: You can still attack.

03:42:09.396 --> 03:42:11.455
LAURA: Kill her!

03:42:11.455 --> 03:42:16.251
ERICA: But is it two separate actions for me to
run at the Iron Woe--?

03:42:16.251 --> 03:42:18.407
LIAM: You have movement and an action.

03:42:18.407 --> 03:42:27.191
ERICA: Okay, so I want to run at the Iron Woe--
Can I physically connect with the Iron Woe? Could

03:42:27.191 --> 03:42:30.528
I attempt to knock the Iron Woe over?

03:42:30.528 --> 03:42:32.774
LIAM: You can totally get around--

03:42:32.774 --> 03:42:35.446
ERICA: I want to attempt to leap on and pin the
Iron Woe.

03:42:35.446 --> 03:42:36.805
LIAM: Sure.

03:42:36.805 --> 03:42:40.240
ERICA: That's what I want to do as my direwolf.
It's fine.

03:42:40.240 --> 03:42:43.699
LIAM: Yeah, make a strength check.

03:42:43.699 --> 03:42:45.681
ERICA: Yep.

03:42:45.681 --> 03:42:48.455
LIAM: At disadvantage as--

03:42:48.455 --> 03:42:50.348
ERICA: Ahh, 15.

03:42:50.348 --> 03:42:51.766
LAURA: Disadvantage?

03:42:51.766 --> 03:42:53.892
LIAM: Yeah. No opposable thumbs.

03:42:53.892 --> 03:42:55.822
ERICA: Eight. And strength.

03:42:55.822 --> 03:42:57.433
LAURA: But big!

03:42:57.433 --> 03:42:58.409
LIAM: Sure.

03:42:58.409 --> 03:43:00.952
ERICA: Don't tell me. Don't do the things. Where
am I? I'm looking at my things and not getting

03:43:00.952 --> 03:43:03.358
it-- okay. Ten.

03:43:03.358 --> 03:43:14.370
LIAM: Ten. You do run up and your claws drag down
the bones of her back, but she is able to pivot

03:43:14.370 --> 03:43:19.568
and take the momentum of you and shove you off of
her.

03:43:19.568 --> 03:43:21.911
SAM: Just kill her, Aurra!

03:43:21.911 --> 03:43:28.193
LIAM: You don't have a lot of flexibility and
mobility-- you're not a ninja in this shape. You

03:43:28.193 --> 03:43:32.661
are a powerhouse. We'll say that's the end of your
turn.

03:43:32.661 --> 03:43:34.744
SAM: No, it's not. She's Hasted.

03:43:34.744 --> 03:43:35.945
LIAM: Oh, she's Hasted!

03:43:35.945 --> 03:43:38.507
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! Direwolf Hasted!

03:43:38.507 --> 03:43:40.767
LAURA: Ahh! Bite her!

03:43:40.767 --> 03:43:45.360
LIAM: It lasts for a minute, so ten rounds. You
have another action.

03:43:45.360 --> 03:43:46.960
ERICA: Ten rounds?

03:43:46.960 --> 03:43:48.117
LIAM: So you can bite.

03:43:48.117 --> 03:43:49.778
LAURA: Bite her!

03:43:49.778 --> 03:43:52.900
LIAM: You can no longer cast spells though, not in
this shape.

03:43:52.900 --> 03:43:58.560
ERICA: Yeah, can I-- I'm going to bite her neck.

03:43:58.560 --> 03:44:04.166
LIAM: Okay, go for it. Roll an attack. That's plus
five to whatever you roll.

03:44:04.166 --> 03:44:05.102
LAURA: Ugh.

03:44:05.102 --> 03:44:07.048
LIAM: Because it's direwolf

03:44:07.048 --> 03:44:08.730
ERICA: God, okay, that's nine.

03:44:08.730 --> 03:44:13.252
LIAM: You leap and try to snap at her face and she
is so tall. She rears back a bit and you (biting

03:44:13.252 --> 03:44:17.975
noise) and fall down (growling) and hold your
ground.

03:44:17.975 --> 03:44:20.006
LAURA: I like that we're surrounding her though.

03:44:20.006 --> 03:44:21.273
LIAM: Yes, yes.

03:44:21.273 --> 03:44:23.193
SAM: (mimicking Liam) Yes, yes.

03:44:23.193 --> 03:44:29.127
TJ: I would like to back up because she is
terrifying, and so is she.

03:44:29.127 --> 03:44:31.289
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, lot of shit going on in that
area.

03:44:31.289 --> 03:44:39.843
TJ: I am sorry, grandmother, but this may hurt.

03:44:39.843 --> 03:44:42.549
SAM: (imitating Lucius) Let us pray.

03:44:42.549 --> 03:44:44.984
ERICA: This is great.

03:44:44.984 --> 03:44:46.898
TJ: Moonbeam.

03:44:46.898 --> 03:44:51.661
LIAM: Okay, Moonbeam is a tricky thing. It's my
son's favorite spell and there's a lot of debate

03:44:51.961 --> 03:44:58.828
on how-- but you have been doing this for 30
years. When I first started navigating Moonbeam, I

03:44:58.828 --> 03:45:04.092
thought that when you cast it, the damage happened
immediately. But I've seen a lot of debate about

03:45:04.092 --> 03:45:09.989
this and what, generally, people say is that it's
when the Moonbeam moves onto you, or at the start

03:45:09.989 --> 03:45:18.710
of your turn, but not when you throw it on
somebody else. Meaning you would dump the Moonbeam

03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:25.475
on Grandma, and then as soon as her turn started
that's when the damage would take effect.

03:45:25.475 --> 03:45:31.463
TJ: I don't know why that would matter one way or
another. For simplicity in book-keeping?

03:45:31.463 --> 03:45:33.144
LIAM: Let's just do it now.

03:45:33.144 --> 03:45:34.385
TJ: It's just easier.

03:45:34.385 --> 03:45:37.882
LIAM: Because her turn is so far away. Let's just
nuke her.

03:45:37.882 --> 03:45:38.653
TJ: Okay.

03:45:38.653 --> 03:45:51.491
LIAM: She has to make a save. It is--

03:45:51.491 --> 03:45:53.812
TJ: Versus 15, save con.

03:45:53.812 --> 03:45:55.853
LIAM: Constitution.

03:45:55.853 --> 03:45:58.467
TJ: She doesn't look too healthy.

03:45:58.467 --> 03:45:59.876
LIAM: She makes it.

03:45:59.876 --> 03:46:00.847
TJ: Of course she does.

03:46:00.847 --> 03:46:08.242
LIAM: Rolled a 19. She takes half. The damage is?

03:46:08.242 --> 03:46:11.303
TJ: 2d10.

03:46:11.303 --> 03:46:15.098
LIAM: Okay. I got papers everywhere.

03:46:15.098 --> 03:46:22.432
TJ: 14 points of damage. Full.

03:46:22.432 --> 03:46:23.539
LIAM: Okay.

03:46:23.539 --> 03:46:30.945
TJ: So half of that. I don't know if this matters.
There's extra information. First off, she's hit by

03:46:30.945 --> 03:46:37.985
the Mark of Waning because this is radiant damage.
So her speed is halved and she has disadvantage on

03:46:37.985 --> 03:46:39.581
strength ability checks.

03:46:39.581 --> 03:46:41.349
LIAM: Cool.

03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:47.673
TJ: Also, a shapechanger makes a saving throw with
disadvantage. Is she a shapechanger?

03:46:47.673 --> 03:46:51.534
LIAM: I would say she's not anymore.

03:46:51.534 --> 03:46:52.647
TJ: Okay.

03:46:52.647 --> 03:46:54.689
LAURA: Because she's stuck in that form.

03:46:54.689 --> 03:46:56.149
LIAM: That's it, yeah.

03:46:56.149 --> 03:46:58.500
SAM: (whispering) TJ's notes are color coded!

03:46:58.500 --> 03:47:04.427
TRAVIS: The fucking doctor is in over here. This
is some amazing shit.

03:47:04.980 --> 03:47:06.984
LAURA: He's schooling us.

03:47:07.284 --> 03:47:09.473
LIAM: All right. Is that the end of your turn?

03:47:09.473 --> 03:47:13.543
TJ: It is. I moved, yes, and I pressed myself
against the wall.

03:47:13.543 --> 03:47:18.465
LIAM: The Iron Woe is going to use a different
Legendary Action.

03:47:18.465 --> 03:47:20.171
LAURA: (groans)

03:47:20.917 --> 03:47:28.189
LIAM: She curls her shoulders forward and that
black inky substance, whatever it was, starts to

03:47:28.189 --> 03:47:37.279
expand out from around her and envelop you all. I
need all of you to make a Wisdom save.

03:47:37.868 --> 03:47:42.477
LAURA: Oh no. Where's your Wisdom at? Where's your
Wisdom at, sister?

03:47:43.484 --> 03:47:45.199
ERICA: Which one was a save?

03:47:45.199 --> 03:47:46.774
SAM: These are saving throws up here.

03:47:46.774 --> 03:47:47.654
ERICA: I see.

03:47:47.654 --> 03:47:48.821
SAM: Oh, you have got a really good Wisdom.

03:47:48.821 --> 03:47:49.888
ERICA: Yeah, I've got good Wisdom.

03:47:49.888 --> 03:47:50.754
TRAVIS: Four.

03:47:50.754 --> 03:47:51.956
LIAM: So--

03:47:51.956 --> 03:47:53.796
TRAVIS: I'm over there.

03:47:53.796 --> 03:47:57.152
LIAM: Yeah, all of you. Four.

03:47:57.152 --> 03:47:58.434
SAM: Natural 20.

03:47:58.434 --> 03:48:00.152
LIAM: Natural 20! Okay.

03:48:00.152 --> 03:48:01.379
ERICA: 12.

03:48:01.379 --> 03:48:04.133
LAURA: 15.

03:48:04.133 --> 03:48:20.288
LIAM: All right. Lawrence, Aurra, you feel sick to
your stomach. You feel anger and pain and sorrow

03:48:20.288 --> 03:48:30.251
radiating off the expired body of your
grandmother. You feel loss. You feel confusion.

03:48:30.251 --> 03:48:41.674
You have to get out of here. You have to get away
from her. Now. You two are frightened.

03:48:43.856 --> 03:48:48.565
TJ: Can I use my reaction to give them a second.
It's a moon thing.

03:48:48.565 --> 03:48:50.042
LIAM: What's the reaction?

03:48:50.042 --> 03:48:55.196
TJ: Luminous Clarity. I can shine a light into the
darkest moments, shielding it from alien

03:48:55.196 --> 03:49:00.062
influence. When a creature within 30 feet that I
can see makes a wisdom saving throw, you can use

03:49:00.062 --> 03:49:02.460
your reaction to grant them advantage on the
roll.

03:49:02.460 --> 03:49:03.730
LIAM: You can.

03:49:03.730 --> 03:49:05.491
TRAVIS: Whoa!

03:49:05.491 --> 03:49:07.893
SAM: Just one? Is it one creature?

03:49:07.893 --> 03:49:09.290
LIAM: It's one creature.

03:49:09.290 --> 03:49:11.924
TJ: One right now, yeah. But I can do it again if
you don't run too far.

03:49:11.924 --> 03:49:14.673
TRAVIS: Which one? Which creature?

03:49:14.673 --> 03:49:18.525
LIAM: It's in reaction-- You get one reaction a
round and this is the reaction, so you pick one

03:49:18.525 --> 03:49:19.765
person.

03:49:19.765 --> 03:49:22.479
TJ: Who's reacting? Who do I see who needs it?

03:49:22.479 --> 03:49:24.651
LIAM: Aurra and Lawrence.

03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:27.442
TJ: Aurra.

03:49:27.442 --> 03:49:29.849
(laughter)

03:49:29.849 --> 03:49:32.371
LIAM: So roll again.

03:49:32.431 --> 03:49:33.788
ERICA: What am I rolling for?

03:49:33.788 --> 03:49:35.186
LIAM: Just roll that d20.

03:49:35.186 --> 03:49:36.421
SAM: You get another chance.

03:49:36.421 --> 03:49:37.757
LAURA: Ooh, yes! You did it!

03:49:37.757 --> 03:49:41.015
SAM: It's a way better one. Plus wisdom save--

03:49:41.015 --> 03:49:42.454
ERICA: Okay.

03:49:42.454 --> 03:49:43.725
TJ: Just don't run too far.

03:49:43.725 --> 03:49:45.179
TRAVIS: I'm just running like a bitch.

03:49:45.179 --> 03:49:47.412
ERICA: 24.

03:49:47.412 --> 03:49:55.713
LIAM: All right. That terror does overwhelm you,
and the second before you turn to scrabble away,

03:49:55.713 --> 03:50:10.998
you hear a young feminine voice in your ear say:
"Stand." The fear abates, and you breathe, a giant

03:50:10.998 --> 03:50:23.301
beast of a wolf, and snarl at your grandmother.
Not so for Lawrence. Also-- never mind. Portia, I

03:50:23.301 --> 03:50:28.425
need you to make a check to see if you control
yourself right now.

03:50:28.425 --> 03:50:29.446
LAURA: Okay.

03:50:29.446 --> 03:50:34.918
LIAM: You need to roll-- Since we can't remember,
neither you nor I--

03:50:34.918 --> 03:50:37.155
SAM: It's ten.

03:50:37.155 --> 03:50:40.972
LIAM: It's ten or half, you're right. So ten.

03:50:40.972 --> 03:50:44.642
LAURA: I roll a d20 and get higher than a ten.

03:50:44.642 --> 03:50:46.271
LIAM: Ten, yeah.

03:50:46.271 --> 03:50:53.524
LAURA: Oh god. Oh no. Ten!

03:50:53.524 --> 03:50:55.990
TRAVIS: That's it! Or higher?

03:50:55.990 --> 03:51:01.075
LIAM: Hold on-- you have to hit ten.

03:51:01.075 --> 03:51:05.197
LAURA: Phew!

03:51:05.197 --> 03:51:10.504
LIAM: It's a wisdom save, so if you have any
wisdom bonus that'll get you over the hump, too.

03:51:10.504 --> 03:51:11.603
LAURA: Oh, well, yeah.

03:51:11.603 --> 03:51:18.298
LIAM: So you're fine. You're in control. You feel,
from the pain you took, your blood is boiling, and

03:51:18.298 --> 03:51:22.870
you want to fuck something up but you realize what
it is you have to fuck up. What do you want to do?

03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:24.494
LAURA: Fuck up that Iron Woe.

03:51:24.494 --> 03:51:32.001
LIAM: Oh, the Iron Woe. It's your turn.

03:51:32.001 --> 03:51:34.948
LAURA: Oh! Well then, I'm going to do that.

03:51:34.948 --> 03:51:36.319
LIAM: Go for it.

03:51:36.319 --> 03:51:37.717
TRAVIS: Come on, come on!

03:51:37.717 --> 03:51:42.512
LAURA: I've got to see what my other bonus action
could be. Fuck it, I'm just going to do it.

03:51:42.512 --> 03:51:44.207
TRAVIS: Attack her.

03:51:44.207 --> 03:51:45.987
LAURA: (growls) I'm going to attack her!

03:51:45.987 --> 03:51:49.026
TRAVIS: You could also do any of your curses?

03:51:49.026 --> 03:52:01.198
LAURA: I know, but-- I've looked and one is a
reaction. I just need to remember it. 11 on the

03:52:01.198 --> 03:52:07.362
first-- oh wait, I should probably roll to see if
it hits. I'm dumb. Natural 20!

03:52:07.362 --> 03:52:09.437
(cheering)

03:52:09.437 --> 03:52:17.046
LAURA: Do I roll my dice again or use what I just
rolled? Six plus doubled, that's 12 plus five is

03:52:17.046 --> 03:52:18.428
17 on the first hit.

03:52:18.428 --> 03:52:19.665
SAM: Oof.

03:52:19.665 --> 03:52:30.436
LAURA: 18 natural-- wait, natural 16 on the second
one, so that hits again. Ten plus five, 15 on the

03:52:30.436 --> 03:52:32.273
second hit. Third swipe--

03:52:32.273 --> 03:52:34.186
LIAM: A 17, 15--

03:52:34.186 --> 03:52:42.276
LAURA: Then 13 plus six, 19, that hits again.

03:52:42.276 --> 03:52:43.970
LIAM: Yep.

03:52:43.970 --> 03:52:47.365
SAM: These are all with your claws?

03:52:47.365 --> 03:52:48.807
LAURA: That's eight. These are my claws!

03:52:48.807 --> 03:52:50.147
ERICA: Yes!

03:52:50.147 --> 03:52:53.896
SAM: How do you do 40 points of damage with--
Jeez.

03:52:53.896 --> 03:52:55.142
TRAVIS: Crit on that first one.

03:52:55.142 --> 03:52:59.120
LAURA: Oh no, I didn't do-- that last one was to
see if it hits, this last one is only eight points

03:52:59.120 --> 03:53:00.165
of damage.

03:53:00.165 --> 03:53:01.192
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:53:01.192 --> 03:53:02.273
TRAVIS: 40 points total.

03:53:02.273 --> 03:53:03.093
LAURA: Crazy.

03:53:03.093 --> 03:53:07.114
LIAM: Is it 40 points total? I lost track of that.
It was 17, 15--

03:53:07.114 --> 03:53:08.215
LAURA: And eight.

03:53:08.215 --> 03:53:12.325
SAM: How do you get 15 from 1d6 plus five?

03:53:12.325 --> 03:53:15.880
LAURA: It's 1d6 plus the Rite of--

03:53:15.880 --> 03:53:22.093
LIAM: Plus strength, plus the Rite. Yeah.

03:53:22.093 --> 03:53:24.954
SAM: Oh shit! That's beastly.

03:53:24.954 --> 03:53:26.465
LAURA: Wait, plus strength?

03:53:26.465 --> 03:53:31.115
LIAM: The plus five to your attack. You're good.

03:53:31.115 --> 03:53:32.164
LAURA: Okay.

03:53:32.164 --> 03:53:33.343
TRAVIS: That's your modifier.

03:53:33.343 --> 03:53:36.514
LIAM: Okay. Do you want to move anywhere?

03:53:36.514 --> 03:53:45.583
LAURA: She'll get a swipe at me, but-- Yeah, okay,
I'm going to back up. No. Fuck it. I'm going to

03:53:45.583 --> 03:53:46.908
stand there. Fuck it.

03:53:46.908 --> 03:53:48.095
LIAM: Okay.

03:53:48.095 --> 03:53:49.148
SAM: Fuck it!

03:53:49.148 --> 03:53:50.718
TRAVIS: P-H-U-C-K.

03:53:50.718 --> 03:53:52.648
LIAM: Benicio, you're up.

03:53:52.648 --> 03:54:00.595
SAM: I will roll. I rolled an 11 to maintain my
calm demeanor.

03:54:00.595 --> 03:54:01.862
LIAM: Okay.

03:54:01.862 --> 03:54:07.002
SAM: Now I will attack. Glaive out. Natural 20!

03:54:07.002 --> 03:54:09.177
(cheering)

03:54:09.177 --> 03:54:15.729
SAM: That's-- hold on. What do I double?

03:54:15.729 --> 03:54:19.396
LIAM: Just the dice. Not the modifier.

03:54:19.396 --> 03:54:22.237
LAURA: But all the dice.

03:54:22.237 --> 03:54:23.764
LIAM: Yeah, all the dice.

03:54:23.764 --> 03:54:32.720
SAM: Whoa, okay. That's a nine, so that's 18 plus
three is 21.

03:54:32.720 --> 03:54:33.955
LAURA: Plus ten.

03:54:33.955 --> 03:54:35.729
SAM: Plus ten?

03:54:35.729 --> 03:54:37.068
LAURA: You double that too.

03:54:37.068 --> 03:54:38.346
SAM: I double this too?

03:54:38.346 --> 03:54:39.818
LIAM: Any die you roll, you double.

03:54:39.818 --> 03:54:46.621
SAM: Whoa. Okay. 31 points of damage for the first
attack. A lot of that is slashing and stuff

03:54:46.621 --> 03:54:52.646
though. I don't know if that affects anything.
Attack number two! Oh god. Nope, 18.

03:54:52.646 --> 03:54:54.264
LIAM: Does not hit.

03:54:54.264 --> 03:54:56.034
TRAVIS: Is your slashing magical?

03:54:56.034 --> 03:54:58.118
SAM: No?

03:54:58.118 --> 03:55:00.173
TRAVIS: Is it your glaive or your claws?

03:55:00.173 --> 03:55:04.469
SAM: Oh, well, it's imbued with the Rite of the
Flame. I don't know.

03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:05.996
TRAVIS: Yeah, so it's a magic weapon.

03:55:05.996 --> 03:55:08.561
TJ: Who is she facing?

03:55:08.561 --> 03:55:11.890
TRAVIS: Me. You fucking dick.

03:55:11.890 --> 03:55:14.813
TJ: Does the position give them any advantage to
hit?

03:55:14.813 --> 03:55:17.370
LAURA: Oh, that's right, we're all flanking her.

03:55:17.370 --> 03:55:20.400
LIAM: Only one person is flanking, and that is
Benicio.

03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:22.041
SAM: So what does that mean?

03:55:22.041 --> 03:55:24.777
LIAM: Advantage on your hits, but you hit already.
So anything you miss, roll a second time.

03:55:24.777 --> 03:55:28.800
SAM: I just missed. I will roll a second time.
That is a 25 to hit.

03:55:28.800 --> 03:55:32.131
LIAM: That hits. The beast is going feral.

03:55:32.131 --> 03:55:43.084
SAM: Nine points of damage. And a bonus action to
attack with the back of the glaive. That's an 18.

03:55:43.084 --> 03:55:44.343
TRAVIS: Advantage!

03:55:44.343 --> 03:55:46.445
SAM: Oh! That's less.

03:55:46.445 --> 03:55:48.626
(laughter)

03:55:48.626 --> 03:55:52.098
LIAM: All right. Lawrence, it is on you.

03:55:52.098 --> 03:55:57.089
TRAVIS: Well, I'm a scared little bitch right now,
and I have to roll a wisdom saving throw to see if

03:55:57.089 --> 03:55:58.247
I even hold--

03:55:58.247 --> 03:55:59.539
LIAM: Right.

03:55:59.539 --> 03:56:03.563
TRAVIS: I took 12 points of damage, so I have to
roll-- no, ten.

03:56:03.563 --> 03:56:06.285
LIAM: Ten. With whatever wisdom modifier you
have.

03:56:06.285 --> 03:56:07.375
TRAVIS: 17. I'm okay.

03:56:07.375 --> 03:56:09.882
LIAM: You're good. Okay. You can go no closer.

03:56:09.882 --> 03:56:11.534
TRAVIS: What's that?

03:56:11.534 --> 03:56:13.497
LIAM: You can go no closer than you are.

03:56:13.497 --> 03:56:16.887
TRAVIS: Oh, but I don't have to turn tail and run
the fuck away?

03:56:16.887 --> 03:56:20.312
LIAM: A frightened creature has disadvantage on
ability checks and attack rolls while the source

03:56:20.312 --> 03:56:23.895
of its fear is within line of sight. The creature
can't willingly move closer to the source of its

03:56:23.895 --> 03:56:26.662
fear. You can technically--

03:56:26.662 --> 03:56:27.818
TRAVIS: Am I still in melee?

03:56:27.818 --> 03:56:28.722
LIAM: Yeah.

03:56:28.722 --> 03:56:30.795
TRAVIS: Awesome. I'll take all three attacks at
disadvantage at her.

03:56:30.795 --> 03:56:35.469
LAURA: But you have advantage because you're
flanking. So it's balanced.

03:56:35.469 --> 03:56:37.761
LIAM: Straight roll.

03:56:37.761 --> 03:56:43.072
TRAVIS: Okay. 13 plus six is 19?

03:56:43.072 --> 03:56:44.018
LIAM: Hits.

03:56:44.018 --> 03:56:44.936
TRAVIS: Nice.

03:56:44.936 --> 03:56:45.894
SAM: Whoa.

03:56:45.894 --> 03:56:47.845
TRAVIS: Second one, ten plus six-- 16.

03:56:47.845 --> 03:56:50.955
LIAM: Harrowed, frenzied wolf, desperate to live.

03:56:50.955 --> 03:56:57.275
TRAVIS: Eight and six, that's 14, so only one of
those hits. That is-- four plus four is eight.

03:56:57.275 --> 03:57:00.734
One. Nine points of lighting damage.

03:57:00.734 --> 03:57:13.024
LIAM: Her chest crackles for a moment and then
goes still. Okay.

03:57:13.024 --> 03:57:17.728
LAURA: You get to roll to see if you stay
frightened at the top of a turn, or does it keep

03:57:17.728 --> 03:57:19.125
frightened?

03:57:19.125 --> 03:57:23.996
LIAM: Yes, if a target's saving throw-- The
frightened target can repeat the saving throw at

03:57:23.996 --> 03:57:26.983
the end of each of its turns. So make a roll.

03:57:26.983 --> 03:57:27.941
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:57:27.941 --> 03:57:29.379
LIAM: It's wisdom.

03:57:29.379 --> 03:57:30.450
TRAVIS: 12.

03:57:30.450 --> 03:57:32.282
LIAM: Do not make it.

03:57:32.282 --> 03:57:35.429
TJ: Question, do I have a reaction yet? Is this a
new round?

03:57:35.429 --> 03:57:37.680
LIAM: Yes, it is.

03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:39.995
TJ: May I give him that opportunity?

03:57:39.995 --> 03:57:42.927
LIAM: Yes, you may, as Liam rubbed his eye.

03:57:42.927 --> 03:57:47.036
TRAVIS: Advantage? Great. Even worse.

03:57:47.036 --> 03:57:53.616
LIAM: Her harrowing presence is simply too great.

03:57:53.616 --> 03:57:57.116
LAURA: She's very scary.

03:57:57.116 --> 03:57:59.531
LIAM: It is the dark elf's turn.

03:57:59.531 --> 03:58:06.546
SAM: Wait, Dad said to stop.

03:58:06.546 --> 03:58:09.656
TRAVIS: Nobody heard that except you.

03:58:09.656 --> 03:58:11.242
ERICA: This was before the Iron Woe came.

03:58:11.242 --> 03:58:12.436
SAM: That's true.

03:58:12.436 --> 03:58:15.562
ERICA: That was when you were choking him to
death.

03:58:15.562 --> 03:58:19.788
SAM: I didn't choke him to death. I ripped out his
throat.

03:58:19.788 --> 03:58:21.063
ERICA: Perfect.

03:58:21.063 --> 03:58:22.153
SAM: But to save him!

03:58:22.153 --> 03:58:23.212
ERICA: Same same.

03:58:23.212 --> 03:58:27.423
SAM: Sometimes we have to set free those we love.

03:58:27.423 --> 03:58:29.430
LIAM: Your AC is what, Benicio?

03:58:29.430 --> 03:58:31.072
SAM: 17.

03:58:31.072 --> 03:58:41.593
LIAM: Okay. You take five points of piercing
damage as a spear floating in the air shoves into

03:58:41.593 --> 03:58:42.841
your back.

03:58:42.841 --> 03:58:49.704
SAM: (growls) It's like when I joined the
fraternity.

03:58:49.704 --> 03:58:53.899
(laughter)

03:58:53.899 --> 03:58:57.093
LIAM: That is the end of your turn and now it is
the Iron Woe's turn.

03:58:57.093 --> 03:58:58.838
LAURA: Ahh, the Iron Woe.

03:58:58.838 --> 03:59:00.972
ERICA: Here she comes.

03:59:00.972 --> 03:59:11.574
LIAM: She turns this way, is feeling very penned
in, and goes to town on Portia.

03:59:11.574 --> 03:59:13.085
LAURA: Why Portia?

03:59:13.085 --> 03:59:14.946
ERICA: Because always Portia.

03:59:14.946 --> 03:59:17.604
TRAVIS: Does she leave my range? Do I get an
attack?

03:59:17.604 --> 03:59:25.993
LIAM: No, she just turned. That's a 20 with her
claw.

03:59:25.993 --> 03:59:27.808
LAURA: Yeah, that hits me.

03:59:27.808 --> 03:59:32.456
LIAM: You take 14 points of slashing damage--

03:59:32.456 --> 03:59:33.810
LAURA: Is she magical?

03:59:33.810 --> 03:59:35.414
LIAM: --from Genevieve. Yes, she is.

03:59:35.414 --> 03:59:36.768
SAM: We have established that she is magical.

03:59:36.768 --> 03:59:38.805
LIAM: And then she goes to bite you.

03:59:38.805 --> 03:59:40.054
LAURA: Oh no.

03:59:40.054 --> 03:59:49.220
LIAM: She leans down, the jaws open-- oh, and you
take a half step back, and feel those jaws go

03:59:49.220 --> 03:59:56.033
(crunching sound) right there, right in front of
your nose. She misses and rears back, and her head

03:59:56.033 --> 04:00:09.090
tilts back, and she goes (gurgling roar sound),
and all of you feel a longing and a heartbreak

04:00:09.090 --> 04:00:15.831
that you can't really understand. I have schmutz
in my eyes and my eyes won't stop tearing. Aurra,

04:00:15.831 --> 04:00:17.120
it is your turn.

04:00:17.120 --> 04:00:22.113
SAM: Come on, reindeer. Run over Grandma! Get
her!

04:00:22.113 --> 04:00:25.999
ERICA: She is imperiled right now? The Iron Woe is
imperiled right now?

04:00:26.062 --> 04:00:27.113
LIAM: She's surrounded.

04:00:27.113 --> 04:00:28.012
ERICA: She's surrounded.

04:00:28.012 --> 04:00:29.374
SAM: Get her!

04:00:29.374 --> 04:00:32.565
LAURA: Is she flanking her?

04:00:32.565 --> 04:00:40.402
LIAM: No. You're hasted and you have two dire wolf
bites, if you want.

04:00:40.402 --> 04:00:46.121
ERICA: Oh, to inflict-- I want to cast Guidance.

04:00:46.121 --> 04:00:47.877
LIAM: You can't as a dire wolf.

04:00:47.877 --> 04:00:55.387
ERICA: Shit. Balls. Great. So I can't do anything
other than attack as a dire wolf?

04:00:55.387 --> 04:00:59.580
LIAM: You can bite her. You've got a little extra
padding of druid hit points because you're in this

04:00:59.580 --> 04:01:01.774
dire wolf shape, that's the positive.

04:01:01.774 --> 04:01:03.242
ERICA: Could I transform at this point?

04:01:03.242 --> 04:01:07.614
LIAM: You could, yeah. You could go back to
werewolf form, you could go to your--

04:01:07.614 --> 04:01:09.211
ERICA: I'm going to go back to werewolf form.

04:01:09.211 --> 04:01:12.963
LIAM: Okay. That's your bonus action, so you have
action and hasted action.

04:01:12.963 --> 04:01:14.606
SAM: So now you can cast a spell.

04:01:14.606 --> 04:01:16.900
ERICA: Okay. Guidance.

04:01:16.900 --> 04:01:20.986
LIAM: The dire wolf shrinks up into-- okay, so you
use Guidance to cast on yourself.

04:01:20.986 --> 04:01:22.919
ERICA: Yep. Perception.

04:01:22.919 --> 04:01:27.659
LIAM: Sure. What are you trying to perceive?

04:01:27.659 --> 04:01:34.973
ERICA: I mean, we felt her pain, we felt her
torture, and I want to know what that means.

04:01:34.973 --> 04:01:51.031
LIAM: Make a straight perception check with your
Guidance.

04:01:51.031 --> 04:01:54.985
LAURA: Plus a d4, so this one.

04:01:54.985 --> 04:02:01.002
ERICA: Oh, okay, thank you. That's a seven plus
nine perception.

04:02:01.002 --> 04:02:03.693
LAURA: 16.

04:02:03.693 --> 04:02:06.936
ERICA: 16, thank you, I have to use my fingers,
I'm admitting to it now. 16, great.

04:02:06.936 --> 04:02:16.991
LIAM: The pain that you feel echoing-- all of you
feel echoing in your minds-- is wild. Not

04:02:16.991 --> 04:02:33.919
intelligent. It's a wounded animal. It's too hard
to make out, it's beyond your ken. You still have

04:02:33.919 --> 04:02:37.412
a hasted action. Oh wait, Guidance was its own
spell.

04:02:37.412 --> 04:02:40.744
ERICA: Right. But am I in the midst of Haste
still?

04:02:40.744 --> 04:02:42.986
LIAM: No, but I'm going to give you one more
action.

04:02:42.986 --> 04:02:51.575
ERICA: I'm right next to her, so I don't really
need to-- Can I claw her then?

04:02:51.575 --> 04:02:54.529
LIAM: Yeah. You can bite as a werewolf.

04:02:54.529 --> 04:02:55.492
ERICA: I can bite.

04:02:55.492 --> 04:02:56.482
LIAM: No, you're a werewolf now.

04:02:56.482 --> 04:02:57.335
ERICA: I'm a werewolf now.

04:02:57.335 --> 04:02:59.947
LIAM: So you can claw. Yeah, you've got one claw.

04:02:59.947 --> 04:03:02.676
ERICA: I got one. Or bite? Can I bite?

04:03:02.676 --> 04:03:04.498
SAM and LIAM: It's just claw.

04:03:04.498 --> 04:03:05.887
ERICA: Damn it.

04:03:05.887 --> 04:03:07.403
LIAM: So many wolf forms.

04:03:07.403 --> 04:03:13.097
TRAVIS: (singing) You take the good, you take the
bad, you take them both and there you have the

04:03:13.097 --> 04:03:14.237
form of wolf!

04:03:14.237 --> 04:03:16.874
ERICA: I can claw her one time?

04:03:16.874 --> 04:03:17.874
LIAM: Yes.

04:03:17.874 --> 04:03:18.918
LAURA: Do it!

04:03:18.918 --> 04:03:19.967
SAM: Fuck her up!

04:03:19.967 --> 04:03:20.695
LAURA: Claw her!

04:03:20.695 --> 04:03:23.748
LIAM: You just tried to learn the secret of her
essence. Now you're going to take a swipe.

04:03:23.748 --> 04:03:26.042
ERICA: I claw her from the top of her neck down
her torso.

04:03:26.042 --> 04:03:27.297
LIAM: Roll that d20.

04:03:27.297 --> 04:03:31.029
SAM: Come on, roll big, roll good. Roll nice.
Terrible.

04:03:31.029 --> 04:03:32.946
ERICA: It's a--

04:03:32.946 --> 04:03:34.738
TRAVIS: Yes! Welcome to the table!

04:03:34.738 --> 04:03:42.245
LIAM: That loss has traveled over to you, and
every sibling in this room feels lost. All of you

04:03:42.245 --> 04:03:46.942
know that something is very wrong here and just on
the edge of your comprehension, but you haven't

04:03:46.942 --> 04:03:51.902
grasped it yet. Now it is Lucius' turn.

04:03:51.902 --> 04:03:54.042
SAM: Lucius.

04:03:54.042 --> 04:03:55.690
TRAVIS: How are we going to find that bastard?

04:03:55.690 --> 04:04:04.331
TJ: I will say a prayer.

04:04:04.331 --> 04:04:06.603
ERICA: Really?

04:04:06.603 --> 04:04:16.268
TJ: Moonweaver. Strike down our enemies. Show us
your sacred weapon. Spiritual Weapon.

04:04:16.268 --> 04:04:17.874
LIAM: Excellent.

04:04:17.874 --> 04:04:31.668
TJ: It is-- shall I make a melee attack?

04:04:31.668 --> 04:04:33.497
LIAM: Yes, you may.

04:04:33.497 --> 04:04:39.115
TJ: It is a silver scimitar that very much
represents the crescent moon.

04:04:39.115 --> 04:04:45.830
ERICA: Yes, that is the moon.

04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:50.412
LAURA: You chose your weapon correctly.

04:04:50.412 --> 04:04:54.257
TJ: 18.

04:04:54.257 --> 04:05:00.865
LIAM: It's against her? It does not hit, it just
misses.

04:05:00.865 --> 04:05:09.706
TJ: I continue with the Moonbeam raining down on
her. Does she save again?

04:05:09.706 --> 04:05:12.191
LIAM: Oh right.

04:05:12.191 --> 04:05:14.107
TRAVIS: Yeah, she's supposed to get--

04:05:14.107 --> 04:05:18.079
LIAM: Yeah, Moonbeam is tricky. She does not make
the save.

04:05:18.079 --> 04:05:19.247
LAURA: Yes!

04:05:19.247 --> 04:05:24.293
TJ: Ten points of damage.

04:05:24.293 --> 04:05:25.386
LIAM: Okay.

04:05:25.386 --> 04:05:29.409
TJ: And she has the Mark of Waning on her.

04:05:29.409 --> 04:05:30.730
LIAM: And remind me.

04:05:30.730 --> 04:05:35.023
TJ: Creature's speed is halved, and has
disadvantage on strength ability checks.

04:05:35.023 --> 04:05:36.902
LIAM: Okay, got it.

04:05:36.902 --> 04:05:40.278
TRAVIS: She hasn't really gone anywhere, she's
just kicking ass.

04:05:40.278 --> 04:05:44.747
LIAM: Top of the round, she's going to use one of
her legendary actions--

04:05:44.747 --> 04:05:46.006
SAM: Yes?

04:05:46.006 --> 04:05:53.091
LIAM: To move without provoking any opportunity, a
jet almost like a squid releasing ink-- You guys

04:05:53.091 --> 04:06:01.514
are enveloped in a cloud of sorrow. You hear the
bones scraping against each other. She glides away

04:06:01.514 --> 04:06:08.586
faster than you would have imagined, but doesn't
go far. And she comes right back to here.

04:06:08.586 --> 04:06:09.167
LAURA: Do we get--

04:06:09.167 --> 04:06:12.588
LIAM: No attack of opportunity on that legendary
action.

04:06:12.588 --> 04:06:14.942
TRAVIS: That's sorrow's bitch is legend.

04:06:14.942 --> 04:06:19.577
ERICA: It's fine. Just annoyed.

04:06:19.577 --> 04:06:24.045
LIAM: It's Portia's turn.

04:06:24.045 --> 04:06:28.429
SAM: Come on, girl!

04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:29.762
ERICA: Get it!

04:06:29.762 --> 04:06:30.903
LAURA (exaggerated) Shit!

04:06:30.903 --> 04:06:32.860
(laughter)

04:06:32.860 --> 04:06:36.806
SAM: (exaggerated) Shit!

04:06:36.806 --> 04:06:40.740
ERICA: There it is. That's the beat.

04:06:40.740 --> 04:06:43.611
LAURA: I'm going to run over and--

04:06:43.611 --> 04:06:46.402
LIAM: (sweetly) I'm going to strike with my claws
now.

04:06:46.402 --> 04:06:47.847
ERICA: It's a nice transition.

04:06:47.847 --> 04:06:49.104
TRAVIS: (exaggerated) Shit!

04:06:49.104 --> 04:06:53.681
LAURA: I'm going to run over to the Iron Woe and
hit her a couple times.

04:06:53.681 --> 04:06:55.348
LIAM: Coming back at it? Claw, claw, claw?

04:06:55.348 --> 04:06:56.991
LAURA: Yes, claw, claw, claw.

04:06:56.991 --> 04:06:58.152
LIAM: Got it.

04:06:58.152 --> 04:07:07.739
LAURA: See if it hits. That first one doesn't hit.
That second one does hit. Third-- oh wait, I

04:07:07.739 --> 04:07:14.661
wanted to go around to the back of her. So I could
flank her. Can I flank her?

04:07:14.661 --> 04:07:19.357
LIAM: (counting)

04:07:19.357 --> 04:07:20.484
TRAVIS: Stalagmite.

04:07:20.484 --> 04:07:25.087
LIAM: Yes, you've got a stalactite up your butt.

04:07:25.087 --> 04:07:26.367
ERICA: Stalagmites!

04:07:26.367 --> 04:07:28.125
LIAM: Yes, absolutely.

04:07:28.125 --> 04:07:31.408
LAURA: So those first two rolls, do I just say the
first one hit, and then I'll roll again.

04:07:31.408 --> 04:07:32.899
LIAM: What did you roll on the one you hit?

04:07:32.899 --> 04:07:35.199
LAURA: I rolled a 19, natural 19 on that.

04:07:35.199 --> 04:07:36.545
LIAM: Okay, great.

04:07:36.545 --> 04:07:37.555
LAURA: Next hit.

04:07:37.555 --> 04:07:38.432
LIAM: This is the third?

04:07:38.432 --> 04:07:39.432
LAURA: No, this is the second attack.

04:07:39.432 --> 04:07:40.516
LIAM: I thought one missed.

04:07:40.516 --> 04:07:41.595
LAURA: No, because I got advantage, remember?

04:07:41.595 --> 04:07:42.725
LIAM: Why do you have advantage?

04:07:42.725 --> 04:07:43.521
LAURA: Because I'm flanking.

04:07:43.521 --> 04:07:44.583
LIAM: Because you're flanking now, thank you.

04:07:44.583 --> 04:07:45.487
ERICA: That's what she says.

04:07:45.487 --> 04:07:46.664
LAURA: Natural 20 on the second one!

04:07:46.664 --> 04:07:50.344
LIAM: On the second. So hit, 20 hit, and?

04:07:50.344 --> 04:07:58.086
LAURA: I don't think the last one hits. Eight
plus, whatever it is, six. 14.

04:07:58.086 --> 04:08:01.699
LIAM: 14 does not hit, but give me your natural 20
and your regular hit.

04:08:01.699 --> 04:08:10.388
LAURA: Okay, the first one is six plus five is 11.
Then the critical. Oh, that's four.

04:08:10.388 --> 04:08:13.076
SAM: (old lady voice) You never visit me.

04:08:13.076 --> 04:08:14.623
LAURA: Eight plus five.

04:08:14.709 --> 04:08:15.730
ERICA: That's not what she's saying.

04:08:15.730 --> 04:08:16.745
LIAM: Eight plus five, 13.

04:08:16.745 --> 04:08:17.553
LAURA: Yeah.

04:08:17.553 --> 04:08:18.554
LIAM: Okay.

04:08:18.554 --> 04:08:22.924
SAM: (old lady voice) A call every once in 
a while would be nice.

04:08:22.997 --> 04:08:29.472
LIAM: So you rush at her, and you strike out and
we'll say the first hit misses. Then you grab at

04:08:29.472 --> 04:08:30.451
her rib--

04:08:30.451 --> 04:08:32.849
LAURA: I use the stalagmite and I swing around it
and I--

04:08:32.849 --> 04:08:38.885
LIAM: So you come swinging around, almost like
it's a pole, and grab hold of her. You miss on the

04:08:38.885 --> 04:08:46.506
first one, but then right yourself and grab claw,
grab claw on a rib and you rip. Pry a gigantic rib

04:08:46.506 --> 04:08:49.915
away and throw it across the cavern.

04:08:49.915 --> 04:08:53.455
LAURA: (growls)

04:08:53.455 --> 04:08:57.703
TRAVIS: Don't throw it! Beat her to death with
it!

04:08:57.703 --> 04:09:04.277
LIAM: She's going to use a legendary action to
release that cloud of darkness again.

04:09:04.277 --> 04:09:07.967
TJ: She's still half moving, right? Or does
legendary action crush that?

04:09:07.967 --> 04:09:13.428
LIAM: Oh no, it doesn't. You're right. It's half
movement so-- Good, thank you TJ.

04:09:13.428 --> 04:09:18.412
TRAVIS: She's got two legendary actions a turn.

04:09:18.412 --> 04:09:29.587
LIAM: She has three legendary-- She has points,
different things take more out of her. I let you

04:09:29.587 --> 04:09:32.736
see behind the veil a bit. Now we are onto
Benicio.

04:09:32.736 --> 04:09:34.663
SAM: But I'm too far to do anything.

04:09:34.663 --> 04:09:37.093
TRAVIS: She's bad news.

04:09:37.093 --> 04:09:41.602
SAM: She's more than 30 feet away from me, isn't
she?

04:09:41.602 --> 04:09:43.679
TRAVIS: Come on deep, bassy Riegel, get it.

04:09:43.679 --> 04:09:46.823
SAM: (deeper voice) Yeah. Is she more than 30 feet
away from me, Liam?

04:09:46.823 --> 04:09:52.905
TRAVIS: This time tomorrow you'll be high and
sprightly all over again.

04:09:52.905 --> 04:09:55.286
LIAM: (counting) She's just within range.

04:09:55.286 --> 04:09:57.918
SAM: I'm going to run up on grandma.

04:09:57.918 --> 04:09:59.684
LIAM: Leave dad behind.

04:09:59.684 --> 04:10:05.054
SAM: Bye, dad. And I'm going to stab her in the
butt.

04:10:05.054 --> 04:10:06.376
LIAM: Okay.

04:10:06.376 --> 04:10:07.586
ERICA: Butt?

04:10:07.586 --> 04:10:08.734
LIAM: Good flavor.

04:10:08.734 --> 04:10:09.996
SAM: 19?

04:10:09.996 --> 04:10:10.955
LIAM: Hits.

04:10:10.955 --> 04:10:14.868
SAM: Sorry, grandma.

04:10:14.868 --> 04:10:16.913
ERICA: That's weird.

04:10:16.913 --> 04:10:19.684
SAM: 13 points of damage.

04:10:19.684 --> 04:10:20.992
LIAM: How much?

04:10:20.992 --> 04:10:22.392
SAM: 13 points of damage.

04:10:22.392 --> 04:10:23.565
LIAM: Great.

04:10:23.565 --> 04:10:30.433
TRAVIS: No more allowance for you. I sent you a
birthday card with a five dollar bill in it.

04:10:30.433 --> 04:10:32.192
SAM: Your sweaters never fit.

04:10:32.192 --> 04:10:34.079
TRAVIS: I never hear anything.

04:10:34.079 --> 04:10:36.389
SAM: I'll stab her again in the belly.

04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:37.415
LIAM: Go for it.

04:10:37.415 --> 04:10:38.712
ERICA: In the belly, you've moved on.

04:10:38.712 --> 04:10:39.810
SAM: Fail.

04:10:39.810 --> 04:10:40.680
LIAM: Okay.

04:10:40.680 --> 04:10:42.437
SAM: But I'll bonus action hit her in the back.

04:10:42.437 --> 04:10:45.259
LIAM: Do it, jock!

04:10:45.259 --> 04:10:47.076
SAM: That also misses. 14.

04:10:47.076 --> 04:10:49.856
LIAM: Great, just like when you practice nunchucks
in front of your mirror.

04:10:49.856 --> 04:10:57.139
SAM: That's it, and now I'm right on her and she's
going to kill me.

04:10:57.139 --> 04:11:09.795
LIAM: She is, in fact, going to use a legendary
action to swipe at your ass. Here it comes. Oh,

04:11:09.795 --> 04:11:20.913
not that great, actually. Nope, your AC is 17. She
lumbers around and swipes and you had just

04:11:20.913 --> 04:11:26.122
finished doing this little trick with the butt end
of the weapon and held her back for a second as

04:11:26.122 --> 04:11:28.757
she went (woosh). You held her at bay.

04:11:28.757 --> 04:11:31.006
SAM: Lawrence, save me!

04:11:31.006 --> 04:11:32.675
LIAM: And it's Lawrence's turn.

04:11:32.675 --> 04:11:35.390
TRAVIS: But I'm still frightened, right?

04:11:35.390 --> 04:11:36.932
LIAM: You are still frightened.

04:11:36.932 --> 04:11:38.930
TRAVIS: Can I roll to see-- I have to roll at the
very end of it.

04:11:38.930 --> 04:11:40.204
LIAM: It's at the end of your turn.

04:11:40.204 --> 04:11:41.586
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch ass!

04:11:41.586 --> 04:11:42.795
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can't move closer to her.

04:11:42.795 --> 04:11:43.927
TRAVIS: No! I can't!

04:11:43.927 --> 04:11:45.185
LIAM: At the end of each of your turns.

04:11:45.185 --> 04:11:47.113
SAM: Don't you have something you can throw?

04:11:47.113 --> 04:11:49.577
TRAVIS: I can't move closer, right?

04:11:49.577 --> 04:11:51.035
LIAM: Nope, can't go near her.

04:11:51.035 --> 04:11:56.388
TRAVIS: Maybe I should just run in the other
direction with my claws out and see if I hit that

04:11:56.388 --> 04:12:02.019
invisible drow. Fuck it, that's what I'm going to
do! I'm going to run in this direction as fast as

04:12:02.019 --> 04:12:02.308
I can.

04:12:02.308 --> 04:12:04.355
LIAM: You can't go there.

04:12:04.355 --> 04:12:06.046
TRAVIS: I'm running parallel, right?

04:12:06.046 --> 04:12:09.080
LIAM: Yeah, you could run this way, but your
brother's in the way.

04:12:09.080 --> 04:12:16.372
TRAVIS: All right, I'll run towards Aurra. Like
further away, claws out to see if I hit anything.

04:12:16.372 --> 04:12:21.875
LIAM: I'll say you get right here. Aurra steps to
the side slightly. No, no connection. I know where

04:12:21.875 --> 04:12:22.823
he is.

04:12:22.823 --> 04:12:24.229
SAM: Want to keep dashing?

04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:26.542
TJ: Aurra's in a different form right? She's in
the hybrid form.

04:12:26.542 --> 04:12:27.768
ERICA: I'm in the werewolf.

04:12:27.768 --> 04:12:30.922
LIAM: Thank you. Where is that?

04:12:30.922 --> 04:12:34.291
LAURA: It's right next to-- Yeah.

04:12:34.291 --> 04:12:39.366
TRAVIS: I'll use my action to dash over to this
corner, claws out.

04:12:39.366 --> 04:12:40.579
LIAM: That's a great idea.

04:12:40.579 --> 04:12:41.757
TRAVIS: Did I feel anything? (yelling)

04:12:41.757 --> 04:12:48.909
LIAM: Terrified, like-- No connection.

04:12:48.909 --> 04:12:51.761
TRAVIS: Can I roll to break the--

04:12:51.761 --> 04:12:53.782
LIAM: Yes, please do.

04:12:53.782 --> 04:12:57.253
TRAVIS: 18 plus one, 19!

04:12:57.253 --> 04:13:02.229
LIAM: You get around the corner, you get her out
of your vision, plant your hand, your claw against

04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:10.126
the ground and breathe for a second. "I'm very
tough, I'm very big, I'm very strong. I've

04:13:10.126 --> 04:13:12.253
"abandoned my son!"

04:13:12.253 --> 04:13:21.879
TRAVIS: I just realized what I wanted to do with
my-- Is dead grandma 60 feet away from me now or

04:13:21.879 --> 04:13:23.110
further?

04:13:23.110 --> 04:13:29.856
LIAM: (counting) You don't have anything left.
She's within range of 60 feet, but you've done all

04:13:29.856 --> 04:13:30.959
that stuff.

04:13:30.959 --> 04:13:32.573
TRAVIS: I have a bonus action, don't I?

04:13:32.573 --> 04:13:33.930
LIAM: For claw.

04:13:33.930 --> 04:13:38.765
TRAVIS: Speed, action to dash. No, as a bonus
action, I can use my Blood Curse of the Marked.

04:13:38.765 --> 04:13:43.790
Mark an enemy within 60 feet and deal double
Crimson Rite damage to it until the end of your turn.

04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:47.108
LIAM: Does it say sight? Do you have to see her?

04:13:47.108 --> 04:13:49.152
TRAVIS: It does have to be in sight.

04:13:49.152 --> 04:13:52.156
LIAM: That's okay. A lot of new rules here, a lot
of stuff happening.

04:13:52.156 --> 04:13:53.885
SAM: Werewolves are tough, man.

04:13:53.885 --> 04:13:56.713
LAURA: Werewolves, blood hunters.

04:13:56.713 --> 04:13:57.567
ERICA: Yes.

04:13:57.567 --> 04:13:58.374
LAURA: Curses.

04:13:58.374 --> 04:13:59.199
ERICA: All of it!

04:13:59.199 --> 04:14:02.203
SAM: Whoever wrote these blood hunters and lycans
is just--

04:14:02.203 --> 04:14:03.198
ERICA: What a weirdo.

04:14:03.198 --> 04:14:03.688
SAM: Terrible.

04:14:03.688 --> 04:14:05.223
TRAVIS: Probably had blonde hair.

04:14:05.223 --> 04:14:08.280
SAM: Yeah. Right now, where do you think he is
right now?

04:14:08.280 --> 04:14:11.157
TRAVIS: You mean what plane?

04:14:11.157 --> 04:14:12.796
SAM: Yes, what plane of existence.

04:14:12.796 --> 04:14:15.384
TRAVIS: It's probably under the firmament.

04:14:15.384 --> 04:14:18.456
LIAM: You're about to find out.

04:14:18.456 --> 04:14:22.649
ERICA: When it's my turn. I'm not ready to ask
it.

04:14:22.649 --> 04:14:23.934
SAM: It's almost your turn.

04:14:23.934 --> 04:14:28.199
ERICA: It's not yet, though. It's going to be, but
it's not.

04:14:28.199 --> 04:14:30.553
LAURA: It doesn't say it has to be?

04:14:30.553 --> 04:14:42.184
LIAM: Lucius, you feel a single hand spank down
hard on your shaved head, and you feel a creeping,

04:14:42.184 --> 04:14:43.060
crawling--

04:14:43.060 --> 04:14:44.380
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

04:14:44.380 --> 04:14:50.333
LIAM: --vomitous sensation radiate through your
whole body as necrotic damage radiates in through

04:14:50.333 --> 04:14:54.986
the back of your head and you take 26 points of
necrotic damage.

04:14:54.986 --> 04:14:56.210
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

04:14:56.210 --> 04:14:57.377
SAM: Is this a spell?

04:14:57.377 --> 04:14:58.416
LIAM: Yes.

04:14:58.416 --> 04:14:59.939
SAM: Is this an attack spell?

04:14:59.939 --> 04:15:00.868
LIAM: Yes.

04:15:00.868 --> 04:15:05.427
SAM: I will invoke my Blood Curse of the Fallen
Puppet.

04:15:05.427 --> 04:15:06.855
LIAM: Does it say anything about sight?

04:15:06.855 --> 04:15:09.251
SAM: I need to know that the spell's being cast.

04:15:09.251 --> 04:15:10.275
TJ: I scream?

04:15:10.275 --> 04:15:12.697
SAM: I'm right up on grandma. I don't know if--

04:15:12.697 --> 04:15:13.990
TJ: I scream: Spell!

04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:17.007
SAM: Oh, this is being cast by invisible fucktod.

04:15:17.007 --> 04:15:21.555
LIAM: It says, "Rend the spell from the air." I'm
going to nix that. I'm going to say he's

04:15:21.555 --> 04:15:31.367
invisible. There was no preconceived notion of it.
All you heard was (smack) "Ooh!" and it's done.

04:15:31.367 --> 04:15:34.614
SAM: Oh, Lucius.

04:15:34.614 --> 04:15:35.687
TJ: Ouch.

04:15:35.687 --> 04:15:45.067
LIAM: You feel just a bit of breeze behind you--
There's no save for that, no-- A bit of breeze

04:15:45.067 --> 04:15:50.019
behind you and a step, you hear it. The moment's
passed.

04:15:50.019 --> 04:15:51.159
TJ: Thank you.

04:15:51.159 --> 04:15:52.954
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.

04:15:52.954 --> 04:15:55.546
LIAM: It is the Iron Woe's turn.

04:15:55.546 --> 04:15:56.616
SAM: The Iron Woe.

04:15:56.616 --> 04:16:04.278
LIAM: The Iron Woe. She's just going to lay into
what she's facing, which is Benicio.

04:16:04.278 --> 04:16:06.464
ERICA: Werewolves of woe.

04:16:06.464 --> 04:16:15.140
LIAM: Yep, hits. 18, beats your armor class.

04:16:15.140 --> 04:16:16.655
SAM: Oh yeah, sure.

04:16:16.655 --> 04:16:25.589
LIAM: That is 12 points of slashing damage. Then
she leans in to bite, she hasn't bitten anybody,

04:16:25.589 --> 04:16:32.864
and she still hasn't bitten anybody 'cause she
rolled a three. She's just snapping away. Can't

04:16:32.864 --> 04:16:43.723
get anyone. She's pretty pissed. That's it, she's
just going to stay there. Now it is Aurra's turn.

04:16:43.723 --> 04:16:47.308
ERICA: All right, can I Flaming Sphere this lady?

04:16:47.308 --> 04:16:48.791
LIAM: Sure you can.

04:16:48.791 --> 04:16:50.796
ERICA: I was going to say something else, but I
didn't say it.

04:16:50.796 --> 04:16:52.334
LIAM: You can say that if you want.

04:16:52.334 --> 04:16:54.458
ERICA: I don't want to say it. I'm not going to
say it. She's my grandma; I'm not going to say it

04:16:54.458 --> 04:16:55.321
about her.

04:16:55.321 --> 04:16:56.416
SAM: Yeah, don't disrespect your grandma.

04:16:56.416 --> 04:17:00.912
ERICA: I'm not going to. She's like an Iron Woe or
whatever, but I'm not going to go there about it.

04:17:00.912 --> 04:17:03.884
But yes, I would like to Flaming Sphere at her.

04:17:03.884 --> 04:17:12.225
LIAM: Okay, so you drag your hands in a giant circle
in front of you and-- about as big as an exercise

04:17:12.225 --> 04:17:19.722
ball-- a giant bowling ball of flame springs to
life right in front of you and you send it, I

04:17:19.722 --> 04:17:28.078
assume, towards her. So careening through, and you
guys see it coming. Portia, you see it coming,

04:17:28.078 --> 04:17:33.138
Benicio, you do not. It hits this and actually
does a little skateboard trick, kills Laura,

04:17:33.138 --> 04:17:41.106
bounces down, and lands right next to the Iron
Woe, burning and the fire flashes out from it,

04:17:41.106 --> 04:17:45.476
connecting with her. She has to make a dex save.

04:17:45.476 --> 04:17:48.564
SAM: You got this.

04:17:48.564 --> 04:17:49.856
ERICA: All right.

04:17:49.856 --> 04:17:54.044
LIAM: What's your spell DC? It's on your character
page, on the bottom right.

04:17:54.044 --> 04:17:55.072
ERICA: 15.

04:17:55.072 --> 04:17:59.571
LIAM: She doesn't make it. So she takes full
damage.

04:17:59.571 --> 04:18:01.258
LAURA: 2d6?

04:18:01.258 --> 04:18:03.376
LIAM, SAM, and LAURA: 2d6.

04:18:03.376 --> 04:18:04.937
SAM: So roll the square one twice.

04:18:04.937 --> 04:18:09.842
LIAM: Unless you want to cast it at a higher
level, but that ship has passed, I guess.

04:18:09.842 --> 04:18:12.435
ERICA: Seven.

04:18:12.435 --> 04:18:15.148
LIAM: Seven points of damage, and that Flaming
Sphere is out here.

04:18:15.148 --> 04:18:16.449
SAM: It just stays?

04:18:16.449 --> 04:18:17.525
LIAM: It stays.

04:18:17.525 --> 04:18:19.452
ERICA: Can I direct it another time?

04:18:19.452 --> 04:18:21.410
LIAM: Not for this turn.

04:18:21.410 --> 04:18:23.767
ERICA: My next turn, though, I could
theoretically.

04:18:23.767 --> 04:18:26.097
LIAM: That's right. Lucius, you are up. Unless you
want to move somewhere.

04:18:26.097 --> 04:18:27.611
SAM: You have a bonus action.

04:18:27.611 --> 04:18:30.011
LIAM: Oh, you have a hasted action and movement.

04:18:30.011 --> 04:18:36.325
SAM: Hasted action, and movement. Hasted action
she could only do a melee hit.

04:18:36.325 --> 04:18:37.785
ERICA: What?

04:18:37.785 --> 04:18:42.323
LIAM: You can move 60 feet because you're the
Flash right now and you could claw her if you got

04:18:42.323 --> 04:18:43.373
up on her.

04:18:43.373 --> 04:18:45.584
ERICA: Okay, I'm going to do that then. That's
what I'm doing.

04:18:45.584 --> 04:18:50.879
LIAM: Okay, so you just crouch low and run.
(counting)

04:18:50.879 --> 04:18:52.181
ERICA: Three claws? Am I?

04:18:52.181 --> 04:18:53.744
LIAM: You don't get three claws, you get one.

04:18:53.744 --> 04:18:57.947
ERICA: What is with the one? So frustrated by
this. Fine, all right, here we go.

04:18:57.947 --> 04:18:59.196
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question?

04:18:59.196 --> 04:19:00.197
LIAM: Yeah.

04:19:00.197 --> 04:19:03.288
TRAVIS: If the drow casts a spell, he can stay
invisible after casting it?

04:19:03.288 --> 04:19:09.914
LIAM: No, he can't, you're right. That's right.
We'll get to that in a moment.

04:19:09.914 --> 04:19:11.202
TRAVIS: Yep.

04:19:11.202 --> 04:19:12.607
SAM: It's plus five.

04:19:12.607 --> 04:19:15.744
ERICA: The clawing, all right. No, it's nine. It's
not a thing.

04:19:15.744 --> 04:19:16.909
LIAM: Okay.

04:19:16.909 --> 04:19:19.653
SAM: You have a bonus action if you wanted to heal
anyone.

04:19:19.653 --> 04:19:20.658
LAURA: That was the bonus--

04:19:20.658 --> 04:19:21.884
ERICA: Was that it?

04:19:21.884 --> 04:19:23.831
LIAM: The bonus action was the missed slash.

04:19:23.831 --> 04:19:24.813
ERICA: Oh.

04:19:24.813 --> 04:19:25.783
LIAM: You just tried to slash, right?

04:19:25.783 --> 04:19:26.708
ERICA: I did.

04:19:26.708 --> 04:19:34.204
LIAM: Yeah. So got a retcon: when you cast while
invisible, it goes. So what I want to do is let

04:19:34.204 --> 04:19:38.899
you know that in your peripheral vision after
getting spanked in the back of the head-- the drow

04:19:38.899 --> 04:19:41.276
is behind you, and bolts away in this direction.

04:19:41.276 --> 04:19:42.208
TJ: Great.

04:19:42.208 --> 04:19:43.934
LIAM: So you get an attack of opportunity if you
want.

04:19:43.934 --> 04:19:44.903
TJ: Yes, please.

04:19:44.903 --> 04:19:45.917
LIAM: Go for it.

04:19:45.917 --> 04:19:48.181
TRAVIS: Yeah, I forgot when you cast when you're
invisible you reveal.

04:19:48.181 --> 04:19:51.265
SAM: For the bad guy?

04:19:51.265 --> 04:19:56.040
LIAM: Yeah, that's why Caleb wouldn't do anything
in that dungeon forever.

04:19:56.040 --> 04:19:57.197
SAM: Is he visible now?

04:19:57.197 --> 04:19:58.154
LIAM: He's visible now.

04:19:58.154 --> 04:19:59.095
SAM: Where is he?

04:19:59.095 --> 04:20:01.367
LIAM: He is here.

04:20:01.367 --> 04:20:02.585
SAM: Oh!

04:20:02.585 --> 04:20:06.284
LIAM: He's about to run away from Lucius.

04:20:06.284 --> 04:20:06.738
TJ: 17.

04:20:06.738 --> 04:20:10.250
LIAM: This is a rewinding of time-- Ah! I keep
hitting that-- That hits.

04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:21.376
TJ: Yes! Six points of damage.

04:20:21.376 --> 04:20:22.837
LIAM: Okay, got it.

04:20:22.837 --> 04:20:24.273
TJ: My sickle slashes through his back.

04:20:24.273 --> 04:20:25.226
TRAVIS: Yeah it does.

04:20:25.226 --> 04:20:30.474
LIAM: He cries out and keeps running, and now
we're on your actual turn.

04:20:30.474 --> 04:20:37.758
TJ: How much space is between the drow and the
Iron Woe?

04:20:37.758 --> 04:20:44.431
LIAM: I'm going to put him here. (counting) 25
feet, 30 feet.

04:20:44.431 --> 04:20:50.793
TJ: Okay. First I'm going to move the Moonbeam on
top of the Iron Woe.

04:20:50.793 --> 04:20:58.690
LIAM: Great. That almost waterfall of bright pale
light gushing out of the hole in nothing just

04:20:58.690 --> 04:21:05.823
drags across the ground and centers on the Iron
Woe, and she has to make a con save. Does not make

04:21:05.823 --> 04:21:06.914
it; I rolled a three.

04:21:06.914 --> 04:21:17.136
TJ: Whew. That is 2d10, yeah. 15 points of
damage.

04:21:17.136 --> 04:21:26.397
LIAM: Bits of bone shard, dark and solid as it is,
start to chip away and she is starting to

04:21:26.397 --> 04:21:27.448
fragment.

04:21:27.448 --> 04:21:28.353
TRAVIS: Yeah!

04:21:28.353 --> 04:21:29.420
LAURA: She's looking rough.

04:21:29.420 --> 04:21:32.725
SAM: (whispers) Okay, this is good.

04:21:32.725 --> 04:21:42.457
TJ: Then I send the Spiritual Weapon after the
drow and it's a shiny and silver scimitar, so I'd like--

04:21:42.457 --> 04:21:48.158
LIAM: And it can only move 20 feet. It was
attacking her before.

04:21:48.158 --> 04:21:50.162
TJ: Okay then I'll keep it on her, if I can.

04:21:50.162 --> 04:21:51.356
LIAM: You can, yeah.

04:21:51.356 --> 04:21:52.168
TJ: Great.

04:21:52.168 --> 04:21:53.607
LIAM: So I don't think it would make it to the
drow, but you can, sure.

04:21:53.607 --> 04:22:02.766
TJ: That is (counting) 17?

04:22:02.766 --> 04:22:06.130
LIAM: 17 on the Iron Woe does not hit.

04:22:06.130 --> 04:22:07.734
TJ: (groans)

04:22:07.734 --> 04:22:09.832
TRAVIS: Both times.

04:22:09.832 --> 04:22:11.064
LIAM: (exhales) Okay.

04:22:11.064 --> 04:22:14.633
TJ: And is that an action or does Spiritual Weapon
do its own thing?

04:22:14.633 --> 04:22:16.300
LIAM: Spiritual Weapon is a bonus action.

04:22:16.300 --> 04:22:17.765
TJ: Great. And--

04:22:17.765 --> 04:22:23.138
LAURA: Oh my god, those were two spells you have up
that you can just attack with. That's badass.

04:22:23.138 --> 04:22:25.512
TJ: Mm. It should've.

04:22:25.512 --> 04:22:27.858
LAURA: Yeah, because Spiritual is not a
concentration.

04:22:27.858 --> 04:22:29.048
TJ: It is not.

04:22:29.048 --> 04:22:31.178
LIAM: Wow, that's badass.

04:22:31.235 --> 04:22:32.083
LAURA: Yeah.

04:22:32.083 --> 04:22:33.033
ERICA: (quietly) What?

04:22:33.033 --> 04:22:35.850
LIAM: Woo! Moonbeam's concentration but Spiritual
is not. Wow.

04:22:35.850 --> 04:22:38.093
SAM: It's like this guy's played before.

04:22:38.093 --> 04:22:39.021
TJ: And--

04:22:39.021 --> 04:22:40.069
ERICA: It is as though.

04:22:40.069 --> 04:22:42.074
TRAVIS: It's like he has color coded sheets.

04:22:42.131 --> 04:22:43.032
TJ: Do I--

04:22:43.032 --> 04:22:44.832
(laughter)

04:22:44.832 --> 04:22:48.024
TJ: Do I know anything about drow?

04:22:48.024 --> 04:22:50.544
LIAM: Make a history check.

04:22:50.544 --> 04:22:54.784
TJ: No.

04:22:54.784 --> 04:22:56.393
(laughter)

04:22:56.393 --> 04:22:58.981
TJ: No I don't. I know nothing.

04:22:58.981 --> 04:23:05.174
LIAM: No, only what you hear about the Dwendalian
Empire's efforts against them, but not them.

04:23:05.174 --> 04:23:06.451
TJ: Nasty and sneaky.

04:23:06.507 --> 04:23:07.367
TRAVIS: Terrible.

04:23:07.367 --> 04:23:08.468
TJ: They're horrible.

04:23:08.468 --> 04:23:25.523
Yeah-- no-- yes. I don't want to get slapped in the
back of the head again. (laughs) I will cast

04:23:25.523 --> 04:23:29.829
Spirit Guardians on myself.

04:23:29.829 --> 04:23:40.685
LIAM: Okay. Got it. And three beings of light
appear around you, translucent but formidable.

04:23:40.685 --> 04:23:42.116
TRAVIS: Whoa.

04:23:42.116 --> 04:23:51.791
TJ: And I step closer to the Iron Woe so that it's
within the reach, but I stay on the other side of

04:23:51.791 --> 04:23:53.980
the stalagmite.

04:23:53.980 --> 04:24:01.304
LIAM: Spiritual Guardians; 15 feet; concentration.
So Moonbeam is down.

04:24:01.304 --> 04:24:04.426
TJ: Oh, then if it's-- it is concentration?

04:24:04.426 --> 04:24:07.490
LIAM: Concentration up to 10 minutes. You can
retcon it, it's fine.

04:24:07.490 --> 04:24:08.514
TJ: I didn't see concentration.

04:24:08.514 --> 04:24:09.525
LIAM: You would know your shit.

04:24:09.525 --> 04:24:12.186
TJ: No, I thought I wrote them down, but it did not
write concentration.

04:24:12.186 --> 04:24:15.948
LIAM: No I don't mean you, I mean Lucius would
know that one would cancel out the other. So if

04:24:15.948 --> 04:24:17.440
you want Moonbeam up, Moonbeam's up.

04:24:17.440 --> 04:24:18.644
TJ: Yeah, Moonbeam's the more important I think.

04:24:18.644 --> 04:24:19.713
LIAM: Moom. Moombeam.

04:24:19.713 --> 04:24:20.815
TJ, TRAVIS, and LAURA: Moombeam.

04:24:20.815 --> 04:24:21.900
ERICA: Moombeam.

04:24:21.900 --> 04:24:23.203
TJ: I will Guiding Bolt.

04:24:23.203 --> 04:24:25.419
LIAM: And Guiding Bolt is?

04:24:25.419 --> 04:24:30.355
LAURA: (singing) Guiding Bolt, her up the butt.

04:24:30.355 --> 04:24:34.217
ERICA: What is it with the butt, guys? Come on.

04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:37.507
LIAM: That's a spell attack, right?

04:24:37.518 --> 04:24:38.838
TJ: It is.

04:24:38.838 --> 04:24:40.833
LIAM: Go for it.

04:24:40.852 --> 04:24:43.233
LAURA: (singing) Give us an advantage on the next
attack!

04:24:43.233 --> 04:24:46.400
ERICA: Okay, are we taking it there; is that what's
happening right now?

04:24:46.400 --> 04:24:49.668
TJ: (inhales) 24.

04:24:49.668 --> 04:24:50.852
LIAM: That hits.

04:24:50.852 --> 04:24:51.728
SAM: Wow.

04:24:51.728 --> 04:24:52.696
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:24:52.696 --> 04:24:55.914
LAURA: (deadpan fanfare)

04:24:55.914 --> 04:24:56.965
SAM: "I would like to pray."

04:24:56.965 --> 04:24:58.053
TRAVIS: "I pray."

04:24:58.053 --> 04:25:01.106
ERICA: (quietly sings) What is happening?

04:25:01.106 --> 04:25:02.596
SAM: TJ's doing all the moves.

04:25:02.596 --> 04:25:08.565
TJ: Aww, 13 points of damage.

04:25:08.565 --> 04:25:09.723
LIAM: Okay.

04:25:09.723 --> 04:25:12.313
SAM: Just "okay."

04:25:12.313 --> 04:25:20.242
LIAM: Good, no, another rib splinters out and
sticks sideways. She's starting to lean to the

04:25:20.242 --> 04:25:21.461
side a bit.

04:25:21.461 --> 04:25:24.340
TJ: Whoever attacks next has advantage on the
attack.

04:25:24.340 --> 04:25:27.281
LIAM: It is Portia's turn.

04:25:27.281 --> 04:25:28.934
SAM: Por-tia!

04:25:28.934 --> 04:25:29.871
LAURA: Sweet.

04:25:29.871 --> 04:25:32.577
TJ: Also she still has the Mark of Waning still
upon her.

04:25:32.577 --> 04:25:34.750
SAM: C'mon, take her down, Portia.

04:25:34.750 --> 04:25:36.796
LAURA: All right, I'm going to run up to her.

04:25:36.796 --> 04:25:38.483
LIAM: Do it, Portia.

04:25:38.483 --> 04:25:41.384
LAURA: Do I get advantage on all three attacks, or
just the first attack?

04:25:41.384 --> 04:25:43.769
LIAM: If you're flanking, you mean?

04:25:43.769 --> 04:25:48.448
LAURA: From the Guiding Bolt. I think it's just
the first attack, so I'm going to flank her.

04:25:48.448 --> 04:25:51.210
LIAM: First attack, okay. That's easy enough to
do.

04:25:51.210 --> 04:25:53.014
LAURA: That's not me.

04:25:53.014 --> 04:25:55.337
LIAM: That's not you? Oh, that's our druid, sorry,
you're--

04:25:55.337 --> 04:25:58.585
LAURA: I'm the reddish one. Right.

04:25:58.585 --> 04:26:01.452
LIAM: Blue bottom, okay.

04:26:01.452 --> 04:26:03.049
LAURA: Yes, but the reddish paint.

04:26:03.049 --> 04:26:06.507
LIAM: So five, ten, 15, 20, done.

04:26:06.507 --> 04:26:19.621
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to hit her! 17 plus
something; that first one hits. Second one,

04:26:19.621 --> 04:26:22.363
natural 20!

04:26:22.363 --> 04:26:23.835
ALL: Nice!

04:26:23.835 --> 04:26:25.272
LIAM: So it was hit, natural 20?

04:26:25.272 --> 04:26:33.319
LAURA: Hit, natural 20. Third is 11 plus six, 16.
No, 17.

04:26:33.319 --> 04:26:34.230
LIAM: Nope.

04:26:34.230 --> 04:26:35.167
LAURA: Still doesn't hit.

04:26:35.167 --> 04:26:36.808
SAM: Some points, some damage.

04:26:36.808 --> 04:26:44.529
LAURA: First one. Eight plus five is 13. And then
the critical.

04:26:44.529 --> 04:26:46.203
SAM: This is it.

04:26:46.203 --> 04:26:52.038
LAURA: Aw man. Eight plus five is 13 again.

04:26:52.038 --> 04:26:53.230
LIAM: 13 again?

04:26:53.230 --> 04:26:53.933
LAURA: Yeah.

04:26:53.933 --> 04:27:01.939
LIAM: Okay. You strike out and grab and rake at
her hip and you tear an entire hip bone away and

04:27:01.939 --> 04:27:03.744
throw down to the ground.

04:27:03.744 --> 04:27:04.732
TRAVIS: Nice.

04:27:04.732 --> 04:27:17.670
LIAM: She is staggering on her feet, she is still
up, and she is angry at you and drags a claw

04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:20.495
across your face.

04:27:20.495 --> 04:27:26.196
LAURA: It's not considered a weapon attack, is it?
It's just a claw attack?

04:27:26.196 --> 04:27:30.765
LIAM: It's a claw attack, for 16 points of
slashing damage.

04:27:30.765 --> 04:27:32.538
SAM: Ooh, yikes.

04:27:32.538 --> 04:27:34.149
LAURA: Zoinks!

04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:37.633
LIAM: That was a legendary action.

04:27:37.633 --> 04:27:40.374
LAURA: Oh no, I'm almost dead!

04:27:40.374 --> 04:27:41.859
LIAM: Are you unconscious?

04:27:41.859 --> 04:27:42.644
LAURA: No!

04:27:42.644 --> 04:27:43.568
LIAM: No? Oh!

04:27:43.568 --> 04:27:44.654
LAURA: I'm still standing.

04:27:44.654 --> 04:27:46.876
LIAM: Okay. Benicio, you're up.

04:27:46.876 --> 04:27:56.355
SAM: I'm sorry, Grandma! And I will attack,
terribly. I will attack again, much better, 23.

04:27:56.355 --> 04:27:57.700
LIAM: What are you using?

04:27:57.700 --> 04:27:58.913
SAM: My glaive.

04:27:58.913 --> 04:28:02.624
LAURA: We're flanking her, yo, so you're at
advantage.

04:28:02.624 --> 04:28:03.544
LIAM: Yeah, you're at advantage.

04:28:03.544 --> 04:28:04.483
SAM: Oh, so that's the first attack?

04:28:04.483 --> 04:28:05.766
TJ: May I move closer to my father?

04:28:05.766 --> 04:28:17.090
SAM: That's a 23 to hit. All right, and that is 15
points of damage.

04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:27.501
LIAM: 15 points of damage. You smash the glaive
across her face and her lower jaw flies and

04:28:27.501 --> 04:28:36.022
clatters into the stone and hits the ground. She
stands pathetic, teetering in front of you. Is

04:28:36.022 --> 04:28:37.155
this the bonus action?

04:28:37.155 --> 04:28:40.003
SAM: This is my second attack, also at advantage?

04:28:40.003 --> 04:28:41.531
LIAM: Yeah, you're flanking.

04:28:41.531 --> 04:28:48.498
SAM: That's crazy. Miss. Bonus. Natural 20!

04:28:48.498 --> 04:28:50.199
ALL: Yeah!

04:28:50.199 --> 04:28:54.790
TRAVIS, TJ, LAURA, and ERICA: (howling)

04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:59.179
SAM: The bonus strike is less, guys. The bonus
strike is only a d4 plus three.

04:28:59.179 --> 04:29:02.385
LIAM: Benicio, how do you want to do this?

04:29:02.385 --> 04:29:10.755
SAM: I would like to stick the glaive through her
pelvis bone and just kind of go around in a

04:29:10.755 --> 04:29:13.395
circle.

04:29:13.395 --> 04:29:14.601
LAURA: I'll duck every time.

04:29:14.601 --> 04:29:15.998
SAM: And then let go!

04:29:15.998 --> 04:29:26.201
LIAM: You drive the glaive right through her
entire form and then you just drag and push, and

04:29:26.201 --> 04:29:32.958
push, and use that force, that torque as you go to
unwind her body and pull bone off, and bone off,

04:29:32.958 --> 04:29:42.616
and bone off. She falls to her bony knee, down to
her chest, claws at the ground, and rests still.

04:29:42.616 --> 04:29:48.726
SAM: In your face, Lawrence! That's how a man does
it!

04:29:48.726 --> 04:29:50.696
TJ: The elf! I point.

04:29:50.696 --> 04:29:53.712
LIAM: And it's your turn.

04:29:53.712 --> 04:30:00.326
TRAVIS: I've just finished running with my claws out
in the air, and I see the little motherfucker run,

04:30:00.326 --> 04:30:07.515
and I'm like: Bitch! I'll use my bonus action to
now Blood Curse of the Marked on the drow.

04:30:07.531 --> 04:30:08.897
LIAM: Okay.

04:30:08.897 --> 04:30:11.777
TRAVIS: And I will close the distance on him and
take three swipes--

04:30:11.777 --> 04:30:13.409
TJ, LAURA, AND ERICA: Yes!

04:30:13.409 --> 04:30:15.957
TRAVIS: --with my Crimson Rite claws.

04:30:15.957 --> 04:30:20.221
LIAM: You can make (mumbling) until the end of
your turn. Are you amplifying or just doing the

04:30:20.221 --> 04:30:21.159
basic?

04:30:21.159 --> 04:30:22.377
TRAVIS: Amplifying.

04:30:22.377 --> 04:30:24.723
LIAM: So take 1d6 damage.

04:30:24.723 --> 04:30:26.252
TRAVIS: 1d6 or just six?

04:30:26.252 --> 04:30:28.745
LIAM: 1d6 for amplify.

04:30:28.745 --> 04:30:30.899
TRAVIS: Three points of damage.

04:30:30.899 --> 04:30:32.948
LIAM: Okay, go for it.

04:30:32.948 --> 04:30:41.721
TRAVIS: Natural 20 on the first one. Second one
is--

04:30:41.721 --> 04:30:49.274
LIAM: Wait, you used your movement to get to him.
That's (counting) 30, you're not quite there.

04:30:49.274 --> 04:30:50.498
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

04:30:50.498 --> 04:30:56.202
LIAM: I'll give you your action to get there and
your bonus action for that natural 20.

04:30:56.202 --> 04:31:15.271
TRAVIS: I'll take that, that seems very fair.
Great, okay. So that's going to be (counting) 22

04:31:15.271 --> 04:31:21.368
points of damage with the lightning Crimson Rite.
Oh, and I double the Crimson Rite damage, which was

04:31:21.368 --> 04:31:26.118
the crit, so it was 12 points of Crimson Rite
damage--

04:31:26.118 --> 04:31:26.764
LAURA: So 24!

04:31:26.764 --> 04:31:31.294
TRAVIS: --so 24 on top of the ten, so 34.

04:31:31.294 --> 04:31:32.462
LIAM: 34 total?

04:31:32.462 --> 04:31:33.439
TRAVIS: 34 total.

04:31:33.439 --> 04:31:36.230
LIAM: Nasty. Okay--

04:31:36.230 --> 04:31:38.195
LAURA: With one fucking bonus attack.

04:31:38.195 --> 04:31:39.456
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know.

04:31:39.456 --> 04:31:43.069
SAM: Wow. The drow is down?

04:31:43.069 --> 04:31:45.474
LIAM: Did I get it wrong? Yeah, the Iron Woe.

04:31:45.474 --> 04:31:57.166
TRAVIS: One square away from getting the other
two, fuck!

04:31:57.166 --> 04:32:03.746
LAURA: What is he doing?

04:32:03.746 --> 04:32:05.072
LIAM: Shit!

04:32:05.072 --> 04:32:06.158
TRAVIS and ERICA: What?

04:32:06.158 --> 04:32:14.543
LIAM: Wasn't good. The drow reaches out to grab
you and you just bat the arm away, and

04:32:14.543 --> 04:32:27.129
you see almost worms, black disgusting energy
dripping off. You see a look of real fear and he

04:32:27.129 --> 04:32:28.533
starts to go.

04:32:28.533 --> 04:32:29.384
SAM: He's running?

04:32:29.384 --> 04:32:30.588
LAURA: You get another attack on him!

04:32:30.588 --> 04:32:31.843
TRAVIS: I do get an attack of opportunity.

04:32:31.843 --> 04:32:33.028
LIAM: Yes, you do.

04:32:33.028 --> 04:32:38.960
TRAVIS: That's cocked. That's a 19 plus--

04:32:38.960 --> 04:32:40.097
LIAM: Hits.

04:32:40.097 --> 04:32:52.966
TRAVIS: Yeah. (counting) 15 points with the
lightning damage.

04:32:52.966 --> 04:33:05.447
LIAM: 15, okay. You rake a canal down this man's
back, and he is staggering away down this hall

04:33:05.447 --> 04:33:11.897
pathetically, blood just pouring down his back.
He's on his feet and he looks like shit.

04:33:11.897 --> 04:33:12.955
TRAVIS: Damn!

04:33:12.955 --> 04:33:15.345
LIAM: Aurra, it's your turn.

04:33:15.345 --> 04:33:16.884
SAM: Aurra!

04:33:16.884 --> 04:33:17.897
LAURA: Don't let him get away!

04:33:17.897 --> 04:33:18.872
SAM: End him. Spill him!

04:33:18.872 --> 04:33:23.888
ERICA: I send Wind Wall to block his passage. Can
I do this?

04:33:23.888 --> 04:33:29.618
LIAM: That's super cool, let's see how we can make
it work. Aurra, Wind Wall.

04:33:29.618 --> 04:33:37.118
ERICA: Help me, he'll die. I will send Wind Wall.
He'll give me strength through this so that I.

04:33:37.118 --> 04:33:41.292
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can totally do that!

04:33:41.292 --> 04:33:42.828
ERICA: This is what I want.

04:33:42.828 --> 04:33:45.505
LAURA: She just picks a point on the ground and he
has to make a save.

04:33:45.505 --> 04:33:46.745
LIAM: What's the range on it though?

04:33:46.745 --> 04:33:48.775
LAURA: 120 feet!

04:33:48.775 --> 04:33:50.935
ERICA: It is so far; it's as far as I want.

04:33:50.935 --> 04:34:02.496
LIAM: Oh, yeah, that's great. He is so low, I will
say that you just walk calmly, throw up your hands

04:34:02.496 --> 04:34:14.233
and that energy flies out of your hands, flies
just over Lawrence's head and a cyclone of

04:34:14.233 --> 04:34:24.806
frenetic, angry energy spins this asshole like a
dryer tumbler in that hallway because you have just

04:34:24.806 --> 04:34:31.804
shoved a Wind Wall in a very small space, sending
it starting here through there like a snake. I

04:34:31.804 --> 04:34:38.218
could roll, but he is beaten back and forth
against the sides of that passage and his head

04:34:38.218 --> 04:34:45.030
softens into pulp, and he is turned into a bloody
mess and lies on the ground.

04:34:45.030 --> 04:34:47.396
LAURA: (howls) That was my howl, did you like it?

04:34:47.396 --> 04:34:52.385
ERICA: It's good, that was good. Full enthusiasm
on that one.

04:34:52.385 --> 04:34:55.142
LIAM: The room is still.

04:34:55.142 --> 04:35:01.405
SAM: I would like to use my Blood Curse of the
Fallen Puppet--

04:35:01.405 --> 04:35:03.419
LIAM: On the drow?

04:35:03.419 --> 04:35:04.766
SAM: On the dead drow.

04:35:04.766 --> 04:35:05.949
LIAM: To do what?

04:35:05.949 --> 04:35:12.590
SAM: I want him to wake up and, with his last bit
of life, give Lawrence a wedgie.

04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:14.003
TRAVIS: Fuck you!

04:35:14.003 --> 04:35:21.793
LIAM: You have to roll-- that's a straight roll.

04:35:21.793 --> 04:35:23.394
SAM: Yeah, sure.

04:35:23.394 --> 04:35:27.947
LIAM: I need you to roll something to see if this
works. No, let's do this. Lawrence, make a dex save.

04:35:27.947 --> 04:35:29.707
TRAVIS: Yeah, give me a shot, man!

04:35:29.707 --> 04:35:31.534
LIAM: I remember Grog trying to pants Vax.

04:35:31.534 --> 04:35:36.151
LAURA: What is it? Natural 20?

04:35:36.151 --> 04:35:37.058
TRAVIS: 19.

04:35:37.058 --> 04:35:38.407
SAM: I'm going to amplify--

04:35:38.407 --> 04:35:41.980
TRAVIS: Can I do the same?!

04:35:41.980 --> 04:35:45.755
SAM: --which adds my wisdom modifier to it, which
is a plus four.

04:35:45.755 --> 04:35:48.367
TRAVIS: Roll like shit.

04:35:48.367 --> 04:35:49.889
SAM: I don't know, do I roll? What am I doing?

04:35:49.889 --> 04:35:54.159
LIAM: Yeah, you got to roll, this is outside the
tenets of Dungeons & Dragons.

04:35:54.159 --> 04:35:55.388
SAM: Six plus four.

04:35:55.388 --> 04:35:56.507
TRAVIS: Yeah!

04:35:56.507 --> 04:36:03.221
LIAM: The mangled corpse does move, but the bones
are broken, so it's just this shambling,

04:36:03.221 --> 04:36:08.103
disgusting mess, and it slops onto Lawrence's
front--

04:36:08.103 --> 04:36:10.523
TRAVIS: What the fuck?! Get off of me!

04:36:10.523 --> 04:36:13.294
LIAM: --and then slimes to the ground.

04:36:13.294 --> 04:36:15.061
TRAVIS: Benicio!

04:36:15.061 --> 04:36:22.764
SAM: Wasn't me, bro. He just really must hate you.
Oh, blood is coming out of me! I just took two

04:36:22.764 --> 04:36:24.240
points of damage.

04:36:24.240 --> 04:36:37.324
LIAM: You know, it's late here at the studio, so
I'm going to eulogize this game and tell you, you've

04:36:37.324 --> 04:36:46.883
saved your father, which I didn't anticipate. It's
the middle of the night, you take Hal back to your

04:36:46.883 --> 04:36:58.988
family home, and he doesn't speak for the entire
walk back. He looks very shaken. Haunted. You get

04:36:58.988 --> 04:37:09.096
him back to his room, and the five of you, standing
around him as he would want, comfort him and

04:37:09.096 --> 04:37:20.122
encourage him to talk, and he spends the next hour
telling you how this man attacked the keep with a

04:37:20.122 --> 04:37:33.478
small army of undead. Slaughtered everyone in the
castle, except for him. He then asks you to sit

04:37:33.478 --> 04:37:46.312
down, and explains to you that the man that you've
just finished was your grandfather.

04:37:46.312 --> 04:37:48.462
SAM: The drow?

04:37:48.462 --> 04:38:09.809
LIAM: He did come from Xhorhas and he did have a
torrid romance with Genevieve Lorelei. His people

04:38:09.809 --> 04:38:23.975
came for him to drag him back. Genevieve Lorelei
was killed, the drow's twin brother was killed,

04:38:23.975 --> 04:38:43.398
and he was taken back to Xhorhas to be realigned.
He also asks that in the weeks that follow, you

04:38:43.398 --> 04:38:58.163
help him to reseal the tomb below, and to learn
from this misstep in the family line, and though

04:38:58.163 --> 04:39:12.663
there is darkness, it doesn't mean that the light
is gone and to hold onto that. He reiterates that

04:39:12.663 --> 04:39:15.225
he loves you very much.

04:39:15.225 --> 04:39:18.010
LAURA: But you love me most.

04:39:18.010 --> 04:39:35.866
LIAM: He shakes his head. "Some days." He drifts
off to sleep, and the five of you look across your

04:39:35.866 --> 04:39:50.046
father in bed, asleep, safe, and rethink your
future plans in relation to the House Lorelei. And

04:39:50.046 --> 04:39:51.314
that's where we'll end the story.

04:39:51.314 --> 04:39:52.567
TRAVIS: Yeah!

04:39:52.567 --> 04:39:53.865
SAM: Liam O'Brien.

04:39:53.865 --> 04:40:02.598
TRAVIS: So good! You never went wolf! Very smart,
though. He was way more powerful that way. He

04:40:02.598 --> 04:40:04.017
saved our ass.

04:40:04.017 --> 04:40:08.129
LIAM: Man, every time I run these games I'm like,
"I'm going to make it shorter this time. I'm going

04:40:08.129 --> 04:40:10.663
"to keep it--" It's impossible! It's impossible!

04:40:10.663 --> 04:40:12.415
TRAVIS: Erica!

04:40:12.415 --> 04:40:14.365
ERICA: Aww, thanks!

04:40:14.365 --> 04:40:15.902
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah!

04:40:15.902 --> 04:40:16.985
ERICA: First time.

04:40:16.985 --> 04:40:18.867
LAURA: Man, a druid, that's a hard one to go on
first time.

04:40:18.867 --> 04:40:21.187
LIAM: No, you did great! Everyone should play
D&D!

04:40:21.187 --> 04:40:24.927
SAM: But not start with a druid.

04:40:24.927 --> 04:40:27.963
TRAVIS: Unless you got a good tutor!

04:40:27.963 --> 04:40:30.496
LAURA: It is, like, the hardest class.

04:40:30.496 --> 04:40:31.449
ERICA: Really?

04:40:31.449 --> 04:40:37.304
LIAM: Well guys, Burning Man will soon be done,
we'll be back to our regular scheduled

04:40:37.304 --> 04:40:46.014
programming. We look forward to having our three
wandering travelers back. But for now, I don't

04:40:46.014 --> 04:40:52.032
know what is said. Be good to each other, love one
another. Try to be good, and is it Thursday yet?

04:40:52.032 --> 04:41:00.720
ALL: Yeah! (howling)

04:41:00.720 --> 04:52:03.941
[music]
