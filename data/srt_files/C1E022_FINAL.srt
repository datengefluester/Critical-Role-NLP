1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,690
MATT: Hello and good evening, everyone, and
welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:09,074
crazy, zany, nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons
and Dragons. For those of us meeting us for the

3
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:14,449
first time, welcome; this is us playing DND from a
homebrew campaign with a few homebrew rules, but

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,380
overall, it's a fun time. Couple of announcements
I want to get over before we start up the game:

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,959
One, we have a subscriber challenge, apparently,
every 100 subscribers we get, we are giving away a

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:34,395
signed poster of the cast of Critical Role, as
well as a signed portrait or a giant poster of a

7
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:38,940
beautiful piece of art by Kit Buss, our official
artist. The cast will be signing both of those and

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,723
giving those away to whoever wins and every 100
subscribers whoever is active in the chatroom will

9
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:49,621
be opting in to be chosen randomly for that prize,
so we'll keep an eye out for that and we will be

10
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:54,704
announcing those winners as they come in. So that's
every 100 subscribers. Also, there is a challenge

11
00:00:54,704 --> 00:01:00,220
that if we can manage to hit 7,000 subscribers by
the beginning of the day tomorrow, the streaming

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:09,169
tomorrow, one, there will be apparently some sort of
Pikachu costume will be purchased and worn around

13
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,509
the studio. This is all the information I have,
and I'm excited at the vagueness that was

14
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:17,021
presented to me, because that could mean anything,
which, you know, with enough pressure, peer

15
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:19,960
pressure especially, anyone can be put into a
Pikachu costume.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,035
ZAC: Not anyone.

17
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:30,206
MATT: (laughs) Anyone. Also, there is apparently a
promise for a party tomorrow evening with some fun

18
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:34,962
guests and performers if we manage to hit 7k by
the beginning of tomorrow's stream. This has been

19
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:42,135
given to me by our gracious Overlord. Also,
apparently the mods have their own challenge if we

20
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:47,122
hit 7k by tomorrow that I've been told I don't
really need to mention, which means I'm going to

21
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:53,300
mention it, because apparently, there will be a
Snugglelord or Overlord body pillow made. I think

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,372
you should try and make that happen.

23
00:01:55,372 --> 00:02:01,982
ZAC: I asked really politely for that not to be
mentioned. Cool, no, I'm going to remember that.

24
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:09,861
MATT: How could you not mention that?! How could
you not mention that? So 7k, guys. See if we can,

25
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:15,387
see if we could make that happen, because I think
it means if one can be made, many can be made and

26
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:21,161
I think all of us here at Critical Role would be happy to
have copies for ourselves. So that's now up in the

27
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:28,652
air. Let's see. A couple other quick announcements: we
also have our charity, 826LA, they're a fantastic

28
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:36,091
charity, 826 across the nation, but especially
we're donating to 826LA. They have afterschool

29
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:42,791
programs and a lot of tutoring for creative
writing skills and general literacy skills-- I

30
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:48,565
can't talk today-- for kids from five up to
late teens. They're a great charity; check them

31
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:55,539
out. We really appreciate you guys' support in
that. Also, we will have a one week break in

32
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:59,552
Critical Role next week as both me and Marisha
will be out of town doing that thing in the

33
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:03,944
desert, so we'll be gone for a week, but we will
return the week after, so that will be the second

34
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:11,068
week of September to pick up our regular Critical
Role schedule from there. I think that's it, and

35
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,837
that's all. Let's see if anybody else have any
major announcements.

36
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:15,194
TRAVIS: Love you.

37
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,353
MATT: Oh, Grog's being sweet over there. We'll
have some fun things to show when we come back,

38
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:23,977
but in the meantime, let's go ahead and get
ourselves ready to jump on in to our next session

39
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:25,218
of Critical Role.

40
00:03:25,218 --> 00:04:33,862
[dramatic music]

41
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:38,731
MATT: All right, guys. Welcome back. Picking up
where we left off to give you guys some overview

42
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:46,309
here, the party had put themselves in a situation
where they-- Taliesin is currently cleansing the

43
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:49,982
area of Wil Wheaton's dice rolls from the previous
two weeks.

44
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:52,499
LAURA: Feel better?

45
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:56,128
TALIESIN: We'll see if I feel better.

46
00:04:56,128 --> 00:05:00,135
MARISHA: No, it does. The energy feels better.

47
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:02,106
TALIESIN: No, feeling better.

48
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:05,583
LIAM: If there's one place to use the
flamethrower, I think it's on that.

49
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,537
TALIESIN: It's right there. Salt the earth.

50
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:11,596
LAURA: No, like you're not so much right there.

51
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:15,664
LIAM: I was being facetious; I didn't see it. I'm
so comforted that it's on your wrist right now.

52
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:21,980
MATT: That's okay, we'll look for it later. I
think we may be down one Scanlan tonight;

53
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,235
unfortunately, Sam couldn't make it. So we will be
missing our gnome bard for the evening. I know,

54
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:36,075
he's got family stuff planned tonight. Ohana means family
in a language that doesn't exist in this world.

55
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:44,263
That's okay. The party had unknowingly broken the
law of Vasselheim and as such, found themselves

56
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:49,383
in a conundrum where they had to choose either to
go to the seat of judgment and be judged for

57
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:54,174
breaking the law, or they could join the Slayer's
Take, which is a guild of monster hunters in the

58
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:59,621
town, which they caused this infraction towards.
They agreed to instead join the guild. However, in

59
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:03,866
doing so, they had to undergo a trial. The trial
involved the party being split into two different

60
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:09,339
groups and set on a journey to hunt a specific
creature for each group, along with a couple of

61
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:14,220
newcomers. So we had our couple guest episodes for
each group, separate to do their own little

62
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,175
venturing. Everybody survived, which was good.

63
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:20,206
(cheering)

64
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:22,048
TALIESIN: Not everybody.

65
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,788
MATT and LAURA: Oh.

66
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:35,060
MATT: We'll get to that. We will be coming back to
the game in just a moment. Real fast, Travis, you

67
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,539
should show us the really cool little thing that
you--

68
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:45,743
TRAVIS: For my birthday, I got this. This is
really great and heavy.

69
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:51,032
ORION: If it was sharp, it would be a functional
weapon.

70
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:53,719
LAURA: It is a functional weapon without
sharpening.

71
00:06:53,719 --> 00:07:04,619
MATT: So between that and Orion's wrist-mounted
fireball launcher, we are covering all the bases.

72
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:07,320
MARISHA: We have Liam's daggers. Laura's gotten a
bow.

73
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,631
LAURA: I have; I can't wait to shoot.

74
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:13,680
TRAVIS: Matt got a cloak.

75
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,545
MATT: I did get a cloak. We're slowly being
converted by you guys into our respective roles.

76
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:23,766
LIAM: I think the one that I'm the most nervous
about receiving in the mail is necrotic.

77
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:27,437
(laughter)

78
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:30,723
LIAM: Somewhere, there's a guy working in a morgue
going, "Oh!"

79
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,906
TALIESIN: That's coming to my house. It's going to
my house, right there.

80
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:41,018
MATT: All right, so as the party that was sent to
hunt down the rakshasa successfully completed

81
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:46,533
their venture, have been waiting very nervously
for a few nerve-wracking days, as they knew it was

82
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:54,794
a three-day journey, day four crawls around and
the other half of Vox Machina has yet to return.

83
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:59,584
They have been staying within the confines of the
Slayer's Take guildhall and you can sense the

84
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:07,226
energy itself is tense in the air. Mertin and the
Huntmaster have done their best to keep you calm,

85
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:12,364
brought you what you need, and assure you that
this was not a very difficult task they sent them

86
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:18,012
on, but even as the days wane on, you can sense
that their overwhelming confidence seems to be

87
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:28,116
slowly faltering as well. It's about midday on the
fourth day when you hear a few loud thumps from

88
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:35,201
out in the foyer area. You hear some low voices
for a while, some conversations, some laughter,

89
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:46,747
one particularly high, screechy voice you're not
familiar with that then slowly disappears. Moments

90
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:51,743
of quiet pass, and there is a knock at your guys'
door on the far side of the guildhall.

91
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:55,825
MARISHA: Do you guys want to get it?

92
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,177
LIAM: I got it!

93
00:08:57,177 --> 00:09:05,255
MATT: You open the door. Waiting there, you see
Mertin standing there and his red, scruffy,

94
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:11,081
scarred-up halfling self with a sly grin, as he
looks over his shoulder. "It's good to see you! I

95
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:17,259
"am pleasured to give you information that the rest
of your allies have returned and you are requested

96
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,321
"immediately in the foyer area of the Guildhall."

97
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:20,558
MARISHA: I just run past him.

98
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:22,223
MATT: You push him aside.

99
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:23,639
ORION: Really, they're alive?

100
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,259
MATT: "From what I can tell, at least most of
them. I wasn't counting to be honest, but I--" The

101
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,977
rest of you push past, rushing down the main other
hallway that opens up into the main foyer area. You

102
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:38,261
can see the hanging iron chandeliers are shifting
slightly from the impact of the door slam. As you

103
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:45,407
immediately peer around the side, you can see
before you Vex, Grog, Percy, and Scanlan, all

104
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:51,470
there, with little Trinket in the back, looking a
little chilled. They look a little worse for wear,

105
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:58,016
but definitively alive, as they have just received
their payment for their Slayer's Take trial

106
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,342
contract.

107
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:04,890
ORION: I run up to Vex and I give her a big hug.

108
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,465
MARISHA: I run up to Percy.

109
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,686
TALIESIN: Ow, ow!

110
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:12,236
TRAVIS: I hold out my arms for Vax.

111
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,524
TALIESIN: (pained) No, it's very nice to see you
too, ow.

112
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:17,171
TRAVIS: Everybody else is getting a fucking hug.

113
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:20,756
LIAM: I'm walking very cautiously. Hey, come here,
big guy.

114
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:24,535
TRAVIS: Yeah! And I just squeeze him in, rub him
amongst my breasts.

115
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:30,021
LIAM: You smell like, ugh.

116
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:35,808
MATT: Scanlan stands there with his arms open. "If
only she was here..."

117
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:38,636
MARISHA: I've been drinking a lot of water.

118
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:42,103
MATT: "That's all right, we made enough money to
make the rest of my evening interesting."

119
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:43,682
LIAM: Come here, you. Tousle.

120
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:46,334
LAURA: He almost died! How did you do?

121
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:52,256
LIAM: I don't think we almost-- (softly) Hi.

122
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:55,109
TRAVIS: Oh, for fuck's sake.

123
00:10:55,109 --> 00:11:03,043
ORION: As they're hugging, I go to Grog and I--
how big are you? I have missed you too. I had no

124
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,131
idea how much I would miss both of you.

125
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,336
MARISHA: I'm so glad you guys are alive.

126
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:10,360
ORION: Where's Percy? Oh there he is!

127
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,017
TALIESIN: Ow!

128
00:11:12,017 --> 00:11:19,935
MATT: During this extremely awkward massaging,
teat-milking process--

129
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,452
ORION: I was hugging!

130
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:34,349
MATT: A loud triple hand clap breaks the momentary
gushy sharing of positive energy. Looking across

131
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:39,048
the way you can see sitting on the corner of the
main central cleric desk is Huntmaster Vanessa

132
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:47,132
with her hands in the air. "Very well, I am glad
to see that you have all survived. It is, I cannot

133
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:53,457
"say not heart-warming to see you all enjoying the
reunion so well, although I had a very big

134
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:59,782
"breakfast and would prefer if this were to stop
immediately. You have all proven to be very worthy

135
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:06,565
"of joining this esteemed guild. I am pleased to
have such talent amongst our ranks because of it.

136
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:14,910
"Now, if you could please follow me, I shall reveal
to you one of our great secrets. One you must

137
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:23,236
"keep." And with that intensity you see the general
white color of her eyes flashes yellow for a

138
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:29,659
second. "The time has come to brand you as new
members. Please to be following me."

139
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:36,105
LAURA: Please to be following you.

140
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:38,499
TRAVIS: Did she say brand?

141
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:43,236
MATT: She turns around. Mertin joins her side and
the two begin walking towards the back side of the

142
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:48,632
foyer, towards the hallway that was on the left
side of the back area. You guys continue to follow

143
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:55,712
them down a long hallway that is just door after
door after door on both sides. Just closed, seems

144
00:12:55,712 --> 00:13:01,985
like almost a good ten or so doors on each side of
this doorway as you progress. You do manage to

145
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:05,743
come across one door that is open and it leads
into a darkened training area where you see two

146
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:10,927
Slayer's Take members are currently in the process
of training with two training dummies in this dirt

147
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:15,598
sandpit area. As you guys walk past, they stop and
look over their shoulders and give you a nod as

148
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:23,129
you continue past. You get to the very end of
this darkened hallway, where you see before you a

149
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:30,407
very intimidatingly large solid iron door. No
hinges, just a large slab of iron with bolts into

150
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:36,772
it. Flanking it are two very well armed and
armored members of the guild. Burly humans with

151
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:41,436
heavily tattooed skin. From what you can see, each
one of them, their shoulder exposed, you can see

152
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:47,165
the same marking into it. The Slayer's Take mark
comes across as almost like a scarred brand in

153
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,786
that type of shape and design.

154
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,986
LAURA and MARISHA: That's cool.

155
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:56,353
LAURA: We're going to have very skilled people
branding us, I'm sure.

156
00:13:56,353 --> 00:14:02,494
MATT: Vanessa looks over her shoulder. (laughs) "I
think you'll be hard-pressed to find someone more skilled."

157
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:05,119
TALIESIN: Does that mean they're not skilled?

158
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:13,825
MATT: At this point, the two gentlemen standing
either side of the door stand up and give a small

159
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,817
bow to the Huntmaster.

160
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:21,303
MARISHA: Do we get to choose where we get
branded?

161
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:30,339
MATT: At this point, after hearing this loud
metallic tensing sound as the two guys have now

162
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,040
grabbed these wheels that are bolted into the
sides of the door and are winching them down. And

163
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,510
you can see as they are pulling, you can hear the
sound of chains grinding and growing tense. And

164
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,633
the iron door (metal and stone scraping), slowly
raises up, revealing a darkened hallway that

165
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:49,440
descends down stairs, about 15 feet wide.

166
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,582
LAURA: Perception?

167
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:51,627
MATT: Go for it.

168
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,292
LIAM: What could go wrong?

169
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,283
LAURA: Let's use this one. Oh, that was great.

170
00:14:56,283 --> 00:15:01,943
ORION: Has everybody realized, they want to burn
things into us?

171
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,999
LIAM: We've done worse things to each other.

172
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,958
LAURA: Oh, even less. It's a nine, total.

173
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,590
MATT: Nine total. Good to know. That stairway
looks pretty sturdy. That darkness looks pretty

174
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,369
dark. Even with your darkvision.

175
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:14,933
LIAM: 20.

176
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,554
TALIESIN: Can I use my passive perception?

177
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:22,548
MATT: Well, keeping that in mind. As you look
inside, you can see there are torches bolted to

178
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:28,262
the wall that give a very low ember light, and
they are spaced out about every 20 feet or so.

179
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,130
ORION: Not enough. Light!

180
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,533
LAURA: Oh, there we go.

181
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:37,356
MATT: Okay. As you cast Light, it brightens up the
room for a second, the two guards wince to the

182
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:41,180
side and Vanessa spins around and says, "Fool, put
that out this instant!"

183
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,318
ORION: But it's brighter! Oh, okay, sorry.

184
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,533
(laughter)

185
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:47,954
TALIESIN: He had a point.

186
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:49,931
TRAVIS: He's not wrong.

187
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:57,040
MATT: Her intense demeanor softens for a moment
and she goes, "There is a process to this. I

188
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,893
"appreciate your patience."

189
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,331
LAURA: We must be branded in the dark, Tiberius.

190
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:07,603
MATT: She turns around and continues down the
stairs. Do you guys follow below?

191
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:08,980
TALIESIN: I'm last.

192
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,694
TRAVIS: I put Percy in front of me.

193
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:14,242
ORION: I saunter in.

194
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,576
MATT: Okay. What's the walking order in this?

195
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,830
LAURA: Oh no!

196
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,780
MATT: What's the order?

197
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,809
TRAVIS: Yeah, what is the order? Who's anxious?
You seem jazzed.

198
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,201
LIAM: I'm in front.

199
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,759
LAURA: All right, fine, I'm behind him.

200
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,466
ORION: I'll be right after Vex.

201
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:29,228
MARISHA: I'll be after Tiberius.

202
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:30,516
TRAVIS: I'm the caboose!

203
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:31,795
MATT: All right.

204
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:34,728
TRAVIS: I don't think the caboose makes sense
now!

205
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,133
LIAM: Grog doesn't know that!

206
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,499
(laughter)

207
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,458
MATT: There we go. And Percy, you're where?

208
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,177
TALIESIN: Well, Grog says I'm right in front of
him.

209
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:48,820
MATT: All right, so you're walking alongside
Scanlan. You're staying near Grog to hide behind.

210
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:57,561
All right, so as you guys descend down these
stairs. The first thing that catches you is the

211
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:08,524
air itself has a very old smell to it. Almost like
the interior of a dust-covered antique store or a

212
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:17,844
long-forgotten and untouched tomb. It has that
smell of ancient sediment to it. You continue down

213
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:25,167
the stairs until eventually it opens into a
large, darkened chamber. The ground itself has a

214
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:30,890
soft, almost sandy bottom. Turn that shit off,
whoever's phone that was!

215
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,724
TALIESIN: That wasn't me! It might've been me.

216
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,588
MATT: All good. (laughs) Check your phones. No
worries.

217
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:39,509
MARISHA: It might've been me.

218
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:47,962
MATT: As you step into the chamber, what little bit
of light there is begins to brighten as you enter

219
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:55,292
the main area, and you can see before you what
looks like a beautiful stone sanctuary in the

220
00:17:55,292 --> 00:18:02,931
center of this chamber, built of white limestone
with gold-inlaid trim and designs. Strange

221
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:09,241
sandstone, almost obelisks, that frame a large
ziggurat-like platform that rises in the center of

222
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:16,254
this chamber just standing there in the stillness.
These little torches placed amongst the entire

223
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:23,566
thing brighten as you step forward and frame the
visual of this strange, ancient structure.

224
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:31,541
LAURA: Pardon me, Vanessa. I thought you were just
a band of hunters?

225
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:36,160
MATT: (shushing) "Do you trust me?"

226
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,116
TALIESIN: Not really, no.

227
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:46,728
ORION: I'm going to agree with the room. But you
are nicer, which is different.

228
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,577
TALIESIN: And we're locked in.

229
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:55,256
MATT: "Well, either you follow or you leave and we
leave you to the machinations of the seat of

230
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,564
"judgment, and you can deal with the law of
Vasselheim."

231
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:59,477
LAURA: Let's do it!

232
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:00,901
LIAM: We're here. We're with you.

233
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,697
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're on board.

234
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:05,459
MARISHA: The law of Vasselheim, for not getting
branded?

235
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:10,521
MATT: "All right. Then follow me." And she steps
toward the front of this ziggurat-type structure

236
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:15,631
which has a staircase that is very wide at the
bottom and slowly pinches as it reaches the top of

237
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:23,635
the structure about 25 feet up. As you begin
walking up the stairs, I believe you have the

238
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:32,543
highest passive perception. You notice there are
small symbols carved in various ways throughout

239
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:36,845
the entirety of this structure's design. Very
faintly along the trim of the bottom of some of

240
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:41,389
the stonework, also largely placed on the top of
these obelisks on different sides. It resembles an

241
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,180
eye placed within a sickle.

242
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,023
LIAM: What are you looking at?

243
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:50,496
LAURA: There's some weird stuff up high.

244
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:53,470
LIAM: Like spider webs?

245
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,801
LAURA: No, like eyeballs. Is it like eyeballs?

246
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,957
MATT: It's a single eye that is placed within a
sickle-like curvature that has a handle to

247
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:01,218
it. Almost like that.

248
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,547
LAURA: Is it moving?

249
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:05,583
MATT: No, it's just a carving in the stonework
that resembles an eye.

250
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,973
LAURA: Oh, okay.

251
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,422
LIAM: I don't see an eye.

252
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:14,575
LAURA: It's that carving right there. looks like
an eye. Does anybody know anything about anything

253
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:16,754
that looks like eyes?

254
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:19,105
MATT: This would be more of a religion check for
anybody who has--

255
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:20,186
TALIESIN: Religion check?

256
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:20,995
MATT: Religion.

257
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:21,928
LAURA: Can I try?

258
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:23,584
MATT: You can, you're welcome to make a--

259
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:25,949
LAURA: Natural 20!

260
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:29,864
MATT: There you go. Start it off. The sage
worked!

261
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:33,433
TALIESIN: (splutters)

262
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:38,914
MATT: Looking at it, you immediately get the
thought that this symbol represents Ioun, which is

263
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:45,838
the goddess of knowledge, prophecy, and skill. Not
one of the heavily worshipped-- you haven't seen

264
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:51,559
really any bastion of worship of Ioun in the
city yet. It's always been those main five. This

265
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,118
is the first temple to Ioun you've seen since
you've been here, and it's definitely been under

266
00:20:55,118 --> 00:21:01,277
here for quite some time. As you guys get to the
very top of the structure, you can see before you,

267
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:07,227
the top of the ziggurat-like platform is about 50
feet across on each side. In the center there is a

268
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:14,451
small raised platform about five feet high, four
feet high, almost like a table or altar of some

269
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:20,980
kind that is circular in its shape, and partially
embedded in this is a large, solid glass

270
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,159
globe-like sphere that is probably a good three
feet in diameter.

271
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,213
LAURA: Does it look like anything we've seen
before?

272
00:21:27,213 --> 00:21:32,990
MATT: Not anything you've seen before, per se.
It's perfectly clear and it just sits there at

273
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,986
rest.

274
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:35,929
LIAM: Is this where the burning happens?

275
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:39,999
MATT: Vanessa seems to have not paid attention to
your phrase and just shouts up into the darkness

276
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:53,527
and goes, "Osysa! Osysa, come! We have fresh blood
for you!" At which point, a loud roar breaks

277
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:59,068
through the darkness, shaking the interior of the
chamber where dust and sand begins to settle from

278
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,459
the ceiling, which had been waiting there for
quite some time.

279
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,008
LIAM: Was this in the fine print?

280
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,851
MARISHA: Guys, I'm thinking this might be a cult?

281
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:09,496
TRAVIS and LAURA: That was a really high squeak.

282
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,005
MARISHA: I'm a little nervous!

283
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:16,309
MATT: At this point, suddenly there's a shift in
movement from the shadows behind the ziggurat, and

284
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:22,881
leaping up onto the platform before you guys, you
see movement and fur and rippling muscle. What you

285
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:30,427
see before you looks to be a giant lion-like body.
(thud) Steps onto the top of the ziggurat. These

286
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:37,510
giant, griffon-like wings (whoosh) flare out, and
as the light cascades up, you can see now atop

287
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:45,399
this lion body is a female-like human face
wreathed with a mane of ashy-blonde hair. Jewelry

288
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:51,297
wrapped around the neck and the shoulders. You see
as it looks down, the eyes peering across all of

289
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:55,810
you. No pupils, just a glowing straight sky-blue
color.

290
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,935
LIAM: Are you the one that's going to be doing the
branding?

291
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:08,923
MATT: This little growl with a chuckle to it.
(laughs) A feminine smile comes to its lips as it

292
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:19,125
bends down and looks over the rest of you. "I have
watched from afar, Hunters. I sensed your arrival

293
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:30,231
"and the spark of darkness you carried. I saw your
fate bend towards ours and cross. At this

294
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:39,043
"intersection, I greet you, and welcome you, proven
ones, to our family." And she bows and closes her

295
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,960
eyes ever so slightly.

296
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,513
TRAVIS: We return the bow. I return the bow.

297
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:46,214
LAURA: I look at Grog, like what?

298
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:48,327
TRAVIS: It's a fucking lion with wings!

299
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:52,074
ORION: I'll do the Draconic sort of--

300
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:55,300
TRAVIS: You saw Harry Potter, the hippogriff will
jack you up! Bow back!

301
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,793
LAURA: I nod.

302
00:23:56,793 --> 00:24:03,745
MATT: She acknowledges everyone's existence. And
you see now, Huntmaster Vanessa is also in a very,

303
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:12,716
very deep bow, and stands, giving you all this
look of, don't do anything stupid. "I have been

304
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:16,091
"keeper of this temple for hundreds of years--"

305
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:18,632
ORION: You don't look a day over 20!

306
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:22,963
LIAM: Smooth.

307
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:28,501
MATT: There's a brief moment where she gives you
this keen look, head to the side like a curious

308
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:37,853
creature. "Interesting. Humor does not find its
way to my chambers often enough these days."

309
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,629
ORION: That's unfortunate.

310
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:42,889
MATT: "I appreciate your candor, dragonborn."

311
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:46,458
MARISHA: She likes jokes!

312
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:53,760
MATT: "Now, we've built this into a tradition that
you have all now come into. And at this moment,

313
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,969
"you will come to bear the mark and be known as our
allies." Her eyes suddenly flare up with an

314
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:09,347
intense blue flame for a second. All of you,
simultaneously, at that moment feel this sharp,

315
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:13,851
sudden burning sensation in your right shoulder.
You instinctively reach over and grab towards it.

316
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,498
(hissing)

317
00:25:15,498 --> 00:25:17,306
LAURA: It just happened?! Like that?

318
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:22,062
MATT: You reach over and pull, and there's no heat
on the arm, but there is that burning pain. You go

319
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:27,150
and you look under, pulling your armor to the side
best you can and look. And there, over your right

320
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,114
shoulder you can see this same brand that you saw
adorning the shoulder of Vanessa when she exposed

321
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,522
it earlier, as well as the two guards at the
gate.

322
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:36,546
MARISHA: Can you hold it up again?

323
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:43,236
MATT: It is now raised upon your skin, seemingly
already healed. Like a long-healed burn or brand

324
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:50,236
mark. And the pain slowly subsides into a dull
sensation, but it is not a fresh burn. There is

325
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:54,282
not any peeled skin. It looks like it maybe
happened a few months ago, and yet there it is.

326
00:25:54,282 --> 00:25:56,182
LAURA: Not going to lie, it looks pretty cool.

327
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:57,563
ORION: The design is nice.

328
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,383
TALIESIN: I'd have liked some warning.

329
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,849
LIAM: Join a few more clubs, and we're going to be
all sleeved up.

330
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:16,376
MATT: "Now, I have been here building this place
and this guild for some time, with the intent of

331
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:25,057
"helping rid the landscape of dangerous prey and
helping those who are also aligned with the good

332
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:35,278
"of the realm to bring their more powerful
enchantments and uses to light."

333
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:43,751
LAURA: Can we insight check and see if she's
telling the truth? 24.

334
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:49,556
MATT: 24! It would've been good if I remembered to
bring my dice out. There we are. It's been a

335
00:26:49,556 --> 00:27:02,461
rushed-- yeah. She appears to be forthright and
honest. There is a force of personality to her

336
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:10,045
that speaks beyond any sort of mortal you've
encountered, and even the extraplanar entities

337
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:17,496
you've discussed with, there seems to be a
forthrightness in her speech. You don't feel

338
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:24,891
there's any layer of deceit involved. She glances
down at the glass sphere that's embedded in the

339
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:30,441
altar, and as she looks down, what was once clear
glass slowly begins to glow with the same

340
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:39,387
white-blue light as her eyes. "It is here through
this Heartglass that Ioun herself extends my

341
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:49,314
"vision to watch the world. From here, I can see
where our quarry lies and lays rest. When

342
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:56,740
"contracts are brought to our attention, I can see
if they can or cannot be hunted. I can see where

343
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:08,123
"the worlds flow between. I can watch over my mate,
wherever far he may be. This gift came at a price

344
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:16,463
"to me, but the good I can do, that we can do, is
far more important than my sacrifice."

345
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,716
LIAM: How far does your vision fall?

346
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:29,600
MATT: "The limits fall to where will would be bent
against what wishes to be seen. In person, I can

347
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,725
"peer through many veils, but the further I tread
with my sight, the more barriers of those who wish

348
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:46,326
"not to be followed can keep me at bay. I've only
tried to pierce through the Abyss once. That was a

349
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:56,526
"dire mistake. However, you have come to understand
one of our great secrets. Keep this with you,

350
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:04,767
"carry the brands on your shoulders with pride, for
you are now considered Chosen of Ioun, and myself.

351
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:09,149
"Welcome to the Slayer's Take."

352
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:13,438
ORION: I take this with great honor. Thank you.

353
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:23,072
MATT: She gives a nod to all of you. She now
stands back up. The orb goes back to a dull clear

354
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:28,584
glass. Turns around. (heavy footfalls) the tail
(whoosh) swishing over your heads for a moment.

355
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:37,422
The wings expand, and with a great leap, the
creature disappears into the darkness. If you want

356
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:38,700
to make an arcana check.

357
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,104
LAURA: Has the glass totally faded?

358
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:42,415
MATT: The glass has faded, yes.

359
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:47,339
ORION: I'll take that. 24.

360
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:54,914
MATT: 24. You've heard of entities like this. This
is a sphinx entity, specifically referred to as a

361
00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:55,990
gynosphinx.

362
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,179
TRAVIS: What?!

363
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,346
MARISHA: Dinosphinx?

364
00:29:58,346 --> 00:29:59,360
MATT: Gynosphinx.

365
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,657
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Gynosphinx.

366
00:30:00,657 --> 00:30:02,460
ORION: Highly erotic.

367
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,237
MATT: You hear a snarl from the distant shadows.
No.

368
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:12,985
ORION: I'm still trying to figure out his
sexuality.

369
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:15,225
TRAVIS: You didn't check for the bits?

370
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:16,566
ORION: I don't know.

371
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:28,014
MATT: A gynosphinx is a feminine sphinx entity
that specializes in being able to peer past lies,

372
00:30:28,014 --> 00:30:35,257
to peer past magical veils. You can see how this
altar, this sphere is an extension of that power,

373
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:36,967
though even that has its limits.

374
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:39,062
TRAVIS: Good thing we didn't try to lie.

375
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:44,372
MATT: At which point Vanessa turns around to the
rest of you. "Well, then. I think that went rather

376
00:30:44,372 --> 00:30:45,534
"well, yes?"

377
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:46,833
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

378
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,009
LAURA: A little warning next time, Vanessa.
Maybe.

379
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:50,863
MATT: "I like the element of surprise."

380
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:57,861
MARISHA: So question. The little blue flashy thing
that happens with the eyes. Is that going to

381
00:30:57,861 --> 00:30:59,730
happen with us now, too?

382
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,964
LAURA: Can she see through our eyes now?

383
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:13,568
MATT: She gives you a curious look. "I do not
know."

384
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:16,696
LAURA: She's not going to be happy with what she
sees through Scanlan's.

385
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:18,272
(laughter)

386
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,316
MATT: Scanlan's behind you going--

387
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:22,947
TALIESIN: Oh, I think she is. Very happy.

388
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,850
TRAVIS: Scanlan is the Cinemax of this group.

389
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:32,410
MATT: Scanlan says, "Well, if she's been in here
for 200 years unable to leave, she's going to be

390
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,780
"really happy with what I can offer."

391
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,768
LIAM: Peer into the scatological.

392
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:46,393
MATT: "It's a whole array of experiences that I
provide." As he puts on his mustache. Vanessa then

393
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:52,478
turns around and begins to step down the ziggurat.
"Well, then. Shall I lead you back to the guild

394
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:56,902
"hall proper? You are welcome to do as you wish.
You have been released, and I believe we have some

395
00:31:56,902 --> 00:32:02,726
"funds to give to you, as you are now officially
part of the hydra contract you originally broke."

396
00:32:02,726 --> 00:32:08,123
LAURA: Yay! I like the way you talk, Vanessa.

397
00:32:08,123 --> 00:32:15,134
LIAM: I have some questions, though. What is this
relationship, you and us, now? Are we obligated?

398
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:22,931
MATT: As you guys are walking back out of the
chamber towards the stairway, she goes, "There is

399
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:27,142
"no requirement for you, you are but a member of
the Slayer's Take. If you wish to come by, we have

400
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:31,584
"contracts available, and you can look about those
if you wish to take up. If you feel you are

401
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:36,057
"capable of doing it, let us know. You will then be
bound to that contract to complete it, but there

402
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:40,411
"is no requirement. There have only been a few
occasions that we have called our members to arms

403
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:47,483
"outside of contract, and that is usually when
there has been some sort of an outside-- for lack

404
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:53,925
"of a better term, a force that wishes ill to our
business. In which case, we protect our own. But

405
00:32:53,925 --> 00:33:00,355
"that's only happened twice since the inception of
this guild itself, so I would not worry. But we

406
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:05,702
"have work for you, should you need it. We have a
place to stay, and beyond that you are welcome to

407
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,144
"travel as you see fit."

408
00:33:07,144 --> 00:33:12,445
LIAM: What are your allegiances? To yourselves, to
the guild? Or to Vasselheim itself?

409
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:18,278
MATT: "We have many allegiances. Whatever makes
for the best business, to be honest. To tell you

410
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:20,447
"this, we like to make money."

411
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:22,116
LAURA: I respect that.

412
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:28,140
MATT: "We like to make sure that the city is
protected from entities, creatures, beings that

413
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,886
"would threaten the otherwise defenseless members
of this fine city."

414
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,215
LAURA: Very noble.

415
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:35,466
MATT: "And we like to make money."

416
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:38,549
TRAVIS: About that money, you said you owed us
some?

417
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:43,825
MATT: "Yes." And as you guys start descending the
stairs now, Mertin is a little bit ahead, and he

418
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:50,238
knocks on the outside of the iron door. You hear
it lift again, the rest of you make your way and

419
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:56,331
duck under the iron door as it's lifted up and you
make your way back into the guild hall hallway. As

420
00:33:56,331 --> 00:34:03,521
she leads you back to the foyer area, she says,
"Yes, so. Really, it's money, to be honest. But

421
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:11,876
"the money we make, we make generally for noble
causes. They do not harm people, and nothing

422
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:23,007
"terrible has come of it yet. Yet." And she laughs
to herself as she walks on and begins pulling from

423
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:29,824
underneath the main clerk desk again, pulling up a
few pouches and tossing them amongst you. There's

424
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:34,113
three of them, she says, "Spread as you see fit.
Based on the hydra contract..." She tosses them

425
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,978
amongst a random couple of you guys.

426
00:34:35,978 --> 00:34:37,430
ORION: Mage Hand.

427
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,394
LAURA: I thought I caught all three. I really
tried.

428
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:41,804
MATT: You caught two and Tiberius drifted one
down.

429
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:43,482
LAURA: How much is in that one?

430
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:45,024
ORION: I don't know.

431
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:51,093
MATT: You take a moment to count them all. Each
pouch breaks down to roughly 630 gold each, if

432
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:52,904
divided amongst the seven party members.

433
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:54,846
LAURA: All right, we'll divide it evenly.

434
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,568
LIAM: You're a fast counter.

435
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:59,636
MATT: 630 each. Can someone note 630 for Scanlan,
by the way.

436
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:00,807
TRAVIS: All right.

437
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,796
LIAM: 630 each, 630 for Scanlan, as he is not here
to do it.

438
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:12,300
Why, yes, Scanlan. I will take your share.
Thank you. I noticed Vanessa has some cookies on

439
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,611
her desk. Would somebody hand me one of Vanessa's
cookies? Thank you.

440
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:23,613
MATT: "These cookies were sent to me as a fine
gift from a friend of the guild. Sir Darin De Paul

441
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:27,270
"of Vasselheim's finest performance troupe."

442
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,634
LIAM: They set my nerves at rest.

443
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:36,787
LAURA: So we have a home here. We have rooms here.
We don't have to pay for lodging?

444
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:39,776
MATT: "Correct. You just stay wherever you like.
Mind you, there are probably more comfortable

445
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:42,189
"lodgings, but you do not have to pay to stay
here."

446
00:35:42,189 --> 00:35:43,809
LAURA: We're staying here!

447
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,775
TRAVIS: Are we free to go?

448
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:49,176
MATT: "Of course. I have no business at the
moment."

449
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:51,517
TRAVIS: You guys! We killed a dragon.

450
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,340
LIAM: Killed a what?

451
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:59,528
MARISHA: Yeah, they told us. Oh my god, we have so
much to tell you guys.

452
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:00,994
ORION: We killed a rakshasa.

453
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:01,944
TRAVIS: A what?

454
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:03,430
MARISHA: That's what I said!

455
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,588
TRAVIS: Wait, what's it called?

456
00:36:04,588 --> 00:36:06,085
ORION: It's a rakshasa.

457
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:08,321
LAURA: Does it do dances? I'm confused.

458
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:11,464
ORION: It had backward hands, so I do that because
it's weird.

459
00:36:11,464 --> 00:36:15,596
MARISHA: Saying his name is very-- you know.

460
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:20,432
LAURA: Oh. So you killed something that was
human-sized, then. Because we killed a dragon! A

461
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:22,529
big white dragon.

462
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:23,906
ORION: He had a big tiger head.

463
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:25,395
TRAVIS: He had a tiger head?

464
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:30,190
ORION: Yes, and he was an infernal demon and was
going to threaten all of our lives.

465
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,133
LIAM: Yeah, it wasn't a guy with a cat hat. He was
a demon.

466
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:37,846
ORION: A dragon is terrible, as well.

467
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:39,427
TALIESIN: No, that's impressive, too.

468
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:41,515
LAURA: Giant big giants.

469
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:43,122
ORION: Giants and dragons?

470
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,572
LAURA: Yes, we fought them both.

471
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,173
TRAVIS: There's some messed-up shit out here.

472
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:51,431
MARISHA: We went to a really high-end club and Vax
and I pretended to be married.

473
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:53,020
LAURA: Oh, you did?

474
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,914
LIAM: Yes.

475
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:56,393
LAURA: You did?

476
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:57,813
TRAVIS: Pretended.

477
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:07,885
LIAM: What? Girls like me! That's not hard to
believe! I can sell that, right? Percival, back me

478
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,162
up, please.

479
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:12,275
TALIESIN: You, you strike me as married, yes.

480
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:15,447
ORION: I turned into a half-elf as well. I was
very attractive.

481
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:17,543
TRAVIS: You did what? Really?

482
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:21,379
LAURA: I've always liked your human form,
Tiberius. I thought it was very attractive.

483
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:23,575
ORION: It's very opposite of how I look.

484
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,405
LIAM: I noticed-- Percival.

485
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:26,534
TALIESIN: Yes?

486
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:30,029
LIAM: Your coat is all frayed and fucked up. What
happened to your coat?

487
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,801
TALIESIN: (stutters) Well, I may have--

488
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:37,139
LAURA: Almost died. Percy, be honest.

489
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:38,685
TALIESIN: Almost died.

490
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:43,011
LIAM: The dragon breathed its fire on you?

491
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,198
TALIESIN: Well, not fire actually, but ice.

492
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:46,505
LIAM: Again?

493
00:37:46,505 --> 00:37:48,316
TALIESIN: Another ice dragon.

494
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:51,815
TRAVIS: Yeah, Scanlan took a little beating as
well, didn't you, Scanlan?

495
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:57,715
MATT: Which, he looks to you and goes, "And on
that note, you're welcome to stay here. I'm going

496
00:37:57,715 --> 00:38:04,162
"to go ahead and use my earnings to soothe this
pained, bruised pelvic region."

497
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:10,220
TRAVIS: (gasps) Tell them I'll be along shortly
for therapy.

498
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,125
MATT: "Of course."

499
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,754
TALIESIN: You're more married than him.

500
00:38:14,754 --> 00:38:17,162
LIAM: Scanlan. Lift from the legs.

501
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:20,048
(laughter)

502
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:27,922
MATT: "I shall." And he scurries out the front
door of the guild hall.

503
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:31,687
TRAVIS: Did any of you take a beating, or was it
just us?

504
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:35,186
MARISHA: We actually had a cleric with us.

505
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:41,809
LAURA: Oh, you did? We did not. What was he like?
He? I'm assuming it was a he.

506
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:50,655
ORION: Yes, he goes by the name of Kashaw. He was
a rather interesting fellow. And a surly dwarf, of

507
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:51,743
course.

508
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:55,223
TALIESIN: I've never met a dwarf that wasn't
surly.

509
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:57,242
TRAVIS: I like dwarves. Did he have an axe?

510
00:38:57,242 --> 00:39:02,398
LIAM: He did. He was a noble fellow. Having a bad
day.

511
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:05,315
TRAVIS: Having a bad day?

512
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:10,340
LIAM: Yeah. The cleric was nice. He planted one on
Keyleth.

513
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,928
TRAVIS: Planted one what? Like a tree?

514
00:39:13,928 --> 00:39:16,418
LIAM: You want to explain it, druid?

515
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:19,084
TRAVIS: Are you blushing?

516
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:20,539
TALIESIN: She's blushing.

517
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:24,448
LAURA: Keyleth. Lady Keyleth!

518
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:29,475
MARISHA: You just got mad at me for
pretend-marrying your brother, so.

519
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:32,437
LAURA: Well, now that I know you're interested in
some cleric, I don't care.

520
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,547
MARISHA: I'm not interested--

521
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:36,641
TRAVIS: Do you have a crush on Cashew?

522
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:37,726
MARISHA: No?

523
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:46,435
ORION: See, how it worked is that he thought that
she was really annoying, but really he was

524
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:48,180
attracted to her.

525
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,580
LAURA: Well, who wouldn't be, Keyleth? You are
gorgeous.

526
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,600
MARISHA: He was very nice.

527
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,053
LAURA: I'm bummed we had two ladies with us.

528
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:58,536
MARISHA: Oh, really?

529
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:04,176
TRAVIS: Did you guys get anything I should put in
the Bag of Holding? Any cool trinkets and bits?

530
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:07,713
LAURA: Oh yeah. In fact, we should probably take
the carpet back now that Grog has the Bag of

531
00:40:07,713 --> 00:40:08,707
Holding.

532
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:11,280
TALIESIN: It was a shame we didn't have it. It
would have come in so handy for our adventure.

533
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,548
ORION: Vax, you should tell your sister.

534
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:16,013
MARISHA: That should come from you.

535
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,131
LIAM: It's a funny story. It's really funny.

536
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:28,517
MARISHA: Yeah, looking back it is. You know what
actually, hang on, stop. Do we have any ale on us?

537
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:30,288
We should have a drink real fast.

538
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:34,438
TRAVIS: Oh, we always have ale! I pull out the
cask and I pass around a little.

539
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:37,702
MARISHA: It's going to make it so much funnier.

540
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,482
LAURA: All right, go. What is it?

541
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:47,618
LIAM: Well, there was this acid pit, right? And we
all got on top of the carpet, like we do.

542
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:52,643
LAURA: Yeah, fly over the acid pit.

543
00:40:52,643 --> 00:40:58,734
LIAM: And there were these giant magical sigils
that borked the carpet. Which was fine. It was

544
00:40:58,734 --> 00:41:01,560
fine, because the thing started to go down--

545
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,766
LAURA: Right, and then you pulled up, and you
jumped--

546
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:11,709
LIAM: I grabbed the carpet, and I jumped and put
my own body, up to my fucking head, into the acid.

547
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:20,012
Burned. Yeah, you see this? You see this little
bit of gray? I held the carpet up, and then it's

548
00:41:20,012 --> 00:41:26,386
funny. We both sank together, and then the carpet
went in the acid. But it was still okay. It wasn't

549
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:27,835
completely destroyed.

550
00:41:27,835 --> 00:41:29,815
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, you said it went in the acid?

551
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:32,747
LAURA: But then you saved it, and it was fine.

552
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:36,866
LIAM: Just a little bit, but only completely.
Tiberius--

553
00:41:36,866 --> 00:41:40,287
TALIESIN: This story will be great if we could see
the carpet, I think.

554
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:43,632
ORION: I pull it out of my Bag of Holding.

555
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:47,232
TALIESIN: Well, you cleaned it, and that's nice.

556
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:48,806
TRAVIS: It looks fine.

557
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,485
LAURA: It looks a little less... glowy, though.

558
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:53,917
ORION: It doesn't fly anymore.

559
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,892
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, it doesn't fry anymore?

560
00:41:55,892 --> 00:42:00,145
LIAM: It's very comfortable to step upon, but it
doesn't fly.

561
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:02,183
MARISHA: It's going to make a gorgeous tapestry.

562
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:04,034
ORION: We need to re-enchant it, is what's going
on.

563
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:08,257
LAURA: (shouting) You lost the carpet?!

564
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:12,506
MARISHA: We-- the carpet we stole, to be fair.

565
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:16,695
LAURA: The carpet--

566
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:23,632
ORION: It's okay. Again, it's not a big deal. We
just have to re-enchant it. I'll find somebody

567
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:25,100
powerful enough to do so.

568
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,378
LAURA: It's okay. We'll just pool our funds
together. You guys didn't spend any money during

569
00:42:30,378 --> 00:42:35,080
your mission, right? We can pool our funds
together and maybe find somebody. You didn't spend

570
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,339
any money?

571
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:37,767
ORION: No, we spent--

572
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:40,858
LIAM: We're still alive?

573
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:47,451
ORION: I have a plan, though, Vex.

574
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:58,709
TALIESIN: We slept in a tent! We slept in a tent
in the woods with the loudest librarian on god's

575
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,404
green earth!

576
00:43:00,404 --> 00:43:02,943
LAURA: You should have kissed her, Percy.

577
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:05,026
TALIESIN: She talked in her sleep!

578
00:43:05,026 --> 00:43:08,532
TRAVIS: You got a kiss! I didn't get a kiss.

579
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:12,890
MARISHA: Hey, I'd never been kissed before,
okay?!

580
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,763
LIAM: In our defense--

581
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:16,437
TRAVIS: What the fuck just happened?

582
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:18,512
MARISHA: What just happened?

583
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,313
TALIESIN: This is what happens when you de-enchant
the carpet.

584
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:24,410
MATT: At which point, there's a knock at the front
of the guild hall.

585
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,418
MARISHA: God, timing.

586
00:43:26,418 --> 00:43:29,062
LIAM: Is there a tavern anywhere nearby?

587
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:38,736
MATT: Mertin walks over. "All right. Not a
problem." Opens the door. Peeking from around the

588
00:43:38,736 --> 00:43:52,196
doorway, you see meekly a familiar female form.
Short, white hair, silver and blue armor, small in

589
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,956
stature. There stands a meek and smiling Pike.

590
00:43:55,956 --> 00:44:00,501
(cheering)

591
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:12,023
ASHLEY: Oh, hi! Hello.

592
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:15,938
TRAVIS: How did you do that? Your ways are
mysterious.

593
00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:21,414
MARISHA: How have you been? Oh my god. I think
we've only been away for a week, but it feels like

594
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:22,718
a year.

595
00:44:22,718 --> 00:44:34,150
ASHLEY: Oh, you know. Here we are. Oh boy. It's so
good to see you guys. I've been working on the

596
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:48,458
temple, and some people are great there, and some
aren't. It's been great. I'm just so glad to be

597
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:54,439
back. I got a couple of days off, so I figured I
needed to come hang out with the group.

598
00:44:54,439 --> 00:44:57,659
MARISHA: How did you find us here? How did you
know to find us here, Pike?

599
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:04,107
MATT: Here's the circumstance with you, Pike. They
reached a certain point in getting a lot of the

600
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:10,578
temple, most of it uncovered. It's still not quite
at the level you want it to be, and it'll take a

601
00:45:10,578 --> 00:45:15,919
few months to get into its full restoration.
However, there is definitely a curse placed on the

602
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:20,831
tower that was once built over the temple, which
is why most people avoided it for so long and

603
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:24,236
didn't realize there was something beneath it. The
more you guys worked, the more and more you saw

604
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:28,976
the curse was essentially undoing and corroding a
lot of the work you guys were doing to restore it.

605
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:34,974
The group had to pool their funds to hire a high
priest of the Raven Queen to come in for the next

606
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:39,783
week and cleanse the landscape of the curse that
has basically prevented you guys from progressing

607
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:42,821
in restoring the temple, so you have about a week
to yourself.

608
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:46,299
ASHLEY: I'm here for about a week.

609
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:48,706
LAURA: What should we do?

610
00:45:48,706 --> 00:45:50,434
LIAM: Let's go to Kraghammer!

611
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:52,446
LAURA: Do we have enough time?

612
00:45:52,446 --> 00:45:59,248
ORION: We have to get the money from Kraghammer,
right? Pike, by the way, did you notice any blue

613
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:00,863
shit around?

614
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:03,887
ASHLEY: Yes!

615
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:08,839
LIAM: Like holy shit.

616
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:12,451
TRAVIS: Like holy shit, did you walk around going
like, "Oh, holy shit!"

617
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:26,652
ASHLEY: We were doing a lot of dusting. You know,
you have your little brush? And I came across some

618
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:34,968
blue shit, and I was wondering what it was, so I
just kept it there. I didn't clean it.

619
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:37,489
LAURA: You didn't pick up blue shit?

620
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:41,078
ASHLEY: I just thought it was so fascinating. I
had to leave it there.

621
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:45,494
ORION: Apparently, blue shit is charmed in these
lands.

622
00:46:45,494 --> 00:46:50,263
LAURA: It's a very good blessing wherever it
lands.

623
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:58,981
ASHLEY: Well, I picked it up, and I put it aside
in a jar, just in case.

624
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,076
LAURA: I'm sure she had gloves on. You had gloves
on, right?

625
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:02,722
ASHLEY: I had gloves, just in case.

626
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:07,258
LIAM: A blessing from Sarenrae.

627
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,237
ASHLEY: That's what I thought.

628
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:14,305
LAURA: Well, what should we do?

629
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:19,463
MARISHA: Well, once again, I don't want to leave,
because I'm assuming we'll lose access. We don't

630
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:22,203
have access to the airship for forever.

631
00:47:22,203 --> 00:47:29,284
LAURA: It's true. We should probably go see your
family before we go to Kraghammer.

632
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:34,025
ORION: Well, wait a minute. Kraghammer is just
getting our money and leaving, right?

633
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:35,960
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

634
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,939
ORION: Your family, is that closer?

635
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:42,455
MARISHA: It's around the corner.

636
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:44,740
TRAVIS: Should we visit the shop and get some
potions?

637
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,336
LAURA: Oh my gosh, do we need potions.

638
00:47:47,336 --> 00:47:49,296
ORION: Yes, we need to item up.

639
00:47:49,296 --> 00:47:51,309
LAURA: Just go and buy some potions.

640
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:52,362
ORION: Yeah.

641
00:47:52,362 --> 00:47:54,013
MATT: All right.

642
00:47:54,013 --> 00:47:59,828
LAURA: Wait, does the Slayer's Take have a nice
stock of potions?

643
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:02,374
LIAM: Or an employee discount?

644
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:09,372
MATT: You inquire with Mertin, and Mertin gives a
moment of thought and goes, "To be honest, I'm

645
00:48:09,372 --> 00:48:16,437
"pretty sure that we gave our current stock to a
couple of teams throughout, including the one

646
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:18,208
"that went and fought the dragon."

647
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:23,154
LAURA: Oh, yes. Funny thing: we used them because
it was a dragon. Do you have any more?

648
00:48:23,154 --> 00:48:26,539
MATT: "At the moment, no. We have a few that are
on order. Should be here in the next two, three

649
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:31,264
"days. So there's that. But--"

650
00:48:31,264 --> 00:48:34,426
ORION: Is there a bazaar with any shops we can go
to?

651
00:48:34,426 --> 00:48:38,204
MATT: "I mean, there is the bazaar north of the
guild; you're welcome to check in that area, but

652
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:45,215
"most of our enchanted potions are exported. It's
one of the many things that the city makes its

653
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:48,864
"money on, and to be perfectly honest, most of what
you've seen throughout the world probably in some

654
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:54,756
"way, shape, or form came from us. We take a lot of
pride in that. But you're welcome to ask around.

655
00:48:54,756 --> 00:48:57,619
"Good to hear this."

656
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:02,992
ORION: As we're doing the item stuff, I would like
to stop at a blacksmith's shop.

657
00:49:02,992 --> 00:49:06,669
MARISHA: Did we want to go to a tavern, too? What
time is it?

658
00:49:06,669 --> 00:49:10,882
MATT: By the time this team has arrived, I'd say
it's close to 2:00 in the afternoon.

659
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:13,122
MARISHA: Okay, shop then tavern?

660
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:15,509
LAURA: Is Zahra still in the Slayer's Take, or has
she left?

661
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:17,351
MATT: No, Zahra has left already.

662
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:20,367
LAURA: You guys really needed to meet her.
Tiberius, you would've liked her a lot.

663
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:21,621
TRAVIS: She had a tail.

664
00:49:21,621 --> 00:49:23,855
LAURA: She was red.

665
00:49:23,855 --> 00:49:30,363
ORION: I love tails. Ooh, and that's my favorite
color. What magic did she--

666
00:49:30,363 --> 00:49:32,916
LAURA: Very powerful magic.

667
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,777
TRAVIS: Moonbeam staff.

668
00:49:35,777 --> 00:49:38,479
ORION: A warlock. Interesting.

669
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,859
TALIESIN: Yes. Quite charming.

670
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:43,876
TRAVIS: She had horns. And teeth.

671
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:47,686
LAURA: And eyes. Let's go buy some potions.

672
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:49,111
ORION: Let's do.

673
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,026
ASHLEY: Where did you guys get these cookies?

674
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:54,219
LIAM: Ask Merkin. He can tell you.

675
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:55,708
ASHLEY: Merkin?

676
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:57,032
LAURA: This guy.

677
00:49:57,032 --> 00:49:58,108
ASHLEY: Oh, hi!

678
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:00,803
MATT: The halfling who's now standing there-- the
one who let you in that you didn't pay much

679
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:03,394
attention to because you were more focused on
seeing your friends.

680
00:50:03,394 --> 00:50:05,179
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I'm so rude. I'm Pike!

681
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:09,808
MATT: "Pike, it's a pleasure to meet you. The
name's Mertin."

682
00:50:09,808 --> 00:50:11,098
ASHLEY: Mertin?

683
00:50:11,098 --> 00:50:12,308
MATT: "With a T."

684
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:13,366
TRAVIS: Merkin.

685
00:50:13,366 --> 00:50:16,070
LAURA and ASHLEY: Merktin.

686
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,452
MATT: "I can take these cookies back."

687
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:19,608
LAURA: No, please.

688
00:50:19,608 --> 00:50:25,449
MATT: "But these cookies have been provided by a
friend of the guild. If you're a friend of them,

689
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:27,553
"you're a friend of the guild."

690
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:29,543
LAURA: Yay.

691
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:34,242
LIAM: Look at these badass tattoos! Yeah, look at
that.

692
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:40,347
ASHLEY: What is it?

693
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:44,763
TRAVIS: It's a brand that we got from a giant
sphincter.

694
00:50:44,763 --> 00:50:47,332
ORION: No, sphinx. Sphinx.

695
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:48,726
TRAVIS: Sphinx?

696
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:55,426
ORION: A sphincter is your butthole. Not who we
fight, but when you go--

697
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:57,373
TRAVIS: Boom-boom.

698
00:50:57,373 --> 00:51:00,315
LAURA: What should we do? You go find a blacksmith
and we get some potions?

699
00:51:00,315 --> 00:51:06,651
LIAM: Welcome to the Critical Role comedy hour,
folks. Make sure you hit the two-drink minimum

700
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:08,074
before you leave.

701
00:51:08,074 --> 00:51:13,521
LAURA: Do you think maybe that you could maybe
start out on a journey with us, and then head back

702
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:15,364
if you need to get back to the temple?

703
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:23,240
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have some time. I think we should
just hang out like old times just for a little

704
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,064
bit.

705
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:25,125
ORION: Yes!

706
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,522
LIAM: Keyleth will fly you back lickety-split,
just like that, yeah.

707
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:29,744
ASHLEY: Should we take the carpet?

708
00:51:29,744 --> 00:51:30,973
LIAM: Oh.

709
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:33,094
TRAVIS: Right. About that.

710
00:51:33,094 --> 00:51:37,966
LIAM: Vex broke the carpet.

711
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:41,646
LAURA: (gasps) I did not!

712
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:45,763
ASHLEY: She would never do such a thing. She
wouldn't do it. You're lying.

713
00:51:45,763 --> 00:51:47,208
LIAM: I tried to save it.

714
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:48,866
ASHLEY: Is it now just a rug?

715
00:51:48,866 --> 00:51:50,954
MARISHA: It's now just a very pretty rug.

716
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:54,708
LAURA: Oh, Pike. Do you want to keep it at the
temple?

717
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:58,935
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to get it
re-enchanted.

718
00:51:58,935 --> 00:52:00,588
ASHLEY: You'll get it re-enchanted.

719
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:06,367
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure it's a very expensive
enchantment.

720
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:10,335
ASHLEY: I wonder if I could re-enchant it with the
poo.

721
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,234
LAURA: Just rub poo all over it?

722
00:52:13,234 --> 00:52:15,171
ASHLEY: I don't know what it is!

723
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:25,284
ORION: Actually, Pike, now that you mention it,
perhaps you could ask some divine blessing from

724
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:30,457
Sarenrae. Make it a holy carpet instead.

725
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:32,417
LAURA: Ooh!

726
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,207
TRAVIS: You have been working in a temple.

727
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:37,819
LAURA: It's true, you have some sort of thing
where you do it with a spell where you can ask her

728
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:39,106
to help us?

729
00:52:39,106 --> 00:52:42,230
MARISHA: You have a ten percent chance of
succeeding, but it's awesome when it happens?

730
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,950
LAURA: You should do it!

731
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,178
MATT: Up to you.

732
00:52:45,178 --> 00:52:47,203
ASHLEY: Yes, why not?

733
00:52:47,203 --> 00:52:49,260
MARISHA: Yes, we take the carpet out.

734
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,305
LAURA: Come on, Sarenrae.

735
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:57,683
ASHLEY: Okay. I don't have any dice.

736
00:52:57,683 --> 00:53:00,209
LAURA: Oh, look! Look at all these.

737
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:06,311
MATT: So if you're wishing to use your Divine
Intervention, you roll two d10s, the percentile

738
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:10,122
dice. Usually, you have one that has two digits
and one that has one digit. Roll those together,

739
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:14,639
and you're trying to roll under your level, so
you're trying to roll an 11 or lower.

740
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,612
LAURA: Combined of the two?

741
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:20,232
TRAVIS: Roll one at a time.

742
00:53:20,232 --> 00:53:22,906
MATT: Yeah, the first one is--

743
00:53:22,906 --> 00:53:24,248
LIAM: Six.

744
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:28,072
MATT: So that'd be a 60. Yeah. So as you roll out
the carpet, you take a moment to hold on to your

745
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:35,167
holy symbol. You sense that Sarenrae's there, but
divine magic versus the initial arcane-based

746
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:38,979
enchantment here? It's a little out of her realm
and her focus is scattered at the moment.

747
00:53:38,979 --> 00:53:44,456
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. I'm just a little too excited
to do this right now.

748
00:53:44,456 --> 00:53:46,294
ORION: You were coming from work--

749
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:49,975
ASHLEY: Yeah, coming from work. Tired, the time
change.

750
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:52,128
MARISHA: I'm sure you're doing a lot with
Sarenrae.

751
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,491
ASHLEY: We'll try it again later, maybe.

752
00:53:54,491 --> 00:53:57,244
TRAVIS: Should we go get some potions so we can
heal up?

753
00:53:57,244 --> 00:53:58,889
MATT: You can attempt it once a day.

754
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:03,261
LAURA: Oh, good. We can try it every day while
you're with us for a week. That's seven times!

755
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:06,505
MATT: You don't quite know how the Divine
Intervention's going to work, but you know that

756
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:08,475
she may come and help you in some way.

757
00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:10,017
ASHLEY: Okay.

758
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:15,094
LIAM: So what are we doing? We're going to go
shopping for potions, and then we're going to go

759
00:54:15,094 --> 00:54:16,916
see Kiki's family, yeah?

760
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:20,898
LAURA: Kiki? Is that what you called her when she
was your wife?

761
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:24,959
TRAVIS: What time is it, did we say?

762
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:27,056
MATT: About 2:00 in the afternoon now.

763
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:28,655
TRAVIS: No beard check.

764
00:54:28,655 --> 00:54:30,302
LAURA: Try it!

765
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:31,781
TRAVIS: I can't. It's not a new day.

766
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:33,495
MATT: Well, it took you a few days of travel.

767
00:54:33,495 --> 00:54:34,882
TRAVIS: It's a new day!

768
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:36,727
ASHLEY: Is there a little scruff there?

769
00:54:36,727 --> 00:54:39,867
LAURA: It's like fishing wire.

770
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:43,533
LIAM: You can't see it, but if you rub your hand
on his chin, you can feel it a little bit.

771
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:44,935
TRAVIS: 96.

772
00:54:44,935 --> 00:54:50,980
MATT: There's no additional growth. One actually
goes ping! And it shoots off.

773
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,877
(laughter)

774
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:55,776
ASHLEY: I caught it!

775
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:58,779
TRAVIS: (gasps)

776
00:54:58,779 --> 00:55:00,635
ASHLEY: No, don't blow it away!

777
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:01,979
LIAM: Make a wish.

778
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:04,231
LAURA: No, keep it, Pike! It'll be with you
always.

779
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:06,331
LIAM: Wish on the carpet-- oh.

780
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:10,146
TRAVIS: That's going in her Sarenrae. You watch
it, motherfucker.

781
00:55:10,146 --> 00:55:17,357
MATT: All right. As you guys step out into the
thoroughfare of the Quadroads, it is beginning to

782
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:22,458
rain a little bit, and you can already hear people
moving through the city. You make your way towards

783
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:29,100
the central portion of the Quadroads, where the
large bazaar is set up. There are a number of

784
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,164
tents and small shacks set up. Some are temporary
and move in and out, but everyone seems to have

785
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:39,781
their various tarps up and things to help protect,
overhangs, from any prospect of customers from

786
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:43,093
getting rained on too heavily. However, the floor
of this city, which is already pretty dusty and

787
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:48,490
dirty in its own right, has now become sludge-like
mud, and there's this constant (squelching) as

788
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:54,316
you're walking through the city. It's easy enough
for you, Tiberius, to go ahead and find a

789
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:59,115
blacksmith. Generally, there aren't too many in
this area. A lot of those tend to be pushed up

790
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:03,295
more towards the Braving Grounds, so it's easy to
find the one or two plumes of black smoke--

791
00:56:03,295 --> 00:56:06,415
TALIESIN: I could send him to the blacksmith I
went to.

792
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:13,784
ORION: Along the way, I would also like to be
looking out for any animal shopkeeps.

793
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:15,167
MATT: Animal?

794
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,940
TALIESIN: A pet store?

795
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,100
MATT: Okay. All right. Make a perception check.

796
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:28,155
ORION: Sorry.

797
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:32,696
LIAM: Are you shopping for a little buddy?

798
00:56:32,696 --> 00:56:36,673
ORION: I am. That is nine.

799
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:40,013
MATT: So as you're walking along, nothing's really
catching your eye. You do manage to go to the

800
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:43,269
blacksmith that Percy sent you to. What are you
seeking in particular?

801
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:50,845
ORION: A dragonite, raven.

802
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:53,197
TALIESIN: At the blacksmith's?

803
00:56:53,197 --> 00:57:06,467
ORION: The blacksmith's? Oh. I think I can only do
short swords and looking at a crossbow.

804
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:08,721
LIAM: You know how to use a blade, Tiberius?

805
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:15,376
ORION: I do. Oh, quarterstaff. I think that's what
I'm proficient in. So I'm going to, crossbow,

806
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:17,141
quarterstaff, some darts.

807
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:23,562
MATT: Okay. Blacksmithing is more for
construction. The blacksmith there says, "Well, I

808
00:57:23,562 --> 00:57:29,490
"mean, I can certainly make some for you, but
there's already plenty of ready-made ones over at the

809
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,024
"general store across the way." And he points to a
smaller building.

810
00:57:32,024 --> 00:57:36,737
ORION: I would like a quarterstaff, though, with
bladed ends. It is why I came to you, sir.

811
00:57:36,737 --> 00:57:47,302
MATT: "All right." And the scruffy-chinned human
rubs his half-beard and thinks it over. "I can

812
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:51,253
"probably fashion something. I can't tell you how
wieldy it'll be, but we can certainly try. Give me

813
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:57,696
"about-- four hours, probably, with a ready-made
quarterstaff?"

814
00:57:57,696 --> 00:57:59,305
ORION: Wonderful.

815
00:57:59,305 --> 00:58:06,141
MATT: "All right. For the custom, put you back
about, say, 80 gold for the custom job."

816
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:07,799
ORION: Wonderful.

817
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:10,166
MATT: "You wanted a crossbow, you said. You want a
heavy crossbow or--"

818
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:16,119
ORION: Oh. What do you prefer? I'm a sorcerer, so
I've got to keep it light.

819
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:20,061
MATT: "Then you're probably going to go with a
regular hand-crossbow. Go talk to that general

820
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:28,388
"store over there." And he sends you across the
way. You head over to the general store. You

821
00:58:28,388 --> 00:58:34,445
purchase, base price for a hand-crossbow is 75
gold pieces, so mark that off.

822
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:36,656
LIAM: I'm walking over just to watch.

823
00:58:36,656 --> 00:58:41,395
MATT: All right. A short sword is easy enough to
purchase, that is ten gold pieces.

824
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:42,801
ORION: Cool.

825
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:46,512
LIAM: You got a taste for the knocking-about,
fighting that thing, didn't you?

826
00:58:46,512 --> 00:58:50,302
ORION: I don't like being unarmed anymore. And
darts.

827
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:53,984
MATT: You also have to manage to get your
ammunition, as well.

828
00:58:53,984 --> 00:58:58,785
ORION: Yeah, I need bolts. Bolts.

829
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:07,302
LAURA: If you buy a lot, you can put them in your
Bag of Holding. That's what I do. Speaking of,

830
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:09,494
how's my supply in there? Is it pretty good,
still?

831
00:59:09,494 --> 00:59:10,900
TRAVIS: Your supply of what?

832
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,459
LAURA: My arrows in the Bag of Holding.

833
00:59:12,459 --> 00:59:15,084
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, they're all over the fucking
place.

834
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,802
ORION: How much for 40 bolts?

835
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:28,885
MATT: 40 bolts, I'd say I put those-- I'd say for
40, two gold. Bolts aren't too expensive. It's

836
00:59:28,885 --> 00:59:30,395
bulk bin.

837
00:59:30,395 --> 00:59:33,641
ORION: Okay, then a hundred.

838
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:36,796
MATT: There are only currently 80 available.

839
00:59:36,796 --> 00:59:38,525
ORION: I'll buy the whole lot.

840
00:59:38,525 --> 00:59:40,365
LIAM: I bought them for you.

841
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:45,623
LAURA: While they're shopping, I just want to
drill Keyleth a little more about her smooch that

842
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,921
she got.

843
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:49,936
LIAM: That's more interesting than the bolts.

844
00:59:49,936 --> 00:59:54,915
LAURA: So wait, he kissed you or you kissed him?

845
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:56,728
MARISHA: No, he kissed me.

846
00:59:56,728 --> 00:59:57,967
LAURA: He kissed you.

847
00:59:57,967 --> 00:59:59,595
ASHLEY: You were kissed?

848
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:01,122
LAURA: A cleric kissed her!

849
01:00:01,122 --> 01:00:02,199
ASHLEY: (gasps)

850
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:05,010
LAURA: Do you know who his deity was? Maybe Pike
knows him!

851
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:11,212
MARISHA: Oh, his name was Kashaw. Brother Kashaw.
He was a cleric. But he wasn't a cleric to

852
01:00:11,212 --> 01:00:18,335
Sarenrae, he was actually a cleric to this demon
goddess named Vesh.

853
01:00:18,335 --> 01:00:19,827
ASHLEY: Oh!

854
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:21,207
MATT: You've never heard of Vesh.

855
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:22,876
ASHLEY: I don't know who that is.

856
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:25,072
(laughter)

857
01:00:25,072 --> 01:00:29,676
ASHLEY: I thought I did for two seconds, and then
I was like, oh wait, no I don't.

858
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:32,288
MARISHA: It was interesting.

859
01:00:32,288 --> 01:00:34,660
TRAVIS: Does Vesh have a lot of followers?

860
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,165
TALIESIN: It's an old god; you've probably never
heard of it.

861
01:00:37,165 --> 01:00:39,286
ASHLEY: That's what I was thinking.

862
01:00:39,286 --> 01:00:43,685
MARISHA: Yes, no, apparently he's the only one.
He's also married to her?

863
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:56,097
LAURA: And he kissed you? Wait. A guy that's
married to a god kissed you.

864
01:00:56,097 --> 01:00:59,446
TALIESIN: Oh, I see how this could work out
poorly.

865
01:00:59,446 --> 01:01:01,465
ASHLEY: What if she gets mad?

866
01:01:01,465 --> 01:01:08,471
MARISHA: I've thought about that a little bit, and
then tried not to think about that a lot.

867
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:13,067
LIAM: Tell her to get in line.

868
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:15,174
TRAVIS: I don't like that face.

869
01:01:15,174 --> 01:01:17,592
MATT: What? I'm just enjoying some water.

870
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:20,399
LAURA: I shouldn't have even said anything.

871
01:01:20,399 --> 01:01:23,877
MARISHA: It was awesome, though. Then he just
walked off into the sunset.

872
01:01:23,877 --> 01:01:29,820
LAURA: Was it good? It was a good kiss?

873
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:34,937
MARISHA: (whispers) I've never been kissed before,
so I don't know. It was really good. Made me

874
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:36,767
tingly inside.

875
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:39,247
ASHLEY: Oh, that's a great feeling.

876
01:01:39,247 --> 01:01:43,424
MARISHA: Yeah. Very nice.

877
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:45,728
MATT: So while this is happening--

878
01:01:45,728 --> 01:01:49,122
MARISHA: He's not listening. We're girl pow-wowing
right now.

879
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,003
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Girl time.

880
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:54,057
TALIESIN: We're shopping for potions.

881
01:01:54,057 --> 01:02:03,642
LIAM: What else do you need? It's all on me. If
you hadn't stopped that shithead from leaving, I

882
01:02:03,642 --> 01:02:07,122
wouldn't have put a dagger in the back of his
head, and we would've been looking over our

883
01:02:07,122 --> 01:02:13,009
shoulders for who knows how long, so everything's
on me. Whatever you want, tell me. Not a carpet. I

884
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:14,379
can't afford it.

885
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:18,084
MATT: There's no real potion shops. The
construction of potions is not a ready thing.

886
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:23,329
People don't manufacture them left and right; it's
a time-consuming process, and a lot of them are

887
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:26,296
exported, so finding them here is a little
difficult, and they're usually part of other

888
01:02:26,296 --> 01:02:31,751
stores that sell it as part of their stock. You
guys, before you journeyed out last time, cleaned

889
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:35,491
out the hag.

890
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:41,641
MARISHA: Oh, that's something else we have to tell
you guys about!

891
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:46,571
TRAVIS: Can I look around the street and see if
there are any shady types lurking about.

892
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:50,107
MATT: Make an investigation check. Asking and
looking around, no one seems particularly

893
01:02:50,107 --> 01:02:50,950
helpful.

894
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:55,503
TALIESIN: Excuse me. I'm looking for potions. Can
I get some service?

895
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:57,845
MATT: Some individuals push you aside.

896
01:02:57,845 --> 01:03:05,292
MARISHA: I pull Percy aside. No, remember this
town? They don't like magic and stuff and they get

897
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:14,842
weird about potions. And all the-- what are they
called? The Bastions all control the trade of

898
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:18,295
potions, so people get weird. It's weird and
illegal.

899
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:27,854
MATT: Grog, you come up to a gentleman. He's
dressed in a fine velvet bright-red-and-maroon

900
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:32,422
tunic, and he's carrying a small satchel at his
side, and he's standing outside of a small tent

901
01:03:32,422 --> 01:03:37,885
and he's like, "Anyone? Come forth! I carry
oddities of all kinds! If you wish to see what I

902
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:44,544
"have for sale, I'll be happy to sell them!" Turns
and sees you. "Oh. You, sir! You look like you're

903
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:46,865
"in an inquiring mood."

904
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,711
TRAVIS: What'd you call me?

905
01:03:48,711 --> 01:03:53,857
MATT: "Sir. It's a respectful term."

906
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:55,978
TRAVIS: What were you saying?

907
01:03:55,978 --> 01:03:59,541
MATT: "I should probably go."

908
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:02,474
TRAVIS: No, wait, you said you have oddities.

909
01:04:02,474 --> 01:04:07,443
MATT: "Yes. Strange things from around the lands.
I have them sent in from all over the

910
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,490
"continents."

911
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,247
TRAVIS: Go on, then. Like what?

912
01:04:10,247 --> 01:04:14,842
MATT: "Like--" And he reaches into his pouch and
pulls out this small jar that contains a liquid,

913
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:20,400
and you can see something sort of floating in this
liquid. It's a little bit cloudy. "This is the eye

914
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,671
"of a basilisk I procured from the distant north of
Tal'Dorei."

915
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:26,365
TALIESIN: We've already got one.

916
01:04:26,365 --> 01:04:27,832
TRAVIS: I think we have two.

917
01:04:27,832 --> 01:04:32,099
MATT: "Well, then. What are you looking for?"

918
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:37,926
TRAVIS: Funny thing. I like to work out a lot, and
I like to go lift boulders in the forest

919
01:04:37,926 --> 01:04:42,819
sometimes, so would you have anything that might
give me a temporary increase to my already

920
01:04:42,819 --> 01:04:44,595
magnificent strength?

921
01:04:44,595 --> 01:04:49,318
MATT: "Let me see." And he rummages through this
small tent on the side. You see it's more of a

922
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:55,518
storage tent-slash-bedroom-slash-whatever it takes
to set up shop really quickly. This guy's

923
01:04:55,518 --> 01:04:57,089
definitely a traveling solo merchant.

924
01:04:57,089 --> 01:04:58,739
TRAVIS: Like the dude in the beginning of
Aladdin?

925
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:00,235
MATT: A little bit.

926
01:05:00,235 --> 01:05:02,565
TRAVIS: Come close. Oh, too close! A little too
close.

927
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,335
(laughter)

928
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:14,641
MATT: That, with a little more of a fake
upper-crust, Renaissance-man visualization. He

929
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:18,980
reaches back. You hear him rummaging through some
glassware and he goes, "I actually have a few

930
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:25,129
"potions at my disposal here." He dips under one of
the nearby tents that has an overhang, to get out

931
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,275
of the rain.

932
01:05:26,275 --> 01:05:27,981
LAURA: Can we hear this at all?

933
01:05:27,981 --> 01:05:30,164
MATT: You guys are having girl talk right now.
This is a little ways out of the way.

934
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:32,150
LIAM: Welcome to Agrabah.

935
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:39,374
MATT: "I happen to have one such potion. In fact,
I have on good authority, it will restore some of

936
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:44,048
"your own damaged internal, should you find
yourself in a dangerous situation."

937
01:05:44,048 --> 01:05:52,845
TRAVIS: I like the scars that my damage situations
leave behind. I'm not quite as interested in that.

938
01:05:52,845 --> 01:05:54,274
What else have you got?

939
01:05:54,274 --> 01:05:55,538
MATT: "All right."

940
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:57,159
TALIESIN: (stutters)

941
01:05:57,159 --> 01:06:01,030
MATT: You guys are off shopping elsewhere. You
guys are probably together, though.

942
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,485
TALIESIN: How much was that?

943
01:06:04,485 --> 01:06:09,113
MATT: "This one would run you 500 gold pieces."

944
01:06:09,113 --> 01:06:11,271
TALIESIN: Is it a superior healing potion?

945
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:13,513
MATT: No, this one is a greater.

946
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:16,000
TALIESIN: I'm not spending 500 gold on a greater
healing potion.

947
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,004
TRAVIS: Come on, pull a Vex. Get that number
down.

948
01:06:18,004 --> 01:06:28,111
MATT: "Very well. For you, sir, I perhaps have
this." He pulls out a vial that has a gray,

949
01:06:28,111 --> 01:06:34,448
sparkling, almost like it has an iron filing
sediment inside this thick, syrupy liquid. It

950
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,804
looks like it would taste awful.

951
01:06:36,804 --> 01:06:38,414
TRAVIS: Ironschlager.

952
01:06:38,414 --> 01:06:41,252
MATT: (laughs) Yes. Yes, it is.

953
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:42,603
TALIESIN: Why do they not make that?

954
01:06:42,603 --> 01:06:44,929
TRAVIS: Because they'd put a lot of iron in it.

955
01:06:44,929 --> 01:06:46,531
TALIESIN: Some people need iron.

956
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:47,968
TRAVIS: That's true.

957
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:56,125
MATT: "This, I've been told, has been crafted from
and distilled from the blood of many a tyrant-like

958
01:06:56,125 --> 01:07:02,771
"stone giant from the far off mountains of the
hinterlands. This, when swallowed, should imbue

959
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:05,563
"you with the strength of a thousand men."

960
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:10,769
TRAVIS: A thousand? That's just above, like,
four?

961
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:14,210
MATT: "Sort of."

962
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:15,795
TRAVIS: How much?

963
01:07:15,795 --> 01:07:23,821
MATT: "For this one? This, I'd say, would run you
a simple 6,000 gold pieces."

964
01:07:23,821 --> 01:07:25,526
ASHLEY: Whoa.

965
01:07:25,526 --> 01:07:35,446
TRAVIS: Not that I'm not a man of incredible
wealth. Would you be interested in anything

966
01:07:35,446 --> 01:07:38,546
besides coin?

967
01:07:38,546 --> 01:07:43,559
MATT: "Speaking of which do you offer?"

968
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:54,294
TRAVIS: Well, I have this fancy bag myself. I
happen to have parts of an umber hulk. Pieces of

969
01:07:54,294 --> 01:08:01,970
dragon, if you might be interested in that. I also
have jewels and fancy robes, if you need a

970
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,580
change.

971
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,157
MATT: "My robes are quite fancy enough, but thank
you."

972
01:08:06,157 --> 01:08:10,603
TRAVIS: Right. I have an orc head. And I reach
into the Bag of Holding and pull out the orc

973
01:08:10,603 --> 01:08:11,620
head.

974
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:25,146
MATT: "Put that away. Please. No, it's spraying on
the front of my vest." Make a perception roll...

975
01:08:25,146 --> 01:08:36,799
No, I'm sorry, not perception, persuasion.
Persuasion.

976
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:42,979
TRAVIS: Oh, that's actually plus one for
persuasion. 13.

977
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:51,123
MATT: 13? All right. He goes, "Pieces of dragon,
you say?"

978
01:08:51,123 --> 01:08:55,386
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do. We have 14 dragon teeth.

979
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:58,418
LAURA: Don't tell him all the numbers.

980
01:08:58,418 --> 01:09:04,554
TRAVIS: You're not there. Four cups of blood. It's
probably more like a gel right now. Several pounds

981
01:09:04,554 --> 01:09:08,281
of scales, and maybe a few claws. I'd have to
look; there's so many.

982
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:18,545
MATT: "How about this? For direct trade, no coin
exchange necessary: all 14 of your dragon's teeth,

983
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:23,276
and perhaps two of those blood vials."

984
01:09:23,276 --> 01:09:30,446
TALIESIN: (whispering) What would Vex do?

985
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:33,965
TRAVIS: How about--

986
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:36,744
TALIESIN: (whispering) Thank you.

987
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:41,426
TRAVIS: All of the dragon's teeth and three of the
vials of blood?

988
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:42,887
MARISHA: What?!

989
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,107
TALIESIN: Ugh!

990
01:09:44,107 --> 01:09:45,305
TRAVIS: Done.

991
01:09:45,305 --> 01:09:46,612
TALIESIN: Ugh!

992
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:51,992
MATT: He accepts all of the dragon's teeth, three
of the four vials of blood-- you can mark those

993
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:53,703
off the Bag of Holding.

994
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:56,061
LAURA: (laughter) You're such a dick!

995
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:58,647
TALIESIN: We're getting you a leash!

996
01:09:58,647 --> 01:10:01,775
TRAVIS: Vex will be so proud of me.

997
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:08,884
(laughter)

998
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:12,728
TRAVIS: Goodbye.

999
01:10:12,728 --> 01:10:17,690
MATT: All gone, but you currently now have in your
possession one Potion of Stone Giant Strength.

1000
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:20,916
TRAVIS: Stone Giant Strength. Thank you.

1001
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,838
LIAM: You drive a hard bargain.

1002
01:10:22,838 --> 01:10:24,332
TRAVIS: Can I find that in here?

1003
01:10:24,332 --> 01:10:31,344
MATT: No. When imbibed you essentially, your
strength becomes equivalent to 23.

1004
01:10:31,344 --> 01:10:34,871
LIAM: One time. One big time.

1005
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:38,046
LAURA: One use, or is it multiple?

1006
01:10:38,046 --> 01:10:39,397
MATT: One hour.

1007
01:10:39,397 --> 01:10:41,029
TRAVIS: One hour, so my strength becomes 23.

1008
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,670
LAURA: Can he get multiple drinks out of it?

1009
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,264
MATT: No, it's one use.

1010
01:10:44,264 --> 01:10:46,086
ASHLEY: What happens if I were to just pinky in?

1011
01:10:46,086 --> 01:10:47,961
TRAVIS: Give it a little number?

1012
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:49,837
ASHLEY: Give it a little taste.

1013
01:10:49,837 --> 01:10:52,088
MATT: Your gums will get a little tingly for a
while. Probably be a little hyper.

1014
01:10:52,088 --> 01:10:55,525
ASHLEY: Would there be any result?

1015
01:10:55,525 --> 01:10:57,891
MATT: I don't know, do you want to try?

1016
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:00,660
ASHLEY: I'm going to wait and try it.

1017
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,739
TRAVIS: Does that change my modifier at all? When
it goes up that much?

1018
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:11,478
MATT: Oh yeah. Your modifier would become plus six
is what it would be, a plus six modifier.

1019
01:11:11,478 --> 01:11:13,196
TRAVIS: Cool.

1020
01:11:13,196 --> 01:11:14,657
LIAM: Money well spent.

1021
01:11:14,657 --> 01:11:19,996
MATT: As you take it and you shake it around, you
can see on the inside of that sparkling metallic--

1022
01:11:19,996 --> 01:11:24,261
there's a small object floating around and looking
inside, it looks like it's a clipping of a

1023
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:30,727
fingernail or a toenail of whatever giant the
potion was brewed from. Like a tequila bottle

1024
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:31,517
worm.

1025
01:11:31,517 --> 01:11:32,893
TRAVIS: That's the part everybody wants.

1026
01:11:32,893 --> 01:11:34,664
TALIESIN: So I've just been sitting here watching
this, shocked?

1027
01:11:34,664 --> 01:11:36,172
MATT: Yes.

1028
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:44,311
TRAVIS: Look what I got. Let's go join the
others.

1029
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:48,348
MATT: "Thank you for your patronage. Enjoy the
rest of your stay here in Vasselheim I hope to do

1030
01:11:48,348 --> 01:11:52,577
"business with you again in the near future." He
turns around and closes the thing. He takes his

1031
01:11:52,577 --> 01:11:55,579
satchel and he starts closing down his tent and
putting things away.

1032
01:11:55,579 --> 01:12:00,449
LAURA: Wait, you fucking-- track him down.

1033
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,063
LIAM: You've got no idea.

1034
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:03,585
MATT: Closes everything down.

1035
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:07,006
LAURA: Do we see him? Are we walking up? Can we
walk up as it's happening?

1036
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:15,359
TRAVIS: As she walks up, I grab Vex and I go, you
will be so proud. I just haggled down this guy so

1037
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,390
well.

1038
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:17,964
LAURA: What guy?

1039
01:12:17,964 --> 01:12:21,495
MATT: As you point back and look, you can see now
a cart is being wheeled away.

1040
01:12:21,495 --> 01:12:23,369
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him!

1041
01:12:23,369 --> 01:12:27,358
MATT: (laughs) Okay!

1042
01:12:27,358 --> 01:12:29,952
TRAVIS: Why? Why would you Hunter's Mark him?

1043
01:12:29,952 --> 01:12:31,332
MATT: What level?

1044
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:32,790
LAURA: What level what?

1045
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:34,216
MATT: What level Hunter's Mark? Basic level?

1046
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:38,568
TRAVIS: We are in the middle of a city where
people might not take unwarranted aggression

1047
01:12:38,568 --> 01:12:39,752
well.

1048
01:12:39,752 --> 01:12:41,856
LAURA: Level-3 Hunter's Mark.

1049
01:12:41,856 --> 01:12:48,874
MATT: He stops in his tracks and feels the rain
that's falling in his palm now; it's soaking him a

1050
01:12:48,874 --> 01:12:53,199
little bit. He has a bit of cloth over his head.
He puts his hand out and feels the rain for a

1051
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:57,936
strange temperature change, and continues pushing
the cart, pushes it through the mud, rolling up

1052
01:12:57,936 --> 01:13:01,726
the rest of the thoroughfare and disappears into
the city. But you have a pretty good idea of where

1053
01:13:01,726 --> 01:13:03,032
he's going.

1054
01:13:03,032 --> 01:13:06,535
TRAVIS: So anyway, I was working with him, and you
always try and get more for our money, (haltingly)

1055
01:13:06,535 --> 01:13:13,980
and I definitely got more for our-- more-- gave
more money--

1056
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:23,599
LAURA: What did you do? See? I'm glad I Hunter's
Marked him. What did you trade? What did you get?

1057
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:29,393
TRAVIS: Oh, I gave him tiny bits of dragon for
this amazing flask of Stone Giant Strength.

1058
01:13:29,393 --> 01:13:32,112
LAURA: What is wrong with all of you?!

1059
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:40,452
TALIESIN: I was upset about the carpet, and I
wasn't-- he's huge! What was I going to say?

1060
01:13:40,452 --> 01:13:44,480
TRAVIS: Yeah, Percy got a vial of Greater
Healing.

1061
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,961
TALIESIN: No, I didn't. It was expensive and-- oh
god.

1062
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:50,994
LAURA: I need a drink.

1063
01:13:50,994 --> 01:13:53,654
TRAVIS: To the tavern?

1064
01:13:53,654 --> 01:13:55,716
TALIESIN and MARISHA: To the tavern.

1065
01:13:55,716 --> 01:14:01,465
MATT: You guys eventually catch up. You acquire
your staff over the next few hours or so as people

1066
01:14:01,465 --> 01:14:06,257
are resting, having drinks and such. It acts as a
regular quarterstaff, except you can choose

1067
01:14:06,257 --> 01:14:08,628
whether you want it to do bludgeoning or slashing
damage.

1068
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:10,104
ORION: Okay, cool.

1069
01:14:10,104 --> 01:14:14,767
LIAM: I fall in step next to Vex and look at her
for a second. What's burning your arse?

1070
01:14:14,767 --> 01:14:20,816
LAURA: Everybody's breaking things, everybody's
spending all our money.

1071
01:14:20,816 --> 01:14:24,844
ORION: We have 30,000 gold pieces waiting for us.

1072
01:14:24,844 --> 01:14:26,732
LAURA: We don't have it now.

1073
01:14:26,732 --> 01:14:29,427
ASHLEY: 30,000 gold pieces from where?

1074
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:31,663
ORION: From when we were in Kraghammer.

1075
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:34,092
ASHLEY: Oh, you didn't collect them yet.

1076
01:14:34,092 --> 01:14:36,723
TALIESIN: So it's credit, there's credit.

1077
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:40,684
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's just waiting for us. I mean,
we're basically the richest people ever.

1078
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:43,388
LIAM: We still have a keep.

1079
01:14:43,388 --> 01:14:51,487
LAURA: We do, we have a keep! We have a beautiful
keep, with furniture, and servants.

1080
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:57,018
MATT: As soon as you say servants, the barmaid
who's coming over and filling up your drink goes,

1081
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:59,356
"We prefer barmaid, but thank you."

1082
01:14:59,356 --> 01:15:06,651
TRAVIS: Oh, excuse me! Oh, can we have a goblet of
your strongest stank for this one?

1083
01:15:06,651 --> 01:15:08,932
MATT: She looks over at her.

1084
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:12,774
LIAM: She started before we got here. Just keep it
coming. Thank you.

1085
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:14,310
MATT: "All right, all right."

1086
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:16,024
TRAVIS: How much are they?

1087
01:15:16,024 --> 01:15:19,669
MATT: "For your strongest? Per glass, I'll put
that at about--"

1088
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:22,006
LAURA: Don't tell him the price of anything.

1089
01:15:22,006 --> 01:15:24,071
MATT: "Very well."

1090
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:30,162
LIAM: I lift up the cup and keep putting it in,
and say, a round of the strongest on me. I've got

1091
01:15:30,162 --> 01:15:31,568
that, as well.

1092
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,338
ORION: I'll take a water.

1093
01:15:33,338 --> 01:15:41,382
MATT: All right. You get water, you all managed to
get your drinks. A very, very thick, syrupy

1094
01:15:41,382 --> 01:15:51,155
mead-type alcohol. Altogether for those drinks,
Vax, it comes down to 15 gold for alcohol, which

1095
01:15:51,155 --> 01:15:53,642
is expensive for a round. This is very fine.

1096
01:15:53,642 --> 01:15:57,320
TRAVIS: Should've let me haggle that down. I would
have got it to 19 gold.

1097
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:04,049
MARISHA: Hey, you're thinking about it the wrong
way, Grog. It's the other way. You want to go

1098
01:16:04,049 --> 01:16:05,186
down, not up.

1099
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,027
LAURA: I love you, guys.

1100
01:16:07,027 --> 01:16:08,789
MARISHA, ORION, and ASHLEY: I love you, too.

1101
01:16:08,789 --> 01:16:11,010
MARISHA: I missed you all so much.

1102
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:18,459
ORION: Pike, if we're to just be roundabout and
mill about today, is that what you wish, Pike?

1103
01:16:18,459 --> 01:16:22,568
After our tavern? What would you care to do?

1104
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:24,210
MARISHA: Stay-cation.

1105
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:26,819
ASHLEY: Well, wait. Where's Scanlan?

1106
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:31,308
MARISHA: He went to the park.

1107
01:16:31,308 --> 01:16:36,463
LIAM: You know, he needed a little-- it was really
rough going, from what I hear anyway, and he

1108
01:16:36,463 --> 01:16:38,927
needed a little therapy?

1109
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,994
ASHLEY: Oh, he needed a massage?

1110
01:16:40,994 --> 01:16:43,540
TRAVIS: I thought he was going to the house where
they--

1111
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,155
ORION: Lady favors.

1112
01:16:45,155 --> 01:16:46,807
ASHLEY: I get it.

1113
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:53,449
ORION: Well, we could do whatever you wish. If you
care to wish the keep, let's go back to the keep.

1114
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:58,168
We could easily get there and take an airship
back, if we choose to.

1115
01:16:58,168 --> 01:17:03,204
LIAM: We were also talking about visiting
Keyleth's family. Can you get away long enough

1116
01:17:03,204 --> 01:17:04,293
to--

1117
01:17:04,293 --> 01:17:06,130
LAURA: Maybe start the trip with us?

1118
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:11,115
ASHLEY: I think I can. And then, if I have to
leave, at least I can maybe meet your family for

1119
01:17:11,115 --> 01:17:12,203
a little bit.

1120
01:17:12,203 --> 01:17:14,070
TRAVIS: Yeah, Never-Been-Kissed. How's that
sound?

1121
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:18,256
LAURA: Are they your family, technically?

1122
01:17:18,256 --> 01:17:25,005
MARISHA: They're our sister tribe. Because we all
separated.

1123
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:27,869
LIAM: Tell us again. Sorry, explain it again.

1124
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:34,668
MARISHA: Essentially, about 900 years ago or so,
roughly a thousand years ago, we were a nomadic

1125
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:39,466
people. And then there was some sort of great
sundering-- we're actually still not 100% sure; a

1126
01:17:39,466 --> 01:17:48,918
lot of information was lost. And the elemental
planes started bleeding with this plane, and oh,

1127
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:51,236
Vex is falling asleep.

1128
01:17:51,236 --> 01:17:53,883
LIAM: Whoa. Hey, Stubby. Wake up.

1129
01:17:53,883 --> 01:18:00,974
MARISHA: Anyway. Long story short, we separated
into four separate tribes to protect the places

1130
01:18:00,974 --> 01:18:10,025
where the elemental planes bleed into this realm.
Once every generation, someone is nominated to go

1131
01:18:10,025 --> 01:18:17,722
out and make contact with the sister tribes in
order to establish further communication, check

1132
01:18:17,722 --> 01:18:20,611
in, learn about each other's cultures.

1133
01:18:20,611 --> 01:18:23,753
ORION: Interesting.

1134
01:18:23,753 --> 01:18:29,698
MARISHA: We're from the same people, but we each
have our individual cultures because we've been

1135
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:32,134
separated for so long, at this point.

1136
01:18:32,134 --> 01:18:34,739
LAURA: So these ones are Fire.

1137
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:45,869
MARISHA: These ones are Fire, yes, so they're
located in a volcanic region, and you can start to

1138
01:18:45,869 --> 01:18:54,708
feel an energy from where the planes start to
shift, and it gets a little unbalanced. That's

1139
01:18:54,708 --> 01:19:00,506
where we each live, and I'm from the ones where we
protect the Air portals.

1140
01:19:00,506 --> 01:19:03,521
ORION: Lady Keyleth, did you just say where the planes
shift?

1141
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:08,875
MARISHA: Yes, because where all the planes--
almost like a Venn diagram, if you want to think

1142
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:10,191
about it.

1143
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:13,712
ORION: Who is this, who is Van Diagram.

1144
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:20,256
MARISHA: (stuttering) Well, he was a great
philosopher, of one of our peoples. But he

1145
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:24,527
described it as being these overlapping circles.
What's that?

1146
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:26,037
ASHLEY: He was one of the Ashari?

1147
01:19:26,037 --> 01:19:27,130
MARISHA: He was.

1148
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:28,997
ORION: Van Diagram was one of the Ashari.

1149
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,781
MARISHA: Very great man.

1150
01:19:31,781 --> 01:19:39,765
ORION: Quick question about the planes. Will we
travel there, is there any way to, perhaps, get to

1151
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:42,129
the fey woods through these planes.

1152
01:19:42,129 --> 01:19:49,474
MARISHA: We don't necessarily overlap with the
fey. We protect where it overlaps. You could get

1153
01:19:49,474 --> 01:19:55,989
to the fire elemental plane easier from this
place, and my town you can get to the plane of

1154
01:19:55,989 --> 01:19:57,237
Air--

1155
01:19:57,237 --> 01:19:59,626
LAURA: (belches)

1156
01:19:59,626 --> 01:20:01,662
MARISHA: That's a good one, Grog!

1157
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:03,379
TRAVIS: Nope. Not me.

1158
01:20:03,379 --> 01:20:05,103
ORION: That was Vex.

1159
01:20:05,103 --> 01:20:07,303
ASHLEY: That was a good one.

1160
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,223
LIAM: It's nappies time. Nappy time.

1161
01:20:09,223 --> 01:20:12,028
MARISHA: Are you feeling okay, Vex?

1162
01:20:12,028 --> 01:20:13,684
LIAM: Just give her an hour. She'll be fine.

1163
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:14,999
ASHLEY: She just needs some time.

1164
01:20:14,999 --> 01:20:17,505
LIAM: Side note: I'm two inches taller, and I've
always called you Stubby.

1165
01:20:17,505 --> 01:20:19,039
LAURA: Oh.

1166
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:20,784
LIAM: Come here, Stubby.

1167
01:20:20,784 --> 01:20:25,409
MARISHA: But anyway, the last person to go on the
Aramente was my mother, and she never returned, so

1168
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:30,783
we haven't really had contact with the Fire Ashari
for a while.

1169
01:20:30,783 --> 01:20:32,933
TRAVIS: So you're pretty anxious to go, then,
yeah?

1170
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:35,289
MARISHA: I have no idea what they're going to be
like.

1171
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,803
TRAVIS: But you know about where they are, right?

1172
01:20:37,803 --> 01:20:41,908
MARISHA: I've gotten rough directions. We'll have
to probably figure it out along the way.

1173
01:20:41,908 --> 01:20:43,911
TRAVIS: Are we hoofing it? Are we flying?

1174
01:20:43,911 --> 01:20:51,632
ORION: We could do whatever you wish, Grog. Do you
have a particular ability called Magic Weapon?

1175
01:20:51,632 --> 01:20:57,676
ASHLEY: Well, I have Spiritual Weapon. So I guess,
yes?

1176
01:20:57,676 --> 01:20:59,502
ORION: They're different things.

1177
01:20:59,502 --> 01:21:03,909
ASHLEY: Well. What do you want? What are you
looking for?

1178
01:21:03,909 --> 01:21:12,653
ORION: I wanted you to bless my quarterstaff. Make
it magical. I need my staff enchanted. I would

1179
01:21:12,653 --> 01:21:15,122
like you to enchant my staff, Pike.

1180
01:21:15,122 --> 01:21:16,965
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Whoa!

1181
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:19,858
ASHLEY: I know what that means.

1182
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:23,027
MATT: You've been around Scanlan long enough.

1183
01:21:23,027 --> 01:21:27,387
TRAVIS: The holy symbol goes (shattering sound).

1184
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:32,159
ORION: I mean in a strictly platonic, arcane
sense.

1185
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:37,676
MATT: What little knowledge you have of enchanting
items, from your experience, and you had this a

1186
01:21:37,676 --> 01:21:42,149
little bit as well from your own enchanting: the
process of enchanting a weapon into what would be

1187
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:48,422
considered a magical weapon is a weeks-long
process. It's doable, definitely, but it's one of

1188
01:21:48,422 --> 01:21:53,205
those things where you would have to have somebody
sit down with it over a period of time, and daily

1189
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:56,607
instill it with that magical energy until it finds
its permanence within the object.

1190
01:21:56,607 --> 01:22:01,068
ORION: Is there anybody in town I could leave that
with and pay to do that?

1191
01:22:01,068 --> 01:22:03,515
MATT: Probably?

1192
01:22:03,515 --> 01:22:05,060
ORION: A mage?

1193
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:08,503
MATT: Mage, maybe not so much. There are other
clerics.

1194
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:12,085
TALIESIN: It'd be expensive, though. It's
somebody's time for a week.

1195
01:22:12,085 --> 01:22:16,087
MARISHA: It also seems like this is one of those
towns where things are expensive. Things are

1196
01:22:16,087 --> 01:22:17,638
expensive here.

1197
01:22:17,638 --> 01:22:19,773
TRAVIS: Not if you know how to handle them.

1198
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:22,851
ORION: Right. I'll hold off on that.

1199
01:22:22,851 --> 01:22:24,655
MATT: But yes, it is totally doable.

1200
01:22:24,655 --> 01:22:29,517
ORION: Is it a thing that I can like start to do,
hourly for a long, long time?

1201
01:22:29,517 --> 01:22:31,465
MATT: If you wanted to yourself, yeah.

1202
01:22:31,465 --> 01:22:33,845
ORION: Okay, I'm going to start that process right
now.

1203
01:22:33,845 --> 01:22:40,138
LIAM: Here's what I think. Lady Keyleth has been
talking about this for a long time. It's calling

1204
01:22:40,138 --> 01:22:48,156
to her, and we're a family now, and it's her
moment. We're here. They're right nearby. There's

1205
01:22:48,156 --> 01:22:50,523
no use putting it off. Let's go to her family.

1206
01:22:50,523 --> 01:22:53,662
MARISHA: I am so nervous, you guys. I'm so
scared.

1207
01:22:53,662 --> 01:22:59,264
LAURA: Let's go. Should we go in the morning, or
should we go now? Let's go now.

1208
01:22:59,264 --> 01:23:01,443
MARISHA: We'll go in the morning.

1209
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:02,956
ORION: No, let's sleep it off.

1210
01:23:02,956 --> 01:23:06,487
ASHLEY: We'll take just a small nap.

1211
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:09,457
LAURA: All right. Small nap, and then first thing
in the morning.

1212
01:23:09,457 --> 01:23:14,797
TRAVIS: I walk up behind Vex and I tap on 
her opposite shoulder and pull my hand away.

1213
01:23:14,797 --> 01:23:22,402
LAURA: Who's there? Hi, Pike! I'm so glad you're
here.

1214
01:23:22,402 --> 01:23:27,014
LIAM: Could she have one more? You need one more,
Stubby, then you'll go to bed, all right? Then

1215
01:23:27,014 --> 01:23:28,493
you'll go to bed.

1216
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:34,127
MATT: At which point the bartender at the tavern
goes, "Are you sure about that?"

1217
01:23:34,127 --> 01:23:35,685
TRAVIS: Yeah, one more!

1218
01:23:35,685 --> 01:23:37,544
ASHLEY and MARISHA: One more!

1219
01:23:37,544 --> 01:23:45,273
MATT: "All right. But you're cleaning my floor."
And he goes and fills everyone's drink.

1220
01:23:45,273 --> 01:23:48,051
LAURA: I tip him five gold and I give him a wink.

1221
01:23:48,051 --> 01:23:53,003
MATT: He happily takes it, and the wink is a
strong wink. He smiles back, but also gives you

1222
01:23:53,003 --> 01:23:58,452
the look of like, time for bed. You all eventually
finish your drinks and find your way back to your

1223
01:23:58,452 --> 01:24:03,719
respective rooms for the evening and have a good
night's rest. And on that note, we're going to go

1224
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:07,205
ahead and take a five-minute restroom break on our
end. We'll be back here about five minutes or so,

1225
01:24:07,205 --> 01:24:12,764
so don't go too far, and we'll kick back in the
following morning for what appears to be a journey

1226
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:15,021
towards the Pyrah tribe of the Ashari.

1227
01:24:15,021 --> 01:24:17,968
MARISHA: I'm so scared! I'm so nervous!

1228
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:20,165
TALIESIN: You're going to do great!

1229
01:24:20,165 --> 01:36:34,900
[break]

1230
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:42,759
MATT: Hey guys, welcome back! We've had our break,
so as the party comes to consciousness the

1231
01:36:42,759 --> 01:36:50,117
following morning, a very heavy hangover coming
from Vex for the evening of lamenting the loss of

1232
01:36:50,117 --> 01:36:52,681
a number of financial things.

1233
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:59,089
MARISHA: I whip her up a little herbal tonic.
Here. Drink this.

1234
01:36:59,089 --> 01:37:05,698
LIAM: I'm taking Trinket for a walk. For dookies.

1235
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:10,174
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make your beard
roll.

1236
01:37:10,174 --> 01:37:16,920
TRAVIS: Come on, you son of a bitch. Yes! Two,
two! 22!

1237
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:22,294
MATT: 22. As you come to consciousness, Grog wakes
up and shakes his head for a minute, and you look,

1238
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:29,816
and there is a good solid two-inch beard. Where
was once the somewhat clear, stringy,

1239
01:37:29,816 --> 01:37:36,864
fishing-line-type scruff, you're starting to see a
little color come into it. This thick black root

1240
01:37:36,864 --> 01:37:39,241
is now starting to appear at the base of the
beard.

1241
01:37:39,241 --> 01:37:46,036
TRAVIS: (singing) I feel so happy. So happy!

1242
01:37:46,036 --> 01:37:50,763
MATT: It is like horsehair bristles, it's very
thick, and you could probably clean dishes against

1243
01:37:50,763 --> 01:37:51,498
it.

1244
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:54,775
TRAVIS: Is it like an Abe Lincoln beard, or do I
also have a mustache?

1245
01:37:54,775 --> 01:37:58,570
MATT: Actually, for you it's only coming in as a
chinstrap beard, at the moment.

1246
01:37:58,570 --> 01:37:59,942
LIAM: Oh, wow.

1247
01:37:59,942 --> 01:38:01,354
TRAVIS: Don't judge.

1248
01:38:01,354 --> 01:38:10,542
ORION: I see Vex's condition and I run out to get
her a coffee from the bazaar, and then do my

1249
01:38:10,542 --> 01:38:13,404
perception check on the thing.

1250
01:38:13,404 --> 01:38:18,749
MATT: As you're glancing about and getting coffee
for her, you manage to see a cart that's just

1251
01:38:18,749 --> 01:38:22,944
setting up this early in the morning in the
bazaar. You hear some squeaking and growling

1252
01:38:22,944 --> 01:38:28,160
and a couple of bird chirps. You look over to the
side and there is one small setup that has a

1253
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:32,506
number of creatures and small animals and stuff
set up in cages.

1254
01:38:32,506 --> 01:38:39,935
ORION: Oh! As I'm running by because the coffee's
hot. Hot. Oh, excuse me, would you happen to have

1255
01:38:39,935 --> 01:38:47,987
any particular dragonites for sale? Male,
preferably, but I will take female if you have

1256
01:38:47,987 --> 01:38:55,236
one. (quietly) I'm just making it hotter when I
blow on it.

1257
01:38:55,236 --> 01:38:58,826
TALIESIN: That's funny. It took a second.

1258
01:38:58,826 --> 01:39:03,592
TRAVIS: What are dragonites?

1259
01:39:03,592 --> 01:39:06,032
LAURA: Little baby dragons?

1260
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:08,244
LIAM: Like a pseudodragon.

1261
01:39:08,244 --> 01:39:10,303
LAURA: You going to have a little pet, too?

1262
01:39:10,303 --> 01:39:18,972
MATT: Okay. She glances at the coffee in your
hand, "Well, I mean, we've got two that are a bit

1263
01:39:18,972 --> 01:39:22,626
"sickly, but they're for purchase if you like."

1264
01:39:22,626 --> 01:39:28,686
ORION: I would love one. Give me whichever's the
least sickly of the two.

1265
01:39:28,686 --> 01:39:31,250
MATT: "They're both green; it's hard to tell."

1266
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:34,439
ORION: Oh, I'll take the darker green one.

1267
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:37,984
MATT: "Okay. That one's probably more sick, but
I'll take it."

1268
01:39:37,984 --> 01:39:40,725
(laughter)

1269
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:45,672
MATT: Takes the cage down, and you can see there
is this lethargic-looking tiny dragonite that's

1270
01:39:45,672 --> 01:39:50,620
curled up on this small perch, and as she lifts it
off, it goes (lizard noises) and scoffs at the

1271
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:54,131
cage. "That'll be 200 gold pieces."

1272
01:39:54,131 --> 01:39:55,563
ORION: Oh, very good.

1273
01:39:55,563 --> 01:39:58,130
MARISHA: No, don't pay full price for a sick
dragon!

1274
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:01,543
MATT: "There you are, sir. Have a good day."

1275
01:40:01,543 --> 01:40:08,280
ORION: Thank you very much. Any particular tips,
food-wise?

1276
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:15,059
MATT: "Don't let it die. Feed it. Give it water.
Good day, sir."

1277
01:40:15,059 --> 01:40:18,804
ORION: Okay, so I run back and I go, oh, here you
are.

1278
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,045
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

1279
01:40:20,045 --> 01:40:21,301
ASHLEY: Oh, who's that?

1280
01:40:21,301 --> 01:40:22,553
MARISHA: What is that?

1281
01:40:22,553 --> 01:40:24,674
ORION: I think I'm going to name him Lockheed.

1282
01:40:24,674 --> 01:40:26,840
LAURA: Trinket looks very interested in Lockheed.

1283
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,956
MARISHA: He looks a little-- oh...

1284
01:40:29,956 --> 01:40:32,522
MATT: Trinket's nose goes up to the cage
(sniffs).

1285
01:40:32,522 --> 01:40:34,199
ASHLEY: Is he sick?

1286
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:36,459
TALIESIN: I don't think it's supposed to make that
noise.

1287
01:40:36,459 --> 01:40:40,158
ORION: Do you want to do some healing?

1288
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:42,274
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do just a small healing.

1289
01:40:42,274 --> 01:40:44,260
MATT: Medicine check? Okay, go for it.

1290
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:50,144
LIAM: Your bear shat like a fountain. Wasn't
solid. I don't know what you're feeding him. It

1291
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:57,660
was a little runny, sorry. Roughage. He needs
roughage.

1292
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:01,715
LAURA: Trinket, get some vegetables in your diet.

1293
01:41:01,715 --> 01:41:05,585
MATT: (groans, growls)

1294
01:41:05,585 --> 01:41:07,422
LAURA: He likes meat, what can I say?

1295
01:41:07,422 --> 01:41:09,363
ASHLEY: What was I rolling for?

1296
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:11,799
TRAVIS: I missed Pike.

1297
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:15,233
ASHLEY: Checking about the health. I rolled a
seven.

1298
01:41:15,233 --> 01:41:18,820
MATT: He doesn't look the healthiest.

1299
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:21,239
ASHLEY: He looks really sick!

1300
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:25,226
MARISHA: Can I check him out? Is he considered an
animal?

1301
01:41:25,226 --> 01:41:26,690
MATT: No.

1302
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:28,477
MARISHA: Can I check him out?

1303
01:41:28,477 --> 01:41:30,811
LIAM: Oh, but he's a little cutie, isn't he?

1304
01:41:30,811 --> 01:41:35,622
TRAVIS: I like him. Can I put my finger in the
cage?

1305
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:36,747
ORION: Lockheed.

1306
01:41:36,747 --> 01:41:37,950
MARISHA and LAURA: Lockheed.

1307
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:39,927
TRAVIS: I put my finger in the cage and go, hello,
Lockheed!

1308
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:43,481
MATT: As soon as your finger gets to the edge,
(snaps) he bites on the finger.

1309
01:41:43,481 --> 01:41:46,518
TRAVIS: He's a real peach.

1310
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:49,917
MATT: You take a point of damage.

1311
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:51,286
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

1312
01:41:51,286 --> 01:41:53,308
ASHLEY: Maybe you should name him Lockheed Peach.

1313
01:41:53,308 --> 01:41:55,346
MARISHA: Aw, Lockheed Peach.

1314
01:41:55,346 --> 01:41:57,413
ORION: I think Lockheed is good enough.

1315
01:41:57,413 --> 01:42:01,216
MARISHA: Can I do a check on him and see
if I make him feel better?

1316
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,556
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1317
01:42:02,556 --> 01:42:05,751
MARISHA: Medicine check? Oh that's not bad. 19
total.

1318
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:15,111
MATT: You gather this may be some sort of a
general illness that lingers for a couple of

1319
01:42:15,111 --> 01:42:20,382
weeks. Properly fed and taken care of, would
probably be able to get it through its system.

1320
01:42:20,382 --> 01:42:24,117
MARISHA: I reach in my pouch and pull out a few
Goodberries.

1321
01:42:24,117 --> 01:42:34,110
MATT: Okay. You feed him through the cage.
Reluctant to eat the first piece. Eventually, it

1322
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:37,127
takes a bite and then begins to eat the rest
through the cage as you continue through

1323
01:42:37,127 --> 01:42:38,357
breakfast.

1324
01:42:38,357 --> 01:42:39,960
LAURA: Can you speak with animals, Keyleth?

1325
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:44,192
MARISHA: I can, but he's not an animal. He's a
dragon-guy.

1326
01:42:44,192 --> 01:42:49,402
ASHLEY: Is he starting to look any better? Could I
try healing him a little bit?

1327
01:42:49,402 --> 01:42:54,489
MATT: You can try healing. It's more of a
disease-based illness.

1328
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:56,651
MARISHA: Just feed him, lots of water--

1329
01:42:56,651 --> 01:43:00,091
TRAVIS: I have some dry food rations if you want
to give him a nibble.

1330
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,565
MARISHA: I gave him some Goodberries. I'll make up
some more Goodberries.

1331
01:43:02,565 --> 01:43:06,456
ORION: We have a bunch of food and stuff. We'll be
fine. We can move on with the journey.

1332
01:43:06,456 --> 01:43:17,043
LAURA: So, it's groggy, but we decided to go see
your family, right? Right now?

1333
01:43:17,043 --> 01:43:19,237
MARISHA: I mean, I don't want to inconvenience
anyone.

1334
01:43:19,237 --> 01:43:20,603
LAURA: We're going, Keyleth.

1335
01:43:20,603 --> 01:43:21,714
ASHLEY: We're doing it!

1336
01:43:21,714 --> 01:43:22,958
TRAVIS: There's fire.

1337
01:43:22,958 --> 01:43:25,016
LIAM: I've always wanted to see a volcano,
anyway.

1338
01:43:25,016 --> 01:43:26,712
TALIESIN: Yes, it sounds lovely.

1339
01:43:26,712 --> 01:43:30,180
LAURA: I'm sure they're all as charming as you
are.

1340
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,840
TRAVIS: You'll win them over.

1341
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,836
ORION: You'll be fine.

1342
01:43:33,836 --> 01:43:39,113
TALIESIN: What's the worst that could happen? Oh,
never mind. That was rhetorical. Don't actually

1343
01:43:39,113 --> 01:43:41,356
want to know what the worst that could happen
would be.

1344
01:43:41,356 --> 01:43:43,876
MARISHA: I have to do a trial and meet their
headmaster.

1345
01:43:43,876 --> 01:43:46,582
TRAVIS: Royal stuff.

1346
01:43:46,582 --> 01:43:48,332
MARISHA: Yeah.

1347
01:43:48,332 --> 01:43:54,274
LIAM: Keyleth, I saw you pile-drive a beholder.
Pretty sure you're going to be all right.

1348
01:43:54,274 --> 01:43:55,568
TRAVIS: That's true.

1349
01:43:55,568 --> 01:43:56,912
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're going to do it.

1350
01:43:56,912 --> 01:44:02,276
MARISHA: It's not even that. It's sometimes
learning about your past can be equally as

1351
01:44:02,276 --> 01:44:06,850
terrifying. I don't know what I'm going to find.

1352
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:09,039
ORION: Well, let's go discover it.

1353
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:21,237
MARISHA: Well, from what I heard, we head south
towards Sunder Peak. Towards the southwest, it's

1354
01:44:21,237 --> 01:44:22,773
volcanic territory.

1355
01:44:22,773 --> 01:44:26,353
TRAVIS: Should we ask how far it is?

1356
01:44:26,353 --> 01:44:30,544
MARISHA: Maybe. I only got vague directions.

1357
01:44:30,544 --> 01:44:33,674
LIAM: Can we see Sunder Peak from here?

1358
01:44:33,674 --> 01:44:39,234
MATT: The landscape is very heavily wooded, and
the canopy of the forest tends to rise and lower

1359
01:44:39,234 --> 01:44:43,841
about the height of the wall itself. You can't
really see anything beyond the wall of the city of

1360
01:44:43,841 --> 01:44:45,638
Vasselheim, anyway.

1361
01:44:45,638 --> 01:44:51,056
LAURA: So remember that way, we found a hydra, so
we might come across some terrible things.

1362
01:44:51,056 --> 01:44:55,570
TRAVIS: One of you wordsmiths go talk to somebody
and ask directions.

1363
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:57,720
LAURA: I flag down the nearest person.

1364
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,397
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1365
01:44:59,397 --> 01:45:06,362
TALIESIN: It's happening. There's nothing you can
do to stop this anymore. Embrace the inevitable.

1366
01:45:06,362 --> 01:45:08,923
LAURA: 15.

1367
01:45:08,923 --> 01:45:13,801
MATT: Asking around and gathering a few folks and
asking them questions, eventually you flag down

1368
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:19,916
one guy at the far end of the tavern; he's an
amateur cartographer who's in the middle of

1369
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:25,910
sketching out the nearest area. He talks to you
for a bit and you mention Sunder Peak Mountains

1370
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:30,605
and he goes, "Oh yeah, yes, no. Sunder Peak. It's
not too far from Vasselheim. It's about two days'

1371
01:45:30,605 --> 01:45:37,117
"travel, on horseback southwest. The Sunder Peak
Mountains themselves, be careful; they're pretty

1372
01:45:37,117 --> 01:45:41,493
"steep. I haven't actually gone within the mountain
range myself, but I've been within a few miles of

1373
01:45:41,493 --> 01:45:49,585
"it just to make sure that I can mark it on my map,
but yeah. It should be fine. Stay on the road."

1374
01:45:49,585 --> 01:45:51,111
LAURA: Okay, stay on the road.

1375
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:56,585
MARISHA: Do you actually have a map that we could
use? Borrow?

1376
01:45:56,585 --> 01:46:04,697
MATT: "This is not done. And I need to finish it
before I can give it to a printer to make more."

1377
01:46:04,697 --> 01:46:07,441
TRAVIS: What's your girlfriend's name?

1378
01:46:07,441 --> 01:46:12,866
MATT: "I should go." And he folds up his map.

1379
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:19,785
LAURA: No, wait! We'll be on the lookout for key
things in the landscape to maybe give you

1380
01:46:19,785 --> 01:46:21,611
information for your maps?

1381
01:46:21,611 --> 01:46:24,057
MATT: "Well, that would be very helpful."

1382
01:46:24,057 --> 01:46:25,597
LAURA: What's your name?

1383
01:46:25,597 --> 01:46:27,065
MATT: "Tyriok."

1384
01:46:27,065 --> 01:46:28,202
LAURA: Tyriok?

1385
01:46:28,202 --> 01:46:29,544
MATT: "Tyriok."

1386
01:46:29,544 --> 01:46:35,790
LIAM: Matthew, we've been doing this for three
years, and you still fucking blow me away game

1387
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:43,849
after game. I'm sorry. Tyriok, I meant to say.

1388
01:46:43,849 --> 01:46:49,798
MATT: "Anything you come across, please do take
note of it. If you require a small piece of

1389
01:46:49,798 --> 01:46:51,753
"parchment, I can perhaps provide that as well."

1390
01:46:51,753 --> 01:46:53,675
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1391
01:46:53,675 --> 01:46:56,807
ASHLEY: Wait, what happens if you don't stay on
the road?

1392
01:46:56,807 --> 01:46:59,241
MATT: "Well, forests tend to-- "

1393
01:46:59,241 --> 01:47:01,696
ASHLEY: I mean I have an idea, but--

1394
01:47:01,696 --> 01:47:04,921
MATT: "There are things that live there that are
generally pretty dangerous. They've had people

1395
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:08,706
"who've travelled on these routes and at some point
they've been attacked. Or worse, never came

1396
01:47:08,706 --> 01:47:09,865
"back."

1397
01:47:09,865 --> 01:47:12,553
ASHLEY: Wow. Do you know what they've been
attacked by?

1398
01:47:12,553 --> 01:47:13,982
MATT: "I haven't."

1399
01:47:13,982 --> 01:47:15,520
ASHLEY: You don't know.

1400
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,808
LAURA and MARISHA: Hydra.

1401
01:47:16,808 --> 01:47:18,152
ASHLEY: Hydra?

1402
01:47:18,152 --> 01:47:19,858
LAURA: We fought a hydra, Pike.

1403
01:47:19,858 --> 01:47:21,967
ASHLEY: Not as in the-- I understand.

1404
01:47:21,967 --> 01:47:25,161
LAURA: Like, five heads.

1405
01:47:25,161 --> 01:47:32,992
MATT: Glances back over at Grog's ominous stare
towards him again. "I should be leaving."

1406
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,408
LAURA: Parchment.

1407
01:47:34,408 --> 01:47:38,844
MATT: "Yes." Hands you this rolled-up piece,
relatively well-made.

1408
01:47:38,844 --> 01:47:40,847
LAURA: We will use this to make notes.

1409
01:47:40,847 --> 01:47:42,875
MATT: "I appreciate that greatly."

1410
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:45,165
MARISHA: You wouldn't happen to have a compass,
would you?

1411
01:47:45,165 --> 01:47:47,568
MATT: "No? Not that I can lend out."

1412
01:47:47,568 --> 01:47:52,634
TALIESIN: We could make a compass if we really
needed one. It's not hard to make a compass.

1413
01:47:52,634 --> 01:47:55,876
MATT: "Anyway. I'm usually here in the morning.
Just going about my business. So whenever you need

1414
01:47:55,876 --> 01:47:57,048
"to find me--"

1415
01:47:57,048 --> 01:47:58,911
LAURA and MARISHA: Tyriok.

1416
01:47:58,911 --> 01:48:10,980
MATT: He goes and heads off. You guys are welcome
to prepare as you wish.

1417
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:14,136
LIAM: Well, we need horses, right? We don't want
to walk.

1418
01:48:14,136 --> 01:48:16,456
LAURA: Don't we have horses from our previous--

1419
01:48:16,456 --> 01:48:18,560
MATT: Your team has horses. This team does not.

1420
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,022
LAURA: But we have enough horses for all of us,
from our previous run.

1421
01:48:23,022 --> 01:48:24,401
TALIESIN: We had two extra horses.

1422
01:48:24,401 --> 01:48:25,480
MATT: You did.

1423
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:28,777
LAURA: Yeah. Let's just take those horses. We
don't even have to pay for them.

1424
01:48:28,777 --> 01:48:30,432
MARISHA: Awesome.

1425
01:48:30,432 --> 01:48:33,942
TRAVIS: I need a new horse, because mine's back,
the horse--

1426
01:48:33,942 --> 01:48:35,480
LAURA: The back buckled?

1427
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:37,917
TALIESIN: You can ride the bear.

1428
01:48:37,917 --> 01:48:39,632
LAURA: No, he can't.

1429
01:48:39,632 --> 01:48:43,204
MATT: It was pretty rough getting you there, even
as a warhorse. You weigh a lot.

1430
01:48:43,204 --> 01:48:45,289
TRAVIS: So probably a new horse.

1431
01:48:45,289 --> 01:48:48,804
MARISHA: Wait. You drove the horse into the
ground?

1432
01:48:48,804 --> 01:48:52,763
LAURA: Okay, so we need two extra horses.

1433
01:48:52,763 --> 01:48:58,984
LIAM: Oh, we're getting more? Did you bust up the
last one?

1434
01:48:58,984 --> 01:49:01,301
TRAVIS: He's all like this.

1435
01:49:01,301 --> 01:49:08,018
LAURA: Okay. Let's go find a couple of horses. I'm
going to ride Trinket, so we only need one extra

1436
01:49:08,018 --> 01:49:09,074
horse.

1437
01:49:09,074 --> 01:49:10,772
MARISHA: A warhorse for Grog.

1438
01:49:10,772 --> 01:49:17,044
LAURA: Yes? I go get a horse for Grog.

1439
01:49:17,044 --> 01:49:27,218
MATT: Okay. The cost of the warhorse. Initially,
when you get there, the stablehand who you talked

1440
01:49:27,218 --> 01:49:34,769
to originally, "You've gone already through it. I
can offer you another war horse. We're starting to

1441
01:49:34,769 --> 01:49:37,316
"run a little low, if you keep tearing through them
at this rate."

1442
01:49:37,316 --> 01:49:39,345
LAURA: Well, we'll say we're covered though,
yeah.

1443
01:49:39,345 --> 01:49:41,862
MATT: "Oh, that's 400 gold to purchase yourself a
warhorse."

1444
01:49:41,862 --> 01:49:49,945
LAURA: Oh, 400. Darling, remember who we are. We
gave you excellent business before. I have no idea

1445
01:49:49,945 --> 01:49:51,216
what I'm saying.

1446
01:49:51,216 --> 01:49:53,317
TRAVIS: Come on, this is your thing. Come on.

1447
01:49:53,317 --> 01:49:58,228
LAURA: I think, as a return customer, you can
offer us more of a deal than that.

1448
01:49:58,228 --> 01:50:00,134
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1449
01:50:00,134 --> 01:50:05,581
LAURA: Come on. Natural 20!

1450
01:50:05,581 --> 01:50:07,636
(shouting)

1451
01:50:07,636 --> 01:50:10,728
TRAVIS: It's verified. That's a 20.

1452
01:50:10,728 --> 01:50:25,429
MATT: He goes, "Here. How about this. I will,
based on your previous patronage, and if you can

1453
01:50:25,429 --> 01:50:29,534
"ensure that you would continue to send business my
way, I would be happy to give it to you at half

1454
01:50:29,534 --> 01:50:30,609
"price."

1455
01:50:30,609 --> 01:50:35,754
LAURA: Of course. Half price is a very fair deal.
Grog. Pay the man.

1456
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:42,901
TRAVIS: Would you be interested in negotiating?
Right. 200 gold.

1457
01:50:42,901 --> 01:50:45,854
MATT: (chuckling) Mark off 200 gold.

1458
01:50:45,854 --> 01:50:55,038
ORION: Wait, for two horses? Don't we need two?

1459
01:50:55,038 --> 01:50:58,519
MATT: There was a warhorse for him, and then
there's two amongst you. I don't know if you

1460
01:50:58,519 --> 01:51:00,627
wanted to become a horse and run.

1461
01:51:00,627 --> 01:51:05,130
LAURA: I was going to ride Trinket so that there
were three for them.

1462
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:08,028
TRAVIS: You could take the busted-up horse. It
just can't carry me anymore.

1463
01:51:08,028 --> 01:51:10,137
LIAM: Trinket could take Pike, too, with you.

1464
01:51:10,137 --> 01:51:11,762
LAURA: Yeah, me and Pike will ride Trinket.

1465
01:51:11,762 --> 01:51:13,125
MATT: Okay. Well, then you're fine.

1466
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:18,087
ORION: Is there another warhorse for sale for that
price? Can we get the two for 400?

1467
01:51:18,087 --> 01:51:23,239
MATT: If you ask about this, he's like, "That
wasn't part of the deal. If you want another

1468
01:51:23,239 --> 01:51:26,350
"warhorse, that's a different transaction
entirely."

1469
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:28,489
ORION: I'll take one. Full price. I won't
bargain.

1470
01:51:28,489 --> 01:51:31,661
MATT: "400 gold."

1471
01:51:31,661 --> 01:51:33,426
ASHLEY: Wait, but where do you put Lockheed
Peach?

1472
01:51:33,426 --> 01:51:36,721
MATT: "All right. Well, I'm afraid we're fresh out
of war horses going forward. We'll have to make

1473
01:51:36,721 --> 01:51:41,732
"sure our tamer goes out, and probably be a few
months before we get another load, so take care of

1474
01:51:41,732 --> 01:51:43,124
"what you have."

1475
01:51:43,124 --> 01:51:46,226
ORION: How much extra for some side saddles?

1476
01:51:46,226 --> 01:51:51,639
MATT: "Side saddles for that? I'll throw those in
for free, for full price purchase, certainly. Side

1477
01:51:51,639 --> 01:51:53,738
"saddlebags for your warhorse."

1478
01:51:53,738 --> 01:52:00,527
LAURA: Tiberius, I want it to be known that if you
keep asking me for party funds, I will not be

1479
01:52:00,527 --> 01:52:01,495
so--

1480
01:52:01,495 --> 01:52:08,209
ORION: These are my personal, of course. I would
not want to upset you again, milady Vex. I have

1481
01:52:08,209 --> 01:52:09,829
missed your company.

1482
01:52:09,829 --> 01:52:12,112
LAURA: You're so charming today, Tiberius.

1483
01:52:12,112 --> 01:52:13,542
LIAM: He called you a lady.

1484
01:52:13,542 --> 01:52:14,859
LAURA: He did.

1485
01:52:14,859 --> 01:52:17,756
(laughter)

1486
01:52:17,756 --> 01:52:20,101
LAURA: Let's go see your family.

1487
01:52:20,101 --> 01:52:21,652
MARISHA: (high-pitched) Okay!

1488
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:24,750
TRAVIS: And then if we get-- if we get just
outside of the-- I'll wait.

1489
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:29,687
MATT: Okay. You guys gather your horses, fresh
warhorse and saddlebags upon yours as well,

1490
01:52:29,687 --> 01:52:35,139
Tiberius. Fine sturdy steeds. This one looks to be
a little more physically built than the previous

1491
01:52:35,139 --> 01:52:39,944
one you purchased. Hopefully, it should last you a
little longer. Hopefully. You make your way

1492
01:52:39,944 --> 01:52:45,402
towards the southern gate of Vasselheim. The
Bastions open it for you and lead you out to the

1493
01:52:45,402 --> 01:52:54,730
front road that exits the south side of the city.
Slowly, it begins to divide into a southeast and

1494
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:59,905
southwest direction. You guys, using the
directions you acquired previously, begin pushing

1495
01:52:59,905 --> 01:53:06,368
yourself in the southwestern direction of the
path, leading you deep into the Vesper

1496
01:53:06,368 --> 01:53:12,752
Timberlands. You notice the canopy of the forest
itself is so thick and high that it is not so much

1497
01:53:12,752 --> 01:53:18,902
an open pathway more than it is an open archway, a
tunnel that has been carved through the forest for

1498
01:53:18,902 --> 01:53:25,398
this path. It is a very dense, very dark-- even in
the midday sun-- pathway, and it progresses this

1499
01:53:25,398 --> 01:53:31,720
way for miles and miles. You can hear birds and
the wildlife living loudly and out in the open

1500
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:38,483
amongst this forest. There are certain portions of
the trail that you do see are being encroached

1501
01:53:38,483 --> 01:53:45,617
upon by the forest and trees themselves. There are
roots and vines that begin to stretch and try to

1502
01:53:45,617 --> 01:53:50,013
reclaim the road, and you get the sensation that
people that traverse here a lot have to

1503
01:53:50,013 --> 01:53:55,663
perpetually keep it clear. There is something
about this forest that in itself is its own

1504
01:53:55,663 --> 01:54:00,472
breathing entity beyond what a normal forest would
be. It seems to grow at a much faster pace, and

1505
01:54:00,472 --> 01:54:06,080
even your previous experience in the deep portions
of this forest, it almost has its own omnipresent,

1506
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,958
malicious presence.

1507
01:54:08,958 --> 01:54:17,086
Continuing down for the rest of the day,
eventually the sun comes to set and what little

1508
01:54:17,086 --> 01:54:23,944
bit of moonlight that would find its way through
the canopy is entirely cut off by the thickness of

1509
01:54:23,944 --> 01:54:29,395
the leaves and boughs of the trees. You can
continue to go through the night, if you wish to.

1510
01:54:29,395 --> 01:54:31,751
ORION: Light! (igniting sound)

1511
01:54:31,751 --> 01:54:38,987
MATT: A big beacon of light blasts out, continuing
pushing forward down this pathway. It's about

1512
01:54:38,987 --> 01:54:44,510
9:30pm, and you have pretty good visual in front
of you based on the light source that is Tiberius.

1513
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:47,336
How long do you want to push on forward?

1514
01:54:47,336 --> 01:54:53,722
LAURA: I'm a little concerned, Tiberius. I'm
afraid that some creatures might be attracted to

1515
01:54:53,722 --> 01:54:56,514
that light source. It might actually be best to--

1516
01:54:56,514 --> 01:54:58,309
ORION: Oh. (snuffing sound)

1517
01:54:58,309 --> 01:55:01,992
MATT: Darkness once again takes the pathway.

1518
01:55:01,992 --> 01:55:03,884
LIAM: Is there any moonlight?

1519
01:55:03,884 --> 01:55:09,838
MATT: You gather, glancing up, there are fractions
and little pieces that give you the sense that

1520
01:55:09,838 --> 01:55:14,046
some of the clouds have parted, and moonlight
would be visible if you weren't underneath such a

1521
01:55:14,046 --> 01:55:19,871
thick canopy of brush. If not for your darkvision
and the little bit of light in there, you'd have

1522
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:21,401
no visual.

1523
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:27,495
LAURA: Light the end of your staff.

1524
01:55:27,495 --> 01:55:32,034
ORION: I'm going to cast Light under one of the
flaps of my robe. (igniting sound)

1525
01:55:32,034 --> 01:55:38,255
LIAM: Tibs. I pull off and hand him my Cloak of
Elvenkind, which is one of the reasons I'm so hard

1526
01:55:38,255 --> 01:55:46,046
to see. Maybe we could just use that as a shroud
for it, just for tonight. I'll pass it to Tibs.

1527
01:55:46,046 --> 01:55:51,029
ORION: (igniting sound) I'll cast it under that,
and you can be the source of light.

1528
01:55:51,029 --> 01:55:58,747
MATT: Instead of a beaming beacon of bright light,
it has now become essentially a hood lantern that

1529
01:55:58,747 --> 01:56:01,098
you are now directionally focusing.

1530
01:56:01,098 --> 01:56:03,058
ORION: Now you look really cool.

1531
01:56:03,058 --> 01:56:07,936
TRAVIS: Do we want to push on, or do we want to
rest? We should push on.

1532
01:56:07,936 --> 01:56:10,278
MARISHA: I mean, we're all right, right?

1533
01:56:10,278 --> 01:56:11,758
TRAVIS: We're all right.

1534
01:56:11,758 --> 01:56:13,199
MARISHA: We're on a path?

1535
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:14,627
LIAM: 9:00 at night, you said?

1536
01:56:14,627 --> 01:56:15,889
MATT: It's 9:00 at night, yeah.

1537
01:56:15,889 --> 01:56:18,339
LIAM: I think it's time to bed down. I mean, we're
not in Los Angeles.

1538
01:56:18,339 --> 01:56:22,137
MARISHA: How far did we make it?

1539
01:56:22,137 --> 01:56:28,479
MATT: I'd say, from when you left, it's probably
been about six hours of travel, approximately, to

1540
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:29,858
where you are now.

1541
01:56:29,858 --> 01:56:32,166
LAURA: Ooh, it would be smart. We've got another
day's travel tomorrow.

1542
01:56:32,166 --> 01:56:34,072
TRAVIS: Okay. Make camp.

1543
01:56:34,072 --> 01:56:36,394
TALIESIN: Let's bed down. It's not like we don't
have to sleep eventually.

1544
01:56:36,394 --> 01:56:38,310
TRAVIS: I'll take the first watch.

1545
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:42,134
MARISHA: I'll do my Anti-Life Shell for the first
hour. That way we all get an hour of good sleep.

1546
01:56:42,134 --> 01:56:50,328
TRAVIS: Can I trace back a hundred yards and Dust
of Tracelessness it, from where we came?

1547
01:56:50,328 --> 01:56:54,679
LAURA: The Hunter's Mark that I cast on that
merchant. Did he stay in town, or is he out and

1548
01:56:54,679 --> 01:56:56,402
about? Can I sense that?

1549
01:56:56,402 --> 01:56:58,343
MATT: At this distance?

1550
01:56:58,343 --> 01:57:05,730
LAURA: Six measly little hours of travel. I can
track it.

1551
01:57:05,730 --> 01:57:09,648
LIAM: Are you haggling with the fabric of time and
space?

1552
01:57:09,648 --> 01:57:12,832
LAURA: No, I'm just seeing if I can track the dude
I put a Hunter's Mark on, is all.

1553
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:16,749
TRAVIS: She went back to the 30s.

1554
01:57:16,749 --> 01:57:18,647
LAURA and TRAVIS: See?

1555
01:57:18,647 --> 01:57:29,168
MATT: I would say, at this distance, if you've
travelled you've lost contact with him, however on

1556
01:57:29,168 --> 01:57:35,061
the way out you got the sensation that he was
still in the city, just not in the thoroughfare

1557
01:57:35,061 --> 01:57:37,649
that he was originally spotted in.

1558
01:57:37,649 --> 01:57:40,067
TRAVIS: Mourning getting negotiated so hard.

1559
01:57:40,067 --> 01:57:41,365
MATT: All right, so.

1560
01:57:41,365 --> 01:57:47,494
ORION: I'm going to roll real quick. I was going
to do animal handling; that's the roll? Animal

1561
01:57:47,494 --> 01:57:54,266
handling every day so I can train it to do stuff?
So I didn't gain a point today. And I take out the

1562
01:57:54,266 --> 01:57:59,141
Decanter of Endless Water-- water, anybody?-- And
then I'm feeding Lockheed some.

1563
01:57:59,141 --> 01:58:03,413
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast some more
ammunition, since I'm out.

1564
01:58:03,413 --> 01:58:10,088
MARISHA: I pull out my little book of druid spells
and history, and I start freshening up on some

1565
01:58:10,088 --> 01:58:11,603
fire spells.

1566
01:58:11,603 --> 01:58:15,630
LAURA: I try to get Trinket to eat some
vegetables.

1567
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,491
LIAM: I pass the fuck out.

1568
01:58:17,491 --> 01:58:23,568
MATT: (laughs) You conk out. Trinket takes to a
couple, but seems to be reluctant as it's not what

1569
01:58:23,568 --> 01:58:27,428
he's used to. It's a good start but Trinket still
likes the comfort of fresh meat.

1570
01:58:27,428 --> 01:58:31,724
LAURA: Trinket! Your uncle said your poo is runny.
You need to eat some veggies.

1571
01:58:31,724 --> 01:58:36,416
MATT: (bear noises) Trinket nuzzles his nose and
pushes it out of your hand on to the ground.

1572
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:43,582
TRAVIS: If I have the first watch, I have
darkvision, and I take out my Firebrand Warhammer

1573
01:58:43,582 --> 01:58:45,482
as I begin my watch.

1574
01:58:45,482 --> 01:58:47,681
MATT: Okay. It burns like a torch in your hand.

1575
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:49,245
TRAVIS: No, no fire.

1576
01:58:49,245 --> 01:58:54,423
MATT: No fire. Okay. You, because the only
supplies you have to craft some ammunition without

1577
01:58:54,423 --> 01:58:58,450
having an actual smithy at your disposal, it is
possible; it's just difficult. So go ahead and

1578
01:58:58,450 --> 01:59:01,635
take your tinker's tool check with disadvantage.

1579
01:59:01,635 --> 01:59:09,957
TALIESIN: God damn it. 14.

1580
01:59:09,957 --> 01:59:19,540
MATT: 14? You use the remainder of your supplies
that are currently on you. You manage to construct

1581
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:26,497
12 rounds of ammunition for your Pepperbox, but
you are currently out after that. And you were

1582
01:59:26,497 --> 01:59:28,521
down to about three pieces left?

1583
01:59:28,521 --> 01:59:30,865
TALIESIN: I was getting a little iffy.

1584
01:59:30,865 --> 01:59:34,879
MATT: I put you at a total of 15 bullets for your
Pepperbox.

1585
01:59:34,879 --> 01:59:37,762
LAURA: Can you use bulette armor to make more
bullets?

1586
01:59:37,762 --> 01:59:44,490
TALIESIN: I can use metal. They're basically made
of iron, so honestly I don't know.

1587
01:59:44,490 --> 01:59:49,158
TRAVIS: We have two more pieces of broken-up armor
and a lantern. And manacles.

1588
01:59:49,158 --> 01:59:54,635
LIAM: And you're on watch, right? Before I passed
out I handed him my cloak, all wadded up in a ball

1589
01:59:54,635 --> 01:59:56,543
around it, and handed it to him.

1590
01:59:56,543 --> 02:00:02,023
MATT: Okay. It's hard for you to repurpose
anything metal without an actual smelter.

1591
02:00:02,023 --> 02:00:07,042
TALIESIN: Yeah. I knew I would just get a little
bit on the road right now.

1592
02:00:07,042 --> 02:00:13,374
MATT: Yeah. And you can try for the Bad News
ammunition. You should be about five shots left.

1593
02:00:13,374 --> 02:00:16,146
TALIESIN: Five shots. That sounds about enough.

1594
02:00:16,146 --> 02:00:19,686
ORION: So to take a long rest, I take can one hour
or two hours? To still have a long rest and do

1595
02:00:19,686 --> 02:00:21,088
stuff.

1596
02:00:21,088 --> 02:00:23,136
MATT: A long rest is eight hours.

1597
02:00:23,136 --> 02:00:31,156
ORION: So an hour before that, I'm starting to
enchant the staff.

1598
02:00:31,172 --> 02:00:37,820
MATT: Enchanting for a staff is a day focus. You
can do it slowly over time to help offset that,

1599
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:41,642
but it'll take you a lot longer to do it on the
road. It's more of like, when you get back and you

1600
02:00:41,642 --> 02:00:48,553
want to focus on enchanting it, you can get it
done. Cool. You go over your spells, you have that

1601
02:00:48,553 --> 02:00:51,927
crafted, torch, anything else before you go to
bed?

1602
02:00:51,927 --> 02:00:57,666
TALIESIN: Do I get an up to my hit points at level
11? Do I get to roll more hit points at level 11?

1603
02:00:57,666 --> 02:01:00,443
MATT: Yes. Have you not done that yet?

1604
02:01:00,443 --> 02:01:02,925
TALIESIN: I haven't done anything other than take
my new abilities.

1605
02:01:02,925 --> 02:01:04,690
MATT: Okay, well let's go ahead and do that right
now.

1606
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:05,813
TALIESIN: Roll a d10?

1607
02:01:05,813 --> 02:01:08,030
MATT: d10 plus your constitution modifier. Percy
is now level 11.

1608
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:09,343
TALIESIN: Yeah, that happened.

1609
02:01:09,343 --> 02:01:10,532
TRAVIS: Welcome!

1610
02:01:10,532 --> 02:01:11,800
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1611
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:18,492
ALL: (sing the Super Mario level complete music)

1612
02:01:18,492 --> 02:01:23,311
TALIESIN: That's ten. I'm up ten points. Hit
points.

1613
02:01:23,311 --> 02:01:26,880
MATT: What'd you roll?

1614
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:30,067
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight, and my constitution
modifier is two.

1615
02:01:30,067 --> 02:01:31,666
MATT: Right, ten more hit points.

1616
02:01:31,666 --> 02:01:35,256
MARISHA: Oh and actually, you know what. Before we
go to sleep, or actually first thing in the

1617
02:01:35,256 --> 02:01:36,875
morning before I learn my new spells--

1618
02:01:36,875 --> 02:01:38,469
MATT: You're also three attacks per round now,
which is awesome.

1619
02:01:38,469 --> 02:01:40,025
TALIESIN: Yes, I am.

1620
02:01:40,025 --> 02:01:46,950
MARISHA: I'm also going to go ahead and be like,
hey guys. I made breakfast! And make a Heroes'

1621
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:48,056
Feast.

1622
02:01:48,056 --> 02:01:49,927
LAURA: Another Heroes' Feast?

1623
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:51,656
TRAVIS: At night or in the morning?

1624
02:01:51,656 --> 02:01:54,118
MARISHA: At night, because I had it learned.

1625
02:01:54,118 --> 02:01:58,652
MATT: Everyone's going to eat a Heroes' Feast
before bed? Okay?

1626
02:01:58,652 --> 02:02:01,773
LAURA: Wait. How long does it last us?

1627
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:03,170
MARISHA: 24 hours?

1628
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:04,677
MATT: Yeah, it's 24 hours.

1629
02:02:04,677 --> 02:02:06,162
LAURA: Okay, so until we go to bed tomorrow.

1630
02:02:06,162 --> 02:02:08,545
MARISHA: Yeah. Because I'm learning new spells in
the morning.

1631
02:02:08,545 --> 02:02:10,031
TALIESIN: What do we get?

1632
02:02:10,031 --> 02:02:17,337
MATT: As you pull out the second gem-encrusted
bowl that you purchased in the bazaar earlier, you

1633
02:02:17,337 --> 02:02:24,639
mark off another thousand gold pieces from your
personal fund, and as you guys watch, Keyleth all

1634
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:28,964
of a sudden puts her hands out in front of her,
and from the very earth itself around your

1635
02:02:28,964 --> 02:02:35,973
campsite (fwoosh) springs forth this long table of
cornucopias and fruits and fine meats. The smell

1636
02:02:35,973 --> 02:02:40,834
permeates the air like the best eating hall you've
ever been to.

1637
02:02:40,834 --> 02:02:42,443
ORION: Oh! Bananas!

1638
02:02:42,443 --> 02:02:44,745
MARISHA: I thought of you.

1639
02:02:44,745 --> 02:02:48,005
LAURA: This is amazing, Keyleth.

1640
02:02:48,005 --> 02:02:51,499
ASHLEY: Oh, man!

1641
02:02:51,499 --> 02:02:54,750
TRAVIS: I pick up Keyleth, I give her a big
squeeze. Oh, thank you.

1642
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:56,260
MARISHA: (choking noises) Grog!

1643
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:58,045
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. I drop her.

1644
02:02:58,045 --> 02:03:00,701
ASHLEY: I'm going to try the carpet again.

1645
02:03:00,701 --> 02:03:04,265
MATT: Okay, so as you're eating and chopping, you
step away from the table and set the carpet down,

1646
02:03:04,265 --> 02:03:09,763
and you grab your holy symbol, and you close your
eyes, praying up to Sarenrae to hopefully in some

1647
02:03:09,763 --> 02:03:13,561
way, shape, or form, be of an aid in restoring
this once-enchanted ally.

1648
02:03:13,561 --> 02:03:15,130
TRAVIS: Be a zero or a one.

1649
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:16,616
ASHLEY: Two.

1650
02:03:16,616 --> 02:03:19,942
LAURA: Isn't that good, to roll a two?

1651
02:03:19,942 --> 02:03:22,039
TRAVIS: She has to hit 11 or under.

1652
02:03:22,039 --> 02:03:29,376
MATT: You sense that once again, the attention of
Sarenrae is scattered. And at this moment in time,

1653
02:03:29,376 --> 02:03:35,916
you feel like there is little attention towards
this small arcane artifact that was lost not of

1654
02:03:35,916 --> 02:03:37,416
your own hand.

1655
02:03:37,416 --> 02:03:40,005
ASHLEY: I know. I'm sorry, Sarenrae.

1656
02:03:40,005 --> 02:03:47,302
MARISHA: So at the top of the morning, as part of
the Heroes' Feast, everyone gets 2d12--

1657
02:03:47,302 --> 02:03:53,284
MATT: 2d10. 2d10 additional hit points to your
maximum.

1658
02:03:53,284 --> 02:03:55,928
MARISHA: And you heal that, as well.

1659
02:03:55,928 --> 02:03:57,764
LAURA: For a day?

1660
02:03:57,764 --> 02:03:59,259
TRAVIS: We roll that right now?

1661
02:03:59,259 --> 02:04:00,751
MARISHA: And you also fill up that, as well.

1662
02:04:00,751 --> 02:04:02,786
ASHLEY: Yay, that's amazing.

1663
02:04:02,786 --> 02:04:04,328
LIAM: That's tight, right there.

1664
02:04:04,328 --> 02:04:08,472
LAURA: Tight!

1665
02:04:08,472 --> 02:04:11,865
LIAM: Yes, thank you for introducing that to
Liam's vocabulary.

1666
02:04:11,865 --> 02:04:15,081
MARISHA: Also, everyone now has advantage on their
wisdom saving throws.

1667
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:17,791
TRAVIS: Just for the day, right?

1668
02:04:17,791 --> 02:04:19,256
MARISHA: For 24 hours.

1669
02:04:19,256 --> 02:04:25,479
MATT: You're immune to poison, immune to diseases,
immune to being frightened, and all wisdom saving

1670
02:04:25,479 --> 02:04:27,094
throws have advantage.

1671
02:04:27,094 --> 02:04:29,707
ASHLEY: Immune to being frightened? All of us?

1672
02:04:29,707 --> 02:04:38,342
MATT: After eating this meal, it instills you with
an extremely powerful nature-based enchantment.

1673
02:04:38,342 --> 02:04:42,895
You feel your physical form given unnatural
heartiness, and the confidence instills your

1674
02:04:42,895 --> 02:04:47,375
entire body. And so you are immune to poison,
immune to disease, immune to frightened, and you

1675
02:04:47,375 --> 02:04:51,129
get advantage on your wisdom saving throws for 24
hours.

1676
02:04:51,129 --> 02:04:53,503
TRAVIS: I ain't afraid of no ghosts

1677
02:04:53,503 --> 02:04:57,048
ASHLEY: The opposite of tryptophan?

1678
02:04:57,048 --> 02:05:03,543
MATT: A very fine, a very expensive meal. All
right. You guys eventually find yourself getting

1679
02:05:03,543 --> 02:05:24,076
to rest. Through the evening's rest, Grog keeping
watch, eventually the weight of the meal comes to

1680
02:05:24,076 --> 02:05:34,247
your form, and you begin to fall asleep. You all
wake up in the morning untouched, unscathed, but

1681
02:05:34,247 --> 02:05:35,680
all asleep.

1682
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,427
TRAVIS: (snoring)

1683
02:05:37,427 --> 02:05:38,448
LIAM: (gasps)

1684
02:05:38,448 --> 02:05:39,880
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1685
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:41,256
ASHLEY: You fell asleep!

1686
02:05:41,256 --> 02:05:47,670
TRAVIS: No! No. It was just so calm that once the
sun came up, I heard you-- I fell asleep.

1687
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:50,520
LAURA: You've got a lot of drool in your beard.

1688
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:57,473
LIAM: I'll take the first watch next time.
Everything's good. No use crying over spilt milk.

1689
02:05:57,473 --> 02:05:58,959
Let's keep going.

1690
02:05:58,959 --> 02:06:01,327
MARISHA: It's good to have a good night's sleep,
though.

1691
02:06:01,327 --> 02:06:05,397
LIAM: Yoink. Thank you. (whoosh)

1692
02:06:05,397 --> 02:06:11,071
TRAVIS: Sorry! Zero... zero!

1693
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:14,665
MATT: Hundred. No progression on your beard.

1694
02:06:14,665 --> 02:06:18,990
TRAVIS: Aw, I thought it was like the lowest roll
you could ever do.

1695
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:25,261
LAURA: Zero means ten. That's a hundred. That's
the best you can do.

1696
02:06:25,261 --> 02:06:27,736
LIAM: The lowest you can get is ten.

1697
02:06:27,736 --> 02:06:28,914
TRAVIS: Shit.

1698
02:06:28,914 --> 02:06:30,129
LIAM: Or 11, really.

1699
02:06:30,129 --> 02:06:33,512
MATT: It's all right. But you still have your
fancy little Lincoln going on.

1700
02:06:33,512 --> 02:06:39,316
TRAVIS: They call me Honest Grog. Like Lincoln?
No?

1701
02:06:39,316 --> 02:06:41,422
TALIESIN: No, I was there. I was with you.

1702
02:06:41,422 --> 02:06:46,857
TRAVIS: Zero, zero! Hundred.

1703
02:06:46,857 --> 02:06:51,967
LAURA: Let's go!

1704
02:06:51,967 --> 02:06:54,862
MATT: All right. You ride up again, you get
yourself back on the path and you progress up the

1705
02:06:54,862 --> 02:07:03,833
pathway. You continue to ride for the next six to
seven or so hours, stopping briefly to eat lunch

1706
02:07:03,833 --> 02:07:06,082
and just get your energy up.

1707
02:07:06,082 --> 02:07:08,078
ORION: Feed Lockheed.

1708
02:07:08,078 --> 02:07:10,092
LAURA: Leftover from the big feast.

1709
02:07:10,092 --> 02:07:17,277
MATT: There's been no change in Lockheed's health
visually yet. But you continue the process. You

1710
02:07:17,277 --> 02:07:22,696
push forward for the remainder of the day,
eventually getting to the end of your second day

1711
02:07:22,696 --> 02:07:29,953
of travel. As the sun is beginning to slowly set,
you watch the direction it's passing and you can

1712
02:07:29,953 --> 02:07:36,392
see now in the distance what appears to be a large
mountain range beginning to appear above the

1713
02:07:36,392 --> 02:07:41,353
breaks in the canopy where you can see part of the
trees begin to part. There are aspects of the sky

1714
02:07:41,353 --> 02:07:46,430
visible. You can see the clouds have regathered;
there's a little bit of sunlight that breaks

1715
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:50,502
through every now and then, you can see just the
general glow of the sky as it pushes over, but you

1716
02:07:50,502 --> 02:07:53,269
do see the edge of a mountain range in the
distance, probably no more than a couple hours of

1717
02:07:53,269 --> 02:07:55,681
travel to get to the actual base of.

1718
02:07:55,681 --> 02:07:58,794
MARISHA: (worried sounds)

1719
02:07:58,794 --> 02:08:02,277
ORION: That wasn't a word.

1720
02:08:02,277 --> 02:08:06,233
TRAVIS: Is that an Ashari song?

1721
02:08:06,233 --> 02:08:12,183
MARISHA: I'm just-- it's just a lot of pressure.
It's good.

1722
02:08:12,183 --> 02:08:15,836
ORION: So how should we approach?

1723
02:08:15,836 --> 02:08:23,778
MARISHA: Well, just. Approach. Like one would.
Approach.

1724
02:08:23,778 --> 02:08:29,381
MATT: You hear a sudden clap of thunder
(thunderclap). Comes rumbling through the sky. And

1725
02:08:29,381 --> 02:08:34,850
you can see, above the mountain range, the clouds
that are gathering are very dark, and a roiling

1726
02:08:34,850 --> 02:08:39,948
thunderstorm is starting to break over the
mountain range. You see flashes of light from

1727
02:08:39,948 --> 02:08:43,060
within, and a few other claps of thunder rolling
over the mountain range.

1728
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:44,875
LAURA: Does it look natural?

1729
02:08:44,875 --> 02:08:49,068
MATT: It looks like a thunderstorm. It's not
ominously dark more than what you're used to, but

1730
02:08:49,068 --> 02:08:51,119
it looks like there is a thunderstorm blowing
through.

1731
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:58,758
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check, see how long
it's going to hang out? Ooh, 17, that's 27.

1732
02:08:58,758 --> 02:09:10,215
MATT: You take a moment and watch it. It is
stationary. Taking a very close look, it doesn't

1733
02:09:10,215 --> 02:09:20,229
appear to be pouring any rain. It's just a thick
gathering of black thunderclouds that has yet to

1734
02:09:20,229 --> 02:09:22,408
release its watery payload.

1735
02:09:22,408 --> 02:09:32,933
LAURA: What do you think, Keyleth? Does it look
safe to traverse?

1736
02:09:32,933 --> 02:09:39,210
MARSHA: It just formed, right? We watched it
happen?

1737
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:42,725
MATT: As you approached and noticed, you could see
that the storm is there.

1738
02:09:42,725 --> 02:09:46,077
ORION: Apparently, your people have a taste for
the theatrics.

1739
02:09:46,077 --> 02:09:48,430
LAURA: Do you think that's where they are?

1740
02:09:48,430 --> 02:09:55,435
MARISHA: I drop to my knees, and I do Commune With
Nature.

1741
02:09:55,435 --> 02:10:07,862
MATT: As you spend a little time focusing on the
landscape around you. What's the range on that?

1742
02:10:07,862 --> 02:10:11,631
MARISHA: It's big. 5th-level spell.

1743
02:10:11,631 --> 02:10:27,937
MATT: Here we go. Got it. (laugh) All right. So
three miles of you. It's a little bit beyond three

1744
02:10:27,937 --> 02:10:35,596
miles, but you gather at least within the distance
there that-- nothing immediately visible, but the

1745
02:10:35,596 --> 02:10:41,584
temperature, you can gather, gets slightly warmer
as you approach the mountain range. That's the

1746
02:10:41,584 --> 02:10:44,192
most you can gather from this distance.

1747
02:10:44,192 --> 02:10:46,450
MARISHA: Looks like that's the way.

1748
02:10:46,450 --> 02:10:48,929
LIAM: Is it safe to just approach?

1749
02:10:48,929 --> 02:10:56,301
MARISHA: That's what I did with the Earth Ashari,
but I mean, they were welcoming and kind.

1750
02:10:56,301 --> 02:11:00,973
ORION: Maybe they will be, too. You know, maybe
they just like being warm.

1751
02:11:00,973 --> 02:11:04,208
ASHLEY: Do they have a reputation of being--

1752
02:11:04,208 --> 02:11:08,795
MARISHA: We haven't made contact with them in
almost two generations. I don't know. Last time we

1753
02:11:08,795 --> 02:11:14,755
made contact with them it was fine, and everyone
was good, but who knows. It's been a while,

1754
02:11:14,755 --> 02:11:16,998
because my mother didn't come back.

1755
02:11:16,998 --> 02:11:28,538
LIAM: This is maybe awkward, but you and we share
something in common. Our past is awkward. I get

1756
02:11:28,538 --> 02:11:37,050
the sense that yours is not as much. Your people,
are they a mix of many kinds?

1757
02:11:37,050 --> 02:11:44,476
MARISHA: How we came to be-- for all we know; once
again, roughly a thousand years ago-- certain

1758
02:11:44,476 --> 02:11:52,832
people possessed natural abilities. We assumed we
were blessed by the gods of nature, and when we

1759
02:11:52,832 --> 02:11:56,768
realized we had these abilities and then the
Sundering happened, that's when we banded

1760
02:11:56,768 --> 02:12:03,543
together, but it could have been anyone between
humans, elves, there were a few dwarfs, gnomes.

1761
02:12:03,543 --> 02:12:10,415
Mainly humans and elves. So we're primarily-- I
guess you could say mutts. Primarily half-elven,

1762
02:12:10,415 --> 02:12:18,662
but we separated off into our own separate tribes,
so we each developed our own individual cultures,

1763
02:12:18,662 --> 02:12:21,375
even though we came from the same root.

1764
02:12:21,375 --> 02:12:25,061
LIAM: But predominantly a melding of humans and
elves.

1765
02:12:25,061 --> 02:12:33,924
MARISHA: But we're accepting of all races. At
least, the Air and the Earth Ashari are.

1766
02:12:33,924 --> 02:12:39,065
ORION: And I assume they are steeped in tradition,
as well, such as your own people.

1767
02:12:39,065 --> 02:12:45,221
MARISHA: Yes, absolutely. And each tribe has its
own tradition. It's had a lot of time to develop.

1768
02:12:45,221 --> 02:12:52,590
ORION: Oh, I see. I'm going to reach in my-- Dust
of Illusion, and--

1769
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:57,539
(laughter)

1770
02:12:57,539 --> 02:12:59,241
LIAM: Friendly fire!

1771
02:12:59,241 --> 02:13:00,658
ORION: It's okay. It didn't break.

1772
02:13:00,658 --> 02:13:03,081
MATT: That was the day that Orion set himself on
fire.

1773
02:13:03,081 --> 02:13:05,116
TALIESIN: Right here, on camera.

1774
02:13:05,116 --> 02:13:08,259
LIAM: We just hit 7,000 subs when Orion set
himself on fire!

1775
02:13:08,259 --> 02:13:10,157
ORION: It happens all the time when you bend it.

1776
02:13:10,157 --> 02:13:12,084
TALIESIN: (sputtering, laughing)

1777
02:13:12,084 --> 02:13:15,366
ORION: It's fine. We're all okay.

1778
02:13:15,366 --> 02:13:19,299
MARISHA: It touched my ass! It hit me in the ass.

1779
02:13:19,299 --> 02:13:25,236
TALIESIN: There's, like, five jokes I'm not making
right now.

1780
02:13:25,236 --> 02:13:30,833
ORION: And I just sprinkle some on myself, and I
turn my scales silver.

1781
02:13:30,833 --> 02:13:37,615
MATT: Okay. (magic noise) All of your scales shift
into a glistening silver color, that of the same

1782
02:13:37,615 --> 02:13:42,133
scales that the followers of Bahamut had adorned
their armor with when you went to that section of

1783
02:13:42,133 --> 02:13:43,154
Vasselheim.

1784
02:13:43,154 --> 02:13:44,982
ORION: This is the color my brother Faeryn is.

1785
02:13:44,982 --> 02:13:46,238
LAURA: It looks good on you.

1786
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:49,600
LIAM: Yes. So you're a silver-colored dragonborn
now?

1787
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:55,641
ORION: If they are steeped in tradition, the
metallic dragonkin are more welcome in societies,

1788
02:13:55,641 --> 02:13:58,930
more than the chromatic. As we've seen.

1789
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:06,178
LIAM: Judging books by their cover, yes. I ride my
horse around in a circle just to face everybody

1790
02:14:06,178 --> 02:14:16,476
and say, everyone, maybe go a bit back, go behind
Keyleth. Vex'ahlia and I will trail just behind as

1791
02:14:16,476 --> 02:14:18,226
your retinue.

1792
02:14:18,226 --> 02:14:19,606
MARISHA: Sure.

1793
02:14:19,606 --> 02:14:23,006
ASHLEY: Is there anything we can do to help? Or
just make you feel a little bit more at ease?

1794
02:14:23,006 --> 02:14:25,786
MARISHA: I don't know what to expect.

1795
02:14:25,786 --> 02:14:30,122
ORION: I have this Longbottom herb you can smoke
before we go?

1796
02:14:30,122 --> 02:14:33,925
MARISHA: I'm good. I'll wait.

1797
02:14:33,925 --> 02:14:36,233
LIAM: We need her clear, Tiberius.

1798
02:14:36,233 --> 02:14:43,534
MARISHA: See, what I'm most nervous about is, when
I went to the Earth Tribe they said that my mother

1799
02:14:43,534 --> 02:14:54,461
had passed through. And went through her training,
and her Ulare trip, and she was fine. And then

1800
02:14:54,461 --> 02:14:55,988
continued on.

1801
02:14:55,988 --> 02:14:57,965
LAURA: Maybe your mother's still here?

1802
02:14:57,965 --> 02:15:00,638
MATT: (thunder) Another lightning clap.

1803
02:15:00,638 --> 02:15:02,577
TALIESIN: Let's get a move on, I think.

1804
02:15:02,577 --> 02:15:03,844
MARISHA: Okay.

1805
02:15:03,844 --> 02:15:07,334
TRAVIS: Keyleth, we're all here behind you. You've
got this.

1806
02:15:07,334 --> 02:15:13,222
LAURA: We'll pretend to be your small army. You
are our leader.

1807
02:15:13,222 --> 02:15:21,042
MARISHA: Okay. And please, don't mention anything
about us being called the SHITs when we first got

1808
02:15:21,042 --> 02:15:22,188
started.

1809
02:15:22,188 --> 02:15:24,326
ASHLEY: Vox Machina, that's all it is.

1810
02:15:24,326 --> 02:15:36,621
TRAVIS: Wait, is that Kashaw? Made you look. Break
the tension! Never mind, you've got it.

1811
02:15:36,621 --> 02:15:44,360
MATT: You continue riding towards the mountain
range at the base of the Sunder Peak Mountains.

1812
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:51,767
Eventually the forest begins to give way as the
ground itself becomes less and less hospitable to

1813
02:15:51,767 --> 02:15:58,564
vegetation. There's a certain smell to the air
that seems to come through the wind that buffets

1814
02:15:58,564 --> 02:16:07,236
the bottom of the mountain range itself. It smells
like a distant forest fire. Like, you can smell

1815
02:16:07,236 --> 02:16:18,583
almost like burnt cedar, a little bit of ash to
the air. You make your way to the base. Everyone

1816
02:16:18,583 --> 02:16:24,219
roll a perception check.

1817
02:16:24,219 --> 02:16:28,630
LIAM: 15.

1818
02:16:28,630 --> 02:16:30,118
TALIESIN: 17.

1819
02:16:30,118 --> 02:16:34,360
MARISHA: Nervous. 14.

1820
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:35,713
ASHLEY: 17.

1821
02:16:35,713 --> 02:16:36,860
LAURA: 15.

1822
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:37,934
TRAVIS: Eight.

1823
02:16:37,934 --> 02:16:39,011
ORION: 13.

1824
02:16:39,011 --> 02:16:40,097
MARISHA: 14.

1825
02:16:40,097 --> 02:16:46,468
MATT: Okay. Percy. Everyone else, you look about
this mountain range and it's just the sheer edge,

1826
02:16:46,468 --> 02:16:50,532
like there's no real sign, outside from climbing
it up, how you'd manage to find--

1827
02:16:50,532 --> 02:16:51,961
LAURA: Oh! Is it favored terrain?

1828
02:16:51,961 --> 02:16:55,265
MATT: Is mountainous part of your favored
terrain?

1829
02:16:55,265 --> 02:16:56,335
LAURA: Oh, is it still mountains?

1830
02:16:56,335 --> 02:17:02,108
MATT: Yes, these are mountains. You glance up,
though. You notice that there is apparently two

1831
02:17:02,108 --> 02:17:08,249
paths that diverge at the very base. They're very
steep, back and forth switchback winding paths

1832
02:17:08,249 --> 02:17:12,575
that lead up the front of the mountain. It's hard
to see exactly where they lead, because once they

1833
02:17:12,575 --> 02:17:16,603
reach a certain point the rest of the mountain
cliff seems to blend into itself. But you do

1834
02:17:16,603 --> 02:17:23,361
notice there are two maybe five-foot wide, very
thin switchback paths that lead up the side of the

1835
02:17:23,361 --> 02:17:24,391
mountain.

1836
02:17:24,391 --> 02:17:26,484
TALIESIN: Oh look, we have two options for our
ways up.

1837
02:17:26,484 --> 02:17:27,837
LIAM: Two paths, Percy?

1838
02:17:27,837 --> 02:17:33,578
TALIESIN: Two paths. I want to examine the path to
see if there's one that's been more trod.

1839
02:17:33,578 --> 02:17:35,869
LIAM: Let's choose the one less travelled, then.

1840
02:17:35,869 --> 02:17:39,370
TALIESIN: That won't make much of a difference.

1841
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:42,777
MATT: We're cultured.

1842
02:17:42,777 --> 02:17:45,866
(laughter)

1843
02:17:45,866 --> 02:17:48,693
TALIESIN: 14.

1844
02:17:48,693 --> 02:17:55,939
MATT: 14. Glancing at the two sides, the left path
appears to be far more worn. The right path is

1845
02:17:55,939 --> 02:18:02,467
largely untouched, with a thin layer of ash
coating it, so you get the feeling that one hasn't

1846
02:18:02,467 --> 02:18:04,704
seen use in quite some time.

1847
02:18:04,704 --> 02:18:10,365
TALIESIN: Are the prints going both directions, or
is there a majority going one or the other?

1848
02:18:10,365 --> 02:18:19,168
MATT: On the left side, they seem to go both ways,
but even those prints are fairly old. At least a

1849
02:18:19,168 --> 02:18:22,238
week or two has seen any sort of traction on the
path.

1850
02:18:22,238 --> 02:18:24,171
TALIESIN: Footprints, horse prints, both?

1851
02:18:24,171 --> 02:18:25,293
MATT: Footprints.

1852
02:18:25,293 --> 02:18:26,392
TALIESIN: No horse prints.

1853
02:18:26,392 --> 02:18:27,724
MATT: Correct.

1854
02:18:27,724 --> 02:18:30,681
LIAM: What do you see, Percival?

1855
02:18:30,681 --> 02:18:37,572
TALIESIN: I see the path is probably too
treacherous to bring the horses. We might want to

1856
02:18:37,572 --> 02:18:43,670
leave them here. One path has barely been touched,
the other one has been pretty well ridden through.

1857
02:18:43,670 --> 02:18:46,886
I say we take the more common path.

1858
02:18:46,886 --> 02:18:48,619
MARISHA: All right.

1859
02:18:48,619 --> 02:18:53,634
MATT: So you leave your horses behind? Okay.

1860
02:18:53,634 --> 02:18:55,866
LIAM: Are there trees to tie them up?

1861
02:18:55,866 --> 02:18:58,847
MATT: There are some trees towards the edge here.

1862
02:18:58,847 --> 02:19:05,128
LAURA: Wait, why are we taking the more travelled
one? Do you think your family is more reclusive?

1863
02:19:05,128 --> 02:19:15,590
MARISHA: Our tribe, we generally can still make
contact and trade with nearby towns, generally.

1864
02:19:15,590 --> 02:19:18,669
There might be more travelled ones, once again I'm
not sure.

1865
02:19:18,669 --> 02:19:22,420
LIAM: Yeah, the one that Keyleth's people, or
cousins, or whatever they are, have been taking.

1866
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:26,162
MARISHA: Yeah, let's try the path more travelled
first.

1867
02:19:26,162 --> 02:19:32,207
MATT: So you guys leave your horses behind. You
tie them up to one of the nearby trees, one that's

1868
02:19:32,207 --> 02:19:34,577
off to the side, leave a little bit of feed for
them.

1869
02:19:34,577 --> 02:19:36,336
LAURA: We tied them.

1870
02:19:36,336 --> 02:19:44,634
MATT: Okay. You make your way up the switchback
path, up the side of the mountain. It is

1871
02:19:44,634 --> 02:19:50,388
relatively steep. It continues up at about a
40-degree incline, and there are certain moments

1872
02:19:50,388 --> 02:19:57,103
where it tends to pinch to about a two-foot-wide
path, and you have to uncomfortably put your back

1873
02:19:57,103 --> 02:20:03,216
to the side of the mountain to get through those
passes. You're about, I'd say about an hour and a

1874
02:20:03,216 --> 02:20:11,303
half, two hours later, the sun has officially set,
and what little bit of moonlight would be brought

1875
02:20:11,303 --> 02:20:17,410
forth is currently encased by the thunderstorm
ahead, and you do still hear the occasional clap

1876
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:21,789
of thunder and see the occasional flash that
almost seems to be happening above the range, out

1877
02:20:21,789 --> 02:20:23,410
of visual sight.

1878
02:20:23,410 --> 02:20:26,363
LIAM: I think we need light so we don't go over
the edge.

1879
02:20:26,363 --> 02:20:28,029
ORION: Sure. (igniting sound)

1880
02:20:28,029 --> 02:20:32,213
MATT: Tiberius creates a beacon of light at the
edge of his staff, and being centrally located to

1881
02:20:32,213 --> 02:20:37,173
the team, is a fairly good source of visual light
to the pathway. You guys continue to go up the

1882
02:20:37,173 --> 02:20:44,361
side. I'm going to go ahead and have everybody do
a constitution saving throw here.

1883
02:20:44,361 --> 02:20:48,887
MARISHA: Druid dice! Not good.

1884
02:20:48,887 --> 02:20:51,675
ORION: 18.

1885
02:20:51,675 --> 02:20:54,121
TALIESIN: 13.

1886
02:20:54,121 --> 02:20:56,269
MARISHA: Nine.

1887
02:20:56,269 --> 02:20:59,124
LAURA: Nine.

1888
02:20:59,124 --> 02:21:00,418
ASHLEY: 17.

1889
02:21:00,418 --> 02:21:01,700
TRAVIS: 18.

1890
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:14,829
MATT: This isn't a chill-based thing. The air
itself, the wind that's blowing down, is filled

1891
02:21:14,829 --> 02:21:19,149
with this thick ash-type dust that's coming
through here. You're finding yourself coughing.

1892
02:21:19,149 --> 02:21:21,375
It's getting into your lungs a little bit.

1893
02:21:21,375 --> 02:21:24,369
TALIESIN: I've got a mask for this. I'm going to
put on the mask.

1894
02:21:24,369 --> 02:21:27,926
MATT: Okay, you pull your mask down.

1895
02:21:27,926 --> 02:21:29,659
LAURA: I pull my hood up.

1896
02:21:29,659 --> 02:21:38,417
MATT: No immediate effects, but you find yourself
unable to suppress an occasional cough. You

1897
02:21:38,417 --> 02:21:44,320
continue up the side of the mountain. You guys
pull your cloth up over your faces. You make your

1898
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:50,299
way. It's pushing almost midnight at this point in
time, and you're getting tired, your legs are

1899
02:21:50,299 --> 02:21:58,277
growing sore from the constant perpetual walk
upwards at an angle. The path begins to become less of

1900
02:21:58,277 --> 02:22:02,965
a switchback, and you can see it's beginning to
pull inwards towards what looks like a ravine in

1901
02:22:02,965 --> 02:22:10,297
the mountain range. There's an area where the
actual mountain carves inward and leads into the

1902
02:22:10,297 --> 02:22:21,609
mountain range proper. During that time, Vex, as
you guys are making your way up to this slight

1903
02:22:21,609 --> 02:22:28,018
inward path and it starts pushing into the
mountain range, less dangerous and less pressed

1904
02:22:28,018 --> 02:22:32,700
against the mountain as you were previously, you
notice up at the top there are a few shadowed

1905
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:41,217
figures just out of your visual range that you can
just make out over the backlight of the clouds in

1906
02:22:41,217 --> 02:22:42,573
the sky.

1907
02:22:42,573 --> 02:22:44,244
LAURA: Do they look--

1908
02:22:44,244 --> 02:22:52,577
MATT: You can make a perception check.

1909
02:22:52,577 --> 02:23:01,516
LAURA: Fuck. I chose poorly. That's terrible.
Yeah. Eight.

1910
02:23:01,516 --> 02:23:09,704
MATT: Eight. At this distance, it's hard to really
make out any sort of visual on their form, their

1911
02:23:09,704 --> 02:23:16,215
size, but you just see there's a handful of them
and it looks like three figures that are moving in

1912
02:23:16,215 --> 02:23:19,368
unison along the ridge a little ways up ahead of
you guys.

1913
02:23:19,368 --> 02:23:22,361
LAURA: Shut up.

1914
02:23:22,361 --> 02:23:27,495
MATT: Can I go ahead and get a stealth check from
the group? With disadvantage on the ones that

1915
02:23:27,495 --> 02:23:29,699
failed their constitution saves.

1916
02:23:29,699 --> 02:23:31,872
MARISHA: How do we know if we failed?

1917
02:23:31,872 --> 02:23:39,327
MATT: The fail is the nine or below. Yeah. I'll
let you know if it's a fail or not, but you guys,

1918
02:23:39,327 --> 02:23:44,376
everyone has to make a stealth check, and the ones
who currently have the coughs have disadvantage on

1919
02:23:44,376 --> 02:23:45,522
the roll.

1920
02:23:45,522 --> 02:23:47,307
MARISHA: Who has the coughs? How do we know?

1921
02:23:47,307 --> 02:23:49,306
TRAVIS: Your clanging armor didn't do nothing!

1922
02:23:49,306 --> 02:23:53,542
MARISHA: Did I fail? With a nine?

1923
02:23:53,542 --> 02:23:56,071
MATT: With a nine? Yes, you did. You're also
coughing.

1924
02:23:56,071 --> 02:23:58,400
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1925
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:02,614
ORION: 22.

1926
02:24:02,614 --> 02:24:04,650
TALIESIN: 11.

1927
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:05,712
MARISHA: 14.

1928
02:24:05,712 --> 02:24:07,006
MATT: 14?

1929
02:24:07,006 --> 02:24:08,939
TRAVIS: 21.

1930
02:24:08,939 --> 02:24:10,020
LAURA: Whoa.

1931
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:12,229
ASHLEY: 19.

1932
02:24:12,229 --> 02:24:14,205
ALL: Whoa!

1933
02:24:14,205 --> 02:24:17,496
ASHLEY: I have been oiling my armor.

1934
02:24:17,496 --> 02:24:21,207
TRAVIS: She didn't have disadvantage. She rolled a
17 on her constitution.

1935
02:24:21,207 --> 02:24:23,256
MATT: Right, so you were fine.

1936
02:24:23,256 --> 02:24:25,106
LIAM: How did Trinket do?

1937
02:24:25,106 --> 02:24:28,767
LAURA: 15. I did not roll for Trinket for either
of those things.

1938
02:24:28,767 --> 02:24:32,228
MATT: Go ahead and roll stealth on Trinket.

1939
02:24:32,228 --> 02:24:33,876
LIAM: Mighty two.

1940
02:24:33,876 --> 02:24:35,562
TRAVIS: A mighty two.

1941
02:24:35,562 --> 02:24:42,931
LAURA: You're so annoying.

1942
02:24:42,931 --> 02:24:48,695
TRAVIS: You know you don't have to breathe all of
it in every time.

1943
02:24:48,695 --> 02:24:55,467
LIAM: Oh, right, no. 15, sorry, 15. For stealth,
right?

1944
02:24:55,467 --> 02:24:57,100
MATT: For stealth.

1945
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,318
LIAM: (coughs loudly)

1946
02:24:59,318 --> 02:25:03,427
MATT: As you guys make your way into the path and
she points this out, there's a couple people that

1947
02:25:03,427 --> 02:25:07,929
kind of, there's a quiet silence, and then
(coughing) a couple of coughs coming through.

1948
02:25:07,929 --> 02:25:13,963
Shushed as best you can, you can see the figures
shift and then vanish from sight.

1949
02:25:13,963 --> 02:25:18,267
TRAVIS: Should we hurry? What do you think?

1950
02:25:18,267 --> 02:25:23,710
LAURA: Well, they know now.

1951
02:25:23,710 --> 02:25:30,216
MARISHA: I'm going to do a perception check and
see if I can see any sign of a village or a town

1952
02:25:30,216 --> 02:25:33,533
or my people. 23.

1953
02:25:33,533 --> 02:25:39,111
MATT: Looking around, the pathway still continues
upward, and it continues and then disappears over

1954
02:25:39,111 --> 02:25:47,578
a ridge where the mountains come inward to the
closest portion where the mountain range tends to

1955
02:25:47,578 --> 02:25:51,873
break. You can't see anything beyond that, because
it's still too far away from you.

1956
02:25:51,873 --> 02:25:57,119
MARISHA: Knowing my people and my tribe, would I
know if these were centurions?

1957
02:25:57,119 --> 02:26:03,492
MATT: You have no idea. You haven't been to this
territory. You know that centurions usually are

1958
02:26:03,492 --> 02:26:07,965
sent out, and people keep watch on the landscape
around, but you have no idea.

1959
02:26:07,965 --> 02:26:12,557
TRAVIS: Because I know the mountains, are we still
on that crappy narrow precipice?

1960
02:26:12,557 --> 02:26:18,721
MATT: That crappy path is starting to move inward
finally towards the actual mountain; it's starting

1961
02:26:18,721 --> 02:26:24,514
to crest over into the top area, where it goes
into almost more like a ravine where the two walls

1962
02:26:24,514 --> 02:26:27,544
of the mountain come together to give you a small
valley path that leads--

1963
02:26:27,544 --> 02:26:31,540
TRAVIS: Could I look and see if there are any
boulder, avalanche-type situations that I can

1964
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,525
see--

1965
02:26:32,525 --> 02:26:34,000
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

1966
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:41,548
LIAM: Can I clarify something? Am I giving Scanlan
a shoulder-ride right now, or is he knocking boots

1967
02:26:41,548 --> 02:26:43,314
back in Vasselheim?

1968
02:26:43,314 --> 02:26:55,693
MATT: Yeah. Scanlan... paid well for enough
attention to celebrate his current

1969
02:26:55,693 --> 02:27:04,887
non-freezing-death or smashing by a dragon. He's
still recovering through the positive

1970
02:27:04,887 --> 02:27:09,042
reinforcement of numerous female workers.

1971
02:27:09,042 --> 02:27:11,139
LIAM: Yes, I call it a tiefling trio.

1972
02:27:11,139 --> 02:27:13,890
TRAVIS: There's going to be art for that.

1973
02:27:13,890 --> 02:27:17,394
TALIESIN: Don't say things like that out loud.

1974
02:27:17,394 --> 02:27:20,525
MATT: Do you guys continue?

1975
02:27:20,525 --> 02:27:22,337
TALIESIN: I think so.

1976
02:27:22,337 --> 02:27:24,624
LAURA: Can I-- I mean--

1977
02:27:24,624 --> 02:27:26,440
MARISHA: Let's continue on.

1978
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:32,672
MATT: All right. You continue pushing in, and this
area where the mountain range tends to collide to

1979
02:27:32,672 --> 02:27:37,428
this path that then leads on. It's slowly winding
around and heading upward and closer and closer in

1980
02:27:37,428 --> 02:27:44,749
towards where the mountain range crests. There's a
couple more flashes of lightning, some thunder,

1981
02:27:44,749 --> 02:27:46,073
and you all look around.

1982
02:27:46,073 --> 02:27:51,438
ORION: I rolled an 18, because I want to do an
arcana check for anything I can feel from that

1983
02:27:51,438 --> 02:27:52,833
storm.

1984
02:27:52,833 --> 02:28:00,528
MATT: 18. Best you can gather, the storm is
localized, it is not moving, and this type of

1985
02:28:00,528 --> 02:28:06,940
storm seems to be more generated not because there
is a gathering of storm activity or any natural

1986
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:12,050
rain that falls in this area-- and in fact, most
of the rock and landscape you see here is very

1987
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:21,140
dry-- this usually accompanies a place of very
strong power. Natural occurrences where there is a

1988
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:28,114
funnel or focus of some sort of unbridled arcane
or divine energy tends to call this type of

1989
02:28:28,114 --> 02:28:32,249
aberrant weather pattern to it.

1990
02:28:32,249 --> 02:28:39,122
MARISHA: This would sometimes happen at the Air
Ashari, as well. We'd get windstorms occasionally.

1991
02:28:39,122 --> 02:28:40,775
It happens.

1992
02:28:40,775 --> 02:28:46,803
MATT: You hear a strange clacking sound, and you
glance up just in time to see a large boulder

1993
02:28:46,803 --> 02:28:52,797
(booming sounds) down the mountain. So for this
one in particular, this would be towards the

1994
02:28:52,797 --> 02:28:57,149
people that are in front. That would be Keyleth,
Vex, Vax, and Trinket.

1995
02:28:57,149 --> 02:28:58,787
MARISHA: Do I have enough time to react?

1996
02:28:58,787 --> 02:29:01,342
MATT: You guys can go ahead and make a dexterity
saving throw.

1997
02:29:01,342 --> 02:29:03,004
ORION: How big is the boulder?

1998
02:29:03,004 --> 02:29:07,891
MATT: It's roughly six feet in diameter. It
barrels through the vicinity.

1999
02:29:07,891 --> 02:29:10,151
MARISHA: 23.

2000
02:29:10,151 --> 02:29:12,163
MATT: One?

2001
02:29:12,163 --> 02:29:15,648
ORION: Can I try to do something right now?

2002
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:17,890
MATT: We'll let them do the reaction first.

2003
02:29:17,890 --> 02:29:28,153
LAURA: What was my number? It was 13? 13 for me,
and Trinket gets 13, as well.

2004
02:29:28,153 --> 02:29:29,723
MATT: 13 and 13.

2005
02:29:29,723 --> 02:29:31,700
ORION: Can I try and do something?

2006
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:37,000
MATT: As soon as I finish their action, basically
the boulder (smack) and they all tried to dodge

2007
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,922
out of the way, and then you can do your action.

2008
02:29:38,922 --> 02:29:42,559
ORION: I'm going to try to cast Telekinesis, and
(whoosh).

2009
02:29:42,559 --> 02:29:48,532
MATT: Okay. The casting of the spell itself takes
a moment. It's one of those things where it's not

2010
02:29:48,532 --> 02:29:55,223
an instant thing, you have to do the motions for
it. It's not so much instant. However, as the

2011
02:29:55,223 --> 02:30:01,208
boulder manages to roll by, all of you except for
Vax manage to roll out of the way in time.

2012
02:30:01,208 --> 02:30:11,148
Everyone ducked out as the boulder trucks past.
You take 16 points of bludgeoning damage as the

2013
02:30:11,148 --> 02:30:12,914
boulder slams into your side.

2014
02:30:12,914 --> 02:30:13,956
MARISHA: 60?

2015
02:30:13,956 --> 02:30:16,120
MARISHA, MATT, and TALIESIN: 16

2016
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:22,425
MATT: You immediately glance up to the top, and
you can now see three figures have gathered at the

2017
02:30:22,734 --> 02:30:26,188
very top of this ridge, and you can see two more
are lifting boulders.

2018
02:30:26,188 --> 02:30:27,726
TRAVIS: Lifting boulders?

2019
02:30:27,726 --> 02:30:30,009
LAURA: Oh, are they giants? Are they more fucking
giants?

2020
02:30:30,009 --> 02:30:33,612
MATT: Glancing up, best you can see, and
they're about 45 to 50 feet up on this ridge-line.

2021
02:30:33,652 --> 02:30:38,883
They appear to be larger than normal humans. They
are humanoid. You, with your highest perception,

2022
02:30:38,883 --> 02:30:45,165
glance up and you can see each one has two heads
across one set of shoulders. (straining noises)

2023
02:30:45,165 --> 02:30:49,376
LAURA: Can we get in a place that boulders won't
hit us? If we get right up against the cliff

2024
02:30:49,376 --> 02:30:50,224
face?

2025
02:30:50,224 --> 02:30:51,688
MATT: You can certainly try.

2026
02:30:51,688 --> 02:30:53,388
ORION: So now we see that happening?

2027
02:30:53,388 --> 02:30:55,577
MATT: You guys all see this happening now.

2028
02:30:55,577 --> 02:31:00,487
ORION: Cool, so as I see the next one I cast
Telekinesis on the one he's about to throw and

2029
02:31:00,487 --> 02:31:02,548
huck it right back at him.

2030
02:31:02,548 --> 02:31:09,802
MATT: Okay. One of the boulders gets loosed; now
this one's coming towards the bottom group here as

2031
02:31:09,876 --> 02:31:14,511
Tiberius, you reach up and do that. Go ahead and
roll a strength check, with the strength of the

2032
02:31:14,511 --> 02:31:18,788
boulder, which I believe is-- (muttering) What's
the strength check on this boulder?

2033
02:31:18,788 --> 02:31:24,399
MARISHA: How far away are they, roughly?

2034
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:28,364
MATT: They're about 45 to 50 feet up on the
pathway.

2035
02:31:28,364 --> 02:31:33,008
TRAVIS: We could just bolt. We're at the bottom of
the valley.

2036
02:31:33,008 --> 02:31:36,859
MATT: All right, so you just roll and add five.
Roll and add five to your d20.

2037
02:31:36,859 --> 02:31:39,840
ORION: Okay, that was 15.

2038
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:44,855
MATT: 15? He rolled a five, even with his strength
bonus. He throws the boulder down, the boulder

2039
02:31:44,855 --> 02:31:49,653
smacks him right back in the face. You can see he
just (groans) tips over backward out of visual

2040
02:31:49,653 --> 02:31:53,900
range, there are now two of them currently visible
at the top. All right, so go ahead and make your

2041
02:31:53,900 --> 02:31:58,976
attack; the rest of you guys get a round. However,
at this point in time as you guys are preparing, the

2042
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:03,838
second boulder comes crashing down towards the
second half. I need Percy, Pike, Grog, and

2043
02:32:03,838 --> 02:32:06,065
Tiberius to make dexterity saving throws.

2044
02:32:06,065 --> 02:32:09,876
MARISHA: Do you guys want to run?

2045
02:32:09,876 --> 02:32:15,017
ORION: Nope. Got a solid five.

2046
02:32:15,017 --> 02:32:17,766
MATT: Dexterity saving throw. Five?

2047
02:32:17,766 --> 02:32:20,052
LAURA: 14 on the first one.

2048
02:32:20,052 --> 02:32:21,313
TALIESIN: 18.

2049
02:32:21,313 --> 02:32:24,505
MATT: Okay. 14 is fine.

2050
02:32:24,505 --> 02:32:26,101
TRAVIS: 13.

2051
02:32:26,101 --> 02:32:27,430
ASHLEY: 15?

2052
02:32:27,430 --> 02:32:33,393
MATT: 15? Okay. All but Tiberius, you guys dodge
out the way. Tiberius, who's concentrating on the

2053
02:32:33,393 --> 02:32:40,529
Telekinesis-- (impact noise) The secondary
boulder, unfortunately, connects. You take 12

2054
02:32:40,529 --> 02:32:49,317
points of bludgeoning damage. I need you to make a
concentration check. Roll a d20. Add five to it.

2055
02:32:49,317 --> 02:32:51,642
ORION: That's 24.

2056
02:32:51,642 --> 02:32:57,118
MATT: 24? Yeah, you maintain concentration. As it
almost knocks you off your side, you manage to

2057
02:32:57,118 --> 02:33:00,146
(grunts) maintain your focus on the spell; your
Telekinesis is still going.

2058
02:33:00,146 --> 02:33:02,059
LAURA: I try to hit him with an arrow.

2059
02:33:02,059 --> 02:33:04,690
MATT: Go for it.

2060
02:33:04,690 --> 02:33:06,176
LAURA: 16.

2061
02:33:06,176 --> 02:33:10,351
MATT: 16 hits. You go (flying arrow) you loose it
and it goes hurtling up the side through the

2062
02:33:10,351 --> 02:33:14,086
darkness and it finds purchase somewhere in the
face of the entity. Go ahead and roll damage.

2063
02:33:14,086 --> 02:33:18,415
LAURA: Yeah! 17.

2064
02:33:18,415 --> 02:33:19,947
MATT: 17, nice.

2065
02:33:19,947 --> 02:33:21,684
LAURA: I didn't Hunter's Mark him.

2066
02:33:21,684 --> 02:33:25,051
TALIESIN: Is the entity still lifting boulders?

2067
02:33:25,051 --> 02:33:29,537
MATT: There are two entities currently that are
still up. One you can't see because it got the

2068
02:33:29,537 --> 02:33:31,651
boulder smashed back into its face.

2069
02:33:31,651 --> 02:33:36,253
TRAVIS: As much as I like being targets for their
lawn bowling, we are in the bottom of a fucking

2070
02:33:36,253 --> 02:33:37,247
valley.

2071
02:33:37,247 --> 02:33:38,966
MARISHA: Yeah, we're in a death pit, man.

2072
02:33:38,966 --> 02:33:40,278
ASHLEY: Run.

2073
02:33:40,278 --> 02:33:45,853
MATT: You guys just run? Okay. You start bolting
forward (heavy steps). You can see the two

2074
02:33:45,853 --> 02:33:49,588
entities now reach over and grab rocks and start
running.

2075
02:33:49,588 --> 02:33:50,965
ASHLEY: Run zig-zags!

2076
02:33:50,965 --> 02:33:56,164
MARISHA: I turn around where they are right in
front and throw up a big Wall of Stone.

2077
02:33:56,164 --> 02:34:02,484
MATT: They both throw boulders overhead, now
arcing, missing the entire ravine trying to get it

2078
02:34:02,484 --> 02:34:03,514
downward.

2079
02:34:03,514 --> 02:34:04,739
ORION: Is my thing still going?

2080
02:34:04,739 --> 02:34:05,855
MATT: Your Telekinesis is still going, yeah.

2081
02:34:05,855 --> 02:34:07,466
ORION: I'm going to catch one and (whoosh).

2082
02:34:07,466 --> 02:34:09,119
MARISHA: Don't take out my Wall of Stone!

2083
02:34:09,119 --> 02:34:10,479
ORION: No, I'm going to whack the dude.

2084
02:34:10,479 --> 02:34:16,947
MATT: One of them rolls down, and it would have
impacted except for the Wall of Stone, it hits--

2085
02:34:16,947 --> 02:34:25,515
let me see the strength of that-- oh, it rolled a
one on its strength. The boulder slams right at

2086
02:34:25,515 --> 02:34:29,747
the bottom of the ravine, gets even more speed as
it ramps up like a bowling ball and slams into the

2087
02:34:29,747 --> 02:34:33,216
stone wall. The stone wall (impact noise) heaves
and cracks, and portions of it fall and collapse,

2088
02:34:33,216 --> 02:34:38,214
but it does manage to stop the force of that
boulder. The second one comes overhead towards

2089
02:34:38,214 --> 02:34:41,238
you. Go ahead and make a d20 roll and add five to it.

2090
02:34:41,238 --> 02:34:42,934
ORION: 19.

2091
02:34:42,934 --> 02:34:49,358
MATT: 19? Yeah, I rolled an eight. You manage to
(straining) catch the boulder. It's just on the

2092
02:34:49,358 --> 02:34:53,183
cusp of the weight limit you would have on
Telekinesis, but you manage to stop it in mid-air

2093
02:34:53,183 --> 02:34:56,534
and catch it. You're just throwing it off to the
side?

2094
02:34:56,534 --> 02:34:58,851
ORION: No, I'm going to huck it right back to the
other guy again! (swish, whoosh)

2095
02:34:58,851 --> 02:35:03,463
MATT: Okay. It's a heavy boulder and it's a long
50-foot distance away so I'm going to go ahead and

2096
02:35:03,463 --> 02:35:06,063
have you roll another d20 plus five.

2097
02:35:06,063 --> 02:35:09,658
ORION: That's 14.

2098
02:35:09,658 --> 02:35:14,523
MATT: 14. You manage to stop it from crushing your
party, and you throw it up and it manages to roll

2099
02:35:14,523 --> 02:35:18,774
up the side, get partway up, and then continue
arcing and rolling down. Away from you guys,

2100
02:35:18,774 --> 02:35:21,552
safely. Skee ball style.

2101
02:35:21,552 --> 02:35:22,916
MARISHA: Running!

2102
02:35:22,916 --> 02:35:26,484
LAURA: I pat Tiberius on the back as I pull him
along. Run!

2103
02:35:26,484 --> 02:35:30,802
MATT: You guys keep running. You notice as you're
bolting forward, the two entities that are

2104
02:35:30,802 --> 02:35:32,490
looming reach over and--

2105
02:35:32,490 --> 02:35:37,205
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to stop, if I see one
pick up a ball, I'm going to stop and take an

2106
02:35:37,205 --> 02:35:38,471
action, if that's okay.

2107
02:35:38,471 --> 02:35:39,611
MATT: Sure, go for it.

2108
02:35:39,611 --> 02:35:43,549
TALIESIN: I'm going to swing around, I'm going to
pull Bad News out as I swing around, back myself

2109
02:35:43,549 --> 02:35:48,772
down, and I'm taking an aimed shot at its arm.

2110
02:35:48,772 --> 02:35:50,645
MATT: Okay, go for it. You're spending a grit
point?

2111
02:35:50,645 --> 02:36:00,372
TALIESIN: Spending a grit point. It's been so
long. There we are. Yeah! Oh, the curse is broken,

2112
02:36:00,372 --> 02:36:03,374
that's 29, 31.

2113
02:36:03,374 --> 02:36:05,383
MATT: 31. Definitively hits.

2114
02:36:05,383 --> 02:36:07,180
TALIESIN: 31.

2115
02:36:07,180 --> 02:36:13,063
MATT: What does the arm shot do? It's no damage,
right?

2116
02:36:13,063 --> 02:36:17,476
TALIESIN: The arm shot is-- okay, sorry. It's been
a while. I've never done this one before. No

2117
02:36:17,476 --> 02:36:20,436
damage, but it drops one item of my choice.

2118
02:36:20,436 --> 02:36:26,342
MATT: So as it's lifting the boulder, you fire,
and it hits the elbow out from under it.

2119
02:36:26,342 --> 02:36:30,808
TALIESIN: And I use the strength of the shot to
pick myself up and keep on running.

2120
02:36:30,808 --> 02:36:38,387
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. So as
one of them is lifting a giant boulder--

2121
02:36:38,387 --> 02:36:39,593
TALIESIN: 23.

2122
02:36:39,593 --> 02:36:44,839
MATT: 23? You're fine. Percy swings around, fires
Bad News. That echoes through the entire ravine,

2123
02:36:44,839 --> 02:36:49,226
(echoing gunshot) acting as a sound focus. You
hear it echoing outward from the blast that sends

2124
02:36:49,226 --> 02:36:54,717
Percy back, but Percy turns around, throws his arm
down on the ground, and using the momentum from

2125
02:36:54,717 --> 02:36:58,768
the blast picks himself up, leaps onto his feet,
and continues running in time with the rest of

2126
02:36:58,768 --> 02:37:04,116
you, a trail of smoke billowing behind him from
the barrel of Bad News, which you can see is now

2127
02:37:04,116 --> 02:37:09,380
glowing with a bit of red warmth, the metal itself
heated from the sheer force of the blast. At this

2128
02:37:09,380 --> 02:37:13,295
time, you look up and see one of the entities with
the two heads is lifting a boulder over its head.

2129
02:37:13,295 --> 02:37:17,891
One of its elbows (gunshot) out from under it
(collapsing sound) as it collapses onto its head,

2130
02:37:17,891 --> 02:37:24,646
and that one also falls out of view as the other
one looks back and sets the boulder down. Starts

2131
02:37:24,646 --> 02:37:27,529
shaking its fists at the air (angry grunting).

2132
02:37:27,529 --> 02:37:29,205
MARISHA: (laughs) Rabble rabble.

2133
02:37:29,205 --> 02:37:32,505
TRAVIS: In Giant I call back, fuck you!

2134
02:37:32,505 --> 02:37:34,190
MATT: In Giant?

2135
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:37,855
TRAVIS: I don't know if it is a giant. It had two
heads.

2136
02:37:37,855 --> 02:37:39,753
TALIESIN: That felt really good.

2137
02:37:39,753 --> 02:37:48,769
MATT: You recognize the echoing voice, it says,
"Come back here, food!" But you shout that back at

2138
02:37:48,769 --> 02:37:58,123
it. It goes, "Hey!" You guys have just charged. At
which point, the ravine begins to open into what

2139
02:37:58,123 --> 02:38:09,286
looks like a-- let me get a little out of this
chaos here-- the ravine opens up into a valley. It

2140
02:38:09,286 --> 02:38:17,636
looks like the top of this mountain range, the top
crested area surrounds this valley that slowly

2141
02:38:17,636 --> 02:38:22,101
descends into the center of this large mountain.
You guys have walked up the outside of it.

2142
02:38:22,101 --> 02:38:23,633
ORION: A hidden valley.

2143
02:38:23,633 --> 02:38:28,879
ASHLEY: Hidden Valley ranch. Sorry, it sounds so
stupid.

2144
02:38:28,879 --> 02:38:35,817
(laughter)

2145
02:38:35,817 --> 02:38:45,393
MATT: The valley itself is roughly three miles
across to the other side of this crested mountain

2146
02:38:45,393 --> 02:38:46,266
range.

2147
02:38:46,266 --> 02:38:47,419
MARISHA: Three miles?

2148
02:38:47,419 --> 02:38:55,142
MATT: Yeah. You notice this valley is actually a
settled-in, bowl-like caldera. You realize this

2149
02:38:55,142 --> 02:39:02,767
particular mountain was once, or possibly still
is, an active volcano. As you begin to move in

2150
02:39:02,767 --> 02:39:07,168
closer, the ground itself becomes more and more
jagged, with what looks like broken obsidian rock,

2151
02:39:07,168 --> 02:39:17,151
sharp volcanic stone and glass. It is a very warm
heat that this area tends to give off, and the

2152
02:39:17,151 --> 02:39:21,493
temperature is now significantly causing you to
sweat. Not just from the run, but the severe

2153
02:39:21,493 --> 02:39:24,832
change in temperature from what you're used to in
this area of the continent.

2154
02:39:24,832 --> 02:39:30,402
ORION: This feels great to me. I'm stretching out
my scales, letting the heat in. Oh yeah, that's

2155
02:39:30,402 --> 02:39:31,662
good.

2156
02:39:31,662 --> 02:39:39,009
MATT: The air, now, the burning wooden ash smell
is becoming much stronger, and you re-adjust your

2157
02:39:39,009 --> 02:39:44,239
cloth to cover your mouth. You also, as you begin
to push closer and closer towards the center, you

2158
02:39:44,239 --> 02:39:51,792
begin to see occasional pools of ashy mud dotting
the landscape, where sulfurous gas caused the

2159
02:39:51,792 --> 02:39:54,571
liquid earth to bubble and fume in certain
patches.

2160
02:39:54,571 --> 02:39:56,825
ORION: Lady Keyleth, is that you? Oh, it's--

2161
02:39:56,825 --> 02:40:00,859
ASHLEY: Oh, are we--?

2162
02:40:00,859 --> 02:40:04,737
MATT: Everyone go ahead and roll perception.

2163
02:40:04,737 --> 02:40:08,579
ORION: As they are doing this with their noses,
I'm going to open my bottle of air and just have

2164
02:40:08,579 --> 02:40:11,144
it (soft spraying sound).

2165
02:40:11,144 --> 02:40:14,879
MARISHA: Ooh! 28.

2166
02:40:14,879 --> 02:40:16,370
TALIESIN: 15.

2167
02:40:16,370 --> 02:40:17,492
ASHLEY: 13.

2168
02:40:17,492 --> 02:40:22,507
LAURA: 12, man.

2169
02:40:22,507 --> 02:40:24,254
LIAM: One.

2170
02:40:24,254 --> 02:40:25,795
LAURA: What is our rolls tonight?

2171
02:40:25,795 --> 02:40:32,038
MARISHA: Twinsies. Twinsies rolls.

2172
02:40:32,038 --> 02:40:34,542
ORION: That is a negative two.

2173
02:40:34,542 --> 02:40:36,177
MATT: (laughing) Okay!

2174
02:40:36,177 --> 02:40:37,875
ORION: There, see?

2175
02:40:37,875 --> 02:40:40,726
LIAM: Take that, game, take that.

2176
02:40:40,726 --> 02:40:47,788
MATT: Far off in the distance, Keyleth, as the
rest of you look at the landscape, you see what

2177
02:40:47,788 --> 02:40:52,519
looks like a small forest, a very localized forest
right in the center of the valley. You can see a

2178
02:40:52,519 --> 02:40:59,122
cluster of trees that exists about a mile, a mile
and a half away from your current position. As you

2179
02:40:59,122 --> 02:41:05,826
guys continue pushing forward, you start seeing
larger stone clusters and formations, almost like

2180
02:41:05,826 --> 02:41:13,128
a very violent activity were forcing and jutting
up portions of stone out of this caldera at some

2181
02:41:13,128 --> 02:41:14,217
point.

2182
02:41:14,217 --> 02:41:20,143
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if it's
natural, from earthquakes, or if earthbenders have

2183
02:41:20,143 --> 02:41:22,079
done it? 25.

2184
02:41:22,079 --> 02:41:27,268
MATT: Looking at it, it appears that a lot of it
appears to be natural, but there are portions that

2185
02:41:27,268 --> 02:41:36,288
appear to be sculpted or have sections that are
cleaved off or taken by possible tools for use of

2186
02:41:36,288 --> 02:41:38,696
building or other purposes.

2187
02:41:38,696 --> 02:41:41,306
MARISHA: And most of it appears to be obsidian?

2188
02:41:41,306 --> 02:41:47,143
MATT: Obsidian, volcanic rock, which is very
porous and light and somewhat brittle in

2189
02:41:47,143 --> 02:41:53,032
places, and occasionally you see sections of
glass, smooth glass that fill pockets across the

2190
02:41:53,032 --> 02:42:08,130
ground. As you get about half a mile to
three-quarters of a mile into this caldera,

2191
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:13,616
towards that forest you were seeing in the
distance, there is a loud grinding of stone out of

2192
02:42:13,616 --> 02:42:21,565
nowhere, this (grinding) sound. All of you glance
around as suddenly (whooshing) a series of stone

2193
02:42:21,565 --> 02:42:26,529
walls rise out of the ground, surrounding you.
Front, back, side to side, and a fifth one closes

2194
02:42:26,529 --> 02:42:31,277
the top off. You are now left in complete
darkness, imprisoned in what seems to be some sort

2195
02:42:31,277 --> 02:42:32,688
of a stone cube.

2196
02:42:32,688 --> 02:42:33,691
ORION: What? (Light sound effect)

2197
02:42:33,691 --> 02:42:34,821
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

2198
02:42:34,821 --> 02:42:36,333
ORION: Sorry.

2199
02:42:36,333 --> 02:42:37,875
LAURA: Really bright in here.

2200
02:42:37,875 --> 02:42:43,131
MATT: As you look around indeed, relatively
rough-looking stone walls have completely

2201
02:42:43,131 --> 02:42:48,642
encapsulated you guys on all five sides. You are
all entirely trapped inside the structure about 40

2202
02:42:48,642 --> 02:42:50,543
feet high and 40 feet across.

2203
02:42:50,543 --> 02:42:52,496
LAURA: We dig? We dig down? Can we dig?

2204
02:42:52,496 --> 02:42:57,150
ORION: I think a Fireball can do this-- no I'm
just kidding.

2205
02:42:57,150 --> 02:43:00,580
TRAVIS: I take the warhammer, activate it and run
up towards the walls and swing as hard as I can

2206
02:43:00,580 --> 02:43:02,149
into one of the walls.

2207
02:43:02,149 --> 02:43:06,686
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a strength check.

2208
02:43:06,686 --> 02:43:08,606
TRAVIS: (strained wince)

2209
02:43:08,606 --> 02:43:10,162
ASHLEY: Can I assist?

2210
02:43:10,162 --> 02:43:13,182
MATT: (laughs) If you want to. You rush up with
you mace, as well.

2211
02:43:13,182 --> 02:43:14,651
TRAVIS: 19.

2212
02:43:14,651 --> 02:43:16,750
ASHLEY: Oh, you don't need assistance.

2213
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:20,532
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do. From Pike, anytime.

2214
02:43:20,532 --> 02:43:23,586
LAURA and ASHLEY: Nine.

2215
02:43:23,586 --> 02:43:27,884
MATT: So the two of you together slam your 
weapons into the side of the wall, a portion of

2216
02:43:27,884 --> 02:43:32,383
the stone cracks a little and chips fall out, but
the stone still stands pretty solidly.

2217
02:43:32,383 --> 02:43:34,496
LIAM: Everybody stop! Keyleth!

2218
02:43:34,496 --> 02:43:36,660
MARISHA: Can I see through it where they chipped
away?

2219
02:43:36,660 --> 02:43:40,186
MATT: Where they chipped away, there's still more
stone behind. You're not sure how thick these

2220
02:43:40,186 --> 02:43:41,534
walls are.

2221
02:43:41,534 --> 02:43:43,885
LIAM: We just wait or Keyleth talks. Wait.

2222
02:43:43,885 --> 02:43:49,938
MATT: About a moment later, you see a small red
glow appear from a portion of the wall on the

2223
02:43:49,938 --> 02:43:57,102
opposite side. Red glow, looking like a portion of
the stone, about this wide, begins to glow bright

2224
02:43:57,102 --> 02:44:08,586
red before dripping off molten, leaving a small
slit. You can now see through the slit, a few

2225
02:44:08,586 --> 02:44:17,737
heads appearing as one steps into, eyes, shifting,
peering through the small space. "You trespass

2226
02:44:17,737 --> 02:44:24,449
"into our home. I will ask you once your business
before we let the mountain's fury take you."

2227
02:44:24,449 --> 02:44:33,446
MARISHA: Please. I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari,
and I am here to further my Aramente.

2228
02:44:33,446 --> 02:44:39,498
MATT: He looks back for a second. Go ahead and
make a persuasion roll with advantage.

2229
02:44:39,498 --> 02:44:41,981
LIAM: I kneel down toward Keyleth.

2230
02:44:41,981 --> 02:44:43,856
LAURA: And I bow.

2231
02:44:43,856 --> 02:44:46,035
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2232
02:44:46,035 --> 02:44:49,078
MARISHA: And I look around and I'm like--

2233
02:44:49,078 --> 02:44:50,591
MATT: So?

2234
02:44:50,591 --> 02:44:51,893
MARISHA: Persuasion?

2235
02:44:51,893 --> 02:44:53,158
MATT: With advantage.

2236
02:44:53,158 --> 02:44:54,947
LAURA: Can we assist?

2237
02:44:54,947 --> 02:44:56,156
LIAM: We're doing it.

2238
02:44:56,156 --> 02:45:00,466
MARISHA: Persuasion's not good. Ten.

2239
02:45:00,466 --> 02:45:03,950
ORION: I don't bow. I'm still at her side.

2240
02:45:03,950 --> 02:45:13,074
MATT: You guys have all kneeled around her. There
is a moment where they all look about themselves.

2241
02:45:13,074 --> 02:45:27,350
"So, Keyleth of the Air Ashari, you know of our
people, you trek up here with a group of strangers

2242
02:45:27,350 --> 02:45:38,234
"at your sides, welcome weapons at the ready. I ask
you, for the Aramente, whom do you call family?

2243
02:45:38,234 --> 02:45:42,308
"Whom gave you to this world?"

2244
02:45:42,308 --> 02:45:54,137
MARISHA: My father, Korren, and my mother, Vilya.
My mother was my predecessor. Wait, no, that's--

2245
02:45:54,137 --> 02:45:55,596
right? Yes, predecessor.

2246
02:45:55,596 --> 02:45:57,264
ORION: Yes, your Highness.

2247
02:45:57,264 --> 02:46:04,256
MARISHA: She followed in my path. I'm following in
her path.

2248
02:46:04,256 --> 02:46:06,528
MATT: The eyes have now moved away from the slot.

2249
02:46:06,528 --> 02:46:11,530
MARISHA: Damn it. God, I'm so bad at being
eloquent.

2250
02:46:11,530 --> 02:46:18,132
MATT: A moment later, you hear a large
(stone crushing), a large impact sound and a voice

2251
02:46:18,132 --> 02:46:20,059
say, "Stand back!"

2252
02:46:20,059 --> 02:46:21,095
LAURA: How?

2253
02:46:21,095 --> 02:46:22,262
ASHLEY: For what?

2254
02:46:22,262 --> 02:46:24,136
TRAVIS: We all back up.

2255
02:46:24,136 --> 02:46:28,871
MATT: As you all back away, the front wall of
stone that was put up before you, that the eyes

2256
02:46:28,871 --> 02:46:35,251
were looking through, suddenly (crashing) crumbles
into a pile on its own, revealing the caldera

2257
02:46:35,251 --> 02:46:40,858
before you, once again. There stand about ten
individuals, all dressed in what looks like dark

2258
02:46:40,858 --> 02:46:49,013
brown and black hides and leathers, with sections
of what looks like obsidian-tipped weapons,

2259
02:46:49,013 --> 02:46:55,302
certain arrows are cocked at the ready against the
rest of you, and one individual, the one that was

2260
02:46:55,302 --> 02:47:00,501
speaking to you earlier comes forward. You see all
of these people, they are from varying races:

2261
02:47:00,501 --> 02:47:08,202
dwarves, halflings, humans, about three half-elves
among them, when an elven man comes forth, and you

2262
02:47:08,202 --> 02:47:12,083
recognize through the eyes and the tone of voice,
this is the one that spoke to you through the slit

2263
02:47:12,083 --> 02:47:20,469
in the stone. He has no hair. Completely bald of
all hair. Tattooed darkness around his eyes and

2264
02:47:20,469 --> 02:47:27,451
you can see his entire left arm is covered in a
long-healed but horrible burn scar. He steps up

2265
02:47:27,451 --> 02:47:35,533
and gives you a nod of affirmation. "Then you
shall tell this to the Flamespeaker. If you are

2266
02:47:35,533 --> 02:47:39,819
"indeed Ashari, he will know what to do with you.
Come with us."

2267
02:47:39,819 --> 02:47:42,906
MARISHA: And what, might I ask, is your name?

2268
02:47:42,906 --> 02:47:49,785
MATT: Glances back over his shoulder. "Calhoun.
But I'm not the one you wish to speak with."

2269
02:47:49,785 --> 02:47:52,866
ORION: Hi, I'm Tiberius Stormwind.

2270
02:47:52,866 --> 02:47:57,736
MATT: He turns around and continues walking back
towards the forest.

2271
02:47:57,736 --> 02:48:00,783
MARISHA: Let me do all the talking this time.

2272
02:48:00,783 --> 02:48:03,436
LAURA: Would you like us to follow you, Your
Majesty?

2273
02:48:03,436 --> 02:48:09,367
MARISHA: Oh, you don't-- yes, family, my brothers
and sisters.

2274
02:48:09,367 --> 02:48:11,280
LAURA: Got it.

2275
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:18,327
MATT: You guys continue walking alongside Keyleth,
and as you do, most of the druids flank you to

2276
02:48:18,327 --> 02:48:22,698
each side, about four of them, with arrows still
drawn, walking behind you as you progress. They

2277
02:48:22,698 --> 02:48:25,547
are still armed and keeping a close eye on you as
you travel.

2278
02:48:25,547 --> 02:48:27,326
LAURA: This is really not necessary.

2279
02:48:27,326 --> 02:48:29,343
MARISHA: Just let them do it.

2280
02:48:29,343 --> 02:48:38,678
MATT: Calhoun leads the way and you guys continue
traveling for about half an hour or so until

2281
02:48:38,678 --> 02:48:42,137
eventually you begin to reach an area where you
see more of these rock structures, but many of

2282
02:48:42,137 --> 02:48:48,625
them have been carved out, or a series of stones
have been gathered to build small huts and abodes.

2283
02:48:48,625 --> 02:48:53,281
You can see this is essentially a village built
from all the materials that were scavenged from or

2284
02:48:53,281 --> 02:48:59,165
brought to this caldera to construct Pyrah, the
realm of the Fire Ashari.

2285
02:48:59,165 --> 02:49:06,173
As you move through the town, silence still claims
the entirety of the druids that are escorting you,

2286
02:49:06,173 --> 02:49:10,913
with Calhoun leading the way. You can see other
druids begin coming out of their abodes, glancing

2287
02:49:10,913 --> 02:49:16,570
around and watching you as you approach. No
scowls, no smiles, just a general air of

2288
02:49:16,570 --> 02:49:21,757
indifference amongst them as they carefully watch
the strange outsiders stepping through their

2289
02:49:21,757 --> 02:49:27,915
homestead. You are then led through the village to
the outskirts of this forest. Now, the forest you

2290
02:49:27,915 --> 02:49:34,501
see, as you get closer, all the trees are long
dead and petrified. There is not a leaf among

2291
02:49:34,501 --> 02:49:41,432
them, and most of the wood you see is either gray
or black from being charred, burned, or dying over

2292
02:49:41,432 --> 02:49:49,335
time and being petrified. As you head towards the
edge of the forest, Calhoun stops and turns around

2293
02:49:49,335 --> 02:49:56,914
and just crosses his arms and stares at you.

2294
02:49:56,974 --> 02:49:59,522
"Sh."

2295
02:49:59,588 --> 02:50:05,159
At which point, the ground (explosion) shudders
and you can see, in the distance, from within the

2296
02:50:05,159 --> 02:50:16,630
forest almost, you see a large spray of molten
rock disappear into the loose canopy of the burned

2297
02:50:16,630 --> 02:50:22,382
trees before you, some sort of brief volcanic
eruption seems to have sprayed out from the center

2298
02:50:22,382 --> 02:50:30,823
of this cluster of dead trees. About 20 seconds
later, you see a shape begin to emerge from the

2299
02:50:30,823 --> 02:50:39,008
dead forest. Stepping out of the shadows, you see
a man standing there. Human, very thick, sturdy

2300
02:50:39,008 --> 02:50:48,539
build. No shirt, brass-colored bracers, long,
billowing pants of a deep maroon color, with gold

2301
02:50:48,539 --> 02:50:57,117
trim and designs. His skin is very darkened,
whether by blood or by sun. He has a very dark

2302
02:50:57,117 --> 02:51:07,827
complexion to him. His hair is long and jet black.
You see his jaw is very square, and his cold black

2303
02:51:07,827 --> 02:51:15,464
eyes show no emotion as he ignores the rest of you
and steps toward Keyleth. (heavy footsteps) He

2304
02:51:15,464 --> 02:51:18,620
walks right up to you. Now he's looking down at
you. He's standing probably a good foot and a half

2305
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:27,181
taller. Once again, no emotion, no expression.
"You are kin of Vilya, are you?"

2306
02:51:27,181 --> 02:51:31,386
MARISHA: I'm... King of Vilya?

2307
02:51:31,386 --> 02:51:32,487
ORION: Kin.

2308
02:51:32,487 --> 02:51:35,568
MARISHA: Oh, kin of Vilya. Yes, I am.

2309
02:51:35,568 --> 02:51:47,118
MATT: "I am Cerkonos, the Flamespeaker of Pyrah,
the guardian of this rift. Welcome to Pyrah, my

2310
02:51:47,118 --> 02:51:52,885
"child. I must ask: why have you come?"

2311
02:51:52,885 --> 02:51:58,381
MARISHA: I am here to complete my Aramente. I have
already been to the Earth tribe.

2312
02:51:58,381 --> 02:52:01,215
MATT: He crosses his arms for a moment.

2313
02:52:01,215 --> 02:52:06,193
MARISHA: My mother, Vilya, never returned to
Zephra.

2314
02:52:06,193 --> 02:52:13,425
MATT "For you to be here on your Aramente, it is
proof that she did not complete hers, or at least

2315
02:52:13,425 --> 02:52:18,510
"is no longer with us. I am sorry. She was strong
of heart."

2316
02:52:18,510 --> 02:52:20,597
MARISHA: So she came through here?

2317
02:52:20,597 --> 02:52:27,841
MATT: "She did. She completed the trial, the
challenges, and moved on to continue her Aramente

2318
02:52:27,841 --> 02:52:32,272
"about ten or so years back."

2319
02:52:32,272 --> 02:52:41,741
MARISHA: Only ten years ago! She's been gone for
close to 20.

2320
02:52:41,741 --> 02:52:45,216
LAURA: How long was she here?

2321
02:52:45,216 --> 02:52:47,368
MARISHA: Yes, how long was she here?

2322
02:52:47,368 --> 02:52:58,812
MATT: "She stayed naught but three or four days...
and then her journey took her. I'd hoped wherever

2323
02:52:58,812 --> 02:53:00,519
"she was, she was safe."

2324
02:53:00,519 --> 02:53:07,423
LAURA: Can I check him to see if he is telling the
truth? 22.

2325
02:53:07,423 --> 02:53:19,162
MATT: He seems stern, but honest. His words,
genuinely, come from a place of worry and a tinge

2326
02:53:19,162 --> 02:53:27,974
of regret at the knowledge that he's just received.
"Your mother was strong of heart and was very

2327
02:53:27,974 --> 02:53:35,713
"fierce. She could stir the heart of the mountains
themselves with a word. She was very well

2328
02:53:35,713 --> 02:53:38,582
"respected amongst us."

2329
02:53:38,582 --> 02:53:42,588
MARISHA: She was better than I am.

2330
02:53:42,588 --> 02:53:52,887
MATT: "I hope not." At this moment his face
becomes a little darker and he says, "Korren? I

2331
02:53:52,887 --> 02:53:54,480
"assume he is well?"

2332
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:56,831
MARISHA: He is. As stubborn as always.

2333
02:53:56,831 --> 02:54:04,013
MATT: (laughs) "Well, you come with compatriots.
You trust them?"

2334
02:54:04,013 --> 02:54:12,175
MARISHA: Yes. These are my traveling companions,
Vox Machina. They've proven themselves time and

2335
02:54:12,175 --> 02:54:16,592
time again. We've been together for almost over a
year now.

2336
02:54:16,592 --> 02:54:19,249
MATT: "Do you trust them?"

2337
02:54:19,249 --> 02:54:22,491
MARISHA: I do. We actually have a keep now in
Emon.

2338
02:54:22,491 --> 02:54:33,971
MATT: "Good. You'll need trust. You are here to
learn, then, for your Aramente. To be tested, yes?"

2339
02:54:33,971 --> 02:54:35,837
MARISHA: Correct.

2340
02:54:35,837 --> 02:54:43,328
MATT: "Then speak what you've learned to seek,
what you wish to learn. What do you lack? What

2341
02:54:43,328 --> 02:54:46,284
"will be your death?"

2342
02:54:46,284 --> 02:54:58,018
MARISHA: I have actually seen a vision of my
death. From not having the will to do what is

2343
02:54:58,018 --> 02:55:06,338
necessary, for fear of harming others, instead of
protecting myself.

2344
02:55:06,338 --> 02:55:20,037
MATT: "Then the test begins now, without
preparation. Do you also wish to join her in this

2345
02:55:20,037 --> 02:55:21,346
"task?"

2346
02:55:21,346 --> 02:55:23,924
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

2347
02:55:23,924 --> 02:55:31,612
MATT: For the first time, you see a smile across
his face. Beneath it, you can see the gleaming,

2348
02:55:31,612 --> 02:55:42,237
white, toothy grin of the man that acknowledges
some sort of honor. "Then the trial shall

2349
02:55:42,237 --> 02:55:50,390
"commence. Come, within Cindergrove." He turns
around and heads back into the forest. The rest of

2350
02:55:50,390 --> 02:55:54,889
the druids have stepped back now. They've left you
to your own devices.

2351
02:55:54,889 --> 02:55:58,523
TRAVIS: A vision of your death?

2352
02:55:58,523 --> 02:56:08,018
MARISHA: Part of one of the ceremonies that the
Earth tribe gives is called the Alore ceremony.

2353
02:56:08,018 --> 02:56:14,960
It's a tea that they make that is derived from a
local plant that-- It's essentially a vision quest

2354
02:56:14,960 --> 02:56:31,762
tea; it gives you visions. It's a cultural
tradition, I guess. I saw two paths. One was an

2355
02:56:31,762 --> 02:56:46,297
older woman, who was wise and hardened and brave,
and she had a line of young Ashari behind her. And

2356
02:56:46,297 --> 02:56:59,945
I ran away. I feel like she was me. And I ran
away, and I went down another path. There was a

2357
02:56:59,945 --> 02:57:15,375
tree. It was young, but strong, and it had a
familiarity. As I reached out and touched it, my

2358
02:57:15,375 --> 02:57:23,147
vision was taken through the path of the roots,
and I could see the world, and I could see how

2359
02:57:23,147 --> 02:57:34,772
everything was connected, and it took me to you
all. And you were strong and fighting and proud,

2360
02:57:34,772 --> 02:57:51,435
and then Vax yelled out, "This one is for
Keyleth!" I wasn't with you. And then Grog yelled

2361
02:57:51,435 --> 02:58:02,632
out, "This is for our princess!" And it broke
away, and I realized that I was that tree, and it

2362
02:58:02,632 --> 02:58:11,708
was my death. And as I ran to the other side, I
went back to the old woman, and all of my people

2363
02:58:11,708 --> 02:58:24,033
slowly started fading behind her, and as she
looked at me, she said, "Your future is as

2364
02:58:24,033 --> 02:58:42,849
"important as it is fragile. Protect it." And she,
too, faded away. I realized she was me. And when I

2365
02:58:42,849 --> 02:58:55,759
came out of my vision, I talked with the Earth
Headmaster Patisse, and she told me that if I was

2366
02:58:55,759 --> 02:59:04,069
going to survive, I needed to have the will to do
what was necessary, and the strength. And ever

2367
02:59:04,069 --> 02:59:18,387
since the child, it's been hard. I was there for a
long time at the Earth Tribe, longer than most

2368
02:59:18,387 --> 02:59:25,531
stay on their Aramente. I couldn't get through the
trial; every time I used a natural magic, every

2369
02:59:25,531 --> 02:59:33,397
time I tried to fight, I just saw flashes of that
child's eyes. I was blocked. Normally, they save

2370
02:59:33,397 --> 02:59:39,378
the Alore ceremony for the final testament, but
they actually started me with the Alore ceremony

2371
02:59:39,378 --> 02:59:55,987
in order to help hopefully unlock my spiritual
blocking that I was having. But I don't know...

2372
02:59:55,987 --> 02:59:59,116
ORION: So what now, Your Highness?

2373
02:59:59,116 --> 03:00:08,623
MARISHA: Continue on and hope I don't make a fatal
mistake. Hope that I can learn.

2374
03:00:08,623 --> 03:00:11,185
ORION: We won't let that happen.

2375
03:00:11,185 --> 03:00:14,153
MARISHA: I hope I don't let you guys down.

2376
03:00:14,153 --> 03:00:16,598
TALIESIN: We face this together.

2377
03:00:16,598 --> 03:00:23,572
MATT: (explosion) There's another shake of the
ground as you see another spray of molten rock,

2378
03:00:23,572 --> 03:00:29,062
(spraying) and you hear pattering in the distance
of the forest.

2379
03:00:29,062 --> 03:00:35,679
LAURA: We'll do this together.

2380
03:00:35,679 --> 03:00:39,423
TRAVIS: We're with you to the end.

2381
03:00:39,423 --> 03:00:43,036
MARISHA: I love you all.

2382
03:00:43,036 --> 03:00:53,963
MATT: You all move together into the Cindergrove
forest, pushing through the hardened, blackened

2383
03:00:53,963 --> 03:01:00,083
tree trunks to the left and the right of you. The
actual floor of the forest, what appears to be

2384
03:01:00,083 --> 03:01:06,644
piles and piles of burnt-away brush, ash, and
whatever else once was considered life amongst the

2385
03:01:06,644 --> 03:01:12,846
boughs of these trees when they grew there.
Eventually, you find your way to the center of the

2386
03:01:12,846 --> 03:01:19,897
forest, and you can see now the source of these
molten rock sprays. There is a large crevasse

2387
03:01:19,897 --> 03:01:26,188
bisecting the center of the forest, about 35 to 40
feet across and about five feet wide that is a

2388
03:01:26,188 --> 03:01:34,630
pool of slowly roiling lava. You can see the
actual air around it is heavily warped by this

2389
03:01:34,630 --> 03:01:39,430
intense heat that's being released, and all the
trees that are immediately around it are all

2390
03:01:39,430 --> 03:01:46,823
warped and bent and have been burnt to near lack
of recognition. Standing there, amongst the edge

2391
03:01:46,823 --> 03:01:53,834
of it, is Cerkonos with his arms crossed, trained
on you, Keyleth. You see occasionally a couple of

2392
03:01:53,834 --> 03:02:01,214
bubbles (lava bubbling) in the lava behind him,
and even his form is shifting from behind as the

2393
03:02:01,214 --> 03:02:11,994
air itself ripples and changes. He looks at you
and says, "Sit. Focus. Ask permission."

2394
03:02:11,994 --> 03:02:14,680
MARISHA: I do as he says.

2395
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:23,879
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Roll a
d20. Add your wisdom bonus.

2396
03:02:23,879 --> 03:02:32,470
MARISHA: 27.

2397
03:02:32,470 --> 03:02:39,734
MATT: 27. As you sit down and close your eyes, you
begin to focus your mind towards the center of

2398
03:02:39,734 --> 03:02:45,892
this mountain, the heart of the fire that gives it
its life, and as you all watch, a minute passes of

2399
03:02:45,892 --> 03:02:51,757
silence before suddenly the ground shifts again
and you can see the lava begin to grow more and

2400
03:02:51,757 --> 03:02:54,791
more active, sending off little spittles of rock.

2401
03:02:54,791 --> 03:02:57,398
MARISHA: I push it out and continue to focus.

2402
03:02:57,398 --> 03:03:03,732
MATT: You guys begin to see now the lava is
shifting and beginning to roil and you're almost

2403
03:03:03,732 --> 03:03:07,979
afraid it's going to start bubbling over and fill
the area, and this nervousness grips your heart.

2404
03:03:07,979 --> 03:03:15,298
Especially you, Vax, who had previously had some
unhappy run-ins with molten rock. It's a genuine

2405
03:03:15,298 --> 03:03:19,199
fear that you hadn't quite acknowledged since that
moment, and you begin to feel really uncomfortable

2406
03:03:19,199 --> 03:03:27,599
being this close to this opening. As you continue
to focus, you hear Cerkonos's voice again, calm

2407
03:03:27,599 --> 03:03:43,418
and methodical. "Ask permission." I'd like you to
go ahead and roll a nature check.

2408
03:03:43,418 --> 03:03:44,806
MARISHA: 19.

2409
03:03:44,806 --> 03:03:50,114
MATT: 19. (rock scraping) The ground shifts again.
You can now watch the lava. Strangely enough, it's

2410
03:03:50,114 --> 03:03:57,027
beginning to billow upward but not spill over the
edges of the crevasse. It's actually slowly

2411
03:03:57,027 --> 03:04:03,475
circling. You hear this strange sucking sound,
almost like sludge is being pulled through a tube,

2412
03:04:03,475 --> 03:04:09,068
and the lava beginning to slowly spin and spin.
Cerkonos is still-- the back of him you can only

2413
03:04:09,068 --> 03:04:14,670
imagine is either burnt to a crisp by the sheer
proximity of the heat, but he is unmoved.

2414
03:04:14,670 --> 03:04:22,010
MARISHA: I push it out and continue to focus. Just
focus and meditate on asking permission.

2415
03:04:22,010 --> 03:04:32,367
MATT: "Keyleth of the Air Ashari. Ask permission!"
Go ahead and roll one more wisdom check. d20 plus

2416
03:04:32,367 --> 03:04:41,893
five. This time, with advantage.

2417
03:04:41,893 --> 03:04:51,564
MARISHA: Oh my god, I rolled the same thing twice.
Wisdom, five. 18.

2418
03:04:51,564 --> 03:04:59,516
MATT: 18. At this point, you guys notice one final
shift of the ground, and the trees actually crack,

2419
03:04:59,516 --> 03:05:06,822
and you see bits of broken branch and tree begin
to fall and hit the ground around you. The air is

2420
03:05:06,822 --> 03:05:10,574
beginning to pick up, and even though you try and
cover your face the ash is still pushing through

2421
03:05:10,574 --> 03:05:18,084
and your eyes are starting to hurt. You feel
suddenly this blockage, this tension, like the

2422
03:05:18,084 --> 03:05:23,621
mountain was fighting you, give way. And in that
moment you (gasps) breathe in and open your eyes,

2423
03:05:23,621 --> 03:05:29,773
and you all notice that the lava that has been
slowly circling now (whoosh) pulls down into a

2424
03:05:29,773 --> 03:05:35,063
vortex that disappears into the crevasse and is
now a spinning whirlpool of molten rock in the

2425
03:05:35,063 --> 03:05:41,198
crevasse, as Cerkonos still stands there. Cerkonos
now steps aside and seems to vanish from your

2426
03:05:41,198 --> 03:05:49,973
sight in but an instant, his voice lingering in
the air, saying, "Now, you may enter." Looking

2427
03:05:49,973 --> 03:05:56,713
down, you lean over and you can see this slow
spiral of molten rock. It seems to disappear 15 to

2428
03:05:56,713 --> 03:06:00,472
20 feet below, you cannot see the bottom of it,
and when you try and lean forward the heat is so

2429
03:06:00,472 --> 03:06:05,694
intense that you have to close your eyes; you're
forced to. There is a leap of faith here.

2430
03:06:05,694 --> 03:06:13,505
MARISHA: Before I leap down, I cast Protection
from Flame on myself? Or Protection from Energy,

2431
03:06:13,505 --> 03:06:16,338
and I'm going to use fire.

2432
03:06:16,338 --> 03:06:17,776
MATT: Which gives you fire resistance?

2433
03:06:17,776 --> 03:06:18,975
MARISHA: Gives me fire resistance.

2434
03:06:18,975 --> 03:06:26,262
MATT: Okay, good to know. And then... Keyleth?

2435
03:06:26,262 --> 03:06:34,119
MARISHA: I close my eyes and let myself fall.

2436
03:06:34,119 --> 03:06:39,469
MATT: You guys watch as Keyleth steps forward and
tumbles off the edge, into the vortex of molten

2437
03:06:39,469 --> 03:06:43,527
rock. (whoosh) She's gone.

2438
03:06:43,527 --> 03:06:48,458
LIAM: I look to my sister and grab her by the
shoulder and squeeze. Then I dive in.

2439
03:06:48,458 --> 03:06:50,991
LAURA: Oh, shit. Are we doing this?

2440
03:06:50,991 --> 03:06:55,221
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw, as this is
fighting a very strong fear of yours.

2441
03:06:55,221 --> 03:06:59,613
ASHLEY: Because we had the Heroes' Feast, are we
not frightened?

2442
03:06:59,613 --> 03:07:03,426
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's true. You have
advantage on all of our wisdom saving throws, from

2443
03:07:03,426 --> 03:07:05,328
the Heroes' Feast.

2444
03:07:05,328 --> 03:07:06,654
LIAM: 16.

2445
03:07:06,654 --> 03:07:12,835
MATT: Okay. You shrug it off, and the thought of
your sister, the thought of Keyleth, the thought

2446
03:07:12,835 --> 03:07:17,514
of the moments of connection you guys have had,
you push through that pain and you leap and swan

2447
03:07:17,514 --> 03:07:19,569
dive into the vortex.

2448
03:07:19,569 --> 03:07:21,634
ORION: I cast Stoneskin. (whoosh)

2449
03:07:21,634 --> 03:07:25,046
MATT: You leap off. Tiberius dives in, as well.
All of you guys jump in. You don't need to roll

2450
03:07:25,046 --> 03:07:31,138
anything. It was only because of his fear he had
to. The rest of you leap into this vortex.

2451
03:07:31,138 --> 03:07:38,564
LAURA: Trinket! Jump? Come. I smack him on the
butt, and I jump in after him.

2452
03:07:38,564 --> 03:07:44,228
MATT: And Trinket (roaring) leaps in, looking over
his shoulder at you like, what have you done?!

2453
03:07:44,228 --> 03:07:46,889
LAURA: You're brave! Very brave!

2454
03:07:46,889 --> 03:07:51,433
MATT: As you all individually leap through, it's
interesting. There's a falling sensation, and then

2455
03:07:51,433 --> 03:07:57,985
gravity seems to shift. You're facing downward,
but you feel gravity begin to pull you to the

2456
03:07:57,985 --> 03:08:07,129
side, and your feet find purchase on what seems
like the lava spiral, but it doesn't burn. You

2457
03:08:07,129 --> 03:08:11,817
step on it like it's hard rock, shifting slowly
beneath your feet, where you have to continuously

2458
03:08:11,817 --> 03:08:16,586
change your step, like a slowly rotating tunnel
you're walking through, and you're walking

2459
03:08:16,586 --> 03:08:24,875
downward, downward, this way. And you see light
before you, very bright light, and you move

2460
03:08:24,875 --> 03:08:29,425
towards it and move towards it, and your eyes try
and focus, and you cover your vision, and

2461
03:08:29,425 --> 03:08:34,109
eventually you step out of this tunnel and it
takes a moment for your eyes to focus, and looking

2462
03:08:34,109 --> 03:08:43,381
around you, you see a vast barren wasteland of
black cinders, embers, and ash, for miles and

2463
03:08:43,381 --> 03:08:48,019
miles around you. Thin rivers of lava cut across
the plains like blood splatter.

2464
03:08:48,019 --> 03:08:50,505
MARISHA: Oh my god, we're in the Plane of Fire.

2465
03:08:50,505 --> 03:08:55,564
MATT: The wind blows extremely strongly, and the
atmosphere is dry and nearly unbearably hot, like

2466
03:08:55,564 --> 03:09:03,062
the hottest desert you've ever imagined. An
intolerably blazing sun is coming to rest near a

2467
03:09:03,062 --> 03:09:07,832
distant mountain range, but your eyes catch an
even more distant danger: a black, roiling

2468
03:09:07,832 --> 03:09:13,211
cinderstorm a few miles off, red lightning
flashing within its turbulent ash clouds. It looks

2469
03:09:13,211 --> 03:09:17,582
to be moving away from you, thankfully, but you do
indeed find yourself standing in the center of the

2470
03:09:17,582 --> 03:09:23,728
Elemental Plane of Fire. A voice echoes from
behind you, and you look over your shoulder, and

2471
03:09:23,728 --> 03:09:31,375
you can see there is a circular doorway still held
aloft there, shifting slowly, the vortex you

2472
03:09:31,375 --> 03:09:40,886
stepped out of still locked in place. A voice
says, "Stay together. Follow the footsteps. When

2473
03:09:40,886 --> 03:09:45,675
"you find the stone spire, there you will find your
trial."

2474
03:09:45,675 --> 03:09:55,724
MARISHA: Okay...

2475
03:09:55,724 --> 03:10:01,978
ORION: Just to note: when I cast Stoneskin, I
didn't do the concentration. I let go of the Alter

2476
03:10:01,978 --> 03:10:03,244
Self.

2477
03:10:03,244 --> 03:10:06,064
MATT: Right. That was illusion dust, so it's
fine.

2478
03:10:06,064 --> 03:10:10,951
LAURA: Well, we follow footsteps; I can track
footprints.

2479
03:10:10,951 --> 03:10:20,665
MARISHA: Okay, sure. Yeah. He might mean more
metaphorically. I'm not sure. It could be either.

2480
03:10:20,665 --> 03:10:32,869
It's hard to tell. Can I sit and take a minute to
meditate, and see if I can connect with my mother

2481
03:10:32,869 --> 03:10:40,145
and see if I can find some sort of trace?
Essence?

2482
03:10:40,145 --> 03:10:44,273
MATT: Make another wisdom check.

2483
03:10:44,273 --> 03:10:47,102
LAURA: And I want to use Primeval Awareness.

2484
03:10:47,102 --> 03:11:00,466
MARISHA: I have advantage, right? I'll take that
15. Thank you. It was a one. So that's 28.

2485
03:11:00,466 --> 03:11:06,830
LAURA: Can I use Primeval Awareness to see if
there's any aberrations, celestials, elementals,

2486
03:11:06,830 --> 03:11:16,818
fiends, undead? Any scary things? Dragons? Within
six miles. No. A mile.

2487
03:11:16,818 --> 03:11:28,044
MATT: You sense there is a very, very faint
comfort in this path, so you know it's been walked

2488
03:11:28,044 --> 03:11:33,614
before. You're unable to glean anything beyond
that, but you know you're on the right path, but

2489
03:11:33,614 --> 03:11:39,287
your mother's been gone a long time. Surprising
you've even caught wind of this type of an essence

2490
03:11:39,287 --> 03:11:41,212
lingering.

2491
03:11:41,212 --> 03:11:45,191
MARISHA: Any direction of which way the essence
might be blowing?

2492
03:11:45,191 --> 03:11:53,669
MATT: It's hard to tell. Make an investigation
check. You sense within the mile-- because it's

2493
03:11:53,669 --> 03:11:59,025
not like blips on a radar, you just generally
sense something nearby. In three different

2494
03:11:59,025 --> 03:12:09,957
directions, elemental presence. Strong elemental
presence. You glance up. Very strong elemental

2495
03:12:09,957 --> 03:12:15,985
presence as all of you can see, about a quarter
mile, half mile away, you see there's something

2496
03:12:15,985 --> 03:12:19,289
drifting in the sky that is burning like a
beacon.

2497
03:12:19,289 --> 03:12:20,985
TRAVIS: What.

2498
03:12:20,985 --> 03:12:23,326
MARISHA: It's a fire elemental.

2499
03:12:23,326 --> 03:12:25,061
MATT: What did you roll?

2500
03:12:25,061 --> 03:12:26,142
MARISHA: 16.

2501
03:12:26,142 --> 03:12:31,396
MATT: 16. Glancing about, trying to gather a sense
of direction, you look and notice that there's no

2502
03:12:31,396 --> 03:12:36,584
footsteps. There's no sign of any sort of
stepping. The wind that blows through here, and

2503
03:12:36,584 --> 03:12:40,872
there's a strong wind, and all of you are having
to keep your eyes closed and arms up to try and

2504
03:12:40,872 --> 03:12:45,596
block your vision from the wind. And it is a
perpetual difficulty to even just breathe here.

2505
03:12:45,596 --> 03:12:48,016
Every inhale burns the inside of your lungs.

2506
03:12:48,016 --> 03:12:49,579
ORION: Oh! (pop)

2507
03:12:49,579 --> 03:12:54,423
MATT: There you go. Tiberius has a big old bottle
in his mouth now. Like a magical pacifier, and

2508
03:12:54,423 --> 03:12:58,571
you've got your mask on, which is helping. It is
still very hot here, and under all the armor

2509
03:12:58,571 --> 03:13:03,558
you're wearing, you immediately break into a very
heavy sweat. You notice though that, through your

2510
03:13:03,558 --> 03:13:07,284
investigation and the connection with your mother
and the directional sense, while there are no

2511
03:13:07,284 --> 03:13:14,921
tracks, there are small pools of lava that
progress in a pattern, one that would even

2512
03:13:14,921 --> 03:13:18,173
resemble footsteps of a giant or some sort of
large creature.

2513
03:13:18,173 --> 03:13:25,751
MARISHA: Let's head that way. Let's follow this
lava trail. Looks promising.

2514
03:13:25,751 --> 03:13:27,623
TRAVIS: We're behind you.

2515
03:13:27,623 --> 03:13:32,814
MATT: All right. You guys begin pushing forward,
blazing sun bearing down on you, heading towards

2516
03:13:32,814 --> 03:13:37,526
the direction of these pools of lava, and they
scatter a bit, but there is a general direction

2517
03:13:37,526 --> 03:13:39,632
you are able to follow.

2518
03:13:39,632 --> 03:13:44,748
LAURA: (quietly) There's no way to stealth here,
is there? Cover ourselves in ash or something to

2519
03:13:44,748 --> 03:13:46,734
make us less visible?

2520
03:13:46,734 --> 03:13:48,887
MATT: What are you doing?

2521
03:13:48,887 --> 03:13:53,259
LAURA: Is it possible to cover us in ash and try
to make us less visible to the elementals?

2522
03:13:53,259 --> 03:13:54,781
MATT: You can certainly try.

2523
03:13:54,781 --> 03:13:56,508
MARISHA: Do you have Pass Without a Trace right
now?

2524
03:13:56,508 --> 03:13:59,487
LAURA: I do have Pass Without a Trace. I can cast
that on us.

2525
03:13:59,487 --> 03:14:05,774
MATT: Okay. So you cast Pass Without a Trace on
the group. As you do, the magic pools, a bunch of

2526
03:14:05,774 --> 03:14:10,923
the ashes (whoosh) from the ground surround each
of you, and there's this gentle cloud of ash that

2527
03:14:10,923 --> 03:14:16,479
just tends to drift off your body and perpetually
replace itself from the surrounding terrain. It

2528
03:14:16,479 --> 03:14:22,504
does offer you some blanket of visual obscuring
from any sort of high vantage point or distant

2529
03:14:22,504 --> 03:14:28,028
vantage point. Up close, not so much. I'll have
all of you guys roll a stealth check. With a plus

2530
03:14:28,028 --> 03:14:30,908
ten bonus from the spell.

2531
03:14:30,908 --> 03:14:35,164
LIAM: Cloak of Elvenkind is with advantage; would
that take place here?

2532
03:14:35,164 --> 03:14:37,156
MATT: It would, yes.

2533
03:14:37,156 --> 03:14:38,733
MARISHA: 25.

2534
03:14:38,733 --> 03:14:40,637
TRAVIS: 17.

2535
03:14:40,637 --> 03:14:42,062
TALIESIN: 19.

2536
03:14:42,062 --> 03:14:43,921
ASHLEY: 23.

2537
03:14:43,921 --> 03:14:48,289
MATT: With the disadvantage? Because you have
heavy armor on.

2538
03:14:48,289 --> 03:14:49,738
ASHLEY: Let me do it again.

2539
03:14:49,738 --> 03:14:51,768
TRAVIS: The feast thing? No?

2540
03:14:51,768 --> 03:14:54,222
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

2541
03:14:54,222 --> 03:14:56,885
MATT: But you still get the other one, which is
still good.

2542
03:14:56,885 --> 03:15:00,569
LIAM: Plus ten, 38.

2543
03:15:00,569 --> 03:15:03,600
MATT: (mocking) Oh, I'm such a rogue. What did you
get?

2544
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:05,091
LAURA: 22.

2545
03:15:05,091 --> 03:15:06,388
TALIESIN: 17.

2546
03:15:06,388 --> 03:15:10,194
MATT: All right. As you guys continue moving
forward, the wind still buffeting you to the side,

2547
03:15:10,194 --> 03:15:20,017
you hear this (distant animal screeching). You
glance in the distance and you can see, flying

2548
03:15:20,017 --> 03:15:32,479
through the sky, a very, very large, ancient even,
red-scaled draconic beast. For those who are

2549
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:40,497
familiar with the training, the Elemental Plane of
Fire does seem to be a very prominent home to such

2550
03:15:40,497 --> 03:15:51,002
dragons as the red. You guys notice this and stop
in place and keep low. As time passes, eventually

2551
03:15:51,002 --> 03:16:02,284
it moves past, heading towards the distant
mountain range. Thank god you cast that spell. You

2552
03:16:02,284 --> 03:16:08,800
wait a little while, until it's out of sight and
beyond your vision. You keep pushing forward

2553
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:13,436
another 20 to 30 minutes or so through this
hellish landscape. The heat is starting to get to

2554
03:16:13,436 --> 03:16:20,982
you guys. I need everyone to go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw.

2555
03:16:20,982 --> 03:16:24,304
ORION: 21.

2556
03:16:24,304 --> 03:16:28,081
MARISHA: Do I get anything for having my
protection from fire?

2557
03:16:28,081 --> 03:16:30,568
MATT: I'll say, give you advantage for this.

2558
03:16:30,568 --> 03:16:32,896
TALIESIN: My mask doesn't give me any advantage,
does it?

2559
03:16:32,896 --> 03:16:37,990
MATT: Not for heat. This is the general
atmospheric heat.

2560
03:16:37,990 --> 03:16:39,186
TALIESIN: 11.

2561
03:16:39,186 --> 03:16:40,491
LIAM: 13.

2562
03:16:40,491 --> 03:16:41,762
TRAVIS: 20.

2563
03:16:41,762 --> 03:16:43,235
ASHLEY: 13.

2564
03:16:43,235 --> 03:16:49,013
MATT: You all are feeling the heat starting to get
to you, but currently it doesn't seem to be fully

2565
03:16:49,013 --> 03:16:54,336
affecting you; you get the feeling the longer you
stay here, the more it's going to have an effect

2566
03:16:54,336 --> 03:16:58,416
on you. However, you're still pushing through
without a problem. You push on for another ten

2567
03:16:58,416 --> 03:17:06,335
minutes or so before you come across a few more of
these streams of lava, and there, about 20 to 30

2568
03:17:06,335 --> 03:17:12,538
feet ahead of you, you see a single stone obelisk
that rises out of the ground about 15 feet up, and

2569
03:17:12,538 --> 03:17:19,650
towards the top you see embedded in it a single,
mildly glowing, what looks like a fist- or

2570
03:17:19,650 --> 03:17:24,982
heart-sized ruby that is embedded into it like a
beacon, or a small fiery lighthouse in the center

2571
03:17:24,982 --> 03:17:26,745
of this open plain.

2572
03:17:26,745 --> 03:17:27,861
LAURA: That's pretty.

2573
03:17:27,861 --> 03:17:29,895
MARISHA: That looks like a stone spire to me.

2574
03:17:29,895 --> 03:17:31,468
TRAVIS: Well, it's shiny.

2575
03:17:31,468 --> 03:17:34,574
MARISHA: It's rather shiny, yeah. Let's go there.

2576
03:17:34,574 --> 03:17:42,526
MATT: All right. As you guys approach, stepping
towards the obelisk, around the back of it, make a

2577
03:17:42,526 --> 03:17:51,379
perception check.

2578
03:17:51,379 --> 03:17:52,901
LAURA: 17.

2579
03:17:52,901 --> 03:18:04,185
MATT: All right. So. As you begin to step forward,
you instinctively stop as you see figures step out

2580
03:18:04,185 --> 03:18:09,803
from behind the spire. Three normal humans-- in
fact, immediately you recognize stepping from

2581
03:18:09,803 --> 03:18:16,452
behind it is Cerkonos and two of the other druids
that you had accompany you into this. Cerkonos

2582
03:18:16,452 --> 03:18:22,996
walks towards you, arms still crossed, in front of
the spire. You see his wind being blown to the

2583
03:18:22,996 --> 03:18:29,724
side from the sheer force of the heated winds that
are blowing through this barren landscape. He

2584
03:18:29,724 --> 03:18:37,745
looks about the rest of you. "You've done well.
But there is not much time." And he looks off to

2585
03:18:37,745 --> 03:18:43,398
the side, and you can now see the cinderstorm that
was once heading away has changed course and is

2586
03:18:43,398 --> 03:18:49,022
now making its way in the direction of you and the
spire. You can see it's probably about a half a

2587
03:18:49,022 --> 03:18:53,274
mile to a quarter mile off, and you can see the
red arcing bolts of energy floating through it,

2588
03:18:53,274 --> 03:19:01,077
and it's starting to darken the landscape beneath
it. "Show me what it is you've learned." And with

2589
03:19:01,077 --> 03:19:07,672
that, the form of all three druids suddenly burst
into flames and grow in size, Cerkonos becoming

2590
03:19:07,672 --> 03:19:13,448
astronomically large for even the elementals
you've encountered. Everybody roll initiative.

2591
03:19:13,448 --> 03:19:17,366
(groaning)

2592
03:19:17,366 --> 03:19:21,492
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus ballsacks. All right.

2593
03:19:21,492 --> 03:19:28,519
TALIESIN: Oh, sweet baby Jesus.

2594
03:19:28,519 --> 03:19:31,312
LIAM: Oh, Jesus Ballsacks, who art in heaven.

2595
03:19:31,312 --> 03:19:33,125
LAURA: No. Don't.

2596
03:19:33,125 --> 03:19:36,748
TALIESIN: Does this make you feel better?

2597
03:19:36,748 --> 03:19:39,011
LAURA: Oh no.

2598
03:19:39,011 --> 03:19:44,463
MARISHA: (giggling) Yes.

2599
03:19:44,463 --> 03:19:56,446
TALIESIN: God damn it, Wheaton.

2600
03:19:56,446 --> 03:19:59,630
MARISHA: God damn it, Wheaton. Here.

2601
03:19:59,630 --> 03:20:01,679
ORION: Do you need me to light that on fire again
for you?

2602
03:20:01,679 --> 03:20:03,395
TALIESIN: No, it's going.

2603
03:20:03,395 --> 03:20:06,330
MARISHA: Got to get my dice in order.

2604
03:20:06,330 --> 03:20:08,521
TRAVIS: Oh my god, they're on fire.

2605
03:20:08,521 --> 03:20:11,561
We have walls!

2606
03:20:11,618 --> 03:20:20,361
MATT: Broken, ruined walls that appear from the
landscape. I need... some initiative scores from

2607
03:20:20,361 --> 03:20:21,896
you guys.

2608
03:20:21,896 --> 03:20:23,804
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

2609
03:20:23,804 --> 03:20:30,630
MATT: All right. So we have 25 to 20?

2610
03:20:30,630 --> 03:20:32,906
LAURA: Oh no.

2611
03:20:32,906 --> 03:20:35,289
TALIESIN: Crickets. Crickets have 25 to 20.

2612
03:20:35,289 --> 03:20:38,721
MATT: 20 to 15?

2613
03:20:38,721 --> 03:20:40,010
LIAM: 19.

2614
03:20:40,010 --> 03:20:40,991
ORION: 15.

2615
03:20:40,991 --> 03:20:41,917
LAURA: 18.

2616
03:20:41,917 --> 03:20:43,955
MATT: You had 19? All right.

2617
03:20:43,955 --> 03:20:45,152
LAURA: It's addictive, isn't it?

2618
03:20:45,152 --> 03:20:48,377
LIAM: Yeah, it's fun to say. Thanks, bud.

2619
03:20:48,377 --> 03:20:50,079
MATT: 15 to ten?

2620
03:20:50,079 --> 03:20:51,099
ORION: 15.

2621
03:20:51,099 --> 03:20:56,966
MATT: All right, 15, Tiberius. All right. Ten to
five?

2622
03:20:56,966 --> 03:20:58,853
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Nine.

2623
03:20:58,853 --> 03:21:00,875
TALIESIN: (laughs) Hi!

2624
03:21:00,875 --> 03:21:02,186
ASHLEY: Hi.

2625
03:21:02,186 --> 03:21:03,505
MARISHA: Five!

2626
03:21:03,505 --> 03:21:07,540
MATT: All right, who's left?

2627
03:21:07,540 --> 03:21:08,833
MARISHA: Five.

2628
03:21:08,833 --> 03:21:12,056
TRAVIS: I rolled a one.

2629
03:21:12,056 --> 03:21:14,343
MARISHA: He rolled a one, too.

2630
03:21:14,343 --> 03:21:16,163
TALIESIN: We're sitting here like, is this 
a Cirque du Soleil thing?

2631
03:21:16,163 --> 03:21:19,857
MARISHA: We're like, oh cool! It's fire.

2632
03:21:19,857 --> 03:21:23,156
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Burning Man!

2633
03:21:23,156 --> 03:21:31,079
MATT: Top of the round, Cerkonos in his oversized
fire elemental form darts forward towards the

2634
03:21:31,079 --> 03:21:36,318
center (flame sounds). An unnatural pace of
movement as the flames seem to flicker and dart

2635
03:21:36,318 --> 03:21:42,271
and reform at the foot of the rest of the group,
at which point he brings his arms in and (roaring

2636
03:21:42,271 --> 03:21:48,734
flame) releases a torrent of flame that bursts out
in a 20-foot radius from him, catching all of

2637
03:21:48,734 --> 03:21:49,890
you.

2638
03:21:49,890 --> 03:21:51,989
TALIESIN: We have immunity to what, now?

2639
03:21:51,989 --> 03:21:54,113
TRAVIS: She has immunity.

2640
03:21:54,113 --> 03:22:10,696
MATT: Poison, disease, and fright. All right. I
need everyone to roll a dexterity saving throw.

2641
03:22:10,696 --> 03:22:16,036
ORION: Hey! Internet! There's my natural one.

2642
03:22:16,036 --> 03:22:18,037
LAURA and ASHLEY: No!

2643
03:22:18,037 --> 03:22:20,942
ORION: Suck it. It happens.

2644
03:22:20,942 --> 03:22:23,056
TALIESIN: That's better.

2645
03:22:23,056 --> 03:22:29,070
LIAM: Stealth. Dexterity. Damn it.

2646
03:22:29,070 --> 03:22:32,198
MATT: All right. So. Percy, what did you roll?

2647
03:22:32,198 --> 03:22:33,587
TALIESIN: 15.

2648
03:22:33,587 --> 03:22:34,438
MATT: 15.

2649
03:22:34,438 --> 03:22:36,268
MARISHA: 23. No, 24.

2650
03:22:36,268 --> 03:22:37,538
MATT: Natural one.

2651
03:22:37,538 --> 03:22:38,539
LIAM: 27.

2652
03:22:38,539 --> 03:22:39,527
LAURA: 16.

2653
03:22:39,527 --> 03:22:40,451
ASHLEY: 18.

2654
03:22:40,451 --> 03:22:41,538
TRAVIS: 16.

2655
03:22:41,538 --> 03:22:51,665
MATT: All right. I need everyone who rolled a 16
or higher, raise your hand. Okay, so only Percy

2656
03:22:51,665 --> 03:22:54,934
and Tiberius. All of you guys take 13 points of
fire damage.

2657
03:22:54,934 --> 03:22:57,293
ASHLEY: Who rolled high?

2658
03:22:57,293 --> 03:23:03,588
MATT: Yep, who rolled high. 13 points of fire
damage from the blast outward. Tiberius and Percy,

2659
03:23:03,588 --> 03:23:05,623
you both take 25 points of fire damage--

2660
03:23:05,623 --> 03:23:08,399
ORION: (laughs) Resist. 13 for me, anyway.

2661
03:23:08,399 --> 03:23:09,981
MARISHA: I take half, right?

2662
03:23:09,981 --> 03:23:11,614
MATT: You take half, because of fire resistance.

2663
03:23:11,614 --> 03:23:13,038
TALIESIN: How many points?

2664
03:23:13,038 --> 03:23:19,694
MATT: 25, and you are both set on fire as all of a
sudden your clothing and armor (whoosh) burst into

2665
03:23:19,694 --> 03:23:21,588
flames, and you are considered burning.

2666
03:23:21,588 --> 03:23:23,030
TRAVIS: Burning?

2667
03:23:23,030 --> 03:23:25,855
LAURA: How do you put yourself out?

2668
03:23:25,855 --> 03:23:27,728
MATT: You take an action to put yourself out.

2669
03:23:27,728 --> 03:23:29,897
LIAM: Stop, drop and roll, man.

2670
03:23:29,897 --> 03:23:33,935
MATT: You have to basically take your action, your
whole turn, trying to put the flames out. That

2671
03:23:33,935 --> 03:23:36,994
ends Cerkonos's turn. Vax, you're up.

2672
03:23:36,994 --> 03:23:42,725
LIAM: Keyleth's right up against that elemental in
front of her, right? I'm going to run right behind

2673
03:23:42,725 --> 03:23:43,563
her--

2674
03:23:43,563 --> 03:23:44,749
LAURA: You're on fire.

2675
03:23:44,749 --> 03:23:49,740
LIAM: No, I'm not. I made the save. I click my
boots together and I run up--

2676
03:23:49,740 --> 03:23:56,182
MATT: Did you roll for Trinket, as well? Go ahead
and roll Trinket's roll. So you move up over

2677
03:23:56,182 --> 03:23:57,495
here?

2678
03:23:57,495 --> 03:24:01,281
LAURA: That's good. Trinket definitely saved
that.

2679
03:24:01,281 --> 03:24:05,482
MATT: What did Trinket make? You're behind?

2680
03:24:05,482 --> 03:24:09,025
LIAM: Right, so I'm going to swing up underneath
Keyleth's arm, and then I've already clicked the

2681
03:24:09,025 --> 03:24:13,051
boots, so dagger, dagger... dagger.

2682
03:24:13,051 --> 03:24:17,307
TALIESIN: I like the comma there. The comma really
brought it together.

2683
03:24:17,307 --> 03:24:19,694
MATT: Trinket takes 13 points of fire damage.

2684
03:24:19,694 --> 03:24:22,393
LIAM: So 22 on the first.

2685
03:24:22,393 --> 03:24:26,707
MATT: 22 on the first? That hits.

2686
03:24:26,707 --> 03:24:35,648
LIAM: That hits. All right, there's the sneak
attack right there. This is the Keen Dagger. Good,

2687
03:24:35,648 --> 03:24:48,614
there's ten, plus-- did he make an attack already?
He did, right? Damn it. Ten. 13, 14, 20. 20 points

2688
03:24:48,614 --> 03:24:53,522
of damage on the first strike. Second strike
probably misses. 13.

2689
03:24:53,522 --> 03:24:55,189
MATT: 13 misses, yep.

2690
03:24:55,189 --> 03:24:57,334
LIAM: Third strike is a 19.

2691
03:24:57,334 --> 03:24:58,480
MATT: 19 does hit.

2692
03:24:58,480 --> 03:25:02,145
LIAM: Does hit. All right, and that is nine.

2693
03:25:02,145 --> 03:25:07,018
MATT: Nine damage. Okay. As you (whoosh) swing up,
you hit him with the first dagger, strike and miss

2694
03:25:07,018 --> 03:25:10,799
with the second, and the third one you slam up
into its flaming torso, finding some sort of

2695
03:25:10,799 --> 03:25:17,046
physical purchase and slicing through. However,
with each hit, the fire that bursts back burns

2696
03:25:17,046 --> 03:25:21,347
you. The first hit you take three points of fire
damage, second hit deals six points of fire damage

2697
03:25:21,347 --> 03:25:23,643
to you from hitting it with a melee attack.

2698
03:25:23,643 --> 03:25:25,269
LIAM: So three plus six, total of nine?

2699
03:25:25,269 --> 03:25:30,535
MATT: Total of nine points of fire damage. That
ends your turn, Vax. Vex, you're up.

2700
03:25:30,535 --> 03:25:35,674
LAURA: Okay. Can I back away from him, or am I
going to get hit?

2701
03:25:35,674 --> 03:25:41,283
MATT: No, he does not have that far of a reach.

2702
03:25:41,283 --> 03:25:47,284
LAURA: Okay, so I back up. I'm going to back up
against the wall so I can duck behind it if I need

2703
03:25:47,284 --> 03:26:01,073
to, and I call Trinket with me, for sure. And then
I am going to lightning arrow him? I'm going to

2704
03:26:01,073 --> 03:26:05,734
lightning arrow-- no. Jesus. I Hunter's Mark him!

2705
03:26:05,734 --> 03:26:10,216
MATT: There you go. He is Hunter's Marked.

2706
03:26:10,216 --> 03:26:14,912
LAURA: Now he is surrounded by all of our
friends?

2707
03:26:14,912 --> 03:26:17,629
MATT: Correct. He has three of them currently
surrounding him.

2708
03:26:17,629 --> 03:26:22,697
LAURA: Balls. I'm going to have to Hunter's Mark
one of the little ones, then, and aim for one of

2709
03:26:22,697 --> 03:26:30,755
them. And I'm going to Hail of Thorns them. The
one closest to me.

2710
03:26:30,755 --> 03:26:32,507
MATT: Go for it.

2711
03:26:32,507 --> 03:26:39,129
LAURA: That's a 25!

2712
03:26:39,129 --> 03:26:40,630
MATT: 25 hits.

2713
03:26:40,630 --> 03:26:50,053
LAURA: All right. Why do I already forget what I'm
doing. Normal attack. Okay. 17 for the normal

2714
03:26:50,053 --> 03:26:51,167
attack--

2715
03:26:51,167 --> 03:26:52,564
MATT: Plus Hunter's Mark damage?

2716
03:26:52,564 --> 03:27:00,692
LAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark damage. Six for Hunter's
Mark, and then I get 3d10 for the Hail of Thorns.

2717
03:27:00,692 --> 03:27:01,978
MATT: Go for it.

2718
03:27:01,978 --> 03:27:11,320
LAURA: Okay, that's a ten, that's a ten, this is a
ten. Balls. Ten, 12, 13. 13.

2719
03:27:11,320 --> 03:27:16,971
MATT: 13 points of damage. All right, so as you
come around the wall, release your arrow. As it

2720
03:27:16,971 --> 03:27:21,103
goes through the air, you can see the wood
splinter into a bunch of thorny wood protrusions.

2721
03:27:21,103 --> 03:27:26,016
It slams into the elemental, which then bursts
into the side, you can see its form (whoosh), open

2722
03:27:26,016 --> 03:27:30,644
up from the inside, and then (contracting sound),
reform into an elemental, as the rest of the

2723
03:27:30,644 --> 03:27:35,706
thorns shoot out, (thorns impacting) hitting the
side of the stone pillar to the side of it.

2724
03:27:35,706 --> 03:27:37,851
LAURA: And just one more regular attack.

2725
03:27:37,851 --> 03:27:41,471
MATT: Okay. So it's a bonus action to do the
spell, and then it's first attack hit, boom,

2726
03:27:41,471 --> 03:27:43,189
second attack.

2727
03:27:43,189 --> 03:27:44,179
LAURA: 20!

2728
03:27:44,179 --> 03:27:45,607
(cheering)

2729
03:27:45,607 --> 03:27:47,000
MARISHA: Hot diggity.

2730
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:50,079
MATT: So dice times two.

2731
03:27:50,079 --> 03:27:53,703
LAURA: Oh, that's it? I know.

2732
03:27:53,703 --> 03:28:01,140
MATT: So two damage plus your bonus, plus your
Hunter's Mark. Unless Hunter's Mark's once per

2733
03:28:01,140 --> 03:28:05,235
turn; let me check.

2734
03:28:05,235 --> 03:28:12,992
LAURA: 14 for the second hit. That's a lame
critical.

2735
03:28:12,992 --> 03:28:15,510
LIAM: No, it was fantastic.

2736
03:28:15,510 --> 03:28:21,704
MATT: 14 total? All righty. That ends your turn.
Tiberius, you're up. Beginning of your turn, you

2737
03:28:21,704 --> 03:28:27,586
take five points-- actually, no. You take eight
points of fire damage, reduced by four, for being

2738
03:28:27,586 --> 03:28:28,770
on fire.

2739
03:28:28,770 --> 03:28:34,491
ORION: And I'm like, oh, that tickles. I don't
expend an action to do that, and instead I look at

2740
03:28:34,491 --> 03:28:41,184
the main dude and I'm going to be like, here's
something she taught me. (babbling) And I use a

2741
03:28:41,184 --> 03:28:46,249
scroll, and I'm going to cast Blight (magic sound)
on him.

2742
03:28:46,249 --> 03:28:48,266
MARISHA: I did teach him that.

2743
03:28:48,266 --> 03:28:55,719
ORION: I have two Blight scrolls. I'm reading
super fast. (babbling)

2744
03:28:55,719 --> 03:28:59,934
TRAVIS: Like a cattle auctioneer. (imitates
auctioneer)

2745
03:28:59,934 --> 03:29:04,238
ORION: It's okay. I have something else that's
effective.

2746
03:29:04,238 --> 03:29:15,222
MATT: All right. So you took your four damage from
the fire. You pull out the scroll. First, you need

2747
03:29:15,222 --> 03:29:20,331
to roll to see if you can do the scroll properly,
so go ahead and roll a d20, and add your plus

2748
03:29:20,331 --> 03:29:21,636
five.

2749
03:29:21,636 --> 03:29:24,885
ORION: It's 22.

2750
03:29:24,885 --> 03:29:29,462
MATT: 22, yeah. Not a problem. You take the spell,
you pull out the scroll, read it, and the scroll

2751
03:29:29,462 --> 03:29:33,778
itself you can see is starting to burn on its own
just being pulled out in the heated atmosphere

2752
03:29:33,778 --> 03:29:39,488
that is this Plane of Fire, but before it can burn
entirely, you finish the spell. It disappears in a

2753
03:29:39,488 --> 03:29:43,587
flash of light and ash, and then Blight goes and
takes effect.

2754
03:29:43,587 --> 03:29:47,195
ORION: As I'm going to do that, I'm going to
heighten it, and spend three sorcerer points so

2755
03:29:47,195 --> 03:29:48,656
it gives him disadvantage--

2756
03:29:48,656 --> 03:29:51,420
MATT: I will say, because the Blight spell is a
scroll, you cannot use metamagic. It's magic from

2757
03:29:51,420 --> 03:29:54,236
your bloodstream is what gives you that ability.

2758
03:29:54,236 --> 03:29:55,862
ORION: Fair enough.

2759
03:29:55,862 --> 03:30:00,039
MATT: What's the DC on that?

2760
03:30:00,039 --> 03:30:01,768
ORION: 17.

2761
03:30:01,768 --> 03:30:06,599
MATT: 17. Constitution. Rolled a 16, so no. Does
not make it.

2762
03:30:06,599 --> 03:30:09,106
(cheering)

2763
03:30:09,106 --> 03:30:14,096
ORION: So what I can do, is I can-- if I can't
heighten an initial spell, I can power a spell

2764
03:30:14,096 --> 03:30:18,290
that's already been cast with my sorcerer's point,
right? You can empower a spell?

2765
03:30:18,290 --> 03:30:24,067
MATT: True, but still spells that you've cast from
yourself. The metamagic is how you enhance it as

2766
03:30:24,067 --> 03:30:26,658
you cast it out of yourself. If it's from a
scroll--

2767
03:30:26,658 --> 03:30:37,487
ORION: (counting) 25 damage.

2768
03:30:37,487 --> 03:30:46,647
MATT: 25 damage. Good to know. Boom. You can see
as you finish the scroll reading, some of the

2769
03:30:46,647 --> 03:30:52,694
flames seem to die down and part of its physical
form has a hard time keeping itself in one solid place.

2770
03:30:52,694 --> 03:30:55,730
Parts of it flicker, and then it (growls) angrily
pushes through.

2771
03:30:55,730 --> 03:30:57,396
ORION: Where am I relative to everybody else?

2772
03:30:57,396 --> 03:30:58,571
MATT: You're right here.

2773
03:30:58,571 --> 03:31:02,902
ORION: Okay, cool. What I will do, because I can
do this, is I will quicken spell, and I will spend

2774
03:31:02,902 --> 03:31:08,443
two sorcery points to Misty Step behind where Vex
is. (whoosh)

2775
03:31:08,443 --> 03:31:10,066
MATT: Over there?

2776
03:31:10,066 --> 03:31:12,641
ORION: Yep. And in view of everybody else, where I
can still cast stuff.

2777
03:31:12,641 --> 03:31:14,945
MATT: There? Okay. Cool.

2778
03:31:14,945 --> 03:31:16,860
ORION: That's my turn.

2779
03:31:16,860 --> 03:31:34,902
MATT: All righty. That brings us to these guys'
turn. (flames) Right there. Going to move up

2780
03:31:34,902 --> 03:31:43,783
towards Percy. Coming around the side, is going to
make two touch attacks against you, Percy. That is

2781
03:31:43,783 --> 03:31:46,633
a 13.

2782
03:31:46,633 --> 03:31:48,816
TALIESIN: That misses.

2783
03:31:48,816 --> 03:31:52,230
MATT: And that is a 25, with a 19.

2784
03:31:52,230 --> 03:31:54,341
TALIESIN: 25 definitely hits.

2785
03:31:54,341 --> 03:32:05,665
MATT: Definitely hits, okay. You take 13 points of
fire damage, and you are still on fire, so it does

2786
03:32:05,665 --> 03:32:13,665
not reignite you. You are just on fire in general.
That ends its turn. The other one, however, rushes

2787
03:32:13,665 --> 03:32:21,677
up and it's doing a touch attack against Keyleth
and Vex. Vax, I mean. Sorry. Versus Keyleth, that

2788
03:32:21,677 --> 03:32:24,488
is a 16 versus armor class?

2789
03:32:24,488 --> 03:32:26,759
MARISHA: Miss. 17. (whoosh)

2790
03:32:26,759 --> 03:32:31,552
MATT: That's going to be a 20 versus you.

2791
03:32:31,552 --> 03:32:33,172
LIAM: That hits.

2792
03:32:33,172 --> 03:32:39,646
MATT: All right. Vax, you take 12 points of fire
damage, and your cloak bursts into flame.

2793
03:32:39,646 --> 03:32:41,530
LIAM: Oh, fuck a duck!

2794
03:32:41,530 --> 03:32:47,910
MATT: As you're like, shit, now the fire's
crawling up around you. That brings us to Percy

2795
03:32:47,910 --> 03:32:49,111
and Pike's turn.

2796
03:32:49,111 --> 03:32:52,970
MARISHA: Oh my god. (laughs) Stop, drop and roll!

2797
03:32:52,970 --> 03:32:55,028
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

2798
03:32:55,028 --> 03:32:56,877
TALIESIN: I am on fire, aren't I?

2799
03:32:56,877 --> 03:33:00,065
MATT: Beginning of your turn, you take ten points
of fire damage.

2800
03:33:00,065 --> 03:33:08,332
TALIESIN: God damn it. And it takes an entire
action to put myself out? Can I run? He's going to

2801
03:33:08,332 --> 03:33:09,904
get an attack of opportunity on me.

2802
03:33:09,904 --> 03:33:18,210
MATT: He would get an attack of opportunity on you
if you ran, yeah, but also ranged attacks at point

2803
03:33:18,210 --> 03:33:20,079
blank are at disadvantage, too.

2804
03:33:20,079 --> 03:33:26,049
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. Fuck it. I'm going to run
first, and then put myself out.

2805
03:33:26,049 --> 03:33:28,121
MATT: Okay. So you're running which way?

2806
03:33:28,121 --> 03:33:32,338
TALIESIN: I'm running towards the wall. I'm
getting some distance.

2807
03:33:32,338 --> 03:33:33,333
MATT: Over here?

2808
03:33:33,333 --> 03:33:36,765
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm doing a "stop, drop and
roll" on my way to put myself out.

2809
03:33:36,765 --> 03:33:38,320
MARISHA: Fire safety, kids.

2810
03:33:38,320 --> 03:33:42,250
MATT: Okay. The elemental reaches and strikes.
That is a 21.

2811
03:33:42,250 --> 03:33:44,137
TALIESIN: Damn it! Okay.

2812
03:33:44,137 --> 03:33:50,950
MATT: You take 12 points of fire damage as it just
swings out and hits you in the back. You feel the

2813
03:33:50,950 --> 03:33:55,605
flames now licking beneath your armor. You're
sweating profusely and you feel the burn marks as

2814
03:33:55,605 --> 03:33:58,611
the skin begins to boil and crack beneath the
armor.

2815
03:33:58,611 --> 03:34:01,182
TALIESIN: And you've moved me as far in that
direction as I can go, right?

2816
03:34:01,182 --> 03:34:02,804
MATT: That would be over here.

2817
03:34:02,804 --> 03:34:19,997
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm also going to spend my bonus
action for second wind, because fuck. So that's 19

2818
03:34:19,997 --> 03:34:21,801
points that I gain back.

2819
03:34:21,801 --> 03:34:24,090
MATT: That ends Percy's turn. Pike, what you got?

2820
03:34:24,090 --> 03:34:25,991
ORION: Yes, Pike!

2821
03:34:25,991 --> 03:34:33,294
ASHLEY: Okay. So I have the Frost Brand Sword, so
I'm resistant to fire damage if I'm holding it.

2822
03:34:33,294 --> 03:34:35,443
MATT: Correct. You have half damage from fire.

2823
03:34:35,443 --> 03:34:43,369
ASHLEY: But I would like to use a Guiding Bolt,
because it's a little bit more damage.

2824
03:34:43,369 --> 03:34:52,831
MATT: All righty. Go ahead and roll your Guiding
Bolt attack. Against which guy? These three here

2825
03:34:52,831 --> 03:34:54,100
are visible.

2826
03:34:54,100 --> 03:34:58,698
ASHLEY: Okay. Let's do the guy right there. The
big guy.

2827
03:34:58,698 --> 03:35:08,009
MATT: Big guy right there? Okay. Go ahead and roll
your attack. You add your spell attack modifier to

2828
03:35:08,009 --> 03:35:09,227
it.

2829
03:35:09,227 --> 03:35:12,278
ASHLEY: That's only 15. 15?

2830
03:35:12,278 --> 03:35:17,749
MATT: All right. 15 does hit, yes.

2831
03:35:17,749 --> 03:35:20,028
ASHLEY: Yay! Okay.

2832
03:35:20,028 --> 03:35:30,238
MATT: That's 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack
against it has advantage.

2833
03:35:30,238 --> 03:35:31,595
LAURA: Nice!

2834
03:35:31,595 --> 03:35:33,130
ASHLEY: 11.

2835
03:35:33,130 --> 03:35:40,838
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty. Good to
know. Well done. That's your turn. Do you wish to

2836
03:35:40,838 --> 03:35:44,317
move anywhere, or are you going to stay where you
are, Pike?

2837
03:35:44,317 --> 03:35:48,861
ASHLEY: You know what, so sorry. I was casting
that at a three.

2838
03:35:48,861 --> 03:35:51,623
MATT: As a level 3? So add an additional 2d6 to
it.

2839
03:35:51,623 --> 03:35:55,749
ASHLEY: Yeah, sorry. 18.

2840
03:35:55,749 --> 03:35:58,051
LIAM: Total.

2841
03:35:58,051 --> 03:36:00,239
LAURA and ASHLEY: 18 total.

2842
03:36:00,239 --> 03:36:03,758
MATT: Cool, gotcha. All right. You want to move or
you going to stay where you are, Pike?

2843
03:36:03,758 --> 03:36:05,533
ASHLEY: Where am I at?

2844
03:36:05,533 --> 03:36:07,128
MATT: You're right here.

2845
03:36:07,128 --> 03:36:14,444
ASHLEY: You know what, I'm going to back up. Yeah.
Okay. All right.

2846
03:36:14,444 --> 03:36:19,625
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up. Grog, you're
on deck.

2847
03:36:19,625 --> 03:36:31,253
MARISHA: I look at Cerkonos, and give him a nod,
and I say, okay. And I concentrate, and my entire

2848
03:36:31,253 --> 03:36:34,916
form goes water, and I turn into a water
elemental.

2849
03:36:34,916 --> 03:36:41,788
LIAM: Skadoosh.

2850
03:36:41,788 --> 03:36:43,873
TRAVIS: Badass.

2851
03:36:43,873 --> 03:36:51,294
MARISHA: And then I immediately rush into
Cerkonos's space, and do Whelm.

2852
03:36:51,294 --> 03:36:52,962
MATT: Okay.

2853
03:36:52,962 --> 03:36:57,653
MARISHA: So he has to do a DC 15 saving throw.

2854
03:36:57,653 --> 03:37:00,399
MATT: All righty. Dex?

2855
03:37:00,399 --> 03:37:01,995
MARISHA: Strength.

2856
03:37:01,995 --> 03:37:04,476
TALIESIN: We all look great and lose five pounds.

2857
03:37:04,476 --> 03:37:06,880
LIAM: Everybody's glistening.

2858
03:37:06,880 --> 03:37:09,144
TRAVIS: Our pores look better than they ever
have.

2859
03:37:09,144 --> 03:37:11,403
MARISHA: Sweat it out, guys.

2860
03:37:11,403 --> 03:37:13,336
MATT: He rolls a three.

2861
03:37:13,336 --> 03:37:15,619
(cheering)

2862
03:37:15,619 --> 03:37:21,023
MARISHA: So he does 2d8 plus four bludgeoning
damage. I'm also water elemental, so I believe he

2863
03:37:21,023 --> 03:37:24,796
has water susceptibility, correct?

2864
03:37:24,796 --> 03:37:26,142
MATT: Correct.

2865
03:37:26,142 --> 03:37:35,182
MARISHA: I don't know what that does, but he's got
it. So if it's a large or smaller creature, it is

2866
03:37:35,182 --> 03:37:36,339
also grappled.

2867
03:37:36,339 --> 03:37:39,118
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll damage.

2868
03:37:39,118 --> 03:37:44,797
MARISHA: 2d8. Not bad. 12 plus four. 16.

2869
03:37:44,797 --> 03:37:48,842
MATT: 16 damage, nice. And he is grappled,
currently, as you are swirling around him as this

2870
03:37:48,842 --> 03:37:56,101
vortex of water. As you hit for the attack, you do
take six points of fire damage from being in the

2871
03:37:56,101 --> 03:37:57,436
midst of that flame.

2872
03:37:57,436 --> 03:38:00,151
MARISHA: Does he take extra damage because I'm
water? Because he has water susceptibility?

2873
03:38:00,151 --> 03:38:06,671
MATT: Water susceptibility, essentially, he takes
one point of cold damage on top of that, and if he

2874
03:38:06,671 --> 03:38:09,299
tries to moves away from you, he moves slower.

2875
03:38:09,299 --> 03:38:14,272
ORION: You're swirling water around him right
now?

2876
03:38:14,272 --> 03:38:17,488
MARISHA: It's water versus fire elemental right
now.

2877
03:38:17,488 --> 03:38:22,996
MATT: However, because it is a fire elemental, it
is immune to being grappled. Because it is just

2878
03:38:22,996 --> 03:38:25,506
fire, you can't really grab around it.

2879
03:38:25,506 --> 03:38:32,625
MARISHA: Well, I just football tackle him.
(impact) Water right through his form. Steam rolls

2880
03:38:32,625 --> 03:38:34,588
off of me. (hiss)

2881
03:38:34,588 --> 03:38:38,311
MATT: And it is uncomfortable being in this plane
as a water elemental, but you're pushing through it.

2882
03:38:38,311 --> 03:38:40,232
MARISHA: I take how much? Four damage?

2883
03:38:40,232 --> 03:38:45,862
MATT: That was six damage. Which should be halved,
because you have the resistance still on you, so

2884
03:38:45,862 --> 03:39:01,163
that's three damage to you... You also entered its
space, so you also are on fire. Strangely enough,

2885
03:39:01,163 --> 03:39:03,533
you are a water elemental that's caught fire.

2886
03:39:03,533 --> 03:39:07,598
LIAM: Water.

2887
03:39:07,598 --> 03:39:11,972
MATT: It's strange. The water is steaming, and the
flames are having a hard time rolling. I'm going

2888
03:39:11,972 --> 03:39:21,700
to say... I'm going to say you can't. That's
stupid. A water elemental is not going to catch

2889
03:39:21,700 --> 03:39:27,123
fire. That makes no sense. I'm going to say, for
the sake of this battle, you are immune to being

2890
03:39:27,123 --> 03:39:32,810
set on fire. Fucking water elemental. All right,
that ends your turn. Grog, you're up.

2891
03:39:32,810 --> 03:39:38,689
TRAVIS: I look over, and I see as Vax starts
slashing into the fire beastie, I know this is

2892
03:39:38,689 --> 03:39:47,469
going to hurt, and I go into a rage. And I know
I'm going to burn, but I take my three giant

2893
03:39:47,469 --> 03:39:50,339
swings with my battleaxe.

2894
03:39:50,339 --> 03:39:52,508
MATT: So you're going into full frenzied rage.

2895
03:39:52,508 --> 03:39:55,530
TRAVIS: Frenzied rage. Frenzied rage, if you don't
mind.

2896
03:39:55,530 --> 03:39:58,377
MATT: Certainly. Three strikes at him.

2897
03:39:58,377 --> 03:39:59,607
TRAVIS: 24.

2898
03:39:59,607 --> 03:40:01,132
MATT: 24 hits.

2899
03:40:01,132 --> 03:40:02,058
TRAVIS: 19.

2900
03:40:02,058 --> 03:40:03,434
MATT: Hits.

2901
03:40:03,434 --> 03:40:04,618
TRAVIS: And 24.

2902
03:40:04,618 --> 03:40:07,271
MATT: Hits. Damage on all three.

2903
03:40:07,271 --> 03:40:09,265
TRAVIS: 11.

2904
03:40:09,265 --> 03:40:11,079
MATT: 11 damage.

2905
03:40:11,079 --> 03:40:12,492
TRAVIS: 19.

2906
03:40:12,492 --> 03:40:14,103
MATT: 19 damage.

2907
03:40:14,103 --> 03:40:15,341
TRAVIS: And 12.

2908
03:40:15,341 --> 03:40:21,700
MATT: 12 damage. Great. You strike in, axe
swinging through. It's interesting, because you're

2909
03:40:21,700 --> 03:40:25,743
not hitting physical matter, your axe just swings
through, but you can feel the resistance as it's

2910
03:40:25,743 --> 03:40:30,548
carving through whatever magical essence is
holding this elemental together. Each hit, though,

2911
03:40:30,548 --> 03:40:34,990
the flames shoot out of where you wound it and
blast across your arm and your hand, burning you.

2912
03:40:34,990 --> 03:40:41,339
You take ten damage from the first strike, eight
damage-- and because this is magical, it's not

2913
03:40:41,339 --> 03:40:51,220
reduced. So that's 18, plus another ten. 28 total
points of fire damage from striking at it. All

2914
03:40:51,220 --> 03:40:59,475
right. That ends your turn, Grog. Up to the top of
the round, that's now come to Cerkonos. Cerkonos

2915
03:40:59,475 --> 03:41:09,111
is going to stay right where it is. It's going to
go ahead and make three melee touch attacks. It's

2916
03:41:09,111 --> 03:41:17,488
going to be... probably going to be one against
each of you, actually. So against Keyleth, that is

2917
03:41:17,488 --> 03:41:20,570
a 24 to hit?

2918
03:41:20,570 --> 03:41:22,331
MARISHA: Hits.

2919
03:41:22,331 --> 03:41:31,549
MATT: So that would be 12 points of fire damage,
reduced to six because of your spell, but you're

2920
03:41:31,549 --> 03:41:32,957
not ignited.

2921
03:41:32,957 --> 03:41:34,449
LIAM: Against everyone near him?

2922
03:41:34,449 --> 03:41:41,669
MATT: It's doing an attack against each of you.
It's just reaching out. Cocked dice. That is 18

2923
03:41:41,669 --> 03:41:42,756
against you?

2924
03:41:42,756 --> 03:41:44,739
LIAM: Hell yeah, that hits.

2925
03:41:44,739 --> 03:41:51,785
MATT: All right. You take nine points of fire
damage. And against Grog, that is a natural 20.

2926
03:41:51,785 --> 03:41:55,213
(groaning)

2927
03:41:55,213 --> 03:41:57,020
TRAVIS: Was that a crit?

2928
03:41:57,020 --> 03:41:59,391
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.

2929
03:41:59,391 --> 03:42:02,890
LIAM: There goes that beard.

2930
03:42:02,890 --> 03:42:06,169
TRAVIS: Oh, shut up! Don't tell him that!

2931
03:42:06,169 --> 03:42:09,338
MATT: 22 points of fire damage, and you are set on
fire.

2932
03:42:09,338 --> 03:42:13,083
TRAVIS: The beard is okay, right?

2933
03:42:13,083 --> 03:42:15,473
MATT: Currently, but the flames are licking up the
sides of your shoulders.

2934
03:42:15,473 --> 03:42:20,045
TRAVIS: Oh, come on, man. Have you no mercy?

2935
03:42:20,045 --> 03:42:26,879
LIAM: I made a stupid pun, and you tripped me and
made me eat shit. Enjoy.

2936
03:42:26,879 --> 03:42:34,848
MATT: Cerkonos is going to stay there, just taking
you all on at once. That brings us to Vax. To

2937
03:42:34,848 --> 03:42:37,459
start your turn, you take nine points of fire
damage.

2938
03:42:37,459 --> 03:42:43,348
LIAM: Excellent. That's excellent news. I'm going
to use my bonus action to disengage. I've got

2939
03:42:43,348 --> 03:42:49,539
three things I can do here because of the Boots of
Haste, so use bonus action to disengage. I'm

2940
03:42:49,539 --> 03:42:53,935
going to use one action to run like fuck over to
that wall and jump to the side.

2941
03:42:53,935 --> 03:43:00,136
MATT: It's not an attack. You have a bonus action
and an action. So you can disengage and then move,

2942
03:43:00,136 --> 03:43:01,949
then you have your action.

2943
03:43:01,949 --> 03:43:09,190
LIAM: But I can still move my normal speed, right?
All right, so I'm going to run as far as I can

2944
03:43:09,190 --> 03:43:10,911
towards that wall.

2945
03:43:10,911 --> 03:43:12,377
LAURA: The other wall.

2946
03:43:12,377 --> 03:43:14,465
LIAM: No, that wall.

2947
03:43:14,465 --> 03:43:17,096
MATT: Four, five, six. That'll put you right
there.

2948
03:43:17,096 --> 03:43:19,113
LIAM: And then I'm going to roll on the ground.

2949
03:43:19,113 --> 03:43:22,257
MATT: Okay, you use your action to put out the
flame.

2950
03:43:22,257 --> 03:43:24,087
LIAM: (choked) It's okay, right? The cloak's
okay?

2951
03:43:24,087 --> 03:43:29,633
MATT: The cloak's fine. It's a little burnt, but
it's okay. The flames are gone now. You're no

2952
03:43:29,633 --> 03:43:31,004
longer taking fire damage.

2953
03:43:31,004 --> 03:43:32,235
LIAM: That's my woobie.

2954
03:43:32,235 --> 03:43:33,568
MATT: That's your turn. Vex, you're up.

2955
03:43:33,568 --> 03:43:36,255
TALIESIN: Hey, now. Not cool.

2956
03:43:36,255 --> 03:43:42,256
LAURA: All right, I'm going to lightning arrow? Is
that going to do anything to fire? I'm going to

2957
03:43:42,256 --> 03:43:45,699
lightning arrow the one that I've Hunter's
Marked.

2958
03:43:45,699 --> 03:43:47,419
MATT: All righty.

2959
03:43:47,419 --> 03:43:53,644
LAURA: So that is 19?

2960
03:43:53,644 --> 03:44:03,990
MATT: All righty, so that one right there? All
right, that hits.

2961
03:44:03,990 --> 03:44:12,158
LAURA: Okay. So. Do I do my regular attack on
that, as well, or do I just do the damage from the

2962
03:44:12,158 --> 03:44:13,399
lightning?

2963
03:44:13,399 --> 03:44:17,379
MATT: No. The arrow is no longer there; it is now
just a bolt of lightning halfway through the arc.

2964
03:44:17,379 --> 03:44:19,278
LAURA: Okay. Correct. 4d8.

2965
03:44:19,278 --> 03:44:20,996
MATT: 4d8 damage.

2966
03:44:20,996 --> 03:44:40,198
LAURA: This is so nerve-wracking. (counting) 25 on
the lightning arrow.

2967
03:44:40,198 --> 03:44:46,170
MATT: All righty. Grog, go ahead and make a dexterity
saving throw.

2968
03:44:46,170 --> 03:44:47,443
TRAVIS: 18.

2969
03:44:47,443 --> 03:44:48,860
MATT: 18?

2970
03:44:48,860 --> 03:44:51,167
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on that because I'm
raging?

2971
03:44:51,167 --> 03:44:52,924
MATT: No. What's your spell DC?

2972
03:44:52,924 --> 03:44:54,564
LAURA: Oh, 14.

2973
03:44:54,564 --> 03:44:58,470
MATT: Okay, yeah. So he makes the save, go ahead
and roll 2d8, and he takes half damage.

2974
03:44:58,470 --> 03:45:02,578
LAURA: Oh. I didn't realize you were there, Grog.
I'm sorry, I couldn't see.

2975
03:45:02,578 --> 03:45:05,907
MATT: Within ten feet of it. Every creature within
ten feet of it.

2976
03:45:05,907 --> 03:45:11,311
LAURA: I didn't think that was ten feet. I'm
sorry. Oh good, that's nothing. Two!

2977
03:45:11,311 --> 03:45:16,270
MATT: You take two points of lightning damage as
(flicker) part of the lightning arrow arcs off and

2978
03:45:16,270 --> 03:45:20,361
tickles your shoulder. You barely even notice,
you're raged out and focused on him.

2979
03:45:20,361 --> 03:45:23,118
TRAVIS: Yeah, with the being on fire, it's really
not that bad.

2980
03:45:23,118 --> 03:45:35,412
LAURA: I do another attack out of the
Blood-Seeking Bow. (singing) That's a 27!

2981
03:45:35,412 --> 03:45:37,847
(laughter)

2982
03:45:37,847 --> 03:45:40,461
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) 27!

2983
03:45:40,461 --> 03:45:42,470
MATT: Did Hunter's Mark damage on the last one,
right?

2984
03:45:42,470 --> 03:45:48,352
LAURA: Yes. 16 with Blood-Seeking.

2985
03:45:48,352 --> 03:45:51,476
MATT: Nice. So it's now bleeding.

2986
03:45:51,476 --> 03:45:53,972
LAURA: He's a bleeding fireball.

2987
03:45:53,972 --> 03:45:58,399
MATT: Interesting thing about this. I will
consider bleeding as part of its conditional

2988
03:45:58,399 --> 03:46:03,998
immunities, because it does not have blood. It is a
flaming elemental.

2989
03:46:03,998 --> 03:46:05,739
LAURA: Waste.

2990
03:46:05,739 --> 03:46:08,625
MATT: But it still took damage. You can see now,
the flames of this are starting to flicker a

2991
03:46:08,625 --> 03:46:10,781
little bit; it's having hard time keeping itself
cohesive.

2992
03:46:10,781 --> 03:46:11,990
TRAVIS: On the smaller one?

2993
03:46:11,990 --> 03:46:18,131
MATT: Yeah. That ends your turn, do you want to
move anywhere, you staying there?

2994
03:46:18,131 --> 03:46:28,094
LAURA: I'm going to go around the back of the wall
with Trinket. Oh no, I knocked it down on myself!

2995
03:46:28,094 --> 03:46:31,861
Can I get around to the other side?

2996
03:46:31,861 --> 03:46:34,310
MATT: That's as far as you can get with your run
right now, unfortunately.

2997
03:46:34,310 --> 03:46:35,616
LAURA: Okay, that's cool.

2998
03:46:35,616 --> 03:46:38,185
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Tiberius, you're
up.

2999
03:46:38,185 --> 03:46:43,877
MARISHA: Don't worry about hurting me, if that's
what you're afraid of.

3000
03:46:43,877 --> 03:46:52,137
ORION: Okay. I'm going to scooch my booch closer
to the wall to get quarter cover. I think that'll

3001
03:46:52,137 --> 03:46:56,147
put me in about where I need to be to see all
three of them.

3002
03:46:56,147 --> 03:46:59,861
LIAM: Is that Draconic?

3003
03:46:59,861 --> 03:47:02,135
TRAVIS and LAURA: Scooch my booch.

3004
03:47:02,135 --> 03:47:18,130
ORION: Scooch my boocher. Two, three, four. Okay,
so I'm going to cast-- two, four, six-- Glacial

3005
03:47:18,130 --> 03:47:23,148
Blast (hiss) in the arc to hit all three of them.

3006
03:47:23,148 --> 03:47:26,776
MATT: Hit all three of these guys? What's the arc
on that one?

3007
03:47:26,776 --> 03:47:29,061
ORION: 30 feet?

3008
03:47:29,061 --> 03:47:32,839
MATT: 30-foot arc? Okay, you can get these two.

3009
03:47:32,839 --> 03:47:36,020
ORION: If I have to move, can I move closer to
hit?

3010
03:47:36,020 --> 03:47:41,816
MATT: You'd have to get into melee with this to hit all
three, which would be disadvantage if it's an

3011
03:47:41,816 --> 03:47:43,376
attack roll.

3012
03:47:43,376 --> 03:47:44,802
TRAVIS: Just take the two.

3013
03:47:44,802 --> 03:47:51,954
ORION: I'll take the two. I'll do that. And then,
I'm going to spend three points to heighten the

3014
03:47:51,954 --> 03:47:57,108
spell and that gives them disadvantage on their
saving throw, so I'm going to do that right now.

3015
03:47:57,108 --> 03:47:59,429
MATT: So what's the saving throw? Dex?

3016
03:47:59,429 --> 03:48:00,901
ORION: 17.

3017
03:48:00,901 --> 03:48:04,896
MATT: 17 dex. Okay, go ahead and roll damage, and
it's half damage for that, right?

3018
03:48:04,896 --> 03:48:08,407
ORION: Yeah, if they save.

3019
03:48:08,407 --> 03:48:12,392
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

3020
03:48:12,392 --> 03:48:21,399
ORION: Ten, 18, what's that? 30, 35. 35.

3021
03:48:21,399 --> 03:48:26,575
MATT: 35. Okay. Keyleth and Grog also make
dexterity saving throws.

3022
03:48:26,575 --> 03:48:29,202
TRAVIS: Fair.

3023
03:48:29,202 --> 03:48:31,615
MATT: Two. Fails on Cerkonos.

3024
03:48:31,615 --> 03:48:32,817
MARISHA: 17.

3025
03:48:32,817 --> 03:48:35,094
TRAVIS: 20.

3026
03:48:35,094 --> 03:48:37,559
MATT: That is a natural 17 for the fire elemental,
though; it takes half damage there. So what's the

3027
03:48:37,559 --> 03:48:38,824
total on there?

3028
03:48:38,824 --> 03:48:40,768
ORION: And that was at disadvantage?

3029
03:48:40,768 --> 03:48:53,277
MATT: Oh, disadvantage. Natural 20. Sorry. Well,
it still takes half damage. This elemental, you

3030
03:48:53,277 --> 03:48:57,489
notice its form suddenly (cracking) freeze into
ice, and then shatter.

3031
03:48:57,489 --> 03:48:59,961
(cheering)

3032
03:48:59,961 --> 03:49:04,242
MATT: Below it, you see standing in its place the
druid that was once there, (thud) drops down on

3033
03:49:04,242 --> 03:49:07,815
its knees, and looks up at you with a nod.

3034
03:49:07,815 --> 03:49:09,856
LAURA: We're coming back.

3035
03:49:09,856 --> 03:49:12,706
MATT: What'd you roll? With disadvantage on the
saving throw, guys, by the way.

3036
03:49:12,706 --> 03:49:14,295
MARISHA: Disadvantage?

3037
03:49:14,295 --> 03:49:17,640
TRAVIS: That's worse. 14.

3038
03:49:17,640 --> 03:49:19,154
MARISHA: Four.

3039
03:49:19,154 --> 03:49:23,808
MATT: Both of you guys take 35 points of cold
damage. Cerkonos also takes 35 points of cold

3040
03:49:23,808 --> 03:49:43,666
damage. All right, cool. That's Tiberius's turn.
This druid is going to go ahead and is going to

3041
03:49:43,666 --> 03:49:59,283
transform into an eagle and head back in the path
from where you guys came from. This guy is going

3042
03:49:59,283 --> 03:50:04,288
to move in there and is going to make two strikes
against you, Pike. Natural 20.

3043
03:50:04,288 --> 03:50:06,117
LAURA: No!

3044
03:50:06,117 --> 03:50:10,788
MATT: And that's a natural 18, plus six is 24.
Welcome back.

3045
03:50:10,788 --> 03:50:12,665
(laughter)

3046
03:50:12,665 --> 03:50:17,636
ASHLEY: My armor class is 20, so they both hit
me.

3047
03:50:17,636 --> 03:50:19,693
MATT: That's a natural 18 plus six on top of
that.

3048
03:50:19,693 --> 03:50:21,343
ASHLEY: Point taken!

3049
03:50:21,343 --> 03:50:26,518
MATT: Seven times two, that's 14 plus three. Take
17 points of fire damage from the first strike.

3050
03:50:26,518 --> 03:50:34,126
The second one does... so 14 from both, so total
of 28 points of fire damage, and you are ignited.

3051
03:50:34,126 --> 03:50:38,003
All of a sudden, your armor heats up and you see
flames begin to lick up through the different

3052
03:50:38,003 --> 03:50:41,610
sections of the plate, and the fire elemental is
harrying right on top of you.

3053
03:50:41,610 --> 03:50:45,575
TALIESIN: (singing) Oh, that girl is smoking on
fire--

3054
03:50:45,575 --> 03:50:47,508
ASHLEY: (singing) This girl is on fire!

3055
03:50:47,508 --> 03:50:50,429
(laughter)

3056
03:50:50,429 --> 03:50:53,587
MATT: And with that, it's Percy and Pike's turn.

3057
03:50:53,587 --> 03:50:55,568
TALIESIN: You first or me first?

3058
03:50:55,568 --> 03:50:58,116
MATT: Well, Percy, at the top of your turn--
actually, you both take--

3059
03:50:58,116 --> 03:50:59,932
TALIESIN: No, I put myself out.

3060
03:50:59,932 --> 03:51:01,532
MATT: That's right!

3061
03:51:01,532 --> 03:51:06,585
TALIESIN: Take that soda can pop-topper off me.

3062
03:51:06,585 --> 03:51:09,656
ASHLEY: Oh no, wait! My Frost Brand sword. I'm
resistant to fire damage!

3063
03:51:09,656 --> 03:51:17,341
MATT: Take 14 points of fire damage. You also take
what would be four is now two, so a total of 16

3064
03:51:17,341 --> 03:51:18,749
points of fire damage.

3065
03:51:18,749 --> 03:51:22,049
ASHLEY: 16 points, okay. Wait, so what was it?

3066
03:51:22,049 --> 03:51:23,427
TRAVIS and LAURA: 16.

3067
03:51:23,427 --> 03:51:26,116
LIAM: Reality is malleable here.

3068
03:51:26,116 --> 03:51:31,795
MATT: As the actual protective energies of the
Frost Brand gives this layer of cold across your

3069
03:51:31,795 --> 03:51:36,816
armor and reduces the impact. You're still on
fire, but the fire is doing less damage to you

3070
03:51:36,816 --> 03:51:41,162
physically as the cold is counteracting it. Cool.
Percy, what are you doing?

3071
03:51:41,162 --> 03:51:48,978
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm pulling out the Pepperbox and
I'm taking an ice shot at the little one attacking

3072
03:51:48,978 --> 03:51:59,455
Pike. And I'm going to take a sharpshooter--
that's the wrong dice to roll. I'm going to take a

3073
03:51:59,455 --> 03:52:09,935
sharpshooter bonus for it, so that's a miss.
That's a nine. Actually, no. Shit. God damn it,

3074
03:52:09,935 --> 03:52:14,656
that's a misfire. I'm going to spend an action to
fix that.

3075
03:52:14,656 --> 03:52:17,896
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll the check on that,
if you could.

3076
03:52:17,896 --> 03:52:30,380
TALIESIN: Oh, what is the check on that? That's a
DC 12. Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. I hit my check.

3077
03:52:30,380 --> 03:52:37,701
MATT: You just barely make it. The gun is not
broken. As you spin, you go to fire, and something

3078
03:52:37,701 --> 03:52:41,062
about the trajectory of the bullet is off, and as
you release the trigger, all of a sudden the whole

3079
03:52:41,062 --> 03:52:45,410
front of the barrel (cracking) encases in ice, and
you're like, crap! And you have to chisel the ice

3080
03:52:45,410 --> 03:52:46,410
off.

3081
03:52:46,410 --> 03:52:48,673
TALIESIN: Fire again.

3082
03:52:48,673 --> 03:52:51,086
MATT: Well, it takes an action to try and--

3083
03:52:51,086 --> 03:52:53,314
TALIESIN: No, I looked. It takes an attack.

3084
03:52:53,314 --> 03:52:54,967
MATT: Then yes, you're able to do that.

3085
03:52:54,967 --> 03:52:57,088
TALIESIN: If it goes, then I'm--

3086
03:52:57,088 --> 03:53:01,048
MATT: Then it takes an action to fix it, that's
what it is. Yeah, it's an action to fix a broken

3087
03:53:01,048 --> 03:53:02,115
gun.

3088
03:53:02,115 --> 03:53:05,949
TALIESIN: Yeah. Action to fix a broken gun. Let's
try it again without the sharpshooter bonus.

3089
03:53:05,949 --> 03:53:08,173
Better! 20 to hit.

3090
03:53:08,173 --> 03:53:09,927
MATT: 20 does hit, yes.

3091
03:53:09,927 --> 03:53:17,225
TALIESIN: And I don't get the bonus on that
because I suck. Seven points of damage.

3092
03:53:17,225 --> 03:53:18,826
MATT: Seven points of damage.

3093
03:53:18,826 --> 03:53:21,905
TALIESIN: Rolled a one.

3094
03:53:21,905 --> 03:53:26,729
MATT: Sometimes it works out that way. All right.

3095
03:53:26,729 --> 03:53:34,302
TALIESIN: And I'm going to back off.

3096
03:53:34,302 --> 03:53:40,463
MATT: Cannot use your attack again until an action. It is
an action.

3097
03:53:40,463 --> 03:53:43,580
TALIESIN: It is an action? I thought it was an
action to--

3098
03:53:43,580 --> 03:53:48,473
MATT: It's an action to repair, and then if it
breaks, you cannot use it until you're out of

3099
03:53:48,473 --> 03:53:50,255
combat.

3100
03:53:50,255 --> 03:53:52,178
MARISHA: Did it break?

3101
03:53:52,178 --> 03:53:53,693
TALIESIN: It did break.

3102
03:53:53,693 --> 03:53:58,351
MATT: It didn't break. It jammed, and then it
managed to alleviate that.

3103
03:53:58,351 --> 03:54:01,702
TALIESIN: I would have switched guns, anyways, but
okay, next time. For some reason I thought it was

3104
03:54:01,702 --> 03:54:03,493
an attack action.

3105
03:54:03,493 --> 03:54:08,225
MATT: No worries. That's the downside of the
firearms. So no damage, you don't get your second

3106
03:54:08,225 --> 03:54:10,525
attack off as you take your full action.

3107
03:54:10,525 --> 03:54:14,979
TALIESIN: To fix it, okay. That's fine; it was
shitty damage anyways. Hey, I get to keep the

3108
03:54:14,979 --> 03:54:16,325
bullet.

3109
03:54:16,325 --> 03:54:18,986
MATT: Cool, so that ends Percy's turn. Pike, what
are you doing?

3110
03:54:18,986 --> 03:54:21,225
ASHLEY: Percy, where are you at, in terms of hit
points?

3111
03:54:21,225 --> 03:54:25,021
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm at half. I'm at 56.

3112
03:54:25,021 --> 03:54:30,293
LAURA: He's at 12.

3113
03:54:30,293 --> 03:54:33,620
ASHLEY: I know. He's at 12. Can I get over to
Vax?

3114
03:54:33,620 --> 03:54:38,269
MATT: You'll not be able to get to him.

3115
03:54:38,269 --> 03:54:40,311
LAURA: Sprinter's Boots?

3116
03:54:40,311 --> 03:54:41,917
MATT: You could with your Sprinter's Boots, yeah.

3117
03:54:41,917 --> 03:54:43,067
ASHLEY: Sprinter's Boots.

3118
03:54:43,067 --> 03:54:46,848
MATT: All right, so (whoosh). You get by there.
The fire elemental does get an attack of

3119
03:54:46,848 --> 03:54:55,085
opportunity on you. And that is a 17 to hit. Armor
class is 20, so as it reaches towards you it just

3120
03:54:55,085 --> 03:54:59,798
streaks off your armor (impact). The flames heat
one of the plates below but you manage to pull out

3121
03:54:59,798 --> 03:55:02,759
before it can actually find any real aggressive
attack on you.

3122
03:55:02,759 --> 03:55:06,745
TALIESIN: That was full road runner.

3123
03:55:06,745 --> 03:55:10,496
ASHLEY: 29.

3124
03:55:10,496 --> 03:55:15,696
MATT: So as Pike rushes up to you and touches you
on the side of your waist, as you feel all your

3125
03:55:15,696 --> 03:55:19,166
wounds and burn marks tend to subside and heal up
instantaneously.

3126
03:55:19,166 --> 03:55:21,244
LIAM: Oh yeah! That's good.

3127
03:55:21,244 --> 03:55:23,206
ASHLEY: That's a little bit of something.

3128
03:55:23,206 --> 03:55:24,786
LIAM: Yeah! I'll take it.

3129
03:55:24,786 --> 03:55:27,098
MATT: That ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

3130
03:55:27,098 --> 03:55:32,225
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to do a multiattack
right on Cerkonos. So I'm going to do two

3131
03:55:32,225 --> 03:55:36,666
(impacts) with my big wavy arms.

3132
03:55:36,666 --> 03:55:38,968
MATT: All right, go for it.

3133
03:55:38,968 --> 03:55:49,923
MARISHA: So plus seven to hit. So first one. 18,
so that's 20. Okay. And second one. That's not as

3134
03:55:49,923 --> 03:55:52,372
good. 19? Sorry, 18?

3135
03:55:52,372 --> 03:55:53,712
MATT: 18 also hits.

3136
03:55:53,712 --> 03:56:01,804
MARISHA: Okay. Cool. So that's 2d8 plus four
bludgeoning damage, twice. So that's five, six. So

3137
03:56:01,804 --> 03:56:09,853
that's ten. Nine, plus another 13. 23 points of
damage.

3138
03:56:09,853 --> 03:56:19,304
MATT: 23 points of damage. Your attacks in this
form are considered magical, correct? So yeah, it

3139
03:56:19,304 --> 03:56:22,657
doesn't do half damage. It's full damage, because
normally it would have resistance to bludgeoning.

3140
03:56:22,657 --> 03:56:26,709
But because of your magical weapons, because
you're a crazy druid, full 23 points of damage. As

3141
03:56:26,709 --> 03:56:29,437
all of a sudden the elemental form starts slamming
him with these giant tidal wave-like fists--

3142
03:56:29,437 --> 03:56:33,249
MARISHA: Oh, plus an extra two because I'm a water
elemental.

3143
03:56:33,249 --> 03:56:38,167
MATT: There you go. (wham, wham) You can see,
steam is starting to billow off of Cerkonos's

3144
03:56:38,167 --> 03:56:44,685
elemental form. They're both in this crazy tidal,
epic elemental throw down. This is WWE style.

3145
03:56:44,685 --> 03:56:48,595
ORION: Oh no. It must be stopped!

3146
03:56:48,595 --> 03:56:52,593
MATT: Are you going to stay where you are?

3147
03:56:52,593 --> 03:56:54,346
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm on his ass.

3148
03:56:54,346 --> 03:56:57,191
MATT: All right. That ends Keyleth's turn. Grog,
you're up.

3149
03:56:57,191 --> 03:57:01,365
TRAVIS: Can I move around the backside of him
without him getting an attack of opportunity if I

3150
03:57:01,365 --> 03:57:04,798
stay just as close as I am now? No?

3151
03:57:04,798 --> 03:57:06,906
MATT: As soon as you dart off to the side, he'll
get a strike on you.

3152
03:57:06,906 --> 03:57:08,939
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

3153
03:57:08,939 --> 03:57:11,625
TALIESIN: Can he do a one-space move without an
attack?

3154
03:57:11,625 --> 03:57:18,351
TRAVIS: Just because I'm cooking-- fuck it, I'll
keep swinging. I'm in a frenzied rage.

3155
03:57:18,351 --> 03:57:20,730
MATT: Go for it. Three strikes against Cerkonos.

3156
03:57:20,730 --> 03:57:22,032
TRAVIS: That's a 20.

3157
03:57:22,032 --> 03:57:23,712
LIAM: Natural 20?

3158
03:57:23,712 --> 03:57:25,987
TRAVIS: Oh no, a total of 20. 19.

3159
03:57:25,987 --> 03:57:27,112
MATT: Hits.

3160
03:57:27,112 --> 03:57:29,269
TRAVIS: And a 22.

3161
03:57:29,269 --> 03:57:31,121
MATT: Hits. All three hit.

3162
03:57:31,121 --> 03:57:40,132
TRAVIS: 11. 17. And a 19.

3163
03:57:40,132 --> 03:57:46,849
MATT: 19. (whacks) Once again, streaking into him,
mouth open (roars). The foam that would normally

3164
03:57:46,849 --> 03:57:49,948
be gathering at the side of your mouth though is
just this dried crust on the side, because there's

3165
03:57:49,948 --> 03:57:55,673
just all this heat in the air. With each yell, as
you close your mouth, you can taste the ash that

3166
03:57:55,673 --> 03:57:59,737
is coalesced on the back of your tongue, it's this
terrible smell. It would bother you if you weren't

3167
03:57:59,737 --> 03:58:07,068
so focused in your furied rage in this vicinity.
However, you do take three points of fire damage,

3168
03:58:07,068 --> 03:58:12,925
two points of fire damage, and ten. So a total of
15 points of fire damage from striking at it with

3169
03:58:12,925 --> 03:58:18,226
your axe as the fire blows back onto you. Also, at
the top of your turn because you were on fire, you

3170
03:58:18,226 --> 03:58:24,251
took another eight points of fire damage from the
flames burning and licking up your shoulders. You

3171
03:58:24,251 --> 03:58:29,853
smell the scent of burning hair reach your
nostrils.

3172
03:58:29,853 --> 03:58:33,179
TRAVIS: It's because we're family.

3173
03:58:33,179 --> 03:58:37,168
LIAM: It could be your pubes! Don't jump to
conclusions!

3174
03:58:37,168 --> 03:58:44,542
MATT: That ends Grog's turn. Hold on, that your
turn? At the top, Cerkonos is going to angrily now

3175
03:58:44,542 --> 03:58:52,800
go into three more attacks. One against Keyleth,
two against Grog, because Grog's starting to look

3176
03:58:52,800 --> 03:58:56,749
a little rough, and the flames are affecting him
more than it's affecting Keyleth. He turns to slam

3177
03:58:56,749 --> 03:59:00,707
you twice. That is a 26?

3178
03:59:00,707 --> 03:59:02,338
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

3179
03:59:02,338 --> 03:59:06,933
MATT: Nine plus eight. That is a 17?

3180
03:59:06,933 --> 03:59:08,400
TRAVIS: Misses.

3181
03:59:08,400 --> 03:59:12,590
MATT: 19 plus eight, that's a 27.

3182
03:59:12,590 --> 03:59:14,823
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know if that hits or not.

3183
03:59:14,823 --> 03:59:17,994
MATT: I'm sorry, that one's against Keyleth. So
one hits you, one misses, and the last one was 27

3184
03:59:17,994 --> 03:59:19,220
versus you.

3185
03:59:19,220 --> 03:59:20,625
MARISHA: Yeah...

3186
03:59:20,625 --> 03:59:29,640
MATT: So you take 11 points of fire damage from
the strike. You take ten points, reduce that to

3187
03:59:29,640 --> 03:59:37,699
five. So you take five points of fire damage. That
is Cerkonos's turn. That brings us to Vax.

3188
03:59:37,699 --> 03:59:43,130
LIAM: Okay, so Cerkonos is still busy with
Keyleth, so I'm going to take a split second to

3189
03:59:43,130 --> 03:59:50,791
inhale, exhale, and then (dagger noises) right
from where I am. So 18.

3190
03:59:50,791 --> 03:59:51,901
MATT: 18 hits.

3191
03:59:51,901 --> 03:59:53,666
LIAM: 14.

3192
03:59:53,666 --> 03:59:54,850
MATT: Hits.

3193
03:59:54,850 --> 04:00:01,614
LIAM: Natural 20 for the third. Do I get to pick
which one is the--? Okay, so the first one hit,

3194
04:00:01,614 --> 04:00:17,319
which is sneak attack, so that is four plus seven
is 11, plus-- 14, 17, 23, 25-- 31 for the first

3195
04:00:17,319 --> 04:00:23,640
hit. Second one, which was a hit, is-- which part
gets doubled?

3196
04:00:23,640 --> 04:00:26,388
MATT: Just the dice roll.

3197
04:00:26,388 --> 04:00:28,422
LIAM: The dice roll. Four plus six is ten.

3198
04:00:28,422 --> 04:00:35,198
MATT: All right, so. (whoosh, whoosh, whoosh)
You're launching the daggers out and it's

3199
04:00:35,241 --> 04:00:39,602
difficult to focus on, because there is currently
this swirl of water and flame that is going

3200
04:00:39,602 --> 04:00:46,826
around. As your third dagger hits you can see the
elemental form shrinks, and the water elemental

3201
04:00:46,826 --> 04:00:52,096
that is Keyleth absorbs what you see now, Cerkonos
in human druid form now, floating aloft in the

3202
04:00:52,096 --> 04:01:00,768
center of Keyleth as an elemental. (static) Take
that, microphone. Sorry, guys. (impact) And is

3203
04:01:00,768 --> 04:01:03,639
that your turn?

3204
04:01:03,639 --> 04:01:11,699
LIAM: That's it. Yeah, that's it. I'll back up
against the side of that wall that's right there.

3205
04:01:11,699 --> 04:01:12,652
But that's it.

3206
04:01:12,652 --> 04:01:13,753
MATT: Okay. Vex.

3207
04:01:13,753 --> 04:01:20,003
LAURA: I come around the side of the wall. Hi! Oh
hey. And I shoot at the other guy.

3208
04:01:20,003 --> 04:01:21,640
MATT: All right, go for it.

3209
04:01:21,640 --> 04:01:23,685
LAURA: Is he within ten feet of anything?

3210
04:01:23,685 --> 04:01:25,226
MATT: No.

3211
04:01:25,226 --> 04:01:28,143
LAURA: Then I'm going to Lightning Arrow-- I'm
going to Hunter's Mark him.

3212
04:01:28,143 --> 04:01:30,696
MATT: All right. Hunter's Mark is a bonus action.

3213
04:01:30,696 --> 04:01:32,666
LAURA: Yes, so I'm going to Hail of Thorns him.

3214
04:01:32,666 --> 04:01:33,962
MATT: Okay.

3215
04:01:33,962 --> 04:01:39,766
LAURA: Yes. 15?

3216
04:01:39,766 --> 04:01:42,407
MATT: 15? That does hit.

3217
04:01:42,407 --> 04:02:01,697
LAURA: Yes! 17, plus four, so that's 21, plus
3d10. 14.

3218
04:02:01,697 --> 04:02:08,766
MATT: All righty. As you come around the corner, 
releasing the arrow, it slams into the

3219
04:02:08,766 --> 04:02:12,731
side of the elemental, bursts into it, you can see
the splinters shooting throughout its form,

3220
04:02:12,731 --> 04:02:17,706
sending out all these little fiery sparks as all
the thorns burst into flames from the contact with

3221
04:02:17,706 --> 04:02:21,125
the body, which then diminish and burn away into
ash in the middle of the air.

3222
04:02:21,125 --> 04:02:26,485
LAURA: Take two! That one doesn't hit, though.

3223
04:02:26,485 --> 04:02:27,809
MATT: What was that?

3224
04:02:27,809 --> 04:02:28,918
LAURA: 13.

3225
04:02:28,918 --> 04:02:30,009
MATT: 13 just hits.

3226
04:02:30,009 --> 04:02:31,754
(cheering)

3227
04:02:31,754 --> 04:02:33,231
MATT: Don't have huge AC.

3228
04:02:33,231 --> 04:02:40,354
LAURA: Yay! 16. 20.

3229
04:02:40,354 --> 04:02:46,423
MATT: 20, all right. (impact) The arrow hits and
then bursts and gets caught into its form before

3230
04:02:46,423 --> 04:02:52,765
it eventually gets expelled, it is just this tiny
flaming shaft. That ends your turn? All righty.

3231
04:02:52,765 --> 04:03:02,476
That brings us to Tiberius. At the top of your
turn, you take ten points of fire damage, reduced

3232
04:03:02,476 --> 04:03:04,861
to five, from the flames that are burning on your
body.

3233
04:03:04,861 --> 04:03:14,372
ORION: And I turn to the fire elemental because
they're coherent, right? I'm like, do you really

3234
04:03:14,372 --> 04:03:17,881
need me to do this? I ask it the question.

3235
04:03:17,881 --> 04:03:26,732
MATT: Currently, the elemental is just in the
middle of-- it's just an amorphous flaming mass.

3236
04:03:26,732 --> 04:03:30,485
LAURA: He's like one of those creatures at a gas
station.

3237
04:03:30,485 --> 04:03:38,652
(laughter)

3238
04:03:38,652 --> 04:03:46,924
ORION: Fine, so I go, Glacial Blast! With my
finger. (hiss)

3239
04:03:46,924 --> 04:03:54,118
MATT: Okay. For its saving throw, it rolls an 18.
What's your DC on that?

3240
04:03:54,118 --> 04:03:55,473
ORION: 17.

3241
04:03:55,473 --> 04:03:58,093
MATT: So half damage. Go ahead and roll for the
targeted blast.

3242
04:03:58,093 --> 04:04:02,014
ORION: 14.

3243
04:04:02,014 --> 04:04:15,371
MARISHA: 14, 17, 18, plus six, so it's 24, plus
another eight, so that's 32.

3244
04:04:15,371 --> 04:04:16,748
ORION: 32.

3245
04:04:16,748 --> 04:04:21,582
MATT: 32 points of ice damage reduced to half,
because of that, so it takes 16 points of ice

3246
04:04:21,582 --> 04:04:27,964
damage and would be grappled, if it wasn't immune
to being grappled. As the ice encases around it,

3247
04:04:27,964 --> 04:04:34,543
its fire form flicks out from underneath the ice
and keeps itself fluid and moving.

3248
04:04:34,543 --> 04:04:40,279
ORION: And I will use two sorcery points to
quicken a spell and use my cantrip Control Flame

3249
04:04:40,279 --> 04:04:43,967
to (whoosh) start juggling the flame that I was
caught on fire with.

3250
04:04:43,967 --> 04:04:47,112
(laughter)

3251
04:04:47,112 --> 04:04:54,694
MATT: And with that, Tiberius, you gather the fire
off of your body-- I'll say you are no longer on

3252
04:04:54,694 --> 04:04:59,718
fire, as your Control Flame has pulled the fire
from your torso and you're now just tossing it

3253
04:04:59,718 --> 04:05:01,743
around in the middle of the Elemental Plane of
Fire.

3254
04:05:01,743 --> 04:05:03,311
ORION: Would somebody end this, please?

3255
04:05:03,311 --> 04:05:12,699
MATT: The elemental's turn. It turns angrily
towards you, trying to shoot it constantly with

3256
04:05:12,699 --> 04:05:17,213
the ice blast. Rushes forward (whoosh) with
immediate speed, darts up in front of you,

3257
04:05:17,213 --> 04:05:23,114
attacking twice. That is a two, so that misses.
That's a total of eight. And 19?

3258
04:05:23,114 --> 04:05:25,763
TALIESIN: It's a what?

3259
04:05:25,763 --> 04:05:26,854
MATT: 19.

3260
04:05:26,854 --> 04:05:29,351
TALIESIN: It's a 19? I'm going to spend a grit
point and say that doesn't hit.

3261
04:05:29,351 --> 04:05:31,064
MATT: Gunslinger's dodge?

3262
04:05:31,064 --> 04:05:32,589
TALIESIN: Yep, I'm going to Gunslinger's dodge.

3263
04:05:32,589 --> 04:05:36,495
MATT: All righty. As it swipes out for you, you
spend your grit point to dodge out of the way,

3264
04:05:36,495 --> 04:05:42,539
slow-mo. The giant flaming hand streaks past you.
What bit of scruff you had on your chin is now

3265
04:05:42,539 --> 04:05:51,010
slowly withered away and burned into evaporated
air. It's pretty rough. That ends its turn. Percy

3266
04:05:51,010 --> 04:05:53,402
and Pike? You immediately have your action.

3267
04:05:53,402 --> 04:05:59,546
TALIESIN: I'm going to unload into its body. I
know I'm at a disadvantage because I'm that close,

3268
04:05:59,546 --> 04:06:01,663
but I'm just going to unload into its body.

3269
04:06:01,663 --> 04:06:03,311
MATT: So three attacks at disadvantage.

3270
04:06:03,311 --> 04:06:05,441
TALIESIN: Three attacks with disadvantage.

3271
04:06:05,441 --> 04:06:07,120
MARISHA: Was that a 20?

3272
04:06:07,120 --> 04:06:10,506
TALIESIN: That was a 17, but it's okay, because I
have disadvantage, so that's a 21.

3273
04:06:10,506 --> 04:06:13,242
MATT: Hits. Second one?

3274
04:06:13,242 --> 04:06:16,092
TALIESIN: 17.

3275
04:06:16,092 --> 04:06:17,651
MATT: Hits. Third one?

3276
04:06:17,651 --> 04:06:21,849
TALIESIN: 26.

3277
04:06:21,849 --> 04:06:24,559
ORION and LIAM: (gunshots)

3278
04:06:24,559 --> 04:06:27,165
MATT: So three shots against it.

3279
04:06:27,165 --> 04:06:39,763
TALIESIN: 18, plus 23, 26. 35 points of damage.

3280
04:06:39,763 --> 04:06:53,426
MATT: 35 points of damage. (gunshots) As each one
blasts through, the elemental form shimmers, and

3281
04:06:53,426 --> 04:07:01,858
you can see now the druid left there in its space.
Lands on its knees, looks up at you, and gives you

3282
04:07:01,858 --> 04:07:10,051
a quick little smile. At this point, you guys hear
(roaring flames) this rolling, crumbling, angry,

3283
04:07:10,051 --> 04:07:17,363
fiery sound as you glance over and you can see the
cinderstorm is nearly upon you at this point in

3284
04:07:17,363 --> 04:07:25,197
time. At this juncture, you guys can continue to
fight if you want to, but you can see Cerkonos is

3285
04:07:25,197 --> 04:07:30,803
looking over and looks at the rest of you. "We
should go. Now."

3286
04:07:30,803 --> 04:07:32,357
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

3287
04:07:32,357 --> 04:07:33,979
LAURA: Did you complete the mission?

3288
04:07:33,979 --> 04:07:39,900
MARISHA: I slowly release him down from my water
elemental form.

3289
04:07:39,900 --> 04:07:47,879
MATT: As he touches down, he immediately (poof)
turns into a giant eagle, swoops and grabs you,

3290
04:07:47,879 --> 04:07:51,837
Pike, (gripping sound) and heads towards the
exit.

3291
04:07:51,837 --> 04:07:53,839
LAURA: I guess it's time to go.

3292
04:07:53,839 --> 04:07:56,077
ORION: I think we should go, yes.

3293
04:07:56,077 --> 04:08:02,061
MARISHA: I drop my-- no. I'm going to keep in my
water elemental form.

3294
04:08:02,061 --> 04:08:04,775
MATT: Okay. What's the speed on it?

3295
04:08:04,775 --> 04:08:06,585
MARISHA: 30.

3296
04:08:06,585 --> 04:08:10,646
MATT: Okay, so same speed as you normally would
be. All right, so. As you guys begin charging back

3297
04:08:10,646 --> 04:08:14,946
in the direction you came from, dodging the lava
pools as you come, the cinderstorm begins rolling

3298
04:08:14,946 --> 04:08:19,127
in and you can see it's a full like-- you know
that scene in the Mad Max movie? Looks like that,

3299
04:08:19,127 --> 04:08:24,790
and it's pouring into the path you guys are
running. You get about halfway there, about ten

3300
04:08:24,790 --> 04:08:28,825
minutes into this run before the heat grows so
intense that you can feel it now burning at the

3301
04:08:28,825 --> 04:08:29,933
side of the face.

3302
04:08:29,933 --> 04:08:35,841
MARISHA: Okay, I lied. I drop my elemental form. I
go ahead and I'm going to cast Gust of Wind ahead

3303
04:08:35,841 --> 04:08:39,998
of us to try and make a tunnel and try and air
this heat down.

3304
04:08:39,998 --> 04:08:45,290
MATT: Okay. That helps a little bit and gives you
guys a little more leeway as you're pushing

3305
04:08:45,290 --> 04:08:52,236
forward. The storm blows over you entirely, and
darkness comes in. It feels like you're in the

3306
04:08:52,236 --> 04:08:56,797
center of a cloud. There is light, somewhat, but
your vision is obscured about five feet ahead of

3307
04:08:56,797 --> 04:09:00,895
you and you think you're heading in the right
direction towards the portal. You can see roughly,

3308
04:09:00,895 --> 04:09:04,646
as Cerkonos is carrying you through the storm, I
need everyone to go ahead and make a constitution

3309
04:09:04,646 --> 04:09:05,460
check.

3310
04:09:05,460 --> 04:09:08,382
ASHLEY: Could I do a Mass Cure Wounds before I go?
Because I was going to do that right last minute.

3311
04:09:08,382 --> 04:09:12,477
MATT: You currently are being held aloft, and you
can't see the rest of your party, unfortunately.

3312
04:09:12,477 --> 04:09:14,231
You can ask him to drop you, if you want.

3313
04:09:14,231 --> 04:09:17,036
LIAM: I'm reaching out and clasping Vex's hand as
we run forward.

3314
04:09:17,036 --> 04:09:18,386
MARISHA: What are rolling?

3315
04:09:18,386 --> 04:09:19,599
TALIESIN: Constitution check.

3316
04:09:19,599 --> 04:09:21,537
ASHLEY: All of us?

3317
04:09:21,537 --> 04:09:24,093
MARISHA: That's not too bad.

3318
04:09:24,093 --> 04:09:26,863
TALIESIN: Okay! 21.

3319
04:09:26,863 --> 04:09:27,880
MARISHA: 22.

3320
04:09:27,880 --> 04:09:28,936
ORION: 19.

3321
04:09:28,936 --> 04:09:29,924
LIAM: Ten.

3322
04:09:29,924 --> 04:09:30,741
LAURA: Nine.

3323
04:09:30,741 --> 04:09:31,733
ASHLEY: Five.

3324
04:09:31,733 --> 04:09:33,460
TRAVIS: 13.

3325
04:09:33,460 --> 04:09:34,839
MARISHA: Aw, we were the happy table.

3326
04:09:34,839 --> 04:09:37,086
(laughter)

3327
04:09:37,086 --> 04:09:42,726
MATT: You guys keep pushing forward. For you guys,
the sheer amount of heated ash that is starting to

3328
04:09:42,726 --> 04:09:45,763
pour into your lungs, even though Keyleth is
keeping a tunnel ahead of you--

3329
04:09:45,763 --> 04:09:48,102
LAURA: We're a little further behind her.
(laughs)

3330
04:09:48,102 --> 04:09:52,245
MATT: All of you suffer ten points of fire
damage.

3331
04:09:52,245 --> 04:09:55,386
TRAVIS: Can I use my stone's endurance?

3332
04:09:55,386 --> 04:09:57,103
MATT: You can, yes.

3333
04:09:57,103 --> 04:09:58,470
TRAVIS: Okay. Shit.

3334
04:09:58,470 --> 04:10:01,989
ASHLEY: I'm going to ask him to drop me, and I'm
going to do a Mass Cure Wounds.

3335
04:10:01,989 --> 04:10:03,443
MATT: Okay.

3336
04:10:03,443 --> 04:10:05,671
ASHLEY: Oh fuck, how high am I?

3337
04:10:05,671 --> 04:10:06,795
MATT: You don't know.

3338
04:10:06,795 --> 04:10:09,138
LAURA and MARISHA: No, don't do it, Pike!

3339
04:10:09,138 --> 04:10:10,625
ASHLEY: He's dying!

3340
04:10:10,625 --> 04:10:13,061
TRAVIS: No, I'm okay. I got back 19 points.

3341
04:10:13,061 --> 04:10:17,779
MATT: Okay. You shrug off that damage. You don't
heal past it, you just shrug off that damage.

3342
04:10:17,779 --> 04:10:19,245
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

3343
04:10:19,245 --> 04:10:20,686
MATT: So you take no damage from that.

3344
04:10:20,686 --> 04:10:22,270
ASHLEY: Oh. That's good.

3345
04:10:22,270 --> 04:10:29,104
MATT: So. As you guys are racing forward, the
storm is still blowing and you can hear Cerkonos

3346
04:10:29,104 --> 04:10:36,265
shouting as a hawk, adding this beacon of noise as
you guys are trying to follow suit. Since you're

3347
04:10:36,265 --> 04:10:38,671
leading the way, Keyleth, I want you to go ahead
and make a survival check.

3348
04:10:38,671 --> 04:10:45,138
MARISHA: I was going to say, can I use my wanderer
ability where I think I get-- my survival ability?

3349
04:10:45,138 --> 04:10:48,830
I think I get advantage?

3350
04:10:48,830 --> 04:10:53,036
MATT: I'll give you advantage on this survival
check. Go for it.

3351
04:10:53,036 --> 04:11:02,038
MARISHA: Please. That's much better! Okay. 14. No,
don't-- sorry, I rolled a 14. 24!

3352
04:11:02,038 --> 04:11:09,307
MATT: 24. You're able to keep a focused direction
on both where Cerkonos is going and keeping a

3353
04:11:09,307 --> 04:11:13,257
connection to where that portal was you guys
stepped through to get to this elemental plane. As

3354
04:11:13,257 --> 04:11:17,611
you're pushing forward, you find yourself not
getting lost in this darkened storm, thankfully.

3355
04:11:17,611 --> 04:11:24,096
Slowly ahead of you, Keyleth, you see what looks
like the slowly rotating portal that you guys

3356
04:11:24,096 --> 04:11:25,291
stepped through.

3357
04:11:25,291 --> 04:11:26,459
MARISHA: We're almost there!

3358
04:11:26,459 --> 04:11:28,730
MATT: Everyone once again make a constitution
save.

3359
04:11:28,730 --> 04:11:29,951
MARISHA: Hold on!

3360
04:11:29,951 --> 04:11:31,178
LAURA: Which one?

3361
04:11:31,178 --> 04:11:33,131
TALIESIN: Yes!

3362
04:11:33,131 --> 04:11:35,877
LAURA: That's good. That was better!

3363
04:11:35,877 --> 04:11:37,801
TALIESIN: 21.

3364
04:11:37,801 --> 04:11:38,788
MARISHA: 13.

3365
04:11:38,788 --> 04:11:39,737
ORION: 14.

3366
04:11:39,737 --> 04:11:40,471
LIAM: 14.

3367
04:11:40,471 --> 04:11:41,361
LAURA: 18.

3368
04:11:41,361 --> 04:11:42,180
ASHLEY: Eight.

3369
04:11:42,180 --> 04:11:43,198
TRAVIS 19.

3370
04:11:43,198 --> 04:11:53,103
MATT: All right. Everyone below a 15, you take 12
points of fire damage as the fumes come into your

3371
04:11:53,103 --> 04:12:01,819
lungs. The wind tunnel is helping reduce the DC of
the roll to a certain extent, but this is a very

3372
04:12:01,819 --> 04:12:06,992
dangerous storm to be in. Essentially, every
minute that passes that you're in it--

3373
04:12:06,992 --> 04:12:09,267
TRAVIS: Can I use a hit dice to heal myself at
all?

3374
04:12:09,267 --> 04:12:14,944
MATT: You need a short rest to get there. You guys
make your way to the outskirts of the portal and

3375
04:12:14,944 --> 04:12:21,540
you leap through, as one by one, you all jump into
this portal, the druids following behind. The

3376
04:12:21,540 --> 04:12:27,866
sense of falling becomes this jettison motion as
you are shoved and thrown into the air, out of the

3377
04:12:27,866 --> 04:12:34,762
portal, and landing about 15 feet, 20 feet from
the fall. I need all of you guys to make

3378
04:12:34,762 --> 04:12:37,054
an acrobatics check.

3379
04:12:37,054 --> 04:12:39,137
LIAM: Oh, you bastard.

3380
04:12:39,137 --> 04:12:43,833
TALIESIN: Can I use my saving throw reroll that I
get?

3381
04:12:43,833 --> 04:12:45,898
MATT: It's a skill check.

3382
04:12:45,898 --> 04:12:47,702
TALIESIN: It's a skill check? Damn it. Okay.

3383
04:12:47,702 --> 04:12:54,043
MATT: So. Grog?

3384
04:12:54,043 --> 04:12:55,348
TRAVIS: Six.

3385
04:12:55,348 --> 04:13:00,516
LAURA: Pike, what'd you roll?

3386
04:13:00,516 --> 04:13:02,051
ASHLEY: 16.

3387
04:13:02,051 --> 04:13:05,216
LAURA: One!

3388
04:13:05,216 --> 04:13:06,496
LIAM: 25.

3389
04:13:06,496 --> 04:13:07,519
ORION: One!

3390
04:13:07,519 --> 04:13:08,473
MARISHA: 19.

3391
04:13:08,473 --> 04:13:09,372
TALIESIN: 12.

3392
04:13:09,372 --> 04:13:16,649
MATT: All right. Percy, Tiberius, Vax, and Grog
all take three points of damage from the fall.

3393
04:13:16,649 --> 04:13:25,308
(whack) You've hit the ground around this open
lava crevasse, smacking onto the ground, looking

3394
04:13:25,308 --> 04:13:33,410
up into the air, catching your first gasp of
relatively clean air, comparatively to where you

3395
04:13:33,410 --> 04:13:40,757
just were. You hear with a rumbling sound, the
lava spiral begins to close off (sucking sound).

3396
04:13:40,757 --> 04:13:44,794
ASHLEY Mass Cure Wounds? 33.

3397
04:13:44,794 --> 04:13:47,778
LIAM: What about my sister and Tibsy?

3398
04:13:47,778 --> 04:13:49,686
TRAVIS: Everybody gets 33 points.

3399
04:13:49,686 --> 04:13:52,327
MATT: Oh, you guys managed to catch yourself, and
don't take any damage as you land on your feet.

3400
04:13:52,327 --> 04:13:54,225
LIAM: Because they rolled a one.

3401
04:13:54,225 --> 04:13:55,405
MATT: Oh, you rolled a one?

3402
04:13:55,405 --> 04:13:56,943
LAURA: Me and Tiberius rolled ones.

3403
04:13:56,943 --> 04:13:59,336
MATT: Oh, I thought you rolled a one. I'm sorry.
You take the three damage.

3404
04:13:59,336 --> 04:14:07,660
LAURA: Oh, that's it? Well. It's easy to get us
confused though because we look so similar.

3405
04:14:07,660 --> 04:14:09,628
MATT: That is true.

3406
04:14:09,628 --> 04:14:15,399
ASHLEY: 33, guys.

3407
04:14:15,399 --> 04:14:16,937
TALIESIN: 33.

3408
04:14:16,937 --> 04:14:21,101
MATT: As the lava vortex closes, you can see the
cinderstorm that's been billowing out like a giant

3409
04:14:21,101 --> 04:14:31,536
stack of black smoke and burning embers slowly
fades away, the portal closing off entirely. As

3410
04:14:31,536 --> 04:14:35,517
the molten rock pool comes to rest, Cerkonos is
now standing out, covered in soot like the rest of

3411
04:14:35,517 --> 04:14:40,218
you, and he steps forward and releases his hand
out towards Keyleth, as you're sitting on the

3412
04:14:40,218 --> 04:14:49,561
ground from the fall. Lifts you up to your feet.
Looks you in the eye. "You. You have the blessing

3413
04:14:49,561 --> 04:14:51,512
"of the Pyrah behind you."

3414
04:14:51,512 --> 04:14:54,992
TRAVIS: Yeah, Keyleth!

3415
04:14:54,992 --> 04:14:56,850
TALIESIN: Bravo!

3416
04:14:56,850 --> 04:15:04,815
MATT: "Go forth and continue your Aramente knowing
we acknowledge your wisdom and ability."

3417
04:15:04,815 --> 04:15:09,034
MARISHA: Thank you, Cerkonos. Brother.

3418
04:15:09,034 --> 04:15:18,275
MATT: He reaches his hand out and clasps it. Lifts
you to your feet. At this point he turns and nods

3419
04:15:18,275 --> 04:15:23,560
to one of the nearby druids. The druid steps
forward, presenting a black orb about that big of

3420
04:15:23,560 --> 04:15:29,279
blackened rock that has red veins of pulsing
energy arcing through it like a bolt of lightning

3421
04:15:29,279 --> 04:15:38,464
locked in a single moment in time. "This is a
spark stone, rare within the realm you just

3422
04:15:38,464 --> 04:15:48,045
"escaped. We've harvested but a handful over
generations, and few have returned with them. This

3423
04:15:48,045 --> 04:15:57,101
"one is yours, Keyleth. To use yourself, or
bequeath to an ally. When crushed by the hands of

3424
04:15:57,101 --> 04:16:03,383
"one, their fists shall burn with the fury of an
efreet."

3425
04:16:03,383 --> 04:16:06,205
LAURA: For how long?

3426
04:16:06,205 --> 04:16:08,785
MATT: "For as long as you wish."

3427
04:16:08,785 --> 04:16:10,253
LAURA: Forever!

3428
04:16:10,253 --> 04:16:15,047
MATT: "The choice is yours, who this blessing is
given."

3429
04:16:15,047 --> 04:16:19,335
MARISHA: Thank you. This is a great honor.

3430
04:16:19,335 --> 04:16:31,251
MATT: "Well. You're welcome to stay as long as you
wish before you must continue on your journey."

3431
04:16:31,251 --> 04:16:36,051
MARISHA: I think a rest might be in order. I'm
exhausted.

3432
04:16:36,051 --> 04:16:40,800
TRAVIS: Yeah. You think they have graham crackers
and little bits of chocolate with marshmallow?

3433
04:16:40,800 --> 04:16:43,266
MARISHA: Oh, to make s'mores? That's a great
idea.

3434
04:16:43,266 --> 04:16:44,401
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

3435
04:16:44,401 --> 04:16:46,873
LAURA: And also a lot of water.

3436
04:16:46,873 --> 04:16:48,694
TALIESIN: Water would be lovely.

3437
04:16:48,694 --> 04:16:50,765
MARISHA: Do you have water, Cerkonos?

3438
04:16:50,765 --> 04:16:54,067
ORION: I have water! (spraying)

3439
04:16:54,067 --> 04:17:00,847
MATT: At which point, water begins spewing forth
from this vial that Tiberius has. (spraying) All

3440
04:17:00,847 --> 04:17:03,848
this steam is rising up as it hits the ground, the
heat from the vicinity--

3441
04:17:03,848 --> 04:17:10,248
ORION: It's mainly for drinking and such, but are
we all done?

3442
04:17:10,248 --> 04:17:16,744
MATT: The other druids step forward, looking a
little thirsty themselves. It's a magical source

3443
04:17:16,744 --> 04:17:23,058
of water, where they have to toil to bring it to
their location. They all take out their cups and

3444
04:17:23,058 --> 04:17:29,471
fill from it. You all drink. They take the small
cups they have off to the side, they cheer to you,

3445
04:17:29,471 --> 04:17:36,285
eventually leading you out of the Cindergrove. You
guys break your way towards the druidic village on

3446
04:17:36,285 --> 04:17:45,923
the outskirts of the forest. Cerkonos gives a nod,
rubs his shoulder. "I am to tend to the wounds of

3447
04:17:45,923 --> 04:17:55,813
"my helpers in your test. Do as you see fit. Leave
when you feel comfortable. And good luck."

3448
04:17:55,813 --> 04:18:00,319
MARISHA: I bow to him, and I salute, and I say,
Kaitiake, brother.

3449
04:18:00,319 --> 04:18:05,961
MATT: "Kaitiake, princess." And he turns around
and steps back towards the forest.

3450
04:18:05,961 --> 04:18:11,885
TRAVIS: Your people are fucking sweet.

3451
04:18:11,885 --> 04:18:14,309
(laughter)

3452
04:18:14,309 --> 04:18:16,579
MARISHA: Thank you.

3453
04:18:16,579 --> 04:18:19,433
ORION: Yes, I rather enjoyed that environment
myself.

3454
04:18:19,433 --> 04:18:22,568
ASHLEY: What does kaitiake mean?

3455
04:18:22,568 --> 04:18:34,139
MARISHA: It is sort of our salute. It means
"guardian" and "brethren." It's a high salute.

3456
04:18:34,139 --> 04:18:35,574
LAURA: (mispronouncing) Kaitiake.

3457
04:18:35,574 --> 04:18:37,207
MARISHA: Kaitiake.

3458
04:18:37,207 --> 04:18:38,711
LAURA: Kaitiake.

3459
04:18:38,711 --> 04:18:46,678
LIAM: And not tomorrow please, but where do you
need to go next for this quest of yours?

3460
04:18:46,678 --> 04:18:56,431
MARISHA: Well, my last stop would be to the Water
Ashari. In Aquas. Back on another continent.

3461
04:18:56,431 --> 04:19:00,433
TRAVIS: Well, that's good. I don't think we could
take another one right now, anyway.

3462
04:19:00,433 --> 04:19:05,352
MARISHA: No, I don't think we could. I'm doing
pretty good, actually. I'm ahead of schedule.

3463
04:19:05,352 --> 04:19:10,616
ORION: (laughs) Wonderful. Let's just take some
respite.

3464
04:19:10,616 --> 04:19:11,960
TRAVIS: Yeah, please.

3465
04:19:11,960 --> 04:19:16,044
MATT: We'll say for the sake of brevity, as it is
getting rather late, and which for all of you guys

3466
04:19:16,044 --> 04:19:21,672
watching, consider this lengthy episode a gift for
the fact that we won't be doing this next week

3467
04:19:21,672 --> 04:19:26,971
because some of us will be out of town. But you
rest for a bit. You eventually find your way back

3468
04:19:26,971 --> 04:19:30,430
down to the base of the mountain range. Your
horses have not been touched, although they are a

3469
04:19:30,430 --> 04:19:39,497
little hungry. An uneventful journey, make your
way back to Vasselheim, where over the past six or

3470
04:19:39,497 --> 04:19:44,907
seven days of travel, Pike, you come to find the
curse has been lifted from the temple of Sarenrae,

3471
04:19:44,907 --> 04:19:51,679
and your followers, as they are now calling
themselves, though you had not expected to become

3472
04:19:51,679 --> 04:19:58,412
this beacon of light to these worshipers who had
no central focus or entity to guide them in their

3473
04:19:58,412 --> 04:20:03,956
worship, you've become a very important figure to
them, and they welcome your return to the temple.

3474
04:20:03,956 --> 04:20:06,165
ASHLEY: (quietly) Oh, but I don't want to go
back.

3475
04:20:06,165 --> 04:20:08,448
(laughter)

3476
04:20:08,448 --> 04:20:10,258
ASHLEY: What if I want to stay?

3477
04:20:10,258 --> 04:20:13,794
MATT: Then talk to the producers of Blindspot.

3478
04:20:13,794 --> 04:20:19,710
LIAM: You're an important figure to us as well,
Pickles.

3479
04:20:19,710 --> 04:20:21,444
ASHLEY: Pickles.

3480
04:20:21,444 --> 04:20:26,421
TRAVIS: Yeah, you've done so much for our lives.
Maybe you continue to do good in these lives?

3481
04:20:26,421 --> 04:20:29,454
ASHLEY: Well... debatable.

3482
04:20:29,454 --> 04:20:35,169
TRAVIS: You can leave them anytime, and we'll kick
their ass so you can come back.

3483
04:20:35,169 --> 04:20:38,481
LAURA: Any moment at all.

3484
04:20:38,481 --> 04:20:43,650
ASHLEY: This was so great, being a part of your
journey that you had.

3485
04:20:43,650 --> 04:20:48,067
ORION: You are always part of our journey, no
matter where we go, Pike.

3486
04:20:48,067 --> 04:20:50,036
TRAVIS: Just keep the poo close.

3487
04:20:50,036 --> 04:20:51,322
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

3488
04:20:51,322 --> 04:20:53,187
LAURA: I mean, I don't know what it does exactly.

3489
04:20:53,187 --> 04:20:55,076
MARISHA: We have a good feeling about it.

3490
04:20:55,076 --> 04:20:56,944
LIAM: Just put your faith in Sarenrae.

3491
04:20:56,944 --> 04:20:59,522
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, I guess I'll go.

3492
04:20:59,522 --> 04:21:01,119
LAURA: (choked sob noise)

3493
04:21:01,119 --> 04:21:02,431
ASHLEY: Kaitiake.

3494
04:21:02,431 --> 04:21:04,662
(cheering)

3495
04:21:04,662 --> 04:21:07,523
LAURA: Explosions!

3496
04:21:07,523 --> 04:21:08,785
LIAM: Tatonka.

3497
04:21:08,785 --> 04:21:10,230
TRAVIS: Tatonka, yeah!

3498
04:21:10,230 --> 04:21:13,863
ORION: I'm sorry, but Tiberius runs up and
squeezes Pike, one more time.

3499
04:21:13,863 --> 04:21:15,865
ASHLEY: Hugs and loves.

3500
04:21:15,865 --> 04:21:18,436
ORION: You're my favorite gnome.

3501
04:21:18,436 --> 04:21:23,365
ASHLEY: Oh, thanks. You're my favorite--
everything, I guess.

3502
04:21:23,365 --> 04:21:25,359
(laughter)

3503
04:21:25,359 --> 04:21:26,929
ASHLEY: Dragonborn.

3504
04:21:26,929 --> 04:21:33,066
MATT: Pike turns and returns towards the
excavation of the long-lost temple of Sarenrae,

3505
04:21:33,066 --> 04:21:34,275
you all give her--

3506
04:21:34,275 --> 04:21:35,985
LAURA: It hurts every time, Pike.

3507
04:21:35,985 --> 04:21:38,995
TRAVIS: We'll see you soon.

3508
04:21:38,995 --> 04:21:41,471
ASHLEY: Oh, okay.

3509
04:21:41,471 --> 04:21:46,698
MATT: And Keyleth, you have the boon of the spark
stone to gift to whoever or whatever you see fit.

3510
04:21:46,698 --> 04:21:49,055
MARISHA: Do I know what it does? Can I do like a
check on it?

3511
04:21:49,055 --> 04:21:55,653
MATT: Best you can ascertain, looking at it, is
once the stone is crushed, the hands of whatever

3512
04:21:55,653 --> 04:22:02,405
creature crushes it become bequeathed with the
flame of the elemental plane itself.

3513
04:22:02,405 --> 04:22:05,392
ORION: Interesting.

3514
04:22:05,392 --> 04:22:07,993
LIAM: That would be good for anybody.

3515
04:22:07,993 --> 04:22:10,114
ASHLEY: Can she use it? Well, she already has
that.

3516
04:22:10,114 --> 04:22:11,889
MARISHA: I'll keep it safe.

3517
04:22:11,889 --> 04:22:16,405
MATT: You can keep tabs on it. It doesn't affect a
weapon if you're holding it. It's only physical

3518
04:22:16,405 --> 04:22:19,693
attacks like punches, claws, anything like that
are affected by the flame.

3519
04:22:19,693 --> 04:22:24,759
MARISHA: Could be cool for Grog. Boxing.

3520
04:22:24,759 --> 04:22:27,954
TALIESIN: Would it enchant anything in animal
form?

3521
04:22:27,954 --> 04:22:30,049
MARISHA: Oh, claws? You said claws?

3522
04:22:30,049 --> 04:22:35,325
MATT: Yeah. So an animal form of yours, Trinket,
anyone like that would have flames on their

3523
04:22:35,325 --> 04:22:36,510
forearms.

3524
04:22:36,510 --> 04:22:39,485
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll wait until something is
negated.

3525
04:22:39,485 --> 04:22:41,433
LIAM: Sleep on it.

3526
04:22:41,433 --> 04:22:52,320
MATT: Go ahead and mark Spark Stone in your
inventory. And with that, as it is 11:30, we're

3527
04:22:52,320 --> 04:22:56,284
going to go ahead and bring this-- (laughs) Bring
this session to a close, thank you guys for your

3528
04:22:56,284 --> 04:23:01,907
patience. Thank you crew for your patience. Wanted
to give Ashley a proper send-off and bring the

3529
04:23:01,907 --> 04:23:08,323
conclusion to this chapter of the Aramente for
Keyleth. Well done on your first brief journey to

3530
04:23:08,323 --> 04:23:10,591
the harsh landscape that is the Elemental Plane of
Fire.

3531
04:23:10,591 --> 04:23:12,210
TRAVIS: Fuck that place.

3532
04:23:12,210 --> 04:23:15,973
LAURA: That's awful. Thank god that dragon didn't
freaking attack us.

3533
04:23:15,973 --> 04:23:19,966
TRAVIS: They don't sell any timeshares there, I
gather.

3534
04:23:19,966 --> 04:23:30,162
MATT: Just a reminder guys, me and Marisha will be
out of town next week. There will be no Critical

3535
04:23:30,162 --> 04:23:36,409
Role. We'll have members here that will be
still here to stream and play games and answer

3536
04:23:36,409 --> 04:23:38,716
questions and all kinds of stuff they'll have
planned, I'm sure.

3537
04:23:38,716 --> 04:23:43,039
TALIESIN: Oh, and if you're in Denver I will be
at-- is it Nan Desu Kan? I'm blanking. I'll be in

3538
04:23:43,039 --> 04:23:48,144
Denver at Nan Desu Kan, so you can go see me in
Denver.

3539
04:23:48,144 --> 04:23:50,673
MATT: That's awesome. And some of you guys are
going to be at--

3540
04:23:50,673 --> 04:23:56,646
LAURA: We're going to be at SacAnime next week.
The three of us.

3541
04:23:56,646 --> 04:23:58,943
TRAVIS: The two twins and the handsome one.

3542
04:23:58,943 --> 04:24:05,721
LAURA: And I'm going to be at PAX tomorrow and
Saturday, so I'm leaving tomorrow morning to head

3543
04:24:05,721 --> 04:24:12,061
up to Seattle. Go say hi. We're doing a crowdplay of
Tales from the Borderlands on Saturday night. You

3544
04:24:12,118 --> 04:24:13,082
should come.

3545
04:24:13,082 --> 04:24:14,339
MATT: That's going to be fun.

3546
04:24:14,339 --> 04:24:16,131
ORION: So tune in next week for Chalk Talk with
Tiberius.

3547
04:24:16,131 --> 04:24:18,134
MATT and LIAM: Yes!

3548
04:24:18,134 --> 04:40:27,800
