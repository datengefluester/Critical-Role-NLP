NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a
voice actor and the Dungeon Master for Critical

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:09.064
Role here at Geek &amp; Sundry, and today's episode of
GM tips is actually more for the players this

00:00:09.064 --> 00:00:13.734
time, as this discussion revolves around the
creation and roleplaying of characters that are

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:18.573
radically different from your expectations of the
genre tropes you know. Here are some thoughts on

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:20.745
roleplaying against type.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:26.192
[intro music]

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.905
MATT: There are many tropes in genre stories and
games, and they largely come from a place of

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:35.675
appreciation and rationality. A charismatic bard
will usually be full of smiles and song. A

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:40.354
well-learned magic user might likely end up
haughty and prone to mage-splaining. A ranger who

00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:45.814
wanders the wilderness alone is probably going to
be socially brusque and dark of mood, or a dark

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:49.805
elf with twin scimitars and a pet panther. But
seriously, stop it. This shit got out of hand in

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:55.152
the early '90s. Don't. Outside of that example,
there is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:59.263
these personality archetypes at all. They can all
lead to extremely fun characters, and the real

00:00:59.263 --> 00:01:04.644
meat comes from the nuances you impart via the
backstory and play experience with them. However,

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:09.646
I also recommend players occasionally take a walk
on the wild side. Lean into the weird and play

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:11.445
against those tropes a bit.

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:15.724 line:1
For instance, when creating a character, think
about what would make a good foil to their

00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:20.383 line:1
strengths. What element of their personality or
story could really lend to interesting conflict,

00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:26.234
both internally and externally, based solely on
their class? Much of this can be character flavor,

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:30.734
not mechanical, but that is totally up to you. For
instance, rogues are known for their

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:35.445
professionally stealthy, nimble selves, staying
out of the public eye. But imagine a Mr.

00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:40.074
Bean-esque fool who wandered into the field of
thievery accidentally, and is unintentionally good

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:45.404
at his job. Can't seem to escape his lot in life
and believes he fails nearly every time, but each

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:50.445
attempt sets off a Rube Goldberg device-like
series of events and then it succeeds,

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:52.744
or fails spectacularly.

00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:57.706
Or warlocks are well-established for their
marrying their fate to darker entities in exchange

00:01:57.706 --> 00:02:02.943
for power. What if they bound themselves to an
evil creature irrevocably for both sides, and

00:02:02.943 --> 00:02:08.398
continue to try to use the dark powers for super
good! Saving kittens from trees or feeding the

00:02:08.398 --> 00:02:15.184
poor! The results can vary, and get bloody
sometimes. Or paladins! They're often expected to

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:21.244
be bastions of holy goodness and Superman-like
blandness. I fight this theory. Imagine a paladin

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:26.205
who is super down and nihilistic, while their
deity truly believes they are a worthy vessel who

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:30.523
just needs a push. They fight evil out of habit
and boredom, their weapon strikes almost

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:35.343
puppeteered by divine influence as they seek the
will and inspiration to care again.

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:39.624
I also wish to reach out to you players who lament
rolling low stats and character creation.

00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:45.433 line:1
Especially one really low stat. That shit is a
gift! Oh my god, my favorite characters to GM or

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:50.575 line:1
play as are generally useless at one or many
things. Lean into that. Put it somewhere

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:54.893
uncomfortable for your normal roleplaying space,
and see where it pushes you as a player. Maybe

00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:58.644
don't make an ability score that is central to
your class too low, so as to make it

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:03.243
non-functional, but consider that it can be a lot
of fun to start off as a bard who is actually

00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:09.244
really bad at dancing, but insists they'll get
better with practice. And they just might.

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:12.993 line:1
There are also ways to dress up the capabilities
of your class to narratively function entirely

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:18.164 line:1
different than expected, though the mechanics of
the system remain unchanged. For instance, what if

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:22.695
a wizard is instead an arcane shaman from a
now-ruined nation, destroyed by their arrogance

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:27.784
long ago. Instead of a spellbook, they carry a bag
of animal bones and arrange them every morning in

00:03:27.784 --> 00:03:32.374
succession to take spell inspiration gifts from
their ancestors, or spell memorization, as we know

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:36.885
it normally. Spellcasting is not a network of
sigils, but the spirits of their bloodline

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:42.493
manifesting to defend it. A barbarian doesn't need
to be Conan, but could be instead a blue-collar

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:47.684
miner who lost his job, his wife left him, his one
son turned 17 and absconded with his savings, and

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:52.342
finally he just snapped. He's now a wandering,
broken man with a chip on his shoulder and a need

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:56.574
to lash out at the world. Go watch the movie
Falling Down for inspiration. It's a really great

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:58.664
movie. You should really check it out.

00:03:58.664 --> 00:04:03.426
These are all some fun ideas to mix up the
standard expectations of fantasy RPGs and these

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:08.125
ideas and suggestions extend to all other genres
as well. So have fun, find your own weird

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:12.385
character themes, and enjoy the stories that
follow, because they will, and they'll be

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:16.604
memorable. Thank you so much for watching. I hope
you enjoyed and learned something from this

00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:21.054 line:1
