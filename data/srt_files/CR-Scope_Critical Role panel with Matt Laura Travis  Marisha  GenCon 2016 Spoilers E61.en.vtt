NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:13.307
(dramatic music)

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:34.730
MATT: All right, then. Good morning and welcome,
everyone, to this year's Critical Role panel.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.566
(cheering)

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:46.101
MATT: Some of us have slept. Some maybe not have
fared so well, so prepare for--

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:48.087
AUDIENCE MEMBER: One point of exhaustion!

00:00:48.087 --> 00:00:52.022
TRAVIS: One point of exhaustion!

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:54.556
(laughter)

00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:55.755
MATT: It has begun.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.429
LAURA: With a low constitution.

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.326
MARISHA: I already have a low charisma. That's not
good.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:05.696
TRAVIS: Yeah, we played a game in between live
streams, and these are all the surviving members.

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:08.760
LAURA: Spoilers!

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.115
MATT: Can you imagine what would happen if you
played a game not on the stream and came in like,

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:27.022
"Man, that was a crazy adventure! Anyway." Sam
shows up with a new character.

00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:36.598
LAURA: Every time the chair tips forward, I feel
like we're going to fall.

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:44.444
MATT: As an introduction to the panel, who here
doesn't know what Critical Role is? Raise your hand.

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:57.138
(cheering)

00:01:57.138 --> 00:02:03.271
MATT: That's an impressive ratio. Critical Role is
a weekly--

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:07.498
MARISHA: One guy, one guy.

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:13.480
MATT: It's a weekly stream where us and a couple
of other voice actors play Dungeons & Dragons.

00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:17.735
MARISHA: I'm sure he didn't hear enough about it
in line.

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:19.603
MATT: I'm just trying to make sure!

00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:24.822
MARISHA: Oh, jeez, sorry. That person. Can't see.
It's blinding up here.

00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:29.173
MATT: Yeah, that light is in our face. Anyway, we
play Dungeons & Dragons. We're voice actors. We're

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:31.894
huge nerds. And we're here at GenCon for the first
time!

00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:42.496
(cheering)

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:49.302
MATT: Well, for <i>some</i> of us it's our first time,
Miss Special Bailey. Which, by the way, have you

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:53.501
guys read her amazing backstory article?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.935
LAURA: I sent that to Matt. When was it that
we--?

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:01.619
MATT: Something like two and a half, three years
ago, yeah.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.725
LAURA: Right when we first started playing. I was
so nervous when I sent it to him. I remember you

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:09.628
didn't reply right away, and I was like, (pretends
to sob).

00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:14.364
MATT: I think it worked out okay.

00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:18.780
MARISHA: You've been chosen for the young mothers'
club.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.365
AUDIENCE: Trinket's the best!

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:33.751
MATT: (moans) I get to be a grizzly bear on the
internet. It's the weirdest shit ever.

00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:36.582
LAURA: So what should we do on this panel?

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:44.827
MATT: Do you want to make this a Q&A? General
discussion hangout? That sounds fun.

00:03:44.827 --> 00:03:48.792
LAURA: A dance party? Can it be a dance party?

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:52.842
MATT: Yeah, you want to start?

00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:53.832
LAURA: What, a dance party?

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:55.991
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:55.991 --> 00:04:00.603
LAURA: (beatboxes softly) Who's coming on Saturday
to our show?

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:07.663
TRAVIS: Who doesn't know what our show on Saturday
night is?

00:04:08.023 --> 00:04:10.073
MARISHA and TRAVIS: What?!

00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:14.831
MARISHA: Okay, so what our show is--

00:04:18.302 --> 00:04:25.628
MATT: So for that one person, if you're not busy
Saturday at 8 PM, there's a way-too-big theater

00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:33.049
that we're playing Dungeons & Dragons in that is
not at all intimidating for us. We were sent

00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:39.695
photos of the sheer volume of chairs in that place
for us to roll dice and mess around.

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:42.669
TRAVIS: We're going to be naked!

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.368
MATT: <i>Travis</i> is going to be naked.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:55.274
MARISHA: You're like the drummer in No Doubt. Just
the one naked guy.

00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:01.435
LAURA: Should we answer questions?

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:03.265
MATT: Yes!

00:05:03.265 --> 00:05:07.783
MARISHA: What is that? That was amazing.

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:10.294
LAURA: Oh, a wing just flew up into the air.

00:05:10.294 --> 00:05:11.695
MATT: Oh, it's your brother.

00:05:11.695 --> 00:05:14.254
MARISHA: Oh, it's your brother!

00:05:14.254 --> 00:05:17.489
TRAVIS: Oh, snapdragon. That's awesome.

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:33.429
(cheering)

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:36.596
LAURA: Too bad they didn't do a Vex one.

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Want to try it on?

00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:48.311
LAURA: What! Can I? Does it fly? Can I fly?

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:50.747
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can fly. Get up here on the
stage.

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:53.015
(laughter)

00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:58.584
MATT: Just jump off or have Gilmore push you.

00:05:58.584 --> 00:06:02.080
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Gilmore's here, too!

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.536
LAURA: You guys keep talking.

00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:08.370
TRAVIS: So do we have them line up over there?
Okay, if you have a question, Claudia's got a

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.989
microphone over there, and then we will answer the
questions. Or attack you.

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:20.175
MATT: Massive rough exodus.

00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:22.356
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No running! Walk!

00:06:22.356 --> 00:06:32.914
TRAVIS: No running! There's a Chowazord over
there. I don't know. Is that far off from what

00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:34.466
they're called?

00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:35.699
MARISHA: It's better.

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.947
TRAVIS: There's a Dingleberry on the loose!

00:06:38.947 --> 00:06:43.506
MATT: Y'all feel real dumb when Pokemon
X-Y-Gold-Ruby comes out next year with a

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:46.220
Charzord.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.756
MARISHA: Chowazord. I imagine it looks like a
little chow-chow.

00:06:51.756 --> 00:06:55.590
TRAVIS: All right, while Laura's getting dressed,
we'll take on one.

00:06:56.693 --> 00:06:59.525
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, you guys. It's really weird
seeing you guys in person after seeing you on screen.

00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:02.062
TRAVIS: I know. We're so much better-looking.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.293
MATT: Curiously small.

00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:05.977
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I thought you were taller.

00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:07.404
MARISHA: What?

00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.229
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I thought Travis was going to be
a little taller.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.563
TRAVIS: What?

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:20.433
(laughter and applause)

00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:22.383
TRAVIS: I've never heard that.

00:07:22.383 --> 00:07:27.674
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You sit next to Laura, and with
the height difference, you seem so much taller.

00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:30.693
TRAVIS: I sit on phone books!

00:07:30.693 --> 00:07:33.923
MARISHA: Is that better? Does that make you feel
more comfortable?

00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:41.032
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is, you guys played
for a long time off-stream before you guys ever

00:07:41.032 --> 00:07:43.495
recorded on the Twitch.

00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:45.856
LAURA: Wait, I've got to go over here.

00:07:45.856 --> 00:07:58.004
(laughter and applause)

00:07:58.004 --> 00:07:59.484
LAURA: Do I look as cool as I feel?

00:07:59.484 --> 00:08:09.963
TRAVIS: No. Hold the wing out! No, more that way.

00:08:09.963 --> 00:08:17.760
(laughter)

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.112
MATT: That's really, really cool. So your
question?

00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:29.063
MARISHA: How has been playing on Twitch different
from playing our home game?

00:08:29.063 --> 00:08:31.804
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Has it changed decisions and
things, knowing people are going to judge

00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:34.617
everything you do?

00:08:36.622 --> 00:08:43.793
TRAVIS: Well, it changed it a little bit. We try
and keep the dumb pauses that would normally

00:08:43.793 --> 00:08:48.659
happen in our seven-hour home games, where we're
eating chips and drinking all the time. And

00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:53.034
sometimes, if it's not us, we'd get up, and walk
off into the kitchen, and eat a bunch of cookies

00:08:53.034 --> 00:08:58.665
and shit. So we try to get rid of that stuff, but
whether we make stupid decisions? I make those

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:01.982
<i>all</i> the time.

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:07.250
MATT: Yeah. Vox Machina's ability to formulate a
plan and then succeed in executing it have not

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:15.126
changed. They've always failed, and yet somehow
succeeded in the end. But yeah, other than a

00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:23.292
difference in small talk and probably the-- no,
Sam's always been as weird as he is. Not much has

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:25.975
changed beyond that. It's been nice.

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:29.094
LAURA: Are we talking about how weird Sam is?

00:09:29.094 --> 00:09:33.426
MATT: How things have changed or not changed from
doing private games to the stream.

00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:40.966
LAURA: Did we talk about all the food we ate?
Because we ate so much food.

00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:43.018
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is that a Tiberius impression
right now?

00:09:43.018 --> 00:09:44.034
LAURA: What?

00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:46.301
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That your Tiberius impression
right now?

00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:54.144
MATT: I do miss the morning D&D mimosas a little
bit. We're never going to get that back.

00:09:54.144 --> 00:09:56.723
MARISHA: And the smoked salmon and lox.

00:09:56.723 --> 00:09:58.550
LAURA: We had a whole brunch.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.947
MATT: We've got to bring that back.

00:10:00.947 --> 00:10:03.444
LAURA: I would make quiches for us.

00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:08.662
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, the quiche!

00:10:08.662 --> 00:10:12.365
TRAVIS: Can we go shopping right now?

00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:15.158
(laughter)

00:10:15.158 --> 00:10:22.292
TRAVIS: There's more emotional stuff once the
stream started, that's for sure. The first time

00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:28.035
somebody started crying, even I was like, "What
the fuck is happening?"

00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:33.426
MATT: That's not true. When Ashley went down
pre-stream, there was some emotion in that sequence.

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:39.445
MARISHA: We can remember more now than we used to
because we're playing regularly, whereas before we

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:44.253
played every six weeks or so. We'd take the first
30 minutes to be like, "Matt, tell us what all we

00:10:44.253 --> 00:10:47.015
"did. Everything."

00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:54.118
MATT: I'm so glad we're past that. Next question!

00:10:54.118 --> 00:10:55.222
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Love you guys.

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:57.295
MATT: Love you too!

00:10:57.295 --> 00:11:01.212
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First, watching your show got me
actually into playing Dungeons & Dragons.

00:11:01.212 --> 00:11:05.813
(cheering)

00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:12.411
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Given the popularity of a number
of things becoming more mainstream, the popularity

00:11:12.411 --> 00:11:17.512
of TV shows like The League, have you guys thought
about making a TV show or web series based off

00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:23.131
your Critical Role outside-of-character in the
game and in-character playing?

00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:25.221
MARISHA: Reality-style?

00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:29.048
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! Reality-style.

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:33.551
LAURA: I've always wanted cameras following me
around.

00:11:33.551 --> 00:11:39.074
MARISHA: It did get talked about at one point, but
it didn't go forward. Part of it is because we

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:44.163
were like-- and then there is also that part where
we were like, "Ah, what's really exciting on that

00:11:44.163 --> 00:11:51.541
"three and a half, four hours on screen, that's
awesome! We're really boring all other times. I

00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:55.455
"don't know if we want to expose that. We're not
that cool."

00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:59.724
MATT: Some of those cameras follow me back to my
office. They can watch me tear my hair out trying

00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:02.152
to create interesting stories for you guys.

00:12:02.152 --> 00:12:05.494
LAURA: See, that actually sounds more interesting.
If they follow me and Travis home, they would get

00:12:05.494 --> 00:12:09.354
us laying on our carpet playing with Charlie.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:12.099
MATT: We'd have to put pants on!

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.454
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No, you wouldn't!

00:12:14.454 --> 00:12:22.711
MATT: We'll see where it goes. The popularity has
been unexpected, but at the same time we want to

00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:26.414
make sure that, if there's going to be anything
that comes out of this, that it's on-brand, and

00:12:26.414 --> 00:12:33.317
doesn't feel like it's capitalizing on the show,
and is more a natural expansion of it. So we'll

00:12:33.317 --> 00:12:38.317
see. We definitely don't want to jump out of the
gate and be like, "You guys like this? Well, try

00:12:38.317 --> 00:12:41.164
"the new breakfast cereal!"

00:12:41.164 --> 00:12:47.005
LAURA: I think that Scanlan should hawk all of
that stuff. It's on-brand for him.

00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:49.774
TRAVIS: I think we should have some breakfast
cereal.

00:12:49.774 --> 00:12:52.194
LAURA: Gilmore's Glorious Granola?

00:12:52.194 --> 00:12:54.062
MATT: Vox Machi-nums?

00:12:54.062 --> 00:12:59.492
(cheering)

00:12:59.492 --> 00:13:02.662
MATT: You don't know what you've done, Scope!

00:13:02.662 --> 00:13:07.956
TRAVIS: Come get at us, General Mills. We'll make
this happen.

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:12.667
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First of all, thank you for
coming here as, obviously, we're not in LA, so

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.788
it's nice to see you here at the con. I have a
question for Matt. I'm looking for a reliable

00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:20.923
source of black powder somewhere in Vasselheim.

00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:29.462
MATT: There's a guy who was on Craigslist once.
That always ends well. Actually, I think the black

00:13:29.462 --> 00:13:36.396
powder merchant encounter is the best example you
can have of fantasy Craigslist in a D&D setting.

00:13:36.396 --> 00:13:41.499
That's usually par for the course, which is a guy
going, "Want to buy a couch? Come and take a

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:57.572
"couch!" I have never had an NPC be forcefully
dragged by a community into other games. Victor

00:13:57.572 --> 00:14:13.095
has been pulled into stuff. "Yes, anytime, please
come buy things! Learn from my mistakes!" I love

00:14:13.095 --> 00:14:18.784
that Keyleth doesn't quite know that he's missing
limbs because she can probably fix it.

00:14:18.784 --> 00:14:20.232
MARISHA: I don't think I've ever--

00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:24.454
MATT: You've never met him in game, yeah. And
Percy doesn't know you haven't.

00:14:24.454 --> 00:14:26.236
LAURA: You can fix people's limbs?

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:28.351
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:34.099
LAURA: Wait, did you have that when Vax had no
toes?

00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:35.915
MARISHA: No.

00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:42.418
MATT: It's a 6th- or 7th-level spell. So you lose
a finger--

00:14:42.418 --> 00:14:45.510
TRAVIS: So I can chop off my arm.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:51.268
MARISHA: Dude, it's not like-- don't-- no.

00:14:51.268 --> 00:14:59.285
TRAVIS: I'm a great guinea pig! What if I chop off
my head?

00:14:59.285 --> 00:15:03.400
MARISHA: It doesn't fix instant death.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.456
MATT: You still have to be alive for it to work.
Although I will say I do love the idea of Grog

00:15:07.456 --> 00:15:10.727
normally proportioned with one tiny baby arm
growing out.

00:15:10.727 --> 00:15:14.376
(laughter)

00:15:14.376 --> 00:15:17.145
MATT: Tiny hand.

00:15:19.465 --> 00:15:23.263
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First off, thank you for what
y'all have done in letting us enjoy your show.

00:15:23.263 --> 00:15:25.467
Thank you for playing and for letting us be a part
of that.

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:26.399
TRAVIS: You're welcome!

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:27.835
LAURA: Thank you.

00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:32.905
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question moreso on the
aspect of if one of the characters were ever to go down--

00:15:32.905 --> 00:15:36.076
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:40.906
AUDIENCE MEMBER: --what you would bring in as your
alternate character, or in another campaign where

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:44.978
you can't come back. Bye, Travis.

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:51.658
MATT: (evil laughter)

00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:54.228
MARISHA: It's like Survivor, man.

00:15:54.228 --> 00:16:05.130
MATT: I like you! What would you guys want to come
back as, if you have any idea?

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:11.208
MARISHA: It's hard, because we want it to be a
surprise, and also I think our idea changes from

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:18.506
day to day. I know we've all said they'd be the
total opposites of whatever we're playing now.

00:16:18.506 --> 00:16:19.807
TRAVIS: I'd be a tavern wench.

00:16:19.807 --> 00:16:25.574
(laughter)

00:16:25.574 --> 00:16:28.192
TRAVIS: I'd sleep with everybody.

00:16:28.192 --> 00:16:33.477
(laughter)

00:16:33.477 --> 00:16:36.714
TRAVIS: Sex is important!

00:16:36.714 --> 00:16:46.407
MATT: It's a way to get experience. Just work your
way to level four, man.

00:16:46.407 --> 00:16:49.618
LAURA: I would want magic. I want to be able to
play with magic a little more. Although I know

00:16:49.618 --> 00:16:52.806
it's so freaking complicated.

00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:59.562
MATT: It's really not that complicated when you
get into it! The choices are broad, yes, and that

00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:02.895
can be a little intimidating, but once you make
those choices, especially when you pick a class

00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:06.345
that maybe has a little more limited scope with
spell choices, like the sorcerer or bard or

00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:09.678
something like that, it's not that bad. If you're
a wizard, then yeah, you've got to be ready to

00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:11.737
have that encyclopedia at your disposal.

00:17:11.737 --> 00:17:13.146
LAURA: That's why they have the book, right?

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:18.903
MATT: Yeah. Wizards have the book because they can
be like, "All right. What am I learning today?"

00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:24.206
Everyone else in the party goes, "Ugh. Another
round of bacon, I guess."

00:17:24.206 --> 00:17:31.058
LAURA: Fried chicken! Is that Percy?

00:17:31.058 --> 00:17:32.275
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It is!

00:17:32.275 --> 00:17:33.937
MATT: There's a Percy, that's awesome!

00:17:33.937 --> 00:17:38.525
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's my first attempt at a
cosplay and I forgot my jacket at home.

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:42.417
MATT: As long as you bring in the butt flap,
you're fine.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:53.902
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First of all, hello from central
Pennsylvania. The second thing is, my little

00:17:53.902 --> 00:17:57.307
sister would kill me, this is a letter and gift
for Laura Bailey.

00:17:57.307 --> 00:18:02.087
LAURA: (gasps) Should I come down there?

00:18:02.087 --> 00:18:03.709
TRAVIS: Sit down!

00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:05.675
(laughter)

00:18:05.675 --> 00:18:14.864
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And finally, my question is for
Matt. In the campaign that I run, we're using the

00:18:14.864 --> 00:18:20.630
gunslinger that you made. I know that you and
Taliesin worked together on a lot of his

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:28.468
inventions and gadgets that he makes. What's the
process you go through with him so that he can

00:18:28.468 --> 00:18:34.658
create these amazing things like Diplomacy and Bad
News and that kind of stuff but you keep it balanced?

00:18:35.086 --> 00:18:41.475
MATT: Right. What he'll do is he'll sketch up an
idea, whether it be an actual small drawing or

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:44.991
just the idea behind what he wants to create and
the effect that he wants, and he'll bring that to

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:50.193
me via email or personal discussion. I'll think
about it, and I'll think in terms of what could be

00:18:50.193 --> 00:18:56.060
balanced for his level and what kind of things he
can do without it being a way-too-good ability for

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:02.247
his class beyond what's normally capable. For the
most part, tinkering is about utility and helpful

00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:07.616
things, not to really strengthen the class. The
one exception was Bad News and that was the one

00:19:07.616 --> 00:19:11.932
thing that I worked with him that he spent his
entire six-month time jump working on. Where

00:19:11.932 --> 00:19:16.320
everyone else was having side adventures and doing
story stuff, he's like, "I spent six months in my

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:22.290
workshop trying to make this. I spent all my money
on it, and it still might fail on the rolls." He

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:28.842
managed to succeed. Once he gets the concept, I'll
go ahead and think out, many times scaling it back

00:19:28.842 --> 00:19:35.380
to what is balanced and I'll write up what I think
it should do. Then I'll give him a series of costs

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:41.469
and checks he has to make for it. If it's more of
a giant, powerful, strength-based tinkering

00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:44.783
ability where he has to manipulate a lot of heavy
metals, it'll be more of a strength-based

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:48.821
tinkering check where you take the tinkering bonus
and the strength modifier. If it's tinier, more

00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:53.322
intricate clockwork-style, it's more of a
dexterity-based tinkering check. You change

00:19:53.322 --> 00:20:00.039
whatever ability modifier applies to that roll
based on the kind of task that it is. The DC I

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:07.318
decide essentially based on how intricate and how
good the final product is supposed to be and how

00:20:07.318 --> 00:20:11.661
good his rolls are if it's a progressive series of
rolls. If he keeps failing rolls, that final and

00:20:11.661 --> 00:20:16.631
third DC check I'll make pretty damn high. So he
still has a chance to succeed, but it gets smaller

00:20:16.631 --> 00:20:22.921
and smaller the more he fails the progressive
attempts. It's relatively fluid. It's based

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:27.990
case-to-case, because, honestly, the tinkering
rules are kind of vague. But they're intentionally

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:33.263
vague by the system so you can do what I do and
create your own way of letting them occur. I think

00:20:33.263 --> 00:20:37.758
it's a cool system 5th edition has done, they've
given you the tools to figure out in some cases

00:20:37.758 --> 00:20:42.177
however you want to try and make it function,
which I like.

00:20:42.177 --> 00:20:43.213
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you so much!

00:20:43.213 --> 00:20:45.281
TRAVIS: Did you get all that?

00:20:45.281 --> 00:20:46.815
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Iron trap.

00:20:46.815 --> 00:20:48.409
MATT: Good, good!

00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:51.698
TRAVIS: I just heard, "Mwa mwa mwa mwa."

00:20:51.698 --> 00:20:53.450
MATT: The point when Travis just glazes over.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:59.119
LAURA: Tell your sister I said thank you! She made
this out of a quarter! I know, right?

00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:02.041
MATT: That's really cool.

00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:08.341
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Maybe like a lot of people
here, thanks to Critical Role, I'm cutting my

00:21:08.341 --> 00:21:16.759
teeth on DMing. I'm pretty long-winded as a
person, and I know that, so it works for and

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:24.182
against me as the DM. From your perspective, do
you ever experience when you're trying to explain

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:28.520
something and you're a couple of minutes into it,
you've got this awesome idea and you're trying to

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:37.906
explain it to your group and you find that maybe
their eyes are glazing over. It's in my head, I'm

00:21:37.906 --> 00:21:42.105
trying to show it to you, but maybe you feel like
you're going too long. How do you balance your,

00:21:42.105 --> 00:21:47.174
I've got to describe this scene and this area, but
what details are really pertinent?

00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:55.325
MATT: Being concise. It's one of the things that
comes with experience as well. You may have an

00:21:55.325 --> 00:22:01.123
extremely elaborate write-up for certain
circumstances. It's also the presentation aspect

00:22:01.123 --> 00:22:06.165
of it, too. I've gone into a few backstory
diatribes with you guys, exposition on certain

00:22:06.165 --> 00:22:10.452
NPCs because you would ask the right questions,
and you can still keep your attention as long as

00:22:10.452 --> 00:22:14.172
you say it with conviction. It's the difference
between going, (monotone) "And then the gods

00:22:14.172 --> 00:22:18.873
"created the land, and then there was the place
that happened and the people went 'yay'," and

00:22:18.873 --> 00:22:29.919
going, (forcefully) "And then the gods created the
land, and the people went, 'Yay!'" As long as

00:22:30.317 --> 00:22:34.875
you're engaged with the eye contact and
confidence, it'll generally keep people engaged

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:40.656
more often, a kind of oratory speech foundation.
Half of it's not even what you say, it's just how

00:22:40.656 --> 00:22:44.805
you say it and being concise with the details.
When you finish writing up a description of a new

00:22:44.805 --> 00:22:48.994
location, go back through it again and be like,
"How can I eliminate a few of these sentences? How

00:22:48.994 --> 00:22:54.726
"can I use different adjectives?" And by the way,
thesaurus.com is your friend! Both to learn new,

00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:59.577
cool vocabulary words, but as a way to truncate
the ideas you're trying to get across.

00:22:59.577 --> 00:23:01.643
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and LAURA: Truncate?

00:23:01.643 --> 00:23:05.710
MATT: Truncate. Truncate's a word! It's a good
word!

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.880
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Cool.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:14.064
MATT: Take a moment to go through what you've put
down and find ways to condense it a little

00:23:14.064 --> 00:23:19.603
tighter. And when you do say it to your party,
conviction.

00:23:19.603 --> 00:23:21.082
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Cool, thank you.

00:23:21.082 --> 00:23:31.508
MARISHA: I like that answer. Truncate. Go ahead.

00:23:31.508 --> 00:23:35.812
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question requires a little bit
of background. I didn't start playing D&D until

00:23:35.812 --> 00:23:42.368
after college. I always thought of it as some sort
of competitive game, where you're competing to get

00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:47.677
levels and loot and then one man is making
arbitrary decisions about who will succeed or not.

00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:50.629
MATT: And Steven wins!

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:59.480
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Exactly. It didn't make any sense
to me. Recently when I took it as more group

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.996
storytelling it really clicked. I went, "Oh,
that's awesome!" I started watching shows-- yours,

00:24:03.996 --> 00:24:09.249
of course-- and I've learned a lot of lessons.
I've tried to take everything I can, any cool

00:24:09.249 --> 00:24:14.037
ideas, to try to bring into my own games. The
number one thing I take from your show, believe it

00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:19.977
or not, is I love the way you guys cheer each
other on. It's something I bring into my own games

00:24:19.977 --> 00:24:24.015
that makes them so much better if you're
constantly cheering for one another, and I've

00:24:24.015 --> 00:24:30.806
found that when I do it, everybody has a much
better time. My question is, do you have anything

00:24:30.806 --> 00:24:36.036
you do, a mindset you bring in or tips and tricks
you use to make sure the experience is fun for

00:24:36.036 --> 00:24:40.305
everybody? Because that, I think, is the most
important part, and I think you do it so well that

00:24:40.305 --> 00:24:43.566
that's why maybe your show is greater than a lot
of people's.

00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:45.267
MARISHA: Aw, thanks man.

00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:53.527
TRAVIS: I remember the very first time we ever
played, Matt took me aside in some room because--

00:24:53.527 --> 00:24:56.156
was it Laura and I were talking to that guy?

00:24:56.156 --> 00:24:58.945
LAURA: Oh, yeah, and you intimidated him, right?

00:24:58.945 --> 00:25:04.979
TRAVIS: He was like, "How do you want to
intimidate him?" And I was like: "I don't-- What

00:25:04.979 --> 00:25:06.157
"was his question?"

00:25:06.157 --> 00:25:07.313
(laughter)

00:25:07.313 --> 00:25:09.437
TRAVIS: I was like: "Can I do anything?" And he
was like: "You can certainly try."

00:25:09.437 --> 00:25:11.927
(laughter)

00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:14.906
TRAVIS: We were back in the bedroom in your
apartment, right? We were waiting for the rest of

00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:15.425
the table.

00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:16.216
MATT: It was the whole plan.

00:25:16.216 --> 00:25:16.716
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:25:16.716 --> 00:25:19.617
(laughter)

00:25:19.617 --> 00:25:24.788
TRAVIS: I reached down, and grabbed him by the
throat, and picked him up and he was going: (makes

00:25:25.078 --> 00:25:27.038
choking noises). I was like, wow, this is great!

00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:29.576
(laughter)

00:25:29.576 --> 00:25:33.140
TRAVIS: I asked him later: "Is there anything that
you don't like about certain aspects of the game?"

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:38.393
He's like: "Only when people play it safe. Don't
play it safe. Safe can be so boring, you know.

00:25:38.393 --> 00:25:43.000
"It's a fantasy world, it's your imagination, there
are all these things happening. So don't play it

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.446
"safe." I'm like: "Got it."

00:25:44.446 --> 00:25:47.128
(laughter)

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:54.261
LAURA: I think it also helps that the whole party,
we're all friends and we genuinely want to cheer

00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:59.426
each other on and encourage each other. You know,
when Grog has a fight with just one other person,

00:25:59.426 --> 00:26:04.460
we genuinely are interested and are watching it
and supporting him. And, you know, Scanlan turning

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:11.560
into a rhinoceros. We haven't said anything for an
hour, but it was one of the best games I remember

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.841
playing because it was so much fun to watch him do
all those crazy things.

00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:16.251
TRAVIS: Yeah, we turned into the crowd.

00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:21.000
MARISHA: It's kind of interesting. I'd never
really thought about it before-- you were talking

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.110
about cheering each other on. But it's kind of
like supporting your buddies at the gym. Come on,

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.421
bro. You've got this!

00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:32.558
MATT: A few more reps. Go! Go! Go!

00:26:32.558 --> 00:26:41.491
MARISHA: Come on! Don't quit! So I think it does
create maybe a different kind of support structure.

00:26:45.283 --> 00:26:50.653
MATT: As a Dungeon Master, it helps to instill the
idea that, "By the way, guys, if one of you does

00:26:50.653 --> 00:26:56.624
"poorly, that's going to mess up all of you." So
you want this guy to succeed because it only helps

00:26:56.624 --> 00:27:04.405
all of you. It's kind of your job as a Dungeon
Master to help sculpt a story that promotes unity

00:27:04.405 --> 00:27:10.514
in the group as well. It's fun at certain times to
instill tension in the group, it's likely to

00:27:10.514 --> 00:27:15.477
happen naturally, but <i>because</i> it happens
naturally sometimes, you have to try and

00:27:15.477 --> 00:27:22.331
facilitate that idea of everyone working together
as friends and supporting each other. So try your

00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:26.003
best and, at least in the earlier parts of the
campaign, to not try and pit players against each

00:27:26.003 --> 00:27:30.790
other, because it can breed unfortunate emotions.
When they're comfortable in their space, been

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.082
playing for a while, and they all have built out
the core, that's when you can tweak it here and

00:27:34.082 --> 00:27:40.406
there for those cool story moments. But you still
want to facilitate, as the head storyteller that--

00:27:40.406 --> 00:27:41.264
LAURA: As a Master.

00:27:41.264 --> 00:27:48.294
MATT: As a Master, if you will. To make sure that,
to succeed and continue, friendship is the answer!

00:27:48.294 --> 00:27:51.675
(laughter)

00:27:51.675 --> 00:27:55.004
TRAVIS: There were moments of conflict that were
fun, though. When Percy tried to keep me from

00:27:55.004 --> 00:27:59.365
getting the skull, we were both smiling our asses
off.

00:27:59.365 --> 00:28:05.325
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's another thing. Even when
you have conflict, I think a lot of times, it

00:28:05.325 --> 00:28:10.543
tears the fucking party apart. You keep just being
able to do it and still feel okay with it.

00:28:10.543 --> 00:28:11.562
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:11.562 --> 00:28:12.754
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How do you all do that?

00:28:12.754 --> 00:28:16.777
MARISHA: I think Matt touched on this a little
bit, but keeping in mind that there is not a whole

00:28:16.777 --> 00:28:22.515
lot of opportunities for group co-op games. So
keep that in mind and really utilize it as a team.

00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:32.088
I'm trying not to make it sound awful. I mean it.
Whatever, just have fun.

00:28:32.088 --> 00:28:42.799
(laughter and applause)

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:43.589
MATT: Hello!

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:47.017
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! Welcome to GenCon or, in
Laura's case, welcome back!

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:47.885
LAURA: Thank you, thank you.

00:28:47.885 --> 00:28:49.778
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What do you guys think so far?

00:28:49.778 --> 00:28:56.652
MATT: It's awesome. I've only seen the exhibition
hall peripherally, but even glancing through, I'm

00:28:56.652 --> 00:29:03.884
like, I should have brought another piece of
luggage, man. After this, hopefully, I have this

00:29:03.884 --> 00:29:07.151
three-hour pack where I'll be like-- and I
apologize in advance if you see me wandering, and

00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:11.614
you approach me, and I'm like, "No, I'm fine."
It's nothing against you, it's just that I have

00:29:11.614 --> 00:29:16.139
very short periods of time to actually enjoy the
exhibition hall, and I really, literally, just

00:29:16.139 --> 00:29:17.847
wanted to buy everything.

00:29:17.847 --> 00:29:19.053
(laughter)

00:29:19.053 --> 00:29:20.535
MATT: I'm going to go broke in there.

00:29:20.535 --> 00:29:24.222
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, my actual question is: What
do you think--

00:29:24.222 --> 00:29:28.975
(laughter)

00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.162
MATT: Sorry, what was that?

00:29:30.162 --> 00:29:33.768
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So what inspired you to create
your individual characters and what drew you to

00:29:33.768 --> 00:29:35.093
wanting to be a DM?

00:29:35.093 --> 00:29:38.046
MATT: What inspired you to make your individual
characters?

00:29:38.046 --> 00:29:39.493
MARISHA: What inspired us?

00:29:39.493 --> 00:29:40.016
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:41.235
MARISHA: You go first.

00:29:41.235 --> 00:29:45.617
TRAVIS: After one look at the Player's Handbook
and was like: "What the fuck is this?"

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:47.645
(laughter)

00:29:47.645 --> 00:29:50.955
TRAVIS: This is the most complicated and
intimidating thing I've ever seen in my life. Like

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:58.384
cantrips and spell levels. I was like: "Matt, what
do I do just to hit things?" He said: "Well, you

00:29:58.384 --> 00:30:02.108
"could be a fighter, or a monk, or a barbarian."
I'm like: "Barbarian! Good! They're usually dumb."

00:30:02.108 --> 00:30:08.343
He's like: "Not necessarily." Then we rolled the
character and I got an intelligence of six, and I

00:30:08.343 --> 00:30:09.679
was like: "Money!"

00:30:10.274 --> 00:30:18.794
(laughter)

00:30:18.794 --> 00:30:20.165
TRAVIS: He's named Grog, duh.

00:30:23.915 --> 00:30:26.273
MARISHA: Is there any water in the house, Fabio?

00:30:26.273 --> 00:30:29.681
MARISHA and LAURA: That's what we're all saying.

00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:41.132
LAURA: I wanted to be a rogue, and I wanted to be
a half-elf. And then Liam told me he was a rogue

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:46.421
already. And I was really angry, and then he said
he was already a half-elf and I was also really

00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:55.672
angry. So I asked Matt, "So the two things I'm
thinking of being are a druid or a ranger. Which

00:30:55.672 --> 00:31:09.824
"one of these gets to have an animal?" And he said,
"Both." I was like, "Shit!" What was I saying? So

00:31:09.824 --> 00:31:13.493
I said I'll be a ranger, and then I was like,
"Hey, Liam, I still want to be a half-elf, but we

00:31:13.493 --> 00:31:18.621
"actually have the same birthday in real life, so
maybe we could be twins in the game, too?" And he

00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:20.169
said, "Yeah, I like it," so we did that.

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:24.393
TRAVIS: Then you came up with those damn names.

00:31:24.393 --> 00:31:32.181
LAURA: Vex has been a name that I always go to
whenever I'm playing any of my many video games. I

00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:36.610
always like meanings, I don't know why. Vex is one
I already went to. And so: "I'm going to be

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:42.562
"Vex'ahlia!" and he's like: "Fine, I want to be...
Vax'ildan?" "As long as there's an apostrophe in

00:31:42.562 --> 00:31:43.541
"it, we're good."

00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:45.822
MATT: I think that was an early omen.

00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:48.749
MARISHA: Was it you or Liam who was really adamant
about the apostrophes?

00:31:48.749 --> 00:31:49.260
LAURA: Me.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:58.952
MARISHA: Okay, I also had an apostrophe. I came in
last, because I actually helped the first game,

00:31:58.952 --> 00:32:05.074
and then when it turned into a campaign, I'm like:
"Okay, yeah, if this could turn into a thing, then

00:32:05.074 --> 00:32:09.383
"I'll join." So yeah, I didn't play in that first
game. I was Matt's assistant.

00:32:09.383 --> 00:32:10.480
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt's familiar.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.164
MARISHA: I basically just pointed at stats when
they were confused: "It's right there."

00:32:14.164 --> 00:32:16.484
(laughter)

00:32:21.884 --> 00:32:30.686
MARISHA: So many distractions. I was also torn
between a ranger and a druid, and Matt was like,

00:32:30.946 --> 00:32:33.393
"Well, Laura's already a ranger," and I was like:
"Cool, I'll be a druid, then."

00:32:33.393 --> 00:32:37.436
MATT: I think you tried druid in Fourth Edition,
and you hated it.

00:32:37.436 --> 00:32:42.787
MARISHA: I hated it. Yeah, I tried druid in Fourth
Edition. They were basically a watered-down

00:32:42.787 --> 00:32:48.340
support class that wasn't-- they were trying to be
a jack-of-all-trades but they just sucked at

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:58.575
everything. I hated it, so I was like: "All right,
I'll give druids one last chance." And then she's

00:32:58.575 --> 00:33:05.411
my long-time character. I was also like: "I'm
going to play a nice person. I never play nice

00:33:05.411 --> 00:33:09.320
people. It's so hard to play nice people in RPGs,
but it's a <i>one-shot</i>."

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:15.624
(laughter)

00:33:15.624 --> 00:33:21.473
MATT: I guarantee you that if Keyleth goes away or
the campaign finishes, you're going to make a

00:33:21.473 --> 00:33:22.235
character that's--

00:33:22.235 --> 00:33:31.144
MARISHA: Who's such a bitch. Awful. Selfish and
evil. I'm going to be on rumspringa, man!

00:33:31.144 --> 00:33:35.896
LAURA: You'll get along with everybody, I'm sure.

00:33:35.896 --> 00:33:41.384
MATT: To answer your question for me, I was
inspired to be a dungeon master from having a

00:33:41.695 --> 00:33:47.674
really bad dungeon master my first six months of
playing. I loved the game, I could see the

00:33:47.674 --> 00:33:51.305
potential for it-- the potential for
storytelling-- and the guy who was running was

00:33:51.305 --> 00:33:56.600
just really, really, really hard to enjoy. It
wasn't about the story more than it was: "Let's go

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.215
"kill things, and also I have my own character
who's, in second edition, a paladin, but I'm also

00:34:01.215 --> 00:34:04.356
"going to want to take the samurai fighter kit
because I'm the DM and I'm allowed to do that." So

00:34:04.356 --> 00:34:08.165
he's a samurai paladin dual-wielding magical
katanas. And also he's got his griffon mount and

00:34:08.165 --> 00:34:14.755
his holy sword, and his holy quest was, he woke up
and this guy went, "Here!" So yeah, it was very--

00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:22.115
it was a pain in the ass. And to walk away was
like: "No, go! I'm going to run my own game." So

00:34:22.115 --> 00:34:27.539
then my whole inspiration-- I was driven to do it,
because I couldn't take bad examples of it. And

00:34:27.539 --> 00:34:31.798
then I was just fumbling in the dark for years,
going: "I guess this is how it works." This is how

00:34:31.798 --> 00:34:38.085
most of us did it when there wasn't examples of
it. You newer folk have such an easier time of it!

00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:46.125
You were creating a void in a vacuum. Wow, I sound
really old and crotchety now. "Oh you youngsters,

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:59.129
you don't know what it was like! We had to do
reverse math for AC and THAC0!" We'll assume you

00:34:59.129 --> 00:35:02.652
appreciate you skipped that area, because I know
that was pretty quick. And that's basically my inspiration.

00:35:02.652 --> 00:35:07.172
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Two more things. One: Laura, I
share the same birthday.

00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:08.346
LAURA: Yeah!

00:35:08.346 --> 00:35:14.165
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And also: a few weeks ago, a
tattoo appeared on Twitter, of Critical Role, that

00:35:14.165 --> 00:35:16.394
said "How do you want to do this" and then a
question mark.

00:35:16.394 --> 00:35:19.083
MATT: Oh, no way! That was you?!

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:24.533
(laughter and applause)

00:35:24.533 --> 00:35:25.936
MATT: We were passing this around earlier.

00:35:25.936 --> 00:35:33.113
(laughter)

00:35:33.113 --> 00:35:34.155
LAURA: Whoa!

00:35:34.155 --> 00:35:35.575
MARISHA: It's all like new fresh ink.

00:35:35.575 --> 00:35:49.675
(applause)

00:35:58.135 --> 00:36:00.154
MARISHA: I love your shirt.

00:36:01.424 --> 00:36:02.687
MARISHA and LAURA: "I'm Allura!"

00:36:07.602 --> 00:36:13.030
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So my question is: if your
characters now could go back to their past selves

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:18.787
at the beginning of the campaign, and give them
one piece of advice--? Sort of the same thing for

00:36:18.787 --> 00:36:21.655
Matt: as a DM, what advice would you give?

00:36:21.655 --> 00:36:23.377
MARISHA: That's a good question.

00:36:23.377 --> 00:36:25.126
TRAVIS: Listen to the sword.

00:36:25.126 --> 00:36:38.106
(laughter)

00:36:38.106 --> 00:36:40.256
LAURA: Don't let anybody else hold the carpet.

00:36:40.256 --> 00:36:47.205
(laughter)

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:48.547
TRAVIS: She'll never let that shit go.

00:36:55.217 --> 00:36:56.695
MARISHA: So many things.

00:36:56.695 --> 00:37:03.154
(laughter)

00:37:03.632 --> 00:37:04.983
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Be nice to the elderly!

00:37:04.983 --> 00:37:07.380
TRAVIS: Be nice to the elderly?!

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:21.070
MARISHA: Stay away from children. Learn Grasping
Vine placements. That's what I would tell her. Practice.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:34.702
MATT: I'd like to tell Gilmore to open shop
further east. "Don't stand there. Try Stillben,

00:37:34.702 --> 00:37:42.051
"that's a nice time of year." I'd tell Kima to
maybe be more of a second-wave fighter-- let

00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.553
everyone else go in first.

00:37:43.553 --> 00:37:47.069
LAURA: Like, ever, Kima, every time she gets taken
out.

00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:51.101
MATT: I know, man! She's got an awesome set of
abilities I'm always excited to use, and I'm like:

00:37:51.101 --> 00:37:55.119
"Well, never mind. One day."

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:56.470
TRAVIS: Kima with the beholders, right?

00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:01.900
MATT: Kima and beholders is not a good setup, man!
She's got a thing with eyes now. It's hate fear.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:08.876
Anyone catches eye contact, she's like-- Good
question, thank you.

00:38:08.876 --> 00:38:26.156
LAURA: Hey, presents! What is that? The story
of--

00:38:26.156 --> 00:38:27.351
TRAVIS: It's cursed. Don't open it!

00:38:27.351 --> 00:38:30.450
(laughter)

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.383
TRAVIS: Trap check!

00:38:31.383 --> 00:38:34.121
LAURA: These are so cute!

00:38:34.121 --> 00:38:37.460
MATT: There's Sam with his blue poo.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.600
LAURA: Look, there's a beer behind you!

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.999
MATT: I got sunglasses.

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:49.618
LAURA: I got gold! That's awesome, thank you!

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:52.940
MARISHA: Oh man, it's all of us on our worst
days.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:59.540
MATT: Next question. We've got a long line and not
a lot of time.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:07.329
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a present for Matt after
my question. So all of you did playlists for your

00:39:07.329 --> 00:39:12.570
individual characters, and all of them seem really
good, but I'm wondering, just out of morbid

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:18.890
curiosity-- each of you-- say you had a
professional wrestler's entrance theme. What would

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:19.577
it be?

00:39:19.577 --> 00:39:31.608
(laughter)

00:39:31.608 --> 00:39:38.980
TRAVIS: I thought of that. I was in between
AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and "Shipping Up To

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:48.358
"Boston." That's the first thing I thought of on
that playlist. You, sir, are a badass.

00:39:48.358 --> 00:40:03.394
LAURA: Maybe, I don't know-- (chants) "The best
things in life are free!" I want money. That's

00:40:03.394 --> 00:40:04.525
what I want!

00:40:04.525 --> 00:40:15.388
MARISHA: See, I kind of had the version of
Strawberry Fields on there where it's like kind of

00:40:15.388 --> 00:40:21.649
my thought on that. That's like the slow-mo
soundtrack that's going on in Kiki's head as she's

00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:30.179
destroying things and stuff. Like: (singing) "Take
you down. Going to." Yeah! But if you want

00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:35.879
something more amped up maybe like (singing) "It's
the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight."

00:40:35.879 --> 00:40:41.031
(laughter)

00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:42.189
MARISHA: Yeah. One easy bite.

00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:44.479
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt, do you have one for
Gilmore?

00:40:44.479 --> 00:40:45.803
(laughter)

00:40:45.803 --> 00:40:47.790
TRAVIS: (singing) I'm too sexy for my shirt.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:53.082
(laughter)

00:40:53.082 --> 00:41:01.366
MATT: That's a good one. That's a really good one.
But something with Aretha Franklin probably. Hell,

00:41:01.366 --> 00:41:06.629
yeah. Respect, man. It would be awesome if
(singing) "R-E-S-P-E-C-T!"

00:41:06.629 --> 00:41:10.800
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have something for Matt,
because we share a love of dungeon mastering,

00:41:11.072 --> 00:41:12.664
dwarves, and dice--

00:41:12.664 --> 00:41:15.863
(music starts playing)

00:41:15.863 --> 00:41:17.463
MATT: Sorry, what was the question?

00:41:17.463 --> 00:41:22.992
AUDIENCE MEMBER: For DMing, dwarves, and dice, I
wanted to give you my Dungeon Master's dwarven dice.

00:41:22.992 --> 00:41:24.456
MATT: Are you sure, man?

00:41:24.456 --> 00:41:27.375
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As sure as I can be.

00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:28.841
TRAVIS: Those are poison, too!

00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:34.146
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Wow!

00:41:34.146 --> 00:41:35.817
LAURA: Can we all-- I don't want to touch them.
I'm scared.

00:41:35.817 --> 00:41:37.032
TRAVIS: They're warm!

00:41:37.032 --> 00:41:43.391
MATT: Very nice. They're actually metal. That's
awesome!

00:41:43.391 --> 00:41:48.124
LAURA: Roll a 20! Next question!

00:41:48.124 --> 00:41:49.575
MATT: That's a 15. That's not bad

00:41:49.575 --> 00:41:56.278
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:41:56.278 --> 00:41:58.802
(laughter)

00:41:58.802 --> 00:41:59.642
MATT: That's awesome!

00:41:59.642 --> 00:42:01.273
TRAVIS: Pretty good one.

00:42:01.273 --> 00:42:07.722
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But anyway, thank you guys for
being like my (inaudible).

00:42:07.722 --> 00:42:08.323
MATT: Wow!

00:42:08.323 --> 00:42:16.362
TRAVIS: Wait, it won't shut up? It keeps running
through the whole show? What?

00:42:16.362 --> 00:42:19.883
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:42:19.883 --> 00:42:20.973
MATT: That's awesome!

00:42:20.973 --> 00:42:30.410
MARISHA: Are we speaking to you in our dream?
Because I'm sorry if that's the case.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:38.951
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But anyway, if you guys could
play a different animal: what animal would you be?

00:42:38.951 --> 00:42:42.399
And also what would be your favorite animal to
voice?

00:42:42.399 --> 00:42:44.652
MARISHA: To what?

00:42:44.652 --> 00:42:45.889
AUDIENCE MEMBER: To voice-over.

00:42:45.889 --> 00:42:47.026
LAURA: To voice-over?

00:42:47.026 --> 00:42:53.450
MATT: Okay, so what animal would your character
be, and what character do you want to voice-over.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.443
Like an animal.

00:42:54.443 --> 00:42:55.898
TRAVIS: I'd be a dire wolf.

00:42:55.898 --> 00:42:57.833
LAURA: Yeah!

00:42:57.833 --> 00:43:04.055
MARISHA: Totally. I mean, it's tough because
Keyleth goes to Minxie all the time. That's her

00:43:04.055 --> 00:43:15.043
favorite. That's her comfy spot. Minxie! But if
not, she'd be-- I don't know. She grew up playing

00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:24.702
as kittens and squirrels in the forest. True
story. Which is why she was weird. So I don't know.

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:31.481
LAURA: I think Vex and Vax would make really good
raccoons.

00:43:31.481 --> 00:43:35.204
MATT: Yeah, actually.

00:43:35.204 --> 00:43:37.237
TRAVIS: Trash pandas.

00:43:37.237 --> 00:43:40.305
LAURA: Trash bin? I don't want to be a trash bin!

00:43:40.305 --> 00:43:41.445
TRAVIS: Trash <i>panda</i>.

00:43:41.445 --> 00:43:42.652
LAURA: Oh, trash panda.

00:43:42.652 --> 00:43:45.520
(laughter)

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.592
MARISHA: Somehow better.

00:43:47.592 --> 00:43:51.882
LAURA: We'll all be connected though the red
panda, so it's okay.

00:43:52.270 --> 00:44:07.551
MATT: As far as me as a dungeon master? I would be
an eagle. But, you know, me as a person would

00:44:07.551 --> 00:44:17.901
probably go mongoose or owl. But not creepy barn
owls with little beady eyes and the big round

00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:24.500
face. We're talking great horned with an angry
eyebrow. That's the barn owl.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.746
LAURA: Oh, I like that one!

00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:27.690
MATT: I like that one too, but they're like--

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:28.471
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

00:44:28.471 --> 00:44:35.766
(laughter)

00:44:35.766 --> 00:44:36.962
MATT: Good question!

00:44:36.962 --> 00:44:45.271
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! I've got a question. Thank
you very much for bringing me back into D&D after

00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:52.579
a seven-year hiatus. I'm a local coordinator for
D&D Adventurers League now, including all new

00:44:52.579 --> 00:44:58.408
games, DMing 32 hours over the course of the con,
and I have to leave in 15 minutes. Will you please

00:44:58.408 --> 00:45:02.020
accept this gift on behalf of everything you've
done for it?

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.050
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.340
(laughter)

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.822
LAURA: Is it for all of us, or just Matt?

00:45:06.822 --> 00:45:11.079
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It is for some of you, and I'm
not trying to play favorites.

00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:15.958
LAURA: There's not one for me in there. There goes
the whole box.

00:45:15.958 --> 00:45:20.960
AUDIENCE MEMBER: There's one in there for you,
Laura. There are two for Keyleth. There is one for

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.797
Sam, and there is one for Travis.

00:45:23.797 --> 00:45:28.400
TRAVIS: That's Sam's. Oh shit, that looks like
me!

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.602
(laughter)

00:45:32.602 --> 00:45:33.616
LAURA: Did you paint them yourself?

00:45:33.616 --> 00:45:34.800
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I painted those myself, yes.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.380
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Thank you so much.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:43.403
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're welcome, Laura. The bigger
they are, the easier they are to hit. That was my

00:45:43.403 --> 00:45:46.009
shirt. Cosmic D&D. I love you guys.

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:47.271
LAURA: Thank you so much!

00:45:47.271 --> 00:45:54.550
(applause)

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.691
MATT: Thank you for continuing to bring the
stories that you create for other people. That's

00:45:57.691 --> 00:45:58.869
fantastic, seriously.

00:45:58.869 --> 00:46:00.261
LAURA: This is a really good Vex.

00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:05.169
TRAVIS: We've got ten minutes. We've got to do
this fast.

00:46:05.169 --> 00:46:11.231
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'll try to make this quick,
then. I've been playing tabletop games for several

00:46:11.231 --> 00:46:15.463
years, and because of Critical Role and
Titansgrave, I've been inspired to set up my first

00:46:15.463 --> 00:46:21.121
campaign this month. I'm a very shy and
introverted person, so do you have any tips for

00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:23.730
building confidence, getting the nerve to get it
started?

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.451
LAURA: Shot of tequila.

00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:30.168
(laughter)

00:46:30.168 --> 00:46:31.951
TRAVIS: We'd be drinking for that first game we
played.

00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:36.641
MARISHA: You mean for shy, introverted players?

00:46:36.641 --> 00:46:37.760
AUDIENCE: For the DM.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.121
LAURA: For yourself?

00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:42.179
MARISHA: Shot of tequila.

00:46:42.179 --> 00:46:46.766
MATT: Something to take the edge off definitely
doesn't hurt.

00:46:46.766 --> 00:46:48.511
TRAVIS: Kill all your players!

00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:52.991
(laughter)

00:46:52.991 --> 00:46:54.441
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If they're all dead, you can't be
embarrassed.

00:46:54.441 --> 00:46:58.549
MATT: It's always going to be nerve-wracking that
first game. To an extent, it's still

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:02.940
nerve-wracking today. Still get those little
butterflies in your stomach; you just learn

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:08.633
through experience to harness that going forward.
What helps is to know that all the players are

00:47:08.633 --> 00:47:12.342
there to support you, especially if you create the
right group of people that are in the right

00:47:12.342 --> 00:47:20.691
mindset. They're all excited for the prospect of
living in the space that you create for them. Be

00:47:20.691 --> 00:47:25.544
confident in the knowledge that they want to have
the same good time that you want them to have, as well.

00:47:25.544 --> 00:47:31.577
Music helps. Soundtracks are great, not just for
mood and setting, but it also makes you feel like

00:47:31.577 --> 00:47:36.241
the silence isn't being driven by you. If it's
just you talking and then nothing? That, for some

00:47:36.241 --> 00:47:40.500
reason, is more intimidating for me as a
storyteller. Having some soundtracks or music in

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:50.280
the background already helps bolster your mood as
you start weaving that little tale. And listen.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.057
Listen as a dungeon master. Because even though
the pressure is on you, in theory, to run the

00:47:54.448 --> 00:47:58.250
game, a lot of your job is reactionary and
listening to what the players do and say and act

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:04.689
as, and bringing the recourse of the world
reacting to that experience. When I say it's

00:48:04.689 --> 00:48:07.727
collaborative storytelling, it really is
collaborative. Yeah, you're the dungeon master,

00:48:07.727 --> 00:48:11.876
but all of you are creating together, so as long
as you go in the mindset that they're putting as

00:48:11.876 --> 00:48:16.360
much into this as you are-- though you may have
most of the preparation-- and you listen to what

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.729
they're doing, you'll find yourself a little more
confident in that knowledge as you go forward.

00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:24.372
I hope some of that helps. There are many things
you can try; I'm sure there are other communities

00:48:24.372 --> 00:48:28.152
out there that can give even more elaborate
responses, but off the top of my head, those are

00:48:28.152 --> 00:48:28.778
some things.

00:48:28.778 --> 00:48:29.590
TRAVIS: Good question.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.457
MATT: No worries. Good luck!

00:48:31.457 --> 00:48:36.031
(applause)

00:48:36.031 --> 00:48:36.808
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, I'm Chris.

00:48:36.808 --> 00:48:38.036
LAURA: Hey, what's up?

00:48:38.036 --> 00:48:44.756
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So when they talked about the
wrestler theme song, I merely thought of Vax's as,

00:48:44.756 --> 00:48:46.166
(singing) "Hello, darkness, my old friend..."

00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:48.441
(laughter)

00:48:48.441 --> 00:48:52.919
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is, what is the most
satisfying moment each of your characters have had

00:48:52.919 --> 00:48:53.392
in-game?

00:48:53.392 --> 00:48:55.782
LAURA: Most satisfying.

00:48:55.782 --> 00:48:57.631
MATT: Most satisfying moment for each of your
characters.

00:48:57.631 --> 00:49:03.474
MARISHA: Kicking a beholder in the face was pretty
awesome, as an earth elemental. Also, rocketing

00:49:03.474 --> 00:49:11.639
from the sky as an earth elemental meteor was
pretty awesome. Also cannonballing as an earth elemental--

00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:14.228
(laughter)

00:49:14.228 --> 00:49:16.040
MARISHA: Mainly, when I'm an earth elemental, it's
dope.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.317
(laughter)

00:49:22.777 --> 00:49:29.771
TRAVIS: I loved not dying at Kevdak's hand and
getting scooped up into the necklace-- not

00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:35.706
Pokeball-- and getting air-dropped out. I had like
four hit points. I was like, "Fuck it, I'm going

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:43.098
"to die. Let's go out in a blaze of glory." And a
natural 20 happened! It was skin of my ass.

00:49:43.098 --> 00:49:46.668
MATT: I still can't believe that.

00:49:46.668 --> 00:49:47.168
TRAVIS: I know!

00:49:47.168 --> 00:49:50.769
MATT: I was watching that battle unfold, going,
"Oh..."

00:49:50.769 --> 00:49:53.987
TRAVIS: I watched it afterwards, and I almost tore
my shirt open.

00:49:53.987 --> 00:49:58.606
(laughter)

00:49:58.606 --> 00:50:03.892
MARISHA: How many pencils have you broken now?
Three? Yeah.

00:50:03.892 --> 00:50:04.479
MATT: Laura?

00:50:04.479 --> 00:50:07.924
LAURA: I don't know. I don't know.

00:50:07.924 --> 00:50:10.331
TRAVIS: It's just a satisfying moment. It's not a
test.

00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:24.312
LAURA: I mean, scooping you up in the necklace was
pretty cool. Like flying out and doing that.

00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:25.501
TRAVIS: That was pretty dope.

00:50:25.501 --> 00:50:27.101
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Becoming royalty!

00:50:27.101 --> 00:50:30.359
LAURA: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

00:50:30.359 --> 00:50:33.033
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Talking to Trinket!

00:50:33.033 --> 00:50:37.790
LAURA: And I guess you guys are all caught up on
the show, right? I can say that out loud?

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.040
(laughter)

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.049
LAURA: To be fair, that was pretty awesome. That
wasn't my doing, though, but it was still pretty sexy.

00:50:44.049 --> 00:50:52.099
MATT: I don't want to spoil too much just in case
people are behind, but there is a location in the

00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:57.291
world that I spent a lot of time fleshing out and
designing with a lot of characters and structure,

00:50:57.291 --> 00:51:06.269
and then in one fell swoop just tearing it down.
Very weirdly cathartic. It's like spending hours

00:51:06.269 --> 00:51:13.739
building a sand castle, then just jumping on it.
It's weirdly human. I made this! Hah!

00:51:13.739 --> 00:51:17.059
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Like playing Jenga!

00:51:17.059 --> 00:51:23.549
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is actually about
LARPing, Have you guys ever done it, would you

00:51:23.549 --> 00:51:29.191
ever want to do it? For the new intro, you dressed
up as all your characters and had a lot of fun

00:51:29.191 --> 00:51:29.851
doing that.

00:51:29.851 --> 00:51:31.772
TRAVIS: It was cold as shit.

00:51:31.772 --> 00:51:41.274
MATT: I've LARPed a little bit in Vampire the
Masquerade. I didn't come in with a great

00:51:41.542 --> 00:51:46.063
experience unfortunately, because I came into a
very well-run, long-running group of like 40

00:51:46.063 --> 00:51:51.049
people in Simi Valley and LA. I got thrown into
the middle of a direct political struggle as a

00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:55.940
very important political figure with no idea about
how any of the political structure works. Everyone

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:59.562
turned to me and was like, "You are the prince's
new friend, tell me how the--" and I was like, "I

00:51:59.562 --> 00:52:07.415
don't know what's going on! Sure, that guy." It
was a little stressful. As far as fantasy LARPing,

00:52:07.415 --> 00:52:11.301
I haven't done it yet. I know one of these days I
will. I'm scared to do it because I know I'll

00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:15.447
enjoy it far too much and I have so little free
time as it is. It's going to be one of those

00:52:15.447 --> 00:52:22.182
things where I'm like, "What else can I give up to
make this happen? Sure, I don't need to eat!" But

00:52:22.182 --> 00:52:25.568
I will probably get too into it if I did.

00:52:25.568 --> 00:52:27.501
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Come do Madness with Cthulhu!

00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:37.312
MARISHA: I was going to say the three of us have
kind of casually LARPed for the Call of Cthulhu

00:52:37.312 --> 00:52:38.251
party that Matt had.

00:52:38.251 --> 00:52:39.651
LAURA: That's true, we did!

00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:41.041
MATT: That's true, yeah. I tricked you guys into
LARPing.

00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:41.592
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:52:41.592 --> 00:52:45.471
(laughter)

00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:47.510
LAURA: That was my first experience with anything
like that.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:49.265
TRAVIS: It was awesome!

00:52:49.265 --> 00:52:52.696
MATT: I ran a 1920s-style Cthulhu-based birthday
party and wrote everyone character stories, and

00:52:52.696 --> 00:52:56.750
they all came in costume and, once everyone
arrived, in-character spent the next four hours

00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:01.982
solving puzzles and wandering the house,
discovering ways to get the story--

00:53:01.982 --> 00:53:05.340
LAURA: And it all went to shit because everybody
started hoarding all the secrets for themselves.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:11.624
MATT: Yeah. It turned into a Mexican standoff.
Yuri pulled out his Tommy Gun prop that he brought

00:53:11.624 --> 00:53:12.401
in a--

00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:15.430
MARISHA: That was what was crazy. We were like--
everyone was pulling out their weapons.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.478
LAURA: He was a gangster, wasn't he?

00:53:16.478 --> 00:53:21.801
MATT: Yeah. He was a secret enforcer who showed up
with a giant violin case and was like, "I'm the musician."

00:53:21.801 --> 00:53:23.752
(laughter)

00:53:23.752 --> 00:53:26.448
MATT: Then he pulled out a Tommy Gun and it was
between him and Leo, they all started pulling guns

00:53:26.448 --> 00:53:28.122
on each other and it was a giant standoff.

00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:32.271
MARISHA: We were like, where did these come from?
We did not bring these or provide these. It was a

00:53:32.271 --> 00:53:38.550
perfect allegory, like it could have been a social
experiment for how the world's going to end. I

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.141
swear to God it went very poorly, very fast.

00:53:41.141 --> 00:53:43.164
MATT: The answer is devoured by the argument.

00:53:43.164 --> 00:53:43.636
MARISHA: Yes.

00:53:43.636 --> 00:53:45.352
LAURA: The questions are the main thing.

00:53:45.352 --> 00:53:47.498
MATT: You guys did awesome. Good question!

00:53:47.498 --> 00:53:53.777
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. First, for Travis, go
Cowboys!

00:53:53.777 --> 00:53:55.162
TRAVIS: Yeah! Cowboys!

00:53:55.162 --> 00:54:01.641
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And I've got a question for most
of you, or all of you, but it's mostly towards

00:54:01.641 --> 00:54:06.971
Matt. But first I have to ask, do you guys like
Disney movies, animated movies and Pixar movies?

00:54:06.971 --> 00:54:09.682
ALL: Yes.

00:54:09.682 --> 00:54:14.942
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Which Disney-animated character
besides Maleficent would you pick to be the best

00:54:14.942 --> 00:54:17.523
one to fight in a D&D campaign?

00:54:17.523 --> 00:54:19.482
MARISHA: Besides Maleficent?

00:54:19.482 --> 00:54:22.890
LAURA: Ooh, Ursula!

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:31.652
MARISHA: You know, I think Cruella de Vil would be
an interesting kind of, not necessarily

00:54:31.652 --> 00:54:37.941
damage-dealing, but you have to kind of intrigue
around it. Cruella de Vil as a boss would be cool.

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.560
TRAVIS: I would fist-fight Gaston.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:47.772
(cheering)

00:54:47.772 --> 00:54:52.531
MATT: So you start with Cruella de Vil, which
leads into a confrontation with Gaston, which then

00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:57.062
goes to the ultra-villain Ursula, who you think is
the main villain, until you defeat her and the

00:54:57.062 --> 00:54:58.798
mountain explodes and Chernobog arises.

00:54:58.798 --> 00:55:07.689
(laughter)

00:55:07.689 --> 00:55:08.899
LAURA: Hello!

00:55:08.899 --> 00:55:10.394
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just want to say thank you,
guys, you're awesome.

00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:11.461
MATT: You're awesome!

00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:13.191
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I met you last night, too.

00:55:13.191 --> 00:55:14.701
MATT: I know, that's how I know you're awesome!

00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:16.813
(laughter)

00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:20.422
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a voice actor question.
About a year ago, I was playing Elder Scrolls

00:55:20.422 --> 00:55:25.643
Online, and I met a tree that sounds like Grog.
Does it happen to you guys a lot? Like, you're

00:55:25.643 --> 00:55:27.850
playing a game and you hear, "Oh, I know that
guy."

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:28.898
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) Yes.

00:55:28.898 --> 00:55:31.302
(laughter)

00:55:31.302 --> 00:55:37.040
LAURA: Yeah, pretty much. There's no game you can
play now that you're not like, oh, hey Matt, hey again.

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:49.052
MARISHA: Shut up, Troy. That's my favorite, is
being like, "Oh, shut up, Grog." And screaming.

00:55:49.052 --> 00:55:54.513
LAURA: But what is surprising, when you know
somebody, like I know Matt or something, and then

00:55:54.871 --> 00:55:59.512
I find out he was the voice and I had no idea.
That's always really fun. To know somebody so well

00:55:59.512 --> 00:56:04.305
and they can still surprise you with these voices
they have. Oh, are we out of time?

00:56:04.305 --> 00:56:05.727
MODERATOR: Yeah, this one's going to be the last
one.

00:56:05.727 --> 00:56:06.862
TRAVIS: Last one. Sorry, guys.

00:56:06.862 --> 00:56:08.720
MATT: I know, it's okay.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.069
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry!

00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:19.421
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's funny, because that has
something to do with my question. How tomorrow is,

00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:30.504
or other times you play D&D live on stage, how do
you deal with nervousness? Me, I get hiccups or

00:56:30.504 --> 00:56:34.485
burps like you guys did at the first live show.

00:56:34.485 --> 00:56:37.253
LAURA: Oh, I get burps all the time.

00:56:37.253 --> 00:56:43.123
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How do you guys deal with nerves
without the alcohol?

00:56:43.123 --> 00:56:48.601
(laughter)

00:56:48.601 --> 00:56:50.363
LAURA: How do you deal with the nerves without
alcohol?

00:56:50.363 --> 00:56:58.311
MATT: Because I don't drink at the games, because
I'm not allowed to, I'm the Dungeon Master. For me--

00:56:58.311 --> 00:57:02.809
MARISHA: Point of order: we didn't do that. You
chose that.

00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:08.944
(laughter)

00:57:08.944 --> 00:57:13.369
MATT: A lot of it stems from a theatre background,
and there's something about just being on stage

00:57:13.659 --> 00:57:19.802
that, the nerves are there. You learn to harness
that energy, in a way. They never really go away.

00:57:19.802 --> 00:57:24.159
I think you'll all agree, even getting up for--
all of us have been doing stage for years and

00:57:24.159 --> 00:57:30.071
years and years, and you at E3, going on to talk
about Gears! Like, how nervous was that?

00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:33.071
LAURA: Oh, I was so nervous! So many people!

00:57:33.071 --> 00:57:39.049
MATT: It never goes away, and so the best thing
you can do is do your best to harness that energy

00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:45.013
and turn it into excitement. There's no real trick
to it, besides for some people alcohol, I guess,

00:57:45.013 --> 00:57:47.470
but just learning--

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.129
(laughter)

00:57:49.129 --> 00:57:52.806
MATT: Learning to know you're there for a reason,
and that people are there to support you, and not

00:57:52.806 --> 00:57:55.287
tear you down. And there's something exciting
about that.

00:57:55.287 --> 00:58:00.346
LAURA: And usually, once you get through that
initial moment, you'll have the nerves-- like

00:58:00.346 --> 00:58:05.610
whenever I would do musicals, my voice would crack
in my very first song, because I was so nervous

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:11.249
that I couldn't contain it, that I would always
crack, and then after that crack was done, I knew

00:58:11.249 --> 00:58:15.110
the rest of the show was going to be the bomb,
because I've gotten it out of my system, and I was

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:19.804
fine. So you just lay into it, get it out of the
way, and then everything else will be fine after that.

00:58:19.804 --> 00:58:22.503
MARISHA: What they said.

00:58:22.503 --> 00:58:35.734
(applause)

00:58:35.734 --> 00:58:38.778
LAURA: The box office is still open for the live
show, if anybody hasn't got tickets. Those are

00:58:38.778 --> 00:58:42.694
still available, you can still come and see us
tomorrow night and--

00:58:42.694 --> 00:58:45.738
TRAVIS: What's the name of the theater called,
it's the...?

00:58:45.738 --> 00:58:48.248
MODERATOR: Murat Theater. Walking distance.

00:58:48.248 --> 00:58:49.609
TRAVIS: Walking distance.

00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:54.688
MATT: Wizards of the Coast gave us a bunch of
packages of gifts that we're going to give out to

00:58:54.688 --> 00:58:55.721
people at the live show.

00:58:55.721 --> 00:59:00.200
(cheering)

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.149
TRAVIS: Ashley will be there.

00:59:01.149 --> 00:59:02.359
LAURA: Yeah, Ashley will be there!

00:59:02.359 --> 00:59:10.239
(cheering)

00:59:10.239 --> 00:59:14.314
MATT: Yeah. And for those of you with your
questions, I do have a panel at 3:00 this

00:59:14.314 --> 00:59:19.104
afternoon, video game voiceover. You're welcome to
come and bring any left over Critical Role

00:59:19.104 --> 00:59:20.804
questions as well that I'm capable of answering.

00:59:20.804 --> 00:59:23.890
MARISHA: That poor panel.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:24.834
LAURA: I know.

00:59:24.834 --> 00:59:26.471
MATT: It's just me.

00:59:26.471 --> 00:59:34.273
MARISHA: Oh, it's just you? Never mind, then. And
yes, Matt and I are now signing at the Green Ronin booth--

00:59:34.273 --> 00:59:34.936
MATT: At 12:30.

00:59:34.936 --> 00:59:36.327
MARISHA: At 12:30 to 1:30.

00:59:36.327 --> 00:59:43.220
LAURA: We're signing at 3:00, right during Matt's
panel. Sorry. Right during Matt's panel.

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:44.629
TRAVIS: We're more important than Matt!

00:59:44.629 --> 00:59:48.105
(laughter)

00:59:48.105 --> 00:59:51.010
MATT: It's true. Thank you so much for coming,
enjoy the rest of your GenCon, we'll see you

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:52.899
around, and we love you!

00:59:52.899 --> 00:59:56.579
(cheering)

00:59:56.587 --> 01:00:28.188
