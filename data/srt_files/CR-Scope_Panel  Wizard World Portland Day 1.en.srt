1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:06,110
(cheering, applause)

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,242
MATT: This is a lot of people. Before we begin,
just want to let you guys know a large part of

3
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:15,211
this panel is a Q&amp;A. We do have a microphone right
up here in front, so if you have a question you

4
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:21,562
want to ask, line up now so we can get that chaos
started before the panel. So ♫ make your ♫

5
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:28,712
♫ way to the mic right there. Contra your way to the
mic right there. ♫ Don't actually do

6
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:35,053
that. That's a very bad idea. All right, cool. Now
that we've got that flow going, I would like to

7
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:38,393
welcome all of you guys to this afternoon's
Critical Role panel here at

8
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:40,012
Wizard World, Portland.

9
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:46,373
(cheering, applause)

10
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:51,216
MATT: My name is Matthew Mercer. I am the Dungeon
Master for Critical Role and I personally want to

11
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:55,312
thank you all for coming. This is more than I
expected and I'm--

12
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:59,690
(cheering, applause)

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:06,782
--really excited about that. I'm a voice actor. We
started playing this crazy game and a Dungeon

14
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:10,065
Master wouldn't be much without his players so let
me go head and start bringing the rest of our crew

15
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:19,146
here today onstage, beginning with the incredibly
talented, hilarious Scanlan Shorthalt, played by

16
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,499
Sam Riegel.

17
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:25,476
(cheering, applause)

18
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:29,182
SAM: Hi, guys. Good to see you.

19
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:37,122
MATT: Followed up by the wondrously tinker-worthy
human gunslinger Percival von you know the name,

20
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:38,924
played by Taliesin Jaffe.

21
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:45,809
(cheering, applause)

22
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:47,272
MATT: Say hi, Taliesin.

23
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:52,883
TALIESIN: Hello. Hi, Taliesin. Oh, good, the
microphone works. Hi! Oh, wow. My god, that's a

24
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:55,917
lot of you.

25
00:01:55,917 --> 00:02:05,138
MATT: Next up, we have the masterful,
professional, mentally possibly challenged

26
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:11,596
barbarian of strength and might, Grog
Strongjaw, played by Travis Willingham.

27
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:20,846
(cheering, applause)

28
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:26,953
TRAVIS: Thank you, Kimmy. (clears throat) Also
ale.

29
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:31,586
MATT: Let's bring in our lovely ladies of the
group as well, following up with the wondrous

30
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:37,267
Vex'ahlia, one half of the half-elf twins, the
ranger gathering Trinket the bear through the

31
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:41,035
wild, we have Laura Bailey.

32
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:45,809
(cheering, applause)

33
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:47,783
TRAVIS: Wow!

34
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:50,614
LAURA: What's up?

35
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:51,904
TRAVIS: That was a good twirl.

36
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:54,505
LAURA: How are you guys doing?

37
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:59,005
MATT: Bringing up the rest of our intrepid band of
adventurers, we have the Air Ashari half-elven

38
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,980
druid Keyleth, played by Marisha Ray.

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,525
(cheering, applause)

40
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,670
TRAVIS: What a peaceful bow.

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,276
MARISHA: The water bottle bow.

42
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:17,232
MATT: And our mystical empty chair will also join
us on the edge of the panel.

43
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:18,437
SAM: It's Gilmore.

44
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:25,336
MATT: This chair represents our two party members
who could not be here, unfortunately, but sending a

45
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:29,186
little bit of love from here to Ashley, who
plays Pike, which we have a wonderful

46
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:30,743
cosplayer in the audience.

47
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,098
TRAVIS: That's a great looking Pike.

48
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,537
(cheering, applause)

49
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:36,984
TRAVIS: This is a bunch of people, man!

50
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:43,450
MATT: Yes! And Liam O'Brien, who plays the other
half of the twins, Vax'ildan. Much love to you, Liam.

51
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,305
TRAVIS: Much love, Liam!

52
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:47,421
(cheering, applause)

53
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:49,819
LAURA: And Trinket. You forgot to introduce
Trinket.

54
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:53,886
MATT: I mentioned Trinket, but everyone was
screaming over me. But yeah, Trinket of course.

55
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:55,007
Your favorite.

56
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,237
SAM: I love Trinket.

57
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,707
(laughter)

58
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:05,638
SAM: I would love him sizzled over a nice grill
with some salt.

59
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:07,707
MATT: I should've sat you next to her. That
would've been fun.

60
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,344
TALIESIN: That would've been fun.

61
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:17,391
MATT: So, yeah, guys, we're excited that you came!
Who here doesn't know what the hell's going on

62
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,938
right now?

63
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:22,191
TRAVIS: Yes! Welcome!

64
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,480
LAURA: Join us!

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,026
(speaker feedback)

66
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:32,304
MATT: So we are ... apparently about to explode.
We're a bunch of professional voice actors working

67
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:39,960
in video games and animation who also happen to be
huge nerds who play Dungeons and Dragons. We began

68
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,359
streaming our campaign about two years in, almost
a year ago, actually. We're coming up on our

69
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:51,608
anniversary soon. We stream on Twitch for Geek and
Sundry every Thursday at 7 PM Pacific Time. We

70
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:55,656
weren't sure if this was going to go anywhere and
anybody would like to watch it, and well, I think

71
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:58,128
we were very wrong.

72
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:01,227
TALIESIN: Apparently. It's pretty amazing.

73
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:07,568
MATT: Which is great. We're happy to be here and
why not kick this off with some of you guys' fan

74
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:11,628
questions and see the stories roll out from there?
So don't be afraid to jump in if you have any

75
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:15,105
random thoughts or ideas. You, sir, the front.

76
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,127
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, sir.

77
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:20,125
LAURA: Warn us if you're not up to date.

78
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,576
TRAVIS: You should say if you're current or not.

79
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:25,607
MATT: We're trying to keep spoilers out of this
discussion if possible.

80
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,458
LAURA: Which is going to be hard.

81
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,795
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm one episode back. I didn't
get a chance to see Thursday but I'm expecting to

82
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,079
watch it on Monday.

83
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,858
TRAVIS: Everybody from here over is dead.

84
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,003
(laughter)

85
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,146
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't worry.

86
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:42,231
MATT: Which is really weird for me. You kill the
DM, your game gets a little strange.

87
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:46,175
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So that actually kind of brings
up my question. About two or three episodes ago,

88
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:53,562
Liam said, "Oh, well I guess next week we're
playing Shadowrun." Are we one TPK away from a

89
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:57,056
different game? Or are we rolling up new
characters and going up next week?

90
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,749
LAURA: That's a good question!

91
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:02,826
(laughter)

92
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:10,409
MATT: You know, this world of Exandria that I've
kind of created and they've kind of helped build

93
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:16,277
that with their character moments and backstories
and such. If any characters were to die, they

94
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:20,913
would roll up a new character and we'd incorporate
them into the story to then join Vox Machina going

95
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:29,667
forward. If it was a TPK, if I survive the
internet's backlash, we would pick up where the

96
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:33,028
story left off probably with another band of
adventurers to continue the plot from a different

97
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,727
angle in some way.

98
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:45,166
SAM: What if everyone dies except Scanlan?
Could I have my own show that's just me

99
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,886
and you and a triceratops?

100
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:51,400
(laughter, cheering)

101
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,837
SAM: Like a buddy comedy.

102
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:57,226
MATT: I think you have your answer. Sorry, guys.
Sorry.

103
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:59,988
LAURA: It's all right. I understand.

104
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:01,786
MATT: Great question.

105
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:07,992
MARISHA: Lean all the way up to the mic.

106
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,288
MATT: The mic is your friend.

107
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:15,493
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, yes, indeed. What were you
guys' inspirations for the characters? I can tell

108
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:21,026
a little bit with Grog it's kind of a Conan the
Barbarian kind of deal? What were your inspirations?

109
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,066
TRAVIS: I'm an idiot, so Grog's an idiot.

110
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:26,397
(laughter)

111
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:29,469
TRAVIS: The first game that we had was at Liam
O'Brien's birthday party and Matt had given us

112
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:35,151
classes, races, all that stuff, and I was like,
uh, I don't want to be an orc. I'll be a goliath!

113
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:39,470
Goliaths are big. I'm big, that'll be fun and I'll
be a barbarian because I suck at math and spells

114
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,451
seem complicated and whatever. I didn't even come
up with a name and he sat down and he goes,

115
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:50,727
"What's your character's name?" and I was like...
Grog? There was a lot of thought that went into

116
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,469
some of these characters.

117
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:55,732
TALIESIN: You were very excited about your boots.
I do remember that. The boots were very intense.

118
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:56,670
He made boots.

119
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,779
TRAVIS: I made fine leather boots.

120
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,915
LAURA: He was so proud of that fact. And it has
not come into play at all.

121
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:04,052
MARISHA: It has not come into play since he
established that.

122
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:06,870
TRAVIS: Nope. He makes shitty leather boots.
That's probably the better way to say that.

123
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,270
LAURA: But he thinks they're fine.

124
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:14,016
MARISHA: I imagine Grog has an Etsy store in his
spare time, making boots.

125
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:16,409
TRAVIS: Bootmaiden. That's my Etsy name.

126
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,080
LAURA: I like it.

127
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,155
TRAVIS: Inspiration for your characters? Other
inspirations.

128
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:29,078
TALIESIN: Mine was based off of a short story that
I had written and never done anything with. Percy

129
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,687
takes a lot of cues from the movie Plunkett and
MacLeane. That movie is ridiculous and I'm so

130
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:44,404
proud that it exists. That and a short story about
what the poor jerk who invented the first gun

131
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:50,495
would've been like and what awful circumstances
would've led to that. It's changed quite a bit

132
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,353
from there but that's kind of where I came from.

133
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:54,553
LAURA: That's where it started?

134
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:56,752
TALIESIN: It was exciting. It was a class I'd
never played before. It was Pathfinder.

135
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:58,107
I was curious.

136
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,170
LAURA: That very first game, though, you were
something else.

137
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,565
TALIESIN: I was a dragonborn paladin.

138
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:09,793
LAURA: Our very first game that we played, nobody
really knew how to play except for Matt and

139
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,662
Taliesin and Liam had played some.

140
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:14,934
TALIESIN: In high school.

141
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:18,860
LAURA: But we all were floundering. We had no
idea. So they brought Taliesin as the ringer so if

142
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,150
we got into trouble he could be like, "I got you
covered."

143
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,528
TALIESIN: There were several times things just got
worse and worse and worse and I was finally like,

144
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:28,260
okay, coming in, fixing it. All right, let's move
on.

145
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,598
TRAVIS: He literally came in like Doogie Howser
and just brilliantly solved a puzzle that we were

146
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,433
all nearly about to die from.

147
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,723
LAURA: We're going to die!

148
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:38,005
TRAVIS: The look on Matt's face was like this is
first grade and you're all dead already.

149
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:40,393
(laughter)

150
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:45,563
TALIESIN: I'm so glad I don't have to do that
dragonborn accent anymore. That was so awful.

151
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,363
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do it!

152
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:50,822
TALIESIN: He was just sort of heavy and dry and
everything, he was, ugh, god awful.

153
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:51,826
TRAVIS: Woohoo!

154
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,327
TALIESIN: Why?

155
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,640
TRAVIS: It's kind of sexy.

156
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,953
(laughter)

157
00:09:57,953 --> 00:10:05,906
SAM: My character came about because I didn't know
anything about Dungeons &amp; Dragons and I asked Liam

158
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:13,894
what's the dumbest character and he said,
"Probably a bard." I was like, "What's the weakest

159
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:22,294
character?" He said, "I don't know, like, a
gnome." I went to Dungeons &amp; Dragons name

160
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:25,384
generator and that's how I found the name.

161
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,624
LAURA: No way!

162
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:28,895
MARISHA: I didn't know that.

163
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,725
SAM: I totally half-assed it.

164
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:35,597
(laughter, applause)

165
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:41,815
SAM: Yeah. Totally just like "Yeah, sure,
whatever." We were going to do it one time! It

166
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,078
wasn't important!

167
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:45,323
TRAVIS: Were you hoping to die in one session so
you could come back as something--

168
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:49,635
SAM: Well, we were all going to just play once for
his birthday and that was it. So I was like, eh,

169
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:54,045
I'll just be a dumb character. And then it turns
out I'm the best one!

170
00:10:54,045 --> 00:11:01,994
(cheering, laughter)

171
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:08,229
SAM: I'm super powerful and awesome! I can do
anything! It's amazing! Who knew? And I I get to

172
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:11,540
sing. I love it. What'd you say?

173
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,218
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Including crapping on a bed.

174
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:18,166
SAM: That's right. I can crap on beds. That's an
extra class feature.

175
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:26,556
MARISHA: I had tried the druid in 4th edition and
I hated it and I thought druids were useless. And

176
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:32,194
then we did this game and I was like all right,
yeah, I guess I'll give druids a shot one more

177
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:39,814
time. This was Pathfinder and you could pick a
domain kind of like clerics could, and I couldn't

178
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:47,217
decide between any of the elements, so I was like,
well, I'll just start with air and I'll just make

179
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:56,146
it my thing to go get all of them. And that's how
she was born, not really out of character

180
00:11:56,146 --> 00:12:00,428
development, mainly out of selfish min/maxer
shit.

181
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:05,898
(laughter)

182
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:08,775
MARISHA: I'm a huge Avatar: The Last Airbender
fan.

183
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,539
(cheering)

184
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:18,868
MARISHA: I didn't mean to make her based off of
The Last Airbender. It subconsciously seeped in

185
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,407
and happened that way.

186
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,339
LAURA: Nice.

187
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,369
MARISHA: Yeah. That's it, really.

188
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:32,808
LAURA: I wanted to be a rogue, but Liam had
already taken rogue. And I wanted to be a

189
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:38,837
half-elf, but Liam had already taken half-elf.
Then I realized that Liam and I actually in real

190
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:44,872
life share a birthday and so I'm like, "What if we
were actually twins in the game?" He loved it and

191
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:49,937
we went with it. I was debating between a ranger
and a druid. Actually, I didn't even know for sure

192
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:55,708
which one I wanted. I just emailed Matt and I was
like, I want a pet. What class can I have a pet

193
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:01,396
with? And he said either a druid or a ranger, so I
went with ranger so I could have Trinket.

194
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:03,855
(cheering)

195
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,619
LAURA: Who's wonderful.

196
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:06,486
MARISHA: Yes.

197
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,765
SAM: He's the best.

198
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:13,467
LAURA: I just started multiclassing into rogue,
though, because I figure it's been long enough, I

199
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:18,439
can start learning the stealthy moves from my
brother.

200
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:26,266
TRAVIS: That was a great question. Who wears a
2XL? Here, have a jetpack fighter shirt. I'm

201
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:29,217
giving out stuff when awesome questions are
asked.

202
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,236
MARISHA: I don't even know where you pulled that
from.

203
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:35,625
TALIESIN: You don't want to know. We're throwing
stuff at everyone.

204
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,926
TRAVIS: Goliath's got huge cavities.

205
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:49,713
AUDIENCE MEMBER: They said one question. Matt,
what comes first? The voice or the NPC?

206
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:57,438
MATT: For me, it's the NPC. For me, the character
inspiration for the NPC comes from where they fit

207
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:03,422
in the story, where they fit in the civilization,
what their drives are. Then I start thinking about

208
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:10,214
their history. Then I decide, depending on from
that point, what their racial traits and lifestyle

209
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:17,573
would lend them to have a specific type of
cadence, texture, vocal pitch. The voice is the

210
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:22,136
last thing that actually goes to it. But I make
sure to note next to every NPC what the voice type

211
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:26,688
and dialect is because inevitably they're going to
be pulled out of nowhere. It's fine if it's a home

212
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:31,857
game and a character's voice changes from session
to session, but when you have CritRoleStats

213
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:36,041
scanning every episode--

214
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,476
TRAVIS: He's got his notepad right now!

215
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:40,546
SAM: He's taking notes.

216
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,277
MATT: "How many character NPC inconsistencies has
Mercer done since episode one? Let's look at the

217
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:46,579
time code."

218
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:49,046
TRAVIS: He's our court stenographer.

219
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:52,986
MATT: Right, I know. That's also forced me to kind
of step up my game a little bit, too. You guys

220
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:58,017
have helped me with that. So I go character first,
voice second, and then make notes to remind myself

221
00:14:58,017 --> 00:14:59,304
where that lies.

222
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:01,692
SAM: Then do you choose how many fingers they
have?

223
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,110
(laughter)

224
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,993
MATT: That's only come up recently. That's called
character progression.

225
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,099
(laughter)

226
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:09,399
TRAVIS: Oh, that's so good.

227
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,938
SAM: Soon it will be less than three.

228
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:14,746
MATT: Well played.

229
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:18,085
TALIESIN: That character came out of nowhere, too.
Like that was, apparently, I just found out that--

230
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:23,616
MATT: Yeah, Victor wasn't planned. Victor was an
NPC that was pulled out of the ether when we were

231
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,083
in Vasselheim the first time, and Percy's like,
"I'm going to go buy some black powder. Where can

232
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,455
I find that?" And I'm like--

233
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:30,826
SAM: Better think quick!

234
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:33,857
MATT: Well, let's find out. (nervous strangled
sound) Like, even when he asked, "What's your

235
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:40,257
name?" and I just went "Victor!" He was like,
"What was that?" and I went, in my head, "I don't

236
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:42,165
know. What did I just say?"

237
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:43,203
(laughter)

238
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:47,803
MATT: "It sounded kind of like Victor. Victor it
is!" It came out of nowhere, so sometimes NPCs get

239
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:50,642
created simultaneously.

240
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:53,822
LAURA: Had you created Gilmore before we ran into
Gilmore?

241
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:57,928
MATT: Yes, I had designed Gilmore's Glorious Goods
as part of the Abdar's Promenade in Emon

242
00:15:57,928 --> 00:16:02,125
intentionally, as one of the characters you might
encounter as you went through the city, so I was

243
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:06,244
very glad that he got to have his moment to shine,
and continue to shine. I wasn't expecting him to

244
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,313
become so central to parts of the story.

245
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:09,203
SAM: Shines so brightly.

246
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,416
LAURA: We just love him so much.

247
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,515
TRAVIS: There is no life without Gilmore.

248
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:17,477
MATT: "He's a majestic one." I only recently
realized, looking back at the episodes, that his

249
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:22,875
hand is like this. He just has a hand, at all
times, he's presentary, and then when he's,

250
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:27,448
"Mm-hmm, of course." It's almost like he's holding
a fan but there's not one there? I don't know.

251
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:29,245
It's weird. Good question!

252
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:30,395
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is for you for later.

253
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,659
MATT: Oh! All right!

254
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,229
SAM: Okay, that was a good question. Someone's
getting a t-shirt.

255
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,916
TRAVIS: Just throw it a hard as you-- First row.

256
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,433
MATT: You're just hitting that front row, man.

257
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,847
TRAVIS: You made it to the first row.

258
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:44,630
SAM: My arm is spaghetti. I'm a young boy.

259
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,682
LAURA: You have little boy arms!

260
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:52,180
TRAVIS: I'm a little boy. Don't hit me!

261
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,348
MATT: Yes!

262
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:57,735
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Here's a question I'm sure the
people at CritRoleStats would like to know about.

263
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:07,222
It's directed at Taliesin. As far as the feat you
chose for Percival, we've seen two of the three

264
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:11,748
choices that you've made for him. Will we be
seeing the third choice?

265
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:12,979
TALIESIN: No, you've seen all three!

266
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:13,830
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, really?

267
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,866
SAM: What are they?

268
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:16,829
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hex?

269
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,471
TALIESIN: Hex, Minor Illusion, and Friends.

270
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,778
LAURA: Oh, that's right!

271
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,979
TALIESIN: Friends is the third one, which I have
now used a couple times.

272
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,241
SAM: (hums Friends theme)

273
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:30,336
TALIESIN: I was about to use it on you if things
started getting way too bad in the shop.

274
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:31,301
TRAVIS: Ah, shit.

275
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,019
(laughter)

276
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:38,120
TALIESIN: I was going to very gently suggest that
you just hand everything over to Vex, and enchant

277
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,822
you to do so. I was prepared to--

278
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:42,369
TRAVIS: I didn't know you could do magic!

279
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,902
TALIESIN: That's my money!

280
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:46,783
MARISHA: Instead, you pulled the amazing Minor
Illusion move.

281
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:49,184
TALIESIN: Minor Illusion worked out great.

282
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,451
TRAVIS: Missed that too!

283
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:54,060
LAURA: I have to say, this is the best thing,
because Travis legitimately did not know that

284
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,950
that's what he did.

285
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,264
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

286
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,813
LAURA: It wasn't a character choice. He just
didn't know.

287
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,764
TRAVIS: People were like, oh, Travis with the
amazing RP, playing a character. I didn't fucking

288
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:04,932
notice, you guys.

289
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:07,027
(laughter)

290
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:09,665
TALIESIN: After the game, he's like, "So what
would have happened if I'd put my hand in the

291
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:13,976
shadow?" I'm like, "Well, you would have grabbed
the skull then, wouldn't you?" And he's like,

292
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:17,735
"No!" You were so angry.

293
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:20,750
TRAVIS: Matt was gonna give it to me, too!
And I’m like, I don't reach in there! You with

294
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,470
your stupid shop water!

295
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,269
TALIESIN: I was trying to give you the eye when
that was happening, like don't do it! Don't do it!

296
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:29,284
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's super dumb.

297
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:32,071
TRAVIS: You're all a bunch of dicks.

298
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:33,806
MATT: Good on you.

299
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:38,755
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is as both you as people,
and as characters. It's hard because Liam's not

300
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:43,072
here, but do you guys think that Vaxleth is a
healthy relationship?

301
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,742
(laughter)

302
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,575
SAM: Is a healthy relationship?

303
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:50,451
LAURA: No! Not at all!

304
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,685
TALIESIN: No.

305
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:55,116
SAM: No, not at all.

306
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:58,353
TALIESIN: They're like the two friends in high
school who are dating, and like, this is gonna be

307
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:00,015
such an explosion.

308
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,565
(laughter)

309
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:03,857
LAURA: It's gonna be so bad.

310
00:19:03,857 --> 00:19:06,623
MARISHA: This is the first time I'm hearing any of
this, by the way!

311
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,909
(laughter)

312
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:14,907
MARISHA: So no, tell me! How bad is it, guys? Tell
me. Let's get it all out right now.

313
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:17,056
TALIESIN: It's amazing.

314
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:21,067
LAURA: I just love-- no, wait, not everybody's
caught up.

315
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,885
TALIESIN: Do it.

316
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:27,125
MARISHA: Spoiler alert! If you're not caught up,
go la la la la la.

317
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:34,725
LAURA: Kashaw showing up in the last episode made
me so happy as a person.

318
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:37,115
TRAVIS: So happy.

319
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:45,770
LAURA: So good! And so angry, as Vex. It was
wonderful.

320
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,276
TRAVIS: It's pretty great.

321
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,370
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I'm starting to get used to
it.

322
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,264
MATT: Aww!

323
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,955
LAURA: I'm kind of going for it now, as Vex,
though.

324
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,395
MARISHA: Yeah.

325
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,908
LAURA: I'm kind of going for it.

326
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:59,269
MARISHA: I mean, we could talk about you and
Jarett.

327
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:04,785
(oohing)

328
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:08,236
SAM: He's so hot.

329
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:13,265
MARISHA: I actually did not expect that type of
reaction.

330
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:14,288
TRAVIS: It's the crossbow.

331
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:17,455
LAURA: He's pretty wonderful. He's pretty
wonderful.

332
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,188
MARISHA: It's a good question, dude.

333
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:24,435
TALIESIN: All right, good. Okay, XL, big XL. I'm
going over here.

334
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:29,025
MARISHA: I love our system. You have a good
question. Let's give attention to someone else. Is

335
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,475
that my-- too much?

336
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:34,837
SAM: It's just pointing over there. Let's move it
up.

337
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,089
MATT: Technology.

338
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:41,178
LAURA: Oh, right because it's all over to the
side. It's sliding.

339
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:46,758
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, I've been a DM for a little
bit, and I--

340
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:48,218
SAM: Quick, DM off!

341
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:49,617
(laughter)

342
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:53,406
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mainly a question for Matt, but
everyone else can help answer it.

343
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:55,058
TRAVIS: Okay, we'll help you.

344
00:20:55,058 --> 00:21:00,355
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, thank you. I've been having
troubles with my players actually trying to

345
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:08,528
roleplay in the games, I mean. I try setting up
the scenarios so it's easy for them to do it, but

346
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:16,592
one of them, his most creative side is to kill a
monster by poking it in the butt.

347
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:18,977
LAURA: (laughing) That's amazing!

348
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,349
MARISHA: That's a method, yeah!

349
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:23,763
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, but every time it's not! But
I--

350
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:27,368
MATT: And then what happens if he comes back into
town and someone's like: "Oh, look, it's Gerald,

351
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:28,958
the Butt Poker!"

352
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,328
(laughter)

353
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:33,097
MATT: "All hail the Butt Poker!" And he becomes
known as the Butt Poker everywhere. Then you can

354
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:35,599
work it in.

355
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,864
AUDIENCE MEMBER: There's another one that, instead
of trying to escape a dangerous encounter that I

356
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:44,511
put him in, instead started to roll for a new
character while we were playing the game.

357
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,259
(laughter)

358
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,429
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, how do I make them--

359
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:52,600
MARISHA: It sounds like your players have more
issues of optimism.

360
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,409
AUDIENCE MEMBER: -- get them more open to the
game?

361
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,798
MATT: For them to already be rolling a new
character during the encounter means maybe then

362
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:03,199
want to try a different class, which is fine if
they want to do that. As far as engaging people,

363
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:10,028
to use an old adage, you can lead a horse to
water. A person has to feel comfortable enough to

364
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,398
step out of their comfort zone to try it, so you
can't force it on them. You can try and coax them

365
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:19,828
into it over time. I also find it helps if you
engage them as the NPC directly. If you tell them,

366
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:23,441
"You walk into a tavern, the barkeeper
tells you, Ah, you should buy a room! It's

367
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:27,577
different than going, "He turns to you, squeaks
the inside of his jar and goes, Aye, miss,

368
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:33,262
"what can I do for you?" You know? And just that
eye contact? It becomes a conversation as opposed

369
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:39,260
to keeping them in their imagination, controlled
facet that feels more comfortable. It might take

370
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,600
a while. You can talk to your players and be like,
"Hey guys, it'd be cool if we could try and push a

371
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,801
little more into character RP and discussions, and
don't put any pressure on them for it but help

372
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:54,769
coax them out by addressing them directly and
taking into account that what they say is what

373
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:00,369
their character says. Something like, "Oh, I'm not
going to talk to this guy." Be like, "I'm sorry,

374
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:06,874
you're not going to talk to who?!" "Oh, I
mean-- I didn't-- That was him!" So you can

375
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:11,575
can play in elements of that and get them 
comfortable with the idea of speaking as

376
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:15,519
their character. Not everyone will be, and
you can't force it.

377
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:21,370
LAURA: I'm seeing behind the screen right now and
it's kind of weird. To know that that's what

378
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,339
you're doing to us.

379
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,489
(laughter)

380
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:30,149
SAM: Puppet master.

381
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:32,571
TALIESIN: Things just work out better when we
actually RP.

382
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:36,460
MATT: Well that's the thing. RP circumstances can
also have their own rewards, too. If someone talks

383
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:42,660
their way out of a good situation, they'll get a
more profitable circumstance based on the quest or

384
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,341
mission they're on. They might uncover information
that is vital to their current plan and

385
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:51,761
disposition. They may end up unlocking an ally
that they didn't have previously. These are all

386
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:56,050
different ways you can reward good RP, as well as
just a nice little experience bump. I keep track

387
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,069
of good character moments, and I give little bonus
experience points.

388
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:00,710
TRAVIS: You do not!

389
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,220
(laughter)

390
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,318
TALIESIN: He does! Do you not read the emails you
get, like, every like-- oh, yeah.

391
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,659
TRAVIS: There's a bunch of numbers in them!

392
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,391
(laughter)

393
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:10,379
MARISHA: You realize we get different numbers,
right?

394
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:13,541
LAURA: We do? Wait! So those are-- Wait, wait!

395
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,318
MARISHA: We don't get the same.

396
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:19,530
LAURA: Do I get extra experience when I 
haggle?

397
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,923
TRAVIS: No, nobody cares about that.

398
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:22,690
(laughter)

399
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,305
LAURA: Because you never write that in the email
that I get extra experience for that!

400
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,379
MATT: That was a great question. Thank you so
much!

401
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,714
(laughter)

402
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:35,321
TRAVIS: No, damn it! Oh, the door is 
closed! He doesn't tell us crap!

403
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:36,631
LAURA: Nothing!

404
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:37,964
TRAVIS: And we try all the time.

405
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:39,033
MATT: It's fun.

406
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:40,881
LAURA: Travis texts him all the time.

407
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,128
TRAVIS: I text him when it's late, maybe he's had
a drink, maybe he's tired. "If I had actually

408
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:49,257
crushed his skull, what would have happened?" And
he's like, "You don't know." Son of a bitch.

409
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:50,696
(laughter)

410
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:54,897
MARISHA: I'm actually really excited because we
have planned, as soon as we all eventually die or

411
00:24:54,925 --> 00:25:02,986
if this campaign comes to an end, we're going to
have a party that's us at god's gate. And it's

412
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:09,213
just going to be us asking Matt, "Okay, that one
time that we did this--" And it's just going

413
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:12,363
to be us asking Matt all the questions that
we've ever wanted to ask.

414
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:14,862
TRAVIS: Maybe we should just all die now.

415
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:15,884
LAURA: TPK.

416
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:16,874
TRAVIS: Suicide pact!

417
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:19,800
SAM: You sir, what's your question?

418
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:25,611
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First, if anyone hasn't seen
Thursday's episode, you have to watch it. It's the

419
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:28,431
best in a long time.

420
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:31,910
(cheering)

421
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:39,360
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is for Matt. I've
been DMing my own campaign for close to a year

422
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:53,080
now, and my question is about roleplaying,
specifically roleplaying women. Going into it, I'm

423
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,861
aware of all these tropes and pitfalls that I can
fall into for roleplaying women. How do you

424
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:04,962
approach designing and RPing a woman?

425
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:13,160
SAM: All women talk like this. (valley girl
accent) Hi. Oh my god.

426
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:20,234
TALIESIN: You are a master class, I swear. I feel
like a better actor just sitting next to you.

427
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:23,169
MATT: I actually felt the heat from Laura's stare
on that one.

428
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:26,439
TRAVIS: You don't want those dragon eyes.

429
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:31,379
MATT: It's interesting, because it is a comfort
hurdle for a lot of players and Dungeon Masters

430
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:36,170
alike to step into the opposite sex. You know, we
have a lot of cultural weirdness in places about

431
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,668
that whole thing, and you have to kind of look
past that initially. I was a theater kid, so I

432
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:41,660
didn't have any shame.

433
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,350
(cheering)

434
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,235
MATT: Woo! But also, it's just like any other
person. They're just a person. You think of their

435
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:54,218
wants, their needs, their fears, their drives,
their goals. As a female, you consider their place

436
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:58,607
in the world. Is it like our society was fifty
years ago where women were almost a second-class

437
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:04,038
citizen, and are they fighting to make themselves,
fighting back against the patriarchy? Are they

438
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:10,119
heralded as a matriarch? Is it like Lolth spider
queen style, where the men are just used for

439
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:17,158
fodder and mating, and are slaughtered? Figure out
their power dynamic in society, and be comfortable

440
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:20,718
that it's a strong character, not necessarily that
it's a woman. That becomes a secondary and

441
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:24,340
unnecessary facet to it, in my opinion.

442
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,411
MARISHA: And that's true for storytelling in
general.

443
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,881
LAURA: Yeah.

444
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,588
(clapping)

445
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:34,037
MATT: As far as just distinguishing-- I had this
question earlier, how do you change your voice to

446
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:40,341
be female? I don't change my voice that much,
really. There's a difference between chest voice

447
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:46,739
and head voice. You know, thinking of the
definition, it goes up more into your upper palate

448
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:51,310
and your sinuses, and for a man it just takes some
of the resonation out of it to where a character

449
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:57,819
that talks normally in this way can sound a little
softer, a little more--

450
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,011
TRAVIS: Light.

451
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:05,497
MATT: Gently domineering, which I really enjoy as
a strong female NPC. Allura skirts that line quite

452
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:11,646
a bit, and I like that a lot. More than anything,
it shouldn't be part of a focus. You always get

453
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:17,959
that dumb player who gets asked by the barmaiden,
"Can I get you guys a drink?", and he's like, "Oh,

454
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:22,678
she's a woman? Well I'm going to go ahead and slap
her on the butt." He's about to get pummeled by

455
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:29,158
the guards in the tavern. Remember, even in these
societies, sexism probably is not cool, and

456
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:34,687
whoever works at that bar has a lot of friends she
works with that are watching her back. Just saying.

457
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:35,662
AUDIENCE MEMBER: All right, thank you.

458
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:36,776
MATT: No worries. Good question.

459
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:38,176
TRAVIS: Great question!

460
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,399
(clapping)

461
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:42,758
LAURA: We have no more t-shirts.

462
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:43,769
MATT: Hello!

463
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:44,967
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Theater for life, first off.

464
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:46,598
MATT: Yes.

465
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:50,418
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I apologize if I ramble, because
I do that. Thanks to Critical Role and things like

466
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:55,067
Wil Wheaton's TableTop, watching people play
tabletop games has become very popular. More

467
00:28:55,067 --> 00:29:01,256
popular than it has been previously, with tons of
Twitch shows like Critical Role, actual plays,

468
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:04,067
which are podcasts of people playing D&amp;D and
things--

469
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,521
MATT: Yeah.

470
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:10,200
AUDIENCE MEMBER: With all of that, are there any
secondary versions of Critical Role, actual plays,

471
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,651
things like that, that you guys enjoy? If so,
what? If not, would you?

472
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:17,500
SAM: To watch on our own, you mean?

473
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,171
AUDIENCE MEMBER: To watch, or listen to, or
anything like that. You can put it on your phone

474
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:21,300
as a podcast.

475
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,839
SAM: Well for myself, I can barely even make the
game that we play.

476
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,620
(laughter)

477
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:31,109
SAM: So I don't have a lot of time to veg out and
watch other people play and roll dice, although I

478
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:37,719
heard Laura was in, you both were in Titansgrave?

479
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,041
LAURA: Titansgrave, yeah.

480
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,341
SAM: I mean, that was cool.

481
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:41,267
LAURA: Thanks.

482
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,471
(laughter)

483
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:47,152
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laughing) That was cool.

484
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:54,843
LAURA: Yeah, Titansgrave was really fun. Kurtis
Wiebe, the writer and co-creator of Rat Queens--

485
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:56,589
(cheering)

486
00:29:56,589 --> 00:30:04,241
LAURA: They do D20 Babes, and we did a Star Wars
RPG with Kurtis. And it was really really fun and

487
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,764
they're great people.

488
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:08,103
TRAVIS: Yeah, I played a wookie. That was great.
(wookie noise)

489
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:09,455
(laughter)

490
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:11,288
TRAVIS: Couldn't talk. I loved it.

491
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:20,842
MARISHA: And there's always "Acquisitions Inc."
Acquisitions Inc has been around forever. They're great.

492
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:29,387
MATT: Yeah, that's really great. Also, there's-- I've enjoyed
it for a long time-- Real Role Play with itmeJP.

493
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:35,256
Those guys have done phenomenal games for a very long
time. There's also-- what was that?

494
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:36,477
LAURA: (muffled)

495
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:42,196
MATT: Oh, I confused myself. Also, recently the
Yogscast guys have done High Rollers which is DMed

496
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:46,245
by a good friend of mine, Mark Holmes out in the
UK. And they're kicking ass as well, so those are

497
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:53,117
a number of the ones that I watch and keep track
of, both for inspiration and to meet other people

498
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,006
in the community, so it's cool.

499
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:56,247
SAM: Good question.

500
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:57,088
MATT: Well done.

501
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:57,919
MARISHA: Yeah.

502
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,629
MATT: Your quest is fantastic.

503
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:01,666
MARISHA: Next question.

504
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,579
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello.

505
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,537
MARISHA: Hello.

506
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:06,681
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question that's a little more
specific than these other ones. It has to do with

507
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:14,107
the very first Critmas special, where toward the
end Marisha got an in-character letter from Pike

508
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:22,703
which included a psalm that was in Celestial, and I
was wondering if you ever got it translated?

509
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:28,407
MARISHA: To decipher the letter that I got from
Pike that was written in Celestial?

510
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:29,570
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.

511
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,816
MARISHA: You know, it's still on my to-do list.

512
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:37,810
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a translation for you.

513
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,948
MARISHA: I'm sure it's a wonderful, lovely
message.

514
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:44,070
TALIESIN: She owes me breakfast, so this doesn't
surprise me.

515
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,368
MARISHA: True.

516
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,717
LAURA: Did you write it?

517
00:31:46,717 --> 00:31:47,867
MARISHA: Was that you?

518
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:52,361
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I brought the translation with
me, so you don't have to do the work.

519
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:56,396
(applause)

520
00:31:56,396 --> 00:32:07,516
MATT: That's awesome! I was surprised, too, because
she took Celestial for three years in college.

521
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:09,976
(laughter)

522
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:12,387
MATT: She should have it.

523
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:14,127
TRAVIS: Eat more chicken.

524
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:16,426
SAM: That's a lot of cursing.

525
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:21,457
TALIESIN: Don't call it a comeback. I've been here
for years.

526
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:22,886
MARISHA: I'm going to cry if I read it.

527
00:32:22,886 --> 00:32:23,975
TRAVIS: Don't read it.

528
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,009
MARISHA: Okay, keep going.

529
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,901
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I'm the dungeon master for
our current group, and I've noticed on Critical

530
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:34,602
Role that, whenever you guys roll a one, it's
just an auto-miss, and you guys don't have a

531
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:38,992
fumble chart or anything for the ones. I was
wondering if that was something specifically for

532
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:44,631
the show, or if you as a dungeon master don't like
using them, or what was up with that, or if there

533
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:47,021
is just enough pain in the game as it is.

534
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:47,852
MATT: Right.

535
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:52,210
SAM: What is he saying, what? Translate. I don't
play Dungeons and Dragons. I don't know what he's

536
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,331
talking about.

537
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:54,899
(laughter)

538
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:59,536
MATT: In older editions, in some variations, if you
were to roll a natural one, it wasn't just an auto

539
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:01,498
miss, it was--

540
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:02,451
TRAVIS: You died.

541
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:06,753
MATT: You had to roll on a chart to see what
horrible thing happened to you for rolling so poorly.

542
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:07,886
SAM: Oh, okay.

543
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:13,877
MATT: Which is really fun. For my games, I
consider the natural one more of a narrative

544
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:20,958
failure. I like to explain the visual aspect of
why you failed so much, and in some cases it's

545
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:27,038
more of a shame than an actual-- more of
a mechanical horrible blunder.

546
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:29,970
MARISHA: It's always a shame, always shame.

547
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,934
MATT: And partially because I've played games
where people use those charts, and they're like,

548
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:37,218
"All right, you go to attack the orc. Critical
fail. You accidentally cut off your

549
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:40,971
"own head." And I'm like, "Really? How is that?
No."

550
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:42,209
SAM: How would you ever do that?

551
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:45,512
MARISHA: Yeah, what was the con we were at this
past weekend, and the guy was telling a story

552
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:54,074
about that, and he rolled to just gently kick his
friend awake, just kind of nudging his friend

553
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:58,993
awake, and so the DM made him roll for it, and he
rolled a nat one.

554
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,254
MATT: Natural 20.

555
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:01,950
MARISHA: Oh, it was a natural 20.

556
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,897
MATT: He was like, "Roll a strength check," and
I'm like, "To kick your friend awake?"

557
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,010
LAURA: He kicked his head off?

558
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,038
MARISHA: He kicked his head off!

559
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:07,969
(laughter)

560
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:12,999
MARISHA: You're 100% right. He kicked his head off
and I was like, "That's harsh. That's, like, way harsh."

561
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,602
LAURA: That's bullshit.

562
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,248
MARISHA: You just got punished for a nat 20.

563
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:19,098
LAURA: That's not okay.

564
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,581
TRAVIS: That's great.

565
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:22,157
(laughter)

566
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:26,799
MATT: So yeah, I think it's a cool system if you
want to incorporate it. I tried it for years for

567
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:31,170
certain things and it has its merits, definitely.
I felt for our game I like to make the fumbles

568
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:34,868
more of a narrative failure than an actual
mechanical failure. Because then it can get a

569
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:37,342
little too weird and really, really bite you back.

570
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,649
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I gave them the choice and they
chose the sheet

571
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:44,738
MATT: Well, fair enough, and that is entirely their
call.

572
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:45,988
TALIESIN: Heads will roll.

573
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:47,153
MATT: Let them burn.

574
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,326
SAM: Yes, sir.

575
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:52,279
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. This question is not so
much about D&amp;D as it much as it is about your

576
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:56,776
careers in general, and kind of just a fun
question entirely, but if you could steal one role

577
00:34:56,776 --> 00:35:01,179
from one of your colleagues, like for example if
Travis wanted to steal the role of Krom from Matt,

578
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:05,814
or if Marisha wanted to steal the role of Maka
from Laura, would you do it and who would you take?

579
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,251
LAURA: Stealing a role from somebody else?

580
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:10,984
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, if you wanted to voice
somebody that one of these people--

581
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,626
SAM: A voice role.

582
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:15,931
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Would you do it? Like who would
it be?

583
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:16,707
LAURA: Oh man.

584
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:18,338
MARISHA: I don't know if I've thought about it.

585
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:23,276
LAURA: I mean, Ellie-- she's not here, but Ellie
from the Last of Us

586
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:24,286
TALIESIN: I'd steal Ellie.

587
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:27,157
LAURA: That's an amazing character, but the thing
is, I can say Ellie-- Hey.

588
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:35,348
(applause)

589
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:37,992
MARISHA: Best con ever.

590
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:42,119
LAURA: I can say Ellie from the Last of Us, but she
wouldn't be that character. She wouldn't be that

591
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,929
amazing if Ashley hadn't played her.

592
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:50,403
MARISHA: Yeah, I kind of agree with Laura. It's
almost hard to say because the actors bring so

593
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:53,186
much of the characters themselves that it just
wouldn't be the same.

594
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:54,693
TRAVIS: Yeah, I agree.

595
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:59,587
MARISHA: But I guess if I had to pick one. Thor. I
want Thor!

596
00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:01,339
TRAVIS: You can have him.

597
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,750
MARISHA: Tell that to Marvel.

598
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,903
TALIESIN: I'll take Black Widow, if you take
Thor.

599
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:09,811
LAURA: Hey, I like that.

600
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:11,188
MARISHA: All right, yeah.

601
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:20,349
SAM: I mean, I have a terrible nasal voice. I
would love to have some of Travis' sack.

602
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:23,291
TRAVIS: I'll trade you my sack for your beer.

603
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,777
SAM: You've got beer.

604
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:27,200
TRAVIS: That's not enough.

605
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,496
(laughter)

606
00:36:29,496 --> 00:36:31,415
SAM: You, ma'am.

607
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:35,138
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, first of all, I am dressed as
Vex'ahlia today.

608
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:36,940
(applause)

609
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,342
SAM: Oh wow.

610
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:42,635
MARISHA: Oh shit, I just realized! It took me half
a second. Dope!

611
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:51,271
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First of all, Matt, thank you so
much, because I have wanted to Dungeon Master for

612
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:54,150
years and years and I'm finally doing it.

613
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,077
(applause)

614
00:36:57,077 --> 00:37:01,280
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm starting a Pathfinder game
next week and I'm just so thankful for all the tips

615
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,508
and tricks and stuff you put online. I am so
thankful.

616
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,820
MATT: Thank you. I hope they help and there's a
lot of great communities online too, far before I

617
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:14,499
put anything up there, that expand upon these
tips as well, so don't be afraid to reach out to

618
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:18,695
the Reddit D&amp;D page and the RPG. Check out
all those guys.

619
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:24,256
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That being said, last year I
touched Wil Wheaton and my rolls have been really shitty.

620
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:25,987
MATT: Oh no, I'm so sorry.

621
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:31,270
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So do you have any things that I
can do to cleanse the Wil Wheaton?

622
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,876
MATT: We can try but, understand, it's a very
strong curse.

623
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:40,200
TALIESIN: The sage helped. The sage helped a lot.

624
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,405
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'll just get a selfie with
Taliesin and it'll be fine, I'm sure.

625
00:37:42,405 --> 00:37:46,685
TALIESIN: I specifically had sage powdered in
dragon's blood. It was really intense.

626
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,556
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, I'll try that too.

627
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:49,697
TALIESIN: Not kidding.

628
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:51,291
MATT: Step forward, step forward.

629
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:55,470
SAM: (singing)

630
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:02,629
TALIESIN: (singing)

631
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:06,979
TRAVIS: Wow, wow.

632
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:10,594
LAURA: You're officially the Little Mermaid.
Congratulations.

633
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:14,407
MATT: She's going get real angry when it doesn't
work.

634
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:16,730
MARISHA: She's even got the Vex swagger going.

635
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:19,496
SAM: You, sir, man with the beer.

636
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:21,276
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Laura, you're getting a beer,
right?

637
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:22,914
SAM: The beer's really good.

638
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:25,267
TRAVIS: It's really hoppy and delicious.

639
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:30,088
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question's for you, Matt: how
the heck do you come up with all the names for the

640
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:34,122
places around the world? That's the problem I'm
having because I'm trying to create a game. Just

641
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:36,496
naming places is my problem.

642
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:41,137
MATT: Naming convention is interesting. I've
always liked making up weird names anyway and a

643
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:44,878
lot of times I'll just start thinking of-- it
starts with letters that haven't been used very

644
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:49,636
often in other areas, so I'll be like, all right, I
made a Stillben, so that's an S name so I don't

645
00:38:49,688 --> 00:38:55,456
want to make another S named town nearby, so I'll
go W. Westruun kinda came from just trying to

646
00:38:55,507 --> 00:39:04,662
think of, it's to the west of where the main city
will be. Expansion sent it west. And then from

647
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:10,487
that point, I started taking inspiration from
different languages that would affiliate that area.

648
00:39:10,487 --> 00:39:17,702
A lot of Norse language works near Vasselheim.
Looking into root words and certain spelling

649
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:22,181
techniques in other languages and jamming things
together that sound interesting and roll off the

650
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:23,087
tongue well.

651
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:29,248
SAM: What you do is you pick your middle name and
the street you grew up on and your pet name

652
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:31,169
and that's the name.

653
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:37,015
MATT: And there's also really good name generators
online for fantasy locations that you can go ahead.

654
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:38,506
SAM: (smug clicking)

655
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:43,978
MATT: Worked out well for some folks. But yeah,
just pull inspiration from books that you like,

656
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:49,183
campaigns that already exist, source books if you
have them, and take pieces from certain words that

657
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:52,787
you like and jam them together and see if it
sounds nice when you say it. That's all you really need.

658
00:39:52,787 --> 00:39:54,868
TRAVIS: Name all your characters Percy.

659
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:56,539
MATT: All of them.

660
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:58,556
SAM: Percival de Rolo de Momo.

661
00:39:58,556 --> 00:39:59,933
MARISHA: Frederick von--

662
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:03,210
TALIESIN: (singing) It's delightful, it's
delectable, it's de-lovely.

663
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,570
SAM: Next question, please.

664
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,050
TRAVIS: Wait, Vex wants to try.

665
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,852
LAURA: No, I've had some ale.

666
00:40:09,852 --> 00:40:20,212
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I heard that. Hi! I have some
bracelets for you guys. I don't really have a

667
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:26,222
question. I'm going to give these to you guys. I'm
representing Extra Life. We raise money for

668
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:32,817
Doernbecher's and we raise money for children who
are sick, terminally, and I just want to give you

669
00:40:32,817 --> 00:40:34,099
some bracelets.

670
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,510
MATT: That is awesome.

671
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,886
TRAVIS: Applaud this woman!

672
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:39,028
(applause)

673
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:40,019
MATT: Thank you so much.

674
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:40,847
TRAVIS: That's great.

675
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,188
TALIESIN: Yes, thank you.

676
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:43,228
TRAVIS: Thank you.

677
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:44,819
LAURA: Thank you so much.

678
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:49,039
MATT: I want to take a minute while we're talking
about this, actually. One of the really amazing

679
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,249
things to come out of this community, aside from
the perpetual beer.

680
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:56,999
TRAVIS: Seriously, best panel ever.

681
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,955
SAM: Yeah, this is the best panel ever.

682
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:04,602
TRAVIS: A bit of advice, write ale into your
backstory, bitches, because hey!

683
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:12,593
SAM: Hey, also don't write poop into your
backstory, because people send me poop all the time.

684
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:19,080
MARISHA: I love that if we wait for like ten
minutes one will just appear. They're spawning!

685
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:27,082
MATT: That's real magic. To take a minute off that
topic, one of the-- so many amazing things have

686
00:41:27,082 --> 00:41:31,874
sprung out of this community, more than we ever
could have expected or hoped. But one of the things

687
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:38,011
that perpetually humbles and blows me away is the
generosity of all of you guys supporting all these

688
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:42,874
wonderful charities, all these wonderful causes.
You guys communally have raised so much money and

689
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:48,692
so much awareness to so many amazing, largely
overlooked in a lot of cases, charitable intents

690
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:52,853
and it's incredible. So give yourselves a huge
round of applause.

691
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:55,812
TRAVIS: Yeah, seriously, you guys are amazing.

692
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:57,294
(applause)

693
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:59,393
MARISHA: We are literally changing the world with
D&amp;D.

694
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:05,332
LAURA: It's crazy. It's so amazing that you guys
have done so much. And that Critmas is

695
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:11,042
the most amazing thing and the gifts that you guys
send are so wonderful, but the fact that you guys

696
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:18,371
are donating to other people and doing good in the
name of this community is so freaking amazing.

697
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:25,482
MARISHA: Ultimately, the whole reason we even did
this show was to share it out with other people

698
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:33,903
and to share the joy that is D&amp;D and gaming. It's
just even more of a compliment and an honor to

699
00:42:33,903 --> 00:42:39,554
hear you guys paying it forward and to continue to
spread the gospel that is the Player's Handbook.

700
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:41,781
(laughter)

701
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,071
TRAVIS: The gospel.

702
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:47,285
MATT: You, sir.

703
00:42:47,285 --> 00:42:54,099
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is for Matt. How do
keep your homebrew classes, blood hunter, witch

704
00:42:54,099 --> 00:43:00,602
hunter kind of stuff, how do you work to keep those
balanced without making them totally crap or way overpowered?

705
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:05,626
MATT: Homebrew classes and races is a new thing to
me as well, like I never really created-- The

706
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:11,241
first real homebrew thing was just the transition
of your gunslinger over from Pathfinder and even

707
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:17,452
that took a while just testing and figuring it
out. Learning to balance something homebrew on

708
00:43:17,452 --> 00:43:21,001
that degree, especially a new class or a new
archetype? It's something that comes with

709
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:27,262
experience and with community feedback. While I'm
happy that I'm somewhat decent at D&amp;D, there's so

710
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:32,391
many great communities out there that are far more
knowledgeable of how the game's original design

711
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:37,861
construct was based on, what is considered good
versus bad balance. When I threw my stuff out

712
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:43,543
there--it was to the wolves in a way-- because
everyone was like, "This is broken, this messed up,"

713
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:46,754
and I'm like, cool, thank you for telling me that,
now I can go back and fix it. How about now? "This

714
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:52,684
"is-- oh, this is better now!" Internet may be angry
and forceful sometimes with its feedback, but as

715
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:55,734
long as it's still constructive and it's awesome,
which most of the community is, that's a

716
00:43:55,734 --> 00:44:00,833
tremendous source for you to use. There's the
Unearthed Arcana Reddit is a whole area that's all

717
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:05,635
about homebrew D&amp;D content and they're all very
knowledgeable and very willing to help you with

718
00:44:05,635 --> 00:44:07,365
feedback on your own homebrew ideas.

719
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:08,504
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Awesome, thank you.

720
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:09,744
MATT: Thank you.

721
00:44:09,744 --> 00:44:15,841
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Howdy, folks. My question is
actually for Portland, like a survey. So I'm going

722
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:16,885
to need some help here.

723
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:17,745
MARISHA: For Portland?

724
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:18,561
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.

725
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:20,234
MARISHA: All right, all the way into the mic.

726
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,735
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I'll need a some help here, like
the survey, but I'm thinking we have Scanlan Shorthalt

727
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:27,678
right here, can we please tell him that Trinket
should always go with the party?

728
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:28,785
LAURA: Yes!

729
00:44:28,785 --> 00:44:32,092
(cheering)

730
00:44:32,092 --> 00:44:33,931
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, Trinket!

731
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:38,014
LAURA: Don't you shake your head. You mother-- I
saw some of you shaking your damn head.

732
00:44:38,014 --> 00:44:41,324
TRAVIS: I heard a boo.

733
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:42,454
LAURA: I heard a boo.

734
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:43,297
MARISHA: I know.

735
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:45,668
LAURA: How dare you?

736
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:55,807
SAM: If Portland thinks so, who am I to argue with
that? Trinket is just an unstoppable force of

737
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,399
power, grace--

738
00:44:57,399 --> 00:45:01,313
LAURA: He has saved-- he has done some serious--

739
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:02,651
SAM: When he--

740
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:07,495
TALIESIN: I had to put my coat somewhere last
episode. That was very important.

741
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:09,480
SAM: When he saves me, I will respect him.

742
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,579
LAURA: He did save you! Didn't he?

743
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:12,530
SAM: No.

744
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,810
MARISHA: I think so. I think he did, like, once.

745
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,350
MATT: When CritRoleStats shakes his head no.

746
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:21,881
(laughter)

747
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:23,848
TRAVIS: The human encyclopedia says, "No."

748
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:30,211
LAURA: Wait, okay, but you know, how many times
has Trinket killed anybody?

749
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:32,610
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He bit a vampire's head off.

750
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,640
SAM: One?

751
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,980
LAURA: He bit a vampire's freaking head off!

752
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,820
SAM: Three.

753
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,475
LAURA: Three killings?

754
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:40,781
TRAVIS: Yeah, nine times.

755
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:42,101
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

756
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:44,567
MARISHA: Hey, hey, he's gotten two how do you want
to do this.

757
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:48,974
SAM: And I've killed at least that many. Listen,
Trinket is great.

758
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:50,988
TALIESIN: You're almost as useful as a bear.

759
00:45:50,988 --> 00:45:57,714
(laughter and cheering)

760
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:02,401
TRAVIS: I think it just needs to be solved PVP.
Scanlan versus Trinket.

761
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:03,671
SAM: Yeah, I would do that.

762
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:04,811
LAURA: No, that would be so sad.

763
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:06,448
TALIESIN: We could make a lot of money bear
wrestling.

764
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:08,783
LAURA: Trinket only has 60 hit points, you guys.

765
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:10,250
TRAVIS: Yeah, but what if he gets lucky?

766
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,576
TALIESIN: Gnome versus bear?

767
00:46:11,576 --> 00:46:15,840
LAURA: So that's why I don't send him in. He's
only got 60 hit points so if he dies then he dies

768
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,890
and I don't know what I would do.

769
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:24,542
TRAVIS: Y'all, this is truth. The one time before
the stream when I smacked the bear on the ass and

770
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:31,007
sent it through this minefield, I almost got
divorced. Like, <i>legitimately</i>.

771
00:46:31,007 --> 00:46:37,012
LAURA: I don't know. What I love is when we were
fighting the dragon at our keep and he got frozen.

772
00:46:37,012 --> 00:46:42,341
This was out of character, I'm looking at Travis
going, "You'd better fucking save--"

773
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:48,198
TRAVIS: I've got to save that fucking bear.
Because if he dies, there's no joy in the world.

774
00:46:48,198 --> 00:46:50,871
(laughter)

775
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:54,580
LAURA: I feel like that was the one time Grog
really acted out of character, when he saved Trinket.

776
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:00,512
TRAVIS: She would walk home and all the flowers in
the front yard would die. Save that bear, man.

777
00:47:00,512 --> 00:47:03,089
Rule number one.

778
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:08,424
SAM: I'm just saying that a ferret, or even a
goldfish...

779
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:12,749
TRAVIS: What is this, Hogwarts? Or an owl, or a
cat--

780
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:20,220
LAURA: If I could take the spell Polymorph, if I
could have that fucking spell, I would be so

781
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,315
happy. I hate that anytime I want to bring Trinket
and we're stealthing or something like that and

782
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:25,499
I'm like, "Marisha--"

783
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:26,880
MARISHA: Hopefully I've got it!

784
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,346
LAURA: "--can you use one of your spells that you
have a limited amount of to Polymorph my bear?"

785
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:33,493
TALIESIN: That red panda was pretty awesome.

786
00:47:33,493 --> 00:47:37,500
MARISHA: I can turn him into a red panda, that's
generally all I care about.

787
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,412
SAM: I can always do that. And I never will.

788
00:47:40,412 --> 00:47:46,384
(laughter)

789
00:47:46,384 --> 00:47:49,318
MARISHA: It's true! It's true, he always has it.

790
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:51,880
MATT: Don't be sad gnome, be happy gnome.

791
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,379
LAURA: You motherfucker! You could do it?

792
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:54,990
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. Rosie.

793
00:47:54,990 --> 00:48:03,412
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First of all, thank you, Laura,
for rolling a nat one on my die earlier. While I was

794
00:48:03,412 --> 00:48:08,250
in Beauty and the Beast, on the opening night,
Gaston's wig fell off, and I was wondering if you

795
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,150
guys ever had any embarrassing moments on stage.

796
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:20,551
MARISHA: Yeah, every episode? Let's cut to the
eight times between Laura and I that we've been

797
00:48:20,551 --> 00:48:27,624
like, we just (sobbing) oh God, oh God, this is
crying. I mean, that counts.

798
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:31,021
MATT: Do you mean during the show, or do you mean
legitimately on a theatrical stage?

799
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:32,220
AUDIENCE MEMBER: On a theatrical stage.

800
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,468
MATT: Okay, so an actual stage show.

801
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:34,250
MARISHA: Oh!

802
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,051
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

803
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:35,925
LAURA: Yes.

804
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:40,110
SAM: I was in Les Miserables as a child. I played
Gavroche.

805
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,210
MATT: And where did you play it?

806
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,572
SAM: You know, in Broadway.

807
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:49,012
(laughter)

808
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:58,747
SAM: I did a national tour and I was performing in
Miami-- it was a long time ago, like '89 or

809
00:48:58,747 --> 00:49:06,296
something -- anyway, I fell onstage and I injured
my knee and I was taken to the hospital. Long

810
00:49:06,296 --> 00:49:14,431
story, but I was wearing rags and dirt and stuff,
and I was brought to the hospital and it just so

811
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:23,451
happened that in Miami that night there were
riots. Martin Luther King Day riots or something?

812
00:49:23,451 --> 00:49:30,126
So they brought me in, this little boy, this
little white boy, and they were like, "Why are you

813
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:32,211
"here?" and I was like, "I fell off the
barricade."

814
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:37,968
(laughter)

815
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:46,090
SAM: And they were like, "There's a <i>barricade</i>?
Were you protesting?" And I was like, "I mean, I guess."

816
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,450
TRAVIS: Viva la revolución!

817
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:55,781
SAM: So they thought I was the youngest civil
rights protester ever.

818
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:57,411
TRAVIS: Little French boy.

819
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,978
MATT: That's amazing.

820
00:49:59,978 --> 00:50:02,860
MARISHA: I'd never heard that!

821
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,434
MATT: I don't think any of us can top that.

822
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:07,712
TRAVIS: Please tell me there's a Getty Images of
that somewhere.

823
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:09,079
SAM: I wish.

824
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,202
MATT: Good question. When I knocked over an
inkwell during a production of The Crucible, as

825
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:18,699
Reverend Hale. I slammed the table during the
trial for the latter half of the play. And whoever

826
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:22,161
was being the clerk of the court had filled the
inkwell with ink, which he wasn't supposed to do,

827
00:50:22,161 --> 00:50:27,647
but he wanted to write legitimately. I slammed the
table, and it (blurp) and spills out all

828
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:33,493
over my hand. I look down out of the corner of my
eye, and it's just like, blue ink across my hand,

829
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:39,052
and I'm trying to hide it. So someone else starts
talking, and Danforth, who's the guy running the

830
00:50:39,052 --> 00:50:46,572
whole trial, starts getting really angry, and I
raise my finger to point. Ink all up his white

831
00:50:46,572 --> 00:50:53,681
shirt, across his face. He feels it, and he
doesn't know what it is, he just knows he's got

832
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:56,952
something on his face. So he goes and tries to rub
off the "spittle," and there's this giant ink

833
00:50:56,952 --> 00:51:01,668
smear across his face. None of us could tell him,
so he did most of the second half of the play just

834
00:51:01,668 --> 00:51:04,867
with giant ink smears on his face. Yeah.

835
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,433
SAM: That's pretty good.

836
00:51:07,433 --> 00:51:08,753
MATT: Theater.

837
00:51:08,753 --> 00:51:15,763
LAURA: Oh, man. In high school I was doing this
play, and this guy that I had the biggest crush on

838
00:51:15,763 --> 00:51:23,082
ever was sitting in the front row. I had one of
those hoop skirts on, and I sat down on the couch,

839
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:29,843
and I wasn't used to them. The hoop went up over
my head, and it was like a dress rehearsal, so I

840
00:51:29,843 --> 00:51:36,162
didn't have the full costume on. So it was just,
like, underwear. So it was just like, hoop, and

841
00:51:36,162 --> 00:51:38,572
panties. And I was mortified.

842
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:40,388
TRAVIS: Yes!

843
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:45,263
LAURA: (to inaudible audience member) No! He was
never my boyfriend!

844
00:51:45,263 --> 00:51:46,831
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

845
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:48,164
LAURA: I am sure!

846
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:50,745
MARISHA: It's like a skin you can download in
Portal. It's great.

847
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:54,323
LAURA: I also did a production of Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and I was playing

848
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:56,451
the narrator, and I was running out on stage.

849
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:57,984
TRAVIS: And you ate shit.

850
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:02,472
LAURA: I did. I ate shit. As I was running out,
leading the entire chorus out to do this big dance

851
00:52:02,472 --> 00:52:08,170
number for "Go, Go, Go, Joseph," and my foot
caught in my skirt. I just planted it on the stage

852
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,590
and slid, and then had to get up and finish the
dance out.

853
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,562
TALIESIN: I got beat up by a goat on camera once.

854
00:52:15,562 --> 00:52:17,253
(laughter)

855
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:21,222
TALIESIN: It was some show called Hell Town. It
only went, like, 12 episodes, and I was some

856
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:27,206
autistic kid who befriends a goat. That goat was
not friendly. That goat just jumped me and nailed

857
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:33,068
me in the face. I was cut. It was just bad. It was
a little goat, but I was a little kid, and it was

858
00:52:33,068 --> 00:52:37,041
like, "Finally, a human I can beat the fuck out
of!"

859
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:41,407
TRAVIS: Why have we not killed a goat in the game as
vengeance for your real-life--?

860
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,151
TALIESIN: I've already taken care of that.

861
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:50,892
MARISHA: I guess the best one that I have-- it's
hard to top Gavroche. I was in a production of The

862
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:59,521
Nutcracker, and I was a soldier. We had to come
through the flat on the stage, and we had these

863
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:08,503
hats that came down, and we were soldiers, and I
missed the entrance and slammed into the flat.

864
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:14,002
Anyone who does theater, you know these flats are
made out of cardboard, so the whole thing went--

865
00:53:14,002 --> 00:53:18,136
(shaking noise) and almost fell over.

866
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:19,382
LAURA: Oh, but it didn't.

867
00:53:19,382 --> 00:53:20,874
MARISHA: It didn't fall over, but--

868
00:53:20,874 --> 00:53:22,123
LAURA: Could have been worse.

869
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:25,727
MARISHA: It was very obvious that I smacked into a
flat. The entire section.

870
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:27,492
TRAVIS: I burned down a theater and killed
everybody inside.

871
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:28,872
SAM: Oh, wow.

872
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:32,142
TRAVIS: But nobody knows about that, so--

873
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:38,197
MATT: We should go. Now. You should-- okay, next
question.

874
00:53:38,197 --> 00:53:42,574
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm Commander Shepard, and this
is my favorite show on the Citadel.

875
00:53:42,574 --> 00:53:44,252
LAURA: Nice.

876
00:53:44,252 --> 00:53:52,851
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, serious DM question here. As
a DM who has a party of some odd races-- a mouse,

877
00:53:52,851 --> 00:54:01,174
a fire genasi, and soon to be a tiefling-- your
game has a goliath. Travis, you can help me with

878
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:05,963
this one as well. Your game has a goliath
who seems to have a history as a marauder,

879
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:07,099
to put it nicely.

880
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:08,033
TRAVIS: A what?

881
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:08,925
SAM: A marauder.

882
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:10,329
TRAVIS: A marauder. That's a big word.

883
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:16,603
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So did that ever have any role
play issues early on? You have this big goliath

884
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:22,200
walking around town that used to be wandering
around in the fields robbing people, beating

885
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,575
people up, stuff like that.

886
00:54:23,575 --> 00:54:29,588
MATT: It was interesting, because his father had
actually left his tribe, his band. They're

887
00:54:29,588 --> 00:54:34,285
basically just like wild-living savage bandits
that destroyed and pillaged whatever came in their

888
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:41,633
territory. His father had separated from them
after his early trials, and made a name of himself

889
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:47,993
in the city of Westruun as a respectable
individual. That's how when he went and met Pike,

890
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:52,752
there wasn't-- People were not comfortable with
him in the city, and stayed away from him, but

891
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:59,132
there was no all of a sudden, immediate force of
the local guard going like, "I don't trust you.

892
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:03,842
"We're going to lock you up and cut your face." So
that wasn't a huge issue. But the band is still

893
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,032
out there.

894
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:06,231
TALIESIN: We ran into--

895
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:11,364
MATT: You did run into them once. It was a
large-scale battle with all these goliaths jumping

896
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:17,132
out. And the party was like, "We are so ruined."
The fight was about to go, and I think it was the

897
00:55:17,132 --> 00:55:26,725
first time that I've ever had Grog stop fighting
and socially talk the party out of battle. Grog!

898
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:29,673
TALIESIN: It was amazing.

899
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:34,902
TRAVIS: It turned out to be one of my cousins,
which goes into a backstory thing that will

900
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:40,043
probably come up at some point, but I didn't want
to fight my family. Because we would have probably

901
00:55:40,043 --> 00:55:42,212
all died. It was like seven goliaths.

902
00:55:42,212 --> 00:55:44,503
LAURA: We probably-- yeah.

903
00:55:44,503 --> 00:55:46,140
TRAVIS: It would have been bad.

904
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,313
TALIESIN: It was a while ago.

905
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:49,575
TRAVIS: But he gets one pass. And then he's dead.

906
00:55:49,575 --> 00:55:51,307
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As it should be.

907
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:54,198
SAM: You, sir.

908
00:55:54,198 --> 00:56:00,333
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First things first. Scanlan, as a
bard, you are a huge hero and inspiration to myself.

909
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:04,000
(cheering)

910
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,106
SAM: I know.

911
00:56:05,106 --> 00:56:12,391
TRAVIS: Don't tell him that. Can we get a Bigby's
Hand?

912
00:56:12,391 --> 00:56:13,851
SAM: (sings) Bigby's Hand!

913
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:16,633
(applause)

914
00:56:16,633 --> 00:56:18,495
SAM: It's not even a bard spell!

915
00:56:18,495 --> 00:56:19,652
MATT: I know!

916
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:25,768
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As characters, Vox Machina, do
you consider yourselves to be heroes? Do you

917
00:56:25,768 --> 00:56:27,375
actively try to be heroes?

918
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,832
MARISHA: You're asking us as Vox Machina?

919
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:30,988
SAM: I mean--

920
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,601
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You've done some pretty horrible
things.

921
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:34,337
LAURA: We have done some pretty terrible things.

922
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:37,800
SAM: Collectively, we are heroic.

923
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,171
TALIESIN: Yes, collectively.

924
00:56:39,171 --> 00:56:51,028
SAM: Individually. I don't think-- Scanlan thinks of
himself as a god that doesn't really need to prove

925
00:56:51,028 --> 00:56:57,751
anything. He's just in it for the lols, for the
most part. But I think collectively we've done

926
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,327
some good things. We've saved civilization.

927
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:01,914
LAURA: We've done some terrible things, too.

928
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:05,784
SAM: We've rescued people, and we've killed old
people, which is always a good thing for society.

929
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:08,970
(laughter)

930
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:13,851
TALIESIN: Percy's kind of starting to figure out
that he's not that great a person, but--

931
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:16,853
TRAVIS: (laughs)

932
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:21,412
TALIESIN: I knew, but Percy didn't know. But at
the same time, it's mostly because he's

933
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:26,793
acknowledging that we're all kind of awful people,
but together-- except for Pike. Pike's great.

934
00:57:26,793 --> 00:57:35,083
Pike's fine. But together we're actually a
powerful force for good. Individually, not so much.

935
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:38,542
TRAVIS: Grog lives moment to moment. I have no
idea what they're talking about.

936
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:47,814
LAURA: I feel like Vax is a really good person.
Vax is probably, outside of Pike--

937
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:52,795
MARISHA: Vax is probably the best person. Vax is
probably most selfless.

938
00:57:52,795 --> 00:57:55,243
LAURA: Yeah, because he really is in it to--

939
00:57:55,243 --> 00:57:58,084
TALIESIN: Percy would have words about that.

940
00:57:58,084 --> 00:57:59,964
LAURA: Oh, really?

941
00:57:59,964 --> 00:58:02,474
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

942
00:58:02,506 --> 00:58:04,534
LAURA: Has he done some shit?
I feel like I'm speaking for Liam now.

943
00:58:04,534 --> 00:58:06,504
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can't RP for Vax.

944
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:09,491
LAURA: I can't speak for Liam, but based on
conversations that we've had.

945
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:11,288
TRAVIS: Why don't you speak for yourself?

946
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:13,943
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't really have these
conversations. We try and keep it for the game.

947
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:17,245
TRAVIS: Is this meta right now?

948
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,434
TALIESIN: This is meta.

949
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:19,544
MATT: Roll initiative.

950
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:21,308
(laughter)

951
00:58:21,308 --> 00:58:23,366
MARISHA: Are we going to get shat on for
metagaming?

952
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,357
LAURA: Ah!

953
00:58:24,357 --> 00:58:25,723
MATT: I don't know.

954
00:58:25,723 --> 00:58:27,283
TRAVIS: We're all going to die! You killed us!

955
00:58:27,283 --> 00:58:28,662
LAURA: We're all going to die!

956
00:58:28,662 --> 00:58:29,940
TALIESIN: Way to go.

957
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:43,103
SAM: I will tell you this, though. Scanlan is a
bit of an existentialist, and, for a specific

958
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:49,960
reason, thinks or has thought up to now that life is
sort of pointless.

959
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,025
LAURA: Aww!

960
00:58:51,025 --> 00:58:52,702
TALIESIN: I see that.

961
00:58:52,702 --> 00:58:53,853
LAURA: Look at this guy!

962
00:58:53,853 --> 00:58:57,558
MARISHA: It's interesting, actually, all the
different ideals our characters have evolved.

963
00:58:57,558 --> 00:58:59,061
TRAVIS: Yeah, ideals.

964
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:01,814
(laughter)

965
00:59:01,814 --> 00:59:06,160
LAURA: I get, sometimes, people online saying I've done
something that's really terrible.

966
00:59:06,195 --> 00:59:08,272
TRAVIS: They're right.

967
00:59:08,272 --> 00:59:12,910
LAURA: But for Vex, the motivation makes sense. It
makes sense, the reason she would do certain things.

968
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:13,884
TRAVIS: Oh, sure.

969
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,964
LAURA: And it's not bad in her eyes. It's not.

970
00:59:15,964 --> 00:59:22,587
MARISHA: Everyone loves to comment on if Keyleth
did something right or wrong. Everyone seems to

971
00:59:22,587 --> 00:59:28,384
have an opinion. And once again, people need to
understand where Keyleth is coming from.

972
00:59:28,384 --> 00:59:30,350
LAURA: Keyleth is the worst of all of us.

973
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,474
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. By far. She killed a kid.

974
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:33,721
MARISHA: I'm the evil bastard.

975
00:59:33,721 --> 00:59:35,113
LAURA: Heart of ice.

976
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:40,364
MARISHA: Honestly, like legitimately, Keyleth has
probably done some of the worst stuff that's also

977
00:59:40,364 --> 00:59:44,987
trying the hardest, so it just really messes with
her psyche.

978
00:59:44,987 --> 00:59:46,710
TRAVIS: It's my favorite part.

979
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,744
MARISHA: It's true. I'm the worst! I try so hard.

980
00:59:48,744 --> 00:59:51,453
TALIESIN: It's not that we're not heroes, it's
that we're flawed. We're flawed people.

981
00:59:51,453 --> 00:59:53,574
MARISHA: We're extremely flawed. Everyone's
broken.

982
00:59:53,574 --> 00:59:55,428
TRAVIS: We're a bunch of idiots, come on.

983
00:59:55,428 --> 01:00:00,072
MARISHA: We have no fucking clue what we're doing.
Ever.

984
01:00:00,072 --> 01:00:01,393
MATT: We've got about five minutes left.

985
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:03,831
SAM: Two more questions, maybe?

986
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,270
MATT: If there are two or three we can get through
quickly.

987
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:09,426
TRAVIS: Bless you! Can we name an NPC after him or
something?

988
01:00:09,426 --> 01:00:12,565
TALIESIN: He's just going to get killed in five
minutes.

989
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:14,914
TRAVIS: Just make him the beer delivery guy!

990
01:00:14,914 --> 01:00:17,642
SAM: Dean is your next NPC.

991
01:00:17,642 --> 01:00:19,155
TRAVIS: We've got to build him a room!

992
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:21,821
(cheering)

993
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:24,338
TRAVIS: (excitedly) Beer wench!

994
01:00:24,338 --> 01:00:31,894
LAURA: You guys, we're seriously going to be so
not functional.

995
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:36,988
TALIESIN: This is going to slow down the autograph
lines so much. There's going to be so many

996
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:38,596
misspellings and typos.

997
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:40,235
TRAVIS: We're going to sign one letter at a time.

998
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:42,883
LAURA: If we spell your name wrong later--

999
01:00:42,883 --> 01:00:44,713
TRAVIS: Yes. Go for it! We've got five minutes.

1000
01:00:44,713 --> 01:00:46,610
MARISHA: Do you want my leftover one?

1001
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,139
MATT: She gives me the half-drunk one.

1002
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:53,450
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First, I want to thank y'all.
Y'all are the reason my wife and I play D&amp;D

1003
01:00:53,450 --> 01:01:02,246
together now, so thank you for that. Secondly, as
a DM of seven players-- so I feel that pain a

1004
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:06,422
little bit-- as players, is there anything y'all
have ever wanted to do in game, but have thought,

1005
01:01:06,422 --> 01:01:11,434
"No, that would eat up too much time. There's
eight of us. We need to get the story moving

1006
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:15,232
"along." Or do y'all just, "Nope, everyone can
wait, and I'm going to have my two-hour moment."

1007
01:01:15,232 --> 01:01:19,085
TALIESIN: I try and have my attack plan ready for
when it's my turn to fight.

1008
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:20,647
MARISHA: Yeah.

1009
01:01:20,647 --> 01:01:26,773
TALIESIN: I don't start looking at the board when
it's like, "All right, you're up." No. Okay, I'm good.

1010
01:01:26,773 --> 01:01:31,264
TRAVIS: I feel like Matt does a pretty good job,
too, of being clairvoyant and sensing that if we

1011
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:35,493
start to do something that's going to go way off
on a tangent and take up too much time, he'll cut

1012
01:01:35,493 --> 01:01:39,298
it off the second we start it, and he'll bring
something up that puts us back on

1013
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:41,370
a more cohesive track.

1014
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:45,342
SAM: But he also allows us to go on our little
individual journeys when we need to.

1015
01:01:45,342 --> 01:01:48,496
MATT: It's a fun little exploration element.

1016
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:53,674
TRAVIS: That's where the black powder guy
came from, is some random tangent. Most

1017
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:54,914
amazing NPC ever.

1018
01:01:54,914 --> 01:01:57,360
TALIESIN: He put the fear into me because he
said I was going to run out of bullets and powder

1019
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,201
soon. I was like, "Oh god, you're right!" And I
didn't know what to do about that.

1020
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:01,919
TRAVIS: And then you cast Friends on me, you
dick.

1021
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:06,832
LAURA: I always feel slightly guilty any time we
have a shopping excursion--

1022
01:02:06,832 --> 01:02:10,472
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Because that can eat up time with
even four players, let alone seven or eight.

1023
01:02:10,472 --> 01:02:15,460
LAURA: Exactly. And not only because it's probably
boring for the other players, but I feel like it's

1024
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,661
really boring for you guys to watch us go buy
potions.

1025
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:22,289
TRAVIS: Shopping's awesome. I love going shopping
with other people.

1026
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:25,125
(laughter)

1027
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:31,171
MATT: It can be fun. It's about knowing as a GM
when to edit a scene. You can let things happen,

1028
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:35,620
let it be fun, let interactions occur, and then
once you feel like the goal of that scene has been

1029
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:40,215
completed or is close to resolution, you can nudge
the party and be like, "All right, so from this

1030
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:45,102
"point, where do you want to go from here?" Or "As
time passes, you continue the transaction." You

1031
01:02:45,102 --> 01:02:51,061
can find a point where the fun has been had, the
major arc of that moment has hit, and you can help

1032
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:54,640
hurry and bookend and then continue the next
moment.

1033
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,759
SAM: That's the hardest thing to do in improv is
to both be in the scene and know when the scene is

1034
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:02,500
over. That's super hard.

1035
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:08,500
MARISHA: And we're also a bunch of A
personalities, so sometimes you have to fight if

1036
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:13,709
you want to have a moment. If you want to have
something, you have to not be afraid to jump in.

1037
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:19,731
And you've probably seen a hundred times where
some of us have started to do something, and then

1038
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:26,179
it might have gotten cut off, and then you have to
let it go. You move on. Just like in life,

1039
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:29,788
sometimes it is not the right time or the right
place.

1040
01:03:29,788 --> 01:03:33,177
SAM: What we're saying is you should sit down
now.

1041
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,201
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's more deep than what I
wanted.

1042
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:38,291
MATT: We've got time for probably one or two more
fast questions. If we don't get to your questions

1043
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:41,345
here, you're welcome to come and ask us at our
signing later.

1044
01:03:41,345 --> 01:03:43,605
LAURA: And we also have a panel tomorrow.

1045
01:03:43,605 --> 01:03:45,043
MATT: We also have a panel tomorrow at noon.

1046
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:48,612
LAURA: Not here. In room C-123.

1047
01:03:48,612 --> 01:03:53,509
TRAVIS: C-123 tomorrow. And we're at our
tables. When we're not here, we're at our tables

1048
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:55,017
the whole time.

1049
01:03:55,017 --> 01:04:02,347
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How hard was it to transition the
gunslinger from Pathfinder over to what you guys

1050
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:07,930
do? Because for one of the games I'm a part of, my
girlfriend wants to be a dracomancer, and I didn't

1051
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:12,699
realize that was in 4E, so I'm having trouble
helping her get it up to this one.

1052
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:19,919
MATT: That's a tough one. For me, the archetypes,
especially for fighter and combat-based

1053
01:04:19,919 --> 01:04:24,100
archetypes, it's much more cut and dry as far as
the transition for natural physics. A gunslinger,

1054
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:30,668
we know how ballistics work and some of the
possible tropes for gunslingers in modern media,

1055
01:04:30,668 --> 01:04:34,062
so that was an easy inspiration to transition and
change some of the things and still make it

1056
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:39,080
interesting. When you get into stuff like that,
where you're dealing with more obtuse magics and

1057
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:45,019
other creatures that are mythological, if you're
having a hard time, reach out to a community of

1058
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:49,210
homebrewers like the Unearthed Arcana guys, and
ask for suggestions there. There may be things

1059
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:53,851
that are already existing that are a good root or
basis that you can then tweak more into what you

1060
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:57,931
want your final homebrew to be. And now there's
the DMs' Guild, which allows everyone to put up

1061
01:04:57,931 --> 01:05:02,937
their own homebrew stuff online, and there's a lot
of great content there that you can find people

1062
01:05:02,937 --> 01:05:05,971
with, and if you like it, you can toss them a
couple of bucks and show them how much you

1063
01:05:05,971 --> 01:05:09,400
appreciate it. I think it's really cool that
they've opened up the community to create their

1064
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,280
own homebrew content and provide it like that.

1065
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,187
TALIESIN: For safety, how many revisions have you
given me?

1066
01:05:15,187 --> 01:05:17,659
MATT: The gunslinger? Probably close to eight, at
this point.

1067
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:20,631
TALIESIN: About eight?

1068
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:22,690
TRAVIS: One more question.

1069
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,896
MATT: Thank you very much.

1070
01:05:23,896 --> 01:05:25,090
MARISHA: I hope it's a good one.

1071
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,000
MATT: Come by later on and we'll get to your guys'
questions later on.

1072
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,400
TRAVIS: Because everybody from here over has to
pee so bad.

1073
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,565
MARISHA: So bad! We've drank three beers in an
hour.

1074
01:05:34,565 --> 01:05:36,331
TRAVIS: We had a whole cask of ale from here
over.

1075
01:05:36,331 --> 01:05:41,931
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is a personal
question for Matt, so I'm sorry it's not a whole

1076
01:05:41,931 --> 01:05:50,283
group question. I'm just so curious. You've
inspired me to start writing again and to start

1077
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:58,600
playing D&amp;D-- I'm really nervous-- and to remember
to myself to be who I want to be and to start

1078
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:03,501
writing again, I bought my wristband because I
watch you. I see you; you wear yours constantly.

1079
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:08,653
Mine, I got nautical-themed since my husband's in
the navy. It's got a ship wheel and a kraken. I

1080
01:06:08,653 --> 01:06:13,101
wondered, do yours have any significance? You wear
them constantly. Do they mean anything?

1081
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:17,429
MATT: That's a very interesting question. They do,
actually. Each wristband I keep on me, not just

1082
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:21,939
from a visual standpoint, but each has a very
specific meaning. This first wristband here was

1083
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:26,501
actually gifted to me by somebody in the middle of
the desert at my first Burning Man, and it's a

1084
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:29,530
representation of personal responsibility and
understanding where I came from and where I want

1085
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:34,545
to go and make sure that I don't stray from that
path and be true to myself. It's a long story

1086
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:37,315
where it got that meaning, but that's essentially
what it means.

1087
01:06:37,315 --> 01:06:42,590
This one here was actually granted to me by my
best friend Brittany Wallach for my birthday many

1088
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:46,393
years ago. That's her right there.

1089
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,492
(cheering)

1090
01:06:48,492 --> 01:06:53,669
MATT: This represents friendship and the people
that have held me in my dark times and got me to

1091
01:06:53,669 --> 01:06:57,640
where I am today, because honestly, no individual
gets there. It's a bunch of people that bring you

1092
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:05,029
to your final fated future. Thank you, Brittany.
And this band here-- if you get a chance to look,

1093
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:10,161
it has a bunch of numbers printed into it-- this
was made by Marisha for our anniversary a few

1094
01:07:10,161 --> 01:07:17,210
years ago. She dyed the leather, she printed in
the numbers, and these numbers represent the

1095
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:20,260
actual coordinates of the beach where we had our
first kiss.

1096
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,240
AUDIENCE: Aww!

1097
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,415
SAM: Gross.

1098
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:27,951
MATT: I know, right? So yeah, each of these have a
very special significance to me and are constant

1099
01:07:27,951 --> 01:07:30,331
reminders of good moments and people in my life.

1100
01:07:30,331 --> 01:07:31,444
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you so much.

1101
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:32,570
MATT: Thank you! It was a good question.

1102
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:33,520
TRAVIS: Great question.

1103
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,800
SAM: This was a fun panel, Matt. You did great
moderating.

1104
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,004
LAURA: You've been awesome.

1105
01:07:38,004 --> 01:07:39,280
SAM: I'm drunk.

1106
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,240
MATT: Good!

1107
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,088
(cheering)

1108
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:45,371
MATT: And you guys did a great job making that
happen.

1109
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:47,182
(cheering)

1110
01:07:47,182 --> 01:07:59,274
TRAVIS: We love that you guys are here! So we will
be at the group signing table at 4:00. From 4:00

1111
01:07:59,274 --> 01:08:02,710
to 5:00 we'll be there; it's a short run, so if we
don't get to everybody, that's okay. We'll be over

1112
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:07,633
at our tables until the close of the day, and then
we'll be back here when the hall opens tomorrow,

1113
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:12,200
as well. We have another panel and a group signing
tomorrow, as well. Thank you so much for coming out!

1114
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,239
MATT: Thank you so much!

1115
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,690
MARISHA: Thank you, guys! We have to pee because
you've given us so many beers.

1116
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:24,103
MATT: So 4:00 group signing, we'll be at our tables
after that, and then we'll be there tomorrow.

1117
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:28,730
Thank you all so much. Is it Thursday yet?

1118
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,238
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Oh.
