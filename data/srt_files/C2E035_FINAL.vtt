NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.308
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:06.160
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.291
ALL: Dungeons & Dragons!

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:11.070
MATT: Before we get into tonight's game, we have
some announcements to get through, so be patient

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.256
with us for a moment as we give a big shout out
and thanks to our two sponsors for tonight's

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:18.627
episode, starting with our friends at D&D Beyond.
Sam?

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:24.939
SAM: As I said last week, the Waterdeep: Dragon
Heist is now available on D&D Beyond. As Max said

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.894
last week. They'll guide your Waterdeep campaign
from levels one to five. After that, explore the

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:35.662
legendary Undermountain Dungeon below the city
with Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage for levels

00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:41.573
five through 20! Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad
Mage is available for pre-order on D&D Beyond and

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:52.605
will release November 2nd. Now, because D&D Beyond
is such a generous sponsor of this show, Laura, I

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:59.820
wanted to show the audience some of what we do
with that sponsorship money. We take it and we

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.044
turn it into this amazing studio which has amazing
equipment and after effects and editing suites and

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:15.909
cool special effects, so we put together a really
cool ad for them using all the equipment, and if

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.910
you guys would turn to the monitor and see what we
made.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.745
TRAVIS: What.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:20.450
LAURA: Oh no.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.530
SAM: Hi, guys! As you know, we love
D&D Beyond.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.398
It's easy to use, the interface is super high
tech. Since their sponsorship helps us make this

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:34.069
show, we thought we'd use all the cutting edge
editing software in our fabulous new studio to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:42.127
make D&D Beyond a mind-blowing special effects ad.
(explosions) Explosions, I assume. For instance,

00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:48.939
look at my face. Looks normal now, right? But when
we add high tech CGI effects: Oh, I look like a

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:59.898
beholder! Roar! Antimagic cone! D&D Beyond! Okay,
reset. Now, check out this awesome face swapping

00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:07.756
feature. Okay, right now, I look like Sam Riegel.
But now (whoop). Oh, I'm Matt Mercer. Welcome to

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:14.545
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice
actors get to look at how handsome I am. Oh, now

00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:21.659
I'm doing a Cajun accent. Okay, reset. But that's
not all. Now, it looks like I'm holding nothing,

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:28.739
right? But now, with special effects. (gasp) Oh!
I've got an adorable blink dog in my hands. Aw,

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.440
isn't Nugget so cute? And reset. Wow, that was
just a taste of the amazing special effects that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.171
D&D Beyond sponsorship covers here at the studio.
Thanks, D&D Beyond, and if you don't mind, Scotty,

00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:51.167
beam me up! I'm probably gone by now, right? That
was great! Thanks, Max. I can't wait to see how it

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:55.060
cuts together. I can't wait to see all the
effects.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.900
SAM: They didn't put any fucking effects on. I
mean, we had it all mapped out. It was going to be

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.291
amazing, and now it's just--

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:10.950
LAURA: It's really lame.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.536
SAM: It's pretty lame, and also kind of insulting
to Matt. I mean, if you want to be honest about

00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:22.492
it. Sorry to the audience, and sorry to D&D
Beyond. Back to you, Matt!

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:25.027
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:25.027 --> 00:03:30.340
TRAVIS: Yet more evidence why we should see the
return of Max "Better Sam" James.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:47.487
MATT: All righty. One of these days, your
escalation is going to be the end of us all. Not

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:48.945
looking forward to it.

00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:52.098
SAM: Guys, for D&D Beyond, I brought a loaded
gun!

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.381
MATT: One of these days.

00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:59.426
SAM: Guys, it's really amazing!

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:07.976
MATT: Oh my god. On sale now we do have our very
first live show in New York City. It's coming up

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:13.099
pretty soon, actually, in two weeks. We'll be at
the United Palace in Washington Heights, Thursday,

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.949
October 4th for the live show. Tickets are still
available now at Ticketmaster. You can check out

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.226
all the details to do so at critrole.com.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:23.066
LAURA: I'm sorry. No, just keep talking.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:28.162
MATT: I got to get it out now. Better now, than in
the narrative. Also, for those who had a chance to

00:04:28.162 --> 00:04:33.268
see it, thank you so much for tuning in to this
week's episode of Between the Sheets, our new show

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:39.931
hosted by the fantastic Brian W. Foster. Taliesin
was our first guinea pig for that. Really

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:41.808
in-depth, awesome interview, and peek behind
the--

00:04:41.808 --> 00:04:44.734
TALIESIN: Really blitzed on that stuff, it was
pretty fun.

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:47.417
LIAM: Why did we start with a closer, though?

00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:52.108
TALIESIN: Let's just start on grain alcohol, also.
That was a good call on my part.

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:58.536
MATT: Well done, Taliesin. If you want to talk a
little bit about the release schedule for that

00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:00.259
show, for Between the Sheets, it's every--

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.221
MARISHA: Every Monday, 7:00pm on Twitch is where
it premieres. Then, of course, you can immediately

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:13.909
catch it on VOD on Twitch if you've subscribed to
us on Critical Role's Twitch. Critical Role's

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:20.819
Twitch! I don't know; I'm pulling a Sam Riegel,
I'm adding graphics that aren't here. There's a

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:30.327
graphic, right? Then it releases on Wednesdays on
Critical Role's YouTube channel at 10:00am, so if

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:34.065
you do not catch it live or if you are not
subscribed, you'll get it on Wednesday.

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:39.756
MATT: There you go, and to celebrate the launch of
Between the Sheets, Brian's going to be doing a

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:50.842
Reddit AMA tomorrow at 2:00pm Pacific. If you want
to go ahead and razz him through text format, see

00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:57.503
him on the Critical Role Reddit tomorrow at 2:00pm
Pacific. We've been raising a lot great money for

00:05:57.503 --> 00:06:00.457
Sam's charity, Pablove Foundation, if you want to
talk a little bit about that?

00:06:00.457 --> 00:06:06.226
SAM: Yes, the charity that I'm very fond of,
Pablove Foundation, they battle childhood cancer.

00:06:06.226 --> 00:06:11.116
What am I supposed to talk about tonight? I'm
supposed to talk about the fact that because you

00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:16.193
guys raised so much money, we're doing a one-shot
tomorrow night on the Critical Role Twitch

00:06:16.193 --> 00:06:23.404
channel. We're going to do a Crash Pandas one-shot
with me as the Game Master and people like Laura

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:26.709
Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, Travis
Willingham--

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.606
LAURA: I still have my purse on!

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:34.203
SAM: -- Matt Mercer. Basically everyone at this
table except for Taliesin will be there.

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:37.172
TALIESIN: I got some shit to do, people.

00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:40.636
MATT: Got enough coverage this week already; he
can sit out a bit.

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:47.971
SAM: Tune in tomorrow night at 7:00 to see the
show. We will also be giving away prizes to some

00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:54.740
lucky person who made a donation and tagged
Critical Role in the donation field. That's it! Yay!

00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:57.543
MATT: Great. Laura, you said you wanted to talk
about merch stuff?

00:06:57.543 --> 00:07:00.468
LAURA: Yeah! We got some things back in stock,
y'all.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.517
TRAVIS: You're still wearing your purse, by the
way

00:07:02.517 --> 00:07:04.494
LAURA: No, I'm not, stop it.

00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:06.078
MARISHA: She had to think about it, though.

00:07:06.078 --> 00:07:10.234
LAURA: I did! We got the Wildemount dice back in
stock! The pretty blue ones that we have and then

00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:16.610
we got limited amount of The Mighty Nein pins back
in stock. Check that out right now; they're

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:25.723
awesome. We have the maps back in stock, and I
have heard the t-shirts are being restocked very

00:07:25.723 --> 00:07:29.734
shortly. That means check it out this weekend,
like Friday or Monday. They should be back in

00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:31.471
there so check it out.

00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:32.656
SAM: Refresh!

00:07:32.656 --> 00:07:35.355
LAURA: Just refresh, and if you want them, they
should be there.

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:38.976
MATT: There you go. Thank you, Laura, and a thank
you to our second sponsor. I wanted to bookend it,

00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:44.193
sponsor-sponsor. Returning is our friend here, The
Rook and The Raven, who have been doing their

00:07:44.193 --> 00:07:47.402
awesome-- if you guys aren't familiar, haven't
seen the previous episodes-- these really awesome,

high quality, discbound gaming notebooks for your
campaign. The fronts, you can see, are laser

00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:59.985
etched designs of awesome maps from our fantastic
friend, Deven Rue, who did our Dwendalian Empire

00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:04.178
map earlier in the campaign, which you saw, and
just came into stock, apparently. This is their

00:08:04.178 --> 00:08:07.293
Mischief and Misadventure book where you can go
ahead and put all your campaign notes and your

00:08:07.293 --> 00:08:13.649

so if you haven't got in on it, now's your last
chance to do so. This is your last chance to get

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:35.879
SAM: Yay sponsors!

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:36.550
LAURA: Woo!

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.469
MATT: All of the sweet effects, Sam.

00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:42.921
SAM: Yeah, someone will add some effects at some
point.

00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.112
MATT: At some point.

00:08:44.112 --> 00:08:44.843
TALIESIN: Pew pew.

00:08:44.843 --> 00:08:48.906
MATT: I feel like we're really going to have to
release that now with effects put onto it.

00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:51.211
TRAVIS: Arsequeef will take care of it.

00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:59.734
MATT: Yeah, he will. Without further ado, let's go
ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:09:00.543 --> 00:09:04.577
[click, TV static]

00:09:04.577 --> 00:10:22.338
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:28.445
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty
Nein had found their way outside of the Dwendalian

00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:35.160
Empire and to the first city along the coast of
the Menagerie Coast, Nicodranas, where Fjord had

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.814
passed through previously on his various
adventures through the waters nearby, and Jester's

00:10:39.814 --> 00:10:47.680
upbringing was entirely within. You had met with
Jester's mother, Marion, The Ruby of the Sea, as

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:54.451
well as began to seek information about an
individual that was connected with your time up at

00:10:54.451 --> 00:11:00.954
Shadycreek Run and the sphere that you had
absorbed, Fjord. In this period of time, you

00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:06.355
discovered there was an individual that had grown
jealous and strangely aggressive regarding the

00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:12.203
companionship of Jester's mother and as such, you
began to seek information about them in a way to

00:11:12.203 --> 00:11:23.474
put an end to this behavior. In doing so, you went
to a tavern and met a captain who had possibly

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:31.108
room for a few of you to travel with about a week
from now. You met a tortle-- for many of you, the

00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:37.208
first time you've encountered a tortle-- who had
some interesting things to say and a lead on the

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:43.111
individual you were looking for. You also found
information about what's called the Sluice Weave,

00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:51.208
a series of waterways beneath the city where this
Algar, this individual that was creating tension

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:57.188
with The Ruby of the Sea, works and oversees. You
made your way to the outskirts of the docks,

00:11:57.188 --> 00:12:01.500
searched through the water for an entrance,
managed to muscle your way through the grates

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:07.870
below, nearly drowning the pets you had recently
purchased. You encountered a few small water

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:15.558
elementals and eventually came upon one of the
nexus areas of this waterway where there was an

00:12:15.558 --> 00:12:24.591
elemental entity named Zsundie that was bound to
this location and was helping run and control the

00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:31.989
water in and out, under the supervision of Algar.
Catching them, but, however, not being as stealthy

00:12:31.989 --> 00:12:39.225
as you had hoped, you were noticed, and as such, a
battle commenced where Zsundie, this elemental

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:47.448
figure, was given the command by Algar to take
care of you and see you out. In this fray, a

00:12:47.448 --> 00:12:55.178
number of you fell and fell again, but through a
combination of Fjord's teleportation spell

00:12:55.178 --> 00:13:02.079
abilities, you guys keeping each other alive, you
repeatedly punching very hard whatever got in your

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:13.315
way, you managed to subdue Algar, destroy his two
guards, raised one as a specter, and noticing that

00:13:13.315 --> 00:13:17.533
there was something affixed to his wrist that
seemed to have some connection with Zsundie, Fjord

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:27.064
cut his left hand off. And that's where we pick
up. The rest of you are slowly pulling your way,

00:13:27.064 --> 00:13:32.947
your bodies are completely waterlogged from
rushing through thigh-high waters and many of you

00:13:32.947 --> 00:13:39.981
being submerged-- nearly drowned at times. You
gather yourself as you realize the threat is gone.

00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:45.077
The water elemental's destroyed, and this entity
that was once attacking you seems to have lowered

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:52.791
their trident and turned around, their attention
elsewhere, releasing any aggressive demeanor they

00:13:52.791 --> 00:14:01.465
have held since your arrival. At this time, you,
Beau, as you turn the corner and mashed the face

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:10.259
of Algar against the wet stone wall, you look over
to see both Fjord slice the hand off of his right wrist--

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:12.069
MARISHA: Wait, right or left?

00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:18.729
MATT: Oh, sorry, left hand. It's to your right.
You see the left hand get cut off. He screams out,

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:25.709
bleeding from the stump as he grabs it with his
other hand, the hand and the bracelet that was

00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:32.172
attached both clattering to the ground with a wet
thud and it (spinning), falling over to the side.

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:41.847
Beau, you also look over and notice there is this
horrible, strange, undead entity floating

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:50.124
immediately to your right of you and Algar, this
spectral creature that is ethereal, but made of

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:58.134
dark blue and black energy, this drowned spirit
that is giving off this horrible, guttural sucking

00:14:58.134 --> 00:15:05.416
sound and Fjord still stands there, blade in hand,
looming over the two of you, technically.

00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:09.522
LIAM: They're hidden from all the rest of our
views, right?

00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:14.998
MATT: Yeah, you guys know where they went, but you
have no idea what's transpired since. Currently,

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:20.499
Zsundie is floating towards the back of the
chamber, towards where they are. What do you do?

00:15:20.499 --> 00:15:26.177
MARISHA: Fjord, is he with you? I'm pointing at
the spectral guy.

00:15:26.177 --> 00:15:27.659
TRAVIS: He is.

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:30.979
MARISHA: So I shouldn't kill him?

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:38.370
TRAVIS: I don't think so. Might be unwise.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.304
MARISHA: You all right, man?

00:15:41.304 --> 00:15:46.060
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want that bracelet. I'll reach
down and pick it up.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.276
MATT: Okay. You pick the bracelet and Algar's
like, (groaning, pained panting).

00:15:50.276 --> 00:15:53.530
TRAVIS: I'll hold it in front of his face. You
used this to control that?

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.845
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.

00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:58.829
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm still holding him down.

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:02.344
TRAVIS: That's a 25.

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:11.433
MATT: "Yeah. It was part of my post. What are you
going to do? Please don't kill me. Please."

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:15.204
TRAVIS: Well, it depends on how forthcoming you
are. Anything I need to know to operate this thing

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:18.217
or I just slap it on and start giving commands?

00:16:18.217 --> 00:16:23.980
MATT: At this point, Zsundie appears at the back
of the chamber. Rounding the corner, the large,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:36.327
thick, barrel-chested, fish-like form wearing this
very well-tailored vest with the silks of the

00:16:36.327 --> 00:16:43.743
shirt billowing around its wet elemental form, its
fish face curled into this sly grin. It spins

00:16:43.743 --> 00:16:56.830
around and looks towards Algar and you guys. It
says, with this low, burbling fish voice, "Ah. I

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:07.414
"see the hour is nigh for vengeance." It pulls the
collar from its neck and it clangs onto the ground.

00:17:07.814 --> 00:17:12.384
(uncertain noises)

00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:14.373
SAM: Ask him to put it back on!

00:17:14.373 --> 00:17:17.122
LIAM: I'm going to start covering distance.

00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:19.990
TRAVIS: Indeed. The hour is nigh.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:32.935
MATT: It puts out its hand. "You have seemingly
come to the aid of this humble individual. Please,

00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:36.215
"hand me the implements of my enslavement."

00:17:36.215 --> 00:17:41.342
TRAVIS: May I ask how you came to be enslaved in
this predicament in the first place?

00:17:41.342 --> 00:17:43.644
MATT: "That is not of your concern."

00:17:43.644 --> 00:17:46.850
TRAVIS: How about an answer for the bracelet?

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:52.138
MATT: Algar's still "(moaning). Don't trust him!"

00:17:52.138 --> 00:17:53.344
MARISHA: I punch him.

00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:54.814
TRAVIS: That's right you do!

00:17:54.814 --> 00:17:56.099
MARISHA: Shut up.

00:17:56.099 --> 00:18:00.033
MATT: The rest of you are closing up on this
space.

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:02.433
TALIESIN: We're making our way there.

00:18:02.433 --> 00:18:08.254
MATT: You guys leap up and begin to climb. In the
meantime, the creature looks to you and says,

00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:20.958
"Let's just say that there were powerful minds
that were interested in the benefits of my

00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:25.133
"undivided attention towards things that were of
not my interest."

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:31.646
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to hear that. I never like to
see a creature put under the boot of somebody else

00:18:31.646 --> 00:18:35.246
for their gain. I'll toss him the bracelet.

00:18:35.246 --> 00:18:44.123
MATT: Catches it, picks up the necklace, and both
of them get tucked inside of its vest with this

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:58.460
heavy, wet sucking sound. Looks over to Algar. "It
would appear that you have this taken care of, but

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.395
would you do me the honors?"

00:19:00.395 --> 00:19:04.036
MARISHA: Well...

00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:08.962
TRAVIS: Actually, if you wouldn't mind, we have
further need--

00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:16.386
MARISHA: Questions, yeah. Just a conversation,
maybe, first. Can you wait five minutes?

00:19:16.386 --> 00:19:21.914
TRAVIS: Not even five minutes. Perhaps if he can
tell us the safe way out of here in exchange for

00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:27.347
letting us have our way with Algar, he could be on
his way and we can have our time.

00:19:27.347 --> 00:19:32.434
MARISHA: I'm confused on the levels on what you're
talking about what all you want, but I'm with it.

00:19:32.434 --> 00:19:36.476
Wait, do we do need from Algar--?

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:38.232
TRAVIS: But I don't want to kill Algar.

00:19:38.232 --> 00:19:39.517
MARISHA: You do want to kill Algar?

00:19:39.517 --> 00:19:40.384
TRAVIS: I do not. Nope.

00:19:40.384 --> 00:19:43.108
MARISHA: You don't want to kill Algar. Yeah.
Okay.

00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:47.003
TRAVIS: Hand up, one sec. Yeah, I'm saying: Don't
kill Algar.

00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:50.777
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll give earmuffs to Algar. Still
have my knee in his face.

00:19:50.777 --> 00:19:53.305
MATT: He's bleeding out.

00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:56.570
TRAVIS: I want to know if there's other booby
traps.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.956
LIAM: We're all watching?

00:19:57.956 --> 00:20:00.651
MATT: Yeah, you guys all now have gone into the
chamber. You can see this.

00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:05.784
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to do that thing I've
seen Beauregard do so many times and foof up my

00:20:05.784 --> 00:20:08.631
biceps and look intimidating.

00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:10.719
MARISHA: What do we do with Algar?

00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:12.185
TRAVIS: I'm not sure yet.

00:20:12.185 --> 00:20:17.667
MARISHA: By the way? I think Algar's unconscious.
He might be dead.

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:18.530
TRAVIS: Algar?

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.349
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:21.162
TRAVIS: I'll give him a little cheek slap.

00:20:21.162 --> 00:20:25.865
MATT: He's definitely passed out. He's not dead,
but there is a large amount of blood coming out of

00:20:25.865 --> 00:20:28.119
his severed stump.

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:32.700
LAURA: I stand next to Caleb and poke his biceps.
Ooh!

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.611
SAM: Guys need any help?

00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:36.286
MARISHA: Should we--

00:20:36.286 --> 00:20:40.989
TRAVIS: I'll tear off a sheet of ribbon off of my
sleeve and I'll wrap it around his forearm like a

00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:42.207
tight tourniquet.

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:44.472
MATT: Make a medicine check.

00:20:44.472 --> 00:20:48.679
LAURA: Do you want me to stabilize him? I can do
that.

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:52.411
TRAVIS: 11.

00:20:52.411 --> 00:20:57.516
MATT: That's enough to stabilize, okay. You've
prevented him from bleeding out. He looks pale and

00:20:57.734 --> 00:21:06.072
has lost a lot of blood and there is this dark
pool that's still suffusing the space around him

00:21:06.072 --> 00:21:13.226
on the stone floor on the raised area of the
hallway. So he's stable. Zsundie, as the rest of

00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:21.989
you came around the corner, you can see him
standing there looking at the group. "Well, I have

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:34.596
things to take care of now." It looks to you.
"Ketiv Zsundie is my title. I've been held here

00:21:34.596 --> 00:21:42.302
"for too long. Should you find yourself among the
endless seas of my world, come to my Silversilt Palace."

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:43.813
TRAVIS: Silversilt?

00:21:43.813 --> 00:21:50.740
MATT: "There I shall reward you for your
assistance. Now, I'll go to free my partner."

00:21:50.740 --> 00:22:01.723
MARISHA: Hey, Zsundie, real quick? Just seems like
you were powering the entire city. How would we do

00:22:01.723 --> 00:22:03.739
that without you?

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.720
MATT: "That's a good question," and it leaves.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.161
LAURA: What was the palace, what did he say?

00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:12.066
ALL: Silversilt.

00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:14.259
LAURA: Where was the palace, is it in the ocean?

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:16.071
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure--

00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:17.737
LAURA: Was it in the ocean?

00:22:17.737 --> 00:22:19.782
SAM: It's probably not on land, yeah.

00:22:19.782 --> 00:22:25.265
TALIESIN: Is everybody okay by the way do we have
every-- Oh god! I'm going to cast Turn Undead.

00:22:25.265 --> 00:22:25.988
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:22:25.988 --> 00:22:27.196
MATT: Okay.

00:22:27.196 --> 00:22:28.508
MARISHA: To the guy?

00:22:28.508 --> 00:22:30.128
LIAM: Yeah.

00:22:30.128 --> 00:22:35.652
MATT: That is a 14, what's your DC?

00:22:35.652 --> 00:22:37.528
TALIESIN: DC on Turn Undead? Let me find it
again--

00:22:37.528 --> 00:22:39.793
MATT: What's your spell DC?

00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:43.110
TALIESIN: Spell DC is 16.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:48.413
MATT: The specter goes (groaning) and immediately
turns around and starts drifting down the hallway

00:22:48.413 --> 00:22:52.223
away from you, giving this horrible hollow sucking
scream.

00:22:52.223 --> 00:22:53.555
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:55.509
MARISHA: Did we need him? Was he useful, too?

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:58.046
TRAVIS: Nope, no. I just forgot he was there.

00:22:58.046 --> 00:23:00.275
TALIESIN: All right, let's--

00:23:00.275 --> 00:23:02.315
SAM: Good job, Mr. Clay.

00:23:02.315 --> 00:23:05.010
TALISIN: If everyone's got a minute, does anybody
need healing?

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.877
TRAVIS: Actually, Algar might need a quick--

00:23:06.877 --> 00:23:08.187
LAURA: I have a question.

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:09.702
TALIESIN: I'm going to start a ten minute--

00:23:09.702 --> 00:23:10.901
LAURA: Are we going to kill him?

00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:11.924
TRAVIS: No!

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:16.895
LAURA: Well, if we don't, how do we get away
without anyone knowing that we killed his guards

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:19.101
and we let the guy go?

00:23:19.101 --> 00:23:21.403
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:23:21.403 --> 00:23:25.116
SAM: What do you mean? Just tell him: don't tell
anyone or we'll come back and kill you.

00:23:25.622 --> 00:23:26.251
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:28.725
LAURA: What if he goes in to like a protection
service or something?

00:23:28.725 --> 00:23:34.591
SAM: We need to have a conversation with him
afterwards. We can tell him to leave the city and

00:23:34.591 --> 00:23:38.003
never come back or we'll take off your other
hand!

00:23:38.003 --> 00:23:42.550
TRAVIS: I like that. Plus, they're guards, it's
their duty to fight, which they did and we

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.396
defended ourselves.

00:23:44.396 --> 00:23:45.442
LAURA: That's true.

00:23:45.442 --> 00:23:46.712
TRAVIS: I feel like--

00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:49.835
LAURA: I mean, we weren't even going to attack if
he hadn't attacked us in the first place.

00:23:49.835 --> 00:23:55.143
LIAM: Although, to play devil's advocate, you are
right: he could change his mind down the line and

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:57.048
try to get revenge on you or your mother.

00:23:57.048 --> 00:23:59.486
LAURA: I don't want him to get revenge on my
mother.

00:23:59.486 --> 00:24:01.583
TRAVIS: We'll make it pretty quick.

00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:04.562
MARISHA: We can do other things to make sure--

00:24:04.562 --> 00:24:09.041
LAURA: Can we make it seem like Algar was the one
who did all this?

00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.134
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:24:11.134 --> 00:24:13.833
LAURA: Like maybe he turned--

00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:16.717
SAM: Did he see you, does he know who you are?

00:24:16.717 --> 00:24:17.884
LAURA: No?

00:24:17.884 --> 00:24:24.292
SAM: Then why would connect anything to his
mother? Unless we tell him. To your mother, I mean.

00:24:24.307 --> 00:24:31.969
LAURA: Well, because I heard Tracy say that she
was staying at the fancy-- the Lavish Chateau.

00:24:31.969 --> 00:24:36.603
SAM: It's a hotel that lots of Tracys I think
probably stay at.

00:24:36.603 --> 00:24:39.025
TRAVIS: If we want to be really careful, there are
other places to stay.

00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:43.378
LIAM: I'm also curious to know what he is doing
down here in the first place.

00:24:43.378 --> 00:24:50.343
SAM: Why don't you step aside, so that he doesn't
see your face when he wakes up, or disguise your

00:24:50.343 --> 00:24:51.370
face so he hasn't--

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.940
LAURA: Oh, good call.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:59.208
LIAM: I would like to throw my hat in the ring to
say that I think he might need to die here, <i>ja</i>.

00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:04.107
SAM: Okay, so we got two kills, four maybes.

00:25:04.107 --> 00:25:09.760
LAURA: What if we send him out to sea? Don't
necessarily kill him, but make him leave and then

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.797
make it seem like he was the one that did
everything.

00:25:12.797 --> 00:25:16.885
TRAVIS: I think we're going to listen to your
influence on this one, Jester; it is closest to you.

00:25:17.287 --> 00:25:27.889
MARISHA: We do have one passage secured with
Captain Adella. We could just tell Edér-- what's

00:25:27.889 --> 00:25:36.864
his name? Algar. That's Pillars of Eternity. We
could just tell Algar: You have a new plot in

00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:40.770
life now and it's going to be to help Captain
Adella.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.106
SAM: Wait, is Yasha going with Adella? No.

00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:44.709
TRAVIS: No.

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:46.551
SAM: She's on a different boat, maybe.

00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:48.509
MATT: Yasha's with you.

00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:51.929
SAM: No, I know but she's going to be leaving at
some point soon, right?

00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:55.887
MATT: She was making her way towards the sea, but
hasn't made passage anywhere.

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:59.834
TRAVIS: No hard plans. Well, let's wake up this
son of a bitch.

00:25:59.834 --> 00:26:01.478
SAM: We can always kill him.

00:26:01.478 --> 00:26:02.636
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll get answers.

00:26:02.636 --> 00:26:04.048
LAURA: Worst case scenario, we kill him.

00:26:04.048 --> 00:26:05.939
SAM: Maybe best case scenario, yes.

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:08.133
LIAM: Just put a pin in it and see what we find
out here.

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.616
MARISHA: Do you want to disguise yourself, before
we do this?

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:18.072
LAURA: Oh, okay, yes. I will disguise myself as a
tortle, but not the that guy we met, like a tortle

00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:19.783
that's a girl.

00:26:19.783 --> 00:26:21.325
MATT: Okay.

00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:23.142
LIAM: Period.

00:26:23.142 --> 00:26:24.968
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it.

00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:26.836
MATT: I like that, a gortle.

00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:28.887
SAM: So exactly the same as the guy, except long
hair.

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:33.011
LAURA: No, no hair, but, like, a skirt.

00:26:33.011 --> 00:26:36.116
MATT: There you go. Tortle Skirts.

00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:39.340
LAURA: Because girls wear skirts, obviously,
that's what girls do.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.455
MATT: Jester needs to get out more.

00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:43.334
LIAM: Tortles wear skorts.

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:45.335
TALIESIN: At some point there's going to be a
healing spell.

00:26:45.335 --> 00:26:52.847
MARISHA: I get back on top of Algar and I'm
restraining him, pinning him down.

00:26:52.847 --> 00:26:55.707
TALIESIN: Does anybody not need healing?

00:26:55.707 --> 00:26:58.272
LIAM: Well, <i>Herr</i> Clay, do you need healing?

00:26:58.272 --> 00:26:59.182
SAM: I don't.

00:26:59.182 --> 00:27:00.922
MARISHA: I could use some healing.

00:27:00.922 --> 00:27:02.193
LIAM: Yeah, what about yourself?

00:27:02.193 --> 00:27:03.785
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm getting in on this.

00:27:03.785 --> 00:27:07.127
LIAM: I could use some, I don't know if you are
sharing?

00:27:07.127 --> 00:27:08.891
LAURA: You could do a Prayer of Healing.

00:27:08.891 --> 00:27:11.221
TALIESIN: That was what I've been doing, a Prayer
of Healing.

00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:14.018
LAURA: Oh really? We could both do Prayers of
Healing.

00:27:14.018 --> 00:27:19.417
TALIESIN: All right, so I'm doing everybody except
Nott, and I'm adding Algar to this.

00:27:19.417 --> 00:27:20.112
MATT: Okay.

00:27:20.112 --> 00:27:22.843
LAURA: I'm going to say I'm doing it, too, but I'm
not really going to.

00:27:22.843 --> 00:27:26.476
LIAM: On the count of three. One, two--

00:27:26.476 --> 00:27:29.813
TALIESIN: That's 14 points to everybody.

00:27:29.813 --> 00:27:33.499
LAURA: Dear Traveler, please heal everyone. Do you
guys feel better?

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:36.497
MARISHA: I do actually, thank you. How many
points?

00:27:36.497 --> 00:27:37.301
TALIESIN: 14.

00:27:37.301 --> 00:27:39.131
SAM: Thanks Mr. Clay and Jester.

00:27:39.131 --> 00:27:40.970
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:49.686
MATT: As the wave of healing divine energy
emanates from Clay's focused point, Algar who's

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:54.920
still being held against the wall by Beau,
(gasping)

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:01.223
TRAVIS: I'll bring the tip of the falchion right
under his chin. You know, before we begin, we got

00:28:01.223 --> 00:28:06.476
this thing about calling out, yelling, really
sensitive eardrums, so let's not do that.

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:13.942
MARISHA: Also, before we begin, I want to make
sure that you know how serious we are in getting

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:19.103
honesty from you. I take his head and I go
whack-whack into the wall.

00:28:19.103 --> 00:28:20.508
TRAVIS: Back unconscious!

00:28:20.508 --> 00:28:25.166
MARISHA: I'm going to do Extort Truth on him,
spend a ki point.

00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:26.774
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:28:26.774 --> 00:28:29.252
MARISHA: He has to make a charisma saving throw.

00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:31.262
MATT: That is 14.

00:28:31.262 --> 00:28:34.554
MARISHA: 14 is the DC.

00:28:34.554 --> 00:28:35.908
MATT: Okay, so he succeeds.

00:28:35.908 --> 00:28:37.853
MARISHA: Fucking fuck!

00:28:37.853 --> 00:28:39.529
MATT: You can try it again if you have another ki
point.

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:40.206
MARISHA: I do.

00:28:40.206 --> 00:28:45.223
MATT: Oh wait, no, let me see, I think he might be
immune to it for the next 24 hours based on the ability.

00:28:45.243 --> 00:28:46.350
MARISHA: What, to mine?

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.099
MATT: If he succeeds on it, yeah. I think so.

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:52.902
MARISHA: Well then, I go: I don't think you heard
me. Whack-whack, and I'll try one more time.

00:28:52.902 --> 00:28:57.248
MATT: Well, I'm going to double check here, but I
think if he succeeds in the save he's immune to it

00:28:57.248 --> 00:29:00.533
for 24 hours. I could be wrong. Let me double
check here.

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:02.569
SAM: Has it been 24 hours yet?

00:29:02.569 --> 00:29:05.670
MATT: Yeah, you can wait 24 hours and then come
back to it.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.636
LIAM: Let's just sit here until it's Crash Pandas
tomorrow.

00:29:07.636 --> 00:29:10.199
TRAVIS: I'll lean over to Nott and say: Nott, do
me a favor and make sure he's not carrying

00:29:10.199 --> 00:29:12.297
anything fancy in his pockets.

00:29:12.297 --> 00:29:17.297
SAM: I'm going to rifle through all of his pockets
with lightning speed agility of hand.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:19.231
MATT: Make an investigation check, please.

00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:23.470
SAM: Mm, not good. 12.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:38.709
MATT: 12, okay. Rifling through his bits, you find
21 gold pieces, 45 silver pieces, two platinum pieces.

00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:41.904
SAM: Great.

00:29:41.904 --> 00:29:51.697
MATT: You find one empty glass vial, where a
healing potion was used previously. A dagger, and

00:29:51.697 --> 00:29:59.429
a basic hand crossbow with five bolts.

00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:07.027
SAM: All right, I'll take the gold and the bolts,
and everything else I'll throw in a puddle.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.762
MATT: Perfect.

00:30:08.762 --> 00:30:10.170
LAURA: Does he have any pretty buttons?

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.060
SAM: Does he have any pretty buttons, Matthew?

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.459
MATT: He does, attached to the shirt, if you want
to pluck them.

00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:20.638
SAM: I will pluck the buttons.

00:30:20.638 --> 00:30:22.078
MATT: There are six buttons.

00:30:22.078 --> 00:30:23.864
SAM: Do I have to roll for each one?

00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:29.886
MATT: No, you're fine. To Extort Truth, no, you
can continue to try it if you want to.

00:30:29.886 --> 00:30:31.013
MARISHA: I try it again.

00:30:31.013 --> 00:30:31.974
LIAM: Spam it.

00:30:31.974 --> 00:30:33.458
MARISHA: Whack, whack.

00:30:33.458 --> 00:30:40.066
MATT: All right. With every more button pulled:
(smack) Button. (smack) Button. You're teaming up

00:30:40.066 --> 00:30:40.763
on this regard.

00:30:40.763 --> 00:30:42.245
MARISHA: Real serious.

00:30:42.245 --> 00:30:49.162
MATT: Okay, that's a failure. That's a natural
ten. Okay, you slam his head two more times and

00:30:49.162 --> 00:30:56.603
pinch an area underneath the bottom of the jaw. It
causes his irises to swell for a little bit. He

00:30:56.603 --> 00:30:59.496
looks towards you, head lolling a little bit.

00:30:59.496 --> 00:31:05.440
MARISHA: Now, you're going to answer all these
nice man's questions, okay?

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.969
MATT: He doesn't answer, but you have his
attention.

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:16.320
TRAVIS: What was your job down here, and why were
you giving commands to that creature with this bracelet?

00:31:18.292 --> 00:31:25.614
MATT: "It's my job. I was assigned as the
supervisor of the Sluice Gate."

00:31:25.614 --> 00:31:28.316
TRAVIS: Who do you report to?

00:31:28.316 --> 00:31:38.409
MATT: "I report to the Clovis Concord. I was
assigned here maybe a few months back from Port

00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:48.287
"Zoon, but I largely, specifically, report to the
Marquis and his associates."

00:31:48.287 --> 00:31:49.459
TRAVIS: Marquis...

00:31:49.459 --> 00:31:52.612
MARISHA: The Marquis, the...

00:31:52.612 --> 00:31:55.417
MATT: "Marquis Ze Fuldan."

00:31:55.417 --> 00:31:58.174
MARISHA: Oh, that guy, right? Lives in the palace
guy?

00:31:58.174 --> 00:32:00.488
TRAVIS: Yeah, not LePual.

00:32:00.488 --> 00:32:01.410
MATT: No.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.364
TRAVIS: Demesne.

00:32:03.364 --> 00:32:13.960
LIAM: Fjord, ask him if knowledge of that water
creature that was here and is gone now, if that is

00:32:14.253 --> 00:32:16.714
known all the way to the top, or is it his bag,
or--

00:32:16.714 --> 00:32:23.031
TRAVIS: The creature that was here and the magic
used to control him, is that something that you

00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:28.856
brought to the table, or was that a device given
to you and known in the higher ranks of government?

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.360
MATT: He's resisting answering.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.298
MARISHA: I dig that finger into his pressure point
a little harder.

00:32:41.298 --> 00:32:47.191
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage
because you have him affected with the Extort--

00:32:47.191 --> 00:32:49.565
MARISHA: Oh, right, charisma. 11.

00:32:49.565 --> 00:32:58.530
MATT: In his current position, he
"(grunting) The Margrave and the Concord are

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:06.590
"aware. This is one of two cities that runs with
one of these marid underneath. (grunts)"

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.401
TRAVIS: One of two cities?

00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:10.156
MATT: "Yes."

00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:11.276
TRAVIS: And the other would be?

00:33:11.276 --> 00:33:12.699
MATT: "Port Damali."

00:33:14.809 --> 00:33:22.916
TRAVIS: Right. What else do you do here in
Nicodranas? What do you do to pass the time,

00:33:23.141 --> 00:33:28.442
Algar? I'm trying to decide whether or not to hand
you over to this fearsome beast over here, and I

00:33:28.442 --> 00:33:30.610
point to (laughing) Caleb.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.724
MATT: With the muscles popping?

00:33:33.724 --> 00:33:41.213
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, and I send Frumpkin, who's holding his
breath schlooping up on top of his chest. He's

00:33:41.213 --> 00:33:43.274
hungry, and so am I.

00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:47.565
(laughter)

00:33:47.565 --> 00:33:49.331
MARISHA: It puts the lotion on its skin.

00:33:49.331 --> 00:33:51.641
TRAVIS: I'll make you into a jacket.

00:33:51.641 --> 00:34:02.188
MATT: "I drink and carouse, buy fine linens and
furniture."

00:34:02.188 --> 00:34:09.138
LAURA: That's good hobbies.

00:34:09.138 --> 00:34:12.051
MATT: Yeah. You asked what he does with his spare
time.

00:34:12.051 --> 00:34:13.990
TRAVIS: You have any significant others in the
city?

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:30.424
MATT: "None, really. I take companions. The Ruby
is a very beautiful creature."

00:34:30.424 --> 00:34:31.711
LAURA: Woo, Ruby! She's real hot.

00:34:31.711 --> 00:34:37.931
(laughter)

00:34:37.931 --> 00:34:42.174
TRAVIS: Agreed. I think we all know The Ruby of
the Sea far and wide. Think she'd miss you if you

00:34:42.182 --> 00:34:44.035
went missing?

00:34:48.785 --> 00:34:54.159
MATT: "A few more weeks of wooing her, yes."

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.028
MARISHA: No, that's not how that shit works, man.

00:34:56.028 --> 00:34:56.736
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:34:58.511 --> 00:35:00.321
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:35:00.486 --> 00:35:06.311
MATT: There's a conflict inside where his
masculine pride immediately hits with the hit to

00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:08.672
his ego that you just delivered.

00:35:08.672 --> 00:35:12.609
TALIESIN: What were you doing down here?

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:14.679
MATT: "My job."

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:17.194
TALIESIN: What is your job, exactly?

00:35:17.194 --> 00:35:25.566
MATT: "To maintain the Weave. To help exert my
will on the creature that you just freed, so it

00:35:25.566 --> 00:35:31.389
"can direct water towards the various furnaces that
run a lot of the engines that help maintain some

00:35:31.389 --> 00:35:33.090
"of the commerce here in the city."

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.902
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, and what happens to the commerce in
the city now that you have fucked that up?

00:35:36.902 --> 00:35:47.253
MATT: "Oh, I fucked it up? Well, thanks to your
interference here, they're probably going to have

00:35:47.253 --> 00:35:54.190
"to re-network everything through analog means.
That'll take weeks. It'll be expensive."

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.599
LAURA: Oh man, you're going to be in so much
trouble.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:36:01.522
TALIESIN: Especially, I imagine, if they start
looking into everything you did with that kind of

00:36:01.522 --> 00:36:05.327
power. I mean, having access to that kind of
creature, I can't imagine that you were on the

00:36:05.327 --> 00:36:07.073
up-and-up about everything you did.

00:36:07.073 --> 00:36:10.627
TRAVIS: Especially if you start to admit that you
did it all yourself. I'll use Mask of Many Faces

00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:12.071
to look just like him.

00:36:12.071 --> 00:36:16.018
TALIESIN: People have got to have to start asking
questions, serious questions.

00:36:16.018 --> 00:36:23.106
MATT: You hear his head hit the stone once more.
"Who the fuck are you?"

00:36:23.106 --> 00:36:25.041
TRAVIS: (as Algar) Who the fuck are you?

00:36:25.041 --> 00:36:28.051
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.

00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:30.922
MARISHA: So badass!

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.527
TRAVIS: 19.

00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:42.410
MATT: He looks down at his severed hand, the stump
having now healed over from the healing power of

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:50.189
your prayer. "Look, please, I don't want to die. I
don't want to die down here. I don't want to wash

00:36:50.189 --> 00:36:51.852
up in the middle of the shore."

00:36:51.852 --> 00:36:56.701
TRAVIS: You know what I'm feeling like, Beau? That
I just need to get out of this city and never come

00:36:56.701 --> 00:37:01.881
back, go somewhere far away. I hold up also a
stump, because my hand is missing. I need to go,

00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:03.685
in a boat, and just go.

00:37:03.685 --> 00:37:07.608
MARISHA: Man, that sounds like a fine idea, Algar,
doesn't it?

00:37:07.608 --> 00:37:13.068
LIAM: Frumpkin starts to lovingly gnaw with his
beak on the upper chin of Algar.

00:37:13.068 --> 00:37:15.168
MATT: "That sounds like a great idea."

00:37:15.168 --> 00:37:18.822
TRAVIS: Maybe a haircut, maybe a new name, too.
What do you think?

00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:21.606
MARISHA: Oh, man. You look like a Jorge.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:26.719
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up the severed hand
and start casting Decompose on it, too.

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:35.688
SAM: I'm going to start backing up, shaking my
head. You people are fucked up!

00:37:35.688 --> 00:37:47.164
MATT: He nods. "Right, yeah, I'll go. I'll leave
immediately. Just please let me go."

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:52.841
TRAVIS: All depends on how we decide to act as we
get out of here. I'm sure you know a very safe way

00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:54.451
to the surface, yes?

00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:59.076
MATT: "Same way I come in every day. Yeah, I'll
show you out."

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:01.327
TRAVIS: Shall we?

00:38:01.327 --> 00:38:04.159
LAURA: What do we do with him so nobody sees him?

00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:08.607
SAM: Must have a bag or something.

00:38:08.607 --> 00:38:13.939
TRAVIS: Just walk out with handless, bagged man?

00:38:13.939 --> 00:38:16.359
LAURA: Hey, Yasha, what's in your bag you've been
carrying?

00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:22.098
MATT: It's not on her; it's up in the boat you
guys had put in the water. She goes, "Mostly just

00:38:22.098 --> 00:38:25.701
"blankets and gold."

00:38:25.701 --> 00:38:27.209
LIAM: I have a cloak.

00:38:27.209 --> 00:38:32.031
SAM: Yeah, we can wrap him up in a cloak and carry
him out like we're carrying some equipment.

00:38:32.031 --> 00:38:37.440
LAURA: Okay. I mean, (southern accent) Oh, all
right. (whispering) Shit, I forgot to do the

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.230
voice. How do you remember to do that all the
time?

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.887
SAM: He doesn't, sometimes.

00:38:45.377 --> 00:38:52.296
MARISHA: Algar, you're going to be very helpful
when it comes to making sure Algar knows who to

00:38:52.528 --> 00:38:54.789
talk to and the right things to say to get us out,
right?

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:56.193
MATT: "Right."

00:38:56.193 --> 00:38:57.948
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, Jorge.

00:38:57.948 --> 00:39:06.396
MATT: "Jorge." He's still trying to pull away from
the horrible, slow sucking of--

00:39:06.396 --> 00:39:08.300
LIAM: No, it's a beak.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.519
MATT: Oh, the tentacles wrapping around the neck,
and there's a slight biting right there.

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:20.677
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my disguise kit and
give him a nice little beard and a mustache. And

00:39:20.677 --> 00:39:21.962
an eye patch.

00:39:21.962 --> 00:39:27.375
MATT: He sits there, held to the wall, being
chewed on by a tiny octopus, for the next 30

00:39:27.375 --> 00:39:33.172
minutes, while you roll-- Okay, roll for your
disguise kit.

00:39:33.172 --> 00:39:37.501
LAURA: I'm proficient with disguise, so I roll
with advantage, because I'm--?

00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:43.191
MATT: Not with advantage, but you get proficiency
bonus, so roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

00:39:45.506 --> 00:39:47.892
LAURA: Plus proficiency, 20.

00:39:47.892 --> 00:39:55.230
MATT: Algar looks like a weirder uncle of Algar
who could probably pass for a Jorge, sure, yeah.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:40:00.603
But he looks different, and is missing a hand, so
it's definitely not Algar.

00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:08.037
TRAVIS: Jorge, any traps, contraptions we should
be aware of as we're heading out?

00:40:08.037 --> 00:40:16.087
MATT: "No, no traps. There are some lockdown
failsafes, but it's not much help at the moment."

00:40:16.087 --> 00:40:22.535
TRAVIS: How far away is the other container for
the other, I assume, creature under the same

00:40:22.535 --> 00:40:27.922
restraints we saw here? He mentioned going to free
his compatriot?

00:40:27.922 --> 00:40:30.632
LAURA: His partner in Port Damali, Fjord.

00:40:30.632 --> 00:40:33.388
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought there were two under
Nicodranas.

00:40:33.388 --> 00:40:36.094
LAURA: I bet it's his partner in Port Damali.

00:40:36.094 --> 00:40:41.045
MATT: He gives you a look that doesn't nod, but
you can see from his recognition that you hit the

00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:43.597
nail on the head.

00:40:43.597 --> 00:40:46.157
LAURA: See? The accent, it makes me smarter.

00:40:46.157 --> 00:40:50.960
TRAVIS: I was okay with the rolling blackouts in
Nicodranas, but two cities I feel a little worse

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.046
about. A little worse. They'll figure it out.

00:40:56.046 --> 00:40:58.056
MARISHA: The whole eastern seaboard is shut down.

00:40:58.056 --> 00:41:00.826
TRAVIS: There's a mage tower that goes up and
down. This place will be fine.

00:41:00.826 --> 00:41:05.278
TALIESIN: They're over-investing in genie-based
power systems.

00:41:05.278 --> 00:41:07.270
MARISHA: Technology, yeah!

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:10.002
TRAVIS: Well, Jorge, why don't you show us the way
out?

00:41:10.002 --> 00:41:14.759
MATT: He looks to Beau to be let up, because he's
still being pressed.

00:41:14.759 --> 00:41:20.690
MARISHA: Oh, I know, it's so obnoxious when
someone has their hands on you and you don't want

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.836
it, isn't it? Okay, let's go.

00:41:22.836 --> 00:41:25.641
(laughter)

00:41:25.641 --> 00:41:31.377
MATT: He gets up. (grunts) Still looking over the
missing hand and back at the rest of you, and

00:41:31.482 --> 00:41:36.699
begins to slump his way further down the hallway
where they were heading to exit. You're following

00:41:36.699 --> 00:41:44.954
him down this path. He's using a small torch that
he lit for light to make his way down here, and as

00:41:44.954 --> 00:41:49.063
he leads you through, it opens up into a few other
small chambers that have some tables and chairs.

00:41:49.063 --> 00:41:57.631
There's a number of weapons, close-quarter smaller
weapons for any combat that may take place in a

00:41:57.631 --> 00:42:09.662
tunnel. There's a small sketch with charcoal or
some sort of a darker chalk on the wall that

00:42:09.662 --> 00:42:15.660
outlines the layout of the Sluice Weave for those
that are coming in to see where they're trying to

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.857
go and get to.

00:42:16.857 --> 00:42:19.084
LIAM: I take a good long look at it.

00:42:19.084 --> 00:42:20.806
LAURA: I draw a dick on it.

00:42:20.806 --> 00:42:24.157
LIAM: Great, now I have to remember that as well.

00:42:24.157 --> 00:42:26.837
MATT: Yeah, yeah, you do. It's part of it now.

00:42:26.837 --> 00:42:29.121
TRAVIS: Pre-dick or post-dick?

00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:36.258
LIAM: It's in. Is it in?

00:42:36.258 --> 00:42:45.127
MATT: There you go. Eventually, he leads you to a
spiral staircase that goes upwards. There are two

00:42:45.127 --> 00:42:51.717
sets of iron barred doors he has the keys to. He
opens them, leads you in. You do notice on the way

00:42:51.717 --> 00:42:58.261
through there are a couple of archways leading
from chamber to chamber where there are gated

00:42:58.261 --> 00:43:05.047
portcullis doorways that would collapse down.
There are switches on the opposite side as a means

00:43:05.047 --> 00:43:12.996
of defense if things were to go wrong to back up.
Once you have them under your control, he has no

00:43:12.996 --> 00:43:17.801
means of doing so, and you watch him very
carefully. Heading up the spiral staircase, it

00:43:17.801 --> 00:43:25.270
leads you to a trap door that a stair leads up to.
He pushes it open quietly, and it leads you into a

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:35.768
small office. It's got a small desk, it's got a
stool, it's got some odd stacks of paper, looks

00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:40.918
like there's a quill and an inkwell, a second
unopened inkwell. There's some partially melted

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:45.848
candles that aren't lit at the moment, and there
is a door that exits. He unlocks that door.

00:43:45.848 --> 00:43:51.208
TRAVIS: Just a moment. We're going to need those
keys.

00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:54.088
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the ink, too.

00:43:54.088 --> 00:43:57.790
LIAM: And rifle through the papers on the desk.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:03.418
TRAVIS: Now, I'm sure it goes without saying that
once you leave this place, if you yell, or act a

00:44:03.486 --> 00:44:09.276
fool in any way, we will tear you asunder before
you can say "Ow."

00:44:09.276 --> 00:44:14.220
MATT: "I understand."

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.729
LIAM: Do you still look like him?

00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:16.432
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:16.432 --> 00:44:19.252
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. Is this your office?

00:44:19.252 --> 00:44:21.045
MATT: "This is my office, yeah."

00:44:21.045 --> 00:44:23.215
LAURA: These people will know this is your
office?

00:44:23.215 --> 00:44:25.434
MATT: "The few that I work with, yes."

00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:28.478
LAURA: Got it. Thank you. (southern accent) I
mean, got it, thank you.

00:44:28.478 --> 00:44:32.284
SAM: Caleb, did you find anything?

00:44:32.284 --> 00:44:34.861
LIAM: I don't know, did I find anything?

00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:36.602
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:44:36.602 --> 00:44:42.040
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay. Ooh, ten.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:51.049
MATT: You glance through quickly. A lot of it
appears to be notes on repairs, on how best to

00:44:51.456 --> 00:44:56.799
organize the time that the marid has. There is an
actual breakdown on how often it can summon

00:44:56.799 --> 00:45:02.959
elementals and control them. You find some things
that talk about a marid defense of the city,

00:45:02.959 --> 00:45:09.260
meaning there is a plan in place that if ever the
city were under attack from the sea, that it was

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:15.051
one of their secret weapons to defend the city
from ships. That's the most you can find. Those

00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:19.309
are all surface things that you see on the desk.
The rest of it doesn't seem to make much sense or

00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:21.369
pertain to anything important to you.

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:22.731
LAURA: Jorge. Sorry.

00:45:22.731 --> 00:45:24.209
TALIESIN: Go ahead. No.

00:45:24.209 --> 00:45:27.747
LAURA: Are any of these-- (southern accent) Are
any of these letters written by you?

00:45:27.747 --> 00:45:32.027
MATT: "A few of them." He points to a couple.

00:45:32.027 --> 00:45:35.735
LAURA: I'm going to take one and study it.

00:45:35.735 --> 00:45:38.053
LIAM: Are you right-handed or left-handed?

00:45:38.053 --> 00:45:40.433
MARISHA: Well, now he's right-handed.

00:45:40.433 --> 00:45:45.859
LIAM: But two hours ago, were you right-handed or
left-handed?

00:45:45.859 --> 00:45:47.995
MATT: "I was left-handed."

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:48.797
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:45:48.797 --> 00:45:50.190
TRAVIS: That's a bitch.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.542
SAM: He'll never play piano.

00:45:51.542 --> 00:45:53.509
LAURA: Hey, I'm left-handed.

00:45:53.509 --> 00:45:59.795
TALIESIN: I'm looking for anywhere where there
might be a secret stash or something that looks

00:45:59.795 --> 00:46:04.231
off-kilter or a little odd in here, somewhere
where he might be hiding something.

00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:06.277
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:46:11.027 --> 00:46:12.931
TALIESIN: Six. No.

00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:14.327
MATT: Looks like an office.

00:46:14.327 --> 00:46:23.431
TRAVIS: What do you guys think? I feel like I need
to partake on this voyage <i>today</i>. Don't you think?

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.993
MARISHA: Hmm.

00:46:24.993 --> 00:46:30.140
TRAVIS: Almost ASAFP? Right?

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.208
MARISHA: The weather's kind.

00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:34.659
TRAVIS: It was a nice day earlier.

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:36.181
MARISHA: Seize the moment.

00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:39.340
LAURA: Walk him out and make sure that he gets on
the boat?

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.465
TRAVIS: You want to do that?

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:45.917
LAURA: Well, I got to write some shit in this
office, but it's up to y'all.

00:46:45.917 --> 00:46:49.740
SAM: Maybe Beau and myself could go?

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:59.326
MARISHA: Maybe our tortle friend here can leave a
little note in your stead, says that you're moving on.

00:47:00.824 --> 00:47:02.556
MATT: "That's fine."

00:47:02.556 --> 00:47:08.546
MARISHA: Are there any favorite buzzwords of
yours? Something that would sound like you?

00:47:08.546 --> 00:47:10.066
SAM: How do you normally sign letters?

00:47:10.066 --> 00:47:14.326
MARISHA: (laughing) A lodestar.

00:47:14.326 --> 00:47:19.108
SAM: Are you a "Sincerely" person, or a "Love,"
"Love, Algar?"

00:47:19.108 --> 00:47:25.208
MATT: His stare is far off in the distance. He is
looking down the barrel of a gun and a complete

00:47:25.208 --> 00:47:29.678
shift in his life that he wasn't expecting to take
immediately. His responses are very one-word and

00:47:29.678 --> 00:47:31.287
very, "No."

00:47:31.287 --> 00:47:34.050
TRAVIS: Shouldn't have been a dick.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.248
SAM: Well, all right. I'm sure it's probably a
"Sincerely."

00:47:38.248 --> 00:47:44.241
LIAM: It's very sad. So sad that he had to sit
down and write a letter about how he had to leave

00:47:44.241 --> 00:47:48.818
the city and how he had to free the creature
beneath the city because it was so wrong--

00:47:48.818 --> 00:47:51.999
LAURA: Don't tell him all those things. I totally
plan on doing that shit. Get out of here before

00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:52.877
talking about--

00:47:52.877 --> 00:47:54.515
LIAM: He's leaving.

00:47:54.515 --> 00:47:57.521
LAURA: (teeth clenched) Get out!

00:47:57.521 --> 00:48:00.706
MARISHA: Okay, we'll go. We'll meet up with you
guys?

00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:03.513
LAURA: Yeah, we'll see you back at the (mumble).

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:05.472
SAM: Sure, tortle.

00:48:05.472 --> 00:48:18.817
MATT: You escort him to the wharf. As a sailor,
you know specifically who to talk to to secure

00:48:18.817 --> 00:48:26.544
passage under the table. Where do you want to send
him?

00:48:26.544 --> 00:48:32.552
SAM: I don't know anything about the outside
world. Where's far?

00:48:33.133 --> 00:48:34.188
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:48:34.188 --> 00:48:35.138
TRAVIS: Where?

00:48:35.138 --> 00:48:37.329
LIAM: I was joking, I said Glintshore.

00:48:37.329 --> 00:48:41.327
MATT: (laughs) It's a good summer stay-away.

00:48:41.327 --> 00:48:42.896
LIAM: Lay out on the glass.

00:48:42.896 --> 00:48:44.448
LAURA: Somewhere in Tal'Dorei.

00:48:44.448 --> 00:48:48.775
MARISHA: Yeah. Marquet is far. It's very far.

00:48:48.775 --> 00:48:51.374
SAM: I heard a traveler talking about Whitestone.

00:48:51.374 --> 00:48:52.897
TRAVIS: I don't think it has a shore.

00:48:52.897 --> 00:48:57.160
SAM: I don't know, I just heard about it. I don't
know anything about it.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:01.072
MARISHA: There's Stilben. Which was on the coast?

00:49:01.072 --> 00:49:05.507
MATT: Yeah, that's one of the major coastal cities
on the eastern side of Tal'Dorei.

00:49:05.507 --> 00:49:08.855
LIAM: I hear Opash has a sweet Airbnb on an
island.

00:49:08.855 --> 00:49:09.879
TRAVIS: Let's send him to Marquet.

00:49:09.879 --> 00:49:11.816
MARISHA: Marquet! Marquet it is.

00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:13.358
SAM: That's where Adella's going.

00:49:13.358 --> 00:49:15.006
TRAVIS: There you go.

00:49:15.006 --> 00:49:19.345
MATT: All right. Because it's a longer journey,
it's a little more expensive, but you can secure

00:49:19.345 --> 00:49:24.475
passage for him to Marquet for, we'll say, 20
gold.

00:49:24.475 --> 00:49:26.735
MARISHA: I'll sponsor that journey.

00:49:26.735 --> 00:49:27.938
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:49:27.938 --> 00:49:32.616
LAURA: Want to give him a little spending cash?
Make sure he's not completely destitute when he

00:49:32.616 --> 00:49:33.813
gets there.

00:49:33.813 --> 00:49:35.235
TALIESIN: That seems nice.

00:49:35.235 --> 00:49:37.164
MARISHA: Did we take the money that was on him?

00:49:37.164 --> 00:49:39.452
SAM: I may have taken the money that was on him.

00:49:39.452 --> 00:49:42.474
TRAVIS: You want to put back one of those
platinums?

00:49:42.474 --> 00:49:51.558
SAM: Sure. Here you go, Jorge. Here's one
platinum.

00:49:51.558 --> 00:49:54.193
MATT: "This is very kind of you."

00:49:54.193 --> 00:49:55.148
SAM: And five copper.

00:49:55.148 --> 00:50:00.363
(laughter)

00:50:00.363 --> 00:50:04.657
MATT: The beard's peeling a little bit. He's just
staring at the coin in his palm.

00:50:05.088 --> 00:50:07.221
TRAVIS: Let me get that part. (slap)

00:50:07.221 --> 00:50:09.345
MARISHA: God, we're mean.

00:50:09.345 --> 00:50:14.139
LAURA: He was a bad person. We didn't kill him.

00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:16.559
TALIESIN: No, you let him live. That's really
nice.

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:18.131
MARISHA: Thanks, Deuce.

00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:24.525
SAM: We're going to try and take him to Adella or
just any boat?

00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:25.507
TRAVIS: Any boat.

00:50:25.507 --> 00:50:32.466
MATT: Adella leaves in little under a week. You
can secure passage today on a small ship that's

00:50:32.466 --> 00:50:39.917
heading back to Marquet. You send him off on his
way. You wait another hour or so to make sure the

00:50:39.917 --> 00:50:49.440
ship disembarks and he doesn't abscond from the
ship itself. You watch as it begins to make its

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.655
way towards the horizon and you feel confident
that he's not going to be coming back anytime soon.

00:50:54.178 --> 00:50:58.534
TRAVIS: That ring of keys that he gave us:
approximately how many keys are on that thing?

00:50:58.534 --> 00:50:59.439
MATT: Eight.

00:50:59.439 --> 00:51:08.560
LAURA: I need to write a letter about-- okay, what
should I say? "I hate this city, I want everyone

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.594
"to suffer what I feel in my heart?"

00:51:11.594 --> 00:51:12.770
LIAM: "I'm sick of you people pushing me
around--"

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:19.159
LAURA: "I'm sick of all you people pushing me
around, I'm freeing this djinn and I'm setting

00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:22.936
sail for another land." How about all of that?

00:51:22.936 --> 00:51:30.184
TRAVIS: Yes. And, "I plan to betray all of the
city's secrets to your foes if I ever return.

00:51:30.506 --> 00:51:33.122
"It'll be very smart to kill me on sight."

00:51:33.122 --> 00:51:37.143
(laughter)

00:51:37.143 --> 00:51:38.392
LAURA: That's probably good.

00:51:38.392 --> 00:51:40.956
LIAM: It's maybe-- it's gilding the lily,
perhaps.

00:51:40.956 --> 00:51:47.818
LAURA: Okay, well. What if I just write "Ha ha ha,
I'm so glad you guys are going to suffer, I got

00:51:47.818 --> 00:51:49.796
"away scot free."

00:51:49.796 --> 00:51:54.086
LIAM: Lots of middle fingers, you'll never catch
me alive, your city is shit.

00:51:54.086 --> 00:51:58.534
SAM: "I'm going to burn all of my fellow guards
with a large Fireball first."

00:51:58.534 --> 00:52:02.159
(laughter)

00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:03.871
LIAM: We can take care of the guards.

00:52:03.871 --> 00:52:07.511
SAM: They're going find some charred bodies and
stuff--

00:52:07.511 --> 00:52:10.787
LAURA: If the djinn got away, then maybe the djinn
did it.

00:52:10.787 --> 00:52:12.563
LIAM: A water creature?

00:52:12.563 --> 00:52:15.978
SAM: How'd that fire happen, though?

00:52:15.978 --> 00:52:19.531
MATT: Here's a question. Did you dismiss your
specter, or do you have a--

00:52:19.531 --> 00:52:21.047
TRAVIS: I didn't dismiss it.

00:52:21.047 --> 00:52:23.021
MATT: As you guys are--

00:52:23.021 --> 00:52:25.598
MARISHA: It's just running around in terror.

00:52:25.598 --> 00:52:33.510
MATT: As you're leaving the area, right behind you
is this (ghostly groaning). What do you do with it?

00:52:33.888 --> 00:52:35.514
TRAVIS: You mean as we go outside outside?

00:52:35.514 --> 00:52:37.340
MATT: Yeah. It's following you.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.364
TRAVIS: Go back inside the room!

00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:45.893
MATT: You guys begin to watch as that same drowned
specter is now coming back behind you (groaning)

00:52:45.893 --> 00:52:48.267
TALIESIN: Oh god! I Turn Undead.

00:52:48.267 --> 00:52:51.214
MATT: It turns right around and runs off a bit.

00:52:51.214 --> 00:52:54.941
SAM: Wait. Turn Undead really just turns an undead
around?

00:52:54.941 --> 00:52:56.508
TALIESIN: Yes. It's Turn Undead.

00:52:56.508 --> 00:52:58.690
MATT: It's frightened of him and runs away.

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:01.167
LIAM: It's like a remote control car that spins.

00:53:01.167 --> 00:53:05.408
LAURA: Unless you're high enough level, and then
it (pop).

00:53:05.408 --> 00:53:08.720
TALIESIN: I'm not quite at the pop-it. It's too
strong for me to pop, right?

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.061
MATT: Correct. It doesn't last a long while. A
short time passes and it just--

00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:17.003
LAURA: So I'm writing this letter? And I'm leaving
it in his office, yeah?

00:53:17.003 --> 00:53:19.309
LIAM: Yeah we're still in the office, are we not?

00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:23.433
MARISHA: Technically <i>we</i> left. You three are
here.

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:27.278
LIAM: While Jester is writing, I would like to
flip this office for anything of value.

00:53:27.278 --> 00:53:28.972
MATT: You already have.

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.223
LIAM: Oh, just the papers?

00:53:30.223 --> 00:53:32.022
MATT: Well, you checked around for anything that
would be interesting, so--

00:53:32.022 --> 00:53:32.924
LIAM: Excellent.

00:53:32.924 --> 00:53:36.258
TALIESIN: Well, I have a thought.

00:53:36.258 --> 00:53:37.656
LAURA: What?

00:53:37.656 --> 00:53:43.996
TALIESIN: What if he accidentally lost control of
the creature and then ran--

00:53:43.996 --> 00:53:44.742
MATT: (groaning noises)

00:53:44.742 --> 00:53:46.664
TALIESIN: Ah! Turn Undead.

00:53:46.664 --> 00:53:48.062
(laughter)

00:53:48.062 --> 00:53:49.806
MATT: How many Channel Divinities can you do?

00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:53.276
TALIESIN: I might be out. I was about to say--
don't I have-- I might be out.

00:53:53.276 --> 00:54:00.322
MATT: I feel like you were out last time. We'll
say you took a short rest, but-- It's wandered

00:54:00.322 --> 00:54:03.509
back in the chamber and it's looking at Fjord.
(groaning)

00:54:03.509 --> 00:54:05.024
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I'm out.

00:54:05.024 --> 00:54:09.390
LAURA: Do we have two Channel Divinities or just
one at this level? Then I Turn Undead!

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:10.708
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:54:10.708 --> 00:54:14.213
MATT: Turns around and starts walking away.

00:54:14.213 --> 00:54:17.098
MARISHA: I really feel like you could do something
about this!

00:54:17.098 --> 00:54:21.419
TALIESIN: Maybe he ran away because doesn't want
to be held accountable for his actions?

00:54:21.419 --> 00:54:27.325
LAURA: Oh, that's true. What do you guys think?
Okay. Deuce has a really good idea. Maybe instead

00:54:27.325 --> 00:54:31.936
of we say, "Go fuck yourself," and all of that,
what if we say-- It's really strong, we have this

00:54:31.936 --> 00:54:34.295
version of his letter right here.

00:54:34.295 --> 00:54:35.233
LIAM: Draft number two.

00:54:35.233 --> 00:54:41.489
LAURA: Draft number two. "Oh no, I lost control of
the genie, and now I am so scared I'm running away."

00:54:42.116 --> 00:54:47.083
TALIESIN: He strikes me as the sort of person who
doesn't want to be held responsible--

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:49.552
LIAM: If you were fleeing in terror, would you
stop to write a letter?

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:55.143
TALIESIN: That might be his attempt to say, "I did
this, I'm sorry, bye" kind of thing.

00:54:55.143 --> 00:54:57.579
TRAVIS: Remember, we don't want anybody to like
him when he comes back.

00:54:57.579 --> 00:54:59.406
TALIESIN: Well, they're not, there are people dead
down there.

00:54:59.406 --> 00:55:02.306
MATT: (ghostly groaning) The specter returns as
you guys are having this conversation.

00:55:02.306 --> 00:55:06.214
LAURA: Ah! I can't do anything! I try to attack
it.

00:55:06.214 --> 00:55:08.960
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an attack
roll.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.374
LAURA: I'll Sacred Flame him.

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:12.725
MATT: Okay.

00:55:12.725 --> 00:55:16.116
MARISHA: Do you guys remember in Tomb Raider 2 the
butler that you had?

00:55:16.116 --> 00:55:18.565
MATT: That's 12, so it takes damage. That's
basically what this is!

00:55:18.565 --> 00:55:26.522
LAURA: Oh! That's 11. 11 radiant damage.

00:55:26.522 --> 00:55:32.348
MATT: 11 points of radiant damage. All right.
(impact, groaning)

00:55:32.348 --> 00:55:33.871
TALIESIN: Oh god, Sacred Flame.

00:55:33.871 --> 00:55:36.976
MATT: Success.

00:55:38.382 --> 00:55:39.937
TALIESIN: Three points.

00:55:39.937 --> 00:55:41.813
MATT: It's not attacking anyone.

00:55:41.813 --> 00:55:42.827
LAURA: Oh, it's not?

00:55:42.827 --> 00:55:46.124
MATT: It's not assaulting you guys. It's just
standing there and taking the hits and looking in

00:55:46.124 --> 00:55:51.278
pain. It keeps looking for Fjord.
(ghostly groaning)

00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:52.413
TRAVIS: You can go.

00:55:52.413 --> 00:55:57.001
MATT: It disperses into shadow and vanishes.

00:55:57.001 --> 00:55:58.383
MARISHA: We're time jumping.

00:55:58.383 --> 00:56:05.748
SAM: Me and Marisha are took Jorge to the docks
with the promise that Fjord would come later and

00:56:05.748 --> 00:56:06.442
join us.

00:56:06.442 --> 00:56:09.044
LIAM: But he was the one that had all the sailor
tricks to get the boat!

00:56:09.044 --> 00:56:13.576
MATT: This was me realizing that this is what
would have happened earlier, so we're taking care

00:56:13.576 --> 00:56:17.327
of it now. Okay? Because this would have been
following-- I forgot about the specter briefly

00:56:17.327 --> 00:56:19.061
earlier, and this would have happened.

00:56:19.061 --> 00:56:22.476
TALIESIN: I like that just takes responsibility
for everything that happened down there.

00:56:22.476 --> 00:56:25.121
LAURA: I like it better when he's saying, "Fuck
yourself."

00:56:25.121 --> 00:56:26.561
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair, too.

00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:31.390
MATT: I appreciate that they've completely glossed
over this scenario.

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.992
TALIESIN: That's very fair, yeah.

00:56:32.992 --> 00:56:37.732
LAURA: I think we should stick with the
go-fuck-yourself version and say "I

00:56:37.732 --> 00:56:43.037
intentionally--" he intentionally let him go, and
he knew that he was going to fuck over the city

00:56:43.037 --> 00:56:43.966
and run.

00:56:43.966 --> 00:56:46.984
LIAM: I agree with you, Jester, I think we should
stick with "Go fuck yourself."

00:56:46.984 --> 00:56:49.024
LAURA: Okay. Sincerely--

00:56:49.024 --> 00:56:51.947
SAM: I mean, I don't know if I'm really here right
now, so.

00:56:51.947 --> 00:56:54.989
MATT: We'll say that you guys are all together.

00:56:54.989 --> 00:56:56.205
SAM: Okay, that sounds good.

00:56:56.205 --> 00:56:59.291
TRAVIS: Christ, it's a letter; just fucking write
it and send it.

00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:02.474
LAURA: I'm leaving it in the office, Fjord.

00:57:02.474 --> 00:57:03.123
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:57:03.123 --> 00:57:06.219
LIAM: Maybe something like, choke upon your woe.

00:57:06.219 --> 00:57:08.634
LAURA: Choke upon your woe!

00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:11.244
LIAM: Or eat fecal matters.

00:57:11.244 --> 00:57:14.620
LAURA: Or eat fecal matter, question mark? Signed
Algar.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.277
(laughter)

00:57:17.277 --> 00:57:21.033
MATT: Go ahead and roll for your forgery kit.

00:57:21.033 --> 00:57:22.098
LAURA: With proficiency.

00:57:22.098 --> 00:57:24.742
MATT: With proficiency, so d20 plus-- I'll say
this is for intelligence--

00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:29.385
SAM: Do you want to look at the dodecahedron
first?

00:57:29.385 --> 00:57:31.351
LAURA: Oh yeah! I do, I do!

00:57:31.351 --> 00:57:35.567
SAM: Before you write this letter, let's time jump
again. Before you write the letter--

00:57:35.567 --> 00:57:36.618
LAURA: I focus.

00:57:36.618 --> 00:57:39.386
MATT: Okay, so you have a fragment of
possibility.

00:57:39.386 --> 00:57:42.440
LAURA: Depending on how I roll, I can roll again?

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.899
LIAM: Take a hit of the dodec.

00:57:43.899 --> 00:57:48.720
LAURA: Ooh! That's dexterity plus proficiency?

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.326
MATT: I'm saying, because it's a forgery and it's
having to pay attention to details, I'm going to

00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:55.715
say intellect. Intelligence.

00:57:55.715 --> 00:57:56.861
LAURA: Really?

00:57:56.861 --> 00:57:57.577
MATT: Yeah.

00:57:57.577 --> 00:57:58.578
LIAM: Did you roll twice?

00:57:58.578 --> 00:58:00.709
LAURA: No, I didn't roll twice. Okay.

00:58:00.709 --> 00:58:02.878
MATT: You don't have to roll twice. You don't have
to spend it if you don't want it.

00:58:02.878 --> 00:58:09.889
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to spend it, just in case.
Proficiency bonus is just your initiative? Where's

00:58:09.889 --> 00:58:11.467
your proficiency?

00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:12.959
MATT: Plus three, I think?

00:58:12.959 --> 00:58:14.395
LAURA: So 22.

00:58:14.395 --> 00:58:18.203
MATT: 22. Pretty good forgery. You're proud of
yourself. It looks pretty spot-on based on his

00:58:18.203 --> 00:58:24.128
handwriting. You've followed his cadence, his
sentence structure. His signature looks incredible.

00:58:24.128 --> 00:58:26.070
SAM: The dicks look like his dicks.

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:28.329
TALIESIN: I'm impressed by the dicks, actually.

00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:31.701
LAURA: Thank you, thank you. All right, I'm
leaving this on his desk.

00:58:31.701 --> 00:58:34.242
SAM: Should you put it on the door with like a
dagger?

00:58:34.242 --> 00:58:34.929
LAURA: Ooh!

00:58:34.929 --> 00:58:36.419
TALIESIN: With his dagger.

00:58:36.419 --> 00:58:41.619
SAM: With his-- I left his dagger. Shit. I could
go back down the hall and get it?

00:58:41.619 --> 00:58:46.742
LAURA: No. I'll just maybe tape it.

00:58:46.742 --> 00:58:49.864
SAM: I have extra daggers, do you want a dagger? I
have three extra daggers.

00:58:49.864 --> 00:58:51.838
TALIESIN: Oh, he had a quill, didn't he?

00:58:51.838 --> 00:58:52.683
MATT: Yeah.

00:58:52.683 --> 00:58:54.546
LAURA: With a quill!

00:58:54.546 --> 00:58:56.515
SAM: Yeah! Through the paper.

00:58:56.515 --> 00:58:59.238
MATT: I'll say with your strength you can easily
do so. It will break the quill, technically, but

00:58:59.238 --> 00:59:01.789
it still pierces it to the door. There you go.

00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:03.838
LIAM: Angry writer.

00:59:03.838 --> 00:59:05.904
LAURA: It's pretty threatening, it's a feather.

00:59:05.904 --> 00:59:10.567
MATT: Cool, so the letter is complete and placed.

00:59:10.567 --> 00:59:15.186
LAURA: Should we go down and escape the other way
so nobody sees-- Oh, I guess you guys already left.

00:59:15.467 --> 00:59:19.855
SAM: We already left. We're taking Jorge to the
docks, right?

00:59:19.855 --> 00:59:21.937
TRAVIS: No, we're all back together now.

00:59:21.937 --> 00:59:23.981
SAM: Did we go to the docks?

00:59:23.981 --> 00:59:32.019
MATT: Yes, we're-- Okay. This is my fault for
forgetting one feature earlier and trying to fit

00:59:32.019 --> 00:59:38.647
it into the narrative here. Order of business! You
arrived, you forged a letter--

00:59:38.647 --> 00:59:39.720
LAURA: We forged it!

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:44.465
MATT: You saw a weird undead thing again that was
following you and then Fjord made it go away with

00:59:44.465 --> 00:59:49.836
a hand wave. You then took Jorge to the docks and
sent him on his way.

00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:51.844
SAM: Great! Now where are we? On the docks?

00:59:51.844 --> 00:59:54.762
MATT: You guys are near the docks, you've made
your way out.

00:59:58.382 --> 01:00:01.184
SAM: What do we do with Jorge? I'm kidding!

01:00:01.184 --> 01:00:04.892
(laughter)

01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:08.640
TRAVIS: Well, I feel like that kind of went about
as well as it could have.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.449
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:00:09.449 --> 01:00:12.138
TALIESIN: I think I should go get the boat.

01:00:12.138 --> 01:00:13.100
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.100
TALIESIN: I'm going to head towards where we
anchored the boat.

01:00:18.387 --> 01:00:23.625
MATT: Okay. It's still there floating. You can see
there's one fisherman who's eyeing it curiously.

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:28.012
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Calm Emotions on
myself and go swim to the boat.

01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:36.017
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and make your way out,
get up on the side of it, and begin to row

01:00:36.017 --> 01:00:44.902
yourself back to the edge of the dock. There, not
far away, is the old fisherman you had spoken to

01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:50.130
earlier that you had borrowed it from. You gather
your things out of it and he comes over and is

01:00:50.257 --> 01:00:54.522
like, "Well, I appreciate you bringing this
back."

01:00:54.522 --> 01:01:00.048
TALIESIN: It's no problem. I think I've had enough
ocean for a while. That was--

01:01:00.048 --> 01:01:03.575
MATT: "No such thing. No such thing!'"

01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:04.979
TALIESIN: Have a good day!

01:01:04.979 --> 01:01:07.293
MATT: "You too, tall one."

01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:12.427
TRAVIS: What do we do now?

01:01:12.427 --> 01:01:21.832
MARISHA: I turn around and I look at the city. Do
I notice... commerce? Does it look like things are

01:01:21.832 --> 01:01:22.628
slowing down?

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:24.566
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:24.566 --> 01:01:26.654
LIAM: Are we now Bane?

01:01:26.939 --> 01:01:32.098
MARISHA: Well, that was a garbage roll. Seven.
That's terrible.

01:01:32.098 --> 01:01:36.050
MATT: It looks like the city. I mean, at this
point in the day, it's getting a little later. The

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:44.277
sky is starting to get a bit-- maybe the oranges
of dusk are starting to peek in a little bit. You

01:01:44.277 --> 01:01:47.483
maybe have another hour or so of daylight.

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.701
MARISHA: Do I see Merpol anywhere?

01:01:50.701 --> 01:01:52.603
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:55.374 --> 01:01:56.637
TRAVIS: See who?

01:01:56.637 --> 01:02:01.105
MARISHA: Merpol, that guy that I flirted with.
11.

01:02:01.105 --> 01:02:03.236
MATT: Currently, no. You don't see him anywhere.

01:02:03.236 --> 01:02:06.318
MARISHA: Thank god. All right.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:14.175
SAM: We could go back to Jester's mom and report.
We could go to that tower and investigate it.

01:02:14.175 --> 01:02:15.358
TRAVIS: We could do both.

01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:16.410
SAM: We could.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:18.663
TALIESIN: I'll admit, I'm a little tired.

01:02:18.663 --> 01:02:20.163
LAURA: That's true.

01:02:20.163 --> 01:02:21.721
TALIESIN: That was a lot.

01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:30.122
MARISHA: We also wanted to check in to... Did we
want to try and be at the docks at midnight?

01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:32.726
SAM: Oh, to meet Marius?

01:02:32.726 --> 01:02:40.975
MARISHA: Yes. He hangs out at the docks at
midnight, and does Marius know Sabian and Cadmus?

01:02:40.975 --> 01:02:43.074
LIAM: That's unclear at this point, isn't it?

01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:44.495
MATT: Yeah, you don't know.

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:47.358
LIAM: Do you have that letter, by the way? Who has
that?

01:02:47.358 --> 01:02:49.074
MARISHA: The letter?

01:02:49.074 --> 01:02:51.142
LIAM: The letter that mentions Marius LePual.

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:54.906
LAURA: Is he there every midnight or just tonight
midnight?

01:02:54.906 --> 01:02:56.412
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:02:56.412 --> 01:03:01.582
LAURA: Because if we wait until tomorrow, I can
Zone of Truth him.

01:03:01.582 --> 01:03:07.957
MARISHA: Orly said he likes to hang out around the
docks at midnight to look for work or something.

01:03:07.957 --> 01:03:10.996
LIAM: Caleb would've remembered that, too. I
don't, though.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:16.102
MATT: Yeah. I mean, occasionally he's out there
looking for work. That's as much as Orly knew.

01:03:16.102 --> 01:03:18.013
TRAVIS: Sabian was?

01:03:18.013 --> 01:03:20.337
MATT: Marius.

01:03:20.337 --> 01:03:26.825
MARISHA: Sabian we've heard about through Orly,
right?

01:03:26.825 --> 01:03:30.360
MATT: No, Sabian you heard about through Fjord.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.523
MARISHA: Through what?

01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:32.653
TRAVIS: Me.

01:03:32.653 --> 01:03:36.430
MARISHA: Yeah, but didn't we talk to like Captain
Adella and someone else? Someone gave us the news--

01:03:36.532 --> 01:03:38.761
MATT: You got some information about Sabian, yes.

01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:41.318
MARISHA: That they were doing the Widow's Embrace
thing and that they're pirates.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.227
MATT: Yeah, that was through Captain Adella.

01:03:43.227 --> 01:03:45.587
MARISHA: That was through Adella, okay. Okay,
okay, okay, sorry.

01:03:45.587 --> 01:03:47.279
TRAVIS: Let's make our way back towards the--

01:03:47.279 --> 01:03:49.099
(under his breath) Jesus Christ.

01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:50.539
MARISHA: Lavish Chateau.

01:03:50.808 --> 01:03:54.700
TRAVIS: Yep. I've got to take more organized
notes. Maybe we can stop by the fancy tower on the

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.385
way back?

01:03:56.385 --> 01:04:01.106
LIAM: I am very interested in that tower, but I
would love to ask some more questions around town

01:04:01.106 --> 01:04:04.131
before assailing it.

01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.465
TRAVIS: Sure. About what time is it?

01:04:06.465 --> 01:04:09.338
MATT: It's close to dusk. About an hour of
daylight left.

01:04:09.338 --> 01:04:11.212
TRAVIS: Right, you said that.

01:04:11.212 --> 01:04:14.445
SAM: Do we go towards the Lavish Chateau?

01:04:14.445 --> 01:04:16.186
LAURA: Yeah, let's go tell Mama what we did!

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.381
SAM: Yeah!

01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:21.842
MARISHA: We'll go to the Lavish Chateau and we'll
just walk by the tower on our way back to give it

01:04:21.842 --> 01:04:23.814
another look-see.

01:04:23.814 --> 01:04:28.927
MATT: Okay. It's a little bit of a roundabout
walk, but you can do it. All right, so you make

01:04:28.927 --> 01:04:37.147
your way back to the Open Quay. Heading towards
the tower, you can see, as you approach, based on

01:04:37.147 --> 01:04:45.092
whatever illusory enchantment finds your vision,
you can see as it seems to grow the closer you get

01:04:45.092 --> 01:04:50.758
to it, to the point where it's massively towering
when you're right below it. Still no sign of a

01:04:50.758 --> 01:04:59.219
door, at first glance. You still have the
20-foot-up or so balcony and a few other windows

01:04:59.219 --> 01:05:03.691
up that way. You can see the top two windows have,
now that it's gotten darker, you can there's a

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:07.360
little bit of a firelight glow at the very top of
it.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.899
LIAM: Have I ever read about anything like this? A
building that seems to shift in size.

01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:14.307
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:05:15.844 --> 01:05:20.696
LAURA: Can I look around and see if the city seems
like it's being affected at all by the no power?

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:24.786
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:26.642
LIAM: Ten.

01:05:26.642 --> 01:05:33.089
MATT: Ten? You assume it's either some sort of
spatial enchantment to it, or it's an illusion,

01:05:33.089 --> 01:05:35.637
maybe. That's as much as you can make out from
it.

01:05:35.637 --> 01:05:36.856
LIAM: Okay.

01:05:36.856 --> 01:05:38.421
LAURA: (whispering) Natural 20.

01:05:38.421 --> 01:05:43.754
MATT: Natural 20. The city doesn't appear to be
heavily changed by any means--

01:05:43.754 --> 01:05:45.996
LAURA: I think it's fine.

01:05:45.996 --> 01:05:55.240
MATT: You do notice that, where previously there
were some plumes of white smoke or steam that rose

01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:06.495
from certain, more industrial aspects of the city,
are much thinner, appearing to be more residual

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:09.725
columns of steam and smoke.

01:06:09.725 --> 01:06:11.456
LAURA: Oh God, oh God, oh God.

01:06:11.456 --> 01:06:13.027
SAM: We'll be fine.

01:06:13.027 --> 01:06:15.228
TRAVIS: No bigs.

01:06:15.228 --> 01:06:23.674
MATT: You're at the tower. The Tide Peak Tower.
Anything you want to do?

01:06:23.674 --> 01:06:26.185
TRAVIS: I'm tapped. I can't do anything.

01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:29.788
SAM: You boys just wanted to come look at the
tower again because you like it?

01:06:29.788 --> 01:06:31.658
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:06:31.658 --> 01:06:33.992
LIAM: Don't look at me.

01:06:33.992 --> 01:06:39.337
MARISHA: I mean, kind of. We wanted to see if it
changed, or if anything's different, or if we see

01:06:39.337 --> 01:06:41.750
a mysterious figure in a window.

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:43.386
SAM: There's no windows.

01:06:43.386 --> 01:06:46.039
TRAVIS: It doesn't bother you that it grows taller
as you get closer?

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:47.148
SAM: It's pretty freaky.

01:06:47.148 --> 01:06:48.097
TRAVIS: No doors.

01:06:48.097 --> 01:06:53.920
LIAM: Oh, it's fascinating. We learned that
whoever owns this place owns the district, isn't

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.779
that correct?

01:06:54.779 --> 01:06:56.003
MATT: Yep.

01:06:56.003 --> 01:06:59.720
LIAM: So someone in this district probably knows
something about the person who owns the district.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.152
MARISHA: It's Yussa Errennis, right?

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:03.946
MATT: Yussa Errennis.

01:07:03.946 --> 01:07:05.508
SAM: Hey, Caleb!

01:07:05.508 --> 01:07:06.428
LIAM: Yeah?

01:07:06.428 --> 01:07:10.230
SAM: You memorized the map of the underground
pathways, right?

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.166
LIAM: Correct.

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.376
SAM: Do any of them run under this tower?

01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:16.644
LIAM: Well, there was no marking for a tower.

01:07:16.644 --> 01:07:20.729
SAM: Using your spatial, Beautiful Mind
techniques.

01:07:20.729 --> 01:07:22.369
LIAM: No idea.

01:07:22.602 --> 01:07:28.758
MATT: Make an intelligence check to see if you can
overlay the memory of the sketch you saw with the

01:07:28.758 --> 01:07:30.616
location in the Quay.

01:07:30.616 --> 01:07:32.509
LIAM: Just raw intelligence?

01:07:32.509 --> 01:07:34.184
MATT: Yep.

01:07:35.568 --> 01:07:37.104
LIAM: That is a 16.

01:07:37.104 --> 01:07:43.940
MATT: 16. You feel like you've been able to take
the two and map them together pretty well. Nothing

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:52.147
passes directly beneath the tower, no. The Sluice
isn't a wide network. It's a handful of

01:07:52.147 --> 01:07:58.799
deliberately placed tunnels to make their way
towards specific parts of different districts.

01:07:58.799 --> 01:08:02.069
LIAM: That diagram wasn't elaborate enough for me
to know the answer to that.

01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:05.363
MARISHA: Okay. Let's go to the Lavish Chateau?

01:08:05.363 --> 01:08:07.323
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:08:07.323 --> 01:08:12.224
MATT: All right. By the time you make it to the
Lavish Chateau, it is sunset. The last bit of

01:08:12.224 --> 01:08:17.526
light that vanishes over the horizon far over the
ocean, the Lucidian Ocean in the distance. You

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:24.320
make your way to the interior, where a number of
folks have finally gathered. Maybe a handful, six

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:31.617
or seven people, are already in there enjoying
meals, having drinks. You know that there isn't a

01:08:31.617 --> 01:08:37.593
performance tonight, but people are in there
enjoying the relatively, comparably classy

01:08:37.593 --> 01:08:44.303
atmosphere, as the familiar band plays their
music. What do you want to do?

01:08:44.303 --> 01:08:47.608
LAURA: I also used another Disguise Self spell to
make sure I stay--

01:08:47.608 --> 01:08:49.287
MATT: Good call.

01:08:49.287 --> 01:08:51.591
LAURA: Tortley.

01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:53.844
SAM: Are we just here to see your mom?

01:08:53.844 --> 01:08:56.684
LAURA: Yeah, probably should tell her.

01:08:56.684 --> 01:08:58.107
LIAM: I spiffed up my clothing again, as well.

01:08:58.107 --> 01:08:59.956
MATT: Okay.

01:08:59.956 --> 01:09:03.015
SAM: How do we get upstairs with you all tortley?

01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:04.946
LAURA: Just go upstairs.

01:09:04.946 --> 01:09:08.796
SAM: All right. Let's go upstairs.

01:09:08.796 --> 01:09:11.107
LAURA: Okay, I go upstairs.

01:09:11.107 --> 01:09:21.386
MATT: All right. You guys make your way up to the
third flight. You missed him last time, but you

01:09:21.386 --> 01:09:28.367
come upon the familiar sight, to you, which was
your mother's personal bodyguard for half of the

01:09:28.367 --> 01:09:32.950
time at the Chateau, Bluude.

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:34.903
LAURA: Bluude!

01:09:34.903 --> 01:09:40.128
MATT: Which was also responsible at times to watch
you and escort you when you went to the city. The

01:09:40.128 --> 01:09:45.060
rest of you are caught off-guard by the sight of
this massive, dual-horned minotaur.

01:09:45.222 --> 01:09:46.851
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:09:46.851 --> 01:09:58.380
MATT: Wearing a very, very fine shirt, but is
Donald Ducking it the rest of the way. Thankfully,

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:04.461
relatively thick, thick fur down there. You'd have
to pry to get a good look. But is standing there,

01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:12.361
arms crossed, and goes, "Oh, Jester!" He comes
over and picks you up... Actually, no, he wouldn't

01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:15.929
recognize you because you're a tortle.

01:10:15.929 --> 01:10:18.819
LAURA: Doesn't he know that I am Jester, still?

01:10:18.872 --> 01:10:21.438
MATT: Probably not. Not unless you say anything.

01:10:21.438 --> 01:10:26.983
LAURA: Bluude, it's me!

01:10:28.643 --> 01:10:32.907
MATT: Now we go into the "Oh, Jester!" There we
go, that's the moment.

01:10:33.299 --> 01:10:35.290
LAURA: My tortle eyebrows are going like this.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:36.927
MATT: Right, right.

01:10:36.927 --> 01:10:39.162
LIAM: This one's name is Bluute?

01:10:39.162 --> 01:10:40.929
LAURA: His name is Bluude.

01:10:40.929 --> 01:10:42.594
LIAM: Not Bluute, but Bluude?

01:10:42.594 --> 01:10:43.466
MATT: With a D.

01:10:43.466 --> 01:10:45.153
LIAM: With a D, okay.

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:48.040
LAURA: We're here to see Mama.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:55.476
MATT: "Of course, I assume that is the case." He
knocks on the door. At that point, the door opens

01:10:55.476 --> 01:11:02.412
up a bit and peeking through is the Ruby of the
Sea, Marion, whose hair is perfectly curled, even

01:11:02.412 --> 01:11:09.187
without an evening performance. She smiles at the
sight of all of you at the door and looks

01:11:09.187 --> 01:11:13.822
curiously at the large skirt-faring tortle.

01:11:15.278 --> 01:11:16.659
"Hello?"

01:11:16.659 --> 01:11:18.812
LAURA: Hi! Do you have company?

01:11:18.812 --> 01:11:20.647
MATT: "Not at the moment, no."

01:11:20.647 --> 01:11:23.389
LAURA: Can we come in and talk to you for just a
second?

01:11:23.389 --> 01:11:28.968
MATT: "Oh, Jester! Hi! Yeah, please, do come
inside, everyone. Come on." You all make your way

01:11:28.968 --> 01:11:30.940
into the chamber.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.397
LAURA: I'll drop the disguise spell once we're
inside.

01:11:33.397 --> 01:11:37.896
MATT: Okay. She shoos out her servants, and the
door closes.

01:11:37.896 --> 01:11:42.334
SAM: Oh! This is Yasha. Has she met Yasha?

01:11:42.334 --> 01:11:44.020
LAURA: (whispering) This is Yasha.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:48.266
MATT: She has not. She's like, "Oh, my goodness!
It is so nice to meet you, Yasha." She shakes her

01:11:48.266 --> 01:11:57.682
hand and Yasha awkwardly, "Hi," and looks to the
rest of you and leans towards the back wall and

01:11:57.682 --> 01:12:06.049
crosses her arms. Not one for social graces,
necessarily, but seemingly looking at Marion,

01:12:06.049 --> 01:12:12.447
looking at Jester, looking at Marion, and can see
the relation. Marion sits down in front of her

01:12:12.447 --> 01:12:23.501
mirror and her little table set up in the corner,
spins back towards the rest of you. "Welcome back.

01:12:23.501 --> 01:12:29.460
There is no performance tonight, I apologize, but
if you would like us to provide food for you or

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.800
whatever you like, please, do not bother to let me
know."

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.983
LAURA: So, you know that guy?

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:41.316
MATT: "There are a number of guys that I know,
yes."

01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:42.675
LAURA: The guy that was bugging you.

01:12:42.675 --> 01:12:43.971
MATT: "Algar, yes."

01:12:43.971 --> 01:12:46.452
LAURA: We went to go talk to him, but he had
already left.

01:12:46.452 --> 01:12:48.058
MATT: "He left?"

01:12:48.058 --> 01:12:52.103
LAURA: Yes, he had fled the city, apparently.
Things happened, they were real bad or something,

01:12:52.103 --> 01:12:53.776
I don't know.

01:12:53.776 --> 01:13:03.711
MATT: "Huh. Well, that may very well be a great
turn of luck in my benefit, definitely. Thank you

01:13:03.711 --> 01:13:05.369
for looking into that."

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:09.461
LAURA: Of course! Yeah, we were going to talk to
him and everything, but he is gone, so...

01:13:10.403 --> 01:13:16.126
MATT: " Well... that makes me feel more
comfortable, thank you very much."

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.462
LAURA: Of course.

01:13:17.462 --> 01:13:19.015
MATT: "I appreciate it."

01:13:20.805 --> 01:13:23.059
LAURA: Do you guys want to eat anything?

01:13:23.219 --> 01:13:26.851
(sounds of agreement)

01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:31.048
MATT: "Very well! I will ensure that you are all
properly taken care of this night." (clapping

01:13:31.048 --> 01:13:36.760
twice) She goes ahead and brings the servants back
in. A meal is placed for the rest of you, and as

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.453
the evening progresses, and you take a bit of time
to rest--

01:13:40.453 --> 01:13:42.517
MARISHA: Like a short rest?

01:13:42.517 --> 01:13:46.452
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and take a short rest. You
guys manage to enjoy probably one of the better

01:13:46.452 --> 01:13:48.838
meals you've had in a while.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.666
SAM: Jester, why did you lie to your mom?

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:54.105
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:13:54.105 --> 01:13:56.471
LAURA: Is my mom still in this room?

01:13:56.471 --> 01:13:58.920
SAM: We're whispering, she can't hear us.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.697
LAURA: Look, here's the thing--

01:14:01.055 --> 01:14:05.396
MATT: You guys are eating downstairs. They're not
bringing room service up into her chambers.

01:14:05.396 --> 01:14:07.359
LIAM: Oh, so we're no longer with Marion?

01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:08.370
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:09.537
LIAM: Okay.

01:14:09.537 --> 01:14:12.138
LAURA: Look, I don't want her getting in trouble
for anything that happened.

01:14:12.138 --> 01:14:13.634
SAM: Why would she get in trouble? We did it.

01:14:13.634 --> 01:14:16.857
LAURA: I don't know! The less she knows, the
better! What if she found out something and she

01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:19.249
judged me for it because we did something bad?

01:14:19.249 --> 01:14:22.161
SAM: What if she finds out you lied to her and
judges you for that?

01:14:22.161 --> 01:14:24.035
LAURA: She won't. Why would she find out?

01:14:24.035 --> 01:14:28.678
LIAM: You know, I had the same thought. Really,
either she believes Jester and no big deal, or she

01:14:28.678 --> 01:14:32.426
doesn't believe Jester and knows that it's taken
care of.

01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:36.634
SAM: You should never lie to your mother.

01:14:36.634 --> 01:14:43.344
LAURA: Well, I usually don't. It's just to protect
her. It is a white lie.

01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:45.299
SAM: All right.

01:14:47.457 --> 01:14:52.954
MATT: You hear the heavy footfalls of Bluude
making his way down the stairs and goes and finds

01:14:52.954 --> 01:14:58.805
a corner just to keep an eye. Then Marion, now
dressed in her casual evening gown, which in

01:14:58.805 --> 01:15:04.248
itself is still regal and beautiful and trails
behind her up the stairs as she descends, comes to

01:15:04.248 --> 01:15:10.604
join you at the table and sits. She smiles at the
rest of you and gives a renewed nod to Yasha, whom

01:15:10.604 --> 01:15:21.046
she just met. "Well, I am very happy to see that
you've made a good group of friends, a travel

01:15:21.046 --> 01:15:26.168
family. Just warms my heart."

01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:30.221
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.834
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:32.158 --> 01:15:33.797
MATT: "Is everything all right?"

01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:35.334
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:35.334 --> 01:15:38.221
LAURA: Oh no, is it bad? What did I do? Was it
bad?

01:15:38.221 --> 01:15:43.322
SAM: You didn't do anything. No, this is very
good.

01:15:43.322 --> 01:15:47.263
LIAM: Jester feels like that perhaps she is
imposing, bringing all of us here, and we are

01:15:47.263 --> 01:15:49.316
trying to convince her that that is silly.

01:15:49.316 --> 01:15:53.728
MATT: "Not in the slightest! Jester, this is no
imposition. I'm just happy to have you home for a bit."

01:15:53.892 --> 01:15:57.509
LAURA: I'm happy to be home for a bit.

01:15:57.509 --> 01:16:00.103
MATT: "How long do you intend to stay?"

01:16:00.103 --> 01:16:07.354
LAURA: Oh, well, I don't know. We're here for
Fjord, really, so it's up to him.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:11.446
TRAVIS: That's not true, this is your home! It's
where you're from.

01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:14.436
LAURA: Weren't you trying to find out about the
guys?

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:16.789
TRAVIS: Yeah, we have time.

01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:22.084
LAURA: Fjord swallowed a ball, and it's inside of
him now, and he doesn't know what's going on, so--

01:16:22.084 --> 01:16:25.611
TRAVIS: We're going to tell the truth about <i>that</i>?

01:16:27.886 --> 01:16:32.923
MATT: "I have a friend who had a similar problem
years ago. If you would like, there is a physician

01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:38.424
we could have take a look at you and see if we can
a way to no longer have that problem?"

01:16:38.424 --> 01:16:41.188
MARISHA: Oh man, I want to hear that story.

01:16:41.188 --> 01:16:43.073
TRAVIS: I would be glad to--

01:16:43.073 --> 01:16:44.918
LAURA: Mama, it's not that kind of ball he
swallowed.

01:16:44.918 --> 01:16:46.761
SAM: You had a friend that swallowed a stone?

01:16:46.761 --> 01:16:52.663
LIAM: <i>Frau</i> Lavorre, you have such a lovely
daughter. She's so charming and such a spitfire.

01:16:52.663 --> 01:16:59.338
It has been such a pleasure to get to know her.
I've been curious for weeks now, almost months-- I

01:16:59.338 --> 01:17:04.524
think it's been almost months-- what she was like
as a child, because she's such a joy now.

01:17:04.971 --> 01:17:15.124
MATT: "Ah, young Jester was rambunctious, curious,
ever running off, getting into, well, trouble, and

01:17:15.124 --> 01:17:24.425
finding trouble, making trouble. For me, it was a
joy. She was very quick to learn, ever smiling,

01:17:24.425 --> 01:17:32.853
brightening any chamber she walked into. She had a
good sense for who needed to be taken down a peg."

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:37.243
LIAM: So she was always a prankster.

01:17:37.243 --> 01:17:42.300
MATT: "Very much so, more so around adolescence, I
think."

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.334
LAURA: Yeah, I guess so.

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:50.815
MATT: "But she has always been sweet,
inspirational--"

01:17:50.815 --> 01:17:53.817
LAURA: Very sweet, see? I am very sweet.

01:17:54.168 --> 01:17:55.802
MATT: "Very proud of her."

01:17:55.802 --> 01:17:58.252
MARISHA: Do you have any good embarrassing
stories?

01:17:58.252 --> 01:18:04.035
MATT: "Yes but not anything I can speak of in
mixed company."

01:18:04.035 --> 01:18:05.929
MARISHA: Are we in mixed company?

01:18:05.929 --> 01:18:09.946
MATT: You guys are in the downstairs, in the main
tavern area of the Chateau.

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:12.084
MARISHA: Right, right.

01:18:12.084 --> 01:18:18.268
LAURA: I didn't get to come down here very much
and eat with you. It's nice to be able to be here now.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.422
MATT: "I agree."

01:18:20.422 --> 01:18:23.369
LAURA: Shit. I'm not disguised, fuck. I need to
remember to do this more.

01:18:25.359 --> 01:18:26.829
(dice hit the table)

01:18:26.829 --> 01:18:28.452
MARISHA: Oh no!

01:18:28.827 --> 01:18:31.415
SAM: Do you want to borrow my mask?

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.178
LAURA: Oh no. I have that other mask that I
bought.

01:18:34.178 --> 01:18:35.918
SAM: What mask?

01:18:35.918 --> 01:18:40.100
LAURA: Remember the metal mask, that I bought when
I was with you? I'm going to put it on.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.213
SAM: Yeah, that's good dinner wear.

01:18:42.213 --> 01:18:51.537
MATT: It's a big old cast iron tiki mask with
giant tusks, oof. All right.

01:18:51.537 --> 01:18:55.109
TRAVIS: With tiefling horns and tail coming out of
it.

01:18:56.018 --> 01:19:03.376
MATT: "Curious choice, but I understand probably
for the best. There is not much of a mouth hole,

01:19:03.376 --> 01:19:10.868
so eating is going to be very difficult." Takes a
little spoon and is like, "All right, here we go

01:19:10.994 --> 01:19:18.560
try to make it-- there it is. Perfect." You guys
talk for a bit. She shares some embarrassing

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:25.682
stories of Jester's childhood. Asks each of you a
little bit about your story, and we'll say for the

01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:31.598
better part of the evening, it's an enjoyable
respite from the chaos of the day and the chaos of

01:19:31.598 --> 01:19:38.419
the journey. Your blink dog has dried, as has your
weasel.

01:19:38.419 --> 01:19:41.654
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Can I go check on Professor
Thaddeus?

01:19:41.654 --> 01:19:49.393
MATT: You can, and as you go ahead and find--
there is a coat room, essentially, where the young

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:55.790
man who had originally met you when you got there
is inside. You can see him sitting in the back on

01:19:55.790 --> 01:20:03.100
a stool going like this. He's staring in the far
way, and there's a coat rack where Professor

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:09.205
Thaddeus is sitting on there, staring at him. As
you enter the chamber--

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:10.184
MARISHA: Hey.

01:20:10.184 --> 01:20:11.454
MATT: "Oh, hey."

01:20:11.577 --> 01:20:12.973
MARISHA: Is my bird okay?

01:20:12.973 --> 01:20:19.336
MATT: You can see there's some scratches on his
cheek. "Yeah, he's fine. Just watching him right there."

01:20:19.872 --> 01:20:23.898
MARISHA: Uh-huh. You didn't traumatize him, did
you?

01:20:23.898 --> 01:20:29.728
MATT: I think not? Hard to feed these.

01:20:29.728 --> 01:20:37.202
MARISHA: Yeah, I know. I grab the food that I just
took from my plate and I'm like, "Thaddeus, come.

01:20:37.202 --> 01:20:39.818
Thaddeus?"

01:20:39.818 --> 01:20:41.965
MATT: Roll an animal handling check.

01:20:41.965 --> 01:20:44.291
MARISHA: Fuck me. Fucking animals. Why did I do
this?

01:20:44.561 --> 01:20:48.819
Oh no. Six. Fuck that die.

01:20:48.819 --> 01:20:51.292
TRAVIS: "I'm going to have an owl!"

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:59.456
MATT: He dives towards you and goes right over
your shoulder and is now in the middle of the

01:20:59.456 --> 01:21:08.991
central tavern. (fluttering) The leather cord of
his leash is now dangling as he's up in the

01:21:08.991 --> 01:21:12.170
rafters (hooting).

01:21:12.361 --> 01:21:15.514
MARISHA: I can't control him, you guys. He has a
mind of his own. He's a free person.

01:21:15.514 --> 01:21:18.600
MATT: Everyone in the chamber's like-- there're
people that are eating who are like, "What the--?"

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.914
They're all staring up at this owl that has now
found a brief perch up into the roof chamber.

01:21:23.058 --> 01:21:27.217
MARISHA: Oh, you've all seen an owl before, shut
up!

01:21:27.217 --> 01:21:30.418
TRAVIS: I think they're worried about the--
(whistles)

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.218
MARISHA: It'll be fine.

01:21:32.218 --> 01:21:38.545
LIAM: Caleb summons Frumpkin the octopus and I rub
his head like a Bond villain, staring at Beau.

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:41.261
MATT: Squeaks like a balloon.

01:21:41.261 --> 01:21:50.647
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull one of the beetles out
of my staff and say, "Professor, you want a

01:21:50.647 --> 01:21:55.311
snack?" I hold it up.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:56.875
MATT: You're holding the beetle?

01:21:56.875 --> 01:21:58.420
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.980
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.005
SAM: Oh boy, there goes your finger.

01:22:05.606 --> 01:22:06.857
TALIESIN: 12.

01:22:06.857 --> 01:22:13.726
MATT: Eventually, it dives down, snatches and-- a
little prick on the finger from one of the

01:22:13.726 --> 01:22:19.528
talons-- but, eventually, makes a quick meal and
heads back up.

01:22:21.154 --> 01:22:22.524
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:22:23.201 --> 01:22:26.437
SAM: What happens if we have to leave and the bird
is still here?

01:22:26.437 --> 01:22:35.731
LAURA: You can climb up. Yeah, you're a monk, you
can climb up to the ceiling. Hey, Mama?

01:22:35.731 --> 01:22:37.362
MATT: "Yes?"

01:22:37.362 --> 01:22:42.342
LAURA: Will you watch my puppy? Well, it's me and
Beau's puppy, really.

01:22:42.342 --> 01:22:43.711
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:22:43.711 --> 01:22:47.814
LAURA: Will you watch our puppy while we go out
tonight?

01:22:47.814 --> 01:22:54.444
MATT: "Of course. To be honest, I've been thinking
about maybe having a pet, so this will be good training."

01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:56.311
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:22:56.311 --> 01:22:59.651
MATT: "Well, since you've been gone, you know."

01:22:59.651 --> 01:23:01.800
MARISHA: How do you feel about owls?

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.917
SAM: And a weasel?

01:23:03.917 --> 01:23:09.224
MATT: "They're interesting, definitely."

01:23:09.224 --> 01:23:16.977
LAURA: Are you good with puppies? Because this
one's kind of special.

01:23:16.977 --> 01:23:24.704
MATT: "I imagine that it is-- how is it special?
This sounds like a warning."

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:29.183
TRAVIS: (laughing) This sounds like a warning.

01:23:29.183 --> 01:23:31.235
LAURA: Nugget. Poof!

01:23:31.235 --> 01:23:33.251
SAM: Lift off your mask.

01:23:33.251 --> 01:23:35.847
LAURA: Oh, thank you. Nugget, it's me. Poof!

01:23:35.847 --> 01:23:41.712
MATT: (poof) It appears on your chest and catch it
for a second. She's like, "Oh my."

01:23:41.712 --> 01:23:43.602
LAURA: He blinks.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:49.433
MATT: "That is as tricky as, perhaps, the daughter
that I have."

01:23:49.433 --> 01:23:57.461
LAURA: Aww. I'm going to tell Nugget to look at my
Mama and say, blink to her right now, okay, for as

01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:01.055
long as we tell you to. That's home.

01:24:01.055 --> 01:24:04.166
MATT: (panting)

01:24:04.166 --> 01:24:07.555
LAURA: Mama, tell him you're home.

01:24:07.555 --> 01:24:09.925
MATT: "You're home."

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:13.430
LAURA: No, tell him you are home. You are his
home.

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:16.825
MATT: "Oh. I am your home."

01:24:16.825 --> 01:24:24.236
LAURA: That's good, here. Be careful, he pees on
things.

01:24:24.236 --> 01:24:29.295
MATT: Immediately, she goes, "Heh," and pets him
over the table.

01:24:31.515 --> 01:24:33.855
SAM: You got rid of a dog, that's great!

01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:35.936
LAURA: I didn't get rid of him.

01:24:35.936 --> 01:24:38.619
SAM: Yeah, but we don't have to have him anymore,
so that's good, right?

01:24:38.758 --> 01:24:40.684
LAURA: He's still our dog.

01:24:40.684 --> 01:24:42.122
SAM: All right.

01:24:42.122 --> 01:24:46.191
LIAM: Perhaps Nugget could live here and you could
visit him when you come home.

01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:49.912
LAURA: Maybe.

01:24:50.036 --> 01:24:51.955
SAM: The weasel and the owl?

01:24:51.955 --> 01:24:57.667
LAURA: No, the weasel's staying with me. I know,
it's such a temptation.

01:24:57.667 --> 01:25:01.148
SAM: I know, I want to eat that weasel so bad!

01:25:01.148 --> 01:25:03.516
MARISHA: Are we going to go down to the docks?

01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:04.949
SAM: Yeah. Is it almost midnight?

01:25:04.949 --> 01:25:06.548
MATT: Yeah, it's getting close. About 11, 11:20.

01:25:06.775 --> 01:25:07.816
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:07.816 --> 01:25:09.068
SAM: Let's go.

01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:10.104
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.259
MATT: All right.

01:25:11.259 --> 01:25:14.188
MARISHA: I try-- Professor Thaddeus! You want to
come?

01:25:14.188 --> 01:25:16.090
MATT: Make one more animal handling check.

01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:18.859
MARISHA: Fuck me. Just come to me, you dick.

01:25:19.022 --> 01:25:21.354
Ooh, that's a natural 19. 22.

01:25:21.354 --> 01:25:22.689
SAM: Whoa!

01:25:22.689 --> 01:25:24.548
LAURA: See? He responds when you talk sternly.

01:25:24.548 --> 01:25:26.607
MARISHA: Yeah! Fucking--

01:25:26.607 --> 01:25:32.872
MATT: Eventually, seeing this command-- (flapping)
comes to rest onto your wrist.

01:25:32.872 --> 01:25:37.830
MARISHA: (excited breathing) I mean, that's
fucking right.

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:39.495
LIAM: Third time's the charm.

01:25:39.495 --> 01:25:40.859
MARISHA: Let's go.

01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:42.940
SAM: He likes cursing, I guess.

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.366
TRAVIS: Is he coming with?

01:25:45.366 --> 01:25:47.455
MARISHA: He's coming with us to the docks, I
guess.

01:25:47.455 --> 01:25:51.755
TRAVIS: Okay, yep. Good. We're inconspicuous with
a big fucking horned owl on your arm.

01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:53.601
MARISHA: Oh, we're trying to be inconspicuous?

01:25:53.601 --> 01:25:56.051
SAM: No, it's fine. It'll be great. He'll be fine,
he can see in the dark.

01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:57.778
MARISHA: Right? Exactly.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.816
TALIESIN: We can get you a tree costume, you'll
fit right in.

01:26:00.816 --> 01:26:03.636
LIAM: We're fucking Hermione Granger up in this
shit.

01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:04.966
TRAVIS: She had a cat.

01:26:04.966 --> 01:26:07.512
LAURA: I put my hood up. I take the mask off, but
I put my hood up.

01:26:07.687 --> 01:26:12.371
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way through the
streets heading towards where?

01:26:12.371 --> 01:26:14.298
TRAVIS: The--

01:26:15.279 --> 01:26:17.587
SAM: You know. <i>The docks</i>.

01:26:17.587 --> 01:26:19.760
MATT: Yeah, well, there's the Restless Wharf and
there's the Open Quay.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.586
SAM: We were told maybe one of those?

01:26:23.586 --> 01:26:25.723
MATT: The place that you had heard this
information--

01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:27.975
LIAM: Did Orly say specific docks?

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:32.222
TRAVIS: It was the Open Quay right? Was where he
wanders at midnight?

01:26:32.222 --> 01:26:37.748
MARISHA: We were at the Wayfarer's Cove. Which is
in the Restless Wharf.

01:26:37.748 --> 01:26:41.821
MATT: You didn't get any specifics, he just said
near the docks, but you were in the Restless Wharf

01:26:41.821 --> 01:26:43.360
when you got this information.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.746
LIAM: Yes. Yes.

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:47.981
MATT: All right. Who's helming a lookout?

01:26:48.491 --> 01:26:49.913
TALIESIN: I'll do that.

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.576
SAM: I put up my hood as well.

01:26:51.576 --> 01:26:54.250
LIAM: We've got lamplight on the streets to
varying degree.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:27:01.720
MATT: Yeah. There are torch poles set up towards
the wharf that are giving a faint bit of light,

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:06.146
but other than that, it's not a full moon, but
it's mostly full and there's quite a bit of

01:27:06.146 --> 01:27:10.265
moonlight coming down over the dock. You can see
it glittering across the water in the center of

01:27:10.265 --> 01:27:16.452
the harbor. There are a number of ships quietly
set out in that vicinity. The star-clustered sky

01:27:16.452 --> 01:27:25.064
completely envelopes the air above you. It's a
beautiful view. The closer you get to the docks,

01:27:25.064 --> 01:27:30.906
you can hear the sound of waves crashing from out
of view, the creaking of wet wood filling the air

01:27:30.906 --> 01:27:35.245
as the docks shift and the number of boats that
are currently moored to the center of the harbor

01:27:35.245 --> 01:27:42.312
creak from side to side as the water comes in.
Every now and then, you see the slow glowing beam

01:27:42.312 --> 01:27:50.213
of the Lighthouse pass overhead about once a
minute or so. It's a very slow moving, pulsing

01:27:50.213 --> 01:27:59.054
rhythm. Now ships of varying sizes sit across the
dock spread, tied to their various posts, all

01:27:59.054 --> 01:28:03.676
seemingly lightless and lifeless in their slumber.
There's no one doing any sort of evening work on

01:28:03.676 --> 01:28:09.637
these ships at this hour. You see a handful of
zolezzo patrolling up and down the sides of the

01:28:09.637 --> 01:28:18.364
dock doing their rounds, no urgency or direction
necessarily. Make a perception check, if you don't

01:28:18.364 --> 01:28:20.181
mind, Clay.

01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:26.677
TALIESIN: That's a 26.

01:28:27.187 --> 01:28:31.659
MATT: 26, jesus! Okay then. You--

01:28:31.659 --> 01:28:33.272
LIAM: Wise as fuck.

01:28:35.071 --> 01:28:41.200
MATT: You watch out for one of the westernmost
docks of the district to see a shady figure

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:47.421
darting between patrols. Watching as the zolezzo
will pass and then use that moment to dart across

01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:51.297
the street and wait for the next zolezzo to pass
and then make their way over to the edge of the

01:28:51.297 --> 01:28:59.070
wharf. You see them now ducking near a stack of
empty shipping crates and they wait, every now and

01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:05.341
then glancing over when a zolezzo's not nearby or
looking towards one of the darkened ships that is

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:09.965
anchored towards one of the dock extensions, not
that far from one of the docking cranes that's

01:29:09.965 --> 01:29:16.236
left still after an evening of offloading from one
of the other ships.

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.119
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:24.610
LAURA: What do you see?

01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:31.302
TALIESIN: I mean, it's pretty quiet. Other than
that guy hiding over there by the shipping crates,

01:29:31.302 --> 01:29:33.623
there's really nothing to see.

01:29:33.623 --> 01:29:35.991
LAURA: Is he blond? Is he a blond half-elf?

01:29:35.991 --> 01:29:40.890
TALIESIN: It's really dark. I don't know. Other
than that, there's nothing really happening.

01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:42.331
LAURA: There's a guy darting.

01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:43.682
SAM: Should I go dart after him?

01:29:43.682 --> 01:29:44.598
LAURA: Ooh.

01:29:44.598 --> 01:29:45.522
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:46.842
TALIESIN: Are we playing darts?

01:29:46.842 --> 01:29:48.605
LAURA: Wait, do you want-- Blessing of the
Trickster!

01:29:48.605 --> 01:29:50.421
SAM: Ah! What does that do?

01:29:50.421 --> 01:29:52.050
LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks!

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:53.644
SAM: Okay, great.

01:29:53.644 --> 01:29:55.451
LIAM: Episode 30 something.

01:29:55.451 --> 01:29:59.700
MATT: You do watch as a zolezzo holding one of
their portable torches and a sheathed sword

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:05.682
glances over in the direction of where that shaded
figure is. Steps towards it and holds the torch up

01:30:05.731 --> 01:30:13.672
and begins a soft call out. "Hello?" The shaded
figure stands up and approaches, hands open,

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:25.099
smiling. Getting a better look, you do see finer
elven features, a lighter, ashy hair that's short

01:30:25.099 --> 01:30:32.124
on the sides and flopped in the front who
approaches, talks briefly. You can't really hear

01:30:32.124 --> 01:30:37.358
what they're saying, it's hushed, but puts
something into the hands of the zolezzo. The

01:30:37.358 --> 01:30:41.787
zolezzo takes a moment, nods and then turns around
and leaves his post.

01:30:41.868 --> 01:30:43.850
TALIESIN: That's really useful information.

01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:45.084
LAURA: Ooh.

01:30:45.084 --> 01:30:46.461
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:30:46.461 --> 01:30:49.562
MATT: The figure goes and then darts back behind
the crates once more and keeps looking over

01:30:49.562 --> 01:30:55.680
towards that one single ship that's about 35 or 40
feet from where he's sitting.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.930
LAURA: I wonder what he's waiting for.

01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:00.652
MARISHA: Yeah. Looks like someone that's waiting
for a handoff if I've seen them.

01:31:00.652 --> 01:31:02.883
TALIESIN: I wonder how much he paid to bribe the
guard.

01:31:02.883 --> 01:31:06.392
MARISHA: Apparently five gold is a great going
rate.

01:31:06.392 --> 01:31:07.920
LAURA: That's true. That's what we did.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.035
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:31:09.035 --> 01:31:10.702
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:31:11.047 --> 01:31:18.684
SAM: Seeing as there's no guard, I'm going to dart
over towards where he's hiding, but not right on

01:31:18.684 --> 01:31:21.059
him or anything, across the way.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:22.942
MATT: Make a stealth check with advantage.

01:31:22.942 --> 01:31:25.561
SAM: Ooh, that's a one. That's slightly better.

01:31:25.707 --> 01:31:27.173
MARISHA: Ooh, that's right!

01:31:27.173 --> 01:31:29.929
SAM: Stealth? 17.

01:31:29.929 --> 01:31:43.866
MATT: Okay. You make your way over to the side of
the docks on the opposite end and there's a little

01:31:43.866 --> 01:31:47.732
step up from this edge of the street and you have
a few buildings begin to give way. The road ends

01:31:47.732 --> 01:31:53.609
and there are bits of it that break off and fall
off the short cliffs into the water. There's the

01:31:53.609 --> 01:31:58.755
docking crane to your left on a bigger piece of
the dock that's out of the way, but it's blocking

01:31:58.755 --> 01:32:06.228
a lot of the view on this side. The ship that this
figure is focused on and the crates that he's by

01:32:06.228 --> 01:32:10.128
on one side. You get to the other and keeping
quiet. You don't think you've been noticed.

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:12.250
SAM: Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:14.077
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:32:14.518 --> 01:32:16.540
SAM: Perception check. Nine.

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.930
MARISHA: Ooh. Nine.

01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:19.432
SAM: Yes.

01:32:19.432 --> 01:32:22.378
MATT: You're waiting. Not much else seems to be
going on.

01:32:22.378 --> 01:32:28.549
SAM: (nervous chuckle) Great. Well, I'm ready. For
anything.

01:32:28.549 --> 01:32:30.185
MATT: Okay. You just sit there and wait?

01:32:30.185 --> 01:32:31.225
SAM: Yeah.

01:32:31.225 --> 01:32:32.782
MATT: Okay. The rest of you doing anything?

01:32:32.782 --> 01:32:37.107
LIAM: Yeah. While all that was happening I'm
halfway through, as a ritual spell, casting Find

01:32:37.107 --> 01:32:40.550
Familiar so I can change Frumpkin to something
else.

01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:42.548
MATT: Okay.

01:32:42.548 --> 01:32:44.287
LIAM: I'll tell you in a minute.

01:32:44.287 --> 01:32:51.722
MATT: Mmkay. You begin casting that. Caduceus, as
this is happening, there are a few of those torch

01:32:51.722 --> 01:33:00.179
poles set up and there's one at each dock nexus.
The one by that ship the light flickers out.

01:33:00.179 --> 01:33:01.917
MARISHA: Motherfuckers.

01:33:01.917 --> 01:33:04.465
TALIESIN: Well, that's a thing. You guys see that?

01:33:04.465 --> 01:33:05.396
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:33:05.396 --> 01:33:07.279
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:07.279 --> 01:33:10.901
MATT: You don't see that, and you're not close
enough to hear any of this. You see as a handful

01:33:10.901 --> 01:33:15.666
of figures seemed to have come out of that ship,
walked across the gangplank and put that

01:33:15.666 --> 01:33:17.365
torchlight out.

01:33:17.365 --> 01:33:20.854
TALIESIN: I think something's happening.

01:33:20.854 --> 01:33:22.978
LAURA: What do the figures look like?

01:33:22.978 --> 01:33:26.244
MATT: Make a perception check for you if you want
to glance, or are you asking Caduceus?

01:33:26.244 --> 01:33:27.766
LAURA: I want to look.

01:33:27.766 --> 01:33:29.744
TRAVIS: Pass that 26.

01:33:29.744 --> 01:33:32.263
LAURA: Yeah, right. I can't tell.

01:33:32.263 --> 01:33:34.263
(phone beeping)

01:33:34.263 --> 01:33:36.228
LIAM: Sorry, Laura.

01:33:36.228 --> 01:33:38.900
LAURA: I got a 14. I can't really tell.

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:42.089
MATT: She can't make out details and even from
this distance, you can't make out a bunch because

01:33:42.089 --> 01:33:49.114
they're all wearing either full cloaks or half
cloaks that end right about just past the elbow.

01:33:49.114 --> 01:33:59.191
Hoods up. Not uniform. Patchwork in color and
make, but they're all obscuring their features intentionally.

01:33:59.303 --> 01:34:01.509
TALIESIN: They look like pirates.

01:34:01.509 --> 01:34:03.704
TRAVIS: Should we go out and tell them we're
bearing gifts and shit?

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:12.018
MARISHA: I was just thinking that. I think maybe a
little bit of familiarity with some underground

01:34:12.018 --> 01:34:15.466
might help the situation.

01:34:15.466 --> 01:34:18.848
TRAVIS: Yeah. Tell them we're bearing gifts and we
want to see the captain, see what happens?

01:34:18.848 --> 01:34:20.015
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:34:20.015 --> 01:34:23.202
MARISHA: Okay. I'll go with you on that.

01:34:23.202 --> 01:34:24.654
TRAVIS: All right.

01:34:24.654 --> 01:34:32.880
MATT: Nott, you watch as the figure that's waiting
stands up, out of the spot, looks around, looks

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.402
that there's no zolezzo currently patrolling at
the moment and begins now to step onto the dock

01:34:37.402 --> 01:34:39.225
and walk towards the figures on the ship.

01:34:39.345 --> 01:34:41.674
SAM: Oh. I will trail behind.

01:34:41.674 --> 01:34:47.974
MATT: Okay. Goes and approaches. The figures,
there's now two that have stepped up to meet and

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:53.890
you can see now there are a few more that are
still in the ship that are watching from--

01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:56.779
MARISHA: How big is this ship? Is it like a <i>ship</i>
or like--?

01:34:56.779 --> 01:35:06.336
MATT: It's a fair size. I'd say from tip to end,
it's about 50 or so feet. Single sail, but a big sail.

01:35:06.491 --> 01:35:09.270
MARISHA: Any iconography on the sail?

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:18.082
MATT: It's currently furled up. It looks like it's
a ship that's designed for speed more than cargo,

01:35:18.082 --> 01:35:21.208
but it's a decent-sized ship.

01:35:21.208 --> 01:35:27.849
SAM: The layout of the dock, is the front of the
ship near the dock? Is it pulled up? Is it

01:35:27.849 --> 01:35:29.417
parallel parked?

01:35:29.417 --> 01:35:33.840
MATT: The dock, as you're walking, continues
forward and then it turns a little bit at an

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.121
angle, and there are other ships that are docked.
There's a smaller fishing ship on one side,

01:35:39.121 --> 01:35:45.110
there's a rowboat that's set off in the water
there. It's facing towards you at an angle and is

01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:50.475
currently anchored at the edge of where the dock
turns to the right. There is a gangplank set out

01:35:50.475 --> 01:35:54.544
between that and the dock where the figures are
stepping up. They're meeting right where that

01:35:54.544 --> 01:35:57.210
gangplank is and where that torch was snuffed.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:02.224
MARISHA: Hey, Fjord? You've got that fancy armor
that helps you float. Do you think maybe you could

01:36:02.224 --> 01:36:06.462
get underneath the docks? Overhear something?

01:36:06.462 --> 01:36:13.317
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like that. I'll run and-- staying
a good distance in-- I'll drop off the docks under

01:36:13.317 --> 01:36:15.737
the water and start swimming.

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:16.737
SAM: SEAL team.

01:36:16.737 --> 01:36:19.256
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a--

01:36:24.566 --> 01:36:26.895
How do I want to do this?

01:36:27.819 --> 01:36:29.895
SAM: That's your autobiography title!

01:36:29.895 --> 01:36:37.854
MATT: There you go. I walked into that one. Make
an acrobatics check for me, Fjord.

01:36:39.083 --> 01:36:41.445
MARISHA: No splash, no splash! Ten points!

01:36:41.445 --> 01:36:43.374
TRAVIS: Five.

01:36:43.374 --> 01:36:49.238
MATT: (splashing) The figures all of a sudden all
stop and turn, as well as the one who was talking,

01:36:49.238 --> 01:36:51.309
and they all look in your direction.

01:36:51.309 --> 01:36:53.916
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to make a dolphin sound.

01:36:53.916 --> 01:36:55.883
MARISHA: Yes, yes! Yes, queen, yes!

01:36:55.883 --> 01:36:57.340
SAM: Night dolphins!

01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:59.838
LAURA: (dolphin chittering)

01:37:00.028 --> 01:37:04.712
MATT: Thaumaturgy-- it's not so much an audio
mimicry spell, but you can make certain sounds

01:37:04.712 --> 01:37:09.145
happen, so I'll say roll a performance check.

01:37:09.145 --> 01:37:16.853
LAURA: Aww, seven.

01:37:16.853 --> 01:37:20.300
MATT: (unconvincing dolphin chittering)

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:24.010
(laughter)

01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:30.754
MATT: It seems to not assuage their fears and more
make them more worried and curious as to what's

01:37:30.754 --> 01:37:38.193
happening. You watch as the two figures there
start looking over towards the initial figure that

01:37:38.193 --> 01:37:45.424
you were following and are looking really
aggressive towards them. The figure's hands are up

01:37:45.424 --> 01:37:50.799
and are like-- (stammering). There's this heated
conversation going. The figures in the ship are

01:37:50.799 --> 01:37:57.613
getting things at the ready that you can't see,
but it looks like they are very much on guard. The

01:37:57.613 --> 01:38:03.769
two that were talking, one of them grabs the
scruff of the figure and holds him there, while

01:38:03.769 --> 01:38:08.443
the other one, blade drawn, begins to approach the
edge of the dock where that noise came from.

01:38:08.443 --> 01:38:17.202
MARISHA: I turn to Caleb and I go: There! I threw
our engagement ring and our life and I fed it to

01:38:17.202 --> 01:38:23.110
the rabies dolphins! It's over, okay?! It's over!

01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:24.750
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:28.464
LAURA: I like that your ring made a (loud
splashing).

01:38:28.464 --> 01:38:30.823
MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage.

01:38:30.823 --> 01:38:33.949
LIAM: Because Caleb is on the ground going--

01:38:33.949 --> 01:38:39.560
MARISHA: Deception with disadvantage. Okay, 11.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:49.218
MATT: As you give this display, the figure with
the sword out that was looking for the edge of the

01:38:49.218 --> 01:38:57.104
water where Fjord was looks over at you and goes--
with the little bit of features you can see a

01:38:57.104 --> 01:39:05.269
chin, a scruffy beard poking out beneath the hood,
still with the blade there, turns back, gives a

01:39:05.269 --> 01:39:07.519
hand motion towards the ship.

01:39:07.519 --> 01:39:14.113
TRAVIS: I didn't even ask: how far is the water
from the fucking dock? Five feet, or like 15 feet?

01:39:14.113 --> 01:39:18.347
Is it a tall dock?

01:39:18.347 --> 01:39:21.458
MATT: Oh, it's about ten foot.

01:39:21.458 --> 01:39:26.216
TRAVIS: Okay. Sweet, I can't even get out of this
water if I wanted to.

01:39:26.311 --> 01:39:28.199
MATT: You can climb up on the cliff if you need
to.

01:39:28.199 --> 01:39:30.138
LIAM: Also, has ten minutes gone by?

01:39:30.138 --> 01:39:35.627
MATT: No. When you started this, everyone was
going into the-- you're maybe three minutes.

01:39:35.627 --> 01:39:42.144
LIAM: You didn't correct me, but I said while Nott
was foofing around, so some time passed. Five, ten

01:39:42.144 --> 01:39:45.062
didn't, but you're the DM.

01:39:45.062 --> 01:39:49.921
SAM: While this is all going on, I'm going to cast
Message and send it to Caleb and say: There's

01:39:49.921 --> 01:39:57.008
something in the water! There's some argument
happening. Something's going horribly wrong,

01:39:57.008 --> 01:40:00.289
Caleb. We should get out of here! You can respond
to this message.

01:40:00.289 --> 01:40:04.835
MARISHA: My mom was right! I never should have
gotten involved with you.

01:40:04.835 --> 01:40:08.765
LIAM: I know that I am so close to the end of the
spell and I am going to push through.

01:40:08.765 --> 01:40:12.930
MARISHA: (Tracy voice) Look, this is why! Every time
I try to talk to you, you play with your toys.

01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:22.175
MATT: The figure gets within 15 feet of where
you're standing and says, "Hey! Piss off!"

01:40:22.175 --> 01:40:31.983
MARISHA: Hey, you know what? You piss off, okay?
I've had a rough day. I just wanted to be by

01:40:31.983 --> 01:40:33.668
myself near the ocean!

01:40:33.668 --> 01:40:43.359
MATT: Closes his fist. Three arrows get loosed
from the ship in your direction. That's a 14 to

01:40:43.359 --> 01:40:47.600
hit. Misses, I believe? That's a 19 to hit.

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.468
MARISHA: Hits.

01:40:49.468 --> 01:40:51.351
MATT: And another 19.

01:40:51.351 --> 01:40:53.302
MARISHA: Hits.

01:40:53.302 --> 01:40:54.240
LAURA: Run away, Tracy.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.178
MARISHA: (whispering) Never.

01:40:55.178 --> 01:40:58.751
MATT: That is seven points of damage.

01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:01.934
MARISHA: I'm going to Deflect Missiles.

01:41:01.934 --> 01:41:03.427
MATT: Go for it.

01:41:03.427 --> 01:41:06.863
MARISHA: What do I have to roll for that? Hang on,
sorry.

01:41:06.863 --> 01:41:09.757
MATT: It's 1d10 plus your monk level, isn't it?

01:41:09.757 --> 01:41:15.442
MARISHA: It's reaction, damage minus 1d10 plus my
monk level. It just happens, right?

01:41:15.442 --> 01:41:18.944
MATT: Yeah, you roll a d10 plus your monk level.

01:41:18.944 --> 01:41:21.563
MARISHA: Right, but my monk level is--

01:41:21.563 --> 01:41:22.580
MATT: Six.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:31.923
MARISHA: Yeah, so I'm good. I'm going to spend a
ki point to send it back at this guy. Yeah, this

01:41:31.923 --> 01:41:33.394
is happening.

01:41:33.394 --> 01:41:40.224
SAM: I love that she was having a fight with her
boyfriend with a giant owl on her shoulder.

01:41:40.224 --> 01:41:48.235
MARISHA: He's my rock. He's the only one who
understands me. Okay, I'm attacking. Natural 20.

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:55.441
MATT: Ooh, okay. Roll a d6 plus--

01:41:55.441 --> 01:42:00.320
MARISHA: I thought I got a d10. It's whatever the
bolt is, back at him.

01:42:00.873 --> 01:42:08.111
MATT: Right, the arrow is a d6 plus your dexterity
modifier.

01:42:08.111 --> 01:42:10.221
MARISHA: Plus my dex?

01:42:10.221 --> 01:42:18.173
MATT: I believe it's-- let me check the rules real
fast.

01:42:18.173 --> 01:42:20.413
MARISHA: Weapon damage, plus my dex.

01:42:20.413 --> 01:42:22.527
MATT: Yeah, it's a d6 plus your dex.

01:42:22.527 --> 01:42:23.765
MARISHA: Seven.

01:42:23.765 --> 01:42:30.672
MATT: Seven points of damage. You send one back,
you hear (pained grunt), but at a pretty decent

01:42:30.672 --> 01:42:36.291
distance. The other one that hit you, that's eight
points of damage.

01:42:36.291 --> 01:42:38.407
MARISHA: Deflect Missiles.

01:42:38.407 --> 01:42:44.214
MATT: That's a second ki point you spent.

01:42:44.214 --> 01:42:47.057
MARISHA: No, it's only a ki point when I send it
back.

01:42:47.057 --> 01:42:50.227
MATT: Right, but you've already used one reaction,
so you have to spend another ki point to get an

01:42:50.227 --> 01:42:51.305
additional reaction.

01:42:51.305 --> 01:42:53.833
MARISHA: Got you. I will do that.

01:42:53.833 --> 01:42:56.110
LAURA: Do you get ki points on short rests?

01:42:56.110 --> 01:43:01.471
MARISHA: Yes, I do. It was seven damage, you
said?

01:43:01.471 --> 01:43:02.716
MATT: Eight points.

01:43:02.716 --> 01:43:04.056
MARISHA: I take one point of damage.

01:43:04.056 --> 01:43:08.530
MATT: One point of piercing damage.

01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:15.747
MARISHA: I'm going to spend another ki point to
send this one back, too.

01:43:15.747 --> 01:43:17.272
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:43:17.272 --> 01:43:20.090
MARISHA: 17.

01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:22.604
MATT: Yeah.

01:43:22.604 --> 01:43:27.299
MARISHA: Ah! Eight damage.

01:43:27.299 --> 01:43:30.919
MATT: Is this to the guy that already took an
arrow, or to another? Because there were three of

01:43:30.919 --> 01:43:32.657
them that fired at you.

01:43:32.657 --> 01:43:35.015
MARISHA: Two at the guy who's closest to me.

01:43:35.015 --> 01:43:41.817
MATT: The same guy gets hit by both arrows. At
this point, the guy who had given the order sees

01:43:41.817 --> 01:43:48.660
you do this and his hand comes down, gives a quick
shout over his shoulder, "Come on! Take them out,

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.324
"they've seen too much!"

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:53.363
MARISHA: Hey, Caleb?

01:43:53.363 --> 01:43:54.806
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>?

01:43:54.806 --> 01:43:58.508
MARISHA: They don't think I'm a dumb, drunk bitch.
It didn't work.

01:43:58.508 --> 01:44:04.705
LIAM: Matt, before you run off for the thing, can
you describe as Caleb shakes his head out of what

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:09.075
he was doing, what do I see? I haven't paid
attention to any of that.

01:44:09.075 --> 01:44:10.433
MATT: That's what I'm about to show you.

01:44:10.433 --> 01:44:12.880
LIAM: It's going to all be in front of me? I love
this game.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:16.729
TALIESIN: It's as if he knew that this would go
horribly wrong.

01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:20.141
MARISHA: That this was going to be bad. Sorry,
guys. Sorry.

01:44:20.141 --> 01:44:21.578
TRAVIS: I'm disappointed in us.

01:44:21.578 --> 01:44:22.417
SAM: For what?

01:44:22.417 --> 01:44:25.783
TRAVIS: That was the most flounder-fucky sneak up
ever.

01:44:25.783 --> 01:44:28.576
LIAM: Belly-flop, shitty dolphin, Masterpiece
Theatre.

01:44:28.576 --> 01:44:31.067
MARISHA: We had bad rolls on important things!

01:44:31.067 --> 01:44:36.135
LIAM: Whoa! Holy fuck, this is the best map you've
ever made!

01:44:36.135 --> 01:44:38.234
TALIESIN: All worth it now!

01:44:38.234 --> 01:44:40.452
LAURA: Oh my god, it's so cool.

01:44:40.452 --> 01:44:46.561
ALL: Ooh!

01:44:46.561 --> 01:44:48.201
MATT: That is the figure.

01:44:48.201 --> 01:44:52.711
SAM: I feel like it's a misty night. It feels like
a misty night, don't you think?

01:44:52.711 --> 01:45:00.831
MATT: No, I think we're all right. So you guys
were-- Actually you should be a little further back.

01:45:00.831 --> 01:45:04.050
MARISHA: It feels like we should have figured this
out.

01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:06.824
LIAM: I assume Find Familiar has fizzled?

01:45:06.824 --> 01:45:10.255
TRAVIS: We should have walked up and said, "We've
come bearing gifts. Where is the captain?"

01:45:10.849 --> 01:45:12.143
SAM: That was the first idea.

01:45:12.143 --> 01:45:15.414
MARISHA: It was. Things started moving quickly.

01:45:15.414 --> 01:45:18.792
SAM: Oh, man, this is so cool.

01:45:18.792 --> 01:45:20.577
TALIESIN: This is so badass!

01:45:23.797 --> 01:45:26.337
LAURA: I hope they don't kill Marius.

01:45:26.337 --> 01:45:32.299
MARISHA: We could grab Marius and try and get the
fuck out.

01:45:32.299 --> 01:45:34.925
LIAM: It's a good thing we rested up and waited
until the following night, though.

01:45:34.925 --> 01:45:37.254
LAURA: Yeah, right? So good!

01:45:37.254 --> 01:45:50.674
MATT: Fjord, you are in the water right there.
Caduceus, Jester. Nott, you would have been hiding

01:45:50.674 --> 01:45:52.539
off to the other side of the dock here.

01:45:52.539 --> 01:45:54.743
SAM: Ooh, look at me, well-positioned.

01:45:54.743 --> 01:45:56.814
MATT: Caduceus, Jester?

01:45:56.814 --> 01:45:59.896
TALIESIN: Were we down over there, or--?

01:45:59.896 --> 01:46:07.485
LAURA: Yeah, hiding next to a building or
something. Crouching down, observing, right?

01:46:07.485 --> 01:46:14.062
MATT: You're keeping out of sight, best you can,
to watch this. Yasha-- whoever wants to run

01:46:14.312 --> 01:46:16.691
Yasha-- is going to be with you guys as well.

01:46:16.691 --> 01:46:18.925
TALIESIN: Do we have an iPad for that?

01:46:18.925 --> 01:46:22.572
MATT: We will, because we're going to take a break
before we jump into this, because it's nine

01:46:22.572 --> 01:46:32.963
o'clock. That'll give you guys a moment to figure
your shit out. We'll be right back, here. For this

01:46:32.963 --> 01:46:43.623
giveaway, while we're gone, by Wyrmwood, we have
here the-- oh, it's cherry wood! There's this nice

01:46:43.623 --> 01:46:49.292
little cherry wood piece here with the eastern sea
of the Euphoros Peninsula, drawn by our awesome

01:46:49.292 --> 01:46:57.234
friend Deven Rue. This is the full dice tower and
little dice box set. This will be going to one of

01:46:57.234 --> 01:47:05.107
you lucky winners out there. To enter this
tonight-- where did I put the sheet of paper?

01:47:05.107 --> 01:47:17.284
There it is. Somewhere in the vicinity. (laughs) I
was prepared and then it went away. Well, if I recall--

01:47:19.879 --> 01:47:21.108
TRAVIS: Code word?

01:47:21.108 --> 01:47:31.121
MATT: Yeah, my paper completely vanished. The code
word is marid. M-A-R-I-D, marid. M-A-R-I-D. Head

01:47:31.121 --> 01:47:36.305
over to the Critical Role Twitch chat to enter.
Enter it only once. Any more than that and you'll

01:47:36.305 --> 01:47:40.658
be disqualified. We'll come back with a winner
here in a moment. See you guys in a second.

01:47:40.658 --> 02:02:49.375
[break]

02:02:49.831 --> 02:02:55.611
MATT: Welcome back. Before we jump back in, we
have the winner. The winner is spraying_mantis.

02:02:55.611 --> 02:03:03.298
Spraying_mantis, congratulations, we'll get your
information and get your Wyrmwood victorious gift

02:03:03.298 --> 02:03:04.740
out to you ASAP.

02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:06.490
LIAM: Spraying_mantis would fit in at our table.

02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:10.728
MATT: Yeah. I need you all to roll initiative,
please.

02:03:10.728 --> 02:03:13.642
SAM: Initiative! Roll for initiative!

02:03:13.642 --> 02:03:15.284
TRAVIS: Do I roll for Yasha, too?

02:03:15.284 --> 02:03:16.798
MATT: Yes, if you don't mind.

02:03:16.798 --> 02:03:21.728
TALIESIN: I will roll. (shouting) No! No!

02:03:21.728 --> 02:03:23.210
SAM: I'd better roll for Laura.

02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:24.882
TALIESIN: You roll for Laura, because I
shouldn't.

02:03:24.882 --> 02:03:26.420
MARISHA: I'm going to add my boots.

02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:30.277
MATT: What'd you roll for you? All right, starting
at the top. 25 to 20?

02:03:30.277 --> 02:03:32.459
TRAVIS: I rolled a natural 20.

02:03:32.459 --> 02:03:33.168
MATT: Nice!

02:03:33.168 --> 02:03:35.516
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yasha rolled a two.

02:03:35.516 --> 02:03:37.042
SAM: Classic Ashley.

02:03:41.332 --> 02:03:42.985
TRAVIS: This is weird.

02:03:42.985 --> 02:03:45.085
MATT: 25 to 20? He's the only one?

02:03:45.143 --> 02:03:46.645
TRAVIS: I'm the only 20?

02:03:46.645 --> 02:03:49.510
MATT: Okay. 20 to 15?

02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:51.078
MARISHA: 16.

02:03:51.078 --> 02:03:52.374
SAM: 16 here as well.

02:03:52.374 --> 02:03:53.605
MATT: All right.

02:04:00.061 --> 02:04:03.998
Okay. 15 to ten?

02:04:03.998 --> 02:04:06.265
LIAM: <i>Zwölf</i>. 12.

02:04:07.063 --> 02:04:08.570
SAM: Jester has 13.

02:04:14.359 --> 02:04:16.959
This is Sparta!

02:04:17.493 --> 02:04:18.700
LIAM: Madness!

02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:20.970
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll see real fast.

02:04:21.013 --> 02:04:22.260
TALIESIN: Three.

02:04:22.504 --> 02:04:24.108
MATT: What did Yasha roll, again?

02:04:24.108 --> 02:04:28.325
TRAVIS: Two, plus whatever her initiative bonus
is, which I don't know.

02:04:28.325 --> 02:04:30.288
MARISHA: You, then Yasha?

02:04:30.288 --> 02:04:32.993
TALIESIN: I was about to say, we don't have her
iPad.

02:04:32.993 --> 02:04:35.439
SAM: We'll just make her last.

02:04:35.439 --> 02:04:39.607
MATT: I'd say it's a plus... let's say a plus
seven to hit. You know the rules for rage.

02:04:39.607 --> 02:04:40.954
TRAVIS: I do.

02:04:40.954 --> 02:04:45.927
MATT: We'll go with that. She does an
additional... You should probably pull up the

02:04:45.927 --> 02:04:48.989
stuff. That was something that should've done
during the break.

02:04:48.989 --> 02:04:51.794
SAM: Yeah, we said we were going to do that during
the break.

02:04:51.794 --> 02:04:56.325
MATT: Well, you did not. Now you don't have
Yasha's abilities. That's how it works out. Yasha

02:04:56.489 --> 02:05:01.907
will be doing some damage, if she gets there. All
right, so, top of the round. Fjord, in the middle

02:05:01.907 --> 02:05:07.041
of this chaos now breaking, the arrows being
flung, you are in the water and ten feet below the

02:05:07.041 --> 02:05:09.275
dock. What're you going to do?

02:05:09.275 --> 02:05:16.182
TRAVIS: All right. I'm going to use my bonus
action to use the single charge on Summer's Eve--

02:05:16.182 --> 02:05:22.050
doesn't use a spell slot-- to Misty Step from my
position in the water up to where Marius is.

02:05:22.050 --> 02:05:23.242
MATT: All right.

02:05:23.509 --> 02:05:25.081
SAM: Isn't Summer's Eve a douche?

02:05:25.081 --> 02:05:26.983
MARISHA: Yes, it is. I wasn't going to--

02:05:26.983 --> 02:05:29.466
TRAVIS: Summer's what? What's the name of the
sword?

02:05:29.466 --> 02:05:32.166
MARISHA: It's definitely for when your vajayjay
itches.

02:05:32.166 --> 02:05:35.096
MATT: Yeah, that's what it is. No, it's Summer's
Dance.

02:05:35.096 --> 02:05:36.441
TRAVIS: Summer's Dance!

02:05:36.441 --> 02:05:40.669
(laughter)

02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:44.198
TRAVIS: That's the best broadcast ever.

02:05:44.198 --> 02:05:46.278
MARISHA: Sponsor us, Summer's Eve!

02:05:46.278 --> 02:05:48.788
TRAVIS: Nope, it's Summer's Eve from now on.

02:05:48.788 --> 02:05:51.288
LIAM: Tell us about your patron, Fjord.

02:05:51.288 --> 02:05:55.087
(laughter)

02:05:55.087 --> 02:05:57.395
MARISHA: He smells of lavender and vanilla.

02:05:57.395 --> 02:05:59.192
TRAVIS: Oh my god, amazing.

02:05:59.192 --> 02:06:02.424
MATT: I love it. What is the--

02:06:02.424 --> 02:06:03.984
TRAVIS: 30 feet.

02:06:03.984 --> 02:06:07.430
MATT: Well, I was going to say, the Misty Step, is
it on a short rest or a long rest that it gets back?

02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:09.536
TRAVIS: It is every short or long rest.

02:06:09.536 --> 02:06:11.408
MATT: Gotcha, perfect.

02:06:11.408 --> 02:06:19.946
TRAVIS: With my action, I will use Thunder Step.
Well, I'll reach out and grab towards Marius and

02:06:19.946 --> 02:06:25.376
say, come with us, and cast Thunder Step. He has
to be willing to come with.

02:06:25.376 --> 02:06:28.623
MATT: All right, make a persuasion check with
disadvantage.

02:06:28.623 --> 02:06:30.094
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

02:06:30.094 --> 02:06:35.529
MATT: Yeah! Because you literally showed up,
ruined this whole deal he was about to make.

02:06:36.231 --> 02:06:38.391
LIAM: Come on, Fjordy.

02:06:38.391 --> 02:06:39.768
TRAVIS: That's a natural one.

02:06:39.768 --> 02:06:41.539
LIAM: (groans)

02:06:41.539 --> 02:06:42.861
MATT: He's not willing.

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:44.996
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

02:06:44.996 --> 02:06:46.903
SAM: Is he the redhead there?

02:06:46.903 --> 02:06:48.248
LIAM: Yes, he's puffy pants.

02:06:48.248 --> 02:06:50.848
TRAVIS: Does it cancel out the spell or does it
still happen and he just doesn't come with?

02:06:50.848 --> 02:06:52.794
MATT: The spell still happens, he just doesn't
come with.

02:06:52.794 --> 02:06:56.153
TRAVIS: Well, that didn't work. I will--

02:06:56.153 --> 02:06:58.645
LAURA: Can you talk to him before you Thunder Step
back?

02:06:58.645 --> 02:07:00.310
MATT: He tried.

02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:03.314
TRAVIS: I did. I rolled a natural one. It was
great. He didn't want to come.

02:07:03.314 --> 02:07:04.914
TALIESIN: This is going great.

02:07:04.914 --> 02:07:06.965
TRAVIS: Yep. Par for the fucking course.

02:07:06.965 --> 02:07:08.661
LIAM: On brand.

02:07:08.661 --> 02:07:10.635
TRAVIS: Can I make it over to this dock over
here?

02:07:10.635 --> 02:07:12.340
MATT: How long is the--

02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:13.562
TRAVIS: 90 feet.

02:07:13.562 --> 02:07:19.405
MATT: 90 feet? Most likely, yeah. You have to
count it out. Yeah, easily, you can make it

02:07:19.405 --> 02:07:21.364
anywhere on that dock, pretty much.

02:07:21.364 --> 02:07:23.535
TALIESIN: That's 90 nautical feet.

02:07:25.105 --> 02:07:28.396
TRAVIS: That's 3d10 thunder damage.

02:07:33.224 --> 02:07:38.400
(counting) Eight points of thunder damage, woo.

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.057
MATT: Well, it doesn't kill Marius, that's good.

02:07:40.057 --> 02:07:42.089
TRAVIS: That's good.

02:07:42.089 --> 02:07:49.488
MATT: All right, so there's this blast, this loud
thunderous sound, which may have gotten the

02:07:49.488 --> 02:07:53.112
attention of a nearby zolezzo or two.

02:07:53.112 --> 02:07:54.748
SAM: Oh boy.

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:58.945
TRAVIS: Oh god. Where's the reset button?

02:08:00.321 --> 02:08:02.020
LAURA: Where's the save point?

02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:04.322
MARISHA: Yeah, can we load the latest save file?

02:08:04.322 --> 02:08:06.856
TRAVIS: Can we reach in the SNES, push the game up
and down?

02:08:06.856 --> 02:08:10.108
MATT: There's none in view currently, so you don't
know, it could be a while until one of them shows

02:08:10.108 --> 02:08:17.006
up. You get the sense that that was a loud noise,
because it's a Thunder Step. That ends your turn?

02:08:17.006 --> 02:08:19.555
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you can hear it within 300 feet,
so.

02:08:19.555 --> 02:08:26.777
MATT: Yeah. That ends your turn. That brings us
now to the bowmen. The bowmen, who--

02:08:26.777 --> 02:08:30.847
TRAVIS: Right here, put me out of my misery.

02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:35.498
MATT: No, actually. You showed up and made a
(poof), but they don't know where you showed up.

02:08:35.498 --> 02:08:36.997
You just vanished out of sight.

02:08:36.997 --> 02:08:38.480
TRAVIS: Because I was behind them, yeah.

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:43.622
MATT: They're all going to focus on... On the one
they were already told to fire at, so they're all

02:08:43.622 --> 02:08:50.230
going to aim at Beau. That's going to be--
Actually, they had a hard time with you and you

02:08:50.230 --> 02:08:53.568
threw it back, so only one of them's going to fire
on you. The other two are going to fire at Caleb.

02:08:54.599 --> 02:08:56.439
Against Beau, that is--

02:08:56.439 --> 02:08:59.687
MARISHA: Can I try and like self-defense--defend
Caleb?

02:08:59.687 --> 02:09:00.807
SAM: Secret service?

02:09:00.807 --> 02:09:01.978
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:09:02.184 --> 02:09:03.272
MATT: 20 to hit.

02:09:03.272 --> 02:09:04.408
MARISHA: Hits.

02:09:04.408 --> 02:09:10.006
LIAM: I think I cast Mage Armor before going down
to the Sluice, but how much later is it? Is it

02:09:10.006 --> 02:09:12.010
beyond eight hours?

02:09:12.017 --> 02:09:17.398
MATT: At this point it's midnight. You guys went
there mid-afternoon, so it's been... Yeah, it's

02:09:17.398 --> 02:09:23.128
been past eight hours. That is four points of
damage to you, Beauregard.

02:09:23.128 --> 02:09:25.414
MARISHA: Zero points of damage to me.

02:09:25.414 --> 02:09:28.228
MATT: All righty. Then two attacks against you
Caleb.

02:09:28.689 --> 02:09:30.063
MARISHA: I can't like--

02:09:30.063 --> 02:09:31.730
MATT: Both are 15.

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:35.845
LIAM: Well, I'll cast Shield. So they miss.

02:09:35.845 --> 02:09:38.916
MATT: They both splinter off of you, no issue.

02:09:38.916 --> 02:09:41.745
LAURA: Who am I after in the initiative?

02:09:41.745 --> 02:09:46.838
MATT: You are after Beau and Nott, then other
characters go, and then your turn.

02:09:46.838 --> 02:09:48.616
LAURA: Okay.

02:09:48.616 --> 02:09:51.770
MATT: They're going to go ahead and-- This guy's
going to move up to the side here to get a better

02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:56.400
view of you. This guy's going to shift off to the
side. This guy's going to move up to the top to

02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:02.033
get a better view as well. The one that's moving
by is going to be like, "Quick, quick!" and he's

02:10:02.033 --> 02:10:08.797
like shouting down into the door that leads deeper
into the ship underneath the ladder right there.

02:10:08.797 --> 02:10:11.066
That brings us to Beau and Nott's turn.

02:10:11.066 --> 02:10:12.274
SAM: Take it away.

02:10:12.274 --> 02:10:14.978
MARISHA: You want to try to take out this guy in
front of me first, with your sneak attack, or do

02:10:14.978 --> 02:10:16.752
you want me to lean in on him?

02:10:16.752 --> 02:10:17.952
SAM: I mean... this big guy?

02:10:17.952 --> 02:10:19.290
MARISHA: The big guy that you're under.

02:10:19.290 --> 02:10:23.724
SAM: I mean, I can certainly try. I don't want
people to see me, but sure.

02:10:23.724 --> 02:10:28.319
MARISHA: Well, I could try to take him out, if you
want to try and go for someone else.

02:10:28.319 --> 02:10:33.471
SAM: You do your thing first. You just do your
thing first and I'll see where the chips fall.

02:10:33.471 --> 02:10:36.036
Also, Matt, which guy is our guy? The red?

02:10:36.036 --> 02:10:37.341
LIAM : The red.

02:10:37.341 --> 02:10:38.738
MATT: This guy is Marius.

02:10:38.738 --> 02:10:40.468
MARISHA: I shouldn't try anything fancy, right?

02:10:40.468 --> 02:10:42.972
LAURA: I think we should get the fuck out.

02:10:42.972 --> 02:10:45.750
MATT: Beau, it's your turn. What are you doing?

02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:49.112
MARISHA: I'm going to go up to this guy.

02:10:49.112 --> 02:10:52.082
MATT: Right here? All right, so you rush up to
him.

02:10:52.082 --> 02:10:53.552
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:10:56.729 --> 02:10:58.495
I'm going to attack him.

02:10:58.495 --> 02:11:00.526
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

02:11:02.556 --> 02:11:04.929
MARISHA: I don't know what to do. 12.

02:11:04.929 --> 02:11:10.047
MATT: 12 misses. You punch short. You swing and it
hits, but it hits his heavy splint armor and hurts

02:11:10.047 --> 02:11:14.748
your knuckles a bit, and he takes it. Now that
you're up in his face, you can see he's a big,

02:11:14.748 --> 02:11:21.982
imposing half-orc and currently looks to not feel
very threatened by you. That was your first attack.

02:11:22.879 --> 02:11:24.502
MARISHA: Hmm, going to try again.

02:11:24.502 --> 02:11:27.229
TRAVIS: We are missing a long rest. We could just
get the fuck out of here.

02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:33.327
MARISHA: Yeah, but I don't know what I want to do,
though. Waiting for everybody else to run. 17.

02:11:33.327 --> 02:11:34.734
MATT: 17 just hits.

02:11:34.734 --> 02:11:37.628
TRAVIS. <i>17</i> just hits.

02:11:37.628 --> 02:11:38.983
SAM: Ooh, boy.

02:11:38.983 --> 02:11:42.796
MARISHA: Fuck, I think I was actually using the
wrong math on that last one, too, but that's okay.

02:11:44.206 --> 02:11:44.874
Okay.

02:11:46.846 --> 02:11:48.341
Fuck me, six damage.

02:11:48.341 --> 02:11:49.907
MATT: Six points of damage, all right.

02:11:49.907 --> 02:11:51.744
MARISHA: I'm going to try to Stunning Strike him.

02:11:51.744 --> 02:11:58.827
MATT: All right! That's a 17; 15 plus two on a
constitution save. So Stunning Strike, no effect,

02:11:58.827 --> 02:12:00.857
unfortunately.

02:12:00.857 --> 02:12:02.818
MARISHA: Cool, supes cool.

02:12:02.818 --> 02:12:04.893
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

02:12:04.893 --> 02:12:15.184
MARISHA: Yes, I do. I'm going to-- I can always
disengage and run; I'm fast as fuck-- spend

02:12:15.184 --> 02:12:18.598
another ki point to do Patient Defense and hold my
ground.

02:12:18.598 --> 02:12:20.814
MATT: Okay. You got it.

02:12:20.814 --> 02:12:23.214
MARISHA: Everyone else, please run.

02:12:23.214 --> 02:12:25.051
MATT: Nott?

02:12:25.051 --> 02:12:33.200
SAM: I'm going to look up above me and-- wait, he
doesn't see me yet, I think?

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:35.179
MATT: As far as you know, he doesn't see you.

02:12:35.179 --> 02:12:43.876
SAM: Okay, so I'm going to scuttle away from him
across to that other box over there, across the

02:12:43.876 --> 02:12:51.455
dock there. And, as I'm running, I'll turn around
and fire once at the big guy. Still sneak attack

02:12:51.455 --> 02:12:54.048
because Marisha's engaged, right?

02:12:54.048 --> 02:12:55.842
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:12:55.842 --> 02:12:58.692
SAM: That is a 24 to hit!

02:12:58.692 --> 02:13:00.732
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
sneak attack damage.

02:13:00.732 --> 02:13:01.780
SAM: Yeah!

02:13:06.834 --> 02:13:11.331
(counting) 21 points of damage!

02:13:11.331 --> 02:13:18.396
MATT: 21 points of damage. You watch as he goes
from this arrogant, watching you flounder in front

02:13:18.396 --> 02:13:23.916
of him as he takes the blows and keeps grinning,
suddenly double over as the bolt is now deeply

02:13:23.916 --> 02:13:31.083
buried into his abdomen. Yeah, that was a pretty
tough hit. He's hurt!

02:13:31.083 --> 02:13:34.050
SAM: Then I will, bonus action, jump in that
box--

02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:35.419
(laughter)

02:13:35.419 --> 02:13:36.857
SAM: --and hide.

02:13:36.857 --> 02:13:38.584
MARISHA: Oh, that's so cute.

02:13:38.584 --> 02:13:39.948
MATT: (laughs) Roll a stealth check.

02:13:39.948 --> 02:13:41.520
MARISHA: Assassin's Creed.

02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:48.036
SAM: Ooh. Oh, wait, that's better than I thought.
It's 19. I'm wearing my thing, my hood. Do I get

02:13:48.036 --> 02:13:49.593
to roll again for stealth?

02:13:49.593 --> 02:13:50.836
MATT: Yeah, you do.

02:13:50.836 --> 02:13:52.505
LAURA: Oh, you already get advantage?

02:13:52.505 --> 02:13:55.668
SAM: Still 19. Yes, you double-advantaged me.

02:13:55.668 --> 02:13:57.038
LAURA: What a stupid...

02:13:57.038 --> 02:14:01.555
MATT: (laughs) Now you know. All right, that ends
your guys' go. It is now the Enforcers' turn.

02:14:01.555 --> 02:14:03.729
SAM: <i>The Enforcer!</i>

02:14:03.729 --> 02:14:11.989
MATT: One Enforcer comes out of the center of the
ship and looks and sees this going. The guy up top

02:14:11.989 --> 02:14:14.422
goes, "Quick, burn it all!"

02:14:14.422 --> 02:14:15.664
MARISHA: <i>What?</i>

02:14:15.664 --> 02:14:19.458
MATT: This guy is going to go ahead and jump back
down into the ship.

02:14:19.458 --> 02:14:23.574
SAM: Burn it all? Ooh, they're carrying weed.

02:14:23.574 --> 02:14:25.175
(laughter)

02:14:25.175 --> 02:14:28.886
SAM: They think we're customs and they're going to
burn it!

02:14:28.886 --> 02:14:32.853
MATT: That Enforcer's going to pull out a hand
crossbow and is going to go ahead and take a shot

02:14:32.853 --> 02:14:38.086
at you, since you're off in that way. Has
disadvantage on the attack, but you're--right now--

02:14:38.254 --> 02:14:39.148
TRAVIS: He does?

02:14:39.148 --> 02:14:43.915
MATT: Because you're out of his range. He's going
to go ahead and grab and pull Marius towards the

02:14:43.915 --> 02:14:48.177
gang plank. He's going to go ahead and fire at
you.

02:14:50.492 --> 02:14:52.253
That's 15 to hit?

02:14:52.253 --> 02:14:53.194
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:14:53.194 --> 02:14:59.191
MATT: Misses, yeah. You (bash) with your shield.
Ricochets off, no issue. That's going to be the

02:14:59.191 --> 02:15:00.889
end of the Enforcers' turn. Jester, you're up.

02:15:00.889 --> 02:15:08.713
LAURA: Okay. Am I within 60 feet of this guy?

02:15:09.487 --> 02:15:13.699
MATT: You look like you're-- it's close.

02:15:14.015 --> 02:15:22.182
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to step forward a little
bit. There, there... sure.

02:15:22.182 --> 02:15:27.938
MATT: Okay. (counting) Yeah, he's within 60 feet.

02:15:27.938 --> 02:15:34.263
LAURA: Okay I'm going to cast Hold Person at third
level on both him and him.

02:15:34.263 --> 02:15:37.363
MATT and SAM: Ooh!

02:15:37.363 --> 02:15:43.727
MATT: All right. He-- the guy with Marius-- rolls
a natural 17. The guy next to Beau rolls a natural

02:15:43.753 --> 02:15:45.052
three.

02:15:45.052 --> 02:15:47.386
LAURA: Okay, well, he's paralyzed.

02:15:47.386 --> 02:15:49.548
MATT: (singing) Paralyzed.

02:15:51.168 --> 02:15:54.380
SAM: (singing) Para. Para. Paralyzed.

02:15:54.504 --> 02:16:00.995
MATT: You are currently concentrating there. The
big guy with the bolt in his stomach goes (groans)

02:16:00.995 --> 02:16:06.463
and his whole body locks up and you can see his
eyes go wild as he glances down at you, unable to

02:16:06.463 --> 02:16:10.327
move at all. Does that finish your turn? You can
keep moving the rest of your movement if you want to.

02:16:10.552 --> 02:16:16.912
LAURA: I'm going to back up and try to get around
that building if I can.

02:16:16.912 --> 02:16:18.215
MATT: Around here, you mean?

02:16:18.215 --> 02:16:19.590
LAURA: No, around the back of it.

02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:25.159
MATT: Okay. (counting) 25, 30. That's as far as
you can get with your movement. All right, that

02:16:25.159 --> 02:16:27.931
ends your go. That brings us to Caleb.

02:16:27.931 --> 02:16:37.397
LIAM: Yeah, okay. I start moving my hand in an
arcane motion and I reach back at that building

02:16:37.397 --> 02:16:45.848
over to my side there, and a crate full of food, a
wooden crate, starts to jiggle and rockets through

02:16:45.848 --> 02:16:51.886
the air at the held fool in front of Beauregard.
I'm casting Catapult at third level.

02:16:52.245 --> 02:16:53.986
SAM: Food fight!

02:16:53.986 --> 02:16:56.212
(laughter)

02:16:56.212 --> 02:17:01.151
LIAM: He automatically fails his dex save because
he is paralyzed. 5d8.

02:17:01.151 --> 02:17:04.268
SAM: 5d8 fruit damage?!

02:17:04.405 --> 02:17:12.090
MATT: Yep, from lobbing this stack of fruits and
heavy wooden boxes into his head.

02:17:12.090 --> 02:17:14.334
MARISHA: It was a drive-by fruiting.

02:17:14.334 --> 02:17:22.044
LIAM: A couple things. 30 points of damage. That's
a transmutation spell, so I can shuttle a little

02:17:22.044 --> 02:17:26.919
bit of arcane energy into my Transmuter's Stone,
and I'm going to change its property from dark

02:17:26.919 --> 02:17:32.509
vision into advantage on concentration checks. I'm
going to back the fuck up towards that house, as

02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:33.910
far as I can go.

02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:35.852
SAM: Wow. Wizards.

02:17:35.852 --> 02:17:40.979
MATT: All right. As the crates slam into him, the
body rocks back for a minute, but is still holding

02:17:40.979 --> 02:17:45.169
itself in place. Right now there's splinters of
wood sticking out of his armor, his jaw is all

02:17:45.169 --> 02:17:54.869
messed up. The hood gets blown back and you can
see the grayish hair that's tangled and sea

02:17:54.869 --> 02:18:00.981
air-matted that is now streaked with blood from
the impact. Bits of his face are covered in gore.

02:18:00.981 --> 02:18:03.254
He's looking pretty hurt.

02:18:03.254 --> 02:18:05.248
MARISHA: This guy's real beefy, though.

02:18:05.248 --> 02:18:10.734
MATT: He's also taken a rough round. This has not
gone well.

02:18:10.734 --> 02:18:13.120
MARISHA: Yeah, but we don't want to fight all of
them.

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.518
MATT: All right, so Caleb, that ends your turn?

02:18:15.518 --> 02:18:16.559
LIAM: Yeah.

02:18:16.559 --> 02:18:21.609
MATT: It's now the captain's turn... who is
paralyzed. His really, really cool round that he

02:18:21.609 --> 02:18:27.275
was going to do that was going to be really
awesome doesn't happen because he's fighting

02:18:27.275 --> 02:18:30.080
against the spell. He's going to make his save.

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:32.280
SAM: Why do we have to run? Seems like we're
winning.

02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:33.686
TALIESIN: There's more of them.

02:18:33.686 --> 02:18:35.442
SAM: They're burning marijuana.

02:18:35.442 --> 02:18:37.376
MARISHA: What are they burning, though?

02:18:37.376 --> 02:18:40.929
LAURA: We could've found out if we wouldn't have
been stupid.

02:18:40.929 --> 02:18:44.058
LIAM: There's five people we can see, one dude in
the boat down below.

02:18:44.058 --> 02:18:47.396
MATT: He's going to make a wisdom save to see if
he can resist the--

02:18:47.396 --> 02:18:49.168
SAM: There's like nine of us.

02:18:49.628 --> 02:18:53.131
MATT: That's a 12. He did not save. He's still
held.

02:18:53.279 --> 02:18:54.503
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:18:55.336 --> 02:18:57.368
MATT: All right. That brings us to Caduceus.

02:18:57.368 --> 02:19:00.401
TALIESIN: Oh boy, that is a lot happening.

02:19:00.401 --> 02:19:03.454
TRAVIS: Boil their flesh, Caduceus, let's go. Do
it. Bring it.

02:19:03.454 --> 02:19:14.108
TALIESIN: All right let's-- yeah, this'll be fun.
That's all taken care of. I'm going to cast a--

02:19:18.688 --> 02:19:20.490
Guiding Bolt, I guess?

02:19:20.712 --> 02:19:22.106
MATT: Okay, towards?

02:19:22.106 --> 02:19:27.374
TALIESIN: Towards the guy standing next to-- the
guy standing next to Marius.

02:19:27.486 --> 02:19:32.143
MATT: All right, go ahead and make the ranged
attack roll. You're casting it at first level?

02:19:32.143 --> 02:19:33.166
TALIESIN: First level.

02:19:33.166 --> 02:19:34.490
MATT: All right.

02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:40.134
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a-- what is the ranged
attack on that?

02:19:40.134 --> 02:19:42.986
MATT: Guiding Bolt, I think, is 120 feet. I think
it's pretty far.

02:19:42.986 --> 02:19:46.387
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, it's very far. Just a ranged
attack.

02:19:49.273 --> 02:19:50.490
23 to hit.

02:19:50.490 --> 02:19:51.966
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

02:19:52.210 --> 02:19:53.366
TALIESIN: 25.

02:19:53.366 --> 02:19:54.915
MATT: He's only wearing leather armor.

02:19:54.915 --> 02:20:03.474
TALIESIN: I'm at 51 hit points. I'm fine. Oh yeah,
so that's-- where is that? 4d6, okay.

02:20:13.095 --> 02:20:15.296
Ooh! 15 points of damage.

02:20:15.564 --> 02:20:16.497
MATT: Nice!

02:20:16.497 --> 02:20:17.718
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:20:17.718 --> 02:20:22.836
MATT: The bolt hits him and and you see now this
vibrant glow as the impact-- the energy forms

02:20:22.836 --> 02:20:26.439
around his chest, creating this beacon. The next
attack against that Enforcer right on the

02:20:26.439 --> 02:20:33.627
gangplank has advantage. He's pretty visibly hurt.
He's not on his last legs or anything, but he's

02:20:33.627 --> 02:20:35.325
taken some wear and tear.

02:20:35.325 --> 02:20:36.861
TALIESIN: I'm going to vanish.

02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:38.696
SAM: You can do that?

02:20:38.696 --> 02:20:39.946
TALIESIN: I can do that.

02:20:39.946 --> 02:20:41.255
MATT: As a bonus action?

02:20:41.255 --> 02:20:45.970
TALIESIN: I believe so. I'm double-checking. I can
do Hidden Step as a bonus action.

02:20:45.970 --> 02:20:47.320
MATT: Go for it.

02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:55.589
SAM: So many steps. Misty, hidden, thunder.

02:20:57.217 --> 02:21:06.470
TALIESIN: I'm going to move off in that direction,
if that's okay.

02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:07.782
MATT: Full movement?

02:21:07.782 --> 02:21:09.725
TALIESIN: Let's go full movement.

02:21:09.725 --> 02:21:14.463
MATT: There? Okay, there you go. You are not
visible at the moment. That finishes Caduceus'

02:21:14.463 --> 02:21:16.057
turn. Yasha's up.

02:21:16.057 --> 02:21:20.068
TRAVIS: Yasha, seeing all these arrows fly at
Beau, she would like to rage.

02:21:20.068 --> 02:21:21.302
MATT: Understood.

02:21:21.302 --> 02:21:24.935
TRAVIS: She will rush up next to Beau towards the
half-orc captain.

02:21:24.935 --> 02:21:27.135
LIAM: Sentinel babes.

02:21:27.135 --> 02:21:28.936
MATT: Easy enough to do.

02:21:28.936 --> 02:21:31.354
TRAVIS: Beautiful. She will make-- does she get
two attacks?

02:21:31.354 --> 02:21:32.837
MATT: She does. She gets two.

02:21:32.837 --> 02:21:35.245
TRAVIS: Two reckless attacks against the half
orc.

02:21:35.245 --> 02:21:39.198
MATT: I mean, you can. Go for it. She has
advantage on him, because he's paralyzed.

02:21:39.198 --> 02:21:42.607
TRAVIS: Oh! Then we'll make it regular so that he
doesn't get advantage back.

02:21:42.607 --> 02:21:47.681
LAURA: Doesn't everybody get advantage on attacks
against her, too? That would suck with the arrows.

02:21:47.681 --> 02:21:49.053
TRAVIS: Only the person you attack.

02:21:49.053 --> 02:21:49.953
LAURA: Oh, really?

02:21:49.953 --> 02:21:51.487
MATT: No, reckless, any attacks against you.

02:21:51.487 --> 02:21:52.998
TRAVIS: Any attacks against you.

02:21:52.998 --> 02:21:55.526
MATT: Yeah. It's been a while since you've been
reckless. It's fine.

02:21:55.654 --> 02:21:57.880
TRAVIS: Been a while! That's a... 19?

02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:00.875
MATT: That hits and that is an auto-crit because
he's paralyzed.

02:22:00.875 --> 02:22:03.847
TRAVIS: Ooh. The second one is a 12.

02:22:03.847 --> 02:22:08.131
MATT: 12 does not hit. Unfortunately.

02:22:08.131 --> 02:22:11.862
TRAVIS: She rolls-- what is it, 2d6, maybe?

02:22:12.017 --> 02:22:14.059
MATT: For her, as a--

02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:17.575
LIAM: She's going to carve him like a Thanksgiving
turkey.

02:22:17.575 --> 02:22:35.658
MATT: Yeah, that's going to be bad for him. This
is for the zealot. There we go. The first hit

02:22:35.658 --> 02:22:43.152
equals 1d6 plus half your-- okay, so it's 2d6 plus
six damage.

02:22:45.325 --> 02:22:46.558
TRAVIS: 15.

02:22:46.558 --> 02:22:49.204
MATT: The dice are doubled. Plus an additional
d6.

02:22:49.204 --> 02:22:54.678
TRAVIS: 18 plus six is 24, plus an additional d6.

02:22:54.678 --> 02:22:56.109
MATT: That's doubled.

02:22:56.109 --> 02:22:58.744
TRAVIS: That's two. What did I say?

02:22:58.744 --> 02:23:00.779
MATT: 26, I think?

02:23:00.779 --> 02:23:02.020
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:23:02.020 --> 02:23:06.449
MATT: That's 28 plus six for her barbarian level.
Yeah, she just eviscerates him.

02:23:06.449 --> 02:23:08.179
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:23:08.179 --> 02:23:16.274
MATT: Man. As he's there, frozen in place, Yasha's
rushed up and cleaves right through his chest, and

02:23:16.274 --> 02:23:22.510
you watch as he folds into two pieces, both
tumbling off into the water. There's now two

02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:26.283
halves of the orc floating in the water below.

02:23:26.283 --> 02:23:28.211
TRAVIS: "You okay?"

02:23:28.211 --> 02:23:29.862
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:23:29.862 --> 02:23:31.435
(laughter)

02:23:31.435 --> 02:23:33.240
MARISHA: Wow, Yasha. Man.

02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:34.412
MATT: All right. Fjord, you're up.

02:23:34.412 --> 02:23:35.684
LIAM: Another layer of insanity.

02:23:35.842 --> 02:23:37.026
TRAVIS: Oh, it's me?

02:23:37.026 --> 02:23:39.128
MARISHA: Just fucked my head even more.

02:23:40.224 --> 02:23:47.027
TRAVIS: You know what? Fuck it. I'll use my last
spell slot to cast Hypnotic Pattern. I will make

02:23:47.027 --> 02:23:53.600
it in the shape of the cat's eye sphere above the
ship so that everyone can see it.

02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:56.566
LAURA: Hypnotic Pattern? What is that?

02:23:56.610 --> 02:23:58.078
TRAVIS: It's brand new.

02:23:58.078 --> 02:24:06.083
MATT: Yeah, that'll get-- you can't get everybody
in the ship. You'd be missing either the guy at

02:24:06.083 --> 02:24:08.313
the front or the guy at the back. Which one do you
want to--?

02:24:08.313 --> 02:24:09.980
TRAVIS: I'll miss the guy at the back.

02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:12.653
MATT: Okay, so the front, then. That's a wisdom
saving throw.

02:24:12.653 --> 02:24:15.456
TRAVIS: Yes. 15 is the save.

02:24:15.456 --> 02:24:22.528
MATT: That is a 15. 13 plus two. The guy at the
front resists. Next guy behind him: natural 16

02:24:22.528 --> 02:24:35.477
plus two. He resists. The guy next to Marius
fails, and Marius fails. You watch as both Marius

02:24:35.477 --> 02:24:43.413
and the Enforcer standing on the gangplank, their
faces immediately go dull as they stare up at

02:24:43.413 --> 02:24:48.019
this-- what you see as nothing. You have no visual
perspective on what's happening, but suddenly they

02:24:48.019 --> 02:24:53.517
both go slack-jawed and stand staring up in the
air at this empty space.

02:24:53.517 --> 02:24:58.305
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're incapacitated. Their speed
is zero. But if they take damage or if someone

02:24:58.305 --> 02:25:02.324
else uses an action to shake the creature out of
their stupor, then they (confused noises).

02:25:02.324 --> 02:25:04.664
MARISHA: You just spiked their drinks, basically.

02:25:04.664 --> 02:25:07.804
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've bascially Thundercat Ho'd the
eye up into the--

02:25:07.804 --> 02:25:11.540
MATT: Yeah, kind of. All right, so that's your
action?

02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:13.054
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:25:13.054 --> 02:25:14.514
MATT: Anything with your movement?

02:25:19.084 --> 02:25:21.923
TRAVIS: Nope, I'll come over here.

02:25:22.084 --> 02:25:26.067
MATT: All right. You make your way to the edge of
the dock right there. Perfect. All right, that

02:25:26.067 --> 02:25:36.272
ends your turn. It's now the bowmen's turn. Seeing
you now casting the spell, making a ruckus on the

02:25:36.272 --> 02:25:43.689
dock nearby, all three of them turn to face you.
This guy's going to go ahead and shift over and

02:25:43.689 --> 02:25:46.397
get a bit closer to the edge, and all three of
them are going to fire at you, Fjord.

02:25:46.397 --> 02:25:47.893
SAM: Oh no!

02:25:47.893 --> 02:25:49.685
MARISHA: What if we commandeered the ship?

02:25:49.685 --> 02:25:51.657
SAM: Yeah! Become pirates.

02:25:51.657 --> 02:25:53.154
MATT: Natural 20 on the first hit.

02:25:53.154 --> 02:25:55.686
MARISHA: What if we don't commandeer the ship?

02:25:55.686 --> 02:25:59.128
TALIESIN: 25, 30. I'm within 30 feet of--

02:25:59.128 --> 02:26:00.523
MATT: Of none of them.

02:26:00.523 --> 02:26:04.190
TALIESIN: None of them? I've got to be them, not
Fjord, right? Okay, never mind. I'll

02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:05.458
double-check.

02:26:05.458 --> 02:26:11.968
MATT: Double-check that just in case. The next hit
against you is 17 plus four.

02:26:11.968 --> 02:26:13.924
TRAVIS: That hits. 17 is my armor class.

02:26:13.924 --> 02:26:15.609
TALIESIN: Suffers a critical hit.

02:26:15.609 --> 02:26:19.274
MATT: Oh, suffers? You can remove that. Okay, and
that's a natural 17 plus four.

02:26:19.274 --> 02:26:20.442
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:26:20.442 --> 02:26:24.251
MATT: All three hit you. The crit is not a crit
thanks to Caduceus.

02:26:28.137 --> 02:26:30.533
That's going to be six points

02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:36.272
of piercing damage, seven points of piercing
damage, and seven points of piercing damage.

02:26:36.661 --> 02:26:41.571
(arrows impacting) They're going to go ahead and
then use their movement to back up a bit back into

02:26:41.571 --> 02:26:42.982
the ship.

02:26:48.161 --> 02:26:53.119
This guy's going to duck below over
here. They all duck low and they're all going to

02:26:53.119 --> 02:26:54.765
attempt to hide.

02:26:54.988 --> 02:26:57.182
SAM: Nice. Smart kids.

02:26:58.812 --> 02:27:06.000
MATT: Okay. You watch as they all disappear into
the shadows of the ship's deck. You're uncertain

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.581
where the bowmen are. That brings us to Beau and
Nott.

02:27:12.061 --> 02:27:13.955
MARISHA: Are we going in?

02:27:14.797 --> 02:27:15.971
SAM: I guess?

02:27:15.971 --> 02:27:18.226
LAURA: Just try to get Marius out, right?

02:27:18.226 --> 02:27:22.225
SAM: I'm hiding still, so I'm going to pop up and
shoot the guy next to Marius.

02:27:22.225 --> 02:27:23.733
MATT: Go for it.

02:27:25.579 --> 02:27:31.429
SAM: That is a lot. 20-something. 24 to hit.
Again.

02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:33.663
MATT: 24 to hit? Yeah, that hits.

02:27:33.663 --> 02:27:37.679
LAURA: Is it advantage because he's
incapacitated?

02:27:37.679 --> 02:27:40.528
MATT: Yeah, it's advantage to hit, so you can roll
twice, sorry.

02:27:40.528 --> 02:27:41.752
SAM: Same roll.

02:27:41.752 --> 02:27:43.208
MATT: There you go.

02:27:43.208 --> 02:27:44.813
SAM: Is it sneak attack?

02:27:44.813 --> 02:27:47.049
MATT: Because he's not aware that you were there,
and you were hidden? Yes.

02:27:47.049 --> 02:27:48.261
SAM: Yeah.

02:27:51.697 --> 02:27:53.225
20 points of damage.

02:27:53.470 --> 02:28:01.683
MATT: Nice. He immediately breaks out of the
stupor, glances over and looks at you, and he's

02:28:01.683 --> 02:28:06.882
hurt pretty bad. He's glancing over in your
direction, looking at the rest of everyone there,

02:28:06.882 --> 02:28:11.630
seeing how things are shifting. Looking to his
ship, he looks like he's planning something. What

02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:13.878
else are you going to do?

02:28:13.878 --> 02:28:15.467
SAM: Bonus action. I'll shoot him again.

02:28:15.708 --> 02:28:16.753
MATT: Go for it.

02:28:18.156 --> 02:28:20.262
SAM: Not as good. 17 to hit.

02:28:20.262 --> 02:28:22.663
MATT: 17 to hit? That still hits.

02:28:22.663 --> 02:28:25.972
SAM: Yeah. Eight more points of damage.

02:28:25.972 --> 02:28:27.608
MATT: (death groans)

02:28:27.608 --> 02:28:28.938
(cheering)

02:28:28.938 --> 02:28:31.273
MATT: He tumbles forward over and falls into the
water.

02:28:35.123 --> 02:28:38.719
TRAVIS: Oh man, we might get lucky. Marius!

02:28:39.006 --> 02:28:40.223
MATT: Marius, no!

02:28:40.223 --> 02:28:42.220
SAM: Oh no, I shot the wrong guy!

02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:46.755
MATT: Marius is still just standing there in the
middle of the gangplank, looking upward, going--

02:28:46.755 --> 02:28:48.556
All right.

02:28:48.556 --> 02:28:50.821
MARISHA: How do we get Marius out?

02:28:50.821 --> 02:28:54.123
SAM: I'll run towards Marius, but stop around that
box.

02:28:55.473 --> 02:28:57.538
MARISHA: Do you have a situation?

02:28:58.113 --> 02:29:00.153
LAURA: Well, I was just thinking we could--

02:29:00.153 --> 02:29:01.119
SAM: That's it.

02:29:01.119 --> 02:29:02.208
MATT: Beau?

02:29:02.208 --> 02:29:06.080
LAURA: What's his name? What's the guy-- Orly? Say
Orly sent us and try to get out.

02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:08.117
TRAVIS: If Marius is incapacitated.

02:29:08.117 --> 02:29:09.275
MATT: They don't know that.

02:29:09.275 --> 02:29:10.488
LAURA: Shake him out.

02:29:10.488 --> 02:29:11.351
MATT: They don't know this ability.

02:29:11.351 --> 02:29:12.824
SAM: Beau!

02:29:12.824 --> 02:29:23.231
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to run towards Marius.

02:29:23.231 --> 02:29:26.141
MATT: All right. (counting)

02:29:26.141 --> 02:29:27.939
MARISHA: Got 45 speed.

02:29:27.939 --> 02:29:34.372
MATT You're not quite adjacent-- you're not quite
up to him, but you're ten feet away from him.

02:29:34.372 --> 02:29:37.684
MARISHA: I have an extra five feet of movement. 45
speed.

02:29:37.684 --> 02:29:38.738
MATT: 45 speed?

02:29:38.738 --> 02:29:39.570
MARISHA: Yes.

02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:40.941
MATT: Oh, I thought it was 40.

02:29:40.941 --> 02:29:43.785
MARISHA: I got that in my extra monk level when I
leveled up.

02:29:43.785 --> 02:29:45.491
SAM: (yelling) Oh no, you killed her!

02:29:45.491 --> 02:29:47.254
(laughter)

02:29:47.254 --> 02:29:49.660
TRAVIS: She slips on some slick dock wood and
slides right into him.

02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:52.058
MATT: It's a rough night out here in Nicodranas.

02:29:52.058 --> 02:29:53.316
(laughter)

02:29:53.316 --> 02:29:54.323
MATT: There we go.

02:29:54.323 --> 02:29:56.159
TRAVIS: Fucking power plants are shutting down--

02:29:56.201 --> 02:29:58.701
MATT: There you go. You're up on the gangplank
with him now.

02:29:58.701 --> 02:30:09.974
MARISHA: Can I grab him and tackle him down behind
these barrels? Can I try and drag him back?

02:30:09.974 --> 02:30:12.371
MATT: You can use your action to grapple, if you
want to.

02:30:12.371 --> 02:30:13.520
MARISHA: I do that.

02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:15.285
MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.

02:30:15.285 --> 02:30:21.357
LIAM: Come on, monk. Come on, M! Aw, you didn't
come on.

02:30:21.588 --> 02:30:25.935
MARISHA: But like, why? Why are my rolls so
garbage?

02:30:25.935 --> 02:30:27.470
LAURA: Do you get advantage because he's
incapacitated?

02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:28.968
MARISHA: Do I get advantage because he's
incapacitated?

02:30:28.968 --> 02:30:33.070
MATT: No, it doesn't matter; you have him. I just
wanted to see you roll. He's not fighting at all.

02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:36.426
He's literally just standing there going-- you
grab him.

02:30:36.426 --> 02:30:38.370
TRAVIS: I just wanted to see you roll!

02:30:38.370 --> 02:30:48.190
MARISHA: Fucker. Okay, I grab him. Can I use my
bonus action to try and drag him back?

02:30:48.190 --> 02:30:52.132
MATT: Do you have a ki point?

02:30:52.132 --> 02:30:55.366
MARISHA: I do. Can I do Step of the Wind and then
fucking move him back?

02:30:55.366 --> 02:30:57.815
MATT: You can. You have to pull him back at half
speed, but yeah.

02:30:57.815 --> 02:31:04.477
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to come up behind him and
grapple him and put my staff around his throat,

02:31:04.477 --> 02:31:07.256
making eye contact with everybody else.

02:31:07.256 --> 02:31:09.318
SAM: We're friends! (choking)

02:31:09.318 --> 02:31:11.309
MARISHA: Yeah. I back up.

02:31:11.309 --> 02:31:13.211
MATT: I'll say that knocks him out of his stupor.

02:31:13.211 --> 02:31:16.761
MARISHA: Well. You know, okay.

02:31:16.761 --> 02:31:19.172
MATT: When you're choking him and forcing to pull
him backwards--

02:31:19.172 --> 02:31:21.301
MARISHA: Well, you said grapple.

02:31:21.301 --> 02:31:25.751
MATT: Yeah. But grapple by putting your staff into
his throat and pulling him backwards--

02:31:25.751 --> 02:31:27.175
LAURA: It's different.

02:31:27.175 --> 02:31:28.683
SAM: It's a pretty harsh grapple.

02:31:28.683 --> 02:31:30.312
LIAM: Pretty harsh woman.

02:31:30.312 --> 02:31:31.683
LAURA: She's a harsh girl.

02:31:31.683 --> 02:31:34.431
MATT: You've pulled Marius back.

02:31:34.431 --> 02:31:36.512
MARISHA: Not a subtle person.

02:31:36.512 --> 02:31:38.713
LIAM: Whatever Mama wants, Mama gets.

02:31:38.713 --> 02:31:42.404
MARISHA: That's my turn. I've got Marius!
I've got Marius!

02:31:42.404 --> 02:31:45.450
MATT: All right, that finishes Beau's turn. That
finishes Nott's turn, now it's the Enforcers'

02:31:45.501 --> 02:31:52.189
turn. One Enforcer fell over, keeled over, dead.
The other one is going to step back out from the

02:31:52.189 --> 02:32:01.155
inside for a second. He's carrying a heavy
crossbow that he has winched back. Pulls it up

02:32:01.288 --> 02:32:07.391
and is going to spin and-- the first person he
sees coming out of there is probably going to be

02:32:07.391 --> 02:32:12.256
you, Beau, because you are the one who's grabbing
him and pulling him off the gangplank as he steps

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:14.119
out and looks and sees you.

02:32:14.119 --> 02:32:19.393
MARISHA: Do I have three-quarters cover? Because
I'm using him as a human shield?

02:32:19.393 --> 02:32:24.003
MATT: I'd say you have half cover because of the
boxes that you've pulled up behind. Unless you

02:32:24.003 --> 02:32:27.787
want to use him as a human shield? That's up to
you.

02:32:27.787 --> 02:32:33.387
SAM: We're here to save you! Oh god! Block his
arrow for me!

02:32:33.387 --> 02:32:35.948
TALIESIN: Everyone has to pull their weight, man.

02:32:35.948 --> 02:32:44.920
MATT: He gets two shots. Natural 20 and a 17,
which I don't think hits, right?

02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:46.005
MARISHA: Misses.

02:32:46.005 --> 02:32:55.553
MATT: Yep. That is 20 points of piercing damage.

02:32:55.858 --> 02:32:57.317
MARISHA: Do I get deflect missiles?

02:32:57.317 --> 02:32:58.552
MATT: You have a reaction still, right?

02:32:58.552 --> 02:33:01.355
MARISHA: Yes I do. Okay, 15.

02:33:01.355 --> 02:33:04.298
MATT: You take nine points-- 15?

02:33:04.298 --> 02:33:08.418
MARISHA: Yeah. Five plus my monk level plus
dex, right?

02:33:08.418 --> 02:33:11.174
MATT: Is that how much it reduces it by, total?

02:33:11.174 --> 02:33:16.245
LIAM: Just look through our 2000 rules here, wait
a second.

02:33:16.245 --> 02:33:17.919
MATT: I know, that's fine.

02:33:17.919 --> 02:33:20.168
MARISHA: Oh, and it's also a 1d10; I just rolled a
1d8.

02:33:20.168 --> 02:33:24.689
MATT: Okay, reroll. 1d10 plus your monk level plus
your dexterity?

02:33:24.689 --> 02:33:30.241
MARISHA: Right. See, this is old, but it's-- or is
it my proficiency bonus?

02:33:30.241 --> 02:33:32.811
MATT: No, it's monk level and dexterity, you're
right. You totally got it, go for it.

02:33:32.811 --> 02:33:38.635
MARISHA: Okay, I'm not a crazy person. It's not as
good, but 13.

02:33:38.635 --> 02:33:50.030
MATT: All right, you take seven points of piercing
damage. That ends that. That brings us to Caleb.

02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:52.620
No sorry, Jester, you're up first, then Caleb.

02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:54.392
MARISHA: Jester, help.

02:33:54.392 --> 02:33:57.656
LAURA: Okay, you're right. Are you hurting?

02:33:57.656 --> 02:34:05.603
MARISHA: No, I'm just-- I mean, I'm not-- I'm
okay.

02:34:05.603 --> 02:34:13.926
LAURA: I guess-- this is really hard.

02:34:13.926 --> 02:34:19.156
MARISHA: Any assistance getting Marius out?

02:34:19.156 --> 02:34:23.732
LAURA: I don't have anything that's going to help
get him out that I can think of.

02:34:23.732 --> 02:34:30.175
MARISHA: Yeah, if you keep them away, Yasha and I
can make it work.

02:34:30.175 --> 02:34:42.325
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast-- fuck. I'll move
forward-- well, yeah, to be closer to Beau, and

02:34:42.588 --> 02:34:45.727
I'm going to cast-- fuck it-- Sanctuary.

02:34:45.727 --> 02:34:47.287
MATT: On Beau?

02:34:47.287 --> 02:34:49.594
LAURA: Yeah.

02:34:49.594 --> 02:34:52.082
MATT: All righty.

02:34:52.082 --> 02:34:54.060
SAM: (like Laura) Yeah.

02:34:54.060 --> 02:34:58.319
LIAM: Do you resurrect him? 
(Eeyore voice) I guess.

02:34:58.319 --> 02:35:06.621
LAURA: Yeah, Sanctuary on Beau, so anybody that
makes an attack against her has to either--

02:35:06.621 --> 02:35:12.612
whatever, you know the spell. Then I'm going to--
sorry, that's a bonus action.

02:35:12.612 --> 02:35:14.029
SAM: Eeyore casts it.

02:35:14.029 --> 02:35:15.876
MATT: I know, seriously.

02:35:15.876 --> 02:35:18.777
SAM: (as Eeyore) You know, anyone who tries to
kill her can.

02:35:18.777 --> 02:35:21.775
LAURA: I'm freaking out! I don't know what to do!

02:35:21.775 --> 02:35:24.213
LIAM: (as Eeyore) It doesn't matter anyway.

02:35:24.213 --> 02:35:27.835
SAM: (as Eeyore) We're all going to die in the
end.

02:35:27.835 --> 02:35:33.808
LAURA: Then I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at--
can I see anybody on the boat?

02:35:33.808 --> 02:35:37.613
MATT: Right now, you can see one guy on the boat.

02:35:37.613 --> 02:35:39.511
LAURA: I guess I'm going to try to hit him.

02:35:39.511 --> 02:35:41.526
MATT: What's the range on Sacred Flame?

02:35:41.526 --> 02:35:43.242
LAURA: 60 feet.

02:35:43.242 --> 02:35:46.161
MATT: He gets a what save? Is it constitution or
is it wisdom?

02:35:46.161 --> 02:35:47.425
LAURA: A dex.

02:35:47.425 --> 02:35:51.035
MATT: Oh, a dex. That would be 13; that's a
failure.

02:35:51.035 --> 02:35:53.158
TRAVIS: Sacred Flame making it through!

02:35:53.158 --> 02:35:59.150
LAURA: Woo! Six points of damage. Yeah, Hold
Person, that was a good one.

02:35:59.150 --> 02:36:01.591
LIAM: Yes, it was. That was a good move.

02:36:01.591 --> 02:36:02.962
MATT: It's all good. It was a good move.

02:36:02.962 --> 02:36:07.596
LAURA: Then I'm going to use the rest of my
movement to go back to where I was.

02:36:07.705 --> 02:36:10.396
MATT: That's as far as you go. You used the rest
of your movement to get up to that point.

02:36:10.396 --> 02:36:11.493
LAURA: Cool.

02:36:11.493 --> 02:36:13.515
MATT: That ends your go. Caleb, you're up.

02:36:13.515 --> 02:36:19.005
LIAM: Okay, so factoring in a couple of things.
One is that I see my friend Beauregard getting

02:36:19.005 --> 02:36:24.240
hammered on by them, which I do not like. Also, I
heard some voice from the boat yell out, "Burn

02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:35.733
"it," so out comes the bat guano and sulfur, and
slap, and a beam rockets out, 150-foot range, to

02:36:35.733 --> 02:36:39.467
about here, and erupts.

02:36:39.467 --> 02:36:42.927
TRAVIS: Please be shipping black powder.

02:36:42.927 --> 02:36:48.281
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (explosions)

02:36:48.281 --> 02:36:52.450
SAM: We're killing everyone on the boat. We don't
even know who they are!

02:36:52.450 --> 02:36:55.190
TRAVIS: Who gives a shit? They deserve to die!

02:36:55.190 --> 02:37:01.825
MATT: This is not a moral group by any stretch of
the imagination. They're getting better than they

02:37:01.825 --> 02:37:03.997
used to be, but man.

02:37:03.997 --> 02:37:11.422
LIAM: Yeah, Vox Machina is gone. The point is to
get it to a range where I know that it's not going

02:37:11.422 --> 02:37:13.827
to affect them on the dock. It's going to hit the
boat.

02:37:13.827 --> 02:37:18.358
MATT: You're getting the boat in this, too? All
right. Let's do it.

02:37:18.358 --> 02:37:20.946
SAM: To get the people, yeah, you've got to get
the boat.

02:37:21.352 --> 02:37:27.880
LIAM: Yeah, absolutely. What am I, a surgeon? I
have a 3rd-level spell because I used arcane

02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:30.034
recovery back at the chateau.

02:37:30.034 --> 02:37:33.664
MATT: Okay. Specify that next time, but sure, go
for it. I know you would.

02:37:33.664 --> 02:37:35.412
LIAM: I also took a poop while at the chateau, but
I thought I didn't--

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:37.347
MATT: I know, that's fine.

02:37:37.347 --> 02:37:40.945
TRAVIS: I hope there's nobody important in the bow
of the ship.

02:37:40.945 --> 02:37:44.090
TALIESIN: There's so many things that could be
going horribly wrong right now.

02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:48.230
MARISHA: Yeah. A bunch of refugees wanting safe
passage.

02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:51.217
SAM: Don't worry, Sabian is hanging out below
decks.

02:37:51.217 --> 02:37:57.236
LAURA: Is there any way to see what the name of
that ship is? Is it on the side of the ship at all?

02:37:58.028 --> 02:38:01.140
MATT: You'd have to spend an action to look for
it. The name would be towards the back, and it's

02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:03.436
facing away from you.

02:38:03.436 --> 02:38:06.110
TRAVIS: He would've painted that shit on there. I
don't see it in there.

02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:09.203
MARISHA: Everywhere, on every panel.

02:38:09.203 --> 02:38:10.657
LIAM: 27.

02:38:10.657 --> 02:38:23.074
MATT: The Enforcer fails, so he takes the full 27.
Success, success, and failure.

02:38:23.074 --> 02:38:28.613
LIAM: I will use my movement to step around the
corner of the house and I will begin to count to

02:38:28.613 --> 02:38:31.373
20 slowly in Zemnian to calm my nerves.

02:38:31.373 --> 02:38:39.654
MATT: You move behind here. I'm going to roll a
saving throw for the ship's sails. Not bad. The

02:38:39.654 --> 02:38:45.601
sails do not catch fire. They're charred a little
bit from underneath, but the ship isn't now

02:38:45.601 --> 02:38:52.426
suddenly a giant burning torchlight beacon in the
middle of the fucking harbor.

02:38:52.426 --> 02:38:55.496
LIAM: I don't know if Caleb is a firebug, or if I
am.

02:38:55.496 --> 02:38:57.323
MATT: I know. I respect that.

02:38:57.323 --> 02:38:59.955
MARISHA: I think it's you?

02:38:59.955 --> 02:39:02.039
TRAVIS: Hey man, if you've got Fireball.

02:39:02.039 --> 02:39:04.917
MATT: That ends Caleb's go. Captain's dead.
Caduceus, you're up.

02:39:04.917 --> 02:39:07.065
SAM: All the human cargo is dead.

02:39:07.065 --> 02:39:08.920
LIAM: They're still standing.

02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:12.104
SAM: No, the slaves that were below deck.

02:39:12.104 --> 02:39:14.222
LIAM: The guy came out and said, "Burn all the
slaves"?

02:39:14.222 --> 02:39:15.957
LAURA: No, they said, "Burn it all."

02:39:15.957 --> 02:39:24.114
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to throw a Healing Word
at Beau, and I'm going to start getting out of

02:39:24.114 --> 02:39:30.551
here. I want to cast Healing Word. It's not a lot.
No, it's 60 feet.

02:39:30.551 --> 02:39:32.615
MATT: Yeah, you're within range.

02:39:32.615 --> 02:39:35.590
TALIESIN: That's nice; it's eight points.

02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:38.393
MATT: There you go, eight points to Beau.

02:39:38.393 --> 02:39:45.994
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to start booking out of
here.

02:39:45.994 --> 02:39:47.615
MATT: Where're you going?

02:39:47.615 --> 02:39:53.802
TALIESIN: I'm heading back around the way I assume
everyone else is going. Yeah, that way.

02:39:53.802 --> 02:39:57.738
MATT: Okay. There's Caduceus. Finishing your go.
Yasha's up.

02:39:57.738 --> 02:40:03.634
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to rush up and aid Beau in
trying to pull Marius towards the docks.

02:40:03.634 --> 02:40:09.631
MATT: Okay. If she wants to, she can attempt to
grapple and then pull him out of Beau's grip, or

02:40:09.631 --> 02:40:14.827
we can say she holds her action and then-- it gets
a little weird, because it's-- movement is what

02:40:14.827 --> 02:40:16.107
you pull him out of the way.

02:40:16.107 --> 02:40:19.338
TRAVIS: Would it help make full speed when it
comes back to Beau's turn if she's assisting? Can

02:40:19.338 --> 02:40:20.085
they double pull?

02:40:20.085 --> 02:40:23.862
MARISHA: Can she go, and then I assist on my
turn?

02:40:23.862 --> 02:40:25.399
MATT: I'll allow it.

02:40:25.399 --> 02:40:29.466
TRAVIS: Yeah. I guess do you want me to roll to
grapple?

02:40:29.466 --> 02:40:34.173
MATT: Yes, because he is resisting amongst her
grapple as well, and it's harder to do that.

02:40:34.173 --> 02:40:35.659
TRAVIS: 15 plus her natural strength.

02:40:35.659 --> 02:40:42.748
MATT: Yeah. All right, now it's Marius's turn.
He's going to attempt to break free, now that he's

02:40:42.748 --> 02:40:48.698
full of mind and he's freaking out. "What's he--
what's going--?" Make an acrobatics check against

02:40:48.698 --> 02:40:56.343
your athletics. Technically, since you're both
grappling, either you or Yasha can make the check,

02:40:56.343 --> 02:40:59.502
and it's with advantage, I'll say, because you're
both holding.

02:40:59.502 --> 02:41:03.125
TRAVIS: God, it's an athletics check? What's her
athletics?

02:41:03.125 --> 02:41:07.481
MATT: Strength is plus three and it would be at
plus six, probably.

02:41:07.481 --> 02:41:09.733
MARISHA: I'll do mine, since mine's also a plus
six.

02:41:09.733 --> 02:41:10.860
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:13.528
TRAVIS and LIAM: Get it, girl.

02:41:13.528 --> 02:41:15.362
MATT: Oh, he almost rolled really high.

02:41:15.362 --> 02:41:17.789
LIAM: Oh! Those are two bad dice rolls.

02:41:17.789 --> 02:41:18.935
MARISHA: 11 total.

02:41:18.935 --> 02:41:22.354
MATT: He does still manage to break free! Yay!

02:41:22.354 --> 02:41:24.296
SAM: Something's going well for Matt.

02:41:24.296 --> 02:41:27.715
MATT: He's going to run.

02:41:27.715 --> 02:41:32.424
MARISHA: Motherfucking piece of shit. Why would
you do that?

02:41:32.424 --> 02:41:35.170
LAURA: Seriously? They had a dagger to your
throat, you dick.

02:41:35.170 --> 02:41:36.563
SAM: The ship's on fire.

02:41:36.563 --> 02:41:41.636
MATT: The ship's not on fire, but he has no reason
to trust any of you and was meeting with these

02:41:41.636 --> 02:41:47.879
people. If he's going to choose between the two,
he's going to step into the ship there. He's like,

02:41:47.879 --> 02:41:54.875
(panting), gets down low, and is hiding. But you
know right where he is. That brings us to the top

02:41:54.875 --> 02:41:56.869
of the round. Fjord, your turn.

02:41:56.869 --> 02:41:58.946
SAM: No problem, we got this.

02:41:58.946 --> 02:42:02.414
LIAM: Fjord pulls out the big guns. Master plan,
here it is.

02:42:02.414 --> 02:42:04.487
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm going to run over here.

02:42:04.487 --> 02:42:07.675
MARISHA: We worked so hard to get him that far.

02:42:07.675 --> 02:42:15.541
TRAVIS: (counting) I'm going to stand out here and
I'll unleash two Eldritch Blasts at this Enforcer.

02:42:15.544 --> 02:42:20.430
MATT: At that guy? You can look and see now: he is
not the Enforcer that went below deck previously.

02:42:20.430 --> 02:42:24.802
He's dressed similarly, but now that you get a
better look at this view in the light, he's

02:42:24.802 --> 02:42:27.048
somebody else. There is still one person down in
the ship.

02:42:27.048 --> 02:42:31.023
TRAVIS: (quietly) Awesome, great, good stuff.
(louder) That's a 20.

02:42:31.023 --> 02:42:32.864
MATT: That hits.

02:42:32.864 --> 02:42:34.167
TRAVIS: 11.

02:42:34.167 --> 02:42:35.617
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:42:35.617 --> 02:42:36.666
TRAVIS: Oh, nice, okay.

02:42:36.666 --> 02:42:39.650
MATT: Yeah, he has leather armor. His AC is 11;
he's pretty easy to hit.

02:42:39.650 --> 02:42:45.895
TRAVIS: 11 points of damage on the first one and
ten points of damage on the second, so 22 total.

02:42:45.895 --> 02:42:53.474
MATT: Ooh, that'll do it. Both blasts take him
down. The attrition is not working well in his favor.

02:42:53.485 --> 02:42:57.645
LAURA: (inaudible)

02:42:57.645 --> 02:42:59.314
SAM: Why don't we say that?

02:42:59.314 --> 02:43:01.964
LAURA: (whispering) Because I'm not up there, and
no one else is remembering.

02:43:01.964 --> 02:43:04.165
TRAVIS: What, that "we come bearing gifts"?

02:43:04.165 --> 02:43:06.625
LAURA: "The Captain" is what we're supposed to
say.

02:43:06.625 --> 02:43:09.303
MARISHA: It feels like we're really in battle
now.

02:43:09.303 --> 02:43:14.899
MATT: Caduceus, you do hear-- a ways away, not
here yet, but you do hear some voices and

02:43:14.899 --> 02:43:20.835
footfalls, armored footfalls. You get the sense
that zolezzo are on their way.

02:43:20.835 --> 02:43:26.482
TALIESIN: Guys, we're going to have problems soon.
We should probably get out of here.

02:43:26.482 --> 02:43:28.783
MATT: He will say on his turn when he gets there.

02:43:28.783 --> 02:43:30.537
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's right, I'm not there yet.

02:43:30.537 --> 02:43:35.678
MATT: The bowmen now, who've been hidden below the
deck and have endured the Fireball, two of them

02:43:35.678 --> 02:43:43.350
are going to, from their positions, stand up, and
they're going to take shots at you. (arrows

02:43:43.350 --> 02:43:51.012
firing) They have advantage on both because they
were hidden from you. That is a 19 to hit?

02:43:51.012 --> 02:43:52.144
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:43:52.144 --> 02:43:56.031
MATT: Second one, that's cocked. Advantage. That
is a 20 to hit.

02:43:56.031 --> 02:43:59.279
TRAVIS: It hits. Punish me for this horrible
fucking crap.

02:43:59.279 --> 02:44:15.590
MATT: They have sneak attack because they were
hidden from you. 29 points of piercing damage,

02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:19.694
from those two hits.

02:44:19.694 --> 02:44:20.733
LAURA: Are you still up?

02:44:20.733 --> 02:44:21.639
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

02:44:21.639 --> 02:44:33.443
MATT: The third goes and unfurls the sail and
pulls the rope, and it begins to unroll. A little

02:44:33.791 --> 02:44:36.279
bit of wind is blowing. It opens up a bit.

02:44:36.279 --> 02:44:39.488
LAURA: Do we see the sail? Does it have any
markings on it?

02:44:39.488 --> 02:44:47.528
MATT: No, it is fairly plain. You get the sense
that they're now looking for a way to get out of

02:44:47.528 --> 02:44:53.345
here. Ships aren't the fastest when it comes to
exits, but they're trying. That brings us to Beau

02:44:53.345 --> 02:44:55.289
and Nott.

02:44:55.289 --> 02:44:59.905
TRAVIS: Let them go. What the fuck are we going to
do? Run and jump on the goddamn boat?

02:44:59.905 --> 02:45:02.350
MARISHA: I was about to do that, yeah.

02:45:02.350 --> 02:45:10.769
MATT: At the end of their turn, these guys are
going to move back as well, and attempt to hide again.

02:45:10.918 --> 02:45:12.147
LIAM: Fuck yeah.

02:45:12.147 --> 02:45:13.732
TRAVIS: All right, sure, go for it.

02:45:13.732 --> 02:45:17.126
LAURA: What? You don't know how many people are on
that boat! Oh my god.

02:45:17.126 --> 02:45:20.766
MATT: They're not very good at hiding, though.
(laughs) They rolled really bad. All three of

02:45:20.766 --> 02:45:23.536
them. At once. A one, a three, and a four.

02:45:23.536 --> 02:45:25.544
TALIESIN: It's a shame they never roll that way
when they're attacking.

02:45:25.544 --> 02:45:30.079
MATT: That's funny. You see them duck down but
they're all pulling out their arrow and nocking it

02:45:30.079 --> 02:45:35.226
into the bow, and you can see exactly where
they're hidden. What's the plan, Beau and Nott?

02:45:35.226 --> 02:45:36.505
LIAM: Bone it.

02:45:36.505 --> 02:45:37.929
TRAVIS: Do what you were going to do. Do it!

02:45:37.929 --> 02:45:39.225
MARISHA: You go first.

02:45:39.225 --> 02:45:39.981
TRAVIS: Do it!

02:45:39.981 --> 02:45:43.736
MARISHA: Are you going to go for the sail? You
could go for the sail, potentially.

02:45:43.736 --> 02:45:45.663
SAM: Thought about that.

02:45:45.663 --> 02:45:53.574
MARISHA: If you could start it, I could maybe rip
it. I don't know, I'm spitballing here. I don't

02:45:53.574 --> 02:45:54.812
know what to do.

02:45:54.812 --> 02:45:56.514
MATT: Make your choices, guys.

02:45:56.514 --> 02:45:59.686
SAM: We've got two bowmen. Who's the guy in black
over there? The Enforcer who came up?

02:45:59.686 --> 02:46:05.769
MATT: No, the Enforcer's dead. Fjord just blew him
up on the side. There's now only three bowmen on

02:46:05.769 --> 02:46:10.940
the deck, and they're all hurt really badly from
the fireball explosion, and they all think they're

02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:12.917
hidden but they're not.

02:46:12.917 --> 02:46:14.892
TRAVIS: Go ahead and fuck them up, man. Go for
it.

02:46:14.892 --> 02:46:23.592
SAM: I'll-- shit, I want to use my sneak attack. I
will bonus action hide and then, from my hidden

02:46:23.592 --> 02:46:25.226
position, I will shoot.

02:46:25.226 --> 02:46:27.735
MATT: Move around the side? All right. Against
which one?

02:46:27.735 --> 02:46:29.460
SAM: The guy in black over there.

02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:33.477
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack, with advantage
because he does not see you.

02:46:33.477 --> 02:46:36.719
SAM: Oh, nice. That's a 23.

02:46:36.719 --> 02:46:40.365
MATT: Yeah, that hits, so go ahead and roll
damage. With sneak attack.

02:46:40.365 --> 02:46:46.219
SAM: That was a good roll.

02:46:46.219 --> 02:46:48.101
TALIESIN: Oh, that's mean.

02:46:48.101 --> 02:46:50.374
SAM: 23 points of damage.

02:46:50.374 --> 02:46:54.160
MATT: The impact hits him and he falls back and
hits the edge of the ship, and then tumbles over

02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:57.819
and splooshes into the water behind. You hear no
noise.

02:46:57.819 --> 02:47:03.867
SAM: I will use any movement to emerge from my
hidden position and move up a bit, to behind those

02:47:04.041 --> 02:47:06.337
barrels, maybe, so I have a little cover.

02:47:06.337 --> 02:47:07.928
MATT: Okay.

02:47:07.928 --> 02:47:16.905
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to run up and go after
these two bowmen, I guess. Fuck me, what am I doing?

02:47:16.905 --> 02:47:19.049
TRAVIS: We're all going to die.

02:47:19.049 --> 02:47:24.052
MATT: You rush, running across the gangplank. As
soon as you come to the edge you look down, and

02:47:24.052 --> 02:47:27.735
there's one of the guys who's about to turn with
his bow and goes (gasp) and sees you--

02:47:27.735 --> 02:47:29.458
MARISHA: I just roundhouse him to the face.

02:47:29.458 --> 02:47:31.126
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

02:47:31.126 --> 02:47:33.259
MARISHA: Motherfucker! Ten.

02:47:33.259 --> 02:47:40.906
MATT: Ten misses. You go and kick, and the water
on the slick deck makes you slip. You catch

02:47:40.974 --> 02:47:42.896
yourself and don't tumble off the side--

02:47:42.896 --> 02:47:45.133
SAM: You got to wear boat shoes!

02:47:45.133 --> 02:47:49.470
MARISHA: I haven't rolled above a five all night.
Okay!

02:47:50.493 --> 02:47:51.493
LIAM: She's back.

02:47:51.493 --> 02:47:53.271
24. No, 23.

02:47:53.439 --> 02:47:57.282
MATT: That hits. You go for one roundhouse and
slip, using the momentum you spin with a lower

02:47:57.282 --> 02:48:01.901
circle kick, like a sweep kick, which is about
head level with him.

02:48:01.901 --> 02:48:03.455
MARISHA: Eight damage.

02:48:03.455 --> 02:48:09.474
MATT: Eight points of damage? That'll do it. The
bowmen don't have a lot of hit points.

02:48:09.474 --> 02:48:11.658
SAM: They've been burned badly.

02:48:11.658 --> 02:48:16.452
MATT: He (groan) and then falls unconscious onto
the deck of the ship.

02:48:16.452 --> 02:48:18.856
MARISHA: Do I have enough-- can I get the other
guy?

02:48:18.856 --> 02:48:22.896
MATT: You do have enough movement, you have 15
feet more, so you leap down onto his crumpled

02:48:22.896 --> 02:48:27.834
unconscious body, and his other friend is going to
pull back to try and take a shot while he's

02:48:27.834 --> 02:48:30.510
backing up towards the back portion of the ship.

02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:35.832
MARISHA: I go: Melee range, you can't do it! And
then a 19?

02:48:35.832 --> 02:48:37.833
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:48:37.930 --> 02:48:41.727
MARISHA: Big money. Okay! Nine. Die! Die!

02:48:43.697 --> 02:48:44.697
MATT: And so he--

02:48:44.697 --> 02:48:48.154
You (impact sound), and he falls unconscious
onto the ground.

02:48:50.136 --> 02:48:56.013
MARISHA: I turn to Marius and I say "The Gentleman
sent us? Gentleman? You a Gentleman?"

02:48:57.176 --> 02:49:00.337
MATT: He's like (startled gasping). Make a
persuasion check.

02:49:00.337 --> 02:49:01.181
MARISHA: Really?

02:49:01.181 --> 02:49:02.371
MATT: Yeah!

02:49:02.371 --> 02:49:03.876
TRAVIS: We need to get onto the boat and get out
of here.

02:49:03.876 --> 02:49:07.612
MATT: You just killed or beat unconscious the guys
he was coming to meet.

02:49:07.612 --> 02:49:10.302
LIAM: We just flip this. We're going to jack this
fucking boat and get out of here.

02:49:10.302 --> 02:49:11.405
MARISHA: Seven.

02:49:11.405 --> 02:49:15.828
MATT: Seven? He right now is looking panicked, and
the words aren't coming through. He thinks maybe

02:49:15.828 --> 02:49:21.629
you're calling him a gentleman. He's like
(panicked noises), and he's backing away from you.

02:49:22.094 --> 02:49:24.771
LIAM: Ladies and gentlemen.

02:49:24.771 --> 02:49:26.786
(laughter)

02:49:27.571 --> 02:49:29.439
MATT: All right, that ends Beau and Nott's turn.

02:49:29.439 --> 02:49:32.410
LIAM: Life is disappointing, eh?

02:49:32.410 --> 02:49:38.540
MATT: You do hear what sounds like some movement.
The door is partially open to the cabin below and

02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:43.411
there is light coming from the inside, some sort
of lantern light. You hear things being moved around.

02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:46.952
MARISHA: Can I stand on top of the door? Do I have
enough movement to do that?

02:49:46.952 --> 02:49:50.684
MATT: You have five more feet to get to the door
and look beneath but you don't see anything yet.

02:49:50.684 --> 02:49:53.599
MARISHA: I want to tamp it down, stand my full
weight on top of it.

02:49:53.599 --> 02:49:57.504
MATT: Well, the door is on the side, so you'd have
to put your weight against it, yeah.

02:49:57.504 --> 02:49:59.096
MARISHA: Okay.

02:49:59.096 --> 02:50:04.241
MATT: You're up against the door. That brings us
to Jester.

02:50:04.241 --> 02:50:05.636
LAURA: Are we trying to get back on the boat now?

02:50:05.636 --> 02:50:06.600
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:07.565
SAM: Maybe?

02:50:07.565 --> 02:50:08.535
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:50:08.535 --> 02:50:13.359
LAURA: Okay, I guess I'm going to-- fucking, like
an asshole, run towards the boat. God, this is so

02:50:13.359 --> 02:50:19.520
dumb. I run towards the boat, but I'm going to--
as far as I can.

02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:21.154
SAM: Where are you?

02:50:21.154 --> 02:50:22.459
LIAM: Way far away.

02:50:22.459 --> 02:50:23.950
SAM: We're going to have to fucking wait ten
minutes--

02:50:23.950 --> 02:50:25.351
LIAM: No you won't. No you won't.

02:50:25.351 --> 02:50:27.966
MATT: You can make an action to dash if you want
to get there and do nothing else.

02:50:28.116 --> 02:50:29.472
LAURA: How hurt are you?

02:50:29.472 --> 02:50:30.730
TRAVIS: I'm fine.

02:50:30.730 --> 02:50:34.840
TALIESIN: You've got me too. I'm still spelled up
to all hell.

02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:37.737
LAURA: Okay, I'll double dash to get to the
fucking boat.

02:50:39.587 --> 02:50:41.480
MARISHA: Jump, Jester, jump!

02:50:42.219 --> 02:50:46.311
MATT: You're making your way across the gangplank
like, "oh god!" You're just about to make it to

02:50:46.311 --> 02:50:50.524
the ship, and that's the end of your bonus dash.
Caduceus, you're up. No, sorry, Caleb!

02:50:50.524 --> 02:50:59.716
LIAM: Okay, I see which way the wind is blowing. I
mutter a few arcane words and I cast the spell

02:50:59.716 --> 02:51:05.342
Expeditious Retreat, which is a transmutation
spell so I will also send a little bit of arcane

02:51:05.342 --> 02:51:09.005
energy to the Transmutation stone to give myself
extra speed as well.

02:51:09.005 --> 02:51:10.377
MATT: You can do that!

02:51:10.377 --> 02:51:16.333
LIAM: I can use my action, my movement, and my
bonus action to move full movement at 40.

02:51:16.485 --> 02:51:18.011
So, Vax is back.

02:51:18.011 --> 02:51:19.935
MATT: Vax is back, baby.

02:51:19.935 --> 02:51:21.910
LIAM: I am now on the boat.

02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:25.111
LAURA: Oh my lord. He can do it again.

02:51:25.154 --> 02:51:29.625
LIAM: Transmutation spell gets my movement up to
40. Right.

02:51:29.803 --> 02:51:30.922
(laughs roguishly)

02:51:30.922 --> 02:51:37.989
Action, movement, plus now Expeditious Retreat
is a bonus action.

02:51:38.191 --> 02:51:40.503
MATT: Correct. You can move 80 feet.

02:51:40.503 --> 02:51:42.568
LIAM: 40 plus 40 plus 40?

02:51:42.568 --> 02:51:47.568
MATT: It's a bonus action to cast the spell. Oh,
and when you cast the spell, and then as a bonus

02:51:47.568 --> 02:51:53.787
action-- oh, wow, so it's a dash action as the
spell when it's cast as well, so yeah. That's 120 feet.

02:51:53.927 --> 02:51:55.057
TALIESIN: Whoa.

02:51:55.057 --> 02:52:00.385
LIAM: A red blur goes (zooming sound) and I am
standing next to Beauregard on the boat.

02:52:00.385 --> 02:52:03.023
SAM: Flash! Aah!

02:52:03.023 --> 02:52:05.384
TALIESIN: He'll save every one of us!

02:52:05.384 --> 02:52:08.085
LAURA: He went so fast he knocked me into the
boat.

02:52:08.085 --> 02:52:12.904
MATT: You do, actually, Jester tumbles forward
into the boat from the sheer force of Caleb

02:52:12.904 --> 02:52:15.744
(zooming sound) flashing into the space.

02:52:15.917 --> 02:52:17.112
LIAM: Are we stealing the boat?

02:52:17.112 --> 02:52:18.610
MARISHA: Oh, we're all here.

02:52:18.610 --> 02:52:23.205
LAURA: Does anyone know how to fucking drive a
boat?

02:52:23.205 --> 02:52:24.947
SAM: No one on the boat does.

02:52:24.947 --> 02:52:26.938
MATT: All right, that finishes Caleb's turn.

02:52:26.938 --> 02:52:29.060
MARISHA: The guy who's definitely not here.

02:52:30.250 --> 02:52:32.360
LAURA: Oh my god, the zolezzo are going to come.

02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:34.129
MATT: From around this corner--

02:52:34.241 --> 02:52:36.268
MARISHA: Oh no! We swear we're not pirates!

02:52:36.268 --> 02:52:37.965
LIAM: Way to build that tension.

02:52:37.965 --> 02:52:45.065
MATT: --begin to appear, and now the zolezzo that
are coming around the corner are coming forward

02:52:45.065 --> 02:52:54.048
with torches. There are more a little further down
the way, and they're shouting out, "What's going

02:52:54.048 --> 02:52:59.542
on? What is--" Looking around, they can see you,
Fjord, they can see Yasha up on the side, and they

02:52:59.542 --> 02:53:01.990
can see people on the ship across the way.

02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.891
SAM: Oh, no.

02:53:03.035 --> 02:53:05.384
MATT: But that's their turn. They've acknowledged
you and they're telling you to halt and they're

02:53:05.384 --> 02:53:12.061
asking for your attention. Now it's going to turn
to Caduceus' turn. They do not see you. The sound

02:53:12.061 --> 02:53:14.531
you heard, you couldn't quite make out the
direction it's coming from, but you can now hear

02:53:14.531 --> 02:53:16.834
it coming from around the edge of the street.

02:53:16.834 --> 02:53:26.012
TALIESIN: I'm going to ponder. I'm going to make
the sound of a bunch of people panicking and

02:53:26.012 --> 02:53:28.503
saying, "Hide everything, hide everything."

02:53:28.666 --> 02:53:29.790
MATT: With?

02:53:29.790 --> 02:53:31.675
TALIESIN: With Thaumaturgy.

02:53:32.575 --> 02:53:34.350
MATT: You're stretching the cantrip a bit.

02:53:34.505 --> 02:53:37.327
TALIESIN: No, I thought, "you can create an
instantaneous sound that originates from a point

02:53:37.327 --> 02:53:39.746
of your choice within range."

02:53:39.746 --> 02:53:43.930
MATT: It's a sound, like a bird caw. You can't
create the sound of a whole crowd screaming.

02:53:43.930 --> 02:53:45.507
TALIESIN: That's fair, that's fair.

02:53:45.507 --> 02:53:50.474
LAURA: You can do ominous whispers. It's listed.

02:53:50.474 --> 02:53:58.326
TALIESIN: It is listed. I'm going to make one of
the doors on that boat over there slam shut really loudly.

02:53:58.924 --> 02:54:01.416
MATT: (door slamming sound). It does so.

02:54:01.416 --> 02:54:07.577
TALIESIN: I'm going to run and hide behind the
map. I'm going off the map around there. Yep.

02:54:07.577 --> 02:54:10.797
MARISHA: You're going the other way? Away from
everybody else?

02:54:10.797 --> 02:54:11.524
SAM: Oh no!

02:54:11.524 --> 02:54:13.552
TALIESIN: I'm going to just be going--

02:54:13.552 --> 02:54:15.413
MARISHA: We'll catch you upstream.

02:54:15.554 --> 02:54:17.829
TRAVIS: He's going to go hang with the Ruby.

02:54:17.829 --> 02:54:21.402
LAURA: We can't get the boat out of here fast
enough before they can catch the boat.

02:54:21.402 --> 02:54:24.550
MATT: All right, go ahead and-- actually, no, this
would be on their end.

02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:28.444
TALIESIN: That'll just be 30 feet, and I'm not
running, I'm walking.

02:54:28.444 --> 02:54:32.774
MATT: It does catch their attention, and they look
over, and the few that hadn't seen Fjord now look

02:54:32.774 --> 02:54:40.280
over and see Fjord on the dock as well. There you
go. They are aware of those that are currently

02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:44.112
visible on the deck of the ship, and Fjord, and
Yasha over there.

02:54:44.112 --> 02:54:45.517
MARISHA: Great.

02:54:45.517 --> 02:54:47.718
MATT: That ends it-- Yasha's turn? What's Yasha
going to do?

02:54:47.718 --> 02:54:51.576
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to run her ass onto the
boat. Double dash, if she needs to.

02:54:51.576 --> 02:54:54.357
MATT: She doesn't need to. With her speed she gets
onto the ship there.

02:54:54.357 --> 02:55:00.084
TRAVIS: Right, and she will assume the Dodge
whatever in case they throw fire or something at her.

02:55:00.084 --> 02:55:05.852
MATT: Okay. That brings us to the top of the
round. Fjord, your go.

02:55:05.852 --> 02:55:09.681
TRAVIS: I'm going to Arnold Schwarzernegger from
True Lies run and jump off the dock and dive into

02:55:09.681 --> 02:55:14.209
the water, heading straight towards the boat in a
straight line because my speed is the same on land

02:55:14.209 --> 02:55:17.952
or in the water and I will double dash to the
boat.

02:55:19.132 --> 02:55:20.783
LIAM: Into the abyss.

02:55:20.783 --> 02:55:21.843
LAURA: Bloop!

02:55:22.754 --> 02:55:24.694
LIAM: Oh man, all in one movement? That's--

02:55:24.694 --> 02:55:25.945
MARISHA: That's rad.

02:55:25.945 --> 02:55:28.898
TRAVIS: I'll be like, "We're getting the fuck out
of here. Shove off!"

02:55:30.276 --> 02:55:36.373
MATT: As you do that, the guards are going, "Hey!
Hey! Halt!" and they're drawing and loading

02:55:36.521 --> 02:55:39.910
crossbows. You are not stopping, you are not
hailing, you are not listening to anything they're

02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:43.107
saying. They assume you are stealing a ship. Which
you are.

02:55:43.107 --> 02:55:44.340
SAM: Which we are.

02:55:44.340 --> 02:55:46.539
(laughter)

02:55:46.539 --> 02:55:49.181
TALIESIN: Am I going to be the only survivor in
this? This'll be funny.

02:55:49.181 --> 02:55:50.884
MATT: The sails are unfurled.

02:55:50.884 --> 02:55:51.814
SAM: <i>Sail!</i>

02:55:51.814 --> 02:55:56.478
MATT: It's still anchored,
you notice as you get to the dock.

02:55:56.655 --> 02:55:58.494
TRAVIS: Are we tied up, too?

02:55:58.494 --> 02:56:02.107
MATT: Yeah. They were just starting to get the
process going of getting the ship done, and there

02:56:02.107 --> 02:56:05.661
is still somebody down inside rummaging through
the interior.

02:56:05.661 --> 02:56:08.262
SAM: We're off! (unsuccessful noise)

02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:12.339
MATT: Yeah. You as a sailor, you get there and
asses the situation and you're like, "This is

02:56:12.339 --> 02:56:15.169
going to take a little bit to get the boat out of
here."

02:56:15.169 --> 02:56:16.614
SAM: No problem.

02:56:16.614 --> 02:56:20.110
MATT: I mean, through natural means. I don't know
what you have at your disposal, but--

02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:22.511
TRAVIS: I set the boat on fire and kill us all.

02:56:22.511 --> 02:56:24.607
(laughter)

02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:26.029
TRAVIS: Bury our shame.

02:56:26.029 --> 02:56:29.390
MATT: All right, so you've taken your dodge
action. All the bowmen are gone. That brings us to

02:56:29.390 --> 02:56:31.037
Beau and Nott.

02:56:31.037 --> 02:56:39.843
MARISHA: I run over and I untie the boat from the
thing. I undo the rope. Are we hitched to the dock

02:56:39.843 --> 02:56:42.113
with rope? And anchor?

02:56:42.113 --> 02:56:44.265
MATT: Yeah, you're tied onto the side, and then
there's an anchor off the side.

02:56:44.265 --> 02:56:48.986
MARISHA: With a cleat, or whatever they're called?
I work on that because I'm assuming the anchor is heavy.

02:56:49.164 --> 02:56:53.822
MATT: You managed to pull it up. Make a Strength
check to see if you can get it all the way up.

02:56:53.822 --> 02:56:56.911
MARISHA: The anchor? Okay, that's opposite from
what I said.

02:56:56.911 --> 02:56:58.669
MATT: Oh, sorry, I misunderstood. You go ahead--

02:56:58.669 --> 02:57:02.320
MARISHA: I'm trying to undo-- do I also have time
to get the anchor up?

02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:05.851
MATT: Not both. It's an action to untie and get it
off the dock.

02:57:05.851 --> 02:57:10.499
MARISHA: I will focus on untying and getting it
off, and then I do the thing that you do where you

02:57:10.499 --> 02:57:14.991
push on the side of the dock, and I try and get us
like (grunt of effort).

02:57:14.991 --> 02:57:19.494
MATT: Okay, so you shove off a bit. There's still
a good distance. The gangplank is there, so it's

02:57:19.494 --> 02:57:25.035
not right up against the dock per se. There's not
much you can push off of but you do manage to get

02:57:25.035 --> 02:57:26.303
it untied.

02:57:26.303 --> 02:57:28.852
MARISHA: I get it untied. The boat's untied.

02:57:28.852 --> 02:57:30.304
MATT: All right. Nott?

02:57:30.517 --> 02:57:32.463
LAURA: This is <i>the</i> stupidest thing.

02:57:32.624 --> 02:57:34.828
MATT: This is great. This is D&D,
motherfuckers.

02:57:35.127 --> 02:57:36.590
LAURA: The dumbest--

02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:40.511
SAM: So we can't launch. We've got five or six
guards coming at us.

02:57:41.193 --> 02:57:44.357
LIAM: Vox Machina is dead, long live Vox Machina.

02:57:44.357 --> 02:57:47.310
MARISHA: Yeah, they thought Vox Machina were
assholes.

02:57:47.310 --> 02:57:49.680
LIAM: Yeah, oh man.

02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:52.879
MATT: Well, there were a few times that Vox
Machina was in this territory.

02:57:52.879 --> 02:57:55.339
LIAM: Sure, but this is our MO.

02:57:56.069 --> 02:57:59.843
SAM: Wow. I mean, I've got to get on that boat,
right?

02:58:01.275 --> 02:58:03.224
LAURA: Save yourself! Run away!

02:58:03.224 --> 02:58:06.379
SAM: Are there any more moorings or-- did she get
off--

02:58:06.836 --> 02:58:09.663
MATT: She managed to untie it from the dock
itself.

02:58:09.663 --> 02:58:12.846
SAM: But the gangplank is holding us on?

02:58:12.846 --> 02:58:14.346
MATT: No, the gangplank is still resting--

02:58:14.346 --> 02:58:17.044
SAM: It's just resting there, so if we get moving,
it'll just fall.

02:58:17.044 --> 02:58:18.298
MATT: Probably.

02:58:18.298 --> 02:58:29.416
SAM: Okay. I'll dash across the gangplank to get
on the boat and-- jesus, how do we get rid of

02:58:29.416 --> 02:58:30.737
these guys?

02:58:30.737 --> 02:58:33.018
(laughter)

02:58:34.728 --> 02:58:41.838
SAM: I will-- how far away am I? Ten, 20, 30. I
don't know, I'll cast Silent Image.

02:58:42.090 --> 02:58:43.733
MATT: Okay.

02:58:43.733 --> 02:58:58.632
I'll make an image of that captain guy at the end 
of the dock, or something, trying to hail them down.

02:58:58.632 --> 02:59:02.212
Not saying anything. Just doing this.

02:59:02.212 --> 02:59:06.624
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Nott. We'll
say it appears--

02:59:06.624 --> 02:59:08.274
SAM: Bonus action hide!

02:59:08.274 --> 02:59:10.216
MATT: There you go. Right there at the edge of the
dock.

02:59:10.216 --> 02:59:11.384
SAM: Great.

02:59:11.384 --> 02:59:13.512
MATT: All right. That brings us to Jester.

02:59:13.512 --> 02:59:15.404
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to--

02:59:15.404 --> 02:59:20.327
MATT: You see the guards. They're arming
crossbows. They're running towards the dock. One

02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:26.187
of them has his hands up, hailing, "Hey, hey!" and
is trying to get your attention. What are you doing?

02:59:26.187 --> 02:59:32.096
LAURA: I'm going to crouch down, and I'm going to
cast Invoke Duplicity.

02:59:32.312 --> 02:59:37.791
MATT: Okay. Where do you want it?

02:59:37.791 --> 02:59:46.878
LAURA: Next to me, where I crouched down from. I'm
going to have her pop up and run across the gangplank.

02:59:47.608 --> 02:59:48.608
MATT: Okay.

02:59:51.538 --> 02:59:59.076
Very obviously run over and look like
she's running over here and hiding.

02:59:59.345 --> 03:00:00.341
MATT: Okay.

03:00:01.986 --> 03:00:07.511
I'm going to stay as hidden as I can 
on the boat, crouched down so nobody can see me.

03:00:07.511 --> 03:00:08.952
MATT: Good to know.

03:00:08.952 --> 03:00:11.075
LIAM: Hey Matt, that white ring is just leftovers,
right?

03:00:11.075 --> 03:00:12.879
MATT: No, that's the illusion.

03:00:12.879 --> 03:00:17.306
SAM: That's the illusory captain that I just made
appear at the end of the dock.

03:00:17.306 --> 03:00:18.735
MATT: All right.

03:00:18.735 --> 03:00:28.164
LIAM: My turn? I give the Glove of Blasting a good
tug and I send three arcs of fire up into the air,

03:00:28.164 --> 03:00:33.864
and they spiral around each other and crash down
onto the dock about five to ten feet behind that

03:00:33.864 --> 03:00:38.465
illusion, and blast into the dock.

03:00:38.465 --> 03:00:40.228
LAURA: (whispers) That's good.

03:00:40.353 --> 03:00:46.952
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack for the AC
of wood, which isn't terribly high.

03:00:46.952 --> 03:00:48.785
MARISHA: The AC of wood!

03:00:48.785 --> 03:00:50.321
MATT: It is. It has an AC.

03:00:50.321 --> 03:00:52.756
LIAM: That's a 24.

03:00:52.756 --> 03:00:53.816
MATT: That hits.

03:00:53.816 --> 03:00:58.051
LIAM: Okay. (gasps) Second's a natural one!

03:00:58.051 --> 03:01:00.752
MATT: Hits the water. (sploosh)

03:01:00.752 --> 03:01:03.606
LIAM: Other one is way high, natural 17.

03:01:03.606 --> 03:01:05.471
MATT: Okay. So two hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:01:07.661 --> 03:01:08.832
LIAM: Low rolls.

03:01:12.136 --> 03:01:13.808
12 damage.

03:01:13.808 --> 03:01:19.740
MATT: 12 damage. All right. (explosions) The dock
splinters and bits of it char and burn and go

03:01:19.740 --> 03:01:25.025
flying. It (cracks) but it's still standing. It
wasn't enough to destroy the entire dock. It's

03:01:25.025 --> 03:01:25.889
damaged.

03:01:25.889 --> 03:01:28.822
LIAM: Okay, I will use my movement to (zip) inside
the boat.

03:01:28.822 --> 03:01:33.628
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) You vanish inside the
interior of the cabin, pushing past Beau, who's

03:01:33.628 --> 03:01:35.420
been holding the door shut.

03:01:35.420 --> 03:01:37.189
SAM: Wow, what do you see down there?

03:01:37.189 --> 03:01:40.482
MATT: As soon as you come down inside, there's a
lantern, and there's one of the Enforcers, who you

03:01:40.482 --> 03:01:42.343
can see is burning papers.

03:01:42.343 --> 03:01:44.621
(gasps)

03:01:44.621 --> 03:01:47.166
MATT: He turns around and sees you.

03:01:47.166 --> 03:01:49.583
LIAM: Can I use a cantrip?

03:01:49.583 --> 03:01:51.111
MATT: You have a bonus action cantrip?

03:01:51.111 --> 03:01:55.812
LIAM: Oh no I don't, never mind. Never mind.
Getting the hang of it. Good good good. Done.

03:01:55.812 --> 03:02:02.968
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn. That
comes to the guards. The guards, the one who was

03:02:02.968 --> 03:02:10.531
putting his hands up and was shouting, "Hey!" to
hail you, and was asking what's going on, has no

03:02:10.531 --> 03:02:15.162
choice but to assume that you're destroying the
dock and stealing a ship now. Because you are.

03:02:15.162 --> 03:02:20.033
He's going instead to pull out his heavy crossbow,
and load it. They're going to move up to the side here.

03:02:22.774 --> 03:02:25.928
SAM: Remember how, Jester, you couldn't come back
to this town?

03:02:25.928 --> 03:02:27.274
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:02:27.274 --> 03:02:32.156
(laughter)

03:02:32.156 --> 03:02:40.496
SAM: Well now we <i>all</i> can't. You're never going
to see your mom again. Sorry.

03:02:43.236 --> 03:02:48.773
MATT: The weird butterfly effect of D&D actions.

03:02:48.773 --> 03:02:51.369
TRAVIS: This was just <i>fucked</i> from the first.

03:02:51.369 --> 03:02:53.935
SAM: We were just going to have a conversation
with them.

03:02:53.935 --> 03:02:58.098
MATT: All right, so the guards are going to go
ahead and they're all going to fire.

03:02:58.098 --> 03:03:01.293
LAURA: I'm crouched down.

03:03:01.293 --> 03:03:02.814
SAM: I'm hiding as well.

03:03:02.814 --> 03:03:09.484
MATT: It's going to be two against you, Fjord, two
against Yasha, and one against Marius.

03:03:09.484 --> 03:03:13.674
SAM: (whispers) Oh no. What if Marius dies?

03:03:13.674 --> 03:03:16.566
MATT: Against Fjord, that is a 15 and a 17.

03:03:16.566 --> 03:03:18.398
TRAVIS: 17 will hit, 15 misses.

03:03:18.398 --> 03:03:22.340
MATT: All righty. You take six points of piercing
damage.

03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:25.239
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:03:25.239 --> 03:03:32.939
MATT: Both against Jester... terrible rolls. That
is a 12 and ten. They both just (whiff) past. Oh

03:03:32.939 --> 03:03:34.751
no, those were against Yasha.

03:03:34.751 --> 03:03:36.532
LAURA: Yeah, because I'm crouched.

03:03:36.532 --> 03:03:40.302
MATT: They could have seen you but Yasha was the
bigger threat, but it still misses Yasha. Last one

03:03:40.302 --> 03:03:47.717
against Marius misses, surprisingly, with a
natural seven. He's just (yelps) and he's looking

03:03:47.717 --> 03:03:55.213
at all this happening. He looks freaked out.
That's going to end the guards' turn. Caduceus. As

03:03:55.213 --> 03:03:56.031
you are--

03:03:56.031 --> 03:04:03.833
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Disguise Self. I'm
going to look like a-- I seem to recall-- I'm

03:04:04.166 --> 03:04:09.177
going to make a composite of the most pirate-y--
I've decided everyone who's on a boat is a pirate,

03:04:09.177 --> 03:04:16.349
so I'm going to make the most pirate-y, drunken
old man I possibly can. I'm going to give myself a

03:04:16.349 --> 03:04:26.657
big, white beard, crazy hair, very unthreatening,
buggy eyes. I'm going to continue to circle around the--

03:04:26.657 --> 03:04:30.685
MATT: 30. That gets you just--

03:04:30.685 --> 03:04:33.033
SAM: And that was the last time we ever saw
Caduceus.

03:04:33.033 --> 03:04:34.538
(laughter)

03:04:34.538 --> 03:04:36.822
LIAM: Fuck those idiots.

03:04:36.822 --> 03:04:43.221
TALIESIN: I'm figuring I'm going to have to find
you guys at some point, but yeah, this is... It's

03:04:43.221 --> 03:04:45.293
the only way I know how to get to the water,
so...

03:04:45.293 --> 03:04:47.840
LIAM: (as Caduceus) That was interesting. That was
really great.

03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:50.676
MATT: Finds his own adventure!

03:04:50.676 --> 03:04:53.204
(laughter)

03:04:53.204 --> 03:04:54.728
TALIESIN: I don't have a better way around--

03:04:54.728 --> 03:04:55.462
MATT: No, that's it--

03:04:55.462 --> 03:04:59.209
TALIESIN: Unless there's a window. Unless there's
an open passage on the back of one of those houses.

03:04:59.209 --> 03:05:03.454
MATT: There is. It's a closed window, but you
could try and break it.

03:05:03.454 --> 03:05:04.755
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's too--

03:05:04.755 --> 03:05:07.266
MATT: Okay, so you're over on that side. That's
the end of your turn.

03:05:07.486 --> 03:05:09.338
MARISHA: Just add B&E to the list.

03:05:09.338 --> 03:05:12.102
MATT: Why not? Just go all in! Yasha...

03:05:12.102 --> 03:05:14.339
TALIESIN: That's the best I got right now.

03:05:14.339 --> 03:05:16.630
TRAVIS: We want to pull up the anchor or are we
moving yet?

03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:21.500
MARISHA: I only unfurled, so if Yasha can yank up
that anchor, that'd be dope.

03:05:21.500 --> 03:05:26.526
MATT: All right, so Yasha goes over to the side,
pulls it up (grunts). Gets it on the inside.

03:05:26.526 --> 03:05:29.450
MARISHA: Now we're ready to go.

03:05:29.450 --> 03:05:32.071
MATT: You're now currently not tethered to--

03:05:32.071 --> 03:05:36.042
TRAVIS: With her movement, she'll stand in front
of Marius like a human shield. From any arrows

03:05:36.042 --> 03:05:38.158
that might be coming.

03:05:38.158 --> 03:05:42.400
MATT: Okay. She's trying her best to protect
Marius.

03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:44.292
SAM: Now we've just got to wait for the wind,
guys.

03:05:44.292 --> 03:05:48.046
(laughter)

03:05:48.046 --> 03:05:49.968
LAURA: Where's Keyleth when you need her?

03:05:49.968 --> 03:05:54.278
MATT: I would say, yeah. The time you really miss
the Air Ashari... All right. Now it's Marius's

03:05:54.278 --> 03:06:00.543
turn. What Marius was going to do, he can't do
now. Well, he might try.

03:06:00.543 --> 03:06:03.000
LAURA: He's going to jump in the water.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:06.585
MARISHA: Please don't be a dumbass. Marius.

03:06:06.585 --> 03:06:10.758
MATT: No, no. Hold on. Marius moves past Yasha.

03:06:10.758 --> 03:06:14.681
TRAVIS: Do I get an attack of bitch slapping?

03:06:14.681 --> 03:06:23.996
MATT: He gets up to the top of the edge of the
ship. And... let me roll for him to see if--

03:06:23.996 --> 03:06:31.091
that's actually pretty good, okay. He glances
about the scenario, takes in his chances and

03:06:31.091 --> 03:06:36.982
what's happening, and stands up and goes, "Hold!
Hold please! This is a <i>big</i> misunderstanding!

03:06:36.982 --> 03:06:39.308
"Let's talk this out!"

03:06:39.308 --> 03:06:40.951
SAM: To us, or everybody?

03:06:40.951 --> 03:06:47.681
MATT: To the guards. For the sake of this, I'm
going to have one of you guys roll for him. Who

03:06:47.681 --> 03:06:49.131
wants to roll his--

03:06:49.131 --> 03:06:50.692
SAM: I will roll.

03:06:50.692 --> 03:06:53.213
MATT: Persuasion check with disadvantage.

03:06:53.213 --> 03:06:55.754
SAM: Terrible. Both were threes.

03:06:55.754 --> 03:06:57.685
MATT: No.

03:06:57.685 --> 03:07:00.524
LAURA: Why did you roll? Why didn't <i>you</i> roll?!

03:07:00.524 --> 03:07:06.830
MATT: Because it would make it more interesting.
Okay, yeah, that's not having any effect on them.

03:07:06.830 --> 03:07:09.674
They're beyond convincing now, it looks like.

03:07:09.674 --> 03:07:12.390
MARISHA: He just made himself a giant target.
"Wait!"

03:07:12.390 --> 03:07:16.479
MATT: Yeah, he did. But, you know. That finishes
the round. Fjord, you're up.

03:07:16.479 --> 03:07:20.741
TRAVIS: I go up and I kick Marius in the water--
no.

03:07:20.741 --> 03:07:24.981
(laughter)

03:07:24.981 --> 03:07:36.337
TRAVIS: I don't fucking know. Can I double dash
down into the bow of the-- or belowdecks, where

03:07:36.337 --> 03:07:37.586
Caleb is?

03:07:37.586 --> 03:07:38.501
MATT: Sure.

03:07:38.501 --> 03:07:39.318
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

03:07:39.318 --> 03:07:42.541
MATT: Okay, you make your way down, and you join
up at the side of Caleb. You can see now, the

03:07:42.541 --> 03:07:46.027
Enforcer that's there, throwing the paper that's
currently burning onto the table and he's pulling

03:07:46.027 --> 03:07:47.199
a weapon out and he's--

03:07:47.199 --> 03:07:48.948
TRAVIS: Do I have an action or did I double dash
to get down here?

03:07:48.948 --> 03:07:52.247
MATT: You said double dash. It would have taken
that to get there, so. All right.

03:07:52.247 --> 03:07:58.741
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll use my bonus action to cast
Hexblade's Curse on that Enforcer. With the hope

03:07:58.741 --> 03:08:00.635
that he will soon be dead.

03:08:00.635 --> 03:08:06.354
MATT: All right. Now, as he sees you and he's
pulling the blade, you rush into the fray, and

03:08:06.641 --> 03:08:11.303
what heavy shadows still lie in the bottom here,
with the little bit of lantern and fire light

03:08:11.303 --> 03:08:15.088
that's lighting the space, the shadows get darker
around him, and you can see everyone's breath is

03:08:15.088 --> 03:08:21.268
visible suddenly in this under chamber as the
curse takes its hold on him. That goes to Beau and Nott.

03:08:21.268 --> 03:08:28.409
MARISHA: Okay, I go over to the rope of the sail
and I pull it tight-- and the jib-- I don't know.

03:08:28.409 --> 03:08:31.154
I do something, and I go, "Fjord!"

03:08:31.154 --> 03:08:33.055
MATT: Beau has never been on a ship.

03:08:33.055 --> 03:08:35.002
MARISHA: "Fjord, how do I sail?!"

03:08:35.002 --> 03:08:37.051
MATT: The one sailor is below deck right now.

03:08:37.051 --> 03:08:39.732
MARISHA: "Fjord!" I still try--

03:08:39.732 --> 03:08:44.035
TRAVIS: I'm going.

03:08:44.035 --> 03:08:46.030
(laughter)

03:08:46.030 --> 03:08:47.154
TALIESIN: Aw, man.

03:08:47.154 --> 03:08:49.776
MARISHA: I do what I think--

03:08:49.776 --> 03:08:51.239
SAM: Yeah, yeah! Tie that there!

03:08:51.239 --> 03:08:52.418
MARISHA: Tie that? Okay!

03:08:52.418 --> 03:08:54.116
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

03:08:54.116 --> 03:08:55.923
MARISHA: Okay.

03:08:55.923 --> 03:08:57.552
SAM: Do the winch!

03:08:57.552 --> 03:09:03.310
MARISHA: Do the-- what's the jib? Do I jib or do I
winch? Wait, why am I rolling-- which one? Pick

03:09:03.310 --> 03:09:09.548
one! I'm going to do jade, lucky jade, lucky jade.
Okay, okay! That was good! 19 total.

03:09:09.548 --> 03:09:15.633
MATT: Okay, you look at it. You've been watching
boats come into harbor, and you've read things

03:09:15.633 --> 03:09:19.325
about it, but mostly from your observational
skills, which is one of your focuses and

03:09:19.325 --> 03:09:26.220
strengths, Beauregard, you're like, "Okay, I think
I've seen people, you know, making ships go." You

03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:33.155
grab the ropes, you pull, and you yank past, and
you watch as the sail picks up the wind and stiffens.

03:09:33.155 --> 03:09:36.830
MARISHA: (accented) "We've caught the wind!" I've
heard sailors say that.

03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:43.352
MATT: It's like-- Beau, for those purposes, up on
the top, there, holding the rope, and you're like,

03:09:43.352 --> 03:09:45.950
"Ah, okay, there's a sail!"

03:09:45.950 --> 03:09:49.358
MARISHA: There's like a rudder, right? Nott,
rudder, the boat!

03:09:49.358 --> 03:09:51.311
SAM: I hate water!

03:09:51.311 --> 03:09:55.162
(laughter)

03:09:55.162 --> 03:09:57.426
MATT: Nott, what are you doing?

03:09:57.426 --> 03:10:04.880
SAM: Is anything constraining our movement? Is the
gangplank in our way? Or are we unfettered at this point?

03:10:05.057 --> 03:10:08.165
MATT: As far as you know, the gangplank is resting
on there. You don't know if it's connected at all.

03:10:08.165 --> 03:10:09.693
SAM: We're starting to drift a little?

03:10:09.693 --> 03:10:12.551
MATT: You're starting to drift a little bit. The
wind has picked up a little bit.

03:10:12.551 --> 03:10:25.549
SAM: Okay. Then I will run up and tackle Marius to
the ground and wrestle him down. Get over here,

03:10:25.549 --> 03:10:29.085
you fucking-- Get-- Come on! Get down! We're
trying to talk to you!

03:10:29.085 --> 03:10:31.416
MATT: Make an athletics check to grapple.

03:10:31.416 --> 03:10:37.657
SAM: Ooh, wow. Athletics. Oh, that's just a
straight 18.

03:10:37.657 --> 03:10:45.248
MATT: Straight 18. Yeah. Like a wet paper bag, he
goes over, "Ah!" (boof) and they both slam onto

03:10:45.388 --> 03:10:52.319
the deck below. You have him grappled and you're
like holding him down. You're not-- you don't

03:10:52.319 --> 03:10:57.721
weigh a lot, but you're leveraging and pulling the
weight in a way where he can't-- his knees are

03:10:57.721 --> 03:11:02.741
buckled and he can't actually get any ground to
hold himself up, so. You got him.

03:11:02.741 --> 03:11:04.167
SAM: Okay. That's all I got.

03:11:04.167 --> 03:11:09.043
MATT: All right. The Enforcer who's below, who has
the curse, is going to go ahead and swing forward

03:11:09.043 --> 03:11:14.842
two attacks with his blade. This is going to be...
this is going to be against you, Fjord, because

03:11:14.842 --> 03:11:16.265
you're the one that came in and cursed him.

03:11:16.265 --> 03:11:18.375
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, yeah.

03:11:18.375 --> 03:11:21.459
MATT: That's going to be a 15 to hit.

03:11:21.459 --> 03:11:22.569
TRAVIS: It misses.

03:11:22.569 --> 03:11:25.669
MATT: (impact) Shield off to one side. Natural
19.

03:11:25.669 --> 03:11:27.084
TRAVIS: It hits.

03:11:27.084 --> 03:11:30.358
SAM: This is your, like, favored terrain and
stuff. It's a boat.

03:11:30.358 --> 03:11:31.310
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:11:31.310 --> 03:11:33.329
TALIESIN: This is a disaster.

03:11:33.329 --> 03:11:37.434
MATT: That is ten points of slashing damage.

03:11:37.434 --> 03:11:42.817
TRAVIS: I'm uncon-- No, I'll use my Relentless
En-fucking-[slurred]

03:11:42.817 --> 03:11:44.275
SAM: We're going to lose the sailor.

03:11:44.275 --> 03:11:45.981
(laughter)

03:11:45.981 --> 03:11:48.532
TRAVIS: Well, I'm up to one hit point.

03:11:48.532 --> 03:11:49.739
LAURA: Seriously?

03:11:49.739 --> 03:11:53.825
MATT: You (groan). You just manage to hold on by a
thread. Your consciousness waning, your eyes focus

03:11:53.825 --> 03:11:56.414
angrily towards the target of your Hexblade's
Curse.

03:11:56.414 --> 03:12:00.067
TRAVIS: Just out of pity's sake. I'm disappointed
I came back up to one hit point.

03:12:00.067 --> 03:12:02.675
LAURA: I don't even know that's happening.

03:12:02.675 --> 03:12:04.244
SAM and TALIESIN: No.

03:12:04.244 --> 03:12:07.051
MATT: All right. That brings us to Jester's turn.

03:12:07.051 --> 03:12:13.372
LAURA: Great. I'm going to use my Duplicate to run
forward...

03:12:13.382 --> 03:12:15.512
MARISHA: What are we doing?

03:12:16.652 --> 03:12:20.424
SAM: We're saving the world, Marisha, we're saving
the world.

03:12:20.424 --> 03:12:27.989
LAURA: I'm going to use my Pearl of Power to cast
my last remaining 3rd-level spell, and I'm going

03:12:27.989 --> 03:12:34.447
to cast Charm Person on the three of the guards
that I can see.

03:12:34.447 --> 03:12:36.664
MATT: Okay. Ones up front?

03:12:36.664 --> 03:12:38.139
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

03:12:38.139 --> 03:12:41.113
MATT: The one up here is the leader, the one that
was guiding them on stuff.

03:12:41.113 --> 03:12:43.066
LAURA: Okay, yeah, that's good.

03:12:43.066 --> 03:12:50.306
MATT: He fails with a natural three. Two natural
threes in a row! Fucking lucky. The third one on

03:12:50.306 --> 03:12:58.079
the far end... is a natural six. Okay. So. You are
currently-- oh no, it's not concentration for

03:12:58.079 --> 03:13:01.935
Charm Person. Those three are charmed.

03:13:01.935 --> 03:13:03.837
LAURA: For an hour.

03:13:03.837 --> 03:13:08.336
SAM: We're doing great, guys! We've killed
everybody, we're charming people, we're on a boat.

03:13:08.336 --> 03:13:12.284
MATT: They are technically in combat with you.

03:13:12.284 --> 03:13:15.856
SAM: Is Frumpkin an octopus and is it lying back
on the dock somewhere?

03:13:15.856 --> 03:13:17.315
LIAM: Frumpkin is <i>not</i> there.

03:13:17.315 --> 03:13:18.627
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:13:18.627 --> 03:13:22.304
LAURA: It is charmed by you until the spell ends
or until your companions do anything harmful to

03:13:22.304 --> 03:13:28.738
it. When the spell ends-- It doesn't say anything
about it not being in combat.

03:13:28.738 --> 03:13:32.344
MATT: Makes a wisdom saving throw and does so with
advantage if you or your companions are fighting it.

03:13:32.344 --> 03:13:35.011
LAURA: Oh, okay. It doesn't say that on the
thingy. Sorry.

03:13:35.556 --> 03:13:37.838
TALIESIN: Although they haven't technically
attacked... Oh, no.

03:13:37.838 --> 03:13:42.542
MATT: Yeah, there's been enough aggressive action,
they're considered fighting. They've all failed

03:13:42.542 --> 03:13:47.929
their save. I'm going to do one more roll for all
of them. The leader-- that's cocked. That's a

03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:50.196
natural 12 plus two, 14. What's your DC?

03:13:50.196 --> 03:13:51.310
LAURA: 15!

03:13:51.310 --> 03:13:58.203
MATT: 15. That's a natural ten and a natural 11!
They all fail again. Yeah, they're all still

03:13:58.203 --> 03:14:00.378
charmed. Well done.

03:14:00.378 --> 03:14:01.804
SAM: What are the odds?

03:14:01.804 --> 03:14:06.735
MATT: That's kind of crazy, actually. All right,
so we'll say the red here is Charm Person.

03:14:09.835 --> 03:14:14.391
MARISHA: I can feel Travis's Dad disappointment,
like radiating--

03:14:14.808 --> 03:14:15.490
SAM: In himself?

03:14:15.490 --> 03:14:16.527
TRAVIS: In myself, yeah.

03:14:16.527 --> 03:14:17.258
SAM: And in us?

03:14:17.258 --> 03:14:18.331
MARISHA: It's hot.

03:14:18.331 --> 03:14:23.459
MATT: The three of them drop their weapons for a
second and are looking confused. The ones

03:14:23.459 --> 03:14:26.193
behind are still loading and getting ready.

03:14:26.193 --> 03:14:36.679
LAURA: Okay. I guess I'm going to stay hidden on
my end and try to make my way down. I can't do

03:14:36.679 --> 03:14:43.884
anything below, but okay, whatever, yeah. Yeah, I
guess I'm going to try to go-- No, because I'm

03:14:43.884 --> 03:14:47.178
going to keep visual on Duplicate Jester. I'm
going to stay hidden on the top.

03:14:47.178 --> 03:14:49.598
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Jester. Caleb.

03:14:49.598 --> 03:14:55.505
LIAM: <i>Ja</i> I rub a bit of honey across my lip and
say, "<i>Mein Freund</i>, I suggest you throw down your

03:14:55.622 --> 03:14:59.756
weapons and lie under that desk, just for your
safety," and I cast Suggestion.

03:14:59.756 --> 03:15:08.958
MATT: Okay. This is a natural seven, that's a
failure. After slashing into Fjord and turning

03:15:08.958 --> 03:15:14.393
towards you and seeing that fall, he throws his
weapon down and crawls under the table angrily,

03:15:14.393 --> 03:15:21.649
like "Grr, I'm going to get you under this table!"
and then he gets there and looks very confused.

03:15:21.649 --> 03:15:26.260
LIAM: I would like to use movement to zip up to
the top and look around.

03:15:26.260 --> 03:15:33.451
MATT: Let's see here. Yeah, we'll say that's what
his next action would be, since technically it's

03:15:33.451 --> 03:15:35.457
out of turn.

03:15:35.457 --> 03:15:37.477
LIAM: You mean climbing under the desk?

03:15:37.477 --> 03:15:39.911
MATT: Yeah. It's happening simultaneously.

03:15:39.911 --> 03:15:45.175
LIAM: I use my movement to zip up and look around
and my bonus action to zip back down into the boat.

03:15:45.737 --> 03:15:48.781
MATT: You look up and you see this scenario. You
see the guards are still standing there at the

03:15:48.781 --> 03:15:52.390
edge. The ship is moving, it's slowly pulling
away.

03:15:52.390 --> 03:15:54.414
LAURA: Don't hit those guys in the front.

03:15:54.414 --> 03:16:02.869
MATT: That brings us to the guards' turn. The two
in the back are going to go ahead and fire. That's

03:16:02.869 --> 03:16:11.817
going to be one at Beau and one at Yasha. Against
Beau, that is a 17 to hit.

03:16:11.817 --> 03:16:13.317
MARISHA: Miss.

03:16:13.317 --> 03:16:18.245
MATT: Against Yasha, that is a 16 to hit. I
believe that does hit. She doesn't have a huge

03:16:18.245 --> 03:16:23.823
armor class, if I recall. She does take only five
points of piercing damage.

03:16:23.823 --> 03:16:28.119
TRAVIS: Is that already halved because of raging?

03:16:28.119 --> 03:16:31.132
MATT: Well, she hasn't attacked anything.

03:16:31.132 --> 03:16:33.001
TRAVIS: You're right, that would fall. Yeah.

03:16:33.001 --> 03:16:36.843
MATT: Did she take damage last turn? Oh, she was
attacked last turn, so she's still raging.

03:16:36.843 --> 03:16:38.169
TRAVIS: Oh, she did.

03:16:38.169 --> 03:16:40.323
MATT: But there were a few rounds there where she
didn't hit anything, so the rage fell.

03:16:40.323 --> 03:16:44.840
LAURA: The guy that targeted Beau has to make a
wisdom saving throw.

03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:50.734
MATT: Oh, that's true. He fails, so he goes to
fire and he has to choose another target.

03:16:50.734 --> 03:16:52.929
LAURA: No, he just fails if on a fail--

03:16:52.929 --> 03:16:55.148
SAM: No, he can choose another target on
Sanctuary.

03:16:55.148 --> 03:17:05.269
MATT: It's okay. It's a 1st-level spell. Instead,
he's going to fire that at Yasha as well. Okay,

03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:11.036
that is a failure. That is a natural seven. No
damage outside of the damage that she took there.

03:17:11.036 --> 03:17:20.822
At that point, the leader goes, "Wait hold, what
are you doing? Stand back!" and the guy's like,

03:17:20.822 --> 03:17:26.554
"What are you talking about?" "Hold on. We have to
figure this out. Something is strange about this.

03:17:26.554 --> 03:17:32.070
"Hold up!" He starts shouting to hail in your
direction, and the other guards are putting their

03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:38.272
weapons away and are about to walk over. The two
in the back are like, "What?!"

03:17:38.272 --> 03:17:40.790
SAM: Wow.

03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:46.145
MATT: Yeah, they are not sure what's happening.
They are not perceptive enough to have seen that

03:17:46.145 --> 03:17:49.949
it's a spell effect that has changed them. They're
confused by it. We'll see if they figure it out

03:17:49.949 --> 03:17:58.190
soon. With that, these guys are going to begin to
walk and make their way toward the broken docks.

03:17:58.190 --> 03:18:00.627
LIAM: Possibly burning.

03:18:00.627 --> 03:18:05.317
MATT: They see the illusory guy there and look
confused.

03:18:05.317 --> 03:18:07.437
LAURA: It just looks like me, though.

03:18:07.437 --> 03:18:08.770
TALIESIN: No, there's another guy.

03:18:08.770 --> 03:18:15.698
MATT: There's the guy just waving to them. That's
all he's doing repeatedly. He's like one of those

03:18:15.698 --> 03:18:23.699
mannequins holding the electrical signs on the
street. Yeah, he's a wacky waving--

03:18:23.699 --> 03:18:25.832
TALIESIN: A wacky waver.

03:18:25.832 --> 03:18:27.591
MATT: A half-orc.

03:18:27.591 --> 03:18:31.597
LIAM: He's got the cardboard arrow, spinning it.

03:18:31.597 --> 03:18:32.391
TALIESIN: Freestyle.

03:18:32.391 --> 03:18:34.964
MATT: These guards are going to chase up confused
and they're going, "Sir! Sir! Sir!" and they're

03:18:34.964 --> 03:18:39.952
not entirely certain what's going on. They're
really confused by the scenario. That's going to

03:18:39.952 --> 03:18:41.074
go to Caduceus.

03:18:41.074 --> 03:18:45.228
TALIESIN: I'm going to NPC my ass right across the
street.

03:18:45.228 --> 03:18:46.621
MATT: 25, 30.

03:18:46.621 --> 03:18:51.144
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can take my action
and keep going quietly. Oh no, I'm not going

03:18:51.144 --> 03:18:54.663
that-- I'm going to go behind those. I'm getting
in the water.

03:18:54.663 --> 03:18:55.930
MATT: Oh, this way?

03:18:55.930 --> 03:18:57.904
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm getting in the water.

03:18:57.904 --> 03:18:59.336
SAM: In the water?

03:18:59.336 --> 03:18:59.912
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:18:59.912 --> 03:19:03.266
MATT: 25, 30.

03:19:03.266 --> 03:19:07.711
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently get in. Yeah, I'm
sitting in.

03:19:07.711 --> 03:19:09.033
MATT: It's a ten-foot drop.

03:19:09.033 --> 03:19:10.810
TALIESIN: Oh is it a ten-foot drop?

03:19:10.810 --> 03:19:11.496
MATT: Yep.

03:19:11.496 --> 03:19:13.371
LAURA: Can you lower yourself? You're pretty
tall.

03:19:13.371 --> 03:19:16.084
TALIESIN; Can I climb down instead of jumping?

03:19:16.084 --> 03:19:17.661
MATT: Sure, make an athletics check.

03:19:17.661 --> 03:19:19.959
TALIESIN: All right.

03:19:19.959 --> 03:19:21.817
LIAM: Is he Kaiju-sized?

03:19:21.817 --> 03:19:27.238
TALIESIN: I am very tiny looking right now. Come
on. Oh my god, that was almost terrible. Nine.

03:19:27.238 --> 03:19:34.713
MATT: Nine? You slip and fall a little bit. You
get down about five feet and you make a splash sound.

03:19:34.723 --> 03:19:37.014
TALIESIN: There's a lot happening.

03:19:37.014 --> 03:19:38.740
TRAVIS: The dock's on fire, for crying out loud.

03:19:38.740 --> 03:19:40.875
MATT: Yeah, they don't notice.

03:19:40.875 --> 03:19:45.535
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly start making my way
underneath everything, quietly and with--

03:19:45.535 --> 03:19:48.967
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20. Yeah, you're slowly
wading through the water.

03:19:48.967 --> 03:19:49.567
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:19:49.567 --> 03:19:52.586
MATT: Okay, that ends you're go. Yasha's turn.

03:19:52.586 --> 03:19:55.736
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to turn and bear hug
Marius.

03:19:55.736 --> 03:19:57.737
SAM: I'm already on him.

03:19:57.737 --> 03:20:02.046
TRAVIS: Awesome. She's going to assume the dodge--
Is there anything else to do?

03:20:02.046 --> 03:20:04.473
LAURA: Can she help try to get the ship to move
more?

03:20:04.473 --> 03:20:06.750
TALIESIN: Does she know boats?

03:20:06.750 --> 03:20:09.143
TRAVIS: Does Yasha know boats?

03:20:09.143 --> 03:20:12.369
MATT: Yasha, as far as you know, does not know
boats. She's never mentioned anything about it,

03:20:12.369 --> 03:20:17.534
and Yasha looks like she doesn't know what she's
doing. She's not giving orders, or rushing to take

03:20:17.534 --> 03:20:18.643
a post.

03:20:18.643 --> 03:20:21.576
TRAVIS: I mean, I suppose she could run over to
the gangplank and she could try to pull it and

03:20:21.576 --> 03:20:23.665
shove it against the dock and push off.

03:20:23.665 --> 03:20:26.482
SAM: The old plank shove.

03:20:26.482 --> 03:20:32.181
MATT: Yasha will go ahead and push on the
gangplank. Make a strength check for Yasha shoving off.

03:20:33.628 --> 03:20:34.386
TRAVIS: 26.

03:20:34.386 --> 03:20:40.919
MATT: She shoves and the whole boat shifts
suddenly. The gangplank plunges down into the

03:20:40.919 --> 03:20:47.733
water and it's floating there on the top. The ship
gets shoved off about ten feet in that direction.

03:20:47.733 --> 03:20:49.673
LIAM: Who could have predicted this?

03:20:50.448 --> 03:20:57.373
[music]

03:20:57.373 --> 03:21:05.054
Marius is just standing there, held by a goblin,
going, "Ah!"

03:21:05.054 --> 03:21:07.670
SAM: Stay down! Stay down!

03:21:07.881 --> 03:21:11.151
MATT: "All right, all right!", and he stays quiet
there, and doesn't do anything. Fjord?

03:21:11.151 --> 03:21:14.845
TRAVIS: I'll back up to the top of the ship, where
I should be useful.

03:21:14.845 --> 03:21:21.641
MATT: 15 feet of movement to get up there.

03:21:21.641 --> 03:21:23.953
TRAVIS: Do I have an action?

03:21:23.953 --> 03:21:26.865
MATT: You have 15 more feet of movement and you
have an action.

03:21:26.865 --> 03:21:29.132
TRAVIS: I'll climb up onto where the rudder is.

03:21:29.132 --> 03:21:32.227
LIAM: "Oh, you want this seafaring knowledge? What
can you give me?"

03:21:32.227 --> 03:21:35.247
MATT: You get up and man it.

03:21:35.247 --> 03:21:38.008
TRAVIS: I start turning the bow of the ship out
towards the sea.

03:21:38.008 --> 03:21:40.588
MATT: It starts arcing and making its way in that
direction, turning slowly.

03:21:40.588 --> 03:21:43.665
TRAVIS: I'm smashing my head into the fucking
bow.

03:21:43.665 --> 03:21:46.364
LAURA: Don't do it, you only have one hit point.

03:21:46.364 --> 03:21:54.241
TRAVIS: I fall unconscious. When I wake up this
will all be over. I do that.

03:21:54.241 --> 03:21:55.310
LAURA: No, you don't.

03:21:55.310 --> 03:21:56.288
TRAVIS: Yes, I do.

03:21:57.728 --> 03:21:58.920
LAURA: <i>Fjord.</i>

03:21:58.920 --> 03:22:01.858
LIAM: That's a bad idea.

03:22:01.858 --> 03:22:04.228
LAURA: Don't do that.

03:22:04.228 --> 03:22:05.706
TRAVIS: I do it.

03:22:05.706 --> 03:22:10.593
MATT: Okay. Fjord, in a fit of frustration and
anger, once the rudder is locked in place and the

03:22:10.593 --> 03:22:16.972
ship begins to turn in position, bashes his head
in very much a "This is so stupid!" movement.

03:22:16.972 --> 03:22:24.557
It doesn't knock you unconscious, but you are
dizzy as fuck. You have you hit your head real

03:22:24.557 --> 03:22:26.965
hard on there to do a point of damage. Do you want
to do that?

03:22:26.965 --> 03:22:28.879
TRAVIS: No, that's fine. Frustration's good
enough.

03:22:28.879 --> 03:22:31.908
MATT: Frustration, you'll hurt yourself, but to
take a point of damage?

03:22:31.908 --> 03:22:33.516
TRAVIS: Frustration's fine.

03:22:33.516 --> 03:22:39.058
MATT: You're like, "Ugh!" There's a little bit of
blood trickling out from where the head got mashed

03:22:39.058 --> 03:22:43.245
a little bit. The partially splintered wood from
the explosion of the Fireball earlier...

03:22:43.245 --> 03:22:46.082
LAURA: Oh god, are we going to sink?

03:22:46.082 --> 03:22:51.633
TALIESIN: Why would you say that out loud?! What's
wrong with you?!

03:22:52.913 --> 03:22:55.796
TRAVIS: No, that's appropriate for today.

03:22:55.796 --> 03:23:07.911
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. Now the ship is
moving on initiative 20. The ship moves out and is

03:23:08.182 --> 03:23:15.954
over there now, and is turning this way. That
brings us to Beau and Nott.

03:23:18.024 --> 03:23:22.901
MARISHA: I see Fjord bash his head against the
wall and I go, you guys, I think Fjord's under

03:23:23.153 --> 03:23:30.215
some sort of influence magic! He's not himself!
Then I yank the--

03:23:30.215 --> 03:23:32.793
MATT: You're just using your action to hold onto
the sail and keep it open.

03:23:32.793 --> 03:23:34.904
MARISHA: Tell me what to do!

03:23:34.904 --> 03:23:37.597
TRAVIS: Oh right, you don't know how to sail the
ship.

03:23:37.597 --> 03:23:39.171
MARISHA: You motherfucker!

03:23:39.171 --> 03:23:41.533
MATT: You're the only one, really.

03:23:41.533 --> 03:23:44.410
TRAVIS: Hoist the thing and then the other one.

03:23:44.410 --> 03:23:47.492
MARISHA: I try and interpret what he says. Hoist
the thing!

03:23:47.492 --> 03:23:50.970
MATT: Listening to the thing, you eventually get
her to figure it out. You get the sail situated,

03:23:50.970 --> 03:23:55.797
and that will be your action for the turn. Okay,
Nott?

03:23:55.797 --> 03:24:02.206
SAM: I will spend my action seeing if there's any
rope lying around, and trying to tie the man's

03:24:02.206 --> 03:24:03.602
hands up.

03:24:03.602 --> 03:24:10.730
MATT: There is a couple of coils of rope left
there in the far corner of the-- you'll have to

03:24:10.730 --> 03:24:12.526
release him to go get it.

03:24:12.526 --> 03:24:21.159
SAM: I will keep him and I will Mage Hand grab
some rope and bring it over to me, but then that

03:24:21.159 --> 03:24:23.159
will be my action.

03:24:23.159 --> 03:24:30.233
MATT: Still holding him, because he's keeping
quiet, the rope hovers over and plops next to you.

03:24:30.812 --> 03:24:34.561
SAM: Then bonus action, I will use Mage Hand to
start looping it around him.

03:24:34.561 --> 03:24:39.993
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and make a sleight of hand
check for me. Well, just a general dexterity

03:24:39.993 --> 03:24:44.202
check, actually. You're not proficient in this,
necessarily, so just add your dexterity modifier.

03:24:44.202 --> 03:24:45.336
SAM: Ten.

03:24:45.336 --> 03:24:47.548
MATT: Okay, you've begun the process. It's not an
immediate--

03:24:47.548 --> 03:24:52.458
SAM: Oh, wait. No, it's just a seven. That's bad.

03:24:52.458 --> 03:24:57.916
MATT: You're not a master of rope tying,
necessarily. This round, the ropes are slipping

03:24:57.916 --> 03:25:04.729
and while Marius is fighting against it a little
bit, you're not getting too much of a hold on it.

03:25:04.729 --> 03:25:15.450
All right, that ends your go. The Enforcer below,
who has completed the-- now is when he's ducked

03:25:15.450 --> 03:25:20.355
behind, because he lost his action to do that. He
now gets under the table, throws his weapon down,

03:25:20.355 --> 03:25:30.343
and goes, "What the fuck?" Goes to pick up the
weapon; that's his turn. Jester, you go. It's so ridiculous.

03:25:30.343 --> 03:25:32.593
LIAM: Did he just break it, is that what Caleb
saw?

03:25:32.593 --> 03:25:34.688
MARISHA: He realized he was being dumb.

03:25:34.688 --> 03:25:36.412
SAM: He's just doing it.

03:25:36.412 --> 03:25:37.823
LIAM: He's got to do it.

03:25:37.823 --> 03:25:39.582
MATT: No, but he performed the action.

03:25:39.582 --> 03:25:40.351
LIAM: Right.

03:25:45.931 --> 03:25:47.941
MATT: Yeah, spell ends.

03:25:47.941 --> 03:25:54.668
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my axe, the
duplicate, and I'm going to act like she hits

03:25:54.946 --> 03:26:01.297
herself with it-- so stupid-- and go (dying noise)
and falls into the water.

03:26:01.297 --> 03:26:03.473
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

03:26:03.473 --> 03:26:06.713
SAM: She commits suicide in front of him?

03:26:06.713 --> 03:26:12.865
MATT: The leader goes, "No!", who considers you a
friend at the moment and is seemingly really

03:26:12.865 --> 03:26:14.786
distraught to watch this happen.

03:26:14.786 --> 03:26:17.304
SAM: What is happening?

03:26:17.304 --> 03:26:20.174
LAURA: She's going to be floating in the water,
and then I'm going to go--

03:26:20.174 --> 03:26:22.470
MATT: I take it you're not concentrating on your
Silent Image anymore?

03:26:22.470 --> 03:26:31.080
SAM: I'm probably focusing on Marius? So no. I'm
not.

03:26:31.080 --> 03:26:39.666
MATT: Okay. That vanishes right as she kills
herself and falls into the water. Very confused.

03:26:39.666 --> 03:26:50.261
LAURA: Then I'm going to, for my action as Jester,
go and try to hold the door shut for the under--

03:26:50.261 --> 03:26:55.612
MATT: Okay. You move up to the door and-- holding
it there.

03:26:55.612 --> 03:26:58.694
LAURA: But I'm crawling, I don't want them to see
me.

03:26:58.694 --> 03:27:01.207
MATT: You're keeping low, yeah. It's half
movement, you still get there, and you're prone.

03:27:01.207 --> 03:27:02.841
All right, Caleb.

03:27:02.841 --> 03:27:06.328
LIAM: I just want to clarify. I thought that I had
told him to throw down his weapons and hide under

03:27:06.328 --> 03:27:08.973
the desk for his safety. That's not an ongoing
thing?

03:27:08.973 --> 03:27:10.232
MARISHA: He did that.

03:27:10.232 --> 03:27:12.868
LIAM: But you don't go down and then immediately
stand up and get out again, do you?

03:27:12.868 --> 03:27:14.428
MARISHA: He saved from the spell.

03:27:14.428 --> 03:27:16.344
LIAM: Oh, he saved from the spell?

03:27:16.344 --> 03:27:21.612
MATT: No. How it works is, you give them a task.
He went and hid under the table for safety, which

03:27:21.612 --> 03:27:22.654
he did.

03:27:22.654 --> 03:27:25.639
LIAM: Hiding under the table for six seconds is a
shitty job at hiding, but okay.

03:27:25.639 --> 03:27:29.177
MATT: But it wasn't specific enough. It wasn't a
very specific suggestion.

03:27:29.177 --> 03:27:44.769
LIAM: Okay, that's fine. I have to totally rethink
everything, so give me ten seconds. I will use my

03:27:44.769 --> 03:27:50.272
action to run forward and, with the edges of my
coat, put out the burning papers.

03:27:50.272 --> 03:27:55.072
LAURA: Are you downstairs? I thought you were
upstairs.

03:27:55.072 --> 03:28:02.018
MATT: No, you locked him down there. "You're in
here with me!" All right, you put out the fire.

03:28:02.018 --> 03:28:10.257
You can see now, it looks like what was a map that
is mostly burned entirely.

03:28:10.257 --> 03:28:15.472
LIAM: Do I see anything? As I'm doing this, yeah,
if I'm looking at it.

03:28:15.472 --> 03:28:20.078
MATT: On the map? Yeah, you see part of the Coast,
and you see some notes, and you see something on

03:28:20.078 --> 03:28:24.735
there. Clearly looking at it, there is information
on it, but you're putting it out, (blowing).

03:28:24.735 --> 03:28:31.463
LIAM: Okay, that's it, I'm done. I would say that
probably what I would've done, not knowing any of

03:28:31.463 --> 03:28:37.125
that, is zip up to go up and then see if the door
is shut and go-- and that's the end of my turn.

03:28:37.125 --> 03:28:43.313
MATT: That's going to be your turn. That brings us
to the guards' turn. The guards in the back are

03:28:43.313 --> 03:28:50.731
shaking the other guard, "What are you doing?
They're getting away!" He's like, "Look. This is a

03:28:50.731 --> 03:28:55.367
"very confusing scenario, and we're trying to
ascertain what's happening. They seem safe for

03:28:55.367 --> 03:28:57.879
"now, but why did this dock explode?"

03:28:57.879 --> 03:29:00.365
LAURA: Also, there's a girl floating in the
water.

03:29:00.365 --> 03:29:11.180
MATT: "She just killed herself, go check on her,
make sure she's okay!" The guard's like-- Natural

03:29:11.180 --> 03:29:17.637
20. They're like, "This is foul magic." He starts
slapping him in the face and he's like, "Get

03:29:17.637 --> 03:29:21.292
away," and he's like, "Call a mage, we have to get
this taken care of."

03:29:21.292 --> 03:29:25.307
TRAVIS: Ooh, the mage. A mage, or the mage?

03:29:25.307 --> 03:29:27.245
LAURA and LIAM: A mage.

03:29:27.245 --> 03:29:32.059
MATT: They start shouting for help. Frumpkin's
still hanging out over here. I figured you

03:29:32.059 --> 03:29:33.042
would've blinked Frumpkin.

03:29:33.042 --> 03:29:35.530
LIAM: Yeah, I was casting Find Familiar.

03:29:35.530 --> 03:29:41.397
MATT: You still have an octopus Frumpkin with you.
The guards are now--

03:29:41.397 --> 03:29:43.547
MARISHA: Yeah, it interrupted that with the
fight.

03:29:43.547 --> 03:29:48.889
MATT: Yeah. They're momentarily distracted by all
the things that have happened, the ship getting

03:29:48.889 --> 03:29:55.049
away and their leader's essentially acting really
dumb, and now ascertaining that it's magical, they

03:29:55.049 --> 03:30:00.663
don't know what to do, so they're starting to
shout out, and one of them's starting to leave and

03:30:00.663 --> 03:30:05.990
go to get help. They start darting this way,
shouting. These guys all begin to inspect and try

03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:09.919
to see if they can find the poor woman. This guy
dives into the water to try and see if he can save her.

03:30:09.930 --> 03:30:12.608
(laughter)

03:30:12.608 --> 03:30:16.096
MATT: He's now swimming in the water going, "Where
are you? No! You have so much to live for!"

03:30:16.096 --> 03:30:20.169
(laughter)

03:30:20.169 --> 03:30:22.070
MATT: That's their action. Caduceus?

03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:26.068
TALIESIN: I'm swimming full speed directly out
into the ocean.

03:30:26.068 --> 03:30:33.700
MATT: 30. That's as much as you can get. It's half
movement in the water.

03:30:33.700 --> 03:30:36.995
(laughter)

03:30:36.995 --> 03:30:39.017
SAM: He's never seen the ocean before.

03:30:39.017 --> 03:30:40.105
(laughter)

03:30:40.105 --> 03:30:42.022
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, no, I'm not having a good--

03:30:42.022 --> 03:30:42.793
LIAM: So brave.

03:30:42.793 --> 03:30:45.140
TALIESIN: --this is not going well for me. I'm not
a happy camper.

03:30:45.140 --> 03:30:46.455
SAM: Do you even have dark vision?

03:30:46.455 --> 03:30:47.583
MATT and TALIESIN: No.

03:30:47.583 --> 03:30:49.214
SAM: You're swimming out into the dark?

03:30:49.214 --> 03:30:50.641
(laughter)

03:30:50.641 --> 03:30:52.091
LIAM: There's torches, for now.

03:30:52.091 --> 03:30:56.022
MATT: Yeah, there's a single torch over here that
is loosely lighting the vicinity.

03:30:56.022 --> 03:30:59.632
TALIESIN: And, I assume that there's some kind of
light on the--

03:30:59.632 --> 03:31:07.097
MATT: For Caduceus-- you do have a high passive
perception. There <i>are</i> shapes in the water below.

03:31:07.097 --> 03:31:08.911
SAM: Oh my god!

03:31:09.502 --> 03:31:12.412
TALIESIN: Would I have noticed that before
swimming 30 feet out?

03:31:12.412 --> 03:31:18.684
MATT: No. They weren't immediately-- at night, no.
You're getting out under the dock and you-- and a

03:31:18.684 --> 03:31:23.120
little bit of light that's coming through from the
moonlight, you look and you can see something in

03:31:23.120 --> 03:31:24.549
the water.

03:31:24.549 --> 03:31:25.800
MARISHA: Oh god.

03:31:25.800 --> 03:31:27.686
MATT: That ends your turn. Yasha's go.

03:31:27.686 --> 03:31:29.283
TRAVIS: Oh, Yasha's...

03:31:29.283 --> 03:31:31.085
LIAM: 40 feet off the dock.

03:31:31.085 --> 03:31:32.861
MARISHA: Help me, Yasha!

03:31:32.861 --> 03:31:36.895
TRAVIS: Yasha assists Beau in getting the ship--

03:31:36.895 --> 03:31:39.682
MATT: Sure. You're just holding the ship. Not much
else to do.

03:31:39.682 --> 03:31:42.377
MARISHA: Oh my god!

03:31:42.377 --> 03:31:47.431
MATT: All right, so, at this point, Marius is--
there's not much else he can do. Fjord, your turn.

03:31:47.431 --> 03:31:53.532
TRAVIS: Keeping an eye out for Caduceus, start to
steer the ship along the coastline this way.

03:31:53.532 --> 03:31:55.564
MATT: All right, make a perception check, please.

03:31:55.564 --> 03:31:57.110
LIAM: Wow, Fjord.

03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:59.499
TRAVIS: 18.

03:31:59.499 --> 03:32:01.163
MATT: 18. You do...

03:32:01.163 --> 03:32:05.267
SAM: That's right. There's an old man swimming in
the ocean.

03:32:05.267 --> 03:32:06.394
MATT: You do see--

03:32:06.394 --> 03:32:10.053
(laughter)

03:32:10.053 --> 03:32:11.618
MARISHA: Geriatric bathing.

03:32:11.618 --> 03:32:12.995
SAM: Oh lord!

03:32:12.995 --> 03:32:14.669
(laughter)

03:32:14.669 --> 03:32:16.556
TALIESIN: This could not be more fucked.

03:32:16.556 --> 03:32:18.487
MATT: (laughter) I'm so happy!

03:32:18.487 --> 03:32:21.106
SAM: Don't worry. It's not what we came for. Keep
going!

03:32:21.106 --> 03:32:28.072
MATT: This went <i>so</i> far from any of my
expectations! I love Dungeons & Dragons!

03:32:28.072 --> 03:32:30.172
TRAVIS: No, fuck that guy. Where's Caduceus?

03:32:30.172 --> 03:32:36.236
MATT: All right, so keeping up with that, that
ends Fjord's turn. The boat now moves on

03:32:36.236 --> 03:32:38.773
initiative count 20 to there.

03:32:38.773 --> 03:32:40.404
LIAM: Look at that old fucker out there.

03:32:40.404 --> 03:32:44.070
MARISHA: Fucking skinny dippers. What the fuck?
Polar Bear Plunge.

03:32:44.070 --> 03:32:46.153
LIAM: Oh, it's <i>that</i> kind of city.

03:32:46.153 --> 03:32:49.606
MATT: All right. Beau and Nott, we'll say for the
purposes of expediency on this.

03:32:49.606 --> 03:32:53.476
SAM: Yeah, I just need some help tying this fucker
up. I bring him up to Fjord.

03:32:53.476 --> 03:32:58.236
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to let Caleb out from
below. I'm assuming I could have heard Caleb going--

03:32:58.543 --> 03:33:00.840
MATT: You felt the door go (thump). That's all you
know.

03:33:00.840 --> 03:33:03.533
LIAM: You assume I'm down there, I guess.

03:33:03.533 --> 03:33:04.995
LAURA: Well, if I look around--

03:33:04.995 --> 03:33:06.955
MATT: You don't see Caleb on the ship. Where's
Caleb?!

03:33:06.955 --> 03:33:08.693
LAURA: Where's Caleb?! I open the door! Caleb!

03:33:08.693 --> 03:33:09.998
MATT: Okay, Caleb's standing there.

03:33:09.998 --> 03:33:10.766
LAURA: Oh, Caleb.

03:33:10.766 --> 03:33:13.818
MATT: All right. Caleb, you doing anything?

03:33:13.818 --> 03:33:18.602
LIAM: Yeah. I turn to the guy who-- he picked up
his weapons by now?

03:33:18.602 --> 03:33:20.761
MATT: Yeah, he's making his way up the stairs
after you.

03:33:20.761 --> 03:33:23.936
LIAM: Yeah, okay, I reach out and use Catapult,
and a drawer pulls out of the desk and slams into

03:33:23.936 --> 03:33:25.167
the back of his head.

03:33:25.167 --> 03:33:26.573
MATT: Go ahead roll for attack.

03:33:26.573 --> 03:33:27.809
LIAM: Dex save for that.

03:33:27.809 --> 03:33:31.383
MATT: Oh, that's right. Ah, it's cocked. Natural
six.

03:33:31.383 --> 03:33:35.587
LIAM: Okay, it's a failure, so that is 3d8.

03:33:35.587 --> 03:33:38.838
SAM: Does the drawer have fruit in it, though?

03:33:38.838 --> 03:33:41.940
MATT: Well, yeah, scurvy, you know?

03:33:41.940 --> 03:33:44.767
LIAM: 17 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:33:44.767 --> 03:33:48.819
MATT: 17 points of damage. (crash) Right in the
back of the skull. He's like, "Ahh!", and you can

03:33:48.819 --> 03:33:52.688
see him holding back, he's holding the sword. He's
hurt. But he's still coming at you.

03:33:52.688 --> 03:33:56.629
LIAM: (arrow noise) I am standing next to Fjord and
Beau.

03:33:56.629 --> 03:34:02.784
MATT: (laughs) All right. With an immediate burst
of speed in a rush, very akin to The Flash making

03:34:02.784 --> 03:34:07.771
his way through the city, Caleb just (poof!)
appears there on top with Fjord and Beau.

03:34:07.771 --> 03:34:09.293
LIAM: Feels good, man.

03:34:09.293 --> 03:34:15.372
MATT: The guy who's now looking at you, Jester,
you see the guy had his sword out and, "Ah!",

03:34:15.372 --> 03:34:20.204
looks confused and sees you and goes, (growls) and
is going to come up with the sword. He doesn't

03:34:20.204 --> 03:34:25.778
realize how fucked he is. He doesn't know that the
ship has been taken. He's feeling pretty competent.

03:34:26.753 --> 03:34:28.188
LIAM: He's the only one having a worse day than
us.

03:34:28.188 --> 03:34:31.386
MATT: Probably. All right, so on that, he's going
to go ahead and make his way towards you, Jester.

03:34:31.386 --> 03:34:34.072
He comes up and is going to make two swings at
you.

03:34:34.072 --> 03:34:35.646
LAURA: I use Hellish Rebuke.

03:34:35.646 --> 03:34:41.197
MATT: Well, first you have to see if it hits. That
is going to be a 15 to hit. I believe that misses.

03:34:41.712 --> 03:34:42.395
LAURA: No.

03:34:42.395 --> 03:34:43.392
MATT: That's a 19 to hit.

03:34:43.392 --> 03:34:45.381
LAURA: Okay, yes. I use Hellish Rebuke.

03:34:45.381 --> 03:34:47.706
MATT: All right, go for it. That is ten points of
slashing damage to you.

03:34:47.706 --> 03:34:48.611
LAURA: Okay.

03:34:48.611 --> 03:34:50.632
MATT: A two-handed (whoosh) swings past you.

03:34:50.632 --> 03:34:54.804
LAURA: He takes 21 points of damage back.

03:34:54.804 --> 03:34:56.170
MATT: He has to make a save, right?

03:34:56.170 --> 03:34:56.859
LAURA: Yes.

03:34:56.859 --> 03:35:01.570
MATT: That is a natural 14, but has no bonus to
his dex, so it's a 14.

03:35:01.570 --> 03:35:03.500
LAURA: Yeah, it's only a 12 dex save.

03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:04.645
MATT: Right, because it's a racial ability.

03:35:04.645 --> 03:35:05.807
LAURA: Yeah, it's a racial ability.

03:35:05.807 --> 03:35:07.582
MATT: He takes half damage? What is it?

03:35:07.582 --> 03:35:09.896
LAURA: What did I say? 21? Half of that, 11.

03:35:09.896 --> 03:35:17.397
MATT: All right. Ice shards pierce out of the
blast area and his body is (groans). He's looking

03:35:17.397 --> 03:35:22.247
really hurt now, and he's frustrated and his eyes
are starting to go a little wild, realizing that

03:35:22.247 --> 03:35:44.074
this is turning on him pretty heavily. All right.
Caduceus. (counting) You're just like, (breathing

03:35:44.074 --> 03:35:45.492
hard). As you glance over--

03:35:45.492 --> 03:35:48.105
LIAM: (old man voice) Hey!

03:35:48.105 --> 03:35:50.167
TALIESIN: Little help here.

03:35:50.167 --> 03:35:51.931
MARISHA: Is that his voice?

03:35:51.931 --> 03:35:53.853
TALIESIN: I'm not doing a voice.

03:35:53.853 --> 03:35:57.723
MARISHA: Sounds so familiar. Man.

03:35:57.723 --> 03:36:03.190
TALIESIN: Not having a good day.

03:36:03.190 --> 03:36:05.897
LAURA: Whose turn is it to get him up?

03:36:05.897 --> 03:36:07.465
MARISHA: Yasha.

03:36:07.465 --> 03:36:11.040
MATT: All right, Yasha goes up and brings Caduceus
back onto the ship.

03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:18.497
MARISHA: Where the fuck were you? Who are you? You
are clearly Cad.

03:36:18.497 --> 03:36:22.466
LIAM: A miracle.

03:36:22.466 --> 03:36:24.566
LAURA: Fjord needs healing.

03:36:24.566 --> 03:36:27.877
TALIESIN: Do I have a bonus action?

03:36:27.877 --> 03:36:29.976
MATT: You have a bonus action.

03:36:29.976 --> 03:36:37.114
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Healing Word on Fjord
before I start doing another--

03:36:37.114 --> 03:36:39.027
LAURA: Prayer?

03:36:39.027 --> 03:36:43.817
TALIESIN: Yeah, before I start doing another
prayer, I'm going to cast Healing Word on Fjord

03:36:43.817 --> 03:36:45.054
really quickly, so.

03:36:45.054 --> 03:36:46.663
MATT: All right. You got it, Fjord.

03:36:46.663 --> 03:36:48.127
TALIESIN: That's seven points of hit points.

03:36:48.127 --> 03:36:52.633
MATT: Seven points to you. Fjord, anything? Just
keeping the ship going?

03:36:52.633 --> 03:36:54.265
TRAVIS: Just sail. Yep, just sail.

03:36:54.265 --> 03:36:56.221
LAURA: I go to the back of the boat to see the
name of the boat.

03:36:56.221 --> 03:37:02.779
MATT: On this way. The boat continues on for
another 20 or 30 feet-- actually 30 feet. It's

03:37:02.779 --> 03:37:05.885
starting to get a little speed and it's picking up
the wind as it's making its way curving out

03:37:05.885 --> 03:37:12.369
towards the harbor. The guards continue running
off. These guys are all searching for the body of

03:37:12.369 --> 03:37:13.983
the woman.

03:37:13.983 --> 03:37:16.241
LIAM: Heroes.

03:37:16.241 --> 03:37:20.248
SAM: We did it, guys. Mission accomplished.

03:37:20.248 --> 03:37:25.769
MATT: The Enforcer actually technically would have
his attack on this round. I missed that. The

03:37:25.877 --> 03:37:27.467
Enforcer does his attacks on you, Jester.

03:37:27.467 --> 03:37:30.833
LAURA: Okay. Can I hit back? Because I--

03:37:30.833 --> 03:37:32.381
MATT: Yeah, you can. It's your turn now.

03:37:32.381 --> 03:37:39.577
LAURA: Okay, then... yeah. I'm going to-- I get
two attacks, don't I? No, I just get one attack.

03:37:39.577 --> 03:37:41.058
MATT: You get one attack.

03:37:41.058 --> 03:37:42.416
SAM: (pigeon coo) Don't kill him.

03:37:42.416 --> 03:37:48.027
LAURA: I'm not going to. Instead of killing him,
I'm going to say, you probably don't want to

03:37:48.027 --> 03:37:51.976
attack me. We've got a boat full of people. We
just took your ship. You should put down your

03:37:51.976 --> 03:37:53.074
weapon.

03:37:53.074 --> 03:37:55.016
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

03:37:55.016 --> 03:37:59.178
TRAVIS: As she put her hands up, he can see her
flexing biceps.

03:37:59.178 --> 03:38:02.499
LAURA: Yeah. Intimidation, 13.

03:38:02.499 --> 03:38:04.644
MATT: 13? He doesn't buy it.

03:38:04.644 --> 03:38:09.399
LAURA: What? They're right here. Look behind me,
you stupid. Okay.

03:38:09.399 --> 03:38:14.479
MATT: He's like back in-- The deck isn't very
high. He can't really look and see the ship before

03:38:14.479 --> 03:38:19.398
you entirely. He's just seeing you right there in
the way. He's just hacking at you with his sword.

03:38:19.398 --> 03:38:20.327
LAURA: Okay.

03:38:20.327 --> 03:38:22.650
MATT: So the words don't come through. He thinks
it's a bluff.

03:38:22.650 --> 03:38:23.721
LAURA: Okay.

03:38:23.721 --> 03:38:25.039
MATT: Caleb.

03:38:25.039 --> 03:38:31.182
LIAM: Oh my goodness. Okay. I will go down after
Jester and stand behind her to see what the

03:38:31.182 --> 03:38:32.956
situation is with my movement.

03:38:32.956 --> 03:38:34.928
MATT: You are down next to her.

03:38:34.928 --> 03:38:42.660
LIAM: Oh goodness. I don't want to set the-- I
say, "Hey! Why don't you put down that weapon and

03:38:42.660 --> 03:38:49.663
let's talk about this?" and I cast Friends, which
would be a disadvantage, I'm sure. You have

03:38:49.663 --> 03:38:56.361
advantage on all charisma checks. Yeah, so: It's
very dangerous. You're going to die, probably

03:38:56.361 --> 03:38:59.543
sooner rather than later unless you want to talk
shop.

03:38:59.543 --> 03:39:00.788
MATT: Persuasion.

03:39:00.788 --> 03:39:02.691
LIAM: Persuasion with disadvantage?

03:39:02.691 --> 03:39:03.534
MATT: Disadvantage.

03:39:03.534 --> 03:39:05.309
LAURA: No, it's straight. Because you cast...

03:39:05.309 --> 03:39:06.338
LIAM: Straight?

03:39:06.338 --> 03:39:08.112
MATT: Yeah, what did you roll?

03:39:08.112 --> 03:39:11.284
LIAM: Seven. Shit. That's persuasion, ten.

03:39:11.284 --> 03:39:14.336
MATT: No, you guys are all standing on the door
and going like, "Come on, bud. Come on!" He's

03:39:14.336 --> 03:39:17.958
going, "No! No! You're lying!"

03:39:17.958 --> 03:39:20.770
LIAM: I don't want to burn with the boat.

03:39:20.770 --> 03:39:26.199
MATT: Yeah, the guards aren't an issue anymore at
the moment. Caduceus, anything you need to do? Or

03:39:26.199 --> 03:39:27.238
you just holding on the ship?

03:39:27.238 --> 03:39:28.980
TALIESIN: I'm sitting and starting a Prayer of
Healing.

03:39:28.980 --> 03:39:33.175
MATT: Got you. All right. Bringing it back. Fjord,
anything? Holding the ship. Ship continues off.

03:39:33.175 --> 03:39:37.133
You guys are picking up speed now as the wind has
come in and the ship is now making its way.

03:39:37.133 --> 03:39:40.365
LAURA: Honestly, I think we did a pretty good job
after everything.

03:39:40.365 --> 03:39:42.136
MATT: You turned it around a little bit.

03:39:42.136 --> 03:39:43.383
LAURA: We got a ship!

03:39:43.383 --> 03:39:44.451
MATT: That was going bad.

03:39:44.451 --> 03:39:45.911
LIAM: This is fucking fun.

03:39:45.911 --> 03:39:48.358
MATT: Oh, yeah. That's why I love when shit goes
wrong like this. These are my favorite moments in

03:39:48.358 --> 03:39:53.208
D&D. The Enforcer is going to go ahead and take
two more attacks on you.

03:39:53.208 --> 03:39:56.148
TRAVIS: Nobody's going down there to help Jester?

03:39:56.148 --> 03:39:57.461
SAM: I don't know.

03:39:57.461 --> 03:40:00.341
LAURA: I'm going like "Ow, ow, ow!"

03:40:00.341 --> 03:40:06.402
MATT: You know what, no! He does see Caleb. Now
actively takes a look behind, and then turns

03:40:06.402 --> 03:40:07.907
around and runs down below deck.

03:40:07.907 --> 03:40:09.733
SAM: Wait, there's more below?

03:40:09.733 --> 03:40:11.652
LAURA: He just ran back down.

03:40:11.652 --> 03:40:14.491
MATT: He's running down below deck. You do get an
attack of opportunity if you want to take it,

03:40:14.491 --> 03:40:15.072
Jester.

03:40:15.072 --> 03:40:16.077
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

03:40:16.077 --> 03:40:17.424
MARISHA: Kill him.

03:40:17.424 --> 03:40:18.865
TRAVIS: Toll the Dead.

03:40:18.865 --> 03:40:25.616
LAURA: No, it has to be my handaxe. Yeah, that
definitely hits, 25.

03:40:25.616 --> 03:40:27.228
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

03:40:27.228 --> 03:40:30.488
LAURA: Ten points of damage.

03:40:30.488 --> 03:40:39.605
MATT: As he turns around, you're like, "No, wait!"
(shunk) Into the back of his skull. He falls and

03:40:39.605 --> 03:40:44.367
(thump), slides down the stairs limply.

03:40:44.367 --> 03:40:53.596
LAURA: I think I'm going to use my cantrip Spare
the Dying and make sure he doesn't die die. Does

03:40:53.596 --> 03:40:55.111
he die die?

03:40:55.111 --> 03:40:57.235
MATT: I mean, you put an axe to the back of his
head.

03:40:57.235 --> 03:41:02.547
LAURA: I didn't want to kill him. Like that wasn't
my goal, but I didn't say that out loud.

03:41:02.547 --> 03:41:05.107
MATT: You didn't say that out loud.

03:41:05.107 --> 03:41:06.424
LIAM: Stress of the moment.

03:41:06.424 --> 03:41:07.835
SAM: He dead.

03:41:07.835 --> 03:41:11.204
MATT: It's not your turn. You don't have a bonus
action because it's a reaction. You wouldn't be

03:41:11.204 --> 03:41:12.410
able to use it until next round.

03:41:12.410 --> 03:41:13.732
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:41:13.732 --> 03:41:18.064
LAURA: Sorry, it really wasn't my intention to do
that. I was aiming for his shoulder, and I missed

03:41:18.064 --> 03:41:19.384
and hit his head.

03:41:19.384 --> 03:41:21.557
TRAVIS: It Wasn't My Intention: the name of this
episode.

03:41:21.557 --> 03:41:23.010
MARISHA: That's great!

03:41:23.010 --> 03:41:25.509
TALIESIN: That, or the AC of Wood.

03:41:25.509 --> 03:41:29.435
MATT: The AC of Wood is a good Alpha title.

03:41:29.435 --> 03:41:32.095
TALIESIN: From "It wasn't my intention."

03:41:32.095 --> 03:41:41.589
MATT: As you pull away out into the main harbor,
Fjord, for the first time in a long time you

03:41:41.589 --> 03:41:52.977
feel-- as the stress of the sequence passes over
you, the sensation of being at the helm of a ship

03:41:52.977 --> 03:42:02.958
bypasses the momentary frustration. It feels good
to feel that wind in your hair again and to be

03:42:02.958 --> 03:42:08.928
guiding it through the waters and seeing the dark
horizon in the distance. You feel that bald rage

03:42:08.928 --> 03:42:16.233
subside. Looking past, you can see the guards are
still running up the streets with their torches.

03:42:16.233 --> 03:42:19.175
There'll probably be a search party.

03:42:19.175 --> 03:42:25.827
MARISHA and LAURA: (sing-song) You can never go
back!

03:42:25.827 --> 03:42:32.689
MATT: The good news is, you don't think they were
paying attention to the back of he ship, thanks to

03:42:32.689 --> 03:42:37.627
the distraction that you set, so they don't know
the name of the ship. That might help to your advantage.

03:42:37.632 --> 03:42:39.442
MARISHA: Which is?

03:42:40.578 --> 03:42:42.503
MATT: It is called--

03:42:42.503 --> 03:42:43.941
LAURA: Widow's Embrace?

03:42:43.941 --> 03:42:46.360
MATT: No, it is not. It is called The Mist.

03:42:46.360 --> 03:42:48.585
TRAVIS: With an I or a Y?

03:42:48.585 --> 03:42:50.185
MATT: With a I.

03:42:50.185 --> 03:42:52.163
LAURA: The Mist.

03:42:52.163 --> 03:43:01.213
MATT: Now pushing past midnight to the very early
morning hours, you make your way out and as far

03:43:01.213 --> 03:43:06.312
away from the edge. You can see the lights of
Nicodranas begin to fade a bit, just enough where

03:43:06.312 --> 03:43:13.408
you can feel comfortable. Marius is there bound by
ropes. There, still wild eyed, and looking at all

03:43:13.408 --> 03:43:21.135
this, "All right, then. Who the fuck are you?"

03:43:21.135 --> 03:43:25.492
MARISHA: Who the fuck are you? You piece of shit!

03:43:25.492 --> 03:43:27.030
SAM: We know his name.

03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:31.872
MARISHA: I know who he is! I'm asking him! Fucking
piece of shit.

03:43:31.872 --> 03:43:33.630
LIAM: That's all we know is his name.

03:43:33.630 --> 03:43:39.069
MATT: "My name is Marius LePual."

03:43:39.069 --> 03:43:43.811
MARISHA: No, we know! I'm saying you're a piece of
shit!

03:43:43.811 --> 03:43:45.471
MATT: "What did I do?"

03:43:45.471 --> 03:43:47.176
MARISHA: So many things.

03:43:47.176 --> 03:43:48.848
MATT: "I'm very confused."

03:43:48.848 --> 03:43:51.478
LIAM: What were you doing on the docks this
evening?

03:43:51.478 --> 03:44:06.845
MATT: He looks around, he's like, "I was coming to
tell some business contacts of mine that something

03:44:06.845 --> 03:44:08.846
"they hired me for didn't pan out."

03:44:08.846 --> 03:44:12.005
LAURA: (gasp)

03:44:12.005 --> 03:44:14.636
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:44:14.636 --> 03:44:25.547
LAURA: Do you happen to know where those business
contacts came from, these people? Do you know?

03:44:25.547 --> 03:44:27.874
MATT: "I don't know, they're very mysterious."

03:44:27.874 --> 03:44:32.921
TRAVIS: Would it mean anything if we said that we
come bearing gifts and that we are looking to see

03:44:32.921 --> 03:44:38.150
the Captain? I'll reach behind my hand and use
Minor Illusion and create a little replica of the

03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:41.358
cat eye sphere and hold it out in front of him.

03:44:41.358 --> 03:44:52.113
MATT: Okay. He goes, "Why didn't you say that in
the beginning?"

03:44:52.113 --> 03:44:56.831
MARISHA: I did say that. I kind of did. I was
like, Gentleman.

03:44:56.831 --> 03:45:02.214
MATT: "I don't know a Gentleman. I just know that
I was supposed to look for that delivery."

03:45:02.214 --> 03:45:04.869
TRAVIS: From who?

03:45:04.869 --> 03:45:10.481
MATT: "Whoever was going to bring it. I didn't
expect for you to come in here and slaughter my contacts."

03:45:12.181 --> 03:45:15.439
TRAVIS: What are your ambitions with it?

03:45:15.439 --> 03:45:19.343
MATT: "Nothing. I was going to make some coin,
pass it over. That was it."

03:45:19.343 --> 03:45:22.849
MARISHA: He's a runner. Who were you supposed to
deliver it to?

03:45:22.849 --> 03:45:24.354
MATT: "I don't know. Mysterious folk."

03:45:24.354 --> 03:45:26.191
LAURA: The guy we just killed?

03:45:26.191 --> 03:45:29.351
MARISHA: Mysterious folk. Where were you supposed
to drop it off? You knew where you were supposed

03:45:29.351 --> 03:45:31.551
to deliver it, so where were you supposed to
deliver it?

03:45:31.551 --> 03:45:37.881
MATT: "It was supposed to come find me in the
cove, never showed up, and they had been waiting

03:45:38.169 --> 03:45:42.286
"in town for a few days, and they were coming back
and I-- this was the night where I was supposed to

03:45:42.286 --> 03:45:45.363
"tell them-- either bring it to them or the deal
was off and I was supposed to give back the money

03:45:45.363 --> 03:45:48.405
"that I owed them. So-- "

03:45:48.405 --> 03:45:52.510
LIAM: I would like to point out that you're
trapped on this boat with us.

03:45:52.510 --> 03:45:57.888
MATT: "I know that! I am very well aware of that
right now. I'm a little freaked out, not going to lie."

03:45:58.250 --> 03:46:02.184
LIAM: Tomorrow my blue friend is going to, if we
need to, cast a spell on you and make you tell us

03:46:02.184 --> 03:46:05.505
everything we want to know. Why waste that time?

03:46:05.505 --> 03:46:08.557
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

03:46:08.557 --> 03:46:14.779
LAURA: There's also maps downstairs. I don't know
that, he knows that, never mind.

03:46:17.449 --> 03:46:18.995
LIAM: 21.

03:46:18.995 --> 03:46:28.549
MATT: He goes, "Right. I'm being truthful. I
know it was supposed to be for a captain, Captain

03:46:28.943 --> 03:46:38.224
Avantika. She's a right intense person. I've only
seen her once. She doesn't really leave her ship

03:46:38.224 --> 03:46:43.969
in port, when she's in, which is rare. Her
reputation keeps her not from coming in directly."

03:46:43.969 --> 03:46:45.760
LAURA: What's the name of her ship?

03:46:45.760 --> 03:46:48.091
MATT: "Well, her ship is the Squall Eater."

03:46:48.091 --> 03:46:50.593
MARISHA: Squall Eater?

03:46:50.593 --> 03:46:55.323
LIAM: Her reputation keeps her from coming in.
What is her reputation?

03:46:55.323 --> 03:47:02.572
MATT: "She's a bit of a forceful taker of things
she wants."

03:47:02.572 --> 03:47:04.792
LAURA: She's a pirate!

03:47:04.792 --> 03:47:10.882
MATT: "That's one word to say it. If you want to
find her, your best bet is probably somewhere in

03:47:10.882 --> 03:47:16.892
"the Swavain Islands. Don't know where directly.
I'm just hired as the errand boy."

03:47:16.892 --> 03:47:18.835
SAM: The Slavain Islands?

03:47:18.835 --> 03:47:38.099
MATT: Swavain. S-W-A-V-A-I-N. "I was just supposed
to come back here. Supposed to meet up with the

03:47:38.099 --> 03:47:47.410
folks of the Mist, the ship that you've now
commandeered. You've killed them all. What are you

03:47:47.420 --> 03:47:49.157
going to do with me?"

03:47:49.157 --> 03:47:50.853
LIAM: That is a good question.

03:47:50.853 --> 03:47:55.942
MATT: "I'm useful. I'm helpful! I can swab the
deck. I can cook."

03:47:55.942 --> 03:47:57.485
LAURA: Ooh!

03:47:57.485 --> 03:47:59.257
LIAM: What can you cook? That's interesting.

03:47:59.257 --> 03:48:01.205
MATT: "What you got?"

03:48:01.205 --> 03:48:04.777
SAM: We don't know what we got. We stole this
ship.

03:48:04.777 --> 03:48:06.395
MATT: "Yeah, yeah you did."

03:48:06.395 --> 03:48:08.357
TRAVIS: Have we patted him down?

03:48:08.357 --> 03:48:08.998
LIAM: No.

03:48:08.998 --> 03:48:10.032
SAM: I'll pat him down.

03:48:10.032 --> 03:48:11.666
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:48:11.666 --> 03:48:14.713
TALIESIN: By this point, by the way, everyone has
16 hit points added to their--

03:48:14.713 --> 03:48:16.854
SAM: 18 for investigation.

03:48:16.854 --> 03:48:22.489
MATT: Okay, you find a pouch of 20 platinum
pieces.

03:48:22.489 --> 03:48:24.705
LAURA: That's the money he was going to return.

03:48:24.705 --> 03:48:25.914
SAM: That's a lot.

03:48:25.914 --> 03:48:27.813
LAURA: That's what he got paid.

03:48:27.813 --> 03:48:35.451
MATT: You find another pouch that's hidden within
his belt pouch that contains 62 gold pieces, three

03:48:35.451 --> 03:48:42.649
silver, 50 copper, and what looks to be a pouch of
chewing tobacco.

03:48:42.649 --> 03:48:54.467
SAM: Okay. What <i>looks</i> to be a pouch of chewing
tobacco. Okay, got it. Could be spice.

03:48:54.467 --> 03:49:01.494
MATT: "Well, so you're not going to kill me,
right?"

03:49:01.494 --> 03:49:02.881
TRAVIS: We're not sure yet.

03:49:02.881 --> 03:49:05.222
LAURA: We're probably not going to kill you.

03:49:05.222 --> 03:49:11.010
MATT: "That's fine. That's good odds. I'll take
those odds. Can you at least loosen these a bit."

03:49:11.010 --> 03:49:13.527
TRAVIS: Tighten them and tie him to the mast will
you.

03:49:13.527 --> 03:49:19.765
MATT: As Yasha picks him up and ties him to the
mast, he's like, "Oh!"

03:49:19.765 --> 03:49:21.507
LIAM: Maybe you'll earn your way to that, we'll
see.

03:49:21.507 --> 03:49:24.395
MATT: "Okay, well, where are we going then?"

03:49:24.395 --> 03:49:28.102
LAURA: You'll find out soon enough.

03:49:28.102 --> 03:49:32.983
MARISHA: I take a handkerchief and I shove it into
his mouth, and tie that around too.

03:49:32.983 --> 03:49:34.337
SAM: Did we show him this letter?

03:49:34.337 --> 03:49:35.908
LAURA: I mean we already said.

03:49:35.908 --> 03:49:41.500
SAM: I know but, we don't know who this letter was
written to, do we? We know who it was from and

03:49:41.500 --> 03:49:45.598
what it was telling the person-- wait no, it's
from--

03:49:45.598 --> 03:49:46.431
LAURA: Ionos.

03:49:46.431 --> 03:49:48.370
SAM: Ionos. Do you know Ionos?

03:49:48.370 --> 03:49:50.246
LAURA: Take the thing off.

03:49:51.486 --> 03:49:53.631
SAM: Do you know Ionos?

03:49:53.631 --> 03:49:55.609
MATT: "No, I don't know an Ionos."

03:49:55.609 --> 03:49:56.916
TRAVIS: Shove it back in.

03:49:56.916 --> 03:50:00.153
(laughing)

03:50:01.163 --> 03:50:06.548
SAM: Well I'm glad we killed a half dozen people
to know what we already knew.

03:50:06.548 --> 03:50:08.918
(laughing)

03:50:09.364 --> 03:50:10.298
LAURA: We didn't know that already.

03:50:10.298 --> 03:50:12.567
LIAM: We did not know about Avantika or her ship.

03:50:12.567 --> 03:50:15.518
SAM: Sure, her name's right here. It says "Meet
the Captain, Avantika."

03:50:15.518 --> 03:50:16.543
LAURA: We didn't know she was the captain.

03:50:16.543 --> 03:50:17.681
LIAM: We didn't know anything about her.

03:50:17.681 --> 03:50:18.776
SAM: We could have asked.

03:50:18.776 --> 03:50:22.107
LAURA: We didn't know what her ship was about.
Let's go downstairs. Maybe we can find something useful.

03:50:22.107 --> 03:50:25.382
MARISHA: To be fair, the goal was to just ask, and
then it got out of hand.

03:50:25.382 --> 03:50:28.303
TRAVIS: Maybe there will be lunch meats down there
and we can make a sandwich.

03:50:28.303 --> 03:50:30.149
(laughing)

03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:32.239
LIAM: Caleb's heading down to start searching.

03:50:32.239 --> 03:50:33.256
LAURA: I'll follow him.

03:50:33.256 --> 03:50:39.454
MATT: As you guys all head down below deck to take
in what exactly you have at your disposal, as you

03:50:39.454 --> 03:50:43.105
are now the current owners of the Mist.

03:50:43.105 --> 03:50:45.174
MARISHA: You guys, we own a ship!

03:50:45.174 --> 03:50:47.741
TALIESIN: A ship, a dog, an owl, a ferret.

03:50:47.741 --> 03:50:49.544
SAM: We don't have our dog anymore.

03:50:49.544 --> 03:50:55.844
MARISHA: Oh yeah! (yelling) Professor Thaddeus!
(hooting) Professor Thaddeus?

03:50:55.844 --> 03:50:57.692
MATT: Professor Thaddeus is somewhere at the
city.

03:50:57.692 --> 03:51:01.216
TRAVIS: Oh! First pet down.

03:51:01.216 --> 03:51:05.476
MARISHA: I'm going to try to throw up some bait.
(hooting)

03:51:05.476 --> 03:51:07.196
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

03:51:07.196 --> 03:51:10.799
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to roll big. I'm not
going to roll big. I'm going to roll great.

03:51:10.799 --> 03:51:12.540
LIAM: We're like a quarter of a mile out to sea.

03:51:12.540 --> 03:51:14.809
MARISHA: I had him with me. 19.

03:51:14.809 --> 03:51:16.250
MATT: Not while fighting.

03:51:16.250 --> 03:51:19.337
MARISHA: Yeah, I imagine when I fought I was like,
"Go, hang out."

03:51:19.337 --> 03:51:20.342
MATT: Total of what?

03:51:20.342 --> 03:51:21.593
MARISHA: 19.

03:51:21.593 --> 03:51:26.617
MATT: 19. You're shouting out to the sky. Time
passes. No Professor Thaddeus.

03:51:26.617 --> 03:51:28.819
TRAVIS: He's eating mice.

03:51:28.819 --> 03:51:34.581
MARISHA: He is. He's happy. He's happier that way.
He was like me. He's not meant to be tied down.

03:51:34.581 --> 03:51:37.388
TALIESIN: Wow, I want to say it so bad. I'm not
going to say it.

03:51:37.388 --> 03:51:41.033
TALIESIN: He's doing what he loves best. Ignoring
everything else.

03:51:41.033 --> 03:51:44.714
SAM: We'll have a proper burial at sea.

03:51:44.714 --> 03:51:49.395
MARISHA: He's not dead. He's just running far away
from me.

03:51:49.395 --> 03:51:51.276
TRAVIS: Or he's chasing the ship and he can't
catch up.

03:51:51.276 --> 03:51:53.768
MARISHA: Professor!

03:51:53.768 --> 03:52:00.495
MATT: As you head down below deck to take stock of
what you have, we're going to end there. We'll

03:52:00.495 --> 03:52:02.063
pick up next week.

03:52:02.063 --> 03:52:04.105
SAM: Everything went great.

03:52:04.105 --> 03:52:09.819
LAURA: I think it was fun! Honestly, I think it
was terrible but it was cool.

03:52:09.819 --> 03:52:11.413
LIAM: Yeah, it was so much fun.

03:52:11.413 --> 03:52:12.887
TALIESIN: Oh man, that was a lot.

03:52:12.887 --> 03:52:16.639
LAURA: Think about when we got our flying carpet.
Like, we didn't mean to get the flying carpet. We

03:52:16.639 --> 03:52:19.408
ended up bringing the entire tower down upon
ourselves, right?

03:52:19.408 --> 03:52:21.074
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:52:21.074 --> 03:52:23.622
TRAVIS: That map is gorgeous!

03:52:23.622 --> 03:52:25.751
MATT: Thank you! That was fun.

03:52:25.751 --> 03:52:27.732
SAM: What would the captain have told us, though?

03:52:28.161 --> 03:52:28.932
LAURA: Who knows!

03:52:28.932 --> 03:52:32.080
MATT: Who knows. He got splattered.

03:52:32.080 --> 03:52:34.131
TRAVIS: He didn't even make an attack.

03:52:34.131 --> 03:52:39.705
MATT: No he didn't! He was going to be the nasty
one.

03:52:39.705 --> 03:52:40.871
LAURA: Yay!

03:52:40.871 --> 03:52:52.267
MATT: Anyways, well done, guys. You have a boat
and a handful of people in the city that saw your

03:52:52.267 --> 03:52:54.305
faces. Most of your faces.

03:52:54.305 --> 03:52:58.864
MARISHA: Man, thanks for that. You keep presenting
with stuff that we don't really want, but then we

03:52:58.864 --> 03:53:04.838
see it and we're like, "We need it!" Then we don't
want it, like animals. Now we have a boat.

03:53:04.838 --> 03:53:11.069
MATT: You have a weasel and your mom has a puppy.
And there's an owl somewhere.

03:53:11.069 --> 03:53:17.420
LAURA: Well think about, nobody that saw us in the
city, saw us taking the boat lived to tell the

03:53:17.420 --> 03:53:20.924
tale. Just kidding, all of the guards right there
did.

03:53:20.924 --> 03:53:23.148
LIAM: Nicodranas!

03:53:23.148 --> 03:53:28.093
SAM: Do we go on to the next town, or do we try
to--

03:53:28.093 --> 03:53:31.028
MATT: That's up to you guys to figure out next
time we come around.

03:53:31.028 --> 03:53:32.298
SAM: Oh my god.

03:53:32.298 --> 03:53:40.058
MATT: Well done. We'll pick this up next week and
see where the Mighty Nein are going, what they're

03:53:40.058 --> 03:53:45.331
planning to do and what the next leg of their
adventure is. Until then, have a wonderful night,

03:53:45.331 --> 03:53:49.490
have a wonderful week, we love you, and is it
Thursday yet? Good night.

03:54:01.370 --> 04:06:36.148
